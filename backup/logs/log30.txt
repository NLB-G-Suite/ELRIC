<PokemonStar> Congratz~
<Roleplay4life> 5What's so great about shinies anyways? :|
<Roleplay4life> 5(Lol I kid. Congrats.)
<PokemonStar> They're shiny
*Quanyails 7offers RP4L an Unusual Hat.
<NightSeas> 12There rare
<Roleplay4life> 5Yeah, but other than that?
<NightSeas> 12Sorta
<Quanyails> 7They're* (sorry).
<Hooh54> 4Thank you! She's female, and her name is Glory
<Icydragon> Hey Dark_Shadow_Dragon
<Quanyails> 7And if you're wondering, my night daze is currently over.
<prince-dari> What's the point in diamonds?
<Hooh54> 4Dialga
<prince-dari> They're rare and they're shiny.
<Roleplay4life> 5There isn't one. They're overpriced and the miners who dig them up are underpaid.
<prince-dari> It was just an analogy as you asked the point of shiny pokemon.
<NightSeas> 12*There
*NightSeas runs
<NightSeas> 12I know it's they're
<Hooh54> 4Pidgey pidge pidge
<Chimera> 04[21:32:46] <Roleplay4life> 5There isn't one. They're overpriced and the miners who dig them up are underpaid. <-- win.
<prince-dari> Surprisingly interesting.
<Roleplay4life> 5;D
<Roleplay4life> 5That's why I don't own any diamond jewelry... I have a few amethyst pieces but that's because my folks got them for me.
<prince-dari> You're starving the poor diamond miners! :P
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(eXAKR02)03WB* - <eXAKR> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon-Punching bendy buses!
<Hooh54> 4FALCON PAWNCH
<NightSeas> 12[19:35] <prince-dari> You're starving the poor diamond miners! :P <-- Hmm, never thought of it, but there might be some truth to that XD
<Roleplay4life> 5But there are like 9000+ other people who buy diamond jewelry all the time. =P
<NightSeas> 12True
<prince-dari> I thought diamond prices were just kept artificially high by pretty much one main company restricting supply anyway?
<prince-dari> Unless that was something else.
<Chimera> 04huh.
<NightSeas> 12Interesting. I’ll have to look into that
<NightSeas> 12Diamonds are only rare because of how hard it is to mine them I think
<Roleplay4life> 5Well, they're also rare minerally.
<Hooh54> 4I like how it all went from Pidgies to Diamonds. I also agree with Nightseas.
<Roleplay4life> 5But I dunno. I'm no expert. /shrug
<prince-dari> "The topic typically comes up when the diamond shopper makes a comment about De Beers owning vast supplies of rough diamonds and keeping diamond prices artificially high."
<Roleplay4life> 5Huh!
<Roleplay4life> 5How 'bout that.
<Roleplay4life> 5Always the strangest conversations over here at TST Chat. xD
<Hooh54> 4New topic: Birds
<NightSeas> 12Indeed
<Cynder7> 6I see peoples! :D
<prince-dari> I'm fairly sure that's illegal here, the competition comission would be onto them, or so I would have thought.
<Hooh54> 4I need a pet bird
<prince-dari> Then go and buy one?
<Icydragon> Holy shiz
<Hooh54> 4The thing is, I don't have enough space in my house D :
<NightSeas> 12I like little birds the most
<Armads> Pizza.
<Armads> I have it.
<NightSeas> 12But they need a lot a space too
<Icydragon> 12Follow me...
<Roleplay4life> 5I want to get a pet fish, since a fish is the only kind of pet I can have in my dorm this fall.
<NightSeas> 12of*
<Cynder7> 6Why..?
<Roleplay4life> 5I'm thinking of getting a Betta. Anyone ever had them?
<NightSeas> 12Nope
<Armads> Betta are easy to take care of
<Roleplay4life> 5Or **one, whatever.
<Icydragon> 12I found a way into Narnia
<Armads> as long as you only have one.
<Armads> lol
<Roleplay4life> 5Well obviously.
<Roleplay4life> 5Otherwise they'll fight each other. D:
<Hooh54> 4Finches, especially. I'm looking into a small conure or parakeet, trust me, I'm good with birds. And Roleplay, beta are great fish.
<Armads> yeh
<Armads> +a
<Icydragon> 12Dari: Mmmm not really

<HyperMetalLugia> Fads
<SilverSonic> EW NO
<prince-dari> No, not you HML, bronies love and tolerate everyone else.
<SilverSonic> it doesnt deserve to be called a franchise
<Darkdragon> Why not? Too afraid?
<eXAKR> The Gilda episode was better
<eXAKR> That one featured Gilda getting pranked
<Darkdragon> Gilda... It could've gone better.
<eXAKR> With COMBUSTIBLE LEMONS
<HyperMetalLugia> Who is gilda
<HyperMetalLugia> Sounds like Hilda
<SilverSonic> MLP is a dumb cartoon
<prince-dari> Gilda is griffon.

<Darkdragon> 3Dude, it's comedic effect.
<Cynder7> 6AWESOME.
<NightSeas> 12Someone is about to be ponyed
<SilverSonic> Ponies arent funny, and i know im not either
<prince-dari> It's exaggeration, and cartoons aren't usually known for realism.

<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Darkdragon> 3Love and tolerance is not good to make people believe

<Icydragon> 12Bring it
<Darkdragon> 3And ponies are bad why?
<Chimera> 04hey Prince-Dari?
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Chimera> 04I reached a fatal problem x-x
<SilverSonic> because they are annoying creatures
<prince-dari> Yes...?
<Chimera> 04Is there a way I can on-the-fly move a registration point?
<Darkdragon> 3Explain why, please?
<Cynder7> 6I'ma play TS2..I shall bbl. ^^
<SilverSonic> i just did
<Chimera> 04Like, it's at the top-left corner but I need it to be at the bottom
<SilverSonic> they are annoying
<prince-dari> Darkdragon: Most probably because people post them everywhere, and go on about them too much.
<eXAKR> There's a pony farm in the bowels of Aperture Science
<prince-dari> Overexposure to something you don't like IS annoying.
<Chimera> 04lol
<Icydragon> 12lololol sonic fanbase
<prince-dari> Registration point isn't important though, why?
<SilverSonic> ^
<Chimera> 04so um, there any way I can remidy this?
<Chimera> 04yes it is actually
<Darkdragon> 3We don't post them in places other then the pony club, and the Last poster wins, and you can just not look at those if you wish
<Chimera> 04see, it's what controls the X-axis
<Chimera> 04erm
<NightSeas> 12But really, you pony hater take this too seriously12 o-o
<Chimera> 04no, the X and Y axis
<eXAKR> It's just... ponies!
<NightSeas> 12haters*
<Chimera> 04so let's say I make it that the symbol is swapped with another symbol
<HyperMetalLugia> Well you guys see
<Chimera> 04it'll swap it in relation to the registration point
<Darkdragon> 3Yes?
<HyperMetalLugia> This is a GENERAL chat...
<Chimera> 04So I could have Spinarak floating in the air
<HyperMetalLugia> And if it's a general chat...there shouldn't really be a whole pile of pony stuff :p
<Chimera> 04When I need it to be on the ground
<HyperMetalLugia> But oh well
<Chimera> 04Get what I mean, dari?
<Darkdragon> 3Okay, we could do something else. (Such as code spam~)
<SilverSonic> No.
<prince-dari> You could move the mc inside the mc dynamically.
<SilverSonic> take Spamming to #ircgames
<prince-dari> It doesn't matter, thought if you show me the problem it'll be easier for me to explain how to fix it.
<Darkdragon> 3Dude, it was a joke.
<SilverSonic> :P
<eXAKR> ...
<NightSeas> 12Hmm, most of us bronys also like 5th gen, so lets talk about 5th gen!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02.-.
<eXAKR> RESHIRAM!
<Darkdragon> 3okay.
<eXAKR> That is all.
<Darkdragon> 3ZEKROM
<SilverSonic> but im being serious, if you want to spam take it to IRCgames
<Darkdragon> 3Is better
<prince-dari> Anything other than 1st gen pokemon, ew.
<HyperMetalLugia> Even though I dislike 5th gen, I perfer it over MLP x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> Fact
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh guys
<Darkdragon> 3Hey, you said that we wouldn't talk of ponies
<HyperMetalLugia> hm, actually
<HyperMetalLugia> PM then :P
<Darkdragon> 3and yet you bring it up anyway
<NightSeas> 12Na, a PM would not be fun. We want to turn more people into bronys.
<eXAKR> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7PGKcikaGY&feature=channel_video_title
<Darkdragon> 3Yup
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02That won't happen if you annoy us with constant talking of it.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Just like when we talk about MHT and HML gets mad
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<prince-dari> MHT?
<HyperMetalLugia> Monster hunter Tri
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<prince-dari> No idea what that is.

<Lunar> Hey
<SirSprinkles> Hey.
<SirSprinkles> Sorry about being such a flank.
<SirSprinkles> I'm SUPER stressed, just found out my best friend is in the hospital.
<Hooh54> 4I have school tomorrow >.>
<Lunar> It's whatever, honestly. As you could probably tell, I'm not in a good mood
<Lunar> Well, I hope they get better, honestly.
<Lunar> That sucks
<SirSprinkles> Nopony seems to know what happened... so that's what's really got me going.
<SirSprinkles> Yeah, I kinda picked a bad time to get iffy in the first place... so, yeah.
<SirSprinkles> Thanks for hearing me out.
<Chimera> 04^
<Icydragon> 12;D
<Hooh54> 4School is boring
<Lunar> Eeehhh. That sucks
<Lunar> Well, in any case. You're by yourself in second place now, and you'll have to wait a week or two to challenge for the crown
<Lunar> Dems just the rules, friend
<Lunar> Not a problem
<Lunar> Hope your friend gets better
<Icydragon> 12I know, good thing I'm out
<Light_Latias> night all~
<Icydragon> 12night
<SirSprinkles> I have every reason to wait for now, anyway.
<SirSprinkles> Gotta widen that gap. >>;
<Hooh54> 4Night Lati!
<SirSprinkles> Wait... what did you lose? Your palindrome?
<Lunar> No
<SirSprinkles> ??
<Lunar> I was extremely confident in my abilities
<Lunar> and wagered all my GETs
<SirSprinkles> Oo
<SirSprinkles> Oh.
<SirSprinkles> I see why you're so upset now.
<Lunar> Hence the pic/Life in Black vid on the site now
<SirSprinkles> Yeah... I was wondering why you didn't just change the list to put you in 4th like you would have been...
<SirSprinkles> Well, if I can get up to 42 points in a month or so, so can you!
<Hooh54> 4Hello
<Roleplay4life> 5Hey~
<Roleplay4life> 5Nyaaa, where is everyone?
<Lunar> I have a different plan.

<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02sleeping
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02I can't sleep =\
<Icydragon> 12me either
<Roleplay4life> 5It's only 10:30 PM here.
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02it's 11:00pm here
<baadf00d> 23:37 here lol
<Roleplay4life> 5I won't go to bed until midnight or so.
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02and I have school at 6am tomorrow
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02x-x
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh noes!
<Roleplay4life> 5So happy I'm out. xD
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02Well, I'll try to sleep (Again)
<Roleplay4life> 5Are you in a university yet?
<baadf00d> I have school at
<baadf00d> two weeks ago
<Roleplay4life> 5(@Ray)
<baadf00d> at 7am :O
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02Nope, High school xD
<Roleplay4life> 5Man that's early.
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02I know
<Roleplay4life> 5I didn't start classes until 7:45 AM.
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02;-;
<Roleplay4life> 5This fall none of my classes will begin until about 9:30. (Yessssss!!)
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02^^
<Ray||ZzZzZ> 02Anyway, if I don't get to sleep I'll come back. seeya~
<baadf00d> lol
<Roleplay4life> 5See ya! (: Hope you can get some sleep~
<baadf00d> 6:00 ain't that early for high school.
<baadf00d> I was always ready to leave the house by then
<baadf00d> back when I was in xth grade.
<baadf00d> Annoying but it's doable. lol
<Hooh54> 4Hello everyone
<baadf00d> \o
<baadf00d> I am waiting for laundry.
<Roleplay4life> 5It'd be early for me. /night owl
<baadf00d> I've turned into a night owl these past few uh
<baadf00d> months or years
<baadf00d> doesn't feel like years.
<baadf00d> so I wanna say months
<baadf00d> even though it's been like twenty of them.
<Roleplay4life> 5That's like a year and three-quarters. xD
<Hooh54> 4I'm a night owl too, I fall asleep around 4:00 am
<Roleplay4life> 5So you could say months.
<baadf00d> this past few relatively short time spans composed of thirty to sixty days.
<baadf00d> My usual bedtime is around 2:00
<Hooh54> 4Whoa
<Roleplay4life> 5Okay I'm not like EXTREME night owl like that. During the summer I go to bed around 2 AM and wake up around 9 AM.
<baadf00d> yesterday it was 4:30
<baadf00d> but that was a freakish occurrence.
<Roleplay4life> 5Once I stayed up until 3 AM finishing a paper. Uuugh. D|
<prince-dari> Hm, it's 4:43 am over here.
<Roleplay4life> 5Never procrastinated again lolol.
<baadf00d> Most days I need to do something in the morning though, I'm in bed by like 22:00 the night before.
<prince-dari> I'm procrastinating sleep because I have an exam tomorrow. :P
<Hooh54> 4Procrastination is evil
<prince-dari> Well, today.
<prince-dari> You know what I mean.
<Icydragon> 12lame
<baadf00d> Procrastination is the enemy of sleep.
<baadf00d> And I like sleep.
<Hooh54> 4^
<Roleplay4life> 5During the school year it's to bed around 11:30-midnight and up at 6-6:30 AM.
<Roleplay4life> 5But that was high school. xD
<baadf00d> lol high school
<Roleplay4life> 5I'll probably still go to bed around that same time though~
<baadf00d> I used to go to bed by like 20 or 21:00
<Roleplay4life> 5Provided whoever my dorm-mate is isn't a loud person... or someone who snores. /facepalm
<baadf00d> then I stopped doing that because it was lame
<Roleplay4life> 5I wish I could fall asleep that early lol..
<baadf00d> I used to be able to control my sleep hours. XD;
<Roleplay4life> 5I literally can't go to sleep earlier than 11 PM.
<baadf00d> then I stopped doing that because it was lame.
<Roleplay4life> 5It's nuts! I hate it! Especially if I have an early morning the next day!
<Hooh54> 4It takes me like an hour to fall asleep XD
<baadf00d> How fast I fall asleep depends on how f#d up my mind is at the time lol
<Roleplay4life> 5I have to read or write for at least half an hour or I'll be up all night THINKING oh man.
<baadf00d> If I had a normal day, it can take me a while to fall asleep
<baadf00d> but if I've been up for say
<Hooh54> 4._.
<baadf00d> eighteen hours straight
<baadf00d> working on code
<baadf00d> running solely on coffee and 5-hour energy
<baadf00d> then I can pass out in maybe thirteen to fifteen seconds.
<baadf00d> (not speaking from experience or anything)
<Roleplay4life> 5Once I went to bed at 11 PM and was up until 2-3 AM THINKING. Can you believe that? I practically planned a novel while trying to sleep. Of course I forgot it the next morning but ugh, why does inspiration hit when my head hits the pillow. xD
<Hooh54> 4I doze off when I'm bored, I just kind of fall asleep
<baadf00d> because inspiration is what pillows are made of.
<Roleplay4life> 5And then sometimes I then want to write down the idea but NOOO, then my eyes get tired and I can't write.
<baadf00d> Inspiration cleverly glazed onto a void which drains energy and willpower.
<Roleplay4life> 5So then I lay back down.. and bam. Insomnia. Too tired to write, to awake to sleep.
<baadf00d> that is why I sleep without a pillow.
<Roleplay4life> 5O__o;
<baadf00d> :P
<Roleplay4life> 5I couldn't do that. I have neck problems.
<baadf00d> I have more problems than just my neck lol
<baadf00d> my neck can gtfo
<baadf00d> sleep comes first.
<Roleplay4life> 5...I also have back problems? ^^;
<baadf00d> then sleep without a mattress.
<baadf00d> problem solved!
<Hooh54> 4I once woke up with my body half off of my bed, my neck felt horrible
<baadf00d> I once woke up stabbing at something off the side of my bed
<baadf00d> complete with pocketknife.
<baadf00d> It was weird.
<Hooh54> 4At least it wasn't yourself 0_0
<baadf00d> It woulda sucked if I was sleeping with my wife or something.
<baadf00d> That woulda been ugly.
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> You have a wife?
<baadf00d> yes, clearly
<Hooh54> 4You have a WIFE?
<Hooh54> 4Whoa, dude
<Roleplay4life> 5Why are you guys so shocked?
<prince-dari> Beat me to it.
<Roleplay4life> 5Arti's engaged.
<Roleplay4life> 5It's not that weird to think a member or two (or three or four) could be married.
<HyperMetalLugia> Well most TST users aren't that old, or old enough to even drink :p
<Hooh54> 4I'm far from being married
<prince-dari> Haha, American drinking age.
<HyperMetalLugia> 21 lol
<HyperMetalLugia> It is 18 here and in the UK
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<baadf00d> She doesn't like being stabbed with pocketknives and such.
<Hooh54> 4XD
<Icydragon> 12Gay marrige isn't legal here *sigh*
<Roleplay4life> 5I'm 18, I could get married... in Iowa. >__>
<baadf00d> America is stupiiiid
<SilverSonic> im 17 x-x
<Roleplay4life> 5Hey, now.

<Icydragon> 12I wanna get outta here before the apocolypse, It'll be hell then

<Hooh54> 4I don't ever want to drink, let's just start a new topic
<SilverSonic> Speak for yourself baadf00d you judged america earlier by calling it stupid
<SilverSonic> :P
<Manlyguy> I have no clue what to say to any of this.
<Icydragon> 12Getting drunk sucks, why would you want to do it,.
<baadf00d> inorite
<Hooh54> 4Contradicting yourself, much XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Odd

<baadf00d> because I am american.
<SilverSonic> No You arent
<Hooh54> 4I'm allowed to divide by zero
<Icydragon> 12I'm american

<Hooh54> 4And I'm not afraid to do it
<baadf00d> Quite.

<baadf00d> not in front of the kittens
<baadf00d> :(
<Manlyguy> Kittens are naked, too.
<HyperMetalLugia> They have fur
<baadf00d> being naked in the presence of other naked things
<HyperMetalLugia> Which covers them up XD
<baadf00d> is just weird.
<Icydragon> 12Intresting...
<Manlyguy> Hmmm, good point.
<Manlyguy> Maybe just one of us should get naked, in that case.
<Hooh54> 4OH U
<Manlyguy> And get rid of the kittens.
<baadf00d> That will work.
<baadf00d> I vote not me.
<baadf00d> :D
<SilverSonic> o_O
<Hooh54> 4The fact of getting naked in front of people is creepy
<SilverSonic> ok, can we please move on to a topic that is appropriate
<SilverSonic> please?
<baadf00d> It's only creepy if more than one person does it.
<Hooh54> 4Birds
<Hooh54> 4KITTENS
<Manlyguy> are naked
<baadf00d> BIRDS EVERYWHERE.
<Hooh54> 4BURDSSS

<Hooh54> 4Lol
<baadf00d> I found out just the other day what cosmopolitan means.
<HyperMetalLugia> Kittens kill birds
<Manlyguy> Now everyone is off to google it.
<Hooh54> 4Except me
<Hooh54> 4I'm too scared
<baadf00d> *achievement unlocked*

<Hooh54> 4Ponies
<baadf00d> cosmopolitan is obviously an innuendo.

<baadf00d> see what I did there.
<Hooh54> 4Nay
<SilverSonic> No we didnt see, and we didnt care :P

<prince-dari> So I guess the first thing you're wondering is why? Well. It's awesome. It's awesome. It's awesome. It's awesome. It's awesome. It's awesome. It's awesome.
<HyperMetalLugia> Regular physics are good enough
<prince-dari> "And I guess because it's awesome?"
<prince-dari> No, you can't just assume things, and because the animation is fantastic.
<SilverSonic> Anime? MLP an anime?!
<SilverSonic> wut
<lightumbreon> oh my dear lord
<lightumbreon> we're all going to hell, aren't we?!

<Nick> I had a feeling it wouldn't live up to the hype but damn it absoloutley bombed in the critical reviews!
<Chimera> 04[15:05:58] <May> 14you're made of dark matter
<lightumbreon> it did go wel
<Chimera> 04yum
<Chimera> 04It did?
<HyperMetalLugia> We can't touch you :P
<Chimera> 04Nick it did?
<Chimera> 04Dang.
<Chimera> 04I thought that it was suppose to be "the game" everyone was waiting for (Duke Nukem fans that is)
<lightumbreon> it worked out well, graphics, gameplay
<lightumbreon> better than frigging Call Of Duty
<Chimera> 04prolly
<SilverSonic> EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ACTIVISION
<Nick> >.> why must everyone compare games nowadays to COD?
<lightumbreon> it has the 5 B's :3
<lightumbreon> Bullets, Bombs Beer Babes
<lightumbreon> and...
<lightumbreon> erm
<SilverSonic> BEWBSA
<Nick> ok here's a fact: did you know the original COD won over 80 GOTY awards and 50 editors choice awards in 2003?
<lightumbreon> YES
<SilverSonic> -A
<lightumbreon> yes nick, it did
<lightumbreon> overrated >:
<lightumbreon> i hate it when people brag about their kill streak
<SilverSonic> ^
<HyperMetalLugia> Including Halulzers
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew Halo
<SilverSonic> CoD and DNF are forever crap games.
<prince-dari> After playing CoD for a certain amount of time all anyone ever does it do quickscopes.
<Nick> DNF was way overrated, in the reviews anyways
<SilverSonic> As well as halo
<lightumbreon> then i go, MINE ISH BETTAR BECAUSE I PLAY MORE GAMES THAN YOU DRUNKS
*SilverSonic runs
<lightumbreon> halo one was good, then they were going bad
<HyperMetalLugia> lool
<lightumbreon> and from bad to shitshy
<HyperMetalLugia> All Halos are bad :P
<HyperMetalLugia> WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR RANK?!
<lightumbreon> Halo one is classic
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<lightumbreon> not the best game, but playable
<lightumbreon> halo one doesn't do ranks HAH
<Espeon> 06<prince-dari> After playing CoD for a certain amount of time all anyone ever does it do quickscopes.
<lightumbreon> thats why i do it
<Espeon> 06The most fun I've had in CoD for years is
<prince-dari> I know.
<Espeon> 06messing with the people who do that
<Espeon> 06xD
<lightumbreon> killing nazi'x
<prince-dari> Messing with them how?
<Damos> hello
<SilverSonic> Who cares about HALO and CoD
<lightumbreon> fun thing about CoD is the first two, killing nazi's
*SilverSonic hides
<Espeon> 06By not quickscoping? Using any of the other guns in the game gives them a headache and makes them very mad even
<Espeon> 06I dunno why
<prince-dari> Nah.
<SilverSonic> !espeon
*Espeon now belongs to SilverSonic for 20 minutes
<prince-dari> If they're any good they'd still kill you.
<Nick> actually don't forget United offensive the EXP pack for COD1
<Nick> best multiplayer COD I ever played
<lightumbreon> then kicked for Tea-Bagging and botting
<Espeon> 06Well 9/10 quickscopers are the ones trying to imitate the good ones :P
<lightumbreon> and YESH COD:UO, best CoD in the whole libary of them :3
<Espeon> 6la~ (SilverSonic)
<Espeon> 06and it's hilarious seeing them going to Battlefield and going WHY ISN'T THE SNIPER 1 SHOT KILL???
<lightumbreon> cheaters....
<prince-dari> I wouldn't say so, most of my friends and their friends were pretty good.
<lightumbreon> go old skool
<Nick> so you actually admit one COD was good lu? :3
<Nick> *runs*
<lightumbreon> Unreal Tournament made frigging Deathmatch
<lightumbreon> PLAYABLE
<prince-dari> Hm, I've never played battlefield.
<lightumbreon> yes Nick, the first one was good, the second CoD was playable, the rest is crap
<Nick> worst ideas for MP online ever: GTA 4 and SR2
<lightumbreon> ^
<prince-dari> Best games I've played in a while are RDR and GT5.
<lightumbreon> don't forget the rest of GTA
<Nick> god I hated SR2 online.
<prince-dari> Black Ops was meh.
<lightumbreon> black sheep of the fammily ;3
<lightumbreon> best games for me were proberly older ones
<Nick> do you ever played that friend who got the powerful gun and just camped there protecting it to prevent anyone else from getting it?
<Espeon> 06well dari I don't blame those who know how to do the whole quickscoping stuff staying with other people who know how to do it LOL. Point it, bad quickscopers = free kills
<Espeon> 06End of
*Espeon flops
<Nick> thats what SR2 MP was about, someone guarding the only entrance up a building to a rocket launcher, using, a rocket launcher
<Nick> anyone who came up was guaranteed to die
<lightumbreon> Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Diablo 2, Doom, and for newer ones, go Starcraft 2 and Anno 1404
<prince-dari> Hahaha, well the only way to get good at them is practice, so there are bound to be bad people trying.
<lightumbreon> ^
<lightumbreon> don't forget those DAmn trolls who keep challenginf you on MP, god i hate them
<Espeon> 06Of course but I'm mostly talking about the stereotypical
<Espeon> 06"montage kiddies"
<lightumbreon> "montage kitties"
<lightumbreon> better
<Espeon> 6I hate CoD (SilverSonic)
*SilverSonic runs
<prince-dari> Some of the MW2 hacks are awesome, there are some really good zombie mods.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> We know ;p
<Espeon> 06But then again, I'd rather go against even good quickscopers than someone doing some other "creative" trick. Like one man army / danger close
<HyperMetalLugia> Zombies, oh lawdy
<lightumbreon> ZOMBIES!
<lightumbreon> GET OUT THA SHOTGUNZ!
<Espeon> 06And lol yeah, mods
<Espeon> 06:3
<lightumbreon> some mods i played screwed up my games
<lightumbreon> badly
<lightumbreon> like some for C&C Generals:Zero Hour
<prince-dari> LOL, most fun you can have on CoD is go camp on rust with 1man army/danger close and a noob tube, then get a nuke and listen to the people on the other team afterwards.
<prince-dari> They got so annoyed.
<prince-dari> On MW2 I mean.
<lightumbreon> i know right?
<lightumbreon> xD
<Espeon> 06See, that's what I'm talking about
<Umbreon> 12Espeon~
<Nick> yeah MW2 nukes >.> what were IW thinking?
<Espeon> 06HEY GUYS LETS REWARD PEOPLE FOR CAMPING SPAWN IN OBJECTIVE GAMES AND LET THEM WIN THE GAME
<Espeon> 06GENIUS
<Nick> anyways you people wanna know a great MP game? World in Conflict
<Zoroark> hi
<Nick> thoroughly, thoroughly brilliant, shame there was so little interest in the game :|
<lightumbreon> good MP and Sp would be Company of Heroe
<lightumbreon> *Heros
<lightumbreon> *Heroes
<Nick> o.o
<Nick> omg yes
<lightumbreon> i just got the trilogy complete :P
<Nick> COH brilliant, although I was never good at the base building RTS MP games
<lightumbreon> it really like the option to actually play as the Nazi's
<Nick> which is why WiC was better for me
<prince-dari> I'm just remembering star wars battlefront from PS2, that game was epic.
<lightumbreon> everyone want the BEST FPS EVER?
<lightumbreon> Doom
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> Always with doom.
<lightumbreon> they did it right the first time
<lightumbreon> yes
<Espeon> 06battlefront
<Nick> Goldeneye
<Espeon> 06was tons of fun
<lightumbreon> when people brag about bad graphics i'll yell at them
<Nick> and MOH: Allied Assault
<lightumbreon> IF DOOM WASN'T MADE< YOUR SILLY CoD WAS A FFING SIDESCROLLER!
<Nick> and COD 1 *runs from flamethrowing )
<prince-dari> Why do people rave about Goldeneye?
<lightumbreon> TRY SNIPING THAT!
<lightumbreon> xD
<Nick> actually wasn't wolfenstein before doom?
<Espeon> 06lol, sidescroller
<Espeon> 06gang garrison up in this
<lightumbreon> yes Wolf3D was before doom
<lightumbreon> also from ID Games
<Nick> also Goldeneye was great because it was a movie tie in that is actually considered one of the greatest games of all time
<lightumbreon> but DOOM brake the cycle better, and did it right
<Nick> no other movie tie in can say that
<lightumbreon> i never played golden eye, but i really want to try it
<prince-dari> Isn't goldeneye getting a remake?
<Nick> its already out dari
<prince-dari> Oh.
<prince-dari> Does it not live up to the original then? I haven't heard anything about the remake other than that it was being made sometime.
*lightumbreon stops ranting now
<lightumbreon> Goodnight all

<Aeroslash> hi guys ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't know if my RAID array is being slow or what

<drfsupercenter> 03see that drive Y LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<drfsupercenter> 03but files are going like
<drfsupercenter> 032MB/sec
<drfsupercenter> 03to it
<drfsupercenter> 03that's really really slow
<HyperMetalLugia> Slow
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<HyperMetalLugia> And wait
<drfsupercenter> 03at this rate it'll take s3everal years to transfer 2TB
<HyperMetalLugia> One drive
<HyperMetalLugia> Or RAID :P
<drfsupercenter> 03RAID.
<HyperMetalLugia> SLOW RAID wat
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I just said RAID array
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't know
<drfsupercenter> 03it still says "initializing"
<drfsupercenter> 03whatever that means
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> I think each drive needs its own love
<HyperMetalLugia> Or in other words, the RAID controller is having a hard time
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe it was too cheap
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<drfsupercenter> 03dude
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a $200 motherboard
<drfsupercenter> 03with the RAId built in
<drfsupercenter> 03I got a new CPU too

<HyperMetalLugia> Overkill
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> I'll be using that much
<HyperMetalLugia> In...10 years?
<HyperMetalLugia> So is DRF going to waste time bragging about money spent on his PC which could of been spent on LL?"
*HyperMetalLugia flees
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03dude
<drfsupercenter> 03I tried to spend money on her
<drfsupercenter> 03she won't let me
<drfsupercenter> 03she's all
<drfsupercenter> 03You've spent enough on me, I feel guilty
<HyperMetalLugia> I have?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like, good, then help me get achievements and we'll be even
*drfsupercenter runs
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Which socket is your Core i7?
<drfsupercenter> 031366
<drfsupercenter> 03see
<drfsupercenter> 03basically here's what happened
<drfsupercenter> 03my older one was 1156
<HyperMetalLugia> Bah, never getting that :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Can I have it?
<drfsupercenter> 03and I was trying to find a good motherboard
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<drfsupercenter> 03since the MSI I had only had one PCI express x16 slot
<drfsupercenter> 03well, it's really really really hard to find good 1156 motherboards, since that socket has been discontinued
<drfsupercenter> 03it ended up being cheaper to just get a new processor LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not even kidding
<drfsupercenter> 03it was only like $160
<drfsupercenter> 03for this
<drfsupercenter> 03(the CPU)
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow
<drfsupercenter> 03my older i7 was $100 more
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03the motherboard was another $150 or so
<HyperMetalLugia> Crazy deflation
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03but good 1156 motherboards were well over $300
<drfsupercenter> 03so it works out XD
<drfsupercenter> 03and as for you having it... it would cost me a fortune to send it to bermuda
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a friend in America who wants it
<HyperMetalLugia> I know, and I have a Mini-tower
<HyperMetalLugia> So I don't even know what Mobo would fit XD
<drfsupercenter> 03my motherboard is full ATX
<HyperMetalLugia> I haven't checked the specs in ages
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf
<drfsupercenter> 03this new i7 has the same Windows performace score as my old i7
<drfsupercenter> 03despite it being almost .5GHz faster
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm :P
<drfsupercenter> 03that was 2.8, this is 3.24
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 overclock
<HyperMetalLugia> Nah
<drfsupercenter> 03oh, I'm using liquid cooling now.
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm using fans
<HyperMetalLugia> Forever fan
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03I was
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03the fans are fricking heavy
<drfsupercenter> 03and get all dusty
<drfsupercenter> 03and my friend found me this decent liquid cooler that you don't have to worry about
<drfsupercenter> 03it comes pre-setup
<drfsupercenter> 03you just screw it in place and you're done
<drfsupercenter> 03:D
<HyperMetalLugia> For the stuff I do on my PC, I could run it without a fan ;p
<HyperMetalLugia> Since I'm living off of my laptop now LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> See, my PC is just for storage
<HyperMetalLugia> Now I might buy myself a wireless N router
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Credit
<HyperMetalLugia> And hmm, the Core i7 860 turbo is the same as the i7-960 O.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Yet that half GHZ difference
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<drfsupercenter> 03my CPU was not turbo
<Creideiki> Hello HML
<HyperMetalLugia> I know, but the Intel site XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Odd thing
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03the main difference with the 960 is it's triple channekl
<drfsupercenter> 03-k
<drfsupercenter> 03but 24GB of RAM ;o
<HyperMetalLugia> IKR?
<HyperMetalLugia> 3GB forever :>
<Creideiki> Hilariously, a friend of mine has been given a chance at owning a hilarious, and pretty awesome computer.
<HyperMetalLugia> What is it like? LO
<HyperMetalLugia> 3RAM: Used: 1239/1908MB
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<Creideiki> ...IBM Z/System mainframe.
<Creideiki> It's about three years old. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Room sized :o
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Creideiki> 4 cabinets actually.
<Creideiki> And... I believe about 128G of RAM. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Can it run Crysis?
<HyperMetalLugia> Needs Windows 7 Ultimate/server
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Creideiki> Install z/VM, and stick a few Winderp clients in.
<Creideiki> And yes.
<Creideiki> It can run Crysis.
<Creideiki> About 32 at the same time. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Fun :p
<HyperMetalLugia> Does it cost a billion dollars?
<Creideiki> It also has I think about 100T of disk. :P
<Creideiki> (Mmm... DASD.)
<HyperMetalLugia> (What)
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03100TB?
<HyperMetalLugia> He needs that PC
<HyperMetalLugia> YES
<Creideiki> (DASD = Direct Access Storage Device :: IBM for hard drive.)
<HyperMetalLugia> 100T O>>o
<HyperMetalLugia> TB
<Creideiki> 100T as in 100 TB.
<HyperMetalLugia> Whoa
<Creideiki> And again, look at the RAM.
<Creideiki> 128GB
<Creideiki> The system cost I believe 10 mil.
*Espeon returns.
<HyperMetalLugia> Every PC feels sad now
<HyperMetalLugia> WB Espeon
<Skylands> 10Wb Xeli
<Espeon> 06And now I wonder how he has gotten the chance to own something like that
<Creideiki> They're scrapping it for a bunch of Winderp clusters.
<HyperMetalLugia> Good
<Creideiki> (Congratulations <company> you're full of dumb.)
<Espeon> 06Lol
<HyperMetalLugia> At least there can be more USE put to them :D
<Creideiki> ...You know the z/10 can run Windows ontop of a goodly hypervisor.
<Creideiki> And you'll actually have uptime that's longer then an hour. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03so Creideiki can I get this 100TB disk storage system for free?
*drfsupercenter runs
<HyperMetalLugia> My longest uptime was around 5 days lol
<HyperMetalLugia> 3Uptime: 3 hours 39 minutes 38 seconds
<HyperMetalLugia> Creideiki is full of Linux bias
<Creideiki> drf: Do you have space for two full height 19" racks? ...And a massive HVAC system. ...And three phase power? :P
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<Creideiki> Linux is blegh.
<Creideiki> I prefer BSD. :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Same difference
<Creideiki> Which is less "Apply head to wall."
<drfsupercenter> 03Creideiki, can I just have the hard drives?
*drfsupercenter hides
<HyperMetalLugia> Have fun with hospitals and head dents
<HyperMetalLugia> BBS
<Creideiki> drf: The racks are FULL of hard drives.
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03nice
<Creideiki> And not nice SATA.
<drfsupercenter> 03but only 19"? I could make it fit
<drfsupercenter> 03what is it then, SCSI?
<Creideiki> Either FICON or ESCON.
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03never heard of it
<Creideiki> Welcome to the world of mainframe technology.
<Creideiki> Or "I have more storage then I will EVER BLEEPING NEED." :P
<drfsupercenter> 03i just want massive storage XD
<drfsupercenter> 03dude no way
<drfsupercenter> 03I could fill up 100TB
<Creideiki> With what?
<drfsupercenter> 03I record so many TV shows that it's insane
<drfsupercenter> 03TV recordings/
<drfsupercenter> 03HDTV is huge
<drfsupercenter> 03like 10GB a movie
<Creideiki> That which makes up 90% of the internet?
<Creideiki> (Starts with a p, ends with an n. Is four letters. :P )
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03maaaybe
<Creideiki> "So, what does <company> do with their 100T of storage?" "Well, about 75% is various databases, mostly accounting and project files. Another 10% is the user files. The last 5% is various system critical components." "You left out 10%!" "Oh yeah... that's full of... we'll call it 'data.'"
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Sparky> o3o
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<Nick> "Graphics and Mechanics are 50% at least for the game to be good and another 50% for gameplay,story line and characters. People who say GFX and Mechs are not important should STFU and play their 20 years old nes games because they're not true gamers,they're retards in the gaming community"
<Nick> wow that comment on IGN made me laugh so hard
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol, tards
<HyperMetalLugia> Well they just don't know quality
<HyperMetalLugia> Or real toughness
<Nick> basically it sounds like he's saying video games are all about the graphics, story and characters make good video games nowadays, not actual playable games
<HyperMetalLugia> So if I have this amazing cube which loooks sooo realistic and doesn't move, it is a good game?
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow
<Nick> so I guess because I have my NES and been playing that more means I'm a retard, because the video games I played back then aren't significant to video games as a whole today
<Nick> and HML so true
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes, because Immobile cube > Mario Bros
<HyperMetalLugia> And if it has OMG 3D, the more brownie points
<Nick> whats the name of that dancing game again that came out on WII's launch
<HyperMetalLugia> Just Dance?
<Nick> yes
<Skylands|Idle> 10My little sister loves that game </random>
<Nick> LAWL THIS GAME IS BETTER THAN ZELDA II OR STARFOX COS YOU KNOW IT HAS BETTER GRAPHICS AND MOTION CONTROLLS

*Espeon rolls
<Nick> lol espy xD
<Nick> also another comment someone made about all the small house devs being bought out by big companies, so true really.
<Nick> The video game crash came about there being too much competition and products for sale beign released by too many companies making too many bad games
<Nick> now its too little companies releasing too many games that are the same
<Nick> like Transformers War for Cybertron was great, but it really was a GoW clone totally
*Roleplay4life 5waves to people~
<Skylands> 10Hi RP4L :3

<Altair> Damn
<jamie> I got to do a bit more work but yeah after this, JR will be even more popular
<jamie> :P

<Archfiend> I was looking for redundant CSS that directed to the images directory
<Archfiend> It could also be an issue with the server directory permissions
<Archfiend> because something fucked up when the server moved

<Chimera> 04well the thing is
<Chimera> 04it uses external files for music
<Chimera> 04so :/
<Quanyails> 7Remove it when you send it there? :P
<Chimera> 04I need to find a server so I can upload files to there..
<Chimera> 04yeah that makes it look crappy
<prince-dari> Pretty sure you can store the music files inside the fla.
<Archfiend> ohai Caaz
<prince-dari> So they're in the SWF when you publish it.
<Chimera> 04yes but as I recall that makes it lag like all hell
<Chimera> 04And if it doesn't lag it sounds like crap.
<prince-dari> Surely lag time from loading it externally would be worse?
<Caaz> Hi.
<Chimera> 04What's a good compression format for audio that isn't slow but at the same time isn't crappy?
<Chimera> 04um
<HyperMetalLugia> .ogg?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<Chimera> 04you do know the external file loading is instantanious |D
<Chimera> 04hm
<Chimera> 04good idea
<Quanyails> 7MIDI. :3
<prince-dari> When the file is local.
<Chimera> 04lemme try that
*Quanyails 7flees.
<Chimera> 04rofl
<Chimera> 04yeah I know
*Chimera starts making OOGs
<prince-dari> Not if it's loaded over the internet, which was more what I meant.
<HyperMetalLugia> MIDI FTW

<Chimera> 04prince-dari
<Chimera> 04What compression should I use?
<HyperMetalLugia> Does Chimera need BW Midis?
<Chimera> 04MP3 makes it slow
<Chimera> 04no I don't
<Archfiend> ;o
<HyperMetalLugia> Silly OGG :P
<HyperMetalLugia> What bitrates are there
*Quanyails 7finished another fakemon description.

<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Chimera> 048bit, 16bit, 32bit, etx
<Chimera> 04*etc
<prince-dari> To be honest I don't know that much about music file types/compressions.
<HyperMetalLugia> 16 is decent
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<Chimera> 04and apparently there's a 8kHz sample rate
<Sneas> Ns look at other chans.
<Archfiend> SNEAS
<HyperMetalLugia> That is...kinda terrible
<Chimera> 04Should I do that?
<Chimera> 04k
<Chimera> 04:P
<Chimera> 04erm
<Chimera> 04that's an option for rate
*Hooh54 4is listening to the Okami soundtrack while people chat
<prince-dari> I'd start with a lower quality version, then keep trying higher quality each time until you get a level of compromise.
<prince-dari> Between lag and quality.
<Chimera> 04ugh
<Chimera> 04yeah I know
<Chimera> 04but
<Chimera> 04eww
<HyperMetalLugia> Start with 64KBPS, then go to 96 :P
*Ray is listening to Kagefumi Etranger ~ Hatsune Miku

<Hooh54> 4*chirp*
<HyperMetalLugia> What encoder/program are you using?
<Chimera> 04Flash CS5?
<HyperMetalLugia> There normally is a option for Stereo and your bits o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Odd, and I don't have Flash CS5 to add to this confusion :P
<prince-dari> I don't know why it would lag though, most flash games have music embedded and they don't lag.
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe they use MIDIs :P
<HyperMetalLugia> But yeah, I shouldn't worry about lag
<HyperMetalLugia> Unless you have a terrible PC, or slow internet
<Ray> 02aka: me
<Hooh54> 4And me
<prince-dari> Slow internet wouldn't matter if the music is embedded.
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm, seems the .ogg at 64KBPS is just a bit smaller than the MP3 @ 64 for a 2min song
<HyperMetalLugia> http://kotaku.com/5811558/
<HyperMetalLugia> But the MP3 is slightly louder
<HyperMetalLugia> So odd
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, OGG is better sounding
<HyperMetalLugia> The drums are clearer XD
<Astray> sup people
<Astray> who was the one I had to teach how to stream?

<Chimera> 04...Soundbooth doesn't convert to OOG.
<HyperMetalLugia> And you can't import?
<HyperMetalLugia> Or export, however you got the music into there
<DubstepMaster> hello

<HyperMetalLugia> What idea?
<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
*Light_Latias shuts off Alan Wake until morning .-.
<Chimera> 04I'm going to start at 112 kHz
<Chimera> 04and go down until I hit crap
<Chimera> 04and use the one before that |D
<Chimera> 04btw
<Chimera> 04prince-dari, is there a way for me to actionscript a sound to play?
<Chimera> 04An embedded sound that is.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Chimera> 04tell please c:
<Hooh54> 4I'm rather confused atm
<Chimera> 04you don't need to know what goes on here
<Chimera> 04|d
<Chimera> 04*|D
*Chimera waits for the great Prince's answer
*Chimera shot
<prince-dari> Well you put the sound file in your library, then change its properties, checking "Export for AS at frame 1", and give it a name to use for AS.
<Chimera> 04ah
<Chimera> 04nice
<Astray> sup
<prince-dari> Then you'd load it with AS like this.
<Astray> so, who're the ones who wanted to learn how to STREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAM?
<Chimera> 04k
<prince-dari> var whatever:nameYouGave = new nameYouGave();
<prince-dari> whatever.play();
<Chimera> 04so
<DubstepMaster> i would like to learn how to streem
<Hooh54> 4I'm guessing it is about someone here who has Flash trouble *hides*
<Chimera> 04var BGM:music = new music(); || BGM.play(); ?
<prince-dari> Then yeah, you place BGM.play(); where you want it to start.
<prince-dari> You can tell it whether to loop (I think) or not and how far into the sound to play as well, and stuff like that.
<Chimera> 04o_O
<Chimera> 04so
<Chimera> 04can I tell it WHEN to loop?
<Chimera> 04Like, when it hits the end loop at *insert time*?
<prince-dari> Hmm, I don't think that's a built in function of the class, but you could write an extension of it, or find some other way to do it.
<Chimera> 04or something
<Chimera> 04|D
<Chimera> 04Looping music is the least of my worries right now
<prince-dari> Lol, you don't even need to change the sound type outside of flash.
<prince-dari> You can do it inside.
<Chimera> 04k
<prince-dari> In properties, you can change the compression, default, ADPCM, MP3, raw, speech, and change the quality/bit rate.
<Chimera> 04yes I know
<prince-dari> Oh, and in regards to your question about looping, if you know the point you want it to loop at you can just use an if statement in an enter frame function.
<Astray> DCD told me something about some people he had to meet here
<Astray> oh well

<Iskierka> moo.
<Ascendant> ohai
<Iskierka> haidere
<Ascendant> ;p
<Ascendant> blah
<Ascendant> can't think of a method to use for the !pokemon script system
<Iskierka> ?
<Ascendant> in relations to the new !setgen script
<Ascendant> !setgen5
<ScriptBot> Syntax: !setgen5 [on|off|status] [nick] (Only moderators can turn gen5 on for nicks other than their own, normal users, or mods who wish to use it for their own nick, just use !setgen5 [on|off|status].)
<Ascendant> it uses readini/writeini to write to a file under a nick's name
<Ascendant> like, gen5=on, gen4=off, etc.
<Ascendant> and all the pokemon are separated into different files depending on their generation
<Iskierka> five .txt files, poke1 poke2 etc, pick random valid number and read [ poke $+ %pokenum $+ .txt ]
<Iskierka> ?
<Ascendant> as in, pokemongen5.txt
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> my brain is fuzzling atm
<Ascendant> how do I get it to choose a number from the ones that are valid though?
<Iskierka> you'd usually use a while statement, letme check what comparisons can be used
<Ascendant> ah right
<Ascendant> I doubt $rand would work
<eXAKR> You need to plug in limits
<Iskierka> hmm, there might be something but it's gonna require something odd
<Iskierka> wouldn't be too difficult if $rand could be used with binary, doubt that's possible though
<Ascendant> don't think so
<Ascendant> could use $rand(1,3) and get it to substitute the numbers
<Ascendant> but that's a very long system
<Ascendant> and it's icky
<Iskierka> would be awkward too
<Ascendant> yeah
<Iskierka> and let's avoid a goto ...
<Ascendant> noooooooooo
<Ascendant> not gotos ;x
<Iskierka> don't want raptors attacking the bot's host machine
<Ascendant> :x
<Iskierka> aaaah wait
<Iskierka> if you can convert the list of allowed gens to their numbers
<Iskierka> then I'll need to test how while (v1 & v2) works but I think it can be done
<Ascendant> huh?
<Iskierka> how to explain
<Iskierka> er
<Ascendant> :x
<Iskierka> have five variables, and if the gen that variable represents is disabled, set it to zero
<Archfiend> ohai jamie ;o
<Iskierka> hmm, will that work ...
<Iskierka> this is damn difficult to figure out
<jamie> hey
<jamie> whats up?
<Iskierka> I say do that, yes.
<Iskierka> and if the gen is enabled, set it to the number of the gen
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> a shame $or only allows 2 chars
<Ascendant> parameters*
<Archfiend> nothing much
<eXAKR> Try something else?
<Iskierka> a pity, yes
<Ascendant> I could possibly rescript the system
<Ascendant> if I can think of a better one
<Ascendant> or I could do the long, boring and tedious way
<Ascendant> and write up over 9000 if/elseifs
<Ascendant> for every single combination
<lightumbreon> that would take a long time
<Iskierka> yes it would
<Iskierka> and slight correction, just have the variables equal to 1 if they're on, not equal to the gen
<Iskierka> will work better this way, I think
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Iskierka> (I'm still working on a method)
<Ascendant> true
<Ascendant> yeah I'm trying to think of one as well ;x
<Iskierka> I miiight be close but this is weird and needs a lot of testing
<Ascendant> Hm, does isnum allow several parameters?
<Ascendant> I only ever use if ($2 isnum) { or something
<Iskierka> hmm, I'm not sure, I don't think it'll work though
<Ascendant> Hm
<Iskierka> this next bit is getting weird, store a temporary variable that is $calc( 2^1 ( %gen1 ) + ... + 2^5 ( %gen5 ) ) ( obv fill in the ... with the other gens )
<Iskierka> er,
<Ascendant> I was wondering whether $calc could work ;x
<Iskierka> $calc( 2^1 * ( %gen1 ) + ... + 2^5 * ( %gen5 ) ) <-- remember to multiply
<Ascendant> But I'm not too sure of any calculations
<Ascendant> Ah
<Iskierka> then, have a while statement of: while (%randresult !& %thattempvarwiththeweirdcalculation) {
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> Well, the easiest and probably simplest way would be using goto
<Ascendant> but goto is ;x
<Iskierka> and in there, %randres = $rand(1,5)
<Ascendant> hm
<Iskierka> then %randresult = $calc( 2 ^ %randres )
<Iskierka> and that -should- do it, weird as it is
<Iskierka> either unset %randresult or set it to zero after the while, or before it
<Drake> 04back
<Iskierka> else it'll get stuck on a particular gen
<Drake> 04o-o
<Ascendant> hm true
<Iskierka> and yes, I know this is weird, but the & is the most useful statement here and all that's needed to get it into a form that it can be used for
<Ascendant> heh, my brain hurts already
<Iskierka> well actually, you could use lots of $biton and $bitoff statements, but I think that'd be even longer
<Ascendant> I've never used those
<Iskierka> :p be glad you didn't have to think the system up
<Iskierka> and yeah, they don't look that useful
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> I'm just like "wat"
<Ascendant> also, set -uNUMBER is pretty damn useful
<Iskierka> yep
<Iskierka> and let's give an explanation, first statement gets us a number that, in binary, if we want 1,3 and 4, will be 011010 (there's an extra zero, sue me for being too lazy to use a -1). 1 2 5 would be 100110, first gens at the end of the list
<Iskierka> %randres is obviously just generating a random number to be the gen number
<Ascendant> ...yeah, I suck at binary
<Iskierka> and %randresult is doing the same conversion to that that I did with the gens
<Ascendant> heh
<Iskierka> while (%randresult !& %thattempvarwiththeweirdcalculation) <-- this is then seeing is %randresult matches any of the allowed gens, by seeing if any of the binary digits match
<Iskierka> *if
<Ascendant> hm
<Iskierka> if they do match, the while's comparison = 0, and it then breaks out of the while loop
<Iskierka> if not, back in for a new number
<Iskierka> not exactly simple, but I blame mIRC for forcing either the long way, or the complicated way
<Ascendant> mIRC isn't very flexible
<Iskierka> nope, not at all
<Iskierka> in python, I could create a list of allowed gens from a set of variables in two lines, and pick a number from that list with only one more
<Iskierka> well, from a set of variables stored in a file, at least
<Iskierka> but in python I'd probably already be doing it with a list, so I wouldn't need to create it
<Ascendant> Actually, I think I might know a simpler system...to basically get mIRC to /set %insertrandomvarhere %blah1 $+ %blah2 $+ %blah3 with blah being the numbers, then for it to do $rand(1,$len(%insertrandomvarhere)))
<Iskierka> hmm
<Ascendant> and then to select the character
<Iskierka> is there a way to pick out the character like that?
<Ascendant> I think so
<Iskierka> never tried that sort of thing in mIRC
<Ascendant> I remember there was one $ thing
*Ascendant checks
<Iskierka> hm
<Iskierka> ah, $mid might work
<Iskierka> (despite not looking like one that would do this)
<Iskierka> though
<Iskierka> how do you stop them from being included if they're not part?
<Iskierka> (The numbers)
<Ascendant> I'm pretty sure there is a way
<Ascendant> I just can't remember it
<Ascendant> because I've used it before
<Iskierka> still have that script you used it in?
<Ascendant> probably, but I'm not sure where I would have put it
<Ascendant> and $mid would probably work
<Ascendant> $mid(%var,%selectedcharvar,1)
<Iskierka> yes, that should work, if you can make the list properly
<Ascendant> list?
<Iskierka> %var
<Iskierka> the string
<Iskierka> or whatever, of the allowed gens
<Archfiend> wb
<Ascendant> that's easy
<Ascendant> -> /set %insertrandomvarhere %blah1 $+ %blah2 $+ %blah3
<Ascendant> at least I think that works
<Ascendant> if not then use an alias to handle it
<Iskierka> and what string would that produce if it was say, 1,3,4 allowed?
<Ascendant> well it's be 134
<Ascendant> and then $rand(1,$len(%insertrandomvarhere))) would turn out $rand(1,3)
<Ascendant> and then $mid(%var,%selectedcharvar,1) would turn out as $mid(134,number,1)
<Iskierka> but then you need a method of skipping the disallowed gens, which I would assume are set to zero
<Iskierka> without that skipping you'd have 10340
<Ascendant> well
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<Ascendant> while ($readini(genlist.ini,$nick,gen $+ $2) == on) && (%gennumber < 5) { set %gen [ $+ [ $2 ] ] [ $+ [ $nick ] ] $2 }
<eXAKR> What the heck is OneNote
<Ascendant> onenote is pretty cool
<Ascendant> basically it's a free-writing word thing
<eXAKR> Hmmm.
<Ascendant> you can type anywhere on it
<Ascendant> without needing to hit enter etc.
<Iskierka> er
<Ascendant> not sure about the format of the set %gen etc. bit @ Iskierka, but that bit should be that hard ;x
<Ascendant> shouldn't*
<Iskierka> that's an ... unusual script.
<Ascendant> xD
<eXAKR> hmmm
<Iskierka> just trying to decrypt it
<Ascendant> oh wait
<Ascendant> I think it'd be
<Ascendant> while (%gennumber < 5) { if ($readini(genlist.ini,$nick,gen $+ $2) == on) { set %gen etc. stuff $2 | inc %gennumber } else { inc %gennumber } }
<Ascendant> that sounds just about right ;x
<Iskierka> hm
<Ascendant> oh man, mIRC always makes things more complicated than they should be >:
<Iskierka> I think while %gennum =< 5, but other than that ...
<Iskierka> what's the context of this while statement, where are you using it? ( like what on *: statement triggered it?)
<Iskierka> I'm mainly trying to identify what $2 will be
<Ascendant> er sec
<Ascendant> I'll paste you the script
<Iskierka> alright
<Ascendant> ignore the !pokemon script
<Ascendant> just look at the !setgen5 one
<Ascendant> er
<Ascendant> !setgen*
<Ascendant> it's quite messy
<Ascendant> lmfao we've been at this for an hour
<Iskierka> I'm really not sure but I can't help but think $2 should be %gennumber in that script
<Iskierka> or that part of it
<Ascendant> well, wouldn't the script be going off !pokemon?
<Ascendant> and !pokemon is just !pokemon, not !pokemon gen5 or something
<Ascendant> so it'd be doing $readini(genlist.ini,$nick,gen1) and cycling through all those
<Ascendant> actually
<Ascendant> yes :x
<Iskierka> :p
<Ascendant> yeah you're right, sorry, I thought you meant something else
<Ascendant> XD
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Ascendant> the $2 was kinda just an example because I was too lazy to think of the real thing ;x
<Iskierka> this script is confusing, and I wouldn't fancy being the one to make it from scratch in mIRC
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Ascendant> trust me, it's not the most confusing I've done
<Ascendant> it's more messy than anything though
<Ascendant> that's probably why it's confusing
<Iskierka> like I said, python, sure, you can do all sorts of fun things with lists to make things like this easy
<Iskierka> mIRC? god no.
<Iskierka> can't even get a proper list :/
<Ascendant> yeah :|
<Iskierka> buuut I'll at least try help, if I can figure out what on earth is going on here :p
<Ascendant> I remember doing fibonacci numbers in python
<Ascendant> I had so much fun with that
<Ascendant> and yeah, thanks, I really appreciate your help
<Ascendant> and now, joy, the fun part
<Iskierka> I'll just read through this script to try understand what's happening
<prince-dari> Back.
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> wb
<prince-dari> Thanks.
<Ascendant> I think I wrote that script around 11-12 when I did
<Ascendant> It could be a lot simpler and less messy but that requires effort
<Iskierka> if ($2 isnum) && ($2 <= 5) && ($2 > 0) { <-- I think that might be possible to simplify to if ($2 isnum 1-5) {
<Iskierka> not sure and something minor, but looks like it could
<prince-dari> It has to be a number to be greater then 0.
<prince-dari> So the isnum is kind of pointless.
<Ascendant> yeah true
<Iskierka> the isnum confirms that it's a number at all
*Ascendant changes
<Ascendant> thanks
<Iskierka> np
<Ascendant> it's really the $readini parts that are confusing ;x
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Iskierka> yeah, that's why I'm taking my time over it
<Ascendant> XD
<prince-dari> Also doing it by hostname rather than nick is better. :P
<Ascendant> effort
<prince-dari> $address($nick,2) FTW
<Ascendant> but there's vhost issues and such
<Iskierka> and dynamic IP and such
<Ascendant> yeah
<prince-dari> They don't change beyond a point.
<Ascendant> eh I'd prefer nicks
<Ascendant> it's easier to check and such
<Iskierka> would be best to use a system like the chatstats where it watches nick changes and such and stores who is the same, IF you wanted that sort of feature
<Ascendant> yeah
<Iskierka> but then, some people might want it so that a particular nick of theirs has a different enabled list to another
<prince-dari> Meh, hostname is easier than that anyway.
<Iskierka> so even aside from the effort, this way is more functional
<Ascendant> you have the issue of vhosts and dynamic IPs again
<prince-dari> What issue with vhosts?
<Ascendant> of course, you can bypass vhosts using /userip
<prince-dari> People don't change them that often.
<Ascendant> that's true, but dynamic IPs are a pain
<Ascendant> and nicks are better for this system anyway
<Ascendant> anyway, bbl, I'll see you all in an hour, and thanks for your help
<prince-dari> Whatever you say. :P
<Iskierka> prince-dari, how would you propose handling mine?
<prince-dari> What do you mean?
<Iskierka> mine is just the IP, and is dynamic
<Iskierka> there is nothing consistent day-to-dsay
<Iskierka> there would be no way to track me
<prince-dari> You could write a system to track hostnames/IPs to nicks.
<Iskierka> a system which can use hostnames and nicks would be even more complex, by a large margin
<Iskierka> and relatively useless for what it gives you
<prince-dari> It'd be pretty much the same as the system to track nick changes.
<Iskierka> not especially, that's just an on *:NICK trigger that makes a list of what nicks change between each other, and then interpreting the lists later
<Iskierka> your method has to juggle two independent types of index of what gens are allowed, and consistently come to the correct consensus between them
<prince-dari> Though it would have the added bonus of working with someone who doesn't necessarily join with their main nick.
<Iskierka> people usually switch at some point, and just one switch would get the connection listed
<Iskierka> if you'll note though I'm not proposing actually using nick-tracking, I'm just saying it'd be almost as effective, and far easier to script, but still isn't worth the effort
<prince-dari> Nick-tracking could be done in only a couple lines though, and to make it work with hostnames all you'd have to do is store them when the nick-change script is used.
<Iskierka> that would store hostnames, but the script to make use of stored hostnames would be far longer
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> I could make one just to prove a point.
<Iskierka> making one and making one integrated with a script this complex isn't quite the same
<prince-dari> I thought the script was pretty much just a $read with a couple of $readinis around it?
<prince-dari> That's fairly simple to intergrate with.
<Iskierka> if by a couple you mean 26 readinis, 10 writeini, and 8 reads, then sure.
<Iskierka> plus all the conditions of selecting and handling those
<prince-dari> I still think it wouldn't be that complicated, I'd rewrite the script to make it smaller.
<Iskierka> you could, but the goal here is for full, flawless handling
<prince-dari> I don't get what you mean by that.
<Iskierka> I mean making sure it always functions as wanted
<prince-dari> It would though.

<eXAKR> An evil idea just wafted into my head
<prince-dari> Oh really now?
<eXAKR> Remember that bus forum I talked about some time back that had a flame war
<eXAKR> ?
<eXAKR> I'm going to make a clone account therer
<eXAKR> -r
<eXAKR> No one will know who I really am
<eXAKR> And then troll and post nothing but MLP:FiM pictures there
<eXAKR> When reacting to their posts
<prince-dari> You know, people hate MLP for a reason.
<prince-dari> Mainly because people post it everywhere.
<prince-dari> So you wouldn't exactly be helping the cause.
<Iskierka> the people who are posting it are posting it for a reason, they like it.
<eXAKR> in 6 months' time the entire forum will either be upside-down, full of bronies, or upside-down and full of bronies.
<eXAKR> I am doing it to troll them
*eXAKR hides
<Iskierka> you're the exception
<Iskierka> so if I disconnected, and changed my nick back to Airwolve, and my dynamic IP changed at the same time, then I switched to my bot's current nick, it would still identify me correctly, without problem?
<Iskierka> the current system won't but it's not intended to, so it works perfectly
<prince-dari> It would have a store of all the nick's you've used.
<Iskierka> and what if before that I'd never used my bot's nick?
<Iskierka> this all being assuming I brought my bot in here so the script did see it
<eXAKR> Hmmm?
<prince-dari> So you join with a never before used nick, and a different IP?
<Iskierka> the nick would have been seen with my old IP
<prince-dari> Slightly confused, so you're using a nick that's been used only with a different IP, and you've never changed to that nick from a nick linked to your main nick?
<eXAKR> Why not use NickServ?
<eXAKR> Perfectly good solution there, not used
<Iskierka> and how exactly do you link them using nickserv? last I looked nickserv doesn't tell you if two nicks are grouped
<Iskierka> my bot has the same IP as I do. If I disconnected, and the bot did too (but didn't reconnect), and the IP changed, how would it handle if I didn't use my own nick but did end up using my bot's now-vacant nick?
<prince-dari> Well your bot would have different settings to you, it's essentially separate since you've never linked the two by changing to that nick from your main nick or a linked nick.
<Iskierka> but your system supposedly tracks host
<Iskierka> ergo, it should be able to make the connection
<prince-dari> If the host changes, and the nick is unrelated then you have to assume it's a different person, otherwise all people would have one set of settings between them, because there is nothing else to distinguish between.
<Iskierka> but the host for both nicks was the same before
<prince-dari> So they were both on at the sime time with the same host?
<prince-dari> In the presence of the bot.
<eXAKR> Shouldn't the NickServ database have a list of grouped nicks?
<Iskierka> or possibly different times, your system should handle that
<Iskierka> eXAKR, try access the nickserv database? not easy
<prince-dari> Yeah, that would work.
<prince-dari> I'd have an on *:JOIN: which checks the hostname to see if it has ever been used before and which nicks it should be linked with.
<prince-dari> It it hasn't been used before it gets logged along with the related nick.
<prince-dari> If*
<prince-dari> I'll definitely give you that the script isn't as simple as I'd thought, but it's still not that bad.
<prince-dari> I'd take that any day over some socket scripts. XD I'm not that great with them on mIRC.
<Iskierka> sockets are a pain

<Iskierka> the ini would also be complex when you actually think about it. you need to be able to look for either a given host, or a given nick, inis have sections which you go to then take an item from; one of those lookups at least, would need to find and item and then look up at what the section is
<Iskierka> which doesn't look to be possible
<prince-dari> Each main nick would have 2 sections.
<prince-dari> With related nicks stored in one, and related hostnames in the other.
<Iskierka> having a generic section name and then listing nicks and hosts below would be possible, but that would make the script more complex as it would have to go through sections and likely have to do some odd item reading to locate a given nick or host
<Iskierka> so with that system, how do you take a host of a completely unknown nick, and find a nick that the host is associated with?
<prince-dari> I'd just have the sections as the mainnick $+ 1 and mainnick $+ 2 with hostnames in one and nicks in the other.
<Iskierka> or even taking a nick that isn't one of the main nicks, gonna go through every nick to find who it's connected to?
<prince-dari> That wouldn't be too bad, the list would have to pretty damn big to make any lag.
<prince-dari> And you'd only have to do it once for each new nick or hostname.
<Iskierka> true, but it would still be awkward to code a recursive system like that to search through
<Iskierka> and you'd have to do it every time a nick or host appears, for every nick that isn't one of the main ones
<prince-dari> I'd have a store of nicks/hostnames currently on the channel.
<prince-dari> And which main nick they're related to.
<prince-dari> So you'd only have to do it once.
<eXAKR> Iskierka › eXAKR, try access the nickserv database? not easy <- How so? </late>
<Iskierka> yes, but you have to do it every join, and do some updating and checking every nick change. (someone might change to a nick in another group, then those groups will need to be joined)
<prince-dari> I decided that any nicks that are used more than once just have the default settings with scripts.
<Iskierka> eXAKR, a nickserv command that lists what nicks are grouped to a particular one?
<prince-dari> Otherwise unregeistered nicks would cause problems.
<prince-dari> More than once by unlinked main nicks I mean.
<Iskierka> so if it's used again, separate it from both groups?
<prince-dari> Yeah, I suppose.
<Iskierka> fair enough, though that does then defeat the object of having all nicks used by a given person connected
<prince-dari> Otherwise unregistered nicks would destroy the whole system.
<Iskierka> and I can't give a precise example but it does feel like it might bug it
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> Think GLIST and INFO might be fo help
<eXAKR> *of
<Iskierka> glist only shows your own group according to the description
<Iskierka> and the bot knowing what alternate nicks it has won't be much use
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<Iskierka> >nickserv< glist kyu
<Iskierka> -NickServ- Access denied.
<Iskierka> nope, not much help
<eXAKR> Info doesn't seem to show alternate nicks as well
<eXAKR> But what about admins?
<eXAKR> Do they have access to this information?
<Iskierka> that might be something different, but I'm not sure the bot is an Oper, or that we want it to be
<Iskierka> nope, bot is not an oper, and making it an oper is a bad idea
<eXAKR> Why?
<Iskierka> in case an exploit appears and someone makes use of it before it's removed
<prince-dari> It tells you whether a nick is registered or not, which is helpful.
<Iskierka> that is helpful, yes
<eXAKR> Ah
<Iskierka> could make it connect across registered nicks
<prince-dari> Still doesn't solve some things though.
<Iskierka> $crlf is the most problematic exploit that could appear, and in fact has (though has not yet been taken advantage of)
<Iskierka> hrm
<Iskierka> !tstposts
<Iskierka> I wonder if something might be broken
<prince-dari> !pony $ip
<prince-dari> !pony $crlf
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> I'm sure there must be a way for the bot to access NickServ's database without being an oper
<prince-dari> I doubt it.
<eXAKR> maybe dump the database in a different location where the bot has access?
<Iskierka> that would be possible, but require more and be extremely risky
<Iskierka> a raw dump of the database, certainly, is a terrible idea
<eXAKR> hmmm
<eXAKR> As long as the passwords are stripped before dumping, I see not much risk
<Iskierka> there isn't much risk, assuming the nickserv database only contains what you'd expect it to, but some people might not want their linked nicks public
<Iskierka> oh?
<prince-dari> I don't know if it'd be of any help, it says it can though.
<prince-dari> Just wondering what happens with vhosts though.
<Iskierka> -NickServ- List of entries matching *@2.100.20.16:
<Iskierka> -NickServ- Iskierka Pop@2.100.20.16
<Iskierka> -NickServ- End of list - 1/1 matches shown.
<Iskierka> only problem I see here is it's not seeing my bot
<eXAKR> hmmm
<Iskierka> when I tell my bot to identify, it's added to the list, but that implies it only lists online and registered nicks
<Iskierka> which is somewhat less than we want
<lightumbreon|Doctor> Lung inspection, wish me luck X.x
<prince-dari> Good luck.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<HyperMetalLugia> Why :<
<prince-dari> I don't think it works unless you are looking up your own hostname/IP anyway.
<eXAKR> oo D:
<prince-dari> [12:36] -NickServ- List of entries matching *@2.100.20.16:
<prince-dari> [12:36] -NickServ- End of list - 0/0 matches shown.
<Iskierka> unless you smoke a lung inspection should come out fine
<Iskierka> aaand there's another problem then
<Iskierka> amazingly useful, yes.
<prince-dari> Status does work with other nicks though. O_o
<Iskierka> status is just telling you online/unreg'd/reg'd though
<prince-dari> Hm.
<prince-dari> BRB, getting something to drink.
<Iskierka> if ascendant returns she can tell us if glist works as an oper
<Iskierka> though that still sounds like a bad idea for the bot

<Steve> 6 prince-dari is a/an 9 Registeel
<prince-dari> 3@pokemon
<Iskierka> your system could handle nick conflicts using status though, I think. if they identify as someone who is definitely the owner of that nick, join it to theirs. If not, they're stealing or unregistered, so ignore them
<prince-dari> 3@pony

<Ascendant> ohai Draelen
<Iskierka> or hrm, maybe
<Iskierka> so that's useful to an extent, but intention of using nickserv was to get full lists of grouped nicks, which isn't possible without oper it seems
<Iskierka> and, like we've agreed now I think, not really worth the effort
<Ascendant> Well, what did you want?
<Iskierka> I think the current system works fine, if people are that desperate to disable a gen, they can do it for their common nicknames
<Ascendant> Yeah, I wasn't intending to switch to hostnames anyway
<Ascendant> It makes things more complicated, and if there's an error with something, I'd have to check their hostmask multiple times to make sure
<Iskierka> the system we were discussing was slightly more complex than that and would work fairly nicely ignoring bugs, but would be too complex to be worthwhile
<Ascendant> Ah
<Iskierka> so yeah, let's just try make what there is at the moment work
<Ascendant> yep
*Ascendant continues scripting
<Ascendant> argh crap
<Ascendant> set %pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick $+ %gennumber ] ] %gennumber
<Ascendant> I don't think that works because vars don't work inside the brackets
<Iskierka> hrm
<Ascendant> oh wait, nevermind, I think I'm being an idiot
<Iskierka> I know I've done something like that before
<Ascendant> you put the var after the stuff
<Ascendant> so like %pokegen. [ $+ [ $nick ] ] $+ %gennumber
<Ascendant> I'm pretty sure that works, unless the [] stuffs it up
<Ascendant> if that's the case I can do %pokegen $+ %gennumber $+ . [ $+ [ $nick ] ]
<Ascendant> ._.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm

<prince-dari> I wanted to kill myself.
<Ascendant> lmfao.
<Ascendant> I had that with one of my other scripts
<Ascendant> was raging trying to figure it out
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay :D
<Ascendant> Okay, I think I have it done
<Iskierka> ready to test?
<Ascendant> just adding a safeguard in case someone disables everything
<Ascendant> because if they do the script dies
<Iskierka> ahyeah, heh

<Ascendant> yeah, if there's any errors it'll probably just derp and insert an infinite loop somewhere
<Ascendant> xD
<Ascendant> oh, one more thing to test
<Ascendant> !setgen 2 on Iskierka

<Ascendant> I should add !setgen status [nick] as well
<Iskierka> so yeah, assuming it's not reset like it did on that other one, works
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> !setgen status
<ScriptBot> 1st Gen: off · 2nd Gen: off · 3rd Gen: on · 4th Gen: on · 5th Gen: off
<Ascendant> okay, didn't set mine so that's good
<Ascendant> Oh, now I remember what I forgot to add
<Ascendant> !setgen default
<ScriptBot> Syntax: !setgen [generation|status] [on|off] [nick] (Only moderators can turn gens on for nicks other than their own, normal users, or mods who wish to use it for their own nick, just use !setgen [generation|status] [on|off].)
<Ascendant> nope, let's add that now
<Ascendant> !setgen default
<ScriptBot> Your settings have been reverted to the default settings.
<Ascendant> !setgen status

<Skylands> 10loljobs
<Skylands> 10I know how you feel, I've applied to several places and not once has anyone called my in for an interview
<Skylands> 10me*
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've only ever had one interview and that's because my mum knew someone at the place I was applying for
<Skylands> 10I was talking to one of my IRL friends who is 2 years ahead of me, and he said he'd been searching for a job since freshmen year and it took him 4 years to successfully find one
<Angel_Espeon> 13eventually they didn't take me on because I lacked experience
<Angel_Espeon> 13I know I've never had a job before, but I need to start somewhere, don't I? :<
<Skylands> 10Yeah, job experience is important
<Skylands> 10I need to look for volunteer work
<Ripred> 4I've worked at a few places before.
<Ripred> 4Im hoping the economy opens up soon. Because i neeeed to get money for college
<Skylands> 10Good luck, most countries are suffering economy issues
<Ripred> 4And when jobs start opening up, architecture is the first :3 Need buildings before you can start a job

<Angel_Espeon> 13The song I am getting sick of hearing is the Lazy Song by Bruno Mars
<Angel_Espeon> 13I like being lazy, but I am sick to death of hearing that song ALL THE TIME
<Skylands> 10Radio overplayed songs, whee
<Kanoaki> 12Hey Skylands
<Skylands> 10Hi
<SilverSonic> !ew Rap songs on radio
<drfsupercenter> 05EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW RAP SONGS ON RADIO
<drfsupercenter> 03you seriously need to stop changing your name
<drfsupercenter> 03rap FTW
<SilverSonic> EW
<SilverSonic> drf has bad taste in music
*SilverSonic flees
<drfsupercenter> 03I like just about any type of music except country
<drfsupercenter> 03and stuff involving screaming, like metal etc
<Kanoaki> 12I think this is my last name change
<drfsupercenter> 03you're going to change your last name to Kanoaki?
*drfsupercenter hides
<Skylands> 10No more NightSeas?
*Ghost has changed his name
<Angel_Espeon> 13songs > genres
<SilverSonic> Agreed AE
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't have a favourite genre, just favourite songs :3
<SilverSonic> but Rap does suck in every possible way
*SilverSonic runs
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've found that I like at least one song from every kind of genre of music, so xD
<Kanoaki> 12Why, you think NightSeas is better, Sky?
<Skylands> 10Just wondering
<drfsupercenter> 03nah, there are plenty of good rap songms
<Skylands> 10[15:48] <Angel_Espeon> I don't have a favourite genre, just favourite songs :3 <- Exact opposite, my problem is I have too many favourite songs x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03go listen to Changes by 2pac
<HyperMetalLugia> Skylands, you hate everything I like
<Skylands> 10California Love > Changes
<HyperMetalLugia> Non-rap > Rap
<HyperMetalLugia> ;>
<drfsupercenter> 03California Love is nice too
<HyperMetalLugia> Opera Rap > Everything
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's mostly Dr. Dre
<drfsupercenter> 03D
<drfsupercenter> 03*XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't even have favourite songs, just some songs that I happen to listen to more than others
<Skylands> 10HML, wat.
<Skylands> 10[15:49] <HyperMetalLugia> Non-rap > Rap
<Skylands> 10?
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I have phases where I overplay one or a few songs to the point where I want to listen to anything BUT that song :B
<HyperMetalLugia> You read it right lols :p
<HyperMetalLugia> Rap crap
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<Kanoaki> 12Well, it just seems like every new name I get, it brakes someone’s trade mark some how :P (NS, Slash, ect.)
<Skylands> 10And a kanonaki is a Greek instrument
<Skylands> 10So? I like all other genres too, HML
<Angel_Espeon> 13change your name to NightCheese
<Kanoaki> 12lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13I like calling you Cheese :<
<SilverSonic> <%drfsupercenter> go listen to Changes by 2pac <-- 2Pac is dead, let his legacy die
*SilverSonic runs
<Espeon> 06[15:48] <Angel_Espeon> I don't have a favourite genre, just favourite songs :3 <-- This.
<Skylands> 10Rock/metal and hip-hop are probably my favourite
<Espeon> 06That is all
<SilverSonic> Rock is my favourite
<Espeon> 06Or well, I do have some genres I can't stand but hey :P
<drfsupercenter> 03EW UK SPELLING

<Skylands> 10Add U to every word
<SilverSonic> Eveury
<Skylands> 10Replace Z's with C's
<Skylands> 10and you're in Britain
<Kanoaki> 12Well, maybe I'll change it to Nightseas instead of NightSeas to discourage people calling me NS
<SilverSonic> Actually no replace Z's with S's
<SilverSonic> Advertise
<Skylands> 10Then we can call you N, Kanoaki :P
<Kanoaki> 12lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew Whiners

<Skylands> 10I think so
<HyperMetalLugia> I hate Practise
<SilverSonic> XD\
<HyperMetalLugia> Practice..I perfer it
<Kanoaki> 12I think, Canada spells words just like the UK
<Skylands> 10They do
<Skylands> 10Most parts anyway
<SilverSonic> but doesnt change Z's to S's
<SilverSonic> <%drfsupercenter> EW UK SPELLING <-- You'll eventually spell it when US changes the law of englishism
<SilverSonic> XD

<Nightseas> 12Now everyone can call me N :”D
<Ripred> 4going to love and tolerate the crap outa you haters
<Skylands> 10coolstorybro
<Skylands> 10That didn't last very long
<Kanoaki> 12Nope
<Espeon> 06I like how it seems like you assume that there is no thing between "bronies" and "haters"
*Espeon flops
<Espeon> 06what
<Espeon> 3[6!6espeon vars 4reset3]
<Espeon> 06Nope
<Espeon> 06I dunno what happened there
<Espeon> 06oh it was Umbreon.
<Skylands> 10!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Skylands for 12 minutes
*Espeon hides again.
<Skylands> 10Just in case
<Kanoaki> 12Na, that would be a non-brony-hater
<Angel_Espeon> 13No offence, but brony is a really silly term for fans of the show to use, IMO
<Kanoaki> 12But seriously, what name fits me best?
<Espeon> 06No, it would be someone who doesn't care a rats a** about the show? :P
<Espeon> 06I highly assume you're not serious by the way, so for once - please don't surprise me because that would be... yeah
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've said this so many times recently but
<Angel_Espeon> 13I like the show, but hate the fanbase
<Angel_Espeon> 13well not hate
<Angel_Espeon> 13but you know :B
<Novi> [!umbreon vars reset]
*Umbreon still belongs to Espeon for 0 more seconds
<Novi> :o
<Novi> :O
<Novi> haxxx
<Skylands> 10I just see it as overrated
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Angel_Espeon> 13that works too xD
<Ripred> 4haters gunna hate
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm O.o
<Ripred> 4dislikers gunna dislike*
<SilverSonic> I hax'd it
<SilverSonic> hahaha
<Skylands> 10Overused memes are overused, also.
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai Ripted
<Espeon> 06I don't care that people are fans. I couldn't care less. The only "violation" I've personally seen them doing is generally assuming that EVERYONE cares about all their thousands of pony images and seem surprised when people really do not care :P
<Kanoaki> 12I think people just like looking at the art the most
*Espeon 
<HyperMetalLugia> Espeon is right
<HyperMetalLugia> As always
<Espeon> 06And that's not all people btw
<HyperMetalLugia> ~
<HyperMetalLugia> Well eXAKR is a perfect example
<Kanoaki> 12Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> AE, I agree
<HyperMetalLugia> Worst word, it brings so much pain to my mind
<Espeon> 06But some are just really obnoxious as they over-post (not only ponies, this goes for any fandom) stuff that the majority of people do not care about. And when it's met with people honestly not caring then the desperate plan to not seem obnoxious is...
<Espeon> 06wait for it...
<Espeon> 06LOL TROLD U GUISE XD
<Espeon> 06As usual
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Kanoaki> 12Knowyourmeme says not to do exactly what eXAKR does
*Kanoaki runs
<Espeon> 06The same kind of people who never actually discuss things, to them it's just a game to either get the other person "mad" (whenever they ever respond) or "pwn them so they can't even respond" (when they block them for being totally stupid)
<Espeon> 06And that's the first good thing in a long time to come from KYM then
*Espeon rolls on AE
<Espeon> 06I'll try /EspeonRantTime now.
<Ripred> 4!espeon
*Espeon still belongs to Skylands for 7 more minutes
<Ripred> 4havnt you been ranting?
<Espeon> 06Yes. But the / indicates that I'll try to stop :3
<Kanoaki> 12But yeah, I'm just a fan. Nothing more or less
<Espeon> 06!floof

<Articuno> 12I want pineapple but Xai won't chop me any and I am too lazy to do it myself :(
<Manlyguy> I don't know what to say to that. xD
<HyperMetalLugia> I love pineapples :<
<Nick> get the birds to do it?
<Articuno> 12lol
<HyperMetalLugia> You should force Xai to chop it up XD
<Articuno> 12Thy'll eat it
<Articuno> 12ovO; LOL
<Articuno> 12tHREATEN HIM WITH A WOODPEADGE
<Articuno> 12-caps
<HyperMetalLugia> Woodpeckers?~
<Nick> muahaha that reminds me arti
<Nick> we have (sort of) tame wood pigeons coming for food now :3
<Nick> along with the two collared doves
<Angel_Espeon> 13When life gives you pineapples, feed them to Arti
<Articuno> 12YES
<Articuno> 12Best motto ever :3
<HyperMetalLugia> And HML :<
*HyperMetalLugia steals the pineapples from AE and eats them all
<HyperMetalLugia> Painfully acidic, but so good
<Nick> btw about the Newcastle meet, are you interested in art galleries?
<Nick> to anyone here who's going to it?
<Articuno> 12I LOVE art galleries
<Articuno> 12Where is there one?
<Articuno> 12I already plan to go to the anime stores
<Nick> well thinking of things to do there's the Baltic over the river (easy to walk to as the new bridge is next to it)
<Articuno> 12and plan to get lunch
<Nick> one of the most prolific in the country and I think is assosciated with tate modern in London
<Nick> anime stores yes, that animez should be open this time
<Nick> I'm still struggling to think of what to do in Newcastle except shops...
<Nick> It's possibly worth doing newcastle one day then getting the metro train or bus to gateshead the next? where the toys r us is obviously
<Articuno> 12Yes, I was thinking that
<Articuno> 12Though
<Articuno> 12Nick..
<Articuno> 12There is a bowling alley near Newcastle center right?
<Nick> not that I know of...at least I don't know where exactly
<Nick> there is the one at the MC in the Namco place
<Articuno> 12ovO
<Articuno> 12I want us to go there while we're in newcastle though
<Nick> ok but I have no clue where it is and what company it is
<Ripred> 4Gah I wish i could go to the meet
<Articuno> 12I think RN knows
<Ripred> 4hopefully next year when im 18
<Articuno> 12:3
<SilverSonic> ooh RN?
<SilverSonic> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Rocket Ninetails
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<SilverSonic> ah
<SilverSonic> :P
<SilverSonic> I get confused with RN as Radio Nintendo o3o
*SilverSonic flees
<Angel_Espeon> 13a TST meet should totally be arranged in Scarborough sometime
<Angel_Espeon> 13we have a beach ;3
*Angel_Espeon 13is shot
<Nick> I'd listen to Radio Nintendo (listens to contra boss defeat theme along with 8-bit TZZZTZTZTZTZZ explosion sound)
<Lati> 12and bumper cars
<Nick> actually I'd love to go back to scarborough
<Articuno> 12Angel_Espeon I would love that
<Articuno> 12Me and Xai can get to Scarborough way easier than Newcastle
<Articuno> 12Infact I'm bringing Lugia and Hawkie to Scarborough :>
<Angel_Espeon> 13I feel bad how everyone I talk to seems to love Scarborough, but I just think of it as a boring normal place since I've lived here my whole life |D
<Articuno> 12LOL
<Iskierka> that happens to everyone though, regardless of place and whether it's deserved
<Lati> 12You should live around here, you'll run home as soon as you turn a few corners from my house. Infested with a group of vile human beings *shudder*
<Articuno> 12I find that after I leave somewhere.. it becomes the most important place in the world to me ><
<Articuno> 12EW MANCHESTER
<Lati> 12LOL exactly
<Articuno> 12:3
<Articuno> 12It has it's uses I guess ;>

<Articuno> 12Lati are you still coming to the meet..? D:
<Lati> 12I can try and see what I'm doing/If I have enough money but I'm not too sure ^^;
<Angel_Espeon> 13In scarborough only waterstones sells manga now, and it's literally just 3 tiny rows on a small column or something. and most of it is Naruto/Bleach
<Lati> 12Probably not though D:
<Angel_Espeon> 13WHSmiths doesn't even sell manga anymore here >:/
<Nick> btw lati if you do come do you have a Kyogre from HG or Celebi on HG/SS you'd like to trade?
<Nick> or anyone here that's going to the meet?
<Lati> 12I should have a spare Celebi
<Nick> :O
<Angel_Espeon> 13Speaking of which, you stil need to give me a Celebi and Zorua sometime xD
<Nick> YOU'RE JOKING?!
<Lati> 12I went to the celebi event in Preston a while back and I think I stole 4 of them for myself, only 2 claimed soooo :3
<Nick> ON HS/SS RIGHT?

<Lati> 12Dood I don't even mind if you give a Magikarp =)
<Nick> really?
<Lati> 12the Celebi's were free for me, so why not be free to people who couldn't make it
<Lati> 12Of course ^_^

<Articuno> 12I gtg :(
<Hooh54> 4Goodbye, Arti!
<Angel_Espeon> 13Goodnight arti :3
<Articuno> 12I'm really tired anyway

<Articuno> 12Night everyone ^v^
<Nick> oh Hooh you have? Have you done the event after beating Red?
<Nick> night arti!
<Nick> also angel that's ok its a kyogre I'm after
<Kanoaki> 12Red > Ash
<Nick> do you have one caught in HG?
<Hooh54> 4Yep, HG is all finished
<Angel_Espeon> 13Do you just need it for the Rayquaza event?
<Nick> oh awesome, are you in the UK Ho-Oh?
<Hooh54> 4I can loan you Kyo if you need
<Nick> and yes Angel
<Angel_Espeon> 13Because I'm willing to trade Kyogre for Groudon so we can both get the event, so long as I can have the Kyogre back |D
<Nick> actually I want a kyogre but I have some good pokemon for trade
<Angel_Espeon> 13I kinda grew attached to Kyogre ever since he ate my shoes LOL
<Nick> that's the problem angel you need both at the same time to do it :\
<Nick> o.o
<Nick> eh?
<Hooh54> 4Kyogre > Groudon
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Nick> ^^^^
<Hooh54> 4He was my first legend figure
<HyperMetalLugia> Rayquaza > All
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Nick> oh ok
<Hooh54> 4Lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13I was walking with Kyogre behind me and he got grumpy and started eatnig my shoes
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Hooh54> 4Ho-Oh > Everything
<Nick> o.o the giant whale started eating your shoes?
<Hooh54> 4Deal with it
<Nick> wouldn't it like eat all of you?
<Nick> xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yes LOL, and he wasn't happy when I scolded him
<Angel_Espeon> 13I dunno why but I found it adorable ;w;
<Kanoaki> 12Lugia wishes he was a ho-oh
<Nick> but yeah Kyogre is one of my fave legendaries from Gen 3 and I'd like to have him but it has to be the one in HG in order to get Rayquaza to work
*Kanoaki dies
<Hooh54> 4At least they're chibi, and not full sized
<Nick> and aw you scolded him? D:
<Nick> you meany
<Hooh54> 4My Ho-Oh hugged me
*Nick loves trailing his lugia around it always hugs him in SS :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, it's not very nice to have a giant whale nomming my foot when I'm trynig to walk xD
<Hooh54> 4I still don't understand how a 12 foot tall bird can hug me, though
<Nick> with its wings?
*Nick runs
<Lati> 12how can Wailord even walk
<Hooh54> 4^
<Angel_Espeon> 13slides across the ground ;3
<Hooh54> 4How Magikarp doesn't die on land
<Nick> but yeah angel if we did meet at a RL TST meet I could have a loan of your kyogre, I have a masterball in reserve still in SS so I'll just use that on Rayquaza, then you can borrow my groudon
<Nick> whales can slide across ground?
<Nick> how come they get stranded all the time then?
<Hooh54> 4I wish I could go to a TST meet D :
<Angel_Espeon> 13not lubricated enough LOL
<Hooh54> 4I don't live in England ;~;
<Hooh54> 4But I may go this summer
<Espeon> 06what
<Espeon> 06Okay I
<Espeon> 06took things out of context
<Espeon> 06sorry
<Lati> 12I think Unown stalks me
<Angel_Espeon> 13When we bought cards LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13Unoooown

<Lati> 12THIS CAN'T BE DESTINY
*Lati sulks

<Skylands> 10It's just weird @ Nick
<Mikey> lots of places downtown are open at least really late, otherwise the only other place I know of is denny's
<Nick> just cos she's not technically real? xD

<Hooh54> 4As long as you don't take it to far
<Ascendant> +1 to anyone in here besides Xeli and Skylands who can actually insult me
<Skylands> 10You deserved it~

<Ascendant> if anyone in here manages to insult me, +1 to them ;p
<Lambda> yeah, it can be that way sometimes at these ones too
<Mikey> because unlike any other mcdonalds they go "HI WHAT CAN WE /MAKE/ FOR YOU???" and after we eat there everything is funny
<Skylands> 10I don't think I've ever insulted you before, have I?

<Quanyails> 7Bah, was going to say my good-night to her.
<SirSprinkles> 6but there was nopony else here...
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh yeah
<Hipster_Brony> 8DCD told me he was gonna drop by to train one of us on streaming
<Ghosties> 4What was the site to see how you're upload speed is?
<SirSprinkles> 6With no instructions as to whom?
<Ghosties> 4Or fast he goes?
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.speedtest.net/
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/CVmef.png
<SirSprinkles> 6*decides to test*
<Mikey> XDDD
*Hipster_Brony 8has an upload speed of 6.58
<Lambda> brb food
<SirSprinkles> 6lol 7.95
<Hipster_Brony> 8well shit man
<Ghosties> 4Bah, my upload speed is still 0.36 mbps -_-
<Hipster_Brony> 8you should be streaming
<Ghosties> 4It would be interesting to see Sprinkles stream
<SirSprinkles> 6I probably could, if I had any idea as to how.
<Ghosties> 4Doesn't he need a webcam?'
<SirSprinkles> 6A webcam? To stream? That would be... bullshit.
<SirSprinkles> 6Though I do have mic built in to my comp.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont think u need a webcam
<Hipster_Brony> 8im not sure why you would
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't see why you would...
<Ghosties> 4As long as Sprinkles doesn't randomly play music or sound over what we're showing
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<PolishSoviet> ohai Altair
<Ghosties> 4*shrugs*
<SirSprinkles> 6I wouldn't... though I'd have to set it up so my desktop ponies don't wander onto it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8DCD said he isnt going to do that outside of post show anymore
<SirSprinkles> 6Thank Celestia.
<Silverscreen> WOAH! I'm back.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles, you could just turn off your ponies for a few hours
<SirSprinkles> 6It was funny ONE TIME.
<SirSprinkles> 6After that, no.
<Hipster_Brony> 8hey silver
<Archfiend> ;o
<SirSprinkles> 6I know I could, Hipster.
<Silverscreen> 11Colour
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, btw, in case you guys didnt see
<Hipster_Brony> 8i'll be here on friday, i got out of the football camp
<Silverscreen> 11I saw that. Awesome. :D
<ScriptBot> !chatstats
<Cone> Chat stats updating.
<Silverscreen> 11So, what's the news on the streaming?
<Hipster_Brony> 8well
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles' internet is fast as hell
<SirSprinkles> 6 7.95 mbps upload.
<Hipster_Brony> 8are you able to stream this friday?
<SirSprinkles> 6I could, if I was shown how before hand.
<Ghosties> 4We need DCD in here then
<Hooh54> 4!chatstats
<Cone> This script can only be used once every 5 minutes!
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, would mean the stream would go on a LOT longer.
<Silverscreen> 11We just need DCD to show you how to do it then.
<Hipster_Brony> 8okay, astray or DCD is going to drop by at some point I guess
<SirSprinkles> 6Since I'm usually here until 2 in the morning.
<Hooh54> 4SCRIPTBOT
<Ghosties> 4Jesus, Sprinkles is right
<Hooh54> 4Y U GLITCH
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles would be streaming shit ALL THE TIME
<Quanyails> 7It's not a glitch, you fish.
<Hipster_Brony> 8imokaywiththis.jpg
<Ghosties> 4Also, no offense to DCD, but I think it would be nice to have a streamer that didn't show Captain Marvelous and sentai all the time
<Quanyails> 7But if you're curious:
<Quanyails> 7Hooh54 had a sticky shift button - wrote 87 lines in CAPS.
<Hipster_Brony> 8true, true
<SirSprinkles> 6I have very little to show...
<Hipster_Brony> 8i like captain marvelous, but it gets old
<Ghosties> 4Just show video suggestions then
<SirSprinkles> 6I could do that.
<Hooh54> 4^ Wow
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles, download some arrested development
<Nightseas> 12bbl, restart
<SirSprinkles> 6I have... xxxHolic. XD
<Ghosties> 4I'm not a fan of sentai *shrugs* But I can't really say anything because he is the streamer
<Hipster_Brony> 8im not really a fan of anything that comes from japan
<Soyuz> wut
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, my comp is a 17", so i have a HUGE screen.
<Silverscreen> 11I'm not a big fan either, mainly because it's either you have to read it or you get shitty dubbing.
<Hipster_Brony> 8true
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Damos02)03WB* - <Nightshadow|VNC> Damos, you will mate with Articuno!
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, the style just feel sweird
<Silverscreen> 11DBZ is the only series that's managed to do a good dub, IMO
<SirSprinkles> 6...lol
<Ascendant> Hooh54, it's not a glitch, it's scripted that way to prevent the mIRC stats program from glitching
<SirSprinkles> 6I love DBZ
<Hooh54> 4It just felt like less than five minutes that's all
<Silverscreen> 11So we know who our back up streamer will be. Mr. Sprinkles. :)
<Ghosties> 4Silver, I know of a series
<Ascendant> It takes up to 2 minutes for mIRC stats to upload the new stats and if another window is already running it'll screw up
<Ascendant> And that was 2 minutes lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Whoo!
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, sprinkles would be our streamer
<Silverscreen> 11Oh?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm internet important!
<Hipster_Brony> 8DCD can't make it
<Ghosties> 4Cromarti High School
<Ascendant> hell, maybe not even 2 minutes
<Ascendant> 1 minute and 20 seconds exactly
<Silverscreen> 11I'll look that up.
<Hipster_Brony> 8the test got moved back to this weekend apparently
<Ghosties> 4What test?
<Hipster_Brony> 8DCD's test
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD and his tests...
<Silverscreen> 11He's got a test for school.
<Silverscreen> 11That's been jumping around, hence all the changes to streaming we've been discussing.
<SirSprinkles> 6Has a test to see if he can take a test about taking tests, and the test is primarily based on other tests.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Silverscreen> 11Testception.
<Hipster_Brony> 8btw, just posted flutewood in a thread on /oat/
<Silverscreen> 11BWOOOOOOOOM!!!!
<Silverscreen> 11Nice.
<SirSprinkles> 6I've been posting flutewood a lot lately...
<SirSprinkles> 6That and: SPRINKLEBERG
<Hipster_Brony> 8i fluterolled a mod today
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was proud
<SirSprinkles> 6Nice.
<Mikey> make fun of band name have band of that name retweet it LOL OOPS
<Silverscreen> 11Fluterolled? XD
<Ghosties> 4Clint Flutewood
<Hipster_Brony> 8spoilered pic of a flute
<Ghosties> 4The man with no flute
<Silverscreen> 11Nice.
<Silverscreen> 11Alright, now I want to bring something to everyone's attention.
<Silverscreen> 11We have some official competition.
<Hipster_Brony> 8go on...
<Silverscreen> 11A stream's been discovered, pointed out by the very person who gave us that critical assesment that Hipster, myself, and Sprinkles replied to.
<Hipster_Brony> 8is that arcesious?
<Ghosties> 4You mean the guy that criticized DCD for doing the effects and all the people we have in chat
<Ghosties> 4right?
<Silverscreen> 11Yes. It's in the MOvie Discussion thread.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<Silverscreen> 11They're called the Symphonic Ponies movie night group.
<Hipster_Brony> 8anyway, continue
<Silverscreen> 11Aparently they stream 24/7.
<Hipster_Brony> 8not really movie night then lol
<Silverscreen> 11er, correction. Every night.
<SirSprinkles> 6Where's their stream?
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<Hipster_Brony> 8got it
<Ghosties> 4I wouldn't say this is exactly bad unless we start losing viewers
<SirSprinkles> 6And everypony will see them as knock-offs anyway.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, found the stream
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont think we have anything to worry about
<Hipster_Brony> 8they have 4 people there
<SirSprinkles> 6...XD
<SirSprinkles> 6link?
<Silverscreen> 11There is a slight chance we'll be losing viewers. Arcesious herself stated that she would choose which stream she'd prefer to visit.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it peeves me a little that they copied our exact layout though
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://symphonicmatrix.org/stream/
<Ghosties> 4We should raid
<Ghosties> 4lol
<Silverscreen> 11No, ghosties.
<SirSprinkles> 6...I've got a web block on it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Which means other ponies will too.
<Silverscreen> 11But notice that there's no stream at the moment, and the fact that they use our old version of chat means they'll run into the same mod problems we've had.
<SirSprinkles> 6Their site isn't rated, ours is.
<Ghosties> 4Silver I was just kidding
<Hipster_Brony> 8anyway
<Hipster_Brony> 8it doesnt seem like a huge deal
<Ghosties> 4It's not, we're more organized than they are
<Ghosties> 4We're "ahead of the curve" I suppose
<Hipster_Brony> 8we should keep an eye on it and ask them to not stream on fridays if it gets big though
<Hipster_Brony> 8plus, i doubt they will be able to keep up an every night movie streaming schedule
<SirSprinkles> 6That's got to be taxing.
<Ghosties> 4Right, that sounds reasonable to me
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Damos02)03WB* - <Nightshadow|VNC> Damos, you will mate with Articuno!
<Silverscreen> 11I don't like to rain on another's parade, but we kinda are the ones who started the whole general idea for this event.
<Silverscreen> 11OH! I just thought of something.
<Silverscreen> 11Er, not just now, but it's something that Arc's critique got me to think of.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey, just stating this. I could probably do a reshowing on Saturday earlier on for all the Euro bronies.
<Silverscreen> 11....that's fucking genius.
<Ghosties> 4Dude
<Silverscreen> 11Saturday Morning Movies for the Eurobronies.
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles
<Ghosties> 4You're like our savior bro :3
<Hipster_Brony> 8that would be awesome
<Ghosties> 4Or something
<SirSprinkles> 6justthatawesome.gif
<Hipster_Brony> 8we would need mods from europe though
<Hooh54> 4everyone is gone
<Silverscreen> 11How did we NOT come up with that?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<Hipster_Brony> 8unless you and dari can handle it alone
<Hooh54> 4!Pokemon'
<Hooh54> 4!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 8Sunkern.
<Silverscreen> 11What time would this occur?
<Skylands> 10You killed the chat
<Ghosties> 4Plus, I'm sure there'll be some people that revisits to see the movies again or if they missed it the night before they can see what they missed
<Ascendant> lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8how about saturday afternoon?
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<HyperMetalLugia> SHame
<Hooh54> 4I tend to bring disaster a lot
<SirSprinkles> 6I was thinking 2 PM EST
<Silverscreen> 11Afternoon...that would be a more reasonable time...
<Hooh54> 4I guess I'm a secret Absol
<Hipster_Brony> 8that way it will be night for people in europe and we can still have our regular mods
<SirSprinkles> 6Which would be like, 6 or 7 PM GMT
<Silverscreen> 11Hell, both Euro AND Ameribronies can watch then.
<Lambda> Do you know where Stormy's at?
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
<Lambda> I've been trying to talk to her on gmail and she hasn't been replying
<Mikey> no
<Hipster_Brony> 8and people who couldnt come the night before could watch as well
<Ascendant> ohai Aurora
<Ghosties> 4 2 PM sounds fine, what do you guys think?
<Mikey> ...in fact I didn't even realize she left
<Mikey> o___o;
<Hipster_Brony> 8i like it
<Mikey> well her neo's been on for like 2 hours I think she just left her computer on
<Ascendant> eh you're trying too hard to be funny lol
<Chimera> 04ROARA hi :D
<Silverscreen> 11This sounds like a hell of an idea, not to mention it actually gives me something to do on Saturdays.
<Ghosties> 4I like it too
<prince-dari> Did someone say my name?
<Ghosties> 4Man
<Ghosties> 4Dari
<Lambda> yeah, but it doesn't even show her as away on gmail
<Silverscreen> 11Hi, Dari.
<prince-dari> Hey.
*Aurora so tired today
<SirSprinkles> 6Wow.
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari, we had an idea
<Silverscreen> 11Sprinkles just gave us our revelation.
<Chimera> 04same
<Chimera> 04x-x
<Mikey> maybe it's her mother thinking that you evolved into a 60 year old man
<Ascendant> I had 4 hours of sleep
<Ascendant> as per usual
<prince-dari> Ok, let's hear it. :o
<Aurora> wel
<Mikey> like she did with SR
<Aurora> I had 8 hours
<Aurora> but
<Ascendant> ;D
<Mikey> :P
<Lambda> haha
<Aurora> still tired lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles said he can stream the movies again on saturday afternoon our time
<Ascendant> ._.
<Silverscreen> 11Saturday Afternoon Movies.
<Hipster_Brony> 8so it would be night for those in europe
<Ascendant> !setgen status
<ScriptBot> 1st Gen: on · 2nd Gen: on · 3rd Gen: on · 4th Gen: on · 5th Gen: off
<SirSprinkles> 6So it would be like, 6 or 7 PM GMT
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles pretty much just gave us an awesome idea
<Silverscreen> 11So that the Eurobronies can have a Saturday Movie Night
<prince-dari> Oh, that's awesome.
<Hipster_Brony> 8and people who missed it the night before could watch too
<Aurora> why 5th gen off lol
<Ghosties> 4Or if they want to see it again
<Ascendant> It's per-nick based
<Ascendant> I hate 5th gen
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, what timezone are you in?
<Ascendant> this is an updated version of the !setgen5 script
<Ghosties> 4But this is great, this solves one of our biggest issues
<prince-dari> I'm GMT.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's 11:30?
<Ascendant> Basically does all generations now
<prince-dari> 12:30
<Ascendant> took me ages to script :x
<Aurora> 6!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Aurora, you are a 7Snorunt.
<SirSprinkles> 6Okay.
<SirSprinkles> 6Google lied to me.
<Hooh54> 4I salute you for epic coding
<Hooh54> 4!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 2Dewgong.
<Silverscreen> 11lol

<SirSprinkles> 6But yeah, 2 PM EST would be 7 PM GMT.
<SirSprinkles> 6All is well.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, here is one potential problem
<Hipster_Brony> 8when do we do the lottery?
<Hipster_Brony> 8would it be during the friday or saturday stream?
<Ghosties> 4Hmm
<SirSprinkles> 6After the saturday.
<Silverscreen> 11Both.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's early enough for both parties.
<Silverscreen> 11We switch it back and forth
<Ghosties> 4Wait, what?
<SirSprinkles> 6I like Silver's idea too.
<Hipster_Brony> 8you mean alternate weeks?
<SirSprinkles> 6Friday one week, Saturday the next.
<Silverscreen> 11One week, we let the Friday bunch choose.
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, Hipster.
<Silverscreen> 11Exactly.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would be fine with that
<Silverscreen> 11Then we let the Saturday group choose the next week.
<Hipster_Brony> 8eliminates any possible bias
<Silverscreen> 11Same results, nopony's left out.
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<Silverscreen> 11and yeah, no biase.
<Ghosties> 4So which day are we choosing this week?
<SirSprinkles> 6I like this plan. I'm glad to be a part of it.
<Lambda> hey
<Stormy> hi
<Mikey> hi
<Silverscreen> 11which reminds me, if TUrni puts so much as one more parasprite post in our threads, I'll report his flank.
<SirSprinkles> 6He put another in?
<SirSprinkles> 6I must not have seen.
<Silverscreen> 11I like this plan, ANOTHER! *smashes fist into the screen*
<Silverscreen> 11He made a smartass comment about me doing Random MOvie Trivia.
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh. He's really getting to be a pain.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i actually talked to turnibrony in a different thread, he seemed more chill than usual
<Ghosties> 4Bah, let him bark
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, I see the post now.
<Silverscreen> 11I ignored it.
<Silverscreen> 11Guy's a Waste of energy.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i didnt really take it that way
<Hipster_Brony> 8it seemed like he was just sad he missed it
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, it's hard to read meaning behind text.
<Ghosties> 4We're making good strides and if he still wants to bitch and moan about the integrity of what people like, then he should just leave and never return because then he's just complaining about taste
<Hipster_Brony> 8he said he probably would have come last week if he hadn't had a party to go to
<SirSprinkles> 6...my comp's upload speed apparently got higher.
<Silverscreen> 11Figures.
<SirSprinkles> 6By .25 mbps
<Silverscreen> 11awesome.
<Hipster_Brony> 8and he said he's planning on coming this week and likes our movie selection
<Silverscreen> 11Sweet.
<Silverscreen> 11Oh, and I get to use this week's movie as an opportunity to get some Jaffar pics. :D
<SirSprinkles> 6lawl
<Hipster_Brony> 8nice
<Hipster_Brony> 8also
<Hipster_Brony> 8one thing we need to keep an eye out for
<Silverscreen> 11hmm?
<Hipster_Brony> 8with aladdin, there are probably going to be some racist remarks in chat, so we need to stay on top of those
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<SirSprinkles> 6>probably
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 14Illumise.
<Ghosties> 4Aladdin?
<Ghosties> 4Really?
<SirSprinkles> 6I believe you mean definately.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i like to not assume the worst
<Hooh54> 4!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 7Glaceon.
<Hipster_Brony> 8but i say 1 warning then ban, depending on the situation
<Silverscreen> 11Considering we're all bronies here, I don't think it's as likely to occur as you think, HIpster.
<Hipster_Brony> 8if somepony just types "SAND NIGGERS", I will ban them on sight
<SirSprinkles> 6I've met some pretty racist bronies, unfortunately.
<Silverscreen> 11But you're right, we *should* keep an eye out for *bad-mannered* racism
<Ghosties> 4Question
<Silverscreen> 11Asketh.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, i like to not assume the worst, but it probably will happen at some point
<Hooh54> 4!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 3Porygon 2.
<prince-dari> She really loves her books.
<Mikey> I've still never read cupcakes
<Mikey> and I don't plan to
<Ghosties> 4Since we're going to begin re-showing the stream for Euro bronies on Saturdays, will this mean that it's expected for us to return once more to mod?
<Mikey> oh lol I've seen that
<Hipster_Brony> 8ideally, yes
<Ghosties> 4I know it may seem like an obvious question, but still
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll be looking for more Euro-mods though.
<Silverscreen> 11Idealy, but not required, IMO
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<Silverscreen> 11What Sprinkles said.
<Silverscreen> 11Alright, now that we got all of that out of the way, I'd like to promote my idea.
<Hipster_Brony> 8go on...
<BusyDCD> STEP INTO MY CHOCOLATE EYES
<SirSprinkles> 6...
<BusyDCD> here it is
<SirSprinkles> 6I LIKE CHOCOLATE
<BusyDCD> the V.A.C.
<BusyDCD> http://www.megaupload.com/?d=5RK4X945
<Silverscreen> 11....
<Ghosties> 4DCD, glad you're here
<BusyDCD> I frankly don't have much of a clue as to the details
<BusyDCD> but
<Ghosties> 4We have great news
<BusyDCD> yeah, I won't be able to make i-who's pregnant?
<prince-dari> But cupcakes is funny. :<
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Ghosties> 4Me
<Silverscreen> 11Rarity Sauce is.
<SirSprinkles> 6All of us.
<Silverscreen> 11Again.
<BusyDCD> congratulations everybody!
<Ghosties> 4Even you
<BusyDCD> OH SHIT
<Hipster_Brony> 8i already emailed DCD general stuff
<Hipster_Brony> 8about the saturday stream
<Lambda> I'm with Mikey on this one
<Silverscreen> 11oh, is this a Junior incident? (Note, NEVER accept that as a bad movie)
<BusyDCD> Also mom found my ponies. She didn't exactly take it BAD but now she wants to talk to a psychologist friend of her
<SirSprinkles> 6...
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh boy
<BusyDCD> Imma just gonna show her the TIME article. When I ain't too busy
<SirSprinkles> 6Mom, I am disappoint.
<BusyDCD> she pretty much gave me a SON I AM DISSAPOINT speech but she was just worried about me being gay I guess
<BusyDCD> I'm not and I told her, maybe I convinced her, maybe not
<Hipster_Brony> 8i came dangerously close to saying "everypony" during camp today
<SirSprinkles> 6You should show her BMN! XD
<prince-dari> My parent's wouldn't care, but they'd make fun of me for at least a month.
<SirSprinkles> 6I said everypony in the middle of Hershey Park. REALLY LOUD.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i hate how people assume that liking stuff thats "girly" automatically makes you gay
<Hipster_Brony> 8...society, i am disappoint
<Silverscreen> 11My parent's wouldn't give a damn, though my dad's suspicions of my sexual preference would come up again. *rolls eyes*
<Ghosties> 4Speaking of girly stuff, did you guys see the Rule 63 Spike thread on /oat/ last night?
<Hipster_Brony> 8nope.avi
<BusyDCD> in any case
<Hipster_Brony> 8it probably went up after i went to bed
<SirSprinkles> 6My dad doesn't even care. I have Pinkie Pie sailing on his model boat that's on top of the tv. XD
<Silverscreen> 11I was busy in /rp/ again.
<BusyDCD> I hear Sprinkles is gonna get trained?
<Hipster_Brony> 8indeed
<SirSprinkles> 6:D
<Ghosties> 4Yes
<BusyDCD> lemme see if I can ask Astray to train you
<BusyDCD> cause this week's gonna be hell
<Hipster_Brony> 8cuz his internet is fast as fuck
<BusyDCD> and I better get back to work
<SirSprinkles> 6YESSIR
<Silverscreen> 11Sprinkles internet is best adept for it
<Ghosties> 4And Sprinkles is gonna air the stream on Saturdays for the Euro Bronies
<SirSprinkles> 6*retests*
<BusyDCD> that said however, Hipster, you should grab that VAC and have it handy. Just in case
<BusyDCD> also keep in mind my internet is not very fast either way
<BusyDCD> 1.99 Mbps
<prince-dari> O_o
<prince-dari> Really?
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh, and we're talking about doing the selection lottery alternating weeks
<BusyDCD> speed is not exactly an issue
<prince-dari> Wow.
<BusyDCD> BUT
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL 8.97 MBPS
<BusyDCD> you can't go overboard with quality
<Hipster_Brony> 8so it would be on friday one week, saturday the next and so forth
<BusyDCD> because if you do
<Ghosties> 4Jesus
<Ghosties> 4 8.97
<prince-dari> Are you guys talking DL or UPL?
<BusyDCD> your viewers are just going to see a freakin' slideshow
<BusyDCD> oh right
<Hipster_Brony> 8UPL
<Hipster_Brony> 8right?
<SirSprinkles> 6UPL
<BusyDCD> my UL is, what
<BusyDCD> 0.96?
<BusyDCD> in any case
<SirSprinkles> 6My DL is 12 MBPS
<BusyDCD> even if you have a huge UL
<Ghosties> 4Wow
<prince-dari> 8.97 upload? Holy hell.
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles
<BusyDCD> using it would basically kill viewership
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<BusyDCD> the video feed can become a jumbled mess, plus
<BusyDCD> slideshow
<BusyDCD> so yes
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't plan on using it like crazy.
<Ghosties> 4Wait, so are you saying that Sprinkles shouldn't stream?
<BusyDCD> 564 Kbps seems like the best course of action
<BusyDCD> no no
<Hooh54> 4!pokemon
<Silverscreen> 11He's saying don't stream at highest quality
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 10Alomomola.
<BusyDCD> I'm saying that you should all get trainin' in the stream sort of things
<SirSprinkles> 6High upload would allow me to easily stream while doing other things.
<BusyDCD> that too
<Silverscreen> 11And that. Get trained.
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<BusyDCD> yeah
<BusyDCD> pretty much
<BusyDCD> which is a great idea
<Ghosties> 4I'd like to bring something else up at some point tonight
<Ghosties> 4But we can finish this first
<Hooh54> 4!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Hooh54, you are a 12Teddiursa.
<BusyDCD> bring it up while I get Astray
<BusyDCD> since I have to go back to work and all
*Skylands yawns
<Hipster_Brony> 8and make sure to turn off your desktop ponies, sprinkles
<Skylands> 10Script spam everywhere
<SirSprinkles> 6they're already off
<Hipster_Brony> 8downloading VAC
<SirSprinkles> 6Though, like I said, I can restrict where they walk.
<HyperMetalLugia> It makes me cru
<HyperMetalLugia> *Cry
<Ascendant> !script !pokemon off
<ScriptBot> The !pokemon script is now off.
<Hipster_Brony> 8how do i open this file, DCD?
<Ascendant> ohsnap
<Skylands> 10Can anybody do offscript?
*Ascendant idles
<Ascendant> nope
<Ascendant> only ops
<Skylands> 10k
<Skylands> 10I was about to say
<Ascendant> or at least +v
<Ascendant> er mods
<Silverscreen> 11Do you have an archive progrom, Hipster? Like WinRar?
<Silverscreen> 11program*
<Ascendant> derp
<Ascendant> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> This script is disabled! Join #ircgames to use the script or ask a moderator to enable it!
<Ascendant> !poekmon
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have 7Zip, if that's what you mean
<SirSprinkles> 6lol my upl speed is getting higher every time I test.
<Silverscreen> 11Good. Right click the zipped file and choose "extract here"
<Mikey> I JUST GOT THE DICE A ROO AV
<Mikey> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
<prince-dari> Is this the cafe wifi?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i extracted it already, but i can't open the file
<SirSprinkles> 6It is.
<Lambda> :D
<prince-dari> What ISP do they have?
<Silverscreen> 11...then I can't help you.
<SirSprinkles> 6Umm... Comcast I think.
<prince-dari> So high. O_o
<Stormy> Neopets dice games all hate me
<prince-dari> Well it's late and I still have work to do.
<prince-dari> BBL
<SirSprinkles> 6It's either Comcast or AT&T...
<Silverscreen> 11WHat the hell?! I got comcast, and my internet DIES on a daily basis.
<SirSprinkles> 6k, see ya Dari.
<Ghosties> 4Alright dari, see ya
<Silverscreen> 11bye, Dari
<Hipster_Brony> 8its a .7z file (is that even real?)
<Hipster_Brony> 8bye dari
<SirSprinkles> 6I have to check now...
<Silverscreen> 11Alright, then, to my proposal...
<Lambda> any game of luck hates me
<Mikey> I am having seriously luck with avs lately
<Mikey> omg
<BusyDCD> 7z files ARE real
<Silverscreen> 11Arc's critique mentioned the fact that Chat moves so damn fast, a problem we've noticed as well and just shrugged off. BUT! I came up with a solution. If we make several unofficial rooms, we can have the viewers branch off into each so that they can talk in that place as well as the official chat. Each mod can host a different room.
<Lambda> then again, I'm the type of gambler who cashes out at the same amound I started with
<Lambda> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6It's AT&T here.
<Stormy> XD
<BusyDCD> they're basically the spealization of 7Zip
<BusyDCD> *specialization
<BusyDCD> just extract it
<Ghosties> 4...Hmm
<Ghosties> 4What do you guys think?
<Ghosties> 4I'm cool with it, I guess
<Silverscreen> 11It's the same as having several rooms of a theater.
<BusyDCD> it brings too many problems
<Silverscreen> 11it does?
<SirSprinkles> 6It would be way too complicated.
<BusyDCD> yes, the fact that you'd have to moderate two rooms simultaneously
<Hipster_Brony> 8extraction inside an extraction
<BusyDCD> it simply isn't viable, and would result more difficult
<SirSprinkles> 6People going "I WANT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS THIS PONY" too.
<BusyDCD> however, I'd like to know something
<Silverscreen> 11Point.
<BusyDCD> is there a way to limit chat speed?
<Hipster_Brony> 8extracted, what do now?
<BusyDCD> we could limit each person typing to a 15-second interval
<Ghosties> 4Isn't there a way to limit how fast people respond?
<Ghosties> 4Like DCD is saying
<BusyDCD> Hipster: http://www.niharsworld.com/2008/06/16/use-virtual-audio-cable-vac-to-solve-missing-stereo-mix-problem/
<Silverscreen> 11There's a way to set a time limit between someone's posts, like what Ponychan has.
<SirSprinkles> 6Of course right after Dari left...
<Hipster_Brony> 8damn, we should have asked dari while he was here
<Ghosties> 4A script, possibly?
<BusyDCD> other than that, no clue
<Ghosties> 4DARIIIIIIIIIIIIII
<Hipster_Brony> 8omg
<SirSprinkles> 6HIPSTER GET OUT OF MY HEAD
<Ghosties> 4*weeps*
<Silverscreen> 11And again, that would be Dari's forte.
<prince-dari> What?
<Hipster_Brony> 8theres a guy on /oat/ who is talking about changing his name to steven magnet
<SirSprinkles> 6MAGIC
<Hipster_Brony> 8for realz
<Silverscreen> 11Figures that our master of the chat is in another country.
<Silverscreen> 11I saw somepony who was seriously considering changing their name to Rainbow Dash, despite being a guy.
<SirSprinkles> 6dari, teach me everything you know about chat.
<Silverscreen> 11ponyshrug.jpg
<SirSprinkles> 6In ten seconds flat.
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver, its the same guy
<Silverscreen> 11oh.
<Hipster_Brony> 8somepony convinced him that steven magnet would be better
<Silverscreen> 11lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8which would be epic as hell
<Silverscreen> 11Damn Magnet, how does he work?
<SirSprinkles> 6But dari, do you know how to set a time in between letting people post?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yo DCD, that link you gave me was junk
<Hipster_Brony> 8it jumped me to like 4 different spam sites
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/OTZur.png
<Lambda> I want to do this at a sporting even now
<Lambda> XD
<BusyDCD> dunno hipster, I know naught of Virtual Audio Cable
<prince-dari> Pretty sure you could only set that up if you are running the network yourself, so have access to services, other than having a script that kicks people who say more than a certain number of lines in a number of seconds.
<Hipster_Brony> 8heres the problem with that
<Silverscreen> 11damn.
<BusyDCD> so
<Hipster_Brony> 8people who do things like this
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh
<Hipster_Brony> 8my
<Hipster_Brony> 8goooooooooooooooooood
<Silverscreen> 11we don't want to kick people just because they talk too much
<BusyDCD> there is an access command for that?
<Silverscreen> 11and do stuff like that.
<Ghosties> 4Damn, I do that for emphasis -_-
<Hipster_Brony> 8if you break them up like that for comedic effect, you could end up getting kicked
<BusyDCD> mods obviously won't have that problem
<BusyDCD> since their job is to talk and all
<Hipster_Brony> 8but still
<Silverscreen> 11It would still effect viewers
<prince-dari> I mean you could make a script that sets +m if a certain number of messages goes into the channel in a certain amount of time, and which removes it after 3 seconds or so.
<Silverscreen> 11And again, we don't want to kick somepony just for doing a silly joke.
<prince-dari> Though I don't see how that'd help, because people spam loads after +m has been set.
<Damos> http://pokedamos.deviantart.com/art/Lugia-and-I-part-1-comic-213193181
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, because then the spam goes FUCKING NUTS when the +m is lifted.
<Damos> I hope its not too bad
<Astray> sup :V
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey.
<Astray> I'm here
<Skylands> 10Nice
<Hipster_Brony> 8hey astray
<Silverscreen> 11If we had more mods, we could split into only two rooms.
<Astray> who are the ones?
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow
<SirSprinkles> 6HI!
<HyperMetalLugia> O,o
<SirSprinkles> 6Me.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles
<Astray> and?
<Silverscreen> 11But I don't think we're at that level just yet.
<Silverscreen> 11Sprinkles.
<Silverscreen> 11And sprinkles.
<Astray> :V
<Silverscreen> 11and Hipster.
<Astray> oh
<Damos> I need to pratice more
<Damos> it sucks
<Hipster_Brony> 8i still dont know what to do with this VAC though
<SirSprinkles> 6But dari, could you try and look into it for us, since that's really your thing.
<Silverscreen> 11I think he has, sprinkles.
<Astray> k. step 1: get flash media live encoder
<prince-dari> I'll see if there's anything I can do other than setting up an IRC server.
<prince-dari> Though I can do that if needed.
<Silverscreen> 11If that's the case, then we might as well do the whole Pony Server thing as we planned. :/
<Silverscreen> 11: /
*Roleplay4life 5rolls around
<BusyDCD> what I wish to know is
<Astray> when both of ya have dl'd the thing call me :V
<BusyDCD> what's the progress with the Notifications-to-Viewers system?
<Stormy> maybe that would get you on TV
<Hipster_Brony> 8are you talking about the listserv?
<Silverscreen> 11Damn. I completely forgot about that.
<SirSprinkles> 6Working on it now, Astray.
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> in that case maybe not
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, that's what he's talking about, hipster.
<Hooh54> 4I hai
<Hooh54> 4*Oh
<Skylands> 10Damos, no way, it's really good
<prince-dari> I wonder if you can set +m on individual users.
<Roleplay4life> 5Hey~ 8D
<Hipster_Brony> 8no movement on it yet that i know of
<Silverscreen> 11Sprinkles, Hipster, Astray: It'd be easier if you three got a room of your own.
<Astray> http://images.4chan.org/gif/src/1308086721797.gif
<Astray> HOLY FUCKING SHIT
<Astray> DEM TITS
<Silverscreen> 11#Training
<Ghosties> 4all I see is a picture of 4chan.org
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm still watching this part of the chat though. XD
<Hooh54> 4I agree :3
<Damos> but its not straoght
<Damos> straight*
<Damos> hey Roly Poly Chan
<Ghosties> 4Wait, why are you suggesting Sprinkles, Hipster and Astray have their own rooms?
<Roleplay4life> 5:|
<Roleplay4life> 5Lol hi.
<Ghosties> 4Does it have to do with their streaming capabilities?
<prince-dari> I suppose I could setup a system where everyone gets a voice upon entry and +m is enabled, you say more than a certain number of messages in an amount of time and you lose your voice for a set amount of time, and add commands to remove/add everyone's voice of course.
<SirSprinkles> 6No, ghosties, you silly filly.
<Skylands> 10Use a ruler next time?
<Hipster_Brony> 8just so that our stream training doesnt conflict with the rest of stuff
<prince-dari> So you can still mute the chat.
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties: so Astray can train them without mod chat interfereing.
<prince-dari> How does that sound?
<Skylands> 10Either way, I don't think it really needs to be any straighter o.o
<Ghosties> 4What about me ._.
<Silverscreen> 11Prince-dari: Now there's an idea.
<SirSprinkles> 6Then we'd have to unvoice EVERYBODY and revoice them during/after the lotto.
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties: Are you training to be a streamer?
<prince-dari> As I said.
<Damos> well only that closeup tall building is mess up
<prince-dari> I could add a command for that.
<Ghosties> 4Well, for one, my UPL is complete shit
<SirSprinkles> 6That would work, then.
<Damos> I thought I had it straight but I didn't
<Damos> oh well
<Ghosties> 4So I couldn't stream if I wanted to
<Silverscreen> 11So it's a no.
<prince-dari> I'll do it when I have time, how long should people lose their voice for, and how many message would they have to say in how long?
<Damos> thanks
<prince-dari> Normally about 6 messages in 8 seconds warrants a kick on IRC.
<Ghosties> 4Which is what I thought was the reason for Hip, Sprinkles, and Astray having their own rooms was because they have the UPL to stream. It's no biggie, it's what I thought in the first place
<Skylands> 10You're welcome
*Quanyails 7simmers metaphorically.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sounds good to me
<Silverscreen> 11Shorten it to 5 for 5 and I think we have a good setup.
<Damos> hey drfinator
<SirSprinkles> 6...hmm...I apparently have run out of food...
<Damos> hey Quany CHan
<prince-dari> Fine, I'll do it when I have time, but now I REALLY have to go.
<Roleplay4life> 5Hey Quan, hey DRF. :3
<SirSprinkles> 6k
<Silverscreen> 11goodnight, Dari
<Ghosties> 4See ya dari
<Silverscreen> 11Sleep well.
<Hooh54> 4Yo Quan
<Hipster_Brony> 8see ya dari
<SirSprinkles> 6You've got all week, no rush. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6G'night.
<prince-dari> Thanks, cya.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles, im down to just the food i dont really want
<Sneas> 03httttttttttttttt
<Quanyails> 7You know parents that want to control your life? O_o
*Silverscreen 11activates DariLurkmode.exe

<Damos> yes
<Damos> mine
*Silverscreen 11is living off of Ramen and water. :P
<Quanyails> 7I'm going to fume as much as I can (read; not so much) about my tug-of-war between 'em.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol, i got lunch at chipotle today on the football team's expense account
<SirSprinkles> 6I have NO food, silly.
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was glorious
<Damos> okay
<Ascendant> !script !pokemon on
<ScriptBot> The !pokemon script is now on.
<Silverscreen> 11You should get some Ramen. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6I got baked on the expense of a nearby township. XD
<Astray> we need tits.
<Silverscreen> 11No, we don't.
<Ghosties> 4What?
<Hipster_Brony> 8plenty of time for that later
<Ghosties> 4I return to "we need tits"
<Damos> !script !pokemon off
<ScriptBot> User error: Access denied.
<Roleplay4life> 5o-o
<Quanyails> 7When your parents think they know what's best for you even though you have no interest, and persuade you to take certain classes that you struggle (read, get less than an A), and have said parents get annoyed (read, exacerbate previous word) when you don't reach that 90% mark.
<Damos> !script !pokemon off
<ScriptBot> User error: Access denied.
*Silverscreen 11will begin working on "IT'S PONY NIGHT!!!" tomorrow. :D
<Damos> The !pokemon script is now off
<Astray> ><Astray>: we need tits. <Silverscreen>: No, we don't.
<Damos> I agree
<Astray> HOW CAN YOU CALL YOURSELF A MAN?
<Silverscreen> 11Easy, I have a cock. :P
<Astray> trannies have cocks too
<Astray> :3c
<Astray> and faggots
<Ghosties> 4What are you implying Astray?
<Astray> I'm implying nothing
<Silverscreen> 11Ow.
<Quanyails> 7Now, I, on the D&D alignment system, fluctuate between true neutral and lawful good. Rebelling is not my strong point. o3o
<Astray> I'm merely stating that having a penis does not make you a man
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Silverscreen> 11....
<Ghosties> 4Biologically, it does
<Silverscreen> 11abandonchat.gif!!!!
<Silverscreen> 11....wow, that actually worked. >.>
<Ghosties> 4IT SURE IS QUIET IN HERE
<Astray> biologically it makes you a male
<BusyDCD> I think he meant "we need to see some tits"
<Astray> not a man.
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, this chat took a turn for the worse while i was texting
<BusyDCD> /goes back to work
<drf-Droid> EW THAT FACE
<HyperMetalLugia> Ew this ...text
<HyperMetalLugia> Rebelling needs to be done
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<Quanyails> 7Yeah, if I could care less about emotions (read, literally, and not the misinterpreted version of).
<Silverscreen> 11Anywho, I'll be working on the "It's Pony Night!" vid tomorrow through Friday. And with my knowledge in After Effects and Premier, I can even throw in a little something for Brony Movie Night at the end of it. *coolshades*
<Hipster_Brony> 8awesome
*HyperMetalLugia puts on headphones and plays some music
<Ghosties> 4Sweet man
<Ghosties> 4DAT PLUG
<HyperMetalLugia> Since I'm getting confused by your sentence order/point
<Hipster_Brony> 8let me know when you're done with it, and i'll send it to Sethisto in the weekly email
<Damos> !sneas
*Sneas now belongs to Damos for 32 minutes
<Silverscreen> 11I'll likely just throw it onto Youtube. See how much hate I get for it.
<Silverscreen> 11It'll be my very first Youtube vid
<Ghosties> 4I'll brb guys
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe you can summarise your rant?
<Quanyails> 7Okay, in teal deer form: Raging (if you can call it that) about parents that think you're their ambitions.
<Silverscreen> 11k
<HyperMetalLugia> Blue deer do not exist...what
<Quanyails> 7tl;dr.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i mean, send me the link after you post on youtube
<HyperMetalLugia> Well most parents are silly and don't know a thing :P
<Silverscreen> 11I understood.
<HyperMetalLugia> Or are just crazy, those are dangerous
<Silverscreen> 11So, other than the training for HIpster and Sprinkles, is there anything else to discuss here?
<Hipster_Brony> 8listserv
*Quanyails 7is too nice for actual action. o.O
<Silverscreen> 11I thought we pretty much agreed that we just need ARGH to tell us how to work it?
<HyperMetalLugia> I just go verbal or do the exact opposite :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8do you want to run point on that?
<HyperMetalLugia> (Of what they want to do, that is)
<Silverscreen> 11Which reminds me, I haven't seen a daily /oat/ in a while.
<Quanyails> 7I suppose, but it's not like you can actually change anything. v.v
<Silverscreen> 11You mean do I want to go through with it?
<HyperMetalLugia> Patience changes everything eventually
<Quanyails> 7Yes, yes...
<Hipster_Brony> 8can you talk to him about it
<Hipster_Brony> 8?
<Quanyails> 7A year or two of high school left.
<Ghosties> 4There's one other thing I wanted to talk about, but you guys go ahead
<Silverscreen> 11All I gotta do is wait for the next Daily /oat/ thread and I can bring it up with him in there.
<Hipster_Brony> 8and also let him know what our movies are this week
<Silverscreen> 11Can do.
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/0WuTI.png
<Silverscreen> 11What is it, Ghosties?
<Silverscreen> 11We covered just about everything else.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i guess you can email him or post it in the /collab/ thread
<Silverscreen> 11there's that too...it's been inactive otherwise.
<Ghosties> 4I hope you guys don't think this too forward of me, but I wanted to see what you guys thought about making Sprinkles a full op
<Aristeo> rawr
<Aristeo> Hey everyone :)
<HyperMetalLugia> Guesstimation or truth?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8im for it
<Hipster_Brony> 8i actually emailed DCD about it
<Ghosties> 4I want Sprinkles to be full op
<Ghosties> 4He's clearly committed to the BMN, he brings ideas to the table, he participates
<Quanyails> 7Whaddya think?
<HyperMetalLugia> Truth?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would be surprised if it isnt unanimous
<Astray> Ghosties, I want a room full of lolis.
<Stormy> haha
<HyperMetalLugia> You seem uncertain about it
<Astray> :3
*Quanyails 7tilts a paw on the horizontal axis.
<Quanyails> 7(Perpendicular to the ground, of course.)
<Ghosties> 4And I want to bang the fuck out of Ellen Page
<Ghosties> 4But this is more realistic
<Quanyails> 7Er, parallel.
<HyperMetalLugia> Er, why not cardinal?
<Astray> and I just found out Rebecca Black has some huge tits
<Ghosties> 4Rebecca Black's 13, man
<Ghosties> 4I think
<Hipster_Brony> 8too bad shes annoying as shit and way, way underage
<Quanyails> 7Relative.
<HyperMetalLugia> Add some compass points and a tangent?
<Quanyails> 7I'd rather not share more details about my life, but I've got to oblige to more of my parents' commands.
<Astray> DCD
<Astray> DCD
<Hipster_Brony> 8and not particularly attractive
<Astray> DCD, can you explain for me?
<HyperMetalLugia> Quanyails needs a twitter
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Astray> because I'm lazy and I'm teaching the guys on the other chat
<Ghosties> 4Is everybody else being trained right now?
<Silverscreen> 11I'm not
<Silverscreen> 11It's only Hipster and Sprinkles.
<BusyDCD> I'd explain, Astray
<BusyDCD> but I don't know shit about her
<BusyDCD> cause I don't give a shit about her
<Astray> bro

<BusyDCD> /thread
<Ghosties> 4She's underage mang
<BusyDCD> also something something Brazil's age of consent something something
<Astray> Age of Consent = 14
<Astray> trollface/jpg
<Ghosties> 4Where is Astray from?
<Astray> hell
<Astray> :3
<Hipster_Brony> 8still weird
<Skylands> 10!sneas
*Sneas still belongs to Damos for 14 more minutes
<Skylands> 10!umbreon
*Umbreon still belongs to Espeon for 0 more seconds
<Skylands> 10Blah
<Hipster_Brony> 8also, i'll just leave this here: http://www.theonion.com/articles/man-knows-unsettling-amount-about-nationwide-ageof,3716/
<Silverscreen> 11...I'm going to be straight up honest. it's a subject that I wish to avoid conversations like this in general, and if it's something that you're going to be bringing up in every chat, Astray, I won't want to be around to hear it. (er, read it, rather)
<SirSprinkles> 6...why are we talking about Rebecca Black?
<Archfiend> bbl
<Ghosties> 4Astray likes her
<Hipster_Brony> 8astray brought it up
<Ghosties> 4Apparently
<Ghosties> 4Or something
<Skylands> 10Seeya
<Silverscreen> 11Astray's talking about wanting to bang her and somehow that led into the subject of age-of-consent. A subject that I'd like to drop now.
<Hipster_Brony> 8good idea
<SirSprinkles> 6I agree.
<Ghosties> 4So Sprinkles
<Ghosties> 4Silver
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties
<Ghosties> 4What do you guys think about making Sprinkles a full op?
<Silverscreen> 11I'm good for it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol, asking sprinkles if he wants to make himself a full op
<Silverscreen> 11...did Bristle ever show up on Friday? I don't remember.
<Hipster_Brony> 8he did
<Ghosties> 4I think yeah
<Ghosties> 4He did
<Ghosties> 4But I guess we agree, Sprinkles should be made full op
<Hipster_Brony> 8he was here for pre-show and most of the movies i believe
<Silverscreen> 11well, he wasn't around for long then.
<Silverscreen> 11either that or was incredibly quiet.
<Silverscreen> 11Or I wasn't paying attention.
<Hipster_Brony> 8he was quiet
<Astray> baaaaaaaaaw
<Hipster_Brony> 8he was here the whole time though
<Astray> you guys are too serious :3c
<Ghosties> 4I have to agree with Silver. It's a touchy situation and she's only 13. Not getting my hands in that
<Hipster_Brony> 8unfortunate phrasing, ghosties
<Ghosties> 4Lol touchy
<SilverSonic> I'm playing Brawl nao ;D
<Ghosties> 4*ahem* Still
<Astray> ba-dum-pshhhhh
<SilverSonic> XD
<SilverSonic> so brb for awhile
<Ghosties> 4Silver's uncomfortable with it, so let's stop talking about it
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes, lets
<Astray> :3c
<Silverscreen> 11I don't seem to be alone in that either.
<Astray> ok, then, let's talk about rape, pregnancy and abortion
<Astray> TONIGHT ON BRONYSTATE: POLEMIC NIGHT
<Astray> :3c
<Hipster_Brony> 8...anyway
<Hipster_Brony> 8shall we discuss ponies?
<Astray> good idea.
<Silverscreen> 11Rape's overrated, Pregnant people are either lucky or stupid, depending on the situation, and abortion is all about personal beliefs. /topic
<Astray> I heard there was this guy who had sex with ponies
<Astray> is that rape?
<Ghosties> 4It's bestiality
<Astray> it sure is bestialism
<Hipster_Brony> 8rainbow dash is my favorite pony
*PolishSoviet pokes Altair
<Astray> :3c
<SirSprinkles> 6My favorite pony is the one with the mane.
<Silverscreen> 11ha
<Astray> My favorite pony is...
<Astray> oh wait.
<Silverscreen> 11So your least favorite is the bald pony?
<Astray> I don't even like ponies :V

<Hooh54> 4Back
<Ghosties> 4Don't think you'll find any girls here mang
<Ghosties> 4FiM is for men anyways
<Astray> girls wouldn't come here bro
<Astray> that's the sad truth
<Hipster_Brony> 8i know, FiM is just too manly for them
<Astray> you mean too gay right?
<Hipster_Brony> 8nope.avi
<Ghosties> 4If you say so *shrugs*
<SirSprinkles> 6YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED INTO THE HERD
<SirSprinkles> 6RESISTANCE IS FUTILE
<Hipster_Brony> 8plus, dont women usually love gay guys?
<Hipster_Brony> 8if it were gay, how come there are so few women?
<BusyDCD> niggas, Astray's gonna Astray
<Astray> women LOVE gay guys... to never have sex with
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats fine, FiM isnt a dating site anyway

<BusyDCD> Astray takes pride in being the Brave Troll King
<Ghosties> 4In any case, DCD, we've been talking it over and we were wondering you'd be fine with making SirSprinkles a full op
<BusyDCD> ACCESS ADD SirSprinkles 5

<SirSprinkles> 6Hipster
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, no audio
<Hipster_Brony> 8should be streaming
<SirSprinkles> 6I got audio, nevermind

<Hipster_Brony> 8is it working?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Silverscreen> 11We got rickrolled.
<Astray> I see
<Silverscreen> 11And lag.
<Astray> it's capping your mic audio
<SirSprinkles> 6So much lag.
<Hipster_Brony> 8how do i reduce lag?
<Astray> Lag can be because of your net connection
<NewDCD> Hipster_Brony have you tried the VAC?
<Hipster_Brony> 8okay.jpg
<Astray> or your computer being unable to process the video
<NewDCD> probably the latter
<Hipster_Brony> 8what do i do with it?
<Astray> DCD
<Ghosties> 4Congratulations, Sprinkles
<Ghosties> 4Jesus, he's been lurking this whole time...
<Ghosties> 4You're a fast fucker, good Sir. As soon as you were given Op
<Astray> what do you use for the audio cap?
<NewDCD> Stereo Mix
<Ghosties> 4Wait, who's currently streaming?
<Astray> there
<Hipster_Brony> 8me
<NewDCD> but Hipster's can't use it
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<NewDCD> also I don't see shit cap
<Astray> that's because you're a nigger DCD. stop stealing his audio
<Astray> I know you're my nigger version, but DAMN man :VB
<Astray> :V
<Ghosties> 4COULD IT BE TRUE?!
<Astray> reminds me of the time when NIGGA STOLE MY ELECTRICITy
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey, where is it going to pull audio from?
<Astray> your mic
<SirSprinkles> 6My mic?
<Ghosties> 4Lag
<Astray> so if you start fapping, we'll know
<Silverscreen> 11The lag is incredibly.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well... any way to change that? I'm in a cafe?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yo, DCD, what do i need to do?
<Astray> DCD, audio's with you.
<Astray> since I stream from my mac, I have the app capture the video
<Astray> so yeah
<Astray> dunno how to solve that
<Astray> also
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL I HAVE OP AND HALFOP SO I'M HIGHER ON THE LIST THAN THE OPS
<Astray> the lag can be due to 2 things
<NewDCD> Sprinkles: NOPE
<Astray> FUCK YOU SPRINKLES
<Hipster_Brony> 8lolz
<SirSprinkles> 6It shows me higher.
<Astray> ONORAY SPRINKLES
<NewDCD> you don't, you have Access type 5
<SirSprinkles> 6...aw, now it doesn't.
<Astray> :3c
<SirSprinkles> 6I HEAR YOU LAUGHING
<Ghosties> 4Bwahahahaha
<Ghosties> 4Poor Sprinkles
<Hipster_Brony> 8DCD?
<NewDCD> OH NO RAY SPRINKLES, DIE JOE BOO
<Hipster_Brony> 8wat do?
<NewDCD> no signal ye-oh there were go
<Astray> so hip
<NewDCD> well you'd have to tinker with
<SirSprinkles> 6But yeah, any way to make the audio come from not my mic?
<NewDCD> VAC
<Astray> what can you tell us aboot your net connecshun?
<NewDCD> but dunno how to do that, so it captures your audio
<Hipster_Brony> 8astray, what do you need to know?
<NewDCD> here
<NewDCD> try this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5DJPV8Mbbk
<Hooh54> 4Hai
<Astray> your connection speed. how fast can you upload shit
<Astray> www.speedtest.net
<Hipster_Brony> 8 6.5 MBPS-ish
<Astray> stop streaming, take the test
<Astray> for UPLOAD?
<Hipster_Brony> 8already did
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<Astray> or for download?
<Astray> oh ok then
<Hipster_Brony> 8upload
<Astray> then your net is NOT the problem
<Ghosties> 4Strange
<NewDCD> lags like the fist of the north star
<Hipster_Brony> 8is it because my comp is slow as shit?
<Astray> problem is your computer being unable to handle the amount of data
<Astray> what can you tell us aboot your GPU?
<Astray> and processor
<Astray> and RAM
<Hipster_Brony> 8its a straight out of the box HP laptop that I got 3 years ago
<Hipster_Brony> 8filled with tons of shit that makes it slow
<Astray> oh
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats all i know
<Astray> then yeaaaaah
<SirSprinkles> 6ARGH 7z files
<Hipster_Brony> 8im terible with technology
<Astray> you'll most likely be unable to streasm
<Astray> due to: 1: laptop
<Hipster_Brony> 8okay.jpg
<Ghosties> 4What about Sprinkles then
<Astray> they usually have shitty graphic cards
<Ghosties> 4He has a higher UPL then Hip
<SirSprinkles> 6Working on getting the VAC up.

<Hipster_Brony> 8i just changed it to black
<Kosoveon> I should be happy that schools over...but it kinda just reminds me that after next year I'll pretty much lose contact forever most of the people I know
<SirSprinkles> 6On what program?
<Kosoveon> even the people I just talk to casually I find myself missing a lot...dunno why
<Skylands> 10Because you've been with most of them for 3 years

<Hipster_Brony> 8not the encoder
<PolishSoviet> anyone good with Genetics
<Kosoveon> indeed
<Kosoveon> that's what I realized...how quickly you take those people for granted
*Kosoveon is rather introspective today
<Skylands> 10Nope

<SirSprinkles> 6Fawking lag.
<SilverSonic> I'm having fun messing around in brawl

<Skylands> 10Well, I gtg now, so seeya
<Skylands> 10I gtg, seeya
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm trying to figure out what the issue is...
<SirSprinkles> 6It's running good even when it hits the program, and my upload speed is fantastic.
<Hipster_Brony> 8*shrug* i guess you could wait until DCD or astray gets back in here
<Ghosties> 4CONFOUND THOSE INTERNET PROBLEMS. THEY DRIVE ME TO eat
<SirSprinkles> 6...lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8wtf, its 10:15 already?

<NewDCD> you're using VHScrCap, right?
<Light_Latias> D:
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Kosoveon> missed her :/
*Kosoveon always misses everyone
<Light_Latias> same :(
*Light_Latias randomly huggles Kosoveon
<Hipster_Brony> 8how are we going to stream if it doesnt work with either me or sprinkles?
<Chimera> 04LL~
*Kosoveon huggles back
<NewDCD> okay Sprinkles
<NewDCD> go to the settings tab
<NewDCD> make sure it's set to 30 FPS
<NewDCD> also make sure all boxes are left unchecked, except the ones in the top right related to resizing
<NewDCD> make sure linear resize is checked, for example
<NewDCD> everything else must be unchecked
<NewDCD> check for those settings
<NewDCD> in my experience there's terribad lag with anything else checked
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 4Omastar.
<Kosoveon> life is complicated
<Kosoveon> but worth every minute
<SirSprinkles> 6Everything is set like that, already.

<SirSprinkles> 6trying again
<Umbreon> 12besides you are too far away XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Any issues?
<NewDCD> gimme a sec
<NewDCD> bootan
<Chimera> 04bbl
<nickstr> wow
<NewDCD> some stuttering on this end, but I suppose it's serviceable
<nickstr> One Republic's Appologize on AM
<SirSprinkles> 6Lemme try a different video.
<Kosoveon> night all
<SirSprinkles> 6This one is just plain bad.
<Armads> o/
<SirSprinkles> 6Good?
<SilverSonic> Not really'
<SilverSonic> XD
<Armads> I hate being a nocturne. :|
<SilverSonic> well how far is baldwin from your place o3o'
<NewDCD> hm, I barely noticed stuttering this time
<Astray> well gents
<Astray> I'll be leavan'
<Astray> nighto
<SirSprinkles> 6The stuttering is only because I have to use VAC.
<NewDCD> I'd say
<SirSprinkles> 6It's the very best I can get.
<NewDCD> most definitely serviceable
<SirSprinkles> 6G'night Astray.
<SirSprinkles> 6AWESOME.
<NewDCD> I'd say you should try to bump up the quality to the stock BronyState settings though
<SirSprinkles> 6video or audio quality?
<NewDCD> as in, 500 Kbps Vid/ 64 Kbps Audio
<SirSprinkles> 6Just a sec.
<SirSprinkles> 6The vid is at that, the audio isn't.
<SirSprinkles> 6Restarting.
*Light_Latias plays the Nocturne of Shadow
<SirSprinkles> 6Good?
<NewDCD> play again
<NewDCD> I'd say it runs well in this end
<NewDCD> we'd have to ask other viewers
<SirSprinkles> 6Awesome.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<Umbreon> 12mapquest on shortest distance
<Umbreon> 12says 118.36 miles
<NewDCD> seems the lower quality is due to the youtube vid
<NewDCD> but it's serviceable
<SirSprinkles> 6It is due to the vid.
<Ghosties> 4Alright, so what's going on?
<SirSprinkles> 6Restart your vid, Ghosties.
<Ghosties> 4I did
<SirSprinkles> 6We want to see how it's working.
<Ghosties> 4It looks good so far
<SirSprinkles> 6Awesome.
<Ghosties> 4No lag, video looks good
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, the main problem is I forgot to turn some stuff off, it seems.
<Ghosties> 4It's kinda low quality, but otherwise it runs fine
<SirSprinkles> 6This YTP is just low quality in itself.
<SirSprinkles> 6Lemme try something that's higher quality.
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<SirSprinkles> 6Switching.
<SirSprinkles> 6Look good?
<Ghosties> 4I can't hear anything : /
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<Hooh54> 4Hello guys
<Ghosties> 4Nevermind
<Ghosties> 4my volume was low
<SirSprinkles> 6LULZ
<SirSprinkles> 6Is the vid good?
<Ghosties> 4The only thing is that it looks kinda lower quality
<Ghosties> 4Hmm
<Ghosties> 4It looks...fuzzy
<EccoCode> Good evening everyone.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hmm... that's odd.
<Ghosties> 4But again, otherwise, this is great. At least it runs fine
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm giving over 500 kbps video...
<Ghosties> 4Maybe DCD can help, or Astray later
<SirSprinkles> 6Easily.
<NewDCD> the vid is much better than the last one
<NewDCD> okay, that seems to clinch it
<Ghosties> 4It doesn't look "clear," you know what I mean, DCD?
<SirSprinkles> 6The last one was a poor quality vid.
<NewDCD> now we should deal with the last two things we're missing
<NewDCD> Ghosties, whatchoo mean?
<NewDCD> you notice small scanlines?
<NewDCD> that's even in mine
<NewDCD> I believe it's due to the size of
<NewDCD> Sprinkles' selected area being smaller
<SirSprinkles> 6It's because the video is resized smaller.
<Ghosties> 4Like the text looks blurry and the video looks fuzzy
<NewDCD> ergo, next time, try making it a bit bigger
<NewDCD> yeah most definitely the fact it's zoomed in
<NewDCD> Sprinkles
<NewDCD> btw
<SirSprinkles> 6?
<NewDCD> did you set the resolution in FME to 756 x 500-something?
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles you chose this ep right?
<SirSprinkles> 6Or not. Oo
<SirSprinkles> 6lol
<SirSprinkles> 6One sec, the resolution reset itself somehow.
<NewDCD> in any case
<NewDCD> we should get working on two things
<Ghosties> 4You never got that Applebloom trip, did you XD
<SirSprinkles> 6No, I did not.
<NewDCD> first, getting someone that can useBronyState to stream the S2 episodes live as they air on the Hub
<NewDCD> second, the whole "BronyState Viewer Notification System"
<Ghosties> 4Viewer Notification System?
<SirSprinkles> 6The listserv
<SirSprinkles> 6Restarted
<NewDCD> I kind of meant
<NewDCD> a sort of
<SirSprinkles> 6Video still good?
<NewDCD> okay so
<NewDCD> change it back
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<NewDCD> cause it's stuttering like shit now
<NewDCD> or just lower it a bit
<NewDCD> anyways I meant some sort of newsfeed for BronyState viewers
<NewDCD> so they can know news about the channel
<SirSprinkles> 6This good?
<NewDCD> be notified of out-of-schedule extra streaming sessions
<SirSprinkles> 6>out-of-schedule extra streaming sessions
<NewDCD> nope, stutteran
<SirSprinkles> 6You mean whenever I'm on near every night?
<SirSprinkles> 6Okay, fixing.
<NewDCD> I just meant some sort of...dunno, like those news twitters keeping people updated with news about the subject at hand
<NewDCD> since a big chunk of our viewers
<NewDCD> are not from Ponychan
<SirSprinkles> 6I like this idea.
<NewDCD> so yeah
<NewDCD> basically
<NewDCD> a news feed
<Ghosties> 4Back
<NewDCD> maybe we should do like The Daily /oat/
<NewDCD> and make an e-mail as well
<NewDCD> kind of a newsletter
<Ghosties> 4Oooooh, so there's gonna be a twitter for the BMN?
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<NewDCD> I'm heavily uninclined for "Twitter"
<NewDCD> As I dislike Twitter
<NewDCD> and not everybody has Twitter
<Hooh54> 4Hello?
<SirSprinkles> 6I. Dislike. Twitter.
<NewDCD> that said we could probably make a RD-Network group for the BMN
<Ghosties> 4Look, I hate social networking as much as the next guy
<NewDCD> and post updates there as well
<Ghosties> 4But having something for Twitter would give us more exposure
<NewDCD> okay so
<NewDCD> e-mail Newsletter, RD-Network Group, Twitter Account
<SirSprinkles> 6running again
<NewDCD> those three might be
<NewDCD> obligatory
<NewDCD> any other ideas
<NewDCD> ?
<Ghosties> 4...facebook?
<NewDCD> smooth
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD, is it good again?
<NewDCD> albeit much lower quality than before
<NewDCD> it had a bit more higher quality earlier
<Ghosties> 4Why can't I hear anything?
<SirSprinkles> 6It should be the same quality as when it was running smoothly before.
<Ghosties> 4And my volume is high
<NewDCD> well it wasn't looking fuzzy for me before
<NewDCD> and now it does
<SirSprinkles> 6I stopped it.
<Ghosties> 4That was much fuzzier : /
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohai?
<SirSprinkles> 6Should be good now.
<SirSprinkles> 6Forgot to fix something.
<SirSprinkles> 6>>; Had to reopen the program 'cause it froze and forgot to fix things.
<SirSprinkles> 6It good?
<Ghosties> 4Fuzzy, and I can't hear anything
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD, you have audio?
<SirSprinkles> 6Hm...
<Hooh54> 4Ohai
<Hooh54> 4It was quiet here
<SirSprinkles> 6Good now?
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I can hear now
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, brb
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<SirSprinkles> 6Have to go afk
<Ghosties> 4Okay
<NewDCD> Okay so
<NewDCD> E-Mail/Rainbow Dash Network Group/Twitter
<NewDCD> I was also thinking on adding a news tracker bar
<NewDCD> to this page
<Ghosties> 4A news tracker?
<Ghosties> 4How would that work?
<NewDCD> more like a ticker
<NewDCD> I just want some sort of news update here
<Ghosties> 4Well, I mean, we do set the topic message to display what's currently going on manually
<Ghosties> 4But do you mean you want something that's always visible?
<NewDCD> well, maybe that's not a good idea
<NewDCD> we still need more ways to notify the subscribers
<NewDCD> I'm not too keen on using facebook for that
<NewDCD> also DAMMIT APPLEJACK
<SirSprinkles> 6back
<NewDCD> also I hear no audio either nwo
<NewDCD> you might need to bump it up
<Ghosties> 4I hear audio
<SirSprinkles> 6It's low... apparently.
<Ghosties> 4It's not very loud though
<SirSprinkles> 6Working on it.
<SirSprinkles> 6How about now?
<eXAKR> 570+ pony pictures
<eXAKR> that bus forum's gonna be trolled to the pits of hell
<Ghosties> 4It's still sounds the same
<SirSprinkles> 6Silly fillys that totally weren't directly next to eachother in Ep. 1 or anything...
<Ghosties> 4Shhh
<Ghosties> 4Don't talk about that
<Ghosties> 4The creators didn't want you to know
<eXAKR> anyway
<eXAKR> bbl soonish
<Ghosties> 4Woah
<Ghosties> 4It's lagging
<SirSprinkles> 6It's my comp. I just opened like, four things.
<Hooh54> 4!eXAKR
*eXAKR now belongs to Hooh54 for 14 minutes
*Hooh54 4runs for life
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<SirSprinkles> 6...oh, Cupcakes.
<Ghosties> 4These were SFW cupcakes
<SirSprinkles> 6WOW SUDDENLY HUGE
<Ghosties> 4THIS EPISODE'S ABOUT RELIGION
<SirSprinkles> 6IT IS.
<Ghosties> 4THEREFORE, I HATE IT
<SirSprinkles> 6Got sound?
<Ghosties> 4Yes, I have sound
<eXAKR> bbl restarting computer and getting food for myself
<eXAKR> also shower
<Ghosties> 4No, but seriously, I don't get how people can say the ep's about religion
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL EP SWITCH
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not really.
<SirSprinkles> 6It can be applied, but really shouldn't be.
<Ghosties> 4Maybe it's about having faith in your friends
<Ghosties> 4NAHHHHHHHHHHH
<SirSprinkles> 6It... really is.
<Ghosties> 4That's too farfetched
<SirSprinkles> 6NAAAAAH
<Ghosties> 4IT'S ABOUT RELIGION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Ghosties> 4Bleh, some people
<SilverSonic> yay he left
<NewDCD> but yeah
*SilverSonic hides
<NewDCD> I'd say that you should just deal with Audio
<NewDCD> you using VAC or Stereo Mix?
<NewDCD> in any case
<NewDCD> if you have problems getting the material for Friday
<NewDCD> I can probably point you in the right direction
<SirSprinkles> 6Probably should now.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, fark, how have I not yet finished dloading all the pony eps? Oo
<SirSprinkles> 6VAC, DCD
<Ghosties> 4Have you downloaded the movies, Sprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<SirSprinkles> 6Didn't know I'd be doing this until today, so not yet.
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<SirSprinkles> 6Fucking lightning rods, how do they work?
<NewDCD> Sprinkles
<SirSprinkles> 6?
<NewDCD> y'got no Stereo Mix?
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<NewDCD> what OS are you using?
<NewDCD> it might just be out of view
<NewDCD> if you're in Vista or 7
<SirSprinkles> 6I probably do.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm in Vista.
<NewDCD> go to "Recording Devices"
<SirSprinkles> 6k
<NewDCD> and select "show disabled"
<NewDCD> if Stereo Mix is there
<NewDCD> enable it, lower its volume
<NewDCD> and use it as the Audio Capture Device in FME
<NewDCD> it should also help with the suttering
<SirSprinkles> 6No Stereo Mix...
<NewDCD> well
<NewDCD> seems VAC's the only option
<NewDCD> you might have to tweak around with it
<Chimera> >:c
<SirSprinkles> 6I have been.
<Hooh54> 4!Chimera
<SirSprinkles> 6It was the mane problem in the first place... >>;

<SilverSonic> !chimera
<Ghosties> 4Well, Sprinkles, here we are again
<SirSprinkles> 6Indeed.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, it probably won't be this bad on Fridays since I'll be streaming forever. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6As opposed to the postshow lasting for such a short time.
<Ghosties> 4Oh my
<Ghosties> 4You may take over for DCD at some point
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, his stuff is a bit better quality.
<Ghosties> 4Considering he already mentioned that he may not do this forever
<SirSprinkles> 6So when he can I'd prefer him to.
<SirSprinkles> 6But when he goes for the night I'd be glad to take over.
<Ghosties> 4I agree
<Ghosties> 4But man, you saved our butts

<Ghosties> 4You solved a massive problem we were having with getting the stream out to the Euro guys
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Damos02)03WB* - <Nightshadow|VNC> Damos, you will mate with Articuno!
<SirSprinkles> 6I CAN COUNT TO BOOKS
<Ghosties> 4MAYBE
<Ghosties> 4TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH
<Ghosties> 4The other neat side effect is that we have something to watch now XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I know. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll probably end up streaming even when there's nopony here, just incase somepony stops in. XD
<Ghosties> 4Stop clopping to ponies, haha
<Ghosties> 4There's a video specifically about Rarity making those sounds
<Ghosties> 4And it's about "stop clopping"
<SirSprinkles> 6Hello Glass_Arm
<Glass_Arm> Hi!
<Ghosties> 4I AM YOUR GOD
<Ghosties> 4Wait
<Ghosties> 4wait
<Ghosties> 4wait
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Glass_Arm> No you are not
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles, would you like to do the honor?
*Glass_Arm giggles at Ghosties
<SirSprinkles> 6I AM YOUR GOD HERE
<Ghosties> 4I didn't mean kick me asshole
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6You know it's cause your my pony.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Glass_Arm> Who here goes to the mylittlepony subreddit?
<Ghosties> 4Mah pirate pony
<Umbreon> 12o-o
<Ghosties> 4I don't
<HSX> Night probably.
<drf|laptop> 03:<
<Ghosties> 4It's kinda lagging, Sprinkles
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<HyperMetalLugia> Nii Chime
<SirSprinkles> 6It's 'cause I was on fb
<SirSprinkles> 6Better now?
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, but still split second lags
<Glass_Arm> I'm on my mobile phone. what movie is tonight?
<SirSprinkles> 6No movie tonight.
<Ghosties> 4Not tonight, Glass_Arm
<SirSprinkles> 6Just test streaming.
<SirSprinkles> 6Movies are Friday.
<Ghosties> 4We're just working out the kinks for this coming Friday
<Glass_Arm> Oh
<Ghosties> 4It's starting to look like you won't be able to stream without closing everything else but the stream :S
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<SirSprinkles> 6I have /oat/ open.
<Glass_Arm> What is /oat/ about?
<SirSprinkles> 6fbook lags my comp like crazy.
<Ascendant> Where's Feather >:
<LL> nini Chime D:
<Glass_Arm> fuck FB
<Glass_Arm> stare at flanks
<Glass_Arm> FlankBook
<SirSprinkles> 6I think my post just got eaten by the chat.
<Glass_Arm> Repost then
<SirSprinkles> 6It was just that fbook normally lags my comp at least a little.
<Ghosties> 4What the
<Ghosties> 4Huh
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<SirSprinkles> 6I had to check on something important.
<Ghosties> 4 /oat/ is the random board on Ponychan
<Ghosties> 4I know that's late
<Ghosties> 4Don't care
<Glass_Arm> Oh
<Glass_Arm> funny name
<Glass_Arm> heh
<Ghosties> 4Did you download all the eps, Sprinks?
<Glass_Arm> must also be the furry board
<SirSprinkles> 6All up to a certain point.
<SirSprinkles> 6I dloaded most of them one day and then got lazy.
<SirSprinkles> 6I think the latest I have is E16.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep, E16, Sonic Rainboom.
<Glass_Arm> I need to download eps
<Glass_Arm> so I can start making YTPs
<Ghosties> 4How does the vid look, Glass_Arm?
<Glass_Arm> Which vid?
<Ghosties> 4The one now
<Glass_Arm> wat
<Ghosties> 4?
<Ghosties> 4Refresh your vid to the left
<Glass_Arm> I am totally lost
<Ghosties> 4Okay, see the video on the left of the chat?
<SirSprinkles> 6He's on his phone.
<Glass_Arm> I'm on my mobile
<Ghosties> 4Oh right
<Glass_Arm> Sorry :/
<Ghosties> 4Bah, nevermind haha
<Ghosties> 4 /oat/ is the furry board? Well, there was that Rule 63 thread of Spike the other night
<Ghosties> 4And everybody and their mothers whined about it
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo Wut?
*Glass_Arm doesn't bother to look up the rule
<SirSprinkles> 6Wut ARE you talking about?
<SirSprinkles> 6 63: There is furry porn about it. No exceptions.
<Ghosties> 4Rule 63 means "for every male character there is a female equivalent"
<SirSprinkles> 6...
<Glass_Arm> Oh
<SirSprinkles> 6Darn.
<SirSprinkles> 6I was wrong.
<Glass_Arm> That would be awesome actually
<Ghosties> 4It can be awesome
<Glass_Arm> Unless it gets kinky
<Ghosties> 4But then most butthurt closet homo dicks think it's "sick"
<SirSprinkles> 6*cough4chancough*
<Glass_Arm> ^
<Ghosties> 4I'm sure 4chan loves it
<SirSprinkles> 6FAWK I LOVE THIS SONG.
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo How do -I- not have Show Stoppers?
<Ghosties> 4Especially considering you love Applebloom, freak >_>
<SirSprinkles> 6Apple Bloom is awesome.
<SirSprinkles> 6Deal with it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, may lag in a sec, about to start dloading movies and eps.
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<SirSprinkles> 6Though I have no idea where to get the movies.
<Ghosties> 4We can probably have a meeting tomorrow to discuss that
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<SirSprinkles> 6AND THEN LAG
<Ghosties> 4I'm glad you got made full op, by the way
<SirSprinkles> 6So am I.
<SirSprinkles> 6:D
<Ghosties> 4I was pushing for it when you were made halfop
<SirSprinkles> 6I know, I was there.
<drf|away> 03*WB02(May02)03WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
<Glass_Arm> I am the next half-op
<SirSprinkles> 6lol dloading things = massive lag.
<Glass_Arm> hurr
<Ghosties> 4Hmmm
<Glass_Arm> jk
<Ghosties> 4*taps chin*
<Glass_Arm> I haven't been here for movie night yet, even
<Ghosties> 4The secret to becoming a mod is a secret
<Glass_Arm> *okay*
<Ghosties> 4Yes, I meant to use repetition :)
<Ghosties> 4Or did I?
<Ghosties> 4Fuck, I don't know
<Ghosties> 4In any case, you should come to the BMN
<Glass_Arm> Ok
<Glass_Arm> I need to make time
<Ghosties> 4Well, we have good news for you
<Glass_Arm> :O
<SirSprinkles> 6There's going to be a second showing from now on!
<Glass_Arm> Oh sweet
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<Glass_Arm> When will that be?
<Ghosties> 4Saturday at 2 PM EST
<SirSprinkles> 6Starting at 2 PM EST on Saturday.
<Glass_Arm> :D
<Glass_Arm> That's perfect
<Ghosties> 4It lets people that weren't able to catch it the night before catch it now, but the main reason is to cater to the bronies in Europe
<Glass_Arm> Oh
<Ghosties> 4Where their time is about five hours ahead of the U.S.
<Glass_Arm> Because you love them too
<Ghosties> 4I don't love them
*Ghosties 4honestly had no idea to respond to that >_<
<Glass_Arm> Love and tolerate the shit out of them?
<SirSprinkles> 6Look at all the clone bg ponies.
<Ghosties> 4Love and Tolerance is a purely subjective mantra that is left up to the discretion of the individual
<Glass_Arm> :(
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, tolerance of intolerance is intolerance itself.
<Ghosties> 4Whatever the fuck that means
<Glass_Arm> No paradoxes pls
<SirSprinkles> 6lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Silly cat lady
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Ripred02)03WB* - <Ripred> 04google is for noobs
<Ghosties> 4In any case, you're gonna find people that are Fluttershies or whatever, and Gildas like me
<SirSprinkles> 6And Pinkies like me.
<SirSprinkles> 6=P
<Ghosties> 4Yes
<Glass_Arm> I must be the Twilight
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Archfiend> bbl
<Ascendant> bbl
<Ghosties> 4Are you a bookworm?
<Glass_Arm> I read a lot
<Glass_Arm> spend a lot of time
<Glass_Arm> reading news article
<Glass_Arm> antisocial
<Glass_Arm> yup
<Ghosties> 4*nods* Yeah, you'd be a twilight
<Glass_Arm> And I practice magic
<Glass_Arm> with magnets
<Glass_Arm> Oh and I'm atheist
<Glass_Arm> very key
<Ghosties> 4So I bet you felt that Feeling Pinkie Keen was about religion, don't you?
<Glass_Arm> Ghosties: I deeply felt it was
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm atheist. I just thought it was about trying to understand that everypony has their own view on everything.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not just religion.
<Ghosties> 4I felt like it was having faith in your friends
<Glass_Arm> That fits as well
<Ghosties> 4Oh, Dragonshy
<Ghosties> 4WAIT
<Ghosties> 4NO
<Ghosties> 4Swarm of the Century
<SirSprinkles> 6lulz
<Ghosties> 4Fucking parasprites
<Ghosties> 4ruining everything
<Ripred> 4quiet chat is quiet
<Ghosties> 4Huh, Glass_Arm left
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, it's not like he could see the vid.
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<Ghosties> 4Sprinks, do you that I'm dominating?
<SirSprinkles> 6Which makes the chat a lot more boring, unfortunately.
<Ghosties> 4*think that
<SirSprinkles> 6Not really.
<SirSprinkles> 6I think you can be assertive, but so are a lot of people.
<Ghosties> 4Thanks, I think being assertive is a good thing. I really try not to be a bad guy. I mean, sure, I'm an ass but I do it for a good cause
<drf|laptop> 03we're all avoiding you
<SirSprinkles> 6I tend to act very... jokingly.
<Ripred> 4:(
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm like a half-serious parasprite.
<Hooh54> 4You do NOT mess with Fluttershy
<SirSprinkles> 6I am so Pinkie.
<Ghosties> 4Yes, you are definitely that pony on screen
<Ghosties> 4Not that one
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Ghosties> 4That one
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo how far back is your stream?
<Ghosties> 4Twilight is taking a parasprite
<Ghosties> 4Now pinkie is declining
<Ghosties> 4Trumbone
<SirSprinkles> 6Say when Rainbow Dash talks.
<Ghosties> 4leaves
<Ghosties> 4She's talking
<SirSprinkles> 6Wow.
<Ghosties> 4This is normal though
<SirSprinkles> 6So far back.
<Ghosties> 4Don't worry about it
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Ghosties> 4DCD mentions how the streamer sees ahead of everyone else
<Ghosties> 4Welcome newcomer
<SirSprinkles> 6Ah.
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Hello anon.
<Ghosties> 4Are you downloading?
<SirSprinkles> 6I am.
<Ghosties> 4Right, so that explains the lag
<SirSprinkles> 6So bits of lag here and there.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<SirSprinkles> 6brb
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<Ghosties> 4Hey, anon, are you seeing this vid?
<Ghosties> 4Well...fuck
<SirSprinkles> 6back
<Ghosties> 4WB
<Light_Latias> laaa
<Hooh54> 4Coooooooo
<SilverSonic> laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
*SilverSonic flees
<Hooh54> 4COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Hooh54> 4For those that don't know, Latias noise
<Ghosties> 4IT'S RAINING PARASPRITES
<SilverSonic> laaa
<SirSprinkles> 6AND THEN MAGIC RUINED EVERYTHING
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<Ghosties> 4Stupid Twilight
<SirSprinkles> 6lol Pinkie
<SirSprinkles> 6PINKLEBERG
<Hooh54> 4Goodnight :3
<Ghosties> 4I seriously thought Pinkie's VA was the voice of Bubbles in the Power Puff Girls
<Ghosties> 4I can't believe it was Tara Strong
<drf|away> 03*WB02(eXAKR02)03WB* - <eXAKR> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon-Punching bendy buses!
<SirSprinkles> 6I seriously thought so too.
<SirSprinkles> 6TARA STRONG IS EVERYWHERE.
<Ghosties> 4Yes she is
<Ghosties> 4Every fucking where
<Ghosties> 4Pinkie Pie
<Ghosties> 4Strutting like a boss
<SirSprinkles> 6THREAD EVACUATION IN PROGRESS
<SirSprinkles> 6Fillydelphia. XD
<Ghosties> 4Manehatten
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<SirSprinkles> 6Canterlot = DC
<Ghosties> 4I thought of Camelot o.O But DC isn't farfetched in the least
<Ghosties> 4Hah, saved it
<Ghosties> 4Good job
<Ghosties> 4Next, dear Sprinks?
*eXAKR puts the Space Core, Rainbow Dash, and Nyan Cat in the chat
<eXAKR> I will just leave them here
*Glacymr yawns at eXAKR
<Ghosties> 4Oh ho ho, Boast Busters
*eXAKR falls asleep
<Glacymr> 12yay
<SirSprinkles> 6Episode Trivia: The GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie tastes like Blue Raspberry..
*eXAKR zzzz
<Ghosties> 4Really o.o
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<SirSprinkles> 6There was a syrup thread that devolved (I didn't think they could either) into what TGAP Trixie would taste like... and apparently that.
<Ghosties> 4I remember the infamous menstruating thread
<Ghosties> 4Was that the thread?
<SirSprinkles> 6It wasn't.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was a thread that somepony posted the screencap of that thread in.
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<SirSprinkles> 6And then images of Trixie using a rope to get herself off, wringing out the rope, and drinking it. So. Disturbing.
<Ghosties> 4Dude
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, it was messed up.
<Ghosties> 4Sounds like a performance artist, haha. Kinda like what Trixie is, really
<SirSprinkles> 6...gog I love Rarity.
<Ghosties> 4BUT WHAT ABOUT APPLEBLOOM
<SirSprinkles> 6Apple Bloom is better.
<SirSprinkles> 6But Rarity is indeed up there.
<Ghosties> 4I think Rarity is probably my least favorite main pony
<SirSprinkles> 6I just wish I could be that fancy and proper.
<Ghosties> 4Too bad you aren't showing these on Youtube, then you could turn the captions on and have lols
<SirSprinkles> 6I know. XD
<Ghosties> 4I wonder if you went on youtube if the quality would be better...
<SirSprinkles> 6Not at all.
<SirSprinkles> 6The quality on my end is 720p.
<SirSprinkles> 6On youtube the best I could get would end up being 360p.
<SirSprinkles> 6Anything else buffers like hell.
<Ghosties> 4Weird
<Ghosties> 4If anything, it probably is because of your laptop then. DCD has a PC I believe
<SirSprinkles> 6It's the laptop.
<SirSprinkles> 6But still, something is something.
<Ghosties> 4Indeed
<SirSprinkles> 6It also probably doesn't help that this laptop is 3 years old.
<Ghosties> 4Well, yeah, there's that too
<SirSprinkles> 6I like how the wind starts before she starts using her magic.
<Ghosties> 4Twilight's a powerful fucking mage
<Ghosties> 4She may as well be the very best in Equestria, next to Celestia and Luna
<SirSprinkles> 6I call serious Mary Sue.
<Ghosties> 4Where?
<SirSprinkles> 6Twilight.
<SirSprinkles> 6She is a Mary Sue.
<Ghosties> 4Maybe, but it's not like she has a love interest or anything. And, she is the main protagonist, so, calling her a Mary Sue in a television show is a bit out there, no?
<SirSprinkles> 6Meh.
<SirSprinkles> 6I agree on the love interest thing.
<SirSprinkles> 6But I'm sure if she was put on a Mary Sue litmus, she'd at least get Uber-Sue.
<Ghosties> 4Meh, I guess
<SirSprinkles> 6But, meh.
<Ghosties> 4But only because she's mega powerful and she's the main character
<SirSprinkles> 6I get Uber-Sue on most litmus tests.
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Ghosties> 4litmus?
<SirSprinkles> 6Mary Sue litmus tests.
<SirSprinkles> 6Wow lag at the end.
*Ghosties 4has never taken a litmus test
<SirSprinkles> 6They're usually quite stupid.
<Ghosties> 4You like the CMC, don't you?
<SirSprinkles> 6I like Apple Bloom.
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't really care about Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle.
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<SirSprinkles> 6Though Scootaloo has her moments.
<SirSprinkles> 6SO MUCH LAG
<Ghosties> 4There needs to be an episode dedicated where Scootaloo is the leader of the group. Maybe that's what Cutie Mark Chronicles was
<SirSprinkles> 6Practically.
*Cqis roars
<Ghosties> 4How funny
<SirSprinkles> 6ADVENTURE
<Ghosties> 4I mean, Sweetie Bell's singing VA is Applebloom's normal VA
<SirSprinkles> 6I know. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Watch it for the plot.
<Ghosties> 4Wow
<Ghosties> 4That full grown pony had the cry of an infant
<Ghosties> 4How bizarre
<Aristeo> :D
<Aristeo> <e
<Aristeo> <3
<Cqis> lol
<Ghosties> 4Huh, isn't that Cheerilee?
<SirSprinkles> 6It is.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, lag.
<Ghosties> 4I didn't realize Cheerilee and Twilight were friends
<SirSprinkles> 6Twilight.
<SirSprinkles> 6Friends with EVERYPONY.
<Ghosties> 4Does that make her more of a Mary Sue?
<SirSprinkles> 6Gog. It's such a pain to have half my screen taken up.
<Ghosties> 4Just stop streaming man, no one's here right now and no one expects you to stream
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<Ghosties> 4*sigh* Alright man
<SirSprinkles> 6It gives me a reason to watch ponies.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'd have my screen taken up by it anyway. XD
<Ghosties> 4Hah, right
<Mikey> hi
<Lambda> Hey Mikey
<Mikey> sup
<Lambda> how's it going?
<Lambda> not much right now
<Mikey> nothing much just got back from dinner
<Ghosties> 4Hmmm, perhaps you should have taken a cue from the Apple user on Ponychan and named yourself Apple with the trip "Bloom"
<Lambda> just updating the PS3 and writing a dA journal
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<Mikey> cool
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, that's how one pony is already on ponychan.
<Mikey> I got both cd and vinyl today and the vinyl looks so kick ass
<Lambda> :D

<eXAKR> bbl, gonna talk to it
<Mikey> no I literally just got home lol, ripping CDs now
<Mikey> aaaand I ate too much and now I have a stomache ache :C
<Lambda> D:
<Ghosties> 4In ancient times
<Ghosties> 4Hundreds of years before the dawn of time
<Mikey> I had my bacon sandwich and half my pancakes then I was like LETS BRING IN A SIDE OF FRIES and ate half of those
<Mikey> and
<Mikey> ghurogdhr
<Ghosties> 4Lived a strange race of people, the druids
<Mikey> IT WAS WORTH IT
<Lambda> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I always picture "Bohemian Rhapsody" to this part of the ep.
<Lambda> what did you have to eat?
<Mikey> all the things I just mentioned
<Ghosties> 4I think of Spinal Tap's "Stonehenge"
<Lambda> oh haha
<Lambda> I missed that post
<Lambda> my bad
<Mikey> :P
<Lambda> was that today we were talking about that restauraunt?
<Lambda> it feels like it was longer ago than that
<Lambda> like it was yesterday
<Lambda> haha, it was today
<Lambda> my memory sucks
<Lambda> :P
<Mikey> XD this morning
<SirSprinkles> 6I want to know which of those two is Peachy Pie.
<SirSprinkles> 6Nevermind.
<SirSprinkles> 6I finally got a decent look at their cutiemarks.
<drf|away> 03*WB02(eXAKR02)03WB* - <eXAKR> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon-Punching bendy buses!
<eXAKR> I just went to have a chat with the Bamboo Tablet
<eXAKR> Let's just say he won't be... living anymore.
<Ghosties> 4There was a thread yesterday concerning a recolor of Pinkie Pie in Cutie Mark Chronicles
<SirSprinkles> 6I did not see that.
<Ghosties> 4Or a pony that had the model of Pinkie, I mean
<Ghosties> 4Show it next, and I'll show you the pony
<SirSprinkles> 6Inkie Pie and Blinkie Pie?
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't have it.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's downloading right now.
<Ghosties> 4Oh yeah, drats
<Ghosties> 4What are the eps showing on Friday? I think The Best Night Ever is one...
<Ghosties> 4Don't remember the other
<Ghosties> 4Oh
<Ghosties> 4Dragonshy
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh... I thought I was on downloading Cutie Mark Chronicles... I'm only on Over a Barrel.
<Mikey> "Big Macintosh says 'Eeyup!'"
<Mikey> I lol'd

<Mikey> yup
<Ghosties> 4Oh well
<Mikey> I saw the schnuffel bunny earlier too and lol'd
<Ghosties> 4You should have them all at by tomorrow, I'd guess
<SirSprinkles> 6I will.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's only 10-20 min to download each ep.
<Ghosties> 4Right
<Lambda> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6lol I love the way Aloe and Lotus look.
<Lambda> have you seen the schnuffel bunny video?
<Lambda> I swear everyone finds it scary, but I think it's adorable
<Lambda> XD
<Mikey> yeah
<Ghosties> 4Wow, they're like twins
<Mikey> hahaha
<Mikey> it is kinda creepy I guess idk I think it's because his SWEEEETEST LOOOOVE is a fucking CARROT
<Lambda> yeah
<Mikey> VEGANS. THEY LOVE THEM CARROTS.
<Lambda> that part is weird
<Lambda> XD
<Mikey> looks like stormy restocked her shop
<Lambda> yep
<Mikey> I bought this puppet thing b/c it was adorable and I just found out it's wearable OMG ;___; <3
<Lambda> she's nearly emptied out her SDB she said

<Mikey> I JUST added it to my pteri :D
<SirSprinkles> 6PONY GAGA
<Lambda> :D
*Lambda goes to look
<Ghosties> 4You know, I wonder how the target demographic (girls) feel about FiM?
<SirSprinkles> 6...that is a very good question.
<Ghosties> 4We need a report
<SirSprinkles> 6I love Photo Finish.
<SirSprinkles> 6We do need a report.
<SirSprinkles> 6...when did Carrot Top get orange hair?
<Ghosties> 4Didn't Rarity say green was an ugly color?
<SirSprinkles> 6True.

<SheenaFox> tell it again
<SirSprinkles> 6It's that I'm downloading.
<SirSprinkles> 6I love that only the vid is lagging.
*SOS_SWEevee hugs all the things eXAKR gave him
*eXAKR throws in the earless bunny
*SOS_SWEevee hugs it too
<SirSprinkles> 6Working now?
<Ghosties> 4It's fine now
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, was just a random GIANT LAG SPURT.
<Ghosties> 4Some lag, but otherwise it's fine
<SirSprinkles> 6Might actually be the vid. I did just dload it and it might have issues.
<Ghosties> 4Hmmm
<SirSprinkles> 6CLOP CLOP CLOP
*SOS_SWEevee gets confuzzled that the rabbit has no ears
<Ghosties> 4Speaking of clopping, hehehe...
<SilverSonic> o3o
<Ghosties> 4WHOA
<Ghosties> 4Dat data
<Ghosties> 4You still have Aladdin Commits Suicide up in the back?
<SirSprinkles> 6I do.
<Ghosties> 4Why?
<SirSprinkles> 6I completely forgot about it.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's closed now.
<Ghosties> 4Oh, okay
<SirSprinkles> 6I was mostly using it to know where to line up the video when VLC derped.
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Mikey> Something Has Happened!
<Mikey> 	You are now eligible to use 'Gormball - Gargarox' as an avatar on the NeoBoards!
<Lambda> :O
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Aurora02)03WB* - <Aurora> 06I acknowledge I have issues, I am ok with it
<Mikey> and this marks my 150th av
<Mikey> :D
<Lambda> what's that av look like?
<Lambda> ooh cool
<Lambda> I have hardly any
<Mikey> it's an ugly grundo muscle dude
<Mikey> but w/e
<Lambda> I really wish I still had my old account
<SirSprinkles> 6This reminds me that I was supposed to feed my sister's cat...
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm sure my dad did it though.
<Mikey> just got the crossword one too
<Ghosties> 4Lol, you might wanna go check
<SOS_SWEevee> so quiet...
<SirSprinkles> 6He did.
<SirSprinkles> 6I texted him.
<Ghosties> 4Cool
<eXAKR> http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/eonity/Whatareyoulookingat.png
<Ghosties> 4RARARA, what are you doing in Nightmare Moon's body?
<SilverSonic> o.o
<SirSprinkles> 6I love how Nightmare Moon glitters.
<Ghosties> 4*GASP*
<SirSprinkles> 6I DID NOT SEE THIS COMING
<Ghosties> 4I AM CRYING TEARS
<SirSprinkles> 6MANLY TEARS
<Ghosties> 4I love how NMM's dark aura makes it look like she has an extra set of wings
<SirSprinkles> 6It's really awesome. XD
<Ghosties> 4And I think Luna is also voiced by Tabitha St. Germain
<SirSprinkles> 6Lulz
<Ghosties> 4Haha, I thought Pinkie was gonna burst out laughing during the sappy moment between Celestia and Luna
<Ghosties> 4When she does that "PFFTTTT"
<SirSprinkles> 6I know. XD
<Ghosties> 4Aha, CM Chronicles is finished
<Ghosties> 4I'll show you Pinkie's recolor
<SirSprinkles> 6Just finished downloading.
<Ghosties> 4Nice
<Ghosties> 4Would you buy a DVD of Season 1 FiM?
<SirSprinkles> 6At this point, likely not.
<SirSprinkles> 6I already have a way to have all the eps.
<SOS_SWEevee> hello
<SirSprinkles> 6So unless it had something AWESOME that came with it.
<IcyNinetales> 2Hello to you too. :3
<SirSprinkles> 6But I am biased by being broke.
<SheenaFox> hello to MYSELF.
<SirSprinkles> 6...WHY MUST LAG?
<SirSprinkles> 6;-;
<Ghosties> 4FIM, Y U LAG
*IcyNinetales 2pounces on SheenaFox and cuddles
<SheenaFox> hi Icy :D
*SOS_SWEevee spreads Silver Wings all over the place
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm going to have to watch all the movies and eps at home in advance to make sure it's not the videos lagging...
<Ghosties> 4Right, well, you might wanna do that tomorrow evening
<SirSprinkles> 6Of course.
<IcyNinetales> 2Sorry I haven't been very active. Had some things going on in my life and by the 20th this month, my activity will be less. :/
<Ghosties> 4I'm gonna call for a meeting tomorrow evening so we can help you out
<Ghosties> 4DCD can probably tell you what he does
<SheenaFox> Awwww, can I ask?
<Mikey> doing that long ass wheel
<SirSprinkles> 6Silly Mexicans, not knowing how to clean floors. XD
<eXAKR> http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/eonity/Together.png >>> http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgozdfeNhA1qh979ko1_500.jpg
<Mikey> hope I get something good
<Mikey> like the avvvv
<Lambda> me too actually
<eXAKR> Spot the goofs in the second picture
<Mikey> or a paint brush or something
<Mikey> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm watching the floor cleaners that come in once a month.
<Lambda> I never get anything good out of it
<Lambda> but I'm always hoping
<Mikey> XD
<IcyNinetales> 2My E.E.G. test that I had last month was to test and see if I've been having seizures. Well, the test came back positive for seizure activity and I will be put on medication to help regulate my epilepsy.
<Ghosties> 4Don't give them any trouble, lol
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not, I'm actually staying out of their way.
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just funny because they OBVIOUSLY have NO idea what they're doing.
<Ghosties> 4You should help them then
<eXAKR> Eeep
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not getting paid, and therefore, nope.
<eXAKR> Stay away from that Pokémon episode
<eXAKR> You know
<eXAKR> That one with flashing lights
<eXAKR> Wait
<IcyNinetales> 2The one called "Electric Soldier Porygon"?
<eXAKR> Just stay away from flashing lights, K?
<eXAKR> Yes
<SirSprinkles> 6I love Fillyshy's emo hair.
<IcyNinetales> 2I only watched it once and it gave me a headache, so I haven't watched it since. In fact, I haven't been watching Pokemon very much at all.
<Ghosties> 4She has it again in the ep with Photo Finish
<SOS_SWEevee> well, what have you been watching lately?
<Ghosties> 4And she actually does look like an emo
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, in the one image.
<IcyNinetales> 2Movies and Animal Planet as well as playing Suikoden.
<Ghosties> 4Angel <3
<Ghosties> 4Aw yeah, here we go
<Ghosties> 4It's coming up
<Ghosties> 4Alright, now, in the flashback sequence for Rarity watch out for a blue pony with curly hair
<Ghosties> 4Here
<Ghosties> 4Her, in the cake
<SOS_SWEevee> Suikoden, huh? I got the first game as a PS1 classic off of PSN a while back, and I enjoyed it. ^w^
<Lambda> mine should be at least close to done
<IcyNinetales> 2I like Suikoden and Crash Team Racing is another game I've been playing as well.
<Mikey> how long has it been going
<Lambda> I started it about two hours ago now
<Mikey> jesus christ
<Lambda> I suppose it sometimes takes three
<SirSprinkles> 6Had to rewind because of the fact that I'm ahead.
<SirSprinkles> 6LAG SO HARD
<Ghosties> 4That's fine
<Ghosties> 4Watch out for her
<Mikey> one time it took literally like
<Mikey> 5 hours
<Lambda> D:
<SirSprinkles> 6I see her.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol Bluie Pie
<Lambda> if it takes tooi much longer I'm just gonna leave it running as I sleep
<Lambda> :P
<Ghosties> 4She really does kinda look like Pinkie
<Ghosties> 4She's Blueberry Pie
<Lambda> I'm getting pretty tired
<Mikey> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6lulz
<Lambda> but dangit I want to see it finish
<Lambda> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Proof that Pinkie's story is a lie?
<Ghosties> 4I HATE MORALS, FUCK THAT BULLSHIT. I NEED TO PUNCH A CACTUS
<SirSprinkles> 6WHAT?
<SOS_SWEevee> That Crash Bandicoot version of Mario Kart is fun, though I've only played a demo of it off of a Playstation Magazine Demo Disk I got years ago (and still have, ironically enough)
*Cqis tickles Aristeo
<Ghosties> 4Scootaloo in regards to "finding yourself" and your cutie mark
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<SirSprinkles> 6Twilight's mom has an amazing mane.
<Ghosties> 4She looks like a previous gen Twilight
<Ghosties> 4See that pony with the cherry on his flank?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Ghosties> 4He appears in present time too
<SirSprinkles> 6Where?
<Ghosties> 4Coming up, after Twi's flashback
<Ghosties> 4In fact, he's there standing next to her
<SirSprinkles> 6Speaking of cacti.
<SOS_SWEevee> any anime lately, Icy?
<Ghosties> 4Haha
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, ENTER DARK PHOENIX MODE.
<Ghosties> 4I CAN SEE FOREVER
<IcyNinetales> 2Not really. Only a few episodes of Inuyasha and Wolf's Rain.
<Ghosties> 4Banished
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL THERE HE IS
<Ghosties> 4Yep
*IcyNinetales 2hums Team Plasma's battle theme
<Ghosties> 4WITH THE EXACT SAME APPEARANCE FROM THE PAST
<SirSprinkles> 6Pinkie makes my comp lag.
<Ghosties> 4He never aged
<Ghosties> 4ever
<Ghosties> 4Him and Derpy literally are time travellers
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh Blinkie Pie and Inkie Pie.
<Ghosties> 4Or Octavia
<Ghosties> 4Since there's this debate on whether or not it actually is her sister from Best Night Ever
<SirSprinkles> 6I doubt it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Coat color and mane color are both different.
<Ghosties> 4People speculate that hair changes color over time
<SirSprinkles> 6Though I could see Octavia being an older sister.
<Ghosties> 4And that's true
<Ghosties> 4AND THAT'S HOW EQUESTRIA WAS MADE
<Ghosties> 4The fuck Pinkie Pie
<Ghosties> 4Seriously
<SirSprinkles> 6We need somepony to tell a story during BMN, so we can go "AND THAT'S HOW BRONYSTATE WAS MADE"
<Ghosties> 4Haha, I can try. I'm a writer, but I don't want to fuck anything up XD
<Mikey> I'm crying http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJo-Dnrv5pU
<Ghosties> 4DERP DASH INCOMING
<Lambda> my speakers aren't working D:
<Lambda> they stop working sometimes
<Mikey> good
<Ghosties> 4OH, I know what would probably convince me to buy a Season 1 DVD of FiM
<Lambda> XD
<Mikey> the sound
<Mikey> is
<SirSprinkles> 6The alt endings to this ep?
<Mikey> satan
<Ghosties> 4Yes
<Lambda> they stop working sometimes and restarting is the only way to get them working again
<Lambda> oh good
<Lambda> I am glad they aren't working then
<Ghosties> 4I would actually really like to see RD on an adventure into the woods to fight some monster
<Ghosties> 4FUCK MORALS
<Lambda> even the visuals are creeping me out
<Mikey> XD
<Ghosties> 4*PUNCHES THE WALL*
<Lambda> oh hey the wheel stopped
*IcyNinetales 2likes Burgh, Brycen, and N from Black/White
<Lambda> I got some weird food
<Mikey> what'd you get
<Mikey> D:
<Ghosties> 4Okay
<Lambda> Evil Blancmage
<Ghosties> 4Well
<Ghosties> 4It's getting late
<Lambda> *Blancmange
<Ghosties> 4I can't stay in this chat forever
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm going soon too.
<SOS_SWEevee> My DS is dead, and I can't find my charger, so my team is stuck in stasis just before the gym battle with Clay...
<SirSprinkles> 6I just need to at least finish this download.
<IcyNinetales> 2Well that sucks. O_o
<SirSprinkles> 6Silly window, that's not what I clicked.
<SOS_SWEevee> But Black/White is still awesome
<SOS_SWEevee> What are thoughs on Rotation Battles?
<Mikey> I feel like going on a pop music binge
<IcyNinetales> 2I like them, but Triple Battles are just as good.
<Lambda> hah
<Lambda> do it
<Lambda> I dare you
<Lambda> :P
<Mikey> perhaps
<Mikey> every few motnsh I'll have a week where I listen to nothing but poppy beats despite my TTLY INDIE HIPSTER R00T$
<eXAKR> o
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> I saw a picture once that showed what foreigners think of the US
<Lambda> and Washington was labelled "Hipsters"
<Mikey> YUP
<SOS_SWEevee> I haven't had a Triple Battle yet, but had a great time in that Rotation Battle with "Heartbreaker Charles"
<Mikey> most the hipsters here reside in capitol hill
<SirSprinkles> 6Or not.
<SirSprinkles> 6Apparently I have to wait an hour before downloading again.
<Mikey> oh that reminds me
<Ghosties> 4FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<Mikey> you know that venue I was trying to find
<SirSprinkles> 6Silly MegaUpload.
<Lambda> yeah
<Mikey> it was like
<Mikey> an old basement
<Ghosties> 4I think you should just go home after Winter finally Wraps up
<Lambda> O.o
<SirSprinkles> 6Sounds like a plan to me.
<Ghosties> 4And continue downloading tomorrow
<Mikey> it was awesome
<Mikey> there were lights hanging down from the ceiling with half of the light bulbs out
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, since I need DCD to help me with the movies anyway.
<Lambda> That's crazy
<Ghosties> 4Yep
<Lambda> haha
<Mikey> and I balanced on a sofa and a mattress to see
<Lambda> XD
<Mikey> I OFFICIALLY HAVE BEEN TO A HIPSTER VENUE
<Mikey> LIKE there were a ton of old bikes n shit
<Ghosties> 4There's an official Keanu Reeves and Agent Smith on Ponychan
<Ghosties> 4Fuck yes
<Mikey> I swear to god one of the staff members must just live there
<Mikey> it was like a house
<SirSprinkles> 6I approve of this.
<Ghosties> 4I definitely approve
<Lambda> that would explain it being so hard to find XD
<Mikey> and the door isn't even labelled or anything there were two doors in this outside room
<NightSeas> 12Hey IcyNinetales
<Ghosties> 4I seriously hope that the guy rping as Smith takes from the first Matrix Smith
<Mikey> then you open the door and there's just a sign that says ALL AGES THAT MEANS NO BEER and a creepy ass dark stairway downstairs
<Mikey> IT WAS COOL THOUGH omg
<IcyNinetales> 2Hi! *waves*
<Lambda> Hahaha
<SirSprinkles> 6Hopefully...
<Ghosties> 4I mean, I love Agent Smith. He's one of my favorite movie villains, but I hated how he kinda de-evolved into a typical "I want to take over the world!" bad guy in the second and third films
<Mikey> and when people were crowdsurfing they were swinging the lightbulbs around
<Ghosties> 4In the first one, he was strictly anonymous, strictly un-emotional, cold, and badass to the core
<Mikey> one min I should find the time on the video I took
<SirSprinkles> 6I am so just setting up a playlist for when I do the stream, that way I don't have to worry about finding the eps/movies.
*NightSeas waves back :3
<Ghosties> 4Sounds good, that way you're organized come Friday night
<Lambda> let me restart first
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
*IcyNinetales 2is currently playing Suikoden
<Lambda> to get my sound working again
<Ghosties> 4Holy shit, you're gonna be streaming Friday night
<Mikey> oh ok you don't need sound though lol
<SirSprinkles> 6I. Know.
<Lambda> oh
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm weirded out by this.
<Mikey> like just to see the lights swinging around
<Ghosties> 4Streaming to possibly over 200 people
<Lambda> well, I feel like listening anyway
<Mikey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaeJ1Db7R84 32:04
<Mikey> alright :P
<Ghosties> 4They will see your every move inside that box
<Lambda> brb
<SirSprinkles> 6This is why I'm setting up a playlist.
<Ghosties> 4We should also go over how you're gonna do the pre-show and post-show
<SirSprinkles> 6And whether the drawing will be Friday or Saturday.
<Ghosties> 4That said, YOU are the streamer for Friday so that probably means, at least for the post-show, that you'll stream whatever you want.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll probably still be taking requests during the post-show.
<Ghosties> 4That sounds reasonable
<Ghosties> 4Just, please, don't show Kamen Rider and sentai THE WHOLE TIME XD
*SOS_SWEevee is on this chat, is on another chat, is eating dinner, and is playing Disgaea 2 PSP ver
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't have Kamen Rider... or Sentai.
<Ghosties> 4Thank god, haha
<SirSprinkles> 6I have DBZ...
<SOS_SWEevee> all at once
<Ghosties> 4I keep trying to get DCD to show Hokuto no Ken
<Ghosties> 4But he keeps pushing it off
<SirSprinkles> 6I might download a bunch of things throughout the week for just in case purposes.
<IcyNinetales> 2Bah! Stupid Windy for attacking Ted and trying to steal his Soul Eater Rune. =_=
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Ghosties> 4There's gonna be a bit to go over next mod meeting
<SOS_SWEevee> i know, right?
<SirSprinkles> 6Which definately has to be tomorrow.
<SirSprinkles> 6Or... later today, rather.
<SOS_SWEevee> What's your party?
<IcyNinetales> 2Tir, Gremio, Cleo, and Pahn now.
<Lambda> back
<Mikey> yay
<Mikey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaeJ1Db7R84 32:35
<Mikey> two people at once
<Mikey> :'D
<SOS_SWEevee> is it a new game?
<Ghosties> 4Pretty much
<SirSprinkles> 6Troll Spike is troll.
<Mikey> oh I thought that was the 2 people clip
<Mikey> guess not
<Mikey> whoops
<IcyNinetales> 2Yep. I level-grinded Tir and Ted to level 11 before I got the Prosperity Rune.
<SOS_SWEevee> nice
<Ghosties> 4Make up your minds -_-
<IcyNinetales> 2Plus, I'm doing money-grinding in order to get new equipment and leveling up my weapons.
<SirSprinkles> 6I love how they show Ditsy Doo in this ep, and people still debate about the idea of Derpy being Ditsy.
<SirSprinkles> 6Especially after Lauren said they were different.
<Lambda> haha, that does look cool
<Mikey> that was a party
<Mikey> I got 2 signatures on the vinyl I got too they were funny
<Mikey> "HEY DO YOU LIKE SHARKS???" "yeah!" "GOOD CAUSE I'M DRAWING YOU A SHARK!!!"
<Mikey> "AND IT LOVES YOU!!!"
<Ghosties> 4She did?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<SirSprinkles> 6A while back.
<Lambda> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6She even said Derpy Hooves when she made the drawing that sold for a ton of money for charity.
<Ghosties> 4Nice
<SOS_SWEevee> do you plan on doing the insane and getting Cleo two Wing Boots?
<Mikey> and the other guy drew a drunk face or something
<SirSprinkles> 6Rewound for proof.
<Mikey> it looks like this (X~~~~~X)
<SirSprinkles> 6Paused on Ditsy.
<IcyNinetales> 2I'll think about it. I'm still a newbie when it comes to Suikoden.
<Lambda> XD
<Bronypeanut> Uh
<SirSprinkles> 6lol Derpy recolor at last minute.
<Bronypeanut> Is anything bad going on
<Ghosties> 4WHOA
<Bronypeanut> / has happened?
<Ghosties> 4BRONYPEANUT HAS ENTERED THE ARENA
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey Peanut.
<Ghosties> 4Is that Ditzy?
<Bronypeanut> So..
<SirSprinkles> 6That's Ditzy.
<Bronypeanut> I'm guessing no?
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Ghosties> 4Bad?
<Ghosties> 4No, why?
<SirSprinkles> 6Nothing bad.
<SOS_SWEevee> it takes a long time that early on to get 'em, but they're the best female accessory for a long time
<Bronypeanut> Because I just finished talking to !!Scootaloo
<Bronypeanut> and he said something about a "Calling all mods" thing, that I apparently was a part of
<Ghosties> 4What's wrong?
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
<Bronypeanut> Was the target for a raid
<Ghosties> 4???
<SirSprinkles> 6...zuh?
<Bronypeanut> So the only thing I could think of was bronystate getting raided
<Ghosties> 4...Ponychan was being raided?
<IcyNinetales> 2*snickers* Family Guy never gets old. X3
<Bronypeanut> No
<Bronypeanut> Well
<SOS_SWEevee> lol
<Bronypeanut> Fuck I have no idea what she was talking about
<SirSprinkles> 6Only thing I can even think of was a stupid post on the Mod Discussion thread that was literally just a bunch of letters.
*IcyNinetales 2will brb. Needs a glass of milk
<SirSprinkles> 6I swiftly reported it...
<Glacymr> 12sigh SilverSonic
<SOS_SWEevee> kk
<SilverSonic> .-.
<Ghosties> 4I remember earlier today when there was a thread on /oat/ where someone as anon was wearing a V for Vendetta mask
<Glacymr> 12wisconsin has some really dumb statistics with alcohol
<SilverSonic> EW
<Bronypeanut> What she gave me was
<Bronypeanut> "Something brony related, not of ponychan, and you posted in the thread."
<Ghosties> 4And it immediately got attention
<SilverSonic> Dont drink kids, its bad for you.
*SilverSonic trollfaces
<Bronypeanut> and something about the target of a raid
*SilverSonic flees
<Bronypeanut> and something about calling of mods
<Glacymr> 12lol
<SirSprinkles> 6How odd...
<Ghosties> 4Bizarre
<SirSprinkles> 6Is there even anything else?
<Bronypeanut> ....................Nope
<SirSprinkles> 6When/where did she tell you this?
<Bronypeanut> Other than the fact that she decided to look through my post history
<SOS_SWEevee> ...random!
<Bronypeanut> Right now
<Bronypeanut> I'm talking to her on steam
<SirSprinkles> 6Odd.
<SirSprinkles> 6Could you ask her to be a bit more... specific?
<Ghosties> 4Okay, seriously, does EVERYONE have the mods on tap?!
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't.
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't know any of them.
<Ghosties> 4It's like everywhere I turn it's "Oh, Scoots and I are friends on Steam" or "Yeah, I totally have a cool relationship with Spike on XBL"
<Ghosties> 4I don't meant to harp on anyone, especially you, Peanut, but it befuddles me so much :S
<SirSprinkles> 6I see Spike in the GET threads, but he doesn't really talk to me...
<Bronypeanut> Okay
<Bronypeanut> Do one of you
<Bronypeanut> have the mod thread
<Bronypeanut> for BMN
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Ghosties> 4Uh
<SirSprinkles> 6One moment.

*IcyNinetales 2is back
<SirSprinkles> 6There was a spam post in the thread earlier.
<SirSprinkles> 6I reported it almost immediately.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was just letters, really.
<Bronypeanut> ...................
<Bronypeanut> "Mmh! Hey, there it is. "
<Bronypeanut> *facepalm*
<SirSprinkles> 6...?
<Bronypeanut> Also
<Ghosties> 4I'm so fucking confused right now >_<

<SirSprinkles> 6So... what's going on?
<Ghosties> 4...it just befuddles me so
<SilverSonic> welcome back.

<NightSeas> 12Good night, everyone
<Bronypeanut> Wake up. Get food. log onto ponychan.
<IcyNinetales> 2Good night!
<Bronypeanut> Mfw there's a raid. Shit.
<Bronypeanut> Call other mods in.
<Bronypeanut> : Report of a post in this thread, which is a trollpost. An ICP
<Bronypeanut> Notice thread seems to be of interest. Intend to keep tab open to read later.
<Bronypeanut> Raid increases. Close a lot of tabs to better focus on task at hand.
<Bronypeanut> Thread is gone. FUUUUUUUUUUUUU.
<Bronypeanut> : I saw Peanut's name in it. he can help me!
<Ghosties> 4Did they successfully manage to parasprite anyone?
<Lambda> it is raining like crazy here
<Bronypeanut> "Peanut, this thing happened, I need your help!"
<Mikey> same here
<Mikey> SUMMER FUN
<SirSprinkles> 6...XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Wow.
<Lambda> it's gonna be nice falling asleep to this though
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm so glad I'm the one who reported that spam post earlier.
<Ghosties> 4I'm kinda glad I wasn't around now. But did anyone get successfully parasprited?
<Mikey> dat global warming
<Lambda> Haha
<Mikey> IT SURE IS WARM OUT HERE, A WHOLE 48 DEGREES!!!
<Mikey> WE'RE ALL DOOMED
<Lambda> :P
*IcyNinetales 2goes back to playing Suikoden
<Mikey> honestly I'm sick of this weather menopause shit
<Lambda> you mean how one day it's beautiful out and the nxt it's storming?
<Mikey> yep
<Lambda> Yeah me too
<Lambda> I wish it would stay sunny
<Mikey> it's terrible too because the weather pressure changing makes my mom feel sick so she can't be comortable when the weather acts this way
<Mikey> me too
<Lambda> for more than one day
<Ghosties> 4And what thread in particular was it, Peanut?
<SirSprinkles> 6In the reason box, I typed "...do I even have to give a reason for this stupidity?"
<BlazingStarshine> Oh hey. This is irc.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey BlazingStarshine
<BlazingStarshine> Hi.
<BlazingStarshine> What server is this? I'll connect through a real client, no the webchat.
<Bronypeanut> *shrug*
<SirSprinkles> 6One second.
<SirSprinkles> 6You can use irc.irchighway.net
<SirSprinkles> 6Channel is #BronyState
<Lambda> oh no, I didn't know that
<Lambda> that's not good
<SirSprinkles> 6So, yeah... problem solved, I guess?
<Lambda> now I want the weather to stay nice evn more
<Mikey> mhm
<Bronypeanut> Well
<Bronypeanut> Maybe.
<BlazingStarshine> There we are.,
<Mikey> like I don't even need it to be 90 degrees but 70's or 80's would be nice
<Bronypeanut> Apparently.. something about a raid.
<Lambda> yeah I agree
<Mikey> honestly it's JUNE I'm sick of this rain
<Lambda> 70s and 80s are perfect for me
<Lambda> I know
<BlazingStarshine> So then! Hi.
<SirSprinkles> 6Raid of ponychan earlier, maybe? I dunno.
<Lambda> they should've stopped in April
<SirSprinkles> 6Hi!
<Mikey> april showers bring june showers
<Lambda> Haha
<Bronypeanut> 0But yeah
<SirSprinkles> 6Hello, test
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<BlazingStarshine> Eheh. No, that's me seeing something.
<BlazingStarshine> Mfw hmasks don't change on mibbit.
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<Lambda> Or Mother Nature comes around and "hurr durr what month is it again? oh well, I'll just roll a dice and if it's odd the weather will be shit today"
<BlazingStarshine> There goes that idea.
<Mikey> YEP
<BlazingStarshine> That test is a spy.
<Ghosties> 4Oh, Peanut, we made Sprinkles a full op
<SirSprinkles> 6We can see your hostname though, so we know that it's one person.
<BlazingStarshine> So. SirSprinkles.
<Bronypeanut> 0Congrats Sprinkles =D
<BlazingStarshine> Any relation to SgtSprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> 6None whatsoever.
<Ghosties> 4I was curious about that myself, actually
<SirSprinkles> 6I get asked that a lot.
<BlazingStarshine> Well, considering SgtSprinkles is a ban-on-sight name?
<BlazingStarshine> Yeh~
<Ghosties> 4It would be interesting if the notorious writer of Cupcakes really WAS underneath our noses this whole time
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<BlazingStarshine> I doubt that.
<SilverSonic> Night All
*SilverSonic sleeps
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, my old name in the internet got me mixed up with the writer of Half-Life 2: Full-Life Consequences.
<SirSprinkles> 6Since that's SquirrelKing
<BlazingStarshine> /nick BlazingSprinkles
<BlazingStarshine> haha. :p
<Glacymr> 12noooooooooooooo
<Lambda> oh I just realized
<Bronypeanut> 0You really need to find more less obscure names Sprinkles
<Lambda> I'm at 100 posts on SF finally
<Lambda> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6I do.
<Mikey> well, I should really go @___@;
<Mikey> 100 POSTS
<BlazingStarshine> Mfw I used to be the only Starshine.
<Ghosties> 4Don't change your current Brony name though, man
<BlazingStarshine> Now there's 3 others.
<Lambda> I should too
<Mikey> IT'S A LANDMARK ON SF HISTORY
<Lambda> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6I don't plan on it.
<Ghosties> 4I am comfortable calling you Sprinkles
<Lambda> it is for me
<Bronypeanut> 0I'm the only Peanut
<Bronypeanut> 0=D
<Ghosties> 4Or Sprinks for short :P
<SirSprinkles> 6This is actually the only place I use Sprinkles...
<Mikey> XD
<Mikey> gnite
<SOS_SWEevee> ???
<Lambda> See ya
<BlazingStarshine> /nick BlazingPeanut.
<Bronypeanut> 0Ohgod!
<Bronypeanut> 0Nooooooooooooooo
<BlazingStarshine> 8D
<SirSprinkles> 6I use creativename a lot...
<SOS_SWEevee> g'night SilverSonic from a Silver-Winged Eevee
<BlazingStarshine> Oh good, this server has a nickserv.
<SirSprinkles> 6It does.
<BlazingStarshine> So does the server where I host the Pony Raid Shelter.
<SOS_SWEevee> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Bronypeanut> 0Pony Raid Shelter?
<BlazingStarshine> yeah..
<Bronypeanut> 0I..
<BlazingStarshine> Back when Derpy chat was the place to go, I noticed it was getting raided a lot.
<BlazingStarshine> Soo, I made a secure, secret Pony Raid Shelter.
<Bronypeanut> 0Oh
<BlazingStarshine> Being that it's IRC, it's controllable.
<Bronypeanut> 0I never went to derpy chat
<Bronypeanut> 0xD
<BlazingStarshine> +m, voice, etc.
<BlazingStarshine> So even if it got leaked.. and raided..
<SirSprinkles> 6I never herd of derpy chat
<BlazingStarshine> Reguler users were protect.
<Bronypeanut> 0All I know is /kick
<BlazingStarshine> ed
<Bronypeanut> 0cause that's all I ever use
<SirSprinkles> 6I know a lot of the commands.
<eXAKR> !glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to eXAKR for 17 minutes
<BlazingStarshine> I've been using irc since before I was 16. D:
<Bronypeanut> 0I'm a newfoal at this
<Bronypeanut> 0xD
<BlazingStarshine> Ah heh.
<SirSprinkles> 6I just recently picked up IRC, I just do my research.
<Glacymr> 12noooo
<SirSprinkles> 6It's fairly simple.
<BlazingStarshine> And secure.
<Bronypeanut> 0Honestly the last person I kicked was yelling at us calling us names for picking Starship Troopers as a Bad movie
<SirSprinkles> 6The only pain in the neck thing is scripts.
<BlazingStarshine> Especially considering the hmask.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, very secure.
<BlazingStarshine> It's a horrible movie. xD
<BlazingStarshine> I love it.
<BlazingStarshine> but it's horrible.
<BlazingStarshine> Mfw I have the games.
<SirSprinkles> 6>us
<SirSprinkles> 6>picking movie
<Ghosties> 4FUCK YOU STARSHIP TROOPERS IS AN A MOVIE
<Ghosties> 4Rinse and repeat'
<Ghosties> 4about five or six times
<BlazingStarshine> 7So what's going on tonight?
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh yeah, that was picked by you, wasn't it Peanut?
<SirSprinkles> 6Nothing tonight.
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, it was picked by Peanut
<Bronypeanut> 0yeah
<Bronypeanut> 0I came in at the last second
<SirSprinkles> 6You actually just missed me practice streaming.
<Ghosties> 4He was gonna go with DBZ Evolution but decided against it
<Bronypeanut> 0and was like
<Bronypeanut> 0"I R HERE
<BlazingStarshine> -sighs-
<BlazingStarshine> According to my workschedule..
<BlazingStarshine> I don't get to come.
<SirSprinkles> 6I love how the past two weeks the B movie has been picked by a BMN mod.
<Ghosties> 4Why not, Star?
<BlazingStarshine> 3pm to 11pm.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's okay, we'll be doing a reshowing on Saturday.
<SirSprinkles> 6At 2 PM EST
<Ghosties> 4Actually Sprinks, I also got to pick the b movie three weeks ago ^_^
<SOS_SWEevee> all your Glacymr are belong to eXAKR
<Bronypeanut> 0We're doing reshowings now?
<SirSprinkles> 6...XD
<Glacymr> 12lies
<Bronypeanut> 0Wow I am terrible at keeping up with you guys
<SirSprinkles> 6But did you show up at the last second, Ghosties?
<eXAKR> truth
<SirSprinkles> 6Like Silver and Peanut did?
<eXAKR> and veritas
<Ghosties> 4Nope
<BlazingStarshine> O sheeit.
<BlazingStarshine> I have Saturday off.
<Ghosties> 4I kept a very close eye on the thread
<BlazingStarshine> But it won't be the same.
<Ghosties> 4So when I was chosen, I was fucking ecstatic
<SirSprinkles> 6It was just decided today, Peanut.
<SOS_SWEevee> c ya, Icy?
<SirSprinkles> 6Since I can stream, and will be on on Saturdays anyway.
<BlazingStarshine> I need to speak with an IRC pro that I can trust with classified informations.
<SirSprinkles> 6We figured it would be nice for the Eurobronies and those that would miss the movie night for other reasons.
<Ghosties> 4The main reason why we're streaming on Saturdays at 2 PM EST is for the Euro bronies who are hours behind the U.S.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hours ahead.
<SirSprinkles> 6 5 hours ahead.
<Ghosties> 4I swore I put "ahead." Damn, my mind is shot right now >_<
<SirSprinkles> 6Your head is full of ponies?
<Bronypeanut> 0Hmm
<Bronypeanut> 0Okay
<Bronypeanut> 0So Imma have to show up for that too
<Bronypeanut> 0right?
<Ghosties> 4My head is full of Agalloch right now
<SirSprinkles> 6It would be nice, Peanut. Especially for the first few weeks.
<SirSprinkles> 6But we are looking for more Euromods.
<SOS_SWEevee> well, I'm gonna turn in for the night too. G'night, all!
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, Hip and the others are hoping that we'll show up for it. We don't have to, but they would be very thankful if we did
<Bronypeanut> 0I see.
<Bronypeanut> 0Alright I'll do my best
<Bronypeanut> 0to be there
<Bronypeanut> 0Oh
<Bronypeanut> 0Shit
<Bronypeanut> 0......................................................
<Bronypeanut> 0AND THEN I REMEMBERED
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Ghosties> 4I'll definitely be honest though and let you guys know ahead of time that I probably won't be modding the chat on Saturdays as well
<SirSprinkles> 6At first I was like, "Okay", and then I REMEMBERED THE FUCK UP
<Ghosties> 4At least, not every Saturday
<Ghosties> 4Haha, Sprinks
<SirSprinkles> 6It's cool, Ghosties
<Bronypeanut> 0My friend is having a birthday and wants me to come along
<BlazingStarshine> OH SHEEIT.
<SirSprinkles> 6That's why we're looking for Eurobronies
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll pick some out after a couple of weeks and put them on a trial period, sounds good, yes?
<Ghosties> 4Maybe we could have like mods taking turn to help mod Saturdays
<SirSprinkles> 6That would be most fair until then, yeah.
<Bronypeanut> 0and now before bafflejack gets any angrier at me and starts sending more assassins after me
<Bronypeanut> 0Brb.
<SirSprinkles> 6Have fun Peanut!
<Ghosties> 4Have fun man
<SirSprinkles> 6I keep forgetting to sign up for that game.
<SirSprinkles> 6They'd never kill me.
<Ghosties> 4I thought about it, but decided against it
<SirSprinkles> 6I post in like, 4 threads.
<SirSprinkles> 6All of them are "official"
<Ghosties> 4I know that I was the very first recruit to sign up for the Assassin game that became popular
<SirSprinkles> 6They wouldn't be allowed to attack me in them.
<Bronypeanut> 0They'll attack you up to page 15
<BlazingStarshine> Wait, what's happening?
<Bronypeanut> 0You.. Don't know about the Assassin game?
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a silly ponychan game.
<BlazingStarshine> Not fully.
<Ghosties> 4If you sign up in a particular thread, every night, the TC will pick someone to "assassinate"
<BlazingStarshine> Do they play favorites?
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Damos02)03WB* - <Nightshadow|VNC> Damos, you will mate with Articuno!
<Ghosties> 4And I think it's if you don't respond to their attack in time, they you die
<Ghosties> 4*then you die
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, as a GETter, I take pride in my ability to watch all of /oat/ at once.
<Bronypeanut> 0Nah they don't
<Bronypeanut> 0Well maybe
<Bronypeanut> 0Not entirely
<BlazingStarshine> I seem to remember them all attacking you at once, Bronypeanut.
<BlazingStarshine> Several times.
<BlazingStarshine> in an overkill manner.
<Bronypeanut> 0They constantly harass me.
<BlazingStarshine> Maybe they should be harassed back.
<SirSprinkles> 6They made that rule about not helping eachother because I would find each of their attacks, and post in the mane thread within 4 posts. XD
<BlazingStarshine> By the only roleplayer ever to have absorbed 3.5 mods!
<Bronypeanut> 0what's the .5?
<BlazingStarshine> Spike said no, use Twilight instead.
<Bronypeanut> 0Oh
<SirSprinkles> 6...lawl
<BlazingStarshine> So instead of getting just his firebreath and scale armor, I got his narcalepsy too.
<Ascendant> o-o
<Bronypeanut> 0Well You, Spike, and Rainbow are the only mods I can really contact in a reasonable amount of time.
<Bronypeanut> 0-.-~
<BlazingStarshine> Watchu talkin' 'bout?
<Bronypeanut> 0Nothing.
<Archfiend> ohai
<SirSprinkles> 6And then the chat was DEAD.
<Bronypeanut> 0No it wasn't
<Bronypeanut> 0Liar
<BlazingStarshine> I keldeo'd it.
<SirSprinkles> 6...dat pun
<SirSprinkles> 6Shut up and take my internets!
<BlazingStarshine> You know that image of spike..
<BlazingStarshine> Shutup and take my money!
<BlazingStarshine> That was legitimately used on me once.
<BlazingStarshine> During the whole Operation: Ponies for Bronies.
<SirSprinkles> 6I had an OC made about me yesterday.
<Archfiend> Hm
<SirSprinkles> 6http://www.ponychan.net/chan/chat/src/130802168927.png
*Archfiend goes to back up flame's services
<BlazingStarshine> People were sending me money without ordering ponies.
<Archfiend> in case shit goes down
<BlazingStarshine> I told them to stop.
<BlazingStarshine> That pic was posted.
<BlazingStarshine> Everyone giggled.
<SirSprinkles> 6...lol wut?
<BlazingStarshine> mfw you don't lissen to my stories.
<BlazingStarshine> IT'S :c
<SirSprinkles> 6I was listening.
<SirSprinkles> 6The fact that they sent you money without ordering was what the "...lol wut?" was directed at.
<BlazingStarshine> oic~
<Bronypeanut> 13Nyan
<Bronypeanut> 13I have pink text
<SirSprinkles> 6...I need to clean out my image folders.
<SirSprinkles> 6The one time I need to find my image of Apple Bloom and Scootaloo with no Sweetie Belle, can't find it.
<Bronypeanut> 13I only use 1 image of Scootaloo
<Bronypeanut> 13And it's the "I'll make a more perfect world"
<BlazingStarshine> I USE MANY IMAGES OF SCOOTALOO LOLOL.
<BlazingStarshine> =|
<Bronypeanut> 13Scoot scoot scootaloo~
<SirSprinkles> 6I have a lot of Scootaloo, but that's mostly due to having a lot of Apple Bloom.
<Bronypeanut> 13All I use is Derpy now
<ScriptBot> !chatstats
<Cone> Chat stats updating.
<Bronypeanut> 13Prefferably
<Bronypeanut> 13http://img.tymoon.eu/?p=bronies/derpy/mfws
<Bronypeanut> 13any of those
<Ghosties> 4Wait
<Ghosties> 4So is BlazingStarshine !!Scootaloo on Ponychan?
<SirSprinkles> 6...
<Ghosties> 4It's 3:51 in the morning, shutup
<BlazingStarshine> What's ponychan?
<SirSprinkles> 6I didn't say anything, Ghosties.
<SirSprinkles> 6:p
<Ghosties> 4So then that's a no
<Bronypeanut> 13Starshine is a new brony
<Ghosties> 4Bronypeanut specifically said "Well You, Spike, and Rainbow are the only mods I can really contact in a reasonable amount of time." What does this mean?
<Bronypeanut> 13Nothing at all
<BlazingStarshine> I spy for Scootaloo.
<Ghosties> 4You lie, sir
<BlazingStarshine> I'M REPORTING TO HER RIGHT NOW.
<Ghosties> 4I WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS
<Bronypeanut> 13*Pokerface*
<Ghosties> 4...Seriously, I feel so fucking confused T_T
<BlazingStarshine> I thought that perhaps I could re-join the community as myself.
<BlazingStarshine> I see now that's impossible.
<BlazingStarshine> I'll let you in on a little secret.
<BlazingStarshine> I'll ban you harder than I would hitlar if you leak things.
<Ghosties> 4I knew it
<Ghosties> 4SUCCESS
<Ghosties> 4Don't worry
<BlazingStarshine> No. Not success.
<SirSprinkles> 6Leak what?
<BlazingStarshine> if too many people know I'm going to get de-modded.
<BlazingStarshine> I don't know why everyone has an obsession with knowing who mods are.
<BlazingStarshine> it makes us lose our rank.
<Bronypeanut> 13That's why I was confusing you
<Bronypeanut> 13but
<Ghosties> 4Look, don't worry about it. I'm not gonna rave to the imageboard "LOL I KNOW !!SCOOTALOO HERP"
<Bronypeanut> 13Whelp.
<BlazingStarshine> I already derp'd here a few times myself.
<SirSprinkles> 6>mfw people having obsession over knowing who mods are
<SirSprinkles> 6:/
<BlazingStarshine> nothing going, might as well forget being myself ever again.
<SirSprinkles> 6...aww.
<SirSprinkles> 6I liked the other name better.
<Ghosties> 4I feel like I upset you, or offended you. I seriously did not mean to
<Bronypeanut> 13Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrddddddddddddd
<SirSprinkles> 6...your face is awkward.
<ScootalooMOD> Because I was BlazingStarshine since February.
<ScootalooMOD> No one knows who the fuck I am anymore. And no one knows me as me.
<ScootalooMOD> As a mod, I have to watch every little thing I do.
<Ghosties> 4If you're so unhappy about all this, then why not just hang up the position like Cheerilee did?
<ScootalooMOD> Every little mistake is recorded and logged, to be thrown back in my face at a later date.
<ScootalooMOD> I'm not unhappy about being a mod.
<SirSprinkles> 6What, I'm not allowed to joke all of the sudden to break the awkward silence?
<Bronypeanut> 13It was about my face
<Bronypeanut> 13*tear*
<Ghosties> 4Well, it seems like you're facing a personal issue with your position.
<SirSprinkles> 6I never said it was your face.
<SirSprinkles> 6There are other people here.
<SirSprinkles> 6It could have been about dari, for all you know.
<ScootalooMOD> You're misunderstanding.
<ScootalooMOD> but fine~
<Ghosties> 4Sure, take it out on dari the poor chatroom
<SirSprinkles> 6Yay!
<BlazingStarshine> Also; you all done been trolled lolol.
<BlazingStarshine> Anyone can say they're a mod. :p
<Ghosties> 4Okay, it's 4 in the morning
<BlazingStarshine> Yeah. I work nights.
<BlazingStarshine> i was bored.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol
<SirSprinkles> 6To be fair, we don't even know you're the real BlazingStarshine
<SirSprinkles> 6And to be even more fair, I didn't really care in the first place.
<Bronypeanut> 13lol
<SirSprinkles> 6<SirSprinkles>: >mfw people having obsession over knowing who mods are <SirSprinkles>:
<SirSprinkles> 6lol emoticon didn't post.
<Ghosties> 4To be honest, at this point, I don't give a fuck
<Bronypeanut> 13Exactly
<Bronypeanut> 13Do that
<BlazingStarshine> implying BlazingStarshine is real~
<BlazingStarshine> Wait.
<Bronypeanut> 13Wat
<Ghosties> 4Okay, I feel like people are being abrasive and apprehensive
<SirSprinkles> 6I have seen a poster by the name of BlazingStar!shine or whatever.
<SirSprinkles> 6So, yeah.
