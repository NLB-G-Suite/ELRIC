<RDash5000> :[ RAWR
<Polydunami> :O
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome|Homework: me too /) though i played a different version
<Garrus_Vakarian> I recentley did a brawl tournament with 3 friends and 28 cpus and I waiting for him to put it up on the youtube, I won with Ike
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d4taahq
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah fake news is fake
<RDash5000> ike is the best'\
<prince-dari> Eh, I didn't really bother with Skylanders because I thought the toy thing was a bit gimmicky, and just a way to squeeze money, and I didn't like how Spyro looked
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: Ike is kinda cheap.
<Cades> Yeah, that pretty much sums it up
<Dark92Enigma> dooooooooooooooooodge
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<SuperBrony64> 11,02gg :)
<Garrus_Vakarian> Not really, He is really slow and has no range,
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I can tell you this, the game IS getting an HD release.
<Dark92Enigma> nopony got the DBZ abridged reference
<Kimori> yeah obviously spyro is different
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> However, I don't know when.
<fluttershyFTW> DERPY NOOOOOOOO
<RDash5000> use IKE
<Kimori> But what I think is that if he didnt end up in the game he never wouldive been revived
<fluttershyFTW> i love using lucario
<Derpy_Hooves> now its gonna get guud
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|Homework, you mean a port like they did with every other sega game?
<FUS_RO_yay> Its been over what, 5 years now? I dont think this game is getting a hd remake
<Kimori> When I bought skylanders stuff I only bought it when it was on sale
<RDash5000> lucario is also great
<fluttershyFTW> espicialy his ranged attacks
<CrimsonPhoenix> where the HD is barely HD
*Dark92Enigma My custom player would say: I'm the Nostalgia Critic, i remember it, so you don't have to
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Well, I don't mind ports.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but just HR
<Garrus_Vakarian> FUS_RO_yay: Not really, Ike is very slow and has no range attacks, he can easily be beaten by any of the star fox trio or other fast range characters
<prince-dari> Meh, fair enuogh
<prince-dari> enough*
<Dark92Enigma> FINAL DESTINATION!
<twilight_sprinkle> dayum, derpy is back with a vengeance
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: Touche.
<Garrus_Vakarian> jerkin the gerkin

*Ponies47 Does the ammer on Dark92Enigma's head
<FUS_RO_yay> pffffft
<Ponies47> *Hammer
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47: i don't regret anything :D
<Garrus_Vakarian> FUS_RO_yay: Actually One of my friends was using wolf and I got really salty, It was close but he got greedy and turned his back to get the smash ball, so I sent his ass flying
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I don't use the smash ball anymore.
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: Nice.
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: But when in doubt, use SNAKE
<fluttershyFTW> lol

<fluttershyFTW> chat derped out on me
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome|Homework: I WAS ABOUT.....to do a Zelda reference, one from Link, if you will
<Garrus_Vakarian> FUS_RO_yay: I've played as him before, I just don't like his move pool that much. Probs because I'm used to play as swordsmen.
<RDash5000> MGS4
<SirGanjalf> g'night everypony
<Garrus_Vakarian> playing*
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Although his entrance in adventure mode was utter crap.

<Saturn> 08,01dead princess celestia, i'm so hydrated.
<Saturn> 08,01*dear
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: I dont blame you, but he is strong, fast, and ranged. Thats pretty damn good for a character.
<twilight_sprinkle> dead :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> dead princess celestia
<Saturn> 08,01dat dead
<CrimsonPhoenix> best intro
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Dark92Enigma: Well, EXCUSEEEEEE ME, princess.

<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome|Homework: EEEEEEYUP, never gets old
<RDash5000> DED
<CrimsonPhoenix> deal princess celestia
<CrimsonPhoenix> deal with it
<twilight_sprinkle> kamon derpy
<CrimsonPhoenix> your faithful student
<CrimsonPhoenix> Twilight Sporkle
<Garrus_Vakarian> FUS_RO_yay: He is a good character but I've always been good playing against him, I don't think I've ever lost a match of smash to someone playing as snake.
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Kandarihu> They're just spamming randomizers, heh
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I actually used to destroy my brothers with Mario.
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Garrus_Vakarian> Dat randomizer
<RoboGerbil> would a twilight sporkle have a cutie mark like silver spoons?
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: Probably because most people who use snake are noobs and dont know how to use him. He has a lot of more potential than what people use him for.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Mario may be an all around character, but once you know how to utilize him he is VERY hard to kill.
<fluttershyFTW> damm ad
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome|Homework: i used Mario and Kirby the most........gotta have the game back, i guess i owe Link the respect he deserves......
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I miss the Mario Tornado move in this game, though. Too bad they replaced it with.......FLUDD. :|
<cachi01|phone> Uhmmmm......im not going to /b/ again
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|Homework, Flash Liqudizer Ultra Dousing Device
<ASoftFluffyThing> cachi01|phone: Why would you go there in the first place?
<Garrus_Vakarian> FUS_RO_yay:Yeah because snake is one of those characters that you can't just pick up and be good with like link, you need to perfect his move pool to be effective
<Dken2021> Jigglypuff's also a brutal character, only drawback is she's lightweighted so it's easy to knock her out
<Kimori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjiObmXtuGg
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> It's an air attack move, but it's not the same. :(
<cachi01|phone> ASoftFluffyThing to be honest.... Idfk
<soulrider95> Jigglypuff is the best :D
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome|Homework: correction: i used Kirby, Pikachu and Mario the most, in that order
<ASoftFluffyThing> cachi01|phone: Oh god
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, you're awesome
<StinkomanFan> LA LA LA
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> My brother and I used to duke it out with Captain Falcon and Mario. :D
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: Actually, i suck ass with link xD
<Saturn> 08,01i want to be a lesbian
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: Thanks :)
<cachi01|phone> I want to be a tree
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> We never played any other mode besides Stock.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, can we be lesbian together?
<fluttershyFTW> me and my cousins would go on a four on four free for all
<Dark92Enigma> I'd like to be a :(
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: and now you kick him in the nuts?
<fluttershyFTW> im usually lucario
<Dken2021> music get!
<Garrus_Vakarian> FUS_RO_yay: That's weird because I started playing off as link when I had The original smash and I use him up to this day, his move pool is simple but effective
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn: Uh...okay?
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: LOLWUT
<fluttershyFTW> wubba dub dub
<Saturn> 08,01okay, it's official
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: I just cant seem to get any combos in then i get knocked out.

<Dken2021> finished with a 9, deadly
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also guys you all know how we play smash right?
<Garrus_Vakarian> FUS_RO_yay: Yeah that's the problem with some swordsmen they are a bit chunky so you can't really pull off many combos, the only good combo swordsmen is marth.
<fluttershyFTW> in thw wii i can play it
<fluttershyFTW> the*
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: smash?
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: Im actually decent with Marth
<CrimsonPhoenix> Super Smash bros of course
<CrimsonPhoenix> in general
<Derpy_Hooves> joke match
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> There's a SSB tournament at the campus.
<Garrus_Vakarian> FUS_RO_yay: If you can get someone in the air with marth they are done, he is an arieal combat master
<fluttershyFTW> derpy use lucario
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> *my campus

<pony14662> Bullshit I identified for my nick
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: Yeah, same type of thing with snake.
<fluttershyFTW> wow..

<Reikim|DED> Hm
<Reikim|DED> Better
<Dken2021> ello there Reikim
<CrimsonPhoenix> p4ngya, that's the joke
<fluttershyFTW> who's sgb4
<Reikim|GW2> Hm
<Reikim|GW2> It still won't let me use my base nick but whatever
<CrimsonPhoenix> if you played League of Legends you would find it insulting trust me
<Meanwhile> Twisted Fate rocks your ganks.
<Reikim|GW2> Anyway going to go boot up my Wii~ Also hi NewSuperBronyU!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hai :3
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Garrus_Vakarian> FUS_RO_yay: I like to players that stick to the ground, link is good on the ground but if he is in mid air hes not tottaly screwed, but If you get put in the air as Ike you only have aether to save you
<cachi01|phone> Sagnip
<CrimsonPhoenix> Garrus_Vakarian, I'll have Toon Link
<cachi01|phone> Toon sagnip
<fluttershyFTW> i like using ranged moves
<cachi01|phone> Ranged sagnip
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: I can usually weasel my way out of situations like that with ike, just go to the way where there are less people and try to land.
<Dken2021> I'm still a bit ticked I lost to someone using Ike during a semifinal
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Wallpaper Compilation #66
<twilight_sprinkle> oh, a wallpaper compilation
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> I also used to master Marth. LOVE the shield breaker.
<cachi01|phone> I liek ike
<cachi01|phone> I always use ike...
<Garrus_Vakarian> CrimsonPhoenix: Yeah I like toon link he's a real balanced character
<CrimsonPhoenix> He's speedy
<XylemTube> What am I watching, why are they only using the one move?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and floaty
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> That's probably the main drawback for me about brawl.
<fluttershyFTW> i use either fox or lucario
<CrimsonPhoenix> also there's no balance in Brawl
<cachi01|phone> Dken2021 i was using ike and i lost in the first freaking round of the tournament :/
<Garrus_Vakarian> FUS_RO_yay: Yeah if your playing on a medium sized map but me and my friends prefer final destination and battle ground
<FUS_RO_yay> Garrus_Vakarian: Either way, i usally can pull it off. Usually.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Garrus_Vakarian, NO ITEM, FOX ONLY, FINAL DESTINATION
<fluttershyFTW> i hate battleground but i like final destination
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> If only the Gamecube LAN device was compatible with Melee. :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> Only way to play Super Smash Brothers
<Derpy_Hooves> lawl
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02lol
<CCCP> i like Pirate Ship
<Meanwhile> Wombo combo.
<Garrus_Vakarian> CrimsonPhoenix: THATS TEH WAY CHAMPIONS PLAY :[
<fluttershyFTW> i forgot that one map where the lava rises up
<CrimsonPhoenix> Garrus_Vakarian, that's the way it should be played
<CCCP> am i the only one that relly likes items? there the only way i can win
<CrimsonPhoenix> anything else is purely hazard and doesn't show any skill
<CrimsonPhoenix> but random luck
<FUS_RO_yay> We are the champions, we are the champions, no tiem for lozerz, cuz we be teh championz, of teh worllllllddd
<Garrus_Vakarian> CrimsonPhoenix: THIS PONIES GOT THE RIGHT IDEA! :[

<Buytoast> whats happening
<pony34507> so hows the sream
<Phase4> Shizuka, nextstep, microkernel something or other

<pony34507> wait what
<cachi01|phone> Fail
<Polydunami> As in, /nick fluttershyloves
<AdamTheDuck> No stream at the moment? :/

<cachi01|phone> Eenope
<AJIsAwesome> nope
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, just do /nick twilightisbestponi

<AJIsAwesome> NOPE.AVI
<Phase4> infact theres a full gnu environment on the default osx install
<Shizuka> 13windows why your command prompt suck so much
<pony34507> whos flutterloves?
<cachi01|phone> Or do /nick obvious_troll

<Shizuka> 13pony34507: that would be you genius, or should i just ban you for trolling?
<AdamTheDuck> Ooh a troll, can I hug it?
<Phase4> Shizuka, they quote powershell as an improvment
<Dovah> oooh a troll, can i kill it?
<cachi01|phone> 5$ and you can see it
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: yes
<pony34507> :'( im sorry ok?
<Dovah> I need Troll fat.
<Reikim> To be fair, the average user has absolutely nothing to do with the command line.
<Shizuka> 13protip, if you're going to sneak in and out with different nicks, don't use the same username and hostmask every time
<Shizuka> 13it's a bit of a giveaway
<Shizuka> 13powershell suuuuuuuuuucks
*AdamTheDuck hugs pony34507... Then violently stabs it with a rusty kitchen knife.
<Reikim> Or that.
<Phase4> but its not a command line, its a .net language thats too complicated to function as shell scripts thats also impractical as an actual language
<AJIsAwesome> XD
<AdamTheDuck> ._.
<Shizuka> 13at least the window itself, it's just cmd.exe plus color
<twilight_sprinkle> D:
<Phase4> so its a tool for no one
<Dovah> ^
*DashWithRainbows slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka i doubt he/she knows what a hostmask is
<DashWithRainbows> Bad.
<pony34507> why what did i do to you
<Dovah> I like AdamTheDuck now, alot
<Polydunami> pony34507, welcome to Bronystate :P
<cachi01|phone> erhmaherd lurg truts r mah faverite

<pony34507> ok
<ASoftFluffyThing> AdamTheDuck, wat
<Shizuka> 13lame trixie... imma submit an RFC to require a quiz before you connect using IRC
<AdamTheDuck> Too much American McGee's Alice... :D
<Shizuka> 13that too
<Phase4> plus it takes ages to start as it has to load all of .net and jit itself
<Reikim> So MS is too lazy to remove an artifact from ye olden days of computing. I thought their laziness was well-known?
<Shizuka> 13it's sad when putty is a better command prompt than command prompt
<AdamTheDuck> She's known for her "Vorpal blade"
<cachi01|phone> AdamTheDuck lol i love that game
<Phase4> Reikim, they're not lazy, you cant remove text mode, they just havent touched it sence nt 3.5
<Shizuka> 13i love that book
<pony34507> why is everone so mean to me all i did was wanting to talk about fluttershy:'(
<Reikim> So why haven't they touched this thing that I am assuming is important?
<AJIsAwesome> SEEMS LEGIT
<Shizuka> 13lazy
<Reikim> Exactly.
<AdamTheDuck> I like to think that the Vorpal blade is just a regular rusty kitchen knife in her reality...
<Phase4> Shizuka, theres also mintty which works well, but the stdio symantics are broken on windows
<cachi01|phone> Shizuka didnt knew it was a book.
<Dovah> Sacred 2 quote with my own little add on time?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka doing quizes sounds like fun everytime you connect or just one time ?
<twilight_sprinkle> pony34507: fluttershy is not welcome here
<Shizuka> 13those of us that want a powerful command line are already over on a linux or using mintty/cygwin
<Reikim> Aaaand now I'm going to stop being lost and go finish Gunbuster.
<Silver_Spoon> This has fluttershy -in- it...: http://fav.me/d5fuoey
<Phase4> its probably less lazy and more buisness descision
<Shizuka> 13cachi01|phone: Alice in Wonderland?
<pony34507> isnt this a fluttershy theater
<Shizuka> 13no it isn't
<Phase4> the command line tools do exist, batch scripts can be ALMOST as powerfull as bash scripts, but the tools are useless and undocumented
<Shizuka> 13protip, all the chats are the same during the week
<Shizuka> 13and unchanged since dos
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<cachi01|phone> Shizuka ooh lol i thought the american mcgee alice has a book
<AdamTheDuck> Wrong, all the theatres are Spike theatres secretly
<Phase4> yeah
<DashWithRainbows> pony34507 it's just a chat room you connect to during BMN and live pony episodes.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DerpyMuffins
<Polydunami> Hey there, DerpyMuffins
<thelonepony> hi DerpyMuffins
<AdamTheDuck> Because Spike is best pony
<twilight_sprinkle> lol AdamTheDuck

<AdamTheDuck> Hello DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> So what we watching?
<Silver_Spoon> DJ Twilight Sparkle: http://fav.me/d5fts80
<Phase4> and things like wildcard matching arent implimented in cmd
<Dovah> DerpyMuffins: nothing
<twilight_sprinkle> iris needs pony faces..
<Kandarihu> pony34507, all the theater pages besides Spike connect you to the Bronystate IRC as well as the particular sideroom which is normally closed.
<Silver_Spoon> I like
<rainbow> i was bored of my name
<DashWithRainbows> All the rooms connect to Bronystate chat (AKA Mane chat)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> do i get a cigar now Shizu ?
<Shizuka> 13mintty doesn't agree with me much.. that or cygwin's bash is just super slow on its own
<Phase4> they have to be implimented in every application
*Shizuka 13gives TheGreatAndPowerfulT a magic cigar
<Polydunami> Please use /nick, rainbow, so you don't have to log in and out every time.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Yay

<DashWithRainbows> I demand moar pastel coloured equines.
<Kurra> Togusa, the mullet cop, has no enhancements other than a cyberbrain for e-communicating.
<rainbow> does anypony else see stream
<otakon> No one not NO ONE asked for ponies.
<Dester> never ask for ponies, it ends badly
<cachi01|phone> XD u gonna have a bad.time!
<weeping_pegasi82> shizuka: why do you keep saying that...?
<Meanwhile> We'll probably blow ourselves up before then.
<Reikim> ^
<Phase4> Reikim, maybe, you'd have to ask a rocket scientist
<Shizuka> 13captain bulldog!
<rainbow> fat
<Reikim> This would be the logical question.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Wait, someone asked for ponies? :S
<twilight_sprinkle> dat face
<Dovah> Ponies are not real. Do not spread this blasphamy!
<BarbetosSMASH> duba 3
<Kurra> Togusa even carries a plain revolver for his weapon.
<weeping_pegasi82> ugh that's why
<otakon> Kurra: eeyup he's the most "human" officer of Section 9
<rainbow> homo news reporter
<otakon> rainbow: you'll be kicked
<Kurra> I like Togusa, he's the most... 'plain' of Section 9.
<otakon> Shizuka: what? Batou?
<BarbetosSMASH> watch duba 3. It has the real showz.
<rainbow> why
<Cades> i mean they recorded the vocals, but all the drums and guitar are done on a computer

<BarbetosSMASH> Whats the matter rainbow
<Meanwhile> >Came for ponies
<Meanwhile> Well there's your problem.
<DashWithRainbows> >Ponies
<DashWithRainbows> The heck?
<Phase4> rainbow, we stream more than ponies, if you really want pony theres always youtube
<Dovah> BarbetosSMASH: rainbow is troll.
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> What, ponies?
<otakon> rainbow: bc your being angsty over the stream it seems. The mods do this for free and on thei own enjoyment as much as our own. You don't give grief to people that do you stuff for free. Also this is BRONYstate NOT Ponystate. We only show ponies during the on season and on friday nights.
<BarbetosSMASH> rainbow you has youtube.
<Shizuka> 13so the troll has confirmed he can't read the FAQ
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> ^^^
<Scottish-geeky> hello evry pony
<cachi01|phone> ^^
<Kandarihu> Is he a troll or just new and unfamiliar?
<BarbetosSMASH> Or that he can and can log in with a different name
<otakon> hiya Scottish-geeky
<twilight_sprinkle> but reading is soooo 5 years ago..
<Phase4> rainbow, alternatively you can demand ponies, and you will get ponies, think real hard before you do that
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Hi, Scottish-geeky :)
<BarbetosSMASH> Sounds like ban evasion to me
<otakon> Kandarihu: I think the second

<Kurra> Better than a Vulcan.
<Meanwhile> DWR is a big girl's blouse anyway.
<HoodyNinja> DashWithRainbows: I was being sarcastically sexist

<otakon> maybe
<I_Never_Asked_for_Th> dat ass
<Kandarihu> My stance towards bugs is that they are welcome in my house, but if they don't mean me harm, I just send them out of the house without harming them.
<Scottish-geeky> I_Never_Asked_for_Th: i agree
<otakon> Polydunami: bee's don't bother me
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh look, I found my stun gun.

<Meanwhile> Thing is all the TF2 laughs are terribly obnoxious, as they're meant to be.
<I_Never_Asked_for_Th> 3d ponies are a little creepy :X
<HoodyNinja> next time i hit a ghost, imma try laughing
<Shizuka> 13if only you could use schadenfreude taunt to kill ghosts

<HoodyNinja> Phase4: You're computer got broked
<Enix> Wup it up!

<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Does anyone know how high USB drives can go in terms of space?
<Kurra> whoo!
<Dester> well duh
<Meanwhile> Is this ReBoot now?
<Kandarihu> Well, if you COULD kill ghosts with the Schadenfreude taunt, it might make that part of the game pay2win
<rainbow> maze of death
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> Meanwhile: Nope. Season finale.

<Sumica> 00,10just a constant din of BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dester: I live in the southern US and I only hear crickets
<doctor_whooves127> i hate cicadas
<AdamTheDuck> rainbow, yes?
<otakon> no magnum for you
<Dr_Fumbles> Every time I walk in here, it's always anime... coincidence?
<HoodyNinja> The ones in arkansas are perfect
<otakon> GODDAMMIT
<XylemTube> what are we watching ?
<Shizuka> 13if you don't want him to take the revolver why did you offer it to him
<Enix> There no cicadas in the SPRING!
<Dester> really? im in nc, from ks, full of cicadas
<rainbow> I CANT READ IT
<Kandarihu> I believe I was spared the noise of the cicadias this year.
<Dester> enix well yeh

<Phase4> ANOTHE PING
<HoodyNinja> Enix: It's fall in the northern hemisphere
<XylemTube> 01what are we watching ?01
<rainbow> TO MUCH
<Shizuka> 13that sub was almost visible
<Phase4> this is going to drive me insane
<Sumica> 00,10.....od
<Enix> I was quoting ruroni kenshin
<HoodyNinja> Phase4: Let me help you hout
<Phase4> i keep heaing pings but i'm not being pinged
<Sumica> 00,10I saw no clolors in that yet it triggered a kick
<HoodyNinja> Phase4: VISIBLE PING!
<rainbow> +Phase4
<otakon> public computer huh?
<Polydunami> Enix: Oro?
<Phase4> those visible pings
<otakon> WHAT?!
<Enix> Yup that i was
<otakon> ARMED COUP!?
<rainbow> Tom
<otakon> Those fuckers

<Sumica> 00,10Borma?
<Polydunami> Saito, huh?
<Shizuka> 13boma
<Sumica> 00,10I thought it was bolma

<otakon> Booma
<HoodyNinja> Coo wHip
<Crystaline_Shard> Nationality Barcode :D
<CriticKitten> Paz.
<otakon> ahem Boma
<Kandarihu> Sumica, 1,1
<Shizuka> 13boruma probably
<Tiberium126> 200cm thats tall
<otakon> damn they've all been captured huh?
<Shizuka> 13notice the english dub makes it pazu instead of paz
<Dester> this is a bad infodump!
<Phase4> wonder whot those barcodes contain
<Phase4> what'
<otakon> Tiberium126: Batou is the big guy
<Shizuka> 13duhhhhh
<rainbow> :S i feel bad for them
<Shizuka> 13it's togusa's uhhhhhhhh face
<Enix> Whos that in the window?
<HoodyNinja> he dead
<rainbow> barcode to confusing
<Enix> can't be the major
<otakon> rainbow: it's supposed to be
<Sumica> 00,10and now we see togusa's reinactment of "falling down"
<Dester> How can you die if you are a program?
<otakon> SHUT UP YOU DAMN BUGS
<HoodyNinja> In teh futcha! Ware errythang is dijitul!
<rainbow> is atoms on?
<Dester> otakon agreed
<otakon> Dester: your braincase gets destroyed
<doctor_whooves127> ahhh cicadas
<Kandarihu> Barcodes are there to represent that there's text that any cyborg can read but the animators don't have to type lots of text out.
<doctor_whooves127> >_<
<HoodyNinja> otakon: I find it relaxing
<otakon> Dester: a ghost without a shell quickly loses itself to the degradation of the wild web.
<Dester> otakon but how is a brain anydifferent that the computer?
<rainbow> cicadas i enjoy
<doctor_whooves127> true
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> HoodyNinja: Agreed.
<Shizuka> 13is that
<otakon> Dester: it's still storing it there, if you destroy the container the contents are destroyed as well.
<Dester> why can't her ghost float about? like a natural intelligence turned ai? like a kind of browser with info?
<rainbow> no
<Kurra> The Chinese Room, errwhere
<HoodyNinja> I guess you just gotta grow up with them, haven't heard one in years.
<rainbow> yes
<Meanwhile> Long and hard he says.
<Shizuka> 13long and hard he says
<HoodyNinja> kinda nastolgic
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> :D
<Shizuka> 13if you know what togusa means
<Dester> long and hard? thats what she said
<Enix> lol
<otakon> Dester: it's possible but highly unlikely. It's like trying to keep afloat in a stormy sea.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dohoho
<rainbow> :D
<flutter_spin> It can be debated that a brain is simply an AI to the nth degree, able to learn for nearly forever
<Shizuka> 13the VA and the face makes me swear that DA is gouda
<Kurra> Brains are Turing-capable machines right?
<Shizuka> 13but it's not cause gouda comes up from intelligence iirc
<Dester> otakon but the idea is essentially cloud computing, no?
<rainbow> STOP WATCHING MORGAN FREEMAN
<Polydunami> Is this the real life?
<Sumica> 00,10hard to say Shizuka
<Kurra> I think brains pass Turing tests
<Polydunami> Is this just fantasy?
<Dester> besides we see complex patterns form inn open ocean waves, really randomness can build to create insade patterns
<HoodyNinja> An extended period of time or measurement AND tougher difficulty/density? ASTOUNDING!
<otakon> Dester: yeah but like I said it's hard to keep yourself as a free floating program to keep your personality and memories
<Enix> Goda's that guy with the f'ed up face righT?
<Shizuka> 13was trying to squish his face up in my head which made it match even more, but i'm pretty certain at this point in time gouda would be at intelligence
<rainbow> now what
<flutter_spin> Realistically, I doubt computers will ever match 1/10th of the potential of a human brain
<Shizuka> 13cause the accident that causes his squishy face is like years ago iirc
<Dester> otakon I'm not so sure, i mean store you selkf in redundencies in buffers
<HoodyNinja> flutter_spin: We only use 10% of our brainpower, and computers outthink us every second
<Shizuka> 13hey togusa you're angry and frustrated i know
<Kimori> back
<Polydunami> At a time, HoodyNinja
<Dester> pictured, hugley overrated book
<Shizuka> 13but that's no reason to litter
<weeping_pegasi82> who's laughing man?
<otakon> Shizuka: you know this better than me can you explain why it's hard for a ghost to exist outside of a shell for extended periods of time?
<doctor_whooves127> I thought what I'd do was, I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes.
<rainbow> what is that animal on the book :S
<otakon> And then he became the laughing man
<Shizuka> 13we'll get there otakon
<AJIsAwesome|Homework> inb4 Togusa gets a ticket fo littering
<otakon> Batou
<HoodyNinja> Polydunami: How does that affect my argument?
<otakon> You sly dog
<Kurra> :D
<Meanwhile> Troll Batou.
<thelonepony> :D
<otakon> Got his gun back
<Kurra> I want some cyber food!
<Buytoast> wait what
<Shizuka> 13just stand out there with a revolver in your hand
<twilight_sprinkle> nice to see you, dumbo
<Polydunami> Isn't it 10% of one's brainpower at a time, HoodyNinja?
<TopHat> herk heeerg
<otakon> Polydunami: no
<Shizuka> 13Polydunami: we use 100% of our brains
<Buytoast> how did jc denton escape the mega police?
<flutter_spin> lol
<otakon> Polydunami: that was disproven
<Dester> Polydunami that is an OLD myth
<Kurra> We use 100% of our brains.
<Enix> 13%?
<HoodyNinja> That makes us dumber then
<otakon> yeah we do use 100% of our brains
<Polydunami> I know about it being untrue, everypony -_(\
<Kurra> All of our brain is used for all the managing functions of all our existence.
<otakon> Polydunami: then why oyou bring it up?
<Spectrum_Rush> Which means its all down hill from here
<Polydunami> You're asking the wrong pony, otakon.
<TopHat> if that were the case, we could take out 90% of our brain and still live
<Sumica> 00,10it's like the idle system process on your computer
<otakon> So what happened to the tech guys?
*Spectrum_Rush like yamcha
<Dester> anyone else get dizzy after using chats after along time?
<Enix> Best kinda of cooking
<Shizuka> 13pretended to sacrifice section 9, even though they have to convince kayabuki to give them funding again
<Dester> \this sounds like BS he made up on the spot
<otakon> Dester: sometimes it's from staring at a screen too long
<Kimori> Its time to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT9r_-oHJV0
<flutter_spin> You can get dizzy just by staring at the computer screen.
<Kimori> :D
<HoodyNinja> Kurra: So, if we got a machine to control our bodily functions for us, we could increase our thinking capacity?
<Kimori> but its so quiet so dunno lol
*Kurra brings up every argued and old notion that's been discussed among groups since ever
<Tiberium126> Bye Bronies and pegasisters.
<Kurra> nope.
<Dester> its only chatrooms though, weird
<flutter_spin> It is recommented to take a 15min break after every 4 hours

<Meanwhile> otakon: Yeah I got that bit.
<Sumica> 00,10all of them diffrent too Shizuka
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: That's natural. This show is naturally confusing.
<Kurra> The only thing Major Motoko Kusanagi owns, according to her, is her ghost. Her posessions, clothes, even her body aren't rally hers....

<Dark_Horst> ah
<Kandarihu> Yeah. That episode calls for this
<Shizuka> 13READ A BOOK
<Dester> The whole idea of a world where one can so easily manipulte oneself is a society where people are far more alike, how, because they see undesirable traits (from the point of the culture/society) and then change themselves to fit that role
<Shizuka> 13READ A BOOK

<HoodyNinja> TopHat: Asia is about as f*cked up as the U.S
<ASoftFluffyThing> otakon: I'd get confused with the dice. Like, why in the HELL do you need a 16-sided die?
<Enix> Motoko is favorite heroine
<rainbow> DOCTOR WHO IS AWESOME ;)
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: What?? -lol

<flutter_spin> Play with friends > Playing Solo
<Meanwhile> What's wrong with Monopoly?
<HoodyNinja> Nothing
<flutter_spin> oh please. Monopoly is a death trap
<Dester> agreeed
<flutter_spin> Mouse Trap is better than Monopoly

<Dester> what kind of armour shows cleavage?
<HoodyNinja> ASoftFluffyThing: Put in my family and you get a fight in 10 minutes, my point is D&D has alot more complicated functions and mechanics too it than other board games. Besides, it's not just a board game, it's a Role Playing Game
<Dester> I mean, really
<flutter_spin> I used to like chess, until people were all "I nailed you with the X strategy" and I quit.
<Shizuka> 13gordon freeman in a cameo

<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: why do they need it?
<Polydunami> Will there ever be a My Little Pony edition of Monopoly? Or do Hasbro and Parker Bros. have something against each other?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: it's like having a e-mail
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: I honestly doubt it.
<otakon> That voice

<Sumica> 00,10and yes suddnly recaps
<rainbow> is this really important
<DeadpoolDash> damn everyone has gundam
<twilight_sprinkle> that almost sounded like alan rickman
<DeadpoolDash> I remember when gundams were rare
<Sumica> 00,10it is if you have not watched any eps rainbow
<rainbow> no i dont really find this stuff
<Rawket> Edradicaiton of wars through force. . .sheesh, seems kind of silly.
<rainbow> too much
<DeadpoolDash> wars will only truly end when humanity is gone
<rainbow> america
<rainbow> really
<DeadpoolDash> you can only prevent war currently with the threat of war
<rainbow> i want one i can kill go back in time if possible and kill hittler
<TopHat> why can't we all be like canada
<AJIsAwesome> rainbow: Paradoxes.
<Ryunosuke> that sounds kinda like snape
<twilight_sprinkle> whos that va? he sounds a lot like rickman
<Ryunosuke> i thought it was just me
<Silver_Spoon> TopHat: We ain't cold enough
<rainbow> they like ponies to but they make shitty plays
<rainbow> for it
<rainbow> like mlp live
<rainbow> kaboooom
<TopHat> so you're saying the only reason canadians are nice is because it's cold?
<DeadpoolDash> no one could ever afford to spend the money to build all this shit
<TopHat> it all makes sense now. The hotter the earth gets, the more violent we get
<TopHat> we can blame all the wars on global warming

<AJIsAwesome> I'm fine with 2 portal games.

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hahaha
<flutterbrony> i didnt see it can you rewind?
<Polydunami> Boobs are all it takes for some people to classify it as porn :|
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O.o
<Polydunami> Rumiko Takahashi's more famous works could hardly be described as pornographic in nature.
<Ninjazz> I like to include the lower parts before I consider porn.
<AdamTheDuck> Bewbs
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: :S
<flutterbrony> so
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, Ohai. ^_^;
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02ZOMG BEWBS

<AdamTheDuck> Yay more Wii U
<flutterbrony> yay
<flutterbrony> YES
<Polydunami> Well, no one gets aroused by it, do they?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I might actually get this game o.o
<AdamTheDuck> Even though I'm not a big nintendo fan xD
<OneTrickPony> good morning everyone
<Polydunami> I mean in-universe :P
<Polydunami> Oh hey, OneTrickPony
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Haven't really beaten the first one nor played the second ><
<Polydunami> Never played the series.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Anypony know if this is like Final Fantasy where the number in the game doesn't matter it all has a unique story?
<flutterbrony> lol
<AdamTheDuck> Come to think of it the only games I really enjoyed on a nintendo platform (DS) were the Professor Layton series
<Ryunosuke> and the guard didnt see the shadow of the tree... why?
<Polydunami> I'm sorry to hear that, AdamTheDuck
<Ryunosuke> just saying
<flutterbrony> like a boss
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I like the Professor Layton series as well :D
<flutterbrony> lol
<Ryunosuke> 'where'd he go?'
<Polydunami> I mean, Professor Layton is enjoyable, but it's hardly the only enjoyable series of games on a Nintendo platform.
<Ryunosuke> you know
<Ryunosuke> they have muskets... couldnt they just... you know... SHOOT HIM
<Ryunosuke> ugh
<Ryunosuke> video game logic defies me
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah, I really only liked the older Pokemon games
<flutterbrony> :S wat are you two talking about?
<Spectrum_Rush> NewSuperBronyU: Professor Layton vs. Ace Attorney
<OneTrickPony> this is gonna be a good game
<Polydunami> Ace Attorney is another enjoyable franchise.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hmm...this guy is pretty good at playing the game :P
<Polydunami> I wish Capcom of America could realise that :|
<MadSurge> Ryunosuke: only if he's far away... muskets aren't great in hand to hand combat :D
<Ryunosuke> ......
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Spectrum_Rush: That'll be a cool game :3
<flutterbrony> lets screw with gorge washington
<Ryunosuke> MadSurge, thats why they have bayonettes right? :)
<MadSurge> Polydunami: at least the newer one will be released on the 3DS
<pony_7457> Assassins disquise as soldier
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02"Sir...I think this is the weird guy we were supposed to find and kill"
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02"Ah...I do believe you are right good chap, shall we walk a few more feet and then attack him?"
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02"Jolly good."
<Polydunami> But will it be released on North American soil, MadSurge?
<Polydunami> Rather, soil outside of Japan?
<MadSurge> Polydunami: apparently YES!
<flutterbrony> butt him off the boat
<Ryunosuke> if you are surrounded by 5 or 6 soldiers with bayonettes... you most likely are NOT gonna get away without a few new holes, no matter how much Chuck Norris you think you are :)
<Polydunami> Well, I now have reason to purchase a 3DS :3
<Polydunami> Also, Ocarina of Time
<Spectrum_Rush> Polydunami: Ace Attorney 5 will be released out of japan
<flutterbrony> my friends dad was in a movie with chuck norris
<Phase4> wow, assasins creed got on the wow bandwagon to?
<Ryunosuke> and then wos
<Ryunosuke> wow
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Oh lulz, that game came out today
<Phase4> :P
<Ryunosuke> wow is meh
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I wonder if there was a midnight launch of it
<flutterbrony> plz pony vids like ppp
<Polydunami> And then we could possibly see a release of the second Investigations game when Ace Attorney 5 becomes popular?
<Polydunami> *if
<Ryunosuke> i will say this, wow lets you play with the minimal ammount of brain power :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Fine, we'll watch ponies
<Ryunosuke> uh oh
<AdamTheDuck> Yay G3
<MadSurge> :D G3.5!
<MadSurge> THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
<Phase4> YOUR NOT SCOOTALOO

<Polydunami> And now you know what happens when you ask for ponies, flutterbrony
<Phase4> YOU'RE NOT SCOOTALOO'

<Phase4> NewSuperBronyU, did someone demand ponies?
<flutterbrony> naw

<Phase4> voice acting is terrible
<Polydunami> Only in the world of... ponies
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Err...I mean...
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Flutterbrony did.
<MadSurge> NewSuperBronyU: Ikr :D

<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Ah, I see
<Jake> Healthy levels of insanity: if someone asks you to do something ask "want fries with that?"
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: sorry for the sudden question, but do you plan on having children?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Nope
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :P
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I don't think I'd make a good mom, and my husband doesn't think he'd make a good dad. So we've unanimously decided not to have kids.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: fair enough!
<Jake> Who is %BerryPunch by the way
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: enough big kids in the house amirite?
<MadSurge> Jake: it's just a chatbot

<Sergio_Scriptor> hi guys :)
<Mega_Milk> Ponies47: I meant today period. But yeah. That explains why your up so early.
<Princess_Cadence> o3o
<Mega_Milk> Sergio_Scriptor: Sup.
<Gold_Demona> Hi Sergio_Scriptor
<Ninjazz> ohai, Sergio_Scriptor.
<Ponies47> Mega_Milk: I hate getting up early. ;_;
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: No its one song. Dub step is just like that.
<Ponies47> Hey Sergio_Scriptor
*Sergio_Scriptor waves too Mega_Milk , Gold_Demona , Ninjazz and Ponies47 :)
<Mega_Milk> Ponies47: -lol I feel bad for you. You have no idea how good it feels to be able to take a cat nap in the middle of the day -lol
<Ponies47> Mega_Milk: Pfffft. Naps\
<Gold_Demona> Mega_Milk: But there was an 8-bit pony song playing at the same time.
<Gold_Demona> Mega_Milk: There it is again. Winter Wrap Up. It's not supposed to be there.
<Phase4> i'ma change servers soon
<Mega_Milk> Ponies47: Say what you want. But when I dont have to worry about a ruler rapping against my deak and hearing some old hag screech in my ear to wake up I call that heaven.
<Phase4> theres ninjas on this one
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Thats a TF2 mod song
<Gold_Demona> ah
<Phase4> stream working good?
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Whenever a match resets or somepony dominates it plays a little tune.
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Better than ever.
<Phase4> no sound problems?
<Ponies47> Mega_Milk: You have a point. High school teahcers can really be asses sometimes
<Gold_Demona> I see
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: a little bit of distortion, but otherwise good
<Phase4> :3
<Sergio_Scriptor> Phase4: why dont you try a randomizer server ? or a pony themed vs saxton hale :)
<Mega_Milk> Ponies47: Eeyup.
<Sergio_Scriptor> oh forget this is a vs saxton hale :d
<Sergio_Scriptor> only notest now
<CrimsonPhoenix> this makes me think of that doom mod deathmatch
<CrimsonPhoenix> with megaman settings and characters
<MadSurge> Celestia! :D
<SirGanjalf> Holy trippy retro graphics, Demoman!
<SirGanjalf> wuts the name of that map?
<Sergio_Scriptor> camping Phase XD
<Mega_Milk> SirGanjalf: What your looking for is the server name not the map.
<Mega_Milk> SirGanjalf: The map is just a regular map modded.
<Sergio_Scriptor> SirGanjalf: possibly " vsh_megaman" ? :\
<Sergio_Scriptor> or something like that
<MadSurge> DED
<Phase4> this is going nowhere fast
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: The spy is trolling you -lol And the scout is just running away.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Mega_Milk: dem dead ringer spies :|
<Mega_Milk> Sergio_Scriptor: One is a dead ringer. The other is a cloak.
<Phase4> hmmm

<ofna01> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<killerpony7733> Or magic, or magnets!
<LightTrooper105> puns..
*Ponies47 throws tomates at ofna01 "BOOOOOOOOOO"
<AdamTheDuck> Puns, puns everywhere
<Ponies47> Get off the stage ofna01!

<LightTrooper105> eeyup

<LightTrooper105> dat ofna02 o.o
<Emil> Lil_B: Group hug?
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh DICE
<AdamTheDuck> How you were great once.
<Lil_B> Emil probably :)
<ofna02> My browser crashed, says ofna01 is in use
<AdamTheDuck> Before EA killed you.
<ofna02> :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> this was back when EA was not a douch
<ofna02> Bf3 is still good...
<LightTrooper105> or you could be a clone O.O
<ofna02> i enjoy BF3
<ofna01> derp
<Gold_Demona> ofna clone? :O
<ofna01> there
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna02: prepare for the flame war
<Emil> ofna02: Me too.
<LightTrooper105> lol
<ofna01> Got it
<ofna01> fixed
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck Well BF3 is okay and all, though yeah BF2 and the any of the ones before was ALOT better
<Lil_B> SDtop waling on the Solar Pannels!
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733, yes. Indeed.
<ofna01> sstream laggy for anyone else?
<Lil_B> walking*
<Emil> Battlefield Heroes?
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: nor for me :\
<Sergio_Scriptor> *not
<AdamTheDuck> BF3 did not live up to it's name.
<AdamTheDuck> its*
<LightTrooper105> we all have different opnion
<Emil> AdamTheDuck: Opinions, opinions...
<AdamTheDuck> ^ yep
<ofna01> LEAP OF FAAAAAAAAITH
<LightTrooper105> i like all the battlefield
<Sergio_Scriptor> to be hones the game that beats cod and BF is TF2 :P
<Emil> ofna01: See what you did there...
<LightTrooper105> cant wait for bf4
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck Yeah it's okay if you take the time to enjoy it but stand alone in it's core it just can't feel fun like any of the older ones
<ofna01> :3
<Gold_Demona> Too bad there are no haystacks to leap into.
<Emil> ^
*Gold_Demona makes eagle noises
<ofna01> she has to synchronize her viewpoint first Gold
<ofna01> After you synchronize, leap of faith
<Gold_Demona> ofna01: Oh yeah. I forgot
<Sergio_Scriptor> Phase4: ever played the tf2 Mirrors edge maps ? :P
<ofna01> faith be dead
<Emil> Dafuq is he doing?
<Emil> lol
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733, you should see how much it has changed since release...
<Phase4_> i used to be good i sware
<ofna01> yer ass
<Phase4_> Sergio_Scriptor: nope
<LightTrooper105> lol
<Emil> Phase4: A bit rusty, eh?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Phase4: if you want or have time i can give you a ip later :)
<ofna01> LEAP OF FAAAITH
<Emil> AAAH
<ofna01> im gonna do that whenever there's a big jump from now on
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck Oh yeah. It's become quite stale... armored kill is k but all it's about is just showing off their engine and not making the game even more fun
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733, it was "ok" at launch, but then I just saw the game go downhill every patch since. :/ My opinion anyway.
<Emil> Watching this almost makes me want to move around.
<ofna01> Gurl
<ofna01> what you doin
<Sergio_Scriptor> Emil: nah you are beter in here watcing bronystate :)
<ofna01> girl
<ofna01> STAHP
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck True in some form. It was actually alot of fun about and around when B2K was around but...the patches afterwards got meh
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Phase4> and then i broke mirrors edge
<ofna01> D:
<ofna01> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Emil> Ouch.
<ofna01> LEAP OF FAAAITH?
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733, I'm not worried of stability of graphics and whatnot, gameplay was tweaked too much from launch...
<LightTrooper105> lol..
<Emil> Phase4: You seem to be good at breaking stuff, yes?
<ofna01> :P stupid kick
<Phase4> Emil, yeah
<LightTrooper105> to learn things one must break it first :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> Emil: you kiding ? just look at his kerbal space program rockets :d jk
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733, one more question... How does a bit of weighed plastic (a foregrip) decrease a firearm's accuracy?
<ofna01> Sergio_Scriptor: that just reinforces our point xD
<Emil> Sergio_Scriptor: Yeah, that too.
<Phase4> lets try something i've not played yet
<ofna01> NO PHASE
<ofna01> moar mirrors edge
<AdamTheDuck> Torchlight?
<ofna01> D:
<LightTrooper105> that reminds me..
<Emil> AdamTheDuck: It doesn't, it improves it.
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh Assassin's Ceed
<AdamTheDuck> Creed*
<Sergio_Scriptor> Phase4: remeber whenever you want i can give you the mirrors edge tf2 mode :P
<Emil> Borderlands?
<ofna01> WE need something either assassins creed or Mirrors Edge
<Gold_Demona> I just started playing that the other day, lol. XD
<AdamTheDuck> Emil, explain that to BF3's logic then.
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck Yeah stupid logic. IRL said grip helps a soldier keep his barrel aimmed down and it gets alot better to avoid side to side recoil
<ofna01> Adam
<ofna01> its logic
<Emil> AdamTheDuck: Well, the foregrip improves accuracy.
<ofna01> its DICE logic
<ofna01> k?
<LightTrooper105> i got 1 game of torchlight
<Emil> Now I have to go check... Damn it...
<AdamTheDuck> ofna01, Dice logic, it just needs to stop there...
<LightTrooper105> anyone wants it?
<ofna01> VALVE TIME
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck I mean for one it should both help improve vertical and horizontal recoil IRL and it's range should be fine
<killerpony7733> LightTrooper105 Sure
<ofna01> MY birthday is in 6 days
<ofna01> yaaaay
<LightTrooper105> killerpony7733 do I have you on steam?
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: sorry to ask,but how many ? :P
<ofna01> 16
<LightTrooper105> ofna01 and how old are you now?
<Phase4> didnt even get a chance to break that one
<ofna01> I'm 15
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: cool :) i make 16 in 22 of november :P
<LightTrooper105> going 16 congratz lol
<killerpony7733> LightTrooper105 Yeppers but gimme ya steam name cause i got a friends only profile
<killerpony7733> I turned 18 last sunday
<killerpony7733> So wooo! :D
<Phase4> oh wait i finished that game
<ofna01> Phase4: can we play KSP?
<ofna01> plz?
<ofna01> :3
<Phase4> ofna01, i cant make thie stream be just ksp
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: dont tempt him :d
<Phase4> you'll get the entire desktop
<ofna01> :(
<Phase4> anyone here got synergy?
<ofna01> Nope.avi
<killerpony7733> LightTrooper105 What's ya steam?
<LightTrooper105> killerpony7733 my steam name still the same but the pick the one with fily Celestia
<Sergio_Scriptor> Phase4: i usted to have :'(
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733, that and it gives one better control of where one points the weapon but that can't really be implemented into a game...
<Phase4> might as well try this
<ofna01> Play some New Vegas phase
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Yes :D
<Phase4> it probably still instadies
<Phase4> i meen skyrim wont start either
<AdamTheDuck> :/
<Phase4> bethesda just doesnt like me
<hazard> if i could stream id stream MOHF my fav game
<ofna01> :/
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck Yeah again stupid logic. But again DICE isn't aimming for realism
<killerpony7733> Well again how the hell can you make a fully realistic game?
<killerpony7733> For a game you always have to have some form of unrealistic thing in it
<hazard> if u could id buy it first no matter how costly
<LightTrooper105> killerpony7733 sent
<LightTrooper105> not game can be real as real life
<Sergio_Scriptor> Phase4: 66.150.121.42 ip for tf2 mirros edge mode if you want :)
<LightTrooper105> that why they are called realistic
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733, well ArmA is a military simulator
<LightTrooper105> I have Arma 2
<killerpony7733> Yeah again then the term of realism is a bad term to use. You can say a game with some realistic traits
<hazard> anypony ever play medal of honor frontline?
<Sergio_Scriptor> LightTrooper105: you mean you have Dayz :P
<ofna01> i HAD the free version Light
<LightTrooper105> but because of DayZ they thinks its a zombie game now..
<ofna01> I have a phobia of zombies
<Phase4> must install more directx
*ofna01 shivers
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck Yeah it's what you can call a fairly realistic game in terms of several things but it still like any other game has unrealistic traits
<Sergio_Scriptor> im not going to buy arma 3 cause im waiting for the dayz stand-alone free to play get's relased :)
<Sergio_Scriptor> *arma 2
<LightTrooper105> Sergio_Scriptor I enjoy DayZ but the fact people thinks its a game by its own its just idiotic..
<hazard> zombies can atttack me all they want i have plenty of guns and ammo
<AdamTheDuck> I did like Red Orchestra though, has some realism aspects but still has the video game feel of not being a simulator
*ThunderStrike walks slowly over to ofna01, gargling spit out from his severed jaw and reaches out to grab him
<Sergio_Scriptor> LightTrooper105: well they are planing on making a dayz stand-alone game,but for now,you have to live with the fact that most people that have recently pbought arma 2 bought it for dayz :P
<ofna01> Thunder, thats not god damn funny
<killerpony7733> LightTrooper105 What sucks too is that ever since it's rise in popularity a metric ton of hackers has invaded the game and it's too common to find the douchebags with full gear killing you alot
<Ponies47> GTG now later everypony :(
<ThunderStrike> ofna01: wait, you're serious?
<d3rb> bye Ponies47
<ofna01> I'm serious.
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ponies47
<killerpony7733> LightTrooper105 And the fact everyone and just about everyone is a paranoid douchenozzle
<Sergio_Scriptor> bye Ponies47 :)
<LightTrooper105> killerpony7733 I know Im an admin on a Arma2 server and now I ban mostly hacker..
<Sergio_Scriptor> killerpony7733: well i guess it's supose to simulate real zombie experience :P
<Sumica> 00,10well damit, why is the transscribe audio not working
<LightTrooper105> some people ask me how to play the game and they got it becasue of DayZ
*ThunderStrike grabs a shotgun and stands by ofna01 "okay! no zombies touch this guy!"
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Sumica
<Sumica> 00,10oh hi.
<killerpony7733> LightTrooper105 Yep either it's cause people love making people rage due to how hard the mod is or it's some kid who thinks they are the best
<Gold_Demona> ohai Sumi
<Sergio_Scriptor> Phase4: didnt you finissed this game already ? :|
<Sergio_Scriptor> *finished
<AdamTheDuck> Sergio_Scriptor, DLC
<Sergio_Scriptor> AdamTheDuck: ha ok :\
<Phase4> Sergio_Scriptor, this is dlc
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, still going pacifist?
<AdamTheDuck> Dat ass
<Sumica> 00,10I meen it looks like it should work no? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCSi5h3Fy74
<LightTrooper105> killerpony7733 yeah I know I heard many of them are a pro on DayZ.. and yet they can't even learn how to drive... nor fly
<Phase4_> i need a better irc client for steam
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sumica: hum...you are a mod that posted a video link...so...do you ban yourself ? :d
<AdamTheDuck> Yay 1 views
<LightTrooper105> Sumica nice quality
<Sumica> 00,10I gave my self premition =p
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sumica: :D
<LightTrooper105> Sumica lol at "Yada-yada all rights to those that own them this is just a test run any ways."
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah the quality was one issue that made me starting this take so long
<Sumica> 00,10but damit why is the transscribe audio not making it funny.
<Lil_B> what where you trying to do?
<Lil_B> were*
<Sumica> 00,10ever see when i sream the pony songs from the show with youtube trying to subtitle them?
<Sergio_Scriptor> yeah
<Lil_B> actually... no
<Sumica> 00,10well most the songs dont have that option
<hazard> sooo bored
<Lil_B> oh, so you tried to uoppload one with the option... ok :/
<Sergio_Scriptor> hazard: cheer up LALALALALALAAL and fit like a fidle ready for love i could jump ove tthe beatifull barn,fit like a fidle and ready for love *plays violin in a green stripe suit*
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Lil_B
<Sumica> 00,10trying to figure out how to get it to do that
<Kandarihu> Sumica, I see the word English subtitle in the beginning, and the only option I have is to translate THAT into any other language or turn it off.
<Kandarihu> I... just said the obvious again didn't I?
<Phase4_> now what
<ofna01> you need to get a gun Phase
<Phase4_> but i play pascifist
<Sumica> 00,10hmmmm, perhaps I did it wrong
<LightTrooper105> phase4_ go sneaky and get gun
<Sumica> 00,10they dont have much in the way of how toos
<ofna01> Well, sometimes you can't always be a pacifist Phase
<Sergio_Scriptor> Phase4: dont listen to them,play pacifist :)
<AdamTheDuck> If only Wrek were here...
<Jmo> o.o
<ofna01> Jensens sexy and he knows it
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, it's simple, we kill the Batman.
<AdamTheDuck> Punch them in the face?
<Kandarihu> AdamTheDuck, I thought he's always lurking
<Phase4_> i think if i wait long enough they'll walk off
<ofna01> Phase, just punch'em in the face
<Sergio_Scriptor> AdamTheDuck: i guess that would be Paci FIST :D god i suck
<ofna01> it won't kill them
<AdamTheDuck> http://chzsomuchpun.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/funny-puns-horschach.jpg Mawr puns :3

<Sergio_Scriptor> AdamTheDuck: :d
<Phase4_> how i wish for my augs back
<ofna01> I need to get over my phobias
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: can i ask what they are ? :\
<ofna01> I'm afraid of zombies and large crowds
<ofna01> I don't like it when people yell either
<ofna01> YES!
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: oh,im afraid of things that dont make any sense :P
<ofna01> GOOD JOB PHASE!
<AdamTheDuck> PUNCH
<LightTrooper105> a guard with 2 shot and no ammo
<Gold_Demona> Even though zombies are fictional and can't possibly do anything to you? O_o
<ofna01> I'm afraid it could happen
<LightTrooper105> bugget cut this day
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: like if i saw something that is not supost to be there,or that should not ecist or makes no sense what so ever it scares me :'(
<ofna01> even though its not possible
<Gold_Demona> Oooook
<AdamTheDuck> o.o Am I the only one who wishes for a zombie apocalypes?
<Sylandest> lol, doors
<ofna01> Adam, NO

<Sergio_Scriptor> AdamTheDuck: well i would like to happen,but then we have no ponies :'(
<ofna01> thinking about stuff like that gives me panic attacks
<Phase4_> i'm batman
<Gold_Demona> AdanTheDuck, I like my brains where they are thanks
<AdamTheDuck> But then I have a reason to say I read the zombie survival guide from cover to cover :D
<AdamTheDuck> then I will have*
<AdamTheDuck> squeak squeak squeak

<AdamTheDuck> Ok..

<ofna01> I'm already feeling a panic attack coming on from it
<Jmo> o.O
*AdamTheDuck licks Jmo too
<Phase4_> not sure if guard stupid or smart
<Sergio_Scriptor> AdamTheDuck: you never licked me :'(
<mentallyeffedguy> im watching rocky :D
*hazard curls up in ball and sleeps

<AdamTheDuck> Sergio_Scriptor, Caramel told me not to lick people I don't know :<

<Sumica> 00,10FORSCIENCE!
*Sumica copys a snipet of the things sed in chat
<ofna01> Everyone tells me zombies will never exist, but i'm still afraid
<Kandarihu> Well, war has a way of resetting things. And clearly there are things that really need to be reset in such a way. AdamTheDuck, this doesn't need to involve zombies.
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: dont worry,if they do exist the cold winter would kill them in no time :)
<AdamTheDuck> Kandarihu, wow, how did you know I hate today's society? :3
<ofna01> I worry alot
<AdamTheDuck> Well hate is a strong word
<ofna01> I'm afraid of 2012 too
<AdamTheDuck> Dislike is "better"
*hazard falls asleep
<Lil_B> ok, I think I'm finally Satisfied with my new song XD (it's true what tehy say, don't think about it too muich and it will become good -.-)
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: that is just a fake,the maya calender is just like a normal calendar,it's the end of a cicle but the begining fo a new one,nothing will chnage :)

<Sergio_Scriptor> AdamTheDuck: of course
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28500000/OMGOSH-so-cute-Twilight-Sparkle-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-28577702-894-894.png this will make you feel beter :)
<ofna01> HNNNNG
<AdamTheDuck> ofna01, tomorrow never comes, so stop worrying about the future. Think of the present.
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Sergio_Scriptor, D'aaaaaawwwwwww :D
<Sergio_Scriptor> AdamTheDuck: :)
<ofna01> Thanks adam, that helps alot
<Gold_Demona> Future's not worth thinking about anyway. Almost never happens like you think it will
<Sergio_Scriptor> Gold_Demona: but that is why we must make an efort so that it may happen :P
<ofna01> WE control our future
<Sergio_Scriptor> ^
<Gold_Demona> To an extent
<ofna01> Some things we can control, some are beyond our control
<ofna01> BREAK DAT GLASS STUFF
<Gold_Demona> I prefer to live in the present. I can deal with the present.
<Kandarihu> AdamTheDuck, how could you say such a thing if you didn't?

<Kandarihu> Sergio_Scriptor, I dream of that too
<ofna01> I've even got games i would like to play if i ever streamed
<Sergio_Scriptor> Kandarihu: i guess we all do,when a new job for mod here arrives it will be like a war,friendship gets fogoten to see who gets there first :d
<ofna01> Hey, there's a spider on your face! I'll get it! WITH MY FIST!
<Sergio_Scriptor> but i will be super mad if Meanwhile get's the job :|
<ofna01> I need to take karate or something to increase my self-esteem

<Kandarihu> Sergio_Scriptor, ofna01, I hope you have better computers than mine.
<ofna01> Sergio, thats god damn AWESOME
<AdamTheDuck> Kandarihu, I'm not sure, you assumed I sort wish society is "reset" which was strange as at times I actually do wish that were the case.

<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Ninjazz> ...please tell me I wasn't the only one who saw THAT MASSIVE LAG.
<LightTrooper105> Ninjazz I saw that too
<Ninjazz> LightTrooper105, looks like we were the victims of a net split or something.
<LightTrooper105> indeed
<LightTrooper105> i was just wondering why the other arent talking..
<Ninjazz> Ikr.
<LightTrooper105> well morning ASoftFluffyThing

*ASoftFluffyThing hugs AdamTheDuck and d3rb_
<ofna01> i got kicked for sending 6 messages in 10 seconds....
<Jmo> ROFL
<LightTrooper105> i was just kick because sending 6 messege at 11 sec?
<ofna01> i sent 2 messages...
<Sergio_Scriptor> i did not even send 7 messagesper second :|
<Ninjazz> Major major lag.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ohai Phase4
<Phase4> BerryPunch is getting a few kicks
<ofna01> Same Sergio
<Kandarihu> Ooh, that never happened in the main campaign, didn't it? Getting headshot while hacking?
<Ninjazz> We might get a global sooner or later.
<LightTrooper105> ok who let derpy in..
<d3rb_> speeding in a 5 message per 10 second zone
<Phase4> Kandarihu, nope, i managed to avoid it
<d3rb_> thats a kick
<ofna01> Kanda, that's what i would EXPECT a guard to do if he found you hacking....
<Sergio_Scriptor> my perfect score of 0 kicks...ruined :'(
<ofna01> Oh, this guy is busy, i'll shoot him in the face!
<Gold_Demona> What the crap? O_o
<d3rb_> you are tainted Sergio_Scriptor
<Sergio_Scriptor> you took away my kick virginity :'(
<ofna01> Someone has gone mad with power
<LightTrooper105> Sergio_Scriptor nothing perfect..
<ofna01> Oh god what Sergio
<ofna01> don't refer to it like that o_O
<Gold_Demona> I got kicked for too many messages when I didn't even send any. O_o
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: :d
<AdamTheDuck> Sergio_Scriptor, lolwut :D
<Ninjazz> Sergio_Scriptor, it sill hurts. T~T
<Sergio_Scriptor> ^
<MirrorImage> clueless guards at their best
<LightTrooper105> lol
<MirrorImage> "Open. Shut. Open. Shut. Open. Shut. Op- OW"
<mentallyeffedguy> does anyone know a site were i can download movies?
<Sergio_Scriptor> mentallyeffedguy: pirate b *censored*
<Gold_Demona> legally? no
<d3rb_> ^
<LightTrooper105> google it
<mentallyeffedguy> well i dont really mind being illegal XD
<Phase4_> these guys are amazingly ignorant of this door
<Kandarihu> Rather than society be reset, I honestly wish it could be reformed from where it is now. Because I don't think I'd like to live in a society after such a reset.
<Gold_Demona> mentallyeffedguy: Keep in mind, you risk getting viruses going that route.
<MirrorImage> Phase4_ - well except for the one that opened it into your face
<AdamTheDuck> Kandarihu, depends on the method of "reset" really.
<Gold_Demona> That's why I stopped pirating movies. Got sick of dealing with viruses
<mentallyeffedguy> Gold_Demona: do you have a better idea then-?
<d3rb_> buy them?
<mentallyeffedguy> i wa
<AdamTheDuck> But shall we keep off this pesimisted topick Kandarihu? :S
<Gold_Demona> mentallyeffedguy: Get a netflix account.
<AdamTheDuck> topic*
<mentallyeffedguy> netflix....... never heard of it xD
<d3rb_> dvds are crazy cheap these days
<Gold_Demona> mentallyeffedguy: What country are you in?
<mentallyeffedguy> Gold_Demona: norway
<Kandarihu> If we're going to be able to reform society, we need to be able to discuss things civilly.
<Gold_Demona> mentallyeffedguy: Ah, well never mind then. :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> d3rb_: i blame blu-ray :P
<Gold_Demona> mentallyeffedguy: Netflix is an american thing
<d3rb_> blu ray is getting cheap too
<d3rb_> its awesome
<Sergio_Scriptor> d3rb_: oh cool :)
<mentallyeffedguy> Gold_Demona: ok

<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: that happens to me a lot on my pc...i hate PING sound so much,it's like im getting ear raped on a constant basis :'(
<Gold_Demona> No ofna. I do too. I'm not very good, but I sing lots here at home while I'm by myself.

<Ninjazz> Saturn, rather dark...
<ofna01> did you guys hear about the robo sandvich?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Also hi Saturn
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: oh yeah :d from tf2 ?
<Lil_B> ohei Saturn :)
<Gold_Demona> robo sandvich? :O
<Gold_Demona> There's a ROBO sandvich?
<Gold_Demona> Must see!
<ofna01> they gave out toy Sandviches at Comic-Con, and it had a code to redeem, and it gave you a robo sandvich
<Sergio_Scriptor> Gold_Demona: on the new tf2 patch :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> can't wait for this year's tf2 haloween event :) i wonder what they will do this year
<MirrorImage> robo sandvich... yeah... http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Robo_Sandvich
<MirrorImage> it's a thing evidently
<ofna01> http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Robo-Sandvich
<Lil_B> ... Guy is these Pony Cosatumes... Guys in these Pony Costum,es everywhere! ;_;
<Gold_Demona> I knew they had robo everybody else, but not the sandvich. XD
<MirrorImage> ./ninja
<ofna01> we linked the same think Mirror xD
<ofna01> I'm still a F2P on TF2
<ofna01> OOOO, i should buy some keys on my birthday!
<Princess_Cadence> im on tf2
<MirrorImage> i'm on minecraft right now.
<MirrorImage> it's amazing how much of a waiting game Tekkit can be
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: oh sorry dude :\ i bought the game in 2010 :) got the proof of purchaase hat
<ofna01> Mirror, Pc or xbox?
<ofna01> Mirror, i use Tekkit too! :D
<MirrorImage> PC, obviously
<MirrorImage> i can never find diamonds for crap
<MirrorImage> but i have 6 stacks of coal and a compressor
<MirrorImage> so i'm doing things the Superman way
<Sergio_Scriptor> MirrorImage: you need to dig between the 20-and 30 layers i belive :P
<ofna01> my first day on tekkit i found 20 diamonds...
<AdamTheDuck> Yay a stun gun
<MirrorImage> Sergio_Scriptor - i have
<MirrorImage> and i'm too lazy to try strip mining an area yet
<Sergio_Scriptor> MirrorImage: and still nothing ? :\
<MirrorImage> so i'm just going to craft my own diamonds
<ofna01> I literally found diamonds within an hour
<Sergio_Scriptor> MirrorImage: ha ok XD
<MirrorImage> ofna01 - yeah, that tends to be my luck
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: i think the world record to find diamons is in 3-6 minutes :)
<Sergio_Scriptor> a guy on you tube did it
<MirrorImage> luckally i have enough solar panels and an electric furnace, so i don't have to worry about using this coal for anything else but moar solar panels
<ofna01> I'm on an online server, so you have to donate to use the rings on it and redmatter shat
<MirrorImage> Sergio_Scriptor - it's amazing how much surface level URANIUM i find though
<ofna01> But i have full nano armor and dark matter sword
<MirrorImage> 0 diamonds, 11 uraniums
<Sergio_Scriptor> MirrorImage: :D uranium is cool though,the paxel i belive it's called :)
<Sergio_Scriptor> and the mutants
<ofna01> Mirror, i had over 200 uranium, THEN my reactor exploded
<MirrorImage> eh, at this point what i'm working for is an energy converter, so i can convert all this uranium into more diamonds
<MirrorImage> probably not going to build a reactor. at least not anytime soon
<Lil_B> making a record of finding diamonds in Minecraft is like a record in getting a royal flash in pokert, it's just about the luck -.-
<ofna01> I made a nuclear reactor, it exploded and wiped my island off the map except 1 or 2 buildings
<Sergio_Scriptor> MirrorImage: cool,but im realy waiting is for the doctor who mod :P
<ofna01> Luckily my valuables were in the chest that exploded
<ofna01> that wasnt*
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: should have used ender chest :d if you had one :P
<ofna01> they had to reset the map after that though xD
<MirrorImage> "They?"
<MirrorImage> it was SMP?
<ofna01> Yup
<ofna01> You want the server IP?
<MirrorImage> nah
<ofna01> k
<MirrorImage> "That computer screen insulted my mother! WARRRGH" *bang bang bang*
<ofna01> xD
<ofna01> DED
<Sergio_Scriptor> MirrorImage: :D
<ofna01> Mirror, Tekkit can be hard
<ofna01> im making a public rollercoaster in it right now, with elevators and jump tracks and stuff
<MirrorImage> ofna01 - considering i lost 3 redstone engines in the process of getting my workshop layout right, yeah
<ofna01> Damn
<MirrorImage> broke it with my fists "oh, i must need a wrench"
<MirrorImage> eenope
<MirrorImage> PICKAXE
<ofna01> I always keep spares of every machine
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: smart choice :)
<MirrorImage> you'd think you need something a little less... brutal to pick up an engine
<MirrorImage> and i don't have the spare resources for extra machines yet
<ofna01> Engine? lets hit it with a pointy pickaxe!
<ofna01> I like how he picks up guns even though he won't use them
<ofna01> xD
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: well that is minecraft logic,the same logic that tells you you can cut a tree with a fish and get gravel and sand with a pickaxe :D
<ofna01> True that
<ofna01> Sergio, you should really try Tekkit
<ofna01> its complicated but ALOT of fun
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mmm gonna get some breakfast
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: i will probably sound like an idiot,but ... what is that ? :P ... sorrry :(
<MirrorImage> Sergio_Scriptor - think Minecraft meets the Industrial Revolution
<Sergio_Scriptor> MirrorImage: oh cool :)
<ofna01> here sergio
<Sergio_Scriptor> MirrorImage: i need to check it out then
<MirrorImage> http://www.technicpack.net/tekkit/
<ofna01> I sent him a link to a vid of it Mirror
<MirrorImage> if that launcher doesn't work for some reason, make sure you have Java 6 installed
<MirrorImage> i only had Java 7 on my computer and it was being rather finicky until i got 6
<ofna01> it adds al kinds of new ores and items, new armor....
<MirrorImage> "Looks okay over here. OH MY ... ughh... *thud*"
<ofna01> Nano armor, Bronze armor, Quantum armor, Redmatter and Darkmatter armor....
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, I'm not sure if there is an achievement for Missing Link solely on being a pacifist
<Sergio_Scriptor> tekkit looks fun :) i love the industrial revolution
<ofna01> Sergio, you should try it
<AdamTheDuck> There Facory Zero but that's requires you to also not use Praxis kits
<ofna01> I have a server and i could teach you
<MirrorImage> we need a BronyState Tekkit server, for sure
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: i probably will :P
<ofna01> yes mirror
<ofna01> yes
<ofna01> that reminds me, i need to buy legit Minecraft instead of cracked for my B-Day
<MirrorImage> if for nothing more than so i don't have to keep wasting redstone building new machines so i can build more new machines after finding more redstone
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: yeah me too :d
<Phase4_> AdamTheDuck: meh, its how i want to play
<ofna01> Notch is a cool dude, he's fine with you cracking it as long as you buy it later
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, Cool.
<MirrorImage> well, that's 3 stacks of coal mascerated
<MirrorImage> just another hour to go to get the other 3 stacks done >_<
<ofna01> Damn mirror
<ofna01> you need a condenser
<MirrorImage> that's what i'm working towards
<ofna01> I have like 5 for different stuff xD
<MirrorImage> can't find the diamonds, so i'm making them!
<ofna01> you got the Obsidian?
<MirrorImage> i'll make it with water and lava cells
<ofna01> Not bad mirror, not bad.
<MirrorImage> i've got this more or less planned out
<ofna01> Ya need to work towards some better armor or weapons too
<MirrorImage> it's just entirely convoluted over the alt plan of "Find 6 diamonds"
<ofna01> Nano at the minimum
<MirrorImage> i do love how i have my choice of material for making diamond
<JunkerKun> Hey all!
<AdamTheDuck> Hello JunkerKun
<ofna01> Hey there JunkerKun
<MirrorImage> i can use Obsidian as the core for the diamond
<JunkerKun> How are you all?
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi JunkerKun :)
<Sergio_Scriptor> JunkerKun: good :P
<MirrorImage> i could use an Iron Block as the core, requiring 9 bars of iron
<MirrorImage> or i can use BRICKS. "Oh look, clay in the river!"
<JunkerKun> MirrorImage: Tekkit?
<MirrorImage> they make the decision so easy...
<MirrorImage> Tekkit
<Phase4_> "no way he was alone" XD
<JunkerKun> MirrorImage: Does it work on 1.3.1 already?
<MirrorImage> no
<Lil_B> hiu JunkerKun :)
<MirrorImage> but there's a launcher that launches 1.2.5 to make it work anyways
<Lil_B> JunkerKun I have a question about your nick
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: Yes?
<Lil_B> JunkerKun is it read like Junker - kun? the the japanese "title" kun?
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: Yup
<ofna01> Mirror, clay is pretty useful
<Loneblackhoves> What game is this
<JunkerKun> Loneblackhoves: Deus Ex 3
<Loneblackhoves> aw
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: i will have fun for sure :)
<JunkerKun> Lil_B: Why?
<AdamTheDuck> Loneblackhoves, Deus Ex HR: The Missing Link DLC
<ofna01> Sergio, you should join my server, i will teach you
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: sorry,but my minecraft does not work with multyplayer :'(
<Meanwhile> Hello everyone.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hello Meanwhile
<Sergio_Scriptor> Hello Meanwhile :)
<JunkerKun> Meanwhile: Hi!
<ofna01> Sergio, it does
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Meanwhile
<Ninjazz> Hey Meanwhile.
<MirrorImage> yeesh, i heard a spider crawling around outside my house, probably on the roof
<ofna01> my server is cracked so you can join
<MirrorImage> climb up there, no spider
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: not mine,it crashes all the time :'( sorry
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs Meanwhile and gives him a Pinkie PIe
<MirrorImage> walk around the house, SPIDER AMBUSH FROM THE ROOF
<ofna01> you should install Tekkit then try
<MirrorImage> >_<
<Sergio_Scriptor> ofna01: i will :)
<Lil_B> JunkerKun nothing really :)
<JunkerKun> MirrorImage: Damn it. I though you was talking about real life spider =/
<Meanwhile> I see Deus Ex is up. Who's playing?
<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, Phase is
<Sergio_Scriptor> Meanwhile: Phase is :P
<JunkerKun> MirrorImage: That would quite big spider if you heard it in real life
<MirrorImage> JunkerKun - Australia, mate
<Meanwhile> Ah, explains the lack of desktop pony.
<MirrorImage> our spiders have Health Bars
<Phase4_> so these guys are into human traficing
<Troy> yo yo fillies
<ASoftFluffyThing> Meanwhile: Phase has a desktop pony.
<Meanwhile> Yes but his is largely for KSP.
<ASoftFluffyThing> True..
<JunkerKun> MirrorImage: Wow. Australians have balls of steel then O_o To live with creatures like this nearby
<MirrorImage> which is why i live in Pennsylvania
<MirrorImage> the most we deal with are Deer, and everyone has guns for that
<AdamTheDuck> I don't get it, our spiders are not "that" big. :D
<Ninjazz> But the point is they /can/ get that big.
<JunkerKun> MirrorImage: Unless deer doesn't come with idea to hunt people. Like in Deer Avenger
<Sergio_Scriptor> JunkerKun: i live in the swiss alpes and in the forest nearby we got bears,dears and other wide animals :P
<Sergio_Scriptor> *wld
<Sergio_Scriptor> *wild
<ofna01> Mirror has BAWLS OF STEEEEEEL
<MirrorImage> *glances down* like hell they are
<LightTrooper105> o.o.
<JunkerKun> Sergio_Scriptor: Well, sadly, the most dangerous animal I've seen was a wild dog
<Sergio_Scriptor> JunkerKun: :D it could have rabies :P
<ofna01> Mirror, you should have a revolver
<ofna01> Go ahead, make mah day
<JunkerKun> Sergio_Scriptor: Good thing it didn't bite me
<Sergio_Scriptor> JunkerKun: indeed :)
<MirrorImage> nah, if anything i'd have a shotgun
<MirrorImage> my house is essentially one big hallways
<JunkerKun> MirrorImage: A shot with shotgun from a point blank range... mmmmm...
<MirrorImage> kind of hard to miss at 30ft with a shotgun when you can't move more than 2ft either direction
<Sergio_Scriptor> im also coming here during the week now cause i will no longer be hable to come here on saturday night :'(
<Ninjazz> That's unpleasant. :<
<JunkerKun> Sergio_Scriptor: Eh? Why?

<Herobrine> Mortal
<Barbetos|AtWork> ofna01: yeah. HeroBrine can be removed with a patch.
<Barbetos|AtWork> umad herobrine?
*Ninjazz applies Notch to Herobrine's forehead.
<Herobrine> I have never been removed, I am behind it all.
<ASoftFluffyThing> http://derpy.me/vc5mQ
<Herobrine> I am the reason you fear the night.
<Meanwhile> I thought Batman was the reason you fear the night.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yeah yeah. Keep telling your self that. I still see you cry at night and jump when you merely see the update screen.
<Barbetos|AtWork> ^
*Herobrine makes ground dissapear under Barb
<Barbetos|AtWork> Chat room physics are silly.
<Ninjazz> But Batman makes everything so much more better.
<Herobrine> Gods do not cry, Gods do not BLEED.
<Barbetos|AtWork> really enough with the rp.
<Ninjazz> Like a nice game of frisbe.
<ofna01> Lol
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh you, silly ofna01 *gives a cookie*

*Notch looks at Herobrine
<Gold_Demona> ofna01: Those of us who are using irc clients can see when you change names
<MirrorImage> ^
<Ninjazz> ^^
<Notch> MEh
<Gold_Demona> Notch: So we know it's you
<MirrorImage> of course, there's also /whois
<ofna01> Meh, i was bored.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Whats a birthday party? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzPoz2safPI&feature=player_detailpage#t=40s
<Barbetos|AtWork> Stupid link
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh well
<Barbetos|AtWork> still good video though
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wonder...
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://derpy.me/YolRR
<Barbetos|AtWork> That works
<ASoftFluffyThing> Barbetos|AtWork: Potter Puppet Pals! <3
<Barbetos|AtWork> That explains a lot about Ron honestly
<Barbetos|AtWork> That SINGLE phrase
<ASoftFluffyThing> What phrase?
<Barbetos|AtWork> "Whats a birthday party?"
<ASoftFluffyThing> Yep, Ron in all his loveable glory
<Barbetos|AtWork> That video has my other favorite line from the PPP series. "I don't care about your Grandmotha, I'm Harry Potta!"
<Barbetos|AtWork> Its so fun to just "I don't care about your X, I'm Harry Potter!"
<ASoftFluffyThing> And then I get to naked Dumbldore popping out the the cake and singing
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh Dumbles, you silly old man~
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol! I forgot about that
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nekkid tiem!
<ASoftFluffyThing> It's always nekkid tiem for Dumbldore
<ASoftFluffyThing> I saw the world premiere for Deathly Hallows when it was being shown in London, I think it was
<Barbetos|AtWork> Daniel Radcliffe actually talked about reenacting "Mysterious Ticking Noise" for a fund raiser in an interview once.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I don't think it ever came to fruition, but I would pay money for it
<ASoftFluffyThing> I think it would go along pretty good since a lot of Potterheads know it
<Gold_Demona> That would be awesome
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yeah. Both those things.
<ASoftFluffyThing> "I found the source of the ticking. It's a pipe bomb!" "Yaaaaaa--BOOOM"
<Barbetos|AtWork> they just need to happen at a place
<ASoftFluffyThing> And possibly do a livestream of it as well
<Barbetos|AtWork> Voldimort should of totally used some muggle technology. He would of totally won.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lol anyways at the premiere of Deathly Hallows, when Alan Rickman showed up the crowd was chanting "Snape! Snape! Severus Snape!"
<Barbetos|AtWork> I mean think about it.. how hard would it of been for him just to magic a nuke about to explode into Hogwarts?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh kay. Now I am glad I was not that author of the Harry Potter books. =\
<Barbetos|AtWork> Coffee gives me strange ideas, that seem to be extremely morbid
<ASoftFluffyThing> I don't think the nuke would work. Muggle objects tend to act wonky around Hogwarts, especially electronics.
<Barbetos|AtWork> True. Thats awesome about Alan Rickman btw XD
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wish I could of been there.
<Barbetos|AtWork> All the cool stuff happens in London.
<Barbetos|AtWork> But I have to live in Texas. <<
<ASoftFluffyThing> I know, right?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I sat there and watched it all. They also streamed it on Youtube on the Harry Potter channel
<ASoftFluffyThing> It was the priemere of DH part 2

<Serenity> Also, it only affects RAM
<Dr_Fumbles> I think I need to watch more HowToBasic. He'll show me how.

<Dr_Fumbles> MadSurge: No doubt.
<cachi01|phone> MadSurge indeed it is
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://derpy.me/P5ccz
<MadSurge> Not very scary though :D
<Dr_Fumbles> MadSurge: Yeah, I agree
<Dr_Fumbles> At least they are shifting to more action, which they are good at instead of endless jump scares
*Kurra starts quietly hugging peoples
<MadSurge> Dr_Fumbles: OOGA BOOGA
<Dr_Fumbles> AGHH!!!
<MadSurge> Heyo Kurra!
<Dr_Fumbles> Kurra: <_<

<Dr_Fumbles> And the ending will be its own $100 DLC
<cachi01|phone> Dr_Fumbles silly filly 3DS wont have dlc
<Dr_Fumbles> If its Capcom, they'll find a way
<Barbetos|AtWork> This Mega Man talk makes me want to get out my DS and play ZX
<MadSurge> I hate Megaman X continuity
<Dken2021> ah, I like that one, the sequel was...ok
<Dr_Fumbles> I hate the fact I have to buy a 3DS for new games...
<cachi01|phone> The only megaman for DS i have is that goddamn megaman battle network game :/
<Barbetos|AtWork> Never played that one
<cachi01|phone> Fucking shitty battle system...
<Dken2021> BN5?
<cachi01|phone> Yes
<Barbetos|AtWork> I never really played the Z series either, and I have number 4 I think

<Dken2021> I find it funny they made more cartridges than consoles for that game
<cachi01|phone> Didnt knew that
<Dken2021> yea, they though people would probably buy E.T twice
<Dr_Fumbles> But lets not forget the amazing Bubzy 3D. Better than any Elder Scroll game.
<cachi01|phone> But bronystate pls we all know superman 64 is way better than that crap of the legend of zelda.
<Dr_Fumbles> indeed :D
<cachi01|phone> Brb i must punish myself for saying that
<Dken2021> quite
<Dr_Fumbles> For those of you who don't know what Bubzy is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTAlr5raV2U&feature=plcp

<Serenity> Lil_B: I currently have 12 gb with 2g card and a 6 core i7 :)
<ekips> cachi01|phone ah thanks
<cachi01|phone> i7 is pretty fucking expensive
<TheMonstaMuffin> Heya im back!
<Serenity> 6 core costs a fucking country
<ekips> someone know on what server Wrek & Co are playing?
<MaxTheBrony> On what game?
<Serenity> Their own,
<cachi01|phone> ps2
<Serenity> Planetside
<ekips> planetside 2
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<MaxTheBrony> Yeah what server are they on :)
<Serenity> I have enough games atm
<Lil_B> Serenity wow, 2 grafics cards Oo I'll just use one, I have no multi monitor Setup anyway (although that would be nice in the future) but Grafics wise I only need it for gaming anyway XD
<Serenity> Lil_B: No, a 2gb GPU
<Barbetos|AtWork> ekips the servers recently got new names
<Barbetos|AtWork> and Wrek was playing yesterday but he did not say what sever
<Barbetos|AtWork> server. I forgot to ask too
<ekips> Lil_B how can one not have a multi monitor setup? I can't live without anymore
<ekips> Barbetos|AtWork that's why I'm asking
<Barbetos|AtWork> I am so glad I have my second monitor now
<ekips> I know he played on EU2 before
<Lil_B> Serenity GPU is the grafics card ... or do you mean a 2 core grafics card?
<Serenity> ekips: Since I'm at a 2200x1600, I don't need 2 monters
<Serenity> Lil_B: GPU is graphics processing unit
<Serenity> GB is the amount of memory it has
<Barbetos|AtWork> ekips try making characters on both eu servers and send friend request to Wrek, assuming he is using that name in game still of course.
<Barbetos|AtWork> that might work
<Sonny> Argh
<Serenity> Wish Bronystate had a Terraria server
<cachi01|phone> Guys i might get a pc with i3, idk what graphic card it has, 1TB memory, 8 GB ram. I wonder if i will be able to play amnesia without lag....

<Cades[Phone]> gtg cya
<Serenity> cachi01|phone: 1TB memory, jesus, what planet mate?
<Serenity> Lil_B: Yes.
<Bronysith> ekips: Wrek's name on planetside is boksy

<cachi01|phone> gaming.of course
<Bronysith> cachi01|phone: get urself a custom built gaming pc
<Lil_B> for gaming whis is quite enough actually, about midrange atm
<cachi01|phone> Bronysith my dad doesnt want to get a custom :/
<Everlasting_Joy> cachi01|phone: Is this going to be a laptop or home PC?
<cachi01|phone> Home pc
<Lil_B> I'll probably buy everything on alternate.de and assemble it myself with the help of someone
<cachi01|phone> We were going.to get an alienware but they are expensive
<Bronysith> alienware is the apple of gaming pcs
<Bronysith> expensive as hell
<arnoldschvartznegger> alienware, a gamers frind
<arnoldschvartznegger> friend*
<Bronysith> and not as good as other stuff
<cachi01|phone> i know....... But atleast they run every game
<cachi01|phone> I just want a pc that can handle every game. Because i bought garrys mod like 1 year ago and i havent been able to play it :/
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone oh... OH... please... get a cuzstom PC... it's gonna cheaper than an Alienware>.< (exyept if you really REALLY want the nice look
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<cachi01|phone> Alienwares look very beautiful :3
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone tehy do, but they< are WAY too expensive for what they do
<cachi01|phone> I still have 3 months to search for a pc.
<cachi01|phone> Or to get my dad to pay for a custom built one
<Bronysith> ;
<arnoldschvartznegger> Lil_B: my sisters boyfriend have one that costed him 23k kroner
<cachi01|phone> Btw guys whats the best graphic card?
<Bronysith> one that costs a shitload
<Lil_B> arnoldschvartznegger 23k kroner? in which country do you life?
<Bronysith> my graphics card cost me 500$
<arnoldschvartznegger> Lil_B: norway
<cachi01|phone> Bronysith holy shit
<cachi01|phone> Bronysith will an nvidia graphics card be cool enough to run tf2, portal 2, amnesia, and almost everything at almost 60 fps?
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone rule for grafics crads: Buy the best one you can efford: they are in such a huge variaty that you will always look at the one thats just a little bit more expensive and say to yourself (oh, just 20$ more for better performance!)
<Bronysith> cachi01|phone: im not one to talk to about that
<cachi01|phone> Faaak gettin a pc is hard :I
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone Nvidea GTX500 series or of you can effort it, GTX 600 series,
<Everlasting_Joy> cachi01|phone: It is.
<ekips> I really have to replace my old pc soon, this one's now nearly 6 years old :O
<Bronysith> i got stabbed for reading chronicles of narnia
<cachi01|phone> Lil_B which one is better? Amd or nvidia
<arnoldschvartznegger> ekips: mine was only 2 years old when it broke XD
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone yeah, getting a PC is very hard, but every purchase gets harder the higher the costs are :/ buying a car was to date my hardest purchase XD
<cachi01|phone> Lol
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone both are good, but as it is right now I'd go with nVidea
<Bronysith> d
<ekips> mine's still working, but begins to loose performance now (and is obviously outdated horribly)
<cachi01|phone> Ok apparently the gtx 590 is the fastest graphics card
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone AMD made some mistakes in there prozessors latly and they gonna have a hard time, and after that nvidea will probably cranck up there prices (intel and Nvidea are both overpricxed, but now that AMD is going down both have no competitors :/ )
<arnoldschvartznegger> Lil_B: my first pc was 2k kroner :P
<ekips> isnt't the gtx 690 the bestest atm?
<Lil_B> cachi01|phone for hardware tests I would suggest looking up Toms Hardware Store in the internets!
<cachi01|phone> Im in that site right now l
<cachi01|phone> Lol
<Lil_B> ekips probably, I don't think they have started 700 yet :/
<arnoldschvartznegger> the internets were not a single soul gets trough, the internets where you horrors and fears come true
<arnoldschvartznegger> XD
<ekips> they should, so I can afford a 6xx one Lil_B :D
<Lil_B> arnoldschvartznegger do you know how much kronen 1€ is? or the other way around?
<arnoldschvartznegger> Lil_B: ill check brb
*alexxm kidnaps ekips

<Everlasting_Joy> Barbetos|AtWork: I'd melt myself, but I'd be fine with it.
<Barbetos|AtWork> To clean the barbetos or... becuase of pinkie hug?
<AJIsAwesome> It would be too much happiness for me and I would pass out. :D

<Meanwhile> I wanna play a game.
<Kimori> yo
<Barbetos|AtWork> Lets play flip the table
<Barbetos|AtWork> Name something that makes you want to flip a table
<Barbetos|AtWork> Go
<Paspie> lol
<Serenity> Barbetos|AtWork: CoD players :3
<AJIsAwesome> Gangnam Style
<Shizuka> 13stupid people
<Serenity> ^ that too
<Bronysith> Shizuka: that one
<Serenity> Dammit, shizzy
*Barbetos|AtWork flips Shizuka.
<Shizuka> 13course stupid people make me want to blow up the world
<Shizuka> 13why stop at flipping tables
<Barbetos|AtWork> FUUUUU!!
<Meanwhile> True.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Bronysith> Shizuka: flip the table onto a nuke bomb
<Serenity> Shizuka: Because if you blew up the world, I wouldn't be here anymore
<arnoldschvartznegger> if i were to flipp this table, i would be in trouble XD
<Paspie> People who use their tongue to help flick through pages
<Serenity> Plus I would miss New Tricks :C
<Shizuka> 13that's easy bronysith, you just play with pogo sticks until someone hits the random h-bomb button
<Meanwhile> Humanity will probably blow itself up at some point anyway.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: lold
<Serenity> ^
<Serenity> GRR
<Bronysith> then commence
<Bronysith> VICTORY SCREECH
<Bronysith> OLOLOLLOLOLOLO
<AJIsAwesome> OLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<arnoldschvartznegger> why u so pissed Shizuka ?
*Serenity flips table with bricks on it at Bronysith
<Daring> what we watching? All Im seeing are ads for obama letting us down and russian girls wanting american bodies
<Paspie> Its always the unexpected that happens
<Barbetos|AtWork> Look. I am fine with the distruction of the world. I ask one thing before you do it though, send out season 1 of MLP FiM and Episodes 4 through 6. Destroy everything else
<Barbetos|AtWork> IF the universe gets anything from the world that should be it.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Episodes as in starwars
<Bronysith> Also poser nerds make me want to flip the table "Oh yea i played one game of magic, such a nerd" AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Meanwhile> I can think of better contributions to the universe than MLP to be perfectly honest.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: electricity?
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Cinderblocks?
<Meanwhile> I was thinking more like man's philosophical musings but sure that too.
<Serenity> Also, don't forget the cake
<Serenity> Never forget the cake.
<Serenity> Unless you want a certain peacekeeper to throw a thousand grenades at your house.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Meanwhile I know, but we only have so much time and limited space
<Barbetos|AtWork> It was the first things I had access to in my home!
<Bronysith> but anyways
<Bronysith> BACK TO THE TABLE
<Vivix> posers, idiots, fools and such do not piss me off
<Bronysith> People who dont know how to play a game of Texas hold em
<Bronysith> such as
<Meanwhile> I hope there's a horror movie marathon on halloween.
<Serenity> Who's Such?
<Vivix> elitists, anti casuals, and high ontheirself nerds piss me off
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh.. Hrm... people doing spaghetti stuff in the name of brony-dom.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Cabin in the woods
<cachi01|phone> YAY IM GETTING THIS PC! =D http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.mx/MLM-407939838-computadora-pc-nvidia-edition-ultimate-ed-series-intel-gamer-_JM#califications

<Serenity> Best freaking Horror film I watched
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<Bronysith> HEres me "i win i got 4 aces" "oh yea, i got 3 pairs"
<Bronysith> AHHHHHHHHHHHH
<arnoldschvartznegger> cachi01|phone: 10 grand?!
<Serenity> 10 fucking thousand dollars
<Serenity> WHAT
<cachi01|phone> 10,000 pesos
<cachi01|phone> Lol
<Serenity> (around 6.5k quid)
<cachi01|phone> 10,0
<Dken2021> cachi01|phone wow, a bit pricy there
<Meanwhile> Well have fun with that.
<Meanwhile> Not like you couldn't build one of equal standing for like half the price but whatever.
<cachi01|phone> Dken2021 10,000 pesos id like 1000 dollard
<Serenity> Ohh
<Serenity> Okay
<arnoldschvartznegger> cachi01|phone: hahahaha, you troll!
<Dken2021> oh, that's pesos
<cachi01|phone> Xd
<Serenity> So around 650 quid
<Serenity> Hmm, for what it is, I've seen worse.
<cachi01|phone> Check the specs
<cachi01|phone> Its awesome
<Serenity> 8gb ram, 1tb storage with a 1gb card and an i5
<Serenity> Crappest bit in there is the GPU
<cachi01|phone> well it says it can run skyrim :3
<Serenity> cachi01|phone: You can run Skyrim on 256mb
<Bronysith> anything can run skyrim
<Serenity> But here's the questionL
<Serenity> Can it run Crysis?
<Bronysith> oh fuck
<cachi01|phone> I hope so
<cachi01|phone> Let me check
<GilDash|Dinner> Holla everypony! :)
<Dken2021> aloha GilDash|Dinner
<Serenity> Eyyyy
<AJIsAwesome> hi GilDash|Dinner
<cachi01|phone> hi GilDash :)
<Meanwhile> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xECx-42Wlho
<Serenity> I've seen that
<Vivix> Crysis is kind of old, I don't think we should use it to judge computers
<Bronysith> everyone seen that
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<arnoldschvartznegger> EVERYONE
<MadSurge> Ohai GilDash|Dinner!
<AJIsAwesome> What?
<Vivix> I bet you al lthat I haven't seen it, but I won't click it-
<cachi01|phone> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtgOEXKh7Q&feature=youtube_gdata_player yes it can run crysis
<Serenity> Vivix: You don't understand the joke :P
<Meanwhile> It amuses me.
<Serenity> cachi01|phone: WOAH
<Vivix> Ah it was a joke
<Serenity> What computer are you using!?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Vivix: its called Metro 2033
<Vivix> I ran Metro on pentium 4 6800gtx
<Serenity> In it's time, Crysis was way way to demanding for even the bestest computers back then
<Vivix> I also ran Crysis on pentium 4
<cachi01|phone> Serenity that isnt me lol i just searched for a gameplay of crysis with that graphic.card
<Serenity> So the quote was, if it could run Crysis, it could run anything
<cachi01|phone> i dont have a pc ATM
<Vivix> I think I also ran GTA 4 on pentium 4, games just aren't very good at judging power of computer anymore-
<AJIsAwesome> DAT POST
<Vivix> of course the big difference visually is on the gcard
<MadSurge> Oh my god, Shizuka. That Demented Cartoon Movie Reference. Why are you so awesome? :$
<Shizuka> 13took you long enough..
<Shizuka> 13blah
<Bronysith> Shizuka: whats ur fav kind of muffin?
<AJIsAwesome> Hm?
<MadSurge> Shizuka: I was not at the computer :P
<Meanwhile> The kind that asks pointless questions.
<Bronysith> wow Shizuka you projected your voice through Meanwhile you are good
<Shizuka> 13favorite muffin
<Shizuka> 13raspberry
<MadSurge> Shizuka is best ventriloquist
<MadSurge> And Meanwhile is best Scarface :D
<Meanwhile> Never seen that movie.
<Serenity> I'm back
<AJIsAwesome> Same here
<Serenity> With toast
<Serenity> And pepsi
<Vivix> Me neither
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: the Batman Scarface
<Serenity> Now lets play a game.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Extreme confused spider is extremely confused. The little bastard just keeps running back and forth on my wall.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Not sure if I should reak out with him or not
<cachi01|phone> Is there any stream?
<Barbetos|AtWork> freak*
<Meanwhile> Oh right, the dude with the puppet.
<Serenity> Barbetos|AtWork: Leave it, he's keeping those flies out
<MadSurge> ^
<Serenity> Shizuka: Are you busy atm? :S
<ekips> leave the spider alone, it's your bro
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh I did not plan on killing it
<AJIsAwesome> ^^^
<Vivix> Never seen batman either-
<Shizuka> 13not particularly
<Serenity> Up for some TF2 of some description?
<Meanwhile> You should stream Atlas Shrugged.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I just think its acting strange for a spider
<Serenity> It's probably disoriented.
<Shizuka> 13i really should
<Barbetos|AtWork> stream geometry wars. << >>
<MadSurge> Vivix: one of Batman's minor villains is a guy called the Ventriloquist that is bullied around by his puppet Scarface, who's an old style gangster
<Vivix> Aah
<AJIsAwesome> Geometry Wars?
<Meanwhile> Everyone knows the best minor Batman villain is Calendar Man.
<arnoldschvartznegger> anyone here that can do french?!
<Serenity> N.
<Serenity> No.*
<AJIsAwesome> Mope
<Barbetos|AtWork> I can do the French guy from the Holy Grail, does the count?
<arnoldschvartznegger> ill keep asking until someone shows up
<Barbetos|AtWork> that*
<ekips> Je ne parle pas francais excuser moi
<cachi01|phone> Calendar Man is meh
<Dken2021> you sure it isn't the clock king?
<arnoldschvartznegger> ekips: lol
<Meanwhile> Calendar Man works on a bigger scale than Clock King. :P
<Serenity> Dken2021: Misread that ._.
<ekips> no seriously, that's the only thing I know in french from school
<cachi01|phone> Serenity xD
<Serenity> *Sprays brain bleach all over brain*
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/iBmZJ.jpg
<Serenity> Wow
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/bPd26.png
<Serenity> I just noticed that more than half of my photos on the wall are of dead family :L
<Meanwhile> Well that's a huge downer.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Bronysith> we need to get the Exorcist streamed up in here
<AJIsAwesome> That would be great. :D
<Bronysith> the scariest movie ever
<ekips> I'd still like to see Battlestar Galactica being streamed ^^
<Serenity> Cabin in the woods would be epic to stream
<Serenity> I found the mid to end hilarious
<Meanwhile> Exorcist isn't that scary.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: well i never seen it
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<Bronysith> saw
<Meanwhile> >Scariest movie ever
<Bronysith> never saw it
<Meanwhile> >never seen it.
<Meanwhile> Wat.
<Serenity> hehhehe
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i forgot to add the "supposed" part to it
<AJIsAwesome> It's more creepy than scary, IMO.
<Meanwhile> So are most horror films tbh.
<Serenity> Most horror films are only scary with jumpscares
<AJIsAwesome> Couldn't agree more.
<Meanwhile> In fact actually being scared by a horror film is something that only tends to happen when you're 12.
<Bronysith> ja
<Meanwhile> Jumpscares aren't even scary, they're startling.
<Serenity> ^
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<Bronysith> jumpscares are hilarious
<AJIsAwesome> Want a really scary movie? Watch The Leprechaun.
<Serenity> Want to watch a scary show?
<AJIsAwesome> *Sarcasm Detected*
<Meanwhile> Something happens that's gross or unsettling and sure maybe you feel weirded out, but very little that appears in a movie actually inspires fear.
<Serenity> Watch Jersey Shore
<Dken2021> or better yet, Leprechaun in Da Hood
<AJIsAwesome> ^ :D
<Meanwhile> Fuck that movie.
<Bronysith> what we need is a movie that makes u scared for reals
<Bronysith> not jumpscares
<AJIsAwesome> How was Mirrors? Has anyone seen it?
<Bronysith> that gets in your head and makes u legitimately hard for you to sleep at night without a machine gun
<Serenity> Bronysith: Kinda impossible without the film making the people release adrenaline and get the proper feeling they're fucked
<Serenity> It's gonna need 4D to get to that :3
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/r/funny/oiFR1
<Meanwhile> It's very hard to be genuinely scared by a movie, especially when you're not alone.
<Bronysith> ja
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<Bronysith> the only thing that can actually get you really scared are experiences
<Serenity> That's why 4D (interaction) are best choices
<Meanwhile> And unless anyone wants to invest in some sort of elaborate prank where we knock someone out put them in a mansion and all hide across the place disguised as zombies that's not likely to occur.

<cachi01|phone> Shiiiinyyyy
<CCCP> ekips implying they were ever :I
<StinkomanFan> Soooo, what're we watching?
<Shizuka> 13rand doesn't give much detail on how hank and lillian would have gotten together in the first place
<Dark_Horst> i'm impressed how this movie makes construction work look epic
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: do they need couple therapy?
<ekips> CCCP implying I...no, I won't start another "implying" war >.>
<Shizuka> 13they need quite a bit more than couples therapy :3
<CCCP> ekips :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Michael: once again, http://derpy.me/JqWF9
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: Exorcism, perhaps?
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<cachi01|phone> CCCP my grandma and my grandad really loved each other but then my grandfaer died
<Michael> Spectrum_Rush: dat teeth :D
<StinkomanFan> Seriously, what the hell are we watching?
<CCCP> Spectrum_Rush i liek braces <3
<Dark92Enigma> Nah, just some PSYCHIATRIC HELP
<StinkomanFan> ENGINEER IS SPY
<Shizuka> 13Dark_Horst: hey it *is* epic, humans do some crazy stuff :3
<CCCP> cachi01|phone :( im sorry
<Michael> Spectrum_Rush: http://i.imgur.com/5J9yC.jpg
<Shizuka> 13iirc when the 35W bridge collapsed up here in 07 they had a replacement up in like six months... OVER WINTER
<StinkomanFan> Seriously, nopony's answering my question
<Shizuka> 13StinkomanFan: it's a movie about a titan going meeeeh
<cachi01|phone> CCCP he died 1 year before i was born. And the weird thing is that my birthday is the same day as his
<Michael> StinkomanFan: a movie of unknown name
<Spectrum_Rush> Michael: a new challenger approaches http://derpy.me/mirYy
<Shizuka> 13obviously we're watching c-asp1-xvid
<cachi01|phone> xvid....
<MadSurge> Shizuka: funny how people assume Atlas carried the world on his shoulders :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: .avi
<Shizuka> 13avi is just the container
<Kurra> what is this movie even about, it's not Australium
<Dark_Horst> StinkomanFan: atlas shrugged part 1
<Spectrum_Rush> its still there =(
<Michael> http://derpy.me/aW9Qn
<Shizuka> 13also notice the headlines can't actually say anything concrete about rearden metal, they're just fearmongering
<Shizuka> 13i can't wait til part 3 to see what they do with the superweapon
<MadSurge> Kurra: It's basically CAPITALISM IS GOOD! The Movie
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: it's the butter-margarine ware all over again
<Shizuka> 13(because yes there's a superweapon in atlas shrugged)
<MadSurge> Shizuka: toxic titles? :D
<CCCP> btw what movie is this?
<StinkomanFan> AKA BIOSHOCK, ONLY BORING!
<MadSurge> ^^^^^^^
<Shizuka> 13bioshock, only actually based on the source
<Kurra> MadSurge, I don't really haet on capitalism, but I *do* keep from swinging gasoline trucks at the hornet's nest, then
<dynamo2814> ok im back
*Michael is falling asleep on the keyboard
<Ghost_Nappa> hiiii
<StinkomanFan> ...So... when are the plasmids gonna come in?
<Spectrum_Rush> Michael: http://derpy.me/vzRNP
<MadSurge> StinkomanFan: if only
<dynamo2814> playin minecraft you guys
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: what's bioshock supposed to be based on?
<Ghost_Nappa> minecraft?
<Michael> Spectrum_Rush: http://derpy.me/B4Ma4
<Spectrum_Rush> this
<StinkomanFan> No fire being thrown out of there hands? At least Crime and Punishment had an Ax murder!
<dynamo2814> cookin me some iron
<Shizuka> 13bioshock is loosely based on AS, rapture is an analogy for galt's gulch
<Dark_Horst> ah
<Shizuka> 13the similarities end there though
<MadSurge> Nope, it's all about idiotic politicians and Ayn Rand's author avatar
<Dark_Horst> what's galts gulch now?^^
<Spectrum_Rush> Michael , I... http://derpy.me/jd4fM
<Paspie> haha
<Michael> Spectrum_Rush: http://derpy.me/yQdgh
<Shizuka> 13the premise is that the world's producers are suddenly vanishing
<spitfirecolt> whats this shi
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm not a fan of that artist'sstyle
<Dark_Horst> sp..... they'r all disappearing to galts gulck, aka rapture?
<Shizuka> 13sort of
<Dark_Horst> oi
<Shizuka> 13it's hidden in the rockies, self-sufficient
<Kurra> this movie seems only to be about lawyers.
<Ghost_Nappa> ?
*Kurra goes pick up a filter
<Bronysith> Ghost_Nappa:
<Bronysith> hello nappa
<Ghost_Nappa> hii
<Shizuka> 13bioshock's rapture diverges from the morals of atlas shrugged in that no one in rapture has the slimmest grasp of economics
<StinkomanFan> This is why Bioshock was considered a classic but Ayn Rand's just considered a preachy bitch
<Bronysith> we are comparing a book to a game
<Shizuka> 13because economics is overrated?
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: literally
<Bronysith> i wish we had more smart people in economics
<Shizuka> 13the problem with rapture is the merchants drive prices up simply because they can (which is what the game wants you to walk away with)
<Ghost_Nappa> wats this
<Obsidian> Hey guys , what are we watching?
<Ghost_Nappa> yeah wat are we watching
<StinkomanFan> Because the game is fun for everypony but Ayn Rand is dull for everypony
<StinkomanFan> Atlus Shrugged Pt 1
<MadSurge> And everyone thinks for themselves, thinking they can go on without cohesion between the various economical parts of the city
<Shizuka> 13in reality, a price that's too high would drive your market away to competitors
<Michael> ohai Obsidian
<Shizuka> 13MadSurge: you've never seen patterns emerge in nature have you..
<MadSurge> Shizuka: mmm?
<Shizuka> 13thing is, if you act in your own self-interest, you're more likely to take action that indirectly benefits others
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3r18ca#by=ad
<Shizuka> 13rearden is out for himself making his metal, which will make him quite a lot of money
<Shizuka> 13in the process, people that buy the metal get a damn good product
<Ghost_Nappa> AJIsAwesome: 3DS friend codes?
<AJIsAwesome> Hold on a second.
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: this movie, however seems more realistic than Richie Rich...in that film, it was said that if the enviroment is safe, the job will be easier, and there will be no mistakes. Did any character did any mistake here?
<Shizuka> 13the problem with rapture is the merchants driving prices up didn't bother to consider that would start impairing their business
<Shizuka> 13a competent business will charge you as much as they can but not a penny more, else you'll go somewhere else
<Dark92Enigma> My point is, regardless the safety of a job's enviroment, THERE WILL BE MISTAKES, even when not intended
<Shizuka> 13yep
<alexxm> so what is this movie
<StinkomanFan> I thought the problem was because Ryan forgot to cut off connections to the surface.
<Shizuka> 13there's probably that too
<Kimori> hii
<MadSurge> Shizuka: I mean that everyone in rapture thought they could be capitalists, without considering that they need people to build/repair/clean stuff
<Shizuka> 13point is bioshock takes an extremely narrow view of "acting in your own self-interest", ignoring the fact that your self-interest includes not dying
<Ghost_Nappa> llooll
<Ghost_Nappa> cmon AJ u almost ready?
