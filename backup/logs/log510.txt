<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Last time mom saw this last night, she spotted Twinkies on the store shelf.

<StupidSexyCJ> Pittsburgh: whaa??
*Nick offers next poster a wish
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'll be shifting players after this movie.
<Pittsburgh> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Contrary to popular belief, the supermarket scene was not filmed at an actual supermarket. A movie set was built from scratch to look like a real supermarket, and some of the merchandise is fake. For example, the stuff behind the glass refrigerator doors is just printed on paper. According to the producers, it was cheaper than buying out a supermarket and paying
<Pittsburgh> 1,11them for broken merchandise.
<DashWithRainbows> Why throw away the bat?
<String_Shredder> hey Tallahasse, play the "May I Help You" riff!

*Nick combusts from the Sun "IM BURRRNIIIIIIIING!"

<Bronysith> WHAT IF he pulled the trigger?

<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> TAAAAANK!
<Pittsburgh> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The script, originally a television pilot, was heavily revised to become a feature film.

<sagas> Start working on that 3 part apology :D
<RAWRity> Since they're not "zombies" so much as they are "hyper-aggreisive plague victims"
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> In B4 good song =D
<MadSurge> RAWRity: because they're still alive people, right?
<Pittsburgh> 1,11Bronysith: it said Double Tap

<Bronysith> Lucid: swords are great. they never run out of ammo right sergio_scriptor
<Lucid> Well, for one, you have to get extremely close. Two, you have to be trained to use them effectivly. Three, most swords you can buy are cheap replicas that won't work very well. Four, they can be hard to sharpen. Five, machetes and crowbars are just better
<TheWeirdPony> lol
<MadSurge> BADASS

<inkBot> sagas, they aren't that funny either =P
<TheWeirdPony> i am terrified of clowns
<Pittsburgh> 1,11Actually, Tallehasse takes up the best defensive position in a theme park: Protected from all sides, slots for blasting zombies outside, and a "reload station" that makes it take literally 3 seconds to reload.
<Sundaysmile> honk
<Maseo> i cant stand clowns
<Meanwhile> And frankly after Steven King's IT I hate clowns too.
<Maseo> i dont mind the people out of costume

<Nyst> Yes, but it has no exit.

<Bronysith> Pittsburgh: its a double edged sword if you think about it
<Obsidian|LasPegasus> Me neither
<derpy_pony> what about the double tap?
<Lambo> Oh, look: It is the movie where Abigail Breslin was still cute
<inkBot> sagas, me neither.

<IshBestPony> NOW KISS (and repopulate)
<Lucid> A longsword? Please. The thing would be so heavy that it is even harder to use then a regular sword, not to mention slow. As for a shield and gladius, do you know just how heavy a roman shield is?

<sagas> but its a b movie so its okay
<otakon> XD
<kidzrul434> SCREW THE MOVIE SHOW THE PONIES
<ZombieBrony> Judging by IMDB this movie is bad

<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> sagas: but its so twisted and messed up
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: why did you tab yourself?
<Ictiv> Pittsburgh: Wait... Is this the one where the sheep is killing people?
<MadSurge> Pittsburgh: can't be more fucked up than 4chan.

<Meanwhile> One guy had an aneurysm during the showing.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> no clue
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: it's a film noir style movie that was STRAIGHT to video starring ALL kids.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> sergio_scriptor: it's probably somewhere in between.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fair warning: You may never looks at sheep again after this film.
<Ictiv> MadSurge: If I'm right. T4chan grew off this film.

<SpeedyBolt> Ponies can play instruments without fingers :p
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Even though the settlers need the land to grow their orchard, it's true that the land really does belong to the Buffaloes. And the settlers really don't have any historic claim to the land.
<RaveBrony> O_O

<Obsidian> Bye Pittsburgh
<Ponies47> Bye Pittsburgh :)
<red_ony> After seeing this episode I feel the urge to buy a hat
<Canadian_brony> cya Pittsburgh
<RaveBrony> RainBowJack: :$
<pony_300> GRRRRRR
<sagas> Canadian_brony: Not if they always used pies
<RaveBrony> Grrrr!!

<Lil_B> Stop kicking these Trees... they have feelings too!
<Ponies47> I LOVE THAT LINE!
<Saigneur> BAAAA AAAAA , it's sheep
<kidzrul434> SHE SAYD BODY INSTEAD OF PONY
<Juniterio> OMG
<sagas> No one is ever rational and reasonable
<AJIsAwesome> TWILIGHT's attack was lowered!
<Nyst> It doesn't help that the land is really lacking in natural resources. I think it's mentioned that the orchard is in the only piece of fertile land around.
<RaveBrony> Its the end of the worlddd!!! Oh NOess!!
<Michael> pies are best weapons
<Canadian_brony> Lil_B they aren't kicking, they're buckin'
<Ponomony> piie
<kidzrul434> pffft screw gravity
<pony_300> Fuck tha buffalo, we're BAKING PIES
<CCCP> pie = best weapon
<Obsidian> Intense pie making
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Frankly, a better deal would've involved the buffaloes stampeding over the other land to make it usable for growing crops. Then the buffaloes get their entire ancestral homeland while the Aplloossians have land to maintain the orchard... although this means that all of the trees would have to be relocated.
<Pony_Zen> so... they can't move dem trees, because then they wouldn't have anything to eat... Yet they have enough to prepare a whole cavalry worth iof pies to serve as weapons.
<RaveBrony> CCCP: Ofc!!!
<[SWAG]Haku> It cant be the only fertile soil around, what do the buffalos eat then?
<sagas> Nyst: I know. I dont see why the buffalo have a valid point
<Ponies47> BONK!
<Pony_Zen> mushy stuff
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I misread lurk

<CCCP> RaveBrony: ? lol

<Nyst> Also an interesting point is that this shows that pony civilisation is exapansive; they're building new colonies and are expanding their borders, even into other species' land.
<WorldTraveler> its the only FLAT land.... so y u no just make the land flat?
<Juniterio> its not

<otakon> kirzstryfe: YES!
*Drake now has a crater for a face.
<IowaBrony> Yes!
<GilDash> Om: I'm not sure what answer you're looking for... ;)
<otakon> GODDAMN KICKBOTS
<DeathStar> kirzstryfe: do you know when they are doing starwars?
<Barbetos> kirzstryfe oh nice.
<Espeon> Why do I find the idea of an Umbreon dropkicking anything cute
<otakon> OH COME ONE! GODDAMIT KICK BOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Espeon> dropkicks aren't supposed to be cute
<otakon> hiya DeathStar how are you today?

<Om> GilDash: You don't? Well, cant say I'm supprised. With that big head n' all.
<Viri> 14o.o
<Jim> Have only seen the first Toy Story
<sagas> kirzstryfe: They better include the prequals!
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> Jim: =/
<Angel_Umbreon> 13on a rating from "kinda cute" to "KAWAII DESU", how would you rate it? :D
*Angel_Umbreon runs
<Barbetos> Just as long as its not the prequels. If it is the prequels we should watch the red letter media versions.
<CCCP> lalallala
<Barbetos> It will make it better.
<CCCP> Im like a cactus but im not a dog!! :o
<Drake> 04I would rate it "Your face"
<GilDash> Om: I'mma let that comment slide. :)
<alexxm> kirzstryfe what about terminator
<Angel_Umbreon> 13that's a rather subjective rating
<Angel_Umbreon> 13is my face high or low on the scale? ;3
<junh1024-XD> ohohoho
<Drake> 04I'll let you decide ;3
<Om> GilDash: I'll just have to, prod a bit more hmm? I haz cookies :3
<otakon> EYEBROWS!
<Nyria> otakon: Oh god your kickbot shenanigans are so funny~
<otakon> http://www.animegalleries.net/img/54167
<killerpony7733> Om very subtle :D
<Om> killerpony7733: What was?
<Espeon> I rate it "Angel_Umbreon"
<otakon> Nyria: I'm so glad my misfortunes at being a fast short typer GIVE YOU THE GIGGLES!
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> otakon: someone just divided by 0
<killerpony7733> Om that temptation
<otakon> Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG: What about eyebrows?
<Om> killerpony7733: The cookeis?
<Nyria> otakon: You can always limit your messages~ x3
<killerpony7733> Om Aye
<Om> They are good, but you shant be tempted by them.
*sagas is eating another cheese stick :)
<otakon> Nyria: then I wouldn't be able to reply
<sagas> tasty, tasty cheese
<Angel_Umbreon> 13still a subjective rating D:
*Nyria shrugs at otakon~
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> gasp... sagas backwards is sagas
<Rukario> rated e
<Rukario> for espeon
<Om> I need some good cheese.
<GilDash> Om: ... What kind of cookies?
<sagas> Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG: Anagram magic!
*Ninjazz slides in and gives Om some cheese
<Espeon> misread subjective as suggestive somehow. Angel_Umbreon as a suggestive rating.
<Barbetos> What with the sliding?
<Rukario> lol
<Nyria> For style I guess~
<Espeon> not sure how this works or how it's related to cuteness
<Espeon> but idc
<Angel_Umbreon> 13;D
<Barbetos> Surfing is better.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13it works both ways
<Om> GilDash: Chocolate. Well, they are technically cokie bars, just large, slabs of cookie.
<Angel_Umbreon> 13and yes, that's what she said
*Barbetos uses Ninjazz's gliding and surfs on him
<Barbetos> gliding?
<pony_300> gonna bail out now for sum sleeps. Enjoyed the movienight! Cheerz
<Barbetos> sliding is better.
<sagas> Barbetos: That is epic, good sir
<Om> Ninjazz|AFK: Thank you
<Nijazz|AFK> ^-^
<GilDash> Om: Not some nice chocolate chip then? :S
<junh1024-XD> that's what you said!
<Espeon> that's what bre said.
<junh1024-XD> suggestiveness and cuteness are both related to moe, after all
<Drake> 04Angel is a suggestive rating
<Angel_Umbreon> 13:3c
<Espeon> suggestiveness and cuteness makes for a functional combination.
<Om> GilDash: Oh, its nice~ the cocolate gets on my fingers and around my mouth tho, still warm and moist.
<Drake> 04Indeed
<junh1024-XD> called moe
<Wrek> 05howssat?
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> Om: : L
<GilDash> Om: You're gonna get told off in a minute...
<Om> GilDash: Why? Its chocolate. And they are fresh. Best time to eat them
<GilDash> Om: Chocolate is chocolate, not cookies, silly. :p
<Wrek> 05damn this place is empty
<alexxm> looks good to me Wrek

<Barbetos> Vordox Sprite Isaac Clarke
<GilDash> Om: Chocolate isn't cookies. :D

*Barbetos shrugs
<Om> GilDash: Stop being so pickey, you just jelly I haz cookies~

<killerpony7733> Om i don't mind i can always buy REAL cookies
<alexxm> thanks otakon
<flutter_spin> His image might have changed ever so slightly as I wrote the story, but its still the base
<otakon> alexxm: np
<Om> killerpony7733: These are REAL cookies. I made them silly
<killerpony7733> Om and maybe i'll get some for GilDash too :D
<otakon> damn now I'm bored
<NullRadix> dear Bronystate. I've probably said something similar before, but... I dont' know if exercise is an anti-depressent or if I'm just addicted, but it's a helluva drug
<otakon> NullRadix: you're loony
<NullRadix> why thank you
<flutter_spin> http://mylittlepixel.deviantart.com/gallery/?set=35477057&offset=0 if you want inspiration
<otakon> NullRadix: exercise hurts us, yes it does precious *GOLLUM, GOLLUM*
<NullRadix> pain is weakness leaving the body!
<GilDash> NullRadix: I'd hardly say that's a bad thing. :)
<NullRadix> also, it stops hurting once you've conditioned yourself
<flutter_spin> I was going to attempt doing a sprite or draw my OC... but I'm busy rewriting my story
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> im bored =/ someone say something funny
<Om> Bronystate is best drug
<NullRadix> unless you continue to push yourself like a madman
<otakon> NullRadix: then when I did those burnouts several years ago and COULDN'T MOVE THE NEXT DAY I should have been damn near invulnerable...
<prince-lemon> Well I'm sure I heard somewhere that exercise releases endorphins
<flutter_spin> Besides, I have jotted down some ideas for my third story. I'm just holding back
<GilDash> NullRadix: Then you just condition yourself further. :)
<DeathStar> Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG: something funny
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> prince-lemon: i laughed..
<Chrysalis> prince-lemon as do lemons
<CCCP> lol i like sloooow chats :)
<prince-lemon> So it is enjoyable, and to a certain extent 'addictive' to some people
<flutter_spin> I'm trying to do more with Ninjazz, but I just don't care for "Night Star"
<otakon> hiya prince-lemon how are you today? also, your bot has kicked me goddamn twice today and like 6 times yesterday have you changed your settings?
<GabeMoist> Ohai
<alexxm> so what do you guys think of next weeks movies
<prince-lemon> I haven't changed any settings
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> alexxm: kinda boring
<prince-lemon> And I've had a good day thanks
<flutter_spin> "Ninja Star" hehe.
<alexxm> hey GabeMoist hows your day been
<prince-lemon> I was looking around Olly's Uni.
<otakon> alexxm: the B will be a instant WMC if they can actually FIND a copy of it on the net.
<GabeMoist> ok
<Ninjazz> flutter_spin, clever. :3
<Om> GilDash: You are showing so much restraint :) good it. Whos a good it :3
<otakon> prince-lemon: nice and hiya GabeMoist YOU WON!
<flutter_spin> Came up with Bladester or the like.
<GilDash> Om: The mods are all around me. :S
<GabeMoist> otakon, I won a new car?
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> otakon: apparently Nittany loves movies that appear to have no info
<alexxm> otakon from what i see it has no wikipedia page
<otakon> GabeMoist: no, A movie!
<flutter_spin> I'll think of it more as I develop the plot. I still like the idea of the two being brothers.
<GabeMoist> Sweet
<otakon> alexxm: it has a website
<Om> GilDash: The mods are nice people :) why so worried?
<otakon> You guys want the B movie website?
<GabeMoist> What's the B Movie?
<killerpony7733> Om GilDash knows restraint when theres need for it
<otakon> it's really horrible to be honest
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> its funny how ppl that win the lottery... arent in the chat during the lottery
<killerpony7733> :)
<flutter_spin> I want the third story to revolve around Cloudsdale. I feel like throwing in some more pegasi
<GilDash> Om: killerpony7733 has more sense then you ever will. :p
<NullRadix> I was in chat the one time I won the lottery... for a pony episode...
<Om> killerpony7733: Yes. But need is such a strong word
<NullRadix> well... i think I was playing a game cuz it was eurostream
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> NullRadix: i respect you
<GabeMoist> Are we finally watching the animated titanic movies for B Movie?
<flutter_spin> I love the miniWrek there in the corner
<NullRadix> but I was hereish!
*junh1024-XD f2k takayan - Last battle (2chFLAC@992kbps/2:47)

<Pinkies4thWall> And i had the time of my life

<GabeMoist> The most I ever spent at a bronymeet was $0

<flutter_spin> In all seriousness, I haven't had a time where I just left to do some meeting like that... not even a concert
<String_Shredder> sombody call Scoot-Scootaloo's wallet an Amber Lamps
<GabeMoist> Dear Princess Celestia, I'm so alone

<sagas> Ive only ever purchased one mlp/Brony item
<Pinkies4thWall> Also at this meet the public relations staff for BroNYCon showed up, as well as a few of the guys from Brohoof Brony. It was SO great
*sagas hugs GabeMoist
<flutter_spin> blind bags. That's it for me. Close to purchasing a 'brony' t-shirt at the mall but I didn't like it.
<Chimera> you calling Angel cute?

<Saturn> 08,01wow, wrek

<Vordox> You wanted a Full scratch like Wrek? :P
<flutter_spin> any program you used?
<GabeMoist> Saturn, of course it is, It's Wrek
<sagas> Saturn: its Wrek. Of course its gonna be good
<Vordox> flutter_spin: Can't tell what Program I use, it's Illegal XD
<flutter_spin> lol
<sagas> Vordox: illegal?
<Vordox> sagas: Yes and no....Borrowed.:P
<GabeMoist> Vordox got compies of Paint off the black market
<flutter_spin> Like how I borrow games from my cousin.
<sagas> Vordox: I know that feel. I use a pirated photoshop CS6
<Vordox> GabeMoist: Kinda. :P
<Vordox> Sagas: Bah, only newbs uses EZShop Adobe
<Vordox> Real pro uses MSPaint
<flutter_spin> This song. ^^
<Om> That horn looks like it would hurt.
<GabeMoist> I have Photoshop CS13
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> i have Photoshop CS3... =/
<sagas> Vordox: well that hurts deep
<sagas> GabeMoist: The non-existent one?
<GabeMoist> No, I got it from the future
<Saturn> 08,01Om: don't piss off Britannia
<Vordox> Sagas: It's true, why do you think everyone and their Boss uses Photoshp, cause it's "good"? :p
<GilDash> Om: Wanna give it a try? ;)
<DeathStar> Saturn: that's some sound advice there
<Saturn> 08,01i think tomorrow I'll dye my jeans
<Om> Saturn: I'm american, damage has been done.
<flutter_spin> lol. I thought it would take hours to do, but you just did it like a couple minutes. Then again, I did want to do like a trottle also.
<Saturn> 08,01Om: ha! <3
<Vordox> A trott?
<Vordox> ...
<Om> GilDash: Try what I ask? Getting skewerd?
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> whats with the brony pirates =/

<GabeMoist> Saturn, http://mirk.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/all_hail_britannia.jpg
<CCCP> hi Vordox

<Vordox> Bah, I haven't done any scratch walk yet.
<Vordox> Hai CCCP
<flutter_spin> yeah a trott. That word still bugs me, but I guess that is what is used.
<Jim> Wow, I got my butt kicked in Worms
<Saturn> 08,01GabeMoist: tee hee

<Ponies47> Hey cow334 Wrek
<sagas> Saturn: We are why you arent West Germany
<Big_Macintosh_1992> oh no... hope nobody tried to talk to me... left the page open and left the computer...
<Saturn> 08,01inb4 "we saved your ass in World War 2"
<Saturn> 08,01oh, just missed it
<Saturn> 08,01well
<GabeMoist> Saturn, ninja'd
<sagas> Saturn: so close
<flutter_spin> I started playing Black Ops and I just couldn't stop laughing. "How did brony CCCP get his own missile?"
<Saturn> 08,01inb4 "we ssaved yours in WW3"
<Om> GilDash: Getting stabed is still getting stabed, no matter how polite you want to be.
<Ponies47> BRB
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> Saturn: =/\
<sagas> Saturn: Well not yet of course
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: and we could have handled those Krauts fine ourselves, thank you very much
<Saturn> 08,01we were doing just fine

<CCCP> bye
<Vordox> Jeebus...
<red_ony> I am not following the stream much atm. So excuse me if this is an obvious question..what song is playing right now
<sagas> Saturn: Yes, while huddled together in a bunker getting fire-bombed
<red_ony> ?
<Ninjazz> To bed.
<Vordox> flutter_spin: Those trots look HARD to do O.o
<GilDash> Om: Tsk, I'd never stab you. :)
<flutter_spin> yeah Vordox :P
<Om> Ninjazz: lol
<Vordox> flutter_spin: I guess I'll not do it for this time. >< That looks WAY too hard to even modify D:
<Ninjazz> Om, :3c
<Saturn> 08,01this band sounds like what would happen if someone gave Matt Bellamy a labotomy
<Saturn> 08,01which band is it?
<flutter_spin> You might be able to pull the sprite from the file and recolor each frame Vordox
<Vordox> Well one modified sprite is enough, wanted to try something hard and your OC hair was a mess. XD
<Saturn> 08,01i like the instrumentals, and the lyrics
<Om> GilDash: No, you would never do anything like that would you.
<GabeMoist> Saturn, if it weren't for us revolting and making our own country, America's government would be in yours
<Saturn> 08,01i just can't stand the guy's voice, though
<Vordox> flutter_spin: I know, I'm looking at each one now
<sagas> Saturn: If not for us, Germany would only have to play a waiting game of attrition for Britain to fall
<Om> Ninjazz: Fight the powah!
<flutter_spin> I thought about doing it, but wasn't motivated.
<GilDash> Om: Of course I wouldn't. :(
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: in all honest, i actually know *nothing* about history
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> From chocolate discussions... to War discussions
<flutter_spin> Like how I stopped after 500 words in chapter 5 of my story. I felt like taking a break.
<red_ony> aaaw
<red_ony> song ended
<sagas> Saturn: But its okay. Im glad we saved you
<red_ony> still dont know title
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, someone tell me what band that was
<red_ony> :/+
<Om> GilDash: Especially not with a horn?
<flutter_spin> Audioslave? Saturn?
<sagas> Saturn: Germans dont sound very fun
<GilDash> sagas: Germany was already spreading itself too thin by that point. Their supplies weren't getting to them fast enough. In reality, it could have been close either way.
<Ninjazz> Om, RO RO FIGHT DA POWAH!
<GabeMoist> Germans are the most fun people
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: i love germans
<GabeMoist> you speak lies sagas
<Ninjazz> Zos Vacky Germans
<DeathStar> I think my cat is feeling cold...
<flutter_spin> A friend of mine loved Audioslave and wouldn't stop talking about the album. I know them very well.
<Saturn> 08,01last year i spent my summer in Germany, and that was one of th emost fun summers i've ever had
<Om> Huray for being part german, even my last name is german.
<red_ony> Guten Abend.. What is tghis talk about Germany?

<Jim> Germans are fun to dance with
<red_ony> Where have you been saturn?
<sagas> Saturn: This is how they get you!
<Saturn> 08,01i found out that most germans have terrible taste in music
<Om> GilDash: I know you would never hurt anyone :) don't be silly
<Saturn> 08,01Vi Vi being the obvious exception
<GabeMoist> define terrible
<sagas> Germans: Fun to dance with but not a funny bone in there body

<Om> GilDash: Why? She has sexy in her name.
<Ninjazz> GilDash, I absolutely love her voice.
<flutter_spin> At least it isn't manly Spitfire
<Chrysalis> Saturn youd better make it up to us buck goers and get a sexy VA in
<Chrysalis> :P
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: ahem
<Saturn> 08,01John de fucking Lancie

<Chrysalis> yes, but he is godly, not sexy

<flutter_spin> :P
<Saturn> 08,01to quote our treasurer: VOICE. LIKE. TREACLE.
<MysteryGuitarDash> Get's stuck to your eyebrows?
<Saturn> 08,01MysteryGuitarDash: basically
<sagas> May I post a video link since its only Wrek drawing?
<GilDash> Saturn: Now if you were Picard, I can't see you getting annoyed with de Lancie in your bed. :D
<MysteryGuitarDash> Why did i put an apostrophe in that sentce? :S
<Saturn> 08,01MysteryGuitarDash: wait, why are you putting treacle in your eyebrows?
<GabeMoist> sagas, nope
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: well spotted
<MysteryGuitarDash> No reason 0-0
<String_Shredder> Saturn: why are you not?
<flutter_spin> We could just get someone ... saxy http://vocaroo.com/i/s0XIxGklfDJr :P
<Saturn> 08,01MysteryGuitarDash: you're either very silly, or very kinky
<sagas> GabeMoist: Awwwe but there isnt much to watch atm

<GilDash> Saturn: I've got an eye for these kinds of things. ;)
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> flutter_spin: i dont get it
<flutter_spin> its saxypretender
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: if you want to post a video link, ask Wrek, since he's streaming
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> flutter_spin: ohhhhhhhh
<Om> GilDash: I think it has little to do with your eyees
<Saturn> 08,01flutter_spin: no audio links either, please
<flutter_spin> That might have been a bit borderline.. .yeah I was just typing that.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Saxy sounds like me O_O
<sagas> Even though I doubt hes watching the chat, Wrek may I post a video link in the chat?
<Saturn> 08,01Scoot-Scootaloo: saxy does not sound like you

<Saturn> 08,01saxy has a sexy, southern voice
<GabeMoist> wat
<Ponies47> ^
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03But he's from New York...
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> Derp
<GilDash> Om: Hey, I've got eyes like a hawk. The only person finding out damned tent pegs when we were packing up was me. :D
<Shimmer> sagas: Wrek rarely allows such things, almost no point asking :p
<Darkts3|Ohioan|MLG> Ikr
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Wait, aren't you talking about Slurry?
<MysteryGuitarDash> GilDash: As long as you don't have eyebrows like a hawk. And get treacle stuck in them.
<sagas> Shimmer: Awwwwee
<Saturn> 08,01oh
<Saturn> 08,01wait
<Saturn> 08,01yes
<GabeMoist> Doh
<sagas> But I wanna post sexy spitfire voice!
<Om> GilDash: Is that all you can find is small things?
<Saturn> 08,01i was thinking about slurry
<GilDash> MysteryGuitarDash: No, because that would just be silly. Hawks don't have eyebrows.
<Saturn> 08,01slurry's voice is magical
<GabeMoist> silly Saturn
<flutter_spin> yeah, me too sagas
<MysteryGuitarDash> But my mummy said so

<String_Shredder> Saturn: better call Guiness World Records for it to be official
<sagas> Honestly, look it up. Swedish spitfire's voice sure is sexy!

<icybeauti> Ponies47: Did you give him the welcome wagon?
<Wrek> 05give me a sec to translate

<flutter_spin> http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=Lyra+comic#/d523l17
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: i was going to use it as a pencil holder

<sagas> Saturn: Nope
<Ponies47> *They
<Om> GilDash: You are always ready for everything arent cha?
<sagas> Saturn: A few Lyra plushies but not THE Lyra plushie
<icybeauti> Ponies47: If they do, give them the welcome wagon.
<Saturn> 08,01also, i'm seriously considering getting a pair of slippers made: one with lyra's head, one with bonbon's head, on them
<Ponies47> icybeauti: Well of coarse! Pinkie Pie's welcome song. :)
<GilDash> Om: Usually. It's how I roll. :)
<Jim> That'd be so awesome
<GabeMoist> Saturn, why are you decapitating ponies? D:
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> that Lyra Puppet is the strangest thing to come from bronies
<sagas> Saturn: That would be awesome!
<Saturn> 08,01like this, but Lyra and Bon Bon: http://img.alibaba.com/img/pb/798/508/367/367508798_446.jpg
<Ninjazz> Saturn, that sounds a little scary, tbh. But I'm sure it's actually really awesome.
<icybeauti> Ponies47: I wish that had been around when I first joined the herd.....
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: epic win
<Ponies47> icybeauti: What had been around?
<Om> GilDash: Hmm, yes it is. Not always to the point tho xD
<Saturn> 08,01when i first thought about it, i had to stop work and leave the building because i was laughing hysterically for a full 5 minutes
<icybeauti> Ponies47: The welcome wagon

<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: I'm taken by this, it's extrodinary. It's very much your work, and I'm impressed with it very much.
<flutter_spin> And I always wondered how one person could draw all of Castle Crashers too, sheesh
<icybeauti> Sorry, watching old streams lol
<MadSurge> R-Dash5000: Gilardi is going in weird places with this story :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: If I came across as offensive with that previous statement, I'm sorry.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6./msg
<flutter_spin> *shrugs* I'll never be good at anything. Still a blank flank I guess at heart.
<Wrek> 05i was jsut suprised by your reaction :P

<String_Shredder> thanks
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek chat has been quiet?
<MadSurge> Don't be like that flutter_spin :(
*Rain is enjoying the stream too much to talk
*DeathStar dances
<Barbetos> Where did this chat box thingy come from?
<flutter_spin> ehhhh. I made my story revolve around me. It hits me home at heart
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Fair enough :). I'm just so use to being amazed by your art, and to see this piece, which has that 3D effect, just goes to show the talent you have.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Barbetos: From the Unknown
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: There's a reason my dA signature says "you artists make me so jelous."
<Barbetos> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG ... We must kill it with fire then. o_o
<flutter_spin> Sort of became this 'I am what I need to be' type of cutie mark
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Barbetos: mmmhmmm
<flutter_spin> jack of all trades, eh?
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> any fallout fan here?
<flutter_spin> I guess its because I work in a pizza place and my family doesn't like that at all.
<Saturn> 08,01flutter_spin: they don't like pizza?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i am sad
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Aren't we all Fallout fans?

<Om> GilDash: You sleepin
<flutter_spin> I've never played Fallout
<Saturn> 08,01flutter_spin: well... why are you throwing your life away for minimum wage?

<GilDash> Om: Aye. I sleep, unlike some ponies. :)
<Om> GilDash: Boooooooring >_<

<Chains> Saturn LOL
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: Huzzah!
<MadSurge> Saturn: You're Pinkie with a beard! :D
<killerpony7733> Ponies47: Jedi Academy was a very superior version of the outcast series i mean it does have little less important character that drives it but the fact you can level up either dark or light side powers and will eventually get the choice of choosing light saber styles or types like dual sabers or double edged saber made it so great
<MahBoi777> mmmmmm pumpkins :P
<killerpony7733> Sorry for that wall text :D
<Saturn> 08,01heh, when i have it tied back in a rather aptly named ponytail, it *really* does look like pinkie's tail

*Irish_Pony misses Gamer_Luna too much :'(
<killerpony7733> Ponies47: oddly the most diverse light saber type was one due to the ability to choose inbetween all light saber fighting styles light/medium/haevy
*Ninjazz devides the pumpkin into six equal parts

<Pinkies4thWall> no seizures yet
<epichsagea> CBUK
<cow334> sagas: she is awesome but i think she gets over used
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: do u feel anything else?
<icybeauti> DeathStar: Of course.
<sagas> So this is going on a t-shirt, Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: acronym, and it looked nicer as BUCK
<Chains> Right now, in says "Brony United Convention Kingdom"
<sagas> cow334: alright fair enough
<Saturn> 08,01sagas: eeyup
<Pinkies4thWall> MahBoi777: my whole head is feeling bass hits
<otakon> Bronies United Kingdom Convention
<sagas> Nice
<Pinkies4thWall> MY
<otakon> or B.U.K.C.
<Pinkies4thWall> WHIOLE
<Chrysalis> Saturn i didnt question that
<cow334> sagas: and the fact that like almost
<Pinkies4thWall> HEAD
<Saturn> 08,01Chains: no, it says Brony UK Convention, and it's shortened to BUCK
<Chains> otakon: That would be BUKC!
<epichsagea> omfg he has to the backround? ffs
<otakon> pronounced Buck
<Pinkies4thWall> *whole
<AJIsAwesome> When's the convention?
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: VERY interesting
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: i meant that at chains
<killerpony7733> Saturn thats awesome sadly i hardly have money for that else i would just think about going to it ;)
<otakon> Chains: yeah but PRONOUNCED buck
<icybeauti> Who cares? The shirt looks buckmazing and it probably took hours to make.
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: August 18th and 19th in Manchester
<Chains> otakon: But written BUKC.
<sagas> cow334: almost what?
<AJIsAwesome> Sweet!
<otakon> Chains: yeah
<Chains> I'm a grammar nazi. I do not approve of BUCK.
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: have you started puking rainbows yet?
<AJIsAwesome> Give him time.
<Pinkies4thWall> on the other hand, i'm killing my headphones' battery at a killer rate
<cow334> sagas: PEOPLE think they can talk exatly like derpy just because they can make THERE VOICE SOUND LIKE THEY ARE RETARDS
<sagas> That pony looks like a Sea Pony
<kirzstryfe> 8,6you're a troll and you whine a lot
<epichsagea> BuCk
<Pinkies4thWall> MahBoi777: have you seen the shirt?
<AJIsAwesome> Who?
<Biglaw> ohai kirzstryfe!
<Chains> Wait, is it Brony United Cingdom Konvention?
<cow334> kirzstryfe: me?
<Chains> ...
<icybeauti> I unerstand the rage you have grammar nazis because i am one myself, but wouldn't Bukc look a little weird?
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: lol yes
<Chains> Because, if it was, I'd shut up.
<AJIsAwesome> icybeauti: yes.
<Saturn> 08,01okay, i want to clear something up here: It's Brony UK Convention, but it's shortened to BUCK. It's not an acronym, it's a modification. It used to be an acronym, until Derpy swapped the letters around.
<icybeauti> Man, whenever I type in this place, I typo like hell :P
<sagas> cow334: Well she is taken to be clumsey/ditzey. Thats just how the fandom has characterized her
<Saturn> 08,01and it's now stuck like that
<Pinkies4thWall> OH GOD
<cow334> sagas: eh i guess
<Pinkies4thWall> Not save derpy
<Biglaw> Derpy!!!!
<icybeauti> Oh crud....

<Biglaw> Celestia save the Queen! Wait....
<sagas> cow334: She is heavy on the physical humor, but she also has her sparks of brilliance
<Saturn> 08,01Chains: this happened a while ago
<Pinkies4thWall> save derpy can make people cry if they have sensitive dispositions
<epichsagea> dont stuff it in your face
<epichsagea> dont stuff it in your mouth
<Chains> Saturn: But Wrek JUST wrote it!
<killerpony7733> Chains: you can't take a joke?
<Saturn> 08,01Chains: yes, he wrote it because that's what it's called. it's called that because of Derpy
<cow334> sagas: yeah
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> want to go to BUCK only to meet with all the guys from bronystate, too bad i can't :p

<Saturn> 08,01Chains: okay. let's go through this again. about 6 months ago, I decided to start a convention. when deciding on a name, Brony UK Convention was decided upon, which was shortened to BUKC, but then Derpy changed the letters round to BUCK, and it stuck
<Om> Panda-: Know that feel

<Panda-> is san diego near there icybeauti?
