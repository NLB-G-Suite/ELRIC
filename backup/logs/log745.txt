*Jageman spits it out
<Gunthler> I'm scared .-.
<CriticKitten> Vordox: But really, the suit is a legit one. They argue that Blizzard's not doing enough to prevent hacking (which is true) and that their default answer of "just get an authenticator" is requiring the purchase of another product in order to bring their product reasonable security.
<HoodyNinja> Nittany_Discord: Halo 4
<DoctoDoctorWho> Depressed crystal ponies r CUTE.
<DocSane> Twilight? Seriously? Fracking TWILIGHT?!

<Gunthler> SB HALP O.O
<Vordox> As I said, I have my opinion, but I do not disagree
<CriticKitten> Vordox: If Blizzard had just sent the game with an authenticator on hand, they'd have been fine. But no, they CHARGE you for it. That's *stupid*.

<cachi01> she is not an earth pony
<cachi01> neither a unicorn
<cachi01> or a pegasus
<cachi01> she is a pinkie pie
<ShadowQuill> Oh
<Scoot-Scootaloo> G1 was MLG~
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Diary of a Silent Tyrant
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's an insult to G1, Scoot-Scootaloo
<DinkyDoo> They were originally gonna make Pinkie Pie a Pegasus, but they decided to make her a Earth Pony and gave her wings to Fluttershy.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you apologize right now
<Ponies47> G1 O3O
<DemoPegono> SLAPPITY SLAP!
<Yahooz> At least he didnt say that about G2
<RhinoSquadPony> whats it this time?
<Yahooz> or i woulda been pissed off
<cachi01> you have fucked up now
<AJIsAwesome> I thought G2 was only toys, right?
<Shammy> ,pp[
<cachi01> G2 sucked
<ShadowQuill> Now you fucked up
<CrimsonPhoenix> DinkyDoo, you mean she has in Lauren
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: G2 had a show
<Shammy> moop...
<AJIsAwesome> Or did it have a show?
<cachi01> pony teens....
<DinkyDoo> Without G1, there wouldn't be any My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> SaxyPretender: Oh yeah well you're an insult to MLG's >: (
<cachi01> oh god
<RhinoSquadPony> all the last generations were dogshit.
<Jageman> cachi01: true. She can teleport and see the future, would make sense that she was a genetic mutation
<cachi01> g1 was fine
<AJIsAwesome> I thought the ponies in school were technically still G1.
<cachi01> g2 sucked
<Ponies47> G1 is mah second favotite :3
<DocSane> AJIsAwesome: It was only toys. Most people mistakenly call My Little Pony Tales G2.
<cachi01> g3 is bullshit
<cachi01> g3.5 is satan's work
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Good, MLG sucks, yo :3
<sub06905> g3.6 <3
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: :D
<sub06905> :>
<thelonepony> sub06905: :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14If I'm insulting it, I'm doing something right!
<ShadowQuill> What will be G4.5 or G5?
<Canadian_Brony> THANK YOU!!!
<RhinoSquadPony> when I say My Little Pony, people think im talking about the last generation shit.
<DocSane> Honestly, most of MLP has always been kind of terrible.
<Ponies47> What about Littlest Pet Shop? Dat show is awesome! 030
<Canadian_Brony> Saxy's got the right idea!
<Vordox> WHO HERE PLAYED ME3?
<RhinoSquadPony> its not as good
<CrimsonPhoenix> G4.5 the CMC adventures
<Jageman> cachi01: Just imagine all the genetic codes it takes for a single species to have so much variations.
<RhinoSquadPony> what game is being played?
<cachi01> ShadowQuill: http://www.luxlotus.com/photos/ya_lyublu_i_love_russian_/russianvogue_pinkpony.jpg
<DocSane> CrimsonPhoenix: I wouldn't mind that.
<cachi01> ShadowQuill: thats g5
<Ponies47> CrimsonPhoenix: Dat would be cool
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSGWoXDFM64 <--- For those who played ME3... Is this song familiar to you?
<DinkyDoo> CMC vs Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, DocSane.
<RhinoSquadPony> what game is being played?
<cachi01> the buffer show
<MahBoi777> YAY
<ShadowQuill> Suddenly, BronyState is thread simulator! What do?
<DocSane> I remember when the fans really disliked the CMC.
<Canadian_Brony> There is no stream..
<AJIsAwesome> There is none, RhinoSquadPony.
<Buytoast> It's all over
<Ponies47> Dat buffer show O3O
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: cmc would lose
<thelonepony> I wub the Buffer show :3
<RhinoSquadPony> i love buffer show
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> ShadowQuill, not everyone in here visit 4chan
<cachi01> ShadowQuill: laugh my ass off
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Night everyone.
<DocSane> Jageman: Yeah, but you know it would be adorable.
<AJIsAwesome> It's on its ninth season! :3

<Slater> Night Nittany_Discord
<thelonepony> Night Nittany_Discord :)
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Nittany_Discord
<ShadowQuill> CrimsonPhoenix: I just watch thread simulators
<Kandarihu> Man, I swear. If the CMC don't get their cutie marks soon, it's gonna be awkward if their voice actors grow into young women, and their characters are still little fillies who are STILL trying to discover themselves.
<Ponies47> Nighty night Nittany_Discord
<CrimsonPhoenix> ShadowQuill, IWTCIRD
<RhinoSquadPony> Well, lookie what we got here, brother of mine, it's the same in every townPonies with thirsty throats, dry tongues, and not a drop of cider to be foundMaybe they're not aware that there's really no need for this teary despair
<cachi01> Kandarihu: VA are 13-15
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: when we find out Mips kidnapper, right?
<CrimsonPhoenix> ShadowQuill, I hope you mean the good 50 seconds one
<cachi01> Kandarihu: years old*
<RhinoSquadPony> for taste BEAR?!
<CrimsonPhoenix> the rest are all stupid
<[SWAG]Haku> HAKU IS BACK
<Jageman> DocSane: ya
<cachi01> Kandarihu: so that is not going to happen soon
<ShadowQuill> CrimsonPhoenix: Which one is that?
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: We do? :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'll link it to you in PM
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: believe so
*Ponies47 Dances
<thelonepony> :3
<AJIsAwesome> Sweet! :3
*thelonepony dances with Ponies47 :3
<Kandarihu> cachi01, so they were about 10-12 when they started?
<DocSane> Folks, we have to be realistic: if there is a series 4, it'll probably be the last one.
<RhinoSquadPony> That the key that they need to solve this sad cider shortage you and I will share
<RhinoSquadPony> Well you've got opportunityIn this very community
<DocSane> 78 episodes would be a VERY successful run for an American cartoon.
<cachi01> Kandarihu: i think so
*Jageman jumps into the teleporter and teleports to the chat room
<ShadowQuill> DocSane: The Simpsons?
<cachi01> Kandarihu: but yeah iirc michelle is 14
<RhinoSquadPony> I hope they dont pull a Simpsons and keep the show in 30 years from now
<Jageman> The Cannon overloaded
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<AJIsAwesome> *^^
<DocSane> ShadowQuill: The Simpsons is barely watchable now. I haven't watched it in years.
<cachi01> and im 14......... yay theres hope lol
<DinkyDoo> Hes flim hes flam we're the world famous flim flam brothers!! (I wanted to say this..)
<Kandarihu> That tears it. They MUST get their Cutie Marks this season! They've been stagnating too long
*thelonepony tackles Jageman when he comes from the teleporter :3
<thelonepony> he/she*
<RhinoSquadPony> Scoot's CM will be a shotgun. I just know it.

<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: :D
*Jageman lays on the ground wondering what just happened
<thelonepony> :D
<RhinoSquadPony> Nonpareil, and that's exactly the reason why, you seeNo pony else in this whole place will give you such a chance to be where you need to beAnd that's a new world, with tons of ciderFresh squeezed and ready for drinking
<DocSane> Everyone knows what the CMC's talents are. Everyone except themselves.
<thelonepony> Jageman: you just glomped :3
<AJIsAwesome> ^^

<thelonepony> Jageman: well, thats what a glomp is, a tackle hug :3
<DinkyDoo> I doubt that!
<pony_max> and saw the third season:D
<Kandarihu> I can totally imagine a filly getting stuck into an arranged marriage situation and her cutie mark becoming the face of her betrothed if she ever accepts the marriage as her fate.
<Jageman> thelonepony: Have you ever been glomped in real life, it really hurts
<flutterchu> i feel like there's only 4 poeple here

<Eli> RAWRity: don't think that rule is still active
<Socks> Hello guiz :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai Socks :3
<prince-dari> S3 spoils are still in effect until 24 hours after the episode has aired IIRC
<prince-dari> Obviously during the eps they aren't#

<Socks> :D
<Deacon> because it got annoying after a day
<prince-dari> Gyrobowl is the one true God
<MadSurge> ^
<Jmo> Gryobowl is a false god, only gek is the true god.
<Jmo> Betch.
<Kandarihu> pony_330905, it was a forced meme, and it got really annoying.
<Socks> The G word now counts as spam :D I love the world!

<AdamTheDuck> "The website rulesoftheinternet.com[14] has listed it as a sub-rule of Rule 34."
<AdamTheDuck> " On Urban Dictionary, searching for ponify redirects to the entries for Rule 42[22] and Rule 85[15], which are also referenced in the Tv Tropes entry."
<Engi> That website is wrong
<Engi> What's the number of the toho one

<PillowPoni|Phone> I only own one pair of heels and its for formal events
<aniderp> i would break my neck.. sorta not good on balance..
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> is it Dominos or Pizza hut or Little Caesars?!

<Shizuka> 13Dumori is the only other user in the last three months that uses the same network this twit is using
<kimplix> well that worked
<Smiles08> Each circle is like a different gradient.
<Vordox> RELEASE ME, FIEND!

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good afternoon everyone
<AdamTheDuck> Hello there TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Smiles08> Hello!
<kimplix> good evening
<alexxm> sup TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<alexxm> how've you been kimplix
<BladedWings> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<kimplix> i've been good
<Shizuka> 13bronystate i have a task for you
<Kurra> yes?
*Vordox salutes at Shizuka
<kimplix> how bout you alexxm?
<BladedWings> what up Shizuka ?
<AdamTheDuck> o.o A task?
<Kurra> SEEK OUT THE HOBBITS
<Smiles08> The black screen... it's... so...
<Smiles08> Dark.
<alexxm> i'm good kimplix
<Kurra> BRING THEM AND THE RING.
<kimplix> nice to know alexxm
<Shizuka> 13if anyone sees Dumori or Dumorimasodaa anytime soon, ask him if he used a mobile irc last month and if so which network
<Kurra> :D
<Vordox> Will try and remember
<kimplix> anyway, where was i....
<kimplix> ah
<Shizuka> 13and/or if anyone hears Dumori say he's banned, pass it along to us because he should be exempted while on that network
<alexxm> how come Shizuka
<Smiles08> The "i" in mips is orange.
<Smiles08> While the rest are blue.
<Shizuka> 13hopefully it's the last we see of the twit that kept evading today
<Shizuka> 13now to free up some ban slots
<Smiles08> The ".tv" is orange too.
<kimplix> i got the applejack, applebloom, big mac, mr carrot cake, mrs carrot cake, pinkie, octavia, spitfire, dj pon-3, miss cheerlie, snips and bon bon
<Kurra> there's limited ban slots??
<Shizuka> 13not terribly limited
<kimplix> mrs cake*
<Shizuka> 13it's in the hundreds at least
<Jageman> Orders Recieved
<Shizuka> 13but we have lots of bans
<AdamTheDuck> Smiles08, "Your powers of observation continue to serve you well."
<kimplix> why did i say mrs carrot cake is a mystery
<Smiles08> Sombra likes stairs.
<Jageman> I'm sure half of the bans where meme related
<kimplix> stairs and sombreros
<Shizuka> 13many of them are just old
<Shizuka> 13but a permanent ban is a permanent ban
<kimplix> indeed
<Shizuka> 13the +L you see in the channel modes gives us access to a much longer list of bans, but when it comes to episode premieres we can even run up against that
<Jageman> what is the maximum amount of time a temporary ban can last?
<prince-dari> Forever minus a day
<AdamTheDuck> Dat prince-dari
<kimplix> 3? 5? i donno
<AdamTheDuck> and ohai prince-dari.
<Smiles08> Anyone watch kyrospawn?
<kimplix> wut?
<kimplix> what's that?
<Jageman> is there a limit on temp bans?
<Jageman> or are all bans counted the same?
<prince-dari> Temp bans are just bans that we remove at some point. :P
<Shizuka> 13if by temp ban you mean a time ban, we remove those, or have timers on our clients that automatically do
<Buytoast> there can be no end
<Jageman> so temp bans count towards the ban limit?
<Asuka> for instance say hi to my other irssi on my server
<kimplix> i've seen temp bans that lead up to december 31st 9999
<Shizuka> 13only so long as they're active
<Shizuka> 13observe
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Asuka
<Jageman> please no
<Alchemist> :D
<Shizuka> 13and in ten seconds you'll see my client unban
<kimplix> 10
<Shizuka> 13ten longest seconds ever amirite
<kimplix> yup
<Asuka> and poof!
<kimplix> wb
<Alchemist> XD
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back Asuka :D
<kimplix> seems more than 10 seconds btw
<Asuka> i should register or group this but i don't have any bot work planned
<kimplix> i've counted
<Jageman> I though you were going to make an example out of me.
<Jageman> I got scared
<Shizuka> 13mfw irssi doesn't accept message on /quit
<prince-dari> Lawl Jageman
<Shizuka> 13anyway
<Shizuka> 13and now you know:3
<Jageman> prince-dari: I'm the noob, i don't know how things work here yet.
*Jageman sits in a corner and tries to calm down.
<DinkyDoo> Hi everypony!
<BladedWings> hi DinkyDoo
<Smiles08> I'm nood too.
<kimplix> hello dinkydoo
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: Hi dinky

<Smiles08> See, can't even spell.
<DinkyDoo> Hello Jageman, Kimplix, and BladedWings :)
<kimplix> ._.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai DinkyDoo
<Shizuka> 13the one downside to irssi is manually unbanning
<kimplix> well that was a fast admin
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya DinkyDoo :)
<Sonny> AdamTheDuck: doing stream again, join if you like ^^
*AdamTheDuck licks Sonny :P
<Shizuka> 13dari and the others use clients that put bans in a nice list you can click on
<DinkyDoo> Hi AdamTheDuck and MLP_Brovakiin
<AdamTheDuck> Sonny, nah I'm heading off to school soon
*Sonny licks AdamTheDuck
<Sonny> ok bye
<kimplix> o...k
<Jageman> does this chat room have auto kicking?
<shana> Shizuka: quit does take a message
<kimplix> yes
<BladedWings> bye AdamTheDuck
<Shizuka> 13yeah but irssi doesn't pass it along
<kimplix> try saying g.a.k without the dots
<RhinoSquadPony> it still remembers my name!
<Smiles08> Nah.
<Jageman> irssi?
<DinkyDoo> Was there a stream before I came?
<Shizuka> 13/quit foo! resulted in [14:56] *** Asuka [asuka@r-70-62-149-175.hsd5.mn.comcast.net] has quit [Client Quit]
<RhinoSquadPony> Quake 4 was last night
<Smiles08> g&a&k
<Smiles08> No dots, see?
<RhinoSquadPony> ga kupo
<kimplix> u'll be surprised what will happen
<AdamTheDuck> Well anyway, another relaxing song for everyone before I head off. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkwVjUseLEU
<AdamTheDuck> And I bid you farewell BronyState. :)
<Smiles08> Good bye :)
<Shizuka> 13though irssi's man says that /quit does take a message....
<DinkyDoo> Sweetie Bell scares me now..
<Shizuka> 13maybe just doesn't like bangs..
<RoboGerbil> http://derpy.me/ucYXh
<shana> guess that would qualify as a bug Shizuka
<kimplix> did anyone listen to the backgeound music of s3?
<Smiles08> YES.
<kimplix> background*

<Smiles08> That buffer circle is going round... and round...
<Shizuka> 13doesn't seem to pass the quit message into the command
<Shizuka> 13that's odd
<DinkyDoo> Is Jageman still here?
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: Ya
<prince-dari> Is irssi open source?
<Smiles08> white fabulousness is better than all that.
<RhinoSquadPony> If Rainbow Dash was Duke Nukem, would she say "Hail to Princell Celestia, baby!"
<DinkyDoo> Jageman: Oh.

<Jageman> DashWithRainbows: Oh, That make sense, It is 40 degrees outside

<TROctavia> Jageman: Ohh. Yeah, it gets cold in flagstaff

<Jageman> TROctavia: Im thinking of manhatten
<kimplix> lol
<Bear> Insanity is doing the same BUCKING thing over and over again and expecting shit to change.
<TROctavia> Jageman: LI was formed by glaciers in the ice age so its really hilly in some areas. and manhattan is crowded as hell
<DinkyDoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9_I8egbYIg
<Jageman> TROctavia: Sounds beautiful
<Bear> That is crazy.
<DinkyDoo> Just watch the video..
<Invi> i wonder whan FiW 8 comes out
<Jageman> I love seeing natural formations like that
<TROctavia> Jageman: Once you go east of Nassau County (about 1/4th into the island), it gets pretty peaceful
<DinkyDoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9_I8egbYIg
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: try not to double post links
<DinkyDoo> Jageman: Okay.
<TROctavia> Jageman: There are some pretty interesting features here. rocky north shore, smooth sandy south shore
<TROctavia> mini islands out at the eastern forks
<DinkyDoo> Just watch the video, its sad.. (For me at least..)
<Jageman> TROctavia: sounds like a nice place to live

<Jageman> TROctavia: no really, i was 1 year too young to gamble
<DinkyDoo> And i'm not even kidding, I can't go one day without crying anymore.
<TROctavia> Jageman: I guess your parents were going north to the GC and then they got to Rt 40 and said Lol, nope
<Jageman> TROctavia: no, my uncle got free hotel rooms and invited us
<Jageman> TROctavia: all he had to do was sit through a 2 hour timeshare lecture
<twilight_sprinkle> MAH BOI
*twilight_sprinkle glomps MahBoi777 :3
<TROctavia> Jageman: Yeah, that's what my parents did so I could go to arizona lol

<VenHur> Hello everypony, I'm The Guy That Loves Tacos!
<MahBoi777> hai VenHur
<MadSurge> Ohai VenHur!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, VenHur. :)
<Jageman> TROctavia: I'm dumb sometimes
<DinkyDoo> I freaking hate my life ever since my grandpa died...
<shizumobile> Haibane renmei ost
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> VenHur: Im George Dubbya and I approve this message...Tacos Rule. :D
<TROctavia> Jageman: I 40 is a major interstate road that connects Las Vegas to Flagstaff
<DinkyDoo> I mean, not HATE my life.. I just feel like it was my fault..
<Jageman> TROctavia: is that the road that crosses the dam?
<Mihoshika> That scares me every time...
<DinkyDoo> OMG the stream scared me
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> Oh my
<MadSurge> :O
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> ...
<DinkyDoo> O_O...
<MadSurge> Game?
<Jageman> TROctavia: I don't drive west much
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> Ooooh
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates November 13 (Afternoon)
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> Raven and Activision.

<Mihoshika> Again...?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> CAKE 4...everypony! :D
<MadSurge> Yay, Quake 4!
<Kandarihu> That close-up of that raven's eye reminded me of Toothless
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> My favorite Raven game is Jedi Outcast. :3
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Kandarihu: lol same here
<shizumobile> When last we left citizen strogg, we became a strogg
<DinkyDoo> BRB..
<Jageman> TROctavia: i mostly end up going south to phoenix, that is where most of my family is
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Suddenly Quake!
<TROctavia> Jageman: Actually, you'd be on I 40 until you got to Kingman
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Awesome.
<shizumobile> Now we are fleeing for our lives
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> Quack 4 Duckers Revenge!
<TROctavia> Jageman: I see. Phoenix and scottsdale are pretty fun
<killerpony7733> Yay quake
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Stream now has my full attention
<MahBoi777> not the teeth! D:
<Jageman> TROctavia: ya, but vegas is better
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Yes the teeth!
<Jageman> TROctavia: mostly becaue it reminds me of fallout
<Streetlight> brushie brushie!
<BladedWings> ooo quake!
<TROctavia> Jageman: lmao
<MahBoi777> Nuuuuuuuu!
<TROctavia> Jageman: And its Rt 93 that takes you over the Dam if im not mistaken
<DinkyDoo> Back..
<Jageman> TROctavia: it was
<Jageman> TROctavia: they built a new bridge
<DinkyDoo> They should be playing Portal instead..
<Jageman> TROctavia: i saw part of it go up when i went through to vegas
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: More Ponies at Pizza Hut
<MadSurge> shizumobile: looked up haibane renmei, now I'm intrigued. Thanks for bringing it up :)
<TROctavia> Jageman: You prolly went over an access road if you were on the actual dam
<RawketLawnchair> Shoot 'em with your zappy gun!
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Elevator action
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> RawketLawnchair: lol is that an Awesome Center reference?
<MahBoi777> woo!! elevators YEAH!
<DinkyDoo> Is it possible to get over somebody's death?
<Jageman> TROctavia: i don't really remember, I have a damaged memory
<TROctavia> Jageman: I've never been to LV though lol. So i'm just going off of what i remember seeing on a map
<Streetlight> One of those topics that just comes out of nowhere
<RawketLawnchair> It's always the red barrels.
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: only time can heal that wound.
<DinkyDoo> My grandpa has died last year, and i'm still not over it.
<RaveBrony> Wait woah, what game is this??
<Dark_Horst> quake
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: its different for everyone, take all the time you need
<DinkyDoo> My grandpa's death didn't leave me a wound, it left me a scar.
<Dark_Horst> forgot the number though
<RaveBrony> Interesting
<shizumobile> Anyone hear the heartbeat
<MahBoi777> hi RaveBrony! ^_^
<RaveBrony> Hey there, MahBoi777! : D
<Dark_Horst> and you probably just filled upm your health from somebodies ballsac
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Dat heartbeat
<TROctavia> wat
<MahBoi777> thump thump
<Streetlight> Your Heartbeat Song, Its good but its not the one, we're singing out of tune, but I still want to sing with you :D
<Dark_Horst> that'S one big heart
<TROctavia> yet it isn't kind
<IshPonyPonyThePony> oh hello there ponies
<TROctavia> that big heart has a very small heart
<Streetlight> hi
<pony_6585> 6_9
<MadSurge> Oh god what
<BladedWings> hi IshPonyPonyThePony
<MahBoi777> hello IshPonyPonyThePony!
<MadSurge> Hey IshPonyPonyThePony!
<Jageman> what kind of fool would use organic components when mechanical alternative would be longer lasting
<IshPonyPonyThePony> bye everypony
<Dark_Horst> Jageman: strogg would
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, RaveBrony. :)
<Jageman> Dark_Horst: oh
<shizumobile> Oh just wait
<MahBoi777> bye IshPonyPonyThePony!
<Invi> Jageman, it's less expensive and repairs itself
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Organic parts were popular in these kinds of games at the time for some reason
<RaveBrony> Hey AJIsAwesome :P
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Prey did it too.
<killerpony7733> Jageman That's how strogg work. They use organic material for some reason.
<Streetlight> short but sweet :)
<MahBoi777> hi AJIsAwesome^^
<Jageman> Invi: untill it gets sick
<CountDoofus> Evening, bronies.
<MahBoi777> hai CountDoofus
<Jageman> Invi: an engineered virus would wipe everything out
<Streetlight> lots of generic pony nicks popping up :P
<Dark_Horst> ded
<Alchemist> oooooh, Quake 4?
<killerpony7733> Jageman Considering the stroggs extremely advanced technology and all. They no doubt could have ways of preventing organic decay
<shizumobile> I broke it, time to run!
<thelonepony> Ho Everypony :)
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: You, ok. You seem quiet.
<thelonepony> Hi*
<DinkyDoo> Jageman: No, i'm crying right now..
<Invi> Jageman, how do you know they don't develop an antidote oa vaccine for that
<MahBoi777> Ho thelonepony! :D
<BladedWings> hi thelonepony
<thelonepony> MahBoi777: :D
<Invi> hay thelonepony
<Jageman> Invi: Viruses change and adapt
*thelonepony hugs MahBoi777 BladedWings And Invi :3
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya thelonepony :) *huggles* :3
*MahBoi777 hugs thelonepony back :)
<Jageman> Invi: a good virus would attack the immune system, like hiv
*thelonepony hugs MLP_Brovakiin :3
<Mutterguy|27|SLP> I think I got to experience the partial solar eclipse. The only way i could tell was the rooms and the sky were darker than usual
*BladedWings hugs DinkyDoo "it'll be ok"
<Jageman> Invi: then a vaccine would not work, because the antibodies would be dead
<DinkyDoo> I'm gonna watch Youtube videos.. youtube makes me happy..
<killerpony7733> That's what quake 4 has for it. Your guns actually got better and upgraded as you play through it. So it keeps fresh
<pony_6585> quake ?
<Alchemist> Shizu do you play on PC or Xbox?
<Invi> Jageman, when you can hype up that virus power that much, a vaccine is able to develop comparable power. and since these aliens are further developed in organic technology than their enemies, they'd have an advantage
<killerpony7733> Alchemist PC obviously
<Alchemist> killerpony7733: obviously? Quake 4 was on Xbox 360 too.
<thelonepony> pony_6585: Quake 4
<PillowPoni|Phone> Jaymoo <3
<killerpony7733> Alchemist Yes but shizu plays on PC
<Jageman> Invi: viruses mutate randomly, they would have to catch it early inorder to keep up
<Jmo> Fluffeh~ <3
<pony_6585> Cool<3
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> You really shouldn't be playing a FPS on anything other than a PC, with a few exceptions
<killerpony7733> And it's obviously PC if you take your time to notice
<shizumobile> I hope you will forgive me abusing give ammo like crazy on this gun
<Invi> Jageman, wha if they develop a virus for the virus so the countervirus wipes the virus out
<Dark_Horst> i think that'S what crysis 2 did
*Nittany_Discord 11,01brushes BRUSHYOURTEETH
<Jageman> viruses are not alive, they can not attack each other, they can only counteract each other in the host cell
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Brushie Brushie~
<Streetlight> Colgate
<weeping_pegasi82> that gun is giving me lag :P
<Jageman> Invi: like a virus that makes the host cell immune to the first virus
*Bronysith puts Nittany_Discord in an aquafresh maid corset
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is fresh
<Jageman> Invi: but then if that virus mutates, you would have two uncontroled viruses running arround
<Invi> Jageman, yeah but they have the technology to build a giant heart pumping whatever through a living ship. i guess a human engeneered virus wouldnt do much harm
<Jageman> Invi: why not
<alexxm> Invi we don't know what their biolgly's like though i presume
<Rocket> hello everypony
<Rocket> sup ?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Rocket. :)
<thelonepony> Hi Rocket :)
<killerpony7733> inb4 he ded
<thelonepony> Ohai AJIsAwesome :3
<Rocket> hi :)
<Alchemist> alexxm: well, they turn humans into cyborgs so we can assume their biology matches ours.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Rocket
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, thelonepony! :)
<pony_numbers> doom?
<Jageman> Invi: the only way i can see a virus being uneffective is if they have a different type of dna
<alexxm> how are things Rocket
<Alchemist> pony_numbers: almost
<thelonepony> S[runkls, where are you >.>
<Alchemist> pony_numbers: Quake 4
<Jageman> Invi: like xna
<pony_numbers> oh
<Rocket> good thanks, and you ?
<thelonepony> Sprunkls*
<Invi> Jageman, what does the x stand for?
<Jageman> Invi: xeno
<Dark_Horst> that was anticlimatic
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Boss fi-oh okay
<Jageman> Invi: "XNA (Xeno Nucleic Acid) artificial replication/transcription polymerases starting generally from T7 RNA polymerase"
<killerpony7733> Alchemist Actually it's more of using human parts and what not. They sometimes makes things that requires a much larger amount of organic material to fit and all.
<killerpony7733> Alchemist I think it's cause humans are in a large abundance and all which is why they use em.
<Invi> Jageman, I see. i just looked up an article about that in rsc.org
<Jageman> Invi: Science is awesome
<Alchemist> killerpony7733: hmm, maybe they are using special cells to encourage cell growth (stem cells eg) --y massive, controlled and fine tuned biomasses?
<Alchemist> --y = -->
<Invi> Jageman, indeed
<Jageman> Alchemist: there easier ways to make giant organes
<Rocket> whats in these green boxes ?
<Rocket> barells *
<Alchemist> Jageman: yes, but they might not be as fine tuned or compatible.
<shizumobile> Stroyent
<shizumobile> Which is the green teleport of dead mobs
<killerpony7733> Alchemist Seems like so. Cause they can grow things like that extremely huge heart. Even a huge brain for that matter. I think they use key human components to make what they want. Like they need the upper torso and the legs just after the knees and head for most things?
<Rocket> :O they can teleporting ?
<thelonepony> when they're dead
<thelonepony> :3
<Rocket> that have no sense xD
<Dark_Horst> so what do they need this stroyent stuff for?
<Vordox> AHAHHAHAHAHHAHAAH
<Vordox> HAHAHHAAHHAHAHAha
<Vordox> hahhahahaha
<Jageman> Alchemist: they could make an extracellular matrix and flush stem cells through it, that is how researchers are converting dead organs into live ones
<Vordox> Best...NEWS EVER
<Dark_Horst> and why do they teleport corpses away?
<Vordox> http://www.screwattack.com/news/some-pc-copies-black-ops-2-disc-2-are-fact-mass-effect-2
<Vordox> THAT.
<Vordox> IS
<Vordox> Hiiiilaaarioooous!
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Oh lawd
<Jageman> Alchemist: they just need a scaffold for the cells to attach to
<Dark_Horst> haha... lol
<Rocket> :)
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> You thought this was Black Ops? Nope.avi
<thelonepony> Vordox: XD
<Alchemist> Jageman: like growing skin cells on a charged glass surface?
<killerpony7733> Alchemist It's kinda like they take things that they know cybernetics can improve and replace it with that. Then add the strogg chip in the brains of those they stroggify and all. Plus their dermal plates which is nailed to their chests so in essence they only improve the base design of a human
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Vordox> EA + Activision
<Vordox> In ONE disc
<Jageman> Alchemist: ya but in a 3d shape, using chemicals that desolve in time
<Rocket> oh god, i finally readed that :)
<Vordox> THAT...is a MASTERPIECE of a one in a million thing
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Friendship is Magic Dominates Ratings
<Jageman> Alchemist: they could boost growth by using something that desolves into simple organic chemicals that the cells can matabolize for energy
<Alchemist> killerpony7733: if they want mechanic/kinetic stability they might just be better off using full blown robots without bioparts. Dont know why would they keep the human parts. Maybe the brain, and some other organs that supports the brain.
<MadSurge> Oh man, it would suck to be hit by those things in the conveyor belt
<shana> conveyor belts: the game
<shana> feels like half life :)
<Invi> hay MadSurge ^^
<MadSurge> Hey Invi :)
<Alchemist> Jageman: Cheeseburger in hidrochloric acid?
<Rocket> guys it's just doom, there is no needed to discuting xD
<thelonepony> :I
<Michael> howdy everypony ;)
<thelonepony> Hi Michael :3
<Jageman> Alchemist: wat? where did that come from
<pony_numbers> lol who uses disks now
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hi guys
<MadSurge> Hey Michael!
<thelonepony> Hi SpadeMagnes[School] :3
<MadSurge> And hi SpadeMagnes[School]!

<pony_6913> prey?
<thelonepony> ohai MadSurge :3
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Michael and SpadeMagnes[School] :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The more and more I look at it, White Kyurem looks poorly animated than Black Kyurem
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> This is the superior breed of FPS that thrived before Halo and CoD casualized it to death
<Michael> ohai SpadeMagnes[School]
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, SpadeMagnes[School] and Michael! :)
<Rocket> wow such a big .. pink
<MadSurge> thelonepony: :)
<killerpony7733> Alchemist I do not know. But i think they see a good use for a human body. Maybe cause it's really flexible in it's design? i mean look at kane all the stroggification did to him made him 10x times stronger faster tougher then his peers
<DinkyDoo> White Kyrume?
*thelonepony hugs Michael back :3
<shizumobile> Ready?
*Michael hugs MLP_Brovakiin AJIsAwesome
<Alchemist> Jageman: well, we have HCl in our stomach and it can do basic degradation of organic materials, but we would still need some enzymes.
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: SAUSAGES!
*AJIsAwesome hugs Michael back :)
<Jageman> Alchemist: i was referring to a biopolymer plastic that decays into simple sugers
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs Michael back :)
<Michael> always ready
<Invi> don't shoot it. you make it poo
<pony_numbers> :S
*thelonepony noms on MLP_Brovakiin :3
<Jageman> Alchemist: the acid would digest the cells too
*MLP_Brovakiin noms on thelonepony :3
<Dark_Horst> more sausages!
<Alchemist> Jageman: dilute acid then :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> DinkyDoo: http://www.gigapunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/White-Kyurem.jpg This thing
<Michael> wow
<Jageman> Alchemist: then it would be uneffective
<DinkyDoo> I know who White Kyrume is..
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Conveyor belts and organs, the game
<RawketLawnchair> That'a hudge bitch.
<weeping_pegasi82> uhhhh...
<thelonepony> :O
<Cypresswolf> Strogg sausages - delicious!
<Alchemist> Jageman: I want some acid in the equation goddamit!
<thelonepony> Kill it with fire!!!!
<Dark_Horst> man, gabe newell really did let himself go
<Cypresswolf> Cobra!
<DinkyDoo> Fire-dragon type Pokemon, fused with Kyrume, weaknesses are Fire, Dragon, Ground, Rock...
<weeping_pegasi82> it really hates that box
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> BOOOX
<Jageman> Alchemist: if you make the scaffold extra sensitive to acids, a very mild one would work
<MadSurge> FATTY
<Rocket> How do you guys doing this weird litters ? :C i want to know
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: i knew someone would make that joke :S
<alexxm> so wait you work for COBRA?
<Michael> loll
<Invi> what is that thing?
<twilight_sprinkle> poor Gabe
<SpadeMagnes[School]> MOAR GRAVU
<Jageman> Alchemist: but it would be suboptimal
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *GRAVY
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: inevitable B)
<pony_numbers> play blood
*thelonepony noms on Sprunkls :3
<Jageman> Alchemist: besides, nanotech is better than biotech
<Michael> dat fat giant thing
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai tehlonpon :3

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> alexxm Cobra?! YO JOE! :D

<Jmo> That's....a....shame.....
<SpikeIs7thElement> ohhhh twi never lets play this game
<killerpony7733> Sonny Ah i see. :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> After watching Wreck It Ralph, I have to wonder how much money Disney had to shell out to Nintendo and Sega to use their characters
<Cucumber> I'm playing deadspace right now. it's too scary :O why where is no kind ponies? :'(
<Sonny> I've been doing request the past month and I'm kinda feeling isolated to what I can draw ._. killerpony7733
<alexxm> so do the normal zombie rules of getting bitten apply in this game
<AfricanSpy> oh man
<shizumobile> Screw it, health pls
<Jageman> SpadeMagnes[School]: you mean they copyrights are still good?
<killerpony7733> Sonny Yeah i getcha :P
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Ded the sequel
<Michael> damn, i <3 shotguns :)
<MadSurge> D:
<Jageman> SpadeMagnes[School]: i though they did that movie because the copyrights ran out
<AfricanSpy> fricken zambies
<killerpony7733> Sonny But it's always admirable when someone takes on that many requests
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Piss off Lanier
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Jesus
*thelonepony bites on AfricanSpy
<Cucumber> cheating detected
<Sonny> killerpony7733: I will probably (in a week or so, be in need of someponies who want to letm me draw stuff c: )
<pony_numbers> i played dead space with pokerface, maybe i didn't afraid whose types games
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I would assume so.... because Sonic is in it, and I will be damned sure they got Smith to do sonic in the movie
<pony_numbers> and screamers
<Sonny> killerpony7733: just trying to learn ^^ might as well draw what people want/desire c:
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Dead Space is literally jump scares the video game
<MadSurge> pony_numbers: Dead Space ain't scary :D
<killerpony7733> Sonny Could i by any chance take a spot when you do?
<pony_numbers> i do fun with necromorph
<AfricanSpy> hmm good thing i have dead ringer
<Sonny> killerpony7733: maaaabbbyyyy :3
<pony_numbers> yeup
<killerpony7733> Sonny Well that would be nice if you could give me a spot when you can ^^
<Michael> plasma gun?
<Sonny> killerpony7733: Do you have a deviantart page? If so, then It would be best to send me a note or I'll forgot 6_9
<Sonny> I'll forget*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I also noticed Sonic actually shows up in the movie but Mario only gets a name mention
<killerpony7733> Sonny Yes i do :)
<Cucumber> Why where are no ponies in the Slender? They might be helpful
<Sonny> killerpony7733: That way I can see who wants me to make him/her a drawing :p
<Jageman> SpadeMagnes[School]: maybe it was too much to have him in the movie
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well they got Bowser,Robotnik,M.Bison,Kano
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sonic...Qbert...
<pony_numbers> slender annoyed me
<Jageman> SpadeMagnes[School]: but mario and the face of nintendo
<Yahooz> ...
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> And that Rhino dude from Altered Beast
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Was surprised to see him
<Jageman> SpadeMagnes[School]: like mickey is the face of disney
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also should I feel like a nerd for getting almost all the video game references in the movie?
<Jageman> SpadeMagnes[School]: no, you were just part of the targeted audience
<Cucumber> Show them NO friendship! :|
<MadSurge> BRUSHYOURTEETH: that's surprisingly obscure
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Yes it is
<Invi> nighty everypony ^^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I had no idea who the guy with the horns was from
<Streetlight> well night guys

<Jageman> Eddmario: ?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What is more annoying? Bosses who heal? or bosses who summon mooks?
<Eddmario> Jageman: Woops, that was aimed at SpadeMagnes
<Jageman> Eddmario: I don't have minions
<pony_numbers> here! Take a medkit!
<Jageman> Eddmario: yet
<Eddmario> SpadeMagnes[School]: Bosses who do both?

<twilight_sprinkle> ooh, world domination plan? i have a fewtoo, i even have an idea for a doomsday weapon
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: so i guess ill just be the good guy and stop you
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So why does your guy look like some sort of freaky science program?
<DoctoDoctorWho> They said that when you dream you've got to dream big, so I drempt fucking BIG.
<shizumobile> Cause he kinda is
<twilight_sprinkle> theres actually a fun game calledevil genius
<RawketLawnchair> Woosh!
<shizumobile> Think I will stop here
<twilight_sprinkle> *evil genius
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> I remember Evil Genius
<alexxm> whats it about twilight_sprinkle
<DoctoDoctorWho> twilight_sprinkle: whats it like? I already have several under development.
<twilight_sprinkle> i wish they would make a sequel to evil genius, it was awesome
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks for the stream, Shizu. :)
<pony_numbers> i love the plot of q4
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: Wait, are you an evil genus, or a mad scientist
<weeping_pegasi82> want world domination? cure cancer
<thelonepony> Thanks For the stream Shizuka :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> twilight_sprinkle: doomsday weapons, I mean
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: you have an evil base and you build it how you want, doing objectives and sending minions into other countries
<Michael> thanks Shizu for the stream :)
<Stormy> that's gonna be expensive
<Stormy> Just to watch episodes?
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: A bit pre-emptive there :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> And you have to deal with all those annoying agents that try to invade your shit
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its going to be awesome.
<twilight_sprinkle> DoctoDoctorWho: a radiation weapon,using magnetic fields to direct the radiation
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: I know, but she said she'd stop it here.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: I like to go by "Evil Overlord"
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: Oh, ok my bad :P
<alexxm> so do you have to become strog or is it optional?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dont think its going to be too bad.
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: it was a fun game, the style was silly
<DjOctavia> So much for dazzling
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: im a bit of a mad scientist myself
<Shizuka> 13hope ponies enjoyed :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> BRUSHYOURTEETH: thats all right, just make the air ducts smaller
<MLP_Brovakiin> Yeah, thank you for the stream Shizuka :)
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: Its so hard to get funding for world domination though.
<thelonepony> we Didi :3
<alexxm> thanks for the stream Shizuka
<Michael> Shizuka: sure :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> thanks Shizuka
<thelonepony> did*
<pony_numbers> nice stream
<weeping_pegasi82> thanks for stream shizuka
<Stormy> Just you or do you know anyone IRL who likes ponies?
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Good stream.
<pony_numbers> i love it
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: already covered by steps 1-3
<twilight_sprinkle> DoctoDoctorWho: altho its a bit too cruel of a weapon
<Michael> nobody remembers Spore?
<Cypresswolf> Thanks Shizu :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Spore got boring...fast
<Shizuka> 13spore was awful
<Michael> and the entire galaxy domination
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: those steps are faulty,
<pony_numbers> agreed
<Michael> yeah,
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: or else someone would have taken over by now
<DoctoDoctorWho> twilight_sprinkle: I already have a death ray design that would actually work
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Not to mention you activate hard mode when you reach the center of the galaxy
<Michael> but it was pretty interesting
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> LOL
*Spyrorocks[Laptop] forever alone
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fucking Grox
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> just kidding
<twilight_sprinkle> DoctoDoctorWho: whats the design?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its a meetup.
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: what is your energy source?
<Stormy> haha
<Stormy> cool
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> haha I can imagine myself
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sitting in there alone
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: unless you have a good energy source your design is worthless
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Stormy> well that's what I thought it was XD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You are fucked if you ally with or try to destroy the Grox either way
<Stormy> I was like... that's a little excessive...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I have a projector i could set up at home if i wanted that
<Vordox> Thnks for streaming, Shizuka =3
<Vordox> Must've lagged. O.o
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If you ally with the grox every empire in the fucking galaxy hates you and wants you dead
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but with more people… need a larger place
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> depending on how many people show up I want to do text message voting on next episode
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> would be cool.
<DoctoDoctorWho> twilight_sprinkle: Its basicly a pulse weapon that, upon making contact with the nervous system, tells everything to just stop. Effectively killing the target.
<Jageman> the ironman suit is possible except for the energy source and repulsors
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: and energy pulse?
<twilight_sprinkle> DoctoDoctorWho: a pulse of what though?
<Jageman> ya
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: if it is an electrical pulse, we have those already
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: working on the same or similar frequancy that the nervous system works on.
<Meanwhile> Hi everyone.
<Yahooz|Physics> hey Meanwhile
<Jmo> Naaaaaaaaa
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Meanwhile.
<Michael> hai Meanwhile
<thelonepony> Hi Meanwhile
<DoctoDoctorWho> Meanwhile, with Meanwhile
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: that just sounds like a taser
<SpadeMagnes[School]> meanwhile at the hall of justice
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: a really really mean taser, but similar yes.
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: what is the medium that the pulse travels through, air?
<Meanwhile> The medium is your face.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: as I said, design. not working prototype.
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: so, its just a lightning cannon?
<Meanwhile> I have no idea what the topic is, but it's probably your face.
<Rocket> xD
<twilight_sprinkle> Jageman: well a lightning is ions
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> You guys overcomplicate it, all you needs a cult. One with plenty of propaganda brainwashing
<SpadeMagnes[School]> There's something your face!
<twilight_sprinkle> Jageman: an em pulse doesnt have to be made of ions i think
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: there are many working prototypes that do that already
<pony_numbers> who played in 'I have no mouth but i must scream'?
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeMagnes[School]: *punch* It was PAIN!
<Rocket> maybe electromagnetic pulse?
<pony_numbers> just awesome
<Jageman> twilight_sprinkle: an em pulse is useless for killing
<Jageman> twilight_sprinkle: except at levels that are currently unreachabel
<Michael> mmmmh science talk :$
<Jageman> unreachable*
<twilight_sprinkle> Jageman: but his idea is to have it interfere with the body em fields, i think, although i dont know much about biology
<Meanwhile> Doesn't it just make you want to stick your face over a bunsen burner.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Anything at a high enough frequancy could kill us
<Jageman> twilight_sprinkle: your cellphone messes with your em field. your body is uneffected
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: wrong
<twilight_sprinkle> Jageman: yeah but its a weak em, and it actually can affect your body
<DoctoDoctorWho> Hell, a 22.5 richter earthquake on a planet 10 lightyears away would kill you
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: its not the frequency that kills but the power behind it
*Nittany_Discord 11,01washes Bronysith and puts him in Rainbow Dash cosplay
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: With maid costume or without?
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: also, you can direct lightning with a laser
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: thats what I ment, power/frequancy/wave
<Rocket> yeah i thought about laser too :D
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: those are not the same
<twilight_sprinkle> DoctoDoctorWho: yeah i think its the amplitude of the wave that does the damage
<Rocket> Np. for plasma, maybe there is way to direct plasma by charged fotons
<Jageman> twilight_sprinkle: no
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: whichever term fits the context I am using is the one I mean
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rocket: Photons?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Vordox: Your choice.
<twilight_sprinkle> Jageman: why not, bigger amplitude means bigger force of interaction
<Rocket> DoctoDoctorWho: yes :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Jageman: o wait nvm
<twilight_sprinkle> Jageman: i forgot energy of a wave is frequency related
<DoctoDoctorWho> So frequency was right from the beginning!
<twilight_sprinkle> DoctoDoctorWho: yeah but it doesnt have to be at the same frequency of the body
<Jageman> lasers are not very effective in an atmosphere because they lose too much energy into the air
<DoctoDoctorWho> What say you about an orbital-mounted railgun
<Jageman> but that is the reason lasers can redirect lightning
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Being sick sucks...
<Jageman> the laser creates a channel of ionized air that is electicaly conductive
<DoctoDoctorWho> SpadeMagnes[School]: BY THE POWER OF CHRIST BE HEALED!!!
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: the government already has dibs on that
<twilight_sprinkle> Jageman: owaw ive never heard of that, interesting
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Being disabled really sucks.
<Michael> SpadeMagnes[School]: IKR? :(
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jageman: not in space...
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: yes
<Rocket> Jageman: then i m a genius, cause i thought one week about that too :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> There is a treaty that specificly states no weapons in space
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: they are called the rods of god and they were designed in the 80s i think
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: wrong
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: ther is a treaty banning nuclear weapons in space
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: you are?
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: kinetic weapons are the loophole
<Rocket> DoctoDoctorWho: Secret laser canon on orbit osn't wearpon :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I won't say positively.
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: your looking it up now, huh.
<pony_numbers> sanity is for the weak!
<DoctoDoctorWho> Rods of god is simply an automated sattelite chucking I beams at the target. they cannot be aimed and the progect was never fully implemented
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: there have been better designs made since then
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: i dont qite understand what you mean by positively,vut whatever the case,you are a scientist! and you know your stuff, and thats a rare thing, especially nowadays
<DoctoDoctorWho> A railgun in space however, is much more dangerous
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: that was just the oldest one i could think ove
<Rocket> But anyway, is that possible to conduct plasma with laser ? or accelerated metal pices ?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm unemployed. I just have a fancy degree.
<Stormy> damn it rails
<Jageman> Rocket: not really
<Stormy> why don't you know what int is
<pony_5209> hi
<Michael> hai pony_5209
<Jageman> Rocket: but you could use a laser to make plasma
<pony_numbers> hi /)
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: give it time and you will. there are always places that could use a could scientist, just need to do some digging
<pony_5209> mlp is teh best evar
<twilight_sprinkle> *will have a job
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not 100% that I'll even get to have a science or teaching career.
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: *could use a good scientist
<Jageman> Rocket: I think that is what they are using to kickstart a fusion reactor
<Rocket> Jageman: I wish to see in my life working orbital ion cannon just like in command & conquer 3
<Rainbow> hello
<Michael> hai Rainbow
<Jageman> Rocket: keep dreaming
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: well its never 100% just because life, but you have a very good chance, since you know your stuffs
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Huge cry about teacher wanted
<Jageman> Rocket: ions are a pain to use as a weapon
<Vordox> Teachers doesn't get job
<Vordox> Moment 22
<Rocket> Jageman: yeah, but these reactors are creating energy same to intaked
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know my stuff, but I have very little experience.
<pony_numbers> working orbital ion cannon not effectively i think
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: That remidns me ...
<Jageman> Rocket: same to what?
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: well i personally think theory is more important. you can derive anything you want from the core theory

<Rainbow> .
<Rainbow> ..
<Rainbow> .
<DoctoDoctorWho> A railgun fires hyper dense slugs at the target with a STARTING speed of mach 8. It is a barreled weapon that will be capable of surgical precision strikes on a target obliterating almost any defence from above with unforgiving force

<BlazeAngel> Hello there bronystate. I did not see you there. When I wake up, I like to eat some Wertheres breakfast sausage...
<Jageman> using a high powered laser to redirect lightning as a weapon would be awesome but impractical

<pony_numbers> jelly
<haseo348> word still banned?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and not make it messy
<Vordox> Anyone? =<
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you get decent code.
<DoctoDoctorWho> the armor is coated in an experimental plastic compound that is immune to all heat based weapons, it has EMP and radiation countermeasures under the conventional armor
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Vordox: i wish i did :D really wanna play this song on a harmonica http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-r9g_-5huM
<DinkyDoo> Hi everypony!
<Vordox> Hai Dink
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DinkyDoo. :)
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: theoritical?
<Michael> hai DinkyDoo
<thelonepony> Hi DinkyDoo :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> I belive its copper plating that stops EMPs?
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: btw, nothing is immune to heat
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai again DinkyDoo :)
<haseo348> o lookie who here dinkydoo
<DinkyDoo> Hello everypony that said hi to me c:
<MLP_Brovakiin> Jageman: The sun?
<alexxm> how are things DinkyDoo
<haseo348> hello!
<Bronysith> delicious bags
<Jageman> DoctoDoctorWho: only if it has no holes in the plating
<DinkyDoo> Alexxm: Good, I guess.
<sub06905> gàk
<Stormy> yeah
<sub06905> :>
<DinkyDoo> Hi Jageman!
<thelonepony> oh u :3
<Jageman> DinkyDoo: hi
<haseo348> guk?
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: :I
<Jageman> MLP_Brovakiin: no not even the sun
<MLP_Brovakiin> :I
<Jageman> MLP_Brovakiin: if the sun was superheated, it woudl super nova
<Stormy> my teacher that's making us use rails basically said php gives you too much freedom to screw up
<MLP_Brovakiin> good :3
<pony_numbers> thelonepony do :S face it's adorable
<sub06905> AJIsAwesome, dat me
<Stormy> So it all makes sense why he likes rails...
<Meanwhile> The sun'll supernova on it's own eventually anyways. Speed it up if you can.
<thelonepony> pony_numbers: No :3
<DinkyDoo> I'm gonna scare myself by listening to Sweetie Derell going ''AAAAAAA'' again xD.
<Jageman> Meanwhile: wrong
<Jageman> Meanwhile: it does not have enough fuel
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> c/++ will let you screw up too.
<Jageman> Meanwhile: it is not massive enough
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> asm will let you screw up
<Meanwhile> Not like my dick.
<alexxm> DinkyDoo don't do it you'll go insane
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> computers only do what they are told.
<Stormy> and java
<Stormy> He wouldn't shut up about Java
<DinkyDoo> Alexxm: I will...?
<haseo348> lolololol
<Stormy> until he found out about rails
<Jageman> Meanwhile: stars that supernova are huge and relatively short lasting
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<DinkyDoo> ...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Those who can't do, teach.
*DinkyDoo QUICKLY REMOVES HISTORY
<Stormy> he was in the industry for like 10 years
<Jageman> Meanwhile: burning off in less than a billion years or so
<Stormy> that's what I don't get
*DinkyDoo Removes history in five seconds
<Meanwhile> I am literally enthralled by this refresher course in relatively local astral phenomena.
<Stormy> I think he switched to teaching so his son could get free tuition
<DinkyDoo> Sweetie Derelle haunts me..
<Michael> Gnight everypony :)
<DinkyDoo> I still hear her going '''AAAAAAAAA''
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> companies don't hire older programmers either.
<haseo348> can some one explain how far ahead or how far behind est time is for a californien pony?
<Jageman> why does everyone i talk tech to leave me? :(
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> if hes older thats another reason.
<Stormy> I have no idea how he even got hired; he's extremely weird
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Michael. :)
<thelonepony> Night Michael :)
<Stormy> He's like 50 I think, so maybe
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you gotta be a little bit of a nut to program well.
<Jageman> Michael: bye
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Michael :)
<Stormy> haha
<Stormy> true
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its no fun otherwise.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> :P
<Bronysith> haseo348: 84342 million years
<haseo348> :O
<haseo348> -.-
<Stormy> maybe that's my problem with rails, I'm just not weird enough
<alexxm> bye Michael
<Jageman> haseo348: is it 4 hours ?
<DinkyDoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ0epRjfGLw

<Jageman> haseo348: im in az so it changes for me
<MLP_Brovakiin> COngrats! :3
<Derpy101> Hello everypony!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Derpy101 :)
<thelonepony> Hi Derpy101 L)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> hmm
<thelonepony> :)*
<haseo348> jageman: not sure...thats why im asking everypony here..
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Derpy101. :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> try dying your hair a bunch of colours
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sometimes that helps.
<haseo348> jageman: i dont wanna be late for movie night..
<Derpy101> :)
<haseo348> or new episodes for that mater..
<Jageman> haseo348: is the timer set for est?
<BladedWings> haseo348: i think est is three hours ahead of pst ^_^
<Jageman> haseo348: and does that matter?
<Stormy> lol
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> heres some Game Grumps Sonic '06 to keep ya busy :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdeLpndCux8
<Jageman> haseo348: when i joined for the premier it counted down just fine for me
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sketch_Toku_Brony, aw shit
<haseo348> BladedWings: i hope so...
<Jageman> haseo348: and im in az
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sketch_Toku_Brony, IT'S NO USE
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Eh I like the Brainscratch version of 06 more...more for the fact of Sonic getting sent to the moon
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix: :D ikr
<AJIsAwesome> IT'S NO USE!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And table rape
<haseo348> jageman: i see the timer for friday movie night
<Stormy> rainbow dash hair
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> LETS SPEED UP
<Stormy> perfect
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: I like both. Especially because of that. And TO THE MOON!!!!
<haseo348> jageman: but i get home like at 4:40...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> rainbow dash hair is so overdone.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> :P
<Jageman> haseo348: the timer worked for me last time
<Stormy> people would probably just assume i'm a lesbian or something
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I really dont know why but the animated sprite for White Kyurem looks less animated than Black Kyurem
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I think people assume im gay when i wear my rainbow dash hat.
<Jageman> haseo348: i think the timer is works no matter what time zone you are in
<haseo348> jageman: wait are we talking about the same timer here?
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> *the Silver fight*
<Stormy> hahaha
<Jageman> haseo348: it happens every week
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Fuck that fucking useless character, of all the terrible things Sonic '06' did, he was...one of them.
<Stormy> I heard people at work talking about bronies today
<haseo348> jageman: because i have no idea what your talking about...we are talking about the movie night timer right?...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You want to know something funny?
<CrimsonPhoenix> You know
<Jageman> haseo348: ya
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You know how silver is so slow?
<Stormy> Manager says to my coworker "Have you ever heard of bronies?"
<CrimsonPhoenix> I feel bad for Blaze in 06
<AJIsAwesome> Wasn't he supposed to have an upgrade to make him faster?
<Stormy> "No, what's that?"
<SpadeMagnes[School]> A dummied out power up was supposed to speed him up
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I think a lot of programmers are.
<Stormy> "It's people who watch my little pony"
<CrimsonPhoenix> since 06 just wrecked everything that was built with Blaze in Sonic Rush
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Pfffthaha
<scout19_tf2> still no stream:S
<haseo348> jageman: oh i think i get you...
<Stormy> "haha, like a club or something?"
<AJIsAwesome> But they forgot to put it in the game. :S
<Jageman> haseo348: the time between now and the movie night is not relative to your local time
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Blaze played well in 06
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Yeah Blaze got a raw deal
<haseo348> jageman: ohh ok i got it.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You know what else they forgot to program into 06?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sonic's gem meter being able to drain
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[School], I know thats why I feel bad for her
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Especially since she shows up with goddamn Silver a lot
<Jageman> SpadeMagnes[School]: a good game?
<Frosted> Hello Everypony!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Frosted. :)
<Derpy101> Hi Frosted!
<Stormy> And I'm just standing there like "You _just_ found out about bronies??"
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It even says in the fucking MANUAL that sonic's meter will drain
<Frosted> :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[School], since it's implying that she comes from the future and not another dimension
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They dont even fucking proof read the manuals
*Spyrorocks[Laptop] rips off shirt to reveal giant MLP tattoo on back
<thelonepony> Hi Frosted :)
<Jageman> SpadeMagnes[School]: they forgot to program a good game?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> that would be so funny.
<Stormy> hahaha
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I have to be honest with you guys
<CrimsonPhoenix> as much cliche as Blaze was
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love her
<Swaffy> ?
<Stormy> In my case I would probably get fired... :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Blaze is one of the few good sonic characters
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> The defining moment of Sonic '06 is when you can just walk past the loops. Literally walk the loops.
<Stormy> Hey Swaffy
<Swaffy> Hello humans.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God I hate 06 Omega
<Jageman> http://www.dorkly.com/video/5464/sonic-takes-a-stroll
<haseo348> jageman: so it would start at 4:00 pm for me then...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy or promoted.
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Who is this Omega you speak of?
<Frosted> Nothing is streaming? Aww.
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> There is only Gamma.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> E-123 Omega
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> NOPE
<Jageman> haseo348: it starts in 3days and 22minutes for everyone
<AJIsAwesome> You do know Gamma is dead, right?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> His hover is so broken you can glitch to parts of wave ocean he isnt supposed to get into
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> I can't hear youuuu
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, wasn't he brought back in Battle?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> also Stormy did i show you this http://i.imgur.com/T13Iy.jpg
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> made me lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MWEHwvcnyM very relevent
<Derpy101> *Gives Everypony a muffin*
<Stormy> oh yeah I've see that, haha
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Theres this one line in shadow's story that is so bad
<Swaffy> XD
<Frosted> *Eats muffin* Thanks Derpy101 :)
<Jageman> CrimsonPhoenix: mine is funnier
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Yes I know that Omega is a different character, the point is that he's so awful compared to Gamma it crosses over into hilarity
<SpadeMagnes[School]> A gun agent tells Shadow to proceed to wave ocean and then the line repeats...again
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sup Swaffy
<Swaffy> Hello, sir.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Jageman, but it doesn't include a lot of glitches
<CrimsonPhoenix> only one
<Swaffy> *tipsNonExistentHat*
<Jageman> CrimsonPhoenix: but it shows the dumbest one
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Anyone remember when Shadow used to be fast?
<AJIsAwesome> I do.
<Jageman> CrimsonPhoenix: besides dorkly is funny
<CrimsonPhoenix> Jageman, I know but there are still alot of others glitches to know
<AJIsAwesome> Not all Dorkly is funny, IMO.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And Sonic Man is a joke if SILVER,FUCKING SILVER can out run him
<Jageman> AJIsAwesome: i know, but most is funny
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D oh god Game Grumps fighting Silver rofl
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: I know, right? :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Shadow's story was the only competent one of the bunch
<Arcane> And I'm back o:
<thelonepony> wb Arcane :)
<alexxm> how've you been Arcane
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> The Silver fight is arguably one of the worst things in video games.
<FluffyFluttershy> hello everypony! what are we talking about?
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Someone programmed it and thought it was a good idea.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Ive been enjoying this documentary http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UneYciGf84I&feature=related
<Arcane> ty thelonepony How is everypony?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God help you if you get stuck between him and a wall
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You keep picking up a ring and cant die
*thelonepony noms on Arcane :3
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, FluffyFluttershy and welcome back, Arcane. :)
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> IT'S NO USE!
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> *wall slam*
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> IT'S NO USE!
<Arcane> thelonepony Not the mane, D:
<thelonepony> :3
<Derpy101> Hello FluffyFluttershy
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also Silver is a beginners trap
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You would assume you can just homing attack him and be done with it
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Legend of Greg :D
<Frosted> Hi FluffyFluttershy;)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heay FluffyFluttershy :)
<alexxm> how are things FluffyFluttershy
<FluffyFluttershy> :)
<FluffyFluttershy> Good
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[School], it's not really hard to figure it out really
<thelonepony> Hi FluffyFluttershy :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I find it hilarious Silver is harder than the Sonic fight..Sonic fight is a joke
<FluffyFluttershy> Hi everypony ^-^
<Swaffy> Gambling?
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Hello FluffyFluttershy
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SpadeMagnes[School]: ikr :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yeah
<FluffyFluttershy> So were talking about Sonic?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Also Shadow/Sonic fight in Sonic Adventure 2 you had to homing attack at the back
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> those people are nutcases.
<Swaffy> I don't ever want to gamble.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrMk-JW_IUQ
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> We're talking about a terrible Sonic character and how awful it is to fight him.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Behold!
<Arcane> http://giftkrieg23.deviantart.com/art/The-Savage-World-of-My-Little-Pony-3rd-Edition-310099228 <--win
<FluffyFluttershy> Oh Okay then
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Im a logical thinker
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> at least I like to think I am.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and gambling doesn't make sense.
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[School]: Until you learn what to do, then you just wait for him to go "How bout this?" then run him and slide kick him
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> now theyre ranting on about Silver's chest and how he chews on it like someone does w/ a pen or hair at Driver's ED all like "...huh wha?" :D
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[School]: Then he's easy
<Swaffy> Heheh
<alexxm> night guys
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The fact sonic gets absolutly destroyed with a barrage of tables is hilarious
<MLP_Brovakiin> Night alexxm :)
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> It's funny when you're desperately spamming Homing ATtack to try and get away from him, and you keep running into his ass until he gets up. GAMEPLAY
<Stormy> I just changed something in a view and didn't get any errors!
<AJIsAwesome> Night, alexxm. :)
<Stormy> :D
<Stormy> amazing
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I hated the voice for Omega in 06
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Iphone6s> Hi
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I got some new headphones today
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> they seem to be good.
<Imagination> No stream again..
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I have a crease on my hair
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> where the band goes around
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Stormy> lol, do you ever take them off?
<thelonepony> you got to wait :I
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<Iphone6s> Im the new iPhone6s , now 20 inches bigger than past generations.
<AJIsAwesome> Mods will stream when they want to. Please be patient. :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> no
<Meanwhile> Streams don't exist, streams're a myth.
<Swaffy> lol
<Imagination> Iphone6s: mobile techologies suck
<thelonepony> and cuz, mods do have lives you know
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> they are noise cancelling
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and theres a lot of noise around.
<Meanwhile> Like Bigfoot. Or free wi-fi.
<Stormy> I just use those little earbuds and have to keep putting them in when I run
<Swaffy> Tutle Beach?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so I wouldnt want to take them off
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[School]: Yeah 4Kids had a good voice for Omega in Shadow then they give him the crappy robot voice in 06
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> then I would have to listen to customers.
<Swaffy> *Turtle
<thelonepony> lawl
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek iphone 5 o3o
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sennheiser 380pros
<Jageman> Meanwhile: or a president that everyone wants?
<Yahooz|Physics> yessir
<Meanwhile> Jageman: I'm English, screw your politics.
<Yahooz|Physics> President Poopert
<Swaffy> Cool.
*thelonepony noms on SuperBrony64 :3
<Yahooz|Physics> reporting for duty
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also 06 is one massive logic failure
<SuperBrony64> 11,02President Derpy
<Jageman> Meanwhile: same problems different system
<Kurra> Meanwhile, screw your screw. And your bolt too! :p
*SuperBrony64 noms on thelonepony nack :3
<Kurra> hee.
<haseo348> lol i just read the faq and if we demand ponies on stream we get newborn cuties....
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/9KQ--EWFWgU this is pretty cool
<Kurra> hi all!
<Meanwhile> In fact screw my politics too.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> If all Mephilis had to do was to make Elise cry to fuse with Iblis why didnt he just do it himself?
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy 2016. She promised us muffins.
<thelonepony> SuperBrony64: President Wiiu :3
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[School]: That's what you get when you rush your game to get in stores and don't finish it and don't play test it right
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can understand SimGretina a bit
<Swaffy> I only have Sony stuio headphones, cna't run in those.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I used to think wearing big headphones was stupid
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but I dont care anymore.
<Meanwhile> Screw politics in general. If I wanted to be depressed about the state of the world I'd read a year 9 science paper.
<CrimsonPhoenix> at first I was like heeeeeeeh generic
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I like these ones because apparently they are supposed to be reference headphones
<Kurra> what game J_E_Smith71 ?
<Jageman> All hail president Celestia
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Screw celestia
<J_E_Smith71> Kura: Sonic '06
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and not shitty headphones that mutiliate and rape your audio like beats or something.
<Jageman> see?
<Kurra> oh really?
<Swaffy> These ones.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but now I kinda think of him has the dance genre artist
<haseo348> sonic '06 sucked..
<Kurra> I forget how it is.
<Imagination> It's true some days are dark and lonely...
<Swaffy> Hey RDX.
<Jageman> another myth is not landing on the moon
<Iphone6s> Shadow the hedgeogh sucked
<RedDragonX> Hello
<haseo348> sonic heros was ok...
<Stormy> yo
<CrimsonPhoenix> Seriously
<J_E_Smith71> Iphone6s: It was better than Sonic '06 though
<Jageman> because if it was fake, we would have 1uped it by now
<AJIsAwesome> Shadow The Hedgehog was meh to me.
<Swaffy> I just don't have the money to go buying fancy headphones.
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Shadow the Hedgehog was hilarious for how backwards it was. You know what a Sonic game needs? GUNZ AND MOTORBIKES
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Hey it was better that Sonic 06 at least
<haseo348> LOL
<CrimsonPhoenix> just get like every SimGretina's soundtrack and you have enough tunes to last a clube for weekse
*Kurra watches the history of early American spaceflight.
<thelonepony> never played any new Sonic games tbh
<CrimsonPhoenix> weeks**
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Agreed.
<Jageman> AJIsAwesome: I like what shadow could have been but was not
<thelonepony> I never*
<Iphone6s> Never gonna give you up
<Imagination> Play lovepotiondisaster there is no shadow
<haseo348> i didnt get sonic unleashed...it seemed boring to me...
<Stormy> My next big purchase will probably be a new, non-HP laptop
<haseo348> i played it but...i didnt feel right...
<AJIsAwesome> I liked Sonic Unleashed. The Werehog could've been better.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Swaffy I figure its something i use every day
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so might as wellput some money into it
<AJIsAwesome> They were going to have Knuckles as the Werehog, but they cancelled the idea due to time constraints.
<Swaffy> My car is my boombox. XD For non-boomy music.
<AJIsAwesome> *instead of the Werehog
<thelonepony> would of fit knuckles Persona
<AJIsAwesome> You know what would've been interesting?
<thelonepony> what?
<thelonepony> :3
<haseo348> if tails turned to a werewolf?
<Imagination> Your sonic and mario are foolish only Turok have a sense <_<
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Knuckles in beat em up gameplay would have been better. I've always thought that
<Meanwhile> If they hadn't used the term "werehog" because it doesn't make sense?
<Swaffy> Stormy, what do you want?
<AJIsAwesome> If Knuckles would've been in the game replacing the Werehog, that game could've been considered a SA3.
<haseo348> SA3 they're saving that for dreamcast 2
<haseo348> i hope...
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Well it was called Sonic World Adventure in Japan actually
<Stormy> A new laptop that won't fall apart :(
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Oh yeah, I forgot that.
<Imagination> Sonic Rainboow rules the equstria
<Swaffy> Oh. Like those bullet-proof military laptops.
<Stormy> despite the case being broken it still functions perfectly well though, so I'm not going to buy one for a while
<Kurra> Pleeeease let there be ponies in the next SSBB? c:
<haseo348> does anybody else think sega might get back into the home console bussiness again>
<Stormy> Not necessarily
<haseo348> ???
<thelonepony> SSBB?
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> I'd want Sega to get back into that race again.
<Swaffy> How did it break?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>saw a capitalised Persona
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> I was on Team Sega back then.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>thought discussing of Persona 4 Arena
<thelonepony> :D
<Stormy> It's a defect with the model I got
<SaxyPretender> 0,14sadly this is not the case ;_;
<Kurra> It's gonna be sad when youth don't know the awesome of super smash brothers brawl. :<
<haseo348> i do also but someone currently in the race would have to drop out...
<Imagination> sega, nintendo, xbox... only pc have a sense
<Meanwhile> Saxy is disappoint.
<Stormy> The left hinge always breaks
<thelonepony> sorry SaxyPretender :D
<thelonepony> now Bustah wolf >:3
<Stormy> plus I carry it around with me all the time... so it probably got a little beat up from that too
<Iphone6s> I have a sega saturn
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Simple enough, Sony's on the verge on dropping out anyway due to horrible decisions
*Kurra recoils, goes brush his teeth D:
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> XD
<haseo348> ok mods im going to ask this. can we have a vote real quick?
<AJIsAwesome> I liked Brawl, but I prefer Melee.
<Kurra> Okay okay, I'm going!
<pony_numbers> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZVwJfkM0Eg
<Stormy> I should take a picture
<Swaffy> Duct tape. Magenta tiger stripe duct tape.http://www.hooptapecanada.com/bmz_cache/f/f5308cdd2d635f051f94fd2d4f873001.image.350x207.JPG
<Stormy> The left corner is held together by tape
<Imagination> Do svidan'ya don't get any on ya
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> Sega has a lot of neat properties that aren't just Sonic
*Kurra bets we have only monolingual mods. :/
<BRUSHYOURTEETH> But they tend to forget about them

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hah my plan to trap sonic has worked perfectly!

<Derpy_Hooves> We_got_the_wub_wub: that is technically a spoiler
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Not to sound like a jerk but when my uncle told my grandfather that my great aunt nancy died, I didnt feel that sad, majorly because I never knew I HAD a great aunt Nancy
<Derpy_Hooves> spoilers are insta-bans on this site
<Pinkies4thWall> Phase, is it okay if i post a theory pertaining to the name of the next ep?
*Phase4 00,02prepares the ban hammer

<Cactus> D:
<Phase4> 00,02Pinkies4thWall, probably not, you can join another channel or talk via pm with those who dont mind spoilers though

<Kurra> honestly it's really not good to shout that there's no stream, this is a mostly kicktail community built for free and offered for free by a few people who also surely have to balance life and work and coming home tired. c.c
<sub06905> no :v
<scout19_tf2> MLP_Brovakiin: well yea i gesh

<prince-dari> Nothing's too harsh for doshwothronbows
<AJIsAwesome> ....
<AJIsAwesome> What's THAT supposed to mean?
<DashWithRainbows> I have skin of steel, Dari's words mean nothing.
<Squallken> I wish I had your skin of steel when it came to the MLP game, it takes so long, but its so so much fun :)
<Squallken> i love this game
<Gold_Demona> I wish I could play it. :<
<MadSurge> I wish I could too :( my dad is the one with and Ipad
<Squallken> just one question. are you easily tempted to pay money? if so this is not the game for you
<Gold_Demona> I don't even have that MadSurge.
<Gold_Demona> No such devices in this house
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: wait for your Mac to be fixed
<Squallken> find Derpy again :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge, I still couldn't play it.
<Gold_Demona> My mac has OSX, not iOS
<Gold_Demona> iOS is devices
<Gold_Demona> of the handheld variety
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: make a comic when your Mac comes back :)
<Gold_Demona> I think I might. XD
<Gold_Demona> My PC's still lonely, and my husband's PC still thinks my PC is dumb and crazy. :P

<Squallken> im kinda hoping in the future there would be a better way to get gems
<MadSurge> I just slam everything into one folder, have only recently started to make separate folders for games and everything else
<Gold_Demona> Squallken, From what I've seen of it, it functions like a typical facebook game (which I'm surprised they haven't made it into) so probably not.
<Squallken> ah ok
<Gold_Demona> You either have to wait patiently to get them or pay money for them
<Squallken> im going to see how long I can go without paying
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Squallken> so far im okay
<Squallken> only need 10 more crystal hearts :D

<Vivix> hehe yeah
<Lil_B> and finally got some decent Guitar sounds out of it, wanted to get these sounds for quite a while xD
<Vivix> Ah, nice
<Lil_B> ... man, NintendoGermany just posted a bunch of the german WiiU TV spots... they are horrible :/
<alexxm> Lil_B how bad
<Lil_B> alexxm same as other WiiU spots, but with horrible Dubbing, no feeling, poor choice of words, and it doesn't remotly sound like these words are coming from these persons
<Lil_B> man, and people still thank that MLP got a bad Dub here xD
<Vivix> hehe
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I heard that the Twilight VA is pretty good :D
<Lil_B> MadSurge yeah, they are allk good VAs, the only thing that is bad somtimes in the german dub is the choice of words and sometimes the emphesising (like they just got the plain text, without notices like "serkastic" or something like that)
<Lil_B> other than that, lots of Fans here just complain about that they "don't sound like the Character". to which I can just say, they do sound like the Character, they just don't sound like the original VA
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: you just wait until the german dub of s2 comes out
<Saturn> 08,01apparently, there's a galacon easter egg
<Lil_B> Saturn it's already out, started last week I think
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Italian dubbers seem to have gotten the sarcasm :D I like Twilight, Applejack/Fluttershy and Pinkie can rage pretty well :D RD is meh, and Rarity is the worst of the bunch, although the VA seems to have taken ham lessons for the second season XD
<Lil_B> Saturn started with the Wedding Episodes xD
<MadSurge> ^same
<x1es> Why is it so bloody expensive to go to a good ballet? *pout*
<Lil_B> MadSurge yeah, but I basicly hate all people which arguments can be summed up as "is not like the original"
<MadSurge> Lil_B: same
<Lil_B> Discord got a nice VA here, he does a good job, but unfourtunatly, he doesn't sound "old" enough, if you know what I mean xD they should have removed Discords Beard for that xD
<MadSurge> Twilight sounds nothing like Tara's performance, but she captures pretty well the spirit :D
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: ...
<Saturn> 08,01Hasbro Europe why dost thou suck?!
<MadSurge> Lil_B: you don't diss german Data
<x1es> Ahoyhoy Saturn!
<Saturn> 08,01hullo x1es!
<Lil_B> Saturn you should have seen the first "Official European Brony Shirts" xD
<MadSurge> Hello Saturn :) how's stuff?
<Lil_B> MadSurge he does so much more, like Patty the priate from Spongebob Sqarepants xD
<MadSurge> :D
<x1es> Saturn: Query for you! Which of the songs in fim do you figure has a melody best rendered on the 'cello? =P
<Saturn> 08,01x1es: My Alcoholic Friends

<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> Huh. "He's not a registered sex offender. He pled guilty to misdemeanor obscenity, and that was it. He could have been﻿ prosecuted by two separate jurisdictions: one decided not to pursue it at all, because the evidence was so weak; the other waited until the last possible day to file charges. And they took a reduced plea. My guess: some young prosecutor punk wanted a celebrity scalp on his or her wall, and knew Paul wouldn't want a tri
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> Sorry for text wall

<Deacon> my favorite fanon trixie, yay
<Deacon> cute, yet evil
<jbh1145> pikachu x idk and piplup x idk
<Deacon> buneary?
<jbh1145> oshawott x nobody :(
<Eli> wuzzup you ponies?
<Deacon> wuzzup Eli!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Eli :)
<Eli> Deacon: boredom is up! and with you?
<alexxm> how are things Eli
<DaringDerpy> hi Eli
<Eli> alexxm: getting squished to death by schoolwork, otherwise fine. you?
<Deacon> Eli cold
<DaringDerpy> I've never read a trixie fanfic
<alexxm> i've been better Eli
<Eli> DaringDerpy: you should. most of them are fun
<DaringDerpy> twilight obsessed trixie sounds a bit nsfw...not sure if I want this
<Eli> DaringDerpy: love the Twixie. can't wait for Trixie's return in S3 :$
<DaringDerpy> :)
<Eli> DaringDerpy: what story are you considering to read? if it's on fimfiction.net i have most likely read it and could recomend it... or not
<DaringDerpy> I have no idea
<DaringDerpy> haven't read more than 10 or 20 fanfics at all
<Deacon> c'mon, you gotta admit this is cute http://www.derpibooru.org/30578
<DaringDerpy> don't really know the scene
<jbh1145> youtube poop:) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqLt1fHwbCY&feature=plcp
<Deacon> cute and...a bit sappy... :(
<Eli> DaringDerpy: if it contains romance and no humans i have probably read it at some point. i have around 500 stories on my phone...
<Moopy> ok so i was reading some stuff on PonyChat and thats alot of information in there holy crap
<DaringDerpy> oh wow
<Eli> Deacon: the story this most likely refers to is Doll. check it out
<Eli> god damn it i'm a nerd
<Deacon> oh, never knew it was based on a fic
<DaringDerpy> I finished fallout equestria yesterday...ok for a fanfic, I think. but nothing extraordinary
<DaringDerpy> Eli: anything really awesome you could suggest?
<Eli> DaringDerpy: dawn fade's university nights.
<Moopy> Well New York is still screwd up ny hurricane sandy though so i would not travel there
<Moopy> Oh crap i didn't mean to do that my mistake on that
<Eli> DaringDerpy: i love that story. Stories with background ponies usually are better written than with the mane six. because their personality aren't defined in the show, and the author has more creative space.
<DaringDerpy> adult content...
<Ryunosuke> they are still serving watered down Manhattans?
<Ryunosuke> :)
<jbh1145> HOW ABOUT THIS? http://www.fimfiction.net/story/44792/Damn-it%2C-Twilight%2C-I-love-you%21
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Animation: My Little Pony: Dota 2
<DaringDerpy> Eli: true...same here
<DaringDerpy> Eli: thx, I will read it
<Eli> many who write with the mane 6 fuck up their personality some way
<Ryunosuke> added "sunshine" to my reading list as well
<Eli> DaringDerpy: ... sorry "university days"
<pony_numbers> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jKuYOotsA
<DaringDerpy> erm...
<Ryunosuke> its not bad
<jbh1145> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95_1fPf2dhs&feature=related
<Eli> DaringDerpy: nights is just the side story for the "adult" stuff. but seriously, even that isn't clop. that's just finer romance
<Eli> DaringDerpy: i'm not really into clop myself
<Ryunosuke> there is a difference between clop and romance
<Ryunosuke> yea, I've read both
<DaringDerpy> I find it slightly disturbing...cartoon ponies
<DaringDerpy> but...who am I to judge ^^
<Eli> DaringDerpy: yeah, but just read university days. and then check out nights maybe. if you can "clop" to that you deserv an award
<Chrysalis> 'sup guys
<DaringDerpy> sounds like a challenge :P
<DaringDerpy> hi Chrysalis
<Ryunosuke> being a brony means you have an open mind :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Chrysalis :)
<Ryunosuke> or at leasat more open after you have read some of the stories :p
<alexxm> how've you been Chrysalis
<Eli> DaringDerpy: don't take it as one. I don't really like clop, but sex is a major part of life. and i don't have anything against it in a good story
<Ryunosuke> o/ Chrysalis
<Chrysalis> pretty good
<Chrysalis> :)
<jbh1145> okay here is a goodnot clop romance fic http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19077/Curse-of-The-Werepony
<Moopy> hey guys can all of you crack your hoofs its just like cracking your fist like your knuckles
<Invi> how can youz crack your hoof?
<Deacon> crack....hoves?
<Moopy> yeah
<Ryunosuke> well, sunshine is .. kinda romancy, kinda actiony :)
<DaringDerpy> Ryunosuke: I remember the twilight blimple reading on youtube...I think I've seen it all ^^
<Moopy> i do it sometimes
<Eli> "Sunny skies all day long" is also a good one. it's really short but sweet. no romance. for those who don't like shipping or long reads
<Socks> Greetings BronyState!
<DaringDerpy> too much at once
<Deacon> greeting Socks
<Eli> DaringDerpy: brain overload?
<Ryunosuke> tbh, through the eyes is kinda romancy too
*Socks huggles Deacon
*Deacon huggles back :D
<Eli> hi Socks. missed you today. looked everywhere for you.
<DaringDerpy> something heartbreakingly sad would be nice right now
<Ryunosuke> 'lo socks
<jbh1145> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axOPKmLcriY
<Moopy> Man i wish there was a BronyCon in North Carolina over here
<Eli> Socks: found you in the drawer...
<Ryunosuke> you know
*Socks huggles Ryunosuke and Eli's feet
<Invi> hi Socks
<Ryunosuke> while we are talking about romance novels, and by association clopfics, socks is kinda a bad name to have :p
<DaringDerpy> so...copied all the names to a list. will read them later
<MLP_Brovakiin> A btit late, but Hi Socks! :)
<Invi> Ryunosuke, sexiest name ever xD
<MLP_Brovakiin> *bit
*Socks jumps on Invi and gives him the biggest gug
<DaringDerpy> hi Socks
<Socks> Socks is an awesome name!
<Ryunosuke> gug...
<Ryunosuke> :p
<alexxm> how are things Socks
<jbh1145> clop is weird, sorry to all the clopers but thats what i think
*Socks pushes Invi away and hugs DaringDerpy pausing to say "very good thanks" to alexxm
<Invi> :<
<DaringDerpy> I discovered the clopclop subreddit yesterday. They really seem to like it.
<Ryunosuke> oh doear
<Ryunosuke> dear
<DaringDerpy> :)
<Ryunosuke> there is such a thing?
<Socks> ...Clop... this sounds bad...
<Deacon> I...think it's time to switch subjects....
<Ryunosuke> I should not be surprised being reddit
<jbh1145> STOP TALKING ABOUT CLOP PLz
<DaringDerpy> there is one for everything...there also is an mylittlealcoholic
<DaringDerpy> kk, jbh1145 :)
<Invi> DaringDerpy, hello, ponies are everywhere ^^

<Ryunosuke> morning shizu-chan :)
<Lil_B> hey xD
<Eli> ah... back in the good old days where "clopping" was the pony counterpart of clapping
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya DaringDerpy and Lil_B :)
<Eli> where did we fuck taht up?
<Ryunosuke> eli, I think we just call that clapping :p
<Eli> and hi Lil_B

*Lil_B hugs Invi MLP_Brovakiin and Eli !

*Socks jumps on Sonny and mega hugs him

<Sonny> oh well, up to some tf2
<Sonny> ciao
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Lil_B> Invi http://www.gamemusicbundle.com/
<Ryunosuke> jbh1145, that is an odd question
<jbh1145> Ryunosuke i know
<Deacon> jbh1145 VinylTavia, but I just consider them good friends instead of something romantic
<Ryunosuke> simply because there are alot of good romance stories floating about
<Invi> Lil_B, oh okay ^^
<Socks> jbh1145: The beast from the deep and Bill
<Lil_B> jbh1145 Aida, sometimes the Deutsche Post
<Invi> Lil_B, lool
<jbh1145> socks i meant from mlp
<Lil_B> jbh1145 the paper boat from the CMC
<Socks> Sorry Watcher in the water
<Ryunosuke> hehe Lil_B
<Socks> From MLP, a tree and fluttershy
<Invi> Lil_B, since when does deutsche post shipping?
<jbh1145> Lil_B lol
<Deacon> pfft, ExdeathxShy al the way
<Lil_B> Invi just wanted to say something skuriel
<Invi> okay then
<Ryunosuke> as I said, there are alot of good ones floating abouts, Sunshine (Flutters x OC), Through the eyes (Firewall x Luna)
<Invi> Lil_B, my company does shipping :D
<Ryunosuke> etc, etc, etc
<Eli> Lil_B: :| stop making fun of shipping
<Lil_B> Invi what Company do you work for?
<Lil_B> Eli NEVER!
<Invi> Lil_B, kuehne + nagel
<Lil_B> Invi ... never heard of them :(
<Socks> Eli: But it's such an easy target :P
<Eli> Lil_B: and our Post is better than yours :P
<Lil_B> Eli because you have a smaller country :P
<Invi> Lil_B, yeah they are pretty unknown in germany but they are successfull as hell
<Lil_B> Invi sounds good :)
<jbh1145> i asked a questioin which made the chat explode
<Invi> yep ^^
<Eli> Ryunosuke: just for teh heck of it: who's firewall?
<DaringDerpy> never ship to italy...things tend to get lost. especially in the south
<DaringDerpy> the rest of europe is fine
<DaringDerpy> wisdom of the day
<Invi> good that i dont live there ^^
<Lil_B> Invi don't say that when MadSurge is around :P
<Invi> is he italian?
<Eli> One thought on my part on Fanfictions: DON'T ship your OC with one of the mane six. srly, why would you ever think that's a good idea?
<Lil_B> Invi yup
<Invi> hehe
<Deacon> Eli or any pony in the show in general
<DaringDerpy> or any other pony
<MadSurge> Invi: WHO DARES SHIPPING IN MY PRESENCE :[
<Deacon> or non ponies
<Lil_B> MadSurge xD
<Eli> DaringDerpy: nah shipping is fun
<Lil_B> Invi x MadSurge
<Invi> lool
<MadSurge> Lil_B: :D
<Deacon> or castles, or bears, or trees
<Deacon> especially trains
<MadSurge> Idk even if Invi's a dude :D
<Eli> Deacon: yep. forget OCs. Human X Pony are 2^63 times worse
<MadSurge> ^
<Invi> 2^63? that is more than 2^62 wow
<Eli> Deacon: i once read a clopfic with twilight and her table. to this day i don't know why i cliked on it... and actually went through with reading...:'(
<jbh1145> i do like the spike x rarity ship cause it is kinda cute though it isnt my favorite
<Ryunosuke> eli, that actually, depends on the situation
<Ryunosuke> :p
<Ryunosuke> see: through the eyes :p
<DaringDerpy> sounds interesting, Eli
<alexxm> jbh1145 but spikes a little kid rarity is by my guess 20ish
<Lil_B> Eli well, the hilarious once are the best, although I only ever read one, I'm not much of a reader xD
<Eli> DaringDerpy: it was mind scarring. but yeah...
<Deacon> Eli ...interesting
<DaringDerpy> if it doesn'T kill us...
<Ryunosuke> the thing with spike, is that dragon aging is significantly different from human, or even pony aging standards
<Ryunosuke> like dogs and humans
<Eli> DaringDerpy: it only makes us stranger
<jbh1145> yeah i know like i said its not my favorite
<DaringDerpy> haha
<Invi> Eli, how is such a fic possible?
<Invi> wait
<Invi> I don'tz wanna know
<Eli> DaringDerpy: *Jokersmile*
<Ryunosuke> let me put it this way, a dog year is like 6 human years
<Ryunosuke> or something such
<Eli> Invi: you DON'T wanna know...
<Ryunosuke> two words: Animal Husbandry
<Ryunosuke> :p
<DaringDerpy> so many twilight table fanfics...no chance to find this one
<Invi> ...
<Eli> Ryunosuke: you are starting to scare me a bit...
<Eli> DaringDerpy: really?
<Deacon> wasn't there a fic of trixie and a pinecone? how was that one?
<Ryunosuke> twilight x books can be... awkward too
<Theakman> hey all are we watching anything? my screens buffering :/
<Lil_B> Invi sing the "Dick in a Box" song, and replace Box with Table, at lest that would be an Idea... wait, that doesn't work with females /).-
<jbh1145> spike could be like 3-4 in dragon years but he is probably like 15-16 in pony years
<Lil_B> least*
<Deacon> Theakman why nothing atm good sir/madam
<Theakman> Ok when is stuff getting played UK time?
<Ryunosuke> jbh let me look something up
<Invi> Lil_B, except the table has a storage room...
<J_E_Smith71> Theakman: On the weekdays, stuff is streamed at random times

<[Alpha]> Deacon: I'm remembered? Sweet
<Ryunosuke> that is the CLOSEST I could find to dragon ages
<Invi> Lil_B, has german luna and chryssy the same voice?
<Ryunosuke> regarding MLP
<Eli> Invi: who even watches that?
<Lil_B> Invi I don't think so, sounded really different, but Luna and Nighmare Moon are the sam VA
<Invi> Eli, i sometimes
<Lil_B> ohey [Alpha]
<Ryunosuke> Lil_B, that would make sense though :)
<Invi> Eli, the twily goes insane scene was very good
<Lil_B> Ryunosuke but in the english version, they are different :P
<Lil_B> Eli I watch it :)
<[Alpha]> Sup. I haven't been on because of the mlp game on iOS market and skyrim :3
<Ryunosuke> hmms
<Deacon> huh, that game that addicting?
<Eli> Invi: it has no squee! NO squee :'( fluttershy cries!
<Ryunosuke> [Alpha], I would play that, but... bluestacks doesnt like the android version yet :p
<Ryunosuke> the frontend keeps crashing
<AttackWithHugs> I wanna know why the MLP game is incompatible with my version of Android, yet the new Angry Birds game is :<
<Deacon> because angry birds is a sellout
<Invi> Eli, that is true but that scene ist still awesome
<Ryunosuke> bluestacks is looking at a fix though
<[Alpha]> Kind of but I screwed myself in the game so I have to equal it out
<Ryunosuke> btw, someone ... "finished" that mlp game :p
<Lil_B> Invi and I think Cadence and Chrysalis have the same VA
<[Alpha]> Finished?
<AttackWithHugs> the game says it needs Android 2.3 and up to work and I have 2.3.4
<Invi> Lil_B, idk, maybe. i have t rewatch that episode ^^
<Ryunosuke> as close to finishing as one can get
<Ryunosuke> let me dig up the linky
<Eli> Invi: and i watched fairy odparents or whatever it's called when i was little. can't hear spikes voice :P
<[Alpha]> In fact I'm playing Skrim right now :P
<Invi> Eli, timmy has the same voice. you must be deaf if you don't hear it ^^
<Eli> Invi: that's what i just stated
<Deacon> actually timmy's va is tara strong
<[Alpha]> ^
<Eli> Deacon: german MLP
<Invi> Eli, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHLPg7VNfgM&feature=plcp
<Deacon> oh, german, ok
<Eli> Deacon: in the german version, spike got german timmy's voice
<Lil_B> Eli yeah, the german voice for spike is a VA that does Dubs for +10 years, did tons of Cartoons and Animes
<jbh1145> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR3JdMLAQBs
<[Alpha]> Geez I've banned youtube poop n my home
<Kandarihu> [Alpha], so what do you do when a YTP comes up on the stream?
<Eli> [Alpha]: i don't see what's funny in 95% of those...
<[Alpha]> YTP
<Lil_B> Invi I'm listening to find a Pet "Überirdisch, Übermächtich ... " ganz kla, Tier muss Arisch sein xD
<[Alpha]> Same here Eli it's repetitive penis jokes
<Invi> Lil_B, ikr? and instead of Haustier: Lieblingstier. also the singer VA is too different from the speaking va. the voice changes completely ^^
<Lil_B> yeah, RDs singing voice sounds way different :/
<Eli> [Alpha]: right? nothing against a little immature joke from time to time, but 5 minutes of bullshit?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> FlaschenJoe11 i guess any mod can put you back on the list
<Ryunosuke> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=EFKTJBrLBoU -- SPOILERS,, NMM wins :p
<Invi> afk
<Eli> Invi: how did they voice "Lieblingstier" in pet?
<Invi> (ikr? now really afk)
<Kandarihu> There are some good YTPs. What I see in YTP is a drive to cause the viewer to go What the Heck? at it. It's been corrupted and degraded in a similar manner as trolling. I like a good YTP, but just reediting dialog to change their words into profanity isn't a good YTP.
<[Alpha]> Although I watch gamerpoop it's much more original and funny. Have you ever seen Bulgraf from skyrim break dance?
<Deacon> I usually like the ones that are episodic
<[Alpha]> What is YTP?
<Lil_B> Eli I guess Haustier didn't work, for the song :( or the Translator was High.... again...
<Kandarihu> [Alpha], Youtube Poop
<jbh1145> NOT THAT SONG FROM CUPCAKES!!!!
<[Alpha]> Oh I sometimes dislike abbreviations
<Eli> Lil_B: what is pet again... whatever... something with Tier...
<[Alpha]> Oh I mute it when youtube poop is streamed to answer an earlier question
<Lil_B> Eli Pet = Haustier
<jbh1145> what are good youtube poop?
<Eli> Lil_B: i was trying to sarcasticly imitate the translator. I think i'm still capable of tranlating pet... but i forgot not to use sarcasm over the internet again, didn't I?
<Lil_B> Eli you forgot to give an Indicator :)
<Kandarihu> The YTPs by Kajetokun is pretty funny, Walrusguy did some god ones until he left Youtube...
<Eli> Lil_B: i know, i know... i'm just not used to not using sarcasm
<jbh1145> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHr5mi9graw&feature=related
<[Alpha]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPllpzxmM5k gamerpoop
<Lil_B> Eli really
<Kandarihu> And yes, some of these are pretty dirty and of course I don't enjoy the dirty parts.
<Kandarihu> ...okay, that doesn't go without saying nowadays.
<Lil_B> Eli I mean , reeeeaaaalllllyyyy?
<Eli> Lil_B: not a good trait right?

<Eli> Saturn: that usually helps, doesn't it?
<Ryunosuke> hey Saturn, sup? :)
<Lil_B> hey Saturn ... stop, you still need that head
<Eli> Lil_B: pfff heads... they grow back

<Vivix> She
<Vivix> "She's got her own notebook and quill"
<Lil_B> Eli extra!
<Eli> Lil_B: cool :D i like crazy people.
<Lil_B> Vivix good, I thought the dub got it wrong because all the Fanart I saw portraied it as male
<Vivix> aah
<Lil_B> or the generall shape of the doll seemed more male than female :/
<[Alpha]> Doll?
<Deacon> Smarty pants
<Eli> Lil_B: the fanfictions portrait her as female... another one of the stories i would like to erase from my mind
<Eli> Lil_B: where are the MIB when your really need them?

<Ryunosuke> Vivix, thats oscar
<Vivix> We had a different sesame in Norway- so only seen a few of them
<Ryunosuke> oscar the grouch
<Eli> I don't like oatmeal.
<Saturn> 08,01i found out recently that oatmeal and porridge are actually different
<Vivix> oh yeah
<Saturn> 08,01porridge is rolled oats, which don't require to be soaked, but are not milled
<Ryunosuke> porridge is ... creamier isnt it?
<Saturn> 08,01oatmeal is course milled
<Eli> Saturn: yes. porridge is good.
<Vivix> I love rice-milk-porridge, but rarely enjoy oatmeal
<jbh1145> porridge ewwwwwwwwwwwwww
<Saturn> 08,01i have covered myself in porridge before, but i've never tried oatmeal
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<Saturn> 08,01i'll have to give it a go at some point
<Vivix> Mmm

<Stormy`> Sick?
<Lil_B> SuperBrony64 me too, I want some action
<Bronysith> AHAHAHAHAH
<Bronysith> ninja gaiden 3, what a joke
<Ryunosuke> hey Bronysith

<Bronysith> it doesnt deserve the ninja gaiden title
<Adjeca> nah just didn't feel like going, lol
<Bronysith> why? CAUSE IT IS FUCKING EASY THATS WHY
<Stormy`> lol
<[Alpha]> Bronysith agreed
<Adjeca> got a lot of sick time saved anyway
<Bronysith> ninja gaiden=/= easy
<Lil_B> Bronysith they remade it, now with better controlls, harder difficulty, more blood
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^
<jbh1145> i dare someone to write a great fanfic in 5 minutes with exactly 1000 words no more no less
<Bronysith> ninja gaiden+Easy=ammonia+bleach
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It went up to a 7.6/10 from a 3.0/10
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352917267923.jpg
<Adjeca> hey a new poster just arrived, wanna see it?
<[Alpha]> I can't type that fast
<Stormy`> sure
<Lil_B> on the other hand, it's not out yet xD and I generally don't believe things about games anymore that are just based on the word of mouth
<[Alpha]> Or fast in general
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/MKaah.gif?1
<Adjeca> oki i'll upload it
<[Alpha]> I like to see gameplay and reviews after the official release
<Shizuka> 13so apparently the wii u basic doesn't have enough storage for one game
<Shizuka> 13stay classy consoles
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352899956256.png
<Saturn> 08,01http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13375357/proper-use-cases-for-android-usermanager-isuseragoat
<[Alpha]> Memory issues with the wii u I've read up on that
<Lil_B> Shizuka I guess the basic model is only for Savestates or WiiWare Titles, but that's why you can use external HDs
<ekips> oh wow, it's been just a few days and the Akinator already knows King Sombra
<Vivix> Saturn Have fun on the job! Hehe
<MadSurge> Lil_B: so any obscure games from the SNES era? :D
<alexxm> that has got to be a massive fail Shizuka
<Vivix> Wow, it's actually useable-
<Stormy`> brb, going to class anyways >_>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bronysith: I'm watching a video review on the game now, they're saying they toughened up the difficulty SUBSTANTIALLY.
<Adjeca> haha ok
<Bronysith> still not seeing me buy that shit
<[Alpha]> Ou can only use one external hard drive and it can only be used on the wii u once formatted
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: That's for one game though, other games don't use as much space.
<[Alpha]> You
<jbh1145> what game are you guys talking about
<Shizuka> 13correction, the wii u basic does not have enough storage for more than one game
<Shizuka> 13i can't hear you over the sound of my 80+ steam games :)
<Bronysith> Shizuka: IKR?
<Ryunosuke> tch
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352908274795.gif BEHOLD! THE ULTIMATE TECHNIQUE
<Ryunosuke> steam is nice
<[Alpha]> Shizuka: Nice
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Plus, there's only two reasons to getting the white console, you either love the color white to death, or they ran out of the black deluxe one and you're making do with what they have left.
<Shizuka> 13actually it's more like 120+ but i didn't install most of the id pack
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: You can attach a 3 TB drive to the Wii U and use that for storing games.
<Shizuka> 13you still have to buy more just to use your console the way they want you to :)
<[Alpha]> I don't think they will make that many games
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352890784347.jpg "This is what spike grows up to be"
<BladedWings> oh myh
<BladedWings> *my
<[Alpha]> Gosh
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Or buy games on discs, which is what they anticipate for those who get the white console.
<Shizuka> 13pff discs
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Or they're using the extra money to buy the extra storage
<Shizuka> 13ancient tech
<[Alpha]> Uses 25gb blu ray disks
<Vivix> disc > usb *hugs old stuff*
<Ryunosuke> :)
<[Alpha]> Can't use it as a bluray player though
<Ryunosuke> I smile when everyone talks about distribution of games and such
<jbh1145> when i get the wii u im getting the black one
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It's not a blu-ray disc though
<Lil_B> [Alpha] no Blue Rays, to much pattens money for SONY, they made their own 25GB discs
<jbh1145> DEFINTALY
<Lil_B> ^
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It's similar but a proprietary format
<Ryunosuke> I smile, because without p2p and emulators, that would probbably not have happened :)
<Ryunosuke> hence nintendo/sony stores :0
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But having the ability to plug in a huge amount of storage without forcing users to only use built-in storage was a good move on Nintendo's part.
<[Alpha]> I like the idea of the wii u though but I'm not getting it anytime soon
<MadSurge> Lil_B: why u no answer :(
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Cadance Toss
<Ryunosuke> ...
<Lil_B> MadSurge answer on what? (repeat you question, I had a 20 sec outage :P )
<Ryunosuke> of all the things that came out of s3 premier, we get the cadence cannon game
<Ryunosuke> :)
<MadSurge> Lil_B: any obscure SNES games lately? :D
<Vivix> What I liked hte most with consoles was just using the disc, not installing, anything, so- I think that sounds nice on the WiiU if I understood it correctly
<[Alpha]> Wow they made a cadence toss game already
<Ryunosuke> hmm obscure snes games
<jbh1145> what games do you want for the wii u
<Lil_B> MadSurge what dio you mean? If I played any recently?
<MadSurge> Ryunosuke: and bug eyed Twilight :D
<alexxm> [Alpha] this fandom works fast
<Ryunosuke> MadSurge, true :)
<MadSurge> Lil_B: yes
<Bronysith> >this fandom
<Ryunosuke> and also that G word
<[Alpha]> I noticed xD
<MadSurge> Ryunosuke: those are worthwile memes :D
<Vivix> >>2012
<Ryunosuke> although
<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1352884643315.png
<Lil_B> MadSurge nope, haven't played much latly anyway :/ and currently playing Cossacks
<[Alpha]> I'm gonna need a new computer soon
<Ryunosuke> the premier DID give a new meaning to Pinkie Shy :)
<MadSurge> Lil_B: what's that?
<Bronysith> the premiere
<Bronysith> god
<alexxm> i liked the premiere
<[Alpha]> Lol I have that picture
<Bronysith> "HURR DURR, a commercial aired during our show, lets make a meme out of it HURR DURR"
<MadSurge> alexxm: same
<Bronysith> god
<SuperBrony64> 11,02jbh1145: I plan on getting Mew Super Mario Bros. U, Call of Duty Black Ops II, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, and Nintendo Land. I also might get Ninja Gaiden because it looks awesome.
<MadSurge> Bronysith: ssh, concentrate on the Cadence launcher
<[Alpha]> Mew
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moooo
<MadSurge> MOOOO
<Lil_B> MadSurge an age of ampires like game, just with more units, and it'sa the 16-18th century
<Deacon> did somebody say Mew? http://derpy.me/ZYq4s
<[Alpha]> O.o I was just noting a spell error which was funny
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: gаk>>>gangnam
<jbh1145> @SuperBrony64 For me New SUper Mario Bros U, Sonic Racing Transformed, Nintendo Land(well it comes with the dexluxe set so duh)
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I c
<Shizuka> 13http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2012/11/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-2-weapon-chart.png
<jbh1145> For games in the future, Rayman Legends, Pikmin 3, and Smash Bros U
<jbh1145> im not a fan of call of duty
<MadSurge> Shizuka: all those weapons and not one plasma rifle or a BFG :(
<SuperBrony64> 11,02jbh1145: You getting it at launch?
<[Alpha]> I think I'll probably be switching to pc gaming soon
<jbh1145> im getting it for christmas
<Shizuka> 13looks like six weapons to me
<Shizuka> 13with randomized stats
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: That chart
<Lil_B> SuperBrony64 starting of slowly, ZombiU, Lego City Undercover, The Wonderful 101, Bayonetta 2 and mayxbe Tank!Tank!Tank
<Shizuka> 13does not contain gun that shoots shurikens and lightning
<MadSurge> Shizuka: EXACTLY
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm for sure getting Bayonetta 2 when it comes out :D
<Bronysith> only for wii u is bullshit
<SuperBrony64> 11,02jbh1145: Awesome! :D
<Shizuka> 13the whole "modern war shooter" thing is hilariously stifling
<jbh1145> Lil_B Oh i forget about lego city
<MadSurge> By the way, is Painkiller available on steam?
<alexxm> i wonder what the wii u version of arkham city has thats new
<Shizuka> 13MadSurge: ofc
<Bronysith> MadSurge: yup
<Shizuka> 13cheap too
<jbh1145> probably will get that
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bronysith: Again, it eouldn't exist without Nintendo's help.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02wouldn't*
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> black ops 2 the game with a score of 86 but a user score of 3.0
<MadSurge> Shizuka: another game to hoarde and play on a better computer later :$
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Really?
<alexxm> how've you been Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Lil_B> hey Sketch_Toku_Brony !
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> really
<Shizuka> 13course the wii u is going to be the first technological upgrade consoles have had in seven years so
<Bronysith> WHEN is the steam holiday sales starting?
<Vivix> during the holidays I presume
<Bronysith> Vivix: oh right
<Bronysith> :P{
<Vivix> so probably late december
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> alexxm im good :)
<Bronysith> Vivix: you spending any money on there? i cant cause im saving to get a hotel room for a con
<Shizuka> 13remember, when xbox 360 came out, having two threads execute in the same cycle was the newest big deal, multicore processors weren't even a thing
<Sonic> :) hey
<Vivix> Probably not, but if anything amazing pops up I probably will, Usually only buy one or two when there's a big sale
<Shizuka> 13now, asuka can run 12 threads in the same cycle, consoles can't even come close to PC
<[Alpha]> That is true
<Vivix> Consoles does make it cheaper for us to buy gcards though
<Bronysith> Shizuka: you named your pc asuka?
<Shizuka> 13quantitatively asuka is over six times more advanced than the 360
<Vivix> if you look at it this way: Console keeps game-specs down
<Kammerjunk> I'm excited for new consoles. If nothing else, then because I'm a gamer at heart, and while graphics aren't everything, they sure look nice.
<jbh1145> i hope the wii u will be a great launch and not like the 3ds and ds launch
<[Alpha]> ^
<Shizuka> 13Bronysith: you just now learned?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The Wii U's heatsink is only three times larger than the Wii's heatsink and thr fan is about teice as big, those two items were extremely small on the Wii so they must really have a lot of power efficiency going on with the processors to maintain at least on-par performance with other current concoles with a substantially smaller design.
<jbh1145> it probably will though cause a mario game is a launch game
<alexxm> well it should be looks like it has some good launch games
<Shizuka> 13except the wii was released seven years ago and hasn't changed since
<Shizuka> 13of course the wii u is better than it
<RaveBrony> :I
<Vivix> Seven years ago? Jeez-- I feel old
<[Alpha]> So much truth
<RaveBrony> Ikr?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: nope, but you did confirm the suspicions
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But the size of the components hasn't changed drastically which is amazing imo
<jbh1145> Vivix i agree
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kids still going on with the console vs pc war ?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> just enjoy your games and get on with it
<Vivix> not a war per se
<Shizuka> 13right, because tech has improved since then, it's just wii u is *just now* catching up
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: YES
<Vivix> There's been no mud or fire yet
<[Alpha]> I'm going with the flow here
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> agreed TheGreatAndPowerfulT /)
<Shizuka> 13sony's apparently crashing hard, i'll be impressed if there is a PS4
<jbh1145> i play mostly on consoles but i still play tf2 and minecraft on pc
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: thank you, another person to represent the flag
<Bronysith> Shizuka: there is a persona 4
<Bronysith> XD i know what you mean though
<Shizuka> 13as for microsoft, between windows 8 and their insistence on kinect, i'm wondering if they'll make it to a new generation of consoles
<Vivix> Playstation 4
<[Alpha]> I hope so
<jbh1145> i like windows 8 FLAME SHILED READY
<Bronysith> i think xbox is leaving the gaming race
<Vivix> We'll just have to wait and see, it wouldn't be the first console to vanish
<Bronysith> nope
<[Alpha]> I think the ps3 and Xbox 360 is slowly dying now
<Vivix> W8 Isn't that bad- most of the flair is optional, and so is appstore
<Vivix> I've yet to personally try it though
<Bronysith> but doesnt matter to me, i have my playstation 3 mostly for games i find on the PSN, AKA Legend of dragoon, FFVI-VIII, persona 3 later on
<Vivix> We have a PS3, but I haven't touched it in ages
<[Alpha]> I want the new generation of gaming consoles now so I can play Kingdom Hearts 3
<jbh1145> i hope wii u will dominate in sales like the wii did
<Vivix> I played Red dead on it, that's about it-
<Kammerjunk> [Alpha]: Being a PC only gamer, I'd say that's a good thing, but consoles are good if you don't want to spend money on a gaming rig.
<Vivix> True
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You have to remember though, there's a difference Shizuka between hardware that can play games and hardware designed specifically to play games. The components may be weaker than what you get on computers, but they are designed specifically just for games and also to keep costs low. Besides, games on consoles only have to push games out on a 1080p display whereas most hardcore gamers
<SuperBrony64> 11,2have displays that are double that resolution anyway.
<Shizuka> 13but that's the thing
<Shizuka> 13what makes it to PC is dumbed down ports
<[Alpha]> I'm not big on pc but they started it all
*Vivix does not have over 1080, does not want over 1080
<jbh1145> what game systems do you guys own?
<Vivix> Personally? Just a computer
<Shizuka> 13developers that think releasing a game on PC with an FOV of 65 need to lose their kneecaps
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Because PCs aren't as big of a focus compared with consoles.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, my screen is 1920x1200. I tell you, finding wallpapers is a hell.
<Shizuka> 13it's holding the medium back
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: FOV of 65? That sounds terrible.
<Vivix> It is holding back in certain departments yeah
<[Alpha]> I find wallpapers that exceed that KammerJunk
<Vivix> Especially controll, feedback and graphics is being held down by porting
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Call of Duty used to be a PC game, but since Modern Warfare 2, you can easily see that the games are designed with concoles in mind first and PCs second.
<Shizuka> 13Kammerjunk: halo 2, the big "hey look directx 10 on vista" release, was locked to 65
<Vivix> yeah, consoles are a bigger market-
<Shizuka> 13you had to use a trainer to force it higher
<[Alpha]> I like the mods on pc though. They make the game more enjoyable
<Vivix> Jeez-
<jbh1145> what is your favorite wii game?
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/dyEeE.jpg oh Shizuka
<Kammerjunk> [Alpha]: Yeah, but most wallpapers are 1080p. Then again, I suppose I just have to look for anything in 16:10 with 1920x1200 as a minimum size.
<[Alpha]> Super Smash brothers Brawl
<Shizuka> 13i already have that one silly
<jbh1145> the mario galaxy games for me
<SuperBrony64> 11,02So think of it this way, do I want to go out and built an $800+ computer to play CoD or buy an Xbox 360 for $250.
<Ryunosuke> [Alpha], I have to agree with that, mods do make a game more enjoyable most times
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Plus convenience and simplicity factor in a lot with buying a concole.
<[Alpha]> I liked the mlp mods On skyrim. They are funny but need some work
<Bronysith> dem mods
<Shizuka> 13if you're building a computer over $800, you're not building it for COD
<Shizuka> 13you're building it for better games
<Ryunosuke> ^]
<Kammerjunk> Ryunosuke: And that's why I can't play Bethesda games on anything else than PC.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: i didnt spend 1800$ to play CoD thats for sure
<Shizuka> 13if you want to build a computer for COD you buy a system from 2004
<Mourekai> you guys are gonna kill me, but I play skyrim on PC with no mods
<Vivix> That reminds me, I need a horse mod for Skyrim- their butts are all wrong
<Mourekai> and I know how to install them :P
<[Alpha]> I'll have to build a pc when I get the chance. It sounds like fun.
<Vivix> Mourekai, I usually do the same until about 2 years after release
<Kammerjunk> Mourekai: That's alright. But FYI, there are clients like the Nexus Mod Manager that do all the work for you.
<Shizuka> 13again, because consoles are so out of date, making the price comparison now is moot
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/TLKKb.jpg
<MadSurge> http://i.imgur.com/nQx3p.jpg ಠ_ಠ
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Maybe so, but from my perspective, I would rather buy a console than a gaming computer. I love hooking it up to my TV and picking up a controller and I'm ready to play.
<Kammerjunk> [Alpha]: Call me crazy, but building a PC is great fun.
<Shizuka> 13but then the next gen console comes out
<Shizuka> 13now you have to buy new hardware
<Shizuka> 13PC is already running smoothly at that level
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But for what concoles do, it's still good enough to push out the same games that can be found on PCs albeit with some tweaking.
<[Alpha]> Thanks for the feedback. I will try it when I get a job >.>
<Shizuka> 13and the next gen after that, PC is still waiting to need the upgrade
<Vivix> SuperBrony64, I don't see anything wrong with that, but it is two different systems and 'cultures' between PC and Consoles
<Bronysith> if your pc can run crysis you dont need to update
<jbh1145> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsAR25SnUGY
<Shizuka> 13Bronysith: 60fps solid through the whole game, all settings maxed :)
<Vivix> I can run several crysis'es ontop of eachother
<Bronysith> Shizuka: hell yea
<Shizuka> 13even AA which guarantees rendering lag
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Vivix: Indeed, but the argument 'LULZ MY P4 PC CAN OUTPERFORM AN XBOX 360' is just tiring.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: you're good for a few decades of gaming
<Kammerjunk> I some times try to run SWTOR and EVE Online at the same time. Good gracious, TOR can eat resources.
<Vivix> I have aa on max on everything I own- even with my old computer- never really suffered , CPU picks up tons of slack
<Shizuka> 13SuperBrony64: the core of the issue is what PC is getting these days is half assed ports of console games that completely ignore the platform they're moving to
<Vivix> SuperBrony64, totally agree, that's why I think it's a different market and culture- PC's aren't Solely gaming devices- so in some cases you save money by JUST having a pc, but- preference matters the most
<Shizuka> 13i do not sit six feet from my monitor, i don't need to look at the screen like it's a telescope
<Bronysith> Shizuka: also DUAL MONITORS
<Vivix> Porting is an issue though, it really really breaks some games on release, or forever
<Shizuka> 13i have a controller with 102 inputs, you can give me more options to interact with the game
<Vivix> but that's a dev-argument more than a consumer one
<[Alpha]> I have bad eyesight so I sit like 5 inches away from my computer screen x(
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: I don't think I can live without at least two monitors anymore.
<Invi> [Alpha], you know, that's what glasses are invented for?
<[Alpha]> I do like that we are not bashing each other :)
<SuperBrony64> 11,02PCs are for those who want to push the limit of games and mod them like crazy, consoles are for simplicity, they are 'plug and play' friendly.
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: i need to get it set up like the jigsaw killer, get like 10 monitors up in this bitch
<Mourekai> two monitors limit your GPU
<Vivix> Exactly
<Kammerjunk> [Alpha]: I'm just -0.75 and -1.00, so I sometimes forget to put in my lenses when I'm sitting at my computer.
<Mourekai> it's not good unless you have multicore or sli/cf
<jbh1145> am i the only one who wants a mario galaxy 3?
<[Alpha]> Invi: all my glasses fall apart of their own accord
<Kammerjunk> Mourekai: Who doesn't have multicore these days, though?
<Mourekai> I mean multicore GPU
<Vivix> I don't use two monitors, never saw the point, did before- but now I have a U824 soundcard- and the mixer takes up the entire screen
<Mourekai> like 690
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<alexxm> i have no idea what multicore means but i'm sure i have it
<Invi> [Alpha], what do you do with them?
<[Alpha]> Nothing
<SuperBrony64> 11,02jbh1145: I want it...but if they can make a Super Mario 3D Land like game on the Wii U...I'm much more in favor of that :)
<Shizuka> 13Vivix: life on screen one, bronystate on screen two
<Bronysith> The thing is, i am sick of this console VS pc gaming argument, games are fun,, hell even though i play PC games more often than console, WE all share the same flag that is gaming, i was raised on an N64, SNES, PS2, xbox, gamecube and PC, and i loved all the games i played on em, so if you enjoy a game then GAME THE FUCK ON
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: But what if they're the same?
<Vivix> Hehe, yeah- I'm super used to one monitor though, but the mixer is--eating my screen
<Shizuka> 13only during streams
<Invi> [Alpha], then change the manufacturer
<jbh1145> looking at your guys pc specs make me jealous, my pc sucks for gaming, it can really only play tf2 and minecraft
<Shizuka> 13in which case stream on 1, irc on 2
<Kammerjunk> Good point.
<Vivix> For streaming and modding I would want two screens
<[Alpha]> I haven't bout glasses in 3 years
<Vivix> modding as in administrating
<[Alpha]> Bought
<Vivix> We used three screens in the main studio at my school, but we only used the center one <,<
<Invi> [Alpha] do you have to drive a car?
<Shizuka> 13Bronysith: it's the sense that everyone knows games can do better, but they won't because they're developing for decade old hardware
<jbh1145> and im using an hp all in one so i cant replace anything
<[Alpha]> Not yes
<[Alpha]> Yet
<Kammerjunk> jbh1145: Well, you can just build on it progressively. I add some RAM here, a harddrive there.
<Shizuka> 13so it's the indies that actually evolve the medium
<Bronysith> Shizuka: this is true
<Invi> [Alpha], then it is fine yet
<Kammerjunk> jbh1145: Oh. Never mind then.
<Shizuka> 13minecraft alone shows the problem :3
<Vivix> http://www.trondertun.no/uploads/bilder/galleri/Lyd/lydstudio.jpg studio at my old school
<Bronysith> Vivix: that you?
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: I am so jelly, you could smear me on toast.
<Mourekai> are any of you anticipating DayZ full?
<Vivix> oh nono, it's a promo shot from their website
*pony_017447 asks to be ignored.
<Bronysith> Vivix: so that is you then
<Kammerjunk> pony_017447: Alrighty then!
<Vivix> noo ;__;
<Shizuka> 13but anyway
<Bronysith> Vivix: NOW U FUCKED UP
*Vivix hugs hard
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: Wait, are you Norwegian?
<Vivix> Yeah
<jbh1145> you cant replace the video card which is the only thing i need to replace to get at least playable framerates
<[Alpha]> I think it's sad though. 18 and can't drive x(
<Kammerjunk> Neat!
<Vivix> I'm 23 and I can't drive-
<Vivix> you are danish right?
<Vivix> or am I confusing you with someone
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<alexxm> i'm 18 and i'm currently learning how to drive
<Vivix> Woo, memory
<[Alpha]> No
<[Alpha]> Well I can drive....just not legally ....
<Kammerjunk> I can crash.
<jbh1145> unless there is some crazy thing like a pci to pci express adapter which im sure there isnt
<Invi> yeah mainly because your eyesight is so bad ^^
<Vivix> I can crash too
<Vivix> I think there is jbh, but a PCIe motherboard is cheap
<Deacon> oh that sucks [Alpha]
<jbh1145> i dont know if i can replace the motherboard on my all in one
<Vivix> You should be able to replace everything, unless it's--something weird, or rented
<[Alpha]> My eyesight is borderline so I can drive without glasses weird right?
*Vivix googles all in one
<jbh1145> plusthe power supply on it is only 150 watts, wayyyy to little for a normal video card
<Vivix> oh no way it's just a screen?
<Vivix> oh my
<Vivix> mine's 850 watts
<Kammerjunk> I don't even remember what my power supply is.
<Stormy`> back again :P
<Vivix> I usually forget my stats, but my computer is still new

<Shizuka> 13you can get tf2 to run better by severely downgrading the graphics, but minecraft is about the most you can ask from intel integrated
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you need to burn them a disc and they play it.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its retarded.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> even made an OC based on him :$ http://kamenartistsamueru.deviantart.com/gallery/39025865#/d5bhwet
<Stormy`> =/
<Vivix> Minecraft is a totall monster of java
<Invi> lol dat Cadance toss game
<jbh1145> @Shizuka i do that
<Stormy`> what's their reason for that?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> because stupid.
<Bronysith> Sketch_Toku_Brony: so going in the bad pony oc tumblr
<Shizuka> 13and yeah java's an unapologetic hog and you'll have to decrease render distance to make minecraft smooth but it's functional
<Mourekai> Good job, Shining Armor!
<[Alpha]> Weird I'm participating >.>
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Bronysith: lol nah i just like drawing :D
<Stormy`> of course
<Bronysith> Sketch_Toku_Brony: and this stops me how?
<Bronysith> "devilish grin"
<Vivix> I wonder if it'll ever be rewritten in another language
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> they also make you pay licensing fees
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Bronysith: well if you wanna do an OC tumblr i wont stop ya :$
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> for anything thats not currently being shown at their theater
<Stormy`> I hope those 70 people aren't all the creepy guys from that brony group...
<[Alpha]> Sounds like an OC tumblr would be a pain
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> 40 of them are from vancouver
<Shizuka> 13asuka's maxed out due to the motherboard, but phenom II x6 at 2.4GHz, 8GB ram, 1.5TB internal plus 2TB external drive, and 1GB radeon hd 5750 running two monitors
<jbh1145> minecraft does run pretty well when everything is low but some textures appear black
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> which is like an hour away
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but they wanna drive.. so whatever.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Im not giving any weridos rides.
<Vivix> the black texture is a bug in the game
<Bronysith> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdf5d49N8e1rncbeqo1_500.jpg dafuq
<Vivix> so that happens on every system
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> MAN the actor for Katsumi/Eternal can sing! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZiJwasME2o
<Chrysalis> 5750? i used to have one of those
<Vivix> I suck at reading ATI names-
<Chrysalis> nice cards
<Chrysalis> take a beating
<jbh1145> even my hand in the game turns black sometimes
<Vivix> oh wow, that I've never seen
<Chrysalis> Vivix, i have never seen that myself
<jbh1145> the signs sometimes turn black sometimes too
<Shizuka> 13that would be intel
<[Alpha]> Intel sucks
<Shizuka> 13naturally generated overhangs with black lighting is a big
<Vivix> It's a shadow-bug, isn't it? I've seen it a few times, many times actually
<Shizuka> 13black textures on their own is intel
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> also
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> topic
<jbh1145> intel makes great cpus but they suck with gpus
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "rip dad"
<Vivix> ohh, okay
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> who?
<Stormy`> Kimori's dad
<jbh1145> Amd makes alright cpus but great gpus, see the pattern
<Shizuka> 13i've heard sandybridge is supposed to be better but i just don't see intel coming close to discrete cards
<[Alpha]> Hmm
<Bronysith> http://www.dorkly.com/comic/46282/the-people-you-see-at-a-midnight-release
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> aww :(
<Vivix> integrated seems to be mainly for 2d acceleration for UI- running games on it is kinda crazy
<[Alpha]> Wow I've been more interested in this than Skyrim
<Shizuka> 13indeed it's probably impossible as an integrated graphics chip has to share thread time with the main CPU and draws its graphics memory from main RAM
<Bronysith> [Alpha]: what game?
<jbh1145> though nvidia makes the best gpus, thats a fact
<Vivix> nVidia vs AMD is a battle I never got into- but I've preferred nVidia for ages
<Shizuka> 13nvidia's stomping AMD into the ground, i only picked up the radeon build because it was cheaper than the comparable nvidia
<Bronysith> [Alpha]: what game?
<Shizuka> 13now and then i regret it
<[Alpha]> Skyrim
<Rocket> Hello :)
<[Alpha]> And this chat
<Bronysith> [Alpha]: you said you were more interested in this than skyrim
<Vivix> GTX670 is something I--don't regret buying, but honestly, I could not seee any improvement in games
<Shizuka> 13this == chat
<Saturn> 08,01i generally get nvidia because it's easier to get working with Linux
<Vivix> but it will keep me updated ofr quite a while
<Saturn> 08,01or rather, it has been historically
<Bronysith> [Alpha]: do u play the fallout series by chance?
<Shizuka> 13for me it was a huge improvement from the geforce 8300gs i'd been stuck on for two years
<jbh1145> plz i want to build a new computer to play battlefield 3
<Shizuka> 13and from there a big improvement from the fx5200 i'd been on since 04 <<
<[Alpha]> Yes
<Rocket> is there any stream going on ???
<Bronysith> [Alpha]: which is your fav fallout game then?
<Vivix> I can't remember the name of my old card
<jbh1145> yes i could play it on my ps3 but its not really the true exprenice
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> this is your christmas present. http://i.imgur.com/pNtY6.jpg
<[Alpha]> To be honest
<Vivix> The biggest improvement I felt was when I upgraded from P4 3.2ghz to i7 3.4
<Vivix> it was like--walking out of a cube of slime
<[Alpha]> It's on my things to do list
<Bronysith> [Alpha]: what?
<Snow> help me D: im addicted to that gameloft app!
<Rocket> is there any stream going on ???
<Shizuka> 13i can make asuka chug hard but dual monitors means i make her do a whole lot more than my previous boxen
<jbh1145> its like playing tf2 on the console orange box game
<Invi> Rocket, nope
<jbh1145> nobody plays it
<Rocket> Invi thanks, i just thought i have epic lag :3
<Invi> ...when was actually the last stream?
<Vivix> Dual takes out quite a lot huh? I haven't had dual since... well, years
<Shizuka> 13it's not a lot as far as i can tell
<Bronysith> i need to name my pc
<Vivix> Even though I don't really want it- I kinda want to consider it due ot my new audiocard-
<alexxm> Invi last night at least thats the last time i saw one
<jbh1145> im wondering what would be a good build for around 1000 dollars?
<[Alpha]> I don't name anything. Well except I named my iPad awesome >.>
<Vivix> I think I'll stick with one- for now- desk is small
<Bronysith> jbh1145: go for 1500$
<Shizuka> 13screen two is generally just putty and skype, and while putty is constantly updating to demonstrate the network connection is still live, it's not exactly crysis on screen two
<Vivix> Hehe, true
<Invi> silly putty? ^^
<alexxm> whats putty
<Shizuka> 13ssh client
<Vivix> if I had two, I would want to run eh dspmixer or something on the second-
<jbh1145> im good enough with 1000 dollars, i dont care about getting the best framerate, i just want to at least play it
<Invi> what is ssh?
<Adjeca> oh, here's that poster i got http://i.imgur.com/RxGqn.jpg?1
<Vivix> Secure shell? *sucks at netstuff*
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> did you steal it
<Stormy`> Oh yay, AOL
<Vivix> I use it during GIT, apparently, but I suck at git too
<Stormy`> Just what I've always wanted
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> from like toys r us or something
<jbh1145> so any suggestions?
<[Alpha]> I'm out techy stuff just goes over my head but it makes me wanna research it so that I'll be more knowledgable in that area
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy` dont use all your 500 minutes at one time.
<Vivix> well, what country are you in jbh1145 ?
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/KP0JM.jpg this is me atm
<Biggestpinkiefan> Movie night is nearing >:)

<[Alpha]> Snow ...I must check right away
<Stormy`> They're really going all out with the merchandising
<jbh1145> well first off where is the best place to get computer parts from? Newegg or Amazon?
<Adjeca> i didn't know they did either.. o.o
<Amu-chan> AOL still exists?
*thelonepony noms on SuperBrony64 :3
<alexxm> why not both
<Vivix> jbh1145, I don't know much about american stores and prices- sorry, but I'd say you could get pretty decent around 1000- but best is 15-1800
*Shizuka 13says as she still hasn't cracked open this coke from when she woke up...
<Biggestpinkiefan> Anypony excited to see my fave pony get cloned in the next episode?
<jbh1145> alright
<Shizuka> 13jbh1145: parts, newegg
<Shizuka> 13prebuilt, amazon or the manufacturers directly
<Adjeca> i wish they had more toys and such from when the first trilogy was going on
<Shizuka> 13asuka's a gateway from amazon, was a good sale
<jbh1145> though like i said im not gonna get parts for a long time yet
*SuperBrony64 noms on thelonepony back :3
<thelonepony> :3
<Stormy`> They had some... I never found much though
<Vivix> Computers aren't as scary to put together as it might look, I learned it at a pretty young age
<Shizuka> 13$800 for these specs, was normally just under 1k
<thelonepony> oh, sprunkls isn't here ;3;
*Biggestpinkiefan noms on muffin and gives one to derpy
<Stormy`> I have a plush and an inflatable from the state fair with like 50 holes in it
<jbh1145> i5 or i7?
<Biggestpinkiefan> :3 anypony else want one?
<Shizuka> 13amd phenom ii x6, six core
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> why did you put so many holes in it? practicing for your murderous rampage?
<Stormy`> I think it's still in my closet at my parents' house
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> the 2 in 1 pony detective,KaMane Stallion W http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmzi43GMsc1qkm3xxo1_500.jpg
<Stormy`> Lol no, it was just flimsy and broke for no reason
<Adjeca> hahaha
<aniderp> hey everyone
<Shizuka> 13they had an i7 with nvidia for i think $900, but that was 2010 and seems the prebuilts cycle out fairly quickly
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and magically got 50 holes in it.
<alexxm> how've you been aniderp
<thelonepony> Biggestpinkiefan: sorry, full from nomming on SB :3
<Snow> :o Caramel now costs bits...INSTABUY
<jbh1145> they dont have the x6 on newegg
<aniderp> im ok
*Biggestpinkiefan throws cupcakes into everyones mouthes
<thelonepony> Ohai Snow :3
<Stormy`> it's called hyperbole :P
<aniderp> nuu i want muffins
<Vivix> Some gamers say i5 is better for games, some say i7 is- so I ahve no idea
<Biggestpinkiefan> IF YOU DONT WANT EM NOW SAVE EM! :D
<Adjeca> hmm what kind of inflatable?
<Vivix> I got a i7, as it wasn't that expensive when I did
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Biggestpinkiefan: Watch the spoilers please
<BladedWings> hi aniderp
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/OChA9.jpg
<Stormy`> although I did make it much worse by trying to fix the holes...
<Biggestpinkiefan> SPOILERS?
<Biggestpinkiefan> what spoilers?
<jbh1145> well should i get ivy bridge or sandy bridge
<thelonepony> he ment dont spoil it
<thelonepony> or perma ban
<Stormy`> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs4/i/2004/259/6/d/Inflatable_Spyro_by_mizskellington.jpg
<Stormy`> Like that
<thelonepony> will happen
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Trying to eat when your nose is stuffed up sucks
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> id stab that too.
<Shizuka> 13sandybridge is their replacement for the older intel integrated chips, but it's still integrated graphics
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I almost choked on a cracker this morning
<Snow> :| need 137 magic shards
<Stormy`> one of the legs makes a squeaking noise when you squeeze it for some strange reason
<Vivix> but i7 comes with sandy or ivy
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Biggestpinkiefan: You're talking about the next episode before it has been aired for at least 24 hours. Nothing terribly serious what you've said so far, but just watch it.
<Vivix> when I got it, it was ivy only
<jbh1145> i gotta go
<Adjeca> ah nice
<thelonepony> what SB Said :U
<[Alpha]> Okay
<Vivix> he is?--oh my
<Biggestpinkiefan> everypony knows what it is abot
<MadSurge> http://i.imgur.com/0QpVS.png :P
<Vivix> no, I don't
<Biggestpinkiefan> before i even said it!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> ok why did this guy apply for financing for his trailer in the amount of $1650 when the trailer clearly says $1600...
<Vivix> I have no idea what is going on~~
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oh god! :D lol Rarity WOULD say something like that :D http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/bar1scorpio/random%2520doodles/Macros/MLP-HappyEnding.jpg
<thelonepony> ^
<Invi> MadSurge, lol
<XAX> thelonepony: Not a permaban. 24 hour ban, if you actually read the topic.
<thelonepony> oh really :#
<Stormy`> He wants to give you $50
<thelonepony> :$*
<[Alpha]> Wtf?
<Vivix> it used to be perma I think
<Vivix> before the premiere
<Stormy`> obviously
<Dark92Enigma> i'm back
<Vivix> no wait--24
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> MadSurge: :D
<Dark92Enigma> 24 hours
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I think im going to get my license for selling insurance.
<MLP_Brovakiin> welcome back Dark92Enigma :)
<Dark92Enigma> i know, i got banned
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> then I can really take people for a ride.
*Biggestpinkiefan eats a cupcakes
<Snow> 24 hours....Valve time
<Dark92Enigma> before the premiere
<thelonepony> wb Dark92Enigma :)
<Vivix> Valve Time
<Vivix> should be a game
<Biggestpinkiefan> VALVE CAN COUNT TO 3!!!
<Biggestpinkiefan> :O
<thelonepony> dat overused joke
<Vivix> It'll be out! Eventually
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Mane 6 are best Kamen Riders :D http://lgrtp.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/93658-crossover-kamen_rider-kamen_rider_double-kamen_rider_w-mane_6.png

<thelonepony> Bye Sn- damn it :I
<Adjeca> oh my
<thelonepony> Biggestpinkiefan: good thing sprunkls isnt here to see that :I
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man i hope they show Scootaloo's parents in S3,all these "Scoots is an orphan on the streets" fic are so sad >.<
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "I need an idea for an OC and name"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "CanHurr Smashdick"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes, great suggestion..
<[Alpha]> Also kind of a random thought. People say she live in Cloudsdale but she can't fly....
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "SHITLORD THE ALMIGHTY, HIS CUTIEMARK IS SHIT"
<Vivix> I always thought cloudsdale was too far away for her to live there and go to that school
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "you have tits?"
<Vivix> so Always assumed Ponyville
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "very manly tits"
<Vivix> I like Crippleloo though
<Stormy`> ...wtf?
<[Alpha]> Makes sense
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<Vivix> Yo, dawg
<thelonepony> Hi Nittany_Discord :)
<Stormy`> http://images5.fanpop.com/image/polls/984000/984886_1332801659147_full.png Made me think of this guy
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "And don't say you're already at home.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> You're doing the Gangnam Style dance outside my window in your underwear holding a bottle of russian vodka."
<MLP_Brovakiin> heya Nittany_Discord :)
<MadSurge> Hello Nittany_Discord :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> this is all quotes from the brony facebook page.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: hello aniki nii-chan
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> the same OC thread.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai Nittany_Discord :3
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> if she gets her cutie mark from riding her scooter,lol do ya think a pro scooter rider named Pony Buck should show up? :D
<Stormy`> I would be terrified that I live near those people
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> We will probably never see their cutiemarks, but it would make a nice goodbye
<slenderkitty> wow ponies are on
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "Who the hell decided that Bronies/Pegasisters were founded on the idea of "Love and Tolerance?"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Because that certainly isn't the case nowadays."
<Vivix> or "future" things
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "Oh yeah? well my comments aren't just smart and whitty, they also contain racial slurs."
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> yeah but if thats the case then i dont want them to get their cutie marks till 2045 :D Ponies 4ever!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "nigger"
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> Booyah
<Vivix> but yeah if they got them- we would probably see less of them, but you never know
<Biggestpinkiefan> is anyone else just getting a buffer on their screen?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "Shaylee is a girl who has fantasies of being chained to a wall as a zombie."
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "like feathered fuckass and horny asswaffle?"
<Biggestpinkiefan> like, where the video usally is?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No Im getting muffins
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> stay classy..
<SpadeMagnes[School]> :P
<[Alpha]> I'm on a chat client
<thelonepony> No Buffer show is on you sillieh :3
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Vivix: maybe itll time skip and theyll pass the CMC title onto...Pound and Pumpkin maybe?
<MadSurge> :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Oh and theres a thread about some sort of erotic fanfiction im not going to open.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> At first being immortal sounds cool, then it becomes a curse really
<alexxm> Sketch_Toku_Brony well i can't find it but it's a picture of the madoka girls as riders
<MadSurge> Sketch_Toku_Brony: and then Egophiliac came into the show :D

<GilDash> Alchemist: I know that feeling.
<Rainbow_Swaggin> anypony here?
<GilDash> Nope.
<MadSurge> ^
<GilDash> We all left ages ago.
<Rainbow_Swaggin> :C
<Alchemist> MadSurge: was at uni from 8 in the morning till 8 in the evening with literally NO break
<SpadeMagnes[School> Im back
<SpadeMagnes[School> God damn internet cut out for a moment
<MadSurge> Alchemist: Damn, you're made of iron
<Rainbow_Swaggin> i just wanted to say how dissapointed i was at sombra
<XAX> I was going through Facebook. I didn't leave.
<Rainbow_Swaggin> and i cant wait for the sseasons end, twi has something coming
<MadSurge> Sombra's legacy will go on
<thelonepony> lets not discuss S3 pls
<thelonepony> :S
<XAX> Hey Nittany_Discord. Played BO2 at all yet?
<Alchemist> I have a feeling that we may meet him again later.
<GilDash> Well, yesterday I went to work, came back and did nothing but write and iron until about 11 o'clock. Then I basically was passing out, so I decided to sleep. XD
<SpadeMagnes[School> Needs more buss
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man the new DmC coming 2013 looks awesome! wish so many hard core fans werent sooo bitchy :| all because of Dante's look and other pointless stuff
*SpadeMagnes[School rides around in the shizubus
<Rainbow_Swaggin> sombra was the only villan to actually be killed
<Shizuka> 13beep beep
<Rainbow_Swaggin> makes sense hed come back
<MadSurge> Rainbow_Swaggin: since G1
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Played a bit last night.
<thelonepony> Rainbow_Swaggin: he's made out of darkness
<Shizuka> 13after my pizza comes out i think we will need to have some bus
<Bronysith> Sketch_Toku_Brony: how is that pointless?
<Shizuka> 13i wonder if i can take a bus through a car wash
<Bronysith> Sketch_Toku_Brony: it would be like completely rearanging the mona lisa man
<SpadeMagnes[School> So...Nightmare moon basicly being wiped from existince doesnt count as being killed?
<Shizuka> 13that and you guys need to show me where the super swingset is
<XAX> Nittany_Discord: Whadaya think?
<Rainbow_Swaggin> nightmare moon wasnt an actual pony though
<Rainbow_Swaggin> it was like an altered state of mind of lunas
<SpadeMagnes[School> She was still destroyed though
<Alchemist> SpadeMagnes[School: isnt Nightmare moon luna?
<Meanwhile> Hi everybody.
<MadSurge> Hello Meanwhile :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> heya Meanwhile :)
<XAX> Sap mean
<AttackWithHugs> Hi Meanwhile
<XAX> Meanwhile:
<Alchemist> And Im sure being turned to stone is considered to be lethal (aka doscord)
<Invi> hi Meanwhile
<thelonepony> Hi Meanwhile :)
<Rainbow_Swaggin> i feel like nightmare moon is going to come back though
<Rainbow_Swaggin> perhaps as a final showdown of s3
<SpadeMagnes[School> Shizuka: Next time you do GTA4 try to find a way to turn off car friction
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Holla! :)
<SpadeMagnes[School> Shit will be so cash
<Rainbow_Swaggin> perhaps thats what the book was for luna was holding at the end of ep2

<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: of course not
<AttackWithHugs> All these updates
<thelonepony> SuperBrony64 X Nintenod OTP :3
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: whoever says BO2 is the best game ever is fuckign wrong
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O3O
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Best disguise.
<thelonepony> ninteno*
<Rainbow_Swaggin> bo2 is probably shit
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Black Ops II is the best game ever...and I haven't even played it yet :D
<Rainbow_Swaggin> im not buying it
<thelonepony> cant spell for shit today =w=
<XAX> SuperBrony64: o u
<Shizuka> 13SpadeMagnes[School: it's a config file somewher
<SpadeMagnes[School> The fact my dad saw people camping outside gamestop for BO2 at midnight dissapoints me
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: I wanna see her dress up as each mane 6 :D even herself
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Bronysith: i guess but its just irritating seeing so many people still hate it despite looking past stuff like Dante's new look and what not and not look at the improvement in gameplay,ya know?
<Meanwhile> BO2? You mean Call of Modern Greyfare 902?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> *despite NOT looking
<Bronysith> oh i meant borderlands 2 :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01SpadeMagnes[School: That's the power of brand loyalty.
<XAX> SpadeMagnes[School: Lol, console casuals. Get it on steam and you just stay up till midnight on your computer.
<Alchemist> BTW what the f*ck was up with Fluttershy when she almost bitchslapped a crystal pony? that was so out of place.
<Rainbow_Swaggin> what do you take marketing or something
<SpadeMagnes[School> But you know people Sketch_Toku_Brony ! We have to bitch about shit we dont even play!
<XAX> Alchemist: That was a little odd.
<SpadeMagnes[School> God forbid we play a fucking game before we say its shit....
<Bronysith> Dart is a manly man
<MadSurge> Alchemist: I guess she can't get angry at them
<Rainbow_Swaggin> frankly RD was becoming more universally likable by s2 end yet in this opening, she went back to being uhh... tougher?
<Meanwhile> I'd say it's fair to judge a game in a series if the past several games in the series have been pretty much the same.
<Bronysith> ^
<Alchemist> Rainbow_Swaggin: not tougher, just meaner.
<MadSurge> The hell you mean, RD has always been like that
<SpadeMagnes[School> Not really...
<Rainbow_Swaggin> meanwhile, what about star wars
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SpadeMagnes[School: yeah your right -_-'
<Meanwhile> you're*
<Bronysith> Rainbow_Swaggin: those games are usually different each time
<GilDash> Perhaps, but (yes, even I doubt it) a game does have the potential to be quite different from its predecessors.
<Rainbow_Swaggin> brony, i meant the movies
<Rainbow_Swaggin> the first 3 were great then the new ones ruined it comparitively
<Bronysith> Rainbow_Swaggin: he was talking about games, numbnuts
<AttackWithHugs> Woop, time to download a soundtrack.
<SpadeMagnes[School> Then there are people who bitch about when games dont do anything different and then bitch some more when they try something new
<Invi> when did that air? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A4-aicXxaI&feature=g-vrec
<Rainbow_Swaggin> what the hay, thats just uncalled for
<Alchemist> MadSurge: I get she is more tolerant, but why would she even raise her arm? Even the ones with a shorter fuse were not that annoyed at the crystal ponies when they didnt remember anything.
<Rainbow_Swaggin> i lold when fluttershy stepped in her own costume
<Rainbow_Swaggin> that caught me off guard so much
<Vivix> ^^
<SpadeMagnes[School> Fucking Blue Shells....
<MadSurge> Alchemist: at least it was just that one slip up
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' everyone :)
<Invi> hi AdamTheDuck
<AttackWithHugs> Hi AdamTheDuck
<AttackWithHugs> Again
<MLP_Brovakiin> Morning AdamTheDuck :)
<thelonepony> Hi AdamTheDuck :3
<MadSurge> Ohai AdamTheDuck!
<Rainbow_Swaggin> so did anyone notice the book luna held at the end?
<Meanwhile> 'Lo AdamTheDuck.
*thelonepony noms on AdamTheDuck :3
<Alchemist> MadSurge: dont get me wrong, Im not nitpicking, it was just odd.
<alexxm> how've you been AdamTheDuck
<GilDash> I would ask where Pinkie gets all those costumes, but of course: She stashes them in case of emergencies.
<MadSurge> Rainbow_Swaggin: everyone did :D
<BladedWings> hi AdamTheDuck
<GilDash> AdamTheDuck: Holla! :)
<Meanwhile> GilDash: In previously undiscovered empires? Actually yeah probably.
<SpadeMagnes[School> aeiou
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm, I've been just fine thank you, you? :)
<Rainbow_Swaggin> i want to think theyre going to try and take over twis mind and make her do something horrible, and have her overcome their controls, perhaps becoming next in line for the throne
<GilDash> Meanwhile: This *is* Pinkie we're talking about. Overestimation is impossible.
<alexxm> i've been better AdamTheDuck
<Rainbow_Swaggin> how even would alicorns be made?
<Vivix> Intercourse
<SpadeMagnes[School> >Have over 600 pokemon to catch
<SpadeMagnes[School> >only use 6
<Meanwhile> Raving furious intercourse.
<Vivix> Hehe
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<AdamTheDuck> XD
<Vivix> no I really really am excited for this season because of the premiere, but the whole premiere felt like it wa setting things up
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Meanwhile: 0_o :D
<thelonepony> :D
<Rainbow_Swaggin> oh god, the clopping begins
<Vivix> the book- their conversation, I like it
<aniderp> ok now im gonna play pokemo white 2
<Meanwhile> Batclop Begins.
<SpadeMagnes[School> Do I even want to fucking know who Celestia did to end up with Blueblood?
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<aniderp> pokemon*
<Rainbow_Swaggin> really my only problem was sombra not getting any backstory
<Vivix> Batman x Robin OTP
<GilDash> Who said anything about clopping? Intercourse implies a partner.
<thelonepony> Hi Everlasting_Joy :)
<Meanwhile> Batclop, The Dark Knight Rises (If you know what I mean.)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy thelonepony!
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: just for you
<thelonepony> :D
<Meanwhile> 'Lo Everlasting_Joy.
<Vivix> Rainbow_Swaggin, yeah, but I feel he wasn't the focus- you know? LIke not a real Villain, but you never know, he might return with backstory
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Everlasting_Joy
<Rainbow_Swaggin> like even if he just hated noone paying attention to him, that would have been enough to make a somewhat beleivable villan
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Meanwhile and AdamTheDuck!
<MadSurge> Rainbow_Swaggin: we could get more backstory as the season goes on
*Bronysith glomps Everlasting_Joy
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Everlasting_Joy :)
*Everlasting_Joy is glomped "Howdy Bronysith!"
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy MLP_Brovakiin!
<Vivix> I watched it a few more times and I think he might return- or just be the tip, it felt like it was introducing him, rather than--using him
<BladedWings> hi Everlasting_Joy
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey BladedWings!
<MadSurge> Vivix: Ikr
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> well im gonna play some DMC 3,cya in abit :) Keepin' it SSStylish!
<MadSurge> Sketch_Toku_Brony: :D later
<Rainbow_Swaggin> sombras door, id be tempted to peer into it to know what im most afraid of
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye Sketch_Toku_Brony :D
*SpadeMagnes[School attaches rockets to the shizubus
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Sketch_Toku_Brony
<thelonepony> Bye Sketch_Toku_Brony :D
<Michael> hai everypony :)
<Rainbow_Swaggin> bye sketch

<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Michael :)
<BladedWings> bye sketch and hi Michael
<alexxm> how are things Michael
<Rainbow_Swaggin> also, im new so i have to ask, does everyone here know eachother?
<alexxm> bye Sketch_Toku_Brony
*Michael hugs thelonepony MLP_Brovakiin BladedWings alexxm
<GilDash> Yeah, Sombra seemed unecessarily pointless. You could literally have removed him and the dark, shadow crystals advancing on their own would have probably been far scarier.
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs Michael back :3
<Michael> alexxm: notbad.jpg, and you?
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Michael
<thelonepony> Rainbow_Swaggin: go read the rules and FAQ
*Michael hugs AdamTheDuck
*thelonepony noms on Michael :3
<SpadeMagnes[School> 2+2=toast
*AdamTheDuck slowly places a muffin on Michael
<alexxm> i've been better Michael
*Michael is nomed :3
<Meanwhile> GilDash: But crystals don't go "GRAAAAH" every so often.
<thelonepony> :3
<BladedWings> Rainbow_Swaggin: i know one person here personally but i've seen the ovther names before...i just like being nice to everyone who comes in ^_^
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Michael!
<Shizuka> 13hm...
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13carmageddon is more involved than i thought
*Michael hugs Everlasting_Joy
*Everlasting_Joy hugs Michael :).
<SpadeMagnes[School> Carmageddon is awesome
<SpadeMagnes[School> So much chaos
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> Random Shizu is Best Shizu. ^^
<BladedWings> so many cars
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Yeah, 'cause "Graaaah" was really scary. Hell, the crystals could have had some telepathic link that did that itself, as well as brainwash the crystal ponies.
<SpadeMagnes[School> Lets go bowling
<AttackWithHugs> Wait, is there a stream?
<Biggestpinkiefan> lol
<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> How you doing Shizu? Oh I had a question as well. Do you mind if I pm?
<Meanwhile> GilDash: But...but...GRAAAAH.
<Everlasting_Joy> AttackWithHugs: I don't think so.
<BladedWings> AttackWithHugs: if there is i didnt know of it :D
<Biggestpinkiefan> someone tell me how to upload a video to stream?
<AdamTheDuck> AttackWithHugs, not that I'm aware of
<AttackWithHugs> Okaay
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Graaah to you too. :p
<SpadeMagnes[School> So is Discord the only villian to cause their own downfall?
<AdamTheDuck> Biggestpinkiefan, you must first learn the art of mooing.
<Rainbow_Swaggin> eyyup
<AwsomeNick> No stream?
<alexxm> SpadeMagnes|School seems so
<Meanwhile> GilDash: Sombra was probably too busy ordering his g.ak.
<AdamTheDuck> Biggestpinkiefan, then you have the power to stream.
*Biggestpinkiefan MOOOOOO....
<Biggestpinkiefan> MOOOO!
<SpadeMagnes[School> Bawk
<Rainbow_Swaggin> i dont know what g ak is
<kidzrul732> hey bronies it's still my birthday
<Michael> Moo ^o^
*alexxm moons Biggestpinkiefan
<Everlasting_Joy> AdamTheDuck: You're evil :D.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Happy birthday kidzrul732 :)
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Oh, *that's* what he was saying! He went through all that trouble just to get some Gak? Talk about killer miscommunication!
<AdamTheDuck> Happy brithday kidzrul732
<BladedWings> happy birthday kidzrul732
<Meanwhile> Rainbow_Swaggin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nogPSLCHvOA
<GilDash> Bollocks.
<Everlasting_Joy> Is someone bring up Gak?! Please shoot me!
<Michael> ohai kidzrul732 and happy birthday!
<thelonepony> Happy birthday kidzrul732 :)
<AdamTheDuck> Moooooooo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDvvPYsTXm0
<kidzrul732> hey by the way, if there is any g-word commercials during livestream, will they be censored?
<AttackWithHugs> Happy birthday kidzrul732
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh I see, g.a.k is a bannable word.
*Michael gives a birthday giant muffin to kidzrul732
<Shizuka> 13not bannable
<Meanwhile> They should just include G.ak in the actual show like G4 Smooze.
<Shizuka> 13just autokick
<AttackWithHugs> kidzrul732, that would be hilarious when there's a mass kick wall if the commercial shows up
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: Oh, yeah, you're right.
<Saturn> 08,01y''know, i would love to be joined with a tok'ra symbiote
<Rainbow_Swaggin> well thats stupoid
<SpadeMagnes[School> Hey look its a football!
<Rainbow_Swaggin> i chisled it!
<AttackWithHugs> It's a stone, SpadeMagnes[School.
<Alchemist> Saturn: sounds painful
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: probably, iniially
<SpadeMagnes[School> It chisled it! Its offcial size!
<SpadeMagnes[School> *I
<Rainbow_Swaggin> catch the football
<Michael> wat
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> terrible. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7JYnR5smYM
<Rainbow_Swaggin> its a super mario super show thing
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[School: It's a stone, you didn't make it.
<Meanwhile> Mama luigi.
<kidzrul732> but if the commercial for the substance that shall not be named happens during my little pony episode livestream, will they be censored?
<Rainbow_Swaggin> toasters toast toast
<SpadeMagnes[School> Rope?
<Rainbow_Swaggin> its in the instruction manual
<Meanwhile> Toasters toast bread.
<AttackWithHugs> SpadeMagnes[School: *turns around* NO
<Meanwhile> If you toast toast you're going to end up with incredibly crisp toast.
<BladedWings> kidzrul732: probably not
<Rainbow_Swaggin> i love super toast
<SpadeMagnes[School> So what tge fuck was bowser doing with that shitload of toasters?
<AttackWithHugs> Oh jeezus, suddenly Skype is catching up on my phone
<Rainbow_Swaggin> he didnt have a toaster repairpony to help
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I like it slightly charred though. Just before it goes black, when it's a nice deep brown is best.
<BladedWings> AttackWithHugs: what u mean?
<Meanwhile> GilDash: I don't even like toast.
<alexxm> SpadeMagnes|School he planned to destroy the world
<SpadeMagnes[School> POWDERED...TOAST...MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
<GilDash> That said, I do stick bread in the toaster, not toast. XD
<AttackWithHugs> BladedWings, did a factory reset on my phone and just redownloaded Skype
<BladedWings> aaah
<Rainbow_Swaggin> thats my sword maaaaan what do they want with my sword?

<TwilightSparks> How Long Did you guys wait for the stream???

<Barb|MyLilPseudonym> You would have to calm me down, and explain that it always happens
<BladedWings> TwilightSparks: forEVEEEER

<VenHur> WHY YOU NO GIVE HER DAT?!
<MLP_Brovakiin> :D

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I was being sarcastic.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> theres no way I would know people with such generic names.
<Meanwhile> Damnit bus.
