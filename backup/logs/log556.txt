<PonyNegZero> roll your way to victory~
<Dark_Horst> the yellow ones
<Meanwhile> Huzzah!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> The fighter was my second guess
<sergio_scriptor> Dark_Horst: i think they look both similar
<Meanwhile> Unicycle to the finish.
<Phase4> 00,02didnt actually expect that to take off
<PonyNegZero> physics sees Phase4 rollin', it hatin' (but PP don't give a buck)
<brony_swan> seya guys in a bit
<OmegaMetroidBrony> bai brony_swan
<sergio_scriptor> bye for now brony_swan
<Quick_Thinker> um hey sergio im not gonna play ZPS im gonna be busy re writing my fic
<Meanwhile> Bye brony_swan
<MegaMoonShine> Later everyone, I am gonna go get some lunch
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: no worrys mate,i lost the will to play too :)
<Quick_Thinker> this fic is a mess and i think it needs to be thought out more
<Meanwhile> Bye MegaMoonShine.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> What would AJ, FS, and RD do with Physics?
<sergio_scriptor> bye for now MegaMoonShine
<Meanwhile> sergio_scriptor: worries*
<Quick_Thinker> as well as changed entirely
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bai MegaMoonShine
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: well good luck writing it then :)
<Meanwhile> That looks like some kind of cargo dropship.
<Ponies47> Bye MegaMoonShine
<Quick_Thinker> yep in fact chapter 1 is gone now
<Meanwhile> Bamf.
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: no drag/friction/etc for RD
*Ponies47 Is gonna play some TF2
<PonyNegZero> backflip
<Quick_Thinker> its still on fanfic i cant delete that one easily
<PonyNegZero> backflip x8
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Racing physics
<Quick_Thinker> however the FIMfic on is gone
<Phase4> 00,02and then everyone lived
<Phase4> 00,02the end
<Meanwhile> I like how it wouldn't take off slowly but instead went straight into "Do a flip" mode.
<sergio_scriptor> Quick_Thinker: well i cant wait to read the pre-version and the after version
<sergio_scriptor> THAT looks BADASS
<Meanwhile> Well that went well.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O_O
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: AJ would probably make days like 30 hours long for extra working time...
<Meanwhile> Deploy parachute AFTER flight. AFTER. Not before.
<Quick_Thinker> i might even send the beta read to some of you guys to gvie sugestions
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Or not change anything and keep it Twilight Standards
<sergio_scriptor> Phase4: you want to explainus what was that :P
<OmegaMetroidBrony> But who knows, she's stubborn as a mule
<sergio_scriptor> *explain us
<Meanwhile> It tripped on a rock.
<PonyNegZero> extra long runway...
<Phase4> 00,02it go boom
<Phase4> 00,02big bada boom
<Meanwhile> That thing is too fat to take off.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> FlutterPhysics would make everything soft, serene and not very frightning/surprising
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: and she'd slow down time a tad
<MisterFoster> because she is made of dark matter
<PonyNegZero> Phase4: burn all of the grass
<Meanwhile> Well, it's in the air.
<Meanwhile> That's progress.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Inquery on why time would be slowed slightly
<sergio_scriptor> Meanwhile: it's the sound of progress
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :) How are we all today?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Moin Sylandest
<Meanwhile> Pfft, the snap on the parachute broke half the wing off.
<Sylandest> morning, OmegaMetroidBrony :)
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: sudden actions and stuff wouldn't be as sudden
<sergio_scriptor> Hi Sylandest ,fairly good,we are watching Phase4 impossible machines shows
<Meanwhile> Allo Sylandest.
<CrazyCherry> Morning Sylandest.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Ah
<PonyNegZero> 'splosion with no death...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I was thinking along the lines of AJ time extension not matrix like
<MisterFoster> seems legit...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :P
<seatsea> Sylandest: good afternoon (from where i live)
*Sylandest hugs CrazyCherry, Meanwhile, sergio_scriptor, seatsea
*CrazyCherry hugs Sylandest
<Sylandest> sergio_scriptor: so i can see, lol
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I'd bet Derpy would be God Tier at Physics
<OmegaMetroidBrony> or at least Demigod
*seatsea hugs Sylandest
*CrazyCherry kisses Sylandest on the cheek.
<Meanwhile> Dat stumble.
*Sylandest kisses CrazyCherry back on the cheek :)
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: she's immune to all other physics... she does what she wants.
<Meanwhile> Pfft, what happened there?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Can't argue with that
<OmegaMetroidBrony> -.O
<seatsea> having a wiered problem with my browser frezzing going to reboot my pc
<Meanwhile> Bamf.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It's an exploding fish!
<sergio_scriptor> seatsea: i had that problem to early in the morning actualy
<sergio_scriptor> *too
<Meanwhile> And again, the wings just fall off.
<PonyNegZero> someone give me a song to listen to on loop for an hour or so...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Derpy's Great Muffin Adventure
<PonyNegZero> I guess I'll be getting rickrolled for the next hour or so...
<sergio_scriptor> PonyNegZero: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZcmTl_1ER8
<PonyNegZero> well played Meanwhile...
<Meanwhile> You're welcome.
<Meanwhile> sergio_scriptor: No non image links during stream.
<Quick_Thinker> well shit man is it hard to write stories if you have Aspurgers XD
<sergio_scriptor> Meanwhile: PonyNegZero we asked for it :|
<Meanwhile> sergio_scriptor: So?
<PonyNegZero> sergio_scriptor: give me, not post in channel
<OmegaMetroidBrony> All it needs is a yellow coat of paint and the Beatles
<sergio_scriptor> Meanwhile: so i should shut up ?
<Sallymeow1> hiya guys :'(
<Meanwhile> sergio_scriptor: Mhmm.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Kewl boat
<Meanwhile> Allo Sallymeow1. Why so cryface?
<PonyNegZero> sergio_scriptor: when I wrote "give me", that is a cue for a pm...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Whats wrong Sallymeow1?
<sergio_scriptor> hi Sallymeow1
<sagas> glitch?
<Sallymeow1> my TV provider is getting rid of viacom channels!
<Meanwhile> Oh cool, it works as a boat.
<sergio_scriptor> PonyNegZero: :| my bad
<Sallymeow1> thats 26 channels!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.o
<PonyNegZero> sergio_scriptor: not a problem
<PonyNegZero> Phase4 smash!
*Meanwhile never watches TV and can't really sympathise.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I'm guessing that includes The Hub
<Quick_Thinker> eh its not that bad for you Sally my cabler provider took away the HUB THE BASTARDS
<Sallymeow1> possibly
<sagas> When did kerbas get boats? with rocket thrusters
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O_O
<Meanwhile> sagas: Since the wings broke off.
<Phase4> 00,02screw physics, i'ma boat plane
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :F Dat boat plane :F
<Sylandest> whats that sound?
<Meanwhile> Phase4 is Pinkie Pie.
<Phase4> 00,02Sylandest, bugs
<sergio_scriptor> sagas: at about 1290 during the great kerbal water revolution i think,they wore lead by wiliam kermin that discovered the only rive in the planet
<Phase4> 00,02many bugs
<Sylandest> Phase4: ....you're obliterating them! XD
<Alpha-Omega> uhhh my body decided to wake me up after only 3 hours of sleep
<Sallymeow1> and guess when it changes?
<sagas> sergio_scriptor: a brave kerbal indeed
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Meanwhile, Pinkie is running the Physics Department. Twilight's asleep.
<Sallymeow1> tonight at 12:01 AM :'(
<sagas> vroom vroom vroom!
<Quick_Thinker> the hay explosion and then a sudden burst of speed
<Quick_Thinker> um your gonna run out of land sooner or later
<Sallymeow1> well this came is cool
<Sallymeow1> WOAH
<Meanwhile> Best parachutes ever.
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<Alpha-Omega> phase you still awake?
<Quick_Thinker> no way
<sergio_scriptor> still alive
<Meanwhile> And yet somehow they survived.
<Sallymeow1> he died
<Phase4> 00,02Alpha-Omega, going to bed soon
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Obviously they had enought minerals to buy the armor upgrade on the capsule
<Alpha-Omega> Alright good you were awake all night
<sergio_scriptor> the wing is flying away :D
<Meanwhile> Wing fragment doesn't care.
<sagas> its a UFO!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<Meanwhile> Hahahaha
<sagas> :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Aliens Everywhere!
<PonyNegZero> magnets!
<Sallymeow1> I gtg enjoy the viacom channels
<sergio_scriptor> i like how the wing lands so softly and then explodes
<Sallymeow1> see ya
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bai Sallymeow1
<sergio_scriptor> bye Sallymeow1
<Meanwhile> Seeya Sallymeow1.
<Sallymeow1> have a great day :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You too
<Alpha-Omega> Nooooo phase nooooo
<Sallymeow1> Im sure I wont
<sergio_scriptor> :'(
<Meanwhile> Is it me or do the explosions look kinda like spiders?
<sergio_scriptor> Meanwhile: a little bit
<Alpha-Omega> Next time I go to bed I will not listen to music
<XAX> Meanwhile: wut.
<PonyNegZero> Alpha-Omega: I still have 50 minutes to go before I can turn off this rickroll...
<RainbowDerp> ....
<sergio_scriptor> a carrousel rocket ? lol ? :P
<Alpha-Omega> rickroll?
<Meanwhile> Welp.
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<Meanwhile> And landing.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> now it's a shroom
<OmegaMetroidBrony> of death
<sergio_scriptor> that...was...AWESOME
<PonyNegZero> I love the smell of dead kerbal in the morning
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol
<sagas> looks like a space station
<PonyNegZero> and root beer since our coffee machine is missing...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> It kinda looks like R.O.B.
<Meanwhile> This can only end in tears.
<sagas> So what the point in making it spin besides just fun?
<sergio_scriptor> it reminds me of a carrousel
<Meanwhile> sagas: That's all the point you need! :D
<sergio_scriptor> lol
<sagas> :D
<sagas> It just ripped off
<Meanwhile> Rocket has no time for you, it wants to see the world!
<PonyNegZero> sagas: technically, it will go straighter because of gyroscopic effects...
<Alpha-Omega> Detached too early
<Meanwhile> Follow your dreams rocket!
<sergio_scriptor> it's still going
<sergio_scriptor> there it goes
<sagas> PonyNegZero: Yes, but I dont think this game takes that in effect
<Meanwhile> It followed it's dreams into the ground. :/
<PonyNegZero> sagas: not according to Pinkie Pie it doesn't
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Shame it had to end that way
<Alpha-Omega> does anyone else think the kerbals look creepy?
<Meanwhile> Yes.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I thought they were monkeys at first
<sergio_scriptor> Alpha-Omega: i think they look a little bit cute
<PonyNegZero> Alpha-Omega: I like them
<sagas> PonyNegZero: Gotta love artificial physics
<PonyNegZero> and some kerbals just want to see the world burn... deal with it...
<sagas> dat background
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O.O
<Meanwhile> Smoooooooze
<sagas> SMOOZE!
<sergio_scriptor> OmegaMetroidBrony: the first time i saw them i thought they wore fish :P
<OmegaMetroidBrony> bow bow bow bow bow bow bow bow

<Meanwhile> Famous on interweb.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nor do I really follow anything or anyone
<Quick_Thinker> i want to skip this ad buts it a tobuscus and i dont think i will ever see it again
<sergio_scriptor> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: he was already said in a vlog that he suports the fandom,but he is not a fan of the show,says it looks good,but not a die hard fan
<FairysHuff> I'm bored. What could I watch while eating foods.
<Meanwhile> Your food.
<PonyNegZero> Meanwhile: well played
<Alpha-Omega> the food channel
<Meanwhile> Watch that video of Bear Grylls eating a maggot.
<FairysHuff> *Ignores stupid comments*
<sergio_scriptor> Saturn: cant you like stream something ? and if you cant ,can you tell us who is going to be the next person to stream ?
<Quick_Thinker> and now the ad is done and i will never see it again porbely and now i can watch pewdipie :D
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: any shows you've been meaning to catch up on?
<FairysHuff> Sylandest Sadly there aren't any. ~_~
<PonyNegZero> The next streamer will stream when he/she feels like it, nobody knows...
<Quick_Thinker> also does any pony want to beta read my fic of MLP FIM crossed with Day Z
<Meanwhile> FairysHuff: Cartoons?
<FairysHuff> Sylandest I would catch up on my anime but I don't feel like anime today
<Saturn> 08,01sergio_scriptor: i can't; i'm at work
<sergio_scriptor> PonyNegZero: :'( yep
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: aww...*huggles* well, why dont we find a show you might be interested in?
<Saturn> 08,01as to the next person to stream, the official roster says "N/A"
<Saturn> 08,01so you'll have to do without for now, i'm afraid
<Saturn> 08,01go read a book or somethign
<FairysHuff> Sylandest Sure, but where to start?
<sergio_scriptor> Saturn: AWWW,well thanks anyway
<PonyNegZero> Who wants to do my work for me and not get payed!
<Meanwhile> You.

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Bai sergio_scriptor
*PonyNegZero nuzzles Saturn
<Sylandest> laters, sergio_scriptor
<MegaMoonShine> Bye sergio_scriptor :)
<FairysHuff> Sylandest I liked Babylon 5 and the Stargate series but there are no new shows that have space sci-fi to them. Maybe I should just rewatch those >_>
<Meanwhile> Seeya sergio_scriptor
<sergio_scriptor> bye guys,dont let the slenderman catch you :)
<Alpha-Omega> ahhh music
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> sergio_scriptor: mmmhmmm
<AttacktheAndalite> bye serg--gone
<Alpha-Omega> I'll buck up slenderman with a coffee pot
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: perhaps...have you ever considered watching Doctor Who? It's somewhat along the same lines, but very good, in my opinion
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Fuck....
<FairysHuff> Sylandest I'll consider it.
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: There's also the ever enjoyable Star Trek series' to consider :) But its up to you
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Watching that play through of Slender...
<FairysHuff> Sylandest Seen them all ^_^
<Alpha-Omega> fine
<Alpha-Omega> I'm playing slender
<OmegaMetroidBrony> FUCK!
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: hehehe, me too. They're always good for a replay through though! So there's that! :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Fucking jumped!
<FairysHuff> Sylandest True.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> OmegaMetroidBrony: :3
<OmegaMetroidBrony> That bastard!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> But yeah Its electric
<FairysHuff> Sylandest I shall think of something, if nothing else I suppose I could just watch more Kikoskia lets plays.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ME GUSTA
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: sounds like a plan. We won't let you get bored, hehe :D
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I would recommend this to a friend of mine...
<FairysHuff> Sylandest ^_^
<OmegaMetroidBrony> He already has SCP-087
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i cant tell which is more scary, SCP or Slender
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Some of the SCP's are pretty creepy
<MegaMoonShine> What's SCP?
<XAX> I must look more into this SCP thing.
<XAX> what MegaMoonShine said.
<AttacktheAndalite> Oh, we're talking about SCP now? Which ones?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Humorous SCP link
<OmegaMetroidBrony> http://www.scp-wiki.net/10-30-a-m
<Meanwhile> I like the SCP's, they're neat.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm
<OmegaMetroidBrony> All about the new guys
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I'd like to thank alexxm for those SCP links
<MegaMoonShine> Dafuq did I just read?
<AttacktheAndalite> OmegaMetroidBrony: I wanna punch a shart
<AttacktheAndalite> shark*
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Good
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Because you will punch sharks, think about punching sharks, research punching sharks, dream about punching sharks
<XAX> OmegaMetroidBrony: Am I meant to be freaked out? Im laughing my ass off here...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> No
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You're supposed to laugh
<XAX> Good.
<XAX> It's working.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I did say humorous SCP link
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Slender, still scarey with one headphone
<Alpha-Omega> I wanted him to come at me
<AttacktheAndalite> I dare one of you guys to test SCP-288
<Alpha-Omega> he didn't so I got bored
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Shit...
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I think I know which one that is but....
<AttacktheAndalite> http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-288
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SCP - Slender Containment Protocol
<AttacktheAndalite> Have fun.
<FairysHuff> Sylandest I decided on DrWho. I haven't watched that since I was a child ^_^
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: ee! Good choice! What series are you going to watch? :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I read that one ages ago
<Rainbow> Hello?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Rainbow

<FairysHuff> AND I NEED TO PEE BUT SOMEONE IS IN THE SHOWER! OH GOD THE PAIN! O_o
<Rainbow> Oh i was gonna say 34
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: good pick! Its a good place to start. When you reach the tenth Doctor, you'll be caught up with me, hehe. David Tennant ftw
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: hold it! Hold it for dear life!
<Rainbow> Whuts Streaming?
<Rainbow> Mines still buffering.
<MegaMoonShine> Rainbow: The ring
*FairysHuff Makes painful looking strained faces.
<FairysHuff> ^_^
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Buffer circle
<Sylandest> Rainbow: nothing at the moment. No scheduled streamer. Tis a dead period
<Rainbow> Aw..
<PonyNegZero> I need to keep working on just under 7 hours of sleep... my clan match last night took way too long (opponents complained about lag on our server...)
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: is there a second restroom in the house?
<Rainbow> MY FAVORITE SHOW
<FairysHuff> Sylandest Nope.
<alexxm> hey guys
<FairysHuff> Sylandest Unless you count the kitchen sink. ^_^
<Rainbow> We now return to "The buffer circle".
<Rainbow> :P
<FairysHuff> Maybe I should invest in a chamber pot for times like this O_o
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: ...bugger. No, i dont count the kitchen sink :D But you gotta watch holding it too long
<PonyNegZero> third tree on the left
<Rainbow> How do you do that BOLD name thing with the notifaction?
<alexxm> hey guys
<Rainbow> Hey!
*PonyNegZero pokes Rainbow.
<FairysHuff> Sylandest Shower just stopped, guessing another 20 minutes before bathroom is free.
<alexxm> hey Rainbow how have you been
<Rainbow> Good.
*FairysHuff starts looking online for chamber pots.
<Rainbow> Bored. But good.
<Sylandest> FairysHuff: tell them to hurry the buck up! :D
<Rainbow> Lol.
<PonyNegZero> just barge in, nobody will care
<PonyNegZero> pony_7007: nice dubs

<Barbetos|Atwork> Yeah alexxm
<StinkomanFan> I mean, IGN liked an INDY GAME!

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Damn my lack of sleep... it's making me imagine spiders out of the corner of my eye
*OmegaMetroidBrony isn't one for spiders
<PonyNegZero> Ha, I just signed for a package for my workplace - I feel so empowered!

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Because I'll end up staying up all night
<Alpha-Omega> don't wory scary games get too redundant
<Alpha-Omega> If you beat one you beat them all
<StinkomanFan> OmegaMetroidBrony, just repeat there's no such thing as Slendy
<Rainbow> Wait how does that work.
<PonyNegZero> OmegaMetroidBrony: don't die, dying is bad
<StinkomanFan> over and over again
<Rainbow> I defenatly not playing that game..
<Rainbow> Now.

<StinkomanFan> not scary
<Alpha-Omega> Dead space 3 looks like lost planet
<OmegaMetroidBrony> lol
<Rainbow> Lol.
<alexxm> dead space relays to much on jump scares
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ^
<Barbetos|Atwork> Survival horror will now be known as survival action, unless it is indie survival horror.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Though they still get me
<Alpha-Omega> Don't forget the soundtrack
<XAX> I quote from Dead Space 2, "Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in your eye."

<XAX> sage
<PonyNegZero> Ponies.
<StinkomanFan> Yes, that word is challenging
<sprinkle_GS17> Pwnies
<RADISH> What does it stream here apart form movies
<PonyNegZero> little bit of everything
<sprinkle_GS17> RADISH: no specific times, but pretty often
<sprinkle_GS17> oh, what
<sprinkle_GS17> everything them
<sprinkle_GS17> my typos killed the chat...
<PonyNegZero> pony_139488: nice dubs.
<pony_139488> Hello?
<sprinkle_GS17> hi pony_139488
<pony_139488> How do i tell my mom I'm a brony?
<brony_swan> gunna go play a game er sumthin' later bros
<Everlasting_Joy> pony_139488: Listen to this guys (getting the link).
<sprinkle_GS17> i g2g, bye
<brony_swan> seya sprinkle_GS17
<Barbetos|Atwork> See ya sprinkle_GS17
<PonyNegZero> pony_139488: don't hide it, nothing is wrong - just continue doing whatever you're doing
<Everlasting_Joy> pony_139488: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-CkRtPZMZ8
<StinkomanFan> So... Slenderman
<pony_139488> Ok, but there's a problem.
<StinkomanFan> How do we know he's really a man?
<pony_139488> Since MLP is considered to be gay to anyone but someone who cares about it, she might be offended, because as always, anybody thinks MLP is for little girls, but a brony.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm
<pony_139488> I already sent a message to all my friend last night that I'm a brony, and some people reacted with surprise, and some hat, none yet from other bronys.
<MadSurge> I stopped caring about what they think of me a long time ago. Besides, internet friends all consider me a nice guy :D
<pony_139488> *Hate
<RADISH> I enjoy every show pritty much
<StinkomanFan> Show them ponies, if they don't like it. Live and let live
<RADISH> Sept that only way is essex
<RADISH> probably would like it
<RADISH> just dont want to support them
<PonyNegZero> pony_139488: not the best move, you don't need to "come out"
<pony_139488> I appreciate otherponies actually answering my question.
<PonyNegZero> pony_139488: just be yourself and pretend like they knew about it all along
<Liokin> Rain: Herrroooo?
<MadSurge> Feel the ground and bring it out casually only if you're discussing other cartoons/similar topics, or asked directly
<Fisheh_Fish> Fuck me
<Fisheh_Fish> In for a slow day
<MadSurge> That's how I do it, and people still don't want me dead :D
<RADISH> I was reading a my little pony book on the school bus today
<RADISH> no one cared
<MadSurge> ^
<RADISH> was shit though
<pony_139488> Swag.
<PonyNegZero> MadSurge: my parents asked after I started wearing tshirts and whatnot... I wear a brony wristband everywhere...
<pony_139488> Swag all the same.
<RADISH> Im sorry tv show books
<StinkomanFan> See, nopony really CARES if you're a brony or not
<Alpha-Omega> They have interactive books in the app store
<StinkomanFan> And if they don't like it they're just saying it to be assholes
<Alpha-Omega> Mostly aimed at children thogh
<pony_139488> Yeah, I saw that after I talked to my friend about it, he was pretty casual.
<Alpha-Omega> though
<MadSurge> PonyNegZero: my mom yells at me for still watching cartoons, but only when she's already cranky/furious at something else. My parents don't really care what I do as long as I don't get into trouble :D
<Alpha-Omega> Just finished reading a fanfic about chrysalis
<RADISH> yeah alpha it was that book
<RADISH> Stuff
<PonyNegZero> MadSurge: kinda the same story here
<PonyNegZero> but then again, I am a severe case of "0 bucks given" when I was in high school...
<Alpha-Omega> I want some of the toys but they never look as good as the cartoons
<MadSurge> PonyNegZero: If I bring up that it was made by the Powerpuff Girls/Foster's Home creator they will understand :D
<PonyNegZero> The hair just doesn't quite sit right with me
<PonyNegZero> MadSurge: Oh, all of my friends are totally cool with it (all that have noticed it...)
<pony_139488> And that the MLP producers encourage more men audiences.
<Alpha-Omega> I wish they had bracelets of all MLP characters
<PonyNegZero> Alpha-Omega: if they don't exist, make them yourself
<StinkomanFan> I need to find a way to make my mother make something pony related
<Fisheh_Fish> Hey guys
<StinkomanFan> ...Maybe a soap statue?
<MadSurge> PonyNegZero: also my only pony related shirts are from Shed. mov and Magic.mov, the ones with toaster-cozy Derpy and R-DASH 5000 :D
<PonyNegZero> I wear this: http://derpy.me/rdOw7 everywhere
<alexxm> hey Fisheh_Fish hows your day been
<Fisheh_Fish> Eh, it's just started
<Fisheh_Fish> Great breakfast though
<PonyNegZero> I have 3 tshirts, 2 belts, a wristband and a lanyard
<alexxm> ok Fisheh_Fish did you sleep well then
<Fisheh_Fish> Definitely
<Alpha-Omega> I just need to learn how to make them
<Fisheh_Fish> How'd you sleep?
<PonyNegZero> I started an embroidery, but I accidently made it mirrored what it should have been... so I need to restart that
<alexxm> its afternoon hwew Fisheh_Fish
<PonyNegZero> (and RD still stands on top of my right work monitor)
<Fisheh_Fish> oh
<Fisheh_Fish> I'm on Central Standard Time
<StinkomanFan> You think a giant soap pony would sell to internets people?
<Fisheh_Fish> Maybe
<Fisheh_Fish> Sounds legit
<PonyNegZero> StinkomanFan: that might be a hard sell...
<spitfirecolt2> i would buy it just cause i buy everything mlp
<Alpha-Omega> man the derpy plush toys go hard on ebay
<StinkomanFan> PonyNegZero, hey when all you have is a hammer
<spitfirecolt2> yes they do
<Meanwhile> I have nothing useful to say so here's Sweetie Belle in a shoe. http://derpy.me/dLFFQ
<alexxm> i don't have enough money to spend on plushies
<spitfirecolt2> i want all the plushies
<PonyNegZero> StinkomanFan: clay isn't that expensive...
<Alpha-Omega> I'm surprised
<spitfirecolt2> somebody at the con over the weekend should have asked about plushies
<Alpha-Omega> The handmade mlp plush toys look extremely accurate
<StinkomanFan> Yeah, but I have TONS of soap scraps just lying around
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbIGnY_DSIE&feature=BFa&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ
<StinkomanFan> My mom's a soapmaker soooo
<PonyNegZero> StinkomanFan: well, clay will probably sell easier than soap... just saying
<StinkomanFan> Who wouldn't want to rub themselves with Rainbow Dash?
<StinkomanFan> In the shower
<PonyNegZero> A lot of people would hate to see her dissolve...
<Alpha-Omega> Dang I wish I still had a job
<StinkomanFan> ..... I guess I'll just try to chisel things out of the wood in our backyard...
<PonyNegZero> awww... status meeting in 5 minutes...

<Flyboy> can you design your own!?!?!?
<StinkomanFan> Gameboys could withstand a nuclear blast for godsake!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Shit was tough back then
<StinkomanFan> But you drop a DS and everything's gone
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The GameCube. One unit was demonstrated to survive bludgeoning with bats, thrown like a ball and towed on pavement by a moving car. It still worked.
<StinkomanFan> Everything
<VenHur96> SpadeMagnes[R]: Mines is still alright besides some straches, however, like I said, the touch screen of it isn't working at times, it's all...white.
<Dermathil> I don't know Flyboy
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Get this
<SpadeMagnes[R]> a guy once wrote in to Nintendo Power, saying his SNES and Super Mario World cartridge survived a fire that destroyed the rest of the house it was in!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> That shit is tough
<Flyboy> i want to make a golf club and make a move where you kick the guy to the ground and wack his head of with the golf club
<Dermathil> I doon't know if it can be easily made
<Dermathil> they're pretty much mods
<VenHur96> SpadeMagnes[R]: Whoa, whoa, whoa, really? Damm, that catridge must of has been Chuck Norris in disguide.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Says on the page i have up the famicom cartidges can shrug off getting ran over by a truck
<StinkomanFan> One LPer took a FIRE TO POKEMON RED
<StinkomanFan> AND IT STILL WORKED
<SpadeMagnes[R]> When Carlos Mencia decided to destroy a Nintendo 64 for his show Mind of Mencia, it took two strikes from a large mallet before any visible cracks formed in the case.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Seriously what the fuck did they use to build stuff back then?
<VenHur96> Flyboy: Seems like a concept for a Mortal Kombat fatality, only you remove the golf cub and replaces with a...idk, a chainsaw or something.
<alexxm> SpadeMagnes[R] hell i once saw a game boy that was in the first iraq that apprently still worked
<Flyboy> VenHur96: you replace it with the guy's arm XD
<VenHur96> Flyboy: xD Yeah.
<JRP2234[Web]> i has got source filmmaker thingy
<StinkomanFan> ...Has anyone ever tried to destroy a Wii, out of curiousity?
<valoreins|Drawing> dont have a wii :\
<VenHur96> Flyboy: My first Mortal Kombat game was Trilogy on the N64, never owned another MK game until I got my hands on MK9 for the PS3, Kratos inculded.
<alexxm> my first mortal kombat game was shaolin monks
<Meanwhile> I liked Shaolin Monks.
<StinkomanFan> But now you drop a disk on the floor and it's too scratched up for anything
<Meanwhile> It was fun with a mate.
<StinkomanFan> Teehee, Mate. It's funny because it implies something in the States
<VenHur96> I like the ironic idea that Street Fighter wasn't well known from the first game, but it was the sequel, Street Fighter II, that actually made the series famous, weird...maybe it's was because of Guile?
<Alpha-Omega> Who wants to play rainbow dash ayyack?
<VenHur96> I has a Wii, but never EVER wants to destroy that, or any other consoles, y'see, I been a longtime Nintendo fan, and I even owned all the consoles expect some handhelds.
<Alpha-Omega> attack
<valoreins|Drawing> anyone wanna take a peek of what im drawing right now?
<StinkomanFan> Is it pron?
<VenHur96> NES, SNES, N64, Gamecube, Wii, GBA, and the DS.
<VenHur96> That's all I has.
<valoreins|Drawing> not porn, but a bit suggestive
<StinkomanFan> I wish I had an NES
<StinkomanFan> Or an Atari
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Gamecube was best console
<VenHur96> Now for my other consoles, I has an Xbox, the original, a PS1, a PS3, and a PSP. I used to has the PS2 though...
<Alpha-Omega> I want it as an app
<Braviary> Nah, the Nintendo 64 was. It revolutionized multiplayer.
<StinkomanFan> WELCOME TO WARIO WORLD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Braviary: meh
<alexxm> i had a gameboy colour gameboy advance ps2 xbox ps3 and xbox 360
<Braviary> Don't you meh me, Mario Party 2 was the shit.
<XAX> I have a PS2 and a PC. WHAT NOW?!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Majora's Mask is a awesome zelda game
<VenHur96> Gamecube was the console of my childhood, Melee, Luigi's Mansion, Simpsons Road Rage, SA2 Battle, Metroid Prime 1 (and 2)...sigh, Good times.
<StinkomanFan> <3 Luigi's Mansion
<Derpy_at_work> who's streaming?
<RADISH> mario sunshine
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Gamecube was the console that managed to show its powers better than the other consoles at launch
<StinkomanFan> Remember that Hanging Luigi easter egg?
<Braviary> Melee was good, but Brawl has to be my favorite SSB game. And my Luigi's Mansion broke before I beat it.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Luigi's Mansion is awesome
<VenHur96> Oh yeah, and Mario Sunshine, couldn't forget that either, my first mario game I played...
<Braviary> They need to rerelease Super Mario Sunshine for the 3DS.
<Meanwhile> The first Mario game you played was Sunshine? You really picked the bottom of the barrel didn't ya.
<Braviary> Meanwhile, there was nothing wrong with Sunshine.
<RADISH> sunshiner is legit
<Alpha-Omega> ahh my preteen years
<VenHur96> I like how the fact of why Chuggaaconroy don't play just games, he played games some peoples never heard of.
<StinkomanFan> In the phone room for a SPLIT SECOND if you catch it Luigi's shadow in the lightening turns into his figure hanging from the ceiling
<Meanwhile> Braviary: That's a matter for debate. One that I do not feel like having.
<Alpha-Omega> It was kind of boring
<Braviary> Personally, my favorite was SM64DS. It was SM64... with Luigi!
<Quick_Thinker> ok guys after a long time of typing i have re writen M Little Pony Day Z is Magic
<StinkomanFan> And Wario
<StinkomanFan> And Yoshi
<StinkomanFan> Not Waluigi though
<VenHur96> StinkomanFan: I never seen the hanging Luigi secret, but I later found it out in a top 10. When I sawed it, my childhood wasn't the same...
<Braviary> Yes, but Luigi was the big one.
<VenHur96> ...ever again.
<Princess_Cadence> Hai
<StinkomanFan> That was just a peek at how scary Nintendo could get
<Braviary> I remember this forum I regulared for a few years, the number of people who came asking how to unlock Waluigi (and Sonic) were astounding.
<VenHur96> I mean, god Nintendo, I know Luigi has his own game now besides...Mario is Missing but...DANG!
<Braviary> VenHur96, that's not an Easter Egg, that's a glitch with the shadows.
<VenHur96> And just as Luigi couldn't feel more sorry for himself.
<StinkomanFan> Remember Eternal Darkness?
<Braviary> It's just a COMPLETELY FITTING glitch with the shadows.
<Princess_Cadence> brb
<VenHur96> Which is why I love Luigi as my number 1 favorite Super Mario character.
<Derpy_at_work> who's streaming?
<StinkomanFan> It's unknown if it's a glitch or an Easter Egg
<StinkomanFan> >New Mario games
<Alpha-Omega> Nintendo couldn't be scary if they made a game avout it
<StinkomanFan> >Mario gets rich
<StinkomanFan> >Luigi gets traumatized
<StinkomanFan> Alpha-Omega
<StinkomanFan> Kirby
<StinkomanFan> Marx, Zero2
<Princess_Cadence> back!
<VenHur96> I heard of Eternal Darkness from Screwattack, it's this horror game with a dark storyline, at first, It seemed like another basic game, until...
<Braviary> The closest it could get to being real would be if Nintendo noticed the glitch and kept it in. They would not add it intentionally and be able to keep it as an E rated game.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Welcome to Carousel Boutique, may I help you? http://youtu.be/JEmjwpOuQGY
<VenHur96> *my tv turns off, my point of view* "What the hell happens to the gam-" *gameplay comes back on* "...Mommy?"

<StinkomanFan> >ALL SAVES DELETED
<Alpha-Omega> Weird *yay* doesn't scare me but interests me
<StinkomanFan> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<Alpha-Omega> He doesn't know how
<Kandarihu> It's hard to be scared by it when you know the game is screwing with you.
<VenHur96> I <3 Kirby. That little black hole in the form of a cute pink...erh...thing.
*SpadeMagnes[R] throws a boot to the head of everypony in the chat

<Princess_Cadence> Secret butt fun.
<Alpha-Omega> Ha I'm immune my mom throws shoes at me. It's kind of normal
<VenHur96> Eternal Darkness was probally made by the Trololol guy...because, y'know, game's trolling at times.

<Meanwhile> Dat ass.
<ShadowQuill> Just asking, can you RP as your OC?
<sagas> He cant stand black porn...
<Kandarihu> It's electric torture. The guy who built it only thought of how much power to channel through the victim's body without any thought of how to manage that power.
<Meanwhile> Lol film crew.
<sagas> Just keep filming
<SirGanjalf> Is this the episode in which Ruckus goes to White Heaven?
<sagas> sure why not
<Meanwhile> Sewercide?
<CK|Catnap> XD

<OmegaMetroidBrony> No
<derpy_pony> 2 million views on youtube
<Freefall29> everyone knows reality shows are scripted
<OmegaMetroidBrony> WB BronyInstrumental
<OctaviaDashPie1797> DEAD.
<sagas> just let him dangle
<SirGanjalf> "Ruckus was here"
<Dken2021> clearly they didn't go to harvard
<Bronysith> i love black people...hate niggers. but love black people
<derpy_pony> the actors in these reality shows get only 250€ per day...one of 20 gets through the casting
<sagas> rap music and 40oz
<ShadowQuill> Are we allowed by Bronystate rules to roleplay as our OCs?
<Freefall29> Bronysith: chris rock
<Meanwhile> ShadowQuill: You are not allowed to rp here, period.
<StinkomanFan> We can't RP here
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Only maid hour
<derpy_pony> and they all dream of being discovered as actor
<ShadowQuill> Meanwhile: I wasn't going there, but it is good to know.
<CK|Catnap> xD
<Freefall29> what qualifies as roleplay?
<Dermathil> not even maid hour last I heard.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> But VERYVERY VERY Lightly
<OctaviaDashPie1797> When is it gonna change.
<killerpony7733> ShadowQuill: No but there are RP channels here
<valoreins|Drawing> is this maid hour yet?
<SirGanjalf> dat KKK poster6_9
<sagas> BET: We Hate Black People
<Litwick> Is that a fucking KKK dude picture on the wall?
<RainBowJack> wait wait he is anti black?
<OctaviaDashPie1797> RP channels?
<Dken2021> this is what BET actually belives
<killerpony7733> ShadowQuill: So if you want to RP find one of the RP channels
<OctaviaDashPie1797> What's an RP?
<OctaviaDashPie1797> Roleplay?
<Bronysith> BOONDOCKS was made by a black dude
<ShadowQuill> killerpony7733: There's a such thing? Where are they? Just curious.
<RainBowJack> rolePlay
<OctaviaDashPie1797> KNEW IT.
<derpy_pony> lol
<GilDash> OctaviaDashPie1797: Aye.
<DashieMusic2> that is a KKK guy on the wall
<Freefall29> BET. If its not limiting black people to rap, and other black stereotypes, its a bet.
<derpy_pony> this is easy
<OctaviaDashPie1797> Link, please.
<Meanwhile> Dat profound insight.
<sagas> THis is strange
<ShadowQuill> Where are the RP channels?
<sagas> Yeah blame the black intern
<Bronysith> made by Aaron McGruder. WHOM IS BLACK
<OmegaMetroidBrony> God damn sibligns

<Dken2021> dat big ass chain
<prince-dari> "Solifugae are the subject of many urban legends and exaggerations about their size, speed, behaviour, appetite, and lethality. They are not especially large, the biggest having a leg span of about 12 cm (4.7 in).[8] They are fast on land compared to other invertebrates. The fastest can run at a speed of roughly 16 km/h (10 mph) for a short distance, nearly half as fast as the fastest human sprinter. Members of this order of Arachnida apparently have no venom, with the possible exception of one species in India (Rhagodes nigrocinctus) as suggested in one study,[15] and do not spin webs."
<MegaMoonShine> A boat car?
<prince-dari> No venom at all.
<prince-dari> They're not dangerous.

<sagas> And he didnt suffocate -_-
<sergio_scriptor> to much han solo carbonite reference
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But the fact that they run 10 mph is about 20 more than they should be capable of reaching ._.

<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: Meaning they go -10 mph? O_o

<Kammerjunk> MaidSurge: Similar? All Dragonforce songs sound exactly the same.
<Chrysalis> Thats better
<Whiskra> I acctually discovered this song on my sisters computer (tho she never listened to it) way before GH3 got released
<VenHur96> Chuck Norris beats this song on expert mode...with no hands.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Because every household should have a wonder boner.

<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.
<Chrysalis> they are absolutely NUTS
<Vordox> VenHur96: Noone likes Chuck Norris jokes anymore
<CK|Catnap> "They all sound the same". Is that sort of like how my parents claim that Coca Cola and Pepsi "taste exactly the same" despite that clearly not being the case? You guys telling me you're getting old already?
<alexxm> Chrysalis what were they like live
<Pudge> you gotta fish with your wonder boner on your johnson

<Chrysalis> mosh pits to dragonforce are just crazy
<CK|Catnap> Kammerjunk: Can tell the difference between the regular and decaf stuff, too.
<Kammerjunk> CK|Catnap: The mind is a powerful thing, though.
<CountDoofus> Dunno what to do... continue writing, draw something, or just go to bed early...
<Chrysalis> CK|Catnap but can you tell the difference between coke and pepsi?
<OctaviaDashPie1797> Draw.
<RainBowJack> SCOOT best Rock singer
<MaidSurge> Chrysalis: dat true. This song live must be quite a thing.

<CK|Catnap> Chrysalis: It's....not hard actually. Pepsi has pretty much no flavor by comparison. >_>
<RainBowJack> feeling pinkie keep
<Pudge> yeah
<Chrysalis> CK|Catnap i usually find it easy to tell because pepsi has an aftertaste that coke doesnt
<Chrysalis> ooh top10 songs
<Dken2021> don't coke and pepsi taste the same?
<OctaviaDashPie1797> NO/
<Pudge> epic
<OctaviaDashPie1797> THEY DON'T.
<Baxter> No my good sir
<Pudge> also coke>pepsi :)
<OctaviaDashPie1797> Nuh-uh, Pepsi>Coke.
<CountDoofus> Bronystate Art Contest, eh? To Tartarus with writing.
<CK|Catnap> Chrysalis: Coke's also got some subtle differences in the flavor. Pepsi's focus is more on the sugar content, so Coke's flavor is more detectable if you pay attention.
*MaidSurge airguitars
<Pudge> I call war :[
<Meanwhile> I like coke and pepsi.
<Dken2021> and I just heard my uncle is using skype with somebody

<CK|Catnap> You can tell the difference between regular and decaf Coke/Pepsi, too, if you pay attention. The decaf stuff usually triggers a headache if you drink too rapidly, and the flavor is off.

<GarrettBrony> so those kids have kinect?
<Alister> NOOBS
<ZappyTheUnicorn> I'm no Silverscreen, but:The Wild Gunman video game in Cafe 80's was specially made for the film. Wild Gunman was an actual light gun game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but was never a dedicated arcade cabinet. It was, however, included in many of Nintendo's Play Choice 10 machines, hence why a lightgun was on the cabinet. The sound effects heard in the movie are from the game, but, the on screen
<Bronysith> LIKE A BAWS
<JESmith71> Kinect must be thenorm in 2015
