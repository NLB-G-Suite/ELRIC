<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: CHOCOLATE?
<Prince_Lightstar> streamer fal again
<CTHULHU> i like that song\
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Did you just say.....CHOCOLATE?
<prince-dari> Using a spellchecker and making sure you use proper punctuation and grammar would make it look a lot better to start with.
<thelonecubone> http://i.imgur.com/47AkI.gif
<thegt90> its the soundtrack from the movie twister
<VenHur> AJIsAwesome: Yes sir!
<VenHur> AJIsAwesome: With or without nuts?
<AJIsAwesome> Chocolate? CHOCOLATE?!
<Barbetos> dayum dose some big trees!
<Prince_Lightstar> what is this mod
<Barbetos> BEHOLD THE FLUTTATREES
<jcelios> Feed the Beast!
<jcelios> ^mod name
<Barbetos> No
<prince-dari> You also seem to ramble about things quite irrelevent to your ban, and which often seem to have no decipherable meaning.
<Fluttershy_ewe> I would like to be a tree
<jcelios> ye
<Barbetos> donotwant
<VenHur> MEANWHILE, IN THE HALL OF SHIZUKA
<jcelios> Barbetos: No means yes!
<KrazyNoobs> I AM a tree.
<Prince_Lightstar> jcelios: wat do u feed the beast?
<Deacon> Prince_Blueblood soylent green
<Barbetos> whoa
<Barbetos> dem trees
<Marco> dem trees idd
<flutterchu> im predicting im not gonna be unbanned
<jcelios> I'm not sure of the origin of the name but I think of it as minecraft being the beast and the large number of new stuff as the food :P
<Barbetos> Thos are some REAL trees
<Marco> also what's the music? it reminds me of diablo 2
<KrazyNoobs> HAX
<Prince_Lightstar> do the sound effect come with mod?
<jcelios> probably
<KrazyNoobs> Yes sir
<twilight_squirtle> Marco: i think its led zeppelin
<KrazyNoobs> It doesnt
<KrazyNoobs> Sorry about hta
<Marco> oh kewl
<scout19_tf2> dat sream
<prince-dari> On an appeal you don't generally say why you want to be unbanned, rather state why you were banned, and what will do differently, what you have learnt, why we should give you another chance, etc.
<Prince_Lightstar> Shizuka: PLZ DONT CAPS SRRY
<Barbetos> I'm confused
<twilight_squirtle> Marco: or maybe pink floyd
<flutterchu> can i answer those right now?
<twilight_squirtle> oh
*Marco shrugs
<Marco> either way, i like it
<Prince_Lightstar> science is used in the makin of this stream
<Deacon> science you say?
<Marco> true that youngun
<Prince_Lightstar> Deacon: yes
<prince-dari> I think it would be better for you to write an appeal, then you will have more time to think over what you're written, edit it; make sure it has proper spelling and grammar.
<Barbetos> http://derpy.me/I3e5i
<Barbetos> I can't see the difference the last part
<Barbetos> Halp
<flutterchu> okay, i realized im handling my behavior alot better then when i was taking to Sumica

<Marco> neight Scootaflew :3
<CTHULHU> night dude.
<CTHULHU> what was that in the water?
<kidzrul732> hey bronies I was just watching Yogi Bear and the Neverending Story of the Spruce Goose
<Quadrenaro> I must sleep
<Marco> well good night to you too then :>
<Quadrenaro> I have a doctor appointment in the morning
<Quadrenaro> night!
<sub06905> Shizuka: dats one big tank
<Yeeha7> rarity is a beyatch
<Marco> s/beyatch/sweetheart/
<VenHur> Yay, Scootaloos!
<Yeeha7> Apple Bloom hawt
<Deacon> Yeeha7 but why? she's sweet
<sub06905> dem rain sounds~
<thelonecubone> Yeeha7: yeah, this isnt 4chan
<Yeeha7> jk
<sub06905> why not use steam engines?
<CTHULHU> or the force.
<sub06905> sure they require coal but, i think its a bit faster
<Marco> about that, sometimes /mlp/ scares me more than /b/ does, silly internet :<
<CTHULHU> Why.
<Deacon> eh, /mlp/ seems tame to me
<Marco> dunnaw, it's like... yeah... no
<Buytoast> well, anthro horse porn can be fairly terrifying
<Marco> yep
<thelonecubone> Buytoast: true true
<Marco> it's just that mlp is precious and innocent to me, but i should have known that the internet would make it go all /b/
<Marco> ohwell C:
<emangamer> so apparently new epic rap battle
<emangamer> santa kicked some major ass
<thelonecubone> emangamer: really?
<Buytoast> the epic rap battles are terrible
<emangamer> thelonecubone yeah, santa vs moses
<thelonecubone> ah
<sub06905> didnt really like the new erbs lately
<Marco> wat? not even jesus vs moses?
<emangamer> the new one is awesome, next to moses
<Buytoast> lately?
<emangamer> moses did pretty bad ><
<CTHULHU> I like krampus.
<emangamer> Marco because of the argument over whether christmas is actually christain with santa and those things
<Marco> hmkay
<Midnight_Fyre> I think there are two different people doing epic pony rap battles. One of them seems to be a lot better than the other
<sub06905> but i did like the doctor who vs doc brown~
<emangamer> Midnight_Fyre I think they just actually added people to it not a different cast
<Ponies47> ME AGIAN! :D
<emangamer> I do like yaplap doing the persenting
<thelonecubone> wb Ponies47 :)
<sub06905> Ponies47 pls go you left already
<sub06905> :I
<Midnight_Fyre> emangamer: Well, they are uploaded on two different accounts and one of the accounts has much higher quality rapping than the other
<thelonecubone> shub, be nice
<thelonecubone> :I
<emangamer> the EPRBoE was really really close
<emangamer> Midnight_Fyre no, they switched to EPRBoE instead of on mic's channel
<sub06905> the what now?
<[]DeadpoolDash> so who is minecrafting it up in the stream?
<emangamer> epic pony rap battles of equestria
<Buytoast> any kind of "epic rap battles" are terrible
<sub06905> any plans for all that water you're collecting shizu?
<Midnight_Fyre> Neither one is mic's channel. That said, they very well could be the same people behind them both, and it seems probable if it is
<emangamer> man the pony battle was really close...
<Marco> hm, rap isn't my favourite music genre, but i do enjoy the epic rap battles slightly, i like how they go all dressed up top notch so they actually match the real character's looks and stuff
<emangamer> I dunno who won :/
<Midnight_Fyre> I do generally hate rap, but the rap battles are fun
<emangamer> I'd say it's a draw honestally ><
<TheGentleManBrony> anyone else notice how the front of Diamond Tiaras mane looks like a painted turd?
<Drew> lol
<Midnight_Fyre> nope, never noticed that
<Marco> >mlfw i read it as Iron Tank Vulva
<Marco> TheGentleManBrony: lolwat
<TheGentleManBrony> Or gak
<TheGentleManBrony> SOrry.
<TheGentleManBrony> that stuff.
<Marco> lol
<Kurra> Oh dear Luna D:
<CTHULHU> fucks that stuff.
<Marco> i kind of liked the *censored* spam
<Kurra> I just found a pony fic reference in The Amazing World of Gumball D:
<TheGentleManBrony> the stuff with the name.
<TheGentleManBrony> that gets said a lot
<sub06905> time for mass collection of lava
<Drew> It most be rubberized troll fat
<Kurra> also, hai all :>
<Marco> lel
<sub06905> ello Kurra
<Drew> must*
<Marco> Kurra: what is it?
<Marco> and ohai
<TheGentleManBrony> Drew: what are you referring to?
<Drew> The g word
<Buytoast> amazing world of gumball is bad too
<Deacon> It's the G to the A and then come the K, don't you be mentioning it or someone'll kick your A
<Midnight_Fyre> So I got the Season 1 DVD in the mail a few days ago and I was watching Boast Busters on the TV tonight, and my mom and sister walked in in the middle of it and sat down to watch the second half. Now they think I'm weirder than ever
<Kurra> its a reference to one of the scary fics.
<texasboykc09> hello everypony
<Deacon> lali-ho texasboykc09

<Sabershy> Thank you for the stream, Shizuka. :)
<Midnight_Fyre> night Sabershy
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Sabershy. :)
<thelonecubone> Night Sabershy :)
<AJIsAwesome> *guessing because of
<CTHULHU> sleep is for the weak.
<Deacon> Gumball confuses me, it's setting is really random
<Kurra> I like the fact that many of the characters allude to real life social exclusions that adults do.
<Marco> s/weak/mortal organic life forms/
<Marco> oh yeah... no regex bot
<Marco> WHY'S THAT?
<Deacon> all the characters are random too

<Marco> hihi
<Marco> we'd give her a diamond armor, that'll do
<Marco> you silly, just use your flying powers!
<CTHULHU> kidzrul732: it would be cute towatch her play.
<DerpyMuffins> I can totally imagine her playing Bio Shock
<Marco> too bad we never will
<Marco> in this dimension!
<LT_SKINNY> haha "would you kindly 'yay?'" :D
<CTHULHU> life sucks. :(
<Marco> :(
<TheGentleManBrony> neigh
<RoboGerbil> in before Shizuka jumps off the tree
<Marco> let's create a portal to a parallel universe where all humans are ponies
<Deacon> but life is fun, only problem I have with the game is the respawning glitch
<thelonecubone> DerpyMuffins, Could you kindly give me a cookie :3
<Marco> Deacon: true that!
<TheGentleManBrony> Marco is Reverse Lyra
<Marco> xD
<DerpyMuffins> Scones are the best I can do thelonecubone
<CTHULHU> mans: you are a mad man! how do we do it?!
<NullRadix> thelonecubone: we don't have cookies here, you might try asking the Dark Side
<thelonecubone> oh
<thelonecubone> NullRadix: i'll try
<LT_SKINNY> Marco do we even have that technology? 0.o
<NullRadix> we're more of a muffin and cupbake crowd
<Marco> i suppose not... yet LT_SKINNY :(
<AJIsAwesome> thelonecubone: Do you mind if you help me with something? :)
<Marco> or they're just hiding it from us!
<thelonecubone> cupbake. lol
<NullRadix> om nom
<thelonecubone> AJIsAwesome: okay
<AJIsAwesome> Alright. One minute.
<TheGentleManBrony> Everytime someone pronounces Lyra as Leera I cringe and get the urge to punch the computer.
<LT_SKINNY> Big Brother is hanging out with ponies... those BASTARDS :[
<Marco> well, the most realistic answer to individually visiting parallel universes is lucid dreaming :3
<Deacon> like some people that pronounce mario as "mare Y oh?"
<TheGentleManBrony> That's actually valid.
<LT_SKINNY> Marco: I have yet to perfect that :/
<Marco> ProTip: practice meditation, it really helps
*gunthler
<Marco> the possibilities of your mind are like.. endless!
<TheGentleManBrony> For meditation u need green tea.
<TheGentleManBrony> at least I do.
<Marco> green tea is neat :3
<CTHULHU> the government totally sucks. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qG5Q58ecgc
<TheGentleManBrony> CTHULHU no video links during a stream.
<thelonecubone> no video links during stream
<RaveBrony> Hey, stream is on
<thelonecubone> damn man
<CTHULHU> k
<LT_SKINNY> I cant argue with that. After all, we have ponies to prove this :)
<Deacon> welp, my flygon's EV training is done, I guess I'll leave for now, seeya
<thelonecubone> read the rules and FAQ
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Deacon. :)
<Marco> yeah, tenacious-d are awesome
<Marco> cya Deacon
<LT_SKINNY> Take it easy Deacon
<texasboykc09> Deacon: bye
<TheGentleManBrony> Bai Deacon.
<TheGentleManBrony> thank u for agreeing with me about Sweetie Belle.
<TheGentleManBrony> and shti.
<TheGentleManBrony> shit
<LT_SKINNY> afk
<Marco> he made me lose the game with his quit message :|
<CTHULHU> KILL THE GOAT!!!
<TheGentleManBrony> So does the music just come with the game or is Shizuka playing it?
<Marco> i'm wondering that as well
<Marco> i'm guessing it's not in game
<CTHULHU> it's not bad.
<NullRadix> minecraft has music. I'm fairly sure this isn't it
<CTHULHU> cool.
<DerpyMuffins> Derpy needs her own episode
<TheGentleManBrony> I prefer Aphex Twin and Autechre as far as electronic music goes.
<NullRadix> FINE
<CTHULHU> DerpyMuffins: damnright.
<NullRadix> ... just doesn't seem to fit the environment
<TheGentleManBrony> Maybe play some Tom Waits?
<CTHULHU> or metal.
<TheGentleManBrony> Tom Waits is better.
<CTHULHU> bunk!
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: hey
<TheGentleManBrony> at least better than Metallica.
<TheGentleManBrony> and maybe Iron Maiden.
<DerpyMuffins> Naga?

<DerpyMuffins> Thanks Shizuka
*SpadeKyurem[WoW] plays E.G.G.M.A.N
<VenHur> Minecraft.
<Marco> Phase4: but linux doesn't support executables
<Kandarihu> Thanks for streaming
<texasboykc09> Cypresswolf: minecraft
<Marco> you could always try wine or mono, but it's going to cause lag for sure
<texasboykc09> Shizuka: thanks for the stream
<Marco> thanks indeed, enjoyed it :3
<Phase4> Marco: uh... linux cant launch .exe's natively sure but i'm not interested in that
<thelonecubone> thanks for the stream Shizuka :)
<Cypresswolf> Sorry I missed out on that
<VenHur> In memories of the Buffer Show...
<Marco> oh, what is it then?
<CTHULHU> it wasent boring.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGZzayBtHgw
<Phase4> Marco: i'm in the steam for linux beta
<Phase4> and would primarally like to share the tf2 content files which are the same across all operating systems
<Marco> ah
<Yeeha7> eyup
<DerpyMuffins> How is steam on linux Phase4?
<texasboykc09> i hate when i close the wrong tab
<Marco> well, i didn't get invited for the steam for linux beta :( so i wouldn't know
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins: so far its almost perfect
<J_E_Smith71> VenHur: I perfer this over the Buffer Show
<Marco> wb Yeeha7
<Marco> poor texasboykc09 :P
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins: its actually more stable than on windows
<Yeeha7> wb?
<Marco> opengl > activex :D
<Phase4> only problems i'm finding are the result of graphics driver problems
<Phase4> mostly nvidia and their bug ridden crap
<DerpyMuffins> Any lag so far Phase4?
<Phase4> Marco: i think you meen direct x XD
<CTHULHU> who gonna stream next?
<Marco> yeah yeah :<
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLeqLaIFNx0
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins: nvidia driver bug causes some problems and it lags a bit when loading resources
<Phase4> cl_forcepreload 1 solves most of the latter
<texasboykc09> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_BL5EKwSqE fireplace
<Marco> why does it remind me of the 11th doctor's theme?
<LT_SKINNY> back
<Marco> wb
<LT_SKINNY> thanks :)
<LT_SKINNY> wat i miss?
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins: if it wasnt for nvidias lack of propper optimus suport it would actually be faster on linux
<CTHULHU> FIER!!!!!!
<DerpyMuffins> Everything has its kinks Phase4, not everything is perfect
<Marco> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUMEzUMcu64
<CTHULHU> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW1-pN7pfsw
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins: wish it was that simple :( some software out there has more kinks than function
<texasboykc09> Phase4: yep
<DerpyMuffins> Is it in beta or alpha right now Phase4?
<texasboykc09> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXa6GaEozV4
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins: steam is in beta
<texasboykc09> Phase4: what was the worst software you ever used?
<CTHULHU> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBmeD8KU0hI&list=PLyvqv_dznLtxX_XhGHIQgvLZioPp7WtUx&index=19
<DerpyMuffins> Any file share problems Phase4?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dat jaymoo
<Jmo> dat aniderp
<Phase4> texasboykc09: thats a complicated question
<texasboykc09> phase4 how?
<DerpyMuffins> There are systems worst in some areas
<NullRadix> texasboykc09: because there are various kinds of bad
<Phase4> well theres the software that simply doesnt work, the well implimented but poorly designed stuff, the poorly implimented but well designed
<Phase4> and the poorly implimented and poorly designed (this usualy simply doesnt work)
<DerpyMuffins> ^ I know that feel
<texasboykc09> Phase4: that explains why
<LT_SKINNY> what are we hating on?
<NullRadix> softare

<LT_SKINNY> haha I see I see :)
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Cue Seinfield Slap Bass

<thelonecubone> ^^^
<LT_SKINNY> Patience is best virtue ;)
<Marco> yeaah right, like i'm gonna believe that
<emangamer> Phase4 I need to make it a habit to read The Moderator every now and again. So much feels
<thelonecubone> Marco: you leave the computer, that means you have a life
*emangamer realizes he has a test tomorrow he hasnt studied for O_O
<emangamer> ....shit
<thelonecubone> emangamer: D:
<thelonecubone> you're so screwed
<LT_SKINNY> thats not good :(
<Buytoast> psh, studyin is for nerds
<emangamer> it's fine, I know it pretty okay
<texasboykc09> emangamer: thats me
<DerpyMuffins> Sleep on your textbook emangamer, it helps
<AJIsAwesome> emangamer: Study, you fool! D:
<LT_SKINNY> DerpyMuffins: :D
<emangamer> I'm pretty good at human geo
<Buytoast> i didn't study for my ACT and i got a double digit number
<CTHULHU> I guess I dont got one.
<Yahooz> Lawl Buytoast
<Marco> thelonecubone: nahhh they don't ;D
<thelonecubone> Buytoast: but Uncle sam Studyin to be the Best Killing Machine
<LT_SKINNY> Buytoast seems legit...
<Buytoast> we don't need to study that
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijzMnFr-8Tc&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&feature=mh_lolz Anthropology!
<Buytoast> we're naturally born killing machines
<texasboykc09> Buytoast: did you pass
<emangamer> BuytoastI didnt study for my ACT and got like a 28
<Buytoast> hey, i got a 27!
<Buytoast> you see
<emangamer> doode
<emangamer> high five
<Yahooz> i didnt take the ACT
<Buytoast> studyin is for nerds
<Yahooz> just the SAT
<Kencolt> ACT?
<emangamer> (\
<LT_SKINNY> great job :D
<emangamer> but in college
<DerpyMuffins> I barely got a 26 on my ACT
<CrystalPhoenix> I have a question
<emangamer> a 27 is good an ANY TEST
<Buytoast> shit i dont remember the SAT
<texasboykc09> all two did well i see
<Yahooz> emangamer: out of 100? nah
<LT_SKINNY> When I took the SAT two years ago, I think I got a 2060...
<texasboykc09> ^^
<CrystalPhoenix> why can't we have musicals like singing in the rain or the music man today?
<emangamer> Yahooz *raises his hands* college
<DerpyMuffins> ACT and SAT are based out of 34
<Yahooz> i got a 2170 on my SAT
<DerpyMuffins> 27/34 isn't bad
<emangamer> sat is based out of a 34?
<LT_SKINNY> Yahooz :NotBad:
<Yahooz> SAT is out of 2400
<emangamer> how da hell did I get a 28
<Kencolt> CrystalPhoenix: We can. They're called "The Music Man" and "Singing in the Rain". We still have them.
<emangamer> 2120
<emangamer> ^*
<thelonecubone> Oh fuck, the Sat. Damn it
<DerpyMuffins> Damn, wrong test
<Buytoast> hell, the only thing that screwed me over with the ACT was the math part
<emangamer> 34 is near impossible to get on the ACT though
<Yahooz> And the ACT is out of 36
<Yahooz> not 34
<DerpyMuffins> So close
<Yahooz> I have a friend who got a 35
<emangamer> well then 36 is near impossible
<CrystalPhoenix> Kencolt, did you get what I meant
<LT_SKINNY> yeah, I heard its pretty tough to get 25+
<Kencolt> What is the ACT, by the way?
<emangamer> optional test you dont have to take
<Yahooz> A standardized test
<Buytoast> a smart thing
<emangamer> but makesy ou look way better
<Vordox> Have some opera
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAabtQZSdlE&list=FLAViXIrbp86kg5lvVfFdQuQ&index=26
<Vordox> Well...
<DerpyMuffins> Harvard requires you get atleast a 32
<LT_SKINNY> ^
<Vordox> Tactful Singing opera mix
<Kencolt> I suppose it was after my time.
<twilight_squirtle> Kencolt: same as SAT only somewhat different sections
<LT_SKINNY> Tests you on different things
<Yahooz> DerpyMuffins: there arent any requirements, persay, although yes, assuming you are going for athletics, they would like to see AT LEAST that
<DerpyMuffins> Why are we talking about test?
<Yahooz> because we can
<LT_SKINNY> Because theres no stream :D
<twilight_squirtle> iirc it was ACT with the "science" section? damn that section was dumb, just have to be able to read fast in the morning
<DerpyMuffins> I meant how did it start?
<twilight_squirtle> didnt actually require any knowledge of science
<LT_SKINNY> Um... Yahooz, I think
<texasboykc09> http://www.rainymood.com/
<Yahooz> you think what?
<LT_SKINNY> Didnt you start the SAT/ACT discussion?
<Yahooz> no
<LT_SKINNY> oops...
<CrystalPhoenix> but seriously I just finished watching singing in the rain and it made me think
<Yahooz> that would be Buytoast
<DerpyMuffins> ^
<LT_SKINNY> there you go :P
<Buytoast> what now?
<CrystalPhoenix> Do the actors today really deserve the praise they have?
<DerpyMuffins> Some do
<Yahooz> you started the standardized test discussion
<CrystalPhoenix> I want more musical dammit
<CrystalPhoenix> they are fun
<Yahooz> which is kind of obsolete to me at least, I got admitted recently
<DerpyMuffins> Btw you scored one higher than me Buytoast
<Buytoast> ha
<LT_SKINNY> Yahooz where at? :)
<CrystalPhoenix> and oh god I love tap shoe
<Yahooz> Bucknell Univeristy
<Buytoast> my mind is greater
<Buytoast> Uncle Sam would be proud.
<LT_SKINNY> Congrats!
<Yahooz> thanks
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone know the requirement for Princeton?
<Yahooz> There arent requirements
<Yahooz> *no
<Buytoast> Loads of money
<LT_SKINNY> Ive been at Sacramento State for 2 years now studying Fire Admin...
<DerpyMuffins> Loads of money: uncheck
<emangamer> I was talking about Saturn and he told me I should transfer to england XD
<emangamer> LOOK OUT MEANWHILE
<Kencolt> CrystalPhoenix: Well... those were mostly made for a different time, for a different audience-- from the Busby Berkley stuff in the depression (everyone needed cheering up) to WW2 (Much the same, but more patriotic) to the fifties (When everyone was still somewhat innocent).
<emangamer> HERE I COME
<CrystalPhoenix> Kencolt, yeah I know....
<Yahooz> You just have to fill out the application, get all the forms in, and hope you qualify as an applicant. there arent any "requirements". Applying to college is a rat race
<CrystalPhoenix> but gosh would I do anything for a good musical
<emangamer> Yahooz other than the mininum gpa/sat scores
<Kencolt> You try to make a flim like that today, with the modern audience of kids-- kids then liked that kind of thing, and well, it was more for the parents at times. TOday? You have a pack of teens wondering where the heck the blood and sex is.
<CrystalPhoenix> I mean I know there has been Sweeney Todd recently
<Yahooz> THERE ARE NO MINIMUMS. JUST BOTTOM PERCENTILES
<Yahooz> JEEZ
<LT_SKINNY> emangamer: theyre entirely optional in some schools
<CrystalPhoenix> Kencolt, yeah that is very sad
<DerpyMuffins> Harsh much Yahooz?
<Yahooz> 90 percent of the applicants who apply to Harvard are qualified. however, they can only accept 8 percent of their application pool
<Yahooz> you have to stand out
<Kencolt> Back then, you went to the movies as a family. Usually a double feature. One that the adults liked mostly-- often your musical-- and then a B picture, like a western, so the kids could thrill to whoever wore the white hat shooting the bad guy with the mustache.
<DerpyMuffins> I thought it was 6%
<Yahooz> something like that
<LT_SKINNY> Bottom line: College is a pain getting in, but once you are it gets alil easier
<DerpyMuffins> Nope
<Kencolt> Also a pack of shorts, a newsreel, and in some of the BIG movie palaces, short concerts-- they's have a small orchestra playing inbetween showings.
<Yahooz> LT_SKINNY: in most cases
<DerpyMuffins> You need to pass the classes
<Yahooz> i.e. Cornell is the easiest Ivy to get into, hardest one to stay in
<LT_SKINNY> Well derp :P Id expect nothing less from the people who DID make it in
<DerpyMuffins> Not to mention the student loans.....
<Yahooz> paying off loans are probably hte worst part
<LT_SKINNY> ^
<DerpyMuffins> I'm going to pay mines for the next decade or so
<emangamer> Yahooz dont remind me....why I'm pushing to graduate as a junior
<Yahooz> ...why?
<emangamer> Yahooz tuition and loans.... -_-
<Kencolt> It really was, after all, a different world back then. Heh-- maybe that's why we like MLP so much, that world kind of hearkens back to a simpler time, without being condecending.
<NullRadix> ^
<Yahooz> i guess, but thats a whole year of college: probably the best 4 years of your life, out the window
<DerpyMuffins> If you take enough AP classes you can practically skip a few years of collage
<emangamer> Yahooz I'm not willing to pay 30k for that year
<Yahooz> suite yourself
<DerpyMuffins> 30k?
<emangamer> give or take a few thousand
<LT_SKINNY> Thats a pretty sizeable loan... :/
<DerpyMuffins> Private school?
<emangamer> ^
<Yahooz> I can see VT being 30k
<emangamer> no it's sizable
<emangamer> out of state? yes
<CrystalPhoenix> Soon Scootaloo, soon http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1355192661438.jpg
<LT_SKINNY> I had to take out 5k for my Fire Academy
*emangamer thinks it's halirious his host name is .vt.edu in it XD
<emangamer> damn camput internet
<LT_SKINNY> ?
<Yahooz> why is that funny?
<DerpyMuffins> It helps if you know the teachers at the collage you go to
<emangamer> I dont nkow, it just is
<Yahooz> sure
<emangamer> means I cant sneak around under a false nick either
<emangamer> everyone knows it's me
<Yahooz> or PonyNegZero
<Yahooz> \
<emangamer> yeah or him
<Yahooz> either of you
<emangamer> Pneg is pretty legit
<LT_SKINNY> btw, can I register my nickname here?
<Yahooz> yes you can
<CTHULHU> It's way easier being a NEET.
<emangamer> oh man
<emangamer> you guys
<emangamer> hey you guys
<LT_SKINNY> yes?
<thelonecubone> what?
<DerpyMuffins> ?
<emangamer> NOSTALGIA TIME
<emantrollslayer> rawr
<Phase4> XD
*emantrollslayer can swing his sword sword sword his diamond sword
<DerpyMuffins> Was wondering when Phase4 would come in
<LT_SKINNY> Did you find your old alias?
<emantrollslayer> sadly it's not registered any more
<Phase4> i'm elsewhere making tech things happen
<emantrollslayer> Phase4 he'll make his own tech, with blackjack, and hookers
<LT_SKINNY> In fact, screw the tech xD
<Yahooz> if you wanted real Nastolgia, emantrollslayer, we would have 80ish of the coolest people ever
<emantrollslayer> Yahooz critic kitten, stinkoman fan, rawrity, pretty much everyone in the moderator
<CTHULHU> i like the 90's.
<thelonecubone> http://i.imgur.com/Ln5uT.jpg Oh god, Gonna save this
<emantrollslayer> oh man, those group of guise...
<LT_SKINNY> I prefer the 90's seeing as how I was born in them :D
<AJIsAwesome> thelonecubone: Use it for BMN. :D
<Yahooz> Dont forget ScootaChicken, LadyC, LC, Vivi, Nyria...
<Yahooz> the list goes on
<emantrollslayer> LC and LC stop by every now and again
<thelonecubone> AJIsAwesome: I will :D
<emantrollslayer> oh god what was nyria's origional name...
<emantrollslayer> brony.....somethiing
<Yahooz> Bronyriffic
<Marco> that's ironic, cause brony-something sounds unoriginal
<DerpyMuffins> Wow, you two going really old school Yahooz
<emantrollslayer> BRONYRIFFIC
<emantrollslayer> YESSSSSS

<emantrollslayer> Yahooz that's a damn shame. Newfoals need a good goddammitdaribot or a good otakon ship
<Yahooz> ...both are kind of outdated. classic, but outdated
<Yahooz> overused, is the better word
<emantrollslayer> the fact they were overused was what made the mhalirious
<emantrollslayer> dat otakon quit XD
<Yahooz> now things like 1/1/12 (never forget)... oh boy

<EmeraldChocolate> ^^^^^^^^^^^s Justin bieber after the dentist

<Shizuka> 13.mov is the cancer that is killing fim
<fluttercry> 05,15and an all around bad person
<emantrollslayer> the ONLY thing good to come out of that
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I used to be utterly revolted by their crap. But it's grown on me.
<emantrollslayer> is the "Watch out Ashleigh" video
<emantrollslayer> because that's genuinelly funny
<Yahooz> FiM is actually killing itself, imo
<Buytoast> eh, it aint something spectacular
<OneTrickPony> o hai Yahooz
<Yahooz> OneTrickPony!
<LT_SKINNY> OneTrickPony: brohoof from one caliboy to another? /)
<OneTrickPony> !
<Yahooz> wassup dude!
<AJIsAwesome> FiW is iffy, to me. I like it for what it is, but I don't love it.
<emantrollslayer> Am I the only person that REALLY dislikes the newest episode?
<OneTrickPony> LT_SKINNY: /)
<fluttercry> 05,15"Forget you I could eat all these apples" Crowd goes absolutely insane
<Phase4> 00,02now to install all the games
<Yahooz> emantrollslayer: i thought it was meh
<AJIsAwesome> I liked the newset episode.
<fluttercry> 05,15emantrollslayer haven't seen it
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Possibly? What's wrong with it?
<AJIsAwesome> *newest
<LT_SKINNY> :)
*emantrollslayer wont say anything
<Yahooz> 1 day rule is in effect
<Phase4> 00,02this'll be a nice stress test of steams download code
<fluttercry> 05,15In fact I haven't actually watched the last 3 episodes
<emantrollslayer> fluttercry and you call yourself a bronystate mod
<Yahooz> we /can/ talk about it
<fluttercry> 05,15Don't plan on watching the bully one either
<emantrollslayer> that one was........okay
<Yahooz> fluttercry: because ITS HAPPENING
<EmeraldChocolate> Newestep is best ep!
<LT_SKINNY> I liked Scootalove being confirmed... :(
<Buytoast> good
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Aww. But the babs seed song was great!

<Yahooz> *fried
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm sad we didn't turn that orange thing into a mascot
<Yahooz> ^
<emantrollslayer> okay, I've made my mind up
<AJIsAwesome> Why would we?
<Yahooz> Ron Paul 2012
<fluttercry> 05,15Because it'd be hilarious
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I am now imagining a very large chicken holding a box with various personal items crying as he leaves an office building.
<emantrollslayer> I think iron will won the newest epic rap battle of equestria
<emantrollslayer> sorry off topic, had to say it
<LT_SKINNY> Crap, Ive yet to see it...
<AJIsAwesome> Eh, not to me. It's somewhat revolting.
<emantrollslayer> I FUCKING CALLED IT
<LT_SKINNY> How good was it, emantrollslayer?
<Yahooz> Anyone who didnt think the stream hijack was at least the slightest bit amusing needs to calm their nips about seeing ponies... minus the tech team and streamer ofc
<emantrollslayer> LT_SKINNY really good
<Buytoast> it couldn't be good
<LT_SKINNY> Now I must see it... :I
<EmeraldChocolate> Cya all! bai!
<emantrollslayer> Yahooz I just heard about that....never saw it. sounds pretty funnny
<LT_SKINNY> Bye, EmeraldChocolate :)
<fluttercry> 05,15It was. I lol'd
<AJIsAwesome> Yahooz: Woah, I'm not talking about the hijack. I'm talking about the orange thing itself.
<fluttercry> 05,15Then I srsd
<Yahooz> emantrollslayer: its on youtube
<texasboykc09> EmeraldChocolate: bye
<fluttercry> 05,15then I lol'd again
<OneTrickPony> bye EmeraldChocolate
<Soulless_DCLXVI> It wasn't amusing to me, because it was my FIRST TIME watching it live. I was excited and had been on Bronystate for like two hours beforehand.
<NocturnalBlade> Good morning everypony, i have returned ^_^
<emantrollslayer> Soulless_DCLXVI then yes, I actually feel bad for you
<emantrollslayer> but I mean c'mon
<emantrollslayer> it's still pretty funny
<fluttercry> 05,15I can understand that. That does suck
<texasboykc09> NocturnalBlade: hello
<emantrollslayer> if only you guys had me around to slay them
<LT_SKINNY> wb NocturnalBlade
<Buytoast> excitement was made to be crushed by dissapointment
<Soulless_DCLXVI> A little bit, now. But at the time I was bloody LIVID.
<AJIsAwesome> As a hijack attempt, it was funny. But as a LIVESTREAM hijack, it was annoying.
*emantrollslayer slices up a statue of RAWRity
<texasboykc09> ^^
<LT_SKINNY> emantrollslayer: you mean business... 0.0
<fluttercry> 05,15I hate how it wasn't even our fault, it was mips, yet people think it was ours
<texasboykc09> fluttercry: ikr
<OneTrickPony> wait what happened?
<Shizuka> 13OMFG BRONYSTAET GOT HAXXORED WHAT NOOBS
<AJIsAwesome> OneTrickPony: Mips got hijacked.
<OneTrickPony> wat how?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I don't know who mips is, but I only blame the attackers. Not the defenders.
<emantrollslayer> Shizuka IDK MY BFF JILL
<Shizuka> 13mips sucks at security
<AJIsAwesome> Security hole, I think?
<Shizuka> 13therefore we haven't used them in weeks
<OneTrickPony> oh
<XAX> TOTALLY WASN'T THE PROVIDERS FAULT THERE MUST BE AN INSIDER LEAKING THE EMBED TO THE GNAA FIJSLAFJSAF
<SillyFilly64> 11,02I'M UNSUBSCRIBING IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN
<fluttercry> 05,15Mips was our streaming service, then we found out they are awful
<Shizuka> 13WHY IS IT DIFFERENT
<fluttercry> 05,15I DON'T LIKE DIFFERENT
<LT_SKINNY> wat, did they use a MSOD attack or somethin?
<OneTrickPony> what was streamed?
<emantrollslayer> IDK MY BFF ROSE
<Shizuka> 13DIFFERENT BAD
<Buytoast> because mips is as secure as a thin blanket on a giant fan
<emantrollslayer> inb4 Rose` wakes up in her sleep
<Shizuka> 13LT_SKINNY: Mips publishes one of the two secret keys needed to broadcast right in the player embed
<LT_SKINNY> Shizuka: Thats... slightly retarded
<Shizuka> 13yes it is
<XAX> Shizuka: So how get second one?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> For all those talking about "different". This is what you made me think of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgIrXKpv2gw
<fluttercry> 05,15pffft Family Guy
<Shizuka> 13XAX: the twit that did it was in possession of some exploit to get the other half of the key
<Shizuka> 13but only for mips
<XAX> Shizuka: l33t
<SillyFilly64> 11,02SHHHHHHHHH
<fluttercry> 05,15Soulless_DCLXVI this if for pros
<fluttercry> 05,15http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mgDiCnYjog&feature=youtu.be
<SillyFilly64> 11,02Sasha is asleep
<Shizuka> 13all the other embeds aren't as hilariously stupid
<texasboykc09> ^
<Shizuka> 13and ustream autoplays, so we like them
<LT_SKINNY> As I said, retarded exploit is retarded...
<texasboykc09> Shizuka: it also plays on ios divces
<SillyFilly64> 11,02Weird how having a U in the name of something makes everything better...
<XAX> and then he blamed /v/ and everyone went and went all YOU STOP MUH PONY on them
<Soulless_DCLXVI> That was funny.
<Shizuka> 13in the end it was actually some loser who just wanted people to watch his stream instead
<SillyFilly64> 11,02pls
<XAX> lol
<Shizuka> 13how pathetic do you get
<SillyFilly64> 11,02I'm a Professional Moderator.
<fluttercry> 05,15./v/ is too busy arguing with themselves over Vidya Games to hack
<LT_SKINNY> Shizuka: Welcome to the Internet.
<fluttercry> 05,15also yeah, just someone wanting traffic
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Yeah, I'm gonna be honest. I totally fell for the /v/ line.
<XAX> fluttercry: >implying /v/ plays vidya gaems and don't just LE SHITPOST XD
<emantrollslayer> SillyFilly64 the most pro 1337 mod since ever
<Shizuka> 13sb, jokes from mod chat do not really translate well to mane chat without context
<fluttercry> 05,15XAX they TRY to have vidya
<fluttercry> 05,15....try
<XAX> measly attempt
<emantrollslayer> bitch please
<XAX> It usually just degrades to Back2Reddit as far as I ever saw.
<LT_SKINNY> 'tis a flesh wound!
<fluttercry> 05,15All the cool kids hang out at Giant Bomb for vidya
*emantrollslayer brushes the spagetti out of his face
<Yahooz> Shizuka: nor do regular jokes
<SillyFilly64> 11,02Shizuka: It was a big thing on Twitter today :o
<XAX> thought /mlp/ is the same. as soon as someone comes in acting all typical brony, "back to ponychan pls".
<XAX> SillyFilly64: I followed you :3
<SillyFilly64> 11,02XAX: Yay :3
<emantrollslayer> XAX get on my level
<emantrollslayer> I stalk SillyFilly64
*SillyFilly64 hugs XAX
<fluttercry> 05,15./mlp/ is too busy trying to make Tulpas to actually have a discussion
<Buytoast> everyone always talks about that Twipper thing
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Wait, /mlp/ doesn't like bronies? Odd.
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Tulpas?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I'll never understand 4chan....
<SillyFilly64> 11,02I think
<emantrollslayer> fluttercry I have to admit, the /mlh/ threads can be funny as hell sometimes
<SillyFilly64> 11,02and correct me if I'm wrong
<Buytoast> psh, /mlp/ only likes two things
<SillyFilly64> 11,02But in my personal opinion
<Buytoast> tulpas and horse porn
<Hanako> /mlp/ doesn't need a period at the beginning
<XAX> fluttercry: as far as i can tell, if you want discussion, MLPG threads are where it's at.
<Shizuka> 13twitter is for people whose thoughts don't exceed 140 characters
<fluttercry> 05,15So, perfect for ADD teenagers
<NullRadix> Shizuka: ouch
<SillyFilly64> 11,02There is a group of people who like MLP who are known as Bronies and those who hate the show who are known as Anti-Bronies.
<Yahooz> Shizuka but you have a twitter though...
<Shizuka> 13and see how much use it gets?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Go on....
<CTHULHU> @Shizuka: i agree.
<Yahooz> ...not much :/
<SillyFilly64> 11,02You have a Twitter? D:
<LT_SKINNY> So... Twitter is for short-minded people? :P
<Buytoast> hell, i only have one of those facebook things and it only gets updated about once in a blue moon
<Shizuka> 13i think i last tweeted... two years ago?
<XAX> Yeah, twitter is for short minded people. Eg: mandopony.
<fluttercry> 05,15I only tweet about cool stuff. Like Gyrobowls
<KrazyNoobs> Hey, BronyState. I just came from /mlp/, so I am going to have to try hard to behave (which I will).
<CTHULHU> i dont got a twitter and im glad.
<Yahooz> fluttercry: AMEN
<XAX> KrazyNoobs: "hi guys im le new ill be good promis XD"
<Yahooz> fluttercry: did you see those biblical spoofs i did for Gyrobowl?
<KrazyNoobs> I have been here for 6 weeks
*emantrollslayer watches the spaghetti pour out of KrazyNoobs's pockets
<XAX> KrazyNoobs: I browse that board daily, yet I don't need to announce that i'm gonna try control myself.
<LT_SKINNY> Ive been here for only three... Im so vet :D
<texasboykc09> hello KrazyNoobs

<Soulless_DCLXVI> You shall burn in the lake of boiling pasta sauce for your heresy.
<OneTrickPony> Cage is the god of gods
<OneTrickPony> he claims all religions
<NocturnalBlade> I thought Wesker was the only god?

<twilight_squirtle> adrian brody is also demigod tier
<CTHULHU> and im his.

<Yahooz> I love it when people call Sumi a she
<Yahooz> oh the hilarity
<OneTrickPony> Yahooz: XD
<fluttercry> 05,15People constantly think I'm a she
<AJIsAwesome> Yahooz: Well, the OC could bring up the said question.
<LT_SKINNY> This newfoal wishes to learn so he doesnt make a constant ass of himself xD
<emantrollslayer> fluttercry YOU'RE NOT A SHEEEEEEEEE????????? ....shocking

<Trollestia> making sure I don't lose this nick
<Cypresswolf> not very efficient, ended up staying up the rest of the night, sleeping during lunch hour, end up hungry all day - I was a train wreck
<XAX> nah, people just think sumi is a girl because OCs clearly indicate gender.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Honestly, I assume everyone's male until proven otherwise.
<AJIsAwesome> LT_SKINNY: No problem. :)
<Yahooz> emantrollslayer: i saw him at bronycon. pretty convincing if you ask me

<NocturnalBlade> Whatever a person's name looks and sounds like to me is what gender i assume they are until i'm told otherwise lol
<LT_SKINNY> How necessary is registering a name like mine?
<Shizuka> 13so i attached it to my alt for safekeeping
<Yahooz> Shizuka: ah, setting up shop then
<AJIsAwesome> LT_SKINNY: So that people don't use your name.
<NullRadix> LT_SKINNY: depends entirely on how paranoid you are
<AJIsAwesome> LT_SKINNY: To impersonate you.

<fluttercry> 05,15I worked hard on those
<NocturnalBlade> XAX: not bad...my tag on Halo 4 is BRNY lol

<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Is it the boopinest?
<fluttercry> 05,15It is
<XAX> NocturnalBlade: my tag on bo2 is [pone]
<fluttercry> 05,15Also I came across a guy the other night with the name "I kill Bronies"
<XAX> as you saw
*OneTrickPony wants BL2
<Cypresswolf> 2 lbs ground beef, worchester sauce, spice mix, 2 cans of chili, black beans, potatoes, stewed tomatoes, carrots, celery and onions ^_^ could eat that the rest of the week
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: :D
<fluttercry> 05,15He....didn't last long
<NocturnalBlade> XAX: eeyup
<sub06905> fluttercry: lel
<NocturnalBlade> fluttercry: wow really :D
<AJIsAwesome> Makes sense why he didn't.
<XAX> fluttercry: >tfw most bronies i see on BO2 play badly
<XAX> ;_;
<Cypresswolf> perhaps a whisky marinade this time :O
<sub06905> hmm.. still debating on getting blops 2
<fluttercry> 05,15I pretty much refuse to play without a full team, or at least 4 people. Luckily the people I roll with are always online
<NocturnalBlade> XAX: i kinda want black ops 2...i still think i would do bad though lol
*OneTrickPony can't wait till BF4
<NocturnalBlade> fluttercry: thats the best way lol
*sub06905 is still enjoying BF3
<OneTrickPony> ^
<Soulless_DCLXVI> The only game I'm looking forward to is GTA V.
<XAX> i usually play arone in random lobbies with no friends
<XAX> i still have fun
<fluttercry> 05,15I enjoyed BF3 until I reached the max rank and unlocked everything I wanted
<OneTrickPony> COD needs a new engine
<XAX> but id probably have more with my friends
<XAX> OneTrickPony: BO2 had a lot added to the engine, graphically. HDR lighting, DX11 support, etc
<sub06905> yea bf3 can get a bit dull once you have everything
<sub06905> :I
<fluttercry> 05,15Over the winter break I plan on finally beating XCOM
<XAX> they even added Havok physics to the engine
<OneTrickPony> XAX: oh
<Cypresswolf> my stew pot is in the sink...it'll have to wait...
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm going to name all my soldiers after the MST3K Space Mutiny names
<Shizuka> 13gentlemen

<Shizuka> 13i would link the first six minutes of rebuild 3.0 but do not want to spoil
<Shizuka> 13suffice to say
<Shizuka> 13hot shit :D
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, it's pretty epic from the start.
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm only on like...episode 5 of Evangelion but so far I really like it
<OneTrickPony> Shizuka: is there any place I can watch Evangelion 3.0 for free?
<Shizuka> 13not yet
<OneTrickPony> oh
<Shizuka> 13camrips are leaking very very slowly at horrible quality
<Shizuka> 13DVD will land in the states sometime next year
<LT_SKINNY> back

<OneTrickPony> well, ill be looking forward to that
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, LT_SKINNY. :)
<OneTrickPony> wb LT_SKINNY
<fluttercry> 05,15Even though things are okay now, I get this sinking feeling that by the end of the series I'm going to feel like I got punched in the guy
<fluttercry> 05,15gut*
<LT_SKINNY> Thanks all :P
<Shizuka> 13very much so
<fluttercry> 05,15it's giving off those vibes
<NocturnalBlade> Soooo...i started playing WoW again XD
<Soulless_DCLXVI> What's giving off those vibes?
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: You'll see.
<NullRadix> NocturnalBlade: sounds like a cry for help. When would you like your intervention?
<Kurra> raa.
<Shizuka> 13if you listen to that video, you'll see the kind of energy it releases
<KrazyNoobs> meep
*Kurra as arrived in the middle of something o.o
<Sliverfish> MEEP
<AJIsAwesome> Interesting enough, NGE was one of the first animes I watched when I got back into anime.
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, Kurra. :)
<NocturnalBlade> NullRadix: no, just happens everytime there is a new race lol nothing to big to worry about ^_^
<Kurra> hihi
<NocturnalBlade> hi Kurra
<LT_SKINNY> Hey Kurra
<texasboykc09> hello Kurra
<Shizuka> 13now if only this track was on youtube anywhere....
<OneTrickPony> I got into anime through Angel Beats
<XAX> the reason i have a rarity emblem on BO2 is because i unlocked the diamond camo for the snipers, and i thought it'd look cool on the side.
<XAX> .-.
<KrazyNoobs> Don't worry, meep is just what people who miss g-- will substitute for a new meme, although they are failing miserably.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> LOVED Angel Beats
<fluttercry> 05,15http://cdn.themis-media.com/media/global/images/library/deriv/106/106133.jpg
<fluttercry> 05,15I saw this earlier and it made me lol
<OneTrickPony> hai Kurra
<Sliverfish> MEEPMEEPMEEP
<Hanako> I only watch moeshit
<Kurra> hihi OneTrickPony
<OneTrickPony> Soulless_DCLXVI: it was really good, but I wish it was longer
<KrazyNoobs> G-- is back on December the 14th to THe Hub, AND IT'S OFFICIAL
<LT_SKINNY> I think my first anime was Sailor Moon via Toonami... good times haha
<Shizuka> 13ah sailor moon
<Shizuka> 13the DIC dub
<AJIsAwesome> I loved Angel Beats as well.
<fluttercry> 05,15I never watched Sailor Moon
<Hanako> upotte
<LT_SKINNY> Shizuka: affirmative :D
<Hanako> and strike witches
<KrazyNoobs> The chatroom is going to break during Season 3 Episode 7 because of ---'s trumphiant return
<Hanako> and lucky star
<Hanako> come the fuck at me
<AJIsAwesome> First anime I ever watched was Dragonball, if I recall.
<fluttercry> 05,15and my first anime was Yu-Yu-Hakusho followed by Cowboy Bebop
<KrazyNoobs> First anime for me was Pokemon
<Kurra> do i detect spoilar |u
<KrazyNoobs> I was 4
<OneTrickPony> I just finished Gunslinger Girl and that was pretty good
<texasboykc09> KrazyNoobs: and wrek will go crazy
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, I LOVED Yu-Yu-Hakisho.
<Kurra> u|
<Kurra> |u
<NocturnalBlade> :O Yu-yu-Hakisho, loved it lol
<LT_SKINNY> Good, I miss being 6 :'(
<Kurra> :v
<LT_SKINNY> God*
<fluttercry> 05,15Then I stopped watching anime for years. Been trying to get back into it for a while now
<Kurra> >8v....
<KrazyNoobs> texasboykc09 Only on #BronyState, that word is banned. On all the 6 rooms that unlock during the new episode, you can say --- as much as you want. :)
<Soulless_DCLXVI> That Critical Miss comic was funny.
<Hanako> oh fuck
<texasboykc09> KrazyNoobs: unless Wrek is in it
<fluttercry> 05,15I need more giant robots
<Hanako> OneTrickPony: Yes, gunslinger girl
<Hanako> how could I forget that
<Hanako> also baccano
<CTHULHU> first anime i watched was sailor moon.
<OneTrickPony> Hanako: yea, it was interesting
<Shizuka> 13oh wait what am i doing, i should be audiosurfing this track
<NocturnalBlade> CTHULHU: i think that was the same for me
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Anyone else here dislike watching dubbed anime?
<LT_SKINNY> CTHULHU: Glad to hear Im not the only one :P
<fluttercry> 05,15Cowboy Bebop is one of those anime that's actually better dubbed if you ask me
<Shizuka> 13same with ghost in the shell
<Kurra> i think so too.
<Hanako> hah
<AJIsAwesome> I still need to watch Nichijou, that show is cute. :D
<Kurra> yes.
<Hanako> better and dubbed don't work
<Hanako> together
<Shizuka> 13you haven't heard bebop or GITS then
<Hanako> GITS and Cowboy Bebop <3
<NocturnalBlade> ^
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<fluttercry> 05,15Cowboy Bebop is better dubbed. The charaters just make more sense
<fluttercry> 05,15Same with Black Lagoon
<Hanako> Nichijou looks good
<LT_SKINNY> I dont mind reading subs... as long as theyre in MY language
<Hanako> wait
<Hanako> are we assuming official subs
<Hanako> or fansubs
<NocturnalBlade> fluttercry: i've only seen CB dubbed lol
<Hanako> huge difference
<texasboykc09> ^^^^^
<CTHULHU> the first mange i read was chobits.
<Hanako> I often prefer dubs over official subs
<XAX> http://derpy.me/BTi7K the sun is getting larger
<fluttercry> 05,15Evangelion I don't know what to do. I've seen the dub, and I like it, but I haven't given the sub a try
<AJIsAwesome> Was anyone here when Sumica streamed that one anime where in order to upgrade to higher classes they needed to beat other teams?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Really, Skinny? And here I thought reading subs you couldn't understand just ENRICHED the whole anime experience...
<LT_SKINNY> Hanako: um... Id do research on which one is more reputable to the source material
<KrazyNoobs> Boondocks. Nuff said
<fluttercry> 05,15same with Gurren Lagann
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: For Eva and Gurren, I'd recommend the subs.
<Hanako> LT_SKINNY: A good fansub is invariably more reliable
<OneTrickPony> I dont like subs cause it takes my eyes off of what is actually happening
<LT_SKINNY> Hanako: Thats good to hear :)
<fluttercry> 05,15I liked that one about ghosts that they when they dubbed it, they changed it and turned it into a comedy
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome: i remember that lol it was funny ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind subs because I can read and look at what's happening at the same time.
<CTHULHU> XAX: i dont think its the sun thatsgetting biger.
<fluttercry> 05,15also, they need to hurry up and dub the Persona 4 anime.
<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: Do you recall the name?
<Cypresswolf> I'd like to see Paranoi Agent again - that was a good psycological thriller - virtually impossible to find since Geneon went bust
<fluttercry> 05,15Because that's how I know those characters
<XAX> CTHULHU: thatsthejoke.png
<LT_SKINNY> I just cant stand the monotone English VA's... piss me off real bad at some points :/
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I vastly prefer subs. Most dubbed acting is SHIT.
<OneTrickPony> I want to learn Japenese so I wont need dubs or subs
<LT_SKINNY> ^
<Hanako> I'm not enough of a weaboo
<Hanako> not dedicated enough
<fluttercry> 05,15Good luck. you need like over 2000 hours to become even somewhat proficient
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome: Baka to Test to Shōkanjū: Ni! yay for google lol
<Hanako> oh fuck I forgot railgun and index
<OneTrickPony> Bu dui
<Hanako> watch both of those
<LT_SKINNY> Im bilingual in Spanish, so I can give it a shot :)
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks, NocturnalBlade. :)
<NocturnalBlade> no prob lol
<OneTrickPony> I am learning Chinese right now, so close enough
<Hanako> ...I am in a brony chat discussing animu
<fluttercry> 05,15Mandarin or Cantonese?
*Hanako has lost control of her life
<OneTrickPony> Mandarin
<fluttercry> 05,15Cantonese is clearly the correct answer
<OneTrickPony> no
<fluttercry> 05,15Because Hong Kong is best pony
<OneTrickPony> lol
<LT_SKINNY> Hanako: Welcome to the herd :P
<Hanako> nonono
<Hanako> I was a brony once
<Hanako> no longer
<AJIsAwesome> Hanako: That depends. Have you made any chocolate pudding?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Then why are you here?
<OneTrickPony> ^
<AJIsAwesome> Soulless_DCLXVI: Not everyone here's a brony.
<OneTrickPony> oh
<Hanako> because I still have friends on this network
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Really? That's... counter intuitive.
<Hanako> AJIsAwesome: I did that the first time I was here at exactly 4:00
<OneTrickPony> I have never thought of that
<fluttercry> 05,15Why are you making chocolate pudding?
<LT_SKINNY> Meh, we are what we are, so I dont give any mind to it
<Hanako> it was the S2 premiere
<Soulless_DCLXVI> That makes sense I guess.
<fluttercry> 05,15Did you lose control of your life?
<AJIsAwesome> Soulless_DCLXVI: Some people come here for the random streams and movies.
<Hanako> I did in fact
<Cypresswolf> :3 was a time a man could cook at 4 am without losing control
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Well, at least I can take solace in the fact that most here are bronies. And I doubt anyone here is a hater.
<LT_SKINNY> ^
<Cypresswolf> I dont know when that was, myself
<Hanako> "bronies" get on my fucking nerves sometimes
<Soulless_DCLXVI> :(
<Hanako> but meh, don't hate the show or the fans or anything
<CTHULHU> how?
<fluttercry> 05,15One of my closest brony friends actually started out as a hate
<fluttercry> 05,15hater*
<AJIsAwesome> Hanako: That's understadable, if I can picture what you mean.
<Shizuka> 13ugh they ruined the dawn theme...
<AJIsAwesome> *understandable
<fluttercry> 05,15he HATED MLP and everything about it. Then he saw Pinkie Pie
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Who?
<Shizuka> 13oh god they ruined this so hard...
<Kurra> ninight all :>
<Shizuka> 13right... well anyway
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Kurra. :)
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I started out as a hater. Sort of. I thought my brony friend was alone in his appreciation of the show and was just weird as hell.
<AJIsAwesome> Sleep well!
<Hanako> AJIsAwesome: LOVE AND TOLERATE, HATE IS FORBIDDEN, HAY GUIS LOOK AT MY DERPY SHIRT
<LT_SKINNY> fluttercry: Pinkie Pie is best converter :O
*Kurra pulls all the snuggly creatures in to the barn fulla hay
<OneTrickPony> night Kurra
<AJIsAwesome> Hanako: Yep, that's understandable.
<XAX> fluttercry: i know someone like that. But how did just seeing a character change them?
<LT_SKINNY> g'night Kurra :)
<ponynest> cx
<Shizuka> 13http://retracked.org/disk2.html get this, and listen to the Underwater World track
<AJIsAwesome> I don't let that stuff affect me, though.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Now I'm a fanfiction author. Not a good one, but an author nonetheless.
<ponynest> ninight LT_SKINNY :D
<fluttercry> 05,15XAX he saw a clip of something on youtube
<Shizuka> 13also Ice Frontier is pretty well remixed, Lavender Hill not as much
<XAX> ah.
<CTHULHU> igot one real brony frind in rl.
<AJIsAwesome> I have a few brony friends in real life.
<fluttercry> 05,15I have 2 and a half
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Half?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I got.. two. I turned 'em myself. The one who turned me was an Xbox LIVE firend. One known for being weird.
<Shizuka> 13i remember having friends
<fluttercry> 05,15half
<CTHULHU> and i got one heater friend.
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Wait, I think I see what you mean.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> That sucks, Shizuka
<fluttercry> 05,15as in he likes the show but he hasn't watched it since S2
<CTHULHU> hater*
<fluttercry> 05,15but if you turn an episode on, he'll watch it
<Jmo> Friends are over-rated.
<LT_SKINNY> I havent had friends since high school lol
<Cypresswolf> ^
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<fluttercry> 05,15All my friends are the ones from high school. I haven't made any in college
<KrazyNoobs> My brother is a huge hater. He got me banned from here twice by writing disgusting stuff about "how he loves PokemoN"
<AJIsAwesome> I'm trying to make some friends in college atm.
<Arcium> Good Morning ^^
<LT_SKINNY> thats good :)
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome: same ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Arcium. :)
<NocturnalBlade> morning Arcium
<LT_SKINNY> and good morning Arcium
<PonyNegZero> My college's official (recognized by the university) is somewhere around 25 or something
<CTHULHU> i cant make new friends.
<Arcium> :D
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Jmo, really? But don't you that *sharp intake of breath, deep condescending voice with occasional voice crack* FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC
<fluttercry> 05,15Then again I'm at a community college soooooooooooo I haven't really been the most talkative person
<KrazyNoobs> My brother also drew pe----s on my brony shirts with perm marker. My parents made him buy me new ones, so it ended well, as I was getting big for those shirts anyway. I GOT NEW SIZES!!! :D
<texasboykc09> morning Arcium
<Jmo> You missed 'know'
<Soulless_DCLXVI> .....damnit
<Arcium> KrazyNoobs: lucky you :D
<NocturnalBlade> nice KrazyNoobs lol
<texasboykc09> KrazyNoobs: epic win for you
<LT_SKINNY> KrazyNoobs: Thats a good story there :P
<KrazyNoobs> He also payed from the shipping from WeLoveFine.com to Australia
<KrazyNoobs> So it was a good ending
<Soulless_DCLXVI> HA
<Cypresswolf> I rarely talk to anyone, coworkers get a bit of conversation from me, but thats it
<Arcium> :D
<Arcium> Cypresswolf: :P
<fluttercry> 05,15I miss my old job. I worked at an ice cream stand
<fluttercry> 05,15best job ever
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I bet
<LT_SKINNY> Most of the nerds that congregate amongst themselves at my college are haters... I feel so alone :(
<Arcium> Fluttercry: What job do you have now then?
<KrazyNoobs> But that made him hate ponies even more, so now I have a ridiculously long password on my computer he could never get so that he will never go onto my account here and f--- around with everypony again. As said, I almost got perma-banned.
<fluttercry> 05,15It taught me valuable skills like.....making milkshakes and.....scooping ice creams
<KrazyNoobs> FIRE!!!
<NocturnalBlade> :O fireplace ^_^ so warm
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Hate nerds? That's ass backwards...
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Hater*

<Shizuka> 13maxed out sound meter on fmle makes me worried..
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I mean, there's fire... EVERYWHERE.. okay, getting tired of using caps. How do you italics?
<Shizuka> 13but i guess being line 1 it doesn't run into clipping issues
<AJIsAwesome> Soulless_DCLXVI: Type /me, and then what you want to say.
*Shizuka 13if by italics you mean ctcp action, /me
<XAX> So fluttercry. What time is it?

<texasboykc09> Shizuka: why did you start streaming out of nowhere
*Soulless_DCLXVI test me/ test
<Hanako> But I prefer to do *this*
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Damn it
<fluttercry> 05,15Shizuka you have to watch out! In one hour the Earth wil----
<AJIsAwesome> texasboykc09: Why not? :3
<Cypresswolf> Is it friday in the world of tomorrow?
<LT_SKINNY> Do you have flying cars yet?
<Hanako> Soulless_DCLXVI: /me isn't what you want
<Shizuka> 13i have to share how awesome this remix is
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Now way of italicing only PART of a sentence, eh?
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<Arcium> Bye every bode :D Schooltime -.-

<fluttercry> 05,15can't have fire in an apartment
<KrazyNoobs> bye bye arcium
<Hanako> /this/
<Shizuka> 13some clients interpret /this/ as italics but it depends on the client
<fluttercry> 05,15well you CAN but it doesn't end well
<Shizuka> 13lightIRC does not
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Still not working, buddy.
*fluttercry why are we talking about italics?
<Shizuka> 13other clients interpret *bold* or _underline_
<AJIsAwesome> I just see it as a slash on lightiRC.
<KrazyNoobs> When was BronyState made again?
*LT_SKINNY because they look cool
<Shizuka> 13it has always existed
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Because I don't want to use caps all the time to emphasize.
<Shizuka> 13okay i have to share how awesome this mix is
<Hanako> *This* is emphasis, I generally use it instead of italics
<KrazyNoobs> Shizuka LOL, I just found the About Us History pages
<fluttercry> 05,15KrazyNoobs gosh....I wanna say.....March of 2011. I may be wrong
<KrazyNoobs> I'll check
<Hanako> Soulless_DCLXVI: Would *this* suit your purposes?
<Shizuka> 13so sounds pretty lo fi right, early tracker music?
<KrazyNoobs> fluttercry May of 2011
<fluttercry> 05,15Is this the 80s?
<LT_SKINNY> Agreed
<Shizuka> 13okay
<AJIsAwesome> I think May 2011, right?
<Shizuka> 13now behold
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Eh, I guess. Italics would be better. But i'll take what I can get.
<fluttercry> 05,15KrazyNoobs I knew it was one of those m months
<fluttercry> 05,15Am I living in Drive?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I usually use *this* for roleplay purposes.
<Shizuka> 13DAT BASS HIT
*KrazyNoobs is reading about BronyState's history, rather interested
<Cypresswolf> I'd maim to have dirt floor in the living room with a fire pit in the center! fireplaces are over rated! Just have a shielded grate for the smoke to bellow out above when the fire is going
<fluttercry> 05,15Worthy of Phill Collins
<LT_SKINNY> Vinyl would be proud, Shizuka
<fluttercry> 05,15Okay yeah this is giving off some serious "Drive" vibes
<Hanako> Oh
*Hanako uses this for roleplay
<KrazyNoobs> Why would so many of the original admins leave from this awesome part of the brony community?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Drive... that one TV show with Nathon Fillion?
<fluttercry> 05,15I use the kick boot for RP
<Soulless_DCLXVI> (I doubt I got his name right)
<Hanako> oh you
<fluttercry> 05,15Soulless_DCLXVI nah it's a crime movie with Ryan Gosling
<Hanako> mhm
<texasboykc09> Shizuka: what is Ninja-ing
<Hanako> I left for most of S2
<AJIsAwesome> KrazyNoobs: RL problems or duties, I guess?
<Hanako> when I came back I didn't recognize folks
<fluttercry> 05,15Also sounds a lot like Hotline Miami
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Ah, and surpisingly I got his *first* name wrong, but his *last* name right.
<Shizuka> 13DAT SOLO
<AJIsAwesome> Well, that's what happens when you're gone for a long time. :D
<KrazyNoobs> AJIsAwesome: The History page said that they left to continue other work in the brony community...
<Cypresswolf> Actually, have all the rooms with a dirt floor - why waste money on carpet or tile? If dirt floors was good enough for the pioneers, its good enough for me
<AJIsAwesome> KrazyNoobs: Not all of them.
<OneTrickPony> Im gonna go to sleep now see ya guys later ^_^
<LT_SKINNY> Thats like me now... I try really hard to invest myself in this fanbase, but life makes it so difficult.
<KrazyNoobs> AJIsAwesome from what I have read, SuperBrony64 is the admin that has remained on BronyState for the longest amount of time
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Has Silverscreen retired from being a mod here or is he on indefinite hiatus?
<Shizuka> 13no

<AJIsAwesome> otakon: No Mahjong?
<otakon> I can be random
<RaveBrony> Scrabble is fun :D
<NocturnalBlade> ^
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: I don't even think she knows how to play it
<AJIsAwesome> Can't be a game night without Mahjong. :D
<Soulless_DCLXVI> My mom kick my *ass* at Scrabble and pretty much every other word game imaginable.
<otakon> anyway I lost my taste for Scrabble after my sister beat me with QUAY

<Soulless_DCLXVI> Once, the letter was G and one of the catergories was Music Band. My dad wrote "Gorrilas" thinking he was being funny and writing the wrong name for a band called "The Monkeys". When I said "I'm surprised you know the band, but that's supposed to be a Z, he got confused.

<Soulless_DCLXVI> Chrysalis please let me never see that in art form.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I'd be traumatized.
<otakon> Shizuka: ?? why is it my fault?
<AppleBloom> well I got work in the morning, G'night everypony

*RaveBrony runs off to youtube
<Chrysalis> have you heard the new tombstone?
<Shizuka> 13it's always the exact same percussion pattern
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Wait, I hear a slow Japanese song. Not a Eurobeat Babs seed remix. Do I need to refresh?
<AJIsAwesome> Soulless_DCLXVI: Eurobeat's on Youtube.
<Chrysalis> Soulless_DCLXVI nope
<RaveBrony> Ooo, im liking it so far <3
<Chrysalis> im just bein YT hipster watchin the vids before they get popular

<Chrysalis> ALL HAIL GAK
<AJIsAwesome> Gah, I hate it when my chat crashes.
<RaveBrony> Hah
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Billy mays is gonna kick yo ass.
<twilight_squirtle> well im listening to the eva 3.0 ost, and judging by the songs, rule number 1 of eva will be well preserved, there seems to be more "we're screwed"/"worlds about to end" music than battle music even
<Soulless_DCLXVI> We still got about a week and a half before that music becomes relevant.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I am of course referring to the Dec 21 2012 bullcrap
<otakon> oh that
<otakon> I heard it's happening the 12th
<otakon> you know, 12/12/12 and all that crap
<AJIsAwesome> I thought it was the 21st.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Nah, man. Winter Solstice.
<otakon> bah it's rubbish
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Yeah, the 21st.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Of course it is.
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, otakon.
<otakon> it's rubbish regardless
<Soulless_DCLXVI> But I've been hearing about this date since '99.
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Where did you find this? :D
<twilight_squirtle> wait, the world is ending 12/12/12? damn, i already bought a bus ticket...
<otakon> lol
<twilight_squirtle> the ticket for that day i mean
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I almost wish something would happen. All that build up....
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hi
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, aniderp|bestcakeever.
<twilight_squirtle> hoi aniderp|bestcakeever
<otakon> okay I hate the NEW NEW Youtube layour
<otakon> *layout
<Soulless_DCLXVI> 'Sup, aniderp|bestcakeever
<Sumica> 00,10what build up? the wack a doos telling you the world is ending cause some one ran out of space on their calinder?
<otakon> all I want is to see my Subscriptions Uploads in my feed
<otakon> THAT'S IT
<otakon> WHY DOES IT KEEP SHOWING MY "What to Watch" and everything else BESIDES THAT?
<AJIsAwesome> Fresh Prince? :D
<otakon> View 276
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Man, I've been hearing about this ONE SPECIFIC DATE, since 1999. No other date have I heard so much about, for so long.
<otakon> hah
<Buytoast> it's all bullshit son
<otakon> Soulless_DCLXVI: what? not even the Y2K bug?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> OBVIOUSLY
<Shizuka> 13except those predictions don't take the gregorian calendar's modifications into account
<Shizuka> 13the mayan calendar rolled over in like 2006
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Man, I heard about Y2K in 1999. That's only one year of build up
<otakon> Shizuka: so... bullocks?
<otakon> ahem bollocks?
<Shizuka> 13eeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Not even, I think I heard about Y2K in October
<otakon> DAMN YOU EXHAUSTION!
<otakon> I DON'T WANT TO GO TO BED!
*Bigcheese brings up Y2038
<twilight_squirtle> 12/12/12 is the date of gaк rapture, accept your lord and you will live
<otakon> lol
<Kandarihu> twilight_squirtle, the date is supposedly 12/21/12. And as Sumica pointed out, there's really nothing to it other than the Mayan calander running out of space.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Bigcheese don't you even start dude.
<Bigcheese> It's a real problem.
<Buytoast> the hell is Y2038?
<otakon> good question
<Shizuka> 13yeah 2038 is the big actual problem
<Bigcheese> Buytoast: when the unix time stamp overflows.
<Shizuka> 13the 32bit unix timestamp overflow
<twilight_squirtle> Kandarihu: oh its 21, i guess my bus ticket for the 12th wont go to waste then
<CTHULHU> love this song
<Bigcheese> Y2k was only a problem for crappy systems.
<Sumica> 00,10piffff unix
<otakon> Shizuka: so what does that mean?
<otakon> crap
<Bigcheese> That only crappy people used in 2000.
<Sumica> 00,10it's not like we need to lock to door in a hury
<otakon> only 26 years before that
<oni_link> Hey everyone! Feels like its been forever since I was last here
<Shizuka> 13uh every system in the world that uses unix timestamps needs to be using the 64bit version by then
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Actually, the Mayan Calendar is one of like 100 "prophecies". Of course they're all bullocks. But that don't change that I've had the date drilled into my head for 13 years.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, oni_link. :)
<Bigcheese> The 2038 problem is deeply embedded in protocols.
<otakon> hiya oni_link we're talking about DOOMSDAYS!
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: howdy!
<otakon> Soulless_DCLXVI: bollocks, a bullock is a young bull
<oni_link> otakon: oh goody :3
<AdamTheDuck_> Ohai oni_link :P
<oni_link> hey AdamTheDuck_ ! :)
<Bigcheese> And all 32bit code uses 32bit time by default.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I think before that the longest I had thought about a date in the future was Halo: Reach's release date.
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: What song is this? :)
<Kandarihu> Before Y2038, we have to deal with the Fiscal Cliff and Solar Maximum. That's gonna be this next year.
<Shizuka> 13lilium
<Shizuka> 13elfen lied OP
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Thanks otakon
<AJIsAwesome> Alright thanks. :)
<Bigcheese> elfen lied is AWESOME.
<Bigcheese> But back to the point.
<Shizuka> 13i doubt even late night mane chat is mature enough for elfen lied
<Bigcheese> We need 64bit miliseconds.
<oni_link> whoa haha
<Bigcheese> 300k years
<oni_link> I always see that on my netflix queue
<Bigcheese> And milisecond accuracy.
<Shizuka> 13much much longer than that
<otakon> Shizuka: I'm too exhausted for that can of worms
<Shizuka> 13300 million
<Bigcheese> Shizuka: must have been nanoseconds I was thinking of then.
<Shizuka> 13like 297,000,000 plus change
<otakon> okay the HELL is Solar Maximum?
<Sumica> 00,10whats the worst that could happen Shizuka
<Bigcheese> otakon: when the sun kills everyone!!!!!!
<Soulless_DCLXVI> No clue
<Bigcheese> Shizuka: the universe goes back to 1970
<Shizuka> 13for 32 bit time overflow? all systems still using 32bit timestamp will think it's 1900
<otakon> Bigcheese: yay... well that's not supposed to happen for about 3 billion years
<Sumica> 00,10no I ment if you showed Elfin
<Shizuka> 13oh elfen lied?
<Bigcheese> Shizuka: nipples!
<Shizuka> 13one of the characters has a stepfather that rapes her
<otakon> Sumica: Chat freaks out, and we all go to bed whimpering
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: .......
<Shizuka> 13did i mention the character is no more than ten?
<Bigcheese> That too.
<otakon> Shizuka: THE TABOO!
<Shizuka> 13she runs away and that's the important part of the arc
<Sumica> 00,10oh is that all
<AJIsAwesome> Wow. :S
<oni_link> well shit. okay
<otakon> Sumica: no, that's the PROLOGUE
<Soulless_DCLXVI> So.. Bigcheese... in 3 billion years the universe will revert to 1970CE?
<Bigcheese> Shizuka: which girl is that...
<Shizuka> 13no the prologue is
<Bigcheese> I totally forget.
<Kandarihu> We have 26 years to deal with it. If Solar Maximum does blast the whole world to the stone age, I can probably guess we'll wait until the last 3 years before we take it seriously, and it'll be just like Y2K all over again.
<Shizuka> 13the first six minutes are a naked girl utterly destroying high ranking military
<Bigcheese> The prologue is a naked girl walking around killing everyone.
<Buytoast> this chat can barely handle tits from penn and teller
<Shizuka> 13where we learn the human body holds a hundred gallons of high pressure blood
<Sumica> 00,10should have some higgarushi or how ever you spell it too
<otakon> Shizuka: with invisible wire blades
<Bigcheese> otakon: vectors
<oni_link> Well either way, I feel like I should watch this with you or on my own . It just keeps showing up
<otakon> CAN'T WE JUST WATCH PANTY, STOCKING AND GARTERBELT?
<SpeccyRush> Shizuka: that's a standard anime trope
<otakon> oni_link: don't go alone
<Soulless_DCLXVI> She uses huge invisble arms
<Shizuka> 13elfen lied is a good series that brings up important points
<AJIsAwesome> Eh, I don't really like that show.
<otakon> Soulless_DCLXVI: with blades
<Shizuka> 13just does so in a very violent manner
<oni_link> otakon: lol why not?
<otakon> Shizuka: with blades :3
<Bigcheese> I highly reccomend watching elfen lied.
<Shizuka> 13speaking of anime i should block out three hours and finish our series soon
<Soulless_DCLXVI> It's a good anime. If a bit sad.
<otakon> I can't do sad
<otakon> Grave of the Fireflies ruined me
<Shizuka> 13haibane will have you bawling by the end
<otakon> RUINED ME
<Sumica> 00,10Law of Hemoglobin Capacity
<Sumica> 00,10The human body contains over 12 gallons of blood, sometimes more, under high pressure.
<otakon> lol what?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Yeah, since becoming a brony I've been on a strict happy media diet.
<Sumica> 00,10law of anime
<otakon> did you TV Tropes?
<Buytoast> yer makin me squirm man
<otakon> could be worse
<otakon> could be body horror
*otakon shudders
<Shizuka> 13oh it touches on that too
<otakon> O_O
<Shizuka> 13speaking of we need to watch akira
<otakon> NOOOOOOOOOO
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Sumica did you get your info from the fact sphere?
<otakon> oh God that last scene
<Sumica> 00,10Law of Transient Romantic Unreliability
<Sumica> 00,10Minmei is a bimbo.
<otakon> SO BUCKED UP
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Oh, THAT scene.....
<Shizuka> 13KANEDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<AJIsAwesome> Geez, that scene was......interesting.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: yeah probably the most twisted body horror scene in anime
<otakon> Closest I've seen in squick is Strait Jacket near the end
<CTHULHU> i like anime when they cry.
<Kandarihu> Shame on me, the only time I saw Akira was on Sci-Fi network, and it's only the second half of the movie.
<Sumica> 00,10Law of Sonic Amplification, First Law of Anime Acoustics
<Sumica> 00,10In space, loud sounds, like explosions, are even louder because there is no air to get in the way.
<otakon> Kandarihu: good times, good times
<otakon> I miss Saturday Anime
<otakon> ;_;
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Anime physics hurt mah brain
<otakon> Project A-ko was my first "real" anime
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Toonami has anime.
<otakon> Goddamn what a fun movie
<Sumica> 00,10I streamed Strait Jacket here once
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: it's not the same, plus they keep rerunning stuff
<SpeccyRush> it was interesting
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: What's the synopsis?
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: True.
<otakon> Sumica: the eyes man, THE EYES!
<Sumica> 00,10heh
<Sumica> 00,10very akira at the end
<SpeccyRush> you should show it again sometime sumi
<Sumica> 00,10I am thinking if my body can handle it this friday. we Do appleseed
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: okay, magic is real but it causes pollution. If you practice magic without a special suit on, the pollution turns you into a hideously deformed monster that only wants to kill. If the suit is damaged while performing magic, same thing.
<Shizuka> 13someone's been playing thaumcraft
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: ._______.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> That magic sucks
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: yeah, we get to see it in full detail at the end, with the guy SCREAMING before he goes completely insane "KILL ME!"
<AJIsAwesome> .......
<Soulless_DCLXVI> What anime is this?
<otakon> apparently it can happen slowly too with just build up
<otakon> Soulless_DCLXVI: Strait Jacket
<Shizuka> 13did i mention elfen lied also features animal abuse as a device to build the protagonist?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Ah
<oni_link> CTHULHU: oh me too! that show is twisted
<otakon> Steampunk meets Wizards meets Godzilla kind of
<Shizuka> 13elfen lied is by no means a light series
<Soulless_DCLXVI> I don't remember that.
<otakon> Shizuka: I don't like it, reminds me of another show for some reason
<Shizuka> 13anyway since we were on the subject of akira
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah there is some hard core gore in it AJIsAwesome
<RaveBrony> Akira??? :o
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: Hmm, well if that's the case it's probably something I'd not watch. :D
<Shizuka> 13marimba rules
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: yeah one demon dessicates it's victims, another is some mass of lard that shoots lasers from it's body
<Sumica> 00,10seeing as the show opens with a Dr going on a rampage in a hosptal
<otakon> I'm wondering when "The Thing" will get an anime treatment
<otakon> yeah he's using Sorcery for surgery
<otakon> his Cast busts
<otakon> he mutates in his suit and then rampages
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: This is an movie, yes?
<Sumica> 00,10OAV but yeah
<AJIsAwesome> *a
<otakon> yeah the thing is in that world, sorcery is only dangerous to those PRACTICING IT
<Sumica> 00,10well and every one in the area when they go out of control
<otakon> if you're a normal person, the Malediciton(magical pollution) has no affect on you
<Shizuka> 13rasse ra rasse ra rasse rasse rasse ra
<otakon> Sumica: well yeah but that goes without saying
<otakon> Shizuka: ??
<otakon> oh and apparently it can be passed on
<Polydunami> Whoa, this is a neat song
<Shizuka> 13main theme for akura

<XAX> otakon: 63% jellification and rising
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Not that I mind. I prefer it that way.

<NENUDJUS> My Hope Is Having Sex On The Moon
<oni_link> hahaha random XD
<NENUDJUS> Some Day
<MadSurge> Phase4: magnets, HOW DO THEY WORK
<NENUDJUS> MadSurge: The magnetic flux density (also called magnetic B field or just magnetic field, usually denoted B) is a vector field. The magnetic B field vector at a given point in space is specified by two properties:Its direction, which is along the orientation of a compass needle.Its magnitude (also called strength), which is proportional to how strongly the compass needle orients along that direction.In SI units, the strength of the magnet
<MadSurge> Dat answer :D
<oni_link> haha
<PonyNegZero> not sure if scholar or google search....
<KrazyNoobs> im back back back
<MadSurge> :O STREAM
<NENUDJUS> A good bar magnet may have a magnetic moment of magnitude 0.1 A•m2 and a volume of 1 cm3, or 1×10−6 m3, and therefore an average magnetization magnitude is 100,000 A/m.
<oni_link> Alright!!! Stream time!
<KrazyNoobs> STREEEAAAAAAAAM
<OneTrickPony> yay

<NENUDJUS> KrazyNoobs: Polka Face
<oni_link> SillyFilly64 is silly :3
<KrazyNoobs> Starchaser, I am guessing that, like many other shows, they procrastinated, and that they only had time to make 13 episodes for now, but they are probably scrambling up more episodes (not 13 more, maybe 5 or 6 more) to show halfway through the gap between seasons. Many other shows have done that, I am not all too sure about MLP:FiM though. I hope that's the case
<oni_link> me too KrazyNoobs

<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Nah, I don't think they'd want me. I'm not good enough at anything. :P
<AdamTheDuck> it was nice :3
<AdamTheDuck> well full glass anyway
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Ponies47. :)
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: What kind of wine, and with what food? =D
<AdamTheDuck> I have no idea :$
<Gold_Demona> lol
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but Gold_Demona we will have muffins!
<AdamTheDuck> Well it was champagne, but apparently not champagne
<Jmo> Lightweight.
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Do you at least know if it was a white wine or a red wine? :D
<AdamTheDuck> White
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Gold_Demona> White wines are nice :>
<AdamTheDuck> was like champagne*
<AdamTheDuck> I think I prefer red though
<Dark92Enigma> back from breakfast!
<Gold_Demona> Champagne is its own animal
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back Dark92Enigma
<Gold_Demona> It's like wine, but not
<Dark92Enigma> how's your morning been, everypony?

<AdamTheDuck> aniderp|bestcakeever, go ahead I guess :P
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i had whiskey before
<aniderp|bestcakeever> icccck
<Gold_Demona> What kind?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> idk
<AdamTheDuck> I've always wanted to try whiskey
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i felt like sipping before shooting it down
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dumb idea
<aniderp|bestcakeever> never sipping shots again
<Gold_Demona> Never sip liquor
<Gold_Demona> never
<Ponies47> Dat feel when you didn't fall asleep till about 1:00 AM and get up at 6:30 AM ;~;
<aniderp|bestcakeever> not to try it?
*AdamTheDuck licks Jmo :P
<Gold_Demona> No
<Gold_Demona> Never
<aniderp|bestcakeever> that was my mistake
<Gold_Demona> liquor is to taste with the back of your mouth, not the front
<TwilightSonata> Hiiiiiiiiiiii guyssss :3
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: THat feeling when you have insomnia and didn't sleep at all. ;~;
<Gold_Demona> Sipping makes you taste with the front
<TwilightSonata> xx
<aniderp|bestcakeever> well then i shot it down but didnt finish it
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i had water...
<aniderp|bestcakeever> after.. and i was shaking
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsAwesome, hehe, I thought you went to sleep a while ago :$
<AJIsAwesome> AdamTheDuck: I tried to, couldn't.
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp|bestcakeever, shaking? .-.
<Gold_Demona> shaking? O_o
<AdamTheDuck> Damn, now I'm not so sure about trying whiskey :<
<Gold_Demona> Whiskey is good if you have the right kind
<aniderp|bestcakeever> yea after my first shot i ever had i was shaking a bit
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i was joking when i said me and well i got one o.O
<Gold_Demona> lol
<aniderp|bestcakeever> aweful
<KrazyNoobs> I'll start playing pony music on here
<aniderp|bestcakeever> btw im underage D:
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp|bestcakeever, so am I :P
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i was 19.. before i turned 20
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, if you're drinking liquor straight, you're supposed to just rush it down your throat and enjoy the burn and the aftertaste. :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> now.. gotta wait till sep 17th 2013
<aniderp|bestcakeever> got it burned a bit..
<aniderp|bestcakeever> strong o.O
<Gold_Demona> The only way you're allowed to sip liquor is if it's mixed in something, like soda or in a cocktail drink.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i will promise you all something
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i wont drink until im legal age
<Gold_Demona> Good for you
<Gold_Demona> My husband did the same thing
*Ponies47 pats aniderp|bestcakeever on the head "good boy"
<aniderp|bestcakeever> girl*
<Gold_Demona> I was a bad girl and was drinking since my teens. :P
<AdamTheDuck> Hehe, I think I'll break the law again maybe once or twice again for the hell of it :$
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i will be a good girl and wont drink any more alchohol things until im legal age
<Gold_Demona> And my mother provided my drinks. :D
<Ponies47> aniderp|bestcakeever, derp. Sorry :$
<AdamTheDuck> Go back to bread Ponies47 :P
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<AdamTheDuck> and damnit frame that tumblr image I sent you
<Ponies47> I have to go to school shortly =_=
<Gold_Demona> Well, my lighter drinks. Any time I had liquor, I was out with my friends or my husband back when we were still dating. :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> guess what im gonna do when i turn 21 :D
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp|bestcakeever, drink? :$
<aniderp|bestcakeever> yes!
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: drink until you puke? :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but that means i cant take my meds that night..
<Vivix> What I did when I turned 21: Had some cake
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, alcohol + meds = really really bad
<AdamTheDuck> # Cider cider cider cider #
<aniderp|bestcakeever> on mood meds :\
<Gold_Demona> Hard cider! Yeah!
<Gold_Demona> I still have some cider, come to think of it...
<Gold_Demona> Too bad I ran out of liquor. :<
<aniderp|bestcakeever> you think i should wait till my parents home that night or?
<Gold_Demona> I usually have some rum lying around...
<Ponies47> All this talk about booze when there is a 15 year old in the room XD
<AdamTheDuck> What's rum like?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> should i drink during the day
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, I'm only a year older than you :P
<aniderp|bestcakeever> or wait
<Vivix> I would say you shouldn't drink at all, but if you do, don't get drunk
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: It tastes like a sweeter form of whiskey
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck, You are? O.O
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i would end up in the hospital if i got drunk
<aniderp|bestcakeever> since meds
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, how old did you think I was? :$
<TwilightSonata> Why didn't anyone say hi to me ;AAA;
<Vivix> Yeah
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but whenever i drink.. i will skip my meds
<Gold_Demona> TwilightSonata: because chat is busy. :P
<Vivix> I don't see the point in getting drunk, but there's alot out there that can taste really nice
<AdamTheDuck> Hello TwilightSonata o.o
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck, Idk. Never thought of dat really :p
<aniderp|bestcakeever> good enough?
<Dark92Enigma> AdamTheDuck: insert Fluttershy reference here
<Vivix> consult your physician
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Getting drunk can be fun if you don't overdo it
<Phase4> 00,02XD

<Vivix> Hehe
<aniderp|bestcakeever> Gold_Demona: i will be careful when i drink
<Vivix> I don't like getting drunk, but- each their own
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Please do.
<Vivix> I like the taste of vodka, but never had enough to get drunk
<aniderp|bestcakeever> since i on meds
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp|bestcakeever, wise decision.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> meaning i would skip my meds that night
<TwilightSonata> Vivix: Getting drunk at parties is awesome :D
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Yeah, I'd say be careful anyway, but you be extra careful.
<Vivix> I hate parties-
<Vivix> well, unless they're concerts or small
<TwilightSonata> Plus it gives you an excuse to get off with really hot guys without feeling like a slut >>>
<Vivix> Ha
<Gold_Demona> lol
<TwilightSonata> Parties are awesome! D:
<Gold_Demona> I'm too much of a nerd to know what it's like to attend a big party. =P
<Ponies47> I don't go to parties or anything really so you guys don't have to worry about me doing underage drinking.
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Jaymo
<Vivix> I don't feel comfortable with being drunk, It freaks me out
<Gold_Demona> Ohai Mojay! =D
<Vivix> I don't even drink at concerts, because I want to enjoy the music fully
<Jmo> I disconnected, what did you say Adam?
<AdamTheDuck> Just "Dat Jaymo"
<Jmo> No. In response to my question,.
<Phase4> 00,02steam is not designed to download as much as i'm asking it to
<aniderp|bestcakeever> dat jaymoo
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, you had a question?
<Jmo> Why are you under-age drinking?
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4 I was disconnected for some odd reason... :(
<TwilightSonata> don't any of you guys go to parties ever?
<Phase4> 00,02KrazyNoobs, 'reliable snapshot overflow'?
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4 Exactly
<Gold_Demona> wut

<Phase4> 00,02genshi is very hard on the server
<Phase4> 00,02tends to break
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, because I'm bored :3
<Gold_Demona> TwilightSonata: I grew up a nerd and a social reject. Parties are a foreign entity to me. =/
<Jmo> No, that is a shit excuse.
<KrazyNoobs> Okay... any other good ideas for servers?
<Jmo> Don't you try feeding that to me.
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4 Are you going to continue to play?
*AdamTheDuck feeds Jmo a shit excuse :3
<Vivix> I don't really like parties, but I do enjoy concerts, but they aren't really parties
*Ponies47 sits on Jmo 's head :3
<Phase4> 00,02KrazyNoobs, yeah

<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, don't think I'll be drinking anymore anytime soon anyway :P
<KrazyNoobs> What server shall we do, Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm breaking steam right now
<Jmo> Yeah no, I'm disappointed.
<Phase4> 00,02KrazyNoobs, try that one again
<KrazyNoobs> Have you ever tried vsh_dr?
<AdamTheDuck> You're always disappointed Jmo :P
<Gold_Demona> Mojay is not impressed?

<Gold_Demona> Like Puppet Dema?
*aniderp|bestcakeever pokes jaymoo
<Phase4> 00,02still wondering what to do with my 600GB of free space
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4 It is the best of all levels. There is hale, and he sets of traps while the red team runs down an obstacle course.
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Fill it with ponies! =D

<Dark92Enigma> Ha, ponies <_<
<Gold_Demona> I mean porn >_>

<KrazyNoobs> Now to play the pedobear song
<Saturn> 08,01now, the question is: do i use it to pay off my student loan, or do i use it as the start of my "cello upgrade" fund?
<Barbetos> pay da billz
<Jmo> I would say student loan.
<Saturn> 08,01i'd need abotu £1000 more for the cello i want, and that's after trade in
<MaxTheBrony> yepp
<AdamTheDuck> Jmo, ^
<MaxTheBrony> do loan
<AJIsAwesome> I'd say Student Loans, to be honest.
<MaxTheBrony> best for the future
<AJIsAwesome> Pay those off first.
<Barbetos> We are all boring
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Barbetos> Pay da loan
<Saturn> 08,01hm
<AdamTheDuck> Barbetos, ikr :D

<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, now be sensible :P
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: curently, my loan stands at about £40,000
<Phase4> 00,02interets?
<Barbetos> traxie
<Saturn> 08,01so i don't think £2000 is going to make all that much difference
<Phase4> 00,02intrest
<Wrek> 05Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02spelingf il
<Jmo> Alright, you made it sound like you were gonna be able to pay the whole thing off.

<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/oYi7x.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: i have a feeling that that's the correct answer
<Barbetos> But Saturn you have to understand I would SAY that I would use it to pay bills and then pay for a new computer instead or something
<MaxTheBrony> Im sorry but i have to not like it KrazyNoobs :C
<KrazyNoobs> Awwwww...
<Barbetos> Sooooo, "pay the bills" ;3
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Barbetos> Wow. Sound sexual.
<SafariMonkey> Hey, can someone mirror the recent Vinyl Scratch piece by Wrek on an image sharing website for me? I was really wanting to show someone, but can't access dA from here. If so, I can send a link to where you can mirror it temporarily.
<Vivix> That's what I think I'd do, unless the loan was really pressing or worrysome, but as long as it's not
<SafariMonkey> If that's OK with you, Wrek.
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, you need the skills to repay the bills
<Saturn> 08,01i love my cello, but i'd also love to have a 200 year old one
<AdamTheDuck> KrazyNoobs stahp, please.
<Vivix> Any specific in mind?
<Saturn> 08,01not really; it depends on what the various instrument shops have in
<KrazyNoobs> I'm playing Smile now
<Saturn> 08,01but i'd be looking at around the £6000 range
<Barbetos> run phase run
<Barbetos> Teleportaled!
<Saturn> 08,01£3000 from my current one traded in, £3000 cash
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ;_;
<Vivix> Hm, sounds like a good price range, not used to cello prices
<MaxTheBrony> o.o so much money
<AdamTheDuck> aniderp|bestcakeever, .-.
<Saturn> 08,01yeah, they're expensive fuckers
*AdamTheDuck places a muffin on aniderp|bestcakeever

<SafariMonkey> Saturn: I know about the cello and bow, but why so high for the case?
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: :D
<Barbetos> raritied
<Saturn> 08,01SafariMonkey: actually, i don't know. when i bought it, i paid £300 for it, but to replace it now, the same case is £750
<SafariMonkey> And can anyone? (see message at hh:49)
<Vivix> well, you want something sturdy and high quality to protect something at such a value
<Saturn> 08,01mind you, we're talking about 11 years since i bought the thing
*Jmo slaps SafariMonkey around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> Do you mean on Imgur SafariMonkey?
<SafariMonkey> Hey Jmo

<Saturn> 08,01wo 12 years ago, in fact
<Barbetos> I feel old
*Saturn 08,01has the best parents in the world
<Gold_Demona> If I'm doing my math right, I'm older tahn you Saturn. :D
<SafariMonkey> Jmo: http://picpaste.com/ would work great for me
<Gold_Demona> then*

<Saturn> 08,01so they went and spent £2000 on a cello for me
<SafariMonkey> Jmo: storetime low; 30min should be fine
<Gold_Demona> I'm married and not his type, Barbetos :P
<Saturn> 08,01Gold_Demona: sure you're my type
<Barbetos> Saturn I am inclined to agree with your previous statement of awesome parental units.
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, does that stop him? "$
<Saturn> 08,01you like gargoyles
<AdamTheDuck> :$ *
<Gold_Demona> :D

<Jmo> You're welcome Monkay.
<Gold_Demona> Ah! Scary pinkie o_o
<ponynest> Morning all :>
<Havok> I hate that pinkie special attack D:
<Saturn> 08,01i was only there for a year, but what a difference it made on my whole outlook on music
<Barbetos> Pinkamina killing people with a fish!
<Barbetos> I did not finish college but it change my outlook on everything.
<Barbetos> Needless to say I am not a crack addict now.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Barbetos> Yay college!
<Vivix> I went to a one year performing music school, changed a lot, and made me realize I need a shrink to help with social issues
<Gold_Demona> I went to a private university, so my "college experience" was REALLY different from what most people have. :P
<Barbetos> Now all you need is pony
<Barbetos> Why did you go to college to look at privates?
<Barbetos> =o
<Gold_Demona> dat sad Sweetiebell :C
<Vivix> Isn't that why anyone goes to college?
<Gold_Demona> lol Barbetos, not those kind of privates. :D

*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Barbetos> Oh. Huh.
*Saturn 08,01is basically at scotland's version of Oxford
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, we ranked higher than Oxford last year for Computer Science
<Barbetos> You make me not want to be in murica any more
<Barbetos> well.. Actually I already felt that way but still
<Barbetos> I blame texas
<Gold_Demona> I've had this graphic design degree for 6 years, and I haven't really done squat with it cuz I suck at graphic design. :P
<Phase4> 00,02"...focused primarily on building circuits via an Object Oriented approach that bundles collections of gates into Java objects"
<Phase4> 00,02the one thing electronics does not need is another hdl based of a crap programing language
<Phase4> 00,02we've already got a dialect of pascal
<Phase4> 00,02(techinically vhdl is based of ada, which is based of pascal, but still)
<SafariMonkey> Saturn: I'm looking at Bath for Maths, which is better and harder to get into for maths than Oxford or Cambridge.
<Barbetos> I make circuit boards so you can watch tv and use computers.
<Barbetos> Also tablets
<Vivix> I want to study animal behaviour- but I'm not 100% sure
<Barbetos> I think that is the rough translation
<Barbetos> Not what I do personally.
<Barbetos> I am just in IT. XD
<Gold_Demona> I maek artz! 8D
<Vivix> I wub artz!
<Barbetos> I've found that after leaving college, what you are good at, and what oyu want to do are two different things.
<Gold_Demona> Barbetos: True dat
<Phase4> 00,02and aparently verification and design are split into seperate languages
<Phase4> 00,02one day i'll design a better hdl
<Phase4> 00,02these are all crap
<Barbetos> Well I guess I should take a shower.
<Barbetos> and get ready for work
<Barbetos> But then bronystate happened.
<Barbetos> and coffee.
<Phase4> 00,02huh

<Barbetos> I once googled crotch boob for images
<Barbetos> and got a pic of Rarity and Gilda
<KrazyNoobs> Bye everypony! I have to go to bed now, my parents are getting rather pissed.
<Barbetos> Ponies really are everywhere now
<Barbetos> Go to bed KrazyNoobs
<Vivix> crotchboob is a bit pony isn't it though?
<Vivix> I mean, using that word
<Vivix> if you google beautiful mare, you also find a lot of pony

<Barbetos> I liked it fine too, untill I had a bunch of customers come back becuase the 2012 version was detecting that subs had expired.
<Barbetos> When they really had not
<Barbetos> And then the supposed hot fix did not work, if say, the customer reinstalled it to try and fix it
<Barbetos> Panda cloud was not all the good either when we changed to that,
<Barbetos> expensive and crappy
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, tell them you have a crashdump, if they dont ask for it then i'd just uninstall it
<Barbetos> The panda hate is strong with me wow. Ima shut up now
<Phase4> 00,02its likely a rare issue, they kinda need it

<Sylandest> C'est Impossible!
<Sylandest> I will restore it
<Sylandest> I did it yesterday, and by Celestia's beard, I shall do so again!
<Gold_Demona> lol Celestia's beard
<Sylandest> on a different note, Gold_Demona, how are you today? :)
<Barbetos> we will never know
<Gold_Demona> Sylandest: Doing pretty well. Rerranging my MP3 collection at the moment and making an mp3 cd of my christmas stuff so I can play it in my car. :D
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: ooh! I did that with my music, and repeat it every so odd occasion with new music
<Sylandest> Its always nice to have a christmas CD :)
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: I'm doing well, myself. I have an exam this morning in Sociology, and am currently stuffing my face for energy, lol
<Gold_Demona> Yesh, but it's hard to make a CD when you have over 12 hours of christmas music in your collection. :D
<Gold_Demona> Have to remove songs until I have less than 7 hours worth. XD
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: well, bugger me, thats a lot! :D What all sorts are you including?
<Vivix> Christmas music? That reminds me- I have to dig up Seventh Hour by steel pole bathtub
<Vivix> for some reason that song makes me all christmassy
<Sylandest> oh hai Vivix
<Vivix> haya southern horse
<Gold_Demona> Sylandest: Lots of stuff. Pop, Classical, Disney, Bing Crosby, Transiberian Orchestra, generic greeting card music. XD
<Gold_Demona> Among others
<Sylandest> Vivix: howdy indeed! :) How are you today?
<MadSurge> Sylandest: kick that exam's ass!
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: Goodness, you have a wide list!
<Vivix> I'm good :3 yourself?
<Sylandest> MadSurge: I shall! Sexuality and society this time
*GnomeWIthMushroom noms mushroom
<Vivix> Oh? Interesting subject
<Gold_Demona> Sylandest: I like to keep my music varied so I don't get bored. :>
<Sylandest> Vivix: I'm good as well, stuffing my face full of food, and studying notecards
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> What's your field?
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: As do I. Being eclectic is handy, no?
<Gold_Demona> Indeed
<Sylandest> Vivix: I'm actually an English major, focused in literature. Sociology is my minor.
<Sylandest> I study how people work and feel and think, and then I write about them :D
<Vivix> Nice
<Vivix> I want to study something similar, but more angled towards animals
<MadSurge> Sylandest: Oooh literature! Which author do you like the most?
<Vivix> Human studies are interesting though
<Sylandest> MadSurge: Far too many to count! XD Should I perhaps try a specific genre?
<Jmo> Vivix. You aren't studying it.
<Sylandest> Vivix: Oh, indeed. But you ponies are by far the most intriguing specimens I've uncovered yet
<Jmo> You can't be trusted around animals.
<MadSurge> Sylandest: nah, I have maaaaany favorites too
*Vivix beats Jmo ;__;
<Vivix> Hehe, I bet we are
<Vivix> Especially with being a new and still forming community
<GnomeStoned> >_>
<Sylandest> MadSurge: One of my favorites in the Sci-fi/fantasy genre is Jim Butcher, author of the Dresden Files. Tell me somepony's heard of him.
<Jmo> I've heard of him.
<Sylandest> yes!
<Jmo> I only said that to make you feel better.
<MadSurge> Sylandest: I heard of him, never read the Dresden Files though
<Sylandest> MadSurge: They're wicked good. Give them a read some time. The first book is "Storm Front".
<Gold_Demona> Sylandest: I have. My one friend raves about Dresden Files all the time
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: He is right to! They're bloody brilliant!
<Gold_Demona> she
<Sylandest> She!
<Sylandest> :$
<Sylandest> But, a very enjoyable series. They even tried to convert it to tv, like they did with Game of Thrones. Alas, it fell through. Too early, and too far away an approach
<MadSurge> Italy had many many many brilliant writers, not just Dante :D
<Sylandest> MadSurge: eeeyup, they did. We read Dante for class, funny enough
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Sylandest> oh hai Wrek
<Sylandest> I revived the chat for you
<Sylandest> you're welcome \:3/
<ouo> hey look, human is something doing with purple pony cutiemark - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eje8gp9shsM&t=0m43s
<Jmo> You didn't do shit Syl :P
<Vivix> I've never read Dante- probably should
<Sylandest> Jmo: I made the effort! :P
<MadSurge> Sylandest: Inferno is fun to read, unfortunately Purgatorio and especially Paradiso are more for poetry lovers
<Vivix> I love to read, but I'm a bit cought up in like-- fanfiction and indie fiction. Much less purple and "crime novels"
<Jmo> You only make effort in certain places.
<Jmo> Hohoho.
<MadSurge> Vivix: see my answer to Sylandest :D
<Sylandest> Vivix: What MadSurge said just before you.
<ouo> hahaha... i can't read :D
<Sylandest> Vivix: I used to write fanfiction, myself. Then /)college(\
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> Yeah, Dante's inferno is the one I would probably pick up
<ouo> well, actually i can
<Jmo> Dante's Inferno <3
<Sylandest> ouo: I would hope so, its a vital skill
<Vivix> but- I've gotten a distaste for purple, and sadly a lot of Norwegian fiction is full of it- and what isn't full of it tend to be 90% crime novels
<MadSurge> Vivix: purple?
<Vivix> Overly descriptive and poetic
<ouo> Sylandest, yeup just little asdf ref i did here :P
<Sylandest> Vivix: Have you tried breaching into the adventure/drama genre? I've read several good stories there
<MadSurge> Vivix: aaah, purple prose
<Sylandest> ouo: I caught it~ :)
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> noo, but that's kind of what I want- fantasy adventure-
<Sylandest> Vivix: Might I recommend the Dragonlance series?
<Vivix> I mean, in my twisted top 10 list, FoE is over Lotr, so that says some about my taste I suppose
*Vivix googles
<MadSurge> Vivix: fyi, mystery novels are called "yellows" in Italy
<Fluffy|Sleeping> Stream!
<MadSurge> Dat Gmod :D
<wipergone2> hi
<Sylandest> ooh, and stream lives even
<Vivix> yellows? Hmm, I like colour words
<Sylandest> hot damn, im good
<wipergone2> DAT SKYPE
<ouo> stream
<Vivix> Ooh, it's eh hm DnD ish?
<Jmo> How is LOTR twisted?
<Jmo> HOW.
<MadSurge> Puta merda :D
<Vivix> twisted list, not twisted books
<Sylandest> Vivix: not really, but it has that feel. I assure you though, its very good :)
<Jmo> YOU ARE TWISTED.
<Vivix> It sounds interesting- reading the wiki article on it now
<Sylandest> Gold_Demona: I told you I'd do it! Look at the chat now! I even brought stream to life
<wipergone2> Phase4: hi
<Sylandest> Vivix: nooooo, spoilers, noooooooooo
<Gold_Demona> Sylandest: LOL, so you did. :D
<Vivix> noo nono
<Vivix> only reading the eh- header
<wipergone2> bsod
<wipergone2> sfm
<Vivix> Fantasy with a lot of world building- sounds like my kinda thing
<Sylandest> Vivix: you're welcome~ :)
<Vivix> danke :3
*Jmo slaps Sylandest around a bit with a large trout
<Vivix> but yeah- FoE topped Lotr for me- Lotr was one of my favourite books from childhood
<MadSurge> COW FACE :D
<Vivix> but- FoE had gay romance and ultimate sacrifice- it made me cry where lotr didn't
<Sylandest> Vivix: If I would recommend another, I'd say to try the Colour of Magic
<wipergone2> MadSurge: hi
<MadSurge> Hi wipergone2!
<Sylandest> what is this :D
<Vivix> First book of Discworld?
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> Sif.

<Jmo> You bite me again and I'll take you away.
<Vivix> I also skipped the elven court in lotr book <,<
<Vivix> so long
<Jmo> SHAME ON YOU.
<Vivix> ;__; I'll stop biting

<VenHur> Hello everypony!
<Jmo> Excuses.

<Vivix> I should reread it
<Sylandest> Vivix: lol, "Legalese"
<Vivix> but-- I'd rather reread foe <,<
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Jmo> You will re-read LOTR and you'll like it.
<Vivix> I don't remember much of it, but I remember it being confusing
<Jmo> Now.

<BladedWings|Dishes> well i got some dishes to do, so brb
<SpadeKyurem> ....I'm so lonley
<Kurra> I'm so cold
*Kurra eats a grapefruit though :9
<Buytoast> how can you not like the cold
<Buytoast> you're abnormal
<alexxm> hey guys
<Kurra> The cold sucks man!
<JRP2234> yhello
<JRP2234> o shit
<JRP2234> its 4:45
<Kurra> Buytoast, you're abnormal if you don't want it to be the Caribbean errday |3
<Buytoast> bah, that shit's too hot
<Buytoast> plus you'd have monkeys pissing you off every day
<Vivix> Carribean is waay too hot
<Vivix> but--something in between would be nice
<Buytoast> at least with the cold you can warm up with a blanket at night
<Kurra> That's what the Caribbean sea is for, duh: :O :)
<Buytoast> if it's too hot you're outta luck
<Vivix> That's true
<Kurra> Nah, you just get in the ocean!
<Vivix> and blankets are cosier than the beach
<Kurra> And spray yourelf with Canadian squirt guns and things
<Kurra> Your elves, yourself, everyone!
<Buytoast> ocean has seaweed
*Vivix squirts Kurra with squirtgun at winter
<alexxm> so whats up guys
<Vivix> beach is also always full of kids and weird old men
<Kurra> We're having cold heat debate.
<Buytoast> cold is better
<Kurra> Pff, y'all have no idea at all.
<Buytoast> wish it'd start snowing here
<Dark92Enigma> heat is better. (sorta)
<Buytoast> aint seen a flake
<Vivix> Finally snowed here last week
<Vivix> was worried we'd have a gray christmas
<Kurra> Go in the snow yeh? You get snow everywhere, and then it freezes, and then you have to melt it, and thne you still have to dry it and that takes all day
<Buytoast> send that shit my way
<Buytoast> otherwise we're probably gonna end up waiting until february for snow
<Buytoast> plus shoveling snow is great
<Vivix> Snow is great because you can sit inside and look at it, all warm and fuzzy by the fire
<Kurra> Get wet in the heat, and oh it's refreshing and not only that you can wetmane all day at everyone if you want, it's just better. </jeremycoltson>
<alexxm> so no stream then
<Kurra> ...well okay, the cold is good excuse to keep warm with snuggling.... c.c hmm.
<Vivix> and if its nows at night, and noone has been outside, it looks crazy idyllic
<alexxm> so whats up Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm i'm fine, but my middle brother just beat me up
<alexxm> how come Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm he wanted to throw a shovel next door, and i prevented him to do so, then he punched me in the back several times

<Bronysith> plugs
<SuperBrony64> 11,02You see...being a professional brony is a tough position to achieve. It requires a degre in it and a minimum of 10+ years experience before attaining a good job for it.
<Bronysith> bronies havent existed for that long

<SuperBrony64> 11,02NU-HUH
<Chrysalis> and let the other listeners ignore the warning
<Dark_Horst> i like how the top machinegun is controlled by a playstation controller
<Chrysalis> must be easier than iterating finding the SB listener
<Shizuka> 13that would be eventSystem.publish("OI YOU STARTIN MATE", WARNING);

<SpadeKyurem> The sky
<SuperBrony64> 11,02YOUR FACE
<SpadeKyurem> SuperBrony64: IT WAS PAIN!
<Meanwhile> Go back to sleep anyway.
<Fluffy> Make me. Without force.
*Fluffy waits
<SpadeKyurem> Anyway! Back to playing WoW till steamies
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bronies have a way of making others do stuff without nothing more than saying a few words.
<SpadeKyurem> People are wasting money trying to find out who Mona Lisa was, why do we waste money on this shit?
<Fluffy> He can't make me to back to sleep. Only I can.
<Everlasting_Joy> I must take off. See you guys later!
*Bronysith glomps Everlasting_Joy "oh no you dont"
<Meanwhile> Yeah, try it out, by saying "I'm a brony" in a public place you can make nearby people laugh.
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 namely Generic idea + ponies = :o
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WOAH THERE COWBOY
<BladedWings> bye Everlasting_Joy
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: kill yourself already
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Finding out who Mona Lisa was is a groundbreaking scientific moment.
<Meanwhile> Do you even know what the Mona Lisa is?
<Fluffy> I say "I'm a brony" in public. No fucks to be given.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02That one painting...of the...thing
<SpadeKyurem> Yea I do but they dont need to analyze everything
<Meanwhile> Serious question.
<BladedWings> yes Meanwhile?
<Meanwhile> I already asked and it wasn't aimed at you.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The painting of the young lady that Leonardo DiVinci painted...I think he did it...
<BladedWings> oh nvm :$
<SpadeKyurem> The woman posed for the painting, thats all anyone needs to fucking know
<Meanwhile> Leonardo da Vinci, but close enough.
<Buytoast> The guy from Titanic is a painter too?
<Bronysith> dats dicaprio
<BladedWings> :D
<Meanwhile> Well he painted the lady like a French girl in the movie, so...
<SpadeKyurem> Woah what the hell, a 7 and 11 year old held up a woman at gun point
<SpadeKyurem> In a church parking lot
<SpadeKyurem> The fuck people
<BladedWings> wat?
<Fluffy> Fucking kids these days.
<SpadeKyurem> Just came on the news just a second ago
<BladedWings> Fluffy: was just thinking that
<SpadeKyurem> HOW DID A SEVEN YEAR OLD KID GET A GOD DAMN GUN!
<Meanwhile> Where was this?
<SpadeKyurem> Portland Oregon
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: everything makes sense now
<Meanwhile> Well there you go then.
<MadSurge> Is Oregon that messed up?
<SpadeKyurem> I saw on the news yester day a mother and a father drove their daughter to a bus stop to beat up another kid and THEY CHEERED HER ON
<Fluffy> Oh. My. God
<SpadeKyurem> I hate humanity so much...
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: lets move to equestria?
<BladedWings> SpadeKyurem: what da hell
<MadSurge> Well here we can't get eaten by a hydra or petrified by a cockatrice :s
<BladedWings> ^
<Bronysith> thats why you stay in ponyville
<Bronysith> or canterlot
<Bronysith> instead of wandering into the everfree forest
<MadSurge> Bronysith: better to be molested than eaten, eh?
<Bronysith> MadSurge: duh
<Bronysith> at least molestia wont hurt you if you dont fight back
<SpadeKyurem> Equestria is a bad place to live
<SpadeKyurem> Every week some shit goes down
<Bronysith> i dont care
<SpadeKyurem> Either some monster,ancient artifact, some evil god
<Bronysith> its worth it if i get to be with molestia
<Bronysith> haha
<SpadeKyurem> Not to mention the citizens are jerks
<Bronysith> so is america
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: Cant argue with that I live there
<Bronysith> same SpadeKyurem
<SpadeKyurem> anyone here ever go to disney world?
<Bronysith> hell yea
<Bronysith> unviversal studios is better though
<SpadeKyurem> You know what I hate? When the ride says no flash pictures and some chucklefucks still do it
<Bronysith> chucklefucks?
<alexxm> SpadeKyurem i went to the one in paris
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: <.< at least disney takes care of their rides
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Discussion: Drawing Training Ground - Episode Editions
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: at least universal is much more fun
<Bronysith> universal has some awesome fucking rides
<SpadeKyurem> I liked the cruise ships
<SpadeKyurem> I got free icecream
<Bronysith> thats on every cruise ship
<Bronysith> free food is on every cruise ship
<Bronysith> cause you alreadey paid a shitload of money
<SpadeKyurem> and a game center?
<Bronysith> except holland america, they dont have a game center, fuck that
<SpadeKyurem> My disney cruise ship had shit like a movie theater, a stage theater, a club to play video games and hang out, an arcade, mini golf
<SpadeKyurem> Fuck yea
<Bronysith> i remember they had that on Royal caribean
<Bronysith> fun times
<Bronysith> i want to go on disney one though
<butler> luna
<Bronysith> is sexy princess
<butler> agreed
<Bronysith> same as celestia
<Bronysith> and rarity, and twilight
<butler> fluttershy
<Bronysith> braeburn, soarin, spitfire,
<SpadeKyurem> Luna is best princess
<Bronysith> she is a kind mistress indeed
<Bronysith> "cough cough"
<Buytoast> the only good horse is yellow quiet
<SpadeKyurem> You mean nerdy purple
<Bronysith> rarity is a teasing yet kind mistress
<Buytoast> white selfish is a terrible and low tier horse
<butler> big mac is good too
<SpadeKyurem> Buytoast: Indeed *sips tea*
<Bronysith> doesnt matter, she would be a kind and teasing mistress
<Bronysith> awesome
<Meanwhile> Yellow Quiet is the worst horse.
<Meanwhile> Pink Crackhead is obviously superior.
<butler> who was yellow quiet?
<Bronysith> pinkie pie is too hyperactive for my tastes >.>
<Buytoast> pink obnoxious is mid tier at best
<Buytoast> even the cider sliders are superior to her
<SpadeKyurem> So does Celestia just go on fucking vacation when ever a evil threat shows up and lets Twilight and her lackies deal with it?
<Bronysith> she would probably break my spine and the bed
<Meanwhile> Cider Slider is a background horse.
<Bronysith> from pure hyperactivity
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: just like any good leader
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: Again people ask why I hate celestia
<Buytoast> At least that's more of a horse than what pink obnoxious is.
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: understandable, id still want her to #*$% me
<SpadeKyurem> Bronysith: ?)
<alexxm> what about spectrum speeder
<SpadeKyurem> */)
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: youd let her #*$% you?
*SpadeKyurem shrugs
<SpadeKyurem> I'd majorly go for Luna though,
<Bronysith> what about luna?
<Bronysith> hell yea
<Bronysith> luna is sexy princess like that
<Bronysith> also considering shes been around for thousands of years, she probably picked up a few tricks
<twilight_squirtle> i come in to see this conversation. it must be a sign i should get back to studying
<SpadeKyurem> Hah
<BladedWings> twilight_squirtle: about the same DX
<butler> study hard then
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: of course she would have a few tricks up her...hoof slipper...things
<butler> who thinks apple bloom is the cutest filly?
<SpadeKyurem> Disregard School, Play WoW
<SpadeKyurem> Sweetie Belle
<SpadeKyurem> Your argument is invaid
<SpadeKyurem> *invalid
<butler> sorry
<jcelios> my hair is a pony
<BladedWings> what kind of pony?
<Scootaflew> Me when school lets out http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/043/3/d/scootaloo_is_happy__by_boem777-d4pimtd.png
<butler> who's the first to air something on this site?
<jcelios> a black and red alicorn OC with a dark past
<jcelios> who I shipped with Twilight Sparkle
<butler> cool,jcelios
<Bronysith> jcelios: kill yourself
<jcelios> and because he's also my hair I guess I'm shipping myself also 0_o
<butler> bronysith, don't be rude
<Meanwhile> At first I thought that red and black alicorn thing was a joke but now I'm not so sure.
<Bronysith> Red and black alicorn OC with a dark past shipped with a canon character? kill yourself you uncreative bastard
<jcelios> Meanwhile: would it help if I ship you with him also
<Meanwhile> Not really, it'd clear it up more if you just said whether you were joking or not.
<butler> how can you ship hair?
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/jxTa7.jpg
<jcelios> butler: the fandom found a way
<Meanwhile> Scissors and Fedex?
<jcelios> and yeah I was joking XD
<Bronysith> seriously, fuck this fandom most of the time ...
<butler> ok.....
<Meanwhile> Oh good. Otherwise I would have had to mock you until you left.
<butler> that is against regulations
<Meanwhile> Your face is against regulations.
<butler> wanna play rough?
<Meanwhile> That sounds a bit homo, so not really.
<Bronysith> dont mind Meanwhile the only way he finds joy in life is by causing others misery
<jcelios> I just assumed the fact that I said he was made out of my own hair was crazy enough to make it obvious but yeah this fandom sometimes....
<butler> thanks
<Bronysith> this is one of the worst fandoms ever
<Bronysith> you cannot fucking deny it XD
<jcelios> it can be XD
<butler> and it is
<butler> you just got to find more of us out there
<Punkie_Pue> test
<Punkie_Pue> woot it works
<SpadeKyurem> Eh Sonic is worse
<jcelios> yeah whats up with that?
<BladedWings> Punkie_Pue: what works?
<jcelios> why do so many crazy people gravitate towards sonix?
<jcelios> sonic
<Meanwhile> Nostalgia?
<Bronysith> cause sonic is also a horrible fandom
<Punkie_Pue> Testing Thrash irc. it was giving problems earlier.
<BladedWings> ah
<SpadeKyurem> I really hate my english class
<SpadeKyurem> Guess what I have to do
<Bronysith> cause sonic fans are never fucking satisfied
<jcelios> SpadeKyurem: French?

<butler> jcelios:cool collectibles?
<SpadeKyurem> Worth 300 points of my grade
<SpadeKyurem> For information, the Semester Test is only 220 total
<Bronysith> seriously, sonic fans are terrible usually
<SpadeKyurem> Am I terrible?
<Bronysith> like bronies, there are few exceptions
<butler> bronysith, agreed
<SpadeKyurem> Im a sonic fan
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: there are exceptions like you
<SpadeKyurem> You know who the worst sonic fans are?
<SpadeKyurem> Sonic Retro
<BladedWings> Ok guys i must be off to class, see yall later tonight :)
<butler> sonic is cool but not that cool
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: people liked that?
<SpadeKyurem> Bitching about Sky Sacntuary not being yellow enough da fuck
<jcelios> In all fairness most "sonic fans" probably don't even talk about sonic on the internet are regular people XD
<jcelios> and are*
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye BladedWings :)
<Bronysith> well
<jcelios> got to keep selection bias in mind at least if we're gonna speculate about whole populations
<Bronysith> sonic fans make the worst OCs

<SpadeKyurem> SA2
<Cynnivel> Sonic Adventure 2

<Bronysith> one thing i dont like about bronies
<Bronysith> they feel the need to ponify EVERYTHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING
<SpadeKyurem> I find it funny most of the famous people that shaped this country flunked out of school
<SpadeKyurem> Im pretty sure Einstine was one fo them
<Bronysith> to join the army
<Bronysith> except obama
<Bronysith> hes the only one to not have any military or political experience
<Bronysith> dafuq
<SpadeKyurem> And they say School is important
<SpadeKyurem> LIES
<SpadeKyurem> Well does making an atom bomb count?
<Cynnivel> Relevant: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_ZmM7zPLyI
<butler> the A-bomb does more damage than we know
<butler> it takes longer to clean
<butler> the aftermath that is
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: i think school is mostly important for people who want to go into medicine, law, education
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3quTc2-GyM best video ever
<Ryunosuke> well
<SpadeKyurem> Again, Einstien made a fucking atom bomb and never went to school
<Ryunosuke> i kinda agree
<Bronysith> for everything else
<Bronysith> you just wasting time
<Bronysith> and money
<SpadeKyurem> I dont think I need that much education to program or model videogames
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: but not everyone has that kind of intelligence like einstein
<butler> agreed
<Bronysith> but they brainwash you into believing that YOU NEED COLLEGE
<butler> most people are below average intelligence
<Bronysith> more like YOU NEED TO GIVE US MONEY
<Bronysith> butler: thank you jersey shore
<SpadeKyurem> I dont think college is needed
<Bronysith> butler: but wouldnt below average if thats the majority be just average then?
<SpadeKyurem> they just use it as an excuse to dry you up
<SpadeKyurem> My brother is still fucking paying off his college bill
<butler> idk,bronysith
<Bronysith> yes, yes you do
<SpadeKyurem> This is lies
<Bronysith> seriously fuck college
<Bronysith> only reason im in there is so i can get an education degree
<Cynnivel> Cool. Ignore my link.
<Bronysith> so it is neccessary
<butler> ok. yes they would be and some of them are the smartest
<butler> sorry for delay
<Bronysith> that is the only reason im at college, to get a degree in education to teach elementary kids
<butler> ok
<Bronysith> cause seriously, kids are idiots
<butler> i hope you're good with them

<pony_4942> wow. sure thing a lot of people here.

*SpadeKyurem facepalms
<bo0oring> well, then it Luna. Luna is cool. :3
*Bronysith licks SpadeKyurem
<SpadeKyurem> I'm getting tired of these people who think they can use unions to get away with shit
<butler> awwww
<SpadeKyurem> In this economy, you take what you get
<butler> yup
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: one of the reasons hostess went under
<Bronysith> cause people
<Bronysith> are
<Bronysith> MORONNNNNS
<Bronysith> FUCKING IDJIOTS
<butler> lol
<SpadeKyurem> Heres one example
<SpadeKyurem> A bunch of airlines closed
<Bronysith> IDJIOTS
<butler> lol
<Bronysith> IDJIOTS EVERYWHERE IT FUCKING BURNS
<butler> lol
<SpadeKyurem> The the piolits go on strike because tthere arent enough jobs
<SpadeKyurem> The fuck
<bo0oring> Mr. Smith, calm down.
<CriticKitten> Uh.
<CriticKitten> Misinformed much?
<Bronysith> shut up CriticKitten im sure Shizuka would agree
<CriticKitten> The reason Hostess went under isn't because lolunionsareevul
<SpadeKyurem> They kind aare
<CriticKitten> It's because Hostess wanted the workers to take ANOTHER pay cut.
<SpadeKyurem> My dad worked for a union
<SpadeKyurem> When shit goes down they dont protect you
<Lindeman> No one streaming? D:
<Bronysith> IDJIOTS
<CriticKitten> What you didn't hear from your favorite news station is that Hostess has been cutting their wages for years.
<SpadeKyurem> Plus people seem to think THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING being a union
<CriticKitten> Over and over and over again.
<CriticKitten> And they were finally fed up with making less money for doing more work.
<Bronysith> Well
<Shizuka> 13less money?
<Shizuka> 13they were making $16 an hour
<Bronysith> Now they have NO FUCKING MONEY
<Shizuka> 13for assembly line work
<Bronysith> NO MONEY AT ALL CriticKitten so stfu
<Shizuka> 13that's on TOP of benefits
<Bronysith> thousands are making no money at all
<Bronysith> cause of IDJIOTS
<Shizuka> 13yes hostess was backed into a corner by what their upper management had done with the finances
<CriticKitten> If you're going to be impolite I'm not going to bother having this conversation.
<Shizuka> 13but the union picked a retarded time to push for a strike
<SpadeKyurem> Why are all the higher up people morons?
<Shizuka> 13because the government is set up to let them
<butler> why
<Bronysith> Cause higher ups requires idiocy
<butler> are they busy
<CriticKitten> Shizu: I don't disagree in the slightest. My point was that this isn't the first time Hostess said "so we need you to go ahead and make less money plz"
<SpadeKyurem> Would it be considered blasphmey to act intelegent?
<Bronysith> only idjiots can be politicians
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: apparently
<bo0oring> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBlw4C6rzDo
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: the problem is in this economy it's pretty dumb for the union to say NO WE WANT MORE when they're already making quite a lot more than similar unskilled work
<CriticKitten> Their management was a pack of wild idiots. Sure, the strike came at a terrible time, but blaming the union for this and no one else?
<SpadeKyurem> Also I still think that strike wallmart people did
<CriticKitten> Is just outrageously silly.
<Shizuka> 13everyone involved was stupid
<bo0oring> hey, i was wandering already for a long time: whats needed for to stream?
<bo0oring> offtopic...
<Bronysith> and now everyone fucking suffers
<Shizuka> 13high management took a gamble on investments and blew it, and left lower management holding the bag
<SpadeKyurem> they are whining they have to work on black friday and the thanksgiving black friday
<CriticKitten> Shizu: I agree, everyone had a pretty firm hold on the idiot ball here. I just object to this nonsense that it was purely the union's fault. >_>
<SpadeKyurem> In this econemy people need jobs
<Shizuka> 13lower management absolutely had to make more money otherwise the company would fold
<SpadeKyurem> They threatened to walk if they didnt get off
<SpadeKyurem> They can be easily replaced
<Bronysith> and hostess threatened to close down
<CriticKitten> Which is what they should have done.
<Bronysith> FOREVER
*CriticKitten shrugs
<Bronysith> AND NOW THEY CLOSING
<Bronysith> FOREVER
<Shizuka> 13liquidating
<CriticKitten> But Hostess's management, again, was too stupid to just say "okay, you're all fired".
<Shizuka> 13true that
<Shizuka> 13that may have been in part from the pressure from the other unions
<CriticKitten> And just hire people willing to take the jobs.
<CriticKitten> Maybe. Doesn't excuse them from some blame IMO.
<SpadeKyurem> CriticKitten: Which isnt that hard these days
<Shizuka> 13no but it's enlightenment
<SpadeKyurem> Which is why if anyone threatens to walk, I'll say BUH BYE
<Shizuka> 13if management said "okay, all you bakers union, bye we'll find people that want to work", there's a pretty good chance their other unions would have gotten mad
<Shizuka> 13unions these days are high on power
<CriticKitten> Which is why I said what I said. It's not just the unions being idiots. It's just that everyone wants to blame the unions because it's easier to blame one party in an argument rather than admitting that maybe both sides fucked this up
<SpadeKyurem> Not really
<CriticKitten> Ergo why we have people who still think that if we just vote all of one party into office, that things will magically get better
<SpadeKyurem> CriticKitten: Ie Obama because free shit
<CriticKitten> 'cuz that's how compromise works.
<Shizuka> 13or that congress passing only a couple laws in a term is a BAD thing
<Shizuka> 13gridlock is what the system was designed for
<CriticKitten> One side getting all the power totally makes democracy work right?
<SpadeKyurem> Majority of the people who voted for him have GOVERNMENT BENIFITS
<SpadeKyurem> THAT WE PAY FOR
<SpadeKyurem> It isnt free you chucklefucks!
<Bronysith> "HURR DURR, WE WANT MORE MONEY WITH LITTLE TO NO WORK"-every obama supporter ever
<Shizuka> 13well not just that
*Cynnivel snorts
<Shizuka> 13there's also the OMFG THE REPUBLICANS ARE EVIL crowd
<CriticKitten> Actually, I voted for Obama in '08 because the alternative wasn't all that appealing to me.
<Shizuka> 13no mccain was a terrible candidate
<CriticKitten> I didn't vote for him this year, though.
<SpadeKyurem> I dont see the problem with Romney
<CriticKitten> Because I was fucking pissed that he extended the Patriot Act.
<Shizuka> 13palin got burned out by the media so early on they didn't have a chance
<CriticKitten> And his voucher of support for internet regulation didn't thrill me either
<Bronysith> at least Romney didnt want SOPA
<PonyNegZero> Wait, you guys didn't vote for Celesta/Luna? I'm disappointed...
<CriticKitten> Palin was part of the reason I didn't pick McCain actually, yeah.
<Bronysith> aka fucking taxing the internet
<SpadeKyurem> The hell is taxing the internet gonna solve?
<Deacon> hola compadres
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: more money for the government
<Deacon> taxing the internet?
<CriticKitten> I got tired of her really quickly. Part of it being media coverage and part of it being that some of what she said just made my head hurt.
<Shizuka> 13one of the major issues conservatives have, and quite a few of us know it, is too often we try to take the high road
<BerryPunch> Title on www.bronystate.net: Episode Livestream Post-Show with special guest Andrea Libman! | BronyState
<SpadeKyurem> You know what was the best thing about that debate?
<SpadeKyurem> Obama had no fucking idea what he was saying
<Shizuka> 13so when you have a media industry dedicated to tearing apart everything not-Democrat, we turn the other cheek because we think it's the right thing to do
<SpadeKyurem> He stammers and went uh alot
<CriticKitten> I'm not entirely convinced Romney did either. >_>
<CriticKitten> The town hall debate especially.
<MadSurge> Hahaha Shizuka, you want to talk about that with my dad? He's the personnel officer at his job and he loathes unions despite being a lefter :D
<CriticKitten> They both avoided questions like the plague
<Bronysith> what the hell, lottery results were posted, but not on the frontpage
<Shizuka> 13we figure people will join us because of character, and we're getting shown time and time again that the general public is much much more base than that
<Bronysith> huh...

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bronysith: They are on the homepage
<SpadeKyurem> Also them saying Romney is gonna give old people a voucher system is bullshit
<Major> Ello
<CriticKitten> "What sort of deductions are you considering for the tax code?" "Let me answer that by saying absolutely nothing about my plan that answers your question." said both candidates
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai Major :)
<SpadeKyurem> Obama's way is OH you're too old you dont need medical aid
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: there we go
<SpadeKyurem> HOW IS OBAMA BETTER
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: i get the sense the issue there was it's largely ryan's plan
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: whats that? you worked hard your entire life and are successful? PUNISHMENT GAME
<CriticKitten> Likely, because Romney really dodged on specifics there and that hurt him a lot.
<Nittany_Discord> Hi.
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Major> Political stuff, eeeeeeeewwwwwww
<bo0oring> hey
<Major> Nittany_Discord Hi
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hey Nittany_Discord :)
<Deacon> hola bo0oring
*Cynnivel snuggles Nittany_Discord
<Shizuka> 13between President Um and Candidate It's-My-VP's-Plan we still got shafted this election
<Bronysith> Major: you are going into the military, therefore you are going to be a dog of the governemnt
<Shizuka> 13flaria changed nicks!
<bo0oring> Deacon hello
<SpadeKyurem> Obama still hasent explained the ambassidor incident
<Cynnivel> I did.
*Bronysith glomps Nittany_Discord
<CriticKitten> Shafted might be too generous of a word.
<Shizuka> 13royally hosed
<thelonepony> okay, i'm back. fking tech guy from school :I
*Cynnivel hugs Shizuka, too
<SpadeKyurem> I want a god damned explination why those ambassidors were NOT FUCKING GUARDED
<Shizuka> 13flaria <3
<Dark_Horst> ambassador incident?
<Dark_Horst> not following the news lately, what happneed?
<Shizuka> 13on a completely different note why am i trying to build a large house in minecraft... i don't even know what i would do with a large house...
<SpadeKyurem> the diplomats I mean
<Shizuka> 13benghazi?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: burn it down
<Buytoast> build it so you can burn it
<SpadeKyurem> That one i think
<CriticKitten> I'd take it further, Shizu. We got Eva Rule 1'd.
<Deacon> Shizuka so you can house your big things of course
<SpadeKyurem> Obama still hasnt said a god damn thing about the lack of security
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: always gets worse?
<Dark_Horst> doesnt ring
<MadSurge> Shizuka: unfortunately all right wing politicians here still are "HURR DURR IMMEGRUNT TEKENG UR JERB" or in it just for their personal gain :|
<CriticKitten> Which probably means the next election....ugh.
<Shizuka> 13yeah minecraft is large scale but... bleh i'm wasted on interior design...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: Put a smaller house inside the larger house.
<Dark_Horst> so what DID happen?
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: ALWAYS.
<Major> Bronysith like Ill listen to the government :P
<CriticKitten> Think about it. You know it's the truth.
<Bronysith> Major: hahahahah, like you have a choice being in the military
<Bronysith> dumbass
<Shizuka> 13sec i'll upload a picture
<SpadeKyurem> Dark_Horst: Basically a bunch of people charged into the diplomat building
<SpadeKyurem> Killed the dipomats
<CriticKitten> All the elections anymore are just getting worse and worse.
<Dark_Horst> oh hey, i think i might have heard someone once mention that
<SpadeKyurem> Therte were barely any guards and they KNEW they were beefing up ANTI AMERICAN SECURITY
<Bronysith> Major: going into the military, you become a symbol of the government, you do whatever they say for that is what the job of being a grunt or officer is
<SpadeKyurem> THERE IS NO FUCKING EXCUSE FOR THE LACK OF GUARDS OBAMA
<thelonepony> SpadeKyurem: wait, what did i miss?
<Nittany_Discord> This election was a choice between a socialist and capitalist businessman. Seeing we're in a recession and many people hate business-types, it was the socialist FTW.
<Bronysith> Major: if not you will be jailed or executed or some bullshit like that
<Shizuka> 13http://i2.minus.com/izNgEu8bI8QDN.png
<Major> Bronysith like you being hated by everypony
<thelonepony> Bronysith: he'll be jailed
<Dark_Horst> dead diplomats. usually, that's be followed by tanks
<Major> asshole
<SpadeKyurem> I still say Romney would have been a better option
<Bronysith> Major: im just saying what awaits you in the military
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: But...that's not a house D:
<Bronysith> cause that is what being in the military is
<SpadeKyurem> At least Romney isnt going to make everyone buy healthcare
<Nittany_Discord> Romney would have been a better option if he had kept his mouth shut.
<SpadeKyurem> NOT EVERONE NEEDS IT
<MadSurge> Shizuka: aaa, how lovely! :) (even if unfinished)
<Major> Bronysith Ill take my chances
<Shizuka> 13yeah.. it's a critical fantastical failure of message handling on the right's part, you need to build capital in order to crawl out of a recession, not tax the producers into the ground
<CriticKitten> Anyways, we got really derailed there. XD Anyways, yes, I'm in a union. No, I'm not evil. Yes, I do think for myself and willingly chose it. Why? Because I work in a low-income neighborhood full of entitled little shits who would sue me to hell and back if they could, and administration that actually performs illegal activities, so the added protection is actually sort of nice.
<Bronysith> stupid choice
<Bronysith> going to die for nothing
<Shizuka> 13unions work when they actually need to defend their workers
<SpadeKyurem> >Need to getmoney to get out of a rescession
<CriticKitten> So, yeah. Bash me if you want, but work in my environment and tell me I'm making the wrong call. >.>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I think Derpy Hooves should be president.
<SpadeKyurem> > SPEND MORE MONEY
<SpadeKyurem> HOW DOES THAT FUCKING WORK OBAMA
<Shizuka> 13too often, and especially the big ones, they just swing around like a club demanding free stuff
<SpadeKyurem> HOW
<Dark92Enigma> SuperBrony64: nope.....it's a mad house.
<Nittany_Discord> Need to give people incomes.
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Like in New York.
<Shizuka> 13SuperBrony64: is just the framework for now
<thelonepony> SuperBrony64: http://i.imgur.com/aPCg7.jpg

<SpadeKyurem> Also Obama is never fucking in the white house

<Bronysith> http://25.media.tumblr.com/09fdee33f26978a1c77c1d30d909f9d1/tumblr_meumdt9VpO1qzaea7o8_1280.png gotta love translating audio on youtube
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hai The_Engineer :)
<Nittany_Discord> I'm still searching for something I can handle. Way too fucking hard to find work nowadays. I'm having the state do it.
<MadSurge> thelonepony: :Q
<Shizuka> 13just have to figure out how to design the exterior walls and what the interior layout will be
<Nittany_Discord> That's what we really need to fix.
<Bronysith> Major: better than dieing for a stupid cause
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Build like a roof right now on top of what you have. It will look like there isn't really a house and then build underground :D
<SpadeKyurem> You know whats really stupid?
<Shizuka> 13but i want a big living room with a fireplace and huge windows to the ocean behind the camera
<SpadeKyurem> Obama says he needs money for obamacare
<Nittany_Discord> But it's probably crazy me making something small huge.
<SpadeKyurem> WELL STOP SPENDING TI ALL YOU DUMB SHIT
<SpadeKyurem> A DOG COULD BE A BETTER PRESIDENT THAN YOU!
<Dark92Enigma> So Major wants to die on the army.......
<Dark92Enigma> SpadeKyurem: Winona?
*SpadeKyurem flips a table in fury
<CriticKitten> And, for what it's worth, my mother is a Republican and also unionized for the same reason. So I'm not just crazy, it's actually kind of important in this profession any more. :p
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: But...but...where will my video games go? O~O
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: he spends it on ads
<Shizuka> 13Nittany_Discord: and you would think part-times would be easier to find since it sits under the insurance requirements but noooope
*The_Engineer crys in rage
<The_Engineer> NO DISRESPECT
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: he spends all the money on ads to ask for money
*SuperBrony64 glomps The_Engineer
*The_Engineer kicks SuperBrony64
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: like i said when they're necessary to keep working conditions good, they're good :)
<SpadeKyurem> Need money > spend money WHAT
<Dark92Enigma> SuperBrony64: 1000000 years dungeon?
<Major> Bronysith oh yeah like living in a shithole with a job that hardly pays you at all
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Owww O~O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dark92Enigma: UNACCEPTABLE
<Dark_Horst> i once built a houe in the style of a german normandy bunker
<PonyNegZero> (the amount of rustled jimmies is fantastic, please go on)
<Shizuka> 13the giant ones that stumble around begging give the rest a bad name
<Nittany_Discord> Not with many of them having personality tests. Fuck personality tests on job applications.
<oni_link> Oh I got it, build an underground house but have a window where the ocean is so you can see underwater!
<Dark_Horst> it looked bice
<Dark_Horst> *nice
<Dark_Horst> but then i lost the save file
<lol> Cool
<SpadeKyurem> I wish I had mine craft :'(
<Shizuka> 13my problem atm is references... have maybe one person i could use... need two>>
<The_Engineer> SPADE
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Agreed. And I do think they've gone way too far. I just think it's silly to go full tilt the other way and call 'em all evil when they rose to power primarily because they were needed due to corporate abuses.
<SpadeKyurem> Except I have no money or friends to giftcode me and begging you guys would be pathetic
<The_Engineer> GET A CRACK
<Dark92Enigma> Nittany_Discord: Personality tests in JOB APPLIANCES? where is the world going to?!
<The_Engineer> I bought the game though
<The_Engineer> :3
<Bronysith> Major: i aint doing shit for money, kids nowadays have no proper education and need to know that they dont have to go to college, that thats just an excuse for money to be sucked out from underneath them
<CriticKitten> I figure there's a nice big aisle in the middle and there's no need for extremism, black-and-whiting an issue that isn't black-and-white. :P
<CriticKitten> 's what it boils down to.
<String_Shredder> Hey, we're talking about America! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB6p5QPVhPI
<SpadeKyurem> I wish I had friends
<oni_link|birthday> I kinda don't want to work at a restaurant the rest of my life so I'm going to school after a year
*Bronysith takes SpadeKyurem to bed
<Nittany_Discord> Dark92Enigma: They've been around for decades. Mainly retail jobs where you have to interact with people, but I've seen them for Pizza Hut and even heard of them for IT jobs.
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: lets make you some
<Nittany_Discord> For disabled people like me, it's a barrier too high for jobs.
<Dark92Enigma> I can't believe i'm going to agree with the villain, but like the Joker said once: ''When you're doing someting, you're not doing it for free'' but THIS IS RIDICULOUS
<thelonepony> oni_link|birthday: today is your birthday :O
<oni_link|birthday> thelonepony: yep :3
<CriticKitten> SpadeKyurem: For starters, don't listen to Bronysith. He cray-cray. :P
<Nittany_Discord> I'm slow on tests, so I'll always fail those things.
<thelonepony> Happy Birthdat oni_link|birthday :)
<Major> Bronysith well at least I know our vote for president is pointless and that we should vote for representatives and not the president himself
*Bronysith carries CriticKitten to bed
<oni_link|birthday> thanks thelonepony
<thelonepony> birthday*
<Cynnivel> Happy birthday, oni_link|birthday~
<Deacon> Nittany_Discord that's a disability these days huh?
<SpadeKyurem> How good of a computer do you need to run Minecraft?
<Dark92Enigma> When you're good at something---*
<oni_link|birthday> thanks Cynnivel
<Shizuka> 13SpadeKyurem: not much, it's just CPU and RAM intensive
<Nittany_Discord> It's why I've chosen to go with disability placement, but even they may not find me anything.
<CriticKitten> Major: Nowadays Congress is the big deal.
<SpadeKyurem> How intensive?
<Dark92Enigma> happy birthday oni_link|birthday!
<Shizuka> 13discrete graphics helps but in the end it's Java that'll hold you back
<CriticKitten> That doesn't mean the presidency is meaningless, but having a good mix in Congress is critical.
<oni_link|birthday> thank you Dark92Enigma
<Nittany_Discord> Deacon: I have ADD and anxiety disorder.
<SpadeKyurem> And it fix that by?
<Shizuka> 13uh CPU spikes when chunks need updating, which is primarily redstone for normal play, gets bigger when you have mods on
<Shizuka> 13RAM it needs a lot
<Deacon> Nittany_Discord oh
<Bronysith> Deacon: what did you do to Aniki?
<SpadeKyurem> So a laptop aint gonna cut it
<Shizuka> 132-4GB to itself to start if you want the far rendering distance
<oni_link|birthday> It's kinda funny that facebook reminded me that today is my birthday today
<Shizuka> 13laptop can do it but it's laggy as hell
<Cynnivel> Depends on the laptop
<Shizuka> 13birthday!
<Cynnivel> My laptop runs Minecraft nice :3
<Deacon> Bronysith I just asked, though rude on my end though
<Bronysith> Deacon: be mean to him again and you are going to get a serious talking to
<Shizuka> 13takara is pretty bad at minecraft, mostly because intel integrated graphics and only 4GB ram to throw around
<oni_link|birthday> And I don't have plans other than going to work XD
<Shizuka> 13or is it 2..
<MadSurge> Happy birthday oni_link|birthday! :)
<Ryunosuke> so I found out a large chunk of why SC4 keeps crashing, seems it does NOT like mulit-core cpu's so you have to assign it to a single core :/
<oni_link|birthday> thanks MadSurge :3
<Bronysith> oni_link|birthday: yes, happy 1 year closer to death
<Shizuka> 13asuka's all right, though i've learned i can't use mystcraft or twilight forest cause both spam errors at the log until it dies
<Shizuka> 13and yep older games generally need affinity set
*Major gives oni_link|birthday a cake
<SpadeKyurem> Well I hope my desktop I'll be getting will play WoW with out lagging like shit
<Ryunosuke> actually I have not had any problems with that
<Ryunosuke> except for sc4
<oni_link|birthday> Bronysith: and also now I can legally consume a certain type of liquor XD
<oni_link|birthday> all of them XD
*oni_link|birthday noms on the cake Major made face first
<SpadeKyurem> Drink all the booze?
<oni_link|birthday> haha thats the plan this or next weekend SpadeKyurem
<MLP_Brovakiin> Happy birthday oni_link|birthday! :)
<CrystalPhoenix> I'm reading a book about anti-gravity. I just can't put it down.
<SpadeKyurem> My English teach is fucking insane
<oni_link|birthday> thanks MLP_Brovakiin
<SpadeKyurem> She expects me to read The Great Gatsby and write a 900-1500 word essay in a week
<jcelios> CrystalPhoenix: Fiction or Non-Fiction?
<thelonepony> SpadeKyurem: damn, she is crazy
<CrystalPhoenix> jcelios doesn't get it
<SpadeKyurem> the essay 300 points, the final exam is only 220
<CriticKitten> That reminds me, I need to add another HDD to this compy. Which means I'll need a name schema for my HDDs....hrm.
<SpadeKyurem> Thats not how grading works
<PonyNegZero> SpadeKyurem: don't worry, it gets better
<Fluffy> Happy birthday, oni_link|birthday
<jcelios> CrystalPhoenix: oh :P
<Ryunosuke> http://www.chimicherrychonga.com/2012/03/mlp-drink-cocktails.html -- this? :)
<AdamTheDuck> Happy birthday oni_link|birthday :P
<AdamTheDuck> Now I must depart, goodbye everyone. :3
<jcelios> CrystalPhoenix: I'm a science student as is most of the people I know, so hearing stuff like that meant literally is fairly common for me XD
<Cynnivel> Goodbye, AdamTheDuck~
<thelonepony> Ryunosuke: i think i'll be able to make VErdant Inferno :3
<thelonepony> Bye AdamTheDuck :3
<oni_link|birthday> thanks Fluffy
<CrystalPhoenix> jcelios, that's cool
<oni_link|birthday> thank you AdamTheDuck :3
<Ryunosuke> z:d
<CrystalPhoenix> and hey maybe you can tell that joke too to one of your friend at school
<Deacon> ah, seeya AdamTheDuck
<alexxm> bye AdamTheDuck
<jcelios> It would probably start an argument about anti-gravity XD
<jcelios> gravity is a touchy subject in physics atm...
<jcelios> theres probably a pun in there somewhere
<SpadeKyurem> gravity is a heavy subject
<jcelios> yup
<jcelios> there we go
<SpadeKyurem> It really weighs you down with work
<Freefall29> hello
<Deacon> lali-ho free
<thelonepony> Hi Freefall29
<Major> Gotta love that gravity
<Freefall29> so nothings happening right now?
<Deacon> seems like it
<Major> How is everypony?
<alexxm> i'm good Major ypu?
<bo0oring> Major, fine. how are you?
<Major> Good
<Major> Good once again :P
<Deacon> things are swell
<bo0oring> Cool.
<bo0oring> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0lgHh3TNAM&feature=g-subs-c
<Bronysith> bo0oring: you like ABR?
<StinkomanFan> THEORY: Ponies are actually hundreds of feet larger than humans and the "My Little Pony" from the title is spoken from Celestia's POV. Discuss.
<bo0oring> ABR? Dunno. I like heavy music.
<String_Shredder> StinkomanFan: Dafuq? that is all.
<Deacon> StinkomanFan interesting
<Bronysith> bo0oring: august burns red
<SpadeKyurem> Are the mods getting drunk or something?
<Bronysith> bo0oring: you just linked them
<bo0oring> Bronysith, ye, got you. right now found them on youtube
<bo0oring> Bronysith, sounds good. Never heard of them tho.
<Bronysith> bo0oring: they are my friends fav band...right behind metallica
<jcelios> StinkomanFan: It's always been my headcanon that the "My Little Pony" title and theme song are an ancient equestian childrens song
<bo0oring> Somehow they remind me of old Sliknot and Korn.
<bo0oring> Thing i going to love 'em.
<Cypresswolf> :) Wow! That's some front page news - that just made my day
<Kandarihu> jcelios, that's a really nice way to look at things.
<Deacon> Cypresswolf ah ,andrea libman?
<Cypresswolf> yep
<bo0oring> YAY! Drawing Training Grounds are back!
<bo0oring> damn, this AppleDash thing sure drawn good. Pity it just a clop
<jcelios> Pity Flutterdash is the OTP.
<bo0oring> what is OTP?
<bo0oring> oh w8
<jcelios> One True Pairing, I think
<Deacon> ja, it is
<SpadeKyurem> Onion Thinks Ponies
<bo0oring> :D
<bo0oring> i always wonder-how do i make myself to EQD Draw friend? Does they chose what to post?
<jcelios> I think they have people who go through new art and select them
<Deacon> iirc, you send them something via email, and they queue your art
<jcelios> maybe that too
<Cynnivel> Good art, knowing the people who do it, popularity, etc
<jcelios> they won't post anything though, so gotta filter through them
<alexxm> whats the twilight please picture from
<thelonepony> i believe from an old comic
<bo0oring> jcelios do you thing this will make it: http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/342/4/2/equestria_guard_by_aragarh-d5ngc3l.png

<SpadeKyurem> Screw patriotism
<Buytoast> I bet your has scuff marks and shit all over it.
<Buytoast> Blasphemy.
<weeping_pegasi82> GoldenMic well what is it trying to teach?
<oni_link> Buytoast mine is wearing my old ACUs
<jcelios> alexxm: oh I actually found it for real now http://coltsteelstallion.deviantart.com/art/twilight-say-pleaaase-329480346
<SpadeKyurem> I refuse to be patriotic to a country who elects morons and can't get it's shit together
<Buytoast> As long as that stands for American Cobbled Upholstry you won't be punished by the freedom police.
<Bronysith> what SpadeKyurem said
<jcelios> and the comic its from http://coltsteelstallion.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5fro9f
<SoulHeart> Hello?
<Stormy> I'm not sure what you mean by that
<Bronysith> jcelios: ha
<oni_link> hahaha American Cobbled Upholstery
*jcelios deactives google fu
<oni_link> thats a first
<SpadeKyurem> bored...
<jcelios> who is the OC pony DJinh?
<SoulHeart> I mean like a transformation into a dragon or a dragon from far off in the spyro universe. It really is cool when I have an idea to do in my spare time.
<jcelios> the bronystate one I assume
<jcelios> DJing
<Deacon> oh that's VioletVanilla
<jcelios> what about the guy with the Illustrator cutie mark?
<Kimori> You want to write a story?
<Deacon> tan one?
<jcelios> with the paint brush
<Deacon> that's Wrek
<jcelios> ah
<jcelios> haven't seen VioletVanilla around yet
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxyZaZlaOs Something to keep you fellers entertained in the mean time
<Deacon> heard her HDD went kaput, reason why she hasn't been on lately
<SoulHeart> I have one on paper and on Word, but if you want, we can here just tell me if I go a bit out with it.
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyurem, Oh gawd that video
<CrystalPhoenix> Squirrelking is best author
<SoulHeart> Also forgive me if I sound or act like a villian, okay
*SpadeKyurem finds Wepon
<CrystalPhoenix> I have to kill fast but bullets too slow
<oni_link> I love bad fanfic readings XD
<jcelios> which?
<CrystalPhoenix> jcelios, any bad fanfic reading
<jcelios> oh the Half life one
<CrystalPhoenix> one day, one mod should totally do some dramatic reading of bad fanfiction
<oni_link> ^^^
<thelonepony> the pants were ded
<CrystalPhoenix> any series
<SpadeKyurem> Hellfirecoms does that
<jcelios> But where would be find any bad pony fanfiction :o
<jcelios> not possible
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsbUL6DZOtk Heres another good one
<Stormy> Was it just me or did that person make no sense?
<CrystalPhoenix> jcelios, oh there are many horrible fanfiction of MLP
<Deacon> jcelios fimfiction?
<Buytoast> where would they find any GOOD pony fan fiction
<Deacon> Buytoast fimfiction?
<CrystalPhoenix> just go in fimfiction and search for the largest dislike bar
<Stormy> Did they want to roleplay or something?
<SpadeKyurem> CrystalPhoenix: I dont think thats how it works
<jcelios> next time I'm going to use /s
<CriticKitten> ...darnit, I miss Vivi. ;-;
<CrystalPhoenix> or get a crossover in here http://www.fanfiction.net/
<SpadeKyurem> 50 shades of grey is worst fanfic
<Kimori> English might be a 2nd language for him
<Bronysith> pretty much
<Bronysith> it is a fanfic of a fanfic after all
<Dark92Enigma> jcelios: there's one with a HUMAN joining Twi in the Canterlot Wedding. she (the human) has no relevance in the story whatsoever, and she's basically there just to talk and add quotes
<MadSurge> Who's the OC with the trident thing and all the books? *dumb*
<Bronysith> MadSurge: thats valthejean
<Dark92Enigma> hold on.......
<SpadeKyurem> MadSurge: Val I think
<Bronysith> AKA caramel
<SpadeKyurem> Damn it
<Kimori> and hi Stormy :P didnt see you login earlier
<Stormy> lol, hi :P
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: gimme money
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsbUL6DZOtk This is a hilarious animation a fanfic
<jcelios> I listened to a dramatic reading of some fanfic where twilight goes back to magic kindergarden and wears a diaper and constantly shits herself. It was riveting.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/NM7yn.jpg
<SpadeKyurem> *of a
<Kimori> I picked up another vintage Atari computer today
<Stormy> and yeah, that's true
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: Caramel. The one with the glowing eyes is VAL
<Dark92Enigma> MadSurge: his alter ego
<Kimori> lol
<Kimori> I remember that show
<Deacon> Dark92Enigma wait wha?
<jcelios> I got the disturbing feeling it was meant to be erotic...
<Kimori> http://www.comichammer.com/forum/download/file.php?id=2&sid=feab2ec4c5799c466a438b04d9fa7de2
<MadSurge> Ah thanks guys ^^ I can identify the others fine, but not that one :D
<Bronysith> jcelios: 50 shades of grey?
<jcelios> 50 Shades of Brown
<Bronysith> 50 shades of grey is not a proper example of BDSM
<CrystalPhoenix> http://www.fanfiction.net/crossovers/My-Little-Pony/621/ choose your poison
<MadSurge> Bronysith: but a perfect example of sadomasochism
<Bronysith> MadSurge: no it is not
<Dark92Enigma> Deacon: i'll explain: it's just like Jekyll and Hyde. Caramel is Jekyll (the nice guy) VAL is Hyde (the monster)
<Kimori> hi amu-chan
<MadSurge> Bronysith: yes it is, if you decide to read ir
<SpadeKyurem> You have to remember someone somewhere is getting off to it
<MadSurge> *it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/qa9mx.png
<Bronysith> MadSurge: i have a few friends in BDSM, one whos been on the scene for 18 years, he says it is not a proper representation of anything to do with BDSM
<jcelios> "friends
<jcelios> "
<Dark92Enigma> Deacon: when he comes in as Caramel, he's nice and playful, when VAL comes in, he trolls us---just because
<Kandarihu> I always figured the blue OC is Phase4.
<Kimori> hah
<Deacon> Dark92Enigma well, odd
<MadSurge> Bronysith: I know, but I meant that it's so painful to read you might as well get a cat o' nin e tails and hit yourself
<alexxm> whos the oc in bandages then
<Bronysith> MadSurge: thats just masochism then, not sado masochism
<oni_link> Ghosties I think
<MadSurge> alexxm: Ghosties
<Dark92Enigma> the blue OC with the videogame ghosts is SuperBrony64
<alexxm> thanks oni_link and MadSurge
<Dark92Enigma> my bad, Ghosties
<alexxm> oh and happy birthday oni_link
<MadSurge> ^
<oni_link> thanks alexxm
<Dark92Enigma> Deacon: my bad, i just realized that the OC in bandages is Ghosties.......:$ sorry :(
<MadSurge> :D dat PLEEEEEEEASE image
<Dark92Enigma> Deacon: BUT MY THEORY still stands
<SpadeKyurem> Man its boring around here
<Deacon> oh, it was a theory
<Bronysith> BDSM is so awesome
<MadSurge> Also dat BaconMane
<CrystalPhoenix> http://youtu.be/SwpUvVNu4Wo
<jcelios> Common Mantra of BDSM community is "Safe Sane Consensual" If it's not that its probably just a fictional fantasy or some fringe.
<Dark92Enigma> Deacon: it still counts. just ask Caramel (when he shows up next summer)
<Dark92Enigma> you'll notice
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIg3rygMAuk Ahem...Gentlemen?
<Dark92Enigma> jcelios: who WROTE THAT?
<oni_link> SpadeKyurem: hahaha
<jcelios> Dark92Enigma: wrote what?
<oni_link> *snort* magic
<Dark92Enigma> LOL :D
<Dark92Enigma> jcelios: that fic of Twi going to kindergarten
<jcelios> oh
<jcelios> lemme see if I can find it
<Bronysith> i think dr eggman is one of the worst doctors ever
<Dark92Enigma> lemme see if i can find that other s****y fic
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: I guess he was set to be.
<Deacon> Bronysith I'll say, what is he doctor of anyway?
<SpadeKyurem> Deacon: Science
<CrystalPhoenix> Seriously this is great. http://youtu.be/SwpUvVNu4Wo
<SpadeKyurem> Robotnik builds impressive shit, shame none of it actually works
<Bronysith> isnt it awesome how dr wily built Zero?
<Bronysith> and became friends with X?
<Bronysith> Zero did of course XD
<Bronysith> and he was designed to destroy megaman
<SpadeKyurem> and isnt it ironic Zero made Light's dream a reality?
<Bronysith> SpadeKyurem: i love megaman X4
<alexxm> what was that dream?
<SpadeKyurem> For Humans and reploids to live in peace
<SpadeKyurem> He acomplished that esentally at the end of Z4
<jcelios> Dark92Enigma: found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTS4gQPZPyA
<jcelios> dat thumbnail :O
<alexxm> so Dark92Enigma do you think it's a good idea that the intercontental and united states championship scenes are intwined at the moment
<oni_link> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=i74ZY24UHrw&feature=endscreen
<Derpingtons> Dafaq is going on.

<oni_link> SpadeKyurem: you can't be serious XD
<Bronysith> shush
<SpadeKyurem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XArZMprx2qM
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm: IMO i just hope that they don't unify the titles
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat BronyState
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma they probably won't but i think it's good as it could lead to some intresting matches
<oni_link> dat SuperBrony64 :o
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:o
<thelonepony> :O

<Dusky> lurk on, #bronystate
<Haku1013> Saturn next to The Doctor WHo theme of course
<Haku1013> gamax92 Ive been here, just on the sidelines
<gamax92> Haku1013: Remember some guy named DoctorWhoves who wanted to draw us some oc in pencil?
<Haku1013> I got mine
<Haku1013> I look fucking adorable
<gamax92> Do you have the link to his deviantart because i left before he finished mine
<Haku1013> sure hold on
<Saturn> 08,01Haku1013: nope
<Saturn> 08,01doctor who sucks
<Saturn> 08,01it cannot compare to the awesomeness of SG1
<thelonepony> tis your opinion
<Haku1013> WHAT
<Haku1013> NO NO NO
<Haku1013> HE CHALLEGES FACTS
<thelonepony> Haku1013: repsect it
*gamax92 shakes Haku1013 FOCUS!
<Bronysith> Saturn: you said dr who is just fun right? but not good sci fi
<Haku1013> Doctor Who is 2nd best show ever
<Bronysith> whats the first?
<Haku1013> With best theme ever
<Haku1013> Ponies, of course
<Bronysith> hahahahaha
<Bronysith> no
<Bronysith> ponies, though amazing, no where near the best show ever
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Animation: Statued Discord Replies - Friend Like Me
<Bronysith> i still think batman the animated series or animaniacs are the best show
<Haku1013> Bronysith the internet has spoken, Ponies is best show
<Haku1013> Whats best is defined by how influencial the show is. Name 1 show more influencial than Doctor Who, the longest running tv series ever
<Bronysith> meh
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: aye
<xles> Ponies are good, but I'm not sure I'd count them in the top 10 best ever shows. Not even sure about top 10 cartoons.
<Bronysith> Quantity=/=quality
<xles> Speaking entirely objectively on the matter.
<Haku1013> Its the longest running FOR A REASON
<Saturn> 08,01it does give scifi a bad name, in my opinion
<Bronysith> Haku1013: then by that logic, simpsons is best animated show ever
<Bronysith> holy fuck
<Bronysith> does current simpsons suck
<gamax92> Batman!
<gamax92> Bronysith: so true ...
<Haku1013> Ill be the last person to say Quantiy is the same as quality
<Haku1013> But DW is the longest running for a reason
<Bronysith> Saturn: what other scifi is good to get into? you said battlestar galactica right?
<xles> My favourite Simpsons episode is from season 2... Just sayin'...
<Bronysith> season 2? really?
<xles> I think it's season 2, yeah.
<Haku1013> Simpsons is like Family Guy; its a long running show because its stupid funny
<Bronysith> no
<xles> uhm
<Bronysith> simpsons was really REALLY REALLY FUCKING GOOD
<Haku1013> not saying its humor is the same
<gamax92> Family Guy is stupid
<Bronysith> now it is just stupid like family guy
<Bronysith> before simpsons had its own creative humor
<xles> Yeah, season 2.
<Haku1013> Its humor is stupid funny. Thats why its popular and still watched, because its a great series.
<Bronysith> now it is like family guy by using already established jokes from youtube or internet or some stupid shit like that
<xles> Episode 1, season 2, even. "Bart gets an F". Absolutely brilliant episode.
<Bronysith> current simpsons sucks
<Bronysith> xles: oh yea
<gamax92> I agree with Bronysith and xles
<Haku1013> Simpsons WAS the greatest animated series, but todays doesnt compare to the older episodes
<Bronysith> todays simpsons episodes purely suck
<gamax92> old cartoons generally seem to be better than newer ones.
<Bronysith> suck so goddamn much
<xles> I know his pain, so well there. Do your very best, and yet you're not good enough to pass. Your best - isn't good enough. Heartbreaking episode.
<Haku1013> and its the new simpsoms that drag it
<Haku1013> down
<TheGentleManBrony> I usually don't like humanized ponies but I really like humanized Lyra for some reason
<gamax92> Question, what vector program do you guys recommend.
<Haku1013> gamax92 Thats simply because the shows that we grew up with stick with us more than the new ones. A lot fo the old shows, although good, werent great.
<Bronysith> but the simpsons just needs to end
<Haku1013> End it with another movie
<gamax92> I'm thinking between inkscape and paint too sai
<xles> gamax92: Counter question, what is the intended use of it?
<gamax92> Currently, retracing over pencil. Later when i get a tablet, drawing things.
<xles> For illustration I use Inkscape.
<Haku1013> Also gamax92 heres the link I forgot to put up http://unnamed1234.deviantart.com/
<gamax92> kthx
<Bronysith> the original simpsons was amazing, current simpsons is just being family guy
<Haku1013> ^
<xles> Bronysith: Exactly.
<xles> Was brilliant, turned into shit grind.
<gamax92> DSFSDf dslfjskfj skdfjkafnkadfndsf he didn't upload mine
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<gamax92> wat
<Dark92Enigma-> hi AJIsAwesome!
<Bronysith> but the question is
<Bronysith> why is south park still good?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Sketch_Toku_Brony and Dark92Enigma-. :)
<thelonepony> Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<xles> Bronysith: Writing staff.
<gamax92> so inkscape you guys say?
<thelonepony> hi AJIsAwesome :)
<Bronysith> cause they do all the things that i was just complaining about with current simpsons
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, thelonepony. :)
<Bronysith> but its good CAUSE THE WRITING IS GOOD
<jcelios> well I like to use Inkscape for diagrams a lot :_
<jcelios> :)
<Dark92Enigma-> Bronysith: the writing, nuff' said
<jcelios> nothing like SVG diagrams!
<xles> gamax92: It's a bit quirky at times, but for illustration it's nice. Don't know about straight up drawing in it though.
<Bronysith> i cant wait for the new south park RPG
<Haku1013> South Park is family guy humor on steroids
<gamax92> Well I'll keep pts on hand, but I'll try out inkscape.
<jcelios> most of the time I see people drawing in photoshop with tablets
<Bronysith> Haku1013: except done right
<gamax92> my god ... 75KB's
<gamax92> whats wrong with my internet
*gamax92 slaps gamax92
<Haku1013> Because Humor on steroids is always funny. Ex: Animainacs
<Bronysith> hell yea
<Bronysith> animaniacs is just
<Bronysith> pure
<Bronysith> fun
<xles> Animatiacs were awesome.
<gamax92> amen
<Bronysith> you cant watch that show without smiling
<Bronysith> no i dare you
<Bronysith> watch a full episode of animaniacs, and dont smile
<xles> I can, but I'm also an emotional robot.
<gamax92> Bronysith: can i just pay you 20$ instead
<Bronysith> sure you wont be on your ass laughing, but you will have a smile
<Bronysith> gamax92: sure
<Ryunosuke> Bronysith: impossibru
<jcelios> what if I have a muscle condition in my FAAAACE!?
<Bronysith> gamax92: need my paypal?
<gamax92> no I'll just put some money in winrar and send the file to you.
<xles> I would love to see that show do a comeback, but I fear that the comedic style in Animaniacs would fit our times. Amazingly enough, I think it may have too much substance. =(
<Bronysith> no
<xles> Wouldn't*
<Bronysith> It can never come back
<jcelios> too much substance abuse
<xles> I can't type. =(
<Bronysith> most of the writers went their own ways
<gamax92> "ITS TOO FUNNY, IM DIEING OF LAUGHTE * ugh"
<xles> jcelios: Been snorting graphite all day. That must be why I can't type.
<Bronysith> animaniacs is just pure fun, but then
<Bronysith> theres Batman TAS
<Bronysith> that show is just
<Bronysith> epic
<jcelios> graphite? pure lead straight to the eye ball
<Haku1013> if they DO make a comeback, the intro has to start off telling us all that we've waited long enough for the 101 episode
<xles> Bronysith: If it were to come back it would be the same disaster as the Futurama comeback. =/
<gamax92> jcelios: thats not funny
<Bronysith> xles: of course
<gamax92> my mom got lead in her eye
<kidzrul732> My brain is full of fuck right now. i can barely think straight
<Bronysith> current futurama, family guy, and simpsons
<Haku1013> I like JLU better than Batman TAS
<Bronysith> suck
<jcelios> gamax92: how'd that happen?
<xles> Amen.
<Haku1013> Bronystih Futurama doesnt have the same humor as Family Guy. Granted theyre on the borders, but they still mange to have a slightly different humor that makes them different
<gamax92> NOOOO inkscape slowed down to 54KB's
<gamax92> Bronysith: Why does my internet hate me
<xles> gamax92: Not enough samurai ponies: http://xles.deviantart.com/art/Ponirai-342311649

<xles> Bronysith: haha

<Bronysith> samurais suck
<xles> "You suck!"
<Haku1013> Samurai Jack
<Bronysith> Gum Do sword mastery for life
<Haku1013> PUIRE AWESOME
<gamax92> wow xles ...
<gamax92> thats kinda good
<Haku1013> *pure
<Ryunosuke> Usagi Yojimbo (though technically a Ronin)
<Bronysith> Gum do was incredibly fucking fun
<Haku1013> Samurai Jack was just amazing.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<Bronysith> cant believe i got banned from the school though >.>
<Haku1013> Bobobo-bobobobo was also funny
<Ryunosuke> Bronysith: downloading porn again? :)
<xles> Ryunosuke: Half decent for a programmer eh? ;)
<gamax92> I got suspended from school for accidently overloading the network.
<AJIsAwesome> Haku1013: Oh, I LOVED that show.
<Bronysith> Ryunosuke: no i got banned from my Gum Do dojo
<Ryunosuke> its not bad, but it's no wrek :0
<Ryunosuke> :)
<gamax92> I got like 12 people to go load up a round of Ace of Spades
<xles> Hehe
<Haku1013> nyeh
<Ryunosuke> Bronysith: ah
<Bronysith> i was thrown out, for a good reason though
<xles> Well, I know I can't draw worth a bit. But that wont stop me from pretending I can.
<gamax92> So now when I host the server I have to put a cap on the bandwith the server uses.
<Bronysith> to be fair
<Ryunosuke> okay a few questions Bronysith, what kind of school was it?
<Bronysith> Ryunosuke: martial arts school
<xles> Too much hadouken?
<xles> ...or not enough?
<Bronysith> lets just say my sparring partners were waaaay too weak
<xles> ...You went Cobra Kai on their ass, didn't you...
<Ryunosuke> oh
<Bronysith> not only breaking her sword, but landing a blow on her face
<Ryunosuke> I was thinking more of .... Gohei from kenshin
<xles> Did you yell "NO MERCY!", and sweep her leg?
<Bronysith> nope
<Bronysith> my form was too berserkish
<Ryunosuke> http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120306140447/kenshin/images/9/9e/Gohei.jpg -- this guy? :)
<Bronysith> fuck that
<Ryunosuke> i meant in the fashion that he got kicked out of the Kamiya School :p
<xles> For today's submission for the advent sketch mare-a-thon a friends of mine and I are doing, I drew fluttershy with a beard and hat.
<Ryunosuke> BY FLUTTERSHY'S BEARD
<Ryunosuke> :p
<xles> Fake beard, but still.

<Ryunosuke> thats pretty good
*xles may be starting to learn how to use them pencils.
<Bronysith> though on my own, cause i dont want to hurt anyone XD
<xles> Ryunosuke: If you're brave enough you can click back through the past 11 days and check my progress from December 1st. I must warn you, it get worse pretty fast. =P
*SpadeKyurem bursts through the roof of the chat room
<SpadeKyurem> HUZZAH!

<SpadeKyurem> the off stream buffer thing needs more random images
<SpadeKyurem> Ok I have a question, that englishman saying a meme in old english is a meme right? What is it called?
<xles> Never did learn to draw as a kid. Figured it was childish and complete hokum. "Who needs art anyway, bah humbug" and so forth. In later years however... What is life without art? And what better way to preserve artforms than learn to practise them? *ohdear*
<SpadeKyurem> Some times I question art
<SpadeKyurem> most of it looks like a mess
<haseo348> mods are asleep arent they?
<SpadeKyurem> I bet all the mods are partying on Mod Island
<X_865> most likely
<xles> It's an operator party, and none of us are invited.
<thelonepony> well, that means we have to make a Party on our own then

<Bronysith> but 47
<Bronysith> what does 47 have to do with anything?
<Navy_Numbers> I'm not good at anything. It started out as joke with the 47 cutie mark but has just stayed that way ever since.

<Navy_Numbers> jcelios: Your OC is bad and you should feel bad
<Caramel> I suddenly feel that http://www.dorkly.com/video/43504/sonic-meets-an-oc is now relevant
<jcelios> the kids these days, bad = good right?
<Bronysith> Sephiroth, though a decent villain, is incredibly overrated
<Bronysith> not as good as kefka
<Navy_Numbers> What are you? 10 years old or something jcelios?
<Bronysith> cause kefka is best villain of final fantasy, if not ever
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Bronysith> jcelios: yea seriously, how old are you?
<Shizuka> 13well... i *was* hopeful for the live action aelita
<jcelios> Navy_Numbers: my mom told me not to give out my age over the internet!
<spypengen> I'm "18"
*Bronysith hides in Megas in vault 8324
<spypengen> and hello everypony!
<Punkie_Pue> hi spypengen
<thelonepony> Hi spypengen
<Navy_Numbers> jcelios: Ok then your totally not anywhere near 14 then if you listen to your parents.
<jcelios> yeah, I mean I'm 18
<spypengen> no you're "18"
<Bronysith> jcelios: dat fat lie
<spypengen> that means not 18
<spypengen> but you're just saying 18
<twilight_squirtle> jcelios: could you repost your oc please? i just got here and what to see whats wrecking everyone's jimmies
<jcelios> look, time is relative anyway
<Shizuka> 13the CG is better but they should have kept the same VAs
<jcelios> TA DA: http://i.imgur.com/lzxUp.png
<twilight_squirtle> ah ok lel
<sub06905> Caramel: :D all dem ocs
<SpadeKyurem> Oh hey Shizuka
<twilight_squirtle> almost as good as my glorious oc
*Bronysith licks Caramel
<Shizuka> 13*sigh*
<Shizuka> 13guess season 4 will still be the last season of lyoko
<Bronysith> Shizuka: wat? code lyoko?
<Caramel> careful bronysith, you might get super pregnant
<thelonepony> twilight_squirtle: that "good" oc that blachi made for you?
<Navy_Numbers> Dat Caramel
<Bronysith> Caramel: of course i want your baby
<Buytoast> Code Lyoko is still going on?
<Buytoast> I thought that show ended years ago
<Shizuka> 13fifth season is coming
<sub06905> Tailz is best OC
*CriticKitten looks at the movie trailer
<CriticKitten> ....
<twilight_squirtle> thelonepony: thats the second form of my oc, first is that paint one
<Shizuka> 13live action, retcons XANA back into existence after he was utterly destroyed in the series finale
<CriticKitten> Why is there ANY live action in that?!?
<Kandarihu> Oh, I didn't know Lyoko is still going on.
<Bronysith> ...
<CriticKitten> It looks like SHIT.
<Bronysith> ....................
<spypengen> lemme show you guys my OC
*Bronysith grabs an evoker
<CriticKitten> The CG is fantastic, mind, but the live action bits....
<Buytoast> live action Code Lyoko?
*Bronysith places against temple
<Buytoast> oh dear
<CriticKitten> Are just....
*Bronysith shoots himself in the head, summoning his persona that is a tonberry
<CriticKitten> ARGH. They look like a high school film project!
<Bronysith> KILL THE WRITERS
<Shizuka> 13they SOUND like a high school film project..
<Shizuka> 13nothing will compare to sharon mann
<CriticKitten> And the....lip sync....?
<Shizuka> 13well it's a french show
<spypengen> here's my OC http://i.imgur.com/9le0W.png
<Dark92Enigma-> WAIT! A live action Code Lyoko? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
<Shizuka> 13animation lets you get away with it, live action not so much
<Bronysith> code lyoko is french?
<spypengen> and it's best OC
<CriticKitten> i know, but it's so....
<CriticKitten> Bad
<Bronysith> spypengen: kill yourself
<CriticKitten> It took me a second viewing to really appreciate how bad. ._.
<Bronysith> code lyoko has some fun ideas
<Navy_Numbers> I thought you had an OC as well Bronysith. Or are you a OC hater?
<Bronysith> its just not as good as i remember it
<spypengen> well I tried :'(
<Dark92Enigma-> Code Lyoko is fine just as it is! it doesn't need a ''Winx Club'' revival, or something like that!
<CriticKitten> Man. If not for the CG bits, I'd be lining that film up to take its rightful place as the right hand of The Last Airbender in the Hall of Fucking Shame
<Bronysith> Navy_Numbers: not an oc, just a character a friend drew for me
<Bronysith> Navy_Numbers: i am not having an official OC, ever
<CriticKitten> Because the live action stuff is just so awful. It kills the movie for me and I haven't even seen it yet. ._.
<CriticKitten> What a shame. >.<
<Navy_Numbers> Bronysith: Oh yeah that's right. Wasn't it based off of that fanfic you wrote or something?
<Shizuka> 13lyoko is like modern tron
<Bronysith> Navy_Numbers: god, that fanfic.
<Shizuka> 13only better graphics and variety
<Bronysith> fucking sucks dry ass
<Shizuka> 13it'll probably do better in france where people are used to the face build
<twilight_squirtle> dry ass... wat
<Dark92Enigma-> Shizuka: and story-wise, how is it?
<Shizuka> 13some of us liked the giant foreheads
<Critchley> why nothing on teh stream :(
<Bronysith> Shizuka: you mean heads that dont match the bodies?
<Bronysith> BIG FUCKIGN HEADS
<Shizuka> 13at some point i might start season 3 and 4 for stream
<jcelios> of what?
<Shizuka> 13sumi did a bit of season 1 but that's their weakest
<CriticKitten> Yeah, but it's just such a damn shame.
<Buytoast> man i used to be addicted to obsesed with Code Lyoko
<Shizuka> 13i never kept season 2 either cause it was just "capture and possess aelita, friends arrive just barely in time"
<CriticKitten> With CG like that, you just know it could've been so much better
<Buytoast> i don't even know why
<Navy_Numbers> Bronysith: I remember you suggested I read it. I did. To be honest it wasn't that bad.
<Dark92Enigma-> Shizuka: i remember you told us so....
<Shizuka> 13but 3 and 4 are fantastic
<Bronysith> Navy_Numbers: looking back on it, now that i got some official writing tips...yea...it sucks
<Bronysith> dry mucky warthog ass
<Shizuka> 133 does awesome plot development with slowly removing sectors of lyoko, and 4 has the internet which is actually underwater
<Buytoast> you know, i never saw the series finale of code lyoko
<CriticKitten> Plus, on a minor note....is it REALLY a good idea to use the same naming schema for your movie as Dragonball Z did for their live action movie?
<Bronysith> fuck that shit
<CriticKitten> Do you WANT to remind people about that shitty movie before they even enter the theater? XD
<Navy_Numbers> Bronysith: I can't write stories for squat! XD
<Dark92Enigma-> so lemme get this straight.....there's a live action CODE LYOKO MOVIE?........WHY!?
<Navy_Numbers> Don't even get me started on what I tried to write once -_-
<Bronysith> Navy_Numbers: at least you didnt start
<Bronysith> and never finish
<Bronysith> like biglaw
<CriticKitten> Because it worked so well for Dragonball Evolution, Dark92Enigma
<Bronysith> goddamnit
<CriticKitten> Obviously. :D
<Dark92Enigma-> i swear CriticKitten if that movie you just mentioned EVER MAKES IT HERE. it should get the rifftrax treatment! (there is a riff)
<Navy_Numbers> Bronysith: I did start it but then tossed it out before I even finshed the first paragraph.
<Dark92Enigma-> in progress*
<Bronysith> ha
<Shizuka> 13haha found it
<Dark92Enigma-> CriticKitten: so it ''worked'' for that movie....is it the same guy who directed Final Destination?
<CriticKitten> Actually, since TLA isn't on the WMC list....I was thinking of voting for that :D
<Dark92Enigma-> Shizuka: i knew you would....what did you found?
<Bronysith> find
<Shizuka> 13http://youtu.be/HBXQHbM8WNc?t=11m8s
<Dark92Enigma-> Bronysith: thanks :$
<Bronysith> god why is sephiroth such a pussy
<Dark92Enigma-> sorry, find*?
<Shizuka> 13much of the awesomeness of season 4 packed into one sequence
<Dark92Enigma-> YESSSSSSSS
<Shizuka> 13i must have that liftoff theme too...
<Bronysith> i have so many video game soundtracks i need to download to my iphone
<Bronysith> and such
<Bronysith> also, one of the reasons i liked code lyoko, it was like a video game
<Bronysith> but looking back on it, it is not as good as i remember it...unfortunetlye
<Shizuka> 13http://youtu.be/YVGnEZH5syc well not quite the liftoff theme but still good
<otakon> hiya Shizuka
*Bronysith sits on otakon

<Buytoast> the most original of color schemes
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Oh, wait. I gotta see this OC. brb
<otakon> spypengen: but a very common color scheme
<spypengen> well I like red and my hair is black and the green matches the cute mark
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Could be worse.
<spypengen> so that's my reasoning for the color scheme
<Bronysith> ...

<Ponies47> Soulless_DCLXVI: I have no tallent IRL so the 47 cutie mark was just a thing because of my nickname

<thelonepony> AttackWithHugs: which is awesome :3
<AttackWithHugs> Ohai Sithy~
<Critchley> they look sooooo ... generic
<Ponies47> thelonepony: :$
<Dusky> pony maker ponies, yay!
<Bronysith> Critchley: afterall, pony creator discourages creativity
<Critchley> its good for people who want quick oc's
*Dusky prances around with a decently high fever ^_^
<jcelios> Bronysith: Rosy Retrospection is the term in psychology, it's a big part of that effect.
<LT_SKINNY> I never could make my own... Couldnt find a decent maltese cross for my cutie mark :(
<Critchley> but you can ask most people on deviant art and they will draw an oc for u
<Soulless_DCLXVI> If I had ANY talent in drawing, I wouldn't use a pony creator. But alas, I have none.
<Bronysith> Critchley: or who cant draw or have friends who can draw for them
<LadyCanary> To me, it gives a good starting base for those who want to draw their OCs. Gives them a clearer picture.
<LadyCanary> Plus, would make it easier for other artists to draw it.
<AttackWithHugs> .....I made my OC using pony creato and use it as a reference for the colors when i finally draw it....
<AttackWithHugs> does that make me a bad person?
<emantrollslayer> no
<Bronysith> i guess, but wouldnt it be better for sketches?
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<otakon> no it does not
<Critchley> no it doesnt lol
<Canadian_Brony> LadyCanary *cough* sprite animation *cough
<Critchley> i just dont like pony creator oc's xD
<emantrollslayer> YES IT DOES YOU'RE A HORRIBLE PERSON :V
<LadyCanary> I'd love a lil sprite one day ^_^
<AJIsAwesome> emantrollslayer: D:
<otakon> me too
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: im sure Vordox would do it XD
<emantrollslayer> hmmmmmm....
<otakon> but I haz no skills
<thelonepony> same here

<Vordox> What Bronysith ?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Why does it seem like most everypony on tonight is in a real sh** mood?
<thelonepony> but i suck at sprites ;3;
<emantrollslayer> LadyCanary what about a little perler of your OC?
<Ponies47> My OC started in Pony Creator and went through multiple versions but the version I have at the moment I'm happy with ^_^
<Bronysith> otakon: you are pretty kick ass at mass effect 3 multiplayer, that shit gets hard on gold
<LadyCanary> A what?
<AJIsAwesome> Soulless_DCLXVI: I'm not.
<emantrollslayer> LadyCanary the little beads that you can iron together
<LadyCanary> OH.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> :)
<LT_SKINNY> :P
<LadyCanary> Nah. Not that.
<emantrollslayer> they're really cool though ;__;
*emantrollslayer made a schweet fluttershy
<Bronysith> otakon: i mean you usually play on gold or diamond right?
<Canadian_Brony> LadyCanary you want me to make a sprite for you? It's the least I can do with Christmas rolling around.
<otakon> Bronysith: platinim and no
<otakon> I suck at Gold and Plat
<LadyCanary> :O
<Bronysith> ahh
<LadyCanary> Oh gosh.
<Bronysith> Canadian_Brony: how nice of you
<Canadian_Brony> :)
<emantrollslayer> Bronysith well he IS canadian
<LadyCanary> T-thank you!
<emantrollslayer> they're all nice
<Bronysith> false
<Bronysith> also that is really fuckign stereotypical
<emantrollslayer> STEREOTYPES
<Canadian_Brony> emantrollslayer *sigh* come see my high school.
<Canadian_Brony> "nice" does not exist there
<emantrollslayer> Canadian_Brony hey man, feel free to throw stereotypes back at me. I love stereotype jokes
<emantrollslayer> and that's because high school
<Bronysith> Canadian_Brony: thats america for ya, they use stereotypes to raise kids
<emantrollslayer> "I fell off my igloo and I broke my knee. Dont worry, here in canada it's free."
<Bronysith> otakon: whats with all the characters in chrono trigger having scarves?
<emantrollslayer> let's go to the hospital*
<sub06905> lel http://bakingbites.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/nomskulls.jpg
<LT_SKINNY> We even have stereotypes for ourselves! We're that pessimistic
<Canadian_Brony> Canadian. Brony. Nerd. Teenager. Bisexual. My list goes on.
<emantrollslayer> Canadian_Brony you mean your list of awesomeness?
<thelonepony> sub06905: i ma get that >:3
<Bronysith> though stereotypes and racism is developed from experience
<emantrollslayer> Canadian_Brony excpet for the teenager part
<Bronysith> and for sometimes good reason
<Canadian_Brony> emantrollslayer those are my stereotypes. Awesomeness is much, /MUCH/ longer.
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, not always.
<Canadian_Brony> :p
<Bronysith> otakon: whats with all the characters in chrono trigger having scarves?
<emantrollslayer> man, I really need to make more perlers soon. I have a dr whooves half done but I dont have enough brown beads ><
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: i mean, if a kid say is bullied by mexicans or asians throughout his/her whole life, they might assume that all asians or mexicans are bad
<LT_SKINNY> Bronysith: Thats if their parents didnt put that in their heads first :/
<Bronysith> LT_SKINNY: developed
<Bronysith> that is still developed
<Bronysith> experiences, etc
<LT_SKINNY> Yeah. But Im just saying that most racism starts in the home
<emantrollslayer> LT_SKINNY racism=/= stereotype
<emantrollslayer> I hate that more than anything
<twilight_squirtle> LT_SKINNY: doesnt have to be, people arent exactly unbiased. some bad personal experience can suffice
<Bronysith> racism= false assumption that one race is better than another
<emantrollslayer> you can be stereotypical without being racist
<emantrollslayer> Bronysith racism= discrimination or lack there of due to someone's race
<Bronysith> stereotype=all black people eat fried chicken
<Bronysith> emantrollslayer: nope
<emantrollslayer> yes
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: It's not false. Charr > other races....oh wait, you mean in real life
<emantrollslayer> Bronysith Racism: Prejudice or discrimination directed against someone of a different race based on such a belief.
<LT_SKINNY> Well I heard Bronysith talking about Asians and Mexicans so I assumed we were on racism :P
<Canadian_Brony> wast
<LT_SKINNY> my bad
<Canadian_Brony> *wat
<CriticKitten> ....nope, gonna stick with my original answer even then. Charr are still best race.
<emantrollslayer> Canadian_Brony oh, I thought you said weast
<emantrollslayer> dooode
<emantrollslayer> CriticKitten
<emantrollslayer> wazzup
<Canadian_Brony> I don't know what I said
<CriticKitten> Not much.
<Bronysith> oh hey it is Wrek kicking ass as a mini mech
<otakon> bah I keep getting stream stutter
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Who/what are the Charr?
<AttackWithHugs> Oh shoot, just saw Deadmau5 on that commercial advertising those Sonos speakers
<CriticKitten> Kitty people.
<Bronysith> so otakon why do all teh characters in chrono trigger wear scarves?
<Bronysith> i just realized that
*LadyCanary sighs
<LadyCanary> <3
<CriticKitten> Except with sexy voices.
<emantrollslayer> LadyCanary ?
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Kewl.
<CriticKitten> Steven Blum is a charr, therefore all arguments are invalid.
<emantrollslayer> CriticKitten what are you going on about?
<LadyCanary> Ded.
<Ryunosuke> hey LadyCanary, whats wrong?
<Wrek> 05that BADABUMMM guy is so obviously using hacks its silly :|
<LadyCanary> Nothing!

<Canadian_Brony> hey LadyCanary, you gonna send me a pic of your OC? I was serious about that you know.
<Ryunosuke> oh you sighed :)
<LadyCanary> Sure!
<CriticKitten> eman: Shhh, I'm derailing the racism discussion with my nonsense.
<LadyCanary> Because Wrek was in a mini mech destroying everything >////<
<Soulless_DCLXVI> And for that, we thank you.
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: steve blum? the voice of orochimaru (and other characters from that shit anime naruto) and Jamie from megas xlr, LEeron from gurren lagann steve blum?
<Ryunosuke> oh well not EVERYTHING :p

<Bronysith> CriticKitten: yay, hes sexy
<Canadian_Brony> congrats Wrek. You have proven to us once again that you are a badass.
*KrazyNoobs needs a dispenser here
<CriticKitten> eman: Only against humans. Charr are best race because Steven Blum is one, also kitty people.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> He voiced Tom the Rock? Damn... that's talent.
<emantrollslayer> I'm not racist
<emantrollslayer> I hate everyone equally
<emantrollslayer> dat Roxsnow

<Vordox> I heard it somewhere before
*emangamer hides behing Wrek
<Roxsnow> Thank you LadyCanary : 3.
<CriticKitten> And every other male in the universe. Really it's safer to assume Steven Blum is the VA until evidence proves otherwise. >_>
<twilight_squirtle> rofl i love how the shortest song in the eva 3.0 ost is "peaceful timess", only 50 secs
<Roxsnow> Ah yes... peaceful times -w-...
<Roxsnow> and the happiest : 3
<Bronysith> twilight_squirtle: did you already see rebuild 3.0?
<CriticKitten> >peaceful times
<CriticKitten> >Eva movie
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: gainax humor
<LadyCanary> HAHAHAAHAHA
<twilight_squirtle> CriticKitten: hence why its the shortest song
<CriticKitten> Movie is clearly trolling its viewers
<Roxsnow> the ost for 3.0 is out I believe
<twilight_squirtle> Bronysith: no ive not unfortunately
<LT_SKINNY> Like most anime movies haha
<Roxsnow> there iws only a partial camrip
<Bronysith> twilight_squirtle: damn, i need torrents or some shit for that film, it is going to be good
<Buytoast> what film
<LT_SKINNY> I cant remember a dragonball movie where I was actually invested

<Roxsnow> Yes Buytoast
<Bronysith> Buytoast: and giant alien monster mechs
<twilight_squirtle> Bronysith: well judging by most of the ost, rule number 1 will stil be in effect, most of the music is giving off a "we're all about to die" vibe, altho one seems more or less upbeat, like a final stand
<Soulless_DCLXVI> We can vote on the movie night? Where?
<LadyCanary> Soulless_DCLXVI: Subscribe to the newsletter ^_^
<Bronysith> twilight_squirtle: of course theres rule 1, it IS evangelion of course

<Vordox> Twas so? Whyzo?
<Vordox> Oh, Canadian Brony will make your sprite? =3
<CriticKitten> Oh, so I showed that Code Lyoko trailer to my friends. They were all crying. Safe to say I made their days tangibly worse. I hereby declare today a succeesful day.

<Prince_Lightstar> Wrek: u r a true american man
<CCharmanderK> Anybody know when the film lotto will open? It's getting seriously late.
<FlutterMEDIC> Bronysith: pretty much, along with the ability to shove an axe halfway through a guy's FACE
<Poom> Prince_Lightstar, he isn't from America.
<Bronysith> seriously, ever since evangelion and final fantasy 10, it seems every game or anime company wants their characters to be whiny bitches
<Bronysith> FlutterMEDIC: wow
<Prince_Lightstar> Poom: I SAY IF HE FROM WHERE I WANT TO
<AJIsAwesome> CCharmanderK: BS lotto? Not until about Thusday, I think.

<AJIsAwesome> Deploying smooth jazz in 3, 2, 1........
<FlutterMEDIC> Bronysith: but what the game really shines in is definitely the naval combat. i mean, THE NAVAL COMBAT IS AWESOME
<Prince_Lightstar> AJIsAwesome: this is not smooth jazz
<AJIsAwesome> Prince_Lightstar: It's a reference. :D
<Bronysith> FlutterMEDIC: sounds fun, i just dont have the money to spend on that, saving for conventions
<Prince_Lightstar> AJIsAwesome: u need more money
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<Prince_Lightstar> AJIsAwesome: MONEY
<Poom> Prince_Lightstar, so does africa.
<AJIsAwesome> "We've GOT to have.....money."
<Prince_Lightstar> Poom: look out guis we have a smart alic

<pony42532> some guy accused me of hacking after he ran through a mountain and then started runing in place
<Forever_Alone> FOREVER HATED IM GONE
<Mike> I'd pay attention to the stream, but I don't like metal.
<Ryunosuke> uhhh
<AJIsAwesome> Welp, that happened.
<otakon> pony42532: sounds like lag
<LadyCanary> Ah, attention whores.
<otakon> and overreact
<LadyCanary> Gotta love em.

<CCharmanderK> :)
<Mike> I wonder if Wrek has the 26 minute live version of Dazed and Confused.
<otakon> maybe
<CCharmanderK> Graphics in this game are lovely.
<otakon> who knows
<Mike> I would internet hug the shit out of him.
<Roxsnow> It's fine thelonepony : 3
<thelonepony> yay :3
<Roxsnow> you can nom noms : 3
<otakon> CCharmanderK: yeah too bad you need an Obsidian Tower built by the Dwarves of Moria to run it
<CCharmanderK> otakon: Lol, I believe it.
<otakon> just like Crysis way back in the day
<otakon> also awesome mech suit
<otakon> I want one
<CCharmanderK> Makes me wonder exactly how much money Wrek has and where it all comes from.
<Mike> CCharmanderK: Drugs.
<gdlk_ouo> Who else start playing for Conglomerate because they have awesome music?
<otakon> CCharmanderK: he's a graphic artist, he does model work
<CCharmanderK> Mike: Nah, Wrek ain't gangsta enough for drugs.
<LadyCanary> If he ever did drugs I would go over to Sweden and slap him.
<AJIsAwesome> XD
<CCharmanderK> otakon: Now THAT makes much more sense for Wrek.
<otakon> CCharmanderK: he's got a channel where you can see some of his work
<CCharmanderK> otakon: I'll scope it later.
<otakon> CCharmanderK: also, he did modeling for the guns in the newer Syndicate release
<Mike> Otakon, CCharmanderK: He doesn't make THOSE kinds of drugs, he makes drugs for the eyes, with his graphics.
<otakon> lol
<otakon> Now that's what I call Eyecandy
<otakon> :P
<Mike> REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG
<LadyCanary> Hm.
<CCharmanderK> I downloaded the dub of Kiki's Delivery Service a little while ago. :)
<Mike> YOU SHONE LIKE THE SUN
<LadyCanary> The Wall for A/B movie?
<CCharmanderK> Hayao Miyazaki = Storytelling genius.
<otakon> CCharmanderK: Phil Hartman's last role
<otakon> ;-;
<Mike> We should totally watch The Wall and Song Remains The Same for movie night.
<CCharmanderK> Hell, Hayao Miyazaki = Genius, period.
<gdlk_ouo> I was never young. I was hatched from mothergrub as all we here.
<otakon> it's gonna be a sad day when he passes
<AJIsAwesome> Can I ask for your critique on something, guys? :)
<CCharmanderK> FUN FACT: For Phil Hatman's last two roles (Kiki's Delivery Service and Small Soldiers), he played opposite Kirsten Stewart in the lead role in both.
<Wrek> 05fun fact: streamign thsi game to you cuts 30 fps
<otakon> neat fact
<AJIsAwesome> CCharmanderK: The more you know~
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: shoot
<LadyCanary> NO WAI
<Mike> I'm sorry for being uneducated-Who's Hayao Miyazaki?
<CCharmanderK> Mike: WHAT?!
<LadyCanary> Hey hey, it's okay if he doesnt know.
<CCharmanderK> Mike: Tell me you did NOT just say that.
<Wrek> 05i dont know that either
<otakon> Mike: THE DISNEY OF JAPAN!
<Wrek> 05so hush
<otakon> Wrek: O_o
<Mike> I may know of his work, just not him.
<CCharmanderK> Wrek: Oh my God...
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: ask away
<thelonepony> :2
<thelonepony> :3*
<LadyCanary> Guys, not everyone is gonna know who he is.
<otakon> WE MUST REMEDY THIS
<CCharmanderK> He made films such as Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro.
<LadyCanary> Chill. It's not the end of the world.
<otakon> Castle in the Sky
<CCharmanderK> YES, CASTLE IN THE SKY!!
<otakon> LadyCanary: -_- say out of this one please
<CCharmanderK> That's my favorite film of his.
<otakon> CCharmanderK: PATSU! BADDEST OF THE BADASSES!
<LT_SKINNY> Back :)
<LadyCanary> ...What did I do otakon
<Mike> THAT GUY?!?! I always forget his name. He makes my favorite anime movies like Howl's Moving Castle.
<AJIsAwesome> Criticism is welcome, so feel free to address anything that's doesn't fit. :)
<AJIsAwesome> http://i.imgur.com/79rkE.png
<otakon> LadyCanary: chill, not the end of the world. please let me have this one eh?
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, LT_SKINNY. :)
<CCharmanderK> otakon: Pazu is the closest you will EVER get to a typical Shounen hero in a Miyazaki film.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: looks like the average BG pony
<LadyCanary> Ooooookay.... o3o
<Wrek> 05CCharmanderK: oh that guy
<Wrek> 05silly you expectign me to knwo him by name
<otakon> CCharmanderK: and the strong man contest in the town, one of the funniest scenes ever
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Alright. Any advice you'd like to suggest? :)
<CCharmanderK> Wrek: Yes. That guy.
<LT_SKINNY> Thanks AJIsAwesome :) And is that your OC I spy?
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: looks okay :3
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: well some clothes maybe, something you yourself would wear
<Mike> Wrek: Like I said, most know his work, but not him.
<AJIsAwesome> LT_SKINNY: Beta at the moment. Subject to change. :)
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Okay. Anything else?
<otakon> Mike: well still, go look up some of his stuff. I recommend Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
<CCharmanderK> otakon: The best scene, though, is when Sheeta falls from the sky and her levitation crystal activates. The music in the English dub (which was redone for orchestra) just made it simply magical.
<Wrek> 05onyl seen spirited away of those movies
<Mike> Otakon: I've already seen Howl's Castle, Spirited Away, and like three others.
<LT_SKINNY> AJIsAwesome: If its only beta, then youve got a good framework going. Whats your OC's talent going to be?
<otakon> aye aye
<Wrek> 05but thats cause my sis is a huge anime chick
<CCharmanderK> Wrek: You should see Miyazaki's other work.
<otakon> Mike: nice, Spirited Away is my personal favorite
<otakon> Porco Rosso is good too
<Wrek> 05meh
<AJIsAwesome> LT_SKINNY: Still in development. Any changes you'd consider? :)
<Roxsnow> castle in the sky : 3......
<otakon> Grave of the Fireflies is the ONLY Ghibli movie I don't like
<Mike> Otakon: Howl's Moving Castle for me.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Princess Mononoke was good :)
<CCharmanderK> Porco Rosso is really good, but not his best.
<otakon> if only bc it's so goddamn depressing
<Roxsnow> I remember the meme we had here... pazu is a badass :3
<otakon> CCharmanderK: it had the staple "energetic granny" in it as well
<gdlk_ouo> ok guys, who else here older than 25?
<otakon> Man can we do Miyazaki week again?
<otakon> gdlk_ouo: me
<CCharmanderK> I love Grave of the Fireflies... but I'm not gonna watch it again for a LONG time.
<Mike> Personally, I'm fourteen.
<otakon> CCharmanderK: I had it on VHS.. oh God the tears
<CCharmanderK> I HAVE it on VHS.
<CCharmanderK> No shit, I bought the dubbed widescreen VHS and watched that.
<CCharmanderK> Was so sad I could not physically cry.
<LT_SKINNY> AJIsAwesome: Hmm... I cant really see anything too blaring. That baby blue mane is a nice compliment to the shade of yellow you chose for your coat :)
<CCharmanderK> Not giving up that tape for a million bucks, though.
<Mike> CCharmanderK: Like Pokemon: Mewtwo Strikes Back?
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: nice color scheme, but he's just a bit too plain is all
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Ah, I understand. Any changes/recommendation you'd consider?
<CCharmanderK> Mike: What does Pokemon have to do with Grave of the Fireflies?
<Dark92Enigma-> AJIsAwesome: is that you in OC? just like i imagined :)
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: clothing of some kind, even if' it's only a hat
<LT_SKINNY> otakon: Yeah, thats pretty much the only thing I can say. Needs moar... moar
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma-: Beta, still in development.
<Mike> CCharmanderK: It was so sad I couldn't cry.
<otakon> Mike: ;_;
<gdlk_ouo> otakon, oh good, i thought i'm the oldest here :)
<otakon> never watching it again
<otakon> gdlk_ouo: not by a long shot, we got the venerable Kencolt here as well
<otakon> he's 50
<Wrek> 05i remember watchign this concert with me dad when i was but a kid
<Wrek> 05'twas nice
<gdlk_ouo> wow
<otakon> gdlk_ouo: he's an okay guy though, very knowledgable
<spypengen> I'm back

<AJIsAwesome> LT_SKINNY: We do? :D
<spypengen> my internet is taking a dump right now
<Mike> Wrek: Agreed. Alot of people my age and younger are little shits. Sometimes I can't even believe I'm their age.

<otakon> spypengen: Scootaflew's
<Scootaflew> Well I did sort of mimic another picture
<LadyCanary> I actually expected Wrek to be this big, tough fellow.
<spypengen> I feel like I missed something
<AJIsAwesome> *Late 20s
<Wrek> 05yes im a solid 38, wear top had and other various antiques aswell as conversing in a posh brittish terminology :P
<spypengen> I havent seen said picture
<LadyCanary> OH GOD.

<LT_SKINNY> AJIsAwesome: Sure, just look at me. Nearly 20 yrs old and I hate the attitudes of both my younger sister's friends :D
<gdlk_ouo> Wrek, indeed, age doesn't matter actually if person are adequate. But most of kids really annoying.
<Scootaflew> http://imgur.com/tTnxK
<Mike> Wrek: I need more tea and crumpets.
<Dark92Enigma-> i agree with AJIsAwesome. i thought you were 24
<Scootaflew> Theres the pic
<AJIsAwesome> LadyCanary: Yeah, I expected him to be much older judging by his dA profile picture.
<spypengen> that's much better than I can draw with a pencil
<LadyCanary> I used to be scared of Wrek, actually
<LadyCanary> XD
<AJIsAwesome> Even though it is a pony version of him. :D

<Mike> Scootaflew: A bit of advice, don't freehand, use background drawing and mltiple lines.
<Dark92Enigma-> LadyCanary: you were scared of him because......?
<otakon> yeah good question
<LadyCanary> Because he was tough. And bumtazed those who were not behaving.
