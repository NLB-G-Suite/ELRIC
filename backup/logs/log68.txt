<RanYakumo> Hold me tight!
<Aponymous> Is this gonna be really disjointed?

<RainbowDoubleDash> everyone wears white in this universe?

*ReticentSmolder MOAR MOVIE TRIVIA: Although in the scene outside the high school everyone was dressed in jackets, coats, hats etc... It was actually near 80 degrees while filming. In fact, when the camera cut, they brought umbrellas over the principal actors to keep them in the shade.

*Sol challenges any Beatlesfriends to find ALL the Beatles refferences in this film
<SkyrimOrBust> This film is a stylish pornographic musical disguised as a regular musical. It's actually quite good.

<NewManiac> Sol, challenge accepted
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties: Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a british accent: but those accents don't sound natural at all.
<Dastardo> my beatles posters approve of this movie
<Denied_Existence> Teakettle is loud
<DragonRage> DragonRage has listened to Electrical Beast. He doesn't judge the authenticity of British accents anymore.
<sotha> She just loves the Beatles, and has 142 or so of their songs.
<techdude300> DING
<DeadlyPony> OOOOOO DAT ACCENT IS A BEAUTY THERE!
<Amorphic> There are like 200 different british accents
<Klonoa79H> whats this movie
<ReticentSmolder> @SilverScreen its because that's a Scottish limey accent
<AlCapony> Best shits? what?
<RainbowFox> Fluttershy is yaying
<Hipster_Brony> 8we are hemorrhaging viewers for this movie
<RanYakumo> Let's not even get into the Irish accents.
<ReticentSmolder> DING
<Silverscreen> 11reticentSmolder: ah, thank you.
<RobotPinkie> Rogert Ebert said this movie was great. I trust Roger Ebert. End of story.
<Dastardo> i have all the albums and singles but never seen this movie :/
<Ghosties> 4I can't tell the difference between a fake one and a real one. I've only ever spoken to two Brits, and that's RBD and Dman
<The_Si> Feck. Potato.
<Ghosties> 4RBD moreso
<WF_Chronicles> lol
<RainbowDoubleDash> the best accent is the boring monotone accent
<Sol> He's shooting for a Liverpool dialect. Does it work? ..... eh
<Bashfluff> British accents are super sexy. Except this one.
<DeadlyPony> DAT BE A IRISH BOY WITH A PHOTOSHOP BOYO!
<ReticentSmolder> @Ghosties he really does have an accent
<Ghosties> No wonder
<WF_Chronicles> I mostly trust Ebert

<AlCapony> I trust Armin White the most.
<techdude300> Slap him and have ANGRY SEX
<Dastardo> where's doctor who?
<Keiw> slap the taste out
<sotha> The movie actually is pretty good. It's just that a character or two and some of the scenes are just kind of put in there only as excuses to get more songs in.
<Dman> Yay Ghosties! Us brits ain't that bad!
*ReticentSmolder K guys, he is going to the US to find his long last dad-o

<Keiw> my god this would never work in RL
<Ghosties> 4Tell me when they're done singing, guys
<Amorphic> Can someone explain why there are so many beatles songs in this movie?
<Sol> This is not a musical
<AlCapony> Ay be back baefaore yew knewww eett
<RainBroDash> 10I will tell you how true the accents are in a minute, after the singing
<Dastardo> good song
<WF_Chronicles> king of the world, etc
<mib_wozsp1> hi
<Dee_Twenty> Frankly I don't blame him for wanting a break from assface there.
<Sol> IT IS AN OPERA
<Excalibur> Im on a boat!
<WhatPayne> hey a song i recognize.
<NewManiac> Zark937, this WHOLE MOVIE is Beatles music.
<DeadlyPony> WEEEE OOOOOOOOOOHHHH WRIT HOME OOOO!
<Sol> HAHAHAHAHAHA
<RanYakumo> This is like a giant tribute to the Beatles.
<mib_wozsp1> musical
<RainbowDoubleDash> Write home from a boat... yea
<Zark937> nice
<sotha> Amorphic it's a musical featuring only beatles music
<RobotPinkie> WF_Chronicles, I think that's mostly a misunderstanding. What he means by art is not the same as most people. Of course, he also doesn't think most movies live up to being "art"
<ReticentSmolder> RainBroDash, you missed the intro and HelterSkelter, oh and some 60's high school shit
<Forbearance> What you think is British is English.
<Silverscreen> 11RainBroDash: mmkay. ^.^
<Forbearance> ENGLISH!
<DeadlyPony> ENGRISH BEATLES!
<mib_sb2kdd> CMON BREAK OUT IN SONG AND DANCE ALREADY.
<Darken_Skye> is this guy being ever so slightly autotuned?

<Steel_Thunder> just so you know
<DeadlyPony> *Clops hooves in time with musc*
<Dastardo> sorry rainbro
<VintageVCR> Why do I keep getting knocked out of the video?
<RanYakumo> Darken_Skye I think he's actually singing.
<mib_wozsp1> they need to get a better computer/laptop
<Purple`Prose> Helter Skelter will pop up later
<ReticentSmolder> @Darken_Skye no, he actually has a very nice voice
<Axel_Foaley> Northern London accents sound extremely fake.
<RainbowDoubleDash> there was no autotune back in my day /oldfag look
<AlCapony> 8 |
<Steel_Thunder> the soldier that goes to war thinking about some love he had always dies
<Denied_Existence> Is this rugby?

<Keiw> *sigh* reminds me of high school =p
<Amorphic> Hold my hand
<mib_r5mjsn> I never understood this girl's character :(
<sotha> Why not just enjoy the music without comparing it to the Beatles?

<WF_Chronicles> I think
*ReticentSmolder MOAR MOVIE *TRIVIA* This film was released in the United States on John Lennon's birthday (October 9th).
<[Ger]Brony1> If this movie is called 'Across the universe' i somehow feel ripped-off.
<SirSprinkles> 6It was a ban that literally meant nothing, RBD
<Ghosties> 4Guys, my video crashed
<Hipster_Brony> 8Denied_Existence: 2007 IIRC
<Axel_Foaley> I never saw the movie version.
<mib_wozsp1> TAXI!
<mib_sb2kdd> This dude looks legit
<SirSprinkles> 6And was set ages ago.
<Aponymous> IS there a point to the singing or is it just "lolBeatles"
<RainBroDash> that ban was hilarious sprinkles
<mib_sb2kdd> Pick him up
<WF_Chronicles> It is, Brony1
<AlCapony> Ghosties: Maybe it's saying something.
<DeadlyPony> OOOO EY LADDY MEH WILL PICK YA UP WITH A LOE!
<femalebrony> 0That woman is out of the kitchen.
<Denied_Existence> Ok...thats fine then
<LuridChronomancer> I was expecting space.

*ReticentSmolder RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA IF YOU STILL CARE: Sadie, with her fiery red hair and passionate temper, is a reference to Janis Joplin.

<RainBroDash> because the mods led the viewers into a collaborative hate on his favourite genre
<Ghosties> I won't deny that the mods have some amount of influence to the regular viewers, but if you think I'm going to just keep quiet because some people get upset that I can't tolerate this film, then that's completely unfair.
<Silverscreen> 11So, I'm guessing that there were two funerals. One was for the girlfriend's father who was killed in war. The other was a young black boy who was killed during the Civil Rights Riots that took place back then.

*ReticentSmolder MOVIE BACKGROUND: Prudence is an archetype for beaten women and the way society glossed over their existence for awhile. She is a lesbian and her last relationship with a man ended rather badly.
<Dee_Twenty> This movie would probably be better if he WAS surrounded by promiscuous dope fiends.
<Ghosties> I will not change who I am just because it upsets a few people
<Ghosties> However
<RainBroDash> I just want you to realise that you've ostracised a crowd by doing so
<Excalibur> yes why don't we do it in the room?
<durger> i can'ts stand this noise!
<Ghosties> I will publicly apologize to ReticentSmolder
<Denied_Existence> SHE ALREADY IS!
<Excalibur> sounds reasoable
<rapidash> Thanks for the facts, reticentsmolder!
<NewManiac> Dee_Twenty, it is.

<mib_r5mjsn> Thanks for clearing that up. I never understood Prudence's character, til now XD
<ReticentSmolder> @mib_jolsjb yes, she tried a straight relationship to appear straight, being a lesbian wasn't exactly socially acceptable

<Spiderzumbie> EMOTIONS, HOW DO THEY WORK?
<SirSprinkles> 6We really just shouldn't be criticizing any of the movies put forward...
<WF_Chronicles> Director: Pinkie Pie

<RanYakumo> IF I FELL
<DeadlyPony> LUMPY FOOOOOL
<Drrk> how is this a beatles song?
<VintageVCR> The Rutles> This Movie
<WF_Chronicles> Musical Director: Octavia
<RobotPinkie> I thought this movie sounded like an ironic choice at first, but this is frickin' GOOD.
<SirSprinkles> 6That we don't talk about.
<rapidash> mib_r5mjsn lol wuT
<Drrk> fuck this premise
<Excalibur> needs more yellow submarine
<SirSprinkles> 6Ever.
<Aurora> 6you wont be
<Ghosties> But I understand that I was really vocal, and I apologize if I made you feel bad about it
<Silverscreen> 11Fuzzy: No vid links.

<RobotPinkie> Keeps me from posting stupid shit in chat. :(
<Glacymr> 12but it is considered advertising isn't it?
<AlCapony> Night mah bronies.
<Denied_Existence> @Excalibur That might work
<Purple`Prose> Pinkie Pie did direct this. And mid-script, she went Pinkamina
<SirSprinkles> 6fuzz, no video links
<Aurora> 6not really
<Glacymr> 12if i post a link to another site
<fuzz> aww
<Excalibur> fuck the plot i have singing
<Lukem1999> LOL
<Aurora> 6everyone posts links o.o
<Aponymous> It's not BAD, I don't care for most musicals though...
<Sol> Nice remixes, bad movie
<RainbowDoubleDash> It's the hormones...
<Nyx> Plot? What plot?
<NewManiac> No yellow submarine in this movie.
<Denied_Existence> FUCK DA PLOT
<RainBroDash> it just feels a bit shitty to watch the probable viewer count drop day by day when you're looking forward to watching a film for the first time with so many people, just to see that they're not even gonna give it the time of day
<Glacymr> 12heh
<Ghosties> And Sprinkles, it's not fair to completely ostracize one film without remorse and not be allowed to hate another with consequences
<Glacymr> 12anyway Aurora did you find the post?
<Silverscreen> 11....
<mib_jolsjb> This is boring
<Silverscreen> 11this song sucks.
<Octavia> Fuck da plot while singing you say?
<WF_Chronicles> I dunno
<DeadlyPony> Pride like HER
<Nyx> I watch it for da plot
<{Skyedevil}> FAIL.
<SushiRoll> I watch it....for the singing.
<Enterprize> you mean the music isn't the plot?
<Spiderzumbie> SO, yeah, conversations are happening. yeah.
<Aponymous> Beatles songs help somewhat.
<Sol> There was a Yellow Submarine
<techdude300> Did you just sing a bunch of songs? That's detrimental to the plot!
<Monkey_Zombie> 0Needed Maxwell's silver hammer
<Enterprize> shit...
<The_Si> Lacks the Letter B.
*ReticentSmolder If you guys can't relate this to the plot you have been reading too much chat :P
<RainbowDoubleDash> there is no plot to speak of
<RainBroDash> i really do think spiders web is an exception
<techdude300> Screw the plot we have beatles!
<WF_Chronicles> First time I saw this, I was skeptical too
<Silverscreen> 11Seriously. This song just plain sucks.
<WF_Chronicles> but I saw it
<Excalibur> i wanna watch yellow submarine
<VintageVCR> Let's just watch Yellow Submarine another day
<WF_Chronicles> and liked it.

<Spiderzumbie> JUST FUCK HER ALREADY SHE WANTS IT BAD YOU CAN TELL BY THE AWFUL SINGING
<Purple`Prose> It's silly
<Ghosties> It's not fair, though
<ReticentSmolder> @Silverscreen yeah it kind of does, but they needed a sappy love song
<Sol> It was WAY at the beginning and was one of the THOUSANDS of references in this movie
<DeadlyPony> FUCKTHT SERGAN PEPPA!
<Octavia> Disregard plot. Start singing.
<Silverscreen> 11STOP FUCKING SINGING!

<Drrk> was that how sex is portrayed in this movie?
<Aponymous> When do they get high again?
<ThePretender> OH SNAP
<Drrk> what a let down
<Dee_Twenty> So you take a movie where the entire schtick is being filled with Beatles music... and you don't actually use any of the Beatles' recordings. Does not compute.
<RanYakumo> That's gotta be a rude awakening for Max.
<Purple`Prose> Ooops
<Silverscreen> 11SHUT....UP!
<Aurora> 6hmm
<RainbowDoubleDash> threesome
<Octavia> Yay naked people!
<Nyx> SEX = SINGING

<Denied_Existence> CONCENTRATION CAMP TIME FOR SOME REASON
<Glacymr> 12i deleted that topic
<Ghosties> But then the soldier's dancing COMPLETELY ruined it
<rapidash> on the DVD they have a pro-draft scene in the extras. it really makes the military look kind and caring.
<Sol> More hyperbole than symbolism
<Glacymr> 12how did it come back
<Spiderzumbie> COREOGRAPHY BASIC TRAINING
<Glacymr> 12lol
<thunderhooves> 0i guess thats why they say dont ask dont tell
<mib_jolsjb> Can't dance.. Time to drink my own piss!
<LordEchimaru> tax dollars down the drain
<Dee_Twenty> Hipster_Brony: Silly filly, this is how the army really works, haven't you ever seen Stripes?
<durger> don't ask don't tell
<Nyx> >:|
<CircuitMane> Hipster_brony - this is how they fight, nothing makes the enemy give up than dance choriography

*ReticentSmolder They turned "She's So Heavy" into a social commentary regarding the high cost Vietnam came with. 'She', literally refers to Lady Liberty in this case.

<mib_dinto3> merci beaucoup
<Trixie> .... Why are her eyes colliderscopes?
<techdude300> Well that was unexpectedly poor
<thunderhooves> 0ITS THE POOL NUDE SCENE
<SirSprinkles> 6ALL YOU NEED IS DRUGS
<Amorphic> THIS IS THE WORST SONG IN THE MOVIE
<RainbowFox> Moral of the story: Don't worry about being faithful to your girlfriend. There are hotter chicks in America.
<The_Si> It had its moments.
<SirSprinkles> 6ALL YOU NEED IS DRUGS
<Sathi> 7Thanks for the subtitles
<ThePretender> ReticentSmolder, thanks for the details
<Denied_Existence> @Sol Ja Klar!
<iHeldAChicken> interesting....
<LordEchimaru> The bass in Last Train to London is amazing
<SirSprinkles> 6ALL YOU NEED IS DRUGS
<SirSprinkles> 6DRUGS ARE ALL YOU NEED
<Ghosties> Okay guys
<Ghosties> 4Oh shit, no mod colors
<Ghosties> 4Anyways
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Silverscreen> 11That was...interesting.
<Ghosties> 4I just wanna say something to the room so we can understand a few things
<Silverscreen> 11Just...interesting.
<Ghosties> 4First of all, I'm gonna apologize to ReticentSmolder.
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Ghosties> 4He picked the film, and I don't want him to think that I am chastising or ostracizing him for the film that he picked. I have absolutely no beef or qualm with him at all.
<drf|laptop> 03"Thanks a lot for helping me look for Carla" "No problem I'll check the dumpster"
<Ghosties> 4That said
<Flutterpeanut> 13You leik chocolate milk?
<Light_Latias> 12night all~
<Ghosties> 4I've been told that a few people on here were voicing their concerns about me to other mods, and I would be very appreciative if you would say it to me in a PM.
<HyperMetalLugia> Nii
<HyperMetalLugia> :)
<Ghosties> 4Furthermore, it's my right to voice my opinion on a film
<Ghosties> 4As it is yours
<Silverscreen> 11anyone else in the mood for tacos now?
<Silverscreen> 11just as I was alright with people giving their opinion about my Random Movie Trivia :P
<Ghosties> 4I may have upset a few people, but they should understand that in now way should my opinion sway that of others. I may be a mod, but I'm also a regular person too
<drf|laptop> 03"you might find out the very same thing you hate is the thing you'll end up missing when it's gone"
<drf|laptop> 03Nah, I won't hate apple if they go out of business
<Ghosties> 4After all, I didn't kick anybody that was bitching and moaning during Evil Dead II and plenty of people were complaining about it the whole time
<Hipster_Brony> 8see ya tomorrow sathi
<Ghosties> 4So, EVERYBODY has the right to complain.
<Hipster_Brony> 8 /today
<Ghosties> 4And yes
<SirSprinkles> 6Long story short, if you have a problem, with ANY of us, we'd appreciate it if you RESPECTFULLY said it to our (cyber) faces instead of going behind our backs about it. We'll only find out about it later.
<Ghosties> 4I hated this film
<Silverscreen> 11This movie was....really fucking weird.
<Ghosties> 4So, again, I'm sorry to ReticentSmolder. I have no problem with you
<Ghosties> 4I just fucking HATE musicals
<Silverscreen> 11That's the only conclusion I have for it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hear that everypony? If you get picked in the lotto, pick a musical.
<Ghosties> 4And no, no amount of tolerance will change that
<Silverscreen> 11I mean, half the songs were good, half of them were shit. The story's hard to follow if you don't know US history that well.
<Sathi> 7Im just glad we had someone giving background information..
<Ghosties> 4It was my OPINION
<Ghosties> 4Got it?
<Silverscreen> 11and the style was ALL over the place.
<Silverscreen> 11just...just fucking weird.
<Silverscreen> 11Not good. Not bad. Just weird.
<Ghosties> 4Like I said, I didn't kick any of you guys when you bitched about my movie choice a few months ago
*RainBroDash 10liked it
<Ghosties> 4So yeah, if you have a problem with me. Say it to my, as Sprinkles said, Cyber face
<Ghosties> 4Thank you
<Ghosties> 4And I hope you enjoyed the film
<Ascendant> SHINY
<RainBroDash> can we move on in the chat now? i think the point has been clearly made
<Ascendant> and heya Lugianite
<Ghosties> 4And Bruce Campbell
<Silverscreen> 11That said, thanks for coming by for this week's BMN. We look forward to seeing you next week when we watch Inception and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02hey
<Ghosties> 4Cause he's awesome
<SirSprinkles> 6That said, we welcome any and all kinds of movies, as changes of pace are good. Just as long as they're... movies and not SW:APT
<Hipster_Brony> 8LOUD
<mib_jolsjb> LUNA IS BEST PONY!
<Ghosties> 4That's right, we welcome all kinds of movies
<Pinkamina> I agree that the film was weird. And why would people bitch about Evil Dead II? lol. I love that series. Army of Darkness is probably my favorite we'rve watched together.
<Dee_Twenty> Silverscreen: Actually, yes, I'd kill for some tacos, with sour cream and chipotle sauce. I think this movie was funded by Taco Hell and they slipped in a metric fuck ton of subliminal advertising.
<mib_jolsjb> LUNA IS BEST PONY!
<Ziltoid> inb4after ghosties hates this movie
<RanYakumo> I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who doesn't like at least 75% of all the Beatle's songs.
<mib_dinto3> LOUD
<Srake> And furthermore It hurt my feelings.
<Sol> Ghosties, you cool.
<WF_Chronicles> Last Train to Transcentral > Last Train to London
<Riders> Don't feel bad Ghosties. As a person who has a great appreciation for musicals, I hated this film as well
<Supaspeedstrut> i used to hate musicals too...
<ReticentSmolder> @Ghosties, I realize that musicals aren't everyone's cup of tea, and I really appreciate your honesty. It takes real strength to apologize like that, thank you man, <3 you. I totally get where you're coming from and I respect your opinion.
<Trixie> SOCKS
*ClockworkPie pats Ghosties on the shoulder
<mib_r5mjsn> I think you need to be a Beatles fan to truly appreciate this movie, but that's just *my* opinion ;)
<RobotPinkie> lol I like your random movie trivia, Silverscreen
<RainbowDoubleDash> Don't worry... Ponies fix everything
<Trixie> NYX IS BEST PONY
<interior_gummy> i'd like to start with a request for the postshow
<thunderhooves> DAT VLC MeDIA PLAYER
<Purple`Prose> Can't read my, can't read my, no you can't read my cyber face. o/`
<iHeldAChicken> Is it because you can't sing Ghosties? Is that why you don't like musicals?
<mib_jolsjb> LUNA IS BEST PONY!
<GamerGodJones> T TT T T TURBOCHAT
<Denied_Existence> @ReticentSmolder That movie was...interesting...but it did give me a perspective on that time period. So I rate it 3/5!
<mib_d8n51z> no gokaiger?
<TGPFluttershy> I loved the trivia
<SpaceBrony> i usually don't like remixes / 8bit music
<Trixie> http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/205/c/a/pony_crawls_in_the_sock_by_bronyboy-d41io0q.png
<SpaceBrony> but this is SO EPIC
<Aponymous> I want tacos.
<Bashfluff> The movie was of a really now quality. When they sang Hey Jude, I melted, but otherwise...the songs were REALLY mediocre. The plot was all over the place, the characters were flat, and the movie looked for all the world like you did drugs before you turned it on. The plot was just there to justify using Beatles music.
<Chiyo> DAT CONE
<thunderhooves> WINTER WRAPUP 1

<Denied_Existence> Cause I could stay up ALL NIGHT
<RainbowFox> *5th place
<SilverMane> ReticentSmolder, how is mulan a b movie?
<Bane> I...
<Denied_Existence> For some reason
<Bane> am so. high right now
<Bashfluff> I think those theories are the best part.
<sotha> Applebloom!
<thunderhooves> ASIANS
<Silverscreen> 11ReticentSmolder: You wouldn't have been allowed.
<WF_Chronicles> Also, like, Leonardo Decaprio has finished redeeming himself for Titantic.
<Bane> oh mmyy gggoooddd
<ReticentSmolder> @SilverMane its slightly older? i dunno
<RainbowDoubleDash> Inception is one of the rare good movies
<Silverscreen> 11We already watched Mulan on here.
<RandomExtra> Mulan was already shown
<interior_gummy> hey, how long until requests?
<Ascendant> crap
<thunderhooves> dern
<Aponymous> I loved Inception, all the people yapping about the ending never heard of "Ambiguity" before.
*iHeldAChicken appreciates ReticentSmolder 's choice
<thunderhooves> mulan is cool
<ReticentSmolder> @Silverscreen, well good thing huh? lol
<sotha> the ending was the best part.
<mib_jolsjb> Mulan is pretty decent
<Dman> Make a man outta you
<books> Meh, I never liked Mualn.
<Srake> Browser crashed...
<Denied_Existence> THEM DAMN HUNS
<books> :/
<Trixie> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/thumb/131162806926s.png NYX >:}
<Bashfluff> I think it was purposefully ambiguous FOR the theories.
<Gecomol> Why did the Asian got shot first in Inception?
<RobotPinkie> No ambiguity about the Inception ending, unless you didn't actually watch the movie.
<SilverSonic> Drake, just get alien swarm :P
<Flutterpeanut> 13I'm still waiting for someone to pick Cast Away.
<thunderhooves> DERN HUNS
<iHeldAChicken> lull
<Flutterpeanut> 13D:
<SilverSonic> its free i think
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You're Uralooser right?
<WF_Chronicles> just don't ruin the end of the movie please.
<RainbowDoubleDash> Inception today is what the matrix was 10 years ago
<Srake> FUCK Google Chrome
<Bashfluff> It just supposed to be thought-provoking.
<Ghosties> Were you guys okay with what I said in the main room?
<sotha> Cast Away!
<Dee_Twenty> I'll give Inception a fair shot, but comparing it to the Matrix is not a good way to eliminate my apprehensions.
<Ascendant> the hinge of my laptop's screen just snapped
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Aristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Ascendant> shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
<Ghosties> Do you think it was good?
<iHeldAChicken> O_O
<Silverscreen> 11The only problem I have with the ending of inception is...DID THE ASIAN FUCKER GET OUT OR NOT?! (being ambiguous sos to not give spoilers.)
<thunderhooves> SPALDING NOOOOOOOO
<Dashite_Alt> As you wish flutterpeanut!
<GamerGodJones> I LOVE CAST AWAY
<Chiyo> I think you should do repeats of the best movies after a while for the new bronies.
<ReticentSmolder> @FlutterPeanut WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILSON?!
<Starwish> Is matrix ten years old?
<Trixie> Oh I love Cast Away
<SilverSonic> o-o
<sotha> We'd better not ruin the movie.
<Ghosties> Why the hell am I asking the room
<Flutterpeanut> 13WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
<SirSprinkles> 6I had no issue with it.

<Trixie> YES
<RobotPinkie> lol
<mib_r5mjsn> I just saw Cast Away on TV
<Dark_Horst> i think that inception was better than matrix
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02What did you do NS?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02FOR SHAME
<Trixie> The Asian fucker got out
<WF_Chronicles> it's older than hat, starwish
<Aponymous> Inception is SO MUCH BETTER than the Matrix.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I thought I taught you better
<Dark_Horst> there. i said it
<Ghosties> I feel like a silly person now
<SirSprinkles> 6It was drawn out, but it was cool.
<Dman> silverscreen - he wakes in the plane with a really depressed / withdrawn face. so i'd say yes.
<interior_gummy> spoiler: it's a dream
<Trixie> With the guy who's name reminds me of pie
<Aponymous> Like, 100% cooler.
<Srake> We should watch Cast away
<Denied_Existence> BRING ON THE HUNS! I HAVE READ SUN TZU FROM FRONT TO BACK
<Dashite_Alt> Silverscreen, yes he did. O.o He's on the plane.
<SirSprinkles> 6*shrug* It's not a big deal.
<Dman> Spoiler: They Go Deeper
<Ghosties> Quite honestly, no one should care what someone thinks about the films
<GamerGodJones> PONY POLKA!!!!!!!!!!
<NewDCD> 9guy I am hurtbutt
<HaxBrony> i cant wait to see all the spam on inception.
<iHeldAChicken> I like this one
<GamerGodJones> damn
<WF_Chronicles> I think everyone who isn't stupid thinks that Inception is better than The Matrix
<Dman> newdcd still not working?
<SirSprinkles> 6I was upset to learn ponies were going behind your back though.
<ReticentSmolder> @Aponymous I agree...if you are taking the Matrix as a series, the first movie alone against inception is a pretty close race
<RainbowDoubleDash> PONEEE PONEE
<Ghosties> I guess I just wanted approval from my fellow co workers
<NewDCD> 9nope
<Silverscreen> 11Dman: I'd argue, but it'd be spoilerific for people in here....
<thunderhooves> AWSOME
<Dee_Twenty> That's not exactly a high bar you know, being better than the Matrix is about even with being better than a kick in the nuts.
<NewDCD> 9FUCKING XNA
<Dark_Horst> oh YEAH! castaway in this room would be awesome
<iHeldAChicken> :O
<WF_Chronicles> but that's me.
<SpaceBrony> hahaha
<RobotPinkie> Don't make me put the smackdown on you jive ass neighas, now.
<Dman> : /
<interior_gummy> now for friendship is not available
<thunderhooves> HERCULEESE

<Ghosties> Oh, I was too
<Trixie> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131159797526.png
<FreezeFrame> I really mostly want to see Inception after reading the Inception crossover fanfic >.>
<Trixie> SOCKS
<Ghosties> I was pretty pissed
<NewDCD> 9WHY MUST YOU HOLD ME AWAY FROM MY 16-BIT RPG SO
<thunderhooves> OH SHIT
<Trixie> SOOOOOOOOOOOOOCKS
<WF_Chronicles> BWOOOOOOOOOONG.
<Trixie> I'M IN SOCKS
<books> there's an incpetion crossover??
<Starwish> Wow this fits nicely
<thunderhooves> RAINBOWS MARRK LOOKS LIKE ZEUSES SEAL IN THAT MOVIE
<Trixie> (I AM PROUD OF YOU SON)
<Dman> Silverscreen so do ya mean if he rode the kick or stayed in there for godknowshowlong? is that what you mean?
<WF_Chronicles> ladies and gentlemen
<books> Link me up, brony.
<Drake> 04uh-oh
<Aponymous> ReticentSmolder: I completely ignore the sequels.
<WF_Chronicles> be prepared to use this button
<Ghosties> But now they know to come to me if they have a problem :)
<Dark_Horst> actually, i thought the fic was better than the movie B)
<Lugianite-afk> bbl
<WF_Chronicles> http://inception.davepedu.com/
<Ascendant> I can't exactly fix it ><
<SpaceBrony> this is pretty great
<Trixie> DAD, ARE YOU SOCKS?
<WF_Chronicles> BWOOOOOOONG.
<Denied_Existence> AAAAGGHHHH
<sotha> There's a MLP Inception crossover!
<Silverscreen> 11Who IS the little black mare?!
<NewDCD> 9YES SON
<RainbowDoubleDash> we need more art of ponies in pajamas
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying they actually will
<Trixie> (YES, NOW WE ARE A FAMILY AGAIN)
<mib_jolsjb> NYX
<NewDCD> 9NOW WE CAN BE CLOTHES ENSEMBLE AGAIN
<mib_jolsjb> NYX DAMN IT
<iHeldAChicken> Nix
<Ghosties> They should
<RainbowFox> yay
<Trixie> YES
<Ersatz> Nyx*
<iHeldAChicken> NYX SORRY
<FreezeFrame> books: Yeah, it's about Celestia's dream.
<Trixie> CLOTHES ENSEMBLE
<Trixie> I SEE
<interior_gummy> when will you take requests?
<Silverscreen> 11Nyx?
<Trixie> NYX!
<ReticentSmolder> @Aponymous <3 me too
<Dashite_Alt> Goddamn this song. :(
<sotha> I meant that as a question, by the way?
<Ersatz> The y makes it fancy
<Trixie> Nyx is best pony
<RobotPinkie> We need more art of ponies period.
<Dark_Horst> yes, nyx. read it
<Ersatz> It's a fanfic, "Past Sins"
<Chiyo> Thanks for making my Friday night more interesting bronies. See ya next time.
<books> I'll have to look that up later
<ThePretender> well, I'm out, later everyone and I'll be here next week
<Trixie> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131159801680.jpg
<Silverscreen> 11The melody of this song throws me off when I try to sing it.
<mib_jolsjb> Luna > Nyx > Twilight > Trixie ENOUGH SAID
<Trixie> Byeee
<Starwish> These goggles they do nothing
<mib_jolsjb> Cry more
<RainBroDash> 10silverscreen would you like a link to the fresh prince of anatevka? :P
<books> Bye.
<thunderhooves> this video is nice
<Ersatz> Pretty well written, honestly.
<Trixie> But... Luna... Nyx...
<Trixie> Trixie D:
<Ersatz> A bit dark for the setting, but good characterization.
<Silverscreen> 11RainbroDash: Nah, I'm enjoying ponies.
<Drake> 04Well, you're in trouble
<RainBroDash> 10I just found it, is all
<sotha> Nyx, if I remember correctly is a reborn Nightmare Moon without any of the evil or something. Just read Past Sins
<iHeldAChicken> Bye books
<RainBroDash> 10K :D
<Trixie> Nyx > Nightmare Moon
<Drake> 04Reminds me when I broke by DS' hinge.
<WF_Chronicles> Trixie = Trixie
<mib_jolsjb> -_-
<books> what? I was talking to someone else
<Drake> 04Still broken actually. It's annoying.
<books> I have no idea what's going on anymore
<Aponymous> Trixie is Canon, so she is better than Nyx. >_>
<mib_jolsjb> Ponies forget that Nyx was there in Creeping Darkness
<books> other then I'm sataying here
<iHeldAChicken> Nyx = son of Trixie
<Dashite_Alt> You guys are gonna make me go on a Disney movie marathon. :/
<books> sorrry for the confusion
<Trixie> No
<PixelCoder> OK, what is SW:APT?
<Ghosties> Unfortunately, only a fraction of the people we normally have were here so I'm sure it'll happen later on
*Silverscreen 11can sing pretty good, believe it or not.
<Ghosties> Oh well, I'm not changing who I am
<thunderhooves> DISNEY MOVIES ARE AWESOME
<NightSeas> 12http://www.laptop-repair.info/repair_laptop_hinge.html?
*Silverscreen 11fucking loves classic Disney
<RainbowDoubleDash> Disney was the shit
<Trixie> Nyx is a failed attempt to fully revive Nightmare Moon. They got a small, innocent child instead
<Silverscreen> 11Was
<Trixie> Who grows up to be evil
<HaxBrony> disney WAS
<iHeldAChicken> *Thumbs up for Silverscreen
<RobotPinkie> Who doesn't?
<Flutterpeanut> Okay well. Movies are done and it's almost 1am. I'm outtie.
<SilverMane> why is making a fluttershy parody character for larp so hard?
<Dashite_Alt> Only people without souls don't love classic disney
<Trixie> But don't tell anypony
*FreezeFrame can sing quite well, too. Sings bass, which makes singing popular music hard.
<Dee_Twenty> Star Wars: Apartment? I don't know, that's my only guess.
<YusukeKomiya> dam Past Sins at the moment makes me sad
<ReticentSmolder> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vsQ9W6AYAqg/TjJfROuPvDI/AAAAAAAAJas/hOpHB5wfDJE/s1600/uprising_by_xfizzle-d41zi2d.jpg
<RandomExtra> @pilxelcoder It was Spider's Web: A pig's tale
<iHeldAChicken> Tenor
*RainBroDash 10used to sing loads, but after his voice broke he didn't keep up with singing and never re-trained his voice. Still regrets that.
<Ghosties> Same
<NewManiac> I can sing pretty well.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm done soon myself.
<Silverscreen> 11They're slowly making a comback with Tangled and Princess and the Frog...but it's too slow.
<Aponymous> SPIDERS WEB DOES NOT EXIST!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I know that feeling Lyon
<iHeldAChicken> Likes that album cover
<FreezeFrame> RandomExtra: Sounds like a Charolette's Web ripoff.
<YusukeKomiya> Anyone else thinks that modern mainstream music sucks
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, used to sing well, too, can't anymore
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll put on one more vid and then Epic Sax Spike.
*iHeldAChicken pwns nubs
<Dee_Twenty> I don't think Tangled was Disney.
<NightSeas> 12Dunno how reliable it is, but it does say how to fix a laptop hinge
<PixelCoder> @RandomExtra: Thanks
<Trixie> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131164096441.png Trixie aint got nuttin on that
<RobotPinkie> mostly because of goddamn neighbors
<interior_gummy> it was
<Ghosties> I'm tired, and I'm gonna play a round of KF with some friends to unwind
<Silverscreen> 11Tangled was disney.
<SirSprinkles> 6...also, it's almost a new month, which means new closing time music.
<TGPFluttershy> Such a beautiful song
<sotha> I only listen to music you may have heard of, but probably not.
<Dashite> There we go.
<iHeldAChicken> SELF PROCLAIMED GENIUS
<RainBroDash> 10iHeldAChicken, you think YOU pwn nubs?
<YusukeKomiya> there last fairy tale one
<PixelCoder> @Dee_Twenty: Tangled was Disney.
<Silverscreen> 11...wasn't it?
<iHeldAChicken> YES!
<mib_r5mjsn> I cant believe Disney is done with fairy tales after Tangled! They're doomed
<WF_Chronicles> Yusuke: Kinda, but man. Cee-Lo Green and Fuck You is a great song.
<Chiyo> @Dashite_Alt: exactly what I've been doing. Just finished the sword in the stone, Bambi, and the rescuers. I've been watching the classics.
<iHeldAChicken> I DO!
<Ghosties> D: No, I thought we were keeping epic sax spike?
<Aponymous> Trixie has canon. She doesn't need anything else.
<mib_nyf3km> 0indeed it was
<RobotPinkie> why aren't you allowed to sing loudly in apartments?
<iHeldAChicken> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Did we agree on that?
<WF_Chronicles> Bruno Mares isn't that bad, either.
<Hipster_Brony> 8but...
<YusukeKomiya> ya Fuck You is good
<thunderhooves> im going to go watch Hercules now
<Hipster_Brony> 8epic sax spike...
<Trixie> I fail to see how canon makes somepony automatically superior.
<SirSprinkles> 6I like Epic Sax Spike
<iHeldAChicken> Because you have people living next to you who are complete JERKS
<mib_jolsjb> Just because I can. Nyx originated in Creeping Darkness FanFic. Past Sins wanted to expand upon that OC.
<Dashite> Chiyo nice! :)
<RainbowDoubleDash> mainstream music is too manestream
<Silverscreen> 11I would love to see them redo all their classics in Tangle's style. It's got that Disney feel all over it.
<SirSprinkles> 6I just thought we were gonna change it...
<Ghosties> But..why?
<iHeldAChicken> I'mma sing where I want when I want
<FreezeFrame> It disturbs others, RobotPinkie. Most apartment walls have less soundproofing than space has air.
<books> I'm okay with that
<Bane> hahahahahaha
<SirSprinkles> 6I honestly would prefer to keep Epic Sax Spike.
<NightSeas> 12Is your laptop your main computer?
<Trixie> Trixie is like, the worst pony in the series. Probably, without a doubt, my least favorite pony. I hate Trixie
<interior_gummy> alright, now do http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMOZf1T0wKU&feature=related
<thunderhooves> DONT HURT ME NO MORE
<Ersatz> Don't hurt me, no more
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, because at first we thought it would get old.
<WF_Chronicles> DON'T HURT MER
<Aponymous> Tangled was great. *HEADBOBS*
<mib_r5mjsn> yay
<books> :/
<iHeldAChicken> books you lied.
<WF_Chronicles> NO MORE
<HaxBrony> its official: bronies got the best music on the internet.
<RainBroDash> 10iHeldAChicken: https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/155496_180726935272930_100000068730343_647983_1432329_n.jpg RBD pwns the most n00bs.
<FreezeFrame> *headbobs*
<YusukeKomiya> yes
<SirSprinkles> 6But, it didn't, it got... vintage.
<books> I lied??
<WF_Chronicles> NO MORE
<iHeldAChicken> You said BYE
<Polarfire> fuck,
<Ziltoid> YES
<TGPFluttershy> YES
<Dee_Twenty> NOOOOOOOOOO! Remakes almost ALWAYS suck an infinite amount of horse wangs!
*WF_Chronicles is headbobbing
<books> I already explained,
<GamerGodJones> :D
<iHeldAChicken> oh
<Polarfire> FUCK
<mib_r5mjsn> OH LAWD
<YusukeKomiya> ya thats true
<books> ith thoguht that was someone else
<iHeldAChicken> nevermindsorrylol
<RobotPinkie> lol I know, I'm just annoyed because my neighbor sings all the time, and I have a much more powerful voice than that. :P
<Ghosties> It's our trademark closing time/off the air thing
<books> I apologized
<WF_Chronicles> Well
<books> D:
<RainbowDoubleDash> most male ponies are nothing but plot devices
<WF_Chronicles> The new remake
<interior_gummy> when do we do requests?
<Aponymous> I love Trixie's Hammy bitchiness *HEadbobs*
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<WF_Chronicles> of Thundercats
<sotha> Alright everyone. I am leaving. Thanks for a wonderful night.
<iHeldAChicken> Ok hi again! :D
<WF_Chronicles> is glorious
<SirSprinkles> 6It's good, imo.
<thunderhooves> what is this,love, thing he keeps mentioning?
<WF_Chronicles> it's amazing.
<GamerGodJones> this
<books> I plan on staying here to the last man.
<GamerGodJones> is
<YusukeKomiya> Skips, Godfather of Soul
<TGPFluttershy> This song is an amazing example of the 90's
<NewManiac> Bye, Sotha
<iHeldAChicken> WHAT IS LOVE?
<GamerGodJones> BEAUTIFUL
<iHeldAChicken> I have no idea
<Trixie> Trixie's terrible
<RainbowDoubleDash> I'm slowly starting to hate this song
<thunderhooves> head bang
<Ziltoid> mlp is a show about femenism
<SirSprinkles> 6One thing I will be changing is the gif for Saturday preshows. I normally change it, but I'll be allowing it to reset every month.
<mib_jolsjb> Trixie is the fourth best pony.
<thunderhooves> wooaaahhh'
<Trixie> The fact that I stole her name clearly shows how much I hate her
<mib_r5mjsn> lol
<RainbowFox> It's that other thing besides tolerance
<iHeldAChicken> Head bop
<YusukeKomiya> we need more Big Mac
<RobotPinkie> MLP is a show about ponies.
<SirSprinkles> 6Since people LOVE the Gummy gif.
<iHeldAChicken> ftw
<books> seventh best pony
<books> after the mane 6
<Dee_Twenty> Silly, MLP is a show about masculinism!
<Silverscreen> 11Dee_Twenty: I"m not talling about an all-out remake. I'm just saying they should do a 3-D rendering of their classic movies and put the original audio to it. It would work.
<Trixie> Nyx is best OC
<interior_gummy> best pony is madame le flour
<Aponymous> Also, Trixie has a bitchin' wizard hat and cape.
<mib_jolsjb> Nyx is best OC
<GamerGodJones> pfft, the turnips were better
<FreezeFrame> I need to see if I can find a "Scoot- Scootaloo" ringtone for my new text message tone. After reading Pony Psychology.... I can't use Flutterrage.
<books> she put on her robe and wizard hat
<iHeldAChicken> HAHAHA!
<thunderhooves> but the new coat could ruin the magiks they have
<RainBroDash> ghosties personally I cringed when you mentioned ponies 'going behind your back' cause now it sounds like I've tattled on them or some shit
<YusukeKomiya> no Sir Lints a Lot
<WF_Chronicles> YOU'RE GOING
<WF_Chronicles> TO
<Ersatz> (Spoilers) Nyx turns Fluttershy into a tree
<WF_Chronicles> LOVE ME
<iHeldAChicken> NO!
<Ersatz> And that's why she is best OC pony.
<thunderhooves> lol
<mib_jolsjb> NOOOOO
<Bane> jose!
<books> I'll catch you yet, my pretties.
<Bane> jose!
<SirSprinkles> 6They went to YOU? Oo
<mib_jolsjb> SPOILED
<Gecomol> Spike is the best pony
<Trixie> I like the part where they (spoiler) Twilight by the neck until death
<SirSprinkles> 6The NEW MOD?
<mib_jolsjb> The Game
<WF_Chronicles> Fluttershy liked being a tree.
<Bane> jose! jose! jose!
<Ghosties> Well, like I said, they should voice their concerns to ME
<SirSprinkles> 6TF IS THIS SHIT?
<WF_Chronicles> It was nice!
<Silverscreen> 11I mean, they already make a shitload of money out of "digitally restoring" all the classics, so why not take it to the next level?
*Silverscreen 11headbobs.
<GamerGodJones> Owlicious is better
<Dee_Twenty> Pinkie inflation. This is my fetish. <3
<Ghosties> If it's a problem about me, it should be voiced to me
<interior_gummy> can we at least do http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMOZf1T0wKU&feature=related for tomorrow's play show if you're not doing it now?
<interior_gummy> tomorrow?
<mib_d8n51z> no gokaiger :(
<RainbowDoubleDash> Scootaloo will go to the Y Games and meet Pony Hawk where she will get her cutie mark
<iHeldAChicken> Rock My Pony [No BGM]
<WF_Chronicles> >>implying the fanbase wouldn't crucify disney if they remade classic movies
<RainBroDash> it wasn't specifically you though, it was the general mod feeling
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It's her life
<Srake> Characters doesn't have a k
<mib_jolsjb> I second Interior_gummy decision
<thunderhooves> probably because the 3d would screw with the 2d style of then, you would have to go in and redraw alot of stuff
<WF_Chronicles> there's direct to DVD sequels, and then there's that
<iHeldAChicken> Hoops is best pony
<Aponymous> WF_Chronicles: This is so true.
<RainBroDash> it just makes me sound like I've dicked on them a bit >.>
<YusukeKomiya> they need to redo Mickey Mouse
<Ghosties> And yeah, I'm pretty surprised they went to a new mod. But then, most of them probably were unaware that you were a new mod. That, OR, they noticed that you were pro for the film and sought refuge with you
<Dee_Twenty> >Implying Disney has much of a fanbase left at this point.
<YusukeKomiya> his old cartoons were good
<Silverscreen> 11>> implying they'd be changed in any way outside of the visual style.
<mib_r5mjsn> We need ponies and A Day to Remember.
<thunderhooves> that would mess with the style and change it ultimately
<NewManiac> I'm gonna hit they hay, guys. I had fun. Goodbye.
<Denied_Existence> Heh
<NightSeas> 12lol
<HaxBrony> o hai madden
<RobotPinkie> lol Disney pretty much has the biggest fanbase in the world, still
<interior_gummy> john madden
<Denied_Existence> Guten Nacht
<iHeldAChicken> LUUUL TROLLESTIA
<GamerGodJones> John Madden!
<FreezeFrame> I still love 80s Cheerilee
<iHeldAChicken> Zecora ftw
<mib_jolsjb> Wasn't it in the interview with the director of MLP that if they could they would make a 3D animated version of MLP movie but it would look 2D
<Ghosties> Well, as far as I could tell, it was just me really vocalizing my opinion on the film
<NightSeas> 12I think all of our lives are our computeres XD
<Dee_Twenty> Pixar's fanbase doesn't count, they have their own style.
<Aponymous> '80s Cheerilee needs her own episode.
<thunderhooves> the audi would probably be redone, you can only remaster so much ya know
<interior_gummy> i took a personality test and got zecora
<WF_Chronicles> they wouldn't reuse the old audio tracks, they'd use the new animation as an excuse to hire new voice actors
<WF_Chronicles> and then
<YusukeKomiya> like Street Fighter 4
<WF_Chronicles> they could just fuck with the movie
<NightSeas> 12computers*
<SirSprinkles> 6Speaking of which... I think it's promotion time, for both RBD and Sathi... agreed Ghosties and Hipster?
<WF_Chronicles> all they want.

<GamerGodJones> 0all and all its a great way to stay in shape

<Denied_Existence> Try me

<PonyofDuality> DEATH NOTE!!
<YusukeKomiya> any1 ever read The Art of War
<SirSprinkles> 6It was the timespan of like, three weeks in pony time.
<ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff> 1000 subscribers
<Denied_Existence> Go on
<PonyofDuality> MLP VS DEATH NOTE
<FreezeFrame> I think Angry Pony Polka is better than the first one, personally.
<mib_jolsjb> I saw the last part of my dream. It had Luna in it. She was talking to me. She told me that it was time to wake up.
<Ziltoid> dat buffer

<mib_jolsjb> As I was reading/experiencing the words I slowly began to stir. I woke up with a bit of a start.
<books> ಠ_ಠ
<SirSprinkles> 6Sexy Naughty Bitchy Rarity
<FreezeFrame> Of course, I just like Angry White Boy Polka.
<GamerGodJones> 0OH MY LORD
<TGPFluttershy> Oh wow
<ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff> >reading in a dream
<ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff> how
<GamerGodJones> 0i cant get this song out of my head
<mib_jolsjb> It looked like a comic.
<GamerGodJones> 0thanks for refreshing it
<mib_jolsjb> I found experience sounds and see like I was a floating ghost.
<mib_jolsjb> I don't remember much of the dream.
<mib_jolsjb> But I will never forget those last words.
<FreezeFrame> I had a dream turn into a nightmare because of the general inability to read in a dream.
<SirSprinkles> 6I rarely remember most of my dreams, especially the lucid ones.
<books> same problem here, sir
<ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff> any lucid dream I have is life-like. But as soon as I try to reach out with my mind to alter it I wake up. shit sucks
<books> Maybe i had and wasted a pony dream. D:
<YusukeKomiya> I had a dream that felt like years past by. I got married, Japan was attacked by North Korea and China
<FreezeFrame> Of course, normally when I try to read in a dream, I open my actual eyes (not my dreamself eyes). Because I suddenly feel my eyes being closed.
<junh1024-XD> !shinywalk
*Shiny-Growlithe goes on a walk with junh1024-XD
<Denied_Existence> Whenever I seem to have dreams, whatever I dream ends up happening...no lie.
<YusukeKomiya> I fought them then I was saved by U.S. Army stationed in japan
<mib_jolsjb> I'll give you some advice if you want to Lucid dream.
<SirSprinkles> 6Denied, precognitive dreams are not uncommon.
<mib_jolsjb> It's hard, and random for me. But your best bet is if you wake up calmly. Just keep your eyes closed. That's so important.
<SirSprinkles> 6I get them a lot.
<FreezeFrame> My dreams tend to start with boring day-to-day stuff, transitioning to jRPG-scale adventures.
<FreezeFrame> Like going down an elevator in a grocery store to fight a dragon.
<ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff> Yep I have prophetic dreams occasionally, freaks me out
<YusukeKomiya> one time i was a samurai (kinda) wanderin around the Philippines fighting corruption in local areas
<CircuitMane> I don't have prophetic ones, but damn I get some crazy ones that are full of more adventure then a week long Final Fantasy Binge
<SaladMuffin> Naturally
<RainbowDoubleDash> Dreams are always crazy random and unpredictable... trapped within my body... and keep waking up without actually waking up
<Kaezone> would it be alright if you guys watch my PMV?
<ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff> My dreams are usually me starting somewhere mundane when all of the sudden i'm LEAPING OUT OF THE 9TH FLOOR OF MY DORM BECAUSE ZOMBIE VIRUS IS INFECTING EVERYTHING NOW i HAVE TO RUN 800 MILES TO NEW YORK CITY BECAUSE ARK SHIPS ARE GOING TO TAKE US INTO OUTERSPACE AND then I wake up.
<CircuitMane> Will we burn our eyes and beg for release of the horrid memory if we watch it?
<SirSprinkles> 6My precognitive dreams span time spans of MONTHS or even YEARS before happening exactly as they happened in the dream.
<TTG> Hey brones
<Denied_Existence> Bak again
<RDash> RainbowDoubleDash good thing we're watching inception then eh?
<Kaezone> lol no

<ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff> BWOOOOOOOON
<Denied_Existence> GO DEEPER
<mib_jolsjb> That was probably my most vivid pony dream.
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't have precognitive dreams. I have flashes of precognition.
<YusukeKomiya> does any1 ever wish every1 would stop arguing about stuff like the existance of God and just mind their own business
<TTG> 3gently, please
<Nittany_Tiger> While I'm awake.
<TTG> 3d'oh
<mib_jolsjb> I've had a few others. I recall "having" them but no memory of what happened.
<RainbowDoubleDash> also there's an invisible demon in my closet... you know the usual
<TTG> 0no colors for you
<mib_jolsjb> Only that I was generally incredibly at peace after them.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yusuke, I know that feel
<PonyofDuality> "We couldn't fit it all in."
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, TTG, colors are for mods only
<YusukeKomiya> Everythin would b better if we all just act good, doesnt matter wat one belives in religious wise
<ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff> My opinion on God is, we won't know the answer until we close out eyes for good, so just live.
<books> pretty.
<ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff> our'
<RainbowDoubleDash> yet to have a pony related dream... only boring human dreams
<mib_jolsjb> Luna > Nyx > Twilight > Trixie

<TTG> 0read Past Sins

<Denied_Existence> Shoot
<RainbowDoubleDash> because opinions on the internet totally matter
<Polarfire> ...
<Denied_Existence> I think they do
<SirSprinkles> 6What would you think of a series of videos about the mods, like a TF2 meet the team kind of thing.
