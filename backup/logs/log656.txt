<Panda|Sleepies> I WILL NOT LISTEN!
<Pirate4> 00,02hey, listen
<sub06905> shove 7 dyes in hair amd hope for the best
<EonMaster> Look out!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02If they make a Zelda game exactly like this, I think I would just pass out right then and there O.O
<LongJohnPoly> Oh wow
<Pirate4> 00,02attack the shiny bit
<Kandarihu> I heard Navi
<Moopy> i rather not go with the duck tape dude it hurts when you pull it off
<Piratejazz> I learned a lesson.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Love the reaction when they revealed the name of the Wii U XD
<Piratejazz> Never challenge a Rush.
<Pirate4> 00,02WII U
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02IKR
<Pirate4> 00,02these names are going to get out of hand real fast
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I would have been kind of dissappointed if they left the circle pads on the final version
<sub06905> Wii mad tons of money, U gave us that money
<sub06905> made*
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:P
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Love how everyone thought the baseball game was somehow a part of the Wii U experience XD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Until it turns out later that it actually was o-o
<Piratejazz> Am I still the only one who'd buy the Wii U for Zombie U?
<sub06905> lol
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02ZombiU is a cool game :)
<Panda|Sleepies> and then Panda only bought the Wii U to draw on it.
<Piratejazz> It's ambitious.
<Piratejazz> I'll give it that.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Best part is when they showed Zelda HD in this trailer :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Then the dissapointment when it turns out it wasn't an actual planned game yet ;3;
<Piratejazz> Oh. The WiiU has HD capabilities?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yup, up to 1080p
<Piratejazz> That's news to me.
<Piratejazz> Huh.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Why would they stick to 480p in their newest system?
<Piratejazz> Might look into it if I'm tired of the PS4.
<Panda|Sleepies> because nintendo is worst pony
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02If they did that, I'm sure it would fail for sure.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02No it's not ;~;
<Piratejazz> I 'unno. I was wondering why they didn't do that in the first place.
<sub06905> but i like nintendo ;__;
<Panda|Sleepies> wow... I should be sleep
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02They didn't realize how fast HD would expand in the market
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02They thought of it as a slow growing market
<XAX> I own a GameBoy. The grey brick one.
<Pirate4> 00,02people keept yelling at nintendo for the wiimotes and motion controll
<XAX> That's the only Nintendo product I have.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Back when the PS3 and Xbox 360 came out, it was still relatively new tech in TVs
<Pirate4> 00,02but its not nintendo that was the issue
<Pirate4> 00,02silly devs misusing it was the problem
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02When they realized that most families have HDTVs now, they realized it was crucial to include it with their system.
<Pirate4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, from what i've read the lack of hd was a selling point for the wii
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02No way
<sub06905|zzz> im off to bed night everypony :)
<Pirate4> 00,02things were playable on the massive base on sd screens
<Piratejazz> ...wat.
<XAX> Remember that time when Xbox thought they came up with a never before thought of idea with Kinect?
<Piratejazz> Gnight, sub06905|zzz. Sleep well.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Night sub06905|zzz :)
<XAX> Lol, eye-toy.
<Pirate4> 00,02night sub06905|zzz
<Piratejazz> HDtvs have SD jacks, though.
<Pirate4> 00,02XAX, eye toy was fun
<Pirate4> 00,02Piratejazz, but not the other way round
<XAX> Pirate4: That it was
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The selling point with the Wii was its low price point and motion controls
<Moopy> Cool i got me some grapes and got me 2 oranges
<Piratejazz> Pirate4, oh wait. I see.
<Pirate4> 00,02but yeah, by now everyone has an hd screen
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But now that PS3 and Xbox 360 are cheaper in price and they include motion controls, there was no longer a true benefit to having the Wii.
<Piratejazz> But the other consoles has SD ports too.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02So it was time for the Wii U to come out to compete with the other systems while doing something new that the other systems couldn't compete with.
<Pirate4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, i've got all 3 consoles, two of them are broken
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Which two? o.o
<Pirate4> 00,02guess which works
*JRP2234 slaps Pirate4 around a bit with a large trout
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Wii? :3
<Pirate4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, those buggers never die
<Piratejazz> I'm going to say the PS3?
*Panda|Sleepies slaps JRP2234 around a bit with a large trout
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Well...mine died after my friends kept knocking it over on its side while playing Brawl with the GCN controllers >>
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Had to replace the disc drive
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But other than that, it was fixed good as new :)
<XAX> I brought my desktop out into the lounge and tried to play the vidya games on my 40'. A) There was a delay time that was just noticeable enough from when I moved my mouse to when it moved on screen that made games unplayable for ME. B) I was squinting the whole time because I'm not used to playing games on a TV.
<Piratejazz> Probably needed to sit closer to the screen.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Darn
<JRP2234> Epic Movie
<JRP2234> no kick for me
<Piratejazz> I might actually buy a Wii U for alot of benificial reasons.
<JRP2234> trying to find micas hidden kick words
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I think you mean Fight Club
<JRP2234> Fight CLub
<XAX> sumi has secret kick words?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Sumica probably disabled that script ><
<Piratejazz> Had.

<Moopy> there we go
<Piratejazz> I're winner.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I like watching reaction videos :3
<Piratejazz> Hey, SB, the tablet /can/ play games without a TV screen right?
<Pirate4> 00,02< this is as powerfull as a game console needs to be
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Piratejazz: Yup
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Pirate4: yuppers :P
<Piratejazz> NewSuperBronyU, so does that mean one can just buy a Wii U and not even need a TV?
<JRP2234> NewSuperBronyU play castlevania
<Piratejazz> Like just play from bed and stuff.
<Pirate4> 00,02after this all you can do is improve details. we're at the point where the difference is art and not tech
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Piratejazz: But it depends on which Wii U game you play. HOWEVER, I believe you can play ALL Wii games on the Gamepad.
<Piratejazz> NewSuperBronyU, damn. Really just want one for ZombiU.

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02PirateStar: O.O
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hai Resonantwaves :D
<Resonantwaves> :3
<AdamThePirate> ohai Resonantwaves
<Resonantwaves> howdy!
<Dark__Horst> incredible graphics....
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02ikr :D
<AdamThePirate> Realism and CoD in the same sentense? o.o
<AdamThePirate> This doesn't add up
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yesh it does :<
<AdamThePirate> :P
<Dark__Horst> not really
<Dark__Horst> want incredible graphics? go get crysis 1
<Resonantwaves> o3o whats everyone doing
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Resonantwaves: Watching Nintendo o3o
<Resonantwaves> awwwww yeaaaaaaaa
<Piratereins> i'm baaack, outside of home is stormy...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Only thing that I hope looks better than it actually sounds is the resolution of the Gamepad screen...
<AdamThePirate> Arrrrrrrrrg
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The resolution is 854x480
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Still perfect for regular Wii games though
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I want this game at launch ;3;
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I just wonder how the online features will work...will it have DLC? Achievements? Universal Friend List?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Nintendo still hasn't revealed the main OS that runs all this together
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But it takes up half the memory of the system, so it must be pretty impressive
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,021 GB out of the total 2 GB
<Pirate4> 00,02thats a point, they're actually going to have an operating system this time
<Gold_Demona> Good morning Bronystate
<Dark__Horst> sounds like windows to me
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02They had an operating system before, but it really wasn't a unified one while playing games and such
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hey Gold_Demona :)
<Pirate4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, technically speaking i meen
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Every game console has an OS on it though
<Pirate4> 00,02the wii didnt have an operating system by the clasical definition
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02What do you define as the classical definition? >>
<Pirate4> 00,02when you launched a game it handed controll to the games software, the wii dashbord doesnt exist while your running
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Techincally it does
<Pirate4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, a resource sharing subsystem
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02It just doesn't allow you access to it
<Kandarihu|ARRRRRRRRR> If I recall, thar be a surly swarm of Miis standing around each game.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The Wii OS didn't support Multitasking is all
<Pirate4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, and no, its not there, the thing that pops up when you press the home button isnt the dashboard, its actually implimented in every game
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02No it's not, that's the Wii's OS running in a limited fashion while running the game.
<Pirate4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, beleive me, it isnt
<Princess_Cadence> o3o?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Source?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Because the Wii does utilize some of its memory for running the OS in the background, but not much.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hence why it's limited to what you can do when you press the Home button
<Piratejazz> Personally, I only liked the multiplayer of CoD.
<Piratejazz> But MW3's was pretty terrible imo.
<Piratejazz> I much much prefered BO's.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I hope ELITE is compatible with the Wii U version
<Gold_Demona> My cousin plays CoD, but I have no idea which one it is. =/
<Piratejazz> Just assume it's MW3/
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I also hope the Wii U version comes with the Care Package version of the game >>
<Gold_Demona> I think it's Black Ops, but I wouldn't swear to it
<Phase4> 00,02and then my connection died
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z81BCko-UY and the ascisciated blogs and wiki pages
<Piratejazz> And then Pirate tiem died with Pirate4.
<valoreins> i remember my brig bro said TF2 is the same as MW3... lol
<valoreins> big*
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, if one wants to get technical, there is the os on the starlet, but that doesnt handle the dashboard
<AdamThePirate> And a late hello to you Gold_Demona :P
<Piratejazz> Tbh, the ONLY thing MW3 had in comparison was its Single Player.
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo AdamThePirate
<Piratejazz> Also, hai Gold_Demona.
<Yarrflash> Gday everyone.
<Gold_Demona> Pirates... Pirates everywhere. :O
<Piratejazz> Dat Yarrflash. Long time no see.
<Yarrflash> Yarr.
<Phase4> 00,02yay~ i just did an intercontinental flight in ksp
<Kandarihu|ARRRRRRRRR> Gold_Demona, ARRRRRR
<Yarrflash> Ikr Piratejazz ^^ busy busy.
<AdamThePirate> Arrrrrrg
<Phase4> 00,02now to try land
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02What part of the video talks about it?
<Pirate_Gold_Demona> ARRRR
<Piratejazz> Mmmm. Hope your schedules becomes more lax then, Yarrflash.
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, i'm not sure exactly
<Phase4> 00,02oh, this bit
<Piratejazz> Yar.
<Yarrflash> I'm happy with how it is right now though :)
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, 'ios' is the persistant part that runs on the starlet
<Yarrflash> I can help people & stuff. So that's good.
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, 'broadway' is the cpu, games run on that and when a game is running it controls the broadway in its entirety
<Piratejazz> Hmmm. Good to hear.
<Yarrflash> ^-^
<Yarrflash> So how are you then, Piratejazz?
<Piratejazz> Phase4, does this mean Pirate tiem is over?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,0264 MB to 2 GB is pretty legit :)
<Piratejazz> Yarrflash, been better. school started.
<Pirate_Gold_Demona> Yarr!
<Phase4> 00,02Piratejazz, i'm just not bothering, cant talk like pirate
<Yarrflash> Yarr, Pirate_Gold_Demona :)
<Piratejazz> NEVER STOPPED US BEFORE!
*Yarrflash glomps NewSuperBronyU
<Wirisme> Oh shit I just realised what day it is
<Yarrflash> mfw you changed yer name because U :3
<Yarrflash> YARR, Wirisme~
<Wirisme> YARRRRRRR... every year dammit
<Pirate_Gold_Demona> Arrrr
<AdamThePirate> Hehe, why don't you name yourself Gold_Demonaarrrg, Pirate_Gold_Demona
<Pirate_Gold_Demona> Arrr, that be a fine idear
<Phase4> 00,02most of these bugs happened because the main dev team was in japan while the people working on ios were contractors in the us
<Kandarihu|ARRRRRRRRR> NewSuperBronyU, Aye, so THIS be your contribution to Talk like a Pirate Day?
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu|ARRRRRRRRR, this is actually about getting homebrew code onto the wii
<AdamThePirate> arrrrrg
<TheRandomkid321> ly have a facebook friend request to someone with the name "Katie". Seems legit.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Why is it 'Talk-Like-A-Pirate' Day? ><
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, i have no idea
*NewSuperBronyU hugs Yarrflash back :D
<AdamThePirate> Tis be a ninja I say TheRandomkid321
<Piratejazz> Because Captain Phase4.
<Piratejazz> Oi, Phase4. YOU STARTED THIS! :D
<TheRandompirate321> ARRGH! IMA DRINK ME RUM!
<Gold_DemonaArrrgh> Arrr!
<Yarrflash> NewSuperBronyU: it's because pirates are cool. Yarrr.
<AdamThePirate> Arrrrrrrrrrrrg!~
<Phase4> 00,02Piratejazz, XD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02So you're saying that each game has to include code on the discs to run the Wii Home Menu OS?
<TheRandompirate321> YAHAHA I'M OFF TO R@PE THE VILLAGE WOMEN!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02And it's up to the game maker as to how much memory is allocated to running it?
<Piratejazz> ...we're not that kind of pirate crew.
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, the home menu is stored on the wii, the behaviour of the home button is implimented on the game disks
<TheRandompirate321> ANND MURDER THEIR HUSBANDS! THEN R@APE THEM AGAIN! THEN STEAL THEIR GOLD!
<Phase4> 00,02to get back to the home menu it reboots
<TheRandompirate321> Piratejazz We're not?
<Gold_DemonaArrrgh> Yarr, I swing not that way, TheRandompirate321
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The Home menu I refer to what happens when you press the Home button on the Wii Remote
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You just said that OS isn't running by the system, it's running by the game
<Piratejazz> TheRandompirate321, /we're/ not.
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, the ingame bit where it gives you a button to return to the home menu, THAT is on the disk, the home menu itself is stored on the wii.
<Phase4> 00,02when a game is running, the home menu isnt
<Phase4> 00,02in contrast to the xbox 360 and ps3 where it runs in the background
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I know they run the OS in the background
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Most likely, if they did it, it was to maximize the amount of memory running for a particular game by the game developer
<TheRandompirate321> DO WE STILL GET TO DRINK RUM!?
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, when a game is running its the only thing running on the main cpu
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02So that they could utilize less memory to run the Home Menu in the background while offering more for the actual game
<Phase4> 00,02it gets all the memory, all the devices, everything
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But the game has to allocate some memory to running that Home menu should the user press the Home button
<Gold_DemonaArrrgh> The rum is gone.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Otherwise it doesn't work
<TheRandompirate321> WHY IS THE RUM GONE!?
<Yarrflash> ^
<Piratejazz> Why is the rum always gone?
<AdamThePirate> Arrg nay, we get to drink frying pan, tf2 style~
<Gold_DemonaArrrgh> Because I drank it! >8D
<Piratejazz> Thou be a scallywag!
<TheRandompirate321> AdamThePirate Yaah that game don't work for me no more.
<Gold_DemonaArrrgh> Arrr! :D
<Resonantwaves> o3o
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, how the game impliments the home menu is up to the game, afaik nintendo's dev kits include the code to do that, but clicking 'return to the home menu' reboots the cpu
<Phase4> 00,02and it restarts in the home menu
<Princess_Cadence> hmm..............
<AdamThePirate> Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free~
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02What you refer to as the 'Home Menu' is different to how I refer to it
<AdamThePirate> You are a pirate!~
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, yeah, we're getting stuck there
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome|Sleep: are u awake?
<Gold_DemonaArrrgh> Yar har fiddle-dee dee!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The Channels Menu is the main menu that you see when the system starts up
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02From there you can access all the games and such you have stored on the system
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The Home Menu is the menu that appears when you press the 'Home' Button
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The Home menu is completely different from the Channels menu
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The Home menu is the only thing that runs when a game is being played
<DoctoDoctorWho> the channels menu is what I belive he is refering to here NewSuperBronyU
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The Channels Menu can't be played at all by the game due to the lack of memory in having it run
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, http://derpy.me/64Hkq << this bit is stored on the game disk and controlled by the game
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yes, that's the 'HOME Menu' :P
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, http://www.scendix.com/jaast/images/setup_wii_menu.jpg this bit is stored on the wii
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The HOME Menu is completely separate from the Channels menu
<DoctoDoctorWho> well, Im off!
<Phase4> 00,02and it stopps running, removes itself from memory, and transfers controll of the cpu to the game when it starts
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Later DoctoDoctorWho :)
<Piratejazz> Gnight, DoctoDoctorWho. Plunder well in thar dreams.
<AdamThePirate> Night DoctoDoctorWho
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02That's why I'm saying, the developer is in full control of how much memory can be allocated to running the HOME Menu
<DoctoDoctorWho> actually I just got up, this is my morning visit. To a new day of glory and plunder!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02If Nintendo isn't controlling it from the main Channels OS on the system, then the developer is free to controlling what it does
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, point is the 'home menu' isnt part of an operating system, its on the game
<AdamThePirate> Arrrrrrrg!~
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yeah, that's what I'm trying to agree with you here silly :P
*Phase4 00,02hugs NewSuperBronyU
*NewSuperBronyU hugs Phase4 back :3
<Piratejazz> FRIENDSHIP!
<Lil_B> hi every :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The HOME Menu, because it's dependent on how the developer uses it, can choose to allocate less memory in having it run in the background while the game is played and thus use more of it to run the game
<Lil_B> oh, Console hacking :D
<Piratejazz> I cristen our new ship the FriendShip!
*Piratejazz hugs Lil_B all pirate like.
<AdamThePirate> Welcome aboard Lil_B, arrrg!~
*AdamThePirate hugs Lil_B *pat pat*
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hence why some high performing games don't show a blurried snapshot of what's on the screen when you open the Home Menu so that it doesn't waste precious memory resources to storing that image to be displayed in the background
<Lil_B> are we pirate themed?
<Gold_DemonaArrrgh> YARR!~
<Piratejazz> For now.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But most of the time it's worthless to consider for how most developers develop games for the system
<AdamThePirate> Yarrrr that be correct, international talk like a pirate day!~
<Gold_DemonaArrrgh> It be Talk Like a Pirate Day. Yarr
*Lil_B gives Piratejazz AdamThePirate a skirrrrrvvy hug
<Lil_B> I
<Phase4> 00,02<< the dvd-video bug was actually exploited and eventually a softmod to play burned games was made
<Lil_B> I'll be Guybrush threepwood :3
<XAX> God DAMN my iPod just dropped hard on my face. I need to stop holding it above myself.
<Piratejazz> Oh noes! Not the dread skurvy.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02That's the only reason I can think of as to why Nintendo wouldn't run the code on the system end itself
<Phase4> 00,02absolute pain to install but it exists
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Nintendo failed at coding their Wii system, hence why it has all this homebrew stuff.
<Lil_B> I wanna see of they hack the WiiU XD
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, well theres not a lot of cpu to play with, not having an operating system sitting betwene your game and the system only gains you about 10% but you sometimes need that
<Lil_B> at least Nintendo wasn't such an Asshole about their consoles getting hacked like Sony XD
<Yarrflash> I just realized.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02With only 64 MB of RAM, you need all of it you can get with the system.
<Yarrflash> I really like the 25c3 logo.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Especially for games like CoD
<EpicMario50> yay nintendo forever
<XAX> >mfw CoD running on 64mb of ram
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, plus not having an os meens you dont talk to an os, instead you talk directly to the hardware
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02That's one of the reasons why the Wii version didn't get killcams and certain killstreaks that other consoles had. Not because of the processing power, it was because of the RAM.
<Phase4> 00,02theres all kinds of tricks you can do with direct hardware access
<Phase4> 00,02brb,
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The Map data couldn't be entirely stored on the RAM, it had to be constantly read from the disc
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02So the result was two things
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02One, the game couldn't load a different section of the map fast enough for Killcams or even use killstreaks that gave a full view of the map.
<EpicMario50> T_T
<Shane> is there a stream on atm?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Two, the disc drive had to be CONSTANTLY checking the disc for Map data and thus texture loading suffered and the Wii drives died early on because they were putting on a huge amount of stress than what other games were putting on it.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Shane: Yesh
<Lil_B> wait, what Systenm are tehy currently talking about? This doesn't sound like the Wii they are talking about
<Shane> NewSuperBronyU: r u streaming?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Shane: Yesh :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02This is the Wii Lil_B
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02And why the system is fail from a developer perspective
<Shane> NewSuperBronyU: u streaming games with music in the background?
<Lil_B> oh
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Shane: No o.o
<Shane> NewSuperBronyU: k
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But on the plus side of all this
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The Wii is easily hackable so you can do so much with it without the need for a Mod chip or any hardware modification.
<Shane> NewSuperBronyU: permission to link a youtube video
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Shane: Go ahead :)
<Moopy> Im off to hit the hay everypony see yall in the morning oh and a YEAH TOAST aight late

<Ryunosuke> wow
<EpicMario50> NewSuperBronyU: oh
<Ryunosuke> no
<Ryunosuke> bad

<Ryunosuke> evil vile wow :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> EpicMario50, may I kindly ask, So what?
<AdamThePirate> Yep that sounds like like good ol' Wrek
<Piratejazz> Or that one time he was playing Infected Mushroom all the time.

<CK|Catnap> Jump-scares are not really all that frightening in the long term, though. >_>
<SpeedyBolt> True.
<Tiberium> dont you remember what pinkie said about being scared?
<TheRandompirate321> Argh it be true
<SpeedyBolt> Giggle at the Slendies?
<Tiberium> yes
<CK|Catnap> I'm watching Two Best Friends play it, and I kinda agree with Matt, Slender is pissing me off. The game is almost BORING, honestly, and once you know its gimmick you're basically just waiting for the screen to try another lame jump scare.
<Gold_DemonaArrrgh> Avast me arse!

<Phase4> 00,02the chute opens at 600 meters
<TheRandompirate321> It's possible. Then you unlock ye daylight mode. and the the TWENTY GOLD PEICES mode.
<SpeedyBolt> He just....popped up right infront of me
<Phase4> 00,02if the rocket is facing down, the cute gets torn off
<SpeedyBolt> GIVE ME 20 DOLLARS

<Piratejazz> Hell, I might even be Ponyjazz. Just maybe.
<Piratejazz> But that's stupid and will never happen.
<d3rb> Gold_DemonaArrrgh, that is awesome
<AdamThePirate> Oh God Gold_DemonaArrrgh :D
<MadSurge> Gold_DemonaArrrgh: Ohai

*ParrotSurge wants a cracker
*Gold_DemonaArrrgh gives ParrotSurge a cracker
<Phase4> 00,02basically we go up
<Phase4> 00,02and then we fall to the planet over there
<ParrotSurge> d3rb: even when you fail you succeed in Kerbal :D
<Nyst> Would a solid booster be too powerful for leaving Mun?
<Phase4> 00,02failure is half the fun
<ParrotSurge> Gold_DemonaArrrgh: *nom*
<Gold_DemonaArrrgh> There's no such thing as too powerful
<ParrotSurge> ^
<d3rb> ParrotSurge, that should be on their website
<Nyst> Failure is a learning state.
<ParrotSurge> ^
<Piratejazz> Mission Failed just means Lesson Learned.
<d3rb> im learning like crazy tonight then
<TheRandompirate321> Yame throught be hurtin
<Nyst> Think you have enough fuel left to...oh you let go.
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, for minmus?
<Nyst> You should really use that leftover fuel to try and land on the launch platform.
<Phase4> 00,02MAYBE, but i'm not a good enough pilot
<Nyst> Or Minmus, hadn't thought of that.
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, no where near enough
<ParrotSurge> Aww, it's nice to see chat people come back because pony season is getting close :)
<PsychoticDoc> now to spend 30 minutes listening to music before school
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, i would have to slow from like 4km/s to 2
<Nyst> You have enough fuel to get into kerbal orbit with fuel left over no?
<Phase4> 00,02enough to get me into the atmosphere
<Phase4> 00,02many times more than enough but doing orbital manouvers as well takes even more
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, i meen i COULD air break, but not that good yet
<Nyst> I'm not saying you need to airbreak. You can still land just the command pod with a parachute.
<killerpony7733> PsychoticDoc Hardly most you see now are regulars it usually has over 100 users around the right time in a day.
<Nyst> But you'd land it with the launchpad visibly nearby.
<TheRandompirate321> Pirate day over AdamTheDuck?
<PsychoticDoc> wut
<PsychoticDoc> im lost
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, couldnt land it, it cant slow itself down in the atmosphere

<Jim_Hawkins> You haven't missed much
<Saturn> 08,01and... honestly, the drought of reading and writing skills in some of those kids was terrifying
<Saturn> 08,01and the attitudes
<Jim_Hawkins> That's public school for ya
<LongJohnSylver> ^
<Saturn> 08,01and, apparently, a lot of the parents actively *dissuade* their children from learning and doing schoolwork
<MLP_Brovakiin> what?
<LongJohnSylver> ...seriously?
<MLP_Brovakiin> thats stupid
<Saturn> 08,01because they don't think school is important

<Saturn> 08,01Magic_Pony: i was just at school
<Magic_Pony> you too?
<Unnr> Saturn: Because Jackson thought it would look better in the long run, it allows the camera to catch more of the little details
<Magic_Pony> nothing
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: i tried to read the book; it was painful to me after a few chapters
<Magic_Pony> nobody reads Harry Potter here,right?

<HavokOC> Ahoy RaveBrony
<Dken2021> so you are going?
<Unnr> MadSurge: Think about Tom. Tom is the master of the deepest, darkest part of a dangerous, deadly wood. He is able to wear the One Ring without ANYTHING happening to him. This implies several things, such as Tom Bombadil is secretly the Witch King of Agmar, or better yet, he is the Secret Fire incarnate.
*RaveBrony waves to Dken2021, Barbetos, Serenity, and HavokOC
<Magic_Pony> im not going

<Unnr> Barbetos: The invisibility of the One Ring is explained to be because it draws your being into the Wraith realm, the realm of spirit. To wear the one ring and not be effected implies you already wholy exist in the spirit realm

<Pearly> they have naught dog, and rockstar and other companies
<JT> Uhm me? , nope
<Pearly> why what about b2 in russia?
<JunkerKun> 2K made Borderlands 2 in Russia only with russian translation and avialable to play only with Russian versions
<JT> oh
<JunkerKun> The joke is that Baltic region pays European price but gets Russian version
<Pearly> hey have translations all over

<JT> well not really bad , more wrong...
<JunkerKun> JT: song about clopping?
<JT> Eeyup
<JunkerKun> Pearly: Yeah, and to make us, who don't want to play russian version, to pay more

<DaringDerpy> body swap?
<DaringDerpy> why?
<Dken2021> dunno
<Dken2021> how would you even write for that?
<AJIsAwesome> It's funny because most of that stuff actually happened in season 2. :D
<Lil_B> Dken2021 magic
<alexxm> Bronysith whos the guy with derpy
<Lil_B> Dken2021 thats how they explaibned time travel XD
<DaringDerpy> the spike episode was meh
<DaringDerpy> like expected
<DaringDerpy> as? as.
<Dken2021> well I mean like a plot point for a children's show
<AJIsAwesome> I actully kind of liked it.
<LindsyaThePony> hi
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, LindsyaThePony :)
<Dken2021> lali-ho LindsyaThePony
<DaringDerpy> I need to watch most of the episodes several times to like them
<DaringDerpy> hi LindsyaThePony
<DaringDerpy> they don't carry this innocent season 1 atmosphere anymore
<Cades[Phone]> hey
<Applejack2011> hi
<Kimori> hi
<Kimori> have to go for now, bbl
<DaringDerpy> hm...
<DaringDerpy> episodes without twilight sparkle
<DaringDerpy> can't be good by definition
<AJIsAwesome> Family Appreciation day?
<Lil_B> hia lindsey
<AJIsAwesome> Sisterhooves Social?
<alexxm> how are you LindsyaThePony
<Sylandest> I'd go for a Big Mac episode, or Rainbow Dash's secret
<Lil_B> hia LindsyaThePony *
<Applejack2011> hi
<AJIsAwesome> Those episodes didn't have Twilight in them.
<alexxm> DaringDerpy sister hooves social
<LindsyaThePony> im good :$
<Applejack2011> I loved that Spike episode
<SafariMonkey> Hello LindsyaThePony
<Dken2021> huh, there's should be another category that's needed in that bingo, like episode of AJ on her own
<AJIsAwesome> Applejack2011: ^
<DaringDerpy> I don't like the cmc either ^^
<Lil_B> I wanna see the Scootaloo episode Lauren talked about and something involving changelings
<Applejack2011> me too LilB
<DaringDerpy> aj had a role in the derpy episode ^^
<Applejack2011> ^
<alexxm> Lil_B what was the scootaloo episode supposed to be about?
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Lil_B> is it just me or did 7 people just wrote something at the same time?
<Bronysith> idc about scootaloo I WANT AN APPLEJACK SONG
<Cades[Phone]> alright cys
<Cades[Phone]> cya
<DaringDerpy> it was you
<Applejack2011> Want AJ song too
<Lil_B> oj its just my chat XD
<AJIsAwesome> True, but Scootaloo has NO development ata ll.
<AJIsAwesome> * at all
<AJIsAwesome> Besides being a young RD.
<Lil_B> Lauren said that she wanted to make a episode for her, but so far it hasn't been done, but she has a background
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: I know. I hope that happens, though.
<AJIsAwesome> Hope that other episod with RD and AJ happens, too.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: there's still chance for that to happen in season 3 :D
<Lil_B> alexxm scootaloo is not supposed to fly and Lauren said she wanted to make a episode where she has to face the fact that she will never reach this goal
<alexxm> huh that seems depressing
<DaringDerpy> strong stuff
<Lil_B> alexxm I know I don't know if Hasbro will be ok with that
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: Depressing, yes. But it's a very strong lesson as well.
<DaringDerpy> I wonder how they want to present this to the kids
<DaringDerpy> or how she wants to do it
<Lil_B> DaringDerpy Lauren want, but it's questionable if Hasbro will let this happen
<Applejack2011> Hope for AJ and Fluttershy together
<Applejack2011> episode
<DaringDerpy> hasbro will let it happen if the script is good
<DaringDerpy> traumatizing 4yo kids is not an option
<DaringDerpy> no idea how to do it
<DaringDerpy> but I'm no scriptwriter
<DaringDerpy> aj and fluttershy...animals...
<Applejack2011> trees...
<DaringDerpy> haha
<Lil_B> I wanna see an grown up episode, lke the flashback episode from S1
<AJIsAwesome> Not me.
<Dken2021> like a flashfoward episode?
<Lil_B> yes
<Applejack2011> me tooLil
<Applejack2011> ¨lil
<AJIsAwesome> I'm nt sure if i want that to happen.
<AJIsAwesome> It would be interesting, though.
<Dken2021> it sounds like an ok episode t odo if they have no plans for more seasons
<DaringDerpy> afaik, they have plans
<Lil_B> I want one ever sicne I saw a a perticular picture... wait
<AJIsAwesome> If MLP: FIM does end, I hope they would do 5 minute shorts like they did with Foster's.
<Cades[Phone]> anybody here?
<TheMonstaMuffin> Yo yo yo!
<AJIsAwesome> *If the main series ends*
<Cynder7> 6I am but I have to go now.. >.<
<DaringDerpy> the show is a major success. there is no reason to end it before it gets bad
<drf|work> back
<drf|work> so I drive by this truck that advertises "we clean anything"
<AJIsAwesome> DaringDerpy: I know that. I'm just saying when it does.
<drf|work> one of the things listed is "crime scenes"
<DaringDerpy> g5 is a risk...new team, new concept, everything can go wrong.
<Meanwhile> Hello everyone.
<prince-dari> menwhirl
<drf|work> I am half tempted to call them up and be like "so I've got this dead body, can you help?"
<Dken2021> ello Meanwhile

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Meanwhile :)
<Applejack2011> good evening
<PillowPoni> Hey Meanwhile
<AJIsAwesome> Suddenly prince-dari
<Lil_B> or not, Deviantart doesn't want to, it basicly was a georgous pictureof Twilight going back to Ponywill, looking like a princess and seeing the aces of the others in the sky, and a grown up spike
<Lil_B> Ahoi Meanwhile
<prince-dari> AJIsAwesome: Accually is menwhirl
<Dken2021> well, sorta notice cartoon shows tend to be lackluster after 4 or 5 seasons
<Meanwhile> Suppose I should add that to my pings.
<prince-dari> XD
<TheMonstaMuffin> Anybody wanna party=
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: I meant that you could have popped up before, it seems like you've just been stalking the chat. :D

<Chrysalis> omg
<Tiara> hia
<Lil_B> Dken2021 I know, but it would still be a growing challenge to make creative well-written episodes after you already made so many
<Lil_B> hi Tiara
<Dken2021> ello Tiara
<Cynder7> 6See ya..
<Applejack2011> hiu
<Applejack2011> hi
<Lil_B> btw... has anyone here already played Borderlands 2?

<PillowPoni> Hello Tiara
<Lil_B> they made a Arrow(Bullet) to the Knee Joke ...
<Meanwhile> an*
<Tiara> :)
<Lil_B> an*
<Serenity> In the knee*
*PillowPoni doesn't have any of the cool games except TF2 because money
<AJIsAwesome> Isn't that joke already overused?
<Lil_B> Serenity the meme say to the knee
<Serenity> The quote says in the knee
<Lil_B> says "to the knee" *
<Applejack2011> just as old as Fluttertree jokes
<Lil_B> wait a sec... why do I even care how the quote actually goes?
<MadSurge> Lil_B: but I heard there's a guy that talks a lot about... horses :D
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome thats the point, and they still made that joke -.-
<AJIsAwesome> :I
<Applejack2011> horse jokes :D
<Lil_B> MadSurge I also heard another thing, but I had to find the video and the point in the video again to find it :/
<Serenity> Jesus
<Dken2021> it's like beating a ...hey!
<AJIsAwesome> What?
<prince-dari> I heard there's a guy who will make your horse into glue and canned dog food for good money.
<Serenity> My old laptop has an AMD Turion processor single core
<AJIsAwesome> :(
<Meanwhile> Mfw the Tesco down the road already has Christmas stuff out.
<alexxm> really Meanwhile this soon
<AJIsAwesome> >September already?
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: really? :D
<prince-dari> Fucking Tesco
<AJIsAwesome> >Cue Christmas Music
<PillowPoni> Meanwhile: Cinderblock them and demand they put out the Halloween shit
<Meanwhile> Yup. That's a record I think, usually they have it out on Halloween.
<MadSurge> It's still Halloween time!
<Applejack2011> our mall has Xmas decoration for sale now :D
<Dken2021> I've seen christmas lights out at october once
<PillowPoni> They already started the Layaway for Christmas stuffs at Walmart over here.
<AJIsAwesome> CHristmas lights in September. :D
<Serenity> Tesco are so early
<Lil_B> Meanwhile yerah, I was i a small supermarked today they already have the christmas candy :(
<Serenity> Always are
<MadSurge> Lil_B: candy has no season :D
<PillowPoni> No....
<AJIsAwesome> I always buy a crap ton of candy corn and scarf it down. :D
<Serenity> Actually, MadSurge, candy canes are usually Chrimbo themed
<Lil_B> MadSurge but when it says it on the box and the box is christmas themed?
<alexxm> why is this stuff coming out sooner every year
<PillowPoni> The Walmart where I live and the one 5 minutes from school had winter coats and jackets on the shelves.
<Serenity> But don't forget, Christmas is commercialised as fuck nowadays
<MadSurge> Lil_B: that might be the case :D
<PillowPoni> THE VERY LAST WEEK OF FUCKING AUGUST
<Lil_B> alexxm "We got to have... money" - owner of the shop
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 CHristmas stuff in July :D
<XylemTube> Is anything streaming right now, or did my browser crash again?
<Dken2021> don't think so
<alexxm> no stream
<prince-dari> Don't think anyone has streamed since Phase this morning
<MadSurge> Serenity: candy canes? It's been a million years since I had something like that or a giant lollipop :Q
<Lil_B> "Buy your kid a gift gif so it has a gift to give you next christmas" ... actually I think I should sell that line...
<MadSurge> prince-dari: yep
<Serenity> I had a giant lolly the other week at Scotland, but haven't had a candy cane in years
<Applejack2011> unusual quiet stream today
<Applejack2011> and halfdead chat
<MadSurge> Applejack2011: well, no stream means no sound :D
<Applejack2011> :D

<MadSurge> I HAD THIS BOOK
<Viri> 14O.O
<PillowPoni> Catepillar <3
<LilB> Dken2021 I recently found a My little Pony Maker from 2009 which actually was really realy good in my opinion
<alexxm> oh i just read the book as a kid
<Viri> 14did they steal anything?
*Dken2021 clutches stomach "ow, right in the childhood"
<drf|work> Yes
<PillowPoni> MadSurge: I KNOW, RIGHT?
<drf|work> like $5000 worth of TVs
<drf|work> http://i.imgur.com/O6LE9 <- I'm jelly
<LilB> I must have "read" this book a thousand times XD
<MadSurge> PillowPoni: Applejack's favorite book :D
<LilB> MadSurge /)
<PillowPoni> MadSurge: I know, right?
<Viri> 14ouch
<XylemTube> Are we ever gonna get to watch some Pingu?
<Viri> 14I hope nobody was around :/
<MadSurge> LilB: (\
<drf|work> nope
<Skylands> http://i.imgur.com/CIr19.png
<drf|work> otherwise we probably would have stopped them
<drf|work> the security camera shows like two guys wearing hoodies
<Lil_B> ok, that feels better
<prince-dari> >YFW I already streamed Pingu
<prince-dari> The ep where he gets a nosebleed
<Kjakings> 7Ladies, Gentlemen. SR.
<Rainbow_Dash_Rocks> What in Celestia is THIS?! 6_9
<MadSurge> I'd like to watch some Drawn Together :D
<PillowPoni> What's Pingu?
<XylemTube> prince-dari: :'(
<prince-dari> >not heard of Pingu
<alexxm> it turned out to be an eldritch abomintation and ate everything in the world
<Lil_B> Rainbow_Dash_Rocks the Childhood of various people
<drf|work> http://i.imgur.com/LPZQf.jpg <- I found this funnier than I should have
<AJIsAwesome_> PillowPoni: :O
<PillowPoni> MadSurge: I don't think they'd show that on stream. But then again we watch South Park here so....
<MadSurge> Rainbow_Dash_Rocks: the Hungry Caterpillar!
<MadSurge> PillowPoni: that's my reasoning
<XylemTube> prince-dari: when did you stream Pingu?
<Serenity> I remember this
<prince-dari> Ages ago
<Dken2021> Rainbow_Dash_Rocks have you not read books when you where little?
<Serenity> Damn, the years have flown by
<PillowPoni> AJIsAwesome_: What is Pingu? I don't think I've seen it.....
<MadSurge> Mmm all this fruit
<Serenity> It's a babies show about a penguin
<Serenity> It is cracking
<XylemTube> prince-dari: so dose this mean we're going to get to watch it soon?
<PillowPoni> MadSurge: True but DT is a little more vulgar than South Park....
<prince-dari> Hmm
<prince-dari> Mebbe
<AJIsAwesome> I AM THE CHEESE
<alexxm> cupcake
<prince-dari> PillowPoni: Scoots streams Boondocks
<prince-dari> Is it worse than that?
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: I AM THE BEST CHARACTER ON THE SHOW
<AJIsAwesome> I AM THE BEST CHARACTER ON THE SHOW
<PillowPoni> I've never seen Pingu. I don't remember hearing about it, either *braces pitchforks*
<Dken2021> prince-dari a bit
<alexxm> i watched pingu as a kid
<AJIsAwesome> I AM BETTER THAN THE BOLOGNA AND THE SALAMI COMBINED!
<PillowPoni> prince-dari: It's a bit worse than South Park and Boondocks combined....
<Serenity> Boondocks isn't that bad
<Serenity> Compared to some of the stuff out there
<Dken2021> compared to boondocks, it makes boondocks look like lucky stars
<MadSurge> And then he became a butterfly :3
<PillowPoni> prince-dari: Imagine a cartoon reality show with spoofs of well-known characters of TV shows living together in one house.
<Lil_B> I hope I'm there when scoots streams the second Pokemon Movie
<MadSurge> Lil_B: too late
<Princess_Cadence> wow the stram works finally
<Serenity> Scootaloo: Buuuuterflaaaaiii
<PillowPoni> prince-dari: One of them is a necrophiliac, one is a racist princess, one is a SpongeBob-lookalike...thing....

<Dark__Horst> tumbleweeds. THEY'RE REAL
<DocSane> I just need to figure out how to do it.
<Dken2021> aww, it;s a tumbleweed couple <3
<DocSane> Only catch is that it wouldn't have its own IRC channel, so if we wanted to chat, we'd probably have to open up the stream in a another tab while using this chat channel to talk.

<Cades> why isn't it showing the picture?
<Chrysalis> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/17/Z-d83MTbKkuCao1UPfua9A2.jpg

<Deadlypon3> V/H/S Sounds aweeeesooooooooooomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
<Kimori> can you post it one more time for my phone :]
<flutter_spin> I don't know. I'm very sensitive on horror.
<Reikim> Or you know what, I'll review this fic that got dumped in chat.
<Pikachu> Hi bronies/ponies! :)
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: Are you still working on it?
<BladedWings> hi Pikachu
<Cades> http://mobcup.in/content/wallpaprr/gvXxI5jDjQojf1VaPf6EXPDOsUHAfYvSA04gnp1G8pHxrWlKYdo+F5sXF+5S8d7aT5xuogJJskaiAfi8u46Evs9jtGhf3pldr0AuY3ZV0MpO7mHhR2Vld5RpmkkdT3igNNHuqzF+6TdGV+LiLkhV1i0cGWHgSkBGEGBDxX85XFKt0VWH7Dw~awaar0xK~nQfWQFmUw~5o+ZM0XTI5e56RA==
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Pikachu! :)
<sub06905> ello Pikachu
<FlutterDash> someone getting brutally murded, or gutted, isnt horror.
<Jim> Have fun, hope it's a good one.
<flutter_spin> AJIsAwesome: the oneshot is complete. I just submitted it
<thelonepony> hi Pikachu
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: Okay.
<Deadlypon3> Let's see here...Itunes classics...
<Reikim> Hm
<Deadlypon3> 'Splice' Aliens Vs. PRedator.
<Pikachu> PLease dont tell me you were watching 'Cupcakes' I am totally scared of that
<FlutterDash> Cupcakes is tame
<Deadlypon3> The Thing
<flutter_spin> Cupcakes is... tame?
<FlutterDash> yeah
<Reikim> It's far less painful than the grammatically-challenged messes I usually end up with.
<flutter_spin> Not to me.
<FlutterDash> also, it wasnt even a good fic
<FlutterDash> its badly written
<BladedWings> careful guys
<Deadlypon3> Childs Play
<Reikim> Really, compared to the last thing I decided to force myself to read, the rampant abuse of a thesaurus is almost pleasant..
<Pikachu> i like my little dashie\
<flutter_spin> I don't even like Bubbles
<FlutterDash> My Little Dashie bored me
<Deadlypon3> THEM!
<Kimori> got it
<FlutterDash> Bubbles was sad
<Deadlypon3> THE earth Dies SCreaming!
<Deadlypon3> Here's a classic: Laserblast
<FlutterDash> i think ive heard of Laserblast
<flutter_spin> At one time, even Starcraft scared me
<Deadlypon3> Mst3k
<Dark__Horst> depends on what version of cupcakes
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Becomin' Popularrr
<Dark__Horst> there were several revisions
<FlutterDash> dude, i read A Fun Day, Cheerilee's Garden, Cupcakes, Rarity's New Dress, Sweet Apple Massacre, etc, and did not get disturbed
<Dark__Horst> some just hopelessy overdid the gore
<DarkLugia> Drf
<Dark__Horst> but the last one i read (quite a while ago. a long while was actually pretty good
<FlutterDash> which is
<DarkLugia> You know what my dog does when he misses me? He just runs out the door and pees everywhere .-.
<flutter_spin> Can't tell if you are proud of not being disturbed
<MadSurge> Okies guy, gotta go to bed now. See you tomorrow!
<Nittany_Discord> SAM disturbed me.
<Dark__Horst> sweet apple massacre was just a typical case of "tried too hard"
<flutter_spin> hey Nit
<Reikim> Nitt, if it didn't, I would be disturbed by /you/
<Nittany_Discord> Hey flutter_spin.
<drf|work> so does ours
<Nittany_Discord> Cupcakes didn't.
<FlutterDash> SAM was bad, but a funny bad
<drf|work> but only when it's my mom
<drf|work> she hates all the rest of us LOL
<Nittany_Discord> Cheerilee's Garden didn't.
<Deadlypon3> What's that movie with the japanese gal who climbs out of the TV/
<flutter_spin> I didn't like SAM
<flutter_spin> Ring?
<Deadlypon3> Oh yeaaaah
<flutter_spin> That was too disturbing
<Caramel> 2,14 and we're live folks
<FlutterDash> SAM was hilarious
<Deadlypon3> HUZZAAAH
<Dark92Enigma> FlutterDash: what is SAM? (Cue song)
<Reikim> The first of those...okay, admittedly, Cupcakes probably just gets annoying after a while. The second? I'm not even going to ask, Nitt.
<Caramel> 2,14 this video represents today's theme for the stream
<Reikim> Which is?
<BladedWings> there we go...stream!
<FlutterDash> and yes, im proud that nothing disturbs me
<Ryunosuke> spiderman
<Ryunosuke> ?
<BladedWings> i think i know
<FlutterDash> Sweet Apple Massacre
<AJIsAwesome> SUDDENLY STREAM
<Dark92Enigma> SPIDERMAN DOES WHAT HE WANTS
<Reikim> Oh, yes.

<Cades> have you seen this one http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/063/3/0/Spyro_and_Cynder_Wallpaper_by_Tsitra360.jpg
<Reikim> Val once again demonstrates all of the fucks he gives for chat's whining.
<AJIsAwesome> FlutterDash: Song from the video?
<drf|work> http://imgur.com/GKZco.jpg
<drf|work> OMG
<Nittany_Discord> There are cupcakes sequels worse than the original.
<PillowPoni|Sims3> Sudently
<drf|work> not sure if GIANT dog, tiny baby, or both
<Chrysalis> oh this vid :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh hey
<weeping_pegasi82> I was watching tobuscus play slender and then this started playing at the perfect time I thought it was the video
<Jim> 0
<CrimsonPhoenix> that now overplayed video
<Reikim> Precisely. And I approve.
<Bronysith> and i smell Caramel
*Bronysith glomps Chrysalis
<Kimori> thats pretty awesome
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: why is laguna so awesome?
<Kimori> But I guess that wallpaper isnt public?
<Chrysalis> Bronysith because ff8
<FlutterDash> someone said "whats SAM?(Cue Song)"
<Chrysalis> you cannot ignore its girth
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm sensing german
<Caramel> 2,14 bronysith: BECAUSE GREATEST ATTACK EVER!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, aren't cupcakes sequels basically tryhards of the original?
<flutter_spin> For some reason, I instantly thought Rammstein
<FlutterDash> Cupcakes was a tryhard as well
<Cades> no it is, its just a zip file because there's a bunch of different sizes and colors
<CrimsonPhoenix> FlutterDash, good point
<Chrysalis> Luna be best pony
<BladedWings> flutter_spin: same
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<weeping_pegasi82> Luna is best princess
<FlutterDash> Cheerilee's Garden was really good though
<BladedWings> nite GilDash
<Nittany_Discord> Some are.
<thelonepony> night GilDash
<Bronysith> Caramel: well i still need to play more ff8
<PillowPoni|Sims3> Night GilDash

<CrimsonPhoenix> I enjoy Rainbow Factory myself
<Chrysalis> 'night GilDash
<FlutterDash> night GilDash
<FlutterDash> havent read Rainbow Factory. well, i read a riff fic on it
<AJIsAwesome> Night, GilDash :)
<sub06905> night GilDash
<flutter_spin> I don't know whether to watch this, watch Dr. Who, play Starcraft 2, or write some more of my story. No, I will not do all at once.
<weeping_pegasi82> it looks like a bass octavia is playing but I've been told it was a cello I'm confused
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutter_spin, where are you on Dr Who?
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: Yes.
<flutter_spin> I watched Season 6, went back and watched Season 5. I watched the first episodes of Season 1
<FlutterDash> season 1 or the first series?
<CrimsonPhoenix> woah wait wha
<flutter_spin> of the 9th doctor
<sub06905> fluffy pony
<CrimsonPhoenix> so you started on 11th doctor?
<flutter_spin> yes
<flutter_spin> I watched all of 11th doctor
<BladedWings> awww yea batman!!
<FlutterDash> cause there was docters 1-8, then 9-11
<CrimsonPhoenix> dude that's like.....
<CrimsonPhoenix> why
<weeping_pegasi82> no way
<weeping_pegasi82> yes!
<Cades> http://tsitra360.deviantart.com/art/Spyro-and-Cynder-Wallpaper-156180624 its there if you want it
<sub06905> needs more adam west
<BladedWings> lol derpy
<flutter_spin> lol no no no no. Doctors 1-8 is not on my todo list
<CrimsonPhoenix> I started at 9th to 10
<CrimsonPhoenix> haven't watched 11 yet
<FlutterDash> why not
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I'm thinking on watching the oldies
<CrimsonPhoenix> before 11
<FlutterDash> if youre a fan of a series, you should know where the series came from
<flutter_spin> Well you are a curious person. I would rather read all of Lord of the Rings books before watching Doctors 1-8
<Kimori> ty
<AJIsAwesome> But some of the old episodes are lost, right?
<doctor_whooves127> batman!!!
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05im old enough to have watched this, yay
<flutter_spin> And trust me, those books were on my list for a long time
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutter_spin, who's the most important companion?
<AJIsAwesome> Same here.
<flutter_spin> most important? Well the only ones I really know are Amy & Rory
<FlutterDash> so, you wont even give the old docters a chance, because theyre old?
<Ryunosuke> because, police blimps
<flutter_spin> I have to draw the line somewhere.
<Cades> np
<FlutterDash> thats a shallow reason
<doctor_whooves127> oh manbat ep cool
<Ryunosuke> every doctor has thier plusses and minuses
<CrimsonPhoenix> I believe Sarah Jane Smith is THE most iconic companion
<Ryunosuke> SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY
<Adjeca> awesome thanks
<AJIsAwesome> BE THERE
<FlutterDash> ive never watched Docter Who. if i decide to start, ill start from First Docter
<Ryunosuke> so
<flutter_spin> Look. I have been dying to see the 9th and 10th doctor. A special episode suddenly wants me to see the 5th doctor.
<Dark__Horst> whats on sunday?
<Ryunosuke> we have a VA, playing a rent-a-cop, wanting to be a VA
<Bronysith> FlutterDash: have fun finding old episodes
<Ryunosuke> how ironic
<CrimsonPhoenix> FlutterDash, to be honest I'll say it's safe to start on 9th
<flutter_spin> But no, I don't have 'all the time in the world' to do everything
<Dark92Enigma> wait............is this............BATMAN?
<Ryunosuke> Dark92Enigma, yes
<AJIsAwesome> >Giant bat
<FlutterDash> nah. i wanna start from the beginning
<weeping_pegasi82> no the manbat
<Dark92Enigma> We're past the intro, right?
<AJIsAwesome> >Obviously Batman
<flutter_spin> Do you know how many episodes there are before the reboot?
<CrimsonPhoenix> FlutterDash, enjoy you're missing episodes
<Cades> anytime :P
<Bronysith> 2 face?
<Bronysith> CrimsonPhoenix: *your
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronysith, thank you
<FlutterDash> im awae that theres alot of episodes befoe the reoot
<CrimsonPhoenix> I hate that common mistake
<FlutterDash> reboot*
<weeping_pegasi82> flutter_spin: I heard there were over ten seasons
<flutter_spin> I've also heard that there are missing episodes of the 1st & 2nd
<Dark92Enigma> i was in the bathroom, and when i got back, i'm watching this!
<FlutterDash> aware*
<Dark92Enigma> YESYESYESYES
<CrimsonPhoenix> most of 2nd
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/s3KJK.png
<Soital> 12!pokemon
<CrimsonPhoenix> and 1st only in season 4
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 3Haxorus.
<doctor_whooves127> lol alfred
<flutter_spin> weeping_pegasi82: yeah. When I looked at it, I just wanted to settle with the 11th doctor. Then, slowly, I wanted to see the 9th & 10th
<flutter_spin> If anything, it was for the episode: "Blink"
<FlutterDash> as i said, i like to start from the beginning
<Jim> Tennant is best doctor
<weeping_pegasi82> Jim: I agree
<flutter_spin> Tennant is the 10th doctor, correct? Jim, I hear that from everyone
<Dark92Enigma> I looked at the first Story-arc of Dr. Who.........from then onwards, i carried on
<sub06905> yup
<Jim> yeah, he's #10
<flutter_spin> HELLO
<BladedWings> oh my
<CrimsonPhoenix> I say that Christopher is better
<Ryunosuke> dr who is like MLP, everyone has thier favorite doctor for different reasaons
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, mai............
<Dark92Enigma> HE'S BATMAN
<weeping_pegasi82> oh old cartoons
<Dark92Enigma> Oh myyyyyyyy
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's just that 10th had more exposure thus he's more popular
<CK|Catnap> mfw turn on stream and BATMAN
<flutter_spin> Right now, I dislike the 9th doctor. I find him kind of cold.
<weeping_pegasi82> and he was funnier
<weeping_pegasi82> flutter_spin: don't worry he warms up to you
<CK|Catnap> WHO IS STREAMING, AND WHERE CAN I SEND MY HUGS
<CK|Catnap> :D
<AJIsAwesome> CK|Catnap: Caramel IS.
<flutter_spin> weeping_pegasi82: I hope so.
<Dark92Enigma> flutter_spin: kinda like.......emo?
<CrimsonPhoenix> 9th had great xpression
<CrimsonPhoenix> expression**
<Shibaru> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lelhg6hPm41qb9lkbo1_400.jpg
<Dark92Enigma> CK|Catnap: Caramel
<Shibaru> I can't read this D:
<CK|Catnap> All the hugs, Caramel. ALL OF THEM. :3
<flutter_spin> Dark92Enigma: hmm. Not exactly. Just seems a little cold-hearted, cruel perhaps? not caring.
<Dark92Enigma> i don't think the 9th doctor was that bad
<Ryunosuke> i myself like Jon Pertwee as a favorite myself
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I love the 9th when he gets all serious or raging
<Ryunosuke> 3rd doctor
<FlutterDash> though thees this webcomic called Homestuck, thats over 6000 pages, and still going. a few of my friends are really into it, and have told me again and again to read it. i will, someday
<FlutterDash> theres
<CK|Catnap> A microscopic twig!
<Kimori> hmmm
<Skylands> !puellamagi
<weeping_pegasi82> the 9th doctor's grin is just ear to ear!
<CK|Catnap> Jinkies!
<CrimsonPhoenix> FlutterDash, DON'T
<BlueFlare> Skylands, you are 121Homura Akemi.
<Kimori> Its been so many years since Ive read music
<Cades> I don't either, but I think it's safe to assume it's an insult of some kind :p
<Nick> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Nick, you are a 14Leavanny.
<Kimori> I like that its original
<FlutterDash> why not
<CK|Catnap> ....LOL, they actually have that "hut-hut-hut" sound?
<Cades> same haha
<Shibaru> I wanna know what it says ;__; xD
<BlueFlare> 12hai Nick :3
<CK|Catnap> That's like golden stereotype
<CrimsonPhoenix> Homestuck is horrible
<Nick> hi blueflare!
<CrimsonPhoenix> and overshadows a lot of MSPA comics
<Cades> I have to find out what it means now :p
<flutter_spin> Our designated dishwasher would tell stories of proper Navy & Marine procedures
<flutter_spin> like which people say 'hoorah'
<FlutterDash> as i said, i might read it someday. though that means ill most likely never read it
<weeping_pegasi82> batmans got to be pretty strong to pull apart elevator doors, that's usually a two man job
<CK|Catnap> That's an empty threat, just go ahead and call them off yourself, Gordon.
<FlutterDash> 6,000 pages is alot
<Meanwhile> Herp derp.
<CK|Catnap> ....
<flutter_spin> coooooool
<weeping_pegasi82> you idiot
<CK|Catnap> Tear gas, now with explodium
<Meanwhile> Way to consider where you are, highly trained professional.
<weeping_pegasi82> tear gas sets off certain chemicals that's why you never use it on a meth lab
<flutter_spin> lol bat exhibit
<Ryunosuke> QUESTION
<Dark92Enigma> If i'm NOT wrong..........this show is on THE HUB right?
<Cades> You wanna know what it says? :p
<FlutterDash> what exactly IS Homestuck about?
<Kimori> yeah
<Ryunosuke> Why does BATMAN, need to learn about BATS
<Shibaru> Yes 8)
<Kimori> I wont kick you if its a bad word :P
<Cades> You are a babe :p
<Ryunosuke> I thought he knew a lot about bats as it was
<Shibaru> xD
<Cades> lol
<flutter_spin> He reminds me of the penguin
<Kimori> lol
<Adjeca> haha
<Cades> Where'd you find it lol
<Shibaru> I got a comment from Mike but no notification DAMMIT DEVIANTART!!!
<flutter_spin> ah yeah
<FlutterDash> and ill most likely not watch Doctor Who either. theres other shows to watch
<flutter_spin> lol.
<CK|Catnap> Wayne is good at pretending to be dumb.
<Dark92Enigma> again, i'll ask: this show is on The Hub, right?
<flutter_spin> O.o
<flutter_spin> and that does not worry you?
<weeping_pegasi82> interesting noise
<FlutterDash> lik,e ever watch Madoka Magica?
<flutter_spin> I don't know if it is on the Hub. They might have the other Batman show.
<Meanwhile> Yeah, no bat makes a noise like that.
<CK|Catnap> Dat burn, Alfred
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: More Shirts at Welovefine
<Dark92Enigma> weeping_pegasi82: i heard it in Disney's Hercules
<Dark__Horst> ...fuck you alfred. fuck you
<Shibaru> http://shibaruryu.deviantart.com/ lookit the comments... xD
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Yes.
<Dark92Enigma> What's Up Doc?
<CK|Catnap> Dark__Horst: Umad bro? Alfred be trollin
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<flutter_spin> lol
<flutter_spin> I'm confused. Is his batman voice more natural?
<Kencolt> Ah... This one. The first episode ever to be broadcast.
<FlutterDash_> Madoka Magica is the typical magical girl anime, but is very different from the others
<FlutterDash_> cant say cause spoilers
<FlutterDash_> ken, first episode of what
<flutter_spin> dc issue, FD?
<Kencolt> Batman, the animated series.
<Dark92Enigma> flutter_spin: All the Batman shows i know are: THIS ONE <-- Batman Beyond, The Batman reboot, and the Brave and Bold...........the hub mentions Batman: The Animated Series
<FlutterDash_> ah. and yeah, server crapped out.
<flutter_spin> lol. I hate when that happens
<Cades> lol at demonik
<FlutterDash_> Batman the Animated Series. ive seen one episode, which was Baby Doll. dark stuff.
<cachi01|phone> Hi everypony=D
<Dark92Enigma> FlutterDash_ It's kinda hard, because you can't tell if it's the beginning, so i can't tell you ''WELL DUH''
<weeping_pegasi82> hey cachi01|phone
<doctor_whooves127> so the lizard as a bat?
<BladedWings> hi cachi01|phone

<Dark92Enigma> cachi01|phone: guess what's on the stream?
<Cades> uhhh no :P
<flutter_spin> Well Dark92Enigma, I guess it is. I don't pay attention to what is on the Hub. If there is a show I like, I watch just the one show
<cachi01|phone> hi weeping_pegasi82 BladedWings Dark92Enigma and AJIsAwesome :)
<Cades> dammit shibaru
<cachi01|phone> Dark92Enigma, mmmmmm batman?
<thelonepony> hi cachi01|phone

<Obsidian> Hey guys Im ba- HOLY CRAP are we watching Batman TAS?
<Buytoast> ah, the dark knight rises
<BladedWings> Obsidian: eeyup
<Reikim2> Blech, all these EQD links.
<flutter_spin> The ghost is speaking to us. It says ooooooooo
<Dark92Enigma> flutter_spin: we-know-who!........IF I WOULD have the Hub in my country, i would watch this show again
<Deadlypon3> THE Cooommiiishiner
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeaaaaaaaad.
<Reikim> Trick me into thinking this room is anything but dead.
<Dark92Enigma> cachi01|phone: the ANIMATED SERIES
<Nittany_Discord> The ghost is speaking. It says *explodes*
<cachi01|phone> BATMAN TAS? BRB GETTING ICE CREAM AND TURNING PS3 ON!
<Reikim> There we are.
<flutter_spin> Dark92Enigma: aw. I've seen this on several other channels.
<Shibaru> She was that other person on that join.me that one time when I was playing LSD XD
<FlutterDash_> heres the basic premise. This girl named Madoka, and her friend Sayaka are approached by this creature called Kyube, who says that if they make a contract ith him, they ecome magical girls, and he grants them one wish.
<Dark92Enigma> DA COMMISSIONER!!!!!
<Deadlypon3> Gaahahahahahh!
<FlutterDash_> with*
<flutter_spin> Its one of those shows that sneak in every now and then
<Dark92Enigma> flutter_spin: i can't tell.....i'm not in the US
<Obsidian> I loved this show as a kid
<Cades> demonik or shadow?
<Shibaru> demonik
<Cades> haha
<flutter_spin> I believe it aired on Cartoon Network for some time
<EspyLacopa|2> lol, becomin' popularrr
<FlutterDash_> bthere. thats the basic premise
<CK|Catnap> Derp
<Dark92Enigma> HOLY----
<cachi01|phone> cartoon network, fox kids and WBkids
<weeping_pegasi82> blood
<Dark92Enigma> DED
<flutter_spin> yeah. WB. I don't get WB
<Cades> Yeah i remember her
<Meanwhile> Alfred gives no fucks.
<flutter_spin> I had to watch... um, Xmen Kids whatever on the Internet. Stupid WB
<cachi01|phone> alfred never gives a fuck
<Obsidian> ALfred sees giant bat. Asks if it wants dinner.
<CK|Catnap> He's too classy to give fucks
<Dark92Enigma> WB does not broadcast things like this anymore in my country..........
<Dark92Enigma> WHY?
<CK|Catnap> >Will he change again?
<CK|Catnap> >It's over....for now
<Obsidian> No spoilers
<Dark92Enigma> EPIC
<Meanwhile> I think the implication was that he could do it again if he wanted to
<Dark92Enigma> Simply epic
<FlutterDash_> Madoka Magica is a really good show. that simple premise actually gets expanded upon
<cachi01|phone> i have a batman vs predator comic and alfred is so badass in it
<flutter_spin> haha. Batmare
<Kencolt> B:tAS is shown on the HUB, these days.
<Dark92Enigma> Here we go again
<AJIsAwesome> "batmare" :D
<CK|Catnap> I think that was what they were going for, Meanwhile, it just sorta feels awkward. XD
<weeping_pegasi82> cachi01|phone: I have that one
<Dark92Enigma> Batmare :D
<flutter_spin> I now miss Darkwing Duck
<cachi01|phone> brb
<Shibaru> :3
<Meanwhile> Yeah I get what you mean Critic, it's a bit..."what?"
<Dark92Enigma> Caramel next time play Batman feat. Nostalgia Critic
<weeping_pegasi82> if only that episode wasn't so uhhhhhh... how do I say it?
<CK|Catnap> Dat lightning
<AJIsAwesome> Dat lightning. :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> now for the overplayed episode
<weeping_pegasi82> bad, maybe?
<Cades> I love tortelini so much I don't even know how to spell it
<weeping_pegasi82> boom
<Dark92Enigma> BOOM
<CK|Catnap> Batman TAS, overplayed? NONSENSE.
<CK|Catnap> This show cannot ever be overplayed.
<CrimsonPhoenix> CK|Catnap, not the show I mean episode
*Dark92Enigma Batman says: I'm gonna kick your aaaaaaaaasssssssssss
<CK|Catnap> Nevar.
<KandARRRRRRRRRRRRihu> Arr, more Batman!
*Dark92Enigma i'm gonna stand hereeeeeeee aaaand POOOOOOOSE
<CrimsonPhoenix> yep
<Deadlypon3> Huzzzah
<CrimsonPhoenix> THAT episode
<Dark92Enigma> LAWL
<CK|Catnap> Yay Joker!
<CK|Catnap> :D
<weeping_pegasi82> KandARRRRRRRRRRRRihu: you name is too long
<CrimsonPhoenix> JIngle bells
<CrimsonPhoenix> Batman Smells
<CK|Catnap> Mark Hamill is best Joker/pony
<CrimsonPhoenix> Robin layed an egg
<weeping_pegasi82> mark hamill!!!
<KandARRRRRRRRRRRRihu> weeping_pegasi82, autocomplete be your friend, matey!
<Spitfire> wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Deadlypon3> Wweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Obsidian> Joker is a man of his word
<Dark92Enigma> Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<doctor_whooves127> batmans in the kitchen robins in the hall jokers in the bathroom peeing on the walls
<Deadlypon3> Except Yoooouuuu :(
<Deadlypon3> XD
<Caramel> 2,14 I nominate Mark Hamill for one of the top 5 VAs of all time
<CrimsonPhoenix> Caramel, agreed
<Deadlypon3> "Could never get past the title; could never imagine how anyone could have a wonderful life"
<CrimsonPhoenix> maybe even top 1
<weeping_pegasi82> agreed
<Bronysith> Caramel: he is also luke skywalker
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tabitha being /2
<CK|Catnap> Agreed
<CrimsonPhoenix> #2**
<FlutterDash> i heard the version of Dark Knight Rises they showed in Colorado was the directors cut.it had 12 shots not in the original
<weeping_pegasi82> Bronysith: everyone knows that
<Deadlypon3> FlutterDash no it didn't
<FlutterDash> no, its a joke. 12 shots. 12 people died
<Kencolt> FlutterDash: HORRIBLE.
<Caramel> 2,14 Bronysith: already knew that
<Obsidian> Spreading the friendship
<Deadlypon3> ...And thats....awful
<Meanwhile> >No use for Batman on Christmas.
<Deadlypon3> That is a truly awful thing to say
<CK|Catnap> Mark Hamill is just so damn good. And he's been in a lot of great stuff, too. Voice of Batman TAS's Joker, played the lead role in Wing Commander....
<Caramel> 2,14 I only say top 5 because it's near impossible to say who's the best ever
<Meanwhile> >Christmas eve is one of the worst nights of the year for casualties and stealing
<FlutterDash> whats REALLY awful is that those people never saw the end of the movie
<Caramel> 2,14 I mean, there's Tabitha and Tara to consider :P
<Cades> Anybody know how to use torrents?
<Deadlypon3> "Relentelessy Cheerful -3-?"
<Shibaru> Nope
<Dark92Enigma> Caramel: Don't forget Jim Cummings
<Meanwhile> Critic: Firelord Ozai.
<Shibaru> Ask Mike 8)
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm sorry but Tabitha is clearly superior to Tara
<Princess_Cadence> more oldschool cartoons?
<Kimori> I use to use it a long time ago
<Bronysith> Tara Strong is my fav voice actress...
<CK|Catnap> Instead, we has JOKER TROLLING
<FlutterDash> Comedy is Comedy. no matter how offensive it is
<Panda|Hibernating> CrimsonPhoenix Tabith is best VA :)
<Buytoast> it's true
<weeping_pegasi82> joker you troll
<Buytoast> comedy is comedy
<Kencolt> This is hardly oldschool.
<Obsidian> But we are watching Batman. :P
<Dark92Enigma> Joker is a TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
<Cades> http://leteckaposta.cz/387348817
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kencolt, hasn't this show been in the 90s?
<Dark92Enigma> TITLE DROP!
<CrimsonPhoenix> we're in the 10's now
<doctor_whooves127> i think frank welker wins just check his imdb page
<Cades> Apparently this is a really rare wallpaper
<weeping_pegasi82> that sweater
<Kencolt> CrimsonPhoenix: I'm in my mid-fiffties. As far as I am concerned, this is far from old school.
<AJIsAwesome> Depends on your definition of old school.
<Dark92Enigma> 2ND TITLE DRO
<Dark92Enigma> ´DROP*
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kencolt, oh dear
<Dark92Enigma> You can tell the crowd is acting all wooden!
<Kencolt> Hitting 55 come november.
<Dark92Enigma> :D
<Dark92Enigma> get it?
<FlutterDash> Fourteen people shot dead at Dark Knight Rises premier? Here's betting at least one of the orphans becomes the real Batman.
<CK|Catnap> Dem cutouts
<weeping_pegasi82> *facehoof*
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Boo............
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat laugh track
<Dark92Enigma> :| Everyone's a critic
<JESmith71> FlutterDash: Double boo
<CK|Catnap> >can't spit out the candy cane gag
<jojoyasmin> Wow this is the best website I've found...
<CK|Catnap> >nothing holding it in
*AJIsAwesome pats Dark92Enigma "It's okay."
<Deadlypon3> Man, Joker's voice sounds wayyyy different
<FlutterDash> A gunman has opened fire at a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises" in Colorado killing 12 people and injuring 50 others. What saddens me the most is that why couldn't he prepare to wait another 4 months for a screening of Twilight: Breaking Dawn....
<Dark92Enigma> FlutterDash: and i thought my joke was lame......that's no laughing matter
<CrimsonPhoenix> jojoyasmin, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2637/
<doctor_whooves127> its really tasty i guess
<JESmith71> Deadlypon3: Probably because of Hamill getting older
<Deadlypon3> Flutterdash Do Not joke about it
<Obsidian> THats enough FlutterDash
<Meanwhile> FlutterDash: I lold.
<Dark92Enigma> FlutterDash: you're getting a ban
<jojoyasmin> Haha wow
<Deadlypon3> JESmith71 he has voiced it for YEARS; He doesn't sound different even in the last year Arkham
<weeping_pegasi82> wow

<FlutterDash> ban for telling jokes?
<FlutterDash> ok then
<Meanwhile> Ah leave him alone you crybabies.
<Kencolt> Joker. Brilliant homicidal madman. Worst ventriloquist ever.
<Deadlypon3> Flutterdash Not when you live in colorado
<JESmith71> Well you said he sounded different
<FlutterDash> hey, as i said. comedy is comedy
<CK|Catnap> Dat song
<Deadlypon3> Flutterdash no it's NOT
<Dark92Enigma> FlutterDash: No......ban for joking with a TERRIBLE INCIDENT THAT IS NOT LAUGHING MATTER
<weeping_pegasi82> that's were it came from
<VenHur> Ooh, Batman.
<JESmith71> Hey you could say that's Joker's right hand mand
<Dark92Enigma> dat song :D
<JESmith71> man
<Dark92Enigma> JESmith71: lawl
<Cades> WHAT?!?!!?
<FlutterDash> hey, i make jokes about stuff like that all the time
<Dark92Enigma> SEE, THAT'S A FUNNY JOKE
<CrimsonPhoenix> FlutterDash, you haven't been banned
<Cades> download it right now :p
<Kimori> WAIT
<CK|Catnap> UR MOM
<JESmith71> I'm suprised that didn't use that joke in the real episode
<Kimori> You should be real careful if its an actual program
<jojoyasmin> Oh noes! Her mommy!
<Dark92Enigma> YOUR MOMMA
<Deadlypon3> Flutterdash then your an awful person. let's just drop it...

<Deadlypon3> I take it seriously.
<FlutterDash> cool. youre lucky you didnt go to that showing
<Dark92Enigma> I still have this little Batman action figure based on this series.........and proud of it......
<Adjeca> seems to run fine in WINE, pretty neat
<Deadlypon3> Flutterdash just drop it
<Nittany_Discord> EqD used Wrek's pirate Rarity picture for that "Becoming Popularrr" post. Nice.
<CK|Catnap> THOMAS NOOOOOOOO

<VenHur> Nowadays, I only watch TV for The 90s Are All That, Toonami, and Ponies...
<Obsidian> AJIsAwesome: Adam West actually did a guest voice for an episode of this show
<AJIsAwesome> He did?
<Dark92Enigma> Oh no........POP goes the crowd!
<jojoyasmin> Crap, stopped watching for a little and turned to train explosions
<AJIsAwesome> Cool.
<Deadlypon3> Yeah :O
<Dark92Enigma> get it?
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: .............
<JESmith71> AJIsAwesome: I was introduced to Batman through Adam West. I think before the Keaton film came out Family Channel started playing the West Batman
<Kimori> Its a program like Microsoft Windows
<CK|Catnap> Dat face
<Jim> ooh, neat
<Dark92Enigma> OH SHIT!
<FlutterDash> and a few family members of his died in9/11 as well. if he can take a joke, why cant thou?
<JESmith71> AJIsAwesome: Yeah West played the Grey Ghost
<Adjeca> program for linux to run windows programs using non proprietary methods :)
<Cades> oh ok
<Meanwhile> http://derpy.me/es3Vd
<Kimori> Is the screensaver actually decent?
<CK|Catnap> ....
<CK|Catnap> Mortar
<Cades> I think so :p
<CK|Catnap> He turned an observatory into a bloody mortar cannon
<VenHur> Oh yeah, and that block for the 90s Cartoon Network cartoons...forgot what it called...

<Obsidian> Shizuka: D'aaaaaaw

<AJIsAwesome> It's so sweet and disturbing at the same time. :D
<CK|Catnap> Machine gun fingers.
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: no, that's new.
<Deadlypon3> ...couldn't yah just crawl under them?
<JESmith71> Though that wasn't a block it was a show
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: That was added months ago.
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: when i do a lame joke, i tell johnny (the piano man) to play the following clip (cue PM)
<CK|Catnap> For when your machine guns aren't inaccurate or impractical enough
<VenHur> Oh yeah, Cartoon Planet...that block camed back, but Space Ghost didn't comed back.
<JESmith71> AJIsAwesome: It's not new, it's a revival of an old show

<CK|Catnap> Bewm
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: It is? I thought all they did was air old cartoons.
<weeping_pegasi82> BOOM
<FlutterDash> The suspect being held for the Dark Knight Rises killings in Colorado is almost certainly going to be found guilty for his terrible crime... ...I guess that rules out him being member of the Metropolitan Police
<VenHur> That block has some Cartoon Cartoons from the 90s.

<CrimsonPhoenix> XylemTube, many times
<AJIsAwesome> XylemTube: Yeah, a couple weeks ago.
<Deadlypon3> It has a giant clown face on it; so it is obviously a hideout for joker.
<FlutterDash> XD nice one
<XylemTube> Great episode here
<JESmith71> Sumi ran it recently after the Batman film played
<pirate_sprinkle> Bronysith: i think youll be delighted to know that bieber is going to do a cover of stairway to heaven
<Nick> what do you mean lati?
<Kencolt> Referencing Betty Boop, a true oldschool cartoon character of the 30's.
<Deadlypon3> Joker is so happy :P

<XylemTube> prince-dari: i'm still looking forward to some Pingu...
<Dark92Enigma> NUTCRACKER!!!!!!
<prince-dari> I probably can't stream again today
<Deadlypon3> Dark92Enigma Batman should destroy any building with a clown face on it
<CrimsonPhoenix> pirate_sprinkle, You must be trolling
<jojoyasmin> Time to dance
<Bronysith> pirate_sprinkle: okay there is trolling, then there is going way too far
<pirate_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: unfortunately im not. apparently raping hey jude and let it be wasnt enought
<weeping_pegasi82> holy nutcracker batman!

<XylemTube> Snoipahs?

<Meanwhile> What was the last thing to go through Mr Jone's head while he was working on the 90th floor of the WTC?
<pirate_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i believe so. i know i saw him butcher hey jude on crhistmas, ive also heard that he covered let it be
<Meanwhile> the 91st floor.
<CK|Catnap> Shizuka: That is so me. :D Okay, so it's not, but being a kitty I could totally see me doing that.
<pirate_sprinkle> Derpy_Hooves: its a figure of speech and neither is it a joke
<VenHur> Nickelodeon has The 90s are All That. Cartoon Network has Cartoon Planet.
<Deadlypon3> "I Love you Berry much"
<CK|Catnap> ....Pedobear
<AJIsAwesome> pirate_sprinkle: ..........................this doesn't even deserve a facehoof.
<Dark92Enigma> BEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAR
<XylemTube> nice to see that saftey is a priority here
<VenHur> As for Disney...well, nothing...
<FlutterDash> How is eucharist like a dick? You get them both shoved down your throat by a priest.
<Bronysith> pirate_sprinkle: stairway to heaven is sacred territory, not even the greatest bands in the world are allowed to cover that
<Meanwhile> Hah.
<CK|Catnap> And....
<CK|Catnap> LOL
<JESmith71> VenHur: Yeah it sucks they took away the old school stuff from Toon Disney
<pirate_sprinkle> Bronysith: well let it be was sacred territory too
<weeping_pegasi82> :D
<prince-dari> Dat Lambduh
<Dken2021> I don't get the joke
<Dark__Horst> if that had been poison, he
<Dark92Enigma> POW right in the kisser
<CK|Catnap> No one expects the Pie Inquisition
<Dark__Horst> 'd be dead
<prince-dari> Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong time no see
<prince-dari> :P
<Adjeca> i sure can
<CK|Catnap> LOL
<Dark92Enigma> POINTLESS....................but fun
<jojoyasmin> XD
<Dken2021> careless as ever
<Dark__Horst> DROP HIM!
<Bronysith> pirate_sprinkle: but this is stairway to heaven, the greatest rock song ever
<VenHur> Thanks god this amazing cartoon is on The Hub.
<XylemTube> that sure was nice of the batman
<Dark92Enigma> VenHur: I knew it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Baah hum bug
<FlutterDash> Christianity: One woman's lie about having an affair that got seriously out of hand.
<Dken2021> VenHur and also batman beyond
<CK|Catnap> Why would you ever need fake arms like that anyways? XD
<Nick> I mena more specifically what happened?
<Bronysith> pirate_sprinkle: no one should cover classic rock...like, ever
<CK|Catnap> It's so one-use it's hilarious
<Bronysith> EVER
<Deadlypon3> CK Catnap Caaause it's joker
<Caramel> 2,14 alright flutterdash, you've had your fun
<Bronysith> NEVER COVER CLASSIC ROCK
<Caramel> 2,14 now knock it off
<Meanwhile> FlutterDash: Hahaha
<Obsidian> CK|Catnap: Dont questions the Joker's methods
<CK|Catnap> ....his eyes clearly just derped in the middle of that
<XylemTube> VenHur: indeed. i gotta say i've been quite impressed with the hub latley.
<CK|Catnap> Did you see that?
<Meanwhile> Aww c'mon Val that's his best one yet.
<jojoyasmin> ALFRED
<Caramel> 2,14 and I've tolerated it more than I should have
<pirate_sprinkle> Bronysith: well ive heard hes going to. might as well buy your pitchforks
<Ponies47> Hey everypony! :)

<weeping_pegasi82> guys knock it off he's showing Batman for pete's sake!
<FlutterDash_> fine. why do cannibals prefer to eat emos? cause they come pre-sliced
<VenHur> XylemTube: Tell me about it, I mean, Frangle Rock?! Two Batmans for the price of one?! A GOOD My Little Pony Cartoon?!
<Derpy_Hooves> kick one its all in the mind
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Ponies47 :)
<weeping_pegasi82> hey Ponies47
<Kencolt> WHY dress Sweetie Belle up like Chibi-Moon?
<FlutterDash_> Arguing with a Christian is like playing chess with a pigeon. You could be the greatest player in the world, but the pigeon will still knock over all the pieces, shit on the board and strut around triumphantly.
<Soital> 12I bought a small figure on ebay
<VenHur> XylemTube: The Hub is probally the only good thing to watch on TV nowadays, and I hoped they keep it that way!
<Soital> 1227th august seller said they sent it 30th august
<Dken2021> Kencolt because japanese themed remix
<Ponies47> Who is streaming? O.O
<Phase4> 00,02guys: https://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=14107 'IE Zero Day is "For Real"'
<Deadlypon3> "EYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"
<Soital> 12I've had stuff from Japan, USA etc
<weeping_pegasi82> FlutterDash: knock it off
<Soital> 12this was in the UK
<Phase4> 00,02basically if you use ie right now your computer will be owned
<Soital> 12and it STILL hasn't arrived, sent two messages no responce
<XylemTube> FlutterDash_: lame copy-paste
<Dken2021> oh dear, those poor people who still use IE
<Meanwhile> Ah well, he didn't listen.
<Meanwhile> Still funny though.
<VenHur> Chuck Norris did that perfect run...without pressing anything.
<XylemTube> YUS
<Phase4> 00,02BATMAN
<pirate_sprinkle> Phase4: oh i read about that today lol. i kinda feel sorry for microsoft screwing up IE again
<Jim> dat ban
<Soital> 12ebay you'd think would be more trusting I guess...the community I bought 90% of stuff would be less than eBay I'd say ;w;
<BladedWings> Meanwhile: that emo joke ws kinda funny lol
<BladedWings> *was
<Phase4> 00,02pirate_sprinkle, it was pre-screwed, the hackers just pointed it out
<VenHur> Opening Credits...in a nutshell: "I'm Batman, god damn it!"
<Soital> 12but nope LOL
*Dark92Enigma i'm gonna kick your aaaaaaaaas
<Dark92Enigma> ass*
<Dark__Horst> Phase4: good thing i dont use IE
<Dken2021> VenHur and if you noticed where it was twi DJ, he messed up the perfect, and then it was brought back
<Phase4> 00,02pirate_sprinkle, it actually effects every version of ie >= 6 (possibly earlier but no one tests)
*Dark92Enigma i'm gonna stand heeeeere aaand poooooose
<BladedWings> oooo, scarecrow!
<CK|Catnap> Scarecrow ep? :D
<Jim> wait, people use IE?
<Phase4> 00,02Jim, people do, its wierd
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, boy! Scarecrow! :D
<Jim> I thought it was just a bad joke from Microsoft
<pirate_sprinkle> Phase4: oh, i thought it was just the last one. daamn, they don fuqed up :S
<weeping_pegasi82> what happened with IE?
<Jim> Viruses happened
<VenHur> Now peoples, I know this may sounds crazy, but I never readt a comic book...
<weeping_pegasi82> when?
<Nick> the seller probably sent it cheapest option possible heh
<Jim> but, well, that always was a problem with IE
<Jim> last week, and it's still going on
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: That's alright. I'm not really a person who reads comics.
<Dark__Horst> Phase4: what exactly does this thing do?
<VenHur> So I may not know some of the lesser known Batman villains...
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm using it right now...
<Soital> 12Probably but they said "1st class" on their shipping thing >__>
<Dark__Horst> ...that'S not how you reload a tommyy gun
<pirate_sprinkle> funny, i was actually willing to give the new IE a shot cause i felt bad for them, guess thats out of the question
<Jim> I'd suggest changing to Mozilla Firefox or Chrome
<Phase4> 00,02Dark__Horst, 'use after free' bug, basically they can crash ie. its possible to extend the bug and run code remotely
<Soital> 12still, they should at least communicate with me
<Soital> 12they're not even doing that
<VenHur> Like Scarecrow, like Mr. Freeze...or Poison Ivy...or that clay guy...
<Nick> ah right
<Dark__Horst> that might be bad
<Soital> 12I'm giving them 3-5 more days
<Joy> Hi everyone!
<Nick> maybe they haven't sent it then
<Soital> 12give them negative feedback
<CK|Catnap> ....wow
<Jim> Hi Joy
<Meanwhile> Wow, that guy was angry.
<BladedWings> hi Joy
<weeping_pegasi82> hey Joy
<VenHur> But I do know the Joker, The Penguin, and Harly Quinn.
<pirate_sprinkle> hoi Joy
<Soital> 12and somehow a refund
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Joy! :)
<CK|Catnap> Dick move, man
<Joy> :)
<BladedWings> VenHur: what about Two-Face?
<Soital> 12Probably not...but they said they had because they "dispatched" it on 30th
<Meanwhile> "If your dead dad was alive, he'd have died from shame"
<thelonepony> hi jojoyasmin
<Nick> I dunno but maybe try contacting ebay first before leaving feedback
<DocSane> "Good thing your dad's dead, because he'd die of shame over you, Bruce!"
<Deadlypon3> Tiny TOONS :O
<Soital> 12and I HATE when people lie about sending stuff early
<VenHur> Oh yeah, fucking Two-Face is awesome!
<AJIsAwesome> DAT TINY TOON ADVENTURES REFERENCE
<pirate_sprinkle> huhuhu *boom*
<Soital> 12What would I say to them?
<Dark92Enigma> TINY TOONS!
<CrimsonPhoenix> VenHur, Riddler? Lesser known?
<Deadlypon3> Scarecrow :O
<Nick> they can retaliate and leave you neg feedback too and it can harm you
<Soital> 12I've never had this problem before LOL
<CK|Catnap> His parents were gunned down in front of him, how about toning down the "father would be ashamed" crap, Mr Old Fart, kthx.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bithc please
<thelonepony> Hi Joy
<Soital> 12true
<Dark__Horst> sometimes i wonder if some of the guys on the show worked on fallout too
<Dark92Enigma> Of course, it's WARNER
<Phase4> 00,02if his dad was alive there would be no batman
<VenHur> Oh yeah, the Riddler...
<Dark__Horst> with all that retro-futuristic style
<XylemTube> Oh shit
<Dark92Enigma> VenHur: remember Two Face?
<XylemTube> it's this villian
<Nick> Not sure but I'm sure there's the paypal disputes and ebay could temp ban his account
<Dark92Enigma> SCARECROOOOOOOOOW
<Meanwhile> Scarecrow.
<Soital> 12I'd be okay if the seller was all "I'm really sorry...I'm away for 2 weeks I'll send it then"
<weeping_pegasi82> scarecrow
<Soital> 12but noo
<Dark92Enigma> R2D2 WHERE ARE YOU?
<Meanwhile> Awackawhat.
<Phase4> 00,02LEARNING
<CrimsonPhoenix> Scarecrow is pretty cool
<Dark92Enigma> ARACNO-PHOBIA
<VenHur> I remember Two Face, his two faces (no pun intended) freaks me out in The Dark Knight...
<Soital> 12he has 100% positive feedback as well
<Soital> 12=/
<Kencolt> A point-- with few exceptions almost every one of Batman's main villains is at least partly a lunatic. Probably the most sane one is the Penguin-- who may be odd looking, but never dives into the crazy like most of the pack.
<AJIsAwesome> He reminds me of the Boogeyman from Billy and Mandy. :D
<Phase4> 00,02now you know what aracnophobia is
<Soital> 12How do you do a dispute? ;w;
<XylemTube> but i already knew what it was
<AJIsAwesome> AND NOW YOU KNOW
<Nick> 100 positive feedback really?
<Dark92Enigma> And learing is half the battle
<Soital> 12Yep =/
<pirate_sprinkle> the more you know~
<AJIsAwesome> Thundercats!
<Dark92Enigma> (cue G.I. joe theme)
<Nick> Then try contacting them again then try getting ebay to contact them if you can
<Dark__Horst> yes, becasue a bit of gasoline in a STEEL VAULT will do so much damage
<Soital> 12At first I thought he sent it in an envelope and it got lost but...
<Obsidian> I really liked Scarecrow's re-design in Batman Arkham Asylum
<XylemTube> lol- a gasmask
<Soital> 12no communication from them makes me ponder
<VenHur> If The Hub got this and Batman Beyond, why not the Stephen Speilburg cartoons?
<Nick> if they have a perfect feedback there's probably a good reason maybe
<Soital> 12I'm not sure how I'd go about making eBay contact them o.o
<VenHur> I'm just saying.
<Meanwhile> Because scarecrows are scary.
<Nick> there will be a way I'm sure
<Nick> if not ebay then paypal
<XylemTube> ohhh you touch my tra la la
<Dken2021> oh this be the first appearance of scarecrow
<Dark92Enigma> VenHur: legit question........warner copyrights, perhaps?
<VenHur> My favorite Two-Face moment: "Look at us...we're all freaks. And who made us this way? BATMAN!"
<Joy> :)
<VenHur> Dark92Enigma: Yeah, could be.
<Dken2021> not his father
<Meanwhile> Bruuuuce, I am disappooooiiiiiiint
<XylemTube> poor batman :'(
<Dark92Enigma> FATHER
<Dark92Enigma> :'(
<AJIsAwesome> Dark__Horst: As did I.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah batman nice
<XylemTube> if only it was luke in there
<Dark__Horst> awesome revenge plan, scarecrow. pouring some gasoline IN A STEEL VAULT with a SPRINKLER SYSTEM
<Soital> 12ooh theres this resolve a problem thing
<Soital> 12okay
<Dark__Horst> AJIsAwesome: wat?
<Soital> 12I'll give them a day or so to reply to my message today
<Soital> 12then I'm going to do that
<Dken2021> wait, why did he try to torch a bank?
<Nittany_Discord> What if he put gas in the sprinkler system?
<AJIsAwesome> Dark__Horst: Scarecrow's redesign.
<Nick> ok
<Dark__Horst> AJIsAwesome: what about it?
<Soital> 12I gave them nearly 1 and a half weeks to reply to my first message
<pirate_sprinkle> sprinkle system?
<Nick> actually their feedback maybe 100 percent positive but how many neutrals do they have?
<Obsidian> AJIsAwesome: It was me that said that
<VenHur> How did he escape? Because HE'S BATMAN!
<Dark92Enigma> Dark__Horst: WASN'T that supossed to liven the fire instead of putting it down?
<AJIsAwesome> Whoops. :4
<AJIsAwesome> *:$
<Deadlypon3> Nittany_Discord Sprinkers don't work that way
<Soital> 12It says everything is positive
<Nittany_Discord> You can make them work that way with enough gas.
<AJIsAwesome> Ouch..........
<Obsidian> Backstory Time
<Meanwhile> Lunatic.
<pirate_sprinkle> nice guy
<Dark__Horst> Dark92Enigma: i dont think sprinkler systems normally liven fire, no
<weeping_pegasi82> lunatic!
<Soital> 12I'm wondering if I go to the post office...maybe they'd somehow tell me if they sent it or not?
<Dark92Enigma> Y-Y-Y-Y-You're Crazy!
<Soital> 12I'm not sure if they can tell o.o;
<Kencolt> Told you.
<Dark__Horst> Dark92Enigma: oh wait, you were joking. people confuse me tonight
<AJIsAwesome> Boogeyman could learn a lesson from this guy.
<Deadlypon3> DISCO!
<Dken2021> mmmm, million dollars
<Deadlypon3> Batman has a rave :D
<Dark__Horst> AJIsAwesome: and i still dont know what you're trying to tell me
<Soital> 12It MIGHT have got lost, it's really small
<Meanwhile> Needs a batshave.

<Bronysith> that is evil
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<AJIsAwesome> That is why this is my favorite Joker.
<weeping_pegasi82> wow
<Skylands> 10Soital, how long ago did you buy those big Latis?
<Bronysith> he is just fucking psycho
<Bronysith> best joker
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Soital> 12I'd say about a month ago
<Dken2021> Puns!
<VenHur> Mark is the best Joker, hands down!
<Skylands> 10on eBay?
<VenHur> ...Err, HOOFS down!
<Soital> 12I remember when they were all over eBay and I was late in getting them, fortunately a seller had them
<Soital> 12yeah :3
<Bronysith> you aint lyra VenHur
<Skylands> 10I can't find them atm
<Soital> 12I was pretty late getting them >_<
<Dark92Enigma> He is funny and psychotic, hooves down. Mark Hamill is best animated Joker.........
<Soital> 12and they were originally sold seperately, sometimes together
<VenHur> ^
<Kencolt> He's especially good in the Batman Beyondmovie (the good version, not the broadcast "softened" version.)
<XylemTube> LASERS
<VenHur> PG-13 version, he meant.
<Dark92Enigma> have you ever heard the saying: ''If it's not broken, don't fix it?'' that's pretty much my guess with the other ''versions'' of the Joker in the different versions of Batman
<Bronysith> playing dirty is the only way to play
<drfsupercenter> 03also how do you determine what to call bootleg? Companies like Tomy aren't licensed by Nintendo either...
<XylemTube> moar puns
<Dark92Enigma> animated Batman*
<Soital> 12They're officially sold though
<drfsupercenter> 03so what's wrong with Some Guy In His Basement, Inc. ?

<CrimsonPhoenix> Dken2021, you can install data in hardward for faster reading

<Sumica> 00,10if you feel like it's too easy up the difaculty
<weeping_pegasi82> that voice sounds familiar
<Bronysith> oh hey there Sumica
<weeping_pegasi82> the warden's
<CrimsonPhoenix> I remember when I stream I had alot of comment about my deaths in video game
<Reikim> On the other hand, watching Batman get repeatedly murdered would be amusing for at least five minutes.
<Buytoast> it's mr herriman
*Bronysith glompels into Sumica s kneecaps
<VenHur> weeping_pegasi82: Two words. Mark Hamill.
<CrimsonPhoenix> so much I got used to it and laugh with the audience
<CrimsonPhoenix> or joke about it
<Freefall29> CrimsonPhoenix: what did you stream
<Buytoast> and shit like that
<Sumica> 00,10owwww, careful
<CrimsonPhoenix> Freefall29, tons of stuff
<GabeMoist> Dose Batman have a plan for this?
<weeping_pegasi82> THE WARDEN'S VOICE WHAT IS THE WARDEN'S VOICE FROM???
<Raspberry> hello everypony!
<Dken2021> he's batman, of course he does
<Mozdoc> The lighting and atmosphere of this game is fantastic.
<Freefall29> CrimsonPhoenix: what kind of tons of stuff...
<Dken2021> hai Raspberry
<Nyst> Man, this intro is still amazing. Such a good introduction for new people and comic fans alike.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Raspberry
<CrimsonPhoenix> Games
<thelonepony> hi Raspberry
<Reikim> weeping_pegasi82: Mark Hamill. He played Luke Skywalker.
<DerpyMuffins> Caramel doing a Batman walkthrough?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Various games
<weeping_pegasi82> hey Raspberry
<thelonepony> eeyup
<CrimsonPhoenix> mostly single-player
<CrimsonPhoenix> possibly most of them were Nintendo games but yeah
<Buytoast> The Warden sounds like Mr. herriman from Foster's. That's all Irecognize it from off the bat
<GabeMoist> Nananananana Batman
<VenHur> Reikim: NO WAY! I never knew that!
<Reikim> VenHur: Someone else said it, not me.
<thelonepony> http://derpibooru.org/56456?scope=scpee797e8c7c16183d62da95919900ca5c09c6b09e0
<Reikim> CP: You ever play Touhou? Because those give plenty of amusing deaths.
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.epubor.com/remove-ibooks-drm-read-ibooks-on-pc.html
<weeping_pegasi82> thelonepony: lol
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<CK|Catnap> I love Mark Hamill's work in this
<GabeMoist> Reikim, playing Touhou is like standing in the rain without getting wet
<Starchaser> guys i got commando today
<Reikim> Aw, it's not THAT bad.
<Soital> 12...
<Starchaser> the arnie movie
<Reikim> Once you get over your first...hundred deaths?
<Soital> 12looking at some auctions
<Ponies47> Joker!
<Soital> 12says in the delivery they post worldwide
<Reikim> And as long as you can deal with BS like Eirin's Last Spell.
<Soital> 12then in the description
<Soital> 12NO INTERNATIONAL BIDDERS
<GabeMoist> Reikim, the farthest I got was up to Remilia in EoSD Normal
<Soital> 12WTF
<Freefall29> Reikim: makes perfect sense they didn't release it in america
<Nick> LOL
<Reikim> Actually ZUN's just lazy.
<Dken2021> hello steve blum
<Nick> yeah thats stupid
<Reikim> And that's impressive, Gabe.
<Nick> anyway off to bed night all
<Soital> 12Night Nick!
<VenHur> Oh, that's just DIRTY!
<Reikim> Especially EoSD, that's easily the hardest PC Touhou
<GabeMoist> But that was a while ago, so I wouldn't be able to do it again without a lot of practice
<pirate_sprinkle> how old is this game?
<Reikim> Ha, same.
<Reikim> I haven't play MoF in over a year.
<Buytoast> 3-4 years old maybe
<VenHur> Probally 3 to 4 years...maybe 5...
<pirate_sprinkle> wow, looks good for such an old game
<Reikim> My friend, on the other hand, has played enough MoF that he is quite literally incapable of playing anything below Lunatic.
<Dken2021> still pretty impressive
<GabeMoist> Reikim, Oh yeah, I did get up Kanoko is MoF
<Freefall29> killer croc, I don't think they use him much these days.
<Raspberry> only fluttershy can tame this guy!
<CK|Catnap> OH GOD
<Ponies47> O.O
*CK|Catnap whimpers and hides under his blanket.
<Freefall29> Raspberry: I have my doubts. that monster has no soul.
<Derpy_Hooves> for all of those who have never played this game, your in for an AWESOME stream :D
<VenHur> I haven't...
<Sumica> 00,10I threw a rock at him
*Ponies47 Hugs CK|Catnap "It will be ok"
<Dken2021> I like how the wheels aren't animated
<Bronysith> Derpy_Hooves: *you're
<Wirisme> I haven't either
<VenHur> Sumica: A ROCK?!
<Dken2021> Sumica -_-
<Raspberry> if it isnt a pony, fluttershy can tame it
<Bronysith> Sumica: why did you throw a rock at me?
<Sumica> 00,10it was a big rock
<Derpy_Hooves> Sumica you throw rocks at everything D:
<Ponies47> Sumica: Dumb rock!
<VenHur> ...Tom strikes again...
<Derpy_Hooves> Bronysith: don't correct my grammer :I
<Derpy_Hooves> grammar*
<GabeMoist> The best way to practice Touhou is to practice on Lunatic
<pirate_sprinkle> it wasnt a rock.... it was a boulder!
<pirate_sprinkle> *make All the references*
<Jim> but it wasn't a rock...it was a..rock lobster!
<Bronysith> Jim: ROCK LOBSTER?!
<Jim> ROCK LOBSTER!
<Bronysith> rock lobster?
<Jim> rock.
<Jim> lobster.
<Freefall29> I saw it on the beach.

<Freefall29> idiots. you NEVER go anyways with the joker unless you have a gun

<flutter_spin> If every site, EQD, DHN, Wiki, has not splattered the release date.. I don't trust it
<SushiKitten> hii
<Buytoast> i hope you didn't actually believe that
<Buytoast> man
<MasterBrony> NOOOOO
<Dken2021> well since it's a shorter season, it might debut later than the other seasons
<Obsidian> MakerDusk: and now you got Shizu drinking again
<Buytoast> oh this is wonderful
<Sumica> 00,10hell yeah I am gonna stream the premear this saterday, I love family game night

<CrimsonPhoenix> MasterBrony, you're quite a twat
<Freefall29> that troll was a fantastic troll.... even a major site like EQD fell for it.
<Meanwhile> I find it more depressing than anything.
<VenHur> Sumica: So do I, Sumica...
<Buytoast> you actually listened to other people?
<AJIsAwesome> MasterBrony: Why? :S
<Buytoast> rather than verify for yourself?
<ASoftFluffyThing> If it doesn't come directly from the Hub, I don't believe it
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> Freefall29, not really fantastic
<Moopy> YEAH TOAST!

<Jim> You should learn how to say "Go to hell" in such a way that they will look forward to the journey.

<junh1024-XD> Africa and Hold The Line, I will be excited if we get those
<DJ_POn-3> gaaahhh im wearing headphones now my left ear hurts :D :(
<Shizuka> 13why is rosie the robot taunting batman?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03what about it
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not there yet
<Reikim> "Take a trip to the scenic Underworld! Marvel at the crimson landscapes! Dance gaily among the bitter flames! Gift shop open 24/7; buy a souvenir!"
<junh1024-XD> iduno
<Meanwhile> Because she's a bitch.
<Freefall29> Shizuka: who is harley quinns voice actress?
<junh1024-XD> Africa is on a 5.1 SACD
<drfsupercenter> 03supposedly "coming soon"
<Jim> Perfect
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<drfsupercenter> 03is it?
<DJ_POn-3> the old fashioned way (being batman)
<Sumica> 00,10funny thing Shizuka her boss is also knowen as Mr J
<drfsupercenter> 03is it like, actual multitrack though or just LOL blended instruments
<CPTBarbetos> o_o
<Freefall29> she said that in the animated series
<VenHur> Freefall29: I don't remember the name of the actress, but she's the Animated Series one.
<junh1024-XD> probably blended but you could probably use FFT based imagers to separate it out
<drfsupercenter> 03far too lazy to do that
<Freefall29> batman: the animated series reference... thats is awesome
<junh1024-XD> yes, it is effort.
<Shizuka> 13and now jane jetson is in on it
<drfsupercenter> 03but you wanna try to do that FFT stuff on some Jammit tracks to make an "alternate instruments" track for me?
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 no
<drfsupercenter> 03I have guitar, drums, bass, vocals
<scout19_tf2> hey yo wuts up everypony:)
<JESmith71> Freefall29: VenHur : Arleen Sorkin
<Dken2021> sup scout19_tf2
<drfsupercenter> 03and then "all but drums", "all but guitar" etc
<Obsidian> Hello scout19_tf2
<thelonepony> hi scout19_tf2
<Ponies47> Hey scout19_tf2. Nothing much
<drfsupercenter> 03somehow there's a way to ascertain the missing stuff
<Freefall29> scout19_tf2: /)
<Shizuka> 13shizu freemane needed a grappling hook .-.
<Reikim> So anyway, rephrase: is there a nice, polite way of saying "this is stupid, you are stupid, and I'm going to go somewhere else to be less stupid"?
<VenHur> Howdy ho scout19_tf2!
<junh1024-XD> keep in mind it won't always work
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<DJ_POn-3> this is arkham asylum right?
<drfsupercenter> 03usually they just use phase inversion
<Dken2021> yup
<junh1024-XD> and CCX in A3/4 probably best quality
<drfsupercenter> 03but there might be a better way?
<BlueFlare> 12!Shipping
<Skylands> 4 BlueFlare is paired with drfsupercenter
<VenHur> DJ_POn-3: Yup.
<drfsupercenter> 03NO
<BlueFlare> 12:|
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway brb
<scout19_tf2> and wut r we watching today
<DJ_POn-3> Arlham city is funner and more funny
<Jim> Try constructive criticism
<Meanwhile> Because this is mentally incompetant.
<VenHur> Arkham Asylum.
<GabeMoist> The Jetsons are responsible for this!?
<BlueFlare> 12XD
<BlueFlare> 12seeya
<junh1024-XD> i have used QQMT, and it's great if QQMT is enough quality, because it's quite a visual and intuitive way to do it
<Ryunosuke> so Harley likes B-man and Mr. J
<BlueFlare> 12!Shipping
<Skylands> 4 BlueFlare is paired with prince-lemon
<Ryunosuke> I know where THAT is going
<Shizuka> 13so when do we get back to desmond
<Meanwhile> Or how about
<junh1024-XD> but if you can't get enouigh quality then you needa go A, which is like, numbers and sliders
<Shizuka> 13this is assassins creed right
<Freefall29> Ryunosuke: harley likes anybody who smacks her around.
<XAX> Shizuka: Place a laser mine on the ground and jump over it to clear a few gaps or walls (if you have above 70 health .-.)
<Meanwhile> Because this could only ever exist in your deluded fanboy brain and would never be physically plausible.
<Ryunosuke> nonono
<Ryunosuke> you completely missed it :)

<DerpyMuffins> Batman just a troll
<Bronysith> pirate_sprinkle: she only had 1 episode that people remember her for, and the other one isnt really applejack cause derpy talked in it and now no one remembers what applejack did that episode
<Sumica> 00,10dose !cd count as asking?
<Obsidian> I say yes
<Freefall29> Bronysith: I remember applejack... I liked that episode
<Meanwhile> Gotham really needs to impliment the death penalty.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I LOVE these tapes
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: ending to arkham city was good
<Meanwhile> I mean, they have electric chairs in there. Are they just for show or what?
<Obsidian> Yes he is
<pirate_sprinkle> Bronysith: well its not the riters fault if the fans dont have enough of an attention span to remember both aj and derpy from the ep
<Caramel> 2,14 arkham city sucked. I will only play it unless chat overwhelmingly demands it
<Bronysith> pirate_sprinkle: it is the writers fault however to give one time characters their own songs before applejack
<Obsidian> inb4 everyone requests arkham city
<Jim> Speaking of Batman http://i.imgur.com/B9pTB.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> Woah
<VenHur> Arkham City! Arkham City! Arkham City! ...There, UHAPPY?
<CPTBarbetos> That joker be playing that silly las like an accordion
<Freefall29> I hope they don't try to make twilight more important then she really is in season 3, such has all of a sudden she has a bro that is getting married to a princess.
<Sumica> 00,10it has tara, of corse they will demand it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Caramel, I'm actually curious why you think so

<thelonepony> is stream on for you guys?
<Chimera> Mahboi
<Ponies47> Stream go down?
<Meanwhile> Nope, mine borked.
<pirate_sprinkle> thelonepony: no, it died
<Bronysith> she is the least popular pony
<Eulshy> i thought there wasnt supposed to be S3 talk on here?
<Bronysith> ZUUL
<Obsidian> Stream is down here
<pirate_sprinkle> Bronysith: she will, i bet 100 bits on it
<Freefall29> Bronysith: they gave spike singing lines for crying out loud. thats a sign they gotta.
<PirateBarbetos> Narry a stream be in sight.
<Meanwhile> Eulshy: Nothing that constitutes a spoiler.
<pirate_sprinkle> Bronysith: the writers are perfectly aware that she doesnt have a song, im sure the over..enthuastic fans have pelted them with enough messages
<Eulshy> Other than the fact i now know spike has a singing part
<VenHur> I know he's getting Arkham City...I can FEEL it!
<Bronysith> pirate_sprinkle: they will give spike his own song before applejack, they will give everypony and their mother a song before applejack
<VenHur> A first for Spike.
<Bronysith> Eulshy: to be fair, that was Freefall29 who spoiled that
<Sumica> 00,10Caramel crashed by the look of it
<Meanwhile> Indeed, guess his internet died
<AJIsAwesome> yeah, that's what I thought.
<Ponies47> It happens
<Freefall29> Bronysith: that was a spoil?
<pirate_sprinkle> Bronysith: she'll have a song, i have nou doubt about it
<DJ_POn-3> why applejack sings amazingly
<Reikim> Remember when it used to be "blacked out"?
<GabeMoist> I thought my internet died
<DJ_POn-3> :'(
<Bronysith> DJ_POn-3: because no one likes applejack
<Bronysith> unfortunetley
<Reikim> And remember when they added the idiotic "Reikim rushed his pokemon to the centre, protecting them from further harm..."
<GabeMoist> applejack is best poni
<Bronysith> or however the fuck you spell that
<CCCP> hi
<DJ_POn-3> AJIsAwesome: isnt she awesome?

<VenHur> Tidus: HAH HA HAH HA H- Me: U SHADDAP!
<Reikim> Actually.
<Reikim> Oh I lost so much
<Reikim> Usually the Elite Four, especially after G2
<Freefall29> I think the guy has stopped streaming. not a derp, its not on
<VenHur> Sorry, I has to do that for a reason...
<Reikim> (cheating goddamn bastards want to choke them all)
<Meanwhile> Only played Gold.

<Jim> I played blue, red, yellow, gold, silver and crystal
<Obsidian> Freefall29: His internet crashed
<Jim> I did not have a gameshark
<Reikim> "Elite Four *x* used one FULL RESTORE!"
<weeping_pegasi82> yay I got it working without my computer freezing!
<Jim> still killed everything with my charizard
<Reikim> "Reikim tossed his GBA through the window!"
<Jim> but Dragonite was tha shizz

<Freefall29> ok.... so..... anypony got suggestions to bring chat, chatty again?
<Meanwhile> I recall having to reload a save before Lugia umpteen times because I kept knocking the schmuck out instead of catching it.
<Reikim> The worst part was that the evolved water starter in G4 sucks ass.

<Moopy> Hey Princess_Cadence you there?
<CountDoofus> Haio Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: i said goodbye last night, but stream was too fast to notice me
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: okay.
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: by the way, i'm watching ''A Dog and Pony show''
<AJIsAwesome> Cool.
<Dark92Enigma> lol dem Rarity eyes......''is there something wrong Spike?''
<Dark92Enigma> oh there come the Gollum Diamond Dogs
<Dark92Enigma> inb4 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<AJIsAwesome> Just to let you know, when I saw the episode for the first time I laughed incredibly hard when the shortest diamond dog tried to imitate Rarity's whining. :D
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: is it me, or they remind me of Scratch and Grounder?
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: I never thought of that.
*Dark92Enigma ''I thought you HAD it!''
<AJIsAwesome> Since there are three, I don't really think so.
<Dark92Enigma> No, the series saved it for Snips and Snails
<Dark92Enigma> they don't have the voices, but they are annoying
<Dark92Enigma> IMO
<AJIsAwesome> Chat is so active today.......... :D
<Gold_Demona> ikr?
<ReganSkool> D: an active chatroom
<Dark92Enigma> Hell, it had more activity during BATMAN TAS
<Dark92Enigma> No stream right? can i post a video?

<CountDoofus> kirzstryfe: The screencap I'm using wasn't pasted as a separate layer, and by moving it around it's all over the place. Halp?
<Lil_B> ALL of my yes! https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/19/TkReTUgOHkWUH0p1s9_IvQ2.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, : D
<ReganSkool> :3
<CountDoofus> Never mind.
<Lil_B> Phase4 Im so hope this is no fake
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, woah, if you had shown me that only a year ago i would probably have cringed
<Phase4> 00,02makes you think dont it
<Dark92Enigma> YOU WANNA HEAR WHINING? THIS IS WHINING!
<CountDoofus> Ohai Lil_B
<ReganSkool> I thought that read 2012 when I first saw it XD
<Lil_B> Phase4 me not, I know so many people how watched the Power Puff Girls as a kid, mostly Boys XD
<Lil_B> and yes, hi all XD
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: me included!
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, tbh i didnt see it until i was older
<Lil_B> thanks CountDoofus
<CountDoofus> Nugh, this harnass is too tight! It's going to chafe, can't you loosen it? Uh, it hurts, and IT'S SO RUSTY! Why didn't you clean it first? It's gonna leave a STAAAAAAIIIN! The wagon's getting heavy, why do I have to pull iiiiiit?!
<Phase4> 00,02old enough that society was trying to push me away from catoons, but not old enough to get the humor
<Dark92Enigma> and now the little diamond dog imitates her
<Dark92Enigma> You did not........
<Lil_B> Phase4 this was one of the only good shows people without Kable TV got to watch :)
<Dark92Enigma> call
<Dark92Enigma> her
<Dark92Enigma> mule
<Dark92Enigma> YOU DID NOT!
<CountDoofus> ^ Reminds me of The Room.
<Dark92Enigma> And now Rarity is looking at the 4th wall ''just look at me''
<Dark92Enigma> Oh hai CountDoofus!
<Sumica> 00,10oh hi all
<CountDoofus> Haio Dark92Enigma and Sumica :)
<Lil_B> hi thar Sumica
<Lil_B> hia Dark92Enigma :)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Sumica :)
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: I laughed incredibly hard when he imitated her. :D
<Sumica> 00,10So if I was to say pick up digimon would you all want US or JP version?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Morning Sumica
<ASoftFluffyThing> The movie or episodes?
<Lil_B> sooo Nintendo announces new Console for 2012 in E3 2011 ... Sony announces slimmer PS3 in Fall 2012
<kirzstryfe> depends on if we can read the subs Sumica :P
<Lil_B> Sumica japanese
<kirzstryfe> proof that WoW has gone to hell http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&list=PLIT_A6m1Gl-lkxt7meTbwIcHm2HTS37uq&v=TlpgMQkxcQY
<kirzstryfe> 25man heroic raid cleared with a single class
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'm used to the US version
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: I would probably say Japanese.
<Gold_Demona> Sumica: For me it'd depend on the series.
<Sumica> 00,10have you ever not been able to read them kirzstryfe?
<kirzstryfe> only when I'm trying to do other stuff too :P
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05kirzstryfe: well they used a priest adn shamym on spine to dispel
<Lil_B> Sumica I usually don't care about bad translations, but Digimon got a bed translations and a bad redone music
<kirzstryfe> you know it's still bad Wrek :P
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05plus at this point heroic has a -35% on all stats on the bosses
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05so its understadnable to how they managed
<Lil_B> I got a new Keyboard todasy, its mechanical, its rather heavy -.-
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05i call clever use of game mechanics
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05deathcoil to heal
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: IKR? Wah wah (shut up)
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05plus the self healf opf DK tanks
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05it adds up really
<kirzstryfe> don't get me wrong, I think it's cool that they managed to pull it off
<AJIsAwesome> ohai Serenity
<Serenity> Wrek|MLG-Sniper: Are you talking about the crazy rotation of a deathtank?
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: and the puns.....OMG the puns
<EspyLacopa|2> So many death knights. . .
<Sumica> 00,10not supprised at all it's all DK's
<EspyLacopa|2> That's hilarious.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, 0.17 is out
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I know
<EspyLacopa|2> Not sure why it's seen as proof that WoW has gone to hell.
<Phase4> 00,0214 bodies in the solar system
<Phase4> 00,02i've got work to do
<EspyLacopa|2> Other than the massive amount of dead people walking.
<Sumica> 00,10tryed telling you yesterday there was a patch coming
<Serenity> Phase4: Oopsee?
<kirzstryfe> clear an entire raid with a class designed for tank/dps
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah, aparently i didnt notice
<Phase4> 00,02ah well
<Serenity> Hey, kirzstryfe, hows life treating you?
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma I only heard the american version once actually (for opnce I praise the people who made the german dub for making it directly from the japanese original)
<Dark92Enigma> Sumica Japanese PLEASE! I grew up with the Latin American version, and it has the theme i love: ''Butterfly''
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah the all DK thing been doing that for ages
<kirzstryfe> DKs were not designed to handle being healers
<kirzstryfe> long work hours, don't have a day off until sunday >.<
<Barbetos|AtWork> >roll death knight. Tries to be healer of groups.
<Serenity> Monk <3
<Sumica> 00,10Dk's were realy a pita when they had the self rez
<Meanwhile> Hello everyone.
<Serenity> Sumica: Don't remind me
<Serenity> Hello, Meanwhile
<AJIsAwesome> ohai Meanwhile
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma yeah "Butterflkly" is an amazing song
<Barbetos|AtWork> Do DKs still have that corpse res thing?
*Lil_B hugs Meanwhile
<Serenity> Barbetos|AtWork: I beleive so
<Barbetos|AtWork> Zombie follower or whatever.
<Sumica> 00,10ok I will see if I can find adventure here today for future showing
<Serenity> But they nerfed the hell out of it
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05healign DK is somewhat viable apparently
<Meanwhile> Wait what?
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05yeah
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05specially with death coil
*Lil_B still can't play DK for unknown reasons
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 0518k absorbon shield on friendly targets
<Meanwhile> "Healing DK is somewhat viable"
<Meanwhile> "Somewhat viable"
<EspyLacopa|2> See, now I totally want to see the absurdity of 25 manning dragon soul with only Mages.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I just find the irony in "DEATH Knight" and the concept of them healing. I mean, they have the word death.
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05its still outclassed by proper healign classes
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05but with a well geared tank
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05that knows what hes doign
<Meanwhile> I find it tragic that DK's can heal anyone other than themselves at all.
<Serenity> Wrek|MLG-Sniper: Remember that bug for mage where they could spellsteal Naxx's bone shield and solo it
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: i've heard of the American version once too....they changed everything, the rap song is even used for the battle scenes, most of the dialogue is changed......and the puns......the goddamn puns
<kirzstryfe> those are quite difficult to find Wrek
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Frost DK's can
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05Serenity: yeah that was hilarious :D
<Meanwhile> Serenity: That was fantastic.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya everyone :)
<Serenity> I did it :3
<Barbetos|AtWork> The World of Warcraft, it is a silly place.
<Sumica> 00,10well I am exausted from gravyard so see you all in 8 hours
<Barbetos|AtWork> Death dealing heals.
<Meanwhile> Night Sumi.
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05see ya sumi
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05sleep well
<Sumica> 00,10Sleep time is nao
<Serenity> Bye, Sumi
<Gold_Demona> Later Sumi
<AJIsAwesome> night Sumica
<kirzstryfe> g'night Sumica
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sleep well, Sumica
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Sumica
<Barbetos|AtWork> See ya Sumica
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma yeah, I heard it once... I found the puns to be... funny once, but I wouldn't want to see the whole series like this -.-
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: anyway, here's the kickass theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCMgx7T-QcI
<ASoftFluffyThing> And now, Helix Nebula
<Serenity> I'm amazed how many of you played or play WoW
<EspyLacopa|2> Well, maybe a death knight can heal someone by stealing the life from an enemy.
<Phase4> 00,02oh wow, new motor
<Meanwhile> Back in my day we had to walk to the dungeon.
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma Dide, I have the Soundtrackl XD
<Lil_B> Dude*
<EspyLacopa|2> Serenity: Paaaandas
<Phase4> 00,02more than twice as efficent in vacume as the old ones
<ASoftFluffyThing> WoW....never saw the appeal behind it.
<Meanwhile> Five miles uphill in the snow.
<Moopy> YEAH TOAST!
<ASoftFluffyThing> And all the people in my class have played it but me.
<Serenity> Screw pandas, Monks are where it's at
<Kinixys> Dark92Enigma: Hey Digimon.
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: and here's the funny thing, Even when i've heard the Pokemon movie made it to the big screen in my country, i had NO CLUE THE DIGIMON MOVIE MADE IT TO THE US.....
<Meanwhile> I remember when LFG was something you said in general chat.
<Serenity> Well, they made /4 didn't they?
<EspyLacopa|2> I kinda wish I could play WoW in that wondrous high resolution with all the graphics turned up to max and still have that nice 30 fps
<Meanwhile> No one used /4 !
<Gold_Demona> ASoftFluffyThing: If it makes you feel better, I've never played WoW either. :P
<Meanwhile> No scratch that, some people did, because they thought it was the guild recruitment channel.
<MadSurge> Ohai Meanwhile!
<Gold_Demona> Only Blizzard game I've ever played is Starcraft and its sequel
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: me neither
<Serenity> Barrens chat, bunch of fucktards, but I'd love to listen in because I was around 7 at the time
<Meanwhile> One does not simply Barrens Chat.
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: And that's because it was US oriented, 3 separate movies with no co-rrelation between them whatsoever
<Serenity> (is 15 now :P)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona: I never saw the appeal behind WoW. And the thing is, my one of my teachers plays it.
<Lambdur> We meet again. To answer your question from last night (lol) stormy and I aren't married yet. Four months to go
<Dark92Enigma> Serenity: happy birthday!
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma what I really hat is that, even though they used the original for the translation in germany, they used the US Movie here, I have seen the original Digimon movie, was really good, and almost all without Dialoge
<Serenity> Dark92Enigma: I've been 15 a while ._.
<Serenity> But I'll accept your present anyhow >:3
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona: So it's me, 2 other people and my teacher. WoW nerds. All I could do was facepalm
<Meanwhile> Once upon a time it took 2 people at the summon stone ten minutes to get all the raid there.
<Sumica> 00,10have bank and tabbard
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma yes, I'm a huge Digimon Nerd myself, XD
<EspyLacopa|2> Still haven't gotten into a group to take down Ragnaros in the firelands
<Meanwhile> Go to bread Sumi.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Thank god for Have group will travel, ey?
<Gold_Demona> ASoftFluffyThing: It seems like a fun game, I just never felt like leaving the mmo games I'm currently playing.
<Sumica> 00,10also found digimon 01 in dual audio
<Kinixys> Lil_B: Favorite season?
<Serenity> Unfortunately, because most of my time is spent at school
<Serenity> I can never get into raids because I simply don't have enough hours put in
<Meanwhile> Serenity: And yet people still managed to need a summon by the time you hit the first boss.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona: I never wanted to play it and I'm sure not playing it now. One, because of money. Two, because I absolutely refuse
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: i AM aware the original OVAs were more concise to the plot, and they do shut up, so they can let us get into the atmosphere of the scene itself, if you know what i mean
<Lil_B> Kinixys first and second
<Serenity> Meanwhile: It's the WoW community, they do crazy Pinkie Pie things
<Dark92Enigma> Serenity: happy.....belated birthday? :$
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona: Then again, I said the same thing about Minecraft. Lo and behold two months ago, guess who's playing Minecraft?
<CountDoofus> Ah, Meanwhile. Reikum said you could confirm he's gifted at getting lost in video games. True?
<Serenity> I stopped playing Minecraft
<Gold_Demona> ASoftFluffyThing: Sounds to like you're mostly not playing it just to be contrary. =/
<Serenity> Next time I'm gonna play it is with you guys
<Meanwhile> CountDoofus: Reikim has the sense of direction of a bowl of rice pudding.
<kirzstryfe> WoW community does crazy things because they're bored with the game, but won't actually quit
<Serenity> IMO, it went to shithole state at 1.8
<Meanwhile> ^That.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona: Is that a good thing? I didn't want to play it when it first came out.
<CountDoofus> :D
<Lil_B> Kinixys mostly because It began more dificult to follow the different evolution stages in the later ones :/
<Kinixys> I won't play WoW, cause I would just be jumping into something that's already ancient and I heard it's worse since all the changes.
<Meanwhile> CountDoofus: He once got lost in a cave with only two exits.
<CountDoofus> Allow me to "LOLi"
<CountDoofus> LOL!*
<kirzstryfe> Reikim is directionally challenged, that I can confirm
<Gold_Demona> Ancient? WoW? You should look at EVERQUEST
<Serenity> iLOL! yay for spanish :3
<Gold_Demona> THAT is ancient
<Serenity> Everquest isn't shit, it's just unfair as bullfuck
<Dark92Enigma> kirzstryfe: I played very little of WoW, and it was good while it lasted......i'm not gonna sit through a whole day of WoW, after watching that South Park episode based uopn that game
<Gold_Demona> Serenity: True dat
*ASoftFluffyThing doesn't get the appeal behind RPGs
<Gold_Demona> And yet I still play it...
<CountDoofus> WoW isn't ancient. It just looks that way.
<Meanwhile> Thing is once upon a time I was part of a guild that did silly random stuff practically every week. Like, one time we had this race from Thunder Bluff to the Undercity using only level 1's.
<Gold_Demona> CountDoofus: lol Ancient. Again. Look at EverQuest
<Serenity> WoW is really demanding for it's technology, it shows how shitty the engine is nowadys
<Kinixys> Lil_B: That it did!
<LightTrooper105> im back
<CountDoofus> Heyo.
<Dark92Enigma> kirzstryfe: upon*
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey LightTrooper105
<Serenity> My old laptop is transferrring shit at 3mb/s
<LightTrooper105> hello ASoftFluffyThing
<Gold_Demona> Right now the only MMOs I play are EverQuest (though I'm planning to shut my account off soon for financial reasons), Star Trek Online (in which I have a lifetime subscription), and Mabinogi (which is free)
<EspyLacopa|2> Serenity: It's also OLD
<Serenity> My tower transfers at 600 MB/s...
<ASoftFluffyThing> >doesn't see the appeal behind RPGs
<Meanwhile> Atm, I play Guild Wars 2.
<ASoftFluffyThing> >played zOMG! on Gaia Online for about 2 years
<ASoftFluffyThing> >Insert facedesk here
<Lil_B> Serenity 600 MB/s?!
<Kinixys> I've played some Spiral Knights. Not much of an MMO really.
<Serenity> Lil_B: It has top end i7
<Serenity> 6 core
<Serenity> Spiral knights is generic sega parp
<Gold_Demona> ASoftFluffyThing: LOL GaiaOnline! I used to hang out there! XD
<Kinixys> Parp?
<Lil_B> Serenity yeas, but even if I had an i7 I wouldn't be able to go ever 360kb/s
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona: I know, riiiiight! My account there is STILL active and I havent been on there much in the past 2 years
<Serenity> Lil_B: What the hell i7 are you USING?
<Meanwhile> Spiral Knights was amusing for a while.
<Meanwhile> Then you learn to solo everything and get lonely.
<Serenity> ^
<Gold_Demona> ASoftFluffyThing: LOL Me too! XD
<Serenity> Oh yeah, should mention I overclock them as well
<Lil_B> Serenity wait... I think i derped... wer weren't talking about Internet connection >.<
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona: Oh my lawrd we should like, zOMG! together. Provided it hasn't gone downhill in the past 4 years
<Serenity> Lil_B: I'm talking about computer transfer speed
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona: I know there was this one miniboss callled the Land Shark in Gold Beach and he used to show up after 30 minutes if you were a 10.0
<Gold_Demona> ASoftFluffyThing: lol, I didn't mess with zOMG very much. I think they came out with that not long before I stopped going to Gaia. :P
<Lil_B> Serenity yeah, I derped, I was thinking about internet connection :/
*Serenity facehoof
<Kinixys> Meanwhile: They've tried to give it a story and missions to sustain their playerbase, but it's stuff that really should have been there to begin with. They took a hard hit when Diablo3 came out.
<Serenity> ^ suprised
<Serenity> Diablo 3 was bullshit
<Kinixys> Aye
<AJIsAwesome> It was?
<Meanwhile> Managed one playthrough of D3.
<Serenity> ^
<Meanwhile> Haven't touched it since.
<Serenity> ^^
<AJIsAwesome> I shouldn't know. Never played DIablo 3.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona: It was fun till they started messing with everything. I remember when you FIRST started z!, you were on the train and this dude named Frank for something had taught you the basics of rings and all that.
<Serenity> AJIsAwesome: Diablo 3 was a bigger disappointment than Duke Nukem Forever
<kirzstryfe> same here Meanwhile >.<
<AJIsAwesome> Really? That bad? :S
<Serenity> Yes
<AJIsAwesome> Wow. :S
<Meanwhile> Don't mistake disappointment for worse.
<Serenity> No, Diablo 3
<ASoftFluffyThing> And then you made your way through the Sewers to Barton Town. Now when you start, they just put you in a random field near Barton, hand you a ring and say "Here you go, your adventure begins."
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Meanwhile> Duke Nukem was crispy fried vomit, but I think after that long and with it's development history it was bound to be.
<Serenity> The only remotely fun bit of that game was the planning at the start
<kirzstryfe> D3 wasn't really bad, just disappointing for the time it took to be released and the restrictions in place on it
<Lil_B> I actually liked Duke Nukem Forever, I mean only the level layout and enemy AI was bad :/ otherwise I got everything, rediculus Stuff
<Serenity> The planboard was the most fun I had in that game
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvrKTNJfRTI SFM. Amazing program.
*ASoftFluffyThing wonders if she still has the quick fingers for zOMG! Hm....
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: I think most of the problem with Duke Nukem Forever is the content. It was... wow.
<Lil_B> finally found a good webshop in geermany with MLP-shirts, :) getdigital.de
<LightTrooper105> im surprise I have Duke Nukem Forever when I remember not buying it
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: Nice. :D
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona what content? I expected the game to have Tits and really really dirty and offensive humor, thats what the Duke was always about, what did people expect?!
<Serenity> LightTrooper105: I played the demo, and didn't even BOTHER to pirate it
<Kinixys> Barbetos|AtWork: OMG win!
<LightTrooper105> lol
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: That's about it, to be honest. :P
<ASoftFluffyThing> god, I LOVED being the Healer in zOMG
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta8Z8jXwu9E WoW stuff.
<Serenity> Then to be fair, never was a fan of Duke Nukem
<Lil_B> ... getdigital.de ... I havethe language selection german, english, binary, hex or leet ... o god what nerds
<Lil_B> damnit, they appearently don't have the Pirate partie my litttle Pony shirt anymore :(
<Meanwhile> I'm feeling nostalgic for evasion tanking...
<Barbetos|AtWork> XD
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Ahn Quiraj, oh where did the years go?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Rogue was fun back in Vanilla wow.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I miss them days
<Meanwhile> They all got chain shot by C'thuns eye beam in the start Serenity.
<Serenity> Monk is very close to vanilla rogue
<Barbetos|AtWork> I really miss vanilla Hunter.
*Meanwhile casts swirly ball.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: First boss, everyone was murcered brutally because of thorns
<Serenity> I hated Vanilla huntards
<Barbetos|AtWork> It took skill to use hunter then.
<Serenity> Until they changed their playstile in cata, they were pretty much scum of the game
<Meanwhile> My annoyance to Hunters passed over when I ninja'd Thori'dal from 2.
<Serenity> I totally need to get the warglaives
<Barbetos|AtWork> Did you also leave group and hearth afterwards? XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ooh Deadman's Shadow is open permanently. Still not much on Buccaneer Boardwalk though. Fuck.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I /really/ wanted to go to BB
<Meanwhile> Well, I say ninjad. I won it fair and square but the crying I got for it would tell you otherwise.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Did you need it? Like need need it?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Should of left group and hearthed, then never talked to them ever again, just to seal the deal.
<Meanwhile> BiS statstick. Ofc I needed it.
<Serenity> Ahh, okay
<Serenity> Presumed you woulda played a different class or something
<Barbetos|AtWork> Everytime they pm you for a group or something, immediately go into DND mode XD
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Toywiz Lists Collector Sets and Fluttershy Plushies for Pre-Order
<Meanwhile> I played a rogue.
<Serenity> Heh, all this talk makes me want a Bronystate WoW server
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ugh. Gross
<Meanwhile> You know, worlds first Thori'dal drop went to a rogue.
<Serenity> ^ No suprise
<Meanwhile> Because we totally couldn't get our greedy mitts on enough legendaries by then anyway.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wish I would of did that fishing script back when Burning Crusade was new with my Rogue.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh well.
<Serenity> Even now, rogues have barely any legendarys
<Meanwhile> From what I hear I wouldn't even be able to equip Thori'dal in Mists.
<Serenity> It's true
<Meanwhile> Which makes owning it that much more fun.
<Serenity> Only huntards can use bows now.
<Meanwhile> I guess Thori'dal will have to be content sat next to my Warglaives and Thunderfury.
<Serenity> Do you have Raggies hammer?
<Meanwhile> I'm a rogue, I couldn't even use that when it was current.
<Serenity> I know you can't
<Meanwhile> Mind you, I used to know a druid who had it.
<Lasharus> Mage here. I've got Thunderfury in my bags somewhere. :P
<Serenity> I used to play a mage, moved to druid, then paladin, now I'm gonna play a Monk
<Lasharus> I'm staying Mage.
<Lasharus> Oh, I've also got Dragonwrath on my mage. :p
<Meanwhile> Why does no one ever mention the Ulduar legendary?
<Lasharus> Because I can't wield Val'anyr?
<Meanwhile> But Ulduar was like, the best instance.
<Lasharus> I prefer Naxxramas. OLD Naxxramas.
<Serenity> People don't think of it
<Lasharus> Still have five splinters of Atiesh. *sniff*
<Serenity> But Wrath was probably the best expac content wise
<Meanwhile> Old Naxxramas caused night terrors.
<Serenity> I mean Ulduar, vehicles
<Lasharus> It also caused Tier 3, Meanwhile. The best mage set around.
<Serenity> Lasharus: Don't you need like 50 or 30?
<Meanwhile> True, Naxx gear was pretty cool, but good lord the horror.
<sonicandmario85> HELLO
<Lasharus> You mean people Serenity? 40.
<Meanwhile> Think he meant splinters.
<Lasharus> Oh right.
<Serenity> Yeah ^
<Lasharus> Also 40 :P
<Dken2021> back from shower :D
<Serenity> I know it's a 40 raid
<Meanwhile> Back in the days when you could carry around Ashbringer.
<Lasharus> And a full lvl 70 raid for Old Naxxramas struggled more than a 25-man lvl 80 raid in New Naxxramas.
<Lasharus> But yeah, I'm currently wearing my tier 3. Because why the hell not. :P
<Blako> hi there
<Meanwhile> Because only like, 100 people still have their Tier 3.
<Lasharus> To any mod-person, am I allowed to quickly post an image link?
<sonicandmario85> yes
<Meanwhile> You're allowed to post image links all the time, unless they're nsfw.
<Lasharus> That, Meanwhile, and it looks awesome.
<Lasharus> This was just after I got my Dragonwrath:
<Lasharus> http://i517.photobucket.com/albums/u338/lasharus123/WoWScrnShot_040712_223550.jpg
<Meanwhile> That does look magnificent.
<Gold_Demona> As I understand it, image links are always allowed, as long as you don't spam a whole bunch of 'em
<Lasharus> Fair enough, I just try to obey the rules. And thank you Meanwhile. :p
<Serenity> Lasharus: What's the mount looklike?
<Serenity> Never seen Tarecgosa mount
<Meanwhile> Looks like Tarecgosa.
<sonicandmario85> video links are also aloud only when theres no stream
<Lasharus> It's not too bad. Hang on, I'll find a screeny of me flying about as Tarecgosa.
<Serenity> I find it stupid how Monks can't use Daggers
<Serenity> Being a roguelike class, I'd expect them to be able to
<Lasharus> Ah, here we go.
<Lasharus> http://i517.photobucket.com/albums/u338/lasharus123/WoWScrnShot_040712_224402.jpg
<Meanwhile> I find it stupid how Warriors can use staves.
<Dken2021> lemme guess, they're the class that uses their fist?
<Lasharus> Lash has been around for about seven years now, and I don't really see myself quitting the character.
<Serenity> Lasharus: Oh, it's one of those drakes
<Lasharus> Yeah.
<Serenity> I don't like them imo
<Serenity> I prefer proto drakes
<Meanwhile> Looks quite similar to all 3 of the Dragon Soul mounts.
<Lasharus> I don't mind 'em too much.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Same model, different colour
<Lasharus> And frankly, proto drakes wouldn't work. They're prehistoric dragon ancestors. Tarecgosa's slightly more evolved. :P
<Meanwhile> I have a Power Ranger Proto Drake team.
<Lasharus> You mean five colours?
<Lasharus> I wonder how many of 'em I've got, actually...
<Meanwhile> Mm.
<Lasharus> Green, Red, Rusted, Iron-bound...
<Lasharus> I think that's the lot.
<Lasharus> Oh, Violet.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Haha
<Serenity> I wish I could remember the pass to my old account
<Meanwhile> I've got, Red, Blue, Violet, Green, Rusted, Iron-Bound and Time Lost.
<Lasharus> You've got the time-lost one?
<Meanwhile> AND IT TOOK ME FUCKING FOREVER.
<Lasharus> Those who wish to not see graphic murder may want to look away... NOW.
<Kimori> hi
<sonicandmario85> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwhrUYFwxgE&feature=g-vrec
<Lasharus> A mate on my server accidentally flew into it.
<Meanwhile> It was horrible, I can still see the valley in Storm Peaks when I close my eyes.
<Lasharus> Twice.
<Lasharus> When he told me about it he flew off the edge of Dalaran, without any mounts to help him.
<Lasharus> He made a lovely crater.
<Meanwhile> Oh god it was like, the worst find ever. I was playing LoL in another window and then suddenly the rare alarm went off.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: Bastard
<Blako> not many people here yet...
<Lasharus> NPCScan? :P
<Serenity> Let me add a lucky to that
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hm. I can't get gizoogle to work. I want to translate the US Constitution into jive.
*Barbetos|AtWork sigh
<Meanwhile> And it was lagging so much I actually couldn't see it when the window changed
<Kimori> nope, not yet
<Kimori> btw am cooking breakfast, will be idle
<Meanwhile> I had to call some guildies on skype to kite it for me while I navigated half of Storm Peaks through lag.
<Lasharus> Least you got it. :P
<Meanwhile> True.
*Barbetos|AtWork grabs onto Meanwhile and has a crying fit "The internet is just a stupid place! Everyone is SO MEAN!! BWAAAAAAA!!"
<Lasharus> ...need a bit of help there, Meanwhile?
<Meanwhile> Nah, I got it.
<Barbetos|AtWork> It could be worse
<Barbetos|AtWork> I could be bob with the man tits.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Now you cry.
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Serenity> Meanwhile: What srver do you play on?
<Lasharus> And, equally importantly, which region?
<Meanwhile> Serenity: I think when I stopped I was camped on Earthen Ring, I've been on a few servers. And EU.
<Serenity> We're both EU
<Serenity> Dammit, Hellscream here
<Lasharus> Turalyon EU.
<Meanwhile> Entire team is EU.
<Serenity> Yay, we're all Brits?
<Lasharus> You'd think so, wouldn't you?
<Lasharus> But no, I'm not quite British. Close, but not quite.
*Meanwhile sips tea and adjusts his monocle.
*Serenity copies Meanwhile
<Lasharus> My mannerisms certainly are. Practically all I drink is tea, and I have been repeatedly told I sound like Her Royal Majesty.
*kirzstryfe chucks Lasharus at Meanwhile
<Lasharus> Leading to many remarks such as 'm'lady', which are mildly vexi- OY!
<kirzstryfe> ^_^
*Meanwhile steps to one side.
*Serenity throws Meanwhile's cinderblock factory at kirzstryfe
<Lasharus> Nice to see you again kirz- Oof. Yeah, that was the ground. Ow.
<Lasharus> Anyway, I'm from the Netherlands.
<Lasharus> Close to England, but a short swim off.
<kirzstryfe> Lash is pseudo-Brit
<Lasharus> Grmpf.
<kirzstryfe> :3
<Lasharus> I've been called my server's very own Stephen Fry. I think the 'pseudo' fails to be accurate.
<Meanwhile> I'm sure we can make you an honourary Englishmen.
<Lasharus> Two of 'em?
<Lasharus> (I'm sure you meant 'EnglishMAN, but I'm a cynic)
<Serenity> Wow, haha
<kirzstryfe> lol
<Meanwhile> Yeah that's what I meant.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<kirzstryfe> could make you an honourary Englishwoman if you keep whining about it :P
<Lasharus> You have no right to that, kirz.
<Meanwhile> That'd be English lady.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh look. Some one "barrowed" Wreks work. http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-exyw6lye2ko/UFpJI1giRkI/AAAAAAAA45w/IIpfvQR_t2s/s1600/1.jpg
*Serenity sips tea in the background of all this British related mess
<Meanwhile> "Barrowed" ?
<Meanwhile> They wheeled it?
<Serenity> Hehe
<Lasharus> Why sip tea in the background, Serenity? Remember your nationality. Be PROUD of your teadrinkery!
<Serenity> Lasharus: If I was in the forground, I would be in the middle of an arguement
<Dken2021> oh? did somebosy say tea?
<Lasharus> Are we arguing?
*Pearly hugs Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> Hoai Pearly
<Meanwhile> Well, amusing as this is I have a couple things need doing so I shall be back shortly.
<Lasharus> We are merely having a gentlemanly discussion.
<Gold_Demona> ohai*
<Serenity> Alright cleverdick, debate
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yep. And they used it to borrow it as well.
<Lasharus> Enjoy yourself then, Meanwhile.
<Lasharus> I'll get back to playing King's Bounty.
<Lasharus> Also, "clever dick" would be two words.
*Serenity is gonna plaey WoW
<Pearly> hey Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> How are ya Pearly? =)
<Pearly> I am great thank you darlin'
<Barbetos|AtWork> It was used for this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT0hzJglYt0
<kirzstryfe> Barbetos|AtWork, the poster credits Wrek in the description, but you'd have to ask Wrek if it was ok'd first
<Barbetos|AtWork> Well I don't want to use it
*AJIsAwesome is lurking in the chat as usual. :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> Fucking lurker... I mean HAI!
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Pearly> AJIsAwesome, does a good job *hugs AJIsAwesome* he is a good dear
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, thank you. :P
<Pearly> welcome
<Barbetos|AtWork> Awww, isn
<Barbetos|AtWork> t that cute. BUT ITS WRONG!
<Dken2021> it's wrong? ;_;
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspNaoxzNbs
<AJIsAwesome> I loved Two Stupid Dogs. :D
<kirzstryfe> man, I remember that clip
<Barbetos|AtWork> That VA who did that was amazing.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wonder if it was his normal voice.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Cause if he was acting and yelling like that. Damn. That is impressive.
<Kimori> back for a little bit
<Dken2021> more nostalgia http://youtu.be/gOeo_zHTWB4
<AJIsAwesome> Speaking of nostalgia, anyone remember these commercials? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plTS1WarL94&feature=channel&list=UL
<Gold_Demona> Johnny Bravo! =D
<AJIsAwesome> Dken2021: I miss these commercials. Add more depth to the cartoon world.
<Dken2021> I loved the parking lot one
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone remember this one? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlbAGOIWuB8&feature=related
<Gold_Demona> Aww, Dexter!~ ^^
<Gold_Demona> OMG, I don't remember this! Aw man, poor Dexter! XD
<Gold_Demona> How the hell did I miss this? I practically LIVED on Cartoon Network as a kid.
<Gold_Demona> Or maybe i didn't miss it and just forgot about it. o_o
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone remember this commercial? :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IuC9OEH6HA&feature=related
<Serenity> Gold_Demona: You couldn't of missed it
<Serenity> I remember EVERY SINGLE video you're showing me
<Gold_Demona> I probably just forgot about it
<Pearly> I do
<Pearly> I remembered this
<Gold_Demona> I don't remember this... Why don't I remember this... This bothers me greatly... o_o
<Pearly> this was around in 1999 I think
<AJIsAwesome> Have some more commercials. :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=Pzth7hcueTs&NR=1
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Dexter is too youg for girls though :D
<MadSurge> *young
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: He's a cartoon. Cartoons are never too young. :P
<Pearly> Dexter was AWESOME
<Gold_Demona> Tru dat Pearly
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: In 2012 though he is old enough :D
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Gold_Demona> He's still a cartoon. XD
<Pearly> That was all I watched at 5 or so
<Gold_Demona> I don't remember how old I was when Dexter first came out.
<Pearly> Bart is still 10 years old
<Serenity> I was around 1 when Dexter was first aired
<Gold_Demona> It REALLY bothers me that I don't remember these commercials...
<Serenity> It was '98, no?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: besides, everyone knows cartoons love each other by doing pattycake :D
<Pearly> Serenity, yes
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Exactly! XD
<Gold_Demona> Patty cake patty cake!~
<Pearly> it was all hb cartoons and then others came on the station
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: another movie we should stream on Bronystate :D
<Gold_Demona> Eeyup
<Gold_Demona> I LOVE that movie
<Pearly> Made a place for all cartoons as if they are working
<Kimori> well time to head out, bbl
<AJIsAwesome> IKR?
<Pearly> yeah
<CountDoofus> Who Framed Roger Rabbit? My favorite movie from chilhood. That and Beetlejuice.
<Pearly> me too
<Gold_Demona> Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of those movies I can geek about forever. :3
<MadSurge> CountDoofus: for me it was Blues Brothers instead of Beetlejuice :D
<Pearly> yeah
<Pearly> exactly
<Pearly> I have a book on the art of who framed roger rabbit
<Gold_Demona> And I must say it's aged very well. It STILL looks good today.
<MadSurge> Pinkie would feel at home in that movie :D
<Pearly> haha
<AJIsAwesome> Yep. :D
<Pearly> yeah
<Gold_Demona> Pinkie would make SENSE in that movie
<CountDoofus> I picked up the DVD with bonus material. Watched it yesterday. SO MUCH NOSTALGIA!
<Gold_Demona> Everything she does can be written off as "she's a toon"
<AJIsAwesome> Nice.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: why, doesn't she in the series? :D
<Pearly> OK, spoof... "who framed Pinkie Pie
<AJIsAwesome> She would be the RULER of Toons. :D
<Pearly> needs to be made now
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Oh yeah, you're absolutely right. Never mind. :D
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: the pretty Princess of Parties :3
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: :D
<CountDoofus> I never realized it was Christopher Lloyd who played Judge Doom until recently. Mind blown!
<Pearly> MadSurge, you are a genius darlin
<AJIsAwesome> I AM THE LAW
<CountDoofus> That's Judge Dredd ;)
<Gold_Demona> Chris Lloyd's the freaking man
<AJIsAwesome> I know. :D
<Pearly> yeah
<MadSurge> CountDoofus: he could be scary too
<Gold_Demona> HE NEVER BLINKS IN THE WHOLE MOVIE
<Pearly> yeah
<CountDoofus> MARTY!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: well of course, fake eyes
<Pearly> I still like him in the dream team
<Gold_Demona> You wouldn't think that's much, but then you watch the scene where he's monologuing about his freeway plan. o_o
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: a full minute of wide open eyes?
<Gold_Demona> Yeah
<CountDoofus> His eyes as a toon always freaked me out when I was a kid.
<AJIsAwesome> CountDoofus: Whose?
<MadSurge> I think I can do that too if I concentrate :D
<Pearly> they probably made it digital, or something
<CountDoofus> Judge Doom's
<AJIsAwesome> Oh.
<Gold_Demona> Me too CountDoofus
<Gold_Demona> I was also freaked out when he got squashed. o_o
<AJIsAwesome> His sword eyes at the end of the show scared the ABSOLUTE CRAP out of me as a kid.
<Pearly> WHEN I KILLED YOUR BROTHER I TALKED LIKE (squeeks) this...
<AJIsAwesome> *film
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: well, he's literally staring Eddie daggers :D
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: I know. :D
<Serenity> Oh my god
<Serenity> My internet is a joke today
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: good to see even younger folks know about good movies :)
<Serenity> Keeps going so so so so so slow
<CountDoofus> Some Trivia: Disney and Warner Bros. only agreed to the use of Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny if they got equally as much screen time.
<AJIsAwesome> IT'S TOO SLOW!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Younger? Who you talking about?
<AJIsAwesome> CountDoofus: Really? Wow. :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: those who are not you and me, dahling
<Blako> yup
<Gold_Demona> Roger Rabbit was a Disney movie that got permission from Warner Bros. to use their characters.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Ah lol
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also great to see good animation is making a comeback
<Blako> bye
<Gold_Demona> As well as other companies, of course. Like Fleischer Studio's Betty Boop
<CountDoofus> Hang on, I got that trivia wrong. Here's the right one:
<CountDoofus> Since the movie was being made by Disney, Warner Brothers would only allow the use of their biggest toon stars, Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, if they got an equal amount of screen time as Disney's biggest stars, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Because of this, both sets of characters are always together in frame when on the screen.
<Pearly> Llyod is the man, he as in star trek 3 as Kruge
<Gold_Demona> Right
<Pearly> haha camp nowhere
<Pearly> good movie
<MadSurge> CountDoofus: the ducks' musical number :D
<Pearly> also merlock in ducktales the movie
<Gold_Demona> I love the ducks together
<CountDoofus> You're disssspicable!
<CountDoofus> *spit everywhere*
<Gold_Demona> Dueling pianos for the win
<killerpony7733> CountDoofus Wabbit season!
<CountDoofus> Be vewwy vewwy quiet. I'm hunting wabbits!
<Gold_Demona> Pearly: He was Merlock!? :O
<Pearly> DUCK SEASON
<killerpony7733> Eeeh what's up doc
<Pearly> yes he was
<Gold_Demona> Holy crap!
<Pearly> I have watched that movie forever
<CountDoofus> Meep meep.
<Pearly> he did an EXCELLENT voice for that
<Gold_Demona> That was one I watched a billoin times growing up. :D
<Gold_Demona> billion even
<Gold_Demona> Chris Lloyd's an excellent voice actor.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: try to tell dr Doom and Merlock they were frozen today.
<Pearly> yeah
<Pearly> hahaha
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Pearly> I WAS FROZEN TODAY
<Gold_Demona> Dr. Doom?
<MadSurge> Egh, Judge Doom :D
<CountDoofus> Suburban Commando :D
<Gold_Demona> lol XD
<Pearly> subburnian commando :D
<Pearly> yeah
<CountDoofus> Never seen that movie, just watched the Nostalgia Critic review.
<MadSurge> Pretty much the only good thing out of it :D
<Pearly> watcht he whole movie
<Pearly> its good
<CountDoofus> IT'S AFTERBURNER!!
<MadSurge> 'cept maybe one of the big buff aliens talking like a 5 years old :D

<Blako> in mine there are always many people crowded at the lockers, because they re so thin, so there is no space... w8 a minute... there is - everywhere around... they just cannot make it better way?
<Cades> yeah schools are crowded :/
<Blako> if they make them for one class on slightly differend places, it wouldn't be so overcrowded, but it may be too complicated for them
<Cades> yeah
<Cades> lol does anyone draw in class?
