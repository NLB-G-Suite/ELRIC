<Vivix> Aah hehe
<Alchemist> If its rap we are talking about, I prefer the oldies.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1rpKfVztcE
<Vivix> I like weird white rap
<Lil_B> seriously.... the GEMA... "Well maybe tehy did release this for free, but you will not be ale to watch this until you can proof to us that they really did release this for free..."
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> Weird-
<Vivix> do you have Spotify Lil_B?
<Lil_B> Vivix no, whats Spotify
<SirGanjalf> Vivix: Yea, Beastie Boys counts as rap, and you should like that rap.
<Lil_B> I heard the name thou
<Vivix> swedish music streaming software- costs money without ads, but is nice
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> I recently --started listening to Beastie Boys, and I'm smitten
<Vivix> I kinda like Rage against the machine too, but they're very political, and I'm not-
<Lil_B> no, I'll find my music for free :) or buy it via humble bundles
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> when I find things on youtube, I usually buy it at the record store
<Lil_B> I can like wrep, I'm a fan of MC Hawkins and MC Frontalot... but that's really just Nerdcore
<Vivix> aah
<Kinixys> Lil_B: /)
<Lil_B> Kinixys: (\ :)
<Vivix> I like white guys shouting, I guess
<Vivix> or well, weak ish voice quality, shaky? I dunno
<MLP_Brovakiin> Il be honest, the only rap I like is the kind from GTA: Vice City :D
<Alchemist> Vivix: I usually dont crae for lyrics. It might be political but I still like it.
<Vivix> Can't remember any of that- in general I'm not a big rap fan, but I like that--90s wave?
<Vivix> not gangsta, but the other one
<Vivix> Yeah, same here Alchemist, usually
<Alchemist> Vivix: unless its something really outrageous :D
<Vivix> true, hehe
<Vivix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-58-36lSqG4 I like this kind of stuff, but I don't really know what he's talking abot
<Kinixys> I like rap, but it's gotta be fun and not just all attitude.
<Pearly> hey MLP_Brovakiin
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Pearly :)
<Pearly> Kinixys, old school would be nice for my taste of rap
<Pearly> how are you MLP_Brovakiin?
<Vivix> There's a norwegian rap group I kinda like. Carpe Diem, not really badass or anything, just--stuff. Kinda like it
<Pearly> it can have attitude, but meaning as well..
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good thanks Pearly, how are you today :)
<Pearly> I am great thanks for askin'
<Kinixys> Pearly: I haven't consumed a great deal of it, so I'm short on any good suggestions.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Thats good to know :)
<Alchemist> Pearly: like this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diiL9bqvalo
<Moopy> Brb im going to go watch MLP on tv i'll be back an about a hour i guess
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye Moopy :)
<Kinixys> I liked the 8th wonder link, Alchemist. Thnx!
<Kinixys> Have fun Moopy.
<Alchemist> Kinixys: you are welcome :)
<Moopy> eeyup
<Vivix> I grew up with this http://youtu.be/5mSWupCpm6Y and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLmX7cmhatw
<Alchemist> The Madeth one is... interesting.
<Vivix> Hehe, I listened to tons like that, still do-
<Pearly> Alchemist, yeah
<Vivix> I guess it was punk meets glam, and in japan they melded
<Pearly> good stuff
<Alchemist> It sounds like a strange hybrid of the screaming type metal and the traditional metal.
<Pearly> yeah
<Pearly> Metallica is great for anything they do, thats what we all grew upwhen I was young
<Vivix> My parents liked some metallica I think-
<Vivix> I never really got into metal after black metal phase as a kid
<Pearly> the older stuff
<Alchemist> Steel pole bath tub is more easily consumable for me.
<Pearly> I listened to just about everything once
<Vivix> Ahh they're great. Steel pole never got the recognition they deserved.. IMO that is
<MLP_Brovakiin> Haha I am listening to Metallica right now :P
<Vivix> They melded noise with--more approachable stuff, really nice mix
<Alchemist> Pearly: I didnt. I didnt listen to rock until my 20s
<Vivix> I listened to most stuff, but haven't really heard metal in a while
<Alchemist> There was a pahse when I only listened to hiphop and breakbeat
<Vivix> Most music is nice
<Vivix> it's just different-
<Pearly> yeah
<Vivix> http://youtu.be/Tc76bMdZb5E now adays I play a lot of stuff like this- I really like how calm it is, but I still delve into all the other things I listen to-
<Pearly> haha I heard a parody of this one song Alchemist linked haha...
<Kinixys> Alchemist. Lay some breakbeat on us.
<Alchemist> long time breakbeat favorite (cant find the whole song): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWDJtfKMAxg
<Vivix> brrreakbeat
<Moopy> Hey guys i don't think MLP is on over here i think its just most all care bears
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Moopy :)
<Moopy> thanks
<Vivix> It's weird how things change, before If I were to buy a drumkit, I'd have tons of tams and cymbals and shit-
<Vivix> now I want one cymbal, no hihat, and 2 tams
<Moopy> so i was scrolling up to the hub channal and it showed care bears and i do not care about that
<Moopy> Just saying
<Kinixys> I like the rythem on that.
<Lil_B> I'll buy a Midi Keyboard soon, I can mayke decent Tracks I think, but I just can't make a good melody just with my mouth in the Piano Roll. I need to play it on the keyboard to be creative
<Vivix> Lil_B, midi keys <3
<Vivix> it helps A lot
<Vivix> and I can't even play the piano, and it still helps
<Vivix> I want to buy eldrums or pads to write drums with too, I'm so sick of writing them by hand- takes ages and is just..exhausting
<Lil_B> I'm kinda fine with making the Rhytm by hand, but I just can't make a compelling Meldoy XD
<Vivix> hehe, keys help a lot there- just anything that you can play on
<Lil_B> It just comes when I play on the keyboard, but my current Keyboard is too big and not suited for this Job
<Vivix> I've written drums in midi by hand since.. 2006 I guess? 2005, but then I played drums for about a year or two, and now I can't..stand how slow it is to do all the variations and flows
<Vivix> aah
<Vivix> but yeah a good small midi keyboard shouldn't be too pricey-
<Lil_B> yeah, I classmate already halped me out, I'll probbaly buy his old one for 100€ (it's 150 in retail, but he really needs the money currently for his drivers license XD)
<Vivix> ah nice
<Vivix> also, usd? Hydra apparently hates symbols
<Vivix> 100€ it told me
<Alchemist> man, listening to those breakbeats now brought up some memories :) www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpETQ3fP3wc
<Lil_B> Hydra?
<Vivix> http://youtu.be/yeOvxU7bW4c Jazz can be cool, kids! Don't mock the nerds
<Vivix> HydraIRC client
<Lil_B> oh XD
<Lil_B> Vivix nope, Euros :) I live in germany
<Vivix> ah yeah
<Vivix> I forgot ;__;
<Vivix> but yeah, 100 euro sounds like a good price
<Lil_B> I also like that it will have controllers, currently I have to switch back to selecting the keyboard every time I change a parameter in a plugin -.-
<Alchemist> Vivix: of course Jazz can be cool: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNQK3C-ac1w :D
<Lil_B> It will just make everything a lot easier and faster
<x1es> Germany eh? Thomann.de *coughcough* best place to buy music stuffs in Europe imo.
<Vivix> Thomann is Greaat
<Vivix> bought ..two or one bass there, can't remember, EXCELLENT service
<Vivix> Alchemist, tradishjazz, niice
<x1es> Really excellent. I buy everything from them nowdays.
<Vivix> not so big on disturbed though
<Vivix> yeah I would too, but a lot of my stuff is used or local shops
<Vivix> I wanted to buy a PSA1.1 preamp from them, but it only came in german socket and trafo..electricity thing ;__;
<Lil_B> yeah, but if I get a 150€ device for just 100€ that still has guarantee for 1 Yeahr and I can try it out easily + no shipping.... than I'm gonna buy from him XD
<Vivix> yeaah
<Moopy> YEEEEAAAAHHHH!
<Vivix> Thomann is also great cause they have such a huge stock. Things I can't find here I can find there
<x1es> Likewise.
<Lil_B> I better bookmark Thomann right now XD so I don't forget them
<Vivix> Hehe, yeah.
<Jmo> o.o
<x1es> You know, their shipping is probably their most insane part... Cello shipped from germany to Sweden, 15 euro in shipping charges.
<Kinixys> Alchemist: I'd love to hear some MLP jazz like that.
<Vivix> x1es, that's---cheaap
<Vivix> man..I want a cello
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> Get the money for one then~
*Vivix licks Jmo's teeth
<Vivix> I have the money ;__; but I better spend it on things I need
<Alchemist> Kinixys: well, let's hope they canonize Octavia and Mr. Ingram will get on it :)
<Vivix> like..replacing my broken speakers <,<
<Jmo> Maybe if someone were smart enough not to break them in the first place someone could have a cello >.>
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> blast!
<x1es> Vivix: Cheap chinese cello from thomann, 300 euro, solid spruce top, no cruddy plywood. I was sooo happy when I saw that. Sounds surprisingly good too (considering the fact I have no idea what I'm doing that is).
<Vivix> 300? Wow
<x1es> Yeah, thomann. <3
<Vivix> Man, even with the taxes and shite that's really cheap
<x1es> No kiddin' eh.
<Kinixys> Alchemist: Would be great!
<Vivix> Maybe I'll buy one, and buy another guitar at the same time-
<Vivix> I really..really want a mustang or jazzmaster
<x1es> I was looking in a local music shop, in their cheap student budget section. Cheapo yamaha, 900 euro.
<Vivix> yeah, the only cellos I've seen for sale is by the local violinmaker
<Vivix> so they're..ridonkclously expensive
<prince-dari> jaymoo pls
<Jmo> dabi pls
<Jmo> Matt Smith is best doctor.
<prince-dari> no jaymoo
<prince-dari> y u do dis
<Jmo> yus dabi
<Jmo> cuz i can
<Jmo> <3
<x1es> Hehe, yeah, but then you'll get a good instrument. I look at it this way however: I have no bloody idea what I'm doing, so a 300 euro chinese massproduced cello is going to sound just as good as one for three million euro. - absolute shit, because the cellist (me) is completely incompetent.
<Jmo> ic how it is dabi
<Alchemist> so much talk about instruments.
<Jmo> I know how to play the triangle, I feel involved.
<Vivix> http://www.thomann.de/se/fender_sq_vintage_mod_jazzmaster_sbl.htm aww yeaah It's for sale
<Vivix> x1es, hehe, true. Buying the priciest you can get as first instrument is usually a bad idea
<Alchemist> My parents wanted me to take violin lessons when I was a kid. I was so stiff I almost broke the violins and teacher said after 2 years that it might not be for me :D I was so glad.
<Vivix> hehehe
<x1es> Vivix: This is my very first instrument. It's going to be abused and misused. Better make it one I can afford to replace when I break it.
<Vivix> http://www.thomann.de/se/fender_jazzmaster_62_rw_ow.htm this vs squier- aah
<Vivix> Yeah
<Lil_B> If you like Jaming Jazz Style and Video games you may like this http://shnabubula.bandcamp.com/album/nes-jams
<Jmo> nemnemnemnem
<Vivix> I still have my first bass, but-- it's a fender precision bass, but I got it really cheap from my cousin
<Vivix> love it to pieces
<Jmo> Why not love it as a whole? :<
<Alchemist> Jmo: when you say this I always think you are saying no no no no
<Vivix> Well, I was using jazzbass as main for a while, but then I bought an aguilar cab and omg..the precision sounds amazing
<Jmo> Maybe I am Alchemist.
<Vivix> Jmo, cause ;__;
<Jmo> Maybe I'm not. :>
<Alchemist> Jmo: ooooh, mysterious _D
<Jmo> ;D
<Lil_B> and weith my new WLan Stick I got my new Mouse today, finally I can easily press the buttons again -.-
<Alchemist> Jmo: so, mystery away, are you hungarian or not?
<Jmo> I'm Australian, thank you very much.
<Vivix> x1es, you can also be really lucky. Like I bought a 900NOK guitar at Smart Club <,<... and it's one of the best guitars I have, modified but..still
<x1es> Vivix: Sweet.
<Alchemist> Jmo: okay, just because nem in hungarian = no
<Vivix> Maybe you'll still have that chinese cello in 40 years
<Jmo> Huh, how about that.
<x1es> Vivix: Yeah so far I'm loving my cello. ...It does suck somewhat to be a complete noob when it comes to music, and in your mid 20s, though...
<x1es> I should find a teacher. Someone who can tell me what not to do.
<Vivix> Hehe, better late than never
<x1es> Aye.
<Jmo> I'd prefer never.
<Vivix> hehe
<Lil_B> x1es I know that feeling, still my early 20s but I completly delearned how to play Piano -.-
<x1es> Been wanting to since I was about 12 or so...
<Vivix> Aah, taking hte plunge
<x1es> But now it's happening! ...Slowly but surely. ...so very slowly.
<Vivix> but yeah a teacher might be nice, a lot of odd techniques with those instruments
<x1es> For me it was always an economical thing. Parents went "nope!".
<Vivix> http://youtu.be/gd5H8wTU9_M ARne nordheim Cello piece. Avant garde or musique concrete though
<Vivix> Ah yeah. Classical instruments tend to be hefty price tag for the parents-
<x1es> Hehe, yeah. Especially considering that there was no cheap chinese via thomann around back then. =)
<Vivix> yeahh
<AndChat|665849> Aw man this sucks
<Jmo> o.o
<x1es> "Sooo... You want us to spend 1k eur on something we're 97% sure you're going to break within a year? Uhm, no."
<AndChat|665849> The hell?
<Shardikku> Anyone here ever go over on the M forums?
<AndChat|665849> There we go
<Vivix> x1es, hehe, ah yaah. And imagine brass instruments? Like tuba and stuff? Priicees-
<x1es> Aye.
<Vivix> but yeah, thanks man. I think I'm gonna try to pick up that Cello via thomann some day
<Vivix> I got some other stuff first, but- I've always wanted a cello
<Jmo> You wish Vivix
*Vivix holds on to Jmo and cries
<x1es> Vivix: They have violins for like 70 eur too.
<otakon28> Bugger
<otakon28> There we go
<Lil_B> brb, dinner... something with beans...
<Vivix> oh yeah, we have two violins, but I don't know how to play them properly-
<otakon28> Bad news! Turnabout Storm got deleted
<Vivix> They're not mine though, but I like to plunk on them sometimes
<otakon28> The whole 1h30m video is gone
<otakon28> Goddammit
<x1es> Vivix: I don't know how to play anything. No musical cutie mark for me, but that wont stop me from trying. ^^
<Vivix> hehe, yeah. Go for it. Everything must be learned
<x1es> I'm going through the Twilight Sparkle school of music; Read and do, with mixed results.
<Vivix> Hehe, yeah. That's how I started on bass
<Vivix> Worked out well enough
<x1es> Sweet.
<Vivix> Well I gotta run, got to pick up things in town. Brb darlings!
<x1es> The first few exercises are a tad boring though. "D D D D... D D D D..."
<x1es> Later Vivix
<Jmo> And now the chat shall die.

<Dken2021> I don't think I've seen the main chat so quiet as the rarity theatre
<Maid_RainBow> hi all i am back
<Kinixys> Why is rarity theatre quiet?
<SafariMonkey> Hey Maid_RainBow
<Kinixys> hi Maid_RainBow.
<Dken2021> because she is the least favorite pony
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Maid_RainBow
<Dken2021> barely anyone goes there
<applejack`> hellooo
<applejack`> everypony
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya applejack`
<Kinixys> Oh! So.. people go to the room of their favorite pony?
<Applejack2012> Bronycast was surprising empty under the marathon
<SafariMonkey> Kinixys: How is one theater quiet, I thought they all connected to the same channel?
<Maid_RainBow> hi applejack'
<Kinixys> Everyone is on Bronystate chat, but the theatres have their own rooms as well during the movie streams. I guess.
<Applejack2012> Only around 20 at the wedding episode chat
<Maid_RainBow> i think the mane 6 rooms are open only on Streaming of pony episodes new ones
<SafariMonkey> No-one's streaming, are they?
<Moopy> nope
<Maid_RainBow> well if Wrek was feeling well he would but hes not
<Dken2021> yea, they're only open on movie nights and new episodes

<Pearly> hey Applejack2012 and alexxm
<Applejack2012> hey
<alexxm> how are things Pearly
<Eli> hi guys! what's up?
<Dark_Horst> nothing much, it seems
<Dark_Horst> feel like a morgue
<SafariMonkey> Hey back guys.
<Eli> yeah, i see that...
*Dken2021 rolls a tumbleweed around the chat
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back SafariMonkey
<SafariMonkey> MLP_Brovakiin: :)
<alexxm> whats up Eli
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Eli :)
<Dark_Horst> so, today i read a gaming magazine. and i might have glimpsed upon a glorious future of game developmment. free of tyrannic publishers liek EA
<Dark_Horst> crowdfunding!
<Dken2021> Dark_Horst does it involve indie gaming?
<alexxm> whats crow funding
<Dark_Horst> very much
<Eli> alexxm: nothing much. music is up :) seems like all my favourite arists chose this month to release new stuff :P
<Dark_Horst> the idea behind crowdfunding is to let the gamers themselves fund the game directly
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: quick, call Nittany_Discord! :D
<Dark_Horst> for instance: infie developer wants to make an adventure game
<SafariMonkey> alexxm: Crowdfunding is donation-style investment in a project or product
<Dark_Horst> but publishers dont want, so the dev has no money
<alexxm> thanks SafariMonkey
<Dark_Horst> so what does the dev do? he asks for donations via a crowdfunding platform
<Dark_Horst> he presents his case, his ideam videos and screens
<Caramel> 2,14 I dunno, that's just going to give gamers even more reason to bitch about games
<Dken2021> that's pretty much all he does
<SafariMonkey> alexxm: It's like pre-ordering a game that doesn't exist yet (for indie games)
<Caramel> 2,14 "I GAVE YOU MONEY TO MAKE THIS GAEM! Y IT NOT EXACTLY HOW I WANTED/EXPECTED IT?"
<Dark_Horst> then the community can decide if they donate. donators get things like the game, deep insight into the development process and a tshort or stuff like that
<Dken2021> Caramel and that's the majority of kickstarter
<Dark_Horst> it's how kickstarter works
<Dark_Horst> you should check that, btw
<Dark_Horst> the people who want do do a project go there, present their ideas and a funding goal. if that goal is not reached, the donators get their money back
<Dark_Horst> wasteland 2 is being developed by crowdfunding too, bte
<Dark_Horst> they made almost 3 million that way
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<Eli> I'm with Caramel on this one. It's like buying the cat in the bag if you donate first...
<alexxm> sup Everlasting_Joy
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah, but with tons of people paying rather than a single publisher, "reaching" the goal is a relative term
<Everlasting_Joy> alexxm: Just enjoying the down time between classes :S.
<Caramel> 2,14 which then spawns hate communities for a game that hasn't even come out
<Meanwhile> Allo everyone.
<alexxm> hey Meanwhile what have you been up to
<Dark_Horst> oh, dont underestimate the power of the customers
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Well that's a good message to join on. "Spawns hate communities"
<PillowPoni|Phone> Hello Meanwhile
<Dken2021> hey Meanwhile
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey Meanwhile!
<Caramel> 2,14 not underestimating their power, I'm just explaining their needless hating and bitchmongering
<Dark_Horst> there was a developer of an adventur game who tried kickstarter. they had the goal at 400k. that goal was reached after 8 hours
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm I watched the match (Kane and D-Bryan vs Primetime Players) the commentary took a moment of silence and Michael Cole went very serious after the match
<Dark_Horst> a day later they were at 1 million
<Caramel> 2,14 you're mistaking my point
<Caramel> 2,14 I'm not talking about whether money could or could not be raised
<alexxm> yeah i heard there was no commentry after that match Dark92Enigma
<Meanwhile> What's the actual topic here?
<Caramel> 2,14 I'm talking about people getting "pissed" because they supported a development only to have it be different than what they wanted
<Dark_Horst> i see what you mean. the devs of endless space circumvented that by simply working witht heir donators
<Dken2021> I'm sorry to say this, but that pretty much describes the sonic fans
<Brad[Laptop]> Caramel what development are we talking about?
<Caramel> 2,14 I was thinking the same thing Dken :P
<Meanwhile> Sonic as a franchise has been circling the drain for some time anyway.
<Caramel> 2,14 Brad[Laptop]: I think it was called clouddevelopment or something? Dark_Horst knows
<Brad[Laptop]> relating to MLP?
<Caramel> 2,14 nah, the gaming industry
<Brad[Laptop]> ah ok
<Dark_Horst> crowd funding and crowd development go pretty close together
*PillowPoni|Phone hugs Meanwhile and dusts him
<Caramel> 2,14 now, with that in mind
<Caramel> 2,14 I think it's great if indie publishers find support from communities when publishers wont
<Brad[Laptop]> I made half of my mega-rainbow dash last night :P took 3 hours and 40 minutes
<Caramel> 2,14 because that's just in general allowing for more content
<Meanwhile> I guess if the project in question doesn't do crowd development you should think very carefully about your investment first.
<Brad[Laptop]> uploading pics
<Dark_Horst> indeed. quite a bunch of games made it into production that way that would not have stood a chance otherwise
<MadSurge> Hey Caramel! Is it me or you're much more online lately? :)
<Caramel> 2,14 however, I don't particularly think it will rid the publishing world
<Dark_Horst> of course not
<Dark_Horst> but it will build a serous alternative
<Caramel> 2,14 I'm back in college now, which (ironically) means I have much more time available
<Caramel> 2,14 that...and I kind skipped class today <.< >.>
<BrOnyxia> hi everypony
<Meanwhile> Allo BrOnyxia.
<BrOnyxia> a
<Dark_Horst> wait a sec
<Eli> Caramel: that's bad, don't do it too often :P
<Dark_Horst> i'm getting the article. have that magazine lying around ehresomewhere
<Madbro> sup?
<Dken2021> oh Caramel, you know that won't help *wags my finger*
*Eli likes to give advice he doesn't follow himself
<Brad[Laptop]> Half of mega-rainbow dash http://i.imgur.com/pTsEs.jpg
<Caramel> 2,14 YOU AREN'T MY MOMMY
<MadSurge> Caramel: Oh you :D don't do it too much
<Meanwhile> Val clean your room. And brush your teeth. And wash behind your ears.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wash behind your mustache.
<MadSurge> Hey Meanwhile :D
<Meanwhile> You're grounded Mister.
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<Caramel> 2,14 inb4 I mute the channel "NO! YOU'RE GROUNDED!"
<Barbetos|AtWork> Well I am already in my room.
<Barbetos|AtWork> So... Yeah.
<Dken2021> how do you ground that which has power?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Rubber?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh!
<Barbetos|AtWork> A DUCK!
<Everlasting_Joy> Barbetos|AtWork: Oh no, your room is full of toys. Go to the. . .Garage.
<Caramel> 2,14 How canst thy ground that which is, ungroundable?
<Meanwhile> Ground doesn't look like a word anymore.
<Barbetos|AtWork> The evil clown stays in my Garage... and by evil clown I mean a black widow...
<Dark_Horst> okay, so, february 2012. tim schafer and greg rice in a hotel in vegas (both lucas arts veterans).
<Dken2021> Caramel simple, you cast gravity on it
<Dark_Horst> they present their new project idea via notebook on kickstarter
<Barbetos|AtWork> And no one pays for it to spite jar jar binks
<Meanwhile> Understandable really.
<Dark_Horst> a new adventure it shall be. something that big publishers kept saying no to. so hey, why not get the money from fans.the set goal is 400k usd
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God my school computer is shit
<Barbetos|AtWork> Did it take 10 minutes just to get into bronystate?
<Dark_Horst> donators will get t shirts, posters, and later the finsihed game for their money
<Barbetos|AtWork> Have you tried turning it off and on again?
<tSparx> Hey hey hey!~ I just had a wicked idea and did something cool: "Olim, in terra fabularum Equestria, duae sunt sorores, quae uno regnet, creantque harmoniam terris omnibus." Better known in English: "Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there were two sisters who ruled together and brought harmony to all the land."
<Barbetos|AtWork> Your CD tray is not a cupholder.
<Meanwhile> School computers. Takes ten minutes to type.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No but its bad enough that the virus scanner on it actualy causes issue IN MY SCHOOL site
<Dark_Horst> 8 hours after schafers click the goal of 400k is reached
<Meanwhile> tSparx: sounds neat, what is that?
<tSparx> Meanwhile: Latin xD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Plus it lags like a motherfucker
<Meanwhile> tSparx: I like it.
<tSparx> haha, I figured someone would, and that's why I brought it here ;) off to class now. See ya later everypony!
<Dark_Horst> not a day later, they're at 1 million. after the donation period ended 30 days later and the total sum was at 3,3 million
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Meh at least I have Xenosaga to keep me intertained
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *entertained
<Barbetos|AtWork> intertained on the internet.
<Dark_Horst> and with that, crowd funding was suddenly the big talk everyhwere
<Dark_Horst> and seen as a serious alternative to traditional publishing
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Kinda wish Xenosaga continued its origional plan for 6 games instead of three
<Barbetos|AtWork> AKA ask a bunch of dumb saps to give you money.
<Dark_Horst> if that stuff goes mainstream, it could finally blow some fresh wind into the mass production gaming industry
<Dken2021> Barbetos|AtWork amen
<Dark_Horst> if the goal is not reache,d you'd get your money back
<Meanwhile> Barbetos|AtWork: Thing is, it works.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh I am not refuting that fact.
<Dark_Horst> you guys did listen to me, right?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Who are you?
<Meanwhile> I think his name is Hark_Dorst or something.
<Dark_Horst> the guy who just explained crowd funding
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I'm taking 3D Art modeling this year for school
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yeah I read it all.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I was being sarcastic.
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[School]: How's it going?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Are you doing school things at bronystate?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Ok so far... it would go better if my school site wasnt so fuckign slow and other crap...
<Barbetos|AtWork> The School of Bronystate.
<Dark_Horst> pfff, i'm taling about the chance for salvation of game development and he's being sarcastic
<Barbetos|AtWork> We occasionally stream science! -The School of Bronystate, Shizuka
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJfKZcNDVUg God I love this boss music
<Meanwhile> That should be on the school plaque.
<Meanwhile> "Sometimes Bill Nye is on"
<Dark_Horst> btw, kickstarter is not gaming specific. it's a crowd funding platform for all kinds of stuff, more or less useful (biggest project there was a robocop statue in LA)
<Dark_Horst> that'S the problem this whole thing has. to few people do it
<Dark_Horst> the heaviest pioneers atm are the two lucas arts dudes, the guys who make wasteland 2 and someone else i gotta look up
<Meanwhile> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUnMF7dV86k
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It always upsets me when game sequels or series gets canned because of lack of sales
<Barbetos|AtWork> Dark_Horst: the console right?
<Dark_Horst> console?
<Brad[Laptop]> SpadeMagnes[School] well it kind of makes sense… they gotta pay the staff.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I know but still
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I mean Xenosaga was supposed to have 6-7 games origionally
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It got cut in half
<Brad[Laptop]> Unless you wanna voulenteer like 2 years of your life for no pay :P
<Brad[Laptop]> I wonder how much it costs to make one MLP episode
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: This video is awesome!
<Meanwhile> Ikr?
<Brad[Laptop]> The community could pretty much fund the studio to do it i bet haha
<Meanwhile> It comes in Aliens and Terminator 2 flavour as well.
*Bronysith sets everything on fire
<Dark_Horst> i would love to link you to the onlien version of the article, but it's in german
*PillowPoni|Phone puts out the fires
<PillowPoni|Phone> Hi Bronysith
<Dark_Horst> some good stuff in there
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Bronysith
<Brad[Laptop]> "Sponge Bob Square Pants cost $500,000 per episode. Avatar the Last Air Bender costs $1,000,000 per episode. Some cost cheaper, but series like Hey Arnold and The Rugrats cost at least a couple hundred thousand dollars."
<Brad[Laptop]> ouch
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well my first project for my Modeling class is interesting
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have to make a hat model to put on a 3d model of a monkey head
<Meanwhile> Because monkies need more hats.
<Dark_Horst> TOP HAT!
<Meanwhile> Too obvious.
<Meanwhile> Diving helmet?
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Dark_Horst> bowler?
<Meanwhile> Allo Serenity.
<Serenity> Internet, after 2 weeks of being DED, is FINALLY fixed
<Dark_Horst> how about AJs stetson?
<Serenity> Also, my 4gb of RAM arrived :)
<Malavolent> Ello there, everybrony!
<Meanwhile> Police helmet?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hey there Malavolent
<Serenity> So El shitbox is a tiny bit less shit
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well since this is the first thing I ever tried doing I'm going to do something simple
<PillowPoni|Phone> Hi Malavolent
<Dark_Horst> Serenity: why hello there, welcome back tothe world
<alexxm> how are you Malavolent
<Serenity> I know, only game I had installed was cry of fear
<Serenity> Need to install Counter Strike, Quake 1 2 and 3 and mabye TF2
<Meanwhile> "Maybe" TF2?
<Malavolent> alexxm: I'm pretty good :), what about you?
<Serenity> Meanwhile: El shitbox only has 256 mb of video memory
<Unnr> Is it suppose to be the Buffer Show?
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/00vkQ.jpg
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hah I made the most bitching tophat
<Kinixys> I can think of good reasons for not installing tf2. Like... i dunno.. sleep.
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[School]: pics or it... well, you knwo
<Meanwhile> Sleep is overrated, think of the time you could spend collecting hats.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sleep? Pfff
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Disregard Sleep, Play WoW
<Unnr> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0-YTpAMmew
*PillowPoni|Phone sleeps
<Kinixys> When will you have time to dream of hats? Oh yes. between map loading. Silly me!
<Meanwhile> World of Pandacraft.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> mornin everypony :)
<CountDoofus> Played WoW for 5 years. Bored with it now. Pandaren won't change that. :(
<Meanwhile> ^
<CountDoofus> Haio Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Kinixys> Good morn'n Sketch_Toku_Brony.
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: A Missing Note
<PillowPoni|Phone> World of Warcraft. Everytime I see an ad for it on the TV I change the channel instantly
<Meanwhile> Ded.
<Everlasting_Joy> PillowPoni|Phone: I don't blame you.
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Sketch_Toku_Brony!
<PillowPoni|Phone> Hallo Sketch_Toku_Brony~
<Dark_Horst> i neer saw an ad for wow on tv
<Dark_Horst> germany doesnt seem to do that
<Dken2021> Dark_Horst not even the celebrity ads?
<Dark_Horst> well, there were german verison of the shattner/troyer/norris ads
<PillowPoni|Phone> Everlasting_Joy; I have friends that play it. All I did was facepal? So hard
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Pandaria is gonna be so bitching
<CountDoofus> Though I gotta be honest, the Mists of Pandaria opening cinematic was pretty great. But it ends there.
<Dark_Horst> but they diasppeared wuickly
<PillowPoni|Phone> Facepalm*
<Dark_Horst> *quickly
<Serenity> CountDoofus: Actually, I thought that cinematic was retarded
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HACADr823oU&feature=relmfu
<Everlasting_Joy> PillowPoni|Phone: It's funny, I had friends who played it, now they don't. What's funny is, the wanted to get me to play.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I still think WoW is fun, I doubt anything will get me to replace it
<PillowPoni|Phone> Everlasting_Joy "you get a free trial!" "Nope"
<Everlasting_Joy> PillowPoni|Phone: Yeah no kidding.
<Dark_Horst> played it myself for a long time. but somehow it doesnt seem to be worht the 13 bucks a month
<KnifeH> How's my drawing? http://i47.tinypic.com/35031w6.jpg
<Dark_Horst> anymore
<PillowPoni|Phone> I would rather watch a horrible reenactment of MvM than play WoW
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[School]: To be fair, it dosn't look bad, it's just not my cup of tea.
<Jmo> Very nice KnifeH
<Everlasting_Joy> KnifeH: So far so good :).
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I had so much free time in summer I grinded from 60 to 80 in less than a month
<Meanwhile> I'm sure Mists'll still be entertaining but after Kil'jaeden, The Lich King, and Deathwing I'm leaving my daggers hung up.
<PillowPoni|Phone> Knife*: beautiful <3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I was SUPER bored that month
<Dark_Horst> why yes, that is quite the quality drawing there
<Kinixys> I thought I would play WoW, but I couldn't come up with enough positive reasons to.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The Dragon soul nerf is getting ridiculace
<PillowPoni|Phone> KnifeH; its beautiful. All my envy
<SpadeMagnes[School]> As of Pandaria the debuff reduces Enemy Health and their damage dealt by 35%
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You CAN turn it off though
<Meanwhile> Why would anyone bother though.
<Dark_Horst> say.... does anyone know what the FO:E mod guys are doing atm?
<Meanwhile> There's nothing to gain by turning it off.
<Meanwhile> Back in my day there was no "noob mode"
<Kinixys> KnifeH: Nice work there! The eyes are 'specially well done.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3l1oMp-isw
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I never upgraded my healing axe in dragonsoul
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I always lost the weapon rolls in DS in my raid
<KnifeH> Kinixys: I'm the eyemastah
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So I have the Eye of Purification for all of Dragon Soul
<Meanwhile> Last rogue out of 3 to get the legendaries. By the time they were finished we had DS HC on farm.
<Dark_Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: ....what is that?
<Meanwhile> And get this, the first one we gave them too buggered off.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Am I lame for never doing a heroic Cata raid?
<Serenity> I've never done one, but that's because WoW is MLG as hell
<Dark_Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: it looks like power rangers... but with wizards
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dark_Horst Kamen Rider Wizard :)
<Dark_Horst> so kamen rider it is
<Dark_Horst> .....with wizards
<Dark_Horst> oh god, it pains my head to see anime style intros eneacted by real actors
<Everlasting_Joy> Dark_Horst: Oh jeez, now I've got that running through my head.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Man its gonna take forever to get a Desktop computer
<Dark_Horst> Everlasting_Joy: here, pruge it http://wylfden.deviantart.com/art/ponycraft2-326374633
<Dark_Horst> *purge
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> its pretty good,plus the song is catchy :$ "Maji ka Maji da Maji de Showtime~"
<Everlasting_Joy> Dark_Horst: Thanks, I needed that.
<Dark_Horst> no offense, but i usually despise japanese msuic. the only soundtrack in that direction i liked are the ghost in the shell SAC intros
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Wizard and W have pretty good stories if ya wanna get into Kamen Rider,W is kinda hardboiled detective really good story
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah i see its cool
<Dark_Horst> and one or the other digimon soundtrack that i grew up with amybe. not so sure about those, only ever heard the german version. but hey, they are pretty damn close to the japanese ones
<Everlasting_Joy> Dark_Horst: You might like this- http://everlastingjoy.deviantart.com/favourites/#/d5ecin5
<Kandarihu> BTW, there's a new Friendship is Witchcraft short.
<Dark_Horst> oh RD, i feel your pain
<Dark_Horst> hehe... that'S funny B)
<Everlasting_Joy> I laughed at it :).
<Everlasting_Joy> Wait wait! There needs to be an emoticon on here with Dash wearing sunglesses, I just thought of it with your emoticon Dark_Horst!
<alexxm> Sketch_Toku_Brony how do we know if wizard has a good story yet didn't it start a few weeks ago
<Dark_Horst> yeah, it always bugged me that we had nothing like that

<SpadeMagnes[School]> And his Tropical Resort remix is a actual remix unlike the one in Generations 3DS
<Dark_Horst> *definately
<Dark_Horst> talked too much about developers today
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Yeah. I kind of liked it, but it DEFINITELY wasn't a remix.
<SafariMonkey> Vordox: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocKiCIsa6mA

<Kammerjunk> Did I walk in on an unexpected dead hour?
<Meanwhile> Wouldn't say dead
<Meanwhile> More like...floundering.
<Applejack2012> tris to dust of chat
<Applejack2012> tries
<Wirisme> achoo
<Kammerjunk> I like that word. "Floundering".
<Everlasting_Joy> Kammerjunk: Yep.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sure is fishy around here
<Applejack2012> Its haf dead
<Applejack2012> half
<Kammerjunk> Everybody's dead, Dave.-
<Everlasting_Joy> I was watching the "me too" line from The Matrix Reloaded, and I stumble into scenes with Q.
<Everlasting_Joy> Good stuff I tell ya.
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Peterson isn't is he?
<Kammerjunk> Everybody, Dave.
<Kammerjunk> Everlasting_Joy: The best part of the Matrix is when Smith says that Keanu Reeves looks surprised,.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Send in everyone
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: What Captain Hollister?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[School]: Which one?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> EVERYONE!
<AJIsAwesome> I love that line. :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Kammerjunk: *facehoof.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Everybody's -dead-, Dave.
<AJIsAwesome> Brb.
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Not Chen?
<Applejack2012> cya
<AdamTheDuck> So this is what BronyState after dark is like Jmo? :P
<Kammerjunk> Gordon Bennet, yes Chen. Everbody, everybody's dead, Dave.
<Meanwhile> Wait a minute, are you trying to tell me everybody's dead?
<Kammerjunk> Shouldn't have let him out in the first place...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> echo
<Meanwhile> Man I love Red Dwarf.
<SafariMonkey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjc_sgQ2n1E&feature=player_embedded
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Good old Tv tropes... how I love thee
<Wirisme> I rarely go on there anymore for some reason
<Kammerjunk> I can't TV Tropes. It's too confusing.
<riskii> honk
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Grammar how do
<Kammerjunk> Maybe it's just me who can't brain, but I can't the site.
<riskii> Oh people are actually talking here
<Applejack2012> TV Tropes removed the FiM reviews
<riskii> Okay
<Kammerjunk> Too biased?
<riskii> I try not to spend time on tv tropes
<Dark92Enigma> Applejack2012 WHY?
<Applejack2012> Don't know why Dark I had some up
<riskii> What
<Kammerjunk> Dark92Enigma: Because it's FiM. The reviews were likely either bias in favour of the show or against it.
<Dark92Enigma> Oh
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/kOAqO.png
<riskii> Oh
<Kammerjunk> Suddenly, Shizuka.
<Everlasting_Joy> I must depart. I have a class to go to.
<alexxm> so Dark92Enigma any word on how jerry lawlers doing?
<Kammerjunk> Everlasting_Joy: You go!
<emerald> sup everypony
<Dark92Enigma> Suddenly, Shizulink
<Meanwhile> Bye Everlasting_Joy. Learn something.
<Jmo> nemnemnemnem
<riskii> I recognized that as a stupid minecraft thing that was trying to be meaningful or something and then I remembered today is 9/11 and went oh
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye Everlasting_Joy

<Dark92Enigma> Stay strong Jerry ''THE KING'' Lawler
<CCCP> alexxm eh

<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: it's been 11 years already :O
<pony_8069> hi
<MadSurge> Hiyo CCCP!
<riskii> I wonder what is going on I am confused
<CCCP> hi pony_8069
<CCCP> hello MadSurge
<pony_8069> hello pony
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: I wonder how many of use were children during 9/11
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I know 9/11 was a tragedy but its been 11 fucking years.. I think we can stop making a big deal out of it
<MadSurge> *us
<Wirisme> I was 11 i think
<Wirisme> or 12
<Wirisme> Yeah 12
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: this, so much
<Shizuka> 13today we learn who is respectful and who isn't
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm Hopefully yes, i mean the faint happened after his last match.......i sorta wanted him to become WWE champ, but at least he won his last match
<Meanwhile> 11 years ago I was...8.
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: how?
<riskii> Nice purple text dude
<AJIsAwesome> Back.
<Buytoast> What's going on now?
<SafariMonkey> CCCP: Sorry were you trying to be discreet? :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I dont mind paying respects but they make such a big deal out of it every time
<Meanwhile> I didn't care then, and I don't care now. Tragic yes, and I don't choose not to care, I just don't.
<Buytoast> Are we talking about 9/11?
<SafariMonkey> Heya AJIsAwesome
<Wirisme> This is the first I've heard of it today
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: Thanks. :)
<Wirisme> Then again I'm in the wrong country
<alexxm> Dark92Engima perhaps have william regal replace him on commety?
<Dark92Enigma> I've gone all Christopher Walken here: HOW? I DON'T KNOW
<CCCP> SafariMonkey no its okay =/
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: HI!
<AJIsAwesome> WHat are we talking about THIS time? :S
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Hello! :)
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Thanks. :)
<riskii> I don't understand how anyone who wasn't involved or related to someone who was involved in 9/11 attacks can be so emotional. This is just me saying I don't understand it personally.
<Dark92Enigma> Oh, today is 9/11.......:'(
<CCCP> how do turn that fucking ping off?
<Dark92Enigma> i just realized it
<Serenity> Meanwhile: I'm the same, even if it is insensitive
<SafariMonkey> In Britain it's 11/9
<Serenity> ^
<Meanwhile> ^^
<MadSurge> ^^^
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^^^^
<riskii> vvvvv
<Shizuka> 13september 11, the day each year that 80% of the internet turns into sociopaths
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP the ping you get when you get a reply?
<Meanwhile> English Bronies represent. Politely.
<riskii> Nice purple text dude
<CCCP> Shizuka turns into? arnet they already?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The hell are you talking about Shizu
<CCCP> Dark92Enigma yes
<Buytoast> I was wondering why there was a small group of homeless people in the Subway singing "God Bless America" today.
<Serenity> Use mIRC
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP I don't have a problem with it
<Serenity> You can configure it
<SafariMonkey> CCCP: I use Pidgin
<Serenity> Buytoast: Mm.... subway
<DashWithRainbows> Meanwhile There are English people here?
<DashWithRainbows> Oh mah gawd.
<Serenity> ^ Ofc
<Meanwhile> Inject your tea DWR.
<Buytoast> No, not the sandwich place.
<Serenity> DashWithRainbows: There's Brits everywhere
<Buytoast> The train Subway.
<Buytoast> With the trains.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: It's been long enough to be safe to make 9/11 jokes, but I like only general jokes about it. Am I a sociopath? :(
<SafariMonkey> CCCP: If you have windows 7 (maybe vista) you can mute your browser
<Dark92Enigma> Hispanic Bronies like yours truly, stand in sign of respect
<DashWithRainbows> Meanwhile Can't, some Londoner stabbed me and stole my syringes.
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: No, you're a worrywart.
<Shizuka> 13I'll give a word of warning. It is not safe to make 9/11 jokes.
<riskii> I think maybe shizuka may be baiting people thinking-
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka Oh, you mean because of the jokes?
<riskii> Oh so that was directed at us
<Serenity> DashWithRainbows: Yeah, London has a habit of stealing syringes
<MadSurge> Shizuka: no intention to make one
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: I rest my case....i knew it
<CCCP> its pretty fucking stupid when people think that since its been 11 years 9/11 jokes are okay...
<Meanwhile> Typical DWR.
<SafariMonkey> Meanwhile: I second that motion.
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: i won't make A SINGLE ONE
<DashWithRainbows> I think it was Neil.
<DashWithRainbows> He lives in London, doesn't he?
<riskii> Shizuka I don't know why I am a sociopath for not understanding if that is what you are implying. I want to understand.
<Meanwhile> You managed to get stabbed by Neil? Were you dogging?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I feel safe to say since I never lost anyone in 9/11 I can't feel the same way as the people who did
<SafariMonkey> Meanwhile: The one at 19:44:52
<Buytoast> I'm tired of all the complaining and NEVER FORGET I always hear about making jokes about this day. Just in general, not restricted to this place.
<MadSurge> CCCP: some jokes can be made. Only light stuff, though.
<Dark92Enigma> Then in that case DO NOT........I repeat DO NOT watch (or re-watch) NC's review of Once Upon a Forest.
<Serenity> Anyway, I would reccomend that we don't talk about 11/9 or 9/11 because around 80% of the interent are dicks and insensitive
<riskii> I only joke about "NEVER FORGET" whenever something mildly negative happens but people say 'never forget' about all kinds of stuff.
<Dark92Enigma> AT LEAST NOT TODAY
<CCCP> MadSurge no every joke can be made, doesnt mean they'll be funny
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Anyone want to bet when I get on WoW trade is gonna be full of 9/11 shit?
<MadSurge> CCCP: that too
<DashWithRainbows> 1/1/2012 Never forget.
<CCCP> also id say about 100% of the internet are dicks =/
<Serenity> SpadeMagnes[School]: Rather listen to Barrens chat :L
<Wirisme> I'm usually not a dick
<Meanwhile> http://derpy.me/iUs0o
<MadSurge> CCCP: that's why bronies are like an oasis in a shit sea :D
<Dark92Enigma> AGAIN: Do not watch NC's review of Once Upon a Forest........TODAY
<riskii> Every person has a differing opinion that will offend anybody if it is brought out. The key words here are brought out
<Dark92Enigma> NOT TODAY
<Wirisme> Once upon a forest?
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Rubbish, bronies are dicks a lot of the time too.
<CCCP> MadSurge but bronies arnt that nice :P
<Wirisme> Which one was that again?
<Wirisme> RRRRRRheumatism?
<Dark92Enigma> YES
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Most of the bronies are good... THEN there are the nutcases
<Serenity> MadSurge: Actually, around 90% of the brony community are fucktards, this site and a few others are exceptions
<Caramel> 2,14 awwww, don't ruin his innocent optimism! It never comes back when you lose it :P
<CCCP> MadSurge but some are nice
<Meanwhile> Serenity: I think you'll find a lot of people on here are fucktards as well.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> <.<
<MadSurge> Serenity and CCCP: that's why I stick around :$
<Caramel> 2,14 meanwhile: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAA?
<Serenity> Meanwhile: It's true, yeah.
<riskii> Like I said before, you can end up hating anybody if a certain opinion they have is brought out. At least I think so.
<Caramel> 2,14 no one EVER misbehaves in Bronystate <.< >.>
<CCCP> Meanwhile *hugs
<Dark92Enigma> R to the H to the E to the U to the M-ATISM----------Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrheumatism!!!!!
<Shizuka> 13not for long anyway
<Meanwhile> Hehe, sounds legit Val.
<Wirisme> Except when I go all canterlock on movie night
<Serenity> Shizuka: Soon... *.*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Opinions on the internet?! HAHAHAHAH
<Dark92Enigma> I go all italic on movie night
<killerpony7733> Shizuka Yeah but there are those that just think they are gods and can't be touched and realise they aren't with perma ban~
<Meanwhile> Not for long if they're just trolling Shizu, unfortunately being stupid isn't a bannable offense.
<Serenity> Well, I'm hungry for cake now my interent is resored
<Shizuka> 13yet
<Dark92Enigma> like: insert this theme, or quoting another theme
<Dark_Horst> hey, did we ever have madmax 2 for movie night?
<Caramel> 2,14 inb4 we have mandatory IQ tests for first time users :P
<Meanwhile> Keep pushing for that one Shizu. <3
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<CCCP> how about that creationism?
<SafariMonkey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6azjN8iedTQ
<Unnr> Caramel: KoL style altar of literacy?
<Metronome> Still no Stream? :/
<riskii> You can get around even a k-line if you care enough but at that point it's kind of just give up because it's not worth it :)
<Sumica> 00,10hmmm the A movie is rather long perhaps they should have spent less time trying to not talk about it.
<Serenity> Shizuka: If being stupid was a bannable offence, this IRC chat would probably have a population of 1, and that would probably be DCD
<Shizuka> 13if you have one bucket that holds 2 gallons, and another bucket that holds 3 gallons
<Shizuka> 13how many buckets do you have?
<MadSurge> Caramel: I like my innocent optimism :D
<Meanwhile> 2.
<CCCP> has DCD been on in a while?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Shizuka: I ask who the fuck cares
<Dark92Enigma> OH.......yeah....that A MOVIE
<Buytoast> 5 buckets
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Whose?
<Serenity> Shizuka: 2
<Unnr> shizuka, at least 1
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: miiiiiine!
<Dark92Enigma> Dovah i won't fell for it this time
<Dark92Enigma> fall*
<Meanwhile> CCCP: He hasn't been on (Or at least I haven't seen him) in ages.
<CCCP> Meanwhile okay
<Unnr> shizuka, probably no more than 10, unless you are some form of bucket-based professional
<DashWithRainbows> Because he's in Medical school.
<Serenity> CCCP: Not for a month
<Caramel> 2,14 I sell Buckets and Bucket accessories
<Serenity> DashWithRainbows: Not sure if good thing
<Brad[Laptop]> That.. was a little bit awkward…. I just told "everypony" to get over here in my warehouse....
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Math is the only place where you can buy 50 oranges and no one ask what the fuck is wrong with you
<Meanwhile> But do you sell lava buckets?
<CCCP> i hope time stops before 4:00
<riskii> Caramel why is your text highlighted
<Lil_B> hi everyone :) I'm kinda here, doing homework, but it should be done in about 30min (depending on distraction level)
<Serenity> Caramel: That's funny, I sell propane and propane related accessories
<CCCP> hi Lil_B
<Caramel> 2,14 because I'm a mod
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Hello! :)
<Applejack2012> hi
<CCCP> mods are too cool to tab
<DashWithRainbows> Lies, you're a super hacker Caramel.
<Wirisme> If you use everypony so much that you accidentally say it, you're probably using it a bit too much
<Caramel> 2,14 im in ur irc, haxxing ur ops
<Serenity> DashWithRainbows: You has a plus. = HAX
<Brad[Laptop]> Wirisme the thing is i never use it LOL
<Lil_B> thanks CCCP and AJIsAwesome :)
<DashWithRainbows> Nope
<DashWithRainbows> Bribery.
<DashWithRainbows> :P
*AJIsAwesome has never used everypony IRL
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Still dont see why you cant use everyBODY it still works for ponies...
<Wirisme> lol
<Meanwhile> DWR couldn't hack out of a wet paper bag.
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: me neither
<Serenity> SpadeMagnes[School]: It's a pun
<CCCP> i dont know why people donate a single cent to anything related to the brony community..
<DashWithRainbows> All I had to do is sell my soul, my possessions and the heart of my first born son to Bronystate, as well as other things.
<riskii> Well I have to go, r.i.p
<Serenity> CCCP: Because one cent is all they have?
<Caramel> 2,14 CCP: different boats for different folks
<CCCP> bye riskii
<AJIsAwesome> riskii: Bye. :)
<CCCP> Serenity :P
<Applejack2012> bye
<Serenity> Plus, over here, it's Pennies
<Meanwhile> So how long before we have conspiracy theorists in chat?
<CCCP> omg
<Caramel> 2,14 you mean we haven't already?
<Meanwhile> None that I've noticed.
<Metronome> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3owwxIstm1r95mhwo1_500.png
<CCCP> Meanwhile thanks for reminding me!
<Caramel> 2,14 if they're related based on today's date, I would have to insist to refrain from them
<CCCP> brb
<Serenity> I'm pretty optimistic that there won't be any soon
<Wirisme> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpLS_MUMq7s
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows Oi where you from i kinda can't figure it out
<AJIsAwesome> Metronome: I don't get it. :$
<CCCP> Did you hear about that rumor about Bill Nye dieing? He didnt actually
<DashWithRainbows> England killerpony7733.
<Serenity> Guys, quick question: How long has Niel Armstrong been dead
<Serenity> ?
<AJIsAwesome> Metronome: I don't get it. :$
<Wirisme> I don't know
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIYGullw4o8 Oh this is brilliant
<Meanwhile> The only recent thing I heard about Bill Nye were his comments on creationists and how they shouldn't be spreading their stupid to their children.
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows Oh neat. I'm from Denmark or originally born in greenland but i moved here to family alongside with my mother here two years ago
<DashWithRainbows> Ha, nice killerpony7733. I hope to move away from this country.
<Applejack2012> I was born in Greenland and lives in Denmark too
<DashWithRainbows> Go to somewhere like Japan or somewhere cold.
<DashWithRainbows> Like Canada.
<Meanwhile> You'll never get away DWR, we'll knife you in the airport.
<Serenity> DashWithRainbows: You're a Brit? Woo
<CCCP> Meanwhile :) and some people on tumblr spread rumors about his death cus they dont agree and are stupid
<Serenity> Meanwhile: I don't have knife, just brutal murdering machine guns
<Unnr> Serenity: nout sure about Niel Armstrong, But Neil Armstrong has been dead for about 17 -18 days or so
<Serenity> Niels still alive :P
<Caramel> 2,14 a sad day that was
<Wirisme> Seriously? I thought it was only a few days ago
<DashWithRainbows> Meanwhile >Implying I'll make it to the airport with enough blood in my body that has yet to pour out from other stab wounds.
<Unnr> August 25th
<Dark_Horst> wuh? bronystate survey closed? i though that was open til thursday
<Serenity> Caramel: I read a newspaper earlier, saying "teh phist man on teh mun is ded"
<Meanwhile> Indeed. Neil Armstrong was a man worth remembering.
<Serenity> I was like oh shit
<CCCP> Can some one tell me how South America benifits the world?
<Sonny> hey CCCP
<Caramel> 2,14 Dark_Horst: you're using last week's survey
<CCCP> hi Sonny
<Applejack2012> hi
<Caramel> 2,14 this week's hasn't gone out yet
<Dark_Horst> oh
<Meanwhile> Fair point DWR, you probably won't make it five feet from the door.
<Dark_Horst> when will it go out?
<Riskii> Dark Horst are you Darkhorse
<Sonny> Caramel?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Music: SoGreatandPowerful : E38 / Laughter And Kindness / Autumn (Derpy Hooves) Cover
<Caramel> 2,14 yes?
<Dark_Horst> Riskii: i'm a pudding
<DashWithRainbows> Meanwhile I won't be able to move from my current spot without a missing Liver.
<Sonny> Is there any chance (when I get better) that I could do a live-stream in the future?
<Unnr> CCCP, Oil, Sugar cane, cotton, and nickle exports at the very least
<Sonny> Or should I just make a video and send it you when done
<Sonny> ?
<Serenity> DashWithRainbows: I can fix that. *Places a heart in the place where liver should be* deh, dun :3
<Caramel> 2,14 the stream is manned only by official mods and streamers
<Sonny> So I don't risk a fail
<CCCP> Unnr cocaine too
<Sonny> k
<Meanwhile> I'll talk to some people in the east end, they can probably fish you out of the thames later DWR.
<Serenity> Caramel: + with good internet and PC
<Serenity> I live at the east end
<Riskii> I sure hope this unassuming box is the text box
<Serenity> I *might help*
<Riskii> Oh great it worked
<Unnr> CCCP and possibly the most important bit, coffee
<DashWithRainbows> Don't you mean River Tempz?
<CCCP> Unnr coffee is really bad for you :P
<Riskii> What about tea?
<Unnr> CCCP, just have a cup of Black Blood of the Earth
<Serenity> Tea is best caffine
<Meanwhile> Urgh don't remind me, that's the worst spelling I've ever seen.
<CCCP> I will never drink coffe! :[
<Applejack2012> Pinkie Pie is best caffeinme

<Serenity> Meanwhile: You'll be busy with Grammar Nazi duty
<Meanwhile> Please refrain from doing so DWR.
<DashWithRainbows> However, I don't want you to smash your head on the wall with enough strength to give someone brain damage.
<Serenity> CCCP: ._.
<Caramel> 2,14 Do it DWR! I wanna see that happen!!!
<Riskii> yay
<Serenity> DashWithRainbows: It's alright, he uses cinderblocks.
<CCCP> Serenity it has horrible acting amoung many other this nor is it that creepy i may wanna test it one day ;)
<Unnr> BBotE is triple vacuum distilled coffee. 3.5 oz has as much caffeine as a gallon of regular coffee, and it has about 2 calories
<Meanwhile> If he does I'm going to smash my head on yours and hope my forehead is harder than yours Val.
<killerpony7733> DashWithRainbows If we are talking about english in general and how bad or good some are at it. I'll say it's getting more and more common to have people who are bad at expressing themselfs etc
<Lil_B> who is DashWithRainbows ?
<Riskii> more like themselves
<Serenity> Hehehe
<Caramel> 2,14 don't think that's possible since we are several thousands of miles away

<DashWithRainbows> Saxy?
<Meanwhile> I'm saving that one.
<DashWithRainbows> He's scared of bugs.
<prince-dari> Oh, maybe
<CCCP> DashWithRainbows nope
<prince-dari> Meanwhile: HAH
<prince-dari> Beautiful
<Lil_B> CCCP better bugs in your room than Bugs in your PC... unluess these bugs crawl into your PC and cause damage... in that case the definition of a Bug has come fully circle
<CCCP> Meanwhile that scared me!
<prince-dari> Dude, it's just a moth
<Applejack2012> changeling bugs
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wasnt the first computer bug a litteral bug?
<CCCP> Lil_B but worse than bugs are spiders and silverfish :C
<Applejack2012> spiders are scarier than bugs
<Lil_B> CCCP I don't like Silverfish :( but Speders are like "whatever just keep your strings out of my face"
<DashWithRainbows> Since we're on the topic of bugs...
<DashWithRainbows> http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2010/11/23/science/23angier3.html
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/CrBP5.jpg
<CCCP> Lil_B silverfish are the scariest fucking thing in my house
<Jmo> That thing, is amazing.
<prince-dari> DashWithRainbows: YES <3
<DashWithRainbows> MEANWHILE.
<CCCP> Meanwhile :'(
<DashWithRainbows> BAD.
<CCCP> DashWithRainbows wat?
<DashWithRainbows> BAD MEANWHILE
<prince-dari> Been so long since I've seen giant weta. <3
<flutter_spin> Spider! Kill it!
<prince-dari> Om nom nom
<Meanwhile> Dat Weta.
<Jmo> Don't kill spiders, they're friendly.
<DashWithRainbows> Giant Weta is best bug.
<CCCP> Spiders want to kill me! Jmo
<Jmo> Plus spiders are cool.
<Lil_B> ... I'm getting distracted from homework... maybe having the chatpopped up and constandly on screen while writing isn't that good for productivity -.- ... and having thwe browser open
<DashWithRainbows> Dari ...
<prince-dari> What?
<CCCP> Lil_B :P
<Jmo> If spiders are trying to kill you, you're obviously doing something wrong.
<DashWithRainbows> Stop giving me paranoia.
<DashWithRainbows> I dislike it very much.
<prince-dari> >:
<flutter_spin> EA tried to buy Valve with a billion dollars, but was turned down? awesome
<prince-dari> You know a spider landed on my head from the ceiling the other day
<prince-dari> There could be one sitting above you, right now.
<Lil_B> flutter_spin multiple times over the past few years
<Jmo> That'd be something
<prince-dari> Just gently sliding downards.
<CCCP> is it really ture we eat spiders in our sleep? :(
<CCCP> true*
<Sumica> 00,10then it would die fast dari
<flutter_spin> Lil_B: I thought I heard this story before.
<prince-dari> CCCP: No
<flutter_spin> SUMI
<prince-dari> It was made up.
<CCCP> prince-dari oh good :3
<DashWithRainbows> dari and then Kettering would be set on fire.
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi flutter_spin
<Meanwhile> There was a spider about the size of my palm in the kitchen this morning, had to move the fat bugger down with a broom to throw him out.
<Caramel> 2,14 it's something like 3 spiders in your lifetime
<flutter_spin> http://flutterspin.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5edy50
<Jmo> Spiders eat us in our sleep more like it.
<Meanwhile> And no, you don't eat spiders in your sleep.
<prince-dari> Nah, QI told me Caramel
<Lil_B> CCCP can happen, the avarege human eats 60 bugs and 7 spiders in his sleep in his life
<prince-dari> Some guy made it up and put it on the internet to see if people would really believe anything.
<prince-dari> And we did.
<prince-dari> XD
<Meanwhile> Quite funny really.
<Caramel> 2,14 funny, considering it's something I heard YEARS ago, like in the 80s
<SafariMonkey> Oh hey Spectrum_Rush
<CCCP> what if you got a cut once and a spider lays eggs in to cut they open when the cut is healed? would they tear their way out? or crawl out of another hole?
<Lil_B> hi Spectrum_Rush and SafariMonkey
<DashWithRainbows> They would die CCCP.
<CCCP> wat did i just say?
<Caramel> 2,14 CCCP I don't know of any spiders that actually DO that
<Applejack2012> hi
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVxfPz3pmMk&feature=related
<CCCP> DashWithRainbows i dont want them to die! :(
<CCCP> Caramel well thats good
<SafariMonkey> Hey Applejack2012
<Meanwhile> Well some wasps lay their eggs in live caterpillars
<Meanwhile> And when they hatch the larvae eat them from the inside out
<Sumica> 00,10Nice flutter_spin
<Caramel> 2,14 those are wasps, and caterpillars
<flutter_spin> http://flutterspin.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5edyti are the three
<Caramel> 2,14 part of the biological cycle
<CCCP> or what if you peed out spiders?
<prince-dari> Caramel: http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/spiders.asp
<Caramel> 2,14 but I'm not certain if those wasps lay them in other creatures, or ust the caterpillars
<Meanwhile> Those wasps just use caterpillars iirc.
<flutter_spin> And if you were wondering - http://flutterspin.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5edymd is my desktop in its pony splendor
<Caramel> 2,14 interesting
<Meanwhile> Oh hey, btw, what do you think this is? http://i.imgur.com/EEZ1o.jpg

<killerpony7733> bunny Shame i can manage just fine without. But i'm certainly looking forward to S3
<Applejack2012> But no FiM posters
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: 'till they jump onto your face anyway
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Leeeeeeeeeerooooooooy
<SafariMonkey> My mum just had a panic attack: "Come here right now! My laptop's making a funny sound, it might be dangerous!" It was the fan brushing against some card sticking into the vent. :P
<flutter_spin> My stores tend to be 1 month behind in getting stuff out once it hits EQD
<Applejack2012> nope bnny
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst no , but I know someone who buys them in large quantitys to sell them via Ebay (met him at GalaCon and I hanged out with him a lot there) and I recetnly sent him a mail if I can buy a mane 6 set ... he said he'll send them when the next delivery comes XD
<MASF123> Give me twenty dollars your wife is in the club
<KnifeH> People always think.
<flutter_spin> Lil_B: I'm not too worried about the mane 6. The collection sets (of 3) include the mane 6.
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: you dont suppose you could squeeze in an order for a second set?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Herp
<MASF123> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT9r_-oHJV0
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst probably not :/ it's really a present from him, but I'll try to ask him when the time comes
<Dark_Horst> thanks for trying at least^^
<MadSurge> :( so no stream
<Wirisme> At least he put an epilepsy warning
<sonicandmario85> when will someone stream?
<flutter_spin> http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11872842 if you are really desperate. I bet ebay may prove easier to get (if you just want the mane 6)
<MASF123> Wrek is here ask him to stream.
<Meanwhile> When the planets align and the old ones rise from the depths to wreak havoc on the world of men.
<Lil_B> flutter_spin If I wanted to spend money on that stuff I would just go and buy it :P but I'm kinda nitpicky with my money
<flutter_spin> Lil_B: oh yeah, I understand.
<sonicandmario85> MASF123:i dont see him in the user list
<Dark_Horst> i know that feel. would try random blindbags myself, but i'm curently busy getting funds for some serious hardware upgrades together
<CCCP> everything i eat makes me think of a freshly torn carcess :(

<Lil_B> Reikim a Overtue1812 , there are so many Overtueres XD
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: much metal, folk influenced, awesome stuff
<MASF123> That guy with the Borderlands fanfic, are you here?
<Reikim> Lil_B: I was referring to that one, but I was unsure of the date, as 1812 has a different signifigance for me due to history lessons.
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst sorry, that's really not my kinda of music :(
<Wrek> 05Y U CRASH
<Reikim> *significance
<Reikim> But yeah, the 1812 Overture is one badass piece of music.
<sonicandmario85> Wrek:windows 98 did it ITS INFECTING YOUR COMPUTER
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: you say tha now, but give it a try
<name> ...
<Reikim> I can appreciate metal even though it's not my thing.
<Lil_B> Reikim o prop, 1812 by Tscheikovsky (<- toptally spelled wrong) about the defeat of Napoleons Army in Russia
<Reikim> I've got a friend who absolutely loves his metal, though.
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Agreed.
<name> i respect metal though i dont like it that much
<Give_Me_Twenty_Dolla> your wife is in the club.
<name> what club
<Reikim> Lil_B: Ah, so it WAS related to the War of 1812...Also it's Tchaikovsky, which is fun to spell and say.
<Lil_B> I can totally dig Metal, but there are just some types (especially the folk rock type) In don't quite enjoy :(
<sonicandmario85> Give_Me_Twenty_Dolla
<sonicandmario85> is that you slender man?
<Dark_Horst> folk metal is a very broad genre
<Dark_Horst> some are more emtal, some are more folk
<MASF123> Slenderman....? :O
<Ponyloverforever> Hello everypony!! :)

<Stallion_of_War> Why is the streamer playing with rocks in a tin can?
<Polydunami> Wow
<flutter_spin> is it zoomed in too much?
<Dark_Horst> the screen cutout seems way off
<Sylandest> bit too zoomed in there....or is that the point?
<sonicandmario85> badass graphics
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: you might wanna adjust your cutout
<Panda> Ponyloverforever >.> ill just settle for that.
<LadyCanary> So much zoom @_@
<MASF123> Who knows
<Stallion_of_War> zoomy ZOOMY screen
<Ponyloverforever> yeah i was off for a while because i had a month off school and then i couldnt go on for a few days cuz i was tired
<Barbetos|AtWork> We are doing quality control for the graphics of this game.
<name> zoom out
*Panda zooms
<Kandarihu> Way too zoomed in there. I caught the sight of parts of popup buttons.
<Vordox> Some sort of Sci Fi Military game
<Barbetos|AtWork> It looks like... Planet Side 2 almost..
<Lil_B> hia Vordox
<LadyCanary> It is.

<Barbetos|AtWork> Rawket Lawnchair!
<LadyCanary> Barbetos|AtWork: I remember him!
<Barbetos|AtWork> I have only seen him on once.

<MASF123> Spiderman.mp4
<MadSurge> Hello LadyCanary!
<Vordox> I see nothing on stream, nothing at all that's connected to a NDA: >_>
<Barbetos|AtWork> ofcourse he plays a cloaker though.
<Kandarihu> Oh, according to TVTropes, Planetside WILL be Free to Play
<LadyCanary> Hiya MadSurge
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yep

<Barbetos|AtWork> Yay!
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/08/31/planetside-2-lifts-nda-heads-to-pax/

<Barbetos|AtWork> Yeah I was thoroughly confused Wrek. =P
<MadSurge> Lil_B: O u :D
<XAX> That room advertisement.
<Applejack2012> I thought Wrek was invisble
<LadyCanary> Looks better.
<Ponyloverforever> :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> But one question. WHy you no roll Terran? DDDD=
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SP2 ?
<alexxm> so whats this game about
<name> red faction
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh. He is Terran.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I feel stupid now
<name> yay hes on ze red team
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wish I was not broke. I would so buy that
<LadyCanary> Good luck Wrek!
<Barbetos|AtWork> alexxm there is so much lore to this game.
<name> how much is ps2
<alexxm> ok Barbetos|AtWork
<SafariMonkey> Bye guys off to play tribes
<Barbetos|AtWork> But long story short the Terran Empire settled a planet through a worm hole with iron fist control on the planet.
<Applejack2012> byh!
<Lil_B> bye SafariMonkey :)
<Applejack2012> bye
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: Bye! :)
<killerpony7733> I registered for the beta and i have waited for so long and no invite to it yet....
<Bronysith> so this is just one giant fps?
<Barbetos|AtWork> The worm hole collapsed on day and the Terran Empire on the planet collasped into three seperate factions.
<name> aim above them bullets drop
<Moopy> Hey wrek how you feeling man?
<Meanwhile> Ded?
<name> no
<name> :3
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #562
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh planetside 2 took me long to figure that out
<Barbetos|AtWork> Terran represent the ways of the old empire. New Congolmerate are a group of rebels working to gether, and Vanu Soveigntry believe in advancing the alien tech discovered on the planet.
<Meanwhile> Oh so this is Planetside 2?
<MadSurge> Yes
<name> how much is this game again
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> name 40 bucks
<Meanwhile> Heard good things, not really investigated.
<name> wow im 5$ too short
<Kandarihu> Ah, I remember my time on Planetside 1. I went with a free trial on my old computer, before I upgraded it at all.
<nerf_soldier> how many people can play per match?
<Kandarihu> The game would lag up like crazy every time I get into a firefight.
<MadSurge> Doesn't look like something I'd buy though :|
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, it's free to play
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: well, this laptop can't run it anyway
<LadyCanary> Ded.
<MadSurge> :D
<Meanwhile> Killed by...some wally.
<name> love these types of games
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, it's probably something that you could turn your graphics down on.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey guys what are we watching wrek play?
<Polydunami> Planetside 2
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: hmm, but i dunno yet
<name> though i only play in ps3
<Barbetos|AtWork> To bad Mechwarrior online still has an NDA.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> soooo anyone play "To the moon" yet ?
<name> no scope like a bause
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nice.
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<Barbetos|AtWork> Kill dem purple losers!
<name> MEDIC
<Barbetos|AtWork> Killed by FF.
<Barbetos|AtWork> =(
<Kandarihu> That game's got my attention. I might go for it once it gets a 75% discount
<name> head shot

<AJIsAwesome> MASF123: Bye! :)

<Barbetos|AtWork> I need to build a new compy before mine dies.
<Kandarihu> XAX, AND THERE WAS MUCH REJOICING!

<Wrek> 05its a question of when not if
<Polydunami> I'll be back later on. See you ponies later.
<Polydunami> I'm out
<Moopy> just saying thats all
<Meanwhile> I take it it's not very stable yet then.
<SafariMonkey> bye polydunami
<name> bai poly
<alexxm> bey polydunami
<name> has anyone seen skenderman he owes me 20 $
<name> slenderman*
<Meanwhile> >100%
<Meanwhile> >Still loading.
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: :D
<name> its a hardcore match
<RoboGerbil> seems legit, a sony game not running after 100%
<name> nvm
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/XLcJf.png
<Meanwhile> Never.
<name> ...
<AJIsAwesome> I saw that on Eqd. :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol slenderman grocery shopping :D http://www.vgcats.com/comics/
<Meanwhile> Hehehe
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: :D
<Meanwhile> How's he going to get all that with a $20 budget anyway.
<name> oh so thats where my 20 $ went
<Dark_Horst> so, just applied for planetside 2 beta. what are the chances of getting in there?
<Dark_Horst> sorry, didnt understand that, lagged just then xD
<Dark_Horst> well alright then
<Dark_Horst> seeing my luck with betas, i probably wont see any of it
<Meanwhile> Who knows, you might.
<lowfn> Hello everypony.. what the
<Dark_Horst> what kind of hardware would i need anyway?
<Barbetos|AtWork> That max unit seems to be borked.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh wow.
<Barbetos|AtWork> That gal flying looks amazing.
<AJIsAwesome> lowfn: Hi. :)
<Dark_Horst> the game does look very pretty i say
<name> overkilled by a rocket launcher
<Barbetos|AtWork> ouch
<Meanwhile> Silly tank, you will never work in a sushi restaurant.
<alexxm> how are things lowfn
<Bronysith> deadpool funny
<lowfn> Good, thanks for asking alexxm
<Moopy> Heh this game reminds me of reach a little bit i can tell from the grapics
<Barbetos|AtWork> The respawn distances make me cringe.
<Barbetos|AtWork> what the?
<name> rhis reminds me of bf3 alot but with more planes and less tanks
<Dark_Horst> hope it's not too heavy on the cpu. quad is nice and all, but i'm not sure if 2,2gig are enough
<name> this*
<Shizuka> 13wrek needs to play tribes 2
<Shizuka> 13or even tribes 1
<Shizuka> 13i would pay large amounts of bread to see bronystate play tribes 1
<Dark_Horst> did any of those goe by the title of vengeance?
<Meanwhile> He has played Tribes 2.
<Dark_Horst> or was that another tribes?7
<Shizuka> 13we don't talk about tribes vengeance .-.
<name> dont you hate those noobs who just shoot a rocket launcher at you
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<Shizuka> 13i could torture everyone and play its singleplayer though
<Dark_Horst> well, sure, story was cheesy as fuck, but i had fun with it
<Moopy> you guys should trying Battle feild 3 it has so much graphics into it
<Barbetos|AtWork> I own Tribes Vengence.
<Dark_Horst> only tribes i had xD
<Shizuka> 13i enjoyed its sound design and art
<Barbetos|AtWork> The only thing I liked about it was a few videos the "pros" made
<Meanwhile> The only Tribes I've played is the most recent one, I don't really like it.
<Shizuka> 13they ruined the gameplay itself though
<Shizuka> 13but i would steal the disc launcher effects for t2, and of course i use the hitsound in tf2
<Shizuka> 13(which is http://tf2dingalings.com/sound/details/363 btw)
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wow you pulled that up quick
<Shizuka> 13chrome autocompletion :3
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ah. I need to change the TF2 ding sounds. I may use those my self.
<Barbetos|AtWork> The default ones are ear drum shattering.
<Shizuka> 13actually i stole the heavy armor effects for t2 also, was nice
<Meanwhile> Perhaps you should turn your volume down.
<Madbro> is that planetside 2?
<Moopy> Heh i remember playing the old TF classic games Shizuka i played it back then i played as a eginner then played as the medic but it was cool back then
<Madbro> also hi
<Shizuka> 13the tf2 stock hitsound is awful
<Barbetos|AtWork> What?
<Shizuka> 13especially for high rate of fire classes
<DashWithRainbows> Mostly Pyro.
<name> pew pew pew
<Barbetos|AtWork> Did you say something Wrek ?
<name> lazahs
<Shizuka> 13especially pyro
<Meanwhile> Hitsound as in the damage ding?
<name> nvm guns
<Shizuka> 13ja
<Meanwhile> Why would you even turn that on?
<Dark_Horst> well, planetside looks interesting so far. might buy it
<Madbro> wat are we watching people...
<Dark_Horst> sure hope i get the chance to do some testing though
<name> well you guys are screwed
<Moopy> then i went as a sniper and sniped most everybody's heads of
<Dark_Horst> Madbro: planetside 2 beta
<Madbro> Dark_Horst: aok thx
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wonder what base this is.
<Barbetos|AtWork> It looks cool.
<Lil_B> well, homework is don now, and I'm finally downloading Otonosihi 2 -.-
<nerf_soldier> why don't they have any games like this for consoles? i would definitely buy it if i could
<Dark_Horst> wow... THAT is the map?
<Barbetos|AtWork> !!
<Dark_Horst> that's one fucking map, iÄd say
<Barbetos|AtWork> How does NC have so much!?
<Shizuka> 13is it me or are there permanent IFFs
<Barbetos|AtWork> Blaspheme!
<Shizuka> 13tribes maps are known for being stupidly huge
<Shizuka> 13it's part of the appeal
<Meanwhile> I have the damage text for TF2 enabled but not the sound, not like there isn't usually enough ambient noise anyway
<Buytoast> So I just used that 7 day days of game time Blizzard is giving people to prepare for Mists.
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka: this is planetside though^^
<Buytoast> Why did they have to destroy Shamans?
<Shizuka> 13oh
<Shizuka> 13that explains a lot
<Dark_Horst> xD
<Shizuka> 13like the permanent IFFs
<Dark_Horst> it does look awfully pretty though
<Meanwhile> Buytoast: I heard they altered the fundamental of totems.
<name> ...
<Buytoast> They took them out.
<Dark_Horst> bit sterile on the open parts, but acceptable
<Buytoast> Half my shit is gone.
<Madbro> ...
<Meanwhile> They....they what?
<Buytoast> Well, not all of them.
<name> lag
<Barbetos|AtWork> The bad thing about the defualt settings though is that they have it set to a draw distance that keeps going on forever.
<Buytoast> But I'm missing about half my totems.
<Madbro> lags every 4 sec though
<Barbetos|AtWork> So... it really kills the frame rate unless you fix it in the config file.
<Meanwhile> Good grief. Why don't they make mana work for all classes and remove stealth while they're at it.
<Dark_Horst> hmm.... flight physics seem a bit spongy
<name> the blues are losing ground
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: which game?
<Buytoast> You want to know something even more ridiculous.
<Meanwhile> WoW.
<RAWRity> bonjour
<Dark_Horst> oh that
<Buytoast> I can't use any heals except for Chain Heal and Healing Rain apparently.
<Meanwhile> Not sure I do, but go on.
<Buytoast> Because I'm enhancement.
<Meanwhile> They've cut off the...what.
<Barbetos|AtWork> bwwaaaaaammmm
<Shizuka> 13inception ost huh
<Sylandest> oooh, mombasa
<Meanwhile> Why would you do that.
<Sylandest> excellent
<Barbetos|AtWork> It actually fits really well.
<Sylandest> actually, suitable for this style of game
<Moopy> so what game is this?
<name> the music fits in so well
<Barbetos|AtWork> Planet Side 2 beta
<Moopy> oh
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh its about to be night time
<Barbetos|AtWork> Do you have a flash light?
<Lil_B> I actually heard a loop of the inception Horn today XD the BWOOOWW noise is nice :)
<name> is it possible to snipe while running
<Meanwhile> I know they were dumbing the game down in Mists (More so than it has been already) but are they just trying to cater to 12 year olds now?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh that is a lightening.
<Madbro> huge las spikes
<Madbro> derp
<Moopy> i think the grapics look good an all well......yeah it is
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: does this game have things like artillery strikes?
<Buytoast> Not even 12 year olds.
<name> wow
<Thunder-Crescent> howdy everybrony also no stream ?
<name> LOL
<Meanwhile> rofl
<Buytoast> It looks like the spellbook reads for 1st graders.
<name> be an assault
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Random Merch:
<AJIsAwesome> Thunder-Crescent: Hi! :)
<SafariMonkey> Does anyone here have Tribes: Ascend?
<Dark_Horst> well, at least the drivers are like battlefield kiddies
<Dark_Horst> feels right at home
<Thunder-Crescent> howdy AJIsawesome
<name> who needs arty i just steal vehicles
<Barbetos|AtWork> Dark_Horst: the original game has Command ranks, and you get orbital strikes at C4 and C5 ranks.
<Meanwhile> Guess WoW's given up trying to be what it used to be then.
<Dark_Horst> nice
<Barbetos|AtWork> smaller one and a bigger one for the latter.
<name> lag
<Dark_Horst> wait.... did it just become night?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yes
<Buytoast> I don't even have an Earth totem to use anymore.
<name> wait what team is he on
<Barbetos|AtWork> Day and night cycles.
<Dark_Horst> FUCKING NICE!
<Buytoast> I'm not even angry at this. I'm just disheartened.
<Dark_Horst> that'S it, im getting that
<Meanwhile> Rest in peace Molten Core. I'm sorry they gave your end boss legs.
<name> friendly fire
<name> ...
<name> lag
<Moopy> that game looks badass wrek

<Dark_Horst> oh look, an idiot shot you
<Dark_Horst> you should shoot him
<name> ...
<Meanwhile> Guess he got scared.
<name> ifire
<Dark_Horst> i HATE those morons who are to blind to see the big fat friendly markers above your head
<Shizuka> 13nerf_soldier: because the current slate of consoles are all obsolete and barely keeping pace with what PC can do

<Moopy> somepony is taking up wreks ping or the bandwith
<name> are there any placable explosives in this game
<Dark_Horst> and suddenly everything got blue
<name> DUN DUN DUUUUN
<nerf_soldier> Shizuka: do you think the new consoles will get anywhere near this level?
<Shizuka> 13doubt it
<name> nerf_soldier: maybe
<Dark_Horst> if they ever will, they'd be expensive as fuck
<Moopy> Its nerf.........or nothing NERF!
<name> ..
<name> lol
<name> try assault class
<MadSurge> Shizuka: I like having both consoles and PC though
<Meanwhile> This game looks like it could be good for actual troop movements if people were willing to listen.
<Dark_Horst> so yeah, 300usd console vs 600usd pc, guess what'll perform better

<nerf_soldier> name: thanks *sniffs*
<robotdragon9> theres a kid in my health class named chris, and in my health class we are asked alot of questions like "whats ur hobby" the main problem i have with chris is that he seems to spend every moment in class telling the world he is a gamer....as in stays-stays-in-room-ALL-day-gamer
<name> wow music is again fitting of the situation
<Dark_Horst> i've heard that soundtrack before
<Dark_Horst> where is it from?

<Dovah> sup everypony, whats on stream?
<thelonepony> Hi Dovah
<robotdragon9> planetside 2
<alexxm> so what are you supposed to do in this game
<twilight_sprinkle> red actually seems to have lost quite some ground as well
<Dark_Horst> Dovah: wrek got into planetside 2 beta
<Applejack2012> hi
<Meanwhile> I don't know what the map symbols mean but if it's points of conflict then purple seems to be trying to hold it's territory near the centre. Probably as a result of Red and Blue pincer effect.
<thelonepony> hi Applejack2012
<SafariMonkey> I want this game
<alexxm> how are things Dovah
<Dark_Horst> i wont lie, i envy him right now. a lot
<name> exclamatio marks meean theres a battle there
<SafariMonkey> Please don't tell me it'll be Pay to Win though
<name> exclamation*
<Obsidian> Divide and Conquer
<Dovah> good as they can be with school alexxm
<Dark_Horst> SafariMonkey: it'S a buy it game, likeever other
<Dark_Horst> *like every other
<SafariMonkey> Dark_Horst: Yay
<robotdragon9> (when it comes to horror) "divide and conquer"......F*CK DAT
<Dark_Horst> right now it'S at 35 bucks preorder, i think
<name> there goes the purple
<Meanwhile> Given that Red's now cut through Purple and is assimilating the southern portion without much resistance, I'd say it's only a matter of time before purple only exists near the centre.
<Dark_Horst> well, there goes that dde. whoeer he was
<twilight_sprinkle> these battles must last hours
<robotdragon9> oh hey its morning
<Meanwhile> Tell me about it ¬¬
<SafariMonkey> Dark_Horst: that's what ruined Tribes:Ascend for me (could have been much more fun)
<name> welll thats a perfect last stand
<name> and they lose a tank
<Meanwhile> At least Twisted has lunatic range.
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: oh yeah, another important question: are the battles finite or some kind of nonstop around the clock fun?
<name> FALL BACK
<Dark_Horst> SafariMonkey: know what you mean
<robotdragon9> eternal war is best afterlife
<AtalontheDeer> hi folks

<robotdragon9> it reminded me of those games
<name> purple is penetrating red and blue
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: I get that sometimes
<name> ...
<Dark_Horst> actually the tech reminds me more of ground control
<name> gunships
<Dark_Horst> and some unreal
<Meanwhile> Someone needs to do something about those.
<SafariMonkey> AtalontheDeer: OK cool, just trying to be helpful. :)
<name> get a rocket launcher

<AJIsAwesome> robotdragon9: The only one I have is Warped.
<AJIsAwesome> I rented the first one. I loved it.
<AJIsAwesome> Really hope Crash comes back, but modeled off the old games. The moden Crash was a terrible Crash.
<Applejack2012> bye!
<RoboGerbil> hmm? why am i getting pinged?

<Dark_Horst> Unnr: planetside 2
<Meanwhile> Planetside 2.
<Dark_Horst> beta
<Unnr> Dark_Horst: Ooooh
<Unnr> That explains the sense of deja vu
<Meanwhile> Duuuuude! No non image links during a stream!
<AJIsAwesome> robotdragon9: I have Racing, Warped, and the Party one.
<Dark_Horst> okay, that is an ugly graphics glith
<Dark_Horst> they have to fix that one fast
<robotdragon9> AJIsAwesome and yeah i agree i want a modern old style gameplay crash someday
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhmm then my stream is laggin cause it's black
<Meanwhile> Wrek's playing Planetside 2.
<robotdragon9> crash introduced me to gaming...
<Obsidian> brb guys
<Dark_Horst> i got introduced to gaming by the first CnC
<Dark_Horst> good ol pixels. loved them#
<AJIsAwesome> SMB introduced me to gaming.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> reminds me of tribes
<AJIsAwesome> It was Pokemon R&B that got me hooked on gaming.
<Meanwhile> There've been a lot of comparisons.
<Dark_Horst> i still remmeber when i laid eyes on red alert 2 it looked fucking awesome back then
<Meanwhile> Never played the original Tribes though.
<robotdragon9> i was seven years old.....its been more than half of my friggin life
<AJIsAwesome> I'm guessing you have unlimited sprint in this game?
<Meanwhile> Looks like it, can't see anything that would imply a sprint gauge.
<Dark_Horst> makes ense, seeing how huge this map is
<Dark_Horst> sprint gauge would probably get annoying very fast
<robotdragon9> all ur base are belong to us
<Dusty> what is this?
<Meanwhile> Slidey guy
<Dark_Horst> Dusty: planetside 2 beta
<Dusty> ah
<AJIsAwesome> The only game I dind't mind a sprint gauge in was Skyward Sword.
<nerf_soldier> ^
<robotdragon9> ive NEVER FOUND a game without limited sprint 0_0 its beautiful...
<Dark_Horst> robotdragon9: you obviously missed BF3
<robotdragon9> yeah
<MadSurge> Ded
<Sonny> Hey everpony :)
<Sonny> I have a favour to ask
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: Hi! :)
<thelonepony> hi Sonny
<MadSurge> Ohai Sonny
<Kinixys> Hi Sonny.
<Sonny> if you happen to know it
<Sonny> :p
<Sonny> xD
<Sonny> hi everone :)
<robotdragon9> EY
<Sonny> So yeah here's the thing, I'm drawing a picture of twilight leaning over a balcony and staring at the sundown but I need to know what her balcony look like :p (already did the base) but I mean like the tree thigny
<Dark_Horst> oh, BF3... you give me so much pain. loving the game, would love to get the armored kill addon... but that would mean giving EA money
<Dark_Horst> and that feels just plain wrong
<Sonny> where she lives in etc :p
<Dark_Horst> meaning, more money then i already gave them, which is more than they deserve already
<Dark_Horst> this here might me a real alternative for big scale multiplayer battles.... especially sicne those maps seem 20 tiems the size of BF3 maps. maybe even more
<robotdragon9> i have some EA games but theyre used games so take that EA
<Dark_Horst> the weapon physics might require some getting sued to though
<Sonny> nevermind everypony I have one
<Sonny> :)
<Dark_Horst> always light battlefield for the weapon physics
<Dark_Horst> *liked
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: Okay.
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: I was going to send you this. http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120216125540/mlp/images/thumb/d/d7/2x3_CelestiaBalcony.png/640px-2x3_CelestiaBalcony.png

<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: uuuh, comic book stores?

<Dark_Horst> Dovah: looky here http://www.blackmesasource.com/
<Barbetos|AtWork> angle!
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Oh okay. :$
<Dark_Horst> DIE, VTOL!
<Dark_Horst> and ded
<Klumzeedragon> It's just an Upgraded Half Life 1 right?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Klumzeedragon: noooo
<Dark_Horst> yep, half life 1 remade with source engine
<HoodyNinja> Wrek be wrekin shit up
<Moopy> Oh ehy Klumzeedragon
<Bronysith> http://rickybryantjr.deviantart.com/art/Phoenix-Wright-plushie-68183008?q=boost%3Apopular%20phoenix%20wright&qo=120
<Dark_Horst> ...well, less of an upgrade, more of a remake
<Barbetos|AtWork> Dark_Horst that is not entirely correct either.
<Dark_Horst> it's not?
<Dark_Horst> then what is it?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Half life 1 source was half life one remade with source engine
<HoodyNinja> Bronysith: So, do you like Pheonix Wright?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Black Mesa is a reimaging really.
<Dark_Horst> and what does that male black mesa?
<Dark_Horst> *make
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: http://www.tfaw.com/Comics/Profile/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Is-Magic-1___412880 here's a profile for the comic
<Dark_Horst> oh well, we'll see in 2 day, 16 hours and 50 minutes
<Barbetos|AtWork> Cuase its more than just a port to a new engine. They have pretty much redone all the levels.
<Barbetos|AtWork> !!
<Klumzeedragon> Barbetos|AtWork: A reimaging would be more like a reboot... Like the new Devil May Cry that's coming out. Are you saying it's going to be like that?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Really? I have been waiting forever.
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Thanks.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Its like a reimaging, not a reimagining itself. They left a lot of elements intact from the original game, yes, but they changed a lot too.
<Klumzeedragon> Barbetos|AtWork: Or is going to be like... Halo Anniversarry? :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> Thats probably more accurate although I did not play that halo
<HoodyNinja> ugh... halo...
<Barbetos|AtWork> I know.
<Barbetos|AtWork> It will be okay.
*Barbetos|AtWork pets HoodyNinja
<Barbetos|AtWork> It will be over soon.
*HoodyNinja purrs
*HoodyNinja like a bear
<Barbetos|AtWork> Seems legit.
<mitamaking> This looks good(graphics wise), what game is it
<Klumzeedragon> Barbetos|AtWork: Ah. It was pretty much a slap of new paint and textures and yadda yadda. :D It was okay. Didnt give it a performance boost or anything though.
<HoodyNinja> Bears purr
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yes, but humans do not purr like bears.
<cachi01|phone> Hi Everypony :)
<mitamaking> purr
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Bears purr?

<HoodyNinja> And brawling establishment as A movie, quite exciting!
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: thursday? how should we know

<Klumzeedragon> Oh and hey Moopy. :)
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Oh, you. :P
<Nittany_Discord> Doing OK MadSurge and alexxm.
<Moopy> sup dude
<twilight_sprinkle> hai Nittany_Discord
<alexxm> so what is this game about
<MadSurge> mitamaking: I won first pony episode, so the lottery is not hax :$
<cachi01|phone> Hax
<cachi01|phone> I call hax
<HoodyNinja> MadSurge: Or is it o_o
<pony_3696> it's an mmofps
<mitamaking> Didn't Dragonshy air just a couple of weeks ago too?
<twilight_sprinkle> ive never won a single time. definitely hax >:I
<MadSurge> HoodyNinja: might be, but I won something :)
<Klumzeedragon> Moopy: Not much. Downloading Armored Kill. :D
<HoodyNinja> I dont even get the letter anymore! Total hax!
<cachi01|phone> an mmofps? They exist?
<CrimsonPhoenix> >Applbuck Session
<Moopy> heh lol wow
<HoodyNinja> Apparantly so
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: I like AJ, do you?
<cachi01|phone> Klumzeedragon thx.for reminding.me
<cachi01|phone> BRB downloading.armored kill
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, I don't hate her, though she has been pretty boring lately
<Applejack2012> I love Applebuck Season
<Klumzeedragon> cachi01|phone: Welcome. :D Xbox is having problems though, so be patient.
<AJIsAwesome> Applejack2012: Same here.
<cachi01|phone> goddamit microsoft
<HoodyNinja> ded
<mitamaking> AJ would be less boring if she got an episode about her
<twilight_sprinkle> wow red is screwd
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: I hope she gets more prominent episodes soon :) but I still like her
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: Hope season 3 does that.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Thats not good enough!
*Barbetos|AtWork throws an axe on a table
<cachi01|phone> Klumzeedragon anyway. I am Premium soo i think i wont have problems. More you pay, less problems u have >_>
<mitamaking> I think season 3 may be one long story
*HoodyNinja steals axe
<CrimsonPhoenix> Though I would love a duet of her with applebloom
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttershy needs to have less episodes and Rarity should have more. also a bit more AJ eps
<CrimsonPhoenix> of her and applebloom**
<Barbetos|AtWork> It is still not good enough!
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: MORE FLUTTERSHY!
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Hm, that seems like a good idea.
<twilight_sprinkle> NO >:I
<Nife> http://i47.tinypic.com/35031w6.jpg BOOM
<mitamaking> Less CMC, more AJ and Rarity
<Barbetos|AtWork> And we have a psychotic ninja running around with a throwing axe. Its not my fault if any of you get hurt.
<CrimsonPhoenix> now that's what I'm talking about
<Nittany_Discord> AJ sort-of got an episode in S2. It's just that Derpy stole it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> More Rarity
<HoodyNinja> Whatever the case may be, we all need a Scootaloo episode
<cachi01|phone> Nife dat applebloom
<SafariMonkey> So what's this game called?
<mitamaking> Or, if we get a CMC episode, make it about Scootaloo
<Nife> cachi01|phone: You're doing it wrong.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: No offense, but doesn't Rarity already have enough?
<Applejack2012> Yay for more Rarity
<CrimsonPhoenix> mitamaking, yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> so much
<HoodyNinja> mitamaking: Hey, i just said that
<Barbetos|AtWork> AJ is the most developed background pony of the show.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: she doesnt have nearly enough
<Barbetos|AtWork> She is amazing.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and HoodyNinja
<CrimsonPhoenix> yes so much
<cachi01|phone> Nife oh yeah i forgot thats sweetie bell...... Right?
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: Oh, you. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> lol Barbetos|AtWork
<mitamaking> Barbetos|AtWork: oh you
<Klumzeedragon> cachi01|phone: I'm premuim too. But Battlefield is just being dumb. I was stuck at the loading screen for like 5 minutes before it decided to load. :D
<HoodyNinja> CrimsonPhoenix: :)
<mitamaking> AJIsAwesome: Stop copying me in advance
<Barbetos|AtWork> AJIsAwesome: did you hear that at BFF too? XD
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: Yeah. :D
<Nife> cachi01|phone: Respect; lost forever.
<cachi01|phone> Klumzeedragon lol i will go and check right now :)
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh yeah
<cachi01|phone> Nife Oh yeah...... A chicken right?
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I'm probably thinking season 2 wise. Nevermind. :$
<Barbetos|AtWork> I forgot about the BF3 thing
<Klumzeedragon> cachi01|phone: Good luck. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttershy should be replaced with derpy in the mane 6
<Barbetos|AtWork> Now i wish I didn't waste my money on premium
*HoodyNinja stopped playing bf3
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: What's this game called?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Gah.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh well.
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: On stream?
<mitamaking> I don't hate Fluttershy, but is she number 2 in episodes to Twillight?
<Klumzeedragon> HoodyNinja: Probably for the best. :D
<HoodyNinja> Why DO you hate Fluttershy so much?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ouch!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Terran is getting thier ass BEAT
<SafariMonkey> Nife: You're KnifeH?
<twilight_sprinkle> "i dont hate her, i just really really really dislike her"
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: Yeah
<Nife> SafariMonkey: Yes
<twilight_sprinkle> i hope someone notices my use of irony :S
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: She will give you the stare
<Klumzeedragon> HoodyNinja: I'm only going to play it until Boderlands comes out and play the hell out of that until Halo 4.
<HoodyNinja> You dont like her because shes so nice?
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: I don't know. :$
<SafariMonkey> Nife: Didn't realise until pic
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Oh you. :D
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: oh you
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: i dont like here because shes overrated and shes not very nice at all. she had the biggest mean streaks of all ponies
<mitamaking> Dang it!!!!
<SafariMonkey> Does anyone know what it's called>?
<pony_3696> it's planetside 2
<Barbetos|AtWork> Flip a table!
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: besides Rarity you mean
*alexxm teaches twilight_sprinkle how to make molotov cocktails
<AJIsAwesome> FLIP ALL THE TABLES!
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: I still think you're kinda misinformed here :/
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: discord ep doesnt count
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Awesome driving! :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> He was making a tent.
<mitamaking> I was thinking how she always blows them off for work
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: thank you! now ill be a terrorist, yay! cutie mark terrosts, go!
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: how
<AJIsAwesome> http://cdn4.staztic.com/cdn/screenshot/flip-them-tables-100-2.jpg
<mitamaking> Actually Fluttershy was the worst in Discord
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: If you need me to tell you how, you can't understand anyway
<Reikim> Dead?
<Reikim> Evening.
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: oh well if you say so yup must be right
<HoodyNinja> Ello Reikim
<mitamaking> Evening
<Applejack2012> hello
<alexxm> how are things Reikim
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Hi! :)
<twilight_sprinkle> >element of kindness and animal keeper
<twilight_sprinkle> >uses fear and intimidation to control her animals
<twilight_sprinkle> of the stare that is
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkle: Um. No she doesn't. She doesn't like using the stare at all, and avoids doing so whenever possible.
<HoodyNinja> Only in severe cases
<Reikim> Also: enter chat, begin argument with TS.
<HoodyNinja> You shouldn't not like any of any ponies. Not even Blueblood
<Klumzeedragon> Reikim: She can't even control when it happens. :)
<Reikim> That's fanon.
<twilight_sprinkle> she did nin the ep when she was trying to get the hens into the henhouse. wouldnt call that an extremem situation
<twilight_sprinkle> *in
<twilight_sprinkle> and she learned to control it in the end of the ep
<Reikim> It was late she was tired and iirc she had the Crusaders around.
<Bronysith> a lawyer is someone who keeps on smiling, no matter how bad it gets
<mitamaking> Is that the only time she has used the stare?
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: Chickens must be put in their place! DO you know what happened last time!
<Reikim> The Crusaders are a walking extreme situation.
<HoodyNinja> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> i was referring to the Otehre chicken :P
<twilight_sprinkle> *chickens
<mitamaking> I mean it would have helped against the dragon
<Reikim> What other chicken?
<HoodyNinja> Shhhhhh...
<Wrek> 05love this song
<Nife> Hush Wrek
<Nife> We're sleeping.
<Nife> You know, Swedish
<Applejack2012> Hush now quiet now
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: I found it (I think): Planetside 2
<mitamaking> Imagine if Flutterbi*** used the stare on the mane 6, that would be amazing
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek: Sorry. Listening to Caravan Palace. :P
<alexxm> night guys
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont hate luttershy. i just think shes extremely overrated and she has been the meanest one so far. also im tired of her episodes where its mostly about her just being shy
<thelonepony> night alexxm
<Applejack2012> night
<SafariMonkey> good night alexxm
<twilight_sprinkle> bye alexxm
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: Well there is..... dang
<mitamaking> I guess the Stare
<twilight_sprinkle> the stare ep is identical to dragonshy
<twilight_sprinkle> absolutely identical
<twilight_sprinkle> shes shy, then comes through to protect her friends
<mitamaking> I can see that
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: You should be tired of Twilight eps and her being overly anal about everything
<Reikim> Hush
<Reikim> Now now, chatters.
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: overly anal? what does that even mean
<Nife> Wrek: I made twi without the book, wanna see?
<mitamaking> HoodyNinja: Lesson Zero and About Time are not all her episodes
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<HoodyNinja> mitamaking: Its not just those two
<Reikim> Look, I've got a room going where you can take this.
<mitamaking> Maybe Royal Wedding part 1
<twilight_sprinkle> ti had a lot more variety in her eps
<twilight_sprinkle> *twi
<twilight_sprinkle> and the ticket ep
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya guys, what are we watching?
<mitamaking> She was not anal in the ticket episode
<thelonepony> hi MLP_Brovakiin
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Hi! :) Wrek playing some games.
<Reikim> I PM the link to all of you and it will move there and we will have intelligent discourse.
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: yeah thats what i mean
<Panda|Drawing> MLP_Brovakiin... I finished it >.>
<MLP_Brovakiin> Thanks AJIsAwesome
<mitamaking> oh
<twilight_sprinkle> and she wasnt that nuts in the time travel ep either
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> twilight_sprinkle overly analitycal i think
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: iirc, Dragonshy is about Fluttershy fighting a dragon. Fluttershy didn't expect a cockatrice, so her delima wasn't facing any fears, it was biting off more than you can chew
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: I disagree there
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: Look right?
<Reikim> Aaaaand leaving manechat.
<Reikim> I do NOT like listening to TS.
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: well she was somewhat nuts, but understably nuts since she thought it was armageddon
<mitamaking> The whole point of the time episode was she was anal about what caused her problem
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: Why should I look right?
<cachi01|phone> Klumzeedragon ok the same problem happened to me lol
<Klumzeedragon> Oh and Wrek, You might be happy to know that flutterchu got banned again. :D Im not sure if it was permanent, just know Saturn banned it again.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> then y start arguing with him/her the second you step on chat ?
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: but she dealt with cmc fine,(by using fear and intimdation fo the stare, which isnt the way to do it)
<mitamaking> I was thinking more, the 3 two parters(minus Royal Wedding part 1) she is not anal
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: They respected her, not fear...
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: You must have missed my message. I think it's Planetside 2
<cachi01|phone> Flutterchu got banned?
<twilight_sprinkle> Klumzeedragon: wow lol
<cachi01|phone> Why?
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: out of fear, after they learned about the stare
<Reikim> Kneejerk reaction.
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: Oh yeah. I think it is.
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: Sorry. :$
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: the stare changed everything
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> using mirc or embed chat ?
<Reikim> Besides, at that point he hadn't turned it into "I don't like Fluttershy because she's boring and mean".
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: out of respect, because she stared down a creature that can kill you by looking at it
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: It definitely is, I can see for sure
<Reikim> Character bashing I just can't stand.
<Klumzeedragon> cachi01|phone: Told ya. :P And I was almost done downloading Armored Kill when i accidently oppened a notice and my xbox froze,
<cachi01|phone> Lol
<Reikim> Plus there's the way he goes about it.
<Reikim> It's self-righteous and arrogant.
<Bronysith> hehehe, love the 4th wall breaker that is deadpool
<cachi01|phone> Klumzeedragon BF3 is still loading for me xd
<Reikim> "I don't hate FLuttershy, I just think she's the worst and the meanest one to date."
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: all of the mane 6 stood up to evil, cmc already knows they can do it
<Reikim> Yes thank you TS, you are completely unbiased here.
<mitamaking> Are we forgetting one Flutter episode, 4 doesn't seem much, Stare, Iron Will, Dragonshy, Hurricane Fluttershy
<JRPhone> Fight.club
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you do realize you are still talking about him even when you are tired of it ?
<Reikim> Yessss
<cachi01|phone> Fight club
<AJIsAwesome> JRPhone: Eureka!!
<Reikim> Ranting makes me feel better.
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: That is the worst argument you can have
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yo do know there is a ignore command right ?
<mitamaking> *I not we
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: thank you. anything else?
<Ryunosuke> o/
<JRPhone> I've said it like 20 times
<HoodyNinja> JRP you are truly a genious
<Joy> Hi everyone!
<cachi01|phone> Fak
<Reikim> Yeah, it's called "leave manechat"
<AJIsAwesome> Joy: Hi! :)
<thelonepony> hi Joy
<cachi01|phone> hi Joy!
<JRPhone> Fight-club
<Panda|Drawing> what are we watching?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope it's called ignore actually
<Klumzeedragon> But cachi01|phone, flutterchu got banned becasue it was like "You're starting to creep me out cause you're a guy." When Saturn was talking about being with his BF and that he said hello and such.
<HoodyNinja> hello Joy!
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|phone: lol, dat kick :P
<mitamaking> Does Flutter even do dual episodes?
<Reikim> I don't like using the ignore command.
<cachi01|phone> Klumzeedragon oh yeah i remember
<Joy> :)
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: No, i'm done debating. Thank you for the stimulating conversation.
<Reikim> Having an entire section of a convo cut out really isn't productive.
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: I challenge ye!
<Reikim> It's better to know he's there, even if it annoys me.
<Bronysith> d+
<cachi01|phone> twilight_sprinkle freaking fight club
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: lol, ending on saying "youre opinion is horrible" mkay, nice job there

<Panda|Drawing> cachi01|phone rule 1 of fight club... THERE IS NO FIGHT CLUB!!!!!!
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: Try this.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i don't understand your logic behind that but ok
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: Your argument for your opinion is horrible, not your opinion
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|phone: fighт club

<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: I just can't figure out why you don't like Fluttershy, and you haven't justified yourself yet. It's your opinion, and your entitled to it. I'm sorry for bothering you.
<Panda|Drawing> ok who programed the kickbot to kick when people say fought club
<cachi01|phone> yay bf finally loaded
<DashWithRainbows> Panda|Drawing It's only a small script for BMN, as a joke.
<nerf_soldier> mitamaking: the photo finish episode?
<HoodyNinja> Panda|Drawing: Sumica
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: i thought i explained why?..
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i see kick bot have a new command
<Panda|Drawing> DashWithRainbows i know XD
<DashWithRainbows> So just refrain from saying Fight club.
<Reikim> What is it?
<mitamaking> nerf_soldier: There you go, that is a dual episode too
<Panda|Drawing> HoodyNinja O_o Sumica knows how to code?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> fight club
<Panda|Drawing> Nife, what competition?
<HoodyNinja> Panda|Drawing: He was talking about it... not really sure
<Reikim> :fight club
<mitamaking> Was that one about Flutter overcoming shyness
<Reikim> Nothing.
<Panda|Drawing> HoodyNinja... he better not have been holding out on me -___-
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: I told you.
<Snowflake> s rthat plantside
<Panda|Drawing> Nife no you didnt.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> in mane chat no ":"
<mitamaking> Twillight was a bit anal in that one too
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: You didn't justify yourself
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle SPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINKLE
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: I did; a drawing compeititon.
<Klumzeedragon> So the kick bot is running on the FC word?
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: i did. she has too many eps that are too similar, and shes very overrated and the meanest one in mane 6
<Panda|Drawing> Nife uh... ok? ^^ I'd rather do an art trade if interested :3
*twilight_sprinkle jumps at Panda|Drawing and begins to NOMZ
<Panda|Drawing> ^^
<SpeedyBolt> wait
*Panda|Drawing is nommed on
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: No man, it's a competition.
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: You wanna talk about overrated ponies, talk about Twilight
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle how are you hun?
<SpeedyBolt> Hi everypony, i'm back from school :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you get kick for saying it lol
<HoodyNinja> till then, i suggest you drop it
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: I am up to 4 and a half epsidoes, not too much, simular, yeah..., but so are Applerjack's 1 episdoe
<cachi01|phone> Hi SpeedyBolt :)
<AJIsAwesome> SpeedyBolt: Hi. :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya SpeedyBolt
<Panda|Drawing> Nife well... Im not very competative... what do you have in mind?
<mitamaking> :p
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: why does every fluttershy fan always have to turn it into a twilight conversation
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: Cutest scootaloo ever.
<SafariMonkey> Oight SpeedyBolt
<Reikim> fight club
<mitamaking> *episode
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> in mane chat
<Panda|Drawing> Nife xD time limit?
<Snowflake> is this the beta>
<Snowflake> >
<Snowflake> ?
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: It's your name
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: Pinkie Pie*
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: 2 days
<Joy> What is he playing?
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: why cant the conversation be about sprinkels then :<
<Panda|Drawing> Nife are you... serious about this? ive never been chalenged before :s
<Reikim> I see BP got a command that'll let me leave this room in style from now on.
<DashWithRainbows> twilight_sprinkle Why does every Fluttershy fan freak the hell out when you say you /really/ hate her?
<SafariMonkey> Joy: Planetside 2
<SpeedyBolt> Equestrian Shooter 3
<Snowflake> Planetside 2
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: Show me your art.
<Reikim> After all, as everyone knows, you don't talk about fight club.
<Panda|Drawing> wait wait wait DashWithRainbows... who are you? O_o
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: because then somepony might get hungry and try to eat you?
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: Attack someone's favorite pony and expect a debate
<Snowflake> but is it the beta right?
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: aha, ive never said that.
<SpeedyBolt> Nobody should hate Fluttershy.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> about the*
<HoodyNinja> ^
<SafariMonkey> Snowflake: yh
<cachi01|phone> Panda do Some you know..... R 33 + 1
<Snowflake> ok thank you
<DashWithRainbows> Too bad SpeedyBolt, I do.
<twilight_sprinkle> i said a billion times i dont hate her, just think shes overrated
<Panda|Drawing> Nife search "xtheagilepanda" on deviant art.
<SpeedyBolt> and you dont HATE her.
<SpeedyBolt> You just really dislike her.
<Snowflake> very nice looking
<mitamaking> The problem isn't that Flutter has too many episodes, it's that it seems the lottery picks 2-3 a month
<SafariMonkey> Panda|Drawing: Advertising?
<HoodyNinja> You act like you hate her
<DashWithRainbows> Excuse me but are you trying to tell ME what I hate?
<Herostar> what is this game?
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: why cant people be objective...
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: Search on "KnifeH" on DA for me.
<Snowflake> i wonder if my computer couyld run if my computer runs bf3 on low
<Reikim> :P
<Reikim> \
<SpeedyBolt> Besides, everypony you hate at first, you'll learn to love
<Reikim> Dammit! Twitchy fingers.
<DashWithRainbows> Panda|Drawing I'm just your average slice of talking toast.
<SpeedyBolt> I used to hate Rarity, now I love her.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sooo what is arguments about ?
<DashWithRainbows> SpeedyBolt Wrong.
<cachi01|phone> Nife wait... U DRAW DAT SCOOTALOO?
<mitamaking> Look I hate :D a lot, but people like her, I get it
<DashWithRainbows> Absolutly wrong.
<Panda|Drawing> cachi01|phone been there, done that.
<SpeedyBolt> Well I tried.
<SpeedyBolt> So give me effort for that.
<Nife> cachi01|phone: Which one of them?
<DashWithRainbows> I do congratulate you for the effort.
<Panda|Drawing> DashWithRainbows can... I hug you? and when did you get voiced?
<DashWithRainbows> So, well done for trying.
<Reikim> About trying to get the butthurt out of mane.
<SpeedyBolt> Thank you, Good Sir/Madam
<Reikim> In retrospect, pointless.
<cachi01|phone> Nife the one u Linked and i said it was applebloom lulz
<HoodyNinja> I love everypony. Except Chrysalis
<Nife> cachi01|phone: Yes, durh
<DashWithRainbows> I'm male, and you're very welcome. I'll admit, you're not that bad of a person SpeedyBolt.
<mitamaking> HoodyNinja: Do you like her minions?
<HoodyNinja> mitamaking: Their alright
<cachi01|phone> Nife fucking awesome
<SpeedyBolt> You're not bad yourself, DashWithRainbows.
<Unnr> twilight_sprinkle: You are asking a group of fans to be rational and objective over the source of their fandom...
<DashWithRainbows> You should see me when it's summer.
<Snowflake> get in some vecs!!! man
<Panda|Drawing> Nife :/ you are so much better than me :s
<Reikim> Manechat's going to be butthurt as long as there are people on it to be butthurt.
<SpeedyBolt> Guys
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: So challenge accepted?
<DashWithRainbows> I'm a douche during that time.
<mitamaking> Now you want to talk overrated, let us speak of a certain background pony that is considered great and powerful
<Reikim> Unnr: For a certain value of rational and objective.
<twilight_sprinkle> Unnr: oh life, y u suck so much :<
<cachi01|phone> mitamaking colgate?
<mitamaking> cachi01|phone: close
*Reikim makes siren noise
<SafariMonkey> Panda|Drawing: I don't like the content so much, but he style's nice
<cachi01|phone> derpy?
<cachi01|phone> Jelly pony?
<twilight_sprinkle> point is, rarity needs more episodes!
<mitamaking> Is Colgate a canon name?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> As long as there is people on it.
<HoodyNinja> mitamaking: Cheerilee?
<Reikim> They're about to start up the Trixie butthurt.
<Unnr> Reikim: First rule of fandom, objective behavior has no place within the bounds of the community. Attempts to prove otherwise will result in the wrath of angry fen.
<DashWithRainbows> Panda|Drawing Hugs? Not a huge fan of them, unless you are next to me in person then sure. As for being voiced, I've been like this for a couple weeks now.
<Reikim> I'm stuck between revulsion and a strange kind of frustrated amusement.
<cachi01|phone> mitamaking nope or else they get sued the shit out of them
<HoodyNinja> He's taking lessons from Caramel
<mitamaking> I like Cheerilee, I want an episode with her in the past with the hairdo and some of the parents
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he he i laugh every time the chat starts talking about Trixie
<Panda|Drawing> DashWithRainbows for give me... I dont frequent bstate much anymore :s
<Barbetos|AtWork> mitamaking: but trixie is a antagonist, not a background pony.
<Herostar> was i the only one to catch the jelly pony as a troll?
<mitamaking> Barbetos|AtWork: For now.....
<Snowflake> i dont like the hands waving all around
<Reikim> Honestly, the split over Trixie is worse than the many fractured divides in the Final Fantasy fandom.
<cachi01|phone> Herostar as a troll?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mostly because almost everyone there love Fannon Trixie
<SafariMonkey> OK I gotta go bed. Night guys
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: you der?
<mitamaking> Speaking of unliked ponies, does any one not like Pinkie?
<cachi01|phone> Night safari :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight SafariMonkey
<Dovah> night SafariMonkey
<Panda|Drawing> Nife... I.... am honored.... truly.... ive never been chalenged, let alone by a really good artist such as yourself... I... might need more time than 2 days, considering you have a tablet and I have a mouse >.>
<Reikim> Actually, correction.
<mitamaking> I have never met one soul
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: Night! :)
<Herostar> cachi01|phone yes, as in a troll referance, more commonly "U JELLY
<cachi01|phone> mitamaking but....pinkie is best pony
<Unnr> mitamaking: I don't particularly care for pinkie
<Reikim> The split over Fanon!Trixie has the fans in knots.
<DashWithRainbows> Panda|Drawing Your actions do not require for me to forgive you, seeing that you have done nothing wrong. During the summer, I barely talked on BState since I knew I would snap at people, amongst other things.
<cachi01|phone> Herostar ooh lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: for now
<Snowflake> get a vec!
<Reikim> There's the problem there. The fanon.
<Unnr> She reminds me far too much of an old flatmate
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: She can be particularyly annoying sometimes, but I don't mind.
<nerf_soldier> TACO GREASE!!!:[
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: It's for fun :p
<Reikim> But then, that's the universal problem.
<Klumzeedragon> cachi01|phone: Ah ha! I got it downloaded and everything. :P Time to play some new maps.
<mitamaking> AJIsAwesome: The donkey episode?
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: so whats wrong with your story submission?
<Herostar> 'troll pony IS cannon, and that was him, and i was the only one to catch it v_v
<Reikim> The whole "my fanon is correct and any other is wrong" thing.
<sub06905> ello everypony :)
<SafariMonkey> g'night MLP_Brovakiin cachi01|phone Dovah AJIsAwesome
<Panda|Drawing> DashWithRainbows well.. I would never make you snap at me ^^, I hope... I mean... I try to be a good pony.
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: Yeah. Especially that one. :D
<Nife> What's with this C&C or RA music.
<SafariMonkey> Hi/Bye sub06905
<Nife> It makes me pumped
<cachi01|phone> Klumzeedragob mine is downloading right now :) damn 1.56 GB
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: Hi! :)
<Panda|Drawing> Nife okies ^^ but who would be the judge?
<Snowflake> omfg big map
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello sub06905 :)
<mitamaking> AJIsAwesome: But it had Smile Smile Smile :P
<nerf_soldier> so much blue
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: Ze community
<TheKoreanBrony1354> planet side 2
<Herostar> what game is dis?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Thats not a map. Its a projection of a political campaign.
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: I like the song, but it's a little overrated.
<Panda|Drawing> Nife bstate?
<sub06905> what game is this? it reminds me so much of Battlefield 3
<Nife> Herostar: Tetris
<Snowflake> red sucks
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> sum that up in one line: "Stop liking things i don't like*
<cachi01|phone> sub planetside
<Snowflake> lol
<DoctoDoctorWho> It says I need to have at least 1 published chapter and at least 1000 words across all chapters to submit my story
<Herostar> Nife :|
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: bstate?
<mitamaking> Snowflake: Red is best color
<HoodyNinja> Well, my friend just called me, i gtg. Laters
<Barbetos|AtWork> sub06905: its Plantside 2
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: Bye. :)
<Nife> Herostar: Halo, of course.
<cachi01|phone> Nife tetris in the year 492702929
<Snowflake> mitamaking no lolz thats him
<HoodyNinja> cachi01|phone: :D
<MadSurge> Night people, see you tomorrow!
<sub06905> tnx
<Reikim> More or less.
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: then do that?
<DoctoDoctorWho> wait, I think I see the problem
<Snowflake> jk
<Herostar> Nife :S
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Night! :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight MadSurge
<Panda|Drawing> Nife considering you have near 200k page views and I barely met 2k views... I think you'd win by default on Bstate.
<DoctoDoctorWho> brb
<Snowflake> omg so big
<Reikim> Yes I know I can be hypocritical about that sometimes, but I try to avoid it.
<mitamaking> AJIsAwesome: So I guess for you and everypony, Best song(in befor This Day Aria flood)
<Reikim> Tis a tragedy of fandom~
<Snowflake> get a vec
<Panda|Drawing> Nife I mean, on DA
*Reikim plays a sad song on violin
<Barbetos|AtWork> Thats what she sa! *shot*
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: Bstate is filled with beef.
<Nife> I like it.
<Nife> Which is why I wanna apply for streaming (drawing) :D
<DashWithRainbows> Panda|Drawing It wouldn't be your fault, it would be mine. Summer time for me is when you do not want to talk to me without a honest opinion, no matter how harsh it may be. I'd also swear a lot and be a douche to everyone. Talking to me in Spring is similar, but is very mild compared to it. Talking to me during Fall and Winter is when I'm relaxed and will be less likely to jump down your
<DashWithRainbows> throat when talking.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nah Nife that is BEEFState.
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: I like the song by itself, I don't like the excessive remixes of it.
<twilight_sprinkle> yus, this day aria is best song :3
<mitamaking> Art of the Dress 4EVER
<Joy> How is everypony?
<AJIsAwesome> Joy: Hi! :)
<twilight_sprinkle> art of the dress was nice too
*AJIsAwesome doesn't have a favorite song.
<twilight_sprinkle> its...nice
<mitamaking> Joy: Enjoying no school
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good thanks Joy, how are you?
*Cades[Phone] is the best
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm bored
<sub06905> BBBFF <3
<Reikim> 'gratz. I am too.
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<mitamaking> BBBFF?
<Panda|Drawing> Nife... you would be a better candidate than me....
*DoctoDoctorWho AJIsAwesome doesnt, but DoctoDoctorWho does
<mitamaking> :)
<Snowflake> tank'
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: Cause I'm a mad person.
<Herostar> POP A CAP IN THEIR ASS STREAMER :[ sorry i get that army sense for these games...
<Barbetos|AtWork> Suddenly magrider
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you seem a bit upset
<Reikim> I've solved it semi-temporarily by whining into chat while simultaneously trying to wade through some betareading.
<Snowflake> look at you map for them wwhen they shoot
<sub06905> who is streaming anyways?
<Panda|Drawing> DashWithRainbows ok ^^ I... I'll keep the pings to a minimum.
<mitamaking> sub06905: I think it is Wrek
<Panda|Drawing> Nife though I'm curious... noone here has talked to you abut your work? O_o
<cachi01|phone> I have
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: I fixed it, now me just wait for approval by the site(trololololol:D)
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: Which work?
<cachi01|phone> And its fucking awesome
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: I got 31k on a speedpaint on youtube
<Joy> :)
*Nife insinuating famousness
<DashWithRainbows> Panda|Drawing No need to worry about pings. If you have played Halo Reach and used the Sniper, you will now know that that particular sound is my ping sound.
<thelonepony> AAA YEAH!
<Herostar> shooter don't care wrek, everyone goes to honeybadgermode in game :P
<LadyCanary> Wrek still streaming?
<DashWithRainbows> so imagine that at some foresaken hour in the morning, completely out of the blue.
<AJIsAwesome> LadyCanary: Yep.
<Nife> LadyCanary: Wrek never streams, he sleeps and he glues the tablet pen to his forehead.
<Panda|Drawing> Nife... you... kinda make me feel... bad :/
<LadyCanary> XD Ha.
<AJIsAwesome> Nife: :D
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: Wat
<LadyCanary> I see he is enjoying himself, dat Wrek ^_^
<Reikim> Oi, there's a canary in chat.
<Snowflake> ya tank!
<mitamaking> I don't know who is streaming honestly, I thought I read earlier it was Wrek
<LadyCanary> Tweet tweet! :3
<MLP_Brovakiin> I best be off now, I have been falling asleep in class again :P Goodnight everyone :)
*Reikim waves his arms frantically to ward it off
<LadyCanary> D;

<sub06905> night MLP_Brovakiin
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Night! :)
<LadyCanary> Wahhh.
<Nife> mitamaking: Well, it most likely is, cause he's been ignoring my 250= messages
<Snowflake> on top
<Nife> +
<thelonepony> night MLP_Brovakiin
<Unnr> nife and Panda|Drawing, if you want to do a challenge and want votes as opposed to a selected panel of judges, draw images and then make a surveymonkey survey, the basic (ie. free) account should be able to do a simple, Which is Better, A or B type question.
*Reikim catches the canary in a net and puts it carefully back in its snuggly cage
<Reikim> There. Phew.
<LadyCanary> Wah! Get me outa the cage!
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs sub06905, AJIsAwesome, thelonepony <3
<DashWithRainbows> I have a plan.
<Reikim> Loose birds in small places make me frantic.
<Joy> I need to go, guys.
<thelonepony> i wub Hugs :3
<Unnr> Reikim: Whyyy did you cage the Canary? You fool!
<LadyCanary> ;3; But I wont hurt you, Reikim
<Nife> Panda|Drawing: Stop feeling bad.
*Reikim is now repentant
*DashWithRainbows steals LadyCanary and puts her on the shoulder of ShizuPyro
<thelonepony> bye Joy
<Reikim> Go free, canary~

<Reikim> Also: game's F2P
<otakon> this is F2P?
<Derpy_Hooves> http://derpy.me/ykqqZ http://derpy.me/bTvdl
<Reikim> You can't make a console F2P game.
<otakon> you can
<cachi01|phone> Reikim happy wars
<Reikim> Yeah, I just looked it up. The final product will be F2P.
<otakon> but not on Xbox360

<JRPhone> Moo
<cachi01|phone> its not released yet
<otakon> wait

<Nittany_Discord> My game cynicism levels are dropping.
<otakon> which means...IT COULD COME TO THE PS3!
<cachi01|phone> WAIT WUT?
<otakon> there is a VERY strong possiblity this could be on the PS3
<Reikim> otakon: Hahahahahaha no.
<Meanwhile> Could, but won't.
<cachi01|phone> Reikim.hahahhaha maybe
<Reikim> Sorry to pop your bubble, friend.
<otakon> Reikim: what do you mean no? Dust 514, MAG, DC Online.
<Reikim> But nope.
<otakon> Reikim: plus it's published by Sony Online Entertainment
<otakon> if this does well enough on PC, they'll find a way to port it
<cachi01|phone> this WILL do well enough
<Petrified_Discord> It's certainly very shiny
<sub06905> this game looks like a combo of Battlefield 3 and Halo :D
<otakon> nah
<cachi01|phone> eww.....

<otakon> which I liked
<Wrek> 05section 8 meets battlefield

<Dark_Horst> otakon: you might wanna optimize your current situation
*otakon is disintegrated into a small pile of white ash.
<Petrified_Discord> I wonder if we can port otakon to console? I like this game a lot.
*AJIsAwesome uses Phoenix Down on otakons_ashes
<Reikim> Hey look, the chat just got a bit cleaner.
<otakons_ashes> ...(goddammit)

<Dark_Horst> Petrified_Discord: console couldnt ahndle the dimensions

<Petrified_Discord> sub06905: Can somone say kamikaze? :D
*Ryunosuke wants to get into an abbadon class battleship and start perfoming orbital strikes
<Ryunosuke> I win :)
<sub06905> Petrified_Discord: yes :D
<Dark_Horst> you do realize that kamikaze pilots in MP are scum, right?
<otakons_ashes> ...(goddammit. at least Nittany_Discord isn't dusting right now)
<Petrified_Discord> Dark_Horst: But AC-130 kamikaze pilots are heroes
<AJIsAwesome> otakons_ashes: Yep.
<AJIsAwesome> *Yet*
<CCCP> otakons_ashes but its more complicated than that! :(
<cachi01|phone> Being a kamikaze in MP is useless
<Dark_Horst> the only thing lower in the food chain would be a hacker
<cachi01|phone> Butt fun
<Nittany_Discord> No dusting from me for a while.
<Dark_Horst> Petrified_Discord: wut?
<otakons_ashes> ...( CCCP how so? go do your homework, eat and come back. That simple)
<CCCP> otakons_ashes fine
*cachi01|phone gives feather duster 2000 to Nittany_Discord
*Reikim dusts otakons_ashes, scattering them to the four winds
<Reikim> There. That worked out pretty well, if I do say so myself.

<Petrified_Discord> otakons_ashes_in_an_: You should try http://www.downloadmoreram.com/
<Dark_Horst> otakons_ashes_in_an_: whats the minimum system rquirements for thsi?

<Reikim> Petrified_Discord: Oh you troll.
<AJIsAwesome> *candy*
<sub06905> twilight_sprinkle: comes up to a total of $77.57 or GBP 53.53
<Kandarihu_> I hope this isn't Crysis tier.
<Petrified_Discord> Reikim: Sometimes I wonder: Is Metroid's machine gun a part of his arm or his armor?
*Lavagirl6414 smiles
<Reikim> :P
<RanbowDash90> marf what we talking about
<Dark_Horst> Petrified_Discord: i hope you're being sarcastic
<Reikim> I can't even get mad at that it's so silly.

<cachi01|phone> Hi icybeauti :)
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Kawaii_icybeauti
<Kawaii_icybeauti> hey thelonepony twilight_sprinkle
<Dark_Horst> Petrified_Discord: otherwise i'd have to kill you right about now
<Kandarihu_> Petrified_Discord, the metroid is a jellyfish-like alien. It doesn't have a machine gun.
<sub06905> twilight_sprinkle: pretty cheap compared to $150+
<Kawaii_icybeauti> It's weird, it's 9/11 and all that stuff, and I lived in NY at the time, and I don't remember it at all...I was 3 BTW.
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905 yea. altho ive found a few around 50ish, smaller tho
<Petrified_Discord> Kandarihu_: You see? BEST troll question XD
<Nittany_Discord> I remember 9/11. I was in tech college.
<Dark_Horst> i somewhat expected it
<cachi01|phone> Icybeauti i was 3 at the time also
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I feel young o.O
<twilight_sprinkle> Kawaii_icybeauti: i remember drawing a picture of it in kindergartden. my teacher wasnt happy :P
<Dark_Horst> ....but i was also looking forward to bloody murder
<Nittany_Discord> 9/11 was supposed to be a good day since there was no lab to attend. Nope. Terrorist attack.
<Lavagirl6414> I was 2 when 9/11 happened.
<Kandarihu_> Petrified_Discord, and neither does Samus Aran, the character that you play as in the Metroid games. She has a modifiable energy cannon that fits over her hand. It's part of her armor.
<cachi01|phone> Im 14 yay
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I do remember being 3, and I remember living at my old house and all that, but just that day....It's not there.
<twilight_sprinkle> i think i was like 6 or so, not sure
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu_: i htink he's bullshitiing7
<Petrified_Discord> Kandarihu_: And other M is an anagram for Mother :O
<Kandarihu_> Petrified_Discord, I'm not raging. Isn't that the whole point of trolling?
<cachi01|phone> Kandarihu wait. SHE?? Metroid is a woman? WUUUUT?
<JunkerKun> Hmmm... I was like... 9 or so
<Kawaii_icybeauti> And I even had a friend of my dad's come back to the house covered in debris.
<Petrified_Discord> Kandarihu_: Naw, someone brought up trolling and it was a reply to that :P
<Freefall29> Petrified_Discord: lol
<Kandarihu> Petrified_Discord, I see.
<Petrified_Discord> Killed by: gun
<Reikim> 9/11...I have vague memories of that.
<Petrified_Discord> :|
<cachi01|phone> Icybeauti how can you remember all of that? I cant remember a shit O_o my mom said i was jumping around the house while she was watching the news lulz
<Derpy_Hooves> http://imgur.com/l9qWh
<Polydunami> Okay, I'm back.
<Freefall29> man, I totally forgot todays 9/11....
<Petrified_Discord> Reload while dying. Love it.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> cachi01|phone: No, my mom tells me that. I don't remember the day at all.
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: :D

<JunkerKun> Freefall29 Russia
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: only on one side of the globe^^
<cachi01|phone> Fun fact: seth mcfarlane was supposed to go in.one.of the planes but he missed it
<Kawaii_icybeauti> inb4 soviet russia jokes.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: true, the other side has epxerienced things a loooot worse
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: yep. those battles are nonstop
<Lavagirl6414> :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: you mean the maps dont end?
<Dark_Horst> that'S what i mean
<twilight_sprinkle> well thats kinda pointless then
<Kawaii_icybeauti> JunkerKun: Since your from russia..I have 1 question...Is the winter as brutal as they say it is?
<Dark_Horst> leat thats what wrek told us
<Reikim> Stuck on 2fort foreverrrrr. A fate worse than death.
<cachi01|phone> In mother russia bronystate chats on you
<Petrified_Discord> Reikim: Especially since you keep respawning :P
*Ponies47 Appears outta no where

<Ponies47> Petrified_Discord: Then giggle at the Ponies47 next time I guess :P
*Freefall29 shoots Ponies47.... sorry man, I thought you were a mugger. ya scared me.
<cachi01|phone> Dead guy? Tbag!
*Ponies47 Respawns
<Dark_Horst> Kawaii_icybeauti: minus 40C. whent hey want to start up the car in the morning, they have to light a fire nder the engine to thaw it up first. that's why it's easier to leave it running overnight
<JunkerKun> Kawaii_icybeauti you like snow?
<Ponies47> Freefall29: What was that for? D:
<twilight_sprinkle> snow is nice, ice is a b**ch
<Freefall29> Ponies47: it was a reflex reaction. you know how bad crime is these days.
*Bronysith puts twilight_sprinkle in a box
*Bronysith puts Reikim in a mech
<Kawaii_icybeauti> JunkerKun: Yeah, it's not only fun, but you get a free day off from school.
<Ponies47> Freefall29: Good point
<JunkerKun> Dark_Horst well, there are warm summers in Siberia =)
<Reikim> I was disappointed in winter this year. Barely got any days below thirty.
<Petrified_Discord> Ponies47: ...You respawn? FREE XP!
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: but i have claustrophobia D:
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Reikim: IKR?

<Dark_Horst> JunkerKun: that too. pretty extreme weather there
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: They had those at BFF. :$
<Reikim> Kawaii_icybeauti: Usually up here we get like a week or two of below -30 days. And this year...nothing. It sucked.
<Freefall29> dinner guys. brb.
<Dark_Horst> Reikim: you talkinf C or F there?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: *doesnt actually have claustrophobia*
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: Try to, though. They're pretty fun to use.
<Petrified_Discord> I think time might be running out
<Reikim> Dark_Horst: Celsius, of course. Fahrenheit...*shudders*
<JunkerKun> Kawaii_icybeauti oh. I don't like winters actually. But there is a chance to play snow fight, so, I guess, I can live with it =)
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Reikim: It was Janurary 7th, my mom's bday, and it was 63 muthabucking degrees out.
<Nittany_Discord> Talk in K or R and win!
<Reikim> ...
<twilight_sprinkle> fahrenheit, inches, yards, feet. they suck. metric system all the way
<Lavagirl6414> Hi, Bronysith!

<Reikim> Is everyone else talking in Fahrenheit?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I want to the learn the metric system..I feel like a hipster.
<AJIsAwesome> in K or R
<cachi01|phone> Here in mexico we use metric system
<JunkerKun> @Nittany_Discord, gawd. I can't imagine 30 Kelvins O_o
<sub06905> AJIsAwesome: i hope to do this soon :$ http://derpy.me/ojriT
<Kawaii_icybeauti> BTW, I'm in F.
<Reikim> Metric system is BEST SYSTEM.
<Dark_Horst> Kawaii_icybeauti: you feel like a hipster becasue you want to use metric?
<Petrified_Discord> America should switch to metric TIME so we have nothing in common with the rest of the world XD
<sub06905> also Dat Ponies47 :3
<cachi01|phone> Reikim./)
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dark_Horst: No, cause I don't know it.

<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: Same here. WIsh I had a car of my own. :$
<twilight_sprinkle> people actually managed to create below 1 kelvin in a lab iirc
<Dark_Horst> Kawaii_icybeauti: that relieves me^^
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: We recently dropped down to about 283 K. Winter is coming.
<Reikim> cachi01|phone: (\
<JunkerKun> twilight_sprinkle, wut? Why?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> US is hipster in lots of ways..customary system...no free health care...
<twilight_sprinkle> JunkerKun: to observe a quantum phenomenon that occurs only at that temperatre
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: So I guess you could say it's....*puts sunglasses on*...........Autumn Wrap-up?
<Petrified_Discord> Kawaii_icybeauti: Mother of god...
<Lavagirl6414> :)
*Reikim gives AJIsAwesome the deadest of stares
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome: I prefer Fuck-Off Fall myself
<twilight_sprinkle> JunkerKun: lower temperature also can prove opportunities for other things, like superconductors
<AJIsAwesome> :$
<JunkerKun> twilight_sprinkle, I tell you, someday we're all gonna die because of one big black hole made in lab -__-
<cachi01|phone> Petrified_Discord Lol
<otakon> brb gotta clean up the kitchen
<AJIsAwesome> Petrified_Discord: :D
<Reikim> JunkerKun: And I'll tell you right now they can't do it.
<twilight_sprinkle> JunkerKun: maybe, maybe, but we all gotaa die some time :D
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Petrified_Discord: Ikr..
<cachi01|phone> Will the great hydron collider kill us all?
<cachi01|phone> NOPE
<Reikim> No. It won't.
<twilight_sprinkle> hydron collider broke iirc
<JunkerKun> Reikim, well, that's a relief =)
<Kawaii_icybeauti> And we spend 99.9% of our money on a war!
<Dark_Horst> JunkerKun: the only black holes we can create have the energy of a mosquito and do much, much less damage. namely none
<cachi01|phone> icybeauti sounds like.me in black ops....
<twilight_sprinkle> lol cachi01|phone
<Reikim> Jeez, if only people would quit fretting about the LHC and worry about, you know., the current fucked-up state of the world.
<Petrified_Discord> Along with Shuffle-Off Spring and Shut-Up Summer
<Dark_Horst> JunkerKun: the only way to create a serious black hole would be a hydrogen bomb the size of texas
<Kawaii_icybeauti> :D I gotta go set the table, be back in 10 seconds flat.
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim: "the music makes us forget!"
<Dark_Horst> directly into the sun
<SpeedyBolt> Hey guys, guess what? :3
<cachi01|phone> black hole sun
<Reikim> Dark_Horst: Would it? I thought the sun isn't big enough. You need something like three solar masses.
<cachi01|phone> SpeedyBolt Obama?!
<SpeedyBolt> Yolo :$
<SpeedyBolt> -runs-
<Petrified_Discord> cachi01|phone: Superman 4 logic
<JunkerKun> Dark_Horst, well, if they ever create a bomb this big, we will die just from the look at it
<Ponies47> Who's streaming? Wrek?
<cachi01|phone> GET OVER HERE DAMMIT
<twilight_sprinkle> i forgot what yolo is
<Dark_Horst> Reikim: even better. that way nobody will get the idea to build a hydrogen bomb the size of texas
<SpeedyBolt> That is offically my new troll word.
<twilight_sprinkle> whats yolo again?
<cachi01|phone> You only listen once
<Polydunami> You only live once.
<Reikim> JunkerKun: He's messing with you. We literally cannot create a proper black hole with the resources available to us. Our sun isn't even big enough to go supernova.
<Ponies47> twilight_sprinkle: Dumbest word ever next to swag :|
<cachi01|phone> ^ me at school
<twilight_sprinkle> lol cachi01|phone
<Polydunami> *never, cachi01|phone :P
<Petrified_Discord> You only lie outwardly
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01|phone: you are now dumbest word
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: yolo is something dumb people say before doing dumb things. it'S carpe diem for retards
<Reikim> Yordles only lane o
<twilight_sprinkle> Ponies47: agreed about swag
<cachi01|phone> Yay im dumbest word!
<cachi01|phone> BUCK YEAH
<Reikim> *Yordles only lane overtly
<thelonepony> http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-its-about-time-yolo-had-a-better-definition.png
<Polydunami> Whoa
<thelonepony> yolo definition^
<JunkerKun> Reikim, huh? I'm not good at physics but isn't sun going to become supernova after Red Giant stage?
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: sometimes the internet confuses me o.o
<cachi01|phone> thelonepony LOL
<AJIsAwesome> Only YOLO acronym I accept: You Obviously Love Octavia.
<Polydunami> You'd better quit smoking; YOLO.
<Reikim> JunkerKun: It's not big enough. You need a much bigger sun than ours for that. No, ours will just collapse in on itself to form a white dwarf, and then slowly cool off into a large mass of...stuff. I can't remember what, exactly. Might be iron, nickel...some kind of metal.
<twilight_sprinkle> YO LOL
<Polydunami> Either way, JunkerKun, we'd be doomed.
<twilight_sprinkle> sammich tiem
<Petrified_Discord> YODO. You only die once
<JunkerKun> Reikim, oh. Meh, I won't live long enough to see that
<cachi01|phone> you better be ready before we go to a long trip YOCO
<Saturn> 08,01evening all
<Reikim> Petrified_Discord: UNLESS you're in Dragonball Z.
<cachi01|phone> hi Saturn :)
<thelonepony> hi Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i'm tipsy and tired
<Dark_Horst> Reikim: probably nickel. that stuff is everywhere
<Bronysith> hey Saturn
<Meanwhile> Allo Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01and also at work
<Polydunami> Been a while, Saturn.
<Wrek> 05hi saturn
<twilight_sprinkle> i think ill start adding yolo after everything i say now; yolo
<sub06905> ello Saturn
<Ponies47> Hey Saturn
<Wrek> 05i heard LadyCanary told you? :D
<LadyCanary> Saturn!!!
<Dark_Horst> SATURN! jsut the man we need
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Saturn> :P
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: she did!
<Reikim> Hey, Saturn. Haven't seen you in a while.
<LadyCanary> :333333
<JunkerKun> Well, gonna get some sleep. Bye everyone!
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: and ZOMG ADORABLE <3333
<Petrified_Discord> Reikim: Someone made me watch that. I still don't get why they get all upset when someone dies. They can just find a way to bring them back :P
<cachi01|phone> night JunkerKun :)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey guys im back,got some hotdogs for chili dogs :$
<Saturn> 08,01my warmest wishes, to both of you!
<thelonepony> bye Junker
<AJIsAwesome> JunkerKun: Night! :)
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: you dont ahppen to know what will be left of our sun after it cooled off?
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Nice! :)
<thelonepony> wb Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Kawaii_icybeauti> kay I'm back....
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: i do, actually
<SpeedyBolt> Saturn is still alive?! Halleujah
<Shamroc> hiya Saturn~
<LadyCanary> <3 Saturn <3
<thelonepony> wb Kawaii_icybeauti
<Reikim> Petrified_Discord: DBZA lampshaded it wonderfully. "Oh no! Goku's about to die?" "...So?"
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: enlighten us!
<Shamroc> ^
<cachi01|phone> G2G guys back in 2 hours
<cachi01|phone> CYA!
*Reikim is waiting for enlightenment
<thelonepony> bye cachi01|phone
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Uggghhh...I have tumbling tomorrow....:|
<Saturn> 08,01gimme a sec to deal with work stuff
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What is this game anyway?
<Dark_Horst> alrighty then
<thelonepony> Tumbling?
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[R]: planetside 2 beta
<Ryunosuke> hey saturn, and LadyCanary
<Lavagirl6414> :)
<Kawaii_icybeauti> thelonepony: You know, learning how to do flips for cheerleading.
<cachi01|phone> Tumbling lulz
<Reikim> The canary's been fluttering around chat for a while now...
<Saturn> 08,01so okay
<thelonepony> Kawaii_icybeauti: oh!
<Saturn> 08,01first our sun will actually expand
<Saturn> 08,01into a red giant
<Shamroc> new that
<Shamroc> knew*
<Saturn> 08,01the nuclear reactions in the middle will stop
<Petrified_Discord> And then we'll be all nice and toasty
<Shamroc> and earth goes poof
<Saturn> 08,01so actually, the core will shrink, but the outer layers will expand
<Kawaii_icybeauti> But it isn't really that. It's more of a random-being-made-to-do-useless-excerises-thing. We get to the actual learning when we're all exhausted.
<Freefall29> i'm back everypony
<Lavagirl6414> :)
<thelonepony> wb Freefall29
<AJIsAwesome> Freefall29: Hi! :)
<Polydunami> Less mass will do that, Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01with little gravity to keep it together, the outer layers of the sun will then start to dissipate into space
<Saturn> 08,01this will create a nebula around the star
<Reikim> ...For whatever reason, that sounded really epic.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> So this is what 12/21/12 is going to be like?
<Reikim> "Dissipate into space~"
<Dark_Horst> Reikim: it probably will be
<Reikim> ...
<Saturn> 08,01a good chunk of the sun's mass will be lost to this nebula
<Reikim> Was that a tab fail?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> It's gonna be like it was on dr.who.
<sub06905> Celestia will kill us all
<Petrified_Discord> 12/21/12: When the Mayans switched to the metric system
<Shamroc> Kawaii_icybeauti. Saturn's talking about stuff millions of years into the fuure
<Wrek> 05but yeah Saturn, thansk for showing us your support ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01the sun will then cool and shrink into, i think, a white dwarf
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It wont be my problem then
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'll be LONG dead
<LadyCanary> Yes, thank you Saturn <3
<Polydunami> Make that billions, Shamroc.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Shamroc: In the year...what was it again...5 billion something apple?
<Freefall29> Kawaii_icybeauti: the temperatures will be around 60 degrees, mostly sunny, traffic will suck, and people will still be alive
<Shamroc> Kawaii_icybeauti: yeps
<GabeMoist> I'll still be alive to see the Sun be a white dwarf
<Polydunami> Billions and billions.
<Reikim> White dwarf. Yeah, I think I said that.
<Ryunosuke> lets blame the expanding sun on human intervention and global warming!
<Saturn> 08,01at this point it will be kinda tiny
<Ryunosuke> we do that anyway :)
<Kawaii_icybeauti> imagine if the sun turned into a black hole....
<GabeMoist> GabeMoists last forever
<Saturn> 08,01for a sun, that is
<NullRadix> Ryunosuke: yes, shift the blame to everyone, instead of just me
<Reikim> Kawaii_icybeauti: We'd all be dead long before that.
<Saturn> 08,01under 1000km in diameter
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: and after that one cools off?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Reikim: I know. But that would be pretty sweet if that happened.
<Polydunami> Bless you, Wrek
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: gesundheit
<Saturn> 08,01there's no more nuclear reactions at this point
<thelonepony> bless you Wrek
<Freefall29> I never knew the sun could spark such a conversation
<Meanwhile> Gesündheit.
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: after that, it becomes a black dwarf
<GabeMoist> In other news: Scientists have determined that the Sun is too round
<Saturn> 08,01after most of its heat has been radiated into space
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its shining a light on the subject
<Reikim> Black dwarf.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its quite illuminating
<Dark_Horst> ....i have a rather funny mental image right now
<Panda|Drawing> Saturn... you know WAY too much :3
<Freefall29> the sun is really hot right now
<Ryunosuke> black... dwarf?
<Saturn> 08,01at this point it's now dark, cold, and very small
<Reikim> So it's Meanwhile's soul?
<Ryunosuke> you mean a umm
<Freefall29> Saturn: how fast do you google this?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Reikim: :D
<GabeMoist> Soon, all the stars will become black dwarfs
<Saturn> 08,01Freefall29: i'm not googling it; i used to be an astrophysicist
<Meanwhile> Saw that coming a mile away Rei.
<Reikim> Good to know I've gotten predictable.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What do you mean used to? Why did you quit?
*NullRadix isn't saying it
<Saturn> 08,01SpadeMagnes[R]: i changed career to computer science
<Saturn> 08,01actually, i initially left because i wanted to be a musician
<GabeMoist> That's quite the change
<Freefall29> we got an astrophysicist for a brony.... the brony community just got 20% cooler
<Saturn> 08,01wanted to write film scores
<Dark_Horst> funny how that goes
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Nice to see this game fucking suprises you with what kills you
<Saturn> 08,01but then computer science seemed way more appealing
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Now we know what really goes on with luna n celestia.
<Saturn> 08,01so that's what i'm doing now
<Reikim> So black dwarf
<Reikim> Continue, Saturn?
<Panda|Drawing> Meanwhile doesnt have a soul Reikim...
<Dark_Horst> what will that one consist of?
<Polydunami> That's the end, Reikim.
<GabeMoist> Astronomy is my favorite science
<Freefall29> Panda|Drawing: why doesnt meanwhile have a soul?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> He traded it for ponies.
<Panda|Drawing> Freefall29 because he isnt human.
<Reikim> I remember hearing that it will turn into a big ball of some kind of metal.
<Lavagirl6414> :)
<Panda|Drawing> Kawaii_icybeauti!!! omg hi!
<Freefall29> Panda|Drawing: is he a robot?
*Kawaii_icybeauti glomps Panda|Drawing
<DerpDash> Hey Everypony!
<Reikim> Freefall29: He's a pony.
<Polydunami> Hey, DerpDash
*DerpDash hugz chat
<Panda|Drawing> Freefall29 no... he is... Meanwhile...
<thelonepony> hi DerpDash
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: which is ou core question
<GabeMoist> Reikim, I think it was iron?
<Panda|Drawing> Kawaii_icybeauti how have you been hun? ^^
<thelonepony> I <3 hugs! :3
<Petrified_Discord> Reikim: Then you lock a time lord inside of it.
<Wrek> 05really Bronysith was sthe only one who got saturns hint?
<Wrek> 05:P
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Panda|Drawing: Good, but busier due to school.
<Bronysith> Wrek: shrugpony
*LadyCanary giggles.
<Reikim> ...Hint?
<Meanwhile> What hint?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> hint of wut?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: WREK AND LADYCANARY ARE GOIING OUT
<Freefall29> my hint senses are not tingling
<Panda|Drawing> Kawaii_icybeauti same >.< I just want to finish a sketch before I head back for a term paper
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: we're not actually very sure what happens after that
<Saturn> 08,01that might be the final stage
<Reikim> ...Oh that. Yeah, that was pretty obvious from the conversation. I just didn't think it would be tactful to get involved.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> oh right the shipping btw the bronies. Panda|Drawing Lucky I'm a high school freshie. Not gonna die of work overload yet/
<Dark_Horst> scinec ehas abaondoned us
<Saturn> 08,01as it's really just a theoretical phenomena
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Anything could happen with it.
<Meanwhile> I probably wasn't looking at the time.
<Saturn> 08,01no black dwarves have been observed yet, and it's thought that none actually exist yet
<Polydunami> Wait, correct me if I'm wrong; do we have an engagement on our hands?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You seem to get blindsided easily in this game
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I bet the aliens are laughing as our theories right now.
<Panda|Drawing> Kawaii_icybeauti really? I thought you were older. ^^ ah, freshman year was awesome. well except for the bashing >.>
*LadyCanary spits out water.
<GabeMoist> Hold on, what's happening?
<Dovah> am i missig a great conversation about space?
<Petrified_Discord> Sun talk
<Panda|Drawing> Saturn wait... so they are a theory like black holes./
<LadyCanary> Oh goodness no, Polydunami XDDD
<Saturn> 08,01Kawaii_icybeauti: almost certainly
<Dark_Horst> i'd also imagine it pretty hard to observe somthing that dowsnt give off any light
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dovah: Eyup
<LadyCanary> Relationship, Polydunami
<GabeMoist> Saturn, well it would take a really long time to get to the black dwarf stage
<Freefall29> Dovah: space is serious business
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wrek no offense to your skill but you seem to be ending face down alot
<Saturn> 08,01Panda|Drawing: well, more of a theory than black holes, as black hole phenomena have actually been observed
<Polydunami> Well, I thought you were already in a relationship, LadyCanary
<Saturn> 08,01look up gravitational lensing
<LadyCanary> ...
<Polydunami> -_(\
<LadyCanary> Dude.
<GabeMoist> I'm so out of the loop
<DashWithRainbows> She has a waifu and dat's it.
<Petrified_Discord> Saturn: Don't forget neutron stars
<Saturn> 08,01GabeMoist: aye; we actually currently use the temperature of white dwarves to estimate the age of the universe
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Imagine the day we find the aliens...Or at least we're 1000 years late of finding them.
<Saturn> 08,01Petrified_Discord: our sun is not massive enough to become a neutron star
<Reikim> Either way, my heartfelt congratulations to LadyCanary and Wrek for finding each other. Here's hoping it works out. You're both ridiculously lucky, and I wish the best to both of you.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> when we're*
<Saturn> 08,01a neutron star is what's left after a supernova
<LadyCanary> .//////.
<GabeMoist> Quark stars are best stars
<Petrified_Discord> Saturn: Of course, i meant observed phenomena
<Saturn> 08,01our sun will not do that
<Nittany_Discord> Look up Cygnus X-1.
<Lyra`> saturn~
<Meanwhile> Anyone want to bet on how long it takes for that to crash?
<Saturn> 08,01hey Lyra`!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh god... my tv just got a Lets rock Elmo
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why...just...why
<Lyra`> hey babe <3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *ad
<Reikim> I try not to bet on things like that.
<Dark_Horst> what's the differenc ebetween neutron stars and white dwarves?
<Panda|Drawing> Saturn they have? I thought it was theory based on disapearance of light.
<Freefall29> SpadeMagnes[R]: *face hoof*
<Saturn> 08,01a neutron star is actually pretty cool
<Bronysith> BRONYFUNDS
<GabeMoist> Neutron stars are made of neutrons
<Saturn> 08,01it's basically a GIANT atom
<Nittany_Discord> Our sun will inflate before blowing it's outer layers off and becoming a carbon-oxygen white dwarf.
<Meanwhile> I just hope they're alright when it does.
<GabeMoist> Saturn, it's awesome
<Lyra`> havent seen you in a while, have i Saturn?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> And dr.who will be sitting there watching it along with the other aliens.
<Lavagirl6414> :)
<Ryunosuke> you know saturn
<LadyCanary> Thank you Reikim :3
<Ryunosuke> you are talking Billions to Trillions of years into the future :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> what ?
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: so... big mass of protons and neutrons with some electrons on the outer layer?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Man, I'm going to breeze through astrology when the time comes. I now know basics about stars.
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: well, mostly neutrons
<GabeMoist> Dark_Horst, pretty sure just neutrons
<Meanwhile> Canary and Wrek are apparently now an item.
<Saturn> 08,01very, very dense
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> Huh, where'd he go?
<Saturn> 08,01but not dense enough to be a balck hole
<Dark_Horst> that seems pretty dense, indeed
<Ryunosuke> yes still not black hole dense
<GabeMoist> Saturn, what about Quark stars?
<Freefall29> Bronysith: earthbound
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I had the most awesome ryme to remember the planets..I forgot it....:(
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> probably server derps
<Petrified_Discord> About the size of Manhatten
<Panda|Drawing> Saturn so essentially light bending happens when light passes over or through a blackhole and vice versa?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I know I'm gonna get alot of flak for this but this looks like a suped up version of Halo..to me anyway
<Nittany_Discord> There are no quark stars.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> 3 to 4 guys lost conenction at the same time
<Ryunosuke> actually
<Panda|Drawing> Nittany_Discord... put some clothes on D:
<Kandarihu_> Did the Rarity server die?
<Ryunosuke> bronysith, you want good art
<Reikim> Anyway, figures his first reaction is to bet on how long before it crashes.
<otakon> I'm back what I miss?
<Panda|Drawing> Meanwhile!
<Dark_Horst> Panda|Drawing: light cannot escape a black hole
<Kawaii_icybeauti> otakon: You missed a convo about the sun
<Panda|Drawing> otakon you missed awesome.
<Reikim> His second reaction, however, I can understand.
<Ryunosuke> well good art in video games, and since we are talking space, EVE has some pretty sexy art in it
<Meanwhile> Connection to IRC scrambled.
<Saturn> 08,01Panda|Drawing: almost; it's when light passes near a black hole, or other very dense object
<Panda|Drawing> Dark_Horst... not what I mean.
<Nittany_Discord> By the time you get enough mass to form a quark star, the star('s core) collapses the rest of the way.
<Saturn> 08,01see, light doesn't have a mass
<Saturn> 08,01but it *does* have a momentum
<Reikim> I'm sure they're mature enough to deal with it like adults, however.
<Petrified_Discord> Panda|Drawing: Dark_Horst: No, but it can bend around a black hole
<Meanwhile> My connection scrambled, what happened?
<Reikim> Wait...scratch that.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Wouldn't you entet another time in a black hole...*bases theroy off movies*
<Saturn> 08,01and things with momentum are affected by gravity
<Wrek> 05isnt light jsut radiation?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> long distance or they live close ? uhmm dunno i should't be asking in the first place
<Nittany_Discord> And I don't think quark degeneracy exists.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> enter*
<Reikim> Adults don't always even deal with that well.
<Panda|Drawing> Saturn so a dense object would also be the black dwarf you mentioned before?
<Reikim> Bleh
<Reikim> Thoughts confused
<Bronysith> otakon: I am doing an informative speech on "Video games as an artform" what other games besides Heavy rain and shadow of the colossus are art?
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: radiation is one way to describe light, yes
<Meanwhile> Canary lives in New York I think
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile several people are having inter derps
<Meanwhile> And Wrek lives in like, Scandanavia.
<Panda|Drawing> Or is that just a burned out star.
<otakon> Bronysith: Okami
<Reikim> Anyway, even if there's drama we probably won't be privy to it.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Whats this join the alpha squad thing that keeps showing up?
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: from what i last read, it's kind of a radiation that behaves somehwta like particles. confusing stuff
<DashWithRainbows> I'll do what I usually do
<Ryunosuke> http://bit.ly/Ooytpj -- something like this?
<Saturn> 08,01it's a propogating wave of electromagnetic flux
<Saturn> 08,01but it's also quantised and behaves like a particle
<DashWithRainbows> Watch from the sidelines.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Well, here it is....Many Very Excited Men Just had Sex under New York.
<Meanwhile> Get shanked?
<Petrified_Discord> Panda|Drawing: Final stage of a star that doesn't go supernova
<Reikim> With popcorn?
<Saturn> 08,01Panda|Drawing: a black dwarf isn't reallyt all that dense
<GabeMoist> It's a wave and a particle
<LadyCanary> Feel like Im in Geology again.
<Ryunosuke> let me find a bigger one
<Panda|Drawing> Saturn I was just asking.
<DashWithRainbows> Of course, I'd get shanked while eating popcorn.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Hell, but this is more fun. I had a shitty teacher last year
*Bronysith sets Panda|Drawing on fire
<Saturn> 08,01most of the star's mass will have been dissipated in the planetary nebula
<Reikim> Saturn.
<Reikim> Stop being so cool.
<Meanwhile> For once I truly hate to sound like the bad guy, but long distance things like that seldom work out. This is life, it's not a novel.
<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: <3
<Petrified_Discord> Saturn the science brony
<Bronysith> Reikim: and now you are targeted
<Reikim> Unfortunately? I agree.
<Dark_Horst> basically, light moves in waves that consist of photons. tiny packages of concentrated waves. Saturn, stop me wehn i'm talking bullshit
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is rhis real life ?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> inb4 bill nye song
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Just how long were you a astrophyisicis.. sorry for the miss spelling
<Meanwhile> Not the time T.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it's always the time at least for me
<Dark_Horst> light is confusing stuff
<Reikim> Either way...
<Meanwhile> She was depressed for weeks when she got dumped
<Panda|Drawing> Saturn forgive me, but... I would like to inquire about this later. I mean, space really does interest me. You have a vast knowlege I wish to tap into ^^
<Reikim> Ah
<Ryunosuke> http://fasterthanlightdotme.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/eve_online_crucible_wallpaper08.jpg - something like that Bronysith?
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: well, it's more that they exist as *both* waves and particles at the same time, depending on what they're interacting with
<Meanwhile> I'd hate to think what this is likely to bring on.
<Reikim> I don't remember this, but it explains the long absence.
<Saturn> 08,01if they're interacting with matter, light will generally behave as particles
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does this game have a minimap at all?
<Petrified_Discord> Double-slit experiment anyone?
<LadyCanary> Dis song
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dayyuuuummmm I gotta have dinner....I'm gonna miss the space convo :(
<Bronysith> Ryunosuke: that isnt the kind of artform i am talking about not good "art" in video games, i mean video games as an artform
<Saturn> 08,01Petrified_Discord: exactly!
<LadyCanary> Somehow it works alongside this game.
<Saturn> 08,01Petrified_Discord: works with electrons too!
<Ryunosuke> well
<Vordox> FPS! FPS EEEVEEERYYYWHEEEREEE!
<Reikim> ...
<Panda|Drawing> Petrified_Discord you are intelegent in this field too?
<Reikim> Wow.
<Reikim> I just realized the potential for drama here.
<Petrified_Discord> Panda|Drawing: I'd like to think so :)
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: that reminds me, some researchers, at an indian university, i think, managed to buid a highspeed camera that is fast enough to capture moving light
<Ryunosuke> the thing is, you cant really talk about video games as an art platform, without talking about the visuals itself
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'll excuse myself of this convo, not my business
<Lavagirl6414> :)
<Panda|Drawing> ^^ then Petrified_Discord, i will be talking to you more
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: saw the vid about that?
<Rustymeat> Oh I see wrek is streaming
<GabeMoist> Dark_Horst, I saw that
<Saturn> 08,01what's really cool is that the Young's Double Slit experiment works when only a single electron at a time is fired
<Rustymeat> planetside beta?
<Saturn> 08,01you still see diffraction fringes
<Reikim> We're just worrying about friends here.
<Saturn> 08,01which i think is awesome
<Petrified_Discord> Saturn: Man, I really wanna link the video now XD
<Bronysith> why am i thinking about the big bang theorgy....
<LadyCanary> Yes Rustymeat
<otakon> Rustymeat: Planetside 2 beta at that
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: i've read about it
<Ryunosuke> Video games is a combination of well paintings, video art, and musical arts
<otakon> Bronysith: bc light talk
<Ryunosuke> in a nutshell
<Reikim> I'd probably have the same reaction if two of my friends started dating.
<Meanwhile> All things considered it's none of our buisness, I just don't want things to resemble a tangled slinky by the time it's done.
<Panda|Drawing> hm...
<Panda|Drawing> I wonder
<Panda|Drawing> fight club
<Dark_Horst> isnt that young experiment the part where quantum physics come in?
<Ryunosuke> lols
<Reikim> Nothing we can do about it.
<Saturn> 08,01Petrified_Discord: not sure who's streaming, but ask them if you can link it
<Panda|Drawing> well
<Ryunosuke> war bar!
<Panda|Drawing> seems there isnt a bypass to that script XD
<Reikim> The best we can do is step back and watch things unfold and hope for the best.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> club fight ?
*Yahooz fight club
<Reikim> And with that, convo change.
<Rustymeat> it seems that wrek like to play sniper is every game
<Ryunosuke> club de la fights
<Reikim> Trix, how long until you get GW2 again?
<Petrified_Discord> Yo Wrek, mind if I link quantum mechanics?
<Panda|Drawing> Yahooz....
<Yahooz> oh nice it covers /me
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: hey wrek, you okay with us linking a youtube video about highspeed cameras capturing at light speed?
<Yahooz> clever

<Panda|Drawing> ...
<Meanwhile> Close enough.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Running running running
<Reikim> All right!
<Ryunosuke> I think the mods are smarter
<Petrified_Discord> Well for anyone who cares, just search youtube for "double slit experiment".
<Yahooz> whatabout fight-club
<Polydunami> Fixed the scottish rule up, Sumica? :3
<Panda|Drawing> Ryunosuke i know XD
<Yahooz> ooooooh
<Reikim> Only a short amount of time until there's actually someone around who's a lower level than me.
<Panda|Drawing> Yahooz O_O you found one
<Rustymeat> Petrified_Discord sounds kinky
*Bronysith puts Yahooz in a full nelson
<Petrified_Discord> Rustymeat: You have NO idea :D
<Meanwhile> There may come a day when Rei isn't a nub. But it is not this day.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> meh knowing i'll out level you a few days after i start
<Saturn> 08,01so yeah, science is awesome
<Panda|Drawing> no Saturn, you are awesome
<GabeMoist> indeed

<Rustymeat> Youre awesome
<Dovah> fite club is rules are wrong
<Reikim> Ding.

<Meanwhile> Gz.
<Panda|Drawing> what about flight club?
<Meanwhile> And yeah he's probably right. He'll probably lap you on the level curve. :P
<Dark_Horst> stop that
<Petrified_Discord> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3384/
<Bronysith> AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Panda|Drawing> Saturn xD theory of relativity is a hoot

<Panda|Drawing> Petrified_Discord XD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> knowing i'll be playing a MMO agin make miss ragnarok, tibia and others
<LadyCanary> Yar!
<Reikim> No he- screw it, let's be honest here, he's going to lap me while making a rude gesture out the window.
<Nittany_Discord> Is Saturn learning physics now?
<Rustymeat> dat snipe
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> more like waving at you i'm no one for rude gestures unless deserved
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Petrified_Discord :D
<nerf_soldier> barely.....followed.....converation........mind......feels.......exhuasted
<Polydunami> Saturn used to be an astrophysicist, Nittany_Discord
<GabeMoist> Saturn, I have an astronomy book I need to get to reading sometime
<Reikim> I don't understand how you all manage to level so quickly.
<Panda|Drawing> if Nittany_Discord and Saturn fused... I think the world would be in trouble... their knowlege is infinite O-o
<Dark_Horst> try quantum physics. it's like trying to think around the corner, then left
<Nittany_Discord> I have a bachelors in physics.
<Meanwhile> Magic.
<Nittany_Discord> I loved physics.
<Petrified_Discord> Who pinged me? Chat derped :P
<Panda|Drawing> I know :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the magoc of free time
<Ryunosuke> Satrun used to be an astrophysicist, until he took a star to the knee ;)

<GabeMoist> Nittany broke up with physics and became a maid
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WOAH that popup
<Reikim> EQD runs SFM stuff now?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm*
<Meanwhile> Seb really needs to sort that out or BerryPunch is never going to survive.
<Polydunami> Petrified_Discord, when your chat is scrolled up, it makes that sound every time a new message is typed.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim Trixie SFM insta post by seth
<Reikim> As in, computer keyboard, Trix?

<Bronysith> WE ALL GON DIE

<bicyclerepairman> magicks :3
<Cades> BLEH
<Panda|Drawing> bicyclerepairman... i smell a changeling!
<WildRepublicGuard> so what r we watching
<Petrified_Discord> Quantum mechanics: Answer the age old question of "If a tree falls in the forest and no one's there to hear it, does it make a sound?"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim needs a VHost
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Welp
<Polydunami> A TRILLION FRAMES PER SECOND?! :O
<Dark_Horst> WildRepublicGuard: planetside 2 beta
<Reikim> night Mean- damn.
<Reikim> VHost?

<Wrek> 05i like it
<Polydunami> My brain. It's all over the screen.
<Wrek> 05its not the best anime
<otakon> kick ass remix Wrek
<Petrified_Discord> AJIsAwesome: Sounds dark and wet
<Wrek> 05but its one of the absolute few i like
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> instead of the letters that make your host you get a name or something
<Wrek> 05togetehr with fullmetal alchemist
<AJIsAwesome> Petrified_Discord: :D
<Wrek> 05etc
<Dark_Horst> Polydunami: they fire one through a bottle full of water, you can actually watch it move around and see how it scatters and reflects
<otakon> AJisAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: Thanks.
<otakon> it's basically modern day Bebop
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Yes?
<Polydunami> Hang on, let me watch this video :S
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'm not liking how you can get totally blindsided in this game
<otakon> also can't tab you
<WildRepublicGuard> AJsAwesome: its great
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It looks like total bullshit
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Oh, Okay.
<otakon> odd
<bicyclerepairman> Panda|Drawing: you must be confusing me with someone >_>
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm. let me log off real quick.
<Reikim> Hm
<Reikim> Why should I get one?
<otakon> there we go I'm back
<Freefall29> ok.... is chat still alive
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ded again
<Panda|Drawing> bicyclerepairman nope... you are changeling! SPAI!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> for the lulz ?
<AJIsAwesome> Back. Try now.
*bicyclerepairman gasps and disappears
<Petrified_Discord> bicyclerepairman: GET THE SPAI
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does this game even have a freaking minimap/radar?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dunno it hides your internet host sooo yeah
<Petrified_Discord> SpadeMagnes[R]: Bottom-left
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Doesnt seem to do much good
<Reikim> Perhaps then.
<Freefall29> does this game have two weapon limit?
<Petrified_Discord> Nope :3
<shibaru> I think I should rebuild my house again.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Not insulting Wrek but he seems to be getting blindsided alot
<Petrified_Discord> This singer reminds me of the cookie monster
<shibaru> People still keep getting stuck
*Ponies47 Returns
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Welcome back. :)
<Ponies47> Thanks AJIsAwesome :3
<thelonepony> wb Ponies47
<Ponies47> Thanks thelonepony :3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I find that armwave you do when you die is silly
<otakon> Petrified_Discord: he's German
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It looks like your throwing a grenade
<Dark_Horst> otakon: ....that'S swedish
<Reikim> I am lagging so very badly.
<Petrified_Discord> Swedish German
<Dark_Horst> no. swedish
<Petrified_Discord> Swedish fish?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Swerman
<Dark_Horst> maybe
<Dark_Horst> never heard swedish fish talk
<Cades> lol
<Reikim> The entire world is frozen but I'm running around it
<shibaru> FUUUUUCK!!! I JUST GOT DR PEPPER IN MY EYE WHAT THE HELL
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lawl
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Echo..echo...
<Pearly> Pearly has returned
<otakon> how about Swedish Chef talk?
<otakon> wb Pearly
<Cades> lol wtf?
<Reikim> And then suddenly, hit by so much damage
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Boom
<thelonepony> wb Pearly
<Cades> omg its so cold in my house
<shibaru> I just took a sip and a little drop just randomly decided to defy gravity I guess
<Dark_Horst> the only complaint i have so far is that this game looks somehwat sterile in the open areas
<Dark_Horst> i hope they change that until release
<Cades> :O
<AJIsAwesome> Pearly: Hi! :)
<Phase4> berrypunch y u no rejoin
<SpadeMagnes[R]> One complaint I have is you seem to get blindsided by enemies way too easily
<Dark_Horst> what do you mean with blindsided?
<Phase4> :eval msg.reply('!voice')
<BerryPunch> Phase4: !voice
<BerryPunch> Phase4: PRIVMSG #bronystateregulars :Phase4: !voice
<Phase4> derp
<shibaru> I cloned Mike three times and all three clones started cooking at the same time.
<Phase4> :eval msg.send_privmsg('#bronystateregulars', '!voice')
<BerryPunch> !voice
<BerryPunch> Phase4: PRIVMSG #bronystateregulars :!voice
<Dark_Horst> oh, that
<Dark_Horst> just lokked it up. but that's something that happens in every shooter
<Phase4> 00,02ohai pony_3696
<Phase4> 00,02:3
<Reikim> Hm?
<Dark_Horst> at least in multiplayer shooters
<Dark_Horst> especially on large scale maps
<Pearly> hey AJIsAwesome
*Reikim is now confused
<Dark_Horst> so not relly point of critique
<Phase4> :say mfw i forgot this command XD
<BerryPunch> mfw i forgot this command XD
<Pearly> thanks thelonepony and otakon
*Bronysith glomps Phase4
<otakon> hiya Phase4 what's up?
<Reikim> Why did she
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I guess... I just hate getting killed from fucking nowhere
<Reikim> :say
<BerryPunch> Reikim: Level 8 authorization required. (Current level: 0)
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith and otakon
<Phase4> 00,02not much
<Reikim> Oh
<Reikim> You can make the bot say things?
<Phase4> :P
<otakon> Dark_Horst: means he doesn't look around and keep track of his surroundings
<Phase4> Reikim, yes
<Reikim> I just realized when I saw the Sweetie Belle is : S
<Reikim> :s
<Dark_Horst> too late, already asked an english discitonary^^
<Reikim> ...Quick question. Why?
<Phase4> o_O
<Dark_Horst> but yeah, that'S something you cannot avoid with so much space to move around
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Welp
<Phase4> not sure what you meen
<Phase4> i wonder
<Phase4> :say !voice Phase4
<BerryPunch> !voice Phase4
<Phase4> XD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Whats that 39:99 thing that keeps showing up?
<Phase4> should probably get that flag changed
<Dark_Horst> try arma. getting blindsided is the only thing that happens in there
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: premium stuff
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Pre order?
<Reikim> ...I don't get it?
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[R]: yep
<Phase4> :say !voice Reikim
<BerryPunch> !voice Reikim
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: basically extra in game money and access to higher tier gear for one time fee of 30 bucks
<RoboGerbil> Bronysith: sorry about that fiasco in l4d2 :(
<Reikim> For starters, why would you want to get the bot to say something?
<Phase4> :say !devoice Reikim
<BerryPunch> !devoice Reikim
<Dark_Horst> otakon: nope, it's the price of the game
<Bronysith> RoboGerbil: it was funny
<Nittany_Discord> It's funny.
<otakon> Dark_Horst: the game is Free2Play
<Phase4> Reikim, cause i can make it use !voice
<otakon> it's bonus stuff
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I know its fair to give pre order bonuses but it seems kind of stupid to give pre order people a advantage
<Nittany_Discord> I get around liking maids here, and then I come home to being treated like a maid by my grandmother, and I couldn't be more miserable.
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[R]: *an
<Reikim> Why? Don't you get that command yourself?
<Phase4> !voice
<Phase4> nope
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Nittany_Discord: Oh the irony
<Nittany_Discord> Yep.
<Reikim> Huh
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we should lay off the maid stuff for a while. :S
<Dark_Horst> otakon: so, early starter package?
<otakon> Dark_Horst: exactly
<Reikim> Makes a bit more sense
<otakon> in-game purchase basically
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I will think the pre order isnt stupid if the stuff they get is allready availble to others just harder to get
<otakon> gives you a HUGE starting advantage
<SpadeMagnes[R]> otakon: That seems kind of unfair to me...
<Nittany_Discord> It's searingly-sharp irony.
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: that's what it is, you're "buying power" basically
<RanbowDash90> lol
<Wrek> 05a majority of my deaths are FF
<Dark_Horst> ah, there it is http://www.planetside2.com/alpha-squad
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I hate games that make you pay so you can have the advantage
<Dark_Horst> funny, it's cheaper here on the homepage
<Dark_Horst> so not only is it a starter package but also gurantied beta access
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Whats FF?
<Reikim> Actually, for the most part PlanetSide 2 just allows you to buy stuff that you would get anyway, and some graphical gimmicks.
<Reikim> It's a lot like TF2, now that I think of it.
<Reikim> But slightly closer to LoL.
<LadyCanary> Dis guitar <3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Theres friendly fire in this game?
<Wrek> 05yes
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why
<Wrek> 05100% friendly fire
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Just why
<Reikim> Ahaha
<Reikim> I like this game
<Dark_Horst> yeah, this package just seems to be something like "pay to get it earlier"
<Wrek> 05becasue unlike BF3 the players of planetside dotn shoot eachotehr itnentionally
<Phase4> 00,02friendly fire would significantly change how a game plays
<Dark_Horst> i'm guessing the instant beta access is the bulk of the price
<Reikim> Honestly? That's what it is, Horst.
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: barely ever happened to me
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Whoops
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: thouhg, i did die a lot by teammates becasue they're jsut dumb fucks for the most part. cod kiddies that got attracted to the fancy graphics
<Rustymeat> owchies
<Reikim> I'm imagining the chaos of an MMOFPS with friendly fire.
<Reikim> It's hilarious.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Tried CoD once.. got bored of it...fast
<Rustymeat> dat galaxy
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> chaos is right
<RubbishBin> Hello everypony ^-^
*Bronysith sets RubbishBin on fire
<Bronysith> hi
<Rustymeat> Wrek is terran republic right?
<AJIsAwesome> Tried to get back into CoD before.....got incredibly bored in the first match.
<AJIsAwesome> TubbHi! :)
<Barbetos> Anyone figure out yet what server he is on?
<AJIsAwesome> RubbishBin: Hi! :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wut
<Rustymeat> lolwut
<AJIsAwesome> Spelling fail. :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> CLIPPING
<Rustymeat> dat error sound?
<Rustymeat> oh that was me
<Rustymeat> derp
<Dark_Horst> damn.... i'm conflicted. one hand, i DO want to get beta access... on the other hand i follow the strict principle of not paying dor content that can be unlocked for free
<Dark_Horst> fuuuuck
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The fuck is that guy on the floor doing?
<Reikim> Dark_Horst: I support the second.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He's just slip sliding around
<Barbetos> Wrek wut server u on?
<Dark_Horst> Reikim: but man... beta access!
<Wrek> 05Barbetos EU2
<Wrek> 05terran
<Reikim> Dark_Horst: Pay to play an incomplete game?
<Reikim> By the way, anyone else who's watched King Gainer...is the opening supposed to be this trippy?
<Barbetos> I wish you lived closer dernit! =P It would be awesome if you could play in a west coast server and join the TTA.
<Dark_Horst> Reikim: a strong counter argument that part of my brain want to ignore
<Dark_Horst> time to beat that part into submission
<SpadeMagnes[R]> lol
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: is station cash something that can be earned ingame or is it a strict premium currency?
<Reikim> Dark_Horst: Did you own PlanetSide 1?
<Dark_Horst> no
<Reikim> Ah
<Wrek> 05PREMIUM AFAIK
<LadyCanary> ....Ohgod.
<Polydunami> :( Suicide
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/4san/
<Polydunami> That kid has a horrible fashion sense :|
<Dark_Horst> premium currency... that does not bode well
<Reikim> It just buys clothes.
<Dark_Horst> that relieves me
<Dark_Horst> and also makes me question the use of it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I assume its nothing like credits in Reach
<Reikim> It's like TF2.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I liked the Armor custimization in that
<Reikim> It'll buy things you'd get anyway.
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah, right. "look at ma fancy cahmooflage, hur"
<Ponies47> Chat derepd
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Reach had alot of nice armor
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek, how long have you been streaming? :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> DED
<Reikim> Actually, it's more like LoL. Apparently they were directly inspired.
<Wrek> 05too long
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: I think you need to take a break. :D
<Ponies47> Wrek: All day/night?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Shoot someone right next to you with a explosive shot... SEEMS LEGIT
<Dark_Horst> as long as everything in the game is achievable through honest killing, i'm happy
<SpadeMagnes[R]> There is nothing I love more than showing the little fucktards who think their so tough whos boss
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also chat is ded
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.avi
<Polydunami> You mean children play violent first person shooters?! Oh, the horror :O
*Ponies47 Pokes the chat
<Polydunami> :3
*Dovah slaps Ponies47
<Dovah> no!
*Ponies47 Throws Dovah into the river
<Apple_Jack> Howdy everpony /)
<Dovah> Yay a river of the blood of all my enimies!
<Ponies47> Hey Apple_Jack
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I hated this one report on tv that went on about Parents being upset about people in online games being rude to their kids
<Dovah> SpadeMagnes[R]: when the truth is its the stupid little kids that are being rude.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> If you don't want your kids to deal with that kind of crap, why are you letting them online to begin with
<Dark_Horst> that'S like complaining about god when other kids on the schoolyard are mean
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And if you can't handle being insulted a bit, why are you on the internet
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah, remmebr how glados told you in portal you were fat and adopted?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh that fucking report
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, I HATED that report. :|
<Apple_Jack> well most kids play games that are rated teen and up, if you honestly think your child is going to be playing in an enchanted medow with gumdrops scattered across the place and everyone is friendly, your sorley mistaken
<Dark_Horst> there was a pair of very, VERY dump parents who got their poop in a know becasue their daughter HAPPENED to be adopted
<Dark_Horst> *knot
<AJIsAwesome> I wish parents would actually pay attention to the ESRB once in a while. :|
<Saturn> 08,01oh!
<Saturn> 08,01is CrimsonPhoenix here?
*Bronysith sets CrimsonPhoenix on fire
<Bronysith> not anymore
<Dark_Horst> there is only one thing parents should do: watch the rating on the package and shut the fuck up about everything else
<Unnr> Bronysith: You just set a phoenix on fire... =.(\ logic fail
<Apple_Jack> what games being streamed?
<Dark_Horst> planetside 2 beta
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I think one of the games in the report was TF2 or Halo or something... i forgot
<otakon> hiya Saturn how are you today?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Anyway
<Dovah> Did chat die?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *cough*
<AJIsAwesome> nope

<Dark_Horst> i didnt notice
<DocSane> Molestia has a grey mane, right?
<thelonepony> eeyup
<sub06905> not sure

<abrony> ded
<Kandarihu> fluttercry, not quite. The only way to bring the dead back to life is by bringing the Dragonballs together to summon the dragon and wishing them back to life. However, the Dragon can never grant the same wish twice (meaning that the dragon can not bring someone to life who it has previously revived). Furthermore, the dragonballs become inert for a year after the dragon was summoned and can't even be found.

*MrMalk sings along
<Klumzeedragon> These are a few of my favourite things~
<JusticeKoro> And this is one of the reasons Toriyama decided to just get rid of the power level thing; the numbers were getting ridiculous. Super Saiyan Goku's power level was like 100,000,000

<Klumzeedragon> I don't see how he hasn't been permabanned yet... pisses off all the mods and has been banned twice in one week even. :D
<Klumzeedragon> Later therainbowvortex, take it easy man. Hope things work out.
<AdamTheDuck> It's strange, I was there for both bans as well o.o
<Caramel> 2,14 I miss something?
<sub06905> all dem ponies
<Caramel> 2,14 sometimes I swear the trolls are watching behind my back, waiting for when I leave the computer
<AdamTheDuck> Pisses the mods off so much
<Klumzeedragon> Caramel: Nah. Just wondering how flutterchu is always pissing off the mods and always rude but doesnt have a perma ban yet.
<twilight_sprinkle> Caramel: hes not so much a troll, more of an idiot
<Klumzeedragon> And rude. Definitely rude.
<Ninjazz> ^
<AdamTheDuck> twilight_sprinkle, there's a difference?
<twilight_sprinkle> and i hate calling people stupid. but honestly, that guy is just...
<Ninjazz> Actually, AdamTheDuck, there is. A troll can be clever.
<Ninjazz> Very clever.
<sub06905> inb4 Caramel dance :$
<Buytoast> Who's banned now?
<AdamTheDuck> Touche Ninjazz, touche.
<Klumzeedragon> Buytoast: No one. :D
<Klumzeedragon> What language is this?
<sub06905> dutch i believe
<Kandarihu> Yes, dutch
<SafariMonkey1> Hey guys
<Caramel> 2,14 well, I'm not particular to talking behind people's backs
<NocturnalBlade> hi SafariMonkey
<Sumica> 00,10woh that was freeky, randomly seeing pinkie go by in the background on my PC
<Klumzeedragon> Caramel: Yeah... sorry.
<Caramel> 2,14 but if he ever breaks the rules when I'm watching, I'll take the appropriate action
<SafariMonkey1> Hi NocturnalBlade
<Ninjazz> Sumica's PC is haunted by Pinkie Pie.
<NocturnalBlade> i've never seen flutterchu break any rules...maybe i'm not here when it happens XD
<Sumica> 00,10seems that the checking I was doing on the animations they have that I though had crashed had not crashed fully
<sub06905> after all the gen 3.5 shown here i just dont mind anymore
<Ninjazz> He doesn't break rules, just talks too much when he shouldn't.
<NocturnalBlade> Ninjazz: aaaaah
<Sumica> 00,10so you are saying we need to go to gen 3.6?
<Caramel> 2,14 unfortunately, that's a very fine line to tread
<sub06905> Sumica: yes
<Ninjazz> ...
<sub06905> we need moar new borns on the stream
<Caramel> 2,14 technically, it's not against the rules unless he starts goint too far
<Ninjazz> Seeing as how I don't have stream up, go right on ahead, Sumica.
<Caramel> 2,14 ask, and ye shall receive
<Ninjazz> Caramel, when he starts pissing people off?
<Polydunami> It's Caramel, Ninjazz
<sub06905> inb4 i regret this
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: well i talk too much often too, but i do it for the sake of discussion. that guy is too biased to have any sort of discussion with
<NocturnalBlade> :D
<sub06905> lol wut :D
<Polydunami> I'm too jaded to care anymore -_-
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: Eh. He spams a lot. And caps a lot. Plus he's fought with wrek about RPing and also said that Saturns sexual prefference weirded him out.
<Caramel> 2,14 I haven't particularly seen that when I'm around. But if a person in the chat is beginning to offend and the mods aren't doing something about it, the best course of action
<Caramel> 2,14 is to PM a mod, don't confront the person
<Caramel> 2,14 protip: let the mods do their jobs and everything will be better
<sub06905> that is one long house
<Buytoast> Are you talking about that Flutterchu fella?
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah but i would rprefer to talk it over with most people before resorting to bans
<twilight_sprinkle> *prefer
<Klumzeedragon> Buytoast: eeyup.
<Sumica> 00,10they told her to go play in the corrner of a round house
<Sumica> 00,10beep beep, ima cloud
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, well see that and being rude are two different things.
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: That explains everything!
<Ninjazz> Raincloud! Save us!
<Shizuka> 13meep meep
<Shizuka> 13pay no attention to little me
<AdamTheDuck> I can only handle 'so' much insanity...
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: i know, but i mean even if the other person is being rude i usually try to talk it over. that guy is a bit nuts though..
<Rommulus> what fresh hell have I joined into?
<sub06905> i believe this video would be more funny if moar people were in the chat, freaking out about gen 3.6 and how they need to use mind bleach
<NocturnalBlade> hi Rommulus
<Caramel> 2,14 fair enough
<Sumica> 00,10it loops so well
<Klumzeedragon> Rommulus: The seventh circle.
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: we've developed a resistance
<twilight_sprinkle> honestly i find this kinda cute
<NocturnalBlade> twilight_sprinkle: so true
<sub06905> welcome Rommulus, i asked for gen 3.6 and we received it
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, same or I don't try to talk/associate myself with that kind of person.
<Ponymon-Anarchy> wtf am i watching
<thegt90> someone said mind bleach ill take 2 gallons
<Kencolt> Eh, handling that loop is easy. All you have to do is do what the writers/animators for that series did... turn off your brain.
<Buytoast> is this that rainbows make babies video?
<thegt90> better make it 4
<Ponymon-Anarchy> wat
<Sumica> 00,10where do baby ponies come from?
<Ponymon-Anarchy> WAT

<Ponymon-Anarchy> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<sub06905> tis be an entire episode Caramel?
<Buytoast> i knew it
<Rommulus> I think I will be comming back later.
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: Double rainbows all the way!
<Caramel> 2,14 pretty much
<Buytoast> i bloody knew it
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<Rommulus> Have fun all
<Ponymon-Anarchy> RUN AWAY
<AdamTheDuck> Time to watch my first 3.5 episode
<Polydunami> Yep. I've become jaded.

<Caramel> 2,14 adamtheduck, this isn't 3.5
<Rommulus> bye! gotta run literally!

<AdamTheDuck> 3.6?
<Caramel> 2,14 a common mistake, mind you
<NocturnalBlade> bye rom
<Sumica> 00,10always dresses in style
<The_Naked_Pony> I'm not sure where baby ponies come from. o_0
<Klumzeedragon> Dat Rainbow Dash.
<twilight_sprinkle> funny how this RD is the total opposite of g4
<Polydunami> Looks like baby ponies pop out of boxes :P
<Ninjazz> Rainbow Dash always dresses in style.
<thegt90> there mouths dont move why
<Buytoast> oh holy shit this looks like some surrreal deviant art fan animation
<Sumica> 00,10personaly I prefer worlds bigest tea party
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<twilight_sprinkle> this doesnt even look like legit animation
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, and more like Rarity.
<NocturnalBlade> awww poor dashie
<Kandarihu> Whenever I find people being rude, it's a matter of free speech. I can't expect to have someone banned for expressing an offensive opinion (even if it's only for the sake of trolling) because my honestly held beliefs are often considered EXTREMELY offensive to a lot of people.
<MASF123> Hmmm let me refresh stream and...oh gawd. D:
<Klumzeedragon> Whose a silly pony?
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: yeah. only lacks her awesome voice :3
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: There's mareason for that. THe Baby POnies thing WASN'T legitamate animation.
<Sumica> 00,10freespeach is not protected in all venues
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: yeah im not a fan of banning over opinions either.
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, Oh my YES. It's her personality, but it's not her voice. ;_;
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/33dI3.jpg
<Caramel> 2,14 sumi, whatever happened to that video dari always plays?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: so fanmade then?
<Caramel> 2,14 I can't seem to find it
<Polydunami> Needs more milk
<sub06905> i believe i have built up a immunity to the other gens of ponies, its just fun to freak out with the chat :D
<twilight_sprinkle> oh god
<twilight_sprinkle> not that video
<Sumica> 00,10uhhh which one?
<Ninjazz> lemon whores?
<Kencolt> twilight_sprinkle: No. Just massively incompetent.

<Spectrum_Rush> Caramel: the sexting one?
<Ninjazz> OH.
<Sumica> 00,10oh the dash one with the saxy music?
<Ninjazz> Thank God I don't have stream up.
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah

<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: wow, that Is massively incompetent. half the g4 fanvids are better
<MASF123> Um Rainbow Dash what are you...
<Klumzeedragon> Dun dun duuun.

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> 0_o
<Ninjazz> Polydunami, I really hope not.

<NocturnalBlade> lets spin this S*yay*T
<SaxyPretender> 0,14doubt it, he hates ponies >.>
<Ninjazz> jackiechan.jpg.
<Ninjazz> >played with RD's VA
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but he knows her from elsewhere
<Ninjazz> >Hates ponies.
<Ninjazz> >knew she was VA though
<Kandarihu> The only thing that bugs me about this video is the fact that she's breaking the bottles over the batter and getting glass into the dish.
<Ninjazz> How do?
<Ninjazz> Ohhhh.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> 0_o
<sub06905> cupcake money?: http://images.johnnycupcakes.com/img/ct_money_cupcakes.JPG
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's the funny thing about my best friend, he knows these pony VAs, but hates ponies
<Ninjazz> Kandarihu, and Rarity is the only one that eats it. She's the real Iron Pony.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Erica Mendez, Rina-Chan, LilyPichu
<MadSurge> AWWW YEAH
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> YES
<Ninjazz> Well, EVERYONE knows Rina-Chan.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14no, like on a semi-personal level
<MadSurge> Arcade game!
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: in a good or bad way.
<Ninjazz> o_o like actually /knows/ her?
<MASF123> Who dafuq is Rina-Chan?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> this NEEDS to be made!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14apparently, her Korean is really good
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, good. Who would hate Rina....
<Ninjazz> MASF123, srsly?
<MASF123> jk.
<Klumzeedragon> Aw yeah. So retro quick time events. :D
<Ninjazz> Pffft. :p
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: Meanwhile does.
<Caramel> 2,14 a lot of people said some very salty things to her
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, Meanwhile hates everything/one.
<Ninjazz> Except Francis and Pinkie Pie.
<Klumzeedragon> And my chat derped.
<Ninjazz> And can't be too certain on Francis.
<Caramel> 2,14 which is just absurd. It's different to not like a particular person's work, than to send flat out offensive things to them
<DoctoDoctorWho> anypony else up at this ungodly hour?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: at worst I just ignore her
<NocturnalBlade> hi DoctoDoctorWho
<Caramel> 2,14 I would certainly hope NO ONE in this chat is responsible for any hatemail going out there
<MASF123> Ninjazz, yeah really >_>
<SaxyPretender> 0,14she seems a nice person from when I interiewed her
<Caramel> 2,14 because that's not the kind of environment we want to create
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: but she does a pretty good Twilight
<Klumzeedragon> DoctoDoctorWho: A lot of ponies are. >_>
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> dat MK friendship
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I mean, she's a Guilty Gear fan, I can't hate that!
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, Rina? I think she's a superb VA. Might be a little too popular but nothing's wrong with her.
<MadSurge> I want minigames like these! :D
<Caramel> 2,14 She's a very nice gal, personally I'd like to meet her. At the very least, I'd like to thank her for coming on before
<sub06905> i only knew of Rina-chan because of Brawl taunts :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> caramel stream?
<NocturnalBlade> eeyup
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: yes
<Ninjazz> Yep.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I knew of her from Skullgirls
<Ninjazz> I knew her from Newgrounds.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so I totally flipped out at her panel at bronycon when that was brought up
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>
<Ninjazz> She's EVERYWHERE there.
*SaxyPretender totally didn't get everyone staring at him...
<Kandarihu> Ninjazz, the only redeeming factor of the ultra-high-calorie dishes made by Epic Meal Time is that they are ALWAYS consumed by groups. I suspect that they fast for days at a time in advance of their videos.
<Spectrum_Rush> oh so that was you making all that noice SaxyPretender :S
<MadSurge> SaxyPretender: I realized who she was from Apple.Mov, but my fav role of hers is Skullgirls' final boss :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it was that one time! >.>
<Kandarihu> Wow. I should've finished typing that before going afk
<MadSurge> HAHAHAHAHAHA
<Sumica> 00,10kill every guard watching a door> find out there was an easy back way to room behind door
<NocturnalBlade> yay
<Ninjazz> Kandarihu, I didn't know that. Also that'd better be the case, those things can kill you!
<Spectrum_Rush> SaxyPretender: only takes one time, i think it choed throughout the entire convention center
<Ninjazz> Dis Epic Wub Time.
<MadSurge> Sumica: story of my life :D
<Spectrum_Rush> *echoed
<sub06905> mfw i thought this was from the show :D
<Ninjazz> Sumica, every Splinter Cell game.

<Sumica> 00,10deus ex
<SaxyPretender> 0,14;___;

<Klumzeedragon> Am I bad not knowing what Skullgirls is?
<MadSurge> sub06905: pretty good huh

*MadSurge headbangs
<Klumzeedragon> it*
<DoctoDoctorWho> just because thats the only thing his series is known for
<Kandarihu> This video needs to end on a "Deleted from Youtube" joke given the fate of this song in it's series of origin.
<NocturnalBlade> Klumzeedragon: lucky *pout*
<MadSurge> The singer kinda looks like Andrew W. K. :D
<Klumzeedragon> DoctoDoctorWho: Nah, it's a great show full of comedy. Brutality. And METAL. And you know, cocaine addicted clones.
<NocturnalBlade> *clowns
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: he was based on someone. could be that guy
<Moopy> Fuck yeah
<Klumzeedragon> Yes. Clowns. :D
<AdamTheDuck> Now you know why I started licking people...
<NocturnalBlade> :D
<Kandarihu> AdamTheDuck, lol
<Klumzeedragon> AdamTheDuck: Cause you like to lick ponies for rainbow flavours?
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: anyone tasting like raisins?
<Caramel> 2,14 cause that's not creepy at all
<Saxoffender> Twilight isn't convinced...

<Klumzeedragon> DoctoDoctorWho: I wouldnt be surprised if she was. I wouldnt be surprised of she is that easily amused
<sub06905> http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/183/1/2/wanna_cyber__by_breakingchattanooga-d3kqvi4.jpg
<DoctoDoctorWho> anypony else have a dawww stuck in their throat?
<Spectrum_Rush> sub06905: love that part of the url say Breaking the chat
<Klumzeedragon> Yeah. I can see that. :D
<AdamTheDuck> Caramel, Yeah but my licks are like; http://fav.me/d4c576s . Please tell me that's not creepy :<
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah, it is
<Klumzeedragon> DoctoDoctorWho: I get d'aws from Crayon Vision. :P
<Caramel> 2,14 this may come as a surprise to you, but licking people you don't know is a bit odd
<sub06905> ^
<AdamTheDuck> :/
<Polydunami|PS> :O NO WAI
<Polydunami|PS> :|
<Ninjazz> Atleast it's not rude.
<Ninjazz> Just... odd.
<Klumzeedragon> But we're clean. :P It's not like he'll get sick.
<DoctoDoctorWho> hng, hup, Hnngggggggggg
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah....we're changing the conversation -_-
<DoctoDoctorWho> hrrprachdlfkjfhsuhu
<NocturnalBlade> :D
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<Klumzeedragon> Caramel: Crayon Vision?
<Ninjazz> So who here prefers caramel over chocolate?
<Caramel> 2,14 I'll give you one guess Ninjazz
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ninjazz: sorry, not me
<NocturnalBlade> Ninjazz: not me, sorry
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: I like caramel in my chocolate. ;)
<NocturnalBlade> Klumzeedragon: same
<Ninjazz> ...
<wowviewer> I like chocalate
<Moopy> me to
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im still fine with mod Caramel tho
<NocturnalBlade> ^
<Saxoffender> I'll put my chocolate in some caramel...yeah
<Spectrum_Rush> I like Vanilla
*Spectrum_Rush Come at me bro
<Ninjazz> Caramel, you may or may not be a Caramel fan.
<Klumzeedragon> If we are going after flavours though, I love Cinnamon?
<Caramel> 2,14 chocolate actually makes me ill, so my preference to caramel isn't particularly difficult to see why
<DoctoDoctorWho> now that ive recovered whats strea-hnghhhusgsygysgf
<Moopy> Hvae you guys ever herd of linerider?
<Ninjazz> Oh. Well, that's an even better reason.
<Phase4> 00,02Caramel, so you cant enjoy chocolate?
<Caramel> 2,14 eenope
<Phase4> 00,02:'(
<Caramel> 2,14 makes me sick to my stomach
<Ninjazz> Allergies?
<Phase4> 00,02lactose or something else?
<NocturnalBlade> Caramel: that sucks?
<Ninjazz> Or just plain dislike?
<Caramel> 2,14 not sure
*DoctoDoctorWho comes at Spectrum_Rush
<AdamTheDuck> o.0
<Ninjazz> Ah. So it's just like not liking onions or garlic.
<MadSurge> Yay, pu parw retniW!
<Moopy> linerider is cool
<Phase4> 00,02i love onions and garlic
<DoctoDoctorWho> Spectrum_Rush: so, what now?
<Ninjazz> Me too, Phase4. But my father HATES onions.
<Saxoffender> can't eat chocolate huh...you will never become willy wonka!
<Caramel> 2,14 I know I'm slightly lactose intolerant, but normally lactose products just make my stomach mildly upset
<Caramel> 2,14 so not like...deathly allergic or anything
<Klumzeedragon> Phase4: Garlic is amazing, cant do onions though. :D I don't like the texture.
<Phase4> 00,02odd
<Kencolt> pU parW retniW?
<MadSurge> ^
<DoctoDoctorWho> yes
<Ninjazz> Well, perhaps the caffiene and other chemicals amplify the effects.
<Phase4> 00,02Klumzeedragon, i think onions have a great texture, to each their own i supose
<MadSurge> Caramel: good for you! :)
<Klumzeedragon> Yeah. :) Exactly. Not gonna bash anyone for opinions.
<Kandarihu> Too much chocolate for me and milk starts feeling really good. Same with too much milk. Chocolate becomes refreshing.
<Moopy> www.google.com/linerider
<Saxoffender> unwraping winter unwraping winter ♫ ♫
<Klumzeedragon> Moopy: 404. :P

<Phase4> 00,02XAX, :P
<Ninjazz> XAXAXAX
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: Onion powder is okay. :D But I only tolerate the taste. It's mainly the texture but, not a big fan of onion taste either.
<XAX> XAX = PC
<XAX> AXA = iPod
<XAX> :p
<Moopy> AXAXAXAXAXA
<DoctoDoctorWho> We should listen to the ginyu force theme next, waddya say?
<Caramel> 2,14 not really taking requests atm, but you can ask whoever goes after me if they are
<DoctoDoctorWho> dammit
<Ninjazz> Klumzeedragon, hmmm. Well that's alot better than what my dad has. He can't take the taste. As long as you just take the onions out of the dish afterwords, you can still enjoy a complete dish.
<Ninjazz> Dat Trident.
<MadSurge> Aww yeah books!
<Ninjazz> Noice OC.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 welp, I think that's as much as I can do tonight...very...very tired

<DoctoDoctorWho> who here thinks the ginyu force could have their own series?
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight ValtheJean
<Spectrum_Rush> thanks for stream ValtheJean
<Kandarihu> Thanks for the stream.
<Kencolt> I LOVE onions. Love love love them. Baked, fried, stewed, sauteed, even raw-- especiall a Vidalia-- I just love onions.\
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: Exactly. That's how I am if I can't get all the onion out. :D
<Kandarihu> BTW, where did you find that giant DBZ Abridged video?
<Polydunami|PS> Onion rings
<Ninjazz> Klumzeedragon, >.<
<Klumzeedragon> Thanks for the stream Caramel. :)
<Polydunami|PS> I LOVE onion rings.
<Ninjazz> I'm with Kencolt on this one. And Polydunami|PS.
<DoctoDoctorWho> so, snuggles?
<Moopy> #Dashiesauce
<Polydunami|PS> Oy
<Ninjazz> Oi.
<Ninjazz> Moopy, don't chan advertise.
<Klumzeedragon> Polydunami|PS: Honestly... The only onion I can eat. And usually I only get it at Carls Jr. On their Western Burger. :D
<Moopy> wow dude just wow
<Ninjazz> Already got in trouble for that one. >.<
<Moopy> pfft
<DoctoDoctorWho> pot pie?
<Klumzeedragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRFecBw1DaQ
<Klumzeedragon> Crayon Vision~
<Polydunami|PS> I've been reading through Problem Sleuth lately.
<Kandarihu> Never mind. I thought the Frieza saga was split between Season 2 and 3. I was wrong about that. There are videos that have Season 1 and 2 together and run for multiple hours
<Polydunami|PS> I got MUCH more than what I bargained for :S
<Moopy> eenope
<MASF123> He DID whaaat? :O
<DaringDerpy> hello bronystate
<Polydunami|PS> Hello, DaringDerpy :)
<Ninjazz> Hello, DaringDerpy.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Klumzeedragon: in 10 seconds you just managed to summarize the entire save derpy phenomenon, good job
<Klumzeedragon> DaringDerpy: Hows it going? :)
<DaringDerpy> you don't want to know, Klumzeedragon ^^
<Klumzeedragon> DoctoDoctorWho: :D I love Derpy no matter how she is.
<Klumzeedragon> DaringDerpy: That bad eh? :S
<DaringDerpy> hm...
<AdamTheDuck> A late hello to you DaringDerpy :P
<DaringDerpy> :)
<Klumzeedragon> DaringDerpy: Are you okay at least? :)
<DaringDerpy> ah...chat was a stupid idea...gtg...have fun :)
<AdamTheDuck> Bye DaringDerpy
<MadSurge> Klumzeedragon: I like when Derpy is not dumber than a brick :D
<Ninjazz> A common misconception about Derpy Hooves is that she's stupid when in actuality she just has a seeing problem.
<Ninjazz> She's pretty much a genious above Twilight's level.
<Ninjazz> She just can't express it.
<AdamTheDuck> But she doesn't have a seeing problem, she's just being efficient in her field of view
<MASF123> Rainbow Dash is blind.
<Ninjazz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRFecBw1DaQ
<Klumzeedragon> MadSurge: But she's not~ Just ditzy. :D
<Klumzeedragon> Reposting the video I posted? :P
<Ninjazz> That is by far the most adorable thing I've seen today.
<Ninjazz> yes, Klumzeedragon.
<Ninjazz> But I did fabulously. :p
<Klumzeedragon> You diiiid. :P
<Klumzeedragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDgk2YMzGpY Here you go. More adorableness.
<Saturn> 08,01this is the most awesomely accurate description of ADD i've seen: http://xkcd.com/1106/
<PhoneCherry> Hallow!
<MadSurge> Klumzeedragon: she totally is
<MadSurge> Hello Saturn! And yeah, that's relly adorable :3
<Ninjazz> Saturn, I agree.
<Ninjazz> Focusing on one thing while you should be looking at the entire picture.
<Klumzeedragon> xD That's silly.
<MASF123> Feel so tired.
<Moopy> Hey umm can some pony tell me what this video link is i don't know what it is
<Moopy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H40wUz-Fd8&feature=player_detailpage
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: good morrow to you my lord and master! what news have you?
<MASF123> This is sooo Un-Rainbow. D:
<Klumzeedragon> Moopy: There's a rainbow dash version of that now too.
<Ninjazz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcGHpy5Z3kE
<MASF123> Oh come on, I need to Dash! D:
<Moopy> Oh crap never mind i already know what that video link was
<DoctoDoctorWho> that awkward moment when 5 minutes later you realise its looping
<MASF123> I need to sleep, that's like the opposite of a Rainbow.
<Klumzeedragon> Rainbow sleeps a lot. :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> you will do nothing productive ever again http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygI-2F8ApUM&feature=related
<AdamTheDuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f0kPcxBx0E Piano cover is 20% cooler
<Klumzeedragon> Oh Brodyquest. You are used for so many things. :D
<MASF123> I've been Rainbow Dashing all day today, I need to sleep now. D:
<MadSurge> DoctoDoctorWho: aww yeah, no Molestia crap :D
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: i feel like shit! woo!
<Spectrum_Rush> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQjiX5KI9WE
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: but seriously, i've been up for about 24 hours straight now
<Saturn> 08,01again
<Klumzeedragon> MASF123: Theeeeen sleep! *throws clouds at MASF123*
<Saturn> 08,01i should stop doing this
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: yay! wait...
<Ninjazz> nonsense, Saturn. You're having fun!
<MadSurge> Saturn: so do you plan to go to bed?
<Saturn> 08,01Ninjazz: i feel simultaneously hot and cold, and i want to puke my guts out
<MASF123> only Pegasi can sleep on clouds. D:
<Saturn> 08,01what's not to love?
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: not for another few hours; i have meetings
<Klumzeedragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwe0daWswqc&feature=my_liked_videos&list=LLH5u48Qgmlwz6VInDtA1D3g
<Saturn> 08,01a cloud sounds mighty comfy right now
<Ninjazz> Saturn, I'd imagine a few people would buy expensice medication to get that feeling.
<Klumzeedragon> MASF123: Use it as a pillow. :)
<Saturn> 08,01but i tried that last night
<Ninjazz> expensive*
<MASF123> But I'm not a Pegasi. :(
<Saturn> 08,01turns out that in reality, clouds are really just noisey, hard, and unforgiving machines
<MASF123> My head will sink right through it. :/
<Klumzeedragon> MASF123: Put it in a pillow case. >_> Then use it as a pillow. We earth ponies can think of anything.
<Saturn> 08,01it's funny because i'm a cloud administrator.
<Saturn> 08,01and that's actually what i've spent all night doing
<Ninjazz> Ouch.
<Moopy> Hail to the king everypony
<MadSurge> Saturn: get a mountain of fluff and sleep on it
<Moopy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVZGNO0VVTA&feature=player_detailpage
<Ninjazz> Don't you delegate responsibilities?
<Klumzeedragon> Saturn: Machines? :P What kind of machine is the cloud? Sounds familiar.
<MASF123> I hate being an Earth pony. :|
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: Is there anything I can do to serve you my lord?
<MASF123> I have to use my brain to solve everyday problems. I can't use Magic or flying to get anywhere.
<Klumzeedragon> Moopy: Bruce Cambell is better than Duke Nukem. :P
<Klumzeedragon> MASF123: True~ But we work hard and have more knowledge in other aspects. :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> MASF123: well its nice being a unicorn I guess
<MASF123> No wing or horns...just a plain old horse that can speak.
<DoctoDoctorWho> MASF123: especially seeing where I went to college,
<Klumzeedragon> MASF123: And what's the problem with that? I we get along just fine~ Im an earth pony and I can't complain.
<MASF123> I do...only Earth pony that seems content is Pinkie Pie.
<MASF123> I didn't ask to be an Earth pony, but that's how Celestia/Lord Smooze made me. So now I have to live that way.
*MASF123 sighs
<DoctoDoctorWho> After spending 12 years under celestia in Celestia's school for gifted unicorns, I graduated and left for further schooling at the university of canterlot
<MadSurge> Hahaha are we discussing earth ponies? Thought noone had them as OC :D
<Klumzeedragon> Carrot Top, Big Mac, Cheerilee, Applejack. They all seem pretty content to me. :) They just work hard like eeeeeverypony else.
<DoctoDoctorWho> here's an add http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxy9mrKplzA
<Klumzeedragon> MadSurge: It appears that way. :D But I have an OC earth pony. :P
<Klumzeedragon> Enrol Now!
<MadSurge> Klumzeedragon: if I wasn't so lazy I would have one too :D
<MASF123> Anywho, I have to go bed...NOT ON THE CLOUDS or on a magial comfy bed, but on a plain bed.
<MadSurge> MASF123: bye! Have nice dreams!
<Saturn> 08,01Klumzeedragon: cloud computers
<Klumzeedragon> MASF123: Twilight and Rarity don't have magical beds. :P But enjoy a food nights sleep. :)
<Saturn> 08,01or rather, clusters that run cloud computing platforms
<Klumzeedragon> good*
<Klumzeedragon> MadSurge: Pony Generated mine and drew it. Still thinking on a colour and cutie mark. :D So Im lazy too.
<Saturn> 08,01applejack and rainbow dash would make adroable babies with each other
<Saturn> 08,01and before anyone questions it: magic.
<DoctoDoctorWho> MASF123: I feel the need to inform you that unicorns have normal beds too, and actually given the scarcity of cloud cities, much fewer pegasi have cloud beds than one would think...
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: actually, unicorns sleep upside-down in trees, like bats
<MadSurge> Saturn: what colors would they be? Green and purple? :D
<Klumzeedragon> But I see, Saturn. Doesnt sound very fun. :D But Im sure they would too. :P
<Klumzeedragon> MadSurge: Zap apple stripped?
<Ninjazz> Lies! Unicorns sleep like possums, not bats!
<Klumzeedragon> striped*
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: i'd think that the rainbow mane and tail is a genetic mutation, one that could potentially be passed down
<MadSurge> :D
<Saturn> 08,01though child colour seems to be somewhat random
<MadSurge> Inded
<MadSurge> *indeed
<Ninjazz> So Rainbow Dash's father had a rainbow moustache.
<Saturn> 08,01though you don't see many, well, any, rainbow maned ponies around
<Saturn> 08,01so maybe dash's colours is a brand new mutation
<Klumzeedragon> And I have noticed that all Unicorn magics colour seems to be based off eye colour. :P
<Ninjazz> A stylish one.
<Saturn> 08,01or a very rare one that requires 2 carriers in order for the trait to be expressed
<Ninjazz> Klumzeedragon, ikr? I've always noticed that.
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: Yuh. It always makes me do the Rarity "Pfft" when people call everypony with green magic a changling. :D
<Saturn> 08,01Ninjazz: how do possums sleep
<Moopy> Hey saturn how did it go on the train?
<Ninjazz> Saturn, upside down on trees, hanging from their tails.
<Saturn> 08,01Klumzeedragon: everypony is a changeling
<Saturn> 08,01nice
<Saturn> 08,01i did not know that
<Klumzeedragon> Saturn: :O
<Ninjazz> The more you know! ~*
<Moopy> hmmm cool
<Klumzeedragon> The shocking truth.
<Saturn> 08,01Moopy: it went fine, actually; i got to the airport 10 minutes before check-in closed, but i managed to make it to my plane
<Ninjazz> Klumzeedragon, actually, I've been noting inconsistensy with that for a while now.
<Moopy> thats good to hear
<Moopy> Did you get something to eat?
<Saturn> 08,01not until i was back home, no
<Saturn> 08,01i had no euros left
<Moopy> heh euros
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: Yeah, I never really noticed it until Flim and Flam me thinks. I kind of thought like, "They have no green in their fur or mane... how is their magic gre... EYES!"
<Ninjazz|Away> Grrrr.
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: Grr?
<Ninjazz> Disconnect.
<Klumzeedragon> Ah. :D Did you get my last thing about Flim and Flam?

<Klumzeedragon> therainbowvortex: Welcome back. :)
<Saturn> 08,01it's a bugger that i won't see him again until January
<Saturn> 08,01but! i will be spending about a month with him then
<Klumzeedragon> Aw. Well that sounds like it will make up for it. :)
<Saturn> 08,01then another few months away
<Saturn> 08,01then i graduate, and if we're still going strong, we might move in together
<therainbowvortex> hey is there no streem
<Klumzeedragon> Why so much time apart? :S
<Saturn> 08,01Klumzeedragon: he lives in the netherlands, i live in scotland
<Saturn> 08,01and i'm studying currently
<Ninjazz> Also, no Klumzeedragon, I did not.
*DoctoDoctorWho claps at therainbowvortex unamusedly
<Klumzeedragon> And nope therainbowvortex. Caramel stopped about an hour ago.
<Klumzeedragon> Saturn: Ah... Well hopefully that works out for you two. :) I know those long distance relationships are hard. Been there myself.
<Klumzeedragon> Ninjazz: Yeah, I never really noticed it until Flim and Flam me thinks. I kind of thought like, "They have no green in their fur or mane... how is their magic gre... EYES!"
<Saturn> 08,01Klumzeedragon: i told myself i'd never do one again
<Saturn> 08,01but this has a definite and quite near end to the long distance part
<Ninjazz> Klumzeedragon, I noticed it when I was comparing Twilight's and Rarity's aura's.
<therainbowvortex> okay who wants me to link the my little dashie lyabye i found today
<Ninjazz> Saturn, I do certainly hope things work out this time.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I just gave up on having any form of relationship awhile ago
<Klumzeedragon> Saturn: Been there too. :) But the heart wants what the heart wants. So I hope it really works for you.
<Klumzeedragon> therainbowvortex: Do it man! :D
