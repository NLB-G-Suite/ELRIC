<CiderIsForDrinking> Then silence...
<cades> What about Saphira?
<flutter_spin> Silverspoon: what stuff?

<Shizuka> 13think of it this way
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I took a walk during the movies (I had my phone so I could run back if stream went wrong). I felt a whole lot better.

<Reikim> So SuperBrony64, what's going to happen today?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RaveBrony: Yeah. I've been suffering from it lately.
<twilight_sprinkle> uhhh, gangnam style...i feel like going on a rant about how i hate it and how its a another step back for modern music
<cachi01|mobile> Silverspoon OPPAH GANGNAM STYLE
<RaveBrony> Aw....so thats why i dont get to see much...
<Silverspoon> 1,11Because randomness.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I think the worst is over for me now.
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: Oh dang, i know that feel x_x
<Sabershy> Hello everypony! :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, it's not the music
<CiderIsForDrinking> *awkward silence*
<cachi01|mobile> Erock made a gangnam style meets metal =D
<Dken2021> hai Sabershy
<Canadian_Brony> hi saber
<AJIsAwesome> Sabershy: Hello!
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's how out of the blue it is
<Dken2021> holy carp! http://derpy.me/bIHvp
<Canadian_Brony> ooops
<Canadian_Brony> hi Sabershy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. It's torture.
<twilight_sprinkle> hello Sabershy
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - i guarantee you, Gangnam Style is going to become the new RickRolling at the rate it's going
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's why people like it
<flutter_spin> holy carp! Dken2021
<MirrorImage> that being said, ALL CHAT: YOUR MISSION - turn Gangnam Style into the 'new Rick Roll'
<CrimsonPhoenix> does anyone here knows how Rick roll began?
<cades> unless you watch the movie first, then i guess it won't suck so bad
<Canadian_Brony> MirrorImage it hasn't already?
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: at least rickroll had good singing and a point to it, gangam style is just crappy pop thats catchy and earns them money, its all they need
<Spell-of-Gaming> Trolololo became the new Rickrolling a few years ago
<MirrorImage> Canadian_Brony - not that i know of
<Allegr0> I'm baaaack
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Check Know Your Meme.
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix it began as Duckroll on a image board somewhere

<Dken2021> you do not realize how much I had to search for this song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX68XhPs--k
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess.
<RaveBrony> Yeah, lol
<Phase4> 00,02i cant get my beta key for smite to work

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat LadyCanary :D
<Reikim> No, I mean, I bet most of us here are IRL messed.
<Phase4> 00,02this thing is full of bugs i somehow manage to find
<LadyCanary> ^_^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Reikim> In our own special ways, some of which are more obvious than others.
<Unnr> Ohai LC! o/
<Reikim> And some of which are easier to cope with than others.
<Barbetos> Where are you putting it in Phase4?
<Phase4> Aspergers, depression, minor fragile x, anxiety
<sub06905> ^
<Quick_Thinker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyZFP-skjRM SOME ONE PLAY BREAKDOWN ALREADY I WANT TO SEE A LETS PLAY OF IT
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<Phase4> ^ dats me
<Canadian_Brony> Incoming Whose Line http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW9OvfpY7N0
<Reikim> At least here in regs, we really don't have a right to be intolerant.
<Phase4> 00,02Barbetos, ingame
<Cypresswolf> :)...what shall I post tonight...so many vids to choose from....
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You have Aspergers?
<otakon> yay
<Reikim> And we watch bloody ponies, for Celestia's sake.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or are you just being general?
<otakon> Whose Line
<Barbetos> Phase4 what is it exactly?
<Reikim> General.
<Spell-of-Gaming> SuperBrony64: Play Just Dance on Wii and make sure there's a cam. :D
<Canadian_Brony> Cypresswolf I'm covering
<Canadian_Brony> dammit
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, high functioning
<Reikim> I've got my own issues that I don't talk about because that would mean self-analysis and that ends badly.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Spell-of-Gaming: Oh mai o////o
<Canadian_Brony> I'm covering "Whose Line"
<Phase4> thats the only qualifier anyone has attached to it
<Cypresswolf> I have nothing whose line related
<RaveBrony> I know i have My fair share of problems
<Reikim> And psychology doesn't work well with a mirror.
<Polydunami> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtorTGaqf5Q This is a funny Whose Line
<Phase4> the anxiety might not be a condition and rathter an aritfact of aspergers, i'm mostly over it now
<Barbetos> is it for Smite Phase4?
<otakon> yes
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Cypresswolf> I'll just share my new findings
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami I love that one
<Barbetos> Ah okay. You need to put it in at a website: https://account.hirezstudios.com/login.aspx
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've been accused of having it, and I'm wondering if I do. I'm intelligent and an excellent problem solver, but I have social problems.
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf6__NZ3Hgg Her voice still gets to me. "Hush Now, Quiet Now" cover
<sub06905> Just Dance looks fun
<Reikim> Welcome to the ranks of most intelligent people on this Earth.

<Phase4> 00,02THANK YOU
<Phase4> 00,02IT FINALLY WORKED
<Barbetos> Login, and then look for the Games tab, then activate key I think
<Barbetos> Nice
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I mean, I took high-level math for fun in college.
<Phase4> 00,02Barbetos, i was trying that, but my old account is bugged
<RaveBrony> I have great social skills, but regardless of how much i love problem solving, i suck at it :D
<cades> imagine an internet, where there were no arguments whatsoever
<Barbetos> I have it too, but yet to play it. Let me know if you do decided to try it Phase4. I will join you.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can learn a coding language quickly.
<Barbetos> Old account? Did you play Global Agenda?
<Canadian_Brony> STREAM
<MirrorImage> suddenly, XBOX?
<sub06905> dat xbox
<Quick_Thinker> xbox suddenly
<otakon> it's SuperBrony64
<Canadian_Brony> I see Xbox. I'm guessing SB
<Phase4> 00,02otakon, want a key?
<otakon> BIONIC COMMANDO
<Quick_Thinker> TIME TO ADD A GMAERTAG
<Reikim> Most intelligent people have to deal with social issues or something else.
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2HCls6LmOc - Pinkie Pie is watching you (possible nightmare fuel)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But making friends is harder than solving int(e^(-x^2)) dx.
<Kimori> no arguements?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, maybe not that hard.
<Barbetos> Oh and I am so excited for Brony Fan Fare. Getting to meet fellow brony state bronies will be best birthday present ever
<Rustymeat> oh superbrony is streamingÉ
<RaveBrony> So you can help me with any math questions i have? :$
<flutter_spin> STREAM
<twilight_sprinkle> heres an interesting articale about modern pop music http://www.gizmag.com/pop-music-trends/23535/

<Dken2021> ah, doing another one of those parties?
<Quick_Thinker> i think otakon ragequit
<Ponies47> Dang you computer
<Spell-of-Gaming> XBOX?
<otakon> Phase4: I'll pass, give it to someone who would truly enjoy it
<Reikim> Why? Because life is like a DnD game, and we only have so many points to spend.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Could solve that with a taylor series XD
<Spell-of-Gaming> :L
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01See.
<Rustymeat> H GODNESS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm doing math!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
*RaveBrony starts college in a week
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Whoever has an Xbox 360 and Xbox Live Gold is free to join my party :)
<Phase4> 00,02FSCK YEAH, BORDERLESS WINDOWED MODE
<Phase4> 00,02i could stream this
<sub06905> to bad i dont have a Gold membership currently :<
<Reikim> Anyone who can combine insane intelligence and social skill without a lot of practice is hax and ought to be either nerfed or banned.
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: i do, its awesome
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm thinking of going back to school.
<RaveBrony> Lol!
<Quick_Thinker> XBOX HURRY UP AND POWER ON
<FlutterShyFan8895> Anypony have psn?
<MirrorImage> eh, i'm going to go play some Brave Fencer Musashi. Swear that game should've been on the t100 list earlier
<flutter_spin> what are you playing?
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, social interaction just doesnt quite make sense to you?
<DashWithRainbows> SuperBrony64 Too bad it's 5:34am here mate. I think I've spoken to you before.
<Dken2021> FlutterShyFan8895 I got one, but no PSP/PS3
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: it even allows me to order soda from the bronystate fridge
<Cypresswolf> aww...:) Can't post the next vid - but if you havent seen it, look up The Garden by mmmandarineorange
<Quick_Thinker> gO FASTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRr
<Spell-of-Gaming> Maybe we're gonna watch G4.
<CiderIsForDrinking> My computer decided to be a silly filly and hibernate on me ._.
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: Sorry. I don't have either. :<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No. It's just complicated.
<sub06905> my gold membership ran out 4 days ago :<
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh dear
<Dken2021> hey therer CiderIsForDrinking
<sub06905> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't like to go out and do things frequently.
<DashWithRainbows> Although, I might be on in about... 25 mins SB.
<Phase4> heres the big one that tells you wether or not you have aspergers
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Come on, we can't have a live Pony reaction video without ponies willing to talk in the party :D
<RaveBrony> Nor do i
<Reikim> People are more complicated than high-level mathematics. Science fact.
<Phase4> Nittany_Discord, when you see someone who's sad, do you also feel sad
<twilight_sprinkle> i would talk so much id have people wishing id shut up
<Sabershy> SuperBrony64: AkamaruZX is me...
<cades> i think the universe would blow up
<DashWithRainbows> Wait 25 mins SB, then I should be on.
<flutter_spin> I didn't have gold for like a year
<RaveBrony> I hate actually going to meet people, but if i have to (say like, for class) I will.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do hate to see people sad.
<Dken2021> love to , but I don't have a 360, and even if I do, my connection might be crap anyways
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Unfortunately, I can't capture my voice on stream, but if you're in the party, you'll hear me :)
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 ponies? You should have warned me in advance! I'll grab the Fresca
<Reikim> Phase, isn't that one for psychopaths? Lack of empathy?
<FlutterShyFan8895> Skype anyone? i have to leave text chat to go on my ps3 :(
<flutter_spin> SB - whatcha playing?
<Phase4> does it trigger an intrinsc emotional response though
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's just in real life, I never know how to comfort them.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially females.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know Phase4.
<flutter_spin> Aegis Wing? :P
<Phase4> your a maybe
<RaveBrony> Females are so bad for me, its my male friends i dont know how to comfort x_x
<RaveBrony> *arent
<flutter_spin> Castle Crashers?
<Phase4> Reikim, probably, had i grown up different i could be a very not nice person
<flutter_spin> Scott Pilgrim?
<Reikim> No I mean
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: If only you we're doign htis on teh computer and on Skype :/
<Reikim> Psychopaths aren't necessarily bad, look at Meanwhile.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I kind-of choose to stay away from it.
<Ponies47> *this
<Polydunami> What have you in mind?
<Canadian_Brony> this is one time I kidna want a 360, but I'd have to pay alot just to stay online, which is total bullsh*t.
<Spell-of-Gaming> We're gonna watch ponies on XBOX
<Spell-of-Gaming> :I
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate assholes and fear them a bit IRL.
<Ponies47> *the
<CiderIsForDrinking> Castle Crashers!
<CiderIsForDrinking> :D
<FlutterShyFan8895> should make a mobile Brony app
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Since even a little criticism can hurt me.
<Reikim> Psychopaths just have a demonstrable lack of empathy and sense of social responsibility. In a sense they're just disjointed.
<flutter_spin> You do realize they are putting Castle Crashers on Steam, right?
<Phase4> but yeah, empathy is one of the things that people aspergers lack, you have to learn it
<Cypresswolf> :) If Im still up after this stream (if noone else takes over) I'll post the bedtime story again ;)
<Quick_Thinker> um SB64 it says you odnt exist
<DashWithRainbows> brb, I'll get my xbox set up now.
<Quick_Thinker> at all
<Spell-of-Gaming> Wut
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Guess I don't exist :<
<Dken2021> hello voice
<Spademagnes[R]> What is going on?
<Polydunami> Oh I get it he's playing Wolfenstein 3D! :3
<AdamTheDuck> yay a voice
<otakon> who's voice is that?
<DashWithRainbows> SuperBrony64 You exist in the silly universe.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If someone comes in depressed IRL, I wouldn't know how to act.
<RaveBrony> What is aspergers exactly?
<Phase4> the theory that makes most sense to me is that aspergers is a lack of 'mirror neurons'
<FlutterShyFan8895> wolfenstein!!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:D
<flutter_spin> hello
<Quick_Thinker> can i get your xbox gamer tag in chat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's a light form of autism.
<Quick_Thinker> maybe the xbox is crazy
<Canadian_Brony> Spell-of-Gaming Americans get MLP: FiM on Netflix, where as we up here get 1/3 of the US's norm. Ponies are cut off our list as well.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01From what I read.
<Phase4> RaveBrony, one of the many, many , MANY forms of autism
<Quick_Thinker> fuck it mines Owning The Hand
<Canadian_Brony> Netflix Canada! Y U no have ponies?
<flutter_spin> lol
<Spademagnes[R]> Woah
<flutter_spin> KILL ME
<Spademagnes[R]> What
<Reikim> Aspergers is, I believe a form of high-functioning autism, characterized by lack of empathy among other stuff.
*cachi01|mobile kills flutter_spin
<Spell-of-Gaming> OH god kids
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's actually fairly new since the disease didn't officially exist when I was born.
<Spademagnes[R]> Meh I havent done much today, been playing alot of Mario Kart 7 and Starforce 3
<Phase4> the best way i can descirbe it emotinally is detatched
<RaveBrony> I dont fully know what autism is either. I hear it all the time, but never really read up on it.
<Reikim> Basically, Aspergers is social awkwardness in genetic form.
<Ponies47> If anypony cares. My Skype is "Ponies47" if you care to add me. :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I care about things. I care too much in fact.
<Reikim> Also, Nitt, Aspergers has been around since 1944.
<cachi01|mobile> Canadian_Brony same here at mexico
<flutter_spin> dat random singing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I care too much about what people think sometimes.
<Phase4> i have all the emotions, i have all the senses, i get the signals from body language, but they dont 'connect'
<Spademagnes[R]> Pony should pony pony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Reikim: Didn't know what.
<otakon> SuperBrony64: what is your LIVE tag man?
<cachi01|mobile> My skype is cachi01^_^
<Dken2021> Ponies47 kay I guess, I have a skype but no one to talk to
<flutter_spin> WHOA
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01|mobile atleast Youtube has every ep.
<Spademagnes[R]> WOAH
<Spademagnes[R]> JESUS
<AJIsAwesome> Spademagnes[R]: Hey! What's up?
<Spell-of-Gaming> WUT
<Canadian_Brony> Hi there!
<otakon> yes he is Pinkies4thWall
<Phase4> aspergers has existed for as long as humans where humans :P
<Ponies47> Dken2021: Plenty of ponies on Bstate on Skype XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But anyway, the fact that I'm so sensitive to criticism is why I don't like online gaming.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat preloaded Xbox 360 music...
<Phase4> infact i had a cat you could call autistic
<Dken2021> if anyone wants my skype, it's dken2021
<SuperBrony64> 11,02otakon: SuperBrony64 :)
<MASF123> Wuuut...
<otakon> o
<Reikim> Issues with social interaction, narrow interests, speech issues, lack of empathy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because I hate how people get so hateful there.
<otakon> makes sense actually
<RaveBrony> Autism is where people cant communicate well?
<Quick_Thinker> well SB64 your xbox gamertag would help to know
<Reikim> Motion and motor control, gaze avoidance
<Quick_Thinker> just saying
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unfortunately, I can become just as bad as them.
<Ponies47> MY EARS!
<Reikim> Other stuff
<Canadian_Brony> I'm not even logged into Skype. Hogs RAM.
<Phase4> RaveBrony, its more than that but yeah
<FlutterShyFan8895> i added you ponies47
<Kiryu> minecraft! :P
<RaveBrony> Ah...
<Reikim> Also, Aspergers hasn't been around forever.
<flutter_spin> Minecraft?
<Reikim> It was a mutation that cropped up at some point, and keeps cropping up.
<DashWithRainbows> Awwwwkward.
<flutter_spin> lol
<Canadian_Brony> ohai DashWithRainbows.
<Phase4> thats possible, but its a fairly common mutation
<flutter_spin> naw. Talk about ponies.
<DashWithRainbows> Howdy Canadian_Brony.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Youve been X'ed! Your on the Jamie Kennedy Experiment! :D
<Reikim> Either that or the human mind is just really fucked up...which it is.
<Canadian_Brony> DashWithRainbows when did you aquire the '+'?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It is.
<flutter_spin> LOL
<flutter_spin> wut?
<Polydunami> Smile! You're on Candid Camera! :)
<Spademagnes[R]> What
<Quick_Thinker> BULLSHIT he doesnt exist
<RaveBrony> My ex's bro had autism... i tried talking to the guy and i got th esleeper hold and a knife to my face... :'(
<AJIsAwesome> Why don't you have a seat right there? Just take a seat right there.
<flutter_spin> The size of Trixies horn?
<DashWithRainbows> Canadian_Brony Saxy set the mode I think today since I'm part of the art team.
<Canadian_Brony> ok
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd like to see research advance to where we can treat and cure mental disorders without medications, ECT (brain zaps), or surgery.
<Kiryu> PONY'S! :[
<Phase4> the human mind is what you get if you have a billion monkies randomly connect neoruons and build a brain, one of them happens to work
<Reikim> That's called therapy and it works to an extent.
<twilight_sprinkle> ew ponies
<Phase4> its the ultimate form of order from chaos
<twilight_sprinkle> ponies are gay.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> UHF yes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Therapy worked well for me.
<flutter_spin> heh. RockaDoodle
<Quick_Thinker> there we fuckin go
<Reikim> Therapy is the way to treat mental disorders.
<cachi01|mobile> Ponies? Ponies are for little girls =P
<flutter_spin> old movie.
<Phase4> therapy never worked for me
<Reikim> More or less.
<RaveBrony> Ive never been to therapy... although ive been told i need it..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But since I've been out of it and since moving back home, I relapsed into severe depression.
<twilight_sprinkle> dat anime
<Reikim> Well that sucks.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah man i was kid when i saw that,classic
<Polydunami> Oh nuts
<flutter_spin> anime? :( anything else?
<Phase4> all you could do to me was show me whats going on, i had to figure it out
<DashWithRainbows> Dat Wilfred image
<Rex_Mundi> Im in love with a pony
<AJIsAwesome> Please, no Rosario.
<twilight_sprinkle> dat fanservice on the cover
<Polydunami> MUSHISHI
<DashWithRainbows> Nothing is better than a guy licking another guy's face.
<Spell-of-Gaming> SGT FROG
<LadyCanary> Rosario?
<Spell-of-Gaming> OH GOD YES
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: which pony?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And therapy is expensive.
<Reikim> I've been threatened with therapy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it works wonders.
<LadyCanary> As in Rosario Vampire? HEHEE NO. Manga is much better.
<flutter_spin> I liked Neds Declassified
<AdamTheDuck> Ruby Gloom? :3
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: I love Ned's Declassified.
<Rex_Mundi> Currently, Applejack
<LadyCanary> Danny Phantom? Danny Phantom.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Gabriel Iglesias
<twilight_sprinkle> jimmy neutron
<DashWithRainbows> Oh ho ho, Happy tree friends.
<flutter_spin> no. Not any Happy Tree Friends
<Ponies47> Dken2021: What's your Skype username?
<Reikim> Therapy...
<cachi01|mobile> AjIsAwesome same here
<RaveBrony> All i do when im depressed or upset about something is 'verbally' beat the hell out of myself in the mirror... Maybe thats why i need therapy :D
<Dken2021> Ponies47 dken2021
<LadyCanary> I think we already saw that episode.
<Ponies47> flutter_spin: Oh God no! D:
<twilight_sprinkle> boooo ponies are gay
<Reikim> I couldn't stand the idea of wasting the time on it.
<Spademagnes[R]> Oh boy this one
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I had therapy during my last semester of college. It wiped my depression and anxiety out and got my life in order.
<cachi01|mobile> Dken2021 i added you :)
<Kiryu> I came here for ponies dang it! :[
<Spell-of-Gaming> Hearts and Hooves Day?
<Reikim> Too much to do, not enough time.
<RaveBrony> I dont know any other way to deal with such things
<Spell-of-Gaming> Nonononononono.
<Ponies47> Dken2021: Okie
<flutter_spin> PAUNCH
<Reikim> Nothing happens at the right time.
<Dken2021> cachi01|mobile yaI got ya
<twilight_sprinkle> needs a little bit more GLITTER
<Spademagnes[R]> It needs more glitter!
<Reikim> I'm never at my laptop when I'm inspired.
<Dken2021> it needs all the glitter!
<Spademagnes[R]> Alot of glitter!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol YES
<flutter_spin> Why this episode though?
<Rex_Mundi> G3 ponies would be fun to watch
<Spademagnes[R]> I vote for yes!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> riff it!!!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02flutter_spin: Because it's there.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> RIFF
<Spademagnes[R]> SO awesome dash
<flutter_spin> lol
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> RIFF
<Spell-of-Gaming> RIFFTRAX PLS
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> RIFF
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I spend too much time on here. That's why I took a walk today.
<twilight_sprinkle> goddamnit, that ytp ruined this episode for me forever
<Rex_Mundi> in order to make fun of that is
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It had the chance to /NOT/ be there, but it chose to exist, therefore, we must watch it.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol was that a JAWS reference?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because being here wasn't doing anything to make me feel better.
<twilight_sprinkle> inb4 france
<flutter_spin> ^^
<Dken2021> and all the desynci
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But walking half a mile worked wonders.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: That's why I don't watch pony ytps anymore.
<Spademagnes[R]> JAPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!
<DashWithRainbows> SuperBrony64 That, and CheriMac 5ever.
<flutter_spin> Funny hearing your voice SB
<RaveBrony> Oh... do you want us to change the subject then?
<Quick_Thinker> man im bored
<Canadian_Brony> dammit, computer's being a d*ck
<Reikim> Nah, it was being here in general.
<flutter_spin> BIG
<Spademagnes[R]> And sucks
<Kiryu> time to sing the song of our people! :)
<Reikim> Although manechat could depress anyone, at times.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: it wouldve been easier to forget if Nittany didnt stream it every time :P
<RaveBrony> Yeah.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol it id
<flutter_spin> scuffed up floor
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> *is
<Spell-of-Gaming> I swear to God, I remember CheriMac starting the shipping wars against Fluttermac.
<Spademagnes[R]> MIND BLOWN
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cheerliee's a whore.
<Ponies47> When I was younger "Happy Tree Friends" scared the (squee) outta me O~O

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01twilight_sprinkle: Me too. Sorry. XD
<Polydunami> I don't really pay attention to shipping conflicts :P
<Canadian_Brony> this episode is pretty light on the drinking
<sub06905> sus
<Rex_Mundi> G2 Bon bon was a fat pony too
<Reikim> And half of them, at least, aren't really all that great conversation.
<CiderIsForDrinking> I had to take care of a Trojan virus in my computer, did I miss anything?
<Reikim> It's really a problem of numbers.
<Polydunami> Damn those Trojans
<Reikim> Too many people, less of a chance of good conversation.
<FlutterShyFan8895> not much
<AJIsAwesome> I stopped watching pony ytps becuase it ruined the episodes and the characters as well for me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And average age.
<Spademagnes[R]> YESBECAUSE THIS IS HOW LOVE WORKS
<flutter_spin> CiderIsForDrinking: SB is streaming with a bunch of xbox friends
<twilight_sprinkle> can i keep you?..
<RaveBrony> Mhhm
<cachi01|mobile> Confound these trojans
<Reikim> Mental age, let's mind.
<twilight_sprinkle> cheerilees a whoooore
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's why things like Maid Hour are more dangerous to do.
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|mobile: CONFOUND THOSE DOVER BOYS!
<Spell-of-Gaming> CHEERILEE'S A WHOOOORE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Since the teenagers will throw it to R34.
<Canadian_Brony> Song! DRINK!!
<Ponies47> Skype why you derp out on me!?!?! :[
<flutter_spin> I love her voice RIGHT HERE
<Polydunami> Michelle did both Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom
<RaveBrony> Yeah... i remember it awhile ago. Such a fun hour :)
<Reikim> I'm sure there are some younger viewers who are quite mature, and older viewers who are not.
<Spademagnes[R]> FUNERAL
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But...i liek silleh :<
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat funeral
<Spademagnes[R]> IT IS CANNON
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You're right. It's maturity.
<Reikim> Average mental age is still down the tubes, though.
<flutter_spin> Caramel
<cachi01|mobile> Polydunami just the singing voice
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: thats you?O.o
<Spademagnes[R]> Damn it Caramel
<Polydunami> I meant this song :S

<Spademagnes[R]> Super fast!
<Reikim> And then I move over here pretty much permanently.
<Phase4> but they talk about boobies, thats mature right :P
<Athgaar> qbert ponies
<Spademagnes[R]> Yup!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> eeyup
<AJIsAwesome> CUE CREDITS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If we had more maturity in chat, things like RP would be more acceptable since we wouldn't have to worry about people taking it too far.
*twilight_sprinkle bashes his head on the keyboard in an attempt to forget the YTP
<RaveBrony> You get those people who just want to destroy it for others.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> cue credits
<otakon> I don't know what ARE doing SuperBrony64?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Q-bert
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: it will never leave
*AJIsAwesome joins with twilight_sprinkle
<Spademagnes[R]> No!
<Reikim> Hey
<Reikim> We should do Maid Hour in here.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: IT WILL NEVER LEAVE
<SuperBrony64> 11,02idk, what ARE doing is doing?
<Eulshy> what are we watching?
<flutter_spin> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: :'(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe.
<Spademagnes[R]> Wow that lag
<Reikim> I assume we're all mature enough.
<Canadian_Brony> This episode is really light on the drinking according to my list.
<flutter_spin> Heart and Hooves on SB's xbox with a party of friends
<Phase4> problem is /nick will show up in #bronystate too
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: it's lIVE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Reikim> Damn, that's true.
<Polydunami> What YTP?
<flutter_spin> those cute eyes
<AJIsAwesome> I wonder what would happen if he used both legs...........
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i knew i shouldnt have watched ytps for this show..
<Fangrend> is it juat me or is it hard not to sing along with them
<Spademagnes[R]> She'll buck him!
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: it'll ruin your mind
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And if people start changing to their maid nicks, it'll trigger a maid hour in main.
<Phase4> as long as the average maturity is high enough, chats can regulate themselves
<RaveBrony> I remember when i first came to Bronystate, theres was a bit of RP, but it was silly and didnt get out of hand.
<Kimori> lol what are you talking about
<flutter_spin> lol.
<otakon> inb4 PAWNCH
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Same here. It KILLS the episode and the characters.
<Canadian_Brony> so far, I am on 1 drink for this episode.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: it already has. just like the time i was watching a crapton of hitler parodies, when walked out i kept seeing hitlers out of the corner of my eye
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RP issues started with a mod we had called Octavia.
<RaveBrony> Smacking others with fish, and 'throwing' things
<sub06905> Wow i didnt know they had a MLP FIM orchestra album :)
<flutter_spin> That's Fluttershy.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> you dont say?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Reikim> History lesson?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When people would RP about her butt.
<Canadian_Brony> dat apple tree
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Scootaloo is best CMC Pony.
<Spademagnes[R]> Bloomberg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All about Octavia's plot.
<RaveBrony> O.o
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I disagree
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 agreed
<Eulshy> whats with the backround talk?
<twilight_sprinkle> false, Sweetie is best cmc
<Reikim> ...What.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Ah those days =P
<sub06905> Scootaloo is best cmc
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> No Applebloom
<RaveBrony> Wait, the Octavia we helped in the charity?
<flutter_spin> Eulshy: group of people :P

<Sabershy> Totally Applebloom
<JESmith71> Eh this is amusing, SB doing commentary on it this time
<Eulshy> Sweetie Belle is best pony BTW
<AJIsAwesome> How did that hammer not fall on Applebloom's head?
<Spademagnes[R]> Equestria gets XBL?
<otakon> Eulshy: it's the LIVE party that SuperBrony64 is apart of, and one of them is watching the stream on PC
<RaveBrony> Wasnt here whe Octavia was a mod :(
<otakon> Spademagnes[R]: it's Netflix
<RaveBrony> *I wasnt
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Can you hear me? o.o
<Celes_Chere> Scootaloo needs her own episode
<FlutterShyFan8895> i gotta go use my ps3 now:(.... bye everypony!:)
<otakon> Pinkies4thWall: turn your PC down
<flutter_spin> I hear tons of voices
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Yes.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I don't want Maid Hour to ever become the next Octavia's Plot.
<flutter_spin> Is that bad?
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 I dunno. Say "Rainbow Dash is best pony."
<otakon> no no no
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man those EYES :$ so cute lol

<flutter_spin> ^^
<Reikim> And I fail to see how being a maid leads there.
<RaveBrony> I missed like, 1 and then the next time it was brought up, i remember Nitt telling me that some stuff went down.
<Canadian_Brony> I am on 5 drinks for this episode.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: ok, her and diamond tiara

<twilight_sprinkle> Be that giiiiirl!~
<Reikim> Assuming all goes well.
<RaveBrony> I wouldnt Dare get the leaked stuff tho... that was quite a shame...
<AJIsAwesome> I'm guessing Applebloom secretly wants a piggie back ride...
<Reikim> I think Fluttershy's almsot done, based on evidence.
<CiderIsForDrinking> Buffered in midair
<Reikim> They went looking for her VA a while ago, I took that to mean they had progress.
<twilight_sprinkle> heeeres SHMOOPY DOO
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> No use for doors...
<Spademagnes[R]> SCREW DOORS AGAIN!
<cachi01|mobile> Ponies47 u going to canterlot gardens roght?

<DashWithRainbows> Cheerilee is a TAAAANK
<cachi01|mobile> Right*
<Ponies47> cachi01|mobile: Most likely
<Ponies47> Why?
<Reikim> So, I guess we'll see Fluttershy as a character release...sometime in the fall, and then Rainbow Dash with the full release.
<cachi01|mobile> Ponies47 say hello to max gilardi for me lol
<RaveBrony> You get all this info on the main site? I dont really keep up with it :o

<SaxyPretender> 0,14iirc, they're planning to have everyone playable at Canterlot Gardens
<Reikim> I get some info and then I postulate.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and that's in two months
<AJIsAwesome> To be honest, this is my opinion on shipping. If you do though, you're welcome to.
<Spademagnes[R]> Your flanks are so grounded
<RaveBrony> What ever happened to PonyKart? I heard about that a While ago, but dont hear anytihng else about it.
<Reikim> Saxy, if that happens, I will cry manly tears of joy.
<Reikim> Ponykart's still up.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> moral: shipping is bad and you should feel bad!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I thought the FiM team as going to stop doing updates since their game got leaked?
<Reikim> It's open source, they've got a background character designer open.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Derpy's flank was grounded.
<Cypresswolf> Unless a pony has magic ability, hoof made construction isnt put together well - how do those houses stay up in the first place?
<twilight_sprinkle> no pony can pony two ponies to pony
<Dken2021> PaladinDrakkenwolf unless it's an official one
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: They revoked that, here I'll get you a link...
<Polydunami> I don't pay any attention to shipping :P
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: I thought the same thing

<Reikim> They were amazingly chill about it after they calmed down a bit.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Dken2021: but aside from Cadence and Shining Armor, there is no canon ships out there
<Canadian_Brony> I'm not into shipping, but if you are then I'm cool with it. Just don't force me into a conversation about it. I will drone on forever.
<Spademagnes[R]> That tease
<Reikim> And then a bit later they released the full RD stage theme, which is badass.
<Spademagnes[R]> Next!
<cachi01|mobile> PaladinDrakkenwolf ms cake and mr cake
<otakon> brb
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> oh right...
<otakon> THat needs the caption: U MAD BRO?"
<DashWithRainbows> I still prefer the leaked version of RD's theme. You can tell the difference between the two though.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And you can think about how sos you are when you're...
<Spademagnes[R]> Is it just me or am I the only one who cant get Friendship is fabulous out of my head?
<Polydunami> Some peep is behind somewhere :P
<JESmith71> Play Friend in Deed and try to sing Smile
<AJIsAwesome> If you ship more power to you. I won't judge. But don't shove shipping down my throat. I've HAD it with other fanbases doing that to me.
<Reikim> I prefer the more refined version.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same
<otakon> R.O.D.!
<Reikim> It's smoother.

<Polydunami> The trouble is that teens actually take pointers from shows like this :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> >6teen
<Reikim> Personally, I think the full version is just more balanced, tweaked, and altogether easier to listen to.
<RaveBrony> Wow, this theme fits RD very well :D
<Spademagnes[R]> POR QUE
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Would you like some Chlorofor instead?

<Canadian_Brony> Dken2021 compared to the PC version, it is very outdated. They recently got wolves.
<otakon> YES YOU DO
<Phase4> oh

<Reikim> Yes

<SuperBrony64> 11,02o.o
<Dken2021> I guess it's good for if your PC is crap at running it
<Reikim> So far as I know, he does the art for all his songs.
<sonicandmario85> Dken2021:or you just like the xbox
<Reikim> He's mentioned he'd like to pursue his art over his music. I had a slight panic attack.

<Buytoast> me oh my, it seems that i, have struck a nerve
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Nope. Just watch what you say.:)
<Canadian_Brony> found the lava, eh?
<Buytoast> man, you must have not been coming here for very long
<otakon> SKin Packs
<AJIsAwesome> I didn't even know they were instrument blocks in Minecraft. Cool.
<Buytoast> treating crap as a curse word
<Buytoast> oh wow
<RaveBrony> So soothing :o
<Reikim> I have cried listening to that song.
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome "Note Blocks" you right-click them to change the note and put different blocks underneath it to change the instrument. You can either punch it once or power it with redstone to have it play a note.
<Reikim> I wrote a whole fanfic using (mostly) that song as inspiration.
<Canadian_Brony> Quick_Thinker is taken . . .
<Reikim> And it's probably the best thing I've ever written.
<Canadian_Brony> hmmph
<Spademagnes[R]> I assume the cobble is blocked off lava
<Reikim> If I could have a song played at my funeral it would be that song.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Cool! Stuff like gol and diamonds are only used for appearance right? They don't have any real use?

<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome godl and diamons are some of the most useful things in Minecraft. Diamonds can be used to make the strongest tools and armour in the game. Gold can make quick but fragile tools and show-offy armour, but it should be used to make clocks, powered rails, and other numerous goodies.
<RaveBrony> :o
<Spademagnes[R]> Pinkie snort
<Spademagnes[R]> Spy snort
<Reikim> So that's how I got into Touhou.

<Athgaar> mining dirt
<otakon> guys I'm gonna go to bed soon I think
<otakon> it's near 2 am here
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome however, blocks of Gold or Diamond are used as decoration. A PC update will give them use, but for now it can be used to make things look pretty and brag on servers.

<Reikim> I have far more Touhou than ponies, and it is all awesome.
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: NIght!

<Canadian_Brony> sub06905 *again
<Canadian_Brony> Daaaahhh
<Buytoast> i ain't bein that bad today
<sub06905> Canadian_Brony: he did before? :D
<sub06905> dat lava
<Canadian_Brony> sub06905 yeah. Twice.
<sub06905> lol
<Ponies47> But Buytoast your not even a brony, What do you do whenwe're watching ponies? O.O
<twilight_sprinkle> dat name
<cowvarkian> that was me
<Buytoast> hey now, i enjoy the show, i just hate the ponyfags
<Buytoast> and it depends on the episode
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: whats a ponyfag then?
<Ponies47> Buytoast: Oh. Sorry :$
<Canadian_Brony> the ones who hate the show and won't shut up about it, or the ones who force you to be a brony?
<Buytoast> the people of the my little pony fandom that are absolutely disgusting and terrible
<Athgaar> ____fag isn't always derogatory
<Buytoast> and force it everywhere
<Canadian_Brony> Don't we all?
<DashWithRainbows> Buytoast By ponyfag, I'm guessing you mean bronies who spout "love and tolerate." and post pony related things on things that are not pony related?
<Canadian_Brony> they give us a bad rep
<Buytoast> mainly yes
<Athgaar> ponyfag can mean any pony fan
<Canadian_Brony> holy sh*t dat lava
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: true, thats annoying, but tbh there are worse people than that in the community
<Buytoast> oh, i know there are
<twilight_sprinkle> psychological entertainment
<Athgaar> *physical
<twilight_sprinkle> psychological
<Athgaar> you don't know that
<Athgaar> or do you
<twilight_sprinkle> im guessing
<twilight_sprinkle> since i can understand that
<Athgaar> aight sorry
<Buytoast> man, i ain't even starting shit and people are gettin riled up
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: youre just that good :D
<Ponies47> You see when I was still a young brony. The top thing to do was make my brother into a brony. Lucky for me CrimsonPhoenix knocked some sense into me before I got TO carried away :$
<Canadian_Brony> and suddenly daimond
<twilight_sprinkle> a big beautiful bedazzling DIAMOND
<Canadian_Brony> . . .
<Petrified_Discord> twilight_sprinkle: It's a STONE, Luigi.

<Canadian_Brony> O_O
<Canadian_Brony> I get it now
<Canadian_Brony> tooke me that long
<twilight_sprinkle> <3
<Dken2021> Ponies47 ah, I was like that too, but then I realize it's just another fan thing, and I didn't do this withthe other thigns I like
<twilight_sprinkle> the sprinkle part is actually her pornstar name from a ytp...but i just like it cuz it sounds cute :3
<Canadian_Brony> I didn't have to know that
<Buytoast> ah yes
<Buytoast> hot
<Buytoast> pony
<Buytoast> dick
<Canadian_Brony> I don't want to know that
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: the more you know ~

<Ponies47> Night Spademagnes[R]
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Spademagnes[R]
<Buytoast> ah futanari
<Canadian_Brony> I need to stay up and fill out an application from
<Canadian_Brony> *form
<DashWithRainbows> I think I have.
<Buytoast> there's a few
<DashWithRainbows> I prefer images to clopfics.
<Ponies47> So. I have my student ID for high school already. Still a bit nervoius :S
<Buytoast> you better not be jerkin to ponies
<DashWithRainbows> <_<
<DashWithRainbows> >_>
<Athgaar> this is the internet
<DashWithRainbows> Don't be silly!
<Athgaar> we get off to absolutely everything
<Buytoast> if it's humanized have at it
<Buytoast> but if not then go find a farm instead
<DashWithRainbows> Um, no.
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 We get new ID's every year. We get them after half of the first semester is over.
<Canadian_Brony> dat Swedish hair fact
<Dken2021> but I don't ant to be the guy, you see the things the kid has to deal with? floating apples, spikes, it's too much for me
<DashWithRainbows> Humanized, yes. Anthro, yes. Pony? No thanks mate.
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: I see. I get mine when I turn in the boring paperwork :$
<Cypresswolf> My temper gets worse when I break stuff in anger, then it, well crap, now this has to be replaced out of my pocket before someone else notices
<Canadian_Brony> I should get back to filling out this application . . .
<Buytoast> anthor is dangerous territory
<Buytoast> anthro*
<DashWithRainbows> Meh, like I care.
<Canadian_Brony> Anthropology?
<Athgaar> anatomy's the killer
<Petrified_Discord> Canadian_Brony: Suddenly it has a whole new meaning XD
<Athgaar> anyone who gets that reference
<Dken2021> Ponies47 ah, starting off as freshman?
<Buytoast> might as well call yourself a furry and fetch a comfy fursuit if you get off to anthro
<Ponies47> Dken2021: Yesh :S
<otakon> okay guys I'm off to bed
<Athgaar> sleep weell
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Night otakon :)
<Canadian_Brony> g'night otakon
<otakon> see you all later, SuperBrony64 thanks for the stream mate
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> otakon: dream of ponies
<twilight_sprinkle> the whole mlp furry thing is pretty much just the result of adult/teen male hormones+a show bronies think about a lot that has acartoon ponies, its not that surprising
<otakon> bye all
<twilight_sprinkle> bye otakon
<Dken2021> nighty otakon
<DashWithRainbows> Buytoast You do realize that dressing up in a fursuit is more in the furfag area, right?
<Buytoast> well yeah
<DashWithRainbows> I do enjoy looking at anthros though.
<Athgaar> no, twilight
<DashWithRainbows> So if that labels me as a furry, I don't care.
<twilight_sprinkle> im cool with trolls :P
<Athgaar> the problem is that the mlp fandom is internet-based
<Buytoast> suit yourself
<twilight_sprinkle> i like to troll sometimes too, im hip!
<otakon> there is nothing wrong with appreciating anthro characters in a clean context
<Canadian_Brony> "Anthropology" is a story on fimfiction.net about Lyra and her continuing research about the mythical being called a "human"
<Dovah> I will make my house mob proof if it kills me! repeadedly!
<otakon> lol so technically she's a "Humey" huh Canadian_Brony?
<otakon> okay with that I'm out, g'night!
<Canadian_Brony> wha . . .
<twilight_sprinkle> Athgaar: 4-chan based no less
<Canadian_Brony> g'night ota
<Canadian_Brony> dammit
<Spitfire> im going to bed
<Athgaar> who's streaming and punching rock
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Spitfire
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Night Spitfire :)
<Cypresswolf> I've read the first 2 chapters of Anthology, good fanfic
<Buytoast> making fun of your voice would be too easy
<Canadian_Brony> Athgaar SB64
<twilight_sprinkle> Athgaar: superbrony is
<Derpy_Hooves> i am going to bed as well
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Spitfire
<Petrified_Discord> We should install beds in the chat so people don't have to leave.
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Derpy_Hooves
<Cypresswolf> Anthropology...whatever its called
<Dovah> night Derpy_Hooves
<Buytoast> not to mention i don't even know who you are
<Dovah> minecraft question!: can i make smelting go faster?
<Cypresswolf> Canadian_Brony: Have you read A Ghost Story?
<Athgaar> no
<Canadian_Brony> Cypresswolf yeah, it's a story. Rated everyone. IIRC, tags are "Comedy", "Adventure", and "Human"
<Athgaar> dovah: no
<Ponies47> Night Derpy|Asleep
<Canadian_Brony> Dovah no
<Canadian_Brony> g
<Canadian_Brony> dammit
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Derpy|Asleep
<Athgaar> the only way is to build multiple furnaces and split the workload
<Canadian_Brony> Cypresswolf never heard of it.
*Ponies47 Still hasen't played Minecraft yet ;_;
<Dovah> Canadian_Brony: fuck... 200 iron ore going to take long time....
<Athgaar> what does +v do
<Canadian_Brony> Dovah make lots of furnaces and split the workload.

<Dovah> Canadian_Brony: i can do that? cool thanks
<Athgaar> it's not
<Canadian_Brony> twilight_sprinkle no.
<twilight_sprinkle> good
<twilight_sprinkle> derpy is not the mother-type
<Dken2021> twilight_sprinkle pretty much 95% of speculations is fan made
<Canadian_Brony> Dovah eeyup. I have an entire room in one house dedicated to smelting.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dken2021: thats good
<Buytoast> damn near everything in the poyfag fandom is fanon
<Athgaar> of speculations? 100% by definition
<Buytoast> why do you think veryone bitched everywhere when the luna episode came out
<Cypresswolf> Canadian_Brony: Its a human in Equestria story - person dies, and finds a gateway to equestria in the afterlife but realizes he cant interact with Equestria's denizens - 18 chapters now http://www.fimfiction.net/story/23419/A-Ghost-Story
<Athgaar> unless you count the ones thrown into the story
<Dovah> Canadian_Brony: lol this is my first house on survival so it isnt all that great yet :P
<Ponies47> My mind is still bucked up from listening to that reading of "Cheerilee's Garden" O~O
<Cypresswolf> Very good story
<Ponies47> NEVER read that story
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: the rage at vinyls eye color was also funny
<Ponies47> NEVER
<Slenderman> Minecraft, eh?
<Canadian_Brony> Cypresswolf that's a cursed blessing, eh?
<Cypresswolf> yep
<Buytoast> people will always bitch about something if it doesn't fit in with their special hug boxing precious fandom
<Canadian_Brony> Cypresswolf . . . wait, yeah. I've heard that somewhere before.
<Slenderman> Where is this guy?
<Canadian_Brony> hi Slenderman. In his mine.

<Petrified_Discord> Cypresswolf: Oh yeah, I read that. Didn't quite care for the snarky, superpowered protagonist, but it was pretty funny.

<Dken2021> card collection?
<Dovah> yeah i could use some cacti.
<Phase4> 00,02reboot time
<Dken2021> this map could use more sand
<Athgaar> all they're good for is decoration and green dyes
<Petrified_Discord> Rare Rarity card. Huh. :/
<Cypresswolf> well...Bear Grylls would eat it for sustenence for sure....*sigh* this will certainly be an experience *goes to try it* probably going to regret this....

<Petrified_Discord> My favorite is ü (umlaut) because the only way to make the "oo" sound in English is with...well, "oo".
<Athgaar> if prone to memory leaks

<Petrified_Discord> Dumorimasoddaa: Which language is that from?
<Athgaar> are we allowed to post links
<Dumorimasoddaa> Though in english the umlaut means don't merge these vowle sounds
<Ponies47> Guess who voice's Iron Will in that video? XD
<Athgaar> brian blessed
<cachi01|mobile> YAPLAP

<Ponies47> *voiced
<cachi01|mobile> Yeah i saw that animation in the morning at equestria.net
<cachi01|mobile> Equestrianet*
<Dumorimasoddaa> Naïve is one of the few common English words to use the umlaut
<Athgaar> that's because it's not an English word at all
<cachi01|mobile> Equestrianet.org
<Dumorimasoddaa> Athgaar yes it is it's in the English dictionary
<Flootahshy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87oeJOteWIg&feature=related
<Athgaar> it's a loanword though
<Petrified_Discord> EquestriaSkynet
<Dumorimasoddaa> So is every other word in English.
<Athgaar> depending on how loose you want to get with the definition, yeah
<trollghost> HI GUYS!

<Petrified_Discord> POW http://grammarist.com/spelling/gray-grey/
<Dumorimasoddaa> trollghost yep French lone word that kept gender
<Dumorimasoddaa> We have a few very obscure other words
<trollghost> hey, HEY, you speak our language mofos, you speak OUR language, english, your gonna do it right
<trollghost> so you say colour
<Dumorimasoddaa> But they tend to be Latin lones
<Ponies47> So Rina-Cahn is going to be at Canterlot Gardens... EPIC! :D
<Athgaar> nah
<sub06905> and favourite?
<Athgaar> we took a lot of stuff from French

*trollghost kills self out of irony
<Athgaar> that's not how irony works
<DerpDash> Knock Knock!
<trollghost> go away.
<Petrified_Discord> Athgaar: What if he kills himself with a bar of iron?
<trollghost> or a clothes iron
<trollghost> or iron ore
<Athgaar> that's not "out of irony"
<trollghost> or an iron ingot
<Dumorimasoddaa> Athgaar it's ironic to misspell something after just hammering on about how you spell things
<trollghost> its "out of ironing"
<Athgaar> not quite
<thelonepony> iron bucket?
<cachi01|mobile> Buck it
<Petrified_Discord> Aha

<Dumorimasoddaa> trollghost you don't use "out of" in that sence
<Dumorimasoddaa> It would be by
<trollghost> Dumorimasoddaa I do
<Dumorimasoddaa> Well you are wrong.
<trollghost> also it was a play on words, not an actual sentence.
<trollghost> [/thread]
<Athgaar> that was odd
<Petrified_Discord> Dumorimasoddaa: Dafuq is a "sence"? :P
<cachi01|mobile> Guess what......

<Pearly> hey there, how are you?
<thelonepony> hai Pearly and MASF123
<tSpx|Reading> I dl'd this yesterday and gave it a whirl; I could never get my rocket to angle properly, always went straight up unless I tried to adjust it, which always ended up with me over-torquing and losing all stability
<Phase4> 00,02tSpx|Reading, use adv sas
<tSpx|Reading> Now, I got 6,000km up going straight up, but it was still a pain
<tSpx|Reading> Phase4: I did.
<AdamTheDuck> Oh just fine thanks Pearly :)
<Pearly> :D
<Sumica> 00,10you ran in to your couplers
<tSpx|Reading> Phase4: When I try to adjust pitch/yaw with SAS on, it won't let me change course from straight up, and the moment I take it off I just start tumbling
<Pearly> My name is Pearly Pie, :D
<Phase4> 00,02woahj

<Pearly> the monotype looks weird but looks oh sooo puerty on my end
<Pearly> it looks rather ugly if it were gold
<Phase4> 00,02font was the default
<Phase4> 00,02black backgound i had to set
<Phase4> 00,02the default grey is ugly
<Phase4> 00,02Macvey kerman, i'm feeling good about this, are you?
<Phase4> 00,02he looks like he's been labotimized
<Pearly> I am on mac, using xchat aqua... black bg white font coloir

<tSpx|Reading> alexxm I'm often trolling 1 or 2 other chans, and it's easiest for me to do that in a 3rd party client.
*AdamTheDuck hands out the marshmallows as we roast them over the repeatingly exploding rockets.
<Phase4> 00,02every now and again i get worried that i might have too much rocket
<Phase4> 00,02fortunately this subsides quickly
<tSpx|Reading> Phase4 Lawl.

<Phase4> 00,02i'ma add a cheat rocket
<tSpx|Reading> Phase4: your game, you have fun how you want
<AdamTheDuck> If cheat rocket = more explosivo, then it's fine by me
<RD_is_awesome> I gave a booster 10,000 thrust once, it blew through my rocket and killed all the kerbals
<Dark_Horst> they will die
<Phase4> 00,02RD_is_awesome, i have legit rockets that crush themselves when i throttle up
<Phase4> 00,02its very anoying
<Phase4> 00,02stupid stage seperators

<Spike_> Do i need to install anything to watch the stream or am i just doing it wrong? :S
<MASF123|> I know that...but still.
<MASF123|> The other VA didn't give a shit or something.
<MASF123|> Then again it is Tara's thing she stole from a song. So...
<Phase4> 00,02surprise game start
<Gold_Demona> It's just that Tara's the only one who really dove into the fandom and claimed them as her slaves. =P
<AdamTheDuck> Spike_: You shouldn't need to install anything, it requires flash I think but I'm not a major computer expert :P
<AdamTheDuck> "Every week I get trolled by Tara Strong" :D Love that line in the Brony Song.
<Spike_> Alright thanks. I might check if i have the newest flash :D
<MASF123|> Sometimes I wonder...about goin down under.

<Kothen> You mean run up and tap it on the shoulder?
<AdamTheDuck> They don't need some crummy morphein or defib
<AdamTheDuck> Real men just shout at downed soldiers and tap them and they instantly man the fuck up!
<MASF123|> I like the morphein in Kane and Lynch
<SirGanjalf> What game is this?
<MASF123|> I always find it funny they stick the needle in my ass.
<AdamTheDuck> SirGanjalf: Guns of Icarus
<SirGanjalf> thanks, AdamTheDuck

<AdamTheDuck> XAX: But in Gears of War, soldiers don't even need shock paddles or any fancy medical equipment. :3
<XAX> Sumica: Pardon?
<XAX> AdamTheDuck: lol.
<Chrysalis> Sumica oh?
<MASF123|> AdamTheDuck, they die like real men do.

<XAX> LOL.
<AdamTheDuck> XAX: They simply yell at downed soldiers to get the fuck back into battle, like real men :D
<Sumica> 00,10and a piro that spent all his time bitching about no one geting money as he stood in the back with a flare gun
<Sumica> 00,10on a piro wave
<XAX> wut.
<MASF123|> Do that twice in Gears and they still die.
<MASF123|> LOL
<XAX> AdamTheDuck: "I DONT CARE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR BODY HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH LEAD. GET BACK IN THERE SOLDIER."

<Phase4> 00,02ai captins would suck
<Phase4> 00,02what they need is more players
<Chrysalis> yeah, but at least we could play with the current low player count
<Chrysalis> playing with poor AI is better than sitting waiting

<VioletLynnScraton> ok
<AdamTheDuck> I'm like the answer man :3
<VioletLynnScraton> AdamTheDuck: true.
*Gold_Demona gives AdamTheDuck a hat that says "answer guy" on it.
<MASF123> FUUUU- :{
<sammiver> AdamTheDuck answer man is best pony
<MASF123> ;[
<MASF123> :[
<AdamTheDuck> Yay another hat to add to the collection :3

<MASF123> Fuck my life.
<sammiver> +Phase4 is best streamer
<VioletLynnScraton> MASF123: no thank you :3
<sammiver> what is the point of this game?
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Have you tried ebay?
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona: Yeah but they're all really cheap quality
<Gold_Demona> ah
<VioletLynnScraton> If i were to call Phase4 on skype, he'd probably deny it.
<VioletLynnScraton> :L
<MASF123> I got killed by I Ilovefatasses22
<VioletLynnScraton> if only Mane 6 MLP: Fighting is Magic was multiplayer....
<VioletLynnScraton> I would K.O. everyone with mah trusty Applejack. :D
<Lil_B> VioletLynnScraton ... it is, they already showed on Stage VS matches
<MASF123> yeah it should be an indie game for xbox
<VioletLynnScraton> MASF123: Yes. I shall send that to Microsoft.
<MASF123> You realy should
<VioletLynnScraton> I might if i can get their phone #
<Gold_Demona> But... it's a fan game...
<MASF123> use their contacts on xbox.com
<VioletLynnScraton> Alright, i will l83r
<MASF123> so what they can profit if they buy the license
<VioletLynnScraton> .....?
<Gold_Demona> That's like selling a fanfiction, isn't it?
<MASF123> and bronies will buy it regardless so why not they will get more money back.
<MASF123> You can sell fanfiction if you want to.
<Gold_Demona> No you can't
<Buytoast> are you bloody insane?
<Gold_Demona> Not without getting sued
<MASF123> This is a land of opportunity...Merica.
<Buytoast> even MURIKA would sue your ass to the ground for that
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, but there's a thing called copyright law?
<MASF123> That's why you buy the license like I said.
<Gold_Demona> You can't sell something that's made with somebody else's property.
<MASF123> Read my posts plz
<Gold_Demona> Like it's that easy to buy a license
<MASF123> it is
<VioletLynnScraton> I'll be right back.
<MASF123> ok
<MASF123> fuuuuuu-
<MASF123> Goddamn it son of a bitch!
<Saturn> 08,01so not many people know this
<Saturn> 08,01but i have... i dunno, a fear, an extreme distaste, of bins
<MASF123> Like waste bins?
<Saturn> 08,01yes
<Gold_Demona> O_o
<Saturn> 08,01the thought of touching one fills me with abject terror
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<MASF123> ...germaphobe?
<Saturn> 08,01my mother has no such qualms, and i was arguing with her over whether the bacon was, in fact, ham
<Saturn> 08,01so she opened the bin, and dug through it to find the packet
<Saturn> 08,01i nearly screamed
<Saturn> 08,01i freaked the fuck out
<MASF123> what was in the packet?
<Saturn> 08,01i demanded she wash her hands 3 times
<Gold_Demona> Oh, you mean touching the CONTENTS of the bin
<Saturn> 08,01Gold_Demona: contents or actual bin
<Saturn> 08,01anything to do with bins
<Gold_Demona> Oh... hm
<MASF123> Recycle bins on the computer scare him too.
<Saturn> 08,01she was refusing to wash them the third time, and i nearly broke down in tears; that's how upsetting it was to me
<Saturn> 08,01my brain is weird sometimes
<MASF123> ...that's kind of sad. I guess.
<Gold_Demona> I can understand not wanting to touch the stuff in the trashcan. That stuff's gross.
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Saturn
<MASF123> ohai Mark!
<VioletLynnScraton> ohai
<Saturn> 08,01Gold_Demona: well, yeah, but it's not just like "eew, gross", it actually freaks me the fuck out
<Saturn> 08,01i told this to my best friend in edinburgh; when i made bad puns or horrific jokes, she'd chase me around her flat with a broom she'd dipped in the bin
<Gold_Demona> I can't say that's the weirdest phobia I've ever heard, but it's right up there.
<MASF123> i have many fears...some I don't even remember what they are.
<Sumica> 00,10what's wrong with the bin folder, most my steam stuff is in there.
<VioletLynnScraton> who is streaming still?
<AdamTheDuck> That is cruel of her sammiver :/
<AdamTheDuck> oops wrong tab again :D
<AdamTheDuck> That is cruel of her Saturn * There we go.
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: well, she knew not to actually touch me with it, or corner me; it was all in good fun
<Gold_Demona> I have an irrational fear of personally interacting with people I don't know.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm sort of like that about plants too
<AdamTheDuck> Ah, the way you made it out it sounded like she was being mean :3
<Saturn> 08,01but not to the same level
<VioletLynnScraton> i have a fear of slender
<VioletLynnScraton> ;__;
<MASF123> plants aren't much of a threat to humans. Some can be poisenous
<Gold_Demona> It's really stupid, cuz I have a hard time even making phone calls to get important things done.
<Saturn> 08,01MASF123: i just find them tres creepy
<Lil_B> I have a phobie of some kinds of raugh surfaces, like Cartboard Boxes
<MASF123> They ok
<Lil_B> I can't touch them without my hair thanding streight up
<MASF123> Saturn do you suffer from any past truamas?
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: Bet you hate sandpaper then. =P
<Saturn> 08,01MASF123: i don't think so. the only fear i have that i can ascribe to a past trauma is my fear of lifts
<Saturn> 08,01i don't have many fears, but the ones i do have are rather strane
<sammiver> is it still +phase4 streaming this?
<Saturn> 08,01*strange
<AdamTheDuck> sammiver: Eeyup
<LadyFluxum> Hi all
<AdamTheDuck> Hello LadyFluxum
<LadyFluxum> What game is this?
<Lil_B> Sandpaper is fine actually, I don't know what it is -.- Cardboard Boxes and erm... whats the english word
<MASF123> could be something you can't remember
<Saturn> 08,01basically, when i was 5, i was trapped in a lift in india. all the walls, the ceiling, and the floor of the lift were mirrors. i was trapped in The Box of Truth for about 5 minutes, but it felt like hours. From then on, I've not been able to travel in lifts (except glass ones)
<Lil_B> a type of really cheap wall...
<Gold_Demona> Oh, like drywall?
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: plasterboard?
<sammiver> i love the sound it makes every time someone sends a messege to you on bronystate :)
<Gold_Demona> I getcha, Lil_B. It's that particular texture
<MASF123> elevators and escalators...how are they for you, Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01sammiver: <3
<Lil_B> Saturn exactly
<Saturn> 08,01MASF123: escalators are fine; lift is the british word for elevator
<LadyFluxum> sammiver: How ya doing, bro?
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona yeah, it's really just some strange ones
<sammiver> @saturn <3 <3 <3
<MASF123> oh...
<Lil_B> Saturn how about a Patanostra?
<MASF123> ok. so lift you ment elevator?
<sammiver> ladyfluxum im doing fine, bro
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: i'm absolutely fine in those
<LadyFluxum> sammiver: Massive torrents and thunderstorm here atm :/

*Gold_Demona hugs MadSurge
<LadyFluxum> Hi MadSurge

*Saturn 08,01hugs MadSurge
<LadyFluxum> sammiver: I'm swedish aswell
<AdamTheDuck> Hello MadSurge
<MadSurge> We're discussing fears? I was terrified of lizards when I was little :D
<AdamTheDuck> and LadyFluxum this is Guns of Icarus
<Saturn> 08,01MASF123: i think i'm just afraid of germs in general, but it doesn't really affect me apart from the bins thing
<AdamTheDuck> Was afk :3
<MASF123> Saturn your a germaphobe
<MASF123> it's normal.
<Saturn> 08,01MASF123: *you're
<LadyFluxum> Fears? Well, that would be jellyfish
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Grammar Nazi Saturn . :P
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: it's not being a grammar nazi, it's being an educator.
<creeperhugger10> hello
<sammiver> ladyfluxum :O awsome atleast in stockholm the weather is great but im not sure because i cant look out of my window
<LadyFluxum> They are not animals, they grow line plants but they are not plants either and then they float around like animals but they are not animals..... wtf
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn: Oh lighten up, it's fun being a Grammar Nazi and you know it. :P
<Saturn> 08,01sammiver: the weather in scotland is great too
<MASF123> Saturn is my new teacher.
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: i'm light as a feather.
<Lil_B> well, I have fears of Hights too XD If I'm more than 23 steps on a ledder or bending over a railing without having my hands on something to hold me I'm close to becoming uncouncous
<Lil_B> 2 Steps*
<LadyFluxum> And some are even immortal (capable of selfregenerate cells and reprocude themselves withexact copies)
<LadyFluxum> Screw jellyfish
<MASF123> I remember Monk suffers from many phopia and fears. It's a funny show though.
<VioletLynnScraton> I'm now scared of twilight.
<MASF123> phobia
<AdamTheDuck> MASF123: Ah Monk, is that the show that runs for about 2 minutes about a raging white dog?
<sammiver> @saturn that is good :$ is the weather there usually good ?
<MASF123> noooo......
<Gold_Demona> MASF123: Monk also has OCD, so that doesn't help any of his fears any. :P
<AdamTheDuck> MASF123: Damn... :P
<MASF123> Monk is a great detective.
<Lil_B> Jellyfish used to be normal fish, but when the other fishes saw them they laughed at them and said "You Jelly?" because they couldn't swim
<Saturn> 08,01LadyFluxum: actually, they *are* animals
<Saturn> 08,01(according to wikipedia :P)
<LadyFluxum> Oh
<LadyFluxum> Still freak me out
<Chrysalis> wohai Saturn
<MASF123> wikipedia
*Chrysalis gives out hugs
<Gold_Demona> They're just one of the animals that fall under "really freaking weird".
<LadyFluxum> But their cullular makeup is more of a hybrid of plant and animal
*Lil_B hugs Chrysalis back
<Saturn> 08,01LadyFluxum: it blew my mind when i foudn out that virii are not actually alive
<Lil_B> some Jellyfish even have developed some early stages of Eyes
<LadyFluxum> Oh god....
<MASF123> yes god
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: Like Tentacruel?
<VioletLynnScraton> who dumped a gallon of mountain dew into the ocean?!
<sammiver> WOW i just took off my headphones and its a thunder storm outside and i thought the weather was great :'(
<LadyFluxum> sammiver: told ya
<Gold_Demona> Lil_B: Or maybe a metroid?
<LadyFluxum> Gold_Demona: Nah, metroids doesn't develop eyes untill the gamma stage
<Gold_Demona> LadyFluxum: Oh yeah, I forgot. :P
<sammiver> i still dont see the point with this game
<Gold_Demona> Maybe jellyfish are getting into the gamma stage. :O
<MASF123> Saturn any other fears?
<LadyFluxum> Gold_Demona: at zeta stage tey got 8 eyes ^^
<Aryd> I think it looks fun
<VioletLynnScraton> Who dumped Mountain Dew into the ocean?!
<MadSurge> Saturn: just rogue strings of RNA or something, they're the zombies of real life!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Does that mean they're gonna eat our brains?
<Kandarihu> sammiver, you're part of the crew of an airship teaming up with the crew of another airship against two other airships.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: no, but they'll gladly eat our cells
<VioletLynnScraton> Who wants.... a kinda creepy music video countaining ponies>

<Fisheh_Fish> So, how much fun did I miss during the GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0 show last night?
<meeps> Oblivion! you sicken me.....
<MaxTheBrony> sammiver where in stockholm?
<Nyst> Ahh Oblivion. I once spent four days trying to get all the mods to work before I gave up.
<sammiver> in a place called Enskede
<flutter_spin> Fisheh_Fish: soso. Mostly talked about favorite games, GamesRadar top 100 games, MMOs, and their fundraiser for them to go to Bronycon Fan Fair

<StinkomanFan> THE FUCK IS THAT?
<Kandarihu> Some sorta cannon?
<Nyst> It's evil.
<Gold_Demona> These are the voyages of the-- no wait...

<flutter_spin> I tried Oblivion for 5 hours, but couldn't get much into it. (I was borrowing it)
<sammiver> Slender = most overrated game ever
<Nyst> Phase4: no mods?
<killerpony7733> Phase4 You can get 100 immunity to disease if you get a ring that increases that
<MadSurge> sammiver: Slender is a "cat jumping on a piano" simulator :D
<killerpony7733> Phase4 Meaning you got no way to get poisoned or diseased
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, no mods
<VioletLynnScraton> OH MAH GAWD JUST PLAI SLENDER
<Phase4> 00,02VioletLynnScraton, NO :<
<Nyst> Wow...that should be something then.

<MadSurge> Phase4: thank you :D
<Phase4> 00,02killerpony7733, breathing underwater?
<Nyst> Iirc Argonians make good rogues and mages.
<sammiver> but argonian looks ugly as buck!
<Gold_Demona> Man, seriously. What's so great about Slender?
<killerpony7733> Phase4 Oh that too. that's even one of the better traits
<VioletLynnScraton> Its scar and i love it
<Phase4> 00,02sammiver, ikr
<VioletLynnScraton> scary*\
<Dark_Horst> sammiver: everyone is this game looks ugly as fuck

<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
*Bronysith glomps Phase4
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it's great for scarecam LPs, ergo shitty LPs :D

<Jmo> 'ello Golakka
<VioletLynnScraton> well, whatever.
<VioletLynnScraton> im out
<Phase4> 00,02so starting oblivion might not be a good idea
<flutter_spin> You know - I have KOTOR, Fallout 3, and Oblivion --- yet I haven't played any of the three
<MadSurge> Hey Golakka! :)
<VioletLynnScraton> byeeee
<AdamTheDuck> Bye VioletLynnScraton
<sammiver> +phase4 i hope you are gonna play in first person because i cant stand that face :D
<Phase4> 00,02flutter_spin, i played fallout 3 untill it started crashing too much to continue
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: isnt it about 9 am for you?
<Phase4> 00,02so bout an hour
<Jmo> 11PM
<Gold_Demona> flutter_spin: I have the same problem with Skyrim and the four Assassin's Creed games
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, 23:00
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: informative/humorous LPs are still the best
<Nyst> sammiver: you only see the back of the head though.
<Phase4> 00,0211 PM
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: True dat
<flutter_spin> lol. Ditto Phase4 . After the 5th crash/bug I gave up. Barely got out of the first place.
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: where are yu?
<killerpony7733> Nyst Umm tbh i wen't away from what it asks to you try out and wen't with the main traits going for repair weapons heavy heavy armor or light armor idunno. I just remember going for weapon skill and several other related things
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, australia
<golakka> Odd, My lightIRC flash isnt working :(
<Dark_Horst> oh boy
<Phase4> 00,02we got many magicka players in here?
<AdamTheDuck> Let our journey to meet the 7 voice actors begin!
<sammiver> nyst but the back of the head is ugly too
<Jmo> poor widdle golakka
<golakka> I play it sometimes Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02golakka, :(
<killerpony7733> Nyst Repair or smithing as a major skill is very very useful
<sammiver> name your
<Phase4> 00,02if we get three magicka players we can play that
<sammiver> oops
<Kandarihu> Alright
<golakka> Count me in Phase4
<golakka> Ive not hit people with ARSE mines in ages :D
<Nyst> killerpony7733: See I thought stealth or lockpicking were better. But then I like playing as a sneaky character.
<flutter_spin> Magicka? Now why does that sound familiar
<Rex_Mundi> Repair will allow you to build Weapon Repair kits... wait...
<sammiver> +phase4 name your character Willie wonka!
<Nyst> Magicka is a friend killing simulator.
<killerpony7733> Nyst Oh sure lockpicking as a major skill is a big yes
<Bronysith> morrowind>oblivion
<killerpony7733> So that should be one of the major skills
<Bronysith> oblivion however is an amazing game
<sammiver> +phase4 or John de lancie
<Phase4> 00,02how does one close oblivion
<golakka> Alt F4
<Phase4> 00,02there we go
<AdamTheDuck> Alt F4 doesn't work for oblivion
<Phase4> 00,02golakka, didnt work
<golakka> Ctrl Q
<AdamTheDuck> You need a mod to use alt F4
<Alchemist> how could someone make the most useless character? pick athletics, acrobatics, illusion as major skills?
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, wat
<Rex_Mundi> yo ho
<flutter_spin> wut?
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4: That's the Bethesda you know and love.

<golakka> FOR CHRIST SAKE
<Phase4> 00,02flutter_spin, watch
<golakka> its being soo tempramental today
<Kandarihu> flutter_spin, um, I don't know. Diablo perhaps?
<Phase4> 00,02golakka, verify integrity?
<flutter_spin> but my fanfic! lol. Fine. I'll stick around some more.
<golakka> And its crashed!
<fluttermac> lets talk mlp
<Phase4> 00,02golakka, verify the integrity, we;ll try let you join at the next checkpoint
<golakka> kk
<killerpony7733> fluttermac That would get boring quick in most cases. We generally talk about things we like etc and what now
<sammiver> fluttermac: pinkie pie is best pony
<killerpony7733> But suit yourself
<MadSurge> ALL DEM GAMES SHOUT OUTS :D
<fluttermac> i like fluttershy
<Gold_Demona> sammiver: I agree
<oni_link> MadSurge: IKR
<golakka> steam is such a useless program
<Cypresswolf> :| Vista's being a jerk - wont load up ES:Oblivion...or much of anything else for that matter
<sammiver> your punishment must be more severe +phase4
<AdamTheDuck> fluttermac: /) *yay*
<MadSurge> fluttermac: me too! What about your least favorite pony?
<flutter_spin> I hate to say this. Rainbow Dash is my least favorite.
<oni_link> :(
<Gold_Demona> fluttermac: fluttershy and rarity keep fighting for the "second favorite" on my list. :3
<golakka> 200 hours to validate magica
<fluttermac> hmmm uh i dont like pinkie
<Cypresswolf> Argh! I gotta restart..*grumbles*
<Gold_Demona> Well, if we're only talking about the mane six, Twilight's my least favorite.
<MadSurge> flutter_spin: me too actually
<golakka> Ok, Im just running the IRC now, no stream
<golakka> hopefully it will be faster
<oni_link> I like each of the mane six, all for different reasons
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: 5th favorite
<Saturn> 08,01i just bought the dark grey hoodie version of this: http://www.redbubble.com/people/pixel-pie-pro/works/7830340-i-can-count-to-muffin-mlp-fim
<flutter_spin> Fluttershy, Twilight, and Pinkie Pie match my personality. Rarity is unique, but more complex (which makes her interesting). Applejack intimidates me, but she can handle herself. I just don't like competition, which is why Rainbow Dash is there.
<fluttermac> my little sis is BUGGING ME
<Vivix> I just saw the antagonist poster, and laughed so hard at Silverspoon and Diamond Tiara
<Chrysalis> Saturn awesome
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Rainbowdash is 5th on my list
<oni_link> awesome Saturn
<Vivix> "Det va nu danskt"?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Pinkie is your fav, right?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yesh
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: /)
<fluttermac> I <3 LUNA
<Bronysith> Saturn: very cute
<Gold_Demona> She used to be sixth favorite, but she bounced her way up as the series progressed. =P
<Vivix> Pinkie went from bottom to near top to me aswell
<flutter_spin> No. Fluttershy is my favorite. Twilight is best. Pinkie Pie is just fun lovin'
<Vivix> but, I love the bottom pony too
<Gold_Demona> (\ MadSurge
<sammiver> is anyone here a clopper?
<cowvarkian> <.<
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: similar with Rarity, she was least favorite but now she's 4th :D
<fluttermac> i miss derpy
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Me too. I love all of the mane 6. I just love some more than others
<Vivix> yeah
<MadSurge> sammiver: we don't need to know that thanks :D
<cowvarkian> what're we watching
<Chrysalis> chat is PG rated, keep it that way
<flutter_spin> "Magicka"
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Rarity started out in the middle for me, now she fights with Fluttershy for the Number 2 slot. =P
*Jmo glomps Vivix tightly
*Vivix bites Jmo's ear
<Jmo> Daaaaaaaaat Vivix.
<Vivix> Hiiii
<Vivix> I think my top three is Fluttershy Rarity and Pinkie
<cowvarkian> are they speaking a twist of civilation language and simese?
<flutter_spin> Actually, I'm incredibly shy when meeting up with people.
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Me too, but it's Pinkie first.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: realized I love her drama queen routines :D
<cowvarkian> *cilization
<sammiver> it looks like noone here is a clopper.........good
<Chrysalis> hah
<Chrysalis> http://www.redbubble.com/people/scrittah/works/7620933-stealthy-pink-e-pi-shirt
<MASF123> Well atleast Pinkie is on that list.
<Chrysalis> this ones quite clever
<AdamTheDuck> Well time for me to hit the hay, night everyone. :)
*cowvarkian got up 5 minutes ago
<Vivix> sammiver: there might be, but we're not allowed to talk about it
<Vivix> pro or con, don't talk about it
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Rarity won me over completely with her whining scene.
<Vivix> The whining scene was one of the first things I saw on youtube, that made me just--have to see the show
<fluttermac> im in canada
<Gold_Demona> Chrysalis: I want that shirt. :O
<cowvarkian> dat kandarihu
<flutter_spin> lol
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I was giggling so much at the "AHM SO PATHEHEHEHETEEC" scene :D
<Vivix> hehe
<cowvarkian> I still don't know what we're watching
<Vivix> Rarity is adoreable
<golakka> ok Phase4, magica validated, gonna try again
<flutter_spin> whoa
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yes, I loved that scene. XD
<fluttermac> iam wathcing this day aria literil
<Phase4> 00,02K
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: "Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me! I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in!!!"
<flutter_spin> It is like Diablo
<Chrysalis> this needs to be a t-shirt http://ih1.redbubble.net/image.12149818.6899/pp,375x360.jpg
<Dark_Horst> whats he playing an why is purple tentacle in it?
<flutter_spin> "Magicka"
<flutter_spin> I guess the tentacle outfit is a fun reference
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Oh Tabitha :D
<cowvarkian> so, I ask about three times, and Dark_Horst asks once...
<cowvarkian> bah whatever
<Vivix> haha
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: She's brilliant
<Vivix> Wow
<Vivix> cowvarkian: they're playing Magicka
<cowvarkian> I know
<cowvarkian> I heard
<MadSurge> DED
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: they tend t sleep at times
<flutter_spin> cowvarkian: I've been answering the question too many times. I've been trying to get back to my fic
<cowvarkian> <.< why are guns in magicka
<Gold_Demona> They're magic guns! :D
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, Vietnam
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: the best kind of guns
<cowvarkian> obviously
<cowvarkian> So, I've had three hours of sleep today, and I'm going back to school tommorow
<flutter_spin> wow. There are a LOT put into this game
<Vivix> It's also one of the buggiest games I've ever played
<cowvarkian> Banana?
<flutter_spin> LOL
<flutter_spin> I didn't think they would put it in the pause screen. I thought the guy was kidding
<Chrysalis> Saturn should i get http://ih0.redbubble.net/image.11689703.1906/fig,black,mens,ffffff.jpg or http://ih2.redbubble.net/image.11677277.3756/fig,navy,mens,ffffff.jpg
<Gold_Demona> Ouch
<flutter_spin> I like the subtle Luna one. The jagged is cool, but reminds me too much of Nightmare Moon
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: the second one
<Chrysalis> hmm 2-0 to the more subtle one
<cowvarkian> whats with the teletubby
<Gold_Demona> Made it! Yay~
<flutter_spin> lol. Is there a way to turn off friendly fire?
<Vivix> noo
<cowvarkian> why would you want to
<Vivix> it makes the game extra hard
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: the latter would suit you better
<flutter_spin> aw ok. and more fun?
<Vivix> yeaa
<Chrysalis> 3-0
<cowvarkian> and then they instantly die
<Vivix> like that,hehehe
<Chrysalis> yeah im getting that one
<flutter_spin> LOL
<MadSurge> KA-BEEEWWWWWWM
<Vivix> wooow
<andy> lol
<Bronysith> Saturn: which one of those shirts would suit me?
<cowvarkian> yes
<Phase4> 00,02so

<Vivix> Aww, I almost only catch the end of your streams Phase
<Vivix> damn timezones
<flutter_spin> I woke up early today. I never do either.
<cowvarkian> I downloaded the MGS HDC on my 360...

<golakka> i just got magica working Phase4
<golakka> argh
<Phase4> 00,02XD
*Phase4 00,02hugs golakka
<cowvarkian> in the middle of the night
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: should i get final fantasy 8?
<Chrysalis> YES!
<cowvarkian> whilst watching hell on wheels
<Chrysalis> Bronysith a million times yes
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: i shall buy it later on the PSN
<Cypresswolf> Install screen just loaded an ad - download Oblivion on your mobile phone....O_o Really? I cant fight baddies on a 2 inch 2 bit screen :|
<cowvarkian> dat old ass ad
<Chrysalis> eww psn
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: is the story pretty good to 8?
<Chrysalis> Bronysith its one of the earlier FF's
<Gold_Demona> Personally I thought 8 was boring.
<Chrysalis> the story rivals or beats just about anything ever made
<Gold_Demona> Not NEARLY as boring as 12, but pretty boring.
<Vivix> I thouht you had 8?
<cowvarkian> Is it one of the 800 hour long ones?
<Chrysalis> cowvarkian not 800, but im a good 20hours in
<cowvarkian> Or am I thinking of some other game
<Chrysalis> and only on the 2nd of 4 disks
<cowvarkian> Is it one of the games that's 60% cutscene?
<Vivix> if 8 was the one I played, it didn't have that many cutscenes
<Chrysalis> nope
<cowvarkian> Ok
<Vivix> but- it wasn't my kinda game
<Chrysalis> but the cutscenes are georgious
<trollghost> is the stream on?
<cowvarkian> no
<trollghost> http://youtu.be/-6b6HYHcF0A
<Gold_Demona> As far as FF's, I liked 6, 7, 9, and 10 the most.
<Gold_Demona> In that order
<Gold_Demona> though 6 and 7 are interchangeable
<trollghost> Gold_Demona dont drop F bombs like that
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: noone likes 8 :D
<Vivix> which one was the 8? The one wiht the train?
<MaxTheBrony> back :)
<sammiver> the stream doesnt work for me....
<MaxTheBrony> its down
<Vivix> Welkommen
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: 8 was the one where the guy's sword was also a gun
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: which is BAD ASS
<Vivix> That might have been the one I was told to play-
<Vivix> one of the first cutscenes is eh a ballroom dance?
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I will not argue that. Gunblade is awesome
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: until lightingin in ff13 makes it lame
<Gold_Demona> Doesn't make up for boring story and characters though.
<cowvarkian> gunblade is ridicilous
<Vivix> hehe
<cowvarkian> *spelling
<Vivix> most ff weapons are ridiculous, but- you don't see them very often?
<cowvarkian> thats it
<MadSurge> Vivix: there is a train on 8, but you practically just fight a boss on it
<Gold_Demona> I like the ridiculous weapons in FF mostly because they're unique
<Gold_Demona> And only the characters in the game can wield them. XD
<Vivix> Hm, MadSurge it miight- be the one I played, I can't remember. Friend lent it to me on PS2 I think
<Gold_Demona> Like Sephiroth's katana. Seriously. That thing's ridiculously long.
<Bronysith> final fantasy 8 is the fastest selling final fantasy?
<Bronysith> WOW
<MadSurge> Vivix: if it was 3d then yes it was 8
<Bronysith> fuck it
<Vivix> yeah it was like odd 3D
<Bronysith> im buying this game for my colleciton
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: There are trains in several FF games. 8's primary mode of transportation was... a city.
<Cypresswolf> Computer keeps freezing up because Vista keeps rotating my windows around in different orders when it sole purpose should be intalling a game :|
<Vivix> What should I have played to get into the story?
<Gold_Demona> a flying city that was slow as molasses
<MadSurge> Vivix: the other with a train dungeon was 6, but that was 2D
<sammiver> the live stream doesnt work for me....
<Gold_Demona> 7 started with a train.
<Vivix> it might have just been a short train sequence-
<MadSurge> sammiver: there's no stream right now
<Vivix> it was not in the beginning--I think...
<Vivix> the beginnign was like in a --place and you went dancing
<Cypresswolf> :[ Window Roulette over here :|
*Vivix master of memory
<MaxTheBrony> Anyone playing on Desolation on Gw2 :P?
<Gold_Demona> In 8, I remember Selphie going nuts "I LOVE TRAINS!!!!"
<sammiver> MadSurge: what happened to the stream?
<Vivix> Gold_Demona: yees, I think I remember that
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: That was 8
<MaxTheBrony> Phase4|2 went away
<MadSurge> sammiver: Phase4 just stopped streaming
<Vivix> Okay, then I've played 8 and tiny tiny tiny bit of 6 when I was a kid
<Gold_Demona> As far as story, I think 6 and 7 had better-developed stories.
<MadSurge> sammiver: now to wait for the next mod up to streaming...
<Phase4|2> 00,02?
<Vivix> hn, cause yeah people seem to love FF, but I wasn't too fond of the battle system, and didn't get the story back then
<Vivix> but, retrying is fun
<MadSurge> sammiver: Now you can post youtube links btw
<sammiver> MadSurge: ok i went away from the computer for 10 minutes and when i came back it was like this
<sammiver> MadSurge: how do you post links?
<Gold_Demona> I remember ff8's battle system being annoying.
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: so tell me what makes ff8 so good?
<Cypresswolf> If it doesnt install right this time - Fallout - if that crashes - Minecraft - and if that crashes I might as well call it a day because I'll be too ticked off to bother any further
<Gold_Demona> Mostly because I sucked at doing those "timed trigger attack" things
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: then you wouldnt like legend of dragoon
<MadSurge> sammiver: just post it on the dialogue bar o__o
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: lots of that in the game, mostly combos in fact
<Vivix> Cypresswolf: ;__; crashing and annoying windows functions are the worst
<sammiver> ok
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Combos? Like the kind in Chrono Trigger/Cross?
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: no i mean timed button presses in turn based
<Gold_Demona> Ew
<sammiver> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5jKuYOotsA
<Cypresswolf> Vivix: there are worse things :) - like Vista refusing to be upgraded or changed to another OS - Vista is a torture device
<Vivix> Uah
<Vivix> I bought W7 after using Xp for years- skipped Vista because of friends reviews
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Yeah, that stuff's annoying. If you're gonna make button combo things, then make it a real-time adventure game thing, like Kingdom Hearts was.
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: but that was the appeal to legend of dragoon, along with an awesome story and characters
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: If the story and characters are good enough, I can usually overlook annoying gameplay
<Cypresswolf> I have window 7 - for about 2 years now - every attempt to install it has ended up with Vista stopping the entire installation because it found (or made up) an error :|
<Vivix> whaaaat-
<Vivix> That's terrible-
*Jmo tackles Vivix
<Jmo> No, that is.
<Vivix> I bought a new HDD when I bought W7, cause I broke my old one
<Saturn> 08,01heh, still getting posts about BUCK:
<Saturn> 08,01http://www.fobequestria.com/2012/08/mission-005-buck-debrief-part-1-photo.html
*Vivix cries abuse, shouts for help
<Cypresswolf> WTF kind of program cant install an upgrade made for it?
<Saturn> 08,01soem AMAZING photos there
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: well i didnt really give 8 a fair chance, because i did just finish 7 which is a hard act to follow in a game
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: For example Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance has awesome characters and story, but I HATE the battle system.
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: True.
<Vivix> Cypresswolf: you bought upgrade or full W7?
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, i gots ipv6 working :3
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I played 8 all the way to the final dungeon and couldn't finish it.
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: so ill give it a fair shot to it. cause i do love a GOOD jrpg
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: and most final fantasies are
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: 6 7 and 10 were good
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: The older ones anyway
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: not this bullshit 13 bullshit
<Bronysith> BULLSHIT FINAL FANTASY GAME
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: I didn't even bother with 13 cuz 12 was so horribly boring.
<Cypresswolf> Its Windows 7 home premium, same type as my Vista os -
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: i quit 13 in 30 minutes
<Phase4> 00,02"Some great cosplays on display at BUCK 2012. Here's one of TheLivingTombstone."
<Gold_Demona> I lost faith in their ability to tell a good story
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: not kidding
<Gold_Demona> They're graphics are gorgeous but that doesn't excuse crappy storytelling
<Vivix> Cypresswolf: okay, well if its the full and not vistaupgrade, you could backup what you want to save into USB disk, format the computer, and do a clean install. Shouuld-work. but if it doesn't- yeah
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: lets be honest now
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: most people are impressed by graphics to be the better game nowadays
<Bronysith> AKA FALSE GAMERS
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, next year i'ma try get to the uk and attend
<Cypresswolf> :) I've pretty much destroyed the outer casing to Rage Quitting - throwing the thing across the room just about everytime 7's installation was cancelled and restarted
<Bronysith> Saturn: if i win the lottery between now and next BUCK i will definetly come
<Jmo> Didn't know that you could lay golden eggs Phase4.
<Vivix> Cypresswolf: hehe, sounds like my old computer
<Phase4> 00,02o_O
<tSparx> Oy all, real quick: is there an official time BronyState goes by? GMT/UTC? Eastern?
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: My honest opinion. Graphics don't make the game, but they are nice to have.
<Cypresswolf> the discs are fine though :)
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: <3
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: yes, but not that important
<Bronysith> Saturn: no love for me?
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Just because a game is super pretty doesn't make it a good game
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: <3 too
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: nope, but most gamers nowadays whom are impressed by skyrim cause of the graphics are false gamers
<Vivix> That being said, retro isn't for everyone. I couldn't play Morrowind until I installed MGE Xe
<Cypresswolf> worst part -I cant take it back - too damaged :D
<Vivix> Hehe
<Gold_Demona> I wouldn't call them false gamers. They're just easily impressed
<Bronysith> I think one of my fav RPGs is the original Fallout
<Vivix> But honestly, a full format should work, but you might loose all your stuff if the backup goes wrong
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: false gamers
<Lil_B> wow, by that number of people on Bronystate who wanna go to Buck next year I need to bring along a big Cardboard with "Bronystate" written on it to find everyone :)
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: judgemental much?
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: easily impressed=false gamers
<Vivix> ;__;
<Jmo> :3
<Cypresswolf> I havent attempted to reinstall it for 7 months now - I know the end result all too well
<Chrysalis> Saturn dont i get <3?
<Chrysalis> :(
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: sorry, gaming is my passion since i was a little kid
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Hey hey hey. I'm easily impressed.
<Vivix> I don't believe false gamers exist, but- I know theres a flux of casual and mainstream gamers
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: you get so much <3 that it goes without saying
<Bronysith> CASUALS!!!!!!
<Vivix> and I don't mind
<Bronysith> Dan VS Casual gamers
<Vivix> more money for the companies is good for me
<Phase4> 00,02Lets settle this argument: Graphics are not everything, nor are they meeningless
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
<Bronysith> Phase4: ikr
<Cypresswolf> :) Oblivion is done installing - time to saciate my rage :)
<Gold_Demona> Phase4: Exactly
<Vivix> Cypresswolf: beat those mudcrabs!
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: i mostly play games for the graphic
<Saturn> 08,01s
<Bronysith> Saturn: you said you liked TES arena
<Jmo> Beat those Vivixs!
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Bronysith> i recognize Saturn as a gamer
<Saturn> 08,01heh
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, also i get a /56 prefix for some reason
<Saturn> 08,01that's ironic, because i don't like computer games, really
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: you get so much <3 that it goes without saying
*Vivix cries. "Jmo, you're so mean"
<Bronysith> Saturn: but you liked Arena. which is a very good game
<Saturn> 08,01whoops
<Gold_Demona> I usually don't judge a game by it's graphics, but it's definitely a bonus if a good game si also pretty.
<Saturn> 08,01i just find them kinda boring, mostly
<Jmo> I love you too Vivix.
<Vivix> <3
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: on IPv6?
<Vivix> Gold_Demona: that's how I tend to think
<sammiver> so +phase4 stopped streaming but he is still here?
<Vivix> Atm, my obsession is next gen physics
<Phase4> 00,02i get 2^72 static addresses + 2^64 dynamic for the ppp session
<Phase4> 00,02sammiver, yes
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, yes
<Vivix> Herbal Essence ad
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: generational physics?
<Bronysith> Saturn: well at least you dont say you are a gamer like most assholes nowadays
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: like particle physics?
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: i'm the antithesis of a gamer
<Vivix> Saturn: next generation physics engines for games- so- no, not really real life physics
<Bronysith> Saturn: such as the dumbasses who say "I love the elder scrolls series. skyrim is my favorite...whats morrowind?"
<Saturn> 08,01oh
<Lil_B> ... these Remix War Requirements are bullshit... why do I have to use Box.com or Minus.com as upload sites and not Mediafire?
<Saturn> 08,01i've coded physics simulations before
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate
<Phase4> 00,02ma prefix is 2001:44b8:4196:e800::
<Dumori> Fluid Dymanics intregs me and pisses me off at the same time
<Vivix> hehe
<Phase4> 00,02there are many like it, but this one is mine
<Lil_B> hi FillyFlam
<Vivix> I am in love with Soft body physics destruction, like that Cryengine 3 car demo video
<Dumori> X3
<Dumori> My true coding love
<Saturn> 08,01Dumori: i love fluid dynamics! especially because one can apply fluidic concepts to traffic!
<Gold_Demona> Hi FillyFlam
<Vivix> Traficc control simulation office, GO!
<Dumori> is the demo secen way fo magic insanely small programs via generating the rest of the program vis a seed...
<Vivix> yeah, I think all the traffic planners go by fluid simulation now
<Dumori> Saturn: EXACTLY
<Saturn> 08,01my favourite branch of physics is particle physics
<Dumori> It just annoys me cos some times it's "guess" work more than pure math
<Dumori> particle pysics is ok
<Saturn> 08,01but i also have a soft spot for macro electromagnetics
<Lil_B> erm... is someone here good with photoshop or another Programm to edit a picture?
<Saturn> 08,01which kinda ties in with particle physics in the sense of accelerator design
<Dumori> electromagnetisim is awesome
<Dumori> when I was 13 I built a guass gun
<Dumori> and I did all the math
<Saturn> 08,01Dumori is my new favourite princess
<Dumori> well most of the math
<Dumori> and maybe I was 14
<Dumori> but still
<Pearly> Good morning
<Phase4> 00,02you guys and your greater understanding of math than me
<Lil_B> all these nice childhoots ... All I got to do was go to the doctore, play PC and meet the (way too big) family :(
<Dumori> the guy who helped me with the math whent on to get a scolarship at cambrige after getting 100% on is A levels
<Vivix> Because the stream buffer is up, I'm marveling at Phase4's Firefox, safari and opera and IE icons
<Saturn> 08,01i built a tesla coil when i was 18 and did most of the math; but at this point i was studying physics as a degree, so it's not as impressive :P
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, chrome should be on there too
<Dumori> I love i
<Dumori> IDKY but i is fun
<Vivix> Hehehe, oh yes there it is
<Vivix> Testing stuff with them?
<Phase4> 00,02every now and again
<Saturn> 08,01Dumori: that's awesome
<Dumori> Saturn I've nto touched electronics since I was 16
<Dumori> more or less
<Saturn> 08,01Saturn boast time: i got a scholarship to St Andrews
<sammiver> +phase4 can i get your autograph?
<Dumori> Sation fuck you I got a U in A2
<Phase4> 00,02i want to build stuff like that but i has no money
<Dumori> math
<Dumori> Saturn*
<Phase4> 00,02sammiver, over the internet?
<JRP> I has spoiler Nows
<sammiver> +phase4 yes
<Dumori> I messed up my 18th year SO hard
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn is best Station
<Saturn> 08,01Dumori: i got a scholarship for the Comp Sci degree at St Andrews without having any qualifications in the subject
<Dumori> I actually have a C or D in compsci
<Dumori> cos I did no corsework for 2 years
<Vivix> I dropped out and went to a no-degree music school
<Saturn> 08,01Dumori: you're still my favourite princess <3
*Vivix unemployed
*Jmo glomps Vivix
<Dumori> Tbh I just tossed off at college
<Vivix> I got a B in math though
<Vivix> like the exam
*Vivix hugs Jmo
<Dumori> 20% attedence in pysics almost kicked out of the place for that
<Dumori> got 98% on the final
<Vivix> !
<sammiver> +phase4 or i can go to your house and get it where do you live?
<Jmo> LOl
<Saturn> 08,01i'm going to be studying acoustics and music technology for my Masters degree
<Saturn> 08,01it's gonna be AMAZING
<Phase4> 00,02sammiver, depends on how good a swimmer you are :P
<Dumori> and 60% of that was subject I had no lectures in ever
<Vivix> The end of community college, the music school, me and my friends went to maybe--one class a week. and since it was project we got no absence
<Phase4> 00,02gota swim all the way to aus
<Dumori> all self taught stuff
<Bronysith> Saturn: very nice
<Dumori> Saturn I R JELLY
<Vivix> Nice
<Saturn> 08,01well, either that or particle physics
<Dumori> Though to day I gave up on music as a hobby, cos I cba with it
<sammiver> i can swim very good....and by that i mean im just going to take a boat
<Saturn> 08,01i've not decided yet
<Bronysith> TRIVIA TIME BITCHES: what is the first animated movie ever?
<Vivix> dunno
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: your mum and a big black dude
<Vivix> Rotoscope horse animation test?
<Dumori> ^
<Pearly> your jelly? Can I be beanut Butter?
<Jmo> dat beanut butter o.o
<Pearly> peanut butter*
<Major> Hi all :P
<Vivix> I kinda want to go back to school, and work my way into performing arts college
<Vivix> but I need a job, so that might be a bad idea
<MadSurge> Saturn: :D DAT BURN
<Dumori> Bronysith define film in that question please.
<Pearly> How are you everypony?
<Bronysith> Dumori: full length movie
<Vivix> I good, you good?
<Dumori> humm IDK then
<MASF123> LOl. Saturn.
<Pearly> I am good
<Vivix> well full lenght movie would be what..1940s?
<Bronysith> Dumori: snow white nad the seven dwarves
<Vivix> most animations were preshow things for cinemas, not full length
<Dumori> I doubt it sir
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Snow White and the Seven Dwarves?
<sammiver> +phase4 DO YOU LIVE IN AUSTRALIA I LOVE THAT PLACE BUT I LIVE IN but i live in sweden which is the other side of the earth :'( but i will still get your autograph
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: yup
<Gold_Demona> Dang it I type too slow
<Dumori> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ap%C3%B3stol
<killerpony7733> Gold_Demona: Indeed you type slow
<Vivix> Snow white was maybe the first full length, but it was far from the first animated film or show
<killerpony7733> I can dispence several messages in the matter of a minute
<Jmo> 
<Dumori> Vivix it's not even the first
<Vivix> Gimme my box!
<Dumori> first in techicolour though
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: at least you don't make typos :D
<Vivix> Dumori: mmm, was Steamboat Willy full length? (80+min)
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I try not to anyway. I don't always succeed. :P
<Dumori> that's the first with synced sound
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: same
<Vivix> So first might have been..Fleischer animation. If any of those were over 30 minutes
<Lil_B> I think things have to shift a lot nowerdays, there are too many kids and young people, living in parts of their country where tehy get little to none backup for their future, live, there people don't even have the chance in their early education to do what they are interested in, they are just trained to become dull factory workes
<sammiver> +phase4 when are you going to stream again?
<Vivix> Education is important
<Phase4> 00,02sammiver, maybe tomorow
<Jmo> But Phase4, it is tomorrow. :P
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I doubt any of those older cartoons even go UP to 30 minutes
<Gold_Demona> Since they were mostly made to play before movies in the theaters
<Vivix> Gold_Demona: true..now I'm curious as to what IS the first full length, though
<thelonepony> morning everypony
<Saturn> 08,01ho-ly-shit
<Pearly> I found out that The Story of the Kelly Gang was the first (in 1906)
<Vivix> Gold_Demona: yeah, like..audience warmup
<Bronysith> Saturn: muffins?
<Saturn> 08,01you know Malcolm MacDowell?
<Bronysith> ya?
<sammiver> +phase4 ok......but i still want your autograph....send it as a messege please i will pay you with muffins
<Vivix> Kelly Gang was full length?
<Saturn> 08,01the guy who played Soren in Star Trek: Generations
<Saturn> 08,01and the evil guy in Tank Girl
<Dumori> ja
<Dumori> go on
<Saturn> 08,01and Linderman in Heroes
<sammiver> +phase4 MUFFINS
<Saturn> 08,01he's the same guy who played the main character, Alex, in A Clockwork Orange
<Saturn> 08,01mind = blown
<Vivix> Aah-
<Dumori> X3
<MadSurge> Saturn: :O
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, check other room
<TheMaster> how Horrorshow
<Vivix> I went to see that movie with friends, really excited cause Al Jean said it was amazing. I left half way through
<Dumori> FYI that's why I'm called Alex due to A Clockwork Orange
<Pearly> it was 70 min long
<TheMaster> Vivix you wern't a fan of a bit of ultraviolence?
<Vivix> Pearly: I think that's full length, now I kinda want to see it
<Vivix> TheMaster: the violence wasn't that bad, it just felt pointless to me, so we left early
<Dumori> Vivix: read the book
<Vivix> To each their own
<Dumori> it's better imho
<Pearly> Me too now
<MASF123> Saturn the actor that acidentically got his pupil cut in the brainwashing scene? :O
<Vivix> Hmm, well maybe I'll read it if I find it
<Vivix> My favourite trad.animation film is Bambi- never really seen enough before that era of style to know much about it
<Dumori> Bambi I've never fully seen
<Vivix> I saw it properly this year, after seeing it as a kid
<Dumori> IIRC it freake dme the fuck out as a kinder
<Vivix> and it was..so good
<MASF123> Bambi seen it as a kid.
<Dumori> but I'm talking toddler
<Vivix> and the documentary abou the making of it? oh my god
<Vivix> yeah, I didn't remember anything of it from seeing it as kid
<sammiver> What is blue and fluffy?
<MASF123> I laughed at the birds going crazy and later getting shot part. I was a fucked up kid.
<Saturn> 08,01MASF123: yup
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> most kids are
<Pearly> The kelly Gang is on ebay but in PAL
<Vivix> especially ADHD and ADD can give you odd tastes like that that may fade over time
<Pearly> for 32.99
<Vivix> I live in PAL land
<Vivix> hm
<Jmo> 'PAL land'
<Vivix> I thouht maybe it would be on Perlinger Archives
<MASF123> yup at which one Saturn I said two things.

<Pearly> I still need to play uncharted 3 :D
<Lil_B> Eli yeah... good thing I have both Soundtracks XD
<Pearly> what other color should I have in my hair? http://i48.tinypic.com/2m5xugl.jpg
<Eli> Sazh's theme is so chill :)
<CCCP> i liek Vladimir Lenin
<Bronysith> Pearly: shame on you
<killerpony7733> ^
<Bronysith> Pearly: it is just a yellow pinkie pie with wings
<CCCP> no me gusta Joseph Stalin
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Dat alicorn OC
<Bronysith> Pearly: so uncreative man
<Eli> Bronysith: and a horn...
<CCCP> Pearly i liek it
<CCCP> :3
<Bronysith> LAME OC IS LAME
<Pearly> well my name is Pearly Pie
<Jmo> >__>
<Vivix> Chill Bronysith
<Bronysith> Pearly: and you make it related to pinkie pie
<Bronysith> DOUBLE SHAME ON YOU
<Vivix> I would have a contrast in the hair completely
<CCCP> Bronysith thats not very nice
<AJIsAwesome> Hey guys. Even if it's uncreative, we sjouldn't be dicks to Pearly.
<AJIsAwesome> *shouldn't*
*Jmo nomths Vivix
<Vivix> ^^
<Pearly> well the colors, not what it lookslike
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, urge to complain....wising
*Gold_Demona agrees with AJIcAwesome
<CrimsonPhoenix> rising**
<Eli> guys don't be so awful about it... but there ARE more than enough over the top OCs out there...
<Jmo> Dat Ic o.o
<Vivix> Pearly: I'd try to find a contrasting colour for mane, and just have a related shade as second mane
<Bronysith> Pearly: either make it a unicorn or pegasus
<AJIsAwesome> Pearly: I like it. It could use some originality, but I like it.
<Pearly> I asked what other color should the third color be for my hair
<Bronysith> Pearly: not a stupid alicorn. TEHRE ARE ONLY 3 ALICORNS
<Gold_Demona> lol typo
<CCCP> USSR > Western hemisphere
<Vivix> 2 alcirons Bronysith, and several winged pegasi in the royal family
<AJIsAwesome> Pearly: Try not to focus on making it an Alicorn.
<Vivix> winged unicorns*
<Bronysith> Vivix: whatever
<Pearly> a megasus with nor horn?
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: So Cadence isn't an alicorn?
<Bronysith> Vivix: winged pegasi?
<Pearly> pegasus*
<CCCP> For some reason bronies hate alicorns that arn't Canon... cus bronies are wierd
<Vivix> weell, she's halfblooded or something
<Bronysith> Vivix: WTF
<Vivix> Winged unicorn*
<Eli> Bronysith: i wouldn't say that. there can be more alicorns, but if you create an alicorn, do it in a possible context
<Bronysith> Vivix: I THOUGHT ALL PEGASI HAD WINGS?!
<Vivix> She ages at rate of Twilight, and marries a mortal. I don't think shes full blooded
<Lil_B> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW578GeFTw4
<Vivix> Bronysith: it's a typo, chill
<Pearly> AJIsAwesome, I am going to redraw, here is the drawing I did
<CCCP> hail Santa
<kidzrul434> My celestia bronies. My dad took me for a long walk
<Pearly> http://i50.tinypic.com/2yxopk2.jpg I see that is too ywllow and gold
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN3AOyNVFrU C:
<Bronysith> if i see another person make an alicorn or winged unicorn and they are just rip offs of the mane six i am going to bust a nut
<Vivix> I would do a more active contrast for her mane, make her less yellow
<AJIsAwesome> Pearly: It's nice. If you're going to give her a personality, don't make her a Mary Sue.
<killerpony7733> alicorn+mary sue
<killerpony7733> God no
<Pearly> haha its just a description I got from a quiz
<kidzrul434> I feel sweaty and exhausted
<Vivix> my OC's are a Cervine mix and a Goatalope hybrid- I need a pony
<Bronysith> fucking alicorn ocs
<Gold_Demona> Mine's just a pegasus.
<Pearly> AJIsAwesome, Oh I am tring not to
<Bronysith> not very creative
<Bronysith> at all
<Eli> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmaUjvUetmQ&feature=player_detailpage
<Eli> baaam
<Gold_Demona> Nothing special about her. She's just a pegasus.
<CCCP> Cant we agree that pretty much all OC's suck?
<AJIsAwesome> Are we seriously going to complain about people's OCs. If we keep this up, we'll be no different from Sonic fans.:|
<Vivix> OC = Original Character, so I do not agree
<Bronysith> CCCP: yea, cause most OCs are alicrons
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: is truth in those words
<Bronysith> alicorns
<Pearly> going from scratch would be rather hard, would it?
<Gold_Demona> Wow, harsh guys
<Vivix> OC's are original charaacters, all the char's in MLP are OC's
<killerpony7733> ^
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I don't have an OC, but it would be an earth pony just out of modesty :D
<Pearly> Ijust like the fact I have wings
<Bronysith> thats enough final fantasy 8 for now
<CCCP> Bronysith i mean if people like them im fine with it, but most OC's are the same
*CCCP hugs Pearly
<LoGaN> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkcU54BO6Q4
<Bronysith> CCCP: BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL ALICORNS
*Pearly hugs CCCP
<Sumica> 00,10\
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Mine's not an alicorn. >=/
<CCCP> Bronysith Alicorns arnt that bad
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: i said most, not all
<CCCP> Sumica hello
<RaveBrony> Hey there, Sumica :)
<Bronysith> CCCP: people insist on making theirs alicorns
<Eli> yeah, made my OC a pegasus too
<Vivix> most aren't alicorns, because of what OC is by definition
<MadSurge> Bronysith: only Faust can have an alicorn OC! :D
*Bronysith glomps Sumica in rage
<Bronysith> MadSurge: THANK YOU
<CCCP> Bronysith do you have an OC?
<AJIsAwesome> Alicorns are fine, as long as they aren't Mary Sues.
<Pearly> the pinkie pie hair is still up in the air...
<Bronysith> CCCP: yes, A UNICORN
<Sumica> 00,10fucking game crash
<Bronysith> Pearly: get rid of it

<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Don't be a dick. Instead give advice on how to change it instead.
*CCCP huggies Sumica
<Bronysith> Pearly: get rid of that OC and actually make an oc
<CCCP> MadSurge its cus of the Great Depression and the Dust bowl so they couldnt grow food
<Bronysith> Pearly: how about instead of using pony creator, get someone to draw it on a tablet
<Saturn> 08,01rainbow have faith!
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome But the fact is that's not the case as most are OP as hell when they are alicorns meaning they are better then all
<Saturn> 08,01you see i will bet you
<AJIsAwesome> Instead of being dicks and insulting people, why not just give them advice?
*Bronysith glomps Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01somewhere out there is a pet that will get you

<MadSurge> CCCP: don't get me wrong, if it depended on my life I would eat disgusting food. Still...
<CrimsonPhoenix> JUST RUN YOU KID THE GROUND'S FALLING APART
<Bronysith> Pearly: relating your OC to the mane six is incredibly unorgiinal
<LoGaN> Saturn: what about LoGaN
<Pearly> Oh that is just from a quiz
<MadSurge> Hello BaconMane! :)
<Saturn> 08,01LoGaN: <3
<CCCP> MadSurge *huggies*

<AJIsAwesome> Is Wrek the oldest?
<Saturn> 08,01also, i'm sitting at my computer with a box of Belgian chocolates
<Saturn> 08,01life is fucking awesome
*LoGaN agrees with BaconMane
<Eli> 18 is an awesome age
<RaveBrony> O_O
<Pikachu> *say
<Vivix> I think they're a bit dull, but his style is very fluid and neat, but too cartoony to be cool for anything but a joke
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: HotDiggedy?
<LoGaN> Saturn: whats your real job?
<Vivix> yaeh
<BaconMane> 0,5The whole thing is a joke, thats why it's funny
<Saturn> 08,01LoGaN: chairman of a brony convention
<Vivix> Of course, but I don't think it's funny- it's not my taste, but his style is very suited to it
<MASF123|> the man is a sicko.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, define too cartoony
<Vivix> very talented animator
<CCCP> nah id hate to live a day over 18
<LoGaN> WWWWWWWWWHHHHAAAATTTTTTT Saturn !!!!!!!
<AJIsAwesome> DId he ever make SWAG.MOV yet?
<Vivix> no bones, too fluid, rubberband reality changes to designs, etc
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, not yet
<Saturn> 08,01LoGaN: i'm not even making that up
<Pikachu> wait is there a flim on?
<Vivix> He's GOOD, I like his style, but it's a joke style that I wouldn't enjoy in a serious thing
<LoGaN> your fahking pulling my leg
<Pearly> 18 is an awesome age
<Saturn> 08,01LoGaN: i'm also a research assistant in Computer Science at University of St Andrews
<Bronysith> if i had a dollar for every alicorn oc there is...i would be soooo fucking rich
<Pearly> wish I can be 18 again
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, well it IS a parody
<LoGaN> where you live well what city?
<Eli> Pearly: (\
<Saturn> 08,01but that's just for the summer
<Vivix> You'd have around 250 bucks bronysith
<AJIsAwesome> I liked the .MOV series until it got to the most recent one, PARTY.MOV. That was disgusting........:S
<Bronysith> Vivix: add 10 more digits
<Pearly> Eli, ?
<Vivix> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh yeah, I'm not hating on it. It's just his style, and I like it, but it's only really suited to that kinda jokes
<Eli> Vivix: a bit more i guess
<LoGaN> Saturn: can i come if your near me
<Saturn> 08,01LoGaN: http://www.bronyuk.org/about-us/staff.html
<MASF123|> HDD reminds me of the guy that animated Ren and Stimpy who has been to jail.
<AJIsAwesome> But hey, if you like the .MOV series? No problem.
<Vivix> I have seen under 5 alicorn OC's in my time at FIMFiction, unless I hunt for them I won't find more
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vivix, I'm sorry but you do make it sound like it's bad
<Eli> Pearly: 18 year old brohoof /)
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: /)
<Vivix> It's not my intention- I like his style. Sorry
<MASF123|> OC's are ok.
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: (\
<MASF123|> Shipping makes ne Lol.
<LoGaN> Saturn: aww the fahking uk? mother******
<MASF123|> me
<Pearly> agg, I think I would be the oldest here, but I could be wrong
<Saturn> 08,01i'm also the princess of the night
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: you're two years older than me... :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I do believe Hotdiddgey can do more than that cartoony style
<Eli> Vivix: i have once read a story with a pegasus that could do magic... worse than alicorns :(
<LoGaN> Saturn: your a girl?
<MASF123|> Saturn your Luna?
<Saturn> 08,01LoGaN: for the purposes of this conversation, yes
<Vivix> CrimsonPhoenix: oh yeah, he seems like a very talented guy. He's probably chosen that liquid style for the type of show hes doing, you know?
<MadSurge> Saturn: and the prettiest party princess there is :D
<killerpony7733> Pearly Oldest user here is like about 50
<Saturn> 08,01also, goddamnit guys, it's "you're"

<RaveBrony> Indeed
<Pearly> killerpony7733, ah ok
<LoGaN> yeah its you're retards!
<Eli> Saturn: no. they ask if you own a girl :P
<Vivix> Eli O.o that's odd. Yeah, In stories I'm very critical. But I don't tend to tell the author anything unless I think it would actually help him or her
<Pearly> I am just 20 years younger from them
<Saturn> 08,01Eli: yes to that as well
<Jmo> >__>
<LoGaN> any other pegasisters here?????

<Saturn> 08,01LoGaN: absolve me?
<MadSurge> Saturn: you and your CENSORED cutie mark :D
*Pearly hugs PillowPoni
*Jmo glomps PillowPoni back
<LoGaN> WHATS HAPPENING?!?!
<PillowPoni> MadSurge; I lold at that too
<BaconMane> 0,5EVERYTHING
<Jmo> LOUD NOISES~
<BaconMane> 0,5LBGEIGBEDG
<BaconMane> 0,5>>
<BaconMane> 0,5<<
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: heh, the censored cutie mark is just a bronystate in-joke. the actual one i normally use on my OC is a cornucopia
<Saturn> 08,01but that's also a joke
<BaconMane> 0,5cornucopia?
<Saturn> 08,01because... well, what's the other term for cornucopia?
<MadSurge> :D O U
<Pearly> well, I will be 35 this november
<Saturn> 08,01yes, that's right, "horn of plenty" :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't have an OC and I'm happy with that
<BaconMane> 0,5horn of plenty
<BaconMane> 0,5ooooooh
<BaconMane> 0,5So it means you're horny often
<LoGaN> i want oc
<Gold_Demona> lol I was gonna say "There's another term for cornucopia?"
<AJIsAwesome> Pearly: Happy eventual birthday!
<MadSurge> BaconMane: from the old myths :)
<LoGaN> i want OC how i get one?
<Pearly> Thanks
<BaconMane> 0,5LoGaN assuming youre not kidding around you just make one
<Gold_Demona> LoGaN You think of one. =P
<AJIsAwesome> LoGaN: You just draw one.
<BaconMane> 0,5Think of it in your head
<Gold_Demona> You get it from your head
<Bronysith> LoGaN: you commission an artist to draw you one
<BaconMane> 0,5Draw or think of, you dont gotta draw it
<Bronysith> LoGaN: describe them w
<BaconMane> 0,5Choose good colors that look handsome though
<LoGaN> umm long lost cousin of big mac
<BaconMane> 0,5Dont give accessories
<Bronysith> LoGaN: what you want and have them draw it
<thelonepony> use ur imagination LoGaN
*Bronysith murders LoGaN
<Bronysith> LoGaN: that means related to applejack, related to a mane six member
<BaconMane> 0,5Broken horns / chipped ears / accessories = NO
<Vivix> Applejack has like 5 million cousins, not too far fetched
<PillowPoni> OC has a two pillows for a cutie mark
<RaveBrony> :o
<thelonepony> Bronysith why? :(
<BaconMane> 0,5Also no connections to canon characters
*LoGaN gargle gargle (blood fills mouth from Bronysith)
<Vivix> I love broken horns and chipped ears, but not so much on ponies
<AJIsAwesome> LoGaN: If I were to give some suggestions, use the PonyMaker as a rough draft. Then draw your OC as the final draft.
<BaconMane> 0,5Its generally frowned upon
<Vivix> I don't know why it's frowned apon, since OC's haven't been important until they've been used in an actual story
<Pearly> there is mike none for pinkie pie at all...
<BaconMane> 0,5They arent supposed to be important in mlp canon
<Pearly> Vivix, haha 5 billion
<RaveBrony> Well damn, my OC has accessories O_o
<Vivix> of course not, fanon either unless they're used in a story
<RaveBrony> Well, hes clothed, lol
<Vivix> like Littlepip is an OC, NyX is an OC, and so forth
<Vivix> alicorn image with handbag on his head, is more an avatar than an oc since he has no story or use
<PillowPoni> I don't know if I should keep my OC a colt or not. I usually make them female.
<Jmo> Dat box should be your OC Vivix.
<BaconMane> 0,5I see ponies with like, earings and hoof bracelets and capes and spots on their face and dragon wings and lizard eyes and they're like "HEHEHE MY OC SHURE ISH PURDY"
<Vivix> Jmo: yeees
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: It's generally frowned upon in ANY fandom
<Vivix> Yes, but I don't quite get why people care unless they're used in something they read or use
<RaveBrony> BaconMane: You mean, using that stuff in Pony Creator?
<BaconMane> 0,5Yes
<RaveBrony> Not drawing them in general? O.o
<BaconMane> 0,5Using pony creator is fine
<BaconMane> 0,5But dont make an attrocity of an OC ><
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I don't know either. I make OCs anyway cuz I think they're fun
<MadSurge> BaconMane: as long as you don't abuse it/make a walking joke
<PillowPoni> I always have glasses when I draw my OC. Maybe because I wear glasses IRL
<Vivix> I've made a few, none of them ponies, and of course, none of them based on me or related to me in any way. But I haven't used them in anything
<BaconMane> 0,5Exactly MadSurge
<Vivix> Well, they're hardly OC*s, just designs
<BaconMane> 0,5Youre right
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/PPryN.gif
<BaconMane> 0,5THey're just Cs
<Vivix> Well, yeah. Some, but Original in legal terms
<Saturn> 08,01my OC is actually the Roman god Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01but in pony form
<Vivix> but mine have no stories or character. They're just designs
<NullRadix> You have a right to do whatever the heck you want with your OC, just like I have a right to gag at it
<MadSurge> Saturn: :D
<Saturn> 08,01he can buck things and make plants grow
<RaveBrony> :o
<Saturn> 08,01he can also destroy equestria if he wants
<Saturn> 08,01BUT HE CHOSES NOT TO
<BaconMane> 0,5Saturn: That's wayyy too OP
<PillowPoni> Saturn: is the cutie mark on that one the cornocoupia? (I know I destroted that word)
<RaveBrony> o_o
<BaconMane> 0,5Lemme guess: He's married to Celestia and gave birth to the mane 6
*Saturn 08,01can feel BaconMane twitching
<Pearly> I kind of like my pony, but the yellow seems too yellow
<BaconMane> 0,5o__e
<RaveBrony> Saturn is going to get nerfed next patch.
<Saturn> 08,01BaconMane: no, of course not; he's celestia's cousin
<BaconMane> 0,5GAAAAHGVKEG VLKJVG LEKBGUGE
<RaveBrony> Lol
<PillowPoni> And then BaconMane rage
<Gold_Demona> Pearly: Maybe make the yellow a little more faded?
<Vivix> hehehe
<MadSurge> Saturn: you're trying to piss off BaconMane, admit it :D
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: and i've not laughed so hard all weekend
<BaconMane> 0,5!!!!
<Pearly> yeah thats what I was thinking too Gold_Demona
<Gold_Demona> trololololol
<Pearly> I still have the PSD so I can do that
<BaconMane> 0,5This is my OC
<BaconMane> 0,5http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7e0q16tHr1r9oerdo1_1280.png
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I like your OC, it's unique without being ridiculous :3
<Pearly> but the outline, hrm..
<BaconMane> 0,5Stupid tumblr people, accusing me of being a friggin' carnivore
*BaconMane 0,5licks blood off his lips
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Thank you. =)
<Vivix> hehe
<MadSurge> BaconMane: dude, hay bacon strips as well.
<Gold_Demona> lol BaconMane
<Gold_Demona> Hay bacon strips ftw
<BaconMane> 0,5Exactly
<Saturn> 08,01i once sneaked a pack of vegan bacon into the cinema
<BaconMane> 0,5its like melted down hay
<PillowPoni> BaconMane: fat joy and happiness. I love you.
<BaconMane> 0,5:D
<Saturn> 08,01and ate it while watching Little Miss Sunshine
<Gold_Demona> Bacon is the best because it goes with almost everything
<BaconMane> 0,5I guess Ill link me thingie

<Vivix> http://mivix.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=scraps#/d5ar5ci This would be the closest thing to OC I have, a goatalope. But my avatar is usually just a nameless deer

<BaconMane> 0,5goatalope? o.O

<thelonepony> hai VioletLynnScraton
<Jmo> I regret nothing
<Pearly> working on color for my pony was something that I just have to tackle
<VioletLynnScraton> thelonepony: hello
<BaconMane> 0,5Colors on an OC

<Gold_Demona> BaconMane: Tell me about it! Oy!
<BaconMane> 0,5Aaaand Ash joins to THAT
<alexxm1> my internet derped can someone kick alexxm
<BaconMane> 0,5Nope
<BaconMane> 0,5You must wait
<BaconMane> 0,5You need to find the right color combo
<Vivix> I almost always draw black and white, or red and blue, so I hate colouring and choosing htem
<Yahooz> dat Ash
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> Lazy Vivix.
<thelonepony> alexxm u could of refresh the page u know
<Gold_Demona> That's really hard. It took me forever to end up at the color combo I have on my OC/avatar/whatever-you-wanna-call-it.
<Vivix> Jmo: Whyyy...yes..okay but colouring is boring!
<BaconMane> 0,5My other OCs took me a while to figure out their colors
<VioletLynnScraton> Jmo: Don't be mean -_-
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: Is that an actual command or just "/me"?
<Jmo> I'm not being mean! I wub Vivix ;~;
<VioletLynnScraton> Oh wow.
<Pearly> after I make my pony, I might make a page on FB
<Jmo> It's a mIRC command AJIsAwesome
<Vivix> I'm abused!
<Pearly> I like to color...
<Jmo> Shush you Vivix.
<Pearly> and to draw
<VioletLynnScraton> Jmo: No u.
<PillowPoni> BaconMane: is a silver mane compatible with a blue coat for an OC? the blue is the color of RD but a tad bit darker.
<sagas> Saturn, I swear it's impossible not to notice you in all the pics and videos of BUCK with your pink hair
<Vivix> I always get bored whiel colouring- but I love designing new characters, so it all ends up like uncoloured sketches
<Pearly> OH MIRC color.. ahh
*Jmo glomps VioletLynnScraton
<BaconMane> 0,5Hmmmm. Silver mane...
<BaconMane> 0,5On a light blue coat....

<Pearly> potato_pony, hi there

<BaconMane> 0,5Uuuuuh, yeah, scars are okay, as long as you draw them in yourself. At least that isn't a pony creator fature

<AJIsAwesome> VioletLynnScraton: :S
<cachi01|mobile> Not enough paraneters
<Vivix> I wanted to be a sexologist, because, even without being dirty or explicit, it's an interesting subject

<DaringDerpy> hi TiNYCL0Ud
<sagas> Vivix: Too awkward to be a sex therapist. Probably mostly couples counseling
<spitfirecolt> hay everypony
<cachi01|mobile> Technicolor little horses
<Pearly> hey spitfirecolt
<cachi01|mobile> Hi spitfirecolt!
<TiNYCL0Ud> I know what Mlp is =3=
<thelonepony> welcome to Bronystate TinYCL0UD
*Pearly gives spitfirecolt some tea and cookies
<PillowPoni> Hay spitfirecolt and TiNYCL0Ud
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we should change the subject......How about that local sports team?
<Vivix> saga yeah, but you also get people who have unwanted desires, and stuff. But just being a researcher, it would be- like the people who work for equality and understanding, and not just in humans. But in animals it's very little understood why and how and stuff
<Vivix> Local sports team?! I don't have none
<sagas> I love the Newcastle Ale commercials :D
*spitfirecolt takes takes the tea and cookies gladly
<Jmo> What is sports?
<cachi01|mobile> Tinycloud ok here is what we do. We wait for someone to stream PMV or a series or some youtube videos
<DaringDerpy> TiNYCL0Ud: most of the times someone makes a videostream
<TiNYCL0Ud> Ok...
<Pearly> :D enjoy spitfirecolt
<DaringDerpy> the rest of the time we just do horse stuff
<cachi01|mobile> Tinycloud then in fridays we watch 2 MLP episodes and 2 movies =D
<TiNYCL0Ud> Cool c:
<Vivix> saturday for us european slaggers
<sagas> Vivix: Wow that sounds like a very useful field. Very rare and specialized im guessing. I can see them working in prisons
<spitfirecolt> i love movie nite
<DashWithRainbows> Ah, welcome TiNYCL0Ud. Bronystate is a site wear bronies come together to watch movies and pony episodes on Friday (Brony movie night) and on Saturday (Same movies as BMN, just at a more convenient time for those in Europe, so it is known as the Euroshow.) During the week however, moderators may stream things such as games to art. Though, please take note to freshen yourself on the rules.
<PillowPoni> AJIsAwesome: sports ew. Why not talk about fluffy and fun stuffs?
<Jmo> tl;dr
<cachi01|mobile> Movie night is best spammin night lol

<MASF123|afk> However that's my Name 6 pick.
*Tovler resents Fluttershy since he's just like her in real life.
<Ponies47> I got hooked on the show into the first 5 minutes of "Lesson Zero" watch every single episode that was out at the time that same weekend.

<MLP_Brovakiin> ^
<DaringDerpy> no gloves?
<Tovler> Lesson Zero and Party of One are pretty much the best first-impressions episode.
<cowvarkian> no fingerprints left, DaringDerpy

<Rex_Mundi> Maxiburgers Tumblr is up to episode 19, it seems to me that the most popular pony in japan is Applejack.
<Ponies47> Spy!
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not related to AJ in terms of personality, but I find her inspiring.
<sagas> :D
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: IKR?
<Sumica> 00,10I cant pick a fave CMC
<sagas> Bet its Vahn
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: As in hard-working, and honest?
<cowvarkian> explosives
<alexxm> stable people are the worst
<Rex_Mundi> AJIsAwesome: Yes, Applejack is a rolemodel, more so than... Pinkie Pie, for example.
<cowvarkian> sagas: vince vaughn?
<DaringDerpy> such a drama queen
<sagas> cowvarkian: not quite...
<cowvarkian> mmk
<sub06905> so hard to pick best pony

<Saturn> 08,01even if 90% of people who do that course do not
<Rex_Mundi> Everlasting_Joy: Thats just sad, that show must feel this... streached. like butter scraped over too much bread. it neads a holiday, a very long holiday.

<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Kind of like Radio Graffiti. At least HIS broadcast is over.
<Everlasting_Joy> Rex_Mundi: Oh wait. I know.

<AJIsAwesome> Chrysalis: WOW.:O
<Everlasting_Joy> AJIsAwesome: Hey, we don't have to listen to him or Springer, and by not listening or bringing them up in conversation, we're going what we want.
<Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/221115039977

<MakerDusk> also, our backup website will be online within a minute
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<kirzstryfe> you see, when a server goes down, it's actually because they forgot to feed Kabaka again, so he gets hungry and eats servers
<Rex_Mundi> Was I the only one that crashed right now?
<cowvarkian> wait, im jim
<Everlasting_Joy> Why not gut his, well, gut?
<Bronysith> MY EAR SMELLS WEIRD
<cowvarkian> how ca you smell your ear
<Eulshy> Bronysith, how?
<MadSurge> OK
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: How do you know that?
*Major sips his tea
<MadSurge> RIGHT
<Lil_B> cowvarkian cut it off, ask van gogh
<cowvarkian> hmm
<cowvarkian> true
<Rex_Mundi> Who ells want to see an episode based on Twilights mom and dad and the other parental figures in the show?
*Bronysith puts a moth in Major s tea
<MakerDusk> Rex_Mundi: it was not, no
<Major> Um....
<Major> Okay...
<Lil_B> Rex_Mundi me, I'm always interested in Backstory on everything
<Everlasting_Joy> . . . What? They've trained turtles?
<MakerDusk> if you want to see what servers you were on, the command is /whowas <nick>
*Bronysith gives Major a box
<MakerDusk> kirzstryfe: I so tossed that comment of yours into the opers channel
<kirzstryfe> >.>
<Major> Okay...............
<Rex_Mundi> So, can we just assume AJs parents are dead?
<kirzstryfe> also, /whois and /whowas were both down right after the netsplit, is that normal?
<MadSurge> :D
<Bronysith> Major, dont you want to know whats in your box?
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Kandarihu> Okay, I guess that was a full-episode punchline to a joke that I missed the setup to.
<cowvarkian> sure
<Major> Bronysith: Nope, its just another box for starting a fire for me....:P
<Sumica> 00,10Kandarihu, it was the pitch pilot
<Bronysith> Major, sotr of right
<Kandarihu> Ah, I SEE.
<MakerDusk> kirzstryfe: they were working for me
<Bronysith> Major, it is an incindary grenade and it just exploded
<Kandarihu> I never saw that on Adult Swim
<CrimsonPhoenix> this is neat
<Bronysith> Major,so now you are on fire
<MadSurge> What is this song?
<kirzstryfe> probably on my end then
<cowvarkian> discord
<PillowPoni> Dance Sumi, dance
<Major> Bronysith: yay~ Now I can make Smores! :3
<Everlasting_Joy> Major: Mmm!
<MakerDusk> anyways, off to work with me
<MakerDusk> catch you all later
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Let's wait for Season 3 to explain.
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care MakerDusk!
<AJIsAwesome> MakerDusk: Bye!
<thelonepony> Cya MakerDusk
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: let's wait for canon to fill us in :D
*Bronysith licks Midnight_Stormwing
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, and then instead we'll have a Granny Smith is dead episode
<cowvarkian> fun
<cowvarkian> that'll be in season 4
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: THat's what I say to most fan things.
<Rex_Mundi> I can imagine that there can be based on Fluttershys parrents. What if she feels like a dissapointment to them because she doesnt fly as well as them? Like what if Fluttershy is descended from a proud line of fast flyig ponies and shs the odd one out?
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: that would be a riot :(
<Sumica> 00,10s3 needs seaponies
<cowvarkian> you know, the "wierd shit that hasnt happened yet season"
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> agreed Sumica
<Everlasting_Joy> Diabeetus.
<sub06905> other 20% falls on twilight
<MadSurge> Sumica: :D
<cowvarkian> season 4 = wierd shit that hasnt happened yet season
<MadSurge> ONE TWO
<MadSurge> AND JAB, JAB
<Everlasting_Joy> SB needs to be here everytime we play this :).
<Sumica> 00,10yes they need a body swap ep and a gender swap ep
<cowvarkian> unless its something like (anything with j.j. abrams)...
<Bronysith> season 3 needs more CONSISTENCY
<Rex_Mundi> cowvarkian: just wait till the next pony generation (G5)
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Sumica> 00,10but most of all s3 need 26 eps >_>
<AJIsAwesome> I actually considered working out with this video.:D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sumica for the body swap I want the voice to stay with the body and not soul
<cowvarkian> will it be executive produced by j.j. abrams? Rex_Mundi
<MadSurge> Sumica: I'm worried about what the new villain might be :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: I wouldn't be surprised if there's something in the background we aren't aware of concerning episode count at this point.
<Sumica> 00,10new villain is megan for g1
<AJIsAwesome> Nptice how Applebloom changes color every time AJ kicks.
<AJIsAwesome> *Notice*
<MadSurge> Sumica: :D
<MadSurge> BOOOO RD
<cowvarkian> with some stephen speilburg...
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: What a twist!
<cowvarkian> *spielburg
<Sumica> 00,10WOW dat heavy system lockup
<MadSurge> ANIME TIME
<AJIsAwesome> GHOST IN THE SHELL!
<Sumica> 00,10thought my computer died
<thelonepony> ^^
<AJIsAwesome> I think........:S
<cowvarkian> G5 mlp, executive producer j.j. abrams, and stephen spielburg...
<MASF123> noooooo!!!
<MadSurge> Ghost in the Shell time!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> cool GitS love the op and ed themes
<MadSurge> DIE DOLL
<shana> gits sac?
<Rex_Mundi> Im guessing that the season from now on will have less episodes, so they can have the show have more seasons and thus on air longer. Plus this gives time for hour long specials and maybe movie/s. If thats the case than i might be OK with 15 episode long seasons
<AJIsAwesome> Is this show still continuing?
<Fisheh_Fish> Good afternoon y'all :)
<Bronysith> haha Squall <3
<Everlasting_Joy> Never seen this show, looks good.
<AJIsAwesome> Fisheh_Fish: Hello!
<flutter_spin> YES YES YES
<PillowPoni> Hello Fisheh_Fish
<MadSurge> Sumica: stream Perfect Blue, please :D
<cowvarkian> as long as they have an actual plot in it, Rex_Mundi
<flutter_spin> Just in time for Ghost in the Shell
<Bronysith> Sumica, if you stream code ment ill let you stab my shins
<Sumica> 00,10would have to use hulu for that one
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: I don't know how many episodes there are, as long as they're good.
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: I don't *mind* how many episodes there are, as long as they're good.
<Sumica> 00,10not exactly a stealth tank
<flutter_spin> I remember this one
<cowvarkian> I sortof want MLP to stop being seen as a show for girls, but meh
<AJIsAwesome> That tank needs +5 Sneak.
*Bronysith glomps twilight_sprinkle
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle,hi
<twilight_sprinkle> was the chat ded?
<Everlasting_Joy> Scorpion tank?
<AJIsAwesome> cowvarkian: Same here. It was meant for ALL AGES.
<MadSurge> DED
<cowvarkian> sure
<Sumica> 00,10server issues twilight_sprinkle
<Bronysith1> ITS BACK UP
*twilight_sprinkle nomz Bronysith "Hai :3"
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: mkay
<Bronysith1> Sumica: it works now
<flutter_spin> lol. Hey Bronysith . You having issues too?
<sub06905> dat tank needs to be nerfed
<Bronysith> flutter_spin,it wokrks now
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought it was server issues, since i couldnt log in from any broser or my phone
<cowvarkian> Especially how people percieve male viewers of the show/ people who arent in the "normal" target demograpic >.>
<cowvarkian> but yeah
<thelonepony> love that spider tank
<sub06905> dat talking robot :D
<Dark_Horst> aaaaaand i'm back. first: stream lagging hard. secondly: what just happened with the embedded chat?
<Everlasting_Joy> cowvarkian: Who, or better yet, why, care what others think?
<cowvarkian> Oh, I don't
<Metronome> Am i the only 1 who gets a lot of constant random buffer
<AJIsAwesome> cowvarkian: IMO, there's isn't a show for a specific gender. Any show can be for any gender.
<rainbow> what is this called what is the movie called?
<Dark_Horst> rainbow: ghost in the shell. deries
<Dark_Horst> *series
<flutter_spin> "Ghost in the Shell" TV Series
<AJIsAwesome> rainbow: Ghost In The Shell. TV show.
<twilight_sprinkle> i want MLP to stay a show for children and not have it more adult-oriented
<Dark_Horst> anyone else lagging?
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<thelonepony> nope
<cowvarkian> I just don't like how people percieve shows should be for specific genders, AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I actually want a mixture of both, IMO.
<MadSurge> Why make AIs if you know they'll go berserk? /)_(\
<cowvarkian> But its just societies gender roles
<rainbow> ghost in the shell Ajisawesome? whats that
<flutter_spin> little lag, but I'm hoping it will work out
<AJIsAwesome> cowvarkian: Same here.
<Rex_Mundi> Is is wierd that I greatly prefere Brushable toys compaired to the Blindbags because i like the pretty brushable hair?
<AJIsAwesome> rainbow: Cyberpunk anime.
<LunarSS> this is my fav anime
<rainbow> ok
<thelonepony> a bit lag here and there
<Ponies47> Good. It's working agian :3
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: id prefer it if it stayed mostly for children, a few adult jokes are fine as long as theyre clean. but other than that, if i wanted tgo watch adult stuff id watch something else
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Nope. Everyone has quirks that make them who they are.
<Sumica> 00,10I like the McD's brushables they atleast look like em
<flutter_spin> Rex_Mundi: huh. I'm the opposite, because I like small nonmovable figures
<flutter_spin> lol, yeah Sumica
<DaringDerpy> who banned me?
<Everlasting_Joy> Rex_Mundi: No, nothing wrong with that at all. Heck, I'd prefer the brushables due to their (generally) better quality then the blindbags.
<DaringDerpy> and...is the stream down now for everyone else too?
<twilight_sprinkle> i missed the entire McD pony wave :(
<rainbow> lag!
<cowvarkian> But, people give no shits if women watch shows targeted towards men, or boys, but if men or boys watch shows for women, or girls then shit goes awry
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: stream is up, chat was having problems earlier
<DaringDerpy> oh
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: True. If I can ask you a question, what do you think about the abundance of adult jokes in Animaniacs?
<rainbow> boring
<MadSurge> cowvarkian: double standard
<cowvarkian> mhmm
<flutter_spin> But what men would want to watch Twilight ... the movie that is
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: ive never seen that show, sorry
<DaringDerpy> no stream for me...but chat works again
<cowvarkian> I love that, AJIsAwesome
<rainbow> why dis so boring
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I wasn't a brony until after the McD waves........:'(
<cowvarkian> I loved animaniacs
<Metronome> Double Standard is BS:|
<DaringDerpy> oh...now I have stream
<MadSurge> flutter_spin: snark potential? :D
<Bronysith> there we go
<Sumica> 00,10because you touch your self at night
*Bronysith puts Sumica in a ghost Maid corset
<flutter_spin> No lag for the past 2 minutes for me.
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, most media is targetted at men anyway. For a woman to limit herself to watching female-targetted media can be very limiting.
<rainbow> sumica whut the hell up no one likes you go away
<Dark_Horst> it somewhat works now
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i want a twi from mcd, but buying a toy from mcdonalds feels odd..
<fluttermac> im back
<flutter_spin> I actually liked this episode
<Dark_Horst> and barely did i say itt, another buffer
<cowvarkian> true, Kandarihu
<rainbow> s
<Sumica> 00,10how cute it's trying to provoke
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> he just trolling
<Dark_Horst> i think mips is being a bitch again
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Animaniacs is a cartoon show made by Warner Bros in the 90s. It had a LOT of adult jokes that most children wouldn't catch. Suprisingly, it had a lot of seasons and is critically accaimed.
<Dark_Horst> alt least in gemrnay
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: its ok for me
<Rex_Mundi> Hugs @Sumica <3
<Kandarihu> Oh. Jibogachi = Chekhov's Gun.
<fluttermac> IM BACKKKKKKKKK6_9

<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Why did you hug me?
<flutter_spin> Ghost in the Shell: TV Series
<Kandarihu> fluttermac, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex
<Eulshy> stream is being not good
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: well some people like adult jokes, im usually not a fan of such things. i like Mlp because it lacks the vulgarness of real life
<Darkts3|Trader|MLG2> hi everyone
<Sumica> 00,10commuting on the short bus AJIsAwesome
<Rex_Mundi> Uhhh, because AJIsAwesome?
<Dark_Horst> it's fun, becasue the german dub has the voices of stargate. all 4 of em
<Ponies47> Hey Darkts3|Trader|MLG2
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Okay.:)
<flutter_spin> I love this tank backstory
<fluttermac> why is celestia watching luna sleep:O
<rainbow> because rex is a gay lord and likes too hug he should be called happy spanas
<rainbow> or something like dat
<cowvarkian> Is that a no? Rex_Mundi
<flutter_spin> its Fleur
<Kandarihu> There's nothing gay about hugging.
<sub06905> steam needs moar G 3.6 :)
<Darkts3|Trader|MLG2> O_O
<flutter_spin> dat gun
<Rex_Mundi> im not gay
<Dark_Horst> unless you're starting to hump the one hugged
<flutter_spin> dat music
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: True. I only like specific adult jokes and there should be only a few. Not every episode should be littered with them, IMO.
<sub06905> i think rainbow needs a hug
<rainbow> kandarihu dont try guard him because your gay too
<TheKoreanBrony1354> seems legit
<cowvarkian> Well, animaniacs really wasnt for kids
<Rex_Mundi> sub06905: yes, G3 will be epic(ly bad)
<AJIsAwesome> rainbow: I think you need a hug.
<Kandarihu> rainbow, I'm not gay either.
*sub06905 hugs rainbow

<Everlasting_Joy> LunarSS: Because they can't think.
<AJIsAwesome> LunarSS: IKR?
<fluttermac> :)
*Fisheh_Fish thinks that making a big deal out of sexual preferences is silly. Hugging is hugging is hugging.
<Metronome> Wht's up with rainbow? so un-Brony
<AJIsAwesome> rainbow: Shut up and leave.
<Rex_Mundi> I prefere gay in its orriginal uage, oldtimey for carefree and happy!
<Metronome> Oh a troll:|
*flutter_spin coughs on swallowing a chunk of tomato whole
<sub06905> oh rainbow u terrible troll
<DaringDerpy> then why do you bid at all, Chrysalis?
<rainbow> AJIS what about no
<AJIsAwesome> rainbow: It's okay to not like things but don't be a dick about it.:|
<Ponies47> rainbow: It's Ponies47 and I like hugs. Hugging is nice and friendly :3
<rainbow> yay im a troll
<flutter_spin> Good salad. Just have to watch for those tomatoes
<DaringDerpy> I fear he will go that far, Chrysalis
<cowvarkian> I'm fine with people calling me gay...
<Sumica> 00,10nah you are not a troll.
<AJIsAwesome> AVOID TROLL BAIT.
<Chrysalis> DaringDerpy because up until i realised how much Saturn had bid, i could handle the impact on my bank
<Metronome> So he's a Brony troll??

<CrimsonPhoenix> >Hating on friends like me by robin
<Everlasting_Joy> Though I have a good idea as to where it's coming from.

<Everlasting_Joy> I'd make a "budget" joke here, but clearly GitS had a great one.
<Fisheh_Fish> cowvarkian: I know I shouldn't care, but their comments and looks that they give me when they see me watching it irritates me
<cowvarkian> hmm
<cachi01|phone> Eli Thx for somehow reminding me of Xion :`(
<cowvarkian> And they give no shits about the actual community surrounding it, or anything?
<Eli> cachi01|phone: poor xion :(
<flutter_spin> Fisheh_Fish: I showed this to my mom watch. She was NOT amused.

<Everlasting_Joy> sub06905: Coolio!
<MadSurge> sub06905: niiiice :)
<MadSurge> SPLAT
<shibaru> I just went to magic town and talked to the fairy lady and she told me to talk to her friend and her friend disappeared .o.
<TheKatPony> My parents don't really care :/
<AJIsAwesome> Suicide?:S
<Everlasting_Joy> My folks don't know.
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Eli> cachi01|phone: that reminds me: i have an old ds and the 2 ds games around somewhere^^ got something to do now
<cowvarkian> yeah, mine don't really care either, but they're fine with me watchign it
<sub06905> then she decided to watch 2 episodes with me
<cachi01|phone> Eli lol
<Metronome> ɾ
<cachi01|phone> Damn i need moneh for KH 3D
<Fisheh_Fish> TheKatPony: Yeah, my parents didn't care at first, but now they just shoot me glares
<flutter_spin> Naw. My mom walked away after 15minutes of the first episode. She did not approve.
<Kandarihu> This stream is toast for me.
<Everlasting_Joy> sub06905: Then what?
<cowvarkian> because you watch cartoons for girls? Fisheh_Fish
<cachi01|phone> Flutter_spin she laughs at me
<Boltasar> I just finished watching Mirai Nikki
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: So she doen't want you watching it?
<sub06905> Everlasting_Joy: she liked it
<Colt_magnum> Cherileee's a wwhhoooorrrrse. :S
<AJIsAwesome> *doesn't*
<cowvarkian> with good voice acting, and writing
<Fisheh_Fish> cowvarkian: Yeah, what's up with that? What guy would ever watch a cartoon for little girls?
<cachi01|phone> Biltasar is it like a yume nikki fan game?
<cowvarkian> and a nice community built around it
<Everlasting_Joy> sub06905: Nice!
<cowvarkian> and yeah, ikr Fisheh_Fish
<flutter_spin> She has this way of denial/disapproval. She rather I ... <insert X here>... then waste my time with <insert Y here>
<Panda> Sumica erm GITS?
<cachi01|phone> Boltasar*
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Panda
<cowvarkian> I actually watched like, winx club and shit when it first aired...
<TheKatPony> My sister isn't happy with me liking the show, though. She doesn't really believe I really watch it lol
<Eli> my mom would prefer me watching/listening Nicki Minaj rather than MLP because that's normal...
<cowvarkian> and other girls cartoons
<sub06905> my dad doesnt really care that i watch it and my 2 bros are also bronies :)
<cowvarkian> they're actually mostly pretty good
<Boltasar> cachi01|phone: no, its about a survival game, survivor gets to be the god of time and space
<twilight_sprinkle> teets are important plot element yo
<AJIsAwesome> To be honest, no show should be for a specific gender. I know guys who like Strawberry Shortcake and Hello Kitty.
<flutter_spin> Don't be a Jerry
<TheKatPony> Eli: Or obsessing with Justin Bieber or something lol
<Ponies47> back
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Welcome back!
<Boltasar> cachi01|phone: in english it would be called Future Diary
<cachi01|phone> Boltasar sounds cool
<sub06905> wb Ponies47
<cowvarkian> When I say "girls cartoons" i mean "cartoons marketed towards girls"
<Kandarihu> Jeris are all being turned into sexbots.
<cachi01|phone> Nikki is diary yeah
<Eli> TheKatPony: i would rather kill myself
<flutter_spin> If I watch something with guns, she will say "Don't watch that. It has guns in it." and walk away
<Panda> Sumica I dont recognize the episode, is this before or after the laughing man
<Ponies47> My mom LIKES me watching MLP. She's goign with me to Canterlot Gardens (Does she bucking have to? -_-) my dad is meh and doesn't really give to flying feathers
<Sumica> 00,10before

<Kandarihu> Oh, I just noticed that it's been a while since the last buffering
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: :S
<sub06905> might be going to Equestria LA :)
<Ponies47> cachi01|phone: I know Quick_Thinker is going. We're going to meet up there
<TheKatPony> I hate it when girls think they are gonna mary someone famous.
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: right?
<cachi01|phone> Oh cool :)
<TheKatPony> "DONT TOUCH JUSTIN, HES MINE!"
<sub06905> lol
<Ponies47> sub06905: Nice
<cowvarkian> TheKatPony: when you say girls, you mean teenage girls, right
<cowvarkian> or just the insane ones
<sub06905> or both
<TheKatPony> cowvarkian: yep, im not like that though.
<flutter_spin> My Toys R Us has a Justin Beuber cardboard cutout at the front gate. Gets a load of attention (and a bunch of laughs)
<Eli> i know lot's of crazy ppl. most of them are my friends. ok now i'm starting to think there's something wrong with me
<AJIsAwesome> TheKatPony: He'll be a fad, just like the Jonas Brothers.
<TheKatPony> Yep ^^
<shibaru> I guess the people in my house aren't the only ones who suddenly learned how to randomly teleport for no reason o__o
<cowvarkian> I forgot they existed, their voices changed, right? AJIsAwesome
<cowvarkian> then they split up and actually became something good

<Bronysith> cowvarkian: no, you press the trigger
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Major> cowvarkian: theres a little bit more to that :P
<TheKatPony> Ponies47: same here ^^
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: pulling it affects the trajectory actually

<Bronysith> Major: a video of you shooting the targets might prove it
<flutter_spin> free will.
<Kandarihu> LunarSS, yes. But her brain is real. That's what separates her from being a robot.
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: Yes! I have plenty of shirts I want from them
