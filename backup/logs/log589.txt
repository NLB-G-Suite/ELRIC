<otakon> CCCP: it's good fried
*CCCP cuddles otakon
<Lunar_Brony> Cavalluccio sorry if this sounds like a stupid question, but what?
<CCCP> yup
<Pudge> torrents are the worst way to download things that I've sen
<Pudge> mainly because people are selfish and DONT SEED
<cachi01> Lunar_Brony: to seed your torrent
<Jmo4267> ^
<cachi01> i never seed but well i dont know what seeding does
<mishia> otakon: .-. you know what makes me sad? lots of people hate sonic x because of how bad it was, when they werent hearing the better voices, lines, story, charters, and the unedited content in the orginal japnese that made it gold ;(
<Jmo4267> All aboard the pirate ship.
<Pudge> do you have any idea how long it took me to torrent halo pc?
<Cavalluccio> When you finished downloading it, please seed to keep the torrent alive !
<Pudge> 2 weeks of constant downloading
<Pudge> :(
<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 I don't know what that means. I've only used uTorrent once before
<otakon> mishia: yeah sadly 4kids manages to butcher whatever it gets ahold of
<cachi01> mishia: that fucking amy doll in the ending SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME
<otakon> THANK GOD ITS DEAD!
<CCCP> Cavalluccio: why are you so awesome?
<mishia> seriously people, go watch the japnese sonic x with subtitles. its so great :D
<Cavalluccio> Seeding means uploading it
<cachi01> Lunar_Brony: neither me but i thiinnk seeding makes it faser
<Polydunami> Is 4kids the reason Yu-Gi-Oh gets a bad rap too?
<cachi01> faster*
<otakon> mishia: but Rouge boobs....make me feel odd about it.
<otakon> Polydunami: yes

<otakon> Pudge: it's kirzstryfe as far as I know
*Ponies47 Thinks about Swedish Spitfire, Sits in a puddle of drool while still thinking abpout Swedish Spitfire
<Lunar_Brony> Pudge I believe it is kirzstryfe
<mishia> Polydunami: its the reason i thought it was bad, untill i saw season 0 orginal here on bronystate
<owloysius> seeding is bad for the person seeding, unless the tracker rewards it
<CCCP> Cavalluccio Everypony is my favorite pony!
<Pudge> otakon: oh because she changed her name to djnilla
<CCCP> G3 FTW!

<Maid_Angel> Firelight: rainbowdash and Fluttershy dont work well togather, i just loved the insturmentals. also, the song was less of a song that was supposed to be there for a reason to dialouge in singing form. Flim Flam brothers song had a purpose to be "sung" or talked in music: they were trying to sell a product, and musical influcence works well
<MystertyPony> superretroworld: i paid 250 euro i think! but you can also Get a baboo for about 70 Euro!
<AJTheMightyGamer> ThePretender: whoops sorry, i forgot. you got it. no vid links
<Dovah> ThePretender: wait... so it has to be an image link? I though ti was just no video links..
<Lunar_Maid> that took effort!

<superretroworld> MystertyPony: they both work fine?
<Lunar_Maid> MUFFIN!!
<Maid_Angel> cupcakes dosent count because the pinkiepie charter is supposed to dialouge sing, so she is exsemt from the "singing without reasons" rule
<cachi_maid01> scotaloos wings
<Firelight> Lunar_Maid: Oh it's nothing special... It's Just MAH Bass Cannon!
<cachi_maid01> i dont like this scootaloos wings version

<Polydunami> Why am I suddenly reminded of Earthbound?
<CrimsonPhoenix> he could've done it way better

<Ponies47> brb
<AJTheMightyGamer> cachi_maid01: not sure if portal 2... or pewdiepie facade\
<AttacktheMaid> White_Lightning: Spring by Griffin Village (or JackleApp)
<MysteryMaid> Firelight: right click name
<cachi_maid01> FACADE!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Firelight, right click on the person of choice in the user list and click on query
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03...noooo
<Polydunami> Facade is kind of a glitchy game, isn't it?
<cachi_maid01> i just found out about facade and i fucking love it!
<AJTheMightyGamer> cachi_maid01: was i right?
<cachi_maid01> AJTheMightyGamer: eeyup lol
<Lunar_Maid> WTF is Facade?
<Maid_Angel> reminds me! tonight is "listen to/read creepypasta". this time im not reading them. Since i always spoil the video :| ruining the tention that the read verison genrates
<AJTheMightyGamer> hooray i wins!
<cachi_maid01> Lunar_Maid: its a very awesome game
<cachi_maid01> download it
<cachi_maid01> and play it
<cachi_maid01> you will know what to do
<Polydunami> I've only seen a video of it by raocow, cachi_maid01.
<cachi_maid01> Polydunami: you must play it!
<Maid_Angel> pink unicorn?
<Maid_Angel> Huh
<Lunar_Maid> cachi_maid01 . . . nah
<cachi_maid01> red
<Maid_Angel> it looks pink

<cachi_maid01> Lunar_Maid: you can speak with the characters
<Lunar_Maid> cachi_maid01 so is "Drinking is Magic"
<MysteryMaid> cachi_maid01: hvoes is it?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Woah!
<Maid_Angel> Lunar_Maid: when do you take a drink?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Now that's a nice pic :D Good blending in
<cachi_maid01> Lunar_Maid: lol drinking is magic?
<Maid_Angel> Lunar_Maid: oh right, whenever a pony verison of a word is used!
<Polydunami> Apparently, you're a third party to an arguing husband and wife. That's what facade is :P
<Supersaga> so whats goin on?
<White_Lightning> its a unicorn
<hen3ry> no. Drinking is not magic. Beer itself, perhaps, but not the act of drinking it. I quibble with this assertion!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I... still don't get it
<Lunar_Maid> Maid_Angel I'm thinking of something else. cachi_maid01 I'll post the pic. brb
<MirrorImage> hen3ry - you obviously haven't made a social gathering out of the act then
<superretroworld> anybody got a guess whos the unicorn?
<White_Lightning> i have had a stressfull day, time to wind down
<hen3ry> MirrorImage: social gatherings are the exact opposite of magic.
<MirrorImage> there's a reason people will have vast personal bars in their basement
<MirrorImage> and hell, my boss has one of them
<MysteryMaid> cachi_maid01: we sould have a Bronystate friday drinking night! get somepeapol thogether and Drunk chat!
<cachi_maid01> Scoot-Scootaloo: just play facade and type melons...
<Maid_Angel> Polydunami: and because its a text-game that reconizes the weirdest things and dosent know the obvious, fun is had! like getting kicked out for saying "watermellon". try it, its atoumatic loseing

<Maid_Angel> Lunar_Maid: its missing "whenever a pony-edited phrase is udered"
<Pudge> First one for 360
<Maid_Angel> Lunar_Maid: or would that kill the player?
<AJTheMightyGamer> (gives Pudge a blanket)
<Lunar_Maid> cachi_maid01 you have to take 7 drinks for the OPENING ALONE . . . I suggest recording it
<hen3ry> alcohol intoxication is a serious danger.
<Pudge> not sands of time
<MirrorImage> Maid_Angel - depends on the episode; some of them aren't quite so hard on it
<Maid_Angel> sands of time...?
<cachi_maid01> Lunar_Maid: a drink for EVERY FUCKING PARASPRITE MULTIPLYING? O_o

<Pudge> and hai Pinkies4thWall
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> fang advertisement. No I do not want to start a dating service
<Dj_Cyber-4G> when will he/she get back>
<Maid_Angel> Lunar_Brony: out of criousty, i looked up some of the "old" twisted metal stories on charters. wow. a racing game with cutsceances and EVEN IF SILLY OR STUPID backstories worth the play. Its only made good by the charters, who mostly act like real people. ;( makes me sad for the ps3 remake of the first
<Pudge> Dj_Cyber-4G: who knows
<Pinkies4thWall> FOOZOGZ!
<MirrorImage> suddenly, PonyStep
<Pinkies4thWall> WOO
<Stary> <3
<Lunar_Brony> Pudge it is a celebration the citizens of Ponyville partake in to clean up winter. It is also a song
<Polydunami> Funny, my ads ask if I like Asian women... or Russian women... or East-European women...
<Pinkies4thWall> Who's streaming?
<Polydunami> Why?
<MirrorImage> Pinkies4thWall - kirz
<Jmo4267> HAHA Polydunami.
<Maid_Angel> ponystep: a sub division of dubstep, wich sounds way more- ponylike?!
<cachi01> Maid_Angel: calypso is a bitch lol
<Polydunami> My internet thinks I'm a pimp :S
<Stary> Is it just gonna be pony music all through the chat?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :D
<Maid_Angel> cachi01: he is, but somthing about him is fun :)
<MirrorImage> Stary - it is "Brony"state
<Pudge> Polydunami: why?
<cachi01> Maid_Angel: yeah he is funny :)
<MirrorImage> so it's highly probable
<Lunar_Brony> meh, I'm not a huge dubstep fan. So far, I've only heard 4 songs I really enjoyed
<cachi01> Stary: not all of it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> a bad thing about doing handdrawings i can't do small stuff yet
<Lunar_Brony> Zelda Step by Ephixa
<MirrorImage> although Wrek has more of a tendency to branch out when we watch him stream
<Stary> Oh, kk
<Polydunami> My ads are asking me if I like Asian women or Russian women or whatnot.
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami IKR?
<Jmo4267> Polydunami, if it annoys you that much go install AdBlock and you won't get them anymore.
<Pudge> oh yeah gotten those before
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> the living tombstone also made a zelda dubstep song
<Shizuka> 13lucky... i always try going small... seems to be why it doesn't work..
<cachi01> wrek is fan of viking metal \m/
<Pudge> adblock is a godsend
<MirrorImage> Polydunami - funny... i keep getting ads for "My Little Pony Toothpaste."
<cachi01> Alpha-Omega-Prime: yeah but it was bad
<Jmo4267> COLGATE.
<Jmo4267> BRUSHIE BRUSHIE.
<Polydunami> Actually, I'm amused rather than annoyed, Jmo4267 :D
<Maid_Angel> cachi01: except when he *rageface* killed john Doe. right after he rembered he had a family. seriously, whats more compelling then a person with no memeroy who learns of his wrongs, corrects them to his disvange? yep, then Cypt. shoots him.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Kind of yes
<Shizuka> 13i almost have profile pony heads worked out though.. the neck and body still elude me
<Jmo4267> Oh you Polydunami.
<Jmo4267> Such a pimp.
<Pudge> I wish Colgate was my dentist
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I smell like bread now :3
<Lunar_Brony> Alpha-Omega-Prime I know, he did the Song of Storms, which actually brought me to Ephixa's Zelda Step
<Sx963> that last song was awesome...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i can do a body and neck, can't do a face and eyes right :p
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> want to trade ?
<cachi01> Maid_Angel: yeah he is a bitch xd
<Dj_Cyber-4G> why is everypony always saying that lyra and bon bon are lezbian THEY ARE SISTERS!
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I found ephixa dubstep about a year ago
<Attack|DesktopPoni> What's kirzstryfe drawing? All I see is a red box around a pink-looking pony.
<cachi01> Dj_Cyber-4G: eenope lyra's best friend is carrot top
<Lunar_Brony> Attack|DesktopPoni that is a thumbnail
<Pudge> Dj_Cyber-4G: lyraxbonbon is the most widely accepted shipping
<Stary> That's what everyone sees
<MirrorImage> Dj_Cyber-4G - you better sauce that pasta real quick...
<Lunar_Brony> and hi
<Supersaga> Im actualy playing Zelda right now lol
<MirrorImage> and i'd caution you against it, because the shipping won't stop if you do
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I love Zelda
<MirrorImage> which leaves... implications.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> :| im not gonna]
<cachi01> what most ponies dont know is that lyra's best friend is carrot top not bon bon

<Stary> Yep...

<Kencolt> http://cheezburger.com/6438458624
<Maid_Angel> cachi01: Babyface is just sad. seriously, i wonder WHY she ended up in the aslyum as kind and pure as she is, even with THAT nailed to her face. She doesnt reach insanity untill cypt. decied to give her a moral delima .-.

<Lunar_Brony> cachi01 it's entirely fanon, so it's anypony's guess if that's true
<Dj_Cyber-4G> ive always kept under the impression that they are sisters and thats how my fanfics are gonna stay :|
<MirrorImage> you have no stream problems, he's just zoomed in on the little 50x50px thumbnail in photoshop
<Pudge> Pinkies4thWall: the streamer is afk rightn ow

<DeathStar> scottish-geeky: do you mean the look to your right one or my OCs one?
<Polydunami> In real world, it is.
<cachi01> sooo im a stallion?
<Pinkies4thWall> My laptop just emptied its battery from 100% to 0 in under 20 minutes
<Lunar_Brony> cratorkid I'm touching up on my OC. I need a cutie mark, I'm not satisfied with my coat colour, and I'm being overly picky with my mane and eye colours
<cratorkid> cachi01: since when did i say i was 14? havent been that for a loong time
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> it's possessed
<CrimsonPhoenix> is Sumica home?

<DeathStar> scottish-geeky: it be a deathstar ^-^ I wassn't feeling very creative that day
<DreamClouds> What's a good cutie mark? I need one for an OC.
<AttacktheAndalite> This might be insane but it COULD work! http://i.imgur.com/aAFNY.png
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica the object to your right is now your cutie mark. What is your cutie mark and special talent?
<scottish-geeky> DeathStar: lolz my is a video game controler
<Jmo4267> Mine is a computer tower..o_O

<AttacktheAndalite> Pinkies4thWall: Good god. How old is your computer?
<DeathStar> scottish-geeky: I hope it's not the same one as SB's because that could be confuseing
<Pinkies4thWall> Lunar_Brony: mine is a pillow. my special talent is probably comforting people
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica . . . epic parties?
<scottish-geeky> DeathStar: umm i dont think so
<Pinkies4thWall> AttacktheAndalite: 4 years tops
*Sumica shrugs

<AttacktheAndalite> Estimated an hour.
<DreamClouds> AttacktheAndalite: Dang o-o
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica I got nothin'
<cratorkid> Lunar_Brony: i have no official OC but i would have a white coat , X mane ( possibley just black { thats my actual hair} or something mor complicated , like spitfires or vinyls) and the only idea i can come up for a cutie is my ability to argue and debate { i plan on going into polotics), what would that looklike?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I have bruce lee hair
<Jmo4267> polotics.
*Pinkies4thWall wants a 12-cell battery for his computer for his birthday
<cratorkid> i derped , very tired Jmo4267

<Pinkies4thWall> does anyone have a link to that picture of the recycle guy with the evil face saying "TONIGHT" underit?
<AttacktheAndalite> Polydunami: Now, the biggest thing is how to get to the theaters. Most bronies are 13 and older, and unemployed. Convincing parents to let you go see a movie about pastel colored ponies is gonna take some talent and luck
<Sumica> 00,10there is also a 3d pony maker used by the ponycart guys
<Pinkies4thWall> i need that pic
<otakon> Sumica: nice
<cachi01> Sumica: cool

<Sumica> 00,10I think you left some bits on the pad
<oni_link> hai there Malavolent
<Chrysalis> its good thing this game doesnt properly model the exhaust

<CrimsonPhoenix> I would play that
<Sumica> 00,10but only in direct path not radient path
<Chrysalis> yeah, but only in direct
<CrimsonPhoenix> so much
<Jmo4267> nomnomnom
<oni_link> Pretty epic CrimsonPhoenix
<Chrysalis> man that is ALOT of fuel still in those tanks
<CrimsonPhoenix> also notice Pinkie Pie
<oni_link> I did :F
<oni_link> * :D
<Malavolent> Their hooves look... normal.
<Sumica> 00,10terafieing is't it Malavolent
<Malavolent> It sure is.
<Chrysalis> http://thedoghousediaries.com/comics/uncategorized/2012-07-30-bb7597e.png
<oni_link> I like how Twilight and Rarity are the only ones with MP too :P
<sub06905> dat Phase4 stream :3
<killerpony7733> oni_link: Cause unicorns :D
<Malavolent> Unicorn master race.
<sub06905> ^
<killerpony7733> Pffff pegasi reigns supreme
<Malavolent> If you could be unicorn, earth pony or pegasus, which one would you pick?
<CrimsonPhoenix> well one could be given energy points or such
<killerpony7733> ^Pegasi
<sub06905> Alicorns
<oni_link> Well if we go RPG rules here its like a weakness triangle
<CrimsonPhoenix> but yeah that is a nice touch
<Chrysalis> (unicorns || PC == master race) = true
<Malavolent> oni_link: How so?
<AssertiveFluttershy1> sweetiebot!
<Phase4> 00,02stupid thing is too heavy
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Pinkies a gypsy yay!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Then I got hit by nostalgia http://i.imgur.com/ktZwz.png
<sub06905> what advanteges would earth ponies have over pegasi or unicorns?
<Sumica> 00,10ok off to bed I go but first have cute comic. http://abrr2000.deviantart.com/gallery/32730709
<Chrysalis> 'night Mica
<sub06905> nacht Sumica
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Only getting a gallery
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Night
<OneTrickPony> night Sumica
<AssertiveFluttershy1> ::
<CrimsonPhoenix> sub06905, resistance, strenght, stamina
<AssertiveFluttershy1> :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> defense
<Malavolent> sub06905: Earth ponies have more raw strenght over pegasi. Also, they're the only ones who can grow crops.
<oni_link> Earth Ponies would have alot of attack/defense/HP. Pegasi would be speedy and Unicorns would have Magic but would be more prone to physical attack.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pegasus, Offense, Agility, Speed
<Sumica> 00,10yeah killerpony7733 it's in said gallery
<killerpony7733> Sumica: Ooooh
<AssertiveFluttershy1> :)
<killerpony7733> CrimsonPhoenix: Yay, Gotta love being a pegasi
<AssertiveFluttershy1> alicorn
<oni_link> Also, I think Earth Ponies would be weak against Pegasi because theyre airborne :D
<Malavolent> So basically, Earth ponies win over pegasi, pegasi win over unicorns, unicorns win over earth ponies?
<AssertiveFluttershy1> yes
<oni_link> Malavolent: exactamundo
<Malavolent> Yay.
<Malavolent> Now for MLP MMORPG...
<oni_link> This needs to happen Malavolent :D
<Chrysalis> hes not seriously gonna go to land with THAT much fuel is he?
<killerpony7733> Malavolent: Well there is a type of MMORPG in the works
<oni_link> killerpony7733: is there now?
<Malavolent> killerpony7733: Legends of Equestria?
<killerpony7733> Malavolent: Yep, and oni_link what Malavolent said
<oni_link> sweet
<Malavolent> It looks kinda nice, but they still have a long way to go.
<Malavolent> I'm looking forward to it, though.
<Emmie> i really dislike this mix :P
<Emmie> the constant "boop" sound is getting annoying
<Malavolent> I wonder if there will be PvP.
<AssertiveFluttershy1> what did I miss
<AssertiveFluttershy1> ?
<Mutterguy> pony vs. pony?
<AssertiveFluttershy1> ok?
<AssertiveFluttershy1> :P\
<Malavolent> Mutterguy: Wow.... that's just... perfect.
<oni_link> Mutterguy: lol but yeah :D
<Malavolent> Didn't think of this.
<Mutterguy> oh just Phase4's space program
<AssertiveFluttershy1> :O
<oni_link> wait guys, what would their mounts be?? o.o
<Malavolent> Humans.
<AssertiveFluttershy1> what the balls is going on!!!!!!!!!! :O
<oni_link> Malavolent: oh man :D I lol'd
<Mutterguy> MOUNTS? bOY WERE WE'RE GOING WE DON'T NEED MOUNTS!!!
<killerpony7733> Malavolent: Yeah still pre alpha ish, But it's going along well. I heard the unique trait for each type of pony subrace is like, Pegasi/flying and general access to most places, Unicorns/Teleporting, etc. Earth ponies/Can carry tons of stuff compared to the others
<Mutterguy> *where
<MadSurge> Good morning Bronystate! :$
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Good morning!
<oni_link> tbh, I think I'd be an earth pony so I can be a tank mwahahah
<MadSurge> ^
<oni_link> Mutterguy: lmao I just saw that
<AssertiveFluttershy1> ^_^
<Malavolent> The problem with pvp system in pony MMO would be that you are always at advantage while fighting one kind of ponies and you're also weak against one kind of pony.
<Chrysalis> inb4 phase hits something
<Chrysalis> Malavolent how on eath is that a problem
<oni_link> THATS MMOs in a nutshell :D
<Malavolent> Well, if you play as an earth pony for example, you would be always screwed against unicorns, no matter your equipment and skills.
<Mutterguy> NERF UNICORNS!!
<Malavolent> Which is kinda bad.
<oni_link> and thats what ablity trees would be for!!!
<Malavolent> Yeah, it needs some more though before it could be real.
<Chrysalis> anyone else think the guy in the song is saying back space back back spoace
<Mutterguy> what you just say 'Grow tree!' and bam squished unicorns?
<Malavolent> I don't think that's how earth ponies work.
<AssertiveFluttershy1> :P
<oni_link> I think that you should get abilities to close the gap
<AssertiveFluttershy1> lolz
<oni_link> is what Im trying to say
<Malavolent> What about charge for earth ponies?
<Malavolent> And freeze or any kind of snare for unicorns.
<Mutterguy> actually have either of you read CRISIS equestria? it sort of solves the problem by stating that everypony has some magicial power that's greater then their mere talent, for eample Applejack has geomancy and Pinkie has a stronger 4th wall bending power
<Malavolent> Basically WoW ponified.
<Phase4> 00,02trying to meet that thing
<Phase4> 00,02its 16k away
<Mutterguy> reverse course?
<oni_link> Malavolent: Ultimately, thats what it should be minus the repetive kill x many of these or collect x many of these formulas
<Chrysalis> oni_link then there would be no quests
<oni_link> Chrysalis: Well a good game would mask the formula so that its not so in your face.
<Mutterguy> It'll need lot's of story based quests which WoW does not too badly now.
<Mutterguy> *do
<Malavolent> Oh, story for pony MMO.
<Malavolent> What a challenge.
<Chrysalis> hmm
<Chrysalis> i wonder if he can get a kerbal into another ship
<oni_link> Malavolent: but where theres a will, theres a way.
<Mutterguy> We take alll the adventure fanfics and put them in the MMO? with various degrees of trimming? and wiggling
<Malavolent> oni_link: Yeah, I'm just saying there is a lot of work to do.
<oni_link> Mutterguy: Yeah that would be the easy way out :D but not a bad a start
<oni_link> Malavolent: Oh ,I know. I think MMOs are the hardest to develop stories and quests for
<oni_link> without being repetitive
<Chrysalis> this is a rather happy gala mix
<Mutterguy> So i guess there has to be some sort of conflict? otherwise it'll have run like minecratft
<Malavolent> Story: Trixie will get hold of an ultimate artifact and she wants to rule all of Equestria.
<oni_link> Maybe you can choose a faction? Like have it during the times of Nightmare Moon vs Celestia?
<Chrysalis> woo
<Chrysalis> NMM > Celestia
<Jmo4267> o_O
<Mutterguy> Well, by the end of the next series we'll have more villians to fight
<thegt90> if it no cooperate crash it into the moon
<Chrysalis> Phase4 whos remix is this?
<Mutterguy> so it could the Equestria vs the Evil league of...
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36ds_wnyMW0
<Chrysalis> thanks
<oni_link> the seven evil exes :D sorry i had to Mutterguy
<Malavolent> Speaking of seven, how about the bosses would be seven avatars of deadly sins - elements of disharmony?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> ...?
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6361769472
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Oh my. Just the sight of Pinkie Pie makes my day :)
<Mutterguy> Malavolent 6 deadly sins. No lust because it's a kid's show :P
<Malavolent> Yeah yeah, we know :D
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Why not the inverted versions of the elements of harmony
<oni_link> Malavolent: I was thinking just that! Celestia's harmonious army versus the elements of Disharmony
<Mutterguy> how do you invert magic?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> science?
<Malavolent> oni_link: Yeah, just like that. And for example, avatar of wrath could be possesed Iron Will. Avatar of Pride possesed Trixie and so on.
<Mutterguy> Well I know CRISIS Equestria used void energy...
<oni_link> Like honesty's opposite could be deceit and etc.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> lyes exactly
<oni_link> Malavolent: makes more sense than mine :D
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> opposite of luaghter...
<Malavolent> oni_link: It would be epic and non cliche.
<MadSurge> Crying? :D
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :D
<oni_link> Malavolent: You need to write this down for SCIENCE :D
<Malavolent> oni_link: I'll keep it in mind, in case the creators of that game would need any ideas. :D
<killerpony7733> Ear rape?
<Mutterguy> er hold on you probably need to look at http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/08/story-crisis-equestria.html <--- it's an epic read
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> greed is oviously rarity's opposite
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> obviously
<oni_link> Malavolent: Seriously, email them! Its a great idea :3
<Phase4> 00,02too heavy again
<Mutterguy> the bass is too heavy too
<Malavolent> oni_link: I'll just write it down, I don't even know their email.
<oni_link> Lol okay Malavolent
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> magic. ...nature..?
<OneTrickPony> I'm making a DnB song...what's a calm word?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> peace
<OneTrickPony> liquid DnB*
<Malavolent> oni_link: "Legends of Equestria Writers and Voice Actors needed!" Would you look at that :D
<OneTrickPony> thnx Alpha-Omega-Prime
<oni_link> OneTrickPony: tranquility
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Your Welcome
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Phase4: have you tried reentering Kerban as just a Kerbal yet?
<OneTrickPony> oni_link: srry but I think there are a lot of liquid DnB song named that out there, but thanks anyways
<Mutterguy> to the thesaurus!!!
<oni_link> ^ ^ ^ ^
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, yup
<Phase4> 00,02they die
<oni_link> and youre welcome anyways OneTrickPony
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> aww i must of missed it
<oni_link> Malavolent: If I was any good at VA, I woud so do that!!!
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> not sure whether to be surprised about that implimantation Phase4
<Mutterguy> Bucolic
<Malavolent> oni_link: Yeah, likewise. It looks like the game is trying to not use any of show's characters, so I guess this is as far as my idea goes.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I need to shave. I'm starting to look like hobo
<Mutterguy> imperturbation
<Malavolent> I'll just create my own pony MMORPG, with fluttershy and blackjack.
<Mutterguy> placidity
<oni_link> Alpha-Omega-Prime: I did, I didnt want to be called a neck beard :P
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Phase4: do they die on impact with surface or atmosphere?
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, surface
<Mutterguy> serenity!
<Mutterguy> FIGHT!!!
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> danke
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I don't shave my neck as I don't want a neck beard
<Emmie> i have a question for guys
<Emmie> do you shave your legs
<Emmie> or is that weird
<Jmo4267> lolno
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> No but I've done it before. The weirdest feeling ever.
<Mutterguy> I think only Swimmers do
<oni_link> nope.avi
<Emmie> oh
<Jmo4267> Shaving legs..haha
<Malavolent> Why would you shave your legs for Celestia sake?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :D
<Phase4> 00,02lets see if i cant try this again
<oni_link> Alpha-Omega-Prime: Well I get facial hair under my chin but it looks like it goes to my neck
<Jmo4267> Thanks for making my day abit better Emmie. Too funny ;D
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I was curious
<Emmie> Jmo4267 But dont you wanna be smooth :o
<OneTrickPony> here's my WIP/EP http://soundcloud.com/g3nesis-warfare/peace-ep
<Jmo4267> LOLNOP
<Mutterguy> I only shave a portion of my chest because I have a portacath that happens to sit next to my nipple and tacky derm pulling on nipple hairs hurt like hell. that's probably TMI
<oni_link> Emmie: I dont care, and girls dont either. Its never put me out of reach :D
<Emmie> XD Mutterguy wat
<oni_link> Mutterguy: haha maybe :P
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Not bad
<Jmo4267> I wish I didn't read that
<Malavolent> Mutterguy: What the buck.
<oni_link> bahahahahaha :D
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6309625088
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> No
<Mutterguy> I'm frequent flyer to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics so I have a portacath. It needs to sit close to the heart so mines on my chest
<Jmo4267> Fair enough.
<Malavolent> Oh well then.

<killerpony7733> Yay made it to the book part
<killerpony7733> Buck yeah! got to the ending
<AdamTheDuck> lol and I'm still doing the stairs
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck: Good tip once you get to the edge of the stairs going down hold OP and then press QW a few times
<AdamTheDuck> YAY WAKEUPCALL
<Phase4> 00,02ohai

<AdamTheDuck> lol why do I want to watch Phase stream QWOP?
<Sylandest> lol
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck: Cause it's rage inducing for those that can't manage to get anywhere? :D
<Sylandest> "hmm, there's a turret firing at me...should I do something?" XD

<Lil_B> hi everyone
<killerpony7733> Lil_B: Hiya
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Lil_B
*Lil_B hugs killerpony7733 AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> OH noes, green smoke

<AdamTheDuck> hi btw
<killerpony7733> minecraft: No youtube links during stream
<minecraft> sorry. didnt know
<minecraft> just needed to spread that a little
<killerpony7733> minecraft: Would that be your channel by anychance?
<minecraft> yeah
<minecraft> anyone know any better places to spread my link?
<killerpony7733> minecraft: Well you just advertised yourself and that is not a good thing plus youtube links
<minecraft> advertisment is always good
<killerpony7733> ^No unless you asked a mod and there is no stream it is not good
<minecraft> its exactly what i need
<killerpony7733> Note the I, It says you are are putting it up for selfish reasons
<AdamTheDuck> What's the point of trying to get views for a video anyway?
<AdamTheDuck> It's like all those people who ask for thumbs up
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck: View whoring really
<minecraft> i just want subscribers
<minecraft> and people to enjoy my work
<killerpony7733> minecraft: So?, Don't advertise like a douche and ignore rules
<AdamTheDuck> lol that was close
<killerpony7733> You ask a mod during the time there is no stream, If he or she says ok then by all means

<alexxm> hey guys
<AdamTheDuck> Hello alexxm
<alexxm> how you doing AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> Oh just fine.
<Phase4> 00,02urgh
<Phase4> 00,02i cant restart this
<killerpony7733> Yeah this part is tough
<alexxm> the chat seems pretty empty today
<Phase4> 00,02nvm, aparently i can
<killerpony7733> alexxm: Eeyup around 81 people +AFK'ers etc
<AdamTheDuck> how can you check?
<Buytoast> so some guy actually linked his own shit in here to advertise it?
<AdamTheDuck> Buytoast: Pretty much
<Buytoast> how pitiful do you have to be to try and get ponyfags to watch your shit?
<killerpony7733> Buytoast: Yep, Copy pasted the log and forwarded it to phase
<killerpony7733> He just waltzed in decided not to read the rules saying he has NO TIME to read them obviously ignoring rules and just going on here for selfish advertisement
<alexxm> did i miss something
<killerpony7733> alexxm: Just some guy who advertised his youtube channel with a video
<alexxm> huh ok then
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm: Oh just some random attention seeking guy who wants subscribers
<Buytoast> i don't care that he did, i'm just more surprised he went to this place out of all the other places he could have gone
<killerpony7733> Buytoast: Douche's like him usually go everywhere they can go usually like streams etc etc.
<Phase4> 00,02how did tong get the package IN there
<AdamTheDuck> That's what she said?
<AdamTheDuck> :S
<killerpony7733> My Little Bombs, Explosions are Magic
<alexxm> my little crow vengance is magic
<MaxTheBrony> Heya again guys :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello again MaxTheBrony
<alexxm> how you doing MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> Im good , you alexxm ?
<alexxm> i'm good
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, them Fallout Equestria hardcover books do look tempting...
<MegaMoonShine> Ancient Chinese secret, huh?
<AdamTheDuck> Seems legit.
<MegaMoonShine> Also, hi dudes :)
<killerpony7733> MegaMoonShine: Hiya
<AdamTheDuck> Hello MegaMoonShine
<Jmo4267> GOD THE HEADACHE.
<killerpony7733> He isn't supposed to be here
<MaxTheBrony> Heya MegaMoonShine
<Jmo4267> Damn, still playing Deus Ex.
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back Jmo4267?
<Lil_B> MegaMoonShine They developed it in the 5th century to listen to the mongolan Military Signals
<Jmo4267> Phase4, you need some food in your system bro.
<MaxTheBrony> Wb Jmo4267
<Buytoast> i know they do killer, but to come to a brony stream to advertise is like trying to sell AIDS blood to a hospital
<Jmo4267> Yeah I'm not fully back yet.
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Lil_B :)
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Jmo4267> Still building my side-pc.
<Lil_B> hi MaxTheBrony :)
<Kandarihu> Yeah, I guess Phase4 is sort of like our fill-in Nittany, even though he will probably still be streaming after Nittany gets his computer put together. Also, Phase4 doesn't hate playing Magicka as much.
<Jmo4267> lolmagicka
<Phase4> 00,02i might try magicka again
<Lil_B> ... I have this player that can play SNES (and other systhems) Soundfiles... but these continous and the songs never stops, I have been Listening to "Paranoid" from Rock'n'Roll Racing for 10 min now Oo
<killerpony7733> Buytoast: It's simple the guy has a one sided view on things, He think he is smart linking it to this place worst is he acts all high and mighty claiming his *TIME* is that important not to read rules and just charge in and advertise for the sole reason to promote his channel
<Kandarihu> Well, I won't really be available on weekdays as of the next hour.
<AdamTheDuck> Damn, my Magicka still doesn't work on the laptop :/
<killerpony7733> Buytoast: He will hopefully never appear again, Even if he want to as phase will get a mod to ban his host name
<killerpony7733> Buytoast: Or ban him in general so he can't get here again ever
<Buytoast> shit man i get it just saying i pity the guy wasn't expectin the great wall of chatta
<Kandarihu> To be honest, I'm guilty of some of the things that guy did wrong. When I first came here, it was for the sake of linking a video during a pony episode. But it wasn't my own video, and I had the courtesy to wait until the ending credits before I posted the link.
*AdamTheDuck feels strange for actually reading the rules before watching stream xD
<AdamTheDuck> for the first time I mean.
<Kandarihu> As for why he didn't read the rules, who here reads the full text of every EULA of every non-GPL program they install on their system?
<Emmie> hey guysss
<Kandarihu> AdamTheDuck, that's good of you to do that. Thanks.
<Kandarihu> Hey Emmie.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Emmie
<MegaMoonShine> hey Emmie :)
<Emmie> btw guys, anyone want their oc drawn?
<Emmie> I'm bored and I have my tablet out. ^^
<killerpony7733> Emmie: Sure
<Emmie> Killerpony7733 ref pleeasE?
<killerpony7733> Emmie: I can give you my OC details in PM
<Emmie> kk
<Emmie> pictures are preferred though :<
<Kandarihu> Anyway, what that guy was probably thinking was that the rules were going to be the usual generic "Access to this site is a privilege, not a right. Don't hack into the service to get access that only mods get. Don't post porn or hate-stuff or anything that can be considered discriminatory. Yadayadayada."
<MegaMoonShine> I thought that too the first time I came here
<Kandarihu> I guess he's seen enough site rules to figure that they're all the same.
<AdamTheDuck> Ah I still remember watching from BronyState for the first time and watching Phase4 massacre all the kerbal. :D
<AdamTheDuck> Best first impression ever
<Phase4> 00,02xd
<Phase4> 00,02XD'
<MegaMoonShine> The first time I came here I was watching superb64 playing Rythm Heaven
<Phase4> 00,02i thought there was more to this mission
<Phase4> 00,02but nope
<Phase4> 00,02desk is right here
<MegaMoonShine> I was like "Dude, oh it's this game from the pony animations!"
<Kandarihu> Since we do have nuanced rules here, maybe we should make it clear to newcomers that the rules really SHOULD be looked at and not just assumed to be the same old same old.
<MegaMoonShine> Oooooh, that's gotta hurt!
<Dark_Horst> there's a button "rules" that cant be missen on the way to the theaters
<Dark_Horst> if people assume they are above them, its their own fault
<Kandarihu> Dark_Horst, I'm not saying that he thinks he's above the rules. He assumes the rules here are just the generic rules that every small-time forum and every major web-portal uses.
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst: Exactly, The guys reason for not reading them was that he said *HIS TIME* was more important that he didn't want to use it on reading rules
<Ponies47> MORNING EVERYPONY :)
<Phase4> 00,02i love these pocket secretary messages
<AdamTheDuck> Mornin' Ponies47
<MASF123> If ponies could talk wouldn't that make them super intelligent creatures?
<AdamTheDuck> MASF123: And Ponyville is a nudist collony, your point is? :P
<Ponies47> brb
<MegaMoonShine> MORNING Ponies47 :)
<shana> MASF123: so what would you consider as 'talking'?
<Kandarihu> Guys, if you kept reading the same exact same thing over and over again every time you started using a site, would that not be a waste of your time?
<Kandarihu> I'm not saying that he was in the right. I'm just saying that I understand where he's coming from.
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: Either way, In the end you can't think that cause you are only making yourself look like a fool
<shana> Kandarihu: I haven't seen any community where shameless self-advertising isn't considered negative..
<Ponies47> back
<MASF123> shana, speaking in syllables of any language.
<shana> MASF123: ok now it boils down to what language is. all living things have some sort of communication
<MASF123> AdamTheDuck I wasn't trying to prove anything, I was merely just asking a question hoping someone would answer it
<shana> MASF123: you could consider DNA as a language..
<AdamTheDuck> Sorry, my response was suppose to be a joke... :S
<Buytoast> holy crap you people are still debating this whole advertisement deal?
<MASF123> shana good point even ants communicate with their feelers.
<XAX> Buytoast: How long has it been going on for?
<Buytoast> nearly forty minutes or somethin
<MegaMoonShine> What's all this talk about communication now?
<killerpony7733> Buytoast: I guess they are, :D
<shana> communication is an interesting topic
<Ponies47|MLPFiM> The Hub is having a mini marathon of PONIES, So if ping me if ya need me :P
<killerpony7733> But everypony the guy came in acted like a douche and he was only here to advertise and he broke two rules with a full on awareness of it, And he will most likely be banned
<Lil_B> or maybe you should shut up woman >: (
<AdamTheDuck> *Why can't we be friends, why can't we be friends?*
<Kandarihu> Yes. I suppose that he had better places to advertise his Youtube channel. If it's Pony related, somehow, that might be why he chose to advertise it here. And not having the patience to read the rules, felt justified to plug his stuff.
<Dark_Horst> if there was hub in german,y that might actually be interesting
<alexxm> wonder what episodes they're showing
<MegaMoonShine> Y I no have Hub?! :(
*AdamTheDuck wishes he could afford paid tv. :/
<MegaMoonShine> Damn you, Sky!!!
<alexxm> why does england not have the hub
<AdamTheDuck> FALCON PUNCH
<MegaMoonShine> God, these guards are stupid
<alexxm> who fools for that
<MegaMoonShine> "I'm in the doorway. There's noone here, let's move on. Doobeobodoo!"
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: Oh uh right, It wasn't even pony related actually. Nearly forgot to say that it was pretty much the new beta update for minecraft
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: He had no videos that match pony related content so yep
<Kandarihu> Ah, I see. You visited his link so that the rest of us don't have to.
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: He is also getting more thumbs down then ups so he is not just advertising it here
<Kandarihu> I see. So he got his just deserts.
<CCCP> hello everypony
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: Oh god what he has a DA and turns out he knows someone from here and it's all back from may
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: So he has been here before.
<deadxak> ti russkii ???
<CCCP> hi killerpony7733 Kandarihu and deadxak
<Kandarihu> No excuse, then, NOW he has no excuse.
<killerpony7733> CCCP: Hiya :3
<Texasboykc09> hello everypony
<MegaMoonShine> hello CCCP and Texasboykc09 :)
<alexxm> how you doing CCCP and Texasboykc09

<AdamTheDuck> Hello CCCP
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: Yep, I'm really scratching my head now
<CCCP> hi MegaMoonShine alexxm and AdamTheDuck
<Texasboykc09> alexxm good
<CCCP> alexxm im fine, you?
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu: Oh god what. He is a brony? seriously i'm losing all respect of the guy
<alexxm> i'm good CCCP
<sonicandmario85> YOU SHOT HIM IN THE ASS LOL
<sonicandmario85> i saw it before i logged in xD
<sonicandmario85> what are you doing with him? xD
<Derpy123> After this can you stream the MLP marathon? Plz.
<sonicandmario85> Derpy123:is there one on the hub right now?
<AdamTheDuck> Lesson Zero and Party of One right after each other...
<killerpony7733> Guy was kicked i think.
<MASF123> Yeah but I don't have that channel.
<CCCP> the nnext person to talk gets kicked
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Hello i'm back from turkey
<MegaMoonShine> Hello GreeHetBronyInDuitsl :)
<sonicandmario85> MASF123:i have it im using cimtel AND its connected to the internet so when internet goes out we cant use the cable
<AdamTheDuck> lol CCCP is going to kick a new guy?
<MASF123> no...I'm Derpy123, I am that on Derpy Day or when my name gets derped in the chat.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello GreeHetBronyInDuitsl

<AdamTheDuck> Hello RaveBrony
<Phase4> 00,02ohai RaveBrony
<killerpony7733> MASF123: Oh. Still i doubt it's going to get streamed
<MegaMoonShine> Hey RaveBrony :)
*RaveBrony waves to AdamTheDuck, CCCP, and Phase4
<killerpony7733> MASF123: Remember we aren't ponies 24/7 :D
*RaveBrony waves to MegaMoonShine :$
<sonicandmario85> whos streaming?
<MASF123> ...maybe I should go check the Brony Network for the marathon
<Texasboykc09> hello RaveBrony
<Phase4> 00,02dats enough deus ex for now
<CCCP> Phase4 i saw a movie called phase4 in a swiss movie store
<RaveBrony> Hiya Texasboykc09 :P
<MASF123> Yeah but this would be a special occasion.
<sonicandmario85> i see phase4s streaming XD
<killerpony7733> He is just ending his stream yes
<MidnightWonko> There is an MLP marathon going on right now.
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I was bored to death in a turkish village because they had no internet there
<MidnightWonko> On The Hub.
<Buytoast> oh boy
<MidnightWonko> I do not have The Hub.
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Meanwhile
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Me neither
<MASF123> So I've heard, MidnightWonko
<Buytoast> is Math neccessary?
<Buytoast> good god
<MidnightWonko> I had hoped this site would rectify that issue, as it has in the past for new eps.
<Texasboykc09> hello Meanwhile
<killerpony7733> MidnightWonko: We know, And it's most likely not gonna get streamed since again the site isn't ponies 24/7 :D
<CCCP> hi Meanwhile
<MidnightWonko> Awwwwww.
<MidnightWonko> :(
<sonicandmario85> MidnightWonko:get the cimtel cable box and connect it to the internet the hub will be on there
<MegaMoonShine> Allo Meanwhile :)
<Meanwhile> What exactly have I stumbled blindly into. Because it looks like Algebra.
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> No math isn't neccesary
<sonicandmario85> KERBALS!
<Phase4> 00,02KERBALS
<Phase4> 00,02: D
<MASF123> Ever have the suspicion you were being watched? :O
<killerpony7733> SLABREK
<Phase4> 00,02algebra should be taught
<sonicandmario85> i see you have virtual box phase
<Meanwhile> The Phase4 pony has been doubled.
<sonicandmario85> you should show it XD
<Phase4> 00,02it takes a while to get it, and if you dont learn it early you wont
<Phase4> 00,02lol double phase
<Meanwhile> What does it mean?!
<Phase4> 00,02i thought i started phasepony, but he went missing
<Phase4> 00,02so i started another
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> For me,math is like toxic (With that,i mean boring)
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Phase4> 00,02that
<MASF123> For that cable box that connects to the Internet and has cable, you have to pay monthly yes?
<sonicandmario85> Phase4:wanna stream yourself on virtual box?
<Phase4> 00,02is the fault of the teacher
<Phase4> 00,02not the subject
<RaveBrony> Math is a game!! You cant let the numbers win :)
<Phase4> 00,02sonicandmario85, nah
<MidnightWonko> It's trendy to blame teachers.
<MASF123> I suck at math...and just about anything else in life.
<sonicandmario85> i have virtual box too xD
<TheRandomkid321> I should have been asleep half an hour ago but can't from that horrific scene.
<AdamTheDuck> Still wondering when I would want to find a third side of a right angle triangle in everyday life...
<MidnightWonko> Sometimes, the student is to blame for not applying himself.
<Phase4> 00,02^ is allso true
<sonicandmario85> i put ubuntu on it
<Phase4> 00,02but the teacher is not immune to blame
<Phase4> 00,02i use virtualbox to boot my linux install
<MidnightWonko> No one has such immunity.
<Phase4> 00,02^
<Meanwhile> I blame Phase4.
<Phase4> 00,02anyone here got magicka
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, :<
<MidnightWonko> So do I, Meanwhile.
<sonicandmario85> i use it to go on diffrent operating systems XD
<MASF123> Hmmm....he appears to get the chat coming in late...oh no wait, that's the stream goign slow for me, I need to refresh.
<Meanwhile> I have Magicka. Haven't played it in forever though.
<shana> I use ssh to go into different operating systems :)
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Sadly nope, If i could get a copy of it now i would install quick and play with ya :(
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma start up a magicka game
<AdamTheDuck> Magicka doesn't work on my laptop :'(
<Phase4> 00,02shana, o u :)
*Phase4 00,02hugs shana
<MidnightWonko> There's just one combination of elements you need to know for Magicka...
*shana hugs Phase4 back
<TheRandomkid321> I was so close to being in a hospital bed right now... Bloody hell.
<RaveBrony> :o
<MidnightWonko> Water, Cold, Water, Cold, Thunder, Arcane, Shield.
<RaveBrony> TheRandomkid321: Why? :o
<Phase4> 00,02Midnight_Stormwing, Lightning bolt
<shana> did I miss a discussion about maths :/
<Meanwhile> All you need to know for Magicka is arcane mines.
<MegaMoonShine> TheRandomkid321: What's wrong?
<MidnightWonko> When used, it creates a barricade of deadly electric ice that kills anything stupid enough to walk into it.
<Phase4> 00,02derp ping
<Midnight_Stormwing> <_< >_>
<MidnightWonko> For the undead, replace arcane with life, of course.
<Phase4> 00,02steam things i need more direct x
<Meanwhile> ALL the direct x.
<Cypresswolf> I hated algebra in my college years - 2 of my professors were new to the US - got their teaching job at my community college, had such heavy accents and poor English I couldnt understand them
<MASF123> uh...
<MidnightWonko> For single mobs, cast on sword instead of force cast.
<sonicandmario85> TheRandomkid321:is it because they thought your crazy or something?
<Phase4> 00,02i'm doing calculus
<Phase4> 00,02engineering mathmatics1
<MidnightWonko> Well, I'm off.
<TheRandomkid321> RaveBrony and everyone else I wont repeat it again. I was walking across the road outside of school. A bunch of cars whee lined up so noone could see the other lane. I started walking slowly across and another kid ran right past me and got hit by a speeding car. I aint even sure if the kid is still alaive but the ambulance station was just down the street.
<MidnightWonko> Good luck on Magicka!
<AdamTheDuck> Night MidnightWonko
<MASF123> TheRandomkid321, that must have been one hell of a morning.
<shana> Phase4: neat, so you're going after an engineering degree?
<TheRandomkid321> MASF123 afternoon actually
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> What is this game
<Phase4> 00,02shana, yup
<Texasboykc09> does anypony know how to enter the lottery
<Phase4> 00,02electronics and electrical
<MASF123> So he got hit after lunch?
<sonicandmario85> so is this multiplayer?
<shana> GreeHetBronyInDuitsl: magicka
<Meanwhile> Texasboykc09: Sign up for the newsletter.
<TheRandomkid321> MASF123 after school
<MASF123> Magicka, whatever it's called. __-
<Cypresswolf> Had 1 professor that never showed up on time - an hour late on a few occasions - :| never did get a refund for that class, nor was the professor fired
<Phase4> 00,02after which i'm seriously considering an aerospace engineering degree
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Is that game brutal? I would love to know
<Meanwhile> Kerbals irl Phase4.
<Phase4> 00,02this is multiplayer
<Phase4> 00,02^ Meanwhile

<MASF123> Dat copy and paste

<Phase4> 00,02GreeHetBronyInDuitsl, nope
<shana> Phase4: you should try the game Kohctpyktop, it actually "teaches" lots of EE basics :)
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Oh ok
<Phase4> 00,02i've been through 2 years of tafe already :P
<shana> Phase4: (as in circuit design elements, flip flips, logic gates, etc)

<RaveBrony> alexxm: Bring me something! :$
<Phase4> 00,02shana, you done much electronics?
<RaveBrony> please?
<Meanwhile> What was the question asked when they decided how to make this? "How can we make multiplayer games as difficult as possible to join?"
<Cypresswolf> Anybody get one of those professors that tell you right at the start of the semester "xx% of you will not pass this class* and absolutely refuse to explain something you dont understand? Why the heck teach in the first place
<MASF123> Pinkie Pie? Lol.
<Ponies47|MLPFiM> Pinkie Pie is cool :3
<Phase4> 00,02need more players
<Ponies47|MLPFiM> Sorry Phase4 don't have the game :/
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> LOL
<sonicandmario85> Ponies47:you should buy minecraft its fun also watch lets plays of it on youtube and you will know what to do in it
<shana> Phase4: some, more high level stuff as in how cpu works. Implemented a cpu in verilog on a FPGA and so on. Also have an arduino and to experiment and stuff
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> It is great
<sonicandmario85> Ponies47:i didnt buy it though i got a cracked version

<pony_9866> i'm not sure i can do that...
<Dken2021> I think that's tomorrow
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: the clones wouldnt have been able to take the academy without a sith on their side though, especially a stih who was trusted by the jedi
<JESmith71> Tomorrow the prequel that's even worse. Join us for another good old chat riffing tomorrow when Episode II plays!
<twilight_sprinkle> sure, give star wars 4/10 but give that cliche zombie ripoff of Shaun of the dead 9/10 :\
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: inb4 I make template. :3

<twilight_sprinkle> schoolgirls with desert eagles... yep its anime time
<Shizuka> 13Dark92Enigma: star wars kicked off the whole THX thing, at the very end there it was like "if you have experienced problems because of this movie, call 1-800-PHONE-THX
