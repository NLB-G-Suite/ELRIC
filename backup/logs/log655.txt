*Bronysith puts Chrysalis in a full nelson
<Kandarihu|OldComp> I forgot exactly when in the S2 finale her name was given.

<Saturn> 08,01loads of people have had problems with them

<AJIsAwesome> CheesyLlama13: That depends. What are your friends like?
<Serenity> Saturn: Bloody hell. What were they made from?
<CheesyLlama13> Kind and funny... when they're not lying about me
<alexxm> what do they say about you
<CK|Catnap> T-shirts wearing out from just one wash? Should've gone with WeLoveFine. Or alternatively, better hook up with Saturn.
<AJIsAwesome> CheesyLlama13: They lie about you? They don't sound like good friends to me. :S
<Saturn> 08,01Serenity: unicorn tears
<Chrysalis> hooking up with Saturn is the solution to all problems
<Serenity> Okay, where's the guns.
<Saturn> 08,01i almost screamed when i saw what had happened to it
<CheesyLlama13> It's on the way to school, and it's only a few; they don't say things that are that bad really but it's just annoying
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: BUCK 2013, I can solve all your problems ;)
<AJIsAwesome> CheesyLlama13: I recommend that you have a personal talk to them, otherwise I fear it may go too far, IMO.
<Serenity> Saturn: I know I keep saying this, but this is determination, I will be dar!
<Chrysalis> can't wait for 2013

<ValtheJean> 2,14 meh, wrek and I have similar tastes
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and no, this is Eureka 7
<Chrysalis> eureka 7 a show about surfing
<Chrysalis> no robots
<Chrysalis> surfing robots?
<otakon> ValtheJean: ah the anime I dislike because 90% of the characters are dicks.
<Chrysalis> what the HELL was that show about
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05btw saturn
<otakon> Chrysalis: and a crew of dicks
<Wrek|MLG-Sniper> 05PM
<otakon> Chrysalis: apparently a kid growing up
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you mean the show you don't like because you're a prick
<alexxm> so it's a hentai otakon
<AJIsAwesome> It is?
<Chrysalis> ValtheJean actually, i liked eureka 7
<Serenity> otakon: Imagine that, a full crew of dickshep and dickjensen
<Shizuka> 13val is val again
<otakon> ValtheJean: no the show I don't like because everyone on that damn ship treated Renton lower than dog shit.
*Shizuka 13checks hell's temperature
<otakon> hiya Shizuka
<Serenity> Hey, Shizuka
<CheesyLlama13> Everyone's entitled to their own opinions ^^
<AJIsAwesome> ohai Shizu :P

<Applejack2011> bye!
<Chrysalis> Meanwhile of course

<Michael> best trainer is Red
<otakon> CheesyLlama13: Ash yes
<CheesyLlama13> Yay I remembered something for once~ :D
<otakon> ValtheJean: so when does Scootaloo evolve into a chicken?
<CheesyLlama13> Must be soon...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 implying this isn't my first playthrough of this game
<otakon> So no one answered my question so I'll post it again.
<otakon> GUYS! I HAVE A QUESTION! Should a game be counted on it's merits of single player gameplay over all else?
<Michael> you dont have a savegame? ValtheJean
<otakon> Michael: proabably multiple
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: better idea, go outside and enjoy the real world
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I installed it today for the stream
<ValtheJean> 2,14 otherwise, I've never had it
<otakon> Saturn: nah, graphics are fantastic but the XP is lousy.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Serenity> Saturn: You mean the same world full of buggery witchcraft bugger?
<Michael> btw, are u using VBA?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 god damn fucking bullshit crits
<otakon> Saturn: how you been ya crazy scot? good I hope
<Serenity> As you probably noticed, it's kinda dangerous around my district
<Chrysalis> otakon graphics outside are terrible
<otakon> and down for the count
<Chrysalis> always raining
<otakon> Chrysalis: but the bloom effects!
<alexxm> oh dear
<Chrysalis> buck bloom
<Shizuka> 13Saturn: Outside is so overrated
<Chrysalis> buck godrays
<Serenity> Chrysalis: Outsides have got epic looking water reflections
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: Amen.
<Shizuka> 13only one shard, you get one character
<Chrysalis> and buck DoF
<Shizuka> 13permadeath
<Chrysalis> Shizuka no check points
<ValtheJean> 2,14 WHAT THE FUCK IS WITH THESE CRITS?
<Shizuka> 13you have to stop playing every 24 hours or you die, but you're expected to play forever
<Meanwhile> Not if you roll Hindu Shizu.
<Serenity> Sucks that according to my fortune teller, I' living to 53, then I get shot.
<Michael> do it!
<Shizuka> 13but you don't get to pick your class
<Serenity> Nice future I have there
<TheMaster> ponymon?
<Shizuka> 13your class is built from the other players on the server
<Michael> yes TheMaster
<Chrysalis> how do you actually get black mesa on steam
<Serenity> Shizuka: You can't pick player name either
<Shizuka> 13you can change it later if you navigate the admin's stupidly complex rules
<TheMaster> arte there really 150 ponies?
<TheMaster> are there*
<Michael> yes
<CheesyLlama13> I've got to go :'(
<Serenity> True, but don't you have to be a certain age?
<Michael> 151 i think
<CheesyLlama13> I'll see y'all later ^^
<AJIsAwesome> bye CheesyLlama13
<CheesyLlama13> byee
<Michael> bye CheesyLlama13
<Serenity> Right
<Serenity> Some zambies want to kill me, so I'm gonna get some sleep and murder them
<Serenity> See ya tommorow if I don't get eaten
<Meanwhile> >Zombies want to kill you
<Meanwhile> >Go to sleep
<Meanwhile> Well that seems counter productive at best.
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Serenity :)
<Serenity> ^ Yep
<otakon1> Shizuka: okay how about your view on this: A game should be able to stand on it's single player merits regardless of the multi-player added to it.
<Michael> Gnight Serenity
<otakon1> night Serenity sleep well
<Rainbowdash90> whoose streaming
<Shizuka> 13i generally can't stand multiplayer
<Meanwhile> otakon are you STILL banging on about that?
<Shizuka> 13so yes
<otakon1> Rainbowdash90: Val is
<Chrysalis> otakon1 but what about games like tf2
<otakon1> Chrysalis: don't count since they are nothing but MP
<otakon1> Chrysalis: I'm talking stuff like mass effect 3 or Cod titles
<otakon1> stuff with MP and SP modes
<Michael> Gnight y'all

<ShadowQuill> THIS IS EVERYTHING
<Litwick> hey guys ^^
<Ihop1> hey
<alexxm> how are things Litwick
<AJIsAwesome> hi Litwick
<ShadowQuill> MY CELESTIA THIS IS AMAZING
<Litwick> Doing well Alex.
<Pearly> hey everypony
<Ihop1> why is he only staying in one spot
<alexxm> how are things Pearly
<AJIsAwesome> hi Pearly :)
<Ihop1> hey
<AJIsAwesome> Ihop1: He's level grinding.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Ihop1: first rule of pokemon: train your starters and first catches to level 10
<ShadowQuill> Lyra
<ValtheJean> 2,14 otherwise the world hurts you
<prince-dari> Bitch please
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: i never bothered with it and i beat the games easily
<prince-dari> Only use your first pokemon till it's level 100
<Litwick> guys
<prince-dari> And never use anything else
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: ^
<Litwick> help me.
<prince-dari> And win the game
<prince-dari> :P
<Pearly> Hey alexxm and AJIsAwesome, how are you dears doing?
<Litwick> im reading homestuck and cant sto[p
<AJIsAwesome> With what?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's the boring 4 year old way to play
<alexxm> i'm good Pearly yuo
<prince-dari> Lul
<shibaru> I hate when the phone rings and I can't find it and it stops ringing the second I find it -__-
<AJIsAwesome> Pearly: Good. How about you? :)
<twilight_sprinkle> it is a fast way though
<twilight_sprinkle> plus
<shibaru> It was probably Gen
<prince-dari> I'm sure Val would love to slap the shit out of you for that Litwick
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont see the point of leveling pokemon you can catch later at 40 anyway
<Litwick> Why? Val hates Homestuck?
<Litwick> Meh, it's his opinion.
<Pearly> I am good, had my surgery and it went well... just my hand and elbow is bandaged
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because if you catch them at early levels their EVs aren't at 0 when they're 40
<Ihop1> prince-dari: thats been a tradition for every pokemon game since i as 5
<TheMaster> if you catch them early they have better stat progression then if you catch the later
<Nittany_Discord> Five.
<TheMaster> the game, like all jrpgs, rewards grinding
<Nittany_Discord> Pearly: What surgery?
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: i forget whats EV? some stat from leveling? i mean its not reeally important for the games that didnt have multiplayer, since the stats arent needed that much to beat the game anyway
<Saturn> 08,01a pair of my friends just broke up their engagement :(
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<Saturn> 08,01which really sucked, because they were an adorable couple
<alexxm> sorry to hear that Saturn
<ValtheJean> 2,14 every time you beat a pokemon, it rewards an EV of a certain stat
<Pearly> I had carpal and cubital tunnel release surgery
<Saturn> 08,01but on the plus side... the guy is really fucking hot... but straight
<ValtheJean> 2,14 4 EVs of one type equate to 1 actual stat by level 100
<Saturn> 08,01but now i don't feel bad about hitting on him when i see him next!
<Saturn> 08,01oh wait, right, boyfriend...
<Chrysalis> oh Saturn
<AJIsAwesome> Oh you. :P
<Chrysalis> really, a post-engagement rebound?
<Cades> lol
<Ihop1> poor saturn
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: so you can get a godlike pokemon just by beating a billion level 3's?
<Saturn> 08,01still, a bit of harmless flirting is fine
<Pearly> haha Saturn

<otakon1> ValtheJean: haven't you caught all of them in the area yet?
<otakon1> SPEED UP!
<weeping_pegasi82> but it's a little hard to control the thing
<Nick> hi mystic
<otakon1> lol
<Kandarihu|OldComp> ValtheJean, as far as we're all concerned, you were afk until you talk.
<Alchemist> gotta go fast
<otakon> he's lost control!
<Kandarihu|OldComp> It's the way it is with everypony
<MysticLugia> 12hi Nick, I hope you enjoyed the part of the stream you saw l3
<Ponyloverforever> brb
<Mozdoc> So the streamer is just grinding now?
<Saturn> 08,01yes, thank you Facebook for brinigng me face to face with my ex and her new fiance...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, why do you even have facebook
<Saturn> 08,01in ridiculously photogenic photos
<GilDash> One of many future-potential problems I avoid by never checking in on Facebook. :S
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: because BUCK
<CrimsonPhoenix> oooh
<Saturn> 08,01i actually got rid of my facebook account before i started BUCK
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....ah
<Alchemist> GilDash: I think ahead and not even make an FB account :D
<Pink3> Where can i get this game???
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, yeah, i look at them, and most of what i feel is seething hatred for my ex

<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, how did it end?
<Saturn> 08,01CrimsonPhoenix: angrily
<Ihop1> >haveing facebook
<Dark_Horst> Pink3: you'll need an emulator, look for visual boy advance

<drf|work> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/13/4Vnae9BbskmhIAv35BYhPg2.png
<GilDash> Alchemist: Need it for my friends. That said, it's impossiblt to get them to do anything without ringing them, so it's still little more then a middle man.
<otakon> Pink3: and IPS Patcher for the mod as well
<twilight_sprinkle> facebook>twitter
<Pink3> ok
<Dark_Horst> otakon: what'S that now?
<weeping_pegasi82> diamond tiara is overpowered in this:|

<weeping_pegasi82> yah

<Kandarihu|OldComp> CrimsonPhoenix, good question. I'll try it out when my mom brings her laptop back
<Alchemist> GilDash: I can see how it can be used, but I dont maintain contact with that many people. I have an email for those who I dont call friends just collegues/else and I have a phone number for my friends. I dont need more.
<Saturn> 08,01actually, come to think of it, i hhave friends who work at facebook, google, and microsoft
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, Good gosh
<weeping_pegasi82> the possibilitys
<Saturn> 08,01when i graduate, i should pester them to put in a good word for me
<GilDash> Alchemist: Same boat as me, basically. Still, pays to have other ways to get in touch sometimes.

<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: that would be an awesome idea for a game
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: How could you get that wrong? :(
<otakon> I got the them confused
<otakon> bc I don't WATCH Code Geass
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/NC4tZ.png he needs his own game
<Reikim|Crowbar> ...Code Geass.
*twilight_sprinkle slaps otakon again
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Why not? :(
<Reikim|Crowbar> Whelp, now returning to stream.
<CCCP> i wanna watch you bleed :I
<Reikim|Crowbar> Shizuka: Game of the Year, right there.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: y u no watch best anime of all time???
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: bc I don't.. I honestly have no interest in it I am turned off by the artstyle
<TheRandomkid321> I hate anime...
<otakon> super stick people
<SirGanjalf> Shizuka: Snarks are so cute you get an achievement just for letting them kill you.
<weeping_pegasi82> go zecora!
<Bronysith> im going for a very enthusiastic walk through the woods
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: It's alright. You dont have to. :D
<Soital> 12EW
<Dark_Horst> fuck
<Reikim|Crowbar> Code Geass...art style by Clamp, right?
<otakon> SirGanjalf: are that what the little sonic dogs are called?
<Soital> 12EARWIGS
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: have fun, dont die!
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Bring $20 with you.
<weeping_pegasi82> TheRandomKid321: may I ask why?
<Reikim|Crowbar> CLAMP's art amuses me.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol AJIsAwesome :D
<otakon> Reikim|Crowbar: pretty sure, super elongated bodies with no room for organs
<Shizuka> 13those are houndeyes
<otakon> oh
<SirGanjalf> ^oh right
<otakon> Well I find Houndeyes cute
<Dark_Horst> that old guy in the second city who wants to teach you how to catch things? dont talk to him. there wondt be a checkbox, and your game wil freeze
<Reikim|Crowbar> otakon: Actually, yes, it was! CLAMP did the designs for Code Geass. But not the mecha designs, which is my personal favourite part of the anime.
<otakon> at least the little noises they make
<Dark_Horst> thing is, now i cant move anymore and start over
<SirGanjalf> and the acid spitting alligators(?) are bullsquids
<Reikim|Crowbar> Also: COLOURS. One of the best openings of all time. NO EXCEPTIONS.
<TheRandomkid321> weeping_pegasi82 I have seen what it can do to people. I aint turning into one of those freaks alright?
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|Crowbar: ikr
<otakon> Reikim|Crowbar: and the mecha are unneeded in it if you ask me
<SirGanjalf> huh huh, "bullsquid":P
<twilight_sprinkle> Reikim|Crowbar: its only fitting that thte best anime anime gets the best opening :P
<otakon> Reikim|Crowbar: ahem TTGL would like a word with you
<thelonepony> http://derpibooru.org/72356?scope=scpe830f48deeccc495532ee5c58d054b34233cd763f
<weeping_pegasi82> TheRandomkid321: hey I have no problem with that
<Reikim|Crowbar> otakon: Sure they're not needed. But they're bloody awesome and if you disagree the Lancelot will cleave you in half.
<otakon> maybe
<otakon> but he's a 2D figure and I'm not
<otakon> :P
<sub06905> ello everypony :)
<Reikim|Crowbar> otakon: Saying the mecha aren't necessary is like saying the mecha in TTGL aren't necessary. Try saying that to Simon's face.
<otakon> wb sub06905
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy sub06905.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, sub06905 :)
<TheRandomkid321> I don't wish to turn into one of those people who's life revolves around anime and wear anime costumes around. Okay. End of story.
<weeping_pegasi82> hey sub06905
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: what if you are, but you just think youre in 3d?
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi sub06905
<otakon> Reikim|Crowbar: now THAT is a different story since the mecha of TTGL is a major plot element
<Reikim|Crowbar> TheRandomkid321: If you do it's only your fault.
<sub06905> so who is treaming ponymon?
<sub06905> streaming*
<otakon> Reikim|Crowbar: unlike the unnecessary "Knightmare" of CG

<otakon> sub06905: ValtheJean with Ponymon
<Everlasting_Joy> I love seeing them bounce at high speeds.
<Sumica> 00,10aw how cute, colt bigmac
<Nick> I know >< horrible
<TheRandomkid321> I had a friend who got so obsessed with anime he changed.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: the mecha technology of britannia was what gave them the chance to attack the world
<sub06905> dat scootaloo <3
<alexxm> how've you been sub06905
<Reikim|Crowbar> otakon: The mecha of Code Geass are also important. The Holy Brittanian Empire could not have existed sans Knightmare Frames. And if you look at it a certain way, TTGL could have worked without mecha. You could have replaced them with personal power and the story would have worked.
<sub06905> ive been good alexxm, you?
<alexxm> i'm good sub06905

<CrimsonPhoenix> Kirby's Dream Collection comes with three full episode of Kirby Right Back At Ya
<Dark_Horst> twilight, pinkie and rainbow dash
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: not in this version
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Is the sub available in the game?
<twilight_sprinkle> in this version its fluttershy, rarirt and aj
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: which version is it?
<twilight_sprinkle> val took aj
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, it's only the dubs unfortunately
<TheRandomkid321> Dark_Horst How?
<AJIsAwesome> :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> but it's hilarious for me
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: idk, im not aware of the versions, but he had different starter options
<weeping_pegasi82> Everlastin_Joy: in Dawn RD, PP, and TS and in Dusk AJ, R, and FS
<Everlasting_Joy> weeping_pegasi82: Thanks :).
<Dark_Horst> TheRandomkid321: talked to him, them my game just stopped didnt freeze or anything, the clock is still running. but i cant move anymore. had to start over
<weeping_pegasi82> no prob

<Everlasting_Joy> Big Mac just kicked Applebloom. What a game.
<weeping_pegasi82> guess what
<CCCP> soo much violence :( the poor ponies
<Everlasting_Joy> weeping_pegasi82: What?
<weeping_pegasi82> Zecora can use Scary Face

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Everlasting_Joy: Big Mac beatin' those eggs like he beats applebloom *thats from epic pie time*
<weeping_pegasi82> it just makes sense
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Everlasting_Joy> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Oi.
<weeping_pegasi82> and RD can use Dash what a surprise
<Dark_Horst> well, must be an older version
<Everlasting_Joy> And seapony Lyra wants to see what's going on.
<Dark_Horst> the latest, 0.32, has rainbow, pinkie and twilight as starters
<Reikim|Crowbar> Using Dash, while providing a temporary increase in combat abilities, is extremely dangerous and could easily result in fatality.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i hope Fancy Pants is a legendary in this lol
<Reikim|Crowbar> Don't do Dash, kids.
<weeping_pegasi82> have you thought about pokemon this way?

<weeping_pegasi82> Sketch_Toku_Brony: interesting...
<otakon> Everlasting_Joy: Drowsee that's it, God it's been so long

<weeping_pegasi82> torchic
<Bunny_Striker> otakon: that flaming chicken thing
<Glacymr> i wonder if there is something funky going on with my graphics card on my other laptop
<otakon> Obsidian: and that's Scootaloo
<otakon> Torchic
<otakon> Torscootaloo
<Glacymr> the text gets all slightly blurry and boldy for a few seconds then turns clear and crisp for a few seconds and so forward

<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Yep. :P
<Eddmario> Counting your starter, you could only get 4 or 5 pokemon before the first gym, and that's in the remakes
<thelonepony> Carrot top!
<Eddmario> In the original it was 3
<Caramel> 2,14 Spearow, Pidgey, Rattata, the Bugs, Pikachu and the nidorans
<Caramel> 2,14 I think a "Bitch please" is in order
<Bronysith> http://imgur.com/Fer2v
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03dragonforce?
<Bronysith> i have some stuff to set on fire
<Bronysith> i must set stuff on fire or the voices go crazy
<Dark92Enigma> My stream isn't showing
<Dark92Enigma> NOW IT DOES!
<Eddmario> SPearow can't be gotten til after you get the first gym badg,e, as where you can catch it is blocked by that douche who wants you to do the first gym, you can only get the nidos of a certain gender, and pikachu wasn't in viridian forest in the originals
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: set the voices on fire
<Caramel> 2,14 false
<ShiningDawn> hai guys
*Bronysith sets twilight_sprinkle on fire
<Dark92Enigma> I NEED THIS GAME
<Bronysith> done
<Caramel> 2,14 Spearow is in the place to the left of the pokecenter
<Caramel> 2,14 before your rival battle
<Dark92Enigma> WANT IT, NEED IT
<AJIsAwesome> hi ShiningDawn
*twilight_sprinkle hugs Bronysith and ignites him
<Reikim|Crowbar> I always got Spearow before the first gym.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i have a flame retardant suit dumbass
<Reikim> Why? Fearow is a badass bird of prey, what more do you want?
<Eddmario> Going to the path to the Elite Four doesn't count...
<weeping_pegasi82> hey ShiningDawn
*Ponies47 Sets Bronysith on fire
<Reikim> How?
<Reikim> How does it not count, Edd?
<Caramel> 2,14 uh, yes it does
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: i made a hole in it while i was hugging you
<Bronysith> Ponies47: what part of flame retardant suit do you not understand
<Reikim> You can get there before first gym.
<Caramel> 2,14 why else do they throw in a level appropriate encounter?
<Reikim> Hell, I got myself a Mankey there.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: you cant, cause i have the force
<Dark92Enigma> BOOOOOOOO Diamond Tiara
<oni_link> Eddmario: Spearow, Nidoran M/F, Mankey, Pidgey, Caterpie, Weedle, and Pikachu are what you can get before the first badge
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: but so do i
<AJIsAwesome> Yeah, that's where I got my Mankey.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: nope
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: yep
<otakon> um
<otakon> is DT crying?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: you are now thinking about naked otakon
*Ponies47 keeps trying to set Bronysith an fire and then notices the suit "Oh......right"

<weeping_pegasi82> die diamond tiara!
<prince-dari> and pikachu wasn't in viridian forest in the originals
<prince-dari> Yes it was
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Hmm......I think you're right. :O
<prince-dari> I was playing Pokemon Blue on my gameboy the other day
<prince-dari> And caught pikachu in the viridian forest
<otakon> nice
<Reikim> Nice catch.
<Reikim> Also, to add to this list: you can catch a Pidgeotto in Viridian, with enough pateince.
<Reikim> *patience
<dynamo2814> okay serious question time
<Dark92Enigma> prince-dari: Lucky you :)
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: One of my earliest encounters was a pidgeotto. :$
<prince-dari> Dark92Enigma: No really, it was some crazy luck
<oni_link> Reikim: Ive only caught one twice the entire time I've been playing... I STILL play it.
<prince-dari> I walked through the whole of the forest
<Dark92Enigma> Patience Robin......---Slade
<dynamo2814> my mom has been acceptting but unliking of me being a brony
<prince-dari> Without a single encounter
<prince-dari> Then right at the end I got one
<Dark92Enigma> oh
<prince-dari> And it was a pikachu
<prince-dari> My friend had to walk up and down there for about 30 miuntes to get one
<dynamo2814> that being said she has finally agreed to watch an episode with me
<Ihop1> big deal dari i caught a pikachu within five minets of starting pokemon yellow
<prince-dari> XD
<oni_link> Pikachu is wayyy easier to find than I Pidgeotto in the Viridan forest...
<AJIsAwesome> Ihop1: :D
<dynamo2814> which one should i show her to make the best first impression?
<oni_link> *A
<Reikim> I had Yellow, so I started with a Pikachu. Suck it.
<AJIsAwesome> dynamo2814: What is your mom like in terms of personality?
<dynamo2814> calmer version of pinkie
<oni_link> Reikim: You also got all the starters. Youre spoiled :/
<AJIsAwesome> dynamo2814: Try showing her some episode that she can relate to.
<Reikim> Damn straight.
<Dark92Enigma> prince-dari: it's nearly impossible to go through the forest without getting a encounter
<Caramel> 2,14 pffff, you can find pikachu's in viridian forest, all yellow trainers should trade it for badass Rattatas :P
<weeping_pegasi82> dynamo2814: hmmm... maybe luna eclipsed or... um... party of one or a friend in deed
<Reikim> My Charizard wrecked. Shit.
<Dovah> uh what is going on with my stream?
<Dark92Enigma> prince-dari: *with some other pokemon
*sub06905 got a shiny totadile at the start of HG :$
<oni_link> Reikim: Fire team, Master Race
<prince-dari> I know
<Dovah> its buffering... but its still playing....
<weeping_pegasi82> Dovah: refresh
<Reikim> And my Blastoise tanked shit.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dovah: then the end is neigh
<Dark92Enigma> prince-dari: OK, another question.....what would be the equivalent of Pikachu in this game <------
<prince-dari> There's also only a 5% chance of a pikachu encounter in the last bit of grass at Viridian forest
<Reikim> And my Venusaur...sat in the box and did jack all.
<prince-dari> So that just makes it all the less likely
<Pink3> I got the bronystate playlist:$
<Dovah> twilight_sprinkle: :O i see what u did there :|
<Dark92Enigma> dayum
<CCCP> prince-dari how do you know this?
<sub06905> rarity :P
<prince-dari> But it did happen, well if you believe I'm not bullshitting
<oni_link> Reikim: :D No love for grass types
<dynamo2814> think i mght try luna she might like her.
<Pink3> I got the bronystate playlist :)
<Pink3> :$
<prince-dari> CCCP: You can look up encounter percentages on the internet, but a friend told me
<Dark92Enigma> prince-dari: i believe you, bro
<weeping_pegasi82> CCCP: easy, serebii.net
<oni_link> ^
<CCCP> oh
<AJIsAwesome> dynamo2814: Try that one.
<oni_link> best pokemon resource is serebii
<Reikim> On the other hand, my Primape kicked ass, my Dugtrio threw rocks and caused earthquakes, and my Weepinbell was broken as fuck.
<oni_link> Reikim: broken how? XD
<otakon> prince-dari: I remember I looked for a Pikachu in Viridian in my version before
<prince-dari> Did it take a while?
<AJIsAwesome> dynamo2814: IF she likes villain, show her Return Of Harmony.
<otakon> Reikim: Gyrados, Hyper Beam. Enough said
<CCCP> bye bye everyone
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Weepinbell? No Victreebell?
<otakon> bye CCCP take care
<sub06905> bai CCCP
<weeping_pegasi82> bye CCCP
<oni_link> Bye CCCP
<Dark92Enigma> bye CCCP
<Reikim> How could Weepinbell NOT be broken? Sleep Powder owns everything! I tanked my entire rival battle with Sleep Powder, Razor Leaf and Acid!
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, CCCP :)
<thelonepony> bye CCCP
<dynamo2814> i would but she only agreed to thirty minutes so :(
<oni_link> Reikim: I never used one TBH, I overlooked grass types
<Obsidian> See ya CCCP
<otakon> dammit now I want to play Pokemon again
<prince-dari> I also did some glitch to get Mew on my Blue cartridge. <:
<sub06905> ^
<oni_link> otakon: Do IT!
<Caramel> 2,14 Dari: the abra glitch?
<weeping_pegasi82> Caramel: might I suggest just hyper training?
<prince-dari> Yeah
<otakon> oni_link: I shall download it to my tablet
<Reikim> Grass types kicked ass in G1. Anything that could cause sleep kicked ass.
<prince-dari> At the nugget path
<sub06905> but i did it on Red :>
<prince-dari> bridge
<oni_link> otakon: is it android based?
<Dark92Enigma> otakon: SAME HERE! if only i could have an EMULATOR
<Obsidian> Anypony here do theMissingno glitch?
<otakon> oni_link: eeyup I love it
<weeping_pegasi82> not unless it broke your game
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: get it for PC
<oni_link> otakon: Get droidemulite
<Ihop1> victrybell is best pokemon wiyh golem
<Reikim> otakon: I see your Flying/Water and I hit it with a quick Thunder from my Pikachu. DIE SEA DRAGON DIE.
<dynamo2814> ok so a couple of days ago i saw that the las pegasus convention will be feb. 22 next year.....and i thought to myself that is the day after my birthday.....BEST PRESENT EVER!
<oni_link> Obsidian: I did just to mess around with it. I saw level 256 Pokemon D:
<AJIsAwesome> dynamo2814: Okay. Also, try Lesson Zero.
<Dark92Enigma> prince-dari: you know more about the secrets of the game than i do
<otakon> Reikim: it never happened in my game but I never fought a human opponent, However when that happened I just used Graveler
<otakon> I loved Graveler
<otakon> I wanted a Golem forever but never could find someone with a another copy
<oni_link> Graveler>Golem
<Dark92Enigma> otakon: same with Ponymon? also, no virus involved? last time i had a virus, my computer crashed
<Ihop1> gravler was a bro
<weeping_pegasi82> Dynamo2814: which episode did you choose?
<oni_link> ^
<dynamo2814> my video frose
<dynamo2814> froze*
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: yeah it just depends where you got yours from
<otakon> dynamo2814: refresh
<Reikim> otakon: Weepinbell puts it to sleep and violates it with tentacles. That or Dugtrio buries you under a continent. Or Mankey karate-chops you into little bits. Your choice, really.
<dynamo2814> froze*
<pony_4733> What is this now?
<prince-dari> Dark92Enigma: My name is also some of the random characters in certain positions so I can catch pokemon with the ghost sprite from Lavender town
<otakon> Reikim: Hyper Beam kills you inone hit
<weeping_pegasi82> ponymon!!
<Ponies47> pony_4733: Ponymon
<otakon> Reikim: 99% of the time
<pony_4733> K, what's that?
<Ponies47> pony_4733: Pokemon but with ponies
<otakon> pony_4733: a mod hack for the GBA Pokemon games that let you catch MLP ponies instead
<oni_link> prince-dari: you caught the ghost??
<weeping_pegasi82> otakon: I have to disagree with you on that one
<Dark92Enigma> otakon where did i get my virus? Oh, you mean the game? No, i played it via game-boy emulator
<Reikim> otakon: Pikachu out-speeds you with Thunder. So does Dugtrio with Earthquake. So does Mankey with a fist to the face. So does Weepinbell with Sleep Powder. So does- I could go all day.
<Meanwhile> Your pony has no socks! what's wrong with you.
<Dark92Enigma> otakon i got the virus from a free-manga page
<pony_4733> Hmmm, doesn't seem like ti would have much variety.
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: :D
<oni_link> Reikim: G1 is best generation for PKMN
<prince-dari> Well not THE ghost in the tower, just a pokemon with the same sprite as that
<otakon> Reikim: Flying are immune to Earthquake and I even used him to beat electric types
<oni_link> prince-dari: oh cool
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: odd
<sub06905> dat dash
<otakon> She's so fluffy
<Reikim> otakon: Obviously you never met THIS Pikachu. Besides, can't beam shit if you're asleep.
<weeping_pegasi82> Rainbow dash used dash... what a surprise
<Dark92Enigma> otakon do you have it for pc?
<otakon> Reikim: yeah well my Gyrados was fast enough to beat out any competition. God I miss that big fish.
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/ik97w.jpg
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: yeah, go to CoolRom.com for the emulators
<oni_link> weeping_pegasi82: dash,dash,rainbow,dash dash
<Dovah> lol on omegle i was in spy mode and asked a question completly unrealated to mlp and the first thing anyone did was post a picture of rd then leave :D

<oni_link> Bronysith: wtf :D
<Reikim> otakon: Yeah...And I miss my Charizard. Badass dragon. Ruled the skies. Could beat up the rock-type E4 with Flamethrower...man G1 was great, wasn't it.
<Dark92Enigma> otakon sorry if i'm too picky.....no virus?
<otakon> Reikim: agreed
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: no virus, my goto site for emulating
<Reikim> G2 was still best G, though.
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/H39VN.jpg
<Bronysith> i liked G3 pokemon
<Reikim> Dark92Enigma: Don't listen to him, use DopeRoms. Best emulation site.
<oni_link> Reikim: Yeah me too. That feeling and the feeling of beating Brock with a wee little Charmander and Ember was great too
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: FINALLY, I found someone who likes Gen 3.
<otakon> and done
<weeping_pegasi82> I like all of the generations
<sub06905> Gen 3? <3

<HyperMetalLugia> 13 was okay, but > Cinnamon beta rage and GTK issues
<oni_link> Fire Pokemon FTW.

<prince-dari> supperborny
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: Oh, like the Nostalgia Critic?.......i still don't care, i love that movie.......sure it isn't a Masterpiece like ''Who framed Roger Rabbit'?'' and it was more childish and commercial, but it's still enjoyable

<Freefall29> Ponies47: you're a coward, let me do it.
<twilight_sprinkle> tbh a lot of the old CN cartoons like cow and chicken annoyed the hell out of me, i only really liked dexters lab and powerpuff girls iirc. id say theres about as many good cartoons today

<JESmith71> Dark92Enigma: This is what Doug said about LT Show Lola:
<JESmith71> Dark92Enigma: ""How did they turn Lola Bunny, the most bland and unfunny of Looney Tunes, into one of the most hilariously awkward psychopaths in recent memory? Maybe it's Kristen Wiig's voice, maybe it's just great writing, but she kills me. The image of her smiling in the rain is one of the funniest visuals I've seen in awhile."
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: Remember Robot Chicken?

<Sumica> 00,10tis what I get trying to type and eat dinner at the same time
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: Robot Chicken had the same non-sequitur formula as MAD, but unlike the latter, they were actually doing twisted things to the shows they were referencing.
<Shizuka> 13somepony called for a victory screech and was NOT rewarded with a proper victory screech?
<oni_link> nerf_soldier: me too for a moment

<JESmith71> Space Jam was B last time it played here
<dynamo2814> i hope we see more luna in season 3....and maybe some succes in the CMC
<Sumica> 00,10ah that would be why, never realy liked spongebob enough to watch it more then in passing
<weeping_pegasi82> it's fixed
<twilight_sprinkle> dynamo2814: CMC will never succeed, theyll be locked in eternal torture like tom with jerry
<Bronysith> what we need in season 3 priority is an applejack song
<Sumica> 00,10I want a scootaloo ep
<sub06905> ^
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: YES!
<Ihop1> post movie spoongebob is best spoongebob
<RAWRity> Scootaloo will never get an episode.
<weeping_pegasi82> APPLEJACK SONG
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: BACK to Robot Chicken vs. MAD.......let's make an example: Spongebob
<AJIsAwesome> AJ SONG MUST HAPPEN
<Skylands> !puellamagi
<oni_link> NEEDS MORE RARITY AND PINKIE
<weeping_pegasi82> say yay if you agree
<Dark92Enigma> APPLEJACK SONG NEEDED
<dynamo2814> haha i wonder what would happen if a pony never got their mark what would society think of them...
<twilight_sprinkle> i will lmao if AJ doesnt get a song in the 3rd season
<BlueFlare> Skylands, you are 131Homura Akemi.
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: MAD is a disgrace.
<Freefall29> Bronysith: yeah..... they're giving spike singing lines, they gotta give applejack a song for sure now
<RAWRity> Season 3 Prediction: Luna Fanboys will piss and moan every time Luna isn't in an episode.
<Princess> Hello
<oni_link> I will be back later. I have to go home now :P See ya all in a bit
<AJIsAwesome> If SPIKE IS SINGING in season 3, AJ MUST have her own song in season 3.
<weeping_pegasi82> hey princess
<LadyCanary> Oh my...what is this? :o
<AJIsAwesome> ohai LadyCanary
<RAWRity> LadyCanary!!!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> what we need to do is take some of the fluttershy screen time, and push it somewhere else (to rarity and aj)
<weeping_pegasi82> ponymon :$
<Sumica> 00,10LadyCanary <3
<JESmith71> LadyCanary: Ponymon, a Pokemon pony hack
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: check out the two leaked songs on youtube... he's singing in both of them.
<LadyCanary> Hiya RAWRity ^_^ Hi Sumica! Hi all~
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You know just so I'm not making a ass of my self, what do Desktop computers have over laptops?
<weeping_pegasi82> hey LadyCanary
<AJIsAwesome> Freefall29: Already have.
<prince-dari> Dat LadyCanary. o:
<LadyCanary> Dat prince-dari :3
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], better performance for the dollar.
<prince-dari> Hello. <:
<Sumica> 00,10upgradeable SpadeMagnes[R]
<sub06905> suddenly LadyCanary
<kidzrul434> why are they just going back and forth
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So would it be worth getting a desktop instead of a laptop?
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[R]: upgradeable, usually have better specs for price, allow for larger monitors, not required to use a premade keyboard.
<Princess> .
<LadyCanary> Who is streaming btw?
<Ponies47> LadyCanary: Caramel
<LadyCanary> This mod intrigues me.
<Skylands> 10!puellamagi
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], if portability isn't a concern, absolutely
<LadyCanary> Ahhhh.
<BlueFlare|Away> Skylands, you are 114Kyoko Sakura.
<prince-dari> Val is
<Sumica> 00,10desktops tend to have better preformace as well
<Skylands> 10:
<Yahooz> With the Pokemans
<Skylands> 10:3
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[R]: depends. If you don't need the mobility, I'd go for the Desktop over a lappy.
<Ponies47> Also hi LadyCanary
<dynamo2814> spade magnes more speed
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I dont intend of taking a computer out of the house
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: What Robot Chicken would do with Spongebob, is to make him have a son WITH SANDY of all people (shocking, but funny) what.....that OTHER SHOW would do is steal Spongebob, and say ''oh there it is''. All in all, fuck that other show
<JESmith71> You know one of the MLP forums I'm on is doing a game for Season 3. Like you try to guess what may happen in the episode when it airs and if you're right you get points, and at the end of the season they'll give prizes
<Kandarihu> Gaming laptops are absurdly expensive.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I got my dad to decide to get me a desktop instead
<prince-dari> Yahooz: Pokemans hacker
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[R]: then yeah, Desktop's preferable IMO
<weeping_pegasi82> tms don't work yet
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He had the most bullshit reason for saying no to me at first
<Yahooz> prince-dari: not until we get Steven in here im not
<SpadeMagnes[R]> "Because you can't move it"
<Pink3> IM GETTING XBOX NEXT WEEK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D

<prince-dari> Lul

<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: :S
<Yahooz> but then again, spare the chat for once
<weeping_pegasi82> Pink3: congrats

<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Bronysith> Shizuka: shes on skype...
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka EEEEEEEEYUP
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], are you eyeing a prebuilt system or what?
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[R]: for some, moving it around is important. I have to have a laptop atm because I use it at school for my classes.
<Yahooz> Canary is everywhere
<prince-dari> Custom is cheaper than prebuild
<prince-dari> prebuilt*
<LadyCanary> :D Hi Shizu Shizu~
<prince-dari> If you can be bothered to put it all together yourself
<Shizuka> 13canary canary <3
<LadyCanary> ^o^
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well I doubt I have the skills to do so
<drfsupercenter> 03:4
<SpadeMagnes[R]> or the cash...
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6583755008
<DashWithRainbows> prince-dari or get a friend to do it.
<Yahooz> or hack custom shit
<Skylands> 105678910
<Sumica> 00,10what's always amusising Dari is when people say it's hard to build a computer
<RAWRity> prince-dari has a point. if you have a friend or family member who knows their way around hardware, you might want to ask them to help order parts for a custom build.
<Kandarihu> http://tinyurl.com/falconguide Here's a good guide for picking parts for a custom PC.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I lack that..so...
<prince-dari> Yeah, it isn't that hard, you can pretty much just get an eHow article or some shit to tell you what to do
<Yahooz> hell yeah, lets customize this bitch
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Beside I would probably break something :(
<Freefall29> Kandarihu: wow.... now even a child can burn a computer. thanks man
<Princess_Cadence> .
<RAWRity> Sumica: it's not necessarily hard, you just have to know what you're doing. however, most people don't really know all that much about a computer outside of turning it on and surfing the internet.
<BileGraze> Hi, peeps.
<prince-dari> Yahooz: Is that from epic...something time?
<weeping_pegasi82> I can't facepalm properly because of these stupid glasses
<BileGraze> Does anyone here know of a good metal PMV?
<Princess_Cadence> whats on stream tonight?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I know how to work a computer well but trying to build one? I have no chance in hell
<Yahooz> prince-dari: Epic Custom time
<Yahooz> copyright CustomState 2012
<Freefall29> Princess_Cadence: ponies?
<prince-dari> Ponies are never on stream
<prince-dari> Lies
<Sumica> 00,10true RAWRity, but the actaly assembly is realy easy if you just look at the bits
<AJIsAwesome> Ew, Ponies. :|
<BileGraze> Anyone at all...
<Princess_Cadence> looks like pokemon if you ask me
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'm going to go with a pre built because I have no job
<sub06905> ponies are forbidden, unless its G3
<Sumica> 00,10you cant put it together wrong unless you use a hammer.
<weeping_pegasi82> hi BileGraze
<BileGraze> Hi, friend.
<Yahooz> >Ponies
<JESmith71> Only 10 more levels until she's grown Derpy
<Yahooz> >Gen 4
<Yahooz> HA
<RAWRity> Sumica: true. Worst part of assembling most custom builds is just cable management.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I MAY consider getting parts for it if I ever get a job
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6588985088
<Freefall29> Sumica: and if you fail at that... grab some duck tape.
<BileGraze> Do you know any good metal PMV's?
<RAWRity> fucking cable management...
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], it's quite user friendly nowadays. Look up videos on the internet for it. You will get a lot more upgradability with a custom-built PC than with a prebuilt.
<RAWRity> SO. MANY. ZIP TIES.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Whats cable management?
<BileGraze> Wait, how do I respond to people?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I doubt my dad would let me build my own computer
<prince-dari> BileGraze: What do you mean?
<Sumica> 00,10most my cables have that mesh shrinkwrap on it already
<Dark92Enigma> By the way.........we should have Nostalgia Critic's review of Space Jam this friday!
<weeping_pegasi82> BileGraze: Smile like you mean it is rock but it's good all the same
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[R]: cable management is basically tying all the various cables togetther and keeping them out of the way of parts, the fan, the airflow, heatsinks etc
<BileGraze> Who ever just responded to me, type it agian, I glitched out for a couple seconds.
<Sumica> 00,10I even did that back with my IDE cables. pilled them apart so I could have a cable bundle rather then a ribon
<SpadeMagnes[R]> RAWRity: Yea..see I would be horrible at that shit
<Princess_Cadence> hmm ill be back all washroom break
<BileGraze> @Princess_Cadence Hi.
<BileGraze> How I do it? D:
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6588966144
<SpadeMagnes[R]> But at least I know now that Desktops are worth it
<Sumica> 00,10once I got to vegas i gave up on worrying about airflow. I just built my computer case out of a mini fridge
<Caramel> 2,14 no one wants to watch my grind, I'll put on pmv's until we're ready to start up again
<BileGraze> Nevermind. Everyone is discussing other stuff and I don't think anyone will help. I'll just go to a different server.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Laptops are ok, but it doesnt give me the speed I need on my games

<Saturn> 08,01but... guess what i'm running my project on?
<BileGraze> Did I do it?
<Kandarihu> Is it pony related?
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[R]: as long as it's got 2-3 GB of RAM, sure, shouldn't be an issue at all.
<dynamo2814> ok wait....so whats wrong with cadence?
<Saturn> 08,01ethical hacking.
<HyperMetalLugia> So 3GB swap is good enough lol

<Glacymr> why are they removing mint4windows
<HyperMetalLugia> Honestly
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: Oh
<Kandarihu> In other words, white hat hacking?
<HyperMetalLugia> Really?
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: yup
<HyperMetalLugia> I never cared
<Bronysith> Freefall29: http://cheezburger.com/6588966144
<HyperMetalLugia> Or used it LOL
<Princess_Cadence> now what are we watching the game is over
<HyperMetalLugia> I just natively did it
<Dark92Enigma> COUNFOUND THAT SARCASM! IT LEADS ME TO UNPROTECTED BUTT FUN
<Freefall29> Bronysith: I saw this earlier man. awesome
<Caramel> 2,14 mfw no one reads what I type
<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: I would move to Europe just so I could be in you class to learfn that
<Glacymr> well they haven't removed it but make it more irritating
<Kandarihu> And grey hat hacking?
<Caramel> 2,14 I'm just putting on PMVs while I grind their levels up
<Glacymr> in linux mint 13 the only mint4windows they have is for 64 bit only
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[R]: well, it should tell you it on the box when you buy it, but you can also check the control panel (assuming you're using windows)
<Saturn> 08,01Spectrum_Rush: i could teach you anyway
<Saturn> 08,01it's actually quite easy to get started in hacking
<sub06905> We need each other!~
<Freefall29> Saturn: what kind of hacking?
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn is MLG Hacker? :D
<Bronysith> kingdom hearts <3
*Spectrum_Rush is intrigued
<Shizuka> 13it's easy to pass as a hacker
<Shizuka> 13step 1, acquire terminal emulator
<Shizuka> 13step 2, acquire textmode irc client
<Bronysith> step 2 ?
<Shizuka> 13step 3, chat
<dynamo2814> im not kidding when i say this but i will cry if or when the show gets cancelled
<Freefall29> Shizuka: step 4: ?????
<Shizuka> 13step 4, who knows what goes on in other people's heads, aka ???
<sub06905> then profit?
<Freefall29> Shizuka: step 5: profit
<Shizuka> 13step 5, OMFG SHE'S HACKING THE PENTAGON SUSPEND HER COMPUTER PRIVILEGES
<sub06905> lol
<Shizuka> 13you now know how my high school years went
<SpadeMagnes[R]> My dad said it would take longer to buy a desktop..so now I'm confused which is more powerful...
<prince-dari> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Yah
<weeping_pegasi82> oh shizuka....
<HyperMetalLugia> Which makes NO sense :|
<Freefall29> Shizuka: teach me you're ways so I can experience endless hours of lulz
<Freefall29> Shizuka: your
<Kandarihu> ZOMG! She's DDOSing the ISS! Someone remotely delete her System32!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What ever I get I'm stuck with for awhile
<Freefall29> pro tip: always use a proxy.
<RAWRity> I nearly got kicked out of high school when I tried to upgrade the RAM in my Computer in one of my classes.
<Shizuka> 13see.. when you're brought to the principal's office... i mean the "administrator's" office... and you can explain in more detail what you were doing than they can
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03That's why I disguise my work in the computer as Ponies, or, under drastic measures...
<Shizuka> 13and you actually get the details right
<prince-dari> Pro tip, use a VPN instead
<Shizuka> 13you're dealing with the american public school system
<Glacymr> wasn't it you who told me to use mint4windows if possible
<Glacymr> in case grub screws up lol
<RAWRity> Don't see what they were so pissed about.
<Thrackerzod> I hack my schools network all the time
<Kandarihu> Wow. The lifespan of my joke was well past half over by the time I sent that.
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh
<drfsupercenter> 03use GRUB
<drfsupercenter> 03HML is stupid sometimes, just trust me on this
<Thrackerzod> yet they yell at kids who go on flash games
<RAWRity> I payed for the RAM sticks myself.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's super easy to fix GRUB if it breaks
<Glacymr> drf
<drfsupercenter> 03you just need a livebooting disc
<drfsupercenter> 03or flash drive
<Glacymr> i'm only asking if he's the one who said it
<Shizuka> 13at one point we'd collected a handful of the network admin passwords, all variations on "P@ssw0rd" of course
<Shizuka> 13never used them
<Glacymr> or else i will forever be cursed of not knowing who said that
<prince-dari> Lawl
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Scoot-Scootaloo: if drastic then r34 ponies? nobody will dare to lack at that
<weeping_pegasi82> smile like you mean it!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03>_>
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol this :D
<twilight_sprinkle> *look
<Princess_Cadence> ;)
<Shizuka> 13we had the address for the district's network proxy and frequently routed ssh tunnels around it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> AMD Athlon X2 Dual-Core QL-64 2.10 GHz is the processor of my current computer
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> yay~
<weeping_pegasi82> yay
<sub06905> AJ!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I dont know computer power so I have NO idea how bad or good that is
<Kandarihu> Congrats
<Obsidian> Caramel: Congrats
<Shizuka> 13actually my best story is that in my last year i was banned from computers for like half the year because i ran VNC to my home desktop so i could use a version of MSOffice that wasn't from 1993
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[R]: it's not awful. Decent for AMD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,0264 ping o.o
<Shizuka> 13but OMFG YOU COULD LET VIRUSES IN
<Freefall29> Shizuka: remind me to never piss you off.....
*Bronysith glomps NewSuperBronyU
*NewSuperBronyU hugs Bronysith back :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> it has 3.00 GB of RAM
<Derpy_Hooves> NewSuperBronyU: \:3/
<Sumica> 00,10I think my computer has lost it's mind, time for restart

<Princess_Cadence> hi derpy
<LadyCanary> Derpy_Hooves! SuperBrony! :3
<sub06905> dat Bob :3
<Freefall29> SpadeMagnes[R]: not laging for me bro
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6570266112
<Derpy_Hooves> LadyCanary: \:3/ *hugs*
<superretroworld> just learned the basics of paint.net about background and icon making, its alot of fun
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I mean when ever I do shit like play WoW it lags like a bitch
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[R]: could very well be your internet
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.codeweavers.com/flockthevote/ < Haha
<Glacymr> lol
<Freefall29> SpadeMagnes[R]: when did you buy your pc?
<HyperMetalLugia> I never said anything about grub
<HyperMetalLugia> or mint4win
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<prince-dari> Using VB script in Excel to get around Windows software restriction policy was pretty funny
<HyperMetalLugia> I dislike the windows installers anyway
<weeping_pegasi82> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> I only said GRUB is slow
<sub06905> dat derpy
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh god...this was years ago and this isnt even mine origionaly.. let me see...
<drfsupercenter> 03GRUB isn't slow o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03GRUB2 is just a bloated pile of crap
<Kandarihu> Caramel, awesome
<Reikim> ...So this is a pretty good place to get join up the stream, isn't it?
<HyperMetalLugia> That's what I meant
<drfsupercenter> 03simple: use the original one..
<HyperMetalLugia> GRUB2 takes like 5 seconds JUST to load the menu :|
<HyperMetalLugia> Uh how
<drfsupercenter> 03by using an older version of Linux obviously.
<drfsupercenter> 03and if it's something like Ubuntu, when you upgrade it, you can tell it to keep the older GRUB
<Freefall29> SpadeMagnes[R]: this is a good sign your pc is getting old
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I think 3 years...I dont really recall
<Cades> lol this is hilarious :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OviK2FWFom0&feature=g-u-u
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[R]: laptop or desktop?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Laptop
<Reikim> Three years? Oh, that's just middle age in computer tERMS> Don't sweat it.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I said I think 3 years I really dont remember how long I had this thing
<Reikim> ...this guy fails history. Forever.
<dynamo2814> i wonder if scoot will ever fly? season 4 perhaps?
<Glacymr> i don't think i'll have enough time to get linux up tonight
<prince-dari> >implying there will be a S4
<RAWRity> Reikim: that's good seeing as he's Historical Inaccuracy
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It has a really low Window's Index rating
<Reikim> ...Canadian Stereotype.
<prince-dari> Maybe they'll finish at 3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> a 3.1
<Princess_Cadence> if there is a season 4
<Reikim> I love this guy.
<Princess_Cadence> lol
<Freefall29> prince-dari: its gonna make it to season 4... I can feel it. season 5, not yet
<Spectrum_Rush> dari implying theres a 3
<Obsidian> prince-dari: dont say that :S
<RAWRity> prince-dari: eh, doubtful.
<HyperMetalLugia> Why are you installing it any way?
<prince-dari> RAWRity: We can always live in hope
<prince-dari> I just want to see the reactions when FiM ends
<prince-dari> So many delicious tears
<dynamo2814> princess cadence....dont say that....there will be at least there better be
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: its a gold mine so far, they wouldnt want to stop
<Reikim> I don't. There's going to be SO much butthurt
<Freefall29> prince-dari: implying that the next show will suck.
<prince-dari> Implying it won't
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I think I had this since 2009, I'm just guessing here
<RAWRity> prince-dari: considering how much money Hasbro's been putting into MLP, I don't see them just cutting it at 65 episodes.
<Glacymr> because a coin flip told me to
<prince-dari> We'll see...
<prince-dari> 65 episodes and a feature length film.
<Kandarihu> I liked the first WTF Collective, not the second one
<Spectrum_Rush> prince-dari: and when that day comes you'll have just the pic for it :S
<Reikim> Fuck yes, Canada.
*drfsupercenter hands you Harvey Dent's coin
<prince-dari> Finished.
<prince-dari> Spectrum_Rush: AHAHAHAH
<Glacymr> actually drf
<prince-dari> Yes, of course
<Dovah> what is this?
<prince-dari> Beautiful
<Glacymr> tails was to install windows 7
<Glacymr> heads was to keep windows vista XD
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> So you didn't flip it!
<Glacymr> if it was harvey dent's coin
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: PMv.
<HyperMetalLugia> Lazy :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'm going to take a shower... I'll be back in a few
<Glacymr> it would have been heads
<Wirisme> Hey everyone
<Freefall29> sup Wirisme!!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Wirisme! :)
<RAWRity> prince-dari: I figure they'll at least get it up to 88 episodes for syndication.
<thelonepony> hi Wirisme :)
<prince-dari> And then delicious tears time?
<Wirisme> How are we all today? :)
<RAWRity> prince-dari: possibly.
<Freefall29> prince-dari: don't cry because its over, smile because it happened
<prince-dari> >implying I care if it finishes
<AJIsAwesome> I'm pretty sure the highest they'll go is season 4. If they make any later seasons, that'd be great.
<weeping_pegasi82> ?
<Glacymr> college almost forces me to use windows
<Kandarihu> prince-dari, if we can make through the inevitable war with Iran without all of our technology getting destroyed by an EMP, Hasbro will probably find a way to capitalize on our love somehow. And FiM will keep going on as long as that's there.
<Reikim> YUS
<weeping_pegasi82> yes
<prince-dari> Pfft
<Freefall29> dat spike
<prince-dari> It's going to end sometime
<Reikim> So who here has played the Applejack one? Because that was really hard.
<weeping_pegasi82> oh twilight
<otakon> prince-dari: the fandom has finally evolved to the point where we can MAKE our own episodes.
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: I have.
<prince-dari> Bullshit
<dynamo2814> i think theyll make nore than 4 just because of the fandom
<otakon> prince-dari: Double Rainboom, Picture Perfect Pony
<HyperMetalLugia> Same with my school
<prince-dari> Some 3 minute shorts that took months?
<HyperMetalLugia> And I've gotten tired of how horrible the image they want
<Reikim> Be distracted by the Twi in the background. Be very distracted.
<Princess_Cadence> o.o
<prince-dari> They're not going to have time to make full episodes
<HyperMetalLugia> You can't be admin, can't easily change the *taskbar or background*
<Glacymr> well my technical reporting teacher puts docx files on blackboard
<Kandarihu> Oh, she lost her trumpet
<HyperMetalLugia> So it's ugly :z
<prince-dari> Not unless they quit their jobs
<prince-dari> And we fund them all
<otakon> prince-dari: actually for one guy that's impressive, so just add in SEVERAL people combining their efforts
<prince-dari> Pay their salary
<Glacymr> that libreoffice has no idea how to show correctly
<Kandarihu> She found it
<weeping_pegasi82> I would
<HyperMetalLugia> Ouch
<dynamo2814> weell this is.....strange
<Glacymr> and it's so bad that i can barely read some parts of the document
<Glacymr> then i have a crystal report writer class
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: well its survived through g3 and g3.6, they probably made enough money to last several more seasons
<nickstr> I use Windows because A, its compatible with more hardware and B, more niche and special purpose software runs on it
<DashWithRainbows> Besides, if fans were to continue the show, it would get old and stale.
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6582474240
<Glacymr> i use linux because i feel more comfy security wise
<Glacymr> the average hacker isn't going to suspect the average computer user to be using linux
<prince-dari> DashWithRainbows: And the OCs
<superretroworld> how many times have we seen this on bronystate?
<HyperMetalLugia> I use linux because I want to troll the IT Department ;D
<prince-dari> Oh God, the OCs
<twilight_sprinkle> well true, if fans did it we wouldnt see the same characters
<prince-dari> BURN IT
<chhchickenCX> CX
<prince-dari> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> <.<
<HyperMetalLugia> And I can screw with stuff and break it then fix it
<Reikim> Look at Rarity. So much class.
<otakon> prince-dari: calm your tits brit.
<DashWithRainbows> Look at the Pokemon anime, that's been going on for years. Only now are they trying to make an actual change by getting rid of Ash and putting in different characters.
<chhchickenCX> Whos up for season 3:)
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah, just gonna put it out there. I dont care if FiM is cancelled at the time, I will NOT show a fucking fanmade episode
<twilight_sprinkle> we would have pitch-black OCs with blood-red eyes and "PWNER" cutie marks
<nickstr> you can't run $hit on Linux
<weeping_pegasi82> me!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So much negativity
<Glacymr> with wine or virtualbox you can
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Me.... maybe
<SpadeMagnes[R]> >Implying every OC is bad
<Glacymr> anyway i got to bbl
<Reikim> Yeah, I'mma gonna focus on Rarity and her mad golfing skills.
<Caramel> 2,14 if used in a fanshow? yes, it is
<chhchickenCX> Lol
<twilight_sprinkle> oh let me show you my OC
<Glacymr> apparently some relatives are just giving away a laptop to me
<Glacymr> and i need to go pick it up
*Nittany_Discord hates OC elitism.
<DashWithRainbows> dari Red striped alicorn OC's with bat wings and have sex with all the mane 6... Yep, sounds like an awesome show.
<chhchickenCX> O-o
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Again implying every OC is bad
<twilight_sprinkle> heres my OC http://i364.photobucket.com/albums/oo86/kyuubi_yura/ponyart_ed.jpg
<nickstr> not really
<sub06905> DashWithRainbows: wut XD
<Sumica> 00,10did I come back to drama?
<nickstr> the software I use can't be ruin with Wine
<Kandarihu> I just REALLY want to hear Fluttershy's complaints about the dress Rarity made for her in a results section of this.
<nickstr> or Virtualbox
<chhchickenCX> I gues you did
<RAWRity> If I felt the fanmade "episode" was quality, I'd show it.
<nickstr> its too demanding in terms of CPU clock cycles
<Reikim> WHAT AN ORIGINAL OC IT'S AWESOME WHAT'S ITS STORY
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle: paint pony is best pony
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No sumi, you came to a bronystate chatroom :P
<LadyCanary> O U
<DashWithRainbows> Do ho ho
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Take a look at Picture Perfect Pony
<SpadeMagnes[R]> That had good quality
<DashWithRainbows> Um, no.
<chhchickenCX> cx
<dynamo2814> i love that pmv
<Nittany_Discord> There are roads that a pony must pony.
<prince-dari> Again, 3 minute short, not full episode, already established characters.
<Reikim> ...Applejack is best Samurai. FORever.
<Kandarihu> Well, if an OC-centric fan episode has the feel of a lower deck episode of the main series, I'd appreciate it.
<Freefall29> SpadeMagnes[R]: I agree, proof that fans can make good videos
<Freefall29> please note, I said can
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Agreed.
<DashWithRainbows> prince-dari We'd have to wait a year and a half for them to make just the animation
<otakon> prince-dari: still it can be done
<prince-dari> No, it really can't
<Wirisme> Depends how many people work on it
<otakon> I love the props in the back from the other events
<DashWithRainbows> then comes getting audio and stuff.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03besides, I already saw parts of DRB, it was eh~
<Freefall29> prince-dari: well... what if a a group of fans made a full, 20 minute like episode. would you play that?
<otakon> prince-dari: yes yes it can it just won't come out every two weeks
<twilight_sprinkle> but can fans make full episodes with good animation, good writing and to keep the characters personalities in check? i doubt it
<drfsupercenter> 03well that sucked
<prince-dari> Because they'd fuck up by either catering too much to bronies, or adding in OCs, or just plain shitty story writing
<DashWithRainbows> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a leak in the water cooler, it's making the floor wet
<Reikim> ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03and since it's tile
<Kandarihu> SUUUUPPPAAAAAAAAAA
<drfsupercenter> 03I was walking to the bathroom and slipped on it
<drfsupercenter> 03banged up my knee
<drfsupercenter> 03fricking limping now
<twilight_sprinkle> also biased writing
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Again...implying each of them would be retarded with their ideas
<drfsupercenter> 03and I don't even kinow if there's enough towls in this house to dry it
<Reikim> Anyway...a Rhythm Heaven pony game like this? Man,m if only it could really exist.
<shibaru> My sim keeps wanting to woohoo in the hot tub... She can't go in the hot tub now....
<RAWRity> still waiting for Fighting is Magic
<otakon> it's coming
<Freefall29> RAWRity: thats still in development... wow
<Storm_Chaser> HEllo
<otakon> suddenly deaf
<LadyCanary> I played some of it, RAWRity. So far Im working well with Pinkie Pie.
<otakon> hiya Storm_Chaser
<weeping_pegasi82> yay more ponymon!
<Reikim> Now...More making colourfulo cartoon ponies fight each other to the death.
<Spectrum_Rush> RAWRity: Soonâ„¢
<Wirisme> Ah I haven't seen this :)
<Sumica> 00,10Naughty nature
<Reikim> Also: Bronystate has its own music thingie now? I'm interested.
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: I avoided playing the leaked demo.
<Freefall29> Spectrum_Rush: I see what you did there
<otakon> hiya LadyCanary :)
<Kandarihu> /) RAWRity
<Yahooz> Twilight is OP in leaked demo
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: (\
<Reikim> F ZECORA?
<Spectrum_Rush> Filly
<Freefall29> Yahooz: in what way?
*Storm_Chaser hugs Otakon tightly "Thanks"
<Sumica> 00,10Filly, aparently
<Kandarihu> Reikim, Filly Zecora
<Storm_Chaser> How is Everypony today?
<Reikim> Aha
<AJIsAwesome> I never bother playing demos or leakd stuff. I always play the full version of things.
<Freefall29> Storm_Chaser: awesome.
<Reikim> BIG MAC CAN TAKE THIS
<AJIsAwesome> Hi Storm_Chaser :)
<Yahooz> Freefall29: have you played the leaked demo? i dont want to spoil anything for you
<Freefall29> Yahooz: not yet
<Sumica> 00,10Demos are good, leaks are not
<Reikim> Yus
<Reikim> YUS
<Bronysith> Yahooz: fighting is magic?
<Yahooz> then again, no spoilers in main
<LadyCanary> .-.
<Yahooz> Bronysith: yep
<Reikim> Colours~
<thelonepony> Yes code geass ost!!
<AJIsAwesome> I'd still rather just wait for the full game rather than playing a demo.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I hate I have to decide wether I want a Laptop or desktop..what ever I pick I'm stuck with it for awhile...
<Bronysith> Code Geass's best Opener
<thelonepony> ^
*Storm_Chaser Hugs AJIsAwesome "Thanks"
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[R]: true, but with a desktop you can upgrade it
<Yahooz> Freefall29: look at their livestreams, you'll see why. You can tell as of the demo shes the most worked on character
<Sumica> 00,10SpadeMagnes[R], are you on the go alot?
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: D you travel around a lot?
<Sumica> 00,10and for that matter will you have acces to web if on the go.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wel..not now I'm homeschooled and I dont go out much
<DashWithRainbows> Desktop.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I dont even have a car of my own yet
<Yahooz> Pinkie apperently used to be OP, but then they completely nerfed her
<Sumica> 00,10aye desktop
<Freefall29> Yahooz: I had a feeling they would have a personal bias towards one of the ponies... hope they fix it soon.
<Reikim> It's odd. CG's openings kind of went downhill. COLOURS was awesome. R2's first opening was acceptable, and grew on you. R2's second opening...I just can't like it.
<Yahooz> Freefall29: oh yeah, theyll fix it as best they can by beta
<weeping_pegasi82> doctor whooves!!!!
<Princess_Cadence> hehe a dr Whooves
<RAWRity> Freefall29: "personal bias"
<RAWRity> what
<Reikim> Freefall29: They don't. It's just really, really hard to make a balanced fighting game.
<Bronysith> Reikim: i just think the first opening is the best
<AJIsAwesome> Dr. Whooves. :O
<thelonepony> hi Storm_Chaser didn't see you there i just came back :)
<Sumica> 00,10ewwwwww they used that version of whooves
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :O Dr.Whooves?!
<Caramel> 2,14 sumica: my thoughts exactly
<Reikim> DAMMIT
<RAWRity> Sumica: damn straight they did.
<Reikim> Wrong Whooves!
<Caramel> 2,14 why the fuck use a custom one to look like matt smith?
<Freefall29> any news yet on unlockable characters yet for fighting is magic?
<RAWRity> sub06905: also, Dat Lass
<Caramel> 2,14 the Tennant one is canon AND looks cooler
<chhchickenCX> lol
<Sumica> 00,10exactly

<Sumica> 00,10So will you name him Not tennet?
<Freefall29> I've heard a rumor about a my little pony fps game being made by fans.... Its probobly gonna go through a lot of hurdles.

<chhchickenCX> xD
<weeping_pegasi82> :O
<Spectrum_Rush> i get the feeling Caramel does not like trixie
<SpadeMagnes[R]> When did Windows change the box design to be less blocky?
<Freefall29> Wirisme: that would be awesome. 13 episodes of non-stop spike. *explodes*
<Bronysith> DIE TRIXIE DIE
<Princess_Cadence> lol @ Val

<weeping_pegasi82> so awesome /)^3^(\
<Reikim|Crowbar> Sumica: Depends on which version of "befriending" you're using. I prefer the version that involves KILLING EVERYTHING IN FIRE
<Freefall29> what sucks is that I work on saturdays.... I miss out on ponies! :'(
<Sumica> 00,10especaly when I cant photoshop RAWRity
<Reikim|Crowbar> And GIANT MAGIC LASER BEAMS
<sub06905> i have a feeling Caramel loves Trixie
<RAWRity> Sumica: clearly your computer's sentient
<Sumica> 00,10I was refering to the Nanoha version Reikim|Crowbar
<Reikim|Crowbar> ...So wait, Trixie is a PSYCHIC type?
<Freefall29> Reikim|Crowbar: seems legit
<Reikim|Crowbar> Sumica: Funny, that's what I was referring to. /), by the way.
<Sumica> 00,10you know hitthem with gundam class beamweapons
<SpadeMagnes[R]> My super old desktop has the very very old version of the window design
<chhchickenCX> Lol if he picked party.MOV
<Reikim|Crowbar> Having issues with your angsty teenage daughter? NUKE HER WITH MAGICAL LASER BEAMS
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :O Trixie~!
<Dovah> all this da music
<Freefall29> Reikim|Crowbar: and the beams do what again to her?
<Kandarihu> Sumica, I tried looking up that date on EqD but got nothing.
<Reikim|Crowbar> Your best friend refusing to open up to you? NUKE HER WITH MAGICAL LASER BEAMS.
<chhchickenCX> yesss!!
<chhchickenCX> aj won
<Reikim|Crowbar> Your students acting up and not behaving? Guess how we deal with that one.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Good to see Team Rocket is incompetent as ever
<sub06905> Trixie NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!! ;-;
<Sumica> 00,10lookclosely at the sorce Kandarihu
<Dark92Enigma> OOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
<Freefall29> what pony does team rocket send after you
<Sumica> 00,10it was EQD falling for a troll and I caught a screen shot of it
<chhchickenCX> sistervsbro
<Freefall29> Sumica: I gotta see that screen
<Reikim> And as everyone knows, Applejack can beat the living friendship out of Big Mac.
<Dark92Enigma> otakon: What was the emulator you talked about? CoolRooms, right?
<Sumica> 00,10http://screensnapr.com/v/DXyjTf.jpg
<Kandarihu> Ah, I see.
<Sumica> 00,10the W in network is actaly two V's
<Reikim> Dark92Enigma: DopeRoms for ROMS and emulators.
<Freefall29> Sumica: that troll deserves +10 internets.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I used to think EQD had decency and quality to it and the sources it gets
<Sumica> 00,10so it's Netvvork
<sub06905> lol
<RAWRity> I find it funny that some people i've talked to STILL think S3 will start in september
<chhchickenCX> Wear pony shirts if you have one for season 3
<RAWRity> OMIGAH DINKY CATCH HER
<Reikim> BIG MAC'S GOT DIS
<JESmith71> Reikim: DGemu's also good
<weeping_pegasi82> he already did
<chhchickenCX> clonewars
<Yahooz> Sumica: 4 more dayz. hurr durr
<Reikim> ...Damn. Imagine a cloned army of Big Macintosh.
<chhchickenCX> tiill what?
<Kandarihu> Maybe in a later release, Ponymons like F Big Mac will be listed as C Big Mac
<Freefall29> Yahooz: then we pull out our drinks and watch the butt hurt
<sub06905> ohai trixie
<Sumica> 00,10seeing as there have not even been ads for it
<Yahooz> oh yeah, people will be rushing on that day
<SpadeMagnes[R]> KILL THE IDIOT
<Sumica> 00,10yeah we are still at least a month from it
<Freefall29> chhchickenCX: EQD fell for a troll claiming that season 3 starts on sept 22....
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I want to see him in pain
<Kandarihu> Ah, I see.
<Bronysith> thats a new one
<Yahooz> I call it premieres the second week of November
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why did I actually think EQD was decent?
<Freefall29> I say season 3 starts on dec 22, 2012
<Sumica> 00,10I would like to see an oct 26 air date.
<chhchickenCX> awww
<RAWRity> Sumica: People are stupid/desperate. One guy I know said he expected advertisements/announcements this saturday, and then S3 would start September 29
<weeping_pegasi82> I guessed oct. 13
<Lasharus> Remind me, isn't that the 'end of the world' date Freefall29?
<superretroworld> Freefall29: oh come on it cant be that long, im guessing late october
<RAWRity> Sumica: that sounds about right. I'm personally expected November
<RAWRity> *expecting
<Sumica> 00,10just think some day they might add r63 ponymons to this
<SpadeMagnes[R]> End of the world...yea... and we've had how many "predictions" of the end of the world now?
<DashWithRainbows> ohai Lasharus, haven't seen you around here for a while.
<Freefall29> I can't wait till dec 21st and everyone looks like a major douchebag.
<chhchickenCX> well do the math...theres only 13 episodes told by tara strong so im guessing october but maybe sebtember
<Reikim> Lasharus: Yes. On December 21, 2012, the split universes will collide together once more, and in their collision all will be crushed. We will burn in the hellfires of dimensional collapse...and it will all be /his/ fault.
<JESmith71> |It probably will be late October, some people said it will be four weeks after they announce the airdate
<Sumica> 00,10oh I just want a happy birthday is all RAWRity I dont even thnk it's a saterday =p
<chhchickenCX> september**
<Lasharus> Oh I know SpadeMagnes[R]. I don't really set any store whatsoever by it. :P
<weeping_pegasi82> And why are people listening to the aztecs again?
<Wirisme> god ... the amount of tards that will be running round on that day Freefall
<superretroworld> chhchickenCX: remember, without math we are dirty caveman eating mud!!!!
<Freefall29> weeping_pegasi82: it was the myans
<RAWRity> I'm not looking forward to december. The internet will be filled with 2012 memes
<weeping_pegasi82> whatever
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'll be sitting here chilling playing WoW
<Kandarihu> You know what? There really should be a Pokemon romhack that just swaps the humans and the Pokemon.
<Lasharus> Reikim, I have no idea which theory THAT one is, but it sounds remarkably inane.
<JESmith71> And if they announce it at Canterlot Gardens then it would be the 27th
<Freefall29> Wirisme: dude. around early december. i'm gonna ask people to give me their stuff, like houses or money. they won't need it when they're dead
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does no one ever fucking think the Myans never finished their calendar or just stopped?
<Reikim> Lasharus: Actually it was a reference to RahXephon and I was hoping RAWRity would pick up on it but oh well.
<Wirisme> Sounds like a plan lol
<Lasharus> D'aw. Sorry Reikim. :p
<weeping_pegasi82> stupid myans
<Lasharus> Anyway, bedtime f'r me. Got work tomorrow.
<Lasharus> 'night.
<OneTrickPony> good afternoon everyone ^_^
<Wirisme> Hope the idiots don't riot too hard
<Freefall29> bye bye Lasharus
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So it stopped on ONE DAY that means fucking nothing
<Reikim> SpadeMagnes[R]: They did neither. They just reset it. Like a giant clock.
<AJIsAwesome> Nightm Lasharus
<chhchickenCX> @superretroworld lol
<AJIsAwesome> Him OneTrickPony
<AJIsAwesome> *Hi
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], a lot of people realize that the Mayans didn't really predict the end of the world.
<superretroworld> night Lasharus
<chhchickenCX> ugh did it wrong v.v
<superretroworld> hey OneTrickPony
<Freefall29> you guys remember the may 21st raptures.... its all coming back to me now
<Sumica> 00,10exactly SpadeMagnes[R]
<chhchickenCX> when will this video end
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is there no other reason besides people being fucking morons when they "assumed" the end of the calendar was doomsday
<OneTrickPony> what are we watching?
<Sumica> 00,10start writeing numbers on a page of paper, sooner or later you run out of space
<superretroworld> SpadeMagnes[R]: yes, the fucking move
<Reikim> Okaaaay, clearing things here. The Mayan Calendar...doesn't end. It resets. Like a clock. Hell, the Gregorian calendar did the same thing years ago, nobody gave a damn.
<sub06905> What The Mayans Thought: http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Mayan_01d220_1849449.jpg
<Freefall29> even the myans are sick and tried of this whole end of the world thing.... the calender was written eons ago, back in a time we thought the world was flat and earth was the center of the universe.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Thank you.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Of all the conclusions they could have drawn and its doomsday
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Exactly. :|
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why is humanity plauged with retards
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> Nobody listened.
<Freefall29> SpadeMagnes[R]: retards with liberal arts degrees
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I listened
<dynamo2814> spademagnes good question
<Reikim> So how dead are we today?
<RosePetal> Go Derpy!
<Freefall29> i'm gonna brb everypony
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not more than normal
<weeping_pegasi82> ditzy doo
<superretroworld> bye Freefall29
<Reikim> Rate it on a level from "cessation of all existence past present and future" to "shambling zombie".
<sub06905> bai Freefall29
<AJIsAwesome> Bye Freefall29
<OneTrickPony> see ya Freefall29
<thelonepony> bye Freefall29
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], we are imperfect mortal beings. The worst of us are the ones who are convinced that we are not, and that relying on our own sense of reasoning leads to enlightenment.
<chhchickenCX> byee
<Freefall29> i'm not leaving guys....
<Freefall29> lol
<chhchickenCX> lolk
<Discord-Drocsid> you know what i find sad about Ponymon Dawn/Dusk
<superretroworld> Freefall29: sorry, didnt read the text right
<RosePetal> Go Ditzy!
<Freefall29> i'm just gonna leave the pc for a second. tis all
<weeping_pegasi82> what?
<AJIsAwesome> Discord-Drocsid: What?
<Discord-Drocsid> that hoof stomp isnt actually accurate
<thelonepony> what?
<Reikim> Kandarihu: I agree with the former, not the latter. Depends on your definition of enlightenment.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Discord-Drocsid> its completely upside down
<weeping_pegasi82> how
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I get tired of the "Doomsday prediction" crap that shows up on tv
<chhchickenCX> Im kinda getting sick of this video..
<Sumica> 00,10Oh god, new TV show. Toy hunter, first ep Hasbro colectors items.
<Caramel> 2,14 that's because they use the stomp graphic
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> both ?
<Caramel> 2,14 which is based off of Tauros
<Discord-Drocsid> http://www.all-natural-horse-care.com/image-files/feral-horse-hoof.jpg
<LadyCanary> I saw it, Sumica :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wasnt glue made from horse feet?
<RAWRity> ...oh my god
<LadyCanary> Well, not that ep but the show itself is pretty cool
<weeping_pegasi82> there cartoons get over it
<Discord-Drocsid> where is it
<RAWRity> NASA has apparently started working on Warp Drive technology.
<Discord-Drocsid> what channel
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: It used to be made from various parts of horses, but know it isn't, I think.
<Sumica> 00,10dont know, just saw an ad for it
<Kandarihu> Reikim, okay. Maybe enlightenment wasn't the right thing to put it.
<LadyCanary> Val, this sounds awfully familiar. What song is this?
<Reikim> Kandarihu: Besides, those who utilize reason as a tool for finding truth msot often inevitably come to the conclusion that we are imperfect.
<Bronysith> KILL IT
<chhchickenCX> Ok serriously..
<Bronysith> KILL IT
<Princess_Cadence> SPIKE :O
<RAWRity> DAT LASS
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: the point is to be as reasonable as we can. otherwise we're just animals
<chhchickenCX> :P
<Bronysith> DIE SPIKE DIE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I saw this one thing on tv that said some philosipher, I forget his name, predicted several things in our time and a supposed" dooms day"
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, yeah.
<LadyCanary> Spike getting pumped. Awwww.
<RosePetal> Go AppleJack!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> just made some pizza from scratch and MAN is it good :$
<chhchickenCX> lol
<Reikim> SpadeMagnes[R]: Nicodemus. He was a druggie. True facts.
<chhchickenCX> yum
<RosePetal> Next is Twilight.
<Bronysith> you know, everyone is an awful friend to twilight except Applejack really
<Sumica> 00,10wonder if spike evloves in to macho spike
<RosePetal> That's kinda true.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Sumica> 00,10or just spike with stash
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So we belive the words of one man who may not be right in the head
<Discord-Drocsid> so how long does it take to get out of a cave?
<Glacymr> back
<RAWRity> I know wrek want's an F Twilight
<superretroworld> Bronysith: what do you mean?
<Reikim> SpadeMagnes[R]: No we don't. Most people will tell you he's bullshit. Most people haven't even heard of him, in fact.
<RosePetal> So many Big Macs.
<Bronysith> superretroworld: in the season 2 finale, applejack is the only one to apologize to her, out of all her friends, applejack is the only one with the decency to apologize
<dynamo2814> theyre like zubat arent they
<chhchickenCX> HOW LONG IS THIS!!?.... :[
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Which was one of the reasons why I preferred AJ over any of the others IMO.
<Reikim> A cave full of Big Mac clones. I wonder how the fillies and mares of Ponyville would react to that...
<weeping_pegasi82> spike evolves into nightmare night spike...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Then there was some bullshit about dooms day being predicted in some Islam manuscript or something
<Kandarihu> However, our wisdom will always be imperfect and our knowledge will always be limited. The worst atrocities of the 20th centuries were all caused by people who relied on their own sense of reason.
<RosePetal> They apologized to her offscreen I think, but yeah you have a point.
<Reikim> SpadeMagnes[R]: Far as I know, the Coran says nothing about Doomsday. There's a bit about a Final Judgement, but no word on a date.
<RosePetal> Whoa, it's Snails.
<LadyCanary> Oh duuuude.
<AJIsAwesome> Snails. :O
<Bronysith> That is why Applejack is Twilights only nice friend
<weeping_pegasi82> how come it's always so entertaining to watch someone else play videogames?
<Reikim> Kandarihu: Not because they relied on it, but because their reasoning was faulty.
<superretroworld> Bronysith: yeah, but in winter wrashe was pretty harsh to twilight even though it was twilights fault, idk
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Nice to know you know that stuff because I never payed attention to that bullshit
<superretroworld> wrap up*
<RAWRity> Bronysith: riiiiiiiight
<superretroworld> sorry big screw up there
<Glacymr> darnit
<Kandarihu> All of our reasoning is faulty.
<Bronysith> superretroworld: but she is the only one to apologize to her when no one else believed her,
<Glacymr> i wish i had one of those things now
<Glacymr> to convert an internal hard drive into USB
<Bronysith> bored now "proceeds to gangnam style on RAWRity s head"
<RosePetal> Ooh, there's Colgate.
<Shizuka> 13the unsung work of a bronystate sysadmin http://i.imgur.com/7rUsn.png
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Still annoyed no one apologized to twilight after the wedding fiasco
<LadyCanary> Gosh Caramel, I didnt realize you liked so much metal music :3 :3 me gusta.
<Reikim> I like to know a bit or two about our local religious groups. Really, after over a dozen years being drowned in Catholicism, you start to welcome the quirks and interesting bits about other religions.
<Freefall29> ok... I'm back everypony
<RosePetal> Spades, AppleJack did.
<superretroworld> Bronysith: shes one of my favorites including pinkie because shes always there
<OneTrickPony> wb Freefall29
<Shizuka> 13ded ded
<chhchickenCX> lolyey
<RosePetal> It's Spike!
<Freefall29> spike!
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: metal is only the hammer of ...fuck i do not remember the brutal legend reference
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Kinda pissed Celestia didnt
<Freefall29> SPIKE!!!!
<thelonepony> wb Freefall29
<thelonepony> Spike!
<LadyCanary> .....I will slap you Bronysith >_> not for not remembering the quote.
<Freefall29> spike is best non pony, non main 6 character
<twilight_sprinkle> :<
<twilight_sprinkle> poor spike
<Reikim> Kandarihu: Yes, all reasoning is fundamentally flawed, because we have to make the assumption that our senses are not lying to us. Everything boils down to belief, at some level. Those who choose to disbelieve are, I believe, known as Existentialists.
<twilight_sprinkle> forever a slave
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fax Machine
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: metal is the sound of god hitting his hammer against the anvil of pure bliss
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Don't get me wrong, but the fact that they all saw that Twilight ws right all along was good enough for me. i still would've liked it if they apologized, though.
<weeping_pegasi82> assisstant
<Reikim> Doubel negative, means we're alive.
<weeping_pegasi82> O_O
<superretroworld> Freefall29: so technically hes in competition with the costume twilight rainbow and rarity wore
<RAWRity> By the furnace, by the hammer, by the tongs, and by the hammer, by the dwelling of the black smith, by the fire within the furnace
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: but they didnt apologize! they shouldve but they were like "oh hey, she was right.. what do you know"
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: I know. I'm just saying.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And Celestia the pony who raised twilight for years, was pretty much a mother to her didnt say shit
<Kandarihu> Reikim, ever heard of Messianic Judaism?
<chhchickenCX> So one more question....On wikipedia it says the list of the MLP episodes it says season 3 chrystal empire...is that right?
<Sumica> 00,10what AJ dont know Buck?
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[R]: the show lacks consistency, lol
<RosePetal> Actually, I was more upset that her own brother didnt apologize to her.
<Reikim> Kandarihu: ...No, actually. What is it?
<RAWRity> Now forsooth thou hast grown mighty. Thou canst rage in wildest fury. Thou hast broken all thy pledges, all thy solemn vows hast broken
<Reikim> chhchickenCX: Hey. By the way. Take a trip by the rules page, read the bit on discussing spoilers.
<otakon> CATCH THAT LYRA!
<Sumica> 00,10chhchickenCX, gonna head you off there. Dont go leading in to things taht might be spoilers
<Freefall29> dat song
<RosePetal> It's Lilly!
<LadyCanary> ...NOOOOOOOO
<superretroworld> fuck if theres anyone apoligzing its everyone involved in that wedding
<weeping_pegasi82> oh no
<LadyCanary> Wait. Dat Miku? o_o
<Kandarihu> It's sort of Christianity aimed to more focus on how it was for the original generation of Christians, who faced persecution at the hands of the Roman Empire
<Freefall29> who's apologzing, for what?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I guess thats one reason why I like Twilight, because the rest of her "friends" can be real jerks sometimes
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: there we go ... â€œIt is the pounding of creations hammer on the anvil of time
<chhchickenCX> I just gave the title and i didnt mean to it was on wiki but i dont know if its right.
<chhchickenCX> Sorry
<Freefall29> SpadeMagnes[R]: well, execpt spike. since she gives him a free place to stay
<HyperMetalLugia> I want one of those too
<Kandarihu> chhchickenCX, yeah. Upcoming episode titles are spoilers. This place is kindof a sanctuary from that.
<RosePetal> Wait, didn't during Discord was Twilight being a jerk to her friends and didnt realize they were discorded?
<Bronysith> Freefall29: spike is a slave
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> prince-dari: Game Grumps! :D /)
<otakon> no no
<otakon> Game Derps
<Sumica> 00,10did't say you were spoiling chhchickenCX, was just heading you off before things went that way
<otakon> She's Derp, she's not so Derp
<Kandarihu> Is this some sort of Vocaloid version of Carameldansen?
<weeping_pegasi82> ya ther's no pinkie pie lrft in that move!
<otakon> they're the Game Derps
<Reikim> Kandarihu: Cool. Isn't that a bit flawed, though? Religion should adapt to the times, not try to perpetuate stagnation.
<superretroworld> Bronysith: thank you
<RAWRity> Tell who drove thee to this mischief! Tell who taught thee all thy malice! Tell who givest thee thine evil!
<Freefall29> Bronysith: can you stop bringing that up every time I mention spike. you're just trying to piss me off on purprose
<weeping_pegasi82> *there's
<weeping_pegasi82> *left
<Bronysith> Freefall29: im not trying to piss you off. it is true that spike is a slave
<Kinixys> There is the issue that people bring their own bias into reasoning.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> >Element of honesty can tell if someone is lying, >Doesnt belive twilight during the wedding
<Reikim> Caramel: That grun took issue to your use of the radio.
<RAWRity> Did thy father, or thy mother? Did the eldest of thy brothers? Did the youngest of thy sisters? Did the worst of all thy kindred?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Logic
<Reikim> 8grunt
<Bronysith> Freefall29: would you prefer the term indentured servant? or how about serf?
<otakon> Bronysith: he's not a slave, he's a baby dragon Twilight takes care of him
<Discord-Drocsid> Ditzy Doo? was that the nickname or the actual name in game?
<otakon> Discord-Drocsid: Nick I think
<Freefall29> Bronysith: but you say it every friggin time I bring up spike. I got it the last hundred times you mentioned it
<Bronysith> otakon: and he cant leave the house without her permission, and she doesnt even think him as a friend
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Technically, she always tells the truth, not senses it.
<otakon> BRONIES, why won't they leave us alone
<otakon> Bronysith: ofc she does and he has, remember Dragon Quest?
<Reikim> For the love of God, try to remember that Spike is a child.
<Bronysith> otakon: "before coming to ponyville Shining Armor is the only one i acceppted as a friend"
<chhchickenCX> These 2 girls laughed at my derpy drawing..
<otakon> Bronysith: she was a filly and that was BEFORE Spike became her assistant
<chhchickenCX> They dont lik eponies..
<otakon> Bronysith: A filly can't take care of a baby dragon
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also Rainbow Dash, Element of Loyalty, doesnt even stick with Twilight
<Freefall29> Bronysith: your right, letting a baby dragon who can't fight or defend himself on his own is a great idea
<Reikim> Bronysith: Spike is a bloody child. He's not a friend, he's a responsibility.
<Bronysith> otakon: before, she came to ponyville, Before ponyville
<Bronysith> otakon: thats 20 years of time
<JESmith71> Did the stream go out?
<Discord-Drocsid> GUYS!
<LadyCanary> Oh my god this sounds so familiar.
<RAWRity> Curses on thee, cruel iron! Curses on the steel thou givest! Curses on thee, tongue fo evil! Cursed be thy life, forever!
<RosePetal> Look at Filly Doctor Whooves.
<Discord-Drocsid> DOE IT FREAKING MATTER?
<AJIsAwesome> Discord-Drocsid: Yes?
<Bronysith> um guys, i think RAWRity is broken
<Reikim> I don't mind. His poetry is nice.
<otakon> Bronysith: yeah before Ponyville was her living in the Royal Palace learning magic from Princess Celestia
<AJIsAwesome> Discord-Drocsid: Not really, but I'm not going too far intot the debacles.
*Freefall29 pokes RAWRity with a stick
<DashWithRainbows> RAWRity was never fixed to begin with.
<otakon> RAWRity: why are you quoting what sounds like The Bard?
<Obsidian> Well thats it for me today. Goodnight everypony.
<Discord-Drocsid> RAWRity?
<Reikim> good point, DWR.
<Freefall29> bye bye Obsidian
<otakon> night Obsidian sleep well
<chhchickenCX> I have alot of bronies at my school <3:O;)
<weeping_pegasi82> does bronystate just play the music over and over again?
<Bronysith> Obsidian: night Interplay
<Glacymr> i can probably use the harddrive
<Glacymr> 500GB
<scout19_tf2> hey yo wuts up everypony
<RosePetal> Goodnigt Obsidian.
<AJIsAwesome> chhchickenCX: Nice.
<Bronysith> weeping_pegasi82: yes
<otakon> weeping_pegasi82: not usually but this is Vals personal playlist
<weeping_pegasi82> darn
<twilight_sprinkle> weeping_pegasi82: nah, the streamer just ran out of music
<otakon> it won't work
<RAWRity> otakon: it's from The Kalevala
<RosePetal> Aw no, Doctor Whooves wasnt captured.
<twilight_sprinkle> weeping_pegasi82: but there are songs that are played a bit too ften here imo
<otakon> RAWRity: never heard of it
<chhchickenCX> AJIsAwesome: Ikr
<Reikim> Val should add MAKINAIZE for ALL THE BADASS. Just saying.
<Kandarihu> Reikim, religion determines one's world view. Christianity reflects the enternal truth and love of God. If we were to simply compromise with the world too much, we can't honestly claim that we're following Christ.
<chhchickenCX> theres some people who dont like it..
<RosePetal> Yes!
<Sumica> 00,10So can you evlove sweetiebelle in to sweetiebot?
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Freefall29> why are talking about religion in a website about ponies?
<otakon> Kandarihu: please don't start that here.
<LadyCanary> OMG. Iknow what he should name the filly Doctor~
<RosePetal> I don't know. I don't know Ponymon.
<weeping_pegasi82> can we please just stop talking about religon?
<otakon> Freefall29: bc it comes up and Kandarihu is stopping now I think
<Discord-Drocsid> sweetie bell evolves into 2 forms
<Bronysith> damn you reddit, damn you i say
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Aint it weird how RD seems to be the least loyal pony with her friends?
<AJIsAwesome> Oh my gosh, What are we getting ourselves into? :D
<Kandarihu> otakon, Reikim asked a good question.
<Discord-Drocsid> crusader outfit and soemthign else
<scout19_tf2> hey yo wuts up everypony:)
<otakon> Caramel: Call him Tennant?
<Ponies47> Hey scout19_tf2
<AJIsAwesome> hi scout19_tf2 :)
<Freefall29> scout19_tf2: sup bro
<twilight_sprinkle> let the people have their discussion, it hasnt gone bad yet.
<otakon> hiya scout19_tf2
<RosePetal> lol it's the doctor.
<Glacymr> i just wish i had a way to wipe the data from it before plugging it in
<Bronysith> WHEN DOES the narwhal bacon?
<RosePetal> Or the doc.
<thelonepony> hi scout19_tf2
<chhchickenCX> omg this video is getting annoying!
<Discord-Drocsid> at midnigght
<weeping_pegasi82> caramel?
<Kinixys> Spike's ability to age and regress is rather odd. That brings to question whether they age normally at all.
<Kandarihu> It's still civil
<scout19_tf2> and wut r we watching today
<otakon> chhchickenCX: well turn the music down
<Freefall29> twilight_sprinkle: its gonna soon... someone is gonna say something stupid and a flame war will happen
<RosePetal> Ponymon.
<Discord-Drocsid> hello
<RosePetal> DINKY!
<Freefall29> Kinixys: he's gonna live hundreds of years old. it makes sense he ages slower
<Discord-Drocsid> @rosePetal
<otakon> Kinixys: I don't think ponies and dragons age like us at all it seems.
<chhchickenCX> I just want a dif. video but i guess ill wait:|
<twilight_sprinkle> Freefall29: there are barely any religious people here in the first place. plus mods can easily stop it if its out of control
<Reikim> Kandarihu: And you gave a good answer. Now I know why you took so long. Still, I disagree, but recognize that at this level it's an opinionated matter. I only object to your use of the term "Christianity" because that covers a very diverse range of beliefs.
<weeping_pegasi82> he could just run from the battles...
<scout19_tf2> where can u play dis
<AJIsAwesome> chhchickenCX: STream. Not video.
<otakon> Although the fact that if he starts hoarding he ages quicker but that seems to cause him to become more animalistic
<chhchickenCX> Yeah..
<Kandarihu> Freefall29, we can't live in fear of morons lest we be censored by their very existance.
<RosePetal> Well, you have to level up the ponies. The next gym leader has ponymon that are level 20.
<twilight_sprinkle> weeping_pegasi82: apparently grinding vies some sort of stat bonus. idk why he needs it in a game without multiplayer tho
<otakon> Kandarihu: only problem is the morons usually outnumber you.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: to make your ponies strong!
<Freefall29> kill the bitch
<weeping_pegasi82> kill it
<otakon> BEAT HER WITH BIG MAC!
<chhchickenCX> with fire
<SpadeMagnes[R]> BURN HER WITH HELLFIRE
<Reikim> Pokemon requires SO much grinding.
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I was actually wondering if he could control his aging if he could master his inner greed.
<otakon> and then he went away
<Bronysith> otakon: that sounds so wrong on so many levels
<chhchickenCX> With ectra fire!
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: maybe
<chhchickenCX> **extra
<twilight_sprinkle> im not a fan of the whole "people are morons" thing at all, because usually it just means that people have a different opinion from yours
<otakon> Bronysith: goddammit
*Bronysith gives otakon whiskey
<Bronysith> take a shot
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Theres opinion and then theres plain stupidity
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: he's gonna have to mature sooner or later, if he can control his dragon side is what matters
<Kandarihu> otakon, I understand. But cowering in fear of them isn't the right thing to do.
<RAWRity> I'm back
<Kinixys> Freefall29: Since greed triggers aging, will his body be stunted far longer than a one who lives with it's kin?
<RosePetal> Almost out of the cave.
<Freefall29> sup RAWRity
<twilight_sprinkle> i mean yeah people are morons, but everyone is a moron, usually when people say "people are stupid" they mean "people disgree with me"
<Reikim> Indeed, TS. There are very few morons. There is a lot of ignorance, and even more disagreement, but very little true, bigoted stupidity.
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome bacK RAWRity
<RosePetal> lol the irony.
<RAWRity> what's otakon cowering from?
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/RJodp.gif HOLY CELESTIA ON A UNICYCLE IT IS SWEETIE BELLE
<thelonepony> wb RAWRity
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: well let me put it this way, out of the BILLIONS of people that have been born, lived and died how many have actually improved our lot in life on a whole? The rare genius' which number maybe in the 1,000's in comparisons.
<scout19_tf2> dis remix stinks
<RosePetal> lol.
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: :D
<Freefall29> Kinixys: maybe he might age naturally, just won't be as powerful compared to other dragons.
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, having a different opinion is nothing wrong. I don't like it when they shove their views down my throat or accuse me of shoving my views down their throat just because I wanted to share mine.
<SirGanjalf> Sweetie Bear
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: AAAAAAAAAH! I'm so BORED
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: always cracks me up
<Caramel> 2,14 clearly scout19_tf2 has such a massive appreciation for Brony Appreciation Day
<otakon> lol maybe that's where they got the idea?
<Freefall29> Dark92Enigma: how can you bro bored bro
<Kandarihu> Oh, I just contradicted myself.
<Reikim> otakon: Implying that one needs genius to improve the human race. Or that not being a genius means you're automatically a moron.
<scout19_tf2> wait it really is carmel
<Dark92Enigma> Freefall29: i quoted Sweetie Belle
<Reikim> Really, ota, that entire bit was logically wrong.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I dont mind opinions but if their opinion is blatantly stupid then they're stupid
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: well i agree that the average person only cares about themselves. egoism is in our very core at this point in society, every person thinks about themselves 99% of the day. our society is Built on egoism, the belief that everyone is born with the right to anything they want
<Freefall29> I personally think religion and science goes hand in hand... in fact, I think some science is a product of religion.
*Reikim resists urge to turn this into a human nature discussion
<chhchickenCX> YES
<RosePetal> It depends, if their opinion has a lot of good factual evidence then it's fine. But if it has no evidence then it's just dumb.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: im ok with other opinions too. although logically speaking, there can only be one correct answer to a question
<otakon> Reikim: well let's put it this way, I'm smarter than a bug but Einstein is smarter than me. Compared to Einstein I'm a moron, compared to a bug I'm a genius. It's all about relativity.
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: not necessarily
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: exactly
<scout19_tf2> the remix just got 20% cooler
<weeping_pegasi82> caramel: let us choose!
<otakon> so
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, and that's why we debate. In persuit of the truth.
<RAWRity> otakon: technically, compared you Einstein, you're average.
<otakon> Octavia or Vinyl Scratch huh?
<Reikim> otakon: And there's a general scale that most people work on. Einstein is a genius; a bug is a bug; and you are an average person of average intelligence. Really, most people on this earth fall within that middling range.
<RosePetal> That means you can have Octavia?
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: yes necessarily. there is always only one full correct answer. if there are different ways to view something, then that should be included in the answer
<Ponies47> http://tinyurl.com/8o5u27p
<weeping_pegasi82> yep
<chhchickenCX> Gtg bye guys!:$
<Reikim> Octavia.
<Ponies47> Chat derp hold on
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: yeah thats why i like to express opinions
<thelonepony> bye chhchickenCX
<Freefall29> you can't create nothing from something. that's the problem with evolved small celled organism theory.
<Reikim> Octavis for all the class.
<RosePetal> lol.
<Sumica> 00,10this music......
<Freefall29> something from nothing
<otakon> Reikim: exactly, a world of averages living in a world made by genius'.
<Sumica> 00,10ah yeah
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Ponies47: XD
<otakon> Sumica: what is this?
<Sumica> 00,10Finalfantasy
<Ponies47> Confound LightIRC!
<Reikim> otakon: But average is not moron.
<otakon> Sumica: which one?
<scout19_tf2> da hell is dat music
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Eyes on Me yay~
<weeping_pegasi82> interesting song...?
<SirGanjalf> Ponies47: That ep need to be streamed
<Sumica> 00,10I want to say 8
<otakon> Sumica: WHICH ONE...maybe
<Caramel> 2,14 jesus scout, if you don't like the music, mute the fucking stream and shut the hell up
<Kandarihu> Heh. Classical CD. The other is some sort of Dubstep CD or something right?
<Sumica> 00,10might be 9
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Sumica yep its Eyes on Me
<RosePetal> Can't wait for season 3! Why it no come by sooner?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> FF8
<Freefall29> Caramel: :O
<otakon> Sumica: enope not it, I recognize that theme by heart
<Kandarihu> RosePetal, I hope to know that myself.
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: let's put it this way. You need to get up a mountain. There's any number of ways to get up to the top. You could climb. You could drive. You could ride a burrow. Plenty of answers, all of them correct.
<otakon> Freefall29: don't :O him, his stream and it's aggravating to hear about people complain about the content of your stream.
<scout19_tf2> the fuck did i ever do the remix just had a bad beggining
<yeyfluttershy> hi
<otakon> MEga Kick
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: like i said, there is only one Full COrrect answer. all of the methods should be included in the answer
<Reikim> I'm sensing a tradition with nightly chat activity here.
<otakon> gotta be AJ
<Ponies47> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Join the muffin side @_@
<RosePetal> Shame that they can't learn those moves.
<Kinixys> If there is more than one answer to a question, then the question was not specific enough.
<weeping_pegasi82> hail the muffin queen
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man i love this song :)
<superretroworld> MUFFINS
<RosePetal> lol growl .
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: you really have no idea how the world works, do you?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kinixys: well there are almost always different ways to see something
<otakon> what does TM mean ..oh yeah Technique Machine
<Jim> oh lawd

<Reikim> *Technical
<dynamo2814> darn my mother and her computer stealing ways....good night guys
<Freefall29> you wanna know the difference between cupcakes and muffins... nothing. a muffin is a bald cupcake.
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: why does everything that comes out of your mouth have to be so rude and condescending
<scout19_tf2> dam mothers
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: no that's Meanwhile
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: him too.
<Reikim> Aaand TS brings out the insults, and I'm done.

<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: why does everything you type here have to be naive and dismissive?
<otakon> BALD! MY EYES!
<Reikim> Manechat can hate itself on its own terms tonight.
<RosePetal> I wonder if one of the ponymon worlds will be Trottenton.
<Jim> o_o
*Bronysith murders Freefall29

<Freefall29> Sumica: that was a stand up comedy reference.... jim gaffigan....
<otakon> wait
<Jim> aaaaah, dat ping
<Reikim> Don't give us that look, you ought to know about this by now.
<otakon> how come R DASH is a Slowbro?
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: "naive" again, condescension. i didnt dismiss you, i listened to what you said and i answered. after that you just made it personal, theres nothing really to dismiss or not
<Sumica> 00,10yeah i know, and any baker will call that joke wrong
<Bronysith> Freefall29: Sumica is a baker, he knows what a cupcake and a muffin is
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :( song always makes me wanna shed tears of joy...so beautiful
<superretroworld> seinfeld: and whats the deal with baldness?
<RosePetal> It's a glitch.
<Kandarihu> Reikim, within Christianity, there are many denominations. The one thing that makes a Christian a Christian is recognizing Jesus as the son of God and accepting his sacrifice on the cross as the only way to spiritual salvation. The various denominations have various doctrines or focuses, but they all agree on Jesus.
<Freefall29> Bronysith: I was making a reference
<Bronysith> Freefall29: well it backfired
<Jim> From time to time mane chat gets too drama-ish
<Freefall29> Bronysith: aint my fault you didn't get the reference
<RosePetal> Oh yeah there's a rival battle on that bridge.
<Kinixys> twilight_sprinkle: If a question can be interpreted in different ways, then it was worded too ambiguously.
<scout19_tf2> where can u play dis at
<Reikim> "From time to time"
<Bronysith> Freefall29: um, i did get the reference, but no one found it amusing
<Bronysith> Freefall29: especially since there is a real baker in the chat
*Ponies47 Doesn't know why but he downloaded TF2 Beta
<RosePetal> Rare candy must of been hiding really quickly.

<oni_link> Bronysith: For a second I thought it was gonna be the Cheetahmen theme
<Reikim> Nowadays Canada is getting indistinguishable from the US anyway.
<Ponies47> DocSane: That's old news :(
<Jim> Silly american 'health care'

<DocSane> Ponies47: As I said, I only found out today.
<Reikim> Health care that Harper has been itching to ax for a looooong time.
<Ponies47> DocSane: I found out yesterday :(
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also linux always pay more in the humble bundles vause they always get games that are actualy playable on linux
<AJIsAwesome> Have some TF2. http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=255
<superretroworld> DAMMIT NC
<Freefall29> oni_link: you actully know about cheetamans sad, sad existance?
<Dken2021> will this hinder with that anniversarry thing?
<otakon> Wirisme: he said he'll do NC every once in a while but hes gonna stop doing regular eps of it
<DJ_POn-3> great to hear all um.... what is streaming i got the buffer show right now
<Dark92Enigma> superretroworld: no, i'm comparing examples from Pony.MOV and his review of Short Circuit........because i'm trying to find a song, but he does talk about us the bronies weeks ago
<RainbowDash90> the buffer show is awsome :)
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: :D LMAO
<DocSane> otakon: I'm actually impressed that he's trying to expand from the (rather stale) "Outraged fan review" format.
<otakon> DJ_POn-3: Val was streaming but he quit bc SOMEONE was complaining.
<Bronysith> gnight you crazy bastards
<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: what video, short circuit?
*Ponies47 Noms on a apple
<otakon> DocSane: yeah but NC makes me laugh.
<superretroworld> night Bronysith
<Dark92Enigma> otakon i know he likes it, and who can blame him? we all do!
<Freefall29> lets compared my little pony: friendship is magic to my little buffer: waiting is magic.
<Phase4> 00,02i also seriously question people who say linux isnt worth the effort to suport
<DJ_POn-3> otakon: about wut :P
<otakon> DJ_POn-3: the stream
<Princess_Cadence> -noms on some royal food-
<Dken2021> well, nice of doug to take a break once in awhile, his "reviews" are kinda getting a bit repetitive
<oni_link> Freefall29: Of course. I consider myself a connoisseur of all things Retro. LD
<Phase4> 00,02~ its 12% of the purchases
<oni_link> *:D
<DocSane> otakon: Well, you can have any of his 150 million copy cats to choose from.
<DJ_POn-3> otakon: was the stream bad or....
<Phase4> 00,02they PAY MORE than mac or windows users
<otakon> DocSane: like who? the only I know of is AVGN
<Dark92Enigma> superretroworld: yeah, to mock the ''iNDIAN Racist guy''
<Freefall29> oni_link: that, and there was the AVGN episode.
<otakon> DJ_POn-3: no it wasn't
<Phase4> 00,02and steam is heading to linux
<Freefall29> action 52 was an awesome episode.
<DocSane> otakon: Most of whom record shows consisting of a static camera locked in at too far away and giving us snide reviews, usually delivered by an obese neckbeard.
<oni_link> Freefall29: Yeah, but I learned about that song because of chiptunes :P so yeah
<otakon> DocSane: well NC is funnier dammit
<Freefall29> avgn vs NC. GO!
<AJIsAwesome> i like both.
<DocSane> otakon: Yes, he was. Although, truth be told, I'm more of a Lindsey Ellis fan at this point.
<Bronysith> i have to agree with otakon
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also http://www.indieroyale.com/
<BerryPunch> Title on www.indieroyale.com: The Back to School Bundle - Indie Royale

<oni_link> Im with ya AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> I prefer NC over AVGN, but I like both.
<otakon> enope
<Freefall29> Dken2021: I think the shooting is done. editing is left
<otakon> I like HVGN too
<otakon> He makes me happy
<DocSane> otakon: I like Nostalgia Chick's more analysis-based offerings.
<oni_link> lol
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Oh, DEFINITELY him.
<otakon> DocSane: yeah true
<Wirisme> I have to be in the mood to watch AVGN
<Wirisme> And it doesn't happen very often
<Freefall29> happy video game nerd gave earthbound a 20 minute episode.... I can respect him for that.
<DocSane> otakon: Does AVGN even do the AVGN stuff anymore?
<oni_link> I like Mikes stuff too
<superretroworld> Wirisme: sometimes i have to be in the mood to watch mlp

<AJIsAwesome> I have to be in the mood to watch Angry Joe.
<LadyCanary> He gives very blunt, honest reviews.
<otakon> lol LadyCanary you only like him for the jacket
<LadyCanary> Nahhhh.
<Freefall29> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ4AictvRdU

<Reikim> Bunny Must Die?
<DocSane> And I'm one of those odd people who really think that Nella is damn funny.
<otakon> and SUCH AN EPIC CLIMAX
<LadyCanary> But my new favorite reviewer? Diamanda the Lecher bitch Hagan <3

<otakon> but I think that's why we like you
<Freefall29> nintendo... y u no release earthbound in japan....
<LadyCanary> I really like her ^_^
<Kandarihu> For anyone who didn't understand my "Banning of Dihydrogen Monoxide" joke, http://www.snopes.com/science/dhmo.asp
<Reikim> But a good game all around.
<otakon> Kandarihu: you mean H2O?
<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: when does he mention the bronies?
<otakon> Kandarihu: aka water?
<Kandarihu> otakon, you got it right.
<otakon> yeah I get the joke
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome same here, even when i like both NC and AVGN i find myself more familiar with the former, because even if i did play some nostalgic videogames, i've watched more nostalgic shows
<otakon> kind of like how 78 out of 100 people asked on the street thought heterosexual was homosexual and vice versa
<pony_817> lol
<otakon> Little Nemo
<otakon> God I remember that game
<otakon> SO GODDAMN HARD

<DocSane> It's funny how Lindsey seems to studiously avoid talkign about FiM, except for one small mention.
<otakon> Why is YT loading so damn slowly for me?
<Glacymr> yes
<Wirisme> He also made a big deal about the gender thing
<Reikim> Sorry, my ISP cut out, I've been forced to route my connection through Otanet.
<Shizuka> 13are you still using neighbor wifi?
<oni_link> otakon: delete ALL THE COOKIES
<otakon> Shizuka: ...yes.
<Shizuka> 13that's why
<Glacymr> i give up
<DashWithRainbows> Because you hold internet that is crap otakon.
<Glacymr> i can't get the hard drive into my computer XD

<otakon> Shizuka: every thing else is loading fine BUT Youtube videos
<Jim|GW2> aaw shiet, frenchies are kicking our arse
<Glacymr> the power supply cord isn't agreeing with me
<Wirisme> I didn't see that, which part is it?

<Shizuka> 13youtube videos are substantially more content than pages
<DocSane> Wirisme: I can't remember. It was months and months ago.
<Wirisme> I'll just ctrl f the comments then lol
<DocSane> Wirisme: The question was "Twilight Sparkle or Rainbow Dash." He went on to give a hilariously detailed and well-argued answer.
<Wirisme> lol
<Buytoast> are these blue shift and opposing force games worth it or are they like the invisible wars of halflife?
<Wirisme> gotta see this
<Freefall29> DocSane: oh yeah.. that was funny
<otakon> Shizuka: how about just one that's embedded in another site?
<Shizuka> 13still youtube

<weeping_pegasi82> *sigh* can someone ping me when something happens please?

<CrimsonPhoenix> that was a nice quote at the end
<Reikim> Especially not the one that keeps this place functioning...
<CK|Catnap> Nittany: I'd like to believe that. But see, there's this "trend" at EA of studio heads leaving "on good terms" and all
<mitamaking> This is a decent episdoe
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> speaking of Bioware didnt they make ME3? If so,is the ending really THAT bad?
<otakon> missing kids?
<Skylands> 10You don't usually get paid for internships here
<CK|Catnap> And by trend I mean basically every studio
<twilight_sprinkle> its the magic pencil!
<otakon> oh GOD
<scout19_tf2> lets solve a mistery gang
<otakon> well that was horrifying
<weeping_pegasi82> oh YES

<Skylands> 10k
<Vordox> Phase4: Mmm?

<mitamaking> Nittany_Discord: And Microsoft killed Rare
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: and then shuts down the studios they buy
<Dken2021> btw, found this while lurking http://derpy.me/SnCsB

<otakon> Gundam 00
<CK|Catnap> Nittany: Actually in recent years they've cut more jobs than they created, IIRC
<derpy56> :$
<Reikim> Night Nitt.
<mitamaking> There is a bold rumor right now, Nintendo may buy Rare for the IPs
<JESmith71> My stream's derped then

<Phase4> ohai
<otakon> mitamaking: please PLEASE let them buy it

<Reikim> Good idea.
<scout19_tf2> boooooooooo government
<nickstr> it takes over a month

<AJIsAwesome> Gundam 00
<derpy56> dance dance dance corner pony >w<
<otakon> magmablock: it always does in Gundam series
<mitamaking> I think Rare is dead, but getting someone like Retro or Platinum on the Rare IPs...
<Reikim> ...ohgod they're watching Gundam
<Kandarihu> Well, Rare's moxy was running out before Microsoft bought them out.
<derpy56> the fuck
<CK|Catnap> Nittany: Oh, just a feeling.

<CK|Catnap> Oh, and this article.
<otakon> magmablock: think satellites that people live on.
<CK|Catnap> http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2012-04-16-report-ea-facing-up-to-1000-job-cuts
<weeping_pegasi82> I don't read japanese
<Nittany_Discord> Don't forget, we're in 8% unemployment and a terrible economy.
<Reikim> Gonna watch that one later.
<Nittany_Discord> So, yeah, jobs are going to be cut.
<Polydunami|HS> Well, I think I shall be busy with other things.

<Malk> ladyCanary If you have advice what order should I watch gundum?
<Barbetos> The whole gundam universe is hard to keep track of.

<Barbetos> I got myself into something crazy when I got into Gundam Wing. =P
<otakon> Malk: I suggest G Fighter Gundam myself, there are several series
<CK|Catnap> And they also closed one of their Bioware studios, too, as I recall.
<otakon> Barbetos: same here
<CK|Catnap> Part of an effort to consolidate IIRC.

<weeping_pegasi82> I usually like animes but I don't really like this one
<otakon> OR on his eye's
<otakon> weeping_pegasi82: it takes getting used to
<otakon> weeping_pegasi82: it's very philsophical

<Kencolt> Incomprehensible song incoming.
<mitamaking> Not Code Geass
<otakon> damn that's chump change in the grand scheme of things
<twilight_sprinkle> Yes code geass. best anime
<otakon> no
<otakon> no it's not
<twilight_sprinkle> is too
<otakon> Cowboy Bebop is that
<Malk> OH GAWD MY UNCLES RING TONE FOR 7 years
<Kandarihu> One Piece. Best anime, and it LASTS
<otakon> COWBOY BEBOP
<weeping_pegasi82> math?
<twilight_sprinkle> cowboy beepop? pfffnah
<otakon> Kandarihu: great show
<mitamaking> Go to my anime list . net and look up mitamaking, anything I rated a 9 or 10 is good
<otakon> One Piece is great
<thelonepony> ^
<otakon> No filler
<otakon> lots of interesting characters
<twilight_sprinkle> code geass has no filler either, every ep changes the story
<otakon> and fantastic action scense
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: Not like Cowboy Bebop, but like Code Geass, hahahahaha
<Kandarihu> Well, it DOES have filler, but it almost never gets out of hand
<weeping_pegasi82> I've watched Death Note, Ouran Host Club, and both FMA's(I just got into the anime game)
<NocturnalBlade> weeping_pegasi82: i heard Black Butler is a good one
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: oh please, deathnote fanboy
<Princess_Cadence> the random anime is over o3o
<otakon> Kandarihu: yeah but it's not pointless filler
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ah this old PMV
<Canadian_Brony> Hello everypony. Sumi's stream tonigh.
<otakon> Princess_Cadence: it was Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex
<Canadian_Brony> THIS
<NocturnalBlade> hi Canadian_Brony
<AJIsAwesome> Hi Canadian_Brony :)
<otakon> lol
<thelonepony> hi Canadian_Brony
<Wirisme> fuck yes
<Canadian_Brony> I approve of this PMV
<mitamaking> Your right, the show is better if we all worship Light twilight_sprinkle :)
<otakon> hiya Canadian_Brony
<weeping_pegasi82> hey Canadian_Brony
<Kandarihu> Well, there were those Grand Jipangu specials.
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: 1. light sucks 2. code geass is better
<OneTrickPony> o hai Canadian_Brony
<Canadian_Brony> I'll make a man out of you.
<Canadian_Brony> love this
<Jim|GW2> hai Canadian_Brony
<otakon> 42!
<mitamaking> 1.Lelouch is lame 2.Code Geass suffers because of it
<mitamaking> Let us not do this again
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: code geass wasnt even that interesting, i barely forced myself through the first 9 episdoes, and after L died it got very bad, with tons of plot holes
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: youre the one who started it
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Be a Mare!
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: spoilers man
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: what?
<Wirisme> Man I wanna watch Mulan now
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: the hell you should know better
<Malk> Wana Watch Mulan Now
<mitamaking> Mulan now
<otakon> no demands
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: i didnt complain about your choices, but you started going "codegeass sucks blabla ps.imadeathnotefanboy"
<Kandarihu> Uh, getting Death Note and Code Geass mixed up?
<Canadian_Brony> otakon but the true question is what is the ultimate question to the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything?
<Canadian_Brony> WELL?
<mitamaking> fine
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: 6x7 ofc
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon:
<weeping_pegasi82> twilight_sprinkle: you make no sense
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: still spoilers so don't even try it
<Canadian_Brony> HAX!!!!
<otakon> I KNOW ALL!
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: *sorry, didnt think anyone here currently would be interested in watching it anyway
<otakon> MUHAHAHAHAH
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: well no but spoilers are spoilers
<Malk> Candian_Brony because the main question is within reach but we cannot comprehend it
<Wirisme> The MOOOONNNA
<mitamaking> Be a man
*Sylandest has chills
<Canadian_Brony> otakon O RLY? What are my 3 aliases?
<twilight_sprinkle> weeping_pegasi82: death note fans hate code geass because they think code geass ripped of the main character, which is bullshit
<Kencolt> Code Geass interested me. I liked it. DeathNote, on the other hoof, bored me to hades.
<mitamaking> Mysterious as the dark side of the mooooooon
<OneTrickPony> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<Canadian_Brony> that was awesom
<Wirisme> (beeyetch)
<twilight_sprinkle> Kencolt: ikr. it wasnt even that clever
<weeping_pegasi82> twilight_sparkle: so which one was first?
<Kandarihu> You know what? I liked both Death Note and Code Geass
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: Woulda Shoulda and Coulda
<mitamaking> Teach English
<Wirisme> haha
<Wirisme> replace english with music
<otakon> lol
<Canadian_Brony> otakon . . . you don't know everything.
<twilight_sprinkle> the way light..did it, i thought of 10 episodes before he did, and nothing was stopping him from doing it earlier
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: blargh
<Malk> lol
<Canadian_Brony> hah
<AJIsAwesome> I like Code Geass and Death Note. I prefer Code Geass because it interested me more, but Death Note is still a good anime to me.
<Canadian_Brony> Stumped, eh
<twilight_sprinkle> weeping_pegasi82: doesnt even matter because theyre not the same
<Canadian_Brony> ?
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: eh I don't care
<mitamaking> Oh this is Avenue Z
<otakon> sounds about right for me
<mitamaking> *Q
<otakon> mitamaking: Avenue Q

<Cynder7> 6Hiya ^^
<lethal> What is this?
<AJIsAwesome> PMV
<otakon> THis must be the starting act

<AJIsAwesome> Can't remember the episode that made me a brony.
<otakon> You win
<otakon> I feel better
<otakon> XD
<mitamaking> Well I thought the show was weak early, then Flutterguy
<RaveBrony> This... is Amazing! :D
<Wirisme> Sonic Rainboom was my first episode
<Canadian_Brony> Watchu talkin' bout willis?
<Wirisme> so I guess that converted me
<otakon> I think my first ep was Party of One
<Sumica> 00,10I did't know what a brony was till I finished s1
<weeping_pegasi82> the song winter wrap up got me interested
<otakon> I found out about bronies on The Escapist
<RaveBrony> Sumica: Same! lol
<thelonepony> hurrincane fluttershy was my first episode
<mitamaking> Opening song?
<otakon> I asked why so many people had ponies as their avatar
<otakon> THE MOON!
<mitamaking> otakon: you fool
<Canadian_Brony> oh, I know this one . . .
<otakon> Oh God the nostalgia
<otakon> mitamaking: I know I know
<Kandarihu> Moonbase song
<Canadian_Brony> umm
<AJIsAwesome> Found about bronies via Know Your Meme episode.
<otakon> God I love this
<Kencolt> otakon: Well, watching a cute, candy-colored pony decsend into the depths of insanity will make anyone curious...
<otakon> hmm
<Malk> AJ Is Awesome
<otakon> So beautiful
<otakon> ;_;
<Wirisme> It was after Doug Walker mentioned them on his Q&A vid, so I decided to see what the fuss was about
<AJIsAwesome> To be honest, KYM didn't really give a good example of bronies.
<twilight_sprinkle> my friend kept linking me pony stuff, which surprised me because i didnt think he was into cute stuff. so i started watching from the beginning, so no first ep for me i guess. i almost quit after the 3rd ep too
<mitamaking> But of course Family Appreciation Day is there for our weekly CMC or Fluttershy episode
<NocturnalBlade1> and chat pulled a big ol derp on me!
<otakon> wb NocturnalBlade
<otakon> ahem NocturnalBlade1
<Canadian_Brony> I found out about bronies via DEATH BATTLE!!! and an awesome friend I didn't know was a brony until almost a year of knowing him.
<otakon> NocturnalBlade1: just ghost the old nick
<AJIsAwesome> Then I heard about them through a YTP news show that I used to watch.
<RaveBrony> I watched pony eps. Worried i was the only one. Looked up pony stuff. Found EqD. and it linked me here :D
<otakon> MORE GITS!
<thelonepony> moar GITS
<Malk> AJIsAwesome I became a brony by watching MLP with my 4 year old cusin she loves it a little more than me though
<NocturnalBlade1> otakon: how?
<mitamaking> twilight_sprinkle: I know that feel, I didn't watch any episodes for about 5 months between episode 2 and 3
<weeping_pegasi82> why
<RaveBrony> And i was welcome by many when i got here! Most of which are gone now.... :(
<otakon> NocturnalBlade1: /msg nickserv ghost (nick) (password)
<RaveBrony> *welcomed
<Kandarihu> IIRC, my first brony encounter was watching the first annual Indie Games for Good marathon. The guys there were bronies. However, I might've known about this since earlier.
<otakon> RaveBrony: not really
<mitamaking> EQD got me here too
<NocturnalBlade1> otakon: i dont think i have a password XD
<otakon> yeah EqD got me here too
<Canadian_Brony> then last April, I watched all of Season 1 in a single school night.
<otakon> NocturnalBlade1: well hold on
<twilight_sprinkle> mitamaking: yeah they were very predictable, especially the 3rd one, 30 seconds in i knew what would happen, how, and the ending
<RaveBrony> otakon: Well, they dont chat in 'here' anymore. I know where they went :D
<AJIsAwesome> My response to the fandom kept switching from negative to neutral as I saw the fandom grow. I even saw some of my favorite video games sped run by bronies.
<otakon> ah
<flutter_spin> just in time for Ghost in the Shell
<Kencolt> Me? I just noted articales, and memes, and stuff... and I had the HUB, on my cable, so I decided to give it a chance. After a couple of days, I heard most eps were on YouTube. After that, well... no going back.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Welp, im off to Minecraft with a RL friend of mine
<Discord-Drocsid> I WONDER
<Canadian_Brony> And that's how Pinkie Pie got her cutie mark! Maybe someday I'll tell you how I became a brony
<otakon> indeed hiya flutter_spin
<NocturnalBlade1> hi flutter_spin

<Discord-Drocsid> why doesnt John De lnacy come as well
<otakon> Discord-Drocsid: nice
<Discord-Drocsid> *lancy
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, there was an AMV Hell Minis episode dedicated to western animation. There were some FiM clips from there, and I was only recently aware of the brony movement back then.
<OneTrickPony> hiya flutter_spin imma go read that some time soon
<otakon> Discord-Drocsid: bc he's a guest star

<Discord-Drocsid> i bet he will make a SURPRISING appearance
<flutter_spin> lol. cache... is that you cache?
<mitamaking> Wait, I thought the helicopter episode was in season 2
<otakon> Discord-Drocsid: who knows maybe
<Discord-Drocsid> right when the main panel is going on
<Wirisme> Wow my story is lame.. "I decided to check it out and I liked it"
<Wirisme> :(
<otakon> DAMN
<otakon> holy shit
<NocturnalBlade> Wirisme: its ok *hug*
<Malk> Wirisme not as lame as me watching with my cusin

<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Wirisme> That's pretty cool though Malk :)
<mitamaking> Is this the Saito episode?
<otakon> Machine's Desires?
<flutter_spin> My mom just got home after traveling to Florida and New York

<Sumica> 00,10tachicomas up to no good
<otakon> flutter_spin: long time
<flutter_spin> Canadian_Brony: yep
<thelonepony> Spider tanks :3
<AJIsAwesome> I went through something very drastic that kept me in a dark depression a while back, and out of curiosity (and guilting myself), I decided to give the show a chance. However, I didn't watch every episode in one night like most people did. It took me about a week t finish all the episodes and by the time Mystery On th Friendship Express came out I loved the show.
<Kandarihu> mitamaking, yes, it's this episode.
<mitamaking> The 25 minutes of Tachcoma talk
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: it helped didn't it?
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Yep. :D
<shibaru> This guy just keeps somehow crawling back into my life when I think I've escaped
<mitamaking> running now
<flutter_spin> otakon: Yeah. Why am I not surprised she tells me to hold onto the bills until money comes in.
<mitamaking> If you thought you hated this show before...
<Kimori> someone you know?
<otakon> I gotta admit if not for MLP I'd be a lot more depressed and melancholy
<mitamaking> otakon: MLP got me through my exams last semester
<shibaru> Yea
<Canadian_Brony> if not for MLP I'd be a total dick
<otakon> since atm I'm out of work and no luck finding a job
<flutter_spin> otakon: I'm not sure. I really like the community and projects that come up related to mlp. The show is more of an attachment, like me watching Dr. Who right now
<thelonepony> Mlp got me out of my depression
<otakon> hmm
<mitamaking> Canadian_Brony: So like you are now?
<otakon> that thing?
<mitamaking> :p
<AJIsAwesome> If it wasn't for this show I would've been MUCH MORE depressed than I usually was. I would've probably been in a mental hospital.
<AJIsAwesome> :$
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Wirisme> MLP always cheers me up
<Princess_Cadence> -pokes the chat randomly-
<Kimori> online?
<thelonepony> Adorable :3
<NocturnalBlade> I dont think i would have the girlfriend i have right now if not for FiM
<Malk> Wirisme I just like kids im not in a sick way
<flutter_spin> wait, isn't this the episode entirely devoted to the tanks AI?
<AJIsAwesome> Princess_Cadence: OW!

<Wirisme> 3.14159265358979323846264338 is all I remember
<Kimori> Which messenger is this on?
<Wirisme> I probably got some of it wrong too
<flutter_spin> whoa! http://gordanfreeman17.deviantart.com/art/MLP-FIM-Clock-291983194 I want that clock
<twilight_sprinkle> 3.14 is all i bothered to remember
<Canadian_Brony> mitamaking . . . very funny. I mean I'd be almost completely anti-social and a not as close to my sister than I am today. In other words, I'd be a stereotypical teenager.
<otakon> mitamaking: well as far as I know the first three numbers are always 3.14 and the rest of the numbers are usually random

<AJIsAwesome> My older brother (whos a non-brony) is considering attending a brony conventions. :$
<Canadian_Brony> ohai Shizuka
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i dont think its random
<otakon> Shizuka: you lack a Ghost?
<NocturnalBlade> i hear Kari!!
<mitamaking> Shizuka: I know that one, False
<otakon> me too
*Shizuka 13ist just an idea
<otakon> oh the bookworm
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: oh, or do you mean you just wrote random
<otakon> Shizuka:
<mitamaking> I like the smart one
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: I wrote random
<twilight_sprinkle> okay
*otakon passes his hand through Shizuka
<NocturnalBlade> of course the smart one is voice by Kari :D
<otakon> Paper medium
<Kimori> With Skype you can change your privacy settings to only get messages from people on your contact list
<RaveBrony> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> show off robot.
<dr-whooves127> oh snap i know that voice
<otakon> it's Kairi
<mitamaking> So a good story, that is not a novel but a short story
<otakon> from Digimon
<Kimori> for MSN I know there is an option to only allow your own contacts to send you messages
<RaveBrony> Wuut
<RaveBrony> Oh, lol
<Kimori> If they arent on your list they cant message you
<mitamaking> Flowers for Algernon :( :( :'(
<Malk> These Robots are Trolls
<RaveBrony> Never watched Digimon...
<RaveBrony> :(
<otakon> Miki yes you would forget her
<Kimori> I don't use Gaia so I don't know what options are available for that
<Kandarihu> Poor Miki
<Malk> Such Intelegent Trolls
<Jim|GW2> Digimon was da bomb
<VenHur> The sheeps need me, I must depart to sleep!
<Sumica> 00,10Ruki is also otakon
<Wirisme> digimon adventure was my childhood
<NocturnalBlade> loved Digimon!
<otakon> Sumica: wait what?
<Sumica> 00,10from tamers
<otakon> ah
<Canadian_Brony> oh, I thought it asked what a lie was. When it comes to lies, I'm as easy to see through as Coca-Cola
<RaveBrony> O_o
<mitamaking> Stupid hive mind developing individuality
<otakon> So they're Geth?
<otakon> They're Geth
<Canadian_Brony> okay
<mitamaking> Now he is good

<otakon> Sumica: is the Major's most likely
<shibaru> Yea, but somehow he magically still talks to me. it's really fucking weird
<NocturnalBlade> i found the pinkie bot :D
<Kimori> If he is then you didnt set the settings correctly
<twilight_sprinkle> nothing like that feeling when you see that your homework isnt actually due tomorrow
<Malk> THank Gawd they dont know what a strike is
<mitamaking> :( <----Later
<Kimori> Ive changed the settings myself before to block some people from messaging me
<Wirisme> twilight_sprinkle: the gift of time!
<Canadian_Brony> "Don't think about your target"
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: eeyup
<Malk> GLock
<Canadian_Brony> that is terrible advice
<Kimori> For MSN there should be an option to Only allow your contacts on your buddy list to message you
<otakon> They feel sorry for it I think
<Kimori> If the guy is on your contact list after you change it then delete his name
<Kimori> dont block him, just remove the name
<RaveBrony> Well, bed time. Good night everypony! Take care :)

<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka I gave up trying at the mention of 0 as a concept

<otakon> Also don't think I could hate the Mary Sue models either
<dr-whooves127> take ove the world

<Shizuka> 13and then they go full retard
<otakon> Beep Boop Son
<otakon> Beep BOOP
<flutter_spin> lol. the marry sue models you call them?
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Kandarihu> Mary Sue?
<otakon> flutter_spin: well I don't know what their real model name is
<Jim|GW2> You never go full retard
<otakon> Kandarihu: generic character
<Shizuka> 13BUSTED
<Canadian_Brony> Mary Sue . . . reminds me of my first fan-fic. Holy crap that sucked
<Phase4> 00,02what am i watching

<Kandarihu> otakon, but a character who is implausibly perfect.
<flutter_spin> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> cmon, pokerface,pokerface
<Canadian_Brony> too robotic
<otakon> Kandarihu: ah well I got the usage wrong
<flutter_spin> pfffft
<mitamaking> Still working on the paradox
<Canadian_Brony> weird
<Buytoast> so do they hate the spiderbots or something?
<NocturnalBlade> naaaailed it lol
<otakon> Buytoast: no they're worried about them becoming sapient
<Lonko> Pinkie Pie tanks
<twilight_sprinkle> 2 days later: im afraid i cant do that, Major
<flutter_spin> They are learning. Fear them.
<mitamaking> This is why she is against them right here
<Kandarihu> Chitti's take on God is more sensible than the Tachikomas.
<otakon> hmmm
<NocturnalBlade> robot can read lips...seems legit
<flutter_spin> ^^
<flutter_spin> she knows.
<Shizuka> 13SPOI ROUND HERE
<otakon> ofc she knows
<otakon> she's the Major
<Ponies47> Moo ^.^
<otakon> Moo
<flutter_spin> I like cheese.
<Malk> DAVE
<twilight_sprinkle> Woo
<Kimori> Did it work?
<shibaru> No
<Kimori> :(
<Maid_RainBow> i have to go everypony
<Malk> Im watching Dave
<dr-whooves127> hal 9000
<otakon> bye Maid_RainBow take care
<NocturnalBlade> bye Maid_RainBow
<Canadian_Brony> seeya Maid_RainBow
<twilight_sprinkle> Tachikoma, open the pod bay doors!
<Ponies47> Bye Maid_RainBow
<Jim|GW2> bai Maid_RainBow
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Maid_RainBow
<Kimori> Too bad I can't see your screen
<otakon> saying one thing and thinking another
<otakon> sly woman
<Shizuka> 13hey.. i'm not beating them up on the sly anymore >>
<Sumica> 00,10I could never do that
<thelonepony> bye Maid_RainBow
<Lonko> But - but with their minds they could talk MUCH faster
<otakon> Sumica: me neither I don't think
<Sumica> 00,10would need a computer brain
<flutter_spin> :(
<mitamaking> Yay!!!
<otakon> Lonko: yeah but it only goes as fast as the circuits can process
<twilight_sprinkle> i think i can do it to a small extent
<Shizuka> 13it's probably fairly simple for the major, build what you want to say, swap out some words, send one string to your mouth, the other to the comm
<otakon> now if the Tachikoma is really smart
<Lonko> otakon: They have artificially enahcned brain process function
<otakon> Shizuka: well she IS The Major I'm surprised you don't like her more.
<flutter_spin> Shizuka: don't forget. She can dive while driving a car.
<Shizuka> 13the tachikoma probably doesn't know that room is so shielded, or else doesn't think that's a factor
<Phase4> 00,02Comrads
<Shizuka> 13awwwwwww i missed the chat episode?
<flutter_spin> yeah
<Shizuka> 13i love that one
<otakon> Shizuka: I don't think so
<SaxyPretender> 0,14still never really understood why the Tachikomas had to get lobotomised...
<mitamaking> The chat episode is cool
<flutter_spin> totally
<otakon> a'ww and then Batou feels like shit
<Lonko> I wonder why they never did a proper 3rd season
<mitamaking> Now this part is kind of sad
<mitamaking> Lonko: Some day
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: the one where they were talking about the murderer? dont know if that was streamed today, but it was stream a while ago
<otakon> SaxyPretender: they can't have weapons with free will
<Malk> Its like killing children
<Princess_Cadence> hmm whats on next xP
<Malk> WHy Batou Must we kill our children?
<Shizuka> 13SaxyPretender: they're weapons first, AIs second, so because they're developing AI stuff too fast and thinking about non-weapon things, there's a risk they'll think about death when they need to be thinking shoot this guy
<Wirisme> You can't grammar like that music.
<otakon> SaxyPretender: would you want a nuclear bomb to decide which targets it should take out and it decides WE'RE the threat.
<mitamaking> Lonko: The director has said within the last year, he will do it someday, he is doing Re:Cyborg 009 now though
<Shizuka> 13not that, the dumb AI of the sniper thing was getting there, but the tachikomas genuinely like their humans
<otakon> coool
<AJIsAwesome> mitamaking: He is?
<AJIsAwesome> YES!
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVED CYBORG 009!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I suppose so, I'm guessing dumping the AI core somewhere else with no access to military systems wouldn't fly in this universe?
<twilight_sprinkle> SaxyPretender: have you ever seen the space odyssey 2001? its basically a classical robot goes nuts and disobeys orders thing
<otakon> Shizuka: Poor Sniper Kun
<mitamaking> Don't get your hopes up, it may happen, it may not
<Kandarihu> REALLY? A 3rd Gig of GitS SAC?
<Shizuka> 13not as good as squishy

<Phase4> 00,02also, for the next time i stream: http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/ download the demo or get the full game, build rockets, i'll fly em on stream
<Phase4> 00,02the more insane the better
<Canadian_Brony> Fishing is for those who cant drik
<Buytoast> SmA@gol?

<dr-whooves127> wait what?
<Ponies47> Well time for bed everypony. Good night everypony :)

<Shizuka> 13KMPlayer thinks they're ASCII when they're unicodes
<Malk> AJIsAwesome it annoys me many times

<Shizuka> 13yeah doesn't seem to be a way to set it to unicode
<Wirisme> night ponies47
<PillowPoni> night, Ponies47
<dr-whooves127> mst3k?
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, why dont things just assume everything is utf-8 unless it finds evidence otherwise
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 challenge accepted. Tomorrow, I will make crazy shit that (hopefully) fies
<Shizuka> 13iunno
<Canadian_Brony> *flies
<Shizuka> 13ascii is so simple though
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Ponies47
<Shizuka> 13take one byte, interpret char
<Shizuka> 13unicode is like take one byte... or two... or four..
*kirzstryfe hugs Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13anyway back to code
*Shammy boops kirzstryfe
*Canadian_Brony throws a muffin at Shammy
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, utf-8 is variable length, first 127 codepoints are the same as ascii and take one byte
<Shizuka> 13e accent must not be in there, or else everyone that uses e accent uses something further up
<Shizuka> 13cause it's always the simple accented characters that trigger encoding bugs
<Malk> Precious
<Shizuka> 13based on the novel Push by Sapphire, which was also made into a movie
<Canadian_Brony> he disapoofe
<Canadian_Brony> *disapoofed
<NocturnalBlade> sushi
<weeping_pegasi82> yum
<Canadian_Brony> so quiet suddenly
<Phase4> 00,02wait, cant the bad guy talk to him through that ring?
<RAWRity> man, Smeagol's looking rough
<thelonepony> Eww
<weeping_pegasi82> ugh
<Canadian_Brony> everypony's become entranced by the stream
<Shizuka> 13i think the idea is the one ring is basically sauron's horcrux
<Buytoast> i don't think sauron is wake yet or something
<Shizuka> 13so exerts influence but isn't like a direct conduit
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, it's something like that
<Buytoast> either that or the ring is just saying fuck you ya greasy ol slobberknocker
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, true but how long has golum been around with the ring?
<Shizuka> 13i forget
<Buytoast> like 500 years
<RAWRity> Shizuka: more or less, yes. And it fills everyone with a near irresistable thrist to posses it.
<Phase4> 00,02its some absurd number
<SaxyPretender> 0,14though one can claim the power of the ring for themselves, and then....
<weeping_pegasi82> hundreds of years I think
<Canadian_Brony> a long time
<Phase4> 00,02Buytoast, sounds right
<Shizuka> 13yeah 500 sounds right, somewhere between 3 and 5
<Phase4> 00,02surely he could have influenced gollum to bring him the ring
<Malk> Precious
<Phase4> 00,02i meen if the big evil guy wants to be an idiot and loose i'm not complaining
<Shizuka> 13having not read the proper books i wonder if the killing of smaug was the catalyst that brings sauron back to power
<RAWRity> Phase4: it doesn't really do that. Just makes EVERYONE want it. It's a metaphor for the corruption of ultimate power.
<Malk> Mid day?
<Malk> SILLY
<SaxyPretender> 0,14don't think that's the case
<Shizuka> 13actually
<RAWRity> Shizuka: I haven't read the Silmarilion, so I'm not sure.
<Malk> LIAR
<Shizuka> 13the opening cinematic from fellowship notes the ring decided to leave gollum, but bilbo intercepted it
<Moopy> hey everypony whats up
<RAWRity> don't recall it being mentioned in the books.
<Canadian_Brony> I didn't read the books. I never plan on reading the books. And now my school has started a J. R. Tolkien club
<Malk> MOOPY WOOPY HI
<thelonepony> hi Moopy
<Shizuka> 13so might just have been that sauron slowly built up prior to the hobbit, the ring was ready to go but got stuck
<Moopy> hey dude
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, fun fact for those who don't know, but Sauron actually works for something much bigger than he
<Canadian_Brony> h Moopy. WAZZUP
<Moopy> wazzup dude
<weeping_pegasi82> hey Moopy
<Buytoast> been about 5 years since i reead the hobbit
<Moopy> hey weeping
<Spectrum_Rush> SaxyPretender: Morgoth?
<Shizuka> 13lord of the rings is horribly dense... tolkien needs to learn about paragraph breaks
<Phase4> 00,02speaking of which, any news on the hobbit movie?
<RAWRity> Buytoast: well now you cant just wait to watch the movies
<SaxyPretender> 0,14think so, Spectrum_Rush
<Buytoast> eh
<kirzstryfe> Sauron is mentioned in passing in The Hobbit, as "a dark force growing at the southern end of Mirkwood"
<Shizuka> 13also yes rawr this is the normal version, i don't have any of the extendeds
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, he needs to learn to not have prologs that could form stories on their own
<weeping_pegasi82> Shizuka: you should try the unabridged version
<RAWRity> Phase4: well, the comic-on exclusive footage leaked, and there's a trailer due out today.
<Canadian_Brony> Moopy you know, watching the stream and nomming a muffin.
<Buytoast> i'll probably see em 10 years after they come out
<Buytoast> like i did with these films
<RAWRity> *comic-con
<Moopy> hehehehe thats good
<Adjeca> my mum grabbed a damp cloth she forgot about since sunday and started wiping the counters with it
<Cades[Phone]> XD
<Adjeca> out came hundreds of teeny tiny mosquitos
<Moopy> Ahh lord of the rings good movie its always good
<Kimori> omg
*Spectrum_Rush to find out about Sauron during the hobbit, look up The Necromancer
<Canadian_Brony> "Young"
<Adjeca> i'm a mass murderer
<RAWRity> Spectrum_Rush: which is going to be covered in the Hobbit movies, apparently
<Canadian_Brony> but he is a tree, so . . .
<weeping_pegasi82> my sister watched the extended version and then the extended version WITH the commentary the whole thing
<Shizuka> 13the upper decker thing must be a reference i don't get
<Cades[Phone]> i would freak out if that happened
<Shizuka> 13unless it's something simple like stuffing a toilet with toilet paper
<Adjeca> haha
<Spectrum_Rush> RAWRity: yeah, the extra exhibitions is why the The Hobbit is a trilogy now
<RAWRity> I know.
<Shammy> I AM WISE

<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: nothing good can happen.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Duly noted

<RAWRity> for OUR sakes.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Any other words of advice?
<Ninjazz> You make us proud, Saxy.
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: Also, if you plan on taking a walk in the woods, take $20 with you.
<Shizuka> 13and if you wake up on a blooded beach with said german redhead
<Lonko> German RedheAD???
<Shizuka> 13don't try to choke her or she'll kill you
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: CONGRATULATIONS!
<Lonko> I'm german, so german Readheads concern me
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SaxyPretender: Kangaroos cant jump backwards
<Spectrum_Rush> SaxyPretender: I have one... just can't say it in chat though :S
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Why would I choke someone?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: maybe. Sort of. We're not entirely sure on that one.
*DaringDerpy is a german redhead
<kirzstryfe> Shizuka, have they release Eva Rebuild 3 yet?
<Shizuka> 13supposedly out this fall, but if rebuild 2 is anything to go by we won't see the dvd til next year at best
<kirzstryfe> :(
<Lonko> Are these commentators coming up with those lines on the go or are these cut together
<DaringDerpy> canned material
<kirzstryfe> Lonko, it's live
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: in fact, stay away from Subways.
<Lonko> kirzstryfe: Somehow I would doub that
<Shizuka> 13i assume they record it all at once, but some of it is probably planned beforehand
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...but I have to the train to school!
<JESmith71> Lonko: They're working from a script
<Shizuka> 13i saw a behind the scenes of mst3k once and they watch the movie a couple times to work out where the best jokes would go
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: ...you poor bastard.
<Shizuka> 13for timing and such
<Polydunami|HS> Thank you, Global.
<Lonko> You can come up only with so many witty lines. Not even Aaron Sorkin could pull that off
<SaxyPretender> 0,14CHris COrnell? <3
<RAWRity> Shizuka: have you ever seen the live MST3Ks they do?
<Shizuka> 13nope
<RAWRity> they're pretty neat.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, A BORIA TOWER HAS BEEN DESTROYED
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: If you see a blonde kid, a redhead, a man with a limp, and a dog walking along the tracks, IGNORE THEM.
<Moopy> So that means were gonna go with out stuff?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14see..
<Polydunami|HS> Is this the theatrical or the extended version? Just a small wonder.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14funny you mention that, aji

<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, iirc, you guys went to the Conference finals
<Barbetos> FistFullOfQuarters See, I say the same thing, but the sad thing is that the only way for this to be true, is that we have to throw all those good things into a capsule, send it into space, and blow up the earth. That is the ONLY way the will cease to exsist.
<FistFullOfQuarters> Barbetos: We need to live on Mars. Curiosity can be our president.
<Barbetos> Unless some one.. already sent the crappy stuff into space too.
<FistFullOfQuarters> Just don't bring any cats, Curiosity hates cats.
<RAWRity> Well, I've got to head to bed. S'been fun. Danku for stream Shizu

<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, Shizuka, sinfest
<Lonko> RAWRity: He could have. After that Mordor business.
<FistFullOfQuarters> Screw Honor

<Shizuka> 13:3
