<CECtheRonin> So is Cadence Luna's daughter... and a cougar?
<CCCP> Ads are evil
<Ninjazz> GilDash: What do I have to worry about?
<Lil_B> 3D Shows kkinda have a reputation of beeing bad, there aren't much that are good
<dishwasher_EXTREME> what are we watching
<RaveBrony> dishwasher_EXTREME: Ponies on the hub
<CCCP> dishwasher_EXTREME: capitalism
<alexxm> hey dishwasher_EXTREME hows your day been
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I don't know. But you *are* worried, so... :(
<Lil_B> dishwasher_EXTREME commercials

<Sumica> 00,10what does it take to be a hero? around 12 bucks a month
<rdibp> is anyone going to watch toonami tonight?
<Sylandest> Sumica: too expensive XD
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I told you I'm not worried... Apparently, I'm pissed off.
<Kandarihu> Where I live, the only cable TV is Comcast and the same company that does my Fiber Optic internet.
<TheRainbowDash> Now 20% cooler.
<RaveBrony> Now 20% Cooler? :o
<rdibp> 20% cooler
<RaveBrony> No way :D
<XAX> Saturn: When your real life friends have problems, do they hook up with Saturn?
<TheRainbowDash> Good addition to that commercial.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Apparently? You mean you don't know?
<Lil_B> CECtheRonin I have never seen this one
<Litwick> Ever notice ow SA is wearing the same tux as Prince Wiliam?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ohh the finale again?

<Litwick> Well they did say ROYAL Canterlot Wedding.
<CECtheRonin> Lil_B It's on Cartoon Network at about 10 PST.
<rdibp> andrew francis is best pony
<GilDash> Twi_Fi: That's the complete opposite of what I'm trying to do...
<Kandarihu> Hmm, Shining Armor's magic is red. And there's more blue than red on his cutie mark.
<Litwick> So of course they have to go with a ROYAL attire.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Look... I've on the verge of screaming at something that won't scream back. I just don't... know.
<Dark92Enigma> EVILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!
<Welsh_Pony> Evil!
<RaveBrony> Eeevviiiiilll!!
<Twi_Fi> GilDash: :O
<Litwick> Mermaid Man: EVIL!
<Dark92Enigma> Every Villain is Lemons
<NeonBlitz13> Personally, this is my favorite episode of bridezillas
<rdibp> im so glad they brought toonami back
<dishwasher_EXTREME> damn right girl
<RaveBrony> Luna!!
<CECtheRonin> Seems legit.
<Lil_B> CECtheRonin I have no CartoonNetwork in Germany, unfortunatly
<Dark92Enigma> LUNA AGAIN
<CCCP> Ninjazz: ummm what is going on?
<GilDash> Twi_Fi: *That* is also not what I'm trying to do. :D
<RaveBrony> Luna, why you no help more? :'(
<Malavolent> Ignored Luna is ignored.
<Obsidian> Listen to lua
<TheRainbowDash> Dashie in her dress...:)
<Obsidian> *Luna
<RaveBrony> Dat Fluttershy :D
<Alchemist> what? Pony stream at this time?
<rdibp> i love it when ponies get a big grin on their faces
<Dark92Enigma> LUNa's warning would be more effective with a gatling gun
<CECtheRonin> Lil_B Shame. It should be online somewhere.
<CCCP> rdibp: me too
<TheRainbowDash> That face of Twilight.
<Dark92Enigma> even more effective, btw
<Sumica> 00,10that look on twi's face take on a whole new meaning when you realise fluttershy just flashed Twi
<rdibp> AJ LIE FACE!!!!
<Sylandest> Sumica: wait-what?!
<Kandarihu> I guess my theory holds magi... er, water. That the magic can be any color on the cutie mark, but doesn't have to be the prodominant color.
<Twi_Fi> Hello Alchemist

<Bronysith> Rain: you have a lot to think about
<dishwasher_EXTREME> not anymore
<Airpuff> rdibp: indeed..

<TheRainbowDash> Tune in next week for part 2.
<|Discord|> Time to give up and eat hay
<Lil_B> I miss Tori Spelling in there....
<Kandarihu> I guess it's because Celestia either suspects or knows something is wrong with Cadence, but investigating this requires MUCH more subtlety than what Twilight Sparkle showed.
<CCCP> well nye evrypone :'(
<rdibp> even the hub admits it\
<Twi_Fi> Kandarihu: I was thinking the same thing.

<dishwasher_EXTREME> no
<Sumica> 00,10might be a thing at least so long as people want to watch ponies and aquabats
<Lil_B> Alchemist I can't quite explain... I need to learn how to work in a laboratory and a lot of theory of chemistry, before i can get a job
<Malavolent> I wonder how old Chrysalis is.
<rdibp> WHO WOULDNT WANT TO WATCH PONIES OR AQUABATS?
<NeonBlitz13> I am ALWAYS up for aquabats
<Dark92Enigma> HADOU-KEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Kandarihu> Well, the anti-bronies certainly wouldn't want to watch ponies. And there's still a limitation to the Aquabats appeal too.
<NeonBlitz13> sylandest- lol
<Airpuff> Daaw...
<Sumica> 00,10but seeing as ponies is on right before new eps of aquabats

<Welsh_Pony> Hope we get another villain song in season 3
<dishwasher_EXTREME> i dont sing it at all !!!lol
<Princess_Molestia> Hello everypony.
<Kandarihu> rdibp: you didn't ask who HERE wouldn't want to watch ponies. You asked who, without any modifier.
<Chrysalis> CECtheRonin cause they have nothing better to do with their lives
<Alchemist> Lil_B: it is a great thing you do. Im at uni and Im being bombarded with useless stuff. Sure Im in labs a lot but the equipment is archaic, so I dont get that much useful experience...
<RaveBrony> CECtheRonin: Wtf? Bronies?? Where? :[
<Lil_B> Alchemist I really don't know how to explayn this, sorry
<Kandarihu> Dat painful rhyme

<Lil_B> Her voice is Golden O.O

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Fans initially scoffed when they heard that Jaden Smith was playing the Daniel-san replacement, accusing Will Smith of nepotism. Many also forgot that Jackie Chan can play a dramatic role rather well. Both performances received great praise.

<grovyleshy_wood> OKAY. WHY ARE THEY MOVING TO CHINA? Is there a reason?
<derpy_pony> Did they ever say wtf she wants in Beijing?
<FlavinBagel> Do I?
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The American title for this film was kept as "The Karate Kid", to maintain the connection to the earlier films it is loosely based on, even though this movie takes place in China and the martial arts used are forms of kung fu. The difference is referenced in the film when Dre's mother describes a team as practicing karate, and Dre quickly corrects her.
<Meanwhile> grovyleshy_wood: She'd be Pinkie. And she'd speak Chinese.
<WallDives> Memme, I'm the oldest of 7...and my mom doesnt care.
<SirGanjalf> What i don't like about that film, is that franchise exploit(Why the didn't just called it "Kung-fu Kid"?). Besides that, it's OK
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Beverly Hills? lol

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In China, it's called "åå¤«æ¢¦" ("The Kung Fu Dream"); in Japan, and South Korea, it's called "Best Kid" (the same title that was used for the original movie in those countries), and "The Karate Kid" everywhere else.
<derpy_pony> they tried to make some cash from the fame of the other movie, Silverscreen...bought the license or something
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Electricity card?...Credit cards?....never heard of 'em :I
<Kandarihu> So this movie is filmed in Hong Kong, which flourished under capitalism while the U.K. owned it. It's set in Beijing.
<SirGanjalf> Wast that a Mr. Miyagi cameo? :O

<owlicious> always strong
<Saturn> 08,01for posture, strength, and weight
<owlicious> Saturn: O.O
<Yahooz> Dken2021: yeah. I did Tae Kwon Doe for 10 years. I would know XD
<WallDives> GilDash|Dinner, of course they were all mute.
<MicTheSpectator> I am a Kung Fu master! I have been taking off Jackets my entire life.
<Saturn> 08,01because you don't play the cello with your arms, you play it with your whole body
<LordDerpington> Everyone went around with their words on boards that they held up.
<Azuredragon> HARDER
<Bronysith> oh shit
<Yahooz> no face
<Wondershy> Saturn: Sounds intense!
<Silverscreen> 1,11No face.
<Bronysith> the original karate kid is on netflix
<sergio_scriptor> GilDash|Dinner : they wore silent in the matter there was no vioces but there was music
<pikorar> They were GilDash|Dinner, but it's okay because text would flash in front of the poeple's eyes to tell them what other people were saying.
<CrimsonPhoenix> SHIVERS
<Slyphoenix> you mean not to the face?
<Thorn> JACK OFF HARDER.

<PONY> mindfuck teaching
<SirGanjalf> dat was intense
<Nitram> now kiss
<Om> Deceptions.
<Silverscreen> 1,11One of the improvements from the original is that this film actually explains the philosophy behind the Karate Kid's seemingly meaningless work. The original shows WHAT it does, but never explains the hidden meaning of it.
<Magical_pab|Dinner> DAT AWESOME KARATE KID
<MicTheSpectator> I KNOEW IT.
<Meanwhile> And then everything was kung fu
<Yahooz> Dat realization
<Dken2021> so I can do kung fu by playing videogames all day?

<LordDerpington> Damn, I left my jacket at work on Friday...
<WallDives> srs.
<hen3ry> Pony fu is best fu
<Wood_stuck_to_a_pole> Silverscreen: I've always been wondering what wax on wax off meant.
<Sundaysmile> that girl I banged is kung fu
<GilDash|Dinner> Acleps: Not to you. :p
<Yahooz> Wait... so if everything is kung fu... everything is by default Chinese... lawl
<Azuredragon> Video games is Kung fu for the thumbs
<SirGanjalf> http://butterbeliever.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mind-blown-thumb.jpeg

<Kandarihu> Well, it was pretty well understood, even if not outright spelled out.
<LordDerpington> If you glomp 1000 times in chat, you learn kung fu
<Yahooz> yaaaatatattaaatta
<Wondershy> Yay Canterlot!
<Meanwhile> He has a car he doesn't drive.

<Om> GilDash|Dinner: Why u do that T-T
<Wood_stuck_to_a_pole> Man calligraphy is awesome.

<GilDash|Dinner> Om: Shouting loudly to a sleeping person that you have arrived into the chat is uneccessary. :|
<Silverscreen> 1,11@RyunosukeKnT: Correct, but in the film, it shows that the opponent's dojo puts more focus and emphasis on the offensive concept, hence why defence is so important. Not to mention that Defence is meant to be the purpose of Kung Fu and Karate anyway.
<CrimsonPhoenix> de l'eau
<Yahooz> Synchronize dance

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The style of Kung Fu that the female snake charmer is practicing is Crane Style Kung Fu. Practitioners of this style are very adept at balancing on one foot, as a crane does. It is interesting to note that she is controlling a cobra. This is another nod to the original The Karate Kid in which Daniel defeated a member of the Cobra Kai dojo by using the Crane technique.
