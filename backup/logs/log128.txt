<Suncatcher> yeah, it is long. 900-something pages last I counted.
<Zephirdd> Dave, bronies are still minority outside of youtube
<Jessim> I'd guess at least 75% male.
<Rainbow-Dash> You just set the mode to +i
<Baron_von_Brony> No ones body could possibly be ready for season 2
<Meanwhile> I'm good, if tired. Getting up at 6AM did not do much for my ability to stay up late GLaDOS.

<Shadowx> i listen to metal, play violent video games, kinda random for me to suddenly watch this
<Lunasta> Yeah, what gen is the MLP movie?
<Caboozles> But there was no contextual reason to.
<DSNesmith> and I mean to read that one about Applejack going to a fashion show with Rarity
<Saint_Absol> Hi

<Spazturtle> Latias4Ever are you using http://bronystate.net ?

<Sir_Hoofalot> Runs a bit slow on an emulator though
<[NLR]Lucid> Why not?
<LuckyLeaf> Zoom, enhance. That cracks me every time
<Lasharus> If he'd have ended it on Chapter 11, fine. But adding that last one was just evil.

<StarPlatinum> Google Chrome.
<DashWithRainbows> i went onto dinky page then back to brony state and stream works fine now
<mariomarc> ?
<Azure_Cadabra> What movie is this?
<Elky> newdcd: does the number of viewers really make a difference?
<gic1898> I'm sort of surprised "yay" isn't registered.
<RandomExtra> Yes.
<Distort> yeah, but it was supposed to be ambiguous, and the director felt that it suggested him being a replicant too heavily
<Rainbow_derp> see the blade runner curse
<fluttercry> This future is cooler than what turned out to be true
<Buytoast> Polaroids are classics.
<Emily> 100 more bronies to go
<kirzstryfe> ooo, I like stuffy stuff
<MuNova> HEY GUYS
<DeadlyPon3> yay
<nah> @elky yes.

<VendorPony> WHAT IS THIS INDIAN MUSIC?!?!!?!?
<Jessim> Lol
<a041744> this has really good music
<Lasharus> Though in fairness, given that Dave and me are the ONLY ones discussing it, perhaps we should take it to a PM conversation Dave?
<MightyMatrix> yup 50mins of the 117mins movie
<SuperBrony64> Zed: Actually, welcome to 2019
<Jessim> Bird on head
<DashWithRainbows> friends know im a brony

<Elky> because I imagine it's just uploaded onto a random server
<Blinky> Seems better to leave it vague

<Lonewanderer118> Thanks for the falcon :D
<Tovler> Harrison Ford looks younger than he did in Star Wars

<DeadlyPon3> He make the snake out of BRONIES
<Silverscreen> 11If we're talking about fanfics, perhaps I should mention my TwilightxTrixie shipping fanfic. :P
<a041744> Why did it have to be snakes?
<Marelin> that isnt harisson ford is it?
<Twilot_Spokle> Hello all, how far into the movie is this?
<chedduhr> SNAKE!
<Emily> Good grief.
<Ninja> My entire year doesn't keep up with all things internet
<pony_yay> HE HATES ARTIFICIAL SNAKES
<PrincessCelestia> whats with the indian music?
<Lasharus> And now Dave vanishes on me :(
<DaveKenroy> Naa, I think we discussed most of what we needed to discuss, though if you have any other fics to d'aww, squee, or yell about, as rainbow said: "Sure, Why not?"
<mib_h2w65d> When are they going to stream season 1?
<DashWithRainbows> golfing gets boring after a while
<Suncatcher> ...?
<PonehMan> Snake? SNAAAAAAAKE
<mib_g7c8qu> pony!!
<mariomarc> SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE
<Buytoast> Is that John Madden?
<DSNesmith> OH HAI BIG MAC
<Solarboy> Waaaaaaaait, this is a B movie?

<chedduhr> SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE
<Caboozles> Pony
<Seviper> PONY
<Shadowfax> Ponys?
<Ninja> so I'm pretty sure I'm the only brony in my high school
<Distort> according to Harrison ford, he intended for him to be human. but again, it was supposed to be ambiguous
<Caboozles> I spotted a pony
<ElBoufon> John Madden John Madden John Madden John Madden
<SuperBrony64> As we can see, Asia has taken over the world around this time.
<RainbroDash> Were those ostriches? O.o
<FlaschenJoe11> yes it is
<Meanwhile> Harrison Ford will always have to deal with snakes.
<Zero_Starlight> Snake? What's going on? Snake! SNAKE! SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!
<DashWithRainbows> same....
<Lunasta> Saaaake?
<Metostopholes> LIQUIIIIIID
<VendorPony> I KNOW RIGHT
<Darken_Skye> this must have been hell to shoot
<SilkAMV> I think the fact that she can talk to OWL should not be ambiguous. It should be left up to the reader to decide if she's crazy or not. Spike certainly wouldn't accept that she could.
<Dermathil> This is LITTLE INDIA, kinda
*EmmettBrown is confused by slar
<pony_yay> INCOMING JAI HO
<Lasharus> Ghehe, that's fair.
<Zero_Starlight> X3

<C9316> Baby don't hurt me
<Spazturtle> mib_h2w65d After we stream G1
<VioletVanilla> 6Because Asians are taking over everything silly~
<DashWithRainbows> they know what a brony is, but more on the rule 34 side

<C9316> don't hurt me

<Shutterfly> god now i wish they were streaming indiana jones
<djdexcat> Confound these ponies. I never read fanfics before FiM.

<C9316> No more
<SilkAMV> Should be ambiguous&
<Meanwhile> Shoo be doo
<Puppy> thank you rawrity ^u^ I was told my beggining was too boring so I'm spicing it up

<Flutterfan> LOL, Nah, I spelled Fluttershy wrong, I know
<PonehMan> SEA PONIES SHIT!
<joetraincool> zE GOGGLES, ZE DO NOTING
<Blinky> So the director disagrees with him?
<Solarboy> Oh, thanks guys :3 I was wondering why it was so well done.
<SilkAMV> *
<mib_7qtlny> I can't see the stream
<Grundle> Because they're better at math
<Flutterfan> I tend to to dhat
<Dundrio> The stream isn't working for me :'(
<General_Hazard> im in college i have no idea if there are other bronies
<Quiltone> I'm coming in late but didn't Ridley Scott say that Decker was a reploid in the end?
<Ninja> mine don't even know what a brony is
<Flutterfan> do that*
<fluttercry> I've seen this about 6 times but I never quite got why everyone was asian
<Happy-Kah> is it a marathon thing

<StressTester> Low quality stream to view!
<nah> @flutterfan why are you telling me this
<Happy-Kah> there are lots of tings
<Lasharus> Ah. :p
<Elky> derpderpderpderp: I wish, but I'm afraid the b movie doesn't have sea ponies
<Blinky> Weird that they have such a different view on the character
<MuNova> I think it stopped o_O
<Distort> ridley's flip-floped on the issue
<Octavia> 13This week is different than most.
<Metostopholes> IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE COLONEL:

<Octavia> 13We are indeed doing a marethon.
<Lasharus> Aargh!
<Ninja> but hes a freshman
<Firefly> Is there a viewer limit
<Tehpogo> It's not Cyberpunk without a Chinatown.
<Denied_Existence> WOAH THERE
<Rainbow_derp> Dundrio select low quality
<trebthegamer> again. chinatown???
<Darf14> Wow, china town sure has aged well over the years

<General_Hazard> i try not to be friends wit anyone cuz they're all kinda unpleasant :?
<Natleyn> MuNova: not sure how what I said applies, since it's a link, but it IS a picture. My bad, too
<Dermathil> FRENCH CANADIAN BRONIES REPRESENT!!! This is a census to see if there is interest to make a meet-up group in that part of the world
<PonehMan> yeah
<djdexcat> O_O
<Distort> what the hell?
<Nittany_Tiger> 21st century pipe smoking.
<General_Hazard> :/
<DaveKenroy> Though I do like Twixie ships
<ColorSpectrum> 7So who's psyched? 8D
<Meanwhile> Let me move my mouth without talking.
<DashWithRainbows> >get a shirt that obviously signifies you as a brony
<DeadlyPon3> DAMN YOU FRESHMAN!
<CCCPKiller> hello
<Stonegaze> Hey, sorry to interrupt but I missed a lot of the story so if anypony could help me the clear a few things up. If one of you could tell me what has happened before this moment, that would be greatly appreciated.
<chedduhr> it would be awesome if there was an ostrich or an emu in season 2!
<Troggle> ha
<Magneto> No techno-music or Rammstein in a club? This is a fake future!
<Lasharus> Those people are enough to drive you mental.
<lastone1376> sceen of red
<Happy-Kah> marethon, nice
<RainbroDash> OPIUM DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!
<Foxpony> how many ponies you think will be on for the premiere of season 2?
<Silverscreen> 11: /
<DashWithRainbows> >walk around town for a few hours
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Elky: Maybe it's for the best, we would've needed sea ponies to save us from the flooded chat.
<Puppy> like since we can't understand the owl, we can't tell if she is really talking to it or not.
<DeadlyPon3> LP
<shadow_light> The Great abd Powerful Trixie
<Shutterfly> bluh gtg
<Buytoast> Opium den?
<Shadowx> lol'd
<Zephirdd> I hate ships in general
<shadow_light> oops
<DashWithRainbows> >i found 4 other bronies in 2 hours
<Zero_Starlight> Mr. Duck, I'd like to ask you some questions.
<chedduhr> it's not cyberpunk without a tron homage!
<Gnomesmasher> :/ the sound is a lil off
<Zephirdd> except Flutter/Mac
<Lemon> Me! I hope Discord will put up a fight...
<billy> in my school instead of the word "freshmen" we use the word "faggot"
<PrincessCelestia> over 500
<sklar> ValtheJean sure ill with you guys how do?
<Navy_Brony> Ever watch ponies? All the time...pal.
<Zephirdd> that is too cute
<Tovler> Quebec City is the best city in North America
<ColorSpectrum> 0Bye Shutterfly...
<SirReginald> 500 viewers. Best stream since forever.
<mariomarc> i want to see more zecora, more zebras even
<Lasharus> But yeah Silverscreen, I can hardly read stories in potentia. :P
<mib_s139j3> WHEN DOES IT START?
<General_Hazard> @Stonegaze REPLICANTS ARE ON THE LOOSE
<trebthegamer> i was thinking of that joke during the zoom in scene
<FlaschenJoe11> at least 550
<DeadlyPon3> Faggot for fab <3
<MrPoniator_> Mane6 stream had +1k
<Ninja> I actually haven't watched the movie
<Tehpogo> Actually, this came out either just before or round about the same time as Tron
<Slowter> Later
<gic1898> Perhaps a subtle shirt, so noone stops you for ponies.
<Drakengarde> I was going to make a smartass comment about ships
<PonehMan> discord is best pony
<PrincessCelestia> and I hope discord has his own theme song like hexxus have.
<ColorSpectrum> 0I wonder...
<MrPoniator_> Let's see if we can break that
<MuNova> Natleyn: No worries, the text color is still disruptive-like. I'll be a good girl. lol
<Dermathil> indeed it is, Tovler.
<Grundle> Everytown is chinatown
<Distort> anyway, i was saying that ripley has flip-flopped on deckard being human or replicant
<nah> god
<MuNova> well, a good pony
<Quiltone> I don't care what kind of fic it is so long as it's well written
<Lasharus> (with respect, of course)
<fluttercry> it's over 500!!!
<Natleyn> Bye Shutterfly!
<chedduhr> ZEBRA PEGASUS
<Octavia> 13Each week we do two movies, and typically two pony eps. But this week we're doing the two movies and took the pony eps out because we're doing a S1 marethon all night leading up to the S2 premiere at 9am est. :0
<Ninja> all I know is that this is cool looking
<gingerbrony666> Has anyone in a film ever said: "I don't know him?" and has actually been telling the truth?
<Foxpony> I love Discord ^^ Q in ponyville ^^
<VendorPony> INDIAN MUSIC? IT'S A TRAP
<Luna> 07I wonder how many more we will have when S2 airs
<Elky> heh
*Natleyn hugs Shutterlfy goodnight
<nah> the lottery's gonna be hard as hell to win now
<Zero_Starlight> That's an... intereting glass...
<DeadlyPon3> Say it's a social experiment
<MightyMatrix> So your school is 4chan then
<Darf14> It must be a new record since we hit over 500
<ElBoufon> You're right Tovler
*EmmettBrown unplugs his new trout slapping machine
<prince-dari> Hm
<Shadowx> im going to have to link this soon to facebook, and then not care about the haters that i shouldnt have on my friends list
<Silverscreen> 11My TwilightxTrixie fanfic is a Valentines Day fanfic where Trixie plays Secret Admirer.
<Drakengarde> But for the life of me I can't bring to mind the names of any actual ships
<Diftraku> getting sick leave for this whole week helped me keep my pony fix in control
<Rainbow_derp> Lemon . no discord......
<Flameshy> what was it?
<Ziltoid> >Montréal
<PonehMan> over 9000
<Sir_Hoofalot> same year
<Lasharus> Oh, and DaveKenroy - I only read a few fanfics thus far.
<Luna> 07hahaha
<Shadowx> :D
<SuperBrony64> Luna: Probably 1000.
<powderedlightning> over 90000
<prince-dari> You could either try another browser or restarting chrome.
<chedduhr> lol intresting
<Yixion> http://bronystate.net/theatre isnt working
<billy> lol
<RAWRity> the idea for my fic is that as time goes on, all the fanfic, fanart, music, stories, and creepypastas that fans of the show have created start to impact the actual universe of FiM and all the dark and nasty additions and interpretations of the show and characters begin to destroy Ponyville and Equestria
<Natleyn> Luna, so many... x.x
<DaveKenroy> I especially liked Kindnesses Reward

<DeadlyPon3> AUSSIE!
<Foolonthehillz> Hey Wrek, do you still proofread for Lafter?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Yixion: Try switching to the low quality stream
<DashWithRainbows> it would be very racist and their motto would be "OP is a faggot"
<RandomExtra> ...I shudder to think... PINKIEQUEST BEFORE S2 Episode EVERYBODY!
<Fluttershy`> oh gawds not over 9000
<kirzstryfe> 5309
<Lasharus> Inevitably.
<Magneto> Come over here, i want to jump your bones.

<DaveKenroy> Ahh, Yeah, I guess I've read more than my share of fics
<chedduhr> season 2 also needs moar luna
<VinylScratch> Holy crap, I haven't seen a channel move this fast since #nipponsei on Rizon.
<VinylScratch> Rofl.
<DeadlyPon3> *Brohoofs*
<SilkAMV> There's also potential for Fluttershy to not be able to accept that Twi seems to communicate better with an animal than she can.
<Wrek> 05Foolonthehillz yep
<Elky> Yixion: Go to bronystate.co.cc
<Drakengarde> No, I mean, like the Spanish galleon or something. xD

<Rainbow_derp> hey what time do stumblers not like?
<lastone1376> typo
<Ratlan> 21, now we're getting somewheere
<SuperBrony64> C9317: Correct.
<Drakengarde> I fail. Hahahaha!
<desertman2> yes
<Happy-Kah> sleep is for felbe humans
<mib_h2w65d> About what time will they stream season 1?
<DSNesmith> so is this movie going anywhere? -.o
<chedduhr> blasted deathsticks....
<Lasharus> I quite liked The Light in the Darkness.
<mib_4gi1zq> HI EVERYPONY
<Uh_Maze_Ing> is that the actor thats also indiana jones?
<Metostopholes> Man, I'm glad phonebooths will make a comeback in the future
<PrincessCelestia> I hope we see discord true form.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :P
<trebthegamer> in the future drinking glasses will be silly
<C9317> Kay thanks!
<gic1898> And it would still manage to be a decent school.
<[NLR]Lucid> Well, I think I'm going to go take a nap before the marethon

<desertman2> after MLP movie
<MuNova> Spazturtle: just some flash images with traffic lights next to them that don't do anything
<Octavia> 13The S1 marethon starts after the two movies. :)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no links please
<DSNesmith> TAKE ZE PLEASURZ FROM DE SERPENT
<Lasharus> Apparently referencing Cupcakes, but I managed to avoid reading that one so far.
<Dermathil> aaah, so more french canadian bronies are present. good.
<Foolonthehillz> Ah
<Sir_Hoofalot> I heared there's going to be a Neuromancer movie
<LGNR> How do these futuristic movies always get the future so wrong?
<Ninja> Harrison Ford is in a lot of great movies
<Aponymoose> man this stream is going to take up SO MUCH of my bandwidth, regardless of whether i switch to low quality
<DashWithRainbows> when season 2 airs what are you guys gonna celebrate it with?
<coopm0re> how long is left of this movie?
<fluttercry> what is the mode?
<Tehpogo> You don't want to bring up Attack Of The Clones.
<RainbowDashFanatic> 3RAINBOW DASH IS BEST PON3!
<mib_4gi1zq> Howq long are the movies?
<PonehMan> what's the special stream going on for EQD?
<Ninja> like Star Wars
*Shadowx yay
<Sir_Hoofalot> A Snowcrash movie would be cool as well
<Tehpogo> You want to go home and rethink your life.
<Hat> k
<Lasharus> And I intend to keep it that way.
<fluttercry> first time in IRC
<Buytoast> There is no Discord.
<General_Hazard> @Stonegaze Replicants are robots that are superior to humans. Blade Runners (basically police offers/detectives) have been ordered to kill all Replicants. A small group of them are in hiding
<billy> we have 4 words that evryone must remember "1, op, 2, is, 3, a, 4, faggot"
<DashWithRainbows> im going to do a whole week with sleep again
<Buytoast> Only Zuul.
<Parker> Hmmm
<mallam> scroll down for countdown http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/mlp-facebook-page-countdown-7.html
<nah> @rainbowdashfanatic damn right
<Foolonthehillz> I just started with the most recent chapter :P
<Lemon> Yeah, I thought Discord was going to be a pony! But I like the idea of a Chimera!
<mariomarc> a waht movie?
<VioletVanilla> 6Please leave the links out and enjoy the movie everypony.
<Parker> Greetings
<Celestiawesome> Celestia is best pony, you fool.
<chedduhr> lol dat accent
<Drakengarde> I've avoided reading that too, but I seen so much about it from other material
<DeadlyPon3> Is Harrison Ford a good actor, or just in a lot of good movies?
<DashWithRainbows> god that week was amazing
<Luna> 07no worries fluttercry
<ValtheJean> 2,14 again, no links please
<Quiltone> Good Lasharus. I mean it's well written but it is...unsettling.
<Saint_Absol> The thing I've never understood about sci-fi: Why do all glasses and cups look so weird in the future?
<DSNesmith> twi is such a troll
<Foxpony> I want to mareathon all night, but I cannot. only enough time to watch the premiere and go to work.
<kirzstryfe> same here I think
<Jessim> I'm definitely steering away from cupcakes and all stories alike.
<fluttercry> There is no emotion. Only peace
<Natleyn> No links!
<C9317> Trollestia?
<Meanwhile> Celestia is a douche.
<[NLR]Lucid> Until I return bronies, love and tolerance
<Luna> 07we are finetuning things in the background
<DSNesmith> rarity shows her her special talent
<Drakengarde> I pretty much know more-or-less exactly what happens anyway
<Shadowfax> Spike is best pony
<SuperBrony64> Movie First, Links later.
<jubian> @Lemon Dammit!
<Stonegaze> General Okay.
<BronyGuy> Its not too bad...
<Slowter> Isn't Celestia a Mare?
<Dermathil> No spoilers in chat!
<Metostopholes> Oh damn, Snow Crash would be awesome
<gingerbrony666> Why can't it actually be Discord's true form? Why does everyone think he's got another form
<Aponymoose> 9Discord has the BEST VOICE
<DSNesmith> twilight instantly does it ten times better without practicing
<Zephirdd> Cupcakes is amusing
<RainbowDashFanatic> 3Is movie not on for anyone else?
<Spazturtle> Everybody having problims with the sream go to the new webiste: http://www.bronystate.net/theatre/dash/
<djdexcat> The best way to read Cupcakes is to just piece together what happens based off of random comments.
<coopm0re> how long left in blade runner?
<mib_mj63tq> so is this where the new season will be streamed in a few hours?
<Slowter> not a pony?
<SirReginald> dat voice
<Lasharus> Gore makes me nauseous. I can only imagine what in-depth described gore would do to me.
<General_Hazard> B)
<shadow_light> Trixie
<DaveKenroy> Lasharus, Yeah, that one was a good one. I like the pinkie-dash fics, even if they're not shipping
<Celestiawesome> Think what you will, Celestia is my favorite.
<MuNova> I LOVE CELESTIA
<mib_4gi1zq> My girlfriend and I are gonna watch all the ponies for like the 3rd time
<Blinky> I read cupcakes out of curiousity
<Natleyn> Seeya [NLR]Lucid
<Grundle> So this movie takes place in 2019
<EmmettBrown> Ok guys,what if the creators are just trolling us and season 2 is like G3.5
<Parker> The movie is not on
<chedduhr> no i don
<shadow_light> is
<Lasharus> Though it may require me to buy a new keyboard.
<Puppy> only true genius's can understand the greatness that is rarity.
<shadow_light> best
<MuNova> she's ossum
<C9317> she probably threatens to send you to the moon if you don't like her
*Natleyn hugs [NLR]Lucid goodnight
<Zephirdd> The author achieves what he wants perfectly
<DSNesmith> applejack works herself nearly to death harvesting
<Blinky> It's just gore for gore's sake
<mariomarc> nice voice harrison
<RainbowDashFanatic> K sorry.
<Celestiawesome> BROHOOF
<Zephirdd> and it is REALLY well written
<Luna> 07that is correct
<Parker> THE MOVIE, ISNT WORKING
<Rainbow_derp> I don't know if its the antisipation or the decongestent but I am literly bouncing in my seat
<desertman2> Dammit Lemon, don't spoil us!
<Ninja> I would say good actor
<everfreenights> KILL HIM WITH THE SNAKE
<DSNesmith> twilight pulls half the orchard down herself at once
<Quiltone> I read it and all the sequels/spinoffs in one sitting
<nah> @rainbowdashfanatic low quality stream.
<Ziltoid> dat voice
<Tehpogo> High Pitched Ford just sounds weird.
<DeadlyPon3> MORAL ABUSES: Like my Voice <3!
<Lasharus> Well, that one's tagged as FriendShipping Dave.
<Ninja> He did a great job as indy
<KaiInara1> hey all
<Lonewanderer118> Wow hat voice
<Darf14> She sure has a big snake *wink*
<Lonewanderer118> that*
<[NLR]Lucid> Oh, I shall be back at some point before season 2
<Zed> Harrison Ford, acting like a dweeb.
<Grundle> The next ten years are going to be interesting, going from now to self-lacing shoes and hoverboards to this
<Gnomesmasher> boobies :D
<mariomarc> he does it good
<BronyumHexofloride> i tell ya Vangilis really brings this film to life
<Octavia> 13Drinkin in style? lol
<Dermathil> SPOILERS ARE INSTA-PERMABAN
<Mastertortilla27> Wow that's a fast moving wall of text....
<sklar> ValtheJean cool but nobodys there also i got out bitch time to pay!
<Drakengarde> All I know is that Rainbow Dash was graphically and horribly murdered in the most gruesome and violently gory fashion possible
<RainbowDashFanatic> Thanks
<MuNova> Gnomesmasher: Eeyup
<Tehpogo> It's like he inhaled helium between takes
<[NLR]Lucid> Also, Dat glitter. And the snake
<FlaschenJoe11> i'm gonna sleep now. night everypony
<Troggle> That's basically the premise
<Lemon> Oh crap... sorry. *ashamed of self*
<TwilightSpark1e> 6First time in bronystate, so whats up guys?
<WhatPayne> He can pull off that dweeb voice
<Wrek> 05nn
<Rainbow_derp> Um I never saw 3.5
<PonehMan> no boobies
<Lasharus> Pretty much, yes.
<Luna> 07night FlaschenJoe11
<Natleyn> Night FlaschenJoe11 !
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sklar: what?
<DaveKenroy> I told myself I wouldn't read Cupcakes, but that went about as well as water in a bucket full of holes
<Sorakey> yo
<DSNesmith> the only person who twilight can't troll
<Drakengarde> and instead of actually reading it, I just...let my own imagine take over.
<Sorakey> lol
<LGNR> Such convenient camera angles
<pony_yay> DAT VOICE
<RandomExtra> +i means that you can't use /join to enter the room, and that you'd have to use the regular method of entering to do so.
<desertman2> no colors
<mariomarc> maybe he did
<Ratlan> Twilight is just overpowered.
<DSNesmith> is Spike
*FlaschenJoe11 wishes all a good night
<Rohan> Ohmanwhat'sgoingonIdon'teven
<House> I love this voice
<Distort> 15i dunno, there's just something that leaves a bad taste in my mouth about Cupcakes. it just strikes me as... wrong
<C9317> lol boobies
<Wrek> 05hi TwilightSpark1e
<Buytoast> He' interested in what she does with that snake.
<Gnomesmasher> same
<Elky> hi twilight
<Lasharus> And I'm happy to keep my knowledge of Cupcakes so distant.
<DSNesmith> because he's too busy trolling her
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Harrison with the nasly voice
<Quiltone> That's not the terrifying part. It's how the killer acts during it all
<Rated-RPonyStar> "You think you know me..."
<Parker> Also first time in bronystate
*[NLR]Lucid hugs everybronie
<powderedlightning> nice cover bro
<Elky> inb4 no colors
<Natleyn> Twilight, no colors :<
<TwilightSpark1e> 0oh my bad
<Zephirdd> Draken, what is surprising about it isnt the gore and the topic of the fic
<Rated-RPonyStar> I'm back
<MuNova> PonehMan: WRYYYYY
<Buytoast> I can hear it in his voice.
<SilkAMV> Yeah, Twilight can't show up Rarity.
<shadow_light> purple lol
<PrincessCelestia> dirty holes?
<mib_vhad4c> has anyone done a bladerunner pony xover fanfic?
<Octavia> 13Night whoever is leaving. :P
<everfreenights> NERD
<Ratlan> Welcome Twilight
<DeadlyPon3> Little Dirty Voice
<Slowter> Caution!!! Abort! Abort!!
<Tovler> Is it possible to spoil Star Wars: the Clone Wars?
<DeadlyPon3> I mean HOLES
<Darf14> No colors noob
<House> >Dirty holes
<DeadlyPon3> Sorry
<Drakengarde> I'm pretty sure whatever I can come up with hasn't already been written in said fic
<Elky> heh
<everfreenights> is this the minor nudity part?
<SlurryMoon> Dirty Hoels
<desertman2> i did it first
<mib_vhad4c> twilight is clearly a replicant
<BronyumHex> dat voice lol
<techdude300> Why is she sparkly?
<mib_4gi1zq> YAY PONIES
<shadow_light> naked
<Magneto> Drilling holes? In 2017? Don't they have mini-cameras? Geez!
<Drakengarde> Or some spinoff
<TwilightSpark1e> 0I got it the first time
<Zephirdd> what is amusing, imo, is how the autho maintains Pinkie's character through the whole story
<C9317> star wars the clone wars...
<Diftraku> Holes, everywhere!
<Wrek> 05play nice Darf14
<SparkCandle> yaaaaay
<Flameshy> lol
<General_Hazard> I would say PRETTY good actor, but there are better folks. The scripts in his movies kinda make the character for him
<Suncatcher> tier separation. Twi's a wizard, rarity's a rogue-type with a few magic tricks, and Applejack something mundane like a fighter.
<MuNova> Um
<sklar> ValtheJean nobody there thats what
<C9317> people actually watch that!?
<MuNova> fffffffuuuuuuuu
<Meanwhile> Fishbowl hairdryer
<DeadlyPon3> THE FUTURE OF PERSON GROOMING
<trebthegamer> i think i spotted a nipple! kill the feed! lol
<C9317> lol
<Fluttershy`> Octavia you're light a puple beam of happiness in this randomness...
<Jessim> DO WANT THAT DRYER
<Darf14> sorry wrek
<DSNesmith> this movie is promising nudity
<Zephirdd> and how RD was a perfect character for the story
<DaveKenroy> Though the fact it didn't bother me as much as it should have concerns me somewhat...
<Lasharus> No comment. :P
<HeartString> 4hey everypony how is you?
<Foxpony> she's a Shiny! use the Masterball!
<joetraincool> personal wind tunnel
<DSNesmith> and not delivering
<Phi> Evening, bronies
<Buytoast> Dryer Dome.
<PonehMan> She's been haning out with twilight sparkle
<mariomarc> neat blowdryer
<SirReginald> hair dryer of the future
<chedduhr> so this is the brief nudity?
<Buytoast> We need those.
<lastone1376> now that's a hair dryer
<Lumidaub> ... i hate snakes.
<Lemon> Dat' expression
<RAWRity> the only problem I'm running into in mine is that it's hard not to feel my soul being stapped when I have Fluttershy or Rarity trying to do something that's outright malicious.
<Shadowx> lol monster rehab
<mib_h2w65d> 0About what time are they going to stream Season 1?
<nah> @c9317 it's okay.
<Troggle> Yeah, I was suprsied how well they kept in cahracter
<General_Hazard> Robo-Snake
<Shadowx> yumm
<DeadlyPon3> He Hates snakes
<Dermathil> TITS
<Tovler> I love how impractical the old future is.
<Octavia> 13:P

<DSNesmith> replicant snake
<NoOne> boob
<fluttercry> dem boobs
<BronyQuest> BEWBS
<RandomExtra> Nah, we've had worse than this.
<MuNova> The stream froze up for me a while ago so I'm missing da boobies :(
<Vergil> Snakes.....
<WhatPayne> RobotPinkie, still alive?
<Metostopholes> *cough* sorry
<Sir_Hoofalot> boobies!
<Lasharus> I think a large part of it is shock value DaveKenroy.
<C9317> dem heels
<PinkamenaDianePie> Ohey Nudity.
<Gnomesmasher> lolnipple
<BronyQuest> My virgin eyes.
<MuNova> refreshing
<Latias4Ever> Yeah... Well, while I wait, time to play some Metal Slug!
<shadow_light> side boob
<Ziltoid> breasts
<Suncatcher> a high enough level wiz can do everything anyone else can, typically better
<Vergil> Why'd it have to be SNAKES!?
<DSNesmith> why'd it have to be replicants?
<powderedlightning> ... unreal snake...
<coopm0re> ooh. breasts!
<mariomarc> yes
<everfreenights> PLOT
<Caboozles> Okay
<Caboozles> Um
<mib_vhad4c> there it was folks
<SparkCandle> A future where fake snakes are cheaper than real ones
<Azure_Cadabra> Alright, i'll see you guys in the morning! Later ponies.
<Caboozles> Wut
<Destroyer> ye were warned about brief nudity :P
<Foxpony> O.O did I just see hooters!
<Graffy_Hooves> bewbies

*Saint_Absol shrugs. "I just have weird thoughts."
<Moondancer> tits
<mariomarc> BEWB
<Zephirdd> holy shit, I'm old
<mib_4gi1zq> Is the movie on?
<gingerbrony666> so if I've got dis straight: Are we going straight to the next film once Blade Runner's over? Or are we having a break
<Slowter> Wait, so no one can afford Snakes?
<C9317> I got a thing for high heels
<Yixion1> lol
<Appleblooom> Are them like udders?
<DSNesmith> movie just got 20% hornier
<coopm0re> i do indeed detect breast
<Lasharus> You knew what was coming, so you weren't as shocked as you might've been if you'd read it without foreknowledge.
<mib_vhad4c> huzzah!
<Octavia> 13Dat slight nudity
<Meanwhile> pawnch
<BakedMacintosh> told
<Ninja> Someone else was supposed to be Indiana Jones but then the director saw star wars
<fluttercry> dat ass
<Foxpony> Bewbiez!
<GoldenArbiter> it wouldnt be an 80s movie, without boobies.
<sklar> Darf14 launch cruise missiles just for shits and giggles :)
<Foolonthehillz> Bookfort, this is REd Lobster. Over.
<SparkCandle> CYBORG
<PinkamenaDianePie> SUDDENLY
<Zephirdd> I used to eat 8 of those mini pizzas and still be hungry
<Buytoast> Let him exploit you.
<Tovler> Books about math, come and get them at TIITS
<Grundle> groady
<LGNR> So pro
<PonehMan> damn ninja!
<SparkCandle> KILL
<SparkCandle> KILL
<SparkCandle> KILL
<Drakengarde> Yeah, I've heard of that. What's odd is that I can actually imagine Pinkie doing just that
<Rohan> Lol, I cannot load the video fast 'nuff
<Quiltone> I love how RD is almost always the one to get killed/mutilated/broken winged
<mariomarc> that didnt hit
<Foolonthehillz> Bookfort, do you copy?
<Zephirdd> I barely ate 4
<SparkCandle> CYBORG KILL
<Ratlan> Cya Azure
<Destroyer> sneak attack critical!
<Lemon> lulwut.
<VendorPony> FIGT
<shadow_light> wow what a hore
<HeartString> 0i know i just saw it sorry
<Shelltoon> lol, transparent jackets
<Magneto> Real animals are all dead in Blade Runner.
<DeadlyPon3> Nice trenchcoat
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Not realistic. Han Solo would never let a bitch slap him
<Rainbow_derp> guess she should cover up
<SparkCandle> er... actually a robot
<mib_vhad4c> she's a fembot!!
<Foolonthehillz> Copy Red Lobster, this is Bookfort
<Gnomesmasher> lol
<PinkamenaDianePie> FINISH HIM
<trebthegamer> wow they made clip on bra's
<WhatPayne> Sure that jacket covers you well.
<House> PLASTIC BAG COAT
<TwilightSpark1e> 0...well then, theres a bit too many people in here, i'm out, see you guys later i suppose
<powderedlightning> ya clear plastic covers u well
<Drakengarde> Though probably not to Rainbow Dash
<Suncatcher> but not with as much style
<Ratlan> Must people focus so incessantly on that one sscene?
<NoOne> depends on what you mean by snakes
<PonehMan> she wears that body condom like a champ
<Natleyn> FINISH HER.
<Uh_Maze_Ing> lol
<Khippy> Wait, when does the B-Movie start?
<Meanwhile> Run in the clear plastic coat.
<DaveKenroy> It didn't really shock me too much, I've read my share of dark/grimdark fics/stories (non-pony)
<Drakengarde> More like...just, in general
<Zephirdd> If you ever watched Happy Three Friends
<Natleyn> ^
<DSNesmith> I'd say more style
<BakedMacintosh> this is quite amusing
<DeadlyPon3> PLASTIC BAG COAT LADY, AWAAAAAY!
<gic1898> The pinnacle of style.
<Zephirdd> its easy to imagine cupcakes
<BronyumHex> FATALITY
<Rohan> wat
<Foxpony> those clothes are made from the finest silk!
<Diftraku> It doubles as a grocery bag!
<Slowter> why'd she push over that hobo?
<shadow_light> she can run omg
<Ziltoid> dat budweiser ad
<mib_g7c8qu> running through window time
<SirReginald> Recovered from that neck injury pretty quick
<Dundrio> It doesn't work :'(
<DashWithRainbows> just noticed bronystate has just broken the 500 barrier
<Rated-RPonyStar> Insert cool chase scene
<Darf14> Oh crud! A CRUISE MISS- *BOOM*
<chedduhr> oops...
<StressTester> its the futre what do you expect
<desertman2> twilightsparkle: you can go to other rooms
<everfreenights> EVERYONE GETTIN KNOCKED OVER
<Silverscreen> 11Cupcakes was a gorefest that was as good as any Saw movie after number 3, which is to say not really good. It'd be better if it focused on the psychological aspect.
<Drakengarde> If she were to ever completely go off the deep end.
<MrPoniator_> That's the best outfit ever
<Lasharus> A bit.
<coopm0re> run! run! run like a son of a gun!
<DaveKenroy> I hated Happy Tree Friends
<StressTester> err i mean the 80's
<Lasharus> Gore for gore's sake really isn't that amusing to me.
<Shadowx> wha is the next movie btw? i had enough fun getting to where i am
<House> Little did they know, but the costume design dept predicted Lady Gaga
<Celestiawesome> There's that gun that was the inspiration for the gun in Fallout New Vegas
<Stonegaze> You're gonna get a lot of static electro shocks wearing htat sorta suit.
<VicViper> what
<mib_a815nk> Um, nothings playing lol
<Navy_Brony> Think I'll be skippin the scheduled B-movie tonight ;)
<VicViper> he just got his ass kicked by a girl?
<Lemon> Rarity's dress or GTFO
<DeadlyPon3> ITS OVER 9- Oh wait, no it doesn't
<General_Hazard> mother of god
<MightyMatrix> yup
<Rookeealding> did you just see a woman in a clear plastic raincoat run by hear?
<Cobalt> Evening bronies. I'm getting a time out on the stream window, should I just keep hitting Try again?
<Octavia> 13Kihppy, its already playing
<Metostopholes> Love those light up umbrellas
<Foxpony> which gun?
<Silverscreen> 11^
<Ratlan> True
<DeadlyPon3> Lady Gaga would NOT wear that
<WhatPayne> Called "that gun"
<Saint_Absol> Some time after this one I think
<PonehMan> get outta the way sirry chinese people
<Sir_Hoofalot> deckard needs some augs
<Quiltone> See it DID do that for me, Silverscreen.
<desertman2> anon: go to bronystate
<SilkAMV> Yeah, the day Twilight threads a needle perfectly through a whole is the Day Pinkie settles an argument with logical debate.
<djdexcat> Agreed, Silverscreen
<House> OH LOOK ATARI
<billy> links to my pony folders http://www.mediafire.com/?v3eqnyw5bnce36h http://www.mediafire.com/?f1fbk9oyt2zu3k3
<Drakengarde> The movie derped!
<kirzstryfe> have to agree with you there Lasharus
<Octavia> 13Oh wait.
<Gnomesmasher> this needs to be a podcast too
<Tehpogo> Shit. Thought that was the Benny Hill theme kicking off
<Meanwhile> Harrison Ford gets his ass kicked by girls all the time.
<DashWithRainbows> most likely would
<Celestiawesome> Literally called "That Gun"
<mib_vhad4c> she's toast
<SilkAMV> hole*
<Khippy> :P
<LGNR> Gee, those cars sure are going somewhere.
<NoOne> haray haray haray
<StressTester> *MuSt go to Low Quality Stream *
<DeadlyPon3> Hari Kristna
<Hat> Cobalt: try low quality
<Foxpony> where's that found at?
<fluttercry> Dat gun
<Luna> 07Heya Cobalt on which site are you atm?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Cobalt: Try switching to the low quality stream, it worked for me at least
<trebthegamer> hare hare
<Magneto> Quick: Drive over them for extra points!
<Octavia> 13I was thinking Blade Runner was the b movie. lol
<Zephirdd> Well Silverscreen, that would be true if the author was trying to make someone feel sad for RD
<Darf14> *cough*...ugh did someone get the license plate no on the missle? *faints*
<mib_94rb5e> I DONT GET IT
<Quiltone> Because Pinkie stayed so chipper and didn't seem to realize she was doing something terrible
<Meanwhile> When he isn't flying his helicopter around mountains looking for stranded climbers.
<Slowter> Anyway to move the Chat box?
<Drakengarde> Oh no, wait. Just needed to reconnect
<Khippy> Silly
<Zephirdd> but the point of the fic is to horrify the reader
<Octavia> 13I'm doing SO many things at once, its hectic.
<sklar> sklar/join#lobby
<House> Not outlandish enough?
<C9317> SHEPARD
<gingerbrony666> how do you go to over rooms?
<Shadowx> well lets all congregate in AJ again so we can make sure octavia isnt lonely :)
<Wrek> 05Cobalt please pm a mod for assistance, the chat is so damned spammy >.>
<LGNR> It's like the cars are going ... nowhere at all.
<C9317> WREX
<Zephirdd> and the author achieves it with maestry
<Ratlan> Plus, while twi can make an awesome evening gown for the astronomical fans, she can't hold a match to Rarity's skill
<Lemon> What just happened? *guy enters strip club, gets ass kicked and chases some girl?*
<DoctorValor> ^
<LGNR> Nowhere at all.
<Zephirdd> IMO
<gingerbrony666> *other
<lastone1376> she's the only one waering plastic
<Octavia> 13The b movie will be after this movie. :P
<Shelltoon> Did that sign read "Atari?"
<DoctorValor> What Octavia said
<mib_5qgerf> A
<Sorakey> whoo Sorakey's here!

<DeadlyPon3> Gross now?
<Khippy> Alrighty, thanks. :3
<everfreenights> THE GUNFIGHTS OF FUTURE CHINa
<Foolonthehillz> Hmm, too many people here for nao
<Silverscreen> 11Dat noise....
<mib_vhad4c> sad
<Saint_Absol> Depending on who you ask, Blade Runner IS the B Movie
<Grundle> I like hares :)

<Zephirdd> Also

<DoctorValor> I promised bronies I would play BO with them
<Lemon> A SNAIL.

<Drakengarde> You know, even though I've never read it
<BakedMacintosh> DON'T WALK
<General_Hazard> Mod's got chat open
<Magneto> Yes, Atari
<Buytoast> L Block.
<Darf14> Wow, I guess Atari still survives in the near future
<Zephirdd> insert glass of wine on my hand
<PonehMan> el block?
<NoOne> dont block
<House> "Don't Walk"
<CrazyPie> Atari
<Cobalt> There we go, switching to low quality fixed it. HQ is down I assume?
<mariomarc> ATATI
<DeadlyPon3> Don't Walk
<Luna> 07after the movies
<Tehpogo> No. Don't walk.
<Rated-RPonyStar> Anybody else see the Atari logo
<mariomarc> ATARI
<sklar> I dont what to do VatltheJean i am retarded at the onlines
<Rated-RPonyStar> ?
<joetraincool> Atari in the background
<trebthegamer> wow there's flying cars and we still have to wait to cross the street?
<C9317> 9 AM eastern time...
<mib_94rb5e> YEAH WHEN
<mib_6x4d3i> it's funny because almost all the companies that are advertised in this movie are now bankrupt
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This is ponies, what are you talking about
<Gnomesmasher> i downloaded so much nsfw just to put on my friends laptop at school
<Robikku> 4+ hours
<C9317> I think
<DashWithRainbows> im looking forward to when the second movies streams, bronystate will will be reduced very fast
<Silverscreen> 11mib_94rb5e: After the movies
<SuperBrony64> mib_94rb5e: At around 11 PM EST
<Luna> 07nope HQ is up
<Rainbow-Dash> I have returned.
<Rohan> What movie is this? Or am I just silly?
<Wrek> 05mib_94rb5e caps doesnt help, only makes me think less of you.
<Foolonthehillz> Ah
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This is the live action they did for Gen 1
<Gnomesmasher> when he opened it the teacher saw\
<djdexcat> Well, I prefer more subtlety to my Grimdark fics. Cupcakes just felt like "Arr, stab stab"
<chedduhr> lol this is weird
<House> Seems kinda dumb
<Quiltone> I did
<Lemon> Best pony episode everypony?
<mib_94rb5e> Ok
<Gnomesmasher> :D
<RainbowDash1> Lauren Faust is best pony
<Troggle> atari again
<DJMidli> I LOVE YOU ALL BUT THERE IS TO MUCH SCROLLING. enjoy the movie night bronies - Bronyradio DJ #2
<Lasharus> Cupcakes has fast become the most controversial tales in the entire fanon. :P
<Meanwhile> Shoot first, questions on deathbed.
<mib_94rb5e> Thatnks
<Drakengarde> I've also sort of had the impression that despite Pinkie's chipper attitude, she knew PRECISELY what she was doing
<Blinky> Yeah
<Foolonthehillz> Will check back then!
<gingerbrony666> Are there other rooms?
<Hat> what year is this set in
<B127> Rohan: Blade Runne
<Magneto> Atari and Coke are not bankrupted.
<MuNova> SOMEONE SAY HOW LONG THIS MOVE IS AND/OR WHEN SEASON 1 STARTS
<mib_94rb5e> SONIC RAINBOOM
<PonehMan> she after me lucky charms!
<RAWRity> so what do you guys think of my fic idea
<MuNova> lol.
<Foolonthehillz> HI DJ
<DeadlyPon3> Seriously, that is really a stupid design for a coat
<shadow_light> err you missed
<House> They show LA's practically owned by the Japanese
<Lemon> Over a Barrel all the way!
<PrincessCelestia> damn
<mariomarc> nice shot
<MrSirPGW> THis chat moves kind of fast, but I have a question: Is the stream supposed to be above the chat window or is it just me?
<Rohan> MOOV, GTFO THAR WAY
<fluttercry> insert guile's theme
<trebthegamer> oh yea
<Nittany_Tiger> Glass!
<WhatPayne> Shooting in crowd...
<pony_yay> EPIC MID-CHASE SHOOTING
<everfreenights> YOU CANT AIM WITH YOUR FUTURE GUN
<Darf14> Fires gun into street, no one gives a s***
<Zed> MAN GUNS DOWN WOMAN IN PUBLIC
<Meanwhile> Derped
<Celestiawesome> Best Night Ever
<Asmalya> suddenly
<lastone1376> and no one get's down
<techdude300> Hey, did you guys hear about the new Atari with 5TB disk?
<Rated-RPonyStar> Ooh whatcha say...
<LGNR> The guy could really use a reflex booster.
<Lemon> When did he get a gun?
<mib_vhad4c> ouch
<BronyQuest> OSHI.
<PonehMan> blat blat that beeyotch
<Marelin> FINISH IT!
<mallam> nice shot!
<C9317> CUPCAKES
<mib_94rb5e> SHE JUST GOT SHOT IN THE BOOB
<mib_6vl8h8> GENDOWNED
<DariustheDragon> Why is indiana jones shooting a girl?
<Navy_Brony> Just because it feels like you ate some bad mushrooms doesn't mean it's a B movie :D
<Asmalya> shoe changes
<Buytoast> He shoots his gun and causes no panic.
<Slowter> She's down
<Zed> "SHE WAS A ROBOT"
<nah> hey, it's that gun.
<SlurryMoon> Bloodsplatter
<PinkamenaDianePie> Doesn't anybody else notice the guy shooting in the middle of the road?
<LGNR> Such terrible aim.
<Asmalya> awww yeah
<BronyumHex> Brohoof crazypie for noticing the atari sign *brohoof*
<MuNova> My favorite episode is Cutie Mark Chronicles
<a041744> Sad music is sad
<Slowter> Boom Headshot
<General_Hazard> Rainbow-Dash is back! yay
<Lasharus> That'd be sensible lastone.
<Ratlan> Is it just me or is it difficult to follow the #BronyState chat?
<Tovler> Firing a gun near a crowd? What is this New York City?
<Tehpogo> music
<Zephirdd> Drakengarde: she does that because "that's how it is"
<fluttercry> insert guile's theme
<Ratlan> I like it
<NoOne> DO A BAREL ROLL
<lastone1376> except her
<SparkCandle> Hey, what version is this? the one I saw didn't include this scene and kinda sucked
<C9317> Anyone here read spiderses yet?
<DashWithRainbows> would be way more blood
<Quiltone> She sorta did Drankengarde, but she didn't realize it was wrong. She thought it was just something she had to do and people onjoyed it. Although that slipped near the end.
<powderedlightning> dramatic gun shot
<mib_94rb5e> POW
<Uh_Maze_Ing> ouuch
<Celestiawesome> Guys, she's a robot. You can shoot robots.
<mib_94rb5e> POW
<Marelin> its the future lol
<Lemon> Blodd?
<C9317> I love it
<BronyQuest> Moar glass.
<Zephirdd> similar to Feeling Pinkie Keen, she won't explain it
<mib_94rb5e> POW
<Meanwhile> herp a derp
<Dermathil> SILVERSCREEN, ATARI PRODUCT PLACEMENT
<DeadlyPon3> They obviously stole this from Battle field EARTH
<Grundle> That's why you should just wear normal clothes
<Marelin> no one minds
<Slowter> And she's still runnnin
<Lemon> *Blood
<Rookeealding> So they got 4 hour life span.... why are they bothering to kill them>
<Suncatcher> it's interesting, but seems difficult to do properly.
<mib_vhad4c> that's actually a near impossible shot
<Applebloom> PCHOO
<Buytoast> Slow motion escape.
<Drakengarde> Huh.
<PonehMan> ooh watcha saaaaaaaaaaaay
<CrazyPie> the blood shows up well in the plastic
<House> She's not human, Dash
<MuNova> I'LL HEAL YOUR BOOB, LADY
<Foxpony> MEDIC!
<Drunkyhhoves> did I miss it?
<mib_94rb5e> Oh
<C9317> spiderses is awesome
<PrincessTrollestia> I listened to the dramatic reading of Spiderses. Priceless
<mariomarc> so what did she do?
<Dermathil> Time for the Explaination of the placement curse!
<Rohan> This guy makes it look like Legolas doesn't use aimbot.
<MightyMatrix> How is she still running?
<shadow_light> glass everywhere
<everfreenights> so remind me, why is he shooting her?
<Zephirdd> and that is a gigantic point on it
<mib_6vl8h8> PEW
<Happy-Kah> dammmm she knows how to take some serious dammage
<Tovler> Is this Battlefield Earth?
<Stonegaze> He is? Oh snap. Let him know that I got my stream working.
<joetraincool> XD this movie is ridiculous
<Aponymous123> Hey, sorakey
<SlurryMoon> Those are some cheap windows
<Drakengarde> Well, like I said, I never actually read the fic
<a041744> So much more dramatic than non breaking glass
<mib_vhad4c> spiderses!!
<Meanwhile> 4 years rookealding
<Lemon> Where the hell is the blood.
<mallam> lol 21 years of unlucky
<Stonegaze> or not..
<powderedlightning> woman stop breaking windows
<House> Again, she's not human
<Foxpony> Activate Ze Ubercharge!
<Darf14> Three plains of glass and two bullet wounds finally took her down
<SuperBrony64> Tovler: Blade Runner
<Lasharus> I still like how Equestria daily tagged Cupcakes.
<MightyMatrix> oh
<Ponybot> bitch got shot
<Ratlan> Why not?
<mib_vhad4c> there's a new trollfic on ff.net
<C9317> I liked Cupcakes
<nah> @everfreenights well, she did just try to kill him.
<Drakengarde> So, to be totally honest, I wouldn't really know.
<Shadowx> well lets all congregate in AJ again so we can make sure octavia isnt lonely :)
<Lasharus> "Grimdark as FUCK"
<Vergil> For some reason, in the future, we apparently still have weak-ass windows.
<Octavia> 13Shes obviously the tank.
<Buytoast> And still nobody is screaming or running away.
<Caboozles> High constitution modifier
<gic1898> Besides, a bullet wound isn't alwys that bloody.
<C9317> it was awesome!
<DSNesmith> Did... did harrison ford just shoot a bitch?
<trebthegamer> you know id pick to be bulletproof instead of a quick shoechange
<Tehpogo> She's one of the replicants he's looking for
<Plankydude> Hi!
<mib_vhad4c> have you rapening?
<DaveKenroy> Sorry, Pizza arrived
<nah> @everfreenights also, robot.
<DariustheDragon> Tittle of movie plz?
<gic1898> *always
<Natleyn> I'm all OTL 'cause I wanna read everything >_>
<Meanwhile> dat plot
<Magneto> Spidersex
<Metostopholes> All was did was be a replicant on earth
<Navy_Brony> I love movies that have such a distinctive film noir tint to it.
<mallam> cupcakes was good
<rivets> everfreenights she's a robot and that's illegal
<Drakengarde> xD
<Slowter> She;s an evil robot that tried to kill him everfreenights
<everfreenights> everfreenights: theres that
<coopm0re> ok NOW hes jc denton
<Plankydude> You guys know me?
<NoOne> i cant eat cupcakes anymore
<Darken_Skye> so this is the final cut cause that was the remastered death scene
<RainbroDash> Yes this movie is weird, but it was hot s**t back in the day.
<Saint_Absol> Please don't mention food, I'm far more hungry than I should be right now
<Lemon> No one even flinches w/ all the bullets and stuff?
<Sir_Hoofalot> she was a filthy replicant
<Troggle> Pretty accurate
<Wrek> 05nope, hai
<LGNR> Why did he kill her, anyway?
<DaveKenroy> Anyway, which fic are we discussing? Cupcakes still?
<DashWithRainbows> he forgot to teabag the body
<kirzstryfe> Pinkie Pie is Pinkie Pie, and if you try to understand her you're oatmeal
<Xzite> lol
<Shelltoon> Snatcher
<Zephirdd> I guess
<LGNR> Was there any reason to?
<Shadowfax> Blade Runner
<Marelin> blade runner
<Marelin> or
<BakedMacintosh> LOL
<Navy_Brony> A Clockwork Orange is another favorite.
<Lasharus> Lucky git.
<ADTR> Spiderses
<Zephirdd> IMO best fic is Past Sins
<Darf14> And no one give's a f***
<Marelin> do androids dream of electric sheep
<fluttercry> Or Adam Jensen
<mib_vhad4c> I can still eat cupcakes
<C9317> I am asking to have spider sex with you twilight
<DSNesmith> she's already wrapped up in the bodybag and everything
<Rohan> His pistols are augmented?
<shadow_light> rape?
<Lasharus> All the takeaways are closed over here, and I'm outta snacks.
<mariomarc> well that's just plaim rasicm
<Lonewanderer118> And everybody just keeps calm and moves along
<MeteorVenture> take care guys i'm off to bed
<DoctorWhooves> 0lol
<Sir_Hoofalot> omg not human!
<a041744> This is the guy with the blade, and he runs
<Diftraku> What has watching CSI and Dexter tought us?
<Jaguar_> My vision is augmented
<DSNesmith> that's how real men do it
<Puppy> boredom probs
<SilkAMV> I tend to not like bridging the pony-human gap. But that kind of story could ironically show why it's a bad idea.
<House> HA
<mib_vhad4c> cupcakes cupcakes CUPCKAES
<Troggle> I think?
<rivets> not evil, just misunderstood
<DSNesmith> they make the murder victim package themselves
<DeadlyPon3> Obviously, that coat is already on it's way to the dry cleaner
<gingerbrony666> mallam. Seriously? You thought cupcakes was good?
<Wrek> 05what a sahme
<Lasharus> More or less. Though you have a PM Dave. :P
<Wrek> 05shame*
<PinkamenaDianePie> SUDDENLY SNOW
<Zephirdd> altho I havent read that many fics
<Tehpogo> The original cut had a voiceover of Harrison going "I just shot a woman in the back. I am sad now."
<Zephirdd> :P
<Tovler> SuperBrony64: A skanky person running through glass a lot? Pretty sure it's Battlefield Earth
<Lemon> There are all the people!
<Shadowx> oh my chat lag D:
<Quiltone> What's even funnier is now every PieDash ship out there references it somehow. Pinkie has a bad dream, Rainbow freaks out thinking Pinkie would hutr her, etc etc
<Ratlan> The difference between a well made story and a childish, immature story is the difference between Cupcakes and Apple Acres Massacre.
<SilkAMV> How does Lyra fit in? I'd imagine she plays a pretty important role.
<MrPoniator_> lol
<BakedMacintosh> MOVE ON
<SirReginald> move on, move on...
<Slowter> Just another day in New York
<mib_6vl8h8> MOVEON
<Stargazer> was wondering why he blew her away
<NewDCD> okay it works now
<PonehMan> move on or get shot
<mib_6vl8h8> MOVEON
<everfreenights> move on, move on, move on
<herospirit> Um, I'd just like to inform the mods that the links in the theater to the rooms didn't work for me, and I had to manually add "applejack" to the URL to get in here
<MightyMatrix> Move On
<mib_6vl8h8> MOVEON
<Applebloom> Move on
<Natleyn> Well, for one, she tried to kill him
<Shadowx> lol video freezed for a min and soo did chat
<MrPoniator_> There was gun shooting and all they say is "Move on"
<Darf14> I guess he has a license to kill
<NewDCD> everything is in working order
<a041744> NOTHING TO SEE HERE FOLKS!
<Rookeealding> move on... move on... right.
<Drakengarde> Past Sins...xD Oh god. Never read that one either
<Rohan> SNOW?
<SuperBrony64> Tovler: Haha, okay.
<General_Hazard> Time for noodles
<Khippy> Such an awkward movie.
<fluttercry> she clicked the wrong Aug
<DashWithRainbows> or just hosed down
<DashWithRainbows> because its plastic
<C9317> Cupcakes was great
<mallam> yes it was good
<djdexcat> Eh, yeah, DaveKenroy. It's kind of a hard subject to get away from.
<Rated-RPonyStar> Move on, just a dead artificial body
<mib_vhad4c> its LA
<MrMaxaminus> move on...move on...move on...
<Rated-RPonyStar> nothing to see here
<BakedMacintosh> Also, more product placement :)
<mariomarc> omg that'd hilarious
<MrMaxaminus> EYEPATCH
<DrActivisionary> ...
<C9317> not disturbing at all
<mallam> well good plot i guess
<Vergil> As a writer, I abhor cupcakes.
<Stonegaze> Live on!
<trebthegamer> i don't know why but that "move on" car was hilarius
<coopm0re> yeah but this looks more like deus ex 1
<mib_vhad4c> not NY
<Octavia> 13lol
<SlurryMoon> Eyepatch, ahoy!
<Drakengarde> But I LOL at all the reag that Nyx gets
<Wrek> 05I shouldnt have to tell you not to skeep saying move on right? RIGHT?
<Lasharus> NewDCD, you're a mod! Change your colour! :P
<Navy_Brony> lol
<Vergil> It's the equivalent of the "Human Centipede".
<mallam> plot twist
<Meanwhile> Budweiser tastes like the sweat on the floor of a changing room.
<DaveKenroy> Ooh, another fic I loved was Storm
<Octavia> 13A clockwork Orange is a good movie.
<everfreenights> thank you eye-patched liquor lady
<DoctorWhooves> 0lol
<Caboozles> Clockwork Orange...
<MuNova> move on
<MuNova> move on
<MuNova> move on
<Caboozles> Heh.
<Veewave> I love product placement.
<DariustheDragon> ONMOVE, oh, wait thats not it...
<PonehMan> IT'S TWILIGHT SPORKLES BALLEWN!
<Lasharus> You're confusing us normal people. :P
<RainbroDash> Sadface?
<Troggle> Yeah, I read it more to get the references in other stuff
<Darf14> Budweiser exist in the future, no surprise there
<techdude300> This future sucks. I blame our president for no reason.
<Caboozles> I'll be down for AJ too.
<Caboozles> Yeah, it really is
<Gnomesmasher> apple fritters D:
<gingerbrony666> mallam why?
<Spazturtle> Budweiser product placment
<DaveKenroy> Past Sins, I loved that one
<Caboozles> weird as hell though
<BronyumHex> you gotta love that guys origami animals
<Vergil> No narrative, no lessons to be learned, just scenes meant for nothing but shock value.
<Tehpogo> Yeah. It was phoned in pretty badly.
<powderedlightning> arrg i patch
<C9317> Human centipede was funny
<Metostopholes> I've never seen the original cut, but I really want to
<Shadowx> only awkward if you make it... :)
<Troggle> Haven't read many other fics though
<Gnomesmasher> SOMETIMES I THROW UP
<Meanwhile> skinjob
<Quiltone> haven't read that one
<Navy_Brony> Oh yeah
<LGNR> But why is that a reason to kill her? Isn't he a cop?
<House> >No Narrative
<Ratlan> He was just called a skinjob...
<Metostopholes> Just to know
<Darf14> Never saw human Centipede
<House> Are you high, bro?
<DoctorWhooves> 0i liked "the vinyl scratch tapes"
<Cobalt> I'd like to watch the stream in HQ, if I keep getting the time out is there any way for me to or am I stuck on LQ?
<Tehpogo> Taking out the voiceovers is pretty much the best thing about the recut
<NewDCD> 9yeah I know
<General_Hazard> One question...
<Foxpony> I like his hat
<mariomarc> should have played that
<C9317> I still laugh whenever I think of it
<Rohan> Get to tha choppah....?
<HeartString> human centipede was a great movie!
<House> OH
<Lonewanderer118> I'm not entirely certain whats happening in the movie
<mallam> the author put a lot of time into it
<Fluttershy`> House hehe I like your name
<djdexcat> As much as I liked Past Sins, I sadly saw the ending coming from a mile away.
<coopm0re> i heard about human centipede from the yogpod
<Khippy> AJ is best. :3
<DashWithRainbows> i have never had an apple fritter
<RAWRity> that's essentially my goal. to highlight the ...less than savory things some people have come up with related to ponies. The only thing I'm not touching on is clopfics, because I would never be able to write anything of the sort without just outright hating myself
<House> OOPS
<NewDCD> 9was just stressed with my flash crashing
<mallam> maybe
<General_Hazard> how do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?
<DashWithRainbows> might try one

<Rated-RPonyStar> Yeah, but the build up to it was good

<MrSirPGW> Is the chat window supposed to be below the stream, or is something wrong with the layout of my page?
<mariomarc> wtf
<everfreenights> FOR THAT, YOU DIE
<Ponybot> That was the book this movie was based on wasn't it?
<Starchaser> just watched an episode of g1 my little pony
<SilkAMV> No, you certainly should have clop-fics have an effect. But only in a humorous way. It's perfectly possible to have sexual tension without anything explicit happening, or even questionable.
<Khippy> 9AM EST, I think
<DoctorWhooves> 0yeah, but the build-up was done VERY good
<Baron_von_Brony> steam punch?

<Sandman> so, where is everyone from?
<MightyMatrix> She wears that big coat alot
<djdexcat> I looked at Past Sins the way I looked at Party of One. Even though the ending was obvious, the trip there caught me off guard.
<Zephirdd> lol
<Shadowx> hero same here
<Silverscreen> 11whoops.
<Mastertortilla27> We should watch Soldier after this, it's in the same universe.
<coopm0re> 0i tend to not read rules
<Magneto> Guy got shot from the behind, big ass exit-wound on his front side: Harrison Ford: Unharmed
<DashWithRainbows> go into bronystate for 5 seconds and see the spam
<Saint_Absol> I like how string instruments sound; and I'm biased toward Earth Ponies
<Dermathil> I just told him, Silverscreen.
<gic1898> Has she ever heard of overpenetration?
<Muffin> Rarity is best marshmellow.
<UltimaGalaxy> MARK!!
<MrSirPGW> mib_eyn0hr Haha, that was simple. Thanks
<Diftraku> This reminds me a bit of Die Hard movies...
<Ponybot> super appropriate movie before non-stop ponies
<everfreenights> "Whens my birthday? you forgot again! didn't you!?" PUNCH
<VicViper> why does that guy keep getting his ass kicked
<Ratlan> Aye
<mib_9lq815> Sure..democracy...democracy which was set up by the tyrant Celestia!
<RAWRity> well...there's a BIT of something like that in there, between 2 characters I will not name...actually you just gave me a great idea. BRB WRITING DOWN THIS DISTURBING/HOPEFULLY AWESOME IDEA
<Sir_Hoofalot> love that lighting
<Darf14> I had to look away for a couple of seconds
<Combustiblelemons> streams not working for me
<Tehpogo> And to think that's her INDOOR coat.
<Stonegaze> Dammit. I missed so much of the story I can't connect to it.
<coopm0re> 0I HAD FIGURED THIS OUT BY NOW
<nah> @magneto you did this didn't you
<Caboozles> I used to like Fluttershy
<Khippy> :P
<JewelsFriend> so in the future all drinks are consumed from impressionist shot-glasses?
<Ratlan> Though I just had an interesting thought.
<Zephirdd> I actually had adrenaline rushes reading it
<Foxpony> Naah, gotta watch Super mario Bros!
<katycupcake> can someone please explain to me when the new episode is supposed to air on the Hub? I have that channel but I'm not seeing it planned for tonight or tomorrow
<Zephirdd> >_>
<Luna> 07Combustiblelemons which site are you at?
<Tovler> We should watch The Rock in honor of Michael. (It's the only watchable Bay movie)
<nah> @combustiblelemons switch to lowquality
<DoctorWhooves> 0i don't like to read grimdark,
<Lunasta> Is it bad that I always read Boom, headshot in the Sniper's voice?
<chedduhr> and now I'm out of popcorn...
<Venger> season two is just around the corner!!
<Caboozles> But then I realized Apple Bloom was far cuter.
<Caboozles> Braver.
<Celestia> Celestia isn't a tyrant. Luna is just a jealous bitch.
<herospirit> Glad to know it's not just me :p
<Caboozles> And everything.
<Ratlan> Ponified version of Coupling?
<Jessim> When Bridge to TeraBithya came out
<Meanwhile> Burn your stream down with lemons
<Jessim> That kid Jesse
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol...whatever you do...DON'T share it with me :P
<Combustiblelemons> dinkypage
<Waifles> Prove to me that Celestia is a Tyrant
<Jessim> Looked exactly like me
<Drakengarde> brb
<SlurryMoon> Light...
<powderedlightning> AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT STILL DDOESNT KNOW WHATS GOING ON
<Meanwhile> Celestia is a douche
<chedduhr> well it was better than the popcorn I burnt this morning...
<PinkamenaDianePie> Lies.
<Choco> I don't have the Hub :(
<DoctorWhooves> 0well, the doctor whooves I read, but thats about it
<mib_6vl8h8> Go home and be a family man!
<General_Hazard> I love Alan Rickman
<Foxpony> or how about some Rocky Horror Picture Show!
<Zephirdd> goddamnit I hate that book so much I love it
<DashWithRainbows> the Reanimtor is way better than this
<Tovler> Already saw Super Mario Bros
<mallam> according to this movie we will have flying cars in 8 years
<Luna> 07switch to bronystate.net
<desertman2> we already saw that, Foxpony
<Meanwhile> Oh she's here
<Buytoast> Along with life's house
<fluttercry> the business of banging robots
<Meanwhile> TO the the moooooooon
<Zecora> i watched everything and i can't connect to ot
<MrMaxaminus> IT'S BUSINESS TIME
<mallam> thats great!
<coopm0re> 0ohey guys add me on steam, coopmore
<House> Ford's character is hunting replicants, They both might be replicants,
<Lasharus> Grimdark does depress a bit too much, I'll grant.
<House> There, now you know
<Drake> thats why i bought 4 bags of popcorn
<Darf14> *looks around the corner* Hey your right
<Foxpony> oh god...the cast of Rocky Horror as ponies...
<Jaguar_> Do you like mmmm bananas?
<EmmettBrown> In the future,fruit has been genetically engineered to provide a 4 course meal
<Quiltone> I generally avoid Grimdark because it's dull. Oh yay, beloved character gets murdered horribly.
<Waifles> you can't because there is no proof, BTW it's no democracy there. it's Feudalism, that's why she's a princess.
<Rookeealding> yes I'm in the buisness and buisness is good
<Rohan> ....
<gingerbrony666> What's the running time for Blade Runner?
<Lightning_Flicker> Good thing those wounds heal up might quick!
<Celestia> Celestia is the best pony.
<Combustiblelemons> ok, all working now
<shadow_light> light vs dark
<everfreenights> TIME FOR BUISINESS
<DoctorWhooves> 0lol
<Slowter> Don't question powderedlightning, just accept
<chedduhr> lol
<Lonewanderer118> I don't know whtas happening either
<Zephirdd> not all grimdark are like that
<Shadowx> i like all of them haha
<Foxpony> has anyone done that yet?
<Ivan> how much longer till the movie is over?
<Graffy_Hooves> powderedlightning yes yes you are
<DoctorWhooves> 0exactly
<Xzite> ^
<Stonegaze> Righty-ho.
<Octavia> 13Fluttershy is my fav of the mane6, and Octavia is my overall fav obviously. :P
<mariomarc> how long is the intermission
<Meanwhile> Celestia is still a douche.
<trebthegamer> ohh big buisness
<DoctorWhooves> 0and the ponies begin
<Rated-RPonyStar> Quite a while Ivan
<Metostopholes> Shit, I forgot to make popcorn
<djdexcat> I only read GrimDark if I'm in the mood for it. And if it's particularly well-written.
<Venger> longlive the Luna Republic
<PinkamenaDianePie> Excuse me but I am clearly the best pony.
<SirDerpsalot> Eight years? My projections concluded we'd have flying cars in only four.
<Waifles> Also, Luna tried to kill every living thing. she deserved more than just imprisonment on the moon.
<lastone1376> in the futrue is everything metal?
<EmmettBrown> ut,who would Frank-N-Furter be?
<RAWRity> i don't know what Coupling is...
<DaveKenroy> I like the grimdark like Silent Ponyville
<mib_9lq815> I want someone to write a fic where they are both eveil ( :
<mallam> Blade Runner has about 50 minutes left i think
<mariomarc> i have to make dinner after
<PrincessCelestia> :(
<Combustiblelemons> whats tonights lineup? i forgot :S
<Spazturtle> Magneto have you ever seen a gun shot wound, that is what they are like, the bullet will still be inside him but the fource will make a big hole.
<Quiltone> No Zephirdd they aren't. And the ones I like usually aren't.
<CrazyPie> 2 hrs
<Vergil> Magneto is new best troll in equestria.
<Applebloom> Celestia smells funny
<DashOrCrash> How do I join a specific room, like fluttershy/etc?
<nah> @waifles wouldn't it be more like a democratic monarchy
<Metostopholes> Indeed, how long?
<DashWithRainbows> >still does not know the characters as im focusing mostly on chat and making a CV
<kirzstryfe> there are some good grimdark that don't involve pony deaths
<Xzite> nah, chrome :D
<Rohan> Did anyone put the "No wars over leaders in the theater" sign at the entrance?
<everfreenights> BUT WHO IS RIF RAF
<SirDerpsalot> This is Blade Runner?
<Lemon> FURRY COATS SO CUTE WE'LL BLOW YOUR MI-INDS!
<Uh_Maze_Ing> what year is this movie set in?
<chedduhr> LET'S ALL GO TO THE LOBBY..........
<Waifles> Luna is of course, in this context, quite the evil pony.
<Meanwhile> Cry me a river Celestia.
<Zed> Her shoulders are space marine material.
<everfreenights> damn!
<Ratlan> It's a comedy
<C9317> I think fluttershy should rule equestria
<Zephirdd> I avoid grimdark anyways tho
<SuperBrony64> SirDerpsalot: Yup.
<Xzite> everything in the future is chrome
<DSNesmith> more blood spray from a headshot
<Tovler> Meanwhile: Celestia is poorly written, but not a douche
<Ponybot> about 87 hours left of the movie
<Grundle> Yuck.
<Flutterrage> No, I'm the best pony.
<Darf14> That women looks menacing for some reason
<lastone1376> some grimdark here
<Navy_Brony> but yeah, Blade Runner, A Clockwork Orange, Apocalypse Now, and Mulholland Drive are all crazy, trippy movies.
<Slowter> I think Derpy Hooves is by far the best pony
<DSNesmith> that was remarkably clean
<BlankFlankBrony> SirDerpsalot: Yup.
<DeadlyPon3> Mmm, my Finger is tasty
<Zephirdd> I prefer comedy or normal stories :P
<General_Hazard> 2019
<SirDerpsalot> Riff and raff both have two r's.
<mariomarc> making pasta
<Shadowx> fluttershy and pinkie, i wish i could look at them the same after reading cupcakes and pancakes
<DashWithRainbows> 8 years from now
<Lonewanderer118> Drowned
<Quiltone> In the future, women have HUGE shoulders.
<House> 2019
<Graffy_Hooves> baisically that chicks a robot along with the two that just got killed Harrison ford's job is to kill rogue robots
<DashWithRainbows> but was made in 1984
<DoctorWhooves> 0O.K. thats one exeption, i might read that when its done
<nah> @tovler how is celly poorly written
<Foxpony> Riff Raff = Pinkie Pie?
<MightyMatrix> Theirs a intermission between this movie and the next one right?
<Lasharus> Aww, not firefox Xzite?
<Lonewanderer118> Or not
<fluttercry> I don't know I just clicked fluttershy and I have both rooms at the top
<Navy_Brony> ...and 2001: A Space Odyssey
<Caboozles> A great, great movie.
<coopm0re> 0hey guys im gonna brb
<House> 1982
<Darken_Skye> I don't understand why people find it so hard to follow this movies narrative structure. but anytime I watch it with a group there is at least one person who has a hard time keeping up with the plot
<gingerbrony666> Who is the worst pony? ;)
<Stonegaze> Dun dun duuun!
<Caboozles> One Flew Over

<DSNesmith> Coupling...?
<Luna_peek> we are on a tight schedule tonight
<General_Hazard> *ahem*
<Meanwhile> Tovler, all i've seen of Celestia makes me conclude her douchiness, seriously, i can't think of her without wanting to slap her in the face.
<DashOrCrash> I did the same, but I only have "bronystate"
<Zephirdd> but I didnt like the game nor the movie
<SirDerpsalot> You can't disappear by going North. >.>
<Khippy> Shadow, I watched gameplay of Luna

<Vergil> Kamiya is best pony.
<SilkAMV> Owlowiscious is a he. They say it in the show.

<DeadlyPon3> *AHEM* COUGH *AHEM*
<chedduhr> yeah looks like you are...

<Meanwhile> Celestia < Magneto.
<Diftraku> Does anyone have mindbleach handy?
<Thetrollside> OH FUCK WE BROKE #))
<General_Hazard> Next up is My Little Pony The Movie
<tieflingbutterfly> It's a little hard to follow the movie if you've read the book first, since it varies so much.
<Luna> 07SuperBrony64 stop with the caps please
<Slowter> One? I think he owes her a lil' more for saving his life.
<Quiltone> SH2 was an awesome game, and the movie wasn't terrible as game movies go
<techdude300> Ponybot: How do YOU know magnets aren't god?
<Khippy> Don't wanna know.
<Saint_Dane> Rarity is best everyone knows that, why is it evena discussion
<Rated-RPonyStar> Best normal fic ever
<gingerbrony666> AJ is best pony purely cuz she's a Badass Normal with no supernatrual powers
<BronyGuy> Lasharus i see what you did there...
<RayneJCyro> Talk about ironic, I just finished watching this liike fifteen minutes ago XD
<mib_9lq815> I'm still hoping Luna was corrupted by an outside force...John de Lancie for example
<Dermathil> >mfw TaraStrong
<a041744> rainbow, type /join #channelname

<Choco> Rainbow Dash will always be the best
<Shelltoon> At the gala, with magneto, is where I'm going to be. We will talk all about magnets and mutant powers too.
<Quetzaltcoatl> magneto is best pony
<Caboozles> Horror game. Pony style.
<Natleyn> Owlowiscious... dat name.
<VioletVanilla> 6Octavia is my favorite too~ ;3 Mmmhmmmhmmmmmmmmmm~
<Thetrollside> WHEN THE FUCK DID WE BREAK 300
<Rohan> I think I'll go in my bunker before people start shooting guns over best pony.
<Luna_peek> lol
<Khippy> Yup.
<Celestia> Nah, Celestia > All
<djdexcat> Agreed, Quiltone
<Elky> all background ponies are annoying
<Thetrollside> 500*
<LightningThorn> ohh what movie is this?
<SimplyMilk> Just to clarify, Season 2 will be shown right here, right?
<billy> "halo stuff"
<Vergil> "This horn, is the horn that will pierce the heavens!"
<Caboozles> >Rainbow Dash.
<Thetrollside> jesus christ
<Tovler> nah: not saying that Phil is a phoenix, and not knowing what Parasprites are. Her personality is based more on the plot of the particular episode.
<Caboozles> >good
*Rohan then proceeds into said bunker
<Uh_Maze_Ing> but next year we all die! D:
<Dermathil> TheTrollside: during the pre-show
<DashWithRainbows> @General_Hazard oh god
<DeadlyPon3> But wait, shouldn't we be under monkey rule by then?
<Like_a_BAWSS> I'm kinda bored
<Meanwhile> Celestia is a douche.
<Buytoast> Background Pony #15A6XG7 is the best pony.
<Luna> 07correct
<Caboozles> Nooooope
<Foxpony> rainbow rash would be Frank-N-Furter ^^
<Khippy> What Cabooz said.
*Lasharus grins wickedly at BronyGuy.
<KingGummy341> Twilight FTW
<General_Hazard> Then in 3000... Futurama B)
<SirDerpsalot> beep boop
<Darf14> Magneto?....oh I remember now
<TaraStrong> Yes it will
<PrincessCelestia> Erecting a erection.
<Dermathil> yes, Simplymilk
<Luna> 07we will stream season 2 LIVE!
<House> Fun fact: Deckard's police car appears in Back to the Future's 2015
<fluttercry> How dare you insult Doctor Whoof!
<Blinky> Silent Hill 2 is excellent
<SirDerpsalot> boop beep bop
<Foxpony> Spike and twilight would be Brad and Janet
<DSNesmith> you're a policeman!
<Shadowx> oh lol
<cbpony9001> luna 2012
<House> CANON CROSSOVER
<Caboozles> Honestly

<Octavia> 13lol VV :P
<Celestia> Celestia is a god. Gtfo.
<tieflingbutterfly> LightningThorn, this is Blade Runner.
<DoctorWhooves> 0Did anyone read the one where Derpy has the same day everyday, and that day is when Nitemare Moon comes?
<Caboozles> I like Octavia's design a lot
<Lemon> It's gonna be so special, as Magneto gives a gun to meeeeeeee!
<Jaguar_> Twilight is best pony
<DashWithRainbows> cant be bothered to type tons of stuff of halo story
<desertman2> What if we talk about best channel?
<Shadowx> i liked the nes style applebloom game
<Luna> 07this room is nice and calm
*TaraStrong is waiting for the mare-athon
<BronyumHex> lol
<BronyumHex> LOL
<BronyumHex> CLESTIA WORKS FOR TYRELL COR lol
<Tovler> Background Ponies should be voiced by girl bronies from now on.
<Caboozles> But I simply don't get the fascination with BG characters.
<a041744> Silly buytoast, the fandom has given every background pony a name!
*Luna is pleased
<EmmettBrown> Anyone know what the spider fanfic is called?
<General_Hazard> When MLP the Movie starts playing... all hope will be lost
<StarPlatinum> Thank you very much. It started in Firefox.
<LightningThorn> what movie is this?
<LGNR> Obvious plot twist incoming.
<SuperBrony> I never saw G1
<crickettwb> Rolls right off of the tongue.
<Caboozles> They have no character.
<Meanwhile> Celestia is god of douche land.
<chedduhr> lol that would be awesome
<C9317> Fluttershy
<Caboozles> Story of the Blanks
<Rated-RPonyStar> Yeah, I didn't like it
<Metostopholes> Zzzzz
<fluttercry> just like fluttershy
<Rohan> K.
<C9317> best pony
<DeadlyPon3> So...in the year 1 million we will be ruled by giraffes?
<Troggle> Haven't heard of that one
<kirzstryfe> when you say not as terrible as game movies go... that's still a pretty deep hole lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Combustiblelemons: check your PM please. Thank you
<Darf14> It was funny when Magneto was on the pony store
<mariomarc> is she a replicant?
<Vergil> "We've evolved higher than we were one second before! With each step we move farther! THAT is how a Unicorn works!"
<mib_1721oi> celestia dawning
<SirDerpsalot> Rade blunner.
<DashWithRainbows> but wait!!
<Mastertortilla27> If I may ask, do we have a specific time for season 2 airing?
<Luna> 07indeed
<RAWRity> it's hard as hell to spell. I eventually resorted to typing "owlboy" for my fic, and then just doing a Find/Replace for it later.
<nah> @tovler she knew it'd freak the cast out, and that was for twi's benefit.
<BronyGuy> Lasharus How do you do that?
<fluttercry> coincidence?
<Ziltoid> dat sax
<gic1898> Deckard's gun appears in a few Fallout games.
<DashWithRainbows> theres a mute button
<mib_6vl8h8> Ooooh, plot twist
<Uh_Maze_Ing> why? whats wrong with the movie?
<Quiltone> No Doc, but now I want to. Groundhog Day+Derpy=awesome
<VioletVanilla> 6Season 2 will be live here tomorrow at 9AM EST!
<Khippy> I hope Octavia appears in S2.
<Tehpogo> I've never been able to get through the G1 movie all the way
<C9317> Scootaloo is best chicken though
<Rohan> RANDOM JAZZ?
<Thetrollside> OH DEAR GOD THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE AND NO SILVERMANE TO SMACK
<chedduhr> I saw some G1, it's actually alright
<prince-dari> No problem.
<Vergil> "Who the pony do you think I AM!?"
<Misha> Saw G1 as a kid, hated it
<KingGummy341> Trollestia
<cbpony9001> what did i miss
<lunamoonie> oh goodness, i cant wait for the mlp movie
<shadow_light> hes O U T out
<DeadlyPon3> And 4 billions years from now, we will be served by cat nurse aliens in another galaxy
<Tehpogo> Not that I've tried particularly hard
<DashWithRainbows> so no listening to bad ponies voices
<Kyrii> Crap, gotta wake up early >.>
<Mastertortilla27> Ooh splendid, thank you.
<SirDerpsalot> I HAVE CLASS AT 9 AM
<MrMaxaminus> Dat chest hair
<Stargazer> the MLP movie I've seen already, I'll see it again too lol
<Celestia> More like god of being the best pony. Man, these are getting lame.
<Lasharus> Use /me (message)
<chedduhr> G3 is what sucks
<MightyMatrix> When did the future in Back to the Future take place?
<techdude300> futuristic black and white photos
<Happy-Kah> i don't know octavia
<DashWithRainbows> its g3
<mib_9lq815> ...uh...what is that Central?
<SirDerpsalot> SON OF A B****!
<datbrony> the waiting is killing me!
<Buytoast> Scootalo is the best dodo too.
<Puppy> lol
<Tehpogo> It's certainly not as bad as G3
<mariomarc> i watched a commentary of it
<nah> @tovler she was flying over ponyville, of course she could see everything. if she admitted that twi would have an even worse breakdown.
<Caboozles> She's a BG char.
<Lasharus> I.e. /me is getting a drink, would lead to:
<everfreenights> "I have to kill all the cyborgs!" but decard, you are the cyborg" and then decard was a cyborg.
<Zecora> it'S G1
<DoctorWhooves> 0Its...a little sad at the end...
<Caboozles> If anything, she might appear once.
*TaraStrong : when will the marathon begin?
*Lasharus is getting a drink
<crickettwb> Wait, do I hear sax?
<[ger]Brony1> Dat old photos
<trebthegamer> wow that's kind of amazing
<Diftraku> The MLP Movie? Disturbing lack of G4
<BakedMacintosh> 2015
<House> 2015
<DashWithRainbows> any pony before g4 is bad
<mib_9lq815> I suck at figuring out time zones
<Flameshy> i like it
<Nyx> :O
<Meanwhile> Celestia is always lame.
<Happy-Kah> ahh cool
<Lonewanderer118> I left for 2 minutes, what happened
<Quiltone> lol yeah kirzstryfe. But I actually enjoyed watching it
<Colin> so glad Season 2 starts on a weekend!
<Lemon> When is Season 1 starting
<Caboozles> That's really all I expect
<JewelsFriend> smooth jazz will be deployed now...
<shadow_light> 525
<DashWithRainbows> G4 is FiM
<Shadowx> dat music lol
<nah> @tovler forgot a comma in there.
<mib_lcrply> it is decided, veemi just hates me
<mariomarc> also G1 has some pretty awesome villains
<House> Everything went to shit in four years apparently
<RayneJCyro> Fluttershy is best Tree.
<MightyMatrix> wow
<Ohai> Episodic-type stuff is my favorite kind of fanfiction. personally.
<Tovler> nah: too many pronouns, what?
<SirDerpsalot> In one month's time.
<Darken_Skye> I work at 9:30 but I think I can watch the stream on my phone
<mib_d7a9j0> FOR ALL PPL WHO THINK THEY HAVE KLASS, ITS SATURDAY TOMORROW LOL
<mib_k0pv3d> SOOOOOOOO MANY BRONIES @____@
<Dermathil> TaraStrong: when the movies are done
<Misha> Saw G3 wanted to kill myself so badly
<Metostopholes> I've never seen any MLP before FiM... little sister was never into it
<EmmettBrown> If only we could link things,I could show you a picture of real chest hair!
<Blinky> I've never seen a good game movie
<RAWRity> that is a very hairy chest he has there
<VioletVanilla> 6Marethon begins at 11EST
<mib_lcrply> on all browsers, on both computers
*Silverscreen 11is using the /me command
<Waifles> BTW, before we forget. Luna didn't spend 1000 years on the moon. It was Nightmare Moon, The mare in the Moon who did. So all those pictures depicting the lonely Luna on the Moon is in fact pure fanon fabrication. It was Nightmare Moon, and there's a big difference.
<Nyst> In the future, black and white photographs come back in style
*BronyGuy oh
<Vergil> Everfree: Oh my god. Thank you for reminding me of that meme.
<herospirit> And then John was a zombie.
<Darf14> Season 1 starts after G1
<cbpony9001> Luna is best pony
<Flameshy> yes i know :)
<Dermathil> in about 3 hours
<VioletVanilla> 6 11PM EST
<MrSirPGW> I cannot into time zones. How many hours till 9 AM EST?
<mib_lcrply> even the googlcached version won't load
<mib_5enmug> what time does the marathon on here start
<DoctorWhooves> 0Res evil?
<C9317> I have no classes tommorrow!
*djdexcat didn't know how to do that either
<Lasharus> See? Silverscreen got it.
<chedduhr> I grew up seeing the commercials for g3, but I never payed attention to it in general
<Dyonus> I should have waited to do my Ponyathon until tonight. :-(
<lunamoonie> well, g2 wasnt that ba
<BronyGuy> I get it!
*TaraStrong : I'm guessing after this movie that most of us are not interested in
<Spazturtle> Lonewanderer118 he had sex with the robot
<Dermathil> SILVERMANE ISN'T THERE
<gdpony> I wonder how many people will be watching this...
<C9317> awesome!
<RobotPinkie> <3 herospirit
<SirDerpsalot> I have classes on Saturday, herp derp.
<lunamoonie> *bad
<HeartString> central time is at 7 am
<mariomarc> watch the G1 pilot it is great
<VioletVanilla> 6Marethon begins at 11PM EST
<RobotPinkie> why wub woo
<Lasharus> Even though his separate text colour confuses. :P
<Quiltone> The first 2 RE movies were OK
<Tehpogo> You really want pain? Try the G3.5 MLP Newborn Cuties
<Khippy> So are other ponies.
<datbrony> bronies, bronies everywhere!
<DoctorWhooves> 0that one was cool
<DJBrony> Celestia = troll
<mallam> @cbpony9001 agree
<Dundrio> How far are we into the movie?
<Octavia> 13Itd be really awesoem if they took my name for her and used it in S2. lol
<MightyMatrix> we are no where close to have some of the stuff in Back to the Future 2
<Suzu> how much longer is this?
<Thetrollside> NEW LUNAR REPUBLIC IS BEST REPUBLIC
<Colin> I'm not sure whats going on at all, i don't even know what the movie is!
*Silverscreen 11knew about /me
<nah> @tovler celestia was flying over ponyvile. she could see everything. celestia lied to twilight for the latter's benefit.
<trebthegamer> i would like to request the cupcake song on the piano
<Rohan> This movie has more twists and turns than... I dunno.
<mib_9lq815> ty
<Rainbow> can someone get me into the dash channel please
<Stargazer> G1 is ok IMO, everything after that till G4 was pretty meh though
<DJBrony> trollestia
<Celestia> Exactly. She needs more screen time. Celestia could be 80327498264982364x better if she had an episode.
<Slowter> Put yo Hooves up!
<Lonewanderer118> Spazturtle Oh cool
<mib_9lq815> I'm still hoping Luna was corrupted by an outside force...John de Lancie for example
<SirReginald> I'm interested.
<everfreenights> HUSH NOW QUIET NOW
<Dermathil> TaraStrong: the other movie is actually bearable
<fluttercry> far
*Jessim loves the /me command
<Jaguar_> ~13 Hours until S2
<Misha> That's what i saw....
<mariomarc> i saw that
<nah> @tovler better?
<MightyMatrix> 50mins
<mariomarc> don't mention it again
<Flameshy> hahahah XD
<gic1898> G3.5...*shudder*
<House> They're making self tying shoes
<SirDerpsalot> I done told you, it's rade blunner.
<Shadowx> haha isnt there going to be more derpy?
<KingGummy341> What pony would you fuck if you could
<General_Hazard> Nike's releasing a limited number of self-lacing hoes
<Khippy> But they showed up in tons of episodes.
<Jace-Arveduin> so wats playin?
<billy> ive only seen the newer ones when i saw ads for the toys years ago i was like wtf get this shit away
*Natleyn hugs RobotPinkie and herospirit
<DeadlyPon3> Sorry, I just heard the romance music, what did I miss?
<General_Hazard> *shoes
<Caboozles> I doubt she'll even have a role other than maybe show up in a scene.
<Vergil> Walfles: Agreed. They should have been pics of Nightmare Moon scribbling "I hate celestia" and "Death to the sun" instead.
<BakedMacintosh> G3 was terrible IMO
<Khippy> Like BonBon and Lyra.
<C9317> Celestia, knows twilight has five friends...
<Caboozles> Derpy won't speak
<Tehpogo> Starring Rainbow Dash, the stupid, selfish vain pro-segregationist.
<PonehMan> wut
<LGNR> Blade Runner is 113 minutes
<Blinky> The RE movies were watchable, but I wouldn't say they were good
*Lasharus salutes Silverscreen for his unearthly knowledge.
<House> Look it up, Nike got the patent in 2009
<Thetrollside> SILVERSCREEN
<Buytoast> Gummy
<SirDerpsalot> What's wrong with you?
<Hat> everfreenights: ITS TIME TO GO TO SLEEP
<nah> @kinggummy341 get out
<C9317> sends her two tickets
<PinkamenaDianePie> Someone needs to put that saxophone out of its misery.
<Caboozles> She'll play a 'Where's Waldo' role.
<kirzstryfe> the res evil franchise has gone downhill in the last few years :(
<Rated-RPonyStar> on a scale of one to five I'd give this women a 3
<Drake> yeah, i heard you're supposed to ignore G3
<Lemon> Everypony, favorite pony quote?
<chedduhr> oh great now I need brain bleach
<everfreenights> that question is sick
<billy> 150 on ebay to raise funds
<LGNR> We're about 70 minuites in
<lunamoonie> oh god dont even mention g3.5
<DashWithRainbows> lets face it, the best thing that will come out of 2010-2020 is MLP FiM
<Thetrollside> i can go into dash channel? 8D
*RobotPinkie hugs back
<VioletVanilla> 6What i your name for her Octavia?
<SuperBrony64> KingGummy34: That's not appropriate...
<stripes> well, bronys im off for a while, catch yuz later bye from downunder!
<Shadowx> awww

<C9317> obvious troll is obvious
<mib_79npkj> Aaaah Blade Runner is such a good movie
<shadowLurker> Hay, Bronies!
<DoctorWhooves> 0I would love to see Nostalgia Critic do this movie...
<Mastertortilla27> Hush now quite no-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

<mib_79npkj> wantwantwant

<DeadlyPon3> Selp tying shoes, must be THE FUTURE
<chedduhr> who always dresses in style?
<SirDerpsalot> Yes.
<Octavia> 13Its Octavia VV :P
<MightyMatrix> how much do they cost?
<SirDerpsalot> Get out.
<Silverscreen> 11THETROLLSIDE!
<Stargazer> pony babies was the worst, they didn't even try remotely in that one lol
<Aponymous123> Yes
<RAWRity> well, I'm gonna go for a bit. I've still got about 450 words for today, but I'll be back in time for the MLP movie
<mallam> idk
<Suncatcher> I need an adult.
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when someone disliked pinkie pie?
<Jace-Arveduin> probably
<PrincessCelestia> say who has the biggest plot?
<Lasharus> I always used /e in WoW. Which doesn't work on IRC, I think.
<nah> @gingerbrony666 are you ibts
<EmmettBrown> All british police officers should look like this. http://layton.neoseeker.com/w/i/layton/1/13/ClampGrosky.png
<Silverscreen> 11WHAT DO YOU WANT?!
<Darf14> SI
<Lemon> *legasp*
<Baron_von_Brony> yes
<Aponymous123> Capitalist Army FTW
<lastone1376> he only does bad movies
<C9317> *is banished to teh moon for speaking out against trollestia*
<mariomarc> in newborn, Double Rainbows create Unicorns
<Nyst> The saxophone is augmented
<BRONY> CUPCAKES
<Thetrollside> WHAT
<Xzite> yea
<Buytoast> Don't hate Pinkie.
<Rohan> Should be 3 hours earlier, Tifa
<shadowLurker> how are you doing this fine day?
<Rated-RPonyStar> I don't think Nostaligia critic will do Blade Runner, it's consitered a good one
<PonehMan> How can you dislike the Glorious Pink One?
<Derolith> Brony is sposed' to like all ponies. Duh.
<Buytoast> Hate Dash.
<Zephirdd> Wasnt Prince of Persia good?
<Quiltone> I watched this movie when it came out. She was ridico-hot
<Celestia> 8:30 central is Season II. Correct for your time zone.
<mib_2g1nmx> pinke is my least fav but i still like her
<mib_9cojqz> nope.
<[ger]Brony1> Celestia has the biggest plot
<DoctorWhooves> 0oh right
<Lemon> Flutterplot
<Thetrollside> I CAN HAS DASH CHANNEL?!
<Cobalt> Tifa: 8pm PST, so in about 3 hours.
<Twalaht> so at 9am tomorrow season 1 episode 1 will stream here?
<gic1898> FiM being the best thing from this decade? imokaywiththis.jpg
<everfreenights> WHERE WAS GONDOR WHEN DISCORD ESCAPED
<mallam> cupcakes ftw
<SirDerpsalot> Doc, this is heavy.
<Zephirdd> I heard lots of people liked it
<fluttercry> We lost people :(
<Destroyer> maybe the pinkie room is exploding from randomness?
<Meanwhile> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<Tovler> True Capitalist go real old real fast. Ghost only has like 40 phrases
<Tifa> Rohan, YAY! :D
<mariomarc> yeah
<Natleyn> I'm an adult :3
<Colin> Pinkie is frigin boss ok?
<Tehpogo> Everyone knows that unicorns belong in Unicornia
<djdexcat> I think RE gave up on being a horror series years ago. Now it's more action-y.
<House> Or, y'know Dash, being able to create bacteria
<PrincessCelestia> waiting to see that in season 2
<Natleyn> Technically.
<Tehpogo> Not in OUR back yard!
<Blinky> Haven't seen that one
<mib_9lq815> Run! Prince Blueblood has been corrupted by the Nightmare! He's calling himself "Sapphire Essence".
<DoctorWhooves> 0I thought he JUST did old ones
<General_Hazard> They're too expensive, if I remember correctly, you're not even supposed to where them
<lastone1376> it was the 80s
<mallam> Can I make you a cupcake? *maniac grin*
<Misha> Never liked MLP in first place until a mate of mine tipped me about FIM. I first thought he'd lost it but i ended up enjoying it and here i am today. The older generations... no
<DashWithRainbows> Ed, Edd n Eddy is one of my most favourite cartoons
<Waifles> It states right in the pilot that Luna Became Jealous of the day and because of that, she was going to create an eternal night. How can she do that? By destroying Celestia, that's why when Nightmare Moon attacked Celestia, Celestia had to do something.
<shadow_light> uh sex?.
<chedduhr> .......what does that say about dash?
<Celestia> Is banished to the moon for becoming possessed and evil.
<Rainbow-Dash> What are you saying Buytoast?
<EmmettBrown> Yes thats his chest hair poking out of his collar
<Diftraku> Oh lol, I remember seeing them in the stores
*Saint_Absol wants to see Octavia and Vinyl Scratch together in Season 2 :p
<PonehMan> Pinkie Pie for Princess!
<MrMaxaminus> nom
<lunamoonie> g3.5...god they were the worst ponies ever. i mean, the toys were ok but the show... *shudders*
<Silverscreen> 11#Rainbow_Dash

<Flameshy> maybe, someone should check
<Shadowx> i can triple task haha , watching movie-kinda, bronystate irc- decent amount, skype-decent
<mib_vhad4c> That's not how you spell Rarity.
<Ziltoid> DAT EAR IBBLE
<mariomarc> what the fuck was with that rasicm
<Quiltone> Friend of mine said Prince of Persia was OK. I dunno.
<MightyMatrix> Mine too
<mib_79npkj> server timed out?
<Like_a_BAWSS> uuhhghghghghgh i need ponys. I'm tired of watching this
<Spazturtle> EmmettBrown CID look like that (the detectives)
<MrMaxaminus> nom
<mib_9lq815> Be sure not to mention that sounds like a porn name or he'll smite you
<Lemon> NO! No one hates RD. maybe G1-3... but not G4!
<PinkamenaDianePie> I concur.
<Zed> Her: Not Sure if Want
<gdpony> 9am in which time zone?
<mib_k0pv3d> COULD SOMEPONY PLEASE TELL ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ROOMS!?!
<cbpony9001> just got off the stream and I made him shoutout cbpony
<Stargazer> the new Thundercat's is pretty good IMO
<Rated-RPonyStar> He does, bad 80's and 90's stuff
<AdamTheChao> Prince of Persia didn't have to be related to the game. So it being good doesn't mean much
<House> Or interplanetary rockets
<Dermathil> 525!
<Tall_Tails> woo is the stream working for anyone?
<Colin> Prince Blueblood was always corrupted!
<crickettwb> Technically?
<everfreenights> emmettbrown HA, professor layton, never thought I would see that here
<gingerbrony666> II didn't say hate, I said dislike. I just think she's overated
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when i forced this meme during the lord of the rings showing and have been keeping it alive every time since?
<Foxpony> I need food
<chedduhr> and twilight doesn't exist there?
<Caboozles> 0You want shipping?
<Zed> RAPE
<Slowter> That awkward moment you kiss a robot your supposed to kill
<C9317> oh and another thing
<techdude300> There are rooms?
<Ziltoid> oh she mad
<Caboozles> 0Why.jpg
<dastrdlyW> Shot down
<RAWRity> Legally I'm an adult, but I certainly don't feel like it.
<lunamoonie> i need ponies too :(
<Thetrollside> I NEED AN INVITE

<House> MLP is the only cartoon I've watched eps multiple times
<Silverscreen> 11FluttershY: they're invite only.
<C9317> derpy has a lot to offer the mane cast
<PonehMan> Luna= suck. Banish me to the moon
<Suncatcher> anyway, I think that the name started as a pun on Aloysius, an archaic but definitely masculine name.
<DJBrony> lack of ponies, be back later
<Tovler> nah: I guess a better example would be if they made Vinyl Scratches eyes Green
<DeadlyPon3> So. Very. LARGE
<General_Hazard> almost reminds me of the chick from true romance
<MightyMatrix> and Party everyday
<Buytoast> Think of all the things they can do with that guy's nose.

<C9317> about discord, isn't he voiced by one the guys of star trek NG?

<mallam> GENERATION 4!!!
<mariomarc> wanna check out Highlander next week, never seen it
<Lasharus> Couldn't get that to work, but I can see the screen fine, luckily.
<Waifles> most people don't understand that all the negativity surrounding Celestia, is fabrication or hyperbole. Of course the Luna fans constantly pump out this contrived stuff in the vain hopes that people will be blinded to Luna's evil actions of the past, and look at Celestia as the real evil. Thankfully there is intelligence in the Brony community that can see
<mib_6vl8h8> Q
<Lemon> Yep, Q.
<DSNesmith> reanimator
<VioletVanilla> 6Be safe Navy_Brony . . . >:

<mib_vhad4c> Yeah Lauren pretty much said she was going to be emo.
<Rohan> NEXUS SIX.
<fluttercry> yeah so this happens every friday?
<Combustiblelemons> elky: a talking head on a plate of blood?
<DragonRage> Lightning? I am THERE!
<Rated-RPonyStar> Oh wow, he's taking this really well
<LunarWarrior> Hello Everybrony.
<KingGummy341> discord was supposed to be a colt
<NorseThunder> The Q stands for Qamazing.
<DoctorWhooves> 0hey now...
<a041744> in my pants?
<Tovler> Q is best letter of the alphabet
<VioletVanilla> 6Every Friday at 7PM EST and Saturday at 2PM EST
<Ponynigma> I just always think Harrison Ford is a badass man
<Elky> hm... sounds familiar
<General_Hazard> you need to have the right mindset for film noir. I fell asleep during Chinatown, and refuse to watch it again
<[ger]Brony1> Do the caramelldansen, robot.
<RandomExtra> Yes.
<Rated-RPonyStar> Conistering they are PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW!
<Celestia> Us Celestia fans are of a higher caliber. [/sarcasm]
<Buytoast> Show him your uplink device.
<Vagrant> error massageeee D:
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> C9317: Yeah I heard that too. It's going to be clop-tastic.
<Ponynigma> He's just so...
<Aponymous> We need to watch a Highlander movie the first one for A, The Source or 2 for B
<Buytoast> Wink wink
<Waifles> that Celestia doesn't deserver the hate at all. They know the difference between Canon and Fanon, and they know the facts that Luna did try to kill everything.
*DragonRage packs his bags for Virginia Beach. It's only the entire country away!
<DSNesmith> the music just got reaaaaally creepy
<Dermathil> Q.....
<everfreenights> NECKSNAP
<Drakengarde> ...I want Microsoft Sam back on my PC. Microsoft Anna sucks.
<mariomarc> i agree
<Nittany_Tiger> Q and Z rule.
<PonehMan> these damn blind bag ponies are stupid hard to get out of the packaging
<Triximancer> Twilight Sparkle room is best room
<Suncatcher> I think that it might be mispronounced in the episode, but as long as it's consistent you can't really call a name mispronounced.
<Elky> still, maybe it was too late
<Apokalipse> I liked Evil dead III
<PinkamenaDianePie> Why these androids have grammar bad?
<DoctorWhooves> 0I THINK...THEREFOR I AM
<Silverscreen> 11...
<DragonRage> But seriously, hope you're okay.
<fluttercry> sweet
<DeadlyPon3> Watching Black Dynamite
<NorseThunder> Avenue Q.

<Quiltone> Every time I hear her name I think of Bubblegum Crisis
<Meanwhile> She be all lanky.
<DSNesmith> this music just got reeeeally creepy
<C9317> *clops to season 2*
<Tehpogo> Pris looks like she just walked out of a Tim Burton film
<Ponynigma> Manly, or grizzly
<Xzite> ha! i still got sam
<Flameshy> sweet something to do every week
<Lasharus> Drakengarde: Bwuh?

<DSNesmith> hey valtheJean, pegacorn's online
<LGNR> Deus Ex cyborgs >>>>>>>>>>>>>> Blade Runner cyborgs.
<Rohan> bublbublbbublbl
<Silverscreen> 11How can you NOT think of Harley Quinn when looking at her?
<MuNova> Waifles: I think the Trollestia thing is funny, but I agree
<General_Hazard> DY-NA-MITE. DY-NA-MITE.
<Shadowx> OCTAVIA the ustream is up :D
<Dumori> is much more B than 2
<Shadowx> testing it now
<mib_4hcqjl> how long until it starts?
<Lemon> X, Z, Q
<Tovler> Discord was supposed to sing Toxic Love. My personal fanon is still possible.
<Lasharus> Stop that Silverscreen!
<Navy_Brony> Yeah I just hear lots of thunder out there.
<Slowter> Bubbles
<DSNesmith> evil dead 3 was great, yeah
<C9317> Move over gears of war 3!
<Elky> sklar: replace it with a chainsaw
<mib_6vl8h8> UncannyValley
<Lasharus> I can already not unsee that. :P
<mariomarc> tehpogo, yes so much
<Wrek> 05decrapitude
<BakedMacintosh> DeadlyPon3 that movie...
*Saint_Absol lives in Ohio; almost literally in the middle of nowhere
<MightyMatrix> Chinatown has more action though
<C9317> ponies is way more manly
<Octavia> 13Okay, thtas good. DCD got it fixed.

<everfreenights> excellerated decrepitude dude
<mattwhite924> Pris always creaped me out.
<DoctorWhooves> 0Speaking of which, is anypony gonna get "Chainsaw Lolipop"?
<kirzstryfe> lol
<Metostopholes> Accelerated decrepitude!
<DSNesmith> the slapstick got a bit overdone at times but... it's evil dead 3!
<djdexcat> Well, you've made that impossible now, Silverscreen
<sklar> Oh got it now
<Slowter> Ponies are unstoppable
<Caboozles> 0FFFREEEZE
<mib_vhad4c> I thought we weren't spoiling.
<RandomExtra> However, usually only 2 pony episodes are shown per show. Obviously, this is a special event, so we're doing a marathon!
<VioletVanilla> 6Please do come back Flameshy! c; We love new regulars!
<PrincessCelestia> gotta move that gesr up
<MightyMatrix> wait
<NorseThunder> Things will die.

<cbpony9001> WELL YOU GONNA GO BANANAS ON THE OFFFFFFFFFWOOORRRRLD BEEEYTCH
*Octavia 13lives in OH too
<Waifles> Trollestia thing is quite funny, IMO. Though it's meant to be more humorous than serious.
<mib_4hcqjl> alright cool 40 minutes
<Combustiblelemons> deathstalker 2 was hilarious
<GabeMoist> http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/116/f/9/my_little_reanimator_by_don_komandorr-d3ey1hy.jpg

<Apokalipse> It had a magical boomstick
<DeadlyPon3> what is it?
<Buytoast> That guy's face looks like an orange.
<mib_4hcqjl> You guys ready for SEASON 2?
<General_Hazard> Dude okay so the guy playing Black Dynamite is also Jax in the new Mortal Kombat Legacy series
<Celestia> I cancelled my preorder of Gears III and Dead Island and bought Pony Plushies instead.

<a041744> Smart people play chess

<MuNova> So there's another hour... hm
<AllisZero> FUCKITY FUUUUUUUUUUU
<Fluttershy`> Scootaloo: I'm at mountain time. s2 will be shown 7am mst
<Tehpogo> Fluttershy doens't like being overcrowded like this. She freaks out easily
<Lemon> Not for me...
<Waifles> @MuNova Yeah it more than likely would. Though until I hear differently, all I have is Canon to go off of. Then again, I would like to see the Luna story more fleshed out, we know so very little about that time.
<Scootaloo> i dont mind that at all
<AllisZero> IFORGOT TO ADD TO MY ORDER
<crickettwb> At least that's what I thought at first.
<Dermathil> DragonRage: TaraStrong is using /me
<CloverCloud> 5:22 here as well.
<djdexcat> My old film class said that the glasses on this guy are symbollic.
<Bjornfot> </3
<DSNesmith> but yeah, birdemic
<Drakengarde> The text-to-speech program on Moonbase Alpha sounds exactly like--assuming it isn't--Microsoft Sam
<Shadowx> the 5 mins lol
<Diftraku> Oh hello! I just remembered I have caffeine pills
<DSNesmith> the coat hanger scene
<Hat> lol doctor in bladerunner

<Puppy> "ah-loo-ish-iss" that's the name I thought it was based from
<Scootaloo> will it be streamed in this room?
<DragonRage> Ah, that makes sense.
<Dumori> hehehehehe
<AllisZero> THERE GOES $30 DOWN THE DRAIN
<Digitalforehead> too bad
<djdexcat> In keeping with the film's "Eyeball Motif"
<Flameshy> that would be awesome
<Rohan> DO A BARREL ROLL
<RandomExtra> ...Ouch.
<chedduhr> nah, she just doesn't like being the center of attention
<Lasharus> It's a specific language available only to ominous characters.
<everfreenights> CYBER CHESS
<DSNesmith> and the editing
<CloverCloud> Can a girl be a brony?
<Wrek> 05everyone hug Diftraku, or face the might of the trout!
<Troggle> what are they a symbol of?
<Natleyn> NorseThunder: No colors :(
<DashWithRainbows> which is a dove?
<DSNesmith> the editor was the worst actor in the film
<Daniel> 8:22 here
<Darf14> now its 6:22
<Aponymous> I saw the coat hanger scene from Birdemic, I REALLY want to see the whole thing.
<mib_6vl8h8> Yes
<DoctorWhooves> 0and I was like, "whats goin in"
<mib_6vl8h8> No
<NorseThunder> 0Girls are bronettes.
<gic1898> Archimedes, no! It's filthy in there.
<Lemon> Hm... does anypony, when Season 1 starts, want to do a singalong for each song?
<Celestia> So who's staying up until Season II Ep I?
<mib_6vl8h8> Maybe
*Natleyn hugs Diftraku
<Fluttershy`> CloverCloud: yes. I'm a girl. I'm a brony. XP
<mallam> checkmate!
<Drakengarde> If only for the fact Anna can't do the roflcopter correctly
<mib_6vl8h8> Indeed
<mib_vhad4c> I have an epipen and six 4lokos
<NorseThunder> 0Or pegasisters.
<shadowLurker> CloverCloud, yes
<Moop205> yo!

<Waifles> I do not fear trout, Bacon is where the true power is at
<rainbowdashie> what the hell are they even doing
<RayneJCyro> Me
<Combustiblelemons> so... how did we get 527 bronies tonight but during the stress test we only got 200
<AllisZero> Awww baaaaaallls
<crickettwb> Hallo
<Grundle> I feel sorry for Pizza Hut employees everywhere
<Scootaloo> MLP Season 2, will it be streamed in this room? =O
<Choco> I am
<DashWithRainbows> god i loved that video
<Slowter> Anyone can be a Brony (technically)
<MakerDusk> of course a girl can be a brony
<Saboba> ohai boss, it's 1 in the morning, have a chess move
<DragonRage> Female Bronies are still Bronies.
<Celestia> @CloverCloud They're called pegasisters.
<Lemon> (Friend next to me recommended)
<Grundle> Pony requests and whatnot
<DoctorWhooves> 0ya rly
<DSNesmith> birds making stuka dive bombing sounds and exploding
<fluttercry> cancel then order another
*Diftraku feels the love
<Xzite> it ist sam
<scorchman> I thought girl bronies were pegasisters?
<AllisZero> I'm seriously bummed right now
<Mastertortilla27> I'm staying up!
<Elky> now you're making me curious about birdemic
<RandomExtra> ...You know, it'd be hilarious if they drew G3.5 RD on it just to be trolls.
<DashWithRainbows> IMO best one
<Moop205> so much sugar!
<MuNova> Waifles: Yes again, lol. We need more Luna in general, and the whole NMM thing more eloration
<[ger]Brony1> Or sissies
<DragonRage> It's a gender neutral term.
<Dumori> not seen any of the Birdemic
<LupalFillyus> The traffic lights are all off @me
<mib_vhad4c> no they are NOT called pegasister
<Xzite> he cant do the erbrbrbrbr
<SilkAMV> The modern name is Alouiscius
<StarmoonShroud> YAY Milk and Cookies!
<mib_1icz5o> Is the season 1 pony marathon still happening?
<Tovler> Salmon >>>>> Trout
<GabeMoist> No one cars about stress tests
<MrPoniator_> Scootaloo, yes
<a041744> Everyone is a brony, they just dont know it yet
<mib_vhad4c> that is a dirty rumor
<Xzite> just tested :D
<CloverCloud> Heh. Twas curious. My bro said I wasnt a brony is all.
<LGNR> "Checkmate, I think"
<djdexcat> He 'cannot see' the problems the replicants have with thier short lifespans
<General_Hazard> Archimedes is Merlin's pet owl >_>
<RandomExtra> Still though, there's always next time.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 eeyup
<NorseThunder> 0Eh, bronette sounds cooler to me.
<Wrek> 05not enough hugs given, sigh...
<Happy-Kah> there is metal music?
<DSNesmith> birdemic is hilarious
<Catface> 0female Could be called pegasisters.
<Happy-Kah> what?
<Moop205> i agree with gender neutarl
<LGNR> Not suspicious at all
<Scootaloo> Thanks poniator
<Slowter> Dat Owl
<Celestia> Nah, they're pegasisters.
<gic1898> Yeah, shame it came with the worst update.
<DragonRage> That said, if somebody doesn't want to be called brony, just call 'em what they want.
<Rohan> I do believe brony is gender neutral and applies to people over the general age target.
<mib_6vl8h8> LAZER OWL
<DSNesmith> it's a love story
<trebthegamer> spidercar!
<LupalFillyus> Screw them, this room is best room

<Shadowx> nah
*RobotPinkie hugs Wrek instead
<Flutterspy> I need a hug :3

<AllisZero> Damn man
<Hat> Owlowliscious
<DSNesmith> minus the chemistry
<Zephirdd> owlowliscious
<Rohan> OWL"
<Meanwhile> Owlowicious
<Darf14> Screw gender politics, if you like G4 then you are a Brony
<Tovler> YA RLY
<Rated-RPonyStar> The eye of evil!
<fluttercry> brony is unisex
<Octavia> 13Ick, I dislike the "pegasisters" term.
<RAWRity> hey look, it's owlowicsious
<mib_83ekt1> o rly
<MuNova> Pegasis works, bronette works,
<Combustiblelemons> I haven't seen birdemic
<Metostopholes> Yeah, nothing ws lighting up for me
<Grundle> You get pizza, so it's all good
<crickettwb> Whoah, there was an owl.
<SlurryMoon> Bright eyes owl
<DSNesmith> plus killer bird bombs
<Rohan> O RLY
<Shelltoon> Pegasister is an attempt to once again create gender specific terms.
<SuperBrony64> Female Bronies are Pegasis, but
<nah> @celestia why are you telling me this
<SuperBrony64> B
<mib_vhad4c> welcome to the herd.
<Shinitai> Who
<DoctorWhooves> 0lololololol
<Rohan> NO WEI
<Octavia> 13I just call everyone "Brony"

<LupalFillyus> I'm already way happy i finally got the stream to work
<DSNesmith> imagine The Birds
<Rohan> ^
<MuNova> I prefer pegasis, but I also consider myself a brony
<SuperBrony64> Bronies is now a universal term for both girls and boys
<mariomarc> owlicious
<DSNesmith> but with no script
<prince-dari> Probably beucase my internet is derping.
<Tehpogo> Firefox is kind of weird about the traffic lights
<Combustiblelemons> sounds like a good b movie to me
<StarmoonShroud> Bronies is gender neutral
<Xzite> who?
<DSNesmith> less budget
<AllisZero> I didn't want pizza
<mib_vhad4c> Dat owl
<mib_85uqu3> Hello everypony. Sorry to interrupt during Blade Runner. But I need some info about the S2 premiere. I don't know what time it will be.
<Octavia> 13lol Hai :P
<DSNesmith> and even less sense
<Fluttershy`> I'm a brony and I'm a girl
<NorseThunder> 0Of course not.
<Celestia> I suppose brony is fair enough.
<prince-dari> Just leave it up and they should light up.
<mib_2fkn0c> Isn't it 17th?
<ampson> that owl
<StarmoonShroud> It comes from 4 chan
<Destroyer> I actually ordered Pizza Hut pizza today... sadly I didn't think of asking them to draw somepony
<Dumori> YAY!
<Slowter> Assimilate into the hoard
<NorseThunder> 0It comes out tomorrow.

<RayneJCyro> How do I get in the dash room? I keep clicking the button but it doesn't do anything
<Dermathil> Combustiblelemons: this is the real thing
<DashWithRainbows> >does not care for Merlin
<RAWRity> this movie is READING OUR MINDS
<WarlordRaw> How the fuck are we gonna know when the streans on...
<House> I dislike the term Brony, no troll
<LGNR> After the B-movie.
<Flameshy> I don't have any money for pizza
<Dumori> yeah
<Elky> sounds good to me
<DashWithRainbows> :l
<AllisZero> Damn it
<SilkAMV> 9:00 EDT
<Zephirdd> who
<Moondancer> who?
<djdexcat> Uh... Guy With Glasses there. Can't think of his name
<KanyeEast> are you implying girls can't be bro?
<Shelltoon> Brony is derived from the "bro culture"
<Dermathil> yes, Sklar
<Tovler> Looks more like Pigwedgeon
<Lemon> D:
<Quiltone> Terrel
<DSNesmith> never played it
<prince-dari> Firefox. >_>
<nah> @catface brony.
<Spazturtle> Octavia Brony comes from /b/ and /r/ and pony mixed
<General_Hazard> Merlin's cool... :C
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the S2 premiere is 9AM EST
<Drakengarde> That poor little field mouse...IT MUST HAVE BEEN OWLOWLISCIOUS!
<crickettwb> In the morning?
<Moondancer> who?
<Slowter> Anyone getting a vampire feel?
<NorseThunder> 0There's a bronette in my class.
<mib_vhad4c> It's derived from "pony"
<House> Why can't we just be ponyfans
<Aponymous> Birdemic showed me that you CAN use a PSX to render special effects for a movie.
<SilentEcho> Hi Hi!
<PeanutButterDimond> Girls are bronies.
<mib_6vl8h8> Dr. Mace Tyrell
<DSNesmith> I don't have the time to get sucked into another game like that 0.o

<Silverscreen> 11Djdexcat: Nostalgia Critic
<Rainbow> #dash
<Rohan> Eh I'm just gonna start calling everyone Equestrians.
<Elky> never bothered, seems too expensive
<Dumori> fyi "Not Long Till Pony" is an amazeing seed
<WarlordRaw> How the fuck are we gonna know when the streans on...
<Combustiblelemons> perhaps everyones getting a place on the server for tomorrows livestream :P
<DSNesmith> I thought they just used photoshop

<everfreenights> MOAR LIFE

<MuNova> Fluttershy`: Same here. I just prefer to be called pegasis if I'm being pointed out as a female fan
<DoctorWhooves> 0OF COURSE
<mib_85uqu3> Thank you SilkAMV. It's just I live in Britain and was having a bit of trouble finding out, as we don't get the Hub here.
<Darf14> dang, the story lost me
<NorseThunder> 0It comes on Sunday at 8 AM.
<LupalFillyus> in chrome it showed nothing but the adds, not even chat
<Lemon> Dat spacesuit.
<Luna_peek> you can see the status of all rooms at http://www.bronystate.net/theatre
<Zephirdd> Silverscreen, where's the random trivia
<RAWRity> also, I'd suggest doing a /nick name change anon. It's hard to type out all that to address you
<Xzite> Drakengarde yea, it looks totally real
<Catface> 0Cutiemark Crusaders Chatting!!! Yay!
<SilentEcho> That's 11pm here D:
<Zephirdd> like on the batman mov
<Luna_peek> just look at the traffic lights ;)
<PeanutButterDimond> I presonally don't see a need to seperate the genders for t with me.
<Zephirdd> D:
<MightyMatrix> I think he said fucker
<mib_85uqu3> So it's 2pm for me!
<mib_vhad4c> technically this film does feature a unicorn pony
<Zephirdd> lolololo~
<SilentEcho> I hope I'll be able to watch it.
<GMarshal[TL]> Only 21 rarity fans? :-/
<Tehpogo> In the Final Cut edition, he says "Father" instead of "fucker"
<Dermathil> Dumori: it is good in 1.8?
<DSNesmith> what was that hitchcock movie with the guys afloat at sea?
<fnenfejsfnjksnfjes> Yay
<FreezeFrame> Yup, first time I saw the term, it was spelled /b/ronies
<Fluttershy`> MuNova I like being a tombrony XP
<BakedMacintosh> I heard Fucker
<Luna_peek> and Lupal
<Drakengarde> xD
<Tehpogo> Make of that what you will.
<Luna_peek> get ABP
<Slowter> @NorseThunder try a catchy song
<Dumori> it's a 1.8 seed
<JustAnotherDerp> What is this movie? It's awesome.
<GabeMoist> I bet none of use will win the lottery
<LupalFillyus> aww poor AJ and rarity
<Rohan> Myaaaah.
<AllisZero> I can't say that on the phone...
<prince-dari> Pinkie, Rarity, and AJ are open.
<Dumori> I made it today
<Flameshy> why not draw Fluttershy on the ramen box :3
<Dermathil> awesome
<Luna_peek> it's amazing
<Silverscreen> 11Zephirdd: Had too much to prepare for with BronyState to worry about the trivia.
<MuNova> Fluttershy`: but if it's like "Mu is an MLP fan", MLP fan is interchangeable with brony
<DSNesmith> yeah, probably not
<House> Brony just reminds me too much of the... more obsessive fans of the show
<Rohan> Blade Runner
<GabeMoist> it will be won my anonymous guys
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Lots of science up in this shit.
<StarmoonShroud> tombrony or tomcolt.
<FreezeFrame> With the slashes, to show it was from /b/
<DSNesmith> when is the lottery?
<Elky> sadly gabe
<nah> @justanotherderp bladerunner
<SilkAMV> When I got here there were only 14
<Applebloom> CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS BLADE RUNNERS, YAY
<Zephirdd> who watched Batman the dark knight here?
<C9317> so when do y'all think the CM crusaders will get their cutie marks?
<RAWRity> gmarshal[tl] yes, it's quite deplorable
<SilentEcho> Also, are we watching movies right now?
<Drakengarde> Of course, I can't think of that scene without that one line from this one YTP I seen.
<djdexcat> Oh, and in some versions, he says "I want more life (Father/Fucker)." Like, both words at once.
<Metostopholes> The lights don't light up for me in FF or IE. Whatever, Pinkie is best
<mib_85uqu3> Ah, nickchange... how do I do it?
<DoctorWhooves> 0ME
<GabeMoist> none of which will be present

<Elky> the movies picked will have to be something special
<SuperBrony64> Did he mention about having Telomerase?
<PonehMan> NEVAAA
<NorseThunder> 0I use bronette/pegasister because it's easier to say than female brony.
<Fluttershy`> MuNova: I think of myself as a 'tombrony' but I don't mind being called 'brony'
<Grundle> Dunno
<VioletVanilla> 6Need a pony to draw on ramen box? Why not Zoidburg?
<LGNR> "/nick *nick*"

<NewDCD> 9no hard feelings
<fluttercry> completely random but my black ops emblem is fluttershy's cutie mark. and my friend has rainbow dash's
<LupalFillyus> yeah, it's the whole "allow fuck everything to get the shitting stream working" that allowed ads
<DSNesmith> is that an A or a B, anyway
<Zephirdd> lol xD
<CopperCogs> awesome quote
<Happy-Kah> it is cool
<Rohan> C9317 Season 14272
<PrincessCelestia> season 3 villain will be tim curry.
<Grundle> Rainbow Dash just to be a troll, would require the highest number of crayons
<Lemon> I am to.
<NorseThunder> 0Season 2 starts at 9 AM eastern.

<GabeMoist> I want a large Pinkie is watching you OREVER poster
<LuckyLeaf> Too little blades and running
<Metostopholes> I refuse. :P
<LupalFillyus> how much cussing is allowed in /pinkie?
<Aponymous> I NEED to win the lottery again. I will murder all the newfoals to win if I have to.
<General_Hazard> Trick question! He purposefully pronounced it so that it would sound like both. This was done to avoid unnecessary editing when they wanted to show the movie on TV later on
<SuperBrony64> inb4 pain…
<Stonegaze> So that if one of you could give me a precition how long this movies takes because I don't wish to spoil it.
<FallenAngel> gmt will be 1400

<Scootaloo> ehh, what movie is this?
<everfreenights> AND THEN DIE LIKE THE REST OF US
<nah> @pinkamenadianepie okay looky here
<Buytoast> Think of all the things the CMC can try between the three of them...
<House> I've seen Blade Runner about four times
<Slowter> @PinkamenaDianePie that has been asked before, but we're still not sure
<RAWRity> when I got here there were only 8, and one of those was the channel server
<ThatOnePony> <PinkamenaDianePie Yes
<sklar> Yeah Elky me neather but my friend does he actually a administrator on a pony server they spawned like 100 ghast once i arena he built i guess lag was terrible
<Diftraku> I will be dissappoint if Season 3 doesn't feature Tim the Enchanter
<SuperBrony64> I hate this scene...
<lunamoonie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBHEb4UWpIc&NR=1

<Cobalt> Hey there, I'm having a bit of trouble reopening the stream through the main site. Going to http://bronystate.net/ then clicking Theatre brings me to the pony room selection, but clicking on a pony does nothing.

<cbpony9001> the chat is at ludicrous speed
<Vergil> Did he died?
<Happy-Kah> hmmm, i think it is trying to say he is just insane
<Lightning_Flicker> He is now Bat Man.
<DSNesmith> Memento made me go nuts
<DashOrCrash> Well, I was horrified the first time I saw it
<Darf14> He has met a terrible faith hasn't he
<Flutteryay> I have a funny word
<Lemon> brb
<trebthegamer> but it sounded creepy
<djdexcat> Silverscreen is a Troper? Not surprising.
<desertman2> that's you
<StarmoonShroud> eeyup

<StarPlatinum> He shouldn't have done that.
<House> MIDGETS, EVERYWHERE

<RAWRity> owlowiscious Y YOUR NAME SO HARD TO SPELL?
<nah> @c9317 if you know what i'm sayin.
<Darf14> Flying cars, we will have them eventually
<LGNR> My Little Midgets <3
<NorseThunder> 0Han shot first.
<Navy_Brony> *Smack*
<Dumori> it's such a good part of the moive and it makes nearly every one uncomfertable
<GabeMoist> hmm
<Aponymous123> Her special talent should be a pencil.
<Slowter> Around 12 Hrs till season 2 @MrSirPGW
<DashOrCrash> There won't be an outrage here
<Quinn197> Blade Runner
<Shadowx> who needs movie theater? we've got front row seats and great friends to discuss it with
*Grundle 's curiosity is piqued
<Rated-RPonyStar> 0You win this round...but i shall strike back!
<desertman2> I see running in this movie, but I don't see any blades
<MuNova> MrSirPGW: About 11.5 hours, good sir
<Meanwhile> I'll tell whoever your parents are on you.
<Hat> JustaBrony: Bladerunner
<chedduhr> I dunno
<House> Blade Runner
<Misha> Treasure Planet
<Aponymous> I remember nah
<Elky> apok: and such a little chance to win
<Sir_Hoofalot> Do animated movies count?
<DSNesmith> that's because they did the "used future, business wear" thing
<Metostopholes> Probably too niche for a big budget one
<DSNesmith> Aliens did it too
<DoctorWhooves> 0Y HALO THAR HARLEY
<NorseThunder> 0Flying cars are implausible.
<LupalFillyus> n1
<GabeMoist> Nah?...........nah
<MrSirPGW> Thank you
<PinkamenaDianePie> Star Wars Episode 9001.
<Mr_Santana> 12 hours and 30 seconds for pst
<Rohan> And now they shoot at the same time.
<Apokalipse> yeah
<DSNesmith> that's why it doesn't look dated
<Owlowiscious> RAWRity: All the better to get people to spell it correctly!
<NightmareNyx> we already have flying cars, they're called airplanes
<Happy-Kah> we don't have popcorn but i hate that stuff
<DashOrCrash> these people will love and tolerate the S*** out of you
<JustaBrony> @hat THanks
<LupalFillyus> I forgot about that one
<TwilightSparkle> Yep
<Clonehunter> Hello
<Tehpogo> Treasure Planet was SOME kind of ___punk but never did quite nail it
<NorseThunder> 0Imagine traffic in 3D.
<Slowter> Bo
<Clonehunter> Im back
<Fluttershy`> MrSirPGW: 12 hours 30 min
<House> Or helicopters
<Happy-Kah> so yeah, this is better!
<Slowter> Np
<ArcticVanguard> Mr_Santana: seconds?
<Elky> I think I won a movie back in the first non-GET lottery
<DSNesmith> mmmm.... nah
<Shadowx> lol i only have it if its fresh made
<mariomarc> never saw it
<Lasharus> What a nice, totally-not-oppressive environment.
<Flameshy> nice DashOrCrash
<VicViper> does this movie ever get any better
<mattwhite924> In the bluRay Han calls the police who then get there and shoot for him
<PrincessCelestia> china music?
*Octavia 13isnt a fan of popcorn either :)
<Navy_Brony> Movie theater would probably make this movie 3d, and therefore, rape my brain and eyes.
<DSNesmith> I'm still curious
<VicViper> it's pretty boring
<mariomarc> how was it?
<SuperBrony64> Coca Cola!
<Elky> with something like 32 people
<Silverscreen> 11@NorseThunder: Actually, Han shot alone. Guido didn't even shoot in the originally released Star Wars.
<PonehMan> sounds like chinses sweetie derelle
<herospirit> So I'm very, very late :p
<SilkAMV> They didn't have the technology to make it cheesy
<LupalFillyus> It was fun and bright, that was enough.
<Shadowx> not theater stuff though

<DSNesmith> and got denied
<Troggle> As any realtor will tell you
<Tehpogo> It's okay actually.
<Buytoast> That's no regular blimp.
<Diftraku> Han shot first!
<Zephirdd> heh
<herospirit> Kettlecorn > Popcorn
<Dark_Horst> people are working on it
<Darf14> I wonder if that blimp will play a vital roll in the story
<TwilightSparkle> ...
<DashOrCrash> I just adapted the line to the situation
<Lasharus> In the slightest Rated-rponystar
<DSNesmith> and the mods are still keeping mum about it
<Troggle> location, location, location
<Shadowx> dont matter hero you didnt miss the S1 marethon!
<Buytoast> That there is a future blimp.
<GabeMoist> lol
<Dark_Horst> it will come

<Quiltone> I'm just sayin, Priss needs to knuckle-bomb him
<fluttercry> in the blue ray for star wars, alderaan shoots at the death star
<LGNR> They did have the technology to make it look old, though.
<GabeMoist> I remember that
<Zephirdd> stereotypes were being defined at that time

<Tehpogo> I've never been a fan of Disney Romance Subplots, and Hunchback's is pretty lousy as well. It EASILY has my favourite villain though.

<Rainbow_derp> oh I was at an anime Convention, at a late night pannel, that ended up being an off the cuff pannel, as the original host did not show up. So they took a random staffer and said do stuff on hentai

<BronyumHex> the film ends in about 20 mins if i remember
<Baron_von_Brony> guys stop looking at my plot its embarassing
<StarPlatinum> ROY used RAGE!

<DesertRose> The Water is ALIVE!
<LupalFillyus> but his motives were scarce beyond "burn the witch, kill the onstorosity"
<StarmoonShroud> I'm just saying... We're getting all ramped up for episode one but there is SO much to go through. Wasn't it confirmed a few months ago too that season 2 is 24 episodes? This is going to be such a long year....

<JustaBrony> @violetvanilla isnt it at 9:00 pm EST?
<Silverscreen> 11So who here is from ponychan and what board thereof?
<a041744> Denied
<RAWRity> One thin I really admire about Inception is that, while there ARE points where they had to use CG, many of the film's most memorable shots are straight up practical effects and camera work, with touches of CG to polish it.
<Norse> PAWNCH
<Aponymous123> I just jumped
<mib_2z88ke> When's the streaming tomorrow for season 2 of MLP?
<Elky> I did see the discord design, but nothing else

<Zephirdd> oh
<Travis_Ball> www.meatspin.com has free MLP videos
<gic1898> I'm a gun nut who likes noir. I'd have to know.

<PonehMan> hey stop that
<Zephirdd> nah, I avoid 'chan
<Marelin> let this be a lesson

<Marelin> carry TWO GUNS
<Happy-Kah> lolololol
<General_Hazard> And then I cringed at the fingers

<Darf14> He should have chopped off his hand instead
<Flutteryay> I'm a /chat/er
<Slowter> He;s pretty good as staying silent
<ArcticVanguard> I can be found on Ponychan
<Tehpogo> This little piggy went to market
<Combustiblelemons> I haven't seen the spoilers
<House> I'm from /co/, 4chan
<pmv_is_best_mv> me too
<Clonehunter> I use ?pony? and ?pic?
<Ponynigma> That gun is so sick man
<Grundle> They should just make the first game free forever, it's great promotional bait for the sequel
<ArcticVanguard> Though I got the link from TeamLiquid
<Metostopholes> Leon was a dick, so he doesn't get a finger
<MuNova> Woah, wtf was with his hand o_O
<DSNesmith> get away from the wall, ford
<Norse> I can be found behind your window.
<DashOrCrash> I swear, I've memorized ~90% of the lines from Portal 2

<GabeMoist> I already saw season 3
<Shelltoon> lol wut? I"m going to give you a few seconds before I come?"
<chedduhr> ouchies
<fluttercry> he broke his fingers
<LGNR> Also, tons of CGI doesn't necessarily equal bad visuals.
<MuNova> Clonehunter: Me too, brony! Hi. lol
<Silverscreen> 11 /co/?!
<mib_2z88ke> Thanks Rohan... one more thing... is there a viewer limit?
<Norse> Shoot through the wall, dumkopf.

<sklar> MuNova oh really.
<LupalFillyus> princess and the frog was awesome
<coopm0re> 0i used to be a bro who hated bronies
<Meanwhile> Well MuNova, i don't have squishy stuff but i do have a moustache.
<Nyst> broken fingers
<Stargazer> so... I'm curious as I've came in late...
<a041744> I don't want to see him com D:
<Shadowx> this is my experience with amnesia
<Dumori> I don;t recall seeign Gaff at all
<DashOrCrash> and I know all the voice actors
<Darken_Skye> sequels been announce but we probably wont get any more information till after Ridley Scott finishes prometheus (the aliens prequel)
*Saint_Absol feels bad.
<kirzstryfe> haven't been around long, but ponychan seems a whole lot better than other chans
<GabeMoist> Using my time machine
<Like_a_BAWSS> whats gonna happen after thids
<EmmettBrown> I've been on it once or twice House
<DSNesmith> you'll make me explode in excitement
<Tehpogo> Agreed.
<mariomarc> thank you
<coopm0re> 0then i thought, oh what the hell
<crickettwb> I like the CG they used in the 80s, because quite often it makes me laugh.
<LGNR> Pirates of the Carribean looks great IMO.
<JustaBrony> rapeing doll..
<coopm0re> 0and watched it
<Owlowiscious> ^Tron Legacy?
<JustaBrony> yes!

<arachnidsGrip> Now I'm really confused.
<ArcticVanguard> I'm from /pic/ mostly, though ironically, I don't create visual mediums
<ThatOnePony> Is the player not working for other people, or is it just me?
<everfreenights> AND THEN THE MOVIE WAS OVER
<Clonehunter> MuNova: How's it going?
<Stargazer> what's so bad about these characters?
<Buytoast> He's going to come alright.
<PinkamenaDianePie> Am I watchig pr0n?
<MuNova> Shelltoon: Yep, it's a ninja-porny
<DesertRose> O_o
<Buytoast> ZING
<BronyumHex> this film is a real mindphuck
<DSNesmith> /b/ counts to 10
<LupalFillyus> i remember it being "the first movie with a non-white damsel" in the paper
<Xzite> yea mostly because of the pony in it :D
<LGNR> And that movie is full of CGI.
<General_Hazard> If that happened to my precious left hand, I would cry
<JustaBrony> YUMMY
<Elky> again with the corpse making out
<PonehMan> Hey have any of you guys seen that new my little pony show?
<Crazyjay> he needs a few seconds with the body before he comes.....
<RAWRity> that's also true. IMO Rise of The Planet of the Apes did a good job.
<JustaBrony> HMMM
<ampson> Hmm.. it would seem that the robots have learned to love.

<Elky> ROCKY
<General_Hazard> This movie's based off the novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" which, by the title, should give you some insight into what's going on in the plot
<DashOrCrash> She lied.
<Shelltoon> This is not Blade Runner. This is clearly Snatcher.
<Norse> Clop, you mean.
<Ponybot> terran up the night!
*TaraStrong : Probably because you are using Firefox
<Navy_Brony> Blade Runner is what the cops who hunt the replicants are called.
<[ger]Brony1> Because there are not pegasi in the future.
<MuNova> Meanwhile: My body is not ready for moustache
<JustaBrony> can someone tell me if it was 9:00 EST or what ever voliet said?
<Slowter> Apparently White robo-dude is dying

<Nyst> Well he's both a superhuman and dying. So he doesn't really care for pain or injuries anymore.
<Scootaloo> when i go to bronystate.net, and try and go to the theater, clicking the different rooms does nothing for me. =(
<Crazyjay> its actually not a bad film
<Slowter> There's a scafolding at the top of the building
<SirDerpsalot> Your mom's irrational.
<Zephirdd> it'd be 1:4 on the other world(thats what I suppose)
<Quiltone> he dropped it a while back

<Fluttershy`> Octavia and Luna HUG
<Scootaloo> what can I do?

<Blinky> He lost it
<Dumori> he's about to die because his makes made him die 4 years after creation
<crickettwb> Oh, unicycle, whoops.
<DSNesmith> still, seems like the movie's undermining its own point
<Rookeealding> getting the hell away from you
<Happy-Kah> he isn't sacry enough

<MrMaxaminus> I can't imagine climbing that with two broken fingers

<a041744> spiderman, spiderman, anything a spider can
<crickettwb> What about pinkie riding a unicorn riding a unicycle?
<Xzite> you dont need a gun when youre awesome
<RAWRity> crickettwb considering the subject matter, that's a bad mistake to make
<DSNesmith> how much time left in this? I may go get dinner
<Nittany_Tiger> That is pretty far up.
<CCCPKiller> I'm hungry.
<Shadowx> woot house to my self for a few hours

<Dumori> just about to end
<Ponynigma> Man, straight up goosebumps from this part till the end
<ampson> I think he blew a fuse.
<fluttercry> might I remind you he's doing this with broken fingers
<arachnidsGrip> Such a 8adass.
<PinkamenaDianePie> Wait, wasn't Ford's fingers broken a few minutes ago?
<Buytoast> Wait, how is he climbing with broken fingers?
<DSNesmith> darn
<Darf14> He just wants to be like spiderman
<Combustiblelemons> so kind of like MGS
<Meanwhile> MuNova, i wasn't aware we were having 'that' kind of convo.
<mallam> 0wow such a ninja
<Cupcakes> WHAT'S IN THE BAG
<Tehpogo> There has GOT to be a more practical way for him to get around
<Flutteryay> there's considerably more stallions is Canterlot. It's just Ponyville that has a 4:1 female-to-male ratio
<DSNesmith> I need to see MLP
<Zephirdd> I remember someone making an statistic out of MLP and he concluded
<Fluttershy`> Luna and Octavia we beat the limit at least but tis so many bronies hehe
<trebthegamer> i know
<Elky> really? this movie went by fast
<RAWRity> crickettwb I'm pretty sure that's a position in the Kama Sutra
<Rainbow_derp> he's gone all kertz on him
<DSNesmith> so I guess I'll skip the pilot of g4
<Nomikos> Scootaloo: i had the same problem, you can just go directly to bronystate.net/theatre/dash/
<fluttercry> he broke them back
<LupalFillyus|AFK> Man, straight up <body part> from this part till end
<Quiltone> Yes but Harrison Ford can climb a building supporting all his weight on two broken fingers.
<Norse> Didn't he have his fingers broken?
<DSNesmith> I've seen it a dozen times anyway
<JustaBrony> 4is it at 9:00 EST?
<Dumori> about 15 min left
<Crazyjay> <PinkamenaDianePie> he popped em back
<MightyMatrix> That must of been hard with 2 broken fingers
<PonehMan> He seems to be having a bad day
<Zephirdd> that 4 out of 5 mares should be a lesbian or un-paired
<Zephirdd> lol
<DashOrCrash> and some cuts and bruises, and he's terrified out of his mind.
<General_Hazard> That too, I will never climb anything higher than maybe... ten feet. Dastardly afraid of heights
<Combustiblelemons> whats wrong with him?
<MuNova> Octavia: Idk how to do the hug/action thing here, but you can have a hug from me if you want! :)
<crickettwb> I'm going to stop talking now.

<DSNesmith> gaaaaah, discord
<Lasharus> I concur there Silverscreen.
<Cobalt> at the moment I'm on Dinkypage, going to bronystae.net itself does nothing.
*DSNesmith plugs ears
<fluttercry> or maybe he just watched MLP and decided to be nice
<Shadowx> back to my first questions, what are some great quotes besides, the 20% cooler and the pinkie pie so random? those are the only two i know

<Viethra> G1 and G4 are the best in my opinion
<JustaBrony> 0XD
<StarPlatinum> Time to die.
<a041744> Anyone else here participate in MLP-ATG-Alumni?
<Thunder_Dash> G4 > G1 > G3.5

<Caboozles> Well
<Zephirdd> Oh, so its a parody
<Slowter> Epic
<crickettwb> Dramatic villain monologues are never a good idea. Except for the fact that the good guys never seem to take advantage and just kill them.
<Caboozles> That...
<a041744> Suddenly sunlight
<StarmoonShroud> BEST SCENE EVAR!!!
<Seviper> I'm confused

<Shadowx> then pinkie pie threw a party... the end
<Cobalt> I'm having a bit of trouble reopening the stream through the main site. Going to http://bronystate.net/ then clicking Theatre brings me to the pony room selection, but clicking on a pony does nothing.
<Crazyjay> wow....great ending. That was a really good job
<mib_5qgerf> No, the point of the scene was to show the dude how he felt
<mib_1sn8rr> I have NO idea whats happening right now
<Drake> aside from when they killed some people
<Nyst> All he wanted was to live a little longer :(
<MuNova> Thunder_Dash: I remember nothing from when I used to watch MLP, lol. Should I continue avoiding the previous shows like the plague or what?
<VendorPony> PurpleFridge THAT
<Scootaloo> All I know is that it is currently streaming...embedded, and is working fine.
<Aponymous> MLP made me watch Doctor Who, now it makes me wanna watch Star Trek.
<Viethra> I was gonna everything>G3.5 but someone beat me to it
<BronyumHex> just rarely
<Cobalt> At the moment I'm going through http://dinkypage.com/bronystate-theaterlq to see the stream.
<DSNesmith> but yeah, I went through the stages in about a month :P
<Rookeealding> I bet he was freaking cold after that director called cut!
<Fluttershy`> ;___;
<Quinn197> yeah, short life-span
<EspyLacopa> And Q was known for just popping up during an episode to mess with Jean Luc Picard.
<StarPlatinum> Yeah.

<Luna> 07that works too
<StarmoonShroud> @Robikku no they don't sadly
<gic1898> >tossing a priceless custom revolver onto the ground
<Xzite> yea :D
<Vergil> A sequel?
<Viethra> G1 is acceptable I guess
<Scootaloo> so what is wrong with dinky page then?
<DashOrCrash> Never!
<MuNova> Norse: Totally, right?
*Luna is on mIRC

<Grundle> dunno
<Scootaloo> will it not work once the stream starts?
<Clonehunter> Scott is doing a sequel to what?
<Vergil> They're going to make a sequel to this?
<Barberaboy> Thanks luna!
<Darken_Skye> I will give scott the benefit of the doubt till I see the sequel
<Vergil> How?
<Shadowx> mods and their dutys, keep them away from their underlings
<Apokalipse> So guys have you ever been subjected to anti brony trolling?
*RMoD is on PCat
*VioletVanilla is on mIRC as well~
<Metostopholes> Words of wisdom from Captain Adama
<Grundle> Midnight Castle is pretty sweet
<Slowter> Because behind this mask, is an idea Mr. Johnson, and Ideas.....are bulletproof
<RMoD> *PChat
<Dumori> yeah
<SlurryMoon> It's raining outside for me.
*RobotPinkie hugs Fluttershy` "I'm scared"
<prince-dari> Nothing, we just don't use it any more.
<DSNesmith> then I let it slip accidentally-on-purpose to a few friends
<RAWRity> and that's how equestria was destroyed by skynet
<CCCPKiller> can anyone hear me?
<VioletVanilla> 6If you are having trouble with the stream, please join #derpy_hooves for all technical problems with the stream. But first, make sure you are on www.bronystate.net!
<crickettwb> Puppy The robot/thing decided to die. So he did.
<JustaBrony> 0BOOM HEADSAWT
<Lasharus> It must be awkward, holding your gun like that.
<EspyLacopa> Yup
<Xzite> its definetly worth reading, i laughed my ass of
<ValtheJean> 2,14 eeyup
<Combustiblelemons> not really
<Dumori> my Ex-GF slams me for it
<Norse> I'm listening to Mulan's "I'll make a man out of you" behind this.
<DSNesmith> then bought some brushables.... then went full brony
<everfreenights> ....pinkie?
<Dumori> like I give a fuck
<Norse> It's so awesome.
*Fluttershy` comforts RobotPinkie "shhhh"
<Saint_Absol> I enjoyed this
<DSNesmith> hah, nope, never been trolled
<MuNova> Thunder_Dash: Yeah, same. I feel too old to like the older ponies, plus I dislike the old art style. lol
<prince-dari> Why would we use it?
<SirDerpsalot> No, chat messages don't make noise.
<Suncatcher> he'd been dying for the last hour or so.
<Elky> I was pretty sure I was gonna like it before watching it
<GabeMoist> Before I started watching, I saw a hurt and heal thread on a forum and didn't want Fluttershy to win, so I voted Rainbow Dash
<prince-dari> We have a .net.
<sklar> DSNsmith i make sure everybody knows
<Katida> He let Harrison Ford live so someone could remember him.
<Meanwhile> I've never seen Mulan.
<cbpony9001> Ghost the host is best pony
<Cobalt> ok, chrome works.
*`Applejack is going to change his nick...don't want that "`" there
<EspyLacopa> The proper response is to give them a hug.
<Combustiblelemons> IDGAF about trolls
<Aponymous> I was like "Okay, I'll give it a shot" And the I was like "OMG PONIES ARE AMAZING!"
<trebthegamer> i've seen a review of the earlier g's
<Scootaloo> so if anything, I can still use it and will be fine?
<DSNesmith> people give me the usual wtf man?
<Crazyjay> <Slowter> very nice use of that one
<Norse> WAT
<SilkAMV> Shit got fingers broken, shit got saved from falling, then shit died.
<Shadowx> im happy i joined this channel
<NelBell> So, I'm a little out of the loop. S2 starts at 9 a.m. EST right?
<Norse> It's awesome.
<JustaBrony> 0 10 MINS!!!!
<Sir_Hoofalot> I wonder if it will have the "happy" ending...
<Rookeealding> G1 ain't all that bad.
<Dumori> yeah
<klaxa> guys
<prince-dari> Well it won't work.
<Suncatcher> they're built with a hard four year max lifespan.
<DSNesmith> but no dedicated pony haters
<Travis_Ball> Oh man... I just made cream
<CCCPKiller> uh oh dis dont look good
<Crazyjay> fucking love that quote
<Fluttershy`> Luna and VioletVanilla I don't understand mIRC o-o;
<StarmoonShroud> just watch
<Octavia> 13Indeed Shadowx :P
<Norse> Eeyup.
<SuperBrony64> Meanwhile: Missing out on a great movie!
<twinArmageddons> II love iit when myy iinternet cordd pop2 outta my computer, ggreat dday
<[ger]Brony1> Well, i hope it will be better than the sequel to the other 80's sci-fi cult-movie: Tron.
<everfreenights> .....mark?
<Quinn197> Mulan is quite good
<Digitalforehead> fans? doubt it. But I am exited to see what the movie's like.
<Travis_Ball> Mmmmm<3
<RMoD> Rachel?
<Pinkamena> What's the IRC network? I want to connect through xchat
<Viethra> Let's get down to business
<Combustiblelemons> Sharp wit finishes a troll in one.
<Cobalt> is there a way to get the HQ stream embedded?
<DSNesmith> I love the awkward looks whenever someone walks into my dorm
<Apokalipse> A troll tried to troll a pony thread on a forum I go to
<RMoD> RACHEL?
<ampson> Harrison Ford is best actor.
<Tehpogo> No. This is the 90s cut.
<BronyGuy> When does this movie end?
<klaxa> are you going to watch the announcement?
<Scootaloo> why does it work now?
<Shadowx> :D
<Vergil> G1 had pretty awesome villains.
<prince-dari> Currently someone is streaming LQ, so that will work.
<Rated-RPonyStar> 0Soon
<DSNesmith> and sees my little pony dolls all over my desk
<Quiltone> And just think folks. This is set just 8 years from now.
<Norse> Mulan makes me motivated.
<Vergil> But that's about it.
<Moondancer> NEVER
<Quinn197> To defeat
<Darken_Skye> How Prometheus turns out will probably determine whether or not I have high hopes about the Blade runner sequel
<Slowter> Thx Crazyjay
<gamemaster257> Press X to Rachel
<Apokalipse> He failed miserably because we loved and tolerated him
<Quinn197> the huns
<MrMaxaminus> I love it when, for a paragraph or two, the writing gets really good.
<EspyLacopa> lol
<Scootaloo> ok
<Caboozles> She dead
<SuperBrony64> Pinkamena: irc.bronystate.net
<General_Hazard> Man this movie is shorter than I remember

<DashOrCrash> wow, I just realized how much I've been talking on here
<trebthegamer> damn the made a total 1 80 with 4
<prince-dari> But this is one of the only times we've streamed LQ and HQ.
<djdexcat> Very soon, BronyGuy
<MuNova> Rookeealding: I may consider giving it a look then, if I end up with the time to... lol
<Nyst> And now to see what ending it will be.

<SlurryMoon> What's going to happen for Intermission, today?
<Grundle> Midnight Castle is the only pre-G4 pony I've seen thus far that I've enjoyed
<DashOrCrash> I should probably shut up...

<RMoD> Press X to Not Die
<EspyLacopa> THIS WORLD IS MADE OF LOVE AND PEACE!
<gamemaster257> do it
<Dumori> RD is my phone wall paper
<Tehpogo> Hence the lack of Ford voiceovers
<DSNesmith> and then try to not mention it at all
<gamemaster257> DO IT
<prince-dari> Almost 100% of the time dinkypage won't do anything for you.
<nah> do it
<Silverscreen> 11You know what I suddenly thought of?
<CCCPKiller> bahaha
<DSNesmith> it's hilarious
<Clonehunter> I keep getting this pause scene every few minutes. WHat up?

<Katida> For being a movie star, Harrison Ford is actually quite a good actor.
<SuperBrony64> Whoops, I mean irc.bronychat.net
<RobotPinkie> This movie shouldn't be as good as it is, I mean it doesn't have CG aliens in it or anything
<SuperBrony64> Pinkamena

<Silverscreen> 11Care Bears redone by Lauren Faust.
<Apokalipse> My cousin gave me a strange look when he saw my fluttershy wallpaper lol
<RAWRity> next week we should watch Cowboys and Aliens as a comparison for how much Ford had aged
<DSNesmith> except for the occasional guy who comes in
<Razyn> DSNesmith I'm laughing for real right now
<SirDerpsalot> Uh oh.
<mallam> 0gasp!
<gdpony> x..?
<DSNesmith> and goes
<Navy_Brony> Random Movie Fact: Ridley Scott never answered the question to fans of whether or not Harrison Ford was a replicant. After 20 years or so, and the release of the special edition, he finally answered that he is indeed, a replicant.
<StarPlatinum> ECKS!
<SlurryMoon> ooo
<MuNova> Lol, I've been on IRC with my BlazBlue.com buddies
<Luna> 07Clonehunter try the LQ stream

<MightyMatrix> This is the 1st time I seen this movie
<Zephirdd> no no no no no no
<House> She's dead, Jim
<kirzstryfe> no
<EspyLacopa> You should upfront ask one once: Which is better, Fluttershy or Pinkie Pie?
<DSNesmith> "Fuck yes."
<Octavia> 13Intermission video sucks. >:|
<Elky> I don't actually show my love for ponies

<SilkAMV> He's still the best thing in that movie
<ampson> still great though.
<Caboozles> How was that assumed?

<gamemaster257> silversceen Yes
<Crazyjay> SIlver screen..... no
<mallam> 0is the mlp movie going to be good?
<djdexcat> Well, a year ago, we woulda said the same thing about MLP
<SirReginald> Maybe, Silverscreen.
<Marelin> 2 barells too
<Combustiblelemons> nobody can tell its mlp :D
<DSNesmith> but he's not a brony
<Saint_Absol> I think it's implied at some points
<Norse> Gun has not enough triggers.
<GabeMoist> No one seems to care
<Slowter> Silverscreen: can it be done?
<RMoD> DOAR OPAN
<Fluttershy`> Silverscreen I don't think it would go over nearly as well as MLP did
<Suncatcher> yet.
<Happy-Kah> cuz earlyer
<DSNesmith> because he drew the G3 one
*Big_Macintosh is now pleased
<Cobalt> the LQ dinkypage stream appears to be the same quality as the HQ bronystate.net stream. huh.
<Zephirdd> and LF could remake it perfectly
<Darf14> Dang, I was hoping for a scary scene
<twinArmageddons> boo care bear2 2uck
<Happy-Kah> yeah
<Meanwhile> And then her face explodes and an alien jumps out and shlongs Ford in the eyeball.
<Aponymous> I don't have any merch. don't really want any either. Except maybe plushies.
<DSNesmith> I was like
<Singed_Iz_Brony> carebears were hardcore
<Norse> Also, Mulan music makes this better.
<Buytoast> Care Bears by Micheal Bay would be better.
<trebthegamer> up next: lottery for next weeks movies!
<DSNesmith> NOOOOO
<Nyst> Actually, I'd like to see Lauren redo a boy's show. Add more girl protagonists and such.
<Razyn> Is there anyone here who doesn't have something pony related in their room?
<RMoD> RACHEL RACHEL God shut UP
<eat911> @mallam no
<RobotPinkie> Is it really that bad, Octavia?
<Spazturtle> Pinkamena no its irc.ponychat.net

<DSNesmith> so I dragged him out of his room

<mallam> 0ok lol
<GabeMoist> There was one guy I saw on facebook who is apparently a brony
<MrMaxaminus> I thought about a Strawberry Shortcake reboot awhile ago.
<DSNesmith> and showed him the proper one
<Solarboy27> The MyLittlePony movie is definitely not bad, it's not amazing, but it's not bad.
<EmmettBrown> damn,I've got pis and needles in my foot
<a041744> Atleast he can still do the vulcan salute
<Singed_Iz_Brony> That is win right there, people
<everfreenights> silverscreen: still crap, carebears has no capacity for improvement
<sklar> DSNesmith thats a war crime
<Navy_Brony> Quote from earlier: "That test you run. Have you ever tested yourself?"
<DashOrCrash> For Science.
