<prince-dari> Ok.
<prince-dari> Stream's up, quality is as low as possible. >_>
<Pattyrick> Back
<Dermathil> alright play
<EdwardNewgate> YAY
<Ziltoid> Now I cant see anything
*Pegacorn explodes
<Nick> wb Patt
<prince-dari> You like that quality? :P
<Ziltoid> all I see is pxels
<Pattyrick> SIM card problems caused my iPad to not receive 3G 0__o
<EdwardNewgate> NO LAG
<RandomExtra> Looks watchable to me.
<Dman> >obviously
<ValtheJean> you know...this episode really didn't get me hooked into the show
<prince-dari> REX!
<ValtheJean> it just felt really forced
<Dermathil> REX!!!
<Dermathil> YAYA
<ValtheJean> and...meh...
<Dermathil> REX IS YAAAAAAAAAAAAY!
<Pegacorn> God.Why won't i die?!
<Dman> >huh, cool
<prince-dari> INB4 kid gets eaten
<Dermathil> ANOMALY!!!!!!
<Dermathil> ohshi
<EdwardNewgate> suddenly running?
<Ziltoid> oh hi
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<HyperMetalLugia> Hahah
<nickstr> that happens to most wireless devices from time to time
<HyperMetalLugia> Wifi requires no SIM card :P
<nickstr> I have a Brew MP based phone that had a SIM card error
<nickstr> shut up
<prince-dari> Eat the kid.
<HyperMetalLugia> And 3G is terrible
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<prince-dari> DO EET
<HyperMetalLugia> No thanks
<nickstr> keep your bias to yourself please
<nickstr> I am simply trying to say something that is actually constructive
<ValtheJean> I'd rather it eat the protagonists, thus ending the show :P
<Dermathil> DON'T SAY THAT VAL
<HyperMetalLugia> So are my words
<Dermathil> ANOMALY!!!!!!
<nickstr> nope
<prince-dari> Protagonists die later.
<HyperMetalLugia> It's created lines and sentences
<nickstr> yours are bashing
<prince-dari> You'll have to wait.
<ValtheJean> eh...the show just doesn't catch my attention
<Ziltoid> >game of thrones
<nickstr> you just bashed the iPad
<nickstr> and cellular data services
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm just stating a fact
<Dman> Dari - still vectorin' RBD pic. Taking FOREVEEEEER.
<ValtheJean> it kinda bores me tbh
<nickstr> I don't know
<nickstr> those are OPINIONS
<HyperMetalLugia> 3G can be very slow
<nickstr> not facts
<HyperMetalLugia> 4G is fast compared to 3G
<nickstr> when you said "3G is terrible" that is your opinion
<nickstr> not a fact
<Pattyrick> Fixed; just had to Reinsert it
<prince-dari> But you never even got to the predators.
<Dermathil> shhh
<Ziltoid> OH NO A PIXEL MONSTER
<prince-dari> And Becker.
<HyperMetalLugia> 3G can be slow compared to Wifi
<prince-dari> Becker so awesome.
<Dermathil> OH YEAH
<Dman> lol
<Pattyrick> My 3G is so
<nickstr> 3G has better coverage than WIFI too
<Dermathil> YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FUTURE PREDATORS.
<HyperMetalLugia> Well 3G is terrible because it is slow and sometimes the signal gets lost :P
<nickstr> can you get WIFI out on the highway?
<prince-dari> BITCHES DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY HORRIBLE MONSTERS
<ValtheJean> eh...if the first episode can't sell it for me, I don't watch the show
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<HyperMetalLugia> Well I don't think most owners of Wifi have an antenna that big
<Pattyrick> metimes faster than my Wi-F
<prince-dari> The first two episodes of FiM didn't sell it for me.
<EdwardNewgate> It seems like a sci-fi soap opera
<prince-dari> I'm still gladI continued watching.
<Espeon> 06so much black text
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes
<prince-dari> glad I*
<ValtheJean> well, that's you :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Hai Espeon
<nickstr> can you get WIFI on ALL busses or ALL trains or ALL vehicles?
<Angel_Espeon> 13u racist?
*Angel_Espeon runs
<Espeon> 06pink/purple master race etc, AKA Nope.
<HyperMetalLugia> Of course not, but Wifi wasn't meant for traveling
*Espeon poofs again
<Pattyrick> Brb, testing my iPad's SIM card in my dad's iPhone
<HyperMetalLugia> 3G WAS
<prince-dari> Wut
<Dermathil> what happened?
<HyperMetalLugia> So when 3G does get out of range, there is a problem
<prince-dari> >video stops playing
<Dman> BLOODY FINGER. HNNNNG SO REAL!
<Dermathil> FFFFF
<Dman> Dari - happens when internet cut off and then joined again
<Dman> Just stream like 2 seconds ahead of wher u r
<Luna> honestly
<Dman> it shud load it
<Luna> No one needs to be connected all the time
<Luna> So what's the problem?
<Dermathil> Did it stop loading?
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<prince-dari> My fault.
<Dman> Dari just click haead so it streams ahead
<prince-dari> I was screwing around with the packets it was sending earlier.
<Dman> then click back so it streams again from ther
<prince-dari> Dman, that won't work.
<prince-dari> Connection to the server is broked. XD
<ValtheJean> brb
<Dman> ok
<HyperMetalLugia> I'd just like a service that doesn't cut out and require cards to work?
<Ziltoid> MEAT
<HyperMetalLugia> Like Patty and his constant disconnects
<prince-dari> EAT THE KID
<Ziltoid> OMNOMNOMNOM
<Pegacorn> I'm watching vids on YouTube,so i'm afk.
<prince-dari> Lol
<prince-dari> He kicked it.
<Ziltoid> OH NO MUSIC
<Rodman> As you know, reptiles HAET music
<nickstr> municipal WIFI fell flat on its face years ago
<nickstr> so sorry
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> LIGHTSABER
<Rodman> TESLA LANTERNS DON'T WORK LIKE THAT
<Dermathil> DAT LIGHTSABER
<nickstr> you are forced to have cards if you want internet access when you leave your home and are in areas without WIFI
<Luna> No matter what you choose, the connection will cut out and now that most wifi places are locked, require vertification anywau
<Rodman> Dat mom is a bitch!
<Luna> 4G even moreso, since it hasn't been out for that long
<ctr> Have you all heard?
<ctr> PS3 pricecut
<HyperMetalLugia> But since phones can cut out, what happens when you really need them but the signal can't reach?
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol PS3
<ctr> 249 euros/dollars now
<Soital> 12o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> So many pricecuts later
<ctr> because i'm bored and watching the sony press conference
<Luna> if you're in the middle of nowhere being chased my murders
<Luna> No network is going to help you if your cell can't reach it
<ValtheJean> awww
<Luna> *murderers
<ValtheJean> I missed the part where the kid almost dies
<RobotPinkie> have a decent vectorized RD now, lolz
<ValtheJean> that was the only entertaining part :P
<HyperMetalLugia> So why'd you be in the middle of nowhere?
<Rodman> Yippee!
<prince-dari> The kid escaped.
<Luna> "the signal can't reach"
<Rodman> Stupid not-dead kid :(
<Luna> In most cities/towns, you can get cell service anywhere
<ValtheJean> hence "almost" dies :P
<Luna> Even if it's not 3G/4G/wifi, you still have enough service for an emergency
<RobotPinkie> so did the black guy get eaten?
<EdwardNewgate> rocks 'n things. good description kid
<Rodman> Suuuuuuuuure, blame the telly woman
<HyperMetalLugia> You hope :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Never trust wireless period
<HyperMetalLugia> As there can be a million random events thatr could ruin your connection
<Luna> like?
<RobotPinkie> They came from the rift in space/time that goes through Cardiff
<prince-dari> LOL
<Dermathil> LOL
<Dermathil> Kinda
<HyperMetalLugia> Weather, buildings, distance and dead zones
<Dermathil> HAHAQHA
<nickstr> much of it is due to the physics of the frequencies used
<ValtheJean> it begins...
<nickstr> GSM phones typically use three bands
<Dermathil> My Little Primeval: Anomalies are Magic
<Rodman> PORTAL 3 STARTS HERE!
<nickstr> 800 MHz, 900 MHz, and 1.8 GHz
<ValtheJean> and then links into a crossover OF EVERY TV SHOW EVAR
<HyperMetalLugia> You can be right next to the radio station, and still get a bad signal :P
<nickstr> high UHF
<RobotPinkie> I'd love time travel in Portal 3
<Luna> yeah nickstr
<ValtheJean> still haven't played portal 2 actually
<RobotPinkie> like looking through a portal and seeing the past, how ace would that be?
<nickstr> that is due to the signals being very much line of sight
<nickstr> I think CDMA uses the same bands too
<Rodman> That'd be sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!
<Dermathil> LOL
<RobotPinkie> Portal 2 is highly recommended, favorite game this year... thus far
<Dermathil> Threw his frontdoor key through the anomaly
<ValtheJean> I dunno
<RobotPinkie> but then again, Skyrim is coming out...
<ValtheJean> I mean...I loved portal 1
<ValtheJean> but...I just don't want to get my hopes up again
<prince-dari> HELLEN
<HyperMetalLugia> I just wonder why we don't use regular radio signals, those seem to work a bit better
<ValtheJean> I'm just so sick of valve sequels sucking ass
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie, Portal 2 is going to be better than Anything Skyrim could ever be
<nickstr> government allocations
<ValtheJean> false
<ctr> quality
<RobotPinkie> It's nothing like... completely revolutionary
<ValtheJean> mega false
<Dermathil> ValtheJean, you are always way too hyped
<ctr> and bandwidth
<nickstr> and bandwidth required
<Rodman> These idiots need armed soldiers at the portal where freaking dinosaurs can come and go at a whim
<Dermathil> You can only be disappointed
<RobotPinkie> it's just like Portal 1, essentially, but much higher budget
<nickstr> the higher up you go in frequency the more practical it is to run broadband wireless services
<prince-dari> Ohai Lester
<ValtheJean> I am always way too hyped?
<Dermathil> LESTER
<Dermathil> LESTER IS COOLIO
<HyperMetalLugia> So sending a video signal and a audio signal over the air doesn't use as much bandwidth as a single phone cal?
<HyperMetalLugia> *call
<ValtheJean> Robot: that's exactly what I'm worried about
<HyperMetalLugia> Why can't we just use both
<RobotPinkie> Lester the Unlikely
<prince-dari> Lester vs Predators
<nickstr> analog audio uses less bandwidth
<Dermathil> ^^
<Dermathil> Lester wins:
<nickstr> an average FM broadcast station uses 150 KHz of bandwidth
<nickstr> this includes the baseband audio and subcarriers for stereo along with RDS
<ValtheJean> Lester Pilgrim vs Predators
<nickstr> TV uses about 6 MHz of bandwidth
<nickstr> analog or digital
<ctr> And wifi?
<Rodman> Scott Pilgrim vs Lester
<nickstr> WIFI uses maybe 10 or 20 MHz
<Dermathil> Lester wins
<nickstr> but its done at 2.4 GHz so this is not really an issue
<RobotPinkie> well, I'd say keep your expectations on the level that it's just Portal 2 with more levels
<RobotPinkie> lol I mean Portal 1 with more levels
<Dermathil> (You don't know nothing about the predators.)
<ValtheJean> but that's exactly what I don't want
<RobotPinkie> that way you probably won't be disappointed
<ValtheJean> I have portal 1, and was pleased
<Pegacorn> gtg guys
<ValtheJean> if I'm going to buy P2, I want a different game
<nickstr> although bear in mind the band is shared
<ValtheJean> later pegacorn
<RobotPinkie> bai Pegacorn
<ctr> and wifi is around 50-100 mbit/s
<nickstr> people using WIFI are actually SECONDARY
<Dermathil> http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090321022150/primeval/images/0/0d/Future_Predator_3.jpg
<Dermathil> PICTURE
<Ziltoid> bye pegacorn
<nickstr> 2.4 GHz is primarily an amateur radio allocation worldwide
<ctr> and a Microwave allocation XD
<Dermathil> Say hello to the future predator
<nickstr> well yes it is
<Rodman> Bye Pegacron, Destroyer of Worlds
<RobotPinkie> well it IS different, it's much more story driven, the new puzzle elements actually add something to the game
<ctr> when mom microwaves popcorn my wifi gets jammed
<nickstr> although some consider 2.4 GHz to be high UHF still
<prince-dari> Escape Rex!
<Dman> epic music
<Dermathil> FLY AWAY REX!!!
<Dermathil> GOOOOO!
<RobotPinkie> I'm just saying if you're worried about being disappointed, keep your expectations low :P
<nickstr> your oven might use 2.3 or 2.4 GHz
<nickstr> many do
<Dermathil> ^^
<Dman> ^_
<Dman> ^_^ *
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> Gets in the lift.
<Dermathil> hahaha
<prince-dari> Dat muzak
<nickstr> I had an issue with Sirius satellite radio where when a microwave oven was used the signal would be jammed
<Ziltoid> this is my jam
<Dermathil> DANCING REX
<RobotPinkie> ...I love that lizard
<nickstr> but now I miss having satellite radio
<Dermathil> eeyup!
<nickstr> because Indianapolis AM and FM radio is utter crap
<Dermathil> He's a popular character
<ctr> webradio?
<nickstr> no data on my cellular phone
<RobotPinkie> oh he stays on the show?
<Dermathil> (why does he have a name?)
<Ziltoid> REx is pretty boos
<Dermathil> ^^
<Ziltoid> boss*
<RobotPinkie> w00t
<ctr> 64kbit/s isn't so hard on my phone
<Dermathil> HAHAHA
<nickstr> I mean I don't have a data account
<Ziltoid> trolololol
<prince-dari> Taking a shit on the boss.
<nickstr> mine is text and voice only
<ctr> Oh.
<prince-dari> Sorry Lester.
<HyperMetalLugia> Dial-up speeds?
<Dermathil> ^^
<nickstr> so I have to put up with whatever crap Cumulus and Emmis feels like offering
<Dermathil> Really bad news
<Luna> that sucks
<Rodman> Rex takes a shit like a BAWS
<nickstr> those two companies own all the commercial radio stations in Indianapolis
<nickstr> in fact I am getting serious about running my own
<Dermathil> (who said that was Rex's footprint?)
<prince-dari> Like a baws
<prince-dari> On a boss
<ctr> here where I live in sweden we have MTG Group as the commercial radio monopoly
<nickstr> blame media deregulation

<prince-dari> Damn this dinosaur is a paedophile.
<prince-dari> Always after the children.
<nickstr> yea but it helps listeners
<ValtheJean> my kinda dinosaur
<Rodman> PEDO-SAUR IS ON THE LOOSE!
<ValtheJean> er....I mean
<ValtheJean> <.< >.>
<nickstr> more varied programing
<Luna> They don't care about the listeners
<Pattyrick> I went through the Umbria region of Italy today :3
<Dermathil> OSHIT
<Dermathil> RUN FROM THE GORGONOPSID
<Rodman> HOW THE FUCK DID IT GET IN!?!?!?!
<nickstr> those greedy ba*tards
<prince-dari> Through the door maybe?
<prince-dari> :P
<Luna> They make you listen to what they want you to hear. It's not just piracy making all those small CD shops going down
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Rodman> Come on, eat the teacher!
<nickstr> which is basically what ever is in the top 40 or on their "safe list"
<Luna> Yeap
<nickstr> this is why radio is going down the toilet
<Luna> *h
<Dermathil> COME GET SOME YOU MONSTER
<RobotPinkie> I'm calling it, he's Mr Hero Guy
<Dermathil> He's the point man
<Dermathil> not the hero
<nickstr> and why everyone just listens to portable media players these days
*Umbreon throws CDs at Luna
<Dermathil> Cutter is the "hero"
<RobotPinkie> Oh okay
<Luna> And not only that, bands just starting get offers from big label companies mostly because they sound like another hit band
<Dermathil> Mister on screen is the pointman/gun master
<Dermathil> PURPLE SHIRT ON SCREEN
<Pattyrick> *Inserts his Red Hot Chili Peppers 'By The Way' CD into his mom's car's CD player
<Pattyrick> *
<nickstr> I actualy run my own low power AM and FM station right now
<Luna> Creed was picked up because they sounded like Nickelback, Nickelback was picked up because they sounded like... I think it was Pearl Jam they said
<Rodman> Notice how the purple shirt hasn't said a peep?
<nickstr> but I am in the process of improving the range for both sides
<Rodman> Me says he dies first
<RobotPinkie> Someone's about to get shipped..... with a dinosaur...
<Umbreon> 12and justin bieber was picked up because he sounds like........ girl
<nickstr> and trying to find a computer I can dedicate to this purpose
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Pattyrick> LOL
<Luna> Yes! Umbreon's got it :P
<Pattyrick> It's true
<Luna> Is that the new RHCP CD Patty?
<Luna> I don't really like them, but I do like their new single
<nickstr> the coverage issues boil down to antennas on both sides

<Pattyrick> 's what I meant to say
<nickstr> their semiconductor division is gone too
<prince-dari> HELEN!

<ctr> Their semiconductor division belongs to freescale
<prince-dari> OH MAH GAWD
<prince-dari> HELEN!
<ctr> beat me
<Dermathil> HELEN!
<Dermathil> SHE FLEEING AGAIN
<Luna> Glacymr is mean
<Dman> Press X to 'Helen'
<Glacymr> 12:)
<ValtheJean> that wife is a god damn troll
<nickstr> the tuner I have is using one of their semiconductors
<prince-dari> SHE BE TROLLIN' HIM HIM
<Glacymr> 12now you got it
<nickstr> the MC13020
<RobotPinkie> uploading... hopefully it accepts files this hueg
<Dermathil> BITCH!!! YOU GOT 3 YEARS OF KITCHENING TO CATCH UP ON
<ValtheJean> 'JASOOON....err...I mean HELLLEEEEEEEN"
<Dermathil> GET BACK HERE
<prince-dari> More wilhelm scream next episode.

<prince-dari> There's wilhelm screams in most episodes. XD
<RobotPinkie> It's..... very big
<Dman> ...Bene
<RobotPinkie> 3000x4000 about
<Dman> It's perfect
<Dermathil> NEXT EPISODE: BIG INSECTS
<RobotPinkie> Yay!
<nickstr> its a medium voltage 24 pin DIP IC
<Dman> needs to be dari
<ValtheJean> kinky
<Dman> zoom for eyes :P
<Rodman> Holy crap, it IS big
<Rodman> Dari likes
<RobotPinkie> haha, yeah

<Rodman> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
<Dermathil> YES
<ValtheJean> lol
<ctr> well the best thing motorola's done is the glorious 68000
<RobotPinkie> yeah, it seems really quite good
<ValtheJean> dari, despite your god damn trollish nature
<Rodman> Unless Megavideo be mad
<ValtheJean> I <3 you for that scream
<nickstr> that one is a 32 bit microprocessor
<Glacymr> 12yay new pokemon vietnamese crystal episode
<Dermathil> EENOPE
<ValtheJean> other than me?
<Dman> [AJ] Hmm...Nah
<Rodman> I got to go to sleep, unfortunately :(
<nickstr> the MC13020 is a decoder for their AM stereo system basically
<ctr> I've learned 68K assembly just so i could make sonic hacks
<Dman> I don't mind it
<ValtheJean> nah tis good
<Dman> is what I meant
<ValtheJean> I'll just keep insulting it like Durrgarr
<nickstr> the 68000 series processor was also used in the Apple Lisa and early Macintosh machines
<Rodman> OH!
<Rodman> MORE DERPY!
<ValtheJean> TALLY HO
<ValtheJean> say it dari
<Pattyrick> I wish I knew as much about radios as you peoplez did
<ValtheJean> SAY IT
<ValtheJean> SAY TALLY HO
<Rodman> Dari be derping hard
<ValtheJean> :D
<ValtheJean> and then everypony came
<nickstr> I might be the one that knows the most
<nickstr> I play around with this stuff quite a bit
<nickstr> and hold a valid amateur radio license
<ValtheJean> IT AINT MY FAULT YOUR COUNTRY DELAYS LIKE FUCK
<RobotPinkie> haha
<ValtheJean> damn...he knows of my secret organization to destroy all foreigners
<RobotPinkie> @pony The LEAST derpy pony
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The LEAST derpy pony is 14Silver S15poon
<Dermathil> and then chanserv came.
<Dermathil> CHANSERV IS AN IT
<ValtheJean> chanserv is a herm, duh
<Dermathil> MWAHAHAHAH
<Pattyrick> That's pretty neat
<RobotPinkie> now Serv-chan, on the other hand....
<ctr> hard to broadcast "standard" radio from center of downtown here XD
<ValtheJean> IT KNOWS
<Dermathil> (you ain't heard an evil laugh 'til you heard mine. Tell 'em, Dman.)
<ctr> at the 4th floor of an apartment building
<nickstr> on FM I guess
<nickstr> you have to deal with lots of multipath due to reflections from buildings
<RobotPinkie> CONNECTION PROBLEMCEPTION!
<Pattyrick> Around here, I'm a roller coaster nerd :P
<nickstr> with AM you don't have to worry about that too much
<nickstr> but sadly most people own AM receivers that are to be honest a piece of junk
<nickstr> telephone quality sound
<Dman> (Dermathil redefines evil laughs)
<Rodman> Dermathil, Dman
<Rodman> Bitches please!
<Rodman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J1HqdQl6dw&feature=related
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Zim&#39;s Laugh!" - "Zim&#39;s Laugh!"
<ctr> well
<ctr> mine's broken
<nickstr> I have a few wideband AM receivers
<nickstr> and even a wideband AM stereo receiver
<ValtheJean> omg I love Invader zim
<nickstr> the AM ones sound very much like mono FM
<ValtheJean> inb4 GAH BEEEEEEES
<Pattyrick> There are very few AM stations around here
<nickstr> and the AM stereo receiver with my transmitter actually matches FM stereo
*Dermathil has an evil laugh on par with Doctor Evil.
<Pattyrick> But almost all of the FM slots are taken up!
<Rodman> Oh Dari, you and your 4 key
<nickstr> AM is being vacated in Europe
<ctr> pretty much no AM in sweden
<nickstr> an example being RTE left the AM broadcast band in 2008
<ValtheJean> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZs39wggIW4
<RobotPinkie> I guess it's time for some........ refreshments...
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "Invader Zim - Bees" - "Invader Zim Yells about Bees"
<nickstr> not to mention Radio Sweden shut down ALL AM operations
<nickstr> including shortwave and longwave
<ctr> exactly
<Pattyrick> Wow
<nickstr> RAI still does AM though
<ValtheJean> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qTQEJjt9n0&feature=related
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "TAK IS AFTER MY ROBOT BEE!!!" - "CURSE YOU, TAK!!!!!!!!!!! CURSE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!"
<Pattyrick> That's too bad
<nickstr> and shortwave
<ctr> radio sweden exists on internets though
<RobotPinkie> does the transparency work, btw, Dman?
<nickstr> although part of it is digital
<nickstr> through DRM
<ValtheJean> dat is one freaky ass bug
<nickstr> that is what I heard
<Dermathil> meh
<nickstr> they are continuing through the internet
<nickstr> kind of pointless though
<ValtheJean> kill it
<Dermathil> I saw one like that fly inside my hamburger one day.
<ValtheJean> kill it
<ValtheJean> WITH FIRE
<ctr> Anyone remember the days of Realplayer and 16kbit/s webradio?
<ctr> and buffering
<RobotPinkie> Hornets are the cutest creatures on earth
<Dermathil> I threw it in the garbage bin
<ValtheJean> until they fucking bite you
<Pattyrick> AM, although not as high quality as FM, is still a pretty reliable source for information
<ValtheJean> the glass is upside down
<Rodman> This community is all about love and tolerance
<ValtheJean> implying the person trapped it there
<Rodman> Except to bees
<nickstr> the issue is partially receivers
<Pattyrick> You can get it a lot easier than F
<nickstr> like I mentioned
<Pattyrick> M
<Rodman> FUCK THOSE GUYS, KILL EM WITH FIAR!!!!!
<nickstr> another issue is sadly the growing levels of electrical interference
<ValtheJean> phff, then she's fucking stupid
<Pattyrick> Yup
<ValtheJean> because he'll come back with his hornet friends
<Rodman> BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
<Dermathil> Dari, mind showing the picture of the brits in line to plunder a shop?
<ValtheJean> and come to fucking kill her
<Dermathil> NOT THE BEES!
<ValtheJean> hey, I love bees
<Dermathil> OH GOD IN MY EYES!
<ValtheJean> I hate hornets
<nickstr> a number of AM receivers actually have noise blankers
<ValtheJean> they kill beees
<Pattyrick> Cell phones, computers, electricity, etc
<Dermathil> NOT THE BEES!!!!!
<nickstr> that helps with most problems
<prince-dari> Dermathil: I haven't seen it.
<ValtheJean> and feed the bee corpses to their young
*RobotPinkie fires the bees in a kiln.
<nickstr> unfortunately its the expensive ones that do
<Rodman> Dman, how's it coming?
<Pattyrick> We didn't listen to much AM on my mom's Toyota Highlander
<Rodman> Harsh on what?
<ValtheJean> HEY I DON'T KILL BEES
<RobotPinkie> trololol
<Rodman> BEE LOVER!
<nickstr> did you bring that over from the US?
<ValtheJean> interesting fact:
<Dermathil> VOLUME HIGHER
<Pattyrick> Yup
<nickstr> you can't anyway
<RobotPinkie> Previously, on Paradise Beach
<ValtheJean> Einstein predicted the end of society would begin with the extinction of bees
<nickstr> wrong band step
<Pattyrick> 2003 Toyota Highlander; comes with the stock Toyota radio
<Dman> Rodman - good, making pic zoom slowly :P
<nickstr> as I mentioned before
<Dman> I AM sorta afk on it too thou
<Dman> stupid kid in the room
<RobotPinkie> aw...
<ValtheJean> because
<Rodman> Previously, on "The Diary of Steven Magnet"
<ValtheJean> you have to pay for it
<Pattyrick> I can't listen to AM here in Italy?
<Dermathil> Prince-dari, they can't manage to take them down
<Dman> oh sorry robotpinkie missed ur comment
<Dman> yah
<ValtheJean> megavideo pays for the copyright
<ValtheJean> oh wait
<ValtheJean> no
<ValtheJean> I'm wrong
<Dermathil> That's why the bill in the US was trying to illegalize streaming
<ValtheJean> some vids on megavideo do get removes
<nickstr> nope
<ValtheJean> removed*
<RobotPinkie> Oh good
<Dermathil> They want to take websites like Megavideo down
<nickstr> because that tuner is designed for the US 10 KHz band step
<ValtheJean> it depends on whether or not the companies bother to send the cease and desist
<Dermathil> yeah
<ValtheJean> yeah
<ValtheJean> I've seen a few get removed
<nickstr> not the 9 KHz band step used in Asia, Europe, Oceania, and Africa
<ValtheJean> someone puts them BACK pretty quickly
<Pattyrick> I'll have to listen to it in my dad's 1998 Alfa Romeo 156
<Rodman> But since they made the whole thing too big, it affects the whole media industry.
<ValtheJean> but they do get removed
<Dermathil> exactly
<Rodman> So, they go freaking GOOGLE lawyers on their side
<nickstr> that one might include longwave too
<Pattyrick> That should work, then
<nickstr> its kind of a neat band
<Rodman> *got
<nickstr> under the right conditions you can hear all of Europe at night
<Dman> Twi?
<RobotPinkie> HAHA
<ValtheJean> hahaha
<Dman> LOOOOOOL
<Pattyrick> It has a Pioneer faceplate but a stock Alfa radio, I believe
<RobotPinkie> OF COURSE!
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHA
<Rodman> Awwww yeaaaaaah!
<ValtheJean> that is so epic
<Rodman> M. Bison YES!
<nickstr> that Toyota radio can tune in a few 9 KHz step frequenceis
<nickstr> for example 1440
<ValtheJean> lol, if you wanted to be boring you could stream an entire video game playthrough
<nickstr> but on that one there might be a problem from time to time
<Pattyrick> I'll have to remember to ask dad to do that next time
<ValtheJean> like heavy rain
<nickstr> you might hear HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<RobotPinkie> naw, Heavy Rain is too entertaining to watch
<nickstr> because that transmitter is owned by RTL in Germany
<Pattyrick> That's what I usually hear
<ValtheJean> eh, the playthroughs are boring
<Rodman> Stream Amnesia
<nickstr> and they run DRM transmissions much of the time
<Rodman> >:[D
<ValtheJean> I can only play that game, I can't stand watching it
<Rodman> Amnesia?
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<ValtheJean> I still haven't played amnesia
<ValtheJean> I really want to
<ValtheJean> no heavy rain
<Rodman> Oh, ok
<nickstr> this basically is the RTL Radio pop music format
<Rodman> Mrs. Twilight, I question your intentions.
<Pattyrick> Hmmm
<RobotPinkie> @pony The pony that stars in the next clopfic dari reads live
<Steven_Magnet> 6 The pony that stars in the next clopfic dari reads live is 8Bo12nB13on
<nickstr> with a DRM receiver you can hear RTL Radio on 1440 in stereo
<Dman> FFFUUUU problems again with vegas pro recognising transparency D:
<Pattyrick> I remember hearing HD radio for the first time
<Pattyrick> It was pretty cool
<ValtheJean> you could play 20 questions to the challenge I gave you yesterday :P
<RobotPinkie> Try redoing the process you did before?
<Rodman> didn't you turn it into a gif before to make it work?
<nickstr> DRM is about the same thing on MW/LW/SW
<Dermathil> watch this episode
<Pattyrick> Sooooo clear xD
<ctr> we have cable radio here XD
<nickstr> except its an open standard
<RobotPinkie> Doctor Who?
<Dermathil> yeah!
<Rodman> I'm just going to sleep right now
<Dermathil> Do that!
<prince-dari> Or...
<Rodman> Night everybrony
<Dman> Doo eet
<ValtheJean> gnight rodman
<RobotPinkie> night Rodman
<prince-dari> You could watch Doctor Who. :P
<nickstr> in fact I like DRM a bit more than AM HD Radio
<Dman> night Rodman
<Dermathil> I am okay for Doctor Who
<ValtheJean> okay dari
<ValtheJean> so
<ValtheJean> I've never watched a dr who ep
<ValtheJean> you have ONE ep to prove to me its worth :P
<Pattyrick> Would I be able to adjust our car's radio to get 9 KHz?
<Dman> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<ValtheJean> show me your best one :P
<nickstr> and might experiment with DRM on the standard AM broadcast band
<nickstr> maybe
<nickstr> but it will be a highly technical procedure
<Dermathil> OH YES.
<ValtheJean> I'd usually just mute it and go to work <.< >.>
<nickstr> where soldering experience is manditory
<Pattyrick> Could you do it?
<Dermathil> We've watched the entire first series already
<Dermathil> Yeah
<Dermathil> and blink is amazing!
<nickstr> I might be able to do this kind of mod
<Dman> Blink is a good ep
<RobotPinkie> lolol show him Blink, then
<nickstr> usually there will be an area on the circuit board to solder in parts like diodes for example to change the receiver's localization mode
<nickstr> if a microcontroler is involved with tuning
<RobotPinkie> We're like... one season away
<Pattyrick> Where are you? How far would you have to fly to fix our car's radio? :P
<Dermathil> I think Blink is Series 3
<nickstr> I am in Indiana in the US
<Pattyrick> Ok
<Dman> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF VEGAS PRO Y U NO RECOGNISE TRANSPARENCY
<Barry> Hallo
<Dman> blink is s03ep10 i think
<RobotPinkie> myeah, I think it's the 9th episode of season 3 or something
<Pattyrick> Mmmmm..... Indiana Beach
<Dman> Hey Barry
<Barry> How are ya, DMan?
<nickstr> not far from Indianapolis
<RobotPinkie> haven't seen it in a long time, too
<Pattyrick> Wish I could visit that theme park
<Pattyrick> Oh, ok
<nickstr> I could
<RobotPinkie> ohai again, Barry
<nickstr> its in central Indiana
<Dman> Good Barry
<Pattyrick> I'm in Teverola, Campania, Italy
<Dman> I'm working on a vid that rodman and robotpinkie helped with ^_^
*ValtheJean is waiting with baited breath
<Barry> How are ya, Robotpinkie?
<Dman> just stupid vid software no recognise transparency
<nickstr> yikes
<RobotPinkie> I'm fairly pony, you?
<Pattyrick> But, like I said before, I'm from Washington state
<Dman> yay i got well done'd :P
<nickstr> from near Seattle as I recall
<RobotPinkie> What did you do before to make it work, Dman?
<Pattyrick> About 1 1/2 hrs away
<Pattyrick> Little town called Seabeck
<RobotPinkie> MEOWCEPTION SOON
<Dman> Robotpinkie - made background transparent in over 5 pic softwares
<prince-dari> Stream's offline
<Dman> doing so now
<Dman> till one is recognised : (
<prince-dari> Checking if I can raise quality yet.
<RobotPinkie> oh okay
<nickstr> I lived in Toledo
<RobotPinkie> weird
<Dman> : /
<prince-dari> I'm thinking probably not.
<Dman> i will not give up thou
<prince-dari> But meh.
<nickstr> which is about a couple hours from Seattle
<prince-dari> Worth a try.
<nickstr> in southern Lewis County
<RobotPinkie> Didn't you turn off transparency and then make it transparent again, or something? I don't remember
<Dman> Yea i should do that :P
<Pattyrick> You remembered the whole saying for some radio station; which one was it again?
<Pattyrick> I forget
<nickstr> that one was KGHO 920
<nickstr> out of Olympia
<nickstr> when they were running oldies
*Ray||Tf2 yawns
<nickstr> I listened to them on a daily basis
<Pattyrick> I remember it was from Olympia
<prince-dari> Hmm
<prince-dari> Ok.
<prince-dari> Stream's up.
<Pattyrick> In the same way that my mom listened to 95.7 KJR FM every day
<nickstr> yes
<Pattyrick> Hi ctr
<RobotPinkie> it's freezing for me, every couple of seconds
<nickstr> as I said I even remember the receiver I had at the time
<Dermathil> yeah, it is skipping, dari.
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Dermathil> laggy stream.
<ValtheJean> definite skips
<nickstr> a Sony SRF-42 AMAX certified AM stereo/FM stereo Walkman
<Pattyrick> Hi Quan
<prince-dari> There's no skips on the preview.
<nickstr> great sounding tuner
<Dermathil> well it is laggy for us.
<Dermathil> It might be between you and us
<Dermathil> (could it be due to the buffering of the other video? maybe try closing everything else that isn't really necessary?)
<Pattyrick> I have the TuneIn Radio app on all of my iDevices
<nickstr> I have it on my Android devices
<Pattyrick> I wonder if I can get any good broadcasts fro the past...
<ctr> i haves it
<Pattyrick> How do you like Android?
<ctr> i don't like their new design of some reaosn
<ctr> of tune in
<Pattyrick> Hmmm
<Pattyrick> I haven't used it a lot
<Dman> YES

<Dermathil> Jumpy
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Yep, saw it.

<Dermathil> I think it may be because of everything else you have open on your computer.
<Nick> thoughts?

<Ziltoid> derp
<lightumbreon> 06wb Anthony!
<drf|laptop> 03there's 3 discs total, but you probably don't need the second two
<Glacymr> 12okay o-o
<Glacymr> 12what's on the other 2?
<drf|laptop> 03one is Office Communicator, it's like a thing where you can edit Office documents online with other people or something
<drf|laptop> 03and the other is uh
<drf|laptop> 03Business Contact Manager
<Glacymr> 12yeah XD
<drf|laptop> 03it's a whole 5MB, don't know why it's on its own disc LOL
<RobotPinkie> Je ne suis pas frenchy froggy froggy frenchy
<Glacymr> 12all i need is excel and word
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<drf|laptop> 03what OS are you using?
<Ziltoid> froogy diggy dig hole plot
<Glacymr> 12windows 7, 64 bit
<Ziltoid> rofl
<Ziltoid> >milk tea
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<Dermathil> Tea with milk?
<Glacymr> 12i'd like it to work with my other laptop too though, vista 32 bit
<Ziltoid> wut
<drf|laptop> 03there's a 64-bit version of Office on there
<drf|laptop> 03well
*Insane_Lugia huggles Lightlugia
<drf|laptop> 03the disc has both 32 and 64 bit versions
<RobotPinkie> voulez vous coucher avec Twilight ce soir?
*Lightlugia urks
<drf|laptop> 03if you just do the autorun, it only installs 32-bit
<Dermathil> That is pretty good french you've got there. And a French Canadian's saying that.
<Glacymr> 12i see
<prince-dari> Oui
<drf|laptop> 03if you open up the disc and use the setup inside x64, that's the 64-bit one
<drf|laptop> 03up to you XD
<Dermathil> (he means Yes)
<Glacymr> 12well
<Ziltoid> OH YESAH?
<RobotPinkie> lolol I know
<Ziltoid> REALLY?
<Glacymr> 12i can install on both right?
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Dermathil> (:3)
<Glacymr> 1264 bit for one and 32 bit for the other
<RobotPinkie> I took French for 5000 years
<RobotPinkie> actually just one
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03on the 32-bit, just run the setup normally
<EdwardNewgate> OH YEAH, WELL I TOOK LATIN FOR 3
<EdwardNewgate> ...it was terrible
<drf|laptop> 03for the 64-bit, just open the disc and manually run it
<Glacymr> 12i wonder when 128 bit comes out
<prince-dari> I took Latin for 5.
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> Did it for GCSE.
<Ziltoid> I took latin for 7
<RobotPinkie> oh yeah well I learned English from a dictionary I found in a dumpster, beat THAT!
<Ziltoid> umad?
<prince-dari> You did it for A level?
<Glacymr> 12*dumb thought)
<Glacymr> 12*
<Ziltoid> YEAH
<Espeon> 06when Half Life: Episode 3 comes out
<prince-dari> Hah, I didn't pick it for A level.
<Espeon> 06oh wait
<RobotPinkie> NOM
<EdwardNewgate> BY JOVE
<Espeon> 06half life 2 obviously but the overuse pun still stands
<Ziltoid> that dude got tottally eated
<RobotPinkie> that looked delicious
<Kyu> 07o.o
<Insane_Lugia> lol
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espy|Touhou for 19 minutes
<drf|laptop> 03LOL 128-bit wouldn't even make sense
<drf|laptop> 03the reason they came out with 64-bit was that 32-bit had a limitation of about 3GB of RAM
<drf|laptop> 0364-bit lets you go up to like 2TB or something insane I think
<RobotPinkie> that wasn't very funny, Ben... not very funny at all
<Espeon> 062tb ram oh wow
<HyperMetalLugia> When Crysis 34 comes out
<Ziltoid> DERP
<Espeon> 06you had to pick the number 34
<Dermathil> HAHAHA
<HyperMetalLugia> Because it's all insane numbers
<EdwardNewgate> A lot
<Glacymr> 12i heard of some 32 bit thing with time though
<Glacymr> 12where in 2032 there makes some sort of loop
<Glacymr> 12http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem
<drf|laptop> 03ah yeah
<drf|laptop> 03that
<drf|laptop> 03That's a UNIX thing though
<drf|laptop> 03I think Windows XP and newer will be fine
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Xanbreon> 06Actually its more like 16 exabytes max for 64bit
<Glacymr> 12although if people are still using XP in 2038
<Glacymr> 12i'm going to be really worried
<drf|laptop> 03even better Xanbreon XD
<Xanbreon> 06But 256TB for AMD64
<RobotPinkie> trololololo
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<drf|laptop> 03what other 64-bit is there besides AMD64?
<EdwardNewgate> There is no fucking WAY I would go into that water
<drf|laptop> 03don't say Itanium lul
<Xanbreon> 06aka what we call x64 due to a 48bit virtual mem address
<Dman> Back guys, and bro, can't chat now sorry (skype), also IT IS ON in silverrp
<prince-dari> Oh God.
<prince-dari> It's always on.
<Dman> and also Robotpinkie - if I took out RD better would you upscale it again please?
<Lightlugia> 06IUGHFHSBIEUF
<Lightlugia> 06O.o
<Dman> cuz current one is a little whitepixely on the edges : /
<Xanbreon> 06Something with a 64bit virtual mem address
<drf|laptop> 03Glacymr, do you want the serial now or later?
<Dman> still, v0.2 is awesome
<Lightlugia> 06saw a hitler pikachu avatar on TF2

<Glacymr> 12later
<Dman> but v0.3 is needed
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<Ziltoid> Nice
<RobotPinkie> Myeah that's probably because of removing transparency and adding it back
<EdwardNewgate> Thank god you decided to show whole ep
<Dman> It is literally just some blurry / white pixels on the edgecuz i failed

<Dermathil> Actually, this show reminds me of a show I got where I live.
<Dermathil> (a family of 5, the husband, the wife, the 16-17yo teenage, the 13-14yo and the 9-10 kid.)
<Dermathil> *9-10yo kid.)

<prince-dari> Middle school? O_o
<Pegacorn> THIS IS LAME.
<RobotPinkie> CULTURE SHOCK
<ValtheJean> so elementary school (usually) is grades 1-5
<ValtheJean> Middle School (usually) is grades 6-8
<ValtheJean> sometimes 9
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Anyway, TV Tropes just made me learn that the distaff counterpart of 'senator' is 'senatrix'. In some regards.
<RobotPinkie> Haha
<ValtheJean> and then High School is the rest
<RinBarDosh> 10win
<prince-dari> Secondary school is the equivalent of high school.

<prince-dari> You're too young then Pegacorn.
<SilverMane> every villain is lemons
<prince-dari> To understand the humour of these children and the struggle of their parents.
<prince-dari> :P
<Pegacorn> I'm not too young,i'm just not british.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<ValtheJean> maybe it's because of my english roots, but I've always preferred british television to american
<prince-dari> It's nothing to do with being British.
<RinBarDosh> 10.. to be honest, it's hilariously british
<ValtheJean> well, anyone with a big family has gone through similar experiences
<Pegacorn> AHA!I GET IT NOW!IT'S BRILLIANT!

<ValtheJean> 0my theory is that there is no beating this game

<prince-dari> What counts as cheating?
<prince-dari> :P
<Dermathil> checking forums
<prince-dari> Pfft
<Dermathil> checking for the answer specifically
<Dermathil> except that, you can use pretty much anything.
<PokemonStar> 'dankes

<Skylands> 10Dang, I was about to write it down
<Dermathil> (you got a google bar. use it)
<Armageddon> xD
<Griggs> Caaz wouldn't
<prince-dari> "- All levels with a google bar potentially require googling. So use the built in google."
<MajinMew> just walk around the world
<prince-dari> Handy
<MajinMew> get a million people to write on a petition
<Armageddon> orly
<MajinMew> "griggs should cut off his own dick"
<Dermathil> (the entire page is used, not just the images. Look everywhere)
<Armageddon> he won't do it
<Skylands> 10Cut it off himself, a better idea
<Armageddon> he wouldn't be a sexpert without it
<Griggs> I enjoy using it too much
<prince-dari> Yeah, the title of the page hints at that.
<Griggs> That too
<prince-dari> <title>Look in the dark...</title>
<MajinMew> LET US TALK ABOUT MASTURBATION
<MajinMew> Armageddon, you first.
<EdwardNewgate> So basically, we know you're going to have to cheat because we made it so fucking hard, so to save you time, we put google so you don't have to change tabs to cheat?
<Armageddon> I don't sex myself ):
*Skylands leaves as the M word is spoken
*MajinMew sit down
<MajinMew> do others sex you?
<MajinMew> `-`
<Dermathil> EdwardNewgate, no
<Griggs> I did
<Dermathil> You CAN beat it without cheating.
<Griggs> Once or twice
<EdwardNewgate> Have you?
<Dermathil> You pretty much need to be a genius and know computers really wel.
<prince-dari> Well their custom google is SO useful.
<Dermathil> And no.
<prince-dari> That it doesn't even work.
<Dermathil> (and yeah I think their google is derp)
<EdwardNewgate> ...so most people will have to cheat
<prince-dari> So how do I search without all the answers coming up?
<Armageddon> might have been twice
<prince-dari> If their google doesn't work?
<Griggs> Actually I think 3 times
<prince-dari> And I'm not even sure whether that pokerstarts thing is an ad or a clue.
<Dermathil> it is an ad
<Dermathil> I don't even remember seeing that pokerstar stuff.

<EdwardNewgate> ...perhaps
<SilverMane> (not my fault that i'm so ship-worthy)
<GGgala> it doesn't make sense, though. it says to contact support@dinkypage.com, which means dinkypage was suspended by themselves?
<GGgala> if they were shut down by their isp it'd say a different email...
<Dakota> Hi! :D
<SilverMane> maybe they closed down while they deal with the email hack?
<Kosoveon> LL can only take so much soup before she pings o-o

<prince-dari> BTW is this an American chocolate bar?
<Chimera> 04mew
<prince-dari> Because if it is I'm unlikely ever to get it.
<HyperMetalLugia> I was just trying to add a dramatic effect :p
<Nittany_Tiger> I said two days ago, and no-one responded. Same for yesterday.
<Griggs> huh
<Griggs> what's a shame
<Barry> Hershey bars are usually made in Hershey, Pennsylvania
<EdwardNewgate> Honestly, that doesn't look like any wrapper I've ever seen
<Nittany_Tiger> I would normally brush it off, but I've had hard days.
<prince-dari> He went to the old school...
<prince-dari> I thought you were just joking.
<Nittany_Tiger> Not just a typical bad day, but hard "I want to go postal" days.
<prince-dari> No one's been ignoring you.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> The term 'used' in that sentence Griggs
<Barry> What does it mean, to go postal?
<Griggs> oh
<Griggs> wait
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, no-one been answering.

<Griggs> Man I'm slow tonight
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> haha
<Nittany_Tiger> Well, Friday, I went Flutterrage-ish when I refused to take a break off so I could finish work early. Didn't care what the bossman would do.
<prince-dari> He went to the old school...
<Nittany_Tiger> It turns out I earned an extra hour of overtime.
<Nittany_Tiger> But having 8 straight days of overtime work including weekends has pushed me very far.
<Glacymr> 12Light_Latias uses blue text
<Nittany_Tiger> I don't know how anyone normally would respond to working a lot, but many coworkers haven't responded well.
<Nittany_Tiger> And it's not a bad job.
<Kosoveon> Glacymr is a dragon named Glacymr
<Nittany_Tiger> It's just stressful.
<Nittany_Tiger> I just need a break here.

<Barry> Maybe they acknowledged you in other ways?
<Dermathil> alright
<EdwardNewgate> what was answer?
<prince-dari> I'm pretty sure I talked to you through my mic on the stream.
<Barry> but either way, not everyone responds to me
<Nittany_Tiger> Maybe.
<prince-dari> It was raider.
<Dermathil> Dari, we can't hear you

<prince-dari> Put backwards.
*Insane_Lugia slaps Glacymr around a bit with a large trout
<Barry> Whenever I say hello, I get maybe one or two responses. Three if I'm lucky
<prince-dari> In the URL bar.
<Nittany_Tiger> I wasn't on stream, so if you said hi, I didn't hear it.

<Glacymr> 12lol
<prince-dari> For username/password
<Kosoveon> um
<prince-dari> Something to do with a .GIF?
<ValtheJean> hmmm
<Dermathil> dragon?
<Kosoveon> I give up :P
<prince-dari> <!--GIF me my picture back-->
<Glacymr> 12see you don't know me so well :P
<Dermathil> what type of image are they?
<prince-dari> <bgsound src="../stuff/mus1.mp3" loop="infinite"><!-- switch pics for parallel view -->
<Dermathil> Are the 2 images in gifs?
<Kosoveon> I know you well enough to know you'd test me :P
<Kosoveon> so there
<ValtheJean> or if they were each named something else
<Glacymr> 12o-O
<ValtheJean> and only one of them was a gif
<Glacymr> 12heh
<prince-dari> Ahh
<Glacymr> 12not good enough
<prince-dari> I renamed the pic
<prince-dari> On the site.
<Dermathil> nice
<prince-dari> Changed the URL
<prince-dari> from jpg to gif
<Dermathil> awesome
<ValtheJean> ah
<ValtheJean> the difference between the two pics
<prince-dari> Hmm
<ValtheJean> the remote shakes
<Kosoveon> well Glacymr
<Kosoveon> if you know me so well
<ValtheJean> that's the only thing that actually changes
<Dermathil> yeah
<Kosoveon> what am I reading read now
<ValtheJean> everything else is perspective change
<Kosoveon> what book :P
<Dermathil> click the remote
<Glacymr> 12twilight
<Kosoveon> nope
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> Nothing.
<ValtheJean> hmmm
<Dermathil> Password: remote?
<Light_Latias> 12lol
<prince-dari> "attention whore"
<prince-dari> I suppose the remote
<prince-dari> Is the attention whore?
<prince-dari> Because it's moving around?
<Dermathil> makes sense
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Dermathil> it is trying to catch your attention
<ValtheJean> what are you using for the username?
<prince-dari> I tried both remote and gardner in either position.
<Dermathil> Hmmm.....
*Kosoveon throws a Pokemon Colosseum strategy guide at Light_Latias
<ValtheJean> are you sure gardner is one of them?
<prince-dari> Well the source code says to name what ruins the third dimension.
<prince-dari> Which is Gardner.
*Kosoveon also throws a Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness guide at Glacymr
<prince-dari> Maybe his cat's the attention whore?
<prince-dari> At the end of the video?
<ValtheJean> true
<ValtheJean> but what's the cat's name?
<ValtheJean> and then what's the point of the gif?
<prince-dari> Hmm
<prince-dari> I dunno.
<Glacymr> 12played it before
<Glacymr> 12i never purified my lugia
<Glacymr> 12XD
<ValtheJean> I wonder
<Glacymr> 12wasn't that i didn't want to
<ValtheJean> is there a remote in this vid at all?
<Glacymr> 12i just couldn't figure out how
<Glacymr> 12i knew it had something to do with that machine
<Dermathil> You seen that book in the box dari?
<Light_Latias> 12umm
<Kosoveon> fill it up with normal pokemon at the highest tempo or something
<prince-dari> ?
<Light_Latias> 12I finished Colosseum
<Dermathil> there's a box to the cat's left
<Light_Latias> 12and XD
<Light_Latias> 12the game XD that is
<Kosoveon> it's been a while since I played it and I never tried purifying shadow lugia
<Dermathil> with stuff written in it
<Glacymr> 12you know what i want to do one time
<prince-dari> Too hard to see what's in it.
<Kosoveon> :P
<Light_Latias> 12^
<Dermathil> ah
<ValtheJean> god damn gardner freaks me the fuck out
<Glacymr> 12no we should all do it if we have extra pokemon games XD
<ValtheJean> you're sure there's no audio?
*Light_Latias playing Metroid Prime again o.o
<Dermathil> controller?
<Glacymr> 12instead of using one of the normal starters we pick our own starter
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<Dermathil> instead of remote?
<Glacymr> 12i've considered it
<prince-dari> I'll try it.
<Dermathil> alright
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Dermathil> what?
<prince-dari> And the title of this page is stereo.
<ValtheJean> change it to remote maybe?
<Dermathil> Dari: what about mono?
<Dermathil> (stereo/mono)
<prince-dari> Hmm, still nope.
<prince-dari> The only clue we haven't used it: <bgsound src="../stuff/mus1.mp3" loop="infinite"><!-- switch pics for parallel view -->
<FreezeFrame> Newest chapter of Romancing Quest is.... Interesting.
<prince-dari> Other than stereo.
<Dermathil> wasn't mus1 for the other thing?
<prince-dari> Actually.
<prince-dari> Switch pics probably is a hint for changing jpg to gif
<prince-dari> Ohh.
<prince-dari> The gif.
<prince-dari> It's just the two images on the page put one after the other.
<Dermathil> yeah
<ValtheJean> ...
<ValtheJean> lol duh
<prince-dari> XD
<ValtheJean> also
<ValtheJean> the 12 movws
<ValtheJean> moves*
<Dermathil> yes
<prince-dari> Oh yeah.
<Dermathil> the number moves too
<ValtheJean> god damn gardner freaks me the fuck out
<Kosoveon> sounds interesting
<Barry> hello again
<ValtheJean> hello barry
<Dermathil> is that the same audio cue?
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<Dermathil> Gardner's ruining the 3rd dimension that's for sure...
<Dermathil> So Gardner's probably the username
<Barry> How are ya, Val
<ValtheJean> it's the attention whore we need to figure out
<ValtheJean> I'm good, how about you?
<Barry> I'm good
<Dermathil> remote controller? The composite word we haven't tried yet
<Barry> @finemeter
<Steven_Magnet> 6 You are 64% fine. (1475)
<ValtheJean> mfw it was just a case sensitive clue
<ValtheJean> god damn I hate case sensitive
<prince-dari> Oh wait.
<prince-dari> Maybe it's not Gardner ruining the third dimension?
<ValtheJean> then who is?
<prince-dari> Just the remote?
<ValtheJean> because gardner's face is all fucked up
<prince-dari> It's the only thing that moves.
<prince-dari> In the picture.
<ValtheJean> like watch the vid again
<ValtheJean> his face fucking deforms
<prince-dari> Becuase the remote moves it screws up 3d.
<prince-dari> Hmm
<prince-dari> That still leaves us just with remote though?
<ValtheJean> well, even if it's the remote that breaks the 3rd dimension
<ValtheJean> where do we input that info?
<ValtheJean> where do we go with that?
<prince-dari> Yeah, and the clue is "attention whore"
<prince-dari> It has to be the remote.
<Dermathil> Remote?
<ValtheJean> maybe just controller?
<ValtheJean> instead of remote controller
<prince-dari> Ahh, good point.
<prince-dari> remote for one
<prince-dari> controller for the other
<prince-dari> Hmm
<prince-dari> Nope
<prince-dari> Maybe remote and control?
<prince-dari> WINNING!
<prince-dari> Number 13.
<prince-dari> Oook.
<prince-dari> Next page.
<prince-dari> "no maths
<prince-dari> "
<prince-dari> Dialog pops up

<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Dermathil> check all the numbers
<Nittany_Tiger> Last day of work tomorrow. No more painting job after that. Wish me luck bronies.
<prince-dari> Ohh.
<Nittany_Tiger> Because I'm close to insane.
<Dermathil> see on the wall?

<HyperMetalLugia> Chimera wants to breed?
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o

<Light_Latias> 12...?
<Light_Latias> 12Chimera?
<FreezeFrame> It's not due to "this goes against my OTP", but due to "Where the fuck did this sudden stupid shit come from?"

<HyperMetalLugia> Oh

<Dermathil> you are way more patient than I am, Dari.
<FreezeFrame> I don't normally spoil, but this deserves warning. It adds sudden Molestia.
<Dermathil> You are also way better than I was.
<Dermathil> Anyhow, I'll have to take my leave, 00:14 where I live. And I'd rather get some sleep than collapse in a few hours and be like 1 week in bed.

<Rodman> Dem fitting jeans!
<Razyn> Half pair. Jean
<ValtheJean> so
<ValtheJean> much
<ValtheJean> rage
<Rodman> Cut-off jeans
<Razyn> Low cut Vals
<ValtheJean> at times :P
<Rodman> Hey, so did Dman finish the video he and Pinkie were working at last night?
<Razyn> And acid from the eighties
<Rodman> Ok
<ValtheJean> bow chicka bow wow
<ValtheJean> TALLY HO!
*Razyn is glad he can't picture dari
<ValtheJean> if it didn't physically hurt me every time you played it, I'd suggest continuing that game just to keep insulting it
<ValtheJean> also I want to see Durrgurr die :P
<Rodman> Remember Homer, its like I'm wearing nothing at all! Nothing at all!
<SilverMane> Mardek RPG: Chapter 2!
<ValtheJean> I WANT TO SEE HIM DIE AGAIN
<SilverMane> Play It!
<ValtheJean> I WANT TO SEE A SKELETON STAB HIM IN THE GIZZARD
<Razyn> Nothing at all. That's why.
<ValtheJean> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<SilverMane> in the gizzard?
<ValtheJean> oh god! LOOK WHAT YOU DID DARI
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 5Kakuna.
<ValtheJean> YOU MADE BALDUR'S GATE 2 CRASH
<ValtheJean> yeah, you get that name right you whore
<Razyn> Rah-zin.
<ValtheJean> with its shrill Harpy's call of death :P
<Razyn> ...
<Razyn> Ruh-zin
<Rodman> Raisin?
<ValtheJean> I always pronounced it raisin
<Razyn> stress the zin
<Rodman> It also tastes like raisins
*Razyn facehoofs

<Razyn> YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES
<Armageddon> ohai Quilava and Temeraki
<Armageddon> and wb LL
<Temeraki> Goodnight Armageddon
<Temeraki> How are you this glorious evening?
<SilverMane> ValtheJean, chapter 2 and 3 are full-blown RPG-ness. ala 16-bit final fantasy, but still
<ValtheJean> you silly brits :P
<Armageddon> I'm fine, you?
<Razyn> I'm still trying to figure out how to explain how to pronounce it online.
<ValtheJean> omg...if someone could shop a pony for this guys face
<ValtheJean> I would be so fucking happey
<ValtheJean> http://images.wikia.com/forgottenrealms/images/3/32/Ajantis.jpg

<ValtheJean> with an e
<SilverMane> hmm...
<SilverMane> i see Twilight in him
<ValtheJean> he is a paladin :P
<ValtheJean> and the pants were dead
<SilverMane> also, Baldur's Gate 1: Why the fuck do they let a level 5 wizard attack my level 1 party, starting off combat with Magic Missile, instantly dealing 3d4+3 damage to a party member?
<Rodman> And the sun and the birds were almost down from the top of the sky.
<ValtheJean> where exactly did this happen?
<ValtheJean> because Baldur's gate was completely open ended
<Razyn> Damn, you should narrate
<SilverMane> umm, you leave the starting town, go through the woods towards the East, and it's right outside a building in the next area
<ValtheJean> it means:
<ValtheJean> you roll 3 four sided dice
<ValtheJean> add them up
<ValtheJean> then add 3
<Rodman> Remember kids
<ValtheJean> yeah, that's because you wandered into a higher level area
<Rodman> When bullets hit you, you don't die
<SilverMane> but, it was a town
<ValtheJean> instead of listening to what gorion told you
<Rodman> Numbers come out and THEY KILL YOU!
<SilverMane> and i didn't even have a map
<SilverMane> and he just fucking attacked me because i was me
<SilverMane> and I was like 'I'm a wizard with 4 hp, screw this shit'
<ValtheJean> I make no apologies for someone who doesn't save his game
<ValtheJean> nor listens to the plot
<Armageddon> :p
<ValtheJean> people call jpgs j-pegs, so that's fine with me :P
<Temeraki> Yes yes
<Temeraki> I saw cowboys and aliens

<Glacymr> 12too much effort to type in names these days D
<ValtheJean> oh good
<ValtheJean> so we're agreed
<ValtheJean> good night :P
<Drake> 04Honestly, I find using Tab annoying
<Drake> 04It's easier to type names
<NightSeas> 12Hi Bree :3
<Glacymr> 12tab can sometimes create great humor though
<Drake> 04Such as calling me Draelen 9/10 times
<Glacymr> 12darnit there isn't anyone else on this channel whose name starts with an N besides NightSeas XD
<Drake> 04DARNIT THIS TEA NEEDS MOAR SUGAR
<Dashite> Rainbow Dash is best pony and Cara-Mac is canon.
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Polarfire> lol.
<NightSeas> 12!Glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to NightSeas for 18 minutes and has to fly NightSeas around until then
<Glacymr> 12no go own someone else like Drake D:
<Glacymr> !nightseas
*NightSeas puts leash on Glacymr and avoids ownership.
<Drake> 04XD
<Polarfire> lol, you know what I realized?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Nnng
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I dunno whether to upload this picture to dA or not
<Drake> 04Heya Shiny
<drf|laptop> 03nobody should ever upload anything to dA
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey Lyon
<Glacymr> 12drf i agree with you that da is a bit nuts at times but why boycott them drf?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Well, I do, so...hi, my name's Nobody.
<Drake> 04XD
*Drake pets Shiny
*Shiny-Growlithe sprawls out under Lyon
*Drake has a Shiny-Growlithe underneath him
<Polarfire> Well, for one thing I'm all alone.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hmm hmm hmm
<Dashite> Nope
<Polarfire> ohai
<Polarfire> anyway
<Polarfire> there are no mibbitfoals left.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Manly's on :D
<Drake> 04Hey Shiny
<Dashite> Huh, you're right.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Was ;v;
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yeah?
<Drake> 04May I ask why Manly deleted his profile on TST?
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02He said all the friends he talks to are on the other sites he goes to. So no point in having TST anymore.
<Drake> 04Fair enough
<drf|laptop> 03<Glacymr> drf i agree with you that da is a bit nuts at times but why boycott them drf? <- because someone has to?
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Glacymr> 12what else do you boycott?
<Drake> 04dA has some weird people on it, I agree.
<Drake> 04But still
<Drake> 04That's a bit...extreme
*Shiny-Growlithe suddenly thinks of Haii
<Drake> 04...
<Drake> 04On second thought
*Drake shot
<drf|laptop> 03because dA never even works
<drf|laptop> 03Look at real artists like Articuno, they have their own galleries
<drf|laptop> 03hosted professionaly
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Glacymr> 12arti also has a DA as well though
<drf|laptop> 03I know
<drf|laptop> 03for the n00bs who can't find her site
<Freyskol> eww da
<Drake> 04dA is more for non-professionals who just like to show off *coughmecough*
<drf|laptop> 03^
<Drake> 04But eh.
<Drake> 04What are you gonna do about it? It's frackin' huge.
<Drake> 04As another question: Do solo writers usually have their own sites as well?
<drf|laptop> 03nothing, I just stopped using it
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Rip on everyone who uses it lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Of course Lyon :P
<drf|laptop> 03depends on the person Drake
<Drake> 04Ok cool
<Drake> 04And what do you mean drf?
<drf|laptop> 03depends on how technically knowledgable they are
<drf|laptop> 03some random n00b who writes fanfiction isn't going to know how to make a site
<HyperMetalLugia> Like Haii?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;.;p
<drf|laptop> 03but someone who does know how to probably will if they want enough people to read it
<drf|laptop> 03it's like comic series
<drf|laptop> 03the few I do follow
<drf|laptop> 03like Xkcd
<drf|laptop> 03they all have their own sites, not dA :P
<Drake> 04Hmm
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, dA is basically just for people to show off
<drf|laptop> 03and I prefer to ;show off by having my own site so
*drf|laptop hides
<Drake> 04Well, I'm interested in web design (not that I'm exceedingly good at it lol) and I was thinking that if I ever get a story started I might make a website or something for the story as practice in web design
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04'Course, I'd have to practice HTML and stuff first
<Drake> 04All I know is the basics
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02All that shizz
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<drf|laptop> 03see
<drf|laptop> 03I don't even know HTML
<drf|laptop> 03I just use FrontPage
<drf|laptop> 03which is like DreamWeaver but not Adobe XD
<Drake> 04FrontPage?
<Drake> 04Oh
<drf|laptop> 03Microsoft's version of Dreamweaver
<Drake> 04We used Dreamweaver
<drf|laptop> 03the new name is Expression Werb
<drf|laptop> 03*Web
<drf|laptop> 03but eh
<Drake> 04Which I still have on my laptop
<drf|laptop> 03well basically you use it like Word
<drf|laptop> 03you can just do it graphically
<Drake> 04I (sorta) made a website but it's crap
<drf|laptop> 03and it does the coding for you
<Drake> 04Oh cool
<drf|laptop> 03hey my website is crap too
<drf|laptop> 03I mainly just serve files on it :P
<Drake> 04But still, I think you ought to know a bit of coding
<Drake> 04XD
<drf|laptop> 03well I';m lazy
<drf|laptop> 03so yeah
<Polarfire> I hear movement
<Drake> 04XD
<Dashite> You hear nothing.
<Dashite> Except the grue.
<Drake> 04FrontPage...Do you have to pay for it?
<Polarfire> I think he just rolled over.
<drf|laptop> 03technically
<drf|laptop> 03but LOL PIRACY
*Shiny-Growlithe gives drf a pirate hat
*Glacymr gives drf a bottle of rum
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03EW ALCOHOL but yeah
<Glacymr> 12look at it this way
<Glacymr> 12alcohol makes great fires :)
<drf|laptop> 03pure alcohol does
<drf|laptop> 03but if it's watered down, probably not
<Glacymr> 12dunno

<Drake> 04I'd almost finished the summary for DoI (which is now 15000 words btw), before realising the final confrontaion made no sense and had to go back and add a completely new side-plot

<Ascendant> Have fun, Drake :p
<Ascendant> But seriously, anything close to Defeat's length is going to suck
<Ascendant> nothing should ever be Defeat's length
<Ascendant> and Defeat sucks anyway
<Drake> 04This isn't a chapter, it's just a summary so I think it'll be fine
<lightumbreon> 06http://light-umbreon.deviantart.com/#/d46urcw < FYI, finnaly uploaded it to a PROPER place :P

<Drake> 04I'm surprised he didn't get kicked
<Insane_Lugia> neither is degradeing others by calling them noob
<drf|away> 03it's not degrading if it's the truth
<Drake> 04Insane_Lugia, if you swear at others your argument basically becomes invalid
<Insane_Lugia> wel when drf starts it how do you expect someone to react?
<Drake> 04/fact of life
<drf|away> 03^
<drf|away> 03Insane_Lugia, just ignore it

<Ascendant> I love my scripts
<Drake> 04Minnet, awesome
<Minnet> Excuse me?
<Drake> 04That was just awesome
<Ascendant> Minnet is a bot lol
<Drake> 04oh
<Ascendant> Insane_Lugia
<Drake> 04Could've told me earlier damnit
<Ascendant> That was unnecessary
<Insane_Lugia> hmm?
<Ascendant> drf only corrected what you said
<Ascendant> He didn't attack you
<Drake> 04Also swearing = Big no in this community. At least, insulting swearing
<Insane_Lugia> sorry, so is standing by and watch him degrade others. ive seen enough.
<Ascendant> Insane_Lugia, he doesn't degrade others
<Ascendant> Ever heard of "joking"?
<Insane_Lugia> theres other ways to joke with out putting others down for swotwear they use et
<Insane_Lugia> etc
<Insane_Lugia> and from what ive been told im not first to complaina bout him
<drf|away> 03wow, someone's new here and already my haters are trying to convince new members to hate me?
<drf|away> 03I'm impressed, actually.
<Drake> 04drf is a fact of life
<Ascendant> Insane_Lugia, there is a different between being influenced by others and making your own decisions
<Ascendant> I suggest you do the latter
<drf|away> 03^
<Insane_Lugia> i dont hate you love you as a friend as i do everyone else <3
<drf|away> 03that sentence made no sense
<Drake> 04There's really nothing you can- what
<drf|away> 03and yes I know I said I was going to bed
<drf|away> 03I'm just watching how this unfolds as it's quite funny XD
<Ascendant> Even if you think drf was wrong and what he said was silly or degrading, you don't attack him back, Insane_Lugia
<Espeon> 06Sounds somewhat like me. I like everyone until they've made themselves deserve otherwise :P
<drf|away> 03and people who hate me over one comment, I mean LOL WUT
<Drake> 04Insane_Lugia, you've just made yourself look bad by attacking him. The end.
<drf|away> 03plus I was being literal, Insane_Lugia is a newbie to the chat, hence n00b
<drf|away> 03:P
<Insane_Lugia> dont matter, fact is ive only been around for few weeks if that. hes been around longer there for naturally people has his side. just how it works.
<Espeon> 06and lets just say drf and his jokes are and have always been somewhat controversial, best thing to do is just assume everything negative he says is not serious
*Drake goes and gets dinner now
<Ascendant> noob != newbie
<Espeon> 06and Nah, n00bs implies someone who
<Drake> 04wat
<Ascendant> anyway
<drf|away> 03no?
<drf|away> 03Half this channel doesn't like me LOL
<Espeon> 06refuses to learn
<Drake> 04what
<Drake> 04WHAT
<Espeon> 06and what
<Drake> 04I do NOT have his side.
<Ascendant> And Insane_Lugia, don't assume things

<Glacymr> 12yugioh is considered an awesome series
<Glacymr> 12XD
<Glacymr> 12their games

<Glacymr> 12are based on video games because they have holograms in the series
<Dman> So how are ya robotpinkie?
<Dman> How you doin valthejean?

<ValtheJean> I'm not too bad myself

<RobotPinkie> Well, I got Fluttershy and Applejack, so that's awesome :P How u, Dman?
<ValtheJean> I leave for college next tuesday, which means this friday is my last work day :D
<ctr> that was years ago though

<ValtheJean> plus (ironically) being at college means I'll actually have time to do pony related things
<Glacymr> 12like the spinoffs
<RobotPinkie> It IS 3000 x something, though?
<Glacymr> 12pokemon is such a better card game though
<Dman> I requested 4000 x something last time:P silly me
<RobotPinkie> or do you mean 3000 in height?
<Ziltoid> So who made that RD vector with the zoom in and the sexyness and things?
<Dman> 3000 across :)

<Dermathil> I'm still in the first half of the game though.
<ValtheJean> inwaylatebutohwell howdy Dermathil
<Dermathil> ohai Val
<Dermathil> ever played STALKER, Val?
<ValtheJean> very briefly, yes
<Dermathil> did you like it?
<Cynder7> 6Hey..Sry but I can't stay.. >.<
<ValtheJean> eh....not really
<ValtheJean> it probably didn't help that my friend was talking it up like crazy
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> :(
<ValtheJean> he always complained my games weren't realistic enough
<Glacymr> 12what the heck are you playing
<ValtheJean> and when I finally asked him for an example of a realistic game, he gave me Stalker
<Dermathil> Was it the visuals (textures, models, lighting, etc) that you didn't like?
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> You may not want to see him... mzybe... if you have the guts...
<RobotPinkie> Really?
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> *maybe
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<ValtheJean> it was mostly the frustration with the combat system
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> Do you wish to see him...
<Pattyrick> I'm playing Stunt Biker
<Dermathil> (Stalker's REALLY realistic. Gunfights are very fluids when you get the hang of it0
<ValtheJean> the fact that I could sneak/shoot better than my character was frustrating
<ValtheJean> eh, I disagree on the realism
<ValtheJean> it's a game like anything else
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> This is all I have... may he frolic in paradise, and puppy heaven... :'(
<Dermathil> Val, the accuracy of your guns was probably due to the fact that the guns themselves were horribly shitty.
<Cynder7> 6What? o.o
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> F*CK... I miss him sooo much...
*Light_Latias playing Beyond Good and Evil (the demo, anyway)
<ValtheJean> yes, he used that same excuse too
<Glacymr> 12i was t alking to Espeon XD
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> He's gone c7...
<Dermathil> The guns in the beginning of the game are very inaccurate due to being, well, entry-level guns
<Cynder7> 6Who? What happened?
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> Gone...
<ValtheJean> of which I replied that I've fired FAR shittier weapons in real life
<ValtheJean> with much higher accuracy
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> pup-pup, bo, our bulldog...
<Cynder7> 6DD:
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> :'(
<Cynder7> 6I'm really sorry..
<RobotPinkie> Not sure I'd say it's realistic just because it has crap guns...
<Dermathil> I can tell you something. I originally didn't like the game either.
<Cynder7> 6Sry,gtg >.<
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> And this is all I have left of him... http://ayumi-wolf-dragon.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=scraps#/d46vwx6
<{D1ST0RT10N-xViiruZz}> :(
<Dermathil> I hated the graphics and the accuracy too.
<ValtheJean> the graphics don't bother me
<Ziltoid> dem russian games
<ValtheJean> graphics are just fluff to me, they're nice when they're good, but they can't ruin a game for me
<Dermathil> But I was recommended to download I think it was STALKER: Complete 2009. Graphics get a HUUUUUUUUUGE graphical upgrade
<Dermathil> And I began liking the game more in general.
<Dermathil> Name changes for some of the guns so they are named after their real-life counterparts, and tons of stuff.
<Dermathil> It is also easier to see your enemies with that.
<ValtheJean> meh
<Dermathil> 1/3 of every stalker player downloaded it
<ValtheJean> if a game is only good if you download a mod, that speaks very poorly for the game
<Barry> @pony Barry's drinking buddy
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Barry's drinking buddy is 12Soar1in'
<Light_Latias> 12she even has a ROLLING ATTACK o-o;
<ValtheJean> mods should compliment an already good game, not make it
<Dermathil> Val, that's because the game was released in 2006.
<Dermathil> And it really didn't age well.
<Barry> at least I got a pony who's old enough to drink
*SilverSonic still hasnt gotten past Fire Temple on OoT >>;
<Sathi> 7Val when are you getting left4? :)
*SilverSonic hasn't played OoT in a while :p
<Light_Latias> 12Heart health system
<ValtheJean> I play plenty of old games without mod upgrades
<Light_Latias> 12a camera
<Barry> Left for question mark?
<ValtheJean> Sathi: Whenever it goes on sale :P
<Light_Latias> 12wtf am I playing o-o
<Dermathil> The story for STALKER is incredibly good btw.
<Light_Latias> 12a spin attack
*Light_Latias dnhbafniewcskmxoew
<ValtheJean> I've heard as much
<Light_Latias> 12I'm playing the 360 version of LoZ
<SilverSonic> LOL
<Barry> never heard of that game. I've heard of Left 4 Dead, but not Left 4 Question Mark
<RobotPinkie> if I get a L4D game, should I get the first or the second?
<Anth-Umbreon> o.O
<ValtheJean> but the gameplay bothers me so much I just have no interest continuing it
<ValtheJean> second I would say
<ValtheJean> considering it has everything from the first
<Sathi> 7second
<Dermathil> I'd suggest playing a little longer. You should get the hang of the fighting pretty quickly.
<Light_Latias> 12she even has a 4-letter name o-x
<Anth-Umbreon> and Im playing the Wii version of Halo
<Barry> @pony Princess Peach's alias
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Princess Peach's alias is 7Mr Br15eezy
<Light_Latias> 12ew
<Light_Latias> 12wat is?
<Barry> it's magic
<ValtheJean> but why force myself to play a game I hate?
<ValtheJean> I made that mistake with FF13
<ctr> i'm playing gran turismo on my megadrive
<ValtheJean> and I've only regretted it
<Light_Latias> 12lol
<Dermathil> I can understand for FF13.
<RobotPinkie> Might get that soon, then
<Dermathil> But what I say is that I find STALKER far superior to Fallout 3 and New Vegas, for example.
<ValtheJean> well, I've never been a fan of Fallout
<ctr> also
<Dermathil> (can you shoot the lights out in Fallout?)
<ctr> anyone heard of "nanashi no game"
<ctr> that game is being fantranslated right now
<Dermathil> (also, the underground complexes/dungeons are insanely well designed.)
<RobotPinkie> So therefore Splinter Cell on the PS2 is superior to Fallout 3! :P
<ValtheJean> lol
<Barry> Let's try one more
<Barry> @pony Princess Zelda's Alias
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Princess Zelda's Alias is 8Apple Bl4oom
<Pattyrick> Mmmmm Gran Turismo
<RobotPinkie> lol I like Fallout 3. I mean it has some serious flaws, but I like having a massive open world
<ValtheJean> ahhh just played Baldur's Gate 2 again last night...hardcore nostalgia right there
<Pattyrick> Imma racing game kind of person
<CrossBreeze> Afternoon.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Hey Cross
<RobotPinkie> >yfw I played Baldur's Gate for the first time in 5 years two days ago
<Light_Latias> 12aaaand demo done
<ctr> i gave up on the series after the fourth game tough
<ValtheJean> orly?
<prince-dari> Hello.
<ValtheJean> actual Baldur's Gate or shitty ps2 Baldur's Gate?
<Sathi> Hello.
<SirSprinkles> 6Okay, CrossBreeze, I'm just going to ask you a series of questions for the first part of the interview and I want you to answer them to the best of your ability.
<CrossBreeze> Can do.
<ctr> polyphony can't keep deadlines
<RobotPinkie> Yup, gonna make may through that and the expansion, then it's BG2 and its expansion
<Hipster_Brony> btw sprinkles, heres the cupcakes pic: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/src/130115591169.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> dunno if you have the others
<RobotPinkie> lol nowai, PC game Baldur's Gate
<ValtheJean> good :P
<ValtheJean> what class you playing?
<Light_Latias> 12oh nooooo...
<RobotPinkie> Paladin
<Pattyrick> GT5 is pretty good
<ValtheJean> lol, nowai! I'm playing a Pally for like, the first time this run through
<RobotPinkie> I never do normally, but eh
<Pattyrick> But yeah, that should've come out 2 years ago instead of last November
<RobotPinkie> haha
<Sathi> ..eww..
<prince-dari> Lulz
<SirSprinkles> 6So you haven't attended any Brony Movie Nights, correct?
<ValtheJean> I had to force myself to not pick a mage or thief
<Hipster_Brony> ...yeah
<prince-dari> The eyeball makes that picture. :P
<RobotPinkie> I've never played through an infinity engine game with a paladin before :P
<Hipster_Brony> No
<Hipster_Brony> nothing makes that picture
<ValtheJean> oh
<nickstr> what about Duke Nukem Forever
<Hipster_Brony> it is bad and the artist should feel bad
<ValtheJean> you should download that BG1 mod that lets you pick BG2 classes and such
<SilverSonic> oh god that game
<nickstr> that one has been vaporware for well over a decade
<ValtheJean> because you'll want to be one of the specialized paladins
<RobotPinkie> I didn't know there was such a thing
<prince-dari> I just find it funny.
*Light_Latias sighs
<ValtheJean> yeah
<Light_Latias> 12brb x.x
<nickstr> and it only JUST NOW was released
<ValtheJean> can't remember the name
<SilverSonic> kk
*prince-dari is twisted. :P
<ctr> but the difference is
<SilverSonic> the ending to DNF is crap
<ValtheJean> but it basically makes importing BG1 characters into BG2 SO much easier
<RobotPinkie> lol I dunno, I'm gonna start from scratch after Tales of the Sword Coast
<ValtheJean> ah
<ctr> while the ending to GT5 has lots of car porn
<ValtheJean> well then in that case forget it :P
<RobotPinkie> like once I hit BG2, I'm gonna make a new character
<ctr> (if you get that)
<nickstr> not me
<RobotPinkie> ...unless I rly like the Paladin, but I doubt it :P
<nickstr> even though I am working on car stereos
<ValtheJean> yeah...paladin's in BG1 were kind of sucky
<CrossBreeze> Uh, incorrect. I've been to three, last my count. I watched one of them in a while ago, and I've visited the two of them of late, though I must admit my experience with them is far less than I would like. the
<prince-dari> You guys with your r-pegs.
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> plus you could recruit Ajantis
<Dman> Ohai dari
<ValtheJean> and he was fucking ballin
<nickstr> I have one out of a 1959 Chevy on the work bench now
<RobotPinkie> ohai dari
<prince-dari> Hey.
<ValtheJean> oh look! it's that whore dari!
<Dman> Dari robotpinkie made a better RD
<Barry> Hello, again Dari
<Hipster_Brony> oh yeah, cross is a writer, so he might do some textwalls
<RobotPinkie> lol I missed a bit, Dman
<Hipster_Brony> just a heads up
*Shadow_Lugia 6nostalgically noms Nick.
<prince-dari> Yay.
<prince-dari> :P
<SirSprinkles> I thought he hadn't been to... oh whatever.
<Dermathil> dari, ever played Stalker?
<RobotPinkie> Mind getting a new one? virtually identical, just fixed some white pixels
<ValtheJean> is it me, or does there seem to be an unusual amount of mods online right now?
<nickstr> I have just about found the problem too
<SilverSonic> ohai Shadow_Lugia :3
<ValtheJean> ...
<ValtheJean> wait..
<ValtheJean> IT'S A TRAP
<Hipster_Brony> hes been to a few, but he doesnt talk much during them
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hey, Silver!
*ValtheJean hides
<nickstr> the classic case of dried out and bad electrolytic capacitors
<RobotPinkie> OHSHI-
<prince-dari> He's been to 3...?
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<SilverSonic> How are you today :)
<Dman> You missed a bit? robotpinkie?
<RobotPinkie> It's an intervention
<Dman> Sure man doo eet
<SirSprinkles> 6Why were you late to the two?
<Dermathil> ( :O ) >mfw http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112364-Notch-Challenges-Bethesda-to-Lawsuit-Deathmatch
<ValtheJean> hah
<Dman> also robotpinkie - found a way to make any pic work with vegas pro
<Hipster_Brony> 8>of late
<nickstr> its heavy too all steel construction
<ValtheJean> I hope they accept
<prince-dari> No I haven't Dermathil.
<Dman> so it's literally GET, stickinvegaspro, RENDER =]
<ValtheJean> that whole lawsuit thing is so stupid
<Hipster_Brony> 8aka recently :D
<nickstr> drop that thing on a more modern device and you would likely break it
<SirSprinkles> 6>inability to read
<prince-dari> Sprinkles. Fail. :P
<nickstr> well the modern device that is
<Hipster_Brony> 8lolololo
<Dman> LAWSUIT DEATHMATCH!
<SirSprinkles> 6Nevermind that then.
<Hipster_Brony> 8anyway, back to the interview
<Dermathil> ValtheJean: I know. But that specific lawsuit is pretty much like free popcorn entertainment.
<nickstr> that 52 year old tank would survive without a problem
<ValtheJean> pretty much
<SirSprinkles> ...I was distracted by german chocolate.
<SirSprinkles> ...from Germany.
<RobotPinkie> Dman http://i.imgur.com/sapsa.gif
<Dermathil> They want to settle the lawsuit over a game of Quake 3 Deathmatch.
<ValtheJean> it's just so stupid that it even exists
<SirSprinkles> 6What is your availability for moderating?
<Dermathil> go tell that to the Bethesda lawyers.
<RobotPinkie> Almost identical, just... shouldn't have any white lines at the edges at all
<Dman> ty robotpinkie
<Dman> i'm going to dinner now, but will do eet =] when i get back from idnner
<RobotPinkie> Alright, later Dman
<Dman> hey staying on pc
<Dman> just can't do anything
<Dman> other than chat :D
<Dashite> Bethesda will never go for it, but it would be awesome.
<Hipster_Brony> nice
<CrossBreeze> My availability is quite flexible. I'm self-employed and live by myself, so I can set my own hours without any problems. I'd say my availability is whenever you need me for; I can just move my schedule around to accomodate.
<Hipster_Brony> also, that last question was straight off the application :/
<Hipster_Brony> fuck you emoticon
<Hipster_Brony> : /
<RobotPinkie> lol oh okay
<Dman> =]
<RobotPinkie> and I'd love to see that deathmatch
<SirSprinkles> 6Do you have any experience moderating?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Busy-ish. *late*
<RobotPinkie> Team Mojang are pretty hardcore
<SirSprinkles> I totally care.
<Dermathil> yeah, I hope that deathmatch if it goes down gets livestreamed or filmed by MLG
<Dermathil> that'd be awesome.
<Dashite> Would Bethesda be allowed to pull in ringers from id or just the Elder Scrolls team?
<ValtheJean> dunno
<Dermathil> I got no idea.
<prince-dari> And I thought Bethesda was pretty cool, well Mojang is awesome.
<ValtheJean> he wasn't very clear on the challenge
<Hipster_Brony> well, it's a little redundant to ask questions that we already have answered on the application, dont you think?
<Dermathil> I'd think they'd be allowed to take ringers from ID
<Dman> DERMATHIL! BRO!
<ValtheJean> I think it was basically just a way of saying "look, this whole thing is stupid, can we just have fun and get on with it?"

<Dermathil> Valthejean, that's exactly what it is.
<CrossBreeze> Regrettably, no, I can not claim any experience in moderating, though I do feel up to the task. But to answer your question, no, I do not.
*Dermathil brohoofs Dman.
*Dman brohoofs Dermathil
<SirSprinkles> 6What talents do you bring to the table?
<Dashite> Based on what was said, I would think they could pull guys in from id, on the other hand, the id guys have no real stake in this matter so obviously it should be the Elder Scrolls team that has to defend their own honour. :p
<Sathi> bah damn you chrome update... can someone link the interview channel?
<SirSprinkles> Just a little. I'm just c/p'ing... I've had no sleep so I'm not horribly attentive to WHAT I'm c/p'ing...
<SirSprinkles> #bronystateinterviews
<Dman> I'd still like to see one :P
<Dermathil> yeah, that'd probably what the ID team would tell em.
<Hipster_Brony> 8in other words, what can you do that would set you apart from other applicants
<Hipster_Brony> 8?
<Sathi> thank you
<Dermathil> yeah, same.
<RobotPinkie> Myeah
<Hipster_Brony> good thing that slash is there
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Hipster_Brony> i would hate for you to be CP-ing XD
<RobotPinkie> Oh man, it's really too bad it probably won't happen.
<prince-dari> INB4 wall of text response
<RobotPinkie> Lawyers don't allow that kind of shenanigans :P
<Hipster_Brony> like i said, he tends to text wall sometimes XD
<Light_Latias> 12yays

<Glacymr> 12lol
<Light_Latias> 12irony oxo
<CrossBreeze> Well, I suppose if we're talking personally, I can say that I can remain level headed and objective in the face of stress, spamming, trolls, and what have you. I work well in teams, and I do my best to communicate in a respectful but firm manner. To be blunt, I believe I have what to takes to effectively and professionally handle situations as they arise.
<ValtheJean> I love browsing the DMC forums on Gamespot
<Barry> Hi, Sathi
<ValtheJean> it's hillarious to read people flame about a game that doesn't even exist
<CrossBreeze> Do you need anything specific?
<Dman> =]
<Sathi> Hello again
<Dashite> Bastards. Bethesda doesn't allow any discussion of this issue on their forum.

<CrossBreeze> Well, let's see. The BMN is already on EqD and Ponychan, and those are the two biggest sites the community has, so I'm not sure there's much more you can do in the realm of advertising. Also,
<ValtheJean> WHO'S A GOOPY GOOBER YEAH!
<RobotPinkie> plz stream hot hot RD clopvids for us
*Dman is a silly pony
<prince-dari> Also, hey Polarfire. <3
<Polarfire> ohai everyone
<Polarfire> Dari
<Dman> Oh, IM a goofy goober YEA
<Dman> YOU'RE A goofy goober YEA
<RainBroDash> 10ohai Polarfire >:3
<Dman> WERE ALL GOOFY GOOBERS YEA
<RobotPinkie> ohai Polarfire
<Polarfire> you streamed yourself sleeping.
<Ziltoid> hello polarfire
<Dman> goofy goofy goober goober YEAAAAA
<ValtheJean> oh
<ValtheJean> polarfire is my witness here
<ValtheJean> last night dari admitted to the awesomeness of Caramel :P
<Dman> "I'm a goofy goober! ROCK! You're a goofy goober! ROCK! We're all goofy goobers! ROCK! Goofy goofy goofy goofy goober! ROCK! "
<prince-dari> No I didn't?
<RobotPinkie> haha
<Dman> "Put your toys away" Well then I got to say when you tell me not to play I say NO WAY! No no no no way! "I'm a kid" you say. When you say I'm a kid I say "Say it again." And then I say Thanks! THANKS! Thank you very much.
<Dman> (have to post legendary song)
<RobotPinkie> I like caramels, they're delicious
<Polarfire> well it goes 2 ways.
<CrossBreeze> I'd like to think you have a good set-up, the only thing I can really see as needing change is having back-ups to the planned streamers and checking for technical hiccups before screening, but that's more of a background thing, and something I'm sure you're already well aware of.
<Dman> So if you thinking that you'd like to be like me Go ahead and try. The kid inside will seeeeeeeeeet youuuuuuuuuuuu freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
<Sathi> good points he mentioned there
<prince-dari> When did I admit Caramel was awesome?
<RainBroDash> 10anybody here a fan of competitive Starcraft 2?
<Dman> robotpinkie - dinner eaten. Let's do this
<ValtheJean> just before I went to sleep
<RobotPinkie> Yay, let me know how the pic works, Dman
<Dman> will do
<Dman> in about 10 seconds :P
<ValtheJean> RBD: I love SC and SC2, but I stopped paying attention to the competitive ring after 2 came out
<CrossBreeze> I imagine viewership will grow exponentially at the return of Season 2, so that too, may solve itself on its own. Thus, no, I believe the current set-up and projected path is more than sufficient.
<prince-dari> Pfft, I don't remember this.
<Dman> RainBroDash - PLLAAAAAAYGUUUUUU
<Ziltoid> I look at some sc2 matches sometimes
<Sathi> 7Anyone seen the new MLP FIM soundboard?
<ValtheJean> yeah, but you still did :P
<Dman> PLAAAAYY GUUU
<Sathi> 7version 5.2 is out
<Dman> also, KEKSI
<Dman> KEKSI
<Dman> KEKSI KEKSI KEKSI
<ValtheJean> you can check the chat logs dari ;)

If I can be of help, then I will gladly do so. I would like to see this community strengthened and protected, so I thought I should do my part.

<Griggs> But I don't want to sleep

<Temeraki> NOT right now, but later
<Temeraki> You willllll
<Dman> yea, but will post here first
<Dman> ^_^
*Ray rawrs
<CrossBreeze> If you're asking if I understand how to use it, then yes. If you're asking if I know all the commands and how to use the technical side, then no, that is something I would have to be taught.
<RobotPinkie> sweet

<SirSprinkles> 6Okay, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview.
<CrossBreeze> Alright.
<Dman> I can do it in 1080p if wanted
<Dman> but i think 720p is enuf
<Dman> if 1080p wanted i can just rerender vid later
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm going to show you some images and I want you to tell me how you would respond as a mod if they were posted in the chat.
<RobotPinkie> yeah, i think 720p is good enough
<Rodman> >Leaves Bronystate open >Stream is off >Reads, and realizes he missed something
<Rodman> So what did I miss?
<CrossBreeze> Okay.
<Ziltoid> stuff

<Hipster_Brony> i feel bad for making cross look at cupcakes pics...
<ValtheJean> Dari was naked
<Rodman> oh
<Rodman> That
<Rodman> :V
<Nick> hey again lighty :)
<ValtheJean> he has scarred my fragile child mind
<prince-dari> Wait what?
<Ziltoid> rainbodash is now best pony
<prince-dari> That image?
<prince-dari> It doesn't have anything?
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Dman> lol
<ValtheJean> I don't think I'll ever recover now
<prince-dari> It doesn't have gore, R34.
<prince-dari> Shock.
<Rodman> She was always the best pony
<prince-dari> Anything.
<RainBroDash> yeah that image isn't bad imho, aside from the topic
<SirSprinkles> It's Cupcakes, it's a warning.
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<Ziltoid> best pony is fluttershy
<Rodman> YUP
<prince-dari> It's a reference to Cupcakes? So what. If you get the reference you either read it of your own accord
<RobotPinkie> Mane 6 is best pony...
<CrossBreeze> Well, Cupcakes is something we should try to avoid having the chat spammed with, but this isn't graphic, only suggestive, so I believe this merits only a verbal warning.
<prince-dari> or just know about Cucpakes
<SirSprinkles> Hence warning.
<ValtheJean> http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/www.ign.com/291/2011/01/So-it-begins-the-great-shitstorm-of-our-time.jpg
<RainBroDash> well there's nothing explicitly in the rules about that, so I'd give the poster a talking to, but no more :P
<Pattyrick> lighty! =D
<Ziltoid> lol
<RainBroDash> well he answered right anyway
<prince-dari> That just seems ridiculous to me. :/
<Rodman> Mane 6 is best pony............. I agree with this
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, second image: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/9bb1e06e5055352e074ea08c043bdbcc/26603%20-%20artist%3AEchidnaJoe%20implied_rape%20lesbian%20Mrs_Sparkle%20Trixie%20twilight_sparkle.png

<RobotPinkie> I AM PRINCESS LUNA!

<ValtheJean> Steven's database is incomplete thus cannot be word of law :P

<RobotPinkie> Aww, I like Sweetie Belle :(
<Hipster_Brony> i would say that the image falls under the rule about trolling more than gore
<Dermathil> >yfw back from shower

<lighty> 12 hours
<Rodman> Sweetie Belle is nice :(
<Hipster_Brony> which?
<CrossBreeze> Hmm. We definitely want to stay away from posting anything R34-ish in nature, but again, this is more suggestive than anything. Perhaps as an example, this would recieve a kick to let others know this is unacceptable.
<Barry> @pony ValtheJean's drinking buddy
<Steven_Magnet> 6 ValtheJean's drinking buddy is 15Prince Blueb8lood

<ValtheJean> you know, he'd be a hillarious drinking buddy
<Pattyrick> A bit longer than it was to get there, huh?
<RobotPinkie> Nice, Dman, doesn't look like there are any white edge pixels now
<ValtheJean> because like, he'd be a complete dick to all the ladies
<ValtheJean> then I'd swoop in
<Ziltoid> he would only drink wine
<SirSprinkles> It's supposed to be Sweetie Belle.
<ValtheJean> and be all "Sorry bout that babe, lemme buy you a drink"
<RainBroDash> ah
<ValtheJean> and then we'd hit it off
<SirSprinkles> And it's a verbal warning, I'd think.
<Barry> @pony Ziltoid's drinking buddy

<Light_Latias> 12hai Danny
<CrossBreeze> I'd say that no action be taken here. While the previous picture implied something more, and as such could inspire others to take it further, this seems fairly mundane, about as neutral as any shipping image really. No action taken.

<Rodman> Never let them near the kitchen
<RainBroDash> 10i hate you
<GGgala_> He will drink me under the tabl

<Dermathil> btw, about my earlier post about the Settling of the Bethesda/Mojang Lawsuit: http://www.pharfruminsain.com/Quake/Images/FAFA-Logo_150px.gif
<RobotPinkie> Wish I could've been there
<Barry> Hey guys, would you believe that someone made a fanfiction crossing Doctor Who with Harry Potter?
<Dman> i have a little too much favouritism over fluttershy, considering i say errypony best pony, cuz i have fluttershy toi :3
<Dman> nice gif dermathil
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Dman> Barry - whut
<Ziltoid> you can cross cr who with anything
<Dman> srsly whut
<ValtheJean> @Barry of course. Harry Potter fans are fucking crazy
<Ziltoid> dr who*
<ValtheJean> Harry Potter is basically the REASON shipping is still popular
<ValtheJean> god damn Harry Potter...
<Dman> sheeppeeng
<Ziltoid> wait really?
<RobotPinkie> lol
<Anth-Umbreon> ...oh yeah, sorry about the confusion |D
<Flutterpeanut> OFC I'D MISS IT.
<Rodman> EVERYONE, ABANDON SHIP!
<ValtheJean> you haven't seen shipping until you've seen harry potter shipping
<Dman> i wasn't even into shipping much, even thou a lot of my friends were, till FiM
<Ziltoid> I read a harry potter shipping fic once
<drfsupercenter> 03thanks
<SirSprinkles> The log's in his application thread, Peanut.
<Flutterpeanut> Wellfuck.jpg
<Dman> how does that work thou?
<ValtheJean> that shit will ruin your fucking brain
<Ziltoid> it was Hogwarts x giant ocyupus
<Dashite> Avatar shipping.
<Anth-Umbreon> /late
<Flutterpeanut> I know. I'm looking at the interview now.
<Barry> Basically, they take the main plot of Harry Potter, have The Doctor defeat Voldemort, with said Doctor taking Harry to his home planet, where, at the age of 8, the time lords make him one of them
<Dman> erryone in HP has a canon ship or dies or canon stays single, so how u ship HP?
<Ziltoid> Octopus*
<Vinyer> 12np
<Dman> Barry lol
<Vinyer> 12wait who are you thanking drf
<ValtheJean> Dman, you don't want to know
<drfsupercenter> 03you

<Vinyer> 12anth causing you confusion
<Vinyer> 12or me
<Vinyer> 12XD
<Dman> ValtheJean 0_0
<drfsupercenter> 03you for chaning the topic
<drfsupercenter> 03*changing
<Vinyer> 12ok
<Vinyer> 12[13:45:01] <Anth-Umbreon> ...oh yeah, sorry about the confusion |D
<Vinyer> 12[13:45:18] <drfsupercenter> thanks
<Vinyer> 12had to make sure :P
<Dashite> Dman, canon? Who needs canon? HarryxDraco is my OTP.
<ValtheJean> Harry Pothead fans can take even the SLIGHTEST of phrases and make the biggest fucking contradictions ever
<Dman> Dashite no u
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Dashite> :p
<EdwardNewgate> What about us HP fans who don't ship?
<Barry> It also has Dumbles bashing
<EdwardNewgate> or write fics
<Dman> Yea
<GGgala_> Dman: >implying canon ships get in the way of shipping
<ValtheJean> I would say nothing:
<Anth-Umbreon> ajksfhkjsdh
<Anth-Umbreon> agh XD
<Dman> True dat, GGgala_, True dat
<GGgala_> also, there ere YEARSbefore the last book came
<ValtheJean> I would only link (if I had it) the picture of Pinkie saying "Give her time"
<GGgala_> *there were years
<Ray> 02back
<EdwardNewgate> Also. Spoiler: Snape kills Dumbledore
<Barry> of course cannon ships would get in the way. have you seen those things?
<RobotPinkie> so is HP fanbase worse than us? omg
<ValtheJean> oh no, they even disregard canon ships
<Dman> Hey GGgala_ I read cupcakes today
<Flutterpeanut> I'd say he did pretty well and would make a good mod.
<Barry> they're a case of fandumb
<GGgala_> Dman: people were insanely delusional that Harry/Hermione would become canon, even after five books. o_0
<Anth-Umbreon> wb
<GGgala_> Dman: orly?
<Flutterpeanut> But I also have bias towards him because he's one of my big friends on the site.
<Dman> oh dear, gggala_
<Dman> and Ya rly
<Ziltoid> what did you think dman?
<Flutterpeanut> Like hipster
<Flutterpeanut> ^^
<GGgala_> how was it
<Dman> I have 2 things to say about it:
<Dman> 1) Huh, so that's how far it was taken. I see i see.
<Hipster_Brony> eeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
<EdwardNewgate> Plus HarryXLuna is my otp
<Barry> and 2?
<SirSprinkles> Hmm... where's Yusuke?
<Pattyrick> Wb Ray
<Rodman> I think Cupcakes was more Gore than actual Horror
<Dman> 2) This wasn't THAT bad, and pinkie made it funny. I thought it would be pinkamena, but a) pinkie made it funny, and b) couldhave been SO MUCH WORSE, even after reading alt endings. I mean, she has womanly parts, and theres a billion ways to torture before killing.
<Hipster_Brony> i dont think his interview is for another 45 minutes or so, is it
<Hipster_Brony> ?
<Hipster_Brony> also, brb
<SirSprinkles> >2:30
<Vinyer> 12wb
<Dman> Cupcakes was overhyped to me basically
<Hipster_Brony> oh
<Ziltoid> Yeah
<Ray> 02Thx
<Ziltoid> I had the same reaction to it
<SirSprinkles> Dman is 3:30
<EdwardNewgate> Dman Have you read Sweet Apple Massacre?
<Hipster_Brony> was thinking of Dman
<Dman> all i could think about was womanly parts and so much potential missed torture
<Dman> edwardnewgate no
<Barry> a lot of those people who complain about cupcakes are just drama queens
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<Dman> Yea barry
<SirSprinkles> It's possible that Yusuke just doesn't know about bronystate.co.cc and gave up since dinkypage is down.
<EdwardNewgate> Oh, It's imho worse than cupcakes
<RobotPinkie> Cupcakes just... isn't very good.
<Dman> I mean, 'I got my 'I' on you!'
<GGgala_> Dman: yeah people make a bigger deal out of it than it warrants. I think at one point #BronyState mods said 'no more talking about cupcakes' even
<Barry> I just won't read it because of the severe lack of grammar
<Dman> I literally laughed aloud, almost dropped my DS in the sand
<RobotPinkie> It doesn't ruin anything for me, I just think it's really badly written.
<prince-dari> Cupcakes has brilliant puns, don't be knocking them.
<Dman> Yea GGgala_ i got told that too
<ValtheJean> well then, we've done a great job about following that rule
<Dman> Dari - i'm saying it was brilliant!
<prince-dari> It's not badly written if you read the updated version.
<GGgala_> which is horse apples
<Dman> Dari - ionly read updated one
<Flutterpeanut> 13Never read it.
<Barry> where is that?
<Flutterpeanut> 13:P
<EdwardNewgate> Have any of you read Sweet Apple Massacre?
<Dman> it's not that bad
<Barry> no
<ValtheJean> ohai flutterpeanut
<RobotPinkie> Eh, guess I should read the updated version
<Flutterpeanut> 13I don't read any fanfics haha.
<Dman> no edwardnewgate, link phaps?
<Flutterpeanut> 13Hello Val.
<prince-dari> Well, I only read Cupcakes.
*ValtheJean brohoofs peanut
<prince-dari> Because it was hyped up so much.
<RobotPinkie> ohai Flutterpeanut
<Dman> same
<EdwardNewgate> If you want it, I can find it again. It's pretty bad
<prince-dari> I don't regret it, it was funny.
*Flutterpeanut 13brohoofs ValtheJean
<Dman> eyup
<ValtheJean> I am proud to say I have not and will NEVER read any fanfics
<Dman> edwardnewgate - if it's bad, then eh
<Flutterpeanut> 13Eeeyup.
<Hipster_Brony> hmmm
<EdwardNewgate> Not even Fallout: Equestria?
<prince-dari> I swear you said you'd read some fanfics when you were yougner.
<Dman> http://www.mediafire.com/?3prl5ig6md11e84 Prince-Dari, stream eet
<prince-dari> younger*
<prince-dari> :P
<Hipster_Brony> i think he probably would have emailed us thugh, right?
<Flutterpeanut> 13Nope.
<Hipster_Brony> though*
<ValtheJean> ESPECIALLY Fallout: Equestria
<RobotPinkie> yay upload is done!
<EdwardNewgate> Why not, it's wonderful
<ValtheJean> it's a fanfic
<ValtheJean> and thus pure and utter shit
<Dman> robotpinkie - yfw i checked it in editing software, and rendered uploaded and linked bfore even checking. >_< hope it rendere dok lol
<EdwardNewgate> That barely involves the mane 6
<Flutterpeanut> 13Fanfics out there like... Past Sins and Cupcakes and such have made me decide to never read any of them.
<RobotPinkie> Eh, fanfics aren't for everyone.
<EdwardNewgate> It's like pony fallout
<Flutterpeanut> 13Because people are dumb.
<RobotPinkie> lol check it now, Dman?
<Pattyrick> Warning: Skillz are required to enter this building
<ValtheJean> the one advantage to being an English major: I can use my elitism to never read fanfics
<Dman> rootpinkie - will do when dari streams ^_^
<prince-dari> Cupcakes was so funny, it's credit to team
<prince-dari> :P
<Dman> valthejean no u! first ,cross and arrow is hillarious, and 2nd 'kindness of strangers' is amazing.
<EdwardNewgate> Do you know how many published works are practically fanfics?
<RobotPinkie> gogogo prince-dari
<EdwardNewgate> A lot
<lighty> EVERYBODY'S RUSSIAN
<ValtheJean> Dman Nope. All fanfics, and are by definition shit
<Pattyrick> They should put that on the buildings that have boring 'Authorized Personelle Only' signs
<prince-dari> >implying all published works are good
<prince-dari> :P
<Flutterpeanut> 13I agree with Val.
<lighty> Lol
<RobotPinkie> lolol
<ValtheJean> lol, dari pretty much summed it up there
<Dman> also robotpinkie, like yday, were now watching LOTR 3 on projector, so if i vew we'll hear it thru speakers of 3x2 meter screen xD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Where is that phrase from, lighty?
<Ziltoid> NOPE
<Dman> lol
*Ray goes trough the door
<GGgala_> you're both nuts
<RobotPinkie> haha, oh okay

<Ray> 02Skillz weren't needed
<Dman> some fics good some fics shit some works good some works shit.
<RobotPinkie> then don't Dman :P
<lighty> Ray is awesome enough
<prince-dari> Oh God, I remember for English we had 'Hard Times' as for an essay.
<Dman> to go to either extreme is silly
<ValtheJean> well just look at fanfics
<prince-dari> Charles Dickens, you suck at writing.
<ValtheJean> of course they're popular
<EdwardNewgate> I've read many MANY VERY good fanfics
<prince-dari> Most boring book EVER written.
<Dman> robotpinkie - will see in stream, but again, no volume
<prince-dari> I only read 20 pages of the damn thing.
<ValtheJean> but nontheless suck ass :P
<Ray> 02:D
<prince-dari> Then read the summary on wikipedia instead.
<prince-dari> My God.
<EdwardNewgate> NO, GREAT EXPECTIONS WAS WORSE
<RobotPinkie> I'll let you know how it sounded, then, Dman
<prince-dari> I hate Charles Dickens.
<Rodman> Ever read "Brave New World"?
*Dman 's face when saruman on tower in isenguard - his face is 3 meters high D:

<Sathi> I can copy paste the previous interview
<Dman> INFINET XD
<ctr> ew runescape
<RobotPinkie> I... won't be able to watch it :P
<prince-dari> You probably can't see the different between 1080 and 1440
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Hipster_Brony> ok

<Dashite> 1440? What the hell is this shit? 1600 or bust.
<Skylands> 10[15:46] <drfsupercenter> this is a more upbeat remix <- Found it on YT
<Dman> dashite what?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's where I found it at first
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03a radio station here plays it
<RobotPinkie> but you're already rendering at 1080p, so
<Dman> 1440 is next scale thats commercially gunna be successful
<Dman> yea i am
<drfsupercenter> 03I just looked on YT for remixes until I matched it
<Dashite> Down with your shitty 16x9 aspect ratios!
<Dman> i'll just 1080p upload i guess...maybe...if i'm not shy which I am
<Skylands> 10Sped up

<RobotPinkie> inb4 this actually gets featured on EqD
<drfsupercenter> 03then started again recently :/
<Dman> had to lower speed of render so VLC would run smoother (it's reading a disk so yea)
<Skylands> 10But most of the mainstream songs sound better at a bit faster pace
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<drfsupercenter> 03the only downside

<RobotPinkie> the AJ vid
<GGgala_> i hear dari getting skyped
<ctr> and in before i quit, everyone !fight Insane_Lugia !
<Dman> It was pretty quiet, and only a few serious kicks had to be handed out. Just me and a frie,d so I did the kicking, but I never had to ban anyone
<RobotPinkie> what u say?
<Dman> (He played the games)
<Sathi> 7I see. What talents do you bring to the table?
<Ray> 02fail?
<Dman> Dashite - want that colgate so bad !!!
<Dashite> But, it's my colgate. I need it! I'd have to go buy more if you took this one. :(
<RobotPinkie> This chat is now about toothpaste.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<Dman> I'd like to say i'm fast at searching for things. I've helped a lot of bronies by posting what they requested to make life easier for the streamer, and just generally linked to / quoted what people wanted me to. I also, as I said in the email, read the comemnts, so i'd be able to catch anyone breaking rules or asking for help during the busy friday stream.
<RobotPinkie> or ponies, whatever...

<Sathi> 7: What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
<GGgala_> he can't hear you, dari
<RobotPinkie> That. Is. Awesome.
<Dman> ...talking to me?
<Rodman> Hey Dari, mind streaming this?
<GGgala_> talkin' bout how VLC rocks
<Rodman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44t7mAI1spY&feature=player_embedded
<Steven_Magnet> {1,0You0,4Tube}: "[MLP] Rainbow Dash is WINNING" - "duh, WINNING! represents about 20-25 hours of work, probably the most complex video i have done yet. it was really fun to do tho. i hope everyone likes it! o..."
<RobotPinkie> I have no idea, seductive jazz playing
<Dman> More advertising. It would be an idea to go on other popular brony hangouts and mention a small brief on what Bronystate is, with a link to us, whenever we're about to begin streaming. EQD is pretty much the only place right now that I see us mentioned in, but there's a lot more brony websites that are visited regularly, and we should try and contact the ones
<Ray> 02well, let's just rename it lame street
<RobotPinkie> >seductive jazz plus colgate brushing
<Ray> 02:D?
<RobotPinkie> >mfw
<Dman> in charge of those websites so as to make ourselves more known
<RobotPinkie> >OH GOD I HAVE NO FACE
<Hipster_Brony> keep going
<Hipster_Brony> ill let you know in mod chat if i want to chime in
<Dman> In terms of improving BMN, it's so good as it is, that perhaps some nifty scripts by dari (such as the trivia i'm working on) and perhaps a few small things like links to bronystate memes or something would make the place a little more fun too.
<Skylands> 10Good idea
<Dman> GGgala_ thanks for saying :P
<Dman> "You'll be like 'can't handle it!' "
<Sathi> 7Any other ideas?
<GGgala_> Dman: no prob bro
<RobotPinkie> I couldn't handle Dash, true.
<Sathi> roger
<Dman> A youtube account with favourited vids of the ones we tend to view here. Would be nice to visit, and mods who stream requests would have instant access to popular, and enjoyed, videos
<Sathi> great idea that
<Flutterpeanut> mmhm.
<Dman> Another idea would be to show trailers of next week's movies at some point during previous movie night
<Sathi> we even could use the BronyState account for that
<prince-dari> Hmm
<prince-dari> I like the youtube idea.
<Sathi> me too
<GGgala_> @deadmeter chat
<Steven_Magnet> 6 chat is 46% dead. (1478)
<Dman> perhaps a constant livestream of trailers of next week's movies + pony videos we like could be constantly streamed, like a betweenshows stream.
<RobotPinkie> @chatmeter dead
<Steven_Magnet> 6 dead is 10% chat. (1479)
<Dman> >_< cuz I.M.B.C.
<GGgala_> it's getting better!
<Dman> it is?
<prince-dari> Could set up a constant stream I suppose.
<GGgala_> according to Steven
<prince-dari> If we had all the videos in our youtube favourites.
<RobotPinkie> Time for some serious firepower
<Dman> GAIS http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/200/4/8/colgate_brushie_brushie_by_dragonmast81-d40p8u0.gif

<Dman> found a gif
<Dman> sorry kinda busy atm would have found it sooner
<RobotPinkie> Nice
<GGgala_> Dman: what is this and why can't i stop looking o_0
<Sathi> 7Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
<RobotPinkie> She looks so happy
<Dman> GGgala_, it is your life flashing before your ey-Bwushie bwushie bwushie bwushit
<Dman> bwushie *
<Dman> OH GOD THAT TYPO
<Dman> so sorry
<GGgala_> best typo
<RobotPinkie> Epic winning
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, i agree
<Hipster_Brony> we should definitely do that
<Dman> I'd love to be able to help out bronies who ask for help on fridays, and be seen, not just be a white text possibly missed due to everyone else being white text. I also, according to NewDCD, can stream videos. I'd need to try it first, but if I could i can stream requests when nopony else is free, and as I said, i'm EST + 6 hours, so i'm awake sometimes when
<Dman> other bronies are but no mods are
<RobotPinkie> >mfw no one stared at me when I bought ponies today.... until the cashier didn't ask if I wanted it wrapped
<Dman> I could also, as mentioned in the email, begin streaming the movies, incase sirsprinkles or newdcd is late, as I could download the movies during the week too. Just to keep the BMN timing
<RobotPinkie> It was funny.
<prince-dari> Backup streamers.
<prince-dari> Always good.
*Ray yawns loudly
<Hipster_Brony> eeeeeeeeeeyup
<Flutterpeanut> Yup.
<RobotPinkie> @killedmeter chat
<Steven_Magnet> 6 chat is 65% killed. (1480)
<Dman> The other reason I guess is to feel like i'm a bigger part of bronystate. I've made quite a few friends here, and would love to be a moderator, helping everypony whenever I can
<RobotPinkie> Time for a double tap
<Dashite> @pony The pony who killed the chat

<Dman> I spend a lot of time here, most of my online time in fact, so i'd always be around to have fun with other bronies, keep the rules, and make it fun hopefully. I actually started playing Hangman with _ _ _ _ _ for letters two days ago, and everyone was enjoying that. it would be good to do that in a colour that stood out too :P
<RobotPinkie> please not mouth to mouth :(
<GGgala_> sloppiest CPR ever
<RobotPinkie> lol stream something, dari, plz
<Sathi> 7Do you have any previous IRC experience?
<Dman> F.U.N.E.C.P.R.4.1.?

<GGgala_> dat white stuff

*Espeon now belongs to SilverSonic for 18 minutes
<SilverSonic> :3
*Umbreon now belongs to SilverSonic for 6 minutes
<RobotPinkie> I guess I asked for that
<Dman> Yes, once, with the videogame stream. Unless it's different here, and if it is it wouldn't be difficult to learn, i can pm, kick, ban, etc
<RobotPinkie> what I'd like?
<GGgala_> what ws that one with the family comedy?
<Sathi> 7That concludes the first part of the interview, we're gonna move on to the second part of the interview now.

<GGgala_> Ace/SilverMare?
<SilverMane> ... talk to my people
<Dman> So i wouldn't really kick for this, but i'd PM the brony and tell them not to mention any more cupcakes related things in bronystate, or kickings and a possible ban (D: ) will follow

<ValtheJean> YOU'VE CORRUPTED HIM
<Dman> only 55? lol
<ValtheJean> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO DARI?

<RobotPinkie> :O
<RobotPinkie> ahahahaha
<prince-dari> ...
<ValtheJean> btw dari you should totally continue that hardest puzzle on the internet
<SilverMane> ... ok, just let me turn down the volume
<prince-dari> Fumb Dabric
<prince-dari> Lol
<SilverMane> wait, isn't this just like the Twilight one?
<prince-dari> Suddenly game music.
<prince-dari> Dammit.
<ValtheJean> lol, so sound for me :P
<SilverMane> mfw i can hear Mardek finally
<RobotPinkie> lolol RPG sound
<GGgala_> "Rainbow Dash has joined your party!"
<ValtheJean> no*
<GGgala_> (why is she looking at you like that...)
<SilverMane> if only....
<Ray> 4Artist: 12 DragonForce 4Track: 12 Black Fire 4Album: 12 Valley of the Damned 4Time: 12 5:47 .
<ValtheJean> wait, am I the only one who can't hear any sound?
<prince-dari> I'll freeze chrome's flash player
<prince-dari> Sec.
<Ray> 02Well it works
<SilverMane> same reason Twilight did last week?
<Dman> lol, haven't seen that before, it's kinda cute :3. So aniway, again, during the week it isn't TOO much so it would probably pass, as i've seen other mods let these sorta things pass during the week. However, on a movie night, it's hard to say. I suppose i'd PM them with a warning, and also warn them, for others to see the warning, in Bronystate Channel. somet
<Ray> 02But it borks with / join
<SilverMane> Dari, you could just close the game; you havent' made any progress yet
<RobotPinkie> "Pinkie Pie has joined your party! Party upgraded to PAR-TAY!"
<prince-dari> AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
<Dman> hing like 'Remember to read our rules, linked above and below the chat. No r34, and i'd also ask no more pictures with the sort of content that picture had, [bronyname
<Dman> ] )
<GGgala_> prepare your bodies
<SilverMane> mfw it's just like the Twilight one, except her wings look odd, and she seems... chubby
<ValtheJean> no but seriously, I'm not hearing anything
<Sathi> 7okay, moving on to the last image:
<Ziltoid> How many times have you played this?
<Sathi> 7http://www.ponychan.net/chan/collab/src/130115591169.jpg
<GGgala_> not enough times, Ziltoid
<Dman> ... oh wow
<ValtheJean> I'm gona restart my browser...I'm not getting any sound
<GGgala_> >mfw the video hypnotizes everyone into killing chat for the second time
<Insane_Lugia> anybody like tool?
<Insane_Lugia> or blooddrunk
<RobotPinkie> whuh? There's chat?
<Dman> kick with more severe message, as that's some kissing and very bloody. maybe: (Don't post anything gory, or suggestive, or you will be banned.)
<Ziltoid> HHHNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG
<prince-dari> Don'y kill me.
<prince-dari> :<
<prince-dari> Don't*
<Dman> again, (rules found above and below chat)
<Ziltoid> DONY
<Ziltoid> kill dari please
<Dman> unless it's same pony paraspriting, in which case more kick, followed by ban if they should continue
<Barry> @pony the pony who permanently froze Google Chrome
<Steven_Magnet> 6 the pony who permanently froze Google Chrome is 3Granny Sm15ith
<Sathi> Do I need to explain to him that this image would result in a ban?
<GGgala_> Rainbow Dash Don'y is best Don'y
<prince-dari> Meh, we can explain to him if we hire him I suppose.
<Dman> sorry robotpinkie dari won't upload. at least not for like 3 more hours. I.M.B.C.
<GGgala_> dammit Granny! who taught you about the magic boxes whippersnappers use these days
<prince-dari> I would just say that's the end of the interview for now.
<Dman> With LOTR :P
<RobotPinkie> That's alright
<Dashite> No one taught Granny, that's how she screwed it up so much.
<Dman> :3
<prince-dari> Lol loop.
<Ziltoid> @pony and then everypony came exept for
<Steven_Magnet> 6 and then everypony came exept for is 10Sni5ps
<Dman> except for is :P
<RobotPinkie> lolol o u, dari
<Barry> lol
<Dman> Hey Dari would it be a good idea to remove 'is'?
<ValtheCaramel> would you mind kicking my alt?
<SilverMane> i had to quickly un-max screen my ps3 video of bronystate, mute the tv, then hide the chat because my fucking mom walked in right in the middle of sexy-dash-stare
<Dman> we could make SILLY things
<ValtheCaramel> since the son of a bitch wont disappear
<Dman> and also dari is it possible to make a script to replace '@pony'?
<Sathi> 7Alright, that was the last part of the interview.
<Dman> so we could have:
*SilverMane came
<Dman> fkdjsa;fkdsa;fds @pony jfdsal;ieowrd @pony kfjeiowpresa
<Barry> The script should be altered so it uses a set line depending on what is input
<Dman> ?
<ValtheCaramel> ty
<Dman> Would be so awesome dari
<Skylands> 10Never heard of either
<Ziltoid> lol silvermane

<GGgala_> lol kick the alt and then quit?
<HyperMetalLugia> Wut
<ValtheCaramel> you kicked the alt, yet it STILL wont let me use my name
<SilverMane> he said everypony came... although it'll be awkward to explain to MirthTinker, considering what we were doing at the time
<Ziltoid> EEYUP
<Insane_Lugia> hmm ill add them to my playlist when i get around to it.
<Lunies> Tool is good
<prince-dari> Of course it won't.
<prince-dari> It's still connected to the server.
<Dman> Only to thank all the mods for their hard work on Bronystate, I love you all
<ValtheCaramel> well yeah, quit so I can change my god damn name
<prince-dari> Kicking it doesn't DC it.
<Insane_Lugia> blooddrunk is metal, as well as deathklock
<ValtheCaramel> god damn it!
<HyperMetalLugia> Luna likes Tool? :o
<prince-dari> It takes at least 120 seconds.

<prince-dari> For a ping timeout to occur
<Sathi> 7Please be around next BMN show as we will announce further recruitment updates there
<GGgala_> how do i did irc?

<Dermathil> Haven't touched any of the games since G3.
<SilverMane> oh Prince-Dari, those exclamations before combat? If they are blue, you can press Z to skip combat, as the enemies are very weak. if red, you can't skip
<Dermathil> No G4 or 5 pokemans
<ValtheJean> yay!
<EdwardNewgate> >yfw I had Red, Blue, Yellow, Silver, Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Leaf Green, and Fire Red

<SilverMane> If you press the Right Arrow key when targeting an ally, you may cause the spell to target All Party, halving the effect, doubling the cost, but hitting everyone
<Dman> Dermathil - Mightyena my fave pokemon, followed by tied dewott (he my pokebro in black) and castform. Yours?
<SilverMane> same for enemies, but using the left key
<ValtheJean> that totally needs to be the catch phrase when you last hit people
<ValtheJean> "Tally Ho mother fucker"
<SilverMane> you're enjoying this now, aren't you val
<Dman> mightyena was my pokebro (pokesis i guess :P was female) in emerald and thru diamond.

<Dman> silvermane it's ok i asked dermathil for doc
<Light_Latias> 12XD

<Dman> silvermane - TON of stuff i missed. i left when it was just getting on with demrathil and topaz. g2 read scene :P
<ValtheJean> it sucks ass
<ValtheJean> YAY!
<Barry> In gen 5, Sturdy protects any Pokemon that has it from any attack that would KO it in one hit, even if they aren't one-hit ko moves
<ValtheJean> awwww
<ValtheJean> I wanted Durrrrgurrr dead :(
<RobotPinkie> I am not amused :P
<SilverMane> Dman, get ready for saucy followed by dawww
<ValtheJean> fuck durrgarr and his manboyish hair and lack of character
<Barry> Which leads to a lvl 1 Aron with Shell Bell defeating a Level 100 Pokemon

*Dman Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed.
<SilverMane> you did now
*Dman They then built a wall out of diamond and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an out into the wall, and the wall came out fine.
*Dman They then crashed a diamond car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors.
<SilverSonic> oh you kids and your touhou
<ValtheJean> brb, making that a meme now
*Dman They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours.
*Dman They rammed a wall of metal into a 400 mile per hour made of diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth's orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards midwestern Prussia at 400 billion miles per hour.
*Dman They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused two wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with two buildings in downtown New York.
*Dman They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive.
*Dman Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall traveling at miles, and the result proved without a doubt that diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not just the hardest metal known the man.
<Dman> And THAT is science
