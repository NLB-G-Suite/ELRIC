<RaveBrony> Meanwhile: Ikr?
<AJIsAwesome> One of the best Twoface designs I've ever seen.

<ASoftFluffyThing> All. That. MONEY.
<AlienWarhead> weeeeee
<Darf14> Thats a lot of money
<Ryunosuke> and all that money was spent on dents face
<Lyra`> also, im back, but im reading that fallout equestria fic; Murky Number Seven, its pretty good, like really good. give a good insite into the psychology of a slave

She SLAPS Bruce in the first movie and chides him for being a shame to his family name, then when she finds out he's batman she refuses to be with him because he's focused on trying to do the right thing. THEN she goes out with Dent WHO'S DOING THE EXACT SAME FUCKING THING only on a legal
<Lunac> That was real money they burnt too

<otakon> The climax of this movie is AMAZING
<pony_300> Silverscreen: LoL, hahahaha wow. Didn't realize that
<pony_2854> IT'S ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE
<oneoneeighteight> No one understands women
<Meanwhile> I bet this is going to b a dumb conversation.
<ASoftFluffyThing> It's about sending a message.
<Kandarihu> Darf14, quite the opposite, and that's a bad thing
<CK|Ded> Oh dear.
<cachi01|phone> Nintendo will release DLC for fucking new super mario bros 2 :/
<SirGanjalf> And then his dogs were no longer HUNG RAY!

<Pale_Horse> I'm not surprised that the Joker would be the type to burn millions of dollars... I AM a little surprised all the gang members helping him are though. :P
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: DLC for NSMB2?
<otakon> GO GO GO!
<Silverscreen> 01,11Shizuka: Wait, so you're saying it's a risk that she goes out with Bruce Wayne, who NOBODY knows is batman, but it's NOT a risk going out with the District Attorney who's Public Enemy #1 for all Mob Bosses.
<AJIsAwesome> WHAT?!
<cachi01|phone> AJIsAwesome, yes
<cachi01|phone> AJIsAwesome, ikr...
<RosePetal> GO!

<Lunac> BroPonyMEDIc prone to exploding though
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: dent also attracted the joker
<cachi01|phone> AJIsAwesome, nintendo is turning to shit what if the next thing is dlc for zelda?
<Lunairetic> why do i keep thinking about that YT vid about a guy in a lambo wearing a batman costume?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Also, take into consideration killing a DA's girlfriend is a lot worse than a crazy man in a suit
<Whistler> How many more hours? :|
<RosePetal> Get those people out of there they are gonna get blown up.
<otakon> you haven't seen a picture of my have you spiritwaffle have you?
<Kimori> I have call of duty 4 modern warfare but never actually played through the game
<RaveBrony> Wtf?
<Fluttercry> 05,15So it does make sense

<RosePetal> Dat theme song.
<Meanwhile> It's cute when you think you're that complex.
<otakon> Shizuka: dammit stop being so mysterious!
<Silverscreen> 01,11The only thing the public would see is the DA's assistent dating an extremely eccentric and extremely stupid rich man.
<otakon> damn shifty ladies
<RaveBrony> :D ^
<Kimori> oh alright
<Kandarihu> I'd say they have 60 minutes to fake Reese's death.

<otakon> bye Lyra` take care
<RaveBrony> :o

<SirGanjalf> Fun Fact: Bruce Wayne is driving Lamborghini Murcielago in that scene: "Murcielago" means "Bat",
<Barbetos> Honestly I think Rachel likes being with the more dangerous of the two. Its more exciting, and makes her eggs drop.

<Tovler> inb4 Heath actually forgot his line and is actually that good at improv
<inkBot> love that analogy
<ASoftFluffyThing> spiritwaffle, mmmyes
<Meanwhile> CK|Ded: Tbh I'd be more concerned about the regular criminals. Joker and co are crazy but they're playing on Batmans level, I'd be more worried that Bruce'd die than me in that scenario.
<CK|Ded> Silver: Except, you know, for EVERYONE who figures it out. :P
<oneoneeighteight> My life in a nutshell
<Shizuka> 13if someone threatens dent, there's an entire city of cops standing by (despite the point that they're shown to be lethally stupid)
<Nittany_Discord> Later Lyra`.
<otakon> Silverscreen: it's more of her constantly worrying about her lover/husband when he goes out.
<RosePetal> Poor Harvey Two Face.
<Shizuka> 13if someone threatens batman, you're hosed
<Ryunosuke> ya, heath is we...
<Ryunosuke> well
<Xaiden> Shizuka: For a second, i thought you meant Spaz as in Spas-12. And That would be super effective
<Ryunosuke> bat-shit crazy
<ASoftFluffyThing> God, DOES HE HAVE ON NAILS?
<CK|Ded> Silver: Especially in the last movie, where basically everyone figures it out before the movie's half over
<Barbetos> Silverscreen its about the sex appeal, and there is way more danger in a DA like Harvy dent
<Foal_Brovakiin> Goodnight everyone, thanks for the film :)
<whysoserious> yeah, but, youre batman
<ASoftFluffyThing> I JUST noticed that.
<pony_2854> c'mere
<BroPony|MEDIC> Bye Foal_Brovakiin
<otakon> ASoftFluffyThing: I think he painted his nails
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care Foal_Brovakiin.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: well apparently the cops cant do anything, because joker is currently talking to him alone
<Barbetos> More danger = more sex appeal.
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Foal_Brovakiin :)
<otakon> I see bandages on his fingers however
<pony_2854> KILL HIM
<ASoftFluffyThing> otakon: Okay then. I just noticed that after this long.
<AlienWarhead> bye Foal_Brovakiin
<SirGanjalf> If Batman's symbolic animal is a bat(duh), then Joker's is a dog.
<twilight_sprinkle> dat nurse outfit
<otakon> RAMIREZ!
<weeping_pegasi82> I just got back from chasing my little siblings with a lightsaber :$
<spiritwaffle> LQL (laughing quite loudly)
<Silverscreen> 01,11In the public eye, Batman and Wayne have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Hell Wayne openly shows he HATES batman. So Her dating BRUCE WAYNE wouldn't be a danger because she WOULDN'T be with BATMAN.
<otakon> wb weeping_pegasi82 did you have fun?
<mitamaking> SirGanjalf: A hyena
<Fluttercry> 05,15But what if someone figures out who Batman is?
<CK|Ded> Silverscreen: Third movie. :p
<Barbetos> Silverscreen your being shizutroll'd
<Darf14> RAMIREZ! Defeat Handsome Jack!
<Fluttercry> 05,15Then you're up a creek
<pony_300> Shizuka: To be fair, this movie wound up proving all that wrong. Both are shown to be equally bad here
<CK|Ded> Silverscreen: How many people figure it out? Like, EVERYONE.
<weeping_pegasi82> otakon: Yep but dead tired
<CrimsonPhoenix> Fluttercry, like Dr.Strange?
<RosePetal> Regular Fans: It's the Joker and Two Face. Rabid Fangirls: OMG JOKER TWO FACE KISS NOW!
<twilight_sprinkle> Fluttercry: its still safer with batman than with the cops
<otakon> Silverscreen: except it's more of a thing that she doesn't want to be with a guy that constantly throws himself to the jaws of death on a nightly basis.
<Barbetos> Not Mayor Mare!!
<spiritwaffle> that line
<SirGanjalf> mitamaking: meh, dog-alike enough for me
<otakon> One little old mayor
<Silverscreen> 01,11otakon: THEN WHY THE FUCK IS SHE DATING MOB ENEMY #1?!?!
<Ryunosuke> hey joker, news flash: the best laid plans last about 5 seconds
<RosePetal> Chaosssss.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> he works for Discord
<RosePetal> Discord.
<AlienWarhead> I think we figured out that Racheal should dated more normal guys
<Lunairetic> So hes hannibal all of a sudden
<mitamaking> Silverscreen: love?
<Sinestro> FOR THE DARK GODS
<otakon> Silverscreen: bc he's not JUMPING ON ROOFS
<OohShiny> Discord approves this
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> its fair
<CK|Ded> I actually like this setup, with Joker triggering Two-Face's birth.
<BroPony|MEDIC> what if harvey stop him :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> CHAOS
<princess> brb my friend is rping and shes acting like the joker
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chaos
<Rosfox> Discord much?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Silverscreen because she has the protection of the law and not a billionare in a suit
<twilight_sprinkle> its beer?
<Whistler> CHAOS
<otakon> Silverscreen: and she's a lawyer too
<CK|Ded> It seems to work in this context.
<Xaiden> Just like Far Cry 3, HAS A CHANCE TO END IT BUT PUSSIES OUT
<Tovler> That's not my theory on chaos
<otakon> Chaos is NOT fair
<Spectrum_Rush> this such a fun conversation, it's definetally going some where, and not in circles >_>
<Meanwhile> Silverscreen: otakon doesn't actually have his own say in this so you can pretty much ignore him.
<RosePetal> Agent of Discord. Who else is an agent of Chaos?
<otakon> it's just random
<Whistler> Discord IS joker!
<LunasGuard> so joker made two-face
<Aircrafter> Chaos is fun.
<otakon> You die
<Nittany_Discord> Far Cry 3 isn't even out yet.
<Shizuka> 13consider also that dent doesn't exactly try to get his sorry ass killed
<RosePetal> U win this round Joker.
<RAWRity> this man watched Return of Harmony one too many times.
<mitamaking> You know what, screw the coin
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Maybe she wants to date Dent?
<CK|Ded> otakon: In theory, that's WHY it's fair. No bias towards any person, it just happens.
<SirGanjalf> Now we're talkin!
<Whistler> You die, and i watch full house :3
<otakon> CK|Ded: yeah true
<Shizuka> 13bruce wayne spends his nights looking for trouble
<pony_2854> FUCCKKKKKK
<pony_101010101000101> AAAAWWW
<otakon> AND WAYNE WITH THE BLOCK!
<Aircrafter> I APPROVE OF THIS!
<Silverscreen> 01,11A billionare in a suit that's designed to keep him alive and has proven that he can take care of himself. Hell, THIS MOVIE openly shows that dating Dent is what got her killed!
<pony_2854> R.I.P. SEXY CAR
<pony_101010101000101> DAT CAR!!!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Good Guy Bruce, or just a bad driveR?
<twilight_sprinkle> Fluttercry: the law couldnt protect her in a building full of cops
<RosePetal> Even the Joker uses Hand sanitizers.
<otakon> also hand sanitizer
<Darf14> He hit Bruce! Sueing time
<spiritwaffle> good hygene
<Ryunosuke> :( that car
<Lunac> The Joker the only guy to use those hand creams
<cachi01|phone> DERPDERPDERPDERP, both
<pony_300> that look
<RosePetal> Boom.
<SirGanjalf> POW! haha!
<AJIsAwesome> THat car could've gotten its own movie. ;9
<Spectrum_Rush> kapoff
<Barbetos> Oh that brings up another good point. She would get less sex with batman
<CrimsonPhoenix> This scene
<Aircrafter> So f**king sexy.
<taoumi> ppbpbpbpbpbpb
<inkBot> dat walk
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl
<otakon> Silverscreen: he can protect himself NOT those who are close to him that well as we've seen
<AJIsAwesome> *:(
<spiritwaffle> xD
<Squallken> lol
<Barbetos> It all makes perfect sense now.
<ASoftFluffyThing> pfffff

<CK|Ded> Hellooooooo nurse?
<Xaiden> he walks like a zombie
<CrimsonPhoenix> Micheal Bay Came

<whysoserious> *pekew!*
<Darf14> walks away like a boss
<Pale_Horse> Cool guys don't look at explosions! :D
<Rustymeat> this scene is so good
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lol Joker is waddling
<RainbowGuy> Joker's reaction to these explosions was real
<otakon> magmablock: really?
<RosePetal> Walk out of exploding hosipital dressed as a nurse like a boss.
<Xaiden> wait where's dent?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol stops
<Lunac> All this Ledger improv
<taoumi> cool guys don't look at explosions
<Fluttercry> 05,15improvised scene number 435

<Shizuka> 13you can't arm rachel or else the link between batman and bruce wayne is obvious
<Spectrum_Rush> lol nope
<spiritwaffle> clickity click click
<otakon> RainbowGuy: really?
<AJIsAwesome> RosePetal: yep.
<Darf14> lol
<SirGanjalf> Should've bought American detonator...
<Squallken> cool guys dont look at explosions
<inkBot> "that's all?"

<BroPony|MEDIC> Wtf....There it is :)
<AJIsAwesome> Fluttercry: IT WAS? :O
<RainbowGuy> otakon yeahh
<Tovler> dat Single-payer health care system
<otakon> inkBot: I thought the VERY same thing
<MrBen> And this.
<Ryunosuke> thats it?
<Silverscreen> 01,11otakon: he did pretty damn good with protecting her when Joker tossed her out the window. Alfred hasn't needed protecting, nore has Morgan Freeman's character.
<OohShiny> oops
<RaveBrony> Lmao
<Ryunosuke> lol
<SirGanjalf> :D
<spiritwaffle> xD
<RosePetal> He di.

<Darf14> Even jokers bombs dont work most of the time
<Sinestro> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
<Everlasting_Joy> I love his nonchalont approach there :).
<Whistler> Discord!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Micheal Bay came
<RAWRity> funfact: that was improvised
<RaveBrony> KA-Blooey!
<diddutz> no trivia on this scene silver?
<whysoserious> toy explosion!
<Meanwhile> Skulls for the skull throne
<RosePetal> He just got into the bus where there are people.
<Kandarihu> Wait a minute. So Two Face is dead?
<whysoserious> yay
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: The Lost Tribe
<Meanwhile> Milk for the Khorne flakes.
<RaveBrony> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh god :D
<Tovler> That scene was also accidental improv is there nothing Heath can't do?
<SirTornado> Discord, real life style O_O
<Spazturtle> that was NOT CGI
<Shizuka> 13Silverscreen: in the first case, that was because he was there, if batman was on the other side of town, pfft
<Lunac> They actually blew up a real hospital for this
<otakon> Silverscreen: I don't fucking know then
<RosePetal> Two Face escaped.
<MrBen> Kandarihu: Nope!
<mitamaking> Good thing he didn't get to the hospital
<otakon> and rumble
<Everlasting_Joy> RAWRity: He played it well.
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Michael Bay's pants are basically soaked by now.
<otakon> ahem rubble
<Xaiden> Kandarihu: Well, since it's DC Universe, he lives
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: eeyup
<RAWRity> it was originally meant to be the joker walking away as the explosions went off, but there was a short malfunction with some of the explosives.
<Nittany_Discord> Like to see Dark Knight Rises eventually.
<Forgottencrow> Future 2 face baman ?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: it's good
<Barbetos> So where is the part where the mods are told to stfu about a stupid plot point that has been over talked? Oh never. right.
<pony_300> CrimsonPhoenix: phbbt, needs moar stupid jokes before the explosion
<Meanwhile> Ledger was just that smooth.
<AlienWarhead> WHERE IS HARVEY DENT!
<Nittany_Discord> As good as Dark Knight?
<otakon> Barbetos: just Silverscreen is going on about it
<RAWRity> Ledger decided to stay in character and play it like it was meant to happen.
<Shizuka> 13WHERE ARE THEY
<OohShiny> God
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: better in some ways
<XylemTube> Nittany_Discord: Spoiler Alert, the audience dies
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, sadly not
<CK|Ded> Funny thing?
<AJIsAwesome> Dang, Michael Bay, how many spare change of pants do you have? :S
<Barbetos> otakon its just a joke =P
<RaveBrony> Damn, lol
<whysoserious> whats the b movie tonight?
<otakon> Barbetos: ah
<MrBen> otakon: Compared to the server it's 1.69 Mbps for a Download, 2,91 Mbps for an upload. I got 41 ms, 3.92 Mbps Download, 3.05 Mbps Upload on the retest
<Silverscreen> 01,11Shizuka: Joker was only there because Dent was there. Again, She got in danger because she was dating DENT.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> AJIsAwesome: A lot, I hope.
<MrBen> otakon: Sorry for the extended delay
<Meanwhile> Ha ha haha haha.
<otakon> MrBen: lower left corner
<Kandarihu> Xaiden, that rule is what Marvel is infamous for. But I'm aware of the rule of offscreen death. If it seems that "Nobody could've survived that", then any important characters probably did survive it.
<CK|Ded> The routine Joker does here? It reminds me of Sean Hannity's routine of repeating key words in other people's speeches
<Crippler> IT'S TIME TO PLAY THE GAAAAAAMMMMEEE
<Spazturtle> Silverscreen: What is b move?
<SirTornado> whysoserious Living in Obllivion
<otakon> Silverscreen: she was a prosecutor ON THE CASE
<RosePetal> NO.
<SirTornado> (spelling)
<otakon> Silverscreen: THAT IS WHY SHE WAS TAKEN
<CK|Ded> SEAN HANNITY IS THE JOKER
<MrBen> otakon: Yeah, I'm lookin'. All it tells me is my IP address.
<otakon> Dating Dent WAS SECONDARY
<whysoserious> sirtornado kk thx
<RainbowGuy> What's B movie tonight?
<SirTornado> If you want to know, Living in Oblivion is the B Movie
<Meanwhile> otakon please stop involving yourself in that you're sucking the fun out of it.
<otakon> I don't remember tbh
<CK|Ded> ....that actually would make sense.
<Xaiden> Kandarihu: Like Tony Stark in the Avengers?
<Fluttercry> 05,15CK|Ded that explains so much
<RosePetal> It's a movie whithin a movie talking about movies.
<otakon> Meanwhile: no just trying to shed light on it
<Barbetos> Silverscreen I don't think she is trying to prove whether or not Batman was safer, just the fucked up logic that is woman.
<Big_macinsocks> who are those old guys?
<Tovler> I've got to take a leek like Farfetch'd
<OohShiny> what's B movie tonight?

<Nyst> This Dent will be dead in days because of blood poisoning.
<Shizuka> 13isn't makeup, it's grey mo-cap mask
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The delay in explosives at the hospital wasn't scripted. The bombs didn't go off as plan and Ledger had to keep in character as best as he could. The explosions really did make him jump before he rushed into the busses as was in the script.
<otakon> Beautiful
<SirGanjalf> peeping Batman
<Shizuka> 13burnt side is all cg
<MrBen> otakon: *shrug* I don't know. I just don't know.
<RosePetal> It's DC. Don't question the logic.
<otakon> Silverscreen: it was AWESOME
<Tovler> Batman stole this idea from Nintendo
<pony_2854> "No, we don't spy on phones, Batman does that sort of shit!"
<Whistler> Who is streaming?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: obviously, i just mean they overdid it
<CK|Ded> Silver: LOL
<AJIsAwesome> Silverscreen: THAT IS AMAZING.
<SirGanjalf> This is WRONF
<CK|Ded> That's golden
<SirGanjalf> *WRONG

<Darf14> *flips coin* Heads! .....oh its Tail- *BANG* >_<
<Mozdoc> That is amazing movie trivia. Bravo performance.
<otakon> MrBen: yeah I don't know what to tell you man it's just hiccups in your IP. Contact them
<RosePetal> This is wrong? Like everything else is wrong.
<Shizuka> 13yep i want to date the guy that spies on the entire city

<Lunairetic> watching an epileptic show all day...hell yea
<MrBen> otakon: Alright. Thanks anyway, man.
<otakon> He must have Science 100 to use that
<Meanwhile> Morgan Freeman is best god.
<SirGanjalf> Bruce Wayne is really into voyeurism...
<magmablock> Why is he still doing the voice alone with someone who already knwos who he is?
<spiritwaffle> mlgl33thaxorpr0

<Mitch> >greentexting
<Silverscreen> 01,11otakon: okay, she was taken for her profession. But if it weren't for Joker switching the locations, Batman would have SAVED HER, or had died with her. Again, how is being with Dent safer?
<Spazturtle> magmablock: When you get into charter it shard to swap
<RosePetal> And so People finally realize that Gotham is dangerous and decide to leave Gotham City.
<SirGanjalf> Meh, Freeman is God - he's used to spying on people
<pony_300> otakon: weeelll if you're refering to the next movie, not really. :lol:
<mitamaking> CK|Ded: he said he would leave if that machine is there, wait
<otakon> Silverscreen: it wasn't, being with Dent had nothing to do with her getting kidnapped
<SaxyPretender> 0,14do mine eyes detect kvetching?
<RosePetal> It's a trick.
<AJIsAwesome> I don't know.
<LunasGuard> here we go
<otakon> Silverscreen: it would have happened if she was with Bruce since she was STILL a target for assassination
<whysoserious> this scene, i dont understand
<RosePetal> Hello I is Two Face.
<twilight_sprinkle> lookin good, dent!
<CK|Ded> mitamaking: Yeah, and it's there until the end of the film. :P
<otakon> Seriously he must be in SO much pain
<Silverscreen> 01,11otakon: good point there.
<AlienWarhead> Why are we still talking about Racheal?
<RainbowGuy> How'd Ywo Face get in the car?
<whysoserious> why would the driver just allow some guy with a gun into his car?
<RosePetal> His other eye didn't blink!
<Meanwhile> His other eye doesn't have a lid
<RosePetal> He was threatned.
<AJIsAwesome> whysoserious: The plot demands it.
<Fluttercry> 05,15because he would get shot if he didn't obviously
<mitamaking> CK|Ded: no, watch what happens after he puts in his name
<Whistler> :[
<Fluttercry> 05,15That eye would get really dry
<AlienWarhead> 6_9
<Shizuka> 13appropriately his left eye is getting more red because he can't apply tears to it
<otakon> Silverscreen: that's what your hung up on, she wasn't in danger because of dating Dent, she was in danger because she was in charge of the case with it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> he's not
<otakon> Shizuka: good
<SirGanjalf> OH SNAP!
<Azuredragon> Your driver...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Your driver

<CK|Ded> mitamaking: I know, I've seen the movie. I'm saying it's in the film until the end. :P
<pony_300> was the driver a bad guy or smething?
<otakon> Xaiden: the man's pain tolerance is through the roof since hALF HIS FACE IS BURNT OFF

<Dark_Horst> good thing i saw darl knight on tv. else, i would be sad now^^

<twilight_sprinkle> dat present
<Shizuka> 13WHERE IS CHANCES

<Dark_Horst> SHIPS!
*SirGanjalf is the Agent of Discord

<Lunac> buffer
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Even if they just showed the common folk forming a resistance against Bane or something it would've been better, instead it was ignored.
<Whistler> dat dot\
<otakon> Seriously HOW DID THEY NOT KNOW THAT WAS ON BOARD?
<pony_300> DERPDERP: The message?
<RosePetal> BOMB!
<Whistler> OMG
<Kandarihu> RosePetal, yeah. I was waiting for this scene that the sketch was parodying
<LunasGuard> spider sense is tingling
<Shizuka> 13he was unbuckling
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Blood is only ever seen three times on-screen: on the face of the civilian Batman that the Joker hangs, on Harvey's pillow in the hospital, and on Batman's arm due to the dog attacking him; most of the violence either occurs off-screen or is obscured by camera angles.
<pony_2854> Unless...
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 big scary black man
<SirGanjalf> Ah, the infamous ferry scene...
<Fluttercry> 05,15Spectrum_Rush I think she was pointing out that one scene he was in the car, the next he was gone
<Whistler> JOKER!
<Pale_Horse> Only Spiderman can save them now... 6_9
<Azuredragon> "and then he herded them onto a boat, then he scared the crap outa every single one!"
<RaveBrony> Oh, while its fresh in my mind. Nittany_Discord, MvM has been called off. Toy probably lost internet for the next month and a half...
<Whistler> Nope.
<princess> sky high PUT ME IN THERE
<otakon> Azuredragon: lol
<Whistler> SUPERMAN!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> pony_300: I just mean the "these people just showed you they still have heart" or whatever Batman says.
<Shizuka> 13the next shot the car flipped and dent was in the process of getting out
<mitamaking> Pale_Horse: But Spiderman can't swim
<pony_300> ahhh
<Meanwhile> Dent buckled his belt let the car flip then got out.
<otakon> This climax is awesome
<Nittany_Discord> Wow. What happened?
<RosePetal> And from dat day foreward it was called a ZOO.
<Xaiden> otakon: But that doesn't mean that being in a car Wreck with a high pain tolerance gives you a higher chance of living
<CK|Ded> What amuses me about this scene is that it makes a good psychology experiment. Did Joker really give them the bombs to the opposing boat, or did he give them the detonator to THEIR boat hoping they've kill themselves?
<Pale_Horse> :D
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> But then they do absolutely nothing in DKR...
<RaveBrony> Money issues... :(
<Eli> Silverscreen: not true. it's also a puddle under the bank man in the first sceene
<Darf14> Unless its a Farm!
<AlienWarhead> I actually think their detenter will blow their own boat
<Everlasting_Joy> RaveBrony: Aww. . .
<CK|Ded> Because knowing Joker, either is actually a valid call
<SirGanjalf> Unless it's a ferry!
<RaveBrony> But! Hes on a date right now, so hes doesnt care :D
<Dark_Horst> i dare say it, batan sounded better in the germa dub
<RosePetal> He has lost it.
<Shizuka> 13CK|Ded: the only winning move is not to play
<BroPony|MEDIC> Dat Catch 22
<RaveBrony> Wantd me to tell you, Everlasting_Joy :P
<otakon> Xaiden: true he was probably injured but he shrugged it off since he couldn't feel the pain. He buckled up and it kept him from getting killed.
<Nittany_Discord> Adobe crashed twice. :/
<Thulu-tan> I found a post on 4chan that Shizuka would enjoy: "asuka is best pony "
<pony_300> DERPDERP: I can see your point, though on the otherhand maybe they didn't want to the spiderman route...
<Tovler> this is a better boat-related movie than Battleship
<Barbetos> Democracy!
<CK|Ded> Shizu: Dat reference. XD
<RosePetal> NO WE HAVE TO ABANDON SHIP.
<pony_300> middleground might've been good
<Dark_Horst> so why are they transporting prisoners on a civilian crusieship again?
<Whistler> When is this over!
<RosePetal> ABANDON SHIP ABANDON THE SHIP!
<Pale_Horse> I think Batman/Spiderman would make an awesome team. Curse the fact that they belong to different companies. :|
<Everlasting_Joy> RaveBrony: I figured he would, but that doesn't mean I'm not disappointed.
<otakon> RosePetal: he'll blow them both if that happens
<SirGanjalf> Here's the question: What about the CREW?
<Mozdoc> Voting never works.
<Dark_Horst> anybody explain this logic
<Spectrum_Rush> RABBLE RABLE RABBLE RABBLE
<otakon> RosePetal: HE WILL BLOW THEM BOTH
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> CK|Ded: I think he'd want the people who'd blow up the boat to save themselves to live.
<RosePetal> Oh never mind.
<otakon> HARUMPH!
<CK|Ded> We should talk about murder and put it to a vote! LOL WE'RE MUCH BETTER PEOPLE
<BroPony|MEDIC> GOD society is so fucling retarded
<otakon> HARUMPH!
<mitamaking> I wish Scarecrow was in this scene
<LunasGuard> people show their true color
<Tovler> mutually assured nautical destruction
<Shizuka> 13notice how we linger on the civilians working it out
<SirGanjalf> You want to blew the crew and guards just like that too?
<Shizuka> 13and not the prisoners
<Sinestro> nice suit
<AlienWarhead> I'm sure we can trust Joker's word
<Whistler> dat suit
<RosePetal> She trust me.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> pony_300: I know what you mean. They wouldn't need to go that far though.
<RaveBrony> Yeah :\
<Fluttercry> 05,15We're the true monsters!
<otakon> Shizuka: huh? what's the significance of it?
<Shizuka> 13would ruin the stereotype buildup to show us what the prisoners were doing
<Shizuka> 13up until the guy tosses the detonator
<otakon> Shizuka: oh yeah good point
<cachi01|phone> he is a clown trust him
<RosePetal> He punched her..
<Darf14> KO!
<Kandarihu> Are the prisoners even working it out? All I see are the prisoners rioting and the guards shooting them.
<mitamaking> I wish she was in DKR
<AJIsAwesome> KO!!!!
<Lunac> Don;t talk to him about hospital bills
<Sinestro> she'll live
<princess> pawnch! XP
<otakon> Kandarihu: they aren't rioting
<Pale_Horse> No. I'm pretty sure the zombies are the true monsters... :|
<otakon> Kandarihu: but they are getting rowdy
<RaveBrony> Another 'Live'?? Nerf that coin
<RosePetal> The true monster is SOPA.
<CK|Ded> DERP: That's why I love that situation. It's a great psychology experiment.
<Shizuka> 13end of the scene one big guy steps up to take the detonator then tosses it out, everyone else is calm
<Lunac> Too easy
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Yeah I don't think the prison guards are letting the prisoners have a say in what they decide.
<Azuredragon> Clowns standing completly still infront of the windows, seems legit
<otakon> Shizuka: damn scene brought tears to my eyes
<Shizuka> 13which would imply the prisoners reached the same decision as the civilians, use the detonator but no one wants to be the one to do it
<mitamaking> Look, Joker is the bad guy
<DoctoDoctorWho> wazzup bronies?
<Kandarihu> It's hard to tell rowdy from rioting as it's happening
<SirGanjalf> And another thing that buggers me: It's JOKER'S plan. How are they sure that he didn't connect the detonators to their own boats?
<AlienWarhead> hi DoctorDoctorWho
<DoctoDoctorWho> batman?
<princess> passes Nittany_Discord paper
<RosePetal> FIVE MINUTIES!
<SirGanjalf> I mean, THAT WOULD BE THE JOKE
<Pale_Horse> Fun Fact; They aren't. :D
<mitamaking> SirGanjalf: That is the point
<pony_300> this part is so badass
<Meanwhile> In a group of mass murderers there's bound to be at least one willing to pull that lever.
<twilight_sprinkle> wee
<RosePetal> I CAN FLY!
<otakon> SirGanjalf: true but that wouldn't be twisted enough. He's probably hoping that they blow each other up anyway
<mitamaking> You don't know
<CK|Ded> BATVISION
<otakon> SirGanjalf: it's more fun that way
<Nittany_Discord> What's on the paper?
<otakon> BAT EYES
<CK|Ded> Omni on beta?
<RosePetal> Whoa.... Batman eyes are glowing it's kinda creepy.
<Big_macinsocks> why where they standing so still...
<CK|Ded> That's gibberish
<Darf14> Science at work
<Lunac> Not only does he have to protect the hostages but the SWAT teams too.
<RosePetal> They are dummies.
<otakon> RosePetal: Sonar heads up
<DoctoDoctorWho> dats trippy
<Forgottencrow> LOL SHIT TAKEN FROM BATMAN GAMES
<otakon> Forgottencrow: the other way aroudn
<Nyst> So all the cops, criminals and hostages are wearing cellphones?
<Shizuka> 13no no no gordon
<Dovah> ohai DoctoDoctorWho
<RosePetal> WHERE ARE THEY!
<Azuredragon> If it was bat vision it would just be a black screen...
<Shizuka> 13you're saying it wrong
<otakon> Forgottencrow: also TAS did this first anyway
<Nittany_Discord> Money. It's the thing many of us are having trouble getting.
<Forgottencrow> otakon still cool
<Tovler> where my Family Guy'd?
<otakon> Azuredragon: they aren't blind you know
<Meanwhile> Repeat joke as neccessary.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Fluttercry> 05,15Give me back my family!
*DoctoDoctorWho glomps AJIsAwesome
<mitamaking> THIS IS SO DANG TENSE
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<Meanwhile> Tell me about it.
<RosePetal> Hostage.
<DoctoDoctorWho> hey Dovah
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Nyst: Maybe the cellphones are in their stomaches, like with the fat guy.
*AJIsAwesome glomps DoctoDoctorWho as well :$
<otakon> eeyup
<CK|Ded> NOW YOU FUCKED UP. :|
<otakon> hiya Dovah
<Pale_Horse> Onee Chan!
<Nittany_Discord> Red team? But they're black.
<AJIsAwesome> CK|Ded: Oniichan~
<otakon> eyah this won't end well
<RosePetal> What if Joker put bombs inside them? :O
<otakon> RosePetal: no
<Lunac> Nittany_Discord Red lettering
<J_E_Smith71> Howdfy folks. Well my internet derped and I've missed almost the whole movie. Oh well there's always tomorrow on Euro Night
<Shizuka> 13swat loaded out with eight snipers and a spy
<Shizuka> 13and they're all F2P
<RosePetal> Ok then.
<Barbetos> Was that.. The guy from Crank?
<princess> once again wheres luna when u need her :|
<Azuredragon> Otacon, i thought they were, isnt that the point of thier screeching and super hearing
<otakon> Shizuka: lol
<SirGanjalf> otakon: ople blowing themselves up, thinking that will save them - looks like a Joker kind of humor to me.
*DoctoDoctorWho somehow has participated in a double glomp:$
<Ponymatic> Shizuka: Hahaha
<SirGanjalf> *people
<RaveBrony> Yeah :\
<spiritwaffle> DoctoDoctorWho: favorite doctor ? o3o
<AJIsAwesome> DoctoDoctorWho: I guess so. :D
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> They don't find it suspicious that the doctors are holding SEMI-AUTOMATICS?!
<otakon> SirGanjalf: no that's too simpel
<OJ> SWAT guys never shoot. Ever
<RaveBrony> I need a damn job
<RosePetal> Diamond Dogs.
<OJ> NVM
<otakon> DERPDERPDERPDERP: it's really dark they can't tell right off the bat
<mitamaking> Get down
<IcY_> too soon
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat music
<DoctoDoctorWho> spiritwaffle: 9th, the badass one.
<Whistler> Docter Whooves is in the house! :3
<spiritwaffle> DoctoDoctorWho: oki o3o
<AlienWarhead> otakon lol bat
<otakon> DERPDERPDERPDERP: plus atm more concerned with the guys that LOOK like they have guns
<CK|Ded> According to the SWAT video game, no one ever gets shot in SWAT raids. *nod*
<Shizuka> 13previously on the love boat
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> otakon: True
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh yah guys, I'm not gonna be here for Euro BMN. Going to visit my parents for the weekend.
<Barbetos> Wouldn't that of been awkward if he missed with some of those sticky bombs?
*Meanwhile on the boat...
<RaveBrony> o_o
<spiritwaffle> DoctoDoctorWho: myself i have to go with david tennant
<RosePetal> I will do it.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Shizuka: haha
<Pale_Horse> DOO EET!
<otakon> Barbetos: he doesn't miss, he's THE BATMAN.
<CK|Ded> A real officer takes down the entire enemy contingent with just a tazer
<Darf14> Tell the SWAT that the doctors are bad..... nah lets fight them >=)
<AlienWarhead> DoctorDoctorWho Yes he is my favorite doctor tooo
<twilight_sprinkle> and what if joker set it to their own boats, i could imagine him doing that
<otakon> Darf14: not enough time
<oneoneeighteight> only because they haven't LET THEM BLOW YOU UP
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> We should recreate this experiment between ponychan and 4chan.
<RosePetal> HE WONT BE ABLE TO SAVE THEM.
<DoctoDoctorWho> AlienWarhead: you do know how to use tab right?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: IT IS LESS INTERESTING IN THAT CASE AND NOT AS FUN. Besides The Joker is trying to PROVE A POINT.
<OJ> How do you ambush a SWAT team? Isn't their job to apprehend traps?
<Barbetos> otakon he is not the bat man. he is Christian Bale dressed up like Batman
<Lunac> RosePetal it;s Batman he will
<Spectrum_Rush> RosePetal: you were saying
<CrimsonPhoenix> DERPDERPDERPDERP, OH GAWD
<RosePetal> Never mind.
<pony_300> this is such an awesome setup, the clowns are hostages, while the doctors are the killers
<otakon> Yeah right
<OJ> Keystone Kops
<Lunac> No he;s not
<Barbetos> Snipe him now!
<RosePetal> What the batman what if they die?
<RaveBrony> :D
<mitamaking> DERPDERPDERPDERP: But Batman is not real, we would be toast
<CK|Ded> Stupid SWAT officers are stupid
<otakon> they do NOT know The Batman
<SirGanjalf> Pinata time!
<RosePetal> Never mind, they not ded.
<AlienWarhead> DoctorDoctorWho Excuse me?
<otakon> CK|Ded: no The Batman is just that much better is all
<OohShiny> rai.ing kill?
<OohShiny> railing kill?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> mitamaking: Hm, that's right. I wouldn't like our chances.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: no i mean he told them that they can blow up the other ship, but actually its their own ship. seems pretty interestign to me, and hed prove a point to the other ship
<Meanwhile> Save the clowns, shoot the doctors.
<Darf14> Batman > SWAT ....and the army
<Everlasting_Joy> Woof.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: no he wouldn't
<pony_300> PAWNCH dog
<Whistler> DEATHINATOR.
<pony_2854> FUCK YOUR DOGS
<OJ> Where's the lozenges?
<RosePetal> No, Joker has Hyennas.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: besides not as interesting that way
<SirGanjalf> His dogs are HUNG RAY!
<Everlasting_Joy> Bat-Man has serious trouble with dogs.
<Kandarihu> How do we know that all the clowns are hostages? I'll bet some of them aren't.
<OohShiny> release the hounds
<pony_2854> UFC CHAMPION
<mitamaking> Dogs>Batman
<whysoserious> if they were really smart they wouldve mixed some of the doctors to be clowns and some to stay the same
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: he would and it seems pretty interesting to me.
<Xaiden> He punched a dog down an elevator shaft, BADASS
<Darf14> Dogs! Batmans weakness!
<Shizuka> 13can't make the audience think too hard Kandarihu
<Meanwhile> You ever see a dog befriend a bat?
<princess> OohShiny: simpson line :P
<LunasGuard> debo
<DoctoDoctorWho> AlienWarhead: just type in the first 1-3 letters of a persons name and it will complete it for you
<RAWRity> once
<Forgottencrow> DEBO MAD
<RosePetal> I will do it.
<magmablock> Is that Michael Clarke Duncan?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: well maybe since neither go off we'll never know
<Everlasting_Joy> Meanwhile: Good point.
<RAWRity> they sang a song together
<otakon> BEST PART
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> oh boy
<MrBen> otakon: Looks like you were right. System hiccups and all. It's been working for the past several minutes.
<RosePetal> Is that Clarke?
<Barbetos> twilight_sprinkle there is a batman in ponyville video, and batman calls Twilight Sparkle twilight sprinkle XD
<Sylandest> magmablock: yes
<CK|Ded> It's Big John.
<Shizuka> 13john coffey gonna take it back
<Sylandest> thats him
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: y u spoil >:I
<mitamaking> Tough black guy time
<Nyst> He's dead :(
<otakon> Nyst: yeah sadly
<RosePetal> I thought it was Michael Clarke Duncan.
<Lunac> It';s always the big black guy that is the most noble
<spiritwaffle> love this scene o3o
<magmablock> The go-to actor for "Freakin huge black dude"
<otakon> Lunac: agreed
<Fluttercry> 05,15Sadly it isn't
<RosePetal> I volunteer as tribute.
<twilight_sprinkle> Barbetos: o.o i actually got my name from a dif video lol. can has link after movie?
<oneoneeighteight> dat black guy
<pony_300> Give the detonator to Deebo
<Fluttercry> 05,15It's like they WANTED to get him, but they couldn't
<LunasGuard> that alot of blood
<SirGanjalf> Yeah, crew and guards too, asshole?
<mitamaking> What about the cops on that boat?
<otakon> magmablock: no anymore and that wasn't Micheal Clarke Duncan
<RAWRity> that guy looks like he missed the casting call for Green Mile
<OJ> SYMBOLISM
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: [COMIC SPOILER COMIC SPOILER COMIC SPOILER] The camera angle shooting up at The Joker as he beats Batman with a pipe is reflective of the graphic novel scene in the Batman series 'A Death In The Family', in which The Joker kills SPOILERRobinJasonToddSPOILER with a crowbar.
<Tovler> "all we did was steal"
<CK|Ded> "They chose to murder and steal." Says the guy about to murder hundreds
<OJ> Or something
<AlienWarhead> DoctoDoctorWho: Thanks I don't know most of the chat tricks
<Whistler> WHEN IS THIS EVER GONNA END?!?!?!?
<Spazturtle> Its the detrnator for there own ship
<otakon> All the old familiar places
<DoctoDoctorWho> AlienWarhead: you new?
<RosePetal> It's almost done I think.
<Buytoast> and now they'll never get Micheal clarke Duncan to play a role again
<Meanwhile> Indeed.

<Appleshines> Blind as a bat now.
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: it's black Gouda

<Shizuka> 13how do keys work...
<ASoftFluffyThing> And heere we go
<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: That what i was saying - that would be a great practical joke. Strange nobody on the ferries didn't thought about that.
<Yahooz> ohey Everlasting_Joy ^_^
<BroPony|MEDIC> Just proves everyon has the mouth to talk all big, but when they have to step up and do it they're suddenly silent and butthurt
<Xaiden> DON"T

<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: not ALL of the inmates are murderers
<Shizuka> 13is it the amber lever or the silver one i'm confused

<RosePetal> *Stares intensily*
<spiritwaffle> silly white guy
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ""Karma Gained""
<pony_300> sometimes I wonder what deebo's reasoning was here; being righteous? Not trusting the possibility that they might blow themselves up? Not playing Joker's game period?
<twilight_sprinkle> dayum

<LunasGuard> RosePetal: lots of blood on one
<CK|Ded> And Joker's like "....dafuq"
<RosePetal> oH never mind,.
<SirGanjalf> Joker is dissapointed:(
<Lunac> Actually all those inmate cause hell in the Dark Knight Rise when released from Blackgate so killing them on the ferry would have been good.
<otakon> Joker is disappoint
<Meanwhile> I don't know why you keep giving Atrus jobs when he can't manage anything.

<Darf14> Sorry Joker, but im not recreating that ending from the first Batman Film
<Big_macinsocks> Didnt the joker die in aprevious Batman movie by fallign off abuilding?
<Buytoast> the burton one
<RosePetal> Yes.
<Lunac> Like Rhas Al ghul in Begins he didn't kill Joker he just didn;t save him from SWAT
<SirGanjalf> And that's why Ledger's Joker beats Nicholson, imho
<otakon> Big_macinsocks: eeyup and averted
<Meanwhile> And now Philosophy with the Joker.
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Joker's fall down the tower at the end of the film is a callback to Nicholson's Joker's fall in the original BATMAN.

<therainbowvortex> im back everypony
<Pale_Horse> Total Kismesis. :D

<RosePetal> THESE CTIY IS FULL OF PEOPLE.
<CK|Ded> I think Christian Bale ran out of breath for that line
<Shizuka> 13maybe you should get in on it
<Squallken> love that line
<J_E_Smith71> But since Ledger died and the trilogy's over they wouldn't be doing it forever
<otakon> lol
<SirGanjalf> Hello moon. Hello MOON. Hello Starrrrrr...
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Fluttercry> 05,15Wayne...listen...It's hard to take you seriously when you sound like that.
<otakon> Shizuka: dammit I spit out my tea at that :P
<Fluttercry> 05,15Just keep being cool
<RosePetal> Sad that the Joker and Heath Ledger died.
<OJ> Cable snaps
<otakon> RosePetal: agreed
<mitamaking> I thought you didn't do plans Joker
<otakon> OJ: it can hold The Batman it can hold The Joker
<Azuredragon> All it takes...is a little push
<twilight_sprinkle> lul
<SirGanjalf> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<BroPony|MEDIC> FUCKING
<BroPony|MEDIC> GLORIOUS
<RaveBrony> Hahahaha
<Kinixys|afkish> Best.. Joker.. ever.
<otakon> Indeed
<twilight_sprinkle> damn, that joker's excellent
<LunasGuard> this why I like the joker
<Darf14> The camera man has to be upside down for that shot
<RosePetal> HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH. How do I get down now?
<oneoneeighteight> and lols were had
<taoumi> dat joker
<Lunac> Officially this SWAT teM KILLS THE JOKER
<mitamaking> Poor Gordon
<SirTornado> dat joker
<pony_300> funny that while the flip Joker's scenes while he's hanging up side down, I still feel like I'm watching him upside down
<CK|Ded> mitamaking: That's part of the character. It makes you wonder how much of what he says can be taken at face value, since he CLEARLY plans a lot of what he does.
<Everlasting_Joy> Got a Dent problem? Try the DingKing!
<otakon> Lunac: is that what they're going with?
<RAWRity> and then we never saw him again
<CK|Ded> That combined with the constant lies about "how he got these scars".
<spiritwaffle> dent the derpy dentist
<otakon> Lunac: is it canon?
<RosePetal> Don't do this TWO FACE!
<OJ> This movie has a really good Rifftrax
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Director Chris Nolan intended Joker to appear in a cameo or at least be mentioned in Rises. However, due to Ledger's death, all references to the character were removed as he considered it was dishonorable to Ledger's memory. (I completely disagree.)
<Kandarihu> I wish he weren't flipped for that monologue
<Shizuka> 13it really does
<Xaiden> pony_300: It's because of his jacket
<Fluttercry> 05,15and the next movie just acts like he didn't exist
<Lunac> OTAKON YES LIKE IN bEGINS bATMAN DIDNLT SAVE al Ghul.
<twilight_sprinkle> dat lighting
<RosePetal> Dat true Silverscreen.
<pony_300> Xaiden: ahh, good point
<otakon> Shizuka: so Rifftrax tomorrow for Euromovie night?
<OJ> Dichotomy-cam
<princess> what did i miss? ;)
<RosePetal> Where is their daugther?
<Shizuka> 13yep cause a single character in a single movie is worth more than an actor's entire career
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: SHould we have the rifftrax for tomorrow?
<pony_300> then you have my permission to DAAAI
<twilight_sprinkle> and den you can see his ugly side
<CK|Ded> Silverscreen: The easiest way they could have referenced him? Claim that the Joker had gone catatonic, like he did in the comics when Batman "retired"
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, and ruin the experiance to europe people?
<Kandarihu> Oh, so Ledger died before Rises was finished?
<otakon> Lunac: I know that and not SWAT, an impending crash/explosion that killed him.
<RosePetal> Don't hurt them!
<LunasGuard> there his little girl
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: it'll enhance it
<Lunac> rifftrax of the Dark Knight blasphemy
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Ledger died a while ago.
<Shizuka> 13ledger died before the oscars for dark knight iirc
<Nittany_Discord> I think a mention to the Joker would have been nice.
<AJIsAwesome> DAMN
<Tovler> wimpering like Minnie Mouse
<mitamaking> Ledger died because of this role
<AJIsAwesome> THat's sucks.
<SirGanjalf> Silverscreen: I agree. Character that influential should be at least mentioned.
<Fluttercry> 05,15I think he died before this was released
<OJ> Lunac: No movie is too good for Rifftrax
<shogipony> mother f er
<otakon> brb
<RosePetal> Ledger died before Dark Knight Rises even began producing.
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, what if some people in Europe doesn't want rifftrax
<MrBen> Kandarihu: Ledger died during post-production of TDK, as far as I know.
<RAWRity> "Ha ha, Daddy loves me best! :p"
<BroPony|MEDIC> Fluttercry: One day b4
<Lunac> otakon Doesn't matter what killed him it;s the fact Batman didn;t kill him just didn;t save him
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Fluttercry: I was going to say, I think he did too.
<mitamaking> And Eckhart's performance>Ledger's
<Shizuka> 13now they abuse the lighting to save money doing dent's CG
<CrimsonPhoenix> rifftrax is good and all but you do not need rifftrax in everything
<Lunac> OJ This film is.
<Silverscreen> 01,11Shizuka: How would referencing one character harm his career? ESPECIALLY when it was one of his greatest characters he ever acted as.
<princess> dat police dog
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> buffer
<Darf14> Batman: Dogs.... why does it have to be dogs? :(
<RosePetal> SCARY FACE.
<Meanwhile> FAIR ARE THEY.
<Kandarihu> MrBen, oh, okay.
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Medical Research shows that Two Face could not survive more than a couple of hours in that condition (mainly from the infection he'd get from having so much underflesh exposed). However, the reason given for surviving so long is due to his adreneline rush for revenge. After the scene at 250 52nd street, Dent would have died anyway. The only really unrealistic
<Silverscreen> 1,11aspect is his exposed eye remaining so clean and uninfected.
<RosePetal> It's not FAIR!
<Barbetos> yogh don wan tah huwt tah boey havey
<OJ> CrimsonPhoenix: That's true. I draw the line at rifftraxing a rifftrax
<Darf14> Rifftraxception
<RosePetal> We Threee.
<taoumi> go go probability
<mitamaking> Because Joker lied about the locations!
<shogipony> lifes not fair harvey
<twilight_sprinkle> dat voice makes this so silly
<RosePetal> Because youse was the bessst of us.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Yeah... the doctors in Gotham seem as incompetent as the cops.
<Pale_Horse> And Man was he right! :D
<Shizuka> 13so he points it at gordon's family
<RosePetal> Joker lied.
<RosePetal> NO.
<OJ> Anyone else hear Beethoven in the score?
<Shizuka> 13and batman's dead
<princess> dat coin >_>
<Darf14> 9999 DMG
<MrBen> I'd leave because of the constant refreshing I'm having to do for this movie but since it's so close to the end of the movie anyway...
<Rosfox> ded
<Shizuka> 13movie over
<RaveBrony> Well
<SirGanjalf> Knight fall...
<AlienWarhead> Silverscreen I guess using acid makes more sense than fire
<Xaiden> Shizuka: YAY
<donutpop365> Watching batman I see?
<Meanwhile> If he died then how was he going to flip for Gordon.
<RosePetal> He's gonna commit sucicide.
<Nittany_Discord> Batman dead? No third movie!
<otakon> Meanwhile: he wouldn't
<AlienWarhead> donutpop365: Indeed
<RosePetal> RELEASE THE CHILD.
<princess> NOO
<princess> REALSE HIM
<weeping_pegasi82> the music
<donutpop365> LOL this is a cam.
<spiritwaffle> WELCOME BACK otakon
<otakon> Lie to him
<Meanwhile> otakon: Exactly, which is pretty poor thinking.
<Tovler> Batman would later return as Batman the White
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Did he really think a single shot to the gut would kill BATMAN?
<pony_2854> False, there actually is a third movie, so he's alive
<Everlasting_Joy> Kick him in the nads and run!
<LunasGuard> that tense music
<RosePetal> Son is tramatized.
<SirGanjalf> damn, that's dark..
<otakon> Tovler: lol
<Xaiden> But he's the one who got heads
<princess> LIE >_>
<Yahooz> Blasphimal no we will not let him go
<BroPony|MEDIC> one measily bullet is not enought to kill BATMAN
<otakon> SirGanjalf: yes it is
<Shizuka> 13die is called as it falls
<awesomes8wc3> :P
<pony_300> surprised that Dent never thought about Batman wearing bodyarmor
<otakon> GLOMP
<Barbetos> Batmang broke da rulz!!
<mitamaking> Kind of anti-climatic though
<Darf14> Heads.... That Battackle was useless
<RosePetal> Did you think this would kill me!?
<otakon> pony_300: nobody does
<Barbetos> He broke his no kill rule!!
<RosePetal> Two face is ded.
<Meanwhile> Nope, death by twenty feet.
<Lunac> That boy still has the batarang from Batman Begins too
<otakon> Barbetos: it was accidental
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Batman, y u still killing people?!
<mitamaking> I really thought Harvey lived
<OJ> Quick switch their clothes
<Darf14> Batman ...Killed :O
<Lunac> Get away from th edge kid
<BroPony|MEDIC> HA not even a fall like that could stop BATMAN
<thelonepony> two deaths for the price of one
<otakon> mitamaking: me too Bruce surived but why not Dent?
<Barbetos> otakon yet you can still go to court and serve jail time for accidents. its call man slaughter.
<weeping_pegasi82> kid falls anyway
<Lunairetic> so this is how it feels like when i drop people off buildings
<otakon> Barbetos: true
<princess> he just needs to play dead
<RosePetal> Cuz I don't know.
<RaveBrony> :D
<pony_2854> .fuck.
<pony_300> well batman did survive a much higher fall earlier, though it was onto a car
<Silverscreen> 01,11Personally, refusing to acknowledge Heath's last and greatest role in Rises was more of an insult than anything. Acting as if the Joker character didn't exist in the sequel was not only stupid, but it made it feel like the role wasn't important after TDK.
<Lunac> otakon he hit the weaker side of his head.
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I'm guessing the suit absorbed most of the impact.
<J_E_Smith71> otakon: Because he's Batman and can't die because he's the hero?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> pony_300: Wouldn't landing on a car make things worse?
<otakon> Silverscreen: agreed
<OJ> 5?
<donutpop365> Hey Kammerjunk and AJIsAwesome, here as promised, a little late though... I've seen this though :P
<RosePetal> Yeah, why did they kill Two Face?
<AJIsAwesome> donutpop365: YAY!
<mitamaking> Just say Joker killed them
<otakon> Silverscreen: maybe they'll add something to it in the extended home release
<AJIsAwesome> donutpop365: Nice of you to make it. :)
<otakon> OJ: that Harvey personally killed
<pony_300> DERPDERP: I would think the buckling roof would break the fall, unlike falling onto straight ground
<CK|Ded> Silver: Agreed. I strongly believe they should have claimed he went catatonic after Batman's "retirement". That actually happens in the comics and fits the character brilliantly.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, there wasn;t much point
<Squallken> I never got this ending, its like they treat the citizens of gotham as if they are stupid and cant face the truth
<twilight_sprinkle> ...lol i just cant take that voic seriously
<Barbetos> ah did all thos thangs
<Tovler> Kinda like Joe Paterno
<OJ> otakon: How did Gordon know about them?
<magmablock> CLOSE YOUR MOUTH DAMMIT
<mitamaking> I think Joker got executed, it makes sense
<Pale_Horse> And the police... Just buy it... No considering that Batman dosen't have a motive, or follow up detective work, or examining the scene for evidence... They just buy it... :|
<ASoftFluffyThing> Goddayn Batman, take a fucking Ricola.
<RosePetal> I always thought that most of the citizens of Gotham were kinda stupid.
<otakon> OJ: Harvey told him
<mitamaking> No Bruce!!!! :(
<RosePetal> Most of them.
<Meanwhile> You either find some throat medicine, or you live long enough to start talking like this all the time.
<CK|Ded> I'm Batman, and my voice is channeling the Bear Spirit
<Fluttercry> 05,15Not the hero we deserved, the hero we needed
<MrBen> Man, to HELL with this. Now the player won't even effing CONNECT.
<Darf14> RIP Bat signal :(
<otakon> The hero we needed
<donutpop365> Ok so this is a cam, why do the people's heads look weird?
<RosePetal> NO BAT SIGNAL!
<Shizuka> 13why didn't you turn off the light first....
<Rosfox> :(
<RainbowGuy> Squalken if they couldn't guess that the guy with all the super-tech was a rich guy and guess that the only rich guy in the city was therem then they are stupid
<mitamaking> Now him retiring ruins the end of this movie
<awesomes8wc3> screw batsignals
<Nyst> The axe was a little over the top.
<Ryunosuke> Sumerpan is is the hero that bronystate neeeds!
<donutpop365> Wait, is this a FAKE cam?
<CK|Ded> Shizu: Because SYMBOLISM
<pony_300> come to think of it, how they kinda wash all this under the bridge in the 3rd movie is kinda disappointing.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: it was just symbolic
<otakon> Shizuka: not symbolic enough
<Barbetos> Bow tie!
<Xaiden> Shizuka: CUZ THEY DONT GIVE A FUCK
<RosePetal> Everyone left.
<inkBot> "Ah Hihe hoe hehh. ho hill hun mih" is all you hear when bats is "talking"
<otakon> and fried
<whysoserious> i killed those people >_>
<Nittany_Discord> Overload!
<AJIsAwesome> Ryunosuke: How did the Sumerpan thing start?
<otakon> and thus Lucius stayed
<Rex_Ivan> Nyst: doing it up old school prohibition style
<twilight_sprinkle> No, I killed all those peopl! <_<
<mitamaking> See the device breaks, that is why Lucius stays
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> pony_300: Hmm, good point, I'm not sure. I was thinking all the broken glass would make things worse. All I can picture is the guy from The Untouchables.
<RosePetal> Where's he going?
<pony_2854> brb batcave
<CK|Ded> Which is idiotic.
<Shizuka> 13our top story tonight, hundreds of thousands of phones spontaneously explode all over gotham
<therainbowvortex> whysoserious: i killed lots of people
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, Nittany_Discord misspelled Superman's name.
<taoumi> bamanbaman
<otakon> lol
<Yahooz> bahman!
<Silverscreen> 01,11Sqallken: you don't know how the justice system works. One flaw in the prosecution could fuck up an entire case, and since Dent was responsible for 90% of the mob force being on trial, that's 90% of the criminals in Gotham running the risk of being let go.
<Darf14> Very good Batman Film .....the third movie..... well.... mixed feelings on it
<Pale_Horse> Mare-Do-Well is the hero that Equestria needs, but not the one that it deserves... Man is she not the one it deserves... :(
<RosePetal> DOGS BATMAN'S WEAKNESS.
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Okay.
<taoumi> i'm baman
<CK|Ded> It basically shows that Lucius only cared about being moral to a very limited degree. >_>
<RosePetal> Kid is the smartest of all of them.
<cachi01|phone> dat moment when you find out that soarin is Ed
<taoumi> i'm piderman
<otakon> Darf14: yeah but it's still good however
<Lunac> Same container park as Begins
<pony_300> Batman is Itachi
<AJIsAwesome> Demopan?
<pony_300> except this makes alot more sense
<Xaiden> CK|Ded: Dont worry he can punch them down elevator shafts
<Silverscreen> 01,11They said this when the Mayor met with Dent.
<RosePetal> He is an anti hero then?
<Spectrum_Rush> HE'S BAMTAN
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Darf14: Same here. I loved the third film the most (mainly because of Bane) but quality-wise, it was the weakest of the three.
<Shizuka> 13a title drop
<otakon> He's a Dark Knight
<donutpop365> So, are the MLPs after A and B?
<Rustymeat> sick title drop
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_300: itachi ftw
<LunasGuard> a dark knight
<AlienWarhead> RosePetal I guess he is a cat person
<Barbetos> That awkward moment when batman gets caught instead of getting away

<Silverscreen> 01,11SILVERSCREEN'S REVIEW: The Dark Knight. What a movie. It's a film that just feels big. Everything is done on an epic and grand scale, and everything is giving that dark and gritty yet realistic edge. However, I do have some problems with it. The biggest being that it drags on for too long. The talking aspect is nice, but it gets a little grating how they have to explain everything
<Silverscreen> 1,11going on. Batman is a superhero and a detective first, the drama should come second. That said, however, I love the Greek Tragedy twist this movie gives, and if they just cut down HOW MUCH everyone talked in the second act, it would have been much stronger. 8/10.
<OJ> Bane was a good "Final Boss" type villain
<Nittany_Discord> Gotta love Sumi pings.
<SirTornado> Spazturtle: Walking into Oblivion (if I'm right)
<otakon> RAWRity: /me actions of holding my hand and kissing me, saying I'm awesome and sexy.
<Pale_Horse> We should totally check out the "How it Should have Ended" for this. :D
<otakon> agreed
<Squallken> Thumbs up for Hans Zimmer (guy who did the music)
<otakon> we should have a rule on Lesson Zero
<Meanwhile> Lesson Zero is Season 2's Party of One, of course it's overplayed.
<Everlasting_Joy> Fluttercry: Areed, S2 E3 and 4 are overplayed/overrated.
<donutpop365> When are the movies and episodes released?
<otakon> one showing every month at most
<SirTornado> Spazturtle Living in Oblivion*
<RosePetal> Hans Zimmer and Danny Elfman are best music.
<Nittany_Discord> Talking is fine Silverscreen. 10/10 from me.
<mitamaking> OJ: spoiler :wait he wasn't
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon: Same for Luna.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> OJ: Yeah, too bad the done goofed it up, but for most of the film he was amazing. The perfect antithesis to Batman.
<pony_2854> THUMBS ALL THE FUCKING WAY UP!
<OJ> JOHN WILLIAMS
<princess> fat thug XP
<Rex_Mundi> Hello Broystate! Im back!
<otakon> if it gets picked and it was already shown pick again
<spiritwaffle> wb
<otakon> hmmm I agree
<pony_2854> MY THUMBS CAN'T GO ANY MORE FUCKING HIGHER
<BroPony|MEDIC> RosePetal: John Williams?
<pony_300> hrrm.... Morgan Freeman(God) leaves Batman in this movie, and in the next he's practically eager to show Wayne his new toys like barely anything happened between them. Did TDK even exist anymore to them?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Rex_Mundi :)
<otakon> despite loving that Luna ep
<RaveBrony> Regardless of Rarity being my fav pony. Dragon Quest is my fav episode. Just the adventure in it.
<RAWRity> Lesson Zero's still the MOST overplayed episode though.
<otakon> agrred RaveBrony
<twilight_sprinkle> talking is fine for me also, it may have been 2.5 hours, but it sure didnt feel long
<AlienWarhead> hi Rex_Ivan
<pony_2854> IT'S LITERALLY TOUCHING THE MOON SRSLY LOOK OUTSIDE
<Everlasting_Joy> When "Luna" comes on, I leave until it's over. It's played that often.
<Eli> Silverscreen: yeah, but without everyone actually explaining Jokers actions, we would be confused as hay
<otakon> That's why I've been puttin it on my lottery
<RaveBrony> Now that i can vote again im voting for it :)
<OJ> Somebody said "Hans Zimmer and Danny Elfman". Left out Williams.
<Pale_Horse> he said he'd leave if Batman didn't destroy the machine. Batman DID destroy the machine, so he stayed.
<Rex_Mundi> Heu there, AJIsAwesome :$
<pony_101010101000101> next?
<mitamaking> pony_300: He doesn't leave him, the deal was if the machine stayed he would leave him, the machine got destroyed, he stayed
<weeping_pegasi82> this music is pretty good but not nearly as good as the How to Train your Dragon music
<OJ> I corrected them
<twilight_sprinkle> lol pony_2854
<RaveBrony> otakon: (\
<OJ> Also Alan Silvestri
<cachi01|phone> when my little pony friendship is magic starts being shitty then you have my permission to die.
<Rex_Ivan> greetings Alienwarhead
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm picking "Sleep". It's a severly underrated episode.
<Derpy_Hooves> i DREAD the next steven magnet visit
<Rex_Mundi> What movie did I just miss?
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_2854: might wanna see a doctor bout dem thumbs :P
<Fou_Lou> pony_300: where does he leave him? He said he leaves if wane leaves the cellphone thingy running and it gets detroyed in the end so no need for him to leave
<BroPony|MEDIC> Rex_Ivan: DK
<donutpop365> Dark Knight.
<OJ> Also Ennio Morricone
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Batman: TDK
<CK|Ded> pony_300: One of the problems I had with Rises is that aspect actually. Lucius shows a total lack of moral compass. "I'm leaving because this is unethical, but if you break it at a later date after it's served its purpose, then I'll stay"?
<RaveBrony> Sleep?
<cachi01|phone> Rex_Mundi, le dark knight
<weeping_pegasi82> Rex_Mundi: The Dark Knight
<Everlasting_Joy> Look before you sleep, S1E8.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Derpy_Hooves: That's... that's just you speculating, right?
<CK|Ded> Total bullshit, I'm sorry. Lucius shows no spine and no morality by doing that.
<RaveBrony> Oh!
<Derpy_Hooves> SHOO BE DOO SHOO SHOO BE Do
<RaveBrony> *derp*
<Eli> cachi01|phone: not wanting to be pessimistic, but that can't take more than 5-6 years
<mitamaking> CK|Ded: I think Fox knew it had to be used once
<kidzrul434> missed batman
<Derpy_Hooves> call upon the sea ponies when your in distress
<taoumi> xD OMG baman and piderman
<SirGanjalf> But (Why so)seriously: 9/10<3 - my 2nd favorite comic book movie
<Fluttercry> 05,15I've been picking Owl's Well that Ends well, even though I don't particularly like that episode either
<PassTheFuckingPotato> So, whats the B movie?
<Meanwhile> Elements of Harmony Part 2.
<shogipony> i'd likr racheal to come back as a hero
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> SirGanjalf: What's the first?
<donutpop365> Things at the bottom?
<AJIsAwesome> Derpy_Hooves: I actually like the seaponies. :S
<OJ> Fuck you I do what I want
<CrimsonPhoenix> SirGanjalf, what's your first?
<donutpop365> Not people/
<CK|Ded> mita: Which in turn reflects that the Joker had already won.
<weeping_pegasi82> SirGanjalf: what's your first?
<RaveBrony> Sure I have all the episodes on my comp. But i dont watch Dragon Quest becuz I want to see it in here.
<pony_300> CK|Ded: it would've been nice if they had perhaps addressed that just for the sake of closure
<kidzrul434> Hey bronies imagine if..... actually don't
<Pale_Horse> Yeah. The seaponies totally dropped the ball on that whole ferry-bomb thing. :|
<SirGanjalf> Watchmen
<Silverscreen> 01,11Twilight_Sprinkle: I'm just the opposite. I was into the film up until the scene when Joker was taken into custody. After that, it was talking, talking, talking, with only ONE real action scene, and then the climax hits and it doesn't give you time to breath. I just think the pacing was completely off due to how much exposition they felt they had to give.
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: 5-6 years is actually quite a optimistic guess
<Derpy_Hooves> helpful as can be ponies simply signal S.O.S
<Fluttercry> 05,15come to think of it, I only REALLY like most of the S1 episodes, for the most part the rest are rather meh.
<CK|Ded> mita: Ergo it runs contrary to the movie's core argument. >_>
<mitamaking> I thought when Rachel died they were going to make her Harley Quinn for a bit
<Rex_Mundi> Im going to watch some G1 MLP, anypony have an good episode to suggest?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, all of it?
<weeping_pegasi82> makes sense I guess but I've never seen Watchmen
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: yeah, told you "not wanting to be pessimistic". i look forward to it :)
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Have you watched the pilot?
<donutpop365> Jeez credits take forever.
<SirGanjalf> Silverscreen: Movie should end when Joker was escaping in police car:P
<Silverscreen> 01,11mitamaking: actually, after the hospital scene I was thinking Harley would be in the film as well, thinking the Joker might have kidnapped one of the nurses.
<PassTheFuckingPotato> Well, skip!
<Fluttercry> 05,15......I like trains
<mitamaking> CK|Ded: What is this movies core argument, chaos reigns, bad people can do good, good people can turn bad
<cachi01|phone> Rex_Mundi, a good episode? uhmmmmmm idk imo they are all bad
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: but the talking was so enjoyable, watching joker screw with their heads and use his knowledge of psychology, and it was demonstrated in the end that he was interested in it
<Rex_Mundi> AJIsAwesome: Yep! Also the 2nd special too, nd the movie
<RaveBrony> Meh, its just sad that I love watching pony eps when theyre on the Hub... but the other day when Lesson Zero was on... i turned off my tv :(
<Darf14> err...try watching the smooze movie Rex_Ivan *its the only one I know
<BroPony|MEDIC> :O
<OJ> donutpop365: You should watch the LOTR credits
<PassTheFuckingPotato> I want to confess something...
<spiritwaffle> xD
<AlienWarhead> Fluttercry I like Turtles
<Shizuka> 13seems more TDK's climax is the chicken scene on the street, after that it forgets what buildup is, suddenly remembers for the boat scene, then forgets to pay off
<Everlasting_Joy> RaveBrony: I'd of done the same if it's any comfort.
<cachi01|phone> PassTheFuckingPotato, what?
<Meanwhile> Well, I never watch the pony eps and the B movie looks like it could curdle milk so I guess I'll go play TF2 or something.
<Squallken> that intense noise :D
<RaveBrony> That ep is just... aah :D
<AJIsAwesome> ^:D
<PassTheFuckingPotato> I don't like MLP, i'm just here because a friend told me this site was streaming batman.
<PassTheFuckingPotato> I fucking love Batman.
<mitamaking> I still think Spiderman 1 my favorite superhero movie
<AJIsAwesome> PassTheFuckingPotato: Wel, that's okay.
<Ximlee> wtflarp?!
<RAWRity> Lesson Zero and Luna are so overhyped that, depsite thinking those eps are decent, I've kind of started hating them.
<Everlasting_Joy> RaveBrony: It's overrated, 'nuff said.
<shogipony> watchmen the movie is almost exactly the same as the graphic novel
<weeping_pegasi82> PassTheFuckingPotato: well you missed it
<AJIsAwesome> PassTheFuckingPotato: Not everyone is a brony.
<Eli> PassTheFuckingPotato: then you're still welcome here :)
<Kinixys|afkish> PassTheFuckingPotato: XD Hope you had fun!
<CrimsonPhoenix> PassTheFuckingPotato, is your friend a fan of MLP?
<Squallken> time for ponies
<RaveBrony> Mhhm
<cachi01|phone> PassTheFuckingPotato, did you enjoyed the movie?
<Derpy_Hooves> SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Silverscreen> 01,11Twilight_Sprinkle: that's true, but the Joker in the Animated Show and even in the original Batman movie did the exact same thing, only they managed it through their actions rather than their words.
<princess> whats next?
<Darf14> thats ok, fans and non fans of FIM are welcome :)
<Eli> PassTheFuckingPotato: but now ponies
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> mitamaking: I thought Spiderman 1 was the weakest of those 3 tbh.
<Derpy_Hooves> im going to die
<J_E_Smith71> Tank time
<Lunac> Massive tonal shift from TDK to MLP.
<pony_300> PassTheFuckingPotato: prepare for whiplash
<BroPony|MEDIC> PONIESSS
<OJ> Meanwhile...
<Rex_Mundi> PONIES!
<PassTheFuckingPotato> Holy shit, dings eveywhere
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> pony time
<SirTornado> PONIES
<Rustymeat> PUNIES
<Lunairetic> OHMAI
<Fluttercry> 05,15This fandom has a tendency to overdo things
<AlienWarhead> PassTheFuckingPotato: An episode is next if you want to try it out
<donutpop365> Why the things at the bottom?
<Meanwhile> OJ...
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> WORNG ORDER
<SirGanjalf> That's fine PassTheFuckingPotato, as long as you're not trolling
<Big_macinsocks> PONIES !!!
<thelonepony> PONIES
<ASoftFluffyThing> PONY TIME
<OJ> Czech
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Lunairetic> WOOHOO
<XylemTube> catgroove
<spiritwaffle> o3o
<Spectrum_Rush> Rex_Ivan: try fugitive flowers
<Lunairetic> WOOOO
<RaveBrony> ^^
<Nittany_Discord> Oh look. Lesson Zero.
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry kids, it's pony time!
<pony_101010101000101> lol ponies
<Big_macinsocks> Ponies need to sit down lower
<Everlasting_Joy> Or overlook the stuff they shouldn't
<mitamaking> DERPDERPDERPDERP: really, even 3 is better
<Ximlee> PassTheFuckingPotato: your forgiven but only because your beautiful
<Spectrum_Rush> woops
<RaveBrony> Amen, Fluttercry, amen
<donutpop365> Are there FAKE ponies sitting at the theater?
<CK|Ded> mita: Actually the core argument is summed up nicely at the end. To prevent chaos from winning, they had to resort to the same criminal behavior they were condemning. Yet they try to pitch it with a moral spin, even though that's nonsense.
<J_E_Smith71> You've switched the Pony eps around Sumi
<Appleshines> Wrong pony order.
<Rosfox> Ponies watching ponies
<XylemTube> Oh shit my favorite ep
<Lunac> Dark Knight to MLP in a split second talk about an attempt mindscrew
<spiritwaffle> love this episode soo much
<donutpop365> OH!
<Ponymatic> Metaponies
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> mitamaking: I kinda liked 3...
<AJIsAwesome> *sigh*
<Ryunosuke> Wait, I thought Wreks episode was the second one
<J_E_Smith71> Though I guess Lesson Zero following Dark Knight is better
<BroPony|MEDIC> aahhhhhhhh
<therainbowvortex> yess i love this epeisoed
<Barbetos> still cant stand the intro song
<Rex_Mundi> Time to Clo-... im mean, time for ponies...
<Silverscreen> 01,11inb4 france/friends spam
<cachi01|phone> PassTheFuckingPotato, not dings.. pings lol if u want to take a look at the series stay you might like it :)
<SirGanjalf> Lesson Zero after TDK? Brilliant!
<Darf14> Crazy Twilight time
<Ryunosuke> inb4 france
<AlienWarhead> Yo dawg....
<IcY_> not enough checklists
<RAWRity> Fluttercry: especially if those things involve making some character an innocent woobie victim for them to fantasize helping/getting thank-you sex from.
<OJ> They George Lucas'd the intro
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos: I know what you mean. :D
<donutpop365> Oh yeah, there's Applejack's hat :D
<Ryunosuke> damnit Silverscreen
<RaveBrony> Silverscreen: Imma do it now :3
<Squallken> this is a top 10 episode in my book :D
<mitamaking> I would like Spiderman 3 more if there was a Spiderman 4
<Fluttercry> 05,15and think that absolutely everything is amazing and nothing is bad ever.
<Lunac> Everyone suddenly turned the volume down when TDK ended
<RaveBrony> Fraaaaaaaaaaanceee!!!
<BroPony|MEDIC> Frieeeeeeeendsss
<Spectrum_Rush> Silverscreen: PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANTSSSSSSSS :S
<Ryunosuke> FRANNNNCE
<Rex_Mundi> Freeennzzz
<RaveBrony> Lmao!
<ASoftFluffyThing> FRIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEMDS
<Eli> PassTheFuckingPotato: you're still here? :D stay:|
<J_E_Smith71> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN
<Darf14> 3rd favorite episode for me :)
<BroPony|MEDIC> 5th Fav
<AJIsAwesome> Don't have a favorite episode.
<RAWRity> well, a lot of people, not just the fandom, have this weird relationship with the idea of quality.
<PassTheFuckingPotato> no bye lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Silverscreen: havent seen the original one, but if the animated one is the one that was streamed here a few days ago, then i think the psychology there was pretty basic, just him being nuts mostly. in this movie he really is defeating enemies with their own minds by talking, i thought watching such aggressive psychology was quite fascinating
<inkBot> i prefer this episode over may the best pet win so i'm pleased because i have to sleep after this and the lottery (if it is tonight)
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<OJ> Is it Ponyville or a mini golf course?
<Kinixys|afkish> PassTheFuckingPotato: This is a good episode. Check it out.
<SirTornado> Like 5th favourite to me
<weeping_pegasi82> awwww he left
<spiritwaffle> the clock is ticking twilight
<pony_300> goddamnit rainboy dash DOWN IN FRONT
<mitamaking> I thought Let the Best Pet win was first
<donutpop365> CUPCAKES!
<XylemTube> CUPCAKES
<Darf14> :O
<AJIsAwesome> No.
<SirGanjalf> SO SWEET AND TASTY!
<Nyst> Time for OCD.
<RaveBrony> Mhhm
<awesomes8wc3> she has OCD
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<princess> cupcakes :o
<Fluttercry> 05,15Remember that Luna's Lament cartoon? How bad it was yet everyone flipped over it all time?
<RAWRity> Like, for most people, they never seem to think anything could be middling, or average, or flawed but still entertaining. Everything either sucks, or it's a masterpiece
<Darf14> MUFFINS! .....wait
<donutpop365> DON't BE TOO HASTY!
<SirGanjalf> awesomes8wc3: totally
<pony_300> No I don't C
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Obsessive Cupcake Disorder
<awesomes8wc3> yep
<XylemTube> Horrible OCD
<CrimsonPhoenix> OCD
<mitamaking> OCD is a bad problem
<shogipony> rainbow dash anyone?
<Pale_Horse> You fail at cupcakes forever, Twi. :|
<Kinixys|afkish> Yes Twilight, that would bother me too!
<AJIsAwesome> PaladinDrakkenwolf: :D
<RaveBrony> Luna's Lament?
<J_E_Smith71> mitamaking: Maybe Sumi switched them around because it makes sense to have the epic pony ep follow something epic like TDK
<Barbetos> Its just 13 cupcakes twi. Get over it.
<CK|Ded> Daw. My kitty just curled up in my lap. :3
<Ximlee> oops twilight
<donutpop365> AT THE ATOMIC LEVEL!
<Ximlee> nobody gets any FREAKING ICING
<twilight_sprinkle> two twoiloight eps today then
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: fanmade animation thing. Rather blah
<awesomes8wc3> turn them into muffins
<RaveBrony> :\
<Fluttercry> 05,15Something like that I don't remember the name
<Lunairetic> she could've given the 13th one to spike
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<weeping_pegasi82> YAY! no icing!
<Nyst> BUT 13 ISN'T AN EVEN NUMBER!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> perfect
<Fluttercry> 05,15Most things fall into the middle catagory for me
<RaveBrony> I liked Fluttershy's Lament <3 never heard of Luna
<Crippler> wow, what a tard.
<RaveBrony> *Luna's
<twilight_sprinkle> donutpop365: bring the laser!
<Fou_Lou> you cant devide 13 by 6 oO
<Ryunosuke> down in front a bit :)
<pony_300> nice spike
<donutpop365> SWEET!
<J_E_Smith71> First crazed Twi face of the ep
<Everlasting_Joy> RAWRity: Yeah no kidding. It's either perfect or not, and if it's not perfect, it's blasphemy.
<mitamaking> Suddenly TAZ
<Shizuka> 13Fou_Lou: two for each mane six, one for spike
<pony_300> wait is this Lesson Zero?
<Kandarihu> He'll be feeling that later.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Oh wait this is Lesson Zero huh.
<donutpop365> twilight_sprinkle: Yep, the laser cutter or the CNC laser?
<OJ> FOU_Lou: You can in Z23
<RaveBrony> Fluttershy's Lament actually helped me to look up the show in the first place :D
<Pale_Horse> You know the point of a baker's dozen originally started as a way for the bakers to avoid charges of fraud, right?
<Darf14> ......it begins
<BroPony|MEDIC> pony_300: Eeyup
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I thought this was the time travel episode.
<AlienWarhead> pony_300 yes
<twilight_sprinkle> donutpop365: CNC
<Fou_Lou> Shizuka: so spike gets only one. it defies her own rules
<mitamaking> Suddenly nuts
<Shizuka> 13yes
<princess> u just had to say tht spike ...
<pony_101010101000101> FFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Eli> as much as i love that episode, i gotta go to bed. NIGHT GUYS :)
<Darf14> Sanity level: -5
<pony_300> fuck yes! Never watched this episode through
<SirGanjalf> Yeah, Spike, that's from writing sure;)
<BroPony|MEDIC> inb4 Tardy
<XylemTube> ALL OF THE WEEKS
<Shizuka> 13spike has a cupcake addiction
<Shizuka> 13it's for his own good
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Rex_Ivan> 13 is a perfectly fine number to divide by6
<Rex_Mundi> TUESDAY!
<AlienWarhead> Ask for an extension
<Spectrum_Rush> http://derpiboo.ru/102713 all from this one episode
<Fluttercry> 05,15Then I probably got the name wrong, anyway, there was a cartoon that had TERRIBLE voice acting, yet people flipped whenever it was on and acted like it was the best thing ever
<OJ> I put my calendar on the wall
<DoctoDoctorWho> me no like dis ep
<donutpop365> twilight_sprinkle: Sounds good, are you sure we shouldn't just make the cupcakes conductive and use the plasma CNC?
<LunasGuard> 24
<Darf14> not Tuesday! :O
<BroPony|MEDIC> DAT SUN
<Nittany_Discord> Sun is buffering.
<Fou_Lou> Rex_Ivan: but not if you want an Integer result
<XylemTube> This is the power of Trollestia
<SirGanjalf> TARDAY:O
<Shizuka> 13nissan
<Cypresswolf> Poor Spike - always taking Twilight's abuse
<Silverscreen> 01,11This episode alone proves that twilight's OCD.
<otakon> THE CLOCK IS TICKING!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Tuesday is now the second to last day of the week, huh.
<ASoftFluffyThing> You know what? I think I just realized that Twilight broke the 4th wall when she stated that she should write a letter every week
<pony_300> visual gag #1
<Rosfox> TARDY
<Big_macinsocks> Twilight on her bed.... sexy
<RaveBrony> O_o
<mitamaking> Ponies have 7 day week confirmed
<ASoftFluffyThing> Or possibly
<otakon> Silverscreen: she was always a BIT OCD but this time
<AJIsAwesome> Tuesday: My most hated day of the week.
<OJ> Why'd Spike go down there?
<J_E_Smith71> You send her a letter every week....execept for when the season's not going because you're not doing everything every week
<RaveBrony> I dont listen to much fan -made stuff sadly...
<otakon> She does Discord proud
<Darf14> Tardy! Worse than death!
<Rex_Ivan> but look at Twi getting worked up over an integer result
<spiritwaffle> the drama xD
<Kinixys|afkish> Twilight, this is serious!
<LunasGuard> and shes still not a queen
<otakon> OJ: because she was on the bed upside down?
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: huh, I always liked tuesday
<twilight_sprinkle> donutpop365: lets use BOTH!
<mitamaking> It would be the moon Twillight
<[Alpha-Trinity]> ...late..
<Everlasting_Joy> I suppose it's worth noting, at the end of the day, does anything anyone else says matter?
<Kinixys|afkish> You can't overthink this!
<Rex_Ivan> they beat them
<Ryunosuke> or she could have just you know, ASKED FOR AN EXTENSION :0
<Nittany_Discord> This has been me lately.
<BroPony|MEDIC> magic...Kindergarted :O
<Nittany_Discord> I'm so Twilight Sparkle.
<Shizuka> 13it's not demonstrated that list making is a compulsion, just efficient at ensuring things are done
<Spectrum_Rush> hey look alicorn filly, meh
<Darf14> The horror! THE HORROR!
<RaveBrony> Meh
<pony_300> visual gag #2
<donutpop365> twilight_sprinkle: Alright, sounds like a plan.
<SirGanjalf> ONE MILLION YEARS MAGIC KINDERGARDEN
<Kandarihu> If Twilight were OCD, she'd be sending a friendship letter, and forgetting that she sent it and send it again and repeat until she actually remembers that at least one was sent
<Cypresswolf> Because Teachers always have it out for their students
<ASoftFluffyThing> I mean, think about it. When S2 premiered, we had new episodes about every 2 weeks I think for a certain time
<Azuredragon> Dinky!
<XylemTube> J_E_Smith71: Maybe she dose. It would explain all of the scrolls Spike pukes up in Return of Harmony
<Fluttercry> 05,15It's okay RaveBrony, I don't watch ANY fan made stuff
<Shizuka> 13people like misusing OCD to mean any attention to detail
<J_E_Smith71> Guess Kindergaden sucked for Twi for her to be afraid of it
<AJIsAwesome> Notice the filly alicorn in the back.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Every new episode, frendship lsson
<spiritwaffle> no not kindergarten... TO THE MOOOOOOON
<OJ> Just cut out a passage from a Chicken Soup book
<twilight_sprinkle> i never make lists. ever.
<RAWRity> it's funny that the same night I'm watching TDK, somebody on my facebook makes a really stupid post on facebook about the Aurora DKR shooting.
<Azuredragon> yeah the filly Alicorn
<Crippler> just...just make something up Twilight.
<SirGanjalf> :C
<Pale_Horse> Listen Twi. When SPIKE is being the voice of reason, you should take stock of your situation. :|
<AlienWarhead> wait why are the mst3k pony still there?
<Fluttercry> 05,15people misuse a lot of mental disorders
<Ryunosuke> tummy ache? :p
<AJIsAwesome> Pale_Horse: Exactly.
<Kinixys|afkish> I would make lists, but it would take me all day to get it right.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: the cupcake bit was OCD though
<mitamaking> Oh Spike

<AJIsAwesome> inb4 she finds it
<pony_300> why would it be any place OTHER than the last place you looked?
<spiritwaffle> never fear twilight is here o3o
<Rex_Mundi> Too bad when rarity gets her hooves on gems it makes her outfits gaudy as buck.
<XylemTube> Yes, because you stop searching when you find it
<Fluttercry> 05,15My brain cannot process that
<Cypresswolf> Rarity can't find gems in ribbon with gem tracking spell - therefor Dark Matter
<RaveBrony> Ill admire good fan animation of the show
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gosh I love Rarity <3
<Spectrum_Rush> well I would certainly hope it was in the last place you looked
<RaveBrony> but it also scares me.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and her pout
<OJ> OW MY EYE

<XylemTube> CrimsonPhoenix: i would neevr have noticed...
<Kinixys> Twilight is like Batman.

<RAWRity> " dude he shot over 50 people... and killed 14 including a 5good year old.... its like the lady from Florida who drowned her baby and OJ Simpson ..... THEY ARE ALL GETTING AWAY WITH SHIT.... sorry ... i have alot of opinions"
<AJIsAwesome> KICK!
<OJ> Always bothered me that Rarity levitated scissors so close to her eyes
<AJIsAwesome> PAUNCH!
<Fluttercry> 05,15The only fan animation I really was like OOOOOOOHHH SNAP was that Pinkie Pie present short
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm trying to get away form Facebook.

<donutpop365> Aaha.
<Shizuka> 13fluttercry wasn't here last time i streamed music huh
<J_E_Smith71> Hire her if you have condemed property that needs to be knocked down
<[Alpha-Trinity]> I like the way Rarity speaks :P
<Kandarihu> I liked the rest of the carnage more than the Sonic Rainnuke.
<Rex_Ivan> the_rapist
<Kinixys> I like RD with safety goggles.

<[Alpha-Trinity]> Wonders why Twilight has not at least washed it if she cared about it so much
<Mozdoc> And Twilight Sparkle proceeds to destroy the world with a single spell.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Mind Control is Magic
<Fluttercry> 05,15I'd seriously like to ban Lesson Zero and Luna Eclipsed for a while
<RAWRity> So, I went through and corrected all of that FB girl's spelling errors. Her response? " Spelling in this case doesnt matter to be quite honest"
<XylemTube> <3 bonbon
<Fluttercry> 05,15dead serious
<Shizuka> 13and it's well established that a vanishingly small minority actually check if a movie is eligible
<Cypresswolf> Heroic Twilight
<AlienWarhead> I guess smartypants is the reason Twilight is shipped with Eeyore
<princess> smack :3
<Barbetos> Why not ask your brother for advice Twilight? No? Or how about that one pony who makes love! Cadence? No?
<Barbetos> Oh okay.
<RosePetal> Mind Control doesnt help at all.
<Randomnerd> Oy
<Meanwhile> But then, frankly, why do you think they'll read anything you put out?
<Big_macinsocks> Sexy Mac!!

<SirGanjalf> ONE MILLION YEARS MOON
<Shizuka> 13we start voting spongebob episodes instead
<Lunairetic> ;) XD
<princess> THE WORST POSSIBLE THING
<Reikim> Here's an idea. Only let them vote for one episode a week.
<Fluttercry> 05,15OKAY
<Kinixys> Poor Twi.
<Kandarihu> Princess Celestia used the Elements of Harmony to send Princess Luna to the moon. And she only did so as a last resort.
<LunasGuard> x4 zoom
<Conyst> Evening Bronystate
<Cypresswolf> Pinkie Pie, you shouldnt have seen Twilight in the first place
<Shizuka> 13only seasons 1-3 ofc
<Fluttercry> 05,15but only pre-movie episodes
<Nittany_Twilight> Some people submitted G1 eps.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hello Conyst
<mitamaking> Trady
<XylemTube> trolololololololololololololol
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Conyst :)
<Cypresswolf> OH, you mean the pony :P
<twilight_sprinkle> NOPE, NOT REALLY. TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: cuz she had to use the elements of harmony, It wasnt a given ability
<Lunairetic> IM YTRAD!
<Reikim> The second episode can be a random one from a list that gets shorter as you go through it.
<princess> her hair is fixed?
<mitamaking> Rainbow entrance
<Spectrum_Rush> dat Pinkie twi nuzzle
<XylemTube> She looks So PISSED
<Reikim> Basically you'd end up cycling through all 52 eps in a year.
<LunasGuard> let the trooling begin
<Meanwhile> If you're going to do it like that why don't you just remove episodes from the lottery entirely and just play them in order?
<pony_300> Cele's troll face is on maximum
<Crippler> Go away Celestia, no one like you.
<CrimsonPhoenix> dat BGm from a movie
<LunasGuard> cant spell today
<Reikim> And then, for the first ep, you could make the timeout on eps longer.
<Sinestro> 1 MILLION YEARS DUNGEON
<princess> :P 3
<princess> 2
<AJIsAwesome> Crippler: I like her. :S

<LunasGuard> *throws spike in water*
<donutpop365> What's next?
<Shizuka> 13there's a reason the intermission is 20 minutes
<SirTornado> B Movie
<Ryunosuke> inb4 +m
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Did they enslave Spike just to be their scribe? How do they have a written a language!
<awesomes8wc3_> did u notice AJ's eyebrows were doubled up
<EspyLacopa> Don't forget including a link to all these rules as well as what's been shown in the previous month (for ponies) or year (for movies)
<Lunairetic> ooo b mov
<AJIsAwesome> Spike DID have some useful advice for Twilight in this episode.
<Fluttercry> 05,15judging by the number of people that picked stuff that has been played in the last 6 months, a lot Meanwhile
<ASoftFluffyThing> inb4 Meanwhile is typing a Gondor joke
<SirTornado> Living in Oblivion is the movie, just in case you want to know
<twilight_sprinkle> Ryunosuke: lottery is tomorrow though ,i think
<Spectrum_Rush> +m is tomorrow
<EspyLacopa> If people have to hunt them down? They're not going to read them.
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: :D
<Kandarihu> Sumica, due to my misconduct earlier tonight, I think it would be for the best if my lottery ticket were invalidated. If my number comes up, please reroll.
<OJ> DISCUSS
<princess> did anyone noticed twilight hair went to messy to fixed
<Meanwhile> Exactly.
<Conyst> It feels good to be back on here.
<Randomnerd> I'm still amazed no one has yet picked Beauty and the Beast.
<Shizuka> 13that intermission 1.0
<donutpop365> How long is this Intermission?
<Mozdoc> Derpy's in the popcorn again...
<Rosfox> dat old intermission
<mitamaking> Kandarihu: What happened?
<XylemTube> I think that everybody should Vote for Idiocracy in the next Lottery
<Lunairetic> because Twilight is OP?
<Ryunosuke> why is it some weeks it friday, and others its saturday :p
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome: lolol
<Shizuka> 13ponies do not have to suffer through my abominable version anymore
<EspyLacopa> And the link -needs- to be on the same page as the survey.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Ye olde fashioned lottery intermission

<Cypresswolf> I wonder how you can write with a quill in your mouth - its a feather
<Dj_Cyber-4G> ELLO EVERYPONY!
<donutpop365> How long is this?
<Silverscreen> 01,11Next to Applejack, Spike is the most sane and logical of the characters in the show. Which is ironic considering he's one of the youngest.
<Kinixys> XylemTube: I will.
<Mitch> Mall tycoon 2 music
<Pale_Horse> IT"S SO SMOOTH I CAN'T TAKE IT!
<SirGanjalf> Living in Oblivion - Steve Buscemi is in it, so i'll watch it
<EspyLacopa> ie, when they're filling in their choices? Oh look, there's a link to the rules and such.
<Fluttercry> 05,15actually now that I think about it, I haven't sifted through pony picks yet...ugh, BRB time to mark all the Lesson Zero
<OJ> My Little Pony: Giving credibility back to the word "Twilight"
*Randomnerd picks "Beauty and the Beast" Every week.

<AlienWarhead> donutpop365: usually 10-20 minutes
<Lunairetic> gah im still suffering from hype from the next 2 best sisters
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, I liked your Intermission 2.0.....
*EspyLacopa picks Grave of the Fireflies.
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: I like your version actually
<Conyst> Spike has to be sane he lives with Twi.
<Rex_Ivan> HEY! What is this song? I like it
<otakon> Sumica: lottery tonight?
<Dovah> Kinixys: hes like 6 months at the very begining
<Rex_Ivan> soothig
<Meanwhile> Really, maybe you should just start playing the pony in order.
<mitamaking> Kinixys: Actually Spike is at least 4-6 years younger than Twillight and the rest
<Silverscreen> 01,11Lottery is tomorrow night.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Silverscreen: Bull, Pinkie is the most sane and logical character.
<Randomnerd> But, I got my B movie this week, so I shouldn't complain.
<Silverscreen> 01,11But I do have an announcement to make.
<otakon> Silver has an announcement
<Randomnerd> Meanwhile: Yeah, but then people will complain that weak episodes get played :-/
<otakon> hopefully not bad news
<Silverscreen> 01,11Fillies and Gentlecolts, Bronies and Mods. I regret to inform you that this weekend may be the last time that you see me in BronyState. I am graduating on October 2nd, and afterwards I shall be moving back home. Unfortunately, that means my internet will not only be limited, but also extremely slow. Therefore, I feel it would be best to resign from being a mod of BronyState.
<Reikim> They're going to bitch no matter WHAT happens.
<Meanwhile> People are complaining about episodes being OVERplayed.
<otakon> oh goddammit
<Randomnerd> Oh no!
<otakon> well that sucks
<Randomnerd> :(
<RAWRity> aw, but who will feed me random chunks of information about movies?
<otakon> We won't be hearing from Silverscreen for awhile
<Meanwhile> No matter what path you take someone will complain.
<Bjornfot> Aww...
<Silverscreen> 01,11It has been fun being a part of it for another glorious summer, and I was happy to get to know everyone and enjoy the fun times that this site has brought. I'm sorry to say that I haven't been able to be a part of all the programs that BronyState has branched into. I felt most comfortable with only being involved with the one aspect of the place that I helped create and helped nurture
<Silverscreen> 1,11into a fully successful and thriving community. That said, I hope that Bronystate continues to grow and expand into one of the greatest Brony communities online.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O.O
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> still it's not goodbye just a see you later
*NewSuperBronyU hugs Silverscreen
<Silverscreen> 01,11I see the list of names of everyone that is currently online. Many of them are unfamiliar to me, just as many I recognize from day one, and of course there are names missing that I really wish I could see once more to give a proper farewell. Thank you to everyone who has been with this site for as long as I can remember. Thank you to the mods who helped keep it running and keep it an
<Reikim> I rather liked SS's random movie facts.
<Silverscreen> 1,11enjoyable place to be. And thank you to Bronystate in general for being the best experience durring my college life. Thank you everyone.

<J_E_Smith71> Dang you dialup internet
<twilight_sprinkle> RainbowGuy: tis on the front page
<Reikim> What happened to Shizu's new-fangled Intermission cartoon thingamabob?

*Spectrum_Rush didnt even know dial-up was still in exitance
<d3rb> where was trivia when Silverscreen left :(
<Reikim> Whyyyyyyy
<RainbowGuy> It's not on the home page. The home page shows last week's movies
<Silverscreen> 01,11Dovah: actually, I'm already working on getting a job, but all the money I'll be getting will be used towards my car and school.
<Bjornfot> But... why? It was nice...

<Dovah> Silverscreen: Hmm ask the Brony Comunity to donate? :S
<Shizuka> 13it's hosted in the same place all the movies are
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> The B movie is some documentary-type movie about makinga cheap movie, I think.
<Meanwhile> Busted file?

<Conyst> A movie within a movie you say.
<Randomnerd> Yes! Yes! YES!
<Silverscreen> 01,11For what? So I can be a moderator? Nah, I'd feel like a leech taking advantage of the Brony community if I asked for money.
<Fluttercry> 05,15So.....Y no awesome intermission?
<RaveBrony> I wondered why it was the Derp Popcorn thing too. But seeing as how i came back late I figured the question was already asked.
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: stop trying to incite a mod war.
<RaveBrony> *Derpy
<Tovler> Will this as good as Adaptation?
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Don't need to there was one earlier.
<Nittany_Twilight> You threw away Intermission 2.0?

<Rustymeat> Does anyone wanna play Borderlands 2 on 360 with me?
<Fluttercry> 05,15this sounds like a MIDI file
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: They're most known for being cult classics.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> AJIsAwesome: Personally, some of my favorite films we've watched have been B movies.
<pony_300> damn, got back just in time
<Silverscreen> 01,11At least artists actually give something to the fandom that costs money, thus warranting them asking for donations, but it'd feel wrong for me to do that.
<Laurayne> I See
<Rex_Ivan> Silverscreen: I now raise my glass to you in a toast. In the hopw that you are able to do as you will in what you will. Good luck.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i actually have more ideas for b movie than a :P

<Conyst> bye princess
<Reikim> ^
<RaveBrony> O.o
<princess> PRINCESS ISH OUT*le pewf*
<Reikim> Such a good film.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14better choice
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Top Gun
<RosePetal> She has no memory.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm voting schindler's list
<Barbetos> She has no memory of saying that what so ever
<RosePetal> Hai mom.
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Mr Horse from Ren & Stimpy...oh wait
<RaveBrony> What if I chose "Spirit (yes, the horse movie)" for the lulz? :D
<Dovah> AJIsAwesome: k just makeing sure i answered it *mostly* right
<AlienWarhead> Holy crap princess is gone!
<RAWRity> Battle Royale is one of the best films of the last 20 years
<Reikim> ...Yeah Saxy, I'd rather teach these kids what Hunger Games could have been if it were more hardcore.
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i like spirit
<Barbetos> Do you always have to smoke mom? AUGH!!
<RaveBrony> I like it too, but the chat?
<RaveBrony> how will they react? :D
*Conyst coughs "to many smoke pellets"
<Randomnerd> Spirit: Good Idea, bad implementation.
<awesomes8wc3_> smoke outside
<RAWRity> Reikim: you should read the HG books. they get plenty "hardcore"
<Reikim> I have!
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Oh hey, Buschemi is in this?
<Reikim> I was making a joke.
<RosePetal> oooh shipping.
<Everlasting_Joy> It's Steve! He's possessed by Marik.
<Silverscreen> 01,11...is...is it weird that I literally smelled ciggarette smoke when the mother lit up?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity isn't that one the original hunger games ? or i'm gettin mixed here
<GilDash> Buschemi scares the crap out of me. In a good actor sense.
<Silverscreen> 01,11That was creepy.
<Barbetos> Silverscreen This movie is THAT good
<Sergio_Scriptor> GilDash: he is a genius :)
<Reikim> Something like that. HG wasn't really inspired by Battle Royale, iirc. It was just coincidence.
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Battle Royale is about teens killing eachother in an arena. That's about the whole of the connection.
<Silverscreen> 01,11FAIL!
<AlienWarhead> Silverscreen not really sometimes I do that with food
<Barbetos> Also the evil clown is standing right behind you. Don't turn around Silverscreen
<Randomnerd> Steve Buscemi, Dermot Mulroney and Peter Dinklage.
<RaveBrony> Well dang
<Kandarihu> Silverscreen, here's hoping there's broadband at your home when you get back
<GilDash> Sergio_Scriptor: He always seems to play the "freak" type characters as well. That doesn't help. XD
<Conyst> Did she say flame on?
<Silverscreen> 01,11You have yell either Striking or Flame On when turning on Production Lights on set. You know, so you don't f**king blind people!
*spiritwaffle hugs otakon
<Sergio_Scriptor> GilDash: true :D
<RosePetal> It's all in the manual.
<Reikim> I love both Battle Royale and HG. Really, though, they're not really comparable; they're both great, but on different terms.
<Barbetos> speeee
<AJIsAwesome> RosePetal: But no one reads the manual!
<Barbetos> cola!
<[Alpha-Trinity]> I like the flame on idea
<RosePetal> Suddenly COLOR!
<GilDash> I saw colour...
<Nittany_Twilight> Suddenly, color.
<Conyst> RTFM
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Damn one leaves for half an hour and a mod quits
<AJIsAwesome> DAT COLOUR
<OJ> That is a cool technique
<RaveBrony> :D
<spiritwaffle> OJ: agreed
<Silverscreen> 01,11Danny?
<Silverscreen> 01,11OH GOD, THEY'RE MAKING THE ROOM!

<Yahooz> Ohai Mark

<RosePetal> What a story mark.
<AlienWarhead> I definely have breast cancer
<doctor_whooves127> did i miss the lottery?
<Barbetos> Boom mic
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Is that Situation?
<Conyst> Run Away!!
<AJIsAwesome> doctor_whooves127: It's tomorrow.
<RosePetal> No, lottery is tomorrow.
<Barbetos> I totally did not notice it untill he said cut
<Everlasting_Joy> Boom mics. . . The enemies.
<doctor_whooves127> oh ok
<OJ> You think The Room is bad, watch Manos: The Hands of Fate
<VenHur> Hello everyone!
<RaveBrony> Lol
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, VenHur :)
<spiritwaffle> hi VenHur o3o
<AlienWarhead> hi VenHur
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> What's up Ven?
<pony_300> QJ: Bad funny I hope?
<Kandarihu> Oh. That's why we had the 10 minute intermission
<Nittany_Twilight> The Room is just boring.
<AlienWarhead> OJ we should watch that here
<I_NeverAskedforthis> derp
<OJ> VenHur: Have you ever seen BenHur?
<Conyst> Hello VenHur
<AJIsAwesome> I did not hit her, I didn't. Oh hi Mark.
<[wub]ehren> live in a black and white world and record in colour
<Appleshines> wtb did i miss?
<[wub]ehren> what
<thelonepony> hi VenHur
<Rex_Ivan> Nittany_Twilight: you thought so too?
<OJ> AlienWarhead: MST3K version preferred
<Reikim> IT'S ARTSY
<Nittany_Twilight> Yep.
<pony_300> The Room is the most hilarious bad movie I've watched yet. Don't touch me matherfaker.
<AlienWarhead> OJ of course
<Silverscreen> 01,11RANDOM MOVIE PRODUCTION TRIVIA: The clacker used in films is done to synch Audio and Video as well as synch the multiple cameras. It's very important in post-production.
<Xaiden> Hey this is an odd question but does anyone have Uncharted 3? I've been looking for a couple of people to play with since I just got a ps3 along with the game.
<VenHur> OJ: Finally, someone that understanded! Well, I heard of rhe movie, but no...
*Spectrum_Rush that feel when you can't remember if your B movie pic was legit or a troll choice
<Nyst> That voice...have I heard the guy in That's 70's show?
<Rex_Ivan> I think te ROOM is only good if you ridicule it with a giant group of people
<Pale_Horse> Sweeetie Belle: OH COME ON!!!
<Randomnerd> lol white rapper guy with the alarm clock.
<diddutz> all them "CUT"'s
<Nittany_Twilight> But that was part of the movie.
<AlienWarhead> Rex_Ivan thats it still sometimes shown inn theathers
<Barbetos> .. crrrckk yes
<AJIsAwesome> Brb. Bathroom.
<Conyst> I just sold my copy of it Xaiden
<OJ> VenHur: Me neither. But I own it and I'm gonna see it soon.
<AJIsAwesome> .nick AJIsAwesome|AFK
<RosePetal> Lets do it again this time with no distractions.
<AJIsAwesome> Waitt.
<Everlasting_Joy> Randomnerd: Flava Flav is going to sue someone.
<AlienWarhead> 6_9 I can't spell today
<Xaiden> Conyst: ._.
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> There we go. :D
<Xaiden> darn
<Silverscreen> 01,11To someone who's had experience or is interested in film production, this is actually quite interesting to watch. Also, it's quite realistic.
<spiritwaffle> xD
<Rex_Ivan> AlienWarhead: DUDE! do you know what your typo has invented? the "inn theater"
<Conyst> Xaiden: get Journey
<OJ> ...And Joey Tribiani as Dr. Drake Ramoray
<VenHur> So this is the B Movie. Correct?
<Barbetos> booooooooooooooo
<RosePetal> lol Booooooooooooooooooooom.
<Rex_Ivan> think of it ... like a drive in theater but with an inn
<Randomnerd> VenHur: Yar
<RaveBrony> This movie is pissing me off :D
<Reikim> I imagine the drama amongst the cast is just as realistic.
<AlienWarhead> Rex_Ivan lol I created Sumerpan's home base
<Pale_Horse> I have a better idea. GET RID OF WES.
<Buytoast> well shit
<RosePetal> No more boom da boom prop.
<Everlasting_Joy> RaveBrony: How so?
<Buytoast> my iced tea smells like rotten cabbage mixed with ass
<Barbetos> Wes is working for free.
<Barbetos> They can't afford anything else
<OJ> Stanley Kubrick would have had the scene 50 times by now. And he'd still be demanding more takes
<Pale_Horse> then he;s still overpaid. :P
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Buytoast: I wouldn't drink that if i were you.
<Buytoast> well it's not opened
<Tovler> Black Dynamite had no problem with boom mics
<Buytoast> just the can
<Buytoast> the cna smells bad
<VenHur> Don't know why they keeps changing black 'n white to colors and vice versa.
<RaveBrony> Everlasting_Joy: All the failure! :D
<Rex_Ivan> OK, so this is a movie about how people making movies suck?
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<Rex_Ivan> is that it?
<Barbetos> VenHur to show which is the set, and which is the actual film being made
<RosePetal> Kubrick I think would shoot it at different angles until he found one that is interesting.
<Randomnerd> I <3 this movie.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> VenHur: The film they're shooting is in color, the "actual" film is balck and white.
<RosePetal> ooooh rumors.
<Tovler> Michael Bolton? I love that guy
<RaveBrony> I dont even know the movie ._.
<OJ> Rex_Ivan: It's too early to gauge the ultimate point of the movie
<Mozdoc> I tried applying for some jobs at film studios considering I live in California, but that never got me anywhere or anything in return, and I'd stumble across a few from time to time.
<Everlasting_Joy> This movie is pretty good so far.
<Fluttercry> 05,15I'm....not sure how I feel about this. I'm very interested in filmmaking, but I feel like this is something I'd watch on my own one afternoon, not with a bunch of people
<Rex_Ivan> Rosepetal: and he would take it HUNDREDS of times
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Fluttercry: I agree, so far there's not too much to say about it.
<RaveBrony> Its just reminding me of a group video I had to do :D
<Tovler> A Showtime sitcom about making movies
<VenHur> You know, in mordern motion pictures, we sometimes doesn't have black and white movies.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so RD's winpose in Fighting is Magic is pretty hilarious
<RosePetal> What the!
<Christian_Bale> WUT
<Christian_Bale> LOL
<Barbetos> AAAAAHHH!
<AlienWarhead> Derp and somehow we made room jokes
<Reikim> Hey
<spiritwaffle> xD
<Reikim> Hey saxy
*ASoftFluffyThing slaps Hanako around a bit with a large trout
<Barbetos> my GOD!!
*RaveBrony esplodes
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This is true...
<Tovler> That's how Brandon Lee died :(
<Rex_Ivan> geez. how often does THAT happen?
<VenHur> I think I know one movie in black and white, It was an Oscar nominee, but I forgot the name of it...
<Kandarihu> I hear that in voice acting for animation, the VAs can be expected to do about a dozen readings of each line, and then it's decided afterwards which reading to use. Badly dubbed anime tends to go with only one reading.
<Pale_Horse> Then the fire nation attacked...
<RosePetal> Glad that everyone is ok.
*Barbetos starts crying
<Silverscreen> 01,11Rex_Ivan: I THINK it's supposed to show the realistic side to making films, particularly how much of a pain in the ass it can be when trying to film one scene just keeps going wrong.
<RosePetal> No... Bruce lee....
<SaxyPretender> 0,14?
<Conyst> Xaiden: what is your name on PSN so I can add you.
<Reikim> How upset are you that you can't be at Canterlot Gardens in that tourney?

<RosePetal> What if it's a ghost haunting the studio!
<pony_101010101000101> what we watching?
<Tovler> Manhattan or Schindler's List?
<Everlasting_Joy> Reikim: Not at all.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Tovler: Speaking of which, if my A film is picked we'll be watching The Crow. Perfect time of the year for that movie too...
<AlienWarhead> Kurra?
<Conyst> and then water
<ASoftFluffyThing> Also, I TRULY didn't mean to hit you, Hanako
<Reikim> I asked the man in the jacket.
<Rex_Ivan> Silverscreen: I wonder if they will actually finish the scene before the movie is over
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Very
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Very
<SaxyPretender> 0,14upset
<OJ> Making a film is like anything else. It requires highly specialized people and lots of hard work.
<Christian_Bale> dam granny swearing
<SaxyPretender> 0,14had I gone, I would have been representing BronyState
<RosePetal> Maybe the whole movie is them directing this one scene.
<Reikim> Don't worry man. I feel the same way :I
<diddutz> they're shooting this scene on Friday 13th, right?
<Reikim> *:/
<Tovler> The Warner Kids need to show up and put this movie down.
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> Rosfox: I HOPe not> :D
<Barbetos> Man the director is going to get hell about this all night
<SaxyPretender> 0,14no, I mean, like in a semi-offical capacity
<Meanwhile> That would have been neat Saxy. You could get a patch with the Bronystate logo.
<Reikim> And remember, I'm in a whole 'nother country.
<OJ> It is different from most other forms of art because it needs so many people to pull off
<Reikim> But yeah, Saxy
<AlienWarhead> OJ and lots of problems to go though
<Reikim> You would have been the best representative.
<RosePetal> BEGIN !
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>

<Meanwhile> Mm?
<[Alpha-Trinity]> lol
<Shizuka> 13we discussed pony episode voting
<spiritwaffle> xD
<otakon> what's up?
<RosePetal> We have jazz.
<Tovler> Michael Bay didn't like Jazz
<Everlasting_Joy> Aaaaand?
<Reikim> Where?
<otakon> hmmm?
<Shizuka> 13we have come to a decision
<spiritwaffle> lol
<Barbetos> da buffers!
<RaveBrony> Yeah?? :o
<diddutz> This "OMG all was just a dream" makes the Movie fucking dumb
<Shizuka> 13http://derpy.me/bronystatebacklog
<BerryPunch> Title on accounts.google.com (redirected): Welcome to Google Docs
<Conyst> Do you like smooth jazz?
<otakon> oh about showing the two most wanted ones
<Spectrum_Rush> what a baby
<RosePetal> MY EYE WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY EYE!
<Shizuka> 13all 52 episodes have been put into a shuffled bag
<Barbetos> it was only in the begining.
<RosePetal> Suddenly eye comes out.
<pony_101010101000101> dam
<RaveBrony> :O
<Shizuka> 13each week, the winners will be removed from the eligible list
<Silverscreen> 01,11Oh, hey, it looks like my car.
<RosePetal> How long is this movie?
<OJ> Is the driver Bane?
<Reikim> Ha! I totally suggested that further up
<Conyst> Your eye is completely gone.
<Shizuka> 13the remaining episodes are shuffled and copied to a dropdown box on the lottery
<Tovler> one shot. Ippatsu
<Reikim> I had a good idea! I had a good idea and it got implemented!
<VenHur> I think it's Alfred...
<Reikim> ...
<RosePetal> Idenity Crisis.
<Meanwhile> And I suggested removing the eps from viewer lottery, calm your pants.
<Spectrum_Rush> try getting the point of an umbrella through your I and call me tomorrow about you r eye :|
<SaxyPretender> 0,14inb4 first ep picked will be Party of One
<Christian_Bale> maybe he should act instead... oh wait
<Reikim> ...I feel so incredibly depressed now.
<Silverscreen> 01,11Why does this guy look familiar...?
<Shizuka> 13while this may introduce a bias towards episodes above the fold, and make it a little harder to find your favorite, that's balanced by having a different list each week
<Meanwhile> Party of One and Sonic Rainboom.
<Kandarihu> Well, ya gotta admit. That alarm was one epic dream crash
<RosePetal> Housekeeping.
<Christian_Bale> silverscreen hes played in alot of stuff, one of which is armageden
<Fluttercry> 05,15The driver?
<Shizuka> 13while season 3 will throw a bit of a wrench into the setup
<Dj_Cyber-4G> i gotta crash goodnight everypony
<Conyst> nice station wagon
<Fluttercry> 05,15or Steve Buschemi
<Shizuka> 13it would take six months to cycle through the episodes

<Nittany_Twilight> Chat can't handle nakedness.
<Reikim> Six weeks to be specific.
<OJ> Ted Bundy
<Meanwhile> Or "HAI GURLZ"
<Silverscreen> 01,11Holy Shit! He was in Grown Ups, G-Force, Igor, hell, he played Templeton the Rat in Charolette's Web!
<RosePetal> This guy looks like Michael Pitt.
<Fluttercry> 05,15party time!
<Randomnerd> lol
<Kandarihu> I can handle the nakedness. I just don't like it.
<Rex_Ivan> wait what?
<[Alpha-Trinity]> ....O.o
<Meanwhile> Still, when one of those shows up as the first picks out of that new system, I'm gonna chuckle.
<RosePetal> Pegasister all the way.
<Rex_Ivan> no no wait. Who played templeton the rat?
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: So each episode will take 6 months to go through now?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Huh, Templeton too?
<Shizuka> 13that's the idea
<RosePetal> As in good wack or bad wack?
<Tovler> I don't care about matter-of-factual nakedness
<Cypresswolf> Silverscreen: actor is Steve Buscemi - Phil Hickle on Pete & Pete, Rockhound in Armageddon, those ring any bells?
<AlienWarhead> RosePetal Brohoof
<Silverscreen> 01,11The Director in this movie. I wondered why he was familiar.
<Fluttercry> 05,15eeyup
<Everlasting_Joy> K
<OJ> I wish I was whacked
*Reikim rejoices
<RosePetal> *brohoofs*
<Silverscreen> 01,11Yeah, they do. No shit.
<Tovler> Bushwacked for B movie
<pony_101010101000101> :D
<RosePetal> PUSHUPS FTW.
<Rex_Ivan> Steve Buscemi was Templeton rat? are you sure?
<[Alpha-Trinity]> I don't forget faces but names come and go
*spiritwaffle hugs otakon
*Randomnerd did his push-ups today.
<OJ> Joe Tribiani
<Everlasting_Joy> Somehow I see this backlashing, but in that same breath, I'd enjoy six months without Luna.
<RosePetal> A kiss with nudity.
<OJ> Joey*
<Rex_Ivan> I thought that was ... someone else
<OJ> ...with nudity
<Tovler> Nudity, Rarity's sister nopony talks about
<RosePetal> She's kind of cookie? She's made out of cookies.
<Cypresswolf> Big Fish too - interesting
<Dr_Fumbles> Whoever doesn't know who Steve is clearly doesn't watch many movies. He's almost in as many movies as Morgan Freeman... almost.
<Unnr|Laptop> Tovler: O_o
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I didn't know that was Buschemi, I just know him as the woodchipped guy from Fargo and the pedo in Con-Air mostly.
<Shizuka> 13ponies whined about side rooms being closed during the week
<spiritwaffle> Tovler: you just won the internet
<RAWRity> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/564951_10151307557840802_1940431914_n.jpg
<Shizuka> 13then the interseason slump hit and no one cares
<RosePetal> I don't even know
<VenHur> ...I'm never getting that image out of my mind for the rest of the night...
<Nyst> I'm sure I know that guy from That's 70's show.
<RosePetal> Ointment.
<Reikim> They'll whine no matter what you do.
<Rex_Ivan> ALSO, he was Mr Pink in resurvare dogs
<Randomnerd> Try as hard as you might, it's gonna bite.
<Rex_Ivan> bad spelling
<Everlasting_Joy> Good point.
<RAWRity> that's this fandom in a nutshell, really. Whine. not complain. Whine.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Rex_Ivan: Right, right.
<Fluttercry> 05,15So uh...I'm going to post a video, don't yell at me, but it fits my mood right now about having this fixed http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA8W3y5Sk18&feature=player_detailpage#t=19s

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> He's in Boardwalk Empire too.
<Pale_Horse> But it's so smooth... :(
<Reikim> "I hate jazz"
<Tovler> Jazz is the most hated Bayformer here
<OJ> But Jazz is the father of Rockabilly
<Reikim> "I hate jazz"
<Reikim> HOW COULD YOU
<RAWRity> Like, anything at all doesn't go exactly their way, people shit their pants, smear the residue across their keyboard, then smash their face into the screen until their computer makes a high pitched whining noise.
<[Alpha-Trinity]> ...?
<RAWRity> ...that metaphor got away from me.
<Reikim> FC
<Reikim> What is that
<pony_300> I'm sure Mudflap and SKiddz are hated more. Bazinga.
<Meanwhile> Just a bit.
<Everlasting_Joy> RAWRity: I don't care, it's actually quite accurate.
<OJ> ...With nudity
<Reikim> What got said while I was out of this room for five seconds
<Fluttercry> 05,15Gospel Song I saw someone post during the Steam Summer sale. fits the mood right now

<Nittany_Twilight> All dressed up.
<Randomnerd> Anonymity tends to make people irresponsible.
<Mozdoc> Wolf. Serious cameraman.
<Christian_Bale> nope

<Tovler> Why is Wolf letting them do that? Its out of character.
<Silverscreen> 01,11...
<OJ> AlienWarhead: I see what you did
<Fluttercry> 05,15Do as I say not as I do! >:(
<Nittany_Twilight> Turn color back on! =p
<Christian_Bale> and now the filming... is in black and white
<Kandarihu> So now the movie is B&W while the crew is color
<Christian_Bale> da fuq

<Silverscreen> 01,11okay, can't lie, that's pretty clever. I see what you did there, movie. I see what you did there.

<Reikim> Did you enjoy your stay?
<Tovler> Troy Polamalu
<Mozdoc> I'm going to have to look that up now. What exactly is a "dolly"...
<Rex_Ivan> OJ: and this actor is a horses ass

<RosePetal> 4TH WALL.
<OJ> Mozdoc: Dolly: The first mammal to be cloned from another mammal
<[Alpha-Trinity]> *by
<Kandarihu> And I have a theory about this marathon. I think The HUB is using the ratings data from the marathon to pick a timeslot for Season 3.
<Mozdoc> Yes, that too.
<Reikim> The suppository bit always creeps the hell out of me.
<OJ> This is not professional Chad.
<Christian_Bale> chad, what are you doing?

<Rex_Ivan> ok THIS guy is just Purposely ruining the shot
<Kandarihu> She's been possessed by the champaigne? EXORCISM TIEM

<RosePetal> First rule in shooting a movie or play, never turn your back to the camerea.
<Rex_Ivan> and did anyone else notice that the BOOM man is dressed like he's going to a gay rave?
<RaveBrony> Yeah, lol
<Everlasting_Joy> I predict another "dream" like cut thing.
<OJ> RosePetal: True for the stage too
<OJ> Have a KitKat
<Kandarihu> The cameraman's outfit reminds me of Hard Gay
<Conyst> need a moment chew it over with twix
<RosePetal> He's hitting on them. I can tell.
<Everlasting_Joy> Conyst: :D
<OJ> RosePetal: Noo. He's just being friendly
<Rex_Ivan> Kandarihu: HA! I havent heard that name in years

<RosePetal> No eyepatch on anymore.
<Silverscreen> 01,11ASoftFluffyThing: I went to college for Videography.

I also had to take classes in 3D Modeling (my second least favorite) Web Authoring (My third least favorite) and Drawing (My least favorite)
<Fluttercry> 05,15At this point I'd be like "you're the actor, I'm the director, shot the hell up."

<Silverscreen> 01,11SILVERSCREEN'S REVIEW: I...don't know what to make of this movie. It seems like it's from another world. It's not engaging nore is it exciting for the most part, and yet it somehow keeps your interest. If you can sit through the boring aspects of it, you get a semi decent flick that's at least intruiging to watch, but I wouldn't call it something that's entertaining. 5/10.
<Kandarihu> Hey, has anyone else ever been to Genghis Grill?
<donutpop3651> Flutteryay.
<J_E_Smith71> donutpop3651: Its time for May The Best Pet When

<Kandarihu> So this Fudruckers place is like that?
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<RDash5000> I LOVE THIS SONG
<Tovler> I can't express my delight either. I'm emotionally stunted
<diddutz> twilight_sprinkles: honestly i don't really know, never tryed it ...
<Randomnerd> Fluttershy is great like that :)
*Kurra pretends like it's the first time this song's being played ever :D
<OJ> nose touch?
<Spitfire> AWESOME COOL GOT ET

<Kurra> Sky is good :)
<Randomnerd> Mmm bunnies.
*Spitfire scremas in yaplaps voice
<Tovler> The Smile Song was leaked before this song/episode aired
<Eddmario> Kandarihu: Don't act like you're a hater. I know from my entire time coming here that you're a regular brony here...
<RaveBrony> A bullet?
<Tovler> bad ol puddy tat
<XylemTube> pony_300: guns are cannon
<Conyst> Bunnies are evil.
<OJ> I tought I taw a puddy tat

<Conyst> Hey look SQUIRREL
<cuddly_kittehs> RaveBrony: Cuddly_kittehs/mishia
<OJ> A flying squirrel does not need a caregiver in a deciduous forest
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkles, I doubt that Hasbro would detract from their winning formula, especially since they're having problems reproducing it.
<AJIsAwesome> Azuredragon: I miss that show so much.
<Pale_Horse> I'd go with the monarch. i hear they spin webs and have a deadly sting. :D
<Randomnerd> Fluttershy will give you MOAR PETS.
<Spectrum_Rush> Yellow Striped Bat eh http://derpiboo.ru/108570
<XylemTube> If i was RD i would choose the Hawk
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RaveBrony nope can't play the server is an older version
<OJ> Is the bat from Austin, TX?
<Tovler> gotta make my mind up. Which pet shall I taaaake?
<Rex_Ivan> Hey ... I just realized that apparently ALL flying creatures can sit on clouds, not just pegasus
<XylemTube> Falcon i mean
<RaveBrony> D:
<donutpop3651> Really?
<twilight_sprinkles> Kandarihu: yeah, perhaps oceans of blood and corpses might be a tiny bit beyond their plans..
<Randomnerd> I just realized, why not just give her all of them?
<cowvarkian> Pale_Horse: dat venture brothers
<donutpop3651> When?
<Eddmario> XylemTube: Bitch, please. I'd choose the fuckign bat!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well perhaps we should play later
<Kurra> Huge smiles! <3 :D BEST FACES
<AlienWarhead> Rex_Ivan Griffins can
<donutpop3651> Kurra: Agreed.
<Tovler> Pajama Sam smiles
<pony_300> Nice Waldoing, Derpy.
<RaveBrony> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Alright. Just give me a ping or message on Steam if you need some peeps :P
<Kurra> AMMAGOSH LOVE <3
<twilight_sprinkles> ooh, pajama sam, loved that game so much
<Rex_Ivan> Alienwarhead: But I mean all the animals can too
<Eddmario> When Fluttershy sings, you can hear a bit of pinkie.
<Fluttercry> 05,15So that last flim we watched was nominated for the AFI 100 Years 100 Laughs list
<Rex_Ivan> I missed that before
<RaveBrony> Does it have to update or something?
<Randomnerd> Dashie's a crappy owner, anyway -they'll look after eachother.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> k
<XylemTube> I take that back, i would choose the Eagle.... FOR AMERICA
<Pale_Horse> Duck.exe.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dunno
<Azuredragon> :P
<OJ> Fluttercry: WAAT?
<Fluttercry> 05,15yup
<Kurra> I wanna have Dashie look straight at me and smile like that, just once. :)
<Eddmario> Also, here's the part with the physics breaking duck.
<OJ> CAMERA PUSH
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<pony_300> Eddmario: Fluttershy also voices Pinkie Pie?
<twilight_sprinkles> you call that fa...nah
<AlienWarhead> twilight_sprinkles: pajama sam I have not played that game in forever
<cowvarkian> monarch, assemble?
<Tovler> A Fish Called Wanda made me laugh in the same way that last movie did
<Eddmario> pony_300: You didn't know that?
<Conyst> Hello Sketch_Toku_Brony
<twilight_sprinkles> AlienWarhead: the second was best imo <3
<OJ> The first and last word you say will be "sir"
<donutpop3651> D'awwww.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Tovler you know someone died laughing at that movie?
<RaveBrony> Oh FS <3
<twilight_sprinkles> maybe i should replay pajama sam
<OJ> Technically? Either he's a tortoise or he's not.
<Randomnerd> Waxing his shell... with turtle wax?
<Pale_Horse> *Bliiiiiiink*
<Biglaw> OJ: Sir, your crumpets are ready, would sir like tea, sir?
<pony_300> Eddmario: not until now. I always thought it was just Ashleigh Ball who was pulling double time
<ASoftFluffyThing> Tortoise
<RDash5000> oh fluttershy :)
<donutpop3651> Persistent.
<RaveBrony> twilight_sprinkles: I have not heard of that game....in...Forever! O_O
<XylemTube> <3 tank
<Eddmario> Fluttercry: Someone died laughing at The Dark Knight? Da fuck?
<Silverscreen> 01,11The problem I have with this song is that it doesn't match Dash's character too well. It's been established in the songs in Season 1 that Dash fits a rock motif most, so a glamorous song like May Best Pet Win doesn't match her style.
<RaveBrony> Reminds me of Putt-Putt :D
<twilight_sprinkles> RaveBrony: i just realized how mch i miss it..
<donutpop3651> If someone rubbed a tortoise on my face I'd think it was sorta weird.
<Randomnerd> Fluttershy, I'll adopt the Tortoise!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> tortoise wax*
<OJ> Biglaw: 4 spoons of sugat
<Fluttercry> 05,15Eddmario no A Fish called Wanda
<XylemTube> I also love Coach RD
<OJ> Biglaw: Make it 11
<Biglaw> OJ :p
<Randomnerd> Thank you, TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
<Biglaw> Swig
<AlienWarhead> 90s kids approved
<Pale_Horse> Wak
<Silverscreen> 01,11And then a million jokes on being Dashes Pet appeared.
<Biglaw> Speeeeeeeeeeeeeed
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<pony_300> Dash is such a dick. hah
<Eddmario> Fluttercry: Wasn't that an episode of Fairy Oddparents?
<Kurra> Silverscren, to me Dashie calling to turkeys would fit her style. <3
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Kandarihu> She really does have some odd standards
<RDash5000> HE'S GOING SO FAST
<Kurra> XD
<AJIsAwesome> GOTTA GO FAST
<[Alpha-Trinity]> Twilight is best pet
<diddutz> wait, was there an animation error, where RD head was behind the duck standing behind her O.o?
<Biglaw> Sonic Falco-boom
<XylemTube> Gotta go fast!
<Fluttercry> 05,15Eddmario it was a movie first
<Darf14> I hope tank gets more screen time in the next season
<OJ> Falcons only attain that speed while diving
<pony_300> Falcon is badass
<Tovler> Dying laughing is hard to believe. Fish Called Wanda was funny but not that kinda of funny from how I see it.
<Randomnerd> He's making me cry...
<Eddmario> He went so fast that he overlapped them so much that he seemed to not move that much
<twilight_sprinkles> [Alpha-Trinity]: no. Twilight is best supreme overlord of all creatures in Equestria
<Kurra> I wanna see Tank again too
<AlienWarhead> Scootaloo should be in this episode
<RDash5000> ded
<Tovler> nice job, cameraman
<OJ> Physics
<[Alpha-Trinity]> I thought that was Lauren Faust
<donutpop3651> Hummerfive!
<RDash5000> FAIL
<Eddmario> Now this part is just animal cruelity...
<Tovler> needs more ketchup
<RDash5000> *gasp*
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 Hypnobutterfly
<Fluttercry> 05,15Tovler "In 1989, Ole Bentzen, a Danish audiologist, died laughing while watching A Fish Called Wanda. His heart was estimated to have beaten at between 250 and 500 beats per minute, before he succumbed to cardiac arrest."
<Eddmario> Butterfree used Hypnotize.
<Silverscreen> 01,11Monarch used Hypnosis! It's Super Effective!
<Randomnerd> Tank, Mother-bucker!
<pony_300> all hail hypnobutterfly!
<twilight_sprinkles> butterfly used -damnit
<Pale_Horse> Oh come on Tank. You ahve a thick shell. man up.
<Sumica> 00,10it's easy to be brave when you only live for 9months
<OJ> ALL HAIL THE BUTTERFLY
<AlienWarhead> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
<twilight_sprinkles> lol
<Silverscreen> 01,11Rainbow Dash always Dresses in Style.
<AJIsAwesome> ^ :D
<OJ> KHAAN
<Kurra> I know of a young girl who died watching one of the twilight/New moon movies in south America.
<Randomnerd> American Bald Eagle playing a Canadian sport.
<Mozdoc> Still think Rainbow Dash should've taken the falcon.
<RaveBrony> Phase4: "The server you are trying to connect to is running an older version of the game" :o
<AlienWarhead> Kurra How?
<RDash5000> OW MY EARS
<twilight_sprinkles> SHOW ME YOUR WARFACE
<Eddmario> AlienWarhead: Suicide
<RDash5000> twilight_sprinkles: BULLSHIT YOU DIDN'T CONVINCE ME
<nerf_soldier> i thought i was out of pretzels for second, but then i put my hand down and found one last pretzel. it was pretty great
<RaveBrony> :D
<Tovler> Fluttercry: too much MSG in that popcorn salt, I reckon. /armchair_autopsy
<Marky> Still odd when I hear an eagle shreak on a show, because it's really a falcon.
<twilight_sprinkles> RDash5000: ...meow! ;_;
<Fluttercry> 05,15RDash5000 What's your name scumbag!?
<AJIsAwesome> I would buy that shirt from the eagle.
<Kurra> AlienWarhead, while watching the movie I think, a plot twist/breakup or somethign between the main characters was so devastating to her, she had a heart attack of grief or something.
<Pale_Horse> Sing Largo Al Factotum already, Duck. :|
<Spectrum_Rush> dat theme
<pony_300> that's all Tank can do... that and BE THE STRONGEST THERE IS
<Randomnerd> Song drop!
<RDash5000> Fluttercry: scumbag?
<RaveBrony> ^
<donutpop3651> D'awww.
<Fluttercry> 05,15RDash5000 a quote from that movie...
<Sumica> 00,10you know
<AlienWarhead> Kurra did it make the news?
<Sumica> 00,10those must have been realy small sharks
<Kurra> It did in Peru AlienWarhead.
<Fluttercry> 05,15RDash5000 you haven't actually seen Full Metal Jacket have you...
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> im back

<OJ> Secret but fun
<AlienWarhead> DUN DUN DUNNNNN
<Pale_Horse> I wanna see a race between RD and Sonic the Hedgehog someday.
<RDash5000> sim gretina remix
<Kurra> Some people take vampire movies too seriously.
<RaveBrony> This song <3 <3
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Scary butt fun
<Eddmario> When "Ride of the Valkeries" is used in a cartoon, it gets 20% cooler.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Conyst> You must shoot the womp rats.
<Eddmario> Pony reference was unintentional
<AlienWarhead> Eddmario 120% with Rainbow Dash
<RaveBrony> I listen to this song when playing any game where you fly
<Cades> my brother plays minecraft so much...
<pony_300> It's kinda sad how the Falcon loses because he won really
<Sumica> 00,10this song always reminds me of starcraft
<SirGanjalf> "I love the smell of friendship in the morning.:
<AJIsAwesome> Ouch.
<RaveBrony> and then all the pets were brutally impailed
<donutpop3651> Basically.
<Kurra> Friendship can take on many smells. o.o
<Eddmario> Sumica: It always reminds me of the Courege the Cowardly Dog episode with the Valkeries
<RDash5000> the physics. they are broken
<pony_300> Falcon will not give up!
<AlienWarhead> and then RD was arrested for animal cruelty
<RaveBrony> ._.
<AJIsAwesome> Fly above them?
<RaveBrony> ^
<twilight_sprinkles> and there was blood, everywhere
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Tovler> good thing Toon World is active
<XylemTube> derp
<XylemTube> ABALANCH
<RDash5000> DED
<SirGanjalf> ouch
<Pale_Horse> Actually, I think there's fanfic potential on what the falcon went on to do after losing to Tank. :|
<Conyst> Then steve attacks her
<AlienWarhead> This reminds me of Metal Slug 3
<Kandarihu> diddutz, I'm having trouble finding that on my own copy. What scene was the animation error?
<pony_300> can't say fluttershy didn't get what she deserved here
<OJ> It's not a bloody avalanche. And it wasn't in Dragonshy either.
<[Alpha-Trinity]> rainbow crash
<Eddmario> 127 Hours
<twilight_sprinkles> pony_300: >fluttershy
<XylemTube> that looks really uncomforatble

<Pale_Horse> Foreverrrrrr..... :O
<Silverscreen> 01,11I think at this point they were more focused on surviving through the place than being first.
<Tovler> its like fivever
<RDash5000> Eddmario: she has to eat her wing off
<Eddmario> Guess what? IT'S A FUCKING FEATHER! You can easily lose it...
<Sumica> 00,10she heard the tortises theme music
<diddutz> Kandarihu: wait a sec
<thelonepony> Tortise
<Tovler> Celestia ignored her prayers
<pony_300> TANK IS HERE FOR YOU
<Eddmario> Fluttershy: TORTISE!
<twilight_sprinkles> you can eat the turtle so you can survive longer
<Fluttercry> 05,15I'm going to go and play Civ V. Later folks!

<Pale_Horse> Thanks a lot. now I wanna play Doom again.... Kill me some Cacodaemons...
<ASoftFluffyThing> Slow and steady wins the race
<ASoftFluffyThing> How'd she get the bandage?
<AlienWarhead> So does Tank have super strength or something
<XylemTube> Badass Falcon
<[Alpha-Trinity]> and then bandages from nowhere
<Conyst> Tank also hsa a medical license. Unlike Dr. Zed.
<Eddmario> ASoftFluffyThink: You don't wanna know...
<Conyst> has*
<OJ> Pinkie lean
<Kurra> Tank is also support :)
<twilight_sprinkles> AlienWarhead: yep. in fact, after this RD and Tank took over the world http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maiaqgDAC41qc5ffho1_500.png
<AJIsAwesome> Wouldn't the talons stick into her skin?
<RDash5000> Conyst: i love you for saying that. no homo
<diddutz> Kandarihu: 8:55 on my copy, when she introduced the speed competition
<AJIsAwesome> DAT YAY?
<SirGanjalf> yay?
<Mozdoc> Ponies are made of marshmallow, talons don't hurt them.
<twilight_sprinkles> nay.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yay?
<Kurra> Tank is 135 tons Colossal weight.
<thelonepony> nay to the yay
<Sumica> 00,10why not both?

<AlienWarhead> Mozdoc just Rarity and Sweetie belle
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: Dash said only one spot.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Poor bird is sad
<AlienWarhead> yay?
<Eddmario> Deleted scene: That falcon/hawk gave RD and Tank the finger with it's wing
<XylemTube> Sumica: she's not an animal person?
<OJ> That's an absurd rule. There are so many ambiguous scenarios
<twilight_sprinkles> Sumica: the eagle is obviously a tricky bastard who just wants to steal rainbows stuff
<[Alpha-Trinity]> No just Rarity and Sweetie Belle are part marshmallow
<AJIsAwesome> Eddmario: :D
<RaveBrony> Sumica: Becuz Tank is easier to forget in later episodes apparently....
<SirGanjalf> Falcon loses with honour;_;7

<Silverscreen> 01,11Because I figured you'd have left by now.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Slenderman :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Keaton is better, in my opinion.
<thelonepony> hi Slenderman :
<OJ> Buster Keaton.
<SirGanjalf> George Clooney! *troll*
<Buytoast> why?
<thelonepony> :)*
<AlienWarhead> hi Slenderman
<cuddly_kittehs> bat cedit card
<RaveBrony> ._.
<sonicandmario85> Slenderman:HELLO SLENDY BE MY FRIEND
<cuddly_kittehs> come on Nc. you know it
<AJIsAwesome> Slenderman: Want some Slendy bucks?
<Rex_Ivan> it was pointed out that there has NEVER been a bad Joker portrail. Joker has ALWAYS been great
<cuddly_kittehs> Slenderman: Oh hi slendymane!
<Tovler> Bat Masterson could shoot both of these guys between the eyes.
<SirGanjalf> I like how Bale
<twilight_sprinkles> so That was the original, huh..twas kinda dissappointing when it was streamed
<Silverscreen> 01,11Rex_Ivan: that's because it was an awesome actor always playing him.
<richfiles> Ha! Winking! :$
<SirGanjalf> I like how Bale's and Keaton's Bruce Wayne is different.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, I'm off to bed
<RaveBrony> :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14good night everyone!
<pony_300> lol... yea he's got a good point
<OJ> ARRR
<twilight_sprinkles> the original was threatiening?...he looked like a mutated penguin...
<Silverscreen> 01,11I have to disagree on the Batman aspect. I think Bale was the better batman.
<AJIsAwesome> YARRRRRRGH
<Tovler> talk like a pirate day
<SirGanjalf> Bale's Wayne is a rich, spoiled asshole and Keaton's is an shy eccentric
<Slenderman> cuddly_kittehs: NO! I'm Slender MAN. Slender Mane is my brother from the other realm, the pony realm. Though if I recall, EqD will finally post my brother's expirience.
<sonicandmario85> YABBA MY ICING!
<Rex_Ivan> Silverscreen: but I mean in ANY incarnation. ANimation or movie or TV. I'm impressed that they never got a goose egg over the decades.
<sonicandmario85> AHHHHHHHH
<RaveBrony> Cya SaxyPretender
<thelonepony> yarg she blows!
<RaveBrony> Take care
<richfiles> Dat emphazema
<Conyst> Is that your new stage voice.
<SirGanjalf> Hello moon. Hello MOON! Hello starrrrrrrrr...
<otakon> the voice
<SirGanjalf> :D
<Sumica> 00,10lol
<twilight_sprinkles> the original moved like a penguin, the newer sounds like he swalled a chainsaw
<SirGanjalf> oops i blew it:(
<Silverscreen> 01,11Goodnight MOON! Goodnight STAR!!!
<dawnmew> That voice always did bother me.
<otakon> Goodnight STTTTTTTTTTAR
<Sumica> 00,10knew bat man would win
<otakon> DAMN YOU KEATON!
<OJ> Ledger
<Sumica> 00,10he's way better then bantman
<Buytoast> Winner: Original because he didn't like the voice?
<Buytoast> well alright
<Phase4> RaveBrony, oops
<SirGanjalf> Ledger
<RaveBrony> ??
<twilight_sprinkles> ledger 100%
<otakon> Ledger hands down
<Rex_Ivan> Buytoast: because he seemed more natural
<SirGanjalf> Ledger was Joker, Nicholson was... himself
<Phase4> the outdated version, i forgot to update
<Silverscreen> 01,11Yeah, really, Keaton was better as Wayne, but Bale was better as Batman.
<cuddly_kittehs> Slenderman: Oh. Im sorry! its just, in our relm *relm of ponies* you appear like Slendymane. that, and i'm a teenagr earth pony. I kind of lost a fear of the slender after SlendyMane lost me- and i recived one of the frist signs of my cutiemark *but i still dont know what it is, just a possbility*
<Phase4> i'ma finally make the autoupdate work
<OJ> By "The Comic" he means "The Killing Joke"
<[Alpha-Trinity]> new joker is epic
<RaveBrony> Alrighty, ty Phase4 :3
<pony_300> this was good scene
<XylemTube> oh god this scene
<otakon> eeyup
<SirGanjalf> D"
<Silverscreen> 01,11The Killing Joke and One Bad Day were the books that Ledger's Joker was based on.
<SirGanjalf> D:
<otakon> lol
<Silverscreen> 01,11:o
<otakon> dat face
<Buytoast> i like the killing joke
<pony_300> and yea he was right, it was pretty quiet when that scene happened... hell it was quiet through most of the movie
<Aircrafter> Hasn't seen that scene before, seen that just now, its night time, going to bed soon..... T_T
<cuddly_kittehs> Slenderman: don't....don't ask how i escaped. Maybe it's because i can't lose a staring contest....?
<otakon> Aircrafter: you poor bastard
<Rex_Ivan> the scene that got me was the one where he told the guy he was going to chop him into little pieces and feed him to his dogs
<SirGanjalf> "This Critic needs an enema!"
<Sumica> 00,10cant pick
<SirGanjalf> :P
<Buytoast> this critic needs to stop
<richfiles> Joker works well with dat Kakihara smile! :O
<Buytoast> wait, he's done right?
<Sumica> 00,10both alfrids were better for there respictive universes
<ASoftFluffyThing> OOhh Nostalgia Critic
<Silverscreen> 01,11My favorite scene is the one where he gives a lecture to the Mob about how Batman changed everything.
<d3rb> Buytoast, yep
<Buytoast> ah, then it's a good time
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<SirGanjalf> AAAH:O
<SirGanjalf> Yeah, too much Vicky Vale in Burton's Batman
<otakon> yes he does
<OJ> He's a butler. This is what you pay him for
<otakon> bc he is a BRIT
<twilight_sprinkles> lol
<SirGanjalf> :D
<AJIsAwesome> But I like Alfred's speeches. :S
<Kimori> wierd
<otakon> and Brit's ALWAYS HAVE SPEECHES
<Buytoast> this gag makes no sense
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :D
<Tovler> that life experience
<Rex_Ivan> I did think that Cane did the whole, "I've lived more than you ever will" bit pretty well
<Silverscreen> 01,11Buytoast, what exactly is your problem with him? He's not that bad of a critic, and he does make a strong statement on how people can have differing opinions.
<Eddmario> Alfred is supposed to be the wise man. Nolan generation was better.
<otakon> Wait
<Sumica> 00,10olman is way better gorden
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<otakon> Oldman was Gordan?
<otakon> WHAT?!
<Sumica> 00,10every one loved bob
<pony_300> right right he Gordon holy shit Oldman was Gordon how did that work
<otakon> HOLY SHIT
<SirGanjalf> BOB!
<Kimori> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqV_qqA56QE
<otakon> what?
<Silverscreen> 01,11Bob!
<Buytoast> to me alot of his stuff is over his own personal shit rather than looking at it overall
<Rex_Ivan> everyone remembers Bob
<otakon> REALLY?
<OJ> Microsoft Bob
<Rosfox> BECAUSE IT IS BOB
<otakon> WHAT?!
<Rex_Ivan> well ... I remember Bob
<Buytoast> like orignal batman winning because of how someone sounds
<AJIsAwesome> BAD TOUCH
<Sumica> 00,10wins by a bob
<otakon> I remember that Bob dided
<Buytoast> also his gags are moer annoying than entertaining
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: :(
<otakon> by a Bob
<otakon> well this is a no brainer
<SirGanjalf> otakon: Joker killed him IIRC
<[Alpha-Trinity]> I negate this and say the cartoon wins
<otakon> SirGanjalf: eeyup
<Phase4> RaveBrony, was easier than expected, servers are updating
<otakon> lol
<Phase4> will autostart when done
<Buytoast> like that temple of doom thing where he forced the freeze frame for about 10 different parts in order to force the joke through
<Silverscreen> 01,11You do realize that after his start, all of his reviews were ones that people requested, right? And as time went on, he reviews the entire movie and gives a more fair review at the end of each video. Not to mention that it's just a character. He's not really reflecting Doug Walker's personal beliefs (for the most part)
<otakon> Goddamn Shaky Cam
<Azuredragon> Shh
<Silverscreen> 01,11shh
<otakon> Silverscreen: more like a hyperbole of his opinions
<AJIsAwesome> Shhhhhh
<otakon> Shhh?
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Shhh
<Eddmario> That part with the Semi flipping in Dark Knight is one of my favorite scenes of all time.
<thelonepony> Shhhh
<Conyst> quiet Patsy
<otakon> Eddmario: eeyup
<Buytoast> i hate the character
<Buytoast> i don't care about the guy
<Buytoast> same like pewdiepie
<otakon> Most of the Old Vs. New almost ALWAYS have a tie
<Silverscreen> 01,11He completely bashed Sonic the Hedgehog and gave a fair beatdown to Hook despite admitting it was a movie he liked.
<richfiles> Spamming... Quiet??? :|
<Rex_Ivan> Buytoast has not yet understood that the entire internet is just a giant stage play
<Buytoast> i understand that
<Buytoast> he's just a terrible actor
<otakon> Silverscreen: except he praised SatAM
<Rex_Ivan> oh good
<AlienWarhead> Buytoast fine do like any of the other critics
<OJ> Spam spam spam eggs bacon spam baked beans spam spam
<pony_300> Silverscreen: it felt good seeing him give props to saturday Sonic
<Rex_Ivan> well you WILL have crappy actors from time to time
<otakon> lovely spam
<otakon> delcious
<Kencolt> Silverscreen: Actually, he bashed Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog and respected Sonic SatAM.
<durger> oh i forgot that Prince music montage in Batman
<Silverscreen> 01,11THEY ANALYZE EVERYTHING!
<pony_5252> I think the semi flip isn't possible, at least not using lamp posts.
<Buytoast> not really no
<Buytoast> i don't pay much attention to critics
<twilight_sprinkles> ^
<Silverscreen> 01,11Yeah, I was talking about Adventures.
<Buytoast> unless it affects me
<RaveBrony> Alright, ty Phase4 :)
<otakon> pony_5252: it's not
<OJ> It Stinks!
<RaveBrony> Any estimated time?
<durger> akhem
<Sumica> 00,10lamp post and the anchors set in to the street pony_5252
<OJ> Hotchie Motchie
<Phase4> should be ready by now
<pony_5252> What anchors?
<Phase4> if not wait ~3 minutes, if its still not done i'll check
<RaveBrony> Oh, cool, ill check
<Rex_Ivan> the whole point of the Dark Knight was the concepts it was givin the audience
<otakon> GODDAMMIT
<SirGanjalf> Burton's Batman wins because of BOB.
<otakon> FUCK BOB
<SirGanjalf> nuff said
<twilight_sprinkles> brb, gotta go send him some hate mail
<otakon> fucking Bob
<Sumica> 00,10after he zigzaged the lamppost he fired the other end of the cabled in to the pathment
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkles: :D
<OJ> They did it like that because $$$$$
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<Kencolt> And anyone with half-working eyes and more than a half dozen brain cells would bash Adventures.
<SirGanjalf> :D
<Buytoast> now is it just me or is his face very very punchable
<Conyst> Batman wins no matter what.
<Eddmario> That doesn't even SOUND like Christian Bale...
<Rex_Ivan> hehe
<RaveBrony> Lmao!!
<Tovler> Family Guy did it
<otakon> Kencolt: Adventures? OH THAT piece of shit
<Buytoast> like you just want to slap his shit until there aint nothing left
<pony_5252> It IS Christian Bale
<twilight_sprinkles> thats me on the phone btw
<pony_5252> From a rage he did
<otakon> Eddmario: that's an actual sound clip from him
<d3rb> nah its fake
<Silverscreen> 01,11I watch him more for the humor (which is a required taste), but I do find that his final review at the end of a video (which is a more fair judgement of the movie) makes sense and is given in a respectable manner.
<OJ> I think I should buyToast Spam eggs Spam
<otakon> d3rb: um no it's not
<VenHur> Yeah, Batman is far improved.
<RaveBrony> :D
<d3rb> trust me, im a doctor
<SirGanjalf> ffs
<Buytoast> oh no
<Buytoast> please
<Buytoast> please no
<Azuredragon> HELLFIRE
<otakon> Silverscreen: same here
<Everlasting_Joy> Yes! I saw this yesterday and loved it.
<CK|Ded> o.o
<Eddmario> otakon: I know that. I just think it sounds like it's someoen else
<diddutz> d3rb: a doctor or the doctor?
<Rex_Ivan> HA! reign of fire! Has that been choosen as the B-movie yet?
<VenHur> But the Dark Knight really has some crazingly good lines.
<SirGanjalf> Pie Jesu domine...
<twilight_sprinkles> meh, for me the newer batman was better in almost every way
<Kandarihu> Man, that angry Christian Bale soundboard
<SirGanjalf> Dona eis requiem...
<Eddmario> Okay, WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE WATCHING?!?!?!?
<d3rb> the doctor of doctors diddutz
<Aircrafter> Wow, spam all of a sudden.
<Rosfox> Hellfire?
<twilight_sprinkles> the original was kinda boring for me, tbh..
<pony_5252> Watch the Nostalgia Critic for humor, watch his reviews as Doug for critical analyzing.
<SirGanjalf> *smack*
<Conyst> Hellfire!
<pony_300> I have to disagree though, the plot of DKR keeps taking twist every other minute. Burton Batman, outside of the cosmetic plot, I didn't feel as engaged personally.
<otakon> Eddmario: it really is audio ripped from a recording of him freaking out over him.
<Buytoast> why must they always force things with ponies
<AlienWarhead> lol I just watched this
<Pale_Horse> I just noticed. Those two unicorns must have the same special talent. :P
<Buytoast> what a shame
<diddutz> someone ward the daleks, he's here
<pony_300> wait I mean TDK
<twilight_sprinkles> GOOD MORNING QUAZIMODO
<Tovler> hm, I gave Batman 8/10 so I guess I agree with the Critic
<OJ> Hunchback
<RaveBrony> What is this?
<otakon> HELLFIRE!
<otakon> HELL YEAH!
<pony_5252> Oh this is gonna be good . . .
<RaveBrony> Oh, nvm :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> Twilight is Frollo?
<Pale_Horse> Rest in peace, Tony Jay.
<Number> ...
<ASoftFluffyThing> Then who is Quasimodo?
<otakon> ASoftFluffyThing: OCD so yeah
<[Alpha-Trinity]> I'm out it's getting really weird and I'm tired
<Number_11> ...
<Azuredragon> dat dancing
<VenHur> ...Fluttershy?
<otakon> VenHur: no Spike
<Rex_Ivan> Twilight LUSTS for the rainbow vag!
<Everlasting_Joy> I love this song so much. There' so much passion behind it.
<pony_5252> Hellfire is easily among the top tier of Disney songs.
<Number_11> Is this from the first or second one?
<otakon> oh God
<otakon> THE SHIPPING
<Kandarihu> Sheesh, this again?
<pony_300> wait..... this creepy scene
<AlienWarhead> I kind of hope this was with Spike and Rarity
<otakon> Number_11: are you SHITTING me?
<pony_300> to ponies.... oh god
<pony_5252> Twilight is Frollo, pfffft.
<otakon> Number_11: there is NO comparison it's from the first
<AlienWarhead> Number_11 first movie
<otakon> dammit now I have the urge to watch it again
<twilight_sprinkles> Rex_Ivan http://www.myfacewhen.net/view/1648-noface
<Tovler> gasp. Hell in a disney movie?! (I hadn't seen Sleeping Beauty yet)
<Eddmario> otakon: Hey, I haven't seen the second one, and the first one I haven't seen in a whole DECADE
<SirGanjalf> Hell, even with ponies this song still gives me shivers.
<RaveBrony> God, this song is just so great.
<Buytoast> the second hunchback was just a money grubber
<otakon> exactly
<otakon> I HATE money grubber sequels
<pony_5252> Even Milton would have slapped Frollo upside the head.
<AJIsAwesome> Would the second hunchback movie be considered a B movie? :D
<otakon> Like Christmas Story 2 is gonna be
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: it's a Z movie
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Eddmario> The ONLY thing I remember from this movie is "Pour the wine and cut the cheese"
<Buytoast> if you can consider it a movie
<[Alpha-Trinity]> It's so good...
<Conyst> There was no second hunchback movie.
<OJ> Buytoast: A sequel to a movie intended to capitalize on the first movie's popularity?
<Rex_Ivan> Twilight_sprinkles: oh come now. we can all agree to rainbow vag
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I know. It's terribly bad. :D
<Tovler> Clerk 2 was ok, I guess
<Kandarihu> otakon, there's a Christmas Story 2 in development?
<otakon> Eddmario: that is sad considering it's fine music
<otakon> Kandarihu: IS? it's DONE
<AlienWarhead> otakon Hold the phone, CHRISMAS STORY 2?!?
<otakon> AlienWarhead: yeah
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> and then he gets controlled by the dream eaters lol
<twilight_sprinkles> god have mercy on me..
<otakon> It's a DIRECT sequel
<otakon> takes place the next christmas
<Silverscreen> 01,11I think Batman is better as a superhero movie, but TDK is a better film overall because it gives challenging concepts and ideals. The only issue is that TDK explains everything through speeches and constant talking rather than through symbolism and actions, which is the point of a visual media. But, you can't have complete perfection, so we take what we get, and TDK gives us a hell
<Silverscreen> 1,11of a lot.
<Eddmario> You gotta admit, both The Lion King sequals were pretty good for direct-to-video films
<Rex_Ivan> BUUURRN
<AlienWarhead> otakon god have mercy on the film makers
<otakon> and it's DVD only
<otakon> AlienWarhead: agreed
<otakon> WELP
<Kencolt> This guy...
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Buytoast> oh god, this asshat again
<Buytoast> oi
<pony_5252> Ducktales cover, hmmmmmm.
<otakon> that was pretty goddamn AWESOME!
<dawnmew> DAMN IT. This song is like the Game.
<otakon> Buytoast: ASSHAT?
<Eddmario> Just so you know, the MLP theme in this song is the G1 theme
<Pale_Horse> Duck Tits! Woo Hoo! :D
<AJIsAwesome> DUCKTALES!
<RaveBrony> Oh my god.
<Silverscreen> 01,11IT WILL NEVER LEAVE, IT WILL NEVER LEAVE!!
<otakon> Buytoast: can YOU play those songs and sing it as well?
<SirGanjalf> Ducktales? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<otakon> Silverscreen: lol
<twilight_sprinkles> the original was just boring to me, i was half-asleep. also, batman killed people which greatly took away from his character
<DJ_POn-3|PeachStreak> howdy everypony how are y'all just logged on

<otakon> Also

<cuddly_kittehs> Lunar_Brony: Checkmate (danny phantom fanfiction)
*Slenderman stares at cuddlykittehs
<Rex_Ivan> Sumica: exit this world, enter the next.
<Lunar_Brony> cuddly_kittehs that name hits me in the nostalgia
<Shizuka> 13nopony but me got sumica's joke
<RDash5000> twilight_sprinkles: i usually don't listen to the "mainstream" dubstep artists, because they're usually shit
<Shizuka> 13i am disappoint .-.
<NocturnalBlade> so many haros
<cuddly_kittehs> Lunar_Brony: this ones a grueling 86 chapters and these are DEFINTLY a good 5-6 pages each chapter
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Foppish Physician + Quadwrangler <3
<cuddly_kittehs> somtimes its just 1-2 pages thu
<RDash5000> dat eyepatch
<Dr_Fumbles> "Dubstep" and "Artists" should not be in the same sentence.
<Rex_Ivan> shizuka: and it always falls short when you have to explain the joke
<Spectrum_Rush> dat twi plush http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/251158761295?item=251158761295&ViewItem=
<Dr_Fumbles> Light?

<Rex_Ivan> shizuka: I'm sorry. I feel I;ve failed you
<twilight_sprinkles> dubstep>rap
<Slenderman> Spectrum_Rush: PLEASE GIMME! TAKE ALL MY BITS
<RDash5000> twilight_sprinkles: exactly
<Dr_Fumbles> Rap isn't even music.
<RDash5000> Dr_Fumbles: it isn't
<GreeTheGermanBrony> The dubbing sounds very good. Who dubbed it?
<Lunar_Brony> cuddly_kittehs heh, nice. I'm /trying/ to read "Fallout: Equestria". Do you know how big that damn story is?
<cowvarkian> sergey smirnoff
<otakon> Smirnoff?

<otakon> yeah I noticed jackass
<twilight_sprinkles> Rex_Ivan: smirnov*. and it is
<cuddly_kittehs> Lunar_Brony: I like the story, but its to long. FOR ME
<GreeTheGermanBrony> I thank sunshine for dubbing this awesome show
<Slenderman> Spectrum_Rush: No... that's a book called Kindle, that's not right. Go kill that book with fire and replace it with a "How to Dance" book.
<twilight_sprinkles> Rex_Ivan: its a somewhat common last name
<cuddly_kittehs> Lunar_Brony: maybe its because its harder to read on comp? i could read fallout equestria WAY EASIER if it was in paper form.
<Spectrum_Rush> oh Sumica http://derpiboo.ru/109070

<cowvarkian> otakon: with dark magic
<Lunar_Brony> cuddly_kittehs yeah, reading on a moniter isn't the best on your eyes. I'm getting an e-reader which lets me download directly from Google Docs, so I can read the fic there. I can also surf the web, so any other fics are at my fingertips

<Lunar_Brony> seems about right
<twilight_sprinkles> :kickount Nobody
<twilight_sprinkles> :kickcount Nobody
<BerryPunch> twilight_sprinkles: Nobody has been kicked 0 times
<Rex_Ivan> Twilight_sprinkles: I mean that American popculture dictates that the name smirnov is reserved solely for an alchololic beverage. and that we shouldn't think about the origins of that name
<twilight_sprinkles> bleh.
<Kinixys|AFKish> What's a 'throne'?
<cuddly_kittehs> Lunar_Brony: E-reader can be a bitch somtimes, but at least it has black text, and the screen isnt to bright. but still: PHYSICAL BOOKS ARE WONDERFUK ;)

<Rex_Ivan> twilight_sprinkles: I mean Booze. it is pretty famous. If you say Smirnov, then many people will think Vodka

<Sumica> 00,10yeah but radioactive film has a treatment on it to prevent sunlight from changing it
<twilight_sprinkles> they ran out of budget, so they jsut did claps
<Sumica> 00,10500 rads
<Ryunosuke> a nuclear ractor
<Dester> its made of radiation
<Ryunosuke> *reactor
<Sumica> 00,10a secret reactor
<Kencolt> Or a forgotten one.
<twilight_sprinkles> Dester: made of radiation? im afraid thats not possible :P
<scout19_tf2> it must have been the tusamis dat destroyed da city den in the future
<Sumica> 00,10she forgot to hit spacebar
<Shizuka> 13she jumps as well as black mesa gordon
<Dester> it was a joke, i know well that it is not possible
<twilight_sprinkles> Dester: ok sowwe :P
<Dester> so-kay
<SirGanjalf> damn those bottomless pits, i've had enough of them after Black Mesa.
<Rex_Ivan> Shizuka: its all a joke. it;s all a dream
<twilight_sprinkles> youre all a dream. in fact im going wake up soon and its still friday morning
<Sumica> 00,10woooooooops
<thelonepony> Tachkoma to the rescue
<scout19_tf2> just in time
<Dester> twilght_sprinkles and the move living in oblivion does notn exist right?
<SirGanjalf> Shizuka: Oh right, and crotch-jumping: i'm sick of it too
<Sumica> 00,10secret reactor
<Sumica> 00,10hidden inside a skyrise
<twilight_sprinkles> Dester: yep
<Shizuka> 13cause
<Shizuka> 13every building has a smokestack like that
<Shizuka> 13people must be too scared of the 0.1 rad to take a look :3
<Sumica> 00,10clearly it's just the AC condencers
<twilight_sprinkles> why so serious?..
<dawnmew> So, um, question for those that understand the lore here... it apparently works, but who thought it was a good idea to give tanks the intelligence of basically children?
<Dester> they are FAR smarter than children, those are just personality types
<Dester> to ACT naive
<pony_677873> Cupcakes
<Sumica> 00,10the kid that helped them find the reactor is dead
<Dester> they are far from it
<Sumica> 00,10that was what the paper said
<thelonepony> they just gave them voices of children to make them adorable :3
<Shizuka> 13and so is she
<Sumica> 00,10and so is the woman tougasa saved
<dawnmew> So they aren't actually prone to, say, making a mistake that would cause them to attack based on naivety? This is just presentation factor to make tanks on the street less threatening?
<Shizuka> 13togusa is a walking death trap
<Dester> yes
<SirGanjalf> thelonepony: Same thing with Portal turrets
<Dester> on the nose
<dawnmew> Gotcha. That's actually pretty smart.
<Shizuka> 13the guy from the sunflower society, now these two
<Sumica> 00,10the men in black
<thelonepony> ture SirGanjalf :3
<Dester> yeah, no frankenstien complex
<Lunar_Shock> Yo
<thelonepony> true*
<Kencolt> TOgusa'a like The Doctor. he's not looking for trouble, but trouble finds him.
<Shizuka> 13i love they have a credit for the individual eleven logo
<Shizuka> 13cause an infinity is so hard to draw

<brodashX> :O
<dawnmew> So much backing-up-related death.
<Maid_RainBow> Sumica dont tease NewSuperBronyU
<OneTrickPony> I hate the fact that I live right on the street where the fire trucks always drive through
<MadSurge> WOOT R-TYPE
<Sumica> 00,10Gradius3 was better
<MadSurge> This game :|
<dawnmew> I hate it in these games when the walls will instantly blow up your spaceship no matter how slowly you graze them, but the enemies are just like "lol wut wall" and pass through them uninjured.
<Sumica> 00,10it's a gundam
<OneTrickPony> this is intense
<MadSurge> dawnmew: all old school shooters then :D
<brodashX> Invisable walls
<dawnmew> Basically, yes. :P
<dawnmew> Invisible walls are even worse, although not usually in this genre.
<OneTrickPony> O_O
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:<
<brodashX> a maze made out of invisable walls
<brodashX> never finish
<dawnmew> They did that once in Pokemon Gold/Silver.

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:<
<dawnmew> One of the gym leaders has an invisible floor, and if you stepped outside of it, you fell into a pit. And then somehow fell at the beginning of the maze.

<Maid_RainBow> well i have to go everypony

<Lil_B> SupBronyU
<AdamTheDuck> D!*
<dawnmew> That was wonderful.
<AdamTheDuck> Moo best name ever
<Lil_B> damnit :/
<Lil_B> Luigi is the best Character of the Game
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door :D
<Buytoast> ah, this music is so nice to hear again
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The best Paper Mario game in the series.
<Lil_B> I really want a Paper Mario Title for the WiiU, because I would like to see it in HD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02IKR :D
<Lil_B> maybe I should Buy Super Paper Mario, always looked interresting to mee
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02It's a good game :)
<Buytoast> super paper mario aint too bad
<Buytoast> it's pretty nice
<Buytoast> which reminds me
<Buytoast> i still have to strong arm my brother into rebuying it and twilight princess for me
<Lil_B> I just find it funny that I've played only one, but Still have the Soundtrack in lossless files of all 3 XD
<Lil_B> I really didn't enjoyed Twilight Princess :(
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:(
<PeachStreak> ello everypony
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hai PeachStreak :)
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Midna's fault, right?
<dawnmew> "Hello, plumber I've never heard of and is by no means a legendary hero that has defeated foes magnitudes stronger than me before breakfast!"
<JRPHONE> NewSuperBronyU: my tummy hurts
<Lil_B> hey PeachStreak
<Buytoast> i wouldn't be so hellbent on forcing him to buy it back for me if it weren't the first game i got for the Wii back when it was new and shit
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02JRPHONE: I'm sorry :(
<Lil_B> MadSurge I didn't Mind Midna
<Buytoast> better tha FI
<PeachStreak> to anypony who new DJ_POn-3 this is my new name
<MadSurge> Buytoast: I'm sorry, but actively malicious and trolling is worse than droning and merely annoying
<Buytoast> what in the hell are you talking about?
<Buytoast> he stole them when i was off at the university to buy black ops for the PS3
<dawnmew> Even a scholar didn't recognize Mario by appearances. Why is he NOT iconic in his own world as he is in the REAL world?
<Buytoast> it ain't trolling or malicious if the bastard owes me
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Also weird how besides him, Luigi, Mario, Wario, and Waluigi, Daisy, and Peach there are no other humans in the Mushroom Kingdom.
<p4ngya> one word
<p4ngya> japan
<MadSurge> ^
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I think Japan has humans there though...a lot of them...
<Hat> OH YES PAPER MARIO
<p4ngya> but i hear they're not very social in general
<Lil_B> MadSurge too many useless Items, a rather wanna be-Dark Stily that didn't really work and way too many unnecessarily unconvinient things (Like every Rupee you take once you restart the game pauses the game for almost 10 seconds) >.<
<p4ngya> at least not in public that is
<Lil_B> as far as I know, Mario and Luigi used too live as Plumbers in Brooklyn, when they got sucked into this world though a Pipe
<p4ngya> damn that sounded racist didn't it
<Hat> This is my favourite single player game of all time
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02And Princess Peach became the princess...how?
<MadSurge> Money
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:P
<Hat> Magic
<doughnutjoe> snort snort
<doughnutjoe> HEY THERE YOU SEXY BRONIES
<Lil_B> p4ngya our Teacher said once that Japanese people often thing very high of themself in comparison to other countrys, but I never met any japanese people so I can't confirm that :)
<p4ngya> no mario!
<Hat> Hangmario
<Lil_B> dat gibbet
<p4ngya> suicide isn't the answer!
<Hat> There are save points, what if that was the quit option
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I wonder...
<Lil_B> people don't die in this world :P they just hang on the gibbet to prevent them form doing something stupid again :P
<doughnutjoe> if i brang scissors to that world.... i will be unstoppable
<Lil_B> doughnutjoe or fire
<Hat> Is this on the Wii
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Gamecube
<p4ngya> i remember my teacher told me that on an international survey, American students are the most confident in their math skills, yet they do the poorest on their math scores out of all first-world countries XD
<doughnutjoe> yeah or that
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But I am playing this on a Wii though
<Lil_B> Hat gamecube, but it's played in the Wii
<Hat> :O I can get this on Wii :O
<Hat> Or is it just the disc
<doughnutjoe> Hat you can also emulate it for free!!!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You can play the original GCN disc on the Wii if your Wii was made before 2010.
<Lil_B> it doesn't work in later Wii Models?
<Hat> I lost the disc in a house move, along with every game except for Melee
<Buytoast> wait, you can't play gamecube games on newer wii models?
<Buytoast> if you can't that's horseshit
<doughnutjoe> as long as i can play Wind Waker on wii... im okay
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Buytoast: Nope, they discontinued GCN support on them recently in 2010. You can't play GCN games on them nor use GCN Controllers.
<Buytoast> horseshit
<Hat> What about on the Wii U
<Buytoast> that's just shameful
<Buytoast> i know the wii u can't
<doughnutjoe> Then how can you play SSBB on wii then?
<Buytoast> but still
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Wii U supports Wii games.
<Hat> That's terrible
<Buytoast> brawl is a wii title
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02doughnutjoe: Using the Wii Remote and Nunchuck or Classic Controller
<Hat> What do I need to play Wii on my computer monitor
<doughnutjoe> i know but wiimotes suck for brawl
<Buytoast> man, i'm glad i have a 2006 model
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02ikr
<doughnutjoe> :( and i was thinking about buying a wii...
<Buytoast> that must suck
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You can buy a refurbished one, or find one that contains a Wii Remote w/ Wii Motion Plus.
<Buytoast> i am genuinely upset now
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02NOT the one that contains a Wii Remote Plus though
<Buytoast> well, at least they still sell gamecubes for about 20 bucks
<Buytoast> at least at the store i'm near
<doughnutjoe> Gamestop sells gamecubes for 30$
<Hat> I liked the Gamecube
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Same here :)
<doughnutjoe> it comes with a controller
<p4ngya> this music :D
<Buytoast> Gamecube was nice
<doughnutjoe> ^ yup
<doughnutjoe> especially that one metroid game
<doughnutjoe> the fps one
<Buytoast> goddammit frankley
<Buytoast> Metroid Prime?
<Jmo> Metroid Prime woop woop.
<doughnutjoe> yeah
<Hat> I liked 1080 avalanche, you could connect several Gamecubes and race about 14 players at once
<Buytoast> Prime was my first metroid game
*doughnutjoe has never played nor heard of 1080 avalanche
<Buytoast> got it for about 5 bucks and didn't touch it for months because i thought it was some shitty halo/resident evil knockoff
<doughnutjoe> sorry :$
<Hat> Double DAsh
<doughnutjoe> ^^^^^^YES
<doughnutjoe> i still have a double dash cd
<Buytoast> double dash was fun stuff too
<doughnutjoe> yup yup
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Before any wiff of this game appeared publically, I imagined what a new Paper Mario game would be...
<Buytoast> i should probably pick that up one of these days too
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02In fact, I tried making it with a game maker I found online ><
<MadSurge> Buytoast: Metroid is million times better than Halo! D:
<Lil_B> I bought Metroid Prime Triology about 2 years agon, but I can't force myserlf though Prime 2 Echoes -.-
<Buytoast> well i'd never heard of it
<Buytoast> so i just based it off the price and the picture
<doughnutjoe> i like HALO a little more than metroid
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The story I envisioned was collecting seven Crystal Jewels to open a large door that led to a treasure...
<MadSurge> Lil_B: it's the hardest one...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Then this game was announced with the same story O-O
<p4ngya> NewSuperBronyU: pshhh what
<p4ngya> i need proof!
<doughnutjoe> NewSuperBronyU Nintendo hax you
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I predicted the story of this game a year or two before this game came out ><
<Buytoast> echoes can be fairly annoying because of the damned dark and light word dhinanigans
<Buytoast> shinanigans
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I have the game file somewhere...
<MadSurge> Ok guys, need to reboot. Brb
<doughnutjoe> nintendo hacked NewSuperBronyU and stole his idea. GO SUE THEM!
<Lil_B> MadSurge yeah, and the switching between the 2 Sides of the Planet is a Pain. And I have no Idea where to go :/
<Hat> If I get a HDMI cable to go between Wii and my video card, will it show up on the PC
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02In fact, your first partner in my game was getting Goombario again :)
<LightTrooper105> hallo everypony
<Buytoast> just stand around for about 10-20 minutes then son
<Buytoast> if you have the hint thing working it'll tell you where to go
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hat: Wii doesn't support HDMI out.
<Hat> Oh no
<Lil_B> Hat there do exist Adapter though, but it will not end up as 1080p HDMI
<doughnutjoe> lawlmy auntie called me
<Hat> Thanks Lil_B
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<doughnutjoe> and i played rarity over the phone :D

<MadSurge> YAAAAAY Phase4 WON
<MadSurge> .__. CHRYSALIS, it's not hard to say!
<OneTrickPony> yay I joined
<MadSurge> :D
<MadSurge> DU NUUUUUUUUUUU
<OneTrickPony> imma go to sleep now see ya guys later
<AdamTheDuck> Night OneTrickPony
<Chrysalis> was i pinged?
<Tiberium126> I havent slept for 36hours so I think its best if I go to bed. Night all
<TheMonstaMuffin> lol
<TheMonstaMuffin> night Tiberium126
<Chrysalis> so quiet
<Jmo> Yep
<ACS13123> Oh
<ACS13123> Hai thar
<d3rb> hey ACS13123
<ACS13123> So wait
<ACS13123> Is this saxton hale
<ACS13123> But with ponies
<d3rb> if by saxton hale you mean tf2 then yes. i have no idea what saxton hale is
<Phase4> chat y u silent
<LightTrooper105> im back
<Chrysalis> because im in shock
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Phase4> Chrysalis, why?
<Chrysalis> at one of the popular fics on fimfiction
<LightTrooper105> i just got back from Borderland 2
<LightTrooper105> which is?
<Buytoast> i'm trying to figure out this c++ linked list shit
<Buytoast> it hurts
<Phase4> Buytoast, linked lists are easy :P
<Chrysalis> Buytoast thats the easiest bit
<Phase4> pointer to next element
<Buytoast> i missed the class
<Buytoast> so i don't know what we're supposed to be doing with it
<Buytoast> and these nodes
<Chrysalis> a linked list is an array that can change size
<Chrysalis> it works by every element (node) having a reference to the next one in the list
<Chrysalis> so when you want an item
<Chrysalis> you start from the beginning and count through following the references
<Buytoast> well i mena he gives us a template, i'm just not all that sure on what i'm supposed to fill it with or how
<Chrysalis> what do you mean
<Buytoast> like he gives us teh entire program, but he gutted out the entire list part
<Buytoast> so we have to figure out what to fit in there
<Chrysalis> seems easy enough
<Phase4> "how to outsmart a bullet"
<Phase4> "by saxton hale"
<Chrysalis> Phase4 have a thick skull
<ACS13123> Phase4: that pinkie eyy?
<ACS13123> Thats a weird rage...
<ACS13123> p=p
<ACS13123> O no...
<Phase4> Buytoast, that is an easy task
<Phase4> y u complaining
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Chrysalis> Buytoast what level of education are you at?
<Buytoast> sophomore in the university
<Chrysalis> ah 2nd year
<LightTrooper105> lol at Phase..
<Chrysalis> your only just doing linked lists?
<LightTrooper105> well back to cooking
<Buytoast> yeah, linked lists, trees, heaps and other things
<Buytoast> were those pikmin?
<alexxm> hey guys
<Chrysalis> heap is just a large non-continous piece of memory
<Chrysalis> easiest way to describe a tree is a list with multiple next references
<Buytoast> i think alot of the problem is i forgot alot of this shit over summer because i was a complete dumbass
<Chrysalis> you didnt teach yourself over the summer?
<Buytoast> i kept putting it off
<ACS13123> So this is basically:
<ACS13123> Saxton hale
<ACS13123> With ponies
<ACS13123> And custom taunts
<Buytoast> in other words, i was a complete dumbass
<ACS13123> And pinkie screens
<ACS13123> Thats fun
<Chrysalis> yeah,
<ACS13123> THese downloads take forever
<ACS13123> >_>
<alexxm> so what did you guys vote for in the lottery
<Chrysalis> i can't remember
<Chrysalis> i know i did actually vote for the first time in 2 months
<Phase4> i'm not doing so well
<Phase4> ACS13123, ikr
<alexxm> i voted for kung fu hustle and castle of caglistro
<ACS13123> Phase4: I've been sitting here for 10 minutes and its only half way through
<Phase4> it is big download
<ACS13123> big?
<ACS13123> You mean Humongiantic
<ACS13123> humongigantic*
<ACS13123> Its big...
<Alchemist> alexxm: I voted for Man on Fire and the animatrix. These two are the ones I always vote for till they get picked :)
<alexxm> sound like good choices Alchemist
<Alchemist> alexxm: the animatrix has tara strong in it for about 30 seconds, of course its good :D
<MadSurge> Alchemist: I only am consistent on my B movie, I actually have no idea how to determine if a movie is A worthy because I'm dumb :D
<alexxm> MadSurge whats your b movie
<Alchemist> MadSurge: I dont exactly know how to decide either. i either go with how known/popular it is and how it was rated on imdb.
<alexxm> MadSurge i mean A
<ACS13123> Chat is rather slow...
<MadSurge> I got a few cartoons I'd LOVE to see here, but they're in Italian :D
<MadSurge> alexxm: you know Braindead?
<alexxm> i usaully go by it's reviews and wether they're conserded cult movies
<Alchemist> MadSurge: dont they have english subtitles?
<alexxm> MadSurge the one with the zombie baby
<MadSurge> Alchemist: maybe one. You think the mods would accept a version subtitled by me? :O
<Alchemist> MadSurge: if its coherent I dont see why not.
<MadSurge> alexxm: yep, the one with the zombie baby :D
<Alchemist> I was also thinking about submitting a hungarian cult movie, but I dont think people outside of hungary would appreciate it.
<MadSurge> Alchemist: you hungarian?
<Alchemist> MadSurge: yep.
<MadSurge> Alchemist: europe is cool! :D
<Alchemist> MadSurge: well, maybe not whole europe but I agree :D
<MadSurge> SCOOTALOOOO

<Sonny> lol your name suits what I drew recently ;p
<Evil_Spike> Meep, aka tablets for noobs
<Mozdoc> Party with the ponies marathon? Does this mean they're replaying season two or something in preparation for season three?
<ekips> beep beep I'm a meep
<Phase4> dat android keyboard
<Phase4> meep e meep
<Evil_Spike> Thanks sonny
<Spectrum_Rush> oh I know a friend whos is not gonna be happy about the meep
<Jake> we had a mareathon in germany a few months ago
<Evil_Spike> Wht kid wants mouthwash?
<Sumica> 00,10wonder if we will see an anouncment today
<ekips> Jake We did?
<Phase4> lol club pnguin
<Evil_Spike> Dat dubstep
<Jake> yea at nich/cc
<Eli> Phase4: you should have seen that :) after you left, i got to be the health box. i just placed me where there's normally one, and no one saw me
<Jake> a FULL day from 8 am to 8 pm
<Barbetos> disney!? on hub? waaattt
<Kandarihu> Sumica, have you heard my theory on this last night?
<Evil_Spike> Logic? What be that?
<Phase4> Eli, i was trying the same with ammo crate but failed misserably
<Sumica> 00,10dont think so
<Phase4> Kandarihu, theory?
<Evil_Spike> Ponies?
<ekips> Phase4 you were a different ammo box than there was on the map
<ekips> that blew it
<Jake> seems i have something new to distract me from drawing
<Phase4> ekips, ikr
<Barbetos> mare-a-thon. cute.
<Kandarihu> My theory is that The HUB is going to use the ratings data for this marathon to choose the timeslot for Season 3
<Evil_Spike> Oh god, this is the Trixie episode
<Phase4> math magic!
<Eli> Phase4: it was soo cool, but then, there was that enginer, he suddnely stoped, and looked at me. i was like "fuck :3"
<Barbetos> Hm. I should totally turn this channel on my tv.
<Barbetos> Yeah gona do that.
<Phase4> Eli, yeah, i'm not sure the animations are in sync on all clients
<Vikingstill> i just tryed watching this on tv and it screwed up
<DeadpoolDash> trixie time
<ekips> Trrrrixie!
<Eli> Phase4: na he just noticed, that there aren't normally any normal healthpoxes in this level. just cakes
<Jake> in germany there are 2 episodes per week both at 5:45 am
<Info_Searcher> ...? Twilight blushed a pale pink? Bit of an odd color.
<Jake> and no season 2
<Eli> boxes*
<Phase4> Eli, ah
<ekips> Jake I usually get ready for work at that time
<Phase4> MOUSTAHCE
<Jake> me too
<Jake> but its only saturday and sunday
<Phase4> oh you rainbow
<Evil_Spike> Oh rainbow
<Evil_Spike> BOO!
<Vikingstill> boo
<Phase4> NEIGH!
<ekips> I usually sleep at that time on weekends Jake :D
<FlaschenJoe11> I love how they all ignore that as a SHOW PONY, Trixie must do the whole "I AM AWESOME!" thing.
<Kandarihu> So unless they're tracking the ratings in real time and have 6 different versions of the Season 3 spot, we won't be seeing a S3 announcement today. But then again, my theory probably doesn't hold water, since S2 ran in the afternoons
<Mega_Milk> shup up and entertain me clown! >:3
<Jake> I record all the episodes instead of getting up that early
<Dragonmatte> URSAH MAJOR!
<Evil_Spike> NOT THE URSA MAJOR!
<ekips> Nouuay
<Evil_Spike> Can't they turn to Blackjack?
<Phase4> ERHMEGERD URSRMAJR
<ekips> ^
<Mega_Milk> Super strong magic = Still doing dime store side shows in random towns. And your fan boys are the d class of ponyville....yeah..
<Mozdoc> And meanwhile, Celestia is just letting this all go down.
<DerpyMuffins> Woah ponies this early in the morning?
<Phase4> whats her buisness model here
<Jake> ever noticed that trixies eyes are different from all the other mares?
<Evil_Spike> Who voiced Trixie?
<Vikingstill> equine
<Phase4> i meen thats a lot of fireworks
<ekips> Celestia likes to let her subjects solve the problems
<Phase4> someone pays for that
<Evil_Spike> LYRA!
<CrimsonPhoenix> and then PinkiePieSwear
<Vikingstill> YOU
<ekips> otherwise there wouldn't be a learning effect when Celestia just would solve everything for the ponies
<Phase4> i keep hearing trixie remixes
<Vikingstill> Oh i liked the sandlot
<Dragonmatte> BALLS!
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: The gun powder. Custom assembly. Quantity. And then theres the whole quality issue. yeah somepony is paying out the whazuu...
<Evil_Spike> Ew, Macca's
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, everyone! Watching ponies, I see. :)
<ekips> Bah!
<Evil_Spike> Yup
<Vikingstill> 8 bit ponies!
<Info_Searcher> So, I heard the mlp doll info card for Trixie has her last name on it.
<Jake> merican tv still seems strange to me
<DeadpoolDash> adventure ponies needs to be an app already
<Evil_Spike> GOLD!
<Eli> lol
<Phase4> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0837562/ << vampires that dont sparkle
<Eli> who would believe that?
<Evil_Spike> I love My Little Hub
<Dragonmatte> I hate that they're starting to sell chocolate calenders already :S
<Evil_Spike> Wat?
<Info_Searcher> Trixie Lulamoon or something like that.
<Vikingstill> AUGMENTED REALITY
<Phase4> Evil_Spike, better october than august
<Jake> wait i have the card somewhere here
<Barbetos> Lulamoon is right I believe.
<Evil_Spike> Kill it
<Dragonmatte> WHAT THE WHAT!
<Phase4> the christmast advertising started in augest last year, it was absurd
<Barbetos> Ugh. Ponies on in the morning and I get NOTHING done
<FlaschenJoe11> Rapping Care Bears?
<Vikingstill> carebears + rap = wat
<Phase4> did not stop untill a few weeks AFTER christmas
<Jake> here it is
<Jake> it says: trixie lulamoon - likes showing off!
<Evil_Spike> Ooh, fancy
<DeadpoolDash> apples
<FlaschenJoe11> And they aren't showing off?
<Eli> till when does the mare-a-ton run?
<J_E_Smith71> Eli: Three hours
<Mega_Milk> I fail to see how thats better than the amount of tail dexterity aj showed....
<Jake> the german mareathon was longer
<Vikingstill> RAAAAINNNBOOOOWWWWWSSSS
<Dragonmatte> Wohoo!
<Eli> Jake: there was a german mareathon?

<Sumica> 00,10what clothing Vikingstill?
<J_E_Smith71> By the way, Tara, John DiMaggio, and the other VA guests are doing a read of this ep at Canterlot Gardens. Hearing DiMaggio read for ponies could be hilarous
<Eli> Jake: i think they change some things when it comes to Nick swiss... sux. they don't stream ponies here
<Dragonmatte> Spike is always the sensible one
<Vikingstill> well, ponies dont normally wear clothes....
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<ekips> I don't know why but Spike moves strangely in this episode >.>
<DeadpoolDash> trixie reminds me of someone that works at a renaissance fair
<AdamTheDuck> And I just got back, why are there ponies on BronyState? This is preposterous. :$
<Evil_Spike> So do I snails
<JRPHONE> Castlevania
<J_E_Smith71> Espically if they make him do one of the female characters (Though knowing our luck they may give him Snip or Snails)
<Jake> dont you get Nick/cc ger in swiss too
<AJIsAwesome> AdamTheDuck: What? No ponies here. <_<
<Sonny> heya AJIsAwesome

<Eli> AdamTheDuck: and it just started :) first episode and it goes on for 3 hours
<DeadpoolDash> spirit bomb

<DerpyMuffins> Well, Im happy Im not an american
<Dken2021> oh yea, that marathon thingie

<Info_Searcher> I will admit. We Americans are pretty dumb. But we did make MLP.
<Vikingstill> lying is fun
<CrimsonPhoenix> AdamTheDuck, why yes...yes I did
<Rustymeat> um no...
<Evil_Spike> Agreed
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I'm glad you like it
<ekips> knowing that someone is lying is more fun Vikingstill

<pony_2304> trixie eats pinecones
<AJIsAwesome> Rustymeat: :d
<Chrysalis> vanquish it 'eh'
<Kandarihu> That said, I've seen a lot of less than intelligent ideas from non-Americans.
<Chrysalis> snails is canadian?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep
<d3rb_> Rustymeat, is it? or does her make make it appear bigger?
<Eli> Rustymeat: you should know >_><_<
<AJIsAwesome> I think so.
<Bronysith> oh boy <3
<Rustymeat> Oh yeah I do
<d3rb_> hair*
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love josh's review of this episode
<Vikingstill> WAT
<Jake> fun fact: there was a survey to count the bronies. USA is #1 canada #2 and germany is #3
<Evil_Spike> Where was Australia in that ranking?
<Rustymeat> No I think its just bigger by default
<Eli> Jake: really??
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh hey a new villain *prepare villain test*
<Barbetos> Yeah. my computer is cute. Blue screens and then it tells me my MBR is corrupt.
<Barbetos> Fucking thing
<Vikingstill> oh boy here we go
<CK|Ded> So we have a roster for Sony's Brawl clone. And it's....kinda lame.
<ekips> Zzz
<CrimsonPhoenix> Trixie: Boasting Boasting Boasting Boasting Boasting Boasting Boasting
<Jake> also there seem to be 10.000.000 in america
<pony_2304> epic wind
<Evil_Spike> Is Crash in the roster yet?
<d3rb_> nope
<PinkieSpice> anyone ever made a remix of the wind?
<Chrysalis> cows are sentient in this world
<Evil_Spike> Then I won't be buying it
<CK|Ded> Crash will never be on the roster apparently.
<Kandarihu> What bothers me the most is when the actual wisdom is flagged as stupidity.
<ekips> MOO
<Vikingstill> dontchaknow
<Chrysalis> twilight just milked MANY sentient creatures...
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, first CN and now Sony? UGH.
<CK|Ded> They've already said he won't be DLC, too.
<Evil_Spike> He'll be the last character they will announce
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, you forgot Shonen Jump too
<Vikingstill> SHES GONNA BURNOUT! (Fallout equestria)
<Barbetos> So when does twilight go ssj?
<PinkieSpice> She gonna go super nova. :U
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Well, at least they put effort in to that game. Not like.......not that cartoon network game.......
<Evil_Spike> I also played a Smash Bros type game for Gamecube today with Optimus Prime, Tyson and Bomberman
<CK|Ded> Er, no, he won't be, Evil_Spike. They've announced the full roster.
<JRPHONE> I feel dizzy
<pony_2304> is applejack a racist
<Evil_Spike> Link?
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, OH YEAH and Ubisoft
<AJIsAwesome> Evil_Spike: OH, I know what game you're talking about.
<CrimsonPhoenix> with that TMNT game
<CK|Ded> It's set at twenty characters, with future characters all being DLC. And they said Crash wouldn't be DLC, so Crash isn't getting into the game.
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Bronysith
<CK|Ded> Linked in PM.
<d3rb_> meh, parrapa the rapper is better than crash
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Bronysith
<ekips> Super Smash Bros for N64 is best
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Afternoon
<J_E_Smith71> Derpy does not approve
<Vikingstill> prepare for moustaches....
<d3rb_> hey Bronysith
<Barbetos> gallop noises
<pony_2304> that is best game
<J_E_Smith71> It's bigger, purple, and twice as ugly
<CK|Ded> It's kind of a shit roster, all told. They should have tried to share their earnings with Activision or some of these other third party companies so they could bring in the BIG names.
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1348924695703.jpg
<Barbetos> J_E_Smith71 Twilights mom?
<AJIsAwesome> I seriously do wish that Snips and Snails were punished, though.
<Barbetos> XD
<Evil_Spike> Sony, I am dissapoint
<Bronysith> dat plot
<DeadpoolDash> sony is full of dissapoint
<pony_2304> lol@bronyait
<Bronysith> wt
<Vikingstill> fu man chu
<CK|Ded> Let's consider the gaping flaws in this roster: 1) Cole MacGrath takes up two spots on the roster, instead of being a Zelda/Sheik swapper as he should be. 2) No Spyro. 3) No Crash. 4) No Snake, and he was in fricking Brawl so no excuse there.
<pony_2304> is anyone here from california
<AJIsAwesome> SO AWESOME! /)^3^(\
<J_E_Smith71> Next episode: Read It and Weep

<Nittany_Discord> You just realized that Sumica?
<AJIsAwesome> DAT REALIZATION
<Sumica> 00,10yep totaly >_>
<ekips> Sumica I have the feeling that was intentional by the authors
<Colt_Brovakiin> I bet the guy in the next bed is like "shut the hell up!"
<DeadpoolDash> ...troll...
<Dken2021> Sumica and it only took you about a few months
<pony_2304> i fucking hate that puppy show
<Kandarihu> It would be nice if there was a Daring Doo costume for Rainbow Dash in Fighting is Magic
<Forgottencrow> nice works good after clop fap trollface
<AJIsAwesome> pony_2304: Why? Seems normal to me.

<Dken2021> Kandarihu did you catch their stream? they were showing it off
<Cypresswolf> I would use that Destroyer Dome in ways it was never intended - like insect fights

<DeadpoolDash> I wonder if that hair color is daring doo's original color or the color from age
<Info_Searcher> Anyone play that leaked MLP Fighting is Magic alpha? I've seen gameplay of it. Pinkie can go Pinkamena and take out about 1/3 of her opponet's health in one hit.
