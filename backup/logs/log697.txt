<flyingace11> NOOOO!!!!!!!! But at least it will carry on through through the fans
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry they wouldn't cancel the show this early. They're making waty too much money to even consider the idea.
<fluttercry> 05,15I wonder if I photoshopped that into Hasbro's Twitter if EQD would post it
<RaveBrony> I fear....the fans work....
<flyingace11> lol
<RaveBrony> It may be good!! But easily corrupted
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03...do it
<Buytoast> they probably would
<HoodyNinja> inb4 fluttercry isn't really a fan and is just a huge troll
<superretroworld> fluttercry is joking, just to be 100% sure?
<Kandarihu> So if they're not announcing the Season 3's premier, they're close to breaking their promise.
<StinkomanFan> Oh god :D
<fluttercry> 05,15Think about it. When FiM does get cancelled, all we'll have are fan episodes like that last one
<Buytoast> hell, it'd be immediate news
<Spectrum_Rush> fluttercry: DO EET
<Buytoast> oh boy
<Buytoast> Dusk's Crappy Half-Assed Project
<Buytoast> Quality with a capital WHY
<RaveBrony> fluttercry: N...noooo ._.
<Kandarihu> fluttercry, what makes you think FiM is getting cancelled?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Dat fan episode was the most MLG thing ever, srsly. It's that bad
<fluttercry> 05,15Oh man, I want to try that Twitter thing now
<HoodyNinja> Fan ep?
<HoodyNinja> Been off for too long
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry what "last one"?
<Dken2021> fluttercryto be honest, if they would've got some better VAs and worked on the plot a bit more, it would've been ok
<J_E_Smith71> fluttercry: Well maybe we do have better ones like Double Rainboom
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<RaveBrony> HoodyNinja: If you want a good laugh, look it up :D
<Buytoast> not even morgan freeman's sezy pants soaking vocal chords could've salvaged that
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03fluttercry, if that worked, I would not be in your way when you become President of Everything
<HoodyNinja> If you want a good laugh, look up My Little Portal -_-
<RaveBrony> O.o
<RaveBrony> I will!
<Ponies47> HoodyNinja: Oh that.
<Kandarihu> I saw My Little Portal. It's good stuff.
<Canadian_Brony> Which fan episode are guys talking about?
<DerpyMuffins> Dusk Dawn
<fluttercry> 05,15You know what I hate? Pony crossovers
<RaveBrony> The bad ones :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek you still around?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Don't even get me started on the My Little Dashie movie that was realeased a while ago...
<HoodyNinja> I hate the animation, the plot, and the voice acting
<HoodyNinja> in essence, everything
<SadisticPony> -_-, if you haven't already check out rainbow factory.
<DerpyMuffins> They made a movie of that?
<RaveBrony> fluttercry: Hmm?
<Canadian_Brony> DerpyMuffins oh thank Celestia. I was getting worried you were talking about Turnabout Storm
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It wasn't even a movie at all!
<Dken2021> Scoot-Scootaloo what was it?
<Canadian_Brony> it was released?
<RaveBrony> O.o
<DerpyMuffins> How can you make a movie out of a fanfic?
<Dusky> yay, we should watch the Dusk's Dawn episode ^_^
<Canadian_Brony> Already?
<HoodyNinja> I thought that was a trailer that wasn't supposed to be a movie
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03A bunch of images
<fluttercry> 05,15Dusky NO
<superretroworld> the mlp fim ending isnt true right?
<fluttercry> 05,15We already suffered that once
<Dusky> fluttercry: but why?
<RaveBrony> ^
<fluttercry> 05,15superretroworld That's what I read. Sorry
<Dusky> see, RaveBrony agrees!
<HoodyNinja> superretroworld: Never
<Kandarihu> fluttercry, I just looked at The Hub's facebook page (and I'm kicking myself for even touching FB). The image IS from there.
<RaveBrony> No, rofl!
<Dusky> :p
<superretroworld> thats okay
<Dusky> RaveBrony: but it's such a good laugh
<RaveBrony> Ive seen it twice now :D
<RaveBrony> It just hurts, hahaha
<DerpyMuffins> I had the luck of not seeing Dusk Dawn
<Dusky> just steals the septor with a stretcheer
*Dusky isn't sober \o/
<DerpyMuffins> Was on too late when mods streamed it
<DeadpoolDash> is this 2 or 1?
<DerpyMuffins> So glad I was
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo oh, I know which one you're talking about. Yeah, there are dozens of "MLD Movies" that are really slide shows, but an actual movie, as in MOTION PICTURES, is in develoment.
*HoodyNinja is wondering why hes sober
<Dusky> apparently 1 beer is all ti takes
<Dusky> >_<
<DerpyMuffins> Weakling
<Kandarihu> Alright guys. If the premier is before the election, I'm calling off my pony fast... or maybe I'll make an exception for ONLY new episodes as they air.
<fluttercry> 05,15MLD is a movie? my god what has this world become
<Dusky> DerpyMuffins: well, the last time I was drunk there was a network attack that I was too drunk to defend against
<DerpyMuffins> Would you vote for a president just because he is a brony?
<HoodyNinja> fluttercry: Don't be a hipster
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DerpyMuffins: No.
<sub06905|BF3> zombie bullshit!
<fluttercry> 05,15HoodyNinja not my fault it's bad
<HoodyNinja> Is he white?
<Dusky> and the time before that my campsite got raided by a wolf that I couldn't scare off
<Dusky> so I don't usually drink
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DerpyMuffins: Why would I do that just because we share the same interests?
<DerpyMuffins> As much as I want, I cant get drunk anymore....
<Dusky> but getting kidnapped out to super by my mother's bf kinda qualifies as a time IU need a drink
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry an actual movie is being made. I'm not talking pictures either. People are going out of their way to shoot a legitimate movie out of the fan-fic.
<fluttercry> 05,15Canadian_Brony what a shame.
<Canadian_Brony> . . .
<flyingace11> Who is streaming?
<Ponies47> fluttercry: You think that's bad? Just wait for the Brony Thank You Commerical for when Season 3 comes around. I SAW it at Canterlot Gardens
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Shizu/
<DerpyMuffins> Whats teh budget?
<Buytoast> wait
<Buytoast> dare i ask what fanfic?
<fluttercry> 05,15MLD Buytoast
<DerpyMuffins> MLD
<fluttercry> 05,15MLD
<Buytoast> if it's that ovverated dashie thing
<Buytoast> godadmmit
<Canadian_Brony> Buytoast My Little Dashie
<Kandarihu> My Little Dashie
<fluttercry> 05,15I know right?
<HoodyNinja> ;~;
<Dken2021> Ponies47 hwo bad was it?
<DerpyMuffins> MLD is overrated now
*HoodyNinja liked MLD
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<Buytoast> oh god
<Buytoast> the thank you commercial
<Buytoast> it hurts
<fluttercry> 05,15Next thing you know they'll be binding and selling Fallout: Equestria OH WAIT THEY DID
<Ponies47> Dken2021: Shush. That would be spoiling it
<Buytoast> it hurts it hurts it hurts
<StinkomanFan> MY LITTLE DASHY, MY LITTLE DASHY, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<DerpyMuffins> I heard a fan gave a MLP VA a copy of that
<RaveBrony> I enjoyed MLD!! but i hate how everyone has blown it out of proportion
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<StinkomanFan> MY LITTLE DASHY, I used to wonder what depression could be
<fluttercry> 05,15MLD is overated and crap
<Ponies47> I'm not saying anything about The Brony Thank You Commerical.
<Marx> Oh hey, Left 4 Dead.
<StinkomanFan> Until you shared it's magic with me
<Shizuka> 13see
<Ponies47> Ya'll will have to wait
*SpadeMagnes[R] uses a Bat Creditcard
<Shizuka> 13you guys think i wouldn't help my teammates
<HoodyNinja> I think you guys are just mad that this isn't an inside joke thing anymore, that or you just don't like fan fiction
<Shizuka> 13but would YOU help your teammates if they were this dumb?
<Buytoast> shoot them all dead Shizuka
<Buytoast> you can do it
<Buytoast> and noone would know
<flyingace11> no
<DerpyMuffins> Not really Shizuka
<fluttercry> 05,15AIs don't deserve life
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> SpadeMagnes[R]: ...........
<HoodyNinja> brony thank you was a fail
<HoodyNinja> all a fail
<Marx> Anyway, I'm a little late hearing this, but I saw the EQD post about tomorrow's Big News.
<Marx> Whatever it is, I am freaking ready.
<fluttercry> 05,15HoodyNinja I dislike fanfiction, but I especially dislike MLD
<RaveBrony> Brony thank you?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Marx: Big News tomorrow?
<HoodyNinja> inb4 they were bought out be e3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Knowing how EQD would I really enjoy what big news they show?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *is
<HoodyNinja> by EA
<HoodyNinja> *
<RaveBrony> I...dont like reading...so...im not a fan of fanfiction :I
<HoodyNinja> fail :P
<Barbetos> My dad is awesome .
<Barbetos> That is all
<RaveBrony> wut?
<fluttercry> 05,15I love reading and that's why I hate fanfiction
<Kandarihu> Well, they're AIs. They only shoot as straight as they're allowed to be, and their tactics are only as sound as their designed to be.
<Ponies47> My dad is ok. he can just be a bully when it comes to school ._.
<RaveBrony> fluttercry: Poor writing?
<DerpyMuffins> I realized I bought Skyrim 3 days ago and still havent touched it
<HoodyNinja> My dad is a jobless loser
<HoodyNinja> but I still love him
<fluttercry> 05,15No creativity. make you own damn world. Don't be lazy
<RaveBrony> Only reading I do on my own is reading microwave cooking directions :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh come on there are some good fanfictions
<AVS619> lol
<fluttercry> 05,15lol no there aren't
<DerpyMuffins> I heared Past Sins was good
<thelonepony> I love my dad, but he loses fate on me ._.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You're acting like every single one is bad... and how do you know that
<Buytoast> i don't know what i'm ashamed of more
<flyingace11> BACKGROUND PONY, AND FAMILIES
<fluttercry> 05,15Because every single one I've read or that has been presented as a "Really good one" has sucked terribly
<superretroworld> DerpyMuffins: its not really a fun game
<Buytoast> the fact that i've actually written some or the fact taht i had one on Sir Dragonfister's Plateau of Horse Shinanigans
<DerpyMuffins> Pinkie watches paint dry was great
<HoodyNinja> I'm just gonna step away from this fan fic argument
<soulrider95> fluttercry: what about stuff like antipodes? it take the world, changes it, and adds new characters
<DerpyWhooves> WOW! LOOK AT THOSE PIXELS!
<HoodyNinja> my face hurts
<fluttercry> 05,15Still not their own world
<J_E_Smith71> fluttercry: Does that apply to just MLP fanfiction, or fanfics in general (Like the Sonic fanfics that Dan Drazen wrote)?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> fluttercry: Oh god could you sound anymore of a ass right now?
<Barbetos> Wtf internet.
<DerpyWhooves> Wat is he doin'?
<fluttercry> 05,15J_E_Smith71 fanfiction in general. SpadeMagnes[R] Just being honest
<Barbetos> Google image search
<DeadpoolDash> I liked the "Twilight War" fluttercry, but that is mostly cause I liked the military aspects of it. Too bad it never got finished.
<Barbetos> Why
<HoodyNinja> fluttercry: is that all you care about?
<Barbetos> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzlyscTLPK1qksdgwo2_500.jpg
<RaveBrony> Oh damn
<Buytoast> WAH someone doesn't like what i like they're an ass WAH
<Barbetos> What the fuck is wrong with that pic that I posted?
<DerpyWhooves> Oh look, he's dying.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Barbetos: WUT
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Buytoast: No the problem is their being negative as fuck
<Barbetos> I don't know!
<StinkomanFan> Y'know a REALLY controvercial fanfic?
<Shizuka> 13he?
*Barbetos cries
<fluttercry> 05,15I have the right to be negative
<Buytoast> negativity is a part of reality
<Buytoast> you can't just ignore it
<StinkomanFan> The Conversion Bureau
<soulrider95> fluttercry: most books dont even create their own world anyways. Stuff like Tom Clancy takes place on the earth. Does that mean Clancy books are bad?
<HoodyNinja> Hes not really being negative
<Canadian_Brony> The biggest problem I see in fanfictions is originality. And I'm not talking about what fluttercry is saying. A lot of fanfictions I find tell the same stories over and over and over. Take "Human in Equestria" stories. "HiE" and "original" is non-existent.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well there has to be good stuff out there, your acting like every single one in exsistence is horrible
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, but you can fight it
<DerpyMuffins> Good to see Shizuka helping her teammates
<Buytoast> why fight it?
<fluttercry> 05,15Real life isn't the same as another fictional world that was already created by someone else
<Buytoast> in fact
<Buytoast> Why contain it?
<DerpyWhooves> Do people type "fluttercry: " themselves or do they do something else?
<Kandarihu> Negativity is an attitude, not a reality
<HoodyNinja> Canadian_Brony: Originality? In fan fiction?
<Buytoast> are you saying attitudes don;t exist?
<HoodyNinja> IT"S ALL ABOUT THE SHIPS
<superretroworld> fluttercry: do you mean someone like avatar, pocahontas and dances with wolves having the same stories?
<RaveBrony> Its more like stubborn, but i would like to stay out of dis
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Type part of their name, and push tab DerpyWhooves.
<soulrider95> fluttercry: well Its the same to me. They are both taking a pre-existing world (earth, equestria) and adding their own twist to it.
<fluttercry> 05,15superretroworld yeah sort of.
<moobull69> binders, full of women
<Kandarihu> DerpyWhooves, I type part of his name and tab
<DerpyWhooves> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Thanks.
<DeadpoolDash> Episodes 1-3 of Star Wars are the best is examples of horrible fan fiction.
<Canadian_Brony> DerpyWhooves no. You begin to type out a nick and hit 'tab' to finish it. If the right nick doesn't come up at first, hit it until you get it.
<Brad> DerpyWhooves, type the first few characters of a username then hit tab
<Brad> oops beat me to it.
<Pink3> What game is this>
<RaveBrony> L4D
<DerpyWhooves> Left 4 Dead
<thelonepony> moobull69: My god, you been gone for a lomg time
<thelonepony> long*
<Ponies47|Shower> BRB shower
<DerpyMuffins> People always get my name wrong tho
<Canadian_Brony> HoodyNinja extremely rare, and almost doesn't exist in HiE.
<RaveBrony> Ponies47|Shower: Covers the cameras!
<Pink3> O i didnt reconize it, i want it really bad
<moobull69> sometimes, I hurt my foot on monday, and haven't been doing much
<DerpyWhooves> People always do "Derpy_hooves" for me.
<DerpyWhooves> o_O
<HoodyNinja> Canadian_Brony: Than don't write/read any
<HoodyNinja> get yo own ideas
<Canadian_Brony> DerpyWhooves it's called a 'tab-fail'.
<HoodyNinja> I got my own ideas
<DerpyWhooves> I'm going to write a fanfic right now.
<DerpyWhooves> brb
<DerpyMuffins> Originality is difficult to find on Fim
<Brad> I dont like any sort of fanfiction.
<flyingace11> true
<DerpyMuffins> Most people just write about OCs and shit
<RaveBrony> "Here's a touching story"
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Not everything has to be 100% origional you know...
<DerpyMuffins> I hate OC fics
<flyingace11> BP and families aregood though
<fluttercry> 05,15SpadeMagnes[R] um...why not?
<Buytoast> DIS MY OC WHIP WIGGLE HE OWN WHIP AND CATERPILLAR
<Buytoast> SHIP NOW PLS
<HoodyNinja> I like fics with OCs in them, but not fics ABOUT OCs
<fluttercry> 05,15MY OC IS A ALLICORN AND SHE IS BETTER THAN CELESTIA
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Because you cant fucking expect everything not to have something used befofre in it
<thelonepony> I hate Mary sues
<fluttercry> 05,15I can expect the world/characters/plot to be though
<DeadpoolDash> ...isn't all of FiM fanfiction(Lauren Faust is a MLP fan)
<PeachStreak> SO MANY F******* ALICORNS!!!!!!!!!! FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<RaveBrony> My OC...is me ponified...i dont even plan to do anything with it :D
<HoodyNinja> fluttercry: YOU ARE NOT THE THIRD SISTER
<Canadian_Brony> HoodyNinja I read fanfictions, but I'm able to weed through them and find the ones that appeal to me.
<fluttercry> 05,15Sure there are tropes and cliches but that's different
<Canadian_Brony> thelonepony don't we all?
<RaveBrony> No more L4D? D:
<Shizuka> 13what to do
<HoodyNinja> My OC is an earth pony ;~;
<DerpyMuffins> Shizuka streaming all she can before she leaves
<Shizuka> 13eeyup
<Buytoast> maybe i should reinstall L4D one of these days
<DerpyMuffins> For the weekend
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Shizuka: Bill Nye?
<HoodyNinja> stream-o-thon
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Tetris
<Buytoast> then again
<Kandarihu> I'm working on my own sci-fi franchise, but I'm thinking up my own FiM fanfic as well.
<HoodyNinja> tl2
<thelonepony> Didi you draw your OC HoodyNinja ?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I request tetris
<Buytoast> Coach is quite endearing
<thelonepony> Did*
<HoodyNinja> thelonepony: actually yes
<fluttercry> 05,15I vote Spongebob
<StinkomanFan> Shizuka should stream the Riftrax for Spiderman three :|
<thelonepony> Could i see it :3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03You should draw a pony, Shizu!
<HoodyNinja> We should watch MLP
<Shizuka> 13scoot you do not want to see my drawing fail..
<DeadpoolDash> draw a sea pony
<HoodyNinja> G1
<Kandarihu> Just keep in mind that I'm 34, so it's going to be less Mary-Sue-oriented.
<RaveBrony> I vote for a tutorial on how to bake bread!!
<DerpyMuffins> How about we do something Shizuka likes....
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03You should bake a cake, then!
<thelonepony> ^^^
<taoumi> magnets
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The cake is a lie
<taoumi> so we can know how the ywork

<DeadpoolDash> this movie failed because of Batman syndrome...too many villians
<Canadian_Brony> derpy_face Emo Parker
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> sub06905|BF3: :D
<DerpyWhooves> derpy_face: ARE YOU SERIOUS
<flutterchu> you do knoe you guys and just easily type "flutt" and then it will go to flutterchu, the delete the C H and then press R and then TAB........it's not hard
<superretroworld> SpadeMagnes[R]: o.O

<thelonepony> sub06905|BF3: :D
<derpy_face> >.>
<StinkomanFan> I LOVE villians
<twilight_sprinkle> im just here for breeead :3
<CriticKitten> The dual villain thing is honestly not the biggest flaw in the film.
<DerpyWhooves> derpy_face: Spiderman 3 "rifftrax"
<DerpyMuffins> Bread theif
<HoodyNinja> Joker is the best villian
<HoodyNinja> eveah
<naturesfury> ^^
<thelonepony> ^^^
<Canadian_Brony> also, hi derpy_face
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The next spiderman movie needs the lizard
<thelonepony> hi derpy_face :)
<Kurra> flutterr
<derpy_face> oh ive seen this movie 4 times lol
<DeadpoolDash> if they had just one villian they could have written a way better story
<derpy_face> but hello
<CriticKitten> SpadeMagnes[R]: Wish granted.
<DerpyWhooves> "Daddy was just breaking and entering, sweetheart."
<superretroworld> dont tell me rifftrax did a titanic commentary?
<HoodyNinja> SpadeMagnes[R]: It... has the lizard
<DeadpoolDash> instead of this disjointed piece of crap
<Canadian_Brony> superretroworld they did..
<Shizuka> 13superretroworld: was the first one i streamed
<Shizuka> 13at like 3 in the morning >>
<Kurra> flutterchu, that just makes me type flutterr o.o
<derpy_face> funny thing is ima go because ive seen the movie 4 times and btw he dies in the end
<derpy_face> bye everypony
<Kurra> heeh
<Canadian_Brony> and I still wasn't able to get through it
<flutterchu> am i the only one-(no offense) who think's that Rifftrax isnt funny
<DerpyWhooves> Am I the only one who thinks this is the best Spiderman movie?
<Canadian_Brony> g'nigh derpy_face
<superretroworld> how could they do that?
<thelonepony> Bye derpy_face :)
<fluttercry> 05,15They also did a Matrix one which I hear is very funny
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Just misunderstood
<Canadian_Brony> DerpyWhooves do you like it legit or for guilty pleasure?
<Shizuka> 13and the matrixes i streamed at the start of trilogy summer
<StinkomanFan> >Nuke a facility
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So how did the Sandman get his powers?
<fluttercry> 05,15I missed them ;___;
<DerpyWhooves> Canadian_Brony: Uh, legit?
<CriticKitten> SpadeMagnes[R]: Keep watching.
<StinkomanFan> >"I did nothing wrong!"
<Kurra> Marlee Matlin wat cx
<superretroworld> Shizuka: oh yeah i remember you saying that
<HoodyNinja> SpadeMagnes[R]: DO YOU NOT WATCH THESE MOVIES
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I only saw the first two
<CriticKitten> Oh that reminds me of a long boring story that will only make you feel guilty!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Never bothered to see the third
<Canadian_Brony> DerpyWhooves then you're in the hipster crowd.
<Kurra> HoodyNinja, I don't know how Sandman got his powers either :p
<DerpyMuffins> Aunt May isnt that old
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra keep watching
<Kurra> okay.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> BUFFER!
<CriticKitten> lol
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] not for me
<HoodyNinja> He fell into a bunch of sand during some nuclear testing
<CriticKitten> It's funny because it's totally true. >_>
<Panda|Homework> Ok... this is late.... Lyra` why did you paint me on SB's toe nails? >.>
<naturesfury> the same way every other super powered person gets there powers. in the most bullshit way possible
<HoodyNinja> and his dna mixed with the sand
<StinkomanFan> ...Aunt May has Zecora's Nightmare Night wig on
<superretroworld> he sounds like gigabit
<HoodyNinja> l
<sub06905|BF3> i miss uncle ben ;3;
<HoodyNinja> my thing froze
<Kurra> SuperBrony has pony on his toenails?
<Dken2021> don't we all sub06905|BF3
<DerpyMuffins> Uncle Ben died right?
<Kurra> I wanna see a pic :)
<twilight_sprinkle> yep DerpyMuffins
<DerpyWhooves> DerpyMuffins: eyup
<SpadeMagnes[R]> God damn it stream stop buffering...I hate this computer
<superretroworld> do they have kids?
<Buytoast> uncle ben is on cold rice right now
<CriticKitten> Dat pointless guilt trip
<DerpyMuffins> So they never bothered to explain Peter's parents?
<HoodyNinjuh> chat derp
<Barbetos> Hrm.
<DerpyWhooves> Peter's parents are dead.
<DerpyMuffins> I know that
<Barbetos> Would 4 60gb from OCZ in raid 0 be worth it?
<HoodyNinjuh> is this thing on?
<Kurra> .... v.v
<naturesfury> they were shot in a ally when they were coming out of a movie theater
<CriticKitten> lol
<Barbetos> I would in up paying 120 bucks for that
<Barbetos> ... Naaaah
<CriticKitten> Man, if only he had some kind of sense to detect incoming danger
<Barbetos> Answered my own question
<superretroworld> i remember the camera being worse then this
<CriticKitten> Dat surfboard
<fluttercry> 05,15Still not as bad as a Bourne camera
<twilight_sprinkle> you didnt read the email i sent you?-i, skimmed it..
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So is there any good reason Harry is doing this? besides blind rage?
<CriticKitten> Didn't you get the email explaining the situation? Harry's one of MJ's seven evil exes
<DerpyMuffins> I thought Spider-man made his own web shooters
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] nnope
<DeadpoolDash> Bay cameras are the worst
<Canadian_Brony> DerpyMuffins not in this trilogy
<SpadeMagnes[R]> SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
<CriticKitten> Welp
<HoodyNinja> This computer sucks~
<CriticKitten> Dat symbolism
<twilight_sprinkle> DerpyMuffins: he makes them through chemistry afaik
<Barbetos> for 120 though the load times in a 4 ssd raid 0 would be amazing.
<Barbetos> Thats for sure
<HoodyNinja> fo shizzle
<fluttercry> 05,15James Franco vision...it's probably very purple
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<fluttercry> 05,15if you know what I'm saying
<SpadeMagnes[R]> If I recall Harry didnt like his father that much didnt he?
<Barbetos> I mean. compaters are cool herp der nerd stuff
<CriticKitten> Well it's a good thing no one is looking at Peter as he swings along AT GROUND LEVEL IN PLAIN VIEW OF EVERYONE
<Kurra> can you load an OS through striped raid?
<Canadian_Brony> for a sec, I thought I heard one of those cartoon "neeeeuuuuh" sounds . . . that was a bad onomatopoeia
<DerpyWhooves> CriticKitten: So true.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> BAT RANG
<Canadian_Brony> yes, Black Flies are stupidly annoying
<DerpyWhooves> Black Flies?
<RaveBrony> Owned
<SpadeMagnes[R]> TRIP LINE
<CriticKitten> LOL
<StinkomanFan> PWNED
<Kurra> Clotheslined!
<HoodyNinja> sounds like a minecraft bow...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> ITS A TRAP
<twilight_sprinkle> hydroman was OP though
<twilight_sprinkle> didnt hydroman kill mary jane
<HoodyNinja> FREAKAZOID~
<RaveBrony> HARRY! :[
<Kurra> these guys *are* just humans....
<HoodyNinja> FREAKAZOID~
<CriticKitten> Jason!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ok who here would actually check a villian's body to see if they were actually dead up close?
<CriticKitten> Jaaaaaaason!
<Buytoast> harry pumped himself up with joker venom and shit
<Kurra> I would, and prolly get killed.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Or would you shoot them to make sure
<HoodyNinja> SpadeMagnes[R]: I wouldn't
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I would shoot them
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Just to make sure...
<Canadian_Brony> DerpyWhooves giant flies that live up in the Territories. They hibernate for over 11 1/2 months of the year. When they wake up, they start swarming and try to eat your flesh.
<HoodyNinja> shoot him twice just to make sure
<Kurra> Zefram Cochrane!
<fluttercry> 05,15That'll do pig
<CriticKitten> Did you catch that, folks?>
<fluttercry> 05,15That'll do
<HoodyNinja> I swear if my chat broke again
<CriticKitten> "The guy we tied to the Ben Parker homicide"
<SpadeMagnes[R]> CURSEES A FENCE
<CriticKitten> Yes, because Uncle Ben's death needed an extra retcon
<DerpyWhooves> Canadian_Brony: Well, then...
<HoodyNinja> fuck it
<twilight_sprinkle> he just climbed over a barbed fence lul
<Kurra> o.o
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You know what this needs?
<Kurra> ooh
<SpadeMagnes[R]> More sand
<CriticKitten> So let's get this straight
<Kurra> ...a plasma converter?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WHY DONT THEY CHECK
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] idiots
<Barbetos> Anyone want to see the build I just made up and geek out about it with me? :3
<doctor_whooves127> polt device new york is just caulk full of them
<Canadian_Brony> duh
<HoodyNinja> SpadeMagnes[R]: MORE sand? We're surrounded by sand!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh its just a bird, obviously nothing
<SpadeMagnes[R]> HoodyNinja: You know just two cubic tons
<Kurra> what are they...
<Kurra> what?
<StinkomanFan> THE WORLD'S GREATEST TOTHBRUSH!
<CriticKitten> They have this nuclear testing facility just outside of New York City
<CriticKitten> Guarded ONLY by a barbed wire fence
<Kurra> what is this thing?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: how is it nuclear
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So how imcompitent are these scientists?
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra never explained what, exactly, they were originally doing.
<CriticKitten> And yet they believe that the facility is secure enough that "it's probably just a bird" in that sand pile.
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] extremely
<Kurra> How annoying. o.ó
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: still not as bad as the chernobyl scientists
<SpadeMagnes[R]> If you saw a disturbance in a experiment like this would you go check it?
<Canadian_Brony> yes
<HoodyNinja> SpadeMagnes[R]: Do you have any idea how much two cubic tons of sand is?
<Kurra> Canadian_Brony, even though it isn't, I say it's a plasma converter.
<DerpyWhooves> This is hilarious.
<HoodyNinja> I really hate this computer~
<doctor_whooves127> did you know that he now works like a swarm of bees there is one grian of sand that is basically the queen
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: The facility is nuclear powered IIRC. Or at the very least it's powered under questionable means. :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And why exactly do they have a facility like that guarded by a sole chainlink fence?
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra again, we are never told what it is, so I just say "Fuck it. This is Spiderman 3."
<CriticKitten> Gotta love plot devices!
<Canadian_Brony> . . .
<Kurra> *whine* ;;
<CriticKitten> Yes, this is happening. XD
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: i dont remember nuclear power being mentioned, there are other power engines besides nuclear
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So what the hell were they doing with the sand?
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: its easiest to jump too
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] never explained.
<twilight_sprinkle> i need to ask you guys to scootaloo
<Buytoast> i'm guessing the sand was just for a base
<HoodyNinja> SpadeMagnes[R]: Mass glass production
<CriticKitten> Actually, my bad, it's a fission reactor
<SpadeMagnes[R]> ROCKS
<CriticKitten> But w/e. Experimental power, nuclear, whatever. :P
<doctor_whooves127> sand
<Spectrum_Rush> sand actually
<twilight_sprinkle> a fission reactor is basically a nuclear reactor
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Lets not take them for granite
<StinkomanFan> Robot Rocks?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: how do you know its a fission reactor though
<Canadian_Brony> HoodyNinja yes, because heat is too mainstream *pushes up Hipster glasses*
<Kurra> stream compression is officially DED
<fluttercry> 05,15Dr.Dune
<fluttercry> 05,15lol
<DerpyWhooves> Son of a beach.
<naturesfury> owilolicios?
<Kurra> DED :[
<CriticKitten> They're using fission on the particle accelerator, IIRC.
<Canadian_Brony> dat obvious CGI
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont remember anything about fission being mentioned
<Kurra> anmating sand has to be hell on earth to do
<CriticKitten> So basically he's Imhotep
<HoodyNinja> dat Hoody not caring
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Cats love him
<CriticKitten> Except not as cool
<SpadeMagnes[R]> CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS
<Canadian_Brony> and he's all like "I'm sand. Cool."
<DerpyMuffins> Mr. Sandman
<DerpyWhooves> xD
<fluttercry> 05,15look at all that CG
<doctor_whooves127> ok how did the necklace servive?
<Spectrum_Rush> now how did that not get fused to him or messed up
<Ponies47> Bum bum bum bum
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Awwww
<naturesfury> this one scene took longer for the animators than the rest of the movie combined. true fact lookk it up in the xtras of the movie
<DerpyWhooves> doctor_whooves127: Tru dat
<CriticKitten> XD
<Kurra> if that was me, I think I'd just let my form go. forever.
<CriticKitten> Good point, why isn't he HORRIFIED at this?
<Squallken> sad scene
<Kurra> and just be sand, and scatter to the oceans.
<Canadian_Brony> If that was me, I'd panic.
<Canadian_Brony> Then panic some more.
<Canadian_Brony> Faint.
<Canadian_Brony> And then go back to panicking.
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: XD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Canadian_Brony: Get a drink....panic some more
<Canadian_Brony> Did I mention I would panic?
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] XD
<DerpyWhooves> Why does everyone complain about this movie?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> HARSH
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Just....ouch
<CriticKitten> DerpyWhooves: Keep watching.
<HoodyNinja> Canadian_Brony: I'll have the chicken salad. THEY'LL DESTROY IT ALL!
<Shizuka> 13spider man, spider man, whines just like a teenage kid
<CriticKitten> This movie follows the Eva rule
<DerpyWhooves> CriticKitten: I own this on DVD.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> HoodyNinja: DESTROY IT ALL
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka hey, I don't whine :(

<Buytoast> how wasn't spiderman kaboinging gwen stacy in teh comics?
<Buytoast> well i guess that answered me
<fluttercry> 05,15This is all true by the way
<DeadpoolDash> yep
<fluttercry> 05,15Spidey forgot how physics worked and killed Gwen
<CriticKitten> Your daughter / his girlfriend is about to fall to her death, and you're like "meh, shit happens"
<StinkomanFan> Haha more ANGST
<Buytoast> and the innocence of comics died with her or something
<DeadpoolDash> gwen stacy should have been in the first movie...and died
<HoodyNinja> He's a cop... of course he's there
<Panda|Homework> CriticKitten perfect parenting.
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry *sigh* stupid physics.
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah, that was a huge moment because the Hero never fails
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dick
<Spectrum_Rush> I like Gwen from Amazing Spiderman better
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Do you find it more able to get into a story if the hero fails every so often?
<DerpyWhooves> I haven't seen "The Amazing Spiderman" yet, is it good?
<DeadpoolDash> gwen should die in the next movie
<fluttercry> 05,15Best character in these movies

<CriticKitten> Sorry, that cameo was too blunt.
<Buytoast> ha
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ohey Stan Lee.

<CriticKitten> .....
<CriticKitten> Forgot about that bit of dumb.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is Sandman stupid enough to not change his clothes?
<doctor_whooves127> hes a ninja
<Canadian_Brony> he may be best dork, but I am best nerd *pushes up glasses*
<DeadpoolDash> campbell is the doorman i think...or is it waiter in this one?
<CriticKitten> SpadeMagnes: He's made of sand, why not change his facial features entirely?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WHY WOULD YOU GO IN HERE

<DeadpoolDash> sandy vag
<CriticKitten> IMHOTEP!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Never take this guy to a beach
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: i dont think he expected a giant sand monster
<fluttercry> 05,15NYPD is one of the most inaccurate police forces in the US
<fluttercry> 05,15The more you know
<CriticKitten> Remember, kids, giant piles of sand blow like clouds in the wind
<SpadeMagnes[R]> How did she not die from the force of falling that far?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Even IF spidy caught her
<Kurra> fluttercry, inaccurate? As in shooting?
<fluttercry> 05,15yup
<Kurra> dear heavens.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I may have miss heard her but HOW far did she say she fell?
<Kurra> Funny, their bullets seem to racial profile though, no?
<CriticKitten> SpadeMagnes: In the comics, Spidey saved Gwen from a fall off a bridge, but her neck snapped.
<twilight_sprinkle> 60 ft i think?
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry who is more inaccurate: NYPD or Stormtroopers?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> HOW IS SHE NOT DEAD
<fluttercry> 05,15Read that bit of info after they shot a bunch of civilians by accident a few months ago
<CriticKitten> SpadeMagnes: This movie? Nope, just raw stupid. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: because spiderman caught her
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Being caught regardless she would have died from force of stopping
<Kurra> I heard about that shooting.
<Canadian_Brony> . . .
<Canadian_Brony> wow
<VenHur> Hello, we're watching Spiderman numbah three-ie?
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: not if she was slowed down into it
<Kurra> She'd have to withstand maybe 10Gs...
<Canadian_Brony> VenHur eeyup

<Kurra> Peter's Batman voice is plain laughable
<CriticKitten> ....are you sure that isn't Matthew Patel?
<Chachamuffin> If sandman got hit with water, that means he is moldable and can be made into a sandman castle
<Canadian_Brony> ohai Scoot-Scootaloo. Are you sure you want to miss Emo Parker?

<ASoftFluffyThing> Ladies and gentlemen, Peter Parker just showed emotion. Let's give him a hand.
*ASoftFluffyThing slowly claps
<Shizuka> 13wooooo
<Buytoast> now wasn't the landlord a complete asshat in the second movie?
<CriticKitten> Let's wait and see if he does any evil dances. Then we'll know he's Patel.
*AJIsAwesome|Busy sarcastically claps
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He showed emotion... MOVIE RUINED
<Shizuka> 13more emotion than keanu reeves so far
<Kurra> but emo never was hipster. I would think hipster has too much dignity....?
<Chachamuffin> There is a BIG differance between a hipster and emo.:P
<CriticKitten> Woh.
<naturesfury> ha
<Canadian_Brony> I don't rage about doors. I rage about the stupid doorways because I stub my damn toe on it.

<doctor_whooves127> you mean the breakup bridge?
<Kurra> Not yet ASoftFluffyThing
<Canadian_Brony> [OC]ShadowQuill no, but I considered putting it on my "Read Later" list. And by "Read Later", I actually mean "Nag myself to read this every once in a while but never get around to it".
<CriticKitten> Incoming cliche: breakup on a bridge :D
<[OC]ShadowQuill> Tobey Maguire: The only man who looks like he is happy whilst crying
<Canadian_Brony> turtles
<SpadeMagnes[R]> OUCH
<Canadian_Brony> [OC]ShadowQuill IKR?
<[OC]ShadowQuill> Canadian_Brony: BUT THOU MUST READ IT.

<Megalomanic> He failed the polygraph.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He has to protect the city you stupid bitch!
<[OC]ShadowQuill> Dickovitch
<SpadeMagnes[R]> HE HAS A JOB
<[OC]ShadowQuill> ?
<CriticKitten> Please, please don't say that. I can do better, I can act!
<doctor_whooves127> she should just off handadly mention the goblin
<Spectrum_Rush> got damn it Peter http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/ManUp.jpg

<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk, the trees in the background!
<CriticKitten> Whooooooooore~
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: Exactly.
<Canadian_Brony> >it could be a chick
<[OC]ShadowQuill> Mary Jane could have been less stupid.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So why did Mary Jane not talk this over?
<twilight_sprinkle> shes protecting him
<doctor_whooves127> breakup point
<Canadian_Brony> that /might/ make the movie interesting
<ASoftFluffyThing> SpadeMagnes[R], being blackmailed (?)
<Canadian_Brony> but it's overly doubtful
<DerpyMuffins> So Harry is the fall back guy?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Or not try hinting she's being blackmailed?
<Kurra> fffffffff.
<Kurra> o.o
<XaviortheSavior> owch
<SpadeMagnes[R]> DUMB BITCH
<doctor_whooves127> coff harry's evil coff

<Buytoast> blunter than a baseball bat
<naturesfury> lol...
<CriticKitten> xD
<[OC]ShadowQuill> >Spaghetti falls out of Peter's pockets >His Face When http://derpy.me/L7Bw1
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<SpadeMagnes[R]> twilight_sprinkle: She could have sort of hinted she was being blackmailed to know she didnt mean it
<XaviortheSavior> i'm evil btw
<DeadpoolDash> everyone is evil in this movie...except Sandman who is just there
<Canadian_Brony> and then he's hitting on the waitress?
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: like i said, shes protecting him, she doesnt want him to get killed over her
<Ryunosuke> so apparently there is "big news" coming from the Hub tommorow... but they wont tell us what it is

<CriticKitten> Yep.

<[Alpha]> I was going to get a Derpy shirt today but the only sizes they had could only fit a tank :/
<Spectrum_Rush> ok that was actually pretty smooth
<ASoftFluffyThing> Peter used Charm. It's...uh....effective to a point?

<[Alpha]> SPY
<CriticKitten> If you waaaaaant to fight him~
<CriticKitten> You're not the briiiiightest~
<DeadpoolDash> by the way, in the real story spider-man proved on of brock's stories wrong by capturing the real criminal and then brock got fired and his wife left him, he then was going to commit suicide at the church, but the symbiote was there and shared the same hatred for spider-man as brock and they became Venom
<Spectrum_Rush> no no its the wrong kind of swag
<ASoftFluffyThing> Peter used Attention-Seeking Douche. It's....
<Dj_Cyber-4G> wow parker is a douche
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So a unknown side effect of the symbiote is it can make you dance really well?
<Buytoast> none can resist Spiderman's Spidermoves
<Canadian_Brony> This is not swag. This is . . . gawd, I have no idea what the hell this is.

<thelonepony> Hi oni_link|sick
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So when did the symbiote make you dance like a boss?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> LOL THIS IS HALARIOUS
*Kurra casts Regen on oni_link|sick
<thelonepony> How sick are you :(
<Spectrum_Rush> symbolism
<Buytoast> the Spidershank redemption
<DeadpoolDash> plus brock was a bit of a body builder as well, this enhanced his strength as venom since the symbiote multiplies the users strength by some various number
<doctor_whooves127> this is the only thing they got right
<SpadeMagnes[R]> ANNNNNNNNNNNNGSSSSSSSSTTTT
<Squallken> I missed the worst scene in the movie :(
<Canadian_Brony> oni_link|sick ouch, I hope you feel better soon. it's better than throwing up, amiright?
<oni_link|sick> hey thelonepony , enough to have missed work
<CriticKitten> Suicide
<Petrified_Discord> Well if it's church and then steeple, then the next step would be to look inside and...you know what, nevermind. :/
<Canadian_Brony> Squallken isn't that a good thing?
<CriticKitten> Oh, damn.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Where the fuck is Shocker
<oni_link|sick> Canadian_Brony: yeah barfing would have been the worst :(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I want Shocker damn it
<naturesfury> shocker isent in this movie
<CriticKitten> SpadeMagnes: Sir not appearing in this film
<Buytoast> BUT HE IS IN THE GAME!
<Dj_Cyber-4G> OH MY GOD THIS IS HALARIOUS
<oni_link|sick> Kurra: It missed O,O
<Squallken> yeah but I wanted to hear what the riffies had to say
<thelonepony> Damn man, well i hope you get better :(
<AlienWarhead> SpadeMagnes[R]: He was in the movie based video games
<CriticKitten> And crying like a little bitch
<naturesfury> god plz kill some1 amen!
<Buytoast> so was the Vulture
<AlienWarhead> A superppower
<oni_link|sick> thelonepony: lol me too, especially since I have work tomorrow
<CriticKitten> Christianity: well known as the religion of revenge
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I was hoping for a movie version of the shocker scene
<DeadpoolDash> also Eddie Brock rarely if ever referred to himself as Junior
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So why does the symbiote hate sound?
<Kurra> I hate how movies turn the already flimsy fake imagery of faith, make it religion, and then just cheapen it further -.-
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] never explained.
<twilight_sprinkle> still, even this movie cant make me hate spiderman
<thelonepony> how do you feel right now oni_link|sick ?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Vibrations maybe?
<Spectrum_Rush> SpadeMagnes[R]: space is silent
<XaviortheSavior> SpadeMagnes because, that's why
<CriticKitten> SpadeMagnes: Didn't we talk about this? Asking silly relevant questions.
<Canadian_Brony> Kurra IKR? Stupidly annoying
<Kurra> Uh, not fake imagery of faith-- I mean how they make faith look fake
<oni_link|sick> I really liked the Amazing Spiderman, this series managed to ruin the Symbiotic Spider-Man and Venom for me :/
<Sebiale> SpadeMagnes[R] Never explained in the movie, but in the comics it has to do with sonic vibrations.
<[Alpha]> Wow it's just....terrible :S
<ASoftFluffyThing> NO, BLACK MATERIAL! YOU MADE ME ACT FOR A CHANGE!
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: iirc from the tv series, the alien is just hurt by the frequency of that sound
<oni_link|sick> thelonepony: not too bad, Ive been nomming cough drops like crazy
<doctor_whooves127> the whole weak to sound thing wasnt really ever explained even in the comics
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Choclaye raaiiiiin
<Canadian_Brony> oh great, now I have Chocolate Rain in my head
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Some stay dry
<ASoftFluffyThing> And others feel the pain
<AlienWarhead> CHOCOLATE RAIN you guys CHOCOLATE RAIN :O
<DeadpoolDash> hey its the stuff from Prometheus
<Petrified_Discord> And then Venom happened.
<Canadian_Brony> GAH
<Marco> Ohai SpadeMagnes[R] (wow im late)
<Petrified_Discord> AH
<CriticKitten> xD
<Canadian_Brony> we were EATEN
<Canadian_Brony> by VENOM
<Buytoast> yes

<Marco> Hai thelonepony and Canadian_Brony :D
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Marco
<CriticKitten> And so, 1:44 into the movie and we have our title villain at last!
<Kurra> Crude oil symbology
<AlienWarhead> hi Marco
<Marco> hey twilight_sprinkle and AlienWarhead
<Marco> So much hilights
<DeadpoolDash> lets see how much Venom refers to himself as "We"
<Canadian_Brony> CriticKitten IKR?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So why did it take almost 2 hours for the title villian to become relavent?
<Sebiale> In the comics Venom also has issues with fire.
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] Emo Parker
<CriticKitten> Because this movie is a failure on every level.
<Kurra> XD
<Canadian_Brony> it's ALWAYS Emo Parker
<Canadian_Brony> CriticKitten that too
<naturesfury> i would of just bought a new door a long time ago....
<oni_link|sick> CriticKitten: eeyup
<Kurra> Honestly, new door at Home Depot, literally like $40.
<oni_link|sick> Canadian_Brony: lmao emo parker XD
<Mega_Milk> naturesfury: He dosent need a door. Just new knobs.
<Kurra> Drill a deadbolt and install for like $20 more.
<AlienWarhead> I proposed, but I sold my marrage to the devil
<DeadpoolDash> all the sybiotes have issues with fire and sonics
<CriticKitten> AlienWarhead: We do not mention One More Day.
<CriticKitten> EVER.
<AlienWarhead> CriticKitten: Sorry, I couldn't help myself because I'm a fan of Linkara
<Sebiale> Guitar Hero reference :D
<oni_link|sick> Well, Ill brb
<Kurra> what's another day?
<naturesfury> *
<naturesfury> ^^
<DerpyMuffins> Cya everypony
<Canadian_Brony> seeya DerpyMuffins
<thelonepony> Bye DerpyMuffins :)
<AlienWarhead> hi DerpyMuffins
<Canadian_Brony> dat pawnch
<Dj_Cyber-4G> bye DerpyMuffins
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Isnt Symbiote supposed to beefy?
<doctor_whooves127> also venom is kind of a freak in that most symbiots kill there hosts
<thelonepony> Ohai AlienWarhead :3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> AND WHERE IS THE EVIL VOICE
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Busy fight scene incoming! Also, Venom.
<DeadpoolDash> venom should always refer to himself as "WE"
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: depends on who the owner is
<AlienWarhead> hi thelonepony
<XylemTube> Hi!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Okay. Thanks, Canadian_Brony. :)
<Petrified_Discord> We ALL wanna kill the Spiderman!
<Canadian_Brony> np
<[Alpha]> HEY it's foreplay
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, XylemTube. :)
<Kurra> Venom's supposed to be beefy as heck.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wasnt symbyote brock beeffy?
<thelonepony> Hi XylemTube :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *beefy
<DeadpoolDash> yes
<twilight_sprinkle> its simple, we Kill the spiderman
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi XylemTube
<XylemTube> andOMG rifftrax! I loveshizu
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And why doesnt he have the creepy voice?
<DeadpoolDash> brock was also beefy before the symbiote
<Sebiale> Kurra Venom is buff because Brock is/was buff.
<Petrified_Discord> Kurra: Instead of beefy they went with beef jerky...y
<AlienWarhead> SpadeMagnes[R]: Yeah I don't know why they changed that
<durger> ha
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ruined forever
<CriticKitten> Kurra: One More Day is an insultingly bad Spiderman comic in which Aunt May is dying, and Peter makes a deal with the devil (literally) trading his marriage with MJ in exchange for Aunt May's life.
<Kurra> They went with turkey jerky it looks like to me....
<doctor_whooves127> venom is buffer than brock by quite a bit
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Busy *annoying Hyperion respawn voice* Between you and us, that thing that killed you is a total dick. Please ignore this message if you commited suicide.
<Kurra> CriticKitten DEAR HEAVENS.
<Shizuka> 13quick, out of nowhere let's have a protracted action sequence
<CriticKitten> Kurra: It's a comic critically panned by everyone and hated by every fan of comics out there because of how fucking insulting it is.
<XylemTube> am i the only one who thought Matrix Reloaded and Revelations is underrated?
<Sebiale> CriticKitten I thought the real issue was the retcon of the marriage.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Wait
<Squallken> oh yes a kidnapping fixes EVERYTHING
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka atleast it's a GOOD fight scene
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> How did this happen?
<Canadian_Brony> best part of the movie, anyway
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Do they ever explain this?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> No kidnapping scene?
<doctor_whooves127> the sand man quick was the hydroman
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> No nothing?
<VenHur> CriticKitten: HOLY FRUITY PEBBLES!
<Kurra> I keep expecting to hear Blige eerytime someone says Mary Jane
<Mega_Milk> Wow.....she gets kidnapped A LOT. Youd think shed buy a gun or a tazer or some freakin mace by now!
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Busy there was. Venom grabbed Mary Jane's face after she got in a taxi. That's about it . . .
<CriticKitten> Sebiale: Yup. He trades his marriage for Aunt May's life, and the author admits he did that because he liked the original stories better, back when he was not married, thus retconning his entire development over decades.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Canadian_Brony: Ah. Okay.
<XaviortheSavior> AJIsAwesome You must have missed the very brief scene where Venom grabbed MJ in a taxi.
<Petrified_Discord> Mega_Milk: She's been diagnosed with Princess Peach syndrome
<CriticKitten> Which is why it pissed so many people off.
<Canadian_Brony> it's not very impressive
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> XaviortheSavior: I must've. Okay.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> LOL SOME PIG!
<DeadpoolDash> when did this become charlotte's web
<Maid_RainBow> well everypony i have to go
<Maid_RainBow> bye bye
<Shizuka> 13suddenly he's gouda!
<thelonepony> Bye Maid_RainBow :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Bye, Maid_RainBow. :)
<Canadian_Brony> dat face
<AlienWarhead> bye Maid_RainBow
<Canadian_Brony> seeya Maid_RainBow
<Shizuka> 13quick! find me the top secret public security team!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> HOW IS HE NOT DEAD
<doctor_whooves127> get help from enemy over ironman or the fantastic four
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka oh, I have them on speed-dial.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> HE WAS IN THE CENTER OF A EXPLOSION
<Sebiale> CriticKitten: >.> The problem with the major comic continuities has been the author's inability to really progress the characters and the stories. :S
<Canadian_Brony> 1-800-FUCK-YOU
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> In this segment the Buddha doesn't deserve his help
<CriticKitten> Because he's magic. :D
<Sebiale> authors'*
<CriticKitten> ....and now this fucking guy
<XaviortheSavior> And the butler decides to stop being an idiot
<sub06905|BF3> almost Alfred
<naturesfury> and your just now telling him this?
<AlienWarhead> Why the hell didn't say that earlier, you're fired
<CriticKitten> YOU ARE FIRED
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Alfred ripoff?
<Shizuka> 13and then for no particular reason the butler picks NOW to tell him
<Kurra> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8127/ this whole entire universe of Spiderman.
<doctor_whooves127> ha ha burnerd is kind of a dick waited 2 years to tell him this
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WHY DIDHE NOT EXPLAIN THIS WAY EALIER
<Petrified_Discord> Worst. Alfred. EVER.
<CriticKitten> Because he's a fucking idiot
<sub06905> :D
<Shizuka> 13you should have told him that TWO MOVIES AGO
<SpadeMagnes[R]> CriticKitten: Can I flip a table?
<thelonepony> Kurra: thats me right now
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka you're late to saying that.
<[Alpha]> who has seen two best sisters play resident evil 4 x3
<Canadian_Brony> But you added stuff too
<Kurra> this is he only good part.
<CriticKitten> Please do. Shit like this is why the film is so terrible.
*SpadeMagnes[R] flips a table in rage how stupid this movie is
*AJIsAwesome|Busy hands SpadeMagnes[R] a table
<Petrified_Discord> Would have been better if he had just figured it out himself.
<DeadpoolDash> I has [Alpha]
<Mega_Milk> butler is best hero.
<doctor_whooves127> burnerd keeper of the polt
<AlienWarhead> [Alpha] Probably 2-3 times
*Canadian_Brony unflips the table SpadeMagnes[R] flipped and flips it himself.
<Canadian_Brony> I love how she should be dead
<Kurra> When a man who you have only treated professionally at best, comes out and says HE LOVES YOU, calmly, that BUCKING MEANS SOMETHING, so you should pay attention.
<Canadian_Brony> but isn't
<[Alpha]> I watched it over and over. Doesn't get old
<CriticKitten> Well gee I guess those webs that are as strong as steel can't hold up a single taxi cab
<Petrified_Discord> Dat flag
<AlienWarhead> AMERICA
<Squallken> and AMERICAN FLAG :P
<CriticKitten> AMERICA
<XaviortheSavior> MERICA
<Buytoast> MURIKA
<AlienWarhead> In Canada
<Spectrum_Rush> 'murrica
<Canadian_Brony> :D
<Mega_Milk> quicksomeone start the slow clap!
<Dj_Cyber-4G> UHMURIKA
<Sebiale> MJ should be dead! I don't care that she didn't hit the ground, the abrupt change in velocity after falling that far should have done serious damage.
<thelonepony> :D
<AlienWarhead> Carage
<Petrified_Discord> lol Red Suit Venom
<CriticKitten> It's a trap!
<Petrified_Discord> It's a tarp!
<CriticKitten> Stop removing your mask!
<[Alpha]> his teeth...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It's a part!
<Canadian_Brony> My god. Eddie.
<AlienWarhead> Carnage :P
<XylemTube> OH MAI
<Sebiale> Petrified_Discord: Y we talking about Carnage?
<CriticKitten> You have no reason to keep taking your damn mask off!
<thelonepony> Admiral CriticKitten, knows when shit is a trap
<Canadian_Brony> dat lack of emotion
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> IfyouknowwhatImean.jpg
<VenHur> So Shizuka, do you prefer any of the three movies, or The Amzing Spiderman movie better?
<VenHur> *amazing Spiderman
<Shizuka> 13haven't seen the new reboot
<Shizuka> 13of these three the first is best
<Petrified_Discord> Sebiale: Carnage always made me think of Deadpool + symbiote
<Squallken> I NEED TO SEE THAT REBOOT
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<CriticKitten> Amazing Spiderman is pretty crap too.
<DeadpoolDash> at least the new spider-man has web shooters
<XaviortheSavior> Shizuka give it a watch
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka WATCH IT. The Amazing Spider man is GOOD.
<Kurra> Of all these movies, Star Trek IV is the best.
<Shizuka> 13i haven't heard anything good about the new one .-.
<CriticKitten> But it's better than this one.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ah.
<Shizuka> 13it was only made so they don't lose the license
<CriticKitten> Not saying much.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Okay.
<CriticKitten> But it is better than this one.
<[Alpha]> just saying hes hould be dead
<VenHur> Shizuka: Haven't seen it either, But I think I heard it's good.
<Sebiale> Petrified_Discord: Oh sweet Celestia. That would be horrifying.
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: moo
<DeadpoolDash> the lizard was done wrong
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Plot conveinience?
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka here's a good thing about it: the love interest isn't a damsel in distress.
<CriticKitten> That was a lot of green screen
<XaviortheSavior> should be ded
<Shizuka> 13yeah but it's a comic book
<Petrified_Discord> Oh look he landed in SAAAAAND
<Canadian_Brony> and then he broke every bone in his body
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: imo its better than 2 and 3 of this and hell i liked it better than the first one also
<flutterchu> i thought venom wasnt a villan (people at school told me) :'(
<Shizuka> 13you can't have deep characters
<DeadpoolDash> venom's character traits change over the years
<Canadian_Brony> oh look, CG
<Kurra> Boss battle!
<Canadian_Brony> :D
<CriticKitten> Well gee, it's a good thing those webs are strong enough to hold steel....oh wait never mind, this film keeps forgetting that factoid
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Fight!
<Petrified_Discord> Sebiale: Oh god...symbiote Deadpool ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
<DeadpoolDash> the current venom is Flash Thompson
<Kurra> wat.
<Canadian_Brony> You got eyes in my sand!
<Sebiale> Petrified_Discord: Like in a what-if, or part of the old main continuity?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> You got sand in my potato salad!
<DeadpoolDash> Eddie Brock is Anti-Venom
<Kurra> Symbiote Deadpool is so ridiculous, I bet he's just a librarian or something
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Were any of the Venoms "good" in any sense?
<Canadian_Brony> and dead
<Canadian_Brony> dead
<Shizuka> 13oh look, a new thing to fall on her
<CriticKitten> For god's sake, we get it, writer. You like the Mummy. A lot.
<Sebiale> Was that supposed to be a laugh?
<VenHur> Deadpool, the normal universe one, is FREAKING. AWESOME.
<Canadian_Brony> DEAD
<Petrified_Discord> Sebiale: So I have no idea what this is from, but yeah: http://derpy.me/uCGCH
<Canadian_Brony> HE DIED DAMMIT!!!
<[Alpha]> Spiderman needs a sword or something
<CriticKitten> ....derp eyes?
<VenHur> We need more fourth wall breaking super heroes like him...
<CriticKitten> ded
<oni_link|AFK> Shizuka: I honestly like the re boot, this trilogy on the other hand... I also think they did it to eventually include him in the Avengers, they still need Wolverine as well >.>
<XaviortheSavior> deaf
<SpadeMagnes[R]> TOOK LONG ENOUGH
<Spectrum_Rush> Petrified_Discord: simple deadpool being taken over by the carnage symbiote
<J_E_Smith71> Hey its Clayface! Oh wait no
<naturesfury> gnarly!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Timing!
<Petrified_Discord> Spectrum_Rush: You know, the usual :P
<Canadian_Brony> The kid gives more emotion in that one line than Peter in the entire series!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<VenHur> ^^
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> He came.
<thelonepony> ^^^^
<CriticKitten> LOL
<SpadeMagnes[R]> TEAMWORK

<Canadian_Brony> It's so bad.
<XaviortheSavior> 2v2 Fightf!
<Mega_Milk> no choppers, no police snipers, no army, basically any random guy with a gun could take over new york.
<oni_link|AFK> Canadian_Brony: literally
<CriticKitten> That is exactly how jets work
<Kurra> YEAH
<Canadian_Brony> oni_link|AFK well duh, I've used it before.
<Kurra> Mini-crits all around!

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Damn kid
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Dat acting
<Canadian_Brony> that kid is a freaking genius
<CriticKitten> LOL

<oni_link|sick> Canadian_Brony: lol

<Kurra> Like a motherbukken' CEO
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> And he comes the screaming.........AGAIN.
<Canadian_Brony> XD
<CriticKitten> MJ, do you have any purpose beyond falling and screaming?
<XaviortheSavior> ifyouknowwhatimean.jpg
<CriticKitten> Just....ya know, asking.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And she didnt die...
<Canadian_Brony> and their necks snapped
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: sleepies
<SpadeMagnes[R]> FUCK PHYSICS
<Kurra> AGAIN 50Gs of acceleration.
<oni_link|sick> Who does he think he is defying physics like that, Pinkie Pie??
<Megalomanic> So...what happened to Venom?
<Sebiale> SpadeMagnes[R]: No kidding.
<Canadian_Brony> only 60's Spiderman does what he wants
<Shizuka> 13MJ..
<Shizuka> 13buy a gun..
<oni_link|sick> Megalomanic: he took a smoke break, hes not needed on the set yet
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka but that would require her to think.
<XaviortheSavior> good thing about the reboot movie: gwen stacy actually knows how to defend herself
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hey MJ, how about you oh I don't know, FIND SOMEPLACE SAFE?!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So why does this area have so much sand?
<Kurra> MJ.... move to freaking St. Kitts and Nevis. Retire. You deserve it.
<oni_link|sick> Canadian_Brony: that too
<Canadian_Brony> XaviortheSavior EXACTLY!!!!
<CriticKitten> xD
<Sebiale> lol
<Canadian_Brony> facelift
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I can't help but laugh at Peter's torn mask :D
<XaviortheSavior> bonk
<Petrified_Discord> 3-hit combo
<Canadian_Brony> that was timed so perfectly
<oni_link|sick> I havent been following the Spider-Man comic universe, how did Peter die??
<JRP> Give NewSuperBronyU hugs
<CriticKitten> STOP THAT
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It looka like a terrible fashion trend. :D
<CriticKitten> Stop taking your mask off for no goddamn reason
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Busy there are a lot of terrible fashion trends
<CriticKitten> Eddie's stupid face <<<<<<<<< Venom's face
<CriticKitten> Amnesia XD
<AlienWarhead> oni_link|sick: I think he only stayed dead in the ultimate universe
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So does Venom's species have a name?
<Sebiale> Do they actually make these jokes as they watch the movie? Or do they just edit all of this in?
<Canadian_Brony> well, he just broke every bone in his body
<oni_link|sick> AlienWarhead: Oh well theres a new one isnt there?
<Canadian_Brony> or atleast his neck
<SpadeMagnes[R]> FATALITY
<Shizuka> 13Sebiale: they do some preparation, otherwise they're recording while they watch
<CriticKitten> Well hey, we didn't need that extra main character anyways, right?
<Kurra> Okay, that part is meaningful.
<Canadian_Brony> and then Harry died
<Canadian_Brony> NEXT
<AlienWarhead> oni_link|sick: Yeah, but I don't know much about it
<CriticKitten> YOU HAVE WEB SHOOTERS

<J_E_Smith71> He threw a Samus Aran bomb at it

<DeadpoolDash> venom is one of the most resilent characters in the marvel universe
<Canadian_Brony> >mangles metal rods

<Canadian_Brony> >concrete is unaffected
<oni_link|sick> CriticKitten: and in one section of a single movie
<Shizuka> 13i thought goblin was his arch enemy
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He's like Ridley
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He gets better
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: it varies through the ages
<EctologistPony> Hello :)

<Canadian_Brony> The earth's axis is on a wobble. That's why the North Star changes. One whole "rotation" is called a Celestial Year. Currently, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted in a way that gives us more extreme Summers and Winters, and the Southern Hemisphere will have milder Summers and Winters.

<Sebiale> Kencolt: Not even those--IntenseDebate, Wordpress, OpenID, all of those fail as well.
<Kencolt> And by a couple -seven I mean two sets of seven. Doubles.
<Kimori> So....Stormy, what are your plans after graduation?

<Phase4> i've never gotten a c because australia doesnt grade like that

<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, my school sometimes does that letter grading system :<

*Panda got all F's in highschool....
<twilight_sprinkle> teachers were biased as hell
<Phase4> Saturn, does aspergers count?
<Panda> wait wait wait Saturn Psychology is MY job!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> the teachers in my high school actually gave us lower grades so that we couldnt do worse on the final tests and make it seem as though they were giving us too high grades
<Kencolt> I never went to high school. Truly. I actually lived in the freaking woods for a while (this WAS the 70's) and then too a GED to get into college.
<twilight_sprinkle> so instead they always gave us lower grades so they could say "oh well hedidnt study, but he studied for final"
<Panda> Kencolt O_O how old are you
<Kencolt> 55 come november, Panda .

<Kencolt> NewSuperBronyU: By my counts? EVERYTHING.
<DeadpoolDash> it is the product of the biggest piece of fan fiction ever, the prequels
<twilight_sprinkle> midichlorian is a good idea imo
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I thought Episodes I, II, and III were the better trilogy than IV, V, and VI.

<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, after this one
<DeadpoolDash> sweet, this doesnt have lyrics. I hate the lyrics to this song
<AdamTheDuck> ^ Vocals seem out of place yes, but the lyrics aren't that bad.
<DeadpoolDash> yeah whoever sings it sounds horrible
<AdamTheDuck> First one Phase4 :P
<Phase4> DeadpoolDash, the lyrics aren't too bad
<DeadpoolDash> it is just so grating to listen to
<DeadpoolDash> it ruins the the decent music that is in the background
<Phase4> "The filename does not have to exist in the local filesystem." Wat
<Phase4> is stream lagging?
<AdamTheDuck> Stream just stopped
<Phase4> Damn
<AdamTheDuck> and my ship is getting blown up to pieces ;~;
*AdamTheDuck flips table
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, your ship explode?
<AdamTheDuck> Not really my ship, Captain chose the Squid ship in a duelling game mode ;~;
<Phase4> XD
<Moopy> well i better go to bed everypony see yall in the morning
<AdamTheDuck> Ship explodes even before I get a chance to repair the hull
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Moopy
<DeadpoolDash> steam in stream
<AdamTheDuck> Game looks a lot more polished as well Phase4
<AdamTheDuck> in terms of menu and all
<Phase4> its getting there
<Phase4> tf2 y u update
<Gold_Demona> TF2: Because WE LOVE YOU!!!!
<AdamTheDuck> D:
<AdamTheDuck> Punish quitters?
<Phase4> dat news
<Tiberium126> Evening all
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, read the update
<Phase4> ohai Tiberium126
<Phase4> soo much invite
<Phase4> ohai shana
<Phase4> shana, you know much about apache?
<shana> hey Phase4, depends in which area :)
<Phase4> dat slow loading tf2
<Phase4> shana, php-fpm + apache 2.2
<shana> hmm no particular php-fpm experience, I only use fastcgi php
<DeadpoolDash> lolz Saxton Hale is coming for all the quitters, cowards and wheyfaced weaklings in Mann vs. Machine
<shana> but they may be similar
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Tiberium126
<Phase4> "Invalid command 'Action', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration
<Phase4> "
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<shana> that's the apache error message?
<Phase4> yeah
<shana> did you use 'Action' in the config file?
<Tiberium126> G'day DerpyMuffins
<Phase4> shana, yeah, tbh its copy pasted from the internet
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DerpyMuffins
<shana> Phase4: did you load the fcgi modules?
<Phase4> i'm fairly sure its loaded
<shana> actually how does the action line look?
<AdamTheDuck> Ok, I just read it Phase4, but how doe sit punish leavers? It just says in what circumstances one gets punished.
<AdamTheDuck> does it*
<Phase4> shana, http://pixelgrade.com/web-server-administration/turn-apache-into-a-super-fast-webserver-with-mod_fastcgi-and-php-fpm/ same as this
<Phase4> copied from alias to action
<DerpyMuffins> Saturn stream?
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, reduces queue priority
<AdamTheDuck> Nope Phase stream DerpyMuffins
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins, phase waits for tf2 to load stream
<DeadpoolDash> tf2 can take forever nowadays to load up
<AdamTheDuck> "but how doe sit punish leavers? It just says in what circumstances one gets punished." Oh I missed that
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut
<AdamTheDuck> why didn't it copy?
<AdamTheDuck> "Said punishment means being placed in low-priority matchmaking pools, making it longer to get into a game."
<AdamTheDuck> There
<shana> Phase4: you need mod_actions for that, imho
<shana> Phase4: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_actions.html make sure you have that one loaded
<Phase4> these games will be slow
<Phase4> ah
<Phase4> shana, that looks like the problem
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://cdn.brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/comics/2012-08-27-433-WordPuzzle.jpg
<shana> Phase4: btw why are you using apache in the first place :)
<DeadpoolDash> I wonder if any mann vs. machine mods have been made with the machine ponies
<Phase4> shana, verry bad hack for caching
<shana> Phase4: nginx has nice fastcgi support... (takes a while to convert apaches htaccess sometimes..)
<taoumi> and with that i big everypony a good morning...or night depending on your time zone/ whatever
<taoumi> bid*
<Phase4> shana, i'm proxying through nginx, thing is i need .htaccess suport
<AdamTheDuck> Goodbye taoumi
*AdamTheDuck is stuck on downloading yourface2.mp3 .-.
<shana> Phase4: most htaccess files are rather simple and you can do stuff like rewrite inside nginx
<Phase4> shana, i meen i explicitly need .htaccess files
<Phase4> i've got some php
<Phase4> derp
<shana> Phase4: you have php generating htaccess files?
<Phase4> shana, i've got some php code that needs to generate them
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://cdn.brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/comics/2012-09-28-441-Tails.jpg
<Phase4> shana, i'll give you read access on bitbucket
<shana> sounds like a caching hack :D
<Phase4> shana, its a hack
<Phase4> a dirty filthy hack
<Phase4> but it works
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ooooh nooooo a haaaack
<CrimsonPhoenix> how uncooth
<Phase4> shana, whats your username?
<Phase4> nvm, found it
<Phase4> shana, http://pastebin.com/P6mLUwUw example htaccess file
<adasdad> trixie pyro
<adasdad> lol
<Phase4> i'm dying fast
<Phase4> not sure why
<adasdad> Lyra PAWNCH
<Phase4> need less friendlys
<Phase4> they add health to hale but do nothing
<shana> so you're serving from cache util it expires - in which case you redirect to index.php :D
<adasdad> vs cmc? awesome
<shana> (well its a rewrite)
<Gold_Demona> heh
<MadSurge> Yaaaay Phase4 is a chicken :D
<Phase4> shana, indeed
<Snow> hello ever- :o tf2!
<adasdad> molestia!?!
<Phase4> shana, i'm going to have to change that in the future
<Phase4> different entry points and whatnot
<MadSurge> adasdad: and Kinky Pie :D
<shana> love the ascii art :D (I know its not really ascii..)
<Gold_Demona> dat Brodyquest
<adasdad> lol
<adasdad> dat fitting name
<Snow> dat snipah
<adasdad> dem dats
<AdamTheDuck> Kinkeh Pie is best Pinkie Pie
<Phase4> shana, :3
<Snow> what server is this?
<shana> do you invalidate caches when new posts are made and such?
<AdamTheDuck> Snow, 208.167.245.210:27015
<Phase4> shana, not yet, thats in plugin.php
<Phase4> i'm looking through for the best way to do that
<Phase4> that goomba scared the shit out of me
<shana> I think there are some plugins that do that
<Phase4> shana, i can catch 90% from actions in post.php
<shana> i.e. generate a static html on every post change (instead of on-demand)
<Phase4> Oh
<Phase4> shana, i've looked at that but its probably not worth the effort
<Phase4> a full site generation of bronystate takes a while
<Snow> yes you can explode twice, if you have a cluster grenade that is
<MadSurge> Yaaay, go Phase4! :D
<Snow> still downloading bosses.
<adasdad> so much wub
<MadSurge> Snow: how big are all these downloads? O_o
<Snow> idk
<adasdad> points expunged fro not giving vinyl a bass cannon attack
<Snow> but it needs to download meshes and stuff
<Phase4> MadSurge, Massive
<Phase4> theres a lot to download
<Phase4> 208.167.245.210
<Phase4> need players
<MadSurge> Phase4: Dang, I wish I had more space and a better computer :(
<Snow> im just past applejack, and that was the first thing to download
<Phase4> MadSurge, :(
<AdamTheDuck> Alright, enough TF2 for me :P
<Phase4> night AdamTheDuck
<DeadpoolDash> well that is enough GW2 for me tonight
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Looks like there's a big announcement coming today related to My Little Pony :D
<Snow> :O
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, might actually stay up a little more :3
<AdamTheDuck> NewSuperBronyU, yes, they are about to annouce the cancellationo of Season 3 >_>
<adasdad> urrgh, i have to leave in an hour
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: suuuure LD
<MadSurge> :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> Cancellation?
<Spell-of-Gaming> That would be hilarious.
<AdamTheDuck> brb~
<Spell-of-Gaming> Is anyone streaming?
<DeadpoolDash> phase is
<Kandarihu> NewSuperBronyU, indeed. ANd we're due for the S3 premier date
<Snow> dem props
<Spell-of-Gaming> desu
<Rommulus> Any idea how long till the announcment and how it will be announced
<Spell-of-Gaming> Tomorrow is the announcement
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Taking a shot in the dark, but I'm guessing the premiere will either be this year on November 17th or Next Year January 12.
<DeadpoolDash> it will probably be sometime in the afternoon on the 18th for the announcement
<Spell-of-Gaming> I doubt it's gonna be next year.
<DeadpoolDash> it will premier before the christmas toy rush to boost up sales
<CrimsonPhoenix> My reaction when they'll announce the season 3 premiere date. http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/184/
<Phase4> this is not so fun
<AdamTheDuck> Really CrimsonPhoenix, mine would be more like http://derpy.me/vWjrv

<Gold_Demona> I love any episode that centers around Data. Unless it's one where he gets a love interest... Those are just weird. >.>
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> that was a wierd one
<Gold_Demona> Phase4 There was more than one
<Phase4> i've seen on
<Phase4> one'
<CrimsonPhoenix> DeadpoolDash, I don't think that's safe
<DeadpoolDash> is it safe?
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: why not use mod_php?
<Phase4> Saturn, experimenting
<Saturn> 08,01ah
<Phase4> plus i want php running as a different user
<DeadpoolDash> why not zoidberg?
<Kandarihu> Yeah, that's a good episode.
<CrimsonPhoenix> DeadpoolDash, I'm just saying, those things are obscurring the rear view of the car
<Spell-of-Gaming> So original
<Ponies47> Dat Skype
<DeadpoolDash> that is a tiny area in a truck rear window, especially if you are tall
<Phase4> i've no idea why this is doing this
<Phase4> my brains kinda fading in and out
<Phase4> didnt get much sleep and its late
<AdamTheDuck> What be this sleep you speak of Phase4?
<Snow> sleep? whats that?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Sleep is when a mommy and daddy love each other...

<Ponies47> Moo :3
<Phase4> OH
<Phase4> i know whats wrong
<Snow> :o
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Phase4 brain blast
<Phase4> huh
<Snow> halfway through the download btw
<Phase4> strange
<Phase4> thats not the problem....
<Spell-of-Gaming> Windows XP
<Spell-of-Gaming> Y INSTALL SLOW
<Phase4> dat xp
<Snow> xp should be installed in half an hour at least
<Snow> i know this because i had to instal it 3 times for school
<AdamTheDuck> <3 Streets of New Reno
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't want to upgrade .-.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Downgrade
<Gold_Demona> I've had to install XP several times cuz I was a computer killer as a teenager. :P
<Spell-of-Gaming> I mean
<Phase4> that IS the problem
<Phase4> why is php-fpm broke
<pony_1974> Kill yourself lol
<Mutterguy> i swear I own Steam games i can't play because I have XP
<DeadpoolDash> the internets breaks so you has buy moar internets
<Gold_Demona> I avoided upgrading until my computer died. Windows 7 isn't bad though. Depending on the version you get, it's about as stable as XP.
<Snow> i have windows 7 ultimate edition, and its really good
<Spell-of-Gaming> Windows 7 Starter Version is obviously the worst
<pony_1974> I have XP and i dont give a fuck lol
<Phase4> if you have xp its about time to switch to 7
<Mutterguy> Well I'm happy to upgrade to 7 but I'm figuring It's better if I do a full upgrade
<Phase4> better yet, ubuntu
<Spell-of-Gaming> You can't even custom change the wallpaper, from what I heard
<Gold_Demona> I have the right in the middle Windows 7. I like it
<Mutterguy> ...which needs money
<Snow> before you upgrade, i reccomend to check if your hardware is compatible with 7
<pony_1974> XP with SP2 , who the fuck need a good computer ?
<Saturn> 08,01>.>
<Saturn> 08,01<.<
*Saturn 08,01totally isn't going to run nessus on ariscop.net
<Gold_Demona> pony_1974: I do. I like playing graphics-intensive games
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> Saturn, theres bugger all on there right now
<pony_1974> lol
<Phase4> default wordpress install with broken php
<Snow> like borderlands 2 i guess Gold_demona?
<Gold_Demona> Never played Borderlands
<AdamTheDuck> Borderlands is graphic intensive?
<Snow> yeah
<Gold_Demona> Games like Mass Effect 3.
<Spell-of-Gaming> First World Problem: I'm bad at Touhou but still addicted to it anyway.
<Wrek> 05specially if you sue the boarderlands physic engine thingy
<Snow> Arthur, king of the Brittans
<Wrek> 05for water etc
*Ponies47 Glomps Wrek
*Mutterguy gets the coconuts out

<Mutterguy> COP CLO CLOP CLOP
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh lawd
<Gold_Demona> ANY game that has water effects
<Phase4> not sure what to research
<Gold_Demona> research ALL THE THINGS! :O
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, research everything for science!~
<AdamTheDuck> Lol ninja'd by Gold_Demona
<Phase4> Wrek, whats more important, plasma tech or battle ships?
<Snow> lolled, checking my download and it said: downloading uber-cupcake.
<pony_1974> Research your mother LOL
<Phase4> i'm one level of hyper drive away from battle ship
<Saturn> 08,01-j8 is best flag
<Mutterguy> Phase4 how about going ddown the dark path of exploding star?
<Saturn> 08,01ooo! i have an idea
*Saturn 08,01logs into the compute server and does make -j64
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> Saturn, you know much about apache?
<Saturn> 08,01wow
<Wrek> 05Phase4:there is no point in investign in an army if you cant support it
<Phase4> i has bug
<Saturn> 08,01okay, my compile is running real fast now
<Phase4> Wrek, fair enough
<Wrek> 05when your income supports 1 battleship an hour
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: i know a lot about apache
<Wrek> 05and you can mass them up for defence
<Wrek> 05you can expand your planet
<Phase4> Saturn, php-fpm + apache2, how does
<pony_1974> Kill your father then kill your sister lol
<Spell-of-Gaming> My computer sucks.
<Saturn> 08,01magic?
<Phase4> Wrek, so you're saying dont bother untill i'm getting 45K metal per hour?
<AdamTheDuck> Magnets
<Gold_Demona> I'm out of tea... Must make more!
<Spell-of-Gaming> It can't even run a PSP game fast.
<Snow> magic *snort**snort*
<Spell-of-Gaming> Why
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: normally just apt-get install php-fpm
<Phase4> Saturn, it didnt autoconfig
<Saturn> 08,01hm
<Saturn> 08,01are you using nginx?
<Phase4> thats where my music went
<Phase4> Saturn, apache, i'm proxying through nginx
<Saturn> 08,01what does your error.log say?
<Phase4> Saturn, internet says "Action application/x-httpd-fastphp5 /php5.fcgi", apache responds with "The requested URL /php5.fcgi/index.php was not found on this server."
<Phase4> Saturn, pastebin?
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Saturn> 08,01okay, so it's probably just that you don't have the handler set up right
<Saturn> 08,01pastebin me your httpd.conf
<Phase4> Saturn, http://pastebin.com/wae30U40
<Phase4> its the debian httpd.conf so theres a bunch of /*.conf includes
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: i think you have a .htaccess rule overriding it
<Saturn> 08,01that'd be my first guess
<Phase4> no .htaccess file
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<Phase4> well, there is one but its blank
<Saturn> 08,01every page on your server shows as the default for me
<Saturn> 08,01no 404s or anything
<Phase4> you going to ariscop.net or www.ariscop.net
<Phase4> cause ariscop.net is just the default site right now
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<AdamTheDuck> What song is this Phase4?
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1GJMJbZybQ&feature=autoplay&list=PLEE875E4C0AB1380C&playnext=6
<Phase4> Saturn, dem chrome hits
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh, Ultra-luxe theme
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: where did you put your index.php?
<Phase4> in the document root
<Saturn> 08,01oh wait
<Saturn> 08,01no, that's not it
<Phase4> ok, its definantly not invoking php
*Phase4 <3 strace
<Saturn> 08,01i was about to suggest strace \o/
<Saturn> 08,01are you sure php5.fcgi is in /usr/local/www?
<Saturn> 08,01just seems odd you'd put it there, rather than /usr/www
<Phase4> why is it looking for index.pl
<Phase4> Saturn, there is no /usr/local/www
<Saturn> 08,01ah
<Phase4> the site said it didnt need to exist
<Phase4> it is indeed checking that folder for index.php
<Phase4> [pid 1395] stat("/usr/local/www/fastcgi/php5.fcgi/index.php", 0x7fff7bf28f00) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
<Saturn> 08,01aye, you need to change that to be the same as your docu root
<Saturn> 08,01i think
<Saturn> 08,01either that or it's just ignoring your handler for some reason
<Phase4> i think its just ignoring the handler
<Phase4> i don't see why apache would check for that file before telling php
<Phase4> or maybe it is, who knows
<Saturn> 08,01okay, try changing your fcgi aliases to your docu root
*Ponies47 Looks at clock
<Saturn> 08,01and put your index in php5.fcgi/index.php
*Ponies47 sighs "Gotta go" :<
<Ponies47> Bye guys
<Ponies47> Thanks for the stream Phase4
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ponies47
<Saturn> 08,01i think it'll still read from the request path, and uses what it finds to pass to the fcgi server
<Phase4> later Ponies47
<Saturn> 08,01or at least as an argument
<Wrek> 05servers should either be up in 10 minutes
<Phase4> suddenly it works
<Wrek> 05or an hour and 10 minutes :P
<Ponies47> And now off to school blasting Tombstones music in mah ears :P
<Phase4> Saturn, changing it to my doc root indeed made it work
<Saturn> 08,01woo \o/
<Saturn> 08,01my work here is done; now to go and type up a report
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> have fun
<Ponies47> Laters Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01and you!
*Ponies47 GTFO's
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Saturn

<Gold_Demona> Hiyo DerpDash
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DerpDash
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: are you behind a fancy firewall?
<Phase4> Saturn, no, nginx config is wrong
<Saturn> 08,01hmm, you have a lot of ports filtered
<Phase4> it might be actually
<Phase4> openvz vps
<Saturn> 08,01ah, okay
<Phase4> afaik i'm not behind a firewall though
<Saturn> 08,01some interesting things going on with port 53 too
<Phase4> yeah, theres a dns server running for some reason

<RainbowPie> AdamTheDuck: Dont say that o.o

<Kandarihu> AdamTheDuck, baselessly joking about Season 3 being cancelled, that's not funny.
<Snow> im the engie btw
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<Kandarihu> Besides. If they were planning on doing something tragic like that, they wouldn't be building up fanfare of the event.
*AdamTheDuck just realised he forgot to put in a :$ at the end of the joke to point out he wasn't being seriouos

<sonicdude558> Good night Phase4
<RaveBrony> Mega_Milk: No, once Crate 50 starts dropping. You cant get 40 again :D
*sonicdude558 feels sleepy
<RaveBrony> Mega_Milk: The crate i have, 40, is worth about 13 keys atm :P
<RaveBrony> Im hoping it goes up to 16+ when it stops dropping :D
<Lyra`> oh yeah?
<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: So its just gonna escelate untill either tf2 dies out?

<Mega_Milk> Lyra`: 1% chance of ever seeing one.
<Lyra`> my inventory is almost full
<Mega_Milk> Lyra`: Damn 0.0
<RaveBrony> Mega_Milk: Pretty much, # 30 crate is worth buds now.
<Lyra`> i am awesome

<Lyra`> almost all my weapons are unusual
<Mega_Milk> Lyra`: You madame are lucky
<sonicdude558> I guess a fake Phase4 is now on
<Mega_Milk> Lyra`: I must have you.......
<Lyra`> and i dont use crates babe
<sonicdude558> amirite?
<RaveBrony> I dont like unusuals..... theres no "Blue" effect....
<RaveBrony> :(
<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: Yeah I know that.
*sonicdude558 stretches
<Lyra`> hell, i dont even trade for them, they just show up after games
<Mega_Milk> I fund em in crates randomly.
<Mega_Milk> find*
<Lyra`> also, being a female gamer, people give me awesome shit for free :3
<Mega_Milk> XD
<sonicdude558> Bye guys :)
<Mega_Milk> nice.
<Mega_Milk> sonicdude558: Later.
<Lyra`> you should consider being a female gamer
<Mega_Milk> Ehhh.....
<RaveBrony> I want to buy all that i can with my crate. and then start gambling on crafting and openning boxes :D
<Mega_Milk> nah i like my gender too much.
<Lyra`> i mean, yeah you get dick pics from every fifth guy
<Lyra`> but you learn to ignore them
<RaveBrony> ._e
<Mega_Milk> Yeeeeeaaaaahhhhh......no.
<Lyra`> and guys constantly asking to see your ass
<Mega_Milk> My backpack is almost full again. Im gonna have to get an expander soon.
<Eli> 'sup guys?
<Lyra`> rrawr!~!
<Mega_Milk> Eli: Sup.
<Mega_Milk> Lyra`: You madame are a card.
<RaveBrony> Yeah, i feel bad when women are harassed on the servers :I
<Eli> not much Mega_Milk. wouldn't be here if anything were up :P
<Mega_Milk> Eli: Why's that?
<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: I've yet to come across a server were the admins arent heavily doctoring everything -lol
<Eli> Mega_Milk: well, my friends are all in school. as much as i enjoy Bstate, i still prefer to keep my feet on the ground and in RL
<RaveBrony> Ah :P
<Phase4> RaveBrony, i was on a server once, and there was a guy arguing somewhere along the lines of "I'm a good boyfriedn because i buy my girlfriend tf2 items:
<Phase4> and he was arguing with a girl about how girls interpret that
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Ha
<Eli> Phase4: that's sad
<RaveBrony> LOL
<puffmuffins> hi
<RaveBrony> That is so pathetic :D
<Eli> Phase4: except if that girl was a hardcore gamer, that's just so unromantic...
<Sylandest> morning, everypony
<puffmuffins> what happened
<RaveBrony> Hey puffmuffins
<Phase4> Eli, if the girl was a hardcore gamer i doubt she'd need tf2 items from the store
<Eli> yo Sylandest
<RaveBrony> Hiya Sylandest :)
<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: The worst I came across was a gay couple and they werent arguing but the one that im fairky certain in the conversation kept saying how large his boyfriend is and how he calls him "Coke can"
<Mega_Milk> Sylandest: Sup.
<Sylandest> howdy Eli., RaveBrony, Mega_Milk :)
<Eli> Phase4: yeah, but then the gesture would be sweet
*Sylandest sniffs
<Sylandest> I have teh sniffles
<RaveBrony> Mega_Milk: Oh....lord o_e
<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: Yeah....fun stuff on that there tf2..
<RaveBrony> :D
<Phase4> Eli, his argument was actually 'i buy things for her cause thats what good boyfriends do' and that tf2 items are inconsequentially expencive
<Sylandest> and what did I stumble into exactly?
<Phase4> but that was the only example he had
<Phase4> and he was a bit pushy with it
<Mega_Milk> Phase4: Is it possible to find unusuals just by drops?
<RaveBrony> Phase4: Wow....
<Phase4> Mega_Milk, afaik no
<RaveBrony> No
<Mega_Milk> hmmmm.......
<RaveBrony> Unusuals are unboxing only :D
<Eli> Phase4: i think if you give your girlfriend game items, the relationsship isn't gonna last long. games usually don't last long
<RaveBrony> Thats why i want to gamble soon! /)^3^(\
<Mega_Milk> Lyra` Claims to have never touched a box and have like 15 of them.....

<Mega_Milk> RaveBrony: So you can be thinking about what you might wanna trade for?
<Eli> Mega_Milk: can i add you too?
<RaveBrony> Mega_Milk: Steam name?

<Eli> RaveBrony: i have a strange scout gun, scattergun, force a nature and a rocket launcher
<RaveBrony> But I want a clean one that i will paint white and rename Rarity! :D
<Mega_Milk> -lol
<Mega_Milk> I just had white paint
<RaveBrony> :o
<RaveBrony> Eli: Nice :o
<Mega_Milk> I traded that a pocket purrer and some strange medic stuff for the bot killer
<Eli> Mega_Milk: a strange shortstop would help me tho
<RaveBrony> I only have a strange scottish resistance :D
<Mega_Milk> Ive got about 9 or 10 possibly 11 stranges
<Eli> i would love some strange medic stuff. it's actually my favorite class
<RaveBrony> Dont care much for stranges, becuz i dont get that many kills :D
<RaveBrony> Demoman is my favorite class, but Spy is growing on me :P
<Mega_Milk> Im waiting on another trade for someone who is trading me keys for a strange sandman and pistol
<Marx> So how about that Big News the Hub is supposed to tell us today?
<RaveBrony> O.o

<ASoftFluffyThing> Morning, guys
<Eli> Mega_Milk: you got a strange sandman?
<Dken2021> morning ASFT
<RaveBrony> Mega_Milk: Hes got an X for his pic
<Marx> I have no idea what this big news could be. Many are hoping it's the Season 3 announcement, but it could be something completely different. Like a man with 3 buttocks.
<Mega_Milk> Eli: Ive got a strange sand man, bat, milk, and shortstop
<Eli> Mega_Milk: can't find you either...
<Eli> maybe i could add you during a game. if we both enter the game rave is playing?
<RaveBrony> 1 sec
<RaveBrony> Ill hop on my groups server
<Mega_Milk> Well theres two ways to add someone :3
<Mega_Milk> I added you eli
<RaveBrony> :o
<Eli> Mega_Milk: gotcha
<RaveBrony> :)
<Lyra`> why did i put pizza in the freezer?
<Lyra`> am i an idiot?
<Marx> In other news, everybody doing fine this morning?
<Lyra`> i wanted cold pizza this morning, not frozen pizza :(
<Dken2021> quite well, thanks for asking
<Lyra`> FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS!
<RaveBrony> Im good, Marx, how about yourself?
<Mega_Milk> Marx: Cant complain.
<Marx> I'm doing good myself RaveBrony.
<RaveBrony> Lyra`: What is your steam? I wanna see what unusuals you have :$
<Eli> oh btw i made me a brony skype account yesterday cuz of twi :) if anyone wants to add eli.brony he or she shall do so 6_9
<Kammerjunk> Hm. So I just woke up and realised it's past 3 PM here.
<RaveBrony> :I
<Dken2021> morning Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Y'ello.
<RaveBrony> Dang, if i wake up past 11am, i have a horrible day. How do you people sleep in so late? :D
<Kammerjunk> RaveBrony: Lack of sleep in the first place.
<Dken2021> years of practice
<RaveBrony> lol ^
<RaveBrony> Kammerjunk: Ah :\
<Dken2021> well, more like I can get a good night's sleep in like 6-7 hours
<Mega_Milk> Lyra`: You adorable little pony! With the cold pizza!
<Kammerjunk> I had an all-nighter at a friend's house, then I didn't feel tired, so I stayed up until 3 AM the night after.
<Kammerjunk> I am not a clever man.
<Mega_Milk> Lyra`: Tell me your steam name so I may oggle your items >:3
<Eli> RaveBrony: you wake up before 11am? where does the rave in your name come from? when i used to rave, 11am was when i got home!
<RaveBrony> Eli: I would do that same.... in Florida :'( My name is really meaningless ever since i moved to Upstate NY....
<RaveBrony> No raves, no cons, no parties.... no gatherings...
<Dken2021> have I mentioned that Emolgas are the devil?
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Mega_Milk> the hee is an emolga?
<Mega_Milk> hell*
<RaveBrony> Whats an emolga?
<Dken2021> this littrle bugger http://derpy.me/AZbED
<RaveBrony> O.o
<RaveBrony> Is that a pokemon? :D
<Dken2021> yup
<RaveBrony> Thats badass, haha
<Marx> Emolga. He's a Unova pokemon, a flying squirrel specifically.
<Marx> Because a regular electric squirrel (Pachirisu) wasn't enough.
<RaveBrony> I havent played pokemon since gen 3 :I
<Dken2021> they're really annoying, too fast, most of them have double team, static ability, arg >.<
<Marx> Oh wow. You need to catch up. The new Black 2 and White 2 games are pretty good so far.
<RaveBrony> I wasnt able to continue after r/s/e :D
<Dken2021> and now they have encore, great -_-
<MadSurge> Hahaha Emolgas, the gym leader trolls you with them :D
<RaveBrony> and now i hear theres a trashbag pokemon?
<Marx> Anything with Double Team is annoying.
<Marx> Worse, almost every pokemon can learn that move.
<MadSurge> RaveBrony: yesh, he's awesome :D
<Gold_Demona> I like gen 5 personally
<RaveBrony> Dafuq!? Hahaha
<Gold_Demona> It's the first really good game I've seen since Gold and Silver
<Gold_Demona> Not counting their remakes
<RaveBrony> I cant hate on the other gens becuz I havent even given them a chance :I
<Gold_Demona> Which were superb
<Eli> i think *searches room* yeah there it is. a diamond edition with almost all pokemon legally caught
<Gold_Demona> gen 3 was a'ight.
<Gold_Demona> gen 4 was boring until I started Nuzlocking it
<RaveBrony> I LOVED g/s/c
<Gold_Demona> gen 2 was the best
<Gold_Demona> gen 5 comes a close second imo
<Eli> Gold_Demona: it was
<Dken2021> yea, do like gen V all together, it at least has mastered somewhat of storytelling
<Gold_Demona> Yeah the storytelling is a LOT better in gen 5
<Eli> Gold_Demona: gen 5 is good? i never got myself to try it really
<Gold_Demona> Eli: Gen 5 is very good.
<MadSurge> RaveBrony: http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/trubbish.jpg Trubbish
<Gold_Demona> It does not surpass gen 2, but it is very good
<RaveBrony> MadSurge: Oh god! :D
<Eli> Gold_Demona: i think my little bro has an unused white somewhere around. maybe i should play it...
<MadSurge> RaveBrony: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/9/9c/569_Garbodor.png and its evolution Garbodor :D
<Gold_Demona> Eli: I recommend it. =)
<Socks> Hello
<RaveBrony> MadSurge: O_O

<ASoftFluffyThing> It died right after I said "Morning, guys"
<RaveBrony> Oh hey, ASoftFluffyThing :)
<RaveBrony> Didnt see you there :o
<ASoftFluffyThing> hi RaveBrony
<Barbetos> I like how I am downloading 10 things, and my brain is like "Y u so slow internet!?"
<Barbetos> silly thing
<RaveBrony> Usually chat awakens when a stream is on O_o
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<Barbetos> I poke it with a stick
<Barbetos> that seems to work too
<RaveBrony> Well, ive got class in half an hour anyway :\
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back!!!!!!!
<Barbetos> Its fun to also leave a flaming bag of poo laying around next to it. It stomps it out everytime!
<Dark92Enigma> and i'm doing the survey, done with the A Movie, and the pony episode..............still picking the B movie
<Barbetos> No. The random will never stop.
<Barbetos> Pick CHUD
<RaveBrony> Dark92Enigma: Woah! Thanks for reminding me! :o
<Barbetos> that is what I am trying to get shown
<Dken2021> I've been trying to get Kung Pow to play here ever since I came here
<RaveBrony> Bronystate, Y U In My Spam Folder!?
<MadSurge> ^
<Dark92Enigma> i'm trying to pick a halloween themed movie
<Dark92Enigma> so it can match the NOSTALGIAWEEN month
<Dark92Enigma> *i decided to call this month as NOSTALGIAWEEN
<MadSurge> Well both my movies are horror themed :D
<Dark92Enigma> Well, my A movie is Casper
<Gold_Demona> If you're looking for something old and corny to watch, I recommend "The Pumpkin Who Never Smiled"
<Dark92Enigma> it fits, because it outgrossed it's budget
<Gold_Demona> Casper was a cute movie imo
<Dark92Enigma> Gold_Demona: same here....
<Dark92Enigma> Gold_Demona: what's that movie about?
<RaveBrony> Oh, theres not going to be anything special done for halloween?
<Gold_Demona> Not the best by any means, but it's cute and fun, and I'd definitely watch it with my kids if I had any.
<Cypresswolf> :) Everything's almost set to go - I'm bringing a surprise to galveston with me :)
<Gold_Demona> RaveBrony: lol, Hell if I know.
<RaveBrony> :D
<Dark92Enigma> does the Tenacious D movie count as B movie?
<Wrek> 05that went to shit :P
<RaveBrony> Has that been shown?
<Dark92Enigma> or any B movie the NC reviewed
<Dark92Enigma> RaveBrony: yes
<Cypresswolf> Got to run some last minute things and I'm out for the rest of the week - Cypress can kiss my tailgate!
<Dark92Enigma> RaveBrony: as part of an anniversary special, but not as lottery pick
<RaveBrony> Dark92Enigma: Ah :P
<RaveBrony> HmM? Its in the 'Past Movies" tho
<RaveBrony> Mar-9
<RaveBrony> So its good now :)
<RaveBrony> I dont pick a B movie, becuz theres none i want to see :D
<Dark92Enigma> RaveBrony: either as lottery-picked or anniversary themed
<Wrek> 05now that worked
<Dark92Enigma> What about.....Ernest Scared Stupid?
<Dken2021> I think you have to, iirc or else it won't count as a vote
<RaveBrony> It does count. I won before and only put 'Balto' in :o
<Dken2021> oh, ok then
<MadSurge> I just won one pony episode so far :D
<RaveBrony> Then someone picked the pony ep i wanted :P
<RaveBrony> So, im looking for another A
<Dken2021> I smell a ploy
<ASoftFluffyThing> dat link
<RaveBrony> Well snap :D
<Dken2021> either that or a really rational news, whichever comes first
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'll confirm with Hub's FB and Twitter after link :I
<Dken2021> don't they ever check their sources?
<RaveBrony> Meh
<ASoftFluffyThing> EqD? Check their sources?
<Jerry> hello everyone ^^
*ASoftFluffyThing insert JJJ laughing
<Dken2021> yo Jerry
<ASoftFluffyThing> Helo Jerry
<RaveBrony> Hiya Jerry
<Jerry> everyone exited for Fridaaay Niiight?
<Dken2021> it's gonna be a long friday night from what I heard
<Jerry> why?
<ASoftFluffyThing> It is, Dken2021
<RaveBrony> Yeah
<RaveBrony> Long movie, and 3 pony eps
<Jerry> The longer the better Imo. :D
<Kandarihu> The source on that is Entertainment Weekly.
<Marx> I just saw the post.
<Marx> You guys did too.
<RaveBrony> Mhhm :P
<Kandarihu> Marx, it was autolinked by prince-dari
<Jerry> this is planet side 2 right?
<Kandarihu> !c
<Kandarihu> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<RaveBrony> Aw :D
<RaveBrony> Come on, Tom! Get in the game!
<Kandarihu> Today, the mods will FINALLY update Tom
<RaveBrony> \o/
<Dken2021> is Tom using a source or does someone have to put it in manually?
<RaveBrony> and then my Steam groups when crazy with linking the air date.... Hahaha
<RaveBrony> *went crazy
<Kandarihu> Dken2021, one of the mods has to put it in manually, I think.
<Dken2021> ah, k
<Phase4> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/10/season-3-potential-air-date-yay.html aparently november 10th
<EspyLacopa> Season 3 start confirmed?
<Phase4> EspyLacopa, doesnt seem to be confirmed
<Wrek> 05potential =/= confirmed
<Kandarihu> I just figure that Tom is running as a script on somepony's machine and calculates the time between the current time and a future date (the next episode's airdate)
<Zelka> Hello everypony ♥
<Dken2021> Yo Zelka
<Kandarihu> Zelka, hi there. We're already aware of the EW leak
<RaveBrony> If its Nov 10th, thats great! But if not, then meh. Lol
<Phase4> Kandarihu, close, its actually running as part of the irc service that runs tom. theres a hideous command used to enter new show dates
<Kandarihu> Phase4, I see.
<RaveBrony> Well, i have class, ill bbl :)
<Kandarihu> Hideous as in requiring that the date be converted into something that's not meant for human cognition?
<ASoftFluffyThing> If it's on November 10th, I'ma be pissed
*ASoftFluffyThing has a wedding to attend on that day
<Dken2021> you could always tivo it, or use youtube to catch it later
<ASoftFluffyThing> And since the location of said wedding is about an hour or two away, we'd be on the road early. 6, 7am early
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hmm
<ASoftFluffyThing> If I still have The Hub, I'll set it up to record. Freakin' Dish Network giving us Hub for a few days and then taking it away.

<Wrek> 05MadSurge
<Wrek> 05potential =/= confirmed
<FlutterMEDIC> Need good rebuttals? Here're some http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2833/
<Dark_Horst> huh... so they actually did throw auraxium out the window now
<MadSurge> Wrek: unfortunately
<Dark92Enigma> MADE MY CHOICE
<Dark92Enigma> I've picked a B Movie we have NEVER SEEN yet
<Barb|CabanaBoy> So did I see that right Wrek
<Barb|CabanaBoy> Is the new shotgun at pester level as far as damage?
<Barb|CabanaBoy> I thought I saw a tr cloaker hit you like 5 times with one before you ded
<Dark92Enigma> guess what is it?
<Dark_Horst> btw, here's a few words on the season. it's non-spoilery in my opinion, but that probably depends. anyway, have it http://www.derpyhoovesnews.com/entertainment-weekly-announcing-season-3-premiere-for-november-10/
<Barb|CabanaBoy> !!!!!!
<Barb|CabanaBoy> Time to ask off for work
<Barb|CabanaBoy> shut off my phone
<FlutterMEDIC> two things are going to take up my time in November: AC3 and PONEHS
<Barb|CabanaBoy> and crawl into a hole with a hand held tv.
<Barb|CabanaBoy> NO ONE WILL BOTHER ME THAT DAY
<Dark_Horst> FlutterMEDIC: ac3?
<FlutterMEDIC> Dark_Horst: Assassin's Creed 3
<Dark_Horst> oh that one
<Barb|CabanaBoy> Wrek when in doubt, about any fight, hit the altitude cap.
<Barb|CabanaBoy> in fighters
<Dark_Horst> btw, you guys should read the forum threads by the ps1 veterans
<Dark_Horst> entertaining
<Wrek> 05what they did to sniper scopes is atrocious
<Dark_Horst> also makes you wonder what kinda game ps1 was
<FlutterMEDIC> Squidward? http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/8227/
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: you mean the scope being invisible?
<Barb|CabanaBoy> Dark_Horst for every person that hates it there are probably like 3 or 4 fan bois
<Wrek> 05no i mean this:
<Squallken> Planetside?
<Barb|CabanaBoy> The "border" is gone
<Dark_Horst> well... that looks pretty damn ugly
<Barb|CabanaBoy> But no...
<Dark_Horst> which was what i was going at with invisible sniper scopes^^
<Barb|CabanaBoy> There is no drop tracker on the crosshair
<Barb|CabanaBoy> Not sure if like
<Dark_Horst> the standart scopestill has it
<Barb|CabanaBoy> Wow.
<Dark_Horst> then again, th standart scope is crap
<Barb|CabanaBoy> That escalated quickly
<Wrek> 05that scope im usign cost me 24
<Squallken> k thnx
<Wrek> 05its the x8 one
<Wrek> 05its not the standard
<Barb|CabanaBoy> It looks like it belongs on the VS sniper rifle
<Barb|CabanaBoy> that thing has 0 drop
<Dark92Enigma> ok, the punchline is Waterworld
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: btw, is that stull the NC14?
<Dark_Horst> oh well, got a bus to catch.
<Wrek> 05its the standard bolt driver
<Dark92Enigma> ok brb......and if i don't come back............it means i have a curfew
<Kurra> raa.
<Kurra> a semi-friend may come on later :>
<Kurra> o.o
<Kurra> tank /o.o\
<Gold_Demona> I just happen to glance over and... Is he driving a tank? O_o
<Kurra> jeez honestly? Shoot right over a guy's hair XD
<Kurra> Needs moar panzerfaust
<Kandarihu> Well, I honestly hope the date of the premier is correct. It's the weekend following the end of my pony fast.
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: let's hope :3
<Kandarihu> But I liked how they had the new pony episodes at 1 in the afternoon. It worked really well with EMN.
<Kurra> D:!
<Dken2021> :D
<Kurra> no way, tank round > most anything else that's not 10 meters of icy steel
<Kurra> what happened?
<Wrek> 05so my scope is nerfed
<Wrek> 05my bullet drop is nerfed
<Wrek> 05ffs
<Kandarihu> And my GPU is still unsupported
<Blako> hi all
*Gold_Demona meditates with the rest of the chat
<Kurra> I wanna play this game with everything turned off and the resolution at 800x600 :)
<Dken2021> Kurra ....interesting
<Kurra> I am trailing edge. I play games on hardware that is a joke, because nothing brings happy returns like rubbing it in the face of hardware comsumerism... maybe <_<;
<Kurra> well, that is a joke 6 years later
<Kurra> I'm going to get a 360 in 2020 :D
<Gold_Demona> lol Kurra
<Kurra> What?
<Gold_Demona> All that you said
<Kurra> I didn't get a PS2 until uh... like 2007 I think
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, I'm usually late to the part in that regard as well.
<Gold_Demona> perty*
<Gold_Demona> party*
<Ryunosuke> hmm
*Kurra wants to be the latest evar
<Gold_Demona> dat typing fail
<Ryunosuke> so apparently D3 premiers on the 10th at 10am
<Ryunosuke> S3
<Kurra> D:
<Gold_Demona> Is that 10am EST?
<Wrek> 05potential =/= confirmed
<Ryunosuke> i think?
<Kurra> Hey look, a Chevy Suburban :)
<Gold_Demona> Is there any OFFICIAL word on this?
<Wrek> 05nope
<Gold_Demona> I didn't think so
<Wrek> 05hence
<Wrek> 05potential =/= confirmed
<Gold_Demona> Right
<Kurra> okay okay look.
<Ryunosuke> i am looking for it
<Dken2021> this might mean EqD might retract their post if they can't get a legitamite source on it then
<Hanako> >caring about eqd
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<Dken2021> yo Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Ryunosuke> and ya, i read it off EW first :p
*pony_37 BladedWings
<pony_37> crap -_(\
*BladedWings yawn "Morning Bronystate" :)
<Kurra> There's gonna be new pony by April 2014. There just is. So you're getting it then. I confirm it myself.
<Kurra> :D Exaggeration upside the head!
<Kurra> ...this game is shiny *covets*
<ASoftFluffyThing> Morning BladedWings
<Lil_B> aww, done with Harvey's new Eyes, damn this Ending -.-
<Eli> hey Lil_B. what's Harvey's new eyes?
<Lil_B> Eli do you know the game Edna bricht aus?
*BladedWings hugs ASoftFluffyThing :)
<Eli> nope. i think i have heard of a book with that name though. strange family something
<Lil_B> Eli no I guess it has nothing toi do with it, anyway, Harvey's new Eyes is the Sequel to this game
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Ryunosuke> i think it is safe to say that it can be confirmed
<Lil_B> and it has quite the twisted ending (well, 3 endings)
<Ryunosuke> Amy Keating Rogers and Meghan McCarthy both cited the same article through twitter
<Lil_B> Ryunosuke confirm what?
<Ryunosuke> earlier ... news :)
<MadSurge> Lil_B: November 10 :$
<Lil_B> well... still nobody told me about which Topic this is all about, but from the current information I gather that it's about the S3 Airing Date
<Maid_Rainbow> so 10 november is season 3?
<Dken2021> possibly
<MadSurge> Yesh Maid_Rainbow and Lil_B :D
<Dken2021> since it seems like it's the only source saying it is
<Kinixys> Plenty of time to make sure I'm free that day.
<Lil_B> I think I have a new fav Songs for the next 2 weeks
<Alchemist> only 3 weeks to go? I was able to avoid all spoilers so far (havent heard the song, no pictures/clips either), I hope I can keep it this way :D
<Ryunosuke> same here
<Lil_B> I have seen pictures at my little brony, but no clips, and I heard one song, but that one literely Ninjad me >.<
<Keir> havent heard or seen anything myself either.
<Wrek> 05meh
<Wrek> 05time to nap
<Maid_Rainbow> i hear the china theme song of Generals
<Vordox> Wrek: But it's 5 PM. :P
<Kurra> Hell. :(
<Wrek> 05they have quite a few bugs to sort
<Maid_Rainbow> i have to go everypony
<Maid_Rainbow> bye bye
<Lil_B> bye maid ... admnit
<Lil_B> damnit*
<Lil_B> It was while driving to GalaCon, the Driver had a CD with MLP Songs, and halfway through the middle of a song I havev't ever heard "This sounds almost like it's from the show", he replyed "yes, it's a Song from Season 3" . I yelled at him to switch the song immidietly
<MadSurge> Lil_B: DUDE, SPOILERS :D
<Dken2021> hehe
<Lil_B> This postb didn't included any spoilers
<Lil_B> other than "yes, S3 has Songs"...
<BladedWings> if it does come out on November 10 then that would be the best birthday present for me lol
<Ryunosuke> nice :)

<Ryunosuke> hey Moopy
<Keir> Gold_Demona: Lies! S3 contains only rocks
<Moopy> hey

<Gold_Demona> Keir: Rock ponies? O.o
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: :O
<Keir> Gold_Demona: Nope just Tom Dan everywhere for hours on end doing nothing but being cool.
<Gold_Demona> Keir: And Rocky
<Moopy> hey is there a stream going on cause i have to refresh the stream here
<Kandarihu> Speaking of rocks, would I be right in guessing that Tom will only be updated when the "possible" premier time is set in stone?
<Gold_Demona> Hangin' out with Bloonberg
<Gold_Demona> Bloomberg*
<Dken2021> I guess so Kandarihu
<Kandarihu> BladedWings, is November 10th your birthday?
<MadSurge> Keir: I thought it was a mayonnaise jar :D
<Colt_Brovakiin> Good afternoon everyone :)

<Kandarihu> BladedWings, cool. That premier date works for me too.
<BladedWings> Kandarihu: that your birthday too?
<BladedWings> i see no stream so here, have this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k24VUqjcYpI
<Kandarihu> BladedWings, no. Out of profound concern for the future of America, I'm going on a pony fast. The premier is going to be less than a week after my fast is scheduled to end.
<BladedWings> Kandarihu: wow
<Cranberry_Scotch> Apparently there's going to be an episode centered around bullying in season 3.
<Cranberry_Scotch> Mainly how to deal with it and the cause of it
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Cranberry_Scotch: if so then i hope it takes Daimond Tiara down a few notches :D
<Cranberry_Scotch> Also, it seems this season will focus on Twilight's studies
<Kandarihu> I've heard that there's going to be an episode focusing on *SPOILER*
<Kandarihu> So I guess this is going to settle whether *SPOILER* is going to be able to *SPOILER* or *SPOILER*
<BladedWings> :D
<Cranberry_Scotch> And a certain fan-favorite villain will be returning in an awesome way
<Kandarihu> Yes. We all know about *SPOILER* coming back to do voice work
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ I'm ahead of schedule and I got my whiskey And Chick Fil A AND Their Peach Milkshake - Somepony take my phone and hangup on anyone that calls

<Dken2021> I think since you were talking about it, everyone else went out and went to buy some I guess
<Rave|Class> Talk of Chick-Fil-A?
<Kandarihu> It would take a long busride to get to my nearest Chik Fil A
<Rave|Class> Im ok with this <3

<Saturn> 08,01but over the next week or so, one of us will probably come up with some ingenious optimisation
<Saturn> 08,01or a few
<Invi> what was the highest peak during new episodes last year?=
<Chrysalis> Grabbing now then to play tonight
<kimplix> i'm off from college on november 10 so i'll wake up early to watch it
<Chrysalis> Saturn and everything will break
<Saturn> 08,01i think it was about 7,000
<Saturn> 08,01might have been more
<kimplix> like 8:00 am
<RaveBrony> Damn
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: don't say that!
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis Check the patch notes. Some pretty major stuff is now changed
<Chrysalis> Saturn i just spent the last 2 weeks optimising a system
<Chrysalis> got run time from 3:20 to 0:17
<Chrysalis> they said remove this
<Chrysalis> it god damn breaks
<Chrysalis> btw, thats hh:mm
<Invi> i hope i can make it
<RaveBrony> Ill be watching it on my tv anyway. So im not worried if the stream goes down :D
<GilDash> Chrysalis: What on earth was that system doing?
<Chrysalis> im not allowed to say
<RaveBrony> But if i cant chat, they itll be less fun
<Invi> RaveBrony, my TV has no hub :<
<RaveBrony> Invi: Nuuu D:
<Invi> RaveBrony, get an external chatclient ^^
<RaveBrony> Meh, i like this one D:
<RaveBrony> and...i dont know what those are really, haha.
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Not even generally?
<Ryunosuke> whats the spoiler rule for new episodes again? one week post air date?
<RaveBrony> This is my first internet chat thingy
<Invi> then use the ponychat.net mirc (same thing without a stream and bigger window)
<GilDash> Ryunosuke: NEVER! You may never spoil, ever!
<Ryunosuke> well episode discussion not spoiler
<RaveBrony> I thot it was you wait 1 day after the ep
<RaveBrony> Then you can talk about it
<Dken2021> Ryunosuke I think it was 48 hours or something
<Chrysalis> GilDash 'fraid not
<Chrysalis> NDA
<RaveBrony> Couldve been 48 hours, im not sure
<Ryunosuke> hence why I asked NOW instead of 3 weeks from now :)
<Saturn> 08,01NDAs suck
<GilDash> Chrysalis: At least you've got the brain to keep your mouth shut then. :)
<GilDash> Saturn: I concur.
<killerpony7733> Ryunosuke Seen the 2800 MB patch for PS2 today?
<GilDash> Necessary though, sometimes.
<Ryunosuke> killerpony7733, I have not
<Ryunosuke> patch notes?

<Chrysalis> Saturn oh god, why you sharing buck photos
<GilDash> Saturn: That's a good point. WHy *are* you sharing BUCK photos?
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: because that's what one generally does with photos
<killerpony7733> Ryunosuke Main change certs are now used to buy guns and all. And they come by every 250 xp
<GilDash> Saturn: Hence why I don't like being in them. XD
<Saturn> 08,01except the photos i took of Wrek while he slept
<Ryunosuke> weapons are now purchanced on certs rather than market, does it still use auraxium or cert points now?
<soulero> hello? anyone?
<Chrysalis> Saturn that causes events like i had to deal with at my friends wedding
<Saturn> 08,01those are private photos
<Chrysalis> "so you were on a pony panel" etc etc
<killerpony7733> Ryunosuke I think so. But not sure how it works. We'll see
<Saturn> 08,01soulero: hello! w read you, are you receiving? over
<Gold_Demona> hello soulero

<Wrek> 05Sumica: oh! and they removed my dalton
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: oh yeah, continuing my question from earlier: where'd you get the scope for the bolt driver? bolt driver sint listed in the infiltrator's cert menu for me
<Sumica> 00,10cause you have to unlock it
<Barb|CabanaBoy> Can we watch the episode that shows how pixels are made?

<Barb|CabanaBoy> Huh?
<Barb|CabanaBoy> No. Not the dalton

<Dken2021> and for some reason guy had spaghetti in his pockets
<RaveBrony> You know... i have 9 assignments due today.. and yet im watching how pasta is made :D
<SafariMonkey> ha just saw the "Yo Brony!" on Hasbro's MLP page. :D
<Dark_Horst> from that day on, having spaghetti falling out of your pockets is a synonym foor awkwardness
<RaveBrony> Woah
<MadSurge> Mmmm pasta! :Q
<ASoftFluffyThing> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<RaveBrony> So much Tom abuse :D
<XAX> Sumica: The amount of spaghetti that is said to be flowing in a story is how embarrassed the protagonist feels.
<MadSurge> ASoftFluffyThing: we need to update Tom!
<Chrysalis_> anyone else suddenly hungry for pasta?
<SafariMonkey> Tom needs updating?
<ASoftFluffyThing> MadSurge, yes we does
<ASoftFluffyThing> SafariMonkey, yep

<Chrysalis_> Serenity mines cooking ;)
<SafariMonkey> ASoftFluffyThing: I typed that before you all said that. :P
<Applejack2012> 10.11.2012 a day to remember
<XAX> Sumica: For example, "it's fallout spaghestria in here" would mean embarrassment beyond comprehension ._.
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: yep ttp://www.derpyhoovesnews.com/entertainment-weekly-announcing-season-3-premiere-for-november-10/

<Dark_Horst> i think he means 10th of november
<alexxm> ah ok
<Dark_Horst> you know, dd/mm/yy
<Sumica> 00,10that's why I use the month name tather then number when I shorthand it
<Kandarihu> I prefer to think of it as 12/11/10
<Sumica> 00,10that way no one is confused
<Polydunami> Wait, why would you get braces at a hospital? I thought they would've been sold at a clothing shop :S
<Polydunami> :3
<Tovler> I prefer 21/1/12
<MadSurge> Sumica: actually that is better.
<Serenity> Polydunami: I'm at Britain
<DaringDerpy> http://i.imgur.com/qbkLG.jpg three weeks, one day and 19 hours to go
<Applejack2012> final countdown
<Polydunami> Yeah, it's strange. We call braces suspenders and suspenders we call garters.
<MadSurge> Serenity: it's a sign, the writers like europeans better :D
<twilight_sprinkle> the final countdown~
<DaringDerpy> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<DaringDerpy> http://ponycountdown.com/
<crazypony> http://i.imgur.com/SnBhR.png does anypony notice that Hasbro got RD's cutie mark wrong -_-
<Kandarihu> There were never any voiced appearances of Mario before Super Mario 64 iirc.
<Dark_Horst> Pony head writer Meghan McCarthy tells EW that season 3 will focus on main pony Twilight Sparkle as she advances in her magical studies: “She’s been in Ponyville for awhile now, and so her journey is going a little bit further,” McCarthy says.
<Applejack2012> then we are really airdate trolled
<Dark_Horst> i smell delicious worldbuilding
<Serenity> Because Britain's there, MadSurge
<Dken2021> crazypony looks like somebody relied on the concept art
<MadSurge> crazypony: that image is made from OOOOOLD vectors.
<Sumica> 00,10and I smell spoilers Dark_Horst
<SafariMonkey> is this official? (stream)
<Serenity> Kandarihu: Mario had some little voice clips in Super mario world for SNES
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: that's a spoiler?
<NewDCD> 09,01Bowser has sure let himself go
<RaveBrony> That name
<MadSurge> NewDCD: Ikr :D
<Kandarihu> Serenity, only baby Mario in SMW2.
<VenHur> Wait a sec, this show was made before Sonic 1...
<Dark_Horst> a hint in which general direction the season will go doesnt look that spoilery to me. oh well
<NewDCD> 09,01dat pun
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02Mario's FUNdamentals was Charles Martinet's first game where he voiced Mario :)
<Applejack2012> theres spoilers flying in the air :D
<VenHur> LUIGI INVENTED THE SPIN DASH
<Serenity> In SMW, he would say "Aegh, mamamia" when he ded
<NewDCD> 09,01and then Mario took a dip and became a bishonen
*DaringDerpy is at peace with the world again. the apocalypse can come.
<Dken2021> SuperBrony: providing fact out of nowhere
<NullRadix> Serenity: you mean SM64?
*NewSuperBronyU noms on Dken2021
<Serenity> No, Super mario world
*Dken2021 is nommed D:
<Tovler> Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World.
<VenHur> NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: You know there's another Mario cartoon, right?
<MadSurge> NewDCD: and Luigi became a woman :D
<NewDCD> 09,01oh lord I smell a diaper fetishism episode

<XAX> NewDCD: why.jpg
<VenHur> NewSuperBronyU: Saturday Supercade.
<NullRadix> I don't recall any voiceover in the original SMW2 or SMW
<DaringDerpy> it's a good thing, Dark_Horst. season 2 lacked twilight sparkle episodes.
<Dken2021> ....whis is he wearing that diaper?
<Polydunami> So this is before Rugrats?

<NewDCD> 09,01>toddlers will do your chores
<alexxm> why get children to do it
<NewDCD> 09,01CHORES DO NOT WORK THAT WAY
<Dark_Horst> i'm kinda hoping for more coninuity between episodes
<DaringDerpy> someone had states there will be none
<Dark_Horst> that slice of life style they had so far was nice, but i wouldnt mnd story arcs at this point
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: in this show? Nope
<DaringDerpy> -s +d
<RaveBrony> Mary-o's?
<NewDCD> 09,01I'm guessing creating that whole setup took a hundred times more work than just sweeping the fucking floor yourself
<MadSurge> YES
<Sumica> 00,10fast acting stuff.
<Serenity> MMMBABBY
<RaveBrony> damn
<MadSurge> LET HER DROWN
<NewDCD> 09,01DEAR LORD SHE HAS A BOSTON ACCENT AND HUGE FEET

<Serenity> NewDCD: Nothing wrong with that...much
<DaringDerpy> but someone designed a consistent background world. we will not see nonsense like dams and construction sites anymore
<RaveBrony> ded
<NewDCD> 09,01The Mario brothers know nothing about proper parenting
<soulrider95> GUISE new MLP season! I can't for S2!!!! :3

<Serenity> NewDCD: >:U
<Tovler> I'm still waiting for Genndy Tartakovsky to come on board for Season 4.
<RAWRity> soulero: i can guarantee it isn't.
<VenHur> I think this is where Nintendo got the idea for Baby Peach...
<NewDCD> 09,01Spider-Peach
<NewDCD> 09,01Spider-Peach

<Bronysith> I can now actually like shinji
<Dark_Horst> its a movie?
<Bronysith> he ascended to godhood, motherfucker
<MadSurge> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUN

<Lil_B> not upset...
<Lil_B> whats the word I want...
<Lil_B> opsessed is what I ment : D
<twilight_sprinkle> i still dislike shinji, whining while asuka got torn to shreds, and then almost destroying the world just because of his girlfriend
<alexxm> traiter
<sonicdude558> Back! :)
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai sonicdude558
<Colt_Brovakiin> Welcome back sonicdude558
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle I hate asuka because Shinjis mental state was getting better by the day, untiul, Asuka came and set him back
<soulero> smirnoth?
<RaveBrony> wut
<RaveBrony> dat post
<turtlegod98> this movie?
<Lil_B> ... Castlevania? you got me interrested
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: still, he shouldnt have sat crying on his ass while her guts were being torn out
<Saturn> 08,01wait
<Saturn> 08,01what the fuck are you guys watching?
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: gundam 00
<MadSurge> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: we're talking about a different anime though
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle I think thats a Stituation you have to be ypourself to understand it
<Chrysalis> Saturn gangnam
<Kencolt> Saturn: You can't recognise the show by now?
<sonicdude558> inb4 oopa gundam style
*twilight_sprinkle throws Chrysalis into a bonfire
<Saturn> 08,01i can play gangnam style on the piano
<Bronysith> Saturn: do it
<RAWRity> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/17/FnQM9jpCikKOM4PyN1AzuA2.gif
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: nothing justifies letting someone die just because you feel like crying
<Bronysith> Shinji is a great character
<twilight_sprinkle> shinji is a moron
<sonicdude558> mormon
<sonicdude558> :)
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: you are thinking of End of Evangelion anyways
<sonicdude558> TAUMATONS
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle I think I have to see the scene again, to see how exactly he was behaving there :/
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: ive only seen the movies
<soulero> ololool death
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yea, End of Evangelion
<MadSurge> Oh no, automatons!
<RAWRity> Shinji is a great character in CONCEPT. In execution? he's an annoying little twit who constantly frustrates the audience.
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: and again, destroying the world to save his girlfriend is dumb
<MadSurge> ^
<turtlegod98> i'm a turtle.
<Bronysith> still better than tidus RAWRity
<MadSurge> BEST EXCUSE EVER
<RAWRity> Bronysith: that's like being more fragrant than septic tanks
<twilight_sprinkle> well yeah, as a character in terms of quality, shinji isnt bad, but i dont like his character
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle yeah :/
<Bronysith> Simon the digger is better character
<Bronysith> and so is Kamina
<turtlegod98> oh god.
<Chrysalis> double bazoooooooooooooka#]
<Lil_B> DOUBLE?! AND Burst mode????!!!!
<Dark_Horst> that's a definition of boomage
<twilight_sprinkle> lelouche/schneizel/pain(nagato) are excellent characters too
<Bronysith> Kamina is a wonderful lovable character
<turtlegod98> Double bazooka all the way! So intense!
<Kencolt> Bronysith: Simon had support... Shinji never did. Shinji is a study in the emotionally scarred, rejected and manipulated by his father- and damn near anyone else to boot. It's no wonder he was so wonderfully bucked up.
<turtlegod98> What does it mean?!
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, shinji was greatly manipulated by his father
<Bronysith> Kencolt: exactly
<Sumica> 00,10way to go saji, you done fucked up
<Bronysith> Sumica: ONI CHAN
<soulero> welleverypony ima go now
<soulero> bye
<sonicdude558> THIS CANNOT B
<Chrysalis> oniiiiiiichan
<Sumica> 00,10later soulero

<Bronysith> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350582105194.jpg
<turtlegod98> people R ded... Aint that a bitch.
<Kencolt> Bronysith: So... I can't hate Shinji. Necause he really had no choice-- he was never really given one. Simon WAS given a choice-- and became freakishly awesome.
<twilight_sprinkle> is the evil spanish guy dead?
<sonicdude558> dat shadow
<Bronysith> Kencolt: i dont hate shinji,
<Sumica> 00,10old one Bronysith
<Bronysith> Kencolt: simon is just the better character cause he got over it
*Bronysith licks Sumica s shins
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont hate shinji either, i still dislike him though
<MadSurge> Bronysith: Switched bodies with Rarity ._.
<RaveBrony> Started a gang with Derpy.... hahaha
<Lil_B> I really hate Animes with this way too heavy imigery alla "LOOK! it MEANS something :O"
<[Alpha]> ...
<Kencolt> Bronysith: Because he had the opportunity. Shinji is a tragic character. (He was also part of whatever the hell goes through Anno's head.)
<Lil_B> I gess I just like it wwhjen it's more subtle and realistic
<Sumica> 00,10not madeupisstan
<Lil_B> when*
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: like ghost in the shell?
<twilight_sprinkle> burnistan
<MadSurge> Sumica: Ikr :D
<sonicdude558> OOPA GUNDAM STYLE
<twilight_sprinkle> o there he is:D
<twilight_sprinkle> sonicdude558: :|
<taoumi> lost
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst I only saw the 2 episodes I saw here, but yes, it was way more down to earth than most others
*Bronysith huggles taoumi

<twilight_sprinkle> sonicdude558: i will burn you
<taoumi> hallo Bronysith
<MadSurge> 8-bit :$
<[Alpha]> me gusta
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: there are also some episodes that go heavy into the philosophical aspects of the show's concept. and they've done it right
<Vordox> I came back
<Vordox> And wtf is this
<Lil_B> dem heavy 8-Bit Kicks
<RaveBrony> Lol
<twilight_sprinkle> hell naw

<[Alpha]> Also a Derpy Collectable :)
<Sumica> 00,10please dont post video links dureing stream
<RaveBrony> ^
<sonicdude558> from Comic con?
<sonicdude558> amirite
<Lil_B> I like Sublety like i´n Citiocen Kane, the way most animes do it is over the top, unless it's something like Hellsing, where it is Hillariously over the top
<Lil_B> + WAY too many troubled Characters in Animes...
<RAWRity> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/19/GzL3ssLooU-FTMnREV2kYQ2.jpg
<[Alpha]> No I got it at Hot Topic. They also had Rainbow dash
<sonicdude558> o
<sonicdude558> THAT
<sonicdude558> OH I REMEMBER NOW
<Kencolt> Lil_B: The entire point of animation, very often, is so you can show things that are NOT POSSIBLE. Over the top is part and parcel of the genre.
<sonicdude558> :|
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: better than the anime being fully about "ermahgerd look at dem explozisions" like dbz
<Vordox> Kencolt: I object.
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle yeah, I only really enjod the first Dragonbalöl where Goku was a Kid
<Vordox> Kencolt: Go watch "Here and there, now and then" :P
<MadSurge> RAWRity: "Kill 'em all" Tomino :D
<Sumica> 00,10My buddies bro, ma buddys
<Kencolt> Vordox: And go watch old Popeye cartoons. I'm saying that the original purpose of animation was to show not-possible things.
<alexxm> he knows
<[Alpha]> I watched all the DragonBalls
<twilight_sprinkle> hes just...
<Michael> howdy everypony!
<sonicdude558> hello Michael
<Vordox> Kencolt: Mickey Mouse 1920~ :P
<Vordox> He died for Nsync?!
<Sumica> 00,10oh and yes that was pinkies VA
<Vordox> NOOO
<[Alpha]> Hello Michael
<Kencolt> Vordox: Pretty improbable at the best.
*Michael hugs sonicdude558 [Alpha]

<CCCP> hi Kurra
*Michael hugs CCCP
<sonicdude558> I didn't hear it Sumica
<taoumi> film grain?
<Vordox> Kencolt: Who knows. :) There was some who tried to ccatch realism before creating it :P
<sonicdude558> :(
<Vordox> Kencolt: But do not know which began first.
<Sumica> 00,10the one with the curly pigtails
<MadSurge> Pimpslapp'd
<Sumica> 00,10she has not spoke much
<[Alpha]> this anime looks bomb
<MadSurge> Sumica: Andrea? :D
<Lil_B> Kencolt yes, over the top is good, but mostly in comedic ways (like most western Cartoons) when the anime trys to look real together with Scy Fi elements than I'm ok with it, but the way it is presented to me I often don't like, but mybe tahats just my opinion
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Kurra> hello CCCP
<MadSurge> Yaaaay :$
*CCCP hugs Michael
<Lil_B> hey CCCP :)
<Kencolt> Lil_B: Which you are entitled to.
<Sumica> 00,10damn you shinji......er I meen saji
<Kurra> anime has as much range of toonyness and realism as Russian or American animations, and that's good to have.
<sonicdude558> I can't ping him :(
<sonicdude558> or
<sonicdude558> tab dosen't work
