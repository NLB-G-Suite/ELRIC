<RAWRity> I like Bale's batman. Once you get past the voice, he's really good at showing both the more intense "batman" side of things, and the more emotional Bruce Wayne
<PurpleDoom> Gggala_ Christain bale prefers men
<Meanwhile> And hairy pits.
<Lucid> Rainbow Dash x Maverick from Top Gun

<Batman> 11RANDOM HARVEY TRIVIA: After seeing his performance in Thank You for Smoking, Christopher Nolan thought that Aaron Eckhart would be perfect for the role of District Attorney Harvey Dent.
<DSNesmith> I think all the acting was better in Batman Begins... except Ledger of course

<PeanutButterWolf> audible gasp
<Batman> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Early in the film, a witness on stand pulls a gun out on Harvey Dent (Two-Face) during the trial and tries to shoot him. This is a nod towards Two-Face's original origin story in the comics where in a similar trial scenario, crime boss Sal Maroni is on stand and throws sulfuric acid in Dent's face resulting in his scarring.
<Robin> 4Man, that's some really Italian stuff there
<KamenRiderFluttershy> Fuck your face!

<Pegacorn> You suck Robim
<EspyLacopa> I'm not sure it's /possible/ to do Robin in a serious movie.
<Batman> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Harvey Dent disarms the witness in court, he removes the magazine from the stock and holds it in his small finger. This is actually the correct procedure for emergency reloads and correcting malfunctions.
<Rezo> Robin is practically an icon of the homosexual agenda
<Soarin> Harvey: my people need me /fly
<Pegacorn> *Robin
<DSNesmith> Jim Gordon, one of the only good guys Gary Oldman has ever played

<Darf14> ....yes
<Razyn> 0Didja balls drop off?
<Batman> 11There several references to the fall of the Roman republic in the movie. The first is when Bruce meets Harvey at the restaurant and Harvey mentions how the Romans would offer unlimited power to a single citizen to guide them through a crisis. Rachel's character incorrectly states that the last person to get this mantle was Gaius Julius Caesar
<Batman> 11in actuality, Caesar coerced the Roman senate to give him this power.
<DSNesmith> heeeeyyyyyyy...
<RobotPinkie> Black Dynamite can't take The Joker? puh-leeze...

<EmmettBrown> How did he kniow?
<TheJoker> Mane6 stream?
<Nomikos> D-do you want to hear how I got this cutie mark?
<Batman> 11Furthermore, in ancient times Caesar represented chaos (as evidenced by Lucan's civil war - where Caesar invokes fortune or chance before he goes crosses the Rubicon and goes to war against Rome) much like the Joker or Harvey later on in this movie.
<RAWRity> INCOMING MEME

<DSNesmith> TO CHINA
<Keifru> Dude, just chill out
<mib_5u2o77> SING
<Pinchy> THIS IS BAT COUNTRY
<Batman> 11Another reference to the fall of the Roman republic is the fact that Jim Gordon, Harvey Dent and Batman form an agreement. In modern times the agreement to control the senate by Caesar, Pompey the Great, and Crassus (the financier of the venture) was known as the first triumvirate.
<Robin> 4Sophisticated. Puns.
<NightLight> sing what?
<Robin> 4Wut?
<prince-dari> Oh God the Batman voice.

<Clayface> 2,14 yeah sorry, was never the joker
<Robin> 4@DuskShine: SHHHHHHHHH....no one's supposed to know my secret identity
<PeanutButterWolf> Wouldn't want you to catch cold.
<Batman> 11Batman, Gordon, and Harvey are similarly trying to control Gotham. As mentioned above Harvey represents Cicero at first (the model citizen) and then Caesar when he becomes a villain. Gordon is Pompey, the aging general who is trying to do good, and thinks this is the only way how. Batman is Crassus, as he brings together and finances the venture.
<General_Hazard> Dude Bruce is wearing pink that's SO BADASS
<Clayface> 2,14 but I do a good impression don't I? :P

<Batman> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Heath Ledger directed both homemade videos that the Joker sends to GCN himself. The first video involving the fake Batman was done under Nolan's supervision. Nolan thought Ledger had done so well with that sequence, he felt there was no need for him to be there when it came time to film the scene where reporter Mike Engel reads the
<Batman> 11reads the Joker's statement. He put his trust in Ledger and let him do whatever he wanted, ultimately pleased with the result after he'd seen the outcome.
<everfreenights> that scared the hell out of me when I first saw it.

<RAWRity> don't worry applebloom you're a big pony now. Maybe this way you'll get your Batman Symbol Cutie Mark
<Batman> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: It's Sir Michael Caine's opinion that Heath Ledger beat the odds and topped Jack Nicholson's Joker from Batman: "Jack was like a clown figure, benign but wicked, maybe a killer old uncle. He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath's gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he's like a really scary psychopath.
<Batman> 11He's a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture." Caine bases this belief on a scene where the Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne's penthouse. He'd never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed he gave Caine such a fright he forgot his lines.

<Batman> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The infamous interrogation scene originally ended with Batman, after getting the information he needs from the Joker and dropping him on the ground, quickly kicking the Joker in the head right before he leaves to save Rachel, almost as an afterthought. However, this part was removed in editing because director Christopher Nolan
<Batman> 11felt the action seemed "a little too petulant for Batman".

<Meanwhile> Hi
<prince-dari> Explosives.
<Batman> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When the Joker tells Batman where Harvey and Rachel are being held, both addresses have hidden meaning. 250 52nd Street sounds like 50/50, an allusion to Harvey's coin flipping. Avenue X and Cicero alludes to the fact that the Joker figured out that Rachel and "Batman" used to be an item (Avenue X (ex)).

<Batman> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The film uses numerous elements of the Joker's first appearance in Batman #1, published in 1940. In both The Dark Knight and Batman #1, the Joker publicly announces his crimes before committing them, removes his make-up and disguises himself as a police officer to gain access to a person he threatened to kill,

<Batman> 11uses a powerful bomb smuggled into jail to escape, steals and kills not for personal gain but simply to create chaos and disorder, and infringes upon the city's old-fashioned mobsters.

Two of Gambol's thugs he stabs while looking up. He kills Gambol while looking at another thug. He throws the cigar lighting Lau on fire and turns to talk to The Chechen as Lau dies.
<RAWRity> It's kind of weird that Joker is obviously making shit up as he goes along half the time
<Batman> 11The two he looks at are the thug he kills with a pencil, the policeman stopping the semi-truck before the chase, and the policeman that is clearing the hospital out which he shoots with a pistol while in a nurse uniform. This character choice is a reference to the graphic novel 'The Man Who Laughs' in which it is mentioned that The Joker "just opened fire and

<Dr_Octopus> 10everfreenights yup
<Batman> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA REPEAT: In the scene outside the hospital, just before it finally explodes, the explosives onset had stalled, hence Heath improvised the scene and played around with the bomb remote.
<Jyvbrony> yeah a hospital just ahppened to blow up while they were filming
<Ghosties> 4Just goes to show how a tiny improvisation can make a world of difference. It made Joker so much more awesome
<everfreenights> THAT WAS GENIOUS IMPROV

<Batman> 11RANDOM TWO-FACE TRIVIA: Aaron Eckhart enjoyed wearing the Two-Face makeup and warned: "When you look at him, you should get sick to your stomach. It's like you would feel if you met someone whose face had pretty much been ripped off or burned off with acid. There are fans on the Internet who have drawn versions of what they think it looks like,
<Batman> 11and I can tell you this: They're thinking small. Chris has gone way farther than people think."

<Reaver021> Batman watches you Pee.
<Meanwhile> GLaDOS, give the front up servers a buzz.
<Elky> this is highly unethical
<mib_5u2o77> BATMAN IS WATCHING YOU MASTERBATE
<Batman> 11RANDOM EFFECTS TRIVIA: Two-Face's disfigurement was created through computer graphics rather than prosthetic make-up, as director Christopher Nolan felt that, no matter how good the make-up was, it is still inherently adding something onto an actor's face, when Two-Face's appearance requires part of his face to be burned away.
<Synros> this is.....wrong
<GLaDOS> Meanwhile *standby*
<Jyvbrony> no one pony should have all that power
<PrincessCelestia> thats wrong

<Batman> 11RANDOM TWO-FACE TRIVIA: Christopher Nolan asked Aaron Eckhart not to perform any tics or slurping noises as Two-Face to make the character less "showy".
*Spectrum hugs Luna.
*Thunder_Dash hugs Luna again
*DuskShine hugs Luna and prays that nopony gets sent to the moon.

<Jyvbrony> yeah, thats what a detonator looks like
<SpikelyWhiplash> For science.
<PeanutButterWolf> I didn't know Chicago had ferries
<DSNesmith> now, here's the most interesting question of the movie: Is it the detonator to the other boat, or did the Joker intentionally give them the detonators to their own?

<DSNesmith> but I can't recall the name
<Dashite> "All ya'll are fukken idiots."
<Ghosties> 4It makes more sense for the Joker to hand them the other's detonators. Though, admittedly, if he gave them their own detonators then that means he seeks anarchy regardless
<PurpleDoom> no sir, mr. rainbow-derp. Entirely "herbal" free

The unique equilibrium for this game is a Pareto-suboptimal solution-that is, rational choice leads the two players to both play defect even though each player's individual reward would be greater if they both played cooperatively.

<clear_runway> oh yeah, the prisoners dillemma! i rmember that!
<Batman> 11If one group decides to blow up the other, they go free (cooperation, so to speak, with the Joker) and vice versa. Otherwise, they'll run the risk of being blown up themselves.

<Batman> 11RANDOM JOKER TRIVIA: Jerry Robinson, one of the original creators of the Joker back in 1940, was hired as a consultant on the film (the Joker is to be portrayed according to his first two appearances in the comics, which Robinson was involved in). His "Batman" co-creatorBob Kane had earlier been hired as a consultant for Batman.

<Clayface> 2,14 but it was still first, and thus awesome :P
<Batman> 11RANDOM THEME TRIVIA: The Batman theme is heard only twice in the film, as Composers Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard decided that a heroic theme that a viewer could hum would ignore the complexity and darkness of the character. Hearing the tune only twice would create what Zimmer calls "a musical foreshadowing."
<Dashite> Salute, it's a genie

<Zephirdd> dats some money alright

<interior_gummy> stare master
<Awesomeadam76> 0Anyone seen Re-Animator yet?
<zackogenic> whoops
<Batman> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The first four days of scheduled shooting resulted in no film being rolled. Instead,Christopher Nolan screened two films for the cast and crew with a break in between. The eight films were (in order): Heat, Cat People, Citizen Kane, King Kong, Batman Begins, Black Sunday, A Clockwork Orange, and Stalag 17.
<Elky> stare master? Ugh, worst episode
<Dashite> WINDOWS!
<RAWRity> I'm glad there won't be a Robin in the series. I like the character, but for the tone Nolan's set, it just wouldn't work.
<anonpony> yee
<Baka52> black lantern twoface?
<Soarin> nope
<thegreatandpowerfulpattap> yay stare mare
<DuskShine> I haven't seen Re-Animator.
<TravelTech> Nobody cares about the credits music
<zackogenic> robin rocks
<interior_gummy> any predictions on the # of chicken jokes?
<DuskShine> So this is a new experience for me.
<PinkyPyro> yes blacklantern twoface
<zackogenic> *Robin
<durger> I've not seen the re-animator. looking foward to it
<TwilightSparkle> STARE MASTER?!? Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yeeeees!!!
<zackogenic> you mean scootaloo?
<Batman> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The only Batman movie where Batman does not use a batarang.
<DuskShine> I hope it's a magical adventure full of wonder and SCIENCE!
<DSNesmith> oh man having to sit through citizen kane and King Kong in one day
<clear_runway> griffon the brush-off is worst episode
<Riders> I see the allegory perfectly. It's just not preachy or intrusive
<zackogenic> yes
<zackogenic> yes it is
<Ersatz> Lies and Slander!
<Batman> 11FINAL MOVIE TRIVIA: Christian Bale got to keep the Batman mask from the movie, after filming. He wanted to keep the entire uniform but he did not have enough room for it.
<TravelTech> Batman, that is amazing
<salute> 0alright back
<Baka52> but that would mean making another green lanter movie
<Spectrum> I haven't seen reanimator either.
<DSNesmith> ... not enough room?
<MirrorImage> well... that assumes that the 6-shooter on Batman's wrist doesn't count @Trivia
<Crazyjay> SWEETIE BELL SINGING SOON\
<Ersatz> Those things on his forearm were totally batarangs.
<Pegacorn> SLANDERMAN
<DSNesmith> what does he live in a cupboard
<Awesomeadam76> 0I want the mask though
<Synros> becuase Batarangs are for hackers
<rivets> enough room? does he live in a trailer?
<Meanwhile> Bale couldn't fit it all in
<Ersatz> They were just mechanically launched.
<Baka52> and god knows we cant have another one
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> It just seems like a huge stretch to me
<durger> oh shi-
<Aponymous> Re-Animator is awesome.
<Thunder_Dash> What's Re-Animator about? Never even heard of it before XD
<Silverscreen> 11 3 minutes to next show, people.
<DuskShine> Christian Bale living in a cupboard confirmed for canon.

<Dash_With_Rainbows> alright cool
<Stargazer> no batarangs come back. those were just flaying blades
<DarthVader> 0What's re-animater?

<Awesomeadam76> 0I want to see it

*DSNesmith twists key
<salute> 0oh god he has cupcakes!
<Ziltoid> Re-animator is based on H.P lovecraft book

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Next time I get picked for B movie though (if that happens), I have the best movie planned...
<logan> 0why a tiemr
<TravelTech> Twilight can't disarm it!
<The_Si_Batman> A BOBM.
<Luna> 07how did it feel Crazyjay?
<PeanutButterWolf> I'm pretty sure The Fall (2006) is an A movie
<Darken_S_> are we picking the next films tonight?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> The title alone is completely epic
<Pegacorn> SOMEPONY'S NUMBER CAME UP
<TrollightSparkle> I'm back
<Dashite> OH GOD JC! A BOMB!
<The_Si_Batman> *BOMB
<Awesomeadam76> 0Crazyjay, i did it 2 days ago
<Elky> nice crazyjay
<PinkyPyro> would have sucked if a fish hit the button as it was sinking to the sea floor
<Crazyjay> it was good.... it was really good
<logan> 0what is this
<a041744> The Fall is a pretty cool movie
*NightShade suddenly opens the doors, gets on the floor and then everybody walked the dinosaur
<clear_runway> nevar telling anyone
<Arcus> wait wait wait, is it based of herbert west: reanimator? I thought it was just a cool name
<Nyst> stupid question; how scary is the next movie?
<rivets> I haven't figured out how to do the Brony Reveal without coming off like a pedophile
<Awesomeadam76> 0Is walking the dinosour
<TravelTech> Who can possibly save us from this bomb!?
<TwilightSparkle> Can somepony please give applebloomcutie24 the ropes? she's new here.
<MirrorImage> Nyst - if it's a B-movie, that should be descriptive enough
<quill> hah
<rivets> difficulty: a lot of people think I'm a pedophile already
<Rainbow-Derp> this is from inception
<Nittany_Tiger> I snuck my "reveal" to a whole forum.
<Marzai> 12The ropes?
<Nyst> Funny scary? Blood and gore scary? Psychologically scary?
<Reaver021> at 0:21 seconds I will be GOD TIER.
<logan> 0Iheart inception
<anonpony> gory
<Nyst> Thanks
<mariomarc> what is the next movie?

<PeanutButterWolf> Fritz The Cat is A and B movie.

<MirrorImage> everfreenights: saturday
<Crazyjay> i just told my best friend the truth. i fucking love the show, i read fanfics i go on ED like every day.... he understood
<PeanutButterWolf> B because of furries.
<Stargazer> hey, has inception been shown as an A movie here yet?
<Nyst> It's those movies that get inside your head I can't take
<TwilightSparkle> I mean introduce your selfs to applebloomcutie24
<PeanutButterWolf> And it's old
<Nittany_Tiger> It has.
<RobotPinkie> Re-Animator is a good movie.
<Reaver021> Hrmm...next Movie should be...SAVING PRIVATE RYAN?
<Crazyjay> we all have guilty pleasures
<Rainbow-Derp> pedo how?
<Spazturtle> rivets its worse for me I work with children, If i tell people I like MLP what are they gonna think?
<interior_gummy> would borat be an a movie or a b movie?
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The serrated edges on the side of the Batman's gauntlets were inspired by the pulp character Tony Quinn, the Black Bat, whose origin (he was a district attorney victim of an acid flinging gangster) was borrowed for Two-Face.
<Luna> 07yes Stargazer
<MirrorImage> Stargazer: 2 weeks ago, i believe
<PinkyPyro> its gory thats about it
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> We saw Inception already
<Awesomeadam76> 0My friend wasnt so willing to accept...
<TravelTech> 1 minute till detonation
<prince-dari> We've already shown Saving Private Ryan.
<salute> 0can't read fast enofe...
<mariomarc> hi applebloomcutie24
<Ziltoid> OH SHIT
<PeanutButterWolf> Saving Private Ryan and Inception have already played
<mib_zthnr3> www.ponyvspony.com
<PeanutButterWolf> "STRANGER"
<interior_gummy> would borat be an a movie or a b movie?
<RAWRity> so I'll probably be signing off for a while during re-animator, 'cause I wanna work on my NaPoWriMo entry.
<quill> word, when my older brother found out, he called me a closet faggot and said all bronies were pedo's ... lol
<Stargazer> ah. thanks. must have missed it
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Commando would be fun

<mib_zthnr3> play thet till its done
<NightShade> we need some killer klowns from outerspace
*Ghosties 4wishes he could have been there for Saving Private Ryan
<EmmettBrown> Can we have Back to the future?
<Awesomeadam76> 0Hey, silverscreen, i thought it was the last trivia!!!

<Reaver021> Ghosties, are you saying that Saving Private Ryan has already happened here!?

<Dashite> Silverscreen, I thought you said you didn't want your pudding anymore. :(
<herospirit> ER IST TOT!!!!
<clear_runway> oh, it is lovecraft. i thought you were all joking
<mib_u1u0c2> yup.

<The_Si> Trippin'
<Ghosties> 4Perfect sense
<Silverscreen> 11I swear, half of the horror music in that era was done the exact same way.
<Ersatz> Lovecraft wrote this. It's a comedy. No, really.

<Thunder_Dash> I DON'T WANT YOUR DAMN LIFE, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS?
<lemonloaf> Silverscreen: just like all the new action movie music is the same
<mib_bhexlp> I DON'T WANT YOUR DAMN LIFE, WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO WITH THIS?
<Ziltoid> This is kinda silly
<RobotPinkie> Not really a comedy, and it does take "some" liberties with the story.
<logan> :0
<Rainbow-Derp> DSNesmith yeah it's losely based but still based on love craft
<Aponymous> This movie is the BEST thing.
<DSNesmith> we need to watch The Thing in here

*Spectrum curls up on a pillow.
<mib_bhexlp> DEMAND TO SEE LIFE'S MANAGER
<Dashite> DSNesmith, I could go with that.
*Silverscreen 11predicts that there will be a lot of giggle at the ghosties references through this movie.
<SirReginald> I know anon
<Ghosties> 4...Campbell?
<GamerGodJones> We should watch Soylent Green
<RobotPinkie> I've read pretty much everything Lovecraft wrote. :P

<DSNesmith> u scared everfreenights
<Caramel> 2,14 Silver: You forgot zombie ponies :P
<CopperCogs> ...I THINK I CAN FINALLY GET ON SYNCHTUBE AGAIN
*ReticentSmolder has a 1400 page anthology of H.P. Lovecraft poems and short stories...hasn't seen this movie
*Silverscreen 11returns to eating his pudding.
<MirrorImage> only the french version actually mentions zombies
<mib_bhexlp> MAKE LIFE RUE THE DAY LIFE DECIDED TO GIVE LIFE LIFE, DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?
<DSNesmith> "Alright everybody, we're gonna do a blood test..."
<Ersatz> I love Lovecraft's ideas but his writing style is headache inducing.
<Darf14> yay, more human anatomy
*Spectrum kinda wishes he had somepony to snuggle, but eh. Foreveralone.

<clear_runway> ARKHAM
*Spectrum snuggles back.
*DuskShine nuzzles Spectrum with his muzzle.
<GamerGodJones> Was lovecraft racist? because the cat in one of his stories was named "Niggerman" or somthing like that
<shadowLurker> Spectrum, i feel ya, bro
<everfreenights> LIVE YOU EYELESS FOOL, LIVE@
<DuskShine> Nuzzle Nuzzle.
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Very loosely adapted from H.P. Lovecraft's "Herbert West - Re-Animator".
<mariomarc> does the joker work here?
<ReticentSmolder> dem tittays
<clear_runway> are those tits?
<ZSabotage> your prognosis? he's fucked
<rivets> lovecraft was SO racist
<Ersatz> He was, GamerGodJones
*NightShade joins the group snuggle
<PrincessCelestia> niggerman?
<Meanwhile> ReAnimator trivia: The original story by H.P.Lovecraft only had 6 chapters, each from 2 to 5 pages long.
<logan> Wow three snuggles for Spectrum
<mib_bhexlp> I'M GONNA GET MY SATANISTS TO CREATE COMBUSTABLE LIFE THAT'LL BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN.
<Silverscreen> 11"very loosely"

*DecapKing hugs Luna, ON THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNAAAAAAAAA
<Nittany_Tiger> Zap that bitch.
<Silverscreen> 11That's every movie adaption ever made.
<sotha> My brother has the H.P. Lovecraft anthology book, but I haven't read any of his works..
<Baka52> damnit the dubbledown took another one
<tieflingbutterfly> Lovecraft was very racist, but he was educated, at least.
<ReticentSmolder> @Silverscreen VERY loosely, considering it takes place in a totally different time period
<Gwen> keep watchen the blinkenlights
<Xaneco> ._.
<Spectrum> DEFIBS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY
<Darken_S_> isn't there a new lovecraft movie coming out from the people that made that silent film a couple of years ago?
<Dash_With_Rainbows> 25 point penalty for using defibs

<logan> heeeeh..
