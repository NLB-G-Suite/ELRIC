<drfsupercenter> 03in high school its just a status thing
<Polydunami> Hey Calcos323 :)
<MahBoi777> hey Calcos323
<Vordox> How do you change a frame rate in runtime for causing a uneven syncronization with a tween, also within runtime.
<Aster> Why isn't there a rule against spamming lyrics during a song ?
<Biglaw> Hiya Calcos3232
<DaringDude> Sumica you missed the LivingTombstone mod
<Umbreon> then they skip BCD and 98 or lower is an F
<AppleBloom> hi Calcos323
<RyunosukeKnT> evening everyone :)
<Calcos323> Ping pingity ping ping ping
<drfsupercenter> 03because A is a 4.0 and B is a 3.0, regardless of the +/-

<SheenaFox> nice
<Biglaw> OOooh Yeah!
<drfsupercenter> 03but not rounding if they're going to do straigh A/B/C? That's a bit harsh XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<otakon> Aster: as long as it isn't done AFTER the song is over it's fine, but the autokick is still in effect though
<drfsupercenter> 03that's you being Asian
<SheenaFox> :'D
*drfsupercenter runs
<MahBoi777> evenin RyunosukeKnT
<AppleBloom> element
<mitamaking> There is a song spam rule?
<otakon> so, 5 in 10 while Wrek|Observing is here is KICK
<Vordox> Or add a control of it within the FPS limit, and "removes" time to sync up
*Unnr really needs to finish their pony + Who Wants To Live Forever PMV)

<Kandarihu|> I play Engineer by building a Dispenser, upgrading it to full, then building a Sentry next to the Dispenser. Then I move both devices to where they're more useful, and just spend the whole time repairing them.
<Dken2021> SunderlandPony89 eeyup, game community needs better ettiquite right now
*GarrettBrony burning rubber tires
<Renard> Interestingly, I'm focusing less on audio / graphics / gameplay in modern games than on publisher's trust to its audience

<otakon> Renard: try out Dark Soul's
<Alister> I'm gonna go to sleep guys !
<cow334> hello every one i got disconnected

<Ninjazz> Someone needs help with Dead Money?
<Ryanier128> Ninjazz I know, but my research proves that his blood boiled, his brain exploded, and he would be un-recoverable, so I believe him to be a clone, not a zombie
<Sumica> 00,10let me drop combat and you can take over Shizuka

<Dken2021> Litwick sounds awful
<SunderlandPony891> Litwick: At least your internet does'nt randomly cut out
<TheHoodyNinja> sorry Litwick i fell off of the chat and it cried so much at my loss
<Ninjazz> Ryanier128: Game says he is revived... Although the very fact that his body shouldn't even exist more than dust particles. He is resurrected as himself with a few extras.
<Litwick> It randomly cuts out too.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> What's unacceptable is a Shizu stream around Midnight on a school night
<Ninjazz> kenne: Where are you right now?
<Shizuka> 13<3
<SunderlandPony891> Litwick: Who's your internet serive provider? Mine's Mediacom, and they suck

<Dken2021> I didn't know megatron works at sonic
<CupcakeWarrior> She always dresses in style
<Shizuka> 13i'd like a number two combo, yessssss
<Everlasting_Joy> I remember Black Arachnia and Cheetor having some relationship that converted BA to the Maximals. It was awesome.
<Colt_of_Personality> Sure he has built in jet boosters that let him fly, but he wouldn't be complete without the skates
<Phase4`> i like how they can stick a t-rex on rollerskates and with context it seems totaly reasonable
<Shizuka> 13not til season 3 Everlasting_Joy
<Kencolt> That's a horrible thought. Having a 'cn deliver my chicago dog.
<Shizuka> 13Phase4`: a PURPLE trex no less
<CupcakeWarrior> Blackarachnia always dresses in style
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Everlasting_Joy: not with cheetor, but silverbolt

<Dken2021> eh, don't mind watching it
<Wishbone> yes.
<Ninjazz> wow that is the cutest dog ever...
<Deadlypon3> ...Can I say Wishbone is at least...not offensive
<Wishbone> I know right Ninjazz?
<CupcakeWarrior> How do you get a vhs on the computer?
<Kandarihu> A while ago, someone jokes around claiming that PETA got this show cancelled, and I believed it and claimed it myself, thinking it to be real. Come to think of it, this really isn't animal abuse.
<Shizuka> 13i've done it the other way before, took a rendered video out to VNS
<Dken2021> hey it 's the kid who saved the unicorn
<CupcakeWarrior> vns?
<Everlasting_Joy> CupcakeWarrior TV tuners are the first things that come to mind.
<Kandarihu> The breed of dog that Wishbone is is pretty well known for being VERY easy to train.
<Deadlypon3> I always think whenever Wishbone is showing a different ending to a story, Wishbone just alters it in his mind to make it awesome to him :p
<Shizuka> 13er VHS... this torrent is all over the place though... most are DVD rips, some are ripped from a philadelphia PBS, some are VHS like this one
<Shizuka> 13but yeah this quality really is bad, if you want to switch do ask
<Sparkle-Pone> Hello everypony!
<Deadlypon3> ...And it's red
<Deadlypon3> A red List for medical issues
<Colt_of_Personality> What about the episode where Wishbone is Alex in a Clockwork orange and gets beaten up by homeless guys? That wasn't animal abuse?
<Vinyl> Haha

<Sumica> 00,10was wondering what it was saying on that
<Stardust_Phoenix> all I remember about clockwork orange is lacing the milk with acid for a little bit of the ultraviolence
<Kandarihu> Dat OSD
<Shizuka> 13input says the same on FMLE
<Sumica> 00,10spiffy
<Deadlypon3> Wishbone just imagines himself in the role :P
<CupcakeWarrior> Is Clockwork Orange good?
<Shizuka> 13and that OSD doesn't look much out of place either
<Shizuka> 13i think most of them use 128k mp3
<Deadlypon3> Oh yeah, Cupcakewarrior...but it's really disturbing
<Deadlypon3> The movie and book

<Deadlypon3> JRT?
<CupcakeWarrior> I would hate to dream about classical literature
<Everlasting_Joy> Jack Russel Terrier
<TheHoodyNinja> I AM MADE OF CHEESE!
<Ryanier128> what a twist!
<drfsupercenter> The quote I choose to write about is at the end of Canto XXVIII, when Bertran de Born says "Because I cut the bonds of those so joined, I bear my head cut off from its life-source, which is back there, alas, within its trunk. In me you see the perfect contrapasso!" This quote is meaningful because it explains to the reader the concept of contrapasso, which we already knew was an important theme in Inferno. Howeve
<Cipher> 0,14check please
<drfsupercenter> 03darn it
<drfsupercenter> 03where did that cut off
<CupcakeWarrior> dat terrible acting

<stalker_oo> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> Helloooo
<Deadlypon3> Helloooooo
<Colt_of_Personality> Totally thought Nathaniel suffocated in his sleep...that woulda been dark and awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03However, not only does he mention the word, but he EXPLAINS it. Bertran de Born (according to the notes) is accused of causing Prince Henry's rebellion in England, and thus metaphorically "cutting bonds" in the royal family. Dante then goes on to explain how Bertran de Born's punishment is to have his head cut off, similar to how he cut the "head" off the English monarchy. It's a very peculiar example to use, but
<Deadlypon3> NOAH WAYH!
<Ryanier128> no shit!

<ctcb> If Discord had a son and took him over, like, with magic, and he was a GOOD pony, living in ponyville, what would be the best way to creep in the discord voice, whilst still keeping the son's normal voice, e.g: making the voice degrade more in to Discord scene by scene, whilst keeping the character voice of the son?
<Shizuka> 13she calculates a 33.3% chance of victory, repeating of course
<ctcb> I'm doing a small project, I need some thoughts...
<Shizuka> 13which is better than they usually do

<Shizuka> 13everyone knows that
<Shizuka> 13it's because berliners don't call it a berliner, they call it a Pfannkuchen because that's what it is
<Shizuka> 13it's elsewhere in germany that donut is known as a berliner
<Ninjazz> :D
<SteveCharb> just like how you can't get a Boston Creme Donut in Boston

<Shane377> i basically only watch 3 tv shows
<Shane377> Mlp Castle and the voice

*Spectrum_Rush no offense Ninjazz but your dad isn't ready to be a true man...
<XAX> I don't watch TV in general. NOTHING plays on TV here that I wanna watch.

<Mutterguy> cake is a lie? have a flan instead!
<Kandarihu> Spell-of-Gaming: I don't mind the "Cake is a Lie" meme. That at least has some role in the canon it comes from. Molestia is purely viewer generated.
<rainbowdash002> if u want ponies go to netflix or youtube
<pony_8105> im so patheti-i-ic!
<Trixie> I think pony_810 5 is trollestia
<LightTrooper105> its not that bright
<pony_8105> im not trollesta
<Invi> or molestia

<Ninjazz> Its funny watching the Dynamics of Internet Memes.
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> that joke is way too old now ninjazz
<Invi> Ninjazz nothing replaces ever the cakelie
<Trixie> pony_8105 still no excuse to be immature
<Ninjazz> Invi: It has become less prevelant.
<pony_8105> listen to me everybodyyyyyyyy!!!
<Invi> Ninjazz that's true
<Spectrum_Rush> no
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> yay the molester is gone
<Digitalis> ..

<Skydroid> No worries
<LightTrooper105> eeyup

<Dishwasher_EXTREME> ohh wait he still here FUCK
<Spectrum_Rush> Vulcan?

<Ninjazz> Tarku!
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> its ok i made that mistake once
<Spectrum_Rush> haio Tarku
<LightTrooper105> hello Tarku
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hugs Tarku :3
<Kandarihu> Trollestia and Wingboner memes come from subjective viewing. It can all be explained out of canon. Cake is a Lie subverted itself at the end of the first game. Molestia has no in-canon precident.
*Ninjazz hugs Tarku
<pony_8105> my life is ruined
*LightTrooper105 dies from hugs
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> OMG A NEW MOLESTER
<Trixie> lol

<Spectrum_Rush> smoosh

<Invi> That's true Digitalis
<Ninjazz> Kandarihu: FUS RO DAH replaced This is SpartAAAAAAAAAA
<Skydroid> I hate being average height
<LightTrooper105> you enjoy killing them dont you Sumi..
<Spectrum_Rush> well considering wing-boner is just ponified penis joke...

<pony_8105> you treated me like a bully
<Ninjazz> ^
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> what the hay
<pony_8105> i am not a molester
<Spell-of-Gaming> Kandarihu, so what you're saying, Cake is a lie = Canon, Molesta = Fanon, and it doesn't deserve to be compared?
<Ninjazz> Well, you acted like a little kid. What did you want us to do? Coddle you? No, this is the internet.
<Kandarihu> Frankly, I don't mind either. I actually started getting into All Your Base at the time when people started getting tired of it.
*Phase4- hugs pony_8105

<Ascendant> no shakespeare stuff at all?
<Ascendant> wtf
<Ninjazz> wtf...
<ofna01> One of the main reasons i enjoy being part of the Brony society (apart from obvious love of the show) is that everypony in this fandom abides by the "love and tolerance" rule. Everypony is so nice, theres no hate and all opinions are welcomed. If﻿ the world was more like the Brony society, there wouldnt be any wars, everything would be fine. That is why i am proud to be Brony!

<drf-Droid> core ones like math/science/English were both semesters
<Ninjazz> No DickShep option?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm not afraid of needles, but only just the feel of it. When I was sewing, I got poked by a needle accidently
<Dishwasher_EXTREME> needles not so bad
<Irres> Most people end up with 6 classes anyway.
<Ascendant> 10 for year 12 Drake
<Ascendant> I have 5 classes or something
<Ascendant> or maybe 6

<Ninjazz> U shouldn't have done that...
<Ascendant> that's 7 actually
<Spell-of-Gaming> But it's just shiver-y when you get poked

<Twi_Fi> I can offer no real explanation for that.
<Wrek|Observing> 05yes.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> therefor i never hug ,lick,huggle or anything like that
<Twi_Fi> I was trying to hide from being poked so I climbed a tree, which happened to grow cheese.

<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek|Observing: would you have any recommendations For a Starting artist?
<RainBowJack> Sumica no more Armor piercing rounds?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> DONT DRAW NAKED GIRLS

<Twi_Fi> Wrek, do you have a deviantart account?
<Ingwaz> sumica is getting his flank kicked
<Meanwhile> Yes. Yes he is.
<Ingwaz> but this is probably on insanity isnt it
<FlareChaser> Seriously, I had like 10 people asking me for help.
<Digitalis> actually if you are drawing humans, using artistic nudes is helpful
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek|Observing: like programs to use if SAI is to advanced
<RainBowJack> Sumicas PLOT is going to get killed
<FlareChaser> Meanwhile, why dont you like Trixie?
<Meanwhile> Because she's an annoying douchebag.
<Ingwaz> you're still under fire
<Twi_Fi> Poor Trixie.

<Ingwaz> you're taking fire on occasion is the only thing i can think of sumica
<FlareChaser> Thats mean.
<FlareChaser> yay
<Meanwhile> As always, my name isn't Nicewhile.
<Ingwaz> some of the bullets looked like they were above your cover sumica, so maybe it was counting it as hitting?
<RainBowJack> Sumica was in cover
<dishwasher_EXTREME> its not anything to fancy but better than that Windows Paint right ?
<Spectrum_Rush> like i want to draw but i also wanna vector things
<RainBowJack> the smae happend to me in ME 1
<Ingwaz> what gun is that?

<Ascendant> tired
<Ascendant> I wanna sleep

<Twi_Fi> Wrek, I had asked if you had a deviantart page, but I think somepony asked about the program you used to.
<Twi_Fi> *too
<Wrek|Observing> 05yes, johntb.deviantart.com
<Meanwhile> I like the way cinderblock sounds.
<Xanbreon> Go to bed noob
<Ingwaz> dishwasher_EXTREME: Meanwhile has a private relationship with the cinderblock, so they do these kinds of things together
<FlareChaser> 1 second, I gotta watch this Youtube video...
<dishwasher_EXTREME> again...why cinderblock
<Twi_Fi> Thanks Wrek|Observing, :)
<Spectrum_Rush> would you have any recommendations For a Starting artist? Wrek|Observing
<Spectrum_Rush> if im not buggin you that is
*Twi_Fi can't draw.
<Ingwaz> sound?
<Wrek|Observing> 05practice practice practice.
*Twi_Fi is sad by this fact.
<Wrek|Observing> 05you cant draw snouts? focus on them
<Wrek|Observing> 05suck at drawing cloth? focus on that even more
<Ingwaz> its too bad they made adepts more of a biotic nuisance rather than a biotic god like they were in me1
<dishwasher_EXTREME> hey you guys should really watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv5iEK-IEzw
<Digitalis> ugh cloth is a bitch
<Ingwaz> in me2 i mean
*Spectrum_Rush know that feel Twi_fi hugs
<Spectrum_Rush> Twi_Fi
<Digitalis> which reminds me... i have to do my lessons before my school ends up sending me a letter.
<Wrek|Observing> 05ive come to realize a great analogy. If art was a skill in fallout. talented peopel would just have 40points when they start rather than the default 20. but you still need practice to reach 100.
<Ingwaz> lol, video game analogies about real life are always the most effective
<FlareChaser> ....Genius.
<pony_7777> greater words have never been spoken
<Meanwhile> Idk I think Einstein said some greater words.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> anyone watch it yet ?
<FlareChaser> okay gotta go guys bye
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek|Observing: thx, wat about programs to use i mean if SAI isnt good for a begginer,last question
<Meanwhile> Seeya fla...gone.
<Wrek|Observing> 05how do you think i got good at hair and eyes?
<RainBowJack> Sumica Moved Luna :(
<Wrek|Observing> 05i practiced them
<Wrek|Observing> 05right now im tryign to get cloth right
<Wrek|Observing> 05so i practice that
<dishwasher_EXTREME> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv5iEK-IEzw
<Ingwaz> fortunately for you wrek, ponies dont wear clothes, unless its kinky saddle time
<Wrek|Observing> 05dishwasher_EXTREME: no link during streams
<Wrek|Observing> 05image links are an exception
<Spectrum_Rush> Ingwaz: oh u
<dishwasher_EXTREME> whah? ohh right the rules
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I cant stop listening to PinkiePieSwear musics
<RX-78-SweetieBot> today
<Ingwaz> slap them with a singularity?
<Ascendant> heya Xanbreon
<Xanbreon> Hai NS

<Xanbreon> How goes?
<Ascendant> tired
<Ascendant> nearly 12
<Ascendant> halfway through my essay

<Xanbreon> damn
<Meanwhile> Sumica is dickshep.
<Ascendant> actually

<Twi_Fi> dishwasher_EXTREME, just finished the vid.
<Ascendant> 794 out of 1200 words
<RainBowJack> DAT PLOT
<Ascendant> might be able to sleep before 1
<dishwasher_EXTREME> like it ?
<Radu> Have a season 2 survey: http://derpy.me/ZRRUL
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, goodmornig everyone
<Meanwhile> The Project. Because they had no one in charge of naming it.
<Meanwhile> Allo TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<Litwick> Good morning everypony
<Meanwhile> Allo Litwick.
<Twi_Fi> dishwasher_EXTREME, yeah I lol at a couple of parts.
<Spectrum_Rush> hi
<Twi_Fi> Hi Litwick.
<drf-Droid> hurry up and do it already
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Morning Litwick
<dishwasher_EXTREME> lol I'LL KILL U WITH A TRAY
<Ingwaz> Sumica: space magic, and now its legit
<Meanwhile> 2 days?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> so this game is 2 days from me3
<Meanwhile> Pfft. "2 days?! I gotta get to Walmart!"
<Airpuff> What.. is this? xD
<Spectrum_Rush> BUM BUM Morning of the Second Day
<Twi_Fi> dishwasher_EXTREME, I liked, "This isn't a game of 'who the f#@k are you?'"
<dishwasher_EXTREME> jeff vader
<ekips> 48 hours left
<Spectrum_Rush> ekips yay
<Ingwaz> shepard is not the brightest...
<Twi_Fi> Take him down to China town!
<Airpuff> Lol.. why not point a gun at someone.. and then just let your eyes wander all over the place? xD
<Ingwaz> airpuff like this? 6_9
<Airpuff> Ahaha, She just didnt know what went wrong right? xD
<Ingwaz> someone sneaking up on you sumica
<Wrek|Observing> 05curse this poll for including worst episode
<Wrek|Observing> 05I cannot pick
<Radu> I choosed The Mystertious Mare Do Well
<Phase4-> and then shepard died
<Phase4-> the cycle continued
<Radu> Mysterious*
<Airpuff> =O
<Ingwaz> indeed Wrek|Observing, and i think the question about season 2 being better is a bit flawed. i think season 1 and season 2 were about even in awesomeness
<Meanwhile> Glitch in the system.
<ekips> Lazarus 2.0?
<Phase4-> season 2 seemed to experiment
<Airpuff> Why not watch Lesson Zero?
<Ingwaz> Sumica: your eyes are messed up man
<Airpuff> Love that episode. =o
<Meanwhile> Shepard PAWNCH
<Ingwaz> Phase4-: yeah, season 2 was definitely different from s1, but it was quite good
<drf-Droid> ohgod
*Phase4- thinks season 2 is better
<drf-Droid> we started talking about domestic violence
<Meanwhile> Agreed.
<Ingwaz> Phase4-: i think theyre equally good for different reasons
<drf-Droid> anyway, got a 10 min break before next class
<Airpuff> I loved em bouth xD
<Wrek|Observing> 05I am 100% satisfied with season 2.
<Phase4-> ^
<Ingwaz> i miss season 1's random pinkie pie songs, which were awesome!
<alexxm> i liked both seasons
<Twi_Fi> I like ponies.
<Meanwhile> Season 1 was good. But not as good as season 2 imo.
<Radu> Indeed, Meanwhile
<Wrek|Observing> 05I got what I expected, I ask nothign more from it.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> i dont know...all of my favorite episode r in season 2
*RX-78-SweetieBot just barely stops from making a meanwhile x trixie joke
<Phase4-> no mele for robots
<Radu> Indeed, Wrek
<Cypresswolf> S2 did experiment with quite a lot, what I noticed most were better animation details, shading, and facail expressions. Watch the first few eps from S1 and compare - huge difference
<Airpuff> Some parts about season two is just unbeatable though
<Phase4-> boom
<Airpuff> Discord Arc was just fantastic xD
<Ingwaz> lol Wrek|Observing, i think we got a bit more than we were expecting, the finale was way more than i expected
<Phase4-> those eyes
<Twi_Fi> I was worried the finale would suck.
<Phase4-> Sumica: put your glasses back on
<dishwasher_EXTREME> i must have rewatch the finale like 20 times its awesome
<Ascendant> 838 words now
<Commander_Shepard> Your galaxy is in sight
<Ingwaz> i still wish the finale had gone in to a bit more of detail on pony lore regarding alicorns
<Ascendant> though thats pretty much just 44 words
<Ascendant> lol
<Xanbreon> What are you writing about?
<Ascendant> urgh I hate essays, bro
<drf-Droid> ...a hangman game called Hanging With Friends
<drf-Droid> sounds legit
<alexxm> perhaps in season 3 Ingwaz
<drf-Droid> :P
*Phase4- hugs Sumica
<Wrek|Observing> 05sure some episodes gave more than expected of them. finale being one of those. but if i start expecting that. then thats not fair for the writers.
<Ascendant> about a book called Emma and a film called Clueless
<Xanbreon> Fun
<Ascendant> doing some appropriation crap
<Xanbreon> Sounds like BS
<Airpuff> Very true.
<Twi_Fi> I expect perfection, always.
<Ascendant> To what extent has the composer of the contemporary text appropriated the ideas and values contained in the earlier text to say something new?
<drf-Droid> so you're writing about how you're Clueless about Emma?
*drf-Droid runs
<Ingwaz> indeed Wrek|Observing, i was just saying that they definitely did the finale right
<Ascendant> lmfao
<Xanbreon> NS is well into emma mate
<Xanbreon> *wink*
<Ghollghost> Hello everyone! :D
<Twi_Fi> Hello Ghollghost.
<Ingwaz> right now my only hope for s3 is they continue as they have been and make it 26 episodes instead of just the possible 13 we already know about
<drf-Droid> LOL
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> twi_fi you must expext disapointment next to perfection
<alexxm> hey Ghollghost hows your day been
<Phase4-> Ingwaz: they didnt realy characterize cadence differently to any other character
<Ingwaz> if its 26, i will probably joygasm
<Radu> Don't forget to complete the Season 2 survey: http://derpy.me/ZRRUL I'm very curious to see everyone's opinions
<Phase4-> it'll be 26
<Radu> Really Phase4-?
<Ingwaz> indeed Phase4- which is why i would like more info on pony lore, so we can tell how celestia and cadance are different
<MysticLugia> 02huh? ah idc
<somepony_else> well i was thinking that alicorns could be a result of inbreeding in royal families.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> its late now bye guys see you tommorow
<Twi_Fi> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, yes, I know. That's why I become depressed quite easily.
<Ghollghost> Just fine thanks alexxm, drinking monster energy all day long <3 yours? :)
<alexxm> good Ghollghost
<Ingwaz> somepony_else: i think inbreeding probably has no place in mlp
<Phase4-> Radu: lets say cadence was a unicorn. what changes
<Airpuff> Oo i didnt know about this survey =O I'll take it now
<Twi_Fi> Bye dishwasher_EXTREME.
<Phase4-> except for the one scene where she uses her wings
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> twi_fi then you should aim for the better not to perfection
<alexxm> cya dishwasher_EXTREME
<dishwasher_EXTREME> by the way where does cadence come from
<Phase4-> infact twi calls her a unicorn more than once
<Ingwaz> the theory that she is only half royal blood makes sense and keeps celestia and luna as the immortal god-kings without causing problems

<Cypresswolf> I think with the following the show has gained this season, the show will continue beyond season 3's projected 13 eps, Hasbro isn't going to end the series while the running's hot
<Radu> Honestly, I don't think Luna ever used her horn
<somepony_else> just compare it to royalty in europe... almost everyone is related to everyone else... this thing seems to have been quite common in the past
<Twi_Fi> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, lol, I have been told that by so many people, I have gotten better at not being so black and white.
<Ingwaz> Cypresswolf: that would be the logical thing to do, i just hope that hasbro does the logical thing. companies have shown me their thinking is not always logical
<dishwasher_EXTREME> is cadence luna's daughter
<Radu> Nah^
<Meanwhile> You're tearing us apart Sheaprd.
<Phase4-> dishwasher_EXTREME: nope
<Ingwaz> Sumica: you're a biotic, you dont need your gear, you have your mind
<Phase4-> Meanwhile: /)
<Meanwhile> Phase4-: (\
<dishwasher_EXTREME> so who is she
<alexxm> i heard the 13 episodes were just what was ordered at the start of season 2 Cypresswolf
<Twi_Fi> So how does being a biotic work exactly?
<Radu> Cadence is a princess. It's like asking who Kate would be
<Ingwaz> pyro wants a hug!!
<Phase4-> dishwasher_EXTREME: *shrugs* not luna, she was around when twi was a filly
<Meanwhile> Implants that allow them to manipulate mass effect fields.
<Meanwhile> In a nutshell anyway
<Ingwaz> i think you mean wasnt Phase4-
<Phase4-> i did
<Twi_Fi> Now this begs the question, what are mass effect fields?
<Phase4-> *derp*
<Wrek|Observing> 05if you ask me it was originally intended for luna and celestia to be the only alicorns. but with the whole candence thing i think was jsut to get some toys out originally.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> so celestia have other sisiter
<Ingwaz> Twi_Fi: theyre dark energy fields used to raise, lower or shred
<Cypresswolf> Hasbro's been pretty cool so far, I still have yet to here of copyright infringement claims when it comes to fanmade customs of their .... whatsitcalled...
<dishwasher_EXTREME> sister
<Meanwhile> Twi_Fi: The basis for technology in the ME universe, stemming from the Mass Relays.
<Phase4-> Wrek: thats my other guess, they made here an alicorn later to sell toys
