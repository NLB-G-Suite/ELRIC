<DoctoDoctorWho> Here
<DoctoDoctorWho> Here is a subject I have been wanting to adress for a while, who would win? Broly first contact or perfect cell?
<Mutterguy> Buu
<therainbowvortex> perfect cell DoctoDoctorWho
<DeathStar> Mutterguy: it's pronouced moo
<NocturnalBlade> :D
<therainbowvortex> DoctoDoctorWho: broly was beating by goku right
<Mutterguy> wut...
<RoboGerbil> ghost nappa wins all
<Mutterguy> VEGETA VEGETA!
<DoctoDoctorWho> honestly I dont think anypony has my side when there are debates, Broly would win.
<DoctoDoctorWho> therainbowvortex: yes, yes he was
<AdamTheDuck> Those sounds...
*DeathStar grabs DoctoDoctorWho s side "I got it!"
<Mutterguy> i was wondering where the video was
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: No! My left side! Meh, I guess Ill be all right...
<therainbowvortex> DoctoDoctorWho: and cell killed goku goku couldnt get the job done so gohan did thus making broly weker then cell
<Mutterguy> hai
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Wrek's voice
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: I'm sorry you didn't specify :(
<DeathStar> smexy voice :D
<therainbowvortex> DoctoDoctorWho: sorry but thats just my opion
<Mutterguy> therainbowvortex it's not your left side that's missing
<therainbowvortex> Mutterguy: wat
<Mutterguy> AND KNOWING IS HALF THE BATTLE
<NocturnalBlade> ok, i know you just started streaming Wrek but i'm almost falling asleep at the PC :D
<DeathStar> G.I JOOOOOOOOOOEEEE!!!
<NocturnalBlade> so i shall take my leave ^_^
<therainbowvortex> Mutterguy: can u plz explain im confused :(
*Mutterguy brohooves DeadpoolDash
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight NocturnalBlade
<Mutterguy> oops DeathStar
<DoctoDoctorWho> therainbowvortex: But think about it, broly wiped the floor with all 4 of the super saiyan z fighters and piccolo, simultaniously, without trying. Cell had to ensure his survival by challenging them 1 at a time, and hr still had a rough time in fights. In 1v1.
<taoumi> this game looks familiar
*DeathStar brohooves Mutterguy
<NocturnalBlade> good night guys ^_^ thanks for the stream Wrek :3
<DeathStar> night night NocturnalBlade
<Mutterguy> DoctoDoctorWho was complaining he was missing his left side so he was all right. In this case he'd be more sorry than you
*DeathStar dances
<therainbowvortex> DoctoDoctorWho: in that case broly would win soz i havent seen all of the movie but your right if thats what hapaned
<taoumi> night NocturnalBlade
*Mutterguy safety dances
<Fersure> http://butteryobread.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/tumblr_m0i2lqkr0o1qf04v7o1_500.jpg
*DeathStar dances dangerously >:3
<Mutterguy> (\ (\
<Mutterguy> /) /)
<DoctoDoctorWho> therainbowvortex: not to mention that cell claimed(but never proved he could) he could destroy an entire solar system, whereas broly destroyed an entire GALAXY, within story. we watched it happen
<DeathStar> (\ /)
<Mutterguy> oh mai :3
*NocturnalBlade hugs taoumi AdamTheDuck and DeathStar :)
<DeathStar> /) (\
<MaidSurge> taoumi: the game is Marathon
<taoumi> mmmmmmm
<DoctoDoctorWho> therainbowvortex: but I proved my point so whatever
<therainbowvortex> DoctoDoctorWho: hey like i said ive never seen broly fight and i agree with you
<Mutterguy> oh btw XKCD proved that theoritically piccolo has already glassed the earth...
<Moopy> Im back and got me some snacks and what type of freakin game is that?
<therainbowvortex> DoctoDoctorWho: but do u lke dbz
<Mutterguy> the energy required to blow up the moon would have ignited the atmosphere
<DeathStar> Mutterguy: that's no moon O_O
<DoctoDoctorWho> therainbowvortex: love it, and I can pm you the fight between broly and the z fighters in pm if you want
<DeathStar> sorry sorry I had too ^^;
<Mutterguy> :O It's you!
<Moopy> Hmph
<therainbowvortex> DoctoDoctorWho: yes plz that would be awsome
<DoctoDoctorWho> redundancy is redundant
<Mutterguy> /me points to DeathStar in case someone doesn't get it
<DeathStar> :3
<taoumi> some times i wish all games had a panic knife
<Mutterguy> DeathStar i hope you don't ask anyone 'Does my bum look big in this?'
<DeathStar> Mutterguy: I never do. 1 because you can never tell weather the person is being honest or not and 2 I have a tiny butt anyway
<Mutterguy> what? relative to other space stations?
<Mutterguy> :P
<DeathStar> Mutterguy: yeah other space stations have huge asses XD
<Mutterguy> SO Wrek, what's with the genocide?
<AdamTheDuck> This looks like a Doom level :$
<MadSurge> DeathStar: I have a tiny ass too :D
<jjjhjhgmfuykf> .
<DeathStar> MadSurge: yay :D we can be tiny ass buddies!.... or not that sounds weird....
<Mutterguy> hehehe
<MadSurge> DeathStar: :D not for me!
<DeathStar> MadSurge: yay tiny ass buddys then :D
<MadSurge> Egh, my stream keeps lagging
*MadSurge pulls out 3DS and plays more Tales of the Abyss
<Ryunosuke> ...
<taoumi> yey legs machined togeather
<MadSurge> So many corpses
<taoumi> man those elevators. they work
<taoumi> the word katar alwase reminds me of voldo from the soul edge/caliber series
<MadSurge> taoumi: actually my nick is thanks to Voldo :D
<taoumi> lol is that one of his moves?
<taoumi> i pride my self at being ok at all the charicters of soul caliber. but when it comes to voldo i jsut eat the contoler and watch the fire works
<MadSurge> taoumi: now follow me, do you remember Soulcalibur 2's arcade?
<taoumi> mhmm
<taoumi> vaugely
<MadSurge> I wanted to put in Mad Surgeon in Conquest mode but wouldn't fit in :D
<taoumi> ah~ now it makes sence
<MadSurge> taoumi: though Mad Surge makes still sense, and would never trade it
<MadSurge> Also agreed, Voldo is ace
<taoumi> i haven't tryed my hand at SC5 but SC4 runined it for me w/ the critical finishes
<MadSurge> taoumi: they're better
<taoumi> it changed the game
<taoumi> well soul edge and sould caliber used to be all about the counter game
<MadSurge> taoumi: they're still there but not a one hit kill, more like Street Fighter supers
<taoumi> eeeh it's still rewarding the atack spamer and that's kinda .... meh
<MadSurge> taoumi: kinda
<taoumi> that was my favoret part of soul caliber. the people that would coem over from street fighter or DoA and think they can combo their way to victory
<MadSurge> taoumi: :D poor fools
<taoumi> and be like. lolololololol i'm going to use 2 buttons to crush you
<taoumi> guard and kick
<MadSurge> *boop*

<killerpony7733> Gold_Demona therainbowvortex Life is a cruel and hard thing. Sometimes it gives people the worst the exprience burned into our vary fabric of being. To rise above that and realise the past never has to effect you maybe not in what you do it defined who you are. Exprience is both painful and joyful but never give up cause you can one day break the cycle and become the better person

<RaveBrony> Good night, NewSuperBronyU|Zzz!
<Cypresswolf> BUT I dont work for his business partner - for the last month, everything I do is suspicious to that guy :| before september, he didnt give a fuck what I did nor asked me questions on where I've been, what I did, as long as I got what they needed done

<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02If someone fell asleep on the stream, I don't see any trouble with posting vid links. But if the streamer speaks up to not post video links, then that's when you stop :)
<Cypresswolf> Listening to 2 bosses aint worth working the family business anymore :| its like have a devil on both shoulders, shouting orders, all the while each contradicting each other

<Cypresswolf> Finding some good stuff this morning - Tenacious D - Kickapony ^_^
<MadSurge> Never watched Fairy Oddparents
<Cypresswolf> NSFW if you decide to look it up - strong language
<MadSurge> What was the episode about, Lyra`?
<Ponies47> To bad the show got cancelled before some speical about a baby or something was supposed to come out. :/
<Jmo> Da pick of destiny.
<RaveBrony> Hmm?
<MadSurge> Ponies47: a baby also voiced by Tara Strong :D
<RaveBrony> Yep :D
<Lyra`> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/247757_10151446196064966_81011142_n.jpg
<Cypresswolf> clean version of Kickapony is not clean - still strong language :S
<RaveBrony> Pfffft, spiders, lol
<Cypresswolf> :3 Along 290 outbound from Cypress, there's a road called Kickapoo
<Cypresswolf> And there's your useless fact of the day
<XAX> Are there stream?
<Cypresswolf> I dont think Tenacious D is safe to post this early in the morning :$
<MadSurge> XAX: not really
<XAX> Also, horre shet 65 people.
<XAX> MadSurge: Define not really...
<Ponies47> 65 is pretty small for this channel
<RaveBrony> Wow :o
<RaveBrony> Only 65??
<MadSurge> PANIC
<MadSurge> WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE
<RaveBrony> Aahh!!!
*RaveBrony hits the "Panic" button
<XAX> So is there one or not? I wanna share a video D:
<MadSurge> XAX: Wrek went to nap and left a Eddie Izzard dvd running, but now it's over
<XAX> Oh.
<XAX> well... sneaky
<XAX> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnVWW3rODdg
<MadSurge> XAX: So I think sharing videos is okay
<Gold_Demona> XAX: Super said we could post video links until Wrek wakes up and makes us stop.
<RaveBrony> inb4 kick ;)
<RaveBrony> ^
<MadSurge> Does someone here have brothers or sisters btw? I'm curious :D
<Gold_Demona> I have one younger sister
<Saturn> 08,01hey Phase4: http://i.imgur.com/YPy4c.png
<RaveBrony> Ive got an older and younger bro
<Ponies47> I have a older bro and he is a complete jerk
<RaveBrony> :I
<MadSurge> I personally have a younger bro, he's almost 18 now
<Cypresswolf> Ohai Saturn
<MadSurge> Saturn: that post is wrong, isn't it?
<RaveBrony> Lol, Saturn :D
<XAX> Saturn: I don't know too much, so I'm not sure whether to laugh my ass off at all the wrong or agree with that.
<MadSurge> ^
<XAX> I know the whole apple/Microsoft bit at the end is BS, but iunno about the rest.
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: of course not, it's preposterous that someone can run the Linux without the underlying support of Windows drivers
<Cypresswolf> :3 An aged pony video - Confound These Ponies - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_3ryX7Fhy0
<MadSurge> Saturn: Ahh
<Gold_Demona> My younger sister is 26. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: she's my age :O
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, come on, a hobby community project making a whole operating system?
<XAX> Saturn: oh yeah totally
<MadSurge> Saturn: yeah, sounds kinda silly now that I think of it :D
<Saturn> 08,01remember that Apple tried and failed, and eventually moved to Microsoft
<XAX> .-.
<Cypresswolf> Yesh, video! Drinking pony is Best Pony :D
<XAX> but
<XAX> oh me.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: does your sister look older? :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Nope. In fact she appears much younger than she is.
<XAX> And suddenly we're asking about eachothers sisters.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Doesn't help that she has a learning disability.
<XAX> .-.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: well, my brother looks older than me now :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: learning disability? :O
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Her brain has trouble with speech comprehension.
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq_r19xoKJE
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Kinda like dyslexia but with spoken words instead of written ones
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: poor thing :(
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, she's had it rough. Doesn't help I was a huge bully to her growing up. >__>
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I'm not anymore, but it's still something I'm ashamed of
<Jmo> Tsk tsk tsk
*XAX is listening to Paradise.
<XAX> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1jevWbVAzQ
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: we all have stuff to be ashamed off, so no worries
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: she doesn't hold grudges, I hope
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Nope
<Gold_Demona> Thanksfully
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: then it's all okay! :)
<Gold_Demona> Yep
<killerpony7733> Yesh
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: having a brother at 9 year old helped, I was just happy for having a baby bro
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Gold_Demona> My sister and I are two years apart, so I don't remember not having her around. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: even if now we're the opposite of each other, we still kinda like each other :D
<XAX> I have a sister, 3 years younger than me.
<killerpony7733> I got a big sister and shes like 5 years older then me >.>

<Mega_Milk> wow
<Mega_Milk> i have headphones on
<killerpony7733> Mega_Milk What headphones?
<Mega_Milk> and i can faintly hear things going on in wrek's house
<Mega_Milk> killerpony7733: There nothing special
<Mega_Milk> someones in wreks kitchen -lol
<Mega_Milk> messing with glasses
<Gold_Demona> Is it a zombie? D:
<Mega_Milk> now they opened something...
<Mega_Milk> and there also wearing house shoes
<Mega_Milk> cause they cant freakin PICK UP THERE FEET!
<Mega_Milk> so all i here is sliding every now and again
<killerpony7733> Mega_Milk Dayum you got one heck of a auditory sense
<Gold_Demona> How you hear this? I hear nothing. O_o
<puffmuffins> hi
<killerpony7733> I hear white noise mostly
<Mega_Milk> killerpony7733: No these headphones are insanely loud
<DoshWithReenbows> You appear to be a stalker by saying that, Mega_Milk
<Mega_Milk> DoshWithReenbows: I was actually modding tf2
<killerpony7733> Mega_Milk Ah makes sense. Mine are a bit screwy tbh
<Gold_Demona> Are you actually peeking into Wrek's window and telling us what he's doing? D:<
<Mega_Milk> DoshWithReenbows: And i forgot i left BS going
<Mega_Milk> DoshWithReenbows: And I keep hearing noises
<Mega_Milk> DoshWithReenbows: Then I realized im hearing wrek's house
<Mega_Milk> and somepony is stirring about over there.
<Gold_Demona> I hear nothing, and I maxxed my volume. o_o
<Mega_Milk> killerpony7733: even at the lowest volume these headphones blast loud
<Sylandest> Mega_Milk: I be stirring mah breakfast, if that counts?
<Mega_Milk> Sylandest: :D
<Sylandest> also, morning everypony :)
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Do you have headphones on?
<Mega_Milk> Sylandest: Morning.
<Gold_Demona> Mega_Milk: Nope
<killerpony7733> Mega_Milk Either they are high quality or just plain odd but yeah i'm impressed
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: You need head phones
<Mega_Milk> killerpony7733: I got these from a dollar store -lol
<Gold_Demona> All I hear is white noise that kinda sounds like a screeching tea kettle.
<killerpony7733> Mega_Milk Cheap ones so guess it makes sense
<Mega_Milk> no tea
<Mega_Milk> killerpony7733: Yeah the more expensive head phones have filters that prevent ear damage
<Mega_Milk> killerpony7733: Cheap ones have no filter so you can easily go def with these things if you expose them too long -lol
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: What you hear is a fan
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: He has one going
<Gold_Demona> Ah
<Mega_Milk> or atleast there one somewhere in there

<Mega_Milk> yeah i think there about to have dinner
<Mega_Milk> shes laying out plates
<Mega_Milk> and speaking with someone
<Kammerjunk> This is probably the most fun I've had in weeks.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Mega_Milk> -lol XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk I hear nothing! And I have headphones in
<Gold_Demona> Listening in on Wrek's life. XD
<Spectrum_Rush> http://derpiboo.ru/117478 mechromancer
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: Crank thembitches to the max and listen really really carefully
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk, the are to the max. Stream and computer volume
<Snow> DAMMIt
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, I don't hear anything right now either, I guess the computer's not close enough to where the sounds are. But somehow Mega_Milk can hear them.
<Snow> just had it
<Mega_Milk> -lol I can hear everything!
<Kammerjunk> I can hear something.
<Kammerjunk> Plates'n'stuff.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk must have dem fanceh speakers in his campooter
<Mega_Milk> Kammerjunk: Yes!
<Kammerjunk> I just turned my volume up a bit. So whenever I get pinged, my ears cry bloody tears.
<Mega_Milk> Kammerjunk: Thats it! the clanking of the plates as you she pulls them out
<Kammerjunk> So thanks for that.
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: No -lol I got me some dollar tree headphones! XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk, how the fuck?
<Mega_Milk> Kammerjunk: Yeah that is the price to listening
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: XD I dont know apparently I got the one good set from the ghetto dollar tree :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> I have in noise-cancelling headphones and can't hear shit in the background
<Gold_Demona> ASoftFluffyThing: My guess is Mega_Mik has some super fancy headphones that cancels out white noise. >.>
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: XD -lol maybe :3
<Mega_Milk> yeah there eating :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> This is going to be interesting to tell Wrek.
<Mega_Milk> -lol :D
<Gold_Demona> I heard a clanking! Very very faint...
<Kammerjunk> I can hear the white noise from the TV (It's also making my ears cry, by the way), but I can still hear plates and stuff.
<Mega_Milk> Kammerjunk: Do you also hear them talking?
<Gold_Demona> No
<Gold_Demona> I hear no talking
<Mega_Milk> Kammerjunk: And the knives on the plates?
<Mega_Milk> Kammerjunk: And the fan?
<Mega_Milk> there was also some running water a moment ago
<Gold_Demona> I hear a fan, and I hear the whistling kettle noise.
<Mega_Milk> possibly a bathroom
<ASoftFluffyThing> I hear nothiiiiiiiiiiing.
<Kammerjunk> I hear the knives and the fan, but not the talking right now. I fear turning my headphones further up, for my ears would bleed.
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: XD maybe I do just have really good ears then -lol
*ASoftFluffyThing has on noise-cancelling earbuds
<Gold_Demona> ASoftFluffyThing: Not even white noise?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Not even white noise
<Mega_Milk> yeah I can hear it all pretty clearly now
<Gold_Demona> ASoftFluffyThing: By noise-cancelling, do you mean the noise around YOU or the noise coming from the headphones?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Gold_Demona, the noise around me
<ASoftFluffyThing> I hear nothing coming from the headphones
<Gold_Demona> It shouldn't be cancelling the white noise then... Odd. O_o
<Kammerjunk> Fine, I'll turn my headphones further up so I can hear potential talking, but if my ears bleed, I'm sending you the bill.
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: Try unpluggin the headphones and hear just with your speakers
<Mega_Milk> Kammerjunk: XD i cant make outanything there saying.
<Kammerjunk> Oh wait, I have free health care.
<Mega_Milk> Kammerjunk: But they seem to be just talking casually
<Mega_Milk> no kind of emotion
<Mega_Milk> no laughtwer
<Mega_Milk> no yelling
<Mega_Milk> just neutral
<Kammerjunk> Sounds like my family.
<Mega_Milk> -lol
<ASoftFluffyThing> Nothing from the speakers except the soft sound of my laptop fan
<Dragonmatte> Just tried the Peta games... Wow
<Spectrum_Rush> sounds like sweden :S
<Dragonmatte> All dem bloods :2
*Spectrum_Rush badum tssh
<Gold_Demona> Dragonmatte: ikr?
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: Hmmmmm I dont understand it you should atleast hear the plates
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Can you hear the clanking of the plates?
<Gold_Demona> I hear the plates
<ASoftFluffyThing> I don't.
<Mega_Milk> and the knives against the plates
<Kammerjunk> I can hear it, Master. The clanking, the never-ending clanking.
<ASoftFluffyThing> the speakers for my computer are low, even on 10%
<Mega_Milk> Kammerjunk: :D
<Dragonmatte> Gold_Demona: I mean, i don't care how it's made, it's still delicious :3
<Gold_Demona> It's hard to make out over the white noise, but I hear the plates.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Now if I were using my sister's computer, yeah I could probably hear it.
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: Then use it woman! XD Im not sure why im enjoying this but i am! -lol
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: Just casual.....
<Gold_Demona> Dragonmatte: I can get behind not wanting animals to be abused before we kill them to be eaten, but they're way beyond ridiculous.
<ASoftFluffyThing> My sis has her laptop, and she's at school atm
<Mega_Milk> ah
<Mega_Milk> Im kinda interested to here more
<Mega_Milk> but i cant go any farther than wreks bedroom -lol
<ASoftFluffyThing> I just want to hear something besides the silence in my earbuds
<Dark92Enigma> hello everypony
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: XD
<Kammerjunk> If only his Sniper poster could speak to us.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hello, Dark92Enigma

<Dragonmatte> Gold_Demona: Yep, i mean what they do to animals isn't nice, but not all places do so
<Kammerjunk> Dark92Enigma: Wait, you ALSO have a dog named Luna?
<Dark92Enigma> so i have to buy new ones

<Kammerjunk> Dark92Enigma: We're listening to Wrek's house!
<Mega_Milk> and Gold_Demona
<Dark92Enigma> i can't listen anything
<Mega_Milk> but ASoftFluffyThing cant hear it :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> ^
<Dark92Enigma> Neither can i
<Mega_Milk> its nothing super great
<Gold_Demona> All I hear is the clanking plates. Mega_Milk can somehow hear them talking.
<Mega_Milk> there just eating in silence now
<ASoftFluffyThing> Everyone has magic ears except me.
<Mega_Milk> there are just 2 of them
<Kammerjunk> I'm a magic man, I got magic hands.
<Mega_Milk> but im pretty sure wrek is still PO'ed in his bed
<Mega_Milk> i cant hear his breathing or anything over the fan
<ASoftFluffyThing> I can't even hear a fan.
<Mega_Milk> but i didnt hear his foot steps so he didnt leave the bed
<Gold_Demona> The only time I heard voice was what the one lady came to wake Wrek up.
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: its blended with the white noise.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk, darn.
<Mega_Milk> Gold_Demona: Yeah i told you she was walking around the house! -lol
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lol is anybody recording this?

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, everyone! Happy birthday, MLP! :)
<Invi> sumi, what if one of your robots dies? is it then dead forever or just the battle?
<Invi> hai AJIsAwesome
<MadSurge> Invi: just for the battle
<Caramel> 2,14 depends on the mech and the mission
*AJIsAwesome hugs Invi :)
<MadSurge> Invi: but you have to spend money on the repairs
<Snow> oh god
<Vivix> Yo AJIsAwesome
*Invi huggies AJIsAwesome back ^^
*AJIsAwesome hugs Vivix :)
*Jmo slaps AJIsAwesome around a bit with a large trout

<MadSurge> ^^^^^
<Kimori> butter toast
<BladedWings|HW> i really wish this was in english...or that i could read Japanese XD
<MadSurge> MAX OUT ALL UNITS AND PILOTS
<Caramel> 2,14 to summarize what I just did
<Caramel> 2,14 spent my money to upgrade the new mechs
<MadSurge> BladedWings|HW: the story is always a crisis where characters from different mangas/cartoons converge to fight a common threat :D
<Caramel> 2,14 used my pilot's stat points to give them nice abilities, like support defense and hit and run
<Snow> dat dialouge
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Caramel> 2,14 if the majority of the chat could read it, I'd show you it :P
<AJIsAwesome> I wish. :D
<Caramel> 2,14 but since I'm trying to entertain, I'm skipping the stuff you can't read :P
<Snow> i could read some of it, but not all of it
<Barbetos|AtWork> I can read just about zero kanji
<BladedWings|HW> MadSurge: well thats cool and all i just want to be able to know what da buck i'm attacking with XD
<Barbetos|AtWork> Or whatever it is
<Shizuka> 13http://i.minus.com/ibfFv8QzkaL7kE.png

<Barbetos|AtWork> I did not play at all for last years TF2 haloween stuff
<Snow> @Shizuka: you mean in general or the tf2 update?
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome, not before I buy it all
<Shizuka> 13yes
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: You better not. :D
<MadSurge> BladedWings|HW: the GBA games are translated and playable if you're interested, but those still featured Original Characters exclusively
<Caramel> 2,14 not entirely
<ASoftFluffyThing> ASoftFluffyThing, oh really?
<Jmo> o.o
<Caramel> 2,14 they still had Mazinger and Dancougar, etc
<AJIsAwesome> Did you just ping yourself, ASoftFluffyThing? :D
<Barbetos|AtWork> It will be a combo of the pumpkin head guy, the ghastly gibus ghost, and the eye I bet.

<Snow> THE BALLS ARE INNER-wait...

<Barbetos|AtWork> Derpy goes to deliver mail. Some how she ends up in a universe full of japanese anime mechs.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Logic.
<MadSurge> Barbetos|AtWork: all in a day's work
<Snow> O_O
<Barbetos|AtWork> Naturally.
<AJIsAwesome> Makes sense to me.
<Snow> DAYUM
<Invi> that could have killed 3 of them at once...
<MadSurge> Still don't understand why that mech makes the screen fizzle
<Snow> make that 30
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yeah. Pilots wearing glasses would never happen.
<Invi> MadSurge, because it's cool

<MadSurge> Aaaand chat derped
<AJIsAwesome> I know what a meme is. :3
<Jmo> I meant stahp.
<Vivix> meme = to copy or imitate, originally used to state animal behaviour in groups where they copied the leader (as far as I remember)
<Jmo> >.>
<Snow> Caramel: do you ever got hit normaly? that hadron blaster wasnt realy a hit.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I love the typo gusy. I say it in stead of "guys"

<Vivix> yeah- I've only seen it here
<Vivix> so I gently assuuumed
<Caramel> 2,14 namely, if you haven't played 20 times and so you have a lot of money to throw around

<Jmo> I'd buy from welovefine if they didn't charge me $20 shipping per item.
<CountDoofus> Bronysith: lucky bastard. I wish we had a Hot Topic. I'd totally get one of those Rainbow Dash industrials if we did.
<Snow> "time to rock!" "to the moon!"

<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Snow: Why don't you move it to the top of your head? :P

<soulrider95> Paying extra for that business internet is really working out this time :)
<Eddmario> BaconMane: Actually, the educational is literally the paid version, but free.
<BaconMane> 0,5And the industry uses SolidWorks more

<Shizuka> 13sealed boxes are taunting me >>
<mylittleponylover12> why is this still on?
<ASoftFluffyThing> When do you activate them?
<Shizuka> 13we'll be going to the store tonight, theoretically
<Caramel> 2,14 thanks mylittleponylover12, you sure know how to make someone feel appreciated
<MadSurge> Shizuka: for what? :3
<mylittleponylover12> srry
<Shizuka> 13to activate
<soulrider95> Caramel: I'm enjoying it! :)
<Snow> me too!
<Snow> i love this kind of games
<Jmo> ^
<mylittleponylover12> its just it been on for a long time
<Shizuka> 13need to transfer numbers over from sprint so figured it's better to do it all at once, among other things
<MadSurge> Caramel: go on, this is better than a simple Let's Play :D
<Snow> MadSurge: agreed
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, you're still with Sprint or with a different company?
<BladedWings> i like seeing giant robots blowing stuff up lol
<Shizuka> 13moving from sprint to tmobile
<ASoftFluffyThing> Aaah
<MadSurge> Caramel: when I decide to not be lazy I'll have all these awesome robot cartoons to watch thanks to you <3
<mylittleponylover12> sorry caramel
<ASoftFluffyThing> I've never had T-Mobile. I heard they're good but sometimes their service derps.
<BladedWings> i should know about that XD
*ASoftFluffyThing had The Ripoff aka Verizon
<Kandarihu> My mom and I are on Verizon. She NEEDS Verizon for it's coverage.
<Bronysith> well everypony, im off to see the wizard
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye Bronysith. Have fun.
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care Bronysith!
<BladedWings> the wonderful wizard of oz Bronysith ?
<Jmo> Toodles Bronysith
<Bronysith> BladedWings,yup
<ASoftFluffyThing> My mom had Alltell before Verizon bought them out so she had her old Alltell phone for a while
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> BYe, Bronysi-
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> HAG
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> *GAH
<Kandarihu> However, it's getting hard to afford Verizon, so we're thinking of switching to a prepaid service.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Verizon is freaking ridiculous with their prices, and you only get so little. Two dollars per megabyte
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<mylittleponylover12> so um... wat game is this?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kandarihu, Straight Talk is pretty good. Only thing you have to pay for is the phone itself and the phone card.
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> Super Robot Wars.
<Jmo> ^Lol'd
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> I don't know. :P
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kandarihu, thing is I think they use Sprint's towers. At least down here they do. I think it varies
<Kandarihu> Hmm. It would be nice if there were a prepaid service that uses Verizon's towers.
<mylittleponylover12> how many people know wat hes doing?
<Snow> ugh, i hate this chapter 15 test...
<Kandarihu> Upgrading his characters
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> It's an RPG. I'm pretty sure most of us know.
<Snow> keep getting everything wrong
<MadSurge> mylittleponylover12: he's maxing his mechs and pilot stats
<ASoftFluffyThing> I don't think there's any prepaid services that uses Verizon towers except for the Verizon pay-as-you-go phones
<AJIsAwesome|Reading> ^
<mylittleponylover12> k
<MadSurge> mylittleponylover12: count also new game plus benefits
<ASoftFluffyThing> Everything else I think is Sprint, Tracfone, or AT&T
<Kandarihu> Yeah. We kinda passed on those phones. It's too expensive.
<Jmo> I will devour your reading material AJ.

<flutterbitch> hi:|
<flutterbitch> :[ WHERE IS EVERY PONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hi flutterbitch
<alexxm> i'm herre
<Chrysalis> waited 30seconds?
<CrimsonPhoenix> ATEMON GAMUH
<Chrysalis> talk about impatient
<CrimsonPhoenix> Hai everyone
<BladedWings> hi CrimsonPhoenix
<Caramel> 2,14 just a hit and run troll
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, CrimsonPhoenix. :)
<thelonepony> hi CrimsonPhoenix
<Colt_Brovakiin> hai CrimsonPhoenix :)
<CCCP> hi CrimsonPhoenix! *hugs*
<Caramel> 2,14 tempted to just ban the IP...but I'm tired
<CountDoofus> Haio CrimsonPhoenix
<AJIsAwesome> Aw man, he wasn't the slightest bit funny.
<Colt_Brovakiin> ^
<Sonny> INTRUDE CONVERSATION MODE ACTIVATED
<Sonny> >_> <_<
<AJIsAwesome> Sonny: :D
<Sonny> xp sorry
<Sonny> right, back tod rawing
<Sonny> drawing* >_>
<Sonny> to* °-°
<thelonepony> but tod likes rawing :(
<GilDash> Tod can roar real good. XD
<Colt_Brovakiin> rawr :3
<thelonepony> Rawr :3
<AJIsAwesome> Rawr! >:3
<MadSurge> Why are there rainbows under the floor? :D
<Chrysalis> attack strong enough to wipe out a large chunk of a space armada
<Chrysalis> half damage to a single roboot
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: The beer is under the elephant.
<Chrysalis> robot*
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: in the stream silly :D
<Caramel> 2,14 an interdimensional space beast robot that can bend the fabric of reality
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: I know. :D
<Caramel> 2,14 I'd say it's well within reason
<Chrysalis> but scale, the monster can destroy hundreds of building sized enemies in a barage like that
<Chrysalis> how can a single one taking the full brunt survive
<Caramel> 2,14 indiscriminate fire
<Caramel> 2,14 if you notice, it didn't get hit by every shot
<Caramel> 2,14 it makes sense it can wipe out a space army, because there's lots of weaker targets
<Chrysalis> and this one? that rifle was shown to only barely penetrate a single target
<Chrysalis> just nearly took out a battleship with a single direct hit
<Caramel> 2,14 *sigh*
<Chrysalis> yeah im applying logic to a game based on several anime series
<Caramel> 2,14 it's a game...a game about giant robot animes, with rediculous robots that can throw galaxies at each other...just go with it
<Chrysalis> pointless
<Malmortius> Hi guys :)
<Chrysalis> gurranlagan if it was based in canon would just be OP
<Panda> GilDash -___-
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Malmortius. :)
<GilDash> Panda: Hmm?

<Yahooz> What are you doiiiiiiing
<GilDash> Panda: Is something wrong?
<BaconMane> 0,5lol
<Panda> GilDash, nope...

<Chrysalis> crotch shot
<thelonepony> ouch
<Cades> hey
<Malmortius> So how often are MLP episodes played here? I watch the streamed video reactions on youtube all the time, want to be part of one :( Wish i was a MLP fan sooner.
<pot80> Um hi... I suck at first impressions so... umm... yeah
<Stormy`> from the Google images results it looks like you're either calling me a mushroom, a flower, or some kind of insect
<Stormy`> Hey Cades
<Malmortius> and by that i mean, be a part of watching an episode, not on youtube
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai pot80 :)
<Colt_Brovakiin> welcome
<AJIsAwesome> Malmortius: I know that feel. They stream pony eps on BMN and on other days randomly. :)
<Caramel> 2,14 the episodes are streamed when they air. We don't have any control over it
<Yahooz> Malmortius: When Season 3 starts up, we stream the episodes as they air
<thelonepony> hi pot80
<pot80> thanks
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome to Bronystate, pot80 and Malmortius. :)
<Kjakings> 7it's just a latin word for stormy.
<MadSurge> Malmortius: wait until s3 is announced :3 in the meantime, stay and enjoy our other streams
<Stormy`> oh
<pot80> if id thought i'd be on here a week ago :P
<AJIsAwesome> Make sure to read the rules while you're jere. :)
<Stormy`> I figured it would be some kind of elaborate insult
<Stormy`> :P
<AJIsAwesome> *here
<Kjakings> 7Not always.
<Caramel> 2,14 that's all from me today. I've got a lot of emotional shit to deal with
<Yahooz> So many users come from reaction videos :p
<Caramel> 2,14 hope you enjoyed
*Chrysalis hugs Val
<Kjakings> 7aren't I allowed to be exhausted from school sometimes? :P
<MadSurge> pot80: We all went through that
<Chrysalis> Thanks for the stream Caramel
<Yahooz> take car Val!
<Malmortius> how longs it been since a new season of MLP?
<Stormy`> no
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Caramel. Hope you feel better. :(
<Panda> lol underlines = color?
<BladedWings> thanks for the stream Caramel
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Im tired from not doing anything all day.
<Stormy`> you're not allowed to be sou out of character
<MadSurge> Caramel: I hope you feel better soon :(
<AJIsAwesome> Malmortius: About 6 months.
<pot80> already read the rules
<Stormy`> lol sounds like me yesterday
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GOD YES http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1349902609973.jpg
<Stormy`> I was sick and basically slept all day
<thelonepony> thanks for the stream Caramel and i hope you feel better soon :(
<Yahooz> ...colors?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> well im at work
<Yahooz> really colluquy?
<Caramel> 2,14 CrimsonPhoenix: that's borderline. Were I streaming right now I'd probably warn-kick
<GilDash> Yahooz: I think it's an automatic script for any kind of formatting.
<Caramel> 2,14 so just keep that in mind
<Kjakings> 7Oh. well, you're out of luck because I'm just not in the mood for the normal witty repartee
<Yahooz> GilDash: yeah, outline
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but that doesnt mean im doing anything.
<thelonepony> oh pot80, never ask the mods for ponies
<CrimsonPhoenix> Just because it's a picture from 4chan?
<Yahooz> i dont know how my client allowed is all
<thelonepony> trust me
<AJIsAwesome> Never ask for ponies. :D
<pot80> why on earth would I ask for ponys?
<Caramel> 2,14 no, because it's a picture of trollestia using her horn as a wang
<CCCP> CrimsonPhoenix too small
<Stormy`> All I've had to do at work so far is find a bag of clickers and give it to some people
<CrimsonPhoenix> a wang? it would be a nose if you knew the reference
<thelonepony> pot80: if we ask, they'll give us the devils
<CCCP> why do bronies consider horns to be reproductive organs? :s
<thelonepony> G3.5
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<MadSurge> Caramel: that's from a Persona 4 fancomic though. Still borderline nsfw :D
<Stormy`> So I'm working on ruby on rails crap which I will never stop complaining about...
<Caramel> 2,14 it's still inapropriate
<Yahooz> fun fact: arguing with the mods increases your chances of further punishment ten fold
<Kjakings> 7what do you people even /do/?
<AJIsAwesome> CCCP: I don't know. :S
<pot80> ok i wont
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> well i can basically do as much or as little as i want… its my place.
<AJIsAwesome> I always found horns as mediums for concentrating magic.
<O-Griofa> Hey everypony
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, O-Griofa. :)
<CCCP> hi O-Griofa
<thelonepony> Hi O-Griofa
<Stormy`> Kjakings: it's a college IT helpdesk
<MadSurge> CCCP: in the original comic it was a long nose :D
<pot80> hallo
<Kjakings> 7ah
<alexxm> how are things o-Griofa
<CCCP> MadSurge lol
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: also, horns are protrunding bones
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But wednesdays are slow.
<O-Griofa> So today was a day of triumpf for me. The story goes back to the second week of the school year.
<AJIsAwesome> What happened?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I want to do a helpdesk.
<Stormy`> Since it's a work-study position there's usually very little actual work involved
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy` ever read The Bastard Operator from Hell?
<Stormy`> No
<Kjakings> 7I see.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://bofh.ntk.net/BOFH/
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its vintage but good if you like IT humor.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> like 90s stuff.
<O-Griofa> I sit on the bus everyday in the same spot, with a 3-5th grader (i havent asked) she saw i had pinkie pie as my background and then started spewing to me about MLP
<CrimsonPhoenix> well here's a more appropriate for compensation http://i.imgur.com/RAM4c.jpg
<O-Griofa> We sit there everyday, usually her talking, but its whatever.
<Kjakings> 7Y'know I've been a /lot/ calmer and more stable since I started coming here regularly again... probably somewhat ironically.
<AJIsAwesome> O-Griofa: Nice. :)
<Stormy`> "It's probably something to do with..." I look up today's excuse "... clock speed."
<Stormy`> Haha, I need to keep a list of bullshit excuses to give people when they complain...
<AJIsAwesome> I'm just going to leave this here.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its an excuse calendar
<AJIsAwesome> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xr9WcIdh0TQ&feature=channel&list=UL
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you can buy em online :)
<Stormy`> awesome
<CrimsonPhoenix> 2YEARS ALREADY
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> some of the stuff is pretty funny, some of its not
<Stormy`> If I ever need a gift for my boss I know exactly what to buy
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but its a good read when you're bored.
<CCCP> Fim is still just a little filly of a show
<O-Griofa> I met her sister, 10th grader, as am i.(shes sexy) she thought it was cool I talk to her sister out of being nice and today i asked her out, i got a yes, then i found out she is a fellow pegesister, great day for me.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> theres pages and pages and pages so theres more than enough to keep you entertained for like a month.
<Spectrum_Rush> CrimsonPhoenix: cheers http://derpiboo.ru/118928
<CCCP> O-Griofa :3
<AJIsAwesome> O-Griofa: Wow. Sounds like it was an awesome day. :)

<sub06905> ello sallymeow1
<AJIsAwesome> lexiedoodle: To nick tab, just type part of someone's name in and push tab. It's autocomplete. :)

*Stormy` facepalms
<Kjakings> 7If his last name is not cake it is a wasted opportunity
<AJIsAwesome> lexiedoodle: Bronystate is known for Brony Movie NIght, which streams 2 movies and 2 pony episodes on Friday and Saturday.
<MadSurge> CCCP: I want rain to wash my car :$
<O-Griofa> lexidoodle: plus read the rules and FAQ
<AJIsAwesome> lexiedoodle: On other days, we stream random things.
<AJIsAwesome> Like anime, games, and sometimes videos.
<Dovah> lexiedoodle: No asking for ponies, no complaining about stream, type part of nick and hit tab to talk to people and dont be irratating, that pretty much all you need to know
<CCCP> MadSurge :) rain is good for so many things :3
<thelonepony> by "we" he means the mods
<Kjakings> 7@stormy: Well, obviously. Shan't be any fun
<Kjakings> 7well. less fun
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: Yeah. :D

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Its totally fun.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Id do it.
<lexiedoodle> okay sweet c: thanks c:
<spud363> why no asking for ponies?
<thelonepony> i love Podcast Saturdays :)
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Yahooz> Details about what and what not to do come later
<Stormy`> what, ask people about their sex life on IRC or name your daughter Pinkamena?
<Yahooz> /you learn them yourself
<thelonepony> spud363: you don't wanna know
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Name my daughter Pinkamena
<sallymeow1> what happens then? (I tend never to come on saturdays)
<spud363> ok...
<Stormy`> lol
<AJIsAwesome> It seems rude to request ponies when they're streaming something else.
<Dovah> spud363: rule number one. you do not ask for them, rule number 2 you DO NOT ask for them.
<thelonepony> trust the lonepony
<Kjakings> 7I would never inflict a child with that name.
<spud363> yea but y?
<Stormy`> that's worse than Renesmee tbh
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I think its awesome.
<O-Griofa> spud363: They like to keep the ponies mixed in, so its not constantly poni's, i think. Somone correct me if im wrong
<thelonepony> G 3.6
<pot80> its funny how friday movie night starts 12:00 saturday for me
<AJIsAwesome> Because it seems rude.
<thelonepony> that's wat
<sub06905> lets just say this happens when ponies are requested: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CCwQtwIwAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVo13WMTQJ84&ei=gud1UO3IMOG0iQLNt4H4Bg&usg=AFQjCNEnyiLBq63QGJozRkOUFlEp3B6QsA&sig2=o4Zh7PaUfuoYAbbZOLJW6Q

<O-Griofa> CCCP: Wh.. What.. is. this?

<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6TdhB4LqN8 The song that this vieo remix is clearly a Kirby song but where exactly is it from?
<pot80> soo many videos
<O-Griofa> CCCP: I concur, but.. What the heck?!
<sallymeow1> maybe ill be back if theres nothing to do
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I get more nerdy and strange as I get older.
<Stormy`> haha, those aren't actually too bad
<CCCP> O-Griofa idk XD
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I know, right?!?!?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Its actually a great idea.
<thelonepony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzmnPs64K74
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Tali and Chell is pretty cool too
<Colt_Brovakiin> dammit, I can't get Dan Bull's Dishonored rap out of my head :3
<Stormy`> Not sure if I should correct you on what I actually meant, or if you're just messing with me
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I think it's from Amazing Mirror.
<CCCP> why dont they stream Nichijou on here any more? :C http://derpy.me/Dywyp
<spud363> brony compilation! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urnUYQt-9bc
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, can you be a bit more precise?
<AJIsAwesome> Give me a minute.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I think we know whats going on.
<Stormy`> I'll never name my kids after characters from anything, though
<CrimsonPhoenix> ARE YOU GOOGLING/
<CrimsonPhoenix> ?**
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I will.
<The_Awesomeness> hello everypony
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Nope.
<CrimsonPhoenix> good
<thelonepony> hi The_Awesomeness
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, The_Awesomeness. :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I value my fun over their livelyhood.
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai The_Awesomeness
<The_Awesomeness> im feeling good today what about you?
<Kjakings> 7You know your daughter will get called Pinkeye right? or something equally vaguely-connected and cruel.
<AJIsAwesome> GOT IT!
<O-Griofa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdrqdW4Miao <must see
<pot80> http://i.imgur.com/Zw3fi.gif
<The_Awesomeness> no school on friday, no homework, nothing but free time
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: It's from the final boss of the game.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, Bingo
<Stormy`> I'm pretty sure he's not being serious
<AJIsAwesome> YAY!
<Stormy`> ...pretty sure
<Kjakings> 7Idk it's SR
<Kjakings> 7he goes both ways
<Stormy`> right?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> She wont get called anything because she wont associate herself with primitive public school children.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm just getting obsess with this remix
<Kjakings> 7Private school children can be equally if not more shitty.
<CrimsonPhoenix> it just fit so well
<Stormy`> this is true; I actually got bullied a lot more when I was in private school
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Homeschooling./
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Is what I actually meant.
<Kjakings> 7Homeschooled kids tend to be /weird/. aside from that obvious bias, they'd have pretty poorly developed social skills.
<BoroBrony> hello everypony :)
<CCCP> hi BoroBrony
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> LOL
<spud363> hi
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Boodfire. :)
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai BoroBrony
<AJIsAwesome> * BoroBrony
<pot80> hi BoroPony
<Colt_Brovakiin> nice tab AJIsAwesome :P
<thelonepony> hi BoroBrony
<AJIsAwesome> Colt_Brovakiin: :P
<pot80> damnit
<BladedWings> hi BoroBrony
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I kind of proved you right.
<alexxm> how are things BoroBrony
<Kjakings> 7?
<pot80> hi BoroBrony
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I was homeschooled.
<Kjakings> 7ah.
<Kjakings> 7Then you absolutely see my point.
<Kjakings> 7Homeschooled kids grow up to be people who want to name their kids Pinkamena and Dash
<Colt_Brovakiin> I'm just gonna leave this here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPg8qKIbIYU :3
<Cranberry_Scotch> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=B_MW65XxS7s
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Except the social skills stuff, thats BS and theres no evidence to support it. I have met hundreds of homeschooled children who are better socially adapted than kids who have attended public or private schools.
<CCCP> goodbye everyone
<thelonepony> Bye CCCP
<Colt_Brovakiin> Bye CCCP :)
<BladedWings> bye CCCP
<VenHur> Bye CCCP.
<BoroBrony> anyone here red the my little dashie
<Kjakings> 7Fair enough I've really only got media-imparted ideas on the subject which were supported by a lazy logical thought train
<CrimsonPhoenix> speaking of amazing mirror
<The_Awesomeness> bye CCCP
<O-Griofa> Bye CCCP
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yeah I dont blame you.
<BoroBrony> and bye CCCP
<AJIsAwesome> BoroBrony: Some people have.
<spud363> me
<CrimsonPhoenix> I need to beat it for the 50th time now
<O-Griofa> Ill be back later guise, peaces
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVED Amazing Mirror. :D
<BoroBrony> i just did and wow
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, O-Griofa :)
<Colt_Brovakiin> Goodbye O-Griofa
<The_Awesomeness> i love how when someone enters all of us sa hi and when someone leaves we all say bye instantaniously
<ASoftFluffyThing|AFK> The_Awesomeness because we all care about each other
<CrimsonPhoenix> The_Awesomeness, that's the curse of Bronystate
<Colt_Brovakiin> The_Awesomeness: Thats because we are all lovely people <3 :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Homeschool kids tend to be more to the point, can articulate their thoughts better, and have higher self esteem and are more secure with themselves, from what I have observed.
<pot80> I'm new and its already becoming a habbit XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> you get pingstorm you meantion hai
<BoroBrony> because we care for eachother :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> even if you were here an hour ago
<ASoftFluffyThing> No stream?
<thelonepony> because we wbub them :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> example
<CrimsonPhoenix> HEY GUYS
<AJIsAwesome> Nope. :)
<thelonepony> no stream
<thelonepony> wub*
<spud363> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0sW8KrZF5s
<MadSurge> The_Awesomeness: Friendship is Magic after all :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> from grades 3-9 they have trouble relating to other kids who are not also homeschooled because their interests are usually different.
<thelonepony> wat?
<Colt_Brovakiin> ^
<The_Awesomeness> friendship is also witchcraft
<Spectrum_Rush> CrimsonPhoenix: doesn't really work when you comment often :p
<Cranberry_Scotch> *Trollface* Friendship is also sexy
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spectrum_Rush, good point
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'll wait then
<alexxm> friends with benifits?
<MadSurge> The_Awesomeness: stick around, we stream that too :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but yeah
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> <Kjakings> Homeschooled kids grow up to be people who want to name their kids Pinkamena and Dash
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Made me lol a lot and kind of nod… true dat hahahaha
<BoroBrony> that just leads to a relationship i been there
<AJIsAwesome> Have some waiting music. :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFFoRzLQY9Q&feature=relmfu
<Cranberry_Scotch> Well, who knows what those ponies get up to when they aren't filming
<pot80> then the only benifits you get is money
<Colt_Brovakiin> ahh, I wan't to go and make a cup of tea but my cat is asleep on my legs and I don't wanna move her ;A;
<Brad[Laptop]> <Kjakings> Homeschooled kids grow up to be people who want to name their kids Pinkamena and Dash
<Dovah> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-sU6foM5ws best song EVER
<Brad[Laptop]> what I didnt send no colours.
<Kjakings> 7I've always hated public school.
<AJIsAwesome> Brad[Laptop]: That's not entirely true. :S
<Kjakings> 7Surrounded by intellectual inferiors. Ugh. It's literally sickening at times.
<Brad[Laptop]> But I did copy and paste from another channel with a user who used colours
<Brad[Laptop]> so I guess my irc client preserved them
<Cades> I know how you feel
<Stormy`> ha
<The_Awesomeness> except if the homescooled kids have conservative mothers Brad[Laptop]
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I was in public school until the start of 9th grade.
<pot80> Dovah I'd have to dissagree there
*Stormy` slaps RedDragonX with a 4r8a9i11n13b17o26w trout
<Brad[Laptop]> The_Awesomeness That quote was in reference to me saying id name my daughter Pinkamena and my son Dash.
<Brad[Laptop]> lol
<The_Awesomeness> my cusins cant even watch youtube because its to "LIberal"
<Dovah> pot80: whatever :| killjoy
<sub06905> Waiting music :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c99tcSlBwY
<The_Awesomeness> their mother is a control freak
<Kjakings> 7what is it with you people and these trout?
<Brad[Laptop]> I was homeschooled myself.
*Stormy` slaps Kjakings with a 4r8a9i11n13b17o26w trout
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: Thank you. :D
<pot80> Dovah what its in the top 5 or so :(
<RedDragonX> thank you
<AJIsAwesome> I love this song.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> trout slap is a classic irc command.
<sub06905> :3
<Cranberry_Scotch> So, you're saying kids who are homeschooled but don't know about MLP: FiM will inevitavbly give their kids names they'venever heard?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Its a compliment.
<Stormy`> It's a good way of getting someone's attention if you don't know what to say
<Stormy`> :P
<Dovah> pot80: no i just find it amusing lol :P
<pot80> :P
<Brad[Laptop]> Cranberry_Scotch read my previous messages :P
<Colt_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: Its better then that 10 hour cantina band video you usually link :P
<Stormy`> Or when "hi" is too boring
<AJIsAwesome> :$
<RedDragonX> yeah just like when I say I hate you all with a a passion it's really a compliment
<BoroBrony> :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Hey, thats my style.
<Sonny> gtg to sleep
<Kjakings> 7Lazy people. I put effort into my interesting greetings.
<Sonny> bye :3
<AJIsAwesome> I link other stuff besides that. :P
<alexxm> bye Sonny
<AJIsAwesome> BYe, Sonny! :)
<Kjakings> 7You almost always learn something.

<Colt_Brovakiin> Goodbye Sonny :)

<Cranberry_Scotch> I don'
<Sonny> byez
<Stormy`> Like calling me a mushroom/flower/insect?
<Kjakings> 7Today is the first evidence I've seen that sometimes there's actual /research/ involved
<Cranberry_Scotch> I don't see any post disproving what I said
<thelonepony> bye Sonn- gone :(
<Stormy`> Or a prosititute?
<pot80> For the wait I guess http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUtcBQCW_zk

<Stormy`> *prostitute
<Kjakings> 7Look it was just a latin word for 'stormy' I was being lazy
<RedDragonX> I'm sure I would have
<Stormy`> Sure it was...
<RedDragonX> too busy getting blown up by creepers
*alexxm kidnaps the

<ASoftFluffyThing> alexxm, what have we told you about kidnapping other ponies?
<BladedWings> AJIsAwesome: no just the word the lol
<CountDoofus> *squee* I just improved my hat with ponies. Going to wear that at a local convention in a week and a half. Pictures to follow ;)
<Stormy`> Lol so do you look this stuff up before signing in?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so.. me being the most technically competent person I know
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> finally figured out how to pay mastercard bill on the internet.
<alexxm> ASoftFlufflyThing that it's awesome
<Kjakings> 7No I always intend to and just forget and think shit up on the spot.
<thelonepony> hmph (get the skorpion out of my mouth) :(
<ASoftFluffyThing> http://attackwithhugs.deviantart.com/#/d5hg4e0
<Stormy`> Credit card bills are a bitch
<spud363> MOAR WUBZ! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EboFwEp8wkk
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> well the problem is my mastercard is through a different bank than my usual bank
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so they make it difficult.
<Stormy`> I had one once and ended up having to pay another fee so it could process on time
<sub06905> moar music links! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epb4TWu2B64&feature=relmfu
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> BUT I did find an awesome way to launder money.
<BoroBrony> pot80 watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKazxGjieD8
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> If you go into your bank and make a cash payment on your mastercard its not reported anywhere
<Stormy`> ...good to see you haven't changed...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so you can go in and make a $5k cash payment on a mastercard and use it like normal
<taoumi||shower> some pony tell me to not play borderlands 2 and get back to work
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> over pay on it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and they dont track that.

<Kjakings> 7So, you know how there's this thing of The Avengers portraying badass versions of old fairy tales?
<taoumi> awww ok

<pot80> BoroBrony love it :P
<Kjakings> 7I want Cobie Smulders to play an adult Mathilda who uses her telekinetic powers as a superheroine. I mean it's not a fairy tale but she didn't play an Avenger.
<BaconMane> 0,52:3 is a wierd ratio
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so theres a little tip for anyone wanting to subvert the laws of their country.

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Its stupid, legally in canada you can walk around with a full out sword on your back in public, but a concealed knife is illegal.

<J_E_Smith71> They must have just done it because it was the old way when I checked this afternoon
<Mega_Milk> Ehh.....put on some pants.....

<J_E_Smith71> Like with Donkey Kong Country, on the Gamecube controller they mapped Jump to B...but the A button is used for tag actions, so you have to use X or Y to run or attack. Too much of an akward control scheme

<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm not talking about wifi battles

<Cypresswolf> Nightmare Ned game Mouse Song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq0pmg0gjg8
<Dken2021> I pretty much had to use pokesav to compete in some of the random wi-fi matchs
<Panda> ValtheJean, I have gone to a tourny that was hosted back home a couple times.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03And I played a TON of Wifi battling. Even got some battles on youtube!
<Slater> I see you guys are talking about Pokemon
<doctor_whooves127> Oken2021: what was that you said earlier white feet?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you keep changing your story panda. First it's wifi battles, now it's tournaments
<Dken2021> doctor_whooves127 the last guy, he has white feet
<Slater> Scoot-Scootaloo: Do you NU, RU, or UU battle?
<Arcane_> Slater will you play me I got my B2 going

*AJIsAwesome hugs Ponies47 back :)
<RDash5000> well, imma go play hidden source nao
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because the appropriate time to mention the tournaments would have been before mentioning wifi battles
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03From White :)
*Dken2021 returns Ponies47 hug :D
<Panda> Scoot-Scootaloo, wait. you you said you had black though.
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: White and Black 2.

<AJIsAwesome> Bye, RDash5000 :)
<Panda> ValtheJean, I said "and what not." I didnt change anything -___- I have no reason to lie.
*HoodyNinja awkwardly listens to the conversation
<Panda> Scoot-Scootaloo, I thought you had one XD
<Kinixys> RDash5000: Bye.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 uh huh
<Slater> Want to play me in OU after I finish battling with Arcane_ , Scoot-Scootaloo?
<Dken2021> seeya RDash5000
<Cypresswolf> ^_^ Nightmare Ned Adolescent Song - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tM-hmqDh5c - I loved this song
<CCCP> The roundest knight at king Arthur's round table was Sir Cumference.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it still doesn't change the fact that most use hacked pokemon. And it's safe to say any of the major winners are guaranteed to do so
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I didn't trade my pokemon from White to Black2. I'll play you maybe next week!
<CCCP> i ove puns :3
<Panda> Scoot-Scootaloo, do you dont migrate? why?
<Slater> My OU team is in White
<Kinixys> CCCP: XD
<Panda> so*
<RAWRity> ...I think we need to start punching people who say these things: http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/10/10/989981/wisconsin-lawmaker-claims-some-girls-rape-easy/?mobile=nc
<Slater> I have my RU and UU team in White 2
<HoodyNinja> CCCP: They don't love you back
<Panda> RAWRity, rape easy?
<AJIsAwesome> >Looks at URL
<CCCP> HoodyNinja :C
<AJIsAwesome> >WUT
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I mean, I could use White to battle, but I'm too busey with Black 2 :V
<Panda> XD
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03busy*
<spud363> sounds racist
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: Did you get Keldeo? :3
<Arcane_> Anypony else for battles with me and Slater?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 clearly the article is taking what he said out of context
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03eeyup~
<AJIsAwesome> YAY!
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: You going to get Genesect?
<Dken2021> is the keldeo even over?
<Yahooz> no kidding
<RAWRity> ValtheJean: they put it in exact context.
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 considering he was refering to a case where a 17 year old is accused of rape for having sex with a minor
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03AJIsAwesome: When?
<spud363> :D
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: The event's out today.
<AJIsAwesome> It's been out for a while.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03WHAT?!
<HoodyNinja> Isn't he technically a minor himself?
<Cades> hey shibaru
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: You didn't know? :O
<ValtheJean> 2,14 depends on the state
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03... do I have to go to gamestop....?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 some states draw the line at 17, others at 18
<Kinixys> Cypresswolf: I've never played Ned, but that was a good song.
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: Nope. Mystery Gift Wi-fi.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03O really? What version?
<AJIsAwesome> Gonna rock a Serebii~
<Panda> well
<Panda> this is why
<spud363> srry for laghfing i thoght he said mirror
<Panda> you dont fuck in school
<RAWRity> ValtheJean: and some at 14
<HoodyNinja> Theres a guy at our school who is 21, and has a sophomore as a girlfriend
<Panda> you get accused of rape
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: Black 2/White 2, i think.
<RAWRity> Panda: no, this is why you don't fuck somebody under the age of consent.
<spud363> i cant spell :'(
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03gonna try that!
<Yahooz> unless, of course, they consent
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no, this is why you don't post this stuff in chat, since the conversation devolves
<AJIsAwesome> DO IT!
<HoodyNinja> Yahooz: They can't
<Panda> RAWRity, I consider 17 to be a minor still. considering where I am from. I dont know the winconsin law
<RAWRity> Scoot-Scootaloo: JSYK, Genesect's broken as hell
<AJIsAwesome> Make sure you get it. :3
<HoodyNinja> ValtheJean: We were talking about pokemon :/
<RAWRity> Panda: minor? yes. Over the age of consent? also yes. South Dakota's age of consent is 14
<Yahooz> HoodyNinja: nonono, im refering to underage sex in general XP
<spud363> y are we talking about rape?
<Dken2021> that's a good question
<doctor_whooves127> ok flying ship thats weird
<RAWRity> Genesect comes with Signal Beam, Techno Blast, Solar Beam, and Magnet Bomb
<Panda> pft... RAWRity, only if that was forced, there a are 11 and 12 year olds in california that are prego -___-
<Panda> enforced*
<shibaru> Hey
<HoodyNinja> Because RAWRity is trying to poison us
<Yahooz> thats Cali for ya :p
<Panda> which is why im not there
<Yahooz> where u at now?
<Cypresswolf> Regular Show: Wrestling Rigby - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ9NJH9mM1g
<Panda> Yahooz, try paying attention sometime.
<Yahooz> okeh
<RAWRity> so, Frankenweenie flopped at the box office.
<doctor_whooves127> i have event genesect its my favorite pokemon on my team right now
<spud363> regular show is terrible show
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: It did? :D
<Cypresswolf> Yes, that is a Wrestling Buddy :)
<Dken2021> RAWRity was it that bad?
<shibaru> This may be my last time here.
<Cypresswolf> Who remembers Wrestling Buddies?
<HoodyNinja> RAWRity: I expected that, actually
<puffmuffins> i love rgular show
<puffmuffins> regular*
<AJIsAwesome> I didn't even see the appeal in it (besides the whole Tim Burton thing).
<RAWRity> On the one hand, I'm sad because I hate seeing stop motion animation failing. This alongside Paranorman and Pirates! makes it seem like stop-motion is on the way out, and I hate that.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Damn, might as well use Genosect for your main team!
<Saturn> sex is legal at 16 in the UK
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: Wait, Pirates! was a flop?
*Saturn 08,01is tired
<RAWRity> On the other hand, Tim Burton not making money is always good.
<RAWRity> AJIsAwesome: eeyup.
<Panda> Saturn, some over~
<CCCP> Saturn too old
<thelonepony> go to bread Saturn
<spud363> i was about to say its a kids show and then realised the irony
<doctor_whooves127> Scoot-Scootaloo: i know i am
*AJIsAwesome tucks Saturn :)
<AJIsAwesome> Well, that sucks.
<AJIsAwesome> I thought Pirates! would do well.
<RAWRity> Saturn: it's 16 in North Carolina as well. in Mexico it's 12
<Cades> why?
<RAWRity> AJIsAwesome: eenope, flopped hard.
<AJIsAwesome> *sigh*
*ASoftFluffyThing listens to PinkiePieSwear
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Same here. I love his music.
<RAWRity> and Paranorman's just barely made back its budget.
<HoodyNinja> RAWRity: I think one think about it is that stop motion is starting to get less appealing, and not as good as it used to be. Although I did want to see Paranorman
<Ponies47> Saturn: Go to bed mister :P
*Kinixys dumps a load of pony plushes on Saturn's bed so he can sleep.
<spud363> wrek how long are u awake?
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome my favorite song from him is The Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy featuring Makkon
<ASoftFluffyThing> It's preeeeeeeet
<VenHur> Saturn: Good night, sleepy pony.
<ASoftFluffyThing> preeeeeeeeeeeety
<CCCP> night Saturn
<spud363> u were up last night to
<thelonepony> night Saturn
<Ponies47> Nighty night Saturn :)
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: Paranorman and Pirates were both great, but for whatever reason nobody wanted to go see them.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night, Saturn
<shibaru> Cuz I have horrible chest pain
<RAWRity> And I've heard good things about Frankenweenie, but of course it also flops.
<Cades> aw :(
<Panda> well
<spud363> *sniffs out of bordom*
<Panda> its about a zombie dog
<Panda> ill just bootleg it XD
<HoodyNinja> Frankenweenie just looks dumb as hell
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: how come?
<thelonepony> http://derpibooru.org/117487
<RAWRity> Seems like a fun concept to me. Sort of a Jimmy Neutron meets Frankenstein thing.
<HoodyNinja> RAWRity: Idk, something about a kid bringing dead pets back to life, and it was a Tim Burton idea. He can do better
<thelonepony> It works :D
<Spectrum_Rush> thelonepony: dood
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: considering Burton's latest works, I'd say no, he can't.
<Kinixys> Tim Burton really likes the undead..
<shibaru> I can't do anything about it
<spud363> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AHHOTDzWuM wubz to wake u up!
<doctor_whooves127> ist tim burton a zombie?
<doctor_whooves127> isnt
<spud363> :|
<HoodyNinja> RAWRity: I have a lot of childhood memories surrounding Mr. Burton, pray tell what are his latest works, I haven't a clue
<doctor_whooves127> corpse bride right?
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: Dark Shadows, Alice in Wonderland, Planet of the Apes remake
<HoodyNinja> love it^
<Dark92Enigma> Tim Burton did some masterpieces, one of them being Batman
<HoodyNinja> damnit RAWR
<HoodyNinja> and I liked dark Shadows
<Dark92Enigma> The Nightmare before Christmas!
<HoodyNinja> But only for the Depp
<RAWRity> Burton didn't direct Nightmare
<Dark92Enigma> no?
<RAWRity> he wrote the poem the film was based on
<Dark92Enigma> hold on
<RAWRity> that's it.
<Dark92Enigma> oh
<Dark92Enigma> ''Poor Jack?''
<Karaoke> boop
<RAWRity> Burton's Made some good movie, but the 2000s has been an exercise in him giving less and less of a shit.
<HoodyNinja> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw8pcxE6U9k Sure is quiet in here
<doctor_whooves127> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/10/story-updates-october-10th-evening.html
<Kandarihu> One thing about this Nuzlocke Challenge. It doesn't exactly mention whether breeding is allowed or not.
<RAWRity> generally speaking, no
<Kinixys> I'll be back.
<Dken2021> I smell a rule exploitive
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAkg-qd1Bhk
<RAWRity> you use the pokemon you get. no breeding. no trading.
<doctor_whooves127> the heck is the nuzlocke challenge?
<Kandarihu> http://www.nuzlocke.com/challenge.php
<Panda> doctor_whooves127, oh god.... no
<RAWRity> doctor_whooves127: playing Pokemon, if a pokemon faints, you release it. You only catch the first pokemon you find in each new area.
<Dken2021> in a nutshell, it's where you give yourself a challange in pokemon
<HoodyNinja> Oh god! Old Warner Bros.
<Panda> doctor_whooves127, its when if your pokemon faint they go away froever
<brony2447> well i came at an awkward time
<brony2447> ohai bronystate, did'nt see you there
<Dken2021> allo brony2447
<Panda> brony2447
<thelonepony> hi brony2447 :)
<HoodyNinja> They all died
<Panda> :#
<HoodyNinja> We are the only ones left
<oGriofa> Hey everybrony
<thelonepony> we are still alive
<HoodyNinja> We must repopulate the interwebs with bronies
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, oGriofa :)
<brony2447> yall still watching misfis or what? my stream is messed up so i dont know
<thelonepony> hi oGriofa

<CCCP> Its almost halloween what would you dress up as?
<brony2447> im going as pinkie
<oGriofa> HoodyNinja: What?
<Kandarihu> I think that allowing breeding might make things more interesting. It could still be limited of course. But to consider Pokemon to build a family should motivate a trainer even more to protect them.
<Cypresswolf> Abby is following me - its too much cute
<brony2447> my mom actually let me :O
<thelonepony> RAWRity: :D
<HoodyNinja> CCCP: Link

<flutterloves> i like trains
<MakerDusk> but, I for one, am too lazy to write a colour script >_<
<ValtheJean> 2,14 more like I'm a slave to *it*
<Yahooz> Lol, it easy to bypass the color kickbots
<MakerDusk> so I manually set it each time
<Lyude> I used to have some awesome color scripts when I used mIRC
<Polydunami> We're all part of one mind; BronyState.
<Lyude> I wrote one to make rainbow text.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 every time I type, I'm ctrl+k'ing :P
*brony2447 gives DeadPoolDash a brownie
<Hoody|Sleepy> ValtheJean: Then we are the slaves, either way, EVERYONE IS A SLAVE

<MakerDusk> I'm actually at the point where they leave me alone when I'm sleeping because they can't tell
<Hoody|Sleepy> I fell asleep in my bed
<flutter_spin> I guess most of the rules are there. I think Scoot's rules do somewhat apply though.
<Canadian_Brony> my teacher yelled at me and scared the entire class
<MakerDusk> and hate being embarassed
<Canadian_Brony> it was hilarious
<Barbetos> Ugh.. I, with out even thinking about it, said buck instead of fuck in a game of Natural Selection 2 over com.
<[Alpha]> Sup
<brony2447> always count on the guy with autism and ADD to give you teh nutella!
<Canadian_Brony> ohai [Alpha]

<flutter_spin> No really, what fanfic?
<Polydunami|Busy> I didn't actually know who Hipster Brony is until Ghosties had his rant months ago.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Y so not srs Jaymoo
*Jmo slaps AJIsAwesome|Busy around a bit with a large trout
<Jmo> You aren't busy.
<brony2447> im playing tf2 now! wish me luck :)
<DeadpoolDash> saxy cannot be trusted
<Canadian_Brony> good luck brony2447
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Wait, care to explain who Hipster Brony is?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Never heard of him.
<Yahooz> Oh, a Ghosties rant
<Jmo> LOL
<Yahooz> those certainly are revealing
<brony2447> *gulp*
<ASoftFluffyThing> I second that, AJIsAwesome|Busy
<thelonepony> ^
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Busy read this http://www.bronystate.net/about-us/history/
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Okay.
<Polydunami|Busy> Hipster Brony is basically the founder of Bronystate.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14pretty much, Hipster Brony is one of the OG founders
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<Yahooz> Is
<Canadian_Brony> along with NewDCD
<flutter_spin> whoa! I turned invisible. Wait, shouldn't ponies still be able to hear me?
<brony2447> does it always take 10 years to open TF2?
<DeadpoolDash> how are change name
<Polydunami|Busy> Wait, is NewDCD the same as DCD?
<Yahooz> Ghosties and SilverScreen then jumped on the bandwagon
<Canadian_Brony> DeadpoolDash "/nick *instert nick*"
<Ponies47> http://ponies47.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5gtrfq <- Still my favorite of my work :3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Yep, Polydunami|Busy
<DeadpoolDash> thanks
<Canadian_Brony> np
<flutter_spin> NewDCD? Why does that sound familiar
<Polydunami|Busy> Right, just wanted to make sure of that.
<Polydunami|Busy> Hat of shoes.
<Yahooz> and now like, 2 of the original 4 are gone, one has taken a huge leap of absence
<Yahooz> its saddening to say the least
<Canadian_Brony> You guys should uptdate the site soon. kirz left the modding position recently and he's still on the mod list
<brony2447> seriously does it always tke this long to open TF2?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm still here though
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and I'm DA BESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<sub06905> :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-fRuoMIfpw
<superretroworld> brony2447: ohhh yes
<Yahooz> Well, next to Vivi ofc
<Spectrum_Rush> if NewDCD pops in chat any time in the future call him gramps, but only if Saturn is around and active
<flutter_spin> posting interesting pony-related, yet random favorite pics are still welcome, yes?
<brony2447> superretroworld: its been like.. 10 min
<Canadian_Brony> and he isn't on the "Former Staff" list at the bottom of the "History" page
<Kencolt> Call HIM Gramps?
<Yahooz> Canadian_Brony: who?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> HL2.exe does take forever
<flutter_spin> sub06905: what did I just watch?
<Yahooz> HB?
<Canadian_Brony> Yahooz kirzstryfe
<superretroworld> brony2447: if it takes that long you may need to start the task manager
<sub06905> My Brand!
<Yahooz> Canadian_Brony: idk... i dont check those pages
<Jmo> I have special eyes.
<brony2447> superretroworld: lol ok
<Yahooz> i know staff past and present regardless
<brony2447> superretroworld: but its responding fine :|
<Spectrum_Rush> Kencolt: in joke since hes the "oldest" original mod
<Yahooz> ...and potentially future...
<superretroworld> brony2447: wait i mean once you get in the game and its stuck
<Cranberry_Scotch> Out of all eight Harry Potter movies, what's your favorite?
<Canadian_Brony> Yahooz kirzstryfe is a former mod, but the pages haven't been updated since 2.0 probably
<brony2447> superretroworld: lol ok
<Kencolt> Ah. As opposed to me, the oldest semi-regular attendant.
<Yahooz> Canadian_Brony: im well aware
<superretroworld> Cranberry_Scotch: 1st or 2nd tie
<Canadian_Brony> Yahooz and Hipster_Brony is a site founder. He isn't a mod anymore either
<flutter_spin> the first one? Cranberry_Scotch
<brony2447> ok its starting up..wish me luck for real this time...
<Yahooz> Canadian_Brony: also aware
<Canadian_Brony> Yahooz then what were you asking me?
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=eJ-nAsk4UYw&feature=endscreen
<Spectrum_Rush> not really going with actual real life age here Kencolt :S
<Yahooz> Canadian_Brony: if the former staff and history pages ACTUALLY have been updated
<Kencolt> I wish I weren't. I may have to get dentures soon. SIgh...
<flutter_spin> wait a second Canadian_Brony ... you are just posting them in order as you finish watching each one
<Yahooz> no need for a history lesson dude, ive been on this site AT LEAST twice as long as you have
<Canadian_Brony> Yahooz as far as I know, not since Bronystate 2.0
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin well DUH
<flutter_spin> lol
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Testing.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Nvm.
<Canadian_Brony> it's either Whose Line or Omegle, and the second is difficult in another chat.
<flutter_spin> lol
<superretroworld> night everypony
<Canadian_Brony> g'night superr
<Canadian_Brony> dah
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night, superretroworld. :)
<Polydunami> Good night, superretroworld
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night, superretroworld
<sub06905> night superretroworld
<thelonepony> night super- gone :(
<Cranberry_Scotch> Do you think Discord is conscious, or at the very least, aware, while he is trapped in his stone prison?
<sub06905> probably
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I think so.
<flutter_spin> Oh no, not the Fringe goo debate all over again
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Fringe Goo?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> http://youtu.be/oSHbIVUCjZY
<Cranberry_Scotch> It might explain why Discord toned down his chaos a bit after being freed
<flutter_spin> Fringe introduced a special goo that froze the temporal.... let's just say it froze people and they hate doing it because they are still conscious every second
<Canadian_Brony> Cranberry_Scotch yes, but only for a short time. I'm putting a similar hypothesis in one of my fanfics I'm writing.
<DerpyMuffins> Still no stream?
<Canadian_Brony> nnope
<Canadian_Brony> and hi
<flutter_spin> DERPY
<Polydunami> Toned down? He still made everything bloody chaotic
<flutter_spin> Well there's another name I missed.
<Cranberry_Scotch> But there are levels to chaos.
<Canadian_Brony> such as ordered chaos
<flutter_spin> bloody? no
<Canadian_Brony> AKA Bronystate
<DerpyMuffins> Are really really having one of those long disccusions?
<Yahooz> >ordered
<Yahooz> PULEASE
<Polydunami> What discussion?
<Canadian_Brony> dunno
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=Dz5Jeme5EMQ&feature=endscreen
<flutter_spin> lol, stop that!
<flutter_spin> Urge to click irresistable
<Canadian_Brony> you don't like Whose Line? :'(
*sub06905 has never see whose line
<Canadian_Brony> then click that link
<Canadian_Brony> and watch it
<flutter_spin> I like Whose Line. I just... wish to have someone there to laugh with me
<Polydunami> Well, you have opportunities all over the place, sub06905 :3
<flutter_spin> Great. Now I'm getting all depressed and sentimental again
<Canadian_Brony> it's only one skit, but that's all I post at a time
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin this is why it needs to be streamed
<RAWRity> bonjour
<Canadian_Brony> hi RAWRity
<Polydunami> Aloha, RAWRity :P
<RAWRity> So, just finished the Storyline for B/W 2. Kinda half-and-half on it.
<flutter_spin> Been far too long since I've done anything with any of my friends/family
<RAWRity> I liked some parts, disliked others.
<RaveBrony> Bed time... Good night, everyone!
<Canadian_Brony> g'night RaveBrony
<Polydunami> Good night, RaveBrony
<taoumi> you ever have those moments when it's 2am you are tyrign to get to sleep and you let the dog sleep in your room so it will not bark, and you say to the dog. "can you get yourself off more quitely. i'm trying to sleep here."
<thelonepony> night RaveBrony :)

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> NIght, RaveBrony! :)
<flutterloves> no stream?
<flutter_spin> uh, no
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ALSO, NO SPOILERS! ;3;
<flutter_spin> and no stream.
<flutter_spin> I'm hoping a special pegasus mod would stream
<Canadian_Brony> taoumi no, because I only have fish as pets, and they're upstairs.
<flutterloves> :O
<RAWRity> I'm not gonna spoil anything, But I will say that I think I liked B/W's plot better overall.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Okay.
<flutter_spin> Trying to figure out what B/W is
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin who would that be?
<taoumi> well fish have this nasty knack for dieing if you are nto to ocarefull. i'm nto terible caeful
<Polydunami> Is this some kind of fic?
<flutterloves> b[xdf;hbdt\g;j
<taoumi> Canadian_Brony:
<thelonepony> I want to get B/W now ;3;
<RAWRity> I liked the gameplay overworld stuff, plus the minigames and side-stuff, and overall the plot's good.
<flutterloves> ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

<flutterchu> phase4: http://th01.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2012/164/4/f/the_living_tombstone_by_lazypixel-d53f64p.png
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> lame I thought it was an actual pony rap battle
<RAWRity> Gameplay wise, B/W 2 is better and has more to offer. Story wise, B/W had a better structured plot and a more satisfying payoff.
<taoumi> nighty DerpyM...gone
<Jmo> oh Pokemon
<flutter_spin> Must figure out what B/W stands for
<Jmo> Black/White
<Polydunami> Right, Pokemon
<RAWRity> Still, not a bad game, and I haven't even beat the E4 yet, and I get to see who the new champion is. So that's fun.
<RAWRity> oh, and this happened: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/299348_3593352602726_1137833944_n.jpg
<Canadian_Brony> RAWRity :D I'm going to try that
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :D
<Canadian_Brony> it's all presedential shit!
<Canadian_Brony> seriously, try it for yourself! you will get identical results
<Polydunami> More like similar :P
<RAWRity> That occured after Romney went on record saying he was "completely wrong" about the 47% remark from a few weeks ago. But well, this is more funny.
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami whatev
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwRmYi-sWxU&feature=endscreen&NR=1
<Kandarihu> Uh, RAWRity, do you have a source on that?
<Polydunami> Okay, that's one of the most memorable skits, Canadian_Brony :D
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami glad you love it
<ASoftFluffyThing> Anyone know how to cope through a 12-hour fast of no food except for water and medicine (if needed)?
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/10/tech/web/google-romney-completely-wrong/index.html
<thelonepony> i had couple of times ASoftFluffyThing
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ASoftFluffyThing: Try to preserve as much energy as you can.
<thelonepony> are you able to chew gum?
<ASoftFluffyThing> thelonepony, can't eat anything. At. All.
<Kandarihu> I smell a Google-bombing on that
<Jmo> Run around screaming.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ASoftFluffyThing: Also, the mind is stronger than the body. Don't forget that.
<ASoftFluffyThing> It's hour 3
*Jmo slaps AJIsAwesome|Busy around a bit with a large trout
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I guess you could try sleeping a lot?
<Jmo> You lai
<thelonepony> i said chew, not swallo
<ASoftFluffyThing> I can't chew gum because then I'd forget and swallow it.
<Cranberry_Scotch> To the properly motivated, a 12-hour fast is nothing
<thelonepony> oh, well that sucks
<flutterloves> lol duck.jpg
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ASoftFluffyThing: Also, try meditation. It will probably take your mind off the fasting.
<RAWRity> so yeah, that was your daily dose of political humor
<thelonepony> ^
<RAWRity> now back to your regularly scheduled memes: http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/s480x480/60232_321871974577400_1028857360_n.jpg

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> lol Jeemoo

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Cranberry_Scotch: WHich is why I suggested it.
<Jmo> lol Ayejay
<ASoftFluffyThing> If you're wondering why I'm asking, I have to go to the hospital on base to get some labs done to make sure I don't have PCOS
<Ryunosuke> nothing really works if you dont know how to do it :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I'm not sure if she knows how to.
<Polydunami> PCOS?
<thelonepony> ^
<Jmo> Ah
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Lol geemoo
<Ryunosuke> meditation is actually quite easy... if you do know how to do it
<Canadian_Brony> I tried once
<ASoftFluffyThing> And I can't have anything to eat or drink for 12 hours prior to the lab
<Kandarihu> ASoftFluffyThing, if it's not a spiritual thing, then it's just a matter of keeping your mind off of it.
<Kandarihu> Do you have Steam?
<RAWRity> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3r7tx6/
<Canadian_Brony> I can't sit still long enough
<Ryunosuke> here's a trick
<Ryunosuke> 1
<Ryunosuke> :)
<thelonepony> RAWRity: :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I've tried it many times. I end up falling asleep, unfortunately.
<Kandarihu> ASoftFluffyThing, do you have a Steam account?
*Jmo slaps AJIsAwesome|Busy around a bit with a large trout
<Eddmario> So, today's the 2nd anniversary of FIM...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *asleep most of the time

<Cranberry_Scotch> Let me guess AJ, the rest of the time you don't relax enough
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kandarihu, yes I do but since I'm on my Acer it's kinda pointless to get on it since I can't play any games till I get a new USB port
