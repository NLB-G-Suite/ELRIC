<Ghosties> 04But you know...
<otakon> fluttercry: I have to work 3 to 9
<Ghosties> 04There's also...always Friday
<Ghosties> 04Yesterday was Thursday, Thursday
<otakon> I have to work 5 to 9 tomorrow
<fluttercry> 05,15Yesterday was Thursday Thurdsay
<Ghosties> 04Taday it is Friday
<Sceptileknight> so when is brony movie night?
<djblazekin> been trying to get my mlg pro citrcut xb360 controller to work well with duke nukem 3d atomic edition
<otakon> my boss KNEW I WANTED to have Friday night and Saturday morning off
<Ghosties> 04Tomorrow is Saturday, and Sunday afterwards...
<fluttercry> 05,15otakon that sucks
<AJIsAwesome> I'll be out of town for Christmas week at a place that probably doesn't have good wi-fi, so I might not be here. :<
<otakon> Sceptileknight: tomorrow, 7 pm EST
<Ghosties> 04I don't want this weekend to eeeeeeeeeeEEEEEEEND
<DashWithRainbows> Sceptileknight Friday night, 7pm EST.
<DashWithRainbows> EMN is 7pm GMT I think.
<DashWithRainbows> On Saturday^
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm trying to figure out how to strafe in Duke Nukem 3D. If the arrows turn me, and the ctrl button shoots.....how do I move side to side
<Sceptileknight> ok thanks
<fluttercry> 05,15you can't play any 90s fps without circle strafing
<Sceptileknight> Anyone play portal 2?
<Ghosties> 04Strafing's real easy! Ya just step to the side :D
<DocSane> fluttercry: Is it not set up to use WASD as the controls?
<Ghosties> 04Silly flutter
<thelonepony> Sceptileknight: i wish i had it
<fluttercry> 05,15well yeah, but how do you move sideways!
<fluttercry> 05,15the arrows turn you!
<Barbetos|AtWork> fluttercry: they release the source code for duke 3d a while back, if you want strafing look up one of the custom engines made for it.
<djblazekin> is there virtical aim on the pc version or is it only on the console version
<Ghosties> 04Step to the side, silly goose :3
<Kandarihu> Fl00t4sh41, A or D
<fluttercry> 05,15djblazekin I think that's just the console version
<fluttercry> 05,15DocSane WASD is relatively new. FPS used to use arrows
<fluttercry> 05,15and no mouse
<Barbetos|AtWork> fluttercry: http://eduke32.com/
<Kandarihu> Oh, sorry.
<DocSane> fluttercry: Can't you just open the options menu and see what strafe is set for?
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: What are you sorry for? :)
<Sceptileknight> :(
<DocSane> I am making a second attempt at makign a bean loaf tonight.
<AJIsAwesome> DocSane: Best of luck! :)
<djblazekin> you have to goe into setup
<Kandarihu> AJIsAwesome, giving fluttercry basic instructions for a game that DN3D predates.
<Sceptileknight> And minecraft?
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Ah, I see.
<Ghosties> 04Oh Richard Cheese, y u so gud
<DocSane> The first attempt is edible, but not very flavorful. Also, the texture left something to be desired.
<AJIsAwesome> Ghosties: Becuase his last name is Cheese?
<[]DeadpoolDash> sometimes strafe in those games is 'Q' and 'E' or even pressing another button in addition to 'A' and 'D'
<DocSane> I've added in celery and mushroom to this one. First attempt just used carrots and onions.
<Ghosties> 04His cover of Black's Friday is great, and his cover of Just Like Heaven is even better
<Sceptileknight> thelonepony: thats bad
<djblazekin> there is now a hello kitty build a bear and chia pet
<DocSane> Also may mix in some gorgonzola for extra flavor.
<thelonepony> Sceptileknight: i know, i do love puzzles, but yeah
<Sceptileknight> how can i send a message to someone???
<AJIsAwesome> Sceptileknight: Type part of their name and push tab. :)
<AJIsAwesome> It should autocomplete.
<Sceptileknight> thelonepony: thanks
<twilight_sprinkle> i think he means private message
<killerpony7733> Sceptileknight Pm or just ping?
<AJIsAwesome> Oh.....
<fluttercry> 05,15What if MLP is really part of a communist party to turn the youth of America docile so that they could invade?
<AJIsAwesome> Then disreagrd what I said. :$
<thelonepony> Sceptileknight: it was ayejay, not me
<thelonepony> sillieh you
<Ghosties> 04WHAT IF

<otakon> PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE HUGE BEAR EATING FROM THE REMAINS
<CCharmanderK> Sumica, your townspeople are retards.

<CrystalPhoenix> Derpy adorable stomping on bubble wrap
<CrystalPhoenix> adorably**
<CrystalPhoenix> wait....
<CrystalPhoenix> BUBBLE WRAP
<otakon> Sumica: Far Cry 3?
<CCharmanderK> So, no chance of you streaming a playthrough of Duke Nukem 3D or Quake II?
<otakon> O_o
<otakon> Sumica: it's GOOOOOOOOOOD
<CrystalPhoenix> Derpy....bubble cutie mark....bubble wrap....delivery service
<otakon> Sumica: seriously even Yahtzee likes it, I have it and it's quite huge and awesome and open ended
<CrystalPhoenix> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH how come I haven't seen this
<djblazekin> where is the fluttershy yay comming frome
<AJIsAwesome> CrystalPhoenix: You just realized it now? .__.
<CrystalPhoenix> well I just got bubble wrap in mind just now
<otakon> Sumica: has NOTHING to do with the first two games, in name only sequel
<CrystalPhoenix> and didn't bother about anything around Derpy really
<CCharmanderK> XD Your cat sounds a lot like my cat, Sumica.
<CrystalPhoenix> I still want to see Derpy adorably squishing bubble wrap
<otakon> Sumica: yeah I know, but basically Far Cry franchise = HUGE open world shooter with lot's of freedom on how to approach the enemies
<CCharmanderK> I'm gonna play Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic now. Later.
<otakon> have fun CC..gone
<djblazekin> is the gameloft mlp game any good
<otakon> it's okay
<Nittany_Tiger> It's fun for a while.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<jcelios> djblazekin: no.
<otakon> but it has a LOT of timed based minigames
<otakon> but the graphics are fitting with the show as is the music
<AJIsAwesome> I have patience with games like those, but when I realized that beating the game without purchasing anything without money takes MUCH longer than I realized.
<jcelios> it's just one of those stupid iOS games that tries it's hardest to manipulate you into microtransactions
<otakon> aji: oh yeah
<otakon> ahe AJIsAwesome oh yeah
<djblazekin> i just took a shot of red wine now i'm feeling dizzy

<Azuredragon> You should eat a Hotdog
<twilight_sprinkle> take a bite of my hot chiwawa meat!
<PonyNegZero> don't text and drive kids
<BroPony|MEDIC> ok i was going to ask
<BroPony|MEDIC> does anypony here run PCSX2
<jcelios> wat iz dat
<RainbowPengy> i did once
<Azuredragon> If you blow up that truck it drops alot of money
<Haku1013> neyh
<Haku1013> nyeh
<BroPony|MEDIC> Its a PS2 emulator, i need some help with it
<jcelios> o interesting
<RainbowPengy> sure i can try to help
<thelonepony|BL2> Hi Haku1013 :)
<thelonepony|BL2> Hi BroPony|MEDIC :)
<BroPony|MEDIC> ok, the only thing i need help with is when i play certain games they have this slow motion effect to it, is there anyway to fix that
<jcelios> didn't know they had PS2 emulators that were usable
<SkunkTauri> hi everypony
<BroPony|MEDIC> hi SkunkTauri
<Polydunami> Hey there, SkunkTauri
<Azuredragon> Too bad you don't have grenades yet. makes it easy
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, SkunkTauri. :)
<RainbowPengy> mhm the only thing i can think of is that pcsx2 sucks and its incomplete for most part and lags alot
<SkunkTauri> did i miss Andrea
<otakon> lol
<Azuredragon> lol:D
<PonyNegZero> Pinkie Pie!
<BroPony|MEDIC> RainbowPengy: its not that bad, it only lags on games that have a higher quality resolution
<AJIsAwesome> SkunkTauri: She's not here until Saturday. :)
<SkunkTauri> ok :)
<RainbowPengy> lol those where prime example of good cops
<PonyNegZero> that truck is Pinkie Pie - it is bouncy as all heck and it breaks physics
<PonyBean> run people over! D:
<jcelios> On a console like the PS2 I thought all games were ment to run at the same res
<RainbowPengy> like i said pcsx2 is incomplete and as flaw
<BroPony|MEDIC> jcelios: as the ps2 got older the games became more sophisticated and so did the graphics
<RainbowPengy> the wii emulator run better on the same spec pc
<RainbowPengy> then pcsx2
<Azuredragon> AWWW YEAH
<Azuredragon> Glitch time!
<magmablock> Stream froze for me
<BroPony|MEDIC> O_O Did that truck just....
<RainbowPengy> yea it did
<PonyNegZero> see, pinkie pie, right there
<BroPony|MEDIC> no i must be crazy
<RainbowPengy> xD
<jcelios> BroPony|MEDIC: ah yeah that makes sense
<SkunkTauri> you can launch cars far with that swing
<RainbowPengy> just paint it pink and get some cotton candy on top
<otakon> it just wants to play in the sandbox

<Shizuka> 13my torrent has one of the SA multiplayer mods, never tried it though
<Reikim> http://i.imgur.com/HtpZs.jpg
<SirGanjalf> like Katana or Golf Club... or dildo
<Kandarihu> San Andreas now? Time to add another big game on my wishlist.
<Shizuka> 13torrent is a few years old though so dunno if it's still tracked
<Shizuka> 13i know it's on steam :P
<Reikim> Got it before otakon this time.
<otakon> SO why hasn't Rockstar made a GTAHD collection yet?
<Shizuka> 13has just been out of my price range every time ><
<TheMostWanted> Katana is a good weapon for zombies
<DerpyWhooves> Hello.
<wipergone2> Shizuka: wht do u mean tracked
<otakon> seriously people would buy it up
<TheMostWanted> Just look at walking dead
<texasboykc09> ride the rollercoaster
<otakon> GTAIII, GTA: VC and GTA: SA
<otakon> they would BUY IT ALL
<Shizuka> 13torrents are managed by trackers, servers that keep notes of who the peers are in the swarm
<DerpyWhooves> WHAAAT
<SirGanjalf> Wait for Christmas Steam Sale. It would probably be sold cheaper with ALL GTAs
<DerpyWhooves> ^^
<otakon> probs
<wipergone2> Shizuka: u downloading red orcitrea 2?
<Shizuka> 13things are mostly moving towards distributed hash tables now where the peers in the swarm *are* the tracker, but trackers are still used to handle the initial setups
<otakon> anyway off to play a bit of TL2
<Haku1013> nyeh
<djblazekin> i have a feeling that the gta stories kinda resemble scarface a small bit
<DerpyWhooves> TL2?
<texasboykc09> ^
<Shizuka> 13maybe i just miss the cautious optimism of 1992...
<Reikim> Torchlight II.
<Reikim> Which is fun.
<Shizuka> 13there's a BTTF mod for 4 too
<Shizuka> 13i assume there was an SA one too
<ouo> http://e621.net/data/35/9a/359a5440a035b13412538671988d57b4.png?1319482648
<wipergone2> Shizuka: u downloading red orchestra 2?
<Shizuka> 13anyway just want to say again that i love logistics pipes <3
<Shizuka> 13wipergone2: ..no why?
<djblazekin> better music on vc
<wipergone2> Shizuka: its free
<Shizuka> 13much fun <3
<Shizuka> 13setting up a warehouse under my manor
<DerpyWhooves> ouo: That image makes no sense.
<Kandarihu> I've been saving up for the Christmas sale for a long time. But I might not get to use it.
<Haku1013> hmm?
<Shizuka> 13hopefully, everything comes in one pipe, ores go off to be processed and then i can request items from anywhere through ender pouches <3
<Reikim> Oh I forgot Steam runs a Christmas sale. Better go lock up my wallet again.
<LunaRoyalGuard> nite bronystate and Sumica
<DerpyWhooves> WHAT IS THIS, I DON'T EVEN.
<Shizuka> 13vroom
<Kandarihu> Reikim, I hear that it's supposed to start on the 20th.
<Shizuka> 13minecraft boats need to not suck though.. lots of nice rivers i can't use because boats are crap
<Haku1013> Americas next hooker?
<DerpyWhooves> ^
<djblazekin> black ops declassified has problems with ffa matches
<DerpyWhooves> Shizuka:
<Shizuka> 13also GTA4 talk stations aren't as good as WCTR was
<SirGanjalf> Haku1013: America's next TOP hooker
<haseo348> ...whats streamin?

<DerpyWhooves> SirGanjalf: <
<Haku1013> point is...?
<texasboykc09> haseo348: gta
<Shizuka> 13i... really don't know how rastas can understand each other
<SirGanjalf> If you can't understand Jacob, then... welp
<CriticKitten> They are SO stereotypical.
<Reikim> Magic.
<DerpyWhooves> "BrStUStreamMain"
<Reikim> Science.
<Hugs|Dishes> I don't know, eithe

<Shizuka> 13it's not even a different language, it's english mangled beyond recognition
<haseo348> AND OMG SOMEONE IS TALKING
<Reikim> Pick one, depending on which universe you're in.
<SirGanjalf> ...right.
<haseo348> OMG THERES THAT VOICE AGAIN!!
<texasboykc09> haseo348: i think the latest one, ask Sumica
<Azuredragon> The subs don't even help
<SirGanjalf> dat translation:D It's like Hot Fuzz all over again
<Shizuka> 13SLOW DOWN, ARTICULATE
<haseo348> Sumica: what gta is this?
<CriticKitten> ....Rasta is to English as Tolkien orcs are to elves. >_>
<pony_8561> ...I have no idea what happened, but I'm assuming Nico needs to get something
<Kandarihu> I've been eating REALLY cheaply for 3 weeks. It saves me about $10 a week. But it's a bit of a complicated matter. My mom's bugging me to buy Madsurge a copy of Half-Minute Hero since he gifted it to me for my birthday.
<haseo348> ok:D
<CriticKitten> He always needs to go somewhere and get something.
<CriticKitten> LOL
<Shizuka> 13eeeeee <3
<Shizuka> 13now i have two ender pouches on hot bar
<Kandarihu> I'm being a cheapskate and waiting for it to go 75% off, as I'd wait for anything else to be that low.
<CriticKitten> Right in front of the cop, Sumi? XD
<Saturn> 08,01it's my birthday in 4 months
<Shammy> yay!
<Shizuka> 13one pouch takes stuff and puts it into the warehouse
<haseo348> stealin cars like a bosss
<Shizuka> 13the other requests <3
<pony_8561> because why not? XD
<Shizuka> 13i will never be able to use vanilla again
<texasboykc09> Sumica: car jacking in front of a cop:D
<CriticKitten> OW

<Shammy> best pre-birthday ever Saturn?
<Hanako> cool
*Bronysith nuzzles Saturn
<Kandarihu> Uh, why is he pulling a gun on the burger guy?
*Hanako has been playing that one again, oddly enough
<weylin|Blarg> Because he spat in his food
<CriticKitten> XD
<CriticKitten> Okay, as horrible as that was, I still laughed.
<haseo348> Sumica: cans you crash into a tree?
<Kinixys> Kandarihu: Cheapskate is such a strong word... Can't trade steam games. Paying full price is like a luxery.
<CriticKitten> haseo348: What tree? You mean Fluttershy?
<texasboykc09> Sumica: stop for the lights
<haseo348> no a tree in the game
<Kandarihu> Kinixys, I meant as in gifting it to him.
<CriticKitten> ....
<ouo> http://www.fimfiction-static.net/images/story_images/48261.png?1347678678
<pony_8561> ...he would xD
<CriticKitten> Gettin' ballsy, Sumi?
<Kinixys> Kandarihu: Right.
*CriticKitten snickers
<CriticKitten> I love how you're doing this in broad daylight right outside their station and not a single fuck is being given by ANYONE
<weylin|Blarg> Because the cops are too stupid
<AppleBloom> when is the new gta suppose to come out?

<Hugs|Dishes> Goddamit Roman. I'm fucking busy
<TheGentleManBrony> So is this before or after Niko kills Vlad?
<Reikim> And then nothing sexual happened at all. The end.
<Kandarihu> TheGentleManBrony, after
<pony_8561> This is why you turn off your cell phone on stealth missions
<Bronysith> Reikim: WROOOOOOOOOONG
<CriticKitten> Roman has fucking nothing to do with his time, does he?
<Reikim> It's sad when you can't use sarcasm anymore.
<Reikim> Anyway, Time to sleep now. Had to happen eventually.
<Reikim> Enjoy your stream.
<Hugs|Dishes> Night, Reikim

<SirGanjalf> No Country For Old Dealers
<Hanako> Little Jacob is best
<weylin|Blarg> CriticKitten: inb4 SHUT IT ROMAN!
<TheGentleManBrony> This mission needs Slenderman
<NocturnalBlade> he walkin up with a shotgun in hand and no one gives a fuck :D

<Hanako> badman is cool, but Jacob is better
<SirGanjalf> Badman - LC's Batman
<weylin|Blarg> Walk around with a gun drawn. No one cares. AMERICA!
<TheGentleManBrony> Badman. Such a stereotypical Jamaican name
<CriticKitten> Can't imagine why.
<Kandarihu> I heard that there's a way to go through the whole story being forced to kill only two people from beginning to end.
<Hanako> um
<CriticKitten> I mean, not like they just heard a firefight upstairs.... :P
<Hanako> no
<Hanako> There are more kills than that
<Hanako> that you must do
<CriticKitten> ....
<CriticKitten> Nicolas Cage?
<SirGanjalf> :D
<Hugs|Dishes> Are you sure he's not taking one?
<pony_7777> but if niko dosen't kill them, they'll DIE.
<CriticKitten> LOL
<Kandarihu> Hanako, I'm pretty sure there are multiple paths in the game. Sumica obviously isn't taking the almost-pacifist run.
<Bronysith> niko is best russian
<Barbetos> AHHHHH
<CriticKitten> She gets out of her car to beat you up like she's some badass.
<ouo> can i play gta... while i playing gta http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/266/460/7d5.png
<Hanako> Kandarihu: Yeah, but there are more *required* kills

<Hanako> the game pulls you toward the nearest solid object
<CriticKitten> The cops in this town are worse than incompetent. Even *I* can hit a guy at that range.
<SirGanjalf> Saturn: My pal got a t-shirt with that pic
<texasboykc09> Sumica: COPS ALL OVER THE PLACE
<weylin|Blarg> The cops are more drunk and high than they were!
<Hanako> CriticKitten: NYC cops are issued guns with ridiculously bad triggers and they are not taught to shoot outside of academy
<pony_7777> hey, jacob stoped smoking
<pony_8561> anyone thats sober could shoot at that range, that was just sad.
<Hanako> most of them barely qualify
<SirGanjalf> bombacloth
<CriticKitten> Hanako: Even NYC cops can hit the broad side of a barn, though.
<Hanako> not really
<SirGanjalf> and no, i have no idea what does that mean
<CriticKitten> That guy literally missed from 2 yards away
<Barbetos> The cops "He got his friend home! We have to leave him alone.
<Hanako> did you hear earlier about how they shot all those innocents
<Barbetos> "No rookie. Its da rules!"
<CriticKitten> I did, but they still hit the perp.
<Hanako> eventually
<weylin|Blarg> lol
<CriticKitten> And the fact that they hit people at all means that they still are better than these guys.
<Barbetos> Sumi you could turn on sleep mode or whatever. It stops the calls from friends and gf
<Barbetos> If only rl was like that
<Hanako> gfs

<SirGanjalf> "Sorry mister, but we just can't do anything in this case"
<weylin|Blarg> Wow, the cops just PIT everyone BUT the player. my god, they really suck XD
<Soulless_DCLXVI> No, PayNSpray takes it, but it can't do much
<Hugs|Dishes> I think it would still look like ass
<texasboykc09> Sumica: maybe
<twilight_sprinkle> it would be coated with a new layer of ass
<Soulless_DCLXVI> "The best I can do with a wreck like this"

<Kipkat07_USAF> Sumica: Go on the site list and just browse through randoms and eventually youll get a little girl pageant site. You get instant 5 star wanted
<oni_link> >mfw prostitution on BS XD

<Ryunosuke> Kipkat07_USAF: you'd be surprised
<twilight_sprinkle> lol oni_link
<Kipkat07_USAF> true
<Kipkat07_USAF> But you know what doesnt exist
<Kipkat07_USAF> a moderate conservative
<Ryunosuke> actually
<Alchemist> a round square
<Ryunosuke> i have to challenge that
<soulero> ksoz Saturn hun, but you know, call me
<oni_link> hahaha
<Saturn> 08,01my political stance: jellybeans
<oni_link> why not sandvich?
<weylin|Blarg> Jellybeans solve everything
<Kipkat07_USAF> So southern schools teach football and sex
<Kipkat07_USAF> seems legit
<oni_link> lmao
<soulero> jellybeans: better than ukip
<Alchemist> Saturn: may I ask if you have to pay tuition and if you do how much?
<oni_link> dem stereotypes
<Saturn> 08,01Kipkat07_USAF: don't they teach sex wrong?
<sub06905> would like to see how teal and orange text looks like sumi
<Ryunosuke> at least a moderate conservative isnt as right leaning as say... those Tea Party nutjobs :)
<oni_link> hahaha dat scumbag extinguisher
<Kipkat07_USAF> My political views: EXTREME far left socialist liberal commie
<oni_link> I mean hydrant
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: i don't pay tuition for university, because i'm scottish and going to a scottish university
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Saturn lol sounds like something Colbert or Stuart would say :D *MIMITW* I dont always watch the news but when i do,its Stuart and Colbert.Stay political my friends :D
<oni_link> Saturn: because scottish?
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: because the SNP are secretly awesome
<Alchemist> Saturn: so Scotland has free university education for locals?
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: eeyup
<Ryunosuke> saturn lives in a commie state
<RainbowPengy> you know this radio station sounds like fox news idk why xD
<Saturn> 08,01free for scottish, welsh, northern irish, and anyone from the EU
<Ryunosuke> j/k ;)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> wow US can learn a thing or two from ya Saturn :D
<soulero> so Saturn, whats your feeling on scotland being independant from the rest of britain?
<Saturn> 08,01Ryunosuke: you say commie, i say progressive
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Insurance? lol
<Saturn> 08,01not from england, though
<Alchemist> Saturn: I just wanted to ask because its a big issue here now. Gov suddenly introduced tuition and the students are protesting.
<Kipkat07_USAF> My political views: Extreme Far Left Socialist Liberal Communist
<oni_link> Progressiveness is cool with me
<Saturn> 08,01if you're from england, you need to pay £9000/year for my uni
<Ryunosuke> well... I think socialist programs are not a bad thing tbh
<Ryunosuke> look at most of europe
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: where's that?
<Alchemist> Saturn: Hungary
<Saturn> 08,01socialist != communism
<a_snake> Scotland voted for independence?
<soulero> think your better than us eh? yeah? think that you should be your freaking country huh? us english, welsh and irish not good enough for you Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01also, socialism is awesome
<Ryunosuke> Saturn: i know that
<Saturn> 08,01a_snake: we're voting in 2014
<Saturn> 08,01i'm voting no, because scottish independence is ridiculous
<a_snake> Ah, I thought it was taking place this year.
<Ryunosuke> however... here, we have dumbass redneck hicks who make foreign policy that does not know the difference
<Saturn> 08,01we wouldn't be part of the EU anymore; we'd have to re-apply
<oni_link> Not gonna lie, I eventually want to live in a different country, I was thinking UK or Japan
<Ryunosuke> and that is dangerous at best
<soulero> good man Saturn
<Kipkat07_USAF> involuntary euthanasia. NO,
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Saturn: wish we had that in the US :S not these dumbass political parties that want the rich to live better than the mid/lower class such as me
<sub06905> one way to solve world hunger
<Saturn> 08,01oni_link: come live in scotland
<sub06905> :D
<Kipkat07_USAF> Sumica: browse sites randomly
<Kipkat07_USAF> do eet
<a_snake> go to little lacy's surprise pageant!
<Saturn> 08,01sub06905: one way to solve world hunger is to eat the chinese and indians
<oni_link> Saturn: you're putting up some pretty good points
<a_snake> best GTAIV site ;)
<oni_link> its an option now
<sub06905> Saturn: :D

<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: gta talk radio XD
<RainbowPengy> aka the video game version of fox news
<Saturn> 08,01seriously, india has over a billion people
<Kipkat07_USAF> RainbowPengy: More like NPR
<a_snake> PLR is the liberal news radio
<Saturn> 08,01that's just fucked up
<a_snake> WKTT is the fox news radio
<Saturn> 08,01it's not even all that big a place
<oni_link> a_snake: also you'd be hungry in a half hour
<oni_link> XD
<Saturn> 08,01we need a mandatory IQ test
<Saturn> 08,01if you get below a certain amount, you're made into soup
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: lol i know but it kiinda took a turn to wtf when a chick is getting spanked while another guy wants to talk about Global Warming and his T shirt :D
<a_snake> >steal car in front of cop, cop worried about car in middle of the road
<Kipkat07_USAF> Saturn: I want to agree but morally I cant...
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I thought it was a kid? XD
<weylin|Blarg> alright, I'm off to bed. g'night everyone
<oni_link> nighty night weylin|Blarg
<soulero> bye bye weylin|Blarg
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: oh god you may be right 0_o
<oni_link> I knew it!
<sub06905> it was a kid
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Sumica oh :D
<soulero> I wish we british didnt have the conservatives in
<oni_link> lol y u steal blista compacts??
<Kipkat07_USAF> Is anyone a conservative here?
<RainbowPengy> guy with a shotgun in the middle of the street, police pass by without caring
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol biker just rides by casually past uy w/ shotgun :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> *guy
<SirGanjalf> Blista Compact is a fun little car
<soulero> Kipkat07_USAF: I dont think so, im pretty sure most people on the chat have an IQ above 50
<Kipkat07_USAF> soulero: XD
<RainbowPengy> 50 is pretty lol so yea
<soulero> old lady casually dropping her umbrella
<RainbowPengy> low*
<oni_link> I like having fun with the muscle cars, theyre good for drifting and burning out
<oni_link> awww yeah
<pony_7777> Kipkat07_USAF: unaffiliated, but lean liberal
<SirGanjalf> Goes to bed. Puts shades on.
<Kipkat07_USAF> if H2O is water, what is H2O4
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: lol inb4 csi moment :D
<pony_7777> H2SO4 is sulfuric acid
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: its unavoidable XD
<Kipkat07_USAF> I actually thought for a little while I was a *shudder* conservative
<sub06905> >come alone
<soulero> personally I dont fully like any of the major parties, but the less shitty shit is lib dems, so I guess I support them
<oni_link> Little Jacob is a bro
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: lol ikr saw a really funny one of Dead Rising 2 w/ that :D
<Kipkat07_USAF> pony_7777: what is H2O4 I asked
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: lol how did it go?
<pony_7777> di-hydrogen Quad-oxide
<sub06905> the power of google?
<sub06905> :I
<pony_7777> thought you mistyped
<Alchemist> quad=tetra
<twilight_sprinkle> thats not really something that requires google
<soulero> billy was a chemists son but now he is no more, what he thought was h2o was h2so4
<Kipkat07_USAF> H2O is 4 drinking swimming bathing etc
<twilight_sprinkle> its just duo, tetra,quad,quant affixes
<sub06905> drill em both
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oni_link: it was the boss fight w/ a security guard who fell onto a saw table and Chuck wearing a SWAT suit w/ shades says "Never saw that one coming..." then cuts away to the YEEAAHH :D
<soulero> h204 is actually a rare molecule called hydrogen superoxidizr, when at extreme temperatures it decays very quickly
<oni_link> Sketch_Toku_Brony: hahaaha
<SirGanjalf> It's a TRAP!
<RainbowPengy> completely not a trap lol
<Kipkat07_USAF> OH. SHIT.
<sub06905> vat a twist
<soulero> THE PLOT THICKENS!
<twilight_sprinkle> theyre terrible at traps
<pony_7777> love this mission
<soulero> I mean really, its nearly solid
<oni_link> I don't know why people don't like Niko. He's freaking awsome
<oni_link> Everyone likes CJ
<oni_link> more
<Kipkat07_USAF> CJ was a pimp
<sub06905> niko is best character
<soulero> make it a bun dem niko!
<oni_link> meh CJ's was cheesy imo
<oni_link> *story and his character
<Kipkat07_USAF> I liked the gang element
<sub06905> i liked SA for its cheats
<SirGanjalf> oni_link: What? I though CJ was the least likeable of all speaking protagonists
<oni_link> yeah that was fun
<twilight_sprinkle> niko is pretty cool, even if he was a war criminal and other-kinds-of-crimes criminal
<Alchemist> oni_link: I dunno, the forced stereotypical ghetto gangbanger persona got annoying after a while.
<oni_link> SirGanjalf: everywhere I look, people tell me they like CJ the most
<pony_7777> i liked CJ for his char. customization
<oni_link> Alchemist: yeah, thats exactly what Im saying
<oni_link> it was cheesy
<oni_link> and forced, soo very forced
<RainbowPengy> those guys have a pretty bad aim
<SirGanjalf> oni_link: Probably fanboys who think that if they like game, they have to like everything in it
<sub06905> stormtrooperaim.exe
<Alchemist> and for Kipkat07_USAF :) : http://jcp.aip.org/resource/1/jcpsa6/v83/i12/p6275_s1?isAuthorized=no
<Kipkat07_USAF> My favorite thing to do in these kind of missions is to call a 6 star wanted level and then when cops get here just hide
<oni_link> oh and I agree twilight_sprinkle and sub06905
<Kipkat07_USAF> Cops and enemies fight for major lulz
<Alchemist> I wish I had a better pc. Cant run GTA 4
<sub06905> i can run gta 4 decently on my laptop :)
<twilight_sprinkle> my skyrim lags even on 800x600
<twilight_sprinkle> hell, even on 640x480
<oni_link> SirGanjalf: I liked San Andreas because it actually expanded on the size of the overworld and allowed more interaction
<SirGanjalf> Luckily it runs pretty decent on my not-so-high-end PC
<RainbowPengy> i can run any game that released so far without problem :3
<oni_link> and the gang war stuff was cool
<Kipkat07_USAF> I can run fallout w/ minimal lag but skyrim runs soo laggy
<RainbowPengy> been*
<oni_link> other than that, I dislike the story for San Andreas and CJ
<twilight_sprinkle> the lighting is what makes skyrim lag as hell for me
<sub06905> um jacob
<soulero> you know, most wines contain tritated water, which is radioactive
<sub06905> sight~
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: try putting your shader and shadowing lower, that should help
<soulero> but you know, very very small amounts that occur naturally
<Alchemist> oni_link: gta isnt usually big on the stories, though Vice city's was better than SA's imo.
<sub06905> dat broken siren
<RainbowPengy> xD only half the sound
<oni_link> Alchemist: I liked that one too but it had scarface written all over it
<Alchemist> is this a cyclops squad car? :d
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: is that in-game options? cause i have them all on low already, even got some lighting mod that helped a bit
<oni_link> III and IV are my favorites so far
<Alchemist> oni_link: well I guess it was kinda the point.
<sub06905> gta4 is the only gta i beat the story so far
<RainbowPengy> i never rly like those game
<RainbowPengy> only had fun messing around with friends
<oni_link> Alchemist: yeah but it was too transparent about that
<KrazyNoobs> problem, officer?
<twilight_sprinkle> i beat gta: sa, and the psp gta's minus chinatown
<Kipkat07_USAF> porbelm officer
<twilight_sprinkle> the psp ones were great
<SirGanjalf> oni_link: Story was ok at the beginning(that is, if you don't mind ghetto climate), but later after leaving Los Santos it has lost consistency. Some of the mission were James Bond shit - fun, but deadly for the plot
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: its in the setting iirc and have you also tried putting the draw setting lower and turning particles and water reflections off?
<SirGanjalf> *missions
<sub06905> i loved the gta libety city stories theme <3
<Alchemist> oni_link: thinking about it now, Im actually surprised noone raised an issue about the similarities legally :D
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: i think so
<oni_link> Alchemist: yeah thats true o.o
<Kipkat07_USAF> If I get pulled over Im going to pull out a trollface mask and say "Problem?"
<oni_link> SirGanjalf: Yeah the desert. thats all i have to say XD
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hi
<twilight_sprinkle> dat ad...
<oni_link> Salivex! *imitates a tranny's voice* Now I can suck a LOLIPOP all night
<pony_7777> oni_link: have you turned off anti-aliasing? edges look crap, but saves major resources
<KrazyNoobs> Kipkat07_USAF You and me think in the same way... that's why I have a trollface mask sitting in the compartment under the driver's seat in my car. LOL
<Kipkat07_USAF> XD
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_7777: hes giving me advice :P
<oni_link> pony_7777: I was just about to suggest that to twilight_sprinkle , Im trying to see what can be done to free resources
<sub06905> serial killer in city... and worried about the nickname for him :D
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_7777: but ill check that
<twilight_sprinkle> thx for advice
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: youre gonna get jaggies when you move your camera but it should help the game run smoother
<soulero> - start of brokebakc mountain -
<RainbowPengy> yea what can you afford *stare at the car in the back*
<NocturnalBlade> Ok guys i think im gonna go hit the hay, see ya later for BMN :)
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: hm well ill try it. werent there different kinds of anti-aliasing?
<twilight_sprinkle> bye NocturnalBlade
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: also try putting model and textures to lower settings if you havent already. and if you have multiple cores, enable that in the settings. some games take advantage of multiple cores . theres different settings but to make games run smoother I usually turn it off altogether
<RainbowPengy> and some game take one core by default
<oni_link> like all valve games by default
<Kipkat07_USAF> NOOO ALL THE NUDE MAGAZINES DESTROYED!!
<sub06905> nuuuuuuuuu the apartment ;~;
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: well if skyrim can do that, ill try it, thanks
<oni_link> no problem twilight_sprinkle
<sub06905> sumi have you played throught this story already?
<sub06905> thorugh*
<[]DeadpoolDash> lolz
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: this is the end?
*Kipkat07_USAF sings along with the radio
<[]DeadpoolDash> through
<sub06905> twilight_sprinkle: nope
<twilight_sprinkle> ok
<sub06905> far from it
<oni_link> Im running on old hardware so I know what youre going through. I cant run skyrim at all XD video memory is too low and its soldered on
<sub06905> roman stop your bitching
<RainbowPengy> not being able to run game sucks that why i made sure i could run everything
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: nope its not the end yet
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: how far?
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: i think like less than a third of the way
<twilight_sprinkle> aw poor roman
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: ah ok
<oni_link> RainbowPengy: yeah, thats why Im saving up for a gaming laptop
<Buytoast> never saw this far into the game before
<Buytoast> poor roman
<oni_link> but everyone says I should get a desktop
<pony_7777> gaming laptop is an oxymoron
<oni_link> cause its cheaper and all that
<RainbowPengy> i have a custom made desktop
*Kipkat07_USAF sings "Movin on up
<RainbowPengy> costed alot but had no problem for about 3 year
<twilight_sprinkle> now its nikos turn to have a meltdown
<oni_link> there used to be a glitch you can do with that wooden wardrobe. you climb it from the left and wiggle around and then you climb through the wall and fall through the map and end up outside, did they patch that yet Sumica ?
<pony_7777> oni_link: desktops are easyer to upgrade
<Kipkat07_USAF> she sounds EXACTLY like my math teacher
<RainbowPengy> and less easy to over heat too
<pony_7777> that too
<oni_link> pony_7777: I know theyre more future proof
<Alchemist> arent desktops tend to be cheaper than laptops with a similar performance?
<oni_link> If I wanted to build one that could run games out now at max, what would my budget be?
<Kipkat07_USAF> that car is called a Coquette Sumica
<oni_link> Alchemist: mostly better for cheaper
<[]DeadpoolDash> badger badger badger badger badger
<Alchemist> oni_link: I guess 1000 usd
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Man, I can't wait 'till GTA V.
<pony_7777> better performance, if you know how to set up the guts
<eraykaan> hello y'all
<oni_link> I think im gonna buy a prebuilt overclocked system. in terms of processors idk if i should go with AMD or Intel
<eraykaan> hello?
<sub06905> oh this guy
<pony_7777> oni_link: you should buy the parts and build/OC it yourself.
<Kipkat07_USAF> I was going to overclock my moms computer but she would have shotgun diarreha
<Alchemist> oni_link: do what I did: read a f*ckton of reviews. Dont necessarily rely on other's opinion.
<Kipkat07_USAF> hi eraykaan
<twilight_sprinkle> and then he was on camera
<eraykaan> 'Sup sugarcube?
<twilight_sprinkle> welp
<oni_link> I know for a fact I want to go with AMD for graphics
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi eraykaan
<sub06905> niko is camera shy
<SirGanjalf> "Sorry
<oni_link> but for processors im still unsure
<Kipkat07_USAF> what OS are you gonna use
<pony_7777> oni_link: intel is better for OCing, typicaly
<twilight_sprinkle> heh back to small-time missions
<eraykaan> twilight_sprinkle: howdy sugarcube?
<Kipkat07_USAF> Linux is best OS
<RainbowPengy> rly ?
<twilight_sprinkle> im good eraykaan ,you?
<eraykaan> im ok
<RainbowPengy> but theres alot of game not compatible linux aint it ?
<twilight_sprinkle> k eraykaan :)
<eraykaan> Kipkat07_USAF: GLaDOS is best OS
<oni_link> I used to have a tower with an X4 black edition, that processor was nice :3 I think I might go with that again
<Alchemist> Kipkat07_USAF: I cant be assed to learn to use it and win works just fine for the stuff I use it for.
<RainbowPengy> yea well glados may be the best os but she wants to kill you too
<Kipkat07_USAF> Windows is good for steam games
<[]DeadpoolDash> isnt steam coming to linux?
<oni_link> yeah
<oni_link> it is
<pony_7777> ubuntu only
<oni_link> Im gonna make a dual boot
<eraykaan> GLaDOS is good for killing
<Kipkat07_USAF> once that happens Im completely switching to Linux. I dual boot vista and ubuntu
<sub06905> stalking
<[]DeadpoolDash> ewwww vista
<oni_link> Nvidia is horrible at giving linux drivers right? I dont really remember
<pony_7777> 2012, not using 7
<Kipkat07_USAF> http://www.thatawesomeshirt.com/images/get/319/shirt_main/
<sub06905> u meen 8
<sub06905> :D
<pony_7777> not a fan of 8
<Kipkat07_USAF> Win 8 is garbage
<eraykaan> i'm using windows 8 >_>
<Kipkat07_USAF> imo
<RainbowPengy> lol did you know you can download and upgrade window 32 bit to 64 for free and its legit by microsoft
<oni_link> Im fine with 7 , I was thinking of making a dual boot tower with ubuntu
<aniderp|bestcakeever> yayyy movie night
<RainbowPengy> i did
<pony_7777> how is it? looks like a complete redisign.
<Kandarihu> RainbowPengy, I never heard that.
<pony_7777> @eraykaan
<oni_link> i couldnt hear what you said about the drivers Sumica , I had to answer the phone just then :c
<RainbowPengy> i had win7 32 and now i have 64bit
<eraykaan> let'ssquish some people!
<[]DeadpoolDash> windows 8 looks like the X-Box 360 Dashboard
<eraykaan> squish
<Kipkat07_USAF> Im the one linux elitist whose a condescending arrogant elitist to anyone who uses windows or *shudders* apple...
<eraykaan> squish
<RainbowPengy> aslong as it the same version
<oni_link> ah thanks how come though?
<oni_link> ah so it takes up resources
<pony_7777> Kipkat07_USAF: you using Gentoo?
<eraykaan> *whispers*you know you want to squish people
<Kipkat07_USAF> pony_7777: I dont know coding language yet but once I learn that and pass the IT A+ exam Im gonna upgrade straight to debian
<oni_link> so would I be okay making a linux tower on nvidia hardware?
<eraykaan> i know coding >_>
<oni_link> thats really the only reason I havent done so yet
<[]DeadpoolDash> If you are using an Intel system go nVidia. If you are using an AMD system go AMD. They talk to each other better that way.
<pony_7777> Kipkat07_USAF: i have a deb machine. works nice. no lang. skills needed, really
<SirGanjalf> asshole, stole your car
<Kipkat07_USAF> my back hurts

<Kipkat07_USAF> I want to lay down because my back hurts but I dont want to fall asleep
<Kipkat07_USAF> should I?
<oni_link> Well thanks for the advice everyone

<aniderp|bestcakeever> yes
<Gold_Demona> I wouldn't say I'm a yaoi "fan" per se, but I do entertain thoughts of some oddball shipping. XD

<aniderp|bestcakeever> she would be the best vampire wife ever <3
<Ninjazz> I do not have an emote that properly expresses my expression.

<Gold_Demona> I draw the line at incest pairings though. That I don't find entertaining at all. >.>
<aniderp|bestcakeever> oh i started this one story
<aniderp|bestcakeever> about dead or alive..
<aniderp|bestcakeever> ayane and kasumi.. i was writing it then in the game i found they were sisters..
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but in my story they are best friends who are lovers..
<IFDreebs> ha ha time for wincest? >.>
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i had no clue they were sisters until the end of the game..

<aniderp|bestcakeever> i know leia is a princess
<aniderp|bestcakeever> anakin is luke's father
<Sun> duh duh duh
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Luke and Leia are twins
<Gold_Demona> Their mom died giving birth to them.
<Gold_Demona> Which was RIGHT after Anakin fell to the dark side and became Darth Vader
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: in one of the most contested prequels ever
<MadSurge> :S
<aniderp|bestcakeever> didnt anakin get burned alive?
<MadSurge> aniderp|bestcakeever: that too
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Personally, I take the basic story of the prequels as canon, but the movies themselves I ignore.
<MadSurge> But he survived
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yeah
*aniderp|bestcakeever licks someone
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: That's why he ends up in the big black suit when he becomes Vader. It keeps him alive. :P

<aniderp|bestcakeever> gonna but for my family
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and my work sis
<Gold_Demona> That's cool. :>
<aniderp|bestcakeever> and maybe some stuff for me just because its cool
<aniderp|bestcakeever> xD
<Gold_Demona> lol Yeah, gotta buy yourself some stuff while you're at it. :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> bring all the money!
<Gold_Demona> I'm almost done with my Christmas shopping. Just got two more kids to buy for, and for that I need word from my brother in-law on what they want.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> you have a kid?
<Gold_Demona> ....And by "kids" I mean kids in their upper teens. :D
<Gold_Demona> One of them's in college. :D
<Gold_Demona> HELL no I don't have kids
<Gold_Demona> Only kids I buy for are nieces and nephews
<Alchemist> I dont like kids
<Gold_Demona> I like kids well enough, but I don't think I'd be a good parent
<Alchemist> not yet at least
<Alchemist> what does the hubby say?
<Gold_Demona> Hubby doesn't like kids. XP
<Gold_Demona> He no wanty at all.
<Alchemist> Renting kids should be invented.
<[]DeadpoolDash> its called baby sitting and you get paid for it
<Gold_Demona> Also foster parenting
<Gold_Demona> That kinda counts as renting kids
<[]DeadpoolDash> so much bullshit involved doing the foster stuff though
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but your hubby was a kid once
<Alchemist> I dont know how exactly it works, but I've never heard anything positive about it.
<Gold_Demona> aniderp|bestcakeever: Um... so?
<Gold_Demona> That means nothing. =P
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hehe
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i still act like a child sometimes is that bad?
<Alchemist> not necessarily
<Gold_Demona> Nope
<Gold_Demona> I still do sometimes.
<Gold_Demona> Sometimes to make my hubby laugh, sometimes to make him roll his eyes at me. =P
<Alchemist> If you accept responsibility while doing so then its okay.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> lol at work me and my work sis act liek 7 year olds sorta xD
<aniderp|bestcakeever> but we can cause we are adults
<aniderp|bestcakeever> we need some funn....
<Alchemist> Im far too serious, but I cant change it.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> my mental age is like 15 xD
<MadSurge> Alchemist: you're still pleasant to talk to :)
<aniderp|bestcakeever> im 20.. with a mental age of 15
<Gold_Demona> My husband's really serious too, but I think I'm slowly corrupting him to the childish side. :D
<aniderp|bestcakeever> thats normal right?
<Gold_Demona> Ultimate proof: he watches ponies with me. :D
<Alchemist> MadSurge: :) thanks.
<Vordox> I'm 27, with an mental age of 200+

<Meanwhile> Man I love Huey.
<oni_link> Oh here we go XD
<Nick> paganism is good
<oni_link> lol
<Meanwhile> Charlie Brown.
<Nick> looool
<MadSurge> As long as there are no human sacrifices I'm fine with paganism :D
<Kandarihu> He's mixing little-known truth with politically correct nonsense, and other ideas that I honestly hope are just "Huey being Huey".
<Meanwhile> You don't actually think Jesus was born on Christmas do you?
<oni_link> Nigga better pay what he owes hahaha
<Nick> special fx
<MadSurge> :D
<Nick> loooooooooool
<MadSurge> Sincurly?

<SpeccyRush> man up
<Meanwhile> Heart attack.

<MadSurge> Oh yeah, because plastic pellets hurt sooo much
<Meanwhile> The joke is that's what your news actually sounds like.
<oni_link> I want to go to a white neighborhood and do that hahaha
<oni_link> Kandarihu: yeah
<CTHULHU> back, what i miss?
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: American news broadcasts :|
<oni_link> Meanwhile: my news? I wouldnt know since I don't watch that garbage?
<oni_link> I'd rather read an article
<Meanwhile> Should've probably aimed at that Kandarihu to avoid the confusion so that's my bad.
<oni_link> the news is always out for the shock factor. all they care about is ratings
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, the news media goes through hoops in order to NOT sound racist against arabs or blacks. Most of them even compromise their integrity of their reporting out of such paranoia.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> AHEM
<Meanwhile> Implying they have any integrity.
<CTHULHU> snow!
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, well they should still be held to a higher standard than they are.
<Meanwhile> Well, you're racist anyway so you probably would say that.
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, I'm not racist.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> So much tension between you two...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> If I didn't know any better, I'd put you both on the shipping list!
<Jmo> That was horrible Scoot.
<Meanwhile> Mm.
<oni_link> Meanwhile x Kandarihu hahaha
<Havok> ^^
<oni_link> OTP
<Scoot-Scootaloo> You're horrible, Jmo :|
<Jmo> Only to you.
<Kandarihu> All I cn say is that I agree with Jmo
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Don't be such a Tsundere, Meanwhile~
<SpeccyRush> you can't ship Meanwhile he already is part of a otp
<Meanwhile> I-it's not like I want you or anything. Baka.
<oni_link> oh is he SpeccyRush ?
<Ninjazz> K-kawaii...
<Kandarihu> SpeccyRush, I'm straight.
<Jmo> He wasn't even implying you.

<CTHULHU> oh my god who the hell cares
<oni_link> calm thine tits CTHULHU
<SpeccyRush> oh my god family guy quote

<MadSurge> YAAAAAAY
<oni_link> XD
<alexxm|colt> i guess Dark92Enigma oh yeah i also got a couple of wwe dvds yesterday
<AttackWithHugs> Mario is srs bzns
<Kandarihu> I decided not to vote this time. This is the only time I DECIDED not to vote.
<MadSurge> The toads are played by women!
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm|colt: Bret Hart and CM Punk?
<Meanwhile> Bret The Hitman Hart.
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma best of king of the ringn and best ppv matches of 2009 - 2010
<Kandarihu> It's because I'll be on the road during both Brony Movie Nights.
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: that's funny, the ONLY time i decided not to vote, is when i got too late to do so.......and the movie i was about to pick got picked by somepony else.
<Dark92Enigma> the next week, however, i won
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: so you know him?
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, awesome.
<Dark92Enigma> btw, that movie was WFRR?
<Dark92Enigma> Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
<otakon> so, Two Best Friends Play huh?
<Kandarihu> Dark92Enigma, probably not.
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: GREAT movie
<Scoot-Scootaloo> otakon: No, bad Game Grumps commentary
<SpeccyRush> I picked WFRR
<otakon> oh
<Scoot-Scootaloo> OH WAIT, they are ALL bad~
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: wait, this isn't Game Grumps
<Kandarihu> None of the movies I've been picking have ever been picked by anyone else.
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: screw you they'
<otakon> re funy!
<Dark92Enigma> otakon: yes, and i wasn't there to write the review, i was about to give it a categoric 10/10
<Scoot-Scootaloo> otakon: way to be a super slueth
<Scoot-Scootaloo> sleuth*
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: way to be a chicken
<otakon> :P
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 0/10
<oni_link> Why do they compare those two series all the time? Theyre different
<Dark92Enigma> the only time i've won so far, is the pony episode A: Friendship Is Magic (Pilot)
<Meanwhile> Because they're similar.
<oni_link> same concept but different execution
<Kandarihu> I change my choice of A Movie from time to time. But my B Movie has always been the same time since it came out on DVD this Summer.
<Dark92Enigma> SpeccyRush: i know, and i wasn't there to congratulate you :)......Congratulations
<Dark92Enigma> so far, i haven't changed my A and B movies, but the pony episodes do change from time to time
<Meanwhile> Alejandro, you've got to play some of the shitstorm of scariness vids.
<SpeccyRush> thanks.. I guess
<otakon> hiya Meanwhile
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Definitely Maybe, Meanwhile :$
<otakon> wow what a dick
<oni_link> hahaha
<otakon> XD
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: DARK SOULS!
<otakon> please?
<MadSurge> That succulent Toad's ass :D
<Meanwhile> Never should the phrase "Succulent toad ass" be uttered.
<otakon> Meanwhile: and yet you have :3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Wigga, this is a CHRISTMAS stream~
<oni_link> never indeed Meanwhile XD
<MadSurge> :O

<Scoot-Scootaloo> If ONLY I knew...
<otakon> wow Cat is a cheapskate bastard
<Lil_B> I kinda alwways hated this show :(
<Meanwhile> ^
<Lil_B> and hi everyone :)
<oni_link> i forgot who those VAs were famous for doing work as
<Meanwhile> 'Lo Lil_B.
<alexxm> how are things Lil_B
<oni_link> hi Lil_B been awhile eh?
<MadSurge> Didn't have Nickelodeon, so never saw this until adulthood
<MadSurge> Hey Lil_B :)
<Dark92Enigma> i can't believe i'm gonna say this: but even when i watched CatDog before Spongebob, i can't unhear him everytime i hear Dog talk
<otakon> I hear Ed Asner
<oni_link> hey its the Flying Dutchman
<otakon> Ed Asner IIRC
<Lil_B> thanks Meanwhile alexxm oni_link and MadSurge :)
<Laksen> what happend to the colares =
<Laksen> ?
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: did you bleach the video?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Too much?
<Lil_B> oni_link 2 weeks of no Internet :)
<otakon> too much
<otakon> Lil_B: THE HORROR
<oni_link> Lil_B: wow welcome back :3
<otakon> there we go, still looks a bit bleached but good
<Lil_B> otakon was ok, appearently I dfidn't even miss much :/
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Good enough~
<otakon> THE RABBIT
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Just... shield your eyes a bit
<oni_link> eww
<otakon> ugh
<otakon> even the NAME sounds abyssmal
<AttackWithHugs> "Cutest, sweetest"
<otakon> Rancine.... ew
<AttackWithHugs> He is obviously blind
<oni_link> I always hated that rabbit
<oni_link> and his niece or whatever
<oni_link> I wanna smack em with a bat
<otakon> oni_link: me too, he's like the main antagonist
<otakon> >I want to buy you
<otakon> >Slavery
<oni_link> yeah such a scumbag
<Lil_B> ... in this Universe, Lifes of regular Citizens are Buyable...
<otakon> also yeah if he buys them then doesn't that mean he gets his money back?
<otakon> oh look it's Winslow
<otakon> A smaller moustacheless version of Meanwhile
<otakon> not too much smaller though
<oni_link> Who did Winslow's VA do?
<Meanwhile> Ba-dum tish.
<oni_link> Its very familiar
<oni_link> Rocko maybe?
<oni_link> Holy crap, its sun out here
<otakon> yeah same here
<otakon> and that MIGHT be Rocko
<otakon> Doesn't Winslow LIVE in their house?
<oni_link> It sounds kinda like em
<oni_link> and he does
<oni_link> he has tunnels everywhere though
<otakon> inb4 that's the real Santa
<oni_link> ... I want to make these rabbits dissapear
<oni_link> forever
<otakon> lol
<otakon> NO CHRISTMAS?!
<otakon> THE HORROR!
<AttackWithHugs> NOOOO!
<otakon> FOUREVER!
<otakon> and of course they BLAME IT ALL ON CATDOG
<otakon> bc EVERYTHING is Catdog's fault apparently in this show
<oni_link> yup
<CTHULHU> meh.
<Meanwhile> When in doubt, blame the freak.
<otakon> I never liked that about this show
<otakon> Seriously they blame EVERYTHING on those two
<oni_link> everything...
<otakon> GLOBAL WARMING! IT'S CATDOG'S FAULT!
<otakon> I GOT LEUKEMIA! IT'S CATDOG'S FAULT!
<otakon> yeah I applaud the show for it's insanity and the message of being yourself but CD being the scapegoat for EVERYTHING turned me off greatly from it.
<Kandarihu> Overcommercialization of Christmas! It's Catdog's fault!
<oni_link> otakon: yeah that was always an issue for me too
<otakon> YIKES
<otakon> and then SLAVERY
<LightTrooper105> hallo everypony o.o
<otakon> it's nearly as bad as Cannabilism in "The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy"
<Meanwhile> Slavery Catdog's f-oh no, hang on that was the bible.
<otakon> hiya LightTrooper105
<MadSurge> Hey LightTrooper105! :)
<otakon> GRAB HER!
*LightTrooper105 slaps otakon and MadSurge with muffins
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, no.
<CTHULHU> let her die
<oni_link> lol
<otakon> well
<otakon> that was fitting
<otakon> ooh, muffins
<Meanwhile> Yes. And if you decide to block that out of your chosen circle of belief I'll start talking about the crusades instead.
<oni_link> that did improve her situation when you think about it hahaha
<alexxm> bye guys
<otakon> Meanwhile: next you'll say the priest's got molesting kids from the bible when really they are just freaks
<otakon> bye alexxm take care
<oni_link> later alexxm
<Meanwhile> otakon: No that's just freaks.
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, the Bible only said that masters should be kind to their slaves.
<otakon> Meanwhile: besides slavery has existed before the bible
<otakon> bc well humanity wasn't but two hairs away from a baboon
<oni_link> mmm
<Meanwhile> True, but not on the scale it eventually did. The Bible says that sinners skin turned black, which led to the dehumanisation of black people, if you need the rest explained to you you're too young to be on the internet.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> HEY! No religion talk during Christmas >: (
<oni_link> lol the bible is racist
<otakon> Meanwhile: oh shit I forgot about that
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Even if it is a Pagan holiday...
<oni_link> a little late for that Scoot-Scootaloo XD
<otakon> Meanwhile: that Mormon origins video said the same thing
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, I don't remember anything about that. Sounds like you're making that up.
<oni_link> theye been going at it for awhile
<Meanwhile> Sounds like you should read your own holy book.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> yeah, I know. Studying ATM
<otakon> Kandarihu: well I know that is what the Mormon's believe
<oni_link> I has no religion hah
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: I treat the bible as any other religion and myth book tbh
<Scoot-Scootaloo> So take your communists beliefs to the PM's please~
<otakon> lol
<Meanwhile> I could go on about how shellfish are evil and so are women who wear trousers, but the self proclaimed angry jealous god really nails it.
<otakon> lol
<Meanwhile> And yeah alright Alej, done now.
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, this is a three way argument, now.
<otakon> women who wear trousers are evil...
<otakon> XD
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Kandarihu: Not anymore.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> So stop that shizzle
<oni_link> Scoot-Scootaloo has spoken
<Meanwhile> The exact line for sake of clarity is "Women shall not wear garments that pertain unto a man"
<Kandarihu> Well, it seems to be otakon and myself vs Meanwhile.
<Meanwhile> "For to do is an abomination unto the lord thy God" I think I got that right.
<otakon> no one is vs. anything
<otakon> he EATS SOAP?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Kandarihu: I can make it a two way when I click the BAN button...
<oni_link> otakon: yup
<otakon> no one is arguing
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: seriously no one is getting their jimmies rustled
<oni_link> hahaha
<Scoot-Scootaloo> That's what I thought :$
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, Meanwhile is saying things that I have to respond to.
<Meanwhile> Albeit with nothing of substance.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> PMs. Learn them
<otakon> yeah I'm not trying to argue
<otakon> I'm just commenting on the oddities of The Bible
<Scoot-Scootaloo> And otakon... he's just otakon. No need to argue with him~
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Luv ya, otakon <3
<otakon> oh thanks Chick-Chicken
<Kandarihu> And I'm terrible with one on one debates.
<SpeccyRush> one does not Have to respond
<Vordox> <-----oh god...
<otakon> and KICKED
<oni_link> lol didnt she get preggers
<otakon> and BACK
<otakon> or not
<Ninjazz> But one has to get kicked for using bold text.
<otakon> eeyup
<SpeccyRush> hmm forgot to set auto rejoin
<Kandarihu> SpeccyRush, uh, bold still counts as a color code, I guess.
<otakon> Arthur Christma
<oni_link> oh shiiii its arthur
<Squallken> Arthur?
<otakon> SpeccyRush: bold is WHITE
<CTHULHU> really?
<SpeccyRush> Oh I knew I'd be kicked for it
<otakon> CTHULHU: sure why not?
<Meanwhile> Autojoin doesn't work if it's instant on here anyway.
<SpeccyRush> ah
<Scoot-Scootaloo> You got a PROBLEM with Arthur, nyuggah?
<otakon> horrible song though
<Kandarihu> SpeccyRush, do you have Autojoin on your X-Chat? I can't seem to find it on my Hexchat. It's a different fork, I know.
<otakon> NO TINSEL!
<otakon> I freaking HATE tinsel
<otakon> it's a pain in the ass to put up and take down
<Meanwhile> What's wrong with tinsel.
<Meanwhile> How fucking hard can it be to hang glittery string on a tree?
<SpeccyRush> Kandarihu, honestly don't know don't use clients so much to know yet
<Meanwhile> I've got some on my bedframe it didn't cause me intense discomfort.
<otakon> Meanwhile: if you want it to look right, you have to do it ONE BRANCH AND STRING AT A TIME
<Meanwhile> You do it weird.
<otakon> othewise it clumps and doesn't hang properly
<Kandarihu> otakon, I haven't done Christmas trees since my cats started knocking them over. But before then, it's a matter of rotating the tree as you place it. It's easy if you do it like that.
<otakon> and it looks bunched together, also that is the most eloquent 4 yr. old ever.
<oni_link> lol tinsel
<oni_link> i dont use it
<otakon> COMMERICALISM!
<otakon> YAY CAPITALISM!
<oni_link> the talking what??
<otakon> Should have told the guys in the fiftes about the horror the Green Menace instead of them worrying about the Red Menace
<Squallken> and i thought "grandma got runover by a raindeer" was bad
<oni_link> lol
<VenHur> I. HATE. MY. FUCKING. 10. YEAR. OLD. NIECE.
<oni_link> why VenHur
<oni_link> ?

<VenHur> ...Don't ask...
<Kandarihu> Personally, I think there should just be a balance between commercialization and the more-important intangibilities of Christmas. Let the stores run their discounts. It's up to the shoppers to keep their cool over this.

<Wrek> 05Twilight: please keep it english in the main chat room

<EPIC_luna> hi everypony

<TheGentleManBrony> WHY IS NO ONE TALKING?!
<pony_8221> Hi

<TheGentleManBrony> MC Vaginas back in this bitch
<SpeccyRush> yes call a mod a whore that will end well
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Ok I was watching the Morpha fight in OOT and I find it sad fucking Morpha on a N64 looks better and more fluidly animated than fucking Chaos from Sonic Adventure
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: that's bc Chaos was in a launch title
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> otakon: The thing is they made chaos because they wanted something only the Dreamcast could do
<otakon> plus lower polygon count means usually more fluid animation
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Yet N64 does that shit fine
<otakon> yeah I feel you
<otakon> but it's simple
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Plus chaos looks plain retarded
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> well his final form anyway
<otakon> lower polygons + low res textures USUALLY=better frame rate
<TheGentleManBrony> gak
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Funnily enough DX made Perfect Chaos look sort of worse
<otakon> brb

<PuddleJumper> ide like to see an all luna ep, and an all derpy ep, but so far they have had all good to great eps
<ouo_ewe> yeah... i miss the stream
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> PuddleJumper: Good luckw ith the derpy one...
<PuddleJumper> the pinky one had me and my kid laughing my ass off
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Soccer moms already had a fuckign fit with derpy being mentioned by name alone
<Arcium> i think i got a mlp plushie somewhere im our house :D
<PuddleJumper> yeah, well, it is a kids show...ment to sell toys....you would think from looking at the derpy brushies going for 100 bucks they would go....hmmm well, screw them!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> PuddleJumper: You know why they had a fit about derpy?
<ouo_ewe> Arcium what plushie? c:
<PuddleJumper> the same reason they have a fit about anything remotely contravertial? nothing better to bitch about?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> PuddleJumper: They though she was making fun of retarded people...>.>
*ouo_ewe wants lyra
<TheGentleManBrony> Because they think us disabled people are so fucking sensitive we cant speak for ourselves.
<otakon> http://orendsrange.blogspot.com/2012/12/power-rangers-legends-ios-game-now.html#.UMto93fNmSp
<Alchemist> I thought the reason Derpy's voice/appearance was changed is that one of the staff has a mentally challenged kid and she didnt know what derp/derpy means and she interpreted the name/phrase to be pejorative in nature.
<PuddleJumper> i love derpy
<AppleBloom> allo bronystate
<ouo_ewe> really new voice not so bad
<TheGentleManBrony> Of course I just have spina bifida and possible autism so I might not be one to talk.
<PuddleJumper> yeah. the one that actually wrote her and liked her
<Alchemist> PuddleJumper: was it Amy Keating Rogers?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The editing for the derpy scene was so half assed
<ouo_ewe> i don't even see difference how it more or less offends somebody
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> There was no emotion in it at all
<PuddleJumper> i think she is fine the way she is. Shes cute and funny and it dosent matter. They should just let her be what she is, people can think for themselves
<ouo_ewe> i don't get why they even need to change it
<ouo_ewe> what purpose?
<ouo_ewe> it's just stupid
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Again, people are way too god damn sensitive these days
<AppleBloom> are we talking about why they changed derpy's voice and slightly underped her eyes?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> ouo_ewe: SO we dont "offend" the retarded people
<TheGentleManBrony> Last night I had a dream where an animated girl spoke entirelly in that iTunes edit voice.
<Alchemist> btw Im happy that the episode even aired. It was a glorious day for the fandom. The scene being changed doesnt take away it's glory in my book. :)
<Arcium> it's a gen 3.5 plushie, oh god why'
<Buytoast> Gray Controversy was a disgrace
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Alchemist: They could have put some emotion into the editing though..
<Buytoast> the change was neccessary
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> There was no fucking emotion in that edit
<TheGentleManBrony> SpadeKyurem[WoW] You're not being disrespecting of my demographic are you?
<PuddleJumper> nah, it went out the original way, these days its on the net forever. so why bother
<Kandarihu> I'm watching Santa Claus Conquers the Martians MST3K right now
<TheGentleManBrony> I mean dont get me wrong I hate the edit too.
<otakon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdVrOz379AI
<Ryunosuke> oh dear\
<Ryunosuke> Dan vs. fim updated a bit :p
<ouo_ewe> SpadeKyurem[WoW], yeah tollerate shit motherfucker... There is nothing such a bullshit in age of Doom and Blood
<PuddleJumper> im not being disrespectfully at all, she can be derpy just they way they put her and it changes nothing, shes still a loveable cute char
<TheGentleManBrony> She's not cute without the derp eyes.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Unfortunatley Soccer Moms seem to think everything offends people
<PuddleJumper> mah shes fine either way, though shes cuter with derp eyes
<MadSurge> Just like Satan is in everything new for the Pope :D
<Saigneur> hey hey hey stay out of my shed !
<ouo_ewe> They just made it more frustraiting for community and character understanding.
<TheGentleManBrony> Just like Sweetie Belle wouldn't be cute without the curled mane.
<Saigneur> hello once again
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Its about as retarded as parents complaining people on the internet and online games are being rude to their kids
<TheGentleManBrony> and Applebloom isn't as cute without the bow.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> ITS THE FUCKING INTERNET, DUMBASS
<MadSurge> But curls are clearly disrespectful for people with straight hair!
<PuddleJumper> squeeky bell will be cute so long as she keeps squeekin
<ouo_ewe> SpadeKyurem[WoW], totally agreed, why they even didn't watch for his childrens?!
<TheGentleManBrony> I think at this point Claire IS doing it on purpose.
<ouo_ewe> so lame
<MadSurge> PuddleJumper: well her VA doesn't seem to want to stop squeaking :D
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> In fact in the report on that I swore I saw a kid playing fucking Halo
<MadSurge> TheGentleManBrony: oh she is in fact
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> <.<
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Any parent who thinks people on the internet won't be rude to you're kid is a moron
<ouo_ewe> if you won't your child see some stuff, it's your duty watch for this
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> *your
<ouo_ewe> and don't blame tv or internet
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Matter afact why the fuck are you letting your 6-8 year old kid on the fucking internet
<TheGentleManBrony> Emergency edible BOOoots
<TheGentleManBrony> THere needs to be a way to write a squeak.
<otakon> Well I have bad news, truly bad news.
<TheGentleManBrony> Let's ask Claire to come up with one.
<otakon> There was a school shooting in Conneticut
<PuddleJumper> maybe Wh~at! (~squeek)
<otakon> 26 dead
<CTHULHU> HA
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Its on the news right now otakon
<otakon> CTHULHU: HA?
<CTHULHU> yes, ha.
<otakon> CTHULHU: don't tell me you're actually LAUGHING about 18 CHILDREN being shot are you?
<CTHULHU> why not?
<otakon> it was a Elementary School
<TheGentleManBrony> ....and the other 8 just collapsed by themselves?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Who the fuck goes into a school and shoots up a bunch of children
<otakon> why not?
<otakon> WHY FUCKING NOT?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> CTHULHU: Go to hell
<Jmo> CTHULHU, you're literally the biggest retard.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I hope you burn
<otakon> HOW FUCKED UP ARE YOU?
<Buytoast> meh
<Eli> otakon: 26 dead is a terrible thing, and nothing to laugh about, but why don't people react the same way about ongoing wars?
<PuddleJumper> because this this isnt 4 chan. talk about this somewhere else
<Jmo> Get out of here you twat.
<otakon> Eli: bc it's SOLDIERS, not CHILDREN that have been gunned down for NO reason
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I never understand why these people do these shootings
<CTHULHU> i cant help it im really dark.
<otakon> CTHULHU: well at least keep it to yourself then
<Eli> otakon: it's not like there are no civilians killed in a war, right?
<CTHULHU> why
<otakon> Eli: no there are not
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What fucking reason does ANYONE have to go to a school and shoot up kids
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WHY
<Eli> otakon: that's very naive of you
<otakon> CTHULHU: bc it shows that you are a sociopath that has no empathy and therefore are a potential threat to others
<Buytoast> wait, you actually think civilians aren't killed in wars?
<otakon> no
<otakon> I didn't say that
<Eli> Buytoast: right?
<Buytoast> what do you believe gumdrops flying around by shooting fizzy pop out their ass?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh god damn it Buytoast let him finish
<Buytoast> i aint stoppin him
<Buytoast> but he aint finishin
<otakon> it's different than just a random person walking into a SCHOOL and gunning down 10 year olds
<CTHULHU> meh.
<TheGentleManBrony> actually Otakon u did basically say that.
<TheGentleManBrony> verbatim
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> CTHULHU: I normally would never say this, but I hope you fucking die
<Eli> otakon: how's that diffrent than random soldiers walking around killing 10 year olds?
<PuddleJumper> well, im a veteran, ive had my fill of dead anyones...im going back to minecraft
<Buytoast> you did say that there are not civilians killed in wars otakon
<CTHULHU> joks on you i want to die.
<TheGentleManBrony> Dude shut the fuck up.
<Buytoast> you literally said that they aren't, i can scroll up and screen cap it any everything boy
<otakon> Eli: bc soldiers USUALLY have orders not to shoot civilians and especially children
<Buytoast> i mean damn
<otakon> Buytoast: no I didn't
<TheGentleManBrony> Stop trying to be goth because you're desperate for attention.
<TheGentleManBrony> Its the same mistake I made.
<otakon> CTHULHU: get counseling man, really
<Buytoast> <Eli> otakon: it's not like there are no civilians killed in a war, right?[12:13:23] <CTHULHU> why[12:13:24] <otakon> Eli: no there are not
<otakon> ...
<Eli> otakon: riiiight... they usually turn the kids into soldiers so they can kill each other
<TheGentleManBrony> I fuckin painted my nails and hung out at the coffee shop all the time.
<Buytoast> c'mon man
<otakon> THAT WAS A TYPO
<CTHULHU> i did dident help
<Buytoast> SUDDENLY A TYPO
<otakon> I thought I just typed no there are
<TheGentleManBrony> Buytoast: He makes a good point
<Buytoast> honestly in a few days this shooting will be in the back of everyone's minds
<Buytoast> so eh
<Alchemist> what shooting?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Wow... how insensitive can you be?
<TheGentleManBrony> Buytoast We're still thinking about the Aurora Shooting aren't we?
<Buytoast> something about a nutter and a school
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WHO THE FUCK GOES INTO A KINDERGARDEN CLASS AND SHOOTS THE PLACE UP
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WHAT PURPOUSE DO YOU HAVE DOING THIS
<otakon> Alchemist: Conneticut
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: the insane
<TheGentleManBrony> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: dude take a fuckin chill pill.
<Alchemist> otakon: when?
<otakon> Alchemist: now
<otakon> seriously listening to a live report of it
<Alchemist> havent heard about it
<otakon> http://www.breakingnews.com/
<Alchemist> ouch
<Ryunosuke> i think i am going to have a concussion by the end of the day
<Alchemist> at least 20 down
<Alchemist> thats sad
<Ryunosuke> from all the head-desking
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also it seems common 90% of the time the shooter ends up killing himself
<Meanwhile> Unless one of you has a time machine there's really no point in discussing this.
<CTHULHU> no's gonna care about this in 2 weeks
<Ryunosuke> they are ALREADY talking about gun laws, gun regulations, disarming everyone, etc
<TheGentleManBrony> I always thought Connecticut was populated entirely by uber rich white people so I've just never given a shit about Connecticut.
*Kipkat07_USAF parachutes into the chat & hugs everyypony
<Ryunosuke> I point to Norway
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Wow...fucking insensitive much?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> God you people
<Buytoast> eh, it's just the flavor of the day
<Kipkat07_USAF> TheGentleManBrony: Im from CT and Im poor
<Ryunosuke> one guy, 100 odd dead BECAUSE NO ONE HAD A FUCKING GUN TO DEFEND THEMSELVES
<Buytoast> like that whole dark knight rises deal
<Eli> Meanwhile: is right. none of us were affected, and unles you plan to start a charity for the victims, there's no point
<Buytoast> nobody is still crying over that
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: bc they're self destructive but they are too COWARDLY to just go out themselves I would think
<Buytoast> well, probably the family of the deceased
<Buytoast> but in the large picture it's all but forgotten unless someone brings it up
<Eli> Ryunosuke: what if... he didn't have a gun?
<Kipkat07_USAF> TheGentleManBrony: but then again I lived most of my life in Florida
<Ryunosuke> let me put it this way
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You could be a little less insensitive about the whole damn thing Buytoast
<Buytoast> i could say the same thing about you gettin riled up
<Ryunosuke> if guns are outlawed, the only people that are going to have guns, are criminals, and I seriously doubt criminals are going to be conserned that they are breaking gun laws
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Buytoast: Well at least I actually seem to give a shit about this
<Meanwhile> Is thinking about those parents weeping over the Christmas presents they'd already wrapped going to make you feel any better SpadeKyurem[WoW]?
<otakon> yeah agreed
<otakon> so it's simple
<otakon> we have to DESTROY all the guns
<otakon> all of them
<otakon> and never make them again
<Ryunosuke> OH, Lets rob a bank, but no guns, THATS ILLEGAL
<Ryunosuke> really?
<otakon> well why not?
<otakon> destroy ALL the weapons
<Eli> otakon: yep. truer words have never been spoken
<CTHULHU> can we drop this, it's geting boring now.
<Alchemist> no guns seems to work for a lot of countries
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oryou know...get fucking security?
<Ryunosuke> Alchemist: however
<Meanwhile> This chat doesn't exist for your personal amusement, if you're bored you can piss off.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> And this is fucking America, you expect for someone to not have a gun?
<Ryunosuke> those countries have a vastly different culture than the US/Canada
<CTHULHU> bite me
<Kipkat07_USAF> otakon: i used to be far right on this issue but mow I kinda agree
<Eli> Alchemist: you should see switzerland. even knifes aren't allowed, and we have next to no casualties. except army weapons...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> a fucking 8 year old and 11 year old HELD UP A WOMAN IN A FUCKING CHURCH PARKINGLOT
<Ryunosuke> saying anti gun laws in the UK or Japan works doesnt mean we should try it in the US
<TheGentleManBrony> SpadeKyurem[WoW] weren't you the one who five minutes ago was saying how people are too sensitive? And now you're crying your eyes out about a guy shooting some kids, even though shooting happens every day and this just happened to make it on air.
<otakon> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: dear lord
<Eli> Ryunosuke: why?
<Meanwhile> Merry Christmas.
<Ryunosuke> Eli: cultural differences
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What I'm saying is you guys sound like you dont give a shit about any of this
<Eli> Ryunosuke: lol... guns are culture... that's so dumb
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You could at least care you know
<TheGentleManBrony> Why should we?
<Ryunosuke> not really
<CTHULHU> i dont
<Buytoast> who said we didn't care
<Alchemist> Ryunosuke: what differences are those exactly? I dont think US/Canadians are more vicious by nature.
<Buytoast> we jsut aren't spazzing over another shooting
<Eli> Ryunosuke: guns are culture and you wonder about a shooting in a school?
<TheGentleManBrony> Half of these kids were probably gonna grow up to be stupid wastes of space anyway.
<Buytoast> just because we aren't ranting and raving about how horrible this is doesn't mean we don't give two shits
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> TheGentleManBrony: Wow...asshole
<Ryunosuke> Eli: the US has had a culture where guns are predominant, ie. revolutionary war, Westward expansion of the 1800's, sport hunting, etc.
<Meanwhile> I don't care, but talking about it still isn't going to do anything. Yes it's absolutely tragic, yes it's not something that should ever happen in a civil society, but it did and no amount of "I am torn up about this" is going to make it better.
<Eli> TheGentleManBrony: hey now... don't get too offensive
<TheGentleManBrony> okay sorry Eli.
<Ryunosuke> Guns do not kill people
<TheGentleManBrony> Nuh uh
<otakon> people with guns kill people
<CTHULHU> ^
<Ryunosuke> they are just a tool to facilitate the process
<Eli> Ryunosuke: soooo the wars are now culture and were a good thing?
<Buytoast> gunpowder does
<otakon> actually more direct, PEOPLE kill people
<Buytoast> and who invented gunpowder?
<otakon> a gun is really a tool
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Guns arent the issue, its people using the damn guns
<Ryunosuke> people can kill people just fine WITHOUT guns
<Buytoast> that's right
<Buytoast> the Chinese
<Alchemist> same can be said about a butterknife
<TheGentleManBrony> a tool invented for the sole purpose of killing people so that argument is FUCKING STUPID
<TheGentleManBrony> jesus
<otakon> Ryunosuke: true but not 30 at a time in 30 seconds
<Buytoast> and what is China?
<Buytoast> you guessed it
<Buytoast> Communist
<Ryunosuke> Nuclear option
<Eli> Ryunosuke: guns just make it too easy and too quick.
<Gummi> So what is on later?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh boy here we go....
<Buytoast> This is all a Communist plot.
<otakon> Gummi: no idea, movies on tonight though
<Buytoast> But we will stand strong.
<Eli> Buytoast: communists!
<Ryunosuke> if you have a bigger gun than your enemy, your enemy isnt going to want to shoot you, or have serious reservations about doing so
<otakon> Buytoast: no it's not, get that conspiracy theory out of here
<Gummi> Anyone know the movie?
<TheGentleManBrony> Thank you Buytoast for trying to inject levity into this discourse
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Buytoast: You're over patriotic bullshit is getting old
<Lil_B> Buytoast I still think all people who wear glasses are suspicous, I mean, Hitler had Glasses!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> *your
<Alchemist> Ryunosuke: the insrugents are heavily outgunned. that doesnt seem to stop them
<Gummi> I was looking forward to christmas, but unfortunatly the world is gonna end.
<Eli> Ryunosuke: we all see you're in a pro war confirmation bias. you were raised like this right?
<otakon> Gummi: no it's not
<Ryunosuke> eli: I would say, if you are going to kill me, do it quick and painless, or else I will be VERY pissed off
<Gummi> I was jk...
<TheGentleManBrony> CAN WE ALL JUST CALM THE FUCK DOWN?!
<BaconMane> 0,5Everything alright in here?
<Ryunosuke> ohai BaconMane
<Gummi> yes yes
<Eli> Ryunosuke: problem is just i'm not gonna kill anyone.
<Buytoast> Everythig is terrible.
<Eli> BaconMane: all cool
<Gummi> BACOOOOOOOOON GOTTA GET SOME BACOOON
<Alchemist> BaconMane: HELP... US....!!!!

<BaconMane> 0,5TheGentleManBrony, Cthulu, etc, I'm keeping my eyes on you. And anyone else who was being a dousche over this.
<Alchemist> I dont think I've ever owned an apple product.
<Wrek> 05mer eller mindre
<TheGentleManBrony> I wasn't being a douche. I said one douchey thing.
<Ryunosuke> i have itunes, does that count?

<Wrek> 05spammers
<Ryunosuke> okay
<CTHULHU> im a asshole not a dousche
<Gummi> (insert meme here)
<Lil_B> Ryunosuke I guess that that's what they were going fore... but seriously, I would prefer iJobs over jObs
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> TheGentleManBrony: Which could be the worst thing you could say to parents who lost their kids...asshole
<BaconMane> 0,5Keep it up, my trigger finger is itchy.
<Buytoast> Enough already.
<BaconMane> 0,5Or in this case, my boot.
*Eli is shot by BaconMane
<Ryunosuke> let me ask this eli, is it okay to play CoD, PS2, Halo or any other FPS that simulates a combat situation? :)
<Gummi> Babs seed a bully and a bitch babs seed babs seed

<TheGentleManBrony> Fuck
<TheGentleManBrony> now I want bacon
<Eli> Ryunosuke: I don't. but if you want to... do it. can't stop you
<BaconMane> 0,5Enough.

<Lil_B> Wrek I think it's strange that he only got 1 Oscar in his career. For the Lion King Soundtrack
<Eli> I think that trailer is fake tho... Gummi
<Meanwhile> Hans Zimmer is brilliant.
<Lil_B> ^
<SpeccyRush> Meanwhile, 'least you didn't fall asleep while doing the survey
<Alchemist> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy4iQvJo24U By hans zimmer

<TheGentleManBrony> Heeere branches branches branches
<Meanwhile> SpeccyRush: Skills.
<Gummi> Hey guys ya think there will be a a mlp christmas themed episode?
<CTHULHU> there was

<TheGentleManBrony> Branches
<otakon> CTHULHU: no for this year
<Alchemist> Gummi: I dont think so. We already had one and I dont think they play the same card twice.
<otakon> that was last years
<TheGentleManBrony> Branches are best pony
<Lil_B> yeah, Hans Zimmer also made some Game Soundtracks, or at least made the Main Themes
<otakon> Branches?
<TheGentleManBrony> I vote for pony named branches
<CTHULHU> oh then no
<Alchemist> Lil_B: Yeah, people can hate COD:MW2 all they like, the theme was still awesome.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AohFNsu-pWA
<Lil_B> he worked on Modern Warfire 2, Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure
<Eli> Alchemist: that's what I like to say about FFXIII
<Lil_B> Alchemist I like that they got some Indie-Game Music Guys in the Blacvk-Ops II Soundtrack
<ouo_ewe> COD? Maybe you meen ME3
<Alchemist> Eli: I only played FF4 and I didnt complete it.
<Gummi> F*ck yeah to Sonic themes
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> A good theme doesnt nessicarily make a game good
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sonic 06 had good music, it was still shit
<Lil_B> ouo_ewe nope, Hans Zimmer worked on COD:MW2
<otakon> I will admit that Sonic does usually have GREAT music
<Alchemist> ouo_ewe: he made the theme for me, cod, crysis 2
<Eli> Alchemist: the FF music is quite epic in all of them. you should check it out
<Gummi> 5 hours till the movie?
<Gummi> wow -_-
<Lil_B> Well, the FF13 and 13-2 Music is... well produced, but I can't find some charm in it :/
<Gummi> I'll be in bed by that time.
<Wrek> 05i might aswell stream something then
<Eli> Gummi: i take it you're from europe too then?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Live and Learn is best Sonic music
<Gummi> yes
<Alchemist> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: thats true, but people usually go all in and if they jump on the hate bandwagon they know no boundaries.
<Gummi> yet all of you speak english
<CTHULHU> si
<Eli> Gummi: duh.
<Gummi> Well i guess i'm the only kid
<Gummi> :/
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sonic 06 is the only game that anyone can hate and I have no qualms about it
<Buytoast> usually dissapointing things have good music
<Eli> Gummi: Ich könnte schon Deutsch reden, but that would suck
<Buytoast> like Sticker Star

<Wrek> 05also
<Mattcrowley2a> I am feeling very good today.
<Chrysalis> ikr
<Mattcrowley2a> How about everyone else?
<Wrek> 05ouo_ewe: no more saucy
<CTHULHU> meh
<Alchemist> Lil_B: I "bought" my copy via a third party software from youtube :)
<Mattcrowley2a> Wrek, you used to stream video games on the stream, as far as I remember when I last came here.
<Lil_B> Alchemist ahhh xD I used to do that 2 years ago, but the Quality Loss I get via Youtube compression and downloading that is something I wanted to start avoiding :)
<killerpony7733> Wrek Isn't E621 very not to be linked unless you only got the image and not a said page like that?
<Kandarihu> Mattcrowley2a, he does Planetside sometimes
<Eli> Mattcrowley2a: they all stream various things. Wrek sometimes streams games and sometimes the most amazing art
<Mattcrowley2a> Thanks, both of you.
<YokusaHHart> dat metal
<Eli> Mattcrowley2a: and sometimes somethinglike that
<Alchemist> Lil_B: many people say that the quality is mediocre at best. Luckily for me I dont have a good ear for music and I dont really hear the difference :D
<Wrek> 05killerpony7733: it was still a safe image
<Dragonmatte> Alchemist: Me neither, hehe :D
<soulrider95> nothing can beat the feeling of a good guitar solo
<YokusaHHart> btw what band is this?
<soulrider95> Sabaton
<Alchemist> I can play around with the presets in the media player (equalizer, effects etc) and it sounds good enough for me.
<Mattcrowley2a> Dat headbang!
<CTHULHU> we need some blind guardian
<Lil_B> Alchemist My Setup isn't the best eather, but I alöso just dislike the way I had to copy and paste ALL the Links there one-by-one and when it stopped on one song, I could repeat everything :/
<Mattcrowley2a> Looks like a concert actively going.
<Alchemist> Lil_B: you couldnt make a playlist of the downloaded songs?
*Kipkat07_USAF missed school :'(
<ouo_ewe> http://derpiboo.ru/182646
<Lil_B> Alchemist that would also have taken rather long, I'm just better of finding the Album I want somewhere else and downloading it
<Alchemist> ouo_ewe: thats slightly odd :D
<Wrek> 05forgot to hide the 18 tag
<ouo_ewe> yeup i think so.. :)
<MadSurge> Ooo concert! Who are these guys Wrek?
<Gummi> nothing better to do
<CTHULHU> Sabaton
<Mattcrowley2a> Wrek, how have you been?
<MadSurge> Welp thanks oh powerful CTHULHU! :D

<Wrek> 05so awesome
<CTHULHU> meh
<Lil_B> Invi A 15min talk, with GEMA and Youtube Persons about why they don't get along with it, finally, I hope I'll get answers!
<Lil_B> Invi in german!
<Invi> Lil_B, since GEMA is a only german instutute: duh german ^^

<Lil_B> Invi JA!
<Record_Discord> cachi01|phone: You know it
<CTHULHU> really a keytar?
<Wrek> 05mhm
<CTHULHU> thats not metal
<LadyCanary> Is this Stalingrad?
<Invi> Lil_B... are you tryin to tell me that it is leaving youtube alone?
<LadyCanary> And welcome to power metal CTHULHU
<Lil_B> Invi no... unfortunatly :/
<Invi> is there hope in the future?
<ouo_ewe> Stalingrad wat
<CTHULHU> not a lot of power metal band use keytars
<Everlasting_Joy> CTHULHU: ...And?
<Wrek> 05probably why sabaton are so damned good
<cachi01|phone> Well this one does
<CTHULHU> just saying

<LadyCanary> Well, different. That's what they are.
<cachi01|phone> Well this one does
<Record_Discord> CTHULHU: I'd like to disagree with you.
<otakon> bbl, Dragonborn is calling me
<cachi01|phone> Deal with it
<Lil_B> Invi can't say yet... ... damn, its more than 30 min of talking... and probably still no solution at the end :/
<LadyCanary> I have never seen a band that loves their fans so much, and puts so much fun and effort into their shows.
<CTHULHU> blind guardian is better
<LadyCanary> Well that's your opinion.
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<ouo_ewe> wat i did now?!
<cachi01|phone> otakon i need to play that dlc. I've only seen my brother playing it
<Wrek> 05CTHULHU: really you gona pull that old cliche?
<Wrek> 05*sigh*
<otakon> cachi01|phone: it's pretty good
<Invi> Lil_B, well GEMA is a political institution; meaning: much talk, no meaning, no action
<otakon> okay out for now
<CTHULHU> what cliche?
<LadyCanary> DREAM THEATER uses keyboards.
<LadyCanary> And they are fan fucking tastic.
<Lil_B> Invi nope, there is action, it's just the wrong action
<Wrek> 05the "X is better."
<Wrek> 05because its subjective
<Wrek> 05it doesnt matter
<Shizuka> 13but
<Shizuka> 13wub is better
<cachi01|phone> Butt
<Invi> Lil_B, what are they going to do?
<Wrek> 05or atleast is redundant
<Shizuka> 13canary knows this :3
<cachi01|phone> Wut
<Lil_B> Invi I stopped listening to it now, it's incedebly boring :/
