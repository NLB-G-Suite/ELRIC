<Ascendant> I was impressed that you did it so quickly
<Ascendant> lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03but that still takes effort
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm sure there's a way to crack activation on Vista/7
<drfsupercenter> 03but I don't see a point given that I can just abuse the phone system
<drfsupercenter> 03it still falls for "yes it's only on 1 PC"
<Ascendant> lmaaaao
<drfsupercenter> 03well, XP does that too
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't use the activation crack on my real machines
<drfsupercenter> 03I just phone it
<drfsupercenter> 03but for VMs, I'm lazy and just crack it
<Xanbreon> This is why I use MSDNA keys
<Xanbreon> woo
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03considering I've made and deleted about 10 XP VMs today alone
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd run out of keys
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Ascendant> rofl
<drfsupercenter> 03don't ask why, I'm testing crap
<Xanbreon> They are not multiple activation keys?
<Xanbreon> O-o
<drfsupercenter> 03MSDNAA, nope
<drfsupercenter> 03one time use
<drfsupercenter> 03they're retail keys.
<Xanbreon> lawl
<drfsupercenter> 03TechNet works 10 times
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's still only 10 times, not infinite
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03they work infinitely on that one machine...
<Ascendant> WBV29-DP2KM-MKTXM-CTCDB-MCJ28
<Ascendant> u jelly?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what is that
<drfsupercenter> 03XP?
<Xanbreon> I have one thats thousands of activations or something
<Ascendant> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a Win7 enterprise
<drfsupercenter> 03that works for 500
<Ascendant> or
<drfsupercenter> 03also you know what amuses me?
<drfsupercenter> 03I got this Windows XP Corporate edition (which, is just VLK version, but pirates are stupid)
<drfsupercenter> 03this dude I know on IRC actually stole it from his work, right
<drfsupercenter> 03that key is blacklisted now
<drfsupercenter> 03but a key I got off some random chinese forum isn't
<drfsupercenter> 03and all I did was google "XP VLK key" LOL
<Ascendant> TBTDF-AMQGH-66MW7-X929V-8KHG0
<Ascendant> that's my dead laptop's one
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but try to actually activate it
<drfsupercenter> 03it prolly wosn't work
<drfsupercenter> 03-s
<Ascendant> maybe
<Ascendant> Anyway
*Ascendant goes to heat up her pizza
<Ascendant> And thank you so much drf :p
<drfsupercenter> 03np
*Ascendant poofs
<Ascendant> okay
<Ascendant> so
<Ascendant> drf
<Ascendant> you
<Ascendant> should probably get your server sometime
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03when I figure out which one I want to get
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm debating between that french one or hentzer
<drfsupercenter> 03or w/e
<Ascendant> hetzner's expensive though
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03it's more than double the price
<drfsupercenter> 03wait
<drfsupercenter> 03not more than double
<drfsupercenter> 03but almost
<Ascendant> as for the french one
<Ascendant> you need to check
<Ascendant> whether they accept international transactions
<drfsupercenter> 03if not I can just prod a guy in France
<Ascendant> lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03I think we have a couple on hoshient
<drfsupercenter> 03*net
<Ascendant> hetzner requires a CC
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I was going to pay them in cash
*drfsupercenter hides
<Ascendant> roffffffffl
<Ascendant> yeah, hey hetzner, what's your address again? I need to mail you the payment for this month
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, PayPal is preferred but w/e
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> yay 600 mb to go
<Xanbreon> You might need to send your passport info or something like that for a dedi
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf
<drfsupercenter> 03never heard of that o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03well the French one she showed me

<Xanbreon> >blame windows
<Xanbreon> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd totally get this Hetzner server but it's really fricking expensive
<Ascendant> drfffffffffff help
<drfsupercenter> 03I have no idea :/
<Ascendant> have a look anyway?
<drfsupercenter> 03it doesn't give any errors or anything?
<Xanbreon> They are actually pretty cheap
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Xanbreon> As far as dedi go
<drfsupercenter> 03¬Ä50 a month
<drfsupercenter> 03is way over my budget
<drfsupercenter> 03even 30 was pushing it
<Xanbreon> Your budget is to small for what you want
<Ascendant> it doesn't give errors at all drf
<drfsupercenter> 03well that server is way overkill
<Ascendant> it just does the "steam is loading game" thing
<drfsupercenter> 03I only need like 2GB of RAM, not 16
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Xanbreon> Pick a random old dedi from there auction site
<drfsupercenter> 03those are still fairly expensive though
<Xanbreon> some for 30euros afaik
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but for what you get it sucks
<Ascendant> volumedrive.com
<Ascendant> urgh
<Ascendant> how the hell do you get this game to play
<Xanbreon> Did you lose your ability to google?
<Ascendant> I tried
<Ascendant> hm
<Ascendant> could be the firewall but I doubt it
<Xanbreon> What version is it?
<junh1024-XD> gfx card?
<Xanbreon> If it doesnt say, left click on the exe and properties
<Ascendant> of steam?
<Xanbreon> Of the game
<Ascendant> uh
<Ascendant> let me find it first
<Xanbreon> Steam\steamapps\common
<Ascendant> doesn't say any version
<Xanbreon> Properties on the exe, and the details tab?
<Ascendant> ah hah!
<drfsupercenter> 03hm yeah the cheapest ones that would even work have 2x300GB HDD and are like ¬Ä32
<Ascendant> I tried
<drfsupercenter> 032.2GHz single core, 2GB RAM
<Ascendant> put it as windows xp mode
<Ascendant> now gives the d3dx9 dll error
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03This is why I hate PC gaming
<drfsupercenter> 03consoles jsut work :P
<Xanbreon> Download and install the dx9 redistro
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> the fawk
<Ascendant> the sdk is 500mb
*Ascendant just looks for the dll
<Xanbreon> Not the sdk you derp
<Xanbreon> http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=35
<Ascendant> yeah I found that already
<Xanbreon> Just use that
<Ascendant> screw you microsoft
<Ascendant> I don't want your extra bs
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Ascendant> 100mb? o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03Operating system: Delivered in Rescue System <- does that mean I can install whatever I wsant?
<drfsupercenter> 03*want
<Xanbreon> Yes
<drfsupercenter> 03nice
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean I suppose that's not too terrible
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like ¬Ä32 or 33
<drfsupercenter> 03but still, for only a single core with 2GB of DDR 400MHz? eh
<drfsupercenter> 03still expensive x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway brb, need to reboot
<Ascendant> k
<Xanbreon> dedi's are expensive
<Ascendant> indeeed
<Ascendant> inded
<Ascendant> indeed
<Ascendant> urgh
<Ascendant> can't type
<Ascendant> yaaaay it works
<Xanbreon> First thing todo on a win vista or 7 install is to install the dx9 redistro
<Xanbreon> As ms doesnt bundle all the dlls

<Pattyrick> W00T, 3G with Vodafone Espania :D
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Umbreon> HyperMetalLugia i'm back
<Umbreon> i think i aced the linux test :D
<Umbreon> i got to admit
<Umbreon> bash gave me a headache
<Umbreon> perl gave me more of a headache
<Umbreon> then c gave me an even worse headache
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<Umbreon> if it wasn't open book
<Umbreon> i would have certainly perished
<Umbreon> i remember the commands and such
<Umbreon> i just don't remember the punctuation sort of speak
<Umbreon> like some things need to be put in ()s and somethings need to be put on a new line
<Umbreon> c i didn't understand how you introduce variables
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<HyperMetalLugia> aww
<Umbreon> oh well
<Umbreon> since shell script was so basic
<Umbreon> it was probably the easiest for me
<Umbreon> bash
<Umbreon> perl is kind of like javascript except you use $ to say "this is a variable"
<Umbreon> c i have no clue
<Umbreon> at least it was a simple program
<Umbreon> "ask user to enter 2 numbers, then add the numbers together and display that sum"

<gnastygnorc97> yo
<Umbreon> hi pancake
<Pattyrick> Hi floofbreon
<Pattyrick> How are you?
<Umbreon> i'm ok
<Pattyrick> So Linux was hard?
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, it makes little sense
<Umbreon> yes it is
<Umbreon> but microsoft is harder
<Umbreon> i actually passed the linux test
<Pattyrick> Hmm
<SilverSonic|Android> Lololol
<Umbreon> so in your face HyperMetalLugia
<Umbreon> linux is easier
<HyperMetalLugia> only because
<HyperMetalLugia> it was open book
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Umbreon> excuses
<Umbreon> to be honest
<Umbreon> i probably would have failed the microsoft test even if it was open book
<Umbreon> because the book stinks
<Umbreon> it doesn't get to the point and strays around the corner
<Umbreon> it's not concise enough
<Pattyrick> What exactly were you tested on?
<SilverSonic|Android> Umbreon hates windows?
<Umbreon> i don't hate windows
<Umbreon> i hate windows classes
<Umbreon> because they go so far in depth of the operating system
<Umbreon> most people have a basic concept of windows so they make you go super far into the systems features
<SilverSonic|Android> Isnt that what they are supposed to do?
<SilverSonic|Android> Go in depth
<Umbreon> linux class, not many people know linux so they only touch the surface
<Umbreon> SilverSonic i agree
<Umbreon> but you should take it step by step
<Umbreon> not go off the deep end right away
<HyperMetalLugia> What do they ask?
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Umbreon> HyperMetalLugia
<Umbreon> wanna go over the questions in the test i got wrong?
<Umbreon> i just pulled up the test
<Umbreon> so XD
<HyperMetalLugia> do it
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Umbreon> 	
<Umbreon> A group‚Äôs scope refers to the types of domain controllers present in the environment.
<Umbreon> T or F
<Umbreon> i got that wrong
<HyperMetalLugia> is it T?
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Umbreon> i answered T
<Umbreon> so no, it's not True
<Umbreon> The first steps in a general strategy for implementing groups in an environment is to create user accounts and organize them into domain local groups.
<Umbreon> true or false
<HyperMetalLugia> false again?
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<Umbreon> correct
<Umbreon> i answered true XD
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> set up the groups first
<HyperMetalLugia> then add users
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<Umbreon> it depends -.-
<HyperMetalLugia> Next question
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Umbreon> you need to add accounts before anything else
<Umbreon> if you have no users, you won't have a general idea of what groups need to be made
<Umbreon> Effective permissions are determined by the cumulative share and security permissions, not the cumulative share and cumulative security permissions evaluated individually.
<Umbreon> and of course i got lost in the wording of that statement
<SilverSonic|Android> O.o
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
<Umbreon> true or false
<HyperMetalLugia> well
<HyperMetalLugia> seems to be true?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;<
<HyperMetalLugia> I bet it is false
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Umbreon> no
<Umbreon> it's false
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> well the wording
<Umbreon> see
<Umbreon> stupid teacher :P
<HyperMetalLugia> wtf are they asking
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<Umbreon> sorry with the multiple choice portion
<HyperMetalLugia> CULMAgtIVIErjgfjdnf
<Umbreon> i don't have access to all the choices given
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Umbreon> only what i answered
<Umbreon> NTFS permissions can be set at which of the following? (choose the best answer)
<Umbreon> i answered partition level and apparently that was wrong
<Umbreon> i think the other choices was file level
<Umbreon> directory level
<Umbreon> and share level
<HyperMetalLugia> file level
<HyperMetalLugia> makes sense
<HyperMetalLugia> But
<HyperMetalLugia> Share evel maybe
<HyperMetalLugia> though
<Umbreon> NTFS is a file system
<HyperMetalLugia> you can set folder permissions
<HyperMetalLugia> file permissions
<Umbreon> not a blasted type of permission
<HyperMetalLugia> lOL
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<Umbreon> When a user accesses a file locally, and there are both NTFS and share permissions on the file, which permissions are actually used?
<HyperMetalLugia> permissions FOR the file system
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<HyperMetalLugia> UHwaut
<HyperMetalLugia> Uh, I suppose the network permission?
<HyperMetalLugia> I guess ovo
<Umbreon> now you know why he irritates me?
<HyperMetalLugia> Why?
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Umbreon> this teacher
<Umbreon> the questions are so concepty
<Umbreon> The minimum password age policy defines the number of days that a password must be used before a user is allowed to change it.
<Umbreon> true or false
<Xanbreon> Depends if they are accessing it locally or remotely O-o
<Xanbreon> Or, theres stuff about ownership as well
<Umbreon> the best part about this question
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Umbreon> it contradicts a question in the test that i got right
<Umbreon> Which of the following password policy items defines the number of days that a password can be used before the user is required to change it?
<Umbreon> i answered "maximum password age"
<Umbreon> and got it right
<HyperMetalLugia> uh
<Xanbreon> Thats just derp
<HyperMetalLugia> max = min
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> isn't
<HyperMetalLugia> but blah
<HyperMetalLugia> crazy teachers
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Umbreon> so i looked at that true or false question and thought "well if this question is right then that question has to be false"
<Umbreon> nope
<Umbreon> it was a true statement
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Bututut
<HyperMetalLugia> bfjdfn
<Umbreon> basically
<Umbreon> one question says one thing
<Umbreon> then the other question says something completely different
<Umbreon> A group's ____ refers to the logical boundary within which a group can be assigned permissions to a specific resource within an Active Directory domain or forest.
<Umbreon> that was short answer
<Umbreon> i had to type the answer into a textbox
<Umbreon> any guesses? because i have no clue
<Umbreon> should i continue?
<Umbreon> i see i exploded both the brains of HyperMetalLugia and Xanbreon
<Pattyrick> Explosion
<Pattyrick> Espa√±a
<Pattyrick> Espa√±ol
<Pattyrick> Pla√ßa San YOMAMA
<Umbreon> :D
<Umbreon> Pattyrick how did you know i have an explosion VGC team XD
<Umbreon> actually it's my current VGC team
<Pattyrick> My brain hasn't exploded yet
<Umbreon> i try to wipe away the opposing team's start by helping handing a metagross and exploding them
<Umbreon> i just wish there was a ghost pokemon who could learn helping hands
<Pattyrick> Mostly because I've been not reading every single question
<Pattyrick> *runs*
<Umbreon> XD
<Xanbreon> What
<Umbreon> Xanbreon
<Umbreon> i'm trying to show HML that windows is much more harder than linux
<Umbreon> :P
<Xanbreon> I dont know anything about AD
<Xanbreon> Ones not harder than the other
<Xanbreon> Just diff
<Umbreon> nor do i apparently
<Xanbreon> gui vs cli
<Pattyrick> IDK, majikz probably
<Umbreon> XD
<Pattyrick> I know everything about many roller coasters, sorta
<Umbreon> :)
<Umbreon> i think we are done here
<Umbreon> waiting for my new DSi carrying case to come out of the dryer
<Umbreon> still not sure if i'd use it though
<Umbreon> because it'd be too easy to rip it off of you

<Umbreon> whee
<Umbreon> game boy case all washed up
<Pattyrick> Somebody had a GameBoy case on their phone at the Vodafone store
<Pattyrick> It was pretty awesome
<Umbreon> i'm using it for my DSi
<Umbreon> XD
<Umbreon> at regionals
<Pattyrick> Nice
<Umbreon> i found it randomly in my room
<Umbreon> tested it out
<Umbreon> fits the DSi quite nicely
<Umbreon> it was covered in dust and such
<Umbreon> so i put it through the wash
<Umbreon> didn't turn out too bad
<Umbreon> found a picture of it in amazon
<Umbreon> http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pikachu-Game-Color-Pocket-Advance/dp/B003QH6012
<Pattyrick> Cool
<Umbreon> yeah
<Umbreon> too bad it didn't get much time with the fabric softener thing
<Umbreon> when i opened the dryer
<Pattyrick> I have a Venusaur LG one
<Umbreon> i noticed the fabric softener sheet got caught in the lint collector somehow
<Umbreon> Quanyails~~
<Quanyails> 7Hai.
<Pattyrick> Hi Quan
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Pat. :)
<Quanyails> 7How's that Absol?
<Pattyrick> Good
<Pattyrick> Thanks for the new moves :3
<Quanyails> 7Sucker Punching everything? :P
<Quanyails> 7Welcome.
<Umbreon> :D
<Pattyrick> Haven't used it much yet, but Zoroark will need a break soon
<Umbreon> this explosion team won't work
<Umbreon> metagross is too common
<Quanyails> 7Explosion team? X3
<Umbreon> yes
<Umbreon> metagross, cobalion, garchomp, charizard
<Quanyails> 7Doubles?
<Umbreon> VGC 12
<Pattyrick> I'm at Kyuurem
<Umbreon> so yeah
<Quanyails> 7I'm Hmming at Charizard.
<Pattyrick> Should I use my Master Ball on it?
<Umbreon> cobalion uses helping hands
<Quanyails> 7Pat: If you'd like.
<Quanyails> 7But you can catch it without.
<Umbreon> metagross uses explosion and takes out their pokemon
<Umbreon> and cobalion still survives
<Quanyails> 7Weeell, Protect can help with that.
<Umbreon> i know
<Umbreon> what doesn't protect help against though
<Quanyails> 7What are you using Charizard exactly for in Doubles?
<Pattyrick> Hmm
<Pattyrick> I,m contemplating it because it was stubborn to get in an Ultra Ball even with a burn
<Quanyails> 7Dusk Balls?
<Umbreon> heat wave user
<Quanyails> 7Okaaay, but it's rather mediocre as one. :/
<Umbreon> and doesn't get pounded by garchomp's earthquake
<Quanyails> 7Zapdos or Chandelure work.
<Umbreon> zapdos was considered
<Umbreon> but it doesn't STAB heat wave
<Quanyails> 7It can get Discharge. :P
<Umbreon> and i think i calculated that zapdos and garchomp have a common weakness
<Quanyails> 7Which is common, but effective.
<Quanyails> 7Ice.
<Quanyails> 7So Blizzard = D:
<Umbreon> yeah
<Umbreon> there is no common weaknes upon charizard and garchomp so yeah
<Umbreon> it's an okay core
<Pattyrick> Hmm
<Umbreon> even if charizard is a bit to be required for stats
<Pattyrick> Perhaps that'll help
<Pattyrick> Since it be a cavemon
<Umbreon> too bad i probably can't get a dream world charizard
<Umbreon> that ability is interesting as heck
<Quanyails> 7Sun in Doubles, hmm?
<Umbreon> i probably won't make a weather team
<Umbreon> in the end i'll have a counter tema
<Umbreon> team
<Umbreon> to fight off the 4 most popular pokemon
<Umbreon> according to a PO server's statistics that majors in VGC
<Umbreon> so that would be...
<Umbreon> From 01/02 - 01/08
<Umbreon> -----------------------------------
<Umbreon> 13530 battles
<Umbreon> # 1 - Zapdos (22.49 %)
<Umbreon> # 2 - Latios (19.85 %)
<Umbreon> # 3 - Metagross (19.09 %)
<Umbreon> # 4 - Hitmontop (18.87 %)
<Angel_Espeon> 13!chatstats
<Angel_Espeon> 13not working? D:
<Umbreon> :<
<Umbreon> poor thing
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Quanyails> 7Well, Ice does work there.
<Umbreon> i heard toast rotom is really awesome against zapdos
<Umbreon> XD
<Quanyails> 7...toast?
<Umbreon> yes
<Umbreon> heat
<Quanyails> 7Funny way of saying it, but yes.
<Umbreon> watching some videos
<Quanyails> 7Resists Fire/Electric/Ice. :P
<Quanyails> 7And Nidoking.
<Umbreon> and can hit back pretty neatly
<Umbreon> lol
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Quanyails> 7Unfortunately, Heat Rotom's weak to Surf and Rock Slide.
<Quanyails> 7A Drizzle-based team might not fare well for that. :/
<Quanyails> 7But you can't cover absolutely everything. X.x
<Umbreon> i know
<Umbreon> heat rotom is weak to 3 of the most common spread moves
<Quanyails> 7Three?
*Quanyails 7missed one? o.O
<Umbreon> well
<Umbreon> i guess i forgot about levitate
<Umbreon> fine if it somehow loses levitate then it's weak to earthquake as well
<Umbreon> XD
<Quanyails> 7Okaaay. :P
<Umbreon> i need to make an excel sheet
<Umbreon> that will analyze a moveset
<Quanyails> 7For?
<Umbreon> and will look at every type and tally up what you have weakness coverage of
<Quanyails> 7Psypokes has one.
<Umbreon> and what could possibly wall that moveset
<Quanyails> 7http://www.psypokes.com/dex/atktypeanalysis.php

<Umbreon> i'll have to keep that in mind XD
<Quanyails> 7Mmmhmm. :)
<Umbreon> i'm bookmarking that
<Pattyrick> I guess 3G is blah here in Spain, too :\
<Pattyrick> 0__o
<Quanyails> 7O__o?
<Pattyrick> Yes
<Pattyrick> *wonders what Umbreon is bookmarking*
<Xanbreon> prawns
<Xanbreon> prawn on prawn action
<Umbreon> what Quanyails linked
<Umbreon> of course :P
<Pattyrick> Oh
<Umbreon> having the tool premade
<Umbreon> saves me a lot of work XD
<Pattyrick> Prawns
<Umbreon> thanks Quanyails XD
<Quanyails> 7Welcome. :)
<Umbreon> i just hope i can throw a team together in time for the tournament
<Umbreon> this was kind of a last minute thought
<Quanyails> 7You could always try for VGC13.
<Quanyails> 7I've planned my CPAC team since... well, since the last one ended. XD
<Umbreon> XD
<Umbreon> what is the rules for 13?
<Umbreon> Quanyails i'm pretty much making a statement with this VGC tournament
<Umbreon> i've played the TCG for 6-7 years
<Umbreon> maybe more (i've lost track)
<Umbreon> and i'm getting sick of the format being always the same formula
<Quanyails> 7Well, I'm not too sure.
<Quanyails> 7Only last year was there a restriction on non-certain-legendaries, I think.
*Quanyails 7checks.
<Umbreon> that's one thing
<Umbreon> at least they have a banlist
<Umbreon> the TCG doesn't have a ban list
<Pattyrick> I got a 10pack of Spanish cards today
<Umbreon> okay let's go over this
<Umbreon> this is a list of what got first place in state championships 2 weeks or so ago
<Umbreon> Zekrom/Eelektrik x24
<Umbreon> Celebi/Mewtwo/Tornadus x18
<Umbreon> Durant x4
<Umbreon> Landorus/Terrakion x3
<Umbreon> Donphan/Mewtwo x2
<Umbreon> Straight Celebi/Mewtwo x2
<Umbreon> Reshiphlosion x2
<Umbreon> x1 Victories:
<Umbreon> Straight Terrakion
<Umbreon> Magnezone/Eelektrik
<Umbreon> Terrakion/Tornadus
<Umbreon> Magneboar
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Umbreon> 59 decks
<Umbreon> 40% of them was won by one deck
<Umbreon> 7 of them were won by decks that are meant to beat that deck
<Umbreon> or 11%
<Umbreon> 51% of the format revolves around one deck in otherwords
<Quanyails> 7Centralization. O.o
<Umbreon> yes
<Umbreon> that's what the TCG has been for 3-4 years
<Umbreon> one deck takes hold of the format
<Umbreon> and you either play that deck
<Umbreon> or play something that beats it
<Quanyails> 7Doesn't sound very creative. X3
<Umbreon> exactly
<Umbreon> Quanyails worlds of 2008 i believe it was
<Umbreon> 80% of the players were playing the same deck
<Umbreon> that is no exageration, that was a true statistic
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Quanyails> 7X.x
<Umbreon> i'm getting sick of this pattern
<Quanyails> 7There's slightly more variety in VGCs. :)
<Umbreon> skarmbliss PO server
<Umbreon> the most popular pokemon is .... not even 25%
<Umbreon> i think it's 22% or something
<Umbreon> and guess what
<Quanyails> 7You're using none of them?
<Umbreon> i'm sure that in those 22% of the matches
<Umbreon> most of them weren't the same exact team
<Quanyails> 7Hence the difference in percentages.
<Umbreon> they aren't doing anything to fix the format either
<Umbreon> the next set is going to be an expansive set
<Umbreon> to only make the current popular decks even better
<MysticLugia> 02oh, you mean skarmbliss stall?
<Umbreon> no
<Umbreon> skarmbliss server
<MysticLugia> 02oh
<Umbreon> that's the name of the actual server
<Umbreon> but sure, they are named after the common skarmory blissey combo :P
<MysticLugia> 02yeah, that compo now does fear salamence now, since he isn¬¥t banned anymore
<Vanilla> owo
<Vanilla> hello
<Quanyails> 7Hey, Twilly. :D
<MysticLugia> 02heyo
<Vanilla> The chatbox on the forums won't work for me OTL
<Quanyails> 7Can't help you with that. :/
<Vanilla> It says I have to have a "profile" or something
<Vanilla> DX
<Pattyrick> Vanilla tastes good
<Vanilla> lol XP
<Umbreon> MysticLugia
<Umbreon> that combo was dead the second DP came out
<Umbreon> infernape rips them both to shreds
<MysticLugia> 02yeah forgot about infernape
<MysticLugia> 02he can mixedsweep too x3
<Umbreon> stab fire
<Umbreon> and stab fighting
<Umbreon> yes and that
<MysticLugia> 02you actually HAVE to mixed sweep for that, otherwise one of the other still fully can stall you with their (sp)defense unless you have a other pokemon to switch out for that
<Umbreon> lol
<Umbreon> oh well
<Umbreon> i think the tool Quanyails gave me
<Umbreon> will make things so much easier
<Umbreon> i just have to look at common movepools for the 3 most common pokemon and see what turns up
*Vanilla headdesks
<Umbreon> i misread that as helpdesks

<Light_Latias> 12what issue do you have in that?
<Light_Latias> 12...
<Light_Latias> 12it's as "stupid" as some of the more classic fairy tales
<drfsupercenter> 03my main issue with that is that it's an animated movie made since about 10 years ago that isn't DreamWorks or Pixar
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Light_Latias> 12that Disney made
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, it's not like I'm just refusing to watch movies and going "gee, I don't have any movies to watch"

<drfsupercenter> 03if you get Steam

<drfsupercenter> 03as that's one of the best 3 :/
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate the first 3 games, sure they were revolutionary but it's more like NES than SNES and the stupid sound effects are annoying
<drfsupercenter> 03the music is what made those games good. Same with most SNES games I think people would agree
<Syrune> I don't enjoy the original SNES/NES games for the music, more the nostalgia and fun memories.

<Syrune> Granted the music for them was fun and enjoyable.
<Syrune> But if you only play the game for it's soundtrack then there is no real point in playing it.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, but it's just not the same if you play SNES games on mute
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03depends on the game really.
<drfsupercenter> 03but stuff like Super Mario Bros
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't NOT like the music :P
<Syrune> DUDE, SMB WAS BEST
<drfsupercenter> 03but the Keen games, honestly, were revolutionary in terms of music for their day.
<Syrune> Still is
<Aurora> !roara
<Syrune> Aurora play dead!
<drfsupercenter> 03they came out in 1991, and had realy pro-sounding music, better than SNES
*Aurora dies
<drfsupercenter> 03if you've heard of Bobby Prince, he did the music for tem
<drfsupercenter> 03*Them
<Syrune> Hai Aurora :>
<drfsupercenter> 03but the first 3 Keen games had no music, only PC-speaker sound effects, it's basically...like listening to a dial-up modem while playing x.x

<drfsupercenter> 03for which systemsa?
<drfsupercenter> 03-a
<Syrune> SNES
<drfsupercenter> 03most NES games had music
<drfsupercenter> 03erm
<drfsupercenter> 03SNES, even
<drfsupercenter> 03here let me find an example of the original Keens
<drfsupercenter> 03but what's amazing
<drfsupercenter> 03is Keen 1-3 were 1990
<drfsupercenter> 03and 4-6 were 1991
<Syrune> I loved a TON of the music from the NES, I even own some of the original tracks.
<drfsupercenter> 03Keen 4-6 had twice the resolution, actual music... etc

<drfsupercenter> 03Just one year later
<drfsupercenter> 03much better graphics, and actual catchy music
<HyperMetalLugia> that is weird :|
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I prefer 4-6
<HyperMetalLugia> with dosbox
<drfsupercenter> 03over the first 3 :P
<HyperMetalLugia> I thought I installed
<HyperMetalLugia> the first ima
<HyperMetalLugia> but it does nothing
<HyperMetalLugia> it doesn't even ask me for disk 2
<drfsupercenter> 03did you run install.bat?
<Syrune> Well drf, a lot of games changed the music quite eratically in short periods of time.
<HyperMetalLugia> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03but my point being
<HyperMetalLugia> It said "Done"
<drfsupercenter> 03I have a legit reason for liking 4-6 better
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Syrune> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03plus, I grew up playing 5 and 6
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<HyperMetalLugia> It made a directory too
<drfsupercenter> 03*4 and 6
<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't even know about 1-3
<drfsupercenter> 03as they don't actually use the numbers
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just called Commander Keen: Secrets of the Oracle or whatever
<drfsupercenter> 03it wasn't until much later I realized there were more.
<Syrune> I still remember the NES versions of Final Fantasy, the soundtracks on them cpmpared to the SNES ones. Major difference in sound.
<Syrune> Despite them being like
<Syrune> 6-18 months apart.

<drfsupercenter> 03it's LaCie
<HyperMetalLugia> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03but they happen to use Seagate
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Syrune> Windows 7 doesn't like SeaGate HDD's
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm not sure what my lacie is
<HyperMetalLugia> But I haven't had a problem at all
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03well, Seagate is a crappy brand either way
<Syrune> Depends
<Syrune> I have an old 40GB Seagate HDD
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, OLD
<drfsupercenter> 03but ever since like 2005
<drfsupercenter> 03or so
<drfsupercenter> 03they suck
<Syrune> Almost 5 years old, still working perfectly
<drfsupercenter> 03erm, OK
<Syrune> And my 1TB External is a Seagate (Granted it's almost dead >.>) but it's lasted almost 3 years.
<Syrune> 2 or 3 years, I dunno, can't rememeber when I bought it.
<Syrune> Point is, Seagate is an OK brand for Harddrives.
<drfsupercenter> 03if OK means "I know this drive is going to break and am just waiting for that day" then sure
<Syrune> Like every HDD
<Syrune> No matter the brand.
<Syrune> They all die eventually.
<drfsupercenter> 03WDs tend to last longer though
<drfsupercenter> 03and less random dying at a very early stage
<drfsupercenter> 03like this one which I literally ust got 2 hours ago.
<drfsupercenter> 03*just
<junh1024-XD> i think it's just your luck
<Syrune> ^
<Syrune> Anyway, as I said, Windows 7 hates Seagate drives.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<junh1024-XD> oh?
<drfsupercenter> 03I just plugged it into one of the university computers
<drfsupercenter> 03that runs XP
<drfsupercenter> 03still dead.
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll go yell at amazon for a replacement -_-
<Syrune> junh1024-XD: My 1TB External is a Seagate, windows 7 constantly says it's damaged and unreadable, yet my XP computer runs it perfectly.
<drfsupercenter> 03frick
<drfsupercenter> 03Amazon is out of stock
<drfsupercenter> 03so they can't give me a replacement
<drfsupercenter> 03x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03also Syrune, that's because Windows 7 actually *checks* the drives
<Rhiannyn> oh hi
<drfsupercenter> 03XP doesn't care, meaning you can have XP on a dying drive and it won't know
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03so basically your drive is probably about to die.
<Syrune> I already know that, don't need a OC to tell me that my drive is almost dead.
<Syrune> OS*
<drfsupercenter> 03well, not everybody is that smart
*Syrune shrugs
<drfsupercenter> 03for example, I had this boot drive, I was running Windows 7 when it popped up a "Your drive has reported issues, you should replace it"
<drfsupercenter> 03I would not have known otherwise as I don't regularly test my drives
<drfsupercenter> 03Just for kicks I installed XP on it
<drfsupercenter> 03didn't care at all
<drfsupercenter> 03I wouldn't have known and it woulda just died one day
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03but instead I got a replacement since it was still under warranty
<Syrune> XP is pro, doesn't care about anything 8D
<Syrune> Because at least with XP you get the chance to make backups of important files before the drive does die.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not that it didn't care, so much as it didn't know
<drfsupercenter> 03because XP didn't include SATA stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03IDE drives don't self-monitor
<drfsupercenter> 03So starting with Vista, it included the SATA/SMART drivers and would actually check
<drfsupercenter> 03and huh? Windows 7 doesn't stop you from using the drive before it dies
<Syrune> Basically microsofts way of saying they want more money :P
<drfsupercenter> 03it just tells you there's a problem with it
<drfsupercenter> 03you can just close the popup and be on your way LOL
<Syrune> Nope, not always
<drfsupercenter> 03weird
<drfsupercenter> 03for me it did
<Xanbreon> Im pretty damn sure S.M.A.R.T has been around for longer than SATA
<drfsupercenter> 03has it?
<drfsupercenter> 03I've never seen any IDE drives that did SMART reporting
<drfsupercenter> 03or rather
<drfsupercenter> 03any BIOSes that knew what that was
<Syrune> Can't even open my 1TB drive on Windows 7
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf?
<Xanbreon> Hmm, both standardised in the same year
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah that's what I thought
<Syrune> Windows 7 literally tells my external HDD to die in a fire.
<drfsupercenter> 03I haven't seen IDE drives and/or BIOSes for IDE motherboards that know what SMART is
<Syrune> Where as windows XP just goes "yep drive works, enjoy your files and shiz"
<Xanbreon> Well
<Xanbreon> There defo where IDE drives that had SMART built in
<drfsupercenter> 03but I don;'t think the motherboard knew how to handle it
<Xanbreon> http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/disk_smart_view.html
<Xanbreon> IDE/SATA disk.
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, so Xanbreon do you think this is a good price?
<drfsupercenter> 03Hardware details:
<drfsupercenter> 032x HDD 320 GB SATA
<drfsupercenter> 032x RAM 1024 MB DDR-400
<drfsupercenter> 03AMD Athlon 64 3700+
<drfsupercenter> 03Root Server SB 32
<drfsupercenter> 03Setup (once): 32.00 ¬Ä
<drfsupercenter> 03Price (monthly): 32.00 ¬Ä
<Xanbreon> Its cheap fore sure
<Xanbreon> Its not going to be a powerhouse though
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd prefer 4GB of RAM, but for some reason those ones are like ¬Ä45 a month or more
<MysticLugia> 02going to bed now
<drfsupercenter> 03which is a bit much of a price hike for 2GB of RAM...
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure why they're tiered like that
<drfsupercenter> 03literally exact same CPU and HDDs, just more RAM
<Rhiannyn> it is morning
<Rhiannyn> actually afternoon..
<Xanbreon> You know thats single core, right
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03all of them are, unless you wanna pay ¬Ä60+ a month
<Xanbreon> dedi's are expensive, however you cut it
<drfsupercenter> 03those ones literally cost more than the EX servers
<drfsupercenter> 03https://robot.your-server.de/order/market/sortcol/hd/sorttype/down/page/2
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm looking at the 2x320GB ones
<drfsupercenter> 03since oddly they're the same price as the 2x300GB
<drfsupercenter> 03so yay 40GB more
<Ray> 02Well, Nini everyone~
<Xanbreon> Theres some x2's with hwr for 38euro
<drfsupercenter> 03really?
<drfsupercenter> 03oh yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03I see those
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Xanbreon> pair of 320's though
<drfsupercenter> 03when they say hardware RAID, do they let you pick the config?
<drfsupercenter> 03as I'd rather just not have RAID
<drfsupercenter> 03and have two standalond drives
<Xanbreon> Thats not a very smart idea
<drfsupercenter> 03why not?
<Xanbreon> At least on RAID1 you will be able to limp around until you can get a HDD swapped
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually need most of that space so if I were to use RAID I'd need like 2x500
<Xanbreon> Your budget is to small for a sane server config =/
<Xanbreon> I really dont get what you want all that space for
<Xanbreon> I mean, wares, woo
<drfsupercenter> 03for using as a seedbox.
<drfsupercenter> 03I need to seed some torrents to boost my ratios
<drfsupercenter> 03at sites
<drfsupercenter> 03so I gotta tsore the fiels somewhere
<drfsupercenter> 03*store
<drfsupercenter> 03also hm
<drfsupercenter> 03with those server bidding things, would they replace a drive if it dies?
<drfsupercenter> 03or is it one of those "do what you want, we won't do w/e"
<drfsupercenter> 03...holy crap
<Xanbreon> yeh, you get replacement hardware if it dies
<drfsupercenter> 03some airplane is flying REALLY LOW above my dorm
<drfsupercenter> 03it's loud as frick
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think that's safe for it to be that low
<Xanbreon> inb4 crash crash boom
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I hope not
<drfsupercenter> 03at least not anywhere near me
<drfsupercenter> 03it can crash somewhere else :/
<Xanbreon> ".. and that was the last time we heard from drfsupercenter.."
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Xanbreon> Are you going to seed *that* many torrents at once though?
<Xanbreon> I mean, a few popular ones should keep your ratio up
<Xanbreon> And have you considered that buying a dedi to use as a seedbox is a bad idea
<Xanbreon> Why not just buy a seedbox and vps?
<Syrune> I gave up on Ratio's on torrent sites that require it.
<Xanbreon> >__<
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03Where does one buy a seedbox
<Syrune> lol...
<drfsupercenter> 03I just prefer one server that does it all
<drfsupercenter> 03well Syrune
<Xanbreon> One shoves seedbox into google
<drfsupercenter> 03the only torrents I really use anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03are HDBits, and What.cd
<drfsupercenter> 03both are elusive ratio trackers
<drfsupercenter> 03but they're *good* ones
<Xanbreon> dedi servers hosts are going to care more about torrents
<Syrune> Meh
<drfsupercenter> 03are they?
<drfsupercenter> 03OVH didn't give a crap
<drfsupercenter> 03they were like "here's your bandwidth, enjoy"
<Xanbreon> As in, you might wanna check the ToC
<Xanbreon> OVH have gone downhill
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah :/
<Xanbreon> To much crap on there network
<Syrune> Xanbreon: You have to check the ToC on most seedbox hosts nowadays.
<Xanbreon> Syrune, yeh always read the ToC
<drfsupercenter> 03why would seedboxes have ToC
<drfsupercenter> 03since basically all of them are going to be used for piracy
<Syrune> Anti-Piracy shiz
<drfsupercenter> 03that completely defeats the purpose >_>
<Xanbreon> So they dont get shutdown
<Syrune> What Xanbreon said.
<Xanbreon> You can get 100gig of space and tons of bandwith for $15 or less on a seedbox
<Xanbreon> 100gig+
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03do those give you a GUI and stuff or is it just some web interface like "click he3re to load your torrents"?
<Xanbreon> Generally a webui of some kind?
<Xanbreon> Dunno, never used one
<Syrune> It's all a WebUI
<drfsupercenter> 03meaing you just load the torrents through it?
<Syrune> Pretty much
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03but if they have ToS that say you can't do illegal stuff...
<Xanbreon> Its normally "dont do illegal stuff or we will terminate you, if we get dcma'ed"
<Xanbreon> Cover your arse crap
<Xanbreon> As seedboxes are basically only really used for piracy
<Syrune> That is all seedboxes are used for Xan XD
<Xanbreon> You could err
<Xanbreon> Seed your fav linux distro!111!
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 no, I';m going to seed some Linux distros
<drfsupercenter> 03from a seedbox
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL timing
<Xanbreon> 2late
<Xanbreon> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I did do that though
<drfsupercenter> 03at my old university
<Xanbreon> http://100tbh.com/SeedBox_Hosting.html
<drfsupercenter> 03they got all pissy about people torrenting
<drfsupercenter> 03like "stop being illegal"
<drfsupercenter> 03so I downloaded a bunch of Linux distros and seeded them
<Xanbreon> There you go, 100gig for 6euros
<drfsupercenter> 03like "Uh, I'm not being illegal"
<Xanbreon> you might have to try a few seedbox hosts, as they tend to be oversold
<drfsupercenter> 031GBiT Shared Connection (Maximum of 8) <- what does that mean
<drfsupercenter> 03maximum of 8?
<Xanbreon> 8 boxes per port
<Xanbreon> I just pulled them out of a google search
<Xanbreon> You would want reviews and <censored>
<Syrune> Not a bad host.
<Xanbreon> I mean some hosts even will give you a box for a day or so under trial
<Syrune> 100GB SATA II, with unlimited bandwidth and 8 boxes per port for 6 euros.
<drfsupercenter> 038 boxes per port? o.o
<Syrune> Pretty nifty
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm still not sure what that means
<Xanbreon> 8 seedboxes
<Xanbreon> on one port (connection)
<drfsupercenter> 03so it has nothing to dow ith me?
<drfsupercenter> 03more like "if more than 7 other people sign up, tough luck"?
<Xanbreon> So you are sharing your bandwith with 8 people
<Xanbreon> No >_<
<Xanbreon> Its contention ratio
<drfsupercenter> 03w/e
<drfsupercenter> 03problem is, I think hdbits and all that *may* ban seedboxes
<Xanbreon> You and 7 other people are sharing the 1gbit port
<drfsupercenter> 03as in, actual seedboxes
<drfsupercenter> 03if I use a dedi, it's just "my own computer"
<Xanbreon> They wouldnt do that
<Xanbreon> Cos that would be retarded
<Xanbreon> Why would they care how you got your ratio?
<Syrune> Ratio based torrent sites that ban seedboxes are pathetic.
<Xanbreon> ^

<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Xanbreon> And if you basically just want a vps for statbot
<Xanbreon> You could get away with a 8euro/month kvm box
<drfsupercenter> 03I know both of the sites I use have very specific torrent clients
<drfsupercenter> 03that are whitelisted
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not JUST for that
<drfsupercenter> 03I need a web server too
<drfsupercenter> 03and I have about 90GB of files so far :P
<drfsupercenter> 03but at least that'snot 500
<Rhiannyn> iiim baakkk
<Rhiannyn> bukkake
<Xanbreon> 90gig?!
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<Rhiannyn> ?
<Rhiannyn> lol
<Rhiannyn> olgjh
<drfsupercenter> 03tons of warez and crap
*drfsupercenter runs
<Syrune> Well duh
<Rhiannyn> olgjh
<Syrune> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I can't use shared hosting
<Rhiannyn> olgjh
<drfsupercenter> 03I've been banned from plenty of those
<drfsupercenter> 03for violating ToS
<drfsupercenter> 03dedis tend to not give a crap what you do as long as they get their money
<Xanbreon> Or till they get dmca'ed
<Xanbreon> Or equiv
<drfsupercenter> 03they're in Germany
<drfsupercenter> 03the DMCA doesn't really apply
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<Rhiannyn> ?
<Xanbreon> You would be surprised, thus gotta read the ToC
<Syrune> The DMCA is a retard anyway, but yeah, ToC's need to be checked on most server related hosting.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03with OVH I never got into truble.
<drfsupercenter> 03*trouble
<drfsupercenter> 03granted it wasn't *my* server
<drfsupercenter> 03I was renting part of it as a VPS
<drfsupercenter> 03but the guy I was renting from said he never got any DMCA complaints.
<drfsupercenter> 03actually I think he got ONE, when I was stupid and put up some MIcrosoft-related warez
<Xanbreon> How much bandwith are you using?
<drfsupercenter> 03MS seems t obe the only people actively checking
<drfsupercenter> 03not that much
<drfsupercenter> 03since apparently the dedi at OVH had 4TB/month and they never used even half of it
<drfsupercenter> 03and I wasn't the only person
<drfsupercenter> 03PHP Proxy Included <- xD
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd totally do that
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, so that site uses uTorrent?
<drfsupercenter> 03I believe that's white listed, depending on the version
<Xanbreon> mhhm
<drfsupercenter> 03I had to keep upgrading mine as they keep blacklisting older uTes
<drfsupercenter> 03-e
<Xanbreon> utorrent is one of the popular ones
<drfsupercenter> 03they want people using thje newer ones
<drfsupercenter> 03and I ahte the newer ones
<drfsupercenter> 03they completely f'ed up the GUI and stuff
<Xanbreon> It looks basically the same >__>
<Xanbreon> Anyway
<Xanbreon> I think seedbox+vps is more realistic
<Xanbreon> considering your tiny budget
<Syrune> uTorrent, Bittorrent and BitComet are the most used ones that I've noticed.
<drfsupercenter> 03LMAO BitComet
<drfsupercenter> 03that program is total malware
<Xanbreon> Bitcomet is a PoS
<drfsupercenter> 03the first one I ever used was called BitLord
<drfsupercenter> 03which is basically BitComet + even more malware
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Xanbreon> Banned most places cos its easy to fake ratio with it
<Xanbreon> Or it was
<Syrune> I use uTorrent or Bittorrent (Even though they are literally the same thing XD)
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03when uTorrent merged with BitTorrent is when it started sucking
<Xanbreon> ohreally?
<drfsupercenter> 03I liked uTorrent 1.8.5 or whatever
<Xanbreon> I didnt know they did that
<drfsupercenter> 03not the 2.x and 3.x
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep
<drfsupercenter> 03they did
<drfsupercenter> 03and they started making it look more noob friendly >_>
<Xanbreon> It looks basically the same >__>
<Syrune> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm anal about it
<Xanbreon> srsly, they changed a few icons
<Xanbreon> And added stuff like
<Xanbreon> UDP!
<Xanbreon> Which is far better than TCP for bittorrent
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/Sy63z.png
<drfsupercenter> 03I had to tweak the icon to get the "old" style
<drfsupercenter> 03I like the round one, not the square one
<drfsupercenter> 03</anal>
<drfsupercenter> 03but I think 1.8.5 is blacklisted on what.cd now
<drfsupercenter> 03or wait no
<Xanbreon> No comment re icons
<Xanbreon> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03it's allowed on what.cd
<drfsupercenter> 03but banned on hdbits
<drfsupercenter> 03since most of the music I got came from what.cd
<Xanbreon> They are generally going to be running the newest version of utorrent
<Xanbreon> So w.e
<Xanbreon> Anyway, finding a vps with 90gig of space
<Xanbreon> is not going to happen
<Xanbreon> So, you are going to need to trim some of the crap
<junh1024-XD> hard to find a decent torrent client that works on ALL privatetrackers ae?
<Xanbreon> Or rethink again
<drfsupercenter> 03or get a cheaper dedi with less spaced?
<drfsupercenter> 03-d
<drfsupercenter> 03because I still need a Share boty
<drfsupercenter> 03-y
<drfsupercenter> 03Share is a Japanese p2p that only works on Windows, no WINE or naything
<drfsupercenter> 03and requires completely unfirewalled Internet
<drfsupercenter> 03so I can't just do it here
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Xanbreon> Errhm
<Xanbreon> What a PoS
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03it's stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's the only way to get some rare anime stuff :/
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I was running Windows Server
<Syrune> Depends
<drfsupercenter> 03since I can use IIS to host and that way Share works
<Syrune> On what you mean by 'Rare'
<drfsupercenter> 03and I can use mIRC for scriptbot without needing WINE
<drfsupercenter> 03stuff like Pok√©mon de English
<drfsupercenter> 03they were Japanese DVDs made to teach kids English using Pok√©mon clips.
<drfsupercenter> 03funny stuff
<Syrune> Tried, bakaBT?
<drfsupercenter> 03nope
<nickstr> that I actually would like to see
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't speak Japanese but lik,e
<drfsupercenter> 03people on P-O just told me a lot of it is only on Share
<drfsupercenter> 03nickstr, I've got ISOs
<drfsupercenter> 03from Share
<nickstr> cool
<drfsupercenter> 03when I get a new server
<drfsupercenter> 03I can share
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice
<drfsupercenter> 03also I laughed
<drfsupercenter> 03because they spelled some words wrong
<drfsupercenter> 03explains why Asians can't spell for crap
<nickstr> and I have a 1 TB hard drive I am struggling to fill up
*drfsupercenter runs
<Syrune> Also, what.cd, invite only torrent site I'm guessing.
<nickstr> still have about 800 GB or so free
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<drfsupercenter> 03invite only
<drfsupercenter> 03and they don;'t even give away invitations
*Syrune not interested then :D
<drfsupercenter> 03you have to buy them.
<drfsupercenter> 03but I managed to get my own
<drfsupercenter> 03basically, they were super elusive and didn't let any new members in for a couple years
<drfsupercenter> 03my friend usotsuki SOMEHOW got an account made since hew as friends with one of the mods
<drfsupercenter> 03and all of us just used his account
<Syrune> Buy an invite!? Ok now I'm totally not interested in the site.
<drfsupercenter> 03then they added a feature, donate at least $1 and get two invites
<drfsupercenter> 03so I donated $1 as him, invited myself, bingo.
<HyperMetalLugia> The cost of piracy
<HyperMetalLugia> Trololololol
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03what.cd is amazing
<drfsupercenter> 03they're even bigger quality whores than I am
<drfsupercenter> 03and that site was actually notorious because someone broke into some record studio, physically stole some crap, and put it up on that site :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Wow
<Syrune> lol

<Syrune> Yep
<Syrune> Turisas is a band I know pretty well
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<drfsupercenter> 03haven't heard any of their other stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03but I have the whole CD
<Syrune> Saw em live so yeah xD
<drfsupercenter> 03I really want an instrumental of Battle Metal
<drfsupercenter> 03since I kinda hate this dude's screaming
<drfsupercenter> 03but the music itself is nice
<Syrune> Hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_AdgnAMKxU <- This is potentially one of the best things ever

*Syrune goes and checks his collection.
<drfsupercenter> 03as far as I know, they never released one
<drfsupercenter> 03I was checking on discogs and such
<Syrune> I wasn't planning on just looking at Turisas :P
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<Xanbreon> You know what
<Xanbreon> You read Hetzners ToS
<Xanbreon> Looks like they disallow P2P but that might be on there VPS's
<drfsupercenter> 03so Xanbreon, this is really weird. Ubuntu 9.04, if I live-boot it, has the Partition Editor... but if I *install it*, that disappears
<drfsupercenter> 03Not sure why.;
<drfsupercenter> 03but I actually need that
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Xanbreon> O-o
<Xanbreon> ubuntu
<Xanbreon> >broken
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I even disconnected the network thingy so it can't try to find repos that dont'exist anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03it's on the fricking CD, hence live boot
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm gonna try installing from the liveboot
<Xanbreon> You can add the cd as a repo
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> > put every package ever onto a couple of blu-ray disks
<HyperMetalLugia> No internet Linux yay?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but I mean
<Xanbreon> Fo sure
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's alreadyu there when you live boot it
<drfsupercenter> 03then why would it disappear during install
<drfsupercenter> 03it's ON THE CD
<Xanbreon> You can do a local repo mirror if you want as well
<drfsupercenter> 03well I'm trying install via liveboot
<drfsupercenter> 03in VMWare that is
<drfsupercenter> 03I need a Linux that has GParted installed in a VM so I can format flash drives and crap easily
<drfsupercenter> 03since I don't trust Windows for partitioning >_>
<Xanbreon> gparted O-o
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03what about it
<Xanbreon> best partition software
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03as much as "LOL Linux in VMs", I just boot up my Ubuntu VM, plug in drives, partition them, done
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's kind-of a problem if it that disappears x.x
<Xanbreon> :P
<Dagon> ud of
<HyperMetalLugia> uuuuuuuu
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03meh
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm still considering just getting one of those Hetzner dedisd
<drfsupercenter> 03-d
<drfsupercenter> 03the bidding ones
<drfsupercenter> 03but I did email them asking if it would be possible to customize a VPS with more hard drive space
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll see what they say :P
<Xanbreon> Emailed who?
<drfsupercenter> 03Hetzner.
<drfsupercenter> 03there's a contact form
<Xanbreon> Sure, you can get more HDD
<Xanbreon> but it will cost
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<drfsupercenter> 03but even their most expensive VPS is like ¬Ä19
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03so I was just asking if they could customize something
<drfsupercenter> 03I just want to see what they say
<drfsupercenter> 03oh for the love of god
<drfsupercenter> 03Xanbreon how would I use the Ubuntu CD as a repo
<Xanbreon> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#CD-ROM.2BAC8-DVD-1
<drfsupercenter> 03installing VMWare TOols first.
<drfsupercenter> 03I wonder if it borks because I name the computer "UbuntuVM"
<drfsupercenter> 03if I name it something like "danny-desktop", it worked o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03can you rename a computer once the OS is installed?
<Lava> o jesus do I even recognise anybody in here anymore
<Lava> uuuuhhh kinda
<drfsupercenter> 03I was asking Xanbreon
<Dagon> you recognise me
<Xanbreon> What
<drfsupercenter> 03also hi Lava, what was your username before?
<drfsupercenter> 03Can you rename the PC name in Linux
<Xanbreon> Yes
<drfsupercenter> 03once it's already installed
<drfsupercenter> 03how?
<Lava> Empoleon
<Xanbreon> Ermm, you change the err
<Xanbreon> hostname
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but what do I actually type
<drfsupercenter> 03hostname?
<Xanbreon> sudo nano /etc/hostname
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
<Xanbreon> You put it in there
<Xanbreon> Then you need to edit the hosts file
<Xanbreon> To make the hostname resolve to localhost
<drfsupercenter> 03ah I see
<Xanbreon> aka
<Xanbreon> sudo nano /etc/hosts
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, k
<drfsupercenter> 03lemme try another installation
<Xanbreon> And you should see an entry for your current hostname
<Xanbreon> Just mimic that
<Lava> uuh I guess nobody remembers, it's been a really long time. years or something.
<Dagon> it's ok
<Dagon> i have vague recollections
<Quanyails> 7Nyeh?
<Lava> I only remembered because Arti posted something on my DA page like an hour ago and went 'omg I totally forgot about that I'm a terrible person'
<drfsupercenter> 03hmm
<drfsupercenter> 03http://100tbh.com/Semi_Dedicated.html <- that cheapest one isn't too bad
<drfsupercenter> 03it's less than Heztner for similar hardware
<Quanyails> 7Did you have any alternate names, Lava, before?
<Lava> yes I was Empoleon before
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<Kyu> 07I sorta remember that |D
<Xanbreon> Dont buy VPS's from a seedbox host
<Lava> haha
<drfsupercenter> 03oh dear lord
<drfsupercenter> 03leaseweb
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah you're right
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm not using leaseweb :/
<Lava> this is what happens when I forget about something
<Xanbreon> seedbox hosts generally are ok for seeding
<Xanbreon> But for anything more latency sensitive or stuff
<Xanbreon> Yeh, dont touch
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah that ¬Ä6/month one actually seems pretty legit
<Quanyails> 7What, Lava? O.o
<Xanbreon> Might be <censored>
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm contemplating getting it just for lulz anyway xD
<Xanbreon> Worst that happens is you cancel and change hosts after a month
<drfsupercenter> 03what, for the seedbox?
<Lava> I leave for like two, three years then suddenly remember
<Xanbreon> Yeh
<Quanyails> 7Ah, well; if it's not so significant, why not?
<Lava> uuh well I'm going to go to bed, I guess I'll be bad tomorrow if I don't totally forget for two more years
<Quanyails> 7XD
<Quanyails> 7Weeeell, admittedly, there's not much to worry about.

<Light_Latias> 125?
<Light_Latias> 1210?
<drfsupercenter> 03minutes? Yes
<drfsupercenter> 03basically
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I got this $130 drive from Amazon
<drfsupercenter> 03plug it in, notice it's actually Seagate
<drfsupercenter> 03unplug it
<drfsupercenter> 03plug it back in
<drfsupercenter> 03it's dead.
<drfsupercenter> 03within like 2 minutes.
<drfsupercenter> 03which is a real shame as that drive is totally suited to me
<drfsupercenter> 03it's coated in rubber so it can withstand being dropped :D
<drfsupercenter> 03supposedly they even ran over one with a truck and it survived
<Light_Latias> 12lol wow
<drfsupercenter> 03but if the drive itself dies after less than 5 minutes...
<SilverSonic> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm basically holding a shiny piece of metal -_-
<Light_Latias> 12then Seagate hates you
<drfsupercenter> 03Yep.
<Light_Latias> 12:3
<drfsupercenter> 03so I sent the company an email
<drfsupercenter> 03asking if they can replace it with a non-Seagate

<drfsupercenter> 03look at the pictures
<drfsupercenter> 03that orange stuff is all rubber
<Xanbreon> But is it DRF proof?
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently not
<drfsupercenter> 03as it lasted less than 2 mins
<drfsupercenter> 03hence angry emails
<Xanbreon> Hahah
<drfsupercenter> 03http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/sc_b0058viwxi-fea01.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah see
<drfsupercenter> 03they show someone running it over with a car
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/R8CXr.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03I wonder if there's any point in waiting still
<drfsupercenter> 03or if I should just throw the stupid drive int he garbage
<drfsupercenter> 03oddly enough
<drfsupercenter> 03when I do a "full" check disk, the 5-pass one
<drfsupercenter> 03it does passes 1-4 fine and gets stuck on 5
<drfsupercenter> 03if I do the 3-pass one it stops right at the end of 3 and sits there for hours
<drfsupercenter> 03again, it's Seagate not wanting to co-operate x.x
<drfsupercenter> 03WOAH
<drfsupercenter> 03the drive came back to life
<drfsupercenter> 03that external one that died after 2 mins
<drfsupercenter> 03it magically repaired itself
<Rukario> updates
<Rukario> updates everywhere
<nickstr> more tinkering with Sound Solution and the transmitter resulted in a surprise
<drfsupercenter> 03so nickstr, I noticed something odd happening
<nickstr> I have duplicated the stereo channel separation and frequency response associated with FM on the AM band
<drfsupercenter> 03there's this radio station in Flint area, 105.5 FM
<drfsupercenter> 03thre's another station, 97.5 I think it is
<drfsupercenter> 03both are different stations
<drfsupercenter> 03but when I'm on the freeway, once I get a certain amount out of the city
<drfsupercenter> 0397.5 quite literally becomes an identical mirror station to 105.5
<drfsupercenter> 03just 20 seconds behind
<drfsupercenter> 03same commercials, songs, everything
<drfsupercenter> 03any idea why that would be happening?
<nickstr> might be a relayer
<nickstr> FM stations have to do that sometimes
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<nickstr> due to the line of sight characteristics of VHF
<drfsupercenter> 03even though in the city itself, it's a separate station?
<nickstr> or it might be a network
<nickstr> I heard of that happening too
<drfsupercenter> 03network?
<nickstr> two radio stations getting the same feed
<nickstr> https://rapidshare.com/files/416341042/The_Search_Is_Over_SRF-A100_AM_stereo.flac
<nickstr> this was one of the results of the tinkering with audio processing
<nickstr> it does happen on FM a bit
<nickstr> because like I said, limited coverage due to line of sight characteristics
<nickstr> back when I was in Washington this was ANNOYING
<nickstr> I hated listening to FM in some areas because the multipath and flutter was severe
<drfsupercenter> 03hm, that's interesting
<drfsupercenter> 03the registry hack to get the Zune hardware to show up as a flash drive in Windows
<drfsupercenter> 03still works under XP
<drfsupercenter> 03the newest version

<drfsupercenter> 03that's actually extremely useful for backing mine up and restoring it

*Skylands likes how so many of her friends have left YT after the new channel designs, including herself
<Xanbreon> Did you read the ToS?
<drf-Droid> >YT channels
<Skylands> 10Exactly
<drf-Droid> LOL READING TPS
<drf-Droid> *tos
<drf-Droid> and lik
<drf-Droid> e
<drf-Droid> they said I can install Windows server on there with my own key
<Xanbreon> Mhhhm
<drf-Droid> for a ‚Ç¨25 one time fee to do sth
<drf-Droid> since their reinstall console is TUI and only does linux
<Xanbreon> Aahh
<drf-Droid> >substitute teacher randomly mentions Raspberry Pi
<Skylands> 10Raspberry 3.14
<Angel_Espeon> 13Now I want raspberry pie, thanks a lot
<Angel_Espeon> 13:<
<drf-Droid> XD
<junh1024-XD> lol
<drf-Droid> anyway Xanbreon, not a bad deal for what I'm getting, eh?
<Xanbreon> Yup, not bad
<L[a]korv> you seriously didn't read the ToS?
<Xanbreon> But you need to read the ToS and network rules
<drf-Droid> granted that EX server is a lot better but I'm already paying over my budget as is
<drf-Droid> and meh, will do later
<L[a]korv> EDIS don't really have any ToS or rules that I could find :p
<Xanbreon> They have a list of accepted uses
<drf-Droid> generally dedis are like "do whatever you want, just don't get takedown notices"
<L[a]korv> which is practical, as it means I'm not technically breaking any agreement for running a tiny irc server.
<Xanbreon> IRC serv3ers, Rusia and Austria only
<Xanbreon> :P
<Xanbreon> *servers
<L[a]korv> where'd you find that? I've been looking several times.
<Xanbreon> http://en.edis.at/virtual-root-server_82.htm
<Xanbreon> Right at the top
<Xanbreon> Well, before the list of servers
<L[a]korv> right, that must be new.. I can't remember seeing that earlier o.O
<L[a]korv> because I had to ask about rDNS on Twitter a month or two ago.
<drf-Droid> LOL TWATTER
<L[a]korv> but that's annoying, apparently I'm not supposed to run my teensy server in Switzerland.
<Xanbreon> Oops
<Xanbreon> They probs wont notice unless you get attacked or something
<L[a]korv> yeah, my thoughts, too.
<drf-Droid> time for a challenge accepted?
*drf-Droid hides
<L[a]korv> and.. the text about VPN is confusing. At the very top, they suggest using VPN to Switzerland - and further down, you can't have 'open vpn relays' in Switzerland.
<L[a]korv> I guess that's just for 'open relays', and not openVPN.
<drf-Droid> you ever used Windows VPNs, Lakorv?
<L[a]korv> no?
<drf-Droid> k
<drf-Droid> nvm then
<Xanbreon> There wording sucks
<Xanbreon> Like someone asked them "er, do you have a list of acceptable uses?" and some random sysadmin typed something up at 2am
<L[a]korv> Probably not too far off from the truth.
<L[a]korv> they're helpful, though - gotta give them that.
<Xanbreon> I suppose it kinda depends on the R&R of the datacenters there boxes are in
<L[a]korv> r&r?
<drf-Droid> so is Hetzner :p
<Xanbreon> rules and regs
<L[a]korv> h.
<drf-Droid> I was practically IMing their support
<drf-Droid> via email
<drf-Droid> they replied in like 2 mins
<Xanbreon> Mhhm
<L[a]korv> drf-Droid: literally two-minute support response - via Twitter. Several times.
<L[a]korv> and outside of work hours.
<drf-Droid> I just need to temp upload this Windows Server ISO somewhere as they require *my* ISO to ensure the key works
<Xanbreon> Yeh, have fun with that :P
<drf-Droid> I was considering just using Debian but I am far too used to Windows
<drf-Droid> and why not
<drf-Droid> IIS actually works, as unpopular as it is.
<Xanbreon> Sure, it works, just not as well as others
<drf-Droid> that's my point
<drf-Droid> even on Linux, I've had terrible luck with Apache.
<Xanbreon> Apache is a pretty bad choice for a basic mostly static website
<drf-Droid> what do you suggest?
<drf-Droid> I tried lighttpd on Windows and it kept killing itself, not sure about unix
<Xanbreon> I use nginx, theres lighthttpd and some others which are even lighter but cant link to php/sql if neede
<Xanbreon> needed
<drf-Droid> hm
<drf-Droid> I've heard nginx was good
<Xanbreon> Its fast, pretty easy to setup and light on the ram and cpu
<drf-Droid> can you show me what its directory browsing looks like? :P
<Xanbreon> I dont have that turned on :P
<drf-Droid> I guess I can test it in a VM
<Xanbreon> Its got a module that should do it so
<Xanbreon> yeh
<drf-Droid> the only annoying thing about IIS is that I can't get .CGI stuff to work
<drf-Droid> CGI/Perl
<drf-Droid> I got PHP to work
<Xanbreon> php-fpm is a good one to use with nginx
<drf-Droid> is there a Windows build of nginx?
<Xanbreon> Looks like it
<drf-Droid> cool
<drf-Droid> I don't *have* to use IIS, but unlike apache, IIS didn't randomly crap out and die on me
<drf-Droid> and Apache, for some reason, would give people 56k speeds despite it being a 100mbps connection >_>
<drf-Droid> er *unlike lighttpd
<Xanbreon> Bad config
<drf-Droid> for which?
<Xanbreon> Whoever was geting bad speeds
<drf-Droid> oh
<Xanbreon> I have hit 100mpbs with nginx so meh
<drf-Droid> it was default Apache config
<drf-Droid> well
<drf-Droid> lighttpd and IIS went at the proper speed
<drf-Droid> apache had issues
<drf-Droid> but lighttpd would just stop working after a couple days
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.slashgear.com/fusion-io-releases-iofx-ssd-card-420gb-for-2495-12222607/
<drf-Droid> IIS let's you screw with MIME types, I had mine set so mp3s and such would open as binaries and bypass browser plugins :p
<HyperMetalLugia> but I leik my chrome browser plugin playing
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<drf-Droid> EW QUICKTIME PLUGIN
<drf-Droid> I set all the A/V filetypes as octet-binary :P
<Xanbreon> http://www.veyka.co.uk/radios/
<Xanbreon> There, thats the directory viewer by default
<HyperMetalLugia> No purty icons?
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF, my WIn7 doesn't have quicktime
<HyperMetalLugia> So :P
<HyperMetalLugia> It's the WMp plugin
<HyperMetalLugia> i think.
<Xanbreon> No, no pwiddy icons
<Xanbreon> Its an auto indexer
<Xanbreon> What do you expect
<Xanbreon> brb
<HyperMetalLugia> Can you add them:?:(
<drf-Droid> HML, either way, IE/Firefox open mp3s by default in a plugin
<drf-Droid> I set them as binaries so it prompts you to open/save instead :>

<drfsupercenter> 03one direction
<drfsupercenter> 03my mom pays for gas and I generally just do what I want LOL
<Skylands> 10I'll be paying for my own gas
<Skylands> 10and my own car insurance
<Skylands> 10if I can get employed
<Lighty> 06thats why i have a bycycle
<drfsupercenter> 03well it's not "my" car
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just our family's extra one
<drfsupercenter> 03that I get to drive
<drfsupercenter> 03xD
<Skylands> 10otherwise, mother will make me do extra work around the house
<drfsupercenter> 03so my parents pay the insurance for my sister and I
<drfsupercenter> 03and I have my mom's Mobil SpeedPass so as long as I use Mobil gas stations I can just have them bill her

<Skylands> 10I don't have my own car either
<Skylands> 10just share with dad
<Skylands> 10I should be able to drive myself to school next year

<Quanyails> 7Well, same with me; expecting more information.
<Quanyails> 7Currently, there's no connection to the previous game, other than the fact it's set in the future. O.o
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't care, at least until it's about a week away from being released :P
<drfsupercenter> 03or maybe out in Japan or something
<drfsupercenter> 03but there's no point in formultaing what may or may not be in it, just wait and see

<drf|class> "because the teacher said so"?
<Rukario> i lost respect for windows ever since that test tuesday
<drf|class> LOL what
<Rukario> completely ruined the fun of it
<Rukario> Your colleague at another company has installed DNS, but it is not mapping computer names to IP addresses. Which of the following might be the problem? (Choose all that apply.)
<drf|class> inb4 but Windows wasn't meant to be fun, it's SRS BSNS
<Rukario> a. DNS lookup zone records are not set up to update automatically, and your colleague has not manually created any records.
<L[a]korv> Rukario: f. Person screwed up.
<Rukario> b. There is no WINS-R zone.
<Rukario> c. The INIT records is missing.
<drf|class> inb4 "Blame Windows, end of story'
<Rukario> d. A single zone database can hold only 100 lookup records and there are over 100 records, so DNS has locked the zone.
<Rukario> drf XD
<Rukario> i'm just typing the question someplace so i can go back through the book and scan for it
<drf|class> so Rukario, I'm gonna be putting Windows Server 2008 on my dedicated server

<drf|class> Kyu are you being serio-OK
<Kyu> 07:3
<drf|class> well I'm supposed to explain what some specific syntaxes do
<drf|class> and I can't really tell just from trying them LOL
<Kyu> 07lol
<drf|class> and usually you can't like, reverse-lookup in the help
<drf|class> A(2,2:3:6) <- this, particularly
<drf|class> in a matrix called A
<drf|class> it returns two numbers
<drf|class> so wtf are the 3 and 6 doing
*Ray uses the pillow but still sleeps on Angel's head
<Kyu> 07absolutely no idea |D
<drf|class> same LOL
<Kyu> 07it was touched on in computer class 4 years ago for like 2 weeks
<Kyu> 07:'D
<drf|class> we used it in Engineering 101
<drf|class> which was like 2 years ago for me

<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Rukario> whee
<Rukario> this is annoying
<Rukario> i need to open my windows server 2008
<Rukario> but i can't
<Rukario> teacher told us not to
<Rukario> he has a record of the last time the VM was modified and if it's different from what he has, we are done
<drf|class> o.o
<drf|class> make a clone of it
<Rukario> that's what i'm doing right now
<drf|class> XD
<Rukario> i need to mess around with DHCP to get an answer
<Rukario> because once again this book is being cruddy and isn't being direct
<drf|class> ...
<drf|class> this person on Draw Something is a complete idiot
<drf|class> the word was Graduate
<RhiaLenne> yo
<drf|class> she puts "GRADUAET"
<drf|class> gets it wrong
<drf|class> starts moving letters around
<drf|class> then gives up
<drf|class> >_>
<RhiaLenne> Im in class..
<drf|class> as am I
<RhiaLenne> lol
<RhiaLenne> who are you talking to?
<drf|class> anyone?
<RhiaLenne> oh lol
<drf|class> ah I think I finally figure it out
<drf|class> yep
<drf|class> 4. A(2,2:3:6) returns the values in row 2, starting in column 2 and going through column 6. The 3 indicates that it should skip 3 values each time, in this case resulting in two values. In a later example such as A(2,2:3:10), it gives three values.
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Light_Latias> 12hai Danny
<drf|class> that took way too long to figure out.
<Aurora> well
<Aurora> this is a familiar site
<Aurora> 6sight
<drf|class> what is o.o
<Aurora> 6conversations I don't understand
<drf|class> ah
<drf|class> thought you were referring to me just talking aimlessly, and I was a bit ready to go cry in a corner
<drf|class> but k
<Aurora> 6um
<Aurora> 6why would you cry in a corner?
<drf|class> it's an expression.
<drf|class> it basically means I'm sad
<drf|class> :P
<Aurora> 6my point being
<Aurora> 6why are you sad
<drf|class> no, I mean, I would have been
<Aurora> 6I understand figures of speech
<Aurora> 6ok
<drf|class> if you were complaining about me talking about things you don't understand
<drf|class> but w/e
<drf|class> I've been a bit over-emotional lately, I blame lack of sleep
<Aurora> 6maybe stop staying up late? </shrugs>
<drf|class> I was just lying wide awake in bed last night
<Drake> 04always the realist
<drf|class> eventually I got back up and was like FFS, i can't sleep anyway
<drf|class> anyway

<drf|class> Carthatic?

<drf|class> I still have no idea what that means

<drf|class> you learn something new every day :P
<Drake> 04ayup
<drf|class> ...other than what I'm actually supposed to be learning, that is. XD
<drf|class> because FFS I hate math
<Drake> 04oh
<Drake> 04good
<Rukario> You are setting up a scope of addresses on a DHCP server between 138.90.10.2 through 138.90.10.99. However, you don‚Äôt want to have addresses 138.90.10.7 and 138.90.10.10 in the range of addresses to assign because these addresses are currently used for web servers. Which of the following is the best solution?
<Drake> 04another one who's the same
<Drake> 04I despise maths
<Rukario> i would redo the IP of the web servers
<Rukario> XD
<drf|class> wel;l
<drf|class> *well
<drf|class> I don't mind *simple* math
<drf|class> e.g. addition and subtraction
<drf|class> I can even tolerate algebra to a point
<drf|class> but when it gets into me answering what A(6:-2:2,10) does?
<drf|class> I have no idea
<drf|class> it has something to do with matrices
<drf|class> is all I nkow
<drf|class> *know
<Drake> 04GOOGLE AWAY
<drf|class> I've tried :/
<drf|class> ah I figured it out
<RhiaLenne> lol
<RhiaLenne> more people r on : lol
<RhiaLenne> i hate algebra
<RhiaLenne> im better at geo
<drf|class> wait til you get to calculus :P
<RhiaLenne> even hough im not even taking that clas
<drf|class> I used to complain about algebra too but calc is much harder.
<Rukario> Your assistant reports that users cannot access the DHCP server to lease addresses. What troubleshooting measures do you take? (Choose all that apply.)
<Rukario> Ensure that the DHCP Client and DHCP Server services are started.
<Rukario> Make sure the DHCP server is connected to the network
<Rukario> use device manager to restart the DHCP server
<Rukario> ensure DHCP is configured with the nic binding
<Rukario> well..
<Rukario> it's not C
<Rukario> XD

<Angel_Espeon> 13Has anyone ever captured a spellcard on their first ever attempt at it, but never again since then
<Angel_Espeon> 13I dunno why I just remembered this .w.
<Aurora> 6ugh
<Aurora> 6I'm sure I have
<Aurora> 6yeah
<Aurora> 6Keine's second card in extra, Reincarnation "Returning-Bridge Ichijo"
<Aurora> 6I somehow got that the first time around
<Aurora> 6it's a really easy spell but I keep messing it up lol.
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL that spellcard
<Angel_Espeon> 13It IS easy but I very rarely capture it ._.
<Aurora> 6yeah exactly
<Aurora> 6I'm not even sure why LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13One that came to my mind is this one http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=FaI0VRhKVQI#t=220s
<Kammerjunk> Is it just me, or is dari only in this room?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't recall ever capturing it after my very first attempt, tbh it's not all that difficult either considering it's Youmu xD
<Aurora> 6youmu gives me such trouble
<Aurora> 6no idea why
<Aurora> 6also
<Angel_Espeon> 13I think she gives everyone trouble LOL
<Aurora> 6which one, angel? you linked the whole stage
<String_Shredess> yeah... i wish he were actually here
<Gumri> He got a ban from #bronystate
<Gumri> I forget why
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Angel_Espeon> 13o.o weird, that link should take you straight to the spellcard I was referring to
<Angel_Espeon> 133:40
<String_Shredess> the OWNER of bronystate was BANNED?
<Gumri> Saturn owns it.
<Aurora> 6not on mibbit
<Kammerjunk> Well, owner and owner.
<Aurora> 6AHAHAHA I HATE THAT SPELL
<Kammerjunk> Ghosties is listed as Administrative Lead.
<Aurora> 6it looks so easy, but it is SO EASY to get distracted
<String_Shredess> me and Ghosties live in the same state
<Angel_Espeon> 13I know right D:
<Gumri> Hmm well I know Saturn has full control over the server and can do what he wants
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm also thinking I play PCB too much, I should be trying to 1cc UFO
<Gumri> I live in the same country as Saturn and prince-dari
<Angel_Espeon> 13I CAME CLOSE LAST TIME
<fluttercry> 05,15lucky
<Aurora> 6UFO ughggchj
<Gumri> (Great Britain)
<String_Shredess> i wish i lived in a great place. our countries only united
<Gumri> I should be meeting Saturn in two months time actually and then a month after that as well :)
<Angel_Espeon> 13Overall I did really well, until stage 5 came along and ruined everything
<Angel_Espeon> 13then I had like 1-2 lives to get through stage 6
<Aurora> 6sup, shou.
<Angel_Espeon> 13and somehow got about 5 seconds short of beating it ._.
<Angel_Espeon> 13CURVY LASERS ARE THE BANE OF MY EXISTENCE
<Angel_Espeon> 13I think I'm just gonna go ahead and attempt it right now in the false hope that I'll actually win this time
<Aurora> 6lol.

<Skylands> 10Saw the OVA

<Angel_Umbreon> 13I'll admit the base storyline is a tad melodramatic at times but I thought it was pretty interesting~
<Skylands> 10Is it finished?
<Angel_Umbreon> 13Yeah, finished fairly recently :P
<Angel_Umbreon> 13there's only 8 episodes

<Pattyrick> Hi SS
<Pattyrick> I'm in Espa√±a, thus the Espa√±ol :P
<drfsupercenter> 03Wow
<drfsupercenter> 03nothing like sleeping in until 6:15M
<drfsupercenter> 03*PM
<Skylands> 10Late
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03well considering yesterday I got less than 2 hours of sleep
<drfsupercenter> 03I kinda needed it
<Skylands> 10Test tomorrow morning :<
<drfsupercenter> 03also for some reason I can't seem to get a "good night's sleep" anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03like
<Skylands> 10I'm confident on English/Reading and somewhat Science
<drfsupercenter> 03I kept fricking waking up
<drfsupercenter> 03every 2-3 housr
<drfsupercenter> 03*hours
<Skylands> 10Math is another story
<drfsupercenter> 03honestly
<drfsupercenter> 03the math on the ACT is not that bad
<drfsupercenter> 03nothing harder than algebra
<Skylands> 10Well
<Kyu> 07keep yourself up 24 hours then go back to sleep at a normal time lol
<drfsupercenter> 03since it's designed for everybody and some schools do algebra in like junior year
<Skylands> 10Last year, Algebra II, had a bad teacher
<drfsupercenter> 03same her
<drfsupercenter> 03e
<drfsupercenter> 03but trust me
<drfsupercenter> 03there's nothing algebra II on there
<drfsupercenter> 03at least there wasn't when I took it
<Skylands> 10The only thing I understood and could do well was matrices
<Skylands> 10There is.
<Skylands> 10Sin, cosin, etc.
<Skylands> 10I don't know that stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03that's trig
<drfsupercenter> 03and well
<drfsupercenter> 03want a crash course?
*drfsupercenter runs
<Skylands> 10w/e, we brushed upon it in Algebra II
<drfsupercenter> 03for us that was ac ompletely different class o.o
<Skylands> 10I have this practice booklet for ACT
<drfsupercenter> 03algebra 2 was like the most retarded thing ever, I fail to see the point of such a class xd
<drfsupercenter> 03*D
<drfsupercenter> 03it was like LOL IMAGINARY NUMBERS
<Skylands> 10>can't do half the problems
<drfsupercenter> 03If they're imaginary, why the f*** are you talkiung about the
<drfsupercenter> 03m
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<Lexi> 12O.o
<Skylands> 10I took a practice one last year
<Skylands> 10Math was my lowest score
<drfsupercenter> 03math was my highest score o.o
<Pattyrick> Hogia :D
<drfsupercenter> 03also wtf
<Lexi> 12I suck at maths too
<Skylands> 10English/Reading was my highest
*drfsupercenter opens email, sees some creepy looking ad for Spirit Camera
*Lexi 12glomps Pattyrick
<drfsupercenter> 03English was my lowest LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03but that being said, I'm an engineer, it only makes sense
<Skylands> 10:P
<Skylands> 10I like math, just takes me more time to understand it
<junh1024-XD> oh?
<Pattyrick> *hands a piece of Domino's BBQ pizza to Hogia*
<junh1024-XD> aren't you doing compsci or IT now?
<drfsupercenter> 03I like math to a point

<Drake> 04ohai Quan
<Espeon> 06i understand math rather nicely but i despise it lol
<drfsupercenter> 03but they call it CSE
<drfsupercenter> 03computer science engineering
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<junh1024-XD> lolwut
<drfsupercenter> 03granted it's not "real" engineering
<junh1024-XD> i do CSE
<drfsupercenter> 03but I think like an engineer :P
<junh1024-XD> Computer Systems Engineering
<junh1024-XD> ORLY NAO
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate when everybod's like
<drfsupercenter> 03"You're an engineer? You must be good at math and science"
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm good at science but really? why math?
<Skylands> 10Stereotypes
<drfsupercenter> 03engineering is all about efficiency, isn't it?
<Skylands> 10They exist.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<L[a]korv> because engineers work a lot with math?
<Skylands> 10http://pw0nd.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/StereotypesCops-500x400.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03universities themselves stereotype then :P
<Drake> 04"Hey, you're a smart kid, why don't you like science?"
<drfsupercenter> 03akd L[a]korv, depends on what type
<drfsupercenter> 03engineering is a really broad area
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03funny thing is that I do like science
<junh1024-XD> inb4 Mythbusters
<drfsupercenter> 03I just hate when science and math merge (read: university physics)
<drfsupercenter> 03as that's entirely calculus
<drfsupercenter> 03and I despise calculus
<drfsupercenter> 03but Physics 1 in high school was my favorite class
<Pattyrick> Spanish stereotype: food is like Mexican; truth: Very different
<Skylands> 10imagine AP calc
<drfsupercenter> 03purely conceptual physics is awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03I *had* AP calc
<Skylands> 10oh?
<drfsupercenter> 03our school didn't have a non-AP calc
<Skylands> 10Sucks for you
<drfsupercenter> 03it was the same class
<Big_Jake_intosh> Happy friday guys :)
<drfsupercenter> 03oddly enough
<drfsupercenter> 03I actually got an A in it
<drfsupercenter> 03as I had a really good teacher
<drfsupercenter> 03who explained it
<Lexi> 12whoa
<drfsupercenter> 03in college, they just expect you to figure it out -_-
<Skylands> 10Professors won't assist you if you need help?
<drfsupercenter> 03depends on who
<Skylands> 10eh
<drfsupercenter> 03at U of M, the class wasn't even taught by professors
<Meanwhile> And to you.
<drfsupercenter> 03it was taught by these Asian grad students
<drfsupercenter> 03who didn't write the exams
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai Meanwhile
<drfsupercenter> 03I was so pissed
<Skylands> 10I think that's part of their job, either way
<Meanwhile> Allo.
<Skylands> 10They're supposed to teach you
<drfsupercenter> 03because they would quite literally teach things that weren't on the exam and vice versa
<Skylands> 10Not go, "You don't know this, no help for you"
<drfsupercenter> 03the exam was written by the math department, class was taught by grad students, >_>
<Lexi> 12ugh
<junh1024-XD> inb4 YOU SHALL NOT PASS (unless you go to tutorials)
<drfsupercenter> 03at this school I can get help yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03In fact I slightly LOL'd
<drfsupercenter> 03my programming teacher
<Skylands> 10tutors
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai there Big_Jake_intosh and Meanwhile
<drfsupercenter> 03was like "cheating is very serious, if you need help, please don't ask other people to avoid plagirism. Just email me your code and I'll help"
<drfsupercenter> 03I should totally challenge accepted sometime
<Lexi> 12lol
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL @ some spam emails
<drfsupercenter> 03"African Love Express"
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah no thanks
<Pattyrick> I love spam like that
<drfsupercenter> 03"Free Cams" <- would be good if it were true
*drfsupercenter runs
<Skylands> 10if you're desperate enough
<Pattyrick> So bad, almost good
*Skylands hides
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm smart enough to know not to click stuff like that :P
<Lexi> 12lololol wut
<drfsupercenter> 03desperate and smart aren't really related
*drfsupercenter hides
<Lexi> 12I'm tempted when there's stuff like "free bag of Skittles" and "free Coca-Cola sample"
<Lexi> 12but I know it's spam
<drfsupercenter> 03I generally avoid free offers unless they're on Woot
<drfsupercenter> 03as those tend to be legit
<drfsupercenter> 03granted 99% of them are American based so good luck with that :P
<Lexi> 12never heard of that
<drfsupercenter> 03it's a "one deal each day" site
<drfsupercenter> 03but there's a community page where people share offers
<Aurora> 6http://princess-bonnibel-bubblegum.tumblr.com/post/21043194913?og=1&fb_action_ids=431910466824849&fb_action_types=tumblr-feed%3Alike&fb_source=other_multiline&ref=nf
<drfsupercenter> 03and they only really make the main page if enough people validate that it's legit
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Aurora
<drfsupercenter> 03http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/3cbb26d0-4207-4cbc-859c-2aab880e9a1e.jpg
<Pattyrick> I never take any Internet offers seriously unless they're actually from an official website or if I've actually heard of it elsewhere
<drfsupercenter> 03so, this is just great
<drfsupercenter> 03my laptop's hard drive is broken
<drfsupercenter> 03not completely but it's got a couple bad sectors
<Pattyrick> Such as the 'free bag of Burger King fries with green ketchup for Saint Patrick's Day' offer, I know that's legit
<junh1024-XD> inb4 green eggs & ham

<RAWRity> Jaketehsnake: afraid the link won't work for me. You'll have to do it.
<Hans_Gruber> StinkomanFan can't, they're gay
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: they did, he's called Zeddie Little
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: It somehow turns out to be a Unicorn
<Everlasting_Joy> StinkomanFan It would be the sexiest thing in existance.

<StinkomanFan> Dermathil, turn off your poor excuse of a brain and just enjoy it
<UnFoundBug> nice one RAWRity

<junh1024-XD> I LOVE APPLE
<junh1024-XD> I DEFEND IT

<GabeMoist> Midnight is the best time to scream
<junh1024-XD> i buy a PC
*junh1024-XD hides
<drfsupercenter> 03and not "I'm going to buy an iPod because I'm cool"
<Hans_Gruber> :(
<Midnight_Fyre> Yikes, I just stood up and I felt like I was going to pass out
<Meanwhile> If I screamed at midnight I'd give myself away to whoever I'm following down a dark path.
<SunderlandPony89> Midnight_Fyre: I hate it when that happens >.<
<StinkomanFan> Dermathil, Name me one action movie that's plot wasn't to be awesome
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: Oh don't worry, trixie already knows you're there.
<StinkomanFan> ONE
<Dermathil> Inception's whole plot wasn't only to be awesome.
<Meanwhile> Props for thinking inside the chimney RAWRity.
<Midnight_Fyre> I had minor surgery this morning and I've been full of anestesia and painkillers all day
<Dken2021> so I'm guessing all the antagonist in die hard movies are germans?
<StinkomanFan> HA
<Meanwhile> Dermathil: It kinda was.
<Big_Jake_intosh> this movie is great
<Hans_Gruber> dat Friday the 13th lag
<Midnight_Fyre> makes me lightheaded
<SunderlandPony89> inb4 all civilians are killed
<StinkomanFan> It was partly awesome, and that's all that counts
<Jaketehsnake> Dken2021, Seems to be.
<Meanwhile> Indeed, via dreamscape they had an excuse to go to as many crazy places as they wanted.
<Dermathil> no it wasn't. It was also a metaphor about how a filmmaker can manipulate its audience through suspension of disbelief.
<Jaketehsnake> Bronystate Regulars is one of the only Partly civilized rooms during streams
<Drake> 04I wanted an iPod because of touch screenz
<Drake> 04But it's so damn buggy
<Meanwhile> And how many people went to watch it for that reason Dermathil.
<Tovler> another Friday 13th?
<RAWRity> so basically what Dermathil is complaining about is that Die Hard commits the unforgivable sin of being an action movie.
<SunderlandPony89> They could of just sent in one guy with a gun to find and kill Die Hard. That's all it would of taken. Jesus these guys are stupid...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Jaketehsnake we can change that ~
<GabeMoist> Bronystate regulars is civilaized
<Meanwhile> Who REALLY sat down and decided to see Inception because of the underlying messgae.
<Big_Jake_intosh> BEWBS
<Meanwhile> To the moooon
<Jaketehsnake> Oh Hai T. How long have you been here?
<Tovler> didn't we just have a Friday 13th like january or february?
<Midnight_Fyre> Usually, but when we go uncivilized we REALLY go uncivilized :P
<Hans_Gruber> Big_Jake_intosh WHERE?!
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT is always here. Lurking. Watching. Waiting...
<Dermathil> I went to see it because it had some intellect hidden inside, which is something this movie lacks entirely.
<StinkomanFan> Dermathil, I would have given you Blade Runner, I would have given you Minority Report, I would have given you HEAVY RAIN! But you went with the Cliche answer
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Jaketehsnake long before you ~ but i'm pro at lurking
<Drake> 04Everytime I sync it several of my albums have copies
<Big_Jake_intosh> Hans_Gruber: you missed em
<Drake> 04and then when I delete one it deletes BOTH albums
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL SYNCING
<Big_Jake_intosh> why was i kicked holy crap
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you see Meanwhile get's the idea
<drfsupercenter> 03on my Zune, I set it to "never sync anything, ever, for any reason"
<Dken2021> where are his shoes?
<drfsupercenter> 03and then I just manually add stuff
<Hans_Gruber> Big_Jake_intosh I missed bewbs :'(
<Dermathil> Stinkomanfan, thanks for mentionning Blade Runner. That movie is in my top 5 movies of all time. I just didn't think about it.
<otakon> kenne: dude, sorry about earlier
<Gumri> Bronies are ot a civilised people
<Meanwhile> Out of interest TheGreatAndPowerfulT, what're you waiting for?
<kenne> otakon: lolwut?
<Dermathil> also, WHERE DID HE GET THE GUN
<Jaketehsnake> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, I am too, but it isn't fun. Its like being pro at holding in a fart: Its doable, but there is no reason to want to do it
<Meanwhile> Allo otakon.
<Meanwhile> Dermathil: he's a cop, he had one on him.
<UnFoundBug> otakon arnt you supposed to be eating
<StinkomanFan> Dermathil he had it on him
<StinkomanFan> He's a cop
<otakon> kenne: for giving you grief on how you were playing, that's all. I'm sorry.
<RAWRity> Is Die Hard super intelligent existential film trying to say something without saying it, but that doesn't in any way make it bad. It's a simple, straightforward action film with good acting, clever writing, and superb acting. And that's all it's supposed to be.
<Big_Jake_intosh> uh oh lag EVERYPONY PANIC
<otakon> curse you lag!
<Midnight_Fyre> no reason you can't eat and chat at the same time
<RAWRity> *Die Hard isn't
<Drake> 04I cbf to do that
<kenne> otakon: dont you do that everytime though?
<Jaketehsnake> >Good Acting
<Meanwhile> Good acting AND superb acting RAWRity
<Jaketehsnake> ?Suerb acting
*Hans_Gruber is best pony
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile nothing in particular i just don't talk much unless the topic hold my interest
<Meanwhile> Redundant acting.
<Midnight_Fyre> Hint: He's the Japanese guy
<Jaketehsnake> Snapes says NEIN
<otakon> kenne: I don't usually get so aggravated about it though, I'm sorry for yelling at you.
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Your attention must not be easily held.
<StinkomanFan> Hans, by the end of this movie you won;t be
<Gumri> My headphones just unplugged and then it soumded as ifpeople are being raped
<Hans_Gruber> StinkomanFan silence you foal!
<Dermathil> Rawrity, those movies merely aren't the type of movie I like watching. Which is why I'm going to go see "Cabin in the Woods" in a few weeks.
<UnFoundBug> hello RX-78-3-SweetieBot
<Big_Jake_intosh> oh no wonder i am lagging steam decided to start downloading something now
<Meanwhile> Hey otakon, I picked up a Batarian sentinel, they do punch like battle tanks don't they.

<Jaketehsnake> Alan Rickman makes me squee with delight
<kenne> otakon: i cant tell hen you yell yell and when you koke yell anymore, it all sounds the same. either way its nothin
<otakon> Meanwhile: yes
<Meanwhile> I mean, I literally punched down a Geth Prime with full armour with him.
<Gumri> ohai otakon

*StinkomanFan hugs RX-78-3-SweetieBot

<SaxyPretender> 0,14eeenope, it's Snape
<StinkomanFan> Dermathil, nopony's FORCING you to watch this but yourself
<Dermathil> it sounds like an insanely good intellectual movie.
<Tovler> They say Cabin in the Woods is good, then again, they said the same thing about Drag Me To Hell, and that movie was horrible.
<Big_Jake_intosh> hooray lag is gone now
<Meanwhile> SaxyPretender: oh my god you're right. Damnit.
<Randomnerd> Okay, I'm here.
<Randomnerd> Hi all.
<Hans_Gruber> dat Friday 13th lag
<Meanwhile> Allo Randomnerd.
<Dermathil> Tovler, it was compared to inception
<SunderlandPony89> Tovler: Moviebob said Cabin in the Woods was a must see. Just saying
<Meanwhile> ^
<kenne> otakon: again man, itsn nothin dont think about it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai there Randomnerd
<Gumri> I have no lag atall Hans_Gruber
<otakon> Tovler: what is Cabin about man? I see computer screens and some scenes with what I think are B.O.W.s
<Randomnerd> I just gave up on watching the movie. I've seen it before, I'm here for the conversation.
<Hans_Gruber> Gumri silence you foal!
<Randomnerd> The lag became unbearable.
<StinkomanFan> People will keep mentioning Inception until something 'better' comes along
<Meanwhile> True.
<otakon> I've never seen Inception, I hear it's good.
<StinkomanFan> Note the quotes around better
<Dken2021> odd, I'm not experiencing lag, and I got a wonky wi-fi connection
<Randomnerd> otakon: I liked the costumes.
<Gumri> Inception is good
<Dermathil> otakon: a gang of 5 college students go have fun in a cabin in the woods and something is manipulating their environment through high tech surveillance systems.
<Tovler> otakon its some genre bending horror movie. that's all I know about it.
<otakon> ah
<otakon> Dermathil!
<Gumri> It is not a horror movie
<Dermathil> Call my name when Shaun of the Dead starts.
*otakon hugs Dermathil "How you been man?"
<otakon> Dermathil: sure
<Meanwhile> otakon: you've never seen Inception?
<Dermathil> I been okay
<Randomnerd> That one guy dressed in mad style.
<Meanwhile> What kind of hole do you live in.
<otakon> no Meanwhile I haven't
<Dermathil> He missed the week we streamed it
<RAWRity> From what I can tell, Cabin in the Woods is a horror comedy
<otakon> Meanwhile: Hurlock
<Jaketehsnake> My non-brony Ultra-sheltered and Naive friend is reading Fallout Equestria. He is having a really hard time accepting that The amin character is lesbian
<UnFoundBug> inception was boooring
<Dken2021> just when I said no lag, it just lagged
<StinkomanFan> mmmmmmmBreakfast sandwiches

*IshBestPony nomz otakon
<otakon> Jaketehsnake: wait.......he's struggling that she's a LESBIAN!?
<Meanwhile> I wish I could pretend to know what you just said Jaketehsnake.
<Midnight_Fyre> I honestly don't get the hype over Inception. It was OK, but nothing that special
*IshBestPony hasn't seen Die Hard
<StinkomanFan> The joke is Lesbianism
<StinkomanFan> :p
<Randomnerd> Joseph Gordon-Levitt, that's his name. God, he looks great in that movie.
<Hype> My name buzzed because you said that Midnight_Fyre

*Tovler reads any given comments section and loses faith in humanity.

<IshBestPony> *nomz
<SunderlandPony89> Poor bastard :(
<Randomnerd> We need some moon pies in here.
<Midnight_Fyre> I'll admit it has good visuals, but it takes a lot more than that to impress me in a movie
<Jaketehsnake> otakon, How do i explain it to him gently?
<RAWRity> I've heard "The Cabin In The Woods" described as "Evil Dead" meets "The Truman Show"
<Tovler> Inception was overhyped because it was "intelligent compared to all the other stupid popcorn flicks."
*SunderlandPony89 nomz IshBestPony hello!
<StinkomanFan> I loved The Evil Dead!
<Randomnerd> My local Convenience store has moon pies
<Midnight_Fyre> But then again I think Christopher Nolan in general is pretty overrated
*IshBestPony nomz SunderlandPony89
<Meanwhile> Jaketehsnake: Some people are attracted to people the same gender. *shrug*
<Randomnerd> Tovler: This.
<StinkomanFan> And Evil Dead 2 was even cooler!
<Randomnerd> Evil Dead is rad.
<Midnight_Fyre> Evil Dead II was awesome
<String_Shredess> about 20% cooler?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14EvilDead III was my first movie here
<Randomnerd> Every man wants to be Bruce Campbell.
<StinkomanFan> Even morso
<Jaketehsnake> Meanwhile, I accept that. I haven't told him yet, He is reall confused. How do I break it to him?
<Meanwhile> Jaketehsnake: say that.
<IshBestPony> mai first movie was Time Travelers Wife
<StinkomanFan> Say she's gay
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Jaketehsnake: give him a live demonstration
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: you hear they're making Evil Dead 4? and it's not by Sam Raimi?
<Gumri> That was awful
<StinkomanFan> That's it
<otakon> brb
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...Yeah, i did
<Meanwhile> Jaketehsnake: the more you play it down the easier it is to grasp.
<Midnight_Fyre> My first full movie was House (I saw the end of Twister)
<Tovler> My first movie was Mulan. Man, I'm old.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I wish I didn't

<Jaketehsnake> Whats that? Send him chapter 20.5 you say?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Indeed, you have Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Way to make me feel ancient by comparison.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I still remember blenders and Octavia's plot
<Gumri> I have a feeling that my first movie was the wickerman but im not sure about tat
<LunaTheBeloved> ^
<Meanwhile> Dat plot.
<Randomnerd> I think the first movie I ever saw was Ghostbusters. My brother watched it all the time, anyway.
<StinkomanFan> The first movie I EVER saw was this one right here.
<Tovler> The first movie I ever remember seeing is Bambi :'(
<LunaTheBeloved> First one I saw was Scott Pilgrim
<RAWRity> You guys wanna feel old? When somebody says "A decade ago" you still think of the 90s
<Randomnerd> BUt the first movie I've ever seen on here?
<Meanwhile> The first movie I saw here was Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
*drfsupercenter sighs
<Jaketehsnake> RAWRity, ....Damn...

*Skylands also sighs
<Midnight_Fyre> Octavia's plot? Do I want to know?

<Meanwhile> LunaTheBeloved: You didn't? I'm sure I posted everyone at least 5.
<Tovler> *suprised keanu face* 20 years ago, it was the 90s
<Gumri> Magically gone
<LunaTheBeloved> Nope, it was a terrible Christmas since I didn't get one
<Meanwhile> Is it bad that thinking of Octavia's plot makes me feel nostalgia?
<StinkomanFan> RAWRity.... akward :s
<SaxyPretender> 0,14awww hell, I'm feeling good
*SaxyPretender hugs everyone

<Midnight_Fyre> Octavia is also one of the Ohio bronies (like myself).
<Tovler> Garfield's 35ish
<Randomnerd> StinkomanFan: The comic strip started in '78
<Luna> 07,01Also.. what do you guys think of the vids being displayed before BMN?
<UnFoundBug> if theres one thing that always bugs me
<HyperMetalLugia> because my mp3 collection is larger than the disk
<HyperMetalLugia> and > Rockbox
<HyperMetalLugia> So

<Gumri> I would preferif they were pony...
<IshBestPony> Columbus
<drfsupercenter> 03also wtf? syncing sansas? They're supposed to show up as a hard drive, how would you even sync it o.o
*Skylands runs
<Jaketehsnake> UnFoundBug, Never, It ruins chances for explosions, which they love
<HyperMetalLugia> exactly
<HyperMetalLugia> but
<Dken2021> the mformative videos? don't mind
<Bjornfot> Luna: No idea, what were they?
<HyperMetalLugia> if there was software
<Tovler> The only thing I remember about the 00s is Chappelle's show and The Boondocks.
<Midnight_Fyre> Ah, I'm up east of Cleveland
<HyperMetalLugia> from Sandisk
<Dken2021> *informative
<UnFoundBug> but bullets can't cause explosions
<otakon> LordCelestia: stuff on the further assault on liberty and freedom on the internet
<StinkomanFan> Good thing nopony was stupid enough to make Die Hard into a video game :s
<UnFoundBug> and explosions dont involve that much fire
<SunderlandPony89> UnFoundBug: So then it's an unfound bug for hollywood?
<LunaTheBeloved> Ah Chappelle's show.....good times...
<Midnight_Fyre> I used to live in Columbus though and I hope to miove back eventually
<LordCelestia> 0,5Speaking of bullets, there was a gunfight in my city today
<Meanwhile> Where's the fun in not making explosions.
<drfsupercenter> 03OK WTF
<RAWRity> UnFoundBug: it's used in order to allow the audience to see the action more clearly. There's just certain liberties you take when making a film in order to make it easier to follow.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm running memtest on my dedicated server
<Jaketehsnake> My grandparents are living in cleavland right now.

<Krakass> The Die Hard Arcade game was fun
<SaxyPretender> 0,14RAWRity, i think they hit the point of self-parody
<Krakass> So was the one for either the PS1 or 2
<StinkomanFan> Yes Tovler
<otakon> SaxyPretender: well, 5 movies are like that
<Midnight_Fyre> I wish they would come up with new ideas and leave the old classics alone
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<StinkomanFan> The singing robot fish
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: I'm hoping the 6th will be "Old Habits Die Hard"
<SunderlandPony89> UnFoundBug: Exactly! Mythbusters has proved that so many times!

<Meanwhile> Because that's how they roll
<Tovler> gasoline
<Bjornfot> short for gasoline
<UnFoundBug> Gumri its shorthand for Gasoline
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> gasoline just short
*RAWRity tattoos the words "Trixie is my Waifu" on Meanwhile's upper arm.

<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Dken2021> there wll be so many people in the main room screaming

<StinkomanFan> RAWRity, it wouldn't work. It's not an A movie, it's a B with its Critical reviews
<StinkomanFan> :p
<Everlasting_Joy> If Never got picked for a movie, BroState would have a very small populace for a time.
<Gumri> My moostashe!
<Dken2021> isnt that movie a high budjet?

<String_Shredder> thats alot of wasted money
<RAWRity> SunderlandPony89: still qualifies for A movie.
<Tovler> Halloween 2007 is A, therefore Bieber is A movie.
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: If I win Never Say Never for A and you win it for B we might just have one of the most brilliant moments of trolling in the history of BronyState
<Dken2021> where are these people's shoes?
<ScootaChicken> Nay, the internet
<Yahooz> Bieber is A because... its Bieber :p
<SilverSonic> someone should get rid of that vhost.
<Midnight_Fyre> No lag, not now

<Midnight_Fyre> Let me rephrase that then. Can't get full automatic weapon without a special permit
<Hype> Everlasting_Joy: There was a massacre in a primary (Re: elementary) school in 1996 in Dunblane Scotland using handguns

<drfsupercenter> 03brb
<Everlasting_Joy> fluttercry and Hype Ah, I see.
<otakon> Shaun KING OF THE ZOMBIES!
<ScootaChicken> Hype: a primary school?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> In the US you need a liscence for ownership and operation of a class 3 destructive device to get fully automatic weaponry, and various types of explosives
<ScootaChicken> Damn.
<[SHAUN]thehated5689> damn straight
<Hype> Yeah, a primary school
<Gumri> oh look
<ScootaChicken> Hype: who was the shooter?
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> Also, some lasers are classified as class 3 destructive devices
<ScootaChicken> Hopefully not one of the students
<otakon> damn RX-78-3-SweetieBot should have know you knew that, considering your a gunsmith and all.
<Gumri> It's the general public
<fluttercry> 05,15An older Scout leader
<Hype> Thomas Hamilton, they don't know what his motives were
<otakon> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: HOW? They haven't made a weaponized laser yet have they?
<fluttercry> 05,15all the victims were 5-6 year olds, and one teacher
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> I liek guns :3
<Hype> But he killed a lot of kids and a teacher
<UnFoundBug> that poor teacher
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> otakon: not one that works effciently for cost and size
<otakon> RX-78-3-SweetieBot: oh
<Hype> The shooter killed himself
<[SHAUN]thehated5689> worse than a cell going of in a movie theatre
<RX-78-3-SweetieBot> but there are plenty of killer lasers. they just giant and use a LOT of power
