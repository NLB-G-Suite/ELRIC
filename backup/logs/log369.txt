<Dumori> GOD Damn it
<Dumori> now a shit ton of stuff is broken
<KwakLad> Dumori, least you aint for 8 drives renaming themselves, but i feel your pain for the breaking
<Fazana> I'm back
<Fazana> set some noodles cooking ^_^
<Fazana> I remember stuff happening like that
<Fazana> I used to have a FAT drive
<Fazana> but it changed to a bloody NTFS
<Saturn> 08,01TheDerpyShotz: i is in lab and has no sounds
<TheDerpyShotz> ?
<TheDerpyShotz> a lab?
<paradise92> which is better Ren & Stimpy or SOuth Park?
<Saturn> 08,01Ren & Stimpy
<paradise92> all the way
<Fazana> Ren and Stimpy, easily
<Dumori> Kawack loads of my disc dr=ves and such are renamed too but they didn;t brake stuff
<Dumori> luckly
<Fazana> I had to resort my programs because my HD type changed for some reason
<Fazana> I have NO idea why
<Dumori> also I've grown 8 V drives
<KwakLad> Ren and Stimpy
*Fazana hugs 8TB EHD
<Dumori> ugh some one must have installed more V drives while I was away fro " fucking days
<Dumori> YAY
<Saturn> 08,01Fazana: RAID?
<Fazana> Brb, noodles might be done
<Saturn> 08,01if so, which level?
<Fazana> TB = terribyte
<Fazana> EHD = external hard drive
<Vivix> terra
<Fazana> Yeah, wasn't sure how to spell
<KwakLad> Thank you Vivix
<Fazana> anyway, brb
<Vivix> I had 2tb, but broke hte storage drive-
<Fazana> and I didn't understand Saturns message
<Vivix> I think he was wondering if you had it in RAID
<Saturn> 08,01Dumori: lolwindows
<Dumori> I know Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01what are these... drive letters?
<Dumori> the dumb bastard of an OS
<Saturn> 08,01trolololo
*Vivix hugs windows
<Dumori> there we go "fixed"
<Lasharus> ...I think I just got myself the perfect job.
<Lasharus> You'll excuse me while I go cheer now.
<Lasharus> WHOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<Vivix> Grats'!
<Lasharus> Cheers.
<Saturn> 08,01yeah, try something like this in windows: mount -t iso9660 -o loop whatever.iso /mnt/cdrom
<KwakLad> Whoo go Lasharus ,but what is the job?
<Lasharus> Translator.
*Saturn 08,01hugs Lasharus
<Saturn> 08,01woohoo! you rock!
<Vivix> Windows isnt too good at anything--serious I figure, but It's the best at music I've used
<Lasharus> Pays well, you can decide your own hours, no forced amount of assignments you have to handle.
*Lasharus hugs Saturn.
<Dumori> Yeah I fixed it
<TheDerpyShotz> Holy Mongoose on a cola mountain
<Lasharus> As a language student, that seems to be fairly acceptable for me :P
<Dumori> I also told said V drive program to NOT use that drive letter
<Vivix> Sounds like a good job to me
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: hey now, it's great for somethings. windows is nature's way of telling you that you have more money than sense.
<Lasharus> Indeed. So I'm happy.
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Lasharus> I'm reading EVERYTHING on their site first though.
<Lasharus> Because my main thought just now is "so... what's the catch?"
<Dumori> meh I got this Rig for less than the cost of it's GPU and CPU new
<Vivix> I used linux when I was younger, but I just defaulted to windows a while back
<Saturn> 08,01though, y'know, it's fine as a desktop OS
<Vivix> Ah
<Dumori> OS and ram and MB and drives where free
<Dumori> only prebuit I've every brought and most cos it was such a steal
<Vivix> Nice
<Saturn> 08,01Fazanaaaaaa
<Saturn> 08,01come baaaaack
<Saturn> 08,01i want to nerd out about harddrives with yooooou
<Vivix> hehe
<Dumori> x3
<Dumori> I wuse windows out of lazy
<Vivix> I accidentally bought 5400 rpm when I replaced my hdd
<Saturn> 08,01i use linux out of lazy, to be honest
<Dumori> I cba to spend an hour every game install
<Vivix> Somehow, I dont think its all that slow
<Dumori> to get them to work
<Vivix> I would use linux if I knew good music software, just to streamline you know
<Dumori> Plus Steam on lniux is wacky at times
<Vivix> but, as of yet I use windows for games and music-
<Vivix> though music computers shouldnt have internet access
<Dumori> I used to run OSX Windows and Linux all on the same rig
<Dumori> I was too lazy this time to bother
<Vivix> hehe
<Jim> ohai again
<Dumori> Also hackentoshes are harder and hardr to pull off
<Vivix> We used macs in school in studio and recording, but they would always crash the software or break down
<Dumori> hehehe
<Vivix> Even in the studio in the city we borrowed a mac, and it fried two audio cards
<tematric> when was that?
<Dumori> I mosty used mack for working with iOS
<Vivix> 2010-2011
<Dumori> as you need it to compile and sign
<Vivix> I think macs are great if you know how to use them, but a bunch of IBM lovers probably find ways to accidentally crash it
<Saturn> 08,01to be honest, i get most my music through spotify, or on CD
<Saturn> 08,01and i don't play games
<Vivix> Oh yeah listening to music its cd and spotify
<Saturn> 08,01though i do have all 3 major OSes installed, just in case
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> I played games alot, but I kinda feel the gamer in me is getting bored with games
<Saturn> 08,01(the third is BeOS)
<Saturn> 08,01(just kidding, it's MacOS)
<Vivix> Lately I've found way more entertainment through books than in games
<Vivix> Hey, did you try OS/2 way back in the days? My father had it and I always thoughti t looked cool, but dont know anything about it
<Saturn> 08,01(now you need to decide which of those two statements is more horrifying)
<Saturn> 08,01i did!
<Saturn> 08,01i thought it was pretty cool, actually
<Vivix> Didnt it have like voice commands, sort of?
<Vivix> All sorts of new strange things-
<Saturn> 08,01i honestly can't remember
<Vivix> I dont remember much about it other than "Looks cool!"
<Saturn> 08,01it was trying to be System 7 done properly, i think
<Vivix> Ahh
<Vivix> I miss being a nerd-
<Vivix> after music and gaming I fell so far out of the linux and hardware things, I dont know much about current systems
<Fazana> I'm back
<Jim> Welcome back Fazana
<Vivix> I still build my own computer when Its time to upgrade but thats not really hard
<Vivix> Welcoma
<Fazana> Mmm... that was nice, yumyum
<Fazana> Since I started racing cars, my knowledge of computers has literally dropped
<Fazana> I derped at something really easy
<Vivix> What kinda races you do?
<Saturn> 08,01Fazana!
<Fazana> One sec
<Saturn> 08,01noooooo!
<Vivix> Hehehe

<Fazana> I race replicas of these
<Vivix> Ahh
<Fazana> Since the real things are really expensive, we made replicas
<Vivix> Yeah
<Fazana> Plus all the safety stuff
<Vivix> My dad does drag races with American vintage cars
<Fazana> My nosecone is tonnes different though
<Vivix> I don't nkow much about cars but, it can be fun to watch
<Fazana> Mine's like a modern f1 car
<Vivix> Ah, coo
<Fazana> Mines a bitch to turn, but it's speed and accelleration is good
<Fazana> so I can outpace most cars on straights
<Vivix> Yeah, it's alot- behind racing that I dont understand, you know techniques
<Fazana> Racing looks easu
<Fazana> But in real, it's really really really difficult
<Vivix> yeah
<Fazana> I got a new gearbox recently, and I still have to pay for it
<Vivix> Its a pricy hobby
<Fazana> Because my old one collasped in a fast corner
<Fazana> I'm still trying to get used to it :c
<Saturn> 08,01Fazana: is your external HD RAIDed?
<Vivix> dad needed a new gearbox for his, (Valiant 67) and he had to eh put it together himself cause it was so expensive
<Fazana> I'm not sure
<Fazana> Lemme check
*Vivix wants raid- terrified of loosing stuff
<Fazana> Nope
<Saturn> 08,01Fazana: LVM?
<Fazana> Naerp
<Saturn> 08,01do you have 4 drives lumped together as one?
<Vivix> Just storage?
<Saturn> 08,01or 4 seperate drives?
<Fazana> No, 1 big
<Saturn> 08,01and it's 8TB?
<Fazana> Yeah
<LordCelestia> 0,5Hello
<Vivix> Helloo
<LordCelestia> 0,5'Sup?

<Saturn> 08,01it must, it MUST!
<LordCelestia> 0,5hah
<Vivix> My favourite nerd topic; Transistor vs tube
<KwakLad> Hullo LordCelestia
<Vivix> well, it was a few months back
<Saturn> 08,01oh, it's probably called a Dynamic Disk in windows
<paradise92> :P
<Fazana> Yeah
<paradise92> only mods are allowed to have colorfull writing?
<Fazana> If I got to have coloured writing, I would have it orang
<Vivix> I'd have pink
<Vivix> just--cause pink is kindof azm
<Fazana> and pink|!
<Saturn> 08,01i'd have yellow!
<Cypresswolf> Good morning, Everypony
<Fazana> You DO have yellow
<Vivix> Mornin

<Dken2021> he likes bananas but hates pears? the doctor sure is picky
<Cypresswolf> *pear lands at LordCelestias hooves and rolls to a stop*.....
<Cypresswolf> ...Darnit! How does Discord do it? :|
<Fazana> I think my favourite doctor was probablly Chris Eccles
<Cypresswolf> anyways, :) I have incredible luck this morning. I got a Chief Thunderhooves custom from a link on Equestria Daily.

<Kammerjunk> "It's ring-shaped, it's gift-wrapped, it's basically useless, and it's really expensive," say Valve. "In short, it's the most accurate simulation of an actual Valentine's Day gift ever made available to the public."
<Kammerjunk> Sounds like VALVe to me.
<Fazana> Deffo

<Cypresswolf> I think I hit the whiskey a bit too hard last night...*locks bottle away*
<LunarKing> why?
<Fazana> I want a RD bedding
<Fazana> But since I'm in a double bed because I like to stretch out, I doubt there's one for double bedding

<OneTrickPony> oh
<Morty> brotherhood=10x the other shitty anime
<OneTrickPony> I like full metal alchemist
<Dken2021> oh we're watching full metal alchemist?
<Morty> brotherhood, aka the good one
<paradise92> better sub than dub everytime...except for dragon ball...hate gokus voice
<Dken2021> roomate I had used to watch this, he didn't seem the type to like anime, but he seems to like this
<OneTrickPony> lol
<Morty> and the real one, considering the first one only followed the fantastic plot set up by the author for the first few episodes
<LunarKing> FAIL
<Fazana> Lol
<Fazana> Mayor = mass murderer
<Fazana> GRASG
<Fazana> Why does the stream always stop on good bits
<paradise92> mine doesn't
<Morty> no you fools!
<LunarKing> hello
<Sumica> 00,10boom headshot
<LunarKing> now what?
<otakon> it's not very effective
<PrototypeX9000> this...is actually kinda cool
<otakon> damn, they revealed the blood rune early in this one
<otakon> PrototypeX9000: it gets better
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Sumica> 00,10this ep had to hook people
<Sumica> 00,10action and back story all in one ep.
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> good intro ep
<Sumica> 00,10limit the pading of eps
<Morty> also, this episode had to be filler. To show that it is a different series from the crappy original
<otakon> indeed
<MasterBrony> @ Fazana i got the 0.8v and it still wont work
<otakon> the whole series is only 64 eps
<Fazana> Have you deleted meta-inf?
<Morty> the first anime series followed the manga for a while, so they had to start this one differently
<LunarKing> that guy just pissed off ed
<Fazana> Do you have modlpader?
<otakon> which is fairly short
<otakon> oh you idiot!
<MasterBrony> i have MCPatcher
<Sumica> 00,10blood is also water.
<tgl1992> IMO, I loved Brotherhood anime better than the original anime
<otakon> using his own blood to do alchemy
<Fazana> MCpatcher isn't used
<MasterBrony> i can figure out moduploader
<otakon> tgl1992: me too
<MasterBrony> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/294/
<Fazana> You have to manually do it
<otakon> gotta love Mustang

<LunarKing> brotherhood
<paradise92> Brotherhood
<otakon> this IS the ORIGINAL
<MirrorImage> in anime terms, i mean
<Morty> this is the infinitely better one
<MirrorImage> not-brotherhood was the original anime
<otakon> the anime was more OVA than anythign
<paradise92> well the first one was awesome
<Fazana> :(
<LunarKing> what does OVA stand for anyway
<Morty> the plot for the first anime made no sense at all
<Fazana> Stop. Stopping. The. Stream. You. damn. internet
<otakon> MirrorImage: true, but it wasn't really true to the manga. I honestly find this series better
<OneTrickPony> be back later bye everypony
<otakon> LunarKing: Original Video Animation really
<paradise92> winry is a sexy bomb :D
<LunarKing> thx
<otakon> think of it as a "What if"
<Morty> wtf was that bs with rose at the end of the first anime?
<otakon> paradise92: not yet in this scene, but god her outfits
<LunarKing> what if, winry didn't exist
<otakon> noes!
<Morty> the whole thing made 0 sense
<LunarKing> well ed would be fukd
<LunarKing> NO!!!
<otakon> if Winry never existed yeah Ed would be fucked
<Morty> the end to this series is the best end of any anime ive seen
<otakon> and THIS is why Ed is short
<paradise92> yeah
<Fazana> I never drink milk.
<paradise92> but the end to the first one was sad :(
<Fazana> Um.,.. I'm short 3:
<otakon> also, Pinoko! MAN! she was something back in her heyday
<MirrorImage> otakon - i'm so tempted to run with that statement literally...
<Fazana> It must be true
<Sumica> 00,10the faces in this amuse me.

<Fazana> I'm a black Pegasus, with broawn mane and tail, with red eyes, that's what my Pony looks like
<otakon> Sumica: don't forget the fish eye lense on the camera
<LunarKing> 30% of our DNA is the same as a lettuces lol
<Morty> but if they never tried this? flasky would have owned the universe
<Fazana> Lawol
<Sundaysmile> they never added milk!
<otakon> LunarKing: we're 98% similar to Chimps in DNA structure
<paradise92> i screamed to them DON'T DO IT!!
<MirrorImage> Sumica - there'll be more than just a red moon shortly. the floor will be just as red
<LunarKing> :D

<Sumica> 00,10yep Ed has defenatly suffered a BOSD

<otakon> that's the one real perk you have from being thrust into the Gate Of Truth
<paradise92> yeah
<paradise92> you get to do alchemy without
<paradise92> a circle
<Morty> otakon: not true. If you look carefully, you can see the answers to all questions, including ponies
<otakon> circles, equipment or tatoos
<Sumica> 00,10so many honorifics
<Fazana> I could sense a "seems legit" from Ed
<otakon> Morty: true, but the COST MAN! the COST!
<Morty> its worth it to know the ages of the man
<Morty> e 6
<otakon> yh, but that knowledge would probably cost you everything
<otakon> ofc Ed doesn't realize he saw it coming
<otakon> see
<paradise92> lol
<paradise92> owned
<Lawnchair> Best President.
<otakon> yh, King is scary
<Sundaysmile> Dear Reader!
<Fazana> Better than Obama
<otakon> hmmm might be
<Morty> King is best swordsmen
<otakon> oh definitely
<otakon> seriously though
<Morty> King is best fighter?
<otakon> why Fuhrer AND President in his title?
<Morty> besides flasky
<paradise92> no
<otakon> isn't it a little redundant
<otakon> damn
<Iota> !upsidedown

<Otaku> o_O
<Otaku> O_o
<Otaku> O_O

<otakon> ALEX LOUIS ARMSTRONG!
<Morty> -_- not even close
<Fazana> Morty: Chuck Norris?
<otakon> Morty: I think Izumi could probably take him
<Morty> hmmm thats the one person who has a chance
<otakon> I like the crayon outro
<Morty> but i think he'd still win
<otakon> serioulsy though, that intro gives out WAY too much info
<Fazana> Not for me
<otakon> it almost ruins the damn show
<Fazana> I already knew what Equiv Extange was
<Morty> what intro?
<otakon> well I'm not talking about that
<Morty> this one?
<Morty> or the rain one?
<otakon> Morty: no, the little intro before the opening we JUST SAW
<otakon> the one with the Narrator
<Morty> oh

*Morty nods
<Fazana> A hermophrodite?
<otakon> no
<otakon> just no gender
<Morty> he's like magneton
<Sumica> 00,10a unic
<otakon> since he can shape change and all
<Morty> or legendaries that arent lati@s
<Fazana> Magneton? You mean like the pokkyman?
<otakon> but he prefers a young male body
<otakon> apparently
<Morty> otakon its not necessarily male
<Midnight_Tempest> o.o FMA... AWESOME!

<Starflash> Hmm ok~
<Wrek> 05i should study
<RAWRity> You know, as much as I like Brotherhood, after rewatching the finale, I have to say that the ending is absolutely exhausting. It's like, 10 episodes long!
<Wrek> 05but fallign asleep to FMA sound goooooood

<MasterBrony> im going to marry Princess Luna one day

<otakon> lol
<Sumica> 00,10and much like jello you have to.......er spoilers
<Midnight_Tempest> to get a philosophers stone is an evil thing... evil thing...
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: eeyup it is coming
<Randomnerd> Oh, that's why he saluted with the wrong hand... he is missing the right one.
<RAWRity> Randomnerd: well...duh
<Midnight_Tempest> oh i know otakon, i watched the original anime and the movie... loved that movie ^_^
<Morty> ohai rawrity
<Randomnerd> Someone pointed it out before that he saluted wrong on the train :-/
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: ...that fucking movie.
<Wrek> 05hey RAWRity, did you see trenchcoat rarity?
<derpy_pony> hello
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: Ihave the movie, gbut I haven't watched it yet
<Midnight_Tempest> RAWRity: didnt like it eh?
<otakon> hi derpy_pony
<RAWRity> Wrek: already favorited on it and commented!
<Kencolt> He could use the right hand-- but he'd be knocking himself out all the time if he did that.
<Morty> Wrek did you color tcoat Rarity?
<otakon> OH CRAP MY LAUNDRY!
<otakon> brb guys
<RAWRity> Morty: eeyup, it's up on his DA
<Morty> coolness
<Sundaysmile> Are they playing harry potter music?
<Midnight_Tempest> yup, and that train goes to hogwarts :D
<RAWRity> also, you know what's up on MY DA page?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Hey prince-dari
<RAWRity> this: http://lossthief.deviantart.com/#/d4ppbus
<RAWRity> now, READ IT. and GIVE ME YOUR OPINIONS.
<Midnight_Tempest> but im watching anime... cant read... too long
<Fazana> A decent one too
<MasterBrony> i dont read fanfics
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: then set it aside to read later
<MasterBrony> cupcakes.....'nuff said
<KwakLad> the continuity announcer sounds sooo pleased with himself
<RAWRity> MasterBrony: this has literally nothing to do with cupcakes.
<MasterBrony> after that fanfic
<MasterBrony> i dont read any fanfics EVER
<RAWRity> That's like saying you wont watch movie anymore after watching Hostel.
<Midnight_Tempest> MasterBrony: remember... we dont talk about THAT fanfic here...
<MasterBrony> agreed
<Sundaysmile> What genre of fiction does this fall under RAWRity?
<Morty> with what nerves is al twitching?
<RAWRity> Sundaysmile: Well, as of now it's just Normal or General fiction, later on the story gets a tad grimdark, but nothing gory or nasty.
*Midnight_Tempest rolls around in some wool. Me Gusta
*MasterBrony begins contructing machine to breach 4th wall
<Morty> she's a keeper
<Sumica> 00,10spliting wood with his fist
<Fazana> SPARKLES
<Sundaysmile> And looking good while he does it
<RAWRity> Ah Winry, you become so meaningless during the finale.
<Morty> why are empty coat sleeves so bad ass?
<Midnight_Tempest> i just suddenly thought of Armstrong as Dragonborn... why?
<Sumica> 00,10cause that would be awsome
<Morty> Rawrity: are you sure you arnt thinking of the first anime?
<Midnight_Tempest> the idea of Armstrong punching dragons to death is... epic
<Sundaysmile> it's dazzling
<RAWRity> Morty: I'm thinking of Brotherhood, most definitely. During the 10 episode finale, she really doesn't have anything to do.
<Fazana> Armstrong Vs. God.
<MasterBrony> armstrong would win
<Morty> yeah I suppose that is true
<Fazana> Well, DUUUHH :o
<Morty> she has wistful window looking
<Sumica> 00,10well by then they had a rather large cast
<Sundaysmile> Armstrong vs Pinkie Pie
<Midnight_Tempest> thats just not fair Fazana... at least give god a chance
<Morty> thats tough work for a female anime character
<Sumica> 00,10it was like freaking ff3
<Fazana> God created this screwed up world, why should I give him a chance?
<MasterBrony> pinkie pie wins
<Midnight_Tempest> Sundaysmile: that would be pure chaos and you know it
<RAWRity> Sumica: yes, and while that certainly doesn't ruin the finale, it is a bit of a flaw when nearly every other supporting character got some kind of role.
<Sumica> 00,10actaly this whole anime reminds me of FF3
<PrototypeX9000> Sundaysmile: Armstrong will have heart attack
<Wrek> 05i have greek country bread buns sliced in 2 with sliced juicy cow, mozarrella otmatoes and ruccola
<Morty> wow
<Kencolt> Actually, God and Armstrong would become fast friends and Armstrong would be pleased with the quality beer God makes from nothing.
<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Wrek> 05with coke
<Sundaysmile> MANLY TEARS
<Morty> Wrek that sounds amazing
<Midnight_Tempest> squish
<Sundaysmile> LMAO
<PrototypeX9000> SPARKLE!
<Sundaysmile> ACCEPT HIS EMBRACE
<Morty> too hot?
<MasterBrony> @Wrek that sounds delicious
*Midnight_Tempest accepts Armstrong's embrace
<Fazana> Uhhh, I hear sparkles
<RAWRity> once we've finished this series, we need to watch the outtakes from the Dub.
<TrixieMuffin> Grrrrr my internet is such a pain in the flank , should have never switched
<RAWRity> "Grandma says we're having stew for dinner!" "FUCK YEAH!"
<Sundaysmile> damned technophiles
<Randomnerd> Why Winry, there's Nothing wrong with that...
<alexxm> is this full metal alchmist
<Midnight_Tempest> i wanna be made of automail... it would be awesome
<RAWRity> Gotta say, the tech in this world still confuses me.
<Randomnerd> Brotherhood.
<Sumica> 00,10it's steampunk it dont have to make sence.
<MasterBrony> does anypony here have a pic of Luna that would look good as a tattoo?
<RAWRity> I mean, we have fully autonomous prosthetic limbs, but still drive Model T's?
<Fazana> Derpy is automail
<Sumica> 00,10yeah my splash screen
<MasterBrony> my birthday is coming uo and thats what im tinking about getting
<PrototypeX9000> 6_9
<Randomnerd> MasterBrony: If you want a tattoo, you should consider the stylized Luna from the Intro to the pilot.
<Morty> ed is 15...i feel like ive wasted my life ;___;
<Fazana> Ed is 15?
<Fazana> He sounds like a 10 year old O_e
<RAWRity> eeyup.
<Sundaysmile> manly eavesdropping
<Randomnerd> Morty: To be fair, it's fiction. No one is this big a success at 15.
<Morty> beiber...
<MasterBrony> @randomnerd thats a really good idea
<Sumica> 00,10MasterBrony use this.
<Sundaysmile> yeah but beiber isn't talented at anything
<Randomnerd> Beiber is a celebrity, few live past 40.
<RAWRity> Morty: think about what you're saying. Do you wanna be Bieber?
<Midnight_Tempest> oh Edward... why cant you tell that Winry wants you... BAKA!
<Fazana> Beiber's special talent is having a high voice
<MasterBrony> use what?
<Morty> no I wanna be a writer ^-^
<PrototypeX9000> what is on stream i suppose...
<Fazana> Baka = idiot in Japanese
<Fazana> :3
<RAWRity> Morty: then fuckin' write brah.
<Sundaysmile> Likewise Morty
<Randomnerd> Eeyup.
<Midnight_Tempest> very good Fazana... you win an internet!
<Fazana> Yat
<Fazana> Yay&
<MasterBrony> do you have a llink to that pic?
<Morty> its very hard to make a living writing fiction though
<Fazana> I now have 9 internets :3
<RAWRity> but here's just a little tip: Get an education in something other than writing.
<MasterBrony> i want to save it and print it
<Sundaysmile> Morty, have a dayjob
<Sumica> 00,10I dont recall where i got it from.
<MasterBrony> dawwwwww
<Sumica> 00,10Shizuka <3
<Shizuka> 13sumica~<3
<Sundaysmile> If you write for necessity and not for fun, you'll lose interest quickly
<Fazana> I used to have about 100 internets, but I gave them all to Fluttershy.
<RAWRity> Because with rare exception, a degree in english will pay dick.
<MasterBrony> @sumica can you email the pic to me?
<Sumica> 00,10it might have been e361.....
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I could
<Sumica> 00,10some one linked it to me.
<Morty> sumica your ping...
<Sumica> 00,10waaaaah!
<Morty> -_-
<Morty> lol
<Randomnerd> MasterBrony: Might as well search for images of Luna + Fanart
<Midnight_Tempest> needs moar homunculus
<Fazana> Needs moar toaster
<RAWRity> Sundaysmile: it depends on what you're writing, and the writer themself really. Sometimes being put under pressure can get a writer to really work hard.
<Randomnerd> I realized that Glacier is really the only option pregnant ladies have for cosplay :-/
<Midnight_Tempest> dat Gluttony
<Sumica> 00,10they could go as Glutony =p
<Randomnerd> Ow.
<Morty> lol sumica
<ofna01> wtf iis this?
<Sumica> 00,10well r63 Gluttnoy
<Midnight_Tempest> no... NO!
<Randomnerd> Yeah... I hate myself for being an under-acheiver.
<Morty> what is 63?
<ofna01> booom
<Randomnerd> r63: Genderswapped fanart.
<alexxm> i thought that was 65
<Midnight_Tempest> Sumica... you have just given me a daymare... GAH!
<Sumica> 00,10mission acomplished
<Sundaysmile> no it's 63
<RAWRity> Envy is immune to Rule 63 though, as it's not clear WHAT gender they are.
<Sumica> 00,10Nani!
<Fazana> A female hargraive......*Cannot unsee*
<Randomnerd> What about the other Deadly Sins? Is there a Wrath, or Greed?
<Morty> Rawrity: I have seen fanart where it is clearly a girl or a boy
<Midnight_Tempest> r63 Mustang... i can see that
<RAWRity> Randomnerd: yes. all 7 show up at some point.
<Morty> isnt everything the reverse of nothing?
<RAWRity> Personally, Greed is my favorite Homonculus.
<Sumica> 00,10Greed is a badass
<alexxm> what's this show about
<Midnight_Tempest> i liked Wrath myself
<Midnight_Tempest> sparkle
<Morty> my favorite homunculus is probably pride
<djackson> what the hell is this
<Kencolt> I hate them all.
<Radu> This is ANIME
<RAWRity> alexxm: Humanoid creatures called homonculi are trying to destroy humanity, Blond kid and the suit of armor are brothers trying to figure out their plan.
<djackson> looks weird
<Fazana> That car had an epicface
<Kencolt> There's a limit to love and tolerance and the homunculi push it.
<RAWRity> It's pretty neat, actually.
<RAWRity> Also, kinda sad I wasn't here for the episode with Nina.
<Sumica> 00,10many tears were shed RAWRity
<Fazana> Twilight's human form....O_e
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<Sumica> 00,10more or less
<Kencolt> Oh, virtually everyone in this show is nuts. Just so you know.
<RAWRity> Fun Fact: Chimera's Cry was the first episode of the original FMA anime I saw. It's a wonder I watched further considering how fucked up it was.
<alexxm> that's what i thought Fazana
<Sumica> 00,10she also has crazy recall
<Midnight_Tempest> dat photographic memory
<Sumica> 00,10will take a bit> 5 days later
<Sundaysmile> what????

<alexxm> i propose that anyone who uses a vuvuzela be set on fire
<Stallion_of_War> BUCK1
<ScootaChicken> If I ever see Simon Cowell, I will punch him in the face.
<Cavy> Hey everypony.

<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: we have a show that's actually called "Hill Billy Hand Fishing" in which rednecks fish by sticking their hands into rivers and trying to get fish to bite their hands.

<Sumica> 00,10ed realy hates milk
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity...

<ScootaChicken> My god.
<ScienceLawnchair> Alicorn OCs are the worst.
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: yeah.
<Stallion_of_War> I'm already on fire.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Oh whoops, almost forgot
<otakon> well bc they're op
<ScienceLawnchair> With the addition of Cadence, there are THREE! alicorns.
<Sundaysmile> He grows a milimetre every 10 years

<alexxm> not much went to the apple store in kingston today
<Sundaysmile> Evil al
<Stallion_of_War> Sumica :D
<Stallion_of_War> BAHAHAHAHA!
<otakon> and mfw when I see catfisting
<ScienceLawnchair> What do you mean, RAWRity ?
<RAWRity> You remember that princess in the book in the latest episode? She was an alicorn if you look closely.
<Cavy> Haha Sumica.
<otakon> eeyup
<ScienceLawnchair> Alright four.
<otakon> she was
<Morty> that waah was so well timed
<ScootaChicken> oh god, four alicorns
<ScootaChicken> the Mary Sue has been doubled
<ScienceLawnchair> But there are only four.
<VUVUZELA> i never understood what a alicorn was
<otakon> which means that Celestia and Luna AREN'T the only Alicorns
<Sundaysmile> .....just walks away
<MasterBrony> im an alicorn.....
<ScootaChicken> although Luna and Celestia aren't really that Sue-y
<ScienceLawnchair> It still doesn't excuse Alicron OCs.
<Sumica> 00,10the book is't really canon thought
<RAWRity> VUVUZELA: It's a pony with wings and a unicorn horn.
<otakon> VUVUZELA: it's a horse with a unicorn horn and pegasus wings
<VUVUZELA> so like Celestia
<otakon> yh exactly
<RAWRity> Winry uses WRENCH. It's super effective.
<ScienceLawnchair> Alicorn OCs just mean you went full retard. Simple as that.
<Shizuka> 13oh there is someone with the nick vuvuzela...
<ScienceLawnchair> Right, enough venting.
<otakon> although alicorn originally just ment a unicorns horn
<MasterBrony> whats that suppossed to mean ScienceLawnchair?
<otakon> Shizuka: what now?
<MasterBrony> :|
<LordCelestia> 0,5Whats that mean Shizu?
<ScootaChicken> y'know, a couple days ago I saw someone with the nick 'rainbrodash'
<ScootaChicken> It made me realise just how much I miss him...
<ScienceLawnchair> Exactly what it says on the tin, MasterBrony
<ScienceLawnchair> Oh wait
<ScienceLawnchair> Not you again.
<Shizuka> 13was just wondering why we were in a loop of humorous definitions of vuvuzelas
<MasterBrony> you telling me im stupid?
*Stallion_of_War based his name off of Kratos from God of War, figured he'd have to be an Alicorn as they're the closest things to dieties in Equestria
<Shizuka> 13but we weren't, it was just a ping
<otakon> hmmm
<RAWRity> Shizuka: dat misunderstanding
<otakon> indeed
<Shizuka> 13eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyup
<VUVUZELA> wait i spealk vuvuzela wrong????
<Shizuka> 13brain, fried
<VUVUZELA> spealt
<VUVUZELA> *
<ScienceLawnchair> Shut up with the Alicorns already
<ScienceLawnchair> Cheese and Rice
<ScootaChicken> Stallion_of_War: if you really have to be an Alicorn oc, have your wings or horn chopped off
<Stallion_of_War> Cyborg is better Cyborn
<ScienceLawnchair> No one cares
<Stallion_of_War> *borg
<RAWRity> VUVUZELA: no, it's just that Shizu is tired and read it wrong.
<MasterBrony> i care science
<MasterBrony> i care
<ScootaChicken> but tbh alicorn oc's suck anyway.
<VUVUZELA> fuck it im going back to being moop
<MasterBrony> so dont trash peoples OC
<Scavender> Well, I going to call it a day and go to bed, Good night everypony. Have fun here.

<ScienceLawnchair> If you don't like it,then just deal with it.
<Morty> who cares?
<ScienceLawnchair> Grow some skin.
*Stallion_of_War 's non-Kratos OC war pony is a pegasus
<MasterBrony> sciencelawnchair is mad cause hes an earth pony, and not a special one either

<RAWRity> Earth Ponies are special in that they tend to have the least amount of Mary-sue OCs that can do everything ever and are amazing.
<otakon> eeyup
<MasterBrony> im saying hes not a SPECIAL earth pony
<otakon> oh
<MasterBrony> not that earth ponies arent special

<Fazana> I hope so :s
<Morty> both of them are based off real mary sues from fics i read :)
<moop> Sumica okay
<ScienceLawnchair> Alicorn OCs are stupid. Talking about OCs are stupid. You are all stupid. And now I'm stupid for talking about it.
<Morty> -_-
<Morty> leave troll
<RAWRity> ScienceLawnchair isn't a troll. He's just testy today
<ScienceLawnchair> Truth hurts, Morty. Ha ha!
<LordCelestia> 0,5ScienceLawnChair, your opinion is fine and all, but please, keep it to yourself rather than troll.
<LordCelestia> 0,5If not, take your trolling elsewhere.
<Morty> *talking about OC's IS stupid* trolls have bad grammar
<MasterBrony> OMG so muce AWESOME http://derpy.me/ZTthW
<Sundaysmile> I guess trolling really is a art
<Sumica> 00,10morty stop instangating
<ScienceLawnchair> Cool edit, bro.

<ScootaChicken> MasterBrony: stream, youtube links, allowed, not.
<Morty> no they are scootachicken
<RAWRity> dat Fuhrer
<MasterBrony> sciencelawnchair, do you want to go to the moon?
<Morty> just not for big streams
<Fazana> They are considered rude, but not against the rules
<MasterBrony> and what are you talking about ScootaChicken?
<Sumica> 00,10it's considdered impolite though
<Sundaysmile> :)
<RAWRity> Fuhrer Bradley > Hitler
<Fazana> Ha! Beat you to it!
<Syndicate> Hey...
<Syndicate> Can somepony help me out?
<ScootaChicken> Morty: From everything I've heard from mods, youtube links aren't allowed during any sort of stream
<Morty> Sumica just said
<moop> CCCP will rise again!!!
<KwakLad-> What's up Syndicate?
<MasterBrony> so did i screw up or not?
<ScienceLawnchair> Fuhrer President? That's a bit redundant, isn't it?
<Syndicate> :D
<ScootaChicken> indeed, I just said it in a more TL;DR way.
<ScienceLawnchair> Also, what do you need, Syndi-Cakes?
<Syndicate> Okay, does anypony know how to prevent Steam from loading as soon as you turn your computer on?
<Sumica> 00,10It's Fuhrer President King Bradly.
<moop> down with the old regime the left will rise!
<MasterBrony> @sumica did my link cross the line? did i screw up?
<KwakLad-> It's in steam settings Syndicate, can't tell you better sorry not at my pc
<Syndicate> Okay, I'll attempt to find it.
<ScootaChicken> MasterBrony: As I said, youtube links aren't allowed, doesn't matter what they are.
<ScienceLawnchair> Steam settings, Syndi-Cakes. Should be somewhere in there.
<Morty> Masterbrony you didn't even get kicked so im guessing you are fine
<ScootaChicken> well, youtube links aren't allowed during a stream.
<Fazana> Gimme a minute
<Sumica> 00,10Like I said it's considdered rude to poste youtube links but it's not a problem unless it's during events.
<MasterBrony> thats what i was trying to figure out
<Fazana> I'll do it without opening Steam
<Sundaysmile> lol leave by window
<Sumica> 00,10as in new eps schuduled events and movies nights
<MasterBrony> what qualifies as a legit strewam?
<Sundaysmile> ed looks like charlie brown
<KwakLad-> Why there never any tongues when I need them? -_-
<ScienceLawnchair> Steam -> Settings -> Interface tab -> Uncheck the box that says start on windows start up. Syndicate.
<Syndicate> Yeah, I got it.
<Syndicate> :3
<Morty> why is this hard to understand? Links are rude during stream, not allowed during events
<Syndicate> Thank you though.
<Syndicate> :D
<ScienceLawnchair> Good deal, then.
<MasterBrony> if the legit stream is on weekends, then what do you call the stream during the week?
<Sumica> 00,10entertainment
<Fazana> We are so bored we are gonna die stream
<Morty> ^
<PartyCannon> Au contraire, mon capitan! Heeee's back!
<RaveBrony> Good afternoon everypony!!
<MasterBrony> so now im reall confused
<RaveBrony> :)
<Syndicate> Heya RaveBrony!!!
<Syndicate> :D
<PartyCannon> RaveBrony why hello there :)
<MasterBrony> i cant post youtube links during the week?
<Sumica> 00,10so basickly any thing we schudule in advance is when the no link rule is in play
<Sumica> 00,10but it's prefered by most to not post them when there is a stream.
<MasterBrony> so was this sstream scheduled?
<MasterBrony> ok
<ScienceLawnchair> If there's a stream online, don't post youtube. It's simple as that.
<PartyCannon> Sumica So, like BMN and VRR?
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<PartyCannon> ah, danke :)
<RaveBrony> Omg!! Woot, who is bringing us this Amazing stream??
<Sumica> 00,10as well as new eps and any specal events like miazaki week.
<Fazana> Sumica I think
<MasterBrony> @sumica that clears it up....stream on, no youtube....but when IS youtube alright?
<ScienceLawnchair> I would say NewDCD, but I'm not sure who is streaming.
<ScootaChicken> MasterBrony: when nothing is streaming
<ScienceLawnchair> When there. . .isn't a stream.
<RaveBrony> Yeah
<ScootaChicken> or rather, when 'Loading Buffer: The Movie' is streaming
<Morty> this conversation is making me stupid
<MasterBrony> so a person drwing qualifies as a stream?
<ScienceLawnchair> Yes.
<RaveBrony> Yesterday there was no stream for like....5+ hours...lol
<ScootaChicken> because let's face it, that movie's been streamed here way too many times
<Fazana> Oh yeah
<RAWRity> the new Reverse Bel-air: http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzfvfjsg791qezg8qo1_500.png
<Fazana> I was about ready to die yesterday
<ScootaChicken> I mean, the original 'Loading Bar' movies weren't too bad
<ScienceLawnchair> Image links are ok.
<ScootaChicken> but the spinoffs and prequels have really started to get annoying
<Fazana> Haha
<ScienceLawnchair> Always ok.
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: but the remakes sucked shit.
<ScootaChicken> Exactly RAWRity, I dunno why they even did them in the first place
<RAWRity> ScootaChicken: money money money
<ScootaChicken> the 3D rereleases were a big enough cash grab as it was
<ScootaChicken> now they're just milking it
<Morty> videolinks are allowed during weekday streams, they are just rude because it implies that what's streaming isnt entertaining
<RAWRity> it's funny because the Phantom Menace rerelease bombed.
<ScootaChicken> Oh good.
<RaveBrony> Did it really?
<ScienceLawnchair> For the love of- Just don't post links when sometihng is streaming. That is not a hard concept to understand.
<RAWRity> i mean, THE VOW made nearly twice as much money at the box office.
<Sundaysmile> and then he was the death
<RaveBrony> :\
<kakorrhaphiophobia> :/
<Fazana> NOOOO!!! HUGHES
<ScootaChicken> Because meesa no likey the Phantom Menace, George Lucas, heesa un silly mandem
<Syndicate> Okay everypony, I have a question.

<kakorrhaphiophobia> whats sad?
<MasterBrony> SPOILER!!! hughes dies
<otakon> ban!
<otakon> BAN BAN BAN BAN BAN
<kakorrhaphiophobia> CAN CAN
<Syndicate> Do you think it is acceptable for someone to look at me and say: "Stop talking about the Jews, I'm a jew. Shut the f#ck up."
<Derpy_at_work> Hello ~
<Syndicate> And just be an all around flankhole?
<RAWRity> Syndicate: no.
<kakorrhaphiophobia> Syndicate: willl people hate me if i tell them im an atheist?
<Fazana> :(
<otakon> Syndicate: um, wait. Are they telling you to stop talking about the Jews or are you?
<Fazana> :'(
<Syndicate> They are.

<StinkomanFan> Last night I called Superbrony64 a motherbucker and now I'm back to face the music
<otakon> hiya Everlasting_Joy
<RAWRity> StinkomanFan: um...why?
<ScienceLawnchair> Syndicate: Just tell people to deal with it, and accept other peoples opinions.
<ScootaChicken> StinkomanFan: why would you do that?
<kakorrhaphiophobia> does any one know how to go back in time?
<ScienceLawnchair> Take a deep breath and appriciate life.
<ScootaChicken> SuperBrony64 is so loveable and silly
<Morty> i said something worse to wrek...he took my innocence ;__;

<kakorrhaphiophobia> DOES ANY ONE KNOW TIME TRAVEL THIS IS SERIOUS!!!
<Sumica> 00,10and if he did't punish you last night I dont think he plans on it.

<Dark_Horst> then why call it alchemy and not.... magic?
<RAWRity> you'll hve plenty of meat!
<LunarKing> thats just me
<Morty> eat the baby foxes!
<GLaDOS> Eat each other.
<RAWRity> Dark_Horst: because Alchemy sounds cooler.
<GLaDOS> Your meat.
<PartyCannon> meat != fish?
<LunarKing> cause it works similarry
<Dark_Horst> i see
<Fazana> Magci is well...magic.
<Fazana> Alchemy requires items
<RaveBrony> yeah
<Sumica> 00,10brotheryly nom
<PartyCannon> dat MEAT
<Sundaysmile> lol
<RaveBrony> ^
<Everlasting_Joy> Pfft, Bear Grylls would have this licked in no time.
<MasterBrony> i <3 ponies.....
<Jim> Zombies!
<Fazana> l2nom people
<MirrorImage> chocolate covered ants
<Yellowquiet> somone draw Bear Gryllz as a pony!
<Sundaysmile> formic acid
<RAWRity> basically, they refer to "Alchemy" as reconstituting matter into something else. Like you can buy the raw materials and elements that constitute the human body, and then create a human body.
<LunarKing> magic is using your own energy to create things out of thin air or control them at your will
*Sumica sings the circle of life
<LunarKing> alchemy uses items
<Sundaysmile> element of piss
<RaveBrony> dat insight
<PartyCannon> Is this real life? :3
<Morty> Dark_Horst it's fudementally different from magic. Magic is just to be able to do whatever you want, alchemy rearanges particles
<LunarKing> dem capes
<Fazana> Minecraft IRL
<Dark_Horst> alchemy is a crossform of chemistry and sorcery. which means mainly a lot of morons gassing themselves with lead while trying to fake creation of gold
<Sumica> 00,10now they are eating all things
*SuperBrony64 brings back String-Shredder and seats him in the chat
<Morty> lol
<otakon> hmm
<Dark_Horst> what i've seen so far are flashy circles and hands out of nowhere. i'm not convinced
<otakon> my stream froze
<Sumica> 00,10Just what were you two doing?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O__o
<Everlasting_Joy> Circle of life folks.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Nothing.
<otakon> Dark_Horst: it's 6 eps in, you didn't see character development
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:>
<String-Shredder> quit pulling me around SuperBrony64!
<Sumica> 00,10lol no it's 12 eps in
*SuperBrony64 hugs String-Shredder
<otakon> damn I lost track it seems
*String-Shredder hugs SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:3
<PartyCannon> Silly idealists!
<RaveBrony> O.o
<LunarKing> i should go to sleep
<Sumica> 00,10MEAT
<LunarKing> FAIL
<otakon> damn it NOW I'm getting lag
<LunarKing> nevermind
<RAWRity> Dark_Horst: the circles are their form of alchemy. Meanwhile, the Clapping hands thing is actually explained later.
<otakon> always around 4 pm or so
<Sumica> 00,10dat spin
<LunarKing> i remember it differently for some reason
<otakon> it seems I get lag
<RaveBrony> dat pwnage
<Yellowquiet> lol
<Fazana> Did I sense a desu there?
<PartyCannon> otakon IKR?
<LunarKing> Ed learned to fly
<otakon> yh
<otakon> blargh
<Shizuka> 13oh my... new minecraft snapshot just doubled the height limit
<otakon> brb need to check my laundry
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/RLiZd.png
<otakon> um what's the point?
<otakon> you go down, not up in Minecraft from what I know about it
<Jim> heh, inb4 cities in the sky
<otakon> um
<otakon> CAN you build on clouds?
<otakon> damn it LAG
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Shizuka> 13they move through blocks
<otakon> so it doesn't matter
<MasterBrony> shizuka
<otakon> so WHY double the height?
<Shizuka> 13because tall builds are awesome
<Shizuka> 13now i can build the Citadel properly
<otakon> bugger all STUPID DAMN LAG!
<Jim> Imagine a HUGE tower
<MasterBrony> do you the MLP mod for minecraft?>
<Shizuka> 13no..
<Dark_Horst> the low ceiling in minecraft has been a problem many already run into
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - wait, new build goes to 256 blocks high?
<Shizuka> 13they're changing level formats
<MirrorImage> where's the information on this build?
<ScootaChicken> I bought minecraft a couple days ago
<UnFoundBug> the entirity of the extra height is going into the sky as well
<Shizuka> 13new format has height limit of 256 (terrain gen still works on 128 though) and some 4000 block types possible
<ScootaChicken> my life has died.
<UnFoundBug> shame really
<RaveBrony> :(
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - sauce plox?
<Morty> :'(
<UnFoundBug> Shizuka, jebs adding some of the forge core code into the main game
<UnFoundBug> finally
<Shizuka> 13http://www.mojang.com/2012/02/15/minecraft-snapshot-12w07a/
<Shizuka> 13i've heard cubic chunks are still not in though, but from what i can tell air blocks will be compressed out entirely, so 16x16x256 chunks won't be sending that much more data
<Morty> I guess Izumi doesn't have the GUTS for this sort of thing?
<Yellowquiet> i need to buy the manga *:*
<Dark_Horst> minecraft has oompa loompas now?
<Fazana> They have since 1.8
<alexxm> did i miss much
<LunarKing> well, good night
<UnFoundBug> im not looking forward to the next update mod wise, gonna take ages for everyone to catch up
<PartyCannon> Shizuka dat new save format
<alexxm> night LunarKing
<UnFoundBug> Hopefully, the saves should convert
<UnFoundBug> like when they added compression
<UnFoundBug> just a load of standing time while they ported over
<Shizuka> 13yeah, the conversion will happen automatically
<Morty> hoenheim is best hoenheim
<MasterBrony> imma go play minecraft
<Everlasting_Joy> brb.
<MasterBrony> but ping me if you wanna talk :)
<Shizuka> 13it's not in the official release channel yet, still waiting on 1.2
<Sumica> 00,10Technic pack needs to update already.
<CriticKitten> So glad they made Brotherhood. I think it turns out in every way superior to the original anime.
<Morty> MasterBrony
<MasterBrony> yea?
<Morty> :>
<Morty> hi :>
<UnFoundBug> Sumica, pretty much all the mods are updated seperately
<MasterBrony> hi?
<MasterBrony> whats up?
<alexxm> what's happened so far
<UnFoundBug> why not just put the pack together yourself
<UnFoundBug> its easy enough
<Morty> i wub woo /)^3^(\
<Sumica> 00,10Yes i know but none of them are updating.
<String-Shredder> i hate the pocket edition of minecraft. you cant craft anything!!!!!!!!!
<UnFoundBug> really, BC/IC/EE are all 1.1
<MasterBrony> i wub woo too? /)^3^(\
<UnFoundBug> and BC/EE just released major updates as well
<MasterBrony> back to minecraft
<Jim> She's mad
<Sumica> 00,10ah I must have missed that, havent checked in a bit.
<UnFoundBug> heh, i usually hold back on moving between versions till Modloader, modloaderMP and forge are all over
<GLaDOS> Meow.
<Sumica> 00,10will have to set that up here after work and see if I can get my server running again. Or just have wrek put them on his. Cause you know his server is cooler.
<UnFoundBug> his server is also up now
<Fazana> AGH, tenticles
<ScienceLawnchair> No pressure or anything.
<GLaDOS> Teeeeeeesticles..
<Fazana> I was thinking tenticles...........
<UnFoundBug> though if in creative mode without admin, it boots you if you try to spawn in blocks
<Morty> i love this guy
<UnFoundBug> except if you had them before moving to creative
<Morty> he is best old guy

<alexxm> sorry to here bout that String-Shredder
<otakon> also
<otakon> mfw I SWEAR I heard Usopp
<String-Shredder> YoUR FACE GODDAMNIT
<CriticKitten> And then Scar became Horatio Caine
<otakon> no seriously, I am POSITIVE that Yoki is done by Usopps Voice Actor
<RAWRity> Incoming BEST HOMONCULUS
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> too bad he gets so little actual screen time in this one
<Yellowquiet> lol
<ScienceLawnchair> Seems legit.
<RAWRity> nah, Ling/Greed works too.
<String-Shredder> i have no stream right now. somepony link me to it?
<otakon> hmmm
<RAWRity> Doesn't that technically count as rape to Al?
<otakon> <script type="text/javascript"> fid="GuruGuruMawaru"; v_width="500"; v_height="300";</script><script type="text/javascript" src="http://veemi.com/javascript/embedPlayer.js"></script>
<otakon> that should be it
<UnFoundBug> really?
<UnFoundBug> embed code?
<otakon> hey, thats the best I could do in 10 seconds
<UnFoundBug> fair enoguh
<otakon> I'm not friggin Rainbow Dash
<CriticKitten> I like Ling's Greed better myself, anyways.
<MirrorImage> otakon - what were you trying to do?
<otakon> link him the Veemi stream directly
<otakon> damn it so much FUCKING LAG
<MirrorImage> why not link him to the bronystate javascript file?
<otakon> I don't know how
<otakon> I have ZERO inkling on where to find it or how to interpret it
<Sumica> 00,10this will be the last ep for today.
<UnFoundBug> http://www.veemi.com/watch?v=GuruGuruMawaru
<otakon> neat trick
<Yellowquiet> lol OP
<pony_5382> no ponies
<Snakkkeeeeees> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<UnFoundBug> direct link to current stream
<CriticKitten> Pretty sure I'd lose control of my bowels if somepony did that right in front of me.
<MirrorImage> how theraputic for him
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: good thing Al doesn't have any bowels
<CriticKitten> Inorite
<RAWRity> otherwise that snake-lady would be very uncomfortable
<Everlasting_Joy> He he he.
<Everlasting_Joy> Complete global saturation.
<Sumica> 00,10Some day Everlasting_Joy, someday
<Everlasting_Joy> :D
<Sumica> 00,10rage face
<BronyZilla> Rofl.
<CriticKitten> Dat rae
<CriticKitten> g.
<CriticKitten> :p
<MirrorImage> big temper. little package.
<BronyZilla> Methinks he is over-reacting just a tad.
<Sumica> 00,10love that slow clap
<Fazana> HAHAH
<Fazana> This show is funny :)
<CriticKitten> Boot to the head!
<Everlasting_Joy> Kick their butts!
<BronyZilla> :D
<Kammerjunk> Buck their flanks!
<Kammerjunk> Wait, that actually sounds like it has a double-meaning.
<Sumica> 00,10nice move
<Fazana> It does O_e
<Kammerjunk> Luna-darned innuendos.
<Kammerjunk> So yeah. I just stopped lurking for a moment to tell you all that you're awesome.
<Kammerjunk> I'll go back to my fics now.
<Sumica> 00,10lawl oki Kammerjunk, have fun
<Yellowquiet> hf Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Will do.
<BronyZilla> Cya.
<Jim> Have fun Kammerjunk
<Morty> i have a theory about greed going full armor
<BronyZilla> Yes?
<Morty> i think it uses up stone power, just like healing
<otakon> hmm maybe
<Morty> thats the only reason he wouldnt use it all the time
<BronyZilla> Perhaps...
<otakon> but if that was the case, wouldn't ANY of the homunculi have that limitation too?
<BronyZilla> Brohoof!
<Yellowquiet> XD
<otakon> Morty: why do you bring it up?
<Morty> i was trying to figure out why he didnt do that vs wrath and thats all i got
<Morty> seeing him use it reminded me
<otakon> Morty: bc he can't heal and armor up at the same time
<otakon> one has to come after the other
<otakon> and he was cocky for another reason
<Morty> otakon: why would he need to heal if he used it the whole fight?
<otakon> Morty: he was COCKY
<Morty> otakon i think im reffering to a fight you havent seen
<otakon> he didn't realize what Wrath was is all
<Morty> its near the end
<otakon> besides
<Rainbow> Heck yeah
<Morty> and he definately respected his opponent
<otakon> it's two chemical reactions
<otakon> well two different chemical reactions
<CriticKitten> Boot to the bucking HEAD
<otakon> so one has to take place before the other
<Rainbow> Animie crap
<Yellowquiet> LAWWL
<Morty> i think they cant be used at the same time cause they both take up stone
<RaveBrony> :o
<otakon> and that's all for today folks
<BronyZilla> That was good.
<Rainbow> :$
<Yellowquiet> housewifes FTW
<Jim> But I want more :O
<BronyZilla> I liked the Brohoof.
<Rainbow> I just joined
<Rainbow> And that was it
<Yellowquiet> more ! ^^
<Sumica> 00,10Sorry guys I have work in an hour
<Jim> Ultimate brohoof of doom ^^
<otakon> Morty: still if that's the case ANYTIME a Homunculi uses their ability it would do it
<Fazana> You CANNOT leave us on a cliffhanger!
<Yellowquiet> ok Sumica :(
<otakon> Sumica: thanks man, that was damn enjoyable
<Fazana> :[
<Wrek> 05well that was awesome
<PartyCannon> Sumica thanks for the stream :)
<Fazana> Ohai Wrek
<Sumica> 00,10if the stream is free there will be more.
<otakon> indeed, thank you Sumica
<Yellowquiet> thx for the stream
<Sumica> 00,10tomarrow that is
<BronyZilla> Damn timezones, it's 9:30 here.

<Fazana> Same.
<RaveBrony> Hi there Wrek!
<Sumica> 00,10it's 130pm here
<Rainbow> 4:31 here
<UnFoundBug> BronyZilla, uk ftw
<Jim> And now I have another series to watch all of a sudden
<otakon> but the friggin mail hasn't shown up YET
<Sumica> 00,10I work swing shift
<Morty> otakon, not necessarily. greed has an especially cheap power
<Jim> how many seasons are there of FMA?
<CriticKitten> Kewl. Hopefully I won't miss episode 19. :3
<BronyZilla> Yeep. :D
<Morty> for being a normal homunculus
<CriticKitten> Ep 19 is best ep. :D
<otakon> Morty: all he does is harden his bones and flesh to diamond hardness
<Yellowquiet> Sumica: at what time tomorrow ?
<Fazana> Such. Manlyness.
<Sumica> 00,10depends on if I get up early or not
<Rainbow> IF ONLY
<Rainbow> Epic Battle Fantasy was a show
<Sumica> 00,10and if some one beats me to the stream
<Saturn> 08,01http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/251/012/7ee.pngAAAAAA
<Yellowquiet> Sumice : ok
<Morty> yeah...thats pretty intense compared to long nails
<Yellowquiet> Sumica*
<otakon> Morty: Lust does the same kind of thing, except hers is into a single point for a "Ultimate Spear"
<Saturn> 08,01whoops
<Saturn> 08,01i mean
<Fazana> Right
<Saturn> 08,01http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/251/012/7ee.png
<otakon> nice Luna
<Jim> Can't see what's in tha link Saturn
<Yellowquiet> Sumica : hf fun working ;D
<Fazana> I require items of nutrional value, so afk
<UnFoundBug> deniiiiieed
<Yellowquiet> bye all!
<BronyZilla> Lol, cool pic.
<otakon> Jolly Good Derp Fine Sir
<PartyCannon> dat API return
<Rainbow> PEAH ENG GEAH
<otakon> bye Yellowquiet
<Sumica> 00,10I will try
*Yellowquiet hugs everypony
<Jim> bye Yellowquiet
<BronyZilla> Cya!
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care Yellowquiet.
<PartyCannon> Yellowquiet laters :)
<Saturn> 08,01hey! hey you! psst! you! yes, you!
<RAWRity> GUYS.
<otakon> indeed take care
<otakon> me?
<Yellowquiet> sweet dreams ^^
<RAWRity> GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS
<Rainbow> I had a horrible hearts and hooves day
<Saturn> 08,01do you like fluttershies?
<RAWRity> HEY
<Rainbow> So did my friend
<otakon> um yes
<Saturn> 08,01http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/045/6/6/a_wild_fluttershy_appeared_by_greyewolf-d4psigu.png
<otakon> who doesn't?
<KwakLad> there no stream?
<Rainbow> I like fluttershies
<UnFoundBug> wow
<Morty> otakon, in greedling vs wrath, wrath had no way to hurt greed if he went full armor
<Rainbow> I love them
<RAWRity> MY BLINGBAGS THAT I ORDERED JUST CAME IN THE MAIL.
<Wrek> 05why am I awake?
<Morty> but he didnt
<UnFoundBug> thats a nice fluttershy
<PartyCannon> Saturn if I could, I'd have like 12 of them :3
<Jim> Wrek: Because you can
<KwakLad> Wrek because you love us
<Morty> im just trying to find an explanation
<RAWRity> NOW I'M GOING TO OPEN THEM AND TELL YOU WHAT I GOT.
<Wrek> 05so if there's no stream i can sketch a little
<BronyZilla> I'm drawing manga! Practicing anyway... not that good.
<Wrek> 05if wanted that is
<RAWRity> 1st: Pinkie Pie recolor called Flower Wishes
<Saturn> 08,01why is fluttershy so appealing?
<KwakLad> Wrek your drawing is always appreciated i think.
<otakon> Morty: true, but he didn't bc he has COCKY and he underestimated his opponent. He might be able to go full armor and such, but he has to heal his wounds first to do it. And HEALING however takes up stone power.
<PartyCannon> Saturn because of her *squee* IMO
<RAWRity> 2nd: CRYSTAL Pinkie Pie!
<Wrek> 05well you need to tell me if you want me to sketch for an hour or so
<Saturn> 08,01PartyCannon: but what gives her that *squee* factor?
<BronyZilla> Love that sqee sound effect.
<Morty> otakon: go watch the fight and tell me he was cocky
<NovedCheese> hi
<Rainbow> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=s2CXE9tDxHs#t=31s
<Saturn> 08,01and why is that appealing to so many people?
<KwakLad> Wrek i want it :p
<Rainbow> I used to love fluttershy
<RaveBrony> Wrek!! Draw! Now!!
<Sumica> 00,10Do it wrek.
<RaveBrony> plz :$
<Morty> besides, ling was in control
<Rainbow> but after that I simply ADORE HER
<otakon> Morty are we talking first fight or Ling Greed?
*Saturn 08,01feels that there's a sociology essay in here somewhere
<RAWRity> 3rd and Final: RAINBOW DASH!
<RaveBrony> Draw! Draw Draw! Draw! Draw! Draw! Draw!
<RAWRity> ...if only I'd gotten a Rarity. :(
<Morty> greedling vs wrath near the finale
<PartyCannon> Saturn methinks it triggers our reaction to seeing cute things, similar to seeing a cat (my reaction to Fluttershy is similar to my adorable cat) :)
<BronyZilla> ...
<otakon> Morty: human bodies work a little less effectively then a Homunculus body that's why. He COULDN'T go full armor from what I know of the process of what happened
<UnFoundBug> still no luna gear, and still no cheap UK shipping
<BronyZilla> Meh.
<Saturn> 08,01hot damn, we're still watching FMA?
<RaveBrony> RAWRity where did you get the blind bags? and how much?
<Fazana> Yeah
<Wrek> 05we were
<Morty> otakon: he went full armor right after the fight
<Fazana> They really need to do some UK shirts
<RAWRity> RaveBrony: Amazon for 3 bucks a pop. But...now the price has jumped up on em to like 8 Bucks a piece.
<Fazana> I would totally buy a Fluttershy shirt :3
<BronyZilla> I wonder if there are any UK shops that sell Pony t-shirts. I can't find any.
<otakon> Morty: show for christs sake, I can't do a convo on this in conjecture
<Phase4> morning everyone
<RaveBrony> Aw damn! :(
<Rainbow> Who wants cake?
<Morty> me

<Octavias_Pride> im guessing Wrek is drawing?
<Fazana> What's with the other Pinkie pie with Suprise coloured mane and tail?
<otakon> um
<Rainbow> Pinkie was originally supposed to be Suprise
<otakon> that's Suprise
<Fazana> I know that
<Ingwaz> i dont have any of the mane 6
<RaveBrony> But hey, does the OC have to be something like from pony creator?
<Fazana> But it isn't Pinkie
<otakon> Pinkies prototype
<Rainbow> Thats why her first word was SUPRISE
<CCCP> I wish my name was as cute as the ponies in MLP are
<Phase4> i like how they use pinkie art on "flow wishes" but the actual model is different
<RAWRity> Fazana: you refering to the purple Pinkie recolor?
<RAWRity> that's Flower Wishes, apparently.
<otakon> RaveBrony: no, but it makes it easier for us with ZERO computer drawing tools
<Fazana> I got a message, but I no can see :c
<RaveBrony> Ah, so it cant be just hand drawn? hmmmmmmm
<RAWRity> Phase4: no, the model is the same.
<Rainbow> ..
<Fazana> Someone sent me a message
<alexxm> no idea what flavor these are any suggestions http://pictureisunrelated.memebase.com/2012/01/11/wtf-photos-videos-doritos-more-enjoyable-than-crushed-balls/#comments

<Phase4> pinkies hair looks a little pinkamena for me
<Rainbow> ...
<Dark_Horst> looks like someone's got inspired by FMA?
<Jim> alexxm: Pictureisunrelated is not good for your brain ^^
<Fazana> The point is, the pony on the left looks lie pinkie, but isn't Pinkie OR Suprise
<Wrek> 05Sumica
<Rainbow> I'm guessing those chips are man flavored, alexxm
<Sumica> 00,10Yeah wrek?
<Fazana> I know
<Ingwaz> alexxm, thats actually a favorite wrestling move of children, as you can imagine...its very painful
<Fazana> Armstrong favoured :)
<Wrek> 05cubernetics are hard to draw :C
<Wrek> 05y*
<Sumica> 00,10indeed
<RaveBrony> :o
<Fazana> They taste of manlyness
<RAWRity> Fazana: yes. that's because to make more figures to be collected, they took the 5 basic pony models, recolored them, and came up with names for them.
<RaveBrony> You can do it Wrek!
<Fazana> Ahh
<RAWRity> it's also why FLuttershy and Rainbow Dash have the same model.
<Sumica> 00,10Big mac as Armstrong.

<Randomnerd> Syndicate: It's an axe and a mattock, it's pretty useful :3
<Syndicate> Otakon: it's not like they're fast enough to get you anyway. You know you need a melee weapon and that's the bet of the best.
<otakon> SuperBrony64: mine did too earlier, had a bunch of updates to install it seems
<PrototypeX9000> :D
<PrototypeX9000> Need opinions...What melee wepon is best for zombie apocolypse?

<RAWRity> CCCP: because you touch yourself at night
<PrototypeX9000> i can see that as one of the best
<CCCP> RAWRity: i touch my self in the morning too
<Randomnerd> A long crowbar, asid from being a useful tool, has a nice "business end", and no moving parts.
<Gold> 99%!
<PrototypeX9000> best time of day, CCCP
<PrototypeX9000> lmao
