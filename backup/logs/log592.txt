<Sylandest> morning, MegaMoonShine :)
<AdamTheDuck> And I was thinking one of the Kerbals will find a trojan horse and disguise himself to escape the wrath of Phase
<AdamTheDuck> or maybe use the window logo to break a hole into the monitor
<dentidiot> whats the original game about?
<AdamTheDuck> Well if you watch some of Phase's streams, you build spaceships
<AdamTheDuck> and try and send these green guys
<AdamTheDuck> called kerbals to the moon and stuff
<dentidiot> hmm dosent sound too bad
<AdamTheDuck> Think spore
<AdamTheDuck> but physics apply your ships
<dentidiot> in space?
<dentidiot> right, ill have to look it up
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah
<AdamTheDuck> dentidiot: But because you end up experimenting with different ship designs, Kerbals are always killed in the process of a test launch
<dentidiot> so the better and more efficient you are the less kerbals are killed
<AdamTheDuck> And I think Wrek just plays to kill kerbals in the most imaginative way possible
<AdamTheDuck> No kerbals aren't a major thing in the game
<dentidiot> but there an extra incentive?
<AdamTheDuck> All you're really doing is trying to see how well your designs fly
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah that little effort to keep your kerbal/kerbals alive
<dentidiot> or kill them, dosent matter xD
<AdamTheDuck> Sometimes you can get your kerbal stranded on the moon
<AdamTheDuck> yeah Wrek just kills them all xD
<dentidiot> GOOD IDEA
<AdamTheDuck> There is always something about rebellion type stories/games that just warm my heart
<AdamTheDuck> Only to see everyone die horribly
<dentidiot> prinny anyone? xD
<dentidiot> too obsure right
<AdamTheDuck> Prinny?
<dentidiot> yesh
<dentidiot> well im gonna go seeya everypony :)
<Sylandest> laters, dentidiot
<MegaMoonShine> Cya dentidiot :)
<AdamTheDuck> Cya dentidiot
<Wrek|Observiking> 05FUCk
<AdamTheDuck> Wait.. was it wrek or sumica who kills kerbals?
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck: sumica
<AdamTheDuck> Oh that's right...
<AdamTheDuck> How many mods stream on BronyState?
<AdamTheDuck> I only know Phase, Wrek and the Allegro and Giga podcast
<TheRandomkid321> I'm Back biches. I had to do something for a bit.
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back
<TheRandomkid321> SuperBrony64 used to stream didnt he?
<AdamTheDuck> I'm never on when he does I think >.<
<AdamTheDuck> Think I saw him stream Black Ops once though
<TheRandomkid321> I just havnt seen one of his streams in ages. WHich is upsetting because he was always my favorite streamer.
<alexxm> chat derped
<TheRandomkid321> alexxm I thought it was silence.
<AdamTheDuck> Who streams at the movie nights?
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321: Most mods can stream, And some does when they have time. But there are the more regular streamers then the others who are around usually
<dalekahn> Adam: normaly it is suumica who streams movie night
<AdamTheDuck> Cool
<TheRandomkid321> Im gonna take a wild guess here and say that wrek is streaming?
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah
<Vordox> Such a total war...
<Vordox> WWITH PONIES
<killerpony7733> TheRandomkid321: What gave it away?
<Kandarihu> Is it going in slow motion for anypony else or just me?
<AdamTheDuck> Slow motion or jittery?
<Kandarihu> It seems to go in slow motion, and skips every few seconds.
<Kandarihu> I'm on my old computer and I'm XDCCing files 3 at a time.
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm it's going normal for me.
<AdamTheDuck> Well that may explain it :P
<Vordox> Wrek's so in perile

<TheRandomkid321> I am good at sketching human anatomy... Pony anatomy though... UNfortunatly no... That would be pretty cool though...
<AdamTheDuck> but you don't have to draw hands :3
<Wrek|Observiking> 05that went well :3
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and yeah i realize this isnt the most exciting thing to watch
<Wrek|Observiking> 05but its an waesome game
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck Usually I hide the hands fromt he image such as having the person hiding behind something partially or hands in pockets.
<Chezne> pretty awesome for me to watch anyway, love these types of games
<TheRandomkid321> Does this game have multiplayer. It would be pretty cool if so
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321: Yeah but when your logo design for a VCD assignment involves a clear hand and you spend 50 sketches trying to get the fingers right...
<Chezne> This is Starfarer correct? single-player only if so
<killerpony7733> Chezne: yep
<TheRandomkid321> its 11 where I am mates. I gotta hit the hay... Then mayby sleep after I am done beating the hay sensless.

<Vordox> Know what would be awesome...
<Quick_Thinker> even though that would be impossible to have a middle hoof
<Vordox> This is 3D enviroment or in cockpit/ship RPG
<Vordox> But the gameplay to be in 2D
<Vordox> Like current
<Vordox> WOULD BE AWESOME
<Wrek|Observiking> 05there
<Wrek|Observiking> 05now my main battleship has all the newest weaponry
<Vordox> Big Mac ready to be sailed, Commander Wrek!
*Bronysith glomps Vordox in the shins
<Quick_Thinker> how the hell did it get upgrades on the fly man the future kicks ass
*Vordox does a spin in air and lands stationary, still in Salute.
<Vordox> What about our own Star Cruiser ship, Commander Wrek?
<Dermathil> fun fact: my crusader kigns 2 game right now is pretty darn hard. Playing as a catholic heretic in iceland who also managed to take over the canary islands through good marriages and assassinations.
<Vordox> Not worthwhile to upgrade at the current time, Commander?
<Quick_Thinker> Vordox if Wrek told you to jump into space without spacesuit would you do it?
<Vordox> Quick_Thinker: Of course not Sir.
<Quick_Thinker> Sir huh guess im a commander to :D
<Quick_Thinker> BIGEST MISTAKE EVER
<Vordox> War front incoming, pirate fleet
<Vordox> ALL MAN THE STATIONS! We're going in!
<Vordox> Commander Wrek, fleet is ready!
<Quick_Thinker> ^ is getting a bit to much into this
<Vordox> Quick_Thinker: Don't bucking care.

<Vordox> shana: Anything on the internet older then 2 hours is old.
<Alchemist> its not leaked OC, it was written by mandopony
<Vordox> Recharged Shields, at optimal lux.
<Dermathil> Vordox: ponies are old?

<Vordox> Dermathil: Since 1980s, yes
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6463377408
<Vordox> 3 o'clock or 8 o'clock, your decision, Commander Wrek.
<Eli> Hi all

<Vordox> Wrek: YOu need to draw a cockpit with you as Commander of it with a crew. :P
<RaveBrony> :o
<RaveBrony> Id like to see that :D
<MegaMoonShine> That'd be awesome
<Vordox> I think Wrek would like it too :P
<Vordox> That's why I suggested him into a vision of it.
<Vordox> I would gladly be a cockpit member. :)
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6469775104
<Dermathil> Hehehe... Duchess Lauren of Orkney has inherited the County of Caithness and all lower titles. (She's my daughter in Crusader Kings 2)
<Vordox> Are you able to upgrade your main ships propulsion?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05yeah but it would take weapon space
<Vordox> Dang
<Bronysith> weapons are best pony
<Wrek|Observiking> 05besides now i have a strong enough fleet to tackle most things. now i can save up for the real capitol ships
<RaveBrony> :o
<Underpony> do I hear something about a space RTS?
<Vordox> ATTACK CORPORATE
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I need to not listen to pony music while sleeping
<MegaMoonShine> Why not, Alpha-Omega-Prime?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05lets see what the high end stuffcosts
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Well I wake up to a song I like and start singing it
<Eli> Wrek|Observiking: what's the music you're playing now called?' i like it

<Applechip> Has anypony tried the space rts Sword of the Stars 2?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Now I only have 3 hours of sleep
<Chezne> haven't played that in.... forever
<MegaMoonShine> Are all those things meant to be ships?
<MegaMoonShine> In the circle
<Wrek|Observiking> 05yeah
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its my fleet
<MegaMoonShine> Ahh, thought so
<Wrek|Observiking> 05miniature versions of allt he ships i own
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> ....?
<Vordox> Are you able to replace your main ship with something else?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05yeah once i find one
<Wrek|Observiking> 05you can set which one to be your main
<Vordox> Coooool
<MegaMoonShine> That is pretty cool
<Dermathil> I'm having so much fun right now. I've been declared to be the chancellor of Norway for the nth time since my diplomacy score is 10 points above the "masterful" rank (which is 15)...
<Wrek|Observiking> 05playign civ or?
<MegaMoonShine> Some game called Crusader Kings 2
<CCCP> hello everypony
<Barbetos|AtWork> Hey CCCP
<CCCP> hi Barbetos|AtWork
<alexxm> how you doing CCCP
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Hi CCCP
<killerpony7733> CCCP: Hiya :3
<MegaMoonShine> hello CCCP :)
<cachi01> morning bronystate =D
<MegaMoonShine> morning cachi01 :)
<Chrysalis> 'mornin
<cachi01> hi MegaMoonShine and Chrysalis :)
<Wrek|Observiking> 05time for a massive fleet attack
<alexxm> how you doing cachi01 and Chrysalis
<RainBowJack> hi cachi01
<CCCP> MHi alexxm Alpha-Omega-Prime killerpony7733 MegaMoonShine cachi01 Chrysalis and everypony
<cachi01> hi alexxm im cool thx for asking and you?
<alexxm> i'm good cachi01
<cachi01> hi RainBowJack and CCCP!
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I feel like my long name is a nuisance
<RainBowJack> AOP
<Dark92Whatever> I hate it when that internet derp happens
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> hmm?
<alexxm> it happens
<Dermathil> yeah I'm playing Crusader Kings 2 wrek. Politics in the 11th century on a character-by-character basis. Goal is to make your dynasty be as successful as possible. made by Paradox Games.
<cachi01> d
<cachi01> ed
<cachi01> chat?
<alexxm> seems like it
<Dermathil> probably.
<Vordox> So Wrek. Thinking about a drawing of you commanding inside a Cockpit? :P
<Wrek|Observiking> 05its itneresting :P
<Vordox> But it requires heavy background focus
<Dermathil> Not inside a cockpit. He'd be standing on the main bridge of a mothership darth-vader style
<Vordox> X
<Dermathil> (without the evil that is)
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> garagebanf is fun to mess with
<Vordox> I'm not sure that's the thing he's thinkng off.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> -band
<Vordox> Wait till Wrek atleast has a chance to ight against capitol fleets...
<Vordox> It'
<Vordox> It'll be like a celebration :P
<cachi01|CaveStory> yay moar cave story for me
<Wrek|Observiking> 05that fleet has 3 capitol ships
<Wrek|Observiking> 05several carriers
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and a shitload of fighters
<Vordox> Hope you saved, Wrek XD
<Dermathil> I'm slowly working towards icelandic independence from Norway.
*Alpha-Omega-Prime does not like microstradegy games
<alexxm> seems like you could take on a small fleet
<Dermathil> Alpha-Omega-Prime: would you rather prefer political grand strategy games?
<Wrek|Observiking> 05goan save to 90k
<Wrek|Observiking> 05and egt a level 1 capitol ship
<Vordox> Of 3 levels?
*Alpha-Omega-Prime Does not like any strategy game
<Wrek|Observiking> 05yeh
<Vordox> Isn't it better to aim for Level 3 Cap ship for 150k?
<Vordox> It's just 60k more
<Vordox> Better aim for the highest due to a non curving income
<Wrek|Observiking> 05you see the ship doesnt have any equipment
<Wrek|Observiking> 05so the total cost ends much higher
<Vordox> Oh...
<Vordox> Not able to replace the current main ships weapons to it?
<Vordox> ooooh
<Vordox> KILL DA PIRATEZ
<Vordox> Why isn't your ship fleet called "The Vikings?" :P
<CCCP> Vordox but YOU are a pirate
<Vordox> We ARE Vikings!
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Cause vikings my good friend
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Yay for scandinavians :P
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Also a reason why I don't like Halo Wars
<Dermathil> ...I'm surprised. Ireland hasn't united yet and I'm in the 1120s (started in 1066). I could potentially try to get a cassus belli there and get a beachhead. Potentially could get access to mercenaries through that. (strangely Iceland can't get any mercenaries)
<RainBowJack> killerpony7733 : you must have like the game Lost Vikings then
<Vordox> killerpony7733: We're a friendly bunch of peo PILLAGE AND MAIN AND MURDER- ple and we're quite passive as long as we don't get atta MURDER THE SCUMS THAT ENGAGE US-cks us.
<killerpony7733> RainBowJack: Actually never played it sadly
<Barbetos|AtWork> http://static.tumblr.com/rh7q7yc/vXxm38z8m/you-are-a-pirate-2.gif
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Yep, we were once terrifying but now we are one of the most nicest known people in the world sorta :D
<Vordox> killerpony7733: We're like Canadians.
<Vordox> We are NOT angry, just slightly.
<Dermathil> Someone called the french canadian?
<Vordox> There's a reason Canada is part Vikings. :P
<alexxm> so does this game cost much
<Dermathil> brb shower time.
<Barbetos|AtWork> talking about the brony community? Or pirates?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Whats the difference?
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Still the viking blood rage still lurks around in many danes and other scandinavians
<Vordox> We can have outburst and become savages still. :P
<Vordox> It's trying to retreat, Commander!
<Vordox> We're catching up, Engaging!
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Tell me about it,
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :S
<MegaMoonShine> Finish it!
<Vordox> COME 'ERE PIRATES! We were 200 years before you became the scourge of the seas. :[
<alexxm> Vordox you put your faith in odin and thor we put ours in cannons and whores
<Vordox> They have sent retreat signals, engaging them before they take a hike, Commander Wrek. Let's bust them before they do!
<Vordox> alexxm: I'm more of Crom then Nordic Mythology
<CrimsonPhoenix> In today's CrimsonPhoenix daily choice, Bad-assery http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m827xufi6l1r8z5dfo1_1280.png
<Vordox> Dat Diana and...
<Vordox> Who is the other one supposed to be?
<Vordox> It's not Leona.
<Vordox> More like Rylai or Ryze.
<Vordox> Or Invoker
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox
<CrimsonPhoenix> how about
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's not a LoL crossover
<CrimsonPhoenix> just both princess being bad-ass
<Vordox> The weapon says otherwise.
<doughnutjoe> REMEMBER ME?
<CrimsonPhoenix> the weapon is a double side
<cachi01|CaveStory> douhgn
<MegaMoonShine> Maybe doughnutjoe :$
<doughnutjoe> im baaaaack
<alexxm> how've been doughnutjoe
<cachi01|CaveStory> doughnutjoe: ywah its you the guy from the party yeah!

<MegaMoonShine> No, it's Starfarer
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I know of megapony
<doughnutjoe> oh..
<doughnutjoe> hmm
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, what?
<CrimsonPhoenix> no it's not
<doughnutjoe> strange i remember there being more people than this...
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the weapon is larger
<CrimsonPhoenix> in Diana's
<doughnutjoe> what are you guys talking about?
<doughnutjoe> :$
<CrimsonPhoenix> I posted a pic and vordox is claiming that it's a LoL crossover
<Vordox> GO BIG MAC!
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I deny that completely
<doughnutjoe> can i see pic?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m827xufi6l1r8z5dfo1_1280.png
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's just pure bad-assery
<doughnutjoe> ^
<doughnutjoe> yeah
<doughnutjoe> artist?
<CrimsonPhoenix> no LoL crossover or anything
<shana> http://atryl.deviantart.com/art/Eclipse-Eternia-318267284
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah
<shana> "atryl" is the artist, claims inspiration came from many fantasy things
<Vordox> Look at dat big Mac <3
<doughnutjoe> nice
<cachi01|CaveStory> lol at atryls avatar
<doughnutjoe> Vordox big mac? were?
<MegaMoonShine> That avatar... O______0
<sagas> whats this?
<Vordox> doughnutjoe: It's the Main Attack Ship name for Wrek's Fleet.
<Thrackerzod> hello everone
<Vordox> It SHREDDED another one
<doughnutjoe> ahh
<alexxm> how've you been Thrackerzod
<MegaMoonShine> hello Thrackerzod :)
<cachi01|CaveStory> hi Thrackerzod!
<doughnutjoe> did Wrek draw anything new?
<CrimsonPhoenix> So does Vordox still say that the pic is a crossover?
<Epicmetalbrony> what is this game called and who is playing right now?
<Thrackerzod> Why am i on this stream everyday, oh wait, its aweosme
<alexxm> of course it is
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Heavy coincidence then
<Chezne> Thrackerzod: Starfarer played by Wrek
<MegaMoonShine> Epicmetalbrony: Starfarer, and wrek is playing right now
<Epicmetalbrony> thx :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> the armor is hardly the same Vordox, you just thought of Diana cause she came out just today
<CrimsonPhoenix> and everything Luna related will make you think of her
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: how old is Atryl's picture?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> ....=.=
<CrimsonPhoenix> just today but that's irrelevent
<Vordox> :P
<Vordox> That's NOT irrelevantthen
<Vordox> >.>
<Vordox> <.<
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's many luna piece that came out
<Vordox> Today with how Diana was recognized 1 week ago?
<Vordox> My coincidence theory just shambled after that fact
<cachi01|CaveStory> BRB im going to buy tacos =D
<doughnutjoe> lol
<doughnutjoe> did you guys see the other pic
<doughnutjoe> of trixie
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox you just don't seem to wish to admit that you're fan-gasming over Diana
<CrimsonPhoenix> which is common with any champion coming out
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Are you 100% denying that Diana was not a part of the inspiration for the art?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I am
<Vordox> I digress
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cause not everything has to be inspired by something that just came out
<doughnutjoe> Song name?
<doughnutjoe> thats playing right now?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :S

<Spectrum_Rush> Oh Sweet Mother of Celestia we're DOOMED... and its gonna be awesome http://derpy.me/f7f0s

<CrimsonPhoenix> In the comments
<CrimsonPhoenix> Many
<MegaMoonShine> About 4 hours doughnutjoe
<CrimsonPhoenix> fantasy
<CrimsonPhoenix> things
<CrimsonPhoenix> nothing precise
<Wrek|Observiking> 05anotehr big figh inc!
*Alpha-Omega-Prime wants to shave head as he is tires of having linger hair
<doughnutjoe> MegaMoonShine 4 hours straight?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> -longer
<doughnutjoe> ._.
<MegaMoonShine> doughnutjoe: Pretty much :$
<CrimsonPhoenix> So just admit that you just thought of Diana after seeing Luna because they're on the same theme which is the Moon
<doughnutjoe> i once played elder scrolls: Oblivion for a whole day
<doughnutjoe> :D
<alexxm> sounds fun doughnutjoe
<doughnutjoe> gave myself a massive headache after though
<doughnutjoe> pretty short game though
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Not if you hunted down evry dungeon in the game
<doughnutjoe> ^
<alexxm> or joined all the guilds
<doughnutjoe> Yeah i was mostly doing guild quests
<Ryunosuke> spaz?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I was pretty much everything in that game. Even became a Daedric prince
<doughnutjoe> really?
<Ryunosuke> i didnt like oblivion
<Vordox> So we don't know CrimsonPhoenix :P
<doughnutjoe> Ryunosuke Why?
<alexxm> doughnutjoe yeah you could do that if you had the shivering isles expansion
<CrimsonPhoenix> Interesting how he hate to be wrong
<Ryunosuke> I dunno,
<Vordox> Wrek: You don't have much of Hull Destroying?
<doughnutjoe> alexxm oh yeah..
<Ryunosuke> i just didnt really like it
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Coincidences doesn't exists to begin with =P
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> The shivering Isles expansion pack. At the end you Become Lord Sheagorath Daedric Prince of madness
<doughnutjoe> yup
<CrimsonPhoenix> What? Then why did you bring coincidence as an argument?
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: That's what you are saying?
<doughnutjoe> and you can get amber armor
<doughnutjoe> :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> No I wasn't
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Then what is your point against mine? O.o
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just said that the pic has absolutely nothing to do with LoL.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> amber was a pain in the plot to get
<Vordox> Yet you can prove it so there is no doubt? =P
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it can't be a coincidence cause there's nothing in there that shows anything from LoL.
<doughnutjoe> Alpha-Omega-Prime not if you cheated ;)
<doughnutjoe> Alpha-Omega-Prime duplication glitch ftw
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :D How could I forget that?
<doughnutjoe> lol

<Jmo4267> But still.
<sonicandmario85> just with diffrent animation
<Kandarihu> Maybe G5 will be more like a Magical Girl anime.
<MegaMoonShine> It might be the CMC
<kirzstryfe> 8,6g5 won't happen for at least 3-5 years after g4 actually ends
<Kandarihu> Whatever Lauran Faust wanted out of G4
<RaveBrony> :o
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kandarihu, like Madoka?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh gosh Madoka and MLP crossover
<sonicandmario85> well if lauran supports us bronies she actually might make G5 be like G4
<CrimsonPhoenix> so much want
<Kandarihu> Well, I'm downloading Pretty Cure right now.

<alexxm> spam
<RaveBrony> o.o
<sonicandmario85> ALL OF THE ROBOTNESS
<RaveBrony> Beep boop son, beep boop
<CrimsonPhoenix> also G5 will be CGI
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's nothing denying that
<Tervicz> Maybe G5 will be created by bronies instead of Hasbro? After all, bronies did create Derpy
<Kandarihu> It would be nice if it could be cel-shaded G5
<Tervicz> Vinyl Scratch, Octavia
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tervicz they haven't
<RaveBrony> Lol, yeah. If they change Anything in the show we dont like Bronies can make episodes themselves :D
<Tervicz> If bronies didn't notice that 'istake' would Derpy have been there?
<sonicandmario85> the name in g5 might be my little pony:friendship forever
<sonicandmario85> or something
<Kandarihu> Tervicz, when G4 goes downhill, we're probably going to start seeing MLP episodes made entirely by bronies.
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Jmo4267> It's 9C, anyone wanna swap weather?
<MegaMoonShine> Tervicz: Definitely not
<CrimsonPhoenix> That's it Tervicz they didn't MAKE it they just point it out
<Kandarihu> It's either going to run for too long or be cancelled too quickly.
<Shooeie> DoubleRainboom are making MLP episodes
<MegaMoonShine> Tervicz: They would've just gone "Oh, just an error"
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/tADT6.png
<CrazyCherry> asdsadasasda
<CrimsonPhoenix> they did name it though
<CrimsonPhoenix> MegaMoonShine, I like how ignorant you are in there
<Jmo4267> <_<
<Tervicz> Derpy wouldn't be what she is without the bronies. The new toys might end up being worth more than the principal of Equestria, no?
<MegaMoonShine> CrimsonPhoenix: What?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/tADT6.png
<CrimsonPhoenix> look at this picture
<CrimsonPhoenix> right there
<Kandarihu> MegaMoonShine, keep in mind that this is on 4Chan. They aren't exactly known for mild reactions.
<CrazyCherry> the chat sure is quiet today...

<MegaMoonShine> Ugh... I screwed up here
<CrimsonPhoenix> Shame Wakfu didn't grew up as much as MLP
<Jmo4267> Still hate it though.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't mind 4chan
<Jmo4267> I just don't have the feelings for sites like that.

<Very_Silly_Filly> I would have like 5 times the epic firepower I do now
<cachi01|MW3> v wat
<Very_Silly_Filly> My ultimate weapon, instead of blowing up the twin towers, it would blow up half the universe
<Bronysith> ARE THERE any good ds emulators out there?

<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: would you kindly link me up? i dont trust myself on google lol
<Very_Silly_Filly> Bronysith: If you want an emulator, always check emulator zone

<Lil_B> Vordox Pony with mustache and Bowsler?
<CapTaIn|MasterBoss> Vordox, this IS a old serie you know?

<Shooeie> Luv them BW colurs
<Vordox> lawl Buytoast XD
<Lil_B> Bowler*
<Buytoast> god dammit
<Buytoast> nothing is sacred to the ponyfags
<Kammerjunk> Which means we wouldn't have that splendid speech.

<Shooeie> That explains thir aim
<RustyMeat> yes they cant aim

<MegaMoonShine> Wow, those guy are stupid
<Braviary> Dem horns.
<Vordox> Buytoast: Well yeah this IS Bronystate :P
<Kammerjunk> Does this mean we have our own pet troll again? :D I was so sad when the last one died.
<Obsidian> He alerted the horde
<Buytoast> doesn't mean i am one
<Thorn3> THIS...IS.. BRONYSTATE!

<twilight_sprinkle> BronyInstrumental: :D
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Say what now
<Pudge> twilight_sprinkle: oh, totally what I was thinking
<Braviary> Well, the majority of us here are in fact fans of MLP, Buytoast.
<CapTaIn|MasterBoss> lol
<Vordox> Buytoast: Well, tough break for you to be here then.
<Vordox> Oh mai
<CapTaIn|MasterBoss> Yay
<CapTaIn|MasterBoss> ~
<Marx> So, Minecraft just reeased a MASSIVE update today.
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: I was sad when our last pet troll died.
<Buytoast> i enjoy rthe show
<Marx> released*
<Buytoast> i hate the fandom
<Kammerjunk> Marx: Yeah, it broke my client.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: Oh?
<Pudge> Buytoast: hell of a lot better than other fandoms
<SirGanjalf> oh nvm, u
<Buytoast> no
<Vordox> XD
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: He was too young to die D:
<Buytoast> no it's not
<Marx> Anyway, what are we watching?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> stormtroopers?
<Pudge> Buytoast: compare this fandom to the sonic fandom, what's better?
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: :D
<Buytoast> nearly every other
<Vordox> XD
<Buytoast> even the sonic fandom is better than this one
<Thorn3> In that case... we will love and tolerate the BUCK out of you, toast.
<Pudge> Not sure if trollin...or is serious
<Spectrum_Rush> why are all of you suprised by them being called StormTroopers? its what they were called irl, the SS
<BronyInstrumental> well, we have a new pet troll!
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: Welcome to Bronystate! You are now our new resident troll! :D
<Vordox> Buytoast: It's not wise talking about that to Bronystate :P
<Kammerjunk> This is so exciting.
<Braviary> Ha ha ha.
<Pudge> yup, trollers gonna troll
<CapTaIn|MasterBoss> Malested or molested XD
<Marx> Also, it's already August? Heck, my birthday is in a couple of weeks.
<alexxm> he was molested
<Vordox> I love that woman
<Vordox> XD
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Buytoast> Man, I wonder how new you guys are.
<Kammerjunk> Marx: I'm surprised to.
<twilight_sprinkle> dats one cool nazi
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: New to what?
*BronyInstrumental snuggles Buytoast
<Kandarihu> If my B-Movie choice ever gets picked, I might have to consider bringing in some acquaintences in from another internet community to prepare for the backlash. Non-bronies, but hopefully not anti-bronies. I can probably count on them to be on their best behaviour.
<Braviary> Gotta go fast, gotta go fast!
<Vordox> Buytoast: We're not THAT new. :P
<Eli> did the movie just start?
<SirGanjalf> Adenoid Hinkle?
<MegaMoonShine> Eli: It's been on for a while
<Pudge> I've been here for 4 weeks
<Pudge> so i'm not THAT new
<Eli> damn.. wanted to see that one for a while
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: wat movie? or is it a surprise?
<CapTaIn|MasterBoss> Buytoast: I think i've been here like a month after this website was made, but i was named pony_(the random number)
<Vordox> Buytoast: But we're mostly cuddley and happily about everything, and sure want to spread dis little insanity onwards, as long as enjoyment of it are in it in it's more geniune form of happiness and friendship
<Vordox> YEP
<Meanwhile> Buytoast: Eh, haters gonna hate. You don't like fandom, stay off the chat and go watch it on youtube.
<BronyInstrumental> i've been here for about a month now
<Buytoast> Oh boy
<Kammerjunk> I'm not new! I've been here all summer!
<Vordox> He can be here Meanwhile
<Pudge> inb4 Buytoast isnt serious
<Buytoast> this is the most attention i've gotten ina while
<killerpony7733> Pudge: I'm a regular like many others :P'
<Buytoast> it's making me feel all important
<Lil_B> It's almost Paradoxic how this Movie was made while the exact same thing was going on in Germany (building "The Warmachine" etc" at the time the mvoe was made) and somehow NOBODY saw the War coming...
<Vordox> Buytoast is cool and all, mostly calm and consitent and thinks things through
<Braviary> HEIL HINKLE
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, I think it would be best to leave it as a surprise until it gets picked.
<Meanwhile> Vordox: It's more likely he's just a troll.
<Pudge> killerpony7733: I'm starting to feel like one
<Vordox> As long as he doesn't cause issues, anyone is allowed her
<SirGanjalf> ded
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: That's kind of sad, though.
<Thorn3> DEAD
<twilight_sprinkle> well damn
<Buytoast> i haven't caused issues in the year i've been coming here
<killerpony7733> Pudge: Trust me when you have been around enough months you start feeling like that fully,
<Buytoast> why would i start them now?
<Vordox> Buytoast: Nope
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: heh kk :P maybe a pokemovie?
<Vordox> Buytoast: That's why I said Meanwhile can be thoughtful of this P
<Lil_B> thats how I play Piano.... only worse
*Alpha-Omega-Prime lurks
<John> hey guys
<Vordox> Anyone here is allowed, as long as they don't cause trouble.
<John> wat do u guys do here
<MegaMoonShine> hey John :)
<Kandarihu> All that I can say is that it's... important.
<John> :)
<Thorn3> For a sec, I thought he was talking to the fruit.
<John> i new
<Obsidian> Hello John
<Braviary> It's great that the Nazi salute, slightly altered, is how a gay person waves hello.
<Kammerjunk> Thorn3: It's a fetish.
<John> hey,
<StinkomanFan> akward
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Well sure, but it seems kinda pointless if you don't like the fandom to hang out with it.
<MegaMoonShine> John: We watch cool stuff and chat
<StinkomanFan> WOOOOOOO
<killerpony7733> John: Read the rules and everything before joining?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :S
<Pudge> well it's time for me to leave for my job interview, wish me luck.
<Kammerjunk> Snort.
<SirGanjalf> Oh my
<RustyMeat> what
<alexxm> oh my
<John> where
<twilight_sprinkle> magik!
<Thorn3> "No, not there!"
<Vordox> ZE MAGICKS
<GilDash> Pudge: Good luck!
<SirGanjalf> That Hinkel is a Spy
<BronyInstrumental> Good Luck, Pudge!
<Lil_B> hi John, We chat and watch ewhatever the Streamers throw at us
<killerpony7733> John: Theres a rules tab above the stream
<Buytoast> i only hate about 90% of the fandom, i can deal with you people because of the entertainment
<Vordox> Buytoast: You by any chance, isn't the one doing "Non brony commentaries"?
<StinkomanFan> :o
<killerpony7733> John: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<Braviary> Huh. He can DEAL with us.
<Thorn3> Don't do it!
<John> ok
<Vordox> That's not 25 FEET
<Braviary> Hey guys, who here likes My Little Dashie?
<Thorn3> NOO
<SirGanjalf> *splat*
<MegaMoonShine> He gonna die
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I do
<Meanwhile> Braviary: Overrated story is overrated.
<SirGanjalf> Herring? lol
<alexxm> fail
<twilight_sprinkle> da tchaplin
<Kammerjunk> Buytoast: I have to say, parts of the fandom, especially the people of 4chan, can be pretty annoying.
<cachi01|MW3> I CAN FLY
<Braviary> Meanwhile, pretend to gawk over it, is what I'm trying to get.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03FUNFACT: We don't take kindly to people who say they want pony episodes...
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: Is 4Chan not just continuously annoying though?
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: Fair point.
<Braviary> After this let's watch a G3.6 pony episode!
<Kammerjunk> Yay!
<Vordox> Buytoast: Are you?
*Meanwhile slaps Braviary with a brick.
<Buytoast> am i what?
<Kandarihu> Well, /g/ is fairly decent, I guess.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Yes please don't request ponies
<cachi01|MW3> oh god no
<killerpony7733> GilDash: Hiya didn't see you get on :D
<Kammerjunk> I agree with Braviary.
<Braviary> Scoot-Scootaloo, G3.5 after this!
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Sly as always. ;)
*cachi01|MW3 prays for braviary's soul
<Meanwhile> Aaaah fml I got clementine juice in my eye
<Vordox> Buytoast: The "Non brony commentary" series on youtube?
<Lil_B> I don't like Fans who try to convert everyone and try to prais the show to heavens >.<
<killerpony7733> GilDash: Or i have just played a bit too much tribes to care :D
<Buytoast> never heard of it
<Vordox> Buytoast: You two would go well together. :P
<Eli> Alpha-Omega-Prime: requesting ponies isn't so bad, just no G1-3 ponies
<Buytoast> does he hate them for liking the show?
<Meanwhile> Tbh, thinking about it Buytoast you're pretty right. The majority of the fandom does suck.
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Well, either and or. XD
<Vordox> Buytoast: You will see, He's not a brony and watching MLP cause of requests from his friends
<Vordox> But he's not changing
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I'm fine with the sea ponies though :3
<Meanwhile> Still, Sonic fandom is easily worse.
<Braviary> If you want to seriously request ponies, you just have to make sure you request G4.
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: That goes without saying, though.
<Chrysalis> incorrect
<Chrysalis> if you want to request ponies
<Chrysalis> Don't
<Jim> Braviary, Doesn't work that way
<Meanwhile> ^
<Kandarihu> Requesting G4 ponies will get us the live show.
<twilight_sprinkle> Braviary: nah, theyll never play g4 if you requesy for it
<Buytoast> it's true meanwhile, but not all of it at least. the 10% that aren't terrible are still good
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: God, no. The live show is the worst thing I have ever seen.
<Kammerjunk> Even G3.6 is better.
<Braviary> Let's watch the live show after this!
<Vordox> Buytoast: Give the non brony commentary a look and see for yourself. :P
<Buytoast> i hate commentaries on things
<Braviary> I hate toast. Except Powdered Toast Man.
<Jim> I hate helicopters.
<TrixieMuffins> omg why havent i found this fic sooner ? .....i think blueblood is going into heromode .... this can only get epic
<Meanwhile> I hate vans
<Buytoast> i don't want to listen to some jackass saying stuff when i'm watching it
<Vordox> Buytoast: Is there SOMETHING you don't hate?
<Braviary> He likes toast.
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: He doesn't hate vests.
<Lil_B> woman let him talk!
<Shooeie> She talks way too much
<Jim> Steam is pretty cool.
<Kandarihu> Asking for Pony music will get us... I don't know. I know of one song that would be like battery acid to a brony's psyche. I don't know if the mods know about it.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> L4D reference
<cachi01|MW3> Kandarihu: which one?
<Braviary> Why not ask for specific songs?
<Lil_B> Kandarihu well get the G1 Applejack song
<Thorn3> So now he's a barber?
<red_ony> what is he going to do.....
<BronyInstrumental> Kandarihu: is it the 'yiff in hell, furfag' song?
<Meanwhile> Who's a silly pony? Who is, you is Lil_B.
<Braviary> I asked for the Children of the Night animatic and I got it.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> he's shaving her beard?
<Vordox> LAWL
<Lil_B> Meanwhile yay XD
<Vordox> Dat beard :D
<Buytoast> hell, this palce is on the precipice i'd say
<Kandarihu> BronyInstrumental, it's less direct than that.
<Meanwhile> The Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness.
<Vordox> Buytoast: Yet you come back :P
<Braviary> You mean the threshhold, right, Buytoast?
<Buytoast> i get to watch movies
<Thorn3> Meanwhile then redness then whiteness
<TrixieMuffins> Brink ?
<cachi01|MW3> Thorn3: dat tobuscus
<Shooeie> She shaving?
<Saturn> 08,01who shaving?
<Eli> wait, we got a non brony here?
<Braviary> You shaving.
<Vordox> Dat foolishness
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: I love that game.
<Lil_B> Saturn Chaplin
<Kandarihu> It's probably more along the lines of G3.6 in terms of maturity, but even worse. And it has no real relation to MLP.
<Meanwhile> Kammerjunk: Gotta love Penny Arcade.
<Braviary> Buytoast, then why do you decide to join the chat?
<Kammerjunk> Eeyup.
<twilight_sprinkle> shiny
<Braviary> NO
<Braviary> I HATE PENNY ARCADE
<Buytoast> hell, if i were to come here to complain about the show, i'd be an even bigger asshole than usual
<Vordox> Braviary: What?
<Saturn> 08,01hey guys
<Vordox> Hai Saturn
<Braviary> Penny Arcade is overrated.
<Kammerjunk> Braviary: orly

<Thorn3> Use the pan!
<Buytoast> now you've gone too far
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: agreed.
<Braviary> I don't like how Penny Arcade is glossed about while Ctrl+Alt+Del only gets you death stares.
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Who are you and what did you do to Saturn.

<Braviary> It's a movie.
<MegaMoonShine> It's a film derpy_pony

<Vordox> Buytoast: Mmm
<twilight_sprinkle> derpy_pony: yes and no, its a joke that its not
<Jim> derpy_pony, It's supposed to be garbish german
<Braviary> Hinkle must have an enormous schwänzstucker.

<Vordox> The Whole Friend In Deed :D
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03FUNFACT: This was Charlie Chaplin's first all talking feature film.
<Eli> have you ever noticed how baldheads... well i'll leave it at that
<Lil_B> this movie reminds me of another Movie "Mein füherer: Die Wahrste wahrheit über Adolf Hitler" (My Leader: The most true Truth about Adolf Hitler) its a Pardoy where a Jew has to train Hitler... it's not a Comedy move, but I love how they changed the Perspective around how people look on everything
<SirGanjalf> inb4 FEGELEIN
<Kandarihu> One of the first talkies, then?
<Eli> Lil_B: you german?
<Lil_B> Eli yes
<Thorn3> Emphasis on the H in 'when'
<Thorn3> Yell at the fruit, guards appear...
<SirGanjalf> Lil_B: So it's kind of mockumentary?
<alexxm> he speaks the truth
<Vordox> You said they did NOT see it come?

<Vordox> Concentration camp was known...

<Buytoast> Adolf Hitler : Wet, Wild and Out-of-Control
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I'm Batman

<Obsidian> Hello makoton
<Thorn3> Hai thar, makoton ^^
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn, do you have Der Untergang
<Lil_B> SirGanjalf no, it's a Comedy movie, but way too dark in my opinion to be a Comdey, and I just like how they portai Hitler as this innoccent person who just want to do something right andf gets used by all the others (Goebbles, Himmler, etc)
<Braviary> There's a long ass in this movie?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Well I'm falling asleep
<alexxm> how you doing makton

<SirGanjalf> Lil_B: To dark to even be called Black Comedy?
<twilight_sprinkle> rar
<Saturn> 08,01<3

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> no I'm not
<Dken2021> SeaponiesofLiverpool you got a mic?
<owloysius> huh
<AttacktheAndalite> Saturn /)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I'm from kentucky
<Saturn> 08,01</gender and consumerism rant>
<owloysius> no idea why, then
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I'd probably use a woman's deodorant, but I don't think I could get away with it before turning 18.
<Kammerjunk> Or at least moving out.
<Kandarihu> Fine, point taken.
<Lil_B> awww, Drawfriedn :3
<Vordox> </adds in money<
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: i agree, some mens deodorants do smell horribly, whereas some womens smells nice. axe is one of the worst
<BronyInstrumental> i don't like girls/guys deoderants, but i smell worse than them so i wear it anyway
*Alpha-Omega-Prime doesn't care because he does what he wants
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> http://theseaponiesofliverpool.bandcamp.com/album/2 they were listening to one of my ponified beatles songs
<SirGanjalf> Yes, yes, very nice-a
<red_ony> Saturn: I didn't suggest you do otherwise..just that there are plenty of smells out there and saying you don't like all men's deodorants sounds pretty generalising..
<Dken2021> I didn't even know smell can be gender specific
<ponyfromPR> brb neeed fooooooood
<Unnr|Unpacking> Saturn: Truth, there is for all purposes no diffrence between men's and women's deodorant same active ingredient, same % in most cases, the big difference is in packaging and marketing. Heck, something like 5% of men admit to buying women's deodorant on surveys.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> ponified Paperback Writer into Derpy Sea Diver
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> who picked this movie?
<Vordox> SeaponiesofLiverpool: You don't sound Hooves to me
<Vordox> :)
<Saturn> 08,01red_ony: i guess; but most tend to be expensive
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr|Unpacking: aye
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> who picked this movie?
<red_ony> Saturn: I use womens shampoos if there is such a thing
<SirGanjalf> Aren't there some unisex deodorants?
<Dken2021> lol
<Kandarihu> SeaponiesofLiverpool, Scoot-Scootaloo is streaming it.
<cachi01|MW3> SeaponiesofLiverpool: Scoot-Scootaloo wanted to stream it :)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Scoot.... marry me
<SirGanjalf> dat Hickey
<Alchemist> Unnr|Unpacking: I'd bet that above 90% of the cost of a perfume is because of PR and marketing. I mean the chemicals and the research needed for them cost almost nothing.
<Unnr|Unpacking> The big diffrence is that antiperspirants geared to women tend to have slightly less aluminum oxide
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Head&Shuolders plus Tresenme
<Braviary> Hallo.
<Kandarihu> He gave us a choice between something Claymation, and something Black and White.
<Lil_B> The Drawfriend hat a Asuras Wrath Big Macintosh Pony XD
<Firelight> O_O
<Braviary> I was gone for a few minutes, when I come back Mario is there?
<cachi01|MW3> claymation = wallace and gromit right?
<Unnr|Unpacking> on average, but that means like .1-.5%
<Dken2021> mmmmm, head and shoulders, too bad I can't afford any
<Kammerjunk> Braviary: Pretty much, yeah.
<Dken2021> cachi01|MW3 right you are
<SirGanjalf> cachi01|MW3: ^
<cachi01|MW3> yay
<cachi01|MW3> Dken2021: speaking like yoda why are you?
<Kandarihu> So far, the only claymation Scoot-Scootaloo has streamed is Gumby and some serious creepypasta.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> dear Scootaloo, please marry me?
<cachi01|MW3> I MISSED A CREEPYPASTA?
<Dken2021> didn't realize right you are was yoda speak
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> the tresenme is b1 vitamins for wavy or curly hair
<cachi01|MW3> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
<makoton> Oooh, creepypasta

<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: really? what happened?
<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: strange it looked familar.. eh whatever i checked it so... all i can say is the internet is a fun place
<Chrysalis> its been internal server error 500
<Chrysalis> cant even serv htm files
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: that probably means you have a bad .htaccess or something
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: afaik, you can ssh in and look at logs
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> weird I closed my eyes for a lil and I felt like someone was lurking beside me o.0
<Saturn> 08,01wait, i might be thinking of a different hosting company...
<Saturn> 08,01but contact their support; they're generally quite good
<SirGanjalf> not bad
<Chrysalis> the htaccess i ripped from my old site, its fine
<Saturn> 08,01and as far as i've seen, Gandi's setup is rock solid
<Firelight> Going back to High School Next Week... -.-
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> fuuuuuu
<Kandarihu> How long is this movie?
<BronyInstrumental> Firelight: sucks, man. i still have 4 weeks left

<Kammerjunk> I still have two weeks until I start HTX.
<Firelight> Out.
<Kammerjunk> I can barely wait.
<Dken2021> oot?
<Kammerjunk> It'll be so fun.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I don't even know when high school starts here and I still haven't got signed up because my mom lost her I.D and all of our social security numbers

<Michael> cachi01|MW3: wut
<Dken2021> Alpha-Omega-Prime you don't know your ssn?
<Chrysalis> well, the htm is working
<Firelight> The internet is for Porn. The INternet IS for Porn. All the Guys unzip their Flys For Porn, Porn, Porn.
<cachi01|MW3> POORN is what the great mighty poo looks at Michael
<Chrysalis> now i need to jury rig my old system onto the new SQL layout

<Chrysalis> yeah
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> No my mom didn't give it to me because she didn't trust me with it. Now someone else probably stole my Identity
<Michael> cachi01|MW3: great mighty poo, POORN? i dunno what are you talking about :(
<Chrysalis> its also really annoying theres no ftp access
<Unnr|Unpacking> Chrysalis: if it isn't being held together at the seams by a poorly written bash script, it isn't a proper jury-rig
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: seriously? how do you transfer files?
<Dken2021> watch out, he can throw an ocean

<Lil_B> hi Dken2021

<Kandarihu> We're at least an hour into it iirc.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I'd say about 1/2way
<Alchemist> Kandarihu: Im AB+ too. But since Hungary has the highest percentage of AB+ population, the AB+ storage quote fills up pretty quick.
<cachi01|MW3> 125 minutes is like........
<Braviary> What about him? I was asking who Chris is.
<cachi01|MW3> 125 MINUTES!

<Kandarihu> As soon as I lost mom's laptop, I've been on here downloading Pretty Cure to my old computer's hard drive. I actually want it on my external hard drive. Now I'm moving it all over, and it's taking over an hour to do that.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> i wish this had actually happend
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, are you mods having a competition for most anti-spam kicks? The counters are suspicious.
<Lil_B> well, Brezel=German XD
<Kammerjunk> I keep imagining you have a scoreboard somewhere.
<StinkomanFan> That awkward moment when a jew and Hitler look the exact same
<owloysius> Kammerjunk: some of them have counters
<SirGanjalf> toot toot toot toot
<Kammerjunk> owloysius: Dari doesn't, but he's a silly filly.

<SirGanjalf> Speech! Speech!
<Kammerjunk> Why do I know most of this speech by heart.
<alexxm> speech
<Michael> epic speech inb4
<StinkomanFan> This is that dude PRETENDING to be Hinkle right?
<sonicandmario85> too bad the human race never evolved more
<Kammerjunk> Or rather, how.
<Spectrum_Rush> TACTICAL SPEACH INCOMING!!! LISTENING TO IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
<Dken2021> this THE moment?
<Kammerjunk> StinkomanFan: By accident, yes.
<sonicandmario85> maybe it will evolve in a billion years XD
<Kandarihu> Ah, I see how this speech works into the movie. Quite the twist.
<Braviary> HERE IT COMES
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Braviary> THE PART YOU'VE ALL HEARD A HUNDRED TIMES BUT NEVER GETS OLD
<Michael> LMAO
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> not the first guy speech though, that guy needs to be shot
<Kammerjunk> Braviary: Especially because it's still mostly valid today.
<Lil_B> ok, this and and the movie I talked about erlier really haver a lot in common, especially the speach :/
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :S
<Spectrum_Rush> The Phooey

<MegaMoonShine> Nooooow!!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> :'( music is so awesome
<alexxm> best speech ever
<Lil_B> my heart is beating so fast right now <3
<Michael> silence, speech inb4
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, it's scary how much of this speech fits today.
<Kandarihu> I'm turning up my speakers for this.
<Kammerjunk> ^
<MegaMoonShine> ^^
<Spectrum_Rush> ^^^
<CCCP> ^
<Lil_B> ^^^^
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Kammerjunk> wat
<StinkomanFan> An aesop that will stand the test of time
<Stormfox> it's sad really how many people disliked this film back then when it first came out in his time.
<Braviary> Can we watch the TF2 version when the movie ends?
<Dark92Enigma> What were you watching?.......i'm back
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> hy was charlie not elected president after this?
<Kammerjunk> Braviary: That one is really well made.
<StinkomanFan> SeaponiesofLiverpool, he wasn't running
<Michael> Dark92Enigma: hai, the great dictator
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> write-in candidate
<CCCP> SeaponiesofLiverpool well. hes a good speaker but did he write this speach?
<alexxm> how've you been Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> Michael what's it about?
<MegaMoonShine> Hai Dark92Enigma :)
<CCCP> hi Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm fine, as always, but i feel a cramp in my right arm
<Michael> Dark92Enigma: it's a movie from Charles chaplin, a parody from hitler, i think
<Braviary> Yeah!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> He wrote produced and directed this movie
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma i heard booker t's smackdowns general manager now
<Stormfox> this is the type of speech we need today
<Michael> ^
<killerpony7733> ^^
<Dark92Enigma> Michael not the one with ''Mah Fuhrer! I'm WALKING!?
<alexxm> ^^^^
<MegaMoonShine> ^^^^^
<Michael> Dark92Enigma: i dunno
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm SO i heard
<Michael> my ideals in a nutshell
<alexxm> Dark92Enigma do you think he'll be good at it
<StinkomanFan> MEDIC IS HERO
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> why can we never elect a good leader.... we know what the perfect leader is through movies like this
*Spectrum_Rush Applauses
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm Better than AJ as GM of course
<cachi01|MW3> HATE AND INTOLERANCE?
<Kammerjunk> I hope I'm not the only one who spoke along there.
*SirGanjalf cheers
<Unnr|Unpacking> bai everypony, time to go unpack books!~
<Braviary> Do away with hate and intolerance!
<cachi01|MW3> HATE AND INTOLERANCE = ANTIBRONIES
<CCCP> bye Unnr|Unpacking
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> why can we never elect a good leader.... we know what the perfect leader is through movies like this
<Kammerjunk> cachi01|MW3: Basically, Chaplin would've made a great brony.
<owloysius> bye UncouthLurker
<MegaMoonShine> Bai Unnr|Unpacking :)
<owloysius> bye Unnr|Unpacking
<Michael> i mean the speech
<cachi01|MW3> bye Unnr|Unpacking!
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, I'm not the only one who spoke along, right?
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, Unnr|Unpacking!
<Unnr|Unpacking> Kammerjunk: nope
<MegaMoonShine> That was beautiful... :'(
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<alexxm> bye Unnr|Unpacking
<Dark92Enigma> Suddenly, this looks like Wizard of Oz
<Unnr|Unpacking> :3 it actually delayed me leaving
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> :'(
<Unnr|Unpacking> >_>
<Kandarihu> cachi01|MW3, we bronies are just as capable of evil as the anti-bronies are as well. We musn't be prideful.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk: I'm more of a listener to this speech
<Michael> bye Unnr|Unpacking
<cachi01|MW3> Kandarihu: i know but im surprised when he said hate and intolerance cause actually thats the opposite of ouor motto
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: It is inspirational.
<Braviary> He said look up!
<cachi01|MW3> love and tolerate
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> look up! its RainbowDash
<cachi01|MW3> our
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Sonic Rainboom
<Braviary> Would Rainbow Dash work in a grayscale world?
<Kammerjunk> Tolerance I can accept, but I don't feel like I have to love every bloke.
<alexxm> she'd sonic rainboom it
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> like what happened to Pinkie
*twilight_sprinkle violins
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> :;(
<MegaMoonShine> :'(
<Spectrum_Rush> Braviary: think of Daring Do's Mane
<Lil_B> 11/10
*SirGanjalf claps
<MegaMoonShine> Amazing speech/10
*Michael applauds
<Braviary> Encore!
<Kammerjunk> I wonder what'd happen if Dashie did a Sonic Rainboom while Discorded.
*Dark92Enigma Now how, she would get sad again.............ooooooooh. When she saw that Rainboom there
<Obsidian> Awesome movie
<Kammerjunk> I rate this moustache/10.
<Michael> medic!!
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Not bad as I was only awake to finish the movie
<StinkomanFan> MEDIC IS HERO
<Kandarihu> I've been thinking of what it means to hate and what it means to fight. I maybe wrongheaded in this, but in my humble opinion, fighting does not neccessarily entail a hatred of one's enemy.
<Dark92Enigma> SPEECH/10
<Obsidian> TF2 version
<Stormfox> lol MEDIC XD
<Kammerjunk> This one is very well made.
<MegaMoonShine> TF2 makes everything cooler
<Lil_B> makes me question... when did this movie come to germany?
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Goodness, no. They're not mutually inclusive.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> this is horrible.... TF2 doesn't fit
<StinkomanFan> I find the TF2 version more touching. The music and the imagery
<Obsidian> It's not that bad
<Michael> epic
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> going to bed now
<SirGanjalf> the music adds a nice touch tough
<SirGanjalf> *though
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> movie version is 20% better
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu I'm all for fighting for one wants, and than doesn't involve hatred
<Kammerjunk> And to think this is from the guy who does stuff like Skype Molments.
<Michael> Gnight Alpha-Omega-Prime sleep well
<StinkomanFan> We can argue but it won't matter. The message remains the same
*Dark92Enigma <----- And add French Fries with that order
<Kandarihu> Violence, war, WMDs, all of these are last resorts at one stage of another.
<Meanwhile> You are not kettle.
<Alchemist> Unless its a preemptove strike :D
<StinkomanFan> Did the movie show what happened to Hinkle?
<alexxm> StinkomanFan i think he died
<StinkomanFan> alexxm, I hope so
<Dark92Enigma> WHAT ABOUT BOOMER!?
<Kammerjunk> For some reason, this speech puts an idea of a Equestria where the Changelings had invaded, and Chrysalis did this speech.
<Kandarihu> Being willing to fight, even kill if one has no choice, doesn't entail a love of war or all of the vices that make war a reality.
<Kammerjunk> My mind is strange.

<Lil_B> CCCP wow... I only ever heard this on Parodius XD
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: Funny you should say that because I've never really heard of her.
<Spitfireisbestpony> Trollstia
<CrimsonPhoenix> THERE ARE WAY MORE PEOPLE THAT CAN VOICEACT IN THIS COMMUNITY

<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: http://i.imgur.com/d9qVS.gif i cant wait for when it starts
<CCCP> Lil_B wow
<cachi01> Spitfireisbestpony: everypony has seen the pony.movs
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, she's in .mov she's in Fighting is Magic as Mayor Mare she's in My little Portal
<Kawaii_icybeauti> cachi01: Don't say that in here. You'll wake up the mods...

<CCCP> Lil_B i want that game
<CrimsonPhoenix> worst of all

<CCCP> .MOVS are meh..
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Shed is best mov. After that, it's either party or magic
<Lil_B> CCCP its weird as hell, but fun
<CrimsonPhoenix> all of her voice are similar
<Spectrum_Rush> i'll agree with Crim on that

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dat directive four.
<DocSane> All his directives were wiped in the last movie, right?
<Sumica> 00,10noob tube
<RustyMeat> I tought they removed that
<otakon> He can't
<XylemTube> dat noob tube
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I thought he deleted them all?
<owloysius> that is indirect
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Kind of disapointed there was no Hellfire remix at all in that world
<CriticKitten> He did.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In Robocop 2.
<ShiningArmor> aww they died D:
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: Primes were on backup
<CriticKitten> He deleted his directives at the end of the second movie. >_>
<RustyMeat> PLOT HOLE
<Spectrum_Rush> dat spas12
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: the primes stay, basis of system and all that.
<Kandarihu> Yeah, I don't think the makers of this movie are aware of that.
<CriticKitten> This movie's already operating on a false premise.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> how did he take a grenade to the chest and still function?
<Obsidian> poppin smoke
<otakon> CriticKitten: he deleted those bullshit ones
<ponyfromPR> this movie is amazeing
<Distortion> You know, why does Robocop get his ass handed to him in the first act.
<cachi01> PaladinDrakkenwolf: cause he is batman
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, that's an understatement
<CriticKitten> otakon: No, he deleted *all* of them.
<StinkomanFan> If RoboCop shot them then and there it would've ended to fast Nittany_Discord
<otakon> CriticKitten: no he rebooted
<cachi01> PaladinDrakkenwolf: i mean robocop
<Vivix> well if robocop shot them imagine the fallout
<otakon> CriticKitten: primes were in local backup
<CriticKitten> otakon: The movie indicates that he deleted every directive from his memory.
<Vivix> police vs second police?
<CriticKitten> otakon: Including the primary ones.
<noname> ....
<otakon> CriticKitten: they reinstalled them then
<ShiningArmor> am i the only one seing ponies on the screen ._>
<otakon> the prime's I mean
<Fou_Lou> they must have reinstalled the directives
<Sumica> 00,10they probably put them back in when they gave him upgrades
<CriticKitten> otakon: Or maybe the writers of this movie are making shit up.
<otakon> you dumbass why did you NOT wear your vest?
<CriticKitten> Both are equally likely. >_>
<Kandarihu> His electrocuting himself wiped out all of his directives.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Should have chosen your words carefully girl.
<Distortion> Now sacrifice the blood of a virgin to bring her bck to life.
<Lil_B> and I'm back

<BronyInstrumental> i've managed to miss every star wars screening on every night :D
<Vivix> actual cider, mind you
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also I never played TWEWY so I had NO IDEA who most of the characters were
