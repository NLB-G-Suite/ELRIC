<RaveBrony> Yeah :P
<ofna01> TRANCES
*Jim wubs
<LordCelestia> 0,5Another thing
<Ragnalock> some people are so annoying "you like some other taste of (insert anything here) so you suck)
*Globetrotter is entranced by the song
<LordCelestia> 0,5Why do bronies say "Love and Tolverance"?
*Globetrotter lolol
<LordCelestia> 0,5Im a brony and I find that annoying
<Globetrotter> Who knows.
<CountDoofus> nick: please refrain from posting video links during a stream, it's considered rather rude
<Kammerjunk> I'm annoying and I find that a brony.
<Marx> Isn't there a chatroom for talking about technical difficulties?
<LordCelestia> 0,5If someone pisses me off Im not gonna "love" or "tolerate" them
<Globetrotter> LC because that is what the show is about?
<nick> It was supposed to just be a reaction.
<Tovler> Love and tolerance is just a passive aggressive response, sadly.
<nick> ^
<LordCelestia> 0,5Meh
<LordCelestia> 0,5I find it annoying
<Wrek> 05does it look portalish?
<Globetrotter> Love them with your fist
<LordCelestia> 0,5If it gets overused
<the4th|Acecombat> If you must post these links during stream, please PM them.
<nick> Yeah
<Jim> eeyup
<nick> It totally does wrek
<YourLittleDashie> I'm back
<Globetrotter> My pony has 'stache
<Ragnalock> LordCelestia the love and tolerance thing means "i'm going to f(yay~)k you up
<RaveBrony> Ah!! Now i see what youre drawing!
<nick> WHEATLEY PONY IS BEST PONY
<YourLittleDashie> Dashie is best pony
<Sundaysmile> Or it just means a really crushing hug
<RaveBrony> Pshh
<nick> FATALITY: Loved and tolerated.
<RaveBrony> ^
<Ragnalock> YourLittleDashie: your name makes me cry
<Sundaysmile> btw will there be a pony stream tomorrow?
<Jim> http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltj81imaDj1r4lccgo1_500.jpg
<Sundaysmile> I know there is no new ep
<YourLittleDashie> Ragnalock: D'aww *hugs you*
<nick> Wheatley pony is also amputee pony apparently
<Globetrotter> Jim lol
<nick> :P
<the4th|Acecombat> To me, "love and tolerate" is a neutral stance to avoiding conflict with pony haters or similar disagreements with Bronyism in general.
<ofna01> derp
<ofna01> why is my chat lagging so hard
<YourLittleDashie> Real bosses can have this video open in 15 tabs at once: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRGbrs83wRA
*Jim shrugpony
<rallebauz> What tool are you using for SAI to do those nice sketch lines?
<Globetrotter> Am I the only one who pronounces it garla
<Globetrotter> not galla
<nick> I'm trying that dashie
<Ragnalock> for me it's gaala
<the4th|Acecombat> gA-luh
<Globetrotter> gARler
<Sundaysmile> dat chassis?
<YourLittleDashie> I always thought "Love and Tolerate" meant that you accepet the hater's views and arguments and basically ignore them
<Globetrotter> Because I are britesh!
<YourLittleDashie> brb
<nick> OH GOD DASHIE, WHY WOULD YOU DO
<Snuffsis> Whatever you guys do, do not check out the scandinavian versions of My Little Pony. I did, and i cried.
<Sundaysmile> cried in shame? cried with joy?
<Globetrotter> ?
<Dark_Horst> personality pony?
<Snuffsis> Cried in shame, my eyes and ears bled
<nick> Wheatley pony!
<Sundaysmile> I'm tempted to view
<ofna01> chat is fixed nao
<Snuffsis> You have been warned. :)
<Jim> Why would your eyes bleed? Aren't they the same ponies?
*flutter_spin comes in hearing the best song in the world.
<Dark_Horst> i once took a look qat the german version. it made me feel shame
<nick> FLUTTERSHY IS ALWAYS ANGRY IN GERMAN
<Snuffsis> Well, i cried blood then! Either way, it was horrible.
<flutter_spin> wrek drawing I assume?
<Jim> TBH, they aren't that bad. Although the original voice actors are better
<nick> This is just subtle enough to be nightmare fuel, i regret asking of this
<Dark_Horst> don't know about fluttershy, i couldn't bear more than 2 minutes into one episode
<flutter_spin> I thought you were going to draw fluttershy with glasses and a hat?
<Sundaysmile> I wonder if there is an arabic one?
<Dark_Horst> then my self preservation instincts made me close the window
<flutter_spin> They have a video of all the ponies in different languages on youtube.
<Stallion_of_War> Is... is that a Wheatly pony?
<ofna01> equestria girls remix?
<Sundaysmile> yes

<CCCP> to be honest i dont hate Justin Beiber. I mean i dont really like any of his music but the fact that so many people hate him is just wrong. Many people would actually kill him and i feal really bad for him. I mean they dont judge him of his personality they judge him off his mediocre bland musicand thats not fair.

<Coolbluemidnite> Anyone remember the bugs life movie? :3

<drbrony> vaugely
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I liked it.
<DeathStar> up*
<Coolbluemidnite> up is a good movie
<DeathStar> yes it is
<Kammerjunk> I prefer Tangled.
<CrimsonFoxx> My favorite Pixar movie is Wall-E
<otakon> RAWRity: that new trailer looks GOOD
<Kammerjunk> I really love the animation in Tangled.
<drbrony> the beginning is so depressing in up
<Bronyzilla> Wall-e FTW.
<Coolbluemidnite> Wall-e makes my friend cry
<otakon> CrimsonFoxx: same here, but I really like UP too
<DeathStar> i like monsters inc
<Coolbluemidnite> MONSTERS INC <£

<CrimsonFoxx> Yeah, Up is awesome
<Coolbluemidnite> <3 I mean
<ThatsAShinySky> Brave is aljsdas
<otakon> Toy Story 3, who like that?
<Kammerjunk> Dat <£
<RAWRity> otakon: if nothing else, it's pretty much guaranteed to be better than the LAST Pixar movie.
<Kammerjunk> otakon: It was alright.
<Coolbluemidnite> I like toy story 1 and 2 havent seen 3
<otakon> RAWRity: you mean Cars 2?
<RAWRity> otakon: we don't refer to it by name.
<drbrony> It's epic.
<otakon> Kammerjunk: it was alright? really? it was probably the most emotionally charged one of the series
<Kammerjunk> The-film-that-shall-not-be-named
<CrimsonFoxx> Toy Story 3 is awesome
*DeathStar sudders at thought of cars 2
<Kammerjunk> Probably. I don't know.
<DeathStar> yes it is
<Kammerjunk> I fell asleep.
<RAWRity> DeathStar: we do not speak its name!
<DeathStar> sorry :(
<otakon> Kammerjunk: nah, Cars 2 isn't HORRIBLE it's not the coming of the Anti-Christ it's just not up to Pixar's snuff
<Kammerjunk> But that's because I hadn't gotten any sleep, not because it was boring.
<otakon> also, Tangled was really enjoyable
<RAWRity> otakon: no, it's pretty crap.
<otakon> not FANTASTIC or nothing but fun
<Coolbluemidnite> i dont like cars i almost fell asleap to it o.ol
<Kammerjunk> I really like what animation has become, as shown in Tangled. I haven't gotten around to seeing that new animation film.
<drbrony> Anyone seen puss in boots?
<otakon> I haven't seen Cars 2 so I can't really from a opinion tbh
<Coolbluemidnite> i wanna see that so bad
<Tovler> I need to pirate Cars 2.
<Kammerjunk> I don't remember the name of it. Something to do with a ship.
<Coolbluemidnite> MUPPETS <3
<Kammerjunk> Tintin, maybe?
<Golakka> so i got bored today, played some wow
<Kammerjunk> I don't know.
<Snuffsis> Gais, is it possible to get those pony smilies in the irc client? :O
<Golakka> Woke up lvl 70, logged off 85 :p
<DeathStar> MUPPTS!
<Tovler> I keep that forgetting Puss In Boots came out
<Coolbluemidnite> I wanna see muppets movie <3
<otakon> Kammerjunk: The animation is like a classic Disney animated movie in 3 dimensions, it really is
<CrimsonFoxx> Puss in Boots was pretty good, though not really as good as the Shrek movies
<Coolbluemidnite> miss piggie is best muppet
<drbrony> It was really good.
<otakon> ^^
<Jim> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZuqcYVF_Wo&feature=channel_video_title

<CrimsonFoxx> I loved the Muppets
<otakon> I REALLY want to see The Muppets too
<Kammerjunk> or without*
<Golakka> Without
*RAWRity didn't like tangled very much.
<Kammerjunk> Neat.

<Shizuka> 13DHCP doesn't have anywhere close to that fast of a turnaround on DSL or cable
<Kammerjunk> dr-whooves: 2 PM GMT.
<Tovler> I couldn't have been the same guy. He named himself GUILDA
<Jim> It was just me quoting Patrick
<prince-dari> klaxa: Nah, we weren't banning him because he's fun
<Coolbluemidnite> Baaaaack
<pikorar> Hello people, just passing through on my stroll through the internet.
<Derpy_Hooves> MIRC has a proxy feature
<Kammerjunk> But 3 PM in Denmark.
<dr-whooves> have fun
<prince-dari> He could have become our pet troll.
<klaxa> if you'd ban them they wouldn't be able to simply rejoin

<Coolbluemidnite> -SQUEE-
<dr-whooves> bye guys be back soon
<Kammerjunk> Will do.
<DeathStar> pikorar: hello

<otakon> come back soon!
<pikorar> Bye.

<Kammerjunk> otakon: Yes, and "organised" "attack".
<Kammerjunk> an*
<Coolbluemidnite> And what a successful attack it was -sarcasm-

<pony_946416> CHAN SHALL INVADE
<DeathStar> yay
<Coolbluemidnite> LAUNCHED ATTACK MUCH?
<Tovler> Organized attacked. I don't know what to say about that.
<pony_946416> 4CHAN SHALL INVADE
<prince-dari> I knew my pet would come back to me.
<CrimsonFoxx> Yay, more fun with the troll!
<otakon> hello again pony_946416
<pony_946416> STUPUID BRONY FAGS
<ThatsAShinySky> OH MY GOD. I WENT ON MW3 PC, FIRST GAME, A HACKER, SECOND GAME, HACKER
<Shizuka> 134chan is not your personal army
<Sumica> 00,10yay such a good pet
*otakon hugs pony_946416
*Jim rolls over...this again?
<pony_946416> 4CHAN SHALL INVADE
<Sumica> 00,10he knows his way home.
<Coolbluemidnite> Brb sorting eyes
<prince-dari> Aww
<otakon> oh why?
<ThatsAShinySky> d'aww
<prince-dari> Why he type so fast.
<DeathStar> pony_946416: will you have my babbies
<otakon> bc he can
<Shizuka> 13because he's six and has nothing better to do
<TheNuclearPeaceKeepe> Why would 4chan attack anyway?
<ThatsAShinySky> yeah
<klaxa> there we go
<prince-dari> klaxa, you don't have to ban him.
<otakon> indeed, I don't even go to 4chan
<TheNuclearPeaceKeepe> What did we ever do to 4chan?
<otakon> klaxa: hello sir, fine job you are doing keeping the peace
<klaxa> well i was asked to take care of it by Derpy_Hooves, so... i mean seriously
<Tovler> Attacking us will make his dad proud.
<prince-dari> If we want to ban him, we'll ban him
<CrimsonFoxx> Pony_946416, don't you know that 4chan is where this fandom started? They can't help you there
<Kammerjunk> It will also give him a bigger e-peen.
<Shizuka> 13fwiw he does keep coming back with different IPs
<Shizuka> 13so unless we want to nuke his ISP..
<otakon> Shizuka: any idea how?
<Swaffy> Holy crap. This thing hates Google Chrome.
<Bronyzilla> Hi, what's going on?
<prince-dari> We're taming our pet troll.
<Shizuka> 13a) proxy, b) dialup, or c) ridiculously low DHCP turnaround time
<Bronyzilla> Ah.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3school's out for the day, so the trolls come to play
<Everlasting_Joy> Ooooooh! A troll? Why was I not informed of this?!
<prince-dari> He'll probably be back in a minute.
<Jim> Our pet troll seems kind of untrained though
<Bronyzilla> This should be fun.
<Sumica> 00,10iinet is't that a cell company?
<prince-dari> That's why we're taming him
<Shizuka> 13and i doubt C cause the client doesn't decide "i don't want this address anymore", the server says "you don't get this address anymore"
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Jim by the way.
<Jim> ohai there Everlasting_Joy
<Kammerjunk> AND HE SAID, "Rage the best rage in the world, or I'll troll your site."
<Shizuka> 13so either a or b
<TheNuclearPeaceKeepe> rage is best rage? as opposed to what?
<ThatsAShinySky> b
<ThatsAShinySky> im saying b
<ThatsAShinySky> it takes a little bit to change proxy
<ThatsAShinySky> dialup?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3people still use dialup?
<Jim> Me and Kyle, we looked at eachother. And we each said! OK
<ThatsAShinySky> yeah
<Kammerjunk> TheNuclearPeaceKeepe: No idea, I'm just spouting whatever's on my mind.
<Shizuka> 13i'll get a version next time he oozes in here
<ThatsAShinySky> Kirzstryfe, i know someone who does
<Kammerjunk> Speak today, think tomorrow. That's me.
<klaxa> so i hope this is being dealt with, if he comes back just ban his hostmask
<ThatsAShinySky> hes our pet ;(
<Tovler> We need to learn so interrogation/diplomacy skills here.
<Jim> And we raged the first thing that came to our minds, just so happen to be, the best rage in the world, it was the best rage in the woooorld.
<Shizuka> 13we've tried that though, if he comes back with different ips then our only option is to wildcard down to the ISP level
<ThatsAShinySky> exactly, we troll them, we learn lessons, we send letters to celestia.
*Jim stops singing
<prince-dari> Why isn't he back yet? :<
<ThatsAShinySky> :<
<Kammerjunk> Jim: Needless to say, the troll was stunned.
<Everlasting_Joy> Mebe he's rallying the troops prince-dari.
<DeathStar> Jim: aww y u stop
<Coolbluemidnite> Back has the parasprite died yet?
<ThatsAShinySky> FUHCHE-AN WILLEHZ INVADOS!
<Jim> **I move away from the mic to breathe*
<Sumica> 00,10just put some kibble out Dari he will come back when he gets hungry.
<ThatsAShinySky> onmonmonm
<prince-dari> :D
<Tovler> I'm pretty sure professional interrogators don't go arround calling their prisoners "Terrorists". We need to be mature about this.
<Coolbluemidnite> -puts bacon out-
<Coolbluemidnite> they'll come back soon
<Stirred_Brew> we need to be smart
<otakon> we are being mature, brb
<Stirred_Brew> not take the bait he gives
<TheNuclearPeaceKeepe> Even though he's a master at bating....
<Everlasting_Joy> Ugh
<Stirred_Brew> me too

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and you must wear that armor in your bookfort
<DeathStar> I'm BACK!
<Coolbluemidnite> wb
<Yellowquiet> lol
*Shizuka 13giggles
<CriticKitten> Just because it can't stop a high-powered round from a MAGNUM (which is supposed to be a high-penetrating round) doesn't mean it doesn't work >_>
<shoopderp> :D
<MyLittleVisuals> lawl xD
<Shizuka> 13poor jamie
<pony_7110> I saw a R34 picture of Zoey making out with the witch. CANNOT UNSEE!
<Sumica> 00,10any thing is bullet proof if you have enough of it between you and the bullet.
<RaveBrony> Whats a good game to get to play with alot of people (on steam)

<Sumica> 00,10drag
<Lucid> Actually, it would be a little bit of both
<RaveBrony> I want to play something with the bronies in here :o but i have no games (except TF@)
<RaveBrony> *TF2
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> alien sawrm is free~
<LadyCanary> ...Wowie!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> swarm*
<Lawrence> TF2 has all kinds of brony stuff
<CriticKitten> Over seven miles, it'd have dropped off significantly and slowed a great deal, allowing air resistance to drag it down faster. But the air isn't "bulletproof", it's just slowing the bullet down.
<Lucid> No, no it isn't
<Coolbluemidnite> baaack
<LadyCanary> Feeling lucky?
<CriticKitten> "Bulletproof" implies that it's actually stopping the round dead.
<LadyCanary> Well, do ya?
<Dark_Horst> alrighty then, now try a 600 nitro express
<pony_7110> You know those big lewbowski guys? The ones that apperared in MLP? here, rule 63. http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/131/878/tumblr_lej0uqGoND1qdf611o1_1280.png

<YourLittleDashie> Quote from My Little Dashie:
<YourLittleDashie> I think she understands me, for after I say those words her eyes return to their normal size, and she snuggles herself more comfortably inside my jacket. She squirms a little, trying to get into a more comfortable position. I can feel her hooves and wings poking me as she shifts. Then, to top it off, she rests her chin onto my arm and lets out a deep sigh, closing her eyes to drift off to sleep.

<Brony4Life> yay :[
*Midnight_Tempest|STO bursts into flames
*RaveBrony dies from the diabeetus and explodes from awesomeness
<Snakeeeeees> bunny I think
<Meanwhile> The diabetus is beyond comprehendable levels.
<Classic> PONIES
<CountDoofus> If 1 Fluttershy can cause diabeetus, imagine what 10 million of them will do to you
<ScootaChicken> Diabetes runs in my family...
<SuperBrony64> OhioBronyShow: Because the professor seeks to sabotage BMN for me and decides to have class during BMN.
<Snakeeeeees> quick somepony get me my insulin
<ScootaChicken> so far I've avoided it
<fluttershyfan158> in my opinion fluttershy is best pony..we have our own opinions
<kingqball> ...i wish i could get high enough to see fluttershy's...

<YourLittleDashie> 1000000 Fluttershys = 1000000 heart explosions
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Meanwhile> 10 million Fluttershy's would cause you literally turn to sugar.
<Dark_Horst> i try to picture this song... so... glorious
<Kammerjunk> You're listening to that song.
<GentleHeaven> im the kind of person who would rename the original, then put this under the original name, then give it to owl city fans
<Classic> ITS OVER 900000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

<kingqball> fluttershyfan158 same with me...unless you count background, then she is tide with vinyl
<OhioBronyShow> Well, at least you're a rebel, and remain watching ponies at school. But my school's computer system blocked Youtube...

<GentleHeaven> i need to come here more ofen, my music collection becomes more awesome
<Meanwhile> OTP.
*IshBestPony haz not seen Serenity or Firefly
<F1uttershy> sleeping is the gateway to equestria
<fluttershyfan158> shes so cute i daaaw everytime i see her
<Dashie_Dashie> SaturnPie, me when I hear this song. http://i.imgur.com/zKuva.jpg
<Kammerjunk> Quantum science is the gateway to Equestria.
<StinkomanFan> And then Spike met his new father
<RaveBrony> Lol, Dashie_Dashie :D
<September> Ok srsly how long is this? lol
<Kammerjunk> That's why I keep telling you ponies to become quantum scientists.
<Lucid> I actually had a dream about ponies last night. I distinctly remember Lyra and Bon Bon
<StinkomanFan> And was terrified
<September> Lucid Do tell more.
<IshBestPony> Is it necessary to watch Firefly to understand whats going on in Serenity
<Paradise92> this song is just awesome
<Meanwhile> Search your feelings Spike, you know it to be true.
<Pale_Horse> Somewhere in the mutiverse... in parallel dimentions... we are already all ponies...
<CrazyBronyDonut> love pony dreams
<Buytoast> If people actually went to Equestria, wouldn't they bring thousands of deadly bacteria that could potentially kill thousands of ponies?
<unfoundbug> IshBestPony not necessary
<GentleHeaven> firefly @_@ need to watch
<RaveBrony> Oh god...the diabeetus, its too much.....
<fluttershyfan158> what would you do if you saw fluttershy in real life
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!
<September> OHBOI.
<RaveBrony> O.o
<unfoundbug> but there are alot of references within the show
<OhioBronyShow> YUS
<Snuffsis> hahaha
<Paradise92> xDD
<Lucid> If I remember correctly, Lyra somehow had gained the power of invisibilty, and was trolling Bon-Bon
<Waffles> nyom nyom nyom
<Meanwhile> Dis vid.
<Paradise92> :D :D
<otakon> fluttershyfan158: hug her ofc
<Dashie_Dashie> IshBestPony, it's advised honestly, but not necessary.
<NxPaqu> Yay
<GentleHeaven> this looks fun
<F1uttershy> nyan
<jangledorf> YES
<Dashie_Dashie> I'd watch the series first.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> evening Ponies
<Waffles> :$
<jangledorf> sadly there's no ponies in this
<RAWRity> I wonder, when Spike hits puberty, do you think he'll get caught rifling through Rarity's saddle drawer?
<Lucid> It was my first pony dream. And I was so happy
<RaveBrony> dem nyan cats
<Pale_Horse> Aw...
<IshBestPony> but I don't haz time to watch the series :(
<Dashie_Dashie> but it's one of those series where you can watch the movie first, then the series and still get it.
<Meanwhile> Probably. He isn't exactly subtle.
<GentleHeaven> pony dream? do go on
<Pale_Horse> leek!
<Dashie_Dashie> I've seen it so many times .__.
<Dark_Horst> ponie's don't rreally count as a meme, you know?
<Meanwhile> SPIKE WANT.
<Meanwhile> *yoink*
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> if he hasn't done it already
<Dark_Horst> BUT!
<GentleHeaven> *brain melt(
<fluttershyfan158> me too..i would also take her home like my little dashie and raise her
<Waffles> celeryyyy
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> worst pony dream I ever had was me trying to revive Trixie, but she died
<Dark_Horst> we create memes of our own
<GamerGodJones> I know all the memes in this, so im proud of that i guess
<StinkomanFan> Once Spike hits puberty he'd be larger than Rarity herself
<RaveBrony> o.o
<Pale_Horse> That's not how you cook, Orihime...
<Spanner-pony> Leek.
<September> Oh please don't bring up MLD, I'll cry again.
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when the memes were everywhere?
<Waffles> bwahahahaha
<GentleHeaven> need to go book mark this aswell
<Lucid> No, he'd probably just ask her, because he's socially awkward
<jangledorf> I know most of the memes
<tgl1992> Hey everypony :)
<Meanwhile> Allo tgl1992
<ScootaChicken> playing guitar with a leek is hard...
<Waffles> hello there
<SaturnPie> 08,01i'd hug fluttershy. i'd glomp applejack. i'd brohoof rainbow dash. i'd fall on the floor laughing with pinkie pie. i'd nuzzle rarity.
<CountDoofus> over 40 memes in one song? MLP better be in there
<jangledorf> lots of my friends don't know what leek spin is though
<SaturnPie> 08,01but i'd totally tap twilight sparkle.
<Dark_Horst> sadly, it's not
<RAWRity> What better way to make damn sure your song will age horribly than to make it nothing but memes.
<OhioBronyShow> I know all of these, so I'm glad to say...I spend way too much time on the Internet.
<Snuffsis> Spike thne?
<kingqball> Lucid i had one were i was in a club with vinyl playing...and you canprobaly guess what happens next because of all the shipfic's

<Brony4Life> no vid?
<September> Rainbow Factor
<Cavy> PEGASUS DEVICE
<Stoneward> what is this?
<Coolbluemidnite> Rainbow factory <3
<RAWRity> People still keep saying it should come back. No, no it should not. What we got was good. Now let's leave it the fuck alone and stop trying to revive zombies.
<Stoneward> nice
<Lucid> Also, River is best Summer Glau
<SaturnPie> 08,01Tovler: only the fic

<September> luulullluul
<Noir> OK? i can hear the music, but i dont see eny thing on the screeen other than the end of the last vid.
<CrazyBronyDonut> i read Rainbow Factory after Cupcakes to balance it out
<RaveBrony> The fic was awesome!! I wanted a second one!! Hated the ending to Rainbow Factory....
<Tovler> SaturnPie: I guess it being banned was a SuperBrony64 thing.
<Dark_Horst> yeah the fic was kinda lame
<Meanwhile> I can't remember what it was aboutl.
<Cavy> In the Rainbow Factory...Where fears and horrors come true....
<Coolbluemidnite> I like the nightcore version better
<RAWRity> I can pretty much guarantee that the Arrested Development movie is going to be SHIT.

<Dashie_Dashie> Adam Tudyk was also in 300.
<MadxHatter123> He makes me think of doctor spock.
<Dashie_Dashie> fact well known
<Space> ... no emotion
<Lucid> Personally, I'd rather take Nathan Fillion over anyone else
<Ponybrine> fear leads to anger anger leads to hate
<Meanwhile> That isn't saying much, Spongebob Squarepants could kick Chuck Norris's ass.
<bronyfan> wait is that Buck from ODST?
<StinkomanFan> Then why Hasn't The Doctor saved any of OUR people? HMMM
<stallion1> halo is awesome
