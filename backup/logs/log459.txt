<K_A> Fake cigarette candies are cool.

<K_A> twilight_sprinkler: I can believe it. JWs (noticing a pattern with me?) shun media with "spiritistic" elements like MLP. In fact, there were rumors going around in the 80s of Smurf dolls strangling their young.
<Woodenfan> Scoot-Scootaloo: then what is NOT for communists?
<Kandarihu> Whoever was saying that this movie isn't anti-christian but anti-fundamentalism, I'm sorry for doubting you.
<StickySyrup> Saturn: AWW YEAHH! :p

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Moskau, Moskau something something something

*Litwick glomps Shizuka
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> glomps Sizuka*

<fluttercry> 05,15true. fancy risk part was much more fun...even if I did go...alone
*Obsidian glomps Shizuka
<Kandarihu> Credits are also important right now because it's the last chance for the peole who haven't turned in their lottery tickets.
<Scoot-Scootaloose> 00,03It's easy to dance! All you have to do is have no shame~
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> He's clearly possessed
*Ninjazz|Tired jumps on Shizuka
<HatsuneMikuFan> I wonder what will happen if we go back in time and showed them Dubstep, Metal, Fan Made songs, and pretty much everything
*Conyst glomps Shizuka
<TheXIIILightning> He's gonna get laid tonight!
<Brony123> THOSE BALLOONS.... ARE REBELS.... THEY DONT FLOAT...
<Kandarihu> people
<teh|Spitfire> *glomps Shizuka*
*FillyFlam does not glomp Shizuka. Glomping is so mainstream.

<EpicPwnTime3> da da dadadada da da circus! da da dadadada da da afro!
<Rain> I know a move called the "Firecracker". It requires a helmet and elbow pads
*OmegaMetroidBrony hugs Shizuka
<SunderlandPony89> IshCutFootloose: As do I. Modern music sucks.
<RAWRity> Midnight_Fyre: because they didn't think Kashmir was the best tune to dance to? Guys, I like rock music too, but that doesn't mean I want to have In Flames blaring when I'm dancing with a girl.
<Riders> Is somebody about to get served?
<Midnight_Fyre> RAWRity: There are a few Zeppelin songs that can get your feet tapping

<Spazturtle> 4/10
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dem scores of 10/ 10
<MI9000> KDNPFSDihgp

<Brony123> 7/10
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Always enjoyed that film, 7.5/10

<Dken2021> I give this 80s/10
<cowvarkian> I rate it 10 / lithgow
<Sharakan> and we all thought there was gonna be an epic scene on the bridge

<Cypresswolf> I'm happiest in my chair at the moment :D
<otakon> ^
<DeathStar> keven bacon dancing/10

<Meanwhile> Or ship me with him
<SunderlandPony89> otakon X Wrek the SEXY PONI
<Kandarihu> Well, go back to the scene where he was reading from the bible. THAT is the reason.

<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties: Dance, or get served?:D
<Sharakan> 8/10
<red_ony> 4/10
<PartyCannon> Ghosties learn to dance to kick ass
<RAWRity> otakon: I'm already shipping Saturn with like 5 different people.
<TheXIIILightning> The moral is *Everyone has the moves like Jagger*
<HatsuneMikuFan> Ghosties: Always Dance
<ZappyTheUnicorn> I'm getting tired. Night everypony.

<Obsidian> Bye ZappyTheUnicorn
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> dream of ponies Zappy
<MI9000> bye zappy
<K_A> 6/10. I'm not big on dancey montages, though they had its moments. The characters are complete stereotypes, and while I find the concept interesting with my own background, it was certainly not as realistic een.ould have been.
<cowvarkian> otakon x john lithgow x kevin bacon x joel hodgson
<Brony123> I NEED TO SAY THIS: Still a better story then Twillight.
<twilight_sprinkler> bye Soupcan
<otakon> don't worry IshCutFootloose we're getting TIME CHASERS MST3K after this!
<TheRainbowDash> d3rb: Highway to the Ponies is best highway ever.
<Woodenfan> gonna watch ponies :D
<otakon> it's gonna be GOOD!
<IshCutFootloose> Meow
<Sumica> 00,10funfact pick a WMC movie and get baned
<Midnight_Fyre> They'll just make a nice sandwich with otakon in the middle
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> So what's the new B movie anyway? Or is that getting picked during the break?
<d3rb> indeed
<Ghosties> 04I was gonna make a Jackass remark, but then I remembered I was thinking of Kenny Rogers
<HatsuneMikuFan> bye Soupcan
<otakon> anyway, too dead in here
<CountDoofus> Sarah Jessica Parker was in this? Dang, she old.
<SunderlandPony89> dis gon b gud
<Conyst> bye Soupcan
<Kandarihu> Burning the book of cultural legalism/10
<Pale_Horse> It's a MST3K movie.

<IshCutFootloose> otakon oh you'd like that ship wouldn't you
<d3rb> i wish to drive on that highway

*DeathStar dances like keven bacon :)
<kirzstryfe> 1,3are we baning people again Sumica? :3
<K_A> I just got attacked by a huge spider!
<sergio_scriptor> "singin in the rain" its still my favourite musical of all time
<Woodenfan> DERPDERPDERPDERP: MST3K. Should be ok, riffing makes it tolerable.
<RAWRity> 6/10. It hasn't exactly aged well, and comes off hokey at times, but it actually has a surprising amount of heart put into it, trying to give a message about growing up and becoming your own person. It's also so cheesy I can't help but love it.
<Big_Jake-intosh> MST3K and rifftrax make any movie watchable
<otakon> IshCutFootloose: no I wouldn't goddammit
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon x manechat
<K_A> I was sitting on the floor and everything oh god
<[WUB]JRP2234> has the lottery been done
<fluttercry> 05,15Remember, lottery tickets by the end of credits!
<cowvarkian> I believe you are kirzstryfe
<Woodenfan> Singin' in the rain was freaking HILARIOUS. So good, glad I saw it.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Woodenfan: Nice, nice. Which movie?
<IshCutFootloose> yes you would :)
<Ninjazz|Tired> Whoa... So, Sumica, if you pick a movie that gets WMC'd... You get banned? :c
<K_A> Anyway
<otakon> RAWRity: exactly actually, but cheesiness in movies physically hurts me
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: It's starting to warm up again
<Sumica> 00,10I think we should kirzstryfe perhaps they will stop picking bad movies cause they are bad
<TheXIIILightning> K_A: Did you have Fire at hand?
<Woodenfan> I forgot. DERPDERPDERPDERP, check main stream
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: what is?
<EpicPwnTime3> wut do you think of this film?

<Ninjazz|Tired> Hey Sylandest!
<RivaLz> Finally Ponies!
<Whiskra> I always thought Twilight had such a long neck in this episode
<Sciaenops> For some reason, Luna confuses my nieces.
<Brony123> Pointless COSTUME
<Sumica> 00,10only ban if the movie gets WMC'ed
<K_A> Anyway, 5/10. Too many stock and 1D chaaacters, stereotypical portrayal of rural towns that could have been a lot more interesting, and very, very white.
<Riders> And then Kevin Bacon went on to become a time traveling Nazi leading mutants in world domination
<Meanwhile> It's always this episode.
<Sharakan> i swear this is the most showed episode
<Woodenfan> derp
<Kandarihu> Sumica: I already sent in my ticket, and my B-movie pick is rather trollish. It's not as bad as Samurai Cop, but it's going to be memorable.
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: Doing well?
<Spell-of-Gaming> blink blink
<Conyst> I would read that book.
<Big_Jake-intosh> luna eclipsed....... again

<otakon> hiya Saturn, how do you feel about Wrek x Saturn?
<FillyFlam> "He was my best friend, and died alone and cold."

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Because bells are magic ofc
<Woodenfan> guys in the friendship is witchcraft version, what voice was Luna impersonating? Arnold Schwartenegger? Or Christopher walken? or both?
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: nay, there won't be any running, lol. Driving? yes. Walking? yes. Running? You're more likely to see Gil become a nun

<HatsuneMikuFan> Welcome back fluttercry
<fluttercry> 05,15Okay, now I'm back for real
<Woodenfan> Mad's too surreal for me. I love the magazine, but the show's a bit kid oriented
<crazypony> hinflutter_cry
<StupidSexyCJ> one does not simply escape bronystate, fluttercry
<pony_911> i only watch CN because of adventure time
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Gunthler: RaveBrony and panda_
<Twi_Fi> How so?
<Ghosties> 04MADTv was much better
<SparklyWaffles> |Discord|: XD
<Kencolt> MAD is basically an animated version of the classic (And nearly dead) humor magazine.
<Twi_Fi> What movies were shown?
<Biglaw> fluttercry have you ever played Amnesia: The Dark Descent?
<SteveCharb> thanks Darkts3 I needed that
<Ghosties> 04The animated show is retarded
<Firaga> pony_911: and regular show...
<Rain> ^
<Ghosties> 04But the actual sketch comedy show back in the day was pretty awesome
<MahBoi777> for the BMN
<fluttercry> 05,15I have not, but I'd like to
<SteveCharb> Twi_Fi: Footloose and that MST3K with the time plane
<|Discord|> Reg Show is like a drug...
<Biglaw> fluttercry same here
<Dken2021> Mad seems to sew two things together and hilarity ensues
<HatsuneMikuFan> Ghosties
<HatsuneMikuFan> agrre
<MahBoi777> were they good?
<HatsuneMikuFan> agree
<Twi_Fi> Ah Footloose doesn't sound too interesting.
<Woodenfan> I'm on Ustream sooooooooooooo...
<pony_911> Biglaw i played it.....
<Darkts3> Regular show is great
<fluttercry> 05,15Oh I read "the regular show is retarded." I was about to get down on some fools
<Darkts3> so is Adventure time
<SteveCharb> time chasers was hilarious
<Kencolt> Well, I'm out for now. Laters.
<Twi_Fi> I caught the very tail end of the MST3K time plane movie.
<Woodenfan> Regular show....I really don't like that show.
<Biglaw> pony_911 and now you never want to turn off a light again??
<Darkts3> love the backstory of a nuclear apocalyptic world
<Darkts3> xDDD
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Dream of Ponies Kencolt
*Kencolt waves.
<StupidSexyCJ> later Kencolt
<HatsuneMikuFan> Bye Kencolt
*DeathStar dances
<Twi_Fi> Needless to say, I was lost.
<SteveCharb> footloose is a movie that is almost inexplicably famous
<crazypony> bye Kencolt
<panda_> fluttercry: um... would you kick me if I agree with that statement? :(
<MahBoi777> lol
<Ghosties> 04Adventure Time is better than Regular Show anyways
<Woodenfan> sorry, guys, but Regular show is too surreal for me. I don't like the comedy either.
<pony_911> Biglaw that game @#$% up my mind
*Ghosties fkees
<SteveCharb> besides being the movie that launched Kevin Bacon's career
<fluttercry> 05,15nah
<Woodenfan> It takes TOTALLY RADICAL and ramps it up
<Dken2021> Regualr show is great, weird,b ut great
<Biglaw> pony_911 I enjoy that kind of stuff
<Everlasting_Joy> Neither AT or RS do anything for me.
<whippedcream69> nigga reg show is da shit
<panda_> I dont like the regular show or advernture time....
<StupidSexyCJ> Regular Show is brilliant I think
<Darkts3> Regular show at least makes every episode so random that you dont know what will happen
<SteveCharb> Twi_Fi: I showed up at the same time but I'd seen it like three times before
<Darkts3> thats the best part of it
<SparklyWaffles> Pretty acurate http://whatshouldwecallme.tumblr.com/post/18643024755/when-i-see-a-bee
<Woodenfan> I hate to sound stupid, but is there a way to show the computer screen on a stream?
