<Admin> I agree with >Death... #bronystate is definitely trolling... Just seen like 3 people post links and they don't get kicked... Wtf
<Shamroc> soo much openig
<Umbreon> what
<Umbreon> nice and cold
<Mutterguy> SunderlandPony89 , yes we do
<Kencolt> Evangleion is a long, tortuous , and in the end psychological minfbuck with giant not quite robots.
<Shamroc> opening*
<Spell-of-Gaming> Lucky Star is a manga with lots of references to anime culture. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> guess nobodys with me :3
<kirzstryfe> 1,3it opens up...

<Spell-of-Gaming> *manga and anime
<otakon> Admin: links are okay as long as they aren't advertising or vidoes
<FlareChaser> Well imma go play TF2 again....and kill everyone with my sentry gun.
<CupcakeWarrior> Lucky Star was the first anime I ever saw
<Spell-of-Gaming> ^
<Death> Admin: I was refering to people saying this was lucky star and then others denied
<cowvarkian> or video advertising
<HyperMetalLugia> Ssh
<otakon> THE HELL DOES IT EVER END!?
<HyperMetalLugia> You don't need to lie
<cowvarkian> no
<CupcakeWarrior> Thats probably why I hate it so much
<SunderlandPony89> GET ON WITH IT! Christ, the opening takes up most of the time for the acutal fucking show!
<HyperMetalLugia> I know you have a bad headache from the terminal
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<RAWRity> Personally, I think the first 2/3 of EVA are actually very good. The last 1/3 though? falls apart and NEVER recovers.
<The_Si> TANG'D

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ValtheJean otakon requested an encore of that vid
*Nittany_Discord 11,01loops

<Death> Nekked men
*Reikim resists hilarious spoilers
<Petrified_Discord> One does not simply "taunt the mods"
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: no, it's not complicated it's just confusing
<Admin> Play nice now... I'm not taunting... I could do way worse for taunting... Besides, I'm too tired for taunting... It is midnight after all
<cowvarkian> that is, think before taunting mods
<Kencolt> The first I ever saw was Astro Boy on NBC in thye early 60's.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: how long is it?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: I think it's 20 eps for the first series IIRC
<Kencolt> And refresh.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's strange. The troll is telling me to behave
<Litwick> Episode 1?
<cowvarkian> thats fun Kencolt
<otakon> ValtheJean: what troll? who?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 perhaps it's time for some of that good old power abuse
<Reikim> Kamina: Yes, he is insane enough to take on a giant robot...with a sword.
<otakon> oh come on! don't abuse your power AGAIN!
<cowvarkian> ikr ValtheJean
<Dken2021> I'm guessing this was the episode they have to wait until they wiat for the manga to chatch up?
*Litwick gets out camera
<twilight_sprinkle> ValtheJean: you can do better than that, come awn
<Admin> Yes, troll is trying to make friends, not enemies... Isn't that what being a brony is about?
<Rocklobster> thats it im fucking doe

<Reikim> I find it ironic that the most dangerous place on the Internet for trolls...is a chat/stream dedicated to colourful cartoon ponies.
<Dken2021> *shakes fist*
<Yahooz> Waaaaaa?
<Admin> What's that? Being nice? Oh Nevermind... You're a mod on a pony irc chat, but not a brony... I don't want to live on this planet anymore

<CupcakeWarrior> Shizuka: Whats so bad about the Clannad dub?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but that's an easier excuse than "I'm too lazy to press the button"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Admin well yeah it is, but it can and probably will get weirder.
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: My hard drive is WAY to full at the moment, so I gotta find a physical copy
<otakon> Shizuka: your thinking of putting us through terrible dubs aren't you?
<Sylandest> Shizuka: Clannad would be great, but not as a dub...but im fine with it either way
<Shizuka> 13it's not *bad*... not exactly good though

<Yahooz> MakerDusk: anime
<cowvarkian> sounds fun Shizuka
<otakon> SaxyPretender: it's EVIL
<Kandarihu|Mourning> My tolerance for fanservice is medium. I don't mind it unless a show shoves it down my throat.
<otakon> EVIL!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I...think I'd have to pas >.>
<TheHoodyNinja> Thats weak, Shizuka
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: No! It's a trap! No!
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is now attaches to Yahooz

<MakerDusk> Yahooz: so true XD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 >bronies >Mature
<otakon> Shizuka: why not Gantz while your at it?
<RAWRity> haha! now I have confirmation! I am now OFFICIAL! http://i.imgur.com/K5fma.jpg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Elfen Lied is NSFW.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hahahaahahahaha
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same for Higurashi and Umineko
<Yahooz> Double user powaaaaaaaaaaaah
<Sumica> 00,10otakon Vandread
<otakon> ValtheJean: hey! we watched Band of Brothers dammit
<mitamaking> Why are you on here if at work?
<LadyCanary> I've heard of Umineko.
<CupcakeWarrior> So much nudity in Elfen Lied
<Reikim> Shizuka: Or Higurashi?
<otakon> Sumica: it doesn't have that much fanservice
<TheHoodyNinja> NSFW?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> any chance for hellsing ?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, and boild into a flamewar almost every time :P
<Kencolt> SHot the kids. SHOOT THE KIDS.
<LadyCanary> OOH OOH What about Beelzebub? Or Beck Mongolian Chop Squad?
<twilight_sprinkle> CupcakeWarrior: and head explosion
<otakon> Sumica: besides, it's a interesting take
<mitamaking> The nudity is the problem in Elfen Lied?
<TheHoodyNinja> what TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<TheHoodyNinja> said
<Admin> NSFW is not safe for work
<TheHoodyNinja> damnit
<mitamaking> Beck was great
<Shizuka> 13that and the prolific blood
<Randomnerd> Hm
<Reikim> Why is he...
<RAWRity> I don't care about Elfen Lied's nsfw qualities. I more have an issue with the fact that Elfen Lied is complete shit, yet people constantly try to use it to get people to start watching anime
<CupcakeWarrior> LadyCanary: Whats Beck?
<Shizuka> 13story was fantastic though once you got past all that
<twilight_sprinkle> wooo the wave ~
<Kandarihu|Mourning> A show that has imagery that sets off people of a dirtier mindset than mine is okay.
<Reikim> I think he's mentally damaged.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3NSFW = Not Safe From Wrek
<otakon> ValtheJean: it did not, they were discussions that were calm and collected PLUS it usually wasn't even ABOUT what was on stream.
<RAWRity> NSFW = Not Safe For Woona
<mitamaking> I like Elfen Lied, needs an ending though
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Shizuka, the problem is most people can't
<otakon> Since I took part in TWO of them
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe Not Safe For Wooona
<Yahooz> Kirz: this
<Shizuka> 13like i said, if we were a much MUCH more mature rated site :3
<LadyCanary> CupcakeWarrior: A really fantastic anime, involving lots of great music paying homage to great classic rock bands. And the characters are pretty damn great.
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: anime about some guys trying to become rock stars. it's really really good.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity thanks for the ninja'd
<Sumica> 00,10oh it has alot otakon and i dont mind it just warning em about it
<cowvarkian> I probably would just be watching animaniacs
<Reikim> If we really wanted NSFW, we'd watch Queen's Blade, which is on Netflix, and I know because I accidentally tried to watch it. And on that note, I bid you all good night.
<twilight_sprinkle> eh, lets keep it at least somewhat family friendly
<otakon> adn plot shot
<Yahooz> Mfw iPad autocorrects kirz as kira o_______o
<Kandarihu|Mourning> I take exception when a show seems to say "Here are some clearly defined large breasts. There is lots of cleavage. You are ORDERED to have a boner RIGHT NOW!"
<RoboGerbil> dat plot
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Reikim
<Admin> kirzstryfe: Nevermind... I tried to help, but your explanation suits wayyyy better xD
<Kencolt> Yes, she is at the moment a bitch. Just making that clear.
<mitamaking> hahahahaha
<MakerDusk> XD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, that feel when Anarchy Reigns music maxes me feel like boxing
<mitamaking> I like her though
<otakon> Kandarihu|Mourning: that's Eiken, thankfully Vandread is not that bad
<LadyCanary> Anyone ever hear of Cromartie High School?
<RAWRity> Oh come on, we've watched "Lupin III: A Woman Named Fujiko Mine", surely Bronystate can handle a few boobs
<Spell-of-Gaming> Yahooz: And that's why I disabled autocorrect.
<TheHoodyNinja> And now slave
<otakon> LadyCanary: it's funny
<otakon> I hate Talho, she's a manipulative bitch
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity pun or not pun intended ?
<otakon> lol
<mitamaking> Lyra over subs is a problem
<CupcakeWarrior> LadyCanary: I think Ive heard of it, whats it about?
<otakon> had to move Lyra
<twilight_sprinkle> damn why did i have to tell val that saturn was gonna stream code geass, this would be such a perfect time for me to watch code geass
<Kandarihu|Mourning> I was thinking of Yoko when I wrote that.
<RAWRity> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: not
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> RAWRity k then i agree
<otakon> Saturn: what you up to man?

<ValtheJean> 2,14 the network admins can
<Yahooz> If your an ircop
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon be afraid be very afraid
<junh1024-XD> few days ago i was thinking of burning Katamari Damacy for PS2 and playing it on my PS3 (since i have one now)
<junh1024-XD> but turns out that it's still hard to play pirated PS2 games on PS3,
<junh1024-XD> zo i decided to emu it on my PC, the PS3 controller drivers are a bit troublesome though, but it works eventually
<junh1024-XD> i might see if i can find a 2ndhand copy of Katamari Forever for PS3 for cheap, though i put my PS3 back in the box when I finish ripping SACDs because i don't really have a permanent place for it
<junh1024-XD> i'm not really that sure I want to use my PS3 for gaming yet. Also, the seller gave me a 90 day warranty, which is voided if i open the case (eg, to get a bigger HD)
<cowvarkian> well, thats what different Ips are for...
<CupcakeWarrior> ValtheJean: So he can never get on ponychat again?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if people are evading our bans, the irccops can kline them, since it violates ponychats rules
<cowvarkian> >_>
<Sumica> 00,10I always read that as Ir Cop
<otakon> the hell, that seems a bit out of your jurisdiction to decide to ban someone from ponychat altogether
<Jaketehsnake> Yep. Bans are real. Cow was just permabanned a few days ago
<ValtheJean> 2,14 CupcakeWarrior: pretty much
<Yahooz> But thats only if you... Well are a dumb arse
<Sumica> 00,10instead of IRC OP
<otakon> and back somehow
<Yahooz> What?
<Yahooz> How?
<CupcakeWarrior> He came back
<ValtheJean> 2,14 otakon: that's the ponychat rules
<twilight_sprinkle> cant he just IP change?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3really?
<LadyCanary> ...BAHAHA
<Admin_> Bad this is being done from an iPad kirzstryfe
<Yahooz> Dayum hes good
<otakon> Admin_: dude, they are gonna ban you from ponychat, stop!
<Light_Latias> 12ouch
<kirzstryfe> 1,3are you really that attention deprived?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 evading a ban on any ponychat network merits a network ban
<cowvarkian> ok
<cowvarkian> whatever
<CupcakeWarrior> Poor cow334 :(
<Yahooz> Well he akready got klined
<cowvarkian> because there isnt the itnernet

<cowvarkian> just avoid the ban, geeze....
<drfsupercenter> 03assuming I get MultiMAN to stop breaking
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ban evading is a SIN and is a one way ticket to the firey depths of BRONY HELL, now, if you'll all rise with me, we can reach to the sky and praise the mighty Celestia and Luna and chant in song!

<twilight_sprinkle> i never payed attention to the old mans reaction..
<Mutterguy> wat?
<Dark_Horst> i notice that, even for anime, these characters look quite freaky
<Dumorimasoddaa> Though it must have been at some point given the backstories of people
*DeathStar dances on Mutterguy s head more
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: its basically a stylization, its fitting imo
<Dark_Horst> and whi makes faces like that?
<SavvySketch> outside of ponies I like most of the things I watch to be serious and complicated @_@
<dentidiot> tomato

<Sumica> 00,10best i can say is refresh the page and see if you can get a better conection.
<Shizuka> 13blur is a result of encoding, unavoidable

<Spell-of-Gaming> Anime with robots is kinda overrated
<Pinkies4thWall> WOOOT CODE GEASS
<SavvySketch> depends on how they handle the robots
<cowvarkian> not fake terrorists
<SavvySketch> a lot of it ends up lame
<Pinkies4thWall> /) ValtheJean
<twilight_sprinkle> Spell-of-Gaming: robots are a very minor part of this anime tho
*DeathStar dances on robots
<Pinkies4thWall> ORANGE
<Pinkies4thWall> LOL orange
<cowvarkian> ah, so those are what elevens are
*DeathStar dances on orange

<Monfang|Icehat> Code Geass was very dramatic. I never saw the ending coming.
<CupcakeWarrior> twilight_sprinkle: I hate Geass as well
<Sumica> 00,10mhmm, wonder if it's the same company that made my kikijoy adaptor so i can use my ps2 controlers on pc
<twilight_sprinkle> code geass is an amazing anime
<OtakuTom> I'm in the same camp as Ninjazz, though I do make an exception for any time Kallen's on screen X3
*Pinkies4thWall rescues Ninjazz and learns him the series
<Monfang|Icehat> However... One part of it felt just.. .wrong
*twilight_sprinkle eats CupcakeWarrior
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica: remotejoy can do that as well
<Ninjazz> I never said I hate it... I just don't like it very much.
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica: Oh wait nvm
<Sumica> 00,10it can be a hardware adaptor?
<Twi_Fi> NOOOOOOOOOOO
<Sumica> 00,10impresive software indeed
<Monfang|Icehat> Ya'll know it if you've seen it. Where Leluche applied his Geass on the wrong person with a horrible order. That felt.. forced.
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica: I thought you meant ps3 controller 6_9
<Pinkies4thWall> NIPPON BANSAI
<Monfang|Icehat> Almost as forced as the hibernation lesson during the Winter Wrap Up episode of MLP

The pony said as she lifted off the ground with her wings. "I thought at first that you gave the tree a name and was arguing with it and trying to get it to go inside, which is silly because trees don't talk or walk and I don't think
<Mon|WearingIceHat> they like being inside or else they would have built their own homes, right? Well, there was that tree during the school play but there was somepony in that!" She giggled as she floated around Rarity. "
<Midnight_Tempest> <_< >_> im not leaving yet...
<Umbreon> now i'm sushi again
<Shane377> bai Midnight_Tempest
<TheDr> cupcakewarrior: it had more story than a lot of full length films :) the only part i would have changed was when chrysalis owned celestia it made celsestia look realy weak :P

<Ninjazz> >_>
<CupcakeWarrior> Midnight_Tempest: But text is 99% of IRC's diet
<Mon|WearingIceHat> Well, now it's mostly a water hat.
<TheDr> cupcakeswarrior: i would have had celestia hit chrysalis and knock her back and right when celestia is about to end her, chrysalis would turn into luna causing celestia to freeze and giving chrysalis a chance to hit her with that spell, but thats just my idea.
<MahBoi777> I wish I had a water hat
<Midnight_Tempest> CupcakeWarrior: but too much can make it choke
<TheDr> Still best ep EVAR!!!
<Shane377> dat bg music Sumica
<Ninjazz> TheDr: Sounds better than Celestia just being beaten like that.

<Ninjazz> Holy crap, that a good tune going on.

<CupcakeWarrior> If you throw a hipster into a river, does he become mainstream?
<Shane377> haha CupcakeWarrior
<Spell-of-Gaming> I should buy Minecraft really soon
<DeathStar> CupcakeWarrior: no because a river is not the same as a stream
<Shirtless_Tempest> he just becomes another body stuck in the dam downriver... so nothing of importance was lost
<Spell-of-Gaming> Or I'll get called a hipster
<MahBoi777> this theme lol
<Shane377> Sumica: streamception please?

<Ninjazz> But this "reference" does not seem legit at all.
<Spell-of-Lurking> ^
<Spell-of-Lurking> And that's why I just listed it as a coincidence
<DeadpoolDash> this looks like so much fun...
<Dark_Horst> ...actually, you cant even list it as coincidence. becasue that would mply there would actually be explicit similarity between both
<Dark_Horst> like it's no coincidence that two movies can feature... people
<Claude> hey guys!
<Spell-of-Lurking> Okay, I'm going to go back lurking threads
<Dark_Horst> carry on then
<Ninjazz> That is lame as hell.
<Ninjazz> No epic cinematic or anything?
<Fattonie> lol, spawn you right on top of them
<Ninjazz> Just... END
<Phase4`> lol, not enough fule
*Claude rolls up newspaper and bonks Ninjazz
<Dark_Horst> and THATS what really annoyed me. the reapers catch you and that fucking screen is ALL you get?
<Ninjazz> Ohhh no.
*Ninjazz runs away from Claude
<DeadpoolDash> wow, one of my friends is going to hate this part of the game
<Claude> :D
<Dark_Horst> what the flying fuck, bioware? no ctscene? no tragic ending? no blowing up normandy?
<Phase4`> the normandy is now a scout
<Fattonie> they could make it skipable
<Dark_Horst> simple: skip by clciking
<DeadpoolDash> well there was a splash screen at the end of the game("Congradulations!")
<Dark_Horst> how most games let you skip intros or cutscenes
<Dark_Horst> hm... maybe something like loading on the run?
<Dark_Horst> it would be possible
<Dark_Horst> indeed
<Phase4`> XD
<Phase4`> spawn you ontop of reapers
<Ninjazz> Is it safe?
*Ninjazz looks around
<Ninjazz> >_>
<Ninjazz> <_<
<Ninjazz> ^_^
<Phase4`> v_v
<Fattonie> and much less probing than ME2
<DeadpoolDash> take this with you /)^3^(\
<Dark_Horst> lol
<Ninjazz> Mica
<Ninjazz> 20
<Dark_Horst> welp, saves ya work
<Ninjazz> Something tells me that the Reaper chases to death thing was a last minute addition
<Ninjazz> It sucks.
<Claude> moo
<DeadpoolDash> wait a minute...didn't you have the higher cap fuel in ME2?
<Phase4`> nope
<Dark_Horst> indeed, there seems tobe no real reason for that. i mean, reaper presence gets reset after every mision
<Phase4`> might have been able to get one but its 1k by default
<DeadpoolDash> lame
<Dark_Horst> they have absolutely no value besides making kundane shit annoying
<DeadpoolDash> harder
<Ninjazz> Miranda?...
<Dark_Horst> alliance: oh hey, this ship got upgrade out of the captains own pocket and effort? well then, let's throw that shit out then"
<Fattonie> fanservice pan
<DeadpoolDash> butt shots...everywhere
<JRP2234[Songs]> sumica has face is doin that thing
<Dark_Horst> BUTT
<Ninjazz> DAT ASS
<JRP2234[Songs]> hes*
<Dark_Horst> really subtle there, bioware
<DeadpoolDash> taking ques from the star wars sequels I see
<Dark_Horst> "shut up sheperd, i'm dramatic and you cant stop me"
<DeadpoolDash> walking talking shot reverse shot
<Ninjazz> None of you might not notice this... But Miranda has a slight jiggle to her breasts... I think.
<SkyPitch> meep
<JRP2234[DickShep]> so hes face gets bucked when he is a dick
<DeadpoolDash> she looks skinnier
<RawketLawnchair> http://i50.tinypic.com/141t3q.jpg Changeling Queen is best pone.
<Dark_Horst> JR
<RawketLawnchair> Or wather
<DeadpoolDash> like she got stretched out
<RawketLawnchair> Swiss Cheseelegs
<Ninjazz> Yes
<Dark_Horst> it'S because of his implants. being a dick is bad zen, hinders the healing process
<Dark_Horst> or some new age shit like that
<Mutterguy> got distracted by Whose line is it anyway?
<Dark_Horst> really, when they explained that, that seemed a tad too esotheric for future and implants and technology
<Dark_Horst> and all that stuff
<Dark_Horst> ...then again, they completely rebuilt him from a pile of charred flesh over the course of two years
<Mutterguy> including the brain??
<Dark_Horst> and suddenly, hey, sheperd is back, same old dude, somehow is councious stayed intact while being literally no more than fried bacon
<Ninjazz> Garrus
<Ninjazz> You are the man
<pony_7160> ...
<Dark_Horst> Mutterguy: well he fell from orbit onto a planet. i think that would pretty much fuck up everything in the body
<Dark_Horst> re-entry friction provided the barbeque and then splat
<Mutterguy> that's almost feasible
<Ninjazz> :S
<pony_7160> what
<Dark_Horst> ...yeah right. helmets keep asteroids intact
<Dark_Horst> suuuuuure
<Mutterguy> I said almost
<pony_7160> how does helmets have anything with asteroids
<JRP2234[DickShep]> hmmm hes face isent really dick like yet
<Dark_Horst> becasue shepard was an asteroid once
<Mutterguy> the helmet becomes an asteroid
<pony_7160> what??
<Ninjazz> the asteroid becomes diamonds
<Dark_Horst> that requires a big asteroid of very high density
<Dark_Horst> but we're talking about a squishy head inside a helmet
<pony_7160> astronomy is confusing
<Dark_Horst> not really the most dense or massive structure
<Mutterguy> if it has no oxygen it'd preserve his head
<pony_7160> then ...dead??
<Dark_Horst> well, the planet did have an athmosphere
<Ninjazz> lol
<Dark_Horst> pony_7160: yes, sheperd was dead. for two years
<Mutterguy> also the the helmet is composed of diamond rubber
<Kammerjunk|Zzz> Am I the only one who only get good ideas right before falling asleep?
<Ninjazz> Nope.
<Dark_Horst> he got blown out of his ship, drivted through vacuum for a minute, fell onto a planet
<pony_7160> the ending of all the ME are always the death of sheperd
<Dark_Horst> then cerberus picked him up and pieced him together ofer the course of two years
<Mutterguy> ...SCIENCE!
<Dark_Horst> pony_7160: actually no
<Mutterguy> with a STICK
<Dark_Horst> he died in the first one. got rebuilt
<pony_7160> the stick
<Dark_Horst> he survived the second one
<Ninjazz> ME1
<Dark_Horst> ...if you didnt screw up majorly
<pony_7160> heh...i never play ME lol
<derpy_pony> how inconvenient
<Ninjazz> Awwww
<Mutterguy> the reapers stoled christmas!
<Mutterguy> those bastards!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Night all ^_^
<Dark_Horst> oh those guys will get one hell of a field trip when the reapers bugger off with the citadel
<Mutterguy> bye SuperBrony64
<derpy_pony> night SuperBrony64
<JRP2234[DickShep]> but SuperBrony64|Zzz
<Ninjazz> Gnight SuperBrony64|Zzz!
<Ninjazz> Take care, silly.
<JRP2234[DickShep]> SuperBrony64|Zzz: u dident listen
<Mutterguy> inspection!
<Ninjazz> Spectre Fillies! /)^_^(\
<Dark_Horst> meh, screw ashley, tali's got the cuter helmet anyway
<Mutterguy> Blasto : Nanny for Justice
<ghostbuster> hi guys
<Ninjazz> ghostbuster, welcome.
<Dark_Horst> ...or should i say facebucket?
*JRP2234 slaps SuperBrony64|Zzz around a bit with a large trout
<Ninjazz> Well, you gotta admit... She got a lot hotter
<pony_7160> she dont even have a face ...
<ghostbuster> mass effect again?
<JRP2234[DickShep]> why would dickshep care fo rher
<Mutterguy> yup
<Dark_Horst> actually it seems like they wanted ashley to replace miranda in the "nice to look at, otherwise useless" departement
<Mutterguy> because tali away with the fleet
<pony_7160> VODKA TIME
<ghostbuster> drinks....
<JRP2234[DickShep]> i have a question....stfu
<pony_7160> heh??
<Mutterguy> that is not a valid question
<Dark_Horst> the new romance system is sneaky as hell anyway
<ghostbuster> sheperd can have sex with his crew....
<Dark_Horst> i played as femshep, didn't do anything that i know off, bam, suddenly the mail-console lady got pinned as romance
<Mutterguy> dang it. He should have parked us next to Blasto
<Chrysalis> ghostbuster or not, its easy enough to avoid it
<Mon|WearingIceHat> If I did play Mass Effect, can I make it so Sheperd doesn't have sex with his crew?
<Dark_Horst> i have no idea how the fuck that happened
<Chrysalis> Mon|WearingIceHat yes, its not hard
<Mutterguy> Mon|WearingIceHat sure but ewhat's the point?
<Chrysalis> Mutterguy you get an extra scene
<Chrysalis> if you have no love interests you get a scene with garrus
<Dark_Horst> Mon|WearingIceHat: and no, it'S not porn
<Mon|WearingIceHat> The fact that I can say that I had a little more respect fo rmy crew than that?
<Chrysalis> about how universe more important than love or something
<Mutterguy> aww
<pony_7160> hehe
<pony_7160> sentimental garrus
<Mon|WearingIceHat> but I'm old fasioned like that.
<Mutterguy> pony_7160 you need a name
<Ninjazz> Well, its not like its a goal or something
<pony_7160> i like this way
<Ninjazz> You can just be friendly from the get go
<ghostbuster> ...
<Monfang> Ghostbuster!
<Dark_Horst> well anyway, after that happened, later in the game i walked in on tali and garrus making out in the main battery room
<Monfang> How you doing budy?
<Monfang> *buddy
<ghostbuster> what
<Mutterguy> mica
<Dark_Horst> ...how the hell do you get turian mandibles and a quarian HELMET to kiss??
<Dark_Horst> i don't get it
<pony_7160> hehe ....gay porn
<Dark_Horst> wat?
<Monfang> Someone on Fox and Friends is wearing something that I bet Rarity would think was 'Fabulous!'
<Mutterguy> whisky- hell of a drug
<Ninjazz> You're watching Fox?
<Monfang> Yes
<Monfang> Problem?
<Ninjazz> Not really.
<Monfang> Awww
<Ninjazz> Just wondering why you would watch them after the thing they said about bronies, is all.
<Monfang> There's a pony on Fox
<pony_7160> i watch starworld most of the time
<Monfang> What are you talking about, Ninjazz?
<Monfang> You mean Red Eye?
*Mutterguy claps
<Ninjazz> Sure, why not.
<dshannon> olol
<Fattonie> dick shep is a bag of dicks
<Monfang> Ok, i want to teach you a word.
<ghostbuster> ....discovery channel
<Monfang> Satire.
<Monfang> It's a noun.
<Ninjazz> :/
<ghostbuster> and what is that..?]
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: what exactly did she say there about dicks? i lagged at the precise moment
<Monfang> the use of irony, sarcasm, ridicule, or the like, in exposing, denouncing, or deriding vice, folly, etc.
<Monfang> 2.
<Monfang> a literary composition, in verse or prose, in which human folly and vice are held up to scorn, derision, or ridicule.
<Chrysalis> hai RX-78-SleepyBot
<Mutterguy> Human bag of dicks
<Chrysalis> welcome RX-78-SleepyBot
<Ninjazz> Okay, stop right there.
<Monfang> It's funny.
<Dark_Horst> oh my
<pony_7160> dicks dicks dicks...lalala
<Dark_Horst> QUICKLOAD
<dshannon> anthro is all I saw
<Chrysalis> http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/5/1/2-SW9AnGSU6d43AqlUgJpA2.jpg
<Dark_Horst> DO IT AGAIN
<Chrysalis> link that to otakon if you see him
<Dark_Horst> REPEAT CONV
<Dark_Horst> O
<JRP2234[DickShep]> wait
<Mutterguy> anthrophcene (sp?)
<JRP2234[DickShep]> she?
<Dark_Horst> JRP2234: asari are single-gender
<pony_7160> sheperd has no soul
<TheRandomkid321> Hey guys.
<ghostbuster> ...
<Ninjazz> TheRandomkid321, welcome.
<Dark_Horst> meaning: it's a whole race of hot looking women. so the reproduction thing goes a little bit different
<dshannon> lazy
<Mutterguy> it was anthropocentric bag of dicks
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah, they can also mate with EVERY species and the offspring will still be asari
<Monfang> You mean like the Garudo from Legend of Zelda?
<pony_7160> hehe...gay porn
<Dark_Horst> somehow their gene-code takes the genetic information from the parter and remodels it
<Monfang> Or maybe it's all dominate genes.
<Dark_Horst> no
<ghostbuster> what
<Monfang> What?
<Dark_Horst> because they actually need the genetic diversity other species offer
<Mutterguy> I think they only need sex for genetic recombination
<Monfang> ah
<Dark_Horst> pure-blooded asari are somewhat shunned at this pint
<ghostbuster> so like when zues fuck a chipmunk born pikachu???
<Dark_Horst> becasue it actually destabilizes the gene-pool... somehow
<Mutterguy> zues?
<Ninjazz> Honestly...
<Dark_Horst> and has a chance of creating ardat-yahkshi
<Monfang> Ninjazz, another thing
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Espeon10) 11WB10»11•. 10- Make a boat or something out of it.

<Ninjazz> Hmmm?
<Dark_Horst> i do think they mentioned that
<Dark_Horst> the chance is small
<Dark_Horst> but it is there
<Mutterguy> Hurray!
<Mutterguy> grandparents
<Dark_Horst> arent we awesome like that?
<Invi> mooien everypony ^^
<pony_7160> SCIENCE !!!! YAY
<Ninjazz> Invi, welcome!
<Spell-of-Lurking> oh god
<ghostbuster> ...dragon age
<Spell-of-Lurking> I can't stop laughing at a Twitter trend
*Invi hugs Ninjazz
<Monfang> The comment was said on a show not only designed to make fun of everyone and everything, but was said as people's opinion. By you taking that and spreading it to cover all of Fox News Network would be like me saying that 'Vanella Ice Cream is bland' meaning that everyone here also thinks that Venella Ice Cream is bland.
<Ninjazz> :)
<Dark_Horst> oh and for anyone who didn't now, ardat-yahkshi are basically biotic sex-vampires. just tossing that one out
<Dark_Horst> ...and they kill you
<Blue_Leaf> Ello, Bronystate!
<Ninjazz> Honestly, why do you care?
<Ninjazz> Blue_Leaf, welcome.
<Invi> moin Blue_Leaf
<Spell-of-Lurking> "Boyfriend Video Made Us Wet" PFFFFFT-HAHAHAHA
<Ninjazz> I thought it was dropped.
<Mutterguy> Dickshep is about get medievel on ya arse
<Blue_Leaf> Thanks Invi and Ninjazz!
<Dark_Horst> Ninjazz: a quest in ME2 had you hunt down an ardat-yahkshi. it taught the players all that
<Monfang> Because generalization and judging by indirect relation is wrong.
<Dark_Horst> Ninjazz: they also make an appearance in this game
<Ninjazz> Talking about something else, Dark_Horst.
<Ninjazz> :$
<Dark_Horst> Ninjazz: sorry then
<Ninjazz> No, its cool.
<Ninjazz> Monfang: I was only wondering, okay.
<Ninjazz> Monfang: No need to get all riled up.
<Monfang> Now you know.
<Monfang> Not going to make that mistake again, are we?
<Dark_Horst> but yes, something i do wonder who the hell came up with the concept for the asari race
<Monfang> Amazons
<Dark_Horst> *sometimes
<Monfang> Space Amazons
<Mutterguy> FIGHT!
<Monfang> According to what I heard, they are Space Amazons
<Dark_Horst> WREY
<Dark_Horst> *X
<Dark_Horst> FUCK MY HANDS
<Monfang> Only if you lube them up first.
<Dark_Horst> ...actually... please dont
<Invi> dat look
<Spell-of-Lurking> Seriously? The Beliebers are stupid
<Dark_Horst> well, i had default shep. with the ME3 default shep wrex was dead and i got some noname whoever-the-fuckl-he-is krogan as their representant
<Spell-of-Lurking> The Boyfriend Video made them wet
<Dark_Horst> ....that guy was a real asshole
<Spell-of-Lurking> what the hell
<Monfang> I bet everything in scifi can be related to something that exists or used to exist on earth by just taking away the 'space' aspect.
<Dark_Horst> ...the hell was hat?
<Dark_Horst> i didnt have this ominoues camera drie in my game
<Monfang> And Ya'll are watching a stream....
<Mutterguy> Where da Krogan women at?
<Dark_Horst> fuck you, my dog lives longer than YOU guys
<Fattonie> i like having dickshep back in action
<Spell-of-Lurking> The reaction images for the trend are hilarious
<JRP2234[DickShep]> dicksheps back in the game
<Spell-of-Lurking> There's even a MLP one
<Dark_Horst> Spell-of-Lurking: i heard beliebrs. what is it you other guys are discussing ?
<Blue_Leaf> Afk.
<Noir> You should have taken Liara. for what reason, i'll keep to my self.
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: keep some room for the krogan knife shotgun
<Mutterguy> that sounds awesome
<Dark_Horst> it'S like a shotgun... but instead of buckshot, it shoots serrated knives.i fucking loved that one
<Spell-of-Lurking> Dark_Horst, I'm talking about Beliebers trending "Boyfriend Video Made Us Wet" on Twitter
<Dark_Horst> ....do i even want to know?
<Spell-of-Lurking> It's freaking hilarious
<Dark_Horst> tell me more then
<Noir> Oy, Beliebers are a pain in the neck, and scary when pissed off as a group.
<Spell-of-Lurking> Here's the gallery of reaction pictures: https://twitter.com/#!/search/%22Boyfriend%20Video%20Made%20Us%20Wet%22/grid/photos

<Dark_Horst> Noir: true that
<Dark_Horst> RainbowcrashNBurn: ME3
<Noir> RainbowcrashNburn: nope, ME3.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> i was thrown off by the scars, renegade scars have disappeared since i transferred to ME3 :S
<Noir> That is why i suggested Liara.
<JRP2234[DickShep]> why restart
<Dark_Horst> hooow come`?
<Noir> lol
<Twi_Fi> Will we see?
<Invi> i think we will see
<Dark_Horst> RainbowcrashNBurn: they come back with the renegade points
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Sumica: why have my renegade scars dissappeared since ME 2?
<dshannon> wait what happened?
<ghostbuster> ...

<TheRandomkid321> Why is Wrex so damn sexy...?
<Invi> use the force

<Renard> Any news of a Bluray set by any chance?
*Mutterguy might have to look into that
<Noir> oy vey
<Dark_Horst> you know that a game has an mazingly awesome and interesting story when you can spend 3 hours just watching someone else playing it
<d3rb> nope and this is just an assumption but i wouldnt hold your breath for it
<d3rb> nah dvd
<Fattonie> I seriously doubt they'll invest in a blu-ray set any time soon

<Noir> Hmmmm, if you dont romance tali on ME2 or ME3, Tali and garus would hook up before the end.
<Noir> I was just letting the others know.
<Twi_Fi> How sad for Garrus.
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Dark_Horst> goddammit, birdface, if you expect someone to hold your dick while eing, at least tell them where it'S been

<Noir> as for the PS3 vertion, i wish they offered a data install option.
<Dark_Horst> ...you read me the goddamn mail, mail lady. sjut up
<EpicPwnTime2> will there be any mlp this night?!

<Noir> Same here
<Noir> Oy, that hacking caugh is never good.
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: i feel offended by your accusation of me actually having PAID for my copy of ME3
<Monfang> And what do you mean by that?
<Dark_Horst> by that i mean "Arrrrr"
<Monfang> Oh that's a whooll lot better /sarcasm
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> He pirated it.
<Dark_Horst> it is
<Monfang> You are making PC gamers look like wonderful people to make games for.
<pony_1762> takes 8 days to starve, what is this logic
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Blame the publishers.
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: piratism does NOT hurt companies. it's NOT stealing from them
<Monfang> And you base that on?
<Noir> I payed for my copy of ME2, and ME3.
<Dark_Horst> there's a huge difference between filesharing and stealing
<d3rb> its not giving tem anything either
<Monfang> Like?
<Dark_Horst> people finally need to learn that
<Monfang> I'm asking you to explain it.
<Dark_Horst> stealing implies that you take fromsomeone something they own by force
<Monfang> How does not paying for something that costs someone else to make not mean stealing?
<d3rb> ^
<Litwick> g'morning all
<Monfang> Actually.. no.
<d3rb> same goes for music
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Litwick, welcome.
<Dark_Horst> the software pirates share as been bought at some pint
<somepony_else> hi Litwick
<Twi_Fi> HELLO Litwick.
<EpicPwnTime2> bai! gotta get goin for school then get ready for friday movie night!
<Monfang> Can you rewrite that to make sense Dark?
<somepony_else> bye EpicPwnTime2
<Dark_Horst> now tell me... if i had bought a game from my own money, is it not mine? do i not have the rigth to give it so someone i know without charging him?
<d3rb> its not theft in the traditional sense of a physical product being taken but by filesharing instead of paying you are effectively robbing a company of a sale so you might as well of takewn it from the shop[
<EpicPwnTime2> see ya at friday NIIIIIGHT!!!!!
<Twi_Fi> Bye EpicPwnTime2.
<Monfang> No, you don't have that right.
<HyperMetalLugia> !Pokemon
<ScriptBot> HyperMetalLugia, you are a 13Goldeen.
<Dark_Horst> and that is incorrect
<Invi> c ya epic... gone
<Dark_Horst> piratism is not stealing
<Monfang> If I bought a book that you wrote and printed, and I reprented it and gave it away, would it not be stealing?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Wrong media.
<Monfang> I would be taking away potental business
<Monfang> It's the same thing.
<d3rb> its similar
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> I don't think so.
<dshannon> 0.o
<Monfang> Then prove your possition
<dshannon> I'm scared
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Books.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Data.
<Monfang> Oh, simple enough.
<Monfang> Ebooks
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Fuck it. Im in no mood for arhuments
<Monfang> then don't speak up.
<Dark_Horst> piratism is not stealing. it does not lower the fortune of the company, it takes nothing out of their porperty. it does not lead to profit for any other aprties
<Chrysalis> Dark_Horst it does lower the fortune of the parent company
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Don't go starting arguments. How bout that?
<Chrysalis> as they do not get the money from the sale
<d3rb> ok this is an extreme example. if only 1 person bought me1 and the rest fileshared, do you think me2 or 3 would be made? no that would make terrible financial sense
<Monfang> You are taking away profit from them by proving a free source for a product that costs them money to produce?
<Chrysalis> however its not stealing because it doesnt remove the original
<Abbez1337> what is this for video?
<Chrysalis> its liscence fee dodging
<Dark_Horst> Chrysalis: no. it lowers the potential number of people who might decide to give them money
<Monfang> Thus, cutting into their market and costing them money.
<Dark_Horst> and look at the number of people buying it
<Chrysalis> its on the same level as people avoiding the tv license overall
<Chrysalis> and thats just a fine
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Dark_Horst: As long as you buy the music/video/software after you pirated it, it doesn't hurt them.
<Dark_Horst> the big companies make more money thn ever
<Monfang> what about the number of people who COULD have bought it?
<Monfang> Adn who actually does, Kandarihu?
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu|Mourning: wrong there
<d3rb> actually Kandarihu|Mourning has a point
<Chrysalis> I bought everything before i pirated it usually
<derpy_pony> monfang: their purchasing power doesn't magically rise by anti pirating measures.
<dshannon> :'(
<dshannon> It's love
<Monfang> purchasing power?
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Look. Downloading it because you're interested in it and not buying the legal product DOES hurt them. Now, if the product turns out not to be worth the money, maybe they do deserve to take a hit.
<Monfang> Derpy, what are you talking about?
<Dark_Horst> what you just said, kandahiru, implies that my money actually belongs to them. onyl that way it could hurt them if i didnt give it to them
<Dark_Horst> that my money belongs to them even before i aqquired the said software
<derpy_pony> it limits how much they spend on videogames. most of the pirates would not have bought it.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> I never said that.
<Monfang> Dark, let me explain what happens when you actually buy a game.
<Dark_Horst> i actually did that once. buy i gamei pirated
<dshannon> ........
<derpy_pony> there are no clear studies if the free pr the pirates deliver outweighs the lost sales there
<d3rb> collect sea ponies
<Monfang> You pay for the paychecks of a lot of people
<Dark_Horst> sword of the stars 1
<Chrysalis> The money goes to the publisher NOT the people who made the game
<Monfang> You pay for their businesses to run and for people to feed their familes.
<Chrysalis> your not taking money away from the people who made it
<Chrysalis> just from the people who paid them to
<Dark_Horst> it was a nice game, and then the collection with addons showed up on steam with a reasonable price. so i bought it
<Monfang> If you pirate a game, you are taking away the chance for money to reach those people.
<Dark_Horst> didntregret it
<Monfang> I don't care if you regret it or not, you are still stealing.
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Monfang> It is theft plain and simple.
<Chrysalis> its license fee avoidance not stealing
<Dark_Horst> but when i pre-ordered sword of the stars two i got panfully reminded why i picked up piracy in the first place
<Chrysalis> theft REMOVES the original
<Monfang> What do you think those fees go to? It pays for business expences like PAYCHECKS!
<Dark_Horst> becasue everyone who did pay for it got assraped by the company
<Dark_Horst> thoroughly
<Noir> It's easyer to buy than to pirate and crack.
<Chrysalis> Monfang no it doesnt, the money you pay for a game doesnt reach the people who made it for making the game
<Dark_Horst> even now, haöf a year after its release, its still unplayble
<derpy_pony> Ferenghi rule of Aquisition #11: Anything stolen is pure profit :P
<Monfang> So then you work within the industry then, Chrysalis?
<Chrysalis> it gets to them after they are paid to make another one
<Monfang> Because I do.
<Chrysalis> Monfang yes
<Dark_Horst> those are 40 buck the company stoly from me
<derpy_pony> that's what I meant
<Monfang> I've seen teh books
<Chrysalis> publishers get the money, not the devs
<Monfang> And that money goes down the line to the Devs
<Chrysalis> but not for making the game
<Dark_Horst> actually stole becasue they took part of my fortune without any balance
<Monfang> Do you think Developers just print their own paycheck money?
<Chrysalis> for making another
<Monfang> Someone is paying for them.
<Dark_Horst> and that is why i pirate
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Pirating the game and then buying it if you like it is, imho, the best way to go. Just the knowledge that these people (be it a few people or a huge development staff) worked on something that turned out well, buying the legal product should be an honor.
<Noir> The publishers fund the devs, you cant get every game development started through kick starter.
<Monfang> Kandarihu, I ask again. Who actually does that?
<Kandarihu|Mourning> This way, it's voting iwith your wallet.
<Chimera> Nya
<Viri> 14hi
<Dark_Horst> and i like to make this clear: i am not defending myself here. i'm explaining why i stopped bying overpriced things from already too powerfull industries
<Monfang> so publishers make money and then pay the devs. But taking away the revenue to the publishers, you take it away from the devs
<Kammerjunk> Beep boop buck the Nexus.
<Monfang> By stealing it.
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: that is quite the bullshit
<Monfang> Ya, that makes a lot of sense.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Monfang: there are people who do that. I certainly can't name names. But occassionally, I see comments in Torrentfreak from people who proudly proclaim that practice.
<Monfang> Vocal Minority, Kandarihu
<Kammerjunk> I am certainly not stealing anything. I am pirating it.
<Dark_Horst> the argument tat piracy hurts ANYONE is a lie told by the ones who want your money
*Shiny_Latias glomps Chimera "kitty!" xD
<Monfang> The scilent majority won't waste their time paying for something they get for free.
<Resonantwaves_> O________O
<d3rb> i think it would be naive to say that piracy hasn't affected pc gaming
<Kammerjunk> It's not like I would have bought it if I couldn't pirate it, anyway.
<Noir> Oy
<Monfang> Can you prove that, Dark?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Run, Resonantwaves_.
<Dark_Horst> there is plenty proof
<Monfang> Then show it!
*Resonantwaves_ runs the opposite direction
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Enough of a proportion of people that they can feel free to blast the people who leech everything without even bothering to buy the legal product.
<Chimera> xp
<Dark_Horst> take ea for example. they keep growing and growing while ea games are the most pirated games on the net
<Kammerjunk> I pirated ME3. I don't really think EA gives a damn.
<Dark_Horst> nobody hurts them
<Viri> 14school is such a mess -w-
<Monfang> Because they have a strong concole business!
<Viri> 14glad to be home now
<Dark_Horst> on the contrary
<Viri> 14how is everyone?
<d3rb> yeah they do, they are money hungry bastards
<Monfang> They mgiht deside one day just to drop PC all together
<Kammerjunk> Now, I would actually have bought ME3, but then I'd have to pay EA.
<Monfang> It's hard enough already to get good PC ports of anything
<Chrysalis> dd3 shock Bucking horror they are a company of course they are
<QT_Marks> even thoush EA was put as the worst company of the year lol
<Chrysalis> every company ever is the exact same
<Monfang> EA gets most of it's money from sports titles on the Concoles
<d3rb> i remember when pc ported to console, not the other way around -_-
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> ^
<Monfang> They OWN Madden and American Football
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: you do realize tat console games can be pirated JUST as well?
<Monfang> Not really, no.
<Dark_Horst> yes really
<Kammerjunk> I have a ginormous stack of pirated PS games.
<Monfang> The codes are a lot harder to break.
<Dark_Horst> i must know, i AM a pirate
<Kammerjunk> Yarr.
<Monfang> No, you are a thief
<Dark_Horst> indeed
<Chrysalis> Monfang no their not
<d3rb> YOU ARE A PIRATE! YAR HAR
<Kammerjunk> I am certainly not stealing anything. I am pirating it.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> I honestly don't think there's a gaming audience that's any more casual than people who only play sports games on consoles.
<Resonantwaves_> lol
<Chrysalis> its just as easy to pirate a console game as a PC game
<Noir> I perfer ninjas
<Monfang> Stop dressing up yourself like you are some kinda hero working against the evil Gaming Industry.
<Chrysalis> its just harder to get the console to accept them, which is a one time thing
<Monfang> You are a thief plain and simple.
<Dark_Horst> for every major game i looked up in the last year there were verisons for ps and xbox available to
<Kammerjunk> pirating (verb): Use or reproduce (another's work) for profit without permission, usually in contravention of patent or copyright.
<Dark_Horst> for pirating
<Resonantwaves_> Minjas!! :P they throw Surikens and then ride on them
<Kammerjunk> stealing (verb): ake (another pony's property) without permission or legal right and without intending to return it: "thieves stole her bicycle".
<Kammerjunk> Take*
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: no sir. you are just brainwashed. either that or dense
<Twi_Fi> You thieving pirates!
<Monfang> Do you have a legal right to pick up a game from a brick and morder business and walk out with it?
<Monfang> Without paying for it?
<Chrysalis> Mon, thats stealing the disk
<Dark_Horst> that is not pirating
<QT_Marks> thats different, that hurts the game store
<Kammerjunk> This whole conversation is moot, really. It's not like anypony will change anypony else's mind.
<Dark_Horst> that is stealing
<Chrysalis> not piracy
<Monfang> Do you have the legal right to copy the disk to a fresh one you have right in the store?
<Kammerjunk> Monfang: Imagine somepony steals your car, but it's still there in the morning.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Monfang: please try to open your mind. Piracy is a natural right. And it carries a responsibility with it, that many pirates actually fufill. And as long as more pirates fufill that responsibility, piracy will cease to be a problem.
<Monfang> Then it's still stealing, Kammer
<Dark_Horst> becasue that copy is an accoundet object, pressed on a physical medium which has a rescource wirth
<Monfang> NATURAL RIGHT?!
<Noir> I dont pirate, becuase my conchance would mentaly kick my own flank.
<Sumica> 00,10do you own the hub Monfang?
<Twi_Fi> This chat makes me LOL.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Me too.
<Kammerjunk> Oh right. This entire site is basically a pirating hub.
<Kammerjunk> It's not like I own anything I watch here.
<Sumica> 00,10bingo
*Shiny_Latias is bored in class -_-;;
<Monfang> What are you talking about?
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk i usually end up buying stuff BECAUSE i watch it here
<Chimera> ^
<Viri> 14lol
<Kandarihu|Mourning> We ARE pirating MLP on this site. Because the HUB is a premium cable chanel.
<d3rb> if you have ever streamed an ep you are 'steraling'
<Monfang> I'm not.
<Kammerjunk> Chrysalis: And I end up buying games if I like them.
<Monfang> I got the Hub
<Monfang> Channel 100
<Litwick> did anyone hear Sweetie Bot in the new Hub promo?
<Monfang> I watch it all the time
<Sumica> 00,10You watch Fim here with out paying for the hub network
<Viri> 14well Chimera, I hope you are almost over with it :3
<Viri> 14I had two hours of Law today x3
*Noir feal like watching Death to Smoochy.
<Monfang> I pay for the privlage to watch FIM
<Chrysalis> Heh, i usually end up pirating games if i like them, becuase i hate the DRM that comes with them
<Dark_Horst> what you do ot understand is that pressed exemplaries out of company mills are their property. it is part of the companies fortune. you take it, they dont have it anymore. data is virtual. copied data is not acciunted in their property. if you download cpied data, it is not soemthing the corp owns
<Noir> seals*
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Sumica: Monfang is paying for it.
<Monfang> I don't watch FIM here.
<Noir> feals*
<Chrysalis> pirates get a better experience alot of the time
<Kammerjunk> Then there's the matter of BMN.
<Monfang> Because I like the show, I pay for it.
<Dark_Horst> you takecopied data, they still have just as much as before
<QT_Marks> i don't get the hub through my cable provider, so, pirate all the ponies!
<Sumica> 00,10well good for you, how about any thing else we show here?
<Chrysalis> I have a massive pile of unopened blu-rays that i bought and downloaded theonline rip so avoid the damn adverts
<Monfang> Like what?
<Chimera> Just started
<SirGanjalf> @Dark
<Monfang> I don't watch the streams usually.
<Viri> 14aw :(
<d3rb> i get Monfang's point, if no one pays for games, the industry has no incentive to make games since there is no profit
<Monfang> I watched Legend of Koora only after I saw it on Nick.
<Sumica> 00,10ok so you just hop on your high horse then and start shit for the hell of it?
<Dark_Horst> d3rb: but that will never bee the case
<derpy_pony> the whole old system of securing the funding of development by copyright laws is heavily flawed and can't be applied. technically, tens of millions of americans are criminalized by it. we need fundamentally new concepts of intellectual property
<Dark_Horst> the amount of piracy will never surpass the amount of sold goods
<Monfang> No, I spoke up against theft because it is wrong.
<SirGanjalf> Dark_Horst: I'm not saying that piracy is like stealing. But it's like not paying for someone's job.
<d3rb> its not impossible but unlikely
<Kammerjunk> d3rb: But that's assuming no pirates buy games they like. Being a pirate doesn't make you an ass.
<d3rb> thats true
<Kandarihu|Mourning> You're making the common mistake of confusing piracy with theft.
<Noir> I perfer situational pirateing, IE down loading games and media that is not legaly offered in the contry that the person lives in.
<Mutterguy> this chair be high, sez I
<Monfang> And what is the difference, Kandarihu?
<QT_Marks> yeah, i buy every single game i like, but pirate games i would never buy
<d3rb> i have pirated games and music but i also have a stupid amount of music cd's and bought games
<Kammerjunk> Can't be arsed to copypaste the definitions of pirating and stealing again.
<Monfang> How is using a product without paying for it not theft?
<QT_Marks> plus i buy games i pirate if i end up liking it
<d3rb> some music i would not have found if not for piracy
<Twi_Fi> I think there are three definitions of piracy in this chat.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> What most everyone is saying. Do I have to say what everyone's been trying to tell you?
<Dark_Horst> SirGanjalf: wit all due respect, the companies i pirate from have lost every right for my trust or my money after all the shit they threw at their customers head over the years
<d3rb> ^
<Monfang> So then you steal from them?
<Dark_Horst> they treat their paying customers like shit
<Dark_Horst> no. i dont steal
<Kammerjunk> No, I pirate from them.
<Monfang> Did you use a product without paying for it?
<Dark_Horst> if that dfference between theft and piracy does jot go into your head, you should stop partaking in this discussion
<Kammerjunk> I use or reproduce their work without permission, usually in contravention of patent or copyright.
<derpy_pony> Such a question does not belong into a public chatroom, Monfang
<d3rb> stealing isnt the correct term, copywrite infrigment is (i think)
<Monfang> Then you stole, Kammer
<Viri> 14http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2600
<Chrysalis> its not stealing
<eaburdick3> Pirating is somewhat fun as long as you are downloading something that is old and has little or no monetary value... Don't go to tpb and download Windows 7 or something like that...
<Chrysalis> stealing REMOVES THE ORIGINAL
<Kammerjunk> I didn't take their property, I reproduced it.
<Kammerjunk> There is a difference.
<Twi_Fi> Main chat is sooooo intense!
<Dark_Horst> and pirating removes NOTHING
<SirGanjalf> Dark_Horst: Then JUST don't buy their games. Playing in them while hating company responsible for them is a bit schizophrenical isn't it?
<Monfang> Except for money from hard working people's wallets
<Litwick> Ok, how about we stop talking about privacy and say we did?
<Sumica> 00,10incorect
<Litwick> *piracy
<Monfang> How so?
<Sumica> 00,10if he would not have bought it to start with then the mony is not lost
<Lasharus> Oh no.
<Lasharus> Piracy-sophistry?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Yeah...
<Monfang> If he had went the legal route and bought the game, they would have gotten the money.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Welcome to an argument.
<Dark_Horst> monfacng, answer me this: just becasue the company has the HYPTHETICAL CHANCE to aquire a sum of money, does that money belong to them already?
<derpy_pony> hi Lasharus
<Sumica> 00,10corect but that is asuming he would have bought it
<Lasharus> I think I'll pass, I've just seen the dumbest argument of the day come by.
<Noir> War time dicount my flank!
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Monfang: You prefer to buy your stuff up front, right? You see trailers and read reviews and base your entire buying decision on that, right?
<Uakh|2> yay, another copyright theft / piracy flamewar ! \o/
<Monfang> Taht's a strawman, Dark.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Cya Lasharus
<Noir> discount*
<Lasharus> "I wouldn't have bought this food if I couldn't steal it"
<Lasharus> Specifically THAT argument.
<Kammerjunk> Lasharus: Could be worse. Could be an argument about religion. Those never end.
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: it's not. it'S the core of the discussion
<Monfang> What if the game wasn't made though a publisher?
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Uakh: it's an argument, I don't see a lot of flaming here.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, I would never pirate from indie developers.
<Twi_Fi> Shit, I just realized I forgot about the game because of this chat!
<Kammerjunk> That's just mean.
<Meanwhile> EDI is best AI.
<Monfang> How is taht mean and not th eother?
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.
<Monfang> What is the difference?
<Twi_Fi> Meanwhile, HELLO!
<d3rb> welp this isnt gonna end anytime soon and i got to get my rave on for friday night. later everypony
<eaburdick3> Allo Meanwhile
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: doesnt change jack
<Twi_Fi> Cya d3rb.
<Monfang> Oh?
<Uakh> Kandarihu|Mourning: there's a lot of potential here though. Everybody has strong opinions. It's only a matter of time before we can start handing godwin points.
<Invi> i go too. C y'all later ^^
<Dark_Horst> stealing REMOVES fortune. piracy does NOT
<Viri> 14hi Damos
<d3rb> cya Invi
<Monfang> So then you'd pirate a game from someone who doesn't go though a publisher to get their game out?
<Meanwhile> Bye Invi.
<Invi> c ya d3rb
<YoungDamos> HiHi
<Dark_Horst> you can not steal from someone what they dont own yet
<SirGanjalf> bye Invi
<Kammerjunk> Because EA is a gigantic corporation. Indie developers don't sell as many copies.
<d3rb> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEBbu-wkKrs
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Cya Invi
<Twi_Fi> It can be argued that piracy steals the potential for fortune.
<Monfang> So then it's ok to steal from walmart and not the mom and pop stores.
<eaburdick3> michael: hey there
<SirGanjalf> Kammerjunk: BTW: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/117071-Notch-Dumps-on-EA-Indie-Bundle
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Uakh: well, let's not pass such judgment on all of us until/unless it reaches that threshold.
*Mutterguy is bored
<Meanwhile> So we're discussing the ethics of piracy?
<Kammerjunk> I still disagree that I'm stealing it.
*Invi hugs d3rb Meanwhile SirGanjalf Ninjazz|SPAZ and Sumica for streaming
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Hmmm. Meanwhile walked in.
<Mutterguy> bye Invi
<Meanwhile> Yes. Yes I did.
*Uakh shrugs
<SirGanjalf> :)
<Kammerjunk> This entire argument is moot, anyway. Nopony is ever going to change anypony's opinion.
<Invi> bya Mutterguy
<Monfang> Piracy also ruins the trust developers have for PC gamers and they are just as likely to not make PC games anymore.
<Dark_Horst> sidenote. the game i told ypu about earlier? the one i bought? it was an indie corp. a small one. i thought hey these guys look promising, lets pay them
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Chat moving to fast to notive EVERYPONY
<Twi_Fi> Meanwhile, discusssing whether piracy and actual theft are one in the same.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> notice*
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Monfang: You prefer to buy your stuff up front, right? You see trailers and read reviews and base your entire buying decision on that, right?
<Monfang> I rent first and then buy
<Dark_Horst> half a year later i got rewardet for that thrust by being blatantly ripped off
<eaburdick3> Kammerjunk: I totally agree... The piracy issue is totally a moot point. Nopony is going to change anypony's mind on this issue, no matter what is being said.
<Monfang> Like how you can test drive a car.
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Well, I guess that's a good way to go.
<Monfang> Dark, I don't care.
<Kammerjunk> But if don't like the game, you wouldn't buy it. If I don't like the game I pirate, I wouldn't buy it.
<Noir> Piracy is one of the thous big issues that would be more and more important as we get closer to "the cloud."
<Shane377> hey back all
<Monfang> Having one bad experience is no excuse.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Shane377, run.
<eaburdick3> Monfang: Do you use a game rental service?
<Shane377> Ninjazz|SPAZ: why?
<Monfang> Yes.
<Twi_Fi> Hey Shane377.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Don't ask. Just run.
<Shane377> Sumica: who hates gamestop?
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: itÄs not that you do not care. you're locking up against any arguemnt that could prove you wrong by refusing to accept simple definitons and facts
<Monfang> Because all the arguments are weak at best.
<Twi_Fi> Basically, if you buy used copies and do rentals, you are hurting company profits.
<eaburdick3> Shame377: I DO!!! Worst customer service, and doesn't carry the games I want for my PS3.
<Meanwhile> That's how internet arguments work.
<SirGanjalf> I'd say that buying a used game directly for someone is OK. Gamestop etc. on the other hand...
<Monfang> 'I got burned once so why should I pay for anything.'
<SirGanjalf> *from
<Viri> 14!shipping
<Monfang> 'I pay for it later, I promise.'
<QT_Marks> lol
<Viri> 14ohh right x3
<Uakh> I pirate stuff that's not available in my country, like all tv shows with original voices (not the dubs). I used to pirate games before I discovered Steam because I felt ripped off too many times. Steam has honest prices most of the time. It's more a matter of convenience than anything else. If they was a decetly priced way to get poneis with original VA I'd get it.
<Shane377> Sumica: if they h8 gamestop who da buck else is gonna sell their games
<Kandarihu|Mourning> Dark_Horst: this is something a lot of people have trouble with. It's a common problem.
<Dark_Horst> gamestop is a good example. because other than pirates, they actually earn fortune with someone elses work without giving them anything
<eaburdick3> Uakh: I totally agree
<Shane377> them fat cats
<Noir> The game companys are not worryed about the Japanes market seens ther are laws ageanst used software and hardware
<Meanwhile> Well the objective of buisness is profit, that's why it exists.
<Dark_Horst> pirates utilise something they didnt create. gamestop profits of something they didnt create
*Mutterguy also miises the days of big manuals
<Dark_Horst> why dont you hate on gamesto for a while and call them thieves?
<Monfang> You want me to hate on retailers?
<Meanwhile> I hate this conversation.
<Kammerjunk> I hate vans.
<Twi_Fi> I hate life.
<Monfang> Lets go on to Walmart and Winn-Dixie then.
<IcryAlot> i hate feets
<Meanwhile> And doctors and lawyers and cops
<Monfang> Lets hate on them too
<eaburdick3> Hey QT_Marks
<Monfang> Because they don't produce anything, they jsut BUY things and then RESELL them.
<QT_Marks> eaburdick3: hey, lol just refreshed my chat though
<Dark_Horst> and tha gains them profit
<Monfang> See Dark. Retailers work because they BUY a product at a low price and resell it at a higher price.
<Mutterguy> civ 2 manual was something liek 200 pages and had a whole bunch of hisotry included.
<Meanwhile> Buying things in bulk is cheaper than buying them individually.
<Monfang> Because Retailers are better at selling than producers most often.
<Noir> Piracy is an issue that isnt just black and white, but meny shades of gray as well.
<Shane377> Sumica: so what about if they discontinue the line of the game but u want that game ??
<Monfang> Looks pretty black and white to me.
<Kammerjunk> Noir: How fitting to your name. But everything is shades of grey.
*Ray||Touhou sits on Viri's head
<Dark_Horst> not only does gamestop take physical copies from corporations without giving them anything, they actually profit of that. by your argumentation, that's actual stealing
<Ray||Touhou> 02hai :3
<Kandarihu|Mourning> The thing is, we're blasting Gamestop for something Monfang doesn't really understand.
<Monfang> Stealing is Stealing, theft is theft and pirating is just wrong.
<Shane377> Buying used is better than piracy
<Meanwhile> Everything is a shade of grey.
<Viri> 14eep! Hi :P
<Viri> 14did you beat something? :D
<Dark_Horst> this guy is a fanatic
<Monfang> Dark, are you accusing Gamestop of going to comapnies like Nintendo and stealing truckloads of games?
<cowvarkian> thats fun Monfang, im a pirate, yar har...
<Chrysalis> so much piracy arguing
<Kandarihu|Mourning> DANGIT! I'm getting kicked off the computer NOW
<Viri> 14on Touhou I mean
<QT_Marks> when you buy used, the company that makes zero money off of it
<Meanwhile> Mane chat fails right now.
<Kammerjunk> Hit up a P2P, then heave to. 'Yo ho ho' is practically yahoo. And why would I ever wanna buy CDs? A pirate's life is the life for me.
<Dark_Horst> yes. becasue they optain the copies the companies created without giving the companies a SINGLE cent for them
<Shane377> Sumica: whats ur opinon on online passes Sumica but dont they still get some amount of money from used copies
<eaburdick3> Well all, be back in a bit... Need a shower for work... ttyl :)
<Twi_Fi> I'm drowning in chat.
<Monfang> Because the product has already been payed for, QT
<Twi_Fi> The currents are too much for me.
<Monfang> The comapnies have gotten the money they need to break even and then some
<QT_Marks> i worked at a gamestop and they tell you that if you want to open a new game and take it home for the first night go ahead, then we had a used copy to sell
<Meanwhile> Yes, but buying used means the company has lost a sail.
<Monfang> After that, it's free range so long as it remains uncopied.
<Meanwhile> sale*
<Meanwhile> Your company has sunk.
<Kammerjunk> You sunk my battleship.
<Dark_Horst> Monfang: appearantly, you do not grasp the concept of data and matter
<Monfang> And that was company policy, QT?
<Shane377> u get a code if u dont have the code for online/ mp u get no online privileges <----- isnt that how most "online passes" are?
<Shane377> Sumica: ^^
<QT_Marks> from the managers mouth
<Chrysalis> yeah, i backed out when i realised how inflexible everyone was being with differing opinions
<QT_Marks> it does sumica
<Monfang> But is it company policy?
<Meanwhile> It's nice when this kind of stuff is only relegated to entertainment isn't it. Imagine how messed up this'd be if you could download the cure for the common cold.
<Chrysalis> not even a fun argument if all they do is repeat the same points
<Monfang> As in is it in the mission statement that you can just pop open a new game and take it home?
<Twi_Fi> Yeah, I felt like submitting my points earlier when it began, but I think it would be ignored in the shuffle.
<QT_Marks> company wide, no, buy by branch, yes
<Shane377> Sumica: its really only in my experience EA who have the online passes cause their dicks
<Monfang> Then it's a branch problem. Not a problem Gamestop has.
<QT_Marks> but** by branch
<Chrysalis> quite
<Noir> I have nuthing ageanst some one pirating a game that he/she wouldn't be abble to buy in the contry. (Such as the goverment banning said game by denying the game a rateing. or the company not porting game to your contry.) But i dont care for pirating a game that can be easly found and purchased by legal means.
<Monfang> Because I doubt all the branches think the same way, QT
<Shane377> Sumica: back then when u were getting chased what happens if they catch u?
<Meanwhile> You die.
<Twi_Fi> It's funny, chat was so dead earlier and now.....
<Noir> It just goes to a game over screen
<Shane377> LOL
<Meanwhile> And then god smacks you for asking questions with obvious answers.
<Dark_Horst> Shane377: game over, just that. no cutscene, no anthying
<Meanwhile> Nothing stirs up activity like an argument.
<Viri> 14brb
<Chrysalis> this isnt an argument
<Fattonie> you get a fade to black
<Monfang> Don't pass GO, don't collect 200 dollars.
<Chrysalis> this is a broken record
<Shane377> so if the reaper ships get u but on palaven arent there reapers there?
<Kammerjunk> Dat Monopoly.
<Meanwhile> Argument, debate, conflict, dribble, whatever you want to call it.
<Monfang> Meme

<Twi_Fi> Yeah, the points are being rehashed again and again.
<Twi_Fi> Is it over?
<Meanwhile> Do not pass go, do not collect two hundred pounds.
<Chrysalis> meh, an argument involves actual to-and-fro with points and counter points
<Fattonie> nope, you have to convert 200 dollars to pounds
<Shane377> Sumica: if the reaper ship get u u die but what about back on palaven werent there reapers then?
<Twi_Fi> That how it was, but then no one was convinced of the other's arguments sooo it became repetitious.
<Kammerjunk> 200 USD would be 123.716442 GBP.
<Meanwhile> Like I give a fuck.
<Twi_Fi> But now it seems quieter.
<Meanwhile> It says 200 pound son the game board.
<Monfang> I thought the USD would be less at this point... *sighs*
<Shane377> so back then Sumica there was no scanning thing like now so the cutscene couldnt of happened ?
<Twi_Fi> <_<
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I was actually replying to Fattonie.

<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Ponies?

<Kammerjunk> Oh, great. I thought we finally lost the discussion.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> ...
<Kammerjunk> Silly me.
<Chrysalis> hai rx
<Meanwhile> Shane377: Um, no. Nor is like "not" and noir is black in french.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> hello
<Shane377> facepalm Meanwhile its Sumica he can say it however he likes
<Meanwhile> Sorry there Shane377 I couldn't hear you over the sound of Sumica's foot in your mouth.
<Monfang> That's my evidence and I rest my case. If you have counter evidence, and by that I mean facts and figures not personal experience, you can show it.
<Twi_Fi> Hello RX-78-SweetieBot.
<Meanwhile> And everyone elses.
<Shane377> Meanwhile: u and ur foot fetishes Meanwhile u gotta see a doctor about that
<Shane377> Sumica: make fun of his mustache on babbling with bronies if he does
<RX-78-SweetieBot> hello
<Monfang> foot fetishes aren't a medical condition, Shane
<Meanwhile> Wow that was funny. How long did it take you to think that up. That was sarcasm, by the way.
<Monfang> It's better than most other fetishes.
<Viri> 14back
<Chrysalis> curse you mathematics why can't multiply be a consistant symbol, not context sensitive
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Perhaps if you spelled better...
<Shane377> i kno and iwas being siri Meanwhile
<Fattonie> out of curiosity, how do you personally pronounce your name Sumica?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> lol
<Meanwhile> Fuuuuuuuuu
<Fattonie> okay, that's how I pronounce it, so I guess you don't butcher it too bad
<Fattonie> almost didn't make it
<Meanwhile> And then everything went wrong.
<Monfang> Did Ditzy fall asleep while flying again?
<Twi_Fi> So they can guard the secrets of alchemy.
<Mutterguy> ok, need sleep
<Meanwhile> Night Mutterguy.
<Mutterguy> bye all
<SirGanjalf> bye
<Twi_Fi> Night Mutterguy.
<Shane377> night Mutterguy
<Chrysalis> but why use 3 symbols for multiply, and use one of those for 3 different things
<Teh> bai
<Meanwhile> He's terribly conservative with flamethrower ammo.
<Chrysalis> why not just have 1 symbol why meaning
<Shane377> Meanwhile: hows that bucking awesome mustache of urs
<Kammerjunk> You mean where Alyx is a troll?
<Meanwhile> I personally thought the flamethrower sucked a lot.
<Kammerjunk> I can't really remember in which episode that is.
<Meanwhile> Shane377: Moustachey.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I didn't like the flamethrower.
<Meanwhile> Because math
<Fattonie> lol
<Monfang> Pyro is my fav class though.
<SirGanjalf> kill the with fire!
<Meanwhile> I love Aliens.
<Twi_Fi> *
<Mutterguy> night Meanwhile, SirGanjalf, Twi_Fi, Teh
<Twi_Fi> x
<Monfang> After Engi of course
<Meanwhile> That film is amazing.
<Chrysalis> Twi_Fi and .
<Mutterguy> and Shane377]
<Fattonie> best chick-flick ever
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Once you get to using variables I only ever see * used
<Kammerjunk> Pyro is awesome. So flexible.
<SirGanjalf> I can't wait for "Meet the Pyro"
<Chrysalis> which when small means multiply and larger means dot product
<Meanwhile> Aliens is a chick flick?
<Kammerjunk> No innuendo.
<Meanwhile> How do you apply that logic?
<Twi_Fi> ()() ?
<Chrysalis> oh and no symbol also means multiply
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://shishioh-image.sakura.ne.jp/imege/SHF_OOO_BURAKAWANI_COMBO/7-12.jpg
<Chrysalis> so 4 ways of showing multiplication
<RX-78-SweetieBot> god I wish I had money
<Jim> ohai everypony
<RX-78-SweetieBot> so I could get things like that
<Fattonie> if you observe a lot of the themes going on in the movie, it can seem like a chick flick behind a badass sci-fi movie
<Jim> Mass Effect?
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Jim, welcome.
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Yes.
<Twi_Fi> Amazing.
<Jim> neat
<Kammerjunk> I don't like the helmet system in the game, so I just went into Coalesced and removed it permanently.
<Monfang> Yep, they are watching it for some weird reason
<Twi_Fi> Hi Jim.
<Meanwhile> Fattonie: I guess I can kind of see that, if you interpret it as such. But frankly I'm content to leave as it's meant to be.
<Fattonie> I know, it's mostly just a joke
<Twi_Fi> boooo
<Twi_Fi> Dat joke.
<Meanwhile> Lost a Krogan to a sinkhole. That's just embarassing.
<Meanwhile> Fiercest warrior race in the galaxy? Die to unstable ground.
<Twi_Fi> var cuteCat = "Hello"
<Chrysalis> ewww, i dont like languages with loose typing
<Monfang> Worst ways to die.
<Cypresswolf> Im out, be back tonight - if all goes well :) Be careful out there, everyone
<Chrysalis> yeah, i just ordered my first pony toys... http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hjktPjkkL.jpg
<Twi_Fi> ;
<Meanwhile> Not sure if "worst" or "worse"
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Cya
<Monfang> Worse
<Monfang> Sorry, multi-thinking
<Twi_Fi> Chrysalis, you buy pony toys! LOL
<Chrysalis> i wanted luna to be my first :(
<Twi_Fi> Just kidding.
<Twi_Fi> Chrysalis, :O
<Meanwhile> Well yeah of course there are worse way to die than asphyixation by dirt, but for a Krogan that has to suck extra hard.
<Chrysalis> not in that way you pervert
<Twi_Fi> :D
<Chrysalis> well, i wouldnt say no, but that wasnt my intention in the statement
<Meanwhile> That'd be like a Klingon dying from choking on gak.
<Twi_Fi> *gasp*
<Monfang> Was it in the middle of a battle?
<Meanwhile> No it was just randomly.
*Chrysalis trollface.jpg I LIED!
<Monfang> Oh....
<Monfang> Was he wounded from battle?
<Meanwhile> They hadn't even had battle yet.
<Monfang> .....
<Twi_Fi> booooo
<Monfang> Make something up
<RX-78-SweetieBot> SRW Z2 Saisei-Hen DYNAMITE EXPLOSION
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWHAeBODHec&feature=relmfu
<Monfang> His family doesn't need to know.

<Meanwhile> His parents are deeeaaaad
<Monfang> Say he died after tearing ten repers in half
<Meanwhile> Gut nacht Shane377.
<Chrysalis> that sounds so much like the mlp theme
<Fattonie> zombie ghosts
<Ninjazz|SPAZ> Night Shane377
<Meanwhile> Are they the ghosts of zombies, or zombies of ghosts?
<Twi_Fi> NIGHT Shane377.
<Jim> bai Shane377
<Fattonie> ghosts which are zombies
<Twi_Fi> hmmm
<Meanwhile> The flamethrower has suched ballsed up aiming.

<Meanwhile> Yeah, dunno what happened there it just didn't register in my mind.
<Meanwhile> Allo Xera

<SirGanjalf> Lithwick: http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/001/624/my_parents_are_deeaaaaaad.jpg

<Meanwhile> Critical Fission Mailure.
<Teh> SirGanjalf: haha
<Fattonie> oh god it's humping EDI
<Xera> What good's happening on the stream at this time?
<Jim> mmm plot effect
<Meanwhile> Mass Effect 3

<Twi_Fi> Indeed.
<Meanwhile> I hate Ravagers.
<Chrysalis> i was awake for 40 hours before having 5 hours this morning
<RX-78-SweetieBot> fun
<Meanwhile> They have such moody firing times and they hit like a bus.
<Chrysalis> any opinions i have are marred by exaustion
<SirGanjalf> Oh dear: http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/112/324/Batman.png
<Twi_Fi> Sleep is a disease.
<Meanwhile> ALL their parents are deeeeeeaaaaaaaaaad.
<Chrysalis> its just wastes so much night time
<Teh> SirGanjalf: haha deeeaadd
<SirGanjalf> Kill ALL the parents... wait that sounded wrong
<eaburdick3> SirGanjalf: Where'd you find that picture at? That's hilarious!!! /)^3^(\

<Fattonie> so i guess they are like the hulk
<eaburdick3> SirGanjalf: kind of like memebase.com... same thing except knowyourmeme explains them
<Bacon[Hazard]> ive been mic spamming this song - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkuSmJtRY8E - on COD Black Ops :D it was GRAND! :D
<Twi_Fi> Hey what's shakin' Bacon[Hazard].
<Bacon[Hazard]> im kinda bored now though
<SirGanjalf> earbudick3: Maybe, idk, i mostly get there through google anyway
<Meanwhile> Floating grenade is the answer.

<eaburdick3>
<Meanwhile> Da bugs.
<Meanwhile> You don't say.
<Bacon[Hazard]> so whats up with you guys?
<Meanwhile> They've got mutant gun barrels poking out of their sides.
<Ninjazz> Things happened.
<Meanwhile> Garrus, aka Captain Obvious.
<Meanwhile> What was that Sumica?
<Meanwhile> Ooooooh.
<Twi_Fi> Ugly bastards....
<eaburdick3> Bacon[Hazard]: Not much has been going on here in an hour or so besides the discussion of game piracy, and some other random conversations I'm not involved in...
<Jim> Ahem. Kill it with fire
<Meanwhile> Grunt is awesome.
<Dark_Horst> have you ever been so mad that you threw a rachni?
<Jim> Dark_Horst: This one time, at band camp...
<eaburdick3> Bacon[Hazard]: To be honest, I'm kind of lost at what they're all talking about. :-/
<Meanwhile> No, but I have been so mad I punched an Atlas to death.
<Bacon[Hazard]> :)
<Ninjazz> No need to recap.
<eaburdick3> Hey twilight_sprinkle
<Twi_Fi> HEY twilight_sprinkle.
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3: o.o i just got in, hai :D
<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, welcome.
<Meanwhile> Allo twilight_sprinkle.
<eaburdick3> Ninjazz: wasn't trying to recap it all, just trying to figure it out...
<twilight_sprinkle> how u gaiz found me? Oo
<Jim> twilight_sprinkle: Magic *snort snort*
<Teh> grunt = badass
<Meanwhile> Sumica: it's the most entertaining way to kill Atlas.
<twilight_sprinkle> Jim: oh ok :3
<eaburdick3> twilight_sprinkle: very easily...
<Meanwhile> Atlas's? Atlai?
<Meanwhile> What's the plural of Atlas.
<Dark_Horst> suddenly you realise that you liek grunt a lot more than wrex since ME3
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3: nyees?
<eaburdick3> Jim: you took what I was gonna say... *hangs head in shame*
<twilight_sprinkle> oh and yeah, hai gaiz :D
<Jim> Atlas > Atlases
<eaburdick3> twilight_sprinkle: nothing, just agreeing with jim, thats all
<Meanwhile> Implied IS the past tense.

<Meanwhile> Too bad Garrus didn't live through husk rape.
<Meanwhile> Use your medigel man!
<Jim> ouch
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: got no medigel?
<eaburdick3> twilight_sprinkle: I feel that this conversation is quickly becoming NSFW...
<Dark_Horst> there. no you have two baits B)
<Meanwhile> He's mastered bait.
<Jim> O U
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3: Oo i thought it ended
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: i c wat u did thar
<Litwick> Meanwhile, that\s just no.
<eaburdick3> twilight_sprinkle: I'm not sure yet... I'm not even sure wtf is going on yet... Just woke up a few mins ago and still tired :O
<eaburdick3> *yawna*
<eaburdick3> *yawns*
<RX-78-SweetieBot> KUUGA!　Revive yourself with burning blood
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3: yawna :D
<Chrysalis> For TUCHANKA!
<Twi_Fi> Wake the hell up, eaburdick3!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> KUUGA! Energy made of pride
<eaburdick3> twilight_sparkle: Unfortunately, when typing on an iPad with a keyboard, spellcheck doesn't work...
<eaburdick3> Twi_Fi: I am awake... partially
<RX-78-SweetieBot> KUUGA! To be strong and powerful!
<Meanwhile> Yawna is best pony.
<twilight_sprinkle> i just got back from my morning physics class(i hate morning classes) im tired too, i also stayed up late watching code geass stream
<RX-78-SweetieBot> NO FEAR
<RX-78-SweetieBot> NO PAIN
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3: ah, and no tab button either i guess
<RX-78-SweetieBot> KAMEN RIDER KUUGA!
<Twi_Fi> eaburdick3, okay then. It's best to be awake while in chat. You never know what could be posted.
<Twi_Fi> <_<
<Twi_Fi> >_>
<eaburdick3> twilight_sprinkle: Well, the keyboard has a tab button on it, but doesn't work here...
<Chrysalis> thats what she said
<Meanwhile> So who's up for some pom?
<eaburdick3> Twi_Fi: I agree
<Meanwhile> You didn't read that sentence correctly.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3: typing names sure is a pain
<Twi_Fi> Meanwhile, O U.
<Chrysalis> i wonder if you actually get it
<eaburdick3> No, I read it perfectly fine
<RX-78-SweetieBot> This is the song that never ends...
<Meanwhile> Well you're just a spoilsport.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> it just goes on and on my friends
<Meanwhile> Go pop small childrens footballs.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: whos up for some pomf?
<Chrysalis> i still have you muted on my xbox
<Twi_Fi> ;_;
<Meanwhile> Dohoho.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> :3
<eaburdick3> twilight_sprinkle: Would you believe I was k:line'd from this chat almost 5 times by accident around 1:00am EST?
<Bacon[Hazard]> Meanwhile: i saw pom :P
<Meanwhile> You see too much pom.
<Chrysalis> if only we could play with friendly fire
<Chrysalis> i would end you
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3: lol, thjats weird
*Bacon[Hazard] pom
<RX-78-SweetieBot> :3
<Twi_Fi> Some porn was already posted earlier.
<Bacon[Hazard]> :O
<twilight_sprinkle> Oo
<Twi_Fi> But very few commented on it.
<eaburdick3> twilight_sprinkle: I let my friends that were over play a game on my ipad while i went into the other room, and when i came back, they had been harassing ValTheJean and kirzstryfe to no end, and had my network banned several times
<Meanwhile> >_>
<Bacon[Hazard]> we are talking about pom not porn
<eaburdick3> >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3: o that lol, the "admin" guys
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3: that was quite entertaining to watch:P
<Bacon[Hazard]> twilight_sprinkle: what did he say :D
<eaburdick3> twilight_sparkle: Yes, unfortunately, that was my machine they were using so I got blamed for it, but was smart enough to write an email to the admins and explain it, and now here I am
<Twi_Fi> Woah
<Twi_Fi> HOLY SHIT
<eaburdick3> twilight_sprinkle: I guess they lifted it, cause I'm connectd again
<twilight_sprinkle> Bacon[Hazard]: well as i understand it was his friends, not him, they were just trolling the mods and avoiding all bans :D
<Bacon[Hazard]> twilight_sprinkle: no WHAT did he say?
<eaburdick3> Well, they figured out what proxies were and managed to get banned like 8 times for 1 hour, then got k:line'd like 10 more
<Chrysalis> would be nice to actually play with friednly fire though
<Bacon[Hazard]> :O
<twilight_sprinkle> Bacon[Hazard]: yesterday you mean?
<Meanwhile> Sumica: You're gonna kill it right?
<Chrysalis> get to shoot that annoying person who always walks in front as im about to take my shot
<Bacon[Hazard]> yes
<eaburdick3> Bacon[Hazard]: Nothing... Havent even got a reply from the admins yet, I guess they just forgave me cause I'm on now
<RX-78-SweetieBot> matches with randoms would be impossible
<Chrysalis> and throw kenne out the map if he does punchy punchy
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3: day was some epic evasion :P
<Chrysalis> most certainly
<twilight_sprinkle> *dat
<Chrysalis> but thats why they are called CUSTOM games
<twilight_sprinkle> Bacon[Hazard]: nothing bad, just some harmless mod trolling like "you thought you could get rid off me lol"
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and they'd have to make it so player's are affected by biotics in some way without it breaking the physics engine
<Dark_Horst> i have her on my carpenting crew. what will you do? B)
<eaburdick3> twilight_sparkle: Yeah, I saw the conversation history on my laptop a few minutes after they got k:line'd for the 6th time.. kept kicking my laptop off, so I walked into the other room and saw the conversation history
<twilight_sprinkle> Bacon[Hazard]: altho they were kinda pushing it by the end, i dont rememer what they were saying
<Stardust> how far into the game is this?
<eaburdick3> twilight_sprinkle: Let's just say, they're not coming over, or touching my ipad or laptop EVER again
<Bacon[Hazard]> twilight_sprinkle: lol
<Twi_Fi> YES!
<Meanwhile> WALK AWAY
<Meanwhile> NOOOO
<Meanwhile> YOU FOOL
<Bacon[Hazard]> that sounds like it was awesome :D
<Twi_Fi> BUCK YES!
<Twi_Fi> LOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Meanwhile> You've doomed us all!
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: calm your jimmies. they make for good carpenters
<SirGanjalf> Destroyed us all!
<Meanwhile> You've clearly never released the surrogate before.
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3: yep, thats friends for ya. you let one over, he sets some crap on your status in a site like fb
<Fattonie> no grunt
<Twi_Fi> Oh no.
<Chrysalis> players are FAR heavier than the Ai
<Fattonie> don't do this
<twilight_sprinkle> i didnt know shepard was a robot
<eaburdick3> twilight_sprinkle: Well, fortunately, that was closed, and password protected on my ipad, so they're not getting on that ***EVER***
<SirGanjalf> Grunt, noooooooo....
<Dark_Horst> well, he CAN survive the fight. i just dont know what the requirements are yet
<Meanwhile> I am KROGAAAAAN.
<Stardust> is ME3 almost over?
<Dark_Horst> i saw a video on youtube where he made it to the shuttle
<eaburdick3> twilight_sparkle: Well, going to get some breakfast, so ttyl.
<Meanwhile> He can lose this fight?
<Fattonie> NOOOOOOOOOOOOo
<twilight_sprinkle> bye eaburdick3
<Teh> *snif* why
<Meanwhile> My playthrough had him come through just fine.
<Twi_Fi> Bye eaburdick3.
<Fattonie> yay
<Bacon[Hazard]> just like Lord of the Rings :D YOU SHALL NOT PASSSS!
<Meanwhile> Like that.
<Twi_Fi> Huzzah!
<Ninjazz> Cya eaburdick3
<Ninjazz> Bloody.
<SirGanjalf> Bloody hell
<Teh> Yay!
<Bacon[Hazard]> :D
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: well a krogan can loose the fight. since i played defailt shep, there was no wrex but a noname krogan on the normandy and a noname krogrna that lead aralak company. that noname dude died
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: lose*
<Dark_Horst> asppearently, grunt doesnt thing so highly of dying and refuses to do so
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Just think, the game already gets incredibly messed up when you die while biotic charging, think of how it would react to a pull or singularity affecting a player, especially if they die from an explosion while affected by such
<Stardust> thought it was over for him...... guess this shepard had loyality with grunt
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: you forgot *default
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: I figured you'd realise that one.
<Dark_Horst> uhuh
<Meanwhile> I never had Mordin in my first playthrough :/
<Chrysalis> XD
<Chrysalis> all the broken physics :D
<Dark_Horst> hm... i had... with default... di yours die?
<Meanwhile> Yeah mine died in the collector base.
<Twi_Fi> I like Mordin.
<Meanwhile> Inb4 a gun that shoots thresher maws.
<eaburdick3> Thanks to the 3 ponies who actually said bye when I left for like 10 seconds...
<eaburdick3> Makes me feel good...
<Fattonie> put on the glasses anderson
<eaburdick3> *jk*
<Dark_Horst> go on tuchanka. people here MUST see that certain one incredibly epic cutscene
<eaburdick3> twilight_sparkle: Left, got cereal, came back, only 3 of 100 people said bye... wtf
<eaburdick3> twilight_sparkle: I don't want to live on this planet anymore...
<Twi_Fi> I said bye, eaburdick3!
<twilight_sprinkle> that was longer than 10 secs!
<eaburdick3> I know i know... just kidding
<twilight_sprinkle> Twi_Fi: i think he being sarcastic
<Dark_Horst> THAT'S the spirit :D
<Viri> 14Lighty :3
<Twi_Fi> Chat always says there is about 90 ponies on here, but most appear to be sleeping.
<Lighty> 06Viri :3
<eaburdick3> Twi_Fi: was being sarcastic... just thought it was funny that you, Ninjazz, and twilight_sprinkle was the only ones to say anything out of 90-100 ponies on this channel... ftw
*Viri hugs Lighty
<Viri> 14how are you? ^^
<Twi_Fi> Ponies, why you no talk >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> Twi_Fi: cause they animals
<Bacon[Hazard]> :)
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Pone
<Bacon[Hazard]> D:
<eaburdick3> Twi_Fi: I was wondering that myself...
<Fattonie> there's always only like a 20% participation rate
<Ninjazz> -_-
<eaburdick3> twilight_sprinkle: good point
<Teh> http://mlfw.info/f/1356/ :)
<Meanwhile> 90% of the chat is lurking.
<eaburdick3> Fattonie: that makes this channel 20% cooler
<Meanwhile> Except during movie night
<Meanwhile> In which case this chat is doomed.
<Twi_Fi> Oh GAWD! THE STREAM! OMGWTFEVULL!
<Meanwhile> And if it's muted, the side channels are doomed.
<Teh> http://fav.me/d3khkb5
<twilight_sprinkle> gah, i still havnet voted

<Ray> 02We should :V
<Twi_Fi> Uh oh
<Stardust> pardon
<Meanwhile> Unban who?
<twilight_sprinkle> eaburdick3
<SilverSonic|Android> Probably
<twilight_sprinkle> he shared his story just a few mins earlier o.o
<eaburdick3> Sumica: because I'm a nice guy and what was said this morning around 1:00am wasn't me typing obviously...
<SilverSonic|Android> Youve missed my show last week
<SilverSonic|Android> The OPPOSITE DAY SHOW
<Twi_Fi> It was a changeling!
<Sumica> 00,10oh it's you.
<twilight_sprinkle> well maybe 10 mins
<eaburdick3> Sumica: You can tell it wasn't be cause my username matches the email I sent the staff
<Sumica> 00,10heh yeah no one unbaned you.

<Sumica> 00,10dont cry Twi_Fi
<Fattonie> meh
<Sumica> 00,10it was the guy going around as Admin last night
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: he sais it wasnt him, it was his friends
<Viri> 14ok
<Sumica> 00,10quite foalish to cal ones self out
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah i have never heard that one before
<twilight_sprinkle> exactly
<twilight_sprinkle> why would he di\o it
<twilight_sprinkle> *do it
<twilight_sprinkle> if he were lying
<Meanwhile> Why do any of them do it?
<SilverSonic|Android> Bbl
<Twi_Fi> So many ponies......gone.......
<twilight_sprinkle> if he were lying he wouldnt call hmself out
<Chrysalis> so he has a party, gets pissed off because someone says his music is too lound and grabs a chainsaw
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah we have can see alot more information with the help of ponys like Makerdusk
<Chrysalis> i have no sympathy
<RX-78-SweetieBot> actually, it seems the neighbors attacked for the music being too loud
<Sumica> 00,10it was useing of proxies and other things that one cant just wip up on the fly
<Meanwhile> Unless he were making a clever ploy to make himself look innocent by calling himself out.
<Chrysalis> Troy Thornton, 26, hosted a party at his sisters hom
<Chrysalis> 29-year-old Mark Jorgensen, complained that the music was too loud.
<Sumica> 00,10any who
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Sumica: i just thought, how did the reapers appear in ME3? i thought they were stuck in deep space, and the collectors were just trying to make a new reaper
<RX-78-SweetieBot> unless I mixed the names up while reading
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: possible, but hes not doing anything
<Chrysalis> Troy Thornton decided to grab a chainsaw
<Sumica> 00,10evading is evading
<Twi_Fi> Meanwhile in Australia....
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: he said that he locked his ipad, so it shouldnt happen again
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Members of the Thornton family claimed that a person from the Jorgensen home threatened them by driving a car erratically at them.
<Chrysalis> Jorgensen cut one of Thorntons fingers off with a samurai sword for stepping in.
<twilight_sprinkle> yes Sumica and chairs are chairs..
<Chrysalis> Thornton struck Jorgensen in the arm with the chainsaw severing it to the point he may lose it.
<Meanwhile> Tell someone who cares sprinkle. Because I don't.
<Meanwhile> Twi_Fi in the legion of doom.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: youre a heartless mario.
<Sumica> 00,10If you cant wait for a responce and just come back in what is the point of it?
<Meanwhile> Yup. I'm ok with it.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Police were called out to both homes to separate the families. The police asked everyone to go back into their own homes.Several hours later, the feud started right back up after someone from the Jorgensen household tried to break into the Thornton home.
*Twi_Fi cries some more.
<Meanwhile> What shows were you going to put on Sumica?
<Chrysalis> presumably to turn the music down
<Ninjazz> Yes. A good question.
<Twi_Fi> wow
<RX-78-SweetieBot> so it seem there was a fight over the music, then the police came and broke it up
<twilight_sprinkle> what response
<RX-78-SweetieBot> then the neighbors tried to break in
<Meanwhile> The response to his ban appeal.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> the ones breaking in brought bats and swords
<Twi_Fi> Okay....*sniff*.... I think I'm done....*sniff* ....crying.
<Sumica> 00,10he sent in the ban appeal like 2 hours ago
<twilight_sprinkle> he thought he was unbanned
<Twi_Fi> Dr. Horrible FTW.
<Ninjazz> Dr. Adorable i see.
<Chrysalis> swords are a bit much
<RX-78-SweetieBot> the one who had the party had the guy with the chainsaw after swords were already hout
<RX-78-SweetieBot> out*
<Chrysalis> but not warranting of a damn chainsaw
<Meanwhile> Dr. Adorable is best doctor.
<Sumica> 00,10nope he was using a proxy to bypass the ban
<Chrysalis> roy Thornton decided to grab a chainsaw after Mark Jorgensen and several other men started arguing with his mother and two sisters.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> To be fair, what is he gonna do against swords, fight bare fisted?
<Twi_Fi> I though Admin was cow334?
<Chrysalis> he grabbed it before any violence occured
<twilight_sprinkle> what if this isnt his proxy and every other ip from him was
<Chrysalis> because of an argument
<Twi_Fi> *thought
<RX-78-SweetieBot> the line right before that: “Basically we ended up all in a brawl,” said Thornton’s sister, Nicole Thornton. “The guys from next door. By then there was 20 of them with bats, swords and poles.”
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle why do you care so much.
<Bacon[Hazard]> guys im making a fiction about the Mane Six getting teleported into different times in human history. what Era should Rainbow Dash go to?
<Ninjazz> Bacon[Hazard]: Modern.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Twilights going to modern
<Twi_Fi> <3
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<Dark_Horst> oh... extended?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: why not.
<Chrysalis> all that had to be done to avoid all of that was to turn the music down
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: way to avoid coming up with a decent reason.
<Ninjazz> I'm sure you've already thought about future.
<Twi_Fi> Lesson: TURN YOUR BUCKING MUSIC DOWN!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> it sounds like they have more problems than just the music, it was just an excuse for the feud to start
<Bacon[Hazard]> nope
<Airpuff> Approves song o.o
<Airpuff> Hai everypony
<Twi_Fi> Ponies be crazy.
<Ninjazz> Future then?:S
<Bacon[Hazard]> the future is too flexible... Modern and down
<Ninjazz> Airpuff, welcome.
<Ninjazz> :/
<Meanwhile> Allo Airpuff.
<Twi_Fi> HELLO Airpuff.
<Airpuff> x)
<Twi_Fi> Wait.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Applejack got stuck with Colonial America and Rarity in the Renissance
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: lol
<Twi_Fi> You aren't secretly a troll, right, Airpuff?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: that was a combined billion reasons
<Ninjazz> Awww Yeah!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> if it was just the music, then breaking in and bringing swords is a rediculous response.
<Airpuff> Twi_Fi what? =S
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: basically youre asking "why be nice"
<Ninjazz> Dat Rarity!
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: No, that was a rephrasing of the question "why"
<Twi_Fi> Bacon[Hazard], no Twi in the Renaissance?
<Ninjazz> ^
<Chrysalis> if my neighbour wouldnt turn down the music even after the police got involved
<Bacon[Hazard]> Rarity gets plopped down in France
<Meanwhile> Or rather, a counter question in exact opposites.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Paris to be exact
<Chrysalis> id proabbly break in to trash the damn thing
<Bacon[Hazard]> she will fit right in
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Wow
<Kammerjunk> Why are routers such silly fillies?
<Twi_Fi> Airpuff, I don't know who to trust anymore!
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: ok heres a list: its the right thing to do; i want to help him because i believe him; i believe in guilt until proven otherwise; i dont think he was doing bad things; no harm was done; i want this place to be hate-free
<Meanwhile> As for why not, because you won't change anything the mods decide and eventually just work yourself up until you do something daft and get yourself kicked to the moon.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> You just call the cops again. Breaking in gets you in trouble.
<Chrysalis> wouldnt take a sword
<Fattonie> trust zoidberg
<Bacon[Hazard]> all i need is Rainbow Dash... WAIT!
<Chrysalis> i have no faith in the cops
<Airpuff> Twi_Fi... Hmpf.. How come?
<Bacon[Hazard]> ANCIENT GREECE!!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: *in not guilt until proven
<Ninjazz> Just because hes been brought up a few times, why did cow344 get banned?
<Meanwhile> Plus, you could be wrong. As such, best to leave it to the folks who can actually check on those things.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: read what i last said:i believe in guilty until proven otherwise
<RX-78-SweetieBot> The cops love a chance to push someone around for not doing much.
<twilight_sprinkle> damn it,*not guilt until
<Meanwhile> What you believe is irrelevant.
<Twi_Fi> Giant hat
<Bacon[Hazard]> FUCK YES
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: lol no.
<Evil_Spike> Ooh song playlist
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: it is relevant to my behavior
<Twi_Fi> yay
<Airpuff> wat... xDD
<Ninjazz> Oh this song <3
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: i have standards/morals which i follow
<Meanwhile> Lol, yes. You can believe whatever you want, it doesn't change the outcome of this whole debacle.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> You break in and smash their music player, they can call the cops on you, and for quite a lot more.
<Chrysalis> but they wont actually do anything though
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: it does, ill say what i think
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: il lat least try
<Meanwhile> Your behaviour is also irrelevant.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: yeah lets all believe what we do is irrelevant
<Chrysalis> only if they have proof
<Meanwhile> In fact, you are irrelevant at the core of this.
<Dark_Horst> whi's streaming?
<Chrysalis> just dont leave evidence its you
<Chrysalis> then its all coincidental
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Yes, because you are the perfect cat burglar.
<Chrysalis> they can't arrest you on motive
<Twi_Fi> Dark_Horst, Sumica.
<Meanwhile> This isn't about you yet, nor will it likely ever be.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: you do what you want, sit and do nothing, ill follow my standards, your standsards of "do nothing" do not satisfy me
<Bacon[Hazard]> Ninjazz: is it a good idea to put Pinkie Pie in ancient Israel?
<Twi_Fi> Bacon[Hazard], WUT!
<Meanwhile> Your opinion is just as irrelevant as everything else you've said.
<Fattonie> twilight_sprinkle: so you're arguing for the sake of arguing?
<Bacon[Hazard]> its my fanfic
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: what's your upload rate right now?
<Twi_Fi> Bacon[Hazard], oh, you can do what you want.
<Sumica> 00,10600
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: and no, things i say may have some effect, and you cant know otherwise
<Teh> Rainbow road .... just got 20% more cooler
<twilight_sprinkle> Fattonie: you havent read anything else i said, have you
<Chrysalis> as i said as well, i would only do this if the police didnt do anything
<Sumica> 00,10why do you ask?
<Dark_Horst> that might explain why i'm having trouble
<Meanwhile> My standards of "let the mods handle issues that are theirs to handle" is good enough for me, whether it's good enough for you is, as always, irrelevant.
<Ninjazz> Bacon[Hazard]: Why?...
<Twi_Fi> Buck the police!
<twilight_sprinkle> Fattonie: scroll up where i listed the reasons why i defended that guy in this case
<Sumica> 00,10600 is normal for me
<Ninjazz> Bacon[Hazard]: Kinda random... I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING!
<Bacon[Hazard]> Ninjazz: idk
<Sumica> 00,10actaly if you have been watching for many hours I recomend a refresh of the embed just to clear out any desync
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: mods arent always right.
<Meanwhile> Implying you are?
<Dark_Horst> yes i did
<RX-78-SweetieBot> such hatred for police...
<Dark_Horst> didnt change mucn though
<Sumica> 00,10oh wait
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: ...no? youre jsut arguing for the sake of it
<Dark_Horst> right now t'S fine
<Sumica> 00,10audio is out of sync is't it
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: youre not even thinking about what im saying, youve just decided to argue with me
<Meanwhile> This isn't a democracy, the mods say it is, and it is so. Let them handle it, because ultimately you are irrelevant.
<Chrysalis> RX-78-SweetieBot they are so damn afraid of geetting sued for using too much force they dont use any
<Fattonie> twilight_sprinkle: yeah, and it's not gonna change what he did, or make him undo it
<Chrysalis> the police are basically useless
<Twi_Fi> mods = gods
<Ninjazz> Close enough.
<Sumica> 00,10sorry forgot i was still set to game stream
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: its not as irrelevant as you think
<Meanwhile> It is.
<Dark_Horst> i'm just having this theory that diverting 50 kb/s of my 350 max download speed so something else right now might be the reason for my lags
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I dont see that problem over here much.
<Chrysalis> no, but your guys have guns
<Twi_Fi> Dark_Horst, possibly.
<Sumica> 00,10Not saying we are infalable but any idea how often we get the my friends did it responce?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> British police dont have guns?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: no, but im not going into this part any further, ive had some time to analyze.
<Twi_Fi> They have batons.
<Meanwhile> And yet you still don't realise nothing you say matters.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Wow
<Bacon[Hazard]> Ninjazz: list of times so far - Twilight = Modern - Applejack = Colonial America - Rarity = The Renissance - Rainbow Dash = Ancient Greece - Fluttershy = Ancient Egypt - Pinkie Pie = Ancient Israel - do you have a better place for Pinkie Pie?
<Sumica> 00,10and for that matter breaking more rules does not help your case of i was't breaking the rules it was my friends
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: and you dont realize youre wrong
<Meanwhile> Prove it.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Okay, I dont blame you for not trusting them to be worth a damn then
<Chrysalis> and they can't use them without an inquiry EVERY time
<RX-78-SweetieBot> HURR I HAVE STICK DONT RUN
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: i can, but i dont want to for two reasons
<Meanwhile> Convinient.
<Chrysalis> yup
<Sumica> 00,10Please do stop argueing it
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: oh please, go play some wow. stop arguing for the sake of it
<Airpuff> The heck are you arguing about in the first palce? xD
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: do you really think im lying?
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: why the hell would i lie about this?
<Meanwhile> I don't think you're lying, I just think nothing you say matters.
<Twi_Fi> ouch
<Meanwhile> Anyhoo, we were told to stop, therefore I am.
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: thats the attitude of a pawn.
<Bacon[Hazard]> oh god...
<Airpuff> Nom~
<Meanwhile> Numnumnumnumnumnum
<Ninjazz> Bacon[Hazard]: How bout Vietnam era America?
<Twi_Fi> So Bacon[Hazard], why your name bacon?
<Sumica> 00,10Dash in a dogfight era eh?
<Twi_Fi> le sigh
<twilight_sprinkle> sigh, im not even enjyoing code geass PMV...
<Meanwhile> I don't even know what Code Geass is.
<Ninjazz> Good
<Airpuff> That art.. wow neat *-*
<Twi_Fi> :_:
<Bacon[Hazard]> Ninjazz: i got it... Fluttershy to the Middle Ages and Pinkie Pie to Egypt
<Bacon[Hazard]> :)
<Dark_Horst> aaaand im back
<Airpuff> What are you talking about bacon? xD
<Twi_Fi> wb Dark_Horst.
<Dark_Horst> wireless connection died for a second
<Ninjazz> Disregard my suggestion completely why don't you. :'(
<Bacon[Hazard]> Airpuff: my fic :) im gathering ideas
<Bacon[Hazard]> Ninjazz: im sorry :(
<Airpuff> ô.o Puttin each pony to a diffrent era and country?
<Meanwhile> Dat tree.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Airpuff: just to different times
<Twi_Fi> .....so sad
<Bacon[Hazard]> and a different world :)
*Twi_Fi still thinks Twilight should be in Renaissance period....
<Airpuff> Oo I see x)
<Ninjazz> ^
<Bacon[Hazard]> but Rarity would like to be in Paris :(
<Ninjazz> Nothing says Twilight like Leonardo Da Vinci
<Bacon[Hazard]> riiiight...
<Bacon[Hazard]> fuck... were at an impass
<Ninjazz> Its your fic though
<Twi_Fi> ^
<Meanwhile> So whatever you wanna do is fine.
<Ninjazz> Were just suggesting what would make sense.
<Airpuff> .. Dont see the connection between twilight and leaonardo......
<Ninjazz> >.>
<Bacon[Hazard]> Airpuff: he was a great inventor
<Meanwhile> They're both smart.
<Meanwhile> That's about it really.
<Airpuff> Hmpf..
<Airpuff> Why not something like Einstein then? xD
<Bacon[Hazard]> Colonial America for the win?
<Meanwhile> Leonardo Da Vinci was brilliant, but an immense procrastinator with superstitious beliefs.
<Bacon[Hazard]> quite :)
<Meanwhile> Twilight is brilliant and can't go through a day without making a checklist.
<Airpuff> He was alot. Which is why it dosent fit completely =S
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Rainbow Dash is going to be a Spartan :D
<Cayan> The best times to be here are the times that i have to leave :D
<Twi_Fi> To me, the Renaissance period was a time for advances in every intellectual and creative endeavor, as well as a time where magic and science were explored.
<Airpuff> Dont see how Twilight is an inventor or artist or "doctor"
<Meanwhile> They don't have much in common, but they could potentially mesh quite well.
<Bacon[Hazard]> and what does Rarity do? Create.
<Meanwhile> They'd compliment each other neatly in the right context.
<Airpuff> Intellectually yeah.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Fabulous Dresses.
<Ninjazz> My brain has litterally turned off it seems.
<RDashie> woooo sup bronies?
<Twi_Fi> Hey RDashie.
<Meanwhile> Allo RDashie.
<Teh> hey RDashie
<Bacon[Hazard]> sup
<Ninjazz> RDashie, welcome.
*Meanwhile electrocutes Ninjazz's head.
<Ninjazz> @_@
<RDashie> chicken :D
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Cops here usually have at least two guns, their standard issued one, then a personal one as a backup, usually a small boot gun or such
<Airpuff> 6_9
<Meanwhile> Righto
<Chrysalis> yup, also your cops never go around on bicycles
<Ninjazz2> Coffee always helps me in my time of need.
<RDashie> i love lyra just sitting there beeing happy
<Ninjazz2> Time to go get some.
<Meanwhile> Seapony Lyra is best Lyra.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> There are bike cops here, usually in mid-size cities or large towns
<Twi_Fi> The Ninjazzes have been doubled.
<RDashie> XD
<Bacon[Hazard]> what should Pinkie do in Egypt?
<Meanwhile> Whose line is it anyway was absolutely awesome.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> some non-coastal western towns even have horse cops
<Sumica> 00,10model for the sphinx
<Bacon[Hazard]> :D
<Bacon[Hazard]> BRILLIANT
<Airpuff> lol
<Meanwhile> Streamer mummies.
<Chrysalis> yeah same
<Chrysalis> its laughable really
<Bacon[Hazard]> that IS brilliant :D
<Twi_Fi> wut
<Cayan> Yes.this.
<Meanwhile> Cupcake hieroglyphics.
<Chrysalis> horses dont make you imposing, they just give you more stuff to deal with
<Meanwhile> A cat that looks suspiciously like Opal.
<Bacon[Hazard]> IDEAAAAA
<RX-78-SweetieBot> It actually makes some sense to have cops on vehicles that can go through small alleys, and horses fit for towns without many roads
<Meanwhile> Osiris is now a pony.
<Meanwhile> Ra is now Celestia.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> but yeah, having them in a regular city would be terrible
<Bacon[Hazard]> Twilight will be picked up by an archeologist! they go to Egypt and see Pinkie Pie on the walls! PERFECTION!
<Airpuff> >.<
<Twi_Fi> Bacon[Hazard], :O
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://images.4chan.org/jp/src/1336108355672.jpg
<Dark92Enigma> Say that ten times fast
<Meanwhile> Urgh, I can't believe I'm brain storming. I haven't needed to brainstorm in forever.
<Dark92Enigma> Hello Everypony this is your #Enigma signing ON!
<Sumica> 00,10I say take normal historical things and sub ponies in
<Bacon[Hazard]> well what did you expect? all of them to meet eachother in the Modern age? they WOULD be all dead from old age :P

<Twi_Fi> These voices don't match.
<Sumica> 00,10oh right favs can go past 200 videos
<Dark92Enigma> But the sounds do match!
<Twi_Fi> Well some do.

<Meanwhile> Dat throw.
<Chrysalis> when making a point in 2d space, make sure your setting both the x and the y, not just setting the x twice
<Dark92Enigma> Twily looked cute in that scene.<3
<Ninjazz> I think I heard rumors about an expantion on the original 13 episode plan.
<Chrysalis> i need to go eat something very high in sugar
<Twi_Fi> Indeed
<Dark92Enigma> Give 'em hell boys FOR EQUESTRIA!!!!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Clearly you need a Minovsky Biosensor to help focus that rage into energy.
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<Meanwhile> Imgonna headbuttcha!
<Sumica> 00,10Well yeah the rumor mill says 2 studios doing 13 eps each
<Chrysalis> god this is how otakon must feel every moment of his life
<Saturn> 8,1HAPPY STAR WARS DAY!

<Dark92Enigma> IS IT STAR WARS DAY!?
<Saturn> 8,1also, i just took delivery of a 40" HDTV
<Sumica> 00,10seeing as it's not studio B confermed doing eps

<Sumica> 00,10seems legit
<Meanwhile> Chocolate rain is best rain.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Goon humor.
<Ninjazz> I think I heard someone at school talk about it too.
<Lasharus> Yeah, apparently it was implemented by a guy with a lisp.
<Sumica> 00,10bleh I should be sleeping seeing as I have movie night to stream in 8.5 hours
<Dark_Horst> i dont know what'S worse. the failed australian accent of the sniper or the faield german accent of the medic

<Sumica> 00,10well yeah now i realy do
<Meanwhile> <_>
<flutter_spin> It is a subtle reference, but still awesome
<Meanwhile> Bootleg toys are hilarious in ways you don't even know.
<Dark92Enigma> too subtle!
<Dark92Enigma> lol
<cowvarkian> You have dreams Ninjazz, you just dont remember them
<Ninjazz> You must make him the main character!
<Sumica> 00,10Good i need more fics to read at work. it's been a dead week
<Ninjazz> cowvarkian: You're probably right actually.
<Dark_Horst> Ninjazz: memorizing dreams can be learned. look it up. writing stuff down has to do with it
<Meanwhile> Inb4 you go to read at work Sumica and suddenly influx of stuff to do.
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: You sleep alot? Like.. for long?
<flutter_spin> 16,000 words. I feel like it took eternity to write and edit
<ekips> ohai #bronystate
