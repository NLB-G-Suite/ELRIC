<Noob709> Plus you don't have stream powers.

<Sumica> 00,10the only good thing to come out during the holywood writer strike
<PinkiePry> Hai everypony :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello PinkiePry
<Sumica> 00,10iDrive
<Noob709> e
<Ponies47> Hey PinkiePry
<Kandarihu> Yeah
<Ponies47> Chat is dead
<Sumica> 00,10it's a love story about villan to be meets girl
<Sumica> 00,10how is he useing a touch pad with gloves?
<PinkiePry> R.I.P chat. :'(
<PinkiePry> :D
<XAX> Shizuka: That song you linked made the fight in the lab beyond awesome.
<Shizuka> 13ikr
<Shizuka> 13i barely made it my first try, then realize there was a whole section of the lab i hadn't got to explore, plus that achievement for the experiments
<Shizuka> 13so i started the chapter over, didn't regret it when the boss fight kicked in again :3
<Shizuka> 13still haven't got that fifth experiment though..
<Sumica> 00,10I presume it's later in the game Shizuka
<DerpDash> Hey Everypony! :)
<Sumica> 00,10hey DerpDash
<Ponies47> Hey DerpDash
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DerpDash
<Shizuka> 13i assume it's in aquatics but on the second go i still couldn't do anything there but purge with the tesla coil... and it didn't give me an update for it like the first tesla coil with the bullsquid
<Aircrafter> Bye Bye everypony.
<XAX> Sumica: Questionable Ethics. So yeah, bout 2/3s of the way through the game.
<DerpDash> bye Aircrafter
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Aircrafter
<Sumica> 00,10ah ok
<Ponies47> Bye Aircrafter
<XAX> Shizuka: Did you eventually find it?
<Shizuka> 13not yet
<Sumica> 00,10I just got past the pointless room full of big boxes
<Shizuka> 13got the other four experiments though
<Sumica> 00,10the one that used to have a bottmless pit
<XAX> Shizuka: Yeah, I got 4 without trying really. I'll be going back through the game on hard soon for dat challenge, so I'll have a good look then.
<Sumica> 00,10and yes that is Mal from Firefly
<Kandarihu> I'm stuck on the end of Blasting Pit
<pony_6518> dam felecia day can do everything
<Shizuka> 13unless the last eperiment is cryonics, but not sure what you should do there other than purge once to set the brutes free, then again to kill them and the soldiers
<XAX> Kandarihu: :o Blast Pit ain't thaaaaaat hard.
<Shizuka> 13the tentacles in blast pit are a bit tone deaf after you get back from one of the generators, they don't seem to react to grenades as much
<Shizuka> 13you just have to try to dodge them
<XAX> They're easier to dodge in BM:S than in HL1.
<Kandarihu> They hurt me even if they come anywhere near me.
<XAX> In HL1, you let go of shift for a second and they're right in your face slamming their noses into you 5 times a second.
<Sumica> 00,10they have to be seeing as gorden is now 6 feet wide and weighs 450lbs
<Shizuka> 13isn't it obvious
<Shizuka> 13gaben freeman
<Sumica> 00,10hahah
<Sumica> 00,10but wait gaben still has his ponytail
<Shizuka> 13sellout...
<Sumica> 00,10heheh
<XAX> Gaben isn't a sellout.
<Shizuka> 13i love all the lampshades in the first chapter
<Sumica> 00,10so is it bad the first thing i did is hit the fire alarm 5 times
<Shizuka> 13and the post resonance cascade level... gave me chills
<XAX> He didn't sell Valve to EA when they offered.
<XAX> Shizuka: dat elevator ;_;
<Kandarihu> They cause moderate damage from indirect impact and darn near lethal damage from direct impact.
<Sumica> 00,10then throw trashcans at every one
<Shizuka> 13i felt bad after pushing the alarm once cause the barney actually got chewed out for it
<Shizuka> 13old barney just sat there and glared at you
<Shizuka> 13it's a shock, NPCs that actually have personality
<XAX> Shizuka: The 8 years was worth the weight.
<Shizuka> 13and the banter, i love that there's banter and interactions with NPC followers, even the barneys and scientists took up resting positions when i had to leave them behind at the elevator shaft
<Sumica> 00,10did you catch the bit where the guy lost a bet cause you showed up for work Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13jaja and then he's suddenly "busy" with a flat panel on the supercomputer
<Kandarihu> XAX, worth the weight, lol
<Sumica> 00,10if you walk away and then come back the guys like I am so geting a piza for lunch
<Sumica> 00,10then the guy that lost the bet mutters somthings
<Sumica> 00,10they have a few of them
<Shizuka> 13the subtitles for gman arguing with a guy in the office are great
<Sumica> 00,10I forgot to turn my subs on
<XAX> I loved the bit where you go through one of the portals in Lambda and the scientists recognize you from Anomalous Materials, but the guard says "Shucks. I thought you were the pizza guy".
<Shizuka> 13indecipherable muttering... incomprehensible blabbering...
<Sumica> 00,10but then again I was also busy playing stack the trashcans on the guys head
<Shizuka> 13it starts out repeating the same sub that you can't hear them but then it starts getting silly
<Kandarihu> How much of this are new to this version of the game?
<Sumica> 00,10I took a screen shot of it
<Sumica> 00,10I had like 6 cans on the guys head
<XAX> lol...
<Sumica> 00,10then I procided to try and throw trash in to them
<doughnutjoe> Sumica its kinda like megamind?
<XAX> Are there stream?
<Shizuka> 13i heard a few sound effects from riven scattered around
<AdamTheDuck> XAX, yeah there's a stream.
<Shizuka> 13though i'm sure it's just a common effects library
<XAX> No YouTube linking for me, then.
<Shizuka> 13i love hearing sounds get reused, at least when it's not doom doors or the generic growls of doom mobs
<Shizuka> 13like the er'cana platform in uru being used as the drawbridges in l4d2
<Sumica> 00,10they should totaly make HL2 in sorce next they can call it black mesa 2
<AdamTheDuck> I don't know why but I can never take Gabe Newell seriously now that I've seen this: http://derpy.me/vxSFM
<Phase4> 00,02oh i c
<Shizuka> 13imma say it, black mesa puts episode 2 to shame
<Phase4> 00,02this is that thing
<Phase4> 00,02neat ^_^
<Sumica> 00,10yep Phase4
<Shizuka> 13episode 2 has nice big outdoors environments.... which you zoom through at 50 miles an hour in a car
<Shizuka> 13that and the endless endless antlion tunnels
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, wat
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<Buytoast> goddamn antlions
<Sumica> 00,10i will forever say fuck ep2
<Sumica> 00,10first off cause *spoiler*
<Kandarihu> I see. This song is from HERE, and THAT is the meaning of the lyrics "show that horse"
<Sumica> 00,10secondly cause i took that fucking gnome all the way through the game and forgot to close the hatch
<Shizuka> 13eli getting the bridge dropped on him.. and sure it makes sense for that point in the plotline, but still
<Shizuka> 13for it to just end there with no resolution in the forseeable future
<AdamTheDuck> I'm sorry Phase4, but I cannot explain what is happening in that picture.
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, i'm not sure anyone can
<AdamTheDuck> I just... I don't even.
<Kandarihu> "It's a good day to be homeless" *shudders*
<Shizuka> 13black mesa actually makes it feel like you're a random theoretical physicist fighting for his life, half life 2 makes you out to be god who just happens to know science
<AdamTheDuck> For science!`
<AdamTheDuck> Killing zombie headcrabs, for science!~
<Sumica> 00,10the one free man
<Dumorimasoddaa> Shizuka tbh after the events of hl1 you are kindo a god in the eyes of some
<Sumica> 00,10makes you wonder how any one even knows of gorden
<sub06905> dat pillow :D
<Shizuka> 13and apart from being the one guy who makes it through a TOP SECRET UNDERGROUND FACILITY
<Shizuka> 13how does anyone know who freeman is... seriously
<Sumica> 00,10well to be fair in HL1 I was a god.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, i'd say its because he killed a lot of people but basically anyone who saw him died so...
<XAX> Shizuka: On a completely unrelated note, top comment on a half life 2 speedrun. "Spends his time before combine invasion studying physics. Spends his time after combine invasion breaking physics. Gordan Freeman ladies and gentlemen."
<Shizuka> 13that's the one thing black mesa is missing now that i think of it
<Ponies47> Well it's past 3:00 AM again so time for bed. Good night everypony and Sumi thanks for the stream as always :)
<sub06905> night Ponies47
<Shizuka> 13black mesa needs a breen cameo
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Ponies47
<Dumorimasoddaa> Shizuka some of the soliders survived
<Sumica> 00,10"I hate the homeless. *changes card* problem in this city"
<Dumorimasoddaa> The vorts where freed by him
<Kandarihu> A reworked Xen
<Shizuka> 13vorts might have done it
<Dumorimasoddaa> Some if the science team know the full story too
<XAX> I cannot wait for Xen. Wonder how long it'll be...
<Sumica> 00,10kinda funny to me how every one hates the jump system in blackmesa
<Dumorimasoddaa> Barny for example knows most of it
<Phase4> 00,02from what i've read, half life's story was made up as they went
<Shizuka> 13the whole combine invasion is a pretty gaping whole in the half life chronology
<Sumica> 00,10to me it's like normal
<Shizuka> 13it makes sense sure but you never see it play out in-game
<Phase4> 00,02Dumorimasoddaa, barny told everyone, problem solved
<Shizuka> 13one minute you're bumming around xen and blow up giant floating baby
<Shizuka> 13the next minute it's 1984 and combine are everywhere
<Phase4> 00,02g-man did it
<Phase4> 00,02read: magic
<Kandarihu> Well, jumping works fine for me, unless I'm trying to reach something that's higher than where I started from.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Shizuka you one got frozen on time by g-man till he needed you again
<Sumica> 00,10ever see the combine guys youtube videos Shizuka? done by the same guy that dose mind of freeman
<Phase4> 00,02i've not played through hl1 or black mesa
<Phase4> 00,02probably should
<Shizuka> 13civil protection? love those
<Kandarihu> But bridging gaps is fine for ordinary jumping
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Shizuka> 13especially the aliens one
<Shizuka> 13simba the strider
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Sumica> 00,10I might have to stream some mind of freeman
<Shizuka> 13especially especially when they whistle close encounters of the third kind at each other
<Shizuka> 13it's over like 8 hours now i think
<Sumica> 00,10sounds about right
<XAX> Shizuka: Here's how I see it. After Black Mesa, Breen somehow took control of everything and took a whole bunch of people and turned them into his army and some of the others into stalkers or whatever.
<Shizuka> 13the canon story is the combine were sitting in some third alternate dimension behind Xen, and installed Nihilanth there to keep the vorts in line
<Shizuka> 13humans blow open a rift to Xen, Nihilanth sends vorts in to do vort things, freeman comes and blows up Nihilanth but doesn't close the rift to earth
<XAX> lol.
<Shizuka> 13the combine tear through Xen and use the Black Mesa rift to open superportals elsewhere on earth, and take over in seven hours
<AdamTheDuck> Should I look away from chat because I haven't played hl2 yet? :<
<my> oh noes did i miss season 3 episode 1?
<XAX> Ooooooooooh. 7 hour war.
<XAX> I see now.
<sub06905> my: yes you did
<Shizuka> 13breen makes a deal and becomes administrator of earth, combine stop slaughtering everyone and opt for enslavement instead
<my> sad face
<sub06905> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Maid_RainBow> my : :'(
<Shizuka> 13even then though... the combine war strategy is pretty dumb.... apart from using stalkers to build their war machines, there isn't like a line of supply back to the combine overworld
<Shizuka> 13agriculture is dead cause they drained the oceans, manufacturing is probably dead because they have the walls that eat everything
<Buytoast> so if i followed this right, neil patrick harris has the hots for some whore that jumped captain hammerass's bones?
<XAX> Reproduction was dead until Gordan shut down the thing that stopped it.
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Dr. Breen is evil though
<Sumica> 00,10more or less Buytoast
<Buytoast> oh, she's dead
<Buytoast> well than that's good
<Sumica> 00,10yeah she got hit by shrapnal
<Shizuka> 13yeah the humans would have died out entirely within 40-60 years... what exactly was the combine game plan after that?
<Sumica> 00,10his dethray got damaged and when hammer went to use it it exploded
<XAX> Shizuka: Earth all to themselves? Party.
<Ihop> downer
<Shizuka> 13the moral of the story is the combine are idiots, but we knew that, because you can fool a metrocop into not seeing you by holding a palm sized box between your eyeballs and him
<Sumica> 00,10and then the world outside portal 2 makes snece Shizuka
<XAX> Shizuka: ...really?
<Shizuka> 13yeah, i did it last time i streamed hl2 even
<XAX> I have to try that.
<Shizuka> 13that one metrocop by the floodgate, with the mounted gun at the end of a long platform with boxes to hide behind
<Shizuka> 13you just pick up a little bit of debris, hold it right in front of your face, he never shoots
<Sumica> 00,10behold, badhorse
<Shizuka> 13it seems to only work there, probably because he's on the gun, the rest of the soldiers in the game aren't usually as dumb
<sub06905> i have no idea what is going on
<Shizuka> 13or have backup so you get shot anyway
<Kandarihu> Is this how it ended?
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Ihop> yes
<Shizuka> 13but it works there because the way the metrocop determines if he can see you is it casts a ray from your eyeballs to him, and the debris blocks it
<Phase4> 00,02jed whedon?
<Sumica> 00,10whedon's are like kerbals
<Shizuka> 13anyway enough dumping core... sleep time
<Kandarihu> A relative of Joss Whedon?
<XAX> nini Shizuschlafen
<Spectrum_Rush> brother of Joss mayhaps
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Sumica> 00,10IT croud, dats a good show
<sub06905> dat tardis
<Phase4> 00,02night Shizuschlafen
<Sumica> 00,10so how about some mind.
<XAX> Speaking of mind, you can find brains on the ground in some places in the anomalous materials lab In BM.
<XAX> Among other body parts.
<Sumica> 00,10this is the only freman voice I will be ok with
<Kandarihu> Ah, Barney
<AdamTheDuck> znight Shizuschlafen
<XAX> Wish there was a way to watch stream from my iPod.
*sub06905 watches stream on ipod sometimes :$
<Spitfire1872> woah what is this
<XAX> sub06905: HOW.
<Spitfire1872> HL1?
<Sumica> 00,10Freemans Mind
<my> this guy's commentry is funny XD
<somepony_else> good morning everypony!
<Sumica> 00,10morning somepony_else
<AdamTheDuck> Morning somepony_else
<XAX> sub06905: HOWHOWHOW
<somepony_else> hey Sumica and AdamTheDuck
<Phase4> 00,02this is wierd
<sub06905> XAX: hold on
<Sumica> 00,10what is Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02this show
<Sumica> 00,10you never saw mind of freman?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, nope
<XAX> that blistering reply speed
<sub06905> XAX: get the app Photon Flash Video Player, may i say that sometimes it takes awhile to get app to work
<Kandarihu> Interesting to see what it originally was like
<XAX> sub06905: Danke.
<sub06905> XAX: also its $3.99
<sub06905> :3
<Sumica> 00,10this is not quite it Kandarihu
<Sumica> 00,10this is the remake one
<Kandarihu> HL:S?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<AdamTheDuck> Source?
<Kandarihu> I see
<XAX> sub06905: do you even jailbreak
<Sumica> 00,10but it's mostly cosmedic
<Maid_RainBow> Sumica : is this on youtube?
<AdamTheDuck> Doesn't look that different from original to me >.<
<sub06905> XAX: never said i payed for it <.<
<Sumica> 00,10yeah but I am not playing it from youtube
<Sumica> 00,10it looks better AdamTheDuck
<Sumica> 00,10love this song
<AdamTheDuck> But then again I haven't played Half Life in a while
<Maid_RainBow> Sumica : can you play the intro of the new WOW Mist of Pandora?
<sub06905> dat song
<Buytoast> the mists of pandaria intro is dissapointing
<my> i didnt think so
<Buytoast> the first half is pretty nice
<Buytoast> but then it turns into kung fu panda
<Buytoast> and not just because there's a panda
<Maid_RainBow> Buytoast : i find it funny because it has a bit of Kung fu panda feel to it
<Maid_RainBow> lol
<my> i know XD
<Buytoast> i just find it dissapointing that it goes from the survival grabbag free for all into a light hearted whimsical panda smackdown
<Phase4> 00,02lol, those old processors
<sub06905> lol
<Phase4> 00,02i had a cyrix
<Phase4> 00,02worked ok
<my> XD
<Sumica> 00,10tended to explode
<Phase4> 00,02i didnt use it for long
<Sumica> 00,10Gorden is best disgruntled scientist
<XAX> Gorden Frooman
<Phase4> 00,02>disprove string theory
<my> impossible
<Phase4> 00,02that would be neat, string theory isnt exactly being usefull
<XAX> Phase4: Sum up string theory please.
<krazy> ooh, freemans mind!
<Tervicz> This Gorden sounds like Homer Simpson
<Sumica> 00,103 strings and some twigs and you can make a bow
<my> :$
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, http://xkcd.com/171/
<my> was he teleporting or shifting dimensions/
<XAX> Phase4: Awesome.
<Kandarihu> Oh no, I must've missed one

<Dark_Horst> yes
<ModernSuperMASF123U> But do you need to buy Half-Life 2?
<ModernSuperMASF123U> :P
<Sumica> 00,10just need some bits of sorce

<my> i cant find episode 1 anywhere
<Sumica> 00,10of?
<my> s3
<Sumica> 00,10because it's not out
<XAX> Not out yet.
<my> i heard it was out yesterday
<AdamTheDuck> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<krazy> Somebody told me it omes out on the 24th, I dont belive them
<AdamTheDuck> Nope
<Sumica> 00,10you were lied to
<my> i heard it came ou on the 15th
<AdamTheDuck> Lies :<
<my> out*
<Sumica> 00,1024th is a monday
<seatsea> Between 20 an 23rd
<XAX> Lies and slander.
<krazy> oh yeah good point
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Speaking of 24, that's close to the number 25.
<seatsea> Yes and
<Sumica> 00,10the hell you say
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,0225 represents the number of GBs that Wii U discs can store up to \:3/
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Where is BerryPunch? D:
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02GB = Gigabytes... not Game Boys >>
<ModernSuperMASF123U> Oh hi NewSuperBronyU, I got an upgrade from AJIsAwesome|Asleep
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02ModernSuperMASF123U: Awesome :D
<XAX> http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/397/538/be6.jpg
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02XAX: Oh God...I don't think I could be crazy enough to rest my head on that...
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, ah, so its blu-ray
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Phase4: Not Blu-ray
<Phase4> 00,02its blu-ray :P
<Buytoast> Oh sweet sweet gaben. I'm glad you're watching over my dreams
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,025x the transfer rate of Blu-Ray :)
<Phase4> 00,02they'll be doing the same thing they do on the wii
<Buytoast> you make me such a heavy sleeper
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02So, it's better than Blu-Ray :3
<Phase4> 00,02ALLMOST identical disk, custom drive
<XAX> NewSuperBronyU: Who wouldn't want a gaben pillow?
<Sumica> 00,10so it's a blueray with extra buffer time
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02It's a custom form of DVD...probably HD-DVD in a new form >>
<Buytoast> goddamn geldon fordmun kills alot of people
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, it will be very near blu-ray because thats whats cheap to produce
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02HD-DVD was cheaper to produce than Blu-Ray
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Nintendo confirmed it wasn't Blu-Ray
<Sumica> 00,10of corse they did, cause sony owns blu ray
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Indeed, but they're not going to be dumb to use Blu-Ray and force users to install games just to go up to the same transfer speeds as that of DVD.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah they had to go with faster speeds to make up for the lack of diskspace
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02However, it's 16x that of DVDs and 5x that of Blu-Ray, so it's a superior proprietary medium that's closely related to the architecture of DVD
<MaxTheBrony> Good morning :)
<audiosurferbrony> So that everyone knows I am using a chat client on my phone so I can't see the stream
<AdamTheDuck> Morning to you MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> Heya AdamTheDuck :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You can plug any drive you want into the Wii U and it will work Sumica.
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, i do know its not hd-dvd, those disks had a higher cost to store 25GB than blu-ray and the drives were slower
<somepony_else> good morning MaxTheBrony and audiosurferbrony
<MaxTheBrony> hi somepony_else :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Then it's something new with DVDs they are using because it isn't Blu-Ray.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02It's much faster than Blu-Ray
<Phase4> 00,02the only benefit that hd-dvd really had over blu-ray was reuse of the old dvd infastructure with nearly zero modification
<Phase4> 00,02big quotation marks around the 'nearly'
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, if it actually is a custom disk then neat but it'll increase game cost
<Sumica> 00,10the controllers cost 150+ I dont think they care of cost.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Phase4: Maybe so, but it will give the high capacity drives that Blu-ray has while speeding up transfer speeds so you don't have to install games for it to load normally.
<AdamTheDuck> $150 for a controller? o.o
<krazy> ^^
<Spectrum_Rush> so much blue
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02ikr
<my> i mean if they didnt supply the 3DSXl with a charger they proboly arnt going to su-pply the game with a controller
<my> console*
<AdamTheDuck> Ah gravity, thy hearthless bitch.
<krazy> wow, really? thats stupid
<AdamTheDuck> I take it back, this looks alot better than original half life :3
<Sumica> 00,10hehe
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodmorning people :)
<AdamTheDuck> Morning MLP_Brovakiin
<krazy> I remember the first time a watched this....
<d3rb> morning MLP_Brovakiin
<krazy> mornin'
<Sumica> 00,10again this is the only voice I will be happy with for freman
<my> this commentater sounds like mlp michel from rooster teeth
<AdamTheDuck> Does Gorden ever speak through the Half Life games?
<d3rb> nope
<AdamTheDuck> Gordon*
<Phase4> 00,02PHYSICS
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Moo o.o
<Sumica> 00,10the box motion?
<my> extreme hotscotch
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah
<Phase4> 00,02doesnt look scripted but it could be
<Sumica> 00,10it's HL:S
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<krazy> I have a question. what does black measa have to do with apreture?
<Sumica> 00,10rival companys
<Buytoast> competitors
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Phase4> 00,02what is it with people and thinkign you can light the atmosphere on fire
<AdamTheDuck> "I don't want to set the world onnn fiirrreeeee"~
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^bacause it is made of paper and cheetos
<Dark_Horst> take enough heat and everything will burn
<Sumica> 00,10cause o2 burns
<MLP_Brovakiin> *because
<Jmo> I dunno about the atmosphere, but I'm sure I can lgiht you on fire Phase.
<Jmo> light*
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, not everything burns, and theres a difference betwene raw combustion and a sustained fire
<Phase4> 00,02Jmo, o_O
<Dark_Horst> well, at elast the atmosphere has oxygen
<Jmo> ;D
<AdamTheDuck> Doesn't fire require fuel as well as oxygen to burn? o.o
<Phase4> 00,02D:
<d3rb> gordon mclain
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, the idea is that the atmosphere itself becomes fuel, but these people dont get chemestry
<Jmo> dat chemistry
<Phase4> 00,02i cant spell
<Jmo> :>
<krazy> fire needs fuel oxygen and heat
<AdamTheDuck> and an ignition event :P
<Phase4> 00,02there are ways to combust without oxygen, plus a bunch of chemicals that ignite only on contact with each other
<Phase4> 00,02wiki has more info than me
<Phase4> 00,02i'd be checking wiki but gordon
<Phase4> 00,02dr newell
<krazy> ikr
<Phase4> 00,02if only you had some kind of.... prying bar
<Buytoast> he has a heavy class curriculum
<Phase4> 00,02you could open the doors
<AdamTheDuck> ^ if only if only~ :D
<Gold_Demona> Good morning Bronysta- OMG FREEMAN'S MIND!!! 8D

<AdamTheDuck> Wait... Doesn't HL:S have a beretta pistol replacer?
<AdamTheDuck> Instead of a Glock
<Phase4> 00,02Crikey
<Gold_Demona> From what I understand, they made their own models for all the HL1 weapons.
<Gold_Demona> All the ones that aren't in HL2 anyway
<Gold_Demona> I haven't played far enough in it yet to know for sure. :P
<Moopy> Hey guys i think the youtube guys did something wronge

<FlutterShy_> thank you <d3rb>
<Sumica> 00,10no luna either
<AdamTheDuck> What's this about a Buildabear survey? 6-9
<Gold_Demona> I can't play Half Life 2 anymore without thinking like this version of Freeman. The last time I played my husband and I were making snarky Freeman's Mind-esque comments everywhere. XD
<AdamTheDuck> 6_9 *
<FlutterShy_> oh it is wonderful Gold Demona it's not like most Brony websites -__-
<Phase4> 00,02"
<Phase4> 00,02Build-A-Bear Workshop could have My Little Pony characters at our stores, including Spike the Dragon. Or, we could have the dragon and unicorn shown above. Which do you think your child would be most likely to ask for, if any?"
<Sumica> 00,10now link the image of the unicorn
<Sumica> 00,10it looks like a g3
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.buildabearsurveys.com/surveys/542885338/1e08cebaimg090.JPG
<applejack`> 05filetype jpg/image
<Phase4> 00,02also their spike alternative: http://www.buildabearsurveys.com/surveys/542885338/1e08cebaimg089.JPG
<Dark_Horst> ...they even ask that?
<AdamTheDuck> :< wat
<d3rb> da fuq
<Dark_Horst> good lord,t hat is hidous
<Phase4> 00,02lolololo applejack
<Sumica> 00,10yeah Dark_Horst
<d3rb> how hard is it to get the g4 look...really
<Sumica> 00,10no d3rb, that's the one they they can do.
<FlutterShy_> Does anyone know where Rainbow Dash is?
<Phase4> 00,02gordon is ninja spai
<d3rb> well they should try harder
<d3rb> g4 or not that thing sucks
<Sumica> 00,10they are wndering if they can get away with out having to pay for the lisence
<AdamTheDuck> Spike alternative? What does their original Spike look like?
<Gold_Demona> I imagine they'll get the G4 look is they actually decide to add FiM toys. Which shouldn't be a hard decision with all the bronies doing the survey. :P
<Gold_Demona> if*
<FlutterShy_> is no one gonna answer :(
<Sumica> 00,10they can get the rights to make ones that look like g4
<Phase4> 00,02its gona be wierd when 18-22 year old males start flooding the workshops
<Sumica> 00,10but they would ratehr save cash
<Gold_Demona> FlutterShy_ What do you mean where Rainbow Dash is?
<krazy> FlutterShy_: what was the question?

<Sumica> 00,10remember though Barny was locked out
<Gold_Demona> Barny's busy trying to escape in his own game.

<Phase4> 00,02night NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<DaringDerpy> night NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<MLP_Brovakiin> Sleep well NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> XD
<Vordox> Dat Context change
<Klumzeedragon> Night Meany NewSuperBronyU|Zzz. :P
<ModernSuperMASF123U> NewBrony2012: see you
*ModernSuperMASF123U yawns
<ModernSuperMASF123U> I mean NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<Vordox> Nowhe is drumming!
<ModernSuperMASF123U> see you all later
<Vordox> :(
<Vordox> Seeing this makes me sad now
<d3rb> why?
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Moder- oh well
<Vordox> I was about 80% done with this game
<Vordox> But then
<Vordox> FLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASH
<Vordox> And now it is scrapped
<d3rb> damn
<Vordox> Oh Phase4
<Sumica> 00,10flash eat your vidga game?
<Klumzeedragon> Vordox: Shake your fist at it angrily and start over?
<Vordox> Nah Sumica , Sound API issues(Delayed sounds in rhythm game?)
<XAX> dat foal in one
<Sumica> 00,10ah yeah
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, send me some code?
<Sumica> 00,10figured that was gonna happen to yah
<Vordox> Phase4: Anyway, I checked up HTMl5, i still has a delay of up to 30 ms
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<Vordox> When hearing can nootice difference of 7 ms
<Vordox> Phase4: It's not code issues, it's a core issue. :P
<RoboGerbil> Vordox: you talking about an xbox?
<Vordox> No :P
<Vordox> Flash As3
<Phase4> 00,02flash cant do real time, regardless of what adobe says
<Vordox> Phase4: It can be faked...but faking sounds causes..."naeusous" :P
<Phase4> 00,02i would sugest java but i actually tried to write something in it today
<Phase4> 00,02it actively resists programing
<Vordox> Phase4: I'm looking more and more at C++ or C# :P
<Vordox> Atleast that should be quite doable with sounds, no?
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, your probably stuck with native/near native right now
<Sumica> 00,10and with this I PTFO
<Phase4> 00,02SHOO BE DOO
<Vordox> Piss the Feck Out+
<RoboGerbil> just make lots of siezuristic colors flash by and no one will notice the horribad everything else... see any anime
<Vordox> ?
<Gold_Demona> Thanks for stream Sumi. :3
<Phase4> 00,02we need g4 seaponies
<Vordox> Or Peace the Friendship Oribit?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah we do
<Gold_Demona> Agreed Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02inb4 s3 has seaponies
<Sumica> 00,10I would love the drama of that day
<Vordox> There'll be no Sea pones :P
<Sumica> 00,10just think of the caht reactions
<Phase4> 00,02it'll be derpy all over again
<Sumica> 00,10chat*
<somepony_else> it's bacon and applejack!
<Gold_Demona> LOL Ikr? XD
<Phase4> 00,02except there will be more people
<Phase4> 00,02so more spam
<Sumica> 00,10night all
<Gold_Demona> bye sumi
<AdamTheDuck> Night Sumica
<somepony_else> good night sumica
<Phase4> 00,02night Sumica
<DaringDerpy> bye Sumica
<Vordox> Night Sumica
<d3rb> night Sumica
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Sumica
<Vordox> I wonder....
<Vordox> I'm gonna check GML langage
<Vordox> See the sound latency on it
<Malavolent> Ello
<Malavolent> Ello there everybrony.
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Malavolent
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Malavolent
*Gold_Demona has seaponies stuck in her head.
<Vordox> Phase4: If Game Maker has good loading of sound...
<Vordox> I should've grabbed it first
<Vordox> But I don't know how it handles Vector graphics of Mysterbyben
<Phase4> 00,02i wouldnt trust game maker
<AdamTheDuck> Yay wakeup call :D
<Vordox> Phase4: Why not?
<Phase4> 00,02never liked those kinda things
<Phase4> 00,02with purpose built languages
<Vordox> Phase4: It's where I started my prototyping
<Vordox> :P
<Vordox> And I still use it today
<Vordox> Haven't stopped me in my tracks yet(I only stop when I have to stop or build around)
<Phase4> 00,02for prototyping sure
<Vordox> ALSOOOO!
<Phase4> 00,02but a full game?
<Vordox> Phase4: It has Sounds being put in memory for instant call back
<Vordox> Phase4: Ther'es plenty :P
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> Dem faces with the song
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, you only really have one sound though
<Vordox> Phase4: One Sound?
<Phase4> 00,02the song
<Vordox> Oh no
<Phase4> 00,02just need to keep animations in sync
<Vordox> There's more then song
<Phase4> 00,02patcher is broke still
<Vordox> I'm making a fully coded game
<Vordox> There's at top 5 sounds at one time
<Vordox> (Which Flash fails miserably per each added instance)
<Phase4> 00,02why so many?
<Vordox> It's a game :P
<Vordox> Like SweetieBell's Ooo, the sinw gsound, the hit/miss sound of the Club and the Ball Flying sound
<Vordox> swing sound*
<Vordox> Flash can handle itself on ONE song...
<Vordox> If in main Timeline, otherwise.. Coding to start sounds = bad
<Vordox> Phase4: We need more music!
<Vordox> Put on endurance? :D
<Phase4> 00,02this is broken
<AdamTheDuck> broken :<
<Phase4> 00,02i cant do 4x symetry on the wings
<Phase4> 00,02which is disapointing
<Phase4> 00,02i want to build this plane :(
<Vordox> Too complex for emulator :P
<Vordox> I wonder Phase4, what do you mean by native code?
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, compiles to machine code
<Vordox> Ah
<Vordox> Basically, messing around with the software/Hardware itself
<Phase4> 00,02well no, it runs in userspace
<Phase4> 00,02so no hardware access
<Vordox> Aww.
<Vordox> It should help with the sound latency right?
<Phase4> 00,02well you get access to the native audio api's
<Phase4> 00,02which have either much lower latency or latency controll
<Vordox> Depending of if I can store the sound files into memory
<Vordox> That's one of the solutions, I just go to know HOW to do it
<Vordox> The callback from internal machine code should be quick as heck.
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, you can get them into memory easy, infact firefox does that, the 30ms is coming from elsewhere
<Vordox> Hmmm
<Vordox> Great, more digging! :P
<Vordox> But Phase4 , I'm thinking of it being actually played on the machine itself
<Vordox> Not played through a server/Proxy
<AdamTheDuck> Boom :P
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, theres no server/proxy when running stuff in javascript
<Vordox> But I can't do java.
<Vordox> One of the languages I have yet not even drilled into
<Vordox> But I think stand alone sounds better imo then run through a website, Better and faster(I assume atleast) For quality gaming
<Vordox> And hey, if it's a good system it might be warranted to be increased as well :P
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, the thing about html5 though is zero barrier, you navigate to the game and it works
<Phase4> 00,02i added more rocket
<Phase4> 00,02this might work now
<Vordox> Phase4: Inb4 Short flight
<Vordox> Phase4: Yeah but the Sound API of HTML5 still causes a delay of up to 30
<Vordox> While aiming for 7ms is the most ideal, or less
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, where did you get the 30ms number?
<Vordox> http://cromwellian.blogspot.se/2011/05/ive-been-having-twitter-back-and-forth.html <-- One of the sites, let me find the other
<Phase4> 00,02lets play readalong!
<Phase4> 00,02also i read fast
<Vordox> EDUCATION BOYS
<Vordox> (And girls9
<AdamTheDuck> Yay I can feel myself being edumacated
<Vordox> XD AdamTheDuck
<Gold_Demona> My brains! They creak! D:
<Gold_Demona> Like an old rusted machine that hasn't been used in a very very long time!
<Phase4> 00,02this seems complete enough
<Vordox> Gold_Demona: That long, eh
<Gold_Demona> Vordox: Yes, my poor poor unused brain. D:
<Gold_Demona> Very neglected
<Vordox> Gold_Demona: Quick, watch more ponies
<Gold_Demona> I know! I'll watch Lesson Zero and see how Twilight uses her brains! :D
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Phase4> 00,02i see
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, so this stuff isnt implimented
<Phase4> 00,02but it is the api you need for real time audio
<alexxm> hey guys
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo alexxm
<Vordox> Oh!
<Vordox> Link please.
<alexxm> how are things Gold_Demona
<Vordox> Is this the part of the HTMl5?
<Vordox> Or you reading Java?
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/
<Phase4> 00,02html5
<Gold_Demona> Pretty well, alexxm. Thanks for asking. And yourself?
<Phase4> 00,02this rocket needs more wing
<AdamTheDuck> Hello alexxm
<Gold_Demona> It needs more cowbell
<Vordox> Phase4: It says Javascript at the top. <.<
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, yes.... javascript is part of html5
<alexxm> hey AdamTheDuck
<Vordox> Phase4: Oh...
<Vordox> So it's double language hybrid
<Klumzeedragon> Goodnight everypony. :) Thanks for the stream Phase4.
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, html5 is not a language :P
<Phase4> 00,02it a set of standards that happen to include javascript
<Vordox> I thought it was :P
<Phase4> 00,02night Klumzeedragon
<Vordox> Just like Flash was AS3(With Java mixed in)
<Funkballs> heh is that a Phase4 OC coding and building rockets there?
<AdamTheDuck> Night Klumzeedragon
<Phase4> 00,02eyup
<Vordox> Something exploded
<Funkballs> lol awesome
<Vordox> "noone cares"
<Phase4> 00,02staging fail
*Klumzeedragon licks AdamTheDuck before scittering off
<Vordox> Funkballs: Check the thing he is watching
<Vordox> It's US
<Vordox> RIGHT NOW
*AdamTheDuck has been licked "Yay" :3
<Funkballs> lol he's checking irc?
<alexxm> so any succesful missions today
<adasdad> pulled up too hard lol
<AdamTheDuck> Haha :D
<adasdad> need some vertical flexibility
<Vordox> Phase4: This is alot to read...
<Vordox> brb
<adasdad> or an elevated runway, at the very least
<Vordox> Let's see if I understand 1% of it
<adasdad> yay~
<adasdad> boo~
<AdamTheDuck> front flip :P
<Phase4> 00,02the problem is my computer cant handle rocket of this magnitude
<adasdad> that sounds like an anime quote
<AdamTheDuck> Dat lag lol, thought it was just my stream lagging
<Vordox> Phase4: So it seems that HTMl5 can be close to real time as possible, while still being in a browser?
<adasdad> MY COMPUTER CANNOT HANDLE A ROCKET OIF THIS MAGINITUDE
<adasdad> see
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, it can be realtime, all browsers these days have incredible javascript engines
<Phase4> 00,02full on 70% native speed jits and everything
<Vordox> Phase4: Explains why Java is the leader atm.
<Phase4> 00,02java o_O
*AdamTheDuck pretends to know what's going on 6_9
<adasdad> just for lulz, you should make a rocket shaped like the space core.
<Vordox> Java has some of the more powerful coding attributes, doesn't it
<Vordox> ?
<Phase4> 00,02javascript > java
<adasdad> uh oh...
<Vordox> Javascripts are made in Java? <.<
<adasdad> c'mon, rise....
<adasdad> ffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
<AdamTheDuck> Yay explosions
<Vordox> HE LIVED
<adasdad> i like how it came out of lag just to frop to the ground
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, javascript and java have nothing to do with each other
<Vordox> ded
<AdamTheDuck> Nope :D
<AdamTheDuck> deds
<Phase4> 00,02the name is because of this buisness deal that happend betwene sun and netscape some years ago
<adasdad> UUUULTRA ded
<alexxm> i thought it was 3 kerbals in this game
<Vordox> Oh.
<Vordox> No wonder the confusion ><
<Phase4> 00,02the intent was javascript would be 'training wheels' for java
<Vordox> >.>
<Vordox> LAWL
<Vordox> This outcome
<Phase4> 00,02which is all well and good, except javascript is BETTER and MORE POWERFULL than java
<adasdad> vordox, how long can you go before pulling up? it might be better to just gradually lift out of the atmosphere.
<Vordox> I'm not the one driving the game
<Vordox> It's Phase :D
<Phase4> 00,02adasdad, i'm flying :P
<adasdad> fail
<Vordox> Yeah I'm laughing at the outcome of how it was meant to be, Phase4
<adasdad> i knew that, but my brain didn't :p
<Vordox> Phase4: Well that makes it easier to understand thanks.
<Gold_Demona> Silly brains. :P
<adasdad> too much lag, it hurts my eyes 3:
<MadSurge> Good morning Bronystate! :D
<Vordox> Phase4: Oh friends wanna play some games. I'll poke you later if I get into more information, Phase4 =3 Thanks alot
<Phase4> 00,02^_^
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Vordox
<MadSurge> Hey Gold_Demona :$
<alexxm> how are things MadSurge
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo MadSurge. =D
<AdamTheDuck> Hello MadSurge
<Vordox> AdamTheDuck: I'll still be here
<Vordox> In case anyone wants me(HAHAHAHAH WHO WOULD?! Hahaha...hah...)
*AdamTheDuck gives Vordox a lick o.o
<Vordox> AdamTheDuck: Eww much?
<AdamTheDuck> :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: are the Survival-Hard levels hard in Plants vs Zombies? :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: They can be. I eventually managed to beat all of them, though.
*alexxm kidnaps AdamTheDuck
*AdamTheDuck escapes and runs into alexxm's cage for time sake :3
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Two rows of sun-making plants, a row of magnet-shrooms and a line of pumpkined Tallnuts always help :D
<Phase4> 00,02wait a minute
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Definitely. Having pumpkined everything else also helps.
<Phase4> 00,02if i launch from the spaceplane hanger
<Phase4> 00,02i dont have the tower to worry about
<Phase4> 00,02BIGGER ROCKETS!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: In the survival levels, I like to pumpkin EVERYTHING
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Also upgraded spikeweeds
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: still haven't reached that need
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: And cattails the pool levels
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I LOVE cattails
<AdamTheDuck> I saw bigger rockets, will that mean bigger explosions Phase4? :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: they're expensive, but they're worth it
<MadSurge> Cattails are awesome! WOOF
<AdamTheDuck> inb4 explosions yay
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: The trick with the survival levels though, is that the upgrades cost more and more, the more of them you have. :C
<AdamTheDuck> and he lives...
<Gold_Demona> The Kerbal survived? D:
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Well I got to 9990 sun in the first hard survival level :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That's good. XD
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: got the "sunny days" achievement
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: hee hee hee
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also the wisdom tree is growing only in height now
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: In the later levels, when you have SO much sun, it's okay to replace one of the rows of flowers with some artillery. :P
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: You get it to a hundred feet yet?
<Wrek> 05yay my guild has its 2 year anniversary today x3
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: only thing I can buy now is Wisdom tree food and the rake :D no, it's lije 56 feet
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Wrek
<MadSurge> *like
<AdamTheDuck> What guild?
<MadSurge> Hooray, Wrek!
<Wrek> 05wow guild
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Wrek
<Wrek> 05hi Gold_Demona!
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Wrek
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Always buy the rake whenever you can. :3
<MadSurge> WUT
<AdamTheDuck> Lolwut :D
<Gold_Demona> LOL Wut was that? XD
<MadSurge> AND HE LIVED
<AdamTheDuck> How is he ALIVE?!?
<Gold_Demona> OMG And he's happy
<Gold_Demona> He's like "AGAIN!!!"
<Phase4> 00,02stupid uncontrollable rocket
<AdamTheDuck> Yay imminent boom incoming
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, lost one of my control surfaces
<Phase4> 00,02that tends to cause problems
<Gold_Demona> The Kerbal's going nuts. XD
<Gold_Demona> And ded
<Phase4> 00,02i dont blame him
<alexxm> well this kerbal seems happy
<Phase4> 00,02oh damn
<Phase4> 00,02should have waited
<GilDash|Reading> Holla everypony! :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello GilDash|Reading
<MadSurge> Hi GilDash|Reading! :)
<Phase4> 00,02brb
<Phase4> 00,02for now enjoy munar orbit
<alexxm> how are things GilDash|Reading
<Phase4> 00,02quiet in here
<Wrek> 05yeh
<AdamTheDuck> it is
<Emil> Ooh!
<Emil> Space Science!
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Emil
<Emil> Hello AdamTheDuck!
<Emil> How is everyone?
<AdamTheDuck> Chat is 'really' quiet now :S
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Avast
<Emil> : O
<Emil> Wait, this song.
<Emil> The party music?
<AdamTheDuck> CCC theme
<Emil> Oh.
<AdamTheDuck> CMC*
<Emil> Remixed?
<Phase4> 00,02D:
<Emil> ded
<Phase4> 00,02TIME WARP Y U FAIL ME
<AdamTheDuck> Kazoos :3
<Emil> Well...
<Phase4> 00,02and it was going so well
<Emil> Is it just me, or is his design getting more and more complicated?
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02one more?
<Phase4> 00,02Emil, well my simple ones work
<Emil> Phase4: What do you mean simple?
<AdamTheDuck> Emil, if complicated means adding bigger rockets, then yes.
<Emil> AdamTheDuck: I meant more sophisticated design with new interesting aspect, unfamiliar to me.
<Emil> AdamTheDuck: But bigger rockets also work :)
<AdamTheDuck> Why so much Sellyme? 6_9
<Emil> *aspects
<AdamTheDuck> And if that don't work, use more rocket.
<Emil> Yep.
<Emil> If it doesn't work, blow it up!
<Emil> The MythBusters way.
<AdamTheDuck> If it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing~
<Emil> Exactly.
<AdamTheDuck> Oh God, so many rockets :D
<Gold_Demona> If it doesn't work the way the myth claims, then you declare it busted and keep upping the ante until you get the desired result.
<Gold_Demona> And then you keep going until something awesome happens. XD
<Emil> Gold_Demona: Which usually is a giant explosion.
<Gold_Demona> Emil: .....True. :D
<Gold_Demona> Favorite explosion is cement truck.
<Emil> Gold_Demona: I mean, who doesn't like giant f***ing explosions in the name of science, right?
<Gold_Demona> Emil: Ikr?
<Phase4> 00,02why does my music keep breaking
<AdamTheDuck> But what about the diamond explosive compression episode? :<
<Emil> AdamTheDuck: That was cool.
<Emil> How much TNT was it again?
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: That must've been a later episode. I don't remember that at all.
<AdamTheDuck> More than the cement truck one iirc xD
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Phase4> 00,02same rocket
<Phase4> 00,02but with more rocket
<Emil> lol
<Gold_Demona> I stopped having cable years ago.
<AdamTheDuck> Just with more rocket xD
<Emil> You're doing it right!
<Emil> Did something just break?
<AdamTheDuck> Appropriate music is appropriate
<Emil> lol
<Emil> Awesome music.
<Pink3Phone> hi
<Emil> Pink3Phone: Hello!
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Pink3Phone
<Pink3Phone> sorry _my_spacebar_doesnt_work
<Emil> That's weird.
<Pink3Phone> ikr
<Pink3Phone> it works om everything else
<Phase4> 00,02ok....
<Emil> How did you make that space, though?
<Phase4> 00,02i just got dc'd from irc for no aparent reason
<alexxm> how are things Pink3Phone
<Phase4> 00,02also i'm on impact course with mun
<Pink3Phone> great alexxm
<Emil> Phase4: :O
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Italian tv is shitty, we need cable to get decent stuff :D
<AdamTheDuck> Yay impact!
<Pink3Phone> is it just me or is the stream dead
<AdamTheDuck> Pink3Phone, nope ,stream is up
<Ninjazz> Hello, everyone.
<Ninjazz> Dis Phasestream.
<Ninjazz> Also dat Acoustic Brony.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Ninjazz
<Pink3Phone> ok i had 2 refresh it
<Emil> Ninjazz: Hello!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: You're in Italy? At least you guys get all the Lupin! We're screwed in that department. :C
<Pink3Phone> is this game free^
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: :D didn't I tell you already>
<AdamTheDuck> Pink3Phone, it's $15 I think, not too sure though,
<AdamTheDuck> there's a demo though
<Gold_Demona> MadSUrge: If you have, I've forgotten. I'm very good at forgetting things. 6_9
<AdamTheDuck> oh and all the outdated versions are free or something iirc
<Pink3Phone> .whatisthisgamecalled
<Gold_Demona> Kerbal Space Program
<AdamTheDuck> Message blocked due to repeating :<
<Ninjazz> If this is the Luna song, then this fits.
<Phase4> 00,02so...
<Gold_Demona> I said it first. :P
<Phase4> 00,02i'm probably gona hit the moon
<Phase4> 00,02and if i dont
<Ninjazz> Or is this the Fluttershy one?
<Phase4> 00,02its gona be hard to get back to kerbin
<AdamTheDuck> Ninjazz, Fluttershy's Ballad actually
<Ninjazz> Ah. No wonder.
<Gold_Demona> I was gonna say, sounds like "So Many Wonders"
<Ninjazz> Ty, AdamTheDuck.
<AdamTheDuck> Luna is a bit less 'peaceful'
<AdamTheDuck> Crash ftw!~
<Ninjazz> BRACE YOURSELVES.
<Gold_Demona> 8D
<Emil> Crash?
<MadSurge> Hey Ninjazz!
<Ninjazz> Ohey, MadSurge. ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02i am pro plt

<Gold_Demona> Almost made me spit my coffee, Phase4. :D
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02Success!
<Phase4> 00,02almost there
<Phase4> 00,02i'm also used to a higer resolution
<AdamTheDuck> and then chat dies again :S

<Ninjazz> Well, you know how all the RPer's kinda moved over to the other room. >_>
<Ninjazz> That's kinda part of the reason.
<Lil_B> yeah :/
<Ninjazz> Eh. I just keep all the rooms up! ^_^

<Gold_Demona> Jmo: The colors I use in my comics are all made using eyedropper tool.
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: I don't dream you cold-hearted bastard! :'(
*GilDash|Reading hugs Ninjazz.
<Jmo> Cheeaaater ;~;
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL, That'd be amazing. I don't know if I could do it, though. XP
<Ninjazz> GilDash|Reading, .......YOU. HAD. ONE. DREAM. TO. RULE. THEM. ALL.
*Ninjazz hugs GilDash|Reading back. <_<
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: goddammit Xanatos, just LOSE sometimes will ya? :D
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: Yeah, but no Spitfire. Or Braeburn. Or Rainbow Dash...
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: Doesn't help that my PC's monitor is SHIT for displaying colors.
<Dark92Enigma> AGAIN, does anypony else has it's chat rpoom space.....................reduced????? Like...................a quarter of what it used to be?
<Jmo> :P
<Ninjazz> GilDash|Reading, irrelevant and unnecessary. You were... her.
<Jmo> All them un-essential dots.
<Gold_Demona> <adSurge: LOL, IKR?
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: You and Rarity? That's like me and Spitfire, okay?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge*
<Lil_B> last year I spend way too much on a new Monitor and now I'm running it on economy mode (50% less power) all the time XD only tuen it fully on when I'm watching a movie
<Dark92Enigma> and again..................chatroom space reduced for anypony else?
<Lyncast> nope
<Lyncast> not at all :3
<Gold_Demona> I'm on a client, so no space issues here
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: for a birthday pony thing, I got to swap bodies with Rarity O__o
<Ninjazz> GilDash|Reading, bleh. I'd be fine with being anyone or anything as long as I get to see a Rarity.
<Ninjazz> Even Fluttershy.
<Ninjazz> I'd be fine being her.
<Dark92Enigma> I'm at my mim's computer.......and IT'S REDUCED TO A QUARTER
<Lyncast> Ninjazz, i think youre beautiful the way you are
<Ninjazz> Even though I dislike her.
<OtakuTom> Yea, I'm using a chat client here, too.
<Lyncast> and everypony loves you equally <3
<Dark92Enigma> Mom's*
<Lyncast> except me
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: I'd just like to dream again. Like, at all. That'd be nice.
<Lyncast> i love you moar!
<Ninjazz> Lyncast, I think you need to clean your glasses. ;_;
<Dark92Enigma> hold on, 'll refresh
<MadSurge> Dark92Enigma: maybe it's on the flash settings?
<Ninjazz> GilDash|Reading, I wish I could remember any of mine.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, lucky bastard. >_>
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: Have/remember. Same thing.
<Dark92Enigma> NOPE. for any random reason...................my chatroom space is reduced
<Lyncast> ugh, have that feeling in my chest that tells me i need a hug.
*Gold_Demona hugs Lyncast
<Gold_Demona> Better? :3
<Lyncast> thanks babe :3
<Lyncast> <3
<Ninjazz> GilDash|Reading, so we're in the same boat.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: in another, I went to the moon with Pinkamena though :D
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: No. You've still got a 1up on me. :p
<Kimori> shibaru this is my buddy
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I had one where I married Spike. >_<
<Ninjazz> GilDash|Reading, Barely.
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: Still counts. :p
*Ninjazz hugs Lyncast.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: :D you poor thing
<Ninjazz> Because hugs, gurl.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, ;_;
<Ninjazz> GilDash|Reading, ...barely.
<GilDash|Reading> Seriously, my last dream must have been in... April? And before that, probably the previous June or something.
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: Still. Counts.
<MadSurge> I never dreamt ponies :P
<Mare_Brovakiin> ^
<Ninjazz> The one I can barely remember was out of context.
<Ninjazz> I was a detective. Meeting my chief and his assistant.
<Ninjazz> My chief was my younger brother.
<Mare_Brovakiin> I haven't hada a dream that I can remember in years >.>
<Ninjazz> His assistant. Celestia.
<Ninjazz> She didn't even say anything. ;_;
<GilDash|Reading> I need to get back to learning how to lucid dream again.
<Kimori> hi
<sheep> hey
<OohShiny> no!
<Kimori> are you new here? dont think ive seen the name before
<Lyncast> rawr
<Ninjazz> Si.
<OohShiny> lucid dreaming is scary
<sheep> I've been on SF for about 4 years or something, but I haven't been very active lately.
<Ninjazz> It can be.
<Kimori> oh alright
<Ninjazz> Very much so.
<Ninjazz> But I think the gamble is worth it.
<Kimori> glad you could join here though, we are trying to revive this place
<GilDash|Reading> Bring scary on. I like to entertain scary.
<Lyncast> i love lucid dreaming
<OohShiny> you have to go through a bunch of Endermen in the hallucinations
<Lyncast> so... naughty <3
<GilDash|Reading> My imagination's strong enough as it is awake.
<OohShiny> I would lucid dream to go to Equestria though
<sheep> Yeah, I read the topic and thought to see if anyone was in here at the moment:P
<Ninjazz> My mind was only able to kickstart during math class.
<OohShiny> lol
<Ninjazz> Day dreaming was fun.
<Kimori> Just a couple of us right now
<thelonepony> it is ^
<Ninjazz> Now, I'm too relaxed to do it anymore. =_=
<GilDash|Reading> Ironically, when I "day dream", my mind actually goes completely blank. I literally do not think of anything. I have to focus to do what most would consider day dreaming.
<OohShiny> well, I don't do it in my Mechanic Materials class
<sheep> I didn't recognize your name either... how long have you been here?
<OohShiny> I usually sleep
<Kimori> 2 years I think..
<Kimori> I never joined the forums
<Ninjazz> Now all I do is think.
<alexxm> whats so scary about lucid dreaming it sounds pretty cool to me
<sheep> Oh, that explains
<OohShiny> because of the hallucinations you have to go through
<Ninjazz> alexxm, your mind is a seriously dangerous place.
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: You say you're relaxed but you think all the time? :p
<Kimori> I prefered the chat rooms
<Ninjazz> GilDash|Reading, is that impossible?
<GilDash|Reading> Meh. Hallucinations are alright if you can handle them.
<Kimori> Ive joined forums in the past and just dont really post
<OohShiny> when I'm relaxed, I think a lot
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: It's not something that tends to go hand in hand. I think all the time and I know for sure I'm not ever relaxed. XD
<Ninjazz> You see. There are other things to worry about.
<OohShiny> but I think of unnecessary things
<Ninjazz> But I think it's best that you not know about them. The less knowledge you have about them the better.
<Ninjazz> GilDash|Reading, perhaps relaxed is more equal to slow in my case.
<Ninjazz> Or... meh.
<Ninjazz> I 'unno.
<GilDash|Reading> They do say ignorance is bliss... haven't got time for ignorance though.
<GilDash|Reading> Too much to get done.
<OohShiny> wait a minute, trying to find the meaning of bliss
<OohShiny> ah, I understand
<GilDash|Reading> Happyness. Contentedness. At peace.
<GilDash|Reading> ... I swear a bird just flew onto my window.
<sheep> I rarely post, and even more rarely come and chat here
<Ninjazz> The utter opposite of peace.
<Kimori> Are you still into the spyro series?
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: Bliss is the utter opposite of peace? Funny, I would have gone with agony or something.
<MadSurge> GilDash|Reading: *splat* birds are dumb :D
<GilDash|Reading> MadSurge: It's only a pigeon. I don't like pigeons anyway.
<Ninjazz> I meant a bird hitting a window.
<Ninjazz> Hey, Nitt.
<GilDash|Reading> Ninjazz: Oh, yeah, that. XD
<GilDash|Reading> Nittany_Discord: Holla! :)
<Ponies47> Hey Nittany_Discord
<sheep> Yes. Mostly the originals. Haven't got/tried Skylanders.
<OohShiny> sup Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> Hey Ninjazz.
<Nittany_Discord> Hey GilDash|Reading and Ponies47.
<thelonepony> hi Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> And OohShiny and thelonepony.
<Ninjazz> So much greetings.
<Kimori> skylanders is ok
<GilDash|Reading> Well, it's a slow day thus far.
<Nittany_Discord> Yep.
<Kimori> its good that spyro didnt die out completely
<Adjeca> hi sheep
<sheep> But right now I'm waiting for Spyro to come to the European Playstation Store so I can play them on my psp, so I haven't played a while.
<sheep> hi
<OohShiny> it's morning, I doubt anyone would wake up just to watch the stream
<GilDash|Reading> It's almost 3 o'clock over here.
<sheep> played in a while*
<Adjeca> whenever i hear/read the word sheep i think of spyro hehe
<Ninjazz> It's Monday morning.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: shit, now they're throwing gargantuars at me! D:
<Gold_Demona> It's 10am Sunday over here
<OohShiny> Ninjazz: Where are you from??
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Oh, you mean those HUGE guys that throw tiny guys at you when their health reaches half?
<sheep> Yeah, the spyro sheep is iconic:P
<Ninjazz> OohShiny, near Japan and Guam. We use Austrailia's timezone here in Saipan.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I hate those. :<
<Mare_Brovakiin> Heya Nittany_Discord long time no see, how ya been?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yep, in survival mode
<Nittany_Discord> Surviving.
<OohShiny> MadSurge: whatcha playing?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah... They need dead fast. They take two squashes to take down.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and they even resist one hit kill plants!
<sheep> Are there sheep in skylanders?
<Kimori> yep
<Kimori> its funny too, they make a lot of comments about sheep
<MadSurge> OohShiny: Plants vs Zombies
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Squash takes them down to half.
<Kimori> the characters talk about how mysterious they are
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Tater mine is instant though, I think.
<sheep> do they still serve the same purpose?
<OohShiny> MadSurge: now that's a good TD game
<sheep> haha
<Kimori> no
<Kimori> you can still burn them though
<Kimori> ram them
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: isn't there an even worse version of them later? :(
<Kimori> but they arent for food anymore
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: No, I don't think so.
<Adjeca> hahaha
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Oh wait, yes. The berserk ones.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: They only show up in survival mode.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: woohoo :(
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: well yeah, I finished story mode :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: They're not so bad in most of the Survival mode levels because you only get like one at a time, but in the endless mode, they are your death. =/
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: at least I made it to 10 waves in I, Zombie
<Gold_Demona> I love that one. As well as the breaking pots one. =D
<Gold_Demona> I think I made it up to 20 in breaking pots once.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the breaking pots is too luck based D:
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Kinda. But if you know how to manage it, it's fun
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I always start with the right two columns so I can start putting shooters there as soon as I get 'em and not worry about the jack-in-the-box zombies.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: is the final minigame just the final boss fight?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yup
<Adjeca> the arizona sunrise this morning http://i.imgur.com/Yenhs.jpg
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It's the final boss on steroids.
<OohShiny> the final boss is fucking awesome
<Gold_Demona> I love the final boss. =)
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: oh boy, you mean winnebago attack all the time?
<Gold_Demona> I like that the final mini game is the final boss because I can fight him again without having to do story mode again. XD
<Kimori> is that smog? it looks a little hazy
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL, no, but he DOES use it more. XD
<alexxm> compeutor derped
<Adjeca> nope no smog here at all
<OohShiny> am I the only one that likes the creepy music from Flutterex?
<Gold_Demona> Never heard it. :P
<Adjeca> does look a little blurry though
<sheep> what makes it blurry?
<Kimori> could be out of focus?
<Adjeca> that's probably it
<MadSurge> Are the other Pop'n'Cap games fun to play?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Peggle. I love Peggle
<IshSexiestPony> ohai pony pepple
<MadSurge> What's that?
<Gold_Demona> Do you know how Plinko works?
<Ninjazz> Ohey, Ish.
<Ninjazz> Gold_Demona, Peggle is fun.
<IshSexiestPony> so who won the lottery?
<Ninjazz> I didn't. :c
<Ninjazz> But... Hmmm.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it looks like a weird pachinko thing
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It is, but the object is to use the ball to get rid of all the pegs.
<alexxm> is that the thing from the price is right
<killerpony7733> Did anyone catch who won then?
<Gold_Demona> And instead of dropping the ball, you shoot it out of a cannon.
<IshSexiestPony> anyone, anyone at all?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Peggle was my favorite PopCap game before Plants Vs Zombies came out
<Ninjazz> Erm. I just remember the movies.
<Gold_Demona> Especially Peggle Nights
<Ninjazz> Space Jam.
<Ninjazz> Is the B.
<IshSexiestPony> Ninjazz and teh A
<Ninjazz> ...I was too tired to remember. -_-
<Ninjazz> Trying to remember... >_<
<OohShiny> Space Jam?
<IshSexiestPony> :(
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: well, good thing there's a sequel coming eh?
<OohShiny> wee, Looney Tunes!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: There is? :O
<Ninjazz> I would go open the log, but I'm afraid it might break.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yeah totally, Plants vs Zombies 2
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Eee! Awesome! :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yesh :$

*Nife grabs the chat and shakes it.
<prince-dari> I know where nightseas is
<Kimori> He was here 4 days ago..I think
<DerpyMuffins> Once chat dies it takes alot to get it back
<Kimori> Where? on that pokemon server?
*MLP_Brovakiin defibrillates the chat
<prince-dari> One of the two, most likely her own
<prince-dari> Although she's probably on both
<DerpyMuffins> Still ded
<Kimori> oh she?
<prince-dari> IIRC
<Kimori> do you go there?
*alexxm revives the chat with stripping
<prince-dari> Used to
<AJIsAwesome> Pretty good, MLP_Brovakiin! :)
<Kimori> hmm....
<prince-dari> Not so much any more
<Kimori> I might try going to that pokemon server and see if shes there later today
<MLP_Brovakiin> Thats good to hear AJIsAwesome :)
<Bronysith> and now i join Wrek and Sumica
<Saturn> 08,01so... who's heard about this "Mohammad Movie"
<Cades> alright
*AJIsAwesome hhugs Gold_Demona Derpy_Hooves thelonepony and MLP_Brovakiin :)
<Jmo> LOLJUBILIFE~
<AJIsAwesome> Movie?
*Bronysith glomps Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i just watched half of it
<MLP_Brovakiin> alexxm: That didn't help, now put your clothes back on :P
<DerpyMuffins> DerpyMuffins......
<GilDash|Reading> You mean the one responsible for all of the embassy attacks?
<Gold_Demona> LOL JMO
<DerpyMuffins> Not hooves
<Jmo> wub it <3
<Saturn> 08,01and apart from the absolutely, and i use this word to its full extent, *insanely* inflammatory content and narrative, it's horribly shot and a chore to watch
<Saturn> 08,01i read somewhere that it was made as a collaboration between fundie christians and fundie islamists to stir things up in the middle east
<Saturn> 08,01no idea how true that is
<GilDash|Reading> So, to sum up, it's a crap film with the clear design to rile up people?
<GilDash|Reading> 'Cause that's what it's doing.
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash|Reading: exactly
<prince-dari> Well she's on her network, but probably idle
<MirrorImage> the "film" that's causing the riots eerywhere saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01MirrorImage: yup
<MirrorImage> evidently the producer was on probation already, so yeah...
<GilDash|Reading> Apparently there's been an embassy stormed in Australia recently over it.
<MirrorImage> GilDash|Reading - if it's Australia, i doubt it'll be "stormed" like the Lybian one was
<Saturn> 08,01if its purpose was anything other than to piss off muslims, it was not just badly thought out, but a literally mentally derranged thing to make
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos
<GilDash|Reading> MirrorImage: I dunno... this is Australia we're talking about. "Everything in Australia wants to kill you" after all.
<Saturn> 08,01it was on the front page of youtube
<Wrek> 05at first i thoguht you were talkign about "the Dictator"
<MirrorImage> GilDash|Reading - yes, but at least Australia isn't a country where that film is illegal on principle
<Kimori> your on there right now?
<Kosoveon> 10!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 6Tangela.
<Kosoveon> 10no
<sub06905> morning everypony :)
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: the Sache Baron Cohen one?
<GilDash|Reading> MirrorImage: That's what makes it the more disconcerting.
<Kosoveon> 10at least it's not tangrowth
<Saturn> 08,01also, i have a sudden urge to dig up my cat that's buried in the garden, to see how the decomposition has progressed
<thelonepony> morning sub06905
<MirrorImage> GilDash|Reading - what i mean is that the police/army would be inclined to actually defend the american embassy in australia
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> That's...
<prince-dari> Intersting Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01morbid, i know
<MirrorImage> Saturn - how long/
<AJIsAwesome> .......
<Saturn> 08,01but i'm really interested in seeing it first hand, from a scientific perspective
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, sub06905! :)
<GilDash|Reading> MirrorImage: I know that, but what I mean is it's disconcerting to see intolerance and hatred beginning to spread out everywhere.
<Saturn> 08,01MirrorImage: just over a year now
<Saturn> 08,01probably all bones by now
<GilDash|Reading> Saturn: It'll smell really, really bad.
<prince-dari> Saturn: Lawl, you'll probably want this for your coffin then http://seemerot.com/
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya sub06905 :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> prince-dari: :D haha WTF?
<MirrorImage> GilDash|Reading - "everywhere," or just everywhere with a Muslim population? Remember that this is really an issue because in those middle east countries, muslim law is national law
<MirrorImage> in Australia, it's just a protest
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: why are there porn adverts on that site...
<Saturn> 08,01that seems... misjudged.
<Saturn> 08,01or, to be honest, maybe not...
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos
<Saturn> 08,01pretty cool idea
<prince-dari> u so crazy

<PillowPoni|Phone> Lolyep
<Moopy> Uh oh i got 3 messages
<Bronysith> Wrek: i hate the fanfiction division, they only read 1 sentence of my story before rejecting it
<Alchemist> eqD might be as they are, but they are still the website to go to if you want some general news imo.
<AJTheMightyGamer> so.... anyone excited for pikmin 3?
<AJIsAwesome> I am.
<Wrek> 05Alchemist: mayhaps. but trheir posts should be taken with a bowl of salt
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone care to give suggestions for my story?
<Adjeca> yeah. i'd like to see it all, all the time. i need to do that and also i need to update my website as i've got lots more stuffs but i'm stuck on lazy mode >.<
<Wrek> 05more than ocne have thye put up info
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Does your first sentence start with "There once was an Alicorn..."? :P
<Wrek> 05claiomed its legit and official
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: no, i am no dumbass
<Wrek> 05only to take it down casue they didnt check their sources well enough
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: lol
<PillowPoni|Phone> I think the last time I read Progress was when Luna was working for the space program or something like that
<Alchemist> Wrek: of course some skepticism is encouraged no matter if its pony news or political/world news :D
<AJIsAwesome> Wasn't there a drawfriend incident one time?
<Gold_Demona> Wow, Wrek. A whole bowl? Not just a grain? :P
<Cades> lol
<Gold_Demona> That's a lot of salt.
<Wrek> 05Gold_Demona: aye

<AJTheMightyGamer> lol
<Gold_Demona> It's.... socky?
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: here people tend to fry the meats or make them as stew, but nothing like that
<Dovah> Good Moringing everypony
<Nife> I hate Sundays.
<AJIsAwesome> I'venever tried stew. :$
<AJTheMightyGamer> morning Dovah
<Nife> Too much procrastination going on.
<thelonepony> hi Dovah
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: Well, here too. But we also have meat pies.
<AJIsAwesome> I hate Tuesdays.........
<FlutterMEDIC> hi all
<MLP_Brovakiin> Yay I just successfully used the fryer for the first time \:3/

<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya FlutterMEDIC
<Dovah> hi FlutterMEDIC
<thelonepony> no Dovah
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: It's not nearly as common as grilled, fried or stewed, grant you. The pot pies are mostly found in frozen food form. :P
<alexxm> how are things FlutterMEDIC
<FlutterMEDIC> alexxm: gud
<AJIsAwesome> I've never tried stew. :$
<Gold_Demona> Stew is AWESOME. =D
<Saturn> 08,01when i have children, and they ask me why the sky is blue, i'm going to explain to them about black body peaks and rayleigh scattering

<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: well, suddenly that doesnt sound so nice anymore...
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Do it. :D
<Adjeca> hahah
<thelonepony> you have to do it:D
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: There are recipes for it of course. I've never tried to make it myself, seeing as I've never even made a REGULAR pie before. :P
<Gold_Demona> Let alone a pot pie...
*AJTheMightyGamer yawns
<thelonepony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTu2XPjB9tk&feature=BFa&list=CL8Fo_WBNo0Qg

<Saturn> 08,01is it a pie with pot in it?
<Gold_Demona> LOL
<Alchemist> Saturn: I wish
<AJIsAwesome> I would love to try a meat pie.
<Gold_Demona> Chicken Pot Pie. :P
<Gold_Demona> I also like Turkey pot pie and Beef pot pie. :3
<FlutterMEDIC> I'm just going to poot dis here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwjpbzDO0zM
<Gold_Demona> I'd LOVE to try and make it homemade if I can talk my husband into trying it. (he doesn't like pot pies)
<Saturn> 08,01did you know that originally, a pie was made with an inedible casing made of clay?
<AJIsAwesome> Hm........
<Gold_Demona> Really? :O
<AJIsAwesome> Interesting.
<Alchemist> its also funny, that we have pies too, but it looks completely different but with almost the identical recipe: http://derpy.me/9SUKF
<Hat> Why Saturn
<AceAttorneyEdge> Seems impractical.
<Hipster-pony> ohai guys
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: Those look DELICIOUS.
<AJTheMightyGamer> we also have a pink pie, but that one is not ediable
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Hipster-pony! :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Hipster-pony

<thelonepony> hi Hipster-pony :)
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: Yep. :$
<Saturn> 08,01but it was a really hard and inedible pastry
<Gold_Demona> Saturn: Was is asbestos? :P

<prince-dari> What's wrong with sixth form?
<Vordox> Phase4: Oy! http://www.taterboy.com/blog/2008/08/flash-and-javascript-communication/
<Vordox> I think I may have found something
<DashWithRainbows> The fact that only just over a week ago I quit mine because it was making me want to strangle everyone who attended it.
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, theres an old crap one and a new usefull one
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/SrYozJfVjnA
<Vordox> I'm not sure I understand this yet, Phase4 >< Just found it and new functions I've yet sen
<Vordox> seen*
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, i forget which is which but that one will work
<DashWithRainbows> Not to mention pretty much all my friends went to college or didn't go to do a second year, my school isn't capable of fulfilling an IT course like college would.
<prince-dari> My school is good in terms of people who attend, just shit in terms of rules and traditions
<DashWithRainbows> Ah, it's probably way better than mine.
<prince-dari> Grammar school, so no shithead chav wankers.
<prince-dari> Or, not many at least
<DashWithRainbows> Yep
<DashWithRainbows> Way better than mine
<prince-dari> But
<DashWithRainbows> The new year 12 was FULL of chavs.
<prince-dari> >no lessons for entire first half of school day
<prince-dari> >make you come in anyway
<DashWithRainbows> I know that feel.
<DashWithRainbows> I used to have 2 lessons straight in the morning, the rest of the day was free session
<DashWithRainbows> I had to stay in even though I couldn't do more coursework at the time.
<DashWithRainbows> That was until I started going home during my frees. still kept 100% attendance.
<prince-dari> Haha
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/4DyauAgit0E
<CrimsonPhoenix> For me that's the best skit in the whole anthology
<MadSurge> I prefer the weird Celestia walk and the Pony Quest segment :D
<Klumzeedragon> One of my favourites is the Elsewhere skit with the shooting stars.
<MadSurge> "if you saw Pinkie's twitching tail 20 screens ago, you would have seen this coming". Perfect Sierra logic right there

<prince-dari> Hahaha

<Klumzeedragon> It's hilarious at times. Like the Unicorn episoode.
<ofna01> someone ping me when its over plz
<Klumzeedragon> Speaking of Supernatural... I have yet to see season 7.
<prince-dari> Are you genuinely scared by this...?
<Gold_Demona> correction. The youtube user that sang this version is katethegreat19
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can't wait to see children of the night being overplayed when it's done

<Gold_Demona> I turned the sound off and the video stopped making sense. o_o
<twilight_sprinkle> ofna01: lesson1 of watching youtube poop: ALWAYS watch at low volume
<twilight_sprinkle> or rather rule 1
<ofna01> im laughing for real right now
<twilight_sprinkle> this is a good audio remix lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> I hate the radio edit in this
<Kandarihu> I wonder if there's some sort of volume equalization thing that can be put in place to negate ear-rape.
<ofna01> FUCK YOUuuuuuuuuuu Fuck you and fuck her tooooooo
<CrimsonPhoenix> of this song I mean
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: like it makes any sense with the audio on
<prince-dari> Kandarihu: I'm sure someone could do something about it if they were bothered enuogh
<prince-dari> enough*
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: just watch at low volume, thats what i do, avoided 99% of earrape
<ofna01> FUCK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<ofna01> xD
<Klumzeedragon> Time for some Cider while this awesomeness is going on.
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, yes. My ears become more sensitive to compensate. But it's an extra layer of bother just because the maker of the video is a tad too malicious in his trolling.
<ofna01> D:
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: yeah but theres almost always a earrape in ytp, its almost a tradition
<Landorian> aaaand then this
<ofna01> prince, i looked away and heard that
<ofna01> i nearly shat myself
*twilight_sprinkle shuts the fuck up :<
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, traditions in YTP? More like a cliche.
<Kandarihu> Oh, this one.
<Landorian> wat
<MadSurge> Puzzle!
<ofna01> erm
<twilight_sprinkle> heh, also my insane suggestion :P
<ofna01> um

<twilight_sprinkle> idk, i really like this video for some reason
<Klumzeedragon> Scoot-Scootaloo: Can we send requests, or are you just having fun with random stuff?
<twilight_sprinkle> and the sweetiebell seems fitting
<ofna01> send requests Klum
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I'm finishing up requests from ;ast time
<Kandarihu> Oooh. That was a long time ago.

<Klumzeedragon> Probably. :P
<Ace> Really, the fuck is thgis Pinkie?
<Klumzeedragon> And twilight_sprinkle, yeah, a little bit.
<MadSurge> Somehow I think that Sweetie Belle was in the original video too...
<Landorian> this is what happens in the process of pinkie breaking the 4th wall
<ofna01> stream wants to shoot itself

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Stu is best Engie
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, i tried to work together a 'zombie nazies' joke but then started thinking about godwins law instead
<Phase4> 00,02this is what happens when i no sleep
<Lil_B> Klumzeedragon yes we do, but our Government doesn't... or maybe these people are just personaly offended by the way these people tread fellow Zombies
<cowvarkian> they've had ubisoft games on the N64, the NES the SNES, and so on....
<Lil_B> whats Godwins law again? I forgot >.<
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: bringing up hitler in an argument
<cowvarkian> basicly
<Lil_B> oh :/
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, as a conversation goes on, the chance of nazies being mentioned aproaches 1
<Phase4> 00,02nazies or hitler
<Unnr> Lil_B: As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1
<Phase4> 00,02either way
<Unnr> Gah, you just beat me Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02Unnr probably quoted it better
<Unnr> >_<
<Phase4> 00,02i am the ninja phase
<Klumzeedragon> Lil_B: I know. It was a joke. I'm 1/2 German if that means anything these days.

<Klumzeedragon> Ninja Phase needs to be sleeping Phase. :O

<ofna02> i agree Ingwaz
<Gold_Demona> My house is without nutella. O.o
<ofna02> i have 2 jars in my cabinet right now
<Lil_B> Ingwaz a house without nutella is a sad house
<Ingwaz> so many years i went and never had it...and now there is a large jar in my home...and theres SOO MUCH OF IT
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back..........
<Lil_B> hi there Dark92Enigma

<ofna02> Ing
<ofna02> i use it for toast
<Dark92Enigma> Engi you sound familiar
<Engi> with using many dots
<Ingwaz> ofna02: thats what i've been using it for
<Ingwaz> ofna02: but surely there are other things it would go great with
<Lil_B> Ingwaz I merely use it plain on bread or Toast
<ofna02> pancakes
<Phase4> 00,02https://xkcd.com/1109/ i want one
<ofna02> its really good on pancakes
<nickstr> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> nickstr, you are a 13Gengar.
<Dark92Enigma> and because of the humidity, the keyboard got screwed up, and that's why the tv won't work
<ofna02> sounds bad bro
<Dark92Enigma> so i'm sorry if i unleashed my anger yesterday
<Kandarihu> Phase4, if I were to get a fridge like that, it would have to be tweaked a bit.
<ofna02> what did you do yesterday Dark?
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, adjustable roller speed or something else?
<Ingwaz> o.o an apple with nutella sounds amazing
<Dark92Enigma> ofna02: shout out my troubles in canterlock caps lock
<Kandarihu> More space for the '12 hours' section.
<Lil_B> Tekken Tag Tournement... with Super Mario Bros and Link Costumes :P
<Gold_Demona> Now you've done it Angelica. You made Santa quit. D:<
<Dark92Enigma> So, the A movie was Galaxy Quest......what's it about?
<Kandarihu> Well, immediate openings for a new Santa.
<Dark92Enigma> Gold_Demona: are you watching Rugrats?
<Ingwaz> Dark92Enigma: its like star trek, if instead of taking itself seriously it was a comedy (and i mean the new movie)
<Gold_Demona> Dark92Enigma: I'm watching the stream, which is showing Rugrats. :P
<Dark92Enigma> Gold_Demona: my stream isn't doing anything......
<Klumzeedragon> Ingwaz: Like... Spaceballs?
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S JUST LAGGING
<Gold_Demona> Refresh?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03refresh, floozies!
<Dark92Enigma> And buffering
<Dark92Enigma> ok
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03speaking of refreshing, brb...
<Ingwaz> Klumzeedragon: no, thats full on comedy. this is more like hey, its supposed to look serious, but its actually just for laughs
<Spectrum_Rush> Rugrats
<Ingwaz> Klumzeedragon: spaceballs is far better than galaxy quest
<ofna02> space bawls
<Dark92En|gma> Still nothing......just buffering..........WAIT, IT WORKS
<Dark92En|gma> Barely
<Klumzeedragon> Oh and aw. :D Now I don't have high hopes for Galaxy Quest.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good morning everyone

<Ingwaz> Dark92Enigma: not sure if that was some sort of joke or not... hopefully she didnt wear a diaper
<MadSurge> Ingwaz: good vocal range?
<Lil_B> wow, appearently Nintendo is the Developer for LegoCity Undercover :/ anyway, Video is over now XD
<Dark92En|gma> Ingwaz: no, but according to her interview, she even sucked her own toes :D (she might be trolling)
<Ingwaz> MadSurge: that much is already obvious. its just impressive to see her be able to do that as well as its quite different from many of her other voices
<drf|work> ugh, script spam
<Ingwaz> Dark92Enigma: yeah....sounds like something she would say
<Dark92En|gma> of course
<Angel_Espeon> 13ugh, drf complaining

<Dark92En|gma> Ok, a question: do you think Spongebob is hogging all the glory Rugrats once had? i think not
<ofna02> nope
<Dark92En|gma> so i thought
<ofna01> derp
<Kimori_mobile> did I miss anything? >.>
<Gold_Demona> I think Spongebob is overrated, but other than that... =/
<Dark92En|gma> yeah, but classic Spongebob is better than the actual one....that's all we can agree on
<Dark92En|gma> I'll save you, Tara!
<Cynder7> 6Nope :P
<Cynder7> 6Gtg..see you guys!

<Dark92En|gma> PARTY CANNON
<thelonepony> and don't forget today is a school day for someponies
<Klumzeedragon> Otherwise the only time it's more is on Movie Nights. :D Where 50 thousand people sign on.

<Klumzeedragon> Do we stream ponies a lot during the seasons?
<Klumzeedragon> I havent been around here for a season yet. :D
<Tervicz> all the time
<Tervicz> If they get aired
<Dark92En|gma> Bronystate becomes very important at a premiere
<Applejack2011> I think we can beat the Royal Wedding views under the first S3
<Dark92En|gma> Applejack2011: if the first episode can top that off
<Dark92En|gma> WHICH IT CAN BE POSSIBLE
<Klumzeedragon> How many viewers were there for Royal Wedding? :D
<Dark92En|gma> Over 1006
<thelonepony> :O

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03CAAARp
<Ponyloverforever> magicarp

<Kammerjunk> I remember watching the Danish dub. I laughed, I cried.
<Kammerjunk> Mostly, I cried.
<Gold_Demona> Looked like bubble to me
<Panda> Wait a second, does this mean we are gonna see the *actual* movie that comes after this?
<rdibp> :D
<alexxm> i thought it could only use splash
<Lil_B> killerpony7733 some were the same, but a lot had changed names, I only remember pikachu, new and newtwo to have the same names everywhere
<kidzrul434> Psyduck is a worthless pokemon. He never does anything
<Gold_Demona> alexxm: It also learns tackle. :P

<Lil_B> Panda Gameshark!
<Gold_Demona> kidsrul434: I shall correct you. MISTY'S Psyduck is worthless... other than when it goes nuts and does confusion and psychic to pwn everything. :P
<Kammerjunk> I have never played Pokémon. This sounds like some sort of crazy moon language to me.
<kidzrul434> Squirtle and maril have caused the apocolypse

<MadSurge> So is this the WHOLE movie or just the pre-movie cartoon?
<Viri> 14o.o
<Vinyer> no, don't o.o me
<Panda> Premovie
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda: if only i could ever force myself to do that, instead i always wait til the last moment :D
<Lil_B> MadSurge pre-Movie
<MadSurge> Okies
<Gold_Demona> premovie short
<thelonepony> premovie
<rdibp> MadSurge: i think it picks up halfway through
<Panda> yeah
<MadSurge> Hey Panda!
<ofna01> i like how meowth is the only pokemon that actually talks
<alexxm> even on his day off mewoth gets screwed
<Panda> MadSurge, hello there.
<killerpony7733> ofna01 It's explained why though
<Kandarihu> I'd rather not say
<BladedWings> K.O.!
<Applejack2011> hello
<MadSurge> ofna01: well, he learned to talk!
<ofna01> why killer?
<Lil_B> I kinda like the Vocal Tracks, so late 90's (and these Transitions -.-)
<Gold_Demona> Chansey! 8D
<ofna01> Ah
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, no.........Charizard. :D
<Panda> Dat sleepy charizard.
<cachi01|phone> ofna01 thts not true! We have a pikachu that talks!!
<Panda> WAIT!
<Panda> DAT ANGRY Charizard.
<Lil_B> he just lost 10hp because of stomp
<ofna01> pikachu says Pika...
<Panda> oh no
<rdibp> *sudden realization* meowth is chasing pikachu because its a game of cat and mouse :O:O:O!
<kidzrul434> the end he dies
<Panda> SQUISH
<Gold_Demona> ofna01: There was a Lucario that talked in one of the movies. And a Slowking in the second movie.
<ofna01> icwuttheydidthat rdash
<Lil_B> Relaxo used Überroller
<BladedWings> rdibp: -_(\ bad pun is bad
<cachi01|phone> ofna01 translation of pika = sup boys pikachu is in the house mudabuckas
<killerpony7733> ofna01 He tried to say...impress a female meowth and at some point he stayed at a attic where he overheard humans talking and eventually learned to mimic and speak
<ofna01> xD
<Panda> rdibp btw, that joke was funny in 1997
<Eli> rdibp: you're right... i actually never noticed
<rdibp> dat train
<Lil_B> Charizard has rather badass sounds
<killerpony7733> ofna01 But there are very few pokemons that can speak too
<ofna01> o_O
<alexxm> oh god they're everywhere
<AJIsAwesome> ..................
*rdibp dies X_X
<Panda> KILL THEM WITH FIRE
*AJIsAwesome revives rdibp
<Eli> killerpony7733: but except for Mewtwo they all suck
<Gold_Demona> Meowth taught himself how to talk to impress a female meowth who wound up dumping him afterward cuz now he was a freak. :P
<Lil_B> We will end his suffering... bring the Rifle!
<cachi01|phone> zuul mothebuckers http://t.co/cM0LlSGj ZUUUUUUL!
<Gold_Demona> That girl meowth was a spoiled bitch anyhow
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Oh, that's terrible. :D
<killerpony7733> ofna01 But meowth learned it through actual training and discipline by himself of course
<Panda> Gold_Demona yeah... but at least he can talk. If anything I think Meowth should be a stronger pokemon because of that.
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome it's the only way! THE ONLY WAY!
<rdibp> :'(
<Klumzeedragon> cachi01|phone: You know, For kids!
<Kandarihu> He defied nature to become humanlike.
<AJIsAwesome> THE END
<Dragonmatte> poor charizard :(
<Ponyloverforever> poor charziard :'(
<Lil_B> awww:'(
<rdibp> :'(:'(
<thelonepony> :'(
<killerpony7733> ofna01 Mewtwo is telepathic not vocal which is two different things
<Panda> This needs subtitles.
<Lil_B> Tear jerker #1 as a kid
<cachi01|phone> Klumzeedragob its from Ponymon lol
<Gold_Demona> Panda: Thing is, because he used all that effort to talk, he has trouble with regular pok?mon moves. Which is why he can never learn Payday
<twilight_sprinkle> what a speechg :'(

<twilight_sprinkle> cubone the thug
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03ya lol
<rdibp> which is better? pokemon tears or pheniox tears?
<Gold_Demona> Cubone's antisocial
<alexxm> what happened did charizard kill cubones mum
<Lil_B> this movie has a rather nice orchestral score Oo I'm suprised
<kidzrul434> cubone forevert alone
<cachi01|phone> cubone.......UR MOM IS DED HAHAHAHAHA
<Panda> Scoot-Scootaloo D: teach me Pokekiin!
<Dark92En|gma> alexxm: i'm fine, bro.......but i missed Rugrats
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootaloo, more like 50. He speaks in a character voice.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: More like Cubone the smug. :P
<Vinyer> ?
<rdibp> RIP Cubone mom :'(
<Panda> So... cubon is the strongest one there, considering it work only after cubone starts working.
<Eli> the egg thing is soo cute:D
<Dark92En|gma> OK...........how did the Rugrats special finished? i missed it because of my BABY BROTHER
<Lil_B> I'
<rdibp> dat lag

<BladedWings> psyduck sticks the landing
<rdibp> dat gangnum stlye
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I think so.
<Gold_Demona> It's game canon that Cubone wears the skull of its mother
<Barbetos|AtWork> psyduck owns you
<Panda> twilight_sprinkle it makes sense though. I mean he is called the *lonely pokemon* for a reason.
<alexxm> what did your brother do Dark92Enigma|gma
<cachi01|phone> twilight_sprinkle yes its canon. And cubone's original name was going to be orfan
<Dark92En|gma> Gold_Demona: ikr?
<twilight_sprinkle> Gold_Demona: das creepy
<Dark92En|gma> dem SEGWAYS

<Ponyloverforever> aw :)
<cachi01|phone> fun fact: cubone's original name waa going to be orfan

<Meanwhile> The most powerful pokemon of all...you know, until the next gen.
<Panda> twilight_sprinkle yup.
<Eli> mew is my freaking screen background! i don't care much about pokemon anymore, but Mew is just way too cute :$
<Vinyer> can you take a document for me and convert it into a PDF?
<killerpony7733> Barbetos|AtWork I believe so
<rdibp> my name is rdibp not rdbip
<drf|work> OK
<drf|work> so can you though
<Vinyer> because libreoffice does not want to display it correctly
<drf|work> install doPDF and print it to that
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos|AtWork: First one aired in Japan only. It was dark.
<drf|work> that's why you don't use that crap :P
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome what is it about?
<Eli> yo Mewtwo! your mother is a hair!
*PillowPoni|Phone is hungry

<killerpony7733> Oh yeah this is pretty dark too for pokemon
*MLP_Brovakiin shares his dinner with PillowPoni|Phone :3
<Barbetos|AtWork> I remember this one I think. They gave away holgraphic mew two trading cards for the showings

<BladedWings> PillowPoni|Phone: then go eat lol
<drf|work> why are you using Linux
<Panda> AJIsAwesome yeah, you can get it ^^
<Vinyer> because i feel more secure using it in public places
<Dark92En|gma> TRIVIA: There are several versions of the movie: 1 with Pikachu's vacation, the 2nd with the DNA trailer, and the 3rd with BOTH OF THEM
<AJIsAwesome> Panda: Cool.
<twilight_sprinkle> i used to have that card :<
<PillowPoni|Phone> MLP_Brovakiin, thank you~
<Applejack2011> remember the holo cards too

<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: I saw that.
<Kimori> yo
*Panda had 6 ancient mews from this movie.
<Gold_Demona> Ancient Mew card. I think I still have mine somewhere...

<Applejack2011> Early Queen Chrysalis
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs PillowPoni|Phone Its cool :3

<Vinyer> but i keep forgetting to do it XD
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda: i also had 6. and lost/gave away all of themm :[
<Meanwhile> This is a very rushed..."Who am I? Where am I? what is my existence?" scenario.

<Dark92En|gma> M. Bison: OF COURSE
<Vinyer> home edition i think
<Dark_Horst> let'S blow some budget in a meaningless 180° shot
<drf|work> then you can't do an upgrade
<Dark92En|gma> What a comeback, Misty
<Meanwhile> Yeah well you're just a meanypants!
<Barbetos|AtWork> pointless scene in a pointless movie.
<Vinyer> i wouldn't do an upgrade anyway
<Ponymon-Anarchy> in mewtwo returns mewtwo is played by the voice actor of yami yugi
<Vinyer> believe it or not
<Dark92En|gma> Meanwhile: Insert Ken reference
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh wait. This movie was not pointless. It made Nintendo even more monies.
<Gold_Demona> All for the sake of having Team Rocket in the movie. :P
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst me nether, I have seren it 1ßß times, but that was long ago :(
<Vinyer> but my vista installation has close to nothing important on it XD
<Whiskra> aka Dan Green
<MLP_Brovakiin> Throw a pokeball at his ass while he ain't lookin'
<Alchemist> Dark_Horst: its not like the rest of the animation is expensive
<Meanwhile> Oh my god...he gave them tattoos!
<rdibp> O///O
<thisguy> dat ass
<Dark92En|gma> Meanwhile: Ken: And you.....you're a LOSER -----Street fighter cartoon reference
<Vinyer> the most valuable thing vista contains in fact is this installation of linux since it's installed through mint4windows lol
<drf|work> k
<Viri> 14o.o
<rdibp> thisguy :[
<drf|work> yeah, upgrade installs suck
<Dark92En|gma> AYYAYAYAY...QUE HICISTE JESSIE
<Barbetos|AtWork> I just noticed, that all the pokemon are nakid.
<Vinyer> yeah
<Barbetos|AtWork> This is a movie for kids too.
<Vinyer> they can make things buggy
<drf|work> wipe the hard drive with GParted and install Windows 7 xD
<Meanwhile> It's like they're wearing nothing at all...
<Vinyer> i was curious though
<rdibp> Dark92En|gma: :|
<Dark92En|gma> Just for a fur........:'(
<Barbetos|AtWork> Clone james!
<Snow> its like breeding, but easier...
<Vinyer> if i can take the virutal disk for linux out of vista
<thisguy> its like applejack said "we dont normally wear clothes"
<Gold_Demona> Who's that pok?mon?!
<Vinyer> install 7, install mint4windows
<Meanwhile> It's Gloom!
<drf|work> um
<drf|work> why the frick
<drf|work> would you use a Windows based Linux install
<Dark92En|gma> Barbetos|AtWork: All the ponies are usually naked
<Vinyer> then replace the virutal disk with the virtual disk with my previous linux installation if that would work
<rdibp> so that is how pokemon are born
<drf|work> just install it side by side
<Dark92En|gma> rdibp: what did i do wrong?
<Vinyer> i was told it's best not to do that
*Snow died again.
<Gold_Demona> And that's how Equestria was made.
<Applejack2011> we normally don't wear clothes
*rdibp revives Snow
<Vinyer> because if grub gets testy, everything is ruined
<Dark_Horst> god fucking dammit, the movie doesnt force the plot at all
<thisguy> aww, i wouldve liked an exact clone of mew
<Gold_Demona> We normally don't wear clones
<Barbetos|AtWork> Dark92En|gma: No! It can't be! Its IMPOSSIBLE!!
<Dark_Horst> not at fucking all
<Snow> thanks.
<rdibp> IMPOSSIBRU
<smelt> and we succeeded......
<drf|work> um
<Meanwhile> Pokenstein.
<Vinyer> i can't remember who said that
<drf|work> it's super easy to fix GRUB...
<Barbetos|AtWork> So that guy made a voice log right befor he died.
<Dark92En|gma> TAKE A GUESS
<Snow> mew :3
<thelonepony> Mew :3
<drf|work> but the better solution is just to run Linux in a VM
<rdibp> :3
<Snow> HA! i was first
<Vinyer> why do i keep thinking it was HyperMetalLugia
<Barbetos|AtWork> Star date AGGGHHHHAHHHAHAH!!

<AJIsAwesome> DATS RACIST!
<Vinyer> i don't know drf
<Vinyer> i am trying at all costs to preserve my current linux installation
<rdibp> ded
<smelt> is it just me or does mewtwo look like giygas?
<Gold_Demona> I always found it funny how MewTwo has a handle on the back of his head. :P
<Snow> pikachu: WROOOOOOOOOOOOONG!
<Dark_Horst> i see that tail and all i think is "wow, he could do his own tentacle porn"
<drf|work> why
<Dark92Enigma> WHY IS GARY DIFFERENT?
<AJIsAwesome> Gold_Demona: That's how you carry him around. :D
<Vinyer> you have no idea how hard i had to work to get linux to work with the wireless card on this laptop
<drf|work> also HML is an idiot
<drf|work> don't listen to his computer advice
<Dark_Horst> bear sound
<Barbetos|AtWork> Mewtwo the dumbest smart pokemon on the planet
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dark92Enigma cause tha's not gary
<Gold_Demona> Maybe that's his weakness. XD
<rdibp> Dark92Enigma: aliens
<Whiskra> the handle is because his brain is so extraordinary, one throat to support all the blood for his brain isnt enough
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Shoulda used a master ball...
<thisguy> grab the bull by the horns
<drf|work> I've dualbooted Windows and Linux plenty of times and all he's done is broken people's Windows installations
<AJIsAwesome> You should've had Rhydon.
<Meanwhile> Guess Mewtwo never learned the magic of friendship.
<Vinyer> i don't even know how i fixed it
<Snow> indeed
<thisguy> forget that, use a burlap sack
<Vinyer> it started wanted to work with the wireless card after i removed the wireless card driver XD
<Dark92Enigma> rdibp: TheGreatAndPowerfulT CHANGELINGS, perhaps?
<Vinyer> wanting
<rdibp> mewtwo for season 3 villan?
<smelt> IS THAT A CHALLENGE?!
<Snow> forget pokemon, use a shotgun

<Snow> TEAM DEATHMATCH
<Gold_Demona> We need the elements of harmony!
<Dark92Enigma> ME OLIÓ A CONSOME DE POKEMON
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dark92Enigma they never say it's gary to begin with
<Vinyer> which makes no sense to me whatsoever
<smelt> slurrrrrrp

<Ponymon-Anarchy> Mewtwo vs. Darkrai

<Dark92Enigma> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: i grew up with the Latin American dub of this movie, in it, they said it was Gary

<Snow> NOO NOT CHARIZARD YOU IDIOT
<Lil_B> smelt the same studio made the game (APE inc. made Earthbound, got changed into Creatures INC. who made pokemon) but the guy who came up with all the designs was someone from a magazine whos owner came up with the idea of Pokemon, thus he has nothing to do with Earthbound
<Meanwhile> Charizard is such an angry bugger.
<MadSurge> NO SELL

<Dark92Enigma> Gold_Demona: i know.....but that was a running joke in the Latinamerican dun, don't blame me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Dark92Enigma don't remember but it's probably just the dub changing things
<rdibp> me
<Snow> why does he forget every time that charizard isnt listning to him?
<Meanwhile> I'll never understand that. Didn't Ash save his life when he was only Charmander?
<Gold_Demona> Dark92Enigma: Ah, ok. :P
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Yep. :D
<drf|work> it's simple
<drf|work> just do lspci, find out what card it is, download the driver
<drf|work> you should ask me for help instead of HML LOL

<Dark_Horst> bruteroot.... okay

<Dark92Enigma> SHELLSHOCKER!!!!!

<smelt> backwards hat means badass
<thisguy> i want to see
<smelt> normal hat means female
<Lil_B> Ash has yet to learn a powerful Pimü's Backhand-Handslap
<Panda> Scoot-Scootaloo, Snow, Mew is now Fluttershy's hair http://imgur.com/UDzMJ
<thelonepony> Adorable :3
<Serenity> Mew: Oh you fucker, it begins.
<AJIsAwesome> Gen 1 Shadow Ball?
<BladedWings> Mewtwo used shadowball
<Ponymon-Anarchy> did shadow ball exist in gen 1?
<Snow> Panda: amazing!

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Panda: Oh lawdy, i have to see this colored :D
<Gold_Demona> No, Shadowball did not exist in Gen 1
<Meanwhile> Mew is totally fucking ignoring him#
*Snow died even more because mew.
<rdibp> what is this a dr seuss book?
<Dark92Enigma> MARIO MARIO AND LUIGI MARIO
<Gold_Demona> It came about in Gen 2
<Panda> Scoot-Scootaloo when I return from the store ill do that :)
<Ponymon-Anarchy> gotcha
<Panda> thank you Snow, Lil_B ^^
<Dark92Enigma> KAKARRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOT
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03looking forward to it!
<Meanwhile> Mew literally does not care.
<Ponymon-Anarchy> so what movei is that?
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: I hatd that bit in the movie. :|
<rdibp> ded
<DashWithRainbows> Panda I will love you for ten whole seconds if you colour that!
<MadSurge> Mewtroll
<smelt> MEW STRIKES BACK! *movie name pun for the obviously challenged*
<Serenity> Mew gives around as many fucks as I do.
<Gold_Demona> Mew's like "Oh no you DIDn't!"
<Snow> mew got hit by mewtwo?
<Panda> DashWithRainbows D: only ten? But I wun you forever ;A;
<Panda> wub*
<Snow> IM RAGING OVER HERE!
<AJIsAwesome> How did Mewtwo NOT see that? :S
<DashWithRainbows> Sorry, Gary's girth has me forever/
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: ME too........but the ''Mew and Mewtwo'' title drop reminded me of it
<Panda> D:
<Panda> Alright, brb
<Whiskra> Mew's speech to Mewtwo is different in the Japanese version. In the English version, Mew gives a speech about how real strength comes from the heart, whereas in the Japanese version, Mew declares that all unnatural life (ie, clones) are inferior to the originals, and thus should perish.
<smelt> yes,you were also created with a sexy voice
<MadSurge> Pffft, I bet Mewtwo is shit compared to modern legendaries
<Meanwhile> Mewmewmewmewmewmewmew.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03is gary even in this movie?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Convenient traduction
<CrimsonPhoenix> Scoot-Scootaloo, he's too awesome for this movie

<thelonepony> :3
<rdibp> OUR FINALE BATTLE BEGINS
<smelt> yes
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: In the beginning, I think.
<DashWithRainbows> If he was Scoot-Scootaloo, he would just have to show up and MewTwo would be his slave.
<Gold_Demona> Scoot-Scootaloo: Gary got pwned by MewTwo in Giovanni's gym
<Meanwhile> Scoot-Scootaloo: He was briefly seen in the Mewtwo training montage, getting his ass beat.
<AJIsAwesome> Whiskra: Wow...........
<Dark92Enigma> Scoot-Scootaloo: dub fail....i'll tell you later
<rdibp> CHAAAAAAAAAAAAARGE
<smelt> AJIsAwesome: you are correct
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03oh yeah

<rdibp> bbbff
<Dark92Enigma> And so, Ash learns a valauble lesson.............Fighting must be...............wrong :'(
<AJIsAwesome> DAT SONG DISSONANCE
<Snow> rdibp: iseewhatyoudidthere.
<Meanwhile> This music does not fit very well.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03OH you know what I should do?
<Serenity> If they cloned me, the clone would have so much HP and firepower it would be unbeleiveable.
<rdibp> this
<rdibp> is
<rdibp> epic
<Serenity> Thank god I wasn't there, eh :)
<Dark_Horst> "fighting is bad" SAID THE MOVIE TO THE SERIES WHICHS ENTIRE PURPOSE IS FUCKING FIGHTING
<rdibp> GO PONYTA
<CrimsonPhoenix> best part

<Nyst> It's mr. Fish!
<AJIsAwesome> Well, it depends on your definition of fighting and to the extent of your fighting.
<Dark92Enigma> When will we learn? :'(
<CrimsonPhoenix> NInetails <3
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst "You are not supposed to Fight LIKE THIS" You are meant to fight like gentlemens
<Gold_Demona> I thought the moral was that "you can't judge a person by where they came from".
<Ponymon-Anarchy> mewtwo vs. arceus

<Snow> ...
<Meanwhile> As if the original music wasn't unfitting enough.
<Snow> fits so well.
<MadSurge> Why are they fighting again?
<DashWithRainbows> The atmosphere has been crushed...
<MLP_Brovakiin> ^

<AJIsAwesome> AND IT'S A HOME RUN!!!!!!
<Dark_Horst> them's getting snuggly
<CrimsonPhoenix> Serenity, The anime has close to no continuity
<CrimsonPhoenix> and that was basically a fan-service
<AJIsAwesome> Serenity: Yeah, since Captain Falcon dies in the anime.
<Dark92Enigma> Yes, violence is never the answer in any situa----Oh, you're still going. Sorry.
<twilight_sprinkle> mmewtwo needs to work on his bioengineering

<Lil_B> I'll get the Funnel for more emotional explaining how fighting like this iswrong
<Gold_Demona> But... Fighting is Magic
<AJIsAwesome> AND THEN MEOWTH BECAME A THIRD WHEEL

<Dark92Enigma> Am I the only one who finds it a little ironic that a franchise that's made it's whole profit on nothing BUT fighting, is suddenly telling us that it's BAD to be fighting?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, no you're not
<twilight_sprinkle> NOW COUNTERATTACK WHILE HES TIRED
<Snow> KABOOOOOM!
<cowvarkian> If someone touches you and it makes you feel bad, thats no good.
<CrimsonPhoenix> now for the best part
<Meanwhile> Now snap his neck like a fortune cookie.
<TheMonstaMuffin> waow
<rdibp> Dark92Enigma: dat nc quote
<Dark92Enigma> How fucking hypocritical is that? That's like O.J. Simpson going around telling everyone that it's bad to kill people.
<Snow> dbz refference there
<Dark92Enigma> rdibp: he has a point
<Serenity> It's film logic
<Snow> RIGHT THERE.
<Serenity> Get dafuq over it
<Gold_Demona> Dark92Enigma: I always took it as Pok?mon battles being more like playful competition, which is why the pok?mon don't die. But THISA fight is one where they're literally trying to kill each other.
<Snow> dat aura.
<Dark92Enigma> Snow IT'S OVER 9000?
<Serenity> Snow: DBZ came AGES after this did
<Ponymon-Anarchy> the lesson is not to just fight
<rdibp> once again, inb4 :'(
<AJIsAwesome> Gold_Demona: Agreed.
<ArcherJoe11> And Ash ded
<Ponymon-Anarchy> but to not figjt for no good reason
<rdibp> ded
<Serenity> DED
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ded
<Ponymon-Anarchy> but to fight for what is right
<thelonepony> ded
<Meanwhile> Well that was fucking stupid.
<cowvarkian> and thats how equestria was made
<DashWithRainbows> GAME OVER YEEEEAAAAAH!
<AJIsAwesome> cowvarkian: :D
<rdibp> HE'S DED GOKU! JE'S DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
<Dark_Horst> and of course he is still not meat confetti
<CrimsonPhoenix> and now
<CrimsonPhoenix> for the most
<rdibp> :'(
<Dark92Enigma> FAIL..........you idiot.....:'(
<Lil_B> he died for your Sins!
<ArcherJoe11> Ponymon-Anarchy: Like Money?
<twilight_sprinkle> makes sense?
<Meanwhile> And then he died. The end.
<CrimsonPhoenix> non-sensical scene
<Gold_Demona> And Ash turned to stone... For some reason
<Dark_Horst> YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE!
<Snow> ash forgot how to DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODGEEE
<CrimsonPhoenix> ever made into history
<Dark92Enigma> YOU ANIMALS.........HE'S ALREADY DEAD
<Ponymon-Anarchy> ArcherJoe11: wat?
<alexxm> why is he stone
<cowvarkian> Your dodge failed
<twilight_sprinkle> cause why the buck not
<Dark92Enigma> Snow
<Dark_Horst> pikachu. bio defibrilator
<Dark92Enigma> Snow i forgot that one
<smelt> an alternative line to what misty said: my bike......*atmosphere ruined*
<twilight_sprinkle> CLEAR
<TheMonstaMuffin> DEAD
<Meanwhile> Live you stone bastard!
<Magical_Pablez94> ......that pikachu....
<Dark_Horst> IT'S A ROCK, YOU DUMB YELLOW RAT
<Whiskra> When Pikachu is repeatedly shocking Ash to try to bring him back to life, Misty says "Pikachu..." in the Japanese version, and "Please, no..." in the English version. A commentary revealed that the dubbers had many alternatives for this piece of dialog, one of them being, "My bike..." LOL
<Dark92Enigma> :'(
<Gold_Demona> LOL smelt
<ArcherJoe11> Ponymon-Anarchy: Fight for the right thing. In Pokemon games it's money. Or you won't be able to buy Pokeballs.
<cowvarkian> I really want to see a pikajew
<Dark92Enigma> A ROCK.........
<Dark92Enigma> THAT'S MY DESTINY
<TheMonstaMuffin> xD
<AJIsAwesome> Whiskra: That's terrible. :D

<CrimsonPhoenix> HERE WE GO
<Serenity> SPARKLES
<Snow> OH MY GOD A GIANT ROCK
<rdibp> :'(:'(:'(
<Lil_B> WE BELIEVE IN SANTA CHRIST!
<Meanwhile> Fuck off charizard you never liked him anyway.
<Ponymon-Anarchy> and you also ended up defeating team rocket
<Nyst> That's a lot of sparkles
<Gold_Demona> :'(
<Dark_Horst> this scene make sme angry
<DashWithRainbows> And no feels were given that day.
<alexxm> sparkle sparkle sparkle
<Dark92Enigma> WE CARE...........:'(
<twilight_sprinkle> SANTA CHRIST, SANTA CHRIIIIIST
<Viri> 14o.o
<Serenity> So many sparkles, cannot run them
<rdibp> dat donkey
<TheMonstaMuffin> The power of, umm... Sadness?
<ArcherJoe11> Lil_B: I believe in Santa Christ
<Gold_Demona> LMAO Dark92Enigma
<rdibp> :'(:'(
<thelonepony> :'(
<cowvarkian> And then ash lived
<Gold_Demona> :'(
<Snow> LET THE LEMON JUICE BRING HIM BACK TO LIFE!
<Dark92Enigma> WE BELIEVE IN SANTA CHRIST :'(
<cowvarkian> BLAM SHAM WOW
<rdibp> i believe in santa christ
<Serenity> 'dat stone, powered by hate
<alexxm> why is this happening
<CrimsonPhoenix> I really love the NC review of this
<smelt> DISTURB NOT THE POWER OF FIRE ICE AND LIGHTNING ETC:THUS THE WORLD WILL TURN TO ASH! oh wait wrong movie......
<Eli> that made me cry when i was 7 :'(
<rdibp> :'(:'(
<CrimsonPhoenix> so much
<Gold_Demona> Adn should've been named Gary instead. Cuz HE"S SUCH A GARY STU!!!
<ArcherJoe11> Ash is Undead now, doomed to stay Ten forever.
<BladedWings> I BELIEVE IN SANTA CHRIST!
<thelonepony> :'(
<Nyst> That's impossible! Also disgusting.
<rdibp> last one for good measure, :'(
<Dark_Horst> this shouldnt be able to work becasue of so many fucking reasons that i cant decide where to start with naming them all
<Lil_B> This made me cry so often as a kid... every damn time :(
<cowvarkian> ArcherJoe11: I can see that
<Gold_Demona> ArcherJoe11: LMAO That explains everything! :D
<Dark92Enigma> Why tears are like the A-BOMB in here?
<Snow> 2000 made me cry more
<Serenity> I feel nothing for this.
<TheMonstaMuffin> The first film that ever made me cry was E.T
<DashWithRainbows> He would make an excellent statue for my garden.
<Meanwhile> Fun fact, because of the way the tear ducts are connected to the sinuses, a lot of that is probably Pokemon snot.
<Snow> sorry to say it
<Eli> Nyst: quoting R&L nice
<Gold_Demona> The Celebi movie made me cry more than that
<rdibp> i guess crying does solve your problems after all
<Snow> true dat.
<Snow> 4 ever
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: i get you. thouhg i only saw it once
<AJIsAwesome> Gold_Demona: Which one?
<Snow> i have that on dvd
<ArcherJoe11> cowvarkian, Gold_Demona: in Pokemon Best wishes, the narrator says Ash is STILL 10!!
<Dark92Enigma> If that's what tears can do.......i wonder what SNOTS can do!
<twilight_sprinkle> you know,if you look past childhood memories, this is one dumbass scene
<Ingwaz> YES!! mlp got the tubey award
<cowvarkian> ArcherJoe11: seems legit
<Snow> *thinks about it*
<Dark_Horst> aw, look at them ninetails
<Dark92Enigma> rdibp: that Spongebob reference
<Nyst> Eli: I have no idea what R&L is. But thanks anyway.
<CrimsonPhoenix> damn I love Ninetails
<Snow> i actually have EVERY pokemon film ._.
<Gold_Demona> AJIsAwesome: I guess it's 4Ever?
<rdibp> oh really :D
<TheMonstaMuffin> I gotta get some food in my stomach. Cya laterz guys :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Snow even the G4 ones?
<Gold_Demona> AJIsAwesome: The one that also has Suicune
<CrimsonPhoenix> and G5?
<Meanwhile> I see now...that this movie is terribly paced.
<rdibp> :')
<cowvarkian> and then everyone died
<Snow> i have one till the new one
<Whiskra> So, are people even dying in that world? I mean, they mustve discovered that tears bring back the dead to life so they mustve had harvested the tears as some sort of miracle medicine
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03so... pokemon 2000 next time?
<Serenity> WEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Snow> victini
<AJIsAwesome> Scoot-Scootaloo: YES!!!!!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> oh, pokemon 2000 was good
<Nyst> I guess the lesson is that pokemon tears cure petrify.
<twilight_sprinkle> better than this imo
<Obsidian> Hey every- are we streaming pokemon?
<Gold_Demona> Pok?mon Movies! Yay!~ 8D
<DashWithRainbows> Scoot-Scootaloo Strange enough I watched that yesterday.
<Lil_B> Scoot-Scootaloo when is "Nest Time"?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Obsidian! :)
<cowvarkian> apparently Obsidian
<smelt> and now,the clones all float toward their creator....and thus tthe world was saved.....then everypony here forgot what happened
<ArcherJoe11> Mew-Two = Awesome Voice and Life Lessons. Mew = Kitty Cat?
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Lil_B> Scoot-Scootaloo otherwise... YES!
<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile: i say the japanese version is more concise, i guess
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03idunno lol, maybe friday morning!
<Dark_Horst> and then mewtwo was peter pan
<CrimsonPhoenix> and THEN THEY FORGET EVERYTHING
<twilight_sprinkle> and then he wiped there memories<.< LAAAAAME
<rdibp> hai Obsidian, can i mine you? :3
<Dark92Enigma> AFTER ALL OF THAT LESSON!?!
<twilight_sprinkle> *their
<Snow> adn then you could find mewtwo in a cave
<Obsidian> ummmm.. no
<cowvarkian> and then it was dream
<Meanwhile> Und dann it was all a dreeeeaaaam.
<Meanwhile> Stupid buggers.
<Dark_Horst> Dark92Enigma: why of course, they have to keep fighting SOMEWHOW
<Gold_Demona> And MewTwo moved to Cerulean Cave
<rdibp> AND NOT A SINGLE LESSON WAS LEARNED THAT DAY!!! :[
<smelt> in the commentary they said they wanted that forget thing to happen in the cinema,so that people would buy it again and again
<Ponymon-Anarchy> what did he do
<Obsidian> and so they learned absolutly nothing
<Ponymon-Anarchy> reset time?
*Dark92Enigma Dear Princess Celestia........I didn't learn anything
<Ponymon-Anarchy> WE MUST STOP TIME!
<cowvarkian> lolwut smelt
<Gold_Demona> And then they made Cide
<Gold_Demona> r
<Dark_Horst> brock, dont you mean "see one"?
<alexxm> so they just wiped it from they're memories
<BladedWings> eeyup
<AJIsAwesome> yep
<smelt> did she just say 'look its america!'?
<ArcherJoe11> Ash never found out he died
<rdibp> alexxm: its like this movie never happend
<Meanwhile> Dear Princess Celestia, it's raining and I'm hungry. That's all I got out of the last hour, your faithful animal abuser, Ash Ketchup.
*Snow dear princess celestia, today i had a inception moment.
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: :D

<Gold_Demona> Meanwhile: :D
<smelt> ho-oh

<AJIsAwesome> Maybe you're an idiot, Misty. :P

<CrimsonPhoenix> this isn't the most emotional Charizard moment
<rdibp> :O
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03BURNNN
<Dark92Enigma> this was even more heartbreaking, but not as Pikachu's moment
<Buytoast> goddamn
<CrimsonPhoenix> That scene when Charizard is weak and Ash has to take care of him is better
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Mine was when Charizard was frozen.
<ArcherJoe11> I love how Charizard is still considered Ash's strongest Pokemon.
<Gold_Demona> Obsidian: Oh yeah, that's right. He let it go IMMEDIATELY after it evolved!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yeah AJIsAwesome that one
<rdibp> is ash's hat always over his eyes when a pokemon leaves?
<smelt> and now>ASH RUNS LIKE A GIRRRRL

<Panda> Where are you going Ass?

<Snow> oh...my god....
<ArcherJoe11> I loved the Orange Island Arc of Pokemon.
<Whiskra> Ash really had a "leave my pokémon, they'll do much better without me" syndrome during first gen
<Dark_Horst> Scoot-Scootaloo: he got frozen in a fight, i think, and they had to that him up and prevent him from dying of hypothermia
<Snow> my tears, THEY RETURNED!

<AceAttorneyEdge> This is somewhat epic.
<killerpony7733> Can't make out the what's the song about unless you give me the lyrics for example'
<Ghost_Nappa> !!!!
<Lil_B> killerpony7733 He's basicly singing about Midnight, how people are afraid of it, how Midnight is gonna get you, that there is no escape etc

<Sapsin> The original dragon ball z sucks compared to abridged
<Angel_Umbreon> 13clowns are cool because they make balloon animals :D
<AJIsAwesome> Cool.
<Reikim> Meanwhile: Dat's the joke. Also Zarbon has a girlfriend.

<Bronysith> Sapsin: thats not a real comparison
<Sapsin> Bronysith: It's a valid argument
<Sapsin> Bronysith: And it's logically sound
<Viri> 14balloons are cool

<CK|Catnap> Reikim: Magic
<AJIsAwesome> I like DBZ AND DBZA both equally.
<Ghost_Nappa> from his blood
<Nyst> So how many special task forces does Frieza have anyway?
<Kandarihu> Reikim, the cloth was soaked in blood
<Obsidian> Reikim: Its soaked in his friends blood
<AJIsAwesome> Plus DBZA is a parody, not an actual show.
<Ponyloverforever> i will still vist bronystate though and watch mlp fim
<Sapsin> DBZ has as much entertainment as a lobster.
<TheMaster> freiza runs a massive empire, so probably a lot
<Reikim> Kandarihu: But it was only semi-soaked before. Then suddenly it was fully soaked.

<Cades> thx :p
<Kimori> I think the channels finally setup the way it shouldive been before
<Caramel> 2,14 why does everyone think he's doctor whooves
<thelonepony> thats caramel
<AceAttorneyEdge> Pretty sure that's Caramel.
<Caramel> 2,14 that's getting really frustrating -_-
<Kimori> Don't have to worry about those spammers anymore
<Blako> wb
<EpicMario50> cuz he is dr whooves
<Meanwhile> Probably because Caramel is so background most people don't know who he is.
<Caramel> 2,14 sigh
<AceAttorneyEdge> It's his name!
<thelonepony> dr whooves has brown fur
<Cades> what spammers?
<Reikim> They're confusing them because they are ignorant and clearly cannot see that he lacks a time turner symbol.
<EpicMario50> gasp new pony
<EpicMario50> dr whooves
<Caramel> 2,14 THAT is dr whooves
<Reikim> Really, Caramel looks NOTHING like Tennant. I don't see why you'd confuse the two.
<Kimori> Oh sorry, I can't remember who was with me when we had a bunch of bots coming in here to spam another irc server :/
<AceAttorneyEdge> Now he brings up the camparison
<Meanwhile> ...now kiss.
<Caramel> 2,14 completely different color tone and hair style
<EpicMario50> wow i was confused :O
<Nyst> See? That brown is totally not the same brown as that other brown. it's much less brown.
<EpicMario50> ima idiot
<Nyst> Ten more seconds and someone would have made a slashfic of the two.
<EpicMario50> dun dun duuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
<EpicMario50> ikr
<Cades> yeah i was there :p
<Meanwhile> dat crest of Lordaeron.
<AceAttorneyEdge> Easy way to remember it: It's the guy's name too.
<Kimori> oh so it was you :P
<Nyst> The 'L' always looked like a 'P' to me.
<EpicMario50> wuts da pony sleeping :S
<Meanwhile> Oh hey Medivh.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dr Whooves?
<EpicMario50> no not whooves
<CrimsonPhoenix> Do you guys mean Time Turner?
<Caramel> 2,14 rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
<EpicMario50> its another pony
<otakon> hiya Caramel
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: no that's Doctor Hooves
<EpicMario50> no
<EpicMario50> ask caremel
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: his OFFICIAL Hasbro name is Doctor Hooves
<CrimsonPhoenix> Time Turner
<otakon> NO
<otakon> HOOVES GODDAMMIT
<CrimsonPhoenix> That's not what it says on the card
<EpicMario50> no not whooves
<otakon> ...
<CrimsonPhoenix> little fanboy mind
<otakon> THAT CARD IS OLD
<otakon> goddammit where is that article?
<Kimori> So swaffy seems to miss the crowd here?
<CrimsonPhoenix> is it about welovefine?
<CrimsonPhoenix> welovefine is as canon as the cards
<Panda|Drawing> hm... warcraft 3?
<EpicMario50> dr whooves has a diff skin and hair color butt they doo look similar
<Meanwhile> He IS the Warchief.
<Cades> i guess
<otakon> Time Turner is a background Earth pony with an hourglass cutie mark. The character's fan-given name, Doctor Whooves, was for a time adopted by the show's crew,[1] and only later was the character explicitly given the name "Time Turner" in a 2012 set of trading cards. Between the cards' BronyCon pre-release and hobby store release, Hasbro notified one of their licensors, Mighty Fine, that the character is named Dr. Hooves.​
<CrimsonPhoenix> that tutorial
<Kimori> and who was IStilllikeSpyro?
<Panda|Drawing> Lyra said, "Fuck yo nightmares!"
<Kimori> I thought he was swaffy
<otakon> you want a link too?
<Cades> idk

<otakon> Pink3: hell no
<Meanwhile> A Gnoll? Hogger...
<CK|Catnap> Since I'm a thrall, I can sense gnolls!
<Pink3> aw
<otakon> Meanwhile: oh God not Hogger
<EpicMario50> ok im wrong again
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, as you copy pasted
<Cades> i havent seen istilllikespyro here though
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: yes?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Mighty fine is as canon as the cards
<Kimori> Its possible he/she could be under a different name
<Meanwhile> Hogger, Hogger everywhere.
<Cades> yeah maybe
<Kimori> Well regardless...hopefully we will see him/her soon
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah and if you freaking READ it it say Hasbro changed his name to friggin' Dr. Hooves
<AceAttorneyEdge> Tutorial voice is satisfying.
<CrimsonPhoenix> the only TRUE way to officially say its name to be true
<otakon> MURLOCKS!
<CrimsonPhoenix> is in blindbags
<otakon> MRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrr
<MadSurge> Murlocs!
<Cades> yup for sure
<Meanwhile> I hate murlocs.
<otakon> WHo doesn't?
<MadSurge> Arrrrghblharblablabarrhh
<otakon> is the better question
<Kimori> so what was this thing about a locker earlier?
<Meanwhile> Nerubians?
<Spectrum_Rush> otakon: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/07/doctor-whooves-officially-named-dr.html theres your link , but heres another http://www.aggrogate.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/doctorwhoovescard.jpg, the card and the anoucement of Doctor Hooves are onlyaround 10 days apart
<MadSurge> Those who don't play Warcraft
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's still no true name for that BG Pony
<Meanwhile> Ogres are thick. Bloody annoying in Dire Maul though.
<NinjaPony> WTH
<NinjaPony> why is my password invalid
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lyra Heartstring got her name official because of Blindbag
<NinjaPony> this is my account goddamn it lol
<Cades> oh haha
<EpicMario50> lyra dont care bout fighting:D
<Blako> you mean 36Stilllikespyro36? he is member of spyroforum, I think he said he will visit this chat some day
<NinjaPony> fightclub
<Moopy> Hmp dem hints
<AceAttorneyEdge> Lyra has been onscreen for like 90% of this stream. :P
<Cades> for whatever reason theres just this one locker, just sitting around and people always move it around and put it in front of doors and stuff
<Cades> yeah blako he did
<Kimori_mobile> we were trying to figure out if istilllikespyro used another name here.
<EpicMario50> lyra swims im grass
<ArcherJoe11> Ah, the only real last Game set in Warcraft-verse.
<Meanwhile> Bloody Burning Legion.
<Meanwhile> Corrupting our land, slaughtering our innocents, humping our trees...
<ArcherJoe11> WoW is non-Canon as far as I am concerned. Arthas is still good? He gave his soul for Power. WILLINGLY!!!
<Chimera> First one is amazing
<Meanwhile> "WoW is non-canon" No matter how much you wish, that'll never be true.
<Moopy> Acheivment unlock victory
<EpicMario50> lyra is lyra
<ArcherJoe11> Meanwhile: WoW is too STUPID to be canon.
<Meanwhile> But alas, it still is.
<EpicMario50> click it
<EpicMario50> click it good
<drf|work> http://imgur.com/gallery/w27Wt <- OK wow
<ArcherJoe11> Lyra, Level 10 Seapony. She does Harmony Damage (Chaos Damage*2)
<EpicMario50> for honor
<Moopy> i think i used to play that game back then i don't remember playing it though
<EpicMario50> brb
<otakon> those quotes
<otakon> are SO wrong
<otakon> SO VERY WRONG
<Meanwhile> I love the joke lines.
<Ponyloverforever> he does
<otakon> "Me so horn-ed, me hurt you long time."
<Moopy> :D
<otakon> "Stop touching me, me not that kind of orc!"
<Meanwhile> "I said a bow string not a G...*sigh* nevermind."
<Sonic> hi?
<Nyst> Let's get on with it. Dabu. I am the warchief.
<EpicMario50> for honor
<Cades> IStillLikeSpyro said hes gone on here a few times, but nobody was here. I don't know if that was before or after it started coming back.
<Dovah> wuzzup everypony?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Dovah :)
<Wirisme> Hi Dovah
<Moopy> so thats the human base and the other base is the orc base i guess?
<Applejack2011> hi
<Blako> I think it was a long time ago he was here before, but I am not sure
<AJIsAwesome> hi Dovah :)
<Ponies47> Sup Dovah
<Dovah> chats kinda ded huh?
<otakon> it's a Monday
<Cades> Yeah probably
<otakon> that's why
<Applejack2011> revives chat
<MadSurge> Uuuh
<otakon> school, work
<otakon> that sort of thing
<Moopy> Teh school work please
<Dovah> well my opinion of school got a little better today, they gave away a shit ton of free muffins
<Moopy> lucky
<Applejack2011> 5000 users tonight liarjack
<AJIsAwesome> I hate Tuesdays.
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind Mondays.
<CK|Catnap> So I just had a thought
<Cades> You're making a game blako?
<CK|Catnap> And see if you follow me on this one
<rdibp> i found out the same voice for Prince Blueblood is Iron Will :O
<rdibp> btw hai :3
<Moopy> I hate most of the days except Friday.....Friday is my best day ever
<rdibp> thank Celestia for rashashana
<AJIsAwesome> Alright, ready.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Haiya rdibp :)
<Applejack2011> hi
<CK|Catnap> Okay, first point: EA announces that they are proud of the fact that they have not greenlit any games that are exclusively single player, citing that they want to implement multi-player functionality in every franchise they own in some format, be it Facebook apps or full MMO status.
<Blako> yeah, I am making one application and one game, the game is called Sparx the dragonfly
<CK|Catnap> Second point: They just officially confirmed that Dragon Age 3 is being developed.
<Shizuka> 13so EA is in full on death spiral mode
<CK|Catnap> Let those two sink in for a moment.
<Shizuka> 13yay
<AJIsAwesome> Wow........
<CK|Catnap> You KNOW what that has to mean.
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm.....
<Sumica> 00,10stay up till 6am sleep till 2pm well that should make me ready for graveyard shift.
<CK|Catnap> DA3 has multi-player of some sort.
<Shizuka> 13bioware has been brainwashed?
<Meanwhile> EA has done away with all pretense and just announced their plans of chaos?
<Blako> it is still in the beginning, but I have everything prepared... I just need some 3D models to make it look like a game :D
<Dovah> Dragon age is good game
<Cades> Awesome :p
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Better take out the trash. At night.
<CK|Catnap> Now what KIND of multiplayer, that's unclear. But if their prior statement is to be believed....then DA3 has to have it.
<Sumica> 00,10for a company that is dieing they sure seem to be making alot of games still Shizuka
<AJIsAwesome> CK|Catnap: Hmm, seems interesting.
<Blako> then I can make 3D collisions and then it will be easy
<Dovah> CK|Catnap: da3 release?
<Bronysith> Shizuka: Bioware was indoctrinated by the rEApers
<otakon> Shizuka: they got absorbed by EA
<CK|Catnap> Whether it's just stupid Facebook apps or full blown multiplayer, or god forbid, they pulled a C&C and ripped out its soul to incorporate it into the MMO fleet they're building
<Bronysith> otakon: ninjaed
<Moopy> Cheater!
<Shizuka> 13ea desperately wants a slice of the world of warcraft pie
<otakon> CK|Catnap: there is going to be MP in DA3.
<CK|Catnap> Yeah, mull that one around in your head for a moment, Dragon Age Online
<otakon> Shizuka: not really that
<Shizuka> 13let their hubris kill them
<Bronysith> Shizuka: they want everyones pie
<otakon> CK|Catnap: argh
<Derp_Derp> bronysith I see wat u did thar
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...Jamieson Price does a voice in this?
<Dark_Horst> just wait for it, they're gonna pull their f2p, p2w bullshit on DA3 too
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight people
*Dovah wonders how TES: Online will turn out
<otakon> They want to goddamn "broaden the demographic" for EVER GODDAMN GAME THEY'RE COMING OUT WITH
<Meanwhile> King Terenas Menethil.
<otakon> you can't DO THAT
<CK|Catnap> Sure you can!
<Blako> I also thought about multiplayer, but it would be quite difficult, because I would have to learn some stuff about udp, and how to manage it
<otakon> it makes it too goddamn thin
<SaxyPretender> 0,14deerip, not Jamieson Price, Michael McConnohie
<Cades> yeah
<CK|Catnap> Just make Dead Space 3 not scary, Dragon Age 3 into a button masher, and C&C into an MMO
<Sumica> 00,10shenaganins, humans cant be druids
<Nyst> More Money!
<CK|Catnap> And then, for the next game, we can make them all the same game!
<Bronysith> Sumica: cata
<otakon> CK|Catnap: and then the game is no longer what it was supposed to be.
<CK|Catnap> Dragon Space 4: Command and Conquer Edition.
<Cades> Is there anything I can help you with that requires no skill? :p
<otakon> CK|Catnap: stop that!
<Sumica> 00,10the king is still alive, this is not cata
<Dark_Horst> otakon: he has a point
<otakon> At least we'll still have Obsidian and XCOM: UFO Defense
<Shizuka> 13on a more positive note
<Kimori> beta testing? heh
<otakon> Dark_Horst: true
<Nyst> Just Command edition. Conquer is the DLC.
<Shizuka> 13torchlight 2 in three days
<otakon> Shizuka: ture
<CK|Catnap> Nope. It's my job to terrify you. :D
<otakon> XCOM!
<otakon> WHO IS GETTING IT?
<Cades> Cuz idk how to animate, model, texture or anything like that :p
<Meanwhile> Torchlight. Eh, was ok.
<Shizuka> 13on a more positive more positive note, black mesa
<Meanwhile> Meeeeeh.
<CK|Catnap> Am looking forward to TL2, since I've heard that it's better than D3 and cheaper to boot.
<Sumica> 00,10oh is gaben freman gonna lose some weight and learn how to jumpgood?
<Meanwhile> When did remakes become a good thing.
<CK|Catnap> But still gonna wait for official reviews anyways.
<Nyst> I'm looking forward to XCOM, but not enough to preorder it. I really wish there was a demo or something I could try.
<DerpDash> Hey Everypony! :)
<ChangelingCherry> CHANGELING!
<ChangelingCherry> Derp_Derp: Hallow! O3O
<Sumica> 00,10heh, I peed on that guys grave
<thelonepony> hi DerDash
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DerpDash :)
<otakon> Shizuka: lol
<ChangelingCherry> DerpDash: Hallow! O3O
<otakon> hiya Arthas
<alexxm> how are things DerpDash
<CK|Catnap> Meanwhile: I'd say roughly about the time that Nintendo re-released OoT for the tenth time. And then all the XBox fans said "lol Nintendo sux" and rushed out to go buy Halo 1, now with HD paint.
<Moopy> hahahahahahahahah oh sumica your funny dude
<Shizuka> 13http://fav.me/d5f3usi
<otakon> before you went all evil like
<Blako> :D don't know, maybe some Ideas later, or testing compatibility on Mac and windows, bc I use Linux (don't worry, I use multiplatform libraries)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<DerpDash> alexxm: Great! Got back from school
<otakon> CK|Catnap: yeah but Halo hadn't been remade 20 times before really
<otakon> Seriously
<CK|Catnap> otakon: Give it time
<otakon> EVER GODDAMN ZELDA IS THE SAME
<Cades> sure
<otakon> I mean I LOVE the Zelda series don't get me wrong
<CK|Catnap> Yeah I'd happily argue against that.
<Meanwhile> CK|Catnap: Good point.
<MadSurge> otakon: and super mario game, yes :D
<otakon> yeah
<CK|Catnap> The ones that are samey are generally the handhelds, which (unsurprisingly) I don't like much.
<otakon> Elemental based dungeons? check
<Meanwhile> And to be fair, it's a remake made by modders as opposed to the actual company (afaik)
<otakon> tool that you get in every dungeon that lets you continue on
<CK|Catnap> But the console ones have generally been decently differentiated, at least to some degree.
<Meanwhile> But actually, that's also kind of worse.
<otakon> also a 3/7 Dungeon system
<Blako> the development was fast in summer holidays, but now it is school, so it is quite slow
<Meanwhile> It sends out the impression that the fans just want the same thing over and over instead of something new.
<CK|Catnap> otakon: That's like saying every FPS is the same because they all feature guns and you're expected to hide behind walls and shoot at people before they shoot you first.
<otakon> 3 beginner dungeons, you hit the mid boss then 7 dungeons then final boss
<CK|Catnap> ....oh wait.
<CK|Catnap> I c wut u did thar.
<Blako> can't wait for some holiday :D
<Cades> I know me too :p
*drf|work sighs
<otakon> you do? Good.
<CK|Catnap> But no srsly.
<Kimori> Its not too far away
<Cades> I haven't played Spyro in a whole week cuz I've been so busy with school :O
<otakon> Now that doesn't mean that the games are lousy by any means
<Kimori> Its been way longer for me
<Dark_Horst> damn arthas, you evil
<Cades> :(
<CK|Catnap> The differentiation between a given pair of Zeldas is probably larger than any other sequel out there. Except for direct sequels like the New Mario Bros Wii U shit, because that's pretty much blatant C/P.
<otakon> So, a Paladin and a couple of Warriors?
<Dovah> timmeh!
<Kimori> Lots of family stuff going on :/
<otakon> CK|Catnap: OoT and MM
<otakon> are their elemental dungeons?
<otakon> yes
<Barbetos|AtWork> Quests.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Lets make an MMO with NO QUESTS
<otakon> oh nvm
<Cades> That sucks :/
<Barbetos|AtWork> And you just have to figure it out.
<Blako> I played it about 2 months ago when there was the competetion "collect as less gems as possible", but the competition somehow... ended
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh wait. Thats called Darkfall.
<Sumica> 00,10oh god that face
<Dovah> what game is this anyway?
<otakon> Barbetos|AtWork: there is a Zombie MMO coming out like that
<Sumica> 00,10kilitkillitkillit
<Blako> (on spyroforum)
<DerpDash> Sumica Dat voice
<CK|Catnap> otakon: Mechanically, the two are actually significantly different, despite being built on the same engine. OoT and MM are the example of how to do sequels RIGHT, not a bad thing. >_>
<otakon> Dovah: it's Warcraft 2
<otakon> ahem 3
<Barbetos|AtWork> otakon it is out. It is called Day Z =P
<Dark_Horst> Dovah: warcraft 3
<Sumica> 00,10Dovah, it's warcraft 3
<otakon> Barbetos|AtWork: no there is another one
<Dovah> i see
<Cades> i lost the game :/
<otakon> it's called War Z
<otakon> or *ahem* The War Z
<ArcherJoe11> Dovah: the last real Warcraft
<otakon> based off of the novel I think
<Blako> :(
<Blako> it is better to keep it backuped on pc
<Kimori> which one?
<CK|Catnap> The way to do sequels WRONG is to release the same game with one extra element added, and then to have sports people show up on stage and claim in terribly scripted lines how it's "just like playing the sport for reals dawg"
<Cades> I wish I could've did that though
<twilight_sprinkle> ooh, warcraft 3, long time no see
<alexxm> i thought it was world war z otakon
<Dark_Horst> looked like a dayz/l4d crossover to me
<Cades> It's called the game
<otakon> CK|Catnap: you mean like Dragon Age 2?
<CK|Catnap> I'
<Sumica> 00,10heh, suddnly thinking of "wrath of the couch potato"
<otakon> I can't even force myself to play through it
<Sumica> 00,10they sum up all of warcraft 3 in 30 seconds
<otakon> Also GODDAMMIT THE FUCKED UP THE ONLY FUCKING DWARF IN THE GODDAMN GAME
<sagas> Fuck yo farm!
<otakon> Varric is dwarf
<CK|Catnap> *I'd say DA2 is more like an example of how to do sequels TERRIBLE by taking what people liked and throwing it in a waste bin, then making a generic hack-and-slash instead.
<otakon> Dwarves are partially resistant to magic
<Blako> I have to go now, need some sleep for tomorow school :D
<Blako> so bye
<otakon> Varric has no magic resistance what so ever
<Kimori> cyas
<Cades> cya
<otakon> Bullshit Bioware
<otakon> Simple goddamn bullshit
<Shizuka> 13we can't give the sword of a thousand truths to a NOOB
*sagas doesnt know what game this is
<Meanwhile> we can't quote South Park when it's not on the STREAM.
<otakon> Shizuka: lol but it's the only thing that can kill that which has no life!
*sagas or who's playing it
<slavianka> #pirates-of-equestria i need some rpers!
<Thrackerzod> hey look warcraft 3
<otakon> Meanwhile: yes we can ...BEEFCAKE!
<otakon> slavianka: no advertising
<twilight_sprinkle> that tent is way past redemption
<Meanwhile> No advertising other channels in here slavianka.
<slavianka> FAAACK!
<Meanwhile> Bonk.
<otakon> did he get kicked?
<otakon> or did he just leave?
<otakon> I don't think he knew
<twilight_sprinkle> i think its a she
<Sumica> 00,10kicked
<otakon> ah
<CK|Catnap> But yeah, thought I would share. Now we wait to hear how DA3 has implemented multiplayer.
<Dark_Horst> advertising and then screaming obsceneties in capslock does not make you look good
<Sumica> 00,10oh right embeded chat dont have conectings and parts any more
<CK|Catnap> And the subsequent screams of terror.
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: indeed not
<otakon> Dark_Horst: true but I don't think they realized the no advertising rule of THIS particular channel or forget.
<Sumica> 00,10I think that was done for every ones sanity during new eps
<Dark_Horst> CK|Catnap: probably f2p open world with pay to win mode
<CK|Catnap> And I would join them but I'm too busy digging a grave for C&C
<CK|Catnap> So I can cry at it.
<Moopy> Hey sumica can i ask you a only question and be honest ok
<ChangelingCherry> TIMMY! WE HERE TO SAVE YOU!! WHERE ARE YOU??
<otakon> CK|Catnap: from the looks of things it's probably gonna be like ME3's model
<Sumica> 00,10glad to see arthus geting an early start on his 100kills
<Shizuka> 13LIE
<Shizuka> 13LIE YOUR PLOT OFF
<Thrackerzod> sheep
<otakon> NOT THE SHEEP!
<otakon> WHY!?
<Thrackerzod> :3
<twilight_sprinkle> lolwut
<Shizuka> 13sheep are the seat of power for any kingdom
<Shizuka> 13duh
<Kencolt> That HAS to have been Goblin Tech.
<Meanwhile> Quite literally if you line the throne with wool.
<Dark_Horst> exploding sheep.... WORMS DID THAT
<Thrackerzod> yes murder all the townies
<Dark_Horst> we have tiny pink infiltrators
<twilight_sprinkle> kill villagers, ignore orcs
<Sumica> 00,10So you gonna ask or should i just pick a answer
<Shizuka> 13say no! whatever he wants say no!
<Dark_Horst> wu?
<Moopy> Do you guys hate my username?
<DerpDash> its epic Moopy
<Shizuka> 13yes it fills me with uncontrollable rage every time it appears on my screen
<Kimori> I still think we are off to a good start
<Moopy> I can go change it to something else
<Dark_Horst> i'm practically foaming
<Dark_Horst> scratch that, i AM FOAMING!
<Meanwhile> I'm fine with your username.
<AJIsAwesome> Hm?
<Meanwhile> I hate you though.
<AJIsAwesome> What's going on?
<AJIsAwesome> What's with all the hate?
<Cades> yeah i do too
<Moopy> Wow meanwhile thats really untouching though
<Meanwhile> You've stepped into an alternate uniberse.

<Dark_Horst> Caramel: why i can see why, i'm gonna proceed to jackhammer it out of my head anyway

<CrimsonPhoenix> Fluttershy?
