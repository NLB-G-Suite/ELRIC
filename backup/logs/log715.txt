<AJIsAwesome> TheBadger: http://pinkie.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw4548-applejack_jimmies_aint_rustled.jpg
<Dj_Cyber-4G> NUT THE POKEMANS ARE FUCKING WEIRD AS HELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY CAME OUT OF THE DEEPEST PITS OF NEW JERSEY
<TheBadger> There are 252 pokemon. That is it. If you think there are more, you're fucking retarded.
<DWR_TF2> Well
<Jmo> Badger laying it down.
<Snow> for me there are 493
<DWR_TF2> I'm retarded then.
<DWR_TF2> Because to me, there are over 600.
<Rex_Mundi> What there neads to be is an open sandbox Zombie game, where its like you trying out your zombie plan in a video game. Not a 'shoot hoards of zombies' game.
<AJIsAwesome> You're going to have to try harder than that, Badger. :P
<TheBadger> AT least you understand that you are wrong.
<Dken2021> Rex_Mundi interesting
<AJIsAwesome> At least you understand that you can't accept other poeple's opinions. :D
<Snow> aaaand
<Dj_Cyber-4G> .... Rex_Mundi like Project Zomboid?
<Snow> it went PvP
<AJIsAwesome> *people's
<TheBadger> Oh, I accept other people's opinions, that just have to understand that they are wrong.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> Check out Project Zomboid
<Mega_Milk> -lol god I love pipe bombs in l4d.
<AJIsAwesome> It was a nice attempt to rustle my jimmies, but you're going to have to do better than that.
<Snow> TAAAAAAAANK
<Snow> sounds familliar
<Jmo> Ayejay is stoopid
<Jmo> jimmies b rustled
<AJIsAwesome> Shush, Jaymoo. :D
<Rex_Mundi> Dken2021: Imagine, your character is getting supplies for your zombie hide out in a house, or you put stuff into a backpack and trek across the land looking for safty
<Jmo> :>
<Mega_Milk> Jmo: dafaq did you just say....
<DWR_TF2> Joomay is stoopider
<Mega_Milk> Jmo: Oh that aj...
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Jmo> nahp
<Jmo> chav is
<TheBadger> No need to rustle Jimmies when im on the correct team. It's like the American army going against an ant. The ant might still disagree, but who cares.
<DWR_TF2> Chav in college
<DWR_TF2> prove he has smarts
<Jmo> College my ass.
<DWR_TF2> Sounds like a nice college

<DWR_TF2> "It's my opinion therefore I am right, you are wrong."
<Snow> id like to see that they accidently hit a witch
<Mega_Milk> HavokOC: Man versus Machine.
<TheBadger> No, im not implying, im stating the absolute fact that his opinion is wrong, AJ
<AJIsAwesome> DWR_TF2: Makes sense to me. :P
<DWR_TF2> Let me see.
<HavokOC> Mega_Milk, I know what MvM is :P
<AJIsAwesome> Try harder, Badger. :P
<Stormy> Just got home
<DWR_TF2> The company behind Pokemon made the game, correct?

<TheBadger> The company behind the recent "Sonic" games made the recent sonic games, right?
<Mega_Milk> HavokOC: Oh sorry -lol I thought you were asking what it was :3
<Jmo> Dis gun b gud.
<AJIsAwesome> You remind me of those "genwunners", Badger. :D
<Rex_Mundi> Too many zombie games are just run-n-gun shoot everything action games, even resident evil has become this. Where is the survival horror I ask you?
<Snow> just a question about this game
<DWR_TF2> We're not talking about Soonac, we're talking about Pokeymonz.
<TheBadger> doesn't make them any more sonic games that a FF game is a dragon warrior game
<Kimori> yay
<Snow> how did those zombies apearred in the first place?
<Jmo> medical outbreak.
<AJIsAwesome> Snow: Plot convenience! :P
<NullRadix> magical zombie fairies

<Jmo> Like every damn zombie apocalypse.

<TheBadger> exatly
<TheBadger> *exactly
<Stormy> now I can not think about RoR and Cucumber for... a few hours. XD
<AJIsAwesome> Still not changing my opinion about the gens. :P

<AJIsAwesome> shadowboy8456: Don't forget the Mario debacle, too. :D
<TheBadger> still not changing the fact thjat I dont need to change an uncorrect opinion

<Stormy> Yeah, it's the testing thing we're using
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Mega_Milk> god I hate the witch >:3
<Mega_Milk> Tricking you with her crying
<Lil_B> Hi everyone :)
<shadowboy8456> teool zoey
<Jmo> Ayejay shoosh, u r stewpid.
<Dken2021> hey Lil_B
<TheBadger> AJ, the difference is that im not stating an opinion, im stating a FACT
<LunasGuard> ello Lil_B
<AJIsAwesome> Don't we all, Mega_Milk? :D
<shadowboy8456> troll
<Mega_Milk> Lil_B: Sup.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Lil_B. :)
<Stormy> Dumbest syntax ever and makes everything take twice as long
<Jmo> :3
<Alchemist> Hi Lil_B !
<DWR_TF2> Um, no you're not, TheBadger.
<AJIsAwesome> You're stating what YOU consider a fact, Badger. :D
<TheBadger> Um, yes I am, DWR
<Lil_B> thanks Dken2021 LunasGuard Mega_Milk AJIsAwesome and Alchemist :)
<DWR_TF2> I could easily go onto the official pokemon website and prove you that you're wrong.
<Stormy> I guess it's supposed to be used for letting your customers get involved in the development process, but it confuses me and I'm a programmer, so...
<TheBadger> No, im stating something that has been an absolute in the pokemon community since 2001. AKA a fact
<Snow> dayum
<Lil_B> aww, L4D2... I would like to play with them
<AJIsAwesome> Ah, another Pokemon fan that's stuck in the past. :D
<DWR_TF2> Um, no.
<Snow> shizu would be an awsome snoiper on tf2
<TheBadger> um, yes
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Aprons and Cookbooks!
<Mega_Milk> AJIsAwesome: I swear my first time playing i heard a crying girl and though "Oh ma gerd, someone needs help and is still not infected!" Andran all the way over to find her and the jerk attacked me!!
<shadowboy8456> brb,doing ultimate gamer challenge
<Kimori> More work for you then :/
<Rex_Mundi> Since we are talking about pokemon. http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MPdof2XKL._SL500_AA300_.jpg
<Dken2021> yep, that happened
<Stormy> Yep.
<DWR_TF2> AJIsAwesome Yeah, we'll always come across these type of people.
<Stormy> I can
<Stormy> *can't wait until this class is over
<AJIsAwesome> Well, seeing how some Pokemon were based off piles of gunk, pokeballs, sunflowers and etc. in Gen 1 and 2 doesn't really help your case Badger. :D
<Dken2021> aprons? I'd totally get those, the epitone of manliness
<Stormy> Only another month and a half...
<TheBadger> Guys, it's just an OPINION that murder is wrong. Obviously, that makes someone who states that it is wrong just another opinion
<Jmo> I'm seriously wondering what the fuck you are gaining out of this.
<Stormy> I'm going to get a terrible grade though because the professor can tell how much I don't like it >.>
<AJIsAwesome> Muk, based off piles of gunk. Electrode, based off a POKEBALL. Sunflora, based off a SUNFLOWER. Originality, what's that?
<DWR_TF2> Joomay Entertainment.
<DWR_TF2> :>
<Jmo> Not you chav.
<Snow> i dont even know where this conversation is about.
<TheBadger> Enjoyment that there are people dumb enough to think that there are more than 2 gehns of pokemon
<Rex_Mundi> I stoped watching pokemon when they started introducing new pokemon. I remember the exact episode I stoped watching, it was the episode where they are in the woods and some guy who makes pokeballs out of acorns and stuff.
<TheBadger> I mean, you have to be INSANELY dumb to think that
<Dken2021> I'd hate to have even started this conversation
<DWR_TF2> When there are...
<Jmo> Logic flew out the wnidow.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm enjoying the fact that you seem that your opinions and beliefs are higher than everyone else's. :D
<Lil_B> Rex_Mundi funny, last year, there was an article in a german Newspaper saying "Hacker Group , blah blah blah, with a blue Pokemon" and a picture of Rainbow Dash next to it :/
<Kimori> Is it going to screw up your graduation plan?
<Jmo> window*
*NullRadix popcorns
<AJIsAwesome> NullRadix: Pass the popcorn? :3
<Stormy> not unless I get below a C
<Snow> not only logic Jmo
*Snow throws herself out the window
<Rex_Mundi> Lil_B: Obviously rainbow Dash is best Pokemon.
<Jmo> D:
*NullRadix shrugs, passes the popcorn and goes back to his work
<AJIsAwesome> I'm laughing about this. My jimmies aren't even rustled. :D
<TheBadger> It's funny, im not TOO suproised by the stupidity, considering there are even people who refuse to believe the holocaust happened
<Lil_B> Rex_Mundi appearently so xD
<Stormy> I hope I won't do that badly though because apparently last year there was a guy who got away with basically doing nothing in that class and still got a C
<DWR_TF2> Wow.
<DWR_TF2> You really have to bring that up when we're discussing Pokemon.
<Jmo> Are you American TheBadger?
*Panda|Drawing holds Snow
*LunasGuard is playing with black magic
<Snow> O.o
<Kimori> wtf...
<Snow> PANDA!
<AJIsAwesome> You go from Pokemon to the Holocaust? I thought we were talking about Pokemon.
<Panda|Drawing> Snow, do not defenstrate yourself, okies?
*Snow glomps Panda|Drawing
<Kimori> How does he expect to get a job in that field then..
<AJIsAwesome> THe Holocaust had nothing to with this. :P
<TheBadger> Well yeah, you have to be just as retarded and closed to the world to believe that there are more than 2 gens
<Panda|Drawing> ^^
<Panda|Drawing> how are you hun?
<Snow> pretty good
<Stormy> It's called senioritis :P basically everyone stops caring about school when they get to their final year
<Snow> and you?
<Dken2021> know what? let TheBadger belive what he belives, there's no reason at all to belittle him of it
<AJIsAwesome> And you have to be ignorant and closeminded to believe that there are 5 OFFICIAL generations of Pokemon. :D
<Stormy> Probably won't help him much in the job hunt though... =/
<Dken2021> or argue about it
<Panda|Drawing> hehe ^^ pretty good, just glancing into the chat to rest my eyes xD
<AJIsAwesome> Dken2021: I'm not belittling, I'm just explaining my side.
<TheBadger> agreed AJ.
<TheBadger> finally you see reason
<AJIsAwesome> *that there AREN'T
<Lil_B> ohey Panda|Drawing !
<Panda|Drawing> Lil_B ^^ hello there! How are you :3
<TheBadger> Now that AJ has agreed with me, time to leave.
<Rex_Mundi> I think this discussion should be why ash hasnt aged, or why the show.
<DWR_TF2> Good
<DWR_TF2> pls go
<Kimori> Yeah probably not
<AJIsAwesome> Well, that happened. :D
<Lil_B> Panda|Drawing so far so good :) and you?
<Panda|Drawing> O_O did I come back to a fight?
<DWR_TF2> Make that, Joomay, u go 2
<DWR_TF2> pls
<AJIsAwesome> Panda|Drawing: A pointless fight, at that. :P
<Jmo> How about you go roll in a ditch.
<Panda|Drawing> Lil_B ^^ good hehe just chillin'
<DWR_TF2> kk
<Jmo> :>
<DWR_TF2> Will do that tomorrow
<ACS13123> This game
*Panda|Drawing rolls Jmo in a ditch.
<ACS13123> I love this game
<ACS13123> So
<ACS13123> Damn
<ACS13123> Much
<Stormy> supposedly that's the reason the professor is always on our case
<Stormy> So we don't slack off like that guy did
<AJIsAwesome> There are 5 OFFICIAL gens of Pokemon. If you don't want to believe that, that's your problem. :P
<Snow> im in a good mood even thou i went through my drawing yesterday with my eraser
<Jmo> He left, shush AJ.
<DWR_TF2> He's gone, AJIsAwesome.
<AJIsAwesome> I know. :P
<Stormy> This was supposed to be a class where the students pretty much take the lead
<Jmo> Witnessing that made my brain cells suicide.
<Panda|Drawing> Snow :D what did you draw?
<AJIsAwesome> Just making a statement. :P
<DWR_TF2> Brain cells? Joomay?
<Panda|Drawing> Jmo stop smoking weed then -__-
<Stormy> but nooooo we just _have_ to do everything his way
<DWR_TF2> When did this happen?
<Jmo> You guys arguing over such a small thing.
<Jmo> Children. >_>
<Snow> my pony oc antromorphic
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: I wasn't arguing, I was explaining my argument. :D
<Panda|Drawing> Snow :D can I see?
<Dken2021> again, I'd hate to have even caused that arguement, all I wanted was some help
<AJIsAwesome> *my side of the topic
<Jmo> 'I wasn't aruging, I was explaining my argument'
<Snow> cant, went through my drawing and it got ripped
<Jmo> You didn't think that over .-.
<LunasGuard> the next l4d should have zombie kids in it
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: I changed my sentence. :P
<Panda|Drawing> Snow D: can I see your OC then? ^^
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: I don't htink before I type sometimes. Sue me. :P
<AJIsAwesome> *think
<Jmo> I will
<AJIsAwesome> See, there I go again. :D
<DWR_TF2> Joomay, you can't sue
<DWR_TF2> u can't afford a lawyer
<Snow> sure, hold on Panda
<Rex_Mundi> So you guys all have Zombie plans? Cus i have a zombie plan for my house and my school!'

<Fluttershy123> No disney cant handle MLP
<Michael> twilight_sprinkle: don't say that, or it will give them ideas!
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Bullshit. No way.
<CriticKitten> That's apparently their aimed release date.
<Rex_Mundi> twilight_sprinkle: And then turns MLP more girly and with 3X the number of princesses.
<MadSurge> SirGanjalf: inb4 HASBRO buys Disney :D
<CriticKitten> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/120408-Disney-Acquires-Lucasfilm

<Sumica> 00,10disney made plushies
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: and mickey mouse as the new princess of course
<SirGanjalf> MadSurge: WHAT A TWEEST tha would be
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, if that happened, they'd have the rights to Generation 1 again.
<Fluttershy123> Although how good of a company disney is, they have bought and ruined a couple of things
<CriticKitten> From the original source
<Rex_Mundi> ponies in kingdom hearts
<CriticKitten> "Ms. Kennedy will serve as executive producer on new Star Wars feature films, with George Lucas serving as creative consultant. Star Wars Episode 7 is targeted for release in 2015, with more feature films expected to continue the Star Wars saga and grow the franchise well into the future. "
<Meanwhile> No.
<Everlasting_Joy> :O
<GilDash|Busy> Whoa, wait, what?
<Meanwhile> No ok.
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: and bring back Megan? :D
<Meanwhile> It just can't happen like that.
<GilDash|Busy> Actual wat.
<CrimsonPhoenix> >Episode 7
<Meanwhile> You can't just...No. No. That's not a thing. I refuse. I will not accept that.
*Everlasting_Joy leaves for a minute, "There's too much wrong with all of this!"
<twilight_sprinkle> bahaha
<Sumica> 00,10hey that meens we might get good starwars again
<Fluttershy123> Who want to have a poll?
<CriticKitten> Apparently it CAN happen
<otakon> Meanwhile: it's true
<Michael> inb4 fail episode?
<dotEXE> I see your "wat" and raise a "dafuq"
<GilDash|Busy> Just... but I... if I... wat.
<CrimsonPhoenix> isn't that Jedi Academy?
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: idk, imo ep 3 was good
<CrimsonPhoenix> or something
<otakon> Sumica: ARE YOU INSANE?! Disnney make a GOOD star wars ep?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: -_-
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, I don't think Hasbro would be stupid enough to have Humans in Equestria in the main canon.
<otakon> dat roaring Tachikoma
<Meanwhile> Sumica you trust Disney to do Star Wars? What kind of pixie dust're you on?
<Rex_Mundi> Sumica- http://ponyvillegazette.com/files/2011/09/kidomo_my_little_pony_live_show_in_malls_across_canada.jpg
<CriticKitten> Sumica: Lucas's last brilliant idea was to re-re-re-*continues*-re-release the Star Wars episodes in 3D.
<GilDash|Busy> Surely Thrawn's trilogy comes after episode 6?
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: me neither
<CrimsonPhoenix> >Across Canada
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Episode 7, 8, and 9 is the Thrawn Trilogy if ya ask me
<CriticKitten> Now they're giving the series to Disney, a company that almost singlehandedly killed POWER RANGERS.
<GilDash|Busy> SpeccyRush|Drawing: Beat ya. :p
<otakon> CriticKitten: lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> OSHIT I MUST KNOW WHERE IT'LL COME HERE
<Fluttershy123> **POLL QUESTION** In a fight, with no magic or flying what pony would win?
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: ah, the infamous fat ponies
<otakon> CriticKitten: it's doomed
<Fluttershy123> In the main character 6
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> GilDash|Busy: spiderman.mp4
<otakon> Fluttershy123: AJ
<Rex_Mundi> I like the Clone wars TV show, it does Starwars better than the prequile movies does. Anakin is actually likable.
<AJIsAwesome> Fluttershy123: Any of them?
<Sumica> 00,10pony time

<SirGanjalf> OK, who asked for ponies:|
<CriticKitten> Unless the name "Jerry Bruckheimer" appears in the credits of the next Star Wars movie, it's safe to presume that it is CRAP.
<Rex_Mundi> an episode or just intro?
<GilDash|Busy> TBH, I'm interested to see what will happen if George Lucas doesn't have complete control...
<Meanwhile> Overreactions - go.
<otakon> SirGanjalf: twilight_sprinkle did
<AdamTheDuck> YYYYYEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH

<Shizuka> 13i'm not big on tower defense
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] what happened?
<Squallken> are we recommending games?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Instead of getting to safety, some people are going to the shores to WATCH the hurricane
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] would this be their first time experiencing a hurricane per chance?
<Kimori> Thats obviously with almost everything
<DeadpoolDash> lala la la
<MadSurge> Shizuka: me neither, but PvsZ is funny and simple enough to keep you going
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hell if I know
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its still stupid
<Brad_> id rather just pay monthly and have a car i dont have to worry about.
<Brad_> and get something new every few years
<ekips> SpadeMagnes[School] maybe that's their lifestyle
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[School]: maybe they just arent afraid of death
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: shhh, let the hurricane clean them up "D
<MadSurge> :D
<Kurra> dat Kurricane
<Kurra> O:3
<cachi01> wow zelda, minecraft and pokemon have their own category in the creepypasta wikia...... 80% of them must suck ass
<ekips> We don't have to care about dumb people. Just remove all warning labels from red buttons and let the problem solve itself...
<twilight_sprinkle> cashiepasta
<NullRadix> cachi01: you know there's a rule for that?
<sonicdude558> Dang I forgot to rip some Avatar dvds
<twilight_sprinkle> ekips: red buttons usually kill others.
<Dken2021> they're franchises that's adored by millions of children, of course the majority of them suck
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You know they have to put a warning on coffe cups to warn its hot?
<cachi01> creepysprunkl
<ekips> twilight_sprinkle touché
<oni_link> SpadeMagnes[School]: because people are dumb
<SpadeMagnes[School]> How stupid does one have to be to not know to put a coffee cup in your lap
<J_E_Smith71> Bronysith isn't in the chat right now is he? Wonder how he'll react to the fact that Star Wars Episode 7 is coming in 2015, and handled by someone other than Lucas
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Some dumbass sued for said issue and won SOMEHOW
<RAWRity> ninja kitties: https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/25/syNdDzUiqU2j-8tWPTX4MQ2.jpg

<Kawaii_icybeauti> BTW, I don't have school again tomorrow!!!
<J_E_Smith71> And according to the news, Disney will try to make a new Star Wars film "every two to three years"
<twilight_sprinkle> NENUDJUS: yeah i do :P
<AlienWarhead> Did Disney do anything with Marvel besides selling marvel stuff in Disney stores and make money?
<NENUDJUS> twilight_sprinkle: then who am i?
<RAWRity> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/30/LEsz--3J4kGAbD0-CMpoxA2.png

<cachi01> Disney expects to more aggressively expand the Star Wars film schedule, Iger said in a statement. Following the release of Episode 7 in 2015, "our long term plan is to release a new Star Wars feature film every two to three years," Iger said.
<NENUDJUS> twilight_sprinkle: no im still a * but iv allways wanted to be a !

<SafariMonkey> cachi01: I missed this thing, apparently disney upset star wars (or trek?) fans?
<Kimori> But I don't like the idea of always having an extra bill to pay, but instead get a car that is known for being reliable
<RAWRity> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/23/SVGrZJKRcEuAYOWyuTFhnw2.jpg

<twilight_sprinkle> NENUDJUS: this reminds me of an old cartoon about a line who fell in love with a dot

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Alrighty. Time to pick slots.
<NullRadix> Chrysalis: I've seen plenty of arguments where (once published) a work effectively becomes at least partially owned by the public. Re: edits to the original trilogy in remastered editions
<MadSurge> I can't understand the stupid pegasus' name
<Vordox> XAX: KINDA LATE NOW
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: YAY

<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: what's going on now?
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: MLP trivia in that channel and L4D stream. :3

<AJIsAwesome> "Super Sonic obatin the all moves." WUT.
<alexxm> what does it say in there SpadeMagnes[School]
<Lunar_Brony> SpadeMagnes[School] no one put any effort into the game. Why would they put effort into the manual?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> alexxm: Sonic has a energy meter
<NullRadix> Saturn: regardless, find a balance. Take time to calm down, but also take the time to fix the problems

<Colt_Brovakiin1> Ponies47: You are the sillyist filly around! :3
<Kandarihu> I wonder how the Linux community feels about Steam coming out for their platform. Last I checked, they can't trust their own computers 100% if ANYTHING closed-source is running on it, even 3D drivers. Is Linux Steam going to be open source? Or is there going to be the standard paranoia about it?
<superretroworld> Momma_Saturn: saturn is a very bad man, i order you to ground him
<Momma_Saturn> 08,01otakon: i'm 5'10, and not all that hairy

<otakon> Momma_Saturn: like I said hairy. besides, you're nearly 6 foot
<Ponies47> Momma_Saturn: Don't let them near me I will get mad and most likely go ka-boom on them. Like I did with my 3 year old cousin one time :S
<Momma_Saturn> 08,01they're always laughing with me

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Luna is best pony
<NullRadix> Kandarihu: there's all sorts in the Linux community. Plenty will simply be happy that they can play games on Linux
<Lunar_Brony> Ponies47 you think YOU'RE young? I have no job, no drivers license, and over a dozen things that I could accomplish if I were 2 years older, and even more things I only know from stories that I could have experienced myself if I were 5 years older.

<[SWAG]Haku> emangamer that is your opinion, and it's only because of the prequels, which arent as bad as people say they are.
<thisguy> i personally didnt mind the prequels tbh
<oni_link> Its fine Nittany_Discord
<emangamer> [SWAG]Haku: no, because they have squeeses every ounce of money out of the franchize possible, making ANY series bad
<[SWAG]Haku> Like Hasbro does with all of their stuff?
<emangamer> [SWAG]Haku: wrong
<emangamer> they havent done that with magic
<emangamer> or mlp
<[SWAG]Haku> Im pretty sure Im not
<[SWAG]Haku> its business
<[SWAG]Haku> get use to it
<emangamer> magic is EXTREMELY well managed
<thisguy> here's hoping hasbro dont eff thing up too much with mlp
<BaconMane> 0,5MAHGICKS
<emangamer> but then again, hasbro doesnt manage them directly
<thisguy> well, even if they do. we still have our fandom at least :)
<spud> night night everypony
<emangamer> wizards of the coast does a majority of it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01FMLE was telling me to go to bed, so later.
<NullRadix> rest well spud
<AJIsAwesome> Night, spud. :)
<thisguy> night, spud. dream of ponies tonight :)
<thelonepony> Night spud :)
<Colt_Brovakiin> Goodnight spud :)
<[SWAG]Haku> And yet the sad truth is that it's the 5th reincarnation of a kids show that was only made to promote kids toys
<Polydunami> Good night, spud and Nittany
<[SWAG]Haku> As awesome as it is
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: why does a freakishly massive and large elephant want you to go to bed.
<Polydunami> Yeah, they got lucky this time.
<oni_link> Well I gotta cut on processes while running L4D apparantly
<emangamer> [SWAG]Haku: MAGIC, perfect example of not squeesing every penny out of it
<oni_link> See you all later tonight
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't know emangamer. I guess it loves me.
<Polydunami> See you, oni_link
<emangamer> they make it because players demand it
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: why do you even have an FMLE
<[SWAG]Haku> thats because the target audience was children, and maybe us
<emangamer> those are ex[ensive
<emangamer> and they eat a lot
<Derpy_Hooves> disney just bought lucas film
<emangamer> speaking of magic
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't know, but I'm selling it.
<sonicdude558> I am back!
<thisguy> yikes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know Derpy_Hooves.
<emangamer> I'M GOING A PRO TOUR QUALIFIER THIS WEEKEND!
<Ponies47_> Derpy_Hooves: eeyup. I heard about that :/
<emangamer> fuck yeah, maybe I'll see Brad Nelson again
<[SWAG]Haku> Transformers is as good an example as MLP
<sonicdude558> Hello?
<sonicdude558> I am back :3
<emangamer> to quote the late otakon
<Meanwhile> And nothing of value was gained.
<[SWAG]Haku> It was an awesome toy line made tv show made franchise made Hit Movie Trilogy
<emangamer> GODDAMMIT DARI BOT
<Meanwhile> That was Wrek's bot.
<thisguy> damn. lucas + disney = eep? o.o
*thelonepony glomps sonicdude558 :3
<sonicdude558> Well this is odd
<otakon> I'm not late
<Polydunami> Oh dear god.
<otakon> I wasn't kicked
<sonicdude558> Thank you thelonepony
<[SWAG]Haku> Point is that Star Wars was bad ass enough to create such a long running series of stuff
<otakon> and WHO is that emangamer?
*emangamer kicks otakon
*emangamer in the shins
<thisguy> gtg. laters
<[SWAG]Haku> It's successful because people like it, and people want it
*otakon kicks emangamer in the daddybag.
<otakon> bye thisguy take care
<sonicdude558> So Saturn
<otakon> sonicdude558: Momma_Saturn
<emangamer> otakon: why do you hate my backpack my fatehr gave me?
<sonicdude558> how about them 100 plushies I gave you?
<otakon> emangamer: XD
<Polydunami> So Star Wars if Disney directed it. Will it be a reboot?
<Polydunami> Wait, I mean PRODUCED it.
<[SWAG]Haku> New tirlogy
<sonicdude558> I will take 99 of those plushie back.
<[SWAG]Haku> Disney is making a SEQUEL TRILOGY
<[SWAG]Haku> not a reboot
*sonicdude558 steals 99 of Saturn's Twi plushies
<Polydunami> Oh wow. So no Darth Vader :S
<Reikim> Hm
<Reikim> So basically
*emangamer could not give any less of a shit about star trek
<Reikim> Not much going on here.
<sonicdude558> and they are all mine. MINE! ALL MINE
<emangamer> i mean star wars
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Nope.
<[SWAG]Haku> emangamer OUT
<Reikim> All right.
<NullRadix> ... so... just to make sure everyone knows... Lucas (at one point) had a sequel trilogy already planned
<superretroworld> i cant believe lucas approved this
<[SWAG]Haku> Yes, Lucas had a sequel trilogy planned, but he abandoned it
<Shizuka> 13i thought everyone knew it was intended to be 9 films
<emangamer> the only thing that can make the star wars series better is if Lucas dies
*Reikim breaks yet another window and hops out
<[SWAG]Haku> because he FELT THE TRILOGY ENDED THE STORY PERFECTLY.
<Polydunami> Well that's 4.05 billion dollars thrown around.
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, really? I never heard about the plan for 9 movies.
<Polydunami> I believe that was sarcasm
<[SWAG]Haku> The Stores and comics and everything else told the aftermath of the original trilogy, and he want to keep it to those
<emangamer> Shizuka: aah, the old, make the middle 3, then the first 3, then wait 10 years to make the last 3 scheme...I forgot about that old trick
<otakon> Shizuka: what movie?
<otakon> Shizuka: oh Star Wars
<[SWAG]Haku> Star Wars otakon
<Polydunami> On another note, it seems GTA V is going to be released in spring.
<Meanwhile> Clearly this was always the plan.
<otakon> dammit I look away for 1 mintue and I lose the converstation
<Meanwhile> Make part 4 5 and 6.
<otakon> Meanwhile: OF COURSE!
<emangamer> otakon: no, george of the jungle
<Meanwhile> Make parts 1 2 and 3 when you have access to better cgi.
<Meanwhile> Sell series to Disney.
<Meanwhile> Let them make the rest of it.
<otakon> emangamer: yeah well you've missed a BUNCH of stuff in regulars that you would find hilarious
<Polydunami> Give it a happy ending, too.
<otakon> inb4 musical numbers
<Polydunami> Also, MAGIC.
<emangamer> otakon: I doubt it
<otakon> I can see it now, EWOKS singing with a princesss
<Polydunami> Pirates didn't have musical numbers.
<kinixys> With Lucas out of the picture maybe Star Wars could be good? I dunno.
<[SWAG]Haku> Star Wars 6 HAD a happy enging, as long as you stay within the movies and not wander into the entended universe
<otakon> and they give them big eyes too
<sonicdude558> ♫ So why do you waste my time!? Is the Answer... ♫
<Mutterguy> Well Disney and Lucaus arts were already pretty close. i
<Momma_Saturn> 08,01people, people
<Momma_Saturn> 08,01how many times do i need to tell you
<otakon> [SWAG]Haku: the extended universe that quickly became crap? with the Yuhvong Zong invasion and the like?
<[SWAG]Haku> yes momma?

<sonicdude558> So Momma_Saturn how about them 99 plushie I gave you :3

<emangamer> oh god....Saturn, why THE HELL are people calling you mamma

<cachi01> k
<superretroworld> oh
*sonicdude558 hugs his imaginary twi plushie and throws it behind him, turning into air
<otakon> goddamn NEXT game isn't out yea they already talk about the next one
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<cachi01> portal is a FPPTS
<emangamer> that's because NO ONE likes treyarch
<emangamer> treyarch sucks
<emangamer> did you PLAY WaW
<cachi01> first person portal thinking simulator
<superretroworld> emangamer: but its not a shooter, so id say first person view
<emangamer> superretroworld: you shoot portals
<emangamer> therefore shooter
<superretroworld> oh yeah
<Polydunami> Yeah, it's a fresh spin on the genre
<cachi01> emangamer: zombies is what makes treyarch so awesome
<Polydunami> -_(\

<kinixys> Can anyone salvage the Star Wars storyline?
<mitamaking> Episode 7, I don't know, could be good, just stop with the Anakin
<otakon> Shizuka: ask LadyCanary for tips to make a costume on a budget
<Polydunami> The sun always rises on Disney.
<mitamaking> Make it about Luke again
<Shizuka> 13there is no budget
<Shizuka> 13unless you can make a costume for negative moneys
<Meanwhile> The budget is: dust.
<[SWAG]Haku> The storyline isn't that bad, the prequels just ruined it for everyone
<superretroworld> BaconMane: like i said, its an april fools day 'winks eye'
<ASoftFluffyThing> Nope.
<Ponies47> My dad's reaction to hearing about episode 7 PRICELESS! XD

<Shizuka> 13they lock the main movies in their "vault" for a decade at a time
<Master_of_War> TAKE IT BACK!

<Master_of_War> STOP IT!
<Shizuka> 13star wars will never be allowed to pass into the public domain
<superretroworld> Ponies47: what did they say?
<Master_of_War> - http://www.mlponline.net/attachments/rainbowscared-gif.477/

<mitamaking> Lucas has a big share of Disney now though
<superretroworld> Shizuka: but if we complain, then lucasfilms will destroy the contract
<Momma_Saturn> 08,01and also the Despecialised Editions
<Momma_Saturn> 08,01my god, those things
<Momma_Saturn> 08,01so awesome
<Polydunami> See, I do like Star Wars, but I find it to be overrated.
<Brony2447> Rainbow Dash askes, "Have you ever snorted powdered lightning?"
<Master_of_War> Lucas x money
<Phase4> i've got a laserdisk copy of the lion king
<mitamaking> The Despecialised Editions are just as bad as the Special Editions
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> Momma_Saturn: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEBbu-wkKrs
<Polydunami> As in, people make it out to be the greatest thing ever.
<Phase4> its awesome :3
<Ponies47> superretroworld: They just starred at me and I was all like "Deal with it" B)
<superretroworld> Polydunami: same
<Mutterguy> on the other hand DEATH STAR VS GALACTUS! Who's the faster Planet Destroyer special edition motion comic
<Momma_Saturn> 08,01mitamaking: how?
<mitamaking> They are a fan making changes he sees fit
<superretroworld> Ponies47: awsome. id love to do that sometime, but to shy
<VenHur> The fastest planet destroyer is the DEATH STAR! ...With a moustache.
<ASoftFluffyThing> How did Saturn become Momma_Saturn?
<ASoftFluffyThing> VenHur, with a top hat and monocle
<Ponies47> superretroworld: Don't be shy :3
<cachi01> Mutterguy: at the end mickey mouse will appear and will start singging its a small world after all and galactus and the empire will hug
<Phase4> ASoftFluffyThing, when a mommie and a daddy love each other very much...
<mitamaking> ASoftFluffyThing: you see when 2 planets like each other and wanna have a baby planet....
<VenHur> ...Call it Death EGG instead of Death STAR and there you go.
<Momma_Saturn> 08,01mitamaking: but they're as close to the theatrical releases as you can get; they are better than any other edition in my opinion
<Mutterguy> cachi01 that has yet to happen with marvel
<Shizuka> 13BUT WAIT
<Shizuka> 13THERE'S MORE
<Phase4> D:

<Ryunosuke> kinixys, again, you forgot again
<mitamaking> I could get behind a new Ewoks cartoon, I like the old one
<Phase4> no offence to fans but i think theres enough star wars by now
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Over reacting much?

<mitamaking> Shizuka: Again, The Avengers exist right?
*Ponies47 Laughs like a nutjob

<SirGanjalf> ^NOOOOOOOOOO
<Phase4> 6 movies, endless books, many games, 2 high profile mmos, the expanded univers, several television shows

<Polydunami> All officially produced, Phase4?
<DeadpoolDash> Disney can't ruin Star Wars any worse then George Lucas did.
<superretroworld> Ponies47: sorry bout that :(
<Momma_Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: i counter with http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5TXyJlEMc
*superretroworld hugs Ponies47
<SirGanjalf> DeadpoolDash: i agree, tbh
<superretroworld> DeadpoolDash: BURNNNNNNN
<mitamaking> This also means Disney has full rights to Howard the Duck
<Master_of_War> http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
<Mutterguy> A new myst movie sounds like a money spinner for Wellington
<Ryunosuke> DeadpoolDash, yes they can
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My right arm feels funny....
<cachi01> Momma_Saturn: dat alestorm
<Ryunosuke> they can put in a random musical number in it :)
<AJIsAwesome> Momma_Saturn: MUCH better. :D
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[School]: thats for clopping all day
<Ponies47> superretroworld: It's fine. I don't care if people judge me over the fact I like ponies. They can deal with it -hugs back- Atleast I got you guys :3
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[School]: so stop clopping
<SirGanjalf> DeadpoolDash: Besides Marvel fans were worried too, and then: Avengers
<Ryunosuke> they can put in someone WORSE than Jar jar binks
<superretroworld> does anybody think they'll have songs in the star wars sequel?
<Colt_Brovakiin> Master-Derps: :D we where spamming that in class the other day! :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hey Avengers was good
<Mutterguy> because apparently We have good scenery
<cachi01> superretroworld: disney
<Ryunosuke> They can have Sinbad star in it :)
<mitamaking> I just love how people forget that Disney produced movies that are serios
<mitamaking> *serious
<Master-Derps> er Colt_Brovakiin in not even talking :)
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Lots of ewoks you say? Wonder if we'd see more stuff like this *shudder*: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLt0GaIBMIs
<mitamaking> It is insulting
<DeadpoolDash> Lucas already did all the bad ideas and Disney for the most part learns from mistakes since they like to make money
<Polydunami> I mentioned Pirates of the Caribbean before. Nopony noticed.
<Colt_Brovakiin> Master-Derps: Sorry I tab faild :P my bad
<mitamaking> J_E_Smith71: I like that show
<Master-Derps> no prob
<Mutterguy> what about Tangled?
<J_E_Smith71> Though I prefered the first theme myself: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8bqcoqfYds
<Shizuka> 13Polydunami: shh let us wax emo over the doomed fate of star wars :2
<Master-Derps> ill just go back to hiding in the list of names

<Polydunami> Well yeah, but it's kind of there.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh good god you people...
<mitamaking> Star Wars will be fine Shizuka have some faith that Disney likes money
<Mutterguy> but the Horse was awesome
<Ponies47> superretroworld: I've been trying to make friends. It's not working :<
<DeadpoolDash> Besides, Disney and Star Wars brought us this http://youtu.be/UdbajvVROjc
<Master_of_War> At lest ROtS was decent...
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Wallpaper Compilation #70
<J_E_Smith71> Maybe Disney will have crazy Star Wars dance numbers in the movies. They already do at Disney World during Star Wars Weekends: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsrbQK9kgQg
<cachi01> DeadpoolDash: is he gangnam styling???

<RaveBrony> Oh geez
<twilight_sprinkle> in my school we didnt have any choice, everyone followed the same curriculum
<Petrified_Discord> Science: what is?
<Kurra> The number one thing i hate about school was that teachers never EVER EVER cared about the injustices that other kids pulled not just behind their backs, but under their noses. :[
<flutter_spin> like that would work?
<twilight_sprinkle> and it was boring stuff like literature, language, etc
<HoodyVorheez> twilight_sprinkle: Hate it fo ya, I gets ta work on carz
<Petrified_Discord> Um...
<Petrified_Discord> What was that plan?
*Kurra gets angry at what this show painfully truthfully illustrates
<flutter_spin> lol

<flutterchu> oh wait.....
<GreenPony> Odd questions?
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Student: "Running...out of oxygen..."

<Mutterguy> I've beeen to Bratislavia!

<Kurra> Hello, my name is Kurra. :3
<HoodyVorheez> Launguage teachers scare me
<flutterchu> THE GHOST OF NIGHTMARE MOON WILL MEET ME :)
<Kurra> My college/uni profs were BAWSSS AMMAGOSH! :D
<flutter_spin> pun.
<Petrified_Discord> Bigeff
<twilight_sprinkle> i remember my language teachers' butthurt that our class was focused on math instead of language
<StinkomanFan> F
<Kurra> WRONG
<VenHur> Lolwut
<Mutterguy> I can't complain about my teachers. One of my science teachers let me out for overdue homework because of the 11th of september attacks. Too distracting.

<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02I noticed how the math and physics teachers were the nicest of all
<GreenPony> gonna go eat Pizza
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02English teachers were the WORST
<J_E_Smith71> My Japanese teacher was really sweet...though it was too much I had to drop the course but she let me still set in on it anyways because the people and the TAs were so fun
<Lunar_Brony> My last student teacher promised us Timbits, but ONLY if we behaved.
<GreenPony> Be right back all
<HoodyVorheez> My english teacher is nice
*Kurra bets that with a certain mathematical equation, we can prolly calculate the odds of any one of us having gone to at least 1 same school as another one of us :3
<RaveBrony> I love math :3
<Petrified_Discord> Just play "be a man" and turn him into a badass
<Shizuka> 13NewSpookyBronyU: they usually are, says a lot about why english skills are crashing
<flutter_spin> English teachers were rough with me, but they liked me after what I did during the school walk-out
<thelonepony> Night everyone and thanks for the strema NewSpookyBronyU :3
<twilight_sprinkle> my math teacher was the best teacher i ever had. he got so angry when someone cant solve something simple(for him), he would yell so loud you could hear him throughout the school. but he genuinely wanted us to do good, and he kne math very well
<Mutterguy> Oh and we got to watch American Pie at the end of the year one time. Students choice...
<RaveBrony> Audible Gasp!
<sub06905> i liek my english teacher :$
<AJIsAwesome> My high school teacher was strict, but she could be VERY nice. She's been my favorite teacher, next to my math teacher.
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Every English teacher acted like they were out of touch with reality and graded every assignment like their opinions were 1:1 with the author of each book.
<twilight_sprinkle> also my math teacher liked to troll us during tests and kept saying things to distract us
<flutter_spin> I've lost weight! 30 pounds.

<NullRadix> flutter_spin: gratz!
<J_E_Smith71> One of my history teachers (the laid back one) once spent the class telling a goofy story about himself.
<twilight_sprinkle> NewSpookyBronyU: where if the teacher has a different view on something, youre screwed
<RaveBrony> Lol!!
<Lunar_Brony> NewSpookyBronyU sucks to be you! My english teachers were AWESOME!!

<Kurra> also, flukshooating
<HoodyVorheez> Cats

<HoodyVorheez> Hiro did his homework!
<VenHur> Ah...the good 'ol Nickelodeon lightbulb...most common Nick logo too.
<Petrified_Discord> What's odd is that I wasn't a huge fan of this show while I was in grade school, but now I find it pretty amusing :)
<flutter_spin> My Biology teacher taught us nothing. She dropped the final test on us and whispered "Put the grade you think you made on the topright of the sheet of paper"
<otakon1> Lunar_Brony: get this, I have a job and the money to afford an actual connection to the internet now without aping it off the neighbors(whose signal is weak and fluctuates) however my mom says "Why bother when we get it for free?" She doesn't want me to get us proper internet and it'a aggravating as hell.
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02J_E_Smith71: I'll play some after a chapter of Uncharted 3 o3o
<VenHur> Ah, not another update...
<HoodyVorheez> Everyone copied off of me in civics ._.

<twilight_sprinkle> and ponies
<twilight_sprinkle> dont forget the ponies
<flutter_spin> yeesh. I'm still trying to avoid fixing my mom's computer. She finally got on it after 2 years and it worked for 2 hours.
<otakon1> she doesn't watch it like we do
<kinixys> otakon1: Reliability?
<HoodyVorheez> Ew ponies? Gay.
<Shizuka> 13it will keep you out of trouble
<Petrified_Discord> otakon1: Whatever she likes, tell her about something cool relating to it that the internet has
<VenHur> I liek cats.
<otakon1> kinixys: yeah she doesn't care if it randomly goes down either.
<Mutterguy> So thisn't the porygon episode?
<J_E_Smith71> But anyways they went over to some guy passing by and said "Hey could you take this into that club?" and gave him the prostectic leg. They went to a parking lot across from the club and watched the guy go in...and quickly ran out as a bunch of cops chased him
<GreenPony> And fellow Bronies I am back
<otakon1> Petrified_Discord: she likes work
<Petrified_Discord> otakon1: Google docs.
<kinixys> otakon1: Security?
<Phase4> Mutterguy, porygon episode was japanese only
<otakon1> hmmm maybe
<Petrified_Discord> otakon1: Or google drive
<otakon1> kinixys: that too
<GreenPony> What I miss?
<Phase4> Mutterguy, also this isnt pokemon
<flutter_spin> GreenPony: just starting Uncharted 3
<kinixys> otakon1: REally? Huh..
<VenHur> I wished Naghty Dog gets the Crash Bandicoot franchise back from Activision...
<GreenPony> flutter_spin: This game is awesome!
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02"If you're not supposed to abuse cough syrup why does it come with a little plastic shot glass?" -Bill Murray
<Mutterguy> I asked that only because of the epilepsy warning
<VenHur> ...One of these damn days, it WILL happens.
<Phase4> Mutterguy, funnily enough, an english dub of the infamus seisure episode was produced and actually aired in australia
<Phase4> i saw it many years ago
<GreenPony> VenHur: I grew up with Crash! And Spyro, and Gex
<otakon1> okay what the FUCK now my signal has dropped to under .20mbps and a 300ms ping
<otakon1> the FUCK
<Phase4> not sure if any copys still exist
<flutter_spin> GreenPony: Yeah. It's the game where anyone can mistake it as a very long movie
<Lunar_Brony> NewSpookyBronyU because cough syrup is fucking disgusting
<Phase4> otakon1, mobile
<Phase4> ?
<Mutterguy> I heard it was pikachu's fault
<kinixys> otakon1: Someone probably walked in front of the router.
<otakon1> Phase4: no this is wifi, my neighbors. my mom doesn't want to get actual internet
<VenHur> I mean, sure, Uncharted is great...but who wanted to see a GOOD Crash game since Twinsanity?
<Phase4> Mutterguy, yes and no, pickachu used thunderbolt on some missles, which caused almost fullscreen red/blue flashing
<GreenPony> flutter_spin: Yeah, looks like a movie, but better
<otakon1> bc we've got access to my neighbors
<J_E_Smith71> Mutterguy: No Pikachu shocked some missles and the explosion caused the bright flashes
<Phase4> otakon1, ah
<otakon1> it fucking sucks
<flutter_spin> I don't know about convincing her for proper Internet.
<flutter_spin> Sorry ota.
<otakon1> I need to convince her that we need proper internet for reiliability and security
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: i saw the flashing bit on youtube, it really was unpleasant for the eyes
<Lunar_Brony> Good luck with that!
<Hiro> The first game my family got was for my sister, it was my little pony
<Phase4> Mutterguy, there was actually a fair ammount of research done, photosensetivie seizures are aparently triggered real easy by red/blue oscilations
<flutter_spin> PUSH
<otakon1> I mean god's sake it's only 50 bucks a month
<otakon1> I can afford that
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl
<VenHur> Hiro: You was one lucky hell of a bastard.
<GreenPony> Someone should play LittleBigPlanet2
<kinixys> 50? I get it for less.
<flutter_spin> My mom can't afford that, but somehow she still can't pay the bills. Must be because she takes a vacation every 4 months.
<Phase4> dat phobia
<Phase4> this movie has poor cgi
<VenHur> Hush, this movie is great!
*Lunar_Brony sigh
<flutter_spin> All we need is... well nevermind
<RaveBrony> o.o

<Cades[Phone]> hey
<VenHur> Press X to JASON!
<flutter_spin> Quick! Add snakes!
<Shizuka> 13this is Fahrenheit right?
<twilight_sprinkle> no this is patrick
<Phase4> "charlie, we can get through this" *punch*
<GreenPony> You mean Indigo Prophecy
<Shizuka> 13the game made of 100% quick time events
<flutter_spin> twilight_sprinkle: awesome.
<Phase4> Shizuka, nah, its drakes quicktime adventure
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: yeah i know his pain, once you install quicktime it's hard to get rid of
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka that's all the Uncharted series has ever been, and always will be
<flutter_spin> Johnny boy.
<Shizuka> 13wiat where did these two come from
<Phase4> XD
<flutter_spin> SHOOT HIM
<twilight_sprinkle> theres actually quite a bit of non quick time events parts of this game
<Shizuka> 13why didn't they help earlier?
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka game logic
<Shizuka> 13WHAT YEAR IS IT
<flutter_spin> Is that his twin brother's skull behind him?
<HoodyVorheez> Shizuka: 1945
<otakon1> Shizuka: lol they just caught up and it's 2012
<Lunar_Brony> seems legit
<Shizuka> 13also we should watch jumanji
<Shizuka> 13get on that will you ponies?
<HoodyVorheez> No, no...
<flutter_spin> Didn't we already stream Jumanji?
<HoodyVorheez> We need more lemon pledge
<flutter_spin> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> like a rabbit dog
<flutter_spin> wabbit
<Lunar_Brony> I remember watching Jumanji when I was 3. Scared the living shit outta me.
<Shizuka> 13tell me about the rabbits george
<HoodyVorheez> Wabbit season
<otakon> well crap
<flutter_spin> drop the torch :)
<otakon> my usb adapter keeps crapping out
<Phase4> clear violation of the building code
<Lunar_Brony> and a few years later I saw the less-than-adequate remake Zathura
<twilight_sprinkle> and then draugr
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Phase4: no OSHA Compliance
<Phase4> how does turn wheel
<Lunar_Brony> or something along those lines
<Shizuka> 13THRILL as the player character struggles with simple machines!
<flutter_spin> spin the globe?
<Lunar_Brony> yeah, Zathura. Jumanji in space
<Phase4> dat fire XD
<VenHur> Uncharted 3: The Ultimate Challenge? VALVE PUZZLES!
<HoodyVorheez> Shizuka: So, almost every adventure/puzzle game?
<Phase4> running animation needs work
<Kimori> hi Cades
<flutter_spin> MY BACK IS ON FIRE
<HoodyVorheez> Woody run
<Shizuka> 13i think they have a cream for that now
<flutter_spin> great. Now I have "apply directly to the forehead" commercial in my mind
<Cades[Phone]> it's been way to quiet today
<Phase4> its a good thing this ancient civilization not only knew the earth was round but had an accurate enough map to construct a globe
<Shizuka> 13and the tools to do it
<twilight_sprinkle> i bet they were aliens
<twilight_sprinkle> made of glass
<HoodyVorheez> Well, they were smarter then everyone else?
<Kimori> yeah...
<GreenPony> flutter_spin: man, I hate that commercial SO much
<Kimori> Ive been busy as usual irl :/
<flutter_spin> lol
<Cades[Phone]> yeah same
<Phase4> Shizuka, actually yeah, where did they get the tools
<VenHur> So...Uncharted = Mordern Day Indiana Jones/Laren Croft
<GreenPony> Also, anyone familiar with the E.T game for Atari 2600?
<Phase4> plus those gears
<Kimori> By the looks of it too, my leave of absence might be sooner than i think
<flutter_spin> he runs funny
<Phase4> need a lathe to make gears right
<Cades[Phone]> oh :(
<Phase4> hardly complicated but still needs a bit of knowledge
<flutter_spin> woho!
<Phase4> spoiders?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<HoodyVorheez> Spiderses
<Phase4> spoiders.
<HoodyVorheez> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Sup sucka?
<otakon> damn that's a LOT of bugs
<VenHur> GreenPony: Oh, that game. It's the greastes game I'd ever seen! >_>
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> HoodyVorheez: not much :D

<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<otakon> one more
<otakon> MAKE IT COUNT!
<GreenPony> VenHur: Ok, sorry xD
<flutter_spin> What if they were all one monster that is made up by spiders?

<Phase4> end;
<Shizuka> 13instant reloading
<Shizuka> 13i didn't know we finally had this technology
<VenHur> Jason during his younger years
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02o3o
<Phase4> Shizuka, blasphemy
<twilight_sprinkle> 3o3
<Phase4> must have been a bug
<GreenPony> VenHur: Well you can worry no longer, as I have found a copy of the game, played it for 1 minute, drowned it in lighter Fluid, and set it on fire in my furnace
<HoodyVorheez> we've had it since Jak and Daxter
<Shizuka> 13shouldn't you have had to reload the entire game to go back two minutes?
<Canadian_Brony> I just got disconnected from the chat, I couldn't get back in for a minute or so, and my other nick is "in use." This is the second time this happened to me in 3 days. WTF is going on?
<GreenPony> there was not a hint of its existance left O_O
<flutter_spin> you touched the spiders and live!
<Mutterguy> guys! check xkcd now!
<Shizuka> 13Canadian_Brony: standard issue pingout, just ghost your nick
<HoodyVorheez> Majick torches
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> VenHur: lol close,its Rick Taylor from the Splatterhouse series
<Shizuka> 13wishbone! :d
<Shizuka> 13i love xkcd~
*flutter_spin 's heart jumps a beat
<Phase4> Canadian_Brony, its 250 seconds btw
<GreenPony> Splatterhouse was awesome
<GreenPony> the old ones I mean <_<
<Phase4> spoiders
<Phase4> they're after you
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 thank. Any particular reason why I couldn't get back in for 250 seconds?
<HoodyVorheez> Phase4: Its a conspiracy man!
<Canadian_Brony> *thanks
<VenHur> So SpookyBrony, ever thinking of playing all the Jak games (expect Daxter on the PSP) chronologically?
<GreenPony> Aright, I have to go. gotta sleep for work
<Canadian_Brony> g'night GreenPony
<twilight_sprinkle> bye GreenPony
<HoodyVorheez> latas Pony who is Grean
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> GreenPony: i liked the 2010 ver,some bugs but i think its fun :)
<flutter_spin> The spiders want your... I can't say it.
<Phase4> Canadian_Brony, yeah, your nick was in use, notmally people just use a different nick, like adding _ to the end
<HoodyVorheez> green*
<VenHur> And be prepared for a WTF plot twist in Jak 3...
<Shizuka> 13Canadian_Brony: IRC server sends a PING message to your client every few seconds, client sends back a PONG
<GreenPony> Bye-Bye
<GreenPony> Daxter was pretty fun on the PSP
<twilight_sprinkle> o btw Phase4 , i was thinking you might want to add time zone to !cd
<Phase4> why are the walkways disentergrated but the fires still full of wood
<HoodyVorheez> HOW THE HELL DID YOU GET UP HERE?
<GreenPony> First game I got for it
<Shizuka> 13if the server doesn't receive a PONG for 250 seconds (depending on the network), it assumes you're dead and releases your connection
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, GreenPony :)
<GreenPony> Night everypony
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: more importantly why do they have infinite torches
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 -_(\ not the ghosting problem. I was disconnected as Lunar_Brony and failed to reconnect even as Canadian_Brony.
<flutter_spin> Oh THAT one spins
<Phase4> Canadian_Brony, really strange
<flutter_spin> Must not think of Amnesia. Must not.
*Kurra nestles
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: i mean not time-zone dependance, but just say its GMT
<Phase4> twilight_sprinkle, not my code :P
<Phase4> !cd
<Tom> Episode 1 of season 3 "The Crystal Empire, Part 1" airs in 10 days, 10 hours, 17 minutes, 9 seconds (Nov 10 15:00:00 2012)
<HoodyVorheez> DON'T
<twilight_sprinkle> o
<twilight_sprinkle> ok
<Canadian_Brony> I even tried the /connect command, but I just got a message saying I wasn't registered.
<Phase4> twilight_sprinkle, but i'll bug the person who makes it
<HoodyVorheez> HURRICANE SANDY BROUGHT SHARKS
<Phase4> Canadian_Brony, strange
<twilight_sprinkle> Phase4: okay thanks :)
<Kurra> Wow dynamic lighting!
<flutter_spin> I hope it works. Be one short game.
<twilight_sprinkle> those rocks must have some enormous friction
<Kurra> I remember when I had to choose between framerate or dynamic lighting.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kurra: i dont have to choose, its 800x600 minimum or no go
<Phase4> the spinny sphere rock thing works irl, but the rocks have to be polished
<Phase4> that rock is clearly not polished
<Canadian_Brony> IKR? Has this ever happened before? I didn't lost stream connection, and I'm sitting beside my modem, so it can't be my internet.
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah ive heard of the polished thing, but they are Not polished
<Phase4> also drake must be super buff to move it like that
<Canadian_Brony> or it somehow happens to be extremely light
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder if they have an ancient video game somewhere in that dungeon
<flutter_spin> just match the dots with the holes
<Canadian_Brony> but it's a video game
<Canadian_Brony> so it doesn't matter
<flutter_spin> But spinning that bad boy is hard.
<p4ngya> Phase4: ist being pushed up by water
<Phase4> p4ngya, it could be frictionless for all i care, still about a tonn of rock to rotate
*HoodyVorheez pokes chat
<flutterchu> what game is this?
<Canadian_Brony> Hey! That tickles.
<flutter_spin> Uncharted 3
<HoodyVorheez> Maybe its hollow?
<twilight_sprinkle> and maybe its some really dense water-like substance, idk
<Phase4> what is that noise
<Canadian_Brony> what's up with the sound all of a sudden
<Phase4> then the net was split
<twilight_sprinkle> ancient electricity
<flutter_spin> totally phase. Lasers. Sound of lasers :P
<twilight_sprinkle> runs on magic
<Phase4> this is what magnets sound like
<HoodyVorheez> Friendship rock
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> NewSuperBronyU: try and line up the light on the left with Australia
<RoboGerbil_> anyone want to fill the last slot in a l4d2 game?
<flutter_spin> He's got it
<Canadian_Brony> NewSuperBronyU your sound has gone haywire. Please fix it.
<Phase4> theres the middle east
<Phase4> and there it is
<flutter_spin> Someone sounded the alarm!
<Kurra> It sounds like a... like a... It sounds like a CNC water drill!
<Phase4> no, srsly, who gave them the tools to manufacture this
<flutter_spin> Quick! Get out before the dogspiders get you
<Phase4> that stone pillar isnt floating there of its own accord
<Phase4> what is that noise
<kinixys> What movie is this?
<Kurra> NewSuperBronyU: you activated an ancient CNC water cutter?
<HoodyVorheez> Da Vincci?
<Phase4> its quite anoying

<Canadian_Brony> NewSuperBronyU don't do that! If you do, wear headphones!
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> oh then that was the sound of the universe tearing NewSuperBronyU
<Canadian_Brony> Silly filly..
<flutter_spin> lol universe tearing. I like that.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm watching the game on my TV while my computer is capturing the gameplay. I muted the audio on my computer to listen on the TV.
<Canadian_Brony> sounds 'bout right
*HoodyVorheez puts a bandaid on the universe
<HoodyVorheez> All better :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm sorry for doing it ;^;
<flutter_spin> You watching the game on your .. oh ... football or something?
<Canadian_Brony> s'alright
<Kurra> NewSuperBronyU makes best noises
*HoodyVorheez espn theme
<Petrified_Discord> flutter_spin: How does one watch gameplay on a football? :O
<VenHur> I seen the news report on the TV and god damn, New Jersey looked like a wasteland.
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> VenHur: really?
<HoodyVorheez> VenHur: And then the Fire nation attacked
<flutter_spin> She detects a draft. lol.
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin no, he's using a capture card to play the game on his TV and transfer it to his computer where it is then sent to us as stream
<Kurra> VenHur indeed, looks like 2012 or a horror movie or Gettysburg or....
<Petrified_Discord> HoodyVorheez: And then the Water Tribe retaliated
<Canadian_Brony> I need to figure out how to do that . . . TO GOOGLE!
<kinixys> This is precisly how I search for my keys in rl.
<flutter_spin> Oh yeah. PS3. I forgot. Midnight and all. Tired.

<otakon> he sacrified himself
<J_E_Smith71> Okay guys, avoid pictures of Season 3 toys and the toys themselves...because one of the toys has a big spoiler that may blow people away. It'll be a nice suprise when it happens for those who keep away from it
<twilight_sprinkle> i didnt know that was possible in this game
<Canadian_Brony> Show's over, go home now.

<Lunar_Brony> I shoveled a driveway that contains a large, uneven crack at every metre AND it sits on a hill!

<flutterchu> oh and hello ASoftFluffyThing
<Shizuka> 13all the guys i know call me crazy when i tell them they could wear tights and extend shorts season by a good three weeks
<Shizuka> 13keeps your legs warm :)

<Shizuka> 13and there's a sort of valley between here and school

*ASoftFluffyThing snuggles Jmo44
<ASoftFluffyThing> Damn keyboard is shorting again >>
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: UTC adds leap seconds i believe, it replaces UTC but for everyday use is functionally the same
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> edd it was 8 minutes
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> half of what they posted was the "Failure song"
<Phase4> ah
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> shhhhhhhh
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> they had shown us earlier
<Jmo> <<
<twilight_sprinkle> hm ok
<eddmario> SpeccyRush|Drawing: Technically it was 5, since the intro is about 3
*Jmo nuzzles ASoftFluffyThing

<eddmario> So, who's playing?
<sub06905> ah spoilers
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Assassin's Creed III isn't out yet :<
<magmablock> Evil Celestia? Pish Posh
<otakon> eddmario: it's NewSuperBronyU
<otakon> there is no evilestia
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> it made me jump
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> NewSuperBronyU: uh yes it is
<AdamTheDuck> It isn't?
<ASoftFluffyThing> NewSuperBronyU, yes it is.
<otakon> good lord
<magmablock> Of all the characters to turn evil, she is literally the last that comes to mind
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02not on Wii U :<
<magmablock> Even Fluttershy is more likely to turn to the dark side
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Which is the definitive version :)
<eddmario> I don't know if it's considered spoilers, but is mentioning that a certain character reappers during the first few minutes count as one?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> that's why its so scary
<Shizuka> 13is it out on PC? steam still says november
<twilight_sprinkle> they found all the thu'ums
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> yes so shutup with the talkin

<otakon> SeaponiesofLiverpool: it's starry starry night
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Dr. flutterstein
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Fluttershy can't bear to see dead animals so she reanimates their corpses
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> like Frankenstein
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> ya don't say
<eddmario> I'm getting a very Burn Notice vibe right now. I guess because the guy with the red shirt reminds me of Bruce Campbell
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> totally something Fluttershy would do
<magmablock> The version of Frankenstein I read had him grow the monster in a tube
<Lunar_Brony> Shizuka you pay ~$1 per litre for gas, and up here, we pay $1.32 per litre.
<Lunar_Brony> Why is American gas so damn cheap?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> welp gonna go see if I can find ACIII lets play on youtube
<magmablock> I kinda like that version better
<Shizuka> 13Lunar_Brony: well actually
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> cheap he says

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> eddmario lol now i wanna Bruce as Sully in an Uncharted movie :D with Nate's VA *just like the Michael cm*
<otakon> again
<Shizuka> 13california's up that high i think
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> foreign gas is always cheaper due to different wage standards
<otakon> I hate the goddamn combat in these guns
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02It's about $4.39 here
<sub06905> ^
<Shizuka> 13ouch much higher
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Shizuka: and thats just for regular?
<Shizuka> 13yep
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> we get USA gas and the price goes up because we have to pay minimum wage, etc.
<Shizuka> 13up here the nonregulars have been above $4 since... probably 08
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hey, at least it doesn't cost the same as ink, which is like $2,000 a gallon
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> well im off 2 bed night everypony :)
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> sucks for anyone that needs premium
<Lunar_Brony> only $1.15 per litre in California
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Made in America, but the cost is a bit higher
<Shizuka> 13i think the stations have all been reluctant to break $4 for regular
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Night Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<Lunar_Brony> you have cheap gas
<Lunar_Brony> compared to us, anyways
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> you DIED
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02o3o
<Shizuka> 13so we were peaking about $3.98 in minnesota, but that's starting to come down quick, think it's around $3.24 now
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Sketch_Toku_Brony
<eddmario> the average here is 3.535
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> $4 in July 2008
<eddmario> in dollars
<Polydunami> It is getting rather gassy in here, isn't it? :P
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Winter gas is cheaper
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<eddmario> Polydunami: *facehoof*
<SpeccyRush|Drawing> Shizuka: its amazing that there was a gas shortage in the 70'sand yet it was around a dollar still then
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> SB64 do you have ACIII?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> GRAVITY FALLS MARATHON
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> time for GRAVITY FALLS MARATHON
<Polydunami> So what sparked this conversation? :3
<Lunar_Brony> Now that I think about it, everything in the US is cheaper. Most of our prices are monitered by the governemt, except gas.
<Polydunami> xD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02SeaponiesofLiverpool: No :/
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> y?
<Shizuka> 13SpeccyRush|Drawing: inflation :3

<Shizuka> 13but yeah i saw an article a week or two ago that we should expect gas prices to drop maybe 50 cents by the end of the year, i forget quite why
<Shizuka> 13something about the reserves building up from everyone being broke over the summer i think
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I was talking about Gravity Falls
<Mega_Milk> NewSuperBronyU: Audio out of synch.
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami Shizuka and I were comparing life styles, and that somehow got into gas.

Within four minutes, one kid not only opened the box, found the on-off switch … powered it up. Within five days, they were using 47 apps per child, per day. Within two weeks, they were singing ABC songs in the village, and within five months, they had hacked Android,” Negroponte said.

<DeathStar> NewSpookyBronyU: unless it's cancer...
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02I tried the controller and probably the only thing I didn't like about it was the feeling of my two thumbs farther away on the controller than normal.
<Brony2447> therainbowvortex: i think isaiah asked about it they are silversun pickups (sspu(
<Brony2447> *)
<Moopy> hey dude you guys made some changes here on the chat? cause theres a security report thing on my screen here

<DeathStar> Panda: well... most things would be better if gaming companys could simply take the best ideas and use them even if another company has a similar thing,
<Lunacorn|Joyful> majora's mask HD :O
<Moopy> your still on the Wii U stuff NewSpookyBronyU?
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Moopy: Yesh ;3;
<Moopy> wow
<Panda> DeathStar, yeah... it would be good if all the companies werent in competition...
<Rain> no it wouldnt
<Rain> competition makes them get better
<Mutterguy> i wonder if the controller could play music and read .pdfs? I COULD REPLACE MY iPad!!!
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Did you know that the development team for the Wii U was completely shocked when Iwata announced the NFC feature for the Wii U Gamepad when they only just touched upon the feature a few days before the announcement.
<Buytoast> hey guys, let's make brown and Bloom Rooty Tooty Point N' Shooty 7658: More Guns Edition
<Buytoast> this is the future of video games
<Rain> http://i.imgur.com/3g4iK.jpg
<Lunacorn|Joyful> Buytoast: nahh just get borderlands 2
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02They also had an emergency meeting before Wii U due to streaming issues with the new controller and worked around the clock to fixing it in time.
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02E3*
<Buytoast> but borderlands 2 is just as bad
<Rain> Buytoast, nope. its the future for crappy games
<Buytoast> i don;t want to play LE REDDIT THE GAME
<Panda> Buytoast did you just call that game... bad?
<Rain> some wonderful games are coming, because people are realizing that those games suck
<pony_7480> i feel like 4chan will eventually abuse this mass communication through wii somehow...
<Sumica> 00,10did you know the wii U controler was actaly developed by sega as a new handheld before they went under
<Buytoast> i used to le be a le vault hunter like le you, but then i le took a le arrow to le knee XDDD
<Rain> I'd believe that, Sumica
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Game Gear 2?
<Buytoast> Gotta Sink Fast
<Rain> http://i.imgur.com/3g4iK.jpg
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02I think probably the most interesting fact about the system is that it was suppposed to come out in 2011.
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02But due to development issues with the controller, it had to be delayed.
<Kimori> Its going to be a long night..
<Rain> SB when someone talks crap about wii
<Rain> http://cdn.cinemagr.am/cine_1/20591143.gif
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Although Nintendo didn't say it officially, just knowing that Rayman Origins was originally developed for the Wii U pretty much prooves the fact.
<SirGanjalf> dramaric pug O_O
<Moopy> hey what if happens if i click the security report thing on my screen here at the top right of the screen thats under the minimize and the close window?
<SirGanjalf> *dramatic
<pony_7480> "if you want to piss somebody off, you no longer have to cuse them out, just draw a dick, and send them the pic"|
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Rain: :D
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02Now my only dillema with the system is whether or not I download games off the eShop or buy the physical discs in store o.o
<Panda> brb
<DeathStar> NewSpookyBronyU: do whatever's cheeper :D
<NewSpookyBronyU> 11,02eShop is tax free and I get bonus credit for buying other eShop titles o.o
