<Jspang1> its a pretty good series
<Ghosties> 04Looks like BronyState is closed for right now

<MahBoi777> is there a way to save it?

<Ghosties> 04Whoops
<Ghosties> 04*No
<MahBoi777> I've seen what happens lol
<Jspang1> im kidding6_9
<Ghosties> 04Spamming mods is just as bad as spamming the chat or any other user
<Jspang1> it was a joke
<cachi01> Ghosties: just a question u have to pay monthly or something to get the webpage open or does the .net domain lasts forever?
<Ghosties> 04We paid for the domain
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> 0_0 me brother was interviewed in news
<Ghosties> 04For a year
<Jspang1> its hard to convey sarcasm through text
<Evil_Spike> Indeed
<Ghosties> 04It's fine, Jspang
<d3rb> [wklmeb]JRP2234: what for ?
<cachi01> Ghosties: sooooo that means there ould be a day when bronystate dies :S
<Ghosties> 04Of course
<cachi01> forever......
<Ghosties> 04BronyState's gonna die *eventually*
<Ghosties> 04Key word
<Ghosties> 04*Eventually*
<Evil_Spike> That will be a sad day in brony history
<Ghosties> 04At some point in time
<d3rb> everything has to die eventually
<SirGanjalf> Can i post a YT link now, while no one is streaming?
<cachi01> SirGanjalf: yep
<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties: Which corresponds to...the day after tommorow. (dundundun!):D
<Ghosties> 04But so long as everything stays gravy I'm hoping that won't happen for a long time
<VioletGreySha> we all hope dat
<d3rb> sooo...a week?

<d3rb> dead stream is starting to smell

<cachi01> Phase4: y u no use cool colour again?
*Ghosties slaps Evil_Spike around a bit with a large trout
<Phase4> cachi01, because i can :P
<cachi01> :D
<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties: That wasn't very nice..:<
<Ghosties> 04I don't care :D
<cachi01> xD
<Evil_Spike> Or when somepony starts streaming again
*[Desktop]JRP2234 slaps Ghosties around a bit with a large trout
<VioletGreySha> fish in da face scout style Ghosties
<[Desktop]JRP2234> i declare war
<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties's call to action: "Whatever the fuck I want, just get out of my way when I actually do it.":D
<Ghosties> 04Pretty much
<MahBoi777> lol
<Ghosties> 04I just like to fuck with people
<TheRainbowDash> I thought that was Dari's job to fuck around with others.
<Polydunami> ... I like to watch? O_o
<Ghosties> 04I don't try to intentionally troll
<Ghosties> 04Not bad, not like Val
<TheRainbowDash> Oh...
*cachi01 slaps everypony with a gummy
<TheRainbowDash> Val, oh my god, he is a good troll now.
<TheRainbowDash> I commend him for that.:)
<Ghosties> 04He's getting better
<cachi01> streamers y u no stream some omegle trolling!
<Polydunami> Oh god
<Ghosties> 04He kinda set that standard for "If you demand ponies, you will get ponies...just not the ones you want"
<Ghosties> 04Because it didn't use to be that way
<Polydunami> Hey cachi01, it's not we, but the other side that's the problem
<Polydunami> As in, you could see something you don't WANT to see... you see?
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> i9ve been dieing for someone to stream a request
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> ive*
<d3rb> im sure the demand for constant ponies would have been getting old though
<Ghosties> 04But because so many people wouldn't stop demanding for ponies and not appreciating what streamers were streaming, that's when measures were taken
<cachi01> Polydunami: true..
<MahBoi777> I'll watch anything that's streaming, no complaints
<cachi01> ^
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> <.<
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> >.>
<cachi01> but i just scream G3 OMG for fun xD
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> o rly
<VioletGreySha> i think if there would be only ponys on teh stream it would get boring
<coyboy> why not just make a schedule if its such a problem
<MahBoi777> lol cachi01
<Midnight_Tempest> if i dont like whats on the stream, i turn the stream off... i dont bitch about it, though sometimes i might joke about it
<Ghosties> 04And, you know, if you don't like what's on the stream at the time just go listen to some music, browse the web, or game for a bit until something else is on
<coyboy> and anounce it on your site
<cachi01> or click the popout button
<Polydunami> Yeah, wasn't it Sumica who said, "This is Bronystate, not Ponystate"?
<d3rb> they have bmn and euro movie night
<cachi01> close that window
<Giger4444> Is this really an issue for some people?
<Polydunami> I dunno
<cachi01> and stay in the chat
<Midnight_Tempest> i use chatzilla... it makes it easier for me to stay in the chat while i dont watch the stream...
<Ghosties> 04Maybe he did, but our mission is located right in the About Us - History tab
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> btw i has new upload http://youtu.be/27mNpP9VSQk
<MahBoi777> I love this site, glad mah friend showed it to me
<Giger4444> Are these people complaining to the cable provider that the program sucks but they refuse to change the channel? :)
<Midnight_Tempest> and my mission, that i choose to accept, is to go to bed and sleep...
<Phase4> hmmm, github does not like me
<Evil_Spike> Ooh, new roundup post

<Ponies47> Bat Credit Card
<Ghosties> 04@Malevolent: Oh u

<VioletGreySha> no its pie
<d3rb> mods are the dealers and bronystate is the best gear going around these days
<Ghosties> 04Though, if you do, I highly suggest that you get your life in order before returning to BronyState ^_^
<TheRainbowDash> Malavolent: o_o...I have been on this site for 126 hours now, straight, (Day 5) When will rescue come to pick me up?!
<Malavolent> What is this life thou speak of?
<Malavolent> TheRainbowDash: Well... you're doomed.
<Ghosties> 04That thing that you use to exist
<cachi01> TheRainbowDash: who would ask for rescue in such a wonderful place like this?
<d3rb> bronystate is a feeling! who needs a social life!
<Malavolent> So life is equeal to internet?
<cachi01> BRONYSTATE IS MY PRECIOUS

<Cypresswolf> Irish_Pony: Round 2 next friday - I got to the equivalent of 9 shots straight whiskey
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Well, just that if you are picked from the lottery in those 4 weeks, your choice will be overlooked, and move on, so basically, to sum it up, pretty much, yes.

<Twi_Fi> TheRainbowDash: Rock farmers have a right to make a living too!
<Sylandest> TheRainbowDash: because it makes them feel like their driveway is better than the rest...*facehoofs* lol
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: :)
<TheRainbowDash> Twi_Fi: I'm not talking about rock farmers.:D
<Ninjazz|Tired> Om: I thought we were talking about computers.

<Om> Ninjazz|Tired: Course yar.
<|Discord|> Bronysith|Pirate: Time to post it on youtube.
<Ninjazz|Tired> Om: :P
<rdash> klaxa: its about time you woke up :P
<Saturn> 08,01so my mother is... not the best at food, sometimes
<Sylandest> Saturn: neither is mine
<Irish_Pony> Sylandest: Did you enjoy GilDash's company ;)
<Saturn> 08,01she grew up in a situation where food was scarce
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: I've been in here and playing games.
<Twi_Fi> Hello Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01in the slums of india
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, hello there Saturn! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<rdash> my question klaxa is above several messages... about iris
<Saturn> 08,01so she holds it in almost religious regard
<Bronysith|Pirate> Irish_Pony: your friend did an excellent job on my oc http://jennidash.deviantart.com/art/Use-the-Force-304227938
<Sylandest> Irish_Pony: well, yesterday, she was nice enough to let me rest when I had exhausted myself from exersise, lol
<Saturn> 08,01what she does is she buys tons of food that's reduced
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: You leave yourself too open, mate.
<Irish_Pony> Bronysith|Pirate: Dooohoo jesus :D
<TheRainbowDash> Bronysith|Pirate: My jaw still drops from seing that drawing.
<Xanbreon> The person you want to talk to about iris is Kabaka anyway afaik
<Om> Sylandest: Are you a nimber now?
*Xanbreon shrugs
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: well, I wanna do that! But i gotta do gardening...lol
<Saturn> 08,01more than we can reasonably consume in the timeframe of its expiry
<Om> number*
<klaxa> oh, yeah no idea you should be able to /whois them to see if they are away, no?
<Bronysith|Pirate> TheRainbowDash: i can just spend hours lookiing at it
<rdash> afaik?
<yifle1> Bronysith|Pirate what exatly is a pony oc
<|Discord|> Bronysith|Pirate: Do you have the link in a normal format? Cause youtube does not except swf ending links
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: :D
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: *blinks* what? *realization* oh...agh! XD
<Xanbreon> as far as i know
<Saturn> 08,01so it either gets frozen, or forgotten about
<rdash> oh ok
<Saturn> 08,01except, it's never truly forgotten
<Sylandest> Om: nimber?
<rdash> never used afaik before... *shrugs*
<klaxa> see, if i do /whois MakerDusk
<Saturn> 08,01it just sits in the fridge
<Bronysith|Pirate> |Discord|: wat?
<Saturn> 08,01y'know, to fester
<Saturn> 08,01but the worst thing
<klaxa> * [MakerDusk] is away (I'm not around right now, for assistance please try out our #help channel)
<Sylandest> Saturn: oh?
<Bronysith|Pirate> Saturn: worst possible thing?
<|Discord|> Bronysith|Pirate: I need the link for that Pirate thing that will work with youtube
<klaxa> that's the second line of the /whois output
<Saturn> 08,01the worst thing is that no matter how gone off something is, she will never throw it out
<TheRainbowDash> Uh-oh..
<Saturn> 08,01she *will* find a way to use it
<rdash> it shows the /away message on like 4 of iris...
<TheRainbowDash> Yeah, that is bad Saturn.
<rdash> it shows:
<Saturn> 08,01disguising it heavily with spices or whatever, to hide the fact that it was gone off
<Ninjazz|Tired> ew.
<rdash> WHOIS: MakerDusk
<rdash> realname
<Saturn> 08,01i'll give you an example
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: its not fair, I only just woke up! Shouldn't I get some sort of like...defense..or something?
<rdash> channels
<rdash> server
<rdash> away
<rdash> oper
<rdash> info
<Bronysith|Pirate> |Discord|: http://derpy.me/KpuKN
<rdash> idle
<rdash> account
<rdash> thats all of it
<Om> Sylandest: Nope, you get none.
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: Either run, hide, or embrace. I've done a little of all three.
<Saturn> 08,01we had some cheese in the fridge. normal, good cheese. it was left to go stale, then mouldy
*CrazyCherry noms on Saturn's ear.
<klaxa> but it says what you need ;)
<rdash> thanks
<Sylandest> Om: but-but-but
<TheRainbowDash> Oh...
<|Discord|> Thanks man
<Saturn> 08,01by the time she got round to using it, and i shit you not here, it was *literally* grey
<Om> Sylandest: I'm in the same boat mang
<klaxa> but yeah i bet there should be a possibility to mark them as away on the userlist
<ImOkayWithThis> is mouldy cheese edible?
<Xanbreon> Find an ipad app or deal with iris limitation :( Most web based clients are lacking in some area or another
<rdash> i didnt know that would show in whois... besides, id have to /whois everyone if i wanted to know if theyre away or not
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: I've ran, and I've hid...but embracing is still somewhat scary...lol
<Saturn> 08,01so she made it into a cheese sauce
<TheRandomkid321> ImOkayWithThis did you buy it mouldy?
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: Aye... That it is...
<Saturn> 08,01because apparently it was now "blue cheese"
<Saturn> 08,01and perfectly fine to ea
<ImOkayWithThis> TheRandomkid321: nope
<Saturn> 08,01*eat
<TheRainbowDash> o_o...:O
<rdash> i know theres some irc clients for ipad, but i didnt want to fork over 5.99 for limechat and others...
<rdash> too expensive i think
<Twi_Fi> Saturn: I am amazed.
<TheRandomkid321> ImOkayWithThis than no.
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: granted, gil's best chance was yesterday when my defenses were down. but now im mostly recovered. *shrugs* her loss, lol
<klaxa> there are free ones i think
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: Too open.
<TheRandomkid321> Could anyone suggest soem good xbox 360 game's?
<Bronysith|Pirate> Saturn: number 5 very important. blue cheese. i hate blue cheese
<valoreins> ohai again bronystate! :D
<RankWinner> Hiho people.
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: doh
<Om> Sylandest: I'll let it know.
<Bronysith|Pirate> valoreins: wasabi
<Twi_Fi> Hello RankWinner
<Sylandest> Om: what-wait!
<Saturn> 08,01also, she thinks that putting something in the freezer makes it incapable of going off
<TheRainbowDash> Hello valoreins! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: And that's why you only trust me. :) Not Om.
<Twi_Fi> Hello valoreins

<TheRainbowDash> valoreins: Yay! Good to hear then!
<Saturn> 08,01yesterday, i was treated to some breaded Camembert that had been in the freezer
<TheRandomkid321> Saturn I guess her IQ is lower than teh ammount of stairs a non elevated hosue has.
<Saturn> 08,01it tasted very bitter
<Ninjazz|Tired> ImOkayWithThis: Stay for a while... You'll enjoy the show.
<Om> typing is hard.

<|Discord|> Saturn: Next time you get expired food send it to me...I like to eat it.
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: Scratch that.
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: hehehe, me too, even if I am the subject for the humor :D
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: oh?
<Ingwaz> Saturn: it freezer burns soooo good
<TheRandomkid321> Irish_Pony by your name I asshumed it would be somethin like that.
<Saturn> 08,01TheRandomkid321: it's not that she's stupid, it's just that she's too stubborn to listen to anyone when they tell her anything, and she has some weird preconceptions
<rdash> ?
<rdash> never seen any in the app store...
<klaxa> http://zeptotools.wordpress.com/2009/01/05/irchon-brings-totally-free-irc-chat-client-software-for-iphone/
<Bronysith|Pirate> Saturn: i dislike those kinds of stubborns
<Saturn> 08,01like that if you leave cheese to go off, it's not really gone off, it's just matured into blue cheese
<klaxa> not sure if that's still in the appstore
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: No wait... Unscratch that... Too tired to remember my own names for the sessions on chat.
<klaxa> also, http://myfirstipad.blogspot.de/2011/06/irc999-review-of-free-irc-client-for.html
<Saturn> 08,01and... okay, those who know me will get a chuckle out of this next bit
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: hehehe *unscratches*
<Saturn> 08,01so there were two bees sat on the window
<TheRainbowDash> Alright everypony, got to use that bathroom now, be right back.:D
<Saturn> 08,01not bumblebees, but honeybees
<|Discord|> oh gawd not this joke
<Ninjazz|Tired> TheRainbowDash: Okay.
<TheRandomkid321> Saturn. My whole family thinks the same thing. Im just like "Really? WHat sense does that make?" And she made me eat it (the only thing in the house) For dinner. I was sick the next day... IT WAS A SATURDAY!
<rdash> you can tell the first one is foreign... read the article he wrote
*Sylandest listens to Saturn
<rdash> horrible english
<yifle1> here is my pony oc http://yifle1.deviantart.com/#/d50p5ok
<Saturn> 08,01and she was convinced, and i mean *utterly* convinced that they were wasps
<Saturn> 08,01and she wouldn't listen to me that they were bees
<Bronysith|Pirate> niced yifle1
<TheRandomkid321> yifle cool.
<ImOkayWithThis> i once had a wasp nest in my roof
<Bronysith|Pirate> SHIP ALL THE jedi and sith with me
<yifle1> yay
<Saturn> 08,01and not only this, she wanted to prove me wrong by trapping them in a jar and taking them to one of my fellow beekeepers
<Saturn> 08,01despite the fact
<Saturn> 08,01THAT I'M A FUCKING BEEKEEPER MYSELF
<ImOkayWithThis> lol
*Saturn 08,01fumes
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: so what did you get up to while I was unconcious?
*Ninjazz|Tired pats Saturn on the back
*|Discord| laughs so hard he cry
<Sylandest> there, there, Saturn. We trust your words on the realm of bees!
<rdash> i might just end up buying one anyway...
<StupidSexyCJ> Saturn's a beekeeper? the more you know
<Twi_Fi> Saturn: You are a beekeeper?
<MadSurge> Saturn: oh mothers :D
<TheRandomkid321> Should I get borderlands? IS it any good?
<rdash> thanks for the help though klaxa
<rdash> and wake up! :D
<klaxa> no problem
<Saturn> 08,01Twi_Fi: yup; that's why i tend to talk about bees a lot
<Sylandest> TheRandomkid321: I've heard its fun
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: Lets see.... Ab... So... Lutely... Nothing.
<yifle1> tomorrow is my girlfriends birthday
<PinkiePieFTW> where were y'all last night!
<Saturn> 08,01inb4 not the bees
<PinkiePieFTW> the b-movie was hilarious.
<yifle1> girlfriend
<Om> Ninjazz|Tired: You sure?
<StupidSexyCJ> TheRandomkid321: its alright
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: it's good, if not a bit repetitive
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: I like that idea! If only I could apply it to today...XD
<TheRandomkid321> Seriously my throught feels like its being scratched.
<Twi_Fi> Saturn: What don't you do? :D
<Ninjazz|Tired> Om: You sound like you know something that I should remember. :S
<Saturn> 08,01but yes, that's the kind of stubborn i'm talking about
<TheRandomkid321> MadSurge REPATIVE!? UNNACEPTABLE!
<PinkiePieFTW> oh saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01Twi_Fi: i can't draw.
<PinkiePieFTW> you streaming?
<Saturn> 08,01never been able to
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not, no
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: Well... It can get boring sometimes.
<PinkiePieFTW> oh... who is?
<Saturn> 08,01i can start, if the stream's free
<Om> Ninjazz|Tired: Oh? Ah, no no. Your good.
<Saturn> 08,01no idea
<Twi_Fi> Saturn: I can't draw either.....
<TheRandomkid321> Im also looking at 3DS games
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: well, thats why you come on here to hang with us and so we can give you something to do! :)
<StupidSexyCJ> its a little repetitive, but then, what shooter isnt?
<Ninjazz|Tired> Om: Well, dude. I litterally can't remember or haven't done a single thing after the movies.
<yifle1> i can only draw stickmen :D
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: repetitive as in "you shoot a lot of stuff and you have fun" :D
<Bronysith|Pirate> valoreins:
<Om> Ninjazz|Tired: I was sleepin.
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: Aye. Quite so infact.
<Sylandest> yifle1: stickmen for the win!
<Twi_Fi> I often try to draw, just to practice and get better, but I always end up disgusted with how terrible I am and quit.
<rdash> well, off i go... just bought and installed limechat for ios
<yifle1> :D
<rdash> brb
<Saturn> 08,01Twi_Fi: i have a massive respect for people who can do things i'm shit at. this is why i find people who are good at art very sexy
<Ninjazz|Tired> Om: You didn' tell me. :|
<valoreins> :s
<Om> Ninjazz|Tired: You didn't ask.
<PinkiePieFTW> i love to draw
<TheRandomkid321> MadSurge hmph. Okay. The art style looks good so I may try it.
<PinkiePieFTW> i make comics
<Ninjazz|Tired> Om: I have to ask you?...
<Saturn> 08,01Twi_Fi: i tried practicing, but i can't even draw stick figures
<Sylandest> Ninjazz|Tired: I know when my day is over, I love coming on here, even if for just a short while, hehe. It's almost necessary now, without it, the day doesn't feel quite right
<PinkiePieFTW> but the extent of my talent is stick ppl
<PinkiePieFTW> and shapeless blobs
<StupidSexyCJ> TheRandomkid321: the INSANE amount of weapons and upgrades outshine its repetitive aspects though
<Saturn> 08,01i'll just stick with music
<Om> Ninjazz|Tired: What are we talking about ._.
<PinkiePieFTW> but i'm ok with it
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: Same. Same. It's almost habit now.
<PinkiePieFTW> my brother and I both make comics and read eachothers.
<|Discord|> Saturn: So you think wrek is cool
<Twi_Fi> I fall into despair whenever I see Wrek doing art.
<yifle1> my sister keeps naggin me :D
<Saturn> 08,01|Discord|: i... um, yes
<StupidSexyCJ> PinkiePieFTW: thats cool
<Sylandest> Twi_Fi: why despair? :O
<Ninjazz|Tired> Om: That I must ask you to tell me when you are going to bed so I can say good night to you... o_o
<|Discord|> lolz tat awnser
<Twi_Fi> Sylandest: Because I can't draw and I see how bad I am compared to Wrek.
<MadSurge> TheRandomkid321: I'm getting Borderlands 2 when it comes out. Also, try to see if you can get the "game of the year" edition, it's got all DLC expansion! :)
<Om> Ninjazz|Tired: Is that what we were talking about? Oh, sure.
<Ninjazz|Tired> |Discord|: He actually thinks he's sexy.
<|Discord|> Ninjazz|Tired: OH GOD
<TheRandomkid321> madSurge Ok.
<Twi_Fi> I want to draw my oc but I can't.
<Saturn> 08,01Ninjazz|Tired: indeed
<StupidSexyCJ> Twi_Fi: dooo eeeeeeeet
<Ninjazz|Tired> Saturn: ;)
<Sylandest> Twi_Fi: then don't try to compare yourself if it makes you feel bad. Just relax and enjoy the art you get to see rather than let it make you feel bad. I can't draw either, but I enjoy seeing him draw anyway
<coyboy> MadSurge : Is that borderlands 1 your refering to ?
<MadSurge> coyboy: yep
<Twi_Fi> Sylandest: Oh I enjoy his art still. He's very good after all.
<TheRandomkid321> Borderlands GOTY on sale at EB games for 25. Nice.
<rdash> klaxa: i really like limechat
<rdash> best 4.99 i ever spent
<StupidSexyCJ> Borderlands 2 is gonna be amazing
<Sylandest> Twi_Fi: then you've nothing to worry for or feel bad about, hehe :)
<PinkiePieFTW> If they're gonna show the drawin' thing again, I wanna see pinkie pie.
<Ninjazz|Tired> Om: So anyways, tell me when you heading out, man. I gotta say Cya's and what nots.
<yifle1> Twi_Fi then use this http://generalzoi.deviantart.com/art/Pony-Creator-Full-Version-254295904
<klaxa> okay, psst, not the right channel to talk about that ;)
<Ninjazz|Tired> EVen thought you just got here.
<MadSurge> StupidSexyCJ: I agree :$
<TheRandomkid321> What about Banjo Kazooie. Nuts and bolts?
<rdash> kthxbye:)
<PinkiePieFTW> cya ninjazz
<PinkiePieFTW> oh wait...
<Twi_Fi> yifle1: I do use that, I have three different ocs right now.
*Ninjazz|Tired hugs PinkiePieFTW
<PinkiePieFTW> didn't read the whole comment ^__^;
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, back.
<Om> Ninjazz|Tired: Arhkay, not really my thing to announce when I come and leave all the time. But I suppose I can.

*CrazyCherry yawns
<Sylandest> sleepy, CrazyCherry?
<PinkiePieFTW> or bored/
<coyboy> Madsurge : Yeah it's a really good game only thing I would recomend is to find freinds you know to play with online otherwise you will be stuck with players who are higher levels then you are
<Om> Sylandest: No, its hungry. Hence the yawn
<CrazyCherry> Sylandest: Yes...
<StupidSexyCJ> CrazyCherry's text yawn made me yawn for realz
*ImOkayWithThis hugs CrazyCherry
<PinkiePieFTW> aha. it all makes sense now.
<StupidSexyCJ> Sorcery
<Ninjazz|Tired> Om: You don't gotta announce everything single thing you do *looks at TheRainbowDash* but saying Gnight is a good way of letting us know when to see you off.
<Twi_Fi> yifle1: But you can do so much more if one is able to draw.
<Sylandest> Om: but CrazyCherry says she is sleepy?
<Sylandest> CrazyCherry: *offers blanket*
<Twi_Fi> yifle1: But at least it's something.
<Om> Sylandest: My mistake.
*CrazyCherry hugs ImOkayWithThis back.
<StupidSexyCJ> Twi_Fi: practice makes perfect my friend
<yifle1> Twi_Fi pardon?
*CrazyCherry takes Sylandest's blanket.
<Twi_Fi> yifle1: Sorry, about the pony creator compared to actually drawing an OC.
<yifle1> its okay
<PinkiePieFTW> i wish i could put was in my brain on paper...
<Om> Ninjazz|Tired: Mmmkay. Feel too much like ego strokeing to be all I AM HErE, Look at my hereness!

<Om> Ninjazz|Tired: mmkay
<CrazyCherry> ImOkayWithThis: I'm not going to sleep...

<Twi_Fi> Sylandest: My question went unanswered...
<Saturn> 08,01so a friend of mine just asked me for advice on the making of moth-themed knitwear. here's the response i gave him:
<Ninjazz|Tired> Sylandest: She needed to be reminded that she is in public pony areas.

*Phase4 00,02hugs sammiver
<CrazyCherry> Hiya Im_a_Scatmare!!!
<Twi_Fi> I was going to ask this question to Wrek, but I guess I can ask everypony, when learning to draw do you need to learn any special steps or is it just best to draw and experiment?
<TheRainbowDash> Umm, hello there heythere! (waves and hugs)
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: You ignored me last night. :|
<CrazyCherry> Hiya heythere!!!
<dishwasher_EXTREME> dues ex i see

<heythere> my day has been going well, how about you guys?
<Scaturn> 08,01bee shoop de wabap
<StupidSexyCJ> Twi_Fi: a little of both, learning to structure is good, but experimenting helps you find ways that work for you
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Tired: Stop it. Scat means something entirely different to me and.... Disturbed! Listen to more Disturbed!
<Ingwaz> Twi_Fi: if you're confused about how somethign is done, suggest watching someone else draw something similar and tryign to learn how they do it from that
*ImOkayWithThis puts Ninjazz|Tired in the cool chair

<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: No, what event were you two doing anyway?
<Irish_Pony> GilDash: IM SORRY! :'( :'(:'(!!!
<GilDash> Ninjazz|Tired: Yeah, it doesn't ever mean music to me. I'm not fond of it. At all. :D

*GilDash|HulaHoop drinks a bottle of cider in front of ImOkayWithThis. "Want one?" ;)
<CCCP> StupidSexyCJ: O_O
<ImOkayWithThis> alexxm: Gildy won't drink my cider that i made
<derpy_pony> I just stumbled over the word "smerious" and the urban dictionary entry about it is a bit lacking. As there should be a few native english speakers here, I'd like to know the exact implications of this term.
<CrazyCherry|Hulahoop> Irish_Pony: Oi! :D
<ImOkayWithThis> GilDash|HulaHoop: thats applejuice
<alexxm> i will TheRainbowDash its also easier as i don't have to stay up until at least 4 in the morning
<Irish_Pony> Hmmmm...Cider with whiskey....huh....
<Spell-of-Gaming> When I found the thread in /arch/, I was like waaaaa-. I didn't even remembered it existed.
<Twi_Fi> Ingwaz: but yeah, about drawing, I guess I should start off somewhere, like using shapes, instead of thinking I can immediately draw the thing I have in mind.
<TheRainbowDash> alexxm: Oh, cool then.
<GilDash|HulaHoop> ImOkayWithThis: ... You're impossible. :D
<alexxm> i'll have it ImOkayWithThis
*StupidSexyCJ likes CCCP because his chat name is easier to type
*Irish_Pony mixes Cider with whiskey and drinks it.....
<String_Shredder> derpy_pony: i have been speaking english my whole life and i have no idea what that word is
<ImOkayWithThis> GilDash|HulaHoop: i am not...
<Irish_Pony> O_O
<GilDash|HulaHoop> Irish_Pony: That's crazy talk! One step up and it'll just be a slop-bucket!
<CCCP> i cant be here for the movie night again :'(

<GilDash|HulaHoop> TheRainbowDash: I know. :D
*CrazyCherry|Hulahoop smacks GilDash|HulaHoop with a pillow.
<Twi_Fi> StupidSexyCJ: You don't need to type the whole name of somepony you want to talk to.
*alexxm downs ImOkayWithThis's cider
<TheRainbowDash> CrazyCherry|Hulahoop: It is pillow fight again?
<coyboy> what is the movie tonite
<derpy_pony> ok, maybe it's something regional or a sociolect
<Irish_Pony> GilDash|HulaHoop: I have just tasted...the greatest whiskey...i have ever made....
*GilDash|HulaHoop flings pillow at CrazyCherry|Hulahoop.
<ehm> derpy_pony: Even native speakers aren't familiar with most slang on UD. Many of the entries are very localized or made-up inside-jokes.
<Twi_Fi> StupidSexyCJ: Instead start typing a few letters of the name and hit tab until the desired name appears.
<CrazyCherry|Hulahoop> TheRainbowDash: Yes.
<ImOkayWithThis> hey GilDash|HulaHoop don't change the subject
<GilDash|HulaHoop> Irish_Pony: Oh goddesses, you want me to try don't you. :D
<StupidSexyCJ> Twi_FI: dat helpful hint
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, awesome then CrazyCherry|Hulahoop! (gets my pillow guns)
<derpy_pony> thx anyway :)
<GilDash|HulaHoop> ImOkayWithThis: Besides, it's a special cider. Spiced apple and honey. :)
<Irish_Pony> GilDash|HulaHoop: 1. God 2. Yes ;)
<PrincessLuna> Alright everypony I'll be on here and there but definitely back on Tuesday night :)

<CCCP> TheRandomkid321: ?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> dabadoodabadoodabadoodabadoodooda
<ImOkayWithThis> GilDash|HulaHoop: oh so my cider isn't special enough for you?
<GilDash|HulaHoop> ImOkayWithThis: Look, I'll have some if you really want. I just don't want to waste it is all. :)
<TheRainbowDash> (shakes off the pillow feathers, and laughs a little, before shooting pillow out of my gun at CrazyCherry|Hulahoop's head, at least 5 of them)

<Chimera> Espbreon?
<Sumica> 00,10perhaps later RainBowJack

*Chimera transform into eevee
<Chimera> THERE
<alexxm> i would pay to watch this

<St_Gullick> I fear that's only a very well fan-made Trailer
<Mish> Oh my god epicness
<Woodenfan> FLUTTERSHY IS AWESOME
<derpy_pony> this was what I expected after episode 1. one episode later the villain was defeated and all was over
<cachi01> i saw a c
<valoreins|Drawing> MLP-FiM the Movie!
<Twi_Fi> yay
<MadSurge> Meh, this trailer's got nothing on the show itself.
<Mish> they...will save the bronies to? that would make a good movie
<RustyMeat> Frienschips
<Kandarihu> To think. Lauren Faust wanted this to be something like this, too.
<GilDash> If any non-brony looks at this and isn't at least intrigued, they truly have no soul. :)
<Skylands> 10hee
<Xanbreon> By our powers combined
<ImOkayWithThis|Derp> is ninjazz asleep?
<Om> GilDash: Or they don't like cartoons.
<Woodenfan> I'm still wondering if they'll make an actual movie. Season 3 has recurring villains, AND John de Lancie was one of those who confirmed season 3. RETURN OF DISQORD?
<MadSurge> GilDash, didn't see you there :D
<Mish> this...will play at the end of the world
<GilDash> Om: Irrelevant. :D
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<Mish> When december comes along...
<Kandarihu> GilDash: problem is, if any non-brony sees this first and checks out MLP afterwards, they will have no chance to ever become a brony.
<TheRainbowDash> Holy fuck, that was possibly the most epic trailer that I've seen, and will ever see in my lifetime. I commend it for of highest awards. I'll gladly pay to see this movie, and enjoy it such. What a trailer. (10/10):)
<Radu> Villains don't return, cause that would be odd
<Chimera> xD
<Twi_Fi> yay
<Woodenfan> now what?
<RustyMeat> Whats the name of this trailer?
<Kandarihu> This is more epic than the series itself.
<alexxm> how come Kandarihu
