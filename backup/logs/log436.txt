<GilDash> panda: It's just annoying when you get synonyms for things that you're not aware of for things you actuall know.
<Kandarihu> I honestly hope Nittany_Discord takes over the stream until the encore of Rocky Horror Picture Show.

*Tovler is too shy to play Portal 2 co-op.

<LunaTheBeloved> So.....................
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's with the kickstarter.

<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<GilDash> Airpuff: I'm not impressed. :D
<Hackurn> 08,01i was proved wrong.
<Soital> 12NightSeas is no longer NightSeas no more? =o
<BlueFlare> 02I was just seeing if I wanted to use that name, so that doesn't really count
<Ponies47> Great now I think a boot to the head is gonna be the next best thing on bronystate :|

<PrincessLuna> Scoot-Scootaloo: Do you play on xbox?
<otakon> Kandarihu|H8s2Clean: no, it's free. Plus no one would buy it if they charged for it. That would mean they sold you an incomplete product, which is against the law under false advertising.

<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: me too
<XAX> Afternoon all.
<PrincessLuna> I hate Virginia lol
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> You know, I honestly that if we're going to declare EA the worst gaming publisher, it would have to be for something more than just ME3. It can include the ME3 ending. And the Online passes. And the Origin DRM.
<superretroworld> Scoot-Scootaloo: special edition?
<Maid_Ponies47> Dusts XAX
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames and implodes, again

<WallDives> I do live in a state that borders canada though.
<RAWRity> Scoot-Scootaloo: see, you're going after this with the wrong mentality. To game companies, you aren't BUYING the game, you're LISCENSING it for recreational use.
<DaringMaid> Me and SuperBrony64 Californians :)
<DerpStar> EA killed Westwood Studios
<Barbetos> is dat some daft punk tron?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Special editions are nice too~

<GilDash|Maid> Kandarihu|H8s2Clean: Isn't that enough?
<WallDives> PrincessLuna: NOPE!
<panda> kirzstryfe, you must be using a waccom. forsome reason other pads dont get the "pressure sensitive" aspects in sai :/
<YOitzGEEZUS> Bungie kinda hurt me a little
<Shane377> DerpStar: i pmed u a vid
<PrincessLuna> WallDives: Aww :(
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Even Activision doesn't do online passes.

<YOitzGEEZUS> EA does and it's stupid
<superretroworld> bungie only made one good game, halo
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> Those things combined, perhaps it is enough.
<CriticKitten> They have singlehandedly obliterated multiple franchises with executive meddling.
<Sally> Lol, I used to like to draw & write as well but it seems like I was only any good when I was taking a class for it.
<CriticKitten> And killed good studios. >_>
<PrincessCadence> Luna. Just to let you no i tricked you with all this. I am actully... Your sister Celestia!

<Midnight_Tempest> we complaining about EA again? yay!
<WallDives> I guess I should say state that "technically" borders it. not that its at all relevant to DerpStar's situation.
<YOitzGEEZUS> superretroworld yea, but, the new halo looks bad
<Shane377> DerpStar: did u like it lol

<nickstr> so I would not have to wait a damned eternety to get it from China
<CCCP> DID DID I HEAR A PING???!
<GilDash|Maid> Maid_Discord: Ouch! I'm trying to get things done here? :|
<drfsupercenter> 03I could send you mind
*DaringMaid is watchin a 10 hour minecraft video
<drfsupercenter> 03*mine
*Airpuff got licked o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03and order a new one LOL
<GilDash|Maid> CCCP: Have another. :)
<Phobos2390> cccp now you did
<WallDives> Phobos2390: tbh, they are, they're done with making a large batch of pokes for a while.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01No. You're forcing someone to be a maid.
<Maid_Ponies47> Nice catch! OmegaMaidtroidBrony! When he grabbed me he threw me out the window the glass cut my wings! I can't fly now! :(
<Maid_Discord> 11,01That's wrong.
*GilDash|Maid finishes pushing Airpuff into the uniform.
<CCCP> GilDash|Maid: :3
<GilDash|Maid> Maid_Discord: He doesn't know what he's missing. :p
<CCCP> Phobos2390: C:
*Airpuff is in uniform.....
<nickstr> that whole battling past gym leaders thing sold me to an extent on Black 2 or White 2
*OmegaMaidtroidBrony sics the Metroids on Shane377
*Maid_Discord 11,01takes uniform off of Airpuff
*Airpuff takes it off again...
<nickstr> but I still can't stand the fifth generation creatures either
*Airpuff Sighs
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Mwuahahahahaha
*pikoBarber gives Airpuff extensions and braids them.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03hacking first-gens in there is the only acceptable way to play
<Maid_Ponies47> *Runs back up the stairs with bleeding wings*
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Only two ways to kill my pets >: D
<drfsupercenter> 03or if you know someone who's beaten the game
<drfsupercenter> 03import yours to theirs and trade
<CCCP> I want moar Russia
<pikoBarber> With guns and swords?
<GilDash|Maid> Airpuff: Aw... You looked good in it as well... :(
*Airpuff stares down at the ground
<Maid_Ponies47> Charges at Shane377 and bucks him into the wall at full force
<Phobos2390> WallDives: what I want is a Super Smash Bros pokemon game where you could map your attacks to certain buttons like in zelda. I would also like it if it were a 3d game. It would be a complete change but it would freshen the series up.
*Shane377 jumps up
*Shane377 turns invisibl
<Shane377> invisible
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Watch out for the Metroids Maid_Ponies47
<Maid_Ponies47> Grabs Shane377
*GilDash|Maid kisses Airpuff.
<Phobos2390> wow...I didn't know that it would be that long
<nickstr> plus it proves that the people involved with the video games (unlike the TV show people) actually care about and acknowledge the fact that Pokemon existed more than five years ago
<WallDives> Phobos2390: thats called Shin Megami tensei Devil summoner.
*pikoBarber spikes up the hair of Phobos2390.
*Airpuff blushes
*Shane377 counter grabs Maid_Ponies47 and slices Maid_Discord wings off
<Phobos2390> WallDives: Huh?
<CCCP> I dont normally count, but when i do.. i count to potatoe
*Airpuff kisses GilDash|Maid Back
<Champion_of_Harmony> urem....
*Shane377 runs off after cutting Maid_Ponies47 wings
<Champion_of_Harmony> wtf?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Ow.
<drfsupercenter> 03sorta, but they still restrict you from getting any older ones before beating the entire game which is retarded
*LunaTheMaid pokes her head in chat
*Maid_Discord 11,01explodes
*LunaTheMaid pokes it back out
<Maid_Ponies47> Has no wings and can't fly and is bleeding to death
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Hi LunaTheMaid
<GilDash|Maid> Airpuff: I-I wasn't expecting that...
<WallDives> Phobos2390: they had a game ideal like that. Its been done, albit without the pvp interactivity. also, Masuda doesnt wat to do that.
<Airpuff> Cant i defenestrate shane377???? =D
<superretroworld> ive been reading this fml blogs, there actually really interesting
<WallDives> want^
*pikoBarber give LunaTheMaid a super fast haircut before she has time to escape.
<LunaTheMaid> Cello Maid_Discord
<Shane377> lol wut Airpuff
<Champion_of_Harmony> anyway in the first game your guy had to catch either zekrom or reshiram because thats how you progressed through the story.
<nickstr> which is where the save dumper comes in
<Airpuff> defenestrates Shane377. There.
<drfsupercenter> 03"Finally, no more Zubats in caves" *sees Woobats instead* ... congrats Nintendo, you changed a few letters, would you like a medal?
<LunaTheMaid> pikoBarber........I'm gonna kill you...
<WallDives> Champion_of_Harmony: yep.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's still the same game
<nickstr> I can hack my save file to have first and second generation creatures
<drfsupercenter> 03just different stuff
<CCCP> I would like to elect my dog to the senate. He could do a better job.﻿
<GilDash|Maid> Airpuff: You'll make a mess. You'll have to clean it up. And you'll do it in maid gear. :|
<Shane377> Airpuff: dafuq is defenstrates?
<Maid_Ponies47> Is dieing on the floor and needs new wings :'(
<GilDash|Maid> CCCP: I could do a better job whacked out of my head on booze.
<pikoBarber> But LunaTheMaid... I'm the one holding the scizzors above your head. I insist you take this haircut...
*OmegaMaidtroidBrony takes Maid_Ponies47 to the medical bay
<LunaTheMaid> pikoBarber....Tonight....you die....
<Champion_of_Harmony> then in 2 they are somehow absorbed into Kyurem....how if they were with the frist guy how did that shit happen?
<superretroworld> Maid_Ponies47: how can we do that?
<Airpuff> Shane377 a verb for throwing something or someone out of a window =D
*Shane377 flys out from the front door and stabs Maid_Ponies47 in the neck
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Comparing bats in terms of names rather than in-game annoyance?
<Champion_of_Harmony> it makes no sence!
<CCCP> GilDash|Maid: ikr
<Champion_of_Harmony> not to mention a huge slap in the face by nintendo
*LunaTheMaid knocks the scissors out of pikoBarber's hands
<LunaTheMaid> Don't nobody touch my hair...
*Shane377 turns invisible and slices OmegaMaidtroidBrony achielles tendons and runs away
<drfsupercenter> 03how are Woobats any less annoying
<Maid_Ponies47> Has been stabbed and is bleeding even more,
*MaidWarrior takes scissors from LunaTheMaid and runs
<Phobos2390> WallDives: I was thinking that the arena would be more like pokepark wii. I would like it to get rid of the stupid four attacks only rule and have all of your learned attacks available, but you could only have 3-4 attacks out at a time.
<drfsupercenter> 03they're bats that show up constantly in caves
<WallDives> Champion_of_Harmony: they could have been released. N was borrowing a legend, it would make sense for the PC to release the other. or Kyurem coul absorb the power of the one N released.
<Airpuff> This chatroom has become a battlefield o.o
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where are my Metroids? They should've siphoned your soul out by now!
<drfsupercenter> 03therefore it's the exact same thing, just "new"
<pikoBarber> Well LunaTheMaid... It was nice knowing you. But, I think you need an afro. *Gives LunaTheMaid an afro*. There.
<Shane377> lol Airpuff
<LunaTheMaid> ........
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Riiight. Zubats were annoying because they were faster and could confuse pokemon.
*GilDash|Maid restrains pikoBarber.
<LunaTheMaid> ...........
*Maid_Discord 11,01dusts OmegaMaidtroidBrony
<LunaTheMaid> ..............
<drfsupercenter> 03say what?
<GilDash|Maid> LunaTheMaid: Please, allow me...
<drfsupercenter> 03you just hit the Run button
<SlurryMoon> 3....
<drfsupercenter> 03it exists for a reason
<SlurryMoon> 3<<
<Shadow_Lugia> 6They're faster.
*OmegaMaidtroidBrony has been dusted and rejuvenated
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: Come on, you... :|
*pikoBarber is pleasently surprised by GilDash|Maid.
*LunaTheMaid pulls our a razor
<MrBen> ...did I come in at a bad time?
<Maid_Ponies47> OmegaMaidtroidBrony; Thank you but I'll never fly agian because Shane377 took my wings :(
<Chimera> huh
<Champion_of_Harmony> no N was sticking with his because if you beat the game you seem him flying into the distance with his pokemon
<CCCP> rate your day! 0/10
<Chimera> that promo
<drfsupercenter> 03they're almost always much lower level than you are
*LunaTheMaid shaves pikoBarber bald
<Chimera> is actually pretty awesome
<Phobos2390> JUST BEND THE SLURRY WOMAN!!!! (katara slaps him with the slurry)
<Biglaw|Writing> My day 6/10
<Shane377> Maid_Ponies47: and i stabbed u in the neck
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Indeed, Chim. :D
<Chimera> but it looks more like a different animé altogether
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: ... You deserve that. :)
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> We'll do to you what we did to Ridley Maid_Ponies47
<Biglaw|Writing> o yeah I'm BAAACK!
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03that's my point
<Chimera> which I can tolerate
<Phobos2390> my day 4/10
<GilDash|Maid> Biglaw|Writing: Whooo!
*MrBen slooowly backs away.
<pikoBarber> Waha! The joke is on you! I'm filled with play-dough and can grow my hair back instantly! WAHA!
<panda> Biglaw|Writing: welcome back ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not even Pokémon anymore, so why do they keep calling it that?
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Wb Biglaw
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Except it is.
<Chimera> because United States and kids
<Maid_Ponies47> OmegaMaidtroidBrony: Which is?
<Biglaw> I actually was playing Minecraft
<Biglaw> :p
<drfsupercenter> 03>Japan
<Chimera> and OMG POKEEEEEE MONZ
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: Playdough sets at a high temperature...
<Chimera> Japane too
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Robotical enhancement ofc!
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Biglaw was writing in Minecraft.
<WallDives> Phobos2390: that sounds like a okay idea, but it isnt pokemon. the problem is that its a JRPG, and by default are formulaic. granted B/W's story is better, but the mechanics need to stay the same, less you risk alienating sales.
<Chimera> cutesy names and crap like that
*Airpuff gives Biglaw a Diamond =3
<drfsupercenter> 03they should call it Capsule Monsters instead :P
<Biglaw> Maid_Discord yeah.... WRITING
<Chimera> If Nintendo really wanted to I'm sure they'd probably rename it
<Chimera> heh
<LunaTheMaid> pikoBarber, I have a flamethrower if neccassassary(Screw speeling)
*Biglaw wubs teh diamond Airpuff gave me
<CCCP> im sooo paranoid :(
<superretroworld> Maid_Ponies47: can twilight give a repair?
<drfsupercenter> 03(that was supposed to be the name for Pokémon in the beginning)_
<pikoBarber> Well then GilDash|Maid, I'm going to need a lunchbox, some ice packs, and tons more play-dough.
<Chimera> then they'd name it CapMon in the US
<MrBen> (Is it just me or is nobody broadcasting anything?)
<panda> ATTENTION BRONIES: WE HAVE EXCEEEDED THE 40K MARK. GOOD JOB!
<superretroworld> CCCP: why?
*Shane377 as Maid_Ponies47 is bleeding out Shane377 takes Maid_Ponies47 s wings
<Chimera> and people would think Capcom
<Chimera> and they don't want that
<Chimera> ;P
<Biglaw> YAY!
<drfsupercenter> 03you're thinking too hard
*LunaTheMaid heals Maid_Ponies47
*Airpuff falls back as he sees LunaTheMaid 's Flamethrower o.o
<Maid_Ponies47> Doctors got it under control Shane377 I'm now in the hospital wingless.
<MrBen> (Because I'm not getting anything from the broadcast to the left and I'm not sure if its just my end or not)
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> He's gonna get new wings :3
<CCCP> superretroworld: I ALWAYS AM IT SUCKS :(
<WallDives> MrBen: there is no stream.
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: You'll have to handle the heat first... ;)
<LunaTheMaid> ^
<Renard> http://pentastudios.net/contents/games/wim/WIM.swf
<MrBen> AH. Okay, I THOUGHT there wasn't
<YOitzGEEZUS> welp, I'm going to get off for awhile, I'm going to draw some ponies....Later everyone! later discord!
<cachi01> WIM?
<pikoBarber> The stream is down, MrBen, the only thing that matters now is Maid Hour. Or in my case, barber hour!
<Maid_Ponies47> LunaTheMaid: Doctors have taken care of me. But Now I don't have any wings :'(
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back.......how was HACKERS?
<CCCP> bye YOitzGEEZUS
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> The kind that require the Plasma Burn off!
<drfsupercenter> 03and Shadow_Lugia, if you change the creatures, change the characters, even change basic game mechanics like the fact that TMs aren't supposed to be reusable... how is it still Pokémon besides sharing a common name?
<Phobos2390> WallDives: Fine, make it a spin-off game like pokepark wii.
<drfsupercenter> 03and the fact you still run around collecting badges
<cachi01> Dark92Enigma: mhhhhhhmm 5/10
<superretroworld> CCCP: do you wanna talk about it?
<Shane377> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4761/
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> ....
<Shane377> to all ponies
<Chimera> um
<Chimera> guys
<pikoBarber> Oh GilDash|Maid... You'll have to handle a mustache. *Gives GilDash|Maid a handlebar mustache.* WAHA!
*LunaTheMaid magiks up new, better wings and puts them on Maid_Ponies47
<Chimera> when did Bianca have glasses
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> I meant to say Plasma Beam
<CCCP> superretroworld: NO!
<Chimera> drf
<Dark92Enigma> How did it finished cachi01?
<WallDives> Phobos2390: there is a spinnoff game coming in June. (pokemon conquest)
<MrBen> Ah. Alright. I was curious. The only reason I ask is because we've been having some issues here with my internet provider--mainly with phone and TV tonight but we've had intermittent internet problems and I just thought...
<Chimera> what's pokémon besides catching monsters in spheres
<Shadow_Lugia> 6So... G/S?
<superretroworld> CCCP: sorry, just thought i could help
<Chimera> nothing
<Phobos2390> WallDives: And besides, it would feel more like the anime battles.
<twilight_sprinkler> Renard: awsuuuum
<Chimera> Lawl
*GilDash|Maid sets fire to mustache and extingushes it before it does any more damage.
<Litwick> Seriously, whoever's streaming right now is awesome!
<Maid_Ponies47> Thank you LunaTheMaid
<MaidWarrior> CCCP: Why is your day so bad?
<drfsupercenter> 03what about GS
<SlurryLuna> 3x3
<MrBen> That, you know, it might be something on my end. I just had to ask.
<MrBen> Thanks!
<Chimera> anyway when did Bianca get glasses
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: I don't think so. :|
<LunaSlurry> Anytime
<Shane377> Litwick: no one is
<panda> I CANT PLAY WAITING IS MAGIC!
<drfsupercenter> 03when Nintendo decided to jump the shark, that's when
<cachi01> Dark92Enigma: they manage to kill the davici virus and lots of wubs
<Litwick> That's the joke.
*Maid_Discord 11,01stirs SlurryLuna
<Skylands> 10[21:39] <Chimera> when did Bianca have glasses
<CCCP> superretroworld: its okay *hugs*
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Changed game mechanics, changed pokemon, changed characters.
<WallDives> Phobos2390: we need a cel-shaded Pokemon Stadium 3, with full gym leader/E4 rosters and different cups.
<Shane377> Litwick: face hoof
<Skylands> 10Helps the new professor
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> Waiting is Magic?
<Champion_of_Harmony> ill get it just because ive been playing since I was, 10
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03SlurryLuna... sounds like a kick ass milkshake!
<CCCP> MaidWarrior: it always is
<drfsupercenter> 03except, G/S didn't get rid of gen 1
<LunaSlurry> Heheh
<Maid_Ponies47> Is realeased from the hosiptal with a scar on his neck and with new and better wings.
<drfsupercenter> 03they were still there from the beginning
<Dark92Enigma> cachi01 and how was Crash x Boom
*MrBen notices that Everlasting_Joy is not present, and is sad.
<Skylands> 10Juniper
<MaidWarrior> ScootaMexiMaid: You man kick plot?
<Shane377> CCCP: sounds like a designer drug
<MaidWarrior> mean*
*GilDash|Maid takes the clippers from pikoBarber's hooves.
<drfsupercenter> 03and not "Let's just completely isolate the thing so that you don't even know there WERE earlier games unless you were around for them"
<pikoBarber> Oh GilDash|Maid... I made each strand of hair in your mustache a pure strain of carbon that's so closely packed it's like diamond! WAHA!
<superretroworld> CCCP: hug
<cachi01> DaringMaid: i didnt watch that
<cachi01> Dark92Enigma*
<cachi01> lol
*MrBen sighs. "Ah well. I'll see him tomorrow anyway. Was just hoping to catch him tonight."
<Shane377> i gotta question
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hey, G/S's Gen.1 was only available after the first half of the game.
<Maid_Ponies47> Flys into the clouds and just forgets about the whole thing with Shane377
<MrBen> Alright, I'm out. Peace.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01SlurryLuna is a milkshake?
*MaidWarrior runs while holding scissors
<Phobos2390> WallDives: But is pokemon conquest a SSB like game?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm talkinga bout the creatures
<CCCP> Shane377: lol
*GilDash|Maid rips mustache off.
*CCCP hugs superretroworld
<drfsupercenter> 03you still see Zubats in caves, etc
<DaringMaid> cachi01: didnt watch what?
<Aurora> 6ugh
<Shane377> IF WERE ALL PONIES what type of ponies r we?
<Aurora> 6what's this now?
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: I'm not playing games anymore.
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03LunaSlurry... sounds like a Slurpy!
<Champion_of_Harmony> and apperently something is covering the world in ice....lovely
<LunaSlurry> x3
<Kosoveon> a wonderful discourse, of course
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> I would be a.... Gambling machine
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 13Lilligant.
*GilDash|Maid chases pikoBarber with clippers.
*Maid_Discord 11,01passes a LunaSlurry to ScootaMexiMaid
<WallDives> Phobos2390: no, its Nobunaga's ambition. SSBB is SSBB, different engine woned by a different company.
<Dark92Enigma> DaringMaid the ending of HACKERS
<MaidWarrior> SlurryLuna x LunaSlurry
<pikoBarber> Ah... GilDash
<Shadow_Lugia> 6DRF commenting how he hates the new games again.
<WallDives> or SSB, rather.
<Shane377> MaidWarrior: dat ship
<superretroworld> Maid_Ponies47: your welcome, i killed rd and cut off the wings for you, now you do the sonic rainboom
<pikoBarber> ... Maid vs. Barber... The age old battle...
<DaringMaid> Yeah me neither
<Aurora> 6which is fine, everyone has their own opinion
<WallDives> owned^
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03Let's see if I can think of a clever pun...
<pikoBarber> ENGARDE!
<WallDives> wow, I cant type.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6When I said that I'm hyped for the game and didn't ask for his opinion. :/
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: When has that ever happened?
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03Sluna! Lurry!
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> If I were a pony, I'd probably be a unicorn
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm mainly saying that BW2 are so far from the original games that I fail to see why they're still calling it Pokémon
*Shane377 stalks Maid_Ponies47 from a distance
<Aurora> 6because it's pokemon?
<drfsupercenter> 03how so, though?
<pikoBarber> Like, 2 seconds ago, GilDash|Maid, don't you remember?
<Aurora> 6it's not what YOU remember pokemon to be
<cachi01> i would be a pegasus
<Aurora> 6it's pokemon though
<DaringMaid> ScootaMexiMaid: did you hear about that new broom?
*GilDash|Maid retrieves sopping wet mop.
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Aren't barbers supposed to be in quartets pikoBarber?
<SniperEliteShane377> .
<drfsupercenter> 03if I draw a random blob, can I call that a Pokémon?
<drfsupercenter> 03just by name?
<Aurora> 6the basic rules behind it are thill there
<drfsupercenter> 03an d nothing else?
<Aurora> 6...
<CCCP> If i were a pony, I'd BE A PONY
<cachi01> or alicorn if i had the chane
<WallDives> I'd be a sea serpent.
<Aurora> 6no
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: Back off or I use the mop!
<Phobos2390> WallDives: But that was what I was talking about. How would you like a battle system based off of pokepark's battle system?
<cachi01> hance
<cachi01> CHANCE
*Airpuff Conjurers forth two magic bubbles around pikoBarber and GilDash|Maid making them unable to leave it "stop it you two" *smiles*
<drfsupercenter> 03that anime promo looks like a completely different series altogether
<Biglaw> Im baaack with TOAST!
<Aurora> 6it would have to be incorporated into the series, you'd be able to catch it in a pokeball, train it, battle others with it, earn badges
<MaidWarrior> I have a special mop. Its also a sword!
<cachi01> TOAST HERE
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03Yes I have! :O
<Aurora> 6the fact they're adding more doesn't make them /not/ pokemon
<DaringMaid> Its really sweeping the nation
<Aurora> 6they're just expanding
*SniperEliteShane377 jumps up to the cloud dat Maid_Ponies47 is on
<pikoBarber> That was long before the war OmegaMaidTroidBrony... My companions are all dead now... But i left them with mustaches embeded in their skulls.
<WallDives> Phobos2390: meh. I probably wouldnt like it tbh. if I want zelda, I'd play zelda.
*GilDash|Maid looks at Airpuff with a sly grin as he breaks down the barrier and slowly walks towards him.
<Chimera> OH MY GOD
<Chimera> DRF
<DaringMaid> ^-^
<Chimera> YOU
<Chimera> WE
<Chimera> WERE RIGHT
<Aurora> 6different series, different styles
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Whoa, whoa, whoa Biglaw! Toast leaves one big mess if not handled properly :/
<Chimera> THE NEXT TEAM IS NINJAS
*Chimera shot
<Maid_Ponies47> Superretroworld: WHAT! NO! WHY DID YOU KILL DASHIE! PRINCESS LUNA GAVE ME NEW AND BETTER WINGS! DASHIE WAS MY BEST FRIEND! :'(
<WallDives> also, havent played pokepark.
<xax|iPod> Back2school
*SniperEliteShane377 says "hello,"and ties Maid_Ponies47 hooves and puts a bag over Maid_Ponies47 head
<Kosoveon> I thought the promo looked really enticing.
<xax|iPod> Later all
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Bai xax|iPod
<Champion_of_Harmony> I just wish they come out with a new pokemon mystery dungeon...
<Aurora> 6you can't expect a single series that's gone on for almost 800 episodes to keep the same animation style
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what Chimera
<pikoBarber> Bye xax|iPod!
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03If I were a pony, I'd be a horse
<Biglaw> OmegaMaidtroidBrony I am aaster of one handed toast eating.
*SniperEliteShane377 takes Maid_Ponies47 to panda
<pikoBarber> ... Yes.
<WallDives> Champion_of_Harmony: I wish they would too, but chunsoft doesnt want to atm.
<Kosoveon> I'm anxious to see how that ties into the story
<superretroworld> Maid_Ponies47: lol just kidding :D
*Airpuff teleports behind GilDash|Maid and kisses
*SniperEliteShane377 and hangs Maid_Ponies47 upside down
<MaidWarrior> If I were a pony, Id be a maid pony
<Phobos2390> WallDives: What? If I wanted to play zelda? I was talking about a more live action pokemon game. A deep fighter like kid icarus. With customizable attacks.
<Kosoveon> and Cheren as a gym leader YES
<Aurora> 6and how is it that people complain about ash so much and they want spin offs again, and suddenly people are pissed that this is what they got lol
<Champion_of_Harmony> dammit
<pikoBarber> GilDash|Maid, this is not over yet!
<Maid_Ponies47> Breaks rope and Flys away
*GilDash|Maid slides sopping wet mop into Airpuff's face instead.
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> I better not catch a toast mess over there
<drfsupercenter> 03I never complained about Ash
<drfsupercenter> 03o_O
<Aurora> 6not you
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Spin-offs?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Of the anime>?
<Aurora> 6but I've seen a lot of it
<Shadow_Lugia> 6->
<drfsupercenter> 03OK, well that's what I'm saying.
<Aurora> 6yes....
*SniperEliteShane377 jumps on Maid_Ponies47 and knocks him out
<Aurora> 6like pokemon chronicles
*MaidWarrior gives OmegaMaidtroidBrony a bath
<cachi01> if i pony a were i were be a would
<drfsupercenter> 03you guys don't care about my opinion, then I have the right to not care about anyone else's opinoins. :P
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> If I do some pony is gonna get the bees....
<drfsupercenter> 03*opinions
<Aurora> 6dude
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Weell, if it was more plot-heavy, I'd like it. :)
<Aurora> 6I do
*Airpuff Smiles and pours some pepper in GilDash|Maids nose
<Aurora> 6I'm curious how it's not pokemon
<Aurora> 6because I just explained how it is
<DaringMaid> I was wondering why the baseball was getting bigger then it hit me
*pikoBarber pops bubble with titanium alloy scizzors and uses super blowdryer to create a tornado that wreaks havic on the field seperating GilDash|Maid and Airpuff!
<Aurora> 6your definition of pokemon isn't based on anything lol
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> One does not give an Omega Metroid a bath
<drfsupercenter> 03well it just seems like everybody attacks me for saying something
*SniperEliteShane377 places Maid_Ponies47 in a impenetrable chair and chains Maid_Ponies47 hooves to the chair
<GilDash|Maid> MaidWarrior: I can not stop reading you as MechWarrior. :D
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> *One does not simply
<WallDives> Phobos2390: it sounded closer to zelda, from what you were describing, sorry. and what you're saying sounds like a concept or a tech demo. interesting, but not probable.
<drfsupercenter> 03and it's like, OK... so gushing over something is allowed here, but saying you don't like it is all the sudden not?
<Biglaw> OmegaMaidtroidBrony You won't :p
<Aurora> 6no, I was defending my opinion against an opinion that had no backing
<drfsupercenter> 03Yay no more freedom of speech
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<Maid_Ponies47> Sorry didn't work! *Twilight Sparkle teliports me out* to a remote location
*SniperEliteShane377 i see u got ur wings back Maid_Ponies47
*GilDash|Maid simple sneezes as he is twirlled around pikoBarber's tornado.
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/mXHiP.jpg
<Aurora> 6I already said that people can have their own opinions
<EpicPwnTime3> hai everybody im back
<Aurora> 6no need to get butt hurt about me explaining mine
<MaidWarrior> Its maid hour, we need to clean bronystate, not destroy it!
<pikoBarber> Hi EpicPwnTime3!
<pikoBarber> I love you!
<drfsupercenter> 03OK, well I'm saying the fact that gen 5 is the first one since EVER that basically elimiated the older generations altogether, unless you completely beat the game
<Aurora> 6you know why they did that right?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Sometimes, you have to know when to fold 'em.
<Aurora> 6cuz that's also been explained 5 thousand times
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: I love you. ;)
<Maid_Ponies47> Sorry SniperEliteShane377 Twilight teleiported me out of there when you wern't looking so HA! :D
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> o hai EpicPwnTime3 didn't c ya thar behind that glorious link by Shizuka
<twilight_sprinkler> Shizuka: lol
<EpicPwnTime3> and the stream still isnt working, so lets all talk.
*SniperEliteShane377 teleports with Maid_Ponies47 and just as he slips away, cuts off one of Maid_Ponies47 s wings
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: Now let me out of this tornado. :|
<pikoBarber> MaidWarrior is right... GilDash|Maid... I'm sorry.. Let us work together as maid and barber...
<twilight_sprinkler> Shizuka: some christians are calling ponies evil
<superretroworld> MaidWarrior: that was already an hour ago
<Phobos2390> WallDives: I would either like that or a pokemon game where you could go to all of the regions (sinnoh, kanto, hoenn, unova, johto) and play through every single one of their stories in any order and travel between the regions all within one game.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01SniperEliteShane377: Please stop the gore roleplay.
*SniperEliteShane377 ports back to his base with Maid_Ponies47 s wing
<drfsupercenter> 03<Shadow_Lugia> Sometimes, you have to know when to fold 'em. <- says the one who personally attacked me for not sharing your opinion >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03I never insulted anyone
<drfsupercenter> 03I just said I don't see how it's still POkémon
<WallDives> Phobos2390: I would as well.
*GilDash|Maid kisses pikoBarber.
<SniperEliteShane377> Maid_Discord: its not gore play im just killing Maid_Ponies47
<drfsupercenter> 03and all the sudden it's as if I said something blasphemous
<Champion_of_Harmony> that would be massive and awsome
<Biglaw> -_-
<cachi01> so if we all come together we know what to do
<MaidWarrior> Maids do not like gore, it makes a mess
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: I'm a lover, not a fighter anyhow. ;)
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> ^
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> ...
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03Same thing, really~
<Aurora> 6to a lot of people, this was the first generation where things were completely new. Earlier games kept reusing old pokemon over and over again while adding in their own, this was the first time that wasn't an option. PLUS it was based on a completely new continental region.
*pikoBarber kisses GilDash
<SniperEliteShane377> MaidWarrior: u dont say
<Maid_Discord> 11,01You're cutting wings off.
<WallDives> GilDash|Maid: bah, always fight!
*Biglaw eats toast
<cachi01> is there a stream atm?
<EpicPwnTime3> when a daddy pony and a mommy pony love each other very much, they have sex but the guy uses a condom all the time and girl isnt happy about it.
<Phobos2390> WallDives: Then again, that would mean that gamefreak couldn't ever release another pokemon game again...
<GilDash|Maid> Maid_Discord: Who is? We have to go mop up the blood!
<SniperEliteShane377> Maid_Discord: its only Maid_Ponies47 <-- has been a bad pony
<drfsupercenter> 03right, but that's so far removed that they could have just called it something else, couldn't they? :P
<pikoBarber> But WallDives, I'm a barber, and barbers are supposed to make people happy!
<WallDives> Phobos2390: again, you're right, thats why it probably hasnt been done.
<Aurora> 6no
<Aurora> 6because it's still pokemon
<Biglaw> pikoBarber AND bald!
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Well, you commented on refutable points. So I refuted them.
<drfsupercenter> 03because it's the same people making it?
*pikoBarber makes WallDives happy by giving him the long flowing hair he always wished for.
<Aurora> 6take all of the animals in japan
<drfsupercenter> 03that's really the only reason I see why it HAS to be called that
<Aurora> 6they're animals right?
<Ascendant> So
<Aurora> 6lets go to america
<Maid_Ponies47> Twilight teleports back takes my wing teleports back to me gives me a heal spell and I now have my wings back I join the others and we just have a good time
<WallDives> pikoBarber: then do that. I just fight because love is hasslesome.
<MaidWarrior> BALD! BALD!
<Aurora> 6those aren't animals?
<Ascendant> What's taking place here now?
<EpicPwnTime3> bai everybody!
<cachi01> BAAAAAALD
<Biglaw> MaidWarrior MY EYES!
<cachi01> bie EpicPwnTime3!!
<drfsupercenter> 03people trying to make me seem like a horrible person, as always.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Again with opinionated frictions.
*GilDash|Maid begins mopping blood off of the floor, not questioning why it is there.
*SniperEliteShane377 stalks Maid_Ponies47 from a distance with Maid_Ponies47 s wing on his back
<Ascendant> This is quite sad to read
<drfsupercenter> 03also Ascendant did you see what I PM'ed you last night
<EpicPwnTime3> Next time, we eat........uuuum.............nothing?
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Oh, and new B2W2 trailer, NS.
<Ascendant> Yes
<cachi01> its not blood sillyfilly its ketchup!!
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
*MaidWarrior washes all the blood off with a fire hose
<Ascendant> Hm, Quanyails?
<Aurora> 6pokemon is the collective term for the creatures in the show, monsters that can be captured and trained, there was never a given rule that there's couldn't be more
<Biglaw> EpicPwnTime3 Next time, we eat applejacks
<Ascendant> I took care of it drf
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> pikoBarber: http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5763652
*SniperEliteShane377 gives EpicPwnTime3 Maid_Ponies47 s wing eat dat lol
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Link above.
<Aurora> 6in fact it's always been said that there's more than people know of
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Or I can repost.
<Ascendant> eXAKR ragequitted on me though
<Aurora> 6that is the definition of pokemon
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<EpicPwnTime3> i beg yer pardon?
<pikoBarber> Next time, we eat Old Spice Shampoo.
<Kosoveon> I still think after a year's time that 5th gen is an improvement over the previous games in many aspects
<Kosoveon> and yet at it's heart it's still Pokemon
<SniperEliteShane377> lol nothing EpicPwnTime3 <_< >_>
<Litwick> Biglaw: Beg ur parden?
<CCCP> OmegaMaidtroidBrony: that hurt my ears :(
<EpicPwnTime3> OH! Ive got it!
<Ascendant> He was lke "don't tell me what to do" and said he wasn't in a good mood for that
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Sorry CCCP :<
<Aurora> 6I'm not making you out to be a horrible person, don't get all whiney about that. I'm simply responding to why you keep saying it's not pokemon anymore
<CCCP> its okay :)
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Ascendant> I told him I could always comply with that and ban him
<Biglaw> Litwick my bad, Apple Jacks
<Ascendant> so he ragequitted
<drfsupercenter> 03I wasn't referring to you, but Shadow_Lugia mainly.
<drfsupercenter> 03and LOL Ascendant
<Ascendant> came back later though
*SniperEliteShane377 throws Maid_Ponies47 s wing at OmegaMaidtroidBrony for hurting CCCP
<drfsupercenter> 03I still don't see what his problem is
<Phobos2390> anyway...who's seen the avengers?
<CCCP> :o
<Maid_Ponies47> SniperEliteShane377: SORRY! I aske dTwilight to use her magic to get my orginal wings back I now have them in my hoofs and I've hid them!
<drfsupercenter> 03I completely forgive him for saying he wants me dead, but apparently he still hates me?
<Ascendant> Well
*drfsupercenter is far too nice :/
<Biglaw> Phobos2390 I have :3
<Kosoveon> that Game Freak kept the spirit yet evolved some of the elements is an accomplishment
*OmegaMaidtroidBrony is uneffected.
<Ascendant> Just ignore it next time
<Aurora> 6I wasn't around for whatever eXAKR did, but apparently he's getting rather obsessive about holding grudges
<Ascendant> don't reply
*Shadow_Lugia 6blinks.
<pikoBarber> Oh, OmegaMaidtroidBrony, you can be in my quartet... Please?
<EpicPwnTime3> Next time, we eat POOOOOOOOOOOWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [In a can!]
*MaidWarrior takes wing from SniperEliteShane377 and sews it back on to Maid_Ponies47
<Ascendant> Aurora, I've noticed
*Shadow_Lugia 6sighs.
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant, he has me on ignore, so why's it even magger
<drfsupercenter> 03*matter
<panda> EpicPwnTime3: XD
<SniperEliteShane377> Maid_Ponies47: i burnt ur original ones tho
<Biglaw> EpicPwnTime3 Next time, we eat CUPCAKES!
<OmegaMetroidBarber> Alright I will
<Ascendant> He probably doesn't
<drfsupercenter> 03it's still not OK to harass someone like that though.
<pikoBarber> WUB WUB WUUUuuub.
<WallDives> bah, bad luck.
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why I showed YOU instead of just banning him
<cachi01> and---and so this guy enters and i was like hey and he was like Bitch u like ponies and i was like YEAH WHATEVER
<Aurora> 6the fact he has someone on ignore and still talks about the person is a violation of respect for any individual
<drfsupercenter> 03because that way it's a third party
*CCCP laughs because he is all that is evil in the world
<Ascendant> I know
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Aurora> 6that's what happened with sato several times
<PrincessLuna> I'm back
<drfsupercenter> 03that's why I'm making it a big deal
<Aurora> 6I would too
<Phobos2390> Biglaw: Yeah!
<Aurora> 6and eXAKR's my friend
<OmegaMetroidBarber> Oh eb PrincessLuna
<pikoBarber> GilDash|Maid! Join us in our quartet so that we may rule as barber and maid!
<OmegaMetroidBarber> *wb
<Maid_Ponies47> MaidWarrior Princess Luna gave me new and better ones I'm keeping them as a memory :)
<MaidWarrior> Maid hour is almost over
<drfsupercenter> 03I just don't get what the big deal is
<Aurora> 6I still think it's an offense that needs to be dealt with
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03I have done nothing productive all day :3
*SniperEliteShane377 shoots his M82A2 at Maid_Ponies47 and the bullets hits Maid_Ponies47 s hoof
<Ascendant> I suppose I'll have to deal with this the unsavoury way again
<drfsupercenter> 03he's basically turning me into a mortal enemy because I don't like things he likes.
<drfsupercenter> 03which is the most retarded reasoning I've ever heard, tbh
<Kosoveon> did something happen with eXAKR in my abscene? o_o
<GilDash|Maid> OmegaMetroidBarber: http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5763655
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<SheenaFox> Yes
*SniperEliteShane377 walks away never to be seen again
<Phobos2390> Anyway, so is there a stream at the moment?
<PrincessLuna> ScootaMexiMaid: Me either xD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Weeell, if you reason your dislikes, DRF...
<Maid_Ponies47> MaidWarrior: My orginal wings as a memory
<drfsupercenter> 03I *do*, Shadow_Lugia
<Biglaw|Maid> ScootaMexiMaid I went to school, and answered trivial canadian questions :p
<Airpuff> xDD
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Instead of saying 'it's not pokemon' and then say 'it's the same'.
<SheenaFox> Your way of phrasing your dislikes doesn't appeal to him
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: Do you get barber/maid quartets?
<WallDives> oh well. least you guys have mad my day a little better.
<Aurora> 6^that
<MaidWarrior> ewww canadians
<Aurora> 6thats something we've all told him
<pikoBarber> I'unno GilDash
<Aurora> 6but he doesn't get it
<Maid_Ponies47> SniperEliteShane377: I have a forcefield arond me!
*PrincessLuna hugs Airpuff repeatedly
<Aurora> 6but eXAKR still isn't going about this right
<Biglaw|Maid> MaidWarrior :O HOW DARE YOU
*CCCP noms Airpuff
*Maid_Discord 11,01sighs

<WallDives> dat link.
<Sally> :x oopsie.
<BronyCody> Helo evrybody!
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03And it makes me wonder...
<twilight_sprinkler> WallDives: eh ive seen worse
<Kosoveon> yeah if he's saying he wants drf dead or whatever that's just...overkill, even considering said person's personality
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkler: OH MY GAWD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Kosoveon> o.o
<Aurora> 6something I think everyone in this room needs to get into their heads, eXAKR included but he's not even here, if you voice a negative opinion, you WILL be countered at some point
<WallDives> so have I, but shrink dat link.
<Champion_of_Harmony> UGH im so BORED! *slides on belly like Sweetie bell*
<Aurora> 6that is the nature of opinions
<twilight_sprinkler> CCCP: notice theres also a "russian" in the title for some reason :P
<pikoBarber> I'm not!
<Shizuka> 13i would like to see if i'm capable of streaming l4d whiel playing with people
<Renard> http://ponykillerx.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4zgb4t
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03And the Forest will Echo with laughter...
<Biglaw|Maid> Champion_of_Harmony VROOM!
*Airpuff Yawns
<Shizuka> 13but i would not want it to go catastrophically wrong
<SheenaFox> I don't agree with eXAKR's way of ignoring you but [18:50:30] <%drfsupercenter> that's why I'm making it a big deal
*pikoBarber shaves Champion_of_Harmony.
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Sometimes I enjoy a good argument, if both sides are substantiated.
<twilight_sprinkler> Renard: thats quite epic too
<SheenaFox> isn't going to solve problems
<Phobos2390> Is it a bad idea to call impromtu a friend for no reason other than to talk to them?
<BronyCody> is nothign palying or is it jsut me?
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkler: yayayayayay!
<WallDives> its L4D, it will go catastrophically wrong.
<drfsupercenter> 03what do you mean by "even considering said person's personality", are you saying it's less bad to want ME dead instead of someone else? >_>
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03That would be the WORST POSSIBLE THING
<Champion_of_Harmony> hey no shaving
<Maid_Ponies47> Ignores Shane377 and walks away with the main 6 with old wings in hoofs and With new and awesome wings on my back. There so awesome Dashie is even jelious :)
*GilDash|Maid sweeps CCCP with brrom.

<Kosoveon> no
<drfsupercenter> 03then what was that comment for
*CCCP nomz GilDash|Maid
<Shizuka> 13whereas it fails miserably with portal 2
<twilight_sprinkler> cachi01: oh he goooood
<WallDives> ah...
<Maid_Ponies47> Gets back to work being a maid
<Kosoveon> I was speaking with regards to the nature of how you express your opinions.
<Shane377> Maid_Ponies47: u still have a 50 cal bullet in ur hoof
<Shizuka> 13i'm not sure if l4d2 is too much more taxing on hardware
*Biglaw|Maid makes a mess
*pikoBarber shaves GilDash|Maid... Below the belt.
<Aurora> 6I'm going to make an assumption
<OmegaMetroidBarber> O_O
<Aurora> 6eXAKR i don't think has ever once forgiven you for what happened last year.
<Shane377> Barber time^^
<MaidWarrior> I wonder if equestria knows about bronystate
<twilight_sprinkler> stupid english class, i hate you
<Aurora> 6just saying that's one reason why this is so ugly
<Biglaw|Maid> Stop, Barber time
<drfsupercenter> 03and I don't even remember what happened last year

<Shadow_Lugia> 6I'm like a bunch of the people that've left or just stay on TST because of the friends they had.
<pikoBarber> That's actually a pretty technical term GilDash|Maid... Your knowledge of animal anatomy scares me...
<GilDash|Maid> Champion_of_Harmony: 'Cause I'm awesome. :)
<CupcakeWarrior> CCCPMAID: Maid hour is over in three minutes

<Ascendant> Drake and I were lol'ing in PM
<Kosoveon> why try to remember good old days when you can create new ones?
<Kosoveon> at least
<GilDash|Maid> CCCP: ... Aw, no fun. :D

<Shadow_Lugia> 6Nah.

<cachi01> http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5763695
<Ascendant> I suppose I'll go talk to eXAKR again tonight, because it's getting very annoying
<Ascendant> But drf, you really shouldn't react either
<pikoBarber> Alright, GilDash|Maid, no need to take it fast. I like it slow.
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think TST was ever super-happy nobody arguing with anyone, I've been on the IRC from the start and there were always a share of conflicts with various people
<Shane377> Ponies47: calm ur palm
<Ascendant> Because that's what he wants
<GilDash|Maid> Biglaw|Maid: What?
<drfsupercenter> 03so I'm curious what you mean by good old days
<Ascendant> lol of course
<Biglaw|Maid> GilDash|Maid nuttin'
<Kosoveon> as in, instead of reminiscing strive to create new "good times," so to speak
<Kosoveon> @Ascendant
<Champion_of_Harmony> GilDash|Maid: lit?
<Ascendant> I know Kosoveon
<Kosoveon> oh
<Shadow_Lugia> 6When the chat wasn't half DRF.
<Ponies47> Biglaw|Maid: Did you read all the crap Shane377 did to me!?!
<SheenaFox> lol
<Kosoveon> I read that as "what, Kosoveon"
<Kosoveon> o.o
<Shane377> Ponies47: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3529/
<Kosoveon> my bad LOL
<Ascendant> At least drf keeps it alive, Quanyails
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Or maybe he stifles it. :/
<Litwick> http://notalwaysright.com/dovahkiins-day-off/19832 BEST CUSTOMER EVER.
<drfsupercenter> 03That's the thing
<Ascendant> The chat is dead most of the time without him, tbh
<GilDash|Maid> Champion_of_Harmony: Oh, I mean literally what I said before. :D
<VioletGreySha> hay Shane377
<Ascendant> Oh?
<drfsupercenter> 03I wouldn't appear to be talking to myself if people actually said stuff.
<Ponies47> Shane377; and?
<Ascendant> How about he keeps quiet for a WEEK and we'll see whether it's still being "stifled"?
<SheenaFox> It can go either way really
<cachi01> Shane377: DOOOOOOOOOOMEEEEEEEEEE
<SheenaFox> wb Ecco
<drfsupercenter> 03LMAO Ascendant
<Ascendant> wb
<Shadow_Lugia> 6That would be nice, NS. :P
<Kyubree> 07lol
<Shane377> hey VioletGreySha * hugs VioletGreySha *
<drfsupercenter> 03I almost want to take you up on that
<GilDash|Maid> Champion_of_Harmony: Type in "(tunes)" withough quotations, then a space, then your message as normal. :)
<VioletGreySha> :D
<drfsupercenter> 03can I buy some tumbleweed first though
<EccoCode> ty Sheen and Ascendant
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Why can't I hold all these links?
<Shane377> Ponies47: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4761/
<Kyubree> 07well it's usually either tech talk or an argument
<Chimera> O_O
<Chimera> SL
<Chimera> OMG
<Chimera> I just realized
<Champion_of_Harmony> GilDash|Maid: thank you
<Kosoveon> where does one by tumbleweed, anyway?
<Shane377> Scoot-Scootaloo: cause ur only a filly?
<drfsupercenter> 03ebay
<Chimera> the music playing when he's vsing the ninjas
<drfsupercenter> 03where else
<EccoCode> Sheena* (woops, ^^; )
*GilDash|Maid licks pikoBarber on the chin.
<Aurora> 6kyu summarized what I was about to say ina full line
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Yep.
<Chimera> is a metal remix
<SheenaFox> I like how Kyu said that
<Ascendant> Kyubree, and when it's not, it's more often than not quiet
<SheenaFox> Very
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Team Plasma music.
<Kyubree> 07and seeing the conversation
<SheenaFox> nice.
<Chimera> of Vs Plasma
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: I won't be here long... ;)
<Chimera> I'm GRINNING
<Chimera> <3
<Kyubree> 07we could do without the argument half
<Ascendant> And seeing the conversation puts people off?
<Ponies47> *Hugs Shane377* I'm sorry I chucked you into the trash :(
<Ascendant> Yes, that's true
<Shadow_Lugia> 6I was interested in that.
<Ascendant> but
<Shadow_Lugia> 6The rest of the music was kinda blah.
<Aurora> 6ok well
<drfsupercenter> 03when I'm NOT here, it's usually either gen 5 talk or silence
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03or art
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Because guitars, guitars, everywhere.
<drfsupercenter> 03art too
<Ascendant> half the time no one would talk anyway
<Ascendant> well drf, that's not a bad thing
<Ascendant> but
<pikoBarber> Oh noe GilDash|Maid... Then I guess we should speed it up! Hurry! Lick my chin faster!
<Ascendant> the fact remains that drf is a part of the community and has all rights to talk
*Shane377 hesitatly hugs Ponies47 back
<Aurora> 6probably because when you're gone we actually CAN talk about 5th gen
<Ascendant> As does everyone else
<Aurora> 6but that aside
<drfsupercenter> 03well Aurora
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: ... I think we'll have to go further than that. ;)
*VioletGreySha hugs Shane377 back
<CCCP> word of the day: BENSON
<Kandarihu|H8s2Clean> Litwick: thanks for the excellent link.
<Chimera> SL
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean like how when Skylands and I were having a perfectly good conversation about how gen5 sucks and you butted in with something when we didn't ask you to?
<Aurora> 6no, no wells, because most of the time you DO comment into a 5th gen conversation
<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah, same idea there.
<Chimera> Guitars aren't bad
<Aurora> 6when you very well don't have to
<Chimera> too much feels like clutter
<Litwick> That ping honest to god made me scream.
<Chimera> especially when out of place
<pikoBarber> Lick my... Upper lip, GilDash|Maid?
<Chimera> anyway
*Shane377 lifts VioletGreySha into the air like the swan hold dance move thingo
<Biglaw|Maid> Sigh, Maid hour is over
<WallDives> ...
<Shadow_Lugia> 6No one else was interrupting that conversation you had, DRF?
<Litwick> I was clicknig through tumblr when..... PING!
<Chimera> imagine if Pokémon was actually live action like that
<Aurora> 6I don't do that ona regular basis unless you do something like "be a pro and don't use 5th gen" etc
<Chimera> well I mean
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Live-action?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :D
<Biglaw> Derp! I'm not a maid
<Chimera> the fights
<Biglaw> :p
<VioletGreySha> Shane377: ö_ö what you doin? :3
<Aurora> 6the fact I did it I still don't remember what was going on
<drfsupercenter> 03I know, but you did in that case and we weren't even talking to you
<CCCP> i swear my parents know i love mlp
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ah, real-time?
<Chimera> yeah
<Aurora> 6I wouldn't do that know so I'm upset at myself for saying it
<Chimera> real time I mean
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: Oh, sod that.
<CCCP> but they dont tell me
<Ponies47> Shane377: Okie doki loki. Aren"t you gonna say sorry for all of the stuff you did to me?
<Chimera> a legit real-time Pokémon game
<Aurora> 6*now
<cachi01> my mom knows, she laughs at me
<Chimera> I so want one
*GilDash|Maid kisses pikoBarber suddenly.
<Shane377> VioletGreySha: just sharing the love
<drfsupercenter> 03<Chimera> I so want one <- I think we all do
<Kosoveon> same Chimera
<drfsupercenter> 03that's something we agree on
*pikoBarber kisses GilDash|Maid back.
<Aurora> 6although one time vs 100 times
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Hmm, well, I'm divided on that idea.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Mine know I love it but um... it kinda makes me feel like less of a man around my dad though....
<Shane377> Ponies47: i gave u a hug wut else do u want?
<Kosoveon> although, PokePark is the closest to that right now lol
<Deleted_Dreams> Hello?
<Kyubree> 07funny that you remember that one time, but can you count all the other times you throw insults into other conve...
<Aurora> 6I don't see why I'm the bad guy
<Kyubree> 07late
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Hey thar Deleted_Dreams
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Because pokemon is more puzzle-based than action-based.
<WallDives> hi Deleted_Dreams.
<Aurora> 6I only attack when attacked, so to say
<drfsupercenter> 03insults and saying I don't like something are two different things o_O
<Chimera> SL
<Ascendant> 'sblood, next time we'll just split the channel in #5thgenhaters and #5thgenlovers and then a #5thgenidiots channel too, just so we can all mind our own business
<Chimera> didn't stop them from making pinbll
<Chimera> pinball
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Ascendant
<CCCP> hello eeeeee3432
<Shadow_Lugia> 6True.
<Chimera> yes it was a spinoff
<Aurora> 6the hell?
<Dark_Horst> hey guys... look what i have here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JppPNPwFz_U
<Aurora> 6why should a channel
<Ponies47> Shane377: A hug is good. How about saying sorry for all the stuff you did?
<drfsupercenter> 03#5thgenidiots LMAO
<Aurora> 6A POKEMON SITE
<Aurora> 6be split
<Aurora> 6into separate channels
<Aurora> 6for that
<drfsupercenter> 03I think she was kidding
<CCCP> ohai Googlie_apartus45
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Art thou a new pony to Bronystate, the Herd, or both?
<Ascendant> note the bloody sarcasm
<VioletGreySha> Shane377: a hug will do the same effect :D
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: Lie down. ;)
<Aurora> 6Ascendant you're timing plus personality makes it hard
<drfsupercenter> 03Ascendant have I mentioned how awesome I think you are for having the same dry sense of humor that I do :P
<Aurora> 6so please forgive me and my rather sour mood -_-
<Shane377> seee Ponies47 u hear wut VioletGreySha just said
<Kyubree> 07see
<Chimera> I agree with roara :p

<Chimera> :v
<WallDives> grrr....

<SheenaFox> Hmmmm sarcasm doesn't need to be in a debate

<Shadow_Lugia> 6Night!
<Ascendant> Do you know JUST how main offenses he's had?
<Ponies47> Shane377; True. Well Twilight took away all the scars I had with magic. But now I got much better wings thanks to Princess Luna. But now I shall keep my orginal ones incase I ever want them put back on. :)
<Aurora> 6kyu actually I'm on drf and Ascendant's side here
<SheenaFox> hi Shiny
<Kyubree> 07and DRF, just don't give him the reaction
<WallDives> Shane377: hahano.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey Sheena
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: I don't think it'll matter because you'll be too busy performing for me to pay them mind. ;)
<Aurora> 6eXAKR's been doing this for literally a year..
<Ascendant> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03well, if he has me on ignore, I still fail to see what the problem is o_O
<cachi01> Shane377: oh god WTF XD
<Aurora> 6he started after he came back when we returned from our "leave"
<Shane377> haha WallDives
<Ascendant> I've already warned him twice or three times, Kyu
<Shane377> LOL cachi01
<drfsupercenter> 03because he won't see my reply
<Aurora> 6and he makes a point of doing this to drf
<Ascendant> As in, PM warning
<Dark_Horst> godammit shane, MY EARS!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Dark_Horst thus is the reason I hate sleep. Hours of just lying there breathing...
<WallDives> All I saw was the title. All I needed to see was the title.
<Ascendant> Yes, what Aurora said
<Shane377> cachi01: WallDives http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwRbOm2Pvg

<pikoBarber> Well okay, GilDash|Maid... Whatever you want. But I'm going to need more shaving cream after this...
<Kyubree> 07but at the very least, I know he's just not going to listen to either of you specifically
<Ascendant> He listens to me most of the time
<Aurora> 6i warned him plenty of times too
*CupcakeWarrior engages lurk mode
<twilight_sprinkler> trixie goes so perfect with the rhythm
<Aurora> 6and I'm actually friends with him
<drfsupercenter> 03like I said, there's a reason I just sent hte logs to Ascendant instead of kicking/banning him on teh spot, that way it doesn't make it seem like I"m getting butthurt over it
<GilDash|Maid> pikoBarber: Where we're going, we won't need shaving cream... ;)
<Shane377> lol Dark_Horst
<drfsupercenter> 03as honestly, I can take just about anything, I just shouldn't *have* to.

*LunaSlurry hides CCCP, ungags him "RUN!"
<WallDives> Ponies47: probably all of it.
<drfsupercenter> 03I asked my friend to find me SACDs
*LunaSlurry goes back to lurking
<Airpuff> Bleh all these heroes T.T
<Ponies47> GilDash We need to go and save CCCP
<drfsupercenter> 03but I prefer to unlock the full potential of whatever systems I have
*CupcakeWarrior noms LunaSlurry
<drfsupercenter> 03DSes without flash carts, are super limited
*CCCP runs
<junh1024-XD> did you install inux yet?

<drfsupercenter> 03haven't tried
*LunaSlurry ish nommed
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02And when a movie comes out he buys it on blue-ray
*CCCP goes into sugarcube corner
<CupcakeWarrior> dat Meanwhile
*GilDash teleports CCCP to him.
*GilDash gags CCCP before he racts.
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02He wants that new Resident Evil game
<Meanwhile> It would appear that there are zombies everywhere.
*GilDash * reacts
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02And is actually willing to buy a PS3 just to play it
<Meanwhile> Allo everypony.

<CCCP> im
<Litwick> Mine Turtle!
<Kyubree> 07I'd trade in the 7 if you're able, then sell the DSi to amazon for credit there
<Kosoveon> I've had enough of Chris Redfield tbh, though it's nice to see Leon back in action

<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02Wii
<Meanwhile> LunaSlurry: I went to play SupCom2. I literally spent the time up 'till now on one game because my ai team mates keep squandering their forces and the enemy ai does too. :I
<Kyubree> 07compare against amazon and come up with a total first
<Kosoveon> PS2, PSP, Wii
<Aurora> 6koso, don't hold your breath
<Ponies47> Drops non CCCP
<Kosoveon> @drf
<drfsupercenter> 03I was talking to Shiny :P
<Kosoveon> it's possible
<drfsupercenter> 03since she wanted games
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03Wii is easy to hack
<Kosoveon> at the very least
<Meanwhile> It's an endless stream of me sending my troops off to die.
<Kosoveon> Monster Hunter 4
<Aurora> 6looks like there's going to be no MH3G announcement at E3
<Kosoveon> will have some kind of formal reveal
<Aurora> 6no MH announcement at all
<drfsupercenter> 03I could easily download the games for you
<Ponies47> I fly back to go save the real CCCP!
<LunaSlurry> Ah....
<Meanwhile> Eventually though, EVENTUALLY, I'll break them.
*Airpuff teleports to CCP and Ponies47 then grabbing them with magic defenestrating them into another tub of jelly.
<CupcakeWarrior> Shizuka is best zombie
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02Unless they go SURPRISE on us.
<CCCP> what are you doing to me??
<Airpuff> xD
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02I actually need to look to see what Wii games there are, I believe there's only one or two
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02And I have one
<Kosoveon> which, again, is possible :3
<Ponies47> Flys out of jelly bucks Airpuff in the nose. Grabs CCCP and we fly away
*GilDash retrieves CCCP and Ponies47. He cleans them up.
<Meanwhile> Dat hunter lag.
<Kosoveon> suprises happen.

<Aurora> 6hmm, gamestop is open til 9pm
<Airpuff> Bah.

<CCCP> D:

<Kosoveon> or pigs that fly
<pikorar> Bye bye RainBroDash!
<panda> RainBroDash: :D alright
*Airpuff teleports to the top of GilDash now being a chibi and holds onto horn.
<Kosoveon> and what have you
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02It must be nice to walk to places /countrygal

<Shizuka> 13beyond words
<Kyubree> 07just

<Meanwhile> Sometimes the director just spits on you.
<Kosoveon> pokemon conquest is interesting
<Aurora> 6 30 minute drive to the nearest decent shopping area
<GilDash> Ponies47: I can think of something. ;)
*pikorar coughs like crazy.
<Aurora> 6other than target
<Shane377> i just heard Derpy Hooves daughter is Dinky? <-- is that true ?
<Ponies47> Takes pikorar to the hosiptial
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Anything going on in here?
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02That's about the same for me :'D
*pikorar continues coughing.
<Kosoveon> the artwork is lovely, and the idea of conquering kingdoms is cool
<Meanwhile> What you need to do is access the console
<CupcakeWarrior> http://notalwaysright.com/a-moooo-sing-customers/11471
<Meanwhile> And spawn 4 tanks :3
<Ponies47> GilDash: what?
<Aurora> 6went from small country town to LA
*Airpuff stares at CCCP from the top of GilDash 's head.
<Meanwhile> Of course, that'd need the server password.
<Aurora> 6what a culture shock
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02Ouch
<Kyubree> 07hurr
<Kosoveon> I'd have to wait for the initial reviews before I make a decision about buying it though
<superretroworld> Derpy_Hooves: so are you related to doctor hooves?
<cachi01> im back
<Aurora> 6it was fun lol
*pikorar coughs so much he bends light with the water vapor escaping his lungs and coughs out rainbows.
<Kyubree> 07I thought it /wasn't/ LA
*Kyubree runs
<Meanwhile> Who doesn't know how to crouch?
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02I don't know if I'd get it lol I have no money
<RX-78-SweetieBot> LunaSlurry? does that mean theres a SlurryLuna right now too?
<cachi01> its easy just press r3
*Airpuff Gives pikorar the title of magician.
*CCCP turns into an owl and BAM!
<Ponies47> Flys faster to get pikorar to the hosiptal
<cachi01> lol
<Aurora> 6see
*GilDash kisses Ponies47.

*drfsupercenter runs
<Shane377> is dink derpys daugher ?
<Aurora> 6whenever I say LAthough, people are like "no dude, this isn't LA"
<Aurora> 6to me, it's LA
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02No :c
<Meanwhile> Shane377: Fanon says yes.
<Kyubree> 07|D
*pikorar thanks Airpuff for his newfound magical powers in between coughing fits.
<cachi01> pikorar: rainbotuberculosis?

<GilDash> Ponies47: You wanted to know. :D
<Kosoveon> as you progress
<drfsupercenter> 03and problem solved
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<panda> otakon, wow, he is so RAAAAGE XD
<Kyubree> 07that's why I always lump the entire south bay together and call it San Jose
<Kyubree> 07:3c
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02I don't even have that kind of money OTL
<GilDash> CCCP: What about you?
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02And yes it does :O
<Kosoveon> because I only played for the first few hours and I didn't see much to it
<Ponies47> GilDash: :D
<Aurora> 6kyu exactly
<CCCP> otakon otakon otakon
*Airpuff still stands atop of Gildash 's head leaning towards the horn
<Kosoveon> dangit
<CCCP> GilDash: wuut?
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02It's not a really deep story, but it does have one.

<Kosoveon> off to youtube, then

<Aurora> 6the rest of it is san jose
<Meanwhile> otakon does not adapt well to pc gaming.
<pikorar> But for reals, I'm coughing like crazies and it doesn't feel good... My chest is burning.

*Airpuff teleports out of the tub before i hit the jelly.

<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02What drf said
<pikorar> I have some sort of cold, panda. It's really agressive and I'm getting terrible coughing fits. The problem is my temperature is normal, my oxygen levels are at 100% and the doctors insist that my lungs are clear... But I'm really sick.
<Saturn> 08,01i can't be fucked with this computational complexity crap
<Aurora> 6michigan is michigan to me too

<Ponies47> Shane377: He threw me into jelly!
*Shane377 throws Nigel Thornberry at Saturn
<Aurora> 6california is one of the few states that actually can be divided
<cachi01> now son dont touch that nigel
<Aurora> 6unlike you guys lol
*Saturn 08,01explodes, then explodes agai
<Kyubree> 07michigan is just "lame half of the US" to me
<Kosoveon> inb4 montana
*Kyubree flees
<Sally> hai
*Airpuff creates a protective barrier of magic which expands and pushes Ponies47 back and shattering the jelly cauldron.
<Aurora> 6montana is montana
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02Uh huh we're divided!
<Aurora> 6no one lives there lol
<Shane377> Ponies47: that dats not a reason to act violently
<Kosoveon> well if you divided it in half
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02"You guys in the north" and "You guys in the south"
<Kosoveon> you'd have two sizable cities
<Biglaw> Alright everypony I'll be playing MineCraft! See y'all soon!

<Kosoveon> COLORADO
<Kosoveon> IS SO PRETTY
<Kosoveon> <3
<panda> pikorar, honey and lemon. Why not just brew some hot tea with honey ^^
<cachi01> i hate when the doctor tells me to drink honey and lemon
<Aurora> 6that
<cachi01> IT TASTES HORRIBLE!
<Aurora> 6what drf posted
<Aurora> 6as horrible as that is
<Ponies47> Walks up to Airpuff looks at him with a I'm going to kill you face but then smiles. I'm sorry Airpuff :(
*GilDash sneaks up behind CCCP and places hooves before eyes.
<Aurora> 6I laughed really hard
<Aurora> 6I feel awful
<Ran> 2^
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02Realization face
<CCCP> :(
<superretroworld> dont they usually give you jello at hospitals?
<CCCP> :)
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<GilDash> CCCP: Guess who?
<CCCP> GilDash: you?
<pikorar> panda... I've never liked tea to be honest... But what the doctor said is that I can't take any liquids with the honey or else it'll go down too quickly to actually cover up the nerve endings that are making me cough... That's how he said it.
*GilDash noms on CCCP's ear.
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02So Ran
<Shiny-Slowpoke> 02May I PM?
<Saturn> 08,01anyone getting anything on stream?
<GilDash> CCCP: Mmm... how did you know?
<Meanwhile> Nah stream went down.
<Ran> 2Of course
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Saturn
<panda> pikorar, ah I see, you need it to coat your throat
<Kyubree> 07lol
<drfsupercenter> 03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/funny-facebook-fails-too-many-fails-to-list.jpg
<Kimori> whats up?
<GilDash> pikorar: What he's pescribed you is for a freaking cough.
*Airpuff returns to normal size before poking Ponies47
<CCCP> GilDash: my pinkie sense tells me (or what ever its called)
<pikorar> Yeah, panda... I just don't see how it'll help...
*GilDash kisses CCCP.
<Meanwhile> Shizu was streaming L4D2 but comcast took a nosedive and understandably it's staying that way.
<GilDash> CCCP: What does it tell you about that? ;)
<panda> pikorar: well, it will ease the coughing im sure
<Glacymr> hiii
<Shane377> Dinky is cutest filly
<CriticKitten> There. Beat Portal 2 single. Lesse.... >_>
<CCCP> GilDash: :o
<Ponies47> Pokes Airpuff back with tears in eyes. Hugs Airpuff
<Shane377> Ponies47: use /me
<WallDives> 4-0 in sfxt, 0-3 in skullgirls. I guess I can take that as a win?
<superretroworld> GilDash: ......well you suddenly got creepy
<CriticKitten> And the time is....6.1 hours. Not bad.
<otakon> and it crashed
<WallDives> and GilDash is still being GilDash.
*Airpuff blushes before smiling forgiving back
<pikorar> Well GilDash, he said that the infection should go away on its own. I've been taking an antibiotic for the last 6 months and he said that it ironically kills the exact kind of virus that I'm infected with. He just said that it'll take some time...
<Shane377> Derpy x Carrot top?
<Glacymr> so Kyubree
<Ascendant> bbl
<drfsupercenter> 03http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/funny-facebook-fails-no-escape.jpg <- OK, that one is actually really clever
<GilDash> pikorar: ... Antibiotics have no effect on viruses. >_<
<drfsupercenter> 03as much as... how do you steal a copy of Office?
<Shane377> lol nvm
<Ponies47> Hugs Airpuff and says sorry. :(
<Glacymr> are you a new form of Kyurem where instead of fusing with Reshiram or Zekrom, you fuse with an Umbreon?
<Shizuka> 13comcasts constant screwups are making me cry... not even sure if i'll be able to encore rocky...
<GilDash> superretroworld: Suddenly? Lol, what? :D
<otakon> yeah, my game crashed
<pikorar> GilDash: Sorry, I use the word virus for everything. He just said that it'll kill the infection.
<Shane377> Shizuka: sad face
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Don't cry. ;_;
<Airpuff> pikorar .... antibiotics are just against bacteria... xD
<otakon> ARGH!
<superretroworld> GilDash: you said 'kisses cccr'
<junh1024-XD> boxed copy?
<otakon> STUPID UPDATE, WHY NOW!?
<Meanwhile> otakon x da freakin room.
<cachi01> dont cry shizu SMILE :D
<GilDash> pikorar: But it probably *is* that kind of virus. WHich means it'll have no effect. >_<
<Meanwhile> Seriously otakon you take to the pc like a fish takes to the desert.
<panda> otakon, you rage so much ^^
<Ponies47> Ok Airpuff now what's going on with CCCP?
<cachi01> we need a pinkie smiling emoticon
*Airpuff laughs at Ponies47
<GilDash> Meanwhile: I'm the one trying to work the room up...
<otakon> Is the stream even up?
<panda> pikorar, oh and you know that honey has meany positive medicial effects?
<Meanwhile> otakon: eenope.
<otakon> oh just wondering
<Ponies47> Airpuff: Like a evil laugh?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3nittany_discord, otakon, you coming back in?
<CCCP> Ponies47: idk
<pikorar> GilDash: What I"m saying is that he didn't actually use the word virus... He used the word infection. Actually he even told me that it won't kill viruses. I just wasn't paying close attention to what i was typing. -.-
<otakon> kirzstryfe: I'll pass for now, I need to play it about 6 years to get to novice level
<Shane377> kirzstryfe: u not streaming lfd?
<Airpuff> Ponies47: nope. Just a glad laugh.
*Airpuff teleports to CCCP and hugs
<Ponies47> Airpuff: I begin to laugh to and we brohoof /)
*Shane377 introduces dinky to panda
<drfsupercenter> 03true
*CCCP nuzzles Airpuff
<MahBoi777> cachi01: like this? http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/091/3/1/pinkie_pie_smile_by_lolke12-d4rkwpa.png

<panda> Shane377: who is dinky?
<Meanwhile> kirzstryfe: Coooomiiiing.
*Airpuff blushes before walking away slowly smiling
<GilDash> pikorar: It sounds like cold/flu type infection. Which means virus. Which means antibiotics will have no affect. Ordinarily I wouldn't question a doctor, but he gave you HONEY AND LEMON. THAT'S FOR COUGHS AND SORE THROATS! >_<
<cachi01> MahBoi777: XD dem eyes lol
<panda> kirzstryfe: uh... um... can I pm you a question?

<BlueFlare> 02and you did get real earthquakes there
<StewedLeeks> lol big place?
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently I had to delete the built in save data or something
<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: i snagged nothing :(
<drfsupercenter> 03when it "installs game data"
<MahBoi777> haha

<Shane377> did u get a smaller one DeathStar or ?
<DeathStar> Shane377: no a mc donalds one
<Reikim> I never went to grab a pony toy...too embarrassed to walk into McD's and demand ponies.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://imageshack.us/f/208/img6399w.jpg/
<Shane377> DeathStar: how big is it lin me a pic
<CupcakeWarrior> I only got an applejack from mcdonalds
<BlueFlare> 02my parents are from CA and they said they felt them all the time
<cachi01> smaller ones are better than the gian head mod installed pony toys
<Aurora> 6they're common
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany_Discord: dat bottle of beer
<ponies47> I love this! http://kyrospawn.deviantart.com/art/MLP-FIM-Soundboard-V8-3-244757196
<Reikim> So basically this anime fails chess.
<Aurora> 6I haven't had as many down here thugh, back home we had them a lot
<Aurora> 6I love them
<Chrysalis> is it bad i see that box art i think thats not turtle thats tank
<Shane377> i want one like Nittany_Discord has
<DeathStar> Shane377: heres a pic (it's pretty small) http://i50.tinypic.com/6xrfw9.jpg
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: I'm so jelly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That is not beer.
<twilight_sprinkler> DeathStar: i want! >:
<Shane377> DeathStar: is that ur hand?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's actually an energy drink.
<BlueFlare> 02it would be neat to be in one :P
<cachi01> DeathStar: yeah thats a good toy
<mario_pony> DeathStar: i can see your reflection
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And the name is pretty fun.
<cachi01> the ones i dont like
<Shane377> DeathStar: if thats ur hand u should be a hand model
<MahBoi777> what's it called?
<cachi01> are the giant heads ones
<Reikim> In chess, if you are moving your king unnecessarily, YOU ARE FAILING.
<Chrysalis> quick, everyone look around at the room rather than the pony
<DeathStar> Shane377: umm thanks
<cachi01> xDD
<Aurora> 6not if you're not used to them
<Chrysalis> Reikim depends on your tactic
<Shane377> XD---- DeathStar
<Aurora> 6we had familiy from indiana come out
<Reikim> Chrysalis: No.
<Aurora> 6we actually had a fairly large earthquake one of the nights they were here
<Shane377> DeathStar: did u get it with a happy meal and did u get to choose between the toy or did u just get a a mlp toy and would it happen in asu too?
<BlueFlare> 02then it would be scary, which I would like XD
<Reikim> Chrysalis: Moving the king first is bad. Always.
<Aurora> 6me, my mom, and my grandma were like "yeah this is cool"
<Shane377> aus*
<Litwick> to protect the world from devesta- wait wrong anime.
<Vinco> For great justice
<Chrysalis> Reikim yes, iv won games through breakin strategy
<twilight_sprinkler> Reikim: he didnt move the king first
<Aurora> 6the rest of them were literally diving under the table
<Chrysalis> also, you can't move the king first
<twilight_sprinkler> Reikim: the game was already in progress
<Reikim> Chrysalis: There are very, very few exceptions.
<CupcakeWarrior> T S Parking?
<twilight_sprinkler> Chrysalis: the game was already in progress
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkler: Good point, actually.
<twilight_sprinkler> he was only a substitution
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkler: If he wasn't in check, though, he shouldn't have. More than enough pieces to move something else.
<mario_pony> oh no mom's almost home :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01S1 of Code Geass?
<mario_pony> i'll have to go to bed soon
<twilight_sprinkler> Reikim: well we cant really know the situation unless we go back and look
<CupcakeWarrior> mario_pony: Quick hide your porn!

<Reikim> twilight_sprinkler: This is now what I will do.
<BlueFlare> 02lmao

<Aurora> 6only the major earthquakes do that
<BlueFlare> 02thought so
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's a service to help me find work.
<mario_pony> i'll probably sneak out of bed when she falls asleep
<DeathStar> Shane377: that seems like it would involve effort maybe you should check the mc donalds website
<ponies47> I wish I had some pony stuff. But I'm to much of a scootaloo for that. :(
<twilight_sprinkler> i like how the people are portrayed
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Ah, okay then.
<mario_pony> or maybe she'll go out and i can stay up late
<Shane377> DeathStar: plzzzz
<Reikim> twilight_sprinkler: They're like real people.

<Reikim> Shane337: This series excels at blurring the line.
<Shane377> mario_pony: the dentist is so good
<twilight_sprinkler> Shane377: generally britannians are bad, but there are many exceptions
*Nittany_Discord 11,01stays up.
<MahBoi777> denntists are evil

<Reikim> pony_911: Death I mean cake!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can't afford to go to the dentist right now.

<twilight_sprinkler> Shane377: other countries arent really bad or good

<Shane377> twilight_sprinkler: lol that helps
<MahBoi777> Shane377: ur gonna scare the boi
<twilight_sprinkler> Shane377: well yeah its nt that simple

<CupcakeWarrior> The dentist sucks, unless its Colgate
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Was that about a dentist going nuts?
*MahBoi777 hugs Tarku back
<pony_911> actually .....i feel very comfortable and relax when i go to the dentist
<Shane377> mario_pony: the saw they use to cut ur teeth wen u get a filling
<Reikim> ponies47: You could always try a convention.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I remember seeing a movie where a dentist goes nuts.
<Vinco> I'm years overdue for a dentist appointment
<Shane377> mario_pony: it sounds like a chainsaw on ur teeth
<mario_pony> Shane377: o_o
*CupcakeWarrior gives Nittany_Discord nuts
<Reikim> ponies47: You have to go the first day, though, because pony merch at a con will almost always sell out in under 24 hours.
<soulrider96> SPINZAKU

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Luna is a good person, and ruining her stream with my cynicism was bad.
<CupcakeWarrior> 0//0
<CriticKitten> Why if only the game had some sort of MODE that could allow its users to play the game OFFLINE....
<CriticKitten> BUT THAT'S JUST SILLY LOL.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's why I'm not excited about new games anymore.
<Cat> what, conversation is happening here
<Cat> weird
<ponies47> Reikim: True. Well anthor problem is my patrents still don't know I'm a brony. :( To scared to tell them. Wow I'm really like Fluttershy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So much bullshit that shouldn't be there.
<Reikim> CupcakeWarrior: Hot anime girl with special powers. Seems pretty standard.
<Chrysalis> CriticKitten oh hello there DRM, arnt you supposed to stop pirates and give a better experience to paying customers, oh whats that you got your targets all mixed up?
<ponies47> *Parents
<MahBoi777> I'm only lookin forward to 1 game this year, it was previously 2 :/
<CriticKitten> Oh I knew it would happen. I'm glad it did really, helped prove the point that the game isn't the quality it should be.
<mario_pony> ponies47: tell them right now
*CupcakeWarrior doesnt play popular games
<Reikim> ponies47: They'll find out eventually. Don't worry 'bout pushing it.

<Reikim> Chrysalis: Not all of them do.
<cachi01> most of them dude
<Chrysalis> show me one shooter without autoaim
<cachi01> or a shooter that doesnt tell you
<Reikim> Chrysalis: What's auto-aim?

<Cat> I has hot chocolate :3
<Reikim> Chrysalis: I wouldn't know, I haven't played anything except TF2...which doesn't even have a manual.
<MahBoi777> I hate auto-aim
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is a gamer, but a very cynical one that HATES the modern gaming industry, so he'll get in a rant about why the industry is bad in 10 seconds flat if he doesn't watch out. He just misses the days before games were ruined by publishers.
<Chrysalis> shooters on consoles pull your crosshairs TOWARDS your enemies when you shoot
<StewedLeeks> lolz nice
<pony_911> gotta go !!!!!!!! piano practicing time !!!!
<Chrysalis> they actively help you shoot better
<ponies47> mario_pony: Or they'll just find out
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs CriticKitten
<cachi01> Chrysalis: if not the enemies will get infront of you
<Reikim> Chrysalis: Metroid Prime 3. But that's not really a true shooter.
<CupcakeWarrior> CriticKitten is best kitten

<Reikim> Saturn: ...You'll have to explain that to us.
*Soupjuice has no idea what saturn is talking about
<Kencolt> I have dealt with the pronlem of pony opinions by the simple and elegant usage of the fact that I'm 54 years old, known to be slightly crazy, and not giving a buck what anyone else thinks. It' surprisingly effective.
<MahBoi777> mario_pony
<Om|reading> twilight_sprinkler: Yes I have.
<DeathStar> Saturn: YAY!
<Petrified_Discord> MahBoi777:

<Saturn> 08,01Reikim: the master theorem in computational complexity is a way of doing complexity analysis on recursive divide and conquer algorithms
<Reikim> CupcakeWarrior: You load the drive into the program as a virtual drive, then you browse through to find your game.
<CupcakeWarrior> Virtual drive?
<Reikim> Saturn...you lost me. But that's okay.
*Sylandest mind blown by Saturn
<ponies47> mushroom: I ponified my computer once. I had desktopPonies and a pony desktop picture. But then got worried and took the DesktopPonies off and put the picture I had before back. I still have DesktopPonies in my files but I'm to scared to tell my parents.

<Cat> but it sure felt cold
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: no shampoo?! what sorcery is this??
<Reikim> CupcakeWarrior: It's like...the emulator treats it like a drive, if you were running MS-DOS
<Petrified_Discord> Kencolt: All of season 1, subbed and dubbed
<Chrysalis> Saturn there are easier ways of putting that...
<mario_pony> ponies47: well if i was you i would straight up tell them
<Kencolt> Not Saeson 2?

<MahBoi777> tuba is best instrument
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: it's a complicated way of finding out how fast an algorithm will run?
<Chrysalis> then again, its 0530 in the morning, big words keep us up
<Reikim> Now Saturn, that's how you explain things to a layman.
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: that sucks

<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03Tylenol is the only other thing I have
<drfsupercenter> 03and it doesn't work as well
<MahBoi777> Petrified_ASSHOLE: lmao
<drfsupercenter> 03since I can't take pills, Alleve or whatever it is is out of the question
<GabeofThrones> inb4 Time Warp
<Aurora> 6wait
<Aurora> 6what
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<Aurora> 6there's liquid advil?
<Shizuka> 13X3
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Aurora> 6liquid meds seem to cause more headaches than pills lol
<Aurora> 6just saying
<MahBoi777> hahaha
<Shizuka> 13see most of it is them all yelling random things
<drfsupercenter> 03it's called children's Advil but it's just as strong as the regular kind
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03I have no other option
<Shizuka> 13it's when they all get together for one line that it jumps a level of funny <3
<MahBoi777> huzzah for random shouting!
<Petrified_SLUT> It's actually funny when I can understand it :D
<sub06905> +
*Nittany_Discord 11,01pets Petrified_SLUT

<Shane377> XCD------
<hen3ry> She's not going to....
<CupcakeWarrior> I dont know about you guys, but this yelling is kind of ruining it for me :S
<WallDives> again, dat mute.
<drfsupercenter> 03ingest?
<drfsupercenter> 03you mean swallow?
<Aurora> 6take >.>
<drfsupercenter> 03and I Tried... almost choked on it
<MahBoi777> dammit janet
<Aurora> 6grind it up, put it on toast
<drfsupercenter> 03hmm
<Aurora> 6which is actually me being serious
<drfsupercenter> 03does that work though? I know some meds lose most of the effect if you chop them up
<Petrified_Discord> Dat motorcycle gang
<Aurora> 6thats how my parents got me to take sudafed when I was younger
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, I have my anti-depressants that I'm taking now, I just chew the pills
<drfsupercenter> 03even though they taste gross
<Aurora> 6I refused to take pills up until I was like 14
*Petrified_Discord goes off to acquire cake
<Aurora> 6quickly learned to take them without complaint when I had my wisdom teeth surgery
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not that I refuse to, I just can't... every time I try I end up spitting the thing out instinctually and gagging
<MahBoi777> mmmmmmm cake
<Aurora> 6no I know
<drfsupercenter> 03because I have a really strong gag reflex
<Aurora> 6I was the same way
<drfsupercenter> 03my orthodontist hated it
<Aurora> 6....well, I lack a gag reflex now
<drfsupercenter> 03he could hardly even put my braces in
<Aurora> 6but eh
<drfsupercenter> 03I almost puked all over the guy
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<CupcakeWarrior> If there were less people yelling, I could actually hear the words being yelled
<drfsupercenter> 03well I probably shouldn't find that funny, but it's the only way I keep from hating myself is to laugh at myself :|
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<Shizuka> 13that is true
<panda> Shizuka, when does the song about a transvestite from transylvania come up?
<Aurora> 6I rarely ever believe childrens meds are "just as powerful"
<drfsupercenter> 03point being I can't take pills. And liquid Advil has the same amount of ibuprofin as the pill form
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Shizuka> 13seeing it with a couple people that know it is good for your first time
<drfsupercenter> 03I also take like
<Aurora> 6because they're generally given much lower doses
<drfsupercenter> 034 doses of it
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Aurora> 6so unless you take more pills
<Aurora> 6yeh
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I'm saying
<drfsupercenter> 03but one dose has half a pill worth
<Aurora> 6which just flat out isn't healthy
<hen3ry> panda - soon
<drfsupercenter> 03and you usually take what, 2 Advil pills?
<SuperDismo64> AWWW :3 Dat shy Shizuka
<drfsupercenter> 03so I take like 4 doses
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Aurora> 6..
<drfsupercenter> 03It does work, just takes a while
<Aurora> 6 8 pills
<drfsupercenter> 03wait

<Shizuka> 13panda: soon
<Aurora> 6wait what

<Aurora> 6one does is only half a pill?
<CupcakeWarrior> So Im supposed to call Janet a slut?
<drfsupercenter> 03it just seems to make it worse off the bat
<drfsupercenter> 03uh

<Glacymr> i've had it overheat from terraria and minecraft before though
<Evil_Spike> Ah, Rocky Horror
<Glacymr> i'm just going to assume like drf once said
<Glacymr> that the video card is crappy
<Rain> my god.
<Rain> its prince-dari
<junh1024-XD> i could see graphics glitches such as green lines on the plage load throbber if i use firefox for hours.
<Shizikai> Dat kick
<Evil_Spike> I wish there were subtitles for the audience though
<Monfang> I already said that.
<DeadlyWeiss3> THAT was a cool effect :p

<junh1024-XD> these days its almost like a "required accesory" to have a cooling pad for your lap
<Glacymr> not really sure what to say because i've ran virtual machines on this laptop without ever overheating
<Evil_Spike> Trust me, this is so much fun at a midnight screening
<junh1024-XD> or a case for your ipod/itouch
<junh1024-XD> ae?
<Glacymr> i strongly think it's the graphics card
<drfsupercenter> 03oh nice
<drfsupercenter> 03I just got Katamari Forever installed as a XMB title-screen game

<SuperBrony64> 11,02^-^
<CECtheRonin> omg how are you getting the callback lines in here?
<panda> hiya DeathStar ^^
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs SuperBrony64
<Shane377> ive stolen VioletGreySha from u SuperBrony64
<Evil_Spike> Why am I lagging so badly?
<Shane377> cause ur Evil_Spike ?
<drfsupercenter> 03basically, you have to install it to MultiMAN, copy the files to a flash drive. Then use eBootFix to patch some stuff allowing you to launch it from the PS3 title screen instaed of needing the loader itself
<Evil_Spike> Of course
<hen3ry> its an effect of the earlier time warp
<panda> hen3ry: xD
<Evil_Spike> Throws deck of cards
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<Monfang> Who does things like this but his name starts with an 'R'?
<Shane377> panda: u kno how u look at her
<Monfang> Riffle?
<Shizuka> 13rifftrax
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02y u steal him? ;~;
<panda> Shane377, I do?
*DeathStar dances on SuperBrony64 s head
<Shane377> SuperBrony64: VioletGreySha is a girl
<Shizuka> 13which by the way this is all i have http://pastebin.com/kxnzu6v0
<Monfang> Doesn't rifftrax also do yelling versions of the MLP songs?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
*panda pokes DeathStar, "do I look at you wierd or something?"
<junh1024-XD> right so
<Shizuka> 13that's yaplap or something
<Evil_Spike> No, that's Yaplap
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's Yaplap.
<Monfang> Oh
*CupcakeWarrior gives SuperBrony64 an Allie Way
<DeathStar> panda: i dunno
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Sorlac does most of those.
<junh1024-XD> how do you install games from pirated ISOs from the web?
<drfsupercenter> 03copy them to a flash drive or hard drive
<Shizuka> 13hehehe they're singing the imperial march
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or Solrac.
<drfsupercenter> 03open MultiMAN
<WallDives> wonka with rifftrax?
<drfsupercenter> 03and copy to HDD
<Rain> dat trident
<drfsupercenter> 03(PS3 HDD)
<CupcakeWarrior> Its Val
<Shizuka> 13WallDives: the gene wilder one yes
<SuperBrony64> 11,02y u steal her? ;~;
<panda> you know, Yaplap should dub this whole movie ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03but you can also play them off flash/hard drive... however, less games work
<drfsupercenter> 03and slower speed
<WallDives> I need to see that.
*SuperBrony64 hugs the Allie Way
*Midnight_Tempest sneaks up behind DeathStar and glomps her.
<drfsupercenter> 03but you can run them through eBootFix before you copy them to MultiMAN to see if it makes a .pkg
<Shizuka> 13GOODBYE ALL OF THIS
<DeathStar> Midnight_Tempest: you so sneeky :)
<Shizuka> 13HELLOOOOOOO
<drfsupercenter> 03and if it does, that means you can launch it without needing the loader (once it's initially copied)
<drfsupercenter> 03confused yet?
*drfsupercenter runs
<Shizuka> 13HI OBLIVION! HOW'S THE WIFE AND KIDS
<SuperBrony64> 11,02HAI SHIZUKA :D/

<DeathStar> Midnight_Tempest: they cleaned the blood off they're very intelegent
<Eddmario> That guy with the white beard reminds me of Sean Connery in Last Crusade AND makes me hungry for fried chicken.
<Midnight_Tempest> DeathStar: indeed

<Spell-of-Gaming> ANOTHER RANDOM FACT: The creators of King Kong sued Donkey Kong for the name being familiar. Coincidentally, the one who saved Nintendo was where the creators of Kirby came up for his name.

*DeadpoolDash wonders if vegatarians ever make exceptions on eating certain types of meat?
<Vordox> DeadpoolDash: Some veggies eat Fish
<DeathStar> ^
<Vordox> Since it's not "Meat"
<Midnight_Tempest> fish is meat...
<Rain> ^
<Midnight_Tempest> anything from an animal is meat
<Spell-of-Gaming> Vordox: Those are called vegans, I think. :I
<DeadpoolDash> fish taco?
<Midnight_Tempest> Vegans are retarded in that respect
<Vordox> Some vegans/Veggies also eat egg.
<Rain> Spell-of-Gaming, Vegans dont eat /anything/ that comes from animals
<DeathStar> Spell-of-Gaming: nnope vegans don't eat fish or yogert or eggs ect
<Mutterguy_> no, Vegans won't any animal by product
<Mutterguy_> *eat
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh, sorry. :I
<Vordox> Malcom.. XD
<Mutterguy_> From what I know of afriend who does it for the healthy diet aspect, he'll eat meat only occassionally
<Midnight_Tempest> my common sense is tingling...
<DeadpoolDash> indeed
<DeathStar> ^
<Vordox> Mutterguy_: Meat isn't the reason you get fat
<Vordox> It's Coalhydrates
<Vordox> That's the "Fattening" molecules
<Vordox> Meat has almost NOTHING of it.
<Mutterguy_> I didn't say anything about getting fat
<DeathStar> it would be supper unheathy for me if I became a vegetarian
<Vordox> It's Coalhydrates that causes Heart stop...
<Spell-of-Gaming> For some reason, I think this dinosaur is cuter than the others :I
<DeadpoolDash> almost time for dino scat pron
<Vordox> I'm pretty CERTAIN that's a diet thing
<Spell-of-Gaming> Maybe I saw some anime about dinosaurs
<Mutterguy_> DeathStar, Cystic Fibrosis?
<DeathStar> Mutterguy_: nope
<Midnight_Tempest> i refuse to be a vegetarian... meat is needed in my diet
<DeathStar> Mutterguy_: I have mild lupis and it noms my iron levels
