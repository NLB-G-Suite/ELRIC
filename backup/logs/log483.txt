<kirzstryfe> 8,6hugging is fine, rape is not
<Drake> 04goddamnit more drama
<Bronysith> http://memegenerator.net/instance/21482073
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03and hugging is fine, to an extent
<Bronysith> Wrek|Dusty: would you rage if it was slow?
<Alicorn_Shane> Scoot-Scootaloo: how far can tickling go
<Om> When is rape ever fine -___--
<Airpuff> Im just talking against the ones who claims RP to be strictly forbidden.
<Aurora> 6drake that was more or less just the timing of your join
<Alchemist> so basically, nothing intimate.
<Bronysith> Wrek|Dusty: wait for it
<Vivix> When it's a faantaasyy
<Drake> 04ok then
<Obsidian> Wrek|Dusty: What is this soundtrack?
<Vivix> but this chat is also pg-13 during streams, right?
<GilDash> Om: Never. Rape is unacceptable.
<Om> GilDash: Exactly, it shouldn't even need to be said...
<Airpuff> Om: pretty much
<Bronysith> http://memegenerator.net/instance/21482122
<junh1024-XD> (・ω ・)
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Don't even mention Rape...
<kirzstryfe> 8,6light RP in itself is not forbidden. When someone takes the RP past just fun and into the creeper zone, it's an issue. When someone starts spamming /me or any other form of in-character RP, it's an issue
<Sumica> 00,10Oh hi all
<Shamroc> Bronysith: DUDE STOP
<Vivix> Only during saturday showings?
<Obsidian> Its PG13 ish
<prince-lemon> What most people class as RP is against the rules.

<Bronysith> Sumica: fallout or skyrim?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So if you are all like "/me puts x on a pedestal and worships", that is not allowed
<Alicorn_Shane> Bai :D Every:p one :d i haz school :"(
<Obsidian> What is this soundtrack anyway?
<Om> I agree. This soudntrack is Freaking FANTASTIC!
<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: okay
<Alchemist> What I find amazing is that in that short time I was here, there were very few trolls.
<Skylands> 10(*-ω-)

<Bronysith> Scoot-Scootaloo: is glomping RP?
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Cya Shane.

<Obsidian> Bye Alicorn_Shane
<Vivix> I hardly ever see trolls here, but its a way faster chat, so I prefer it in early mornings or when side channels are open

<CriticKitten> Ubisoft. You always know how to underwhelm your audience.
<Ponies47> CCCP: I could just make him sit down and shuda up for about 2 minutes. :|
<In_Love_Luna> Irish_Pony: <3
<CriticKitten> Open with a dancing game, yes, good move you morons.
<WingedCurse> XD
<CCCP> Ponies47: lol
<CriticKitten> Look at the audience
<Skylands> 103 days and no response? Yes
<Tov|Christmas> Where are my Jade and Payg cosplayers?
<drfsupercenter> 03well, weekend
<CriticKitten> They're like "what the actual fuck's going on"
<Ponies47> CCCP: He can be so picky. :|
<Chimera> huh.
<alexxm> CriticKitten seriously if that was me i would have shown assassins creed 3 first
<Tov|Christmas> rip headphone users
<drfsupercenter> 03I figured whoever was supposed to email me wasn't working this weekend
<WingedCurse> dat loudness
<CriticKitten> WHO THE HELL ARE YOU AND WHY SHOULD I CARE
<Ponies47> and act under his age :|
<CriticKitten> GO AWAY AGED RAPPER PERSON
<cachi01> sooo ubi stream already started?????
<Skylands> 10Show up at 9am even if they don't respond?
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't know the address of the place, is part of the problem >_
<drfsupercenter> 03*>_>
<CriticKitten> The audience is like "this is terrible"
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Off to Leson Zero.

<Om> Ninjazz|Challenge: Funs stuffs
<SirGanjalf> What's up with those rappers on video game devs conferences?
<CCCP> Ponies47: well, don't try to force it on him too much, cause if you do hes gonna end up possibly getting annoyed by it. And that will make it even harder to make him like the show.
<alexxm> SirGanjalf mony
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Om: Fan favorite too.
<drfsupercenter> 03I can google it, but often these places have more than one building
<Strange-Benhur> :)

<drfsupercenter> 03luckily they were like "oh, you want the building across the street"
<CriticKitten> Ubi, this is sad. Guys, come on. It's not hard. Play a 2 minute clip of Assassin's Creed 3 and watch your audience wet themselves. But no, you lead with shitty rap

<CriticKitten> Okay that was interesting.
<cachi01> Meanwhile: xD
<MahBoi777> Meanwhile: Lol
<sagas> Kipkat07_USAF: That is why we as humans find things to distract and entertain ourselves. To forget about reality for a while.
<Iron_Edge> Meanwhile: Iron_Edge is my OC.
<Sumica> 00,10wonder if it's Firewall
<CCCP> Kipkat07_USAF: i mean think about it, porn was much harder to find back then, and you had to pay for it!
<Meanwhile> Sumica: FIREWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALL?

<RyunosukeKnT> so... sumica x firewall shipping now
<RyunosukeKnT> :p
<Tov|Christmas> Murphy, NOOOO
<sagas> Kipkat07_USAF: CCCP does have a point...
<CCCP> Kipkat07_USAF: what about the wonderfulness of the internet?
<CriticKitten> This actually looks sort of interesting.
<Shamroc> Sumica: indeed it is
<Barbetos|AtWork> I wonder if Cardslafter even knows. SOme one should pm to check it out. =P
<Staraptor> 2Haha yeah, the hat :D
<Nick> oo

<FlareChaser> Ermm.. time to play TF2..
<RaveBrony> Who is Firewall? From a fic? O.o
<cachi01> THIS I WANTA
<Kipkat07_USAF> CCCP: That too. But outside of that, everything sucks
<CriticKitten> Like, this is kind of a legit-ish use of the Wii U tech.
<Meanwhile> God I hate the Wii.
<RyunosukeKnT> For those who dont know, Firewall is the main character and OC from a fic "Through the Eyes of Another Pony"
*Nick hides
<Shamroc> ^
<FlareChaser|TF2> Meanwhile: same, Wii sucked.
<Tov|Christmas> dat xbox controller
<RaveBrony> RyunosukeKnT: Ah! Ty :D
<Sumica> 00,10eh what RyunosukeKnT?
<Staraptor> 2:3
<CriticKitten> I'm....surprised that I see the Wii U's tech being used well. O.o
<sagas> CCCP: You know what they say, "THe internet is for porn!"
<Barbetos|AtWork> RaveBrony Through the Eyes of Another Pony. Give it a read it is really good. So good infact there is a website dedicated to animating it like the show.
<RyunosukeKnT> I am just saying, Sumica has a wierd fascination with Firewalls lately :)
<CCCP> sagas: lol dat song!
<RaveBrony> I...dont really read tho :\
<FlareChaser|TF2> Anyways, TF2 time..
<Sumica> 00,10I do?
<Meanwhile> Great. They made a fucking Ipod touch that you can play on your TV. Are you fucking kidding me?
<RaveBrony> Have fun FlareChaser|TF2 :P
<Iron_Edge> Sumica: Personally. I still dont get how people mistake you for female. idk..
<CCCP> Kipkat07_USAF: i mean i guess
<RyunosukeKnT> it seems so :)
<FlareChaser|TF2> RaveBrony: thank you thank you.
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: too long didn't read lol

<Kipkat07_USAF> CCCP: I think I was meant to be born in 1917
<Irish_Pony> Wrek|Dusty: That better be a paint brush... :|
<cachi01> ZR?
<CriticKitten> Actually....I'll admit this is sort of a cool use of the Wii U tech.
<Meanwhile> This shit is why I hate E3. It just justifies my lack of faith in the gaming industry.
<cachi01> ZR
<Darkts3> wow.. Wii u is being used great
*Skylands puts a Lucario hat on Nick's head

<ImALargeNick> hi
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ninjazz|Challenge watching MLP or something?
<Sumica> 00,10What I read the fic and wrek did alot of the art for the story so yeah I know it.
<CCCP> Kipkat07_USAF: life expectancy was much lower
<Kipkat07_USAF> CCCP: We didnt need video games back then. We could jump in the brook or plant stuff
<Shamroc> Sumica: thats kinda how i found it....lol
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Barbetos|AtWork: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-ultimate-brony-challenge.png
<CriticKitten> When I first heard of this system, I expected the tech to be used poorly just like the Wiimote's waggle was.
<Kipkat07_USAF> CCCP: And its lower now too because of obesity
<Alchemist> Im off to bed. Good night Guys!
<CriticKitten> But....that's pretty good actually.

<CCCP> Kipkat07_USAF: capitalism

<CCCP> Kipkat07_USAF: the military is much more of an asshole now indays and u can kill as many innocent people as you want and get a medal for it
<supersonic10> i personaly think Kingdom Hearts would be perfect for the Wii U
<Darkts3> BATMAN
<CriticKitten> AMERICA
<sagas> I feel Nitendo makes all their money of nostalgic old brand. None of their original stuff never seems to work
<Tov|Christmas> Aisha is awesome <3

<cachi01> MahBoi777: ikr lol
<CCCP> Kipkat07_USAF: we also have nukes
<SirGanjalf> They should've named it Dead Island: GB
<GilDash> CriticKitten: Yeah, she just seems nasty to Toby and he's just... well, likable like you said.
<Kipkat07_USAF> CCCP: Families are too detached, they dont have the same kind of feel anymore. What ever happened to the milkman? The paperboy? Evening T.V.?
<Jason> o:
<CriticKitten> Aisha's an exec trying way too hard to be likeable by gamers.

*Cat claws at the glass to escape
<CCCP> Kipkat07_USAF: it just seems that way, when you watch a movie from the 50's families are all happy and everything seems nice, older people talk about the good ol days, because they forget all the bad shit that happend. Life has never been good, and will never EVER be good.
<CriticKitten> GilDash: Fair 'nuff

<CriticKitten> That shit was a Batman move
<CriticKitten> Uh.
<Kipkat07_USAF> CCCP: family values shape our future. I could have turned out to be a dick, but I lived with seniors and I became polite and generous. But then there are factors you cant control, like introversion versus extroversion. I am an introvert and that has made me fine. But it proves my point because I lived with old people from that time so I grew up to want to be like them
<CriticKitten> Shoot him?
<CriticKitten> You....could try shooting him guys
<cachi01> nut right now im just seeing conor jumping in tress and killing deers lol

<GilDash> Meanwhile: Yes, yes I would. :D
<Irish_Pony> Wrek|Dusty: Theyre watching E3 Live instead of you :P
<Tov|Christmas> Wrek|Dusty: I don't like that question
<Meanwhile> Irish_Pony: No you're Irish, your country is basically a pub.
<Darkts3> woo
<CriticKitten> The British forces in this game are apparently idiots. Twenty or so guys with rifles there, not ONE shot him
<Iron_Edge> CCCP: It may just be me but that just sounds heartless and too...uhh....yeah pretty much heartless. And there's never an excuse for not using manners...
<RyunosukeKnT> E3 should be renamed "Advertisement for Video Games and Accessories" :)
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: Oh go shave your moustache already....
<CriticKitten> For god's sake, it was close range
<Meanwhile> Never.

<Darkts3> Nittany_Discord: =/
<Iron_Edge> CCCP: thats like me saying "CCCP I think your awesome bro, but if you were to die right now this very second. I would careless."
<CCCP> Iron_Edge: manners are the most unimportant thing ever
<pyrocatboy> CriticKitten You could see bullets wizzing by if you paid more attention.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> still loking the same to me, kill one enemy at the time while all the others just stand around politely waiting for you to kill them
<Meanwhile> I wonder if anything about Bioshock Infinity will show up.
<CriticKitten> There's "skillful assassin" and then there's "lucky as shit"
<Iron_Edge> CCCP: Thats not true! -lol- but im saying I could never honestly not care.

<Quadrenaro> is video streaming? I dont see anything
<CriticKitten> pyrocatboy: There's "suspension of disbelief" and then there's "bullshiting for the sake of making you seem more badass".
<Meanwhile> It's neat to watch.
<Ponies47> Hugs CCCP :)
<Kipkat07_USAF> CCCP: Damn... reality hit you right in the balls. That is why my life goal is to be in the air force and be a war hero
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I agree there. If gaming is about fun, why would you play it not for fun? :D

<Irish_Pony> In_Love_Luna: <3
<CriticKitten> Nice.
<CCCP> Kipkat07_USAF: yeah well you know, we dont need war any more. Its pointless millions of lives lost because the man in power wants somthing that another man in power has, or for stupid reasons like relgion. its the reason why there is so much sad ness in the world
<In_Love_Luna> Irish_Pony: <3

<CupcakeWarrior> Darkts3: What game is on E3 right now?
<In_Love_Luna> Meanwhile: :|
<GilDash> CCCP: When there isn't enough to go around, trading won't cut it.
<Quadrenaro> lol
<Meanwhile> Irish_Pony: Because I'm not constantly posting how I feel about Trixie in chat.
<Darkts3> CupcakeWarrior: idk

<GilDash> CCCP: When there *isn't* enough to go around. If you share you both die.
<Meanwhile> Irish_Pony: Funny, but also irrelevant.
<Darkts3> oh god more stop motion

<alexxm> whats it about CriticKitten
<twentypercentcooler> Is it Night, Evening, or Afternoon for you.
<CCCP> <3 <3 <3 bai
<Darkts3> damn Watch Dogs looks good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If Ubi keeps their DRM out of this game, I might get it.
<CriticKitten> alexxm: It's a hacker-type game.

<Meanwhile> Hacker type. How long before you're hacking cars and making them explode?
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Yeah, I guess that's the deal breaker for me too. I'd get it even if it were shit just because it's trying to be different.
<Om> That was probably the only good part in the game.
<Darkts3> That made this conference worth watching

<Airpuff> Hi HatsuneMikuFan :P
<Darkts3> Ghosties: IKR
<Meanwhile> I really don't believe anyone actually likes the Wii U and is just trolling.
<cachi01> Ghosties: IKR!
<AttackWithHugs> My sister and I watched the preview for Assassin's Creed 3, and she said it makes her want to start playing video games again
<Quadrenaro> I found 5 rl bronies last weekend. I played MLP theme in public place. It was super effective.
<Darkts3> Meanwhile: really?
<CupcakeWarrior> Meanwhile: Im not trolling
<Meanwhile> Really.
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: No really....
<Meanwhile> That's what I think.
<HatsuneMikuFan> Hi StupidSexyCJ and Airpuff
<cachi01> Meanwhile: i really like the wii u
<Meanwhile> I cannot believe anyone would buy that.
<StupidSexyCJ> Potential for a new Zelda game is as far as my interst goes into the Wii U
<Darkts3> Meanwhile: Really?
<Meanwhile> REALLY.
<CupcakeWarrior> Why do people hate the Wii U so much?
<cachi01> i love wii u
<Darkts3> Meanwhile: Really?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I also tried Five Guys Burgers last night, it was DOPE
<Meanwhile> Because it's a fucking stupid piece of shit.
<HatsuneMikuFan> I love the Wii U
<Ponies47> As soon as I get a new computer then I'll get 2FT. I'm sick pf all this bull(squee) that I have to deal with on this thing. Why can't it just die. :|

<Irish_Pony> Scoot-Scootaloo: Then you have officaily eaten the best burgers ever....
<CupcakeWarrior> SSX? That still exists?
<Quadrenaro> yes
<StupidSexyCJ> Capcom generally gets on my nerves too
<Ponies47> Has never played SSX :$
<cachi01> Ponies47: do it
<Meanwhile> The Wii U is just sticking an Ipod touch on your tv and giving you a bunch of redundant bullshit.
<cachi01> DO IT!
<cachi01> Meanwhile: ipad
<CupcakeWarrior> I like SSX for the completely ridicoulous moves you can do
<Om> Bears.
<Meanwhile> I have to believe no one actually wants to buy it or I'll kill myself.
<Irish_Pony> Sweet! He's gonna open crates!
<cachi01> Meanwhile: but its cool just give it a chance
<HatsuneMikuFan> SSX is one of my favrotie games
<Irish_Pony> CMON! Something really good!!!!
<Meanwhile> If I for one second think that anyone actually wants to own a Wii U my head will fucking explode in a shower of brain matter.

<CriticKitten> Though I still am holding off for a price point, since if it's too pricey, it's not getting bought no matter how cool.
<MahBoi777> In_Love_Luna: :O

<AttackWithHugs> BarbetosAMERICANSKI: It is at times, especially when there's no stream. But that's the fun because we just let our random imaginations go wild
<Meanwhile> Angel_Luna: Whether or not I like it is irrelevant, it's in the rules.

<MahBoi777> buttered toast
<Tov|Christmas> Oh, and Pops
<Staraptor> 2Then again, Mibbit
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: It's crap to me :|

<cachi01> billy and mandy was best cartoon
<MahBoi777> ^
<cachi01> IS*
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: I use to like it. Then I realized how dumb it was :|
<Irish_Pony> Sumica: I actually created Demopan 2 :P
<Nick> plus EA wanting you to think you're jusy buying the right to play the game they made
<Staraptor> 2You can do eet :D
<sagas> I dont get why everybody is hating on the Microsoft press conference. Im watching it now and im about 20 min in and its not bad.
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: #Bronies :P
<drfsupercenter> 03Nick, and this is why I don't buy games anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03it's that simple
<MahBoi777> can't wait for Halo 4
<Nick> yeah
<CupcakeWarrior> But Ubisoft is on right now
<twentypercentcooler> It's one minute to 8/7c/5p.
<Kosoveon> LOL
<cachi01> ubi already ended
<Meanwhile> Irish_Pony: I'll just pretend you never told me, for the sake of my mental well being.
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: :D:D:D:D
<Tov|Christmas> IMO So far, Ubisoft > EA > MS
<MahBoi777> oh gawd
<Nick> I bought SR3 pre-owned and even then I dont wanna play it because of all the DLC and online pass :\
<Kosoveon> and yes Ran, I'm just really anxious to finish it before I go off to college ^^;
<sagas> CupcakeWarrior: Im watching it on gametrailers
<Kosoveon> I want to give it to my parents as a parting gift of sorts
<Irish_Pony> Meanwhile: This is why were friends :D
<cachi01> Tov|Christmas: its not your opinion its a fact
<CupcakeWarrior> Its still on Ubisoft
<Tov|Christmas> Ubisoft needs moar social networking
<twentypercentcooler> It's 8/7c now. Regular Show is showing on Cartoon Network.
<Nick> and also you read about EA renting servers for BF3 now? on top of online passes, on top of the soon to be premium service, on top of xbl subscription charge if you have that
<tag365> Hello!
<MahBoi777> YAY
<MahBoi777> hello tag365
<Nick> which is why I never play online on my 360 anymore
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03well
*Tov|Christmas sings the theme song to Regular Show.
<drfsupercenter> 03at least with Xbox Live, you're paying for *actual quality service*
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL PSN
<Tov|Christmas> MBBWOOOOOOOOOWM
<CupcakeWarrior> mfw people like regular show
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL NINTENDO USING FRIEND CODES
<MahBoi777> Tov|Christmas: lolwut
<drfsupercenter> 03Granted, some games are just a bunch of 12-year olds cussing each other out
<drfsupercenter> 03others are just a bunch of 20-year olds cussing each other out
<sagas> So who is playing?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's all in waht games you choose to play :P
<Nick> I dunno what PSN is like I dont have a PS3/Vita (although thinking about)
<cachi01> sagas: wrek
<Nick> and yeah that too
<drfsupercenter> 03I signed up for PSN and then it got hacked
<CupcakeWarrior> Wow, Wrek is good with a sword
<drfsupercenter> 03which was funny as heck, I'll admit
<Nick> which is why I've changed my gaming focus to quality single player games
<cachi01> but regular show has no theme Tov|Christmas O_o
<drfsupercenter> 03as Sony deserves it
<Meanwhile> CupcakeWarrior: Viking blood.
<sagas> cachi01: Is he playing with anyone in the chat or others?
<drfsupercenter> 03but how long it took them to get it back online
<drfsupercenter> 03was just hilarious
<Nick> yeah
<Ponies47> I hate Cartoon Network now. They ruined everything. :|
<drfsupercenter> 03and Nintendo online is a joke, if you meet someone in-game, good luck playing against them ever agan
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03*again
<twentypercentcooler> For those in europe, It's 2am/1am UK now.
<Irish_Pony> Ponies47: /)
<Nick> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03so as much as people whine about paying for Xbox Live, consider the fact that it *actually works*
<cachi01> sagas: he is playing with Bronysith, FlareChaser|TF2 and i think thats it
<Nick> SSBB online
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Nick> god almighty
<Ponies47> Irish_Pony: (\

<MahBoi777> Gamer_Luna: HUZZAH
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: yay <3
<sagas> Better_Luna: Why do you keep changing your name every time I see you!?!
<twentypercentcooler> Here in the phillipines, Oggy and the Cockroaches is practicaly on Cartoon Network "all day everyday".
*CupcakeWarrior noms on Irish_Pony
<Nick> and yeah it does, but with the new trends of online passes, server rentals, premium services and nickel and diming and the fact I grew bored/frustrated by onlin gaming (ala screaming people over mikes) I have very little initiative to play online
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL yeah I know what you mean
<Gamer_Luna> sagas: Because I have diffirent feelings :)
<drfsupercenter> 03luckily I don't play games that involve screaming people over mics
<Meanwhile> To the moon Demopan
<sagas> Gamer_Luna: That makes sense
<drfsupercenter> 03like, people say Xbox 360 and everybody assumes COD and Halo, I won't touch either series with a 10 foot pole :P
<Ninjazz|Challenge> And that was Cutie Pox... Not really one of my favorite episodes. Off to... My the Best Pet Win. Song episode. SOngs are nice
<drfsupercenter> 03Minecraft on the other hand
<Nick> yeah, I was in with a great crowd when I played l4d online
*drfsupercenter hides
<Ponies47> After Cartoon Network launched Flapjack that's when they went to hell :|
<Nick> great MP that game
<Staraptor> 2The only online game I really play that involves people using mics is WoW
<drfsupercenter> 03I used to play L4D2 a lot
<cachi01> OH FLAPJACK XD
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03kinda got bored though
<AttackWithHugs> Dat air launch

<Ninjazz|Challenge> Dken2021: I am. :P
<Irish_Pony> Chowder was ok
<Gamer_Luna> CupcakeWarrior: MINE! *Grabs Irish_Pony and runs away*
<cachi01> chowder was AMAZING
<Ponies47> I hated Chowder :|
<Nick> it was simple, you just needed to play as a good team no unlocking the next weapon/class/w/e
<Irish_Pony> It had its good moments
<Tov|Christmas> Never saw Flapjack. I loved what little I saw of Chowder.
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: <3
<Dken2021> how many episodes you got left Ninjazz|Challenge?
<drfsupercenter> 03er wait

<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: <3
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Dken2021: S2 E7... 19 left.
<CupcakeWarrior> I felt like killing myself the first time I saw Flapjack
<cachi01> total drama island was ok
<Nick> plus it wasnt a straightforward soldier vs soldier FPS the infected was really great to play as
<Dken2021> well I'm just dropping by
<CupcakeWarrior> Ohai Dken2021
<Ninjazz|Challenge> You and me both, CupcakeWarrior.
<Nick> no I didn't say that I said there was none of that
<Irish_Pony> Total Drama Island was meh
<cachi01> i liked flapjack
<AttackWithHugs> I didn't care for Chowder. I thought it was utterly stupid.
<Dken2021> allo CupcakeWarrior :D
<CountDoofus> ohai

<Ninjazz|Challenge> Welcome back to us, Dken2021. :3

<CupcakeWarrior> Dken2021: Are you watching E3 right now?
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Hey CountDoofus!

<Nick> you just needed to use teamwork and valve /really/ forced that which was a good thing
<cachi01> wait sony stream already started??
<Nick> l4d 1 & 2
<Irish_Pony> Chowder did have its really good moments though :P
<Dken2021> CupcakeWarrior nah, taking class break now

<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<cachi01> Dken2021: MLP FIM is canadian
<drfsupercenter> 03I see
<Tov|Christmas> I just had a whole pizza. That should give me enough carbs to watch the PS show.
<drfsupercenter> 03I was misreading that
<CupcakeWarrior> dat Taokaka spray
<CountDoofus> pony sprays everywhere
<Nick> ok
<Gamer_Luna> Do you guys know OMG facts?They should do MLP facts :D
<Sumica> 00,10run faster engi
<Athgaar> i want that rarity one
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah Left 4 Dead is nice, I just got tired of it
<Meanwhile> If you do that the terrorists win.
<drfsupercenter> 03there's only so much you can play the same game over and over before you start hating it
<Dken2021> and my instructor is back, brb
<Ponies47> After Ed Edd n' Eddy was cancelled that's when Cartoon Network died to me. :|
<CupcakeWarrior> Tao is a silly kitty
<sagas> Gamer_Luna: Whats OMG facts?
<drfsupercenter> 03at least that's how I am
<Irish_Pony> I dont have pony sprays...not that big of a fan...yet....

<cachi01> Dken2021: indeed
<Athgaar> you can break a teleporter by using it if the exit is under a low roof
<CupcakeWarrior> Ponies47: For me it was when the last sesaon started
<Tov|Christmas> I don't even remember EA
<Ninjazz|Challenge> But ofcourse, Dken2021.
<Nick> thing is I felt it wasn't updated enough vs say tf2
<cachi01> only i liked about ea was dead space 3
<sagas> Ponies47: The greatest cartoon I had ever watched until MLP!
<Athgaar> then instead of teleporting you explode the exit
<CupcakeWarrior> Watch Dogs does not interest me
<geeky-brony> hello evry pony
<Athgaar> hey
<cachi01> hi geeky-brony
<Tov|Christmas> oh yeah, EA had Crysis
<Nick> ok it had 3 dlc packs but that was over both games I really did expect more from valve
<geeky-brony> hello cachi01
<cachi01> and crysis
<Ponies47> CupcakeWarrior: When they started going to school those where ok.
<drfsupercenter> 03TF2 is the same thing though, I don't get how people can play that forever
<GilDash> Sorry, is this Dead Space or Lost Planet, I'm confused now.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Hello geeky-brony.

<Irish_Pony> Sumica: They have the technology...they have the technology to make sappers stronger, faster, smarter...
<Darkts3> ya
<Nick> and it got lots of maps on top of infinite mods
<drfsupercenter> 03why do people even care about hats
<Athgaar> harder better faster stronger
<Tov|Christmas> enough time to rewatch Korra twice
<Nick> yeah
<Irish_Pony> I miss Duck Dogers :(
<sagas> Ponies47: (\ For Jaw Breakers!
<Nick> but it made valve a crap tonne of dough
<Sumica> 00,10or perhaps it was a realy bad engi and he was some how upgrading the sapper
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like people obsessing over avatar items on the Xbox
<drfsupercenter> 03it's silly
<drfsupercenter> 03oh I'm sure
<Ponies47> sagas: JAWBREAKERS /)
<AttackWithHugs> Ok, who just pinged me? Chat lagged.
<drfsupercenter> 03but people are stupid and will pay for anything
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: Build ALL the sentries!
<cachi01> DUCK DODGERS TO THE RE--*explodes*
<drfsupercenter> 03which is exactly why EA still exists :P
<Meanwhile> Erect ALL the dispensers!
<Tov|Christmas> Watch_Dogs intrigued me.
<Staraptor> 2If it makes them happy, then that's why
<Nick> but honestly paying real money for virutal items?
<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: Sap ALL the sentries!
<CupcakeWarrior> Hehe, erect
<cachi01> watch dogs gave me a nerdgasm
<drfsupercenter> 03I've done it a few times for XBL but very rarely
<sagas> Ponies47: (\ GRAVY!
<GilDash> Watch Dogs looks like it could be genuinely intersting.
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: ALL the sentries? :C
<Staraptor> 2We pay money for games :P
<drfsupercenter> 03most of those avatar items I don't bother with
<geeky-brony> CupcakeWarrior: -_(\

<AttackWithHugs> Meanwhile: ALL the sentries! *Lesson Zero TS face*

<drfsupercenter> 03well
<sagas> Ponies47: (\ CHICKENS!
<Meanwhile> AttackWithHugs: >_> Ok then...
<Quadrenaro> later guys!! ^^
*cachi01 erects a sentry

<Gamer_Luna> They're putting Friends on Nick at nite! :D
<cachi01> bye Quadrenaro
<drfsupercenter> 03discs get scratched and damaged

<CupcakeWarrior> Gamer_Luna: Yay~
<Ponies47> sagas: SCOOTALOO'S /)
<superretroworld> Gamer_Luna: they already did that
<drfsupercenter> 03all it does is install it to Steam
<cachi01> Gamer_Luna: DAFUQ WHY?
<Nick> its just the feeling that they're paying real money for something that really, doesn't exist, it's virtual
<geeky-brony> Gamer_Luna: hello
<drfsupercenter> 03and then you toss the disc in a closet and it collects dust
<Staraptor> 2Aye
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why >paying money
<cachi01> i dont like friends
<drfsupercenter> 03you see where I'm coming from?
*drfsupercenter hides
<AttackWithHugs> What's the name of this map? I forgot but I have played it before.
<sagas> I feel their should be a cartoon throwback to about 8 years ago
<Nick> yeah drf but all games digital or not will get servers shut down
<Nick> like EA's
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why >piracy
<superretroworld> Ponies47: PONIES /)
<sagas> Ponies47: (\ PLANK!
<drfsupercenter> 03Then you can play it all you want
<drfsupercenter> 03and not bother with the stupid DRM
<drfsupercenter> 03what's your point LOL
*Gamer_Luna hugs geeky-brony "Hey Bro!"
<WingedCurse> what server is this?
<Ponies47> Duck Dodger's was ok. Unlike that other Looney Tunes Show *Shivers*
<Nick> yeah...its stuff like that that pushes piracy
<geeky-brony> Gamer_Luna: good how u
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly.
<Nick> doesn't stop it
<drfsupercenter> 03it's why I don't buy games for the most part
<Irish_Pony> Ponies47: /) Erm...CANKCARS!
<cachi01> the new looney tunes show is cool
<Sumica> 00,10captain obvious to the rescue
<Staraptor> 2I love buying games I know I'll enjoy
<Irish_Pony> Sumica: YA!
<drfsupercenter> 03I buy all of the Humble Indie Bundles because those make a point of being DRM-free
<AttackWithHugs> cachi01: Pizzariba!
<drfsupercenter> 03and they let you pay what you want
<Ponies47> superretroworld: (\ PONIES!
<drfsupercenter> 03well how would you know if you like a game just from watching footage?
<Ponies47> sagas: PLANK! /)
<Nick> basically what it is as my dad says: 'we are customer, customer pays your wages, you need to give customer what customer wants, not what you want'
<drfsupercenter> 03It's like movie trailers, it could be complete garbage for all you know
<Staraptor> 2Because I know myself pretty well
*Tov|Christmas laughs just by recalling Lola Bunny
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but I mean preordering games
<Gamer_Luna> geeky-brony: Great! Irish_Pony hasn't left yet,so I'm very happy :)
<Staraptor> 2Or I borrow someone's game
<drfsupercenter> 03how do you know it's any good :P
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's not even out
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: <3

<AttackWithHugs> Lola is the one that makes all blondes look stupid.
*CupcakeWarrior explodes
<Gamer_Luna> ZAMBAMBOES
<drfsupercenter> 03people waited even longer for Duke Nukem Forever
<drfsupercenter> 03and it sucked
<junh1024-XD> i buy games, but don't play them
<drfsupercenter> 03what of it :P
<AttackWithHugs> I want to kick her sometimes.
<Staraptor> 2I don't like Duke Nukem, that's what :P
<Tov|Christmas> Still Lola was hilarious only because the rest of the looney tunes were toned down and boring.
<Irish_Pony> AttackWithHugs: Hey im blonde :[
<drfsupercenter> 03<junh1024-XD> i buy games, but don't play them <- same really, which is why I stopped buying games
<Ponies47> The Looney Tunes Show is a joke. :|
<Nick> oh god DNF
<drfsupercenter> 03my Steam library has like 120 games
<Nick> what an embrassment
<drfsupercenter> 03I've played all of... 2?
<Athgaar> but 40K and MLP have already been crossed I'm pretty sure
<Meanwhile> That guy must not have seen the 40K crossover pics.
<cachi01> the looney tunes show is awesome
*CupcakeWarrior never liked Looney Tunes
<superretroworld> they tried to make lola a sex symbol, so gross
<otakon> Okay guys, just came in to say hi
<Meanwhile> Yeah my thoughts exactly Athgaar.
<CupcakeWarrior> I prefered Tom and Jerry

<Saturn> 08,01but i really needed to get that out there
<Nick> I watched a vid of Jim sterling and talked about stupid pricing of DD games and how devs/pubs will still charge the same price despite their saying it'll be cheaper for them (but not for you) and this game on Vita's PSN store is like $40
<sagas> Saturn: I dont know... The universe is a big place...

<Saturn> 08,01inb4 he kicks me just to prove me wrong :P
*cachi01 has watched all the spongebob episodes

<CriticKitten> Calcos323: Also, would rather buy a half-assed sequel than a shitty new IP. Guess that just makes me one of those silly gamers who would rather have an average game in a known franchise than a terrible new one.

<ND|Busy> 11,01I just have reservations based on their past.
<SirGanjalf> Ghosties: Hey, this series had tower defense already
<CriticKitten> Two terrible games and ideas, followed by two games NOT EXCLUSIVE TO THEIR CONSOLES.
<Ponies47> twilight_sprinkle: He's such a loser. He doesn't even have a freakin job. All he does is just sit around and get drunk :|

<Ghosties> 04But SHIP BATTLES
<Renard> SuperBrony64, yes, AC3 comes out on Wii U
<Ghosties> 04HORY SHET
<Reikim> ND|Busy: Ubi makes either incredibly lousy games or incredibly good ones. It's a mixed bag.
<Stallion_of_War> What do you mean? I've liked A.C. II so far much more than A.C 1
<kirzstryfe> 8,6tower defense is awesome
<sagas> This is kinda boring
<CriticKitten> So thus far, Sony has shown us nothing that is both their product AND cool

<Gumri> oh when is that? I got the time wrong for the Sony one, having thought that starts when it finishes :/
<Darkts3> rofl... Goatmen seem original
<Reikim> inb4 he gets all his equipment taken away at the beginning.
<Gumri> :O
<FlareChaser|Assassin> WE NEED BLIZZARD AT E3.
<GilDash> Om: Does anyone have High ecpectations of any of these companies? :S
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Om: Most major publishers in fact.
<Reikim> Starts at 9.
*Stallion_of_Assassin Stallion_of_War

<Stallion_of_Assassin> ...
<Cypresswolf> still as violent as ever
<Sumica> 00,10wow and that weapon was just in some guys back
<Renard> Everything seems sooooo booooring after that interactive book presentation
<tehRequital|Drawing> FlareChaser|Assassin: blizz is too good for that
<Kandarihu> An open ending, so that the franchise can end when the publisher wants it to, not the devs?
<Golden_Mic> WE NEED PONIES AT e3
<Om> GilDash: Ehhh. No. I guess not
<Stallion_of_War> THIS PLEASES US!
<Gumri> any idea what that is GMT?
<OtakuTom> It's a prequel, Reikim, so he shouldn't have the weapons to begin with.
<Om> Ninjazz|Challenge: Yeah....
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Let's see...Microsoft let me down...Sony isn't doing anything spectacular yet...oiy....
<sagas> This looks exactly the same as it previose games. Exactly what they do with the MW series, only even worse
<Sumica> 00,10Nice CriticKitten
<SuperBrony64> 11,02NINTENDO
<Darkts3> OOOOOO

<FlareChaser|Assassin> SuperBrony64: EA only said stuff about DLC.
<Reikim> Um, who pinged?
<Ninjazz|Challenge> SuperBrony64: Inb4 they fail as well.
<Renard> SuperBrony64, nope. Not even Nintendo.
<BlueFlare> 02I refused to cheat
*Gumri is from the future
<mario_pony> I'll Take 50!!!
<Sumica> 00,10can we atleast make sure the guy demoing the game is good at it?
<cachi01> NINTENDO, SONY AND UBISOFT R REALLY MAKING MY DAY :)
<CupcakeWarrior> By the way, how was Microsoft?
<Renard> I think I'll just stop playing.
<Cypresswolf> Still looks like a lot of button mashing to me, though
<CriticKitten> Why yes, it's God of War. We get it.
<Renard> And that's it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Nintendo has a new console, they're going to own all.
<Golden_Mic> FlareChaser: Dead space 3.
<pony_1471> wheres the sss ranked combos what a nub

<FlareChaser|Assassin> see ya pyro
<Reikim> SuperBrony64: The most hilarious thing that could possibly happen? HL3 on Wii U.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> SuperBrony64: Oh that would be so hillarious.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Too bad Sega Saturn was rushed to the market
<BlueFlare> 02is it just me, or were most of the cheaters metal marios?
<BlueFlare> 02XD

<Reikim> Sumica: Saturn suffered from poor marketing.
<Gumri> ah well i'll stay on :D
<Sumica> 00,10I saw that same trick in redfaction arma
<cachi01> WOWOWOO PRINCE OF WAR?
<Kandarihu> Well, Nintendo's going to be out the gate with their new console before the others. And that pretty much means that the 720 and PS4 will be new and fresh when the WiiU becomes familiar.
<Reikim> 4 am. Dammit.
<FlareChaser|Assassin> SUDDENLY, Left 4 Dead 3.
<Obsidian> Why does he have this power?
<TheBest> lol
<CriticKitten> So God of War is now going to shamelessly steal an idea from Prince of Persia?
<Renard> Sega Saturn had no devkit. :<
<Reikim> I believe I'm in that timezone too...
<Renard> Wonder why it failed
<CriticKitten> INNOVATION
<Ninjazz|Challenge> FlareChaser|Assassin: I am couting on it!

<Stallion_of_War> RELEASE THE KRACKEN
<Cypresswolf> That's more like it :)
<DuskStarshimmer> MASH X to not die
<Kandarihu> Whatever. I might as well look at it this way. Wii U is coming before the EMP.
<CriticKitten> Wow this guy sucks

<Ninjazz|Challenge> FlareChaser|Assassin: Dude, serriously, Orange Box 2. L4D2, HL3, and TF3. I swear, man.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Wow...like I haven't seen this a million times before ._.
<Meanwhile> I always like Kratos for just being a miserable bugger who guts everyone he meets.
<pony_1471> hammerteim
<FlareChaser|Assassin> Needs more Portal 3, Half-Life 3, and Left 4 Dead 3.
<Om> Kratos saved someone?
<Darkts3> Wow the guy demoing the game sucks
<mario_pony> Quadrenaro: you're boring:|
<Om> Thats new.

<FillyFlam> Sumica: The number at the end of the title.
<Gumri> so spain, very west of france and west africa
<Darkts3> imagine if he failed a button mashing sequence
<CupcakeWarrior> Protip: Get a good player to demo your gam
<Sumica> 00,10seems leget
<DuskStarshimmer> With how well valve wrapped up portal 2 I would not be amazed to see a portal 3, or even like a portal prequil
<Darkts3> xD
<ekips> hm I thought you were streaming E3 and not one of the old God of War titles...>.>
<Reikim> Nah, I'm in east Canada, so I'll be 3 or so hours behind.
<OtakuTom> There is no number at the end of this one, FillyFlam :P
<CriticKitten> Remember how you said "God I wish boss battles were full of QTEs in God of War"? YOU'VE BEEN HEARD
<Golden_Mic> cupcaaaaaakes so sweet & tasty

<CCCP> sagas: they just said please and then kicked me :(
<Gumri> ha. It's always useful to know what time you are in relation to GMT+00
<SirGanjalf> Ok, so Kratos is hacking and slashing monster#265, can we move on?
<sagas> Thats one angry pachaderm
<FlareChaser|Assassin> SuperBrony64: alright, I lost all faith in everything else except Valve, Blizzard, and Nintendo.
<Litwick> Dumbo Dude!
<CCCP> CriticKitten: why was i kicked?
<Cypresswolf> This looks like the end of the new Clash of the Titans to me
<Mutterguy> oh it's a Loxo. they stole that from the monster manual 2
<Sumica> 00,10Sure it looks nice
<CriticKitten> CCCP: I'unno
<CupcakeWarrior> This is so god damn stupid
<DuskStarshimmer> sooo.... are they trying to show off inovative stuff? or are they just broign an audiance?
<Kandarihu> DuskStarshimmer: now that Chell is free, there needs to be a Half-Life/Portal crossover.
<Gumri> because then you can work out what time it is in other places
<Stallion_of_War> SirGanjalf: NO, WE WILL NOT MOVE ON. YOUR STALLION OF WAR WISHES TO WATCH THIS!
<RustyMeat> RAGE
<CCCP> CriticKitten: yes u do :|

<Ninjazz|Challenge> I think I had enough of this in GoW3...
<Sumica> 00,10but eh so what it's been done, by you guys already
<Reikim> I dunno, this is kind of underwhelming.
<sagas> SirGanjalf: This is exactly like every other God of War. Nothing new here
<Golden_Mic> Kratos' new spam move for mugen.
<DuskStarshimmer> Kandarihu, that would be nice to see, seing as how thier based in the same mythical russian teratory
<RyunosukeKnT> seriously, how is this different from any other GoW game? :)
<CriticKitten> CCCP: Yeah no, I don't
<FlareChaser|Assassin> INB4 BLIZZARD COMES IN ANNOUNCING WARCRAFT 4

<FlareChaser|Assassin> Golden_Mic: who plays CoD anymore?

<Mutterguy> Actually... Blizzard is due to release a no MMO...
<LordCelestia> 0,5CriticKitten ITS SO SMOOTH I CANT TAKE IT

<Reikim> inb4 shock moment
*DuskStarshimmer Moos
<ND|Busy> A new game? You can't be serious?
<FlareChaser|HL3> Meanwhile: google it.
<Gamer_Luna> do you ponies know they make BBQ flavored popcorn?
<Golden_Mic> no zombies, just apocolypse
<Darkts3> ND|Busy: ya its new
<Reikim> FlareChaser|HL3: Your nick is overly hopeful.
<Meanwhile> FlareChaser|HL3: Cba
<CupcakeWarrior> I thought Crash was owned by another company
<DuskStarshimmer> Stallion_of_War, thank you for your freaky knowlege of I am legend ^_^
<Quadrenaro> Spyro 1, 2, and 3 remastered!
<Renard> SUDDENLY SEAPONIES
<cachi01> Golden_Mic: yes there are zombies
<Galloran> Gamer_Luna i have had it on many the occasion
<CountDoofus> Have they announced a MLP game yet?
<RyunosukeKnT> its kinda like... mad max?
<Om> Doesn't look THAT fancy.
<sagas> DuskStarshimmer: Careful what you wish for or youll get g3.5 ponies
<Golden_Mic> Gamer_Luna: I LOVE THOSE!
<RustyMeat> only 4 bullets
<Obsidian> Stealth Mode
<Stallion_of_War> DuskStarshimmer: Post-Apocalyptic Distopias are a favourite of mine.
<SirGanjalf> Golden_Mic: There will be zombies/monsters
<DuskStarshimmer> also, technically "zombie" isnt proper descriptor for anything
<FlareChaser|HL3> Reikim: lolwut
<Ninjazz|Challenge> I can so hear Nolan in this.

<SirGanjalf> It's kinda like "I am Legend" the game
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> dat struggle
<Reikim> So I'm having Deus Ex 3 flashbacks here.
<Golden_Mic> ASSANARION!

<Litwick> Takle a drink for every fuck!
<sagas> Gamer_Luna said something without Iron_Pony flirting! Impossibru!
<CupcakeWarrior> So many beeps
<Sumica> 00,10damn tourist
<Renard> Uncharted with less shooting? Hey, why not
<CriticKitten> It looks a lot like Uncharted or the like right now, there's a distinct lack of zombies
<DuskStarshimmer> is this a rockstar game?
<Reikim> inb4 protecting the girl becomes a hassle.
<Darkts3> oh god the Ai is embarassing the player
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Holy shit...
<DuskStarshimmer> it looks to well lit to be a rockstar game, nm
<cachi01> DuskStarshimmer: naughty dog
<Kandarihu> It's poetic justice, I think. Crash Bandicoot got his start ridiculing Mario for being so far behind the times. Nowadays Mario has innovated more, and Sony's ditched him in favor of almost ordinary humans.
<Ninjazz|Challenge> DuskStarshimmer: Naughty Dog.
<CupcakeWarrior> This game still looks meh
<sagas> still, im inb4 zombies show up
<Sumica> 00,10wait non regening health?! what an inovation
<Meanwhile> Surprise hobo

<CriticKitten> Audience applauds for a useful partner, isn't that a damning statement for the industry?
<CountDoofus> What's that? An AI that helps??
<Reikim> Darkts3: Things are looking up here!
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Last of Us, people. Put in on your watchlist.
<DuskStarshimmer> scriped event is scripted
<Kandarihu> Yeah. I'm gonna have to turn this down because all the language.

<Reikim> That last game was the best.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It wasn't atrocious like M$ and EA.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WII U
<FillyFlam> Nittany_Discord: Last of Us kind of made that whole thing.

<Meanwhile> Wii U is the worst thing to happen all E3.
<Ghosties> 04Sony was redeemed with The Last of Us
<cachi01> inb4 gabe newell comes out and shouts THREE!!! and gets out of stage
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Their Brawl clone hurt them a lot.
<CriticKitten> Nittany: Sony did pitifully. They advertised mostly games that weren't even theirs exclusively.
*DuskStarshimmer is bored by Sony
*MahBoi777 glomps Hodiku
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Sony is better than Micro$oft because of Last of Us. <3
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> okay dat The Last of Us demo was pretty damn impressive
<DuskStarshimmer> I need some hugs
<Reikim> SirGanjalf: inb4 Gabe rolls in and trolls us.
<Darkts3> The Last of Us is Truely the LAST of good games PS has to offer
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: Nothing new or spectacular, just kinda meh
<Darkts3> haha
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: All of it hurt except for that last game.
<CriticKitten> Nittany: The games that were actually theirs? THE WORST GARBAGE OF THE SHOW.
<Quadrenaro> Conference wrap up! Conference wrap up!
<Welsh_Pony> Wonderbook hurt sony in this e3
<FlareChaser|HL3> lol
<Gumri> what game is thissorry?
<Golden_Mic> SOLID SNAKE!
<Darf14> lol
<Darkts3> AM I RIGHT OR AM I RIGHT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's E3. Sequels and motion controls.
*Hodiku drops his tray of muffins and tacos! Oh noes! who will eat them now?
<Quadrenaro> Conference wrap up! Conference wrap up!
*DuskStarshimmer hugs self
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Holy Crap. ~
<sagas> Rhubenstein!
<Kandarihu> Well, we need to hold everyone to equal standards. Sure, Half-Life 3 is going to be exciting. But we should expect innovation from Valve just as we expect innovation from everyone else.
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Because Sony kind of doesn't actually own that many good games.
<RyunosukeKnT> meh at best
<Tov|Christmas> hm. That was ok, I guess. Nothing special. Ho Hum
<Mutterguy> yes CRAP
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So much bullshit being spouted now.
<Darkts3> HAHAHAHA.. lier
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01By the post-show.
<Reikim> This girl is not a gamer.
<DuskStarshimmer> easily impressed lady is easily impressed
<cachi01> REMEMBER GUUYS FAT GUY ON SCREEN = HL3
<Om> That last game looked good, everything else...Meh
<Sumica> 00,10payed anouncers are payed
<RyunosukeKnT> last of us looks decent though, not spectacular, but decent enough
<Ninjazz|Challenge> How much do I get when Orange Box 2 is announced?
<Stallion_of_War> A whole new level; and by new, I mean books...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02lol, they just start talking about the last game
<Reikim> cachi01: NO! YOU'VE JINXED IT!
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> stop reading the teleprompter and tell us what you really think!
<OtakuTom> I want to see Jeff Keighly interview Reggie again like last year XD
<Welsh_Pony> "I'm getting payed to say this"
<Golden_Mic> REPORTERS ARE NOOBS.
<sagas> I wonder how much they are being paid to be excted about this?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: i just hope the asshole fans stop bothering Gaben, recently 10k of them rioted...
<Darkts3> LOL what about the other stuff ppl?
<SirGanjalf> Did i missed Valve conference?
<pony_1471> dead space 3 last of us and tomb raider all look good
<Darf14> huh, I assume that both conferences werent that good huh?
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Sort of the point, really. Their big spin is how successful they are, yet their only offered products are ASS. The best parts of their show were games that aren't theirs.
<Meanwhile> Reporters are always noobs.
<DuskStarshimmer> I think their gunna change teh color, its gunan be the turquoise box or soemthing
<Quadrenaro> payed anouncers are payed
<cachi01> SO INTESNE WOO
<FillyFlam> How many times did I grunt?
<FillyFlam> Zero.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01would love gamers to take the business aspects of gaming back.
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Ironic, isn't it?
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Deboo... Lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spoilers!
<Sumica> 00,10mythoddy

<Reikim> Nitt's a dreamer.
<WingedCurse> spoilers XD
<Om> Wuno play deboo?
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle: Wow. Valve is becoming Real Life Dethklok?
*CupcakeWarrior dusts Nittany_Discord
<twilight_sprinkle> megahuge dudes brah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Those fuckers spoiled GoW 3.

<Chimera> WIN
<Galloran> i heard skype

<CountDoofus> dat Skype
<Sumica> 00,10dat skype
<Welsh_Pony> I wanted to play GOW3 too:(
<NewDCD> 09,01The Last of Us looked pretty good
<Galloran> Agreed
<GabeMoist> Dat DCD
<Golden_Mic> DONT KILL MORGAN FREEMAN KRATOS
<Darkts3> NewDCD: ikr
<Darkts3> ya wth did she do
<Meanwhile> Hmm. Trailers are meant to look good.
<Renard> So so want this magic book game thing!
<BlueFlare> 02lmao, someone was still trying to cheat on MK7
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: except that Gaben is a nice guy and should be left in peace
<CupcakeWarrior> ^
<Stallion_of_War> Elephant god from Hinduism; looks like Kratos is still killing gods
<DuskStarshimmer> Expensive DLC? Idgaf
<Ninjazz|Challenge> NewDCD: You mean So Awesome~
<Reikim> The Last of Us looked, to me, like the only truly exciting game there. And it's on a console I refuse to own.
<BlueFlare> 02didn't work
<BlueFlare> 02:D
<Darf14> ^
<CriticKitten> REPORTER IS BLATANT LIAR
<CupcakeWarrior> NewDCD: But the real star of the show was the Magic Book of Spells
<CriticKitten> BOOK OF SPELLS WAS SHIT.
<Athgaar> they're praising the fucking book
<Galloran> i dont like the reporter on the right
<Darkts3> HOW MUCH THEY PAYING YOU TWO?
<sagas> I feel like valve games or nothing more than the pure embodyness of wishing, hoping, and hype. They are theoretical entities that have no physical form
<Renard> Still better than a 360
<RankWinner> Screw it, only half past 3 AM
<RankWinner> Good night people
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle: certainly. What I meant is that Valve fanboys are becoming like Dethklok fanboys
<Stallion_of_War> Cool;I don't think that word means what you think it means
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I turned off stream.
<Reikim> I don't like dumb blondes.
<cachi01> THE LAST OF US LOOKED FUCK THERE ARE NO FUCKING WORDS TO EXPRESS HOW AWESOME I FEEL ABOUT THE LAST OF US
<pony_1471> that fake acting
<Ninjazz|Challenge> ...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The 360 needs to die now.
<TheRainbowDash> Holy shit....:D
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: oh definitely
<Golden_Mic> CriticKitten: NO SHIT
<sagas> The book thing is a FUCKING EYE TOY!
<Stallion_of_War> Assassin's Creed III :)
<DuskStarshimmer> Its costs me fouty thousand dollars to have these advatisers talk for twelve seconds
<LordCelestia> 0,5My body is fucking ready :3
<derpy_pony> dude....
<Darkts3> BOW CHICKA WOW WOW
<FlareChaser|HL3> I<3AssassinsCreedGIMMIENOW
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's more of an adbox than a console now.
<Paladin_Drakkenwolf> Stop reading your damn teleprompter and tell us how you really feel!
<Ninjazz|Challenge> BACK TO PONIES.
<Golden_Mic> HE SAID MY BODY IS READY
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Kinect needs to die.
<Darf14> Huh, a reporter used My Body is Ready Meme
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That too.
<Reikim> cachi01: You want to describe it? HELPFUL SUPPORTING CHARACTER. Done.
<sagas> Did he just mispronounce ubisoft?
<Renard> Nittany_Discord, it always was
<cachi01> HIS BODY IS READY
<Chimera> OH MY GOD
<RyunosukeKnT> tbh, I really am looking foward to Dust514, its like...CoD'ish, set in the future, with upgradable hardsuits and weapons, but the real spot is that it is PS3 exclusive, but will communicate with EVE :)
<Chimera> IT'S REAL
<Chimera> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5BLgycbUog
<Meanwhile> Jesus alright, The Last of Us looked ok but there's no need to abuse your shift key.
<Athgaar> DuskStarshimmer: Stop paying them for the love of Celestia
<cachi01> Reikim: XD
<Chimera> BAHAHAHAHAH
<tehRequital|Drawing> FlareChaser|HL3: dawww http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-tastes-like-classic.gif
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But it's awful now.
<Golden_Mic> Nijazz: YES!
<derpy_pony> finally some people who dress normally
<CountDoofus> My body will be ready once I get AC: Revelations out the way...
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz|Challenge: Video games that involves ponies, now, console games and cheap stuff, now.
<CupcakeWarrior> My body is ready for anything
<Gumri> conference wrap up <3
<CCCP> daww tehRequital|Drawing
<Renard> Come on, paying a fee to play online
<pony_1471> what dis
<Darkts3> Wat?
<Renard> the fuck
<FlareChaser|HL3> tehRequital|Drawing: dawww
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Actually, I don't know why I'm trying to defend any of it. :D
<DuskStarshimmer> Athgaar, theve been hijacked by mercs, I cant stop them
<Phase4> wudis?
<Gumri> e3 has been sooo bad this year
<Reikim> This song...I know it.
<Galloran> Bah Humbug
<Darkts3> Lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Renard: That's the #1 reason I don't play my 360.
<tehRequital|Drawing> ...
<Reikim> Oh my god!
<TheRainbowDash> Oh cool, racing stuff.:)
<Stallion_of_War> Well, time for Assassin's Creed II
<cachi01> LBPKARTING YAAAY
<Reikim> That's Anamanaguchi!
<sagas> This song is catchy
<Ninjazz|Challenge> TheRainbowDash: And to think that we're supposed to moving forward... =__=
*Reikim fangasms
<Galloran> I never got into LBP
<DuskStarshimmer> If I can dream it I can make in in gmod already
<twilight_sprinkle> Gaben is too awesome for E3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I buy multi-platform games on PS3 or PC.
<Darf14> If I recall, someone made a Little Big Planet MLP game on there
<cachi01> THIS SONG... ANAMANAGUCHI?
<Sumica> 00,10little big carte raceing
<Ninjazz|Challenge> My brother would love this.
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz|Challenge: Yes, without the ponies, no game is valuable.
<Kandarihu> I can just about imagine it now. In the Metalocalypse universe, the crazy fans are actually in the minority, and there are far more ordinary sane fans who just enjoy the metal and do their best to make their world a LESS brutal place to live in.
<Reikim> sagas: Anamanaguchi. Also responsible for the eargasm that was the Scott Pilgrim game's soundtrack.
<DuskStarshimmer> Spore 2?
<Renard> The Subscription business model is the worst business model ever
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: why are u so awesome?
<Galloran> SPORE 2?
<DuskStarshimmer> :3
<Cypresswolf> so in essence, it's like Mario Kart on a Playstation...
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: What a weird concept.
<Flair> Reikim: /)
<Shamroc> dat mod racers
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: There are too many gullible gamers to change things.
<cachi01> SPORE 2? HELL NAW
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: 'Cause I am silly filly, derp.:D
<Reikim> Flair: (\
<Renard> Stay away from anything asking you to subscribe with a monthly fee
<Renard> the end
<Golden_Mic> Looks legitly boss
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: :D
<Ninjazz|Challenge> TheRainbowDash: But, ponies is not the issue. :S
<Darkts3> LOL
<Reikim> That song saved it.
<RyunosukeKnT> looks okay
<Darf14> Hes driving a Boxing Glove, your argument is invalid
<Darkts3> Go Kart Game
<LordCelestia> 0,5Kevin bacon? works for me
<Sumica> 00,10who?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They'll buy anything w/o thinking of how they're being milked.
<FlareChaser|HL3> I got balls of feel..
<CupcakeWarrior> Stream shows LBP, while the tv shows GOW
<FillyFlam> Yeeeeeeeah.
<cachi01> LBP TRAILERS ALWAYS HAVE AWESOME SONGS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or screwed over.
<CriticKitten> That female reporter has lost the right to speak.
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: so is this the end of e3?
<CriticKitten> She praised Book of Spells.
<SirGanjalf> Is it Valve time now?
*Reikim is still in shock from unexpected Anamanaguchi
<FillyFlam> "Sackboy"
<DuskStarshimmer> I would totaly buy spore 2 is they UI was less abd
<teh|PheonixWright> FlareChaser|HL3: feel?
<CriticKitten> SHE HAS NO RIGHT TO SPEAK.
<Darkts3> theres still Nintendo's WII U YAH
<sagas> Galloran: Only if they do it like they prommised when they showed Spore at e3 and not fuck it up to make it more appealing
<Renard> The 90's generation is shedding tears
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spore 2?
<Sumica> 00,10she's not that great to look at either
<Meanwhile> Your spoilers are spoiler.
<Everlasting_Joy> Renard: Yes.
<FlareChaser|HL3> teh|PheonixWright: feel.
<Darf14> Nintendo's Conference is tomorrow so its not over yet :)

<Sumica> 00,10screnshots for great lols
<Ninjazz|Challenge> AMAZEBALLZ in chat? Better hook up with Saturn.

<drf|laptop> 03yeah :/
<Skylands> 10Burn her with fire
<Pinkies4thWall> /) FillyFlam
<Chimera> drf you're missing the point lol
<sagas> cachi01: I wanted and saved for that game for 2 years, the only game ive ever saved for that early before release. Then they went and fucked it up
<Chimera> That's their official channel
<Chimera> they ripped off smash bros
<CupcakeWarrior> This presentation almost makes me want to throw away my PS3
<Chimera> and their tags
<FillyFlam> Pinkies4thWall: (\
<Chimera> ARE SMASH BROS
<HyperMetalLugia> exactly?
<HyperMetalLugia> big deal
<Chimera> But liek
<HyperMetalLugia> IT IS STUPID
<HyperMetalLugia> :V
<Sumica> 00,10Sony must not be alowed to live it down
<BlueFlare> 02that's like Nintendo not havn't Mario or Link in smash bros
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Meanwhile: If you still have the stream in freeze frame, this is your amazeballs image.
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<Chimera> it's just hte fact they even did that xD
<cachi01> lol sagas dont beleave eveyrthing MS says
<BlueFlare> 02having*
<Ponies47> :P ood-eldood-a-kcoc
<HyperMetalLugia> Well it was semi-obvious
<Reikim> Sumica: TO THE FACEBOOKS
<CupcakeWarrior> Looking at the trailer
<drf|laptop> 03yeah OK, so Sony admits they're lame
<drf|laptop> 03what else is new
<Chimera> no it was obvious
<XAX> god damn its a strain on the eyes to read chat on IRC when you have your PC plugged into the TV and you're trying to read it from back on the couch
<Athgaar> Reikim: I'm pretty sure the amazeballs were directed at something else. Possibly the book.
<XAX> -_-
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: it's basically SSB knockoff god knows how many years late?
<CupcakeWarrior> 630 likes, refresh, 661 dislikes XD
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: You know the internet won't let this go. It is the internet after all.
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz|Challenge: Shush, spoilers.
<Chimera> Um drf
<HyperMetalLugia> Sony and their wonderbooks too (AR 3DS go?)
<Ninjazz|Challenge> :D
<Cypresswolf> Well, I guess it's back to my S3 Bingo project....added 43-45 tonight, still have a ways to go yet
<Sumica> 00,10exactly
<Chimera> usually they say they're amazing :p
<Chimera> and yeah the wonderbook rips off the AR system so much >>
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Ugh... This E3...
<Cypresswolf> Running out of ideas
<Chimera> that was a boring E3.
<Pinkies4thWall> I LAUGH AT THE FAIL
<sagas> cachi01: It wasnt Microsoft, It was Will Wright the maker of the Sims
<Sumica> 00,10well yeah we all know it is Pinkies4thWall but the fact that they even say it on there own youtube.
<HyperMetalLugia> Full of advertising and ripoffs
<BlueFlare> 02drf, all the bashing on PS is getting old :U
<Reikim> And Sony doesn't even conceal it! Official video and the tags are "Super smash bros"! Sony, you are /pathetic/. Completely /shameless/.
<CupcakeWarrior> Book of Magic is best pony
<Kandarihu> CupcakeWarrior: don't. If you don't want to play any more PS3 games, just make it a dedicated Folding@Home machine. Help cure diseases. But don't bother with Cancer, because that's about to be licked without protein folding.
<HyperMetalLugia> I watched some of the MS E3 too
<Kosoveon> yeah, let's bash mircosoft instead
*Kosoveon runs
<XAX> Can you increase text size on mIRC? My eyes are killing me...
<thegt90> hey is there any good mlp games on the net
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Amazeballz is best adjective.
<HyperMetalLugia> And I really do think that the Halo 4 HUD looks Metroid primey :|
<BlueFlare> 023>mircosoft
<drf|laptop> 03I wasn't bashing anybody
<drf|laptop> 03I said I didn't care
<HyperMetalLugia> > Microsoft
<sagas> cachi01: They sucked all the complexity and depth from it
<Reikim> thegt90: Check out Fighting is MAgic.
<Athgaar> Amazeballs is actually a noun
<Chimera> http://www.tssznews.com/2012/06/04/the-tangent-microsoft-e3-2012-press-conference/
<Chimera> sports
<thegt90> ok

<drf|laptop> 03kths
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Damn.

<Quadrenaro> Amazeballs are best balls
<Om> Ninjazz|Challenge: You seemed to get over your shock of the new word quickly.
<HyperMetalLugia> I'll get the terminal up then
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Om: Time heals all wounds.
<Reikim> So this buffer is basically amazeballs.
<drf|laptop> 03hah
<drf|laptop> 03I see what you did there
<Athgaar> Speaking of which, my throat still really hurts
<BlueFlare> 023It’s Microsoft, what do you expect?
<Darf14> Surely I will make a effort to be at E3 2013 ......well unless the Mayan's are wrong *and will be wrong*

<Darf14> *until*
<Reikim> Scoot-Scootaloo: Also, it is actually possible to have a badass little girl as a helpful AI partner. Our minds were blown.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Nah, Aisha was a bitch.

<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: fix it by getting the trololo song stuck in your head as a tribute to the now-deceased king of trolls

<SunderlandPony89> SuperBrony64: Take that disk out of your disk tray and THROW IT ON THE GROUND!
<FlareChaser> SuperBrony64: no one loves CoD here :|
<valoreins> was Sony as bad as Microsoft at E3?

<sagas> Is this SuperBrony64? He should play some MW3 multiplayer
<Saturn> 08,01XAX: no, but i can hit people over the head with it
<BlueFlare> 02I’m surprised. Usually Sony is smarter than that
<Athgaar> valoreins: Yes, except for two things
<XAX> Saturn: Damn. That way, you could have given your victim a slow, painful death.
<HyperMetalLugia> LEAVE THE SONY ALONE! ;-;
<Darf14> So far Microsoft > Sony at E3
<XAX> but hitting is just as good
<Saturn> 08,01XAX: also, stabbity stabbity

<Reikim> inb4 Saturn reveals that he has a hidden, spring-loaded knife in his umbrella.
<BlueFlare> 02don't get me wrong, I like Sony. But that game is a bit much XD
<BlueFlare> 02brb
<SunderlandPony89> sagas: NO! Worst idea!
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: Why do you own such a terrible game?
<Meanwhile> The numbers Mason.
<Darf14> Good thing I only rented this game at Red Box
<XAX> I might actually watch the stream today, seeing i plugged the PC into the TV. I'm having to use the windows Magnifier tool to read chat :l
<Obsidian> Why do you torture us SuperBrony64?
<pony_8157> Hey, this is a random and strange question, but does anyone know if the Care-bears are being streamed on saturday?
<sagas> SunderlandPony89: I just think it would be funny to watch! :D

<Everlasting_Joy> |Discord|: Hahaha. . .!
<Canadian_Brony> Darg14 FlareChaser SunderlandPony89 I guess Scoot-Scootaloo was right when he said we couldn't have nice things . . .
<SunderlandPony89> Save the 4th girl to appear in a CoD game!
<HyperMetalLugia> CRT + Coax/cable = Good picture for consoles
<GilDash> FlareChaser: Aww, that's nice. Look Ninjazz|Challenge, somepony cares. :)
*MahBoi777 hugs |Discord| back
<HyperMetalLugia> CRT + AV = A bit better

<FlareChaser> GilDash: not sure if flirting or making fun of me..
<BlueFlare> 02they're SD

<Meanwhile> sagas: That explains everything.
<FlareChaser> I'm just gonna say you're a guy.
<drf|laptop> 03but people are stupid and use the crappy interlaced cables

<GilDash> CupcakeWarrior: The offer's open to everypony. ;)
<Om> GilDash: I'm afraid if all is fair in love and war, those two are one in the same. Or can be hmm?
<drf|laptop> 03it's similar to Brawl
<DuskStarshimmer> enemy gets shot, dies, you gte shot, bearly injured
<StupidSexyCJ> Quadrenaro: cool, looks good
<Ninjazz|Challenge> Dken2021: Eyup! I'm on S2 E9. Sweet and Elite.

<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777: :D
<GilDash> Om: Not quite. Love shouldn't end with dead people...
<twentypercentcooler> That's my third rage comic.
<Invi> Everlasting_Joy it's evolution. they will take over somewhen
<drf|laptop> 03as far as i know, Brawl is the only Wii game that lets you change the system's ratio from inside the game
<Ninjazz|Challenge> CupcakeWarrior: Since 24 hrs ago, I kinda took too many breaks on the account of chat and E3.
<drf|laptop> 03all the rest you have to go to system settings
<Everlasting_Joy> Invi, well, better dogs then apes in my opinion.
