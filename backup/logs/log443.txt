<Lil_B> I know thats hat what confused me
<Vordox> I bet about..1 out of 10000000 eard of it.
<Slyphoenix> Vordox: Okay then :)
<Vordox> But its a INFAMOUS movie for anime fans. =3

*GilDash catches Conyst in the act.
<DSNesmith> there's some sort of solid mass inside the photosphere that's messing up the fusion process
<Kool_Pony> creepy face
<Lil_B> so the dust on the ship... are the reminds of the people?
<RankWinner> Now you see why religious people should not be sent on this kind of mission
<DSNesmith> and they're blowing that up
<MontoyaSurge> That burned man :(
<Kandarihu> Doesn't make sense to me
<GilDash> Conyst: Oh, the things I'm tempted to do to you... ;)

*Avis coos and nuzzles nick "then get into a pokemon battle with your pokemon nick!
<Slyphoenix> Everlasting_Joy: Okay :)
*CrazyCherry hugs Bjornfot
*GilDash attempts to walk upright with CrazyCherry on the back.
<reddawn> disco space suits save the day
<Everlasting_Joy> Slyphoenix: He wouldn't be here if I didn't trust him.
<GilDash> CrazyCherry: ... Get off... :S
*Airpuff giggles at Om before pushing him over

<Svettponny> What an asshole.
<twilight_sprinkler> mama drama
<Lil_B> does he have a gun like the guy in armageddon?
<Wrek> 05good
<Michael> hai Bjornfot
*CrazyCherry kisses Bjornfot
<Wrek> 05means it will be easier for you to stop
<rotomfan63> i think the movie is about over now
<Nick> but Ran would get jealous D:
*Airpuff bows before Om "Im sorry, you are free to go"

<DSNesmith> last third of sunshine... yeah, movie over
<Bjornfot> HEY GUYS, #PonyRP
<Dark_Horst> fuck yeah, freespacing"
<Slyphoenix> Is this about 105 min long or so?
<Kool_Pony> thats really cold
<SirGanjalf> -273C
<Bjornfot> go there so we don't risk breaking some rules and upsetting people
<Avis> Pfft let Ran get Jelly
<twilight_sprinkler> aw, short movie
<DSNesmith> you wouldn't feel that cold, actually
<Fattonie> I vote for the idea that doesn't result in death
<reddawn> he is the human torch he aint bothered by cold
<DSNesmith> numb, but not cold
*Om finds a corner and lays down twitching
<Kool_Pony> Fattonie: not many ideas to vote for :(
<Avis> I'm the staraptor thats too full of herself to care
<Lil_B> yes, Space is, by definition 0K
<red_ony> The low temperature of space would not actually cause astronauts to freeze after a few seconds without space suits, as there is no medium to absorb their body heat. (wikipedia)
*Airpuff gives Om a cookie "Sorry"
*ACS13123 comforts Om "its gonna be ok..."
<SirGanjalf> Isn't that absolut zero already?
<panda> Om: dont feel so down, i still love you
<FnF> Cold doesn't matter if there's nothing for your body heat to diffuse into
<rotomfan63> oooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaak i am back mofos
<kirzstryfe> 1,3well, 1: shouldn't advertise other channels, and 2: cut it out with the RP in here
<Colder> hi guys
<Airpuff> what how many Kelvin?
<Insert_cupcake> its survivable a shor while
<DSNesmith> poor searle
<DSNesmith> I like Searle
<Om> panda: Thats what I'm afraid of >>
<Wrek> 050kelvin in spaic
*Conyst gives Om a muffin "sorry about that"
<Insert_cupcake> not quite 0 a little above
<GilDash> Om: It's alright. They should back off now. :)
<Wrek> 05well yeah
<Sharakan> dont they still need trees and stuff for oxygen?
*panda hugs Om "you want some soda?"
<Airpuff> ah.. thats cold...
<Michael> hai Colder
<DSNesmith> on AVERAGE it's slightly higher than 0, but realistically it's 0
<DSNesmith> because there's nothing there to HAVE temperature
<Kandarihu> Well, they're close to a star, so even behind a shield or a planet, it's not going to be 0 kelvin.
<Om> Pleas no more physical contact...
<pony_6500> It's about 4 degrees above
<VioletGreySha> i want such a damn suite
<rotomfan63> i'll take some soda
<twilight_sprinkler> DSNesmith: there is
<Insert_cupcake> not that a few kelvin makes a difference anyway
<pony_6500> I think
<twilight_sprinkler> DSNesmith: very few molecules, but there are
<DSNesmith> there is a very, very small amount of matter
<reddawn> this part
<Nick> but Ran can go super saiyin
<Nick> right ran?
<RaveBrony> Hey everypony!! Whatre we watching? :)
<Colder> movie?
<Magical_pablez94> i'm finally back
*GilDash hugs Om.
<rotomfan63> ^
<lollerguy> SPAAAAAAACEEE
<DSNesmith> now as someone said, of course, they're not in deep space
<Michael> hai RaveBrony
<GilDash> Om: No more after this. :)
<Kandarihu> RaveBrony: Sunshine
<SirGanjalf> DSNesmith: Well, technically space vacuum isn't an absolute vacuum, but yeah
<twilight_sprinkler> RankWinner: sunshine sunshine ladybugs awake
<Dark_Horst> freeclimbing? that's for wusses. try freeSPACING
<Slyphoenix> RaveBrony: Hi! We are watching Sunshine
<MontoyaSurge> :O
<Dark_Horst> he lost something
<Om> GilDash: ......fine......Pinkie primse
<Vordox> Nice sa...oh fu

<Wrek> 05no depreassurizing? bye bye eardrums
<DSNesmith> bye harvey
<SirGanjalf> ded
<reddawn> he is chilling
<GilDash> Om: Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a cupcake in my eye.
<twilight_sprinkler> so what happened anyway, where are they
<Lil_B> Temperature=atomic movement of matter, there is close too 0 matter in space, ergo there isn't any matter they even could move, so space is by definition total zero
<Sharakan> which one was harvey?
<twilight_sprinkler> i kinda missed a part
<RaveBrony> O.o
<DSNesmith> ouch, dat represurrization
<Ran> 2Of course
<MontoyaSurge> Harvey is ded D:
<rotomfan63> so after this movie there will be no more chat utill the next steam
<Om> GilDash: Alright no more for now >.> I'll belive you.
<twilight_sprinkler> Lil_B: no, its not 0. its a bit above it.
<Airpuff> GilDash: Did you really just do that? o.o
<rotomfan63> right?
<DSNesmith> now realistically his eyes would boil
<Ray> 02Not with me right aside :<
<Ran> 2I've got the hair and everything :D
<Vordox> >.> Erm....That's...not how space works...right?
<Avis> not better super super speed
<Wrek> 05twilight_sprinkler: if you're not goign to pay attention to the movie I have no lust to recapp whats been goign on
<Airpuff> .. Ehm..
<Ray> 02Right? :<
<rotomfan63> spaaaaaaaaaaaaace
<Airpuff> was his face unprotected?......
<Magical_pablez94> i'm finally back bronies!
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Svettponny> Ouch
<twilight_sprinkler> Wrek: hmmmm, or maybe i was gone, no?
<Marx> Ow.
<Svettponny> That must hurt
<Colder> god
*Avis pfts and crosses wings
<Kool_Pony> oh shit that looks horrible! :(
<MontoyaSurge> AGH FREEZEBURN
<Deadlypon3> Ouchies!
<Ran> 2Chaos Twiiiin
<Sharakan> damn
<RaveBrony> Dat freeze
<SirGanjalf> dem eyes
<Vordox> Fun fact. Space ain't THAT cold. :P
<Colder> fancy suit
<Sylandest> I'm back again. Was I missed?
<Airpuff> At 0 kelvin. i mean..
<Dark_Horst> fancy suit
<Vordox> Well sure it's cold cold, but...Err.
<Airpuff> he would freeze instantly
<Ray> 02Chaoz twin
<panda> That suit looks like a prob from spaceballs :D
<Om> Sylandest: Nothing.
<GilDash> Airpuff: I think Ommy was having a panic attack. How would I tease him then? ;)
<RankWinner> Who would?
<panda> prop
<Wrek> 05as stated earlier Airpuff
<Wrek> 05apparently if no medium is there to absorm his heat
<MontoyaSurge> Airpuff: he became a popsicle
<Wrek> 05he wouldnt freeze
<Marx> Instantly frozen, then instantly incinerated. Crazy way to go.
<Sylandest> Om: I was asking if I was missed...apparently not...lol
<rotomfan63> lag is not funny
<DSNesmith> also you won't "explode" in space
<panda> Sylandest: sorry but i dont know you ^^ i can miss you later lol
<Wrek> 05but yeah im not gona debate the issue since im not qualified
<DSNesmith> not enough air inside you for that kind of pressure
<Colder> explode twice in space
<rotomfan63> true
<SirGanjalf> How he get covered in ice? There's no moisture in space.
<Invi> Lil_B refering to that nowhere is perfect vacuum, and the teperature is also measured in electromagnetic radiation, you are wrong and space has a average temperature of 15°K
<reddawn> :(
<RankWinner> Things freeze because the heat (atomic movement) goes into something with less atomic movement
<Om> Sylandest: ....I knew that >>
<VioletGreySha> OH that
<Sylandest> panda: no worries, lol
<Kool_Pony> poor guy :(
<Sharakan> inb4 this guy saves them all later
<DSNesmith> your lungs will expand and your chest will distend, but you won't pop like a balloon
<RaveBrony> :o
<Sylandest> Om: uh-huh ;)
<rotomfan63> yeah your brain would clod boil
<Airpuff> Wrek ... well i gues one coul say that.. .still the vaccum would pretty much kill them instantly without a helmet xD
<RaveBrony> o____o
<Sumica> 00,10SirGanjalf the moisture in him and on him
<rotomfan63> look it up
<DSNesmith> now that's how to go out
<lollerguy> EEK
<GilDash> Sylandest: I missed you. ;)
<Sharakan> nvm
<Kandarihu> Good MOOOORNING
<Vordox> DON'T WORRY GUYS! he had sun glasses.
*RaveBrony hates that he missed the start of the movie....
<RaveBrony> :(
<Sylandest> GilDash: :D Well of course you did. You need me to balance out, lol
<rotomfan63> happy face
<panda> Vordox: well did he have sun block?

<Vordox> panda: Yeah, Sun BLock 100000000
*Avis blinks
<Fattonie> it was the synthetic
<CNreal> rfol^
<panda> xD
<Colder> that's fischer from inception?
<CNreal> rofl*
<rotomfan63> it's an over used mame
*Airpuff puts rarity's Drama-couch beside Om and puts him atop of it. Now. Feel free to go dramamode.
<Slyphoenix> Colder: I think so yes
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkler ok, space itself is ~00000000001K, your body will not drop that much heat actually, becasue there also isn't much matter to which your temperature could get transported to, + the energy coming from the sun will heat your body up a bit, the problem i see is that your body will explode inside of space
<SirGanjalf> Colder: Yup, and Scarecrow from Batman
<panda> Vordox: where the hell do they sell SPF 100 billion? I WANT!!!!
<FlareChaser> F***
<GilDash> Sylandest: No, I need Om to balance out. I need *you* to bounce suggestiveness off. ;)
<GilDash> Airpuff: Play nice with Om! :|
<Vordox> I agree with LiLb
<FlareChaser> F***ING WHY? JUST...GOD...why?
<Vordox> panda: Bad idea :P
<Sylandest> GilDash: haha, true. I am the innocent one here, or so I tell myself
<RaveBrony> Hey FlareChaser!
<panda> Vordox: hm? how come?
<GilDash> Sylandest: Yeah, right. ;)
<DSNesmith> Mace is my favorite character in this movie
<Ran> 2I've never understood why people are so blalghghg'd out by the Lavender theme
<Airpuff> twilight_sprinkler: the vaccum would kill them no matter what
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: Hey :|
<RaveBrony> Whats wrong?
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Vordox> panda: Why would yo uneed it? XD
<twilight_sprinkler> Lil_B: makes sense. i only said that the the temperature of space isnt 0. i dont know the density of matter in space to say about him losing heat or not
<Invi> Lil_B temperature can be transportet by microwaves for example
<Insert_cupcake> you can survive in space a very short while
<Airpuff> GilDash: i gave him a sofa?! Isnt taht good enough for ya! xD
<Om> Airpuff: I'm not dramatic. I just don't enjoy all that, touchy hulabaloo!
<Sylandest> GilDash: Well, I am! :P
<panda> Vordox: XD
<rotomfan63> hello jello faces
<Colder> i love space movies
<rotomfan63> >:D
<Magical_pablez94> dat mozilla crashing :D
<SirGanjalf> Airpuff: Not instantly
<twilight_sprinkler> Airpuff: ik, i never denied it. all i said was that space temp isnt 0
<rotomfan63> spaaace
<VioletGreySha> kill him
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: pic done yet? :P
<otakon> brb need a drink
<MontoyaSurge> Well they're fucked.
<Airpuff> SirGanjalf, but the amout of time that they we're in space would be enough i think
<Soupjuice> cue shed music
<Sumica> 00,10kill em any ways
<twilight_sprinkler> kill her too
<Soupjuice> erm, gunnaeatchabrains
<Michael> brb
<RaveBrony> FlareChaser: Not quite.... i may have to tweak some things.... I drew your OC in the wrong spot on the 2nd piece of paper....
<Sharakan> Kill her instead
<Lil_B> Invi ok i can only state what i leared so far, maybe my teacher simplified it. I'm gonna check it later maybe, i like sience XD
<FlareChaser> RaveBrony: ah, okay....
<panda> Kill everyone and say you did it for science :D
<RaveBrony> :\
<Conyst> The needs of the many outway the needs of the few or the one.
<RaveBrony> sorry
<Fattonie> out the airlock with him
<FlareChaser> (fuuuuuuFUUUUFFUUUUUU!!!!)
<twilight_sprinkler> panda: like Glados?

<Sumica> 00,10sonic scalple? wtf
<Kool_Pony> oh wow

<Insert_cupcake> problem solved

<Meanwhile> He doesn't look so good.
<rotomfan63> i like blood
<Invi> remembers me of a star wars vibro knife
*CrazyCherry hugs Magical_pablez94
<Deadlypon3> Well he was a happy bloke :P
<Lil_B> Invi so far I'm more the space-time theories kind of guy, i read "The Briefest history of time" by stefen hawkins XD
<MontoyaSurge> He already offed himself!
<Om> Must be his time of the month.
<Slyphoenix> SirGanjalf: Almost the same suicidal mission from Mass Effect 2?
<DSNesmith> and now the movie dives off the deep end
<Michael> lol
*Magical_pablez94 hugs CrazyCherry back
<Kandarihu> Well, they have all the oxygen they need.

*CrazyCherry kisses Magical_pablez94 on the cheek
<twilight_sprinkler> and then kill her cuz she didnt vote!
<Sharakan> AIDS
<Invi> Lil_B I wanted to read that too, my father has the book. but I am reading ''the universe in a nutshell'' atm ^^
<RaveBrony> Chicks dont give a fuck
<VioletGreySha> i gues they where thinking "why hes calling us how he killed him"
<DSNesmith> and this is why you need a psychologist on board
<rotomfan63> i like blood (slurp)
<Kool_Pony> way to waste oxygen
<rotomfan63> jk
<Lil_B> Invi it'
<Kankan> Wait, the guy who brought up diverting the mission is blaming it on the guy who didn't want anything to do with the choice? What a jerk.
<Fattonie> captain america versus scarecrow
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<Sumica> 00,10DSNesmith they had one

<Dark_Horst> i call him beef mcbacon
<DSNesmith> there is a manual mode
<Invi> twilight_sprinkler <3 chemistry is like programming the real world ^^
<DSNesmith> he's doing it right now
<reddawn> the human torch vs coolant
<twilight_sprinkler> Invi: O_o thats an interesting comparison
<Kandarihu> reddawn: lol
<Marx> Like not having a remote detonator for Sector 0 in Other M?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah makes less sence to require you to be in the tank to manualy move it
<RaveBrony> Damn exceeded budgets
<RaveBrony> :D
<Dark_Horst> i like how they make us hear that the liquid is cold as fuck
<DSNesmith> "um, mr. director, um, I think there's a problem with the film equipment"

<DSNesmith> "no it's fine, we'll just say it's intentional"
<twilight_sprinkler> which one of their crew?
<Fattonie> now he has it dumby
<Svettponny> Vaseline overload
<Sharakan> some sort of religious nut
<MontoyaSurge> Ha, she got him!
<red_ony> ...stop with the silly effect already :(
<Wrek> 05the creepy guy apparently survived 7 years on the other ship

<Lil_B> Invi i would love to be able to write computer programms, i think i even have enough spare time to learn it, but i don't thrust these online tutorials, i need a humon to teaches me it, and i will only be able to find such a curse in a bigger city
<FlareChaser|TF2> Yup, its that time to play.
<FlareChaser|TF2> TF2.
<Giger4444> I love what they say throughout the movie "We are nothing, but stardust."
<Sumica> 00,10cause wrek only kicked you, I am sure the next will be a ban
<RaveBrony> FlareChaser|TF2: Have fun :D
<RaveBrony> AW hell
<Invi> Lil_B i found a good tutorial for C++ on the internet ^^
<FlareChaser|TF2> RaveBrony: Alright, you too! :D
<otakon> Giger4444: we should watch that movie
<Giger4444> Its also an "astounding fact" according to Neil deGrasse
<Sumica> 00,10swing for the fences
<RustyMeat> death by cold water
<RaveBrony> FlareChaser|TF2: I shall!
<Colder> carl sagan always said: "we are star stuff"
<Fattonie> is that a tuning fork?
<otakon> RustyMeat: death by coolant
<Blazang> hypothermia
<DSNesmith> yes, fun fact, you are the product of thousands of dead suns
<Meanwhile> So what's even going on in this film right now
<the_real_pony_1604> pickle fork
<otakon> prince-dari: NO DAMMIT NO
<Invi> Lil_B oh, actually, it is only C
<RaveBrony> D:
<Wrek> 05he's tryign to get the mainframe back in its coolat

<Wrek> 05Meanwhile
<Blazang> the whole MR Vaselin thing ruins the movie
<Meanwhile> I see. Thanks Wrek.
<otakon> Mr. Vaselin
<DSNesmith> yes, vaseline-man was where it all went downhill
<Giger4444> Love the Kenny suit :D
<Sumica> 00,10hell of a torch
<otakon> DSNesmith: he went nuts
<RaveBrony> o.o
<Dark_Horst> yeah. bacon man kinda fucks the plausibility
<twilight_sprinkler> so its Fischer jr. vs Lord Vaselin
<otakon> oh shit
<Blazang> it's not so bad is it the relidous theme that takes over the movie
<Blazang> *religious
<VioletGreySha> time to blow that thing up
<Lil_B> Invi yes, but i think another thing is I'm too lazy, I have soo freaking much spare time to learn all the stuff i want, music, programming, physic, chemistry, but without a proper teacher and only plain text tutorial i never gonna make it :(, but thanks for the help
<Nyria> That suit reminds me of a Krogan~
<Sumica> 00,10this reminds me of a dr who ep.
<Insert_cupcake> do EVA suits have any armour?
<DSNesmith> yeah, the theme would have worked better if they hadn't introduced it an hour and a half into the movie
<Meanwhile> Sumica: "BURN WITH ME" ?
<otakon> prince-dari: NO DAMMIT NO
<Invi> Lil_B i know that feel bro /)
<Giger4444> Blazang: for me it was the shots of space. It made me feel really small.
<DSNesmith> it's not really religious though, despite pinbacker's ranting
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Insert_cupcake: not really
<Lil_B> Invi \)
<DSNesmith> it's destiny vs. fighting for your future
<Sumica> 00,10yes Meanwhile

<Kool_Pony> spam to da max :P i shall watch then!
<AwsomeNick> Big daddy?
<Blazang> Giger4444 the shots of space we're great and I loved the scenes with the sun. I just wish this film didnt turn into a slasher film at the end with religious overtones
<Meanwhile> Clap your hooves and do a little shake.
<TheRainbowDash> What the hay....:P
<KingQBall> DAMN IT I MISSED PRINCESS BRIDE!
<TheRainbowDash> I am frozen man.
<Sumica> 00,10I was frozen today.
<twilight_sprinkler> ^
<Giger4444> reddawn: you are right, but the captain thinks its God's will to extermeniate humanity and he is God's tool to fulfill that prophecy
<reddawn> its not relogious at all lol
<RaveBrony> :D
<VioletGreySha> hay TheRainbowDash
<Dark_Horst> really liking the camera perspectives
<Meanwhile> Actually no
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey Meanwhile i need to ask, did you see wrek's new pic ?
<Meanwhile> They changed the order, for some reason.
<Michael> hai TheRainbowDash

<DSNesmith> the direction in this movie is fantastic everywhere EXCEPT vaseline boy
<Deadlypon3> He has handled being frozen before ::p
<Sumica> 00,10it's like 2001 x jason in space
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Lapdance edition? Yeah I saw it.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not sure if the same pic so
<Meanwhile> I liked Moon.
<twilight_sprinkler> and all they wanted to was help
<DSNesmith> payload is free
<Colder> Meanwhile: Yeah! It's really one of my favorites sci-fi films.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No dari! I liked it!

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'll link you anyway http://i.imgur.com/rXXwp.jpg
<Sumica> 00,10epic piano is epic
<twilight_sprinkler> Moral of the story:dont stop to help others stranded in space
<Svettponny> Where's this music from? Is it really an OST? I recognize is to well.
<Lil_B> does the Blueteam have to stop the payload?
<Kandarihu> Well, religion is nothing more than man trying to connect with God on man's own terms. So surely, in this scenario, God smiles on the crew and NOT on the only one who mentions God.
<Insert_cupcake> Moon got how to make space feel lonely
<DSNesmith> they didn't stop to help them
<Svettponny> I can literally sing along.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03NO DARI I LOVE YOU!

<flutter_spin> two babes with swords... anything else you need?
<alexxm> is there any context to the random fight scene
<DuskStarshimmer> dafaq is going on
<SirPeckerish> A film. I think

<Meanwhile> The dead one looks like a really advanced version of the chick from My Life as a Teenage Robot.
<Sumica> 00,10Sorry I am already evil, dont have room for more.
<Ghosties> 04Cheeky
<otakon> so THIS is black rock shooter?

<Michael> brb
<Airpuff> =o
<AlienWarhead> daaaaawwww
<Meanwhile> Doc knocker.
<Kandarihu> ZetaMetroidBrony: anime tends to make sense when you're through the story. Context is important.
<PONY> Sumica, well, I'm chaotic neutral to be more specific.
<LittleBrony> This is a movie called Sunshine...
<Airpuff> I wish i could be that happy in the mornings...
<Ouroboros> This is Blackrock Shooter (I think) one of the movies

<Golakka> http://images.4chan.org/k/src/1337377203991.jpg
<ScootaChicken> It wasn't terrifying like the other one was.
<GilDash> PONY: You mean you do it on purpose. Poor kitten. :'(
<StreamViewer> Something tells me that's CGI.
<Golakka> What the hell is that used for>?
<Kandarihu> School Uniforms in Japan are considered fashionable, but not nearly as much as the School Swimsuits.

<otakon> Golakka: more like the Hulk of leaf blowers
<Kandarihu> AlienWarhead: it's called an R rated opening. A story that starts normal and eventually gets violent will start with violence to warn the way that things are gonna get rough.
<prince-dari> ScootaChicken: I'm serious when I have to be. :P
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Saturn...ok then....

<flutter_spin> Can't read... must pay.... can't ... uggghh
<otakon> LittleBrony: tomorrow, no ponies for now.

<LittleBrony> otakon: Then I shall sit here and wait for as long as I need to
<Bjornfot> EGGFACE IS BEST FACE
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I heard September but idk if it's true
<flutter_spin> Have the school blow up or something
*SunderlandPony89 is defeated
<LunaTheBeloved> *Capture troll*
<flutter_spin> That would get my attention
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey! Math is awesome.
*PonySwagg sports a frowy face.
*LittleBrony starts to sit
<otakon> LittleBrony: you're gonna be waiting awhile then
<AlienWarhead> I can't believe it
<Meanwhile> Bjornfot: That gets scary the longer I look at it.
<LunaTheBeloved> Congrats, Would you like to choose a nick for your troll?
<CriticKitten> ....dat hai
<PonySwagg> Gildash is gone~!
<CriticKitten> *hair
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Math is OK tier IMO
<SirPeckerish> I don't see the relevence of her.
<Bjornfot> Oh Meanwhile, you so crazy.
<Aegis3423> i love how in annime background people arent moving
<flutter_spin> This is Chess!
<LunaTheBeloved> And thus, Dari was born
<Saturn> 08,01if any of you are in the UK, and are interested in rearing beautiful moths and butterflies, pm me and I can give you some links to where you can get them
<Meanwhile> :3
<Saturn> 08,01and some tips on how
<otakon> Aegis3423: it happens at times
<Sumica> 00,10very dot hack feel so far
<GilDash> PonySwagg: I'm here in spirit. I'm entertaining right now. ;)
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: Explain to me the practicality of her wearning almost nothing to a battle
<CriticKitten> How do you even prepare that hair style, I wonder
<LunaTheBeloved> Or so I think
<junh1024-XD> Angel_Umbreon why do you liek Hchi Kochi?
<Meanwhile> Saturn: Do you know anything about tarantulas?
<AlienWarhead> lolwat
<flutter_spin> totally want to see .hack//sign
<Silverscreen> 1,11Damn. Serious mecha.
<Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: not much, actually
<LunaTheBeloved> He may have just wandered in I dunno
<otakon> the HELL was that?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> SunderlandPony89: magic
<PonySwagg> GilDash: Ah, there you are. ^^
<PrincessLuna> bugs freak me out :$
<Irish_Pony|Blind> GilDash entertaining in what way ;)
<Meanwhile> Then I'll manage.
<Sumica> 00,10I have them flutter_spin
<Saturn> 08,01but i do know a bit about them
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: mobility
<Ghosties> 04You're...pretty good! *hand gestures*
<SunderlandPony89> 'bout as goood as an answer as we're gonna get RX-78-SweetieBot
<PonySwagg> PrincessLuna sighted.
<flutter_spin> heh. Maybe another time.
<derpy_pony> didn't see the start. what did I miss so far?
<AlienWarhead> Social link GO
<CriticKitten> otakon: Um....a robotic catgirl with giant Freezing-style gauntlets?
<Airpuff> This anime is pretty cute..
<flutter_spin> I haven't seen them in a LONG time
<Silverscreen> 1,11Spandex Shorts. Molestia approves.
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: that and nothing for the enemy to grab onto to hold you still
<PrincessLuna> PonySwagg: :O
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: Why no clothes though?
<Aegis3423> lol
<flutter_spin> I think they were on Toonami? or Cartoon Network? for awhile
<GilDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: Oh you know, the usual. ;)
<PonySwagg> I am skipping too much.
<otakon> CriticKitten: and the robot tail
<red_ony> i wonder if it is forbidden to show over knee length skirts in anime oO
<Bronysith|Diablo3> and i am back from slaughtering hellspawns
<Irish_Pony|Blind> PonySwagg you have permission to sink!
<SirPeckerish> Lessbian.
<flutter_spin> too much Pinkie
<GilDash> PONY: StreamViewer has a question or two to asky you about me. :)
<otakon> PonySwagg: clear you cache, refresh
<Bjornfot> dat yuri
<Ghosties> 04Too much moe
<Bronysith> diablo 3 is so good
<CriticKitten> otakon: That was covered by "robotic catgirl"
<Ghosties> 04Too
<StinkomanFan> It's like a movie version of Persona
<Ghosties> 04Much
<PonySwagg> This. Is. Cute.
<Ghosties> 04Moe
<StreamViewer> ... Because that's how people usually act together.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> At least in episode 9 of Aquarion EVOL they actually had a magic that made it so less clothes = better dodging
<otakon> CriticKitten: oh
<PONY> GilDash, what's the question?
<Vordox> BlackRock Shooter comes from the Personal design of one person made for Miku, which became a "side character" of Miku with her own personality. And...here we are. EFFORT
<Crippler> it's FOOTBALL
<Airpuff> PonySwagg: very cute >.<
<AlienWarhead> Soccer?
<otakon> Ghosties: NEVER TOO MUCH MOE!
<Aegis3423> lol
<EggWhite> I believe the genre is shoujo-ai, could be wrong.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> GilDash Be sure to..."entertain" me later ;)
<reddawn> vollyball
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and at the end of the episode they said to never use it again
<Bronysith> LunaTheBeloved: i think i forgot to ttell you that i put up a new chapter
<StinkomanFan> >Become naked
<flutter_spin> needs more explosions!
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: no idea
<StinkomanFan> >INVINCIBLE
<flutter_spin> I can't stand the cuteness
<GilDash> PONY: Explain to him who I am. :)
<Soital> 12Its a good anime dood
<Sumica> 00,10it's time to dual
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I agree with Ghosties
<CriticKitten> I'm going to start having trouble telling the girls apart. They all have black hair in fairly ordinary styles, except for the goth chick here.
<Cipher> 0,14I can finally sit down
<Crippler> dat hair
<Meanwhile> God I hate everything in a very passive way right now.
<PonySwagg> Dat scythe
<PONY> Irish_Pony|Blind ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh how I love the eyes...
<Cipher> 0,14and not worry about doing other things
<Silverscreen> 1,11I hate anime.
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: And that MASSIVE cape. Pretty easy to grab hold of that
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Ghosties lol now ya got me imagining Travis from NMH lookin at us saying "...moe!" lol
<GilDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: Perhaps not tonight... Depends how long my entertainment lasts. :)
<Aegis3423> i dont get why she have to wear bikinis lol
<Murky> Just got on, how far in are we?
<otakon> so, I'm guessing she's Death?
<panda> Silverscreen: you do? :(
<Irish_Pony|Blind> PONY not in the way you think...;)
<Aegis3423> oh well typical anime
<StreamViewer> Her eyes are wifi symbols!
<Ghosties> 04Not just Travis, but what's herf face too
<otakon> OH COME ON!
<Meanwhile> Herf face.
<otakon> DAMN YOU BUFFER!
<Crippler> huh, I didn't know Skullgirls had a show.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Yep. Not because it's bad or anything, but because the moment you miss one episode or one scene, you're completely f*cking lost on the entire story.
<Vordox> otakon: You missed the dual :P
<StinkomanFan> Meanwhile, don't you hate everything already?
<Meanwhile> otakon is buffering forever.
<panda> Crippler: it does????????
<Cipher> 0,14Shinobu, Ghosties?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> what anime/movie is this ?
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<otakon> ITS A CHARACTER DESIGN FUCKING DEAL WITH IT

<Cipher> 0,14black rock shooter
<SunderlandPony89> Meanwhile: Besides Trixie of course
<Meanwhile> Yeah but usually only in jestful manner.
<CriticKitten> Silverscreen: That just makes it easier to mock.
<panda> Silverscreen: hehe i know you what you mean ^^
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> hows it going?
<Kandarihu> Oh, Silverscreen. I know what you're talking about.
<Sumica> 00,10this is realy bouncing back and forth too much
<Meanwhile> Or because I just dislike whatever the topic is.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> GilDash well ill just save this whiskey for later then ;)
<Crippler> no...., but that chick sorta...nevermind
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: BUT IT'S OBVIOUS FANSERVICE
<otakon> jesus christ I'm tired of defending character design decisions and being asked WHY it's that way.
<flutter_spin> needs more pacing .. heh heh
<CriticKitten> It's pretty much my second job, mocking anime when I don't get what's going on. :P
<otakon> SunderlandPony89: SHE'S GOT NO TITS OR ASS.
<GilDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: Ring Spitfire up as well. ;)
<RX-78-SweetieBot> SunderlandPony89: this really isnt very fanservice-y
*Ghosties owns both No More Heroes games
<PrincessLuna> Back
<Murky> #fluttershy
<Crippler> dat sky
<Meanwhile> I like rain, and I like snow. And I like walking in both. I like chocolate. I like the colours pink and blue. I like a bunch of stuff. But right now I just kinda loath everything.
<PonySwagg> Oh man.
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: And thank GOD for that!
<Irish_Pony|Blind> GilDash god i love being Irish....
<otakon> It's how they designed the character for christ sake.
<flutter_spin> I'm getting a Kingdom Hearts vibe now
<Ghosties> 04So
<PonySwagg> ...FITE
<Ghosties> 04Is this like
<Cipher> 0,14hoodie cape is best cape
<otakon> I STILL don't know what's going on.
<Meanwhile> kirzstryfe: Was it you who asked for some colours the other day?
<Silverscreen> 1,11DBZ, Pokemon, Yu-ghi-oh, Full Metal Alchemist, ect. I tried watching each of them. Missed or lost one episode and I couldn't understand anything anymore.
<Vordox> The eye :P
<GilDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: I love being me. :D
<Ghosties> 04a parellel dimension with moe driven ACTION BABE versions of the real girls?
<Aegis3423> lul
<CriticKitten> Dis music. So creative. One key being repeatedly tapped over and over.
<alexxm> hey GilDash hows your day been
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Ghosties is the PS3 ver good? i have the Wii ver but i was wonderin.
<GilDash> alexxm: Not too bad. :)
<otakon> Silverscreen: you're shitting me, FMA lost you on ONE ep? that's sad man.
<Crippler> a concrete pit is her favorite place?!?
<Cipher> 0,14why does she have a robo voice?
<SirPeckerish> yes
<Vordox> GUYS, this is a B Movie. Made by fans, for fans. Of course the quality has some flaws. :P
<junh1024-XD> !touhou
<otakon> Ghosties: from the looks of things
<ScriptBot> junh1024-XD, you are 7Yuki.
<reddawn> damn it every time you think its going to get good they cut back to these guys ...
<PrincessLuna> You know what anime is good? Cowboy bebop...awesome series
<Ghosties> 04I like the PS3 version for sure
<Kandarihu> Well, Pokemon tends to be very episodic. You must've missed a rare important episode.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> DBZ you don't really miss much but others have that effect on me as well
<junh1024-XD> hmmm
<flutter_spin> lol reddawn
<Ghosties> 04It's got extra stuff in it
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I never paid much attention the first time I saw this so I dont know either
<Silverscreen> 1,11The only show I could follow was Naruto, and that's because 75% of it was filler. :/
<AlienWarhead> We need to watch a Detah Note movie special here, the dub is good or ok, and there are alot of pony pardories of Death Note
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Ghosties: You play PS3? NO WAY! :)
<Murky> Not only that, it was mafe off of a joke from the Vocaloid fandom...
<Vordox> Silverscreen: Want Suggestions?
<alexxm> try gurren lagann Silverscreen
<otakon> Silverscreen: you should never watch ONe Piece then, miss one ep and you'll be lost
<GilDash> PrincessLuna: I want to see that. :)
<PrincessLuna> Ok, cowboy bebop and Naruto xD
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Ghosties huh cool i might pick it up when i can. :)
<flutter_spin> DBZ = filler all the time
<Crippler> Cowboy Bebop is one of the few Japanese shows I can tolerate.
<PonySwagg> ...Awww
<CriticKitten> Naruto....*shudder*
<PrincessLuna> GilDash: It's a fantastic series
<otakon> Silverscreen: Cowboy Bebop for sure.
<Ghosties> 04I think it's about 40 dollars right now
<PrincessLuna> Ok, and Neon Genesis Evangelion
<otakon> PrincessLuna: NO
<GilDash> PrincessLuna: Maybe I'll surf the net sometime for it.
<TheXIIILightning> Hey, Naruto is awesome
<OmegaMetroidBrony> You could follow Naruto Silverscreen? I missed one ep and I had no idea wtf happened
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> why do i get the feeling they are going to make out soon?
<Cipher> 0,14the singer is familiar
<otakon> DO NOT WATCH NGE!
<PONY> GilDash, I think I can't do this, I lost my focus when I started gettin PMs
<flutter_spin> too much cute
<Cipher> 0,14forgot the name
<PrincessLuna> otakon: :(
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Sorry my Skype tool bars crashed...again...
<Crippler> tee hee
<otakon> Unless you want to be depressed into oblivion
<Kandarihu> My cellphone doesn't have straps either.
<CriticKitten> PrincessLuna: You could pay full attention to NGE and still be forgiven for having no clue what the flying buck happened.
<Wrek> 05nightmare mode?
<otakon> PrincessLuna: that's a show for the mentally disturbed.
<GilDash> PONY: From whoever I told you? :D
<Wrek> 05not convinced yet
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> what is nge?
<flutter_spin> FINALLY
<PONY> GilDash, yes.
<alexxm> suddenly fight scene
*Ghosties blinks "Creepy where it froze"
<PrincessLuna> Well I loved Neon Genesis Evangelion....
<otakon> Okay, the FUCK is going on?
<Aegis3423> lol
<AlienWarhead> Is this the first time BronyState had anime on?
<PonySwagg> Rawrfite
<reddawn> nooooooo
<flutter_spin> lol
<PrincessLuna> I loved the episodes and the movies
<flutter_spin> nooooo
<Aegis3423> random fight scenes -.-
<GilDash> PONY: Well, I'm busy with other matters. ;)
<Ghosties> 04No
<Wrek> 05they still die fast and without a fight
<Cipher> 0,14eeeenope, AlienWarhead
<Kandarihu> Yesterday, I proposed watching NGE as brainbleach from The Wall.
<Ghosties> 04We've had Miyazaki on here before
<Crippler> whooooo want's a crazy montage!??
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Wrek! glad your here i was wondering if i could ask you something....
<otakon> ANIME, EXPLAIN DAMMIT!
<PonySwagg> GilDash: I bet I can guess what THOSE are
<Silverscreen> 1,11AlienWarhead: Oh, hell no.
<Ghosties> 04And I definitely count that as anime
<Meanwhile> Miyazaki week.
<flutter_spin> Its like watching two totally different animes one after another
<Meanwhile> That was fun.
<otakon> WHY DOES THE ANIME NOT EXPLAIN ITSELF!?
<Cipher> 0,14yeo
<Angel_Umbreon> 13fff
<Silverscreen> 1,11We've had anime on here since it started.
<Sumica> 00,10well it is anime Ghosties
<Angel_Umbreon> 13so much cute
<Cipher> 0,14first time I've ever seen Miyazaki films
<Vordox> It's hard to maintain dual story based on fan fiction to understand what is happening :p
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I always feel so warm and happy after watching it ;w;
<Ghosties> 04Dat :3 face
<otakon> Vordox: wait..........what?
<PonySwagg> GIMME XD
<GilDash> PonySwagg: You've got no idea. It's hard to entertain this many ponies.
<CriticKitten> KITTYFAEC. :3
<reddawn> i dont want school i want 2 chicks fighing in skimpy outfits
<flutter_spin> What was that weird one you showed awhile back? Dubstopper? can't remember the name of it
<TheXIIILightning> No!!! More school!
<Ghosties> 04Your face when
<Ghosties> 04I actually prefer
<Kandarihu> In the dark world. One of the girls who was fighting has the same hairstyle as Yomi. That's significant.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Thanks for the suggestions. :) It doesn't help that most animes follow their own form of logic and universe and requires full understanding of both to follow along. The closest thing to an anime I could follow the whole way through was Avatar, TLA.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> xD
<PrincessLuna> Anyway I'm going to shower then see if walmart has any boxes, so I'll be back later
<TheXIIILightning> Look, it's anime Spike!
<Ghosties> 04Laid back anime like this somewhat
<Sharakan> what a nice kid
<Crippler> okay, so they're BFFs or something.
<Sumica> 00,10Not gonna lie, other then looking nice I am lost as hell with this one
<RX-78-SweetieBot> oh wow, they are going through all the regular episodes a slice of life has in a montoge
<Ghosties> 04I'd rather have this over ACTION BABES
<flutter_spin> Avatar ruled
<Silverscreen> 1,11Ghosties, I can tell why.
<otakon> Sumica: same here
<Sumica> 00,10And I am the one that is supposed to like anime here
<GilDash> PrincessLuna: See you later! :)
<TheXIIILightning> Nope
<RX-78-SweetieBot> montage*
<Ghosties> 04Since, you know, action has been done before and it's been done very well
<otakon> Sumica: same friggin here...
<PonySwagg> ATLA was like, the best thing that western animation ever produced.
<CriticKitten> I like anime in general, but this has me lost in a daze.
<flutter_spin> and its ov.... wait
<otakon> bye PrincessLuna TAKE A ANTIDEPRESSANT!
<TheXIIILightning> @Sumica, anime is the next best thing after ponies
<panda> Ghosties: you like laid back anime? well what about sad anime
<CriticKitten> Oh, it's robo-catgirl again!
<Shizuka> 13isn't black rock shooter a vocaloid?
<Ghosties> 04I like "dramatic" anime
<PrincessLuna> otakon: :'(
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Sumica well i never able to follow anime...unless its a movie :P
<SirPeckerish> So confused.
<CriticKitten> NEEDS MOAR ROBO-CATGIRL.
<junh1024-XD> who r yuki.
<otakon> Shizuka: I think so
<Vordox> Dual story guys :P Keep it up, it's connected.
<Kandarihu> Silverscreen: Avatar is western
<Kokonoe> no, black rock shooter isn't a vocaloid
<Ghosties> 04And most times "dramatic" anime has action in it
<kirzstryfe> 1,3the 2 storylines makes it a little hard to follow, but it comes together near the end
<Vordox> It's like one of those "Final punch lines" things.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Walk it off
<Angel_Umbreon> 13I don't know :B
<Murky> Black Rock Shooter came out of Vocaloid, so somewhat.
<Cipher> 0,14I thiiiink so, Shizuka
<otakon> PrincessLuna: you like NGE, you clearly are suffering from issues
<reddawn> is that the coach?
<TheXIIILightning> @Irish, try watching "Sword of the Stranger"
<Crippler> deal with it!
<Vordox> What kirzstryfe said
<CriticKitten> dealwithit.jpg
<Ghosties> 04So stuff like Outlaw Star, Trigun, and the ever best Cowboy Bebop
<flutter_spin> I hope so kirz
<Sumica> 00,10this might call for some specal anime after this
<AlienWarhead> SilverScreen just do what like and try new things when you want to or get bored, btw Avatar is awesome<3
<GabeMoist> Ghosties, you like laid back anime, have you seen Mushishi?
<otakon> Sumica: yay!
<panda> Ghosties, I should recomend clannad :D
<Silverscreen> 1,11PonySwagg: Indeed. And I was severely pissed at how they butchered it in the Live Action Movie.
<PrincessLuna> otakon: That wasnt the discussion topic :[
<Blowdown> hello everyone
<CriticKitten> Cowboy Bebop is wonderful. :3
<Kokonoe> Black Rock Shooter is just a character that appeared on a Vocaloid song
<Vordox> Sumica: I have a vote we can watch. :P If I can request a movie XD
<PrincessLuna> CriticKitten: I <3 you
<Cipher> 0,14>Kokonoe
<PonySwagg> ATLA is why I watch Korra
<otakon> PrincessLuna: I'm only messing with you :P
<OmegaMetroidBrony> I sprained my ankle in the beggining of the school day delt with it and walked over a mile on it
<Cipher> 0,14OH GOD
<PonySwagg> And so far they haven't gone wrong
<Cipher> 0,14OUR GIGANTIC TAGERS ARE NOT SAFE
<RAWRity> Bonjour
<Ghosties> 04I have not seen Mushishi
<Kokonoe> oH MAN

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Hola RAWRity
<otakon> hiya RAWRity
<Irish_Pony|Blind> PrincessLuna oh dont mind otokan...we just all love to rape him ;)
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Mushishi was a good one
<Vordox> This anime will have you dropping your jaw. :P Atleast five times.
<reddawn> the coach looks as old as the kids
<Kandarihu> When watching anime, it helps to not be too obsessed with logic. Just suspend your disbelief or go back to sitcoms.
<Nick> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Nick, you are a Hippowdon.
<Crippler> ACE
<Nick> .-.
<flutter_spin> 1 hour, you say?

<Sumica> 00,10you are welcome to sujest but I have somthing in mind already
<PONY> GilDash, I think i got this.
<reddawn> what was the point in the scene change?
<Kokonoe> It's funny how Black Rock Shooter was just an character of a vocaloid song, then they made an ova, and then it's own anime
<GilDash> PONY: Got what now?
<ACS13123> PonySwagg: what ponies?
<PonySwagg> This... this is somehow sad.
<Ghosties> 04Speaking of anime
<TheXIIILightning> Oh god, they're lesbians right?
<Crippler> sooo sad
<Ghosties> 04When I do stream
<Irish_Pony|Blind> NOW KISS DAMN IT!

<RAWRity> Ghosties: YES PLEASE.
<Kandarihu> Okay. I crossed the line there. I'm sorry.
<GilDash> DAMNIT! Lesbians on screen and my stream fucks up. :(
<Meanwhile> I don't think they're anything other than best friends atm.
<Murky> In the vein of pointless suggestions, Stream all of Madoka Magica in a row.
<TheXIIILightning> I can smell the sexual tension XD
<Sumica> 00,10I am ok with lain
<GilDash> PONY: Whatever do you mean?
<RAWRity> Ghosties: LAIN IS MY NUMBER ONE FAV ANIMES.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Cipher Tail lady is always grumpy and does not share her candies :p
<the_real_pony_1604> did someone say LAIN!!?!?!
<flutter_spin> Ghost in the Shell works too

<RAWRity> Seriously, LAIN IS AMAZING.
<TheXIIILightning> btw, I need to learn how to do those *ding* messages
<PonySwagg> PONY: See? Ponies.
<Ghosties> 04It's certainly a "creepy" sort of anime, but it's much more than that
<Silverscreen> 1,11otakon: Oh yeah, it's absolutely hilarious how Goku is slowly snapping Frieza's mind.
<CriticKitten> Silverscreen: Hahaha, I love that abridged series.
<otakon> I love DBZ Abridged, we should show the WHOLE series.
<Espeon> !pokemon
<Silverscreen> 1,11And episode 30 is meant to be finished by the end of the month.
<ScriptBot> Espeon, you are a Tyrogue.
<Meanwhile> My chat is deeeeeaaaaaaaaad.
<RAWRity> Ghosties: Lain is fucking fantastic.
<otakon> Silverscreen: "How you you function?"
<TheXIIILightning> YES! DBZ Abridged!
<Ghosties> 04I agree, RAWRity
<otakon> not it's not
<flutter_spin> Lain toys with your mind with logic and reason. I love it.
<TheXIIILightning> Muffin Button!
<otakon> it's just "mostly" dead
<TheXIIILightning> :P
<RAWRity> Ghosties: have you seen Ghost Hound?
<otakon> that mean's it's slightly alive
<Meanwhile> And that means it's slightly alive.
<Silverscreen> 1,11"...I'm going to drown you. I'm going to drown you like a sack of puppies."
<Ghosties> 04I've heard of Ghost Hound but never seen it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yes it's dead and you're a zombie otakon
<Irish_Pony|Blind> And suddenly an add for canadains want to date me appears.....

<PonySwagg> It's adorable
<AlienWarhead> Oh noes
<Crippler> Homewrecker!
<otakon> Silverscreen: "Why would you drown puppies?"
<flutter_spin> yummy
<RAWRity> I still find it hilarious that the head writer for Lain also did "Digimon Tamers"
<Kandarihu> Oh, Mato and Yomi can't hang out together anymore because they are in rival clubs.
<GilDash> PONY: So, did you manage to explain?
<SirPeckerish> Sad :(
<Silverscreen> 1,11"Because I'm evil, you moron!" (I think that's how it goes..)
<Latichu> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Latichu, you are a 12Servine.
<Ghosties> 04On that note, I definitely plan on streaming some Yume Nikki and .flow
<RRG_7> :O
<Meanwhile> My chest hurts.
<Kandarihu> Well, they're not supposed to be friends anymore.
<PonySwagg> GilDash: No one can explain you.
<otakon> Silverscreen: god I love that show.
<Sharakan> oh i c. this show is about friendship
<Roxsnow> Ghosties , I love you <3
<Starflash> ^
<Crippler> Do all Japanese schools force their students to wear skirts?
<GilDash> PonySwagg: Oh, I can think of a few good words. ;)
<Ghosties> 04Um, okay o.o
<Murky> Oh sure, no one in here was planning on sleeping for the next 72 hours. Bring on the yandere!
<Ghosties> 04Thanks hehe
<GabeMoist> Ghosties, Yume Nikki? Isn't that....?
<PONY> GilDash: http://aijaa.com/0090710216685
<flutter_spin> I'm actually surprised I haven't seen anything to keep me interested, even with the battles.
<TheXIIILightning> lol, flat face
<PonySwagg> GilDash: No one but you, of course XD
<flutter_spin> better have some awesome ending
<Ghosties> 04Yume Nikki was made by Kikiyama, an anonymous game designer from Japan

<Cipher> 0,14UBOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<GabeMoist> UBOOOOAAAAAAAA
<GilDash> PonySwagg: Oh, I'm sure you can think of a few good words too. :D
<Silverscreen> 1,11My favorite part is when Goku says something stupid, and Frieza doesn't even respond. He just barely moves as if trying to comprehend what Goku said...
<PonySwagg> Ghosties: So is that what this is called?
<Cipher> 0,14ninja'd you GabeMoist :3
<Ghosties> 04OH SHI

<flutter_spin> I turn around for 3 seconds
<Nick> omg! *hugs latichu
<otakon> okay, the HELL just happened?
<Meanwhile> And I have yet to grasp why this bit is important or relevant
<Kandarihu> Ghosties: this looks more like it's all going to start coming together.
<AlienWarhead> A cut happened
<Silverscreen> 1,11Anyone here watch Super Mario Brothers Z?
<RAWRity> ... did we just swith to Soul Eater out of the blue?
<FillyFlam> ...I just got done eating. WTF is this.
<CriticKitten> What is going on? ._.
<Meanwhile> Oh.
<Murky> Oh...
<otakon> Meanwhile: I have yet to grasp it either
<Meanwhile> This bit suddenly makes sense.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> did you take some medicine already Meanwhile ?
<junh1024-XD> yuki can maek snow?
*Ghosties slaps GabeMoist's hands away
<TheXIIILightning> Catfight!

<PonySwagg> GilDash: Most of the words I could use to describe you can't be said here.
<Meanwhile> To a degree.
<PonySwagg> ...This girl is a tank.
<GilDash> PONY: OMFG! :D
<Ghosties> 04Keep messing with the lights and bad, bad things happen >:I

<Ghosties> 04We're not in Ponoko's house! Much worse things could happen here! :O
<Vordox> Dat slim plot. :P
<CriticKitten> PLOT SHOT?
<PonySwagg> NOTHING
<Kandarihu> Silly girl, bringing a gun to a swordfight
<Silverscreen> 1,11Nopony? Nopony saw SMBZ?
<otakon> damn
<PONY> Actually... Good music
<Sumica> 00,10I saw it ages ago Silverscreen
<Meanwhile> Maybe my chest problem will come back in force and just finish me off in my sleep.
<otakon> Silverscreen: I did, good stuff
<PonySwagg> Unless the gun can be a SWORD
<flutter_spin> never heard of it
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Silverscreen: SMBZ?
<Kokonoe> I really like how it goes from School Girls and Friendship to FIGHTING AND STUFF
<TheXIIILightning> OH COME ON!!
<otakon> Silverscreen: he made a partial ep 9 finally
<Sumica> 00,10but then he got slow on the updates so i stoped careing
<CriticKitten> Okay, I have to ask because it's bugging me.
<Aegis3423> anotehr cut :/
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Silverscreen i saw it :)
<Aegis3423> i kenw it
<AlienWarhead> Silverscreen I just saw some clips on youtube
<RX-78-SweetieBot> :<
<CriticKitten> Why is that girl's eye on fire?
<Murky> Anime logic: never bring a gun to a sword fight.
<Crippler> The fighting music sorta sounds like the DOOM2 soundtrack
<SunderlandPony89> Meanwhile: Happy thoughts now...
<Welsh_Pony> Good flash movies, shame it stopped
<RAWRity> Meh, Accel World does the random fights out of nowhere better
<Silverscreen> 1,11Super Mario Brothers Z. A Mario/Sonic crossover with a DBZ format.
<otakon> OH GODDAMMIT WILL YOU JUST EXPLAIN IT ALREADY ANIME!?
<Vordox> CriticKitten: "power mode" thingie :P
<RAWRity> otakon: eenope
<otakon> Silverscreen: that kicks ASS!
<alexxm> Silverscreen have you seen gurren lagann
<Kandarihu> The mundane and the action take place in different worlds that are somehow connected.
<PonySwagg> Silverscreen: That = EPIC
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I think we made meanwhile too happy earlier so now hes being extra depressing to make up for it
<Vordox> >.> Silverscreen You mean Super Mario Z?
<flutter_spin> lol what?
<ScootaChicken> Well.
<ScootaChicken> Today's been fun.
<Conyst> I remember SMBZ years since I saw it
<otakon> PonySwagg: it's all sprite animation too
<PonySwagg> She misses her friend~
<Vordox> That blue background makes it hard to read :P
<Meanwhile> My heart won't let me be happy. Isn't that poetic.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3otakon, this is one of those rare ova's that require you to watch most of it before it reveals the point of the story
<Cipher> 0,14;__;
<RAWRity> inb4 this turns into Master of Martial Hearts
<Vordox> Alraedy seen all of it, amazing artist/Writer really.
<Meanwhile> Stupid broken failure of an organ.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2390/ Seems that Twilight got the right idea
*drfsupercenter sighs
<TheXIIILightning> Like Asura's Wrath, it's Onepice, Bleach, Naruto and Dragonball all mixed up
<PonySwagg> See, now I wanna see the rest of this
<PONY> I have an Imaginary friend
<flutter_spin> and then makes you want to rewatch it kirz?
<drfsupercenter> 03forgot to finish/turn in my Matlab assignment that was due earlier... x.x
<otakon> kirzstryfe: I've watched it, it's show ONE pertinent plot point.
<Vordox> kirzstryfe: Not all are patient to get engrossed, it's a sad fact.
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Having your eye on fire is a power mode thingie? Man, I miss the days when it was easy to tell someone had buffed up. Their eyes would light up or their hair got absurdly long and spiky or something, and they just crackled with lightning.
<Meanwhile> Just fyi, it's not broken and I'm not fatally ill.
<Aegis3423> lol
<TheXIIILightning> tak tak tak tak
<Meanwhile> It just aches a lot.
<CriticKitten> Texting: The Anime

<StreamViewer> AMBIGUOUSLY LESBIAN FRIENDS!
<PONY> Saturn, that'S called mutation
<CriticKitten> Vordox: That way I know it's meant to be badass, rather than just a weird animation choice.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Saturn WELL LETS SEE IT MAN!
<Aegis3423> lol
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Like DBZ, One Piece or Naruto? :P
<Saturn> 08,01PONY: well, yes

<Kandarihu> It's thundering near me. GOod thing there's a battery in my laptop
<GilDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: That image... I can make your mind up for you. ;)
<otakon> Saturn: ask Wrek to do it
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Lost interest in it after Chapter 300 something
<RaveBrony> Saturn: You are mod, why not just ask Wrek?
<otakon> Kandarihu: what about your router though?
<TheXIIILightning> Lol phone
<twilight_sprinkler> i cant stand dbz
<RX-78-SweetieBot> :<
<RAWRity> OOH! I know! If I ever get but in a position where I'm a mod/streamer, I'll stream: Ikki Tousen, Eiken, Master of Martial Hearts, and High School of the Dead

<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: well taht's you.
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Lucky you, you didn't have to suffer through the arrancar then.
<Kandarihu> Yeah. That's going to be a problem if it goes.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3because Wrek actually has a life and other stuff to work on
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Not to mention Kenpachi...
<ScootaChicken> Anyone, as much as I've been trolled today, it has been fun.
<Murky> Kandarihu: does however you're connected to the internet have a batterybackup too?
<otakon> RAWRity: oh dear god, so much fanservice
<flutter_spin> So let me get this straight: girl gets best friend, girl disappears... that sum it up?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> It has
<AlienWarhead> O RLY
<DocSane> マジです。何のアニメ？
<Irish_Pony|Blind> GilDash well tel me...which one is you and which one is Spitfire?
<otakon> flutter_spin: eeyup
<flutter_spin> lol ok
<DocSane> :)
<FillyFlam> Don't be silly. Having a life and ponies are mutually exclusive.
<RaveBrony> Saturn: I would draw it for you, but im not the best and im already drawing something for FlareChaser :\
<ScootaChicken> Which is good, seeing as I haven't been in the best mood lately
<Vordox> DocSane: English.^^
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: High School of the Dead? Christwagons, man, that's too much.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> :<
<DocSane> What's the anime?
<TheXIIILightning> Ow phone, you bit me!
<ScootaChicken> But I'm glad you guys have been there to cheer me up ^_^

<Vordox> DocSane: BlackRock Shooter.
<StreamViewer> ... It says... I have free bacon.
<AlienWarhead> Black Rock Shooter
<ScootaChicken> ...by violently trolling me.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: THAT is too much, but 5 fucking seasons of Ikki Tousen is fine?
<otakon> CriticKitten: that's too much? what about Eiken?
<Cipher> 0,14suddenly cool guiat
<RaveBrony> HOTD was the BEST!! Is there a season 2 anime??

<Silverscreen> 1,11Flutter_Spin: MOre like girl gets best friend, best friend turns "close" friend, "close" friend vanishes.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: I was commenting on the one I recognized.
<DocSane> Which just goes to show what an out of touch old fart I've become.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> there was no violence
<Cipher> 0,14I thought Ikki Tousen was only 4 seasons?
<Vordox> Silverscreen: Had tha tfeeling irl as well, Silver?
<AlienWarhead> I missed the text did anyone catch it?
<otakon> and then she hurts her knee
<RaveBrony> kenne: Lol!! Ikr? :D
<RaveBrony> RAWRity: Awwww D:
<ScootaChicken> Dari's banning was pretty violent.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that only works to prove that you are a masochist i guess
<flutter_spin> what does that mean? there ARE lesbians?
<Vordox> DETECTIVES.
<Kandarihu> One Piece is shonen action with epic story to it. Infectious tears too. When anyone cries, you will too.
<StreamViewer> Detectives? Her mom seems a little too happy for that...
<otakon> AlienWarhead: Call, Takashi is missing
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Haven't seen the other two, but now I know not to. >_>
<Aegis3423> XD
<flutter_spin> I never got that vibe
<ScootaChicken> Meh, I just thought it was pretty funny tbh
<TheXIIILightning> X - Lie

<Ghosties> 04Detective Phelps, LAPD
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: But does it have breasts that can defy logic and appear to function within the Matrix?
<PonySwagg> Dem Detectives
<RAWRity> and Master of Martial Hearts is what you'd get if you crossed Ikki Tousen with School Days
<AlienWarhead> You're lying

<junh1024-XD> we did this iin a class of 30? and we got two matching bdays
<flutter_spin> WUT?
<FillyFlam> I don't get it.
<Aegis3423> XD
<RRG_7> WTH
<TheXIIILightning> I am nothing like you...
*GabeMoist drops the title
<reddawn> really...
<SirPeckerish> Ok.
<Cipher> 0,14PERSONAAAAAAAAAA
<Welsh_Pony> ...Ok
<otakon> yeah, that explained NOTHING
<PonySwagg> That was kinda fun.
<SlurryMoon> 3...
<CriticKitten> That's it?
<panda> DAT ENDING :D
<StreamViewer> And then...?
<SlurryMoon> 3Was that it?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> 8.5/10
<Vordox> See, it was easy to interpret, right? :P
<Bjornfot> WAT
<Silverscreen> 1,11I'm...still confused.
<Aegis3423> XD
<otakon> SlurryMoon: I am so confused
<flutter_spin> WUT?
<reddawn> what a bad ending
<Murky> Then nothing. It's over.
<CriticKitten> That made no goddamn sense.
<CriticKitten> XD
<panda> otakon: yea there will be a series... it will explain ^^
<SirPeckerish> That was weired.
<Sharakan> What is this i dont even
<Kandarihu> I'm also confused by the ending.
<Aegis3423> oh well another normal anime for me :/
<reddawn> i am disapointed
<Kokonoe> I think the Black Rock Shooter anime makes more sense
<RX-78-SweetieBot> err
<otakon> THAT FUCKING EXPLAINED NOT A FUCKING THING!
<flutter_spin> was that some sort of prelude?
<Meanwhile> Dunno what you guys mean, I understand just fine.
<StreamViewer> There was no moral to the story..
<RX-78-SweetieBot> 8/10
<Bjornfot> SOMEPONY PLEASE FRIKKIN EXPLAIN
<Litwick> what movie did i miss?
<DocSane> God damn, I hate anime like this.
<Cipher> 0,14yeah, iirc, this OVA leads into the anime
<otakon> IT was worse the the ending to ME3
<Welsh_Pony> So....what happened to the missing girl?
<Sumica> 00,10the eps already came out for this
<EggWhite> Oh, I get it now.
<GabeMoist> burakku rokku shuutaa
<Silverscreen> 1,11That made no damn sense.
<RRG_7> this is the most weirest anime i ever seen
<DocSane> It's everything wrong with modern anime.
<StinkomanFan> TITLE DROP
<reddawn> 1/10
<PonySwagg> lol
<RRG_7> weirdest
<Aegis3423> XD
<Icy> F22skyhunter: Moro !!! xD
<RX-78-SweetieBot> needs robots to be higher than an 8
<Sharakan> harsh
<DocSane> Pretentious, badly told story.
<FillyFlam> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4520/
<panda> Sumica: they have?????
<otakon> Silverscreen: same here, I get a bit of it but goddammit not a bit of explanation for the viewer
<drfsupercenter> 03Latichu: http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/380292_10150821559528870_6278093869_9719895_1400417108_n.jpg
<RAWRity> What I've getting is, we watched the 2 halves of the story back to back.
<F22skyhunter> Icy: sup! =D
<flutter_spin> that's like something you throw out when people have seen 20 episodes of the series
<PonySwagg> FillyFlam: Dem WTF faces.
<StinkomanFan> Now I wish I actually watched it instead of reading the Coke Pony tumblr
<CriticKitten> Okay seriously, no clue what the hell just happened and I'm not sure it'd make more sense even if it had been twice as long.
<RAWRity> Basically, that "ending" was the middle part.
<AlienWarhead> Otakon you know not of what you speak nothing can top the bullshit that is the Mass effect 3 ending
<Crippler> triple AAA!!!!
<RainbowAsh> Hiya
<otakon> RAWRity: that is NOT how you end it then
<RX-78-SweetieBot> lol
<Sumica> 00,10yeah I saw them when looking for a sub of this large enough to read
<Irish_Pony|Blind> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2579/ HHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNGGGGGG
<otakon> AlienWarhead: I witnessed it, at least it explained more then THAT.
<RAWRity> otakon: no, you see, we've SEEN the ending. We just didn't KNOW it was the ending.
<TheXIIILightning> Dragonball Abridged anyone?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Oh, so they had both sides of the story playing at once. Thanks for clearing that up. I wish the fucking MOVIE CLEARED IT UP!
<Kandarihu> kirzstryfe: you are the one who requested this. Does the series make more sense of this, or is there something we need explained?
<Aegis3423> :D
<panda> Sumica: no w i have to go looking
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I've never seen the series actually
<otakon> RAWRity: the hell you say.
<RAWRity> Silverscreen: It's a movie that doesn't hand-hold is all.
<Sumica> 00,108 or so eps iirc
<PonySwagg> kirzstryfe: Neither have I
<otakon> RAWRity: the ending is at teh END not in the middle dammit.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: It's a movie that doesn't explain a damn thing, is all.
<CriticKitten> :p
<Meanwhile> Silverscreen: No offence, but it's not exactly The Count of Monte Cristo in terms of figuring things out.
<Sharakan> good music though
<twilight_sprinkler> aw its over i missed the end
<Kandarihu> Is it complete or still going onto a 12-13 episode mark?
<Ghosties> 04Animes exist to give context a reason to exist
<Om> So what I miss?
<Litwick> Also, sorry for being offline for so long, I had some freinds over.
<Ghosties> 04It's a vicious cycle ._.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Not everything should be spelled out for the viewer
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man this makes me wanna see A to Z Gaia Memory of Fate now :D
<Damos> ...have you guys gotten out of school yet?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Sketch_Toku_Brony: YES
<RAWRity> otakon: Basically, it's like if you took a movie, and cut it off at the middle point. then you put the two halfs and sperse them together.
<reddawn> the entire movie seems like a jumbled up mess
<TheXIIILightning> I feel like playing Asura's Wrath suddenly...
<otakon> Meanwhile: THEN FUCKING EXPLAIN OH GREAT MINDED INDIVIDUAL
<Kokonoe> I really liked the black rock shooter anime for no reason
<RainbowAsh> Has Wrek streamed any s2 GoT already?
<CriticKitten> Which makes it a poor movie to be honest. I've gotta say, I've seen better movies in the anime style that didn't leave me as clueless as this. >_>
<flutter_spin> I don't get it. So did she get stolen or something?
<Vordox> kirzstryfe: It was a nice attempt.
<otakon> RAWRity: that's not my job dammit, that was just incoherent
<RAWRity> All the fighting and whatnot we saw earlier was what happened AFTER she joined together with Black Rock Shooter
<AlienWarhead> Otakon I shouldn't argue, but The Mass Effect 3 ending hurt me worse than any ending I will ever witness in my lifetime
<SunderlandPony89> Oh, the movies over? What's next?
<RAWRity> otakon: it's non-linear storytelling.
<flutter_spin> My brain is still working out the details, but it leaves a lot to be desired
<RAWRity> Hell, I came in in the last 20 mins and I figured it out.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> wow, people in main chat were confused by this movie so much
<panda> AlienWarhead: no no no the ending the soul eater was by far the worst!
<Meanwhile> otakon: Sorry, even if I possessed the knowledge of how to speak on your level, I have an impairment when it comes to explanations.
<Crippler> braveheart was a good film
<Sumica> 00,10but wait there is more
<otakon> RAWRity: then you show that AFTERWARDS. They still didn't explain WHAT that worlsd was, WHY she went there.
<Meanwhile> Ikr.
<Kandarihu> Oh, stinger!
<TheXIIILightning> MORE PLOT!
<Vordox> YAY normality!
<Cipher> 0,14CREDITS SCEEEEEEENE
<otakon> Meanwhile: fuck off you pretentious prick.
<RustyMeat> wait what
<RainbowAsh> AlienWarhead, I haven't played ME at all, but the good ending doesn't seem to be so bad, actually.
<CriticKitten> What is this, a Marvel movie?
<Vordox> OH YEAH
<RustyMeat> What the fuck.
<Vordox> I forgot her
<Vordox> XD
<Meanwhile> Ah lighten up otakon, enjoy the pink section.
<TheXIIILightning> It's like the Avengers again...
<Crippler> dat hair
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I kinda want to watch the series that goes with it now
<otakon> Meanwhile: don't fucking talk down to me and defend this confusing ass anime.
<Silverscreen> 1,11So, in the end, this movie was just a cliche Love and Fight story that was told "differently" for it to appear "artsy."
<Murky> Yes?
<RRG_7> now everything explodes
<Sharakan> I DONT GET IT!
<TheXIIILightning> wut?
<PonySwagg> Well then
<Cipher> 0,14I was kinda confused too >.>
<twilight_sprinkler> Meanwhile: hes right. you do have a habit of talking down to people.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Welcome to Bronystate, you may at times be exposed to stories and movies you may not fully understand unless you pay attention. If you have issue with this, you may refer to Addendum Spiderman.mp4
<Ghosties> 04I'll tell you what's different: Lain
<Sumica> 00,10so yea that was the offical stream.
<flutter_spin> I GET IT!!!!
<CriticKitten> Okay, that scene was even more pointless than anything else.
<TheXIIILightning> Well that explains everything!!
<CriticKitten> Ever.
<Cipher> 0,14but then Rawrity explained it
<flutter_spin> Still... weird though
<Litwick> Is it Princess Bride time?
<Ghosties> 04But I'll also tell you what's AMAZING: Lain
<flutter_spin> We already watched Princess Bride
<junh1024-XD> i'm in university
<otakon> Litwick: it's over already
<Aegis3423> XD
<Litwick> GOD DAMMIT.
<Cipher> 0,14and then it made it a ton of sense
<Kandarihu> So, Mato fused with Black*Rock Shooter in order to save Yomi. And then Yomi was saved.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: It was not pointless.
<flutter_spin> lol lit
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkler: Totally untrue. Ok maybe a little true, but that's just being blunt.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> its just the movie cut in half and the halves interleaved
<Sumica> 00,10have a bit of a break whole I set somthing up
<PonySwagg> Yup, Princess Bride ended
<RAWRity> Ghosties: DAMN STRAIGHT
<PonySwagg> HEY
<Vordox> Oh cool Sumi. =3
<otakon> CriticKitten: foreshadowin if anything
<PonySwagg> HEY DERPY
<RX-78-SweetieBot> not all the complicated
<FillyFlam> Alright, lotto time
<Murky> Yeah, that was my reaction to missing Princess Bride.
<Golakka> In the intermission, Have some VNV
<Sharakan> So whats next?
<TheXIIILightning> Muffins...
<the_real_pony_1604> Live ponies again?
<Golakka> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTL8NtqGdw4
<PonySwagg> GETME SOME POPCORN
<RX-78-SweetieBot> that*
<SunderlandPony89> Iiiiinterrrrrmiiiiissssiiiooonn
<twilight_sprinkler> Meanwhile: oh well if you say so then it must be true
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Correction, it was thoroughly pointless unless you plan to watch the anime apparently.
<Sumica> 00,10oh you want that while I grab chow? oki
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Cipher: who picked that movie?
<AlienWarhead> Mass Effect 3 is the worst ending for me and I know there are other bad endings, it is just the Mass Effect 3 was really very extremely bad in my opinion
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Ever heard of CLiff HAngerS?
<CriticKitten> Which I can't say I do, now. O.o
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkler: Do you WANT me to talk down to you?
<Sumica> 00,10back in a moment
<Cipher> 0,14kirz did
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ah
<flutter_spin> that was short.... NOOOOOO

<CriticKitten> >_>
<Aegis3423> noooo
<RustyMeat> Oh jesus
<Aegis3423> lol
<RAWRity> BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: it was confusing, plain and simple. It's like dropping someone at the end of the Harry Potter series.
<Crippler> awwww yeaaahhh
<Welsh_Pony> Oh god
<TheXIIILightning> FufufufufufuufKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
<Silverscreen> 1,11oh god
<PonySwagg> AlienWarhead: You are correct, sir. Mass Effect 3 deserved bettar.
<CriticKitten> YAY
<Sharakan> WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!
<Aegis3423> jubasihdybegfehjbde dghawd
<Kandarihu> There was never any explanation of how she went missing, only that she went into Black*Rock Shooter's world, and briefly had access to the cellular network.
<reddawn> lol
<GabeMoist> AWWWWW YEEEEAAAAAAH
<TheXIIILightning> pLEASE NO

<SunderlandPony89> Ok, what the hell is this?
<reddawn> BEST PLAY EVER
<Murky> Is it God save us all time?
<TheXIIILightning> Nonononononononono

<derpy_pony> yay

<RustyMeat> dat child
<AlienWarhead> That's what she said

<twilight_sprinkler> Meanwhile: you already said that. try again
<Sharakan> at least she was having fun
<Litwick> It's like a pansy Barney the Dinosaur....
<DocSane> Little girls at a My Little Pony show? THis can't be right.
<Welsh_Pony> How to.... what
<RAWRity> You know, I'm surprised I didn't see people shouting out "PRETENTIOUS!" at the end of that film to be honest.
<otakon> hell, they could have done that whole thing in 20 minutes with timeskips
<RustyMeat> OH NO
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol im gonna listen to some Ninja Sex Party
<StinkomanFan> G3
<Aegis3423> lol
<StinkomanFan> my god
<CriticKitten> Cipher: Nope.avi, you HAVE to see Rarity.
<derpy_pony> didn't we watch this yesterday?
<EpicPwnTime3> GAAAAAAASP!
<AlienWarhead> NO
<Sheepy> RainbowcrashNBurn: So you think this is the best thing in the world then huh?
<twilight_sprinkler> RAWRity: there were some
<DocSane> Jolly good!
<CriticKitten> Cipher: It must be seen to be believed.
<RustyMeat> NOP
<Aegis3423> anyone knows when will this end?
<AlienWarhead> NNNOOOOOO
<Sharakan> nope
<Murky> Should I unmute this for the full experience?
<Golakka> FIM live is worse StinkomanFan
<RAWRity> Since I've seen people throw out that word for damn near everything.
<PonySwagg> No.
<Cipher> 0,14...CriticKitten, ;ping me when that happens
<DocSane> Oh, unmute
<The_Party_Cannon> Nope.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Only if the movie is entirley alone, but theres a series to go with it if you want more.
<the_real_pony_1604> that........ is a G3 spike
<PonySwagg> I think it's fine being muted.
<RustyMeat> Oh my....
<AlienWarhead> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<StinkomanFan> No, no it isn't
<EpicPwnTime3> NOT THIS SHOW!!!! ANYTHING BUT THAT!!!!!!
<Silverscreen> 1,11...
<Golakka> it is
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkler: Eh, I'm a spur of the moment kind of guy, thinking things out only impedes the creativity.
<Aegis3423> .....
<Golakka> Its horrific
<The_Party_Cannon> Oh god...
<Sumica> 00,10ok I am back
<StinkomanFan> This is worse
<DocSane> Sing it! SING IT!
<Golakka> Its worse than newborn cuties
<twilight_sprinkler> that actually sounded depretty good from the audience
<Sharakan> ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<AlienWarhead> AAAAWWWWWWW
<Capn_Gavn> XD
<Silverscreen> 1,11I'm not even listening. :D
*GilDash trots back into the chat, smiling.
<Kokonoe> ollies outies
<RAWRity> So, no what's up for BMN?
<CriticKitten> Even Rainbow Dash isn't as bad as Rarity in this one. As much as people will scream about RD, Rarity's worse.
<CriticKitten> XD
<GilDash> So, what did I miss? :)
<Midnight_Fyre> I take it Blackrock Shooter just ended?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> nothing is worse than newborn cuties
<RustyMeat> Oh my
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: except we weren't watching the series, so it doesn't matter. If it can't stand on it's own as a stand alone movie then it's just confusing
<RRG_7> http://tinyurl.com/dyvwpe2

<DocSane> Oh, thank goodness.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> O_O?
<otakon> Meanwhile: I apologize about calling you a pretencious prick.
<twilight_sprinkler> Meanwhile: i cant agree with that, you can be creative without being spontaneous. id actually say being spontaneous isnt too creative
<RustyMeat> stream has been jacked
<CriticKitten> You should've let it run until Rarity. ;_;

*Meanwhile shrugpony.

<Golakka> So much for nuclear non-proliferation
<RainbowAsh> Wrek: Did you already stream any of s2 GoT?

<FlareChaser> Wrek: freakin' saved.
<DocSane> Most powerful non-nuclear explosive in Eva.
<flutter_spin> the text is very hard to read Wrek :(
<Murky> On the count of One. One!

*PonySwagg makes an attempt to hug GilDash. ^^
*GilDash hugs PonySwagg.
<otakon> In sure ance
<RAWRity> Meanwhile actually met Trixie at that show. He was nervous about asking out one of the dancers, but me and emangamer convinced him to go for it
<Sharakan> sounds like bulma

<Irish_Pony|Blind> Meanwhile ow! what was that for?!
<Shizuka> 13it is
<PonySwagg> This doesn' tlook like an episode, really.
<DocSane> My father is a professional asshole
<Litwick> Aw hell no. Not Neon Genesis.
<Acleps> GilDash: Yeah, I was kinda worried for him yesterday
<CriticKitten> NERV, as in "do you have the NERV to watch this series from start to finish without a break in between?"
<SunderlandPony89> Is the stream still broken for you guys?
<otakon> PonySwagg: it's the rebirth movie
<StinkomanFan> in-sue-rents
<GilDash> Acleps: He wasn't well was he? :(
<Lasharus> Not the dubbed version CriticKitten.
<RAWRity> >Putting Gendo Ikari in charge
<RAWRity> >You all gon Die
<otakon> oh god
<SunderlandPony89> Yes? No?
<Acleps> GilDash: No, not really... :(
<Lasharus> I'll stick with the original Japanese.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> CriticKitten: I do, and I did. As much as I hate some of the characters
<PonySwagg> otakon: Thought so. Quality is better.
<otakon> PonySwagg: eeyup
<GilDash> Acleps: I know I tease like a right bugger, but I do worry a lot too. :(
<EggWhite> Isn't rebith the old one or was that End of Evangelion?
<ScootaChicken> This animation looks way too good for a 90s anime
<Cipher> 0,14looks like Shinji is...
<ScootaChicken> Is this a remake or something?
<Meanwhile> NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRR...V.
<otakon> EggWhite: that was End
<CriticKitten> Yes, "somehow"
<Tovler> NEEEEEEEEERV
<RX-78-SweetieBot> no
*Cipher puts on flight goggles
<CriticKitten> You will be working for them "somehow"
<otakon> it has a ISBN!
<GilDash> FINALLY! My stream is working right! :)
<Cipher> 0,14NERVous
<RAWRity> EggWhite: it goes original series, End of Eva, then the Rebuild movies
<Om> GilDash: You wouldn't tease if you didn't care.
<Acleps> GilDash: It's good that someone worries :)
<GabeMoist> BOOOO
<Lasharus> ...
<FlareChaser> ...I...uh... WELL Imma bored so FlareChaser is gonna look up colgate pics...
<Meanwhile> Nnnoooooooooooooo
<PonySwagg> otakon: The only problem is... nothing's changed. Nothing's really stood out. Shinji's still a whiny little... nnnngh, I don't even wanna say it.
<EggWhite> There are too many movies to keep track of.
<Lasharus> Cipher, the only thing that keeps you from being slapped is that you're a mod.
<Crippler> waaaaaat
<Tovler> So THIS is Black Rock Shooter, eh? Looks nerdy
<Sharakan> wow the geofront
<otakon> PonySwagg: he is SUPPOSED to be whiny dammit!
<Ryanier128> DAMMIT! I missed the movies
<PonySwagg> otakon: Some part of me still thinks Evangelion and everything in it can go die in a fire.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> they really went out on the animation budget, so much that they ran out before the end and had to throw whatever shit they had together
<DocSane> THis is Rebirth of Evangelion
<drfsupercenter> 03SheenaFox: https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/5/17/vj-0WB-SxEKD862Q_2eKhQ2.jpg
<Cipher> 0,14Lasharus, that doesn't exempt from anything
<Ryanier128> oh, hello everypony
<glennglog22> hi
<Shizuka> 13this film does not have asuka
<pony-moon> hello
<Lasharus> No, but I don't want to get kicked. :P
<Irish_Pony|Blind> xD
*Ryanier128 is lost
<CriticKitten> >Keep moving
<SheenaFox> lol
<Meanwhile> But you do Shizu.
<CriticKitten> >Get there eventually
<ScootaChicken> So this is the original series?
<EggWhite> Isn't 3.33 or 4.0 coming out sometime soon?
<glennglog22> hi everypony
<Shizuka> 13but it does have shinji getting his flank handed to him by a d8, so that's cool
<Cipher> 0,14also, t my understanding Rebuild is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more optimistic
<Murky> Like every piece of dwarven engineering ever.
<SheenaFox> indeed
<otakon> PonySwagg: I don't really like it but that's bc it's a huge mindfuck and it's depressing really.
<CriticKitten> ....well guess I can't argue
<FlareChaser> Well, that was fun.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I think so
<RAWRity> Shizuka: it also, thankfully, doesn't have the...hospital...scene
<Tovler> Did the OVA of Black Rock Shooter play or was it the 8 episode series?
<RainbowAsh> PonySwagg, well, it is a deconstruction of the mecha genre. Shinji being the exact opposite of a sympathetic energetic hero is the point.
<Lasharus> This film doesn't have talented voice actors Shizuka. I'll prefer the Japanese, cheers. :p
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Heeeeellllllllllooooooooooo
<Ghosties> 04TAKE IT ALL OFF BABY
<FlareChaser|Colgate> Dat Ass.
<GilDash> Om, Acleps: Yeah, I guess so. :)
<Ghosties> 04RAWR
<ScootaChicken> I refuse to believe this.
<PonySwagg> otakon: Exactly! See what I mean?
<Ghosties> 04Um, ahem
<otakon> Cipher: ANYTHING is more optimistic
<junh1024-XD> oh lol
<Shizuka> 13ditto that Lasharus
<Ghosties> 04Excuse me >>
<junh1024-XD> i get it now
<glennglog22> i wanted to go to japan!
<SheenaFox> I'm making the diet plan for a fat person who wants to play tennis xD

<Lasharus> Most of them are, from what I'm hearing here.
<Om> GilDash: Dat bandwidth
<PonySwagg> And yes... his father is still a homicidal, sociopathic, emotionless robot.
<DocSane> Not all dubs suck. Just many of them.
<Cipher> 0,14STEVE BLUM?
<GabeMoist> Sumica, not all of them
*GilDash join PonyRP
<Lasharus> Oh I'm not criticising YOU Sumica.
<Ryanier128> what am I looking at?
*Irish_Pony|Blind cuddles GilDash while still in the barrel
<otakon> PonySwagg: eeyup
<Lasharus> I'm just criticising the dub. :P
<PonySwagg> The only thing that matters to him is The Plan.
<Shizuka> 13HI MOM
<Lasharus> I'm rather fond of my eardrums being intact, you see.
<FlareChaser|Colgate> Dat :P
<Shizuka> 13oh sorry
<Acleps> I guess I'll leave the chat open, but I won't probaly be fowllowing it... Can you ping me if pikorar comes here?
<Murky> I know the Gurran Laggan Dub is good, other than that subs tend to be better.
<DocSane> Yo mama!
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Shhhhhh!
<Crippler> It's....A thing!
<Silverscreen> 1,11You mean a Mecha?
<Ryanier128> what the hell?
<otakon> do they explain WHY the water is red in this?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> to be fair, Im not sure, since the remake movies and the series both start out really similar
<Conyst> we want you to pilot it
<PonySwagg> If I were Shinji I'd have taken a baseball bat to his face by now.
<panda> EVANGELION!
<DocSane> It's not water.
<RAWRity> ah yes, Neon Genisis Evangelion, where every single plot twist is "Shinji's Mom"
<Kandarihu> Evas aren't mechas
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<DocSane> Oh, the seas?
<Shizuka> 13otakon: all oceans are red, but also yeah this isn't water

<PonySwagg> GilDash: Sure thing.
<otakon> Meanwhile: and the start the movie like that?
<GilDash> Irish_Pony|Blind: There's not much room in here... ;)

<RX-78-SweetieBot> Well, it is about time I got around to properly watching these....
<otakon> Meanwhile: well he is but his mom died and his dad abandoned him for 3 years so yeah.
<DocSane> Not random, sadly.

<Shizuka> 13First rule of Evangelion: the Christian imagery is just symbols tacked onto the plot, they have no internal significance
<RX-78-SweetieBot> FlareChaser|Colgate: NGE loves to throw in random worthless references to christian religion
<FillyFlam> Just get in the damn mech already. :|
<kirzstryfe> 1,3wonder how it knew their location >.>
<PonySwagg> Seriously.
<PonySwagg> What an ass.
<K_A> Shizuka: That caught me off-guard at first.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> >EVA
<DeadpoolDash> Shinji the biggest bitch in anime EVER
<RX-78-SweetieBot> >Mech
<Ryanier128> Silverscreen: eeyup
<Ghosties> 04But Silverscreen, he's our only hope!
<FlareChaser|Colgate> kirzstryfe: Aliens.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> DOHOHO
<Conyst> I'm not dead yet
<DaringDude> Silverscreen: brilliant!
<otakon> dun dun DUUN
<Sumica> 00,10kirzstryfe they looked at there mini map
<Murky> Suddenly, the whole point of making Gurran Laggan is much clearer.
<Shizuka> 13Second Rule of Evangelion: Shinji is a wuss up through the end of Rebuild 2
<Meanwhile> You're right kid, no one needs you, now go away.
<DocSane> Shinji, only hero I know who jacked himself off over his comatose girlfriend.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: to be fair, that's how most christian imagery works in Anime.
<PonySwagg> XD
<EggWhite> In the end of 3.33 he gets some balls.
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: How long is that?
<panda> Shizuka: hehe :D
<BronyCody> Waht is this called.
<FlareChaser|Colgate> Boooobs!
<FlareChaser|Colgate> I mean, what.
<otakon> And suddenly Rei is wounded from the beginning
<Shizuka> 13Third Rule of Evangelion: the motto of this series is "it gets worse", every time
<RAWRity> Shizuka: Shinji is ALWAYS a wuss.
<PonySwagg> Animation is better.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Fourth Rule of Evangelion: Shinji is still going to be a bitch in the end
<teh_Tharassan> Bandages...
<DaringDude> Wrek stream yesterday was awesome XD
<PonySwagg> Much better.
<otakon> Shizuka: and you LIKE this?
<Sumica> 00,10hey at lest shizi dosent fap all over auska in this one
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: yeah but that's cause they dropped a bridge on her :<
<PonySwagg> God, that smile...
<Ryanier128> Shizuka that sound's like the rule for Twilight
<DeadpoolDash> fap fap fap
<K_A> Shizuka: Question. Is this a remake following the original story or a new take? Because this is just like the first ep so far to me.
<Ryanier128> Sparkle
<PonySwagg> That shit-eating grin
<FlareChaser|Colgate> and then there came the fics.
<PonySwagg> I. Hate. Gendo Ikari.
*GilDash is reminded of Zone of the Enders.
<Golakka> Hey wrek or Sumica , Does the alliance have a webpage yet, or is anyone working on one?
<RAWRity> The only part of the franchise where he ISN'T a complete wuss is in the Manga. and even then he's not exactly a strong, independent black woman.
<Shizuka> 13K_A: Rebuild 1.0 more or less follows the first four ish eps exactly, with some plot elements changed
<otakon> yeah kid that's blood
<reddawn> its that time of the month
<FlareChaser|Colgate> k, wat.
<RainbowAsh> K_A, yes, it follows the original series to a T, at least for this first movie
<Sumica> 00,10not so far as i know Golakka
<RX-78-SweetieBot> K_A its a remake with some differences but also possibly a sequel of a loop sequence
<Shizuka> 13for instance, in the original series, EVA01 protects Shinji from falling debris there
<Meanwhile> Mother of god that kid is so damn whiny.
<Ryanier128> "there is blood on my hand!"
<kirzstryfe> 1,3like the crazy bitch in pink that shows up in rebuild 2?
<twilight_sprinkler> where do they get so much blood
<otakon> Meanwhile: eeyup
<Golakka> Want me to rattle one out, not doing anything
<PonySwagg> XD
<LittleBrony> I am still here...wating patiently for MLP...ahhhhh
<K_A> Shizuka, RainbowAsh, RX-78-SweetieBot: OK, cool beans.
<PonySwagg> Psychological contamination is within the standard range, huh?
<FlareChaser|Colgate> Midnight_Tempest: what? your playing L4D2 now?
<Meanwhile> Breathing liquid. Ick.
<twilight_sprinkler> goddamn that must be unpleasant
<otakon> ah yes, LCL
<PonySwagg> And that means being in the robot messes your head up either way.
<Ryanier128> Meanwhile you should have been here last night! I was drunk and Wrek was drawing and it was all just a big clusterfuck
<Shizuka> 13mari better have some kind of payoff in rebuild 3 cause she just makes no sense in 2
<K_A> Fabulous!
<Midnight_Tempest> FlareChaser|Colgate: no... testing some mods actually, and sprays
<Golakka> there is a liquid that you can breathe in, I forgrt the name
<RX-78-SweetieBot> once again
<Meanwhile> Sounds like a riot Ryanier128. >_>
<Tovler> Wait. So I bought this pizza for nothing?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> >EVA
<DeadpoolDash> rebuild is a retelling of the original story, but with some stuff added and/or changed.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> >Robot
<FlareChaser|Colgate> Midnight_Tempest: Alright, hopefully we can all play later.
<GilDash> Golakka: Really?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> lol
<LiquidFire> Why are you guys breathing me? D:
<SunderlandPony89> Is that EDI?
<Golakka> Ill see if i can find it GilDash
<RAWRity> Shizuka: something in Eva not paying off later on? parish the thought.
<otakon> okay guys, brb have to water the plants
<GilDash> Golakka: I'd appreciate it.
<Cipher> 0,14STEVEN J BLUM
<Cipher> 0,14I HEARD HIM
<RX-78-SweetieBot> no
<FlareChaser|Colgate> That reminds me...
<Golakka> They use it for people with incredible burns
<Cipher> 0,14I'D RECOGNIZE HIS SEXY VOICE ANYWHERE
<Vordox> Who Cipher ?
<Sumica> 00,10but shizu she was the muguffen cause they droped a bridge
<reddawn> spike mech
<Murky> Yes, there is a liquid that you can breathe, but not for extended periods of time: it destroys your diaphram.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Hey, what film is this?
<RAWRity> Vordox: he's saxy
<Meanwhile> Why did they paint the robot purple?
<PONY> Saturn: http://aijaa.com/0030710216753 Better?
<Irish_Pony|Blind> PREPARE TO FIRE VOLDKA CANNON!
<DeadpoolDash> blum is in everything
<K_A> reddawn: Oh god it is Spike's color scheme.
<SunderlandPony89> Aww

<RX-78-SweetieBot> the only robot in this show is Jet Alone
<FlareChaser|Colgate> I want to get Drunk.
<K_A> A bit darker, though
<Sumica> 00,10spike mech is go for launch
<Meanwhile> And now the mech is Spike. Cannot unsee.
<Shizuka> 13just cause they were lazy developing toji
*Irish_Pony|Blind passes FlareChaser|Colgate whiskey
<Ryanier128> Meanwhile it was. Scoot-Scootaloo went all raging because everybody was breaking the rules and I was really wishing you were there. I'm guessing nobody told you what Wrek was drawing, right?
<FlareChaser|Colgate> Thanks Irish_Pony|Blind
<Golakka> I know its a type of florocarbon GilDash
*FlareChaser|Colgate drinks the whiskey.
<DeadpoolDash> Toji was going to be so awesome
<GilDash> Golakka: I'll have to have a look myself now.
<Meanwhile> Ryanier128: Everyone and their goddamn Grandma has told me what he was drawing.
<Shizuka> 13gendo doesn't have nearly a deep enough voice
<Sharakan> ITs got a unicorn horn
<Shizuka> 13needs to have more of a sinister gravel
<DeadpoolDash> then they gimped/killed him
<PonySwagg> Hey, dude.
<Shizuka> 13all right kid, don't get cocky
<Sumica> 00,10did any one tell the kid how to drive it?
<DeadpoolDash> enope
<Golakka> Perfluorohexane GilDash
<EggWhite> Nope.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3his mom told him how
<Shizuka> 13LIFT OFF
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and I dont think Jet Alone even shows up in the remake movies
<Meanwhile> And then he fell over.
<Om> This seireis has decent music.

<PonySwagg> You have no idea.

<PonySwagg> SNAP
<Meanwhile> Ryanier128: I don't know who that is, but say hi back for me.
<Vordox> O.o
<ScootaChicken> So... Why are they letting a young, probably around 14 year old boy pilot a giant, dangerous robot?
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Oh shit son!
<FlareChaser|Colgate> Sheeeet

<K_A> ScootaChicken: In the original series, he had a connection that gets explained... interestingly.
<F22skyhunter> DED

<Ryanier128> thanks Meanwhile
<EggWhite> Berserk mode activated.
<ScootaChicken> K_A: I'll assume 'interestingly' means lots of Freudian and Chrisian imagery.
<FlareChaser|Colgate> ALL OF SUDDEN: High.
<Vordox> Shizuka: Hur hur hur

<DeadpoolDash> HULK SMASH
<ScootaChicken> *Christian

<DaringDude> RAWR
<Litwick> Berserker?
<PonySwagg> RAAAAAAGE
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Shizuka: I never got around to watching the remakes yet, but have heard a ton about them

<Shizuka> 13it's a space station
<Golakka> Aye GilDash, I love useless tipbits of information :p
<SunderlandPony89> HA! There's a community challenge in Impostors for NOT playing the game for a certain amount of time
<Vordox> "We've done it"
<EggWhite> He has a mouth because spoilers.
<K_A> I'm watching this particular iteration the first time, but I loved the original series until it forgot what it was doing.
<Sumica> 00,10how else will it nom with out a mouth
<Shizuka> 13no! not the stop sign!
<SunderlandPony89> +
<Golakka> sadly i have no use for it in my fanfic
<flutter_spin> O.o
<PonySwagg> I'll get that arm back, thank you.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> lol
<Meanwhile> RainbowAsh: Because it's a robot designed for combat with big ugly things, having the ability to roar is not beneficial.
<PrincessLuna> I had a mouth once, then I took an arrow to the knee
<Aegis3423> ....
<Meanwhile> In fact, it's a structural failing.
<Shizuka> 13shogouki laughs at your puny psychological defenses!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Meanwhile: its not a robot
<SamanthaGirl159> hello everypony

<RX-78-SweetieBot> Meanwhile: it is not a robot, or a mech, or mechanical other than some of the outer armor

<kirzstryfe> 1,3hmm, watch along with the stream, or put in my bluray copy... >.>
<RAWRity> There's a LOT I could be criticising here (the pacing is awkward as hell, dialogue doesn't make sense, the direction is way too close) but the most irritating factor is that god damn MUSIC.
<SamanthaGirl159> . . .
*Irish_Pony|Blind cuddles GilDash harder
<panda> OH DAMN!
<twilight_sprinkler> bloodrayne
<FlareChaser|Colgate> kirzstryfe: with us :|

<RX-78-SweetieBot> ScootaChicken: The only robot in NGE is Jet Alone, and I dont know if it shows up in these movies
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkler: Litterally...
<GilDash> ScootaChicken: I'm assuming they're all piloted by people.
<K_A> I like how in the TWO EPISODES that ran on Toonami they cut off all the crosses.
<Shizuka> 13i'd put in my dvd but more fun to be synced with chat

<RAWRity> Shizuka: so...how many times do they have Shinji go on the train in these movies? I'm guessin 4
<flutter_spin> O.o
<Meanwhile> Gah
<Sumica> 00,10depends on if any one wants me to stop or not kirzstryfe
<Aegis3423> O.o

<Shizuka> 13it doesn't have as much impact as switch
<FlareChaser|Colgate> Pull da Trigger.

<PonySwagg> Even she knows Shinji's not supposed to be here.
<pikorar> Lol, they're sitting as if they give no fucks.
<GilDash> PONY: I'd like to see you. :)

<EggWhite> NERV our machines are not aesthetically pleasing.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Kipkat07_Mare: GilDash was here before you...and we've been having fun ;)

<Shizuka> 13skyrim not as much
<Rain> indeed, Shizuka
<Ryanier128> seeya Sumica . . . wait, who's leaving?
<Kandarihu> Subbed anime + IRC = too much to read and follow at the same time.

<PinkiePieYoshi64> Get a cruise missile.... Or a Nightfury to do it :D
<Darf14> lol
<Kurra> Nah, 19's not enough, and we thought 23 or 24 was just overkill so...
<K_A> It's an octahedron. Octahedra don't have brains.
<CriticKitten> The fools! If only they'd built it with 23 armor belts! When will they learn.... [/Fry]
<Amaron> lol Om xD

<Amaron> OPERATION YASH. GO.

<RAWRity> all of them
<Dermathil> Killerpony7733: they'd raze the city and the HQ under
<Cipher> 0,14figured as much
<EggWhite> A nuke in a railgun isn't strong enough.
<PrincessLuna> So wait, did they jam all the angels in this movie?
<DocSane> The level of nuking required would also destroy NERV.
<Soupcan> snipin a good job mate.
<RAWRity> Cipher: twice

<PrincessLuna> Om: ohh
<PonySwagg> She's worried about Shinji...
<Amaron> DASHY?
<K_A> PonySwagg: Well I meant in the art style. It feels a bit more ambient than I remember. And the CGI here is used appropriately.
<Irish_Pony|Blind> GilDash well then you'll do ;)
<Darf14> Blackout at midnight ......so many people wont be able to play Starcraft 2
<RAWRity> PrincessLuna: not ALL of them.

<Dken2021> oh ok
<PrincessLuna> Om: Yea
<PonySwagg> K_A: True. Like I said, the animation is sleeker and cleaner. The bad news... is the story hasn't been upgraded to match the visuals.

<K_A> Pink lighting though? Really? I'd go blind in that crap.
<SamanthaGirl159> Silverscreen have you ever played the Stephen King Drinking Game?
<stallion1> lol
<Kandarihu> I find it ironic that everyone's holding Shinji to the standard of the EXACT kind of archetype that this series is meant to deconstruct.
<pikorar> Click click click!
<Cow> Dear god this looks cool... i mean, MOO!
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Momception! But please, no jokes about needing to go deeper. This is Evangelion, I think that joke pretty much makes itself happen.
<PrincessLuna> pikorar: True story :(
<otakon> SamanthaGirl159: lol, is that from Nostalia Critic?
<hen3ry> We have a problem here! We've run out of superlative adjectives!
<PonySwagg> See this is what fan fiction is for. To give a main character like this something else to hold onto. XD
<PrincessLuna> KABOOM!
<Darf14> Looks like a sniper rifle
<Soupcan> wheres sniper?
<Om> Theoreticaly.
<TheXIIILightning2> That's a big cannon

<Silverscreen> 1,11SamanthaGirl159: Sorta. Not old enough for actual alcohol.
<WallDives> I'm back.
<Dermathil> Darf: that's the point
<PrincessLuna> Darf14: You're perception is exemplary :)
<pikorar> THE PIROT NEEDS DISIPRINE!
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Kandarihu: some people actually like the archetype this series tries to deconstruct

<Silverscreen> 1,11"Made up your own mind"
<SamanthaGirl159> otakon: eeyup. It is SO much fun! It actually makes watching his movies interesting!
<FillyFlam> You know if I didn't know that a positron was actually a thing I would think that name was totally stupid.
<PonySwagg> What, it's up to Misato to bring him around?
<Silverscreen> 1,11He was tricked into it, you bitch.
<User0> otakon: I'm well aware.
<PrincessLuna> pikorar: xD
<Kurra> Freudian analogies from heaven Shizuka.... @_@ *wobble*

*WallDives is glomped

<pikorar> They're in the future and that's not digital?
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Oh god
<Sumica> 00,10love in an elevator
<Kandarihu> And I suppose that if fans had heeded the deconstruction of this series, the mecha genre would've ended with this.
<RAWRity> "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Fighting to save the earth is so haaaaaard."
<PonySwagg> I mean seriously, he's COMPLAINING.
<K_A> Not as devastating as the Black Plague was.
<Galloran> Sumica: thats a song

<Darf14> wow....thats far
<pikorar> What is that?
<otakon> the FUCK IS ALL THAT!?
<K_A> Wait, no, I think I got it backwards. 1/3 was lost, not left.
<pikorar> Is that the inside of my brain?
<WallDives> and anyone whose seen it knida knows. "I'm fucked up". that is all.
<CriticKitten> otakon: Phallic symbol.
