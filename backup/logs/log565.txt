<twi_sprinkle_GS17> why does it randomly turn on
<Jim> Tribes: Ascend, ey?
<otakon17> No idea
<otakon17> Anyway, out for now
<FairysHuff> Jim I tried playing that but the community are dicks to new players
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> bye otakon17
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> bai otakon17
<otakon17> Take care eh?
<oni_link> bye otakon17
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> FairysHuff: its because the game is very competitive
<Wrek> 05wodner if this has a windowed mode
<Jim> Warhammer 40k, ey?
<Jim> I recently bought that
<FairysHuff> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG No point in my playing then. It's no fun playing with people who only know how to scream obscenities down a mic from thousands of miles away
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> FairysHuff: lol no one really talks
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> FairysHuff: dont think there is voice chat
<Jim> I've never heard anyone talk in tribes ascend
<Chocobunny> Wrek should stream some Warhammer 40k.
<FairysHuff> Oh please god no.
<oni_link> FairysHuff: This is why I don't play COD anymore. Any yahoo can build up a kill streak using an over powered weapon and run their mouth thinking they are good.
<FairysHuff> No Warhammer. Please
<Chocobunny> I don't like it either, but it's something.
<Jim> why not?
<Elarcis> Well, howdy, fellow humans/ponies/whatsoever !
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> oni_link: Tribes is kinda balanced
<Chocobunny> Hello, fellow.. whatever.
<Jim> hey Elarcis
<oni_link> Hello Elarcis, whatever you are :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hi Elarcis
<Elarcis> Well, Octopus for me.
<oni_link> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I have no FPS to play, and no PC to run one if I did :P
<Jim> Warhammer 40k you say? http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/295e498ae62ca9b984629cb68f6e9e02/87338%20-%20artist%3Alaaseensld%20balloon%20cutie_mark%20flamethrower%20highres%20parody%20pinkie_pie%20ponified%20space_marine%20warhammer_40k%20weapon.jpg
<Jim> that link got too big :/
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Tinyurl
<FairysHuff> Can we have some midgets in tutus playing harmonicas while sky diving into jello?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> just saying
<Chocobunny> FairysHuff: I'll have what he's having!
<alexxm> can someone stream botchamania
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Tribes is also kinda boring to play after awhile
<FairysHuff> I play for fun. Not for E-Penis
<oni_link> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I think I'll stick with TF2 and
<Wrek> 051 sec
<oni_link> RPGs
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oni_link: good for you
<Wrek> 05solving shit
<Chocobunny> Wrek, will you open the server tonight again?
<FairysHuff> JPRGs with turnbased battle systems ftw.
<oni_link> FairysHuff: you are my kind of player
<Chocobunny> ^^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol im very competitive
<Chezne> speaking of JRPG, any ponies in PSO2?
<FairysHuff> *Hates the new Final Fantasys after Enix bought Square*
<oni_link> ^ ^ ^
<oni_link> FFX was the last good one IMO
<oni_link> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I am competetive with what I get comfortable with.
<FairysHuff> oni_link That was the last one to have a semi turnbased battle system. I was still un happy with the removal of the explorable world map
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> oh boy Warhammer
<ACS13123> Wrek Stream ;D
<Unnr> Speeeeece Mahhhhren!
<FairysHuff> >_>
<oni_link> FairysHuff: Twas a bit more linear but I still enjoyed it more than Final Hallway XIII
<CupcakeExtreme01> I can stand ads. I can stand buffering. I cannot stand buffering ads.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yay Hard
<pony_7310> dat steam sale
<FairysHuff> oni_link True
<ACS13123> CupcakeExtreme01: Simple, get adblock
<Unnr> Ave Imperator.
<oni_link> Ad Blocker plus on Firefox/Nightly :)
<FairysHuff> Warhammer isn't my thing. But I'll watch this for a bit I suppose.
<Quick_Thinker> the hay?
<Unnr> FairysHuff, this game is gloriously over the top
<Chocobunny> Hmm..
<oni_link> I've always wanted to watch somepony play this game.
<Quick_Thinker> any other pony see hyrle sign?
<Chocobunny> I might go and play something..
<oni_link> Quick_Thinker: me :P
<Chocobunny> SFM!
<derpy_pony> this game looks interesting
<FairysHuff> Unnr To each their own. I just found the Warhammer mythos to be so very boring.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm Terran Days
<derpy_pony> never played warhammer
<Unnr> FairysHuff, it often tries too hard, but this game is just silly.
<Chocobunny> Serious face.
<ACS13123> Forge world? What is this Halo: Reach?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<oni_link> ^ ^ ^ ^ IKR
<oni_link> damn it
<alexxm> serious buisness
<Unnr> You will be GRIMDARK and you will like it!
<Chocobunny> Stalker?
<oni_link> I miss that game :(
<Chocobunny> Hmm.. I need a good laugh.
<Stuffjusthappened> What game is this?
<alexxm> so is this an RTS or a shooter
<FairysHuff> Stalker was a good game.
<RobertRevenge> Oh look, Warhammer
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shooter alexxm
<Jim> Blood for the blood god!
<Chocobunny> Stalker IS a good game.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> this keeps reminding me of Warcraft and Starcraft
<alexxm> thanks Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<oni_link> FairysHuff: It came with my last tower. I loved the open world.
<oni_link> Two more months I'm hoping is the time I will have a new one.
<FairysHuff> I ALMOST bought this during sale only because it was so cheap. Glad I didn't now.
<Chocobunny> Way to kill the chat.
<FairysHuff> Its what I do best
<derpy_pony> ded
<RobertRevenge> So who is streaming?
<Chocobunny> Wrek.
<Unnr> In other news, the Khornate creed is really easy to sing to Gitchee Gitchee Goo from Phineas and Ferb
<Unnr> Blood for the blood god, that´s what the Khornate said!
<Unnr> Skulls, skulls, skulls, cause the throne keeps growin´
<Chocobunny> Well, that's one retarded turret.
<Wrek> 05brb
<oni_link> If its any consolation, I had fun talking with you FairysHuff.
<RobertRevenge> Chocobunny: You'd think such an obvious weakness would be corrected.
<Chocobunny> RobertRevenge: The budget.
<Chocobunny> Anyone know a good Terraria server?
<FairysHuff> no
<Unnr|AFK> 127.0.0.1
<oni_link> Bye everypony! Im calling it a night now. Well, more like morning over here. Also thanks Wrek for the stream.

<Chocobunny> Robert, screw Terraria, come play some Smite with me.
<RobertRevenge> I have no clue what that is.
<Chocobunny> Google it.
<Chocobunny> Smite.
<FairysHuff> It's like crack cocaine but worse.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Smite is weird
<RobertRevenge> So it's pretty much a over the shoulder RTS? I'm in.
<RobertRevenge> *an
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> its more third person shooter

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> WarHammer Space marine

<Chocobunny> Friends are people who accept and enjoy being around you, because you're who you are.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> RobertRevenge: yeah but its just an avatar
<Chocobunny> Tribes sucked asshair with Ramen noodles.
*RobertRevenge shrugpony

<Jim> lol
<Chocobunny> Robert, you're not online on Steam? It says you were last on 2 hours ago.
<RobertRevenge> I don't know anything about CoD/Battlefield or anything like that. So I just assume it's manly.
<RobertRevenge> And I am online o_o
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Steam is glitchy
<Chocobunny> Hm..
<Chocobunny> Alright, brb.

<Cypresswolf> Just took a stroll by my part of the creek - water is still really high, be at least a week before I can get close enough to the creek to measure just how high it went
<RobertRevenge> We had torrential rains here for the past week while I was camping out of state.
<Cypresswolf> with last summer's drought, creek bed was bone dry - I thought it would take years to fill back up - all the rain helped in that regard
<Cypresswolf> also, found a leak in both my boots in the process :P time for some fishing waders
<Cypresswolf> not even going to attempt to drive around today - last night several roads were still baracaded off
<alexxm> damn how bad were the floods there Cypresswolf
<Cypresswolf> Thursday it poured down rain all day - up to 6 inches an hour
<Wrek> 05back again
<Cypresswolf> last night coming back from taco bell, there was still water under the overpasses at the closest highway intersection
<Cypresswolf> alexxm: I live close to the creek - on the higher side, but still got flooded a bit - the low side...Im sure there are sections of neighborhoods that still cant get out
<alexxm> damn that bad then

<Very_Silly_Filly> Fluttershy looks really scary
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Wow. You should enter a Spelling Bee or something.
<Rodney> how is that a season 3 spoiler
<Rodney> ._.

<Quick_Thinker> NOT FLUTTERSHY HOW COULD YOU
<Quick_Thinker> i honestly would not have the guts to even say hi to fluttershy for fear she will run away
<Pudge> You must protect fluttershy at all costs Wrek
<Barbetos> Fluttershy is OP.
<Barbetos> Looks like blue is gona win.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I just got news about my laptop, hopefully it will be fixed by Augst
<Very_Silly_Filly> When it's fixed, I can enjoy speed again
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek was killed by Rarity.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That must be awesome.
<Pudge> Very_Silly_Filly: what kind of laptop is it?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Still, can't run Crysis, or pretty much any game from 2009 onwards
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pudge: Dell inspiron 1545 upgraded
<Quick_Thinker> also i think im more shy then her i never talked to anybody in school (but next year thanks to the loving brony community and swag i will get and Canterlot Garden con i will be much more social
<Barbetos> Whats really funny is I think Rarity's whining stuns the other team. lol
<Pudge> Very_Silly_Filly: if you want a modern gaming laptop you should invest in an ailenware laptop
<Barbetos> Not... sure if trolling...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pudge: I could buy a decent laptop for 400 quid, but I literally have 0 money
<Very_Silly_Filly> I can piss poor
<Very_Silly_Filly> am*
<Quick_Thinker> what u mean?
<Pudge> wait
<Pudge> quid?
<CK|Catnap> Alienware: the name you trust for overpriced Dell hardware. :p
<Chezne> ^
<Barbetos> Serious though Alienware laptops are not so bad. Some of them you can take apart to change out the dedicated graphics cards.
<sub06905> Wrek: are u playing on ur server?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Grr. I'm used to talking to Brits
<Quick_Thinker> also im trying to find pony skins on the workshop what do i search for ?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Alienware is overpirced IMO, you are paying for the name
<Pudge> I'm amurican :)
<GilDash> Very_Silly_Filly: £400 huh? :)
<Barbetos> lol
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah
<MadSurge> :D dat apt Benny Hill music
<Barbetos> Luna died fast
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Overpriced like PC Xbox 360 controllers?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nittany_Discord: Yup
<Pudge> those 60 dollar infernal things
<Quick_Thinker> i still remebered when they played it in the phonix episode
<AttacktheAndalite> dat Benny Hill
<GilDash> Yeah, Alienware is a fancey name, nothing more.
<Pudge> just get a wired 360 controller just as good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01$60 for a controller is stupid.
<Very_Silly_Filly> My XBOX controller costed me around 40 quid
<FillyFlam1> ^
<Barbetos> Oh look its AJ, and she is on Fire.
<Very_Silly_Filly> For wired
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And they do nothing special.
<Barbetos> Normal day at sweet apple acres.
<Pudge> my wireless 360 controller cost me 60 bucks at frys
<Quick_Thinker> also guys just asking but im trying to find MLP FIM stuff in the steam workshop what do i search up?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I might make my own Controller
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have the family members who have the kit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just buy a Logitech and download Xpadder or something.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tons cheaper.
<Quick_Thinker> for TF2 to be more specific
<Pudge> but seriously people, if you want a good controller for the pc, get a ps2 controller
<Pudge> they're cheap
<Very_Silly_Filly> I already own 2 xbox 360 controllers
<Barbetos> Is the server playing the song? Or is it Wrek? =P
<Barbetos> Punch Rarity!
<Barbetos> lol
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pudge: Dualshock controllers rape my hands, not ergenomic enough
<AttacktheAndalite> That fitting music.
<Pudge> Very_Silly_Filly: do you have big hands?
<Very_Silly_Filly> No, small/
<Very_Silly_Filly> One is fine, the other is very handicapped
<Pudge> ah, i see. get a wired 360 controller then? I think you can use those
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have one
<CrimsonPhoenix> aw shit
<CrimsonPhoenix> my favorite song
<Pudge> i'm mad because the plug and play cord doesnt work with pcs
<MadSurge> Dat caramelldansen :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Plus PS3 controllers are too spergy to get working
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Very_Silly_Filly: Tried Motionjoy?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nope
<CrimsonPhoenix> Aaaaw shit
<Very_Silly_Filly> I only recognise this music from Meet the Pyro
<CrimsonPhoenix> Very_Silly_Filly, really?
<CrimsonPhoenix> kids these days
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a real song
<CrimsonPhoenix> it is
<Very_Silly_Filly> CrimsonPhoenix: I don't really listen to music
<CrimsonPhoenix> ooh
<Very_Silly_Filly> The only music I really listen to is Beatles and Oasis
<BronyBro> is 2day brony day?
<CrimsonPhoenix> then again this is used in a lot of movies
<CrimsonPhoenix> brony 'apreciation' day
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm one of the few "kids" who like retro over new

<Pudge> peanut butter fudge is the best
<Very_Silly_Filly> Meanwhile's favourite song

<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: Because of Trixie? :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah, hehe
<Chezne> which song is this?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Wait, did I hear Eduard Khil in there?
<CrimsonPhoenix> that trololo
<AttacktheAndalite> Very_Silly_Filly: Or any song with Trixie
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pretty much
<Very_Silly_Filly> Meanwhile even goes the extra mile and hates twix bars
<AttacktheAndalite> Very_Silly_Filly: And yes, you did hear Eduard Khil in the song
<Very_Silly_Filly> Heh, nice
<AttacktheAndalite> Chezne: Trixie the Pony Troll by Alex S.
<Pudge> dat benny hill
<Very_Silly_Filly> Well, she did pull a umad face
<Pudge> dont you just hate pyros
<AttacktheAndalite> Is anyone else's stream behind by a minute?
<Pudge> i know i do
<Chezne> an Alex S. song I'm missing it seems, thanks AttacktheAndalite
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pyros are overpowered, even after the HUGE nerf
<Very_Silly_Filly> In 2007, Pyros were retarded
<AttacktheAndalite> Chezne: You're welcome. It's on YouTube, or it should be.
<AttacktheAndalite> Anyone's else's stream behind by a minute or so, or is it just me?
<killerpony7733> AttacktheAndalite: I don't know
<Very_Silly_Filly> Dammit, he has a strange Bazzarr bargain
<AttacktheAndalite> killerpony7733: I refresh and it seems like the actual stream is ahead and mines is behind.
<Pudge> should i get TF2?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yes
<Very_Silly_Filly> You can either, waste your life playing TF2
<Pudge> I played it on the 360 orange box it got old real quick
<Very_Silly_Filly> Or you can waste your life even more by playing VoD
<Very_Silly_Filly> CoD*
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pudge: 360 and PS3 TF2 are crap, PC TF2 is good

<sonicandmario85> i show it all over the fucking internet
<sonicandmario85> XD
<Pudge> like joining pony groups and adding people on steam from here who have pony avatars
<Chocobunny> People around me (exc. family) are shallow bastards.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm mixed now. I started out as a closed brony. Now I show it off a bit.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I keep it from some.
<Pudge> I keep it from my IRL fans
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Nittany_Discord: lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And keep ponies out of places where they don't belong.
<Very_Silly_Filly> My mum knows, but I told her I'd shoot her if she told anyone
<Chocobunny> Nittany_Discord Example?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Public.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unless around other bronies.
<MadSurge> I don't see why I should tell everyone I meet. Only if I feel comfortable and I trust the person.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I only really express bronydom here,
<Very_Silly_Filly> Everywhere else, I actually pretend to hate.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yes, I'm srsbrah
<sonicandmario85> i dont show im a brony in real life i show it all over the fucking internet even minecraft XD
<Chezne> myself and my car are ponied out, hard to hide it
<CupcakeExtreme01> its Discord's voice
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I don't go pony-crazy around people that don't care for ponies. Not everyone likes ponies.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Poor meanwhile
<Very_Silly_Filly> That sea monster is meanwhile :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<AttacktheAndalite> Lol Very_Silly_Filly
<AttacktheAndalite> His moostache!
<sonicandmario85> where did you get the celestia and luna skin? XD
<Cypresswolf> Mustache is SRS business
<MadSurge> What a world, what a world!
<Pudge> you're freaking lucky if you have irl brony friends
<panda> Pudge: agreed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All of my brony friends are back in PA.
<Wrek> 05fail :P
<panda> Wrek: what wazzat?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Poor Wrek.
<Pudge> Hey do you need that good of a pc to run TF2?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> dammit Wrek :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*ding*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spy is hard to play.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> naw
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Trixie!
<Pudge> I have an NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spy is also annoying to die to.
<Very_Silly_Filly> The more you move to the right for TF2 classes is how hard they are to play
<Chrysalis> pudge i used to run it on my old netbook
<MadSurge> Dat Flutterguy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rainbow Dash!
<Applechip> I don't personaly know any bronies irl. But whenever i walk around my college campus with my derpy t-shirt, i almost always get a bro-hoof from some random person. Always fun :)
<Jspang1> anypony here?
<Very_Silly_Filly> My school is becoming 60% brony
<killerpony7733> Jspang1: Obviously
<Very_Silly_Filly> But fucktard brony, not decent brony
<Pudge> I'm not here
<Jspang1> i just joined and didnt see any text
<Jspang1> sorry
<panda> is it just me or is Wrek a little off today?
<killerpony7733> panda: Dunno maybe
<MadSurge> I just go around with my .mov shirts and troll people that don't know what they are :D
<Jspang1> im so much worse
<Pudge> he was going beastmode with the spy earlier
<panda> Pudge: just my timing then?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pudge: Only because he had the HP to last
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Feed the box.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have a strange Black Box
<Very_Silly_Filly> It was my first strange item
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> kewl
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have strange items from trades.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Mine was from a trade
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Do you get strange items from drops?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I don't trade much, all my items are honest earned loot
<MadSurge> GO DEMOMAN
<MadSurge> Jumping RD :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Solider is the only class I'm good at, never really been good at TF2
<MadSurge> NOOO TWILIGHT
<Cypresswolf> Dont have any brony friends irl, but have met several around Houston at meetups
<panda> Irony.... Wrek gets killed by Twilight Sparkle XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek might be happy Twilight killed him.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Twilight is his favorite pony.
<MadSurge> ^
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ikr
<panda> Nittany_Discord: hehe ninja'd again XD
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts panda
<Pudge> I would think it would make him sad to have to fight Twilight
*Very_Silly_Filly places a fan next to Nittany_Discord and turns it to 3
<MadSurge> I'm happy to just kill someone with the Pyro :D
<panda> I think he may have given up willingly... killing Twi, would kill his hopes and dreams
*Nittany_Discord 11,01's hair flows in the wind
<Very_Silly_Filly> Is it me or is someone micraging?
<MadSurge> Sneaking around and spychecking is pretty fun
<panda> Nittany_Discord is the new Fabio
<Cypresswolf> only talk about FIM and stuff with those at the office on occasion and my brother when I get something new in the mail - 2 co workers outside of that
<Very_Silly_Filly> I really need to learn online programming, I'd totally make a pony game
<RAWRity> bonjour
<WindWhistler> Wow, chat is quiet today
<MadSurge> Bonjour RAWRity!
<ponibas> geronimo?
<RAWRity> How's it going for everybody?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Mum has made cupcakes
<Very_Silly_Filly> They aren't ready yet
<MadSurge> WindWhistler: it was even quieter an hour ago!
<Very_Silly_Filly> My body is, though
<Pudge> Riverside
<Pudge> LETS GO
*Nittany_Discord 11,01sits on panda-femalezebra
<Very_Silly_Filly> Love this song
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Adventure!
<panda-femalezebra> xD
<Very_Silly_Filly> What's it called?
<WindWhistler> Welp, I'm bored.
*panda-femalezebra gallops with Nittany_Discord on his back!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay! A zebra ride!
<Very_Silly_Filly> What's this song with Engi called? I am curious
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek lost to his love again.
<Cypresswolf> Was anyone following the events at Comic Con? What else went on outside of ponies?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Twilight is Trixie.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol
<AttacktheAndalite> Very_Silly_Filly: It's on the tip of my tongue but I can't remember the name.
<WindWhistler> STOP BEING SO QUIET PEOPLE
<WindWhistler> Or maybe my chat derped upon logging in...
<Nyria> WindWhistler: No~ It's just a tad bit quiet~
<WindWhistler> Nyria: That's an understatement
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek always gets Rariy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*Rarity
<Very_Silly_Filly> His chosen pony is Raritty
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So Rarity is a spy.
<Very_Silly_Filly> ofc
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I guess RD is a scout.
<killerpony7733> Love this song
<Cypresswolf> ..nothing much of note from what I can tell...
<killerpony7733> Song cover reminds me too much of star wards kinect
<killerpony7733> wars*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What pony would the heavy be?
<Unnr> Heavy would be Buffalo
<Cypresswolf> Heavy would be Snowflake (fandom name: Roid Rage)
<AttacktheAndalite> Or Big mac
<WindWhistler> Snowflake = SNOWFLAME
<Very_Silly_Filly> RD is scout, Derpy is Solider (IMO, it's because of the eyes,) Pinkie is Pyro, Berry punch is Demopan, not sure who's Heavy, AJ is engi, Twilight is sniper, Fluttershy is medic and rarity is spy
<Unnr> ( Cypresswolf: Don´t forget horsepower)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kill Fluttershy!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Actually, Big Mac can be heavy :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<Cypresswolf> Yes :)
<WindWhistler> Is Luna playable?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh god, Walking dead is 40% off
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ugh.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Me want
<WindWhistler> Wait, who's Celestia supposed to be then?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate living with family. Feel like a slave at times.
<killerpony7733> Hehehe this song
<Cypresswolf> that blood stained mane
<WindWhistler> I'm guessing by the silence no one knows who Celestia is supposed to be then...
<Cypresswolf> Cant think of a comparison...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nittany_Discord: Welcome to hell
<AttacktheAndalite> Celestia is The Announcer, then I guess Luna would be Miss Pauling.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Celestia is announcer
<WindWhistler> The announcer is playable? O_o
<Very_Silly_Filly> Luna is RD's mum
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Grandmother had hip surgery. Making me take her for a ride. I really don't like going places.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rather not waste the gas.
<AttacktheAndalite> But given that Luna loves the Canterlot voice, she would probably be better suited as the Announcer and Celestia as Miss Pauling.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Trixie!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> how did we lost !
<Wrek> 05i like how this guy rages on about us goign rage heavy push
<Wrek> 05when i was heavy all along
<Wrek> 05xD
<WindWhistler> ...........
<ducky> i get the last point
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ragers gonna rage
<WindWhistler> Guys, is the announcer playable? I just saw a Celestia...
<Chocobunny> Anyways, I'll be taking my leave now. Might come back later. Going to play some Smite.
<AttacktheAndalite> WindWhistler: Nope.
<AttacktheAndalite> Bye Chocobunny
<WindWhistler> Then why was there a Celestia on the field?
<Dermathil> Guys, I'm off. Hope you had fun watching me blow up wrek's buildings tons of times earlier
<AttacktheAndalite> WindWhistler: I guess it randomizes through the ponies and players
<AttacktheAndalite> Bye Dermathil
<Dermathil> Nittany, it isn't a "waste" if it it to take care of family members.
<AttacktheAndalite> Aaaand I killed chat.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nittany_Discord: That's kinda disloyal of you
<Very_Silly_Filly> You should take care of grandparents, any minute could be their last
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry.
<WindWhistler> You know, when people don't know something, I just wish they'd flat out say it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01!down

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<DashWithRainbows> No, it's just dead.
<DashWithRainbows> Mostly because it's a sunday.
<Very_Silly_Filly> None of us can be arsed to say anything to be frank
<AttacktheAndalite> Okay.

<Very_Silly_Filly> Pudge: I'm 15 now, TF2 came out in 07,

<Pudge> twi_sprinkle_GS17: never heard of it...
<WindWhistler> MadSurge: Not if everyone keeps getting mad at you for being terrible.
<Sumica> 00,10At least he was't killed by twi, he would be heart broken

<pony_1252> is this a vidio or a live stream?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Pudge: its on youtube if youre interested. its about a crazy evil all-powerful applejack-liek being
<AttacktheAndalite> MadSurge: I'm somewhat decent at Engie and Heavy. I know on the offline practices, I would have most kills sometimes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek's been killed by twi already.
<MadSurge> WindWhistler: I never hung around the same server, so noone yelled at me

*derpy_pony lives on the 10th floor ^^
<OohShiny> luna?
<Cypresswolf> Im on the high side of the creek - all of Houston would have to be under water for this house to flood - the roads are the main concern - many still blocked an underwater as of last night
<Dken2021> hello, gonna see if connection is stable with chatzilla
<OohShiny> what is this my little pony mods for TF?
<OohShiny> forgot a comma
<OohShiny> sorry
<derpy_pony> hi Dken2021
<OohShiny> what is this, my little pony mods for TF?
<OohShiny> better
<derpy_pony> the most important conncections should be reestablished by now, Cypresswolf
<Cypresswolf> currently 8 ft above flood level
<derpy_pony> oh
<Dken2021> wonder who's playing
<OohShiny> Shizuka probably
<derpy_pony> not sure, probably wrek
<derpy_pony> hm...
<OohShiny> maybe it can be SuperBrony too
<OohShiny> there are a lot of gamer streamers here
<Jim> according to my Friends list, Wrek is currently playing Tf2
<Dken2021> oh look, mecha nightmare moon
<MadSurge> Jim: eeyup :D
*Shizuka 13doesn't stream Source anymore
<Vordox> Shizuka: You don't play crappy TF2 then? :P
<ponibas> hey now
<DashWithRainbows> >TF2 >Crappy
<StuffCrusader> hello everypony
<Dken2021> allop StuffCrusader
<Vordox> All the weapon updates have added mechanics that warrants this game to become more and more stale on features that ruins the game balance
<MadSurge> If TF2 is crappy then what is CoD?
<alexxm> hey StuffCrusader how you doing
<Vordox> And with the modding including in many of these TF2 skewed it big time each update
<OohShiny> CoD is deep shit
<MadSurge> ^
<StuffCrusader> i'm doin great alexxm thnx 4 askin
<Dken2021> I'm sure it's a great game, just overhype
<Vordox> Firstly
<Very_Silly_Filly> Oh my god
<Vordox> Pf2 = Unable to kill a pony, 1 pony buck up a whole team-
<StuffCrusader> i like tf2 cuz it hs humor, tons of pretty colors and it's FREEEEEEEE
<Very_Silly_Filly> I didn't know Skyrim only needed 1gb ram
<Very_Silly_Filly> I could run that on this shitbox of a PC
<StuffCrusader> how get luna mod?
<Vordox> The only thing that can kill a pony is a pyro, who in my honest opinion, has no weakness at all
<ponibas> some of us have played TF2 long enough to have paid for it :p
<ponibas> well, owned at least ^.^
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Pyros lack range by a mile, So smart players are able to avoid them
<derpy_pony> flooding events seem to be quite common in cypress
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Flare Gun?
<StuffCrusader> how do people get the pony model mods?
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Which gives a dot too, you know burning stuff that kills
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Oh did I mention it's AoE now too? Or that's kinda redudant?
<MadSurge> ponibas: not to mention their primary weapons do stacking damage or do average damage
<ponibas> uhh.. ok?
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Still pro players has no problem forming tactics to win against pyros tbh
<Wrek> 05it was already aoe vordox
<Vordox> killerpony7733: Add in team fights
<Wrek> 05but now instead of usign the detonator
<Vordox> Wrek: Not before the update, Flare Gun was single target
<Wrek> 05its a gun in istelf
<Vordox> Wrek: And a gun is...a mid/long range weapon riht? =P
<GurrenAlexander> Streaming Team Fortress 2?
<StuffCrusader> yes
<Vordox> I can counter argue anything that people say "Pyros are not overpowered"
<sub06905> all dem craftes
<Vordox> Single duo triple Teamfihts included
<Wrek> 05pyros area easy to kill
<Wrek> 05no matter how OP they seem to be
<Vordox> Wrek: Kill Shizuka
<Wrek> 05gladly
<Vordox> Wrek: Good luck :P
<Wrek> 05done it many times before
<MadSurge> TF2_X_class_is_overpowered.avi
<MadSurge> TIME FOR ART
<Vordox> MadSurge: Scouts, Demo man.
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Going to continue on the jensen pony?
<StuffCrusader> what draw?
<Cypresswolf> Derpy_Hooves: yep, that's the downside to living along a creek - all the water comes this way with excess rain
<alexxm> the pics looking good so far
<Shizuka> 13it is easy to kill shizu
<Cypresswolf> sorry, Derpy_Hooves, meant to ping derpy_pony
<Vordox> Shizuka: So what weakness does Pyro have?
<MadSurge> :) studious Twi
<derpy_pony> are you using a special irc client? I wouldn't have found my post on the web client so much later
<derpy_pony> Cypresswolf
<Cypresswolf> hearing another news chopper flying around, guess we're the story of the evening new tongiht :P
<derpy_pony> haha
<Shizuka> 13Vordox: that shizu is nowhere near as good as you think she is
<Cypresswolf> derpy_pony: yep, that's the downside to living along a creek - all the water comes this way with excess rain
<alexxm> Cypresswolf well you did get flooded
<Vordox> Shizuka: Class wise tournament play experience.
<Vordox> Shizuka: You're not far ffrom it :P
<Cypresswolf> local cant seem to talk about anything else
<derpy_pony> it's more interesting than a g1 solar storm
<derpy_pony> vacation season...they report anything remotely sensational
<Jim> ^
<derpy_pony> the flood is the jackpot
<Prick> You shall Love the *ugh* too tired mornin' my friends

<CountDoofus> Also, haio everybrony.
<Jim> hay CountDoofus
<FairysHuff|Headache> Anyone know about crop farming? I'm looking for an idiots guide book on teh subject. Very basic.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hi CountDoofus
<Flyboy> countdoofus: i see what you did there
<CountDoofus> If Jay and Silent Bob were to be ponified, what would their cutie marks be?
<FairysHuff|Headache> CountDoofus SPliffs
<CountDoofus> Spliffs?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> CountDoofus: Weed
<FairysHuff|Headache> CountDoofus Joints = weed = cannabis etc
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy CountDoofus!
<CountDoofus> Ah.
<CountDoofus> Haio Everlasting_Joy :)
<RobertRevenge> Does anyone know a good Minecraft server?
<CountDoofus> It's because I am ponifying (is that even a word?) Jay and Silent Bob for a friend, you see.
<FairysHuff|Headache> RobertRevenge Don't play it sorry
<MahBoi777> hmmm
<FairysHuff|Headache> CountDoofus It would certainly be a variation of the weed theme but that isn't very interesting.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay. Got a host mask.
<CountDoofus> I've already given my Jay pony a weed leaf cutie mark, just wondering what Silent Bob's would be.
<CountDoofus> A lunchbox?
<FairysHuff|Headache> Nittany_Discord Huh?
<FairysHuff|Headache> CountDoofus Batman, a MallRats reference
<shana> Exploding.Draconequus.Maid :D

<Skylerarmor> its another video all over again
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm hungry for cupcaek
<Jim> hai Very_Silly_Filly
<MahBoi777> hi Very_Silly_Filly
<Skylerarmor> i like trains.
<Skylerarmor> i want my trains
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01FairysHuff|Headache: The Exploding.Draconequus.Maid part of my IP now.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Been meaning to do that forever.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I actually needed to.
<FairysHuff|Headache> Nittany_Discord I don't know what that is...?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Do a /whois of me.
<BronyInstrumental> hello.....everypony?
<Skylerarmor> my trains :)
<MahBoi777> hi BronyInstrumental!

<Jim> hai BronyInstrumental
<Skylerarmor> its drawing all over again
<FairysHuff|Headache> Nittany_Discord I did the Who Is but still don't understand... sorry.
<MahBoi777> heya Jim
<MahBoi777> hi Everlasting_Joy
<Jim> hai MahBoi777 !
<Everlasting_Joy> MahBoi777, this Sunday greeting on Brony State is what all true warriors strive FOUR!
<shana> FairysHuff|Headache: it's just an identifier used in irc
<MahBoi777> XD
<FairysHuff|Headache> shana ah ok
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01FairysHuff|Headache: Vanity host. It replaces the part of my IRC IP with a phrase I choose. So, if you do a whois, instead of seeing Nittany_Discord@whatever, you see Nittany_Discord@Exploding.Maid.Draconequus
<shana> FairysHuff|Headache: usually it's a slighty obfuscated version of the clients ip (revers hostname to be excact)
<FairysHuff|Headache> Nittany_Discord Aaah ok. Now I understand. Thankyou
<shana> FairysHuff|Headache: you can guess the isp (and thus country) by looking a hostname, it's also used to ban clients
<Very_Silly_Filly> So basically, if you change your name to Nittany_Tiger, as you do sometimes, if I did /whois, would it say it was Nittany_Discord?
<shana> *at the
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It would say it was Nittany_Tiger
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But Nittany_Tiger@Exploding.Maid.Draconequus
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ahh, well I'm lost then :3
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ooohh, okay
<FairysHuff|Headache> We need a conversation topic. Chat is dead.
<BronyInstrumental> how about........ time travelling rave genies?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How about
<Jim> How about no
<MahBoi777> how bout dem ponies
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Aww :<
<FairysHuff|Headache> I shall steer away from my preferred topics of politics, social conventions, news articles etc and pic something more community friendly ^_^
<FairysHuff|Headache> Science?
<MahBoi777> Food?
<Kandarihu> I tried whoising you, and I got [15:48] * [Nittany_Discord] (chatzilla@Exploding.Draconequus.Maid): Exploding Maid Draconnequus. What's with the second instance of the phrase?
<FairysHuff|Headache> Anyone know anything about how the human brain works?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: Then the vhost works.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh.
<FairysHuff|Headache> As far as I know the medical community still don't know why migraines happen.
<Vordox> Dat creepy smile
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That second instance might be due to my client.
<Vordox> oh hai Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Vordox

<alexxm> the pictures coming on well
<MahBoi777> welcome back ducky
<alexxm> sup ducky
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy ducky!
<Kandarihu> I remember as a kid, I'd take the train to my grandparents' place. That was a fun experience, mainly because I was riding the train
<ducky> yay my internet was poop
<Skylerarmor> trains.
<MahBoi777> I used to love trains
<Kandarihu> Is it better now?
<MahBoi777> had a room full of em
<FairysHuff|Headache> BaconMane I'm confused. I've seen people link much worse than that, including mods.
<MahBoi777> Lionel trains
<ducky> i had a little train
<BaconMane> 0,5I highly doubt you have. In this room, at least.
<Shamroc> FairysHuff|Headache: your goin a little crasy dude...
<MahBoi777> even had a watch lol
<FairysHuff|Headache> BaconMane So no mod has ever linked the pic of Twilight plushy with genitals? I think they have.
<alexxm> wait what
<ducky> WHAT
<MahBoi777> they might have but they probably were banned immediately
<Skylerarmor> http://noclipmode.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Train-sex.jpg
<FairysHuff|Headache> Yup. My second or third day on this site a mod put up a link for a disturbing lushy pic
<Everlasting_Joy> Skylerarmor: So many captions. . .
<ducky> WAIT WHAT !!!
<FairysHuff|Headache> And there has been many many more instances.
<shana> FairysHuff|Headache: which mod?
<MahBoi777> ^
<ducky> ^^
<FairysHuff|Headache> I'm just confused by the double standard. I don't mind not posting suggestive stuff so long as Mods hold to their own rules.
<FairysHuff|Headache> It was weeks ago.
<Skylerarmor> its twilight sparkle all over again
<shana> FairysHuff|Headache: you have logs, right?
<FairysHuff|Headache> shana No. At that time I was using the in site irc thingy mah bob
<shana> bummer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01FairysHuff|Headache: Who linked the Twi Plushie?
<BaconMane> 0,5I think you were in a different IRC room
<BaconMane> 0,5Maybe you were in brony
<FairysHuff|Headache> Nittany_Discord I wish I could remember. But I dont.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mods aren't above the rules here.
<MahBoi777> oh gawd not that room
<killerpony7733> ^What nittany said
<shana> note that adult material is against ponychat network rules
<shana> (unless in special channels)
<killerpony7733> shana: Exactly
<Derpy_Hooves> :3
<MahBoi777> eeeeeeeyup
<FairysHuff|Headache> BaconMane I don't see how. I was using the in site IRC embed. And had no idea how to enter other rooms at the time.
<BaconMane> 0,5I think you're fibbing or you're confused.
<BaconMane> 0,5It mustn't have been a moderator.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If a mod linked r34, we'll get them for that.
<Derpy_Hooves> shana: adult material does not violate the ponychat ToS
<BaconMane> 0,5Because none of us would do that here.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01^
<Shizuka> 13Derpy_Hooves: it does if the channel isn't tagged for it
<shana> "Channels which are not labeled as such are not permitted to share any sexual content"
<Derpy_Hooves> Shizuka: i was actually typing that up when you spoke
<FairysHuff|Headache> BaconMane I am not lieing. I despise dishonesty. Though granted I could be confused. But I certainly remember someone linking that adult pic in chat.
<theduckyto> i am ducky and i am confused
<BaconMane> 0,5Maybe we nailed them afterwards then.
<BaconMane> 0,5But the idea of a mod doing it is plain silly :3
<MahBoi777> I think I remember a twilight plushie pic, but it wasn't a mod that linked it
<Shizuka> 13how about
<Shizuka> 13you follow the rules
<Shizuka> 13kay?
<BaconMane> 0,5Shizu: Who are you speaking to?
<FairysHuff|Headache> Shizuka Happy to. So long as everyone else does.
<Shizuka> 13everyone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Floaty Twi face.
<BaconMane> 0,5No one here is breaking any rules at the moment, no worries...
<Shizuka> 13not talking about now
<Shizuka> 13i'm talking about the future
<Shizuka> 13how about we just have everyone follow the rules, and there will be no problem
<FairysHuff|Headache> But now I know. I shall be more careful from now on.
<MahBoi777> I won't break da rulez
<RaveBrony> I follow rules! :$

<shana> Nittany_Discord: and it didn't work?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nope.
<Sumica> 00,10I should find the ep where sweetiebelle is born
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If it had, Shamroc would have still been banned.
<JESmith71> Hey Sumica if you're putting on ponies why not put on Magic The Travelling?...although you guys are probably going to save that for when you run random pony vids
<Shamroc> woo! bann
<Shamroc> !
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ooo...
<BronyInstrumental> imma scan my drawing for the BS art contest when my dad isn't around...gonna take some stealthy ninja stuff

<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> youtube take ages
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: i got ponies to bug on steam and skype dont worry
<MadSurge> Sumica: that one is so awful :D
<BronyInstrumental> mainly because i am DEATHLY aftaid of him finding out i'm a brony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shamroc: I wouldn't put you through that unless you deserved it. :p
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: i always desever it...but you guys like me to much hahaha
<shana> Nittany_Discord: and you're sure that you loaded the right script/reloaded the script? try changing the text minute to hours to see that you really changed it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01shana: Did that, too. It didn't change the readout.
<Wrek> 05SO FAR SO GOOD
<Wrek> 05BOTH IN ART AND MUSIC
<Shamroc> Wrek: CAPS LOCK IS AWESOME ISNT IT
<shana> Nittany_Discord: then it's probably cached or something, try clearing browser cache?
<Wrek> 05NEVER LISTENED TO THESE GUYS BEFORE BUT THEY ARE ENTIRELY ADEQUATE :d
<Wrek> 05just had to
<Sumica> 00,10Canterlock
<Shamroc> haha
<FillyFlam> MFW I think Wrek's stream is the music for the video I'm watching.
<vinylawesomescratch> Hey
<Sumica> 00,10She looks sad now wrek
<Wrek> 05sad? :3
<Wrek> 05:o*
<vinylawesomescratch> lol im bored
<Wrek> 05next one to /bored gets a kick
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01shana: That might be it. When I take the script out of the proper directory, the command doesn't work at all.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dunno what's up.
<Chrysalis> wow
<MadSurge> Twi looks more tired than sad. So much study <3
<Chrysalis> i thought that was alot of joins / parts
<Chrysalis> but no its just gone quiet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<alexxm> so what now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It must be cache
<Chrysalis> im tempted to advertise my creative MC serv
<Shamroc> ohai
<Vinco> This music is pretty epic
<Chrysalis> though not quite sure how the rules cover that
<Chrysalis> Vinco welcome to a Wrek stream ;)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01One more time Shamroc
<Vinco> Chrysalis: yeah, I don't think I've ever seen one
<Shamroc> moop
<Chrysalis> He is our residant artist extroadinaire (*sp) also, damn good with a sniperrifle
<ponibas> and spy
<Vordox> Extraordinarie*
<Chrysalis> and wrench
<Shamroc> dat blink
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It must be a cache thing.
<Chrysalis> pretty much every TF2 class
<Chrysalis> though iv never seen him as medic
<Vinco> I played TF2 once. I was not the best.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TF2 takes practice.
<ponibas> no one is at first
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I still need quite a bit.
<DerpyDude> Hello Bronys and bronettes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MP games take practice.
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord which class is your fav?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even more when they have unlocks.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd say Heavy and Demo.
<DerpyDude> Woah what is with the realistic twillight drawing?
<DerpyDude> :D
<Chrysalis> Derpy_Hooves Wrek stream
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: ok...unless you like sticky spam...keep a sheild on the dmeo
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: for the heavy the tomislav is for quick ambushes
<DerpyDude> god he is a good drawer :O
<Chrysalis> Nastacha is fantastic for taking out hero classes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Tomislav should be more accurate for being slower-firing.
<Chrysalis> not so much for other players
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: yeah
<DerpyDude> :[ YOUR GOING TO LOVE ME! :[
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord then it would be OP
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like Tomislav for advancing and Brass Beast for defense.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not a real fan of Natasha.
<DerpyDude> SWEET CELESTIA! BABY TWILLIGHT????????
<Chrysalis> against players its pretty poor
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Nittany_Discord: same here,i'm an f2p(mainly because of 1: my mother hates purchasing things of our PC.and 2: we didn't have alot of money before in wasn't free 2 play)
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: natasha is for defense as well...mainly support...
<Chrysalis> but against MLP Heroes, its unparralleled
<Sumica> 00,10both good guns
<Chrysalis> because of its slowdown
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How long does it slow players down?
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord...also unless YOUR REALLY good at angling demo nades...stick with the default nade launcher
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: enough to make a scout as slow as a soilder
<DerpyDude> :( no one aint even watching the video.... :/
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord just long enough so you can lock down a player
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Nittany_Discord: i still love playing it though:)
<Chrysalis> but not for any length of time per round
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It took me a while to warm up to TF2.
<DerpyDude> :'( am i here?
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Nittany_Discord: me too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have a lot of patience, so it's hard for me to get into a MP game.
<Shamroc> DerpyDude: your here man...we see ya...but were discussing tf2 and such
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I die a lot, I will get mad.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And stats make me rage.
<DerpyDude> THE HEAVY IS A SPY >:(
*sonicrainboomer259|b wubd DerpyDude
<CrimsonPhoenix> Should I play Alice or Batman?
<DerpyDude> :P
<sonicrainboomer259|b> *wubs
<DerpyDude> ALICE MADNESS RETURNS
<DerpyDude> great game :D
<Sumica> 00,10that's what bot match is for Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01KDR is a rage stat for me.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> NANANANANANANANANANANANANANA BAT MAN!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I never enjoyed Battlefield because I died so much.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it's funny how I was able to get my pirated save file when I ran Alice through steam
<DerpyDude> the guy aint drawing anymore, he is just playing music.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> does tf2 even have a kdr stat never seen it?
<Wrek> 05back
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TF2 doesn't.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Nittany_Discord: well,why care about KDR in TF2?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't like persistent stats.
<vinylawesomescratch> Im bored
<ponibas> inb4 kick
<DerpyDude> wrek keep drawing :[
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord...still here for any testing
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> here it comes
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Nittany_Discord: your my BEEESTTT FRIIEEEND
<DerpyDude> AND DONT FORGET TWILLIGHTS HORN! *facehoof*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I really need to work on not caring about stats.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or not playing games that punish dying like CoD and BF3.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Since they work off of "Kills = rewards. Dying = bad."
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> punish dying?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ahh
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nittany_Discord, play Kirby epic Yarn
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord i have to disagree
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BF games have the ticket system.
<Chrysalis> cod rewards for death
<Chrysalis> with death streakjs
<Chrysalis> which are bullship
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MW2 and MW3 have deathstreaks.
<Sumica> 00,10only stat that botheres me in shooters is respaun timer.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They also have killstreaks.
<DerpyDude> Wrek, WHERE IS TWILLIGHT'S HORN?????????????
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica: Yeah.
<DerpyDude> :[
<hen3ry> details, details.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's too long in L4D2.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Nittany_Discord: i play Nazi zombies and TF2 to have fun,not be alll serious about stats,just help my team and if i get some good kills,well that's awesome,but i don't really care.
<ponibas> DerpyDude, on another layer
<DerpyDude> kk :P
<Sumica> 00,10the horn you are looking for is in another castle
<ponibas> ba dum tiss
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hi, Good afternoon everyone
<DerpyDude> Sumica WELL YOUR CUTIE MARK IS A PILE OF POOP! MUAHAHAHAHA
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> whats this? a wrek twi drawing without sexyness? and a 5 pony eps the same day? today is truly historical
<Shamroc> DerpyDude: your steallin all the caps......he'll do the horn when hes done with everything else
<DerpyDude> lol he done the horn it in another layer, Shamroc
<Sumica> 00,10too early for sex. Wrek needs more shots before he goes that way
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> sexified ponies kill my soul
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If Wrek was in the sexy mood, he would be working on my OC pic.
<DerpyDude> how do i stream when he done?
<hen3ry> why does my cooking taste like sweetie belle's? :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or something else.
<Cypresswolf> What are we waiting for - Get Wrek more shots!
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Nittany_Discord: MW3 sucks. soap dies, the game is nothing but MW2 just with new modes,and IW ONCE AGAIN lies!!where are those 3 new modes may i ask?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd rather let Wrek work on Twi here.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Nittany_Discord: have you ever played minecraft? no pvp there, just a mutual attempt to survive
<Cypresswolf> :) fair enough
<String_Shredder> hen3ry: did you burn the toast?
<Ryunosuke> it is ... aDAWWWWWWable :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01sonicrainboomer259|b: Infected, Kill Confirmed, Some modes from Black Ops.
<DerpyDude> Whore versions of MLP make me wan't to kill the entire internet.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't look to CoD for major innovation.
<hen3ry> String_Shredder: nah, didn't have toast. meatloaf. Sorry... spare mustaches, I mean.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> DerpyDude: ikr
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're making games for max profit. Why do you think CoD: Elite came out.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And $15 map packs?
<Ryunosuke> http://wreky.deviantart.com/ -- if you really want to see sexy ponies by wrek, here :)
*twi_sprinkle_GS17 breaks Ryunosuke 's link in half
<DerpyDude> Murder pinkiepie drawer passes by me in town *turns round with flame thrower* KILL IT WITH FIRE
<String_Shredder> wat.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Nittany_Discord: umm,actually,there were gonna be 3 new modes as DLC coming out,but they never did
<MadSurge> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01sonicrainboomer259|b: Maybe it's still coming.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or they're working on Modern Warfare 4.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I dunno.
<String_Shredder> Nittany_Discord: I think they're finishing Black Ops 2
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's Treyarch.
<Ryunosuke> I've... heard about MW4, or at least rumors
<sonicrainboomer259|b> the MW series is clearly over Nittany_Discord ,thye main villian is dead
<sonicrainboomer259|b> *the
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01sonicrainboomer259|b: They'll make a new villain if they want to stay in the MW universe.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's easy.
<MadSurge> ^
<Ryunosuke> and from what I have heard, they have
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I won't be surprised it IW makes MW4.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Nittany_Discord: Soap is dead
<DerpyDude> ooooh, it aint baby twillght in a cot, it is twillight reading a book under a blanket! :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They'll make a new protagonist.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And they'll do it until Activision tells them to stop making CoD.
<DerpyDude> adressing all of bronystate, HOW DO I STREAM?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> you dont
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or Activision tells them to do another era.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or Activision lets them make their own game.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> only mods can
<DerpyDude> when i want to put up a live stream, oh.
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: All CoD protagonists are the same anyway :D
<DerpyDude> how do you become a mod? 9_6
<DerpyDude> 6_9
<hen3ry> My theory is this; hell, you see, is a bureaucracy. And at every level, you have a real jerk of a boss. No matter how high you are promoted, your supervisor is still the boss from hell. But so is his boss. And his boss' boss. There is no top, it goes on to infinity. Thus there is always a bigger boss.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01DerpyDude: Wait for us to ask for mods.
<String_Shredder> DerpyDude: you don't. A mod becomes you
<Ryunosuke> well
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> String_Shredder: so mods are like Agent Smith?
<killerpony7733> DerpyDude: It's a long process overall
<DerpyDude> any easy way?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> DerpyDude: hack a mod?
<String_Shredder> twi_sparkle_GS17: yeah
<Ryunosuke> looking at the history of RL events and MW series... there isnt a big list of conventional enemies to deal with ;)
<Ryunosuke> i'll just leave it at that
<hen3ry> Easiest way is to invent a time machine, go back to before FiM came out, and create bronystate.
<hen3ry> Warning: Plutonium is still hard to find in 2012.
<DerpyDude> lol, if any of you saw me whilst playing A:DD you would laugh until you crapped yourselves
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> why does a game need to be grounded in ealife events?
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Nittany_Discord: wwe'll see what happens,then,but it was confirmed that there were gonna be 3 secret modes that come out on DLC,i think BO had the best DLC,and i think that BO is probably one of the few GOOD COD games
<cratorkid> theyve been fight russia for forever
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> hen3ry: and delorians are even harder to find
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> need a new enemy just pick someone
<DerpyDude> amnesia dark decent*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BO was OK.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't finish the SP.
<Rodney> Only reason I still play COD is zombies
<killerpony7733> DerpyDude: Nope, Wait for when they ask for mods and then you gotta go through a process that eliminates others and puts the best candidate as a mod
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I don't care for the overpriced DLC.
<Wrek> 05that should work
<cratorkid> WaW was my fave , next to 4
<Ryunosuke> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, because its easier to sell if you go HOLY PATRIOTIC in your game ;)
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Rodney: excactly
<hen3ry> It doesn't _have_ to be a delorian. I've found an old-style VW bug makes a decent time machine. Except you can't really get it up to 88.
<Rodney> Zombie mode <3
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Ryunosuke: feh
<killerpony7733> DerpyDude: You can't stream everything you want on the stream, So alot of stuff are a factor
<Ryunosuke> just saying
<Rodney> I really hope they don't mess BO2 zombies up
<DerpyDude> i heard new COD will have crappy robots
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wasn't impressed with the new CoD's campaign.
<cratorkid> and russians
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Looks as scripted as the rest.
<Rodney> Me neither
<Ryunosuke> russian villians are so 80's
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: an interactive movie
<Rodney> :L
<Commander> wow he/she has done alot since i got off it looks realy nice
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> thats not believable
<Lone_Lycan|AFK> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw3667-1331797496419.gif
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MW was great because it was believable.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Rodney: if they do,COD is dead.WAW zombies were great,BO zombies were AMAZING,so i really hope they don't screw up,i heard there was 16-playa multiplayer!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MW2 was fun, but wasn't as good because it wasn't believable.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And MW2 is when CoD decided to be an MP-centric game.
<Rodney> Sonic: I heard 8 players
<Rodney> 16 players zombies? That's gotta be a biiiiiiig map
<Wrek> 05>16 players
<Wrek> 05>big
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> lol
<Wrek> 05>wait untill you see planetside 2
<Wrek> 05>LOL
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BF has 64-player MP
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TF2 has more.
<Ryunosuke> not a big fan of FPS's to begin with
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TF2 is 16 I think.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Origin, GFWL why does computer have to be infested which such shitty online system
<Vinco> Wrek: I'm so excited for that game
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Ever played dayz?
<Rodney> wait what?
<Wrek> 05lets see
<Rodney> Planetside? 1000 players?
<Wrek> 05palnetside 2 has confirmed to support 1000 player MP games
<Rodney> o.o
<Ryunosuke> Dust514 looks promising though
<Vinco> That's amazing
<Rodney> how big is the playerbase of planetside
<Wrek> 05but thats just the stable limit atm
<Wrek> 05once the game is release they hope to have unlimited player counts
<Rodney> lol
<Ryunosuke> that isnt going to end well
<Rodney> yeah
<Ryunosuke> I can tell you that now
<Rodney> so much players you can't even move
<Rodney> that'd be epic
<Ryunosuke> OMG BLOBBS!
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Wrek: is 1000 players on each team or is that map overall #?
<sonicrainboomer259|b> Nittany_Discord: when MW2 was announced IW said that there was gonna be a local search for other countries,MW2 comes out,no local search,2 months later,no local search,,and then FINALLY after a while,they patched MW2 and gave it a shitty local search
<Vinco> How would you have unlimited?
<Rodney> I really hope they make it so you can remove mic
<Wrek> 05imagine that the maps are basically 100if not 1000 tiems larger than a standard bf map
<Ryunosuke> and when everyone joins that one guild/etc, there will be what? :)
<Wrek> 053 factions a map
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01IW doesn't have good post-launch support.
<Wrek> 05oh
<Rodney> then you'd need fast transportation
<Wrek> 05its an MMO too.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Treyarch at least tries.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yesyesyes! trade my killing floor and rush for borderlands goty !
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01IW ar Xbox 360 fanboys.
<Rodney> Wrek: How long would it take to get to a battlefield then? I don't want to walk for 1 hour straight and then die within the first 10 mintues
<Vinco> Rodney, there are vehicles
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision are paid to promote the 360.
<MASF123> @Sumica, thank you for not permabanning me, it was only an hour...but I must say it was so worth it. Lol.
<sonicrainboomer259|b> no,IW are just shitty liars,and MASF123 ,if you're here,they are bigger liars than me!
<MASF123> @Wrek, are you streaming?
<Wrek> 05Rodney: there are tropships, maps doesnt "end"
<Wrek> 05battles can rage for days
<Wrek> 05dropships*
<Rodney> lol
<Sumica> 00,10not somthing I want to hear MASF123
<Wrek> 05that are manually piloted
<Wrek> 05by players
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek: Sounds fun.
<Ryunosuke> feh dropships...
<Rodney> lol
<Wrek> 05(they need a lisence first though, so that you can guarantee that they are actualyl able to fly the things)
<Rodney> manually piloted by players
<Ryunosuke> try orbital bombardments :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is it more arcadey?
<Rodney> inb4 trolls
<Rodney> h okay
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> inb4 teamkilling Wrek
<MASF123> @Sumica, well what did you expect from me? Just tell me and I'll say it...with some exceptions...
<Rodney> yeah XD
<sonicrainboomer259|b> hello MASF123
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So you don't have a steep learning curve like with Battlefield?
<MASF123> Hello...PerfectChief
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate BF's learning curve.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's the worst.
<BaconMane> 0,5Das gay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And no bot matches or flying in SP.
<Wrek> 05it wont be p2w
<BaconMane> 0,5Ah crap......
<BaconMane> 0,5Wrong room
<BaconMane> 0,5x3
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> BF3 has a learning curve?
<ponibas> lol
<killerpony7733> Dat BaconMane
<Yahooz> das embarassing
<sonicrainboomer259|b> hey MASF123 , does jon go on here?
<Ryunosuke> hey BaconMane

<MASF123> @Sumica, wll I won't so it again...in fact MLP broke me streak of not spoiling things.
<Wrek> 05i imagine that planetside also will include punishment for "troll" flyers. such as revoking their lisence

<ponibas> MASF123, yes
<Ryunosuke> I do like how EVE/Dust is set up though, there are ways to deal with AWOXers
<sonicrainboomer259|b> MASF123: Eeyup

<FairysHuff> StuffCrusader On Youtube
<Eagle3302> everyone watches MLP on youtube or gets it from Itunes nowadays
<CountDoofus> There's 2 things out there I do find worthy to watch: MLP and The Walking Dead.
<sub06905> ^
<Eagle3302> in Uk i dont even know on what chanell it airs
<GabeMoist> You forgot Game of Thrones
<FairysHuff> Internet is best for things you want to watch. Cuts out the adverts and other crap
<Eagle3302> also I have Polish TV and I have no idea what chanell airs it
<sub06905> Season 2 of The Walking Dead still not on Netflix :|
*Vinco has no idea what Game of Thrones is about
<ashka> the only show I like is the IT crowd

<CountDoofus> Eagle3302: Nah, I don't watch it either.
<GabeMoist> Eagle3302, I watch it because I liked the books
<Eagle3302> Family Guy I gave up since season 9 its degrading
<alexxm> i'm not CountDoofus is it on

<CountDoofus> alexxm: Nah, was a general question.
<Eagle3302> same goes for american dad too much steve in it nowadays
*Vinco has never seen an episode of Family Guy because the jokes he's heard sound stupid
<CountDoofus> The stupidity of Family Guy is what makes it funny. To me, at least.
<Eagle3302> yep
<Eagle3302> well it used to
<FairysHuff> I stopped watching stuff like South Park, Family Guy, AMerican Dad etc many years ago.
<StuffCrusader> i like mysterys at the museum
<Vinco> I usually like stupid, but it sounds like it crosses the line
<Eagle3302> now its just crap, they try to force the jokes, it seems like it

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01sub06905: Can't wait to buy the DLC that was supposed to be part of the game. I love paying twice for what was originally part of the $60 game!
<alexxm> is that happening SkylerArmor
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: ARE YOU OK! I THINK YOU NEED HELP!
*Shamroc smacks Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Take all of my money EA! I can't give enough!

<owloysius> Nittany_Discord: they'll eventually be able to do it without you wanting it
<Potanity> I like trains tho

<Shamroc> Phase4...that was painfull looking..
<AttacktheAndalite> What's with these trains suddenly?
<Phase4> 00,02trains are cool
<hen3ry> train wrecks are so much more aesthetically pleasing than plane crashes.
<SkylerArmor> oh... well... thats a bit of a prob- GETS OUT FUN AND SHOOTS EVERYONE.*
<Potanity> i hate my clock cuz it keeps me up at night. i took the batteries out
<sub06905> Content That Should've Initially Shipped With The Game Is Availble As DLC For Only 849.99 On Our Great Service, Origin
<FairysHuff> I like riding in long train journeys just staring out the window and relaxing. So long as the cabin is relatively empty or quiet
<Vinco> I've liked trains since I was but a wee lad.
<SkylerArmor> Gun*
<Shamroc> also Phase4 the train killed nit..
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> trains are evil. try living near a railroad.
<Phase4> 00,02SkylerArmor, GET OUT YOUR FUN
<Phase4> 00,02Shamroc, D:
<hen3ry> try not living near one, and needing to take a bus to get to the train :/
<Shamroc> Phase4: well maybe the train should of hit him...go
<Shamroc> d
<Meanwhile> hen3ry: Know that feel.
<Meanwhile> Still hate trains though.
<Potanity> twi_sprinkle_GS17: the school i work in is next to a railroad. the trains make me jump every time"

<Meanwhile> Ow.
<hen3ry> I had a couple rather awful mornings in NoVA, where I had to walk 2 miles with luggage to get to the train station to get to the airport to get home. Not. Fun.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Origin. Powered by Toilets.
<Potanity> I don't mind going on trains though
<sub06905> watch out for that Mine Turtle!
<FairysHuff> Trains, planes and automobiles stole mah babeh
<SkylerArmor> i like trains :)
<Potanity> I love the London Underground (not in rushhour though lol)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc i got borderlands for my killing floor :p
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> yeah, underground trains are better
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: nice man
<sub06905> London Underground, Uncharted 3?
<SkylerArmor> Trains like Bronies
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Nittany_Discord: i know your pc is ded, but what onlne games do you play?
<Potanity> sub06905: London Underground is a real thing
<zanon> wrek wife wants to know if she can keep filly twilight?
<Monotone> hey whoever's doing the paint tool sai where did you get the nice tools? i got it but there's barely anything...
<killerpony7733> Potanity: God london underground at rush hours :D
<Potanity> oh celestia
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01twi_sprinkle_GS17: Lately, it was TF2 or L4D2. I don't play multiplayer much except with friends.
<SkylerArmor> btw doesnt that look like fluttershy's eyes?
<Potanity> I've gotton hurt there soo many times
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did play MW2 when my PS3 worked.
<Potanity> I was on MW2 today
<SkylerArmor> I LIEK YOUR DRAWING wrek. i love you.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Nittany_Discord: hm maybe ill get tf2 some time
<FairysHuff> I miss WarHawk for my PS3. Shame it wasn't as popular as it should have been.
<SkylerArmor> i want grand theft auto 5
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> i havent even played GTA 4
<Wrek> 05music trivia: the singer of this not that well known metal badn is black. whom there are very few of
<Potanity> I go on S&D and kill dem annoying 12 year old trickshotters with model 1887's
<AttacktheAndalite> Wrek: Sweet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01All of the gaming machines I like are dead. The only working console I have right now is a 360. I hate paying for online play.
<Potanity> GTA IV is practically unplayable on MP cuz of hackers

<Potanity> i love you too?
<Potanity> Xbox
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww.

<FairysHuff> Nittany_Discord Online play is for PCs ^_^
<Potanity> i used to have PS3 though
<SkylerArmor> :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate paying for online play.
<Potanity> I sold it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XBL is rip-off.
<Potanity> to get an xbox :$
<SkylerArmor> *sings smile song*
<Vinco> Nittany_Discord: if only I could convince my friends of that.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Nittany_Discord: too bad you dont live in some slavic country, you could torrent to your hearts desire and avoid paying for games you dont like
<Monotone> @Wrek: where did you get the more advanced tools on SAI? i downloaded it but it barely has anything...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Problem is, most gamers have no economic sense. It's why they're so easily milked and take tons of publisher bullshit.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01twi_sprinkle_GS17: I can torrent in America.
<zanon> i would like to know also
<Potanity> Who's heard of TheSyndicateProject on Youtube?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Nittany_Discord: i know you can, but isnt that hella dangerous?
<FairysHuff> Nittany_Discord People are idiots
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Somewhat. You're fine if you encrypt your traffic.
<Phase4> 00,02twi_sprinkle_GS17, you give the authorities too much credit
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord twitter have been paying for my xbox live for over 2 years even now that my xbox is dead
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: they might put individual effort into a few individual cases to make a point
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Twitter?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How?
<Potanity> Man I feel dizzy now. I need to go to sleep.
<Phase4> 00,02twi_sprinkle_GS17, yeah, but when they do that its hilerious
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord win a lot of easy giveaways :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01twi_sprinkle_GS17: They make examples of people by fining them way, way too much money.
<Phase4> 00,02like the grandmother that was sued $200000 for music downloads
<Vinco> Potanity: Milkshake coma?
<SkylerArmor> im back. who missed me?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: certainly not hilarious to Get sued for that
<Potanity> I dunno.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Fuck the RIAA. They're greedy.
<GabeMoist> Phase4, didn't they try to sue a dead person?
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Nittany_Discord: i know which is why i wouldnt torrent in usa
<Phase4> 00,02GabeMoist, that too
<Phase4> 00,02twi_sprinkle_GS17, not to get sued, but from this side
<GabeMoist> Even death cannot save you from the RIAA
<Potanity> I'll stay here for maybe another 10 mins and then go off. I'm getting light headed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01twi_sprinkle_GS17: If you encrypt your traffic, you're fine.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Phase4: i know, just saying that i would not dare risk it
<FairysHuff> Glad I don't live in the US
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01People will always torrent everywhere.
<sub06905> Demopan?
<Potanity> I love living in England
<killerpony7733> Denmark is great
<SkylerArmor> i wonder if anyone knows about my youtube.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The US has a greed problem. Almost causes SOPA and PIPA.
<Potanity> No dangerous animals or spiders everywhere
<Phase4> 00,02always use https (NOT http), use 3rd part dns servers (googles are good, 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4)
<Potanity> what?
<Vinco> Don't get me started on internet censorship
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> also i remember the days when 20$ for a game was expensive. nowadays im just wtf when i see 60$ for games
<killerpony7733> SkylerArmor: Well don't advertise it unless permitted by a mod
<Phase4> 00,02its not hard to hide your traffic, which is why sopa and pipa are hileriously stupid
<Vinco> twi_sprinkle_GS17: I know, right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You have to now in the US.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The copyright monopoly bought monitoring.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like it will work >.>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They waste money trying to punish everyone for piracy.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Thankfully i couldnt care less about modern games
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Causing even more piracy in the process.
<Phase4> 00,02like some years back when they raided the pirate bay
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> havent bought a game in 5 years. last game i bought was NFS: carbon :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And pissing people off.
<Phase4> 00,02it got on fox news
<FairysHuff> Luckily most modern games are so easy they are boring as hell so not worth buying.
<panda> Nittany_Discord: well... can you really trust the gov. to do something smart? -_______-
<Potanity> Ok guys i've seriously got to go now. I think i'm ill..
<Phase4> 00,02instant jump in users of the pirate bay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01panda: As far as copyright, the govt is listening to the wrong people.
<twi_sprinkle_GS17> Potanity: aw, get better and cya later!
<AttacktheAndalite> Get well, Potanity
<Potanity> bye guys
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're listening to greedy businessmen doing the wrong things to make money.
<Meanwhile> Seeya Potanity.
<Phase4> 00,02later Potanity
<Vinco> bye Potanity
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, what about anti-piracy measures that the game developers use, like in Earthbound?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GabeMoist: What did they do?
*GilDash join dashiesauce
<SkylerArmor> whos that guy on EQD? its just a head. Double U Tee Eff dude.
<Phase4> 00,02They're listening to people who think the internet is like a truck
<panda> Nittany_Discord: eeyup... well.... >.> the gov. will be its own downfall sooner or later ^^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The only DRM I outright hate is always-on.
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, crush your soul
<killerpony7733> GilDash: Dat fail join
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Shh! :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GabeMoist: Explain.
<killerpony7733> :D
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, IIRC it makes the game very hard mode, then right when your about to fight the final boss, the game freezes and erases your cart
<FairysHuff> I hate Online only DRM. Limited install DRM and so many others
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GabeMoist: XD
<Phase4> 00,02GabeMoist, trololololo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01FairysHuff: And idiot publishers think those methods work.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it only causes people to not buy the product or pirate a better version.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because pirated copies have unlimited installs and no DRM.
<FairysHuff> Nittany_Discord I just simply don't buy games with those on it.
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> GabeMoist: oh i love that one
<GabeMoist> And Arkham asylum got rid of Batman's cape's functionality
<Phase4> 00,02its really funny when cracks for those come out same-day as the games release
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> GIYGAS AS EATIN' YOU SAVE FILE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GabeMoist: I remember that now.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are anti-piracy measures that work that are OK.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Like Batman: Arkham Asylum.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or Earthbound.
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, i think those are the best
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Where the pirated copy is worse than the paid copy.
<Meanwhile> It's tragically funny when people pirate stuff to avoid the irritating things that are in the games they want to prevent them pirating it.
<Phase4> 00,02in my opinion, only copy-protection that was worth while: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3030/keeping_the_pirates_at_bay.php
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When you make the paid copy worse with DRM and/or bad DLC, then you encourage piraacy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*puracy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*piracy
<killerpony7733> I know serious sam BFE had a mini scorpion with a gatling gun which can't be killed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01'sup RainBroDash
<onlook> what the sound &&
<FairysHuff> There should be a DRM where you have to match the breasts cup size on screen with a image that is keycoded to a website. ^_^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01killerpony7733: And I accept that more than having to constantly connect to a server.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Which is dumb.
*Bronysith licks Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When that server is taken down, your game stops working.
<Bronysith> well. im off to skyrim
<Bronysith> er
<Bronysith> morrowind
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cracked copies work forever.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cya Bronysith. How do I taste?
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: like moon rocks
<FairysHuff> May Diablo 3 die a fiery death for it's always online DRM
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nice.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Diablo 3 won't.
<FairysHuff> I can hope
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's sad so many people suffered due to the DRM.
<Bronysith> FairysHuff: may EA die in a molten pit of lead for well being EA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lag shouldn't exist in a single-player game.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But thanks to stupid DRM, it does.
<FairysHuff> Theres an FBI investigation into Blizzard because of DIablo3
<MahBoi777> booooo Lag
<FairysHuff> Bronysith Yup
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wish Always-on would be made illegal.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It would make my day.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's so anti-consumer.
<FairysHuff> Or we could just firebomb Actishitten/Blizzard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01FairysHuff: Or buy it.
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, there's a cracked article on some of the hilarious anti-piracy measures
<FairysHuff> Nittany_Discord With what? We're all poor ^_^
<onlook> trance
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ubisoft was the first publisher I ever boycotted. It was over always-on DRM.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Back in 2009.
<zanon> we need some creepy celestia eyes in the darkness XD
<FairysHuff> I like DeepSilver? I think. For the X space sim series
<onlook> Cool
<FairysHuff> It was DeepSilver wasn't it?
<owloysius> aagh
<Phase4> 00,02i basically wont buy anything unless its through gog or steam
<Phase4> 00,02valve has been good about drm so far
<FairysHuff> Phase4 Same
<sub06905> GOG?
<Phase4> 00,02and gog has none
<Phase4> 00,02sub06905, good old game
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Steam is the most successful DRM to date.

<Pinkies4thWall> MahBoi777: A winner i yous
<Kammerjunk> Well, that was probably influenced by me walking straight into the Deathclaw place in the start of NV.

<Eulshy> hey Om
<Jspang1> wait, you can look at half-rotted freaks of nature without flinching but you puke at a girl killing herself? good job glenn
<Kandarihu> Suicide is a sin because it's murdering one's self. But killing in war is not murder. She killed herself knowing that she was going to become an enemy.
*Om waves at Eulshy
*Eulshy Waves at Om
<RainBowJack> Slurry go to the bedroll and look under it

<Pinkies4thWall> SHOO BE DOO
<Vordox> DOUG IS THE MAN
<RainBowJack> Zombies
<adasdad> why doesn't she call em zombies?
<TheHoodyNinja> zombies dumb bitch
<Kandarihu> Petrified_Discord, zombies are soulless dead bodies reanimated.
<Eulshy> parents basement sorta way
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> woman be desperate
<Jspang1> Kandarihy: i think saying that suicide garentees you a one-way tickedt to hell goes against christian teachings, if she believes in jesus and asked forgiveness, then youd be in heaven. my religion does manage to contradict itself sometimes
<Celes_Chere> nerds need love too ;)
<Eulshy> Pff religion
<adasdad> Jspang1: I agree.
<owloysius> that's why you shoot the bitch
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/k8y/

<Jspang1> Eulshy: come o unenlightened one, and i will teach you the wonders of RELIGIONS
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Bronysith: :O
<Eulshy> Jspang1: Nah im good
<Jspang1> Eulshy: lol
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh jeez, a religon debate. I'll just be over in a corner.
<owloysius> i'm concerned that i won't get into valhalla. Should i join the military?
*Spectrum_Rush|Awake joins Everlasting_Joy in the corner
<Jspang1> Everlasting_Joy: it wasnt a debate, i was joking
<Eulshy> Go with Glenn, he's the best
<Pinkies4thWall> HELP! my bro is trying to show me a .mov!
<sub06905> Glenn is best survivor
*Celes_Chere brings a deck of cards to the corner
<Celes_Chere> poker?
<Jspang1> glenn eats swag for breakfast
<Everlasting_Joy> Oooh, good idea Celes_Chere! I'm up for a round of poker.
<sub06905> Pinkies4thWall: which one?
<Pwnies> X gon give it to ya
<CK|Catnap> Slurry's strategy: Fuck the old man, he'll just slow up down
<Pinkies4thWall> party
<adasdad> i look a t religion from a logical point of view. I'm going to heaven, but even if there was no god, there is no cosmic punishment for religion, meaning that being religious is the safest. unless i go to hell for overanalyzing the system.
<CK|Catnap> *us
*TheHoodyNinja stares at all the people in his corner
<owloysius> he shows you a .mov, you make him the love
<sub06905> Pinkies4thWall: oh that one :D

<Eulshy> Axe to door
<Ghost30k> Is the only way to watch S3 on it's release date through TV?
<adasdad> dat childhood trauma
<sub06905> huygs?
<Jspang1> adasdad: cosmically covering your ass... i need to bring that up sometime
*TheHoodyNinjuh stares at all the people in his corner
<Kandarihu> Suicide is always excused by hating one's self, or being unable to face the consequences of one's actions. It's the easy way out. That woman head-shotted herself because she knew that she was going to turn into something that would harm the other survivors.
<CK|Catnap> LOL
<Pwnies> Jspang1 : Lollipop Chainsaw style?
<Eulshy> Again
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Everlasting_Joy: i don't even know how to play poker, best. pokerface. ever!
<Jspang1> Pwnies: never played the game so... no
<CK|Catnap> Yeah, an axe can't break the door down, right.
<CK|Catnap> XD

<sub06905> lol
<derpy_pony> hey bronies :)
<Jspang1> Everlasting_Joy: id like to know too, i only know texas hold em
<Pwnies> Jspang1 : Oh, basically the main character is a chick with almost no clothes on, so the first thing you do is try to see her ass, but the game cock-blocks you by making her cover her ass up really comically
<owloysius> derpy_pony: hoo?
<Spectrum_Rush|Awake> Everlasting_Joy: aww but then everyone will know if i'm bluffing or not ;)
<adasdad> Derpy_Hooves: enjoy your greeting ping.

*Eulshy Has oversheilf
*Pwnies WHOOOOOSH
<Pinkies4thWall> Eulshy: if you could laze Pwnies, you were probably in the blast radius

<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: unless you can buy repairs with tf2 items....i cant help
<AttacktheAndalite> Nittany_Discord: I would try to help out, if that counts. I don't have much money myself, either.
<Eulshy> Doesn't matter, I'm OP
*Pwnies Realises that standing near Eulshy while a nuke dropped on him was not a good idea
<CK|Catnap> So I'm curious: since this is "episodic" content, do you have to pay for each episode as if it's DLC? >_>
<Pwnies> Yep
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: if i wasnt broke i'd help for sure
<CK|Catnap> That's incredibly lame.
<Shamroc> Pwnies.... Eulshy.....will you STOP with the RP please?

<CK|Catnap> Eulshy: They ARE, but the people whining about videos usually don't like the Sea Ponies.
<Pudge> Hey why does it say that bronystate is offline?
<Eddmario> This song would also be perfect for the intro to a zombie movie
<Eulshy> Well screw them

<Pwnies> Slurry, I didn't expect you'd have these as you're favs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Are the fans at least running?
<robokun> Shizuka: Try an Air Compressor?
<Pudge> ...
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, you can often pull the fan itself off, held magnetically
<Shizuka> 13i think the biggest problem is the GPU
<Phase4> 00,02blades i meen
