<RyunosukeKnT> that toph
<LightningDashFast> Toph
<alexxm> how come twilight_sprinkle
<Irish_Pony> I love Korras comedy :P
<lakingsfans> the plot is so predictable
<RyunosukeKnT> iroh being a boss again
<RAWRity> While I like TLA more as of right now, just judging by execution alone, I'd say Korra is better.
<Vordox> IROH!
<Dark_Horst> oh shit
<Soital> 12do you live near cows?
<SunshineandCelery> ._.
<LightningDashFast> oh shi-
<alexxm> no iroh

<lakingsfans> that how i wake up on mondays
<Vordox> Sokka = Best character
<Irish_Pony> now all i need is my wubs and im good for the day :)
<FairysHuff> I don't like Avatar but I'm not going to complain constantly about it like some people on here. I will pause the stream and watch something else. Wish some people could learn that simple rule.
<RyunosukeKnT> RAWRity, Dark_Horst no she's just crazy :)
<MadSurge> |Discord|: flying BISON, please :D
<Kosoveon> honestly, when I got my diploma I didn't feel much of anything

<RAWRity> FairysHuff: yes, how dare people express criticism of something. Jesus fuck why can't we all just learn to not express decenting opinions.
<Nick> tbh that's how I feel with uni
<Aurora> 6oh
<String_Shredder> they should've had a montage with Simon and Garfunkel's "I am a Rock"
<Obsidian> In soviat avatar, ROCK PUSHES YOU

<Aurora> 6most gave them out in late june/july though
<Vordox> kidzrul434: There's tons of effort and culture in this, Alot of the moves of the different benders are based on several real life martial arts
<Dark_Horst> kidzrul434: actually, the studied many existing martial arts
<Obsidian> Iroh always speaks wisdom
<lakingsfans> old animations :)
<icybeauti> hi guys

<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: or rather you express it as if your opinion is ultimately true, and your statements often get offensive
<RyunosukeKnT> she just headbutted tom!
<MadSurge> prince-dari: indeed :D
<Kosoveon> the thing that sucked though, it was super windy when the ceremony was going on
<icybeauti> so he's learning tombending...

<MadSurge> prince-dari: stream some Monty Python please :D
<Sumica> 00,10generaly when we go to stream we have to ajust the way the couputer handles sound
<Sumica> 00,10it takes a bit to do that

<|Discord|> Meanwhile: But is it a spoiler if I want to know?
<Lewis_Jenkins> RESPAWN
<Very_Silly_Filly> Obvious DED is obvious
<StevenHyde> Mooo.
<pony_193364> Hello everypony!
<sagas> she gonna be ded
<derpy_pony> a friend just told me that one of the bing bang theory characters is a dr who fan...

<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> She's in Scotland.
<MadSurge> killerpony7733: which is equivalent to DED
<Dermathil> :O
<pony_193364> True!
<killerpony7733> MadSurge: nope she lives on a full life in the past
<Lil_B> I see where this is going...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wow paradox
<|Discord|> Meanwhile: I thought everyone knew what Dr.Who/a Weeping Angel was?
<sagas> wait, that is confusing
<dinky> Stop spoiling! The'll figure it out
<sagas> kinda paradoxicle
<dinky> They'll
<pony_193364> When the very first doctor said that he would come back
<Meanwhile> |Discord|: well you apparently don't so that's a stupid assumption.
<pony_193364> Well
<SirPeckerish> What is the film called somepony?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> sagas: its not kinda its literally paradox
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/DTU3I.png
<Dermathil> dinky you're part of those who's spoiling the whole thing.
<owlicious> SirPeckerish: it's a show. Doctor Who (weeping angel episode)
<Lewis_Jenkins> It's not a film. D:
<|Discord|> Meanwhile: I knew what they where just not what they do,
<Invi> :O
<pony_193364> The 11th doctor goes see susan again
<dinky> What?
<Chrysalis> Shizuka whats that from?
<Meanwhile> |Discord|: you say that as if it somehow matters.
<SirPeckerish> Dam I know it XD
<prince-dari> There is no 11th Doctor
<dalekkahn> Shizuka: are you the one that's streaming?
<derpy_pony> poor guy
<sagas> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: It happens sometimes
<Shizuka> 13trailer for quantum conundrum
<SirPeckerish> I haven't seen this episode in years bro!
<pony_193364> YES THERE IS!
<Lewis_Jenkins> prince-dari: CORRECT
<Shizuka> 13which is an awesome looking game
<Very_Silly_Filly> prince-dari: Silly silly filly
<Dermathil> NO THERE ISNT
<sagas> YES THERE IS AN 11TH DOCTOR!
<pony_193364> 11th doctor is Matt Smith!
<Dermathil> NO THERE IS NOT
<Invi> dat angle again...
<killerpony7733> Don't turn your back
<sagas> YES THERE IS!
<killerpony7733> DONT
<|Discord|> Meanwhile: Well knowing what something is and what it does is deffernet
<prince-dari> There is no 11th Doctor
<prince-dari> Any objections?
<prince-dari> :o
<prince-dari> Thought no. :>
<Shizuka> 13OBJECTION
<prince-dari> TOO LATE
<prince-dari> TIME'S UP
<TheWeirdPony> prince-dari i have an objection
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when there were no objections?
<Dermathil> Nice use of the +m
<Pheonix_Wright> Objection!
<Shizuka> 13there was no tenth doctor, they should have started with zero
*Very_Silly_Filly shoots prince-dari in the foot
<MadSurge> DUN DUN DUUUUUUN
<pony_193364> Shizuka
<Invi> so close
<sagas> The zeroth doctor?
<killerpony7733> That was close :O
<TheWeirdPony> THERE IS A 11TH DOCTOR HE IS MATT SMITH
<StevenHyde> I'm not very aware of things in Doctor who, I've never picked up on the series, but I thought there WAS an eleventh and twelft Doctor.
<String_Shredder> prince-dari: I honestly like Matt Smith, but he's nowhere near the best doctor
<pony_193364> The 10th doctor is David tennant
<StevenHyde> *twelfth.
<dinky> seems legit
<Dermathil> Actually the first doctor was a regeneration
<Meanwhile> Inb4 a boot to the head
<Very_Silly_Filly> There's no 12th yet
<SirPeckerish> The show started years ago, there's been 11 doctors.
<prince-dari> Oh u gais
<pony_193364> the 9th is Cristopher
<prince-dari> So silly
<prince-dari> Only 10 Doctors
<Lewis_Jenkins> ^
<Dermathil> IKR, dari?
<Very_Silly_Filly> 9th doc is best doc
<pony_193364> 11!
<StevenHyde> You guys are really confusing me.
<sagas> MATT SMITH SHALL NOT BE DENIED HIS RIGHTFUL TITLE AS 11TH DOCTOR!
<TheWeirdPony> brb

<MadSurge> CAPPUCCINO!
<Dermathil> They so dums
<pony_193364> 2

<Nyria> prince-dari: Are you jealous of Matt Smith?~
<MegaMoonShine> I have to go now, guys
<dinky> aww yea
<Nyria> :3
<sagas> bow chicka bow wow
<pony_193364> 4 was tom baker
<prince-dari> Don't make me ban you
<prince-dari> :P
<Dermathil> Sagas: Matt Smith isn't a doctor. He is a decoy and a fraud.
<derpy_pony> lol
<Nyria> x3
<pony_193364> Im not scared!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wow stalker
<Very_Silly_Filly> 4 was brilliant, and I mean brilliant, but I just like 9th more
<StevenHyde> Is the eleventh Doctor considered discontinuity, or what?
<pony_193364> 11th is real!
<alexxm> marry the first person you meet seems legit
<pony_5905> Ban the unbelivers

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> time is like nature... its crazy
<Dermathil> This is not a paradox. This is a STABLE TIME LOOP
<Lambo> "We just made this up, so we can just say it is complicated. Becaus ethis is a trashy b-movie style series"
<prince-dari> I don't get anything when I google 11th Doctor
<Meanwhile> Barbetos|AtWork: when I type that in nothing comes up.
<prince-dari> Turns up a blank

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lambo: you cant kill stone
<Invi> can't they just set up a camera? :D
<sagas> What if you blink one eye at a time?
<Polydunami> I haven't even SEEN anything of the "mythical" eleventh doctor so I don't have much of an opinion
<Alchemist> they have to maintain eye contact?
<Lambo> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: You can smash it to pieces...
<alexxm> a good grenade could end one of them
<Meanwhile> Oh my god, what part of "You can't break Weeping Angels" are you missing.
<Dermathil> Camera doesn't work
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol poor man
<Obsidian> She abandoned her
<owlicious> that's really a bad idea. You don't want to breathe that in
<Meanwhile> Alchemist they have to be seeing them, not particularly eyes.
<Dark_Horst> dammit, let him ick it in, that's a fucking old door

<Obsidian> Attack of the jump cut
<StevenHyde> This is a damned big phone box.

<Airpuff> MadSurge: .. blink? :|
<Dark_Horst> GLOW!
<cow224> Lil_B: what horror movie?
<alexxm> dseus ex machina
<StevenHyde> Why do the lights matter if they can't see them?
<Lil_B> cow224 ALL of em
<MadSurge> Airpuff: Dr Who!
<Meanwhile> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I bet you can't. Everything always looks like it's moving a little when it's supposed to be staying still.

<StevenHyde> They're holding hands.
<Red_Pegasus|Spy> Friendship!
<Meanwhile> Ring around the rosies.
<SirPeckerish> Love is in the air.
<owlicious> they ducked and looked at the ground.
<cow224> Lil_B: I'm just kidding with you man
<Obsidian> Ring around the rosie
<owlicious> until someone moves the statues.
<Lil_B> cow224 really :O
<Lambo> FUN FACT: Eyes can't actually see when they stand still. Our eyes constantly vibrate
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Doctor is smart doctor
<Polydunami> Blimey
<alexxm> unless the light goes out
<StevenHyde> Oy
<SirPeckerish> They failed. Lot's.
<Dermathil> Lambo: that implies that the eyes of an angel works that way.
<cow224> Lil_B: naa man I can watch horro movie's I was just kidding brony i love you
<cow224> horror
<cow224> i think that is how you spell it
<Simon> I'll just leave this right here http://steamgifts.com
<Lil_B> Lambo Fun Fact, Bird Eyes can't do that, thats why they often rapidly turning their heads
<Shamroc> no-pony click that..
<Polydunami> One year later doesn't make a great deal of sense in a wibbly-wobbly show like this :S
<Lambo> I believe 80% of Doctor Who viewers are american kids who watch the show to feel cool and hip
<killerpony7733> Ban Simon
<Lambo> Lil_B: Pigeons
<MadSurge> DOCTAH
<SirPeckerish> Wibilly wobbly timey wimey stuff.
<StevenHyde> Doctor Who is too mainstream.
<Dermathil> Don't click the link. You will probably get a virus of some sort.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> H4X
<Lil_B> Lambo for example
<Meanwhile> Lambo: And the rest of us are the English who actually like the show.
<cow224> What is doctor who?
<Polydunami> Polydunami is a Canadian of 22. Your argument is invalid
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> Don't use the steam gift thing.
<cow224> I'm being serious
<Obsidian> 10th is best pony
<owlicious> ^3(\
<Simon> That website is legit. Just saying.
<killerpony7733> Simon right.......
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> Simon: Noep
<Meanwhile> Well, 4 things, and a lizard.
<MadSurge> Time loop: COMPLETE
<StevenHyde> Simon said, so it has to be true.
<Simon> Fine, don't trust me. It's your lost.
<Dermathil> Polydunami: you're not the only Canadian in here, just sayin'
<alexxm> do we ever find out what he's dealing with here
<Meanwhile> Nope.
<Lambo> Now fap
<Polydunami> I know that, Dermathil
<killerpony7733> Simon more like yours cause you are a dumbass
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Paradox

<Yahooz> TheWeirdPony: Whats so stupid about dari? there are only 10 doctors after all
<Dermathil> alright, now's any time as any to get the heck outta dodge.
<Alchemist> Lambo: you only live once. Thats exactly why you shouldn't f*ck it up when you are still young :)

<Lambo> twilight_sprinkle: The reason I will never play DOTA 2 is because you have to be crazy addicted to have a decent chance. I don't want to play a game for thousands of hours
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> alexxm: starcraft counts as a sport in south korea
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: dota?
<Shamroc> alexxm: cause it hasnt been reconised as a legimate sport..
<alexxm> good coyboy

<Obsidian> brb
<Wrek> 05basically killing time untill the tournament is ready
<Vordox> With some inspirational words for new players that MAY join as well.
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: are these guys doing BF tournaments too? or just small team games?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> there have been several problems during tournys in SC2 because foreigns play each other
<Vordox> Fifa had a tournamenet too, and Street Fighter 4.
<Polydunami> I live in Canada: most of us are into hockey and football.
<Meanwhile> We are?
<cow224> Shamroc: I'm just playing with you man
<Polydunami> Both American and Association
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> Dark_Horst: You can PM yourself
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dark_Horst: i dont think theres a BF tourny because it'll be hard to watch 60 ppl xD
<Vordox> Gamex: bleh.,, I was there, wasn't as fun for me as most other things. :P
<Vordox> They are talking abut one of the players of SC2, and how he has good chance to win
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Vordox: is it Stephano?

<Meanwhile> You sure it's not in an hour and 5 minutes?
<Polydunami> Wait, I know what SVT is.
<Polydunami> Never mind
<StinkomanFan> Gimme a moment I'm checking
<Vordox> "Mostly the same, "go" is a new game that's getting popular, Dota 2, LoL, Hereos of Neweart, Fifa and SF4 and SC2 will probably keep strong."
<Alchemist> okay, my attention died. See you guys tomorrow. Good Night everyone!
<cow224> Wrek: awesome I cant wait well I don't understand what they are saying but when they play I'll no what they are doing cause it's star craft after all
<turtlegod98> Fuck da police!
<Shamroc> Wrek: guessing you are eager for Heart of the Swarm?
<Vordox> The expansion of SC2 has some worries that may change the game of SC2, but they have high hopes.
<Wrek> 05turtlegod98 is makign no sense
<cow224> turtlegod98: what you say
<Wrek> 05Shamroc: aye

<Vordox> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: We'll see.
<Vordox> Also
<StinkomanFan> Is that Eastern or Central time?
<Vordox> "DO NOT BUCK WITH SWEDISH TEENAGERS; they create mods and hack stuff and make games that becomes big hits" :P
<cow224> Zergs are awesome I dont like protopes they are like a cheating swarm when I play with my brother we go 1v1 on starcraft he always win cause he uses them and cheats well he dosent cheat he just has skills
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Protoss kinda has nothing to gain
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: the live comment will be in english, right?
<Vordox> Now they are talking about upbringing and Internet for children, knowing WHAt they are doing online,, keep an eye."

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lambo: they said it

<MadSurge> UH-MERICA

<Vordox> Yes it is
<Lambo> With Day Z I think my idea of a game would be possible. Why not have a Battle Royale game with an island and 50-100 survivors? Last survivor wins. Random weapon spawn. Battle Royale: The Game
<Vordox> :P
<Meanwhile> Urghmerica.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> we need more starcraft fans in this >.>

<Vordox> Indeed
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Wrek: mmhmm
<Dark_Horst> you know, BF3 tounraments would be possible. you'd just have to pick the small map sizes
<Sumica> 00,10new fun trick as tec, put bording partys on retreating fleets

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> BF3 wont be esports
<Wrek> 05im very sceptical against bf3
<Steel_Thunder13> Sumica, you playing SOASE rebellion? :3
<Vordox> BF3 has teamwork in big focus
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> in BF3 ppl will have to watch 64 ppl
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> it'll be hard to tell what happens
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: it could work. 8vs8, 2 squads on each side
<Vordox> Which can become BIG time teamwork ESport
<Chrysalis> bf3 is definately not esports
<Chrysalis> its just pretty
<Chrysalis> poor gameplay overall
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dark_Horst: BF3 has huge maps =/
<Vordox> Hehe!
<Wrek> 05Chrysalis<3
<Meanwhile> Is the stream getting quieter or is it just me.
<Vordox> GIVE US QUAKE tournament!
<diddutz> let's take MLP:Fighting is Magic to eSports
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Chrysalis: better than CoD
<Lambo> The Quake games are still not avaible in the german steam Store - that is laughable
<Vordox> ORIGINAL 1v1 aspect of Quake!
<Vordox> <3
<cow224> I don't like moder warfare at all
<Chrysalis> Chrysalis a turd on the street is better than cod
<Dark_Horst> battlefield... poor gameplay... you're cute
<Vordox> Do it, Sweden
<Chrysalis> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG*
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Dark_Horst <3

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> cow224: MW was great... then it started being the same
<cow224> Vordox: haha
<Vordox> Oh hai Swedish
<Lambo> Is she a native swedish speaker?
<Lambo> Another girl?
<Lambo> Impossibru
<Wrek> 05Lambo yes
<Vordox> Madelisk, Pro Gaming SWEDISH girl
<Wrek> 05to both

<Wrek> 05they are now explaining sc2 in swedish for the tv audience
<cow224> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I like 1 and 2 but three was just the same like any thing
<Vordox> Explaining the game for the families
<Meanwhile> Storecroft. Fer newwbs
<Dark_Horst> females... quick, tag them. i get the stun rifle
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> cow224: i wanted it to finish the campaign =/
<Vordox> Don't feck with Madelisk...even I heard of her name.. She was one of the main players of E3
<Vordox> =P
<Lambo> Wrek: Well, the very blonde one sounds to me like she isn't one
<Vordox> Anyway
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> =/ its been 40 minutes
<Wrek> 05Lambo: different dialect
<cow224> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I loved the moder warfare 2 campaign it was amazing
<Vordox> We have about 12 different Accents in Swedish with big differences.
<Chrysalis> cow224 really?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> cow224: mmmhmm Mw2 was great
<Vordox> The SC2 montern is starting, get ready!
<Saturn> 08,01wheee
<Chrysalis> it was rather dull when i played it
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yayayayayay SC2
<Wrek> 05Saturn: jsut in time for esports
<Vordox> Now she's uses Swenglish words. XD
<cow224> Chrysalis: yeah It was awesome
<Saturn> 08,01esports?
<Wrek> 05tune into the stream
<Saturn> 08,01is that like escorts, but sportier?
<Chrysalis> cow224 but there was no story, no plot, no charachter development
<Lambo> So strange that even Japan does not have such a huge eSports scene
<Chrysalis> there was nothing to that campeign in terms of substance
<Vordox> Lambo: Indie choices and arcades.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Chrysalis: so your saying every CoD sucked
<Vordox> Explaining the different game strategies
<cow224> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I know the part the hit me was when you are roach and sheperd just shoots you like nothing and he kills you and ghost
<Chrysalis> every cod since blackops sucks
<Vordox> For Mama and Dimaimgaia whateer
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Chrysalis: lol MW 2 was before Black Ops
<Wrek> 05mana and dimaga
<Vordox> Dimaga has a huge chance of using Banelings.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> mana FTW
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Vordox: hehe overlord drop?
<Dark_Horst> the only good cod was mw1. cuz it'S campaign wasnt compeltely blown over the top and actually interesting
<cow224> Chrysalis: hmm yeah I think the whole plot was to stops sheperd from makeing a nuculer warfare but i dunno no but still it was awesome
<Vordox> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Big chance.
<Saturn> 08,01they're talking in moonspeak
<Chrysalis> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG and i was just writing an amendum which included mw2 in that statement
<Lambo> I know some gamer girls who play Modern Warfare and Black Ops excessively... But nothing else
<Vordox> Saturn: It's swapping any second
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> MW was a great game
<Chrysalis> i enjoyed mw, i enjoyed blackops
<Meanwhile> Shame about it's fanbase.
<Vordox> Prepping up
<Wrek> 05enjoy commercial free swedish television
<Steel_Thunder13> MW and MW2 and BO where good. MW3 not so much
<Chrysalis> but mw2, mw3, blops and blops 2 all look so poor
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Chrysalis: Black Ops sure had a great story
<Vordox> Wrek: What is this..."commercials" you speak of?
<FlareChaser> I am insanely bored now, so TF2 time.
<Steel_Thunder13> BO2 will be great
<Saturn> 08,01my god

<Vordox> Hehe, they are pepping :P

<Vordox> "We are waiting for SC2 finales, keep around on site and chat with other gamers."

<Kandarihu> Well, if everyone's paying for SVT, I'd hate to be an anti-gamer living in Sweden.
<Vordox> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: They ever was ? :P
<Wrek> 05lower if you earn under a certain ammount and higher if you earn over a certain ammount
<Vordox> Kandarihu: ALOT of the tax goes everywhere, it's a %
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Vordox: idk terran is usually at the finales
<Vordox> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Never seen them win imo :P

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> YAY
<Wrek> 05but "optional"

<Vordox> dat farm
<Meanwhile> FlareChaser: silly question then.
<Shizuka> 13dat steam fail
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu the games play too differently to be a spinoff
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: hmm?

<Vordox> Oh god...

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wooooo 6 gates
<Vordox> Saturn: It is! :D
<Vordox> Dat forge build u...
<prince-dari> Usually with sports it's kind of easy to see and appreciate how good someone is, and see that they're another tier of athelete compared to normal people. With a game like this, unless you know the game, and know how hard it is, or how 'normal' people play it, it's kind of hard to judge how good these people are.
<Wrek> 05mhm
<Meanwhile> Vordox: I'm just surprised by how long this match is, at Blizzcon is was domination so quick.
<Vordox> prince-dari: The commentaries are good though
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Welcome to DreamHACK :P
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Archons >>> roach ling
<prince-dari> Yeah, commentary is just like a normal sport, which is interesting. XD

<Vordox> Awww.
<Vordox> Oh
<Vordox> Thought it was banelings :P
<Vordox> Dat fail at finale...took 7 minutes something.
<Dark_Horst> well now he knows that he should keep some banelings on the reserves
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> gah it was EGIncontrol

<Vordox> Saturn: It's more....erm..unstable atm
<Obsidian> Im back
*Saturn 08,01is adding Sweden to his places spreadsheet
<Vordox> But to live...at minimum?
<Saturn> 08,01indeed
<Vordox> About 7k Kr would be ideal for minimum.
<Wrek> 05as a student you can manage with around 7-8000 amo nth
<Vordox> If you get a 1 Room apartment, that can cost anywhere from 2k-3k
<Vordox> Or you could go Dorm, which is 3k, but it takes in Water and electricity(And some Internet for free)
<Wrek> 05btw saturn if aparment maybe i could finally move out xD
<Vordox> <.<
<Vordox> "finally"?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wat
<String_Shredder> you should see how much it costs to live in Hawai'i. It's crazy. Everything's imported so everything's more expensive. Five dollar footlongs at Subway are seven bucks.
<Saturn> 08,01Wrek: awesome; i'll certainly look into it
<Meanwhile> String_Shredder: Ouch.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> String_Shredder: well its a island

<Wrek> 057000 is around 640 £
<Vordox> Oh, pounds.
<Saturn> 08,01aye; that's not too bad
<Wrek> 058000 around 730£
<Vordox> Saturn: There's alsoo the other thing you need to think about
<Saturn> 08,01the only thing is, i'll need to have a part time job while i study
<Vordox> Saturn: If you do go education, you can take student ..."bidrag" and Loan.
<MadSurge> Ok I'm going to bed now. See you tomorrow mods and normal people!
*Saturn 08,01hugs MadSurge
<Obsidian> Bye MadSurge

<diddutz> ok
<Vordox> Saturn: If you study in sweden, full time, you get allowance from the state, AND you can take student Loan on that, where you can reach as much as 9k-10k per Month
<SlurryMoon> 3Oooh, I can barely wait
<Vordox> I think allowance alone is around 2k Kronor, and you can adjust your loan , if you take it, from no loan to 8k
<SlurryMoon> 3Toy Story in 3 minutes

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: What attracted Tom Hanks to the role of Woody was the fact that, during his childhood, he would always wonder if his toys were alive and moved around when nobody was in his room. What attracted Tim Allen to the role of Buzz Lightyear was the fact that, before him, they offered the role to his biggest influence in his career, Chevy Chase, who turned it down.

<Sinestro> better there then China
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Buzz Lightyear's facial features are loosely based on those of the film's director, John Lasseter; most notably his eyebrows, cheekbones and the dimple in his chin. Lasseter demonstrated this by sketching a rough self-portrait of himself on the U.K. breakfast show The Big Breakfast and then adding the spacesuit helmet to transform himself into Buzz.

He would have gotten lost during a family trip and joined up with a sarcastic ventriloquist dummy in a search for a home. Eventually, Tinny was replaced with a toy astronaut named Lunar Larry, which then became Buzz Lightyear. The dummy, meanwhile, was given the identity of a

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Some 3D effects were too complex, or even impossible, to calculate at the time of this film; subtle tricks are used to avoid them. Examples: explosions, thus the viewer doesn't see Combat Carl's demise; hair dynamics, so Andy, Sid, and Molly all have short hair while Andy's mother's hair is always tied back in a simple-to-model pony tail; and flying water droplets,
<Silverscreen> 1,11thus the viewer doesn't see any liquid when Woody dumps his burning head into a bowl of cereal.
<Thedude946z[Online]> G3 was eye poison.
<Yahooz> :3
<Iron_Edge> DerpyVanilla: And now you have added derpy to your name?? Sweet celestia my wub for you is off the charts :D

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The filmmakers have indicated in interviews that the moving-van chase scene at the end of the film was partially inspired by the toy train chase scene from Wallace & Gromit in The Wrong Trousers. The Pixar animators considered the toy train sequence to have set a standard for action which they had to surpass in this full-length computer animated film.

<Spriggals> That cheesy one liner.
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Early scripts for the film featured a Barbie doll in a prominent role as Woody's love interest. The original ending sequence, in which Buzz and Woody chase the moving truck, was scripted to have Barbie drive her Corvette off the truck and rescue Woody and Buzz from Sid's dog, a-la Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Mattel, the company that
<Silverscreen> 1,11owns the Barbie character, declined on the basis that they thought the film would be a failure and that they didn't want Barbie to have a defined personality, preferring to let children imagine Barbie's personality traits on their own. Thus, Barbie was dropped from the script, and her character was reworked into that of Bo-Peep. When the film proved a huge success, Mattel did allow Barbie
<Kandarihu> Wait, what happened to the RC car?
<Silverscreen> 1,11to appear in Toy Story 2.
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Actually, as a matter of fact, Buzz says Fuck You to physics.

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SuperBrony64 lol is that from Ed Edd n Eddy?

<VenHur96> Shortest short ever!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Short Short was Short
<Kandarihu> The mods were playing DOOM 3, seemingly in honor of the Alien trilogy. If I could at least make a suggestion on a game to play in honor of the Toy Story trilogy, it would be Gotcha Force for the GCN.
<Big_Jake-intosh> when they say short they mean it haha
<Dark_Horst> StinkomanFan: naw, that'S wasps
<Ponies47> Back. :)
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> WASP will fuck all your shit up.

<Irish_Pony> Knick Knick :D
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> BOOBS
<Kandarihu> It's this obscure game by Capcom. It sort of plays like Virtual On, but it's pretty simplified. And it's all toys fighting each other in places like kids' rooms and city streets. It's more fun than what most reviewers gave it credit for.
<StinkomanFan> I LOVED MIKE'S NEW CAR!
<Litwick> Wait didn't they censor this later on?
<otakon> yeah, I'm damn POSITIVE that later on they made her boobs MUCH MUCH smaller
<Polydunami> I don't see any boobs.
<StinkomanFan> SCIENCE!

<Chrysalis> awww i liked burn-e
<otakon> Litwick: they made her flat
<Obsidian> Polydunami: Look at the girl again

<Reikim> GabeMoist: I didn't say the remixes were BAD. I mean, half my music is Touhou mixes. What really blows me away about Bronies specifically is the animation. Although stuff like Bad Apple is also very high quality.

<Om> Well then.
<Whiskra> Powerpuff Girls, episode Supper Villain
<GabeMoist> Reikim, well Touhou also has several fan-made animes, while they're not as many, I think some are better quality than MLP animation
<|Discord|> killerpony7733: PowerPuff girls
<Reikim> killerpony7733: Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.
<Obsidian> Yay
<Yahooz> enjoy this
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> OH GOD

<Bronysith> good song. TERRIBLE GAME
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> my name is pinkie pie
<CriticKitten> And then blood
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> lol :D
<Reikim> GabeMoist: Oh, yeah. Seems I forgot those. Actually, some of them really ARE good.
<killerpony7733> Reikim: no sir you are wrong it was from powerpuff girls
<Barbetos> And then Pinkie goes to skyrim jail.
<GabeMoist> That's just my opinion
<Barbetos> And fails to pick her way out.
<otakon> oh God
<Reikim> killerpony7733: ...I hate myself now.
<IowaBrony> I still need to get and try out Skyrim.
<|Discord|> Bronysith: I got it on console...WHY ME!?
<Yahooz> smile : D
<killerpony7733> Reikim: it's ok *hugs*
<noodliepoodlie> its not terrible, just overused/played/marketed
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> FUS RO PARTY
<Gunthler> Dat hiss
<Bronysith> |Discord|: its such a horrible game. why would u get it?
<GabeMoist> Reikim, Memories of Phantasm is specifically what I was thinking of
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> this is the video that made me a brony
<killerpony7733> Pinkie arrow
<Flutterchu> :(
<|Discord|> Bronysith: It is a great game
<Reikim> See, this would make me want to get Skyrim.
<Bronysith> |Discord|: you agree with millions of other sheep
<Obsidian> dat hoofbump
<Ponies47> BRB. I gotta refresh.
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> Bronysith: You can cut heads off.
<Kandarihu> This video is really half of the reason that this song is my favorite.
<Bronysith> Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: i can explode heads in fallout 3
<|Discord|> Bronysith: No I have played it and I find it OK. But I stoped playing it cause of the fact I became maxed out
<Bronysith> Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: and their torso and their limbs
<Ponies47> BACK :)
*Bunny_Maid_Luna Hugs Ponies47
<Flutterchu> Partien Cannon ball..... FUS RO SMILE
<Whiskra> I stopped playing Skyrim once I beat Alduin
<killerpony7733> Bronysith: draugh can't be dismembered though and some other critters etc
<Bronysith> Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: in skyrim you can just cut off their heads. fallout 3 is much better
<Om> Ponies47: Back of your back
<Whiskra> I felt done by then
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> bronysith: But, can you have Pinkie Pie armour?
<Ponies47> Hugs Bunny_Maid_Luna back :)
<Kandarihu> Man, I'm laughing out loud at this right now.
<Bronysith> Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: why would i have pinkie armor when i can have all of them anytime i want
<Ingwaz> i love this vid
<|Discord|> Bronysith: And if it is THAT bad...how did it win so many awards
<Reikim> Pinkie WOULD take on a dragon using herself as a weapon.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> so much pinkie pie
<Bronysith> |Discord|: pay offs
<Ingwaz> the guy who made this and the mod is absolutely genius
<Whiskra> Though, I did make a new character and went straight to Riften and focused solely on Thieves Guild and completely ignored main story
<killerpony7733> Dat beating beat
<Ponies47> Bunny_Maid_Luna: Are you ok? I mean that evil tree. :(
<|Discord|> Bronysith: Bethasda has standers. They would never do that
<Flutterchu> :O
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> Bronysith: Why wouldn't you want Pinkie armor?
<Bronysith> |Discord|: not that hard to slip a couple much of money to some rating companies. Mass effect 3 got a perfect 10 on game informer
<Bronysith> Red_Pegasus|RedSpy: cause i can wear fluttershy armor
<Flutterchu> come to think of it
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> Ponies47: I'm alright,you saved me :) Thank you,hero :)
*Big_Macintosh_1992 wishes he had the pc version of skyrim

<Kandarihu> Thanks, SlurryMoon
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> YAY
<Bronysith> |Discord|: lets see..incredibly glitched up. stupid story. and its mostly just a vast ocean with 5 inches deep. Very good looks but not very deep. And dont mention all of the incredibly stupid memes they made
<Yahooz> lawl .MOVs are against the rules XD
<Irish_Pony> YES
<Whiskra> I didnt even realize until you skipped

<Spectrum_Rush> idongetit
<|Discord|> Bronysith: You can not complain about the memes, that was the communtiy. Second the view is bad I know but most of the game is pretty damn good. I love the fighting and I think if you do the side missons the normal story will be ok.

<Ponies47> sad now :(
<ponyremix> lol
<Flutterchu> he
<Litwick> XD
<Bronysith> |Discord|: no. the actual GAME is what would impress me. They just focused on graphics. THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH GAMES TODAY

<RaveBrony> God, i SWEAR im giving out my phone number so somepony can tell me the awesome shiz going down in here! :[
<Irish_Pony> :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Kandarihu> I remember when the NES was the current system. Game devs were hacking the hardware since SMB1 and it kept getting prettier and more fun at roughly the same rate. Then the SNES came, and the dynamic stayed the same.
<VenHur96> lol
<owlicious> the frig
<SlurryMoon> 3I, uh, this is my Pony Playlist

*Iron_Edge cranks that bass to eleven!
<owlicious> let's make it sonic
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<CriticKitten> WUBS
<ponyremix> yoav landau FTW
<Kandarihu> Then Nintendo screwed up royally with the N64 and alienated gamers, and Sony swooped in with their Playstation. FMV became a factor and that's when the quality of gameplay and graphics become decoupled
<Ingwaz> dat flank
<RyunosukeKnT> wub wub wub
<Ponies47> WUBZ
<kidzrul434> wubstep
<Irish_Pony> :D
<Ponies47> YEAAAAAAAAAH!
<Thedude946z[Online]> Wub Wub Wub-a Wub
<Kandarihu> Well, Nintendo alienated developers more than players
<Flutterchu> GO OCTAVIA
<Alister> Hello ?
<Ponies47> Hey Alister :)
<ponyremix> wazzup
<RyunosukeKnT> that mug
<Ponies47> ^
<Litwick> Nowacking :D
<Bronysith> |Discord|: i just dont like skyrim. why cant you accept that? just because i dont like something that everyone else likes it
<Irish_Pony> :D
<Alister> Fianlly someone is polite to say hello enough
<Barbetos> Pony shrug. HOW CAN SHE DO IT WITHOUT FACE PLANTING!?
<Kandarihu> Well, they alienated developers AND publishers alike. And they all went to Sony
<kidzrul434> I WANNA BE A PIE
<killerpony7733> Alister: HI TO YOU :D
<Ponies47> Hugs Alister :)
<Alister> no hugs please
<Ingwaz> NOOO!! poor pinkie
<Flutterchu> CUPCAKEZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!?!?!!
<Big_Macintosh_1992> kidzrul434: oh boy, what flavor?

<kidzrul434> PIE FLAVOR
<Ponies47> EVERYPONY SAY HI TO Alister :[
<|Discord|> Bronysith: I can understand...but most people who don't like skyrim are like the critics who look at all the SUPER small things.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oh god 0_o
<Iron_Edge> Alister: I was gonna say hi but then you posted the "Durr durr" thing....not kool bro
<owlicious> huh?
<Obsidian> Hi Alister
<killerpony7733> Ponies47: I did :'(
<ponyremix> hi alister

<Big_Macintosh_1992> lol
<owlicious> hah
<Obsidian> lol
<CriticKitten> XD
<Kandarihu> But I'm getting sidetracked. I remember when graphics and gameplay were pretty much equivalent. Later on, games with pretty graphics became indicative of relying on the graphics to cover up unoriginal and tepid gameplay.
<Irish_Pony> XD
<sagas> hello
<Thedude946z[Online]> XD
<Alister> Iron_Edge: If you weren't one of those, then you shouldn't get offended. Unless memes are more importants then basic civilities to you
<Red_Pegasus|RedSpy> I think the stream has derped for me.

<Lil_B> Saturn ok, I know the admin of bronies-germany, and he wanted to plan a big meetup with a lot more Bronies from Europe, there are a lot of different European bronies in this chat. When he would make this, could you maybe but an anouncment for it on the Bronystate News-Page
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: you'll have to ask someone else, i'm afraid
<RainBowJack> Lil_B you are Europe?
<MadSurge> Hahaha meeting up with you people <3
<Lil_B> RainBowJack yes, germany
<Michael> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NexBwQ3sOrE&feature=related

<RainBowJack> i wish i was in NY for the Bronycon i want to meet Tara and the others of MLP and to meet Lauren would be so cool
<Lil_B> Saturn I met a lot of people who are closly connected to the UK, one of them also is close to someone who works has somthing to do with BUCK, I have to ask him about the name next time, maybe you knwo him... wouldn't have a relevance to anything... but it would be nice :)
<CCCP> id be too lazy to ever go to a convention tbh
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: that wouldn't be Pegasi, would it?
<Saturn> 08,01Wesley something
<Lil_B> Saturn he planned the meetup to be a little bit smaller than GalaCon, but therefore for free
<Saturn> 08,01because Pegasi is nothing to do with BUCK at all
<Malavolent> Hey Lil_B, what about the
<Malavolent> German meetup?
<Malavolent> Derp
<Lil_B> Saturn no, he was talking about BUCK, but i will just ask him the next time I meet him to clear things up
