<weylin|Blarg> They are more in awe withthe music thanthe dinosaurs themselves
<pony_6380> Their CGI is still one of the best ever.
<JJ> As in the franchise, not the pony.
<cowvarkians> from a herbivore?
<AJIsBestPony> Better everything than Twilight
<OohShiny> I AM A STEGOSAURUS
<[Flutterspy]> dat music
<classictvguy> CGI still hods up today

<Sumica> 00,10it's only a model
<nightfury46> MUSIC IS SO GOOD

<Midnight_Fyre> OK, so I understand cloning dinos, but how/why did they clone the plants?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> YOU DONT SAY
<classictvguy> *holds
<CriticKitten> It's way better than the new movies, even. Jesus.
<AJIsBestPony> The franchise, that is
<Michael> lovely sounds
<GrapeSoda> Theyre so GLORIOUS

<BronyBiscuitBites> i know, weirdly the CGI hasn't aged badly
<Bipolarized> Er mah gerd.
<AJIsAwesome> Tricerajunk: Perhaps I'm not thinking of how powerful 50 kV is. May I ask how powerful that measurement must be?
<Spazturtle> this is NOT CGI
<Trollestia> CRAZY SON OF A BITCH DINOSAUR
<Cruven> you blew it up@
<Bronysith> Midnight_Fyre: so the dinosaurs can live
<Vordox> Fun Fact: There are only 15 minutes of actual dinosaur footage in the film: 9 minutes are Stan Winston's animatronics, 6 minutes of it is ILM's CGI.
<Soulless_DCLXVI> Pinkie, that's not a T-Rex. That's a velociraptor.
<Fenr> cue theme song
<Dark92Enigma> Ghosties: no---n-no shit :D
<EEVERSTI> it's funny how these are still one of the most realistic cgi effects
<Kandarihu> Funny how all the cartoon parodies of this implied the dinosaurs were all done with animatronics.
<Tricerajunk> Midnight_Fyre: They simply could. And they did so -because- they could.
<MrBen> No, it's a ULTRASAUR.
<Coolbond> i have trouble figuring out if its a puppet or if its CGI'
<OohShiny> So, how did they do it?
<StinkomanFan> >It's a Dinosaur
<Blaze> Oh my
<PinkiePieYourFace> ITS DERPY
<DaringDerpy> we have 2012. where are my dinosaurs?
<Dr_Fumbles> Fuck you god, DINOSAURS!!!

<MrBen> Get it right, Dr. Grant!
<Juice_The_Human> Looks like a turkey to me :D
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> boom
<JJ> 1993? Could've sworn it was earlier. Aah well.
<Michael> earthquake
<classictvguy> They're in heaven right now
<mattstors360> We are going to be R I C H
<Bronysith> did they use cgi for the dinosaurs or models?
<TheSplixer72> GO HUG IT
<Thriller_Whale> Use earthquake!!
<Sumica> 00,10kaching
<Reikim> [19:22:53] <AJIsAwesome> Tricerajunk: Perhaps I'm not thinking of how powerful 50 kV is. May I ask how powerful that measurement must be?
<Bronysith> definetely cgi
<Spazturtle> EEVERSTI: Anamtronics
<cowvarkians> Bronysith: yes
<Kyrzar> Some were done with animatronics.
<Rosfox> :D
<Trollestia> Juice_The_Human: ARE YOU THAT FAT KID???
<Dark92Enigma> Kandarihu: so ironic
<DocSane> I love the almost religious overtones of this scene.
<B0X0R> Pikachu use Thunder!
<cratorkid> by the beard of zeus!
<Disguised> Hot damn
<pony_6965> Kandarihu: I think those were referencing the theme park ride spinoff.
<omnipotents> bad thingas happen
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: Need current to calculate power.
<Tovler> :( CGI looks bad to me
<pony_300> isn't that thing a little too big?
<classictvguy> Greedy bastard
*Bronysith carries cowvarkians to bed
<pony_6380> Wasn't there going to be a Jurassic Park 4?
<sonicdude558> Spazturtle, the CGI was all done with Silicon Graphics computers. Look it up
<GrapeSoda> WE GONNA GET RICH BOI
<cowvarkians> they used CGI and models
<Fl00t4sh41> Nope, thats not a dinosaur, thats a dino/frog hybrid
<Doctor> DINOGASAM
<Michael> T-rex!
<mattstors360> THEY GOT A T-REX?!!?
<N7oler> Grow a huge neck
<songofthesouthfan2> YOU HAVE A T REX!!
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not that familiar with kV's, so I don't how strong that measurement would be.
<Pale_Horse> "I Love you... You love me... We're best friends as freinds should be..." :)
<Kandarihu> Vordox, really?
<pony_6965> They should redo the CGI.
<The_Greener> OohShiny, fine, I'll have to give it to Sherlock.
<Tricerajunk> AJIsAwesome: Well, ampere.

<Midnight_Fyre> It was incredibly difficult to clone just one dino, but the payoff from the park made it worth it. I don't see the payoff with the plants

<Vordox> Fun Trivia: Dr. Malcolm's quip that Sattler's and Grant's jobs are extinct is quoted from what puppeteer Phil Tippett said to Steven Spielberg when he decided to use CGI and not Go-Motion. Spielberg stuck it into the film.
<cowvarkians> Reikim: good to know
<Kemy> Foreshadowyness

<Thriller_Whale> Goldblum ftw
<The_Greener> Mush, but of course any old dinosaurs from any old periods will combine perfectly into a sustainable ecology. :)

<Vordox> Fun Trivia: Except for some very brief glimpses in the opening scene, the adult velociraptors - often cited as the most memorable dinosaurs in this film - don't make an on-screen appearance until over 103 minutes into the movie. Nothing about the sounds they make though

<Vordox> Fun Trivia: The tyrannosaur paddock set was constructed both on location and as a studio set. The former was for the daytime scene in which the creature fails to appear, and the latter for its nighttime escape, in order to accommodate Stan Winston's robotic t-rex. This set required a soundstage much bigger than Universal had to offer, so it was filmed at Warner Bros.
<Welsh_Pony> Better than most zoos
<Charger> Sooo... How about we see another dino

<Sumica> 00,10stop right there iddiot skum
<hidden_pony> Yeah, Malcon... be the hero...
<Vordox> Fun TRIVIA: In the shooting script, it was written that, during the Tyrannosaur's escape, Malcolm would simply get out of the car and run away, much as Genarro had done moments before. In fact, this is how Malcolm behaves in the scene as written in the book. When the time came to film the scene, it was Jeff Goldblum's idea to make his flight more heroic, by having him distract the Tyrannosaur so Grant could save the children

<scorpilop> that ass
<Vordox> Fun Trivia: The full-sized animatron of the tyrannosaurus rex weighed about 13,000 to 15,000 pounds. During the shooting of the initial T-rex attack scene that took place in a downpour and was shot on a soundstage, the latex that covered the T-rex puppet absorbed great amounts of water, making it much heavier and harder to control.
<Babsy> Booty
<Tovler> Oddly coincidental how the T-Wrek is missing.
<Kurra> I have really small arms... and a really big head, I just have to question the thought that went into this plan...."

<Vordox> FUN TRIVIA: The gun that game warden Muldoon uses is an Italian Franchi SPAS 12, a commonly used gun in films due to its aesthetic modern appearance.
<Deadlypon3> Shizuka and they keep asking where it has gone?

<EnoughAsh2> team of 4, auto shotties, and a large extremely strong creature? its l4d3, theya re the survivors and the t-rex is a tank
<Bronysith> Shizuka: yes, but now you cant use it either
<PinkieDash8797> yeah i got no ads

<Xaiphafonese> not with hammond i hope
<EpikAardvark> shhhhh. be vewy vewy quiet. im hunten dinosaurs
<Vordox> Fun Trivia: The first generation shotgun stock was designed so that a spring loaded stud mounted on the interior of the stock locked into the rear sight. By pulling this stud rearward it clears the sight and the stock can be unfolded. Muldoon can clearly be seen depressing this stud when he is hunting the Velociraptors moments before his famous "clever girl" last words.
<CriticKitten> At the theme park, with the raptors, is where I'm going to be~

<pony_3180> T-Rex to the rexcue
<pony_4908> "So have I."
<OohShiny> lol
<anton> so have I
<Vordox> Fun Fact: Later in the movie, as one of the jeeps pulls up, right before they get out, the camera zooms in on the jeep door. The Jurassic Park logo is on the door, but it is covered in mud so that the only words that can be read is "ur ass Park", perhaps a subtle joke about many of the characters getting hurt or killed in the movie.
<Ghosties> 04I like how they play the nice sounding fanfare for the T-Rex attack
<prince-dari> You're right
<CubanAmericanBrony> In the end, the T-Rex is the hero
<pony_2206> damn, that's epic
<KrazyNoobs> Trollrex

<Vordox> Fun Trivia Alternative: In the original script, the T-Rex skeleton in the lobby was hooked up to pulleys like a giant marionette. In the ending, Grant was going to man the controls and act as puppeteer, using the skeleton's head and feet to crush the raptors.
<Dark_OOkami> we all love you to trex

<Crown95> There was a BOOK!?
<Vordox> Fun parallel situation of prop: The helicopter used in the movie was later involved in an accident in Hawaii in March 2001. In the accident, the chopper dropped ten feet to the ground, bounced back up and then tipped on its right side.
<Dark_OOkami> THE ICE CREAM
<Copperhead> I wonder what they did with the island. Did they wait for all the dinos to die? Did they firebomb it? What happened?
<Barbetos> Get a good look

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> The nightmare is over
<RAWRity> So when they get away and tell everyone about this, why doesn't the government just firebomb the whole damn place?
<GrapeSoda> :(

<GlyphicStrike> I was on the T-Rex side.
