<Alchemist> XaviortheSavior: yep
<Nittany_Discord> Hate it that LimeV is blocked in your country.
<Kandarihu> So he was right all along. I was totally expecting Jack to show up and reveal that Brent really was just a civilian.
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Same here.
<Tovler> Misdreavus used Perish Song
<Eli> if any cartoon apart from mlp deserves a huge fandom, it's Samurai Jack
<MASF123> Women are evil...just a fact.
<bronypoet> me to
<SafariMonkey> DoctoDoctorWho: Depends what feel you want it to have, but Luna shipping kinda rubs me the wrong way...

<PinkiePie40> Jist like bitches to be pretty snakes
<ScootalooBodyGuard> A HYDRA :O
<Eli> siren hydra... welp you're fucked

<Dark_Horst> ded
<Kipkat07_USAF> so amnesia gives you an accent?
<Randomnerd> Criminy.
<Metronome> Wait, hold on a sec, If EQD didnt say anyting, Would us bronies be misinformed and Spam /v/?
<Kandarihu> One would think that Jack would gain his memories from touching his sword.
<NuclerReaver> Daaaauuummmm
<DoctoDoctorWho> SafariMonkey: If I decide to I will do it to the best of my ability as a storywriter. o_o7
<cachi01> how did he lost his memory????????????????
<Rosfox> poof
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: They wiped it, IIRC.
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: it's not even that, sometimes it just seems to glitch and declare "nope, you're not getting a stream, just some boguse maintenance"
<ScootalooBodyGuard> SARUMANI JACK!!!
<Cyberlord> now hug.
<Alchemist> cue awesome Scotsman music
<Deacon> cachi01 the sirens did it
<SamuraiCanary> ...HA!
<XaviortheSavior> oh you
<cachi01> Deacon: oh
<Tovler> DOOOOOOOHOHOHOO
<Wrek> 05spamming /v/ would be the most idiotic thing bronies could do right now
<Kandarihu> cachi01, the sirens reprogrammed his mind with their song
<Kipkat07_USAF> How does amnesia give you an accent?
<warpxr> Oh you jack
<DRHUnleashed> dohohoho
<cachi01> Lol oh u jack
<Metronome> Yeah, That's what i'm afraid of
<PinkiePie40> @Wrek is right
<P0N-3> If something says "Hacked by V" it probably was NOT /v.
<J_E_Smith71> Wrek: They did right after, but the thread was removed
<P0N-3> More like someone trying to start something between /v and bronies.
<Deacon> why spam /v/? it's already ruined
<DashWithRainbows> J_E_Smith71 there were more than just one thread.
<Kipkat07_USAF> AHAHHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA
<PinkiePie40> Why give them the satisfaction of butthurt?
<Cyberlord> wahahha
<The_Si> By spamming /v/, we'd be falling right into GNAA's hands.
<DashWithRainbows> There were quite a few.
<CCCP> lol
<NuclerReaver> uh oh... they left them lol
<CCCP> why do people care about /v/ anyway?
<DRHUnleashed> ^
<MASF123> ...
<Metronome> ^^?
<meleeman> aja!...@wrek is /v/!
<P0N-3> I'm NOT going to be manipulated into retaliating against something that may not have been responsible for what was done in the first place.
<Deacon> eh, /v/ kinda ruined themselves
<Ryunosuke> the way i see it, GNAA pissed on 4chan by shifting the blame of this to them
<MASF123> Lol.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 Wrek i find a download with 10 tracks only
<Maredowell> hello
<cachi01> /v/ vs /mlp/..... wont work almost every brony is a gamer

<Metronome> U guys know the GNAA did all this right?
<ScootalooBodyGuard> The ackward moment when you need help then you find exactly what you need and your like Oh wtf?!?! That moment happened
<CriticKitten> Are we still talking about the stupid failhack?
<P0N-3> I bet the people who hijacked the thread have nothing to do with V. They're just trying to conflict brony gamers against other bronies.
<cachi01> CCCP: r34? lols? bronysith? lol
<SamuraiCanary> you DONT SAY
<XaviortheSavior> Wats the GNAA?

<Kipkat07_USAF> CCCP: ULTRABAN
<MASF123> He even got a head start.
<CCCP> :o
<WarpXR> It doesn't help having a gun for a leg
<SafariMonkey> DoctoDoctorWho: Sure. It may turn out fine. I just feel that shipping Luna can be a risky move if it's not done right... I personally don't like Luna shipping, as I find it usually doesn't fit her character well...
<Kipkat07_USAF> oh...
<Wrek> 05TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ill take it in PM :)
<Metronome> CCCP: is dat possible?
<nerf_soldier> wiat, Bronystate was hacked?

<Kurra> Jump good. That was one of my favorite episodes.
<Zompony> its 3 counts not 3 secs
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, Kurra.
<Wrek> 05hwo would ponies thumb wrestle?
<StupidSexyCJ> jackjackjack
<Metronome> ^^
<cachi01> Wrek: ask pinkie
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: pinkie vs lyra
<Tovler> Jack is naked is my favorite
<Nittany_Discord> I've heard a couple of other complaints about that message today.
<Eli> WarpXR: Jack always cheats. but he cheats honorably. so it doesn't count
<Welsh_Pony> pinkie clones could
<ScootalooBodyGuard> ikr
<NuclerReaver> I would thumb wrestle Lyra
<MASF123> Arm wrestle with hooves.
<Dashie_Dashie> >tfw you remember watching the Samurai Jack world premiere on cartoon network as a kid.
<Kandarihu> Man, that was amazingly drawn out, there.
<eggrole7> samurai applejack
<Dashie_Dashie> >tfw your old as hell.
<Kurra> Wrek, it involves the law and a whole lot of paperwork that has to be filed by a week till next Tuesday....
<PinkiePie40> I watched its premire as a kid
<P0N-3> At the very end of Cider Squeezy, it looked like ponies have short little thumbs.
<Cypresswolf> Wrek: Spike?
<AJIsAwesome> Kurra: :D
<PinkiePie40> I remember first ep of Spongebob
<Iwa> NuclerReaver: She would cheat and steal your fingers with magic, though...:P
<WarpXR> :O :O :O :O :O :O :O
<Dashie_Dashie> Fingers are canon, remember? TO MANY PINKIE PIES
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: I can get pretty complainy and whiny though, so don't listen to me all the time
<P0N-3> Ponies have hoof-thumbs.
<alexxm> night guys
<cachi01> jack just needs to hit aku 1 time right?
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight alexxm
<PinkiePie40> night mang
<AJIsAwesome> Night, alexxm. :)
<morninghaze> night bro
<OtakuTom> Wow...I was thinking of Samurai Jack just earlier today...
<Zompony> night Alexxm
<MASF123> Jack JAck Jack
<Kipkat07_USAF> I remember watching this as a 2 year old with my dad. Good times...
<Tovler> My whole family watched the series premier of Samurai Jack at a hotel.
<NuclerReaver> ..........good point @ Iwa
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: i think not
<WarpXR> Sumurai Gak!
<Kandarihu> Dashie_Dashie, S03E03 doesn't make fingers any more canon than G3 faces
<Kinixys> For Lulu, sweet thang.
<ScootalooBodyGuard> did you watch Applejack and Rainbow dash hoof wrestle?
<mishia> so
<MASF123> I like the episode where he fights his inner hate.
<Alchemist> My favorite episode!
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: oh because if iirc he just needed the final blow
<P0N-3> Hey this is the episode with Princess Celestia's first appearance. :D
<Alchemist> Thanks Wrek!
<mishia> walk in after a fun day to samuri jack
<mishia> :)
<CCCP> Hi twilight_sprinkle!
<mishia> Hello~

<PinkiePie40> 2 year old?
<Rose`wine> JACK!
<twilight_sprinkle> hi CCCP :)
<AdamTheDuck> Hello mishia
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, mishia. :)
<Cypresswolf> Pegasi could theoretically thumb wrestle via feathers, but unicorns and earth ponies are SOL there
<Tovler> The episode that Luna kept streaming
<Kurra> 640x480 does not do it justice
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: he had to hit him a lot of times before that though
<cachi01> what message Nittany_Discord ?
<Jackie`> i am a neenja
<Kipkat07_USAF> Randy Meyers! My name is Randy :D
<PinkiePie40> Dat hair
<Kipkat07_USAF> :3
<Kurra> Cypresswolf..... face wrestling!
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: yeah but i mean right now
<DashWithRainbows> Jaaaackiieee!
<PinkiePie40> Arabian Jack
<Tovler> When will prince-dari stream Jackie Chan Adventures
<ScootalooBodyGuard> no unicorns can horn wrestle
<MadSurge> cachi01: LimeV is telling me it's doing maintenance
<Cypresswolf> Kurra: :D That I would LOVE to see
<Alchemist> this episode showcases how you can tell a good story and create atmosphere with sound effects and almost no dialogue
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: well he's recovered since then
<AJIsAwesome> ONE MORE THING~
<cachi01> oh
<OtakuTom> I'm going to a concert in 2 weeks at a place called the Akoo Theater...I couldn't help but think of the show when I bought the tickets.
<Phase4> 00,02looks like steam is going to require steam guard to be enabled
<haseo348> no hackers hacked stream while i left?
<cachi01> MadSurge: what browser r u using?
*Kurra facenuzzle Cypresswolf, sparring
<NuclerReaver> It amazes me at how many outfits can be made from jacks clothing.
<Phase4> 00,02this is a problem for me
<prince-dari> Tovler: You have my word that I will next time I stream
<MASF123> A Samurai named Jack in the Future?
<prince-dari> Which most likely means nothing as I will forget
<prince-dari> Unless you remind me
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, linux?
<prince-dari> :P
<CCCP> Phase4 why not just stream it on Livestream instead of mips?
<MadSurge> cachi01: Chrome
<Eli> Alchemist: many samurai jack episodes do something like that. that's why he's great
<MASF123> Now I heard everything...
<Kandarihu> Phase4, for what?
<cachi01> MadSurge: oh...same here.....then idfk whats happening
<Spy> its funny when you say g a k
<PinkiePie40> Sounds like an SCP moment
<NuclerReaver> Sand ghost
<Tovler> ONE MORE THING
<ScootalooBodyGuard> omg lol!
<Alchemist> Eli: right, but I think this ep has the least dialoge in it.
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, not so much linux as it'll break on my setup
<Nittany_Discord> For some reason, LimeV is blocked in some countries.
<mishia> Mishia vanished for quite a bit :)
<ScootalooBodyGuard> IT MULTIPLIES!
*CCCP hugs Kandarihu
<ScootalooBodyGuard> and becomes together
<mishia> Nittany_Discord: why is your words not blue
<cachi01> PinkiePie40: you are not allowed to speak about the SCP foundation. your punishment will be [DATA EXPUNGED]
<MadSurge> cachi01: probably LimeV is glitchy and hates Europe :D
<Spy> say g a k
<MASF123> Tovler: Jaaaaaaaackie!!!!!
<Wrek> 05ermegerd my beards is on its way again
<Wrek> 05:C
<cachi01> maybe lol
<Nittany_Discord> Unless you use a proxy to fake your country of origin, you're not going to see a stream.
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, trading
<Tovler> aiyaaaaaaaaaaa
<mishia> So, I watched Wrek it Ralph.....
*AdamTheDuck strokes Wrek's beard :3
<DashWithRainbows> I want a lookie at it, Wrek.
<P0N-3> If ya can't stand the heat, get outta the future.
<Kandarihu> Phase4, I see
<Nittany_Discord> mishia: I was chatting in another channel that doesn't like colors.
<PinkiePie40> Someone get the Dyson! and SCP IS AFTER ME!
*Kandarihu hugs CCCP
<mishia> Nittany_Discord: ah
<DashWithRainbows> Let me see your viking beard blossom!
<Eli> Alchemist: while i love to watch stuff like mlp for the story, i watch samurai jack mostl for the animation. this show is just great with styles and kinds of stroy telling
<Kipkat07_USAF> Wrek: I just started shaving today
<MASF123> Tovler: Magic must defeat MAGIC.
<Wrek> 05hell naw ima gona shave untill the blind spot gets some colo
<ScootalooBodyGuard> JACK!!! IS IT THE END!?!?!
<NuclerReaver> Welcome to Elsewhere, Home of the Khajiit, Skooma and sand ghosts.
<Tovler> bad day bad day bad day!
<OtakuTom> I've been growing a beard over the last 5 or 6 weeks...the security guard where I work is calling me Grizzly Adams now XD

<DerpyMuffins> Jack monking it
<ScootalooBodyGuard> the end
<mishia> Gonna say now, the movie is defintly worth a watch.
<Kipkat07_USAF> oh god this makes me sad... that acceptance of death...
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_USAF: he didnt accept it, he jsut realized theyre mirages
<Kurra> Illusions....
<Kipkat07_USAF> LOL
<cachi01> i was the only one laughing at the reference...
<P0N-3> Mirages sure aren't wet!
<ScootalooBodyGuard> Fall...

<DerpyMuffins> It's a trap
<Kurra> ANyone else would WHOOHOO, Jack just c:

<mishia> Oh!
<Wrek> 05i was instantly reminded of monthy python when i saw that leaf
<Zacklego> "Umad HorseFuckers?" Nope. Because irony is magic.
<Eli> i don't think it works like this...
<Kipkat07_USAF> I remember this
<SamuraiCanary> XD
<mishia> Did you like it as well?<3
<cachi01> of course i did!
<Tovler> oh Jackie Chan Adventures, there are still like 5 seasons of you that I haven't seen.
<Iwa> Evil scientist, at work :)
<Saturn> 08,01honestly, i thought the hack was rather amusing
<cachi01> i watched the premiere :3
<Metronome> ^
<ScootalooBodyGuard> Is that a evil weirdo scientist
<Eli> Zacklego: if you're not mad just let it go. forget about it
<SamuraiCanary> The precioussssss
<morninghaze> wtf
<Saturn> 08,01it was more a minute of inconvenience than anything else
<mishia> Did not expect it to be that good, they advertised it the wrong way :P
<NuclerReaver> His leaf monster will end us all
<Kipkat07_USAF> Saturn: Laugh at their failure

<MASF123> That sound...
<Kipkat07_USAF> ded
<CCCP> Eli that's starting to sound like patriotism
<J_E_Smith71> Unless the posion purifed the drinking water and made it better
<P0N-3> It's probably healthier than Coke.
<Eli> CCCP: what?
<twilight_sprinkle> ded, show over, aku wins
<Nyst> I think he heard the sweat drop fall.
<Kipkat07_USAF> P0N-3: probably
<Tovler> Still beats Bud American Ale
<Eli> CCCP: are you crazy?
<SamuraiCanary> This "scientist" is giving me the willies.

<Eli> CCCP: ... don't do sarcasm over the internet. just don't. i speak from experience
<P0N-3> I feel bad for these guys.
<PinkiePie40> SWEDISH PEOPLE!
<Wrek> 054 seasons
<P0N-3> All this work and it doesn't amount to much.
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[School: 2001-2004
<Kipkat07_USAF> Dundundundun DUN
<NuclerReaver> Rairity's crystal mine?
<SpadeMagnes[School> It kind of ended poorly it just kind of...died
<CCCP> Eli it totally works though
<MadSurge> I just want to see it so I can finally understand who the hell is this Turbo guy that keeps popping out everywhere
<Zacklego> And thats how eridium is mined!
<Eli> CCCP: if you have trolling in mind...
<P0N-3> I feel sooo bad for these guys lol.
<fr4nky1> it totally needs a reboot
<mishia> The movie, or what it's based on?
<Iwa> Eli and CCCP: Poe's Law :)
<MASF123> I need to counter-troll trolling brony any suggestions?
<AJIsAwesome> MASF123: Ignoring them?
<SpadeMagnes[School> How about, ignore them
<MASF123> noooooo!
<cachi01> ^^
<Tovler> I figured out the theme for these 4 short graybles!
<twilight_sprinkle> eyjey thats the boring way
<PinkiePie40> Rarity WHAT DID THEY DO?
<CCCP> Poe's law states: Without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is impossible to create a parody of fundamentalism that someone won't mistake for the real thing.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: But efficient. :3
<SpadeMagnes[School> Trolling them is just doing the same thing they did..
<fr4nky1> epic soundtrack
<cachi01> sending sprunkls to their HQ
<SamuraiCanary> Whoa.
<MASF123> That would be the SMART thing to do. I am not known for that. AJIsAwesome
<PinkiePie40> brb dinner
<Kandarihu> MASF123, love and tolerate is the brony tradition.
<Metronome> I Would Annoy the troll
<SpadeMagnes[School> You would be as bad as them if you stooped to trolling them
<AJIsAwesome> Dat Dragon.
<MASF123> Yeah but 3/4 don't follow it.
<Iwa> MSF123: To counter a troll, ignore them. To counter-troll a troll, be oblivious to their trolling no matter what but don't react directly, till the extreme
<P0N-3> Don't google Bad Dragon!
<cachi01> but its an awesome store!!!
*Kipkat07_USAF googles it
<Tovler> grond
<MadSurge> Who he is, mostly
<Kurra> GAH-BWAH-BWAAAAAGH
<P0N-3> Oh... my.
<MadSurge> Yeah, the movie
<MASF123> Iwa....Press TAB on MAS to get my name faster.
*Kipkat07_USAF faints
<MadSurge> It's not out here yet :|
<Eli> poe's law also makes it easy, to "pretend to have been kidding the whole time"
<Kandarihu> Iwa, that sounds like a good policy.
<MASF123> It works for any other member too.
<Kurra> Draw! Draw! Draw! Draw!
<P0N-3> Ya bloody ponehs!
<SpadeMagnes[School> I have a question, what can knock out your conenction to the internet?
<SamuraiCanary> Bonk.
<SpadeMagnes[School> Today my internet seems to die randomly
<MASF123> Lol. Bink.
<U_MAD_HORSEFUCKERS> COOL
<MASF123> Bonk
<twilight_sprinkle> dat nick lel
<Kurra> I'm not even winded.
<mishia> "Turbo" refers to a racing game main charcter in the movie whom always had attention. When a new racing game popped up and gathered all the children who where visting the arcade, Turbo became jelous. He left his game during the night and entered the new game, and tryed to take it over.

<SpadeMagnes[School> Kandarihu: I'd have to ask my dad... maybe something wrong with it
<Zacklego> because the modum is the thing that controls the internet
<P0N-3> They've been through such hell for this sword and warrior.

<morninghaze> totally bangable
<Kandarihu> She keeps calling him "young servant"
*Alchemist is relaxed
<SamuraiCanary> Aw.

<DerpyMuffins> Was that really Celestia?
<Nyst> Jack was tired, it was the only reason he'd agree to rest.
<SamuraiCanary> Nah
<Dashie_Dashie> Celestia's cameo.
<Kurra> StupidSexyCJ: We'll share a drink, have a few laaughs...
<cachi01> was that nicole?
<AJIsAwesome> Doubt it, DerpyMuffins.
<Dashie_Dashie> HUMANIZED CELESTIA
<P0N-3> Goddess of the sun became lonely. The lone samurai spurned her company, and the only other sentient creatures were ponies...
<Kandarihu> DerpyMuffins, no.
<Tovler> Celestia was the voice of that purple dog?
<Nyst> As soon as he was rested, his destiny yanked him back.
<SpadeMagnes[School> Did this show ever have a conclusive ending? Didnt it just end apprubtly?
<Alchemist> no, it wasnt nicole oliver
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Kandarihu http://derpy.me/cdUMH

<Kandarihu> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, lol
<Kipkat07_USAF> Aku is voiced by Mako the guy who voices Iroh in Avatar
<Tovler> Jack vs The Undead?
<Nyst> He ran out of there with renewed energy. I'd say that's what a good rest does.
<americans_are_hipste> this intro is just fabulous
<MASF123> Aku is a coward.
<Alchemist> This was the Spring fairy's VA http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0217221/
*Kurra blows his mane out of the way, fhoo.
<Azuredragon> R.I.P Mako
<SamuraiCanary> HA TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<SpadeMagnes[School> Who voiced Jack anyway?
<Tovler> They need to get the guy who voices the new Splinter in TNMT
<Zacklego> http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTBEcAFVoTyr41U8O8_XOIIHprkm4Vfu1jGNUcpqsbmf24t3YYZThOti1A_
<P0N-3> Aku knows Jack can defeat him.
<J_E_Smith71> SpadeMagnes[School: Phill LaMarr
<IshPonyPonyThePony> I have potentially important information regarding the hacking
<morninghaze> ok
<Dark_Horst> Zacklego: dont think that's jack. is insignia is different
<SamuraiCanary> OH THIS ONE.
<mishia> Erm.... The creatures that was based on is a lonley spirit which can only provide god's pleasures, and hopes to keep the compony untill they perish. The food they give provides the nurishment to survive, but is a drug that causes time to become worthless to the one who eats it, and the person will happily engage in pleasure.
<Kinixys> Is there a new TMNT?
<SamuraiCanary> Da mafia.
<MASF123> The SOurce of Wtaer episode?
<Kipkat07_USAF> P0N-3: hes a pussy. he sends his enemnies away

<PinkiePie40> And then there was space
<PinkiePie40> http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread901900/pg1
<CrystalPhoenix> Hevay_Ballerina, why would I give out something bad?
<SpadeMagnes[School> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uurupmBurBM&feature=relmfu I love this remix of the Hoenn Champion battle theme

<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's the spiritual successor to Melty Blood
<CrystalPhoenix> Screencap, space stock picture

<CrystalPhoenix> correction
<CrystalPhoenix> vector

<pinkiebrony> IM DONE FINALLY
<pinkiebrony> I DID IT

<oni_link|laundry> Bronysith: friends did that with MVC3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hmm, I guess Blazblue Continuum Shift 2 was the one that didn't quite live up to the hype
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: bah don't worry the later chapters are empty and frustrating as hell I hope you didn't buy that game for your own sake
<pinkiebrony> I MADE ALL THE MLP SONG 12 BIT OR WHAT EVER ITS CALLED
<pinkiebrony> SON GS
<oni_link|laundry> >:I
<CrystalPhoenix> lol 12 bit?
<CrystalPhoenix> that doesn't exist

<Bronysith> SaxyPretender: and which tekken game is your fav?
<Kipkat07_USAF> I could simulate this game. All I need are some shrooms

<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: dont worry, got a guidebook here to help me with them
<oni_link|laundry> wish i knew the name of this one too :|
<Kurra> I could simulate this game. All I need is a concrete form and all the Home Depot spraypaint.
<pinkiebrony> i meant 4chan
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: seriously you should have rented it, I nearly got 100% in only 30 hours and that's bc I didn't want to replay one mission since I played through it at like 3 am
<Blaze> Oohh...
<Bronysith> SaxyPretender: typical grouping in UMvC3? who you use most?

<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: you would have been better with AC2, the best game in the series if you ask me
<twilight_sprinkle> gagagagagagaben
<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: course, that is your opinion
<Mesh> I sort of want MvC2 for the Dreamcast but it's really expensive
<pinkiebrony> meh i got nothing else
<Mesh> The Xbox version is cheaper (whenever I see that used whcih is like never) but apparently less accurate?
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: plus it's cheaper, but goddamn the Naval battles of AC3 are awesome. Seriously if you really like AC3 so much, pick up AC2 when you can
<SaxyPretender> 0,14wait, is this toohoo musics?
<Bronysith> SaxyPretender: and finally, favorite sandwich?
<CrystalPhoenix> Mesh, isn't there a re-release of that in 360 PS3?

<CrystalPhoenix> SaxyPretender, yes
<Buytoast> TOOHOO?!
<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: i know, the naval battles are FUCKING AWESOME

<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Mesh: It was on PS2, so it might be on Xbox, too
<CrystalPhoenix> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACEW
<SpadeMagnes[School> What?
<Mesh> I think I heard the PS2 port was bad? idk
<Blaze> SPAAAAAACE!
<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: there was this one side quest that fried my mind, not from frustration, but from sheer WAT
<pinkiebrony> so slow
<Gasoline> Like 20 minutes
<pinkiebrony> i mean long
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Idk, I had the PS2 version and it was okay
<Mesh> And no real desire to own a 360 or PS3 since they sound sort of useless without XBLA or PSN accounts, also I hear you basically need HD TVs for them, and I donm't really want an HD TV
<Bronysith> huh
<d3rb> wha?
<Kurra> Yes.
<Kurra> Yes I do.
<Blaze> Hey, I have a theroy for the hacker/s! It might be bronies who wanted revenge for that meme that must not be named!

<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: that side quest involved a certain horseman
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: yeah well it gets worse. The penultimate mission suffers from horrible glitches and randomness to get the optional objectives. I had to replay it over 20 times before I got it 100%
<oni_link|laundry> Mesh: not really true. they come with composite cables
<Kurra> Yeahyeahyeh!
<Kurra> Whoa
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: bah that was easy
<Meanwhile> Blaze: Your theory is bad. Shush.
<Buytoast> you're thoery is wrong Blaze
<Blaze> Okay....
<jojoyasmin> I feel like I would die if I tried playing this game.
<SpadeMagnes[School> Why do PC versions of games always seem better?
<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: no, i mean the outcome of it was surprising
*Blaze sits in the corner
<Kipkat07_USAF> shot down
<pinkiebrony> thoery is so wrong
<d3rb> Blaze, theyre just tools, best to ignore and move on
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School: more buttons
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: oh
<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: i mean, i NEVER expected the Headless Horseman to be there
<SpadeMagnes[School> Bronysith: Mods?
<Blaze> Got it.
<d3rb> :)
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: oh yeah me neither actually
<Kipkat07_USAF> shot down like a triplane vs a SAM missile
<oni_link|laundry> SpadeMagnes[School: because you spend more on hardware, more buttons, more accuracy if you go with mouse and keyboard
<pinkiebrony> almost doooone
<oni_link|laundry> and it looks better
<SpadeMagnes[School> Also Mods add shit
<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: made me go full WAT
<oni_link|laundry> ^^
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School: and also games are designed on the computer, but doesnt matter how a game looks, it is how it plays
<oni_link|laundry> mods too
<Mesh> Dude.
<Mesh> Waiter at the restaurant today called me "young man"
<Mesh> I'm pretty sure I was older than him.
<pinkiebrony> song over YAY ALMOST THERE
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: how about the reveal at the end of the prologue?
<oni_link|laundry> Mesh: lol
<Kurra> Uhoh did Shazooka hit a gray block?
<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: that made me go HOLYSHITWTFBBQJOPHFAL:KSJAOPIHGF
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: yeah me too basically
<SpadeMagnes[School> Hey cousin lets go bowling!
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School: die
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: didn't see it coming and they never really explain it either on WHY they were able to do that stuff.
<pinkiebrony> WAITER CALLED MY FRIEND MA'AM
<oni_link|laundry> SpadeMagnes[School: sorry Roman, Im too busy getting shot
<SpadeMagnes[School> Pootis
<oni_link|laundry> another time, maybe?
<pinkiebrony> I SLAPPED THAT MARTINI OUT OF THIS HAND
<Kurra> penser heere
<FlutterMEDIC> otakon: possibly for their own goals? rejection of the old ways?
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: also, if you want to make a LOT of money, ship Beaver pelts out on the convoys.
<Kipkat07_USAF> I had a dream last night that the mods took me and made me a mod. Best dream ever.
<NocturnalBlade> goood evening everypony :)
<otakon> FlutterMEDIC: who knows? but enough of that
<Meanwhile> Your life must be very dull.

*NocturnalBlade hugs otakon and d3rb

<FlutterMEDIC> any reaction to Kipkat07_USAF licking your mane, BaconMane?
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: yellow quiet too boring to be any good

<RaveBrony> LMAO!! This song
<Buytoast> shit man this music makes me want to put on some motley and prace about on a rolling keg in a colofully festive street
<Buytoast> hot damn
<KrazyNoobs> Now that I have gotten my degree in Marine Biology, I can now start to do some pony projects, perhaps a game. I came here for suggestions. Any game I should ponify?
<Tovler> so the little finger is called a pinky in US but pinkie in UK?
<KrazyNoobs> I have no use for my time, so pony is now my priority
<Buytoast> here's an idea
<HavokOC> Ello
<Buytoast> don't ponify anything
<shizumobile> If not for that grey
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i thought you didn't like ninja mono shizu
<Buytoast> and make something original
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder if the guy who uploaded swaggity swag was the one of the guys who did the hack
<KrazyNoobs> Okay, how about an RPG?
<Shizuka> moment
<Tovler> team up with a genetic engineer to create a real-life sea pony.
<Kandarihu> KrazyNoobs, I'd like to see Grand Theft Auto IV ponified.
<twilight_sprinkle> KrazyNoobs: dont listen to him,ponify something if you want to, many bronies would probably enjoy it
<KrazyNoobs> Okay, I'd rather do an RPG.
<KrazyNoobs> WHere you level up and get stronger. Thanks guise!
<Shizuka> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I am coming for you
<KrazyNoobs> Any ideas for a battle system? I want to make it complex.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> :p
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh snap
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's on
<Shizuka> but also to give chat something new
<SaxyPretender> 0,14like Donkey Kong
<Shizuka> as i've never played any of these on ninja
<twilight_sprinkle> KrazyNoobs: well thinking up a rpg system will take some time
<KrazyNoobs> Should I do a ponified Pokemon?
<Buytoast> make the enemies attack you in sync with the music's beats
<Buytoast> if you do that
<twilight_sprinkle> KrazyNoobs: theres already a ponified pokemon game
<Buytoast> i'll forgive you for ponifyin something
<KrazyNoobs> Dayum.
<Stallion_of_War> Shizupony is best Shizupony
<Kurra> Watching the game in negative like this makes me want to go snowboarding
<KrazyNoobs> Ponified legend of zelda?
<Buytoast> because nothing is cooler shit than watching enemies dance and boogie to the fight theme
<DRHUnleashed> bass
*Kipkat07_USAF 's ears melt from the bass
<Kurra> Link would be a donkey, with the long ears no?
<KrazyNoobs> I am coming up with ideas, I'll be back in a moment.
<KrazyNoobs> Have any of you played Mario RPG, such as Partners in Time, Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga or Bowser's Inside Story? I ponified verson of that would be epic and amazing! :D
<shizumobile> Ow
<oni_link|laundry> Kurra: A donkey? really? IDK :I and Epona would remain unchanged XD maybe with a carrot for a cutie mark though lol
<Zacklego> You know what would be nice? Lets all play Mario hotel
<twilight_sprinkle> never been a fan of mario game personally
<oni_link|laundry> NO
<J_E_Smith71> KrazyNoobs: All three of em
<oni_link|laundry> KrazyNoobs: that would be cool
<Buytoast> don't you dare defile the handheld mario and luigi RPGS
<Buytoast> i swear
<oni_link|laundry> haha
<Kurra> Epona would have to be like, a giant Hercules beetle or something really unbelievable
<RaveBrony> I never really played Mario O.o
<KrazyNoobs> Defile? No, it will not BE them, it will be like them, with fun battle systems.
<Buytoast> as long as you don't touch the games or anything they contain
<KrazyNoobs> To tell you the truth, only Earthbound and Mario RPG have ever sucked in hours and hours of my time with gameplay. If I can ponify them, bronies that have played them will find it exciting.
<J_E_Smith71> KrazyNoobs: How's this for you? http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/217/9/6/pinkie_and_fluttershy__discord__s_inside_story_by_nickyv917-d59xsta.png
<twilight_sprinkle> well if i ever decide to defile i game, i now know what to lel
<KrazyNoobs> COOL
<oni_link|laundry> Kurra: lol she can be a giant venomous moth
<Buytoast> NO
<Buytoast> boy, this makes me livid
<RaveBrony> ??
<KrazyNoobs> It already has been thought up of. Ponified Earthbound, anyone?
<J_E_Smith71> Buytoast: The song or the pic?
*Kipkat07_USAF melts from the bass
<Buytoast> that picture
<oni_link|laundry> guys, you found Buytoast's ticker
<Buytoast> the song aint too bad
<RaveBrony> Ikr? THe bass is great :D
<Shizuka> that... sucked...
<RaveBrony> D:
<Shizuka> but i can do better...

<RaveBrony> then it hit me
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> omg.. STOP PUTTING DOWNLOAD LINKS

<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Wait wat?
<RaveBrony> XylemTube: Look up Swiggity Swag on youtube
<HoodyNinja> And thats why I don't watch the live eps :I
<Kurra> Do these people not realize that if stream ever gets interrupted, we just start drawing/making music/remixing stuff/creating FiW stuff? :p
<Petrified_Discord> oh lol found the hack in this morning's episode
<sumica> 00,10Nice of them to fall for it

<Petrified_Discord> But you can backtrace him, right?
<HoodyNinja> Gettin a little worrisome
<Herostar_Returned> so wait, that was or wasn't a counter hack?
<PrincessLuna> hiya AdamTheDuck
<JRP2234|Zzz> mica trolol
*Kurra is so glad he can go places where hijacking is impossible
<HoodyNinja> Oi PrincessLuna
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja they can only do it with mips though
<RaveBrony> sumica: Have they been constantly trying to today? O.o
<bluestroms1> bronystate hacked?

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> refresh
<superretroworld> im sorry but i still cant get over how good Cheer On was, ive had more respect for reading
<MirrorImage> bluestroms1 - nah. the stream was hijacked. the website itself wasn't
<AdamTheDuck> JRP2234, did you seriously just wake up at 17:00 in the afternoon?
<bluestroms1> ahh
<Rose`> mrow
<JRP2234> no
<Tovler> I was too busy raging at the lack of Derpy to notice the hacking or the Dr. Who/Hooves reference
<HoodyNinja> fucking lime v
<JRP2234> i forgot to cahnge me nick

<ShiningDawn> i love this
<Shizuka> oi
<Kurra> I think i'm going biking tomorrow
<Shizuka> 13settle down
<Synapsis> http://lolerstream.com/ hijacked the stream guys
<Tovler> A decent number of people didn't notice since they can't tell Derpy and Cloud Kicker apart.
<Errizaria> Kurra: Do you have a route, or just go as you would?
<RaveBrony> http://derpy.me/mKxWn
<MahBoi777> Herostar_Returned: what do you mean? did something happen?
<twilight_sprinkle> lolerstream spam dont seem legit
<J_E_Smith71> So they decide to hijack again when its 1 AM when its just the regulars here don't give a dang. Sure during the new ep it was one thing since it was packed and more people would freak out, but we know better
<Kurra> I'd randomly go.
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> so why are we freaking out about this?
<Shizuka> 13refresh and hit play
<Kurra> Errizaria, yay immune to internets out there! :D
<HoodyNinja> I did that twice
<Yahooz> so i heard they got us again
<HoodyNinja> Oh there it go
<JRP2234> ad
<RaveBrony> There we go
<JRP2234> ADBLOCK Y U AD ME
<HoodyNinja> Yahooz: Nah, just Shizu trollin us
<Herostar_Returned> Hmm. something musta been happening. whether it was the lovable mods getting a laugh or an actual breach is my question..
<J_E_Smith71> I ain't freaking out I just think its funny that they try it again so late
<Errizaria> Kurra: Indeed, hehe
<MahBoi777> what's wrong?
<bluestroms1> so anyway back to the music please
<RaveBrony> J_E_Smith71: Ikr?
<Kurra> hijacking here is like... interrupting a restock to a single Wal*Mart. Once.
<Shizuka> 13they revealed their attack vector and are now useless
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> What n00bs
<HoodyNinja> No more Mips?
<MahBoi777> heheh
<pony_3113> hello
<Buytoast> but the word vector sounds frightful and threatening
<bluestroms1> vector polynomials
<Herostar_Returned> It's still an issue. and I'm looking up programs to either prevent, or severely counterhack the hacker's system. Even if I'm not the direct streamer, if they can steal a stream, I can steal their IP from it.
<HoodyNinja> It is a word that is evil in both depth and meaning
<ponyman> cosplay or a disturbing image? http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x339/AlexeiStukov/Ponyman.jpg
<twilight_sprinkle> vector algebra, may it burn
<bluestroms1> I love vector algebra
<Buytoast> you aint batman son
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> ponyman: Both
<Mesh> Way less disturbing when the colors aren't messed with
<bluestroms1> vector calc is horrible
<bluestroms1> "shurg"...
<twilight_sprinkle> well yeah, i mean vector calc
<Rose`> wait, shizuka plays C&C?
<Buytoast> don't go all gung ho vigilante because some chucklefucks are gettin their jollies riling you up
<twilight_sprinkle> i meant vector math, may it burn
<Tovler> i mean, Mr. Waddles and Fancy Pants were casually in last week's episode. Pear Dr. Hooves and Rarity's were subtly slipped into this week's episode. I'll freak out about Derpy next week.
<Rose`> tell her to marry me.
<RaveBrony> :I
<Shizuka> 13a mournful song for sad people that feel the need to admit they like people that have sexual intercourse with animals, masking it by projecting onto others
<Rose`> Buytoast! you dont understand! theyve rustled that persons jimmies!
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Lol!
<Errizaria> ha!
<RaveBrony> :L
<bluestroms1> Shizuka...wat?

<Moopy> Hey yall
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> hello Moopy
<Moopy> hello
<NocturnalBlade> hi Moopy
<Moopy> hi
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you know, something I'll always like about animu fightan gaems, is that they never have conventional "round 1, fight" type of sayings
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's always something fancy
<Shizuka> 13AHA
<Shizuka> 13I FOUND IT
*Jmo slaps SaxyPretender around a bit with a large trout
<Shizuka> 13mips is weak
<Moopy> Hows mips week shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13but mips is confirmed the weak link in the chain, bronystate is secure as ever
<Moopy> oh
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - so was this a "hack" or just social engineering?
<Kurra> Darkts3|Trader|Snipe: actually... now that I watch that video, I think every day is a good day when I draw. :o c:
<d3rb> noice
<Shizuka> 13no, mips exposes the stream key
<Jmo> Oh zing.
<sub06905> looks like we have to put mips down
<Rose`> stream key~
<sub06905> ill get the gun
<Punkie_Pue> Stream cipher attack?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14?
<Rose`> cipher no ciphing
<Shizuka> 13in addition to the channel name given by the embed iframe, there are two numeric keys needed to broadcast to the channel
<SaxyPretender> 0,14??
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> ¿
*Jmo slaps SaxyPretender around a bit with a large trout
<Moopy> Well i don't like the lime V at all it gets me ticked off a little
<Jmo> Needs less ?
*Kurra wonders why so many evil people are around, and Bob Ross had to go way too early from cancer. ;_;7
<Jmo> <:
<Shizuka> 13one of which is associated with the channel and i'm sure you can easily search for it
<Rose`> but i thought you couldnt stream while there was a connection already in place?
<Shizuka> 13the other is in the open on the iframe itself
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm
<Tovler> At least we still have Fred Rogers and Carl Sagan
<sub06905> or bill nye
*AdamTheDuck licks Jmo
<Tovler> and Elmo
*Jmo slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Bill Nye Your Mom's a Guy
<sub06905> wut
<Punkie_Pue> What was the appeal for using mips as oppsed to another stream service?
<Shizuka> 13mips autostarts when someone starts broadcasting
<Moopy> And this is why that the GNAA needs to be booted offline for the whole year and they need to be banned cause i want them to be gone forever so just saying though
<Shizuka> 13eh tbf this is a pretty glaring hole in mips security
<Shizuka> 13so we just don't use them anymore, problem solved
<Kurra> Awww. I liked Mips, they had a cool name.
<MirrorImage> works for me
<Punkie_Pue> Did gnaa take responsibility? Why did it say it was from /v
<Shizuka> 13basic tactics
<Shizuka> 13aka framing
<ponyman> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me09s0xDeR1r6eu2fo1_250.gif
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Easier to blame it on someone else than to take the blame yourself
<d3rb> like when 4chan used to blame ebaums
<sub06905> trying to ignite a war possibly
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> ponyman: O_O
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Wait a sec so that hijack just now wasn't them, it was you guys just running a security check?
<MirrorImage> sub06905 - yeah, that'll be a trick
<Kurra> Sweetie Belle drinking a milkshake, aaaah I'll never live to see 35
<Shizuka> 13no it was a hijack, a couple twits stumbled into a kline bragging about it
<Shizuka> 13mips is hijacked simply by starting a broadcast to it while another is active
<Shizuka> 13limev is not
<Moopy> Oh shizuka i read some of the stuff on GNAA on google it said GNAA the ipads or something and it said something else to so i read most of the parts of what it said in there
<MirrorImage> so wait, was shizumobile a legitimate login earlier then?
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> GNAA released info on people who preordered the iPad I think
<MirrorImage> i thought i saw SuperBrony64 -b it
<Kurra> I would hesitate even to read google caches of that site
<Shizuka> 13yes
<Shizuka> 13shizumobile is my phone
<MirrorImage> +b*, pardon
<Shizuka> 13that's why it gets autoopped
<MirrorImage> ah, just looked back at the chat log
<MirrorImage> sb64 +b'd someone and your phone /quit'd at the same time
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic4mEc_6JQ8
<Moopy> And while i was looking at the GNAA stuff on google i was fliping off the website with my middle finger and i said screw you GNAA i hate you so bad now so yeah
<thegt90> the hell is GNAA
<Punkie_Pue> its racist.
<Kurra> Moopy you don't have to hate, just vote! *winning smile*
<Punkie_Pue> I can't say here
<Moopy> go look it up on google
<Punkie_Pue> yeah, google is your friend
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Moopy: Best not to let it get to you, then they win.
<d3rb> just dont go to their site thegt90
<Moopy> But...............but
<Kurra> also, don't even go look it up, honestly your mind doesn't need to even see something of so little value
<Moopy> i like mips tv better...........awww sad face:(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so to get people's minds off things, have some music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-_n8jbTDDg
<thegt90> found a link to encyclopedia dramatica clicking it
<kirzstryfe> no reason to hate gnaa, if anything it's pity that I look at them with, because that foul of an attitude will only poison their own life in the end
<MirrorImage> thegt90 - make sure you at least put on a hard hat before you do
<Punkie_Pue> According to wiki, they are an antil blogging trolling orgranization
<thegt90> already got the brain bleach still not enough

<d3rb> who am i?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14don't worry about it, it's over with
<MirrorImage> Who is on first.
*Kurra tries to find something novel and unprecedented to distract peoples from hijacking
<d3rb> no whos on second
<MirrorImage> Kurra - allow me
<MirrorImage> LOOK! a shiny!
<J_E_Smith71> [SWAG]Haku: Yeah but Shizuka discovered it's a problem with Mips that makes it easy to steal the stream, so we're sticking with LimeV from now on
<[SWAG]Haku> The only whos I know are the ones with a PhD
<Moopy> So did i miss anything when i wasn't on here when i was on my xbox elite with my friends?
<Shizuka> 13limev doesn't expose key, i think they're our new best friends

<Shizuka> 13we have now patched that hole on our end by removing mips embeds
<Punkie_Pue> We should send them some lover and tollerance lol
<[SWAG]Haku> hmm

<Shizuka> 13yeah i'll report it to them
<J_E_Smith71> No one say what GNAA stands for its ugly
<HoodyNinja> Oh, this means no more Mips?
<HoodyNinja> Dammit
<d3rb> a poor mans lulzsec HoodyNinja
<Kurra> Cannonball Ice dude >> hackers XDDDDD
<MirrorImage> Punkie_Pue - it's dangerous to make an assumption like that when it comes to security
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> J_E_Smith72: Can I say it in... synonyms!?
<HoodyNinja> Terrorist attack? Secret Service knows, it's fine

<[SWAG]Haku> damn
<[SWAG]Haku> I never win :(
<MirrorImage> i work help desk at my job. i would much rather be told multiple times "X is broken," even if we already knew that.
<ponyman> http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x339/AlexeiStukov/ponyman2.jpg C:
<Kurra> Maybe MIPS will co-credit us and the um, other website!
*Darkts3|Trader|Snipe is listening to Pareidolia
<Kandarihu> I liked how the stream can just come up and even if I'm not watching at first, I know it and am called to attention.
<Shizuka> 13we're going to give veemi a try
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Kandarihu: wut?
<Shizuka> 13not sure if it autostarts or not
<Moopy> So it was freakin /v/ U MAD guy huh?...............i should've known God dang it /v/ U MAD guy why in the hell did you do that to mips huh? why?
<Kurra> Haha, backfire - we'll be together FOREVER, united in recognition for making MIPS more secure :D
*[SWAG]Haku is just a lonely zombie in this hallway
*[SWAG]Haku wishes he could eat some brains
<Shizuka> 13Moopy: it wasn't /v/, gnaa was framing /v/ hoping to incite cross community attacks
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: I'm sure you'll check if there's the same security problem with that?
<MirrorImage> implying that we ever actively go on the attack anymore
<Shizuka> 13already did
<Punkie_Pue> How did gnaa get caught then?
<Shizuka> 13limev and veemi both do not expose the keys
<HoodyNinja> MirrorImage: We don't?
<Kandarihu> LimeV requires each person to click the play button manually.
<[SWAG]Haku> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNtxkmFpWWk
<Shizuka> 13right which is a downside
<HoodyNinja> Kandarihu: Ogod, we just lost half our people
<MirrorImage> HoodyNinja - i haven't seen / heard of one recently

<ponyman> http://i1176.photobucket.com/albums/x339/AlexeiStukov/Hacked.jpg
<MirrorImage> the last "attack" i heard of (and that term gets used loosely) was the call to arms by Tara about Jerry Springer
<[SWAG]Haku> SUDDENLY LINK ATTACK
<Moopy> Oh jeese sorry about that im just disapointed here cause im looking at the photo bucket that guy just send in the chat and im still looking at it now
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> lol
<Kimori> http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=150949098281
<Kimori> Not real sure what I can say about that
<[SWAG]Haku> hmm
<[SWAG]Haku> One Day
<[SWAG]Haku> one day, Ill end it
<Punkie_Pue> has bstate been attacked before by other groups?
<Shizuka> 13someone tried to organize a DDOS at the season finale
<Shizuka> 13it fizzled beautifully
<[SWAG]Haku> One day, one day very soon
<Shizuka> 13they were all excited OMG WE HAVE THEIR IPS FIRE YOUR LOICS
<MirrorImage> Punkie_Pue - DDOS, streamjacks, etc. it comes and goes
<Moopy> *SIGH* oh well i guess im going to miss mips tv for the whole year huh?
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> DDOSes are basically retards with money
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> rofl
<Shizuka> 13except they had cloudflare's IP, who waves off DDOS like a flea
<Afflict> woooow...
<MirrorImage> cloudflare being the hosting company?
<Afflict> someone actually paid 8k for that?
<Shizuka> 13cloudflare is a free DNS service that puts a CDN cache between the domain and your server
<Shizuka> 13cloudflare is the reason our saturday bill doesn't run into the hundreds
<Kimori> yep
<J_E_Smith71> Don't forgot the Hurricane Fluttershy incident too
<Kimori> its extremely rare
<Punkie_Pue> J_E_Smith71: What happened?
<Kimori> Is GBP the currency in Canada too?
<thelonepony> welp back from BL3
<HoodyNinja> I know about the random trolls but do people really hate us that badly?
<thelonepony> bl2*
<MirrorImage> Punkie_Pue - believe that was another DDOS. the stream that day was just general crap
<J_E_Smith71> Punkie_Pue: Site was hacked
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> basically everyone is bored to the point, they just want to cause some chaos >.>
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Hmm, by watching episodes on the Hub, I seem to be missing some interesting attacks by morons
<HoodyNinja> thelonepony: The greatest game evah made
<MirrorImage> Dat1FuglyMuffin - that's why i tend to keep the stream on my computer as well, but muted
<Afflict> no
<MirrorImage> i get to watch the chat reactions, but i'm watching it live and uninterrupted on my tv
<Tovler> k, there was a MLP: the franchise reference but there was a furries reference in the newest Rifftrax.
<HoodyNinja> I just record the shows and sleep till noon :3
<Midnight_Fyre> Can someone tell me which movies won the lottery?
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> MirrorImage You know, I heard someone saying something about that earlier and I'm gonna give it a try next week

<MirrorImage> i dare say that's just creepy
<Midnight_Fyre> thanks
<thelonepony> HoodyNinja: i know, but it will be worth is, learning that dance that claptrap did in that trailer
<sub06905> dat lowercase s

<Mesh> everyone in the GNAA is actually white, straight, and canadian
<thelonepony> it*
<sumica> 00,10they are just a sad excuse for a stream site that is jelly we have more viewers then them
<Tovler> I'll have to buy some Air Force Ones before Friday
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Funny thing is, they probably arent!
<[SWAG]Haku> MirrorImage just bronies trying to love and tolerate the haters
<[SWAG]Haku> I support it
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> sumica: not really, they're just people that have nothing to do in their life but waste oxygen and screw around other people's business
<HoodyNinja> I might be the only person I know who's exited for the elder scrolls mmo...
<[SWAG]Haku> but heres something I dont get
<sumica> 00,10no I was looking at there page and steam group.
<sumica> 00,10it's sad
<Kimori> well, think its time I head to bed
<sumica> 00,10they dont even have good movie picks
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> HoodyNinja: When does that come out, anyways?
<MirrorImage> sumica - NGAA?
<Afflict> night
<HoodyNinja> What steam group? I know of about 12 that don't like bronies
<sumica> 00,10there idea of an even is a few eps of burnnotice
<Kimori> see you laters :)
<Tovler> MPAA?
<HoodyNinja> Dat1FuglyMuffin: 2013 I think
<MirrorImage> or whatever the abbreviation was
<[SWAG]Haku> Haters say they hate bronies because A) we're everywhere B) we dont shut up about what we love C)Wereall a bunch of weirdos. Sounds like the typical description of internet trolls and haters, so why is it that they arent being as hated as us?
<sumica> 00,10no the clowns pretending to be NGAA
<Moopy> Im just going to listen some luna republic music on youtube for a little bit to calm down my anger stuff
<[SWAG]Haku> Ive always windered that
<thelonepony> HoodyNinja: i wish i had a good pc to run it ;3;
<MirrorImage> [SWAG]Haku - probably because they're following the more generic definition of "troll"
<[SWAG]Haku> lame
<MirrorImage> whereas brony allows for a very direct attack
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> [SWAG]Haku: B and C are kinda justified to a point
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> [SWAG]Haku: scratch that B
<[SWAG]Haku> Not really
<MirrorImage> Darkts3|Trader|Snipe - ehhh... yeah, can't agree with you on C, and we've gotten much much better about B recently
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Some of us worse than others
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> MirrorImage: ya thats why i took back C
<Buytoast> mainly B there son
<HoodyNinja> [SWAG]Haku: A) Wondered and B) No one hates them, we just feel sorry for them
<[SWAG]Haku> Most bronies, from what Ive seen, arent the ones who spew out "Ponies ROCK" at every youtube video
<d3rb> ^
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> there are some tho
<MirrorImage> now that's not to say we don't run around with MLP avatars...
<HoodyNinja> You mean ponyfags?
<[SWAG]Haku> Those bronies are the minority in our community
<HoodyNinja> No one likes them :I
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> And they annoy even me sometime
<d3rb> and dont care question ponies to that type of brony either
<[SWAG]Haku> I Say we call these Bronies a new name, since a lot of them, from Ive also seen, are also trolls

<MirrorImage> Zacklego - let's be fair here. how many of us are really here "for the ponies" as much as we are "for the community?"
<Zacklego> I gave them a year and they asked me a week ago if i saw cupcakes.
<Punkie_Pue> Its why people dont like us
<Shizuka> 13let them come on their own
<d3rb> if they dont like it, just be cool about it

<HoodyNinja> I like cupcakes... delicious
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...
<DeathStar> Zacklego: I havn't and I won't
<Darkts3|Trader|Snipe> Zacklego: everytime you try and force conversion, you let the haters win

<MirrorImage> http://www.nickandmore.com/2012/11/21/animaniacs-joins-the-hub-this-december/
<DeathStar> it should be streamed here for those of us who are hubless
<HoodyNinja> I made a vow to try anything once, then I discovered MLP... the rest is history
<SirGanjalf> mornin' everypony
<DeathStar> hint hint
<Shizuka> 13animaniacs is large enough for syndication that i know of
<d3rb> hey SirGanjalf
<thelonepony> Hi SirGanjalf :)
<Shizuka> 13which is what mlp is aiming at with the shorter season
<Spell-of-Gaming> I tried Littlest Pet Shop. Wasn't bad.
<Buytoast> Everytime you make a pony joke, someone vanishes from the mortal coil.
<Zacklego> My friends dispise animaniacs because it is too mainstreem
<[SWAG]Haku> Animainiacs = The MLP FiM of the 90's
<HoodyNinja> Eh, LPS is alright, nothing imma follow though
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - regardless, the Hub is basically becoming a better Boomerang at this point
<d3rb> lolwut
<Zacklego> And yet they dont know about bronies.....
<HoodyNinja> Boomerang has Teen Titans and Ben 10
<Shizuka> 13that's good
<HoodyNinja> No network is better
<MirrorImage> it's just dropkicking us all right in the nostalgia, and all we can do is "Can i have another? I NEED ANOTHER"
<HoodyNinja> Right now, at least
<Shizuka> 13boomerang made me horribly depressed putting dexters lab in the lineup
<MirrorImage> "GIVE ME MORE"
<Shizuka> 131997 IS NOT OLD CARTOONS
<RaveBrony> Boomerang makes me feel super old...
<MirrorImage> in retrospect, Dexter's Lab is rather meh...
<HoodyNinja> Kinda is
<[SWAG]Haku> Boomerang was a good idea, but Ive out grown alot of the shows from my childhood
<Punkie_Pue> i liked dexter
<Buytoast> wait, they have Dexter's Lab on there now?
<[SWAG]Haku> Except some
<d3rb> MirrorImage, lies!
<HoodyNinja> Dexters lab is amazing, but it's mostly the same.
<Buytoast> i thought Boomerang was for shit like Yogi bear
<Buytoast> and el kabong
<Shizuka> 13Buytoast: they did some years ago when we still had satellite
<MirrorImage> Buytoast - i've seen Cow and Chicken on there as well
<Shizuka> 13quick draw mcgraw!
<HoodyNinja> "Dee dee you are stupid" *dee dee proceeds to fuck shit up*
<Darkts3> DRAW BOB ROSS
<MirrorImage> hang on, let me pull up the channel guide and see what kind of stuff they're showing now
<bluestroms1> Shizuka, and to all of the bronystate fans, I've been an everyday viewer to this stream since july 2011 and if there's one thing that I keeps me comeback here is that bronystate is vibrant and dynamic always growing. I've seen people come in, get familiar and become admins themselves I remember when you Shizuka were just a normal viewing same with SuperBrony64 you guys and your devotion to this place to keep it alive and en
<RaveBrony> I used to hate bommerang, becuz it had 'old' shows.... ow i love becuz it has my fav old shows :'(
<Shizuka> 13yeah dexter, cow and chicken, and johnny bravo all launched at the same time in 97
<RaveBrony> O_O
<MirrorImage> oh hey... my tv was on BBC and Dr. Who is on...
<Spell-of-Gaming> I liked Cow and Chicken but it started getting weird
<Mesh> Hey I was born in 1997.
*SuperBrony64 huggles bluestroms1
<Mesh> Ahaha just kidding, 1987.
<d3rb> dat loving textwall
<HoodyNinja> Boomerang turned into my childhood this year
<[SWAG]Haku> My Favorite shows from my childhood: Jhonny bravo, Tom&Jerry, EdEdd&Eddy, and Pokemon
<Mesh> ... I encounter a lot of people online that would've been born in 1997.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02How does this look?
<Mesh> I need to go re-evaluate my life.
<HoodyNinja> Mesh: I was born in that year...
<Shizuka> 13looks like text
<Shizuka> 13oh you mean stream
<d3rb> Mesh, 88 /)
<HoodyNinja> is that a pokemon or a goat face ring?
<MirrorImage> alright, so it's 2am EST right now, and the current Boomerang show lineup is: Dexter's Lab, Secret Saturdays, Samurai Jack, and then it switches back to the old old stuff at 4am
<Zacklego> I just searched for mlp wristwatches and found none.
*[SWAG]Haku was born in '94
<DRHUnleashed> oh god what is thaaaaat?!
<Buytoast> It's all over.
<Darkts3> i think thats suppost to be Haku
<DeathStar> SuperBrony64: that dosn't look like me :(
<RaveBrony> Aw yeah, '94!!
<HoodyNinja> Secret saturdays <3
<Moopy> wow really dude....................really
<Shizuka> 13MirrorImage: samurai jack? that's even worse... that started in, what, 99?
<thelonepony> SuperBrony64: Kirby's origan charecter?
<thelonepony> original*
<MirrorImage> Jonny Quest, Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, Flintstones...
<[SWAG]Haku> SAMURAI JACK IS THE BEST
<MirrorImage> ooo, Captain Planet at 6am
<cachi01> SuperBrony64: can u give us like a little miiverse tour pls lol
<Shizuka> 13if anything boomerang is what cartoon network WAS in the late 90s
<[SWAG]Haku> ^
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Seems like nopony was here this morning.
<Shizuka> 13classic warner brothers alongside awesome new animation
<Zacklego> Can anybody give me a link to a place that sells mlp wristwatches. I already checked amazon and ebay
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: did you draw that blirby?:D
<Shizuka> 13sb is drawing again? you must post to dA remember
<sub06905> SuperBrony64: dat drawing :D
<[SWAG]Haku> Everything about cartoons was great until 2004. Thats when shit started happening on CN, Disney, and Nick.
<thelonepony> SuperBrony64: oh you mean that creepy charecter that "troll" showed us? :D
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: if so, thats an awesome drawing :D
<MirrorImage> [SWAG]Haku - that's about the time they stopped being "Cartoons" and started becoming "Children's Sitcoms"
<[SWAG]Haku> Eeyup
<Mesh> i
<[SWAG]Haku> Live action shows about teens and their problems
<Mesh> actually like some of the sitcoms on Disney.
<[SWAG]Haku> I got enough of that on Nick@Nite
<HoodyNinja> The only good Live action thing disney had was good luck charlie, but even that's gotten old
<Mesh> Just because Waverly Place turned into an exercise of getting things by the censors.
<Mesh> And the censors for that show were basically dead
<MirrorImage> i mean at least Nickelodeon learned and created the NickToon network, which is much more traditional Nick content
<Shizuka> 13i'm going to steal cyan's catchphrase and say i'm cautiously optimistic about season five code lyoko adding live action
<Spell-of-Gaming> The only thing I like to watch on CN now is Adventure Time
<[SWAG]Haku> Anyone remember House of Mouse on disney?
<HoodyNinja> Avatar
<MirrorImage> i.e., Animated Stuff and Power Rangers
<HoodyNinja> Nickalodeon wins
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - wait wait wat?
<MirrorImage> Code Lyoko is still on?
<cachi01> [SWAG]Haku: I DO it was mah fave cartoon
<Shizuka> 13will be in the next year or so that i know of
<HoodyNinja> Code lyoko is over
<PinkiePie40> That show is still on?
<HoodyNinja> WAHT?
<RaveBrony> O_o
<[SWAG]Haku> Code Lyoko is coming out with a ew Season
<PinkiePie40> Holy Globs
<HoodyNinja> That french cg anime is still going?
<Shizuka> 13they've been building up a season five, replacing the real world segments with live action
<Mesh> I watch Young justice.
<[SWAG]Haku> with LIVE ACTION
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Code Lyoko... Live action... We need to stop this?
<HoodyNinja> NOOOOOOOOO
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Hey, Xiaolin Showdown is coming back to
<[SWAG]Haku> Young Justice is kick ass
<Shizuka> 13the clips of lyoko look like they're using the same models, added a new sector design
<SaxyPretender> 0,14too
<MirrorImage> by "new season," are we talking a continuation from Season 4, or a whole new story line?
*HoodyNinja drinks some brain bleach
<Spell-of-Gaming> Live action
<Spell-of-Gaming> WUT
<sub06905> all the shows~
<Mesh> I liked Code Lyoko but I wish it had like all be... normal animation.
<cachi01> SaxyPretender: YAY
<[SWAG]Haku> MirrorImage a few yeasrs after season 4
<Mesh> Because the normal animation parts were rather good looking whereas the CGI stuff did not look at all good.
<Shizuka> 13MirrorImage: from what i've heard, it's a tacked on new season, so we killed xana at the finale of season 4, but season 5 says SURPRISE NOT REALLY
<MirrorImage> Mesh - well think about it
<[SWAG]Haku> Mesh what? The CGI was awesome for a show like that
<Shizuka> 13Mesh: seasons 2-4 did better with the CG
<sumica> 00,10but but live action shizu
<Shizuka> 13especially 4
<sumica> 00,10live action
<MirrorImage> they use CGI for the computer scenes...
<Shizuka> 13live action aelita might make me look it up once it's out
<MirrorImage> YE-AH YE-AH YE-AH
<HoodyNinja> I wanted to see a fight this ep...
<HoodyNinja> I would pay so much money
<twilight_sprinkle> that drawing O_

<Ryunosuke> MirrorImage: you said hey, whats going on? :)
<[SWAG]Haku> nyeh
<sumica> 00,10I wonder if they managed to find kids with foreheads like coffee tables
<HoodyNinja> heyn

<SirGanjalf> I wasn' here yesterday during lottery, what movies were chosen?
<thelonepony> Kirby :3
<Spell-of-Gaming> Heheh
<Mesh> dude Code Lyoko was sort of like reboot in retrospect
<[SWAG]Haku> Hmm?
<Mesh> I did like how dark the series ended up getting !
<Spell-of-Gaming> Coffee Table foreheads
<Shizuka> 13season 3-4 are the best
<MirrorImage> ...and now i want Hub to get Reboot
<HoodyNinja> I never really followed that show
<HoodyNinja> CG turned me away when I was younger :I
<sumica> 00,10reboot is on netflix
<Shizuka> 132 was a little pitiful though it crammed through a lot of backstory for aelita
<[SWAG]Haku> Samurai Jack was never cancelled, its just on hiatus
<Ryunosuke> reboot was ... interesting
<`z> reboob
<MirrorImage> sumica - implying i'm not too cheap to get netflix
<[SWAG]Haku> moo
<RaveBrony> Dat moo
<Shizuka> 131 was all self contained with a couple callbacks and finally an arc on the finale
<Ryunosuke> i wouldnt mind seeing an ... updated reboot, if that makes sense
<cachi01> u liek moo
<Shizuka> 13reboot is also supposed to be getting something new
<MirrorImage> (and don't ask - there really is no reason why i haven't gotten netflix yet other than "Youtube")
<Shizuka> 13feature film in development hell iirc
<Ryunosuke> like more up to date instead of ... 90's-ish
<sumica> 00,10implying I could stream or you know shizu could stream it again
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - that was called "The Matrix"
<superretroworld> still excited over how good cheer on was, somepony calm me down so i can go to bed
<[SWAG]Haku> Hakus going to bed now

<RaveBrony> Wait, this is CoD?
<Meanwhile> I thought the best part of CoD was the receipt.
<StupidSexyCJ> hooray for children
<DeathStar> HoodyNinja: they are the only part of CoD
<XAX> RaveBrony: Black Ops 2
<Spell-of-Gaming> "OH MY GOD YOU BITCH"
<MirrorImage> right, well i'm out for the morning
<MirrorImage> later folks
<Meanwhile> Bye MirrorImage.
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: No, silly, you don't keep the receipt :3
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> I always liked the part of CoD where I paid $60 for the same game I bought last year.
<HoodyNinja> latas mirr-fuuuuu
<HoodyNinja> Your fault :I
<Meanwhile> HoodyNinja: Well it's not like you buy it yourself is it.
<JRP2234> inb4 8 year olds yelling NOOOB
<DeathStar> Meanwhile: if you keept the receipt then no one would have CoD
<HoodyNinja> Yes, I bought a game I like :I
<RaveBrony> Hehe, CoD. The ONLY time ive played it, a kid cried on the mic asking me to stop killing him =_=
<HoodyNinja> What about it?
<Meanwhile> But DeathStar, what about all those 10 year olds?
<RaveBrony> Then again, ive made kids cry on plenty of other games...
<twilight_sprinkle> RaveBrony: dayum, das MLG dawg~
<XAX> RaveBrony: That's not nice.
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> RaveBrony: You are such a hurtful person. It's fun, isnt it?
<Spell-of-Gaming> RaveBrony: That sounds hilarious without the CoD part.
<StupidSexyCJ> children are good at crying, help them to reach their full potential
<XAX> People don't constantly commentate what they're doing on the mic on PC...
<DeathStar> Meanwhile: true true.. but they don't buy the game for themselves do they? if there parents cept the recept...
<twilight_sprinkle> nothin says pro like beatin some kids~
<aniderp> hi
<Jmo> Hayo aniderp
<XAX> In fact, literally almost no one use the Mic feature on CoD on PC.
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: :3
<XAX> that i've seen
<StupidSexyCJ> XAX: that sounds lovely
<Meanwhile> DeathStar: If these parents were attentive enough they wouldn't buy this stuff for their children anyway.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai aniderp
<Spell-of-Gaming> Kids prefer consoles, to be honest.
<RaveBrony> You dont have time to use the mic on PC, everyone is busy using mods and aimbots, lol
<XAX> StupidSexyCJ: We yell at eachother with the chat instead lol
<DeathStar> Meanwhile: fair point.
<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, lol ikr
<RaveBrony> Ive always been a Halo guy, lol
<thelonepony|BL2> SpeccyRush: its facts
<XAX> "we got a rambo in here"
<DRHUnleashed> rambo
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Using a videogame as a babysitter is not a good parenting technique. I see that being used all around me
<thelonepony|BL2> fact*
<HoodyNinja> I remember playing cod 3 on ps2 and not even knowing about multiplayer
<Meanwhile> Dettol protects, fact.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Parents don't give a fuck.
<XAX> I've got CoD1 on my hard drive. somewhere.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Even when bullying.
<AdamTheDuck> XAX, /)
<StupidSexyCJ> Zelda is best babysitter anyway
<Blaze666> hoody cod 2 here
<XAX> AdamTheDuck: eh
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> HoodyNinja: Them days when CoD was for the campaign.
<HoodyNinja> Dat1FuglyMuffin: :I
<HoodyNinja> Campaign was good in BO1
<XAX> HoodyNinja: I enjoyed it.
<XAX> Lol mason has a tulpa.
<cachi01> Skyrim is best babysitter. works for 7 motnhs for jut 60 bucks
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> I didn't /like/ it but it was better than some I'd seen.
<cachi01> months*
<Spell-of-Gaming> 60 bucks for 7 months?
<RaveBrony> I cant understand a word theyre saying
<Spell-of-Gaming> Lolno
<Moopy> you know that sucks though they freakin took out the raidaition symbole emblem on black ops 2
<HoodyNinja> GG cod player: Protects your care package so you can get it
<Meanwhile> 7 months? Try 7 days.
<DeathStar> cachi01: childrens attention spans don't last long enough for Skyrim
<Jmo> radaition symbole
<XAX> holy shit he let go of his mic button for about 3 seconds there
<Jmo> lel
<Meanwhile> If you take your time anyway.
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> MW3 is the greatest example of a bad story.
<HoodyNinja> Never seen anyone else do this
<Moopy> yeah that
<cachi01> Meanwhile: you are talking about main quest? pfft 5 days
<Meanwhile> 7 days if you don't use fast travel.
<Moopy> i mean why did they took it out though?
<Jmo> How about you just actually babysit the kid instead of being a slack arse.
<Mesh> I had way more of an attention span when I was in middle school than I do now.
<HoodyNinja> Jmo: By that logic you call all gamers lonely
<XAX> lol
<Jmo> How is that even relevant?
<HoodyNinja> My parents played games with me
<Blaze666> what kind
<HoodyNinja> My dad would kick my ass in mario party and laugh ;~;
<Meanwhile> My dad owned me at Unreal Tournament.
<Blaze666> oh that kind=(
<RaveBrony> My father let me play Diablo when i was 4 :3
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: then destroy you in COD and call you a noob?
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: "hey nooooob, dinner's ready"
<Dat1FuglyMuffin> Me and my mom played through Jak and Daxter together :3
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: CoD wasn't big on multiplayer when I was 3
<Spell-of-Gaming> Babysitting the kid does not compute to all gamers being single
<DeathStar> me my brother and my sister bonded by killing eachother in spy vs. spy
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: wow 3 huh
<DeathStar> twas fun ^_^
<Jmo> Spy vs. Spy PS2 <3
<HoodyNinja> I never had a lonely childhood, and my life revolved around my ps2

<Ryunosuke> was gonna say, we need a BS icon for our outfit :)
<HoodyNinja> too big?
<thelonepony|BL2> or that i'm an idiot
<thelonepony|BL2> or both :P
<HoodyNinja> I got PS2 but I my tiny laptop can't run that
<AdamTheDuck> Ryunosuke, that's the closest thing we'll get to anything pony-related. http://i.imgur.com/2UN5W.jpg
<swack16> I saw Club Luna
<Ryunosuke> tbh, ps cant support player icons yet, it will create too much server load and make the servers a bit more unstable as they are now :)
<sumica> 00,10he dose better with the pistol
<HoodyNinja> SB might not win this
<Ryunosuke> I know this cause there was (and still is) the discussion about custom paint jobs, logo's etc for EVE and it's implications :p
<Ryunosuke> oh
<Ryunosuke> actually, sumica, the servers in PS2, how ARE they set up?
<sumica> 00,10how is what set up?
<Ryunosuke> the servers
<sumica> 00,10like 10 servers
<sumica> 00,106000 players per
<HoodyNinja> Just dance 4 has gangnam style...
<Ryunosuke> they seem to be stable most of the time, ie. not crashing every other hour
<Ryunosuke> :)
<sumica> 00,10all the servers are us but some are classed as AU or euro
<HoodyNinja> Not sure if good or not
<Ryunosuke> I know that part
<Ryunosuke> umm
<Ryunosuke> how to put this, each server, is on its own server or group of servers right?
<sumica> 00,10not sure of the setup
<Ryunosuke> so you dont have the US servers on one box, the EU servers on a box, etc
<sumica> 00,10they are for all purpouses seprate servers as your trooper is only on one server
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:)
<Ryunosuke> ahh

<AdamTheDuck> :|
*AdamTheDuck throws a bucket of paint at Phase4
<[Alpha]> Clothes? What's clothes?
<Sumica> 00,10so much bitching about inabilty to kill ESF with libs and Gals
<Sumica> 00,10they say the walker is underpowered
<Sumica> 00,10where as I agree it's weak
<Sumica> 00,10but we still kill fighteres just fine in the lib
<Sumica> 00,10mind you more often with the cannon then the tail gun
<AdamTheDuck> I don't really care about the weapons, I just watched half my platoon leave the battle after we started losing territory.
<[Alpha]> Traitors
<AdamTheDuck> It's the people that let NC down really.
<[Alpha]> Even if we are losing. I stick with my team until the very end as I feel it is my duty.
<[Alpha]> 4:30 a.m and I'm still not tired....
<texasboykc09> whos streaming
<AdamTheDuck> Is there anyone streaming?
<alexxm> nope no stream i think
<AdamTheDuck> I don't think anyone is streaming texasboykc09
<texasboykc09> someone was streaming
<[Alpha]> Here we go
<Phase4> k
<Phase4> refresh your streams
<[Alpha]> Yay!!
<Phase4> everything working?
<AdamTheDuck> I'm getting audio
<texasboykc09> so much lag for me
<AdamTheDuck> no screen though
<Phase4> quiet in here
<Phase4> odd
<Kandarihu> It's laggy for me
<Phase4> wow
<Phase4> lots of delay here
<Phase4> bah, why'd mips have to go and have an exploit
<[Alpha]> eeyup
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, try refresh again
<[Alpha]> Wait what do you mean?
<AdamTheDuck> I just pressed ctrl+F5
<AdamTheDuck> No change
<Kandarihu> So how many of the live streaming sites were using mips?
<Phase4> Kandarihu, no idea, don't really care
<Phase4> easy enough to use a different service
<AdamTheDuck> There we go
<AdamTheDuck> I can see now
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, Guns of Icarus? :3
<Kandarihu> I mean, all of the streams were attacked at the same time, right?
<Phase4> oh god the encoder
<Phase4> this is broken
<Phase4> i'll try fix
<Phase4> Kandarihu, no idea
<Phase4> they are trying to attack the site still
<Phase4> not getting far it seems by trying nontheless
<Sumica> 00,10and this is why I like ps2 over ps1 in many cases http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6999/ps2sunderer.png
<Phase4> need to adjust stream but i dont want to interupt music D:

<Phase4> Sumica, did the twitch issue with frames get sorted?
<Sumica> 00,10you are overflowing the sound buffer btw Phase4
<Sumica> 00,10the issues is we are useing esentaly a hack
<Sumica> 00,10the way i pluged in the twich embed is not as intended
<Sumica> 00,10only crome and safari report this
<Sumica> 00,10all otehre borwses it works fine
<Phase4> yeah, i cant stream to limev
<Phase4> something wont let me
<Sumica> 00,10use veemi then
<Phase4> probably the same routing issue that causes problems when watching
<Sumica> 00,10or try out xsplit
<d3rb> Later guys, good luck with the stream issues.
<Phase4> later d3rb

<Sumica> 00,10.......hmmmmmm
<Sumica> 00,10wonder if we can use the autoplay tag like LS embeds have
<Phase4> could be worse i supposed
<Phase4> could be using fmle
<Phase4> how i do not miss that software
<Moopy> Uh oh
<Phase4> urgh
<Phase4> someone decided to stuff their pc
<Phase4> brb, have to fix

<Meanwhile> It was like "Why is Babs being a bitch" then it was "Fried chicken watermelon" and I was like "Oh...Ok."
<Serenity> Meanwhile: That must be the new reason for everything now.
<Serenity> Sumica: I stayed for the whole thing
<WallFlower> Oh and back to what I asked along time ago, the tetsuo iron man movie..... found the soundtrack.
<pony_624> * A Huge horde of ZAWBIES*
<Phase4> that mouse in the scren is anoying
<Phase4> screen;'
<Meanwhile> Clearly Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon need some fried chicken and watermelon.
<Yahooz> Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that I shouldve voted for Ron Paul and what black people enjoy the most in life

<AdamTheDuck> Hello GamerLuna
<CaptainAlliance> So...
<WallFlower> Sup Gamerluna
<CaptainAlliance> How's you get hacked?
<Yahooz> There was a GamerLuna before you
<CaptainAlliance> And was it /v/?
<aniderp> no
<Sumica> 00,10no
<Phase4> 74.91.112.238
<CaptainAlliance> Then who?
<Phase4> CaptainAlliance, doesnt look like
<Phase4> and we didnt get hacked
<Phase4> mips did
<aniderp> hijacked
<Yahooz> CaptainAlliance: GNAA
<WallFlower> No, I think that was just to get us to go over and be like YOU FERGERTS!
<Sumica> 00,10was not a hack either Phase4
<CaptainAlliance> GNAA?
<aniderp> bad name
<Yahooz> ill pm you the initials
<Serenity> It was Hijacked
<CaptainAlliance> ok...
<Meanwhile> GNAA just sounds like an onomatopiea for disgust.
<Jmo> It's so hard to google.
<Serenity> Now the next question is: Why pin it on /v/?
<CaptainAlliance> IDK
<CaptainAlliance> Just checked /v/
<Meanwhile> As in, "GNAA Jaymoo what're you doing to that goat?"
<CaptainAlliance> All they do is bitch about consoles.
<Sumica> 00,10to cause /mlp/ to go to war with/v/
<Jmo> You don't wanna know what I'm doing to that goat.
<CaptainAlliance> But why?
<Meanwhile> You're right, I don't.
<WallFlower> For the lulz
<Serenity> Because ponyfags
<WallFlower> thats why
<CaptainAlliance> Oh, GNAA...
<CaptainAlliance> I thought it meant
<Sumica> 00,10I am not entirely sure it was Gnaa
<Phase4> no proof right now
<WallFlower> Trust me many have commited so many evils for the lulz...
<Serenity> Sumica: I can't say for sure, but I'm lead to beleive they posted something on their site
<Phase4> i meen i've got 1 ip address, could probably match it
<Serenity> Though could be fake, who knows
<CaptainAlliance> Gory Narcolepsies Association of Austrailia..
<Phase4> CaptainAlliance, that is not them
<Yahooz> nah he knows
<CaptainAlliance> But there is one, right?
<Sumica> 00,10well seeing as i set a trap later on to test for the hole
<Phase4> CaptainAlliance, given the internet that wouldnt suprise me
<Yahooz> CaptainAlliance: possibly
<Jmo> Gory Narcolepsies Association of Austrailia, the hell is that shit?
<Meanwhile> Gifted Nublet And Associates.
<Phase4> Sumica, if their attempts on the site are anything to go by we're fine
<Sumica> 00,10either them or some one that read of it from a fail stream site decided to try their hand at it
<Phase4> silly script kiddies who think they're clever
<Gold_Demona> Gasp! No Apple Acres!
<Serenity> Grannies nosh all apples
<Yahooz> plot twist: it was HipsterBrony's evil cousin
<CaptainAlliance> lol
<CaptainAlliance> GrAnyways
<WallFlower> Anyone else here watch, Pleasure island?
<CaptainAlliance> Did you hear tht kyrospawn is dead?
<CaptainAlliance> Is it true?
<Serenity> Does hipsterbrony still piss around here? Or has he gone for good?
<Sumica> 00,10the long and short of it is mips failed not us
<LOL> Hi everybrony
<Yahooz> Ive always hated MIPs
<Serenity> Sumica: So I presume Veemi's the answer for now?
<CaptainAlliance> Is kyrospawn gone???
<AdamTheDuck> Hello LOL
<Yahooz> Lime of the Vs
<Sumica> 00,10yeah we always keep backup plans
<Serenity> I liked mips, probably for the same reason that the mods did
<Yahooz> Kimis livestream :>
<LOL> hi AdamTheDuck
<Yahooz> lel
<CaptainAlliance> Livestream doesn't seem as good as mips
<CaptainAlliance> Or does it?
<Yahooz> LimeV >> MIPs
<AdamTheDuck> LOL why do you persist to have different names GamerLuna?
<Serenity> Mips is VERY stable though usually
<Sumica> 00,10LS is more of a hard ass when it comes to what you stream as well as to how you stream
<Phase4> veemi looks good so fare
<Phase4> far'
<CaptainAlliance> How to stream?
<LOL> hmmmmmmm..........
<Phase4> oh awesome, raven is on
<Yahooz> MIPs, however, is weaksauce
<HWBallerina> You're streaming?
<HWBallerina> Damn.
<Sumica> 00,10veemi is fine but it lacks a few things that mips had
<Jmo> Hey look soveit boy is back
<Serenity> Phase4: Yeah, I remember positive feedback a few months ago from some of you lot
<Jmo> lel
*Jmo slaps Yahooz around a bit with a large trout

<Jmo> relevant*
<Jmo> lel
<Yahooz> CrystalPhoenix: very
<WallFlower> I do not know, just saw the vid on youtube
<Yahooz> but even so
<CaptainAlliance> Daniel Tosh trolled the entire brony community
<CaptainAlliance> I found it hilarious
<Serenity> I like Veemi, works pretty well in Britain
<gunthler> yep
<CrystalPhoenix> CaptainAlliance, like he does in most things
*Jmo huggles aniderp for ze cookie
<CaptainAlliance> Brony stereotypes are hilarious
<CaptainAlliance> Amirite?
<Jmo> cookayy
<CrystalPhoenix> he's just some unfunny moron
<Yahooz> He makes dick jokes
<Yahooz> thats his career
<Jmo> Sounds alot like dabi.
<texasboykc09> and just lost the stream
<CrystalPhoenix> and heck we've got plenty of good coverage to counter those kind
<Yahooz> O U
<Jmo> Kekeke
<CrystalPhoenix> he's just extremely late
<Serenity> Let me end this arguement by saying this: The brony community on a whole is full of criminally retarded people
<pony_624> 6_9
<CaptainAlliance> lol
<Gold_Demona> Stream keeps popping off and on
<CaptainAlliance> It's funny how No one talks about derpy anymore
<CaptainAlliance> Or even mentions her
<Gold_Demona> Why is it funny?
<Serenity> I never did
<Yahooz> You know why?
<CrystalPhoenix> because she's just a background pony
<Yahooz> because the topic is dumb
<CaptainAlliance> ITs funny because of the reactions
<CrystalPhoenix> seriously
<Gold_Demona> It's in the past. Why does it matter?
<Sumica> 00,10just lost stream
<Jmo> ermagerd guyz, srsly.
<texasboykc09> yep
<Yahooz> everything about arguing and over analyzing episodes and characters is so dumb beyond belief
<Kandarihu> Phase4, stream's getting laggy again
*Jmo slaps Yahooz around a bit with a large trout
<AdamTheDuck> Browniestaet, stahp
*Yahooz slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<WallFlower> Personally, I am fine with clop I mean that kind of stuff is all over the place at least they are sentient beings...... Same as being attracted to Asari from mass effect.
*Gold_Demona turns trouts into bananas

<turtlegod98> Jmo get out

<aniderp> broadcast offline
<Gold_Demona> yeah
<Yahooz> See, had we voted for Ron Paul, the GNAA would be merciful on our souls
<Serenity> I like polos
<Yahooz> but then ITS HAPPENING occured
<Serenity> Yahooz: I didn't vote, because I can;t
<Kandarihu> Yahooz, no they wouldn't
<Yahooz> Its a reference to the video
<Yahooz> calm your political nipples
<Jmo> lel
<Meanwhile> I voted for whoever was representing the "I Don't Care" party.

<Serenity> Meanwhile: You can't vote for yourself!
<Jmo> ANSWER THE QUESTION YAHOOZ
<Yahooz> that video
<Meanwhile> Serenity: Says you
<Kandarihu> Oh. That was Ron Paul in the image there?
<Serenity> Yes. Says me. >=D
*Gold_Demona doesn't know about any video call "ITS HAPPENING"
<Yahooz> Meanwhile voted for the queen
<Gold_Demona> I voted for Pinkie Pie
<Jmo> I didn't give a shit.
<Yahooz> You mean Chancelor Puddinghead?
<Serenity> I voted for no-one because I'm not 18.
<Meanwhile> Queens aren't elected.
<aniderp> can i vote for derpy?
<Gold_Demona> No, I mean Pinkie Pie
<Yahooz> Serenity: heh, underage
<WallFlower> I voted for the Ice King
<Kandarihu> Gold_Demona, the second hack attack had a man's face in strange colors with the words "It's Happening" as an image macro.
<Yahooz> its funny because so am i
<Yahooz> and it sucks
<Serenity> I'm almost there though, just 2 years away!
<Jmo> Boo hoo Yahooz.
<aniderp> no the 2nd one was discord
<Yahooz> Jmo

<Gold_Demona> Sotp startin'! D:
<Jmo> You're lucky Yahooz.
<WallFlower> Personally and there is alot of people who will disagree with me.....but I think alot of the things of elections are acting. I think both parties really just work together needing the other to paint as the bad guy.
<Serenity> Don't start with us!
<Kandarihu> You know what? I think it might be worth sending e-mail to mips about the security issue, and they'll have to deal with it asap
<Serenity> Kandarihu: Knowing them, I'd wager that they already have
<AdamTheDuck> Kandarihu, you don't think anyone else already did
<Yahooz> I bet my car that its 3 am
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsAwesome|Napping, go back to bread

*AdamTheDuck tucks AJIsAwesome back to bread :|
<AdamTheDuck> Go. To. Bread. :|
<AJIsAwesome> ;~;
<Kandarihu> Good point. But it's not really a good idea to just make that assumption. What if, in all of this confusion, everypony who DID think about e-mailing them figured they'd already be swamped and sent nothing?
<AdamTheDuck> Or you won't get your muffin AJIsAwesome :|
<AdamTheDuck> Kandarihu, I think I remember Shizu saying she was going to write to MIPS earilier today

<P0N-3> ... I'
<Gold_Demona> I said nothing. <_<
<gunthler> me turtlegod98
<P0N-3> I've noticed kool-aid doesn't seem to attract fruit flies.
<P0N-3> If anything, it seems to repel them.
*Gold_Demona shuts up
<P0N-3> I'm not sure whether I should be impressed or disturbed.
<Phase4> yeah, veemi has had it
<AdamTheDuck> Veemi be ded
<Jmo> You shall know that word shortly Adam .-.

<Yahooz> LimeV will take all of it
<AdamTheDuck> .-.
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: You want disturbing facts about drinks? The milk plant my husband works at also processes artificial fruit drinks. The concentrate comes in on a refrigerated truck and stored in the cooler section of the plant.
<WallFlower> woah woah!........licking you say?
<aniderp> he kissed the rabbit hehe
<KinsagaKing> hey everypony
<Gold_Demona> P0N-3: After it's processed and bottled, it no longer needs refrigerated.

<AJIsAwesome> Kinsagaing: Oh, shush. :P
<Spy> say g ak
<Serenity> I like soup.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: I think a drink whose ingredients require refrigeration but the final drink itself doesn't is more disturbing.
<KinsagaKing> what type of soup, Serenity?
<Serenity> Tomato
<WallFlower> aniderp: That does not surprise me about soup makers.
<aniderp> it wasnt tomato
<Gold_Demona> aniderp: freezing soup really isn't all that weird.
<Yahooz> these wubs
<P0N-3> I'm going to take soymilk, and cook it with tapioca flour so it's a thick gel. I'm going to add green colouring and concentrated apple flavour, and then mix in high proof alcohol before it sets. I'm gonna call it Applegak Daniels. :D
<Phase4> XD
<P0N-3> That was worth the boot.
<WallFlower> It totally was
<Serenity> Yeah, I mostly like tomato soup because it's the colour of the blood of my enemies
<Yahooz> Sumica should really keep it on for the episodes

<RawketLawnchair> Yes, it's true, I love brains.
<Meanwhile> Because I was under the impression sleep was raspberry jam.
<Ordinalthrone> I'm going to bed
<CrystalPhoenix> wait, this ain't dubstep
<Jmo> It could be.
<Ordinalthrone> BUT NOT BECAUSE YOU SAID SO!!
<Jmo> Or it could be milky.

<RawketLawnchair> Dante LOVE pizza
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Ordinalthrone .-.
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Ordinalthrone. :)
<Phase4> i think thats enough tf2 actuallyt
<Cypresswolf> What did I miss last night? my screen screen captured an image of another hijack attempt when it shut off shortly after midnight
<Phase4> Cypresswolf, some anoying people being anoying
<CrystalPhoenix> Cypresswolf, nothing worth mentioning
<Phase4> then we got to watch the episode anyway
<Meanwhile> annoying*
<P0N-3> I loved loved loved the last episode. The music, the plot, it was like something from the late eighties, early nineties.
<gunthler> Phase4: how's HexChat coming along?
<Cypresswolf> same idiots?
<Phase4> gunthler, is working good
<Serenity> Cypresswolf: The stream was Hijacked twice, the first one was 10 seconds after the episode started, and there was a walking orange, the second one was IT'S HAPPENEING
<Phase4> Cypresswolf, gnaa, not sure
<Phase4> well i THINK it was them
<Phase4> hard to tell
<Jmo> I've switched from mIRC to HexChat and back to mIRC
<Jmo> lel
<Phase4> whoever it is they are booring and dull
<P0N-3> Do you guys remember how shows in the eighties used to treat kid characters like complete chracters, and not just stereotypes?
<Yahooz> Im a Colloquy
<gunthler> is it better than WDK Phase4 ?
<CrystalPhoenix> Crystal Empire was Cool, Too many Pinkie Pies was FUN and One bad Apple was OH MY GOSH CUTENESS OVERLORD
<Cypresswolf> I saw the ones during the ep airing
<Serenity> I need to set up an external client
<Phase4> P0N-3, those were the days
<Serenity> LightIRC has it strong points, but also it's weak points
<Phase4> except we still have that now in some shows
<Phase4> like mlp
<P0N-3> Yeah. Well my point is that MLP FIM brings that back with the CMC.
<P0N-3> They're definitely their own characters.
<Phase4> i like the CMC
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Phase4> some people dont, not sure why
<CountDoofus> Haio, everybrony.
<Phase4> ohai CountDoofus
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, CountDoofus. :)
<Serenity> Phase4: Because I hate kids
<Jmo> Allo CountDoofus
<P0N-3> The CMC act... well, like kids.
<P0N-3> It's great.
<Phase4> Serenity, fair enough i suppose
<Gold_Demona> hiyo CountDoofus
<CrystalPhoenix> Rarity and Sweetie Belle are best pony
<Phase4> P0N-3, ikr!
<WallFlower> Who could not love the CMC.....except for people who like scootabuse.
<Gold_Demona> CrystalPhoenix: The two of them are a singular best pony?
<P0N-3> Ikr?
<Yahooz> the CMC promote some fairly sick brony actvity...
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai CountDoofus
<CrystalPhoenix> Gold_Demona, yes
<Yahooz> not gonan lie
<Jmo> Ikr!
<gunthler> Foalcon
<Gold_Demona> :D
<gunthler> >_>
<aniderp> ow my legs..
<gunthler> <_<
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Derpy
<Serenity> KSP
<P0N-3> Yeah um I'm not going to blame the CMC for being perverted by perverts.
<CrystalPhoenix> Rarity's EMERGENCY EDIBLE BOOTS
<Phase4> restarting stream so i can remove the boreders
<Honeybadger> Did you see that flank on the golden Sweetie Belle?
<P0N-3> Honeybadger, you mean the shininess?
<Tervicz> Boots! Not boobs... ;)
<WallFlower> I have met many Pervert's in my time. So much so that I know not a human without at least one.
<P0N-3> Honeybadger, very funny... I don't believe you're John De Lancie...
<gunthler> LimeV broke again
<Phase4> due to derps this is the best i can do
<Phase4> gunthler, i stopped stream, press play
<Phase4> it should be back
<Cypresswolf> Phase is removing the borders, stream will be back up soon
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<P0N-3> So, you're not-... you're not John De Lancie, right?
<AJIsAwesome> P0N-3: I doubt it, my friend.
<WallFlower> Until then let us fill the time with the many things of which we can talk of.
<gunthler> P0N-3: Honeybadger doen't talk much.
<CountDoofus> Sign my copy of Assassin's Creed III, pl0x!
<Yahooz> <3 TheFatRat
<Phase4> i call this craft fusion bomb
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Phase4> watch why
<Phase4> give it a sec to load
<P0N-3> You guys are all probably aware that 'Honey Badger' was security's code word for JDL at Bronycon.
<texasboykc09> phase4 is it big enough
<Yahooz> Its loading
<P0N-3> Because honeybadgers don't care and do whatever they want.
<AdamTheDuck> Yay, time to watch Phase4 bomb Kerbin
<AJIsAwesome> AdamTheDuck: Hooray? :D
*aniderp passes out onto floor
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<RawketLawnchair> Oh no
<AdamTheDuck> wat.
<Yahooz> BOOm
<AdamTheDuck> Boooooooom
<CountDoofus> ded
<Phase4> that looks great with lagsbane enabled XD
<AJIsAwesome> Ka-booooooooom!
<Cypresswolf> I havent caught a Kerbal stream in at least a month :) Yay
<Gold_Demona> This music is perfect for Kerbals. :D
<Phase4> cant remember what the second one did differetn
<gunthler> Gold_Demona: you're a kerbal! :P
*Jmo flails around
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<Jmo> Neeeeergh
<Gold_Demona> gunthler: Don't be silly. There are no female Kerbals. :P
<AJIsAwesome> You alright there, Jmo?
<wipergone2> ded
<Jmo> That's a question within a question while warping within itself.
<gunthler> Gold_Demona: I'm a silly ^-^
*aniderp doesnt move and is collasped on floor
<Gold_Demona> Is it wrapped in an enigma?
<AJIsAwesome> So I'll take as a "no"?
<Phase4> the rockets REALLY want to overheat
<Jmo> It is wrapped in cookie dough .-.
<texasboykc09> let them overheat
<AJIsAwesome> Gold_Demona: The inner machinations of Jmo's mind are an enigma.
*AdamTheDuck noms on Jmo's questions wrapped in cookie .-.
<Phase4> texasboykc09, but then we dont go to space
<CrystalPhoenix> daily reminder that this isn't dubstep
<CrystalPhoenix> please do enjoy the stream
<Yahooz> CrystalPhoenix: did we really need that? XD
<AJIsAwesome> It's pretty obvious that it isn't, CrystalPhoenix. :D
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<CrystalPhoenix> Some people Yahooz some people
<Yahooz> this isnt remotely electronic house
<texasboykc09> phase4, oh yea, forgot about that
<Gold_Demona> My husband actually tried to overheat the engines once. He couldn't do it.
<Yahooz> why would it be dubstep?
<Yahooz> at all?
<aniderp> someone bring me to bread
*Jmo flings aniderp to bread
<Jmo> Huzzah, gentlemently I r
<aniderp> weee
<Jmo> harharhar
*AdamTheDuck throws bread at aniderp
<P0N-3> Hm. I want a bottle of Crown.
<Yahooz> In fact, I bet you cant name the genre of this music
<gunthler> aniderp: no RP o.O
*AJIsAwesome watches as aniderp misses the bed and crashes into the wall D:
<Gold_Demona> He kept making the rocket fly waaaaaay into space to intersect the other planets' orbits. :D
<Jmo> 'No RP' coming from you that is funny.
<Yahooz> ^
<CrystalPhoenix> Yahooz, there's way too many genre in electronic music
<Yahooz> ooof
<Jmo> You checked into Dashiesauce lately?
<Jmo> Owait.
<Yahooz> 2oofs :<
<Phase4> soo unstable
<wipergone2> inb4 there will be explosion
<aniderp> oww i hit the wall :<
<Gold_Demona> My hubby and I have yet to figure out how to steer the rockets to where we want them to go. And I've yet to make the rockets fly high enough to leave orbit. XP
<Gold_Demona> My husband keeps trying to attempt to make the rocket fly past Jool's orbit.
<Yahooz> this is Electronic Dance/ Progressive House
<Gold_Demona> trying to attempt. lol
<Jmo> Your face is progressive.
<Yahooz> summed up simply enough
<Gold_Demona> dat redundancy
<RawketLawnchair> wub wub weeble whop
<Yahooz> Your moms progressive
<Phase4> under control
<Phase4> mostly
<Meanwhile> Your face is electronic.
<Jmo> Lel
<Phase4> this rocket is not designed to be where it is
<Gold_Demona> I wonder if the career mode will explain the pathing process better.
<Gold_Demona> Cuz I know more or less how to do it, but I suck at it
<Jmo> Practice makes perfect Dema.
<Meanwhile> Your face needs practice.
<Jmo> I know right?
<Yahooz> Where the practice women at?
<Gold_Demona> Guise stahp fiting! D:
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Jmo> fiting
<Jmo> I'm having a fit.
<Jmo> Neeergghhhh
<Yahooz> Im so fit >: D
<Phase4> i'd liek to point out that this craft has already exploded
<Phase4> twice
<Phase4> like'
<Jmo> You're fat Yahoez.
<Meanwhile> I...got nothing.
<Yahooz> no u
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Jmo> Katamari gonna roll yo ass.
<WallFlower> Anyone willing to loan me 20,000 dong?
<Jmo> dong?

<Jmo> 2012 right there.
<Phase4> i didnt realise they were the next stage
<Phase4> oops
<Yahooz> That Kerbal is freaking the fuck out
<Meanwhile> Not realising the order your rockets go off is a fairly major oversight.
<WallFlower> Imagine fooling someone into coming to Vietnam saying you will give them 100,000 dollars.......and it turns out it is just 5 U.S dollars.
<Yahooz> Moar TheFatRat :3
<P0N-3> OOOH SNAP SCOOTALOO FLEW AAAAHH!
<Jmo> Less TheFatYahoez
<P0N-3> I didn't notice the first time!
<P0N-3> I'm rewatching it.
<Phase4> now i actually need to close the game and check something
<Meanwhile> Hm.
<Yahooz> yes, less fat of me
<Phase4> Yahooz, he's in a craft called 'fusion bomb 2'
<Phase4> i think thats fair
<P0N-3> Scootaloo FLEW!
<AJIsAwesome> P0N-3: I thought she hovered down to the ground.
<Yahooz> Phase4: fair dos
<P0N-3> Well! That's closer than before!
<P0N-3> She's getting there.
<Jmo> FAIR DOS GOVNA
<WallFlower> She did, hovering and flying are different.......Chickens can hover.
<WallFlower> for a split moment
<P0N-3> Well it's close!
<Jmo> Flying turkeys.
<texasboykc09> bye got to get some sleep
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, texasboykc09. :)
<WallFlower> See ya later neighbor
<Phase4> this is much better
<Phase4> much less lag
<Meanwhile> Well this was a fairly unfortunate development.
<Jmo> Did you finally describe milk correctly?
<Meanwhile> Because of where the monitor is I can't mouse scroll the map in SupCom2.
<WallFlower> I have to go for a bit, just to do a few things in town! See whoever is left in a bit.

<Meanwhile> Shut up please.
<pinkieclone> doctor whooves was with cloudkicker....
<Lil_B> Invi I bet I saw them together! Maybe it was the one that looked just like Derpy
<DoctoDoctorWho> Twilight is smart, thus she has the highest chance of finding out what the hell is going on
<CCCP> A better answer would of been yes or no
<Canebridge> Well, Pinkie is a great friend to Twilight, so maybe they thought Twi would know what's going on with her.. Them.. Wat
<Invi> Lil_B, the coat color the eye color and the hair was close but wrong ^^

<DoctoDoctorWho> When the boss broke in, and he scared them half to death, with a rifle in his hand, and cheap whiskey on his breath.
<Rose`Cephalotus> aww
