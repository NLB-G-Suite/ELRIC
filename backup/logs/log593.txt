<cachi01> war!
<Petrified_Discord> Dat WAR!
<Shooeie> Octavia would be nice with this opener
<twilight_sprinkle> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: are you kidding me
<Vivix> Fallout! Oh God
<JESmith71> Star Wars, nothing but Star Wars, dun dun dun
<otakon> This movie needs more Ron Perlman
<Shizuka> 13Ryunosuke: the problem with turning leveling on is the movie has enough quiet parts to throw it off
<Pinkies4thWall> WAR!
<Ryunosuke> I have played 1, 2, 4 - 12
<RosePetal1> General Grievous is in this!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> twilight_sprinkle: kinda
<JESmith71> This means WAR!
<TrueDerpyHooves> WHY CANT WE WATCH STAR PONIES?!?!?!
<CriticKitten> "There are heroes on both sides." No, there's not.
<Vivix> what about a maximizer and limiter?
<BronyInstrumental> cachi01: you know rikku in FFX?
<RosePetal1> No heroes on each side.
<Tovler> Now for the worst of the Star Wars prequels according to snobs.
<TrueDerpyHooves> la la la laaaaa
<appleclouds> 3 hours later
<RosePetal1> I thought the second movie was the worst.
<Shizuka> 13volume is as high as it goes here without turning on auto leveling
<GabeMoist> Nooooooooo!
<JESmith71> Yeah the lame version of Grievous
<RosePetal1> Attack of the clones.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Send in everyone
<Ryunosuke> FFx/x-2 wasnt a bad game, just was a bad FF game imo
<Ryunosuke> that sun flare
<Dark92Enigma> Ryunosuke: technically the 6th one was the last but this <---- was the final prequel
<JESmith71> He was so much cooler in the 2D Clone Wars
<CriticKitten> Tovler: Honestly this is the best of the three, which is....somewhat hilarious and also sad.
<twilight_sprinkle> this movie is as good as the originals imo
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Inbound awesome chase music, followed by 2 hours of boringness
*Nittany_Discord 11,01levels Shizuka
<RosePetal1> If you watch the cartoon Grievous was badass.
*Shizuka 13has to resist just quoting the whole riff...
<Dark92Enigma> PREVIOUSLY ON STAR WARS: CLONE WARS
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<RosePetal1> Nothing happened.
<Shizuka> 13not to mention i'm ahead of you guys anyway so it wouldn't line up

<Spectrum_Rush> SaxyPretender: Jedi Interceptors
<Bronysith> which side is which?
<TrueDerpyHooves> damn pop up adds
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: yes
<CriticKitten> This fight doesn't seem terribly organized.
<RosePetal1> People like the original.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah there we go, forgot the name >.<
<Shizuka> 13fun fact, saturn uses this to test video decoding quality
<Tovler> I liked the 3D cartoon version of Grievous the best. 2D seemed OP and overly stylish.
<CriticKitten> Everyone's just mixed together.
<RosePetal1> It's just flying.
<TrueDerpyHooves> EXPLOSIONS
<RosePetal1> with style.
<TrueDerpyHooves> BBOOM CRASH
<RosePetal1> R2!
<Dark92Enigma> GO R2!
<XylemTube> these ships remind me of the hurricanes from Eve Online
<Vivix> I have terrible video encoder- even makes stills blurry
<TrueDerpyHooves> R2 IS BOSSLY
<RosePetal1> Hello Different actor for Anakin.
<Lil_B> I always like to remind myself that thi technology is inferior to ep 4-6 XD
<twilight_sprinkle> continuity: anakin Still cant act
<SaxyPretender> 0,14still Hayden Christensen iirc
<Vivix> but I can't afford adobe premier, and I don't know shit abou video so don't know the alternative
<Bronysith> This is easily the best one of the prequels. But it is just a dog turd without the scent, not as bad but still shit
<RosePetal1> Oh.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you can tell by the broody eyes
<Shizuka> 13SaxyPretender: unfortunately
<CriticKitten> Dem early X-Wings
<Meanwhile> And the rock solid face.
<Shooeie> CGI clones
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Where are the Kerbals?
<RosePetal1> At least it's better than the Second Movie mind you.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> We're in space
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fun fact: I have 2 toys for those Clone Pilots
<Obsidian> "X-foils"

<RosePetal1> How can missiles fly in space?
<Shizuka> 13PFFFFFF
<CriticKitten> Heat seekers!
<Spriggals> lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> God damn it Starfox could do a better job than you!
<Fou_Lou> Is the Video quality bad because of the stream or the source?
<Spriggals> PEW PEW
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: why did anakin want to help out an expendable unit? its too late to make up for the last movie...
<Shizuka> 13oh yes
<Shizuka> 13and pew pew
<twilight_sprinkle> RosePetal1: same way rockets fly?
<Tovler> they flyin' fancy
<DocSane> This is the prequel I have the least problems with, but mainly because it actually feels like it's directly conencted to original Star Wars.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This makes me think of Sector Y for some reason
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: because hes a goody guy"
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Starfox?
<appleclouds> boooom
<Pinkies4thWall> Shizuka: but of ccourse Pew pew
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I actually like the battles in the prequel trilogy
<Shizuka> 13they're right over the planet, so for once in the entire history of space movies it makes sense for there to be explosions
<Lil_B> SpadeMagnes[R] or sector X with all the ships
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: but they are an expendable unit. No personality or anything
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronysith: PC repaired!
<Shizuka> 13audible explosions i mean
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Battle of Geonosis <3
<RosePetal1> I have very little problems with this one. Atttack of the Clones is the one I hate.
<Tovler> This movie seems so much more quiet without Rifftrax
<Vivix> I dislike most battlescenes, just not interesting
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: ...
<Spriggals> These things remind me of those things in halo
<Shizuka> 13woo woo woooooooooo~
<Vivix> but--yeah
<appleclouds> noooo r-4
<RosePetal1> Now there's bugs.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> so much for that

<Pinkies4thWall> Nittany_Discord: ded. movie over
<RosePetal1> Do a Barrel Roll!
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: thats like trying to save a particular piece of grass in a giant field
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: grass isnt sentient
<RosePetal1> Too bad.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Where is Starfox when you need them?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: everything is burning but he wants to save ONE piece of grass
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: it doesnt feel pain or fear
<Vivix> simile
<Thrackerzod> ooooo car is best car Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13and then anakin got obi wan killed, and the resulting paradox resulted in the entire star wars series ceasing to exist
<Tovler> The buzz droids are making Mrs. Doubtfire noises.
<Meanwhile> Probably for the best really.
<RosePetal1> Oh Anakin, always not listening I see.
<Vivix> oh Doubtfire!
<Vivix> Man that movie was fun
<PinkiePieYoshi64> R2 FTW!
<Shizuka> 13experts are still determining whether the loss of hayden christiansen's acting was worth losing the films
<RosePetal1> Go get him R2!

<Spriggals> I hate how the droids voices in this one changed
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Because reasons
<BronyInstrumental> how come obi gets a cool entrance and anakin just gets out normally?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14They dropped droids like sabers drop basses
<Meanwhile> Why do the droids need to talk?
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: its a joke
<Fou_Lou> Shizuka: easter eg by the programmers

<RosePetal1> How will this movie get entertaing.
<XylemTube> dangerous.... with no hands....
<XylemTube> wat
<Bronysith> And then anakin and obi wan and yoda and that guy over there
<Spectrum_Rush> heh on armed.. no hands...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Meanwhile a battle is still going on
<Shizuka> 13oh hey
<Shizuka> 13i never noticed that
<cachi01> about YOUR MOTHER
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[R]: Really.
<Shooeie> A hand for a hand
<DocSane> Yes, and that was also wrong.
<twilight_sprinkle> dem sand people in the back
<Shizuka> 13the reaction shot of anakin after he mentions the sand people, you hear an echo of them
<DocSane> Chancellor, are you the devil?
<RosePetal1> Not the Jedi way. But Obi Wan had to kill Darth Maul.
<Bronysith> WHY U DESPERATE TO ABANDON OBI WAN?!
<RosePetal1> I noticed that too.
<Gaston> lol
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka How come i never knew that?
<Bronysith> RosePetal1: stupid goerge lucas is stupid
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> God i hate palpatine -_-
<DocSane> Shells?
<XylemTube> DEFINITELY NOT SUSPICIOUS
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So how much of Grevious is organic anyway?
<Vivix> oh god terrible VA
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> WILHELM
<Fou_Lou> yay
<SpadeMagnes[R]> THAT SCREAM
<cachi01> wilhelm scream
<Shizuka> 13PREPAH TO BROADSIDE!

<RosePetal1> I heard Wilhelm Scream.
<Kandarihu> RosePetal1, Darth Maul wasn't defenseless.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh hai robot that's been **cked up
<Shooeie> AHH
<Obsidian> Whilhiem!
<Gaston> wilhelm FTW
<Lil_B> the cancellor kinda looks like the older version of Q (and I don't mean like John Delance now)
<RosePetal1> Oh.
<Bronysith> Shizuka: you never noticed that? i heard it the first time i saw this shit in *megusta face* 6th grade
<Kandarihu> I also heard Wilhelm
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: its not stupid...
<Meanwhile> Shizu: Pirates ref?
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka that of Christopher Lee playing Heavy Metal (F*** YEAH!)
<Shizuka> 13want it to be next week
<Spectrum_Rush> Und dann Shizuka was Elizabeth Swann
<Gaston> aaaAAAAh.
<RosePetal1> Oh no!
<CriticKitten> Uh.
<Shizuka> 13so i can show pirates :3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The Egg Carrier is Loosing altitude!
<Dark_Horst> see and this makes no sense. spaceships, but the board-weapons look like teched up pirate cannons
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: it is inconsistent
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lil_B, I do admit there is some similarity
<Shooeie> GRAVITY BITCH
<BronyInstrumental> Bronysith: lucky you. i never have
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the best thing to come out of the prequel series was the Clone Wars game
<cratorkid> arent they in space?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> *Insert Metroid Escape sequence here*
<RosePetal1> But wait Pirates was not a trilogy.
<Gaston> ^
<Vivix> What pirates are on next week?
<DocSane> Um, would artificial gravity really work that way>?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> I woke up to find that someone put my ac to 90 degrees =.=
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: would you agree that the prequels are somewhat inconsistent?
<RosePetal1> And Star Wars BattleFront.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hi everypony.
<cachi01> hi ZappyTheUnicorn!!!
<Thrackerzod> SaxyPretender and Battlefront
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and Star Wars Battlefront
<Sabershy> SpadeMagnes[R]: I think it was brain, heart, lungs, trachial throat, and half of his stomach.
<Obsidian> Hi ZappyTheUnicorn
<BronyInstrumental> hi ZappyTheUnicorn
<Tovler> Is the Oceans Trilogy next week.
<RosePetal1> Whee!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14how did I forget that ;__;
<Lil_B> DocSane I think at this point its the gravity of the planet
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: all jedi get the urge to get revenge, theyre human. whats important is that they dont dwell on it
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: ep 1 darth maul had high ground and obi wan killed him. Episode 3 "i have the high ground" he chops anakin
<Gaston> weeeeeeeee
<Kandarihu> Vivix, it couldn't be One Piece. Too many movies.
<GabeMoist> Battlefront is amazing
<Thrackerzod> Saxy Ginx
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat hug
<Shizuka> 13i'll check our lists, i'll show oceans if we have an opening
<Vivix> Yeah- pirates of the carribean?
<RosePetal1> Were gonna die!
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: yeah, the high ground thing was stupid. but other than that 3rd episode is excellent
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Shizuka, FUND IT
<DocSane> Lil_B: Except they're still in free fall, and... Oh, never mind.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> This escape needs more metroid music
<XylemTube> dem bathooks
<Spectrum_Rush> SaxyPretender: you must be tired, you were raveing about battlefornt just last week
<RosePetal1> Lack of music!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I was?
<Shooeie> Shizuka you got Back to the Future?
<XylemTube> hat-hooks even
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: again. it is just a dried turd without the scent. not as bad as a wet steaming pile.
<Gaston> I like the background music
<Shizuka> 13we showed that already
<cachi01> Bronysith: in the episode 3 videogame theres an alternate ending where anakin kills obi wan the same way obi wan killed darth maul
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<Kandarihu> Shooeie, we already did BttF
<RosePetal1> Lol shields.
<Bronysith> cachi01: i know. i played it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So what was Grevious before he became a cyborg anyway?
<Vivix> Why does he have a russian accent?
<Gaston> the cone of silence
<DocSane> General, if you're a droid, why are you coughing?
<otakon> Goddamn that line
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Obi Wan is talking about the writers
<Shooeie> Dig under....
<Tovler> :( The Matrix, Pirates, Lotr… I hope we have room for the Oceans Trilogy
<XylemTube> nope
<Shizuka> 13r2d2 is perpetually high...
<RosePetal1> Anakin is being Patient!?
<Gaston> THE MATRIX
<Gaston> YES
<otakon> "How did this happen, we're smarter than this!"
<Dark92Enigma> WHY DO THE SHILEDS DO SOMETHING, AND THE RAILINGS DON'T?
<RosePetal1> Droidekas!
<otakon> goddammit
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat kick
<Shizuka> 13we did matrix too
<Shizuka> 13first week
<cachi01> Bronysith: fighting against your friends is fun :D
<RosePetal1> How dare you kick R2.
<Gaston> dammit
<otakon> Goddammit this movie
<Dark92Enigma> SHIELDS*
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: ooh also. ep 2 obi wan jumped out the window when it wouldve made sense for anakin to do so. then obi wan said "Patience use the force. Think your way through"
<PinkiePieYoshi64> R2 is.... incredibly owned...
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: also, obiwan was avenging someone else, whereas anakin was angry at dooku for losing his arm. metaphore or not, youre wrong
<otakon> ARGH!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14not sure if Lampshade...
<Meanwhile> Wait, Shizuka. We did?
<Tovler> If you kick a Droideka, it rolls
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Icecream makes everything better :)
<Gaston> Lord of the rings?
<cratorkid> ^
<cachi01> ^^
<Gaston> ^^^
<DocSane> Dear God...
<RosePetal1> Anakin Skywalker.
<TrixieMuffin> did we do Jaws yet ?
<Vivix> Lotr was good, and Mike Morasky worked on it
<RosePetal1> lol.
<otakon> suddenly the droids have attitudes?
<Vivix> so it's win win
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: obi wan impulsed and then said use patience lol
<cachi01> DocSane: dat combo breaker
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why does he keep collecting the lightsabers?
<cratorkid> haha
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> otakon: he's not a droid
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: trophies of battle
<Shizuka> 13SpadeMagnes[R]: next week on Hoarders
<SaxyPretender> 0,14"shorter than expected"
<CrimsonPhoenix> Apparently George was jealous of the guy that created grievous
<RosePetal1> He's part droid.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14CALLBACK
<Shooeie> Nice come back
<Obsidian> SpadeMagnes[R]: Its his thing
*Bronysith grabs otakon s beard
<Spectrum_Rush> SaxyPretender: call forward
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka we're still due for an Indiana Jones trilogy
<Tovler> we're running out of Trilogies with more than 1 good movie in them.
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: no the goddamn droid that said "You're welcome"
<RosePetal1> So, he's a Jedi bounty hunter.
<Vivix> Lucas still works on the films?
<Shizuka> 13next week
<Kandarihu> Oh, the Matrix sequels were the only movies of the trilogy I skipped out on.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat diversion....
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...touche
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: im tired of expaining obvious things just because you want to hate the prequels so much
<Pinkies4thWall> R2 is on crack
<otakon> Bronysith: ouch, what are you doing?
<RosePetal1> I want that sword.
<Dark92Enigma> oh YEAH
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Well, I can't stay for long. See ya'll later.
*Bronysith licks otakon s beard
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is it really wise to be fighting in the control room?
<otakon> O_o
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: he jumped because had he waited a second more the droid wouldve flown away
<RosePetal1> No.
<DocSane> How do I take any of this seriosuly iof the droids are ALL played for comedy?
<RosePetal1> Where's the music.
<otakon> yeah it can fight with no head
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Suddenly my grandmother's internet has gone to hell.
<Fou_Lou> RosePetal1: nope. he justs kills jedi and collects their swords.but for his own reasons
<Meanwhile> I can't believe we had the Matrix trilogy already...how did I miss it?
<RosePetal1> That's amazing.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: but it was out of character. considering that anakin is the impulsive one
<Vivix> movies are better the less muisc they use
<otakon> RosePetal1: the klaxon is the mucis
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: when he told anakin to wait the villain was trapped in the bar place, there was no escape for him
<RosePetal1> Coward.
<appleclouds> the headless hores
<Pinkies4thWall> DocSane: trick question. you eat the droids for dessert
<XylemTube> Boss fight
<Tovler> We stopped considering droids a threat movies ago.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i like skyrim i am not going to like the prequels...
<ponyfromPR> hello ther
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: it wasnt out of character, being wise doesnt mean being slow
<RosePetal1> Nope.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> YOU LOSE GOODD AY SIR
<Shizuka> 13GENERAL! WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THROWING LIGHTSABERS IN THE HOUSE!
<otakon> smart actually
<Gaston> the godfather is a trilogy
<SpadeMagnes[R]> YOU GET NOTHING
<Vivix> oh god I love legs like that
<Dark92Enigma> GAME OVER, MAN, GAME OVER
<appleclouds> *horse
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Wouldn't they suffocate as well...
<RosePetal1> Aliens a trilogy.
<Gaston> sort of
<otakon> Actually WHY does a droid run ship have oxygen in it?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Needs more metroid escape music!
<RosePetal1> Physics don't matter.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I really like his cape
<Lil_B> their bodys should decompress now :/
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: yeah and how hard was it to get you to even try to play skyrim
<Dark92Enigma> RosePetal1: it was shown already
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, not just droids in there, otakon
<Tovler> Can Step Up still be considered a trilogy?
<tigher1001> hi
<otakon> PinkiePieYoshi64: Greivous has a independant supply
<RosePetal1> Batman Nolan series is a triology.
<Gaston> I really like her.... mane?
<Bronysith> otakon: it is george lucas logic...
<BronyInstrumental> Lil_B: questioning stuff? do it right! Bodies*
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Grevious still has lungs
<Dark92Enigma> ABANDON SHIP!..........CRITICS AND CRITICS FIRST!!!!!
<Gaston> and other organs
<Ryunosuke> he's gonna crash it
<Vivix> Talking about physics in a Sci Fi movie is boring
<RosePetal1> Indiana Jones was a trilogy. Well kinda.
<CriticKitten> UH OH
<SpadeMagnes[R]> THE EGG CARRIER NUUUU
<Pinkies4thWall> dat UH OH
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat uh oh....
<Dark92Enigma> RosePetal1: It will be shown NEX WEEK
<Gaston> Indiana jones
<cachi01> ud oh
<Dark92Enigma> NEXT*
<Dark_Horst> welp, there goes the reverse thrust
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: like i said, that wasnt out of character. whats more our ot character, however, is that obiwan said they shouldnt do any more than protect padme, now That was inconsistent
<Vivix> Ooo I've never seen indiana jones, you guys gonna show it?
<RosePetal1> Half a ship is better than no ship.
<Midnight_Fyre> Excellent! I finally have internet connection. Looks like I missed the first movie though
<Tovler> Is Speed a Trilogy?
<CriticKitten> Now THIS is podracin!
<Gaston> the only good one was the first one though
<CriticKitten> *g!
<Lil_B> BronyInstrumental I question everything! and no bad gremer will stop me
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Robotnik is gonna be pissed....
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Grrr as I was sleeping I overheard my mother say that they were going to my father's house to eat. I wae up and bam no one except me
<RosePetal1> It's a meteor!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wut ?
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> -wake
<Gaston> dod we do Lord of the Rings yet?
<Gaston> *did
<Dark92Enigma> SpadeMagnes[R]: No PROMOTION for them
<RosePetal1> I think we did.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: and yet despite saying that he jumped after the droid. that was inconsistent, but its not a reason to condemn the episode
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat police escort :O
<Tovler> Easy R2, you almost made me act!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Send in everyone!
<RosePetal1> Lol hoses.
<Jim> from their facebook: "We will be conducting a stress test on Thursday, August 2 from 12:00 Noon PACIFIC Time to 4:00 PM PACIFIC Time."
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> too hot
<RosePetal1> It's too hot!
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: plus i was talking about ep 3, ep 3 is excellent
<Tovler> MAVERIIIICK!
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: "Oh anakin i cant love you. i just cant" she says whilst wearing a very sexy outfit
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WOAAAAH
<The_Si> Hot like sand.
<Pinkies4thWall> this is why anakin is best starpilot
<Shooeie> Land gears
<TrixieMuffin> Did we do Twilight yet .... (ducks and runs)
<Gaston> Half life is not a trilogy
*Bronysith licks TrixieMuffin
<Vivix> I saw all Twilight movies
<RosePetal1> No.
<Vivix> noot bad
<appleclouds> like a boss!!!
<Vivix> Avatar was worse
*Dark92Enigma NOTHING LIKE A GOOD LANDING..........
<cachi01> TrixieMuffin: YOU CANT RUN AWAY FROM ME!!! *GETS AN AXE*
<Gaston> we all know why...
<Spriggals> What about the people in that tower?!
<RosePetal1> Twilight is not a trilogy.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehh still have to re download everything ...
<Midnight_Fyre> Vivix: I'm very sorry
<Kandarihu> Any landing you can walk away from.
<Gaston> Twilight Sparkle is
<DocSane> Did we do all the G3 pony videos yet?
<ponyfromPR> lol
<Vivix> It wasn't worse than anyo ther teen movie
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: hormones maybe, but again, those are minor details
<Obsidian> TrixieMuffin: That's noa trilogy, that's a pony.:)
<Vivix> Avatar seriously pissed me off more
*Bronysith murders DocSane
<Spriggals> The falcon can be spoted int that secen btw
<RosePetal1> No, let's hope not.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Testing.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> And yet... what happened to the battle above Coruscant... it LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL DAY!!!
<cratorkid> why do vampires in twilight sparkle?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chat is not moving for me.
<Tovler> Wasn't Harry Potter 8 rejected because it was gonna get played in the future?
<StinkomanFan> In the Lego Game Obi-wan and Anakin never got kidnapped in the first place
<Gaston> its working...
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: youre not honestly saying ep2 sucked because padme wore a saucy dress?
<Midnight_Fyre> So do these Star Wars prequels count as animated films?
<TrixieMuffin> oh wait , is Underworld a trilogy ?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: it just seemed like one of the most forced romances ever. idk, they arent the worst movies i have ever seen
<Pinkies4thWall> SaxyPretender: that was horrible by my standards. that landing?
<cachi01> cratorkid: the sick and weird mind of stephanie meyer
<Shooeie> Did we do Sipderman yet?
<Fou_Lou> PinkiePieYoshi64: battle probably happend of the other side
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah >.<
<Dark92Enigma> OH SURE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I love how he just blows off him killing Doku
<Vivix> Bronysith: yeah, it's not great. but the hate is just because hate is fun
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Fou_Lou: Hmm... seems plausable...
<Gaston> nine times.
<RosePetal1> Crap, I see Jar Jar.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: no. i mean it was a sexy natalie portman. i know i would like to dock in her port....man
<RosePetal1> Mace Windu.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :P
<Petrified_Discord> Moar shit we don't get to see. Yaaaaaaay.
<Gaston> im still trying to think of trilogies
<Dark92Enigma> RosePetal1: Let's hope he doesn't TALK
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: yeah, ep 1 and 2 isnt too good. but its not bad either, and its enjoyable. and as for ep 3, imop its as good as originals
<Shooeie> We do the Spiderman Trilogy yet?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hey it's Samuel L. Jackson IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<RosePetal1> He doesn't
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> damnit Jar Jar, why are you still alive???!!!
<ponyfromPR> lotr
<Gaston> The Dark Knight Trilogy
<Tovler> The fat guy is Lucas himself, I think.
<Ryunosuke> that gold armor
<Stormfox> that blue guy from the last movie really let himself go XD
<Gaston> I already said lotr
<Gaston> twice
<Vivix> So Much Bluescreen
<XylemTube> i know jedi are space monks and all, but they should start considering blasters
<RosePetal1> Lol that reminds me of that Robot Chicken skecth from earlier this afternoon.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i think that episode 1 couldve been tossed. ep 2 is awful. i think the only prequel that should exist is 3. then shit makes sense
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: i tend to agree. For my taste in Ep 1 and 2 it seemed like nothing really was happening
<appleclouds> mua
<Ryunosuke> those hair buns
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> ...:S
<Ryunosuke> I seen those somewhere
<Ryunosuke> oh... wait
<otakon> Leia buns
<Tovler> I should put on headphones so I can hear the movie… nah
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: what i love about the prequels is that for once love isnt the ultimate goodness,they show how love can be just as evil as hate. they also show the dangers of emotion at all, which is quite innovative relative to most other movies
<otakon> RIP OFF!
<Petrified_Discord> Dem buns
<Shizuka> 13(this is one of those quieter bits of the movie i was talking about that throws off autoleveling)
<RosePetal1> Well, at least we know where Leia got that hairstyle from.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i also dont get the hatred for hayden christensen. he did fine with the lines given to him
<Shooeie> Dat whisper
<Shizuka> 13it's so much quieter than action scenes it overcompensates
<Spriggals> Mmm cinnabon- Wait
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: also the prequels have much more character development than ot
<Gaston> They could have compacted the first three episodes into one movie.
*Spectrum_Rush not sure if better love story than twilight :|
<Vivix> They should have mastered the movie soundtrack better
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, then Anikin's mother would be a noodle incident.
<Ryunosuke> Mom? MOM?!?!
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: too bad it's brought to us via souless sword fights and bad acting.
<TrueDerpyHooves> DAMMMMMIIIITTTT ADD
<Dark92Enigma> RIP OFF <-------------- Like Mother, like Daughter
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: he couldve been better
<RustyMeat> PREGGERZ
<otakon> she's PREGGERS
<Gaston> oh sheet
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: but he isnt god awful.
<Dark92Enigma> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN
<otakon> DUN DUN DUN!
<TrueDerpyHooves> WOOOOP
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> :S
<Spriggals> His face...
<PinkiePieYoshi64> YOURR WHAAA?!?! *Slashes her witha lightsaber*
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: he is a whiny character. CAUSE IT WAS IN THE SCRIPT
<Pinkies4thWall> OMG BABBIES
<Obsidian> Looks like she has buns in the oven... as well as her hair.
<otakon> goddamn herdmind
<VenHur96> DUN DUN DUUUN!
<Vivix> Too much heterosexuality
<Reikim> So...completely random question for anyone who's still on here. If Pinkie's sister, Inky, were to have a daughter, what would said daughter's name be?
<TrueDerpyHooves> dat face
<Shizuka> 13so.. nine months pass between here and the end of the movie?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Awkward....
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: hes pretty bad id say, his acting just doesnt fit right
<Shizuka> 13or..
<appleclouds> :O
<RosePetal1> I is pregant.
<StinkomanFan> HOW IS BABBY FORMED?
<RosePetal1> I guess.
<Midnight_Fyre> I bet nobody could have predicted that would happen
<otakon> Shizuka: I would guess 9 months
<TrueDerpyHooves> 6_9
<Reikim> Shizuka: MAGIC JEDI FORCE PREGNANCY
<Shooeie> :O Shocker
<Gaston> stuff is sbout to go down
<RosePetal1> Let us embrace.
<Fou_Lou> Shizuka: 6 to nine probably
<Jim> I have no idea
<TrueDerpyHooves> hello!
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: i dont hate him, but his acting is just weird at times
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: it is the writing, he did fine with the shit lines given to him
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: premature birth more likely
<Shizuka> 13and yeah that music spike, can't do leveling tonight :/
<Ryunosuke> she also ate spaghetti\
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Utapau :D
<Vivix> Haha
<RosePetal1> Blame the script writer.
<Reikim> Shoot. I suck at making up names.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I still find the explination for the Force in the prequels bullshit
<RosePetal1> The planet that is one huge pit!
<Vivix> Writers have to take their part of the blame when actors fuck up
<Gaston> be back getting popcorn
<Meanwhile> What's the character?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: like i said, it doesnt fit imo at times
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: one thing that really bugs me though is the midochlorians
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> did someone just said something about spaghettie? now im hungry lol -_-
<Kandarihu> Padme is pregnant. Enter, Luke.
<CriticKitten> Shizu: According to my novels....3 years between Ep 2 and 3.
<StinkomanFan> In the lego games the Effects were much better
<cachi01> UTApau
<Fou_Lou> SpadeMagnes[R]: i like it more than "uhhh its a mystical power around us"
<RosePetal1> It's not just the directors fault, It can be the script writers fault anyone.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: another thing i dont agree with, imo medichlorians are a very good idea
<TrueDerpyHooves> haha chicken legs
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: in the OT it was a spiritual thing...in the prequels they are biological...
<Midnight_Fyre> Bronysith: True. It's really hard to take this dialog seriously regardless of how well it's spoken
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat cough
<RosePetal1> Hello emperor.
<otakon> hiya Emp
<Reikim> Daughter of Pinkie's sister Inky, thus making her Pinkie's niece. She's not all that important in the grand scheme of things, just needs a name.
<TrueDerpyHooves> dat bow
<otakon> dat Darth Sidious
<CriticKitten> So yeah, well over 9 months. This is near the end of the Clone Wars, and Ep 2 was the start of that war.
<VenHur96> It's weird that the third movie got the most praise just because of Dar-...well, you'll find out.
<Tovler> Grievous's coughing has evolved into wheezing.
<Dark92Enigma> BUT WE LOST COUNT DRACULA!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE
<Vivix> Did luke write this?
<Meanwhile> Blot.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> father ?
<Pinkies4thWall> Dat emperor
<otakon> I mean seriously, they couldn't FRIGGIN FIND HIM BEFORE THIS?
<Vivix> WAIT!
<Dark92Enigma> BUT WE LOST SARUMAN!
<TrueDerpyHooves> dat robe
<Vivix> Lucas..Luke Skywalker
<Reikim> Never mentioned because otherwise the story would get clogged.
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: saying ''magic'' wouldve been a cheap way out. the force is still spiritual, but since they exist in our universe, there has to be an explanation to how they manipulate it
<otakon> Yeah the Sith don't work like that
<RosePetal1> Lol.
<Obsidian> He likes them young
<XylemTube> not exactly subtle
<Dark92Enigma> LUCAS................DARLING
<PinkiePieYoshi64> His name... shall be DARTH BACON!!!
<cachi01> blablablabla dark side blblablablabla anakin
<otakon> Apprentice kills the MASTER
<VenHur96> Anyone remember that guy from the 2D Clone Wars cartoon I mentioned yesterday?
<Reikim> Blot doesn't sound right. Too masculine.
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: i mean from here to the end
<BronyInstrumental> wait.....that sounded like palpatine
<Vivix> Explaning everything is a nerd thing, a lot of things are better left unexplained in stories
<TrueDerpyHooves> wooooooohooooooo
<otakon> THEN he gets his own apprentice and it continues
<RosePetal1> I loves your hair.
<TrueDerpyHooves> dat hair
<XylemTube> PALPATINE'S BEHIND IT ALL
<Shizuka> 13BronyInstrumental: naaaaaah couldn't be
<appleclouds> boring part
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: but now it sounds like it is biotic powers like from mass effect
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Where did he get that scar on his face?
<RosePetal1> Then there is a crazy scene.
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Naw, she's probably in her third tri right now.
<TrueDerpyHooves> BBBBOOOOOOOORRRRIINNNNGGG:O
<Reikim> Here, you guys build her a character. I'll only ever have to show bits and pieces of it, anyway.
<Ryunosuke> brushie brushie brushie
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: like you have to be born with the ability to use it instead of just intense training
<RosePetal1> Clone wars.
<StinkomanFan> In the Lego Games there WAS no boring parts
<TrueDerpyHooves> :)
<Spectrum_Rush> ugh god the dialog hurts my soul -_-
<XylemTube> BOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: mass effect was after and i didnt play it. doesnt sound bad
<Reikim> The rest of the fandom has always been better at making up OCs.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :'( It's a TRAP!!!
<RustyMeat> fuck you
<StinkomanFan> Or romantic sub-plots
<lollerguy> nope
<cratorkid> filler- drink
<TrueDerpyHooves> :):)dawww
<appleclouds> lol
<RosePetal1> That's because it's Lego. Legos are always funny.
<Sabershy> Woman...
<Obsidian> blah blah blah
<Fou_Lou> Vivix: i agree. But i dont care. Especially if a world is build through the storys
<Spriggals> Fun Fact: Thats a wig he's wearing
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: they never said everyone could be a jedi in the Ot either
<cachi01> is the force unleashed canon in the timeline?
<RosePetal1> Crazy Dreamn.
<Shooeie> Dont Jedis get spayed and neutered?
<BronyInstrumental> Shizuka: i seriously can't tell if you're serious or not, never seen any SW movies
<Kandarihu> The thing is, the midichlorian explanation removes any semblance of plausible deniability to the Force.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> try out Maas Effect it's awesome
<TrueDerpyHooves> and then there was plot
<Shizuka> 13previously on general hospital
<Obsidian> Foreshadowing
<lollerguy> oh lord
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Notice the massive baby bump they're trying to give her? She's probably supposed to be third trimester.
<Dark92Enigma> PREMONTION?
<RosePetal1> What was that?
<Tovler> >mfw mst3k guys mentioned Lego Star Wars in this.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Buffer!

<Dark92Enigma> The buffer is strong in this one
<CriticKitten> Aaaaaand screenie.

<RosePetal1> Dat buffer inside him.

<PinkiePieYoshi64> Want me to screenshot it? xDDDDD
<Pinkies4thWall> I just saw this in my head. Pinkie sees Mace Windu. Says, "HEY EVERYPONY! THIS JEDI IS REALLY, REALLY BALD!"
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Man Anikin works out
<Bronysith> OGOD
<PinkiePieYoshi64> nevermind lol
<RosePetal1> What the?
<Ryunosuke> I think shizuka is just looking at his nipples
<Vivix> Ha
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> damn wtf
<Meanwhile> Oh yeah that's a better buffer image.
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> WTF
<VenHur96> Guys, let's just say one thing, at least there's no more Jar Jar Blinks after this.
<TrueDerpyHooves> DAMN
<RosePetal1> Buffer cannot handle it.

<PinkiePieYoshi64> sweet :D
<Shooeie> Arent Jedis spayed and neutered?
<Vivix> Sits up in bed
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Be honest did anyone care for Jar Jar
<Dark92Enigma> AT NIGHT
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I didnt
<Vivix> jesus this is like soap opera acting
<TrueDerpyHooves> he just got laid >:3
<Obsidian> SpadeMagnes[R]: no
<Vivix> though--might stil lbe good
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: didja get that one or no?
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: not a goddamn soul
<JESmith71> Actually Jar Jar shows up briefly in the ending
<RosePetal1> Then he starts dremaing again.
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush: I got it
<lollerguy> augmented arm
<JESmith71> Doesn't say nothing though
<Tovler> I missed Jar Jar while watching episode 2.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I cared for Jar Jar... until he messed up in Ep. 2...
<lollerguy> *deus ex*
<Ryunosuke> at least he's wearing pants
<Spectrum_Rush> good man otakon
<Fou_Lou> VenHur96: but there will ewoks -.-
<RosePetal1> Good thing.
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush: ofc :)
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], not to my knowle... hey, Vordox liked him, right?
<RosePetal1> Beautfiul city.
<Ryunosuke> be kinda awkward to buffer with him with his pants down
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: I've had enough of Star Wars buffers damnit.
<TrueDerpyHooves> heyo
<Dark92Enigma> JESmith71: but does he TALK? (i hope NOT)
*VenHur96 suddently shivers over the Eworks cartoon
<Meanwhile> Being an ink blot.
<Spectrum_Rush> otakon: make sure to share it ;)
<RustyMeat> ive had a wet dream again
<Dark92Enigma> I HAD A PREMONTION
<Ryunosuke> oh god
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush: I shall, hold on
<RosePetal1> Good thing we won't see Ewoks cartoons.
<Fou_Lou> PinkiePieYoshi64: the ones who gave him political power messed up. a moron could see that hes easylie manipulated and just not up for the task
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6472579584
<Midnight_Fyre> PinkiePieYoshi64: I cared for Jar Jar until he opened his mouth, which was about .5 seconds after he was introduced
<twilight_sprinkle> A dream, within a dream...
<TrueDerpyHooves> it was a dream.... hair flick*
<Ryunosuke> rustymeat had a wet dream, no wonder he is rusty
<Dark92Enigma> twilight_sprinkle: INCEPTION?
<TrueDerpyHooves> o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o
<Vivix> I saw jar jar when I was like 12?
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark92Enigma: BWOOOONG
<Vivix> I don't remember if I liked the movie
<Dark92Enigma> BRB
<Vivix> I don't think we watched it all
<RosePetal1> Star Wars I came out when I was 6 or 7.
<Vivix> the original?
<RosePetal1> More sappy kissing.
<RosePetal1> Less kissing more action.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> .....so is that why he doesn't like his son?
<Vivix> kissing > action
<TrueDerpyHooves> kiiiiiiisssssssss NUUUUU
<Tovler> I remember watching this movie only because I wanted to see how this schlocky series would end.
<Vivix> but this is s..not great
<TrueDerpyHooves> FAIL
<Pinkies4thWall> Guys. I need my daily olive fix
<StinkomanFan> HOW IS BABBY FORMED?

<Spectrum_Rush> nice Lil_B
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: i do like haydens voice though...

<TrueDerpyHooves> green guy with a robe in a dimly lit room, seems legit
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Hey recaption that and say that I am iron man
<Midnight_Fyre> Lil_B: :D
<lollerguy> yoader
<Gaston> FORESHADOWING
<Reikim2> Okay, random DC
<lollerguy> oh dear
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: you cant argue with those whos vision is blurred by the classics
<Reikim2> Did anything good get thought of during that time?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: eh, even De Lancies voice doesnt amaze me that much
<CriticKitten> ....wat
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: This^^^^^
<lollerguy> TRAIN
<pony_9979> sdsds
<CriticKitten> "Attachment leads to jealousy!" Bullshit.
<lollerguy> ishggydggy
<PinkiePieYoshi64> TRAIN... your dragon!
<Lil_B> thanks PaladinDrakkenwolf Spectrum_Rush and Midnight_Fyre :)
<CriticKitten> In no way does that make sense.
<lollerguy> :|
<Meanwhile> No not really.
<TrixieMuffin> shit , everything leads to the dark side , why not just cut the crap and all become sith ?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: it does if you want it to...
<lollerguy> MOAR ACTION
<lollerguy> YES
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Minky(i think this is a fabric or something) Miriam Pie ?
<Vivix> I don't like actioon
<Ryunosuke> didnt Revan say the same thing during the mandalorian wars?
<TrueDerpyHooves> :P
<Vivix> the best action movie I've seen is eh..Die hard
<cachi01> ACTION FTW
<Vivix> was not expecting to like it
<Gaston> action is good and bad
<Shizuka> 13in short, he has a bad feeling about this
<Kandarihu> TrixieMuffin, not everything.
<Tovler> I'm not your Buddy, Pal-patine
<otakon> http://postimage.org/image/cc55kvfpb/ for those who were too slow
*Pinkies4thWall returns with olives, a fork, and a quart of water
<Gaston> good to watch, bad to movie
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: it had pretty clever action
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: i think most of the hate against the prequesl orinigates on the love of the classics. But most forget no new film could be even with the classics
<Meanwhile> Minky is slang in England for something that isn't clean.
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Who cares Gerge Lucas made a lot of moey and that's all he cared about
<RosePetal1> Lol.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: No, it doesn't. :p Attachment leads to greed and coveting, NOT jealousy.
<Vivix> Yeah, Die Hard was way more fun than I thought it would be
<Ryunosuke> "jedi are sitting and waiting while the outer rim burns"
<RosePetal1> We got to have MONEY.
<Vivix> I wonder what happened to action to take that away
<lollerguy> oh noes
<Reikim2> Minky sounds good
<Jim> Minty?
<Reikim2> Minty's taken
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well i dunno don't know slangs
<Pinkies4thWall> RosePetal1: MUNNEH
<Reikim> Wait
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: someone always has more than you or something you want, if you get attached to material things that creates jealousy
<Reikim> Is that true Meanwhile?
<TrueDerpyHooves> GAH ADD
<Meanwhile> Yes.
<Shizuka> 13moar powerpoint transitions!
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: still better actor than kristen stewart...
<Tovler> You can hear how overwhelmed he is
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: you also lose things while others dont
<Reikim> Well so much for that
<Midnight_Fyre> Yes, your bland line delivery clearly shows how overwhelmed you are
<RosePetal1> Gasp.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: at least he has facial expressions
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: But that's an indirect relationship, and it's based firmly in greed.
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: yeah and its become self-indcuing, hating the prequels is a trend at this point
<RosePetal1> There are spirits.
<Vivix> you can have attachment without greed
<lollerguy> 2BLEK
<RosePetal1> Mace Windu.
<Tovler> Kristen Stewart's ok for a method actor.
<Ryunosuke> uh oh
<Shizuka> 13waaaaaa it's unfair!
<XylemTube> aniken is a real dickhead
<Ryunosuke> you should have just said, yes
<CriticKitten> SHUT UP.
<lollerguy> SAI WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<TrueDerpyHooves> o-O
<Ryunosuke> and thank you
<Gaston> great acting
<Bronysith> LIFE ISNT FAIR BITCH
<Vivix> I kinda enjoyed Twilight, but Kristen Stewart really has only one face
<Pinkies4thWall> Ki-Adi-Mundi's head disturbs me
<Vivix> and that is SQUINT
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: its indirect, but thats already dangerous for a jedi
<TrueDerpyHooves> TAKe A SEAT
<Midnight_Fyre> It's not fair :'(
<Tovler> this is outrageou…zzzzzzzzz
<CriticKitten> BOO FUCKING HOO. D:<
<Bronysith> TAKE A SEAT but dont sit down
<Ryunosuke> because you dont know everything skywalker
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: the kid in ep 1?
<RosePetal1> WAH WAH! Why can't I be in the council? Wah wah!
<TrueDerpyHooves> :|take a seat
<RustyMeat> listen to samule L
<lollerguy> niqqa
<Lil_B> Son I'm dissapoint
<RustyMeat> sit down
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: what no. i mean hayden
<Reikim> Worst part of character creation is naming, swear to God
<Reikim> It's worse with ponies too
<Vivix> Oh god this is hitting star trek levels of weird
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*ahem*
<Jim> Agreed
<RosePetal1> Slient you.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: kristen stewart has no facial expressions
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Cry about it that will make a difference
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Ze WOOKIES!!!!! :D
<VenHur96> Shut and take yo' seat!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14CRAAAAAAAAAAAAWLING IN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Jedi Master Chris Hansen.
<Bronysith> THIS IS WHY I AM A SITH
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: whos kristen stewart
<Tovler> Was Kristen ok in Adventure Land?
<RosePetal1> At least Hayden tries to show emotions TRIES.
<Ryunosuke> Yoda is going to Kashyyk to find a star map!
<Shizuka> 13baaaawwwwww
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: i most probably dont hate the prequels because i didnt grew up with the classics and doesnt have the loved view of the classics
<Vivix> Bella in Twilight
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: No, Yoda's just speaking in too many absolutes, is all. :P
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: the bitch from twilight i think
<XylemTube> shaddap bitch
<Spectrum_Rush> uh Ki-adi mundi was a knight on the council anakin so stop you bitching :|
<RosePetal1> Did you hear about the affair?>
<Shizuka> 13anakin never asked for this
<Pinkies4thWall> Kashyyyk is spelled WEIRD.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And as we know, only a Sith deals in absolutes.
<Obsidian> "How could this happen to me"~
<TrueDerpyHooves> o-o-o-o-o
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: its a well-known monk philosophy to not be attached to material things
<StinkomanFan> IN THE LEGO GAMES THEY JUST SKIPPED TO YODA'S ADVENTURE WITH CHEWIE
<RosePetal1> I was never prepared for this?
<Gaston> anikin is such a bitch
<Reikim> Any other brilliant ideas? I need brilliant ideas to make up for my own lack of brilliance.
<cachi01> a bitch anakin is
<otakon> http://cheezburger.com/6476540672
<Gaston> indeed
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: its not absolutes, its just a danger, they dont kick you out for having some attachments, its just warnings
<otakon> and one caption later
<Tovler> Kristen cheated on Robert. I was so heartbroken
<Shizuka> 13i'm sorry guys, the stream seems to have switched to desperate housejedis again
<otakon> Shizuka: lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> xD
<Vivix> hehe
<otakon> and guess what guys?
<cachi01> xDD
<Midnight_Fyre> Enough with the frigging boring space politics!
<Gaston> otakon: LOL
<Vivix> Are the original old ones the same?
<mitamaking> Gueaa who'a back, back again, guess who's back, tell a friend
<Obsidian> So much drama
<VenHur96> Let's all agree Kid Anakin is better than that Anakin. <---
<lollerguy> THAT ANAKIN IS A SPY!
<otakon> IT STILL HAS ANOTHER hour and thirty left!
<Pinkies4thWall> THE ANI IS A SPY
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: yeah, i feel about the same
<Gaston> he is a sith
<Tovler> I could be watching GCB instead of this.
<Lil_B> Shizuka at least it's not Curescant Shores
<JESmith71> Vader is best Anakin
<Gaston> lord
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: :(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sure the chancilor laughs like a mad man but he cant be evil
<mitamaking> You know, the jedis really f***ed up here
<XylemTube> dat lame duck senator
<RosePetal1> No, he's evill. EVIL@
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: ive never seen twilight
<Gaston> tardis
<VenHur96> Eeeeviiiill!
<otakon> Midnight_Fyre: 1h30m...yeah of this.
<Shizuka> 13Lil_B: brrr.... orange spiky haired morons armed with lightsabers...
<Vivix> Oh so this GUY becomes Darth Vader?
<Gaston> EEEEEVVVIIILLLL!!!!
<otakon> JUST DO IT
<Kandarihu> I can take the politics. I lasted all the way through Legend of Galactic Heroes. Now THAT's some serious space politics.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: imagine super botoxed girl
<lollerguy> DO IT FAGGOT
<VenHur96> Vivix: Eeyup.
<TrixieMuffin> We are at war ....that justifys treason Anakin
<Midnight_Fyre> otakon: :'(:'(:'(
<Vivix> Woo
<RosePetal1> Just do it!
<Vivix> Okay now I am a little interested
<XylemTube> facepalm
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: absolutely no facial expressions. "i am so happy" no smile
<Gaston> that's what she said
<Lil_B> Shizuka yes... and teenage-Problems
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ok now I'm convinced that fiery joker not being a Brony is an act
<lollerguy> :)
<PinkiePieYoshi64> A Republic Gunship in regular traffic... where's the crime! :O
<SpadeMagnes[R]> How is Anakin the chosen one agin?
<RosePetal1> Teenage Angst problems.
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: the classics have their flaws too. I found the ewoks about the same annoing than jarjar and the trench flight scene isnt that plausible either
<StinkomanFan> When the LEGO ADAPTATION IS MORE FUN FOR ADULTS THAN THE MOVIE YOU HAVE MADE A SHITTY MOVIE
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: http://cheezburger.com/6457506304
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: like a droid :P
<Kandarihu> Except I had to rewind through more than half of the dialog.
<Midnight_Fyre> Well, at least it's stil slightly better than Attack of the Clones
<Tovler> dangerous putting them together, like diet coke and mentos
<RosePetal1> Because ....
<TrixieMuffin> FINALLY
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: a droic has more emotion
<Bronysith> droid
<Gaston> did they go to the department of mysteries or something?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does the Drop ship have a name or something?
<mitamaking> StinkomanFan: Or the legos are just really fun, just saying, those games are fun
<RosePetal1> Chewbacca.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Republic Gunship is best ship
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I have a toy of one
<CriticKitten> Ironic fact: he ends up fulfilling the prophecy by killing Palpatine, thereby "destroying the Sith".
<Shizuka> 13zzzzzzzzz
<Shizuka> 13this movie...
<Gaston> ^
<CriticKitten> Just way too late to save anyone. :D
<Pinkies4thWall> Speak as Yoda does, One does not simply.
<Spectrum_Rush> Bronysith: a stoic has more emotion
<TrueDerpyHooves> lol
<RosePetal1> lol.
<Midnight_Fyre> SaxyPretender: What about friendship?
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: yeah. i also enjoy the political arguments and the character development in the prequels, is wall as their portrayal of love being potentially evil, which is quite innovative for movies
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I have 2 Titanium Gunships :P
<Vivix> This movie LOOKS kinda cheap-
<Gaston> lord
<Gaston> of
<Gaston> the
<StinkomanFan> mitamaking, I was talking about the Lego sets
<Gaston> rings
<Shizuka> 13if it wouldn't drastically increase the likelihood the stream would derp i'd go back to minecraft right now >>
<RosePetal1> What is up with that hat?
<Spriggals> PEW PEW, SEX SEX, RAWR RAWR

<mitamaking> StinkomanFan: says the pony fan then
<Tovler> destroying the principles more than 100 colombine kids.
<Lil_B> at this point I wouldn't mind a Action Scene out of nowjere without purpose and reason
<Alpha-Omega-Prime> Who wants lord of the rings instead?
<RosePetal1> Don't listen to him.
<CriticKitten> Don't ask me to act!

<Gaston> best line in the movie: "not the younglings!"
<RosePetal1> I do what I want!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Do it
<twilight_sprinkle> i never understood what he said there
<Shizuka> 13not a single luxury...
<TrueDerpyHooves> COME ON!

<SaxyPretender> 0,14no, Republic Gunship is XD
<TrueDerpyHooves> plotting *trololol*
<Vivix> Who wrote this!?
<Tovler> I'm not sure I like this more than the other prequels now.
<Gaston> haha she said plot
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: good thing in the prequel is that they arent black and white. The calssics pretty much are (empire evil rebels good).
<RosePetal1> Ah, the city.
<Tovler> even John Williams is bored
<PinkiePieYoshi64> No plots?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Tovler: Well Said :D
<Spectrum_Rush> uh you've been "in love" throughout the entire war and not before
<Reikim> Ah well, so much for that
<GabeMoist> Bubbles!
<RosePetal1> Running Running talking and no action.
<RosePetal1> BUBBLES!
<Ryunosuke> Blitzball!
<TrueDerpyHooves> o-o
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: yeah that too. some people complain and say "everyone is a villain", which isnt even true, but it doesntt even sound bad to me
<Shooeie> Dat bubble
<VenHur96> ...Anyone is interested in a Star Wars MMO?
<Gaston> it gets good around the.... oh wait it doesn't
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: right here i think it was intended that sidious made anakin...
<Obsidian> F****** bubbles!
<Vivix> there is a star wars mmo
<Meanwhile> They grew up on a rock farm
<Bronysith> VenHur96: i played it. it was decent
<Shizuka> 13so they're going to just sit in those theater seats and make fun of the show? what jerks!
<lollerguy> pls dont end the war :c
<Ryunosuke> VenHur96, not after SWG
<Meanwhile> How about something crystalline.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Pebbles
<VenHur96> F'ing BUBBLES!
<lollerguy> no war means no action
<Vivix> MMO is bad because ..they have npc's instead of 100% player run
<Vivix> just makes it uninteresting
<Reikim> ...Saxy, you're a genius.
<Midnight_Fyre> Seriously, this dialog is starting to hurt my brain
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: made him turn you mean?
<RosePetal1> Leave!
<Meanwhile> That's a kid from the Flinstones.
<Tovler> UUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

<Tovler> music derail
<SaxyPretender> 0,14rare, but they exist
<RosePetal1> What do these bubbles do?
<Lil_B> "and don't claim refunds for your tickets later"
<Pinkies4thWall> anyone remember on the cartoon network show, the clone wars, grievous' ship, the malevolence?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Just like that? those guys didn't ask questions? :O
<Meanwhile> You dingleberry.
<Spectrum_Rush> sooo... how is that an opera
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: no that he used the midochlorians to create life

<Pinkies4thWall> had HUGE ASS ion cannons on the sides?
<Ryunosuke> Kandarihu, they spend half the CGI budget on that concert :p
<Shizuka> 13dat hyperbole
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: there was no father...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Rocky =P
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: i like it. Because everyone has pretty much their own goals. and they trick and manipulate each other. thats pretty cool. And the development of anaking through the movies is actualy pretty good
<Shizuka> 13anakin is like.... mating with the idiot ball by now
<Reikim> That's what I named my Geodude when I was ten.
<StinkomanFan> In the Lego games Grand Master Tarkoff couldn't do anything but jump
<SaxyPretender> 0,14eww
<Lil_B> I hate that freaking everybody is asking anikin "explore your feelings"
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: nahh, he cant create life, he can only preserve it with tech sttuff
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: him and the Idiot Ball are one and the same
<CriticKitten> And at no point does Anakin ask "how do you know that?"
<Vivix> the political and stuff might be good
<SpadeMagnes[R]> A brick is smarter than Anakin
<Obsidian> He knows they know
<RustyMeat> ohorriblre lier
<Gaston> LET THE HATE FLOW THROUGH YOU. DO NOT HESITATE. AND YOUR TRANSFORMATION TO THE DARK SIDE WILL BE COMPLETE.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Your thoughts are LOUD Anikan...
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: yeah definitely
<Vivix> but the love and personal scenes are just- painful
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> quartz ?
<XylemTube> why did the chosen one have to be such a moron?
<Tovler> I knew the emperor was called Palpatine before I saw episode 1 so I was at a huge disadvantage for being surprised by anything in this.
<Obsidian> inb4 bullshit
<cachi01> XylemTube: he is not the chosen one thats why
<SaxyPretender> 0,14same, Tovler
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Soon there will be little baby idiot balls bouncing around

<Bronysith> i use passion for power lol
<Shizuka> 13don't remind me ><
<Fou_Lou> nobody is selfless
<Reikim> Yeah, Mica sounds nice.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> God even a Ewok is more competent than Anakin!
<CriticKitten> ....sorry, threw up a little in my mouth at the thought of Hayden nude.
<Vivix> who is Hayden?
<Midnight_Fyre> Do we really have to hear it?
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: atleast those ones are good

<otakon> Now, you get to see some kickass stuff

<LadyCanary> He looks like a mix of Deadman and the dude from Hellraiser.
<VenHur96> cachi01: Same
<Vivix> I am always up for cuddles Saturn!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: That's not jealousy, that's paranoia. It's not THAT hard to recognize the difference.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat robe....
<Alchemist> Saturn: are you up early or are you up still?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat Mount
<Shizuka> 13pointless random animal is go

<LadyCanary> Wark wark wark.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Mount speed 200
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: What with them being entirely different emotions prompted by entirely different things.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: its jealousy, paranoia is fear of someone being after you...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14man, I hate the noise it makes
<Tovler> Wawawawa lizard is the new OOOOOOOOOO car
<RosePetal1> Wa War Warble Warble.

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Time to do that Raid
<RosePetal1> Dows nobody hear that animal?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> MAAAAAUUULLLLPPP!!!!
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: i would rather use the word angry than jealous. But its easy to put the fault on someone else when you cant see your own errors. Since he himself was turning Padme against him
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :P
<otakon> cool lizard
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: .... how is it paranoia, when paranoia is what i said...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Obi Wan is gonna steal all the loot
<Shizuka> 13it must have like... a nat 1000 in sneak
<otakon> I shall name him Henry!
<LadyCanary> Ohai Grievous. You should really stop smoking.
<Nyst> What point does the lizard serve?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Where's Fluttershy when you need her?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: He's afraid that Obi-Wan got to her and convinced her to turn against him. That is textbook paranoia.
<Shizuka> 13for them to not hear it coming a mile away
<otakon> HENRY YOU ARE SO AWESOME!
<LadyCanary> None, Nyst
<Alchemist> Lil_B and you too. No one is getting any sleep tonight?

<Ryunosuke> where does he get all those robes?
<Pinkies4thWall> LOL
<Meanwhile> otakon: You got one earlier.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: it wouldve been paranoia if it didnt already happen, instead his jealousy made him think it was Obiwan
<VenHur96> Uh... I still have maintenance...
<Obsidian> Sneak fail
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wheres the Tank?
<RosePetal1> lol now your trapped!

<RosePetal1> Kill him!
<twilight_sprinkle> Obsidian: not fail, its a plan
<Lil_B> Alchemist well... so true XD, this movie will end at 6 am for me

<RosePetal1> Oh wait I can do this.
<Pinkies4thWall> DED
<LadyCanary> ...Jees.
<RosePetal1> He
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And no, paranoia is simply an irrational fear based on misleading or non-existent evidence. It's most definitely paranoia.
<Shooeie> Shoot him...
<otakon> wait I thought decapitating them did nothing?
<RosePetal1> Oh really?
<XylemTube> the dead guy?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> OMG!!!
<Meanwhile> That's cheating.

<Tovler> Korra has better arms than him
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat Rotor blade :O
<LadyCanary> He's compensating for the things he does not have.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Yes it is. How can you possibly claim it's not?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: actually he's a cyborg
<SpadeMagnes[R]> SO BLURRY
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: up still
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: He's not really a droid though.

<otakon> at least a cool fight is coming up
<Cypresswolf> aww..I missed tonight's movies :(
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> oh hai Phase4
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: he says " you turned her against me", in his mind she already has, because she didnt agree with him
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And he responds with irrationally claiming that she brought Obi-Wan there to kill him.
<Tovler> I wish I could sense a plot
<Wrek|Observiking> 05the death star was originally the good guys design
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: That is most definitely an irrational fear.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05that the empire stole
<Wrek|Observiking> 05:P
<lollerguy> :c
<Cypresswolf> I just got back from Target - new pony toys are out :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wait what was the purpouse of the station orgionaly?
<Vivix> Wrek, why are you awake? Vacation hours?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: are you kidding me.
<RosePetal1> Ki Mundi.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Wrek|Observiking: but wasnt it already from the bad guys?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Spoilers much?
<Alchemist> Saturn: I think a week ago you said that some firm(?) wanted additional charges for stuff for BUCK and you were to go to negotiate with them to Manchaster(?) with a few friends.
<LadyCanary> Wreky :3
<RosePetal1> Lol nice room.
<Tovler> the yoda who cried "Dark"
<cachi01> Cypresswolf: still looking shitty as always?
<RosePetal1> It's all black and dark looking.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why does he look like some one from Hogwarts?
<lollerguy> lel
<appleclouds> lol
<Lil_B> YES! more Anekin whining
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: he.said. "you turnED her against me", he already choked her to death because he thought she had betrayed him, he thought obiwan already turned her
<Vivix> Same budget on costumes
<RosePetal1> More whining.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> STOP WHINNING!!!!
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6465247232
<Obsidian> Wrek|Observiking: Technically the chancellor's playing both sides so it was never in "good" hands
<appleclouds> one hour!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> THIS IS WHINING
<Midnight_Fyre> :'( = Anakin
<PinkiePieYoshi64> OOOH
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Watch the film, you obviously didn't the last time. :p The ending sequence is very, very clear. She goes there to try to get him to come back to her, Obi-Wan shows up, Anakin says "You brought him here to kill me". That is irrational fear speaking. Paranoia.
<otakon> idiot
<Tovler> more awkwardly edited silence
<PinkiePieYoshi64> THE HARNESS IS TOO TIGHT~!!!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> AND SO IS THIS CHAIN!!
<RosePetal1> Enough with the flamewar.
<Cypresswolf> cachi01: actually they look pretty good - Shining Armor & Cadence castle set, Rainbow glittery blind bag ponies with the green male pony is out too
<pony_102> HIS SITH LORD :O
<PinkiePieYoshi64> CAN'T YOU LOOSENE IT? :'(
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: It's only AFTER that sequence that the "you turned her against me" bit even comes up.
<otakon> PinkiePieYoshi64: gently please?
<Vivix> Sounds like nonspecific paranoia
<RosePetal1> Look at that rocky wall.
<Wrek|Observiking> 05Obsidian: true but the separatists could be counted as the gooder guys seeign as the empire is born from the republic
<otakon> ofc he does you IDIOT!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> otakon: okay :P
<otakon> hiya Wrek|Observiking
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why is Anakin listening to this monkey?
<RosePetal1> Suspicous.
<Bronysith> WHATS WITH THE SHOT REVERSE SHOT?!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> SpadeMagnes[R]: bad writers
<RosePetal1> To be cool.
<Obsidian> Maybe
<Tovler> circle strafing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> why are they going around in circles?
<CriticKitten> Spade: Because he's full tilt idiot now.
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek|Observiking: except for the fact that the seperatists were a design of Sidious and well... spoillers
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> Now...kill palpatine!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> nope
<RosePetal1> What you say to me?!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> To me I belive there is no true good and evil
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Falco: Are you gonna listen to that monkey?!! Boss: Ahh... you're not as stupid as YOU LOOK!!!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: didnt you see his reaction when she said obiwan told her?? what kind of critic are you if you cant see obvious acting??
<pony_102> KILL IT

<appleclouds> kill him!
<Stormfox> KILL HIM NOW BOY
<pony_102> KILL IT NOW

<RosePetal1> DO IT!
<Alchemist> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2: for dramatic effect
<otakon> He's not gonna do it
<otakon> I know it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dont do it
<XylemTube> Incapacitate him!
<pony_102> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<otakon> you know it
<Wrek|Observiking> 05just quickly jab right now anakin!
<Wrek|Observiking> 05in the throat!½
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Do it
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Kill him now: episode 4 -6 cancelled
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Kill him!
<Midnight_Fyre> Kill him now and end the movie
<Shizuka> 13oh god he's enjoying this
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: The kind who watches the movie and pays attention? You need to watch the end of this film more carefully. I suggest you do so when it comes up. :P
<PinkiePieYoshi64> He's a PERV!!!
<RosePetal1> He won't do it. Because how will he explain to the other Jeid?
<Obsidian> He doesn't because he is a moron
<PinkiePieYoshi64> KILL HIM!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> creepy
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: eewwwww

<dalekahn> Lick it. Lick the lightsaber
<pony_102> damn u anakin :(
<Lil_B> I can taste you anger... it tastes bittersweed!
<Kandarihu> Anakin's ears: successfully tickled.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: and he had paranoia of her dying and jealousy of her being with obiwan
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek|Observiking: If he did that, there would be no original trilogy.
<Obsidian> He's getting off on this. 0.O
<Stormfox> this is again WHY varder is better
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> Anakin FU°! -_-
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why doesnt Anakin just... I dont know.. LEAVE?!
<Wrek|Observiking> 05yeah thats why i told him to jab him
<RosePetal1> At least tie him up and then kill him when the rest of the jedi show up!
<Spectrum_Rush> funny you should say that Nittany_Discord
<Derpy_Hooves> oh oh oh Shizuka is this the part where that one part happens?
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: bc he's afraid for Padme and the visions of her death
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ugh..
<Shizuka> 13still not as good a chase scene as OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO wubwubwubWUBWUBWUBWUB
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I really like that Lizard's Mane!
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: ok im done. ill enjoy yhe movie, you can continue ignoring obvious things and hating it because you want to for the next hour.
<Tovler> John Williams is being narcoleptic it seems.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: There is no indication whatsoever of her and Obi-Wan. His motivation is pure paranoia. :p
<otakon> GO HENRY GO!
<RosePetal1> We need some epic music!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> WAAUUULLLPP!!!!

<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I hate it because it's bad. You like it because you didn't pay attention. That's cool, I agree to disagree with you.
<RosePetal1> The original had very epic music.

<LadyCanary> SO! Who wants marshmallows?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> hehehe
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: do you hate it because YOU find it bad or because it is considered bad?
<Pinkies4thWall> So uncivilized.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> But a pistol did..
<otakon> I've never seen that happen to anyone else shot with a blaster
*Bronysith glomps LadyCanary
<Shooeie> Call OCP

<CriticKitten> Fou_Lou: Objectively and subjectively, it is not at the quality level it should and could have been. It's better than the first two, though. :p
<Kandarihu> You know, technically, we're engaged in internet piracy, and probably the only one who cares would be Comcast.
<RosePetal1> They are looking at the buffer.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Shizuka: :(
<cachi01> can someone tell me why am i still in MAINTENANCE?

<Shizuka> 13clearly the comcast derps are a sign that i should go back to building my elevators...

<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: not to mention he had no clue of politics
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: Cox be my latter name.
<CriticKitten> Should have brought him along. Then Anakin would have seen the Jedi killed in front of him and would have more likely sided with you, Windu, you dipshit. >_>

<Bronysith> Lil_B: yup
<Dark92Enigma> DARTH VADER
<RosePetal1> dun dun du dun dun du dun dun.
<Meanwhile> :P
<CriticKitten> Apparently Palpatine frying his face also gave him a robotic voice
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: btw did you see anakins face there?
<lollerguy> OH SHIT :O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spectrum_Rush: Not my intention.
<dalekahn> buffer
<Sumica> 00,10not sure if want a Bronysith taco
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yea
<SpadeMagnes[R]> PING
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> diiiiding
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: what they did with the shadow
<Lil_B> Rise from your Grave
<Nightflames> :O
<CrazyHippie1234> The Darth Vader Rises
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: even better
<appleclouds> party hard
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: it was brilliant
<XylemTube> Vader was NOT this stupid in episode 4-6
<RosePetal1> Yoda sensing death.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yea it was.
<Pinkies4thWall> inb4 order 66
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Is Palpatine possesed or something?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: hayden is good as an emo brat
<JESmith71> Xylem maybe he Vader got smarter over the years?
<Tovler> heh, Palpitoad is a Pokemon and Ash owns one.
<Lil_B> Yoda man, you aren't looking so well dude
<RosePetal1> He fried his throat that's why.
<appleclouds> luna is missing all the movie :(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So he got smoker lungs?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: yeah lol, but the point of the shadow was more to demonstrate the split as well of emegrence of the darkness
<Fou_Lou> SpadeMagnes[R]: nope but the dark side came out
*Dark92Enigma Darth Vader is walking through that door........he just left Mace Windu crashing through the floor (that's the lyrics)
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: yup
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: and epic scene incoming
<Vivix> he looks like David Gilmour after he aged
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wasnt Palpatine evil even during the clone wars?
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: not obviously, no
<Obsidian> SpadeMagnes[R]: He was playing both sides
<RosePetal1> Not sure.
<CriticKitten> Vader apparently has no goddamn will of his own. >_>
<RosePetal1> Enough!
<Lil_B> funny... Civil War happened anyways... an the only 2 Jedis left weren't there
<Fou_Lou> SpadeMagnes[R]: palpatinewas a sith lord inEp1 too
<Fou_Lou> SpadeMagnes[R]: he was a sith all the time
<GabeMoist> SpadeMagnes[R], he's always been evil, his evil has only now been exposed
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: he was still acting like a chansellro but secretly evil
<Pinkies4thWall> I never liked Nute Gunray
<CrazyHippie1234> "PEACE"
<Vivix> I just adore that dancing-
<twilight_sprinkle> peace nro
<Tovler> when I have phlegm in my throat, my voice sounds deep and epic.
<RosePetal1> He's now pee.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Under a tyranical rule
<Midnight_Fyre> Because that face just screams "peace"
<CriticKitten> Peace through slaughter. DERP HERP OKAY MASTER
<RosePetal1> Army coming.
<Kandarihu> "Peace in our time! Hooray!"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Peace through death.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why is Anakin just going along with this?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14'sup 501st?
<RosePetal1> Peace through killing innocents. Seems legit.
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[R]: Because he's a fucking idiot.
<appleclouds> now his official Darth Vader
<pony_8375> so begin the galactic empire
<Midnight_Fyre> Because he is stupid
<Obsidian> Peace by killing children
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: his mind is warped at this point
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: "from my point of view the jedi are evil" coming from the guy who just murdered a bunch of children. you have to admit that line is stupid
<CriticKitten> Spade: Because ....Meanwhile got it
<RosePetal1> You mean younglings.
<Fou_Lou> SpadeMagnes[R]: because he belives palpatine
<Squallken> this is why the Nightswatch never have girlfriends
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: dont forget that palpatine is a sith and can use mind influence
<Spectrum_Rush> SaxyPretender: AWW YEAH
<Dark92Enigma> Doesn't he remember that little ''PEACE'' parade at the end of Ep I? NEITHER DO I
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: the dark side corrupts
<RosePetal1> GO!
<Pinkies4thWall> SaxyPretender: eh, nnothing. just a little massacre tonight.
<Vivix> Isn't that the kinda writing that gets fanfics thumbs down?
<Pudge> look at dat cgi
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also why would you program a order that kills all the jedi into all the clones?
<CrazyHippie1234> I like how they all miss Obiwan
<Kandarihu> Ending a conflict through the genocide of one side. It's among the worst forms of peace.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: So can Jedi. :p
<RosePetal1> Little does he know.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Execution Order 66... *Looks up in guidebook* Hmm... this is the code for a Universal Ponyfied Takeover.... :D :D :D :O :D :D :D
<GabeMoist> Palpatine has mind tricks powerful enough he could probably control jabba
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: same thing i just said to spade, that and Anakin is still afraid to lose padme
<CriticKitten> Spade: Because Deus Ex
<appleclouds> code 66
<HellsFortune> EXECUTE ORDER 66
<Sabershy> Excecute Order 66!
<RosePetal1> NO!
<Pinkies4thWall> ORDER66
<Dark92Enigma> Little does he know...........IT'S ATRAP
<Tovler> Commander Keen
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WHO WOULD PROGRAM THAT
<XylemTube> order 666
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: he pretty much just lying to himself now
<Darf14> oh ****!
<Lil_B> "Damn i just gave him back his lightsaber"
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S A TRAP
<RosePetal1> How can they do this!
<JESmith71> Becuase the higher ground gives you the whatever increase that joke talked about
<CrazyHippie1234> MISS!
<Fou_Lou> SpadeMagnes[R]: because the Clones werent ordered by the jedi
<Obsidian> Order 66 -Instant betrayal
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> NO, Not the Lizard!!!
<otakon> NO HENRY NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Midnight_Splendor> Man where did the storm trooper go from badass soldiers to can barely hit the side of a barn.
<Darf14> Traitors! :O

<PinkiePieYoshi64> NOOO!!!! Not that lizard!!! :o
<otakon> R.I.P. Henry
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: the dark side is stronger, plus anakin had personal issues, which yoda warned about...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Order 66 has an extra provision. They must gain terrible aim.
<RosePetal1> OH MY GOD THEY KILLED HENRY!
<Lil_B> not the wubwubwub lizard :(
<Obsidian> RIP big forehead guy
<lollerguy> FEET
<RosePetal1> NO! Don't kill Mundi!
<Dark92Enigma> YOU BASTARDS
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Waaaaaulp? :'(
<CrazyHippie1234> NO!!!!11!!!
*Tovler picks coneheads for B movie in his honor
<JESmith71> And in a fan film my friend playing a Jedi dies as well
<Pinkies4thWall> NOT RAYLA!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Not Aayla Secura!!! :O
<lollerguy> D:
<RosePetal1> NO RAYLA!
<Spectrum_Rush> not ayala:(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14iirc, there was at least ONE squadron that didn't enact Order 66
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Isnt this a level in Unleashed?
<CrazyHippie1234> WHY DIDNT SHE SENSE THAT!
<RosePetal1> NO!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> NOOOOOO
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> damnit
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Now you're just messing with me. The dark side is NOT stronger. That is a defining principle of the ENTIRE Star Wars series.
<Meanwhile> Overkill much.
<ponibas> not the twi'lek!
<Darf14> wow, a Jedi caught off guard
<HellsFortune> MY YODA
<RosePetal1> Oh no Yoda.
<RustyMeat> poor yoda :(

<SpadeMagnes[R]> USE A SOMER SAULT
<Darf14> poor Yoda
<PinkiePieYoshi64> NOO!!! Not Kit Fisto!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: its not more Powerful, but it does have a stronger influence on the psyche, which was mentioned a lot
<PinkiePieYoshi64> waii...

<RosePetal1> NO NOT KIT!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> xD

<Obsidian> Not Master PLo
<RosePetal1> I MEAN NO NOT PLO!

<CrazyHippie1234> Like a BAUS
<Sumica> 00,10only good thing that came from the prequals was the animated
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> denied
<Ryunosuke> they ded
<Dark92Enigma> JAR JAR, YOU PROVOKED THIS!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why the hell would they program a kill all jedi order into the army that worked with the jedi?
<Darf14> KO!
<CriticKitten> Dude, you're gonna kill Yoda with TWO GUYS?
<lollerguy> CHEWY
<PinkiePieYoshi64> YODA SAID NO!
<CrazyHippie1234> Error 37
<Shamroc> wookies all like WTF!
<CriticKitten> Go get your army, you morons/.
<Pinkies4thWall> This is why we DONT FUCK WITH THE GREEN GUY
<RosePetal1> No!
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: i dont think dark or light influences. Its the way you use the force that determines if youre dark or light. The force isnt dark or light. its just the force
<Tovler> waiting to see how Ashoka will die is why I'm watching the cartoon.
<HellsFortune> YOUNGLINGS T.T
<RosePetal1> Oh no! :(
<Ryunosuke> oh noes!
<appleclouds> not the kids
<Squallken> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

<PinkiePieYoshi64> Not the kids!!!
<CrazyHippie1234> FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!
<Vivix> oh fucking jees horrible actor
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ---Karma Lost---
<TrixieMuffin> SpadeMagnes[R]: The army is for the republic , not for the jedi
<GabeMoist> SpadeMagnes[R], because Palpatine is against the jedi
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> FU
<CriticKitten> ....welp
<lollerguy> KILL THE COCKNEY KID FIRST
<RosePetal1> Have mercy!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> YOU MONSTER
<Tovler> poor Yeunglings
<Dark92Enigma> YOU KNOW, FOR KIDS
<Marx> ...
<Vivix> that was the worst childactor I've seen in a while
<JESmith71> Now to go to my happy place
<appleclouds> hes going to hell
<RosePetal1> Dam it Anakin.
<Sumica> 00,10so many darkside points were gained that night
<RaveBrony> You Bastard! :[ not the kids :'(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wait fall out kids cant die
<lollerguy> crie
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: yoda said that the dark side corrupts, and once you step down that path you cant go back, whereas if you step down the light side you can easily turn to dark
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :'( :'( :'( :'( :'( Not the happy children... :'( :'( :'(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So karma is invalad
<Lil_B> Anekin will get beaten by the kids
<ponibas> Yeungling?!?! oO
<lollerguy> LESS CRY MORE ACTION PLS
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Anakin's going to cut down Sunflowers
<JESmith71> And pretend I'm hacking sunflowers
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He wanted to get the bad ending.
<XylemTube> Aniken confirmed for psycho
<HellsFortune> Sumica: lol XD
<Sumica> 00,10he went from light side 2 to darside 4 in one day
<Marx> Not to mention all the Loyalty points that were lost.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ninja'd JESmith71 :3
<Obsidian> SaxyPretender: I remember that one
<lollerguy> yay
<RosePetal1> It's a trap!
<appleclouds> hes lucky hes not a jedi
<twilight_sprinkle> what was that sound
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S A TRAP
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Except that Episode 6 clearly defies that, Vader becomes good again.
<CrazyHippie1234> That kid was a lvl 76 padawan
<Midnight_Fyre> So did Yoda have a stroke between this movie and A New Hope? He seems in pretty good shape for being over 800 years old here, but looks pretty decrepit just a few decades later
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat young jedi
<Sumica> 00,10we got a bad ass
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Go kid
<RosePetal1> GO Kid we don't know!
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: he was the first exception of the wntire history
<SpadeMagnes[R]> DAMN
<PinkiePieYoshi64> NOOO
<RosePetal1> ded.
<lollerguy> ded
<HellsFortune> the kid was epic
<cratorkid> kid was better then most
<RaveBrony> ^
<CrazyHippie1234> F YAH!
<Obsidian> RIP epic kid
<Dark92Enigma> BRB.......dinner break
<SpadeMagnes[R]> At least the kid fought back
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Technically no he's not. >_>
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: clearly that kid plays vidya gaems
<Lil_B> who was this?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: he is. nobody else ever did that
<RosePetal1> Obi wan held his breath the longest time.
<TrixieMuffin> and he went passt all the other guys on that walkway without them noticing ???
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Pssst. KOTOR.
<CrazyHippie1234> Da wookies :'(
<Shooeie> Not the Cookies
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Skin the wookies for leatherworking
<RosePetal1> No, not the wookies :(
<Meanwhile> Croikey mate the wookies're dead.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat AT-RTs :O
<Darf14> poor Wookies :(
<JESmith71> The adult in that scene? I think that's Leia's adoptive dad or something
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Too bad Vader never learns force lightning.
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: its because its easy to become dark. its easy to hate to emprace rage and stuff. On the other hand its very hard to be a jedi.
<Sumica> 00,10I think the twi'lic that got it in the back was the one from the animated
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Chewie! :d
<RaveBrony> Chabuka
<Spectrum_Rush> ya know i just noticed all the troopers fire from the hip... they never aim down sight
<RaveBrony> :D
<CrazyHippie1234> Chewbroccoli
<RosePetal1> Now Chewbacca and that other wookie are the only ones left.
<JESmith71> Or is that Antillees? I can't remember
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: the games dont count, theyve ruined everythign with them. in TFU the main hero pulled down a goddamn star destroyer with the force
<Darf14> yay Chewie :)
<Pudge> Lets all be chewie for a day
<Kandarihu> So, Yoda's going to Dagobah?
<Midnight_Fyre> And George Lucas really thinks this is appealing to the fans :|
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Now flee... TO DAGOBAH!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: The entire canon plot of KOTOR (which is in canon with the Star Wars universe, so yes it DOES count) revolves around a redeemed Jedi.
<RosePetal1> We will see you soon Chewbacca.
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: yep
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> Not yet
<Vivix> WHITE
<Dark_Horst> oh?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat Tantive IV :O
<RosePetal1> Good memories.
<JESmith71> Not yet Kandarihu
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well the star destroyer was allready in decaying orbit he just speed up the process
<Tovler> living treehouses… So the holiday special is canon?
<Darf14> needs more white
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: yoda also said that the dark side overpowers the mind
<Dark_Horst> i missed that on my first sitting then
<RosePetal1> No, it's never cannon.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lol hes right there
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Luke also achieves this in the books, as do several others.
<Vivix> one n
<Kandarihu> Midnight_Fyre, you know what fans of anything love like crazy? CANON! We're crazy for it.
<Vivix> cannon is a thing canon is a concept
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: So no, it's not that unusual at all. >_>
<RosePetal1> GO!
<HellsFortune> i love the clone's ships though
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: It's difficult but not impossible.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> oooh, a CIS Strike Bomber.... (Star Wars Battlefront Terms :P )
<Tovler> taking off and landing
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: like i said, i dont count that because its ridiculous. and yes its extremely unusual, even if separate people did it. yoda said it many times, the dark side corrupts and overpowers the mind
<RosePetal1> We should play Star Wars Battlefront.
<BronyInstrumental> well, nearly 4AM. time for me to bed, methinks!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Damn it Obi Wan get better Wi Fi
<RosePetal1> nearly 11 o clock for me.
<HellsFortune> 6 am
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: You may not count it, but your opinion is irrelevant. The books and games are considered canon.
<Lil_B> good night BronyInstrumental
<HellsFortune> :>
<Vivix> 5 am here..terirble
<appleclouds> me too
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: because those feelings are so strong. and once you started hating its kind of a self runner. I still think its more a thing of mind and feelings than something that corrupts
<Dark_Horst> i think i still have battlefront lying around here somewhere
<shadowstep> man how did the clones aim get so bad when it switched to empire...
<HellsFortune> 6 am ftw
<Darf14> man, even in the future Wi Fi is still choppy at long range
<RosePetal1> Hi honey. I have just killed innocents to spread peace.
<Lil_B> HellsFortune where do you live?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: throughought the games and books the force has turned into magic, they tjrow fireballs, pull down star destroyers with the force, its ridiculous
<Vordox> HYPOCRITE EMO ARSEHOLD KID
<BronyInstrumental> night, Lil_B
<HellsFortune> Lil_B: israel :)
<Tovler> u liiiiiee
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Yeah, there's an attack on the Jedi Temple.... by ME :D
<XylemTube> Fuck you ani
<XylemTube> fuck you
<RosePetal1> Continue being evil MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
<Obsidian> R2 D2 "Get me the Fuck away from this lunatic!"
<RaveBrony> =_(\
<Lil_B> HellsFortune wow, I didn't know Israel was in the same Timezone as germany :)
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Doesn't really matter. It's canon.
<RosePetal1> Don't listen to him!
<Lil_B> ohai Vordox
<StinkomanFan> How long is left in this movie?
<HellsFortune> Lil_B: well we are gmt +2
<Sumica> 00,10doushbag hair
<lollerguy> NO.
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: but the dark side makes people crazy, otherwise they could make compromises, they never do
<dalekahn> Hai Vordox
<PinkiePieYoshi64> about 40 mins...
<RosePetal1> A few more hours.
<RosePetal1> NO!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Also pretty sure Force Unleashed's franchise plotline is sorta in that vein too.
<ponibas> Seps?
<Ryunosuke> oh yea, different
<ponibas> Ord Mantell?
<Obsidian> yes "different"
<JESmith71> We still have the Yoda vs. Palaptine, then Obi Wan vs. Anakin
<Shooeie> How many months is Padmane?
<HellsFortune> 600
<RosePetal1> 9 months.
<Lil_B> HellsFortune sry, I was thinking 1 hour aha, its only almost 5 am here, but the movie will end 6am for me XD, sry
<Kandarihu> HellsFortune, it's about time we start seeing some Israeli bronies here.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: even if you refer to something that was made after the movies.... its still very exception for someone to turn from the dark side
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: but dont forget that the extended univers is lower tier canon. Than the movies or the clonewars. so i would be cutious with that canon
<SpadeMagnes[R]> If I recall Force Unleashed happens after this movie and before Episode 4
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: It's rare, but not impossible.
<RaveBrony> Bufferrr
<HellsFortune> Lil_B: no worries :P due to online gaming i pretty much knows every time zones in EU
<HellsFortune> Kandarihu: heh thx :P
<Kandarihu> HellsFortune, /)
<RosePetal1> Just Yoda Anakin and you.
<Dark_Horst> corellian frigate, no?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its a trap
<StinkomanFan> OH LOOK, THE SET FROM THE FIRST MOVIE
<Tovler> It so white, just like in Episode 4 opening
<HellsFortune> tarp it is
<RosePetal1> No, we cannot go back. We have to hide.
<RosePetal1> That's because it's the same set.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Solar?
<CriticKitten> Fou_Lou: The classifications only matter as far as certain materials are concerned. The books are direct canon for all functional purposes. Worth noting that Lucas did kind of write these movies around said books.
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: yeah but people turning from light to dark as way more common, hence the light side doesnt influence the mind as much
<Tovler> Agree I, you mean
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> lava Planet
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Mustafar :D
<RosePetal1> Fire PLANET!
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: i doubt that. Hate and fear does. And that are the main feelings of the dark side.
<HellsFortune> FLIPPY FLIPPY LAVA LAVA
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I wanna live on Mustafar... O.O
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ok great its the lava level from Sonic 06
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGMA!
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: oh i see.
<Darf14> This must be Satand Summer Home
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> "Magma"
<Darf14> *Satans*
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Magmar?
<CriticKitten> Fou_Lou: The classifications really only exist so that they can make up shitty non-canon stories whenever they want and say "it doesn't count"
<Lil_B> Bucket of Lava-> only in Minecraft
<Obsidian> That's not suggestive at all
<Shooeie> "Take Care"
<Shamroc> DAT DOUBLE MEANING
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: yeah but once youve allowed those feelings, you dont fight the dark side as much, so it can twist your mind
<RosePetal1> Anakins going to come here and start killing you. Have a nice day.
<Sumica> 00,10and 20 years later they still use that same ship
<Pinkies4thWall> dumb Nemoidians
<JESmith71> SpadeMagnes yeah it's as long and boring
<CriticKitten> Fou_Lou: 'tis part of the reason I stop being a fan of the Star Wars franchise.
<Tovler> This used to be a peaceful planet. Then the fire everything attacked.
<RosePetal1> Hello weird alien.
<Thrackerzod> hey everyone
<Lil_B> Sumica it's so compfy -.-

<Lil_B> the floor is lava now
<RosePetal1> Watch out R2.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat R2 ejection seat...
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[R]: I hate sonic
<cow334> hai Lil_B how are you
<appleclouds> fire kindom
<TrixieMuffin> WHY ? because normally the temple is guarded by members of congress ? huh yoda ?
<RosePetal1> Stay there R2.
<Tovler> Mario galaxy had 2 fire planets. Take THAT, star wars.
<Lil_B> cow334 tired, 5am 1hour of movie left :/
<Midnight_Splendor> That looks safe constructing buildings on a geological unstable moon.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> stay R2 I've got some slaughtering to do
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So is this Solar or something?
<cow334> wait is this part 3?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Yes, but he only keeps the Senate at this stage to give the illusion of democracy.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Or are we in Norfair?
<RosePetal1> Hello Time to Die!
<HellsFortune> Lil_B: cmon, u can do it :P if i can u can :P
<Fou_Lou> twilight_sprinkle: no once you allowed those feelings you dont fight those feelings as hard as before. Its the same with everything once you have done something the first time the second time is easier
<cow334> Lil_B: lawl well it is good do right
<LadyCanary> OHHHH SHIT
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Hiya! Name's Pinkie Vader :D
<XylemTube> if only darth mual was still alive :(

<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat Saber throw :O
<Ryunosuke> yoda and obi-wan kicking ass
<Pinkies4thWall> SSABER THROW FTW
<RosePetal1> I know.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Also he flubbed the line anyways, there aren't thousands of star systems as we established last night. :P
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Sumica: Coruscant? I agree!
<RaveBrony> I loved Battlefront 2 :3
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: obiwans phrase was correct for the current moment
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, it's pretty much how any responsible government turns into a dictatorship. Too much power concentrated in too few people is guaranteed to be abused.
<pony_8375> they are called "master" for a reason
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: mustafar or the temple?
<Sumica> 00,10no, ordmantel
<Shamroc> and suddenly storm troopers suck
<RosePetal1> Dam it! Jar Jars still Alive!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> foiled
<Sabershy> Sumica: Yea. The Jedi Council map is mostly centered in the mddle
<Sumica> 00,10or what ever the lava one is
<Lil_B> HellsFortune I'll do, I made it too 5:30 this and last week :P (but I need somw water brb)
<Shooeie> How is Jar Jar still alive?
<Alister> Yes believe the guy who looks like a sorcerer
<Ryunosuke> mustafar?
<RosePetal1> He's not a Jedi.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :'(
<Thrackerzod> ded
<CriticKitten> Oh look, some dead kids
<HellsFortune> kids :(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> CAST LIFE
<Midnight_Fyre> Seriously, nobody consider it odd that Yoda kicks ass in this movie despite being about 880 years old, but another 20 years leaves him barely able to walk?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: there are billions of systems actually according to wiki
<lollerguy> FUCK THE YOUNGLINGS
<RosePetal1> It's Children Obi Wan.
<lollerguy> LEL
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Use a pheonix down damn it!
<Kandarihu> Shooeie, he's not a Jedi
<JESmith71> "Yay" It's a bunch of dead people
<lollerguy> FUK DA POLESE
<CriticKitten> Uh, Yoda?
<Sumica> 00,10perhaps he just triped yoda
<RosePetal1> Poor children.
<CriticKitten> They have no markings on them at all actually
<CriticKitten> So I think they're just napping
<PinkiePieYoshi64> *cue epic music*
<RosePetal1> They did not want parents to be offended.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> and back to the meeting
<durger> is Yuengling's a good beer? I've never had it before
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: seems legit
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> deformed
<appleclouds> he has no mercy
<RosePetal1> Make up your mind!
<cow334> danm annaken went to the dark side
<Sabershy> Midnight_Fyre: The battle with Palpatine screwed his body up. Plus 20 years of solitude can make you weaker.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> ALL HAIL THE EMPEROR!
<lollerguy> noooouu
<cow334> wyyyy
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> All Hail Lelouch
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: We established last night, otakon confirmed. There are a few hundred, 400 or so IIRC. :p
<RosePetal1> Dem eyes.
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> no wait wrong
<Midnight_Fyre> Sabershy: Maybe . . .
<twilight_sprinkle> Fou_Lou: he pretty much gives up on fighting the dark side, lets the influence in, and then its much harder to overcome
<Tovler> If found Yuengling to be too strong. I'm not much of a beer guy.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> does eyes
<Sumica> 00,10see that face that is atleast darkside 2
<Pinkies4thWall> lol RivaLz|AFK|Draw
<HellsFortune> THE FIRST GALACTIC EMPIRE ! :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why is anyone buying this bullshit?
<otakon> EMPIYAH!
<durger> ah thanks
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeMagnes[R]: hes using mind influence

<Alister> ''Meaning you will have no political power'' APPLAUDES
<Spectrum_Rush> got to admit it gives me chills
<Vivix> even without mindinfluence this is possible
<RosePetal1> That MAKES NO SENSE.
<owloysius> yay
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ---Karma Lost---
<CriticKitten> I know you're trying to be profound, Padme, but you're not.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Peace in death
<Sumica> 00,10oi aliens are not aloud to whilhem

<cow334> NOOO
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Now LOOT EVERY CORPSE
<Kandarihu> She took the words right out from my fingers.
<RosePetal1> Makes no sense.
<Tovler> I'm buying his bullshit. He promised peace.
<cratorkid> where are ninjas
<Dark_Horst> there wasnt any wilhelm here
<RaveBrony> D:
<Darf14> now Jedi are a endangered species
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Loot all the Lightsabers!

<Dark_Horst> there was?
<XylemTube> oh no
<RosePetal1> No, this cannot be!
<CriticKitten> Darf14: Not as endangered as they make it seem. The books pull Jedi out of their asses. :P
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> it can, and it is
<Dark_Horst> weird. i never miss a wilhelm
<RustyMeat> NO ITS NOT TRUE
<Tovler> Obiwan seems heartbroken.
<RustyMeat> ITS NOT POSSIBLE
<RosePetal1> That
<cow334> obiwan
<Darf14> lol so true CriticKitten
<twilight_sprinkle> that last recording is odd, whered they get that footage
<RosePetal1> IMPOSSIBLE!
<cow334> dosent approvve
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Did they find the plot telly?
<RosePetal1> Secret camera.
<CriticKitten> Speak English, Yoda.
<Spectrum_Rush> twilight_sprinkle: emperor came to the temple
<Shooeie> Obi has to fight his inner deamons
<CriticKitten> You don't need to twist every sentence.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> consumed by Darth Vader
<RosePetal1> He has to kill Anakin.
<RaveBrony> Ilvl is not high enough D:
<Lil_B> this is such a rippof of Hitler... start trouble, show people that you "know how to fix everything", get the politicians into endless voting until you get everything
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Use the power of friendship Obi Wan!
<RosePetal1> So Anakin is ded.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that was the point iirc, Lil_B
<Dark92Enigma> CONSUMCEPTION?
<twilight_sprinkle> Spectrum_Rush: it was also a good cinematic view :D
<Sumica> 00,10use fealings? nah just ask his wife
<TrixieMuffin> Jedi propaganda
<RaveBrony> :D
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> Anakin Skywalker is no more...theres only Vader
<RosePetal1> Last night.
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: well, history has proven that it's a reliable system
<CriticKitten> Lil_B: It's meant to be political commentary on Bush actually. :p
<Shooeie> Dose bad lies
<RustyMeat> dat belly
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Obi Wan needs the magic of friendship
<XylemTube> aniken's always been ded. he's no different than he was in EP2
<Lil_B> SaxyPretender I know, George lucas even said it himself
<RosePetal1> Well at least he won't whine,.
<cow334> isnt that anykens wife
<CriticKitten> Lil_B: Which is partially why it fails so hard.
<cow334> he said batman
<cow334> i swear
<RosePetal1> I'm Obi Wan!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> listen to him woman
<RaveBrony> WRONG

<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: why do people say everypony? everybody works too
<cow334> Lawl
<Shooeie> yay
<CriticKitten> My god, Anakin, you've slaughtered the Youngling Race!
<RosePetal1> Younglings are children who are just learing the force. But really they should call them children.

<XylemTube> we coulda had a good old fashioned Jedi fist fight :(
<PinkiePieYoshi64> How DA BUCK did they get in that rom!?!?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: it seems they were more concerned in showing off the environment in this. too much cgi
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> Boss fight!
<RosePetal1> Imagine if there's a audience.
<cow334> hater is losing bye yoda

<RosePetal1> Our powers are too equal.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: but they drag it out for SO LONG
<CriticKitten> It inherently bothers me that Yoda gets beat and then just runs away like a pussy. That BITES.
<VenHur96> The ONLY thing that keeps me awaken is the climax battles.

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Whoops
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> there goes the shields!

<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> haha xD
<CriticKitten> otakon: And yet is more powerful than Windu, who beat Palpatine's ass.
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: i pretty much doubt windu > palpatine
<Dark92Enigma> LIKE A BOSS
<cow334> hai PinkiePieYoshi64 how are you
<RosePetal1> NO!
<otakon> and yet Palpatine was throwing tons of them

<GabeMoist> CriticKitten, It's debatable that Windu could actually beat palpatine
<cow334> PinkiePieYoshi64: i am doing exelent thanks for asking
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: oh joy, i get to explain more obvious things to the critic. have you ever considered that palpatine let windu beat him
<otakon> and that is what happened to Yoda
<Midnight_Fyre> thump
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wait he lost on purpous?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :D
<HowToFryChicken> laugh

<HellsFortune> HowToFryChicken: i agree
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> robot
<Lil_B> You fight like a Dairy Farmer!
<RosePetal1> How long is this fight?!
<Fou_Lou> CriticKitten: i doubt that. Because palpatine plottet it that way. He felt anakin coming and deciced to get in this situation to manipulate anakin
<Kandarihu> Is this Geonosis again?
<StinkomanFan> In the Lego games you had to work together while still fighting to the death
<HowToFryChicken> WHO CARES ABOUT THE WHINY BITCH I WANT OLD PEOPLE KICKING ASS
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: thats personal and irrelevant, dont avoid the subject.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The place is gonna blow up.... shouldent they be getting out of here?
<RosePetal1> No Mustafar.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> that shot!
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: Let's get this straight, then....Palpatine's genius plan was to lose a fight to Windu and HOPE that Anakin shows up to bail him out.
<RosePetal1> Epic shot.
<HowToFryChicken> ratyoda
<Ryunosuke> lol yoda
<HowToFryChicken> Double your search!
<Tovler> Moostafar. Where is SuperBrony64|AFK?
<RosePetal1> Yoda is faking his own death.
<Darf14> Yoda is in you harddrive stealing your RAM
<Dark92Enigma> Come on! I wanted Palpatine vs Yoda to drag a little longer
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I'm sorry, that's a really stupid plan if so.
<VenHur96> Dude, the fight is long because obviously the audience was asleep for like...I don't know, the first half or something?
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: he couldve felt him and let the battle drag on as much as he needed
<Dark_Horst> who the HELL is that guy?
<RosePetal1> So in reality Yoda won.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> THE SEARCH HAS BEEN DOUBLED
<owloysius> huzzah

<CrimsonPhoenix> SaxyPretender, but you're a mod
*LadyCanary giggles
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And Obi Wan proceeds to ninja all the loot

<CriticKitten> Fou_Lou: Instead he wasted three nameless Jedi, nearly dies to Windu, and then I've just gotta accept that Yoda runs from him like a pansy bitch? Ugh. I hate it.
<otakon> Like I said the only thing that kept him alive was his hate.
<appleclouds> :( yay
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Expansion sequel!

<RainBowJack> those Storm troopers you dont see them any more
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> jesus touch

<lollerguy> HUGE SUCCESS
<Sumica> 00,10and then he sat there and poke at his woulds for 20 min it took them to come back

<RosePetal1> The moon.
<otakon> CriticKitten: not by lava, proximity to lava
<Spitfire> incoming meme
<HowToFryChicken> T3 only because arnold gets his face slammed into a bathroom stall.

<PinkiePieYoshi64> Chorus: AAAAAHHHHHHHHAAAAAHHHHUUUUUHHHHHAAHHHUUHHHHHAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
<VenHur96> Bye StinkomanFan
<CriticKitten> Saxy: Like I just said, if you take off the Star Wars label, they're average. Mediocre.
<Shooeie> Night
<cow334> bye StinkomanFan
<durger> Pudge, yeah, they're making three films out of The Hobbit
<HowToFryChicken> VenHur96: You just contradicted yourself.
<cachi01> VenHur96: this were the prquels xd
<Ponies47> Bye StinkomanFan
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: everyone loved cliche ripoffs like despicable me or that zombie movie too.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: No, they're about par with a typical action movie.
<HowToFryChicken> See ya bronies that are leaving
<Yahooz> If you listen closely to that singing, you can hear the butthurt of die hard starwars fans
<Jmo4267> dat text flow.
<Pudge> durger: dear god, I sense a lot of fliller
<Tovler> I give all of these movies a 3/10. Every month I have a new least favorite prequel.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD Yahooz
<Pudge> filler*
<HowToFryChicken> Eh.
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: And they certainly don't compete with the Nolan Batmans, so I'll assume that line was just to troll. :p
<HowToFryChicken> Still a better trilogy then toy story
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Wait... australian construction crew?
<Shooeie> Have we watched the Aliens Trilogy?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> the hell?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Yep, Shooeie
<HowToFryChicken> idk
<cachi01> Shooeie: Eeyup
<Ponies47> Come on guys! REVENGE OF THE SITH WASEN'T THAT BAD! :(
<HowToFryChicken> You guise watched everything :(
<Shooeie> Im running out of movies
<HowToFryChicken> It wasn't.
<Pudge> ep 3 is the best of the prequels
<Tovler> Better than the Godfather Trilogy. So boooring
<cachi01> ^^
<HowToFryChicken> what Pudge said
<Sumica> 00,10they were good movie but they were meh starwars
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: yeah, and whats so good about batman? the hero wasnt designed by Nolan, the action was ordinary, the plot twists were obvious
<Sabershy> I liked it because I don't dwell on it.
<CriticKitten> Ponies47: It's my favorite of the prequels, actually. It's still a weak film overall though.
<Yahooz> Still better than Twilight imo :p
<cow334> Tis movie ONE MILION MONEY
*Ponies47 agrees with Pudge
<appleclouds> :'(
<Dark92Enigma> I give these movies 4.5/10 Overall dissapointing, the III was better than the rest (of the prequels)............
<HowToFryChicken> Episode 2 was complete crap, except when yoda came in to fight dooku
<Darf14> Still a better story than Twilight
<appleclouds> :'(
<Shooeie> Have we watched the Mummy Trilogy?
<appleclouds> minbnmp
<HowToFryChicken> Episode 1, same shit, except Maul saved teh film.
*RaveBrony cant keep up with the chat :D
<Yahooz> YEAH LETS ALL RATE DA MOVEH
<Ponies47> CriticKitten: It's may fav of the prequels
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
<Yahooz> :p
<Thrackerzod> appleclouds ? why sad?
<AnakinSkywalker> What if....We shopped raptors into every frame in Twilight?
<HowToFryChicken> STAR WARS THEME QUEUE
<VenHur96> You see folks, whenever you tried to make a 3 movie in a trillogy, like Spiderman 3 or Shrek the Third, or tryed to make a newer trillogy to an already existing one, it's just not right.
<Pudge> my speakers being plugged into my computer is STILL a better love story than twilight
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: I don't respond to obvious trolling. You really just don't want to accept that these movies were panned with good reason and you're throwing jabs at everything else you can find.
<Tovler> Is there a chick flick trilogy somewhere?
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> Instant NOOO Button hahahaha
<RainBowJack> did I see the name : PETER JAKSON come by?
<Shooeie> Is it a no to the Mummy trilogy?
<VenHur96> But then there's Toy Story 3...
<cachi01> skywlker sound
<Darf14> I am saving that no button
<HowToFryChicken> How about the Bourne Trilogy?
<Pudge> Shooeie: please no
<SaxyPretender> 0,14saw that too, HowToFryChicken
<HowToFryChicken> I can't frickin believe they're making a fourth one.
<cachi01> TOY STORY TRILOGY
<Wrek|Observiking> 05ep 2 and 3 could jsut aswell have been 1 entire movie. but they had to make 2 and add alot of useless filler inbetween. now lets watch LOTR again
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Finaly!
<HowToFryChicken> daw
<Pudge> HowToFryChicken: they did that
<Yahooz> cachi01: already done
<Sabershy> Ilike Wrek's idea.
<Dark92Enigma> They were filled with overreacting drama, soap oper-ish subplots........little to no action until the END........AFTER HOURS OF FILLER
<RivaLz|AFK|Draw> YES LOTR!!!!!!!!
<CriticKitten> I like that idea.
<Sumica> 00,10that comes later this month wrek
<CrimsonPhoenix> HowToFryChicken, nothing is comfirmed
<Sabershy> I haven't watch LotR yet.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> LOTR :D :D :D

<Pinkies4thWall> MAH BOI

<CrimsonPhoenix> but larger
<CrimsonPhoenix> and unportable

<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[R]: POKEMAN LOL
<SpadeMagnes[R]> My grandpa calls the Wii the W I2
<Dken2021> everyone called it pokeman
<potato_pony> why is he being interviewed?
<Lunac> Pokemon = Poke a man typical japaese fad
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'll give my grandpa a break given he's about 80...
<Dj_Cyber-4G> what does I.E. mean
<superretroworld> Lunac: omg if a brony goes on there, i hope he gives jerry a black eye, proving bronies are 20% cooler and stronger
<Lunar_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix what interview? I didn't hear it.
<Lunac> Internet Explorer

<Lunar_Brony> Lunac slow
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I hope the Wii U gets a metroid game

<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah
<SpadeMagnes[R]> My grandpa

<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld I don't knwo him.
<Dken2021> plus it's lat
<Dken2021> late
<SpadeMagnes[R]> 's wlal mart has shitty security
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The cameras mostly dont work
<Pinkies4thWall> A sniggle is a combination of a giggle and a snort, as seen in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymKvFYG7mGM
<superretroworld> Lunar_Brony: hes a talk show host on tbs, hes pretty famous
<Wrek|Observiking> 05how so lunac?
<Dken2021> though jerry springer wasn't relevant these days
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld I know who he is.
<OtakuTom> Lunac, have you seen or heard anything he's done since the TV show ended?
<Dken2021> *thought

<SpadeMagnes[R]> I always peel those off
<Lunac> Jerry springer isn't likely to be fair WrekObserviking
<CrimsonPhoenix> why isn't this with the original song
<CrimsonPhoenix> why is it always the cut version
<Pinkies4thWall> MahBoi777: leave it on all night
<Lunar_Brony> Lunac I'm intriegued, although I have no idea what to expect. I've never seen one of his shows.
<spartan133t> cachi01: THE STREAM HAS STARTED!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Godda...... i was free of that song for at least a week or more ....

<Xaiden> meaeah
<cachi01> SpadeMagnes[R]: didnt knew
<lowfn> twilight_sprinkle: Glad I'm not the only one...
<Lunac> Over here we banned the Jerry Springer musical for a reason, good taste and manners
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[R] yea, the batteries in them only last a couple of years
<OtakuTom> The TV show was crap. If you get a chance, listen to him on the radio. He's good on the radio.
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[R], only the ability for the cartridges to hold a save.
<CrimsonPhoenix> SpadeMagnes[R], there's a memory chip inside that runs out after a while
<Ryunosuke> that cook
<CrimsonPhoenix> or batteries...
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld I don't remember what I said. I knew nothing about him before today except he hosts a talk show.
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[R] but you can replace them
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I still own a gameboy copy of Gold and Silver
<twilight_sprinkle> lowfn: yeah, im glad im not the only one as well

<lowfn> Lunar_Brony: I dont.
<Lunac> Good to hear kirstryfe
<derpy_pony> we would welcome texas in the EU. decent human capital, decent industry, ideal bridgehead into the US markets and cuba
<kirzstryfe> Lunar_Brony, if it helps, most of the people I do make fun of are from my own country
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> just leaving the colors right kirzstryfe ?
<Lunar_Brony> lowfn that was a bit stereotypical, but I have been down-right insulted on numerous occasions by Americans.
