<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nope Baman
<FlareChaser> Rave|Happy: Don't worry...be happy.... why are you happy?
<CK|Ded> Nittany: Apparently Blizzard's fans do not. I've been arguing with several people who seem convinced that Diablo 2's offline single player was also on Battle.net, and it was also totally hackable.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Indeed
<Biglaw> It was Batpan!
<legacyofvrak> NO SHIT
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I had it from a very young age fortunately. I remember dial-up and everything. :D

<TheRainbowDash> This is actually a pretty cool show, too bad they canceled it in my area after only a few episodes. (In my area, the channel was removed):(
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> omg its star wars
<flutter_spin> this show is so entertaining
<Midnight_Tempest> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: you tab fail so hard...
<flutterfriend> oh crappy animators lol
<Rave|Happy> Hey everypony!! :)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> They said the Companion Cube couldn't attack me :(

<MrPoniator> What show's on?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O hai Rave|Happy
<Uakh> WE NEED A HEALER

<Cobellanez> Hey Rave|Happy
<flutter_spin> "Code Lyoko"
*PinkiePieFTW likes to be smacked
*Midnight_Tempest explodes
<Airpuff> So heroic.
<CK|Ded> Sumica: I suppose one could "hack" a person's Diablo 2 offline files by hacking their computer and manually stealing the files. I suppose that pigs jumping out of a window are also technically flying for a short span of time.
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane contains Midnight_Tempest s explosion
<PinkiePieFTW> the trifecta!
<EonMastor> how do you lose life points when you block every attack?
*flutterfriend makes fun of the crappy animation
*Dken2021 joins flutterfriend

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Cheap
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's a lot harder to hack SP accounts when they're offline.

<GilDash> Airpuff: I think the credits do make mention of Skywalker Sound, so...
<Jim> Bronysith: Nowai
<CK|Ded> Nittany: it's also pointless to do when hacking Battle.net is a thousand times easier.

<flutter_spin> ... trade places? Great idea!
<GarrettBrony> They need more railings
<Shizuka> 13xana's motivation this season is removing aelita so he has free rein, and our heroes for much the same reason
<GilDash> Airpuff: You look squeaky clean...
<Bronysith> TAAAAAAAAAAANK
<Uakh> need a dispenser here
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The mission is to explode.
<Shizuka> 13but, this plan is still dumb

<PinkiePieFTW> they will rematerialize her.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Here we go.
<GilDash> Bronysith: That's what I keep asking.
<PinkiePieFTW> obviously
<PinkiePieFTW> she falls in.
<Shizuka> 13Bronysith: i don't think they ever explain it, but it's a common pattern that once someone's booted out, they don't get to go back in
<legacyofvrak> CK|Ded: no.. he's not... (not in the real life)
<Shizuka> 13until the reset buttom
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He'll have to use that program.
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: I don't like Dash shipping, only the R34 stuff....:F
<Lambo> Yes, look at YOUR SHAPE! YOUR FOREHEAD IS HUUUUUUGE
<TheRainbowDash> :D
<Litwick> Falling damage in my platformer? Hell no.
<PinkiePieFTW> they use the one-time program to rematerialize her
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> cause if they had a day of no xana attack?
<Om> Even in that state he is better than Umi >.>
<CK|Ded> Dat ball monster

<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: Somehow....
<Shizuka> 13Bronysith: possibly, it's at least established that they do feel, ish, the pain of whatever killed them
<PartyCannon> these guys
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> they all wear the exact same clothes everyday
<TheRainbowDash> Lasers are very dangerous kids.
<cachi01> i think i managed to understand how to use that machine
<GarrettBrony> LAZAHS

<cachi01> u just need to shout what u want it to do
<cachi01> and press enter

*GilDash hops into Irish_Pony's barrel.
*Airpuff stares at GilDash "Do not question a god!" D=
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Dken2021: i think they get stuck in the lyoko world
<Lambo> Let's play some Banjoo kaazooie or watch some Ponies
<CK|Ded> I like how Jeremy's lips moved but he didn't say squat
<TheRainbowDash> Ryanier128: Oh, good to hear. I am doing good myself.
<cachi01> Lambo: DONT ASK FOR PONIES
<legacyofvrak> Back to the past? he say?
<Meanwhile> Having forgone shenanigans for some time, t'is about time for more.
<flutter_spin> yep ck
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> pfft Airpuff isnt a god
<PartyCannon> Recycle Bin/
<CK|Ded> Dat recycled footage
<DiscordsMaker> Lambo: PONIES
<PartyCannon> ?
<Sumica> 00,10good thing they have the one time use program
<GilDash> Airpuff: I don't seem to recall any reprecussions for doing so.
<Airpuff> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: im a god-god
<Ryanier128> what are we watching?
<FlaschenJoe11> GarrettBrony: Pretty fast if you think about the fact that there was no Internet back then
<DiscordsMaker> but not now interupting a show is rude
<PinkiePieFTW> he's really going to think about it.
<flutter_spin> .....so?
<CupcakeWarrior> She died, shouldnt she be sent back Sumi?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01knew this would happen
<PinkiePieFTW> what an ass.
<cachi01> CupcakeWarrior: she is still falling
<PartyCannon> WOAH
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<legacyofvrak> no
<OmegaMetroidBrony> wait what? return to the past didn't renew Yumi?
<Brony_Pony> LOL
<owlicious> You can only run a program once!

<Meanwhile> One and only one. WOAH
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is sad
*Irish_Pony noms on GilDash's mane
<CK|Ded> Why is this a decision?
<OmegaMetroidBrony> No copy paste?
<Sumica> 00,10they are outside time loops as they are at teh focal point
<CK|Ded> Yumi is dead, Aelita isn't
<flutter_spin> its the use once time scroll :P
<PinkiePieFTW> ck|ded, that's what i'm saying!
<GilDash> Airpuff: Oh, I know you all too well. ;)
<Uakh> shit was fast
<Airpuff> :'(
<PinkiePieFTW> why did he even have to think?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> srsly Jeremie x Aelita
<Uakh> didn't use MySQL
<Lambo> So, they actually die every time they go into the machine?
*GarrettBrony does the Time Wrap (Again)
<Obsidian> Youll be okay... you only died
<flutter_spin> woot
<Sumica> 00,10Jearmy has so much blue balls
<Meanwhile> lol
<PinkiePieFTW> good news is, jeremie always has his right hand.
<CK|Ded> I'M EXPRESSING MY FEELINGS IN DIALOGUE.
<Lambo> The thing is with this kind of dematerializing is, that when you get out, you are not the same fucking person - you are just an exact copy!!!
*GilDash kisses Irish_Pony.
<Dken2021> lol PinkiePieFTW
<Lambo> So they actually die
<Bronysith> Obsidian: only minjor brain dmg and a partially thrown up heart but ur fine
<Uakh> now he can jerk off
<Kid_Cobalt> Sumica: lol
<PartyCannon> MANY EPISODES LATER
<Shizuka> 13presumably it has to do with the stored profiles of their real and virtual selves, you have to keep spiritual continuity
<CupcakeWarrior> At least she comes to the real world at the end of this season
<FlaschenJoe11> Lambo: so it's like beaming?
*DiscordsMaker walks over to GarrettBrony and says "slap my hand"!
<Airpuff> omg rape

<Uakh> here's your condom
<CK|Ded> Candy can fix anything.
<Lambo> FlaschenJoe11: Of course it is. Your atoms get ripped apart
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate these kind of stories.
<Kid_Cobalt> true.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Iknowwhat he should do. He should continually spill candy onto the key board until he gets it right
<flutter_spin> Can O.o dy
<Bronysith> Shizuka: i just dont get the show. still good
<Meanwhile> Now get in the van

*GarrettBrony slaps DiscordsMaker 's hand
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Suddenly credits
<DiscordsMaker> Now lets watch some pony
<GilDash> Wait, that ended? :D
<Shizuka> 13like i said, season 1 is weak compared to the rest, they were still finding their niche, establishing the mechanics and whatnot
<DiscordsMaker> or whatever
<legacyofvrak> Airpuff: soo right

<Canadian_Brony> Ryanier128 your username is the same one I use for basically everything
<FlareChaser> teh_Tharassan: who said that? there ar emore in the basement
<Yukari> if you happen to drink a lot of soda though, it stretches a bladder
<Yukari> not really ll
<Bronysith> SteveCharb: okay. its just a personal thing
<drfsupercenter> 03also ow, my fricking neck hurt
<drfsupercenter> 03s
<teh_Tharassan> cool...
<Meanwhile> For sages, they aren't particularly adept.

<Uakh> NOPE
<Irish_Pony> nope.avi
<SteveCharb> RAWRity: hmmm interesting
<Ryanier128> Canadian_Brony really? I just randomly made it up one day
<Yukari> not when sex and suggestive topics seem discussed quite often
<FlareChaser> Nikoooo my cousin!
<junh1024-XD> huehuehue
<legacyofvrak> Derpy_Hooves: Well... then I'm not gonna tell you the secret of the Soul Reaver

<FlareChaser> Bronysith: okay...
<SteveCharb> dat anti-fire racism
<Litwick> Chukata chukata chuk chuk chukuta
<RAWRity> YOu can actually see some of that when you watch Momo's actions. Often times he acts like a tacit mentor/source of comfort to Aang, especially in the first season.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> O_O
<drfsupercenter> 03OK anyway though
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> goddam it stream
<drfsupercenter> 03I guess what I don't get is like, I'm not drinking anything in my sleep (obviously) so why do I have to keep getting up to pee
<Yukari> anyways drf, tl;Dr soda has serious effects on bladder
<SteveCharb> RAWRity: hmmm do you think that's still a plausible theory?
<Yukari> just saying
<legacyofvrak> Sniper Elite v2 Demo... IS READY (Steam)
<Yukari> because
<Sumica> 00,10avatar roku was good at mine craft it seems
<RAWRity> SteveCharb: ultimately, no. But it's a neat thing to think about.

<junh1024-XD> its what you drink during the day
<Canadian_Brony> Ryanier128 huh, really? If that's so, then I would ask you not to use it anywhere else. I made it up about 8 years ago

<OmegaMetroidBrony> Can firebenders bend Magma and Lava?
*FlareChaser is bored

<Meanwhile> I think magma and lava is more earth than fire.
<Litwick> Bowser's getting very lazy in his design

<Meanwhile> RAWRity: I'm not.

<Yukari> summer, you should work on switching back daytime schedule lol
<PinkiePieFTW> he goes glow and wrecks his shit.
<Bronysith> PinkiePieFTW: spoilers
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Whoa OP
<Obsidian> My little avatar Comets are Magic
<Invi> Sumica there was never a movie of that show?
<FlaschenJoe11> There was, in the words of Sokka. "At least the effects were decent."
<DaringDude> Pinkie pies ish best theatre
<CK|Ded> Comets are made of ice and rock, silly Sumi. :p
<PinkiePieFTW> whoops sorry
<Freefall29> that comet is overpowered, the writers need to erf it
<Freefall29> nerf
<PinkiePieFTW> spoiler alert
<GarrettBrony> Here is a joke. What is M Night Shamalan's Favorite Dance move....... The Twist!
<DaringDude> PinkiePieFTW: i agree with ur name
<OmegaMetroidBrony> inb4 kick
<Sumica> 00,10how do you know they are the same in this universe?
<Bronysith> GarrettBrony: (facehoof)
<Canadian_Brony> well, THAT's helpful
<PinkiePieFTW> oh sokka
<Om> Prepare your everything.
<PinkiePieFTW> always worrying about your friends
<SteveCharb> hmmmm everything Roku just said is true
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: Technically it's not a comet. It's a class of space junk called an "Earth grazer" and those can be made of rock or other substances. But "Sozin's earth grazer" doesn't quite have the same majesty to it.
<Invi> Sumica they can meet each other
<Canadian_Brony> eeyup
<rdash> k, its now official... #bronystate moves way too fast to read on my screen...
<Bronysith> prepare yourself..... SUMMER IS COMING!!!!!!!
<CK|Ded> Sumi: That's excuse-making. :P
<FlaschenJoe11> M. Night Shamamalama-Sama...-Kun
<Sumica> 00,10indeed
<Nabronyan> WINTER WRAP UP
<Freefall29> RAWRity... stop applying logic, this is avatar damnit
<DaringDude> Saturn now im half way through AI wiki u got anything elsei can read?
<Sumica> 00,10but you are making asumptions too
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is summer
<Uakh> ÜBER CHARGE
<CK|Ded> "Assumptions" that are based on the norm, ergo they make more sense than "comet is made of fire because reasons"
*Nittany_Discord 11,01is ready
<Bronysith> SUMMER IS COMING!!!
<Litwick> AND HERE COMES BERSERKER MODE
<Sumica> 00,10lol he said fire.
<GarrettBrony> Sumica and well you asume you make an ass out of u and me
<Meanwhile> Hehe. Fire.
<SteveCharb> GarrettBrony: here's the twist ending, I WAS M NIGHT SHAYAMALAN THE WHOLE TIME
<PinkiePieFTW> sozin's earth-grazer pony is best pony
<Om> Nooooope
<Meanwhile> OH SHIT SON
<Canadian_Brony> holy shit . . .
<Invi> Sumica if you take it that exactly, everything is a asumption
<Ponies47> So poeple where asking me about if I was a brony today and stuff. I said eeyup they started to laugh. :( You know what I say? BUCK THEM! :[
<FlaschenJoe11> "GET OFF MY LAWN!!"
<Freefall29> what the buck
<GarrettBrony> SteveCharb: DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i want to firebend my tea
<twilight_sprinkler> how? who knows
<RAWRity> CK|Ded: technically it could just be the friction caused in the atmosphere by the comet.
<PinkiePieFTW> run zuko! that's all you're good for!
<Uakh> BADASS
<GilDash> Ponies47: Who cares if they laugh? You've got people like us backing you up. We're all you need.. :)
<SteveCharb> PinkiePieFTW: aw I like Zuko
<Om> The Avatar is the world mod
<Resonantwaves> herro
<Resonantwaves> :p
<PinkiePieFTW> me too.
<Freefall29> who would laugh at ponies47?
<Bronysith> SteveCharb: same. i love it when badguys become heroes
<PinkiePieFTW> i'm just that guy who makes fun of everything
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If lava is melted rock, it should be part of earth bending.
<PinkiePieFTW> it
<SteveCharb> heelface turn ftw
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> brb guys restarting computer
<PinkiePieFTW> it's fun. you should try it sometime
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: I think it kind of falls under both.
<Sumica> 00,10nice hat momo
<GarrettBrony> TV Tropes.
<Ponies47> GilDash: So true :) Haters gonna hate. But I'm gonna love and tolerate :P
<SteveCharb> Bronysith: Zuko's is so well done and gradual
<Bronysith> Ponies47: i made another chapter
<RAWRity> Plus, Roku IS the Avatar. He could have been earthbending.
<FlaschenJoe11> Momo Dash always dresses in style.
<GarrettBrony> Streamers gonna Stream
<GilDash> Ponies47: That's the way to go. :)
<SteveCharb> very believable
<DaringDude> yay for being in a program where ppl are mature and dont really care about my bronyism
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord and RAWRity the show describes Lava and Magma as Liquid Fire
<Uakh> destroying thousand years old sacred temple : check
<Bronysith> SteveCharb: eeeyup
<FlareChaser|Octavia> ....

<Ponies47> Freefall29: Classmates of my school
<FlareChaser|Octavia> I'm bored, so imma go start a new character in WoW.
<SteveCharb> PinkiePieFTW: ADMIRAL mutton chops
<CK|Ded> RAWRity: Fair enough, that doesn't make any more sense for buffing firebenders though. The moon trick for waterbending makes sense somewhat at least, the comet....not as much
<Invi> dat ending theme <3
<PinkiePieFTW> oh yeah.
<GarrettBrony> general side burns PinkiePieFTW
<PinkiePieFTW> he got promoted.
<Obsidian> Remember the Avatar can bend all elements so it doesnt matter wheter it falls under earth or fire

<flutterfriend> no
<Invi> Freefall29 but wheatly is the moron core
<PinkiePieFTW> are you nervous? because on the surface you look calm and ready.
<SteveCharb> like that one time Monster-Shy was stuck behind the two gabbing ponies with the garbage carts... it's like, just fly around them, fluttershy
<PinkiePieFTW> to drop bombs, that is.
<Giger4444> Im off to sleep. Bye all!
<RAWRity> it still kind of baffles me people say Luna is "Underrated".
<PinkiePieFTW> cya giger
*Nerom MineTurtle says Hello
<Obsidian> Bye Giger4444
<crazypony> bye ginger4444
<rdash_> Kabaka:
<SteveCharb> RAWRity: well, by the writers and animators she is
<Canadian_Brony> seeya Giger4444
<Freefall29> underrated doesn't mean a bad thing. its more of a compliment.
<Woodenfan> Hi everyone
<Invi> bya Giger4444
<Sumica> 00,10Dari's kick all realy brok my shit yesterday
<PinkiePieFTW> hi woodenfan
<RAWRity> Despite being a supporting character with minimum screen time, she is by far one of the most popular characters in the fandom.
<Invi> moin again Woodenfan
<Yukari> god these people are morons
<PinkiePieFTW> who, rawrity?
<flutterfriend> yeah
<Woodenfan> I got my streamer to work!
<Obsidian> Wb Woodenfan
<GilDash> RAWRity: Underrated I think is the wrong word. Underrepresented maybe.
<TheRainbowDash> Hello Woodenfan! (waves and hugs) How are you today?
<crazypony> hi woodenfan
<RAWRity> SteveCharb: There's a difference between "underrated" and "not a main character"
<Canadian_Brony> yay stream works again!
<Woodenfan> I'm gooooood
<TheRainbowDash> Sumica: Dari's antics even causes physical pain.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wee.
<PinkiePieFTW> she louvs her cube.
<Yukari> one is a lecherous man who borrowed money from his lady friend, no intent on paying back and he thought it was funny he should
<Meanwhile> Dem turrets.
<Gardevoir> HEY who you're calling a moran!?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yay.
<Bobeh> Uh oh
<flutterfriend> lol
<DaringDude> dat voice acting
<Ponies47> O hey Woodenfan well it seems ya'll like it here.
<Meanwhile> Do not get covered in the repulsion gel.
<Kid_Cobalt> Sumica: Crap.....I forgot you had wings....
*Nittany_Discord 11,01gets covered
<Obsidian> Twi pain count 4
<twilight_sprinkler> dammit, poor twi
<TheRainbowDash> Twi is so derp.:D
<Sumica> 00,10lol
<cachi01> celestia died lol
<Litwick> Weeeeee
<flutterfriend> !lol@!
<Freefall29> do not get covered by repulion gel... best instructions ever
<SteveCharb> RAWRity: I'm not asking for her to be a main character, just a little bit more frequently recurring
<Yukari> the lady still Lent him money even though he's clearly stupid
<FlaschenJoe11> This is a nice one.
*Canadian_Brony want's a Portal Gun
<RAWRity> That's like saying Bumi is "underrated" in avatar, simply because he isn't in every episode. Or that Harle Quinn was "underrated" in B:TAS
<DaringDude> aww dis turret
<PinkiePieFTW> she has a pet turret?
<DaringDude> this is such a cute video
<Invi> is the new one actually out yet?
<PinkiePieFTW> lol cute
<RyunosukeKnT> that squee
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Squee
<Obsidian> of course she does
<RAWRity> SteveCharb: she shows up more frequently than most supporting characters, so.....
<flutterfriend> anypony notice how cute fluttershys squeak is?
<TheRainbowDash> A pet turret? I'm afraid it'll shoot me.
<Freefall29> I agree with SteveCharb... Luna needs some more love, as in more screen time
<Woodenfan> Where's the stream at?
<Uakh> fluttershy's sqeak is getting annoying actually
<Uakh> way too much used
<Litwick> Refresh Woodenfan
<Woodenfan> ok
<SteveCharb> RAWRity: no it's not, I recognize when you've got to conserve a character's screentime, like Bluto in Animal House, but Luna IS underrated
<DaringDude> dat logic
<FlaschenJoe11> dat Portal flash in background.
<TheRainbowDash> Sounds like a plan Fluttershy.
<Nabronyan> Through the window?
<Woodenfan> oh yah I love this one
<Nabronyan> Nice.
<Woodenfan> so cute
<Woodenfan> hang on brb
<SteveCharb> Woodenfan: SO cute
<DaringDude> fluttershy has hacks
<flutterfriend> lol forever alone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Flutterhacker.
*FlareChaser|Octavia dies
<Freefall29> HAX! *throws computer monitor*
<PinkiePieFTW> surprise!
<DaringDude> awww her face
<RAWRity> Luna is the only pony not of the Mane 6, CMC, or SPike to have HER OWN EPISODE. She is easily the MOST represented supporting character, having more combind screen time than Zecora, who actually lives within walking distance of ponyville.
<Invi> FlareChaser|Octavia why?
<TheRainbowDash> Nittany_Discord: More like fluttercry.
<crazypony> aaawww
<DaringDude> Awwww
<PinkiePieFTW> tso obvi

<Meanwhile> And then more Avatar.
<SteveCharb> RAWRity: welllllll that's debateable
<PinkiePieFTW> avatards! assemble!
<DaringDude> Sumica: nah its ok
<RAWRity> You want more Luna? that's fine. But she's by no means "underated, or underrepresented"
<Nerom> Mineturtle Says Hello *Explotion*
<flutterfriend> i never saw the last episode
<RyunosukeKnT> I miss winter solstice pt 2?
<Freefall29> she might be a supporting character, but that doesnt mean they automatically get minimal screen time. she gets less screen time then the other supporting characters
<flutterfriend> i miss this show
<PinkiePieFTW> i miss the movie.
<EpicPwnTime3> previously on avatar.............
<PinkiePieFTW> it was a pretty good movie.
<flutterfriend> but the nex series is good and based for an older demographic
<Nabronyan> I miss
<Freefall29> luna has only 1 episode. spike has had about 3 so far, cutie mark crusders about 3.. and so on
<SteveCharb> RAWRity: but you can get where we're coming from, right? I can respect your opinion if your respect mine.
<Nabronyan> Good TV
<flutterfriend> like naruto whats it called

<WallDives> GilDash: I am NOT saying one way or the other. I'm just...observing.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> FLCLPretender: I see why you like this anime so much
<PartyCannon> 75% done
<Sumica> 00,10I prefer if they play nurse
<flutter_spin> I got a question. Besides "Satan Pit" and "Blink", what other awesome Dr. Who episodes (one or two) should I watch to get a more feel of how Doctor Who talks and moves
<GarrettBrony> GilDash this is what I think of when Neomoari hits something with her guitar. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce_PIZ_8bXg
<SteveCharb> GilDash: I know but that was a lot of elipses in a ro
<Dken2021> do like this song

<hen3ry> I demand elipsis of two-and-a-half dots length.

<Woodenfan> CRISIS CITY UGGGGGH
<GilDash> SteveCharb: There used to be. I'm not subscribing to removing the hyphen from every word just yet.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Are you now messing around using the freakin' puctuation marks?!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey Sumica do you have any of the "Tales of" animes ?
<hen3ry> this song has the best lyrics.
<GilDash> Om: That's the idea behind punctuation. ;)
<RAWRity> as JesuOtaku said in her review, "Random" just means doing something crazy and then making sure you never do it again. FLCL is DELIBERATE and CALCULATING in its weirdness.
<Woodenfan> you do realize that I really like that Lyra seapony on thhe lower left right?

<RaveBrony> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: roflmao!!
<Woodenfan> I'm generalizing Sumica, I was never a fan of anime.
<flutter_spin> Is this a show where NOTHING makes sense?
<RAWRity> When he finds out about this, his punishment for the kid responsible: Get him to photoshop him into his own, personal porn collection.
<Dken2021> well it is popular there Woodenfan

<SaxyPretender> 0,14not my manga!
*Ninjazz slaps Alicorn_Prince_Shane with a piece of ply wood
<flutter_spin> I'm confused. Happy, but confused.
<Midnight_Splendor> Save the manga artist.
<hen3ry> kill. your. creator.
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane dodges
<Woodenfan> sigh
*OmegaMetroidBrony is covered in manga paper mache
<PartyCannon> Kill the creator of the manga the show is based off!
<GarrettBrony> Not my anime and manga, those bastards
<Woodenfan> here we go again
<WallDives> see, this is why I like tohoku-ben. the voices are TOLERABLE.
<Midnight_Splendor> Heh
<Trollberry> lol
<RAWRity> In GTO, Onizuka essentially tells the kids "If school is seriously making you unhappy, or you think it's turning you into a bad person, then FUCK the establishment. It's more important to be a good person."
<Dken2021> save the artist, save the world
<flutter_spin> O.o
<OmegaMetroidBrony> :D
<Dermathil> HAHHAHA
<Woodenfan> oh god my head
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...she crazy
<Midnight_Splendor> That artist is the one that created the manga this anime is based of.
<flutter_spin> that's one way to self-insert yourself
<Trollberry> Pinkiepie?
<StupidSexyCJ> dat english
<hen3ry> the VA is the same as the one who did Sailor Moon
<Ninjazz> That girl needs therapy.

<Dermathil> SQUEAKY FLOORY
<WallDives> dat engrish.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This is more odd than FLCL.
<Trollberry> spongebob feet
<flutter_spin> hen3ry: that's why she sounds familiar
<Kandarihu> Oh, I see. That's what they meant by pushing the envelope.
<RAWRity> and considering the tales I've heard from japanese schools, I'd say that's an important lesson to put out there.
<Woodenfan> so is he drawing his own death?
<Dken2021> well at least she isn't friends with Higurashi
<OmegaMetroidBrony> He's drawing manga ponies
<Dark92Enigma> WallDives Kandarihu......Ok, but he didn't die 3 TIMES, like this girl!!
<PartyCannon> Dat family
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol im watching Star wars the Clone wars dem droids are so stupid

<WallDives> Dark92Enigma: it isnt Marvel. Death is a revolving door there.
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Remorse!
<flutter_spin> what the hell are you.. hahaha
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: that's because FLCL had a story they wanted to tell in a weird way. Excel Saga is basically an exercise in trying to give TV cencors ulcers.
<Trollberry> lol
<flutter_spin> I see wut they did
<SaxyPretender> 0,14catfiiiiiiiiiiight
<Dark92Enigma> I seriously need to re watch the final episodes of Yu Yu Hakusho

<Trollberry> rape?
<Dark92Enigma> Gestapo reference? This bitch is crazy!!!!!
<WallDives> GarrettBrony: Honest statement here. if you try to learn japanese legit, you will have to unlearn a lot of shit.
<Woodenfan> I'd love to see a manga/anime where the artist decides everyone's fate in the show itself. Like the Neverending story, ya know?
<PartyCannon> I like both Sumi
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> english dubs of everything makes its more funny
<Sumica> 00,10needs a nice boat
