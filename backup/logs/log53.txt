<NightSeas> 12[08:50] <Quanyails> You're not observing DST? <-- Yes
<Quanyails> 7Huh.
<Quanyails> 7Well, chop off one hour from the time linked above.
<NightSeas> 12k
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, I'm quite unreliable when it comes to requests, but I'll see what I can do :3
<Quanyails> 7That's all right. :P
<Quanyails> 7Your work is so cute. o3o
<HyperMetalLugia> How many times have you said that

<SilverSonic> *ahem* AE, SC
*SilverSonic shot
<Angel_Espeon> 13gah, I was doing well at remembering too =w=
<SilverSonic> XD
<SilverSonic> <Angel_Espeon> Well, I'm quite unreliable when it comes to requests, but I'll see what I can do :3 <--- didnt you say you were gonna draw me something back in May ;o
<Angel_Espeon> 13...and that is a perfect example of why I'm unreliable |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13sometimes I even tell people I'm gonna draw something and then I don't
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's awful, I know ;;
<Angel_Espeon> 13It all depends on how I'm feeling and whether I'm motivated or not
<SilverSonic> mhmm
<Angel_Espeon> 13According to my mum we were supposed to start tidying the house and such today
<Angel_Espeon> 13but she's been playing Farmville all day >>;
<SilverSonic> hmm...well this time, i have an idea somewhat of what you COULD draw AE
<Glacymr> 12yes
<Glacymr> 12SilverSonic struggling at fire temple
<SilverSonic> ?
<Glacymr> 12that would make a perfect drawing :)
<SilverSonic> no
<lightheart> 06!Glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to lightheart for 13 minutes and has to fly lightheart around until then
<SilverSonic> *points to my msn pic* ;) maybe something with the 2 people in that pic ;3
<lightheart> 06thats what you get for calling a cat a taco!
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'll be honest, if I ever feel like drawing that, then I will |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13that's basically how it goes for every "request" I get
<SilverSonic> yeah
<Angel_Espeon> 13so it's more like I'm given an idea, and I may draw it depending on when I feel like it :B
<Angel_Espeon> 13Trust me, my pictures end up looking crappy and awful when I don't have the motivation to do it ;; I suffered two years of Art GCSE to learn that
<SilverSonic> but your drawings are good
<Angel_Espeon> 13You've never seen the bad ones
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Basically, if I don't like the quality of the picture, it doesn't get put on the internet |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13and it most likely gets deleted too LOL
<SilverSonic> XD

<lightheart> 06yes, she tough i was a girl...and maybe still odes
*lightheart flees
<Polarfire> its lonely in here :(
<Angel_Espeon> 13Her very existence on the internet annoys me =w=
<Espeon> 06xD
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Roara|Plush> 6I actually make a point of forgetting about her, ignoring her entirely

<Quanyails> 7Sorry.
<Roara|Plush> 6its ok lol
<Espeon> 06As long as no one approaches her in any way nothing will happen soo
<Espeon> 06yeah

<Quanyails> 7It was just a filler in a lapse of conversation.
<Quanyails> 7I see Feather is awake.

*Ray||ZzZzZ yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawns loudly
<Roara|Plush> 6as for the new pokemon movie
<Roara|Plush> 6meh
<Roara|Plush> 6I'm just gonna watch it for the dragons, as usual
<Roara|Plush> 6the story actually looks somewhat decent, I just can't get over the "parallel universe" thing
<Angel_Espeon> 13I still haven't seen the Arceus movie |D
<Roara|Plush> 6oh god that actually /was/ a good movie
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Ray :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh yeah
<Ray> 02*yanws* Hiya Angel ^^
<Angel_Espeon> 13I 1cc'd PCB again earlier today with Sakuya A
<Ray> 02._____________________________________________________________________________.
<Angel_Espeon> 13it was a lot easier with Sakuya in comparison to when I beat it with Reimu o-o
<Angel_Espeon> 13Probably because she has a good shot type which automatically aims at the nearest enemies
<Angel_Espeon> 13and she gets one more bomb than the other characters
<Angel_Espeon> 13Even Youmu didn't give me half as much trouble as she usually does since my shot-type was powerful enough to dispel her spellcards faster o-o
<Ray> 02o-o
<Roaraway> 6wait
<Roaraway> 6reimu's shot goes towards enemies as well
<Roaraway> 6do you not use homing amulet?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I do use homing amulet, but the shot isn't as powerful as Sakuya's
<Roaraway> 6true
<Roaraway> 6dunno, I find myself having serious trouble deathbombing as sakuya
<Roaraway> 6otherwise I'd use her all the time
<Ray> 02^
<Angel_Espeon> 13Get into the habit of deathbombing just before the bullet actually hits you :P
<Roaraway> 6that would be difficult but yeah
<Angel_Espeon> 13I felt like I didn't have to restrict myself so much with bombs as Sakuya since she gets an extra one
<Roaraway> 6I should
<Roaraway> 6I'm used to bombing right as i get hit, for the sake of sometimes actually avoiding the bullet by some miracle
<Angel_Espeon> 13I managed to get into that habit after playing MoF and SA, which literally give you no time at all to deathbomb xD
<Roaraway> 6thats why MoF is so hard for me
<Roaraway> 6SA...isn't so hard
<Roaraway> 6I just don't play it for some reason lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13SA is incredibly difficult for me LOL
<Roaraway> 6probably cuz I 1ccd it on easy but I want to 1cc everything else first
<Angel_Espeon> 13MoF is a lot easier once you adapt to using your bombs more efficiently
<Roaraway> 6it was ridiculously easy on easy mode
<Roaraway> 6I went into utsuho on my 3rd try with 7 lives
<Roaraway> 6and beat her
<Roaraway> 6normal...I've only played normal all of 2 times
<Angel_Espeon> 13It took me a while to get used to playing SA because I wasn't used to the different shot options you get in that game D:
<Roaraway> 6reimu + suika = awesome
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Roaraway> 6yukari can be fun to have as a partner too
<Roaraway> 6but I accidentally bordered to the other side a few too many times
<Roaraway> 6and died because of it
<Roaraway> 6besides, that game is SO focused on getting items
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've done that LOL
<Roaraway> 6you need all those points for all those lives
<Angel_Espeon> 13well, I do know now that I'm capable of getting to Orin in normal mode now
<Angel_Espeon> 13after countless attempts =w=
<Roaraway> 6I should play that one again
<Roaraway> 6I want to play MoF too, since I adore the characters in that game, and the music, and everything
<Roaraway> 6just
<Roaraway> 6i never ever ever play it
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lack of fullscreen option in MoF is what used to put me off |D Took me a while to get used to playing it windowed
<Angel_Espeon> 13Which reminds me, I still need to beat the extra stage
<Roaraway> 6I never play fullscreen unless it's CtC because that's the default lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13I always play fullscreen, it helps me fit through small gaps between bullets easier :B
<Roaraway> 6true
<Roaraway> 6but I'm used to doing that in windowed :D
*Roaraway 6runs
<Angel_Espeon> 13the good thing about windowed is that you can see more bullets at once
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh, also, did you ever get around to attempting EoSD's extra mode again? Since you worked so hard to unlock that xD
<Roaraway> 6OH GOD LOL
<Roaraway> 6that terifies me
<Roaraway> 6I should try again
<Roaraway> 6cuz yeah, I spent so long getting there
<Roaraway> 6...oh time to go
<Roaraway> 6breakfast :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Enjoy :P

<Chimera> 04hi Aurora :3
<Espeon> 06:3
<drfsupercenter> 03I just got a female Aerodactyl in the dream world
<drfsupercenter> 03that is VERY rare
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<Aurora> 6I still haven't gone to DW
<Aurora> 6and know nothing about i
<Aurora> 6it
<Angel_Espeon> 13Congrats
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<drfsupercenter> 03basically
<drfsupercenter> 03it's the only way to get non stupid Pokémon in BW games
<drfsupercenter> 03well, save for the 10 or so you can get in White Forest/Black City
<Aurora> 6stupid according to your definition
<drfsupercenter> 03as there are NO 5th gens in Dream World :D
<Chimera> 04GOOD for you :D
<drfsupercenter> 03and then it works similarly to earlier games, rare ones are rare etc
<drfsupercenter> 03but females are rarer than males
<drfsupercenter> 03however, you want females
<drfsupercenter> 03because you can breed their natures
<drfsupercenter> 03which are DW exclusive
<Chimera> 04drf
<Aurora> 6their natures are DW exclusive or their abilities?
<Chimera> 04I'm sure EVERYONE here knows this already
<Chimera> 04:P
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<Aurora> 6chimera
<Chimera> 04Their abilities I think
<drfsupercenter> 03abilities, rather
<Aurora> 6I just said
<Aurora> 6I don't know anything about DW
<drfsupercenter> 03why do I keep saying nature LOL
<Aurora> 6 11:50	Aurora	and know nothing about i
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, abilities.
<Chimera> 04k :B
<Chimera> 04lo siento :c
<drfsupercenter> 03You can get exclusive moves as well, but most of those moves can also be taught by breeding or TMs, so it's not as vital
<Chimera> 04well every info site says this already so yeh
<drfsupercenter> 03as in, when breeding, males give away moves and females give away abilities
<drfsupercenter> 03so I basically only look for females
<drfsupercenter> 03with the exception of like Tauros and Nidoran Male :P
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera
<Aurora> 6and you really need however many thousand points to do this?
<drfsupercenter> 03no?>
<drfsupercenter> 03just the more points you get, the more POkémon show up
<Aurora> 6oh
<drfsupercenter> 03at first there's maybe 10
<drfsupercenter> 03then there's 20
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah you can get Pokémon on day 1
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway Chimera
<drfsupercenter> 03most of those sites
<drfsupercenter> 03got their info from bluesun
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03and we're trying to find a programmer so we can make bluesun's DW cheat program
<drfsupercenter> 03that just goes and gets all the Pokémon for you so you don't have to play the stupid minigames XD
<drfsupercenter> 03wow
<drfsupercenter> 03Aerodactyl's BW animation
<drfsupercenter> 03makes it look like it's having a seizure
<Chimera> 04[14:53:18] <%drfsupercenter> 03Chimera
<Chimera> 04[14:53:21] <%drfsupercenter> 03no?>
<Chimera> 04Hm?
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03that no was at Aurora
<Chimera> 04IIRC most sites like Serebii and Bu-
<Chimera> 04oh
<drfsupercenter> 03I meant to say that most of those sites got their info from bluesun :P
<Chimera> 04and they did drf? :P
<drfsupercenter> 03as he pieced together a lot of the data
<drfsupercenter> 03and gave them to someone
<Chimera> 04k
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah

<Angel_Espeon> 13random heavy rain at the moment
<Angel_Espeon> 13I love when it rains so hard the gutter on the roof overflows |D
<SilverSonic> you love rain? o_O
<SilverSonic> meh, i HATE storms
<Angel_Espeon> 13When I'm not caught in it, sure :3
<SilverSonic> lol i always thought you would like jumping in the rain
*SilverSonic shot
<drfsupercenter> 03then that's kinda defeating the purpose
<drfsupercenter> 03of liking rain
<Angel_Espeon> 13I mainly like listening to/watching it xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13But being caught in the rain is pretty awesome too, providing the temperature isn't too cold
<Aurora> 6hot rain isn't exactly fun either though
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate precipitation in general
<drfsupercenter> 03snow just gets annoying as it makes a mess, rain sucks because if you wear glasses being in the rain makes you not able to see...
<Aurora> 6yay contacts
<SilverSonic> lol
<prince-dari> People don't like snow?
<prince-dari> O_o
<drfsupercenter> 03> blue, is it fair to say that most of those sites with info on DW mechanics got it from yo9u?
<drfsupercenter> 03> *you
<drfsupercenter> 03<blue> drf, it probably is
<drfsupercenter> 03<blue> all the extracted art afaik came from my endeavours

<Espeon> 06>theonion
<Aurora> 6I read that without noticing it was onion
<Aurora> 6I thought it was a legit story
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Espeon> 06Lol
<Aurora> 6after a few seconds, I quickly realized I was wrong, managed to look at the title
<Aurora> 6and went ooooh
<Chimera> 04Aurora
<Chimera> 04That would be hilarious if ONN was correct sometimes XD
<Espeon> 06if they accidentally came up with some "Scientists have made <something utterly absurd>"
*Aristeo yawns
<Espeon> 06And the next day it happened
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, like the thing about YouTube looking for people to upload *actually good* videos
<drfsupercenter> 03that seems about true
<Aurora> 6http://dolls.nunodoll.com/stuffed/norwegian.html
<Espeon> 06"Good video" is subjective as hell though
<Aurora> 6^
<Espeon> 06also, floof
<drfsupercenter> 03that's true but most non copyrighted videos on YT are complete crap
<lightheart> 06hey
<lightheart> 06is soemone up for a game of TF2?
<Espeon> 06define complete cr- I won't even bother, xD
<drfsupercenter> 03you get what I'm trying to say :P
<Espeon> 06People trying to be Fred (WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO!?) is certainly annoying.
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Espeon> 06And lightheart, not right now x3
<Aurora> 6hmm
<Aurora> 6I've got 15 minutes

<drfsupercenter> 03floof by mail?
<Aurora> 6it's in the state, and should be fairly close to me
<Aurora> 6it'll arrive tomorrow unless they decide to do the stupid extra day of sorting
<Aurora> 6and then it'll be tuesday
<Espeon> 06xD
<Aurora> 6seriously
<Aurora> 6so when things get shipped, I have two main UPS centers around me
<Aurora> 6one 1 hour north of me, one 30 minutes south
<Aurora> 6and half the time, the package arrives at the center at like 7 in the morning, long before they ship things out
<Aurora> 6and it's STILL THERE at 10pm
<Aurora> 6so it gets sent to me the next day
<Aurora> 6what's worse is when it's shipped the next day, comes to my town's post office, and remains there YET ANOTHER DAY
<Espeon> 06>-<
<Aurora> 6I saw this once when i tracked my package, saw all the stops it took
<Aurora> 6saw it listed in the post office at my town
<Aurora> 6but it was after the office closed
<Aurora> 6I was like NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Aurora> 6I must now respect just how big espeons arre
<Aurora> 6are

<Nick> but yeah arti xai lugia n hawkie came back to my house and we all played the ET atari game xD
<Nick> I have a funny photo of Xai looking like he's actually in pain playing it
<Nick> then we went to a pool hall and played pool and had drinks
*Angel_Espeon has never tried sushi before
<Nick> you'd maybe be surprised
<Nick> I'd reccomend the california hand roll
<Angel_Espeon> 13The smell puts me off a bit, but I'd still like to try it o3o
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'll try almost anything at least once xD

<Nick> LOL
<Angel_Espeon> 13well, I can always smell sushi when I walk past a sushi bar in a shopping centre, so o-o
<Nick> Lugia for some odd reason played it the longest o.o thought it can actually be completed
<Nick> and espy its actually fun to play with a group of people cos then you can laugh together at how bad it is
<Pattyrick> I've never had sushi
*Nick feeds Pattyrick a california hand roll
<Espeon> 06I can certainly agree with that Nick, things that are so bad that you can't stop trying it (like you can't move your eyes from a trainwreck) become exponentially more fun the more people there are |D
<Nick> it was just watching Xai trying to get out one of the holes was just amazingly hilarious

<Quanyails> 7Well, now you can prepare. :3
<ChaoMagma> 4hello to you too Quany
<ChaoMagma> 4:P
<Quanyails> 7Hello, Chao.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Why do I keep getting tempting espeons from DW when I specifically want one based around speed
<Quanyails> 7I really wish you could hack for DW pokemon, Chao. D:
<Angel_Espeon> 13this is the second modest + mischievous one I've gotten now
<Quanyails> 7O_o
<Angel_Espeon> 13with a sp attack stat of 37
<ChaoMagma> 4@Skylands did you mean, it's italic on the chaty chat box? then yes
<Angel_Espeon> 1310 points higher than its speed stat, which is its second highest
<Quanyails> 7You could keep it... X3
<ChaoMagma> 4i wanted to know how you typed it like that
<Barry> Hi
<Angel_Espeon> 13But I want SPEED
<Skylands> 10Well
<Angel_Espeon> 13;-;
<Quanyails> 7Well, keep resetting.
<Quanyails> 7Or abuse the RNG.
<Skylands> 10I did / <insert word here> /
<Quanyails> 7But that'd probably take longer than just resetting. XD
<ChaoMagma> 4oh
<Skylands> 10Without spaces between the slashes
<Quanyails> 7It's a Mibbit thing.
*Nick comes out of dark alley with a long trenchcoat on "ya want speed? I got tha stuff for the right price!"
<Skylands> 10I never knew that worked
<Quanyails> 7It also works with _underlines_
*ChaoMagma 4just learned something
<ChaoMagma> 4ooooooooooooooh!!!!!!!!!1

<ChaoMagma> 4...........
<Quanyails> 7I mean, I've seen them on the GTS, and none are shiny.
<ChaoMagma> 4have you been thinking that i get the pokemon i trade you normally
<Quanyails> 7I know, you fish.
<Quanyails> 7But in the game's coding, you can't get a Shiny Arceus, right? O_o
<Quanyails> 7Like Reshiram and Zekrom and Victini?
<ChaoMagma> 4seriously, you think i'm gonna get a Shiny Modest Latios on my first try :P
*ChaoMagma 4has a Shiny Reshiram and shiny Zekrom :P
<ChaoMagma> 4they're named Reshi and Zek respectively
<ChaoMagma> 4they do exist
<ChaoMagma> 4just, you can't get them under normal conditions
*ChaoMagma 4is sad because he fails greatly at triple battles :(
<Quanyails> 7Eh, just give me a normal one. XD

<Nittany_Tiger> I could set up Manycam and Ustream in little time.
<Quanyails> 7I've heard you can use it to attract o--yep.

<Barry> Hi, Hipster

<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<SirSprinkles> 6Can hear you perfectly.

<Nittany_Tiger> High-pitched interference.
<Nittany_Tiger> It's actually quite funny-sounding.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, you sound fine, dude.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's everything else... Oo
<SirSprinkles> 6I think ALL of the sound is coming from your mic.
<SirSprinkles> 6So it's getting feedback sound.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
*Nickario throws ET cartridges all over Hawkie
<Hawkie> 07Nooooooo

<Flutterpeanut> 13Yeah

<Hipster_Brony> yep
<Hipster_Brony> same as before
<Flutterpeanut> 13Live again
<Nittany_Tiger> Zero sound.
<Hipster_Brony> no sound at all now
<Hipster_Brony> at least no "TRIAL
<Hipster_Brony> "
<Flutterpeanut> 13restarting it
<Flutterpeanut> 13again
<Nittany_Tiger> And the trial is back.
<Nittany_Tiger> And the video has no sound.
<Skylands> 10Ohai Sheena
<SheenaFox> hi thar Skylands
<Light_Latias> 12hai Sheena
<Flutterpeanut> 13...I give up
<Flutterpeanut> 13D:
<SheenaFox> hi LL :D
<Hipster_Brony> DCD is apparently going to be around a lot more since hes on vacation
<Hipster_Brony> he can probably help
<Hipster_Brony> tomorrow or something
<Nittany_Tiger> Who normally runs stream?
<Nittany_Tiger> Isn't it Sprinkles?
<Flutterpeanut> 13DCD
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD
<Flutterpeanut> 13SPrinkles is a backup streamer
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm backup
<Flutterpeanut> 13We'll see what DCD has on the matter
<Nittany_Tiger> K
<Flutterpeanut> 13if not then I just downloaded a bunch of shit that will be deleted
<Flutterpeanut> 13xD
<Hipster_Brony> i know that feel
<Hipster_Brony> my internet absolutely flies, but my video card couldnt handle the stream
<Flutterpeanut> 13and I'll ask Dari if he totally would take like a week to script that. Which would be terrible, actually.
<Hipster_Brony> script what?
<Nittany_Tiger> What is your video card?
<Nittany_Tiger> Nevermind.
<Flutterpeanut> 13I recall being on a streaming site that gave different tabs for streams or something, and if he could somehow embed my livestream on here too. But Honestly, that coding would be a dickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
<Nittany_Tiger> For this site?
<Flutterpeanut> 13mmhm.
<Flutterpeanut> 13Procaster and Livestream.com work perfectly for me.
<Nittany_Tiger> You're site's probably CSS and/or HTML.
<Nittany_Tiger> I know some people that know CSS.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's CSS/HTML
<Nittany_Tiger> I know some people that know that.
<Nickario> off to sleep
<Nickario> night all
<SirSprinkles> 6I used to know CSS, but it's been FOREVER.
<Angel_Espeon> 13goodnight Nick :3
<SirSprinkles> 6I still know HTML like the back of my hand though.
<Nickario> night angel
<Nittany_Tiger> I know mainly C, though I knew more C back in college than now because I didn't use it for a while.
<Light_Latias> 12ohai Angel
<Nittany_Tiger> If I re-learn strings, I could build a better random list organizer for this site.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or use Perl.
<NightSeas> 12Angel floof cake :D
<SirSprinkles> 6We don't really need a random list organizer though.
<Nittany_Tiger> Random.org is just a fancy random number generator and probably python.
<Nittany_Tiger> I know.
<Nittany_Tiger> But it would make for a fun project.
<SirSprinkles> 6A fun and pointless one...
<Nittany_Tiger> What better way to learn strings and random number seeding.
<Nittany_Tiger> (and pointers if you want to use those instead of array indices).
<SirSprinkles> 6I can think of many better ways, personally...
<Nittany_Tiger> I want to relearn pointers in C. Those are easy, and I used to be able to use them like a boss.
<Nittany_Tiger> Yeah.
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh... btw.

<Barry> at*
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't have enough points to even get Lileep in DW yet |D
<Flygia> It's one of my older TST names ^^;
<Flygia> Original was Leafwing.
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai :3
<Flygia> -Wavewave.-
<Quanyails> 7Lol, AE.
*Skylands somewhat recalls seeing that name around
<Quanyails> 7Hrm...
<Flygia> This site has changed so much in the past few years o.o

<Quanyails> 7I don't suppose you're into IV breeding, AE? :P
<Flygia> You prolly did see me around.
<Quanyails> 7You're still resetting for that Espeon?
<Flygia> I used to be on here all the freaking time.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yep, I'm still working on it |D
<Skylands> 10You're the one with Tales Of Vesperia avatar?
<Angel_Espeon> 13And I've never tried IV breeding before
<Flygia> Yup.
<Angel_Espeon> 13The furthest I ever go is nature and characteristic
<Skylands> 10I found your profile with ease
<Skylands> 10And, Repede~
<Flygia> I bet xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13then a quick check on an IV calculator
<Flygia> Repede for the win.
<Angel_Espeon> 13but they're not very accurate when the Pokemon is lv 1
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Flygia> But. Off topic! xD
<Quanyails> 7Go to Battle Institute.
<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04Ohai
<Skylands> 10Off topic is welcomed in here
<Flygia> Yah. I know.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I do spend a lot of game time breeding though, so I could always try it out sometime :P
<Quanyails> 7You know it's just a quick way to check your pokemon's level 50 stats?
<NightSeas> 12[18:46] <Skylands> I found your profile with ease <-- Stalker XD
*NightSeas runs
<Flygia> xD
<Flygia> Pff. It's not hard to stalk me.
<Flygia> For some reason, people I don't know, know me on here o.o;
<Skylands> 10Forum > Members > Search for members > profit
<Drake> 04You forgot the ??? step Sky
*Drake hides
<Skylands> 10There's no mystery behind TST's search engine :P
<Quanyails> 7Oh, yeah, Drake?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well I could try IV breeding, but it'd take some time since I'll be away for the next 2 weeks and won't have internet access and such |D
<Quanyails> 7The TF2 game's time is up.
<Drake> 04I saw
<Quanyails> 7How's it?
<NightSeas> 12Then it would be Forum > ??? > Members > Search for members > profit
*NightSeas runs
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
*Flygia hits her head against her keyboard.
<Flygia> Its so hard being in two chats at once! x.x
<Quanyails> 7o3o
<Skylands> 10lrn2multitask
<Drake> 04Am I too assume CEST is basically Eastern Standard Time?
<Flygia> Lol. I'm on a site called F-List right now. Pff. I'm spazzing about ponies.
<Quanyails> 7CEST is Central European Summer Time.
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Drake> 04Nevermind then
<Quanyails> 7EDT would be EST + DST.
<NightSeas> 12A lot of people are
<Skylands> 10If F list is what I think it is...
<Skylands> 10Ohmy.
<Flygia> ?
<Skylands> 10Nothing
<NightSeas> 12Dunno, she's odd like that
*NightSeas runs
<Flygia> It's a RP site. ... With some people who need to put soap in their muzzles.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Anyway Quan, since you brought it up I'm assuming you had a Pokemon in mind that you wanted to be IV bred? o3o
<Quanyails> 7Yes to an extent.
<Skylands> 10So I was right :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13Because I could try, if you want xD It'll give me something to do
<Quanyails> 7I'm looking for proper IVs, HP, and Ability. XD
<Quanyails> 7HP as in Hidden Power.
<NightSeas> 12I’ve actually never been on F-List. But according to what I’ve heard, I don’t want to
<Drake> 04The Pokemon's Hidden Power is determined by IVs isn't it?
<Flygia> Pff. Not everything is super horrible bad.
<Quanyails> 7Yep.
<Quanyails> 7But my desired HP can't have perfect IVs. D:
<NightSeas> 12No, but people have preferences
<Skylands> 10!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Skylands, you are a 6Aipom.
<drf|laptop> 03http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/funny-graphs-creepy-mc-creeper.jpg

*Quanyails 7erases her last few statements.
<Flygia> Remember Leafwing?
<Drake> 04?
<Light_Latias> 12o.o

<drf|laptop> 03gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood stupid out of print CDs
<drf|laptop> 03I am not paying $200 for one CD but :/
<drf|laptop> 03it may be the only way
<Aurora> what CD?
<drf|laptop> 03Transformers: The Score
<drf|laptop> 03from the 2007 movie
<drf|laptop> 03apparently they were dumb and didn't make anywhere near enough
<Aurora> why on earth would that be out of print
<Aurora> oh
<drf|laptop> 03Good question
<drf|laptop> 03but go look it up
<drf|laptop> 03all you can get is the mp3s
<drf|laptop> 03I want the actual disc for collection value
<drf|laptop> 03as it's like one of the best movie scores ever
<drf|laptop> 03and they also derped up with the 3rd movie
<drf|laptop> 03apparently the CD didn't get Michael Bay's approval until like 2 days before the set release date so they wer elike "Um... yeah, digital only" >_> so therefore a physical version doesn't exist
<Aurora> forgot to look for that one too lol
<Aurora> add it to my collection of movie soundtracks
*Aurora searches for one
<drf|laptop> 03mp3s?
<drf|laptop> 03as I have them
<Aurora> oh lol
<Aurora> can I have?
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<Aurora> also, why do you want the actual cd then
<Aurora> wait
<Aurora> nvm
<Aurora> I read what you said
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03it's like saying why do you want a plush when you can just take a picture of one
<Aurora> yeah
<Aurora> well
<drf|laptop> 03I think the concept of paying for data is stupid, if I'm going to buy something I want to be able to hold it in my hands, you know?
<drf|laptop> 03I really just pirate music I don't care about XD
<Aurora> yeh
<drf|laptop> 03and eh, I don't have my web servper set up yet
<drf|laptop> 03*server
<drf|laptop> 03but I can get you download links
<Aurora> k
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.filesonic.com/file/1358426694/Transformers_-_Dark_of_the_Moon__The_Score__320kbps.rar
<drf|laptop> 03that's the newest one
<Aurora> nah, I really only liked the first lol
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<Link> o-o
<Link> who broke the internet
*Link shot
<drf|laptop> 03http://www.megaupload.com/?d=X0KWX72J
<drf|laptop> 03that's the first one
<drf|laptop> 03there's also a bootleg version (which I bought on ebay XD) that has like 50 tracks instead of 20
<drf|laptop> 03if you want that too
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<drf|laptop> 03waaaaait woooooah
<drf|laptop> 03this is a *two disc* one
<drf|laptop> 03my bootleg is only one
<drf|laptop> 03I so want that
<drf|laptop> 03http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/2599/transformersback.jpg
<drf|laptop> 03fricking ton of tracks
<Light_Latias> 12LOL
<drf|laptop> 03the bootleg one
<drf|laptop> 03only shows the people
<drf|laptop> 03not the robots
<drf|laptop> 03as you can see from the back
<drf|laptop> 03it's so silly
<Aurora> wth 50? o.o
<drf|laptop> 03and the actual cover is insanely pixelated
<drf|laptop> 03http://cgi.ebay.com/TRANSFORMERS-EXP-Steve-Jablonsky-89-MIN-SCORE-NEW-EDT-/140579207135?pt=Music_CDs&hash=item20bb2c77df
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, that
<Aurora> thats a ton of music there
<drf|laptop> 0350 tracks
<drf|laptop> 03but look at the artwork, it's so stupid looking LOL:
<Arcanine> 12sit
<Aurora> yeah lol
<drf|laptop> 03and on the actual disc
<drf|laptop> 03if you look at where the 3 people are
<Arcanine> 12stupid looking you say
<drf|laptop> 03it's pixelated
<drf|laptop> 03because they basically zoomed in the real album cover which has them in the far distance
<Arcanine> 12what's the best way to destroy the quality of an image?
<drf|laptop> 03http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gg%2Bz6Xi4L.jpg
<drf|laptop> 03that's the real one, notice how small the people are :P
<drf|laptop> 03and um, Arcanine, convert it back and forth to jpg a bunch of times? XD
<Arcanine> 12back and forward
<Arcanine> 12so from jpg to what?
<drf|laptop> 03png
<Arcanine> 12takes 2 to tango
<drf|laptop> 03or something
<Arcanine> 128D

<drf|laptop> 03why did I read that as "going to regret last night"
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Yup
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02THanks Umbreon :3
<Glacymr> 12because you misread everything drf

<drf|laptop> 03why the D:? That would be a GOOD thing if you weren't creepily young compared to me :P
<Aurora> I think it's annoying when people call girls "foxes"
<Aurora> I don't find it at all flattering tbh
<SheenaFox> er, Aurora
<SheenaFox> look at my nick
<SheenaFox> LOL
<drf|laptop> 03is it any worse than just saying someone's hot?
<Aurora> I think hot is horrible too
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<SheenaFox> or that reason D:
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Aurora> sheena I'm not talking about that kind of fox
<drf|laptop> 03depends on the person I suppose
<Aurora> granted I could have just said that in skype
<drf|laptop> 03some girls don't mind it and consider it a compliment :P
<Aurora> but I can talk to you here too lol
<drf|laptop> 03LOL you guys are voice chatting?
<Aurora> yeah we usually do
<SheenaFox> no

<Aurora> I wish we had one around here that was showing it :|
<drf|laptop> 03come out to michigan, we have the country's 4th largest theater :P
*Shiny-Growlithe jumps up on Roara's head
<Aurora> ok so
<Aurora> the imax in san jose
<Aurora> whenever they go to do a show, they have this opening sequence where they light up the speakers in the back
<drf|laptop> 03OH
<Aurora> so you can see where they are, while the screen also explains what each does
<drf|laptop> 03I just remembered
<Aurora> the whole sequence is like a minute
<drf|laptop> 03I secretly filmed the Henry Ford IMAX
<drf|laptop> 03intro0
<drf|laptop> 03that one's over a minute too
<Aurora> but the music they play during it, it's lovely
<drf|laptop> 03remind me tomorrow
<drf|laptop> 03and I'll upload it
<Aurora> I've been trying to figure out if that music is something specifically for imax, or something I can get ahold of
<drf|laptop> 03take your camera next time?
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03your phone

<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Aurora> they didn't show HTTYD when it came out
<drf|laptop> 03the Henry Ford didn't show Transformers 3 :(
<Kyu> 07tech museum?
<drf|laptop> 03Or HTTYD
<Aurora> which was like...the one thing I wanted to see there
<Aurora> yeh kyu
<drf|laptop> 03but they showed HP7.1 and 2
<drf|laptop> 03so eh

<Aurora> I hope they do the intro for the actual movie
<drf|laptop> 03the video itself is just completely black
<drf|laptop> 03it's just the audio
<drf|laptop> 03which is still fine
<Aurora> since that's what they use for the normal videos they play there
<Kyu> 07we should watch it together XP
<Aurora> I dunno what day I'm going
<drf|laptop> 03the Henry Ford does their custom intro for every movie, unless they're running late (due to long lines etc0
<Aurora> and my mom might be taking me
<Kyu> 07ah

<Light_Latias> 12night all
<Pattyrick> Hello
<SilverSonic> hi
<Pattyrick> Hi SS
<NightSeas> 12Hey Pattyrick :3
<Pattyrick> Hi GL =D
<Pattyrick> How is everybody doin'?
<NightSeas> 12I'm doing pretty good, you?
<Pattyrick> I'm good
<Drake|Index> 04o-o
<Pattyrick> got a lot of sleep last night, so I feel better :3
<Drake> 04I still had that nick?
<NightSeas> 12Yep
<NightSeas> 12For hours I think |D
<SilverSonic> *sigh* I had to deal with 3 idiots today ._.
<NightSeas> 12IRL or online?
<Pattyrick> or both?
<SilverSonic> online
<SilverSonic> on a diff server
<NightSeas> 12Because I have to deal with idiots everyday online
*NightSeas runs
<SilverSonic> my gf sent me some logs and this made me po'd
<SilverSonic> Raxz: today is national weed day -- oops i mean Silvers birthday! <==
<SilverSonic> btw, its not my birthday at all :p
<NightSeas> 12You're sure there not just joking?
<SilverSonic> no. hes an idiot on SC
<SilverSonic> >_>
<SilverSonic> I HATE him
<NightSeas> 12I just don’t take anyone seriously online
<NightSeas> My attitude is either deal with it or troll face when someone don’t like me xD
<SilverSonic> or do what i did and be a complete and total ass to anyone that tried to get in my way over there :p
<NightSeas> 12However, if what the person is saying is true, then I listen
<NightSeas> 12Like when NS asks me to stop doing something XD
<SilverSonic> xD
<SilverSonic> yeah, hes a 14 year old idiot. im talking about Raxz btw ;p
<NightSeas> 12lol
<SilverSonic> and he kept saying i had a pot head, which made no sense
<Xanbreon> a head made of pot, makes perfect sense
<SilverSonic> [03:14] <voice> <SilverSonic> God, why must you idiots always involve her <-- why does silver have a pot leaf head? <--- THIS really po'd me
<NightSeas> 12Pot head= empty head which = dumb
*NightSeas runs
<Xanbreon> airhead
<NightSeas> 12Yeah, just like airhead
<SilverSonic> :P
<Pattyrick> Cherry Airheads are good, but not the airhead kind of person
<NightSeas> 12POT HEAD >|
<Xanbreon> means something else
<NightSeas> 12It just sounds immature no matter how you say it xD
<Xanbreon> Dont do drugs kids
<Pattyrick> and don't drink alcoholic beverages
<NightSeas> 12Ew alcoholic beverages
<Xanbreon> Do both at once, its twice the fun
<Pattyrick> 0__o
<NightSeas> 12Real men use alcoholic beverages to communicate
<Xanbreon> Grunts and burps
<NightSeas> 12Yep
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<Pattyrick> bye GL
<Pattyrick> I don't used alcoholic beverages
<Pattyrick> I much prefer to drink a Shirly Temple because it LOOKS alcoholic but isn't

<Angel_Espeon> 13'Kay I know for a fact that this is a LOT easier said than done, but the best you can do is to just not involve yourself with this person at all and focus on your relationship with LL
<drf-Droid> well when they're more active here than LL... :/
<drf-Droid> also sigh, quiz, brb
<Arcanine> 12hi Angel_Espeon`~
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, just keep telling yourself that those two have got nothing to do with you. You shouldn't ever compare yourself with other people, especially when they've supposedly got more of something that you want
<Angel_Espeon> 13Life's too short to deal with things that aren't worth your time
<Angel_Espeon> 13Like I said, easier said than done |D But I know for a fact that it's just a phase and you'll get over it in time
<Angel_Espeon> 13and hai Arcanine :3 /late
<Arcanine> 12lol

<SilverSonic> blah, that song is kinda bland to be honest
<NewDCD> 9can you see the static?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yep
<MrPoniator> Pass the link
<MrPoniator> I'm using my own client, so I don't have the page open
<NewDCD> 9http://dinkypage.com/bronystate
<NewDCD> 9how's the quality, hip?
<Hipster_Brony> 8hard to read text
<Hipster_Brony> 8quality is pretty low
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9give me a second
<drf-Droid> I grew up with it so I love it XD
<MrPoniator> Preparing for the Snatcher, or?
<Arcanine> 12i need a OoT person
<NewDCD> 9that should do it
<NewDCD> 9yeah we're just making tests
<MrPoniator> Alright
<NewDCD> 9no, it doesn't fix the low quality
<NewDCD> 9weird
<NewDCD> 9I think the quality is much better now, ja?
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<drf-Droid> I'd text LL for you but she appears to not have her phone with her
<Hipster_Brony> 8much, much better
<Arcanine> 12hmm
<Arcanine> 12i wouldn't ask you to go to that extent for me anyway
<drf-Droid> when we text all the time it isn't that big of a deal
<MrPoniator> Will there be someone talking on the mic?
<Arcanine> 12lol
<MrPoniator> Or just plain gameplay along with chat?
<Hipster_Brony> 8regular gameplay
<NewDCD> 9normally I just play with the gamepad
<MrPoniator> Ok
<NewDCD> 9let's test to see if I should use Gamepad Shooting
<NewDCD> 9or Mouse Lightgun
<NewDCD> 9a sec
<MrPoniator> Snatcher ain't that bad with just gamepad
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9the gamepad actually feels great in this game
<NewDCD> 9maybe I should ask the audience for their preference
<MrPoniator> Heh, I played snatcher on an arcade stick
<NewDCD> 9....dude, that sounds awesome
<NewDCD> 9Hipster, I think I have learned of a way to make the quality of our streams to be much, much better
<NewDCD> 9because I think this has good quality right here

<NewDCD> 9...there was a Sdatcher thread in Ponychan?
<NewDCD> 9sup Barry
<Arcanine> 12lol
<Damos> the days are going by so fast

<drf-Droid> I don't
<NewDCD> 9not much, testing stuff for tonight's stream

<NewDCD> 9let's test something
<NewDCD> 9>BIG BOSS
<NewDCD> 9you might recognize this guy from Portable Ops. Somewhat
<Barry> Do you mean Big Boss from Metal Gear?
<NewDCD> 9Cunningham was also a character in Portable Ops
<NewDCD> 9only he was black there
<MrPoniator> Yeah, Kojima sure likes to put references
<NewDCD> 9RESPECT MAH AUTHORITAY

<NewDCD> 9mouse for some reason shoots to the screen right below the one you're actually aiming at
<MrPoniator> :U
<NewDCD> 9I think that about wraps up the testing section
<MrPoniator> That's kinda weird
<Barry> A little Metal Gear va trivia: The Japanese voice actor of the Metal Gear Solid character Big Boss is the same as the Japanese va for Dr. Eggman from Sonic.

<Damos> how was that
<drf|laptop> 03....
<drf|laptop> 03apparently that song Alone Again, is only available in the Canadian iTunes store, not the American one
<Damos> !drfy
<drf|laptop> 03yeah OK um, I think I'll just go try to pirate it then
<Damos> !pokemon

*Angel_Espeon already belongs to you, silly :P
*Angel_Espeon already belongs to Espeon and Aurora, you thief D:
<Aurora> woot
<Pattyrick> AE belongs to 2 people?
<Kyu> 07lol
<Pattyrick> Cannot computer
*Pattyrick explodes
<Aurora> lol
<Pattyrick> *compute xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13the fact that it triggers both responses bothers me |D
<Angel_Espeon> 13Pretend the second one isn't there >w>
<Sneas> 03It worked. Yay!
*Sneas runs
<Link> lmfao
<Aurora> what does your script say?
<Skylands> 10o.o
<Aurora> mine should be similar to espeon's
<Link> Sneas + Rape = Hollywood Movie
<Angel_Espeon> 13on *:TEXT:*!Angel_Espeon*:#: {
<Angel_Espeon> 13if ($nick = Aurora) { describe $chan already belongs to you, silly :P }
<Angel_Espeon> 13if ($nick = Espeon) { describe $chan already belongs to you, silly :3 }
<Angel_Espeon> 13else { describe $chan already belongs to Espeon and Aurora, you thief D: }
<Angel_Espeon> 13}
*Link shot
<Aurora> in terms of trigger
<Aurora> ...
<Sneas> 03o.o
<Link> </random>
<Angel_Espeon> 13I didn't make the script though, so I dunno how to edit it |D
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03try changing that second if to an else if
<Aurora> that looks like it should work lol
<drf|laptop> 03because the way that works
<drf|laptop> 03it sees the first if
<drf|laptop> 03then the second and else are treated as one
<drf|laptop> 03so
<drf|laptop> 03if nick = Aurora, do this
<drf|laptop> 03if nick = Espeon, do this, otherwise do this
<drf|laptop> 03hence Aurora triggers both
<drf|laptop> 03that make sense?
<drf|laptop> 03so try changing the second line to "else if"
<Angel_Espeon> 13'kay, see if that works now
<Aurora> !Angel_Espeon
*Angel_Espeon already belongs to you, silly :P
<Aurora> yep
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yay :D
<Aurora> 6:>

<drf|laptop> 03!Angel_Espeon
<Angel_Espeon> 13Thanks drf :3
*Angel_Espeon already belongs to Espeon and Aurora, you thief D:
<drf|laptop> 03yeah OK
<drf|laptop> 03no problem
<drf|laptop> 03I'm not that great at scripts but I have experienced a similar problem before XD
<drf|laptop> 03God dang it canada
<drf|laptop> 03"available on iTunes everywhere' is such a lie
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<drf|laptop> 03as itunes itself says Canada only
<drf|laptop> 03I WANT THAT ALBUM :|

<drf|laptop> 03also @ album title, you just lost it
*drf|laptop hides
<Aurora> 6ok
<Aurora> 6gonna have two plushes going simultaneously
<drf|laptop> 03I misread plushes as plugins
<Roara|Plush> 6so until my fur arrives
<Roara|Plush> 6I'm gonna work on my second one
<Espeon> 06=w=
<Roara|Plush> 6I'll give you a hint

*Roara|Plush 6runs :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Lolwhat
<HyperMetalLugia> TURRET PLUSH
<Angel_Espeon> 13TURRET
<Angel_Espeon> 13<3
<Light_Latias> 12<3
<HyperMetalLugia> It's different
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<HyperMetalLugia> ohai LL
<Light_Latias> 12hai
<Roara|Plush> 6hello~? I'm different~?
<Pattyrick> Portal Turret plush = EPIC
<Roara|Plush> 6-~
<Roara|Plush> 6dwafmsgd
<drf|laptop> 03is it going to have actual LEDs?
<drf|laptop> 03er
<Skylands> 10Bah, TST forum went down (and yes, I realize it was supposed to)
<drf|laptop> 03lasers
<drf|laptop> 03etc
<Roara|Plush> 6I wish lol
<Pattyrick> Imagine if it said 'I won't hurt you' with its funny little turret voice
<drf|laptop> 03shoudln't be that hard to do if you get a laser pointer
<drf|laptop> 03and just cut a hole in the fabric
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<Pattyrick> that'd be unsafe for little children to point in their eyes :|
<Roara|Plush> 6my plushes are 100% huggable, nothing solid or potentially harmful inside
<Pattyrick> they'd probably just put little red lights
<HyperMetalLugia> So 5mw is going to kill you?
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Pattyrick> ok, good :P
<Sneas> 03wah

<Cat> rawrawrawrawrawr
<Charles> hi
<Cat> there, slightly less quiet
<Cat> hello!
<Cat> hooray
<Cat> I just thought I'd say things to liven the place up
<Charles> I try and encourage conversation from time to time, but no one ever seems to be around
<Cat> Sad times
<Charles> yes, where hath they all gone?
<Cat> I didn't kill any of them with a rake, promise!
<Kjakings> hey
<Kjakings> 7whoops
<Charles> ...you said nothing about other gardening tools though, and there is a bloody hoe sitting in the corner over there
<Cat> I was gonna try and get people's attention so I could see if there's anyone available to add on Google+ :P
<Charles> I am
<Cat> :O
<Cat> Can I put you in my acquaintances circle?
<Charles> yes you may
<Cat> I like putting people in circles
<Charles> Charles Loftis
<Cat> much better than boxes
<Cat> :o
<Cat> I did it!
<Cat> yay people
<Cat> Hopefully I got the right person
<RN|afk> We're going out for a bit now, see you all another time
<Pattyrick> bye RN =D
<Charles> yup, nice hat
<Cat> thanks ^^
<Charles> would you say that setting the affinity of a program to use only 1 core would be an effective way to determine how well a game would run on a single core machine?
<Cat> Probably not
<Cat> If the game doesn't require multiple cores, it won't make any difference, and if it does, it won't run on your machine :P
<Cat> you can set the priority of the program if I recall though
<Charles> yes, but I meant trying to simulate single core working conditions
<Cat> are you on a single core pc?
<Cat> setting affinity won't stop it using the other cores if it needs to use them if I remember correctly
<Charles> no, quad core. I was playing L4D2 an hour ago, and just for curiosity sake I turned off cores 1 through 3, and left core 0 active
<Light_Latias> 12ohnoes
<Cat> it'll just always try to use the core you set an affinity for first
<Charles> or, more likely, told the game to not use those cores
<Light_Latias> 12Skull Kid ripped me off D:
<Charles> ah
<Charles> ok
<Cat> actually, ignore me
<Cat> I just clicked the affinity dialogue
<Cat> and it's which cores is the program allowed to use
<Cat> hmm
<Charles> well, I did notice some performance decrease
<Charles> now I want to see if I can limit the GPU usage to simulate an underpowered 512MB card, and maybe limite the RAM used to 2 gigs max
<Cat> the Source engine is designed to be able to make use of multiple cores
<Cat> so I'm not surprised you saw a performance decrease tbh
<Charles> I have a friend with a 2.8Ghz single core machine, 2 gigs of RAM, and a Nvidia Ion GPU, 512 MB
<Charles> I want to sim that condition so I can see what games will run on his comp
<Cat> I see
<Cat> I'm glad I don't have a machine like that
<Charles> lol
<Charles> yeah, he only ever buys refurbished and older models to save money
<Angel_Espeon> 13I swear my memory is fading
<Angel_Espeon> 13since TST's in maintenance mode, I went to deviantart instead
<Espeon> 06oo
<Angel_Espeon> 13then after going through a few new messages, I opened a new tab and typed in lugia.us/forum
<Cat> I'd have the most epic pc ever if I had a proper income
<Roara|Plush> 6lol
<Cat> currently it's just pretty damn awesome
<Angel_Espeon> 13I've actually done that several times now within the past 10 minutes .w.
<Charles> really?
<Charles> specs?
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's just my first instinct to open a TST tab if I don't already have one open D:
<Cat> 3.4Ghz Phenom II X4 cpu
<Cat> Nvidia GTX460 gpu
<Cat> 8GB Corsair XMS3 DDR3 ram
<Cat> two western digital caviar hard drives, one 500GB, one 1.5TB
<Link> XD
*Skylands has TST set up as her homepage on Firefox
<Cat> a corsair 650W PSU that I can't remember the name of
<Cat> a DVB TV Tuner card that I forget the make of
<Armads> rofl
<Cat> on a Gigabyte full-ATX motherboard that again, I can't remember the model of :P
<Cat> in an Antec 300 case with extra front fans installed by me
<Armads> Mine too @angel :(
<Cat> with two 24" widescreen monitors
<Charles> :/ crap I want your PC, all I am running is a 3.2 Ghz Phenom II x4, a 1 gig Radeon HD 5770, 4 gigs of RAM, 320gig HDD, and a small tower with a carrying handle and a few extra fans, 1 120 in front, and an 80mm on the side, plus the 92mm in back, and the 600 watt PSU
<Charles> I only have 1 23" monitor, but I plan on getting a second
<Cat> I'm planning to get either a watercooling system for my CPU, or an SSD next
<Roara|Plush> 6I love how I decided to make a turret plush all of ten minutes ago
<Roara|Plush> 6well
<Roara|Plush> 6ok
<Roara|Plush> 6 30
<Roara|Plush> 6but
<Roara|Plush> 6I haven't bothered to think it through much
<Roara|Plush> 6I'm just cutting fabric here hoping for the best
<Roara|Plush> 6but I just realized
<Roara|Plush> 6I don't have much stuffing
<Roara|Plush> 6enough for the turret
<Roara|Plush> 6but the espeon....not enough

<Dman> EVERY DAY
<Dman> So if all this week it's 'snatcher,' yet there's specials every day, um... Is there one movie every day with different episodes?
<SirSprinkles> 6Suddenly Dman
<Dman> Suddenly yes
<Dman> Hey there Sprinkles :)
<SirSprinkles> 6No, no movies. We'll be showing different things, that we normally don't get a chance to show.
<Dman> Ah
<Dman> so like an extended 'preshow' type thing? Well, sounds good, i hope the test run goes well
<SirSprinkles> 6Again, this week's a test run.
<Dman> I can't make every friday or saturday, so I'd like this ^^
<SirSprinkles> 6Good then. Glad to please others with our ideas. : D
<Dman> 2 hours until Snatcher?
<Dman> OFC i like your idea : D
<Dman> also, i google 'snatcher interactive movie' and your poll comes up before any actual websites on snatcher lul
<Dman> Hideo Kojima? I'm not reading any more, I wanna see this first hand : P
<NewDCD> 9Hideo Kojima, yeah
<Dman> Hi there DCD, I haven't really seen you talk much. Probably cuz i'm not here all the time. So...um, do you like this game?
<NewDCD> 9are you kidding?
<NewDCD> 9I LOVE IT!
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 04HyperMetalLugia is paired with Skylands <HyperMetalLugia> Successful ship <3 <Skylands>10 Love at first ship~
<NewDCD> 9also I'm the main Friday streaming, but due to personal reasons I haven't been around xD (Final Exams)
<Dman> Great! So how's this gonna work?
<NewDCD> 9that's done though, so expect to see me around a lot
<Roara|Plush> 6this is such a soft fabric
<Dman> I mean, if there's too many bronies we ... vote?
<NewDCD> 9well, Snatcher is pretty linear
<Dman> Oh ok
<NewDCD> 9and if someone does "say something"
<NewDCD> 9doing it won't really have much of an effect in the end
<Light_Latias> 12wbs Sky
<NewDCD> 9BUT I'll do it anyways
<Dman> I'm sure many people will say stuff all the time. : P
<Skylands> 10Thanks
<Dman> Sounds like a good plan
<NewDCD> 9because they can unearth hilarious and entertaining stuff in the game
<Dman> Everypony will feel involved that way - best livestream scenario
<NewDCD> 9I've already streamed this game before
<HyperMetalLugia> WB Sky <3

<Glacymr> 12i'm fishing so yeah
<Glacymr> 12i'm close to the water XD
<Manlyguy> The biggest fish is under the log near the front entrance.
<Manlyguy> I meant if you were actually in it. My bad. lol
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Light_Latias> 12the log is near the back I thought
<Light_Latias> 12brb
<Glacymr> 12yes i'm in the water
<Manlyguy> Well, there's a log somewhere. xD
<Glacymr> 12there is multiple logs
<Manlyguy> Wherever it is, the biggest fish likes to hide in it.
<Manlyguy> It's, like, uhhh, how do I describe...
<Manlyguy> I need a picture, lol.
<Manlyguy> http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda05/Fishing/FishingPond_BigFish1.gif
<Manlyguy> There ya go. That's exactly where, lol.
<Light_Latias> 12back
<HyperMetalLugia> WB LL
<HyperMetalLugia> Brbs
<Light_Latias> 12thats nearer to the beck :P
<Light_Latias> 12*back
<Light_Latias> 12tys
<Glacymr> 12i've been at this for hours but the biggest i've caught was like 8 inches
<Manlyguy> I'm going by memory, haha.
<Glacymr> 12everything else either doesn't take the bait or gets away
<Light_Latias> 12as was I ;3
<Light_Latias> 12Glacy
<Manlyguy> Yeah, but you're memory doesn't suck like mine. p:
<Light_Latias> 12you have to wiggle and jerk it
<Manlyguy> Therefore I win.
<Light_Latias> 12that'll catch their attention
<HyperMetalLugia> LL, that sounded
<HyperMetalLugia> nvm...
<HyperMetalLugia> z.z
<Light_Latias> 12and out of context...yah
<Light_Latias> 12that was a gutter-mind's paradise of a phrase
<Manlyguy> That's why it's best to get as near as you can to the fish, but not close enough to scare them.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup :|
<Manlyguy> It gives you more wiggle room.
*Light_Latias 12suddently lolz
<Light_Latias> 12but
<Light_Latias> 12Glacy
<Light_Latias> 12make sure
<Light_Latias> 12you do NOT
<Light_Latias> 12catch the Loach first XD
<Light_Latias> 12granted
<Light_Latias> 12the odds of THAT are slim at best
<Glacymr> 12i'll try
<Light_Latias> 12if it says 35 pounds
<Light_Latias> 12throw it back
<Light_Latias> 12I kid you not
<Light_Latias> 12the adult Link Loach nullifies any prize you haven't gotten yet
<Light_Latias> 12Piece of Heart and Golden Scale
<Light_Latias> 12would be lost forever
<Glacymr> 12great after like 15 tries of getting the fish to take the bai
<Glacymr> 12t
<Glacymr> 12it lets go after like 2 seconds
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Armads> this screen has too much blue on it
<Espeon> 06~
<Manlyguy> I couldn't tell. lol
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Manlyguy> Now I feel like playing OoT. Last time I touched it was...
<Manlyguy> 6 years ago. Damn.
<Light_Latias> 12XD
*Light_Latias 12also has that effect on people :3
<NightSeas> 12!Glacymr
*Glacymr now belongs to NightSeas for 6 minutes and has to fly NightSeas around until then
<Manlyguy> I never understood the point of these scripts. lol
<NightSeas> 12:3
<Glacymr> 12i give up
<Glacymr> 12-.-
<Manlyguy> I used to spend hours and hours just riding on Epona shooting ghosts with arrows. So much fun.
<Light_Latias> 12lol
<Glacymr> 12this is why i don't try getting 100% of the upgrades in LoZ it's usually 50 times harder than the story itself
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<Glacymr> 12kk
<Light_Latias> 12kay
<Light_Latias> 12 3DS already on red D:
<Glacymr> 12low battery power i know
<Glacymr> 12best part is that it's still low battery life when you turn 3D off and turn wireless off
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Light_Latias> 12and sound
<Light_Latias> 12also .-.
<Light_Latias> 12I glitched it earlier
<Light_Latias> 12made a block go into another one
<Light_Latias> 12the graphics went spazzy
<Light_Latias> 12ohhhh EVILNESS
<Luna> too much blue
<Luna> so here's some black
<Light_Latias> 12making me go in as an adult, only to do 2 trhings and force me to go back as a child for about 20sec only to make me become an adult AGAIN to finish it D:
<Manlyguy> The Spirit Temple is the most boring, imo. Cause of that very reason.
*Light_Latias 12disagrees
<Light_Latias> 12in the original OoT
<Light_Latias> 12it's only child, then adult
<Light_Latias> 12none of MQ's repeating
<Light_Latias> 12the worst was Shadow Temple imo
<Light_Latias> 12the theme bugs me
<Manlyguy> Lol, I loved that level. xD
<Light_Latias> 12tho the boss is <3
<Manlyguy> Different tastes.
<Light_Latias> 12Bongo Bongo is
<Light_Latias> 12WTF
<Light_Latias> 12but
<Light_Latias> 12GIANT DRUM ARENA
<Light_Latias> 12is <3
*Light_Latias 12shudders
<Light_Latias> 12the whole spine thing scarred me .-.
<Manlyguy> The sad part is the fact you can kill him in less than two minutes.
<Light_Latias> 12try under 30sec :P
<Manlyguy> I would if you were able to replay bosses like in Majora's Mask. ):
<Light_Latias> 12Phantom Ganon, Barinade, Volvagia, and Twinrova can't be beaten under 1min
<Light_Latias> 12you can ;3
<Light_Latias> 12in OoT 3D
<Light_Latias> 12boss gauntlet <3
<Manlyguy> I'm talking N64. lol
<Light_Latias> 12either as individuals
<Light_Latias> 12or all of them
<Light_Latias> 12which has nothing on its 3DS remake :3
<Light_Latias> 12OoT 3D will descend from the heavens and lead us to the promised land
<Manlyguy> I'd expect it to be better, lol, or else it wouldn't have sold.
*Light_Latias 12hides
<Light_Latias> 12Manly
<Light_Latias> 12have you tried Master Quest?
<Manlyguy> A looooooong time ago on the GC.
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Light_Latias> 12difficult or no?
<Manlyguy> But it was around the time Melee came out, so I didn't give it any attention.
<Manlyguy> I wish I can answer that question. xD
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<Light_Latias> 12it was SO challenging

<Light_Latias> 12OoT 3D MQ

<Chimera> 04I once beat the block game
<Chimera> 04twice

<Dman> I got L4D 1+2 for only £7 (yup, UK) (Yup, didn't have L4d yet lol)
<TGPfluttershy> and in PC years, that's about 30 years.
<Dman> My pc is a laptop and it sorta fails at gaming, but eh
<Chimera> 04heh
<Dman> yea you can't upgrade macs : /
<Elky> well, you can put in a bit of ram, but yeah
<TGPfluttershy> I can barely run Civ5

<Aponymous> Can't wait 'till he starts hitting on Mika.
<Dman> Razyn, in UK the law is till 16 then you can do further leading up to university. we have colleges but they are for follow ups to jobs after 16, rather than further education to uni, so college < further education basically : P
<TGPfluttershy> Bucked it.
<Dman> uk studying in a nutshell
<Ghosties> 4Just think from Mika's POV right now; she's waiting for this guy to say something, and he's probably just staring blankly at her
<Dman> Elky is British right?
<Ghosties> 4How creepy...
<TGPfluttershy> Dat spinning icon

<Aponymous> Take your time man.
<DesSur> So...
<TGPfluttershy> I once had an idea to write a crossover
<PeanutButterDimond> Okie Dokie Loki! Takr your time.
<Incral> I could listen to this bass for hours.
<TGPfluttershy> I have no muzzle, and I must scream
<DesSur> That woman looks very occupied.
<PeanutButterDimond> *take
<Dman> lul
<Elky> it's okay, our brain is only slowly dissolved by that music...
<Aponymous> That sounds AWESOME.
<TGPfluttershy> I love this story
<DesSur> WE BUILT THIS CITY
<DesSur> WE BUILT THIS CITY
<ChaoMagma> 4speaking of doodle
<DesSur> WE BUILT THIS CITY UNDER ROCK N' ROLL
<Dman> so awesome face on the guy in the centre on the poster
<ChaoMagma> 4i'm gonna start practicing my drawing soon
<TGPfluttershy> He's got a metal cheek
<ChaoMagma> 4i really want to get better at it :3
<Ghosties> 4I'm calling it right now: The Lone Wanderer's dad, James, is Twilight Sparkle in the Pony version of Fallout 3
<Elky> oh yeah, that calm determination...
<Elky> wut
<Dman> I need to be revising before tomorrow D:
<Ghosties> 4Of course, this would mean that the father died instead
<Razyn> TGBF what the hay does BFGJ mean?
<Ghosties> 4And Twilight is the mom
<TGPfluttershy> Buck For Great Justice
<Dman> big friendly girl ... johnson
<Elky> big fuckin grenade launcher
<Aponymous> That makes almost TOO much sense.
<Dman> AH
<TGPfluttershy> Johnson!
<Razyn> Ah. Awesome
<TGPfluttershy> Johnson!
<DesSur> CAVE.
<Ghosties> 4BFG in Doom was Big Fucking Gun
<Elky> which is why I assumed it was similar...
<Dman> oh old johnson, is the one I was thinking of actually, one from a talking cat with subs video, but I have completed portal 2
<Dman> @Ghosties, I love the devs for putting that in : D
<TGPfluttershy> Big Fucking Gun....
<TGPfluttershy> The memories...
<Quanyails> 7Have fun, Chao. :3
<TGPfluttershy> BFG>>>>>>>>>>Fallout3's MARV
<ChaoMagma> 4thanks
<TGPfluttershy> BFG>>>>>>>FNV's Tesla cannon
<Dman> >hasn't played fallout. >ever. : (
<Razyn> I only have memories of the RYNO...
<Aponymous> I never got the BFG in DOOM, then again I was like 6 when it came out iirc.
<Dman> OFC > BFG
<DesSur> So.
<Razyn> Buttons
<Ghosties> 4OFC?
<Dman> (Orbital Magic Cannon)
<DesSur> I played DOOM when I was 4. I never moved AT ALL.
*TGPfluttershy joins Mika
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<DesSur> I was too afraid to shoot anything.
<Dman> : )
<Dman> Dessur - I was shitscared of metroid prime hunters when it first came out
<Dman> first game I actually fully immersted myself into, and yea...
<Razyn> TGPF how do you do that pink text thingy?
<DesSur> Dman: I've never played Metroid, except for Zero, which I'm playing at the moment.
<Dumori> /me
<Elky> razyn /me
<Dman> good man, zero's a great example of metroid
<Razyn> Test/me
<Razyn> ?
<Aponymous> I've played every Metroid aside from Prime 2, Other M and Hunters.
<ChaoMagma> 4although right now i'm just tcging
<Dman> although, thinkking about it, metroid 2 has a very unique taste, like Majora's Mask, and metroid primes are 3d...hmm, there's not really a bad metrod game is there?
*Razyn Test
<TGPfluttershy> All about Super Metroid.
<Dman> well, pinball and other m are not as good as the rest
*Razyn POWERTHRUST
<Dman> TGPFluttershy, Prime no. 1
<DesSur> Dman: Metroid Pinball?
<Dman> the rain on your visor with the choir music while staring at ruins
<Aponymous> There was a pinball game?
<Aurora> 6GOD
<TGPfluttershy> Dman, when it comes to Metroid games as a whole, they're equal
<Aurora> 6I hate biting my lip
<Aurora> 6it swells, so I KEEP biting it
<Dman> @dessur, a DS game one of my bros IRL has. it isn't great.
<TGPfluttershy> Super Metroid, probably one of the best 2D games you'll ever play
<Razyn> I can play Fusion/Zero Mission over and over and over
<Dman> Yea man, tgpfluttershy, they are
<Dman> true dat
<ChaoMagma> 4LAWL
<TGPfluttershy> And then along came SOTN
<DesSur> Quick odd question: Can I advertise for BronyState?
<SirSprinkles> 6Depends.
<Dman> I know i know pirating is bad hurr durr, but I have both zero mission and fusion, and I'd just like to say that wearing headphones while playing these games on tv from my wii (with my snes remote from clubnintendo) feels epic
<DesSur> It's a ten-second advert on my YouTube, SirSprinkles.
<Dman> (i have both on gba already is what i meant)
<SirSprinkles> 6Sending you a PM, Des.
<DesSur> Thanks. I'll follow up.
<TGPfluttershy> I'm waiting for some GBA games on the 3DS
<TGPfluttershy> bound to happen, sooner or later.
<Aponymous> I wanna get a 3DS, I still have the fat old DS.
<SirSprinkles> 6Des... *points to PM at the top of the chat*
<Dman> I hope they do gba for 3ds, but i dont know if they will
<Dman> and i hope they do GC games for WiiU
<TGPfluttershy> That's gonna be tough, but possible
<TGPfluttershy> As long as they put enough space in it AND give us the option to expand it.
<Dman> also, hanging out on 4chan's /v/, and after wiiu announced on livestream, this
<Dman> http://deltax20a.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/316319124.jpg
<Dman> In 10 seconds flat. that's how long it took for someone to make this
<Aponymous> lol
<Elky> /v/
<Elky> oooookay
<DesSur> SirSprinkles: Followed-up. Had to do something. Sorry.
<Dman> I rarely go on 4chan anymore. but /v/ for E3 is godtier in terms of lolcontent
<TGPfluttershy> Picture broken!
<Dman> : /
<TGPfluttershy> :(
<Dman> It's the new wiiu remote, and it reads
<Dman> 'Wii U Mad?' with a trollface on it
<Elky> I'm nowhere but /sci/, they get trolled the easiest
<Dman> yup
<Dman> i still enjoy going on the cooking board occasionally for some threads that may post pics of instantmeals. they're fun to make.
<NewDCD> 9God

<Dman> xy male ^^
<Hipster_Brony> 8 2 different people
<DrDoom> NewDCD Brofist hea
<Elky> It's yourself!
<Dumori> Dman you use the emzymes to demerin the blood type IIRC
<Elky> or maybe not
<NewDCD> 9they're probably referring to the elements that determine blood type. There are "anti-blood type" enzymes in the bloodstream
<Dman> I see
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://i.imgur.com/YcTa7.jpg
<NewDCD> 9for example, if you have Blood Type A
<SilverMane> Okay, I admit it, it was me. I was hungry, and he had chinese! Still hungry, though.
<NewDCD> 9you have Anti-B type Enzymes
<NewDCD> 9if B, Anti A
<NewDCD> 9if you are AB, none
<Dman> I'm only 17, but i plan to become a med student, and am on my way to rite now. That was interesting : )

<DrDoom> Durr I meant O+
<Elky> dammit silver, what're we gonna do if one of us has to give blood to the other?
<Hipster_Brony> 8>mfw im too much of a candy vag to donate blood
<Tyranico> O+ is the most common type
<Dman> do ponies have bloodtypes?
<DrDoom> Hipster, you're not a pussy
<Dman> or can a unicorn donate blood to an earht pony?
<ValtheJean> Pinkie's Bloodtype is sugar
<DrDoom> Just get friends to help you out.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Dman: syrup type
<SilverMane> Elky, we're going to kidnap RainBroDash and make him do it
<Elky> I kinda like donating blood
<Dman> Lol!
<DesSur> Pony Blood Types: Hay or Nay.
<Elky> oh that would work silver
<SilverMane> I passed out after donating blood, they raised my head too fast
<Razyn> Wait no, I don't have O. Stupid. I have RH or something like that. I think.

<eXAKR> Yes
<Aponymous> Put some leverage on it?
<Dman> guys prepare for some legendary copypasta
<Armads> that is what you get
<HaveLeverageWillTravel> Senor Rodriguez's voice sounds kinda familiar... can't quite place it, though
<Dman> 'Due to extensive research done by the Fourchon University of Science, diamond has been confirmed as the the hardest metal known the man. The research is as follows. Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed. '
<Armads> when you spam scripts
<Dman> ' They then built a wall out of diamond and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an out into the wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a diamond car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours.'
<Armads> you get paired with Armads.
<Armads> *thunderclap*
<Dman> ' They rammed a wall of metal into a 400 mile per hour made of diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth's orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards midwestern Prussia at 400 billion miles per hour. '
<Armads> *horror movie music*
<Dman> ' They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused two wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with two buildings in downtown New York. '
<Razyn> Thank you, silvermane. I enjoy reading quite a bit.
<Dman> # They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive. Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall traveling at miles, and the result proved without a doubt that diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not just the hardest metal known the man.#

<Chimera> 04How long was OoT3D in development you think?
<Glacymr> 129001 years
<Chimera> 04I need a serious answer
<Light_Latias> 12umm
<drf|laptop> 03why does it matter
<drf|laptop> 03"a long time"
<Light_Latias> 12since b4 the 3DS's release
<NightSeas> 12More then likely since the release of OoT DS, since it takes that long to make a remake like that
<Light_Latias> 12like
<Light_Latias> 12NightSeas
<Light_Latias> 12it's like a remake of 2 games +
<Light_Latias> 12so we're talking a couple yearsd
<Light_Latias> 12-d
<NightSeas> 12yeah
<NightSeas> 12However, it takes such a long time to make a game, that they more then likely started working on it right after the last remake.
<eXAKR> !say !defective
<junh1024-XD> !defective
<eXAKR> Uhhhh... Blam! Blam blam blam! I'm not defective!
<NightSeas> 12As funny as it sounds, they would have been working on the 3DS since after the making of the DSi
<Light_Latias> 12inb4 started after they made the Virtual Boy :B
*Light_Latias 12hides
<eXAKR> 3DS is a failure

<JetTheLatios> ;_;
<Glacymr> 12now if you excuse me i'm going to watch guys microwave a propane tank
<NightSeas> 12Eh, nevermind drf. And I think you mean million.
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03there are 7 billion people on the planet
<drf|laptop> 033.5 million is like a tiny number in comparison
<NightSeas> 12That's 3.5 million in just a few months
<NightSeas> 12And that's very good considering it's over $250
<drf|laptop> 03how many original DSes sold?
<NightSeas> 12derp
<NightSeas> 12144.59 million units
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 033.7 is a very small percent of that :P
<NightSeas> 12But like I said, in just a few months xD
<drf|laptop> 03still
<drf|laptop> 03you made it sound like 3.7 was this big number
<drf|laptop> 03it's big comapred to 100 but it's not that big compared to most other video game system sales
<NightSeas> 12Yeah, it will take a price change for it to get there
<NightSeas> 12Which always happens
<NightSeas> 12And since it can play DS games, anyone that wants a new DS will end up buying a 3DS
*drf|laptop sighs
<drf|laptop> 03the DS upscaling on 3DS is horrible
<drf|laptop> 03it COULD be a lot better
<HyperMetalLugia> I know x.x
<HyperMetalLugia> fuzz everywhere
<NightSeas> 12HML, that's your bad eye sight
*NightSeas runs
<drf|laptop> 03and mine?
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<HyperMetalLugia> Silly Nightseas
<drf|laptop> 03look up any user review, most people say it's terrible
<NightSeas> 12JK
<drf|laptop> 03the system itself is alright but has a lot of major annoyances
<NightSeas> 12Just as many say it's awesome
<drf|laptop> 03no, WI mean the upscaling part specifically
<drf|laptop> 03I haven't seen a single review that said they like the way standard DS games look on the 3DS
<NightSeas> 12That's because they don’t know to turn off the 3D when playing an old DS game
<drf|laptop> 03...
<drf|laptop> 03implying that actually makes a differen*ce
<drf|laptop> 03the 3D light turns off meaning there IS no 3D
<HyperMetalLugia> NS is derping
<NightSeas> 12yep
<HyperMetalLugia> I actually refuse to play DS games on my 3DS
<HyperMetalLugia> And I only have 1 3DS game for now
<drf|laptop> 03same

<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> She is always watching on us
<NightSeas> 12Indeed
<NightSeas> 12Anyways, I have a 3DS, and the old DS games look just as good on it to me.
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe YOU need glasses?
*HyperMetalLugia runs
<HyperMetalLugia> And lol, it seems I've been keeping the 3D on the 3DS on max for around 80-90% of the time
<NightSeas> 12Because the screen is actually better and has smaller pixels then the DSi screen
<NightSeas> 12than*
<HyperMetalLugia> Everyone should just get a DsiXL if they want to play DS games
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 EW DSiXL
<NightSeas> 12derp
<NightSeas> 12I had one
<NightSeas> 12Then I sold one
<HyperMetalLugia> So did I
<HyperMetalLugia> My one got stolen ;.;
<HyperMetalLugia> Which is why I got the 3DS
<HyperMetalLugia> Brb
<drf|laptop> 03it got stolen?
<NightSeas> 12I also have a phat DS that I kept
<JetTheLatios> Good night guys :D

<Quanyails> 7Well, if anyone's abound, I've had another pseudo-lucid dream.
<Quanyails> 7This time involving stalking Robin Atkin Downes. O__o
<Quanyails> 7Heya, lightumbreon.
<lightumbreon> 06heya Quan
<Quanyails> 7Came just in time to hear about a pseudo-lucid dream I had about stalking Robin Atkin Downes. >>
<lightumbreon> 06O.o
<Quanyails> 7For some reason, I found R.A.D. in a mall. I think he was part of some sort of treasure-hunt-esque activity there, which ended with slingshots.
<Quanyails> 7But that's a digression.
<lightumbreon> 06mmhhmm
<Quanyails> 7I met him, asked him some stuff, and suddenly, a group of fangirls appeared.
<Quanyails> 7I asked him the generic interview-y stuff, and asked him to voice some lines as TF2's Medic. O_o
<Quanyails> 7He did so, and then he asked to leave.
<Quanyails> 7He left, but then I remembered that there was one question (in real life) everyone was asking him and he never responded to: Did Valve ask him to voice more lines in-game?
<Quanyails> 7By this time, he was walking along some rural dirt patch.
<Quanyails> 7path*
<lightumbreon> 06hm...
<Quanyails> 7So I dream-flew (dunno exactly, it happens in my dreams a lot) over to him.
<Quanyails> 7It took me a while to get to him. O3o
<Quanyails> 7So, I asked my question, and he responded, "Well, there are those cut-out lines from Meet the Medic..." (Or something to that regard.)
<Quanyails> 7I still was curious about what he was doing, so I continued to follow. While he was amiable at first, R.A.D. got increasingly annoyed.
<Quanyails> 7I forget what happens after.
<Quanyails> 7Gah, gotta go.

<MrPoniator> Haven't seen him say anything
<Polarfire> Oh.
<Polarfire> Anything good on ponychan XD
<MrPoniator> Some pretty random stuff on /chat/, as usual

<Polarfire> Anything else you wanna talk about? XD
<MrPoniator> Eh, I don't have much on my mind right now :P

<MrPoniator> Some generic corn flakes or something?

<MrPoniator> Ah, alrighty then

<Damos> hey everyone
<lightlugia> 06heya Damos
<nickstr> I got Pokemon Heroes on DVD yesterday and even though its a brand new release what I ended up with was the very last copy in stock at the local Target
<Damos> Nice
<nickstr> that might say something
<Damos> I did the same thing too
<Damos> although I got two movies in one cd
<nickstr> ugh
<Damos> it was in a sale pile
<nickstr> that stupid combo pack with Destiny Deoxys
<nickstr> EWW ADVANCED GENERATION!
<Damos> how dare they put a pokemon movie in a sale pile
<nickstr> because it did not sell
<Damos> I got the Voice of the forest and Heros together
<nickstr> most US viewers tend to focus on the past or only know about it
<Damos> I do both
<Damos> the past and the future
<nickstr> I hate the present and future
<nickstr> only focusing on the past
<Damos> I'm equal
<Damos> I like all
<Damos> but with pokemon
<Damos> and other anime
<nickstr> Dawn I found annoying and boring
<Damos> how?
<nickstr> May I found to be just plain annoying
<nickstr> bland personality
<nickstr> generic
<Damos> O.o
<nickstr> plus Ash not getting any better and still making the same mistakes over and over
<Damos> Thats whats fun about him
<nickstr> not realy
<nickstr> its repetitive
<nickstr> Ash learns something then forgets it quickly
<Damos> you can critizise it
<Damos> thats why its fun
<nickstr> nope
<nickstr> thats why its repetitive
<nickstr> and annoying
<nickstr> I got sick of Ash not long after I started watching
<Damos> without that there wouldn't be any good rps and fanfictions
<nickstr> not really
<nickstr> you can have fan fiction without Ash being a dumb*censored*
<Damos> I read tons without Ash being dumb
<Damos> but the ones I do read are hilarious
<Damos> the way the author wrote it
<nickstr> Brock I got annoyed with too
<nickstr> his "gag" got old fast
<nickstr> as did Ash being a moron
<Damos> remember the episode when Misty was separated from Ash and Brock and only had That Marril and Pikachu with her?
<nickstr> yes
<Damos> When that woman was running down the cliff I was thinking. "MAN HOW DOES SHE RUN IN THOSE HEALS.?! Shes tougher than she looks
<Damos> XD

<Lakorv> I see..

<Hawkie> 07I'm usually quiet, doesn't mean I'm upset or bored. I forgot to mention as I was leaving, but I did mention to Xai
<Hawkie> 07Because I remembered that my silence has been taken for arrogance before and I don't want that ^^
