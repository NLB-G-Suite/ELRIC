<DaringDude> Wait werent we supposed to play today or something?
<Tovler> Wait. I was a Hamtaro fan when I was in High School. Coming out as a brony won't surprise my folks.
<DaringDude> or did we mis that
<SunderlandPony89> DaringDude: Even though it'll never be as good as Minecraft on the PC

<Midnight_Tempest> MahBoi777: probably is better ways, but this is why i would be a bad father... kid does something stupid, beating... kid steals shit, beatings... kid talks back, beatings... respect is earned, not given and sometimes you have to also just take it by force
<Reikim> Shizuka: But what about us who can't get hats :<
*kirzstryfe noms on Cobellanez
<Gunthler> Cobellanez:
<DaringDude> Cobellanez: Ping!

<Reikim> Shizuka demands it! Coballanez: PING
<phobos2390> SunderlandPony: one which has a rule where I can't play M rated games.
<Gunthler> Cobellanez: PONIES!!!
<The_FaN_Scout> when i play portall 2 online with my friend, i turn on sv_cheats 1 and spawn cubes and make the portals bigger.
<kenne> id ping if i was in a mood to bug the hell out of someone
<Marx> I'm just a little emotional at the moment.
<Shizuka> 13wait you can make portals bigger?
<DaringDude> phobos2390: lol how old are you?
<SunderlandPony89> DaringDude: Damn man that's horridly slow. My internet is at least fast (although it cuts out due to bad wiring)
<The_FaN_Scout> Ja.
<kenne> but im kind of a solemn mood now
<DaringDude> not being personal or anythin
<Cobellanez> :c
<Shizuka> 13thought you could just disable non-portal walls
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:3
<The_FaN_Scout> with a command.
<phobos2390> DaringDude: 17...
<DaringDude> ....

<Reikim> LunaTheBeloved: It's like...Power Rangers! If it was more hilariously awful than it already was!
<The_FaN_Scout> but the code starts with portal2_
<kirzstryfe> 1,3$20
<DaringDude> kenne: in like a spawner or did u hav a skele kill a creeper?
<Reikim> Man, I need to get L4D2.
<phobos2390> DaringDude: The family rule is that I can't play them until my younger sister is 17 years of age. She's 8 right now...
<DaringDude> HA
<kenne> DaringDude: in a dungeon with a spawner and loot crates
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: That's some fucked up logic right there
<DaringDude> im sorry though
<The_FaN_Scout> why cant i find hats? ;n; i want a stout shako.
<DaringDude> kenne noice which one u get?
<Reikim> phobos2390: Well. You have moving out to look forward to, then.
<kenne> DaringDude: also now i have a diamond sword and all the lapiz lazuli i need to make light blue wool and magenta wool that ill need
<DaringDude> all da wool
<phobos2390> SunderlandPony89: I think the reasoning is that she will try to watch what I am doing and will be exposed.
<TheGir979> LYRA, Y U NO GET OFF THE SCREEN?!
*Reikim laments his lack of hat in TF2
<DaringDude> kenne is that the same world i was building dat wood platform in

<The_FaN_Scout> spam it
<The_FaN_Scout> now
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: It's still fucked up. Just dont have her in the room when you're playing the game, problem solved. Her seeing one image isn't gonna hurt her into a killer (and it wouldn't anyway)
<DaringDude> lol dis GLaDOS
<The_FaN_Scout> aww
<Reikim> Edgeless Safety Cube. Genius.
<kenne> DaringDude: i think so, like where you had a half wooden house with a stone well and some farmland?

<The_FaN_Scout> WAIT, I'VE BURNED MYSELF WITH MELTED PLASTIC THATS LIKE GOO
<kenne> DaringDude: thats a good way to describe it, i feel like theres death creeping behind me at every turn
<TheGir979> WTF is Portal 2 rated?
<Reikim> She forgot "Killed by Shizuka subjecting us to intense quantities of d'awww".
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: You should bring that point up with your folks if you haven't already
<RAWRity> http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/photoshop/7/3/0/129730_slide.jpg?v=1

<The_FaN_Scout> i'm back, what did i miss?
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: I'm guessing SSBB isn't allowed?
<TheGir979> ?
<TheGir979> oh'
<SunderlandPony89> Super Smash Brothers Brawl
<MahBoi777> SSBB isn't bad
<DaringDude> Reikim: ha i know that feel just tormented soil all day and no one can fuck with u
<TheGir979> Yeah I know
<Barbetos> phobos2390 can't be all that bad since you seem to have a computer and access to a chat room like this as well as being able to get away with being a brony, which I am assuming they don't know of course.
<DaringDude> not with spell shield nd all
<phobos2390> SunderlandPony89: I asked my dad and he said that he didn't want T rated games in the house before my 8 year old sister turns 13.
<SunderlandPony89> MahBoi777: But it's rated T! That's to mature!
<Reikim> DaringDude: No other champion lanes mid harder. Period.
*Tovler checks to see if Battleship is failing on Rottentomatoes.
<phobos2390> Barbetos: They know about me being a brony.
<LunaTheBeloved> So how is everypony?
<MahBoi777> SunderlandPony89: NO M is mature!:D
<Barbetos> See? Ain't so bad
<DaringDude> i dunno i got a mean mid lane evelyn
<EonMastor> has anyone seen the secret level in Diablo 3 yet?
<DaringDude> no
<Glacymr> stir fry
<Reikim> I am JUST DANDY. I think.
<DaringDude> is it pony related?
<Aurora> hmm
<Barbetos> ^
<Champion_of_Harmony> does it have ponys?
<phobos2390> Barbetos: What's interesting is that I see worse things on my computer than I see in my games.
<Reikim> I'm also a year closer to dying, numerically.
<EonMastor> maybe >.>
<Aurora> I should do laundry tonight
<Aurora> brb
<LunaTheBeloved> Happy B-Day
<Ingwaz> Barbetos: having to "get away" with being a brony is stupid. I understand the fear of rejection from your parents. I was wondering what my parents would think. But actually being not allowed to watch it is stupid
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: At least you have ponies. I, myself, can't imagine not being able to play my T and M rated games
*LunaTheBeloved pulls out a cake
<TheGir979> 0_0

<LunaTheBeloved> Oh Cello Saxy
<DaringDude> ^
<TheGir979> 0_o
<Reikim> phobos2390: Ha, I was in the same situation. Mostly because I watched all my anime online, and my parents never bothered to check exactly what...Evangelion robbed my innocence at an early age.
<SunderlandPony89> Lucky bastard ;)

*Reikim begins baking more cakes
<DaringDude> i play halo reach like a baws
<phobos2390> SunderlandPony89: Yeah...I have managed to download the Resident Evil Revelations and Metal Gear 3d Demos. Two days later my parents found out and my dad freaked out and deleted them.
<Champion_of_Harmony> Indeed and wheneve my bros get pissy I just take my bat and said. "What did you say about fluttershy?"
<MahBoi777> ^
<SunderlandPony89> DaringDude: I play Impostors like a baws :D
<Barbetos> Ingwaz Eh. Not so much of being afraid of being a brony, I would be more worried about over active imaginations of parents who are over protective and see the brony culture in a peculiar way.
<DaringDude> Ha dat imposters :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yes, I would
*Reikim serves cake to the entire chatroom.

<Reikim> otakon: Here, have some cake.
<Tovler> Pretend to be hyper obsessed with ponies. They'll want you to play M-rated demos like a man.
<Ingwaz> Barbetos: thats part of what i was talking about. people really just need to get their heads out of their flanks sometimes and just look at things from an objective perspective
<otakon> but
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: At the very least, you should be able to play SOME computer games. Just keep your siblings off the computer.
<kenne> i just noticd that i had completely zoned out
<otakon> it's a LIE!
<otakon> also, hiya SaxyPretender

<Champion_of_Harmony> anyway it was an analogy about cutains. What the author ment and what your english teacher thinks.
<HyperMetalLugia> Pretty fun
<ThisgirlLovesbronies> It's adorkable LOL!

<HyperMetalLugia> naah
<HyperMetalLugia> too difficult
<Glacymr> no thx
<DitzyHooves> did u get it?
<phobos2390> SunderlandPony89: Anyway...It's only on occasion that I wish that I could play more mature games, but other than those few times I haven't really felt excessively restricted. And besides, my friend also has a similar restriction on M rated games (not T rated games though)
<TheMaster> because lyra was trying to become a human and accidently entered into the g1 dimension
<ThisgirlLovesbronies> gtg bye
<HyperMetalLugia> we need a kalleria server
<Glacymr> would have been awesome if you downloaded type wild as well

<phobos2390> SunderlandPony89: We just live in different households then.
<SunderlandPony89> phobos2390: We truely do :P
<TheMaster> I usually play boring strategy games. They tend to not be high on the 'mature' side. They sure are complicated though.
<flutter_spin> Why must I have 9/10 of my story be a mystery buildup and then 1/10 be epic reveal battle tumble
<MahBoi777> banning works lol
<TheMaster> Also best mature game is Plane Scape Torment.

<SayWhat> Be right back, where's my lighter

<Tovler> Is it a Luna Moth?
<drfsupercenter> 03why would you WANT a Wii UI
<drfsupercenter> 03at all
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<MahBoi777> poor moth
<phobos2390> panda: I also talked about how I interpreted the events in relation to the two of us.
<Chimera> I don't see it like thay
<Chimera> That
<BlueFlare> Exactly
<Chimera> Wii OS is built for games specifically
<BlueFlare> you wouldn't XD
<TheMaster> dale was the best thing in the show
<panda> phobos2390, did you forefully make out with her face?
<Kandarihu> Wierd
<junh1024-XD> the reason you buy a mac is to run OSX
<DeadlyPony3> Dale is a robot from the futurepast
<Chimera> And its hardware is different from.a PCs (and a lot worse)
<Pinkies4thWallXbox> Bill Nye!
<DeadlyPony3> BIitch!
<phobos2390> panda: What? No! I've never kissed a girl in my life!
<drfsupercenter> 03<junh1024-XD> the reason you buy a mac is to run OSX <- or because it's shiny and you assume that makes it better? :P
<BlueFlare> and Mac OS is built for Macs specifically
<Chimera> Whereas a PC is ultipurpose with varying hardware
<junh1024-XD> if you're using it for other OS most of the time you're defeating the purpose - go buy a PC instead
<DeadlyPony3> o_
<CupcakeWarrior> Suuuuuure
<panda> phobos2390: dont... forsome reason it worked for me lol XD
<drfsupercenter> 03<BlueFlare> [22:22] <HyperMetalLugia> Yet you can't legally install Mac OSX on anything other than a Mac <-- why would you want to? XD <- to prove to Apple fanboys that it's possible?
<drfsupercenter> 03and well
<TheMaster> its not a race, you'll make it in your own time.
<Chimera> Drf hahaha
<phobos2390> panda: don't kiss a girl?
<drfsupercenter> 03the only reason OSX appears to be more stable than Windows is because it's only built for the incredibly limited hardware that Apple approves
<Sylandest> this version of bobby is so disturbing...yet so hilarious
<DeadlyPony3> Beeaautiful
<Chimera> And again iOS dev
<CupcakeWarrior> phobos2390: Kiss guys?
<Pinkies4thWallXbox> O}_{O
<emangamer> XD
<DeadlyPony3> Hey MAH BOI
<drfsupercenter> 03try installing OSX on anything else and you'll have even more issues :P
<Chimera> Make a GOOD app :p

<drfsupercenter> 03there's just too many variables
<DeadlyPony3> Hey Mahboi777

<Aurora> that's not all
<junh1024-XD> you mean the widgets at the top right?
<Aurora> to by presing the power button, it gave the option to power down

<Sylandest> howdy, MahBoi777!
<junh1024-XD> the widgets at the top right are controlled by systemUIserver iirc

<twilight_sprinkler> i dont drink, coffee, i wonder if it would help, altho ill need it more in the morning. i actually feel decent now, ill feel like hell in the morning

<junh1024-XD> and then anything follows.

<TheHoodyNinja> Oh, it seems i dropped my hat, now, WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT!
<Eddmario> I tried my hoof at fanfic writing. Couldn't come up with anything for the second chapter. The chapters afterwards I had an idea for what I was gonna include, but that damn second chapter was hard
<hen3ry> blocks are common in any writing.
<Eddmario> Seriously, is someone talking? Because I can't here them over the game
<Lightning_Zephyr> chat people probly can't hear story but i can kinda.
<TheHoodyNinja> From the rooms and walls i see, this reminds me of the Great Deku tree
<Shane377> Eddmario: yes
<hen3ry> I can hear mumbling in background
<Eddmario> I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going...

<TheHoodyNinja> Oh X-box, you silly game, the volume is still the same
<Kandarihu> Man, there needs to be a FiM Maniazone for Trackmania, with MLP themed horns and car skins.
<TheHoodyNinja> ^
<MahBoi777> the settings do nothing!
<Lightning_Zephyr> put it to 3 or something lower i think that would be a good volume.
<Shane377> Lightning_Zephyr: its on 3
<Lightning_Zephyr> oh
<Shane377> ikr
<hen3ry> the setting is useless. or counter-productive. Not sure.
<TheHoodyNinja> SuperBrony64: If you wish to be quiet, that is your choice, but i cannot hear your manly voice
<Kandarihu> There are a LOT of voice clips that would make funny Horn sounds.
<Shane377> xbox game setting is worst setting

<DaringDude> inb4 pirates
<DaringDude> not troll man
<MahBoi777> yar har fiddledy dee
<TheRandomkid321> Trololo
<Aurora> 6most animations are done on 2s
<Kipkat07_Mare> DaringDude: You have some serious 1337 h4x because you know all this shit. You are a motherfucking wizard.
<Aurora> 6as in, each single frame is held twice
<TheHoodyNinja> Imma ninja, imma hoody ninja
<DaringDude> XD
<DaringDude> inb4 yeah
<BlueFlare> 02yeah
<Aurora> 6a single frame /is/ recognizable by the eye, but by doubling it, it is much more readable without much notice
<DaringDude> wait
<TheRandomkid321> Daringdude I knwo it all too. I just dotn boast
<MahBoi777> TheHoodyNinja is best hooded ninja
<Aurora> 6anime is notorious for 1s, which is why it's so smooth, but it's kind of uncanny at times
<DaringDude> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03that's just wasting filesize though, if it's the exact same frame, then just lower the framerate
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<TheHoodyNinja> MahBoi777: yes I is
<Kipkat07_Mare> and yes, I did just use 1337 speak
<TheRealSlimShady> imma shady im da real slim shady yes im the real slim shady
<TheRandomkid321> i second that MahBoi
<MahBoi777> xD
<Aurora> 6I'm not too knowledgeable on the exact reason
<DaringDude> captain planet
<TheHoodyNinja> TheRealSlimShady: You just ruined that so bad
<Kipkat07_Mare> TheRealSlimShady: orly?
<Aurora> 6but animating 24fps is advisable as opposed to 12
<Shane377> lol
<Aurora> 6especially when scenes call for 1s
<TheHoodyNinja> who was that?
<Aurora> 6you can easily switch between 1s and 2s when animating in 24fps
<DaringDude> inb4 nyan
*Shane377 shrugs
<BlueFlare> 02well, you spend twice as much time on 1s vs 2s
<TheRandomkid321> Dung
<MahBoi777> the world may never know
<TheRandomkid321> Aw
*Kipkat07_Mare nyans
<TheRandomkid321> nyanyanyanaynaaya
<Aurora> 6in 12fps, you're essentially animating in 1s only
*TheHoodyNinja beats Shane377 with a bucket until he tells me who it was
<BlueFlare> 02so it's worth the waste in file size
*Kipkat07_Mare whistles nyan cat
<hen3ry> great now I want a pop tart.
<TheRandomkid321> screw nyan naynaynaynayn
<MahBoi777> Bababababababaaba
<Aurora> 6which again goes back to what I said, the mind easily recognizes 2s
<DaringDude> inb4 halo
<BlueFlare> 02yeah

<Kipkat07_Mare> HALOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<TheHoodyNinja> AH WTF!

<Aurora> I'd rather be Aurora
<drfsupercenter> 03and the newest firmware won't let me install homebrew
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's useless to me

<drfsupercenter> 03LL was considering buying this off me but, she'd have to sell her slim
<Glacymr> you did say yourself the PS3 does nothing but be a dvd player right?
<Glacymr> it doesn't need homebrew to do that
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03it needs homebrew to rip SACDs
<drfsupercenter> 03and play copied games
<Glacymr> sorry

<panda> xD

<Shane377> Ghosties: DeathStar i kno something thatll cheer u up and make u laugh
<BlueFlare> 02okay, Lighty you don't own Apple XD
<Shane377> Ghosties: DeathStar http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ1dYrjuYf4&feature=related
<BlueFlare> 02So you should take everything that people say against them personally
<BlueFlare> 02shouldn't*

<Shane377> BLARUGHUGHUGH
<Lighty> 06and i dont take things against me or other personally, thats stupid
<junh1024-XD> but i've mostly migrated to VLC/mplayer* on mac because loading mkv files is quicker
*DeathStar dances on Shane377 s feet for a change of pace
<junh1024-XD> https://www.google.co.nz/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=how+to+quicktime+pro+lion
<BlueFlare> 02quicktime is bad though. And I'm someone who likes a lot of Apple's stuff :P
<Ghosties> 04Nigel Thornberry is good...
<MaidSurge> Ghosties: as long as you don't stream stuff like Guinea Pig I can take horror :D
<junh1024-XD> >MFW
<Ghosties> 04But this is better: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEdICVzB4qQ
<Shane377> DeathStar: ow my toes
<Lighty> 06i had my experiences with Quicktime too, i mostly use a combination of Winamp, iTunes and library programs
<Lighty> 06like, music library
<Aurora> 6quicktime tends to be convienient for me with animation
<DeathStar> Shane377: oh sorry I'll get off
<Shane377> Ghosties: this is BAWSS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6c-Mr1Wwvg
*DeathStar dances on Shane377 s head
<Shane377> DeathStar: its fine just dont dance with heels on
<Aurora> 6it's the only reason I ever use the program
<junh1024-XD> sometimes QT is good, sometimes it's bad
<DeathStar> Shane377: ok :)
<Jim> Shane377: If I had a dollar for every pixle in that video, I would have one dollar
<Aurora> 6Lion's setup with quicktime involves it keeping every video file open until you personally close it
<Shane377> lol Jim
<BlueFlare> 02on Windows QT is always bad
<Aurora> 6whereas before if I just closed the program, they'd all be closed
<Aurora> 6now if I open quicktime, they're still there until I close them manually
<Aurora> 6also, the snow leopard only ran one at a time normally
<Shane377> ive i had a a millon dollars for every time DeathStar danced i would be a millonaire
<junh1024-XD> cmd-W?
<Aurora> 6but yeah, with this stupid setup of opening quicktime with all the old videos on it
<BlueFlare> 02guess I better goes to beds
<Aurora> 6it crashed finder earlier
<junh1024-XD> the typical user experience, expexially on slower computers with QT GUI, is bad
<Aurora> 6which is rather...crucial.

<Meanwhile> That was good movie until the end.
*XAX hasn't seen It
*XAX wants to watch It
<Kammerjunk> At first, I thought the secret pony level would anger a lot of people, but I haven't seen a lot of hate for it yet.
<XAX> In what? :o
<Kammerjunk> But then again, D3 was released 2 days ago.
<Ghosties> 044chan's pretty pissed about it
<Meanwhile> Guess you should start voting it for B movie XAX.
<Kammerjunk> Ghosties: Well, 4chan's pissed about pretty much everything.
<XAX> ...diablo 3 had a secret pony level?
<Meanwhile> Is there anything in existence 4chan isn't pissed about at some point?
<Ghosties> 04But a lot of their anger is justified
<Kammerjunk> Ghosties: Depends on the board.
<Ghosties> 04It's not just "Oh, 4chan is always pissed at something." Usually, they have a right to be pissed
<Meanwhile> I don't own Diablo 3 so I have no idea what you're on about.

<Kammerjunk> But yeah, I can imagine /b/ being pissed about it. What with hating ponies and everything.

<Kammerjunk> Specifically, /co/ did.
<Meanwhile> >A lot of their anger is justified.

<TheRainbowDash> Oh, just spending a bit of time here, but I have to head out for finals today.
<pony_911> how come no one name "balls"

<Meanwhile> Phase4: Grooovy.
<RaveBrony> *Weed vids'
<XAX> Phase4: Reboots. Why must you do them so frequently?
<Jim> Because you touch yourself at night
<Phase4> XAX, because windows for games (at least untill a few plans of mine start to work) and linux for everything else, and some games
<XAX> Phase4: good luck with these plans ._.
<Om> Jim: Only at night?
<Phase4> what to play... what to play...
<Kammerjunk> I hate hail.
<Jim> Minecraft?
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: That's it! I've got it! There's really just one way to find out which game is the BEST!
*Rain loves tornadoes
<TheRainbowDash> Rain: I wub, well.....not destructive types of weather.
<Om> Kammerjunk: Make them run an obstical course?
<Rain> I enjoy standing outside during tornadoes~
<Kammerjunk> You've got it!
<Phase4> Kammerjunk, hold a contest, of speed, agility and guts!
<Meanwhile> I wish there were more thunderstorms around here :I
<Kammerjunk> I like rain, but I don't like being in the rain.
<TheRainbowDash> Oh god, not this again....(covers ears):D
<Rain> I love walking in the rain~
<Kammerjunk> Raindrops keep falling on my head.
<Meanwhile> Rain in the rain. Rainception.
<Rain> :p
<Kammerjunk> But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red. Cryin's not for me.
<pony_911> its been raining 3 days in a row here
<Om> What if Rain is just rain that learned to type?
<Ghosties> 04<@Saturn> y'know, being an English major, n'all
<Ghosties> 04* @Saturn runs <-- Yeah, you better run -_-
<TheRandomkid321> My room is freezing. I dont think my fan and A/C are helping much aswell -_-
<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties: Saturn is just a decoy so that you'll feel happy.:|
<Rain> Om, you shut your mouth!
<Kammerjunk> One thing I don't like about rain is how hard it is pulling arrows out of a target in the rain.
<Phase4> tf2 or trackmania....
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, those bastards are slippery.
*Rain runs away yelling "No one must know!"
<Phase4> or choice c, audiosurf...
<Om> Rain: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4305/
<TheRainbowDash> Phase4: I'll chose audiosurd, it is cool.
<Kammerjunk> A runabout! I'll STEAL it! NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW!
<TheRainbowDash> (audiosurf)
<Phase4> audiosurf it is
<RaveBrony> Lol, Om
<TheRandomkid321> WHy does my saliva smell like pau pau crem?

<TheRainbowDash> Wait, my decision is the only decision? Ok.:D
<XAX> Phase4: Stream TF2 some time, so I can backstab you and bronystate can laug-- what?
<RaveBrony> Lol!!
<Kammerjunk> I like TF2.
<Kammerjunk> TF2 is fun.
<XAX> ^
<Om> TheRainbowDash: Why are you smelling your saliva?
<TheRainbowDash> Wait, what the hay?
<Kammerjunk> Well, why not!
<TheRandomkid321> So si Prince-Dari on the cat or just on the side bar?

*Shane377 throws Phase4 a game

<Ghosties> 04He's always here
<Ghosties> 04Always
<Rain> Ghosties, english major is better than my major
<XAX> Legitimately lol'd, phase4.
*Shane377 throws video equipment at Ghosties
<XAX> ^ why? :o
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Om> Confidence? http://buttersafe.com/2007/07/19/confidence/
<Rain> to capture a ghost on film
<Kammerjunk> I'm not a major. I'm not even in the army.
<XAX> ^ O U.
<Jim> Om: I lost
<TheRainbowDash> Ghosties: Does that mean I have to be afraid of prince-dari?:(
<Om> Jim: Are you saying you lost the game?
<Jim> Yep
<RaveBrony> ...so did i
<RaveBrony> -_-
<TheRainbowDash> Everyone has lost the game, thereis no winner to it
<RaveBrony> ^
<Ghosties> 04Yes, TheRainbowDash
<TheRainbowDash> o_o....I got to run.
<Kammerjunk> I lost the Game before it was cool.
<Jim> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScCgxuId98
<XAX> >_>
<Kammerjunk> I only like the meme ironically, really.
<Ghosties> 04As afraid as you would be of Glados
<XAX> Oh noe
<TheRainbowDash> Well, that isn't too bad.
<DeadpoolDash> always watching...like ceiling Derpy
<Rain> lets compair college majors, shall we? :3
*XAX is 15, and what is this?
*Rain was talking to the big ponies
<Kammerjunk> I like GLaDOS, really. And who wouldn't like a cynical, all-powerful AI.
<TheRandomkid321> Am... AM I high right now? http://cheezburger.com/6207166720?siteId=136#comments
<Kammerjunk> Dude, woah.
<RaveBrony> Lol??
<RaveBrony> Ive never been high, so i wudnt know :D
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Kammerjunk> I don't even smoke.
<Jim> I just don't know what went wrong
<RaveBrony> Same
<Rain> you dont need to smoke to get high
<RaveBrony> Nice pic tho :P
<Kammerjunk> I meant cigarettes.
*Rain 's favorite high is Runner's High~
<Jim> I'm high on friendship
<RaveBrony> ^
<Phase4> audiosurf realy isnt doing it for me tonight :(
<Shane377> u can get high of morphine
<Rain> duh
<RaveBrony> Im high on life.... people always say im high, when im not :D
<Rain> you can also get high off of running
<TheRainbowDash> Phase4: Oh, well....hmm, try Team Fortress 2 then.
<derpy_pony> https://images.4channel.org/f/src/SDT%20V1.92%20-%20New%20Features.swf any idea what this is and who made it?
<Om> I had strong pain meds once, I know they workd because I don't remember them at all.
<Rain> haha
<Phase4> TheRainbowDash, it seems, yeah
<Kammerjunk> But I know drugs aren't the only way to get high. For example, if you have a radio on white noise, cut a tennis ball in half, tape each half over your eyes and finally beam infa-red light through the halved ball, you can get high.
<Rain> I got that when I was getting my ankle surgery
<TheRainbowDash> Phase4: Might as well try all of the options tat you have, before they all run out, I guess.
<TheRainbowDash> (that)
*Shane377 attacks TheRainbowDash ............................... with glomps
<Rain> Kammerjunk that is just sensory over kill
<TheRainbowDash> o_o.......
<XAX> I remember after I has my tonsils out, I was pressing the morphine button every time the limited that stopped me spamming it turned off
<Om> Yea, I broke my arm. Got imediate surgery.
<yifle1> hello everypony
<Phase4> has anyone seen AttackWithHugs recently?
<Kammerjunk> Rain: More or less same effect, though, at least to the unexperienced.
<Jim> hi yifle1
<XAX> Got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom
<XAX> Couldnt tell if standing up, or floating
<RaveBrony> Oh shoot!! Ive got to go everypony!! Cya later and take care!!
<RaveBrony> :P
<TheRainbowDash> Hello yifle1! (waves and hugs) And bye RaveBrony!
<Shane377> TheRainbowDash: wuts wrong dont like me anymore FINE!
<Rain> ever have a flood of endorphins rush through your body?
<yifle1> ;)
<TheRainbowDash> Shane377: I always liked you, silly.:)
<Jim> bye RaveBrony
<Phase4> later RaveBrony
<XAX> Rain: Explain the feel
<derpy_pony> https://images.4channel.org/f/src/SDT%20V1.92%20-%20New%20Features.swf anyone?
*Shane377 throws TheRainbowDash ......... into a pit of hugs
<Shane377> l8r RaveBrony
<TheRainbowDash> Shane377: Ah, not the pit of hugs! Ahhhh!:D

<XAX> Bai RaveBrony :(

<Phase4> damnit, the server i realy like is still not updated
<Shane377> yifle1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ1dYrjuYf4&feature=related
<Rain> Like you are the happiest person alive
<Kammerjunk> Only anestetic I've ever had is laughing gas. Was pretty young, though, so felt like my legs were spinning around me.
<Om> Rain: Then no, never felt that before.
<Rain> run 7-10 miles without stop and you will
<XAX> Kammerjunk: Like a record baby
<Kammerjunk> o u
<yifle1> lol :D
<Om> Rain: If I run that far without stopping I would be more concernd how comfortable the pavement would be.
<Kammerjunk> Happiest person ever? I feel like that anyway.
<TheRandomkid321> http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/4/20/KlYZsL4aPESEupIKbc7a6w2.jpg YEah im starting to post random pics but I fidn em funny

<Shane377> Phase4: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4694/
<Kammerjunk> Rain: I haven't had anethetic since I became a brony. I want to try that.
<Rain> Also, runner's high is the healthiest way to get high
<Meanwhile> Might as well be walkin' on the sun.
<Om> ~don't worry be hppy now~
<TheRandomkid321> http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2012/3/23/b3d9b555-9b10-4836-962f-89ff5c47434c.jpg
<Shane377> yifle1: its what im here for

<Meanwhile> Tbh, entire team should be spy. It's the only way to effectively play.
<XAX> Bloody fruit shop owners
<XAX> Need more snipers

<Vordox> Derpy_Ctrax: It's an emulator :P
<[WUB]JRP2234> saturn
<Phase4> i've got one copy of red and due to fortunate circumstances, two copies of blue
<Vordox> For Gameboy, which was the first 32 Bit sound system
<derpy_pony> I know, Vordox. This is no excuse.
<Saturn> 08,01xmasskills: and a gameboy is a comptuer...
<Vordox> 32 BIT system sound...
<Phase4> Vordox, nope, 8bit sound
<Twi_Fi> It sounds like something is dying.
<Vordox> Phase4: Brb, getting facts. :P
<derpy_pony> it's a gameboy emulator, a modern pc should be able to handle it
<TheRandomkid321> YEAH IT IS!

<Saturn> 08,01this javascript emulator is a bit flakey
<xmasskills> Jim: false gary has a sister that lives in the town
<Phase4> Saturn, go get vba
<Phase4> javascript is no good for emulators
<Phase4> Saturn, if your on archlinux theres an aur package for it
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: there's a pentium emulator in JS
<Phase4> i've seen that one too
<Phase4> slow as balls
<xmasskills> Saturn: can you stream ponies if you do you'll only be my second least favorite mod
<Vordox> Phase4: Sound: 2 square wave generators, 1 PCM 4-bit wave sample (64 4-bit samples played in 1x64 bank or 2x32 bank) channel, 1 noise generator, and one audio input from the cartridge.[33] The unit only has one speaker, but headphones provide stereo sound (for further information, see Game Boy music) Ah shoot D:
<[WUB]JRP2234> Saturn: pm
<Jim> He could stream Ponyta
<TheRainbowDash2> and IM BACK
<Phase4> Vordox, ah, so its mostly 4 bit soudn

<Jim> Spike is best Gary
<Phase4> i had and lost copies of yellow gold and silver
<Om> 8-bit musics for the win.
<Phase4> wish i didnt loose them, gold and silver were great fun
<Vordox> There's a reason people try to avoid using JS. :P
<TheRandomkid321> Does this have a save feature?
<Vordox> Audio is ahead about 2-3 seconds, Saturn
<[WUB]JRP2234> Saturn: can i ask u somthing

<Vordox> This music...memories...
<Phase4> pokemon silver was best pokemon
<Jim> indeed it was
<Saturn> 08,01sure
<Vordox> Phase4: Agreed, before they removed the best things for RUby and Sapphire
<Jim> I love the first generation
<[WUB]JRP2234> saturn did u even look at pms?
<Phase4> imho, it goes Silver > Emerald > Yellow > everything else
<ofna01> its lagging bad on my end
<Phase4> yellow and emerald are actualy about equal
<Saturn> 08,01nope
<Saturn> 08,01i'm playing pokemon
<TheRainbowDash2> dat 8-bit music
<Vordox> Phase4: Mine is Silver, White, rest.
*Phase4 loved his pikachu
<Cypresswolf> I remember you can take advantage of a glitch in original red & blue and get a mew - when you get to the town after mt moon - around the gold bridge...look it up
<Phase4> Vordox, well i havent played white or black
<Phase4> Cypresswolf, i did that, twice
<Kandarihu> Gee, Saturn. I think VBA on Linux would be better than this. This is horrible.
<Vordox> Phase4: You're missing OUT then. It's the second best yet.
<MaidSurge> :O Pokemon stream!
<Phase4> Cypresswolf, you can actualy do it as soon as you get to... the one with the water gym
<TheRainbowDash2> im out see ya tommorow
<Phase4> cerulean
<Phase4> i think'
<Jim> cya TheRainbowDash2
<Phase4> later TheRainbowDash2
<Vordox> Phase4: Day night, Events, catching, Effects, animated sprites, YOU NAME It, even ONLINE Present/Gifts/Adventure if you have WIFI
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: horrible how?
<Phase4> Cypresswolf, but yeah, mew glitch works
<XAX> Omg
<yifle1> cool some pokemon the old game are the best
<XAX> What pokemon, Saturn?
<XAX> I'm not watching :(
<Phase4> XAX, red
<XAX> :o
<XAX> I got the cartridge in my draw
<yifle1> Spike :D
<XAX> All 151 caught :3
<[WUB]JRP2234> Saturn: SOUND IS VERY VERY OUT IF SYNC
<Phase4> its broke here
<Kandarihu> Did you set the text to go slowly?
<Saturn> 08,01i like the charmander!
<DeadpoolDash> So when does Pokemon Rainbow come out?
<Saturn> 08,01because it made a noise!
<Phase4> XAX, you sir have more swag than i
<Jim> They all make noises
<CrazyCherry> Charmander!!!
<CrazyCherry> Take him!!!
<Vordox> NOOO BLASTOISE!
<XAX> Too bad there's no AA batteries in the room. Wanna see if my save still works...
<ofna01> this music is making me sleepy
<CrazyCherry> Yesh!
<yifle1> bulbasaur
<Phase4> Saturn, its red, you have to choose charmander
<Cypresswolf> :) I had a friend tell me in Jr high that to get a mew in the game, you had to first beat the game, elite four, the start at the beginning and walk EVERY space in the game & hit A on each space, and on the last space - Mew would appear
<Om> Chose Professer Oak!
<CrazyCherry> Yesh!!
<Spell-of-Gaming> OH LOOK
<Vordox> XAX:The battery lasts for 15 years... :P In the game tha tis
<Phase4> Cypresswolf, you allso have to use strength on the truck
<Spell-of-Gaming> A WEIRDLY DESIGNED SUPER GAMEBOY FOR THE SNES
<[WUB]JRP2234> AAAAAAA
<Cypresswolf> :D I never did find out if that worked for him
<yifle1> typical charmander
<Vordox> You know what would be awesome guys...?
<[WUB]JRP2234> Saturn: DONT U LIEKS ME
<Phase4> : D
<Jim> what, Vordox ?
<Phase4> lol, no numbers
<Vordox> A SINGLE console to PLAY ALL GAMES ever made of the current generations...
<XAX> Technically that means the battery in the cartridge should have run out by now...
<XAX> OH SHI--
<Vordox> Current and past
<Phase4> Charmander Char
<CrazyCherry> Spike? He does not have the rights to have that name!
<Saturn> 08,01i have no idea what i'm doing!
<CrazyCherry> YAY!
<Ghosties> 04Well everybody, I can't possibly stave off sleep any longer. Have a good day everybody :)
<Phase4> Saturn, audios drifted ahead
<Saturn> 08,01how'd i not hurt him?
<Jim> Cya Ghosties
<Phase4> later Ghosties
<Spell-of-Gaming> Vordox: We have emulators for the PC for that. :P
<Jim> Use Tackle!
*Phase4 hugs Ghosties
<Mutterguy> just keep scratching!!!!
<XAX> Sleep well n shit, Ghosties.
<Vordox> Spell-of-Gaming: NO! CONSOLE > PC
<Cypresswolf> Ghosties: that's when coffee is your best friend :)
*Phase4 growls Squirtle
<Saturn> 08,01i have no idea if i'm winning
<Phase4> at'
<Phase4> Saturn, use tackle
<XAX> Vordox: LEAVE, AND NEVER RETURN
<Ghosties> 04Hehe, later
<Vordox> Saturn: USE HYDRO CANNON!
<Jim> You see that life bar next to his name?
<Mutterguy> too early to call yet saturn
<Phase4> his bar has to be lower than your bar
<[WUB]JRP2234> #define BUCKS_GIVEN_BUFFER
<Kandarihu> The only official way to get a Mew was supposed to be at an event coordinated between Nintendo and any 501c3 tax exempt organization.
<Vordox> XAX: NEVAH! Console games SHOULD BE ON CONSOLE games!
<Phase4> ah, the old growl/tail whip loop
<Vordox> Critical HIT!
<Ascendant> ohai Drake
<Saturn> 08,01yay i one!
<Saturn> 08,01*won
<Phase4> Saturn, that sentence broke my brain
<[WUB]JRP2234> saturn sound is out of sync
<Saturn> 08,01oh, okay, lemme see fi i can fix that
<XAX> Confound bronystate. It drives me to get out of bed, go down the hallway, get 4 AA batteries from the remotes in the lounge, and see if my save file in Red still works.
<Kandarihu> And what happens to fall under that tax code? Christian churches. And unfortunately, there was a HUGE anti-Pokemon movement going on at the time. It was horrible.
<XAX> brb
<Phase4> Saturn, might be the audio rate, 44100 vs 48000
<Saturn> 08,01hoshould be a bit better now
<Cypresswolf> I never understood why you 'black out' after losing your last pokemon in a battle - is losing that much of a shock
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: nah, it's x11grab
<Vordox> Phase4: Oh yeah they had 44100 on the GB?
<Phase4> ah, k
<CrazyCherry> Ev'ryday i'm buffering!
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf: yes
<Phase4> Vordox, nope
<Irres> Ohai
<Vordox> Cause that would be awesome XD
<Phase4> thats better
<Phase4> though lagging a bit
<MaidSurge> Cypresswolf: apparently
<Jim> It's better
<Cypresswolf> Pokemon trainer: O_O I Lost? I'm fed up with this world!
<Phase4> its broken here, let me refresh
<[WUB]JRP2234> dat buffer
<yifle1> its lagging
<Jim> XAX: Just checked my blue version, mine is still working fine
<Saturn> 08,01the hell?
<[WUB]JRP2234> saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01RANDOM ENCOUNTER!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Kandarihu: Same problem as Harry Potter :I They've said that it uses black magic, when it's all about teamwork and stuff I'm too lazy to list
<Vordox> LAWL Saturn XD
<Phase4> its lagging here, i'm not seing anything but the times where you bump into things
<F22skyhunter> sup guys i'm back :)
<Jim> hi F22skyhunter
<Spell-of-Gaming> ohai F22skyhunter
<Phase4> love the music
<Phase4> expertly crafted
<XAX> Jim: I got out of bed, but then it was cold, so I got back into bed.
<Vordox> YOU KILLED AN ANIMAL! Murderer!
<F22skyhunter> http://gyazo.com/b738a7ed7883a04943dfa6aa500a2730 what do you think guys? i drew it couple minutes ago :)
<XAX> :(
<Kandarihu> Well, it certainly doesn't help that Mew is a Psychic type... AND G1 was infamous for Psychic types being overpowered. They were nerfed in G2.
<ofna01> i have a lvl 100 pokemon on platinum
<CrazyCherry> Katamari Damaci!!!
<yifle1> the audio is still not right
<Jim> that looks sweet F22skyhunter
<Jim> ofna01: Only one?
<Vordox> F22skyhunter: Too much RD :P
<Saturn> 08,01ANOTHER RANDOM ENCOUNTER!
<ofna01> my pkachu is lvl 75
<Vordox> F22skyhunter: But damn nice..:Sned it to EQD
<Phase4> sync is better though, seems to be just a latency instead of broke drifting out of sync
<Kandarihu> F22skyhunter: eyes can use some work, but otherwise, that's really nice.
<[WUB]JRP2234> Saturn: :(
<Kandarihu> Phase4: the sync is still way off.
<Twi_Fi> F22skyhunter: Awesome
<ofna01> F22,thats AWESOME
<Phase4> Kandarihu, try refresh your stream
<yifle1> the golbat sprites freaks me out
<Vordox> It's not outsunched me, The effects AND the text and sounds are in sync now to me
<Cypresswolf> I'm still waiting for a pokemon game where that have all the regions included! :) Imagine - a pokemon game that takes just as long as going through everything in Skyrim
<XAX> yifle1: Oh god yes
<Saturn> 08,01[WUB]JRP2234: what?
<yifle1> eww
<[WUB]JRP2234> you watch?
<Phase4> Cypresswolf, I WANT
<Saturn> 08,01OH FFS ANOTHER RANDOM ENCOUNTER
<yifle1> golbat looks so creppy
<Jim> you can flee from them you know
<Cypresswolf> 240 hours in 1st skyrim game and still not done
<Mutterguy> F22skyhunter pretty f***ing good. is it inspired by a fanfic?
<Phase4> Cypresswolf, thats what gold and silver allmost were, if they had the orange isles and a little bit more to actualy do in kanto it would have been epic
<RoboGerbil> hey cypress, diamond and pearl let you explore the regions of the previous games after you defeat the elite 4
<XAX> If Saturn plans to do a full play through, and is going to complain on every random encounter...
<Vordox> Cypresswolf: ...Errr... I had around 320 Hours in my first POke game...FIRST pokegame...
<XAX> Oh lawd
<F22skyhunter> Mutterguy: nope i just wanted to draw steampunk dash :)
<yifle1> its lagging
<ofna01> paused stream,too laggy
<Spell-of-Gaming> Cypresswolf: I wish it can be on the Wii U, AMAZING 3D! Problem is, the Wii U is probably gonna cost like $400 :I
<Vordox> Spell-of-Gaming: That's...not much
<XAX> Who has seen the animated trailer for the new pokemon games?
<Cypresswolf> First pokemon game is always the longest - It took me forever to get through the part with the ship
<XAX> Me gusta.
<Saturn> 08,01[WUB]JRP2234: i'm playing pokemon
<Mutterguy> Spell-of-Gaming, pokemon MMO? i could see it
<[WUB]JRP2234> Saturn: ljkdjosdjlsdfjdfsjdsfklsdjlkdfs
<F22skyhunter> Kandarihu: thanks about the feedback i fixed the eyes. :)
<[WUB]JRP2234> i needs lulz
<Cypresswolf> O_O New Pokemon Games?
<XAX> Cypresswolf: Black and White 2
<Kandarihu> Alright. Well, I'll be back later. I suggest you grab the latest VBA or VBA-M from repository, and find a good torrent for GoodGBx.
<yifle1> WHAT
*CrazyCherry yawns
<XAX> There was an anime trailer made for it
<RoboGerbil> Mutterguy: there are online pokemon battle sites. google them
*CrazyCherry sneezes
<Cypresswolf> :O 2? *looks it up*
<XAX> :megusta:
<yifle1> more pokemon games
<Vordox> Which youtube video title does the BLack and White trailer 2 have?
<Vordox> I find NOTHING animated.
<Twi_Fi> CrazyCherry: Gesundheit
<Cypresswolf> B & W 2 are the 3rd entry in gen 5...what was the 2nd?
<Saturn> 08,01A QUEST
<Spell-of-Gaming> RoboGerbil: Problem is that sometimes you can cheat level up instantly by battling yourself. Yeah, it's a paradox. :I
<CrazyCherry> Twi_Fi: Thanks. :)
<RoboGerbil> Spell-of-Gaming: the ones i saw let you auto put all your pokemon at 100, and let yuo select your skills and stuff
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have Pokemons that are like, Lvl. 300 on an online Pokemon battle site :I
<RoboGerbil> anyone have a working pokemon white rom?
<Mutterguy> Saturn ya being railroaded
<yifle1> its lagging like hell
<XAX> For those who havnt seen the black and white 2 animated trailer, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdp_dLEdqU
<Saturn> 08,01Mutterguy: railroaded?
<XAX> Wait, there's a stream... OH SHI-
<Mutterguy> RPG term... you can't do anything beyond the thinly veiled plot outline... actually kinda silly seeing as pokemon can't support anythnig more than that....
<Om> XAX: there sure is.
<RoboGerbil> an open world pokemon game would definately be awesome
<Ingwaz> time to go to work i suppose...
<Cypresswolf> I love how most games have that invisible barrier - Elder Scrolls Oblivion at least gave you a message when you hit it
<Twi_Fi> Ingwaz: Cya
<Om> Ingwaz: Have fun!
<RoboGerbil> oblivion gave a message when you hit the barrier? i thought the water would just stop you, and everywhere else was mountains
<Spell-of-Gaming> 1. Make original ideas for a Pokemon MMO. 2. Advertise it on YouTube. 3. ??? 4. IT PRINTS MONEY
<XAX> All this pokemon talk makes me want to go and find where I was up to in the manga
<XAX> The manga is good...
<OtakuTom> There were places where there were just plains or even at one point a mountain path, IIRC, where if you tried to go too far, you hit an invisible wall and the game told you you were at the end of the playable world.
<Cypresswolf> The message - "You cannont go that way, turn back"
<SoapyBrony> XAX: Manga is ok...
<Om> I read some of the manga
<XAX> Pokemon manga > Pokemon anime
<Om> Definetly
<XAX> There's actually violence
<SoapyBrony> The anime was horrible
<RoboGerbil> lol anyone who didnt pick charmander is a sucker
<OtakuTom> *currently watching the anime on Cartoon Network, mostly 'cause nothing else is on at this time in the morning*
<Cypresswolf> :) I want a mod where a voice comes that sounds like Bob from Reboot "I can't let you do that, User"
<Om> I only like some of the episode becasue of James and Brock.
<CrazyCherry> http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=5771646
<Cypresswolf> that plays everytime you hit that boundary line
<OtakuTom> Brock isn't in the show anymore, either :(
<Sylandest> so has anyone told Saturn of the rough time he's gonna have when he reaches the first gym?
<XAX> I remember in RBG arc of the manga, when red went to lavender town, I remember when he went into the pokemon graveyard, he got attacked by decomposing bodies of pokemon.
<Phase4> dat forrest
<SoapyBrony> Poke'mon is so...different.
<Saturn> 08,01I CAUGHT ONE!
<Om> Sylandest: Just let him play.
<Saturn> 08,01WOOOOOOOO
<Phase4> Saturn, its drifting out of sync slowly
<SoapyBrony> OtakuTom: Brock was the asian right?
<MaidSurge> WOOOOO
<Phase4> lol, dat metapod
<Cypresswolf> :) Oh that Metapod
<RoboGerbil> lol why would you want a metapod?
<Phase4> Saturn, have fun training metapod :P
<Om> Just let him play xD
<RoboGerbil> its as bad as magikarp
<SoapyBrony> lol metapod
<OtakuTom> Brock was the first gym leader...the one that was obsessed with trying to get a date.
<Saturn> 08,01oh nice, i fullscreened it
<Cypresswolf> who didn't name those after something dirty
<Phase4> RoboGerbil, nope, magicarp is worse
<Phase4> metapod evolves earlier
<SoapyBrony> How do you train a Magicarp
<MaidSurge> Magicarp :D
<XAX> And I remember Green's charmeleon cutting an arbok in half
<Phase4> SoapyBrony, send it out and switch to another pokemon'
<SoapyBrony> Ah
<SoapyBrony> lolz
<Phase4> preferably against something high level
<OtakuTom> I'm excited for Version 2 of Black and White.
<RoboGerbil> SoapyBrony: or get exp share
<SoapyBrony> Yeah
<Spell-of-Gaming> Nickname a Magicarp as "Magicrap"
<SoapyBrony> Makes sense to me
<XAX> OtakuTom: The animated trailer for those game. :megusta:
<yifle1> see ya all later
<Phase4> SoapyBrony, or do what i did, catch a level 40 magicarp, and have it struggle things to death
<Saturn> 08,01looool
<Saturn> 08,01metapod
<Cypresswolf> Magicarp are the biggest trolls - pain in the flank to raise, can't attack anything, but then it evolves into a dragon
<SoapyBrony> LOL
<Phase4> SoapyBrony, it made a baws garydose
<Spell-of-Gaming> Cypresswolf: Pokemon Logic. :I
<XAX> Phase4: >garydose
<Simon2> IT'S SUPER EFFECTIVE!
<MaidSurge> SoapyBrony: also use an object to share experience with the fighting mon :D
<Phase4> XAX, i cant spell :(
<Mutterguy> METAPOD! NO!!!!!!
<somepony_else> ded
<Phase4> is not big suprise
<Om> Gee metapod fainted? How!?
<XAX> I just pictured a Gyarados with Gary oaks head. Thanks Phase4.
<Phase4> XD
<RoboGerbil> wow only 4 stats?
<Welsh_Pony> Which version of pokemon is this?
<Cypresswolf> :) Top 10 disturbing pokedex entries - http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/03/15/weirdest-pokemon-black-white/
<somepony_else> Welsh_Pony: pokemon red
<Saturn> 08,01HAHAHA IT WAS SUPER EFFECTIVE
<Mutterguy> yeah special defense and attack were split in gold and sillver
<XAX> In the manga, Gary(green) is a level headed guy. In the anime he is a total jerk off >)
<XAX> >_>
<MaidSurge> SATURN, GO HEAL THE POKEMONS :D
<MaidSurge> Yep, bugs are weak to fire.
<Mutterguy> MaidSurge, is right, if you go through the forest now ya likely to faint
<Vordox> I don't know if Saturn is trolling or....
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: nope, i've just never played this game before
<Shane377> omg omg oh my gosh

<Meanwhile> I hate pop culture sometimes.
<LunaTheBeloved> Starflash, I missed it too :(
<Kandarihu> Well, it wasn't meant to be realistic, or historically accurate.
<Starflash> wait... what?

*LunaTheBeloved owns it
<LunaTheBeloved> But yeah....effing brother running out of gas
<Meanwhile> As if that might somehow change my initial impression of it.

<GilDash> ScootaBlues: How about Blues/Noteworthy?
<TheMaster> thats going to be some wicked rope burn
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ScootaBlues: just because its not your favorite pony doesnt mean you cant use it as a name
<Om> GilDash: What do you base that opinion off of?
<Pony> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1526/
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Pinkie Pie is my favorite pony
<ScootaBlues> RX-78-SweetieBot: Yeah, plus I've grown used to it after having used it for so long.

<RX-78-SweetieBot> cocaine*
<Om> GilDash: I don't pretend...Much.
<Vordox> DAT MUSIC
<Jim> that's the weirdest joystick ever
<Invi> Pony I don't understand the amazingness of this food utility.
<HyperMetalLugia> Added widescreen support, more colours, motion controls that sucked
<HyperMetalLugia> and yeah
<GilDash> Om: That'll do. :)
<HyperMetalLugia> pretty much, maybe
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<GilDash> Pony: One does not simply understand pizza.
<drfsupercenter> 03PS2 has widescreen.
<MaidSurge> Don't call her Cocaine Pony, she's not a junkie :D
<drfsupercenter> 03just not natively
<drfsupercenter> 03it's per-game
<LunaTheBeloved> Um, What are we watching?
<HyperMetalLugia> GC is just as good as Wii
<Jim> What? I speak fluent pizza.
<Invi> GilDash indeed
<drfsupercenter> 03some games like God of War have it + 480p
<drfsupercenter> 03and yeah
<ScootaBlues> Magical_pablez94: 1. Rarity 2. Octavia 3. Pinkie/Twilight 4. Luna 5. Shining Amor (because of dat voice)
<drfsupercenter> 03Wii is just a wireless gamecube after all
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Well of course pinkie pie doesnt do drugs
<drfsupercenter> 03>Nintendo
<drfsupercenter> 03>Using crappy hardware
<ScootaBlues> Also bear in mind this changes like every five minutes.
<ScootaBlues> also
<HyperMetalLugia> well hey
*ScootaBlues ughs LunaTheBeloved
<Invi> Jim :O you are a god
<Pony> I mean, understanding Pizza is actually more deeper issue, than a reguar Pizza culinarist would think.
<HyperMetalLugia> at least the Wii U will be
*LunaTheBeloved uhgs ScootaBlues
<HyperMetalLugia> Decent
<drfsupercenter> 03only 5 years behind?

<Pony> MaidSurge, don't ever speak about Italians when I'm around
<drfsupercenter> 03GameCube was a bit "eh"
<Invi> does someone here know the art of schwenken?
<TheMaster> did anything that the ship looks sort of like...well
<drfsupercenter> 03decent system but the controller is funky and most of the games sucked
<GilDash> Pony: What's wrong with Italians? :S
<MaidSurge> Pony: why? :(
<HyperMetalLugia> Some games looked pretty decent
<HyperMetalLugia> Hard to find really good GC games
<HyperMetalLugia> But
<Magical_pablez94> ScootaBlues: 1. Luna 2. Applejack 3.Scootaloo 4.Rainbow Dash 5.Vinyl Scratch
<HyperMetalLugia> Star Wars Rouge Squadron 2 FTSW

<CrimsonPhoenix> damn I just hit hard by nostalgia just now
<Skydroid> Okay
<Kammerjunk> Bah, computers can't do anything random.
<Kammerjunk> randomly*
<ScootaBlues> 2,6What happens if you swap them round...?
<TheMaster> you could program it to do things randomly
<RX-78-SweetieBot> 7,11Dont really care that much

<Magical_pablez94> Princess_Saturn: is possible to ban people for racism?
<LunaTheBeloved> You people and your colours

<Pinkies4thWall> MahBoi777: you heard my voice last night, no?
<Pony> It's all about love&hate relationships, they annoy me, I make fun of them (Mostly with stereotypical jokes), they can bare that and we get along. If they get too annoyed, they make fun of me, then we have a stereotype war for few hours and go for a drink. But really, I guess I'd complain about any nationalities I had to live with...
<drfsupercenter> 03I got less than 3 hours of sleep last night
<Starflash> Oh god I believed it.

<Pony> Princess_Saturn, oh I'm just paraspriting the only pony I have ever met who actually got annoyed by stereotypes. To be hnest I have never met one, and I use the N-word, and other racial slurs everyday. I personally believe if we embrace negative stereotypes, they become irrelevant and can be seen only as jokes, building a better world in my own way, I could say. I do the same thing with sexualities and genders, with any stranger, but
<Pinkies4thWall> be sure to burn something Princess_Saturn
<Starflash> oh wait. I didnt do shit. cough

<Princess_Saturn> 08,01which involves pretty much every green spirit you can imagine
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01including absinthe
<Viri> 14not with 3 glasses of wine
<Viri> 14o.o
<ScootaBlues> Princess_Saturn: If I end up going to buck we can test that theory out if you wnat :3

<Princess_Saturn> 08,01ScootaBlues: on the sunday night, sure!
<Pony> Kammerjunk, that's not the worst part, you see my mother has passed... But Saturn was still somehow able to call her, freaky stuff.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like, you're a complete idiot.
