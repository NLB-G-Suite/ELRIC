<BlankFlankBrony> Indeed.
<B-Man> Maybe with Valve, we'll get that Pinkie Sphere mod for real.
<Lucas> Where are you, Revolver?
<B-Man> That would be the greatest win ever, even if I've never fully played either Portal.

<BlankFlankBrony> Greetings, Outline.
<Outline> Hey there Blank.
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Fiddler> outline?
<Outline> Anything of interest happening this morning?
<Fiddler> HI OUTLINE
<Outline> Hello Fiddler :)
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, sorry wasn't paying attention.
<SirSprinkles> 6Thirty BILLION chats open at the same time.
<SirSprinkles> 6But it went quite well, except Starship Troopers was lagtastic.
<SomeFrenchBrony> god......all chats are dead.....
<NewDCD> yeah
<NewDCD> that used to happen to me before too
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<NewDCD> HD encodes are difficult if you don't have a good desktop
<Fiddler> toss some revives everywhere
<BlankFlankBrony> Slow day.
<Silver_Heart> O.o
*Quanyails 7D:s
<Quanyails> 7My butterfly pen is broken.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, it's a laptop, so... yeah.
<Outline> Man... the chat always seems dead whenever I show up. It's marvelous really.
<SirSprinkles> 6And apparently the version I had was HD blueray, so...
<Prominence> Shame.
<Prominence> Oh, uh.
<NewDCD> I can imagine
<Kovigary> let's make it un-dead
<NewDCD> but still
<Prominence> We're working on a small WIP movie at the moment to show.
<NewDCD> it's a problem that in the end was within expected parameters
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, managed to get the lag down to a minimum, so it wasn't that huge of a deal.
<Quanyails> 7On a random note, who wants a Magic Bounce Natu? :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Someponies said it was actually funny and added to the movie, so... XD
<NewDCD> but still man
<NewDCD> we appreciate your work
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Damos02)03WB* - <Nightshadow|VNC> Damos, you will mate with Articuno!
<NewDCD> that said, since you're the only person who has streamed aside from me so far
<NewDCD> I'll let you keep the admin access until someone else streams in place
<NewDCD> since I want it to be indicative of the current streamer and all
<Flamerunner> i'm gonna kill myself
<Flamerunner> i hate my internet...
<NewDCD> I have to keep it since I'm the channel's founder, though, but yeah
<DSD|Pagemaker> 4Hey Cynder
<Quanyails> 7Hmm, Damos?
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4CoD mode
<Outline> Hating your internet is probably not a good reason to do that. Just saying.
<cyrilthepony> :(
<cyrilthepony> sadface for emphasis
<Quanyails> 7Damos?
<Umbreon> 12nooooo
<Quanyails> 7?
<SirSprinkles> 6So, I assume I'm going to be doing Saturdays for a while?
<CW_Williams> hi
<CW_Williams> what's up?
<ZekeS> hi
<NewDCD> if you're up for it
<SirSprinkles> 6I have nothing against it.
<NewDCD> Frankly Saturdays are pretty tough for me
<Cynder7> 6Hey!
<Cynder7> 6Aaa..MW2 ftw. :3
<Fooby> There we go, external drive cleared.
<Outline> Hey there CW. By the looks of things, nothing much.
<Umbreon> 12hi
<Fooby> Now I can back up my laptop fresh before I flood it with episode avis
<Silver_Heart> Wow.
<Silver_Heart> Whoever's writing those fanfics about Trixie and Twilight sure can... write. xD
<cyrilthepony> augh terrible ship
<Silver_Heart> Not really...
<cyrilthepony> :P
<ZekeS> Silver_Heart: which? ballad of TS?
<cyrilthepony> I kid of course
<Silver_Heart> The one about her and Twilight in the spa.
<Silver_Heart> And then the one that follows that story up.
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4Yea
<Lucas> Someone call Rev
<Roleplay4life> 5Hola peoples~!
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, that's fine.
<SirSprinkles> 6My schedule is as open as ever.
<Silver_Heart> Butterscotch Sundae
<NewDCD> that said
<NewDCD> I'm about to propose something for when I get vacation time
<NewDCD> I said I was going to try streaming every day, right?
<SirSprinkles> 6I do believe so.
<NewDCD> or at least, almost every day
<NewDCD> well
<NewDCD> first thing in the order of operations
<Cynder7> 6One question..Is the multiplayer hacked? Cause I heard something like that and I'm intending to get the game.. >.<
<Quanyails> 7Hey, RP4L!
<NewDCD> would be streaming a Hideo Kojima classic, that could be deemed an "Interactive Movie"
<NewDCD> Yes, I am referring to the Cyberpunk Adventure, SNATCHER
<Roleplay4life> 5Was wondering where everyone was. xD
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4Hacked?
<Roleplay4life> 5Falling Skies premieres in roughly half an hour. 8D
<NewDCD> it's pretty much a movie game, and holy shit is it AMAZING to either play or watch
<Cynder7> 6Yeah..
<NewDCD> it could probably be run through in a day or two at most
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4Define hacked here
<SirSprinkles> 6That... would be amazing.
<Barry> I like it
*Umbreon roleplays with Roleplay4life
<Umbreon> 12hi
<NewDCD> and after that
<Roleplay4life> 5I really hope it's good. There hasn't been a good scifi on cable TV since.. well, maybe when USA was forced to cancel The 4400 and The Dead Zone...
<NewDCD> we're obviously jumping into Policenauts
<Roleplay4life> 5Ohi Umbreon~ :3
<NewDCD> because POLICENAUS
<Umbreon> 12:)
<NewDCD> *POLICENAUTS

<Roleplay4life> 5(like if they got into the whole MLP thing)
<HyperMetalLugia> Those people...
<HyperMetalLugia> Should be ignored, sadly </nicething>
<NightSeas> 12I’ve only ever had one legit nick change
<Quanyails> 7My alternate nickname for IRC, as you know, is in case of ghosting or from another computer.

<BlankFlankBrony> Greetings.
<Roleplay4life> 5But I had my bike put away for winter and then I realized "oh.. I should ride this thing".
<Roleplay4life> 5Because I don't drive, I've just been walking everywhere.
<Skylands> 10I can't even recall the last time I used mine
<HyperMetalLugia> I have never been able to ride a bike :|
<HyperMetalLugia> It makes me sad and lulz
<cyrilthepony> good evening Zen
<Roleplay4life> 5And I plan on taking it to college with me in the fall since car lots are REALLY EXPENSIVE anyways. Bike slots are free and I have a lock anyways. |D
<Lucas> Well, shake him off
<Roleplay4life> 5HML, you never learned? D:
<HyperMetalLugia> I did

<Altair> :D
*Altair hugs back
<Archfiend> VNC fucked up
<ZenEffy> what is going on may I ask
<Roleplay4life> 5Lol that's part of the reason I don't like driving is because they /are/ bad for the environment.. but mainly because driving scares me half to death and MORE PEOPLE DIE IN CAR ACCIDENTS THAN ANYTHING ELSE.
<Archfiend> about 10 hours ago
<Altair> bah as usual
<Archfiend> derp
<Archfiend> set up teamviewer

<Nightboomfer> Applejack/RD drinking contest

<DSD|CoDMW2> 4:O he keeps running even if i kill him
<ninjapwny> but then i get into grad school
<cyrilthepony> I'm sorry Zen
<ninjapwny> so more finals
<ninjapwny> eventually
<ninjapwny> :(
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> I was thinking on, instead, streaming games that are much more like interactive movies, as they last longer and can be said to be more involving.
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<ZenEffy> im still in high of the school
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> I have three games in mind.
<Roleplay4life> 5Lol, I'll be back in a few hours.

<Rafasde> Wait... are we secret?
<Roleplay4life> 5(And no offense but family kind of > IRC. ;D)
<Aurora> I'm waiting for my dad to come home
<ZenEffy> it is not midnight
<ninjapwny> u have to put up as much moonbase spam as possible

<Roleplay4life> 5What'd you get him?
<ZenEffy> aeiou
<User_5698> i hated afraid of the dark
<Aurora> and we'll probably spend the night watching NCIS from the beginning lol
<drf|laptop> 03wtf is Falling Skies
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> allow me to elaborate
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> these are the games
<Aurora> the first 2 seasons of NCIS and a Star Trek Enterprise bottle opener :D
<Roleplay4life> 5New show on TNT!
<Roleplay4life> 5IT'S GOT
<Roleplay4life> 5ALIENS
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> the first and second would be Hideo Kojima classics
<Aurora> he's a trekkie lol
<Roleplay4life> 5 8DDDDDDD
<Nightboomfer> That show freaked me out so much as a kid
<drf|laptop> 03heh
<Roleplay4life> 5OMG ME TOO
<Roleplay4life> 5 /shot
<Aurora> you guys would get along well
<SheenaFox> you should watch Doctor Who
<User_5698> indeed
<SheenaFox> from the beginning
<Aurora> 6NO WAY I DIDN'T KNOW
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> the first, Snatcher, which was recently hinted to be getting a sequel in the near future
*SheenaFox runs
<Aurora> 6...

<Aurora> 6no lol
<drf|laptop> 03go watch Scrubs
<Roleplay4life> 5I LOVE DOCTOR WHO.
<SheenaFox> LOL Scrubs
<drf|laptop> 03that's like the only show worth watching from 6the beginning
<Aurora> 6I'll watch Doctor Who from a couple doctors ago
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> making it even more interesting as watching material
<Aurora> 6not the entire thing

<Nightboomfer> I like being freaked out though
<cyrilthepony> Who likes metal
<SillyNilly> Howdy y'all!
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> next, another Kojima game, and the spiritual sequel to Snatcher, "Policenauts"
<SheenaFox> was that on purpose?
<Roleplay4life> 5That's like saying "YOU SHOULD WATCH ALL FIVE (six) SERIES OF STAR TREK"
<HyperMetalLugia> Something strange?
<cyrilthepony> HI!
*SheenaFox flees
<Ascendant> no lol
<Roleplay4life> 5"AND THEN ALL THE MOVIES".
<Nightboomfer> I like metal
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/policenauts/policenauts.htm
<cyrilthepony> are you a silly enough nilly to rescue the president?
<HyperMetalLugia> In the neighborhood .v.

<cyrilthepony> how heavy?
<Ascendant> I've typoed drf's laptop nick as "drf|faptop" >>
<SillyNilly> I am a bad enough dude.
<Revolver> Hello, back again.
<Ascendant> damn your nick, drf
*Ascendant rages

<SillyNilly> *smiles*
<HyperMetalLugia> You secretly like it
<HyperMetalLugia> We're all bad
*cyrilthepony is rocking face to Five Finger Death Punch - Bad Company [04:22m/1006Kbps/44KHz]
<HyperMetalLugia> Somehow :<
<drf|laptop> 03I only tend to misread, not miswrite
<cyrilthepony> hence my bringing it up
<Ascendant> XD
<SillyNilly> Yups
<drf|laptop> 03so I'd make a slightly less defective hard drive than you :D
*drf|laptop rns
<drf|laptop> 03*runs
<Hipster_Brony> 8i think my only issue would be if people are actually going to turn out to watch these
<Ascendant> lmao
<Revolver> I like Five Finger Death Punch.
<Cynder7> 6For some reason I got reminded of this : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VkJpqKRjTw&feature=relmfu
<Revolver> Pretty good.
<Cynder7> 6:P
<Hipster_Brony> 8we had some people getting restless during the Ace Attorney games
<Revolver> Although System of a Down is my favourite.
<cyrilthepony> My voice and his are pretty close, so it makes me all hopeful
<Ascendant> but drf, admit that it's true
*Ascendant hides
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<cyrilthepony> Yea SOAD is a hell of a group
<drf|laptop> 03not really
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont know if people will show up specifically to watch a game
<Ascendant> ):
<HyperMetalLugia> CONE
<HyperMetalLugia> He is god
<Roleplay4life> 5Cone is back! :3
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> these are much more "movie-like"; though
<Ascendant> It's been back
<Ascendant> the entire time
<Revolver> And Disturbed.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah
<Roleplay4life> 5Q IS GOD. /shot
<HyperMetalLugia> But why
<Ascendant> just as Cone2
<HyperMetalLugia> WHY?!
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4Ha :p
<cyrilthepony> Disturbed... now they... I dunno
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<cyrilthepony> Asylum was okay
<Ascendant> !nick ScriptBot
<Ascendant> the hell
<Cynder7> 6:P
<cyrilthepony> but I can't say I like it as much as their older stuff
<HyperMetalLugia> Nice to see the bots are all our overlords
<Revolver> Same.
<cyrilthepony> I think David has improved at singing though
<cyrilthepony> which is nice
<Ascendant> -> /os set superadmin on
<Revolver> Believe was the best.
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> watch the opening of Snatcher, you'll see what I mean http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WchBwgEEZ9s
<cyrilthepony> totes
<Ascendant> I AM THE OVERLORD OF YOU ALL
<Revolver> I have them all.
<Revolver> Lulz.
<cyrilthepony> Ten Thousand fists wasn't bad either
<SillyNilly> Steel is my favorite metal. Such a wonderful alloy..
<Roleplay4life> 5:|
<Nightboomfer> I like Gojira, Iced Earth, The Sword, Demons and Wizards and oldschool Iron Maiden
<cyrilthepony> Indestructible sounded like a... like... Ten Thousand Fists again
<Revolver> Although Serpentine is pretty addicting.
*Skylands defeats Ascendant
<Aurora> 6oh my god RP
<HyperMetalLugia> Go Skylands ;D
<Aurora> 6you look so pretty in your grad photo
<ZenEffy> i know nothing about this
<cyrilthepony> Nightboomfer: I am going to attempt a remake of Winter Wrap-up in that style
*Aurora 6is on the topic of what you look like
<drf|laptop> 03speaking of q
<Revolver> Indestructible was their worst album. Good, but still their worst.
<Nightboomfer> Yes yes very yes
<drf|laptop> 03I saw a whole bunch of trucks at the race earlire that said "KYU" on the side
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh, thank you. :3
<drf|laptop> 03I'm being trolled
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh U
*Nightboomfer Brohoofs Cyril
*cyrilthepony total brohoof back to Nightboomfer
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4MW3 will be great
<Revolver> Funny thing, though because I also like people like Pendulum.
<HyperMetalLugia> Next you'll see DRF
<cyrilthepony> I love powermetal :)
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<cyrilthepony> I like everything Revolver. Except PopCountry
<Roleplay4life> 5My mom's a pretty great photographer. ^^; She can make me look pretty good.
<ZenEffy> lets talk about RAVE!
<cyrilthepony> Okay
<cyrilthepony> I really like the style
<cyrilthepony> ITs pretty intense
<Revolver> I can't stand rap.
<cyrilthepony> toobad doubestp
<Cynder7> 6Yeah :O Actually I was just looking at it on Gamespot.. xD
<drf|laptop> 03but good != hot
*drf|laptop hides
<Revolver> Or Country, but I can stand rap less.
<cyrilthepony> I like rap becuase of nerdcore
<SouthernSkies> Howdy everypony! :3
<Nightboomfer> I like Outlaw country and gangsta rap
<SillyNilly> Hey!
<Roleplay4life> 5I don't need to look hot. Just presentable. xP
<BlankFlankBrony> Greetings, Skies.
<HyperMetalLugia> Did you see her pics again :o
<Revolver> I don't really CARE for Country, but rap annoys me.
<drf|laptop> 03well I like when girls look hot :P
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> as you can see
<HyperMetalLugia> Hot =!= Presentable
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Nightboomfer> like, NWA and Johnny Cash
<cyrilthepony> got ya
<cyrilthepony> hi southernskies!
<Roleplay4life> 5All right well Falling Skies is on ANY TIME NOW so...
<HyperMetalLugia> So Presentable = Good
<ZenEffy> their is no bad genres just genres with a lot of bad music in it
<SouthernSkies> What's the conversation here?
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> the games are more about "watching" than anything else xD
<Revolver> I mean, it's not that it's BAD.
<cyrilthepony> Zen: truth
<HyperMetalLugia> Which means Hot = Bad
<SillyNilly> Yup
*Roleplay4life 5doesn't care what you think, DRF. =P
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> and they are still AMAZING as fuck
<ZenEffy> like country
<Silver_Heart> Zen.
<Silver_Heart> Gangsta Rap.
<Aurora> 6lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Chicken little?
<ZenEffy> what
<cyrilthepony> see, I like the band mushroomhead where they combine superheavy metal and rap
<Silver_Heart> Name 1 good song.
<Silver_Heart> >.>
<cyrilthepony> you can say linkin park does that bu they are not superheavy
<SouthernSkies> Anyone mind fillin' me in on the topic?
<Nightboomfer> Straight Outaa Compton
<RP4L|TV> 5See y'all!
<cyrilthepony> talking about various music genres
<drf|laptop> 03LOL @ Family Guy
*BlankFlankBrony shrugs
<cyrilthepony> California Love
<drf|laptop> 03I've seen this episode before
<HyperMetalLugia> bai?
<Hipster_Brony> 8Well, regardless, i think the reputation of not wanting to "watch" video games might turn some people off
<SouthernSkies> Oh, I see!
<cyrilthepony> such a good rap tuen
<ZenEffy> i dont listen to gansta rap
<Revolver> I also like the old 60's stuff.
<Nightboomfer> F*** Da Police
<Revolver> Like Gene Kelly.
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4Same here
<HyperMetalLugia> You've seen every episode now, haven't you?
<Hipster_Brony> 8people might just write them off out of hand
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> also, the fact that they're Hideo Kojima's most underrated classics could also give some leverage
<SouthernSkies> Well, just t'have a word in it then, I'll say that I like country.
<Revolver> ...
<Cynder7> 6Comes out in November,right?
<cyrilthepony> Is it bad I assumed that because of your name?
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4Yea
<Revolver> We could sort of tell.
<ZenEffy> i hate a lot of country music
<SouthernSkies> Not really. I mean, I live in country.
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> that said
<cyrilthepony> haha
<SouthernSkies> Er, texas
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> I do have a plan
<Lucas> Rev...
<Revolver> Texas is alright.
<SouthernSkies> But I listen to a lot of other things too.
<Revolver> Not as bad as here.
<Revolver> But alright.
<SirSprinkles> 6...this /meta/ thread is reverting backwards into stupidity again.
<SouthernSkies> A few types of Metal, Classical, Some kinds of techno/electronic stuff.
<ZenEffy> i met a ganster from texas
<HyperMetalLugia> And now
<ZenEffy> rave is awesome
<drf|laptop> 03brb
<SouthernSkies> You'd be surprised. Everyone over here thinks they're 'gangsta'
*HyperMetalLugia watches SW=4
<cyrilthepony> I like psytrance
<cyrilthepony> Infected Mushroom
<cyrilthepony> Skazi
<Revolver> I don't get the obsession with skies here in the south.
<Barry> I'd watch them.
<SouthernSkies> I think it's kind of sad when you live in Texas and get made fun of for listening to Country.
<Nightboomfer> It's because they're huge an open and beautiful out in the country
<Cynder7> 6Nice
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> and that is previewing it during an intermission in BMN...just the opening, though.
<ZenEffy> less things to block the veiw of it
<SouthernSkies> You don't get the obsession with skies in the south?
<Barry> I like watching other people play video games That I can otherwise not play myself
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> and using that to gauge interest
<Revolver> I mean, I've been all over the country, and places like Florida have WAY more blue skies than here.
<SouthernSkies> They're just plain gorgeos!
<ZenEffy> i like mane the best
<SouthernSkies> er... gorgeous
<Revolver> Opressive, if you ask me.
<Barry> for instance, I'm watching someone play OoT 3D.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i would be fine with that
<Nightboomfer> SouthernSkies, I am reading all of your replies in Braeburn's voice
<Hipster_Brony> 8see how people react
<SouthernSkies> I like the midnight sky during the summer. There's places that you can go way out in the middle of nowhere and see the night sky the way you're supposed to.
<SouthernSkies> Nightboomfer: Probably a good idea. :3
<Lucas> Great, now I'm being tempted to try Second Life, a game I long known to be the final pithole for games... All because of ponies.
<Revolver> With my hair, walking outside is like dropping a weight on my head.
<SirSprinkles> 6...I feel like playing Majora's Mask and streaming it now. XD
<ZenEffy> what kind of hair is that
<Lucas> A Anvilshaped one?
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> DO IT
<SouthernSkies> Anyway, it's simply beautiful. Stars littering the sky with lights so bright you'd swear it was daytime. :3c
<Nightboomfer> Attention duelists: Look at my hair!
<Revolver> One with a lot of hair, lol.
<Barry> Better than nothing
<SillyNilly> YGOTABS reference
<SillyNilly> I lol'd
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> also
<Barry> Though I hope they take the time to remake the game in 3D, you know?
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> we could additionally run a poll
<Revolver> I'm talking about the fact that the sun beats down really, really, hard here.
<User_5698> texas
<SouthernSkies> In the south?
<Barry> Especially since I like how OoT 3D looks
<Revolver> Yeah.
<ZenEffy> hair = wieght by sunlight?
<Revolver> Alabama isn't fun when you're a nerd.
<SouthernSkies> The sun ain't that much of a problem unless you're not used to it. I lived a while in San Diego and it was freezin' there.
<Barry> As my bro would sometimes shout for no reason: no more polygons
<Revolver> Not my point.
<SouthernSkies> Didn't get anywhere past about 70-80F
<Hipster_Brony> 8good thinking
<ZenEffy> my head can burn me because of how dark my hair is
<Nightboomfer> same, that and I keep mine pretty long
<SouthernSkies> Well what're you sayin' then?
<Revolver> I've lived my entire life here.
<Barry> DCD and I are talking over each other. lol
<Revolver> Not my point not my point.
<ZenEffy> my hair is pretty long to
<Revolver> Wasn't directed to you.
<Lucas> IS your head caked with mud?
<Hipster_Brony> 8we could put it up on the FB page and then link it during the announcements or something
<SouthernSkies> I'm a might confused... ><
<B-Man> You know, I have the avalanche scene playing in my head right now.
<Revolver> Zen, don'tt you live in, like, Mane?
<Lucas> It what makes sense
<cyrilthepony> kind of afc
<B-Man> Man, that was one of the most epic things ever.
<User_5698> you are so southern
<B-Man> :D
<Revolver> Or was that Zeke?
<SouthernSkies> ?
<ZenEffy> yes i live in mane
*Cynder7 6is listening to the fail of the peoples when they see xcal on MW2.
<Revolver> I get you two confused.
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> sorry Barry
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> I think it's a good idea
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> but yeah
<ZenEffy> the summers are hot and the winter harsh and freezing
<User_5698> z's
<Silver_Heart> Sticking every episode of MLP:FiM on my cellphone.
<Silver_Heart> xD
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> yeah Hipster, only thing is I'd rather
<SirSprinkles> 6I like the poll idea...
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> have the preview run first
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> yeah
<Revolver> Same here, except without snow.
<Chimera> 04blah
<Chimera> 04cya Roara >>
<SouthernSkies> I don't suppose any of y'all have seen a filly named ColorSpectrum around here?
<Chimera> 04(late hence the >>)
<Revolver> Well, actually LAST winter had some snow.
<ZenEffy> i had soooo many snow days 
<B-Man> I need more pony songs on my iPod.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, yeah, thats what i mean
<Revolver> Not lately, Skies.
<ZenEffy> thats why im still in school now
<Hipster_Brony> 8we could run the preview during pre-show
<Hipster_Brony> 8like right before the movies start
<HyperMetalLugia> Chimera is a sonic geek
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> yeah, JUST before the movies
<HyperMetalLugia> Or is he :O
<Hipster_Brony> 8but after the EQD post goes up
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> but it has to be like
<Revolver> Lol.
<Hipster_Brony> 8then link the poll
<SouthernSkies> Oh, well that's a bit of a relief. I haven't been on in a while and she was supposed t'be drawin' my pony. :3c
<Revolver> We had a week off because we had a FOOT of snow.
<Hipster_Brony> 8this /meta/ thread is too quiet...
<User_5698> are you a spy?
<Lucas> A foot?
<Lucas> NO WAI
<BlankFlankBrony> Only a foot?
<Hipster_Brony> 8people are writing text walls I'm pretty sure
<ZenEffy> only a foot?
<Revolver> I know.
<SouthernSkies> lol
<Lucas> In ALAMBAMA
<Revolver> People here freak out.
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> when I actually get the dates to my vacation LOL
<Nightboomfer> Snow's srs bzns in the south
<ZenEffy> thats because your town must not be prepared for snow
<Lucas> YA.
<SouthernSkies> I've never seen snow before. Only ice...
<SouthernSkies> And sleet.
<SouthernSkies> And hail.
<Lucas> last time florida HAD ANY snow
<Revolver> Hail sux.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm positive of it, Hipster.
<Lucas> was.... in... 1974?
<SouthernSkies> Yeah.
<Revolver> 1979.
<Revolver> No wait, yeah.
<Revolver> 1974.
<Revolver> Forgot.
<Revolver> I was close, though.
<ZenEffy> same difference
<Lucas> And last time florida HAD negative numbers for temperature was 1877
<SouthernSkies> I was standing at the bus stop when I was little, and it was like 4 in the morning. School started at 6, and I had to sit there in the hail until it came.
<Lucas> :/
<eXAKR> He is
<ZenEffy> sounds painful
<Lucas> 1877!
<Revolver> God.
<Lucas> 134 years ago
<Chimera> 04o0o
<ZenEffy> sooo many dates
<Chimera> 04*o-o
<Chimera> 04where'd this conversation come up
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> I didn't know we had a /meta/ thread
<User_5698> 1877 was a bad year
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> I'm heading there now
<HyperMetalLugia> Boredom
<Revolver> I have to wait outside that long in the winter, but not in HAIL.
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8do you know like, ballpark estimate of your vacation
<Hipster_Brony> 8?
<Lucas> it was called the year without a summer...
<SirSprinkles> 6We don't, DCD
<Chimera> 04k
<Hipster_Brony> 8its about something unrelated
<SirSprinkles> 6We're talking about a drama /meta/ thread...
<Lucas> ANd now we have too much summer XD
<Revolver> A year with a Winter.
<SouthernSkies> Well it's not like it happened every day. It was just that once
<SouthernSkies> Though it was like, pea sized hail
<Chimera> 04I thought you were somehow haxxing into me because I have Retro open up on another tab XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles and i have been commenting on the thread
<Lucas> soo we might have our polar opposite
<ZenEffy> mane doesnt get hail that often
<Revolver> Yeah, but every day in the winter her is like, 2 degrees.
<Revolver> Annoying.
<Lucas> The year without a winter
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe I was ;>
<SouthernSkies> Coldest I ever had was maybe 20F
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> that said
<Revolver> *here
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> I've been thinking
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> we should probably find a way to grow bigger
<Lucas> Colders TI ever had was 40 to 60 degrees
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> considering how big this has gotten
<Revolver> Stupid Tenessee Valley.
<Lucas> Hottest was a blistering 132...
<ZenEffy> i like to have all seasons
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> and I think DinkyPage is starting to be a bit too restrictive
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> we need an actual page
<Hipster_Brony> 8okay
<ZenEffy> thats why i like new england
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, at some point.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont even know where to begin with that though
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> with actual HTML Code Junkies
<BlankFlankBrony> Summer up here is being relatively cool this year.
<Revolver> We don't have fall or spring, lol.
*Quanyails 7is going to sleep early today.
<Quanyails> 7For FINALS tomorrow. o3o
<Lucas> In Florida there's 3 seasons...
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> yeah, still not necessary
<Revolver> May went from 20 to 90.
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> but I expect that with our growth
<Lucas> No winter
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> we might start getting like
<Nightboomfer> Hot, hotter, and rainy
<SouthernSkies> Earlier this month it was around 107 for 4 days straight.
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> 500 viewers during the coming weeks
<Lucas> pretty mucj
<ZenEffy> sounds unberable southernskies
<Lucas> guys question for you
<Revolver> At the beginning of May it got to 20.
<ZenEffy> what
<Lucas> I don't like Second Life, how about you?
<Revolver> At the end it was 94.
<SouthernSkies> Wasn't too bad since I was inside for most of the time, but it was pretty bad.
<Nightboomfer> I've never played
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> I was thinking about perhaps, proposing to the Ponychan admin to give us a /stream/ tab, but I'm kind of against that notion
<ZenEffy> dito
<Lucas> One time, Augustine got flooded
<Revolver> Secong Life is an embarrasment to Bronies everywhere.
<SouthernSkies> I used to play all the time
<Lucas> And I couldn't assess my school
<Nightboomfer> Ponyville is kind of making me curious, though
<SouthernSkies> Me too
<Lucas> it was on a monday...
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> for the sole reason that I want this to stay as a "Neutral Ground" for Bronies
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> kind of like Sweden
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> hence, BronySTATE
<SirSprinkles> 6I think this should be a neutral ground indeed.
<Revolver> MC Ponyville.
<SouthernSkies> I quit a while back, but bronyville is making me want to play again
<SouthernSkies> If anything just to see what it is.
<Revolver> Problem fixed.
<Lucas> And hallways WERE flooded...
<Hipster_Brony> 8good god, !!Twilight is throwing gasoline on this drama fire like nothing else
<Revolver> Play Minecraft.
<Lucas> EHHHH\
<SouthernSkies> I do play minecraft. :3
<Revolver> Problem fixed.
<Hipster_Brony> 8sorry, my attention is split right now
<ZenEffy> minecraft ftw
<Lucas> so school was closed for 4 days getting the water out and drying....
<Revolver> Minecraft has a Ponyville.
<SirSprinkles> 6And then the /meta/ thread went CRAZY
<Lucas> Yes, I know
<ZenEffy> seriously?
<Lucas> I built a town there
<Lucas> Quebuck XD
<SouthernSkies> Wait, it does?
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, i do think we should at least talk to !!Celestia about it
<Lucas> Ponification of Quebec
<SouthernSkies> What's the server IP?
<Hipster_Brony> 8maybe not specifically for us, but it seems like that would be a good board to have around
<Flamerunner> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_lL9F4wiOQ&feature=feedlik ponify this song
<Flamerunner> do it.
<Lucas> bloodisgood.org:25567
<Flamerunner> 4 sum srs lulz
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> another idea is to ask Silverscreen to get working on a new banner. I think it's time to get one with a different feeling...sur, I think this one is great, but I think that for something like this, we need something a bit more minimalistic
<Hipster_Brony> 8and we were kind of originally born out of Ponychan
<SouthernSkies> Creepy. o.o
<Lucas> you have to ask Gachl in MC Forums
<Hipster_Brony> 8I agree DCD
<Revolver> Man, those tornadoes back in April were only three miles away from my house.
<SirSprinkles> 6I agree aswell.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i was actually going to ask him, but i know hes super, super busy right now
<SouthernSkies> I want to make a virtual version of the grand galloping gala
<Revolver> Lol.
<Lucas> Rev
<SouthernSkies> But I dont' know what I want to make it on
<Lucas> did you heard what I said?
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> let's wait for them to get some free time
<Revolver> What?
<Lucas> I had a HUGE flood back in 2003
<Revolver> Oh.
<Lucas> THat closed my school for 4 dayd
<Lucas> trying to get the water out
<Revolver> I can't remember 2003.
<Lucas> so we had only a 1 day weekday
<Lucas> I can I was 7
<Revolver> Not because I CAN'T, but because nothing memorable happened that year.
<Lucas> The hallways were flooded...
<Hipster_Brony> 8sorry again, but jesus christ, !!Twilight is being a giant asshole right now
<Lucas> Jesus
<SirSprinkles> 6Just a little bit.
<Lucas> we couldn't open the class door
<SirSprinkles> 6But he was just basically attacked.
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> I want in
<Hipster_Brony> 8im kind of ashamed i was defending him/her
<Lucas> class doors*
<SirSprinkles> 6And Twilight is always a bit of a prick.
<Aulderbane> Water is amazing.
<Hipster_Brony> 8no, DCD, run far away from this
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> link me please, my browser is being a bitch
<ZenEffy> water pwns ass
<mib_0tluu1> 11Rawr
<Hipster_Brony> 8if you insist
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://www.ponychan.net/chan/meta/res/13749.html
<Retsamoreh> I like water. Water is pretty cool.
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> are you kidding? I'm a friend of justice. It's my job to deliver the hurt
<Lucas> it was like 4 feet amount of watter...
<SirSprinkles> 6I wasn't defending HIM, I was defending the idea.
<Revolver> At the end of the year this year, there was a full week, and then the weekend, and then the last day of school.
<User_5698> im not afraid
<Barry> Hey, Anon1
<Revolver> That pissed me off so much.
<ZenEffy> nice
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have never seen a mod openly call a user an asshole before
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> I knew it
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> sup Silver
<Barry> Silver! Hi
<Lucas> and one foot of it flooded th school
<Hipster_Brony> 8hi silver
<Revolver> The last day of school was a moday.
<Silverscreen> 11What's going on?
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> the last thing a mod can do is take things personally
<Revolver> *monday
<ZenEffy> mine will be a teusday
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> hence why I'm glad with our current mod force
<Lucas> And some of the kids had a surfing contest....
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> none of us takes things personally
<Aulderbane> Keeps ups alive, can kill us pretty damn quick, too. Ahhh, irony.
<Barry> should have known with the different colored text
<Hipster_Brony> 8!!Twilight is trying really hard to get demodded right now
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> a mod must be cold as ice, and elusive as ether vapor
<Cynder7> 6I'd better get going..It's 4:22 am.. :P
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4ok
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4Bye
*B-Man loves being an open brony.
<B-Man> It's so liberating.
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Cynder7> 6See ya tomorrow :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8im a little afraid to post in this thread right now because i know im gonna say something rude to !!Twilight
<Hipster_Brony> 8and i dont want to get banned
<Nightboomfer> it's awesome
<ZenEffy> wooo
<Silverscreen> 11TO be fair, Whelp's slowly become quite the pain in the ass to the mods.
<Aulderbane> Saw the article about SEcond Life. Man, SEth is gonna be overwhelmed there if he tries it out.
<Fooby|CrashingCastles> I don't think he has the time to try it out :P
<User_5698> wooooooooooooooo
<B-Man> I think Lauren has not only done a lot for girls by changing perceptions about "girls television."
<B-Man> But with all the guys that her show has attracted, done a lot for guys.
<Revolver> SUPER PONY CAN'T GO ON MY IPOD.
<Revolver> GAAAH.
<Hipster_Brony> 8true, but !!Twilight has crossed so many lines in this thread
<Revolver> *Super Ponybeat
<ZenEffy> oh noes
<Revolver> D:
<B-Man> Why not, Revolver?
<Silverscreen> 11That's one mod.
<Revolver> I'm so angry.
<B-Man> No room?
<ZenEffy> i know someone with it on thier i pod
<Revolver> I dunno, Itunes hates it or something.
<SomethingDifferent> Anything can go on an ipod.
<Silverscreen> 11Granted some of the mods can be eccentric, but I'm not expecting them to be perfect.
<Revolver> It won't copy...
<ZenEffy> maybe its just you rev
<Revolver> Now I only have Asylum and a few Pendulum songs...
<Silverscreen> 11I myself have had several but-ins with Spikemod because of how he's been hammering on the RPs that go on in /oat/
<cyrilthepony> wek'
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 11Octillery.
<Revolver> And some of the Chrono Cross OST.
<BlankFlankBrony> Apple hates anything it can't control.
<Silverscreen> 11But Everytime something "controversial" involving them comes, Whelp's there to throw accusations about the mod's.
<B-Man> I don't use iTunes.
<B-Man> Then again, I'm running Ubuntu 10.04. :P
<Revolver> Also, I can't get A Hard Day's Night on there...
<Revolver> I'm not that sad about this, because it's SO FREAKING LOUD, but still.
<SomethingDifferent> I use a youtube video rip website.
<Revolver> I love that song.
<Revolver> Same here.
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> damn it
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> my browser's acting up
<Revolver> It annoys me.
<RunningOutofNamesDCD> brb
<Barry> K
<SomethingDifferent> and I can get it on an ipod, *shrug*
<Revolver> Ecept for Asylum, which I bought.
<Revolver> *Except
<Lucas> FINE, i'm going in to see if it is the hellhole that it's claimed to be!
<Lucas> *tlaking about SL*
<Revolver> I can get You Gotta Share and Cupcakes on there, but not At the Gala....
<Revolver> D:
<SomethingDifferent> oh lawdy
<Lucas> I've seen worse...
<Lucas> *looks to tribly* no offense.
<NightSeas> 12Hi Kosovo
<ninjapwny> are we still talking about music?
<ZenEffy> no
<Lucas> Anyway
<Revolver> I have the vocals for You Gotta Share, BTW.
<ZenEffy> well ish
<Revolver> It sound better.
<ninjapwny> ah
<ninjapwny> pwny music
<Revolver> *souns
<Revolver> *SOUNDS
<ZenEffy> lack of ipond pony music working
<Lucas> Linkin Park - In The End IS MY FAV
<Revolver> I can't correct myself today.
<SomethingDifferent> derp
<ninjapwny> uggh lucas
<Revolver> Linkin Park is okay.
<ninjapwny> i added that to my ipod
<ninjapwny> a long time ago
<Aulderbane> SL is a hell hole depending on where ya go. You just find your niche, and go from there. I hang out with my friends in a couple places, and that's it, really.
<Revolver> In the End is SOOO OVERUSED, though.
<ninjapwny> and now i skip it when it comes on shuffle
<ninjapwny> EVERY TIME
<Lucas> I like it....
<ZenEffy> then take it off
<ninjapwny> yea...
<SomethingDifferent> SL is only really good if you already have friends on it. :/
<ninjapwny> i just hate deleting things
*Silverscreen 11reads all of the OP
<SomethingDifferent> other than that it's a grief-fest
<Silverscreen> 11Hmm...
<Lucas> But as everything else, it might get old...
<ninjapwny> im like an e-hoarder
<Silverscreen> 11I gotta admit Soldier has a point.
<Aulderbane> Basicly, SomethingDifferent That right there helps a LOT.
<SomethingDifferent> yeeap
<Revolver> Okay, back.
<Lucas> And Oh dear, Second Life thinks it's too good for my Computer :/
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not sure if I'm posting seriously or trolling at this point. Oo
<Aulderbane> It likes to take up a LOT of your resources.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i disagreed with Soldier at first
<DSD|CoDMW2> 4DX
<Aulderbane> Memory, HD page file space...
<Silverscreen> 11I did to
<Hipster_Brony> 8but seeing the way !!Twilight has conducted himself...
<SomethingDifferent> ^ why people don't play it that much.
<ninjapwny> yea
<Hipster_Brony> 8I'm really disappointed a Ponychan moderator would act that way
<Revolver> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTN2_QscIkw
<Soyuz> ALTAIR
<Revolver> Try this on for size, Lucas.
<ZenEffy> im off to play lots of mincraft
<Silverscreen> 11Until I remembered how Spikemod's pretty much put RPing and Shipping in already-derailed /oat/ threads as Ban On Sight
<Love-Machine> I am LOVE MACHINE
<SomethingDifferent> have fun
<Love-Machine> I Come With a Message.
<Silverscreen> 11I mul of ma cheen
<ZenEffy> i will
<ninjapwny> wooo
<Aulderbane> Because it has tons of unique content that everyone makes. Running games like WoW are easy. Preloaded content. SL has new stuff all the time. It makes my video card quite warm.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol wut?
<Love-Machine> Translate this message if you wish.
<SirSprinkles> 6Come with a message, you say?
<Love-Machine> 0100100100100000011000010110110100100000010011000110111101110110011001010010000001001101011000010110001101101000011010010110111001100101001011100010000001000001011101000010000001110100011010000110010100100000011100110111010001110010011011110110101101100101001000000110111101100110001000000110110101101001011001000110111001101001011001110110100001110100001000000
<Revolver> Your video card has the hots for SL?
<ninjapwny> ooohhh yeeeaaa
<SomethingDifferent> stuff like minecraft runs my computer red hot, always have to put it to low settings.
<ninjapwny> r24?
<Revolver> Sorry, had to.
<ninjapwny> 34*
<ninjapwny> haha
<Silverscreen> 11No thanks.
<Aulderbane> The hots to render alll the stuff there, yeah.
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Aulderbane> :3
<SomethingDifferent> definitely.
<Revolver> I have HALF A TERABYTE of computer.
<Revolver> That can't run CDs.
<Aulderbane> X3
<Revolver> So much fail.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol it's funny because it's not real because it begins with a 0.
<SomethingDifferent> I have 1/4 TB on c: and 1 TB on D:
<Revolver> Most CDs.
<Aulderbane> I have 2 gigs of RAM. Need to upgrade.
<B-Man> Wait...
<B-Man> Hm...
<Silverscreen> 11What's the thread that Soldier is referring to, anyway?
<NewDCD> There seems to be ISP-wide issues on my end atm
<Revolver> Like Oblivion.
<B-Man> Okay, MPR isn't on.
<Revolver> I can't put Oblivion on my CPU without using my Father's computer.
<Aulderbane> Get Windows 7 so I can have awesome pony icons.
*Revolver has Windows 7.
<SomethingDifferent> Yes. Windows 7, because Vista sucks.
<SouthernSkies> Alright everyone, I'm going to get going. Let ColorSpectrum know I was lookin' for her if you see her.
<SomethingDifferent> <-- Sucks...
*Revolver hates the filing system of Windows 7.
<Aulderbane> Aye. I never grabbed Vista. Stayed on XP.
<Revolver> Same here.
<Revolver> Mostly because I didn't pick up a new CPU.
<SomethingDifferent> I feel bad for grabbing vista before windows 7 was invented...
<Love-Machine> If You dont Wish to Translate this Message, you best know that you will all perish at Midnight JST.
<BiiiiigMacintosh> I had no experience with Vista. Bad as everyone said?
<SomethingDifferent> well.
<Revolver> Yeah it was.
<Barry> Hasn't that already passed?
<SomethingDifferent> it's good for the first 2 years
<Revolver> It has a beef with Maplestory.
<BiiiiigMacintosh> Like, ME bad?
<Love-Machine> This Binary Message is perfectly sound. it will translate to ASCII Text without fail
<SomethingDifferent> then let the hellstorm begin
<Aulderbane> FOr some it ran great. Others, not so much
<Revolver> Maplestory was the SHIZ back then.
<Aulderbane> Oh gods ME.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol Japan
<Silverscreen> 11wow.
<Love-Machine> Do none of you wish to lear onf your impending doom?
<SomethingDifferent> When your anti-virus deletes your windows vista genuinity flag 4 times in a row and requires 4 factory resets, thats when you know it sucks.
<SirSprinkles> 6You realize that it won't properly decode due to starting with a 0, yes?
<BlankFlankBrony> Yeesh.
<BiiiiigMacintosh> X.x
<Aulderbane> Hahahaha
<BiiiiigMacintosh> That's painful.
<B-Man> Lol
<SomethingDifferent> and the good avast antivirus too, not the crap
<Love-Machine> sirSprinkles. i have succesfully decoded my message ten times without fail
<Aulderbane> Yeah, I have Avast. WOrks well for me.
<B-Man> Sure that's not a problem with Vista?
<Revolver> Avast deleted Steam.
<B-Man> :P
<SomethingDifferent> aparently it is.
<NewDCD> in other news, I wrote some Ace Attorney fanfiction because I'm a massive faggot.
<NewDCD> in other news, I wrote some Ace Attorney fanfiction because I'm a massive faggot.
<NewDCD> Is anybody interested in reading?
<Revolver> I don't like it anymore.
<Aulderbane> XD
<Barry> Not into Ace Attorney
<Altair> sigh
<B-Man> Why would you let it auto-delete anyway?
<Revolver> I couldn't play TF2 for a MONTH.

<Soyuz> D:
<Altair> i'll see you all tomorrow
<Soyuz> bai ;w;
<Barry> Just ignore the guy, guya
<Barry> guys*
<SomethingDifferent> Avast V6.0 deletes Windows Vista genuinity flags without ur consent even when you have it checked. *shrug*
<Revolver> I dunno, Dad gets sick of me not deleting things.
*Altair hugs #True-Flame
<Love-Machine> GROOOOOOARRRRRRRRRRRRR
<SirSprinkles> 6I will kick you.
<B-Man> Really?
<B-Man> Hm..
<B-Man> Whatta bug.

<Midnight-Sparkle> i said YO.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yo.
<SirSprinkles> 6And you don't have to be rude.
<Midnight-Sparkle> wass up?
<Barry> Yo, Midnight
<Silverscreen> 11Well, the thread in question that Twilight Mod locked doesn't even sound like a parasprite thread.
<Silverscreen> 11It just sounds like somepony stating what they dislike about the fandom.
<Midnight-Sparkle> i Has A Question
<Silverscreen> 11and hell, others were posting the same thing in response.
<Barry> I may has an answer
<Barry> we*
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, Midnight?
<Ray> 02Thx Kos.
*Ray glomps
<Midnight-Sparkle> How do i go about getting admin?
<B-Man> http://xkcd.com/911/
<B-Man> Oh xkcd, you make me lol.
*Kosoveon huggles
<Barry> I don't has an answer
<Hipster_Brony> 8silver, !!twilight locked it because it was turning in to a bunch of petty name calling and personal attacks
<Barry> lol

<Midnight-Sparkle> Darn!
<Hipster_Brony> 8trollface.jpg
<NewDCD> Fastest way? You stream.
<Silverscreen> 11ah. I only read the first few posts.
<Midnight-Sparkle> Maybe Rainbow Dash Has An Answer
<Silverscreen> 11We need to know what you're like during chat, but I'm sorry to say that your particular name doesn't ring any bells for me (then again, I can have a poor memory at times)
<SomethingDifferent> I don't get it.
<SirSprinkles> 6Magic, silly Sparkle.
<Fooby|CrashingCastles> XDD
<Midnight-Sparkle> Friendship is Magic, Silly Sprinkles
<SomethingDifferent> o nvm.
<SirSprinkles> 6You are truly the worst troll ever.
<SirSprinkles> 6You know we can see your hostname, right?
<Midnight-Sparkle> hmm?
<Silverscreen> 11We chose mods based on how they interact with each other, particularly how they deal with parasprites and rule offenders.
<Midnight-Sparkle> Sprinkles, i just got on, that probably was my brother
<Revolver> Lol, you don't?
<SirSprinkles> 6If you say so.
<NewDCD> I believe Midnight-Sparkle has been around from day one, if I'm not mistaken.
<NewDCD> In any case, the easiest way would be to provide a talent or a resource we're looking for, or present a good idea you can help develop that might aid to the expansion and development of BronyState
<SomethingDifferent> I didn't at first, but then I googl'd wikipedia.
<Midnight-Sparkle> Parasprites make lyra Sad!!

<Midnight-Sparkle> :D
<Revolver> That's the point.
<Barry> wat?
<SirSprinkles> 6Meh. I don't trust anything on the internet, so whatever.
*Kosoveon :3
<Midnight-Sparkle> i am an active participant in games, threads, and Friday Brony movie Night!
<SomethingDifferent> Oh. I get it now. *cross-eyed*
<Revolver> The blogger has a COMPULSIVE NEED to correct grammar, so she counters it like this:
<Revolver> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TZcKXqR-I/AAAAAAAACwg/F7AqxDrPjhg/s1600/ALOT13.png
*Ray 
<SomethingDifferent> tru dat
<SirSprinkles> 6I have seen the name, I'm just saying. I'm always skeptical, so... yeah.
<Revolver> As a grammatically conscientious person who frequents internet forums and YouTube, I have found it necessary to develop a few coping mechanisms. When someone types out "u" instead of "you," instead of getting mad, I imagine them having only one finger on each hand and then their actions seem reasonable. If I only had one finger on each hand, I'd leave out unnecessary letters too!
<Silverscreen> We need to change the password for this place tomorrow.
<Ray> 02Yes, I know the secret *-*
<Midnight-Sparkle> Skeptical Sprinkles is Skeptical :D
<Aulderbane> Hee.
<Hipster_Brony> okie dokie loki
<Silverscreen> 11I think this is the first time we actually had someone come to us about becoming a mod.
<Aulderbane> someone typing out hole instead of whole makes me twitch.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not really.
<Hipster_Brony> 8nah, i have had a bunch of people approach me about it
<Silverscreen> 11Everyone else we just picked from the litter.
<Hipster_Brony> 8btw
<Silverscreen> 11oh.

<Hipster_Brony> 8before i forget
<NewDCD> but right now, we're only looking mostly for two things: One, a permanent page to move to, so we'd need an HTML junkie, and two, streamers for the S2 Pony Episodes live, so you'd need The Hub as well as some capture card hardware (and failing to have the latter, be willing to fork out the cash to buy an EasyCap over the internet, although I gather they are quite affordable), PLUS a good PC, preferably a desktop with its own dedicate
<Silverscreen> 11In PM?
<Silverscreen> It's MrLag right?
<Revolver> Alot is better than Michael Phelps at swimming.
<SirSprinkles> 6And Eurobronies, DCD
<SomethingDifferent> 3pk spk ped1mnts.
<Kosoveon> orly
<Hipster_Brony> 8Metal Link has offered to stream new MLP episodes for us once they start
<Barry> I have the Hub, but not the second one
<SirSprinkles> 6We need it to be easier for Saturdays.
<Retsamoreh> You act like you want her to go off on people for their grammar.
<bobdylan> hey there level-headed hipsters
<Revolver> Alots are audible!
<SomethingDifferent> sure why not
<Revolver> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TiTtIFjpI/AAAAAAAACxQ/HXLdiZZ0goU/s1600/ALOT14.png

<Hipster_Brony> sgt. lag i think
<Revolver> They meow!
<SomethingDifferent> would rid the world of grammar nazi's.
<Silverscreen> 11I'm available for Saturday streaming, so You know you'll have at least one mod on the job.
<NewDCD> He has, Hipster?
<NewDCD> Tell him we need to talk, cause that we do.
<NewDCD> We have to test his gear.
<Barry> It's Channel 139 for me
<SonicRainBro> I see what you did there.
<SomethingDifferent> orly
<B-Man> You're not using your words right, people!
<Silverscreen> SgtLag Drop the period and space. :D
<SonicRainBro> Orly is an airport in Paris
<B-Man> I'm amazed at how often people mess those two up.
<Silverscreen> sgtlag
<SomethingDifferent> oh snap
<Barry> but if Metal Link can do it, great.
<SomethingDifferent> I got burrned
<Silverscreen> I see what you meant when you said it degraded into a mudfest.
<NewDCD> no
<NewDCD> I want
<NewDCD> at least three live-capture episode streams

<EccoCode> hey Kosovo
<Flamerunner> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/memes-the-most-interesting-pony-in-the-world.jpg
<NewDCD> as to how to choose who streams for which episode, we could use the randomizer, we cycle them, or we choose depending on quality (slightly dickish)
<NewDCD> Though frankly I put a lot of importance into quality, so I'm inclined to the lastest. Hence, before giving someone the position, we must study their internet speed and computer specs extensively.
<Flamerunner> in my case: I don't always get bored after racing, but when i do, PIES.
<Revolver> http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/03/7-games-you-can-play-with-brick.html
<Revolver> Duck... duck... ':D' ... BRICK!
<SomethingDifferent> *Robots gave us 6 extra seconds of friendship.* Ponies gives us 22 and a half extra Minutes of friendship.
<ZenEffy> how is that advice?
<Silverscreen> 11And then we do a test streaming to ensure that we can get the best picture with the least amount of lag.
<Hipster_Brony> 8lets sort by best quality and connection speed
<ZenEffy> the meme is advice dog
<SomethingDifferent> Wake up on Island, Punch Trees.
<ZenEffy> that is not a advice pony
<ZenEffy> now that is good advice
<Aulderbane> Buck trees, get apples.
<NewDCD> Easycap seems to run for about 9 bucks online
<NewDCD> Although I'd recommend getting it with some accessories. Frankly I don't know which
<naektpov> Drink bleach, live forever.
<Barry> cool
<NewDCD> however

<Flamerunner> why you guys want RD as a lesbian...
<AVeryStrange> Hehe "editor"
<Hipster_Brony> 8but I wouldn't recommend getting involved
<AVeryStrange> as in "dude who'll edit my brain droppings"
<AVeryStrange> Flamerunner: For hot RD x Fluttershy rape scenes obviously
<DesktopDCD> seems it works now
<ZenEffy> cause guys like yuri
<DesktopDCD> this is much easier on the eyes

<Revolver> Where did your obsession with AJ go?
<AVeryStrange> Revolver: Chillax, I was messing

<ZenEffy> then i tip my hat to his engrish
<Revolver> Remember pony dresses?
<Hipster_Brony> !!Scootaloo is occasionally funny, but mostly kind of mean
<Revolver> Okay.
<SillyNilly> Rarity is losing it.. an elegant pony like her shouldn't over do it.
<NewDCD> 9so basically, WALL OF TEXT
<NewDCD> 9everybody who came here to
<Hipster_Brony> at least she's on the /rp/ board now so i dont have to deal with her
<Ghosties> 4Seriously, she was a complete douche to me in our first ever conversation
<SirSprinkles> 6INCOMING THEORIZATION
<NewDCD> 9apply for S2 Streamer Volunteer position
<Silverscreen> 11What was said in the FB/Twitter post is what we meant. We need somepony to stream live with the second season of ponies.
<NewDCD> 9please go to the FB page and read the last comment completely
<Ghosties> 4Good point, I know where she patrols so I don't have to worry about her as much
<NewDCD> 9it shall explain things well enough
<AVeryStrange> I do declare that she may have had a case of the vapors!
<SomethingDifferent> oh dear

<ZenEffy> your quoteing a song arnt you flame
<Ghosties> 4Can we get a link?
<Hipster_Brony> 8saw that DCD
<Hipster_Brony> 8good idea
<ST_Falcon> aulderbane: It's a ponified Etna. Yoko has a pony tail and brighter hair.
<SomethingDifferent> true
<Hipster_Brony> I like !!Trixie too
<Flamerunner> yep
<Flamerunner> ZenEffy
<ST_Falcon> Also a figure and a chest, but those aren't really applicable to ponies.
<Flamerunner> want me to do a Modern Warfare 2 logo with your name?
<Hipster_Brony> !!Spike is funny, but I don't know that he's a great mod
<ZenEffy> yes
<Hipster_Brony> although he is new, so he might just be working out the kinks
<Dusk> dangus internet
<NewDCD> 9http://www.facebook.com/pages/Brony-Movie-Night/158223667581262 just read the lastest comment

<SirSprinkles> 6>DuskBright
<Silverscreen> Good point, HIpster.
<SirSprinkles> 6>lol wut?
<Dusk> restarting and keeping me logged in
<Silverscreen> I don't have much of an opinion on !!Trixie. She seems kinda cool, but I haven't seen enough of her.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol
<SomethingDifferent> time is melting awaaayyy
<Silverscreen> 11Dusk is the name of one of my superheros. :D
<ZenEffy> oh noes
<Ghosties> 4Someone used to come on here with the name Duskfly. I really liked it
<Guest8043526> does anypony know what cable network has the Hub?
<Ghosties> 4Gotta be honest, I'm mostly skimming the meta thread so I can get to Twilight mod
<Ghosties> 4Time Warner
<Ghosties> 4I have the Hub
<Guest8043526> right
<Hipster_Brony> ive had a few conversations with her/him
<Hipster_Brony> !!Twilight posted as anon
<Jazza> http://i.imgur.com/ITgPC.png
<Jazza> sfw
<Ghosties> 4In Soldier's thread?
<Hipster_Brony> 8i have TWC and i dont get the Hub...
<SomethingDifferent> I don't get it.
<Hipster_Brony> 8okay.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<Ghosties> 4: /
<Ghosties> 4Then how do you know it was Twilight mod?
<NewDCD> 9another thing
<Hipster_Brony> the way he phrased things
<NewDCD> 9I propose that the people that apply for Euro Mod Positions
<NewDCD> 9should be given Voice Access during a "probation" period to see if they meet the qualifications
<Silverscreen> I could tell as well.
<PsychicKid> Aulderbane
<PsychicKid> it's etna
<Hipster_Brony> this was the main post that got me upset:
<PsychicKid> there is one of yoko though
<Silverscreen> I skimmed through it, but I have agree with the assessment. Twilight was being a downright asshole.
<Hipster_Brony> directed at Whelp
<Hipster_Brony> Hey, i'm just sick of this flankhole waltzing all over the place, making accusations and snide remarks everywhere. Don't blame me, i'm just doing my job.
<NewDCD> 9by the way, Hipster
*BlankFlankBrony makes his spot check
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah?
<BlankFlankBrony> Clever fox.
<NewDCD> 9have you seen the "make a Facebook ad" prompts?
<Flamerunner> Fun fact, applejack is alcohol
<NewDCD> 9I think we should make one
<NewDCD> 9but
<NewDCD> 9we need to think on what to put in the body
<BlankFlankBrony> Indeed.
<PsychicKid> so you mean addicting right
<SomethingDifferent> Eureka! I figured it out!
<SirSprinkles> 6I was looking at that earlier. XD
<Aulderbane> Awesome, PsychicKid :3
<Ghosties> 4This was !!Twilight's remark about Whelp: Hey, i'm just sick of this flankhole waltzing all over the place, making accusations and snide remarks everywhere. Don't blame me, i'm just doing my job.
<Ghosties> 4?
<SomethingDifferent> There is approximately 21,770,912 seconds until season 2 on MLP: FiM.
<Jazza> OMG
<SomethingDifferent> and counting.
<Jazza> There needs to be a countdown
<Jazza> Website
<Jazza> SOMEONE LINK ME UP ONE
<Silverscreen> 11It requires money
<BlankFlankBrony> XD
<Silverscreen> 11I tried doing it earlier.
<Silverscreen> 11It ain't free.
<SomethingDifferent> I did it using basic time trajectory and estimated completion times.
<Aulderbane> Man, I'm watching the ronies group react to Satch wanting to give SL a try. It's.....not good.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<Aulderbane> The griefers are going to HOUND him if htey find him.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont have any money to do an ad
<Flamerunner> stick a cupcake in your eye
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<SomethingDifferent> perhaps
<Flamerunner> i would.
<Ghosties> 4I see
<Silverscreen> 11I got a $100 charge on my bank account.
<Ghosties> 4It's fine with me
<naektpov> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=countdown
<Hipster_Brony> the content may be correct
<Silverscreen> While I agree that Whelp has become a bit of a problem for the mods, I think !!Twilight was out of line.
<Hipster_Brony> but that's not how you act when you're a moderator
<NewDCD> 9Well shit
<Ghosties> 4Okay, I think it may have been unprofessional and unreserved of him but I completely agree with that post
<Hipster_Brony> !!Twilight was WAY out of line
<NewDCD> 9also
<Silverscreen> 11So no-go on the ad.
<SomethingDifferent> that would help a lot in trajecting my times.
<Hipster_Brony> also, unrelated, i finally figured out to do why wub woo with text XD
<NewDCD> 9how many people have registered to the mailing list?
<Hipster_Brony> /)^3^(\
<Ghosties> 4Oh, uh, question
<SirSprinkles> 6A good few. 19 at last check.

<Flamerunner> I guess every superhero need his theme music
<NewDCD> 9send an email saying you wish to join the list
<SomethingDifferent> well, thats what i get for being out of school 2 and a half weeks before everyone else.
<Barry> Thanks.
<Ghosties> 4So, I see that there's a application process going on for euro mods in the main room. Do us mods have to be involved?
<Flamerunner> No one mare should have all that power
<Flamerunner> The clock’s tickin’, I just count the hours
<Flamerunner> Stop trippin’, I’m trippin’ off the power
<Ghosties> 4I don't want to ask the room and sound like a jackass, I'm just curious
<Hipster_Brony> depends on what you mean involved
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, we're at 20, just added another one.
<Hipster_Brony> by*
<SomethingDifferent> 3,052,855 seconds until release of season 2 approximately.
<Silverscreen> 11Why do you ask, DCD?
<Ghosties> 4Like, are we supposed to be in there doing something? It appears DCD is trying to recruit people. Does he need our help?
<MPR> anyone played ponyhou?
<Hipster_Brony> not atm
<Silverscreen> For the moment, we're just putting word out.
<Aulderbane> I saw that. Made a friend rage.
<Silverscreen> Now that I think about it, We should put a set time for possible recruits to come in.
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL /meta/ thread 404'd
<Hipster_Brony> we're going to have an evaluation period for them
<Barry> It derped

<Guest8043526> and his family
<Ghosties> 4...did you have to sell your xbox for food?
<SirSprinkles> 6There was a Bloodstar in here earlier.
<SirSprinkles> 6Not yet, Ghosties.
<Revolver> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S9nwkvnBiKI/AAAAAAAAC2U/bbEYpwSRdjs/s1600/fakeproducts4(alternate).png

<Ghosties> 4So come Wednesday we'll talk to them on a further basis
<Ghosties> 4What's wrong?
<Hipster_Brony> I FORGOT TO SCREENCAP THAT THREAD
<Silverscreen> 11What question do you have for the canadian, eh?
<Hipster_Brony> I fucking knew it too
<Ghosties> 4Fear not, Hip. I still have the thread :D
<Hipster_Brony> can you cap it for me?
<Silverscreen> Cap what part?
<Ghosties> 4I don't know how to screencap a thread however
<DuskBright> DANGUS INTERNET!
<Hipster_Brony> at least the part where !!Twilight posted?
<SomethingDifferent> Revolver, I'll make sure not to get into your shower anytime soon.
<Hipster_Brony> do you have vista?
<NewDCD> 9something Hipster sent me an email about earlier
<Revolver> It's an adventure.
<SirSprinkles> 6Alright, I'm out. Talk later guys.
<NewDCD> 9night Sprinks
<Barry> cya
<Ghosties> 4No, I have Windows 7
<NewDCD> 9thanks for your hard work
<Hipster_Brony> 8oh yeah

<Revolver> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S839Uu_gRvI/AAAAAAAAC0E/9EbP68c5xO4/s1600/ER10.png
<Hipster_Brony> 8about veemi getting blocked
<SomethingDifferent> oh neat
<NewDCD> 9I don't think Veemi is blocked in any country
<Silverscreen> Mac or PC?
<Silverscreen> Ah
<NewDCD> 9it might be their ISP
<Hipster_Brony> go to accessories
<NewDCD> 9or actually, their flash player settings
<NewDCD> 9not being updated
<NewDCD> 9the works
<Silverscreen> THere should be a button on the keyboard that says "print screen"
<Ghosties> 4PC
<Hipster_Brony> see if the "Snipping Tool" is in there
<Flamerunner> wa.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I have the snipping tool
<Lightning_Quickhoof> YES.
<Ghosties> 4But I've never tried snipping anything bigger than something that's smaller than a page
<Hipster_Brony> okay, open that up and then click and drag over the area
<Hipster_Brony> you can do it in small parts i guess
<Ghosties> 4You mean drag the cursor all the way down the thread?
<Ghosties> 4I'll try
<Silverscreen> 11Of course the villains start showing up TODAY instead of YESTERDAY -_-
<ZenEffy> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/26116
<Hipster_Brony> no, just to cover the part of the window
<ZenEffy> this happens too much
<Hipster_Brony> fuck
<Hipster_Brony> i just realized
<NewDCD> 9in any case
<Silverscreen> wat?
<NewDCD> 9sent them a message in EqD
<DuskBright> lol
<NewDCD> 9they will hopefully see it
<SomethingDifferent> define: "too much"
*Ray rawrs
<Hipster_Brony> !!Twilight posted as anon, so there would be no way for !!Celestia to validate it came from him from a screencap
<ZenEffy> all the time
<Silverscreen> 11DCD, we were thinking of having the potential EuroMods come in on Wednesday for a brief interview
<Aulderbane> Hee hee.
<SomethingDifferent> oh girls just jelly because we are getting all the attention.
<Silverscreen> It's kinda heresay no matter what.
<Silverscreen> OH!
<Ghosties> 4I couldn't just drag the cursor down :(
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<Silverscreen> Get a screencap of the LOCKED post.
<SomethingDifferent> Fox news, remixes, websites....
<ZenEffy> yep but i dont see why they are surprised so much in this chat too
<NewDCD> 9sounds good
<Hipster_Brony> if the thread still existed, !!Celestia could have checked the IP or whatevs
<NewDCD> 9however
<Aulderbane> THe fox news thing was funny, not enraging. people are too serious :I
<Hipster_Brony> dont worry about it ghosties
<SomethingDifferent> Maybe because of the website banner? :) ^^
<NewDCD> 9keep in mind that also means that we need to set an interview time
<Hipster_Brony> it doesnt matter
<NewDCD> 9sadly I won't be home till like 6 PM EST on Wednesday
<Jazza> Can someone fill me in on the Fox News thing? Did they do a report on "bronies" ?
*Leafeon rawrs.
<ZenEffy> but older girls watch this show too
<Hipster_Brony> 8works for me
<Aulderbane> Kinda sorta.
<Ghosties> 4I'd actually want to screencap for purpose of having it for future reference and lol
<SomethingDifferent> they did 2 reports on bronies.
<Aulderbane> Red Eye is not-so- serious stuff
<NewDCD> 9oh yeah I should get to work on the BMN RD-Network page now
<Silverscreen> 11By then it'd be too late. It'd be, what, 11:00 for them?
<SomethingDifferent> and dissed us both times calling us "people who don't go to work just to watch MLP."
<NewDCD> 9I'll name it "BronyState" instead
<Ray> 02How can a Leafeon rawr?
<SomethingDifferent> -quote.
<Hipster_Brony> apparently Soldier requested that the thread be deleted
<NewDCD> 9considering the fact that we might host S2 streams and all
<Hipster_Brony> so it wasnt !!Twilight being sinister
<PsychicKid> >download SL
<Hipster_Brony> thats good to know
<PsychicKid> >go to pony area
<PsychicKid> >See Actionhank
<Aulderbane> STill not enraging.
<NewDCD> 9well, bu that logic, we should also change the FB Page name
<Silverscreen> oh, good.
<NewDCD> 9but in any case, working on it
<SomethingDifferent> theres no profit in SL.
<Ghosties> 4Wait, !!Twilight wasn't the guy who said the thing about Whelp?
<cyrilthepony> NPR always hinted at living in mom's basement and being unemployed
<cyrilthepony> >_>
<Hipster_Brony> 8we went with Brony Movie Night in FB because that's what people will search
<Hipster_Brony> yes, he was
<ZenEffy> im not raging cause i know fox new is too stupid to know better and im not included in this group XD
<Hipster_Brony> as far as we know
<NewDCD> 9I'll also make posts related to mod recruitan and Streamer searchan' in RD-N
<NewDCD> 9who here also has RD-Network?
<SomethingDifferent> wha-?
<Aulderbane> Ding Ding
<NewDCD> 9I might need group adminin' help
<Leafeon> because rawr.
<Hipster_Brony> but the thread was deleted at the request of the OP, not because !!Twilgiht was trying to cover his tracks
<Hipster_Brony> 8i dont lol
<Ray> 02Makes sence.
<Hipster_Brony> 8i know nothing about it
<Flamerunner> Fox News
<Flamerunner> can't get their facts right.
<velociraptor> ORLY?
<Silverscreen> The problem is that !!Twilight posted as Anon, so just a screenshot isn't proof enough.
*Ray yawns and goes to sleep on Leafeon's head
<SomethingDifferent> every news cast can't get it straight.
<RD> ello
<Flamerunner> THEY FUDGIN' CAN'T
<ZenEffy> nope
<Flamerunner> hey RD
<velociraptor> Fox news is the worst offender.
<ZenEffy> and all that was directed only at the guys
<Aulderbane> Which is irony.
<Ghosties> 4Well, it seems Twilight knew what he was doing when he posted as anon
<naektpov> *starts political flamewar*
<Revolver> You become vaguely aware that something isn't right when a feeling of uneasiness engulfs you like a dark, suffocating fog. You realize that you are going to need a sandwich.
<Silverscreen> 11I never even heard of it until yesterday.
<Aulderbane> 'cause Fox was supposed to be 'The answer' to the radically left media.
<RD> Fox is stupid
<SomethingDifferent> >get hosted on fox news
<SomethingDifferent> >Love & Tolerate the crap outta' them
<SomethingDifferent> >get hosted some more
<velociraptor> Yes,because the left is so radical.
<Flamerunner> That lesbian said it.
<Aulderbane> Radical has more than one meaning, but I digress.
<Flamerunner> <RD> Fox is stupid
<ST_Falcon> And the mass media is extremely centrist.
<ZenEffy> what lesbian
<Flamerunner> That lesbian said it right.
<Aulderbane> XD
<ZenEffy> i didnt watch the whole report
<RD> Lets not care what Fox thinks guys, they are wrong over half the time anyways
<Retsamoreh> Did Fox do something bad again? Or are we still whining about the first two.
<velociraptor> Haters gonna hate.
<Flamerunner> how this chat and EAD should be: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo&feature=player_embedded
<Aulderbane> Parasprite's gonna Parasprite.
<ST_Falcon> any leftward bias is most probably due to the fact that journalists have gone through college, and people with degrees are, on average, more left-leaning.
<naektpov> they see me buckin, they hatin
<ZenEffy> lolz
<Aulderbane> Next up: Bronies are just as bad as furries! ..*duckhideflee*
<Flutterbro> >implying furries are bad
*ZenEffy is considered fine to watch MLP
<ST_Falcon> That's unfair to everyone.
<Aulderbane> Exactly.
<velociraptor> Im cool with furries.
<Aulderbane> They will imply that. I'm fine with furries, too.
<naektpov> http://xkcd.com/471/
<Ghosties> 4I'm screencapping certain posts I felt were important
<RD> im fine with furrys but i dont want bronies to get a bad rep like furries
<Revolver> http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/9721/bearchipscomposite.png
<ZekeS> RD: too late :>
<Aulderbane> hahaha. I love that one.
<Silverscreen> cool.
<velociraptor> xD oh XKCD
<ZenEffy> are females still con sidered 'bro'nies?
<Lurkingear> RD that would only happen if the cosplay follows the horse-like style...
<velociraptor> Eeyup.
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<ZekeS> Lurkingear: need I link the RD cosplayer?
<Flamerunner> females are fillies
<Lurkingear> no
<Flamerunner> GET IT RIGHT
<Flamerunner> or i'll make you a pie
<Retsamoreh> According to you, Flame.
<Hipster_Brony> cool, it will probably be worth it to get at least some evidence however circumstantial
<Flamerunner> A TASTY ZenEffy FLAVOR PIE
<ZenEffy> ...
<NewDCD> 9here, group is made
<ZekeS> :s
<ZenEffy> so females cant be bronies
<velociraptor> My girlfriend uses "Bronie".
<Hipster_Brony> is !!Celestia's email admin@ponychan.net?
<NewDCD> 9I'll post a notice http://rainbowdash.net/group/bronystate
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9Silverscreen
<NewDCD> 9we were meaning to ask you something
<Flamerunner> bro stands for brother
<Flamerunner> so yeah.
<Flamerunner> they can't
<ZenEffy> awwwwwwwwwww
<Silverscreen> 11Yessir?
<Lurkingear> they refuse to be bronies... but want to be...
<ZenEffy> what am i then
<velociraptor> Pfff,doesn't mean nothin'.
<Leafeon> so i got an external hard drive
<Leafeon> while on vacation
<Leafeon> lopl
<prince-dari> Females are bronies.
<Retsamoreh> Brony is a term for the fandom, last I checked.
<Lurkingear> its like calling em dudes
<SomethingDifferent> what happened in here I'm lookin' for cool pics
<ZenEffy> wooo
<velociraptor> I call girls dudes all the time.
<velociraptor> XD
<Lurkingear> :P
<Retsamoreh> But NOBODY seems to agree on whether or not it applies to girls too. Which I think is stupid.
<Lurkingear> i rather use the term dudette
<prince-dari> Brony is just a general term for older fans of MLP.
<Ghosties> 4I don't know. In any case, aside from my own screencaps, what posts in particular do you think I should screencap?
<Flamerunner> Zen are you a girl?
<ZenEffy> yep
<Retsamoreh> Obviously.
<Flamerunner> ...
<Lurkingear> Brony is also a small village in poland
<SomethingDifferent> eyup
<SomethingDifferent> i herd that
<Flamerunner> why i treated you like a dude?
<Aulderbane> Heee.
<Lurkingear> consistent of 80 people
<Flamerunner> Lirkingear
<ZenEffy> doesnt make much of a diference
<velociraptor> ^
<Flamerunner> WE MUST INVADE POLAND
<Lurkingear> :Q
<Silverscreen> The LOCK post in the other thread
<Retsamoreh> WWIII, anypony?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> A Brony is an older person who likes MLP, regardless of Gender.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> So, girls are, in fact, Bronies.
<ZenEffy> ^like
<Silverscreen> The one post that caused the /meta/ thread to happen.
<NewDCD> 9we were wondering if we could ask for your creative talents once again
<ZenEffy> sweet
<Lightning_Quickhoof> People in Brony are also apparently Bronies.
<Silverscreen> 11Sure.
<Flamerunner> HELL YEAH
<Lurkingear> WWI was for... vengeance?
<Flamerunner> WW3 :D
<NewDCD> 9because maybe a more minimalistic banner for BronyState would work better
<Hipster_Brony> pretty much all of !!Twilight's posts
<Retsamoreh> They might call themselves Bronites.
<Flamerunner> WW3 => MW3
<ZenEffy> that sounds cool
<Lurkingear> then WW2 was for hitlers hate
<Flamerunner> WW1 was for.
<Flamerunner> yeah
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Everything => MW3
<Flamerunner> it was vendetta
<NewDCD> 9something sleek, streamlined, attractive, yet eye-catching
<Flamerunner> revenge
<MPR> Everything>cod
<Lurkingear> WW3 is for love and tolerance >:D
<NewDCD> 9preferrably monochrome
<Lightning_Quickhoof> True, MPR
<prince-dari> Then suddenly Dari out of fucking no where.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> COD is just bleh.
<velociraptor> http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2011/4/28/14453dd6-d545-44f5-b037-21a6df0b75d2.jpg
<Flamerunner> WW1 was for revenge, WW2 was for power madness
<Silverscreen> 11AH! *fryingpan to Dari's face*
<Flamerunner> WW3 is for PONY CONQUERING
<ZenEffy> i prefer zelda over first person shooters
<Hipster_Brony> 8DAT BACKGROUND ON THE BRONY STATE RD NETWORK PAGE!
<Retsamoreh> I think there was a bit of revenge in WW2 as well.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> WWI was for fear, WWII was for revenge, WWIII will be for the Princess!
<Hipster_Brony> 8jesus christ how horrifying
<SomethingDifferent> WW3 will definitely be over the interwebz.
<Silverscreen> 11How about the Ponyville shot behind the Ponies?
<Aulderbane> Confounded pony chat, I can't pulll myself off to do other things.,
<Lurkingear> Retsamoreh yeah, pearl harbor an all
<SomethingDifferent> for we cannot survive without it.
<ZenEffy> like sleep?
<Silverscreen> 11Monochromed to B/W without said ponies?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Meh, who needs sleep. Ponies are about.
<Ghosties> 4Luckily for you guys I still had the other troll thread up where Twilight said what he said
<Aulderbane> Sleep is in a couple hours. It's only 11pm.
<velociraptor> Sleep?...Whats that?
<SomethingDifferent> It's that thing that.. uhh
<prince-dari> My drama-sense is tingling.
<SomethingDifferent> well ****.
<Hipster_Brony> awesome
<Hipster_Brony> you're the man
<Lurkingear> sleeping makes luna sad D:
<Retsamoreh> What's a sleep?
<ZenEffy> i should sleep now, i have finals tomorrow
<Ghosties> 4I want to make something clear though
<SomethingDifferent> What's a sleep?
<ZenEffy> good night every pony
<Flamerunner> it doesn't take the most powerful nations on earth to start the next global conflict
<velociraptor> G'Night.
<Retsamoreh> gnight
<Lurkingear> seeya Zen
<Flamerunner> just the will of a single brony.
<Aulderbane> I wanted to play some Lufia 2 before sleep. A Let's play by HC Bailey has me starting a new game again.
<Flamerunner> G'night
<Ghosties> 4I do NOT want to catch ANY shit for what may happen
<velociraptor> =D
<cyrilthepony> QHatr?`/
<Aulderbane> Nini Zen
<BlankFlankBrony> G'night Zen
<Hipster_Brony> dont worry
<naektpov> night zen
<velociraptor> I love HCBailey.
<cyrilthepony> HCBAILY
<Hipster_Brony> ill use my name
<cyrilthepony> AND LUFIA 2?!?!
<Aulderbane> yes.
<velociraptor> Not really.
<velociraptor> But I've heard of it.
<Lurkingear> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qruO7SCO0FA&feature=related
<SomethingDifferent> 3,094,322 seconds to premiere of MLP: FiM S2.
<Aulderbane> He played Lufia 1 earlier, now he's ontto 2
<prince-dari> So, mods being assholes seems to be the topic?
<Lurkingear> i dont think seth's posted this yet
<NewDCD> 9Sounds good, I'd like to see what you could bake
<Hipster_Brony> specifically !!Twilight
<NewDCD> 9that said, a base-color font for the title might be good, as well
<Lurkingear> ...i demand more pony metal >: D
<Aulderbane> Oh hell yes.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> HCBAILLY FTW
<Silverscreen> 11You don't like the rainbow for our logo? :P
<SomethingDifferent> pony-metal win
<velociraptor> How HCBailly has so much time for letsplays is beyond me.
<Aulderbane> HC Bailey is awesome. <3
<velociraptor> But I enjoy em'.
<NewDCD> 9it's not that I don't
<SomethingDifferent> He's nice.
<Silverscreen> !!Twilight giving shit because someone was questioning their judgement.
<Lurkingear> nice?
<NewDCD> 9it's just that, consider the rest of the page, which is pretty, well, black
<Aulderbane> It really doesen't take that much time to do it.
<SomethingDifferent> Yes. Nice.
<Aulderbane> he's entertaining.
<Lurkingear> but do you like it or love it?
<Silverscreen> 11That's the point. It stands out.
<NewDCD> 9what I'm trying to say is, we should try to make it look more fitting with the all-black bg
<Hipster_Brony> yes
<SomethingDifferent> ...don't start this
<velociraptor> THIS TOPIC IS OVER.
<Aulderbane> X3
<Lurkingear> tel me!
<Silverscreen> 11Is it really that distracting when we have a stream up?
<NewDCD> 9well, yeah, it's good for it to stand out, but I think we should make it stand out in a different way
<Hipster_Brony> he called basically everyone in the thread a child, and then specifically called Whelp an asshole
<velociraptor> Does anyone have skype?...
<Silverscreen> 11Ah, I see where you're getting at.
<Lurkingear> Tell me! tell me!! tell me!!!
<velociraptor> <-<...
<NewDCD> 9nah, I'm just saying we should try making it fit with the theather theme more
<prince-dari> Lawl, sounds like a great moderator.
<Retsamoreh> I think it's ok
<velociraptor> *Trying to segway*
<Silverscreen> 11ooooohhhhh
<SomethingDifferent> neva
<Lurkingear> okay.mpg
<SoiPony> you could always make the bg match the rainbowness :/
<Hipster_Brony> im going to report him to !!Celestia
<SoiPony> : /*
<Silverscreen> 11soisoisoisoisoisoi
<SoiPony> lol
<NewDCD> 9hence why I suggested a monochrome title...that way you could use a solid color, like, say, purple, to make it stand out
<Silverscreen> 11actually, the eyeroll seemed appropriate there, Soi.
<Hipster_Brony> because it was EXTREMELY unprofessional
<Roleplay4life> 5.....Now that was good TV.
<SoiPony> ehh, if you want
<Silverscreen> 11if you were being sarcastic.
<SoiPony> lol
<NewDCD> 9Well Soi, keep in mind that
<SoiPony> I was
<HyperMetalLugia> Star Wars 6 was better...
<NewDCD> 9a. Black gives the page a "lights-out" feel
<Aulderbane> Just glad to know others know of him <3
<SoiPony> yes, I know. I wasn't serious
<Hipster_Brony> and honestly, if any of our mods here acted like that, they would be gone
<NewDCD> 9b. It also helps save the viewer's electricity! Conscious About the Environment Ranger!!
<Roleplay4life> 5But SW6 was epically amazing.
<Hipster_Brony> and we aren't even as "professional" as Ponychan
<velociraptor> Uhhhhhhhhhh
<Roleplay4life> 5And it was a multi-million dollar film. =P
<velociraptor> Mind if I share me as a pony?
<Roleplay4life> 5LOT more money than a cable series.
<Ghosties> 4Again, I completely agree with !!Twilight's comment on Whelp.
<BlankFlankBrony> Go for it.
<Silverscreen> 11I'll come up with a few designs to show you on Wednesday.
<Ghosties> 4But that's beside the point, I know
<velociraptor> gimme a sec P:
<HyperMetalLugia> Yup XD
<Lurkingear> show yurself!
<NewDCD> 9awesome
<NewDCD> 9thanks yo
<NewDCD> 9that said
<Flamerunner> ihghinioppjhjbrgarhgaerhae ryhaery
<NewDCD> 9Hipster_Brony
<Flamerunner> tried to type fast with one hand
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<drf|laptop> 03and it's on TV :P
<Flamerunner> didn't worked.
<NewDCD> 9has the order for the showings on Friday been selected?
<velociraptor> http://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q368/michaelmon13/Michpony.png
<Hipster_Brony> just because its true doesnt mean you can say it
<Silverscreen> 11Holy hell. This is my first legit request. WHOO!
<velociraptor> http://i349.photobucket.com/albums/q368/michaelmon13/poniess.png
<Lurkingear> lol Flamerunner u so daring
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes and no
<Hipster_Brony> 8we have it tentatively, but I want to change it
<Hipster_Brony> 8because
<Roleplay4life> 5But it was made like twenty years ago or more. :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8right now, we have both our movies in the 2nd half of the broadcast
<drf|laptop> 03so/
<drf|laptop> 03?
<Hipster_Brony> 8and i dont want people to sit through 2 movies with no intermission
<drf|laptop> 03I was made 20 years ago too
<drf|laptop> 03o.o
<Lurkingear> velociraptor: is that a juicebox as yer cuitemark?
<NewDCD> 9I see. I wanted to post it in the RD-Network group though
<Silverscreen> The mod's point isn't the problem. It's how they behaved. I also agree with what TWilight said, but that was not cool.
<velociraptor> Good eye.
<Sakuya> Yeah um sw was made waaaaay long ago
<SomethingDifferent> you wanna hear what I don't like about Hc Bailey?
<Roleplay4life> 5(actually SW was probably more like 25 but um whatever.)
<HyperMetalLugia> 1983ish
<Roleplay4life> 5Point is you can't compare movies to TV.
<SomethingDifferent> He's always drunk,
<Flamerunner> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp_K8prLfso&feature=related
<HyperMetalLugia> Almost 28 years
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<SomethingDifferent> He sounds unentertaining,
<Roleplay4life> 5THAT WAS ONE YEAR AFTER SIGNALS WAS RELEASED BY RUSH. /shot
<SomethingDifferent> He is not funny when he does lets play's
<NewDCD> 9also the FaceBook page has a poll feature
<NewDCD> 9which is awesome
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah. Not only does it give viewers a break, but it gives Mods a chance to rest between movies as well.
<Sakuya> You can but its not a good idea
<SomethingDifferent> He always sounds cheezy when he talks
*Sakuya runs
<SomethingDifferent> I'm unimpressed with him
<Roleplay4life> 5Exactly ^
<Roleplay4life> 5Not a FAIR comparison.
<SomethingDifferent> he has too many caps in his name
<Silverscreen> 11You thinking of putting a poll up in BMN?
<Hipster_Brony> 8heres what i think we should do
<velociraptor> His cheeseyness is the best part!
<NewDCD> 9however, we should probably make it an off-site poll
<SomethingDifferent> he uses an emulator, not the real thing
<NewDCD> 9for people who don't have FB
<Aulderbane> Opinion noted.
<SomethingDifferent> and he doesn't do anything that is challenging.
<velociraptor> "Q_Q"
<SomethingDifferent> but, whatever you think is fine.
<Hipster_Brony> 8spiders web, feeling pinkie keen, se7en, fall weather friends
<NewDCD> 9Silverscreen: I want to gauge interest in a non-Movie Night broadcast
<Aulderbane> Indeed. :3
<NewDCD> 9namely, of playing Kojima's SNATCHER
<NewDCD> 9which is by all extents and purposes, an amazing interactive movie
<Silverscreen> 11so you want to stream outside of BMN events, like what Sprinkles did yesterday with that marathon of Kenan and Kel.
<drf|laptop> 03so how about
<drf|laptop> 03Terminator: TSCC was probably better
<NewDCD> 9pretty much
<drf|laptop> 03:D
<Silverscreen> 11That was fun.
<SomethingDifferent> this is the part where you see Rarity's Face in complete awe and everything is silent.
<NewDCD> 9we'll also notify the viewers of these off-schedule streams
<HyperMetalLugia> The what?
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Has anyone heard the "Psychoshy Battle" by Renard?
<Roleplay4life> 5Naaaaaah, I'd disagree.
<drf|laptop> 03Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles
<Roleplay4life> 5I wasn't too impressed with that.
<drf|laptop> 03amazing TV miniseries made about Terminator
<SomethingDifferent> I have, but never saw it.
<drf|laptop> 03then you suck :|
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay
<Sakuya> Sarah connor-
<NewDCD> 9via the FB, Twitter, RD-N pages, the mailing group, and finally, during BMN themselves
<Sakuya> Yeh
<Roleplay4life> 5And again, robots, not aliens.
<drf|laptop> 03the first season, at least, was amazing
<Silverscreen> 11It'd be good to have a set time for them so that we aren't bombarding their emails with the new streams.
<drf|laptop> 03I have both seasons on DVD
<Roleplay4life> 5It got canceled anyways.
*Roleplay4life 5runs
<drf|laptop> 03I should get the Blu-rays
<drf|laptop> 03that would be cool
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<drf|laptop> 03and hey
*Lurkingear sees rarity's face in complete awe and everything is silent
<drf|laptop> 03who's to say this show won't get cnaceled
<Roleplay4life> 5LIKE ALL MY OTHER FAVOURITE TV SHOWS. O^O
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(eXAKR02)03WB* - <eXAKR> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon-Punching bendy buses!
<Roleplay4life> 5It's on cable. Less chance of cancellation.
<Aulderbane> 'But I thought you -wantd- whining?!'
<drf|laptop> 03not really
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Well, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfy5W8AJqIY&feature=related. Don't be fooled by the beginning 16 seconds.
<Lurkingear> miss rarity, please stop! what would cereal think if he knew?
<SomethingDifferent> can we skip scenes in here or do I need to drag Lauren Faust into this chatroom to make everyone go OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
<drf|laptop> 03speaking of which I saw about 50 TNT channel operators today.
<Roleplay4life> 5Actually, less competition and less dependence on advertisers making choices compared to broadcast because people pay for television.
<Roleplay4life> 5How do you think USA manages to hang onto its shows for so many years? (;
<Roleplay4life> 5The only reason The Dead Zone and The 4400 got canceled was because of the Writer's Strike.
<Silverscreen> 11....
<drf|laptop> 03USA has shows?
<drf|laptop> 03I was aware all they showed was movies and syndicated stuff
<Roleplay4life> 5Uh, YEAH.
<Silverscreen> 11so we need to figure out a set time.
<Roleplay4life> 5OMIGAWD
<Aulderbane> SO. 20 million before Season 2 opens?
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok guys, i gotta get some sleep
<drf|laptop> 03and like, wrestling and crap
<Roleplay4life> 5BEST DRAMAS ON TELEVISION
<Roleplay4life> 5AND COMEDIES
<drf|laptop> 03>Drama

<drf|laptop> 03>Good
<Roleplay4life> 5AND DRAMEDIES
<Hipster_Brony> 8ill talk to y'all tomorrow
<drf|laptop> 03>my face when

<drf|laptop> 03Best show ever
<drf|laptop> 03no]
<Roleplay4life> 5AND BURN NOTICE
<drf|laptop> 03that show looks tsupid
<BlankFlankBrony> I'd say so.
<Roleplay4life> 5IT'S GOT SPIES
<naektpov> of course
<Roleplay4life> 5 8DDDDD
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Silverscreen> 11Dari, I'm surprised you're up so late.
<Lurkingear> that's the goal
<drf|laptop> 03My roommate's gf liked that show
<Roleplay4life> 5What looks stupid?
<Roleplay4life> 5D:
<SomethingDifferent> not sure.
<drf|laptop> 03I watched one episode
<Silverscreen> 11er, early
<drf|laptop> 03and was like o_O
<prince-dari> Haha.
<drf|laptop> 03Psych looks stupid.
<Lurkingear> we celebrate 20m with ep 1
<Roleplay4life> 5But Dule Hill~ D:
<Barry> Hi again, guys.
<drf|laptop> 03who?
<prince-dari> My sleeping hours got screwed up.
<Lurkingear> or 27, whatever u may call it
<SomethingDifferent> I know how much time approximately until Season 2
<Silverscreen> 11Ah.
<prince-dari> I'll probably go to bed soon.
<Silverscreen> 11Hi, Barry.
<drf|laptop> 03also
<drf|laptop> 03>Fangirling
<Roleplay4life> 5Shawn's partner! (He plays Gus.)
<drf|laptop> 03= no
<Silverscreen> 11That's cool.
<Outline> Of course we'll hit 20m before S2 begins.
<SomethingDifferent> but I don't want to get everyponies hopes up.
<Roleplay4life> 5That is not fangirling.
<Barry> Sorry I was away. I had just finished watching DBGT episode 64
<Outline> Hell, at this rate, 30 isn't out of the question.
<drf|laptop> 03liking shows because of an actor? That's pretty darn close
<Barry> It was bad quality
<drf|laptop> 03with T:TSCC they were all "With that one girl from 300" and I wa slike who?
<Roleplay4life> 5That is freaking out over a legitimately good show in a world of stupid reality TV.
<drf|laptop> 03completely different type of acting LOL
<SomethingDifferent> 3,093,617 seconds until premiere of S2 of MLP:FiM
<drf|laptop> 03in 300 she was naked, she's not in Terminator
*drf|laptop runs
<Jazza> "Brony Blue"
<DuskBright> DBGT! HAH
<Jazza> I was trying to remember this song
<Roleplay4life> 5And for the record it's an ensemble cast. I like the whole cast.
<Roleplay4life> 5I like the writing.
<Roleplay4life> 5I like the script.
<Roleplay4life> 5I like its originality.
<Lurkingear> O_O
<drf|laptop> 03heh
<drf|laptop> 03well
<prince-dari> So does anyone have a problem with the filter kicking instead of muting? If we added how to rejoin the channel to the kick message, rules, possibly topic, etc?
<Roleplay4life> 5And I feel the same way about all the other shows on USA.
<drf|laptop> 03usually I just like the plot
<drf|laptop> 03generally
<capt_slowpoke> I got the DTs, bad. I need more pony.
<drf|laptop> 03stuff on USA sucks unless it's a movie
<Lurkingear> thats 3000000 too long
<drf|laptop> 03at least from what i've seen
<Roleplay4life> 5To each his own. (;
<drf|laptop> 03same with TNT, really
<NewDCD> 9well
<SomethingDifferent> well, that is interesting
<NewDCD> 9with "Off-Schedule"
<drf|laptop> 03it's all OMFG WTF IS THIS WRESTLING BS
<NewDCD> 9I kind of mean
<Roleplay4life> 5Leverage?
<prince-dari> Just mass voicing/unvoicing is pretty inconvenient.
<drf|laptop> 03now, they show NASCAR, which was cool because I was ther.e
<NewDCD> 9"Not at 7 PM EST Friday"
<Hipster_Brony> 8apparently the original thread that caused !!Twilight to blow up wasnt even a parasprite thread :D
<SomethingDifferent> apparently, if you click MLP:FiM you will freeze the chatbox
<SomethingDifferent> interesting indeed.
<Roleplay4life> 5I think Leverage is epic. But that's just me.
<Silverscreen> 11I figured that.
<DuskBright> ?
<prince-dari> Ohai Hipster.
<NewDCD> 9as in, they are aired at times which might not be "regular"; but they WILL have a set time
<twentypercentcooler> hmmm
<Hipster_Brony> 8anyway, with that im gonna go for realz
<Nightboomfer> hullo
<Hipster_Brony> 8see you guys tomorrow
<Roleplay4life> 5And now I must poof again as much as I'd like to continue this little debate with you. :C

<B-Man> Don't you just all love storms?
<B-Man> Having one here.
<SomethingDifferent> because this stole their thunder: http://www.wipeouthd.com/
<drf|laptop> 03who, me? :D
*drf|laptop hides
<Jazza> I'd love a new F-Zero
<Nightboomfer> I love the sound of thunder
<Light_Latias> hai Danny oxo
<Silverscreen> 11So when does the interactive part come in?
<Nightboomfer> Storms are pretty relaxing, IMO
<SomethingDifferent> Storms are awsome
<DuskBright> curiosity. it has been gained
<DuskBright> dangit
<Gaben> I'm Gabe Newell.
<Lurkingear> srsly cptain falcon needs some updating before the new smash comes D:
<Jazza> SomethingDifferent laaaaaame it's for the PS3
<HyperMetalLugia> No
<HyperMetalLugia> OOT3D > DRF
<HyperMetalLugia> U mad?
<Ghosties> 4Okay, listen, I've screencapped all the important bits I think need to be screencapped but I don't think I'm gonna go through with this. I seriously DO NOT wanna get in the middle of what could potentially be a large shitstorm. I hope you guys don't think any less of me, but it's wayyyyyy too easy for people to find out where the screencaps came from
<SomethingDifferent> people got it for free if they had a PSN acc
<SomethingDifferent> XD
<Gojira007> ...well THIS is a new feature.
<Ghosties> 4Even if Hipster says he'll take the blame
<NewDCD> 9it comes after the intro, duh
<Prominence> ?
<HeatWave> A new F-Zero? Where!?
<SomethingDifferent> http://www.wipeoutHD.com/
<NewDCD> 9it's part interactive movie/part visual novel/part lightgun shooter
<Flamerunner> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HejyAiZYXI
<NewDCD> 9oh, and a sequel might be coming soon
<Silverscreen> 11awesome.
<Lurkingear> HeatWave exactly TT^TT
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<drf|laptop> 03I am
<drf|laptop> 03>:|
<NewDCD> 9since during E3, a poster for "Snatcher - Episode 2" was spotted in the Konami workspace
<prince-dari> Take the blame for what?
<Silverscreen> 11Now will you be streaming gameplay or vids like this?
<NewDCD> 9gameplay
<NewDCD> 9the full game
<prince-dari> They should be able to take criticism.
<NewDCD> 9it's not very long
<HeatWave> I need to make a Brony Blue of the Big Blue GX theme.
<NewDCD> 9it's around 5-6 hours
<RedDragonX> you all suck
<NewDCD> 9I've already streamed it before
<B-Man> Tornado producing storms, even?
<B-Man> >_>
<Silverscreen> Hipster wants to report !!twilight to !!Celestia for being a douche
<NewDCD> 9it's one of those movies/games you want to pick up and play every couple of years
<Barry> For a movie, it's long. For a video game, it's short.
<NewDCD> 9which is funny
<SomethingDifferent> I just love to run around in circles in the parking lot at night with a tornado warning and the pegasi ponies throwing thunderbolts at me. Quite Invigorating.
<HyperMetalLugia> Too bad, since OOT3D is closer to LL
<Silverscreen> 11That sounds fucking awesome.
<NewDCD> 9because I'm not the type to replay or rewatch movies
<HyperMetalLugia> Than you :D
<NewDCD> 9well
*HyperMetalLugia shot
<Lurkingear> who doesnt?
<NewDCD> 9I could stream an Act a day
<NewDCD> 9the game is made up of three Acts
<NewDCD> 9also, after that
<Barry> cool
<NewDCD> 9I'll stream the spiritual sequel, Policenauts
<Silverscreen> 11How long is each act?
<NewDCD> 9it all depends
<Silverscreen> 11Depends?
<Retsamoreh> insert generic quote from portal 2 here
<NewDCD> 9 2 hours I'd say, except for the last one, which is a bit shorter
<Stormy> You too
<Silverscreen> 11Are we talking about Chat being involved as well?
<Stormy> :D
<B-Man> Are you crazy?! /Twilight Sparkle
<RedDragonX> yes yes
<Silverscreen> 11or just you playing?
*Light_Latias 12sighs tho
<Kosoveon> OoT 3D
<SomethingDifferent> <With Ponies, you get 6 moar seconds of Friendship.*
<Kosoveon> <3
*Kosoveon is playing it now
<Jazza> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYf64O-tsy4
<Light_Latias> 12D:<
<NewDCD> 9just me playing, but I meant, "it all depends as to how far the chatgoers wish to go"
<Light_Latias> 12MIEN
<Flamerunner> BAM
<HeatWave> The ponies would not please the administrator.
<Light_Latias> 12how far r u?
<NewDCD> 9if they want me to keep going once Act 1 is done
<Flamerunner> Ponies gave us 6 extra seconds of friendship
<NewDCD> 9we'll keep going
<Flamerunner> good job ponies
<Ghosties> 4I know that but I seriously don't want any kind of banhammers falling on me for doing seedy work
<Kosoveon> goron city
<NewDCD> 9so it might be done in one sitting
<NewDCD> 9or two
<Kosoveon> I just started playing
<Flamerunner> Flamerunner, we're done here.
<NewDCD> 9or three
<prince-dari> [04:17] <RedDragonX> you all suck | Is that why you love us?
<Silverscreen> 11ah.
<NewDCD> 9as I said, it's pretty much an interactive movie
<RedDragonX> lol
<Light_Latias> 12you're further than me ._.
<Kosoveon> got saria's song
*Light_Latias 12only played it for 10min
<NewDCD> 9so it doesn't give you THAT much freedom
<Nightboomfer> All the ponies in this town are crazy.
<Light_Latias> 12and nao playing it again
<Kosoveon> wb aurora
<Light_Latias> 12JUST learned Sarias Song
<Light_Latias> 12hai Roara
<Ghosties> 4Say it is Twilight mod that said all those things, whose to say he doesn't find out that I was the one who caught him with his hand in the cookie jar and then swiftly boots me out of Ponychan
<HeatWave> "You have disappointed me with your friendships!"
<Barry> nice
<Flamerunner> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RLm9t-hOPo&feature=player_embedded
<Flamerunner> This crazy?
<Silverscreen> How would he find out?
<Nightboomfer> Since we've seen the mane cast break down, what if literally every pony is going insane from a dark secret, like the shadow over innsmouth
<Silverscreen> 11Sounds cool.
<Kosoveon> lon lon ranch theme <3
<Flamerunner> Nightboomfer...
<SomethingDifferent> I want that youtube song to play when i turn on my phone, my TV, my lamp, my computer, my door, and my wife.
<Flamerunner> the internet happened
<Light_Latias> 12lol
<Silverscreen> 11We just need a time to do it so that everyone knows when to show up.
<NewDCD> 9some gameplay http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbKmDzHXc0E&feature=related
<NewDCD> 9I'm thinking a Saturday
<Silverscreen> 11Saturday is when we do the Eurostream.
<Light_Latias> 12STFU Kaepora Gaebora >_>;;;;;;;
<SomethingDifferent> what, too soon?
<Nightboomfer> Fanon goes to weird places between seasons...
<Aurora> 6so is OoT3D amazing?
<Ghosties> 4I don't know, but I wouldn't put it beyond him
<Light_Latias> 12YUSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Kosoveon> yes
<Aurora> 6lol
<Silverscreen> 11The gameplay is a lot like Ace Attorney...
<BlankFlankBrony> True.
<Lurkingear> quite
<Light_Latias> 12everythings polished and the 3D MAJORLY adds to it
<Chimera> 04hi LL
<Chimera> 04and nice
<Chimera> 04I want eeeeeet

<Light_Latias> 12and hai Chime
<Chimera> 04... X3
<B-Man> BBL.
<Silverscreen> All you need to do is E-mail the pictures to Hipster and everything would point to him. He's the only one of us who posted in the forum, he'd be admitting to taking the screenshots, and he'd be the one to send the email.
<Nightboomfer> bye
<DuskBright> what is this? and why do I want to get it
<SilverSonic> OMG I so want OoT3D :D
<B-Man> Running second life and would like to free up resources for it.
<Barry> I found a cute comic that is unrelated to the current discussion
<Light_Latias> 12btw
<Silverscreen> 11NewDCD that reminds me.
<Light_Latias> 12as promised
<NewDCD> 9except it has a lot of voice-acting-talking
<NewDCD> 9also, dat voice acting in 1994
<Chimera> 04?
<Silverscreen> 11Thanks for getting me addicted to that fucking game.
*Light_Latias 12DID get the first copy |3
<Chimera> 04xD

<User_6686> Man, Drawfriend was really good today

<Barry> Apple Bloom, Pinkie Pie, Applejack, and Big Macintosh
<Nightboomfer> yeah it was
<Ghosties> 4I just don't like getting my hands dirty
<Light_Latias> 12its a Club Nintendo thing
<Nightboomfer> I didn't mind the OC drawfriends too much
<Chimera> 04k
<Lurkingear> well gotta go now
<SilverSonic> heh Im at Zora's domain in teh VC Version of OoT XD
<drf|laptop> 03uh

<drf|laptop> 03so you get it for registering your game?
<naektpov> bye
<SilverSonic> what soundtrack tho?
<Kosoveon> yes
<Kosoveon> and doing a survey
<SomethingDifferent> Well.
<Barry> Here it is http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/169/6/0/hey_pinkie_pie_____by_dreatos-d3ja1v0.png
*Kosoveon already got his ordered :D
<Kosoveon> 50 tracks ftw
<Barry> You may have to open it in a new window to view it
<SomethingDifferent> .....
<Silverscreen> This isn't so much as being seedy as it is performing a civic duty. Twilight showed that they might not be the ideal mod they might have been once before, and I agree with Hipster on reporting them.
<SilverSonic> can someone tell me what soundtrakc please? x-x
<Barry> or tab, if you're using Firefox
<Kosoveon> to OoT 3D
<drf|laptop> 03I dunno but it's prolly already leaked :P
<SomethingDifferent> *clop*
<Earl_J_Hickey> hallo
<SilverSonic> well
<Kosoveon> it's a club nintendo offer
<SomethingDifferent> hello
<SilverSonic> I need this soundtrack
<PossumFace> yay
<DuskBright> lol
<NewDCD> 9Edgeworth and Kay. Shipping. Because I'm a fag like that.
<Barry> nvm, lost it
<Earl_J_Hickey> My name is Earl
<SilverSonic> for RN
<Earl_J_Hickey> *Snickers*
<Aurora> 6is the soundtrack different from the original one?
<Barry> somehow
<SomethingDifferent> Nice to meet you Earl welcome to the herd
<Aurora> 6minus the fire temple...that was all drama
<Silverscreen> 11I don't remember Kay for some strange reason...
<Kosoveon> i think there are some added tracks
<Silverscreen> 11I just played the game a couple of hours ago.
<Earl_J_Hickey> C'MON MAMMA
<Chimera> 04you mean fire temple?
<Kosoveon> not much other than that
<Earl_J_Hickey> O'COCKLE
<PossumFace> My name is awesome. :3
<Aurora> 6I said fire temple lol
<Chimera> 04oh
<NewDCD> 9she appears first in Case 3
<Earl_J_Hickey> yea okay
<Chimera> 04I misread as first XD
<SomethingDifferent> agree
<Aurora> 6lol
<Chimera> 04"There is chanting IT MUST BE OFFENDING US"
<Chimera> 04>.>
<NewDCD> 9you might just not be that far
<NewDCD> 9plus it has spoilers
<DuskBright> which game?
<NewDCD> 9I'll show you when you finish the game
<Aurora> 6that chanting was so amazing though
<NewDCD> 9Ace Attorney Investigations
<User_6686> Possum Face :>
<Aurora> 6I LOVED that temple FOR that song
<Chimera> 04people will complain about ANYTHING.
<Chimera> 04and yes
<PossumFace> Indeed.
<Chimera> 04it was amazing
<Silverscreen> 11I'm on the last case.
<Silverscreen> 11Rising from The Ashes.
<Gaben> My name is Gabe Newell.
<Gaben> Hopefully it will have been worth the weight.
<Gabe_Newell> Uh no
<drf|laptop> 03I thought it sounded annoying myself but I'm all for not being politically correct
<Silverscreen> 11Tell you what, them cases get intense.
<Ghosties> 4Okay, listen, Soldier started that thread with the intent of professionalism yes? That meaning that mods conduct business in a orderly fashion with reserve and restraint. Soldier himself displayed that kind of professionalism when he refused to give names on who did the rude lock post.
<twilightsparckle> .......
<Gabe_Newell> I'm gabe newell
<NewDCD> 9oh
<Gaben> My favorite class is the spy.
<drf|laptop> 03hence why I love the unedited version of Savages, and Arabian Nights
<Ivan2294> Hi
<Nightboomfer> Oh man are you a face stealer?
<Nightboomfer> or like a mimic
<NewDCD> 9certainly you won't remember it
<Ivan2294> Wait waht....
<Ivan2294> wtf is going on?
<SomethingDifferent> let us sit here for the next 2,094,112 seconds for the release of S2 in MLP: FiM.
<NewDCD> 9Ace Attorney =/= Ace Attorney Investigations
<PossumFace> I've been on this site 199999664 times and I never noticed this here talky box.
<NewDCD> 9I'm referring to the game you play as Edgeworth
<Gabe_Newell> I win
<SomethingDifferent> You Didn't? :D
<Ghosties> 4Do you think it'd be the best of US, as mods ourselves, to really sink to the level that !!Twilight did and go behind his back and try to get him reprimanded?
<NewDCD> 9you should
<SomethingDifferent> same here.
<Light_Latias> 12brbs
<NewDCD> 9probably play in this order
<Chimera> 04k
<Gabe_Newell> Yes i do
<SilverSonic> Kosvoeon, once you get this soundtrack cd can you upload it
<Ivan2294> talky box
<Ivan2294> ha
<Nightboomfer> same, until I found it
<PossumFace> Well now I feel less derpy.
<SillyNilly> Welcome to this talky box PossumFace
<NewDCD> 9AA > AA2 > AA3 > AAI > Apollo Justice
<Nightboomfer> now my life is slipping away slowly...
<SomethingDifferent> thought it was blocked advertisment from my adblockplus.
<SilverSonic> seeing as i dont have a 3DS or OoT3D
<Ivan2294> So, who here is getting MW3, but already owns Black Ops or MW2?
<Silverscreen> Point. However, if we were someone on Ponychan and saw that someone was paraspriting the hell out of somepony else, what would we do?
<Ghosties> 4There were plenty of people posting in that thread, whose to say someone didn't already screen cap it
<PossumFace> I just never scrolled down.
<User_6686> Time to find that TF2/Pony crossover pic
<Gabe_Newell> lol
<SomethingDifferent> you wanna know life slipping away slowly?
<Gabe_Newell> LOSER
<Gordon_Freeman> No love for me?
<DuskBright> I need to find AA2 and AA3 I have AJ and I need to find AAI so that I can actually play it
<Gabe_Newell> BattleField 2 bish
<Ivan2294> *Battlefield 3
<SomethingDifferent> 3,092,356 seconds to premiere of S2 of MLP: FiM.
<Ivan2294> fixed
<Silverscreen> Somepony most likely did. Doesn't mean they'll report it.
<SomethingDifferent> and counting.
<NewDCD> 9AAI is hard to find
<NewDCD> 9or so I hear
<Kosoveon> ok
<Ivan2294> How many days is that exactly?
<Silverscreen> 11Ah.
<Kosoveon> thing is
<NewDCD> 9Capcom didn't distribute it too well
<SomethingDifferent> 35 days.
<Kosoveon> it doesn't ship till like July 3
*Silverscreen 11is using a ROM to play it.
<Aristeo> :3
<Ivan2294> really?
<Kosoveon> and I'll be away for like a month on a family trip
<Gabe_Newell> Uh no
<Nightboomfer> oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh
<Ivan2294> What proof you got?
<SomethingDifferent> 858 hours
<Ghosties> 4First off, !!Twilight was covering his tracks if so. The only thing that he'd have going against him is the lock post. Otherwise, everything else is purely circumstantial; it could have been any random joe on the site
<SomethingDifferent> 51538 minutes
<Kosoveon> so I won't actually be getting it till like early August
<Silverscreen> 11AAI was the one you were streaming, yes? Involving the investigation on the plane?
<Gabe_Newell> Welcome to MLP: FiM Season 2
<Gabe_Newell> after 2 months
<Silverscreen> 11With the grape juice.
<SomethingDifferent> that was a month ago
<Gabe_Newell> hopefully it was worth the wieght
<SilverSonic> ;o'
<SillyNilly> Oh my, it's Gabe Newell!
<Fiddler> season 2?
<SilverSonic> how bout LL then XD
<PossumFace> 525, 600 miiinutes
<Fiddler> i want it
<SomethingDifferent> since MLP:FiM stopped on May 6th
<Ghosties> 4We can't literally point the finger at !!Twilight and go "all those anon posts were him!" because we don't know
<SilverSonic> i can wait to get it early july or till someone leaks it onto the internet
<SomethingDifferent> aaand I just screwed many ppl over who just clicked that link
<SillyNilly> When is Episode 3 being released?
<NewDCD> 9yes
<NewDCD> 9precisely that one
<Gabe_Newell> Uh
<Plentity> I thought S2 was premiering in August/September
<Retsamoreh> Valve time or normal time/
<SillyNilly> I demand to know!!
<Silverscreen> Actually, we do know.
<Gabe_Newell> We are currently not working on it
<Ivan2294> As of April 2011, a second season was confirmed and is currently in development. Twenty six episodes from this season are set to be completed by December 2011[3], but other information, including the premiere, is currently unknown.
<Silverscreen> Thanks to the very post mentioned in this chat.
<NewDCD> 9also Apollo Justice was released before AAI, but AAI takes place earlier in the timeline, for all that it matters
<SillyNilly> On a relative scale, our time preferably
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Oh, you Silly Nilly. There was something saying Valve is heading towards Multiplayer games from now on.
<SomethingDifferent> S2 premieres 2 months after S1. on average
<jasperbot> Bye!
<Kosoveon> i would help if I could ^^;
<SillyNilly> Oh, that's too bad.
<Ghosties> 4Which post?
<Kosoveon> but those mp3s will be readily available soon anyways
<SillyNilly> *brandishes a knife*
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
<Gabe_Newell> Now to kill the wait
<Lightning_Quickhoof> They'll finish Episode 3 whenever they feel like it.
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Ivan2294> Same with Black Mesa
<SillyNilly> *slices an apple*
<Lightning_Quickhoof> It's not good to rush it.
<Flamerunner> ...
<Ivan2294> When they feel like it
<Gabe_Newell> Left 4 Dead 2: Episode 1 will come out
<Silverscreen> "Hey, i'm just sick of this flankhole waltzing all over the place, making accusations and snide remarks everywhere. Don't blame me, i'm just doing my job."
<Plentity> oh don't you know?
<Silverscreen> "I'm just trying to do my job"
<Plentity> Valve can't count to 3
<Gabe_Newell> with 5 new maps
<Flamerunner> it's like duke Nukem's release date
<Flamerunner> "when it's done"
<SomethingDifferent> S2 MLP: FiM set parameters 2011/07/25 18:30 on http://www.7is7.com/otto/countdown.html
<Ivan2294> So, who here is actually going to buy MW3, yet owns any of the previous games.
<Gabe_Newell> and 9001 new special infected
<Silverscreen> This points to it being Twilight, since Twilight is the mod that's being questioned throughout the thread.
<Gordon_Freeman> I'll buy Minecraft instead.
<Ghosties> 4They were all anonymous
<Gabe_Newell> Uh no
<SilverSonic> heh good. cause i really wanna be the first DJ to get my hands on this soundtrack XD
<Flamerunner> Ivan
<Ivan2294> I hope NO ONE buys
<NewDCD> 9oh by the way, Silverscreen
<Silverscreen> But the content of the posts makes it clear.
<Flamerunner> did i showed you my drawing with my open helmet?
<Ivan2294> It's the same game....
<Lightning_Quickhoof> No, Gordon. It's not worth your time.
<NewDCD> 9your emulator better have microphone support
<SomethingDifferent> I have minecraft
<naektpov> leaving, see ya bronies
<Ivan2294> No Flame
<NewDCD> 9cause you're gonna need it for that case
<Ivan2294> bye
<SomethingDifferent> cya
<Gabe_Newell> I hate ponys
<Kosoveon> if you play lon lon ranch I will be like the FIRST one to tune in ;P
<Silverscreen> 11o.o
<SomethingDifferent> I have minecraft. Imma get Terraria too.
<Ivan2294> GTFO
<Silverscreen> 11That sucks.
<NewDCD> 9if you're using No$GBA
<Ivan2294> They're both good
<NewDCD> 9there's nothing to worry about
<SomethingDifferent> troll
<Ivan2294> MC is more creative though
<Nightboomfer> but we wuv you
<Silverscreen> 11I don't have a mic.
<SilverSonic> also i just found an OoT Remastered Soundtrack
<Ivan2294> Terraria has better combat
<NewDCD> 9you can emulate it, I believe
<NewDCD> 9you just need it to blow
<Nightboomfer> embrace the tolerance
<SomethingDifferent> trudat
<Silverscreen> 11ah
<NewDCD> 9there are workarounds.
<SomethingDifferent> hopefully 1.7 Mc update fixes that
<OhYeaPinkiePie> ok
<OhYeaPinkiePie> :D
<SomethingDifferent> you suck at changing names
<twentypercentcooler> ...
<SomethingDifferent> I can c dat
<OhYeaPinkiePie> You suck at sucking
<OhYeaPinkiePie> :3
<SomethingDifferent> Perhaps
<Ivan2294> That's a compliment though righ?
<OhYeaPinkiePie> WELCOME TO APPLELOOSA!
<SomethingDifferent> but everyone gets to yell at you in the end
<SomethingDifferent> for delaying episode 3
<Ghosties> 4No it doesn't, if anything, it makes it sound like Scootaloo because Scootaloo is also a jerk. The posts were made anonymously, that means !!Celestia, nor anybody for that matter, could find out which mod said it because the person hid behind anonymity. I don't think you can find out who made those posts simply from a screen cap either.
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Fooby!
<Flamerunner> Well i gotta go
<Flamerunner> See you tomorrow everypony
<Aurora> 6ZREO?
<Nightboomfer> bye
<Fooby> Meee!
<Fooby> I mean Hi
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Wemember me?
<Fooby> Also see yah Flamerunner
<Ivan2294> So has anyone done Ghost Recon ponies yet?
<Fooby> And that I do
<Gordon_Freeman> What about HL2 Ponies?
<HyperMetalLugia> ZERO?!
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<SomethingDifferent> omg no
<Aurora> 6I love ZREO
<SomethingDifferent> no
<SomethingDifferent> no
<SomethingDifferent> no
<Ivan2294> I want ghost recon ponies, that would like awesome.
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh, ah..
<Gordon_Freeman> Got a problem, mate?
<Plentity> Ghost Recon ponies? OoOoh.
<SomethingDifferent> ok, stop imposing at people from Valve and watch this
<Light_Latias> 12FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFS why isnt the confirmation email showinmg up?! >_<
<SomethingDifferent> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E26PHTskO6U
<Light_Latias> 12-m
<Ivan2294> I could totally do a forum sig if someone were to vectorize some.
<SomethingDifferent> omg Zekes did something
<SomethingDifferent> *stare*
<NewDCD> 9Silverscreen http://www.nogba.com/no$gba-microphone.htm
<Ivan2294> I really, REALLY want Ghost Recon ponies now.....
<ZekeS> ... I'm tempted.
<ZekeS> Oh so very tempted.
<Ghosties> 4...actually, !!Twilight made a mod post in the thread
<User_6686> Of course it loops
<SomethingDifferent> eyup
<Ivan2294> And I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want a forum sig of said ponies
<Nightboomfer> Rarity is adorable even when she's whiny
<Silverscreen> Consider the following: The original post that caused the thread to appear was by Twilight Mod. Twilight makes a single post in said thread before vanishing. Afterwords, it's nothing but anon posts. Posts that have quite the striking resemblances to the thread in question. At the very least, we can safely assume that the anon was at least a mod based on
<Silverscreen> based on the context of that one post. At the very least, this shows that SOMEPONY among the mods deserves a look at.
<Ivan2294> Agreed
<Revolver> Heluuuu again.
<Plentity> how in Celestia's name is this looping
<Ivan2294> I say she is even MORE adorable when she whines
<Ali1017> cause this is EquestriaDaily, it always loops
<Silverscreen> to the post in question*
<SomethingDifferent> It`s an act of the gods
<Revolver> *leers eyes*
<SomethingDifferent> and we only post stuff that loops xD
<Plentity> hah true enough Ali
<Aeroslash> night all
<Ivan2294> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuFuAsXYtu0
<Revolver> Gah, lag.
<Ivan2294> No loop so HA
<Plentity> hmm I'm not feeling Rarityish tonight
<SilverSonic> <Aurora> ZREO? <-- Nup i Have that one, this one is different
<Kosoveon> night aero
<Aurora> 6oh
<Silverscreen> 11I use something called.... DeSmuME
<Ivan2294> What would your name be if you were ponified.
<Nightboomfer> Night Boomer
<Ivan2294> BOOMER *fires M16*
<Nightboomfer> rrrarhg
*Nightboomfer throws up
<Revolver> twinkie100
<Light_Latias> 12night Slash
<Light_Latias> 12ok
<Light_Latias> 12its there
<SomethingDifferent> where was it I saw it somewhere.
<NewDCD> 9thing is
<Light_Latias> 12and Im in...
<Revolver> Dangit.
<BlankFlankBrony> I'd probably figure one out as I go along.
<NewDCD> 9just use
<Light_Latias> 12blah I'm having no patience tonight ._.
<MiddaySparkle> Oh Ivan... you don't use an M16, you use the dual pistols.
<NewDCD> 9Audacity or something as your sound input
<NewDCD> 9play a random sound
<Revolver> Man is it laggy today.
<Ivan2294> But those suck after getting, well, any weapon at all.
<NewDCD> 9and it will make the "Microphone" function for you
<Ivan2294> Besides Single Pistol
<Silverscreen> 11I see that it has a microphone function, yeah.
<Ivan2294> Or magnum and melees depending on your taste
<NewDCD> 9also No$GBA + No$Zoomer is the best DS emulator
<Revolver> In what game again?
<Ivan2294> L4D2
<Ivan2294> Or one
<Ivan2294> Both actually
<Revolver> Oh, i see.
<NewDCD> 9Scale 2x + hq2xS filter = HNGHHHHHH
<Revolver> I like Meelee.
<NewDCD> 9dat quality
<Silverscreen> 11I tried that as my first choice, but the download link it provided didn't work for some reason.
<MiddaySparkle> but DP has the speed of an assault rifle but with unlimited power
<eurobeatBrony> I prefer Brawl.
<Gordon_Freeman> Honk.
<Ivan2294> Brawl is better
<MiddaySparkle> I still have my Melee
<SomethingDifferent> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTkyUNHBzMA OH GOD IT LOOPS
<drf|laptop> 03:/
<eurobeatBrony> Melee is still pretty darned good.
<drf|laptop> 03about that
<drf|laptop> 03plz get on Xbox live
<Revolver> I don't like Brawl because Lucas is a wimp.
<Ivan2294> Banjo-Kazooie!
<twentypercentcooler> those vids dont appeal to me
<Silverscreen> 11OH! I can download "OBJECTION" from youtube and use that as the Mic sound. XD
<Revolver> HUZZAH!
<twentypercentcooler> they flash to many images at once
<twentypercentcooler> its like brain over-load
<eurobeatBrony> OH DAMN. Droppin' Banjo Kazooie on us.
<Aurora> 6ffffffff my usual group of people are gone
<Revolver> Banjo-Kazooie!
<Ivan2294> For some reason I feel as if a BK RPG would somehow work....
<Aurora> 6I feel lacking lol
<Lucas> Wait what????
<Lucas> Rev
<Lucas> HOW
<Gordon_Freeman> A what?
<Lucas> WHAT
<Lucas> WHEN
<Ivan2294> Like if it was like Mario RPG
<Revolver> Heluuuu
<eurobeatBrony> Ivan, most Rare Games are really RPGs in disguise.
<Lucas> UHHH
<Ivan2294> how?
<SilverSonic> lol
<Lucas> COMP SCHEDULE LOPPHOL"D?
<MiddaySparkle> Really now?
<SomethingDifferent> PONY cRAZE UP IN THIS cHATBOX
<eurobeatBrony> Collecting jiggies? Music notes? Eggs?
<Lucas> ARE YOU NOT BRACED ANYMORE?
<eurobeatBrony> Bring item X to character Y?
<Revolver> I've BEEN on here.
<Lucas> Um...
<drf|laptop> 03this is why cliques suck
<Ivan2294> So it's more like the annoying sidequests
<Aurora> 6...
<Revolver> And besides, it's 10:45.
<Aurora> 6that's not what I meant lol
<Ivan2294> Texas?
<Revolver> I've got fifteen minutes.
<Barry> I'm going now. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Same time, same place?
<Ghosties> 4Wait, how do you have what he said?
<User_6686> Banjo-Kazooie was an MMO and I didn't even know it
<Ghosties> 4If that's what he said
<Revolver> Aw hell yeah.
<Aurora> 6but yeh, I'm usually skyping with them or my boyfriend, all of which are gone tonight it seems
<Lucas> BUT YOU...
<Ivan2294> I once dreamt about Banjo-Kazooie
<Lucas> nvm
<HyperMetalLugia> Boyfriend :O
<Lucas> nvm'
<Revolver> But what?
<Lucas> I got confused
<Ivan2294> Nothing happened though
<Revolver> You're confusing.
<IceMane> oh hello bronies
<Ghosties> 4If that's what !!Twilight really said, I mean
<Lucas> you
<Ivan2294> It was just the game, but on a level that never existed
<Revolver> Heluuuu
<Lucas> re conshooting
<IceMane> im streaming every ep of yugioh abridged while i play WoW
<IceMane> http://tinyurl.com/3kem4t2
<Silverscreen> You and Hipster said it yourselves.
<Ghosties> 4You called them up verbatim
<eurobeatBrony> Oh Gawd. BKMMO.
<eurobeatBrony> I'd play that.
<Ivan2294> Losing Rare to Microsoft is one of the gaming industries worst moments EVER
<NewDCD> 9night Barry
<eurobeatBrony> Seriously.
<NewDCD> 9pretty much
<Revolver> ^ true fax.
<Ivan2294> After that, we lost all hope for another amazing platformer EVER AGAIN
<NewDCD> 9that said, Silverscreen
<Ali1017> WoW oh how dumbed down it is now
<eurobeatBrony> Notice that several of Rare's masterpieces were on N64.
<Revolver> Also, Whoopee Camp.
<Ivan2294> *that wasn't Nintendo
<NewDCD> 9that sorta defeats the purpose the of the "Objection" mic sound LOL
<Silverscreen> Earlier, in the chat.
<Revolver> I loved Tomba so much.
<Ghosties> 4Hipster said that Twilight called everyone children, that's most certainly not the case
<Ghosties> 4If that was in fact Twilight
<SomethingDifferent> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czNoQXwQ4kA OH LAWDY THIS ALSO LOOPS
<eurobeatBrony> I never got to play Tomba. D:
<Fooby> Tomba is awesome D:
<Ivan2294> Banjo-Tooie is what I consider to be the best game ever
<Ivan2294> of all time
<Fooby> I never got to beat it.
<eurobeatBrony> It's that guy that jumps on pigs a lot, right?
<Ghosties> 4All he said was that he felt all this arguing was going to fix nothing
<Fooby> Also when'd EB come bck o.o
<Fooby> back*
<PsychicKid> chacha doesn't know who my waifu is
<eurobeatBrony> A little bit ago, had to grab mah charger.
<Ivan2294> Conker would've one, but Banjo got to me first, and it has a wider audience
<Revolver> Yes.
<Ivan2294> *won
<Revolver> That would be the one.
<eurobeatBrony> Honestly, I never played Nuts & Bolts, but
<Ghosties> 4The only other anonymous posts
<eurobeatBrony> it seemed to force a gameplay mechanism into a series that didn't need it
<Revolver> It was the first video game I had the luxury of playing.
<NewDCD> 9I meant that for the
<NewDCD> 9obligatory parts
<eurobeatBrony> Was it better than that?
<NewDCD> 9with the fingerprint powder
<Revolver> What?
<Ivan2294> I heard that Nuts & Bolts was pretty bad
<Ivan2294> But I do want to know if those very few platforming segments worked
<Ghosties> 4Were the warning to Whelp, and a post that pretty much said that his view of the site and the people in it weren't going to change because the people on the site will always view him in the same light
<Ghosties> 4Nothing about children
<Ghosties> 4He didn't specifically berate the posters
<Ghosties> 4Except for Whelp
<Ghosties> 4And that was absolutely called for, IMO
<Ivan2294> Hey, if you guys miss rare, try the BK game on GBA
<ZekeS> oh hey someone named EBB
<Ivan2294> It isn't half bad.
<SomethingDifferent> oh god I destroyed the fabric of this chatroom by posting kazooie's.
<SomethingDifferent> i hate myself
<Ivan2294> How?
<SilverSonic> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lPv6UoC_4E o-o
<Ivan2294> We always get derailed, if that's the problem

<Silverscreen> Not in the manner it was done, IMO, but whatever. They're your screenshots.
<Revolver> Do want.
<Ivan2294> We don't want to get bored of ponies.
<eurobeatBrony> Whoops! Back.
<eurobeatBrony> Hey Zeke.
<SomethingDifferent> http://kellywpa.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/banging-head-stick-man1.gif
<Silverscreen> 11I haven't gotten that far yet.
<twentypercentcooler> haha
<Ivan2294> Now that I think about it I did name Minecraft to be the second best game ever so....
<Fooby> That gif is more erotic than it has any right to be
<Ivan2294> Maybe my opinion isn't accurate
<eurobeatBrony> Minecraft is pretty awesome.
<eurobeatBrony> It's not so much a game as it is a toy with a loss-condition
<Revolver> It needs wrenches.
<MiddaySparkle> Minecraft is Lego on steroids
<twentypercentcooler> what is minecraft? some game of some sort?
<eurobeatBrony> But... whatever it is, it's AMAZING.
<User_2397> kk
<Silverscreen> 11I believe I"m at the part where I'm questioning the western ex-detective outside of the Evidence Room where the one murder took place.
<Revolver> So I can make TF2 jokes.
<Ghosties> 4Listen, I don't want to cause any trouble with any of you guys and I'm sorry if I upset you or Hipster
<eurobeatBrony> NEED A DISPENSER HERE
<Nightboomfer> I think if there's ever a MLPFIM movie, that's when the cutie mark crusaders will finally get their cutie marks
<Ivan2294> I stand by my decision that Banjo-Tooie is the best game of all time
<eurobeatBrony> MLPFIM movie.
<Ghosties> 4I don't feel comfortable with this situation
<eurobeatBrony> DIRECTED BY MICHAEL BAY
<Silverscreen> I just think that if the mod was being a douche, they should be called out on it, that's all.
<MiddaySparkle> agreed Night
<twentypercentcooler> MLPFIM movie, would be epic
<Revolver> Nightboomfer, this is true fax.
<twentypercentcooler> but this was brought up the other day
<twentypercentcooler> and
<Ivan2294> Agreed
<BlankFlankBrony> I second Night's idea.
<Silverscreen> Kinda the whole point of that thread.
<twentypercentcooler> its unlikely it would do well in theatres
<Ivan2294> TV Movie
<Ivan2294> Problem solved
<NewDCD> 9well
<eurobeatBrony> "THIS SUMMER.. ENTER A WORLD OF MAGIC UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN.
<BlankFlankBrony> Or direct-to-DVD
<Ghosties> 4I feel the exact same way about Scootaloo
<NewDCD> 9good thing I got to tell you before then
<MiddaySparkle> took the words out of my keyboard Ivan
<Ivan2294> THIS SUMMER DISCOVER THE MAGIC
<eurobeatBrony> STARRING MORGAN FREEMAN AS SPIKE
<twentypercentcooler> Direct to DVD would be epic
<Ivan2294> THAT TOUCHED THE LIVES OF MILLIONS
<Nightboomfer> eeyup
<Ivan2294> OF RANDOM INTERNET PEOPLE
<MiddaySparkle> nah D2DVD won't make as much of an impact
<eurobeatBrony> TARA STRONG AS TWILIGHT SPARKLE
<Ivan2294> THAT NO ONE CARES ABOUT
<twentypercentcooler> I can say, that I would go see it in a thaeatre
<twentypercentcooler> lol
<MiddaySparkle> same
<eurobeatBrony> AND MERYL STREEP AS CELSTIA
<MiddaySparkle> HAH
<eurobeatBrony> *DRAMATIC SOUND*
<Silverscreen> I haven't seen anything that chickenmod's done outside of moving into /rp/ so I can't say anything about that.
<Revolver> Whoa, capslock go!
<Nightboomfer> That way they can have a series finale, without messing up the whole "The series can be watched in any order" thing
<eurobeatBrony> *MLP theme plays dramatically*
<Ivan2294> I want a movie based on voice actors who appear in EVERYTHING
<MiddaySparkle> I can so see Meryl Streep as Celestia
<eurobeatBrony> "...MY LITTLE PONY. RATED PG."
<Silverscreen> 11Yep.
<Revolver> Morgan Freeman!
<Revolver> AWWW YEAAAAH
<Ivan2294> Nolan North and Tara Strong
<eurobeatBrony> Morgan Freeman as SPIKE.
<Fooby> Freemane*
<Ghosties> 4Then I really wish you had been here to see it
<SomethingDifferent> I want everyone to stand in the corner over there > http://kellywpa.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/banging-head-stick-man1.gif
<SillyNilly> John Wayne Gacy as Pinkie Pie
<Ivan2294> NO
<MiddaySparkle> Mareyl Streep?
<Nightboomfer> I just hope they don't do anything dumb like put humans in there for no reason
<SomethingDifferent> YES
<SomethingDifferent> YES
<Ivan2294> I REFUSE TO STAND IN A CORNER
<eurobeatBrony> Good Celestia, SillyNilly. D:
<eurobeatBrony> That's just messed.
<eurobeatBrony> ...you can't have a dead man in the studio!
<eurobeatBrony> How unsanitary~!
<SillyNilly> Undead, we use science to bring him to life!
<Ivan2294> Is it physically, magically, figuratively, or technically possible to make an official Human in Equestria story without it sucking?
<eurobeatBrony> ...you'd bring Gacy back to life?
<Nightboomfer> eeynope
<SillyNilly> *lightning bolt flashes in background, crack of thunder*
<MiddaySparkle> mmm... maybe... but it's an atomic chance
<Revolver> http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Pony18001.jpg
<Revolver> Whoops.
<Revolver> Meant to post that in Steam.
<Ivan2294> Lets see, play Arma 2 wiht a great community, or talk about ponies...
<Ivan2294> Ponies it is
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Ponies.
<BlankFlankBrony> lol
<SomethingDifferent> gz on spreading ponies thru steam
<eurobeatBrony> Get'cher priorities straight.
<MiddaySparkle> PONIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
<Lightning_Quickhoof> High Hoof, Ivan!
<twentypercentcooler> ponies its not a question
<SomethingDifferent> achievement UNLOcKED
<eurobeatBrony> Arma 2 will be there when you're done.
<eurobeatBrony> (WHICH IS NEVARRRR)
<BlankFlankBrony> lol
<Ivan2294> But PC Gamer's server wont be
<Ivan2294> That's the problem
<Ivan2294> Oh well
<SilverSonic> http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/20344 Ok this is amazing <3
<SomethingDifferent> Ach-Ach-Achievement UnLOcKED
<Ivan2294> I can always play the greatest FPS game of all time's sequel
<Revolver> Lies.
<Silverscreen> I have the strong opinion that if you're given a responsibility, you need to do the responsibility in a proffesional manner and leave your personal thoughs and opinions aside. The only exception to this is when said thoughts and opinions have a *positive* influence on said responsibility
<Ivan2294> Whenever it comes out
<Ghosties> 4Oh wait...there is a post that implies children
<Revolver> Oh wait.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> I don't know if I'll go to bed yet.
<Revolver> LIES.
<eurobeatBrony> Don't be silly Ivan.
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Maybe I'll start up my Desktop Ponies.
<eurobeatBrony> They'll never release
<Ghosties> 4The way how Hipster said it made it sound like he specifically said "everyone acts like children"
<SomethingDifferent> wb lightning
<eurobeatBrony> Team Fortress 3
<Ghosties> 4He didn't exactly say that though
*eurobeatBrony hits rimshot
<Revolver> Lies, for Gabe Newell put EP3 under a salad plate.
<Ivan2294> Ha, you misspelled Battlefield
<Nightboomfer> If everything can be improved by ponies, does that include movies that have starred Shaquille O'neill?
<Ghosties> 4He said "the majority of people here don't act like adults"
<Revolver> No.
<SomethingDifferent> you should get hypnotized if ur not tired enough. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTkyUNHBzMA
<eurobeatBrony> Some things... just can't be saved.
<SomethingDifferent> it repeats,
<Silverscreen> yeah. again, it was in response to Whelp, though, which might have influenced that comment.
<Revolver> TF2 is FAR better than BF2/3
<MiddaySparkle> Anything that starred Shaq can never be repaired
<Lightning_Quickhoof> If everything can be improbed by ponies, does that include Rebecca Black's Friday?
<Ivan2294> Eh
<eurobeatBrony> Y'know what was a good game?
<MiddaySparkle> TF2 is mindlessly fun
<Lightning_Quickhoof> improved*
<Nightboomfer> I am Kazaam!
<eurobeatBrony> Mechwarrior 2.
<Ivan2294> It depends on what you want and who you play with
<eurobeatBrony> And frickin' Ghost Bear.
<Nightboomfer> Shaq Fu?
<Silverscreen> But the manner it was stated in kinda ticked me off.
<SomethingDifferent> Ponies got Rebecca Black suspended.
<eurobeatBrony> That game was boss.
<Ivan2294> I prefer BF3 because of the immersive environment
<Light_Latias> 12aaaand finished the survey
<Roleplay4life> 5People still here? D:
<Revolver> I don't care.
<Ivan2294> TF2 can't do immersive, only fun
<Aurora> 6yes
*Light_Latias 12lols
<MiddaySparkle> true enough
<Light_Latias> 12in both of the boxes
<Ivan2294> And I have other games for that.
<Roleplay4life> 5Yay~ :3
<Light_Latias> 12I wrote them novels XD
<eurobeatBrony> I dunno if I'd WANT TF2 with a story.
<Ivan2294> Although i really should play TF2 more
<Ghosties> 4I didn't catch it before because I hadn't quite come under the assumption that it was !!Twilight possibly posting as Anonymous
<eurobeatBrony> That was sort of the point of the recent "Producer" comic they did, wasn't it?
<SomethingDifferent> TF2 = meh, cSS = meh, GmoD = no wai, Minecraft = YES
<Revolver> TF2 has a FAR better developing team that CARE about their playes.
<Revolver> *players
<Ghosties> 4I actually did save it though...if only because I felt he was correct
<eurobeatBrony> Producer's trying to make their lives all dramatic...
<Ivan2294> True
<SilverSonic> XD
<Light_Latias> 12"Why did you want OoT 3D?"
<Ivan2294> But it's not immersive
<MiddaySparkle> I'd play some more TF2 if I hadn't neglected logging on to Steam once in a while
<Lightning_Quickhoof> What about Terraria, SD?
<eurobeatBrony> "I. Like. To Shoot. Gun. Is all you need to know."
<Light_Latias> 12well...where do I begin?
<SilverSonic> lmao
<Light_Latias> 12X3
<Revolver> And, EP3 will be immersive as all get out.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;3
<HyperMetalLugia> Cute
<Ivan2294> Terria isn't FPS
<User_6686> I kinda like some of the fan theories surrounding TF2
<SomethingDifferent> Terraria is awsom too
<SomethingDifferent> SD, meh
<Light_Latias> 12tho
<Revolver> Gtg.
<Light_Latias> 12I didn't get explicit
<eurobeatBrony> Aw man, alright
<SilverSonic> well, im tempted to do a Zelda special next week o3o
<Revolver> See you guise tomorrow.
<eurobeatBrony> Ciao Revolver.
<Light_Latias> 12the worst I said
<Nightboomfer> bye
<Ghosties> 4No offense to anyone, but I seriously am telling you that we can't go one damn day without constant infighting and shit flinging at one another.
<SomethingDifferent> cya
<Balloons> Hello Everyone.
<Ivan2294> So who said something about Season 2 in 35 days?
<Revolver> Huzzah!
<Ivan2294> bye
<Lightning_Quickhoof> SD stands for SomethingDifferent, SomethingDifferent.
<Light_Latias> 12was that I saw adult Link on the N64 version and...
<eurobeatBrony> 35 days
<eurobeatBrony> wat
<SomethingDifferent> ...
<SomethingDifferent> I forgot
<Revolver> lolwut
<Roleplay4life> 5Oh gawd. xD;
<Light_Latias> 12and then I said something like "anyway..."
<Silverscreen> From what I've seen, The intellectual discussion to mudfest ratio is 50/50 in my eyes.
<BlankFlankBrony> It's Ivan; expect trolling.
<eurobeatBrony> Ah, I haven't been around these parts much
<Ivan2294> Someone said something about 2nd seasons being released two months later after season one on average
<Silverscreen> and everything in between is just random.
<Ivan2294> Also, I don't troll
<Light_Latias> 12:3
<SomethingDifferent> I'm tired. It's monday. Expect short-tem memory loss.
<Ivan2294> At least I don't think I do....
<Ivan2294> :/
<Ghosties> 4Perhaps I'm just more pessimistic than you are
<eurobeatBrony> Well, it's been a pleasure but I'm gonna jet
<eurobeatBrony> ...before I go, a little teasing:
<Silverscreen> Possible. I'm known to keep a positive view on things.
<BlankFlankBrony> Take care.
<Ivan2294> byez
<SomethingDifferent> ok goo night
<eurobeatBrony> Those of you in the know or in the right places
<SomethingDifferent> good*
<eurobeatBrony> won't see the last of me yet. ;3

<Ivan2294> They should make an episode called Super Ponybeat
<drf|laptop> 03sure you will
<SilverSonic> XD
<Ivan2294> Focused on Vinyl of course
<drf|laptop> 03I swear if I just hear LIIIIINK I'm leaivng
<drf|laptop> 03*leaving
<twentypercentcooler> oh nice
<SilverSonic> XD
<SilverSonic> LIIIIIIIIIIIIINK
<Silverscreen> It also goes to show that when I find something that _really_ gets under my skin, it's usually something bad.
<SomethingDifferent> they should make an episode focused on DJ PON-3
*SilverSonic RUNS
<Light_Latias> 12D:
<Ivan2294> Take some inspiration from the fans and use them remixes they made
<Light_Latias> 12LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINK <3
<Silverscreen> But I've been known to be wrong as well.
<Light_Latias> 12also
<SilverSonic> XD
<Light_Latias> 12when I said why I got it
<SillyNilly> Derpy episode please
<Ghosties> 4Trust me, if he had said those things to me I would have been all for knocking his ass down a notch
<Light_Latias> 12err
<Ghosties> 4But he didn't
<Light_Latias> 12what led up to getting it
<twentypercentcooler> Make a completely fan chosen scenario episode,
<twentypercentcooler> epic
<twentypercentcooler> EPIC aight.
<Ivan2294> I'm the type of person who likes background characters too much
<SomethingDifferent> Derpy episode, isn't that confirmed?
<Ghosties> 4And I'm viewing this from a third party; neutral, so I have to be unbiased
<SillyNilly> Not sure, is it?
<Ghosties> 4I am friends with you guys
<Nightboomfer> An episode where big Macintosh accidentally gets twilight Sparkle pregnant
<Fooby> Episodes focusing on background ponies can potentially destroy the personality assigned to her by the fandom
<twentypercentcooler> ...
<Ivan2294> As in, if the show suddenly stopped being about the mane cast I wouldn't notice.
<Ghosties> 4But I have my own morals
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Well, gonna go to bed nao; g'night.
<Silverscreen> Technically, I'm third party in this as well.
<Nightboomfer> night
<SomethingDifferent> nite'
<Light_Latias> 12I said "When I heard about it getting released on the 3DS, I bought the 3DS on release date(which happened to be my birthdate. Thank you Nintendo)
<Light_Latias> 12"
<twentypercentcooler> gnite
<Ivan2294> Boomfer wtf
<Light_Latias> 12oxo
<User_6686> Lyra and Bonbon need to remain in the background so I may continue assuming they're lesbians
<SomethingDifferent> thats what i tho
<SomethingDifferent> thought*
<Nightboomfer> <---Paraspriting
<Silverscreen> I didn't even know of the thread until Hipster posted a link when I came into chat.
<Nightboomfer> Trolololol
<Ivan2294> I prefer Lyra and BonBon as fwiends
<Ivan2294> Best Fwiends fowever
<twentypercentcooler> SWIENDS
<SilverSonic> o3o
<Light_Latias> 12tho I DID tell them about how unhappy I was with the editing of the game
<User_6686> Fwiends with benefits
<twentypercentcooler> F*
<twentypercentcooler> Fwiends*
<Fooby> 6686 has a point
<Light_Latias> 12and I poked both the blocks and the Fire Temple theme
<twentypercentcooler> Bwenifwits*
<Silverscreen> 11Well, I figured out how to work the mic on my Emulator. :D
<SomethingDifferent> Dcing sux
<Ivan2294> My wittle pwony Fwiendship is magi
<Ghosties> 4I guess so, but my empirical judgment is telling me that aside from his two actual mod posts he did nothing wrong because everything else is purely circumstantial and I shouldn't be biased towards it being !!Twilight who said it as anon.
<Ghosties> 4His anonymity, as I said earlier, saves him
<SomethingDifferent> thats not the way to spell it incorrectly
<Ivan2294> So if they did make a spinoff of the show, what would you want it to focus on.
<twentypercentcooler> hahaha
<Nightboomfer> I never really mean half the stuff I spout. I wish there were an easier way to convey sarcasm through a text based medium
<Ivan2294> Assuming you wanted a spinoff at all
<SomethingDifferent> its myh lil pwny: frndshp iz magi
<Nightboomfer> The cutie mark crusaders!
<Silverscreen> Probably why he switched to anon in the first place. Wanted to save face if somepony tried to use it against him.
<drfsupercenter> 03*WB02(Chimera02)03WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Ivan2294> ^
<User_6686> My Little Bronies
<Silverscreen> Wow, I've been playing Phoenix Wright too much. x.x I'm starting to think like an attorney.
<Ivan2294> Although some hated the All Grown-up spinoff of Rugrats I liked it
<User_6686> Big Mackintosh in the Big City
<twentypercentcooler> Twilwight Spwawkle, Wainbow Dwash, Pwinkie Pwie, FwutterSwhy, AppleJwack
<Ivan2294> And I would love a similarly styled CMC Spinoff
<twentypercentcooler> ah that fails
<mistasparkaru> luna... tons of luna
<Nightboomfer> would they still be blank flanks in the future?
<Jazza> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10906236/Pony/Characters/Appledash/rainbowapple_004.png
<Ivan2294> Nah
<SomethingDifferent> Twliht Sprkl, Rnbw Dsh, Pnki Pie, Fltrshy, Apljck
<twentypercentcooler> the heck? haha
<Ghosties> 4This entire discussion feels like a courtroom discussion
<Ivan2294> You know, I can't help but wonder
<Jazza> :3
<twentypercentcooler> Rrty
<SomethingDifferent> condensed
<Ghosties> 4Repetition >_<
<SomethingDifferent> cdnsd
<Silverscreen> I just noticed that too.
<Ivan2294> Since some kids shows DO have relationships
<twentypercentcooler> cndnsd spk fr th wn
<SomethingDifferent> rte m8
<Ivan2294> How long until they start doing relationships that "wing the other way"
<twentypercentcooler> relationships in mlp?
<Ivan2294> In kids shows
<Ivan2294> Not in MLP
<twentypercentcooler> that would be interesting
<Ghosties> 4In any case, I feel like I worded that last post wrong: I shouldn't be biased towards an anonymous post because it could have been anybody and not necessarily !!Twilight
<Ivan2294> But it happens in other kids shows
<Ghosties> 4But yes, he could have done it to save face
<Ivan2294> Like spongebob and Fairly Odd Parents
<Ghosties> 4If it was !!Twilight mod, in fact
<Ivan2294> Not all the time, but it's happened before
<SomethingDifferent> hw cn u Spk n ths lang
<twentypercentcooler> lng*
<twentypercentcooler> not lang*
<SomethingDifferent> dammit
<SillyNilly> My Little Consonant: Disemvoweling is Magic
<Ivan2294> lol
<User_6686> It would probably have to start with implied relationships
<Ivan2294> Or should I say LL
<User_6686> Although that's arguably already happened
<SillyNilly> LL
<Ivan2294> Like Bon-Bon and Lyra
<twentypercentcooler> Rainbow Dash/ Soarin, just sayin...
<Silverscreen> As I said though (repetition inbound), it had to at least been a mod based on what they said. But outside of that, you're right, we can't tell.
<Ivan2294> Where 6686?
<Light_Latias> 12wbs Chime
<Nightboomfer> Bloomberg x Bucket of turnips?
<SillyNilly> I'd like to see Lyra X Bench
<twentypercentcooler> HAHA
<User_6686> ...Ren and Stimpy?
<Ivan2294> LOLZ
<User_6686> I dunno
<Ivan2294> I doubt that
<Ivan2294> Although that isn't exactly the best example of a kids show
<Ivan2294> Awesome as it is, it was extreme for a kids show
<SilverSonic> Right, I'm tempted to make a half Special on RN next week, where most of the show, but not all of it is dedicated to OoT Music. Thoughts?
<User_6686> Spongebob and Patrick
<User_6686> Yeah I got nothin
<Ivan2294> Right....
<Ivan2294> But yeah, I think implied relationships would be the start
<Silverscreen> ....wow. I managed to think of the weather without thinking of pegasi ponies for the first time in weeks. XD
<Isukra> 12noooo
<Ivan2294> They've already gotten full-blown ones in movies and shows, although mostly stereotypical...
<Light_Latias> 12:D
<Ivan2294> *Adult shows
<SilverSonic> !Isukra
*Isukra now belongs to SilverSonic for 13 minutes
*Silverscreen has rain. :D

<SilverSonic> This is an amazing remastered version of this song
<Xiagu> they practiced a lot (by drawing stuff)
<SilverSonic> with actual vocals in this
<User_6686> You're not born with art skills, but you are born with the passion to pursue them
<Ghosties> Dari, are you there?
<Ghosties> 4Wait, you're probably asleep right now -_-
<twentypercentcooler> and that I do
<Ghosties> 4Oh well
<Isukra> 12!silversonic
<NotSpike> True that, man.
<Xiagu> Meh. It's still not a boolean though.
<NotSpike> Very deep...
<twentypercentcooler> whats been frustrating is the transition of pencil to tablet
<SilverSonic> Nup
<SilverSonic> Dont have a script sadly
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<twentypercentcooler> I haaate the tablet, It makes me feel so beginner again, and I cant get good lines and whatnot, it just feels awkward
<Jazza> You'll get used to it, me thinks
<Ivan2294> Okay I just read this on a post: Femanons who grew up with the original show argued with bronies, bronies lost. Shit was so cash it was actual currency. They like made the bronies wonder why they called themselves fans when there was so much lore they knew nothing about.
<Ivan2294> I honestly don't have any idea what this guy is talking about.....
<User_6686> I know brony fan lore
<SilverSonic> hm...if i do play Fire Temple on RN this week, do I play V1.0 or V1.2?

<SilverSonic> LL just beat what i just beat hours ago o3o
<Rust> Aha!
*Rust hugs Captainpinkiepie
<User_6686> Sounds like the gist of the post is that there was certain lore established in G1-G3 and the new G4 fans don't know any of it
*Light_Latias 12toasts eXAKR
<Rust> The first of my successful clones!
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Yea okay rust

<Ivan2294> If you were born in the early 90s you tend to view the shows you DID see as SACRED, and the shows you didn't as wtf why did people like this...
<SixSpeed> She also had Lisa Frank off-brand ponies.
<Ivan2294> Hence why i don't really care for most shows pre-1996
<twentypercentcooler> hmmm
<Ivan2294> Which sucks, because everytime I talk about 90s cartoons, half of them I don't care about and half of them I LOVE

<Shaico> "I miss you so much big sister"
<DerpyGrooves> D:
<Shaico> i mean the background music
<RandomlyWeir> Oh
<Chimera> Lolwow
<RandomlyWeir> well
<RandomlyWeir> pilot is pilot
<PsychicKid> seriously I kinda was hoping for the rest of the season to be as awesome as the pilot
<DerpyGrooves> Now she has all this baggage of being some crazy abacus-loving antisocial wingy twilight sparkle clone
<Shaico> recently listen to ep1 and 2 background track only
<Shaico> wow
<RandomlyWeir> hah
<SixSpeed> Dat abacus
<PsychicKid> abacus
<RandomlyWeir> shaico, where is it?
<PsychicKid> what
<[zZz]ekeS> PsychicKid: go read Progress (aka Luna Vs.)
<[zZz]ekeS> nao
<PsychicKid> no, fanfics are horrible
<SilverSonic> CRAP, Im at the part where i need more weight to push a button down
<RandomlyWeir> I liked portal fanfic
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<SilverSonic> but where do i find the extra weight o-o
<DerpyGrooves> I sort of wish the rest of the series had gone off the whole magic girl formula
<Shaico> RandomlyWier: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj0lwIZTyso
<DerpyGrooves> BTW GASP!!!
<Light_Latias> 12Ruto :P
<SilverSonic> OH
<Prominence> I'm liking the slice of life, honestly.
<Light_Latias> 12Princess Fishy
<SilverSonic> That silly fishy
<Light_Latias> 12gawd
<SixSpeed> I dig it.
<SilverSonic> girl thing
<PsychicKid> I like slice of life but I liked the pilot stuff too
<Light_Latias> 12even SHE wants a piece of my Hylian D:<

<DerpyGrooves> I heard season 2 is gonna have a recurring antagonist introduced, so maybe they're trying to push things back in the magic girl direction
<Shaico> magic girl?
<DerpyGrooves> lyra+bonbon is best ship
<PsychicKid> Shaico
<Shaico> hm?
<DerpyGrooves> It's the genre where it's a bunch of magic girls who fight a monster a week. Like Sailor moon
<PsychicKid> you saw how the ponies used magic to own the fuck out of nightmare right
<SilverSonic> lmfao
<PsychicKid> what derpy said
<RandomlyWeir> oh
<User_6207> mahou shoujo >_>;
<Shaico> lol awesome
<RandomlyWeir> Well
<PsychicKid> not all magical girl is like that though
<DerpyGrooves> That's what my mom calls it (She's japanese)
<PsychicKid> ojamajo doremi has like no fighting lol
<Shaico> magic filly u mean then
<RandomlyWeir> MAgical Poni
<PsychicKid> probably because mahou shoujo means magical girl
<DerpyGrooves> ding!
<Nightmare_Moon> I got attacked by rainbows -.=.- wouldn't you hide your face in shame after that, never wanting to be seen again?
<[zZz]ekeS> Magical girl?
<SixSpeed> You didn't get attacked...you got BEAT by rainbows.
<[zZz]ekeS> You guys should go watch Puella Magi Madoka Magica :p
<Nightmare_Moon> twice
<Shaico> Magical Girl, like Sailor Moon
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Does anyone have a xbox?
<OhYeaPinkiePie> plz
<Fooby> I do.
<Fooby> Does yours work yet? :P
<Shaico> me too
<DerpyGrooves> btw do you ever imagine an alternate universe where Pound Puppies or Strawberry shortcake had gotten popular instead of MLP?
<OhYeaPinkiePie> yes
<SixSpeed> I shudder at the thought.
<Nightmare_Moon> Secret Butt Fun
<Shaico> ....
<PsychicKid> no
<Shaico> ::S
<DerpyGrooves> It always creeps me out
<PsychicKid> Nightmare_Moon I heard that as Secret Butt Fund
<OhYeaPinkiePie> i got it working
<[zZz]ekeS> Shaico: would you like to make a contract? :3
<Shaico> Strawberry Shortcakes got the most fucked up eyes
<Shaico> huh what contract?
<SixSpeed> And the worst 'animation'
<DerpyGrooves> What if faust had done shortcake, tho?
<RandomlyWeir> Why did lauren faust quit?
<Shaico> contract with the devil?
<DerpyGrooves> and made it ironic and hilarious?
<SixSpeed> It reminds me of Big Forehead Russian Kids.
<User_6207> I never thought I'd see grown men buying girl toys, but anything can happen. o.o
<PsychicKid> >he thinks this is a new thing
<[zZz]ekeS> Shaico: go watch Madoka
<[zZz]ekeS> :p
<BlankFlankBrony> laaaaaaaaaaagzilla
<DerpyGrooves> The greatest ever magical girl show is panty and stocking
<SixSpeed> Oh yes.
<Shaico> i don't watch anime
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Fooby what is your Gtag?
<DerpyGrooves> It's japanese powerpuff girls, and it's weird
<RandomlyWeir> lol
<SixSpeed> It's not just weird.
<SillyNilly> It is a parody of anime
<PsychicKid> japanese powerpuff girls is ppgz
<SixSpeed> It's /fantastical/
<SillyNilly> In anime format
<RandomlyWeir> Its a REMAKE
<rememberme> pinkypie would make a graet mad hatter
<Shaico> PPGZ IS HORRIBLE
<[zZz]ekeS> DerpyGrooves: thats not really a mg show :p
<User_6207> Anything directed by Shinbou Akiyuki is good. ;x
<RandomlyWeir> and a bad one
<PsychicKid> panty and stocking makes fun of anime and western cartoons
<Shaico> SO
<Shaico> HORRIBLE
<[zZz]ekeS> m a d o k a
<DerpyGrooves> Close enough, maybe?
<PsychicKid> my group subbed PPGZ for like 5 episodes
<PsychicKid> then it got licensed
<Fooby> OhYeaPinkiePie: You don't remember from a couple nights ago? DL:
<Fooby> D:*
<RandomlyWeir> It was in spain for a while
<OhYeaPinkiePie> sorry
<DerpyGrooves> It's to magical girl what Sayonara, Zetsubou Sensei is to harem comedy
<SixSpeed> The tachikomas are singing.
<OhYeaPinkiePie> what is it?
<SilverSonic> ;_; how do i get her in that room, its near impossible
<rememberme> rarety a grate duchus and twilight a grate catterpiller
<RandomlyWeir> BAi, G2g
<User_6207> Maria Holic was brilliant, the man can definitely direct.
<OhYeaPinkiePie> Fooby Booby?
<OhYeaPinkiePie> ?
<Fooby> ClawfulFelidae
<Fooby> I'll hop on Red Dead later tonight, if you're awake ;P
<Fooby> :P*
<OhYeaPinkiePie> there
<DerpyGrooves> Okay so a pony comes up to you
<DerpyGrooves> what do you do
<SixSpeed> Brohoof.
<Fooby> My brother's on Netflix right now, so I can't play yet :x
<SixSpeed> ...and then poke it to find out what the hell it's made of.
<DerpyGrooves> Okay it turns out it's actually made out of whatever sort of plastic that the figures are made out of
<DerpyGrooves> So it's not super snuggleable
<SixSpeed> That is EXACTLY what I imagine it to be.
<SixSpeed> I would protect my ice cream sandwiches...
<SixSpeed> I had an incisdent with a horse and an ice cream sandwich.
<[zZz]ekeS> then how would it be flexible?
<DerpyGrooves> The figures are bendy-ish
<SixSpeed> And they are probably warm.
<SixSpeed> So, more maleable.
<Retsamoreh> Guys I stabbed myself with a compass. help
<SixSpeed> Got super glue, Retsamoreh?
<DerpyGrooves> Suckville. Where/how deep?
<DerpyGrooves> btw none of us are doctors
<Retsamoreh> thats lame
<DerpyGrooves> except for doctor whooves
<SillyNilly> First aid kit. Get to it pronto.
<PaintSplash> Evening everypony.
<SixSpeed> No, seriously, super glue.
<DerpyGrooves> howdy splash
<SixSpeed> Super glue is made for this.
<SillyNilly> Hi PaintSplash
<Retsamoreh> I just needed a bandaid.
<BlankFlankBrony> Greetings Fireant
<Retsamoreh> You act like I stabbed it all the way through my bone.
<SixSpeed> Well.
<SixSpeed> "stabbed" can be taken many ways.
<SillyNilly> *shrugs*
<Fireant> Bonżur.
<SillyNilly> No way I can interpret the nature of your condition
<SixSpeed> Like I "stabbed" my hand with a knife and it almost went all the way through. Sliced the tendon that controls my thumb.
<Retsamoreh> You too?
<PaintSplash> Ouch.
<SixSpeed> Did that in 2006. Hurts every know and then.
<DerpyGrooves> ouchie!
<Retsamoreh> No bloody way. Same year, even.
<SixSpeed> ...but they fixed it with superglue.
<PaintSplash> A friend of mine slit thier hand open a while back coring apples....luckily no tendon damage
<SillyNilly> Ouchy
<Retsamoreh> Got mine carving a pumpkin.
<SixSpeed> Tendon healed nicely.
<SixSpeed> DerpyGrooves, are you on here via the website?
<Light_Latias> 12carry her into it?
<Light_Latias> 12<late>
<Retsamoreh> Oh, good for you. I guess.
<DerpyGrooves> aye that is the case
<SixSpeed> Damn. Alright hold on.
<SilverSonic> i did
<SilverSonic> but what am i suppsed to do with her, carry her out of the fish?
<SixSpeed> DerpyGrooves, http://img815.imageshack.us/img815/8587/tracyart.jpg
<BlankFlankBrony> Nice.
<DerpyGrooves> that is too ungodly cute
<SixSpeed> Note the double monocles.
<DerpyGrooves> Tracy is an insane talent
<DerpyGrooves> yeah it took me a second to realize it wasn't glasses lol
<SixSpeed> Yeah she is. She's also just fun to hang around.
<SixSpeed> I had to watch the dealer's den for a while, and chatted with her.
<SixSpeed> She puts on this very professional exterior, but you don't have to dig far to understand how goofy she is, a lot like her comic.
<DerpyGrooves> Well you can just tell she's brilliant from her writing
<SixSpeed> Oh yes.
<DerpyGrooves> Like, that one poem she did for Dithyramb
<DerpyGrooves> I still have it memorized because it's really, really good
<SixSpeed> Remind me?
<DerpyGrooves> http://lackadaisy.foxprints.com/comic.php?comicid=14
<SixSpeed> Oh wow, that's from a while ago.
<SixSpeed> The only two webcomics I actually care something about are Lackadaisy and Skin Deep. Everything else is kinda on the wayside.
<SilverSonic> bahh, im gonna take a short break on the game
<Sir> Oh hai
<SixSpeed> H-
<DerpyGrooves> I dig chainsawsuit
<SilverSonic> By..playing some OoT Music, maybe on a livestream >.>
<SilverSonic> or maybe not XD'
<DerpyGrooves> And nedroid is pretty funny
<DerpyGrooves> I also used to be into MSPaintAdventures but it just turned into such an insane clusterbuck I lost track
<BlankFlankBrony> I thought I recognized the art style...
<SixSpeed> Oh THANK you.
<SilverSonic> Ooh
*BlankFlankBrony is multitabbing; reaction time is slow
<SixSpeed> My gf (the wolf in that pic I linked :P) tried to get me into MSPA, but once the trolls showed up I kinda just don't care.
<Xiagu> I have been slacking on reading my webcomics :(
<SixSpeed> I've got a feed to Lackadaisy on my homepage. :P
<SixSpeed> Never missin' a beat.
<Xiagu> I use Piperka to manage mine
<BlankFlankBrony> Xiagu: Same here, for several of them, but I -do- have an excuse.
<Xiagu> Oh really? An excuse? Let's hear it.
<BlankFlankBrony> I have WAY too many webcomics that I like...
<BlankFlankBrony> Say, one or two... hundred. ^^;
<Xiagu> o____o
<SixSpeed> Whoa.
*Xiagu only reads 22
*BlankFlankBrony is a readaholic
<PaintSplash> I follow several comics. My interest kind of fades in stuff though when the artist goes into long space with no work.
<rememberme> fluttershy would look cute in an alice maddnes retuns dress dont you think
<BlankFlankBrony> *nods* Same here, PaintSplash.
<Flutterbro> Fluttershy is cute in anything
<BlankFlankBrony> Agreed.
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<PaintSplash> I dropped off reading VG cats a long time ago because he ceased updating for months at a time.
*BlankFlankBrony nods
<SilverSonic> o-o
<PaintSplash> Anyone read "Sequential Art"?
*SilverSonic might hop on livestream again o3o
<Xiagu> I do
<Fooby> I do whenever someone links me to it
<Fooby> I should get around to starting from the beginning ._.
<Xiagu> it recently went into one of its plot tumor arcs again
<Shaico> well hi again
<PaintSplash> That is something with that comic...these arcs happen that don't really do anything overall.
<Prominence> Hey.
<PaintSplash> Still...I am a fan of his style.
<Prominence> ...
*BlankFlankBrony tabs back in
<BlankFlankBrony> Yeah, SA is one that I keep my eye on.
<Xiagu> sorry, you guys make me go catch up on webcomics :P
<Flutterbro|Zzz> [22:59:33] <PaintSplash> Anyone read "Sequential Art"?
<Flutterbro|Zzz> welp
<Flutterbro|Zzz> now I have to read 700~ pages
<Flutterbro|Zzz> THANK YOU
<Flutterbro|Zzz> :|
<Prominence> I'll just leave this here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSlnZxvi37s
<Xiagu> Flutterbro|Zzz: it's joke-a-day except when it's not!
<SixSpeed> I guess I'll have to start playing fighting games now.
<Steve> 12 Hello, Aristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<SixSpeed> BRB donut or cookie run.
<DerpyGrooves> btw if anypony around here ever has some free time, you should read qwantz
<Fooby> Wait.
<Fooby> Is this
<DerpyGrooves> funniest webcomic maybe ever
<SilverSonic> http://www.livestream.com/silversonicsmusichour
<PaintSplash> whiich one?
<Fooby> Gameplay video, oh god there's actually progress.
<Flutterbro|Zzz> qwantz is too repetitive imo
<Fooby> THANK YOU PROMINENCE
<DerpyGrooves> that's the poin!t
<DerpyGrooves> OMG FIGHTING GAME OMG
<Xiagu> qwantz = Dinosaur Comics
<DerpyGrooves> YEAH
<DerpyGrooves> *yeah
<Prominence> Makes me happy to be able to actually say 'We weren't joking.'
<Prominence> And back it up.
<PaintSplash> I make a webcomic...but I'm not really keen on sharing it with all these other great comic names...
<Fooby> I should browse ponychan more often x.x
<Fooby> Starting with your ponychan thread.
<PaintSplash> also, I have more than one artist name...so I don't like them linked...
<PaintSplash> Kinda fun having more than one pen name
<Xiagu> none of the Hark! A Vagrant comics on ponychan are tagged well >:|
<DerpyGrooves> okay so I think we can all agree pinkiedash is canon
<Fooby> *cough*
<DerpyGrooves> oh, sorry
<DerpyGrooves> rainbowpie
<Fooby> ( _ _)
<Xiagu> ....there's a difference?
<BlankFlankBrony> Going to call it a night. Take care, all!
<PaintSplash> Does sound like an amazing desert.
<PaintSplash> night
<Dashie|Semi-AFK> Goodnight Blank!
<SixSpeed> Mmm Zingers.
<Xiagu> aha excellent. http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/4447?search=kate_beaton
<DerpyGrooves> okay everypony. Unshorn fetlocks y.n
<SixSpeed> Hmm.
<SixSpeed> Depends.
<SixSpeed> PERSONALLY I don't see how plasticy ponies would have them.
<Xiagu> yeah I don't really get that either
<SixSpeed> *I* keep mine in check. *huff*
<PaintSplash> its quite quiet.
<SixSpeed> It is.
<SixSpeed> I'm ok with this though.
<SixSpeed> Because it's really hard to type with boxing gloves on hooves.
<Xiagu> i see what you did there
<SixSpeed> Heheh.
<SixSpeed> jdsfijkafirikjrfiurfiueraijkeierijarejiaijarggnhu
<Xiagu> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/23828 :D
<Fooby> WIN
<Fooby> Xiagu, that is WIN WIN WIN WIN WIN.
<SixSpeed> Haha
<PaintSplash> lol
<SixSpeed> That is great.
<Fooby> I used to love H*R
<SixSpeed> I still do.
<DerpyGrooves> Homestar hasn't done anything for like a year
<DerpyGrooves> But I still keep an eye on HRwiki
<Fooby> I haven't been there in ages.
<SixSpeed> I still wear my The Cheat hoodie in the cooler months.
<SixSpeed> It's a bit beat to hell, and people still ask why I have a Pikachu on my shirt, but eh.
<DerpyGrooves> My fantasy is that the bros chaps are in talks w. cartoon network to start a show
<SixSpeed> I hope.
<DerpyGrooves> With Regular show saying crap and adventure time, an internet cartoon getting a show
<DerpyGrooves> I'd say the environment is pretty rececptive
<DerpyGrooves> btw http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/26171
<Fooby> Oh god.
<Fooby> A comic about that thread Seth posted about last night?
<DerpyGrooves> People got crazy pissed about that thread
<DerpyGrooves> yeah lmao
<SixSpeed> Which thread? This shit's loading slow.
<Fooby> Crazy-pissed?
<Fooby> Oh god, what happened when I stopped reading?
<SixSpeed> Hahaha
<PaintSplash> wait...what happened?
<Xiagu> it's a split between "love and tolerance" vs "kill the crazy bitch"
<DerpyGrooves> btw it turns out she didn't actually throw it away
<SixSpeed> wwaaat
<Fooby> ...
<Fooby> Oh dear.
<DerpyGrooves> She gave it to the little girl she takes care of in her spare time
<SixSpeed> Not sure if that makes up for it.
<Fooby> I can't believe people were suggesting "kill her"
<Fooby> Eugh...
<Fooby> Well, that's the internet.
<DerpyGrooves> Yeah it's sort of the same thing, but at least the girl is having fun
<DerpyGrooves> yeah lol little bit of an overreaction
<[zZz]ekeS> wait what happened?
<Xiagu> where'd you get that info?
<Fooby> Someone on ponychan posted about how his mom threw out his Rarity Brushable.
<Fooby> People started talking about it all.
<[zZz]ekeS> oh god
<SixSpeed> It was pretty silly.
<PaintSplash> What did he/she do to get it taken away?
<SixSpeed> Nothing, aside from buying it.
<Xiagu> nothing
<Ali1017> it's the EqD topic change, you surprized?
<Fooby> "Oh, I threw it away. It's garbage."
<Disk> I have a query. How many pony minecraft servers are there now?
<SixSpeed> Thousands upon thousands.
<Disk> s/many/many known/
<PaintSplash> Nice to assume something is just garbage...
<B-Man> The lost Rarity.
<B-Man> For shame.
<SixSpeed> I can't understand why you'd do that to your kid.
<Fooby> Parents do silly things.
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Light_Latias02)03WB* - <Light_Latias> 12Chaos, panic, and disorder. My work here is done~

<Retsamoreh_Reading> Oh okay.
<SilverSonic> LL how far did you get on OoT3D?
<Zeff> Not enough bronies on Omegle

<FlutterBro> hello?

<Zeff> Rawr Flutterbro
<FlutterBro> Apperantly someone has my username here
<Unidentified48450> also btw
<Unidentified48450> im new
<Unidentified48450> what
<Unidentified48450> the
<Unidentified48450> are you kidding?
<Mara> me too
<Unidentified48450> i thought i only had FlutterBro
<OriginalFlutterBro> there
<Mara> So why are you guys fans of FiM?
<OriginalFlutterBro> anyways i'm new
<drf|away> 03*WB02(eXAKR02)03WB* - <eXAKR> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon-Punching bendy buses!
<Outline> Hard to say Mara.
<Ali1017> watch the episodes, enjoy ponies
<Light_Latias> SS
<SixSpeed> Like ponies. Fun show.
<SixSpeed> Good fanbase.
<Light_Latias> I beat Dodongos Cavern
<SilverSonic> ah okies
<Light_Latias> and nao Im after Bottles and Hearts and upgrades etc
<SilverSonic> k
<Outline> I'm pretty sure "reasons to like FiM" have been compiled elsewhere on the internet, by peoplewho have a better understanding than I about what makes a show good.
<SilverSonic> hmm...i change my mind, im gonna try to beat this belly level
<SilverSonic> .v.
<Light_Latias> lol
<SilverSonic> *opens guide* >.>
<Light_Latias> fail
<SilverSonic> x.x
<SilverSonic> I know.
<SilverSonic> im stuck at a part
<Outline> But the basic rundown: Good animation, likable and well-rounded characters, not dripping with overt stupidity like most other television these days,
<Light_Latias> XD
<Xiagu> "Why can't I stop watching this"-ness
<SilverSonic> this princess in this level is a pain .-.
<Light_Latias> oh dont worry
<SixSpeed> Characters with character.
<Maren> I mean I guess its okay for a kids show and all, and I like some of the characters but I feel like the setting's kinda bland atm.
<Light_Latias> shes gone the second half :3
<SilverSonic> yay
<Balloons> it's only been one season. they need more time to develop it i think.
<SilverSonic> then link wont end up hitting on her .-.
*SilverSonic RUNS
<Outline> Agreeing with Balloons there.
<Light_Latias> xx
<Outline> But it's had about as good a start as one could hope for.
<SilverSonic> Ok, im in a room with what looks like a long thingy that hangs down
<SilverSonic> what do i do XD
<Outline> I think most of the reason to stick with the show comes from the fanbase.
<Flutter_Bro> any admins here?
<Balloons> Nope.
<Flutter_Bro> lol
<Light_Latias> boomerang
<Outline> Sorry.
<Fly> Oh sure. This fanbase will never die.
<Flutter_Bro> can you tell me about this chat server?
<Light_Latias> etc
<SilverSonic> im trying that
<[zZz]ekeS> Flutter_Bro: irc.lightirc.com
<Flutter_Bro> i never used a IRC
<Outline> Ehh... the fanbase might die, but at least in it's lifespan it's produced some brilliant fics and artworks.
<Maren> True, its only been a season, but I feel like the eps are kinda predictable. I mean, don't get me wrong I'm not saying I hate it, but at the same time I'm not sure you could consider me a fan either
<Light_Latias> target it
<[zZz]ekeS> Maren: you care enough to come here and chat at least :p
<SilverSonic> Thanks!
<SilverSonic> that helped xD
<Light_Latias> XD
<Fly> Hoo boy. I doubt it. If you compare it to anything else that's had as much hype as this, there will always be those hardcore fans keeping the fandom well and alive
<Outline> That's fair Maren. And you're right about the show being predictable.
<Flutter_Bro> is Username ownership permnament?
<SilverSonic> yay i beat that long thingy
<Flutter_Bro> Pernament
*Light_Latias goes after the last Bomb upgrade
<Outline> There's just something likable about the whole thing. Can't quite define it.
<[zZz]ekeS> Flutter_Bro: yes
<[zZz]ekeS> unless they inactivity timeout
<Light_Latias> Parasitic Tentacle?
<Flutter_Bro> oh
<Flutter_Bro> oh
<SilverSonic> yeah XD
<SilverSonic> i have a horrible way of describing things XD
<Fly> I've only seen about five episodes and found it to be predictable, too. I'm having a hard time getting myself to wathc more because of that
<[zZz]ekeS> I think lightirc's nickserv clears 30d inactives
<Flutter_Bro> so it's not permanent
<Light_Latias> btw
<Flutter_Bro> just until they leave
<SixSpeed> Yes.
<Light_Latias> 3 more of those ;3
<Jazza> Yes it's predictable, but so is a lot of TV shows and films
<Jazza> You still watch them though
<SilverSonic> oh lord
<Light_Latias> or is it 2?
<[zZz]ekeS> party of one ftw
<SixSpeed> You can register a nick to an email.
<Maren> I'm just trying to understand the fanbase better atm
<Light_Latias> 2 or 3
<Flutter_Bro> how
<Fly> Speak for yourself. I can't stand watching any predictable shows
<Jazza> What's there to understand? We are fans of the show and we group together at these fansites
<PaintSplash> Well...you tried the show, so fair enough...
<Outline> To each his own.
<SixSpeed> -> /msg nickserv REGISTER password email
<PaintSplash> @Outline well said.
<Maren> And yeah, some shows are predictable, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that most of the time I can tell how the story's going to unravel in 2-5 minutes.
<Flutter_Bro> how do i link my mail to a username?
<Flutter_Bro> oh
<SilverSonic> I GOT THE COMPASS :D
<Jazza> Maren personally I enjoy the characters and setting over plot
<Jazza> Definitely the characters

<drf|laptop> 03Now Sega Gets Hacked Too - 1.29 Million Customer Details Leaked
<drf|laptop> 03Sega is the latest company to face the wrath of hackers, as 1.29 million customer details were leaked.
<drf|laptop> 03While no credit card information was stolen this time, unlike the 100 million user data leak experienced by Sony, many other user details were stolen, including full names, birthdays, email addresses and passwords. The taken passwords were encrypted, however.
<drf|laptop> 03The data were stored on the Sega Pass website, a service Sega set up to provide new product information for registered customers.
<drf|laptop> 03Sega has already launched a full investigation of the matter, and will provide more details regarding the hack when details emerge.
<drf|laptop> 03No group has yet taken responsibility for the incident, but hacking group LulzSec, in the news recently for hacking a series of high profile targets including Sony Pictures, PBS and even the official website of the US Senate, seems to have denied being responsible for this latest attack, and have even offered help to Sega to track down those responsible. "We want to help you destroy the hackers that attacked you. We

<Light_Latias> nini Danny
*eXAKR hides
<drf|away> 03I saw that
<Ascendant> eXAKR
<drf|away> 03and you're no better since you're hating me
<SixSpeed> You could participate in some form of commerce.
<Mimezinga> i mean, just going around on 4 hooves could grow kinda boring after some minutes....
*Isukra perches on eXAKR
<eXAKR> You are the one who started the whole mess
<Light_Latias> shut it eXAKR
<Ascendant> If you want people to stop hating on you
<SixSpeed> Kinda.
<Ascendant> Then stop hating on other people
<Ascendant> same goes for drf, although he doesn't exactly hate on other people
<eXAKR> Take that and rub it in his face first
<Ascendant> ;p
<drf|away> 03How do you know I started it? Were you there when I first joined TST? I don't think so, I've been here a lot longer than you so shut up
<Mimezinga> no events, no GMs that make things happen?
<SixSpeed> I joined SL in 2005 and still pop on from time to time.
<SixSpeed> No.
<eXAKR> If Arti sees this, what will she think?
<drf|away> 03and no, I don't hate people, only things
<drf|away> 03until an iPod can get up and tell me I hurt its feelings
<SixSpeed> Imagine this chat in 3D with the ability to build buildings and change your avatar into anything.
<drf|away> 03I honestly don't care
<Mimezinga> mh, dunno, not my genre... i'm more story oriented when i RP
<SixSpeed> And if you purchase in-game currency, you can buy things.
<Ascendant> Threatening isn't going to help your case :|
<SixSpeed> Oh, you could set up a story RP.
<Isukra> 12drf you would love this coffee place across the street from the hobby shop
<SixSpeed> Gotta get participants.
<SixSpeed> And you gotta keep out griefers.
<eXAKR> I can't stand both Apple bashers and fanboys
<Isukra> 12i couldn't go on their network with my ipod or my linux computer
<Isukra> 12only windows
<Mimezinga> as usual
<drf|away> 03LOL
<Isukra> 12i finally said "you know what... no shirt, no shoes, no microsoft, no service"
<Ascendant> eXAKR, then /ignore drf
<eXAKR> I hate new Pokémon gen bashers
<SixSpeed> Keeping out griefers is half the fun of SL.
<drf|away> 03well I hate basher bashers
<SixSpeed> That and flying around in submarines.
<SilverSonic> LL i found the faries, was i supposed to grab all of them?
*Light_Latias faceclaws
<Isukra> 12you know what
<Mimezinga> pegasi fly?
<Isukra> 12if you both kept your opinions to yourself
<Mimezinga> in SL
<Light_Latias> no, just 3
<SixSpeed> Everyone flies.
<SilverSonic> Oh
<eXAKR> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/169/2/9/the_grasshole_show_7_by_yattarosb-d3j7oed.png
<drf|away> 03that was actually accidental
<Isukra> 12if you both kept your opinions to yourself, this wouldn't happen
<SilverSonic> *facepalms*
<Ascendant> if you can't tolerate someone then just /ignore someone, eXAKR
<Ascendant> if you don't want to, too bad
<SixSpeed> Flying is just a way to get around in SL.
<Light_Latias> the rest can heal u
<Mimezinga> O-o
<Ascendant> just put up with it
<SixSpeed> Everyone can do it.
<Mimezinga> ok
<eXAKR> You know
<AppleKhorne> Someponies bounce.
<Ascendant> arguing isn't going to help anything, lol
<eXAKR> You are an ADULT
<SixSpeed> You can get vehicles to fly around in.
<Light_Latias> they respawn
<drf|away> 03eXAKR, I don't whine about you unless you start randomly harassing me
<eXAKR> an ADULT that HATES A CHILDREN'S GAME
<SixSpeed> Can mock up battles in X-Wings.
<drf|away> 03so in this case, YOU are starting it
<drf|away> 03I don't hate the games
<drf|away> 03I play White daily
<drf|away> 03I hate the creatures
<eXAKR> And A CHILDREN'S CARTOON that is enjoyed by ADULTS
<SixSpeed> Some even have scripted damage and blow up.
<Ascendant> eXAKR, why don't you shut your mouth before it gets you into trouble? You're actually starting to annoying me.
<drf|away> 03adults who try to steal money from the government so they can sit at home being stupid
<eXAKR> Ascendant, PM
<Ascendant> k
<Mimezinga> mh.... ok, i think i got the genre of gaming
<Mimezinga> thanks
<Mimezinga> not sure if wants, i'll see
<Mimezinga> cya
<SixSpeed> Heh, there really isn't a "genre" to SL.
<SixSpeed> Adios.
<SilverSonic> LL i only grabbed 3, would they pop up in my inventory or is it automatic for healing?
<Light_Latias> are they in bottles?
<SilverSonic> .-.
<SilverSonic> CRAP
<Light_Latias> if not, theyre gone
<SilverSonic> bloody hell.
<Light_Latias> leave the pool then return
<Fooby> MMO?
<Light_Latias> they respawn
<SilverSonic> i dont have a bottle tho
<SilverSonic> thats why i said bloody hell.
<Light_Latias> catch one in...
<SilverSonic> a milk bottle?
<Light_Latias> you HAVE to
<Light_Latias> yes
<SixSpeed> MMO kinda implies an objective.
<Light_Latias> drink the milk
<Light_Latias> then use the bottle to catch a fairy
<drf|away> 03also, eXAKR, you claim it's always me who starts these things
<SilverSonic> i got a fairy
<drf|away> 03<eXAKR> Yay the hater is gone <- explain why that was necessary, then
<drf|away> 03that was just throwing fuel on the fire, and I will not fight unless I'm defending myself in which case I"ll fight back.
<Light_Latias> same goes with however many bottles you have
<Ascendant> I think he's trying to put you on ignore :x
<SilverSonic> k
<Light_Latias> Danny
<Isukra> 12drf
<Isukra> 12i would probably say the same thing
<Light_Latias> go to bed
<Isukra> 12but you know i only say it to be funny right?
<Light_Latias> plz x.x
<Fooby> MMORPG would.
<drf|away> 03but if I leave, that lets him win :|}
<drf|away> 03-}
<Light_Latias> no
<Fooby> But MMO just means that it's a game where a lot of people are on it
<Ascendant> sometimes you have to lose
<Fooby> I guess.
<ST_Falcon> it's essentially 'stupid internet bullshit' now with visuals
<Isukra> 12i never mean any offense to anyone
*eXAKR just puts a Snivy and Nightmare Moon plush in his place and scampers away
<Ascendant> and it's not necessarily letting him win
<Light_Latias> thats you needing to go
<ST_Falcon> with all the good and bad that comes with it
<Isukra> 12although i probably get close to that border everyday x-x
<Light_Latias> BOTH of you are being immature
<Ascendant> I wanna kill altair
<drf|away> 03LOL
<drf|away> 03anyway
<Light_Latias> typical boys, so I cant say Im suprised :/
<drf|away> 03DVD's done burning and it looks like eXAKR ragequit on me, so, I guess I'll go to bed now
<Isukra> 12Light_Latias i'm a boy
<Light_Latias> I know
<drf|away> 03but seriously, I only ever bash products, not people, I really don't *hate* anyone - but if someone just starts saying crap about me you can't expect me to sit there and watch calmly
<Light_Latias> but Im talking about eXAKR and Danny
<SilverSonic> I only have 2 bottles, i think that will hopefully do for now
<Isukra> 12well they aren't the only boys in the universe
<Light_Latias> kay
<Light_Latias> yes
<Isukra> 12ZXDDD
<Light_Latias> I know
<Isukra> 12i thought SilverSonic was talking about eXAKR and drf for a second
<Light_Latias> SS
<Isukra> 122 baby bottles for both of them
<Ascendant> drf, it's pride
<Ascendant> everyone has it ;p
<SilverSonic> .-. No Umbreon
<Ascendant> I know I do
<Isukra> 12XDDD
<Isukra> 12i fail so much XDD
<Light_Latias> they will revive you when you die
<SilverSonic> not really
<SilverSonic> im just apparently talking within an arguement
<Light_Latias> so keep them in your inventory
<SilverSonic> thanks LL
<drf|away> 03anyway
<SilverSonic> i will
<drf|away> 03oww, my head hurts, because I'm sunburned
<Isukra> 12i never even noticed the argument start
<Light_Latias> good luck
<drf|away> 03so with that good night everyone >_> and if more crap goes on behind my back let me know please

<Fireant> Like 3-4 max
<Light_Latias> :3
<Fireant> I am ashamed to say that I have one password set on 90% of sites and comps xd
<Gordon_Freeman> I just use easily-connectable words.
<Light_Latias> and nao
<Light_Latias> nini
<Gordon_Freeman> For example, one password is related to the other by way of synonyms.
<Outline> Ditto. I only have one password, with variable numbers at the end :(
<Ossala> i usally write them down and hide them in a notebook, that REALLY keeps my memory of it, cause i can always look in the notebook, and i'll remember that i DID write it in the notebook X3
<SilverSonic> ;o nini
<Outline> Thank god I vary usernames.

<UxieLover> 11Remember the second film? Tron drowned in that film.
<UxieLover> 11He fell into an ocean folowing a Kamikaze. He's not seen afterwoods, so it appears he died in that film. I'm very sad
<UxieLover> 11I've not decided whether to continue on or retire
<DSD> 4retire as in go to sleep?
<DSD> 4Or leave the wiki
<UxieLover> 11I meant on whether to continue or stop on the game (but I refuse to give up, but I'm just too sad)

<Light_Latias> 12:3
<xDaFreakshowx> Heavy Weapons Guy would be...............Derpy?
<Ivan2294> Medic is sadistic though.
<Lurkingear> will u marry me Fluttershy?

<Huge> Magic.
<prince-dari> It helps when I'm trying to find things that people have said before.
<SilverSonic> but how do i get them out of the grave?
<AppleDashWINS> RD would be a good Scout, but apparently, CancerousChimera thinks she's a better soldier
<Light_Latias> 12you pull the grave back?
<Light_Latias> 12and he's dead o.o
<AppleDashWINS> is there a meet the medic yet?
<Hipster_Brony> 8so... you have a text file with over a million lines so you can look up things people have said in the past?

<TurniBrony> 25MBs of it all is turbochat from The Room.
<AppleDashWINS> oh, well, what's his accent?
<Snowball> German
<Light_Latias> 12OH
<Snowball> Like me
<Light_Latias> 12I also made progress in the 2nd dungeon as well
<prince-dari> It auto-splits the file when it gets to a certain size, so it's more like 30 files.
<AppleDashWINS> what's hwg then?
<prince-dari> When it was all 1 file it took about 10 minutes to open. XD
<Light_Latias> 12so thats 2, 3, and 5 before 1 X3
<Snowball> Russian
*Light_Latias 12hides
<Ivan2294> Scout is self-centered so RD for him

<Snowball> WTF eating crutches? sorry watching i don't even know
<prince-dari> [20:32] <drfsupercenter> as this is kinda annoying me | Is there anything that doesn't annoy you?

*Angel_Espeon runs
<Light_Latias> 12:O
<CogWeaver> no, dont do it in their dimension either
<drfsupercenter> 03is when I have entire screens of chat logs full of one subject
<Barry> Now it's an ad that only applies to single people over 40
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's just like "Zelda is fun" and then the subject changes
<drfsupercenter> 03that's fine XD
<twentypercentcooler> ...
<Ivan2294> We have to meet in a neutral dimension
<xDaFreakshowx> umm
<Ivan2294> Like mario or Minecraft
<Barry> or something
<Light_Latias> 12Ew Family Guy <see Danny?
*Light_Latias 12isn't the only one
<CogWeaver> humans...get pretty creepy in MLP:FIM style...
<Ivan2294> Or the internet...
<xDaFreakshowx> We would look like retarded cartoon versions of ourselfs
<Revolver> If the Mane Cast showed up i our dimension, I would show RD and PP Cupcakes for the lols.
<Light_Latias> 12so :P
<xDaFreakshowx> selves*
<Ivan2294> they can't read english
<Ivan2294> Oh wait
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm also not the only one who doesn't like 5th generation Pokémon
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just the only one not afraid to say anything
<Gravekeeper> So many bronies
<Revolver> Translated or something.
<Ivan2294> Well, some of their books are in some random symbol language thingy
<Light_Latias> 12...random?

<Hipster_Brony> 8got another IMVU ad
<Snowball> Pinkie_Pie: I wouldn't do that.......yet
<Revolver> And sneak in a pic of RD while she's not looking to put on ED.
<Ivan2294> But the sign "Princess Celest" amongst other things...
<drfsupercenter> 03and see, this is a much better discussion as I can actually take part :D
*drfsupercenter hides
<Light_Latias> 12...
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats the one i get all the time
<drfsupercenter> 03let me rephrase
<Light_Latias> 12yes
<Light_Latias> 12an arguement
<drfsupercenter> 03it's; not so much the Zelda stuff that annoys me
<Light_Latias> 12how fitting
<drfsupercenter> 03it's when I can't say anything
<Nick> Family guy yeah...
<drfsupercenter> 03because it's nothing I know
<Ivan2294> PONIES ARE BILINGUAL BY NATURE
<Nick> used to be great
<drfsupercenter> 03then I'm sitting there watching entire lines of scrollback
<drfsupercenter> 03going someone change the subject
<Light_Latias> 12then
<Revolver> brb
<Light_Latias> 12play it
<Ivan2294> AND THEY SPEAK ENGLISH.
<drfsupercenter> 03how about no
<Light_Latias> 12and you'll know
<Ivan2294> Also, they somehow no what the F*CK french means....
<drfsupercenter> 03because you';re clearly too busy helping everyone ELSE with the game
<drfsupercenter> 03to help me
<drfsupercenter> 03if I need it
<drfsupercenter> 03more like
<drfsupercenter> 03when I need it
<drfsupercenter> 03sop
<drfsupercenter> 03-p
<drfsupercenter> 03some other time
<Light_Latias> 12not really
<prince-dari> I don't play any of these Zelda games that were being talked about.
<Ivan2294> Hence, they know about france...
<prince-dari> Did you see me whining? No.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I just don't say anything about any subject until I've tried it myself
<xDaFreakshowx> Hence...Equestria exists
<Angel_Espeon> 13THEN I say my opinion
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<SilverSonic> im only asking for help cause im new with teh game ;p
<xDaFreakshowx> o3o
<drfsupercenter> 03I wasn't whining
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<drfsupercenter> 03I just said "someone tell me when this discussion is over"
<xDaFreakshowx> Ponylogic
<Light_Latias> 12ANYONE who needs help in OoT
<Revolver> kback
<xDaFreakshowx> can't deny it
<Light_Latias> 12I answer to
<Gravekeeper> Flawless logic
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Light_Latias> 12even Kipi when he was here >.>
<drfsupercenter> 03so THAT'S how to get your attention
*drfsupercenter hides
<Light_Latias> 12well
<Ivan2294> ...I'm starting to suspect....
<Ivan2294> that ponies.....
<Light_Latias> 12that was Majora's Mask
<Light_Latias> 12but w/e
<Ivan2294> ....will take over the world after we all die....
<drfsupercenter> 03oh god
<RainBroDash> Hipster, just got the email update and shtuffs. So if I have you understood you want someone to be able to stream the new episodes when they air, straight from the hub onto our interwebs?
<Revolver> I wish.
<Aurora> 6Majora's Mask is so stressful lol
<Ivan2294> Why
<Revolver> That would be awesome.
<Angel_Espeon> 13But either way, I just simply idle and do other stuff and not pay any attention to a conversation I can't relate to
*drfsupercenter prepares to use gline
<Gravekeeper> Will they destroy the Statue of Liberty?
<xDaFreakshowx> Wait...you wish we were dead?
<Ivan2294> We would all be dead though
<Angel_Espeon> 13the topic will always change eventually
<Angel_Espeon> 13:B
<SomeFrenchBrony> So I heard you're talking about france ?
<xDaFreakshowx> How is that a good thing!?
<Aurora> 6...>.>
<drfsupercenter> 03what
<Revolver> That's okay with me.
<Ivan2294> Yes they probably would Gravekeeper
<Quanyails> 7Ah, meep, AE.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes
<drfsupercenter> 03I think pretty much everyone here is pissed at disney
<Revolver> We're due anyways, right?
<xDaFreakshowx> Must research magic on how to make myself immortal...
<drfsupercenter> 03and I mean the user, not the company a:P
<drfsupercenter> 03-a
<Quanyails> 7Similar when the talk ends up about computer tech. o.O
<Gravekeeper> Those darn, dirty equines!
<Aurora> 6and you're horrible
<Light_Latias> 12way to be nasty about it
<Revolver> And a legacy would be all the more awesome.
<drfsupercenter> 03for banning someone that's breaking rules?
<Light_Latias> 12right when they join
<Hipster_Brony> 8we have a few people lined up, but we still want more alternates in case anything goes wrong
<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah, OK, that's totally not doing my job
<Ivan2294> So they should know what humans are by examining fossils and ruins...
<drfsupercenter> 03I know
<RainBroDash> ah sounds genius. Means I won't have to wait for the youtube uploads to see the episodes as they first air
<Aurora> 6also, second to what quan said
<drfsupercenter> 03I was going to gline them yesterday
<Ivan2294> Hence they know what france is
<drfsupercenter> 03but they left
<drfsupercenter> 03so I was like
<drfsupercenter> 03whatever
<Ivan2294> And why they have such a sporadic era of technology
<Aurora> 6ok granted, I wasn't here
<SilverSonic> drf, lighten up
<Libri> Planet of the Apes. Except with ponies.
<RainBroDash> I'm assuming MLP won't air in the UK at the same time, or even nearly so
<Revolver> That'd be pretty cool, gotta say.
<drfsupercenter> 03SilverSonic
<drfsupercenter> 03we have a rule
<drfsupercenter> 03you have to be 13
*^Angel kicks you all.
<Aurora> 6bt i never can tell with you, you're not exactly the kindest person to people lol
<drfsupercenter> 03she's like 11 or something
<drfsupercenter> 03so
<Aurora> 6oh
<Aurora> 6well
<RainBroDash> depends how much of a UK fanbase it gets over the summer I presume
<Aurora> 6then go ahead lol
<Ivan2294> Ranging from DJ Turntables, to quils as pens.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah that's already #1 broken
<Revolver> Aww.
<Light_Latias> 12ok
<drfsupercenter> 03#2 is she refuses to use proper English
<Snowball> Yeah when Fluttershy was telling Rarity in Dress for Sucess
<drfsupercenter> 03when we tell her to every time
<Light_Latias> 12that I'll accept
<HyperMetalLugia> Improper english too :<
<drfsupercenter> 03she says antyhing
<drfsupercenter> 03*anything
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Revolver> French Haute Coutre sucks, though.
<Ivan2294> And that would also explain why 90% of their stuff is made for humans
<drfsupercenter> 03and people just call me mean without even knowing the whole story
<HyperMetalLugia> *reads the buffer*
<Light_Latias> 12well Danny
<Ivan2294> They replicated our technology
<drfsupercenter> 03Arti told me she was already going to ban
<Light_Latias> 12you're saying things
<drfsupercenter> 03but that Nick said not to
<drfsupercenter> 03unlike her, I don't answer to him
<Light_Latias> 12and not everyone was here
<Revolver> I wonder how ponies were made sentiant AFTER we die, then?
<Light_Latias> 12that looked like open hostility
<xDaFreakshowx> hmmm
<Light_Latias> 12to me
<Quanyails> 7Aggressive versus passive expression?
<Ivan2294> But then what about the whole sun and the moon being raised buy Alicorns thing?
<xDaFreakshowx> Escaped Genetics experiments.
<xDaFreakshowx> Magic.
<disney> haha everyooe:D
<Gravekeeper> It's magic
<Gravekeeper> Ain't gotta explain...
<xDaFreakshowx> Nuff said.
<Ivan2294> Okay
<Revolver> *caugh*jealousofmagicnow*cough*
<Aurora> 6well in my opinion, if the age rule is broken, there's no way around it lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8if its at the same time, it'll be at what, 1:30 here?
<Aurora> 6just use the ban and done
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Ivan2294> So it's official, the human race is going to be dominated by ponies
<Aurora> 6dunno why arti said not to
<Ivan2294> Or will have died out when they become sentient
<Hipster_Brony> 8which i think would put it around 6:30 GMT
<Snowball> It has been offical
<Ivan2294> Or we live on, but are on another planet.
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean, if someone's younger and actually acts mature, then I probably won't notice and won't care
<Ivan2294> SPACE WARS W/PONIES
<drfsupercenter> 03but in this case it's blatantly obvious
<Revolver> And Ponies, given time, SHOULD be able to create time machines, working off our technology, right>
<Revolver> ?
<Ivan2294> Yes.
<Ivan2294> THIS EXPLAINS SO MUCH
<Revolver> PONIES FROM THE FUTURE.
<SilverSonic> :/
*HyperMetalLugia slow claps
<Snowball> Pinkie Gigas?
<Revolver> They made themselves sentient.
<SilverSonic> well, That was just low drf
<Snowball> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2GThfvYp7U&feature=related
<drfsupercenter> 03SilverSonic
<drfsupercenter> 03how is banning someone for breaking the rules low
<Aurora> 6that wasn't really low
<SilverSonic> w/e
<drfsupercenter> 03I seriously do not see why you keep sticking up for rule breakers
<Quanyails> 7This would be an inappropriate time to add a reference.
<Light_Latias> 12Danny was in the right, SS
<drfsupercenter> 03this is like the third time now
<Aurora> 6it's one thing if it's just how a person acts, but age rule is strict
<RainBroDash> pretty sure I'll be at uni around that time
<Ivan2294> More like X-Com
<SilverSonic> ok ok ;P
<SilverSonic> w/e drf
<Aurora> 6it's actually illegal for people under 13 to be on forums and stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03and if they act annoying AND are too young, it's a double whammy :P
<Barry> Currently they have MLP: FiM running three times a day Tuesday-Friday
<Aurora> 6or whatever that was
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Sparky> ...
<Aurora> 6whoever said that
<Sparky> hahahaha
<Ivan2294> But with ponies
<HyperMetalLugia> Illegal O.o
<SilverSonic> :P
<drfsupercenter> 03they're supposed to get their parent's permission
<drfsupercenter> 03but does that ever happen?
<SilverSonic> MOVING ON
<Light_Latias> 12ohai Sparky
<Skylands> 10Most sites expect you to be at least 13 years old @ SS
<Barry> twice a day Saturday-Monday
<RainBroDash> *pray that I can convert my Uni flatmates to convert, so we can all enjoy ponies togethaarr*
<Ivan2294> And we will probably lose because the bronies will defect
<SilverSonic> I know that :P
<Revolver> Ponies made themselves sentient by time portaling back to our time and working with top scientists.
<Gravekeeper> It's happening at an alarming pace already
<drfsupercenter> 03that was one reason I found #SW annoying for a while, since we had all these young people
<Ivan2294> I feel as if I'm the only brony loyal to humans.
<Barry> Twice a day Saturday and Monday*
<drfsupercenter> 03but thankfully we don't have to worry about that anymore LOL
<Revolver> You are.
<Snowball> watch that and tell me a name that involves Pinkie and Gygas
<RainBroDash> but yeah, even at Uni I'll still be around (providing the community stays as active as it is now), just a different location innit
<Barry> not sure about Sunday

<Revolver> Ohlol.

<Fassad_McDuck> you are
<SilverSonic> like OoT
*SilverSonic flees
<drfsupercenter> 03OoT is not important
<RainBroDash> that's interesting Barry. I wonder if they'll keep the same 'multi-showing' or just air each episode one by one for first showing
<SilverSonic> it is to me
<Aurora> 6to get a referral from a doctor for a doctor because the old referral doesn't work for a certain doctor so now i need a new one X.x
<Light_Latias> 12and a literal minute left
<SilverSonic> :p
<Revolver> I was referancing Castlevania, though.
<Revolver> D:
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<Fassad_McDuck> you said it not me
<Light_Latias> 12I got the eyedrops to Biggoron
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what do you need a referral from a doctor for?
<xDaFreakshowx> What is this place?
<Snowball> Stereotypes who hate ponies
<RainBroDash> I mean seeing how damn popular a kids show has become, it might tear up the rulebook a bit :P
<Revolver> CASTLEVANIA.
<Ivan2294> I wanna play the new Castlevania games
*Skylands goes back to listening to Puella Magi OST
<xDaFreakshowx> I believe it's called "Foods Libraries"...
<Ivan2294> Terraria and metroid are awesome
<Aurora> 6to go to a speech therapist for a throat study
<Light_Latias> 12prolly for imunization recordds
<Fassad_McDuck> yes
<Light_Latias> 12-d
<Aurora> 6also +1 for skylands
<Barry> Tuesday-Friday, they show an episode at 8:30 AM, an encore of that episode at 1:30 PM, and a different episode at 6:30 PM
<xDaFreakshowx> Foods...libraries
<Ivan2294> So by logic so should Castlevania

<SomeFrenchBrony> but sometime i want to smell like a different smelling men
*Sparky goes back to watching PMMM, then
<Skylands> 10This, I think Aurora: [15:43] <SilverSonic> Can we please move on to something more important

<Ivan2294> So, what is the best way to kill a pony.
<CogWeaver> sup Mongoose
<Aurora> 6I've watched the series 4 times by now

<Ivan2294> Sup Goosemon
<Skylands> 10Dunno
<xDaFreakshowx> Gooseman.
<SomeFrenchBrony> best way to kill a pony ?
<Snowball> Imagine us now on ponies conqouring the non-bronies
<Fassad_McDuck> to animals, man is...
<Aurora> 6well, some people consider it Kyoko's I guess, since that was the big fight
<Ivan2294> Goosemon the best type of digimon there is.
<Revolver> But whai?
<SomeFrenchBrony> tell him that some humans are cloping to them
<Revolver> D:
<Aurora> 6but it's technically octavia's
<Revolver> Why would you do that?
<Skylands> 10Then YT must not have hers
<MoronSonOfBoron> My god, The Dark Crystal is a terrible movie
<Fooby> I have a 30-second lag connection to the chat.
<Fooby> This is not good.
<Skylands> 10Oh well, still good
<xDaFreakshowx> hahaha
<Aurora> 6if she has a specific theme, it should be on the OST
<Ivan2294> No, I will side with the bronies in the Brony-Non-brony wars
<xDaFreakshowx> The dark crystal...
<Fassad_McDuck> worse than the devil if he was a pedophile, and have 2d personalities, large chins, and were written horribly.
<Skylands> 10medievalish
<Ivan2294> But not the pony-human wars
<Barry> Tomorrow's 8:30 AM episode will be Sonic Rainboom
<Revolver> Ponies are better than mankind.
*Light_Latias 12reminded of a final boss theme
<Revolver> True fax.
<Fassad_McDuck> the ponies would take you prisoner because you are a human
<Aurora> 6mami's theme still is awesome
<Ivan2294> I don't care, I like being human
<Light_Latias> 12sounds as epic
<Skylands> 10Yep
<MoronSonOfBoron> Ponies were conceived by human minds.
<Revolver> Okay.
<Revolver> Good.
<Revolver> Let them.
<Aurora> 6I have the nico cover version as my alarm on my phone

<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Aurora> 6whatever
<Rafasde> So mea n.
<Ivan2294> I'm one of few, if any, bronies that woud fight for the humans if a pony-human war happened.

<Rafasde> THAT was the only good thing that the humans did.
<Ivan2294> wtf man
<Ivan2294> Why
<Ivan2294> I prefer to LIVE
<Rafasde> LIVE
<Ivan2294> So I can like ponies
<Revolver> I'd offer to become a spy first, though.
<Rafasde> Ivan is totally right

<Snowball> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZJ2gOouklk&feature=grec_index
<Snowball> nah
<Light_Latias> 12that
<CogWeaver> also, there is no way to have humans in the same style of MLP:FIM without them being COMPLETELY, OUTRAGEOUSLY creepy...
<Rafasde> And watch ponies.
<Ivan2294> and talk about ponies
<Revolver> How could I fight?
<Light_Latias> 12is making me think of another song
<Fassad_McDuck> hitler is more awesome than you, because he has a moustache, no one would want to be executed by him... or anything to do with him... except for that moustache...
<Aurora> 6that's like one of my favorite songs ever
<Revolver> Not fun fighting something THAT amazing.
<Aurora> 6that and MAGIA, the anime's ending
<Revolver> Fassad, being excecuted by Hitler himself would be weird.
<Rafasde> ...Hitler is one of the meanest humans of all human history. Mean.
<Skylands> 10Ending > opening
<Tenaris> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGvlSj_apw4&feature=feedlik
<Fassad_McDuck> he is mean
<Ivan2294> I'm pretty sure people wouldn't mind being executed by Hitler's moustache
<Aurora> 6^
<Snowball> So is Stalin
<Revolver> Being excecuted by Hitler MOUSTACHE, however, would be cool.
<Aurora> 6I've grown to like the OP, but yeah MAGIA is SOOOOO much better
<Ivan2294> Exactly
<Ivan2294> But I still like to live
<Light_Latias> 12http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_5nFS5xxJU the previous song reminds me of this o.o

<Ivan2294> So yeah, GO HUMANS
<Ivan2294> WE HAVE THUMBS
<Revolver> THUMBS?
<Ivan2294> THUMBS
<Revolver> THUMBS ARE TRIVIAL.
<Fassad_McDuck> at least allow me to grow a moustache and then shave it into a square because it's an awesom moustache.
<Ivan2294> BUT AWSEOME

<Mongoose> I hate thumbs

<Ivan2294> THUMBS ARE SO AWESOME
<Ivan2294> okay
<Sparky> SAYAKAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Revolver> When you are a pony, REALITY BENDS TO YOUR WILL.
<Revolver> SO YOU DON'T NEED THUMBS.
<Ivan2294> That only applies to pinkie
<Ivan2294> You will be, but a lowly earth pony
<Lunies> Of course Magia is better

<Aurora> 6granted, I love all the characters ina way

<Ivan2294> Celestia would never give us humans powers.

<Aurora> 6I just can't believe how long it took me to track down the 1st episode version
<Ivan2294> Because she is afraid to Queen it up
<Revolver> No human is best human, because America doesn't want it to.
<Retsamoreh> King Arthur?
<Spectrum> or maybe the Queen is a nice Queen who was locked in a dungeon by her tyranical daughter, the princess?
<Rafasde> Revo is trying to troll?
<Ivan2294> We should ask Lauren Faust

<Light_Latias> 12blah
<Light_Latias> 12no
<Rafasde> Laures IS the best human.
<Revolver> The world is going to end.
<Spectrum> I've always liked the theory that Celestia threw her parents in a dungeon and ruled Equestria with an iron hoof

<MoronSonOfBoron> Does that make Luna the Devil?

<Light_Latias> 12there's a slight difference in the N64 game's Forest Temple theme and the soundtrack
<Revolver> :l
<Light_Latias> 12's
<Rafasde> Lucifer was an angel.
<MoronSonOfBoron> A third of the pony host banished to the moon
<CogWeaver> Nightmare Moon would be more like that

<Sparky> okay
<Light_Latias> 12I showed you the difference, correct?
<Sparky> one more time and then I move on
<CogWeaver> Nightmare moon is to Luna as Satan is to Lucifer?
<CogWeaver> I guess?
<CogWeaver> idk

<Ivan2294> Not really
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Aurora> 6....how ever i should type that
<Rafasde> I think so.
<Aurora> 6yeh
<Ivan2294> If Twilight turned evil, that would fit Lucifer better
<Light_Latias> 12they used the soundtrack's one >_>;
<Light_Latias> 12and it sounds horrid
<Fireant> Lucifer wasn't evil.
<Revolver> :o
<Ivan2294> Although yeah, Nightmare moon would fit
<Angel_Espeon> 13I always find it hilarious when people try to hum parts of a tune in the form of text LOL
<Fireant> Well, at his genesis so to speak.
<Ivan2294> Although she is a little too powerful for that.
<Rafasde> Because Lucifer was an angel like Luna, an then became evil.(Nighmare Moon)
<SilverSonic> XD
<Fireant> Not true too.
<SilverSonic> Same AE
<Revolver> I can't argue religion with you guise.
<Light_Latias> 12it should be a slower doo doo doo doo doo
<Light_Latias> 12but nooooooo they used the fast 2-doo
<Retsamoreh> Why are we arguing about religion?
<Ivan2294> Lucifer isn't the leader of hell or anything though.
*Light_Latias 12-.-
<MoronSonOfBoron> Lucifer's plan was to force ponies—er, people to love God by force, if I recall correctly
<Fireant> Lucifer - a name for Jesus, really. The one who bring light.
<MoronSonOfBoron> Nightmare Moon was the same

<Ivan2294> RELIGOUS PONIES
<Aurora> 6same
<Light_Latias> 12since the blocks
<Fassad_McDuck> why are you guys arguing about the most cliche'd, most stereotypical and most futile argument in a show about animals as the main characters?
<Rafasde> DAMN LAG.
<SilverSonic> LOL im live on livestream, the uncensored version of Firetemple is after hte next song XD
<Light_Latias> 12lack the crescent moon and star
<Retsamoreh> MONK PONIES!
<Fireant> It was later reshaped to fit the role of fallen angel because Roman Church was in a fight with Alexandrian Bishops and their own christian sect.
<Ivan2294> CATHOLIC PONIES
<Rafasde> Hey, Fassad is a McDuck?
<Fassad_McDuck> and now we're talking about religion?
<Aurora> 6LL, do you know if someone has a clip of the original Forest Temple song on YT?
<CogWeaver> so...do ponies "worship" Celestia? she does kinda fit the bill of being a God to them...
<Aurora> 6I haven't heard it in forever
<Ivan2294> How the F*CK DID THIS HAPPEN.
<Light_Latias> 12no idea
<Revolver> Interesting.
<Light_Latias> 12if I knew how
<CogWeaver> I DON'T KNOW
<Ali1017> Topic Change GO
<Fassad_McDuck> revo is being a stereotypical human hater and troll
<ST_Falcon> Judging by her behavior, she'd really prefer they didn't.
<CogWeaver> BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE NOT FLAMING EACH OTHER'S RELIGIONS, I SAY IT'S FINE
<Light_Latias> 12I would take both of them from the N64 copy
<Fassad_McDuck> and
<Ivan2294> GHOST RECON PONIES, DISCUSS
<Rafasde> Cog, I think that she's the Princess and they respect her.

<SilverSonic> http://www.livestream.com/silversonicsmusichour Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiink~
<Light_Latias> 12the Spirit Temple's theme is good
<CogWeaver> I DUN WANNA!
<Revolver> STARCRAFT WAS A TERRIBLE RIPOFF.
<Ivan2294> RTS GAMES SUCK
<Rafasde> LET'S DISCUSS WHY CAPS AND BOLD ISN'T COOL.
<Aurora> 6I love the spirit temple
<Ivan2294> BUT CAPS AND BOLD ARE COOL
<Revolver> YOU SUCK, IVAN.
<Ivan2294> YOU SUCK REVOLVER
<SomeFrenchBrony> BECAUSE IT MAKE EYES BLEEDING
<SomeFrenchBrony> SO TOP
<Revolver> I SENSE A BAN COMING ON.
<Ivan2294> Okay
<Ivan2294> lol
<CogWeaver> stop, everypony
<CogWeaver> stop
<Ivan2294> We changed the topic didn't we?
<Aurora> 6Kotake and Koume's theme <3
<Ivan2294> ^_^
<Silver_Heart> http://lo-ping.org/2011/06/20/my-little-pony-fighting-game-my-little-pony-fighting-game/
<drfsupercenter> 03bbl
<Isukra> 12it's a trap
<Revolver> I feel a kick coming on.
<Light_Latias> 12yush :O
<Light_Latias> 12when they're evil witches :P
<Revolver> Also, RTS games do not suck, Ivan.
<Light_Latias> 12as opposed to innocent potion makers
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Ivan2294> But I don't like Fighting games...
<Revolver> How do they suck?
<Light_Latias> 12with the same dark theme
<Aurora> 6Majora's mask was so trippy
<Ivan2294> Also, I know that Revolver
<Rafasde> CAPS AND BOLD ARE NOT COOL, YA KNOW. DISCUSS IT.
<Rafasde> ...
<Rafasde> Great. Silence.
<Rafasde> Better than religion.
<Ivan2294> I was trolling
*Light_Latias 12nods
<MoronSonOfBoron> Pony RTS, what would it look like
<Aurora> 6I was dissappointed with the music
<Revolver> You suck at trolling.
<Light_Latias> 12I showed a friend the beginning interactions with the Happy Mask salesman
<Ivan2294> Well, you reacted
<Light_Latias> 12and he was like WTF
<Isukra> 12i beat Majora's Mask in 3 days
<Light_Latias> 12LOL
<Aurora> 6the ONLY good songs that came out of it were Clock Town, Clock Town's Final Hours, Stone Temple, and Song of Healing
<Light_Latias> 12good one XD
<Ivan2294> Anyways, I like RTS games
<Revolver> It would have something to do with the freindship flowing.
<CogWeaver> aaaaaaaaaanyways
<Ivan2294> They're just all the same.
<Aurora> 6lol @that
<Rafasde> Revo sucks at telling people that they suck at trolling.
<Light_Latias> 12Stone Temple <3
<Light_Latias> 12err
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6tower
<Light_Latias> 12*Stone Tower Temple <3
<Aurora> 6wtf lol
<Revolver> I can accept this.
<CogWeaver> you suck at saying the Rev sucks at telling people that they suck at trolling
<prince-dari> So my sister tells me Rebecca Black is in the music video for a Katy Perry song (eugh).
<Revolver> THE FRIENDSHIP MUST FLOW.
<Ivan2294> Starcraft, Command and Conquer, Red Alert, and most RTS games are too similar
<Revolver> Dune 2000 was cool.
<Ivan2294> One is just more balanced than the other.
<Aurora> 6that sounded like a "so a guy walks into a bar" joke
<Aurora> 6I was waiting for a punch line
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<Revolver> And Ivan, those are the crappy ones.
<MoronSonOfBoron> Maybe a Pony RTS would be more like a giant football game
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Ivan2294> I like it when strategy games mix it up
<Revolver> Try Dawn of War.
<MoronSonOfBoron> Each player strives to gather the Elements of Harmony
<Light_Latias> 12and Roara
<Rafasde> Cog sucks at remining me that I suck when saying that people suck at saying that other people suck at trolling.
<Ivan2294> Or World in Conflict
<Light_Latias> 12I kinda like Termina's theme o.o
<CogWeaver> Applejack is the best pony, don't discuss
<Light_Latias> 12tho
<CogWeaver> Rafasde should not be telling a mod that they suck at anything...
<Rafasde> Applejack is the NICEST, not the best.
<Revolver> Applejack and Rainbow Dash are the best.
<Ivan2294> X-Com was really unique
<Light_Latias> 12I HATE how it starts off like Hyrule Field's
<Aurora> 6I'm REALLY unimpressed with the songs you have to learn in that game
<B-Man> Silly CogWeaver, that's not how you spell APPLEBLOOM
<Rafasde> Rainbow Dash, yes.
<Revolver> X-Com was AWESOME.
<CogWeaver> lol, B-Man
<Aurora> 6they're not nearly as interesting as OoT
<Rafasde> Apple Bloom?
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Ivan2294> B-Man you're getting the CMC names mixed up
<Rafasde> Really?
<Ivan2294> It's Scootaloo remember?
<Rafasde> My favorite CMC is Scootaloo.
<Aurora> 6oath to order is ok
<Ivan2294> ^
<Revolver> Apple Bloom here.
<Light_Latias> 12yah
<Rafasde> Favorite pony it's Rainbow Dash. PEGASI.
<Ivan2294> My Favorite CMC, and favorite pony is Scootaloo
<Rafasde> *is
<Light_Latias> 12but >_> Goron's Lullaby
<Aurora> 6song of healing goes without saying
<Aurora> 6...god lol
<CogWeaver> Applebloom is DEFINATELY the cutest pony...but not the best
<Ivan2294> But I think the best pony is Fluttershy
<Light_Latias> 12and that brat you learn it from
<CogWeaver> Applejack is the best pony
<Revolver> Although Scootaloo is really coming close.
<B-Man> Applebloom is teh awesome.
<Ivan2294> Either way all the coolest ponies Pegasi
<Ivan2294> We can agree to taht right?
<Light_Latias> 12so boring it put him to sleep just singing it
<Aurora> 6STFU
<Aurora> 6seriously
<Revolver> Apple Bloom is fun to draw when you add Grimdark.
*Light_Latias 12hides
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Rafasde> I like Scoot's and Dash's awsome pegasi stuff.
<CogWeaver> Ivan: nope.avi
<Aurora> 6he doesn't STOP
<Revolver> http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Pony17001.jpg
<Light_Latias> 12and when you win/lose the Goron Races(which I admit is fun)
<Ivan2294> ಠ_ಠ
<Rafasde> Cog: srsly?.avi
<Revolver> Apple Bloom is most definately cutest.
<Light_Latias> 12HE gives the speeches
<Ivan2294> Pegasi = coolest
<Rafasde> Apple Bloom is the cutest. Agreed.
<Ivan2294> Scootaloo is best CMC
<AppleDashWINS> ^
<Ivan2294> Fluttershy is the best pony
*Light_Latias 12takes the Gold Dust Bottle and shoves it over his head
<AppleDashWINS> AB is still cute tho
<Ivan2294> And RD is the awesomest Character
<AppleDashWINS> and no one remembers Sweetie Belle :(
<Ivan2294> yep
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Who?
<Rafasde> So... Sweetie Belle is the worst CMC. Agree?
<Ivan2294> no one remembers....whats her name again?
<CogWeaver> no
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
<AppleDashWINS> not the worst, but most neglected
<Revolver> Sweetie Belle is annoying in Desktop Ponies.
<Rafasde> "No"?
<Ivan2294> I think she's the sister of that one pony no one likes
<Lightning_Quickhoof> Who is, AppleDash?
<CogWeaver> Applebloom > Sweetie Belle > Scootaloo
<Revolver> But I still have her on there....
<Ivan2294> COG YOU ARE GOING TO DIE
<Rafasde> Damn, Ivan stop rading my mind man.
<Aurora> 6the song of time reversion and compression
<Ivan2294> I LOVE DESKTOP PONIES
<Light_Latias> 12the New Wave Bossa Nova was pointless
<AppleDashWINS> Sweetie doesn't have as much as Scoots and Apple Bloom, so that may be why
<Revolver> I have Twilight, RD, AJ, and the CMC on my desktop.
*Skylands pokes Angel_Espeon
<Aurora> 6whaaaaat >.>
<Rafasde> COG YOU ARE GOING TO... wait, Ivan said this already.
<Ivan2294> Although the new sounds are annoying.
<Aurora> 6and yeh, that one was horrible
<Revolver> The CMC are worthy.
<Aurora> 6I seriously hated NWBN
<Revolver> Fluttershy is not, apparently.
<Light_Latias> 12woot, I summoned a TURTLE :D
<Revolver> Or Pinkie.
<Ivan2294> I have EVERYONE on my desktop, minus duplicates
<Revolver> Or Rarity.
<Light_Latias> 12...now what?
<CogWeaver> Silly chatters, you can't kill a mod!
<Aurora> 6sonata of awakening is...meh, not horrible though
<Ivan2294> Like Filly celestia or 80s cheerilee
<Light_Latias> 12after that, the song has NO POINT
<Light_Latias> 12lolz
<Aurora> 6song of soaring is a horrible rip off of song of storms
<Rafasde> You'll see Cog!
<Light_Latias> 12I like how you learned it from the monky
<Rafasde> I'll just check my friggin' command list and you'll see!
<Revolver> I prefer 80's Cherilee over Cheerilee.
<Light_Latias> 12*monkey
<Ivan2294> Me too
<Aurora> 6lol
<Light_Latias> 12@Sonata
<Light_Latias> 12and yah
<Light_Latias> 12@Song of Soaring
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> You cant kill ME!!!
<Rafasde> Let's see... "High Kick"...
<AppleDashWINS> love both cheerilees
<Rafasde> OH NO IT'S DERPY.
<Ivan2294> http://bronibooru.mlponies.com/data/sample/8150a7d00cdf97c47ef3af7a8274fbae.jpg
<Revolver> !muffins
<Light_Latias> 12they apparently NEEDEDX Kaepora Gaebora in that game
<Light_Latias> 12-x
<CogWeaver> Derpy: KILL
<Revolver> Aww.
<Rafasde> KILL IT. NOW.
<Light_Latias> 12so they shoved him in as a side note
<Light_Latias> 12just for that song
<Ivan2294> kill what?
<Aurora> 6NWBN still makes my ears bleed
<Light_Latias> 12XD
*Rafasde fires a Hadouken at Derpy*
*Light_Latias 12doesn't mind the Elegy of Emptiness tho
*Ivan2294 uses AMERICA to win everything
<Aurora> 6elegy-
<Aurora> 6yeh
<Aurora> 6I was about to say that xD
<Light_Latias> 12wheeeee
*CogWeaver uses Equestira to beat AMERICA*
<Aurora> 6BEN
<Aurora> 6IT'S BEN
<Light_Latias> 12 4 statues :D
<Revolver> *slaps Ivan*
<CogWeaver> :P
<Revolver> NO
*Rafasde thinks that America (USA) is fat.*
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> KILLAMANGARO!
<Ivan2294> lol
<Light_Latias> 12my army~
<Revolver> Cogweaver WINS.
<CogWeaver> eeeyup
<Light_Latias> 12 1 statue being completely useless
<CogWeaver> :D
<Ivan2294> I like how we're all fat, yet for some reason everyone in our country hates fat people...
<Aurora> 6xD
<Ivan2294> Well, not hate
<Revolver> *salutes* Commander CogWeaver, SIR!
<Ivan2294> But apparently it isn't normal
<Rafasde> You guys hate yourselves?
*Lightning_Quickhoof is listening/watching the Demoman Ooga Boogas thing
<CogWeaver> At ease, soldier
<Ivan2294> Pretty much Rafasde
<Revolver> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QddbSEv41bE&feature=related
<Revolver> Is listening to this
<Revolver> .
<Light_Latias> 12tho the best part
*Muffin_Overlord_Derpy Gets out AK-47* HEY AM I TOO LATE....
*Revolver is listening to Gobi's Valley theme.
<Light_Latias> 12was making the Song of Time the most important
<Ivan2294> We make fun of ourselves so much, and then we point out everything wrong with our country and don't do a damn thing about it
<Rafasde> But you guys are the richest country on thw world. Cheer up.
<Light_Latias> 12tho it's children were meh
<Micro_Nick> random question, favourite retro video game? (has to be pre-ps2/GC/Xbox):
<Revolver> Kalashinovs away, FOR NOW....
<Light_Latias> 12the Inverted Song and the Song of Double Time
<Light_Latias> 12Kirby 64
<Light_Latias> 12@Nick
<Ivan2294> >implying Ak-47 has yet to be upgraded
<Rafasde> Not the best, but the richest.
<CogWeaver> yes, Derpy, you're VERY late
<Micro_Nick> N64 <3
<Ivan2294> AK-101, AK-103, Ak-107, Ak-74
<Light_Latias> 12OoT a tie with it
<CogWeaver> let's try it again, okay?
<SilverSonic> SUPER MARIO 64! <333333333333333
<Ivan2294> Why do people only like Ak-47 again?
<Revolver> *puts Kalashinov in pack*
<CogWeaver> Derpy: KILL NON-MODERATORS
<SilverSonic> and OoT of course~
<Micro_Nick> lol for a moment I thought you said Superman 64 SS xD
*Light_Latias 12lolz
<Revolver> Because it was mass produced the most.
<Micro_Nick> *shudders at Super Man 64
<Ivan2294> Yes
<Ivan2294> But I mean in videogames
<Aurora> 6OH MY GOD KIRBY 64
<Light_Latias> 12the poor Playstation 1 gets no love
<Aurora> 6THAT GAME WAS AWESOE
<Light_Latias> 12<3
<Aurora> 6+m
<Ivan2294> It's always Ak-47
<Revolver> Because it got the most famous.
<Light_Latias> 12it constantly battles with OoT
<xDaFreakshowx> :P
<Ivan2294> But supposedly CoD is aiming for Modern Warfare
<Light_Latias> 12and it deserves a 3DS remake
<Micro_Nick> true lati, even though it sold better than the N64 and had its fair share of great games its never really mentioned much in retro gaming mags or videos
<Ivan2294> Yet Russia still uses the 47
<xDaFreakshowx> AK-74u
<Micro_Nick> the AVGN has only ever done one PS1 game
<Ivan2294> True
<SilverSonic> @Nick EW SUPERMAN64
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<SilverSonic> that game was god awful
<Micro_Nick> xD
<prince-dari> PS1 has Spyro 1 and 2.
<Ivan2294> But they already have even better than the 74
<Revolver> And you always get them instead of the upgraded versions because the upgraded ones are usually produced by MILITARIES.
*SilverSonic sadly owned it .-.
<Ivan2294> *newer not really better
<Micro_Nick> that game really is on par with ET atari
<Micro_Nick> o.o
<Aurora> 6ok
<Sparky> KYUBEI I LOVE YOU BUT I HATE YOU SO MUCH
<Micro_Nick> AAAH QUARANTINE THEM! *quarantines SS
<Sparky> :'D
<xDaFreakshowx> They should include the M8
<xDaFreakshowx> :I
<Aurora> 6time to go to the doctor's
<Aurora> 6bbl
<xDaFreakshowx> derp.
<Micro_Nick> but yeah Spyro 3 <3
<Revolver> Russia uses the AK-47u because they produced it, and it's still efficient.
<Isukra> 12Light_Latias needs her own game
<SilverSonic> NO Nick
<Light_Latias> 12kay Roara
<xDaFreakshowx> Even though i think it never made it past prototype stage
<Isukra> 12the adventures of Light_Latias
<Isukra> 12:D
<Ivan2294> *74u
<SilverSonic> I dont own it anymore
<Micro_Nick> I didn;t play the first 2 but played the 3rd in curiosity, it was a great descision
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Ivan2294> you mean the XM8 right?
<xDaFreakshowx> yeah
<Micro_Nick> also Metal Gear Solid, and the first 3 resi evils <3
*Isukra hides Micro_Nick in his feathers
<Revolver> More practical to produce than say, 101.
<xDaFreakshowx> Didnt know if it got mass produced or not
<prince-dari> Spyro 1 was pretty much my first ever game.
<Ivan2294> Yeah, that project was cancelled, but they made a LOT of prototypes.
<CogWeaver> why are we discussing guns, and what does this have to do with ponies?
<Revolver> It did.
<Micro_Nick> glumph o-o
<xDaFreakshowx> idk
<Light_Latias> 12A Link to the Past was mine oxo
<xDaFreakshowx> i came back and people were talkin bout guns so...
<Revolver> The Soviets made a helluva lot of them.
<Ivan2294> Ponies are related to everything
<Isukra> 12o-o
<SilverSonic> Super Mario 64 for meh
<SilverSonic> o3o
<Isukra> 12super mario kart
<Ivan2294> We are trying to take over the world
<capt_slowpoke> The XM8 is less of a gun and more of a fish crossed with a super soaker
<ZaLOLer> I just read Cupcakes.
<Micro_Nick> but since I got my NES (and soon to be Atari 2600) I have some new faves notably contra
<ZaLOLer> And I laughed.
<ZaLOLer> :3
<Revolver> ...
<Revolver> :o
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<CogWeaver> good for you, ZaLOLer
<Ivan2294> So we need to know our weapons when we declare war on major nuclear powers.
<Isukra> 12Okami 3D
<Isukra> 12would drive me nuts
<Micro_Nick> that game is just...EEEEH so simple yet just amazingly playable
<Light_Latias> 12I need a NES D:
<ZaLOLer> ...
<Light_Latias> 12tho
<xDaFreakshowx> The XM8 was supposedly the US's counter to the G36c.
*Micro_Nick waves his NES at Light Lati teasingly
<xDaFreakshowx> :P
<Light_Latias> 12I beat Zelda 1-2 and Mario 1-REAL 2
<Revolver> I say we use the Kalashinov.
<Micro_Nick> lol @ REAL2
<xDaFreakshowx> Nawbro...I'll use a FAMAs
<Light_Latias> 12that dream in Subcon doesn't deserve the 2 >_>
<xDaFreakshowx> FAMAS*
<Ivan2294> That way, we'll know how to use all the weapons after the Nuclear Apocalypse and can easily start a new nation
<Ivan2294> I prefer Scar-L
<Ivan2294> Or Scar-H
<Light_Latias> 12the real 2 never left Japan till...1994
<Revolver> It's fit for medium distances, and pretty inexpensive at that.
<Ivan2294> H is a higher caliber so probably that.
<Sparky> eh?
<ZaLOLer> You people are boring. Ima go fight some ninjas.
<capt_slowpoke> I use Kalashnikov in shotgun format
<Larscis> xDaFreakshowx: Yes, but its mostly-plastic construction made it...unpopular.
<Revolver> The Scar is annoying.
<Micro_Nick> I do have an atari plug and play game, missile comand is cool :D
<HyperMetalLugia> Spyro1 here too, along with Pokemon Yellow lol
<xDaFreakshowx> :p
<Sparky> oh
<Ivan2294> Which one is annoying?
<Revolver> Both,
<Light_Latias> 12ah yes
<Necromas> FlutterHUGE: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/9bbec3da7a8f7971b70977515db1575d/25677%20-%20absurd_res%20artist%3AAtomicGreymon%20fluttershy.png
<Ivan2294> Why?
<Micro_Nick> oh yes how could I forget the original Pokemon silver, the game that introduced me to the franchise
<Light_Latias> 12the rat's game
<xDaFreakshowx> :o
<Light_Latias> 12Yellow
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<HyperMetalLugia> hah
<Angel_Espeon> 13How can a pasty be "unsuitable for microwaving"?
<capt_slowpoke> I think quad rails are ugly no matter what they're on
<Ivan2294> SO CUTE
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Angel_Espeon> 13because that's what it said on the packet of the one I'm eating now
*Angel_Espeon was a rebel and microwaved it anyway
<Micro_Nick> and SS was even better <3
<Ivan2294> No one really cares about what your gun looks liek in combat....
<Revolver> The Scar... is wimpy to say the least.
<ST_Falcon> AA-12
<Larscis> Which is why that TAR-21 exists.
<Revolver> It even SOUNDS wimpy.
<ST_Falcon> also: behold cats http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/26288
<Ivan2294> How is it wimpy?
<Ivan2294> It seems pretty good to me.
<Ivan2294> L variant can use M16 ammo, and H variant is more powerful.
<Sparky> lol she gave her an umaibou :'D
<SilverSonic> lmao SS nickalerts me XD but i know your SS is Soul Silver
<SilverSonic> XD
<Light_Latias> 12SS
<Micro_Nick> I can't believe they took some things out of black n white that were in SS :\ (and lol SilverSonic!)
<Light_Latias> 12still playing OoT?
<Micro_Nick> such as walking with pokemon and the sports arena
<xDaFreakshowx> AA-12 is good for if you're in water or dirty enviroments.
<Ivan2294> Also, a major problem with the 47 is that it's recoil is really high
<Revolver> Still not very imposing when compared to other guns.
<capt_slowpoke> the cat thing is great
<Larscis> Ivan: Except it kept melting.
<xDaFreakshowx> also...low recoil
<Revolver> The RECOIL?
<Ivan2294> What kept melting Larscis?
<Larscis> The XM-8
<Revolver> Not a problem when you're a MAN and not a WIMP.
<capt_slowpoke> the AA=12 is also good if you want to shoot exploding bullets
<xDaFreakshowx> hehe
<SilverSonic> yes
<Ivan2294> Full auto recoil is bad man
<xDaFreakshowx> Dragon's Breath rounds anyone?
<ST_Falcon> For a fully automatic SHOTGUN?
<Ivan2294> But single shot isn't too bad
<xDaFreakshowx> Yeah...
<Ivan2294> We talkin bout 47
<xDaFreakshowx> Has spring countermeasures
<Revolver> Stop being a wimp and this is not bad.
<capt_slowpoke> I was referring to the frag-12 rounds designed for it
<xDaFreakshowx> check out FPSrussia's AA-12 vid
<ZekeS> lol
<xDaFreakshowx> he shoots it one handed.
<amaya> hello
<Larscis> Hey, the AA-12 is part of my standard loadout for visitng Pittsburgh. Even the TSA understands.
<Micro_Nick> shame the pokewalker couldn't have been kept too...I bet any money sometime in the future, HG & SS with the walker are gonna be collectors items
<ST_Falcon> The AA-12 is a monstrous weapon any way you slice it.
<Ivan2294> I prefer the 107, it's gas-powered I think and much lighter.
<capt_slowpoke> dragons breath rounds are't really good for anything buy looking cool and fouling your barrel really fast.
<xDaFreakshowx> hahah
<xDaFreakshowx> true...true
<Larscis> So..how long until Fireant designates this channel as a gun-free zone?
<capt_slowpoke> *but
<xDaFreakshowx> xD
<Revolver> Also, wood on a gun just looks so amazing.
<xDaFreakshowx> Until now...
<Revolver> No matter how impractical.
<Ivan2294> We aren't talking looks
<Ivan2294> We are talking performance
<Revolver> I know, but still.
<xDaFreakshowx> Only REAL gun I own is a wimpy Ruger .22
<xDaFreakshowx> but...at least it has a 60 round "Banana" clip
<xDaFreakshowx> :3
<Ivan2294> and I am in very dangerous territory right now, because I have never shot a gun...
*Revolver is too young to own a gun, sadly.
<DerpyBot> *derp*
<xDaFreakshowx> derp
<capt_slowpoke> I own lots
<xDaFreakshowx> !derp
<Ivan2294> Closest I've gotten is Arma 2.....

<CogWeaver> ...and stay away from the mean ol' man, ZekeS
<prince-dari> Orlynao?
<prince-dari> "Apparently Valve is suffering the same fate as Riot Games. Various employees are sporting pony avatars, and their Official Tech Support steam group has adopted a Gorden Freemane avatar. For every negative press release we get, two major entertainment hubs convert to ponydom. I love the internet.
<prince-dari> "
<CogWeaver> ...And Fireant
<capt_slowpoke> And this is why I ban chat bots in every channel I moderate.
<ZekeS> capt_slowpoke: meh
<ZekeS> chat bots are fine

<ZekeS> lol, true
<ZekeS> Chat bots are fun tho, like Luna over in brony or phrik on freenode.#archlinux

<Barry> lol
<Light_Latias> 12wbs Roara
<Barry> Dubstep: That reminded me of that Fairly Oddparents episode where the magic wish copier was jammed with real jam
<Kosoveon> hi aurora
<Aurora> hi
<Barry> I figure that's the joke
<Light_Latias> 12and now on to...
*Light_Latias 12teardrop
<Light_Latias> 12Volvagia
<Aurora> 6volvagia <3
<Light_Latias> 12the manga made its backstory so sad D:
<Light_Latias> 12and Link's battle with it even worse
<Light_Latias> 12;-;
<Aurora> 6yep
<NightSeas> 12Floofy
<NightSeas> 12Hi Aurora
<Light_Latias> 12OMGOMGOMGOMG
<Aurora> 6o.o
<Light_Latias> 12the 3D and increased visuals on Volvagia are AMAZING
<Light_Latias> 12O_O
<Aurora> 6lol I imagined they'd be pretty awesome
<Light_Latias> 12and dead
<Light_Latias> 12they were O_____________O
<Light_Latias> 12and yay the power of the Biggoron Sword, making short work of both Phantom Ganon and Volvagia
<Aurora> 6I wish I knew someone with 3DS
<Aurora> 6I want to see this in person
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Light_Latias> 12wait
<Angel_Espeon> 13Same Roara
<Helanga> 12i have a 3DS Aurora
*Light_Latias 12suddently wonders what Bongo Bongo looks like o3o
<NightSeas> 12I have a 3DS :3
<Helanga> 12what we don't count?
<Light_Latias> 12and Twinrova
<Aurora> 6*I wish I knew someone in person
<Angel_Espeon> 13well there was this one time the 3DS was on display in a game store recently
<Angel_Espeon> 13but
<Aurora> 6oh god bongo bongo
<Aurora> 6in 3D
<Angel_Espeon> 13too many people crowded around it for me to see ;w;
<Helanga> 12XD
<Aurora> 6I would be scarred for life
<Light_Latias> 12LOL
<Light_Latias> 12giant hands grabbing, poindong
<Light_Latias> 12*pounding
<Aurora> 6we have a 3DS at target
<Aurora> 6and it's easy to play, no one's there
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<Aurora> 6I get such a headache off the graphics though, one of the main reasons I'm not buying one
*Light_Latias 12shrugs
<NightSeas> 12You can turn off the 3D
<Light_Latias> 12even with my sensetive eyes, I'm fine after hours of playing it o.o
<Aurora> 6ok
<Aurora> 6that's one thing I don't understand
<Aurora> 6WHY pay 300 dollars for a system
<Aurora> 6to turn the 3D off lol
<NightSeas> 12Because the 3D is not what makes the games so awesome. It’s the games themselves.
<nickstr> but on most games if you shut off the 3D you are screwed
<Light_Latias> 12Roara
<nickstr> due to perspective related stuff
<Light_Latias> 12why buy a DSi if you never plan on using the camera
<Aurora> 6the whole point of these games is to enjoy them in 3D
<Aurora> 6which I understand
<Aurora> 6internet
<Light_Latias> 12for the games
<Light_Latias> 12the camera is a perk
<Light_Latias> 12as is 3D
<Aurora> 6internet
<Light_Latias> 12not essential
<Aurora> 6internet
<Aurora> 6I ignore the camera
<Aurora> 6but the price on the 3DS is so ridiculous
<Chimera> 04yes it is
*Light_Latias 12nods
<Skylands> 10Oh, Aurora: Not sure if you care, but I found a gif like the one in your TST sig that's not as close up and a bit smaller, if you want to use it :P </random>
<nickstr> so is the headache inducing 3D
<Aurora> 6that would be awesome
<Aurora> 6Angel gave that one to me
<Aurora> 6but yeh it's big xD
<NightSeas> 12Eww DS cameras
<Chimera> 04^
<Skylands> 10http://i52.tinypic.com/2uii2oy.gif
<Aurora> 6hmm, that's pretty zoomed out though
<Aurora> 6like, more than I thought xD
<Aurora> 6I'll stick with mine
<Skylands> 10k
<Aurora> 6derp homura in the back
<Skylands> 10Stealing Kyoko's spotlight, that's her job
<HyperMetalLugia> Ewww 3DS haters ;p
<Aurora> 6she be trollin
<Aurora> 6I don't hate the 3DS
<Aurora> 6I'm actually extremely jealous
<Aurora> 6I just can't stand that price lol
<Chimera> 04Eww assumers ;P
<Chimera> 04Roara
<Kosoveon> it's definitely worth buying
<Chimera> 04unless you're lucky the 3D hurts you
<Kosoveon> i can understand if you wanna wait
<Ihrida> I only want a 3DS for the GB games like Link's Awakening DX and for Ocarina of Time 3D.
<Chimera> 04I'm ADDICTED to it XD
<Kosoveon> but I actually find the 3D to be awesome
<Light_Latias> 12LOL
<Aurora> 6the Wii was a full consol, not a handheld, and it was the same price lol
<Ihrida> Does it still hurt you if you turn the 3D off?
<HyperMetalLugia> Obviously not XD
<Kosoveon> no
<Kosoveon> XD
<Aurora> 6no
<Ihrida> I played one with the 3D on, and it looked like I had crossed my eyes. xD
<Aurora> 6and the 3D isn't that bad, but yeah I can't go long with it
<Ihrida> You never know, things give off weird waves nowadays, man.
<Chimera> 04The 3DS is presumably as powerful as the Wii
<Aurora> 6that's essentially what it's doing, you know that right?
<Sathi> evening just a short question
<Ray||Homework> 02Ohai Ihrida~
<Ihrida> Ohai Ray. XD
<Chimera> 04and Roara yes actually that's what the 3DS does
*Ray||Homework goes back to homework
<Chimera> 04it takes two images and makes one go to each eye
<HyperMetalLugia> Most of the games look like GC or worse than PS2 lol
<Ihrida> Yay, I made a friend. : D
<Barry> Evening.
<HyperMetalLugia> But eh :o
<Light_Latias> 12they're still starting out, Hyper
<Sathi> One of sitemanagement online?
<Chimera> 04^
<Light_Latias> 12unless it goes the way of the Virtual Boy
<Kosoveon> i was skeptical about the 3ds before it came out too
<Light_Latias> 12it'll get better
<prince-dari> Hmm?
<Chimera> 04lol no LL
<HyperMetalLugia> Luigi's Mansion 3DS looks good :P
<Kosoveon> but now that I actually own one
<Ihrida> The 3D on Street Fighter just looked like a 2D image floating over a 2D background
<Kosoveon> i'm really happy with it
<Sathi> from the g-mail box :)
<Ihrida> To me, at least.
<Light_Latias> 12lol no what, Chime?
<Sathi> I guess that answers my question
<Light_Latias> 12I meant if it flopped entirely
<Light_Latias> 12not the red/black thing
<prince-dari> Epic win.
<prince-dari> [23:34] <Lambda> my boss was whistling the MLP theme song today
<Sathi> I sent a message through g-mail which got replied. But I wonder what the status of it is
<Light_Latias> 12LOL
<Light_Latias> 12also
<Chimera> 04oh
<Chimera> 04k
<Light_Latias> 12I think I unlocked the boss gauntlet
<Light_Latias> 12o.o
<Chimera> 04and LOL PD
<SilverSonic> I got 2 flames so far
<SilverSonic> nao what
<Chimera> 04the theme song is one of the many things that kills the show for me
<Light_Latias> 12the key
<Light_Latias> 12keep going foward
<Light_Latias> 12forward*
<SilverSonic> kk
<prince-dari> Sorry, I don't know what your email is about.
<Light_Latias> 12putting the Master Sword back looks as stunning as taking it out ^.^
<prince-dari> Chimera: Yeah, I've said before, I cringed every time that song came on when I first started watching, now I sing along with it.
<prince-dari> The show tends to grow on you the more you watch it.
<Light_Latias> 12lol
<Chimera> 04HOW XD
<prince-dari> I don't know. XD
<Chimera> 04also THE NAMES
<Sathi> it was about a timer for the EU / US show
<Chimera> 04They are HORRIFIC
<Light_Latias> 12they infused it with caffeine and nicotine
<Sathi> with a countdown or something
<Light_Latias> 12it hypes you up and hooks you
<Chimera> 04LOL!
*Light_Latias 12hides
<prince-dari> I like the names. :P
*Light_Latias 12suddently puts her head in her garbage can and makes noises
<Light_Latias> 12I just saw
<Light_Latias> 12the Happy Mask Salesman
<Light_Latias> 12in 3D
<prince-dari> A timer that counts down to what?
*Light_Latias 12loses her lunch
<Light_Latias> 12that
<Light_Latias> 12is
<Chimera> 04prince-dari
<Light_Latias> 12just
<Light_Latias> 12SCARY
<Sathi> to when the show starts of course
<Chimera> 04"pinkey pie" is NOT A NAME
<prince-dari> Pinkie Pie is awesome. :P
<prince-dari> Pinkamena Diane Pie is her full name.
<Chimera> 04as a character I heard she is awesome
<Chimera> 04but that name is
<SirSprinkles> 6We were considering having a clock of some form...
<Chimera> 04gross

<SilverSonic> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, we'd need DCD to put it on the site.
<Light_Latias> 12I literally felt sick
<Chimera> 04yet I liked it as a kid
<Light_Latias> 12when I saw him
<Chimera> 04I always hated the theme though
<Light_Latias> 12that face
<Chimera> 04so if I ever end up liking MLP (NO)
<Helanga> 12Chimera has a face?
<Light_Latias> 12is more possessed than any Redead...
<Light_Latias> 12no
<Chimera> 04I'll most likely hate the song with a burning passion
<Light_Latias> 12well
<Chimera> 04...
<Chimera> 04LOL
<Light_Latias> 12maybe

<drf-Droid> prince-dari, wtf?
<Light_Latias> 12the most powerful Redead still has its ability
<drf-Droid> rebooting cannot fix a broken keyboard, for example
<prince-dari> Well I mean if the keyboard isn't being registered as there by the computer.
<Helanga> 12how do you know it's the keyboard itself though
<Barry> I was there for both last time
<eXAKR> Hmmm>
<drf-Droid> that's why I said to run mskey
<drf-Droid> that will let you know
<Helanga> 12too lazy
<Barry> well, I missed part of Friday's so couldn't join the raffle
<Barry> I hope to do so this Friday
<Barry> Saturday*
<drf-Droid> but you're not too lazy to change your name?
<ChaoHerba> 3on my laptop, whenever i turn fix the volume using the buttons, it always gets stuck
<prince-dari> eXAKR: Someone told me that that series was really good.
<drf-Droid> /nick Helanga is more letters than mskey
<Helanga> 12nickchange doesn't involve installing software
<drf-Droid> mskey is built into Windows.
<eXAKR> ChaoHerba: probably the keyboard driver is corrupted, if they are on the keyboard
<eXAKR> Otherwise, *shrugs*
<ChaoHerba> 3*sigh* so much technical talk
<eXAKR> prince-dari: yeah
<drf-Droid> what brand laptop is it
<Helanga> 12then how come i can't find any trace of it
