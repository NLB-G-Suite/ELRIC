<Woodenfan> hang on
<Woodenfan> gonna fix up my audio issues
<Ninjazz> RAWRity: Have fun.
<WallDives> Om: short version is "belligerent", except that Belligerent refers to a group, Bellicose refers to a singular individual.

<RustyMeat> inb4 major dick move
<Om> WallDives: I see.
<TheRainbowDash> Shizuka: That'll just be translated as the night sky then.
<Ninjazz> I'm getting such a Assisin's Creed vibe.
<RAWRity> Just remember, if you at all want to help promote anime in the US: WATCH TOONAMI TONIGHT.
<twilight_sprinkler> "the people are revolting!"
<RAWRity> Or like, turn to the channel and leave your TV on or something.
<Ninjazz> RAWRity: WILL DO! *salutes*
<CCCP> there should be a show that has an episode where the main character becomes a prostitute and has sex with a blind guys seeing eye dog
<WallDives> so, a person cant be belligerent, they can be bellicose. Like me, apparently.
<Shizuka> 13how do i do that rawrity if i don't have tv

*CCCP hugs Ninjazz anyway
<RAWRity> BL? Black Lagoon? The show with the dub that said "fuck" 250+ times in 25 episodes?
<CriticKitten> You realize that turning on your TV for Toonami doesn't "count", right? That they base ratings on the handful of people who receive booklets for that purpose? :P
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care everypony, I'll be off for a bit.
<CCCP> bye Everlasting_Joy
<Wrek> 05Ninjazz you do that via PM
<WallDives> later Everlasting_Joy.
<Ninjazz> No, this is proof that Toonami comes back
<Biglaw> Hey everypony I'm back!
<Wrek> 05i meant asking permission silly
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: i would have assumed with the proliferation of cable and satellite set tops that they would derive metrics directly from that
<Ninjazz> Oh...
<WallDives> Ninjazz: we all know it comes back. you dont need to prove it.
<Ninjazz> Oh...
<SirGanjalf> So when's Toonami starting in CET?

<ProudToBeABrony> Yahooz: right :)
<Woodenfan> DRAGONS? well, there goes any credibility this show had
<OMB|OompaLoompa> My cousins are out fighting dragons and what do I get? Guard duty.
<ProudToBeABrony> whats the plot
<Dan_> DeathStar: we probably dont even play in the same realm
<DitzyHooves> why not ride the dragons over?
<FlareChaser> http://flarechaserxoctavia.deviantart.com/ made a group, be proud guys.
<Wrek> 05Woodenfan: where were you for the shade? or the draugr?
<owlicious> OMB|OompaLoompa: you got lucky, you skipped the arrow

<RyunosukeKnT> no, that is umm
<Wrek> 05ProudToBeABrony: why risk an episode getting removed and you wont find it than just download the whole seasons instead in 1080p?
<Ninjazz> You shouldn't love Hasbro, but you should appreciate them.
<RyunosukeKnT> who is that?
<ProudToBeABrony> Wrek: true
<RyunosukeKnT> rather, what is her name?
<GabeMoist> Wrek, hard drive space

<Woodenfan> My torrents have sound issues (it might be VLC Player though
<Darkts3> OH NOES

<cachi01> xD
<ProudToBeABrony> Ryunosuke: We all do :P
<owlicious> lol
<Wrek> 05ProudToBeABrony: if a stream isnt streaming a scheduled event, the streamer may stream whatever he likes. so basically demanding different content outside of scheduled events are futile.
<Darkts3> Deadeagle: do you not have interwebs?
<Wrek> 05Deadeagle: and i cant draw.
<Meanwhile> A real spy would admit to being a spy.
<WallDives> ^
<ProudToBeABrony> Wrek: i see
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: im a spy
<Ninjazz> Lies!
<cachi01> every mans browser history is in blank if u know what i mean

<Yahooz> Shamroc: for lemons
<Wrek> 05however a man may ask nicely and make a request of soemtihng to show afterwards
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: for the Welsh.
<Airpuff|Tipsy> Meanwhile: A real spy would never have to admit that he was a spy xD
<Shamroc> Meanwhile..who?
<Deadeagle> wrek: you cant draw? but...but http://wreky.deviantart.com/
<ProudToBeABrony> TheRainbowDash: I know right
<Wrek> 05yes GabeMoist: when demanding it is futile
<Shamroc> Deadeagle: he ment he cant draw now
<SirGanjalf> three words: Chrome incognito mode
<TheRainbowDash> Deadeagle: Out of sarcasm.
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: the Welsh! The folks who live in Wales.
<Deadeagle> shamroc derp
<ingwaz> Wrek: if i may, i have something i think everyone will enjoy, of course to be shown afterwards

<WallDives> bye ProudToBeABrony.
<DeathStar> RyunosukeKnT: and minors!
<ingwaz> Wrek: ?
<GabeMoist> Wrek, if one wanted a streamer (Val) to stream Pre-G4 MLP, they would demand G4
<doughnutjoe> its like im the only one who knows how to delete history in my neighbor hood -_-
<FlutterTree_> Ok, fixed that problem, sorry to whoever had the name I was using, I didn't even realize this name was being used XD

<Meanwhile> Hugs.
<Darkts3> whoaaaaaaaaaaaaa

<Yahooz> time for teh butt wreking
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Still don't know?
<RyunosukeKnT> I was Frozen today!
<Nerom> Sneaky but sex
<Wrek> 05GabeMoist: not the same. the point at hand is that the streamer decides, and makign demands to change what the streamer wants to stream will only casue the streamer to dislike you. comparing vals troll sprees to chat manners when it comes to requesting content is just silly.
<AlienEd27> no way
<ingwaz> the crap is she doing...
<Deadeagle> .-.
<ProudToBeABrony> stop moving
<TheRainbowDash> Ninjazz: Yes, a bit.
<Meanwhile> Shamroc: The fact that you mistook "implied" for "employed"
<SirGanjalf> oh my!
<owlicious> wreked.
<DerpyDarro> Brave people dont have to be smart
<Ninjazz> Oh mai...
<ProudToBeABrony> hes not done yet

<ProudToBeABrony> well then

<Deadeagle> SEDUCTION!
<GabeMoist> Wrek, Alright then, I wasn't being entirely serious
<Wrek> 05but I was
<Ninjazz> TheRainbowDash: Perhaps I should say one eyebrow :S
<FlutterTree_> And after our vision turned away, they had much butt fun
<Yahooz> Wrek: Of course, if a streamer approves of the request, then they will most likely stream it
<Darkts3> =/
<Darkts3> i missed it
<Yahooz> Thats a given
<RyunosukeKnT> that freeze
<owlicious> why doesn't the streamer with Caramel stream more g4?
<Yahooz> For example, LadyCanary requested to Sumica to stream episodes of Squid Girl, and Sumica did so

<DeathStar> HatsuneMikuFan: Everlasting_Joy told him to say that
<ingwaz> WallDives: unless they decide to actually start respecting mega man again

<Om> panda: IRL >.>
<WallDives> besides, UMvC3 is at the end of its sale cycle.
<Cypresswolf> I havent had a scare to top last months Fallout run where I found those Blind Deathclaws :D

<ingwaz> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: not necessarily, i usually like to play solo as i obviously cannot control other players and they may have different goals when theyre playing than i do. not to mention playing with other people requires that you set aside a decent amount of time to do so.
<Om> Ninjazz: That was just a odd thing to say.
<GabeMoist> Toonami's coming back? Better hook up with Saturn

<Saturn> 08,01attention bronystate: we will from now on be using a base-muffin numeral system

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Saturn: i have no idea what ur first one meant
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol Saturn
<Phobos2390> Saturn: So its a base 5? so 6 would be 10, 7 would be 11, 8 would be 12, 9 would be 1many, 10 would be 1pie, and 11 would be 1muffin?
<Saturn> 08,01Phobos2390: no no, base muffin
*Om gets uncomfortably close to Ninjazz "Like what che see?"
<GabeMoist> Is it similar to base Pi?

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phobos2390: 666 is the answer to all
<Om> Ninjazz: I know what I have, but what you did. Well thats something
<ingwaz> on the one hand...i feel slightly intoxicated, i find walking, typing, and other things that normally require no focus to actually require some, on the other hand, my thoughts seem to be completely coherent and i don't really feel much different mentally...
<HatsuneMikuFan> L4D2 anyone?
<Saturn> 08,01Phobos2390: 13_10 = lots . muffins_muffin
<Phobos2390> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: So what is 666's meaning again?
<hen3ry> What is the meaning of life? 666. No, afraid that doesn't work either.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phobos2390: the devil
<Phobos2390> why again?
<Saturn> 08,01i expressed it as a scalar product for clarity.

<Woodenfan> I hope the episode "a derp in the life" is gonna be real. It'd be awesome: A SILENT DERPY EPISODE
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phobos2390: in real life
<Woodenfan> I doubt it though :(
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phobos2390: its reference to satan
<Phobos2390> huh?
<DeathStar> Phobos2390: in the an awesome song
<Saturn> 08,01Alicorn_Prince_Shane: no no, it's spelled "saturn"

<DeathStar> hi Merc_Xephos
<ingwaz> MahBoi777: perhaps it would be best if i were to lay down and ponder the meaning of life and the universe while conversing with myself in a devils advocate fashion in order to give both sides of the potential argument the proper respect that they deserve
<HatsuneMikuFan|Halo> Hi Merc_Xephos
<GabeMoist> Saturn, looking them up
<Merc_Xephos> it has been a while since last time i was on

<Dark92Enigma> just refreshed......nothing happens
<Om> Ninjazz: What great reactions you have by the way.
<hen3ry> hmm. I should eat. But to eat, I must cook. And to cook, I must first clean dishes. And to clean dishes, I must get off my flank. Damn.
<DeathStar> Merc_Xephos: i havent seen you in AGES!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Nope no maintenance here
<Ninjazz> Om: What do you mean? :|
<MahBoi777> ingwaz: oh my.....O_o

<Cobellanez> Nope sorry TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Om> Ninjazz: Ha. Silly question
<Phobos2390> Hen3ry: I know. It's a hard life being in a first world country ain't it
<Dark92Enigma> Oh that explains everything
<Ninjazz> Om: I hate you. :|
<hen3ry> seriously. #firstworldproblems indeed.
<hen3ry> sigh
<ingwaz> hen3ry: i suggest graham crackers, they require no cooking and are generally delicious
<Om> Ninjazz: Goood
*Ninjazz punches Om's shoulder
<Om> Ninjazz: ohh~ So strong you are.
<Saturn> 08,01there's a species called the Io moth
<hen3ry> yeah, but I have about as much food as that dude from the airplane time machine movie. And my time machine always changes history whenever I take it to the store.
<Merc_Xephos> *gets 9mm pistol*
<Saturn> 08,01their caterpillars have venomous spines on them
<GabeMoist> Saturn, after looking them up, I do have to agree that the Comet Moth is pretty awesome looking

<Phobos2390> saturn: Darn spiders
<Phobos2390> Which reminds me
<GabeMoist> I suppose you should keep those plants away from the,
<DeathStar> need child poison? better hook up with saturn
<Om> Ninjazz: Don't take it so personally.

<Ninjazz> Om: Yes, I have been doing alot of things for fun.
<Ninjazz> Om: I have... cake.
<Cobellanez> Are you there Nittany_Discord?
<Om> Ninjazz: I had pie.
<Phobos2390> Saturn: there's a trope about creatures that should be feared. Like the redeads in Zelda, or the Darknuts, or behemoths in FFIV.
<Ninjazz> Om: Not sure where I'm going with this one. :S
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe.
<Cobellanez> I saw your post on Moonstuck :P
<MahBoi777> pie vs. cake......how epic
<Om> Ninjazz: Well, I really did have pie.
<Merc_Xephos> i still have my gun
<Ninjazz> Om: And I don't have cake. :D
<Phobos2390> MahBoi777: Did someone say cake?
<Om> Ninjazz: I guess I win
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I got another Moonstuck question answered?
<Cobellanez> Yep
<Ninjazz> MahBoi777: Here is a fact. Cake = Lie. Pie = Truth.
<Phobos2390> Ninjazz: Of course not. The cake is a lie.
<ingwaz> MahBoi777: well...i think i'll go lay down now and ponder the meaning of life, the universe and everything
<Ninjazz> I said that on a TF2 server and EVERYONE agreed.
<Phobos2390> ingwaz: 42.
<cachi01|GhostRecon> HatsuneMikuFan|Halo: in MP there is a teaser lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Awesome.
*Ninjazz pats Om on the back "I guess you win again, buddy"
<MahBoi777> ingwaz: very well, take all the time you need
*Cobellanez applauds Nittany_Discord great luck skill

*Cobellanez claps
<Phobos2390> The first person to prove that cow's milk is drinkable was very, very thirsty.
<Ninjazz> Chat likes derping on me. :S
<Phobos2390> If you have trouble with simple counting, use the following mnemonic device: One comes before two, comes before sixty, comes after twelve, comes before six trillion, comes after five hundred and four. This will make your earlier counting difficulties seem like no big deal.
<Om> Ninjazz: Not the only one.
<Gunthler> MahBoi777: lolwut happened in that room? :D
<Ninjazz> Guess we all share the same boat. :S
<MahBoi777> Phobos2390: where would I find such a device?
<MahBoi777> Gunthler: I have no idea O_o
<Phobos2390> Avocados have the highest fiber and calories of any fruit. They are found in Australians.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I should contact Egophiliac and thank her for the funny responses.
<MahBoi777> I tried a mango for the first time yesterday

<Midnight_Tempest> egophiliac? hmm... i have one of her pics as my background...

<Phobos2390> "In Victorian England, a commoner was not allowed to look directly at the Queen due to a belief at the time that the poor had the ability to steal thoughts. Science now believes that less than four percent of poor people are able to do this."

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> yesh? lol jks
<Phobos2390> Marie Curie invented the theory of radioactivity, the treatment of radioactivity and dying of radioactivity.

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> im just curious thats all Ninjazz
<Cobellanez> Shimmy shimmy shimmy
<Ninjazz> Tbh, Shane... I like the pegasus better. Alicors are WAY too OP to be used as OCs.
<Cobellanez> How do you invent death by radiation?
<MahBoi777> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I like the first one personally, just saiyan
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> k Ninjazz
<Phobos2390> Before the invention of scrambled eggs in 1912, the typical breakfast was either whole eggs, still in the shell, or scrambled rocks.
<MahBoi777> hmmmm

<OmegaMetroidBrony> That breakfast fact seems legit

<Scoonami> 00,03My childhood...
<HatsuneMikuFan|Halo> Dken2021: Yeah because Bleach in Japan ended I believe
<Phobos2390> When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade. Make life take back the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down! WITH THE LEMONS! I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that BURNS YOUR HOUSE DOWN!
<Midnight_Tempest> HatsuneMikuFan|Halo: bleach is not ok... i watched it until they finally be Aizen and i was bored to tears with the amount of filler they had... it was DBZ with half the yelling...

<Phobos2390> I NEED IT!
<Ponies47> MahBoi777: You want you want?
<CriticKitten> No it's not.
<RAWRity> Really, my biggest issue is that, after having Orihime build up the idea that she was going to get stronger and be able to fight alongside her friends, her character ended up just crying for Ichigo (who at the time was pretty much DEAD), to save her.
<CriticKitten> I'm 25 and remember it fondly. >_>

<Phobos2390> If x = 1 and y = 1Then 2(x2 - y2) = 0And 5(x – y) = 0Which is to say, 2(x2 - y2) = 5(x – y)Now divide each side of this equation by (x-y): [2(x2 - y2) = 5(x – y)] / (x – y)Which comes to 2(x + y) = 5But (x + y) = (1 + 1)Which means that 2*2 = 5.
<Woodenfan> eeeeeeeh
<Midnight_Tempest> i choose option 3, im gonna play some more Diablo 3
<Om> MahBoi777: Huzza!
<RAWRity> DitzyHooves: that was because Toonami was dying, and couldn't afford the liscensing rights for their shows.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> stream plz Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13Phobos2390: you divided by zero
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Damn you mysterious seal chest!
<Woodenfan> toonami's pretty boring
<Dken2021> Phobos2390, why are you deriving in the chat?
<Phobos2390> Shizuka: EEYUP.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Phobos2390: Are you saying we should obey Big Brother?
<Shizuka> 13Phobos2390: if you divide by x-y, which is zero, then you fail
<GabeMoist> Shizuka, why can't we all just play a civilized game of civilization
<Gunthler> Shizuka: I want to see kirz stream Civ5
<HatsuneMikuFan|Halo> When I play Halo 3 people are always serious
<Litwick> OBEY WARIO, DESTROY MARIO
<Phobos2390> Scoot-Scootaloo: What?
<DitzyHooves> they should show Fairy Tale, One Peice on Toonami
<Gunthler> If he wants ofc
<cachi01|GhostRecon> wow i love how ghost recon is not just a run and shoot game
<Phobos2390> Shizuka: I know.
<MahBoi777> I like One Piece (subbed)
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Sorry Scoot-Scootaloo but my allegiance is to Big Sister Rarity...
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane slaps OmegaMetroidBrony
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Ow ;A;
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03In the book 1984, the Inner Party forces someone to think 2*2=5
<RAWRity> DitzyHooves: Fariy Tail's probably not gonna happen. Too highly hyped for them to be able to afford it right now.
<Phobos2390> Women require time and money (Women = Time * Money). Time is money (Women = Money * Money = Money ^ 2). Money is the root of all evil (Money ^ 2 = Evil). Therefore, Women = Evil.
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane cuts OmegaMetroidBrony s cheek
<Shizuka> 13Scoot-Scootaloo: they don't force, you accept it
<DitzyHooves> would also like if they show Code Geass
<OmegaMetroidBrony> ;A;
<Dken2021> lol Phobos2390
<RAWRity> Notice, the only 2 new shows are stuff dubbed on the cheap by Funi
<HatsuneMikuFan|Halo> cachi01|GhostRecon: It's great isn't it?
<Phobos2390> Since evil is negative, money is thus imaginary.
<Shizuka> 13Phobos2390: there is a problem with your premise that money is the root of all evil
<Woodenfan> Scoot-Scootaloo: You're REEEEEEEEEEEALLY into this Communism schtick. Why?
<cachi01|GhostRecon> HatsuneMikuFan|Halo: I LOVE IT
<Phobos2390> If evil is negative than Evil ^ 2 is positive or good so two wrongs make a right and a woman is two wrongs
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Scoot-Scootaloo: is a communist DUH
<Woodenfan> If money's the root of all evil, why do we have jobs?
<DitzyHooves> Shizuka, Atlas Shrugged?
<Dken2021> to become evil?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03After I read 1984, the world seems to make more sense~
<Shizuka> 13eeeeeeyup
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Dem commies be takin' away all our freedoms Jesus gave us >: (
<RAWRity> Can I just say? FUCK Atlas Shrugged
<Shizuka> 13why so?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3sound coming through?
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/google-employees-create-beer-dispensing-kegdroid/
<RAWRity> It's is a horribly written book.
<HatsuneMikuFan|Halo> Scoot-Scootaloo: damn commies
<MahBoi777> Woodenfan: so......jobs are evil?
<Phobos2390> And the addition: I am nobody. Nobody's perfect. Therefore I'm perfect. But only God is perfect, so A God Am I. Oh dear, I'm blind!
<Dken2021> yep sound is live kirzstryfe
<Woodenfan> yeah MahBoi
<WallDives> I see stream and sound.
<Merc_Xephos> wut is dis
<Dken2021> and looks like some civ
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Voices O_O
<WallDives> and I hear two people.
<Shizuka> 13aw looks like kirz beat me
<Shizuka> 13not that i was trying hard..
<Phobos2390> Merc_Xephos: Sparta
<MahBoi777> ^
<cachi01|GhostRecon> ^^
<CupcakeWarrior> Ooh, whos voice is this and what game is this?
<Gunthler> I wanted to see gameplay of Civ5 anyway, I liked Civ4 so i planned on getting it.
<RAWRity> YOu do not just STOP your story for 60 god damn pages just so you can explain blunt-force-trauma style your entire philosophy to the reader.
<Phobos2390> Power corrupts. Knowledge is power. Study hard. Be evil
<Shizuka> 13galt's speech chapter invalidates the rest of the book, got it
<cachi01|GhostRecon> Phobos2390: school is knowledge knowledge is greed greed is evil
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Ignorance is Strength!
<cachi01|GhostRecon> Phobos2390: so school is evil!
<MahBoi777> ohai CupcakeWarrior!
<CupcakeWarrior> Wasnt that speech basically the author's opinion or something RAWRity?
*Phobos2390 hugs CupcakeWarrior
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Freedom is Slavery
<WallDives> ignorant and happy, or knowledgable and miserable?
<CupcakeWarrior> Anyway, whos voices are those?
<RAWRity> It's not about "invalidating" anything. It's that it's just a poorly written book that is more interested in preaching to its reader than telling a story.
<Phobos2390> "The more you learn, the more you know. The more you know, the more you forget. The more your forget, the less you know. Therefore, the more you learn, the less you know."
<Shizuka> 13it's well known that galt's speech was intended as rand's objectivism dump than as useful to the narrative
<GabeMoist> who's talking on the stream?
<RAWRity> Not to mention Rand's writing style is stilted like hell.
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: yes.
<Shamroc> GabeMoist: me and Kirakura
<Woodenfan> I like 1984, but I'm glad the events of the book never happened in the actual year 1984.
<Shamroc> GabeMoist: me and kirz...derp
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Your eyes betray you, don't trust them
<WallDives> I need to get some sleep, see you guys a couple of days.
<DeathStar> hay Satern are you still here? I have something relevent to your interests
<WallDives> bye all.
<CupcakeWarrior> Is this Civ?
<Darkts33> oh Civ 5
<DeathStar> hay Saturn are you still here? I have something relevent to your interests
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03No, its Age of Empires 3
<Om> WallDives came back? And left... Bye then
<CupcakeWarrior> Scoot-Scootaloo: Which reminds me, I think I still have AoE 2 somewhere
<Phobos2390> Robert Pattinson played both Cedric and Edward, so Cedric = Edward. Voldemort killed Cedric, so Voldemort > Cedric = Edward. Harry Potter killed Voldemort, so Harry Potter > Lord Voldemort > Cedric = Edward. Edward Cullen is synonymous with Twilight, so Harry Potter > Lord Voldemort > Cedric = Edward = Twilight. Therefore, Harry Potter > Twilight.
<Gunthler> I like ane ambiance in civ games.
<Gunthler> I like the ambiance in sid meier's civ games.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Welp, I'm off to bed. Night y'all~

<Gunthler> Night Scoot-Scootaloo
<RAWRity> Phobos2390: you could just say that the last HP book sold more than the entire Twilight Saga combined.
<RAWRity> That would suffice.
<Phobos2390> If love is blind and God is love, and Ray Charles is blind, then God plays the piano.
<Gunthler> kirzstryfe: What era are you guys playing in currently?

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> and start trolling
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not as fun as pretending to be a maid here.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> its not me
<FlootahShy> Shoulda guessed it.
<RAWRity> Canadian_Brony: hour where everybody puts Maid in their usernam.
<Mutterguy> ...But without the dice
<RAWRity> and dust stuff
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're had people coming in here thinking this is an RP channel.
<Ponies47> I wasen't here for Maid Hour
<Ninjazz> I was considering being a maid... :(
<Canadian_Brony> RAWRity that's amazing
<superretroworld> we got hi5s as brohoofs, so we should create something for hugs
<RAWRity> Canadian_Brony: too bad you missed it.
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane hands Nittany_Discord a cookie
<RAWRity> That feel when you'll never get to experience Maid Hour
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane gives 2 cookies to Shizuka
*Nittany_Discord 11,01noms cookie.
<Om> I was a maid once, then I took to much RP to the everywhere.
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, if Maid Hour returns you should do a stream of Dust Force
<Canadian_Brony> superretroworld I think it's called a "glomp", but I don't know if you guys glomp here
<Ninjazz> "Ninjamaid" or "Jazzmaid" would have been mah name.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maid hour is my favorite hour.
<MahBoi777> lol
<Ninjazz> We glomp.
<Ninjazz> We glomp alot.
<Gunthler> We glomp.

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> and romp
<MahBoi777> awwwww shit AMERiCA
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Nittany_Discord: how u mean help people out
*Ninjazz bonks Gunthler with a rolled up newspaper
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some people are holding a fundraiser event soon.

<Mutterguy> Screw Maid hour then...Day of Maids....
<MahBoi777> MERICA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I proposed an idea that if we raised about $2k, I would wear a maid outfit while streaming.
<superretroworld> MahBoi777: ikr, totally beats hot weather
<Ninjazz> LOL
<GabeMoist> oh mai
<Canadian_Brony> MahBoi777 move to Canada, where our 4 seasons are Winter, Still Winter, Almost Winter, and Road Construction
<Canadian_Brony> legit
<durger> lol
<MahBoi777> :D
<Ponies47> mmmmm bombs you want it? It's yours my friend.
<FlootahShy> I recieved the sidden urge to donate.
<FlootahShy> sudden
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Problem is, I can't find the money to make that happen.
<FlootahShy> *
<superretroworld> Canadian_Brony: where i live we get the 4 main seasons, your lucky
*Gunthler vacuums Nittany_Discord
<GabeMoist> Raise money to get Nittany_Discord a maid outfit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I need money for an outfit, but I haven't been able to get it.
<Canadian_Brony> either way, the roads are stupidly annoying
<Ninjazz> Sounds like a plan.
<StupidSexyCJ> would give money if i had any to give
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane hands Nittany_Discord moniez
<GabeMoist> Everyone! Fund this man!
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Well... CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
<CupcakeWarrior> Everyone, donate
<hen3ry> Try Vegas. We have Cold, Hot and windy, hot as hell, and oh [buy some apples] it's hot.
<CupcakeWarrior> NOW
<HatsuneMikuFan|Skyri> Kinect Skyrim is the greatest thing ever
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That would be nice GabeMoist, but I'd rather you give it to the people we're helping.
<Canadian_Brony> do you take Canadian Tire money?
<RAWRity> also, after looking up the plot synopsis, apparently the Main Character of Casshern Sins kills a girl named Luna. Don't think I can watch this show anymore.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They have harder problems than lack of clothing.
<Ninjazz> Dat Luna
<CupcakeWarrior> RAWRity: I saw the first episode on netflix, I didnt like it
<Canadian_Brony> I don't think he'll be able to buy anything with my money
<Ponies47> I have over $300. But US dollars is worth nothing for Nittany_Discord :(
<Kimori> Heading off, bye all
<Canadian_Brony> Canadian and such
<cachi01|GhostRecon> HatsuneMikuFan|Skyri: the only thing it des is shout sort by name
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01$300 what?
<hen3ry> Canadian_Brony: but your money is worth almost exactly the same amount as ours....
<Ninjazz> Monies.
<FlootahShy> I DEMAND THE STREAMERS SING BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
<MahBoi777> gimme ur moniez
<superretroworld> Canadian_Brony: canadian tire moneys so pointless, and there only in cents
<Kandarihu> What is this game?
<Canadian_Brony> hen3ry all my money can only be used at Canadian Tire
<MahBoi777> FlootahShy: they have before
<hen3ry> I second FlootahShy's Canterlock suggestion
<RAWRity> CupcakeWarrior: can't really pass judgement right now. Right now it's definitely got a problem with the art design. It's really, really bizarre seeing a modern day anime with 80's art style.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ponies47: If you want to *shrug*
*FlootahShy sadface.
<HatsuneMikuFan|Skyri> cachi01|GhostRecon: No, I can say FUS RO DUH into my TV

<FlootahShy> Suddenly, you are floating through space with only a space suit on, you are extremely hungry, and a five-star meal is floating right next to you. the only way to retrieve it is to take your suit off. What Do?
<Om> Gunthler: Not me, this is for Ninjazz.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> FlootahShy: wouldnt u die as soon as u take the suit off?
<Polydunami> Wait, I wasn't talking about myself there
<hen3ry> FlootahShy: Open suit, die, dine in hell.
<Gun_Dealer_Xephos> i am going 2 sleep
<Ninjazz> Om: o_o
<Rex_Mundi> Cant wait till Gods and Kings expansion comes out, Civ 5 as it is now just kinda seems... incomplete. Like its an almost unfinished prodect (but still very enjoyable)

<FlootahShy> HAH
<ShiningArmor> or Well cant i HAVE fun at all lemon -_-
<StupidSexyCJ> panda: im black on the inside
<Om> Gunthler: I have principals. Among other things.
<Ninjazz> panda: Believe it or not, I got some black in my heritage. But I'm mostly white. :$
<Woodenfan> Saw an LP of Story of the Blanks. I'm not gonna sleep tonight :'(
<ShiningArmor> Well it seems you hate the /me Thing
<Ponies47> panda: Silly filly! I'm BLUE! :P
<ShiningArmor> Whats so bad about it?
<Gunthler> Om: Just let her have her way with you. :D
<cachi01|GhostRecon> Woodenfan: LP??
<DeadpoolDash> the voices
<panda> I ask because it has come to my attention that I am the only BLACK BRONY!
<Woodenfan> It's so scary.
<prince-lemon> I don't hate /me, I hate it when people use it as you are.
<ShiningArmor> Its pretty much the same like regular chat
<Rex_Mundi> Western moe has more horsepower. Fluttershy is kawaii DESU DESU DESU! Rainbow Dash is Air Waifu.
<MahBoi777> I'm red
<StupidSexyCJ> panda: JaxBlade bor
<StupidSexyCJ> *bro
<Woodenfan> cachi01|GhostRecon: Familiar Faces did an LP of it, it's still scary

<cachi01|GhostRecon> panda: here in the chat
<StupidSexyCJ> panda: brony youtube star
<Om> Gunthler: Indeed. Would not be me without a bit of goofery.
<Ponies47> Smacks FlootahShy NO VIDEO LINKS :[
<panda> StupidSexyCJ: thank you... I was just feeling alone ^^
<cachi01|GhostRecon> Woodenfan: WHAT DOES LP MEAN?
<Life_Essence> needs more Mount and Blade style fights
<Life_Essence> Let's Play
<cachi01|GhostRecon> LETS PLAY
<Polydunami> Hey panda, why feel alone because of the colour of your skin?
<cachi01|GhostRecon> OK THX

<superretroworld> cachi01|GhostRecon: means lets plays

<Gunthler> Ninjazz: How about dat gilDash? :D
<cachi01|GhostRecon> Woodenfan: come on LP are fun!!
<StupidSexyCJ> panda: no prob
<Ninjazz> Gunthler: How bout dat TheRainbowDash? :S
<cachi01|GhostRecon> Woodenfan: and story of the blanks isnt that scary
<Woodenfan> I tried watching NintendoCapriSun, but he has WAY too much toilet humor for my tastes
<superretroworld> Woodenfan: kool, my favourites protonjohn
<Rex_Mundi> The most awsome thing that will never happen is if the Civ series and the Total War series teams up and creates a super stategy game.
<Gunthler> Ninjazz: You got me there. :D
<Woodenfan> HOW ARE YOU CHANGING THE PINGS
<panda> Polydunami: nah i was kidding, i just got made fun of cuz i was the only black guy in the group... like token from south park :D
<Woodenfan> protonjon is cool
<ShiningArmor> >:|
<Polydunami> Oh
<superretroworld> yeah
<FlootahShy> panda: lol
<Ninjazz> Gunthler: :>
<Woodenfan> superretroworld: How'd you change the pings?
<Polydunami> I don't watch much South Park, tbh
<Ponies47> Hugs panda
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami same here
<Om> Ninjazz: That's two wins for you today, you are on a roll.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ShiningArmor: remeber AoP
<superretroworld> Woodenfan: whats a ping?
<Polydunami> I've seen enough to develop a negative opinion
<Ninjazz> Om: Yippee. ;|
<Canadian_Brony> Om who's winning?
<Ninjazz> :|
<Polydunami> And that's all I have to say
<Life_Essence> so who's stream is this?
<Woodenfan> superretroworld: You sent me something, I get a ratatat noise. How'd you do that? It's like a notification noise.
<MahBoi777> Polydunami: I hate South Park too
<Polydunami> I dunno
<Om> Canadian_Brony: Not you that is for sure.
<Rex_Mundi> MahBoi777- I dont know, i like south park, it still manages to be fresh after all this time. Unlike the simpsons and family guy.
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami the only thing I find (remotely) interesting about the show was the Chewbacca reference used in the court
<Polydunami> I think this is a kirz stream
<Ponies47> I really don't like today's Southpark. When that rumor was going around that they where gonna make a episode about making fun of bronies. I agreed I would stop watching South Park if they did.
<superretroworld> Woodenfan: you don it to someone to get there attention, type in there name, not all of it and press tab, you did it to me too
<superretroworld> if you want to get*
<Ninjazz> If they make fun of bronies, we just need to take a joke. We've seen them make fun of EVERYTHING before.
<MahBoi777> Rex_Mundi: the new Family Guy eps DO suck
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 if we raged at Fox News, imagine what it would be like for South Park
<Rain> south park makes fun of everything. If you are offended that they made fun of something you are a part of, then you kinda need a slap to the face
<Polydunami> Pff. Fox News is a joke, as far as I know
<Ponies47> I HATE FOX NEWS! SAYING WE AHVE DISORDERS! :[
<Life_Essence> much like Family Guy
<StupidSexyCJ> I like South Park, sometimes though other people who watch it take it too far
<Ponies47> *HAVE
<hen3ry> agreed. SP makes fun of everything. Being made fun of by them means only that you're _worth_ being poked at in jest.
<turk> fox news the best comedy chanel on tv
<Rain> ^
<StupidSexyCJ> like the Ginger thing
<superretroworld> Ponies47: they attacked us too :(
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ponies47: im just about love and tolerate
<Om> Ponies47: What if you do have a dissorder?
<Ponies47> I don't
<Mutterguy> and that whole scientology fad
<turk> according to fox news we all file for disability and stsy home all day
<Rex_Mundi> Canadian_Brony- Getting fun of by Fox news is almost a badge of honor. FOX is really that bad of a news station, people who dont watch any news know more than those that watch FOX.
<Polydunami> Better watch out for those lawyers
<Life_Essence> This is why I tolerate Aussie TV, it's only sport and crappy news about food killing us
<DeadpoolDash> I am starting to think "The Legend of Korra" should be called "The Legend of Lin"
<hen3ry> faux news. Pfft.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ponies47: my life is based upon the brony motto
<Ninjazz> Faust News would be pretty cool.
<DeadpoolDash> ^that is a hentai
<MahBoi777> ^^
<Life_Essence> fauchs knews
<superretroworld> well im off to bed, night everypony
<Woodenfan> Faust news? :s
<Woodenfan> night superretroworld

<StupidSexyCJ> night superretroworld
<Ponies47> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: My life anything to do with ze ponies
<Polydunami> Goodnight superretroworld :)
<Canadian_Brony> Rex_Mundi I was double offended by their attack. Saying we could take them over with a board and nail puts us at a serious low compared to them, let alone the Brony attack
<Woodenfan> gonna watch some of my torrents. l8r
<FlootahShy> night superrtroworld, hope you dont end up trapped in a room against your will tonight.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol Ponies47

<Canadian_Brony> what is it Gunthler?
<doughnutjoe> im back

<FlootahShy> I politely demand the streamers express their feelings about FOX NEWS.
*Gunthler leans in and says
<Ponies47> DuskStarshimmer: They made fun of us :'(
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Polydunami: off drug running
<Gunthler> I liek Dashie. :3

<StupidSexyCJ> GuntherDW: TELL US
*Ninjazz facehoof

*DuskStarshimmer yawns bigly, "okay Shane", curls up and breaths deeply
<GabeMoist> Fox News is the foxiest news station
<DeadpoolDash> kick ghandi's ass
<Polydunami> Gunthler: Celestia is best pony >:3
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai doughnutjoe
<Ninjazz> He lieks Dashie in more ways than one. >:3
<doughnutjoe> What are we talking about?
<doughnutjoe> Fox news?
*Life_Essence plays Barry White
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey doughnutjoe Spike wants anthor doughtnut! :P
<panda> Oh... did anyone know that toonami is back ^^
<Polydunami> I lost track a long time ago
<DuskStarshimmer> Ponies47, dont forget, most people dont act logically, espeically when god is involved.
*ShiningArmor is a little bored

<Rex_Mundi> Canadian_Brony- I would really like to hear Celestia speek in the ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE! That would be beyond epic. Especially if she does that glowy eye thingy and is visually angry. Really... Celestia and Luna need an episode all to themselvs, that would rock our socks off. Speaking of witch, I like ponies in socks.

<FlareChaser> heeheeheee

<Phase4> 00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, O_O
<Rex_Mundi> StupidSexyCJ- there is a small but growing pony fandom in japan, who knows. MLP might just get an anime version like the powerpuff girls did. The japanese even have their own pony memes. Rainbow dash is nicknammed "Air-Waifu"
<hen3ry> Life_Essence: Not everyone does that. I look back on High School as a torture-filled experience I would never repeat again for any amount of money ever. And that's a long way out from it.
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai Tom
<[wklmeb]JRP2234> ugh im nearly finished my friday parody

<IshMangoPony> but wait theres moar: Not only have I graduated, I've already been accepted into college
<DeathStar> Ponies47: use epic cupcake time
<hen3ry> All I'm saying is, my 20 year reunion is this year. I won't be attending that either.
<Canadian_Brony> FlareChaser I'll take that as an "All of the above". I suggest watching and episode of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, preferably "Lesson Zero"
<Mutterguy> The Autoponies wage battle on the evil forces of Discordians
<MahBoi777> :$
<Ponies47> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Older
<mario_pony> Ponies47: why not?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ponies47: how much older?

<hen3ry> packetsniff the router lolz
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ponies47: u should get some of his secrets like spy on him and black mail him
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> And then Ponies47 finds out that his brother is reading the Twilight saga in secret.
<Major_Frank> Ouch..
<BlueFlare> 02LOL
<drf|laptop> 03well gotta reboot for the updates
<drf|laptop> 03brb
<Major_Frank> Twilight sparkle is best Saga
<Ponies47> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I gotta catch him. While he's watching them so I now. I know he's gonna lay low for a while and not tell me auntil I catch him :)
<Ponies47> *know
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> k Ponies47
<Mutterguy> Odd numbers? as far as i'm concerned so long as I have a knife there is no odd numbers. Judt halves and wholes
<hen3ry> spying on your brother totally embodies everything this fandom is about, of course. :D
<Ponies47> Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: Both my brother and I hate the Twilight movies/books
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ponies47: u should go check on him now
<Major_Frank> Spying your brother is part of growing up for me
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> Ponies47: That's good.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sumica: will u be streaming some time in next 3 hrs?
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> Is it okay if I take off the biohazard suit?
<Ponies47> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: To early. I only showed him Apple.mov about 10 minutes ago.
<Sumica> 00,10doubtfull
<hen3ry> I think the air is safe, Twi. I've only seen four or five ponies breathe and simply drop dead for no apparent reason today.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sumica: sad face so no accel world
<Mutterguy> Shout are you a brony yet? This might lead to failure but you can be certain of the result :P
<Sumica> 00,10it's after midnight here
<DeathStar> Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: no takeing of biohazardsuits!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sumica: so tomorrow then?

<DeathStar> hi Spell-of-Gaming
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> Hello Spell-of-Gaming
<Mutterguy> hai Spell-of-Gaming
<Ponies47> That's what I'm doing. Maybe I should let him come to me
<BlueFlare> 02you were able to update it without problems?
<Spell-of-Gaming> What game is this? :P
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<BlueFlare> 02derp
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://imgur.com/a/I7rfE
<BlueFlare> 02nice
<Tassadork> game is darwinia
<Ponies47> DeathStar: O yeah dat one rule. I was making corrections close one
<drf|laptop> 03the new icons are nice and rainbow colored :P
<hen3ry> iiiiiidea. Is possible to have field above the stream that describes what is actually being streamed?
<Spell-of-Gaming> hen3ry: It's possible.
<Ponies47> Has backed off and is waiting to see if his brother will come to him.
<HatefulWrath> woo hoo my fanfic got added to FimFiction http://www.fimfiction.net/story/28435/1/Sticky-Bucket-O-Fun/
<Ponies47> and tell him he likes ponies :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> but it should be update by mods constantly
<DeathStar> hen3ry: it might be a nusince to the streamers though
<Spell-of-Gaming> They used to have a huge banner above the stream to tell when's the next pony episode coming.
<Malavolent> HatefulWrath: Adult content? :|
<hen3ry> hm
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> CrimsonPhoenix: LEGASP
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> CrimsonPhoenix: was the pony discord initally like ...
<Ponies47> I may have lied to him a bit about the ponies about the things they do. But we will see
<Sumica> 00,10that would require us knowing when the next pony ep is too
<junh1024-XD> http://blogs.adobe.com/brandexperience/2012/05/16/the-cs6-desktop-brand-system/
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ponies47: how so?
<Shizuka> 13which won't be for months anyway
<junh1024-XD> ^ shows some nice prototype splashes
<Shizuka> 13so, that was a level of darwinia, but i can already tell no one found the darwinians escorting a soul as touching as i do
<hen3ry> True, but even for things like this, some simple interface that would let the mods change one line of dynamic text. "What is streaming now:" $string[50]
<CrimsonPhoenix> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: It has be told that Discord and Celestia had something before, by fans but still
<Sumica> 00,10it's been laging the whole way for me
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> LEGASP 0_o
<Ponies47> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: After I showed him Apple.mov I told him that's how they acted :P Besides he wasen't watching when I showed him Lesson Zero. So he doesn't know what the animation looks like :P
<Ponies47> (evil laugh)
<Shizuka> 13output is solid as always here
<Tassadork> Shizuka well you made me want to play darwinia =P
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> real men open their eyes when ponies are on
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sumica: hows ur game going
<Sumica> 00,10we stoped
<Ponies47> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: He had his eyes open for Apple.Mov But he was looking away during Lesson Zero :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would still love to see a flashback with Discord
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ponies47: i was refering to lesson zeo
<hen3ry> lesson zero isn't a good first episode. It's only really hilarious when you understand the characters a bit better.
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, it takes as long as usual to open the programs :p
<Shizuka> 13so, would people be interested in seeing more of darwinia?
<Ponies47> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I know he sucks he watched the part when Fluttershy killed the bear but that's really it. :P So he's not fully a true man just yet. :|
<BlueFlare> 02well, it's a pretty powerful program derp
<Mutterguy> 'Season 3: coming in September or October we hope!' is not an awe inspiring banner
<Shizuka> 13at some later time, it's 3am and i need to not miss the l4d2 game tomorrow
<drf|laptop> 03IK know, it's just bloated as frick
<drf|laptop> 03-K
<HatefulWrath> fluttershy wrestling the bear was the best part of the series
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Mutterguy: PONIES are Coming
<yifle1> cant wait for season 3
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sumica: iz u going to bed now?
<Shizuka> 13season 3 is a long ways away people...
<junh1024-XD> well, launch time is alright, compared to some of the other proprietary programs that i use for engineering
<hen3ry> you can wait, and you will wait.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Shizuka: sept oct
<Shizuka> 13it's may... the season won't start until at least september
<Shizuka> 13there's a lot planned between here and there
<Darkts33> when's the game?
<Malavolent> HatefulWrath: What the hell have you written?
<HatefulWrath> lol

<Sumica> 00,10DeathStar got it
<DeathStar> VDXRetrotainment: the one that wall-e watches
*fillyfillyy|mezmoriz is in a trans
<Ninjazz> Hey Sumi.
<Midnight_Tempest> <_< >_>
<junh1024-XD> because they develop for PC, port to xbox (which is similar, platform wise)
<Onyxia> i like trains
<Phase4-> 00,02it was in wall-e
<Ninjazz> Good one, DeathStar.
<VDXRetrotainment> DeathStar: OH SH'T You may be right O.o

<DeathStar> yay I'm cleaver
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> ...:|
<onyx> wat is dis tho
<Sumica> 00,10there is no may be about it
<BlueFlare> 02[02:42] <junh1024-XD> sometimes xbox game are better than PS3 game, for development reasons <-- depends on the game. Most older games look better on the xBox 360. Newer games tend to look better on the PS3
<coyboy> I wonder if client eastwood is in this film
<junh1024-XD> maybe
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> Magical_pablez94: not impressed
<Magical_pablez94> fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: :D it may mean something else trans :D

<Sumica> 00,10Phase4, are you useing that same stream way that Saturn does?
<BlueFlare> 02Like the xBox 360 version of Rayman origins is just a port. The real game is in HD for the PS3
<Magical_pablez94> DeathStar: i think u were right, btw :)
<Phase4-> 00,02Sumica, yeah
<Sumica> 00,10that explaines it
<Phase4-> 00,02well, one of the ways

<Magical_pablez94> PartyCannon: yeah!!!
<Ninjazz> Gnight CrimsonPhoenix! Take care.
<Magical_pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix: CYA 2morrow :D
<BlueFlare> 02xBox 360 version of Final Fantasy is just a port too and needs 2 disk
*coyboy listens to fluttershys scream rip headphone :)

<junh1024-XD> lol
<Magical_pablez94> CrimsonPhoenix: 'night
<BlueFlare> 02needs*
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> Does anyone else like the show Girls Bravo?
<Ninjazz> I did.
<junh1024-XD> filna fantansy was obviously ported from PS3
<Viri> 14I like PS3, but just because I've never owned a Microsoft console x3
<Phase4-> 00,02yes, 1000 is low
<PartyCannon> It's used for home mains
*fillyfillyy|mezmoriz thinks that looks tasty
<Magical_pablez94> fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: i love johnny bravo :D
<Viri> 14many newgen games look...mm..."souless" to me though
<Viri> 14it's difficult to explain
<Viri> 14I can't feel the fun
<Ninjazz> Girls Bravo is a etchi anime.
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> Magical_pablez94: Girls Bravo. Johnny Bravo was good too
<BlueFlare> 02If a game is older and not Final Fantasy, I buy it for the xBox 360. New games I always buy for the PS3
<Phase4-> 00,02fun fact: mains (just about everywhere except america) is 240 Volts RMS
<Phase4-> 00,02the peak voltage is NOT 240
<Magical_pablez94> fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: just joking btw never heard about it...:)
<VDXRetrotainment> America, Y U NO BE EQUAL!?
<Sumica> 00,10yep we use 110 and 220
<Phase4-> 00,02its 240 / sqrt(2)
<Phase4-> 00,02*

<Phase4-> 00,02*derp*
<junh1024-XD> i'm a bit on the fence when it comes to xbox vs ps3, mainly since i haven't used either much
<Viri> 14PS2 vs GC
<Viri> 14:D
<junh1024-XD> wii just sucks, platform-wise , hsan't got the cpu
<Phase4-> 00,02~340V
<BlueFlare> 02^
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> Magical_pablez94: It's VERY different. It's an anime show
<Samsa> cool
<Sumica> 00,10we also call our unit of mesure standard despight being the only ones that use them
<VDXRetrotainment> sqrt Phase?

<Ninjazz> lol
<VDXRetrotainment> Ah
<[WwqUB]JRP2234> Phase4: is it me or telstra responsable for this buffer
<junh1024-XD> but i do have a ps3 atm, mainly for ripping SACDs'
<Phase4-> 00,02its probably telstra
<Magical_pablez94> fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: i know... Ninjazz made me figure what does it talk about...:D
<BlueFlare> 02well, if a game is for the xBox 360 or PS3 I never buy it for the wii
<Phase4-> 00,02i'm watching my own stream without issue
<PartyCannon> Sumica well, to NEMA they're "standard." :)
<VDXRetrotainment> That's ONE thick cable...
<Ninjazz> Your welcome, Magical_pablez94. :)
<Viri> 14I have a Wii and half a PS3
<Phase4-> 00,02high current
<Magical_pablez94> Ninjazz: :D:D
<Phase4-> 00,02lol dat broke
<VDXRetrotainment> AOW MY EAR
<junh1024-XD> half, what?
<Ninjazz> Jelly Beans!
<Phase4-> 00,02sry bout that, these are broken recordings
<PartyCannon> dat pun
<VDXRetrotainment> XD
<Onyxia> ima go visit my sister guys cya
<junh1024-XD> also, apparently, the xbox has to use the gpu AND the cpu just to playback HD video
*Malavolent is hungwey nao.
<VDXRetrotainment> It's fine. It's just bleeding ears.
<Viri> 14x3 it's not "mine"
<junh1024-XD> oh
<Magical_pablez94> Onyxia: cya
<[WwqUB]JRP2234> we meet again dat voice
<Samsa> man i love this show
<ImOkayWithThis|Derp> Yay Jellybeans
<Sumica> 00,10learn to auto balence
<Ninjazz> CYa Onyxia. Take care.
<Onyxia> thx
<BlueFlare> 02my PS3 isn't mine as well :s
<Ninjazz> Sumica... Teach how to auto balence.
*Magical_pablez94 uses magic to heal VDXRetrotainment 's ear
<Ninjazz> :P
<[WwqUB]JRP2234> Phase4: are these ur own recordings
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> Magical_pablez94: I don't think I could explain it without having to type a lot. I dont like typing a lot.
<VDXRetrotainment> <---- Sumica : I*m a person who wants 100% Control
<BlueFlare> 02I need to buy my own PS3
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<Phase4-> 00,02[WwqUB]JRP2234, no
<VDXRetrotainment> Magical_pablez94: SCIENCE!
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> I'm lazy
<Magical_pablez94> fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: lol
<Magical_pablez94> VDXRetrotainment: ???
<PartyCannon> ALL the starch!
<Viri> 14I just made an account there xD
<VDXRetrotainment> MASS PRODUCTION = The ruin of Mankind..
<BlueFlare> 02I mostly only use the wii for Mario and Zelda titles
<Malavolent> Oh my god.
<Midnight_Tempest> well... sleep time, too much Diablo 3 for one day...
<Phase4-> 00,02VDXRetrotainment, i disagree
<Sumica> 00,10well at least yours only has a moment of buffer between videos Phase4
<VDXRetrotainment> Phase4: Mass Production = more machines, less humans, more conflicts.
<Viri> 14I mostly used mine for GC games, Metroid, Fire Emblem and Pokémon
<Midnight_Tempest> less humans = less conflicts imo...
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> Midnight_Tempest: Is Diablo3 worth me buying?
<PartyCannon> Less room for hman error
<Phase4-> 00,02VDXRetrotainment, as oposed to pre mass production, where you needed to fight each other for resources
<BlueFlare> 02I use mine for GC titles as well
<Ninjazz> More machines = more precision.
<VDXRetrotainment> Better fight with money, then fight with nothing.
<PartyCannon> *human
<Midnight_Tempest> fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: if your a fan of the series, yes... if you like dungeon crawling, hack and slash games... yes..
<Magical_pablez94> fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: Ninjazz just said me it's an ecchi anime :)
<Midnight_Tempest> fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: if your not a fan of either of those, then no... its not
<Ninjazz> Yes... Yes it is.
<BlueFlare> 02which are mostly Zelda and Mario titles XD
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> Midnight_Tempest: What if I have not played any of the series but like that kind of game.
<Malavolent> So it's made of sugar... and sugar.
<Tassadork> don't forget the sugar and the sugar
<Viri> 14x3
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> Malavolent: exactly
<VDXRetrotainment> Phase4: It's not all bad though, we evolve and get better Technology from Mass Productions, but we lose out on Humans values...
<Viri> 14I have the first CoD
<Magical_pablez94> fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: u should look for diablo1..
<Malavolent> And syrup.
<Viri> 14buggy as hell, but fun
<Midnight_Tempest> fillyfillyy|mezmoriz: then it could still be worth buying, i enjoy the game alot and the idea of friends joining your game is cool
<Samsa> i love learning how the things i love are made
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> Midnight_Tempest: Cool thanks
<Fex> are those m&m's?
<BlueFlare> 02never played CoD before
<Samsa> jelly beans
<BlueFlare> 02just never got around to playing them :x
<Midnight_Tempest> but yeah... sleep time is now...
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> And rot your teeth!
<DeathStar> mmm wax
<Phase4-> 00,02VDXRetrotainment, i don't belive that tech == loss of human values. all technology is nothing more than a tool, misuse of the tools is what makes us loose values
<Viri> 14play CoD 4 :D I loved it
<Phase4-> 00,02not the tools themselves
<PartyCannon> ^
<VDXRetrotainment> Phase4: Can't disagree on that. It's too true. :(
<Magical_pablez94> Phase4: i agree
<Malavolent> ^^
<Pegasi_Prince_Shane> Phase4: iz u be streaming?
*Phase4- 00,02has very strong opinions about this
<VDXRetrotainment> Phase4: Same.
<Phase4-> 00,02iz be me
<Ninjazz> Indeed, Phase4.
<Phase4-> 00,02i've got stuff to do for now
*Phase4- 00,02might return to streaming if no one else streams
<Magical_pablez94> Phase4: so u stop streaming :(
<Magical_pablez94> ?
<PartyCannon> Thanks for the stream Phase4 :)
<BlueFlare> 02hurr
<BlueFlare> 02I'll probably buy it then XD
<VDXRetrotainment> Ghosties can't. Shiz is gone, Saturn been afk, SuperBrony64 is not saying anything, Tom is 100% afk, Wrek is.....<.<
<Samsa> thx for streaming
<Phase4-> 00,02one more video
<VDXRetrotainment> LAWl
<VDXRetrotainment> LEVAN POLKA!
<Samsa> lol
<Ninjazz> NOOOOOOOO!
<VDXRetrotainment> Is this the original? :D
*PartyCannon spins a leek
<Ninjazz> :D
<Phase4-> 00,02VDXRetrotainment, afaik
*Magical_pablez94 spins aleek
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> What is this!
<VDXRetrotainment> The ONE video that started the world meme... HAH!
<fillyfillyy|mezmoriz> MEZMORIZING!
<Malavolent> I'm okay with this.

<Malavolent> Phase4: Need more ponies.
<Ninjazz> tl;dr
<Tassadork> for a course?
<PartyCannon> Only critical flaw with that game
<Ninjazz> :D
<PartyCannon> Notch wants to charge for multiplayer
<Tassadork> oh wait no that's the notch game
<VDXRetrotainment> It looks interesting Phase4 .
*Magical_pablez94 dances ( DeathStar wanna join? :D)
<VDXRetrotainment> But...it's too hard for me to read off yet. ><
<Phase4-> 00,02VDXRetrotainment, it is
<fillyfillyy|trance> Magical_pablez94: may I dance
<VDXRetrotainment> I don't know below Assembly Code.
*DeathStar dances with Magical_pablez94
<Phase4-> 00,02stack access seems to be implimented via a register read/write
<Magical_pablez94> fillyfillyy|trance: too late lol
<Phase4-> 00,02most architectures use push/pop instructions
<Phase4-> 00,02its quite interesting
<[WwqUB]JRP2234> Phase4: i gave my wii a stack overflow
<VDXRetrotainment> Aaand 1% of us understood that XD
<DeathStar> fillyfillyy|trance: you can dance whenever you like!

<fillyfillyy|trance> Phase4: Now I must figure out what the hell all of that means! TO THE INTRANATS!
<VDXRetrotainment> PartyCannon: I kinda know C++.... :P
<Magical_pablez94> PartyCannon: m too :P

<VDXRetrotainment> fillyfillyy|trance: Give it a few years. :)
<PartyCannon> VDXRetrotainment hear hear :)
<Dj> hello?
<Magical_pablez94> DeathStar: what r u doing right now?
<VDXRetrotainment> Hello DJ
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> night DeathStar
<Magical_pablez94> hi there Dj
<Sumica> 00,10Seems Fim is moving back to 7am pst
<fillyfillyy|trance> VDXRetrotainment: This summer I am planning to learn about programming and stuff. I have no idea what that was and I don't know if it even has anything to do with programming.
<Dj> hi guys
<PartyCannon> Sumica :(
<Ninjazz> Hello Df
<Twi_Fi> Hello Dj.
<Ninjazz> Dj*
<VDXRetrotainment> Need any simple basics, ask me or Phase. :P
<VDXRetrotainment> You know about if,else, for, while etc etc?
<Ghosties> 04Do what?
<Ghosties> 047 AM PST?
<Sumica> 00,10starting next saterday
<Dj> :P
<VDXRetrotainment> O.o
<Sumica> 00,10it's still just reruns but yeah
<Magical_pablez94> VDXRetrotainment: maybe dunnos what is a function neither...
<Ghosties> 04Ohhhhhh, okay
<Sumica> 00,10Aquabats will still be at 8am pst
<VDXRetrotainment> Magical_pablez94: Functions are scripts, basically, that you can call whenever you need them to do something complicated.
<PartyCannon> VDXRetrotainment what is your opinion on for-ever loops like for(;;) with an if and a break?
<VDXRetrotainment> ...
<VDXRetrotainment> Never have a forever loop
<VDXRetrotainment> :P
<Tassadork> sometimes you need them =P. just make sure your condition fires at some point
<PartyCannon> VDXRetrotainment I can never understand why people tech it
<PartyCannon> *teach
<Dj> is anything on now?
<VDXRetrotainment> For loops are awesome for mathematical solutions
<PartyCannon> Tassadork why not just a while loop though?
<Magical_pablez94> VDXRetrotainment: i know he dunnos..
<VDXRetrotainment> While loops...oh sh't...
<Tassadork> bahdunno!
<VDXRetrotainment> NEVER use a while loop unless you understand them completely...
<VDXRetrotainment> I still don't use them
<VDXRetrotainment> They almost overburnt my computer twice. ><
<Tassadork> lol
<Dj> loops are surprisingly loopy
<Dj> :)
<Dj> *squee*
<VDXRetrotainment> http://www.mycplus.com/tutorials/c-programming-tutorials/loops/ <--- Loops(If else for while)
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> if i had a theme song this song would be it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KFkP9IvLCk&feature=related
<Tassadork> yay fellow brony coders :$
<Magical_pablez94> VDXRetrotainment: XD i use activities managment to avoid my computer to overburn :D btw using a for loop is da same..:D
<VDXRetrotainment> Basically, remember that it's binary. once you get that, Programming is easy, you just ned to know what the computer may and may not do.^^
<VDXRetrotainment> No
<VDXRetrotainment> A foor loop has a end.
<VDXRetrotainment> A for loop can loop as many times as it's operator tells it to
<Tassadork> not if you do it wrong... =)
<Magical_pablez94> VDXRetrotainment: basically a while should have a end to avoid ur pc to overburn:D
<VDXRetrotainment> Well yeah.. of course if you do wrong. :P
<VDXRetrotainment> Magical_pablez94: It does not.
<Malavolent> I've personally never had problem with loops.
<VDXRetrotainment> Most likely it can crash
<Tassadork> for (i = 0, i > 0, i++)
<VDXRetrotainment> A while loop is like hitching a battery - pool with it's battery + pool...
<Magical_pablez94> Tassadork: not, but ;
<Tassadork> ah yeah
<Phase4-> 00,02VDXRetrotainment, "NEVER use a while loop unless you understand them completely..." o_O
<Tassadork> and also should be >= now that I lok=ok at it
<Phase4-> 00,02one too many infinite loop bugs?
<VDXRetrotainment> Aye
<VDXRetrotainment> I'm trying to avoid them as much as possible
<VDXRetrotainment> I never got the hang of them. ><
<PartyCannon> I've never had an issue with while loops
<Phase4-> 00,02Tassadork, that loop will break
<Phase4-> 00,02you probably want <
<VDXRetrotainment> Yep
<VDXRetrotainment> XD
<VDXRetrotainment> Phase4: Weren't you busy with something? XD
<Magical_pablez94> VDXRetrotainment: never got problems with do/while, while and for loops :D
<Tassadork> yeah, I was posting a broken one ...
<Phase4-> 00,02and something other than 0
<Phase4-> 00,02ah
<VDXRetrotainment> Let us noobs try and figure this out XD
<Dj> chell learned about infinite loops the hard way
<PartyCannon> lol
<Tassadork> if anything while loops are simpler than for loops, there's just the condition, where with fors you have three chunks in specific order
<VDXRetrotainment> for(thisvariable = 0 thisvariable > 5 thisvariable++(or thisvariable+=1))
<Magical_pablez94> that freezed stream :D
<P0N-3> Hi, everypony!
<Magical_pablez94> pony_2521: hi there
<PartyCannon> hello P0N-3 :)
<VDXRetrotainment> Remember that the i is a local too. :P
<Dj> hi
<VDXRetrotainment> Like saying...
<VDXRetrotainment> Do your homework could be like..
<Dj> hur hur
<Phase4-> 00,02C99 ads probably the best feature ever, for(int i = 0; i < len; i++) << loop local itterator!
<Dj> :P
<Hogia> 12I'm not here to rant today.
<fillyfillyy|trance> I have no idea what you all are talking about!!!!! *head explodes*
<P0N-3> How are y'all doing tonight? It's real early Monday morning, and I'm drunk! I n other words, the usual.
<Hogia> 12I'm just bored.
<Magical_pablez94> PON-3 wht da hell? i tab failed but was not able to tab him :(
<junh1024-XD> that's right,
<Phase4-> 00,02P0N-3, reading
<VDXRetrotainment> for(Homework = 0 Homework > 12 Homework ++) <-- XD
<junh1024-XD> you are here to FLAHS!
<Phase4-> 00,02talking about programing
*junh1024-XD runs'
<P0N-3> Sunday, sunday morning.
<Tassadork> monday morning, I hope not
<P0N-3> Tab failed what?
<Magical_pablez94> oh fuck is a damned 0
<Dj> same
<PartyCannon> Phase4- y u declare int in for loop?
<Hogia> 12note the lack of |Animation as a suffix in my nick.
<VDXRetrotainment> Integer.
<Magical_pablez94> P0N-3: u trolled me wiht dat fucking 0 in ur name :D
<Phase4-> 00,02PartyCannon, so i dont have to declare it outside
<VDXRetrotainment> Oh. :P
<Phase4-> 00,02and keep track of the
<junh1024-XD> ┐(￣ー￣)┌
<P0N-3> Hee hee heehee.
<junh1024-XD> '
<Phase4-> 00,02them;
<fillyfillyy|trance> Phase4: I know that but I don't know anything about programming so I'm lost.
<Phase4-> 00,02loop local itterators are much better
<Hogia> 12so, how's NZ treating you?
<junh1024-XD> ┐(￣ー￣)┌
<VDXRetrotainment> Well fillyfillyy|trance, A good start is to learn the more basic of the values then the loops.
<junh1024-XD> (i actually wrote that on a survey on friday)
<VDXRetrotainment> Lik what is a int, i, Variable, Boolean etc etc
*junh1024-XD walks
<P0N-3> Hooray for cheap booze and easy mares!
<Magical_pablez94> VDXRetrotainment: indeed
<P0N-3> ... Which is what I MIGHT say, if I liked mares...
<Dj> doesnt mean we cant talk bout loops and ponies eh? the maths wont make our heads explode eh?
<P0N-3> But I... I'm P0N-3. Don't judge me!
<fillyfillyy|trance> Well I am going to try and learn some programming stuff this summer.
<Phase4-> 00,02P0N-3, seems legit
<VDXRetrotainment> Once you understand how the data formet works, you can build on that to the loops and decisions.
<Magical_pablez94> P0N-3: i'm confused
<Dj> Hooray!:)
<VDXRetrotainment> Like a boolean = It can either be true or false(And null, but we do NOT want that)
<Phase4-> 00,02aparentyl i'm marked as away
<PartyCannon> for(;;){ printf("PONIES");}
<Phase4-> 00,02why am i marked away
<P0N-3> Sooo what do you all think of John doing the Bronycon documentary?
<Phase4-> 00,02PartyCannon, PONIESPONIESPONIES
<P0N-3> Donations have exceeded 80,000 bits!
<VDXRetrotainment> An variable is something you can name yourself. like "iGotThisItem"
<Tassadork> while(true) ---> http://ponyfac.es/75
<VDXRetrotainment> LAWL Tassadork XD
<Memme> Am I the only brony who doesn't like Fluttershy!?
<Dj> lol just popped the chat out

<Dj> YES!:( Fluttershy is AWESOME! :(
<Hogia> 12lol
<Memme> Why!?
<P0N-3> Fluttershy is very moe.
<Memme> In what way!?
<Phase4-> 00,02fun language to try: VHDL
<junh1024-XD> if you want a more specific answer, please ask a more specific questione!
<P0N-3> And also awesome, when necessary.
<Ninjazz> Don't worry, Memme. I don't like her that much.

<Memme> Anyone here got Gmod?
<P0N-3> I like that in a pony. Adequate most of the time, but can step up to awesome. You know, when it's really needed.
<Memme> Twilight Sparkle is best pony.

<Ninjazz> Ow!
<Ninjazz> What was that for?
*Magical_pablez94 seen dat we r 104 in da chat i say: for(i=0;i<104;i++){printf("bronies\n");}
<PartyCannon> Memme that's a funny way to say Pinkie Pie!
<Phase4-> 00,02PartyCannon, no, he got it right
<ImOkayWithThis|Derp> Ninjazz: why didn't you catch it?
<Phase4-> 00,02:P
<Ninjazz> Twilight Sparkle is best pony. But my favorite is Rarity. All hail Rarity. ;)
