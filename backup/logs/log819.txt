<cachi01> WAIT
<Serenity> What the "L" is that supposed to mean
<Kammerjunk> Luigi.
<Kammerjunk> Supposedly.
<Serenity> "2041"
<Kammerjunk> How many coins in the game.

<Serenity> Yeah, I know about luigi
<cachi01> _ _ _ _ _ e - b o _ _ - i _ - _ p a n _ e _
<cachi01> Serenity: its 2401
<Phase4> the 2 looks like a 3 to me
<cowvarkian> L
<Phase4> Kammerjunk, is that actually how many coins are in the game?
<Serenity> Luigi was origially going to be a playable character, but he was scrapped for memory reasons
<Kammerjunk> Phase4: I have absolutely no clue, but probably not.
<kidzrul732> cya bronies! I'm going to check out the santa tracker right now

*Saturn 08,01just made that up
<Neotyguy40> I'm using Pidgin. I see no icons
<Stormy> although that part is true
<Stormy> not on IRC
<Stormy> on the forums
<Neotyguy40> I never noticed

<Neotyguy40> Holy crap
<Jmo> What's red and white, loves speaking in a strange language, is a silly person and contributes to the team?
<Neotyguy40> THIS IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT
<Stormy> now I suddenly wonder if I'm the only one who knows about those
<Stormy> Because I was there when they were installed, so obviously I know about them
<Neotyguy40> All forums seem to be designed in 1998
<Stormy> But maybe everyone else misses them
<Saturn> 08,01hey, no fair
<Saturn> 08,01solve my one first
<Neotyguy40> There should be a simpler forum
<BaconMane> 0,5Okay here's what I thought of.

<BaconMane> 0,5They start and end wars, whether you like it or not.
<Gekoncze> oh, that means gender :D

<Neotyguy40> I sort of talked to him before
<bunnyfufu299> G-gat-Gatorate?
<Neotyguy40> I didn't realize he was even banned
<Stormy> He seemed alright for a while
<bunnyfufu299> Idk how to spell it
<Meth> cool

<Neotyguy40> He makes good music actually
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> paintball gun
<Stormy> then he got banned for making a hate thread about Aicebo or something
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> fencing
<Stormy> and comes here every now and then to ask for "forgiveness"
<RaveBrony> Hmm
<Neotyguy40> Here's a song he showed me
<bunnyfufu299> Nice fire?
<Neotyguy40> http://www.furaffinity.net/view/8069160/
<Stormy> And when we forgive him but don't unban him, he gets angry
<Stormy> >furaffinity

<Neotyguy40> No
<Neotyguy40> It's a good song
<CrystalPhoenix> I wonder what would happen to a mod if that mod stream Bayonetta?
<Neotyguy40> Seriously
<BaconMane> 0,5here it is again.
<BaconMane> 0,5What can be used as weapons, but also soothe the distraught?
<BaconMane> 0,5They start and end wars, whether you like it or not.

<Ninjazz> I'm guessing it's not their reproductive vajayjays either.
<bunnyfufu299> Hate Gak!!!!
<BaconMane> 0,5The answer is Words
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> words
<Stormy> Ayumi made that?
<cachi01> UR MOMMA
<Stormy> wow
<RaveBrony> Oh god :D
<Stormy> that is pretty good
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> is it words?
<Neotyguy40> Yea, I know, right?
<thelonecubone> :D wow
<Ninjazz> Like Words of Power?
<bunnyfufu299> One time, when I was little, I ate Gak.
<Stormy> sounds like it could actually be in a game
<cachi01> FUS RO DAH
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> words of emotion
<BaconMane> 0,5Words can be hurtful, and they can be soothing.
<Neotyguy40> That's what I told him
<bunnyfufu299> and had to go to the hospital
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> one time when i was little..
<CCharmanderK> kaG kaG kaG
<BaconMane> 0,5Words are what start conflicts, and usually there is some speech or gathering after a war.
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> i put gooze in my underwear o.O
<RaveBrony> You dont get kicked anymore for saying g/\k?
<bunnyfufu299> Thus, I will never buy my children Gak
<Neotyguy40> Here's another
<Neotyguy40> https://soundcloud.com/arcdreams/biohazard
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> or was itthe forbidden g word
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> one of them..
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> was gooey
<CCharmanderK> I just got bumped for saying kaG. The hell?!
<thelonecubone> RaveBrony: I believe they took out the kick script
<CCharmanderK> :P
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> brother got in trouble
<bunnyfufu299> Sorry
<bunnyfufu299> :3
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> cause little me had to put it in my panties for some reason..
<Stormy> "Follow NeoSYN, Alicia Keys, The New Yorker and others on SoundCloud."
<Stormy> lol
<RaveBrony> BaconMane: You gotta admit tho, Ninjazz, had a good guess :D
<Stormy> totally related
<CCharmanderK> Stop that, BaconMane!!
<Neotyguy40> Lol
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<thelonecubone> lel

<Saturn> 08,01maybe i only said it in my head
<BaconMane> 0,5Words
<BaconMane> 0,5Wooords
<BaconMane> 0,5Wuuoorolooords
*Stormy goes through the ban list to find all of Ayumi's various names
<texasboykc09> hello everypony
<CCharmanderK> Gurk Gurk Gurk?
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> food ready
<Neotyguy40> lol
<CCharmanderK> It's Gak, but derpy. :P
<bunnyfufu299> May I say a little critique about the Season 3 premere
<CCharmanderK> Damn it, BaconMane!!!
<RaveBrony> Women can be used as weapons, they soothe the distraught, and they start and end wars (or arguements) whether you like it or not.
<Ninjazz> I wonder if someone can get the hammer for saying it enough times.
<CCharmanderK> You're having fun with this, aren't you?
<Meth> Is the ban list that large?
<Stormy> Let's see
<BaconMane> 0,5Yus
<Stormy> Ayumi_the_dark_wolf
<texasboykc09> ^
<CCharmanderK> :I
<Ninjazz> RaveBrony, good logic wasn't it?
<Neotyguy40> What if
<RaveBrony> Ninjazz: It was :D
<Ninjazz> Plus that whole Troy thing kinda supported it.
<Stormy> Rave
<Neotyguy40> Ayumi is on the forums under a hidden name
<RaveBrony> I dont know why, but im still chuckling over it, haha
<Neotyguy40> And we don't even know it
<Ninjazz> c:
<Stormy> Ayumi_the_demon_wolf
<Stormy> It's probably Clock-la
<Stormy> :P
<Neotyguy40> Oh my god
<Neotyguy40> That
<Gekoncze> o_ O
<Neotyguy40> Would make total sense
<Stormy> Ayumi_the_ethereal_wolf
<bunnyfufu299> I think King Sombra was disapointing, because I didn't get much character out of him
<Neotyguy40> I think Ayumi was banned shortly after I joined
<Neotyguy40> What was the original ban for?
<Stormy> TranceAddict86
<texasboykc09> ^
<RaveBrony> Bad design, and no screentime = Bad combo
<CCharmanderK> Yeah, the season three premiere was disappointing overall.
<CrystalPhoenix> bunnyfufu299, as what everyone else thinks
<Stormy> I think it was because he and Aicebo got in an argument
<CrystalPhoenix> Sombra was fine for what he was meant to be
<Stormy> and he made a thread about how much he hated her
<Neotyguy40> Must have been a heated argument
<bunnyfufu299> They had two full episodes to give him a little umph, but they didn't
<CCharmanderK> There seemed to be an emotional disconnect between the characters and the conflict.
<Ninjazz> I liked his design. Execution was terrible.
<texasboykc09> ^
<CCharmanderK> Nothing in the season three premiere really gelled.
<CrystalPhoenix> it's like people were expecting another Discord or something
<Stormy> DarkstylePro11
<Stormy> I don't really remember
<CrystalPhoenix> he was just pure evil
<Stormy> But the thread was pretty bad I think
<bunnyfufu299> Also, his lines were terrible
<Stormy> and SR was just sick of the guy anyways probably :P
<CCharmanderK> CrystalPhoenix: We had three awesome major villains (Nightmare Moon, Discord and Chrysalis) in a row. Sombra felt like a step down.
<Ninjazz> It's like they couldn't decide whether or not they wanted an evil prescense or someone who was great at dark magic.
<Stormy> oh here's the best Ayumi name ever
<bunnyfufu299> "My slaves." and "MMMM Crystal" *slurp*
<CrystalPhoenix> CCharmanderK, he was like Sauron
<CrystalPhoenix> pretty much
<Stormy> DZX x ViiruZz
<thelonecubone|Halo3> bunnyfufu299: at least he Went One man army stylle
<Neotyguy40> Dafuq
<thelonecubone|Halo3> style*
<CCharmanderK> That "Mmmm, Crystal" line was accompanied by an awesome "BUENO" face.
<Stormy> And
<MadSurge> ^ :D
<bunnyfufu299> I liked the other villians because of their personality and screentime
<thelonecubone|Halo3> CCharmanderK: funny becuase his name is Sombra which is spanish for shadow
<Stormy> DaRKNeZz_GlitcherZ
<Gekoncze> http://i1198.photobucket.com/albums/aa454/VampireAmaya1/Private/dafuq.jpg
<Meth> lol
<BaconMane> 0,5That's enough riddles today :P
<Stormy> I think that was the most recent one
<Ninjazz> Good one, btw.
<BaconMane> 0,5Have a nice Christmas
<Neotyguy40> When was that?
<Ninjazz> Likewise.
<Stormy> a few months ago I think

<Stormy> the thread is somewhere in trash
<Neotyguy40> hmm
<BaconMane> 0,5No, I wanna play some black ops 2 and then shower and go to the party
<Neotyguy40> Is anyone experienced with multithreading programming?
<Stormy> http://www.spyroforum.com/topic-12742-___.html

<texasboykc09> Lil_B, advent calender?
<Neotyguy40> So you're, what, 65?
<Stormy> not sure if troll?
<Kimori> and what dragon would are you speaking of
<Kimori> world*
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> i watched some tv also
<Neotyguy40> You're too old to be having 22 babies
*Stormy is gonna go with troll
<Lil_B> cheap advent calender choklate is probably the worst klind of schopcklate there is
<Stormy> don't feed the trolls guys
<Stormy> :P
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> no... cheap easter bunny chocolate
<Neotyguy40> I'll feed
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> and sport ball chocolate
<Gekoncze> 6 is this purple?
<spyrofan001> 6I started when i was 15 in the dragon realms
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> nasty stuff
<spyrofan001> 6and yes
<Diamond_Tiara_2012> choclate rain
<Lil_B> texasboykc09 tradition in germany, a calender that starts on the first of december and ends on the 24th, every day there is a very small , or a Part of one big present behind the door, and you gotto open one each day
<Neotyguy40> I'll feed it, and nurture it, and take care of it, and then kill it, and then bury it, and then grow flowers on it, and then pick the flowers, and then put them in a vase, and then fill the vase with water, and then I have a nice decoration.
<Kimori> So I guess most here already opened up gifts?
<Lil_B> texasboykc09 usually it's a small piece of schocklate, but when you make one yourself it can be anything

<Malavolent> Lil_B: Download the full version? :P
<jamajka000> Hi Everypony /)
<Malavolent> Saturn: Earning money from the songs you compose?
<Zeus> hey jamajka000
<Saturn> 08,01Malavolent: surely not; we're a community based around illegally streaming copyrighted content...
<Saturn> 08,01Malavolent: nope
<Saturn> 08,01just once i start earning money at all
<thelonecubone> Hi jamajka000
<Saturn> 08,01but that probably won't be for another 3 or 4 years
<Malavolent> Saturn: Why not?
<Lil_B> Saturn well that is an option... pirate now and pay them when you start earning enough money... I'll think about that :P
<Saturn> 08,01Malavolent: postgraduate studies and phd
<EspyLacopa> 15 minutes to animaniacs marathon
<Sabershy> Saturn: trt hatgam will not disappoint you. maybe we canplay with each other every oncen awhile.

<Saturn> 08,01adobe illustrator, indesign, and photoshop are on there
<Saturn> 08,01thouhg maybe not photoshop, actyually
<pyrocatboy> What going on?
<Lil_B> Malavolent evething after I get my new PC, which I will finally order within the next 2 Days... but I really wanna talk with someone before that who knows which components fit well together >.<
<Saturn> 08,01because i don't really use it
<jamajka000> Saturn i have list for games to buy when i have some money :D
<Saturn> 08,01i tend to just use GIMP for everything
<Snow> Scout thinks medic is a dispenser
<Ponies47> Anybody up for a little Christmas MVM?
<Sabershy> VM?
<Lil_B> I'm not a Noob in the teamr s of PC Components, buit I have never build one myself >.<
<kidzrul732> bye bronies I'm going to my grandma's house for dinner
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Congrats, I have yet 900 euros to save until I buy a new pc.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Bye kidzrul732 :)
<Saturn> 08,01i don't intend on buying a new computer for at least 5 years
<jamajka000> I build my computer and it didn't failed for about 4 or 5 years now
<Lil_B> Saturn GIMP can technicly do anythinmg, but som,e things are just extremly hard to manage on there... in fact, I use 2 different Programms for the Animation, which I could do easier with GIMP alone
<Saturn> 08,01i've had this laptop for about 2 years now, and it's perfectly powerful enough
<jamajka000> And it still can run MW3 on max graphics
<cachi01> lel mw3
<Lil_B> Saturn but GIMP... it gives me a Headache anytime I try to use it!
<cachi01> graphics
<cachi01> lel
<Bronysith> jamajka000: thats not that impressive...
<Saturn> 08,01then again, i don't play games
<Saturn> 08,01my next upgrade for my laptop wil probably be an SSD
<Saturn> 08,01because that's the main bottleneck in modern computing
<Bronysith> jamajka000: come back to me when your computer can play crysis on highest settings and run it at 60 FPS
<jamajka000> Bronysith bur doing that with Assasins Creed 3 is? Because it also work
<pyrocatboy> Anypony streaming?
<jamajka000> but*
<thelonecubone> nope
<Bronysith> jamajka000: you have to do it with Crysis to test your computers capabilities
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: my computer runs linux, so it's superior to yours anyway :P
<Bronysith> it IS the test right ShizuKlaus ?
<cachi01> Saturn: lel
<Bronysith> Saturn: sounds good, how is linux anyways?
<jamajka000> Saturn i have Linux on my old laptop
<Lil_B> well, my current PC if from 2008 , it was avereage at the time, and I now want to be both productive, and want to play games that take a few more rescources, so I gotta pay a lot, but at least uit will be enough for the next 5-7 years hopefully
<Bronysith> what is linux good for? mostly business shit?
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: it's amazing, and i'm convinced that it's going to be the next big pc gaming platform
<jamajka000> And programing
<Malavolent> Bronysith: Linux and business? I don't think so.
<Snow> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwxTCzmThls
<Lil_B> yeah xD I wanna make my PC Windows-Linux Dual-Boot
<cachi01> far over the misty mountains rise,
<Saturn> 08,01i use linux as my main OS on my laptop (which is my main computeR)
<jamajka000> My computer don't need to be powerfull because i don't use it much for games. I have PS3 and XBOX
<Saturn> 08,01i very rarely have to boot into windows or mac os, which i also have installed on it
<Malavolent> Saturn: You use it as a desktop replacement?
<Saturn> 08,01Malavolent: yup
<Saturn> 08,01it's a dual core i5 430m with a GT330m graphics card and 8gb of ram
<Malavolent> Saturn: I realized I could use one as well, that's why I'm saving up for a notebook.
<cachi01> jamajka000: same here. but im dying for a pc
<Lil_B> Saturn seeing the latest trends in the Hardware and Software Market, yeah, Gabe Newell made a good decition to make Steam Linux-Compatible
<Bronysith> my computer can play Crysis at 60 FPS on full graphics settings and half life 2 at the same time...yet playing planetside 2 or guild wars 2 makes my computer chug? what the fuck
<jamajka000> cachi so do i
<Bronysith> i guess you cant really judge it from MMOs
<Bronysith> T~T
<jamajka000> Bronysith Crysis 1 or 2?
<thelonecubone> cachi01: at least you're getting one soon, i envy you ;3;
<Bronysith> jamajka000: both
<jamajka000> Im gonna download and check it on mine'
<Bronysith> they're not even that good games, just a graphics check
<Bronysith> seeing how powerful your gaming pc is
<Bronysith> which i think is bullshit T~T
<jamajka000> Im buying new PC after New Year
<Bronysith> jamajka000: get it custom built
<jamajka000> No sh*t
<pyrocatboy> One of the few rap songs I like. This is Rivers of Blood by The Wu-Tang Clan from the The Man With the Iron Fist soundtrack http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAVQ2zycawo

<cachi01> Bronysith: quick question: you bought a a brand pc or a custom built?
<Bronysith> cachi01: custom silly
<Bronysith> of course
<jamajka000> Bronystih im from Poland so i don't pay in $ :D
<Malavolent> You would buy brand pc in 2012?
<cachi01> Bronysith: oh. cause if i get a custom built apparently its price is higher >.<
<Bronysith> HAHAHA
<pyrocatboy> yes
<Bronysith> cachi01: yea, but custom built is the way to go for gaming
<cachi01> i knooow
<Lil_B> jamajka000 hello neighbor, greeting from germany :)

<jamajka000> Hi
<cachi01> no lag at all
<Bronysith> cachi01: yea, like waht though? MMOs?

<pyrocatboy> So what do you guys like the song I linked?
<axadentel> Hello
<MLP_Brovakiin> Lil_B: You and many others :p
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai axadentel :)
<Bronysith> cachi01: not to mention they are great games
<cachi01> Bronysith: k. though i already have them on ps3 and xbox lel
<Malavolent> Lil_B: And?
<Lil_B> the look of a PC is something I completly Ignore, I want a Cheap case that stirdy and let's the Air through nicly
<jamajka000> I'm buying Core I5 3330 processor, Asus P8B75-V motherboard, Saphire Radeon HD7850 2048 DDR5 256 bit graphic card, And 16 gb 1333mhz ram
<Bronysith> cachi01: well PC version of new vegas is surperior to the console releases, the fallout 3 is pretty much the same though
<axadentel> So. When will the streaming continue?
<Bronysith> it is streaming right now
<Bronysith> ALL HAIL THE LOG
<Zeus> ugh, opened up presents early and as a joke my family got me a MLP toy set...
<axadentel> Besides the pretty fire
<Bronysith> Zeus: ...
<Bronysith> Zeus: wrong generation?
<Lil_B> Malavolent and my parents think I'm addicted to my PC because I'm not with other people at some Partys on Christmas and New Years Eve :/
<MadSurge> Zeus: how is that a joke? Old Gens? :D
<pyrocatboy> Bronysith Do you think there are types of games that wouldn't port well to a computer?
<Serenity> Zeus: Don't be mad
<Zeus> no it was really akward though
<Bronysith> pyrocatboy: dark souls T~T
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Why would you go there if you don't want to?
<Bronysith> pyrocatboy: it requires a gamepad to play right
<jamajka000> GTA IV is lame on PC
<Malavolent> Zeus: Best parents ever :D
<Zeus> I like the gift but not the context
<Serenity> pyrocatboy: Racing games tend to work better on consoles
<Serenity> Unless you have a race wheel
<Bronysith> Serenity: they only work if you have a racing wheel
<Serenity> Racing games are NOT to be played on keyboards
<pyrocatboy> Bronysith Another game I think won't do well on computers are the SSX games.
<Lil_B> pyrocatboy certain types of Adventure Games , I was thinking about it earlier and came to the conclusion that Zelda wouldn't play welöl on the PC without a Controller
<Bronysith> pyrocatboy: or fighting games...unless you have a fightstick
<jamajka000> Serenity racing games are also good on pad's
<Serenity> Bronysith: I play GP4 with a Gamecube controller
<Lil_B> Malavolent I think her point was that I don't have much/any real life friends that care about me :/
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Custom Ponies #96
<Bronysith> jamajka000: doesnt feel right though, racing games are MEANT FOR WHEELS
<Sabershy> Zeus: At least it was in god humor. I would be dead if my parents ever found out.
<Sabershy> *good
<Serenity> Same
<Serenity> My dad's an SA goon, how do you think I feel?
<pyrocatboy> Lil_B Espicialy the ones with a wheel menu. (ie: Twilight Princess)
<jamajka000> Somepony Played FAR CRY 3 i have a problem with one mission
<Malavolent> Lil_B: I could count my real life friends I can trust using just the ten fingers I have.
<Bronysith> now Twilight princess...was a great zelda game
<Zeus> Sabershy: lols when they walk in on you its really wierd, the next conversation would be very awkward
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Doesn't make me any less happy though.
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> im crying
<Zeus> Bronysith: still in the middle of my playthrough and im loving it
<jamajka000> HUG?
<Bronysith> Zeus: yea, people give it too much hate
<Serenity> After weeks of plannig
<cachi01> http://i1002.photobucket.com/albums/af150/The_FalconO6/CurrentLogicalPCBuyingGuide/Guide.png im using this guide kandarihu gave to me
<otakon> Merry Christmas all
<Bronysith> otakon !
<Sabershy> Zeus: i got a speach and everything once they find out. :D
*Bronysith christmas hugs otakon
<MLP_Brovakiin> You too otakon :)
*ouo back
<Serenity> I'm finally going to fuck around and hack the shit out of Pokemon Emerald
*Bronysith gives otakon a christmas present
<Sabershy> Bronysith: A classic game that everyone should play at least once.
<Zeus> Bronysith: the story is awesome why would people hate it?
<otakon> oh what is this?
<Lil_B> dead chat? or just stuck on my end? anyway I'm getting something to drink
<cachi01> merry xmas otakon =D
*otakon unwraps the present
<Bronysith> Sabershy: i wouldnt say twilight princess is classic
*otakon finds a tonberry
<Snow> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NCERdh_-j4 this made me sad ;-;
<Bronysith> otakon: wrong box T~T
<otakon> lol
<Bronysith> otakon: it was meant to be a Vita
<cachi01> Snow: gotta love dat sfm
<Sabershy> Certainly old enough to be... >_>
<Lil_B> Hello otakon !
<otakon> oh
<Bronysith> i think a game should be over 10 years old to be considered classic
<Serenity> 6410d? Is that Radeon?
<otakon> funny you should say that Sith
<pyrocatboy> Serenity Is it just me, or do the Elite Four always seem stronger in the third pokemon game from each generation?
<otakon> I saw a Vita in a skill machine at the mall
<Bronysith> otakon: what? T~T
<otakon> yeah
<jamajka000> It's getting bit late
<jamajka000> brb guys
<otakon> you could win a Vita for 1 dollar if you're skilled enough
<Bronysith> otakon: lols, but that cant happen
<Serenity> pyrocatboy: I dunno, I fuck them all, so I'm making them semi hard, but I'm gonna add Johto, like G/S/C had Kanto
<Bronysith> otakon: but anyways, hopefully i get it for persona 4
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npWDC_ysqUQ
<Serenity> Then the Johto crew will be hard as hell
<otakon> Bronysith: bon chance
<Lil_B> Bronysith I didn't liked Twilight Princess, and I think Benzai got my thaughts states rather well, I liked Skywars Swords though what many people hated :/ anyway, Majoras Mask is still thje best and Link's Awakening my favourite :P
<Bronysith> otakon: i really hope persona 4 is as good as everyone says
<Lil_B> need something to drink...
<Bronysith> Lil_B: of course majoras mask is best
<otakon> Bronysith: it is, the Vita port is good too
<Neotyguy40> Hey all
<Bronysith> otakon: well yea, cause the vita is just a portable playstation 3 with those dual analogs
<Bronysith> so much locked potential
<pyrocatboy> Have any of you played the Disgaea games?
<Bronysith> the poor thing needs more games T~T
<Serenity> Bronysith: Actually, it's slightly less capable of a PS3
<MadSurge> Bronysith: I heard good stuff about it! Less animu than Persona 3 too :D
<Serenity> Though VERY close
<Zeus> you know a game I cant wait for is Watch Dogs
<Gekoncze> hi
<Bronysith> Serenity: probably the best handheld system out there, so much fucking potential
<Serenity> Yep
<MadSurge> Zeus: I saw interesting things in that trailer
<Serenity> BUT. It's Sony, they'll fuck it all up.
<Zeus> MadSurge: the animation was terrific and the story looks interesting
<Bronysith> Serenity: like planetside 2?
<MadSurge> Zeus: also a trailer that consisted of GAMEPLAY? Crazytown!
<Serenity> Yep.
<Zeus> ikr
<Bronysith> otakon: also, is metal gear solid 3 on vita?
<MadSurge> Zeus: that's why I'm interested on Last of Us too, besides being made by Naughty Dog
<otakon> Bronysith: hmmm I heard mixed things
<Zeus> MadSurge: heard about that, makes me wish I had a PS3
<Bronysith> otakon: cause i still need to play metal gear solid 3
<pyrocatboy> I follow 302 blogs on tumblr.
<otakon> Bronysith: get the HD collection
<otakon> Bronysith: seriously great buy for anyone who likes the series
<Zeus> pyrocatboy: jeez
<Bronysith> otakon: i can appreciate a movie that has a deep story with great characters, hideo kojima is a genius
<Bronysith> wait, no, metal gear solid 3 isnt the movie
<otakon> Bronysith: lol
<otakon> I've never liked the MGS series too much
<Bronysith> metal gear solid 4 has like hours of cutscenes
<Zeus> MadSurge: you heard of Beyond: Two Souls?
<Bronysith> like one is actually 45 minutes long?
<Bronysith> what the fuck
<otakon> it's kind of over hyped bye MGS 4 is a very pretty looking game and plays pretty well
<MadSurge> Zeus: :O no
<otakon> Bronysith: yfw Xenosaga had 1h45 minutes of automated cut scenes... in the first 8 hours of game plya
<Zeus> MadSurge: its made by the people who made Heavy Rain, it looks awesome
<pyrocatboy> Bronysith They might as well call MGS games movies with interactive parts of the game.
<Bronysith> MadSurge: beyond, two souls? YES I WANTS IT
*aniderp|bestfruitcak needs hugs
<Bronysith> otakon: difference is, i dont want xenosage
*thelonecubone hugs aniderp|bestfruitcak
<Bronysith> already have so many RPGs to play
<otakon> Bronysith: decent game though
<MadSurge> Zeus: I think I'll pass... Heavy Rain never appealed to me :/
<twilight_sprinkl|mob> AJ's confirmed parents as dead ;_;
<otakon> yeah I have to play through L.A. Noire, Game of Thrones, Max Payne 3 and Far Cry 3 still

<cachi01> X3RainbowDashX3: u need to buy a bronystate premium account
*X3RainbowDashX3 filling out paper work
<Bronysith> otakon: garbage is too good to describe the newest final fantasies
<otakon> Bronysith: the recent ones, specifically XIII and XIII-2, ESPECIALLY XIII-2
<cachi01> just 49.99 a month
<X3RainbowDashX3> ohhh coolio
<MadSurge> Zeus: dude, it's a platform-like shooter with four dudes against an army of soldiers and improbable mechanical monsters :D
<thelonecubone> cachi01: It cost like 64& a month
<otakon> pyrocatboy: Strategy RPG
<thelonecubone> $*
<X3RainbowDashX3> thatnks cachi01 /me slaps
<thelonecubone> lel
<otakon> ugh the "canon" ending of FFXIII-2 is stupid
*X3RainbowDashX3 slaps

<Zeus> MadSurge: just got a look at it makes me wish I had a gameboy
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qycQeSltxnQ otakon this describes the new final fantasies
<otakon> eeyup
<cachi01> otakon: i still have to finish the game :I
<otakon> cachi01: don't bother
<otakon> really don't bother
*X3RainbowDashX3 lays down and wishes rainbow dash was with me
<Zeus> Final Fantasy 13 great soundtrack and battle system but it was meh
<cachi01> and really why the fuck all of the sudden is lightning dead
<cachi01> and bla blah
<cachi01> shit happens
<MadSurge> Bronysith: it's so bad to see where they sank, after playing two really nice SNES era experimental RPGs made by Squaresoft...
<otakon> cachi01: bc time skip
<Bronysith> otakon: wait, you actually finished the final fantasie 13 games?
<Lil_B> In terms of Turn based strategy RPGs like the olf FF tites... I think Mother 3 is the best RPG, well, ok it had rather boring combat and not a special leveling or pgrade Systhem so FFVI or Crono Trigger are , if you consider everything, the best
<Zeus> hm
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSoCld6kVKE
<Bronysith> chrono trigger is the God OF JRPGs
<Bronysith> and Final fantasy 6 >.>
<pyrocatboy> Disgaea=Grinding
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I thought the combat was the best part of Mother 3 because debuffers actually mattered
*X3RainbowDashX3 looks for somepony
<ouo> oh Mother!
<Lil_B> MadSurge yes, but I actually beat the game even without that :/
<Bronysith> Chrono trigger, final fantasy 6, 7, persona 3 and legend of dragoon are my fav RPGs right now
<MadSurge> Lil_B: well, in the early part they were necessary :D
<Lil_B> MadSurge I love Mother 3 for everything it had to offer, don't get me wrong there :P
<MadSurge> Lil_B: I think I already said I hated the story :| sorry if I did
<pyrocatboy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKgNMiy2p5Q&list=PL1B0FCEF532E3DC85 Animal Alpha: Bundy
<pyrocatboy> Burnout Revenge is best racing game
<Lil_B> MadSurge really? awww it was such a nice Story :)
<Bronysith> GTA 4 is best racing game
<MadSurge> :O pyrocatboy! How long has it been?
<Lil_B> MadSurge now wait, I remember your argument! yes, it was REALLY depressing
<Bronysith> Mother 3 is depressing
<pyrocatboy> MadSurge has what been?
<Bronysith> not as depressing as bioshock, or shadow of the colossus, or evangelion
<Bronysith> or super mario brothers
<Bronysith> or majoras mask
<Zeus> Bronysith: Bioshock wasnt so depressing in the end
<pyrocatboy> Bronysith wut
<Bronysith> Zeus: in the end, IN THE END
<MadSurge> Lil_B: it wasn't just that, I thought they wasted characters and some things really came out of nowhere and were pulled put of nowhere
<Bronysith> majoras mask is a depressing game yes, would you agree otakon ?
<Zeus> Bronysith: unless you were an evil turd
<MadSurge> pyrocatboy: I haven't seen you in a while
<thelonecubone> Bronysith: you chosed to kill or save the little sisters?
<Bronysith> thelonecubone: save of course

<Zeus> cachi01: its gonna be the bomb I just hope they maintain the atmosphere the other two had
<Lil_B> I just can't decide whats better, Earthbound or Mother 3, they are so similar yet so different, and so legendary good
<thelonecubone> Zeus: me as well
<Bronysith> otakon: would RDR be kind of depressing or just bittersweet?
<Saturn> 08,01everyoine

<Serenity> Actually, Phones suck, end of ^^
<Stormy> o.o
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> /sysinfo

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its unique to this irc client I think
<Neotyguy40> /say /say
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I dunno.
<Stormy> seems kind of useless
<kimplix> how are you gonna contact someone if u haven't got any coins on you or are far away?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> maybe if someone asks what your running
<Neotyguy40> So
<Stormy> Unless you want to brag about your computer to a bunch of nerds
<Neotyguy40> Like when I asked Meth what his graphics card was?
<Serenity> kimplix: No need, haven't needed it for the past 8 years
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes
<Methisbad> lol
<cachi01> uhmm if u are far away then u will have no signal
<Stormy> Yes
<Cypresswolf> :3 Drat! I cant find that bacon jingle - consider yourselves lucky, I'll remember it next year! :D
<kimplix> actuley, don't answer that
<Methisbad> yeah
<Stormy> like that
<Methisbad> or how much ram you have
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I needs more ram.
<Neotyguy40> I got 8GB
<cachi01> bacon jingle?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But impossible to upgrade.
<Methisbad> yeah -- lol
<Stormy> I probably have the least RAM of anyone here
<Stormy> 1 GB
<Stormy> beat that
<cachi01> i am the bacon man bring all the pork i can to all the little kids down the road
<Stormy> :P
<Neotyguy40> How
<kimplix> ok that's off my task, off to christmas chatting
<Neotyguy40> How do you run anything
<cachi01> clogging their arteries with all my msgs then they all die at the age of 6
<cachi01> 8
<Stormy> ancient netbook
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I like the fact I have 3 weeks of uptime
<Methisbad> lol
<Neotyguy40> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> which is rare of this laptop.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> for*
<Cypresswolf> some meat company, whos name I cant remember, has a bacon jingle that goes "Give us some crispy bacon"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> It usually crashes all the time and messes up.
<Methisbad> lol
<cachi01> lol
<cachi01|afk> brb
<kimplix> if you had a family of 4, served a large christmas dinner and there was half of scrap left, what would you go for first?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I was going to take it back if it crashed one more time, but I guess that was 3 weeks ago...
<Methisbad> lol
<kimplix> i'd say turkey
<Bronysith> is the evil dead trilogy good?
<Neotyguy40> It's like a kid playing hookie
<Neotyguy40> Pretends to be sick all the time
<Stormy> Meth can only say lol
<Stormy> Seriously though
<Methisbad> lol
<Neotyguy40> But when you say you'll bring him to the Doctor he gets out of bed and hauls himself, books and all
<Methisbad> haha
<Stormy> I'll bet over half of the messages you've sent in this channel have been "lol"
<Methisbad> you forgot
<Methisbad> :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> or something asking for dating advice.
<Neotyguy40> lol
<Stormy> that's another 25%
<Methisbad> or Spyro
<Stormy> Spyro sucks
<Methisbad> SR, i bet 1/2 of ur messages is MLP
<Neotyguy40> Or his friend's girlfriend
<Stormy> Ohhhh yeah
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone care for a joke?
<Stormy> better split that 50% "lol" in half for that
<Methisbad> lol
<Cypresswolf> This is as good a substiturte as any - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLFAXvFYhsE - Freestyle Bane ^_^
<TheGentlemanBrony> Sooo...we've been watching fire for like an hour now.
<Stormy> then then another 20% is lying about some useless crap
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> hahaha
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> 20% trying to be a big shot.
<DerpyMuffins> I'll take that as a needed yes
<Neotyguy40> And another chunk is the phrase "so..."
<Stormy> wait, some of these probably overlap
<DerpyMuffins> What's green and stands in the corner?
<Neotyguy40> No they don't Stormy
<Stormy> He tries to be a bigshot while lying about stuff
<kimplix> a tree?
<ouo> Bronysith it was awesom!
<Neotyguy40> He talks 180% of the time
<Stormy> and while talking about his friend's girlfriend
<bluemane> hello
<Neotyguy40> We have the correct percentages
<ouo> 2 part and third mostly
<Stormy> I mean the categories smartass
<Stormy> Not the percentages
<Stormy> :P
<kimplix> hi bluemane
<Neotyguy40> Ouch
<Neotyguy40> Cold words Stormy
<bluemane> hi kimplix
<Bronysith> ouo: you mean army of darkness?

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> if you pastebin them they are public.
<Methisbad> lol
<Neotyguy40> Yea, they're probably too long for pastebin
<prince-dari> You can put them unlisted
<Methisbad> one thing that SR and Stormy were talking about shouldnt be public
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> It will ruin my chances of becomming a crooked politician.
<Bronysith> otakon: are all 3 of the evil dead movies good though?
<prince-dari> Hahahaha
<MadSurge> Gotta go to bed early today, I'll go visit my relatives tomorrow and have an Xmas feast! See you tomorrow! :)

<Neotyguy40> I know I do
<Stormy> you've never said that
<Bronysith> cause its the best one?
<otakon> that was the standout one due to bigger budget
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> You should know I hate consoles
<otakon> and it was way over the top
<Stormy> and you liked the PSP
<Bronysith> so good?
<Bronysith> for B movies?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> pffft that was like 6 years ago.

<Methisbad> lol
<Stormy> you totally did
<ouo> it's perfect for B
<ouo> i think
<Methisbad> I want the new DS
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I made fun of your parents for not being able to afford to buy you a ds.
<Methisbad> lol
<Stormy> but again, it was like 6 years ago
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Just kidding of course.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so don't bite my head off.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Probably more than 6 years
<Stormy> I don't do that anymore

<SantaNoobs> I'm wearing a regular T under a Red 20% cooler hoodie
<MakerDusk> they're banned in the states because they keep on dropping planes >_<
<cachi01|afk> :D
<SantaNoobs> If you shine them in the sky directly at planes
<MakerDusk> it should have a visible beam though
<Kimori> Did I miss more spamming again >.>
<MakerDusk> so that's epic :D
<SantaNoobs> 500mW can be seen perfectly in daylight, at night, it is so bright that you have to cover your eyes
<ouo> http://www.deviantart.com/morelikethis/artists/320116524#/d5gctzy
<SantaNoobs> MakerDusk: It burns through paper

<SantaNoobs> My mom also got me A Very Minty Christmas MLP (doesn't know much about bronies), and I kindly asked her if I could shine my new laser through it. in 30 seconds, there was a big hole in the case going through one of their ugly G3 faces of death.
<Methisbad> yo
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSRp6wlgbEM

<SantaNoobs> cachi01: It is in the bin, sorry
<SantaNoobs> I don't wanna have to dig it out
<SantaNoobs> But it looks funny, just a big burnt hole through the case and through the DVD.
<SantaNoobs> I killed them with fire
<Unnr> SantaNoobs: but minty is love
<SantaNoobs> Unnr: Minty is the best of the G3 ponies (I have to admit), but still in the creation of the ugly G3 design... if she were recreated as a G4 and not as stupid, it would be awesome.
<Unnr> But.. minty...T_T
<ouo> why g3 ponies wear socks and g4 doesn't ;_;
<SantaNoobs> Everyone has different opinions.
<Serenity> Internet will die
<SantaNoobs> ouo: The makers would allow them to wear socks, because of le internets
<Serenity> I will make sure it happens!

<Saturn> 08,01i... have no idea what is going on

<Kammerjunk> Oh, there's not a kick on gak anymore?
<ShizuKlaus> 13what's this? faaaamily money

<Vordox> Sombra
<Vordox> Crystal Ponies

<Kammerjunk> All I remember from the Crystal Empire is King Sombrero.
<KrazyNoobs> Because g--... i mean, GAK, isn't as popular anymore, and there is less chance that people will spam with it now (at everytime except the new episode)
<Vordox> Heart of pwnwin

<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=4Sl_D3Wx1sQ#t=1007s
<KrazyNoobs> But really, The Crystal Empire was good, but the reason everyone says it was so bad was that they knew how awesome it could have been. They could have either gone the "entertain people" route, or the "advertise crystal pony" route.
<ouo> ponies made of diamonds
<Vordox> Here you go
<Vordox> :D
<Kammerjunk> cachi01: That may be the single best moral I have ever heard.

<Stormy> Are you sure you're really 14?
<jcelios> :$
<Stormy> and not an older kid from 4chan laughing at how gullible we are?
<DinkyDoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdyZV0PmZVw
<Stormy> I'm not ruling that out yet :p
<ouo> A pony is a small horse[1][2][3] (Equus ferus caballus). Depending on context, a pony may be a horse that is under an approximate or exact height at the withers, or a small horse with a specific conformation and temperament. There are many different breeds. Compared to other horses, ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails and overall coat, as well as proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, thicker necks, and shorter heads with broader
<Methisbad> I can prove that I'm 14

<DerpyMuffins> Fluttershy is overrated
<jcelios> Says Derpy :P
<Reikim> So.
<DerpyMuffins> Haven't you heard?
<Reikim> I see we're watching the log channel.
<DerpyMuffins> Derpy isn't in S3
<Serenity> Merry Christmas, Everypony!
<Serenity> 15 minutes late, but I don't care!
<Reikim> Needs more Christmas carols in the background.
<Reikim> Somebody play Carol of the Bells.

<DerpyMuffins> I'll get tran-siberian orchestra for ya Reikim
<Reikim> Nah, need original
<Reikim> Much as I love the TSO.
<ShizuKlaus> 13finally...
<ShizuKlaus> 13turns out it's hard to move the spawnpoint of a server without bukkit
<Serenity> ShizuKlaus: lelel
<Reikim> > Server
<jcelios> I don't care what you say Bill is best pony!
<Reikim> > No Bukkit
<Reikim> What happened
<jcelios> Bukkit is dead :(
<Reikim> What horrible happenings occurred?
<Reikim> What the hell
<Reikim> Isn't Essentials still updated for the latest version?
<ouo> jcelios but ... but i wub ponies in The Hobbit
<ouo> they warm and fuzzy c:
<jcelios> gather around and let me tell you the story of Bill
<VenHur> Hi everpony, why's the chatroom's white?
<jcelios> Bill was described as being old, weak, and sickly.
<JRP2234> i got my wii u who has teh u in wii
<VenHur> *everypony
<jcelios> During Bill's stay with The Fellowship in the city of Rivendell, it was observed that his once poor health had improved.
<ouo> http://i.imgur.com/7f7l9.png
<alexxm> how are things VenHur i don't know is it something with your client?
<jcelios> When the creature of the lake (Watcher in the Water) attacked, Bill fled in fear. Sam, who cared for him greatly and had grown attached to him, thought him to be dead, and grieved.
<VenHur> I'm not sure.
<jcelios> :'(
<jcelios> On their way home, however, they found he had returned safely to Bree. Bill played a small part in the winning of the Battle of Bywater by kicking his former master, Bill Ferny, in the backside, and thereby freeing the Shire from further entanglements from the foul man.
<jcelios> The End
<jcelios> yay!
<Methisbad> ...
<Reikim> So seriously what happened to Bukkit?
<ouo> sounds like bill was a smart pony
<ouo> why the hell they can't find actually pony for this role
<the_real_pony_1604> those ponies need a hair cut, ouo
<ShizuKlaus> 13Reikim: FTB mods require Forge, Forge can't have bukkit
<JRP2234> marry chrissy
<Reikim> Mm, hold on
<ouo> the_real_pony_1604 i like zem :3 Think mlp need more furr on ponies
<Reikim> I used to run Forge.
<ouo> also just thought
<jcelios> as I understand it Forge is going to try to replace parts of Bukkit
<Reikim> It's been a while though...can't you use Essentials with Forge?
<jcelios> or rather incorperate them into Forge
<the_real_pony_1604> aren't most of the mods in FTB the same as tekkit? because thats a bukket server
<Reikim> Also I'm fairly certain I used to have Bukkit, or parts of Bukkit, with Forge.
<jcelios> yeah they used to be seperate things
<jcelios> and were compatible
<ouo> is Twi have a razor to remove growing furr?
<jcelios> I'm not sure why the Bukkit team abadoned the project
<ouo> why some ponies are fuzzy and some are skinny
<jcelios> I heard rrumors they were working for mojang now?
<jcelios> minecraft fairly recently dropped the whole seperate code base for singlerplayer and multiplayer thing also
<jcelios> probably related
<KrazyNoobs> I am asking, was I just doing something inappropriate? I left this unlocked, and my brother could have gotten on. If I did anything, I am sorry.
<KrazyNoobs> I'll scroll up and see
<jcelios> you spammed the N-word 999999999999 times
<ouo> http://amazingnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dwarf-horse-thumbellina.jpg
<ouo> dat lyra sit
<Rex_Mundi> Whats up, BronnyState?
<Rex_Mundi> *Bronystate
<KrazyNoobs> jcelios: Dayum, sorry bout that. :( That was my brother.
<KrazyNoobs> How long ago?
<jcelios> KrazyNoobs: I was kidding actually :$
<KrazyNoobs> jcelios: Good, so my brother did nothing. :)
<jcelios> KrazyNoobs: far as I can tell nothing happened
<ShizuKlaus> 13Reikim: there's a Forge Essentials mod that imports most of the Essentials stuff (except setting server spawn) and WorldEdit(yaaaay)
<Afflict> brb
<ouo> http://horsebreedslist.com/horse_breed_images/84/big/shetland-pony-picture-6.jpg
<ouo> ponies are cute :3
<KrazyNoobs> jcelios: Good, for a second while I was going to the store, I thought my brother would have gotten on and got be banned. He didn't, so it's all good. :)
<ShizuKlaus> 13Bukkit's also basically giving the finger to devs trying to bridge compatibility between Forge and Bukkit so all the mod devs are moving to Forge and FTB
<KrazyNoobs> I watch this fire all day, everyday day
<jcelios> ouo: these things are cute to be real!
<KrazyNoobs> all day everyday
<KrazyNoobs> all day, everday
<KrazyNoobs> all day, everyday
<KrazyNoobs> etc
<KrazyNoobs> I'm going to TF2. bye for now
<ouo> bye
<VenHur> Hi ShizuKlaus, so you changed the layout of the chatroom from black to white?
<ShizuKlaus> 13wat

<jcelios> he just kissed my uncle :P
<Major> Saturn: she once made a Lemon Oreo Lemon Cake :3

<Lasharus> I can but agree, J_E_Smith71. :P
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: what? parking over the edge?
<Kammerjunk> Bronysith: Well, he didn't exactly not notice it.

<Lasharus> That's why this is genius. :P
<Bronysith> HELLLLLLLLO NURSE
<Bronysith> She has an iq of 192
<Bronysith> poor thing
<J_E_Smith71> It alwAYS IS
<mitamaking> Dissolve to the next scene quick
<Bronysith> this show has no 4th wall
<Bronysith> at all
<Presents47> So many 4th wall breakings and I love it! :D
<Bronysith> it annihlated the 4th wall
<Bronysith> Presents47: it didnt break
<MakerDusk> my stove burned out ;_;
<Bronysith> it ANNIHILATED
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: you jinxed me into getting coal for christmas
<mitamaking> Just let him eat you Road Runner
<Lasharus> Slappy is such a delightfully evil hag. :P
<Scootsy_Pie> this show broke the 5th wall
<Bronysith> Lasharus: shes not evil, just awesome
<Lasharus> The two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.
<Lasharus> Dr. Robotnik, for example, combines the traits admirably.
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/n6Vxp.jpg r...really?
<Lasharus> (and yes, I'm fanboying again)
<Bronysith> REAL:Y!?
<Bronysith> FUCKING REALLY?!
<KrazyNoobs> derpy
<mitamaking> Pebbles.... Bam Bam... implied sex.... :o
<Bronysith> Lasharus: robotnik is a terrible villain
<Lasharus> How DARE you!
<Bronysith> oh god, so much great animation
<Sumica> 00,10blew his mind
<mitamaking> nothing does.... this show is so dirty
<J_E_Smith71> Bronysith: Maybe he's talking about SatAM Robotnik
<SpeccyRush> oh lovely
<Bronysith> J_E_Smith71: ahh, you mean the only good sonic show?
<Major> XD
<Presents47> Here we go agian
<Lasharus> I'm talking about ALMOST every version, J_E_Smith71. With the exception of the AoStH version, who was frankly idiotic.
<KrazyNoobs> Babies on planes. >:(
<Lasharus> And SatAM wasn't that good. Robotnik's stellar voice acting made a difference for it though.
<J_E_Smith71> Bronysith: Yeah the one where Robotnik wasn't a goof
<Lasharus> Jim Cummings, for that version, if memory serves.
<Bronysith> Lasharus: in the 3d sonic games, he is pure annoying
<Lasharus> I disagree.
<KrazyNoobs> I hate it when, for no reason, all the babies on a plane start crying.
<Lasharus> He is fantastic in Sonic Generations, I liked his style in Sonic Adventure 1 and 2.
<Lasharus> Sonic 2006 should be shot and burned, admittedly.
<Bronysith> Lasharus: you do realize its the fans fault that game sucks right?
<Lasharus> No.
<mitamaking> I like Robotnik in Adventure and Adventure 2, they were going somewhere with the character then stopped
<Bronysith> you guys are never satisfied =_=
<Lasharus> Oh please.
<Lasharus> Have you SEEN Sonic 2006?
<mitamaking> oh
<Presents47> I've never been on a plane so I wouldn't know how to feels to be trapped on one with a crying baby.
<Major> Oh god
<Lasharus> And most of us are satisfied with Sonic Generations.
<mitamaking> :)
<J_E_Smith71> Ooooooooooh
<Bronysith> Lasharus: the game was meant to come out in the 18th anniversary, you sonic tards demanded it be released for the 15h
<Lasharus> 'you sonic tards' - thanks for that.
<Bronysith> Lasharus: therefore it was rushed
<Bronysith> Sumica: <3
<mitamaking> Why announce it if it was coming out in 4 years?
<Bronysith> Sumica: mark hamil is best joker
<Lasharus> Even if it weren't rushed, there were so many appalling design choices, it was doomed from the bloody outset.
<Bronysith> mitamaking: duke nukem forever
<Lasharus> Have you even SEEN that storyline?
<mitamaking> Bronysith: That game stunk too
<Bronysith> mitamaking: exactly
<Major> And he will magically land without a scratch
<Lasharus> Time travel insanity, a romantic subplot featuring Sonic and a HUMAN girl, of all bloody things...
<Lasharus> Rushing I'm willing to grant being the fault of the fanbase.
<Bronysith> Lasharus: arent most sonic fans furries?
<Lasharus> The horrible design choices, I will not.
<J_E_Smith71> I'm watching I's a Wonderful Life right now myself
<Lasharus> Why do I get the impression you're just trolling me now?
<Bronysith> J_E_Smith71: best christmas movie
<Bronysith> besides diehard of course J_E_Smith71
<mitamaking> Bronysith: As a My Little Pony fan I find that attitude insulting
<Lasharus> With all due respect, I dislike parts of the Sonic fanbase for being overzealous, but those kinds of generalisations are tiresome.
<mitamaking> J_E_Smith71: My dad is too
<J_E_Smith71> Normally I'd join in a Sonic discussion but I'm watching the film, only looking at chat during commericals
<Saturn> 08,01by and large, most furries are bi, and large.
<mitamaking> Sorry Batman, people are nice
<Bronysith> Saturn: o u
<Kammerjunk> What Lasharus said. I don't dislike the Sonic fandom, I just dislike the people who are overzealous about it.
<Lasharus> ...thanks, Saturn.
<Lasharus> Just... thanks.
<Lasharus> I think I'll be leaving.
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: uh... wut? that was... usefu
<Bronysith> Its a wonderful life is a great story for sure
<Sumica> 00,10pffff, wonderfull life being chearful.
<KrazyNoobs> Now when my parents ask me what I learned, I could say that furries are bi and large. Thanks, Satturn
<Kammerjunk> Tolerance for everything except intolerance is how I live.
<mitamaking> dun dun dun
<weeping_pegasi82> so have any of the streamers streamed the carol burnet show?
<Bronysith> Sumica: thats like saying eveangelion is hot blooded
<Kammerjunk> KrazyNoobs: You learn something every day.
<Bronysith> god i love the jokers smile
<weeping_pegasi82> that laugh
<KrazyNoobs> Kammerjunk: amazing, isn't it? : D
<Saturn> 08,01i hate generalisations; anyone who makes them is an idiot
<Bronysith> ^
<mitamaking> Saturn: Oh you
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: o u
<weeping_pegasi82> :D
<Lasharus> ......
<Saturn> 08,01btw, you all know that bronystate is changing its name, right?
<mitamaking> Saturn: why and what?
<Haku1013> Christmas with family is a bad time for Haku, so Haku is now going to spend time with his OTHER family.
<Saturn> 08,01from 1st January 2013, we'll be known as FurryState
<Haku1013> is Batman
<Bronysith> Saturn: yay
<SantaTheDuck> Saturn, oh you :$
<Haku1013> *ie
<mitamaking> Saturn: I hope you do
*Bronysith suplexes Haku1013 , kindly adn friendly and brotherly
<Major> Saturn: eh, I wont mind :P
<Saturn> 08,01we will be embracing the furry side of the pony fandom
<Haku1013> nyeh
<Bronysith> Saturn: yay, any yummy posts?
<KrazyNoobs> oh. please
<Major> yay~?
<Saturn> 08,01and will do our part to merge bronydom into furrydom
<KrazyNoobs> 14+?
<Bronysith> Saturn: indeed
<Ryunosuke> the furrydom?
<Major> Saturn: yes! We will end this stupid argument!
<KrazyNoobs> The furries have a fandom too?
<Haku1013> Furries aren't actually furry
<mitamaking> Evil Joker line there
<weeping_pegasi82> uhuh sure
<KrazyNoobs> Oh, yeah... hehehe.... internet
<Ryunosuke> or the yiffydom? I ask casue YOU brought it up, and we never know with you :)
<Saturn> 08,01the furry fandom in a broad sense
<Haku1013> JOKER SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO KILL SANTA
<Saturn> 08,01some furries are, in fact, scaly
<KrazyNoobs> If this suddenly did become a furry based site, would clop be encouraged, and what would be streamed?
<Saturn> 08,01or feathery
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/AfexE.jpg oh hye, twinkies are saved
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: Rule 18: If it exists, there is a fetish of it
<mitamaking> KrazyNoobs: Weekly episodes, Sonic games, Star Fox Adventures
<Saturn> 08,01KrazyNoobs: we would still have the same age and content restrictions
<Bronysith> mitamaking: star fox adventures also sucks
<mitamaking> Bronysith: I like the game
<J_E_Smith71> Haku1013: If Batman weren't in a realstic setting...well not realstic realstic but you know what I mean
<KrazyNoobs> mitamaking: lol
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: okay
<J_E_Smith71> If I had stream power, I'd stream the Sonic games
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/kEDGU.jpg serves the little spoiled bitch right
<mitamaking> I will admit, Krystal is pretty much furry bait
<KrazyNoobs> Someone needs to stream BoonDocks.
<Bronysith> KrazyNoobs: scoots does
<DashWithRainbows> Already been done.
<mitamaking> Bronysith: Seems a bit extreme, I guess
<KrazyNoobs> You can call me the health inspector.
<Saturn> 08,01my god, i hate christmas so much
<Bronysith> Saturn: understandable
<Haku1013> Someone should stream... videos of a stream
<Saturn> 08,01that said, i my brother just opened his christmas present from me
<mitamaking> Saturn: Heart grow two sizes time
<Saturn> 08,01it was a watch, with built in tide and moon info
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: Same. My parents split up 4 days ago, so Christmas now officially sucks for me
<Saturn> 08,01i got it for him because he never knows what time it is
<Saturn> 08,01so now he does
<Saturn> 08,01and he also knows the moon phase and tide
<Major> Saturn: sounds awesome to me
<mitamaking> An observatory rocket

<Saturn> 08,01the only people who got me presents this year were people on the BUCK committee
<mitamaking> Bronysith: Now I'm sad
<Bronysith> Saturn: im sorry i didnt get you anything
<Major> Welp, theyre killing god knows how many people
<mitamaking> Bad A.I.
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: don't be; i tend to discourage people from getting me presents, seeing as i don't actually celebrate christmas
<Major> Saturn: these days, who does?
<Bronysith> Major: everyone usually
<killerpony7733> Major My family does >.>
<Bronysith> a LOT of people actually
<Bronysith> most of america
<Saturn> 08,01Major: most people, generally
<Bronysith> most christians
<DerpyMuffins> Joker=Pinkie Anyone agree?
<Saturn> 08,01okay, yeah, most people in the western world
<Saturn> 08,01most people on the planet don't
<Haku1013> nyeheheheheheheheh
<KrazyNoobs> inb4 religion argument
<ShizuKlaus> 13saturn celebrates festivus
<KrazyNoobs> I hate when they happen
<KrazyNoobs> I just leave
<Major> Saturn: around here only a few people have their lights up
<Bronysith> Major: cause Lights completely equals celebrating christmas
<Saturn> 08,01ShizuKlaus: well, actually, the closest i get to celebrating christmas is celebrating Saturnalia
<mitamaking> Abandoned toy factory, good old Gotham
<DerpyMuffins> How many abandoned factory are in Gotham?
<Bronysith> DerpyMuffins: 3
<Saturn> 08,01when i have children, the big winter holiday will be Saturnallia, not Christmas
<Major> Bronysith: can you go tonight without picking at somthing
<Saturn> 08,01and, of course, Hohmanay
<Saturn> 08,01*Hogmanay
<kidzrul732> somepony broke a pinkie promise!
<mitamaking> Nutcracker time
<killerpony7733> Saturn For me it's became dull and extremely annoying cause my family forces me and leaves me no choice but to participate and even today being so nice to stay for over 5+ more hours it was not enough for people like my big sister and my moms little sister.
<DerpyMuffins> CreepyC
<Bronysith> Major: well considering there are so many flaws in your comments, no
<NYC_Brony> Sup
<Major> Saturn: well your going to have to find a special somepony first
<kidzrul732> who's streaming?
<NYC_Brony> And Merry Christmas
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Convention Compilation - December 24th
<NYC_Brony> Sup And Merry Christmas Everypony
<Saturn> 08,01killerpony7733: to be honest, when i was young, it was me and my brother forcing my parents to have christmas
<Major> Bronysith: well arnt you a scrooge?
<Bronysith> NYC_Brony: hope you enjoy lots of messy food and love your family
<mitamaking> NYC_Brony: Happy Christmahanakwanza
<kidzrul732> whoever is streaming YOU PINKIE PROMISED!
<Saturn> 08,01my mum was brought up in india, and my dad doesn't celebrate christmas
<Haku1013> You know you're childhood is over when you actually DO celebrate christmas, but you just dont care for it all anymore
<Bronysith> Major: um, never said i hated christmas,
<Bronysith> like
<Bronysith> ever
<NYC_Brony> When do you open gifts, i will open mine on midnight
<kidzrul732> I thought you said, there won't be any streams during christmas time!
<Major> Bronysith: tis a joke that only I can get :P
<DerpyMuffins> Bat joke is bad
<KrazyNoobs> I celebrate Christmas, but for no religious reasons, just a tree and presents (and with my sister, Santa)
<NYC_Brony> :L
<mitamaking> I'm not religious but I think I will celebrate Christmas if I ever have a family
<weeping_pegasi82> snipers?
<killerpony7733> Saturn Haha but yeah now i honestly don't care for it. Too pointless your forced to buy things for your family when you don't want to and the likes.
<Major> Bronysith: because why feed the troll when you can laugh at him?
<mitamaking> I love this part
<Bronysith> Major: then why the fuck would you tell a joke that no one else in the world but you can get?
<Bronysith> so that the halls are filled with only your laughter and you look like a complete idiot
<Major> Bronysith: someone's being naughty
<mitamaking> open it
<Haku1013> Bronysith because it's funny. The world's greatest comedian always did jokes that only he was on.
<Haku1013> Andy Kaufman
<Bronysith> Major: yes i am browsing clop right now, but thats besides the point
<NYC_Brony> There is a lot of people in my house trying to type stuff on my laptop
<Bronysith> oh joker you so....joker
<Haku1013> NYC_Brony LEAVE HIM ALONE!
<Bronysith> too bad mark hamill is done with the batman games
<NYC_Brony> ?
<Major> Bronysith: then go back to your smut and leave me to my christmas
<DerpyMuffins> Who the fuck left a roller skate there?
<mitamaking> Bronysith: He said that after the first one
<Saturn> 08,01killerpony7733: the point when i realised that christmas was something i no longer wanted to participate in was in 2007: i had bought all my friends christmas gifts, spent literally hours wrapping them in white paper and sticking on bits of newspaper to make a funny sort of comic for each one, but i received nothing that year, not even from close friends or parents
<weeping_pegasi82> whoa
<Haku1013> NYEH
<J_E_Smith71> DerpyMuffins: Someone who hates the Joker
<Saturn> 08,01i suddenly realised that christmas was just an exercise in commercialism
<Ryunosuke> WELL
<mitamaking> Welp that was fun
<Ryunosuke> THAT HAPPENED TO ME
<J_E_Smith71> Thanks for that short stream Sumica
<Presents47> Thanks Sumi
<Ryunosuke> BUT.. THAT WAS FROM WORKKING WALMART FOR ONE SEASON
<DerpyMuffins> Christmas is about giving, not recieving Saturn
<Ryunosuke> oos
<Ryunosuke> sorry for the caps
<weeping_pegasi82> though recieving is pretty fun too
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: 1. For some people, Christmas is to celebrate the birth of their prophet, for everyone else, it is commercialism, but Halloween and Easter are the worst in terms of commercialism
<mitamaking> DerpyMuffins: That's easy enough to say, but you do want something
<Ryunosuke> black friday is/was hell
<Haku1013> Haku's christman left him gradually over the years. I just stopped caring for the holiday and more for the break from school
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/hHrlo.jpg hahahahahha,
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: 2. Sorry to hear that, hate when that happens
<DerpyMuffins> I got nothing for the last 3 Christmas and I don't really mind
<Kammerjunk> KrazyNoobs: Really? While I celebrate neither, I think things like Valentine's Day or Father's/Mother's Day are worse.
<J_E_Smith71> Saturn: Do you not care for the songs?
<Ryunosuke> brony... heheh
<killerpony7733> Saturn Yep but however i got no say. I'm forced to participate against my will forced to buy gifts against my will. The fact i just don't enjoy it. It adds up to really negative
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyMuffins: okay, i phrased that wrong; i didn't stop celebrating it because i didn't receive anything. i stopped celebrating it because upon analysing what happened that year, i realised that it was somethign that i didn't want to be celebrating
<Haku1013> hmm hmm
<mitamaking> Halloween is fun for what it is, Christmas is the same, Easter should never be commercialized
<Scootsy_Pie> Needs more yulelogs
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/0qnSq.png Saturn i know this is off topic, but should lighten the mood
<Scootsy_Pie> Where is my yulelog?
<mitamaking> Everyone is so sad, have a Miku Christmas song
<killerpony7733> Saturn Plus i don't get along with my big sister and my moms little sister those two just restrict me in everything and force me to do things and give me no choice and treat me if i was still a little kid who can't make his own choices and have his own lifestyle.
<J_E_Smith71> Is that Sumica? Are you switching back to the fireplace?
<DerpyMuffins> Capitalism don't you love it?
<Haku1013> nyeh
<mitamaking> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=KnG5f9trnmo
<J_E_Smith71> Yep
<J_E_Smith71> Refresh to go back to the fireplace
<Saturn> 08,01christmas is about 1) religion, 2) gift giving, 3) family, 4) a big meal
<mitamaking> I do appreciate capitalism, it means we live in a free society
<Kammerjunk> Christmas is about celebrating Pagan values.
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/jweHu.jpg
<Major> Bronysith: oh so thats what you do for a living....
<DerpyMuffins> Funny, considering Jesus was born in March
<Bronysith> Major: huh?
<Kammerjunk> But here in Denmark, Christmas is about celebrating that the few weeks of snow we get are hopefully gone.
<mitamaking> It's the Wii's biggest hit
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not religious, i can't afford gifts for everyone i want to give them to, and i don't like receiving gifts, i don't particularly like spending time with my family
<Sumica> 00,10one out of 4 is not bad I guess then.
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: When I move out of my family's house, I will stop Christmas too, because I, too, believe it is just commercialism at one of its worst forms.
<killerpony7733> Saturn Sums up how i feel about it too.
<Ryunosuke> i for one, do not appreciate capitalism, because that means that corporations are calling the shots, and that usually doesnt mean whats good for the people
<Ryunosuke> but enough of politics :)
<mitamaking> I like recieving gifts, I will not apologize for that
<Sumica> 00,10dose the big meal count if you are makeing it for some one else?
<Saturn> 08,01well, i'll use any excuse to cook a roast
<mitamaking> Sumica: Do you still eat it?
<Sumica> 00,10no
<mitamaking> then no
<Major> Bronysith: oh nothing, just go back to cloping infront of your roomate
<Sumica> 00,10oh then 0 out of 4
<mitamaking> Sorry Sumica
<Bronysith> Major: hell yea, clopping in front of roomates is fun, especially when they join in on the fun
<J_E_Smith71> Saturn: You forgot Christmas music and Tv specials/movies
<Bronysith> then it just becomes lots and lots of mess
<Bronysith> everywhere~
<Saturn> 08,01i hate the religious aspect, the commercialism aspect, and the family aspect
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Are you not treading thin ice good sir?
<KrazyNoobs> That... escalated... quickly...
<Major> Bronysith: and thats just disjusting....like you....
<Saturn> 08,01once you remove those, there's not much left to christmas
<Saturn> 08,01J_E_Smith71: i also hate TV
<Bronysith> Major: never said i was clean
<Kammerjunk> Wait, wait, wait. People still watch TV?
<mitamaking> Saturn: Do you like anything?
<Bronysith> Kammerjunk: baffles me
<Major> Bronysith: ah so you do live in a dumpster....
<J_E_Smith71> Saturn: Except MLP obivously
<Kammerjunk> Vests, maybe.
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn: Same (about your opinions of XMas)
<Saturn> 08,01mitamaking: i like people
<Saturn> 08,01(most of the time)
<Saturn> 08,01and i like sex
<Saturn> 08,01but that's not a topic for in here
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: I'm just happy this Christmas was spent with only my parents and siblings.
<Bronysith> Major: with access to the internet and hot food delivered daily, and my ps3, xbox 360 iphone and gaming pc,
<Bronysith> indeed
<Yahooz> Saturn: then why bring it up
*Bronysith suplexes Yahooz away
<Saturn> 08,01Yahooz: just thinking out loud, i guess
<Major> Bronysith: so thats why you never get any chicks.....
<Saturn> 08,01the thought that i sohuldn't talk about it in here came after the thought that i should mention it
<Saturn> 08,01it was kind of a backpedal
<mitamaking> Bronysith: It's a nice dumpster
<Bronysith> Major: Straight? ewww
<Bronysith> mitamaking: hell yea, you want in?
<Major> Bronysith: guys then

<Major> Bronysith: ponies?

<kidzrul732> I made Calvin and Hobbes comics on a site called Pixton
<Kammerjunk> TheGentlemanBrony: I'll tell ya, but it's nothing mindblowing.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm sure molestia can be romantic
<Bronysith> TheGentlemanBrony: you can make it romantic if you dont resist and actually enjoy it
<Saturn> 08,01just romantic + sex

<Saturn> 08,01or rather, none of those
<Saturn> 08,01i think i've actually mentioned it before
<Phase4> Saturn, because you have a large number of asteroids orbiting you in concentric rings?
<Saturn> 08,01but you have to guess; i'm not saying now
<DerpyMuffins> Because your two moons are round?
<TheGentlemanBrony> Its cus of Sega isn't it.
<QuinnThePegaSistta> maybe because your cold? Saturn

<Kammerjunk> Nah, save it.

<Kammerjunk> I'll stick with RedBubble. Last time I ordered two shirts from WeLoveFine, I ended up paying around $100.
<Kammerjunk> This is one of the reasons Denmark isn't an optimal place to live.
<Unnr> Kammerjunk IKR?
<Unnr> About welove's prices
<Kammerjunk> But hey, free health care and clouded skies all year.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk This year has been just rain rain rain rain rain

<killerpony7733> rain
<Unnr> Who needs the sun?
<Sun> yes
<Kammerjunk> killerpony7733: Not true. We got like 4 days of snow.
<Sun> ?
<Kammerjunk> And that's 4 days too many.
<Kammerjunk> And to be honest, I kind of like the rain as long as I have my jacket.
<r-dash> here in the east we just got 2 days of snow and that was in october
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/vChZQ.png
<Kammerjunk> I hate being in the rain. I also hate snow, hail and sunny skies.
<Kammerjunk> I hate the winter, summer and most of the spring.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk Yes we got snow for what like that amount of days? else it's been rain and only rain so much. Even rain made the snow go away
<Sun> wat do you love
<Kammerjunk> You know what I don't hate?
<Kammerjunk> I don't hate vests.
<killerpony7733> Kammerjunk So i'm guessing your name is francis then?
<Kammerjunk> I don't hate like half of autumn.
<killerpony7733> :D
<Kammerjunk> No, Kasper.
<killerpony7733> Aww
<Kammerjunk> Francis is best pony, though.

<Tom> not sure, can you have more than one bot from botserv?
<Big_Macintosh_1992> anyone want to be friends on steam?
<MakerDusk> /bs act for /me commands
*Tom is best rock
<thelonecubone> ah
<Jmo> That's enough puppet now Drew.
<Tom> Jmo, NO :<
<MakerDusk> you can only have one chanserv bot at a time
<Tom> Jmo, channel needs more tom
*TheGentlemanBrony is best gentleman
<Jmo> I'll cut off your Linux supply :I
*TheGentlemanBrony the inconsistent gentleman
<Ninjazz> Tom, you're not supposed to talk. Go home.
<Tom> Jmo, just try it
<Phase4> :P
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Ninjazz: Tom isn't talking...
<Big_Macintosh_1992> >_>
<Phase4> i'm making tom speak
<Jmo> Oh haha let's try tricking Jmo into getting booted.
<Ninjazz> But that voice...it isn't coming from Tom?

<Jmo> Just for you.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Ninjazz: why uh... no.... no tom here<_<
<Tom> Boo!
<Petrified_Discord> Ah! Ghost!
<Ninjazz> I knew it. Bronystate is haunted.
<Ninjazz> And it feeds on IQ. :O
<Petrified_Discord> These ghosts rock.
<PonyChat> however I am the god bot on the network
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Ninjazz: well... that explains why i can't hear tom talk then...
<Phase4> i could imagine tom wearing a ghostly gribbus
<Unnr> Beware the box ghoooost!
<Unnr> BEWARE!
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Unnr: lol
<DashWithRainbows> PonyChat is OP, pls remove frm gayme.

<DashWithRainbows> Lawls.
<Unnr> Le Gasp! Dun Dun Dunnnn
<Phase4> MakerDusk, you doing that or is kabaka?
*Big_Macintosh_1992 is scared
<MakerDusk> PonyChat scares me :(
<jcelios> "send messages through the bot itself" ". This has been removed on SwiftIRC because" " causing channel owners to be fooled into thinking the bot was a threat and getting their channel taken over or stolen." wat...
<MakerDusk> Phase4: me
<MakerDusk> it's not programmed to autorespond yet
*Jmo slaps MakerDusk around a bit with a large trout
<Major1> Merry Christmas Everypony :)
*Big_Macintosh_1992 also slaps MakerDusk around a bit with a large trout
<MakerDusk> Phase4: that's also annoying since I'm drunk and had to use TS6
<MakerDusk> XD
<Unnr> Phase4: Its the pegasus device´s first attempt to turn into Skynet, duh.
<SantaTheDuck> Merry Christmas Major1 :P

<MakerDusk> though that would make me a bad employee, I suppose XD
<Unnr> The bronies were sitting their monitors aglow
<SantaTheDuck> Why are you suffering cachi01|suffering? .-.
<cachi01|suffering> SantaTheDuck: family games
<jcelios> because of his evil mom
<Unnr> with hopes that Hasbro would keep with the show

<Unnr> the fireplace roared softly while many counted sheep
<MakerDusk> for studying science
<MakerDusk> Unnr: meepsheep? where?!!

<Unnr> When there in the room arouse such a clatter
<Unnr> The bronies looked quietly, to see what was the matter

<MakerDusk> Phase4: right now, I'd probably just voice myself XD
<Unnr> Away to EQD they went like a flash
<MakerDusk> wait... then I need 2 overrides... I'd op myself so it could later be taken away without an override XD
<Unnr> but the blog it was silent, nare´ a pick of swag ´stache
<Unnr> The moon tho´ aglow was bare in the sky
<Buytoast> if they're going to Sir Dragonstuffer's Slaphouse of Long Faced Pleasures then they don't deserve any gifts in the first place

<KrazyNoobs> My mom surprised me with a trampoline for Christmas. I was gone for 2 hours. I'm back now, Xd

<MakerDusk> Phase4: I can't even do that :s
<killerpony7733> Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down
<KrazyNoobs> They should make ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°) into the Pinkie G3 Face, that way, people would stop using it
<killerpony7733> :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Happy Hearth's Warming Eve everypony :)
<CrystalPhoenix> what's up buddies
<MakerDusk> I'd have to op myself first
<CrystalPhoenix> so I tried Bayonetta Hard mode
<thelonecubone> Hi Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<Unnr> As from the conveyance ponies did dive!
<texasboykc09> hello Sketch_Toku_Brony

<cachi01> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<MakerDusk> Phase4: great idea

<Unnr> Out, Fluttershy, out! Rainbow, out! Gummie and Pinkie!¨
<KrazyNoobs> I need to go and look up if Le Lenny Face, which is ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°), has any inappropriate meaning that would get me banned for using it, brb
<Unnr> Through the chat room they came, breaking the fourth wall
<KrazyNoobs> It is best to know about things before you use them,
<Ninjazz> It's just a plague.
<KrazyNoobs> Yep, it originated by 4chan, I'm not liking it thus far
<KrazyNoobs> I know they always use it
<Unnr> The bronies, to a man, faint they did all.
<KrazyNoobs> It was flooded on NEWS pages revolving the Israeli Airstrike... nothing that bad, so, uh... ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°)
<KrazyNoobs> Of course, people do find it annoying, so to avoid conflict, I'll minimally use it
<Unnr> as concious they came, to see pegasuses fly,
<KrazyNoobs> That awkward moment when 50% of all comments thus far are owned by you. I need to quiet down a little bit
<cachi01|ZahmbieU> its called le Lenny face
<cachi01|ZahmbieU> also known as
<KrazyNoobs> ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°)
<cachi01|ZahmbieU> The israeli face
<Unnr> this night, the awesome, brought tears to the eye
<thelonecubone> cachi01|ZahmbieU: orly?
<MakerDusk> KrazyNoobs: I'm the most active person on the network by far
<KrazyNoobs> I love that fire.
<Ninjazz> I knew it as the Lel face. You got banned on /b/ for usig it.
<MakerDusk> so I can't say anything there
<MakerDusk> the amount I've spoken is measured in GB XD
<KrazyNoobs> MakerDusk: There is no "most active person", you just analyse the last 10 comments and find out how many of them you posted.
<Ninjazz> You have very expensice conversations, Dusky.
<Ninjazz> expensive*
<MakerDusk> Ninjazz: expensive how?
<MakerDusk> other than the network fees
<Unnr> SO into the channel, Pinkie she came
<MakerDusk> y'all should donate one of these days XD
<Unnr> Giggling and gasping, enjoying her fame
<Phase4> ponychat accepts donations?
<MakerDusk> we've gotten one donation in the entirety of the network's life XD
<MakerDusk> Phase4: of course
<MakerDusk> we have 10 servers
<MakerDusk> XD
<Ninjazz> MakerDusk, oh wait. The amount you've "spoken". I thuoght you said when you speak it costs GBs. I only have 150 gbs in this netbook so... that's sounds very expensive.
<KrazyNoobs> Le Lenny Face is best face [14:49:12] < ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°)
<Phase4> if the website would load i'd try make that 2
<Unnr> And then with a fanfair Celestia set out her hoof
<Unnr> while there in her shadow, stood Luna, aloof.
<Unnr> (eep, bio calls)
<Phase4> MakerDusk, yay donations!
<MakerDusk> Phase4: are you saying cadence is down:O
<Phase4> MakerDusk, no, my phone is just bleh
<MakerDusk> Phase4: you donated?!!
<Phase4> that i did
<KrazyNoobs> I am going to enjoy my new present more, biyee
<MakerDusk> KrazyNoobs: don't burn down the whole neighbourhood XD
<MakerDusk> Phase4: midget is going to die of shock XD
<Phase4> pulling 35MB over hsdpa
<Phase4> XD
<KrazyNoobs> MakerDusk: I also got a trampoline.
<MakerDusk> KrazyNoobs: laser and trampoline... add some alcohol and have some fun XD
<KrazyNoobs> MakerDusk: But yes, when I use my new 500mW Green, I will be sure not to burn down too much of the neighbourhood.
<KrazyNoobs> MakerDusk: :)
<VenHur> Now due to insufficent funds, my dad or anyone else in my family couldn't gived me a present, which is a shame. I really wanted a Wii U...
<KrazyNoobs> VenHur: Sorry bout that, bro
<KrazyNoobs> Well, I'm off
<KrazyNoobs> Le Lenny Face is best face [14:48:32] ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°)
<MakerDusk> this year I opted not to give my family presents
<VenHur> But on the bright side, It could allowance COULD be enough for a video game.
<MakerDusk> haven't gotten anything from them in 8 years anyways
<MakerDusk> unless you count coal one year
<Major1> Merry Christmas <3
<Phase4> i can't buy presents :(
<Unnr> (annnd back, where was I...)
<VenHur> I'm thinking of Assassin's Creed, Infamous, or any other famous PS3 titles.
<Unnr> (Ah yes)
<Phase4> honestly cant figure what to get people
<MakerDusk> Phase4: monitors
<MakerDusk> there is no such thing as too many of those XD
<Major1> Phase4: you can buy me a laptop :3
<Unnr> Between them, there floated a rather large pack
<Phase4> Major1, i no has enough money to buy laptop :(
<Major1> Phase4: then can you buy me AC3? :(
<Unnr> And from it came presents, as did one... Big Mac
<Phase4> Major1, but... money D:
<MakerDusk> Phase4: don't worry: if the proof of concept goes well, me and midget are totally cutting #geek in XD
<ouo> RACIST BARN RACIST BARN 1 2 3 4
<Unnr> Their eyes, they did twilkled, the Pinkie how merry
<kully6745> http://www.livestream.com/feedbacklounge2 mic is giving out prizes for correct answers to questions
<Phase4> : D
<MakerDusk> err... I drunk
<Phase4> ouo, i heard rasin barn
<MakerDusk> there is no proof of concept that generates a min of 50k a year
<Unnr> as bronies did feast on warm chimi-cherrys
<MakerDusk> >_>
<MakerDusk> <_<
<Phase4> kully6745, i belive that is stream advertising which is against our rules
<killerpony7733> kully6745 Read the rules here.
<ouo> seems legit
<Major1> Phase4: at all?
<Phase4> also i have a shiny new @
<Unnr> ´til Celestia did speak, coat white as fresh snow
<Unnr> thanking those, one and all, for beleiving in the show
<Presents47> Dat Phase4 with a @ O.O
<thelonecubone> Looks good on you, Phase4 :)
<kully6745> http://www.livestream.com/feedbacklounge2
<VenHur> So that means Phase4's an admin?
<Unnr> but morning did strike and the ponies, they rose
<thelonecubone> and anothe advertisment
<thelonecubone> another*
<Phase4> is k, kicked him
<thelonecubone> cool
<SantaTheDuck> VenHur, indeed
<Ninjazz> Actually, I just noticed that Phase got promoted.
<Phase4> hopefully he gets the message
<killerpony7733> Lets see if he learns
<Phase4> i don't yet know how to ban
*Presents47 pats Phase4 on the head and gives him a cookie
<Ninjazz> What took so long, Phase?
<Phase4> and if he forces me to read documentation then i'ma permban
<Phase4> Ninjazz, lazy
<Ninjazz> Know that feel.
<VenHur> Congratulations for achieving admin status, Phase4, now the question is, What will you will streams?
<Phase4> VenHur, uh... ponies?
<SantaTheDuck> Phase4, ewwwww
<VenHur> Phase4: Fair enough. XD
<ouo> pone
<SantaTheDuck> Why do you stream ponies, they're so gay
<Presents47> So Phase4 is a mod now? O.O

<Buytoast> Don't give it to him
<jcelios> I thought Tom did spam kicks?
<Drew> I've only been here for 4 weeks
<Buytoast> give it to me
<VenHur> Phase4 is now clarified as a modderator. Modderators get to streams thier choice of picks.
<Buytoast> I have a name with no numbers
<Buytoast> it's a fresh start

<Buytoast> the flippy floppy top screens
<Buytoast> and the back light
<Unnr> Buytoast: then why not the original DS?
<CrystalPhoenix> WOAH
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well since a lot of kicks come from youtube vids during stream, you could add something like :youtubeOn :youtubeoff and make the kick script look for youtube.com
<CrystalPhoenix> I just click on something weird on steam
<Buytoast> because the 3DS plays DS games
<Buytoast> but not game boy games
<VenHur> Sucks that the newer DS models doesn't had GBA slots.
<DerpyMuffins> When is the wedding Luna?
*Luna 07,01hugs everypony that wants a hug
<Unnr> But the first gen DS plays GBA games
<Major1> Luna: <3

<Major1> MakerDusk: Here Here!
<MakerDusk> 8,05and yes, I read the blog XD
*Unnr offers MakerDusk some more scotch.
<VenHur> Mainly because on the 3DS/XL Virtual Console, you get to DOWNLOAD the handheld games of earlier handhelds.
<Luna> 07,01will dedicate a blogpost to it tomorrow
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> then streamers wouldn't have to be giving warning during streams for that
<Luna> 07,01but since you have me on fb.. you can see the gift ;)
<VenHur> Apple cider, anypony?
<Buytoast> never touched the virtual 3DS thing
<Major1> Luna: yay~

*SantaTheDuck passes the bag of marshmallows around chat

*PaladinDrakkenwolf beats out flaming marshmallow
<Jmo> You love using your colours today, don't you?
<Phase4> i should try kick MakerDusk as he is technically breaking the rules, though that would probably be a pointless endeavour
<Jmo> 'try'
<Phase4> Sumica's script is probably going nuts trying to kick him anyway
<PonyChat> shut up MakerDusk: just hug her again!
<MakerDusk> ...
*MakerDusk hugs a Luna ^_^
<BroPony|MEDIC> the fire never burns dont it

<Sun> burn baby burn
<MakerDusk> Phase4: does that help?
<BroPony|MEDIC> remember everypony, it pays to be a medic
<MakerDusk> DerpyMuffins: I work in a higher capacity here than at microsoft
<Phase4> didnt realise dari was running a colour kick
<Phase4> though sumi's closer to a server so
<MakerDusk> they're angry at me right now so they're forcing me to do base Office tech support
<MakerDusk> >_<
<DerpyMuffins> Do it for Luna MakerDusk
<MakerDusk> kick myself?
<Luna> 07,01Do what? :)
<Unnr> MakerDusk: Aiiiee, a fate worse than death.

<KrazyNoobs> Hi, I'm baack
<BroPony|MEDIC> wb KrazyNoobs
*MakerDusk hugs the engaged Luna once again :D
<MakerDusk> I am so happy for you!
<DerpyMuffins> You can only bend the rules so much MakerDusk
<Unnr> Luna: I´m still squeeing.
<MakerDusk> DerpyMuffins: technically I bent them over a year ago when I set the exemption and then not again since XD
<KrazyNoobs> Trampolines are fun, but if my dad were still around, he could have shown me some aerobics. :(
<KrazyNoobs> air tricks
<KrazyNoobs> whatever they are called
<BroPony|MEDIC> my hand is killing me
<cachi01|ZahmbieU> kill it
<cachi01|ZahmbieU> before it kills you
*MakerDusk hugs KrazyNoobs, "there, there"
<DerpyMuffins> How long does it take for you to hack BState than MakerDusk
<BroPony|MEDIC> i cant, its my dominant left hand
<BroPony|MEDIC> I NEED IT
<KrazyNoobs> Sorry, I worded that wrong. He split up 4 days ago, he ain't dead.
<MakerDusk> DerpyMuffins: bronystate are my friends :s
<Luna> 07,01As am I :) Despite my situation I cant stop smiling
<thelonecubone> cachi01|ZahmbieU: so, hows the game so far?
<MakerDusk> why would I even consider that?
<cachi01|ZahmbieU> thelonecubone: main menu and theme song is awesome. havent played the game :D
<KrazyNoobs> I need to cool off, anyways.
<Unnr> MakerDusk: But what about the Geeks MakerDusk. You´re tearing us apart! Oh him mark.
<DerpyMuffins> For security purposes MakerDusk
*KrazyNoobs turns off fire video
<thelonecubone> cachi01|ZahmbieU: oh, Lol
<male_writer> Hey everyone.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So has it been nothing but fire all day?
<KrazyNoobs> Hi male_writer
<DerpyMuffins> Yup
<MakerDusk> DerpyMuffins: that's what the GNAA is for XD
<KrazyNoobs> I
*BroPony|MEDIC is trying to decipher the problem
<MakerDusk> did you know that they're targetting microsoft right now trying to get under my skin?
<MakerDusk> lol
<Phase4> GNAA's already tried to hack BronyState, they're not exactly a high tech group
<MakerDusk> Phase4: exactly XD
*BroPony|MEDIC back to the drawing board :|
<MakerDusk> luckily most of the world are technological idiots XD
<Guest25879> it's a pixel?
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4: I used to be part of them, they are all expert trolls, but in terms of intellegence, really stupid.
<Guest25879> hey, when did I become a guest?
<MakerDusk> bronystate: how does you see a stream?
<Unnr> MakerDusk: That made me think of the beginning of 2001.... >_<
<BroPony|MEDIC> GNAA?
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4: And yes, there are plenty of bronies in the GNAA.
<Phase4> KrazyNoobs, orly?
<DerpyMuffins> MakerDusk BState did get hacked before
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins, didn't, mips did
<MakerDusk> DerpyMuffins: not by gnaa, thought they claimed the credit
<thelonecubone> KrazyNoobs: how stupid, Define it for me pls
<thelonecubone> ?
<MakerDusk> it was a matter of the mips key being in the iframe
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4: Yeah, but I don't have much to do with them anymore. The 3 blokes that hacked our stream were the low class part of GNAA.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfpEhIQhUxc&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
<SantaTheDuck> Yeah I thought there was no confirmation on who hacked mips
<MakerDusk> a complete security fail on the part of the service
<Phase4> KrazyNoobs, can't all be that stupid, i meen they did set up that freenode spam a while ago
<MakerDusk> KrazyNoobs: gnaa denied it XD
<MakerDusk> any involvement
<ShizuKlaus> 13phase will hate me for it but i'm switching ftb packs... again...
<thelonecubone> Phase4: Freenode spa,?
*gdlk_ouo grump
<thelonecubone> spam*
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Tetris time! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBj-wRSx7v0&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
<Phase4> ShizuKlaus, nah, i've got to try a bunch of them out anyway
<KrazyNoobs> thelonecubone: Well, in IRL, most of them are bronies, fats, straight and white, but they roleplay while on the internet. They pretend to be homosexuals and black, while they all also pretend to be haters of mlp.
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: is it your script that I break every time I use colour?
<Phase4> have an idea but it'd require modifying redpower
<texasboykc09> Phase4, how did they tried to hack thie site again
<ShizuKlaus> 13MakerDusk: i don't run any autokicks
<Phase4> or replacing it
<thelonecubone> KrazyNoobs: ah, i see
<gdlk_ouo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMKTdrQqpNk
<Phase4> texasboykc09, attempted XSS on the search bar
<Afflict> A while ago
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I am the man who arranges the blocks
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: I noticed, otherwise I'd totally tease you with the overrides XD
<ShizuKlaus> 13Phase4: atm i'm hoping to settle on direwolf20 pack, has all the updates and doesn't include the server crashy fail of twilight forest or overreaching junk of gregtech
<MakerDusk> I thought dari wrote the bots
<CrystalPhoenix> urgh Brentafloss
<Jmo> Na, Elsie writes the bots.
<Jmo> Surprise.
<Phase4> direwolf20 pack looked good, tried it for a minute
<texasboykc09> Phase4, XSS?
<Phase4> texasboykc09, cross site scripting
<KrazyNoobs> thelonecubone: They use the name and their identities to confuse people who they hack (news channels, websites, etc.
<MakerDusk> man, when I first started off here I was so intimidated by everyone XD
<ShizuKlaus> 13it's the most updated for the moment, includes mystcraft
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaI7cy5OLAM&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
<SantaTheDuck> MakerDusk, how so?
<Phase4> KrazyNoobs, do you know who set up the cross protocol freenode troll?
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyurem[WoW], I love you
<Luna> 07,01hm what to do now <3
<MakerDusk> SantaTheDuck: I was a straight up physicist, nothing else
<Phase4> MakerDusk, same bro /)
<GabeMoist> Hai gais
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh hey Luna havent seen you in awhile
<Phase4> MakerDusk, i was even less XD
<MakerDusk> and there was dari, busy programming bots that kicked people XD
<ShizuKlaus> 13luna~<3
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> welcome Gabe, come roast some Marshmallows
<Luna> 07,01Shizuuuuu
<MakerDusk> scary stuff!
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4: No, most of the people are anonymous users. Only about 10% of the GNAA actually went with it.
*ShizuKlaus 13brings luna presents <3
<Stormy> disconnected, weird
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4: If I had an identity, I will happily tell you
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Are any of you a good demoman?
<KrazyNoobs> of the hacker
<EngagedLuna> 07,01dat nick
<MakerDusk> wait... is ShizuKlaus a girl?
<ShizuKlaus> 13many grats luna <33

<Sylandest> ...w-wait. THE Luna?
<Phase4> MakerDusk, -_-
<MakerDusk> her syntax seems girlish
<CrystalPhoenix> so guys
<KrazyNoobs> Also, back in 2011, many people used to "crapspam" this chat.
<ShizuKlaus> 13you did not know?
<CrystalPhoenix> favorite version of fly me to the moon now
*SpadeKyurem[WoW] is a good demoman
<ShizuKlaus> 13all this time?
<EngagedLuna> 07,01I did!
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: I forget >_<
<DerpyMuffins> Haha MakerDusk you funny
<MakerDusk> and I've been nomming on you and everything
<Phase4> yeah, it's easy to forget gender on irc, doesnt really matter much
*MakerDusk flees out of fear and embarassemnt
<KrazyNoobs> Crapspamming is the process of sending 100 posts or something like that per second via. custom software.
<ShizuKlaus> 13i would think pink is a giveaway ><
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Put dispenser here!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Need a dispenser here!
<weeping_pegasi82> woo! just finished drawing earth pony armor!
<GabeMoist> ShizuKlaus, pink is considered a manly color these days
<MakerDusk> ya... welcome to irc where pink means nothing
<Unnr> ShizuKlaus: It could just mean you are a pinkie pie fan..... >_>
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> its not pink, its light-ish red
<soulrider95> but Phase4 how else am I supposed to be ignorant and sexist and racist?? >:)
<Afflict> hey Kimori
<KrazyNoobs> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: ERECTIN' a dispenser. *bzzzz*
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> MakerDusk you would have prefered noming on a guy ? (don't kill me)
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> PaladinDrakkenwolf: R Vs B reference /)
<Phase4> soulrider95, to peoples faces?
<thelonecubone> weeping_pegasi82: Cool, Are you gonna Post it?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: (\
<BroPony|MEDIC> bye everyone
<soulrider95> but Phase4, in real life they would kill me D:
<DerpyMuffins> I don't suppose you can hack a satellite MakerDusk?
<Phase4> soulrider95, :3
<EngagedLuna> 07,01Hmm should ask my hubby to wear pink tomorrow then
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> BroPony|MEDIC: dream of ponies
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4: Do you need to know the identity of the hacker?
<weeping_pegasi82> thelonecubone: eeyup! but I have to wait...:(
<SantaTheDuck> Bye BroPony|MEDIC
<GabeMoist> EngagedLuna, do it
<MakerDusk> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I'm straight... but that only means things can be taken the wrong way >_<
<thelonecubone> oh
<Phase4> KrazyNoobs, nah, just curious
<thelonecubone> Bye BroPony|MEDIC :)
<BroPony|MEDIC> PaladinDrakkenwolf: I always do :)
<MakerDusk> DerpyMuffins: I don't want to go to jail
<Phase4> KrazyNoobs, we run 90% stock wordpress, if there was any real problem someone would now
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> MakerDusk xD
<EngagedLuna> 07,01I will and I shall
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4: If you wanted, I could go to their N-----NET and see if I could find out.
<MakerDusk> also, I'd need cash to make the antenna
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> theres this pink shirt with "Real men wear pink" on the front, you should consider that as a future gift
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4: ah, okay
<DerpyMuffins> I'm joking MakerDusk xD
<MakerDusk> a geo-orbital tracking antenna array is expensive :s
<DerpyMuffins> Accept the compliment MakerDusk
<soulrider95> Can't wait to open all dem gifts tomorrow
<ShizuKlaus> 13say phase, would octopress do us any good or are we basically 90% static as is?
<MakerDusk> other than that, the us military uses .net 1.0
<MakerDusk> stupidity at it's max
*Phase4 googles octopress
<ShizuKlaus> 13not that i really want to set out plans for bronystate 3.0... nooo thank you...
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> 2.1 ?
<MakerDusk> did you know that the drones are controlled via mirc scriptsÉ
<DerpyMuffins> I'd go for 2.5 before 3.0
<KrazyNoobs> BronyState is beyond awesome already.
<Kimori> hello
<MakerDusk> I feel like that would be nothing special to me >_<
<Ninjazz> It'll be like Bronystate 2.0 all over again.
<soulrider95> v9000.1
<Kandarihu> ShizuKlaus, what plans do you have for Bronystate 3.0?
<ShizuKlaus> 13i don't ><
<Phase4> ShizuKlaus, well if we were to move away from wordpress it'd be best to try for something thats a bit faster
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ShizuKlaus have plans for total world domination.
<weeping_pegasi82> I like bronystate the way it is... DON'T BECOME ANOTHER YOUTUBE!
<Phase4> prefferably able to handle our load without so much caching
<soulrider95> ShizuKlaus: blackjack and hookers?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I remember back when they first started, they showed some anime after their first movie Superman 4
<abbbba> Bronystate 3.0 will have a muffin dispenser
<Phase4> we're about at the limits of what wordpress can be made to do right now
<MakerDusk> wait... ShizuKlaus is a tech girl geek... :O
<weeping_pegasi82> ...
<MakerDusk> such a rarity
<Phase4> MakerDusk, ...
<Unnr> Phase4: That´s because wordpress is a steaming pile of hate
<ShizuKlaus> 13no i am a shizu, not rarity
<weeping_pegasi82> MakerDusk: u so silly
<otakon> Merry Crhristmas everyone!
<ShizuKlaus> 13vivi is rarity

<GabeMoist> Merry Kwanza otakon
<MakerDusk> weeping_pegasi82: I'm having nightmarish flashbacks to the women in my physics and math programs >_<
*PaladinDrakkenwolf hands bag of marshmallows to otakon
<otakon> EngagedLuna: um... does that mean what I think it means?
<MakerDusk> I feel so bad for the people they are dating
<EngagedLuna> 07,01it sure does
<otakon> :)
*GabeMoist claps for Luna
*otakon hugs EngagedLuna "GOOD FOR YOU!"
<Stormy> hi

<otakon> weeping_pegasi82: what do you think?
<weeping_pegasi82> nevermind!
<EngagedLuna> 07,01danke :3
<KrazyNoobs> But yeah, last time I had any involvement in the GNAA was around June or July.
<weeping_pegasi82> I used my noggin
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: congrats, you somehow inadvertedly gave me nightmares for the next month or so XD
<otakon> MakerDusk: lol
<MakerDusk> (if only I wasn't joking)
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WHURR
<gdlk_ouo> >nightmarish flashbacks so true
<Phase4> weeping_pegasi82, ye gods man, that's dangerous D:
<ShizuKlaus> 13ye gods
<soulrider95> time for some DnB and chillwave :)
<KrazyNoobs> I decided that being in that group meant nothing, and that the whole thing was stupid anyway.
<DerpyMuffins> What's the most legal thing you can hack MakerDusk?
<ShizuKlaus> 13phase is a user friendly reader?
<MakerDusk> DerpyMuffins: nothing
<Unnr> Crud Puppy? Where?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Geddan
<Phase4> ShizuKlaus, i was at one point, lost track of most comics though
<ShizuKlaus> 13yay ufies~
<weeping_pegasi82> Phase4: I KNOW! I almost killed myself
<texasboykc09> Phase4, the site has to change agian by what you said?
<MakerDusk> unless you want me to hack together a program that does something innovative
<ShizuKlaus> 13i stopped reading a long while ago though, i think about when he had that long hiatus
<ShizuKlaus> 13link of the day was my reddit back then :P
<Phase4> i stopped reading after getting through most of the backlog, it was getting a little silly
<MakerDusk> wait... ShizuKlaus is on reddit too o_O
<Phase4> MakerDusk, you must be new here
<KrazyNoobs> brb in a few
<weeping_pegasi82> MakerDusk: why is your right eye so much bigger than your left?
<MakerDusk> Phase4: I'm now afraid to go on reddit
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> brb brushie brushie brushing my teethies
<jcelios> MakerDusk: wait, what was that about girls in Math and Physics classes, and nightmares? I'm going for a Physics Degree and your starting to scare me D:

<EngagedLuna> 07,01okay okay I stop!
*soulrider95 hums mediumly?
<weeping_pegasi82> EngagedLuna: good :D
<MakerDusk> jcelios: for the love of celestia don't date a woman physicist or math major
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_2Jduxc2P8&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
<Phase4> my, what an interestingly titled EQD post
<Unnr> jcelios: there are a suprisingly large # of those that feel that since they have... womanly parts... they are entitled to everything
<EngagedLuna> 07,01new EQD post: LUNA GOT ENGAGED!
<weeping_pegasi82> EQD or Dari messed up again
<MakerDusk> jcelios: they redefine mindgames: you will lose and embarassingly so
<Phase4> EQD, you screwed up the title
<weeping_pegasi82> CONGRATS!
<ShizuKlaus> 13MakerDusk: what about a woman networking major...ish..
<Phase4> mfw there is luna pic XD
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: unknown
<MakerDusk> and that scares me most of all
<EngagedLuna> 07,01hahaha
<ShizuKlaus> 13:3c
<Unnr> ShizuKlaus: IT or MIS networking?
<Phase4> MakerDusk, try electronics, there are no women
<Phase4> like anywhere
<Phase4> i think there was one in the lecture
<ShizuKlaus> 13IT, more specifically it was for CCNA
<soulrider95> ShizuKlaus: how is networking? I plan to do that or computer technician stuff after this year.
<MakerDusk> Phase4: there are here :s
<MakerDusk> lots of theme
<Unnr> Phase4,come here and join the comp engineer classes then
<ShizuKlaus> 13though the program included some windows admin, active directory, and a bit of linux too
<ShizuKlaus> 13at least i think.. the linux might have been all elective on my part...
<MakerDusk> eww AD
<soulrider95> active directory is the definition of fun
<Phase4> Unnr, there's plenty in the cs courses
<Phase4> they have their own clubs and everything
<ShizuKlaus> 13so fun story i've told a couple times
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> In other news, weed http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHwyca7gu7E&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> software engineering for me only 3 girls on my group

<ShizuKlaus> 13only girl in the AD class
<ShizuKlaus> 13we take a night learning about movetree
<MakerDusk> err... I mean microsoft is the best... the propoganda they force on me once a month says so
<ShizuKlaus> 13or trying to
<Phase4> active directory confuses me
<weeping_pegasi82> ugh I'm in some business web design class, and let me tell you HTML codes are fun and all but it can be so boring sometimes
<Phase4> what's it suposed to do?
<ShizuKlaus> 13moving an object from one domain to another
<Phase4> Unnr, ah
<Phase4> woah lags
<Unnr> VLSI = <3
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I still dont fucking get whats so good about Linux
<DerpyMuffins> Hey MakerDusk, wanna hit a bank together? I'm gonna major in electrical engineering
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: I bet you'd kill for my internal microsoft DB access
<ShizuKlaus> 13when i think what they WANT you to do is set up trusts between domains
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> im not a Windows fanatic but still
<Unnr> Oh ye boys of #bronystate
<MakerDusk> fucking j#
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], it's not as hideously complex and impenetrable as windows
<ShizuKlaus> 13anyway movetree has a very very specific syntax, have to specify the FQDNs of the source and destination and the domain controllers and i forget what else
<Unnr> if you want to meet women in college, go into biology or one of its related fields
<MakerDusk> the day I learned that was a language...
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], you can immediately learn how it works and how to make it do stuff
<soulrider95> I'm the server manager for my high school. Pretty fun stuff.
<weeping_pegasi82> you guys lost me when you got all techy
<ShizuKlaus> 13sat down with movetree /? for like three minutes, wrote out the command, object moved perfectly
<Phase4> i've only been able to figure out windows after pretty much learning linux
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well Goodnight, Happy christmas, kwanzaa, hanukkah or whatever
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh please Windows isnt that fucking hard for me to use
<ShizuKlaus> 13apparently i was the first one to get movetree right in like five years of the guy teaching the course
<Unnr> Don
<weeping_pegasi82> night TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<MakerDusk> the day I learned that j# exists is the first time I told the customer to buy a new computer while laughing insanely
<Unnr> Ǵah
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So you can learn shit faster, that doesnt make it better
<Unnr> Don´t get eaten by the Yule Cat
<Unnr> Jólakötturinn is on the prowl
<MakerDusk> they were angry at me and had me doing vista support at the time
<Phase4> BerryPunch, stop getting drunk pls
<MakerDusk> they always seem to be angry with me >_<
<soulrider95> there is only one thing that annoys me in IT. the users :<
<MakerDusk> but even the execs are afraid of me :(
<Phase4> ^
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ekrnc4xZcf4&list=PLpwxB8U_3wksmLl9cSfemLkHcd4h5KoVJ&index=33 Needs more Metal Harbor
<Phase4> everything would work perfectly if those silly users didnt screw it up
<ShizuKlaus> 13linux' strength is in the community and range of software support, windows' strength is everything else
<texasboykc09> ^^
*weeping_pegasi82 waits in a bunker until the tech talk passes
<gdlk_ouo> meh womans in all major scares me, there is now womens in all branch that you should consider like womens :3
<jcelios> ShizuKlaus: sounds like a bad case of RTFM XD
<ShizuKlaus> 13linux has spent the last dozen years chipping away at windows' advantages though
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> That still doesnt make it suprior to everything else
<soulrider95> HOW DO COMPUTER? IS BUTTON DO STUFF OR IS MIND GAMES?
*Phase4 pulls weeping_pegasi82 out of his bunker
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: you should see what bing looks like internally :D
<texasboykc09> weeping_pegasi82, ikr
<ShizuKlaus> 13ohgod
<ShizuKlaus> 13ohgodbing
<soulrider95> ugh bing
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Never used Bing
<ShizuKlaus> 13remember, when microsoft did it, it was antitrust
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: it is the best search engine I've ever used
<ShizuKlaus> 13when google does it, it's google
<weeping_pegasi82> please no Phase4 I'm just an artist!
<EngagedLuna> 07,01so much techtalk..
<Unnr> MakerDusk: I always assumed it was the tortured souls of fired Microsoft Helpdesk
*EngagedLuna 07,01head hurts
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Why the fuck is windows so "evil"
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: you can do full boolean type searches in it
*Unnr sneaks up and gives Luna another hug
<MakerDusk> multiple databases at once
<thelonecubone> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: they want your money?
<EngagedLuna> 07,01yay more hugs <3
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], try do something simple like clone a hard drive
<soulrider95> I like windows 8.
*weeping_pegasi82 hands aspirin to EngagedLuna
<MakerDusk> and full internet meta search
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Everyone wants your fucking money
<Unnr> mmm, dd
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Microsoft is no different
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], the windows method is paying some one a lot of money for some hypercomplex program thats full of bugs
*DerpyMuffins gives EngagedLuna some advil
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh please like ANYTHING doesnt have bugs in it
<MakerDusk> soulrider95: I'm sorry, they started hating me before I finished the windows 8 guide, so I deleted it out of spite
<Phase4> the linux metod is devices are exposed under /dev, so you can litterally copy the drive as you would any other file
<MakerDusk> as such, the forced me into fucking Office training
<MakerDusk> best part is sleeping
<thelonecubone> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: wow, you had WOW title for sometime, You've been playing that game for sometime :P
<soulrider95> Phase4 Windows 8 isn't bad btw. I like the new start menu better than the old one, and its based on a much better kernel this time around.
<thelonecubone> had the*
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], theres a difference betwene 'minor bugs' and 'OMG CRASH BLUESCREEN' that i was talking about
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I havent had a blue screen in years
<Phase4> soulrider95, >metro
<soulrider95> Bluescreen is to protect the hardware, that is it
<Phase4> >better
<ShizuKlaus> 13ew start screen
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: so fuck that
<Phase4> what is this i dont even
<Tassadork> windows 8 actually causes me pain
<ShizuKlaus> 13gimme mah menu
<Unnr> Advantage, Everything´s a file... disadvantage, everything´s a file...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You're starting to sound like a elitest
<gdlk_ouo> meh opensource full of bugs too
*Unnr grumbles at x11 setup
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: you don't know the advanced user features
<gdlk_ouo> but it's less ugly
<soulrider95> bluescreen is only to protect computer hardware from bad code, not anything else.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> One isnt nessicarily better than the other
<Tassadork> I made a shortcut to the start folder, gave a windows icon, and put it where the start menu used to be =/
<weeping_pegasi82> I usually just hit my laptop with a rock until it works :/
<Phase4> Unnr, yeah, i'm seeing some interesting ideas from stuff like powershell, but the complexity of it runis its use as a shell
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: I've not written anything up on them, so it's non-doccumented
<CrystalPhoenix> SpadeKyurem[WoW], are you coding?
<ShizuKlaus> 13win8 task manager makes me happy, but asuka's staying where she is
<gdlk_ouo> and some commercial soft actually good
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> CrystalPhoenix: No, but my point fucking stands
<gdlk_ouo> but i regret paying for this
<Unnr> Phase4: Obviously its time for there to be another OS in the market! >_>
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: the advanced user features all match or exceed the taskmanager
<Phase4> Unnr, it'd be nice to have some system of metadata, but i cant figure a good way to impliment it
<soulrider95> ShizuKlaus: The thing is, win7, vista, xp, etc. are based on the CE kernel. Windows 8 is based on the NT kernel, so the underlying stuff is much more stable.
<ShizuKlaus> 13i think out of everything i need to know one thing
<Phase4> Unnr, i actually thing its about time for that, unix is starting to age
<ShizuKlaus> 13is the win8 command prompt sane?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Every OS has its advantages
<ShizuKlaus> 13like is it not the exact same holdover we've had from DOS?
<Phase4> soulrider95, uh... windows > 2000 used the nt kernel
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> pfft DOS
<weeping_pegasi82> ok I'm just going to listen to some music until the tech talk ends ok? ok 6_9
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The fuck is DOS?
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: what are you trying to do?
<Phase4> soulrider95, CE > some number also uses the nt kernel
<Unnr> Phase4: Agreed, actually, but it would be hard to get support without having some serious built-in emulation support
<gdlk_ouo> win8 ... why they need a phone from my desktop?
<CrystalPhoenix> >not knowing DOS
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cJ4kQSOnA&list=PLpwxB8U_3wksmLl9cSfemLkHcd4h5KoVJ
<Tassadork> ShizuKlaus: it's just as stable and useless as the one in win7...
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], a fancy bootloader someone sold as an operating system
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DOS = Disk Operating System
<MakerDusk> ShizuKlaus: I'm drunk enought that if I can't answer it in one line, I'll screenshot the internals XD
<ShizuKlaus> 13MakerDusk: anything with the command prompt, linux terminals understand resizing but windows cmd has always lived in its own world
<TrixieMuffin> DOS : dat operating system
<Phase4> Unnr, can't be too hard to emulate linux's abi
<soulrider95> I am going to continue to run windows until another OS has better game support.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yup
<rdash> ^
<Phase4> Unnr, plus it'd be unix based
<ShizuKlaus> 13iirc they changed something about it in xp but otherwise the command prompt is about the same as it was in win95
<Phase4> soulrider95, *cough* steam *cough*
<MakerDusk> dos is needed because it's an operating aside
*weeping_pegasi82 is rocking out
<MakerDusk> meaning it can make changes to windows without windowsx
<Unnr> Hmm, but do you want to replace unix with YetAnotherUnixBasedSystem?
<soulrider95> Phase4: are all my games working on steam? with the same performance? I think not.
<MakerDusk> that's probably lost on most of you
<soulrider95> * on linux
<Tassadork> ShizuKlaus: it never changed much. they were going to overhaul the whole thing in vista, but cancelled powershell before it came out IIRC
<Phase4> Unnr, thats just it, i can't see that working :(
<MakerDusk> tech idiots
<gdlk_ouo> linux actuall have a good support, but not enterprise support
<ShizuKlaus> 13powershell... concerned me...
<CrystalPhoenix> whatever happened to that PONY os?
<Unnr> gdlk_ouo: What about dead rat enterprise support?
<ShizuKlaus> 13linux doesn't make me use shift unless a file is case sensitive :P
*EngagedLuna 07,01is a bit surprised to see so many ponies on IRC during x-mas
<EngagedLuna> 07,01I call MAGIC
<Phase4> powershell is what happens when you try to make a shell script as powerfull as a full programing language
<weeping_pegasi82> Pi is exactly 3!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh fuck Linux
<jcelios> EngagedLuna: and rambling about tech stuff also XD
<Tassadork> was there a pony marathon or something around christmas?
<Phase4> it confuses those who want a programing language and alienates those that want a shell
<Unnr> Luna, its christmas Eve for the US, barely 1 am in the East Coast
<rdash> EngagedLuna: so many people because they can't sleep, too excited ;)
<weeping_pegasi82> hm, nopony noticed
<gdlk_ouo> Unnr well redhat is exception that you can have commercial product based on linux
<DerpyMuffins> We're all here to see you EngagedLuna
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], ?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> East Coast Bronies /)
<Ninjazz> I just go nothing better to do actually.
<Ninjazz> got*
<gdlk_ouo> but i think their enterprise even worst then microsoft :D
<weeping_pegasi82> woo I am successfully INVISIBLE!
<soulrider95> Phase4: until linux has support for SLI, physx, and ALL of my games to run with close to the same performance, I will NOT change from windows.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The only shit I'm getting is you can learn crap faster and edit files better
<CrystalPhoenix> I've spent my christmas eve playing Bayonetta
<gdlk_ouo> enterprise support*
<jcelios> weeping_pegasi82: OMG STFU PI ISNT DAT
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> THATS ALL I SEE
<CrystalPhoenix> best christmas ever
<Unnr> weeping_pegasi82: But if you are invisible, then you can come and EAT US ALL
<weeping_pegasi82> jcelios: Ah know :P
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> alright, I'm off to play some TF2, merry xmas everrpony, and congrats again Luna
<texasboykc09> night everypony
<weeping_pegasi82> Unnr: yes, yes I could
<Phase4> soulrider95, SLI was introduced with nvidia driver.... 180? cant remember, physx predated windows suport, better cuda suport, and opengl has a lot less overhead than direct x
<Unnr> soulrider95: Then ask Nvidia nicely to not be *explicative deleted* to the linux dev community
<weeping_pegasi82> bye pala- dude!
<soulrider95> Phase4: i know the technology is there, but because consoles, most games are still built on directX
<EngagedLuna> 07,01thank you, merry christmas to you too
<Phase4> soulrider95, litterally only microsoft uses directX
<Phase4> no one else wants it
<Phase4> it's shit
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Good old pc eliteism
<Tassadork> didn't valve find that openGL ran 30% faster or something, on linux?
<ShizuKlaus> 13merry merry!
<soulrider95> Phase4: but guess what 90% of my steam library runs on.
<weeping_pegasi82> sheesh you think he would wait for people to say goodbye to him!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> MY OS is better! No mine is! Fuck you all
<Phase4> Tassadork, yeah
<ShizuKlaus> 13Tassadork: afaik it always does, it's just that the code to make it do so is a bit fugly compared to directx
<ShizuKlaus> 13which is why everyone still uses directx
<Phase4> soulrider95, yes, and 90% of desktop computers run windows, doesn't exactly make it good
<Tassadork> anyone going to try steam for linux when that hits?
*weeping_pegasi82 reinforces bunker and then blasts pony music
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8cJ4kQSOnA&list=PLpwxB8U_3wksmLl9cSfemLkHcd4h5KoVJ
<Unnr> Tassadork: its already in open beta
<Tassadork> I used steam under OSX... briefly. it wasn't too impressive
<ShizuKlaus> 13next time i mess with takara i'll throw the linux steam on, doubt that can run headless though
<soulrider95> Phase4: I never said that because there is more, it is good. I'm just trying to say since almost all of my games run on directX, I'll use the OS that supports it the best.
<Phase4> ShizuKlaus, the biggest reasons behind directX being used are courses still teach DX and opengl suport on windows is appuling
<Phase4> some machines just don't have it
<Phase4> particular ati driver doesnt even install it right
<weeping_pegasi82> what makes a good villian?
<weeping_pegasi82> what makes a bad hero?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> ShizuKlaus: Not to be an asshole but the way you talk about linux is implying that Linux is better than anything is what I'm getting
<weeping_pegasi82> what makes a funny character?
<ShizuKlaus> 13SpadeKyurem[WoW]: no, there are just some things it does faaar better than windows
<Unnr> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Pshaw, everypony knows that Amiga is best.
<DerpyMuffins> So much Techy talk
<Tassadork> something zen for you to listen to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UZBE8duru0&list=PL3D37B8DA9D8F4B0D&index=14
<Phase4> theres very little windows does better
<thelonecubone> http://i.imgur.com/dpoJl.png
<soulrider95> Phase4: I'm not here to support the better company, or the better OS, I'm just here to play games.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Im pretty sure Windows can do some stuff Linux cant do
<Tassadork> Unnr: amigaOS represent =P
<DerpyMuffins> My head hurts
<weeping_pegasi82> oops there goes my strange mind again!
<Unnr> Tassadork: /)
<Phase4> and the things it does better are polish, not a technical advantage
<ShizuKlaus> 13windows has the application base
<Tassadork> (\
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What do you mean polish?
<ShizuKlaus> 13shiny
<ShizuKlaus> 13eye candy, UI, etc
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> <.<
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh
<Phase4> soulrider95, fair enough, and i still use windows for games (AND ONLY GAMES), but linux is just that much more useful
<Phase4> linux has better eye candy
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So the only stuff its better at is attaraction
<ShizuKlaus> 13much of linux still lives on text because for many things that's all you need
<gdlk_ouo> guys guys, acutally consoles are true evil :D If you talking about graphics on pc
*Phase4 <3 compiz
<gdlk_ouo> and microsoft behind zem
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I dont care about appeal I want something that can run games good enough
<DerpyMuffins> Phase4 why not just make a new OS with the best of Linux and Windows?
<Deacon> nerry christmas whoever's on, how are y'all?
<weeping_pegasi82> ANYPONY WANT M&MS?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Derpy_Hooves: Winux?
<soulrider95> Phase4: I have ubuntu on my OS drive, and on days I dont game I boot to that, but since if I'm on a computer, I'm gaming, I just have windows the default.
<gdlk_ouo> Phase4 you like tearing with compiz?
<Ponies47> Well it's Christmas were I live so . Merry Bucking Christmas
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins, i've thought of doing that, but getting it to work on the same range of hardware as linux would be insanely complicated
<gdlk_ouo> then i use it last it was terrible
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0oV3jid-0c&list=PLpwxB8U_3wksmLl9cSfemLkHcd4h5KoVJ
<Tassadork> DerpyMuffins: yeah... but the best parts about linux are the things that make it really hard to sell for money...
<ShizuKlaus> 13as far as games go windows is still king, but hopefully steam for linux will push Wine to close the gap faster
<Phase4> gdlk_ouo, i don't get tearing
<Phase4> gdlk_ouo, nvidia card? their driver HATES compiz
<weeping_pegasi82> no? Oh well more for me then! :3
<gdlk_ouo> Phase4, yeah nvidia
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Safari is worst OS
<Phase4> as soon as i got an intel card instead of a nvidia, all the crashes stopped
<Phase4> like all bugs all gone
<soulrider95> ShizuKlaus: Wine is shit. complete shit. We need native linux stuff, not wine trying (and failing) to emulate windows.
<DerpyMuffins> Phase4 I see, so you need the hardware to back up the software?
<Unnr> DerpyMuffins: Look at the history of ReactOS
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The fuck is Wine?
<ShizuKlaus> 13like i said
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Never heard of it
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], >safari
<Phase4> >os
<thelonecubone> weeping_pegasi82: i want M&M's ;3;
<ShizuKlaus> 13hopefully steam for linux will push them to get notcrap
<gdlk_ouo> intel drivers native
<Phase4> you must be new here
<gdlk_ouo> in x11
<gdlk_ouo> as i know
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: Look I forgot the OS for Macs, macs are shit anyway
*weeping_pegasi82 gives M&Ms to thelonecubone
<Tassadork> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: wine is an emulation layer, lets you run windows programs in linux/mac osx. sort of
<Phase4> OSX
<ShizuKlaus> 13osx, a distant relative of one of the BSDs iirc
*thelonecubone noms on the M&M's :3
<Phase4> and i'd have more of an opinion on OSX if it was possible to use the bloody things
<ShizuKlaus> 13so it inherits POSIX standards
<Phase4> ShizuKlaus, not too distant, uses the March kernel
<ShizuKlaus> 13where does Darwin figure in
<ShizuKlaus> 13was that the previous kernel or..
<Unnr> Wine = WINdowsEmulator (Well started off that name, but now stands for Wine Is Not an Emulator)
*Kipkat07_Scarf parachutes into the chat, drunk
<Phase4> set of services ontop of March
<Phase4> March is a microkernel
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So when does streaming resume?
<ShizuKlaus> 13aha
<Tassadork> ShizuKlaus: darwin is the bsd core under OSX, it's the only major open source part of it
*weeping_pegasi82 stuffs face with M&Ms
<Phase4> i belive GNU Hurd uses March as well
<ShizuKlaus> 13Unnr: gotta love recursive acronyms
<Phase4> or a march derivitive
<ShizuKlaus> 13GNU's Not Unix, Wine Is Not an Emulator
<gdlk_ouo> http://intellinuxgraphics.org/ i remember can't find driver here for my laptop
<Tassadork> Phase4: osx is actually pretty nice. you get most of the nice unixy stuff, and a stable os. the only problem is... you can only get it from apple...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4UTKk5eF1c&list=PL9FB1A5DC948DD70B&index=50
<ShizuKlaus> 13there's one in the "Yet Another" category i think
<gdlk_ouo> not perfect support though
<Phase4> Tassadork, yeah, it looks like it'd be the perfect os, except for apple
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I drank 5 shots of Jack Daniels in 7.53 seconds no chaser and no vomiting. First Time drinking. GET. AT. MY. LEVEL.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Plus I think Macs cant run games that well
<Deacon> SpadeKyurem[WoW] gotta say, one of my fav tracks from the game
<Tassadork> actually Wine means Wine Is Not and Emulator =P
<Unnr> ShizuKlaus: KDE Desktop Enviroment
<Deacon> next to virbank and humilau of course
<weeping_pegasi82> I HAVE FAILED CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF THE CHAT
<Unnr> YAML - YAML Ain´t Markup Language (originally Yet Another Markup Language)
<weeping_pegasi82> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<Tassadork> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: sure they do. dual boot into windoze =P
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Am I wrong to say Macs are kind of shit?
<soulrider95> Phase4: Also, until linux is a lot easier for the non-poweruser to work with, it won't gain much traction.
<weeping_pegasi82> oh well, BACK TO MUSIC!
<Tassadork> which is what I have been doing to play games all week
<Phase4> soulrider95, ubuntu
<Kipkat07_Scarf> whats everypony talkin bout
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Peanuts
<Deacon> no idea
<thelonecubone> Kipkat07_Scarf: stuff
<weeping_pegasi82> Kipkat07_Scarf: techy... stuff
<Tassadork> Kipkat07_Scarf: computarz
<Phase4> soulrider95, though it is not the most stable linux out there, needs a little work
<thelonecubone> and hi Deacon and Kipkat07_Scarf :)
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Wait... is this an OS conversation?
<BluestromS> hello
<Kipkat07_Scarf> OMG
<soulrider95> Phase4: still, some stuff is beyond what we can expect of the average computer user.
<Phase4> Kipkat07_Scarf, yes, it is
<Phase4> soulrider95, try install it in a vm :P
<Unnr> ShizuKlaus: But the best one has to be the Hurd
<Phase4> its trivial
<Deacon> hiyo thelonecubone
<thelonecubone> brb, gonna open some gifts :3
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Phase4: I LOVE OS CONVERSATIONS
<Phase4> litterally click next to continue install, even sets up windows dual booting for you
<ShizuKlaus> 13oh gimp too i think, GIMP IMage Processor
<Unnr> Hurd - Hird of Unix-Replacing Daemons (Hird = Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth)
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Imo Black and white and 2 have the best Elite 4 theme evar
<ShizuKlaus> 13oh lol
<Tassadork> GIMP = GNU Image Manipulation Program

<Deacon> Ford = Found on Road Dead
<soulrider95> Phase4: I have it on my main computer, I know it is EASY to use, but until it is EASY and SEAMLESS, the majority of users will stick with other OS's
<Phase4> soulrider95, you don't want seamless, windows has a crap ui
<Phase4> terribly slow and any kind of multitasking involves painful manual window managment
<soulrider95> Phase4: All I mean is, if the average user has to open terminal at all, the OS has failed the average user.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Phase4: what do you think about Win8?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: OH GOD THE HORRO
<Phase4> soulrider95, you don't have to touch a terminal
<Tassadork> soulrider95: agreed. most people just aren't up for that
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> *horror
<DerpyMuffins> You'd be rich if you could ship Windows and Linux Phase4
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins, i'm suddenly imagining windows X linux fanfics
*soulrider95 Phase4: I did just to get a proper version of flash player working. Just for flash player
<Phase4> my brain kinda cuts out there
<Kipkat07_Scarf> DerpyMuffins: they tried that. Called Winux. TERRIBLE.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Windows management works fucking fine to me
<Phase4> soulrider95, uh, you do that from the software center
<Phase4> don't need to open a terminal
<Phase4> theres just far too many guides out there that are outdated
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> terminal?
<Phase4> :(
<Tassadork> actually, whenever I get around to upgrading to a new machine, my plan is to run a bunch of linuxes in virtual machines under windows, or something like that ...
<soulrider95> Phase4: but the software center doesnt work even close to 100% of the time.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: God forbid trying to work shit out yourself
<Phase4> soulrider95, odd, i've never had any problems
<ShizuKlaus> 13software center is just a frontend for aptitude isn't it
<Phase4> yeah
<Unnr> Phase4: To be fair, ReactOS has tried to do native windows emulation. but well, yeah
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOtWjPKc1IU&list=PL9FB1A5DC948DD70B Remix!
<Phase4> Unnr, it's got a LONG way to go
<Unnr> Phase4: True story that.
<soulrider95> Phase4: It will install flash, yes, but if you want a proper, updated version, good luck.
<Holiday_Xephos> merry christmas everypony
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], how many things do you run at once?
<Tassadork> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: why are they all 30 minutes long!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Can we just say every OS has its advantages
<Phase4> cause for simple tings alt+tab is more than enough
<soulrider95> Phase4: not some bootleg version of the windows API.
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], NO :<
<Deacon> happy pagan holiday to you too Holiday_Xephos!
<ShizuKlaus> 13WAR!
<ShizuKlaus> 13HUH!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: like what? Tabs? Programs?
<Phase4> soulrider95, o_O
<ShizuKlaus> 13WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR!
<Phase4> soulrider95, the flash linux port is a native port
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: money. thats it.
<Unnr> ShizuKlaus: Determing those still alive?
<soulrider95> Phase4: oh no it isn't. Not even close.
<Phase4> uh... yes it is
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> IE IS BEST BROWSER
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> :P
<DerpyMuffins> FLAME WAR
<ShizuKlaus> 13HEATHEN
<Seyzen> I think the fire is broken.. I don't feel warm at all :(
<Phase4> soulrider95, i don't know what you're doing but i've got native 64bit flash installed RIGHT NOW
<Phase4> it works
<Phase4> works quite well
<Kipkat07_Scarf> So whats everypony's view on Windows 8?
<Phase4> Kipkat07_Scarf, EVIL
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: What did you mean by how many things I run at once? Tabs and programs?
<soulrider95> Phase4: it says it is native, it works fine, but if you go and check the files, its basically running on a emulation
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], tasks, how many different things will you be attempting?
<Unnr> remember, windows is posix compliant >_<
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Phase4: Good, I was worried I was the only one who thinks that way.
<DerpyMuffins> Kipkat07_Scarf go bury Windows 8 in a hole somewhere
<Kipkat07_Scarf> '
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: Most of the time I just have Chrome and or WoW up
<Tassadork> Kipkat07_Scarf: it's been painful for me. the desktop is nice, everything and anything related to metro is annoying. just give me win7 =P
<Deacon> is win 8 that bad?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Thats about it
<Phase4> Unnr, interix is the worst unix intergration i've ever seen
<Phase4> and i've seen one
<ShizuKlaus> 13wasn't lindows supposed to be a middle ground between linux and windows?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Deacon: I doubt it, people always over react
<Phase4> because everything else is unix based
<Deacon> New EqD Post: NOTHING!
<soulrider95> Windows 8 isnt that bad. I've been running it for about 3 months now, and it works just fine.
<Phase4> Deacon, try it
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Lindows sounds retarded
<ShizuKlaus> 13there's another one i forget that changes the filesystem standard to be closer to windows too
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4 is just a Linux purist
*Kipkat07_Scarf lights windows 8 on fire and kicks it into a hole of abyssness and eternity
<Phase4> it yanks you betwene metro and the desktop so often
<ShizuKlaus> 13or was it haiku that's the windows clone
<soulrider95> Phase4: then you are using it wrong
<Phase4> soulrider95, how could i be using it wrong?
<ShizuKlaus> 13there's some linux flavor that wants to be a straight windows clone
<DerpyMuffins> How did this start......
<Phase4> i'm doing simple things like, i don't know, windows update?
<Phase4> notepad?
<Phase4> browser?
<Tassadork> soulrider95: yeah, win8 works, and with enough hotkeys you can get around all of the stuff that's annoying to access, but it's definitely not an improvement over 7
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Could any of you linux users not sound arogent when talking about WIndows?
<DerpyMuffins> ....
<Tassadork> for example... after using win8 for 3 months, I finally learned where they put the control panel
<Holiday_Xephos> oh hey i just looked at the time and it is 12:13 so it is, officaliy where i am, Christmas
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], i've used windows quite a bit, so i can complain and not be a hypocrite
<soulrider95> Phase4: just find the option to boot everything to desktop by default, use metro interface as a better start menu, ????, profit
<Kipkat07_Scarf> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: http://i.techrepublic.com.com/blogs/arrogant_linux.jpg
<Phase4> soulrider95, it's not a better start menu
<Kipkat07_Scarf> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Nuff said.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WHo gives a shit about a start menu
<soulrider95> Phase4: well that is opinions, so....
<Phase4> soulrider95, thing is the mouse is slow, keyboards are fast. in windows 7 theres a search bar in the start menu
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Saying one thing is better is a matter of opinion
<Phase4> from that search bar i can start many different things
<Holiday_Xephos> well i have to go so soon
<Phase4> best thing in windows imho
<Holiday_Xephos> so goodbye
<soulrider95> Phase4: same thing is in windows 8....... same functionality is there.
<Phase4> windows 8 has it
<Phase4> BUT
<Phase4> it 'catagorizes' results
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> WHO CARES
<Deacon> SpadeKyurem[WoW] people love arguing over details it seems
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> SO?Q
<soulrider95> or you know, turn the categorizing off
<Phase4> and requires you to select with the mouse
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Minor fucking details!
<Phase4> soulrider95, how the heck would i do that?
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], ITS THE MINOR THINGS THAT MATTER :<
<soulrider95> like stop QQ'ing about the new stuff, and spend I dont know, 30 minutes checking out the options?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: Oh god! MOVING THE MOUSE! NOT THAT?!
<DerpyMuffins> This has been going on for the last hour or two
<DerpyMuffins> I have a headache
<Unnr> Hem hem.
<Phase4> DerpyMuffins, ikr! its great
<Deacon> DerpyMuffins that long? wow, even more than the political debates here
<Unnr> Methinks we need some Yule Tide fun!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Im really trying to not be an asshole here but this is retarded
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], mice are slow, very slow, theres tasks that require them and everything through the keyboard is silly, but windows shoves far to much onto the moue
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Phase4: I told my mom to get me a new keyboard/mouse combo and she gets me a fucking windows keyboard/mouse that wont run when I use linux and the keys are placed oddly so that my pinky has to press enter instead of my ring finger
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: All you seem to be doing is complaining about minor fucking details that could easily be fixed
*EngagedLuna 07,01tried metro and got confused
<DerpyMuffins> ^
*EngagedLuna 07,01laughs softly
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> My mouse is pretty fast
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], then why are'nt they fixed
<soulrider95> Seriously, anyone who thinks windows 8 is complete shit has obviously not even spent 5 minutes checking options.
*Unnr presents: The Snowman, Irn Bru edition: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yZOab5gl-4
<Phase4> soulrider95, i can't turn off metro, and i dislike metro
<ShizuKlaus> 13it's not complete shit, but they've dropped the ball almost as bad as vista
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I use vista
<Tassadork> ShizuKlaus: ^
<EngagedLuna> 07,01nothing beats millenium though <3
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I have no issues with it
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], you are a silly person
<EngagedLuna> 07,01Windows millenium
<Phase4> EngagedLuna, XD
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I dont see why Vista is so fucking bad
<DerpyMuffins> And here we go again....
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I really dont
<soulrider95> Phase4: Then turn everything to desktop mode, don't even use metro 99% of the time.
<Tassadork> Unnr: I think you just made my christmas
<ShizuKlaus> 13vista was doomed by driver manufacturers and stabilized afterward, win8 is starting out of the gate with horrible press because of metro
<ShizuKlaus> 13windows ME :P
<Tassadork> Unnr: I loved this cartoon when I was a kid
<EngagedLuna> 07,01yes shizu
<Deacon> SpadeKyurem[WoW] it's something about memory issues with vista
<EngagedLuna> 07,01the horror!
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], slow, bloated, released far too soon, terrible colour scheme
<Unnr> Tassadork: <3 both that advert and the original
<MahBoi777> MERRY CHRISTMAS
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: I dont know..CHANGE THE COLOR?!
<ShizuKlaus> 13i think i used it once, but i'd been on win98 til then and i was like 10 so it was "oo shiny new i don't know what any of this is"
<Unnr> The Snowman is such a great holiday special
<Tassadork> OMG he drops the kid
<SantaTheDuck> Merry Christmas to you too MahBoi777 :P
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: I has vista. I havent used other distros of windows though besides 98 and XP but those were so long back that I dont remember any of it.
<Deacon> lali-ho MahBoi777, happy christmas to ya too!
<MahBoi777> ^.^
<ShizuKlaus> 13i have fond memories of 98, only managed to crash it a few times in the many many years i used it
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], i'll give you that but the other critisizms are valid
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> FUCKING WINDOWS 98!
<soulrider95> IMHO, the improvents windows 8 has behind the scenes far outweighs the drawbacks
<soulrider95> *improvements
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also I love how people call an OS crap for ONE THING
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], oh no, i hate windows for many other reasons
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: Vista crashed a few days ago for me :'( first time. I was so scared I almost fell out of my seat.
<ShizuKlaus> 13XP was okay but they shouldn't have gone with the fischer price UI, Vista tried changing a lot at once and got kneecapped by drivers out of the gate
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Phase4: me too
<soulrider95> Phase4: what other reasons?
<Phase4> i can start listing the various problems i've had but that take many hours
<Deacon> SpadeKyurem[WoW] well same thing could be said for other things
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You do realize that Not every OS is perfect
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Phase4: I hate microsoft in general
<ShizuKlaus> 13win8's trying to bridge desktops and touchscreens and the press is almost unanimous that it's failing at both
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Even your fucking Linux
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So shut the hell up
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], Linux is a kernel, and i have my complaints about it as well, but windows is so terribly screwed up in so many ways
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> But the way you say it its like LIinux is fucking perfect
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: Exactly. I'm doing a report on OS history and Im saying how Windows is trying to bridge the gap
<Phase4> it's not perfect, no software is, but it's a damned lot closer than windows
<Deacon> opinions man, they blow everything out of proportions SpadeKyurem[WoW]
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Again matter of opinion
<ShizuKlaus> 13remember, all software has bugs
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> OPINIONS ON THE INTERNET?! FUCK THAT
<Unnr> ShizuKlaus: except that encoded in LOL memory
<Phase4> no, not matter of opinion, there are a variety of technical reasons why it is better
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Rule of the internet if you dont like things how I do, you're wrong
<Unnr> <3 LOL memory
<Phase4> windows is never chosen because its a 'better' opperating system
<Phase4> it's chosen for buisness and/or suport reasons
<ShizuKlaus> 13this is reminding me of the time i got zlined from an irc network because their lead ircop was a diehard microsoft fan and refused to acknowledge where linux has strengths
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Phase4: Its more well known
<Phase4> or for the average user, because it's what was on the computer when they bought it
<Deacon> plus it's the one everyone knows, but it seems like apple is takeing over that
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Again fucking remind me what Linux has over windows besides fucking polish
<ShizuKlaus> 13well.. it's lighter
<soulrider95> Phase4: which means it is better in that area, because it supports SO MANY established software, drivers, etc.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> ShizuKlaus: And....
<DerpyMuffins> Cya everypony, and congratulations EngagedLuna
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Phase4: That too... Im getting a laptop for christmas and Im going to rage if it has Win8 on it. Ill still be greatful but Ill rage inside.
<Sylandest> laters Derpy_Hooves
<Sylandest> damn
<Sylandest> DerpyMuffins:
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Kipkat07_Scarf: Suck it up wuss
<Unnr> G´night DerpyMuffins
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], faster, more stable, hardware suport is sometimes better though a little flakey, more actively developed, better installation frameworks
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Fucking deal with it
<DerpyMuffins> Really a tab fail now?
<Phase4> like it has a package manager
<ShizuKlaus> 13windows server 2008 r2 takes up 1 out of 2GB RAM on my laptop, just from booting up the very first time
<Deacon> seeya DerpyMuffins, have a happy new year (soon)
<soulrider95> ShizuKlaus: by the time I got everything running like I wanted it to, the resource usage was only a tinsy bit less than windows
<DerpyMuffins> 163
<VenHur> Gotta' go for the night. Happy holidays.
<SantaTheDuck> Bye DerpyMuffins
<ShizuKlaus> 13ubuntu server with a full web stack is taking up 100MB
<Kipkat07_Scarf> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Im gettig Linux on it first thing?
<Deacon> laters VenHur
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], plus its UI is far more customizable than windows
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> It angers me you make Linux sound so fucking flawless
<Phase4> you can completely change its behaviour should you want to
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: I installed Ubuntu throught wubi and it took up about zero hard disk space
<ShizuKlaus> 13*technically* windows has a package manager in the form of MSIs but the one class where we examined how those work... i was scared off forever
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Phase4: Well maybe not everyone wants to do that!
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], it's hardly flawless, somewhat fragmented api, various incompatible ui librarys, and a lack of UI polish
<ShizuKlaus> 13wubi does something weird afaik, i've never dualbooted
<Deacon> SpadeKyurem[WoW] tough luck kid, but you could always try for yourself when given the chance
<Unnr> ShizuKlaus: They scare me as well. Not sure if they or RPMs are scarier
<Phase4> but these are much more minor than window's problems
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], and you don't HAVE to change the UI
<Phase4> but the option is vital for any advanced user
<soulrider95> Phase4: remember, the average user far outnumbers super-users, and linux is just NOT friendly to inexperienced users. You can't argue that linux is more newbie friendly, and if you try, you are just being ignorant
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Who cares...
<Phase4> i do
<ShizuKlaus> 13MSI, if you want to make an installer, you must first have a windows with no software installed
<Phase4> as does a bunch of other people
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> What Im getting is Linux is for people who know computer programming
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: Dual booting gives me such a good feeling. It's awesome to turn the computer on and have the choice of running Windows or Linux
<ShizuKlaus> 13actually that and the installation process... learning that windows discs generally have all editions ready to go and it's the key that selects...
<Tassadork> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: anyone can learn to use linux, but it definitely is a nicer choice for programming, and science compute stuff too
<Kipkat07_Scarf> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Im teaching my 69 year old mother to use Linux
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Why?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> and shes never used computers
<Kipkat07_Scarf> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Because I can.
<ShizuKlaus> 13if you want to run a server in your house, you'd better run linux, it's extremely light compared to the best windows can do
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Why is she using a computer in the first place at that age?
<Unnr> Kipkat07_Scarf: My step-grandmom switched to linux herself after she got tired of windows crashing
<Deacon> SpadeKyurem[WoW] why not?
<GabeMoist> SpadeKyurem[WoW], because computers are useful for people of any age
<Kipkat07_Scarf> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: online banking, news, pron, etc.
<soulrider95> And all the people who hate windows for charging so much? Idiots. like "how DARE they try to make a profit?"
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], just to be here Linux is a kernel, it abstracts hardware for software, in this context though when i say linux i meen a linux distribution, of which there are many each with their own strengths
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I hate the excuses about Microsof tis after your money
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> EVERY COMPANY IS MORONS
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> SO SHUT UP
<Tassadork> soulrider95: change isn't necessarily bad... but with windows you're stuck with whatevever microsoft gives you. if they get it wrong, and they do now and then...
<Phase4> the one i use for example is for techincal users, you have to configure most of it yourself
<Phase4> ^
<ShizuKlaus> 13eh i've never thought of pirating windows, except the XP ISO i have which was strictly for the VM for ancient games
<Kimori> whats up?
<soulrider95> Tassadork: and linux or OSX doesnt do the same thing?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: If someone makes something that I want, they deserve my money. thats how I keep myself away from pirating.
<TheGentlemanBrony> So why exactly is the yule log using the youtube player?
<Tassadork> soulrider95: with linux, you can just change it back if you don't like it
<Phase4> soulrider95, components of a full linux desktop can be replaced, and are almost always open source and changeable anyway
<Tassadork> and I have actually been avoiding upgrading OSX, because I don't like some of the changes in 10.7 and 10.8
<Phase4> i can change window manages at runtime
<ShizuKlaus> 13Kipkat07_Scarf: well and for me the various hoops you usually have to jump through to prevent windows from learning it's pirated, too much hassle, i just stick with my OEMs or use one of the dozen or so server keys i have
<Deacon> so, besides the OS talk, what's been happening this x-mas eve/day?
<Tassadork> like how they dropped rosetta support, and diablo II won't run anymore =(
<soulrider95> Phase4: except you know, rolling back updates reduces security?
<Phase4> soulrider95, ?
<ShizuKlaus> 13TheGentlemanBrony: because we can, not worth the upstream bandwidth for any of us to be live this whole time
<Phase4> Deacon, not much for me
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: I want to start learning how to run servers but my computer is crap so Im building one from scratch that should be powerful enough to do servers
<soulrider95> Phase4: seriously? if you roll back updates, that means you lost ANY kind of security patch. And unless you spend time scouring the changelogs, and manually fixing the security holes, you have a insecure, easy to access system.
<thelonecubone> Deacon: Just got back, Got a shirt, A Sweater and some money from my Uncle, and you?
<ShizuKlaus> 13Kipkat07_Scarf: if you have an old one just use that, haruko's been running irc and a web stack on 256MB for four years now
<Deacon> thelonecubone oh not much, just usual work nd all
<Phase4> soulrider95, uh, usually not, often the larger things that would be security targets maintain multiple branches
<Deacon> nice for you though thelonecubone
<thelonecubone> Ah
<Phase4> soulrider95, if you want gnome 2 for example, that's still maintained
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Cant we all just get along and say every OS is special in it's own right? :(
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: Okay. Now all I need is to be taught how servers work and how to run them.
<soulrider95> Phase4: gnome is just a UI. I'm talking about kernel updates.
<CrystalPhoenix> Minty Twistmas everyone http://25.media.tumblr.com/640f36148efc37c31907c8b89d2f2117/tumblr_mfjyw7mDU01rvl3xdo1_1280.png
<ShizuKlaus> 13:P
<Unnr> <3 Minty
<Phase4> soulrider95, kernel abi is insanely stable so theres no real need to roll back updates
<Tassadork> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: what's wrong with talking about their relative merits?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Come on guys cant we all just get along?
<Deacon> CrystalPhoenix and now all we need is pink snow.....
<soulrider95> Phase4: but you were talking about feature changes you dont like, not stability.
<thelonecubone> CrystalPhoenix: Yay
<ShizuKlaus> 13weeell you start by picking a distro, debian is popular because it takes a long long time between updates making triple sure things are stable, ubuntu is debian with a wider set of community packages but upgrading servers can be a pain
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I wish I knew more about computers. I am going to be an IT worker
<ShizuKlaus> 13there's smaller distros out there i'm sure, redhat and fedora are big server distros still i think
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], we can
<Phase4> i don't see any of this as not getting along
<Deacon> just your little debating, that's all
<CrystalPhoenix> It begins http://24.media.tumblr.com/39f1d3d52c17c8ac98f6dcf40cee794b/tumblr_mfkggx4GPa1s1v2zgo1_500.jpg
<ShizuKlaus> 13outside of a corporate environment i wouldn't recommend windows server except to replace windows on a laptop, slightly less bloat in exchange for quirky compatibility elsewhere
<Phase4> SpadeKyurem[WoW], i'm not going to try stop you using windows, or even dislike you for it, i just disagree with it
<soulrider95> Phase4: how good software is, is only 40% of the story. IT is two things, technology, and business. Even if the technology is better somewhere else, if the customer does not need/want it, then the new technology was a waste of time developing.
<Deacon> CrystalPhoenix huzzah for greedy selfish people -_-;
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: what would I need a server for?
<CrystalPhoenix> Deacon, that's the main reason I do not like Christmas
<thelonecubone> CrystalPhoenix: Greedy Kids these days :I
<GabeMoist> Kipkat07_Scarf, stuff
<ShizuKlaus> 13well serving web pages is fun, lets you tinker with stuff and then see it in a more realistic environment
<CrystalPhoenix> a lot of people seem to miss the whole point of it all
<Phase4> soulrider95, i'm still figuring how buisness and software should interact
<ShizuKlaus> 13irssi+screen+putty is still the best irc client setup on the planet
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JUCfX1P1ik IT BEGINS!
<soulrider95> Phase4: business and software rely on each other.
<Unnr> Smashing! http://i.imgur.com/ybUZD.jpg
<ShizuKlaus> 13depending on how much cpu and ram you have to work with, you could always run minecraft :3
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: so I could serve a computer game that I create?
<ShizuKlaus> 13that too
<Kipkat07_Scarf> This intrigues me...
<ShizuKlaus> 13a basic web stack, nginx+php+mysql, opens up a lot of things you can play with
<Unnr> ShizuKlaus: Have you seen the telnet nyancat?
<ShizuKlaus> 13apache's still good too but it's a much bigger thing, tends to be a hog when you don't have as much memory to work with
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: How many languages can you code in?
<ShizuKlaus> 13telnet nyancat?
<Sylandest> derp
<ShizuKlaus> 13i know of towel.blinkenlights
<soulrider95> Phase4: they are all connected, E.G.: networking as a college major, started in the BUSINESS colleges. because networking is there to serve people the information they need whenever they need it. Not for technology, but for the PEOPLE.
<Unnr> ShizuKlaus: miku.acm.uiuc.edu
<ShizuKlaus> 13Kipkat07_Scarf: uh... technically... php, can pick up java again, did a little C but not enough to be useful, used to do autoit
<ShizuKlaus> 13wiremod expression 2 i think counts as lua partially
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: What do you reccomend a hardcore computer user should learn?
<ShizuKlaus> 13programmers get mad if you count html but it is still a language
<Phase4> soulrider95, yeah, i do get that
<Phase4> soulrider95, i ment in the context of software itself, not the use of, and how that should interact with buisness
<ShizuKlaus> 13people rag on php for the many security issues you can get yourself into, but honestly i find php fun
<Tassadork> Kipkat07_Scarf: hardcore? bahdunno, assembly? seriously, don't do that. but python is popular for people starting out, so is ruby
<Phase4> i hate php with a passion
<Unnr> Tassadork: What do you mean? Assembly is ´ossum
<ShizuKlaus> 13throw some code up and see it do stuff, i love rapid feedback
*Unnr learned to program in assembly x86
<Kipkat07_Scarf> hmmm.... assembly sounds fun...
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> NERD SPEAK
<ShizuKlaus> 13but then you get into real development, or god forbid wordpress plugins, and things start going to hell...
<Phase4> not for security reasons, thats an artifact of the culture more than the language (though php doesnt help), it's just terribly designed
<GabeMoist> Unnr, that sounds very much unfun
<ShizuKlaus> 13phase would know more about that, my foray into "real" php dev stopped with our embed switcher
<ShizuKlaus> 13Kipkat07_Scarf: do you have garry's mod?
<Phase4> i know far too much about php
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: I dont has moneys so no
<ShizuKlaus> 13oh
<soulrider95> Phase4: simple economics: Business has money, wants more. Develops new software to streamline their business. This makes more money, for more research into new technologies. software, OS's, etc. have to be useful to the majority, otherwise money will not be made and more software cannot be created.
<Unnr> GabeMoist: It actually has made my major much, much easier
<ShizuKlaus> 13maybe it'll go on sale this week
<ShizuKlaus> 13anyway
<ShizuKlaus> 13http://www1.idc.ac.il/tecs/plan.html < building that in gmod wiremod was a blast
<ShizuKlaus> 13takes you from basic logic gates up through a CPU and on to writing a language and its toolchain and an OS on top of that
<soulrider95> Well anyways, its 1:41 here so I better get so sleep. Gnight everyone
<Tassadork> I only ever touched php once, wrote half of a drupal plugin. drupal is super well organized and cuts around phps problems, but I've only ever read bad things about php in general
<Phase4> i want to impliment an ip like protocol in 6502 for redpower computers
<Unnr> niiight soulrider95
<ShizuKlaus> 13also i think i'm making hikari mad at me for wiping maps over and over
<ShizuKlaus> 13i should have thought to version my myst php code, but i didn't..
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: I rage at my school because I am referred to a computer nerd at my school but I cant even code. I FEEL SO INFERIOR COMPARED TO EVERYONE IN THE CHAT
<ShizuKlaus> 13Kipkat07_Scarf: fear not that feeling never goes away :3
<Tassadork> Kipkat07_Scarf: yeap. there's always a bigger fish =P
<ShizuKlaus> 13phase and saturn get into the finer details of caching and my eyes go wuuuuuuut
<otakon> Kipkat07_Scarf: then learn to code
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: joy. Im going to get some ice cream and grow out my neckbeard.
<ShizuKlaus> 13X3
<GabeMoist> I know the basics of programming, but I never go that far because I can never think of things to do with my programming
<Tassadork> Kipkat07_Scarf: you're on the right path
<GabeMoist> I'm terribly uncreative
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I actually do have the beginnings of a neckbeard XD
<ShizuKlaus> 13GabeMoist: much of my diary this year has been "i need a project!" :)
<GabeMoist> I did try to make an application in C#, but I couldn't seem to get the stupid GUI to update
<GabeMoist> So I'm stuck with that
<ShizuKlaus> 13i made some horrifying code in autoit once...
<Tassadork> yeah... it helps to have a job related to coding, provides incentive and lets you practice it all day
<Unnr> ShizuKlaus: Any good with java?
<Tassadork> but like any other hobby, if you want to get into it on your spare time, you can make things happen
<ShizuKlaus> 13used to be decent, forgotten a lot of it though
<Unnr> Darn.
<Sundaysmile> Oh hey, that's my screensaver for my TV!
<Sundaysmile> And Merry Xmas too all here
<ShizuKlaus> 13my GUI code in java was.... let's just say it should be zeroed out....
*Unnr has an android app in dev, and might be looking to get some java programmers on board
<Kipkat07_Scarf> my wonderful problem is that I have an inferiority complex and so I need to have a huge ego to compensate. Now I have to be better than phase and saturn at computers to balance myself out again
<GabeMoist> I was never good with Java GUIs
<GabeMoist> Then again, I was doing Java in Notepad...
<GabeMoist> that might be why
<Tassadork> Kipkat07_Scarf: bah forget about that. software is such a big field, you can learn your whole life and only scratch the surface
<ShizuKlaus> 13am not sure which is worse... inferiority complex, or impostor syndrome...
<Kipkat07_Scarf> 60 years later... *old Kip* I finally did it!! I am the best computer programmer in the world!!! *dies*
<ShizuKlaus> 13there was a thread on /r/learnprogramming a week or so ago, like an 85 year old guy said he started learning code, best thing he ever did
<EngagedLuna> 07,01Sundaysmile a merry x-mas to you too
<Sundaysmile> thanks man
<EngagedLuna> 07,01miss*
<ShizuKlaus> 13man?
<ShizuKlaus> 13:3
<Sundaysmile> how about dude?
<EngagedLuna> 07,01dudette
<Sundaysmile> gah
<GabeMoist> One thing I've been interested in lately is how people make game patches
<Tassadork> I hardly touched programming before university, half of the people I know were coding in high school or even younger... makes no difference
<Sundaysmile> niceladyperson
<EngagedLuna> 07,01that's better *smiles*
<Tassadork> GabeMoist: like, ROM patches?
<Ryunosuke> heh
<GabeMoist> Tassadork, I was thinking translation patches, actually
<Kipkat07_Scarf> My father was a computer programmer at HoneyWell and IBM. He worked on some of the first computers. *smug grin*
<ShizuKlaus> 13blaaah why are all of these seeds terrible.....
*Jmo slaps DashWithRainbows around a bit with a large trout
<Tassadork> GabeMoist: the little I've read about modifying emulated games makes it sound like the blackest of black magic. more hacking around than coding.
<Unnr> ShizuKlaus: Oooh, what did you find?
<Sundaysmile> because nobody seeds in 2012
<Sundaysmile> just wait until 2013
<ShizuKlaus> 13i think hikari is getting very annoyed with me starting a new world, having dynmap flood the CPU with rendering, then i kill the server and start over..
<ShizuKlaus> 13nice hilly redwoods biome... with a giant "mini jungle" behind it....
<Tassadork> GabeMoist: mostly involves loading the app into memory, searching for strings in the original langauge, swapping them out for ones in your destination language, dealing with obscure character encodings used on consoles...
<ShizuKlaus> 13i just want a good coast with a forest behind so i can put my house up and leave it this time...
<GabeMoist> Tassadork, I know that some involve using disassemblers like OllyDbg and stuff. I tried learning it, but never got to far
<ShizuKlaus> 13taking a good minute to boot up server with a fresh world... hard to test seeds with 50 worldgen mods loaded...
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FHTDnaYD-M
<bell> bye.
<MrBen> Merry Christmas, you guys!
<SantaTheDuck> Merry Christmas to you too MrBen
<MrBen> Just wanted to pop in and say that before I go to bed.
<MrBen> Later!
<ouo> Merry Christmas to you guys :)
<GabeMoist> Tassadork, but the big problem is that some games have the text files in these weird files. What needs to be done first is finding out how to extract the files somehoe
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pemeKEUiDXo
<Tassadork> yep! this is reverse engineering, something I don't know much about. there are applications called hex editors, that can be used to find chunks of text inside of binary files
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I liek binary
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I wrote an essay in binary and handed it to a teacher one day. Failed completely grade wise. Won epicly in my mind.
<ouo> i liek words, you should use it to speach text
<Tassadork> oh racist barn...
<Tassadork> how did this song make on air? that's a heck of a mondegreen
<Tassadork> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen
<GabeMoist> Tassadork, I know about disassemblers and hex editors, but using them to find out how to extract the files I need is another kind of black magic. But I did learn why the people who do the hacking are so rare though

<ShizuKlaus> 13also
<ShizuKlaus> 13we should totally install linux on our toilets
<ouo> Unnr, nope it's true
<Unnr> <3 toilet as a fileserver
<KrazyNoobs> Toilets that can store every move you make on a database?
<KrazyNoobs> I wonder what that can be used for...
<ouo> i should install linux on my imaginary girl to shut her imaginary mouth
<KrazyNoobs> Or maybe recognize a word, such as, "Flush", and perform the action?
<cachi01> ''eat poop''
<cachi01> ''drink piss''
<cachi01> ''watch millions of peoples asses''
<thelonecubone> and vomit?
<cachi01> oh yeah vomit
<cachi01> ouo: that would just make her more powerful
<Unnr> MIT had a dorm that had the bathroom attached to a sensor network so that you could check if the toilets were occupied
<Unnr> from your dorm room
<cachi01> going to sleep everypony :) goodnight and merry xmas!

<ShizuKlaus> 13oh clearly you all don't pay attention to my streams

<Ninjazz> Unnr, that I agree with.
<Moopy> Well ShizuKlaus i got the fire place on my screen here twice
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Yep, I know, but how is it related to the current topic?
<ShizuKlaus> 13good for you?
<Sabershy> Oh! you have a 3DS SuperChristmas64? Trade friend codes?

<Ninjazz> ShizuKlaus, sorry. Streams don't even work on this computer anymore so I don't even try.
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Alrighty then :D
<ShizuKlaus> 13i love how every bug complaint we've ever got amounts to "it broke what do"
<Sabershy> ShizuKlaus: If it makes you feel better, I have been watching this video for the past 24 hours or so.
<ShizuKlaus> 13no screenshots, no description, just "it broke"
<Sabershy> They n't want you to see theirporn tabs open.
<SantaTheDuck> Stream just brokeded, what do?
<Unnr> Sabershy: *snicker*
<SantaTheDuck> >.><.<
<Ninjazz> Not a complaint. Just streaming video can't match with the buffer.
<Malavolent> ShizuKlaus: What broke?
<ShizuKlaus> 13[02:30] [ Moopy] Well ShizuKlaus i got the fire place on my screen here twice
<Sabershy> only one I have is that the stream is about 15 secs behind the chat.
<Ninjazz> Oh.
<cowvarkian> that would matter more if it wasnt just fire
<ShizuKlaus> 13it's a fireplace loop
<ShizuKlaus> 13as for regular streams, the streamer is always well ahead because of delays in processing between source, provider, and you
<Moopy> Ij now your making me feel bad
<ShizuKlaus> 13lag beyond that is your own connection, nothing we can do
<SuperChristmas64> 11,02Sabershy: Sure :D gimme min :3

I met this guy offa 4chan and after he buys me a coffee at a late night cafe, we go back to his pad to smoke some ganj and drink some rum and coke. He had an Applejack hanging from his rearview in his car, so we had already passed the initial 'lol ponies' shit. Anyway. We're waiting for the vaporizer to heat up and he turns on My Little Pony. I fell in love with Rainbowdash and Fluttershy because
<DaringDerpy> :)

<DaringDerpy> Fluttershy because
<DaringDerpy> wait...don'T you see it yourself

<ouo> try it on e621 :3
<Simon> No presents for me, since I live in Asia
<fluffle> Wow, too much information
<fluffle> :'(
<Lil_B> Simon where in asia?
<Simon> Hong Kong
<Lil_B> wow
<ouo> Simon, same here bro, i live in russia, so new year is only date to celebrate
<Simon> Speaking of new year... I can receive red packets during the new year festival from my relatives, which contains money
<fluffle> Cash is the best gift of all :P
<Simon> Eh, I suppose
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> omg
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> i told my dad to give me vanilla coke juts now
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> and guesswhat
<Simon> juts?

<fluffle> Did he throw it at you
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> was in fridge and i didnt want to move
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> nope

<KrazyNoobs> After 80 minutes of work (I have so much spare time), i found out you cannot make art of Zalgo...
<cachi01> yes you can
<cachi01> well
<fluffle> That’s not the Christmas sprite
<cachi01> zalgo is just the thing that messes up with everyone

<cachi01> KrazyNoobs: exactly like that :)
<Simon> fluffle: you mean spirit?
<fluffle> opps
<fluffle> Whatever:P
<KrazyNoobs> I tried to draw a Fluttershy Yaying out of Zalgo, and, instead of turning out cute, it turned out creepy.
<Simon> sounds like the darker side of Fluttershy
<Simon> Mind showing it to us?
<KrazyNoobs> Zalgo is not allowed here, so I'll PM it to you.
<KrazyNoobs> Well, Zalgo is okay here if used minimally, but it is highly discouraged... rather avoid risking it.
<KrazyNoobs> On 4chan, Zalgo turns out good all the time, but IRC just messes it up to where you cannot make art with it
<Simon> The chat's extremely cold...
<Bronysith> TBF, it is christmas
<KrazyNoobs> Isn't there a fire right there?
<Bronysith> and im going to church in my phoenix wright cosplay
<Bronysith> minus the wig >.>
<KrazyNoobs> Simon: You just need to move closer to the fire
<cachi01> yay i bought amnesia, half life complete pack, portal and l4d2 =D
<ouo> and i'm back
<KrazyNoobs> wb ouo
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, just the formal part? Awesome.
<Bronysith> cachi01: be sure to play amnesia completely in the dark with surround sound headphones
<cachi01> wb ouo
<cachi01> Bronysith: of course!
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: indeed, ill take picutres and upload to deviantart
<ouo> thank you KrazyNoobs cachi01 :)
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: after church of course
<Bronysith> cachi01: enjoy, also, try and enjoy half life, cause people hyped it up to death
<Bronysith> T~T
<KrazyNoobs> ouo: It is just a habit for some of us to be extremely nice to one another... that is a thing here on BronyState
<Bronysith> not as good cachi01 , as people say
<cachi01> Bronysith: i like half life :) i've played it before
<Simon> I like Valve and Steam
<cachi01> but yeah its kinda overrated
<Bronysith> cachi01: ahh okay good, i like it, but i dont understand why people hype it to death
*KrazyNoobs needs a dispenser here
*Simon dispenses a dispenser
<Bronysith> Simon: as in , Simon the digger?
<ouo> KrazyNoobs and it's wonderful! :)
<cachi01> Bronysith: and half life 2 and its episodes, i have those for ps3
<cachi01> i bought them for the mods :3
<Simon> Simon the who?
*KrazyNoobs repetitively runs around the dispenser
*KrazyNoobs is a spy
*KrazyNoobs from the other team
*KrazyNoobs saps dispenser
*Simon notices that KrazyNoobs is spamming
<Kandarihu> After the guy who was designated as my Secret Santa gifted me Half Life 2 Episode 2 and nothing else, I went ahead and bought the Half Life Collection. Steam isn't giving me an extra HL2E2, though.
<Bronysith> Simon: ah, so you arent coolio simon the digger, just some guy named simon
<Bronysith> T~T
<Simon> Yes
*Bronysith suplexes Simon into EVA-02
<Bronysith> ooooh breakfast time
<cachi01> Kandarihu: lel
<KrazyNoobs> It's 12:14am here
