<Jim> Doctor who is happening
<DeadlyDerp3> They couldn't
<prince-dari> Hazard3: Have you met an advanced race of super beings?
<Meanwhile> They aren't exactly an advanced alien race of super beings. They're galactic parasites on a ship made of asteroid.
<unfoundbug> ah dr who
<Meanwhile> Hardly the Q continuum by any leap or bound.
<Hazard3> no and I highly doubt they would act like teenagers
<DeadlyDerp3> "no, I don't love him"
<prince-dari> Because I'd say compared with all other life that we know of we're an advanced race of super beings.
<Hazard3> EPIC SEX SCENE
<prince-dari> And we're all dumb as fuck most of the time.
<DeadlyDerp3> "Yes, we AGREE"
<Hazard3> lol

<DeadlyDerp3> I don't mind
<Gumri> The universe is bucked
<Meanwhile> Gumri: what a horrifying thought.
<DeadlyDerp3> Right now WE ARE the most intelligent species
<Hazard3> JASON!*bitch slap and keeps walking*
<Phase4> ohai [SWAG]thehated5689
<unfoundbug> is this actually dr who?
<Meanwhile> Yes.
<DeadlyDerp3> Nothing will change that till we find it
<Hazard3> because your smarter than them dumbasses
<DeadlyDerp3> "JASSOon, PRESS X TO JAAASOOON!!"
<Jim> How large the universe is, it's not unlikely that there are aliens out there, but who knows if they're smarter than us or not.
<DeadlyDerp3> Was that Nick Frost...?
<Hazard3> should be
<Hazard3> we were late
<Chocolate> too the roof
<Hazard3> then they start to jump off like on Dead Space

<GenesisIsMagic> Have you heard of the ps vita before?
<Jim> Well, even if there were an early race, they could have exterminated eachother, just look at nuclear weapons

<DeadlyDerp3> "nothing, we will just give up like PUSSIES"
<[SWAG]thehated5689> so what will kill us first? Aliens, Natural Disaster, or Each other?
<Randomnerd> Each other.
<WRITEity> well, it's safe to imagine that, if aliens have found a way to accomplish intergalactic travel in a feasible amount of time, that they are at least more technologically advanced than us.
<Hazard3> Im worried that they would be like a bunch of routey teenagers.
<Stallion_of_War> Aliens that cause us to destroy each other with natural disaters
<Hazard3> Leaveo ur planet!
<Stallion_of_War> or THE STALLION OF WAR

<Shizuka> 13acupuncture, because opening hundreds of tiny wounds is somehow good for you
<WRITEity> well then you'd know needls in the ass are very very relaxing.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so is this video is the new Pinkiequest
<MahBoi777> needles are not magic
<MelaPonie> Shizuka, not hundreds
<WRITEity> just a few dozen
<MelaPonie> Shizuka, at least not for any treatment i'm aware of, is normally 15-30ish
<derpy_pony> sounds like fun
<MahBoi777> I would pop
<WRITEity> also, MFW people use "fear of needles" as a reason not to get a tattoo. IT'S NOT EVEN A REAL SYRINGE.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Setting something else up, gimme min
<Shizuka> 13you are injecting foreign particles into your SKIN
<LadyCanary> Still, I've heard it hurts terribly.
<MahBoi777> 60, 59, 58, 57, 56
<WRITEity> LadyCanary: tattoos or acupuncture?
<LadyCanary> Tattoos.
<Shizuka> 13sb should lrn2testcard
<MahBoi777> what's your name?? tattoo...
<WRITEity> LadyCanary: depends on the artist. Some have such a light touch you barely feel them, others had such a heavy hand it feels like the ink is gonna bleed through the other side of your body.
<WRITEity> really the best thing to do when getting a tattoo is to have some music or something playing on headphones, and try to zone out until the artist is done.
<Shizuka> 13tattoos, because when you want to make a decision that sticks with you forever, make it a misspelled slogan that won't be witty next year, much less decades down the line
<Ganon181> hi
<Dken2021> hi ho Ganon181
<WRITEity> Shizuka: that's the stupid ones. Others get tattoos that are extremely meaningful.
<Ingwaz> and make sure you pick a dragon that will end up looking like a unicorn 30 years later
<MahBoi777> ohai Ganon181
<WRITEity> for instance, my mom had the Tree of Life tattooed after she nearly died, to symbolize her zeal for life and what it has to offer.
<WRITEity> my aunt has her kids' names tattooed as a bracelet around her wrist.
<Ganon181> yo mah boi
<Genericblue> is anyone elses stream working
<LadyCanary> That's beautiful, WRITEity.
<derpy_pony> no stream here

<Shizuka> 13now ponies see why i put up the test card when swapping video sources
<Simon2> dat wii
<WRITEity> so yeah, a Tattoo isn't a decision to take lightly, but it can also be a very personal dedication to something important in your life.

<SuperBrony64> 10,02Wait, does Gordon Freeman even say anything in the game?
<Hirschhazel> What? nooo!
<Shizuka> 13but that's not all
<WRITEity> emangamer: eenope. She just had an AMAZING range.
<Shizuka> 13they also voiced alpha 1 in freespace :<
<Dken2021> voice actor could've done both male and female voices
<WRITEity> SuperBrony64: ...that's the joke.
<PartyCannon> SuperBrony64 nope
<Midnight_Tempest> SuperBrony64: nope
<RawketLawnchair> Males can do feminie voices, emangamer.
<Kencolt> I see a distinct lack of a stream... Oh, well...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Then how could his VA die if he never said anything?
<Ganon181> Doctor Freeman needed no lines, just a crowbar

<LadyCanary> ...
<LadyCanary> I like that.
<Kencolt> Well... it was Ed Wood's film he was most proud of. That says a LOT... he was-- honestly-- trying to make it a significant message film. Honestly.
<WRITEity> Ed Wood made a LOT of shitty films.
*MahBoi777 pokes Ganon181 with a turkey leg
<WRITEity> he was a Z Movie Messiah.
<Ganon181> wha?
<MahBoi777> DINNER.
<Kencolt> It does have the unique distinction of spawning Criswell's only "prophecy" to ever come true. "I predict that this is the film you will be remembered for."
<derpy_pony> the uwe boll of ancient movie making
<MasterBrony> well.....this brony is off to bed everypony.....ga'night.....

<derpy_pony> never seen it...no one wanted to play it on saturday
<Kencolt> The thing about Wood, is, well, yes there were a LOT of bad flicks. But Ed's were sincere. He wasn't trying to make a quick buck off teens at the drive-in making out. He was trying to make MOVIES. Serious, quality movies. He was just very very bad at it. And it shows... these are flicks that just somehow... you get it?
<Midnight_Tempest> chat... is ded...
<fillyfillyy> eeyujp
<fillyfillyy> eeyup**
<Dken2021> ...or is it?
<Midnight_Tempest> <_< >_>
<Kencolt> How do I put this... Plan Nine... You can watch it and enjoy. That movie just mentioned that never actually got shown and there was 90mmins of dead stream but no-one minded... well...

<Dken2021> most of the "movie" films are really bad
<Kencolt> Epic Movie does not exist. There is no such movie with that title. It was NEVER Shown, NEVER streamed. We enjoyed, happily, a 90minute blank stream. END OF DISCUSSION.
<RawketLawnchair> Midnight_Tempest: How horrifying.

<MahBoi777> srry if the link is too long
<Phase4> and now i have to turn the stream off, need the cpu power to compile firefox
<unfoundbug> cause a stream uses soo much cpu power :P
<Phase4> it does
<Phase4> pegs one of my cores
<Phase4> actualy laggs the chat, flashplayer only uses one core
<unfoundbug> i highly doubt that the firefox project actually supports multiple processor compilation
<Armageddon> ohai
<Phase4> it does
<MahBoi777> super silly cider squeezy
<Phase4> unfoundbug: its jumping betwene using two cores and one, doesnt suport it well but it does
<DeadpoolDash> he flies
<unfoundbug> you only on a dual core machine?
<Phase4> yup
<Phase4> next one will hopefully be a quad
*Phase4 laptop
<unfoundbug> your concerns make more sense now
<DeadpoolDash> 6 and 8 cores are on the way
<unfoundbug> yeah, on a quad now, new one in a few months should be an 8 core
<MahBoi777> DeadpoolDash: well he is a pegasus, lol
<DeadpoolDash> so he has a mod running then
<MahBoi777> think they said it's called creative mod
<unfoundbug> creative mode not mod
<unfoundbug> servers got the switch in a while ago
*RainbowcrashNBurn sneaks into chat and says "its creative mode"
*Phase4 spots Rainbow-Dash
<MahBoi777> yea, what they said

<Drake> 04You should use an APache
<Armageddon> apache?
<Drake> 04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_AH-64_Apache
<Drake> 04Apache
<Drake> 04F-22
*Drake searches
<Armageddon> Drake
<Armageddon> honestly
<Armageddon> I think we should create entirely new models
<Drake> 04surewhynot]
<Armageddon> because remember this is 2069
<Drake> 04True
<dashiee> milk!
<Armageddon> we'll be past sixth generation models even
<Drake> 04But we'll have to base it off of current manufacturers
<Armageddon> probably 7th or 8th gen, whatever that is
<DeadpoolDash> cider
<Drake> 04Like Boeing, Lockheed etc.
<Armageddon> haha the Apache's nice
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> remember the next generation air dominance page I showed you?
<Drake> 04oooooh
<Drake> 04Yes I do
<MahBoi777> root beer
<Drake> 04The F-22 looks badass
<DeadpoolDash> its like superbrony is some sort of magical creature
<Armageddon> yeah
<MahBoi777> he created a lake
<Armageddon> it's one of the best jets of 2011
<dashiee> lets go swim
<Armageddon> we should draw concept art
<Armageddon> uh
<Armageddon> *you and Xeli should
<MahBoi777> he's a wizard!
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Drawing machines is difficult
<Drake> 04But if it's just sketches
<Drake> 04then it should be fine
<Drake> 04Don't expect any blueprints >|
<Armageddon> no blueprints

<dashiee> hi simon2
<DainbowRash> Hey Simon2
<Simon2> SuperBrony64: you sp or mp?
<DeadpoolDash> there should be a water bomb to fill that hole
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Mp

<MahBoi777> i know right? seems like a lot of work just to fill it up
<Armageddon> I prefer the raptor Drake

<Drake> 04I personally prefer this

<Armageddon> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_generation_jet_fighter
<Drake> 04But then it's your choice
<Armageddon> Yeah I showed you that one yesterday
<Armageddon> they look similar
<Drake> 04I know
<Armageddon> I'll probably redesign it
<Drake> 04I'll*
<Drake> 04:)
<Armageddon> what?
<Drake> 04Unless you want to draw it
<MahBoi777> wish I had a bucket of infinite water, that'd be sweeeeet
<Krakass> Yeah but if you accidentally tipped it over it'd be hell to clean up.
<unfoundbug> would make a really good hydroelectric plant thoguh
<MahBoi777> both good points, infinite power
<Drake> 04Meaning
<Drake> 04I thought I was drawing the designs
<Drake> 04I'd obviously take directions from you
<Sumica> 00,10MahBoi777 you should look in to the technic pack then
<Armageddon> I won't draw it Drake
<Armageddon> I'll probably make a nice little scribble
<Armageddon> let you do the rest
<Armageddon> and describe it
<MahBoi777> I'm good, I don't play Minecraft anymore
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04alright
<Drake> 04But if it's your design you'll still need to tell me what to do

<Espeon|School> You two
<TOY_PON3> Oh night Sumica
<Espeon|School> ~
<MahBoi777> thot u fell asleep, lol
*TOY_PON3 appears out of nowhere
<Drake> 04Heya Xeli
*Drake hugs
*Espeon|School hugs both
<Espeon|School> somehow
*RainbowcrashNBurn is startled by TOY_PON3 suddenly appearing

*Armageddon hugs
<Armageddon> Drake
<TOY_PON3> :P
<Armageddon> "The new fighter is to perform strike, air superiority, close air support, precision bombing and reconnaissance roles, as well as incorporate direct energy weapons"

<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3
<Drake> 04DUN
<Drake> 04DUN
<Drake> 04DUUUUUUUUUUN
<Simon2> lol
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: Yes?
<Drake> 04Lasers
<Rainbowjack> what LVl are you?
<Espeon|School> direct energy weapons what does this imply
<Espeon|School> and of course pewpew
<Drake> 04I'll accept them here because it's a plane
<MahBoi777> just pingin ya for the heck of it, lol
<Drake> 04But I imagine a straight beam, rather than the Star Wars autocannon lasers
<Armageddon> yeah but I wasn't expecting that
<TOY_PON3> Lol
<Armageddon> probably
<Armageddon> it'd takeup a shitload of energy
<Espeon|School> limited use time then
<Armageddon> yeah
<Espeon|School> BAM balanced
<Armageddon> well it'd probably be used in short shots
<Armageddon> rather than long beams
<Armageddon> also the beam would have to weaken with distance
<Armageddon> so that balances it out
<Drake> 04And in fact
<dashiee> !!!
<RainbowcrashNBurn> !
<Drake> 04The beam probably WOULD cause an explosion
<dashiee> out of nowhere
<Drake> 04not simply slice through whatever it's shooting at
*Drake looks for the article
<TOY_PON3> Umm
<MahBoi777> uhh
<Rainbowjack> everypony i need to go
<unfoundbug> cya Rainbowjack
<Krakass> See ya Rainbowjack
<DainbowRash> Bye Rainbowjack
<MahBoi777> bye Rainbowjack
*Rainbowjack hugs everypony
<Armageddon> yeah
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Bye Rainbowjack
<TOY_PON3> Later Rainbowjack
<dashiee> simion2 : you startled me
<MahBoi777> hi DainboRash, lol
<Drake> 04http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams
<Drake> 04It's TVTropes but it's accurate
<Drake> 04It has some useful notes on lasers as military weapons
<DainbowRash> Heya :)
<Krakass> Anyone need a 55 gallon barrel of personal lubricant? http://derpy.me/XLumR
<Armageddon> well lasers would definitely just cause a small dent
<Armageddon> or similar
<Rainbowjack> i will be back but mutch later going over to a friends place
<Armageddon> knock out stabilizers and such
<MahBoi777> accidently spelled ur name wrong:P
<Espeon|School> Well I imagine like
<Armageddon> unless it hits the engine
<Espeon|School> industrial lasers maybe on a little bit of steroids
<Armageddon> then it kabooms the engine
<Espeon|School> so it's not PEW through a big titanium block
<Armageddon> well
<unfoundbug> whut
<unfoundbug> seriously
<Rainbowjack> bye bye every pony
<Armageddon> using star wars as an example yet again
<Espeon|School> which is basically what you say
<unfoundbug> 55gallons
<Drake> 04Apparently lasers are generally meant to target explosive parts of the target
<MahBoi777> ?
<Armageddon> any of you seen a star wars laser hit something that's not a person?
<unfoundbug> couple of those and a waterslide would be epic
<Drake> 04so that it results in an explosion
<Armageddon> mostly aircraft
<Espeon|School> Logically because warmth.
<Drake> 04So using a laser on an aircraft and hitting the fuel tanks
<Drake> 04kaboom
<Espeon|School> And I don't get why lasers explode on impact in so many sci-fi movies anyway
<Armageddon> causes a minor explosion depending on the size/distance/etc.
<Armageddon> yeah
<Krakass> Indeed
<unfoundbug> even comes with a pump
<MahBoi777> definitely
<Armageddon> if you hit the engines etc.
<Armageddon> knocks it out
<Drake> 04Which means that lasers, if the energy and time it takes to fire them is somehow reduced, then they're actually pretty effective
<Drake> 04Especially against aircraft with defenses against missiles, like heat/IR flares
<RainbowcrashNBurn> lol at the product description, certainly being honest
<Armageddon> normally if you hit the wing or similar you'd knock out the stabilizers
<unfoundbug> and suddenly the chat was quiet
<Espeon|School> so basically a precise, virtually unavoidable (lol speed of light) disabling utility thing
<Espeon|School> makes sense
<MahBoi777> big adult party? lol
<Armageddon> it'd be pretty fucking overpowered if it;s a beam
<Drake> 04It'd be more
<Drake> 04A single strike weapon
<Drake> 04A split second of intense hear
<Drake> 04heat
<Armageddon> still
<Drake> 04To knock out stabilisers, as NS said, or the fuel tanks.

<unfoundbug> I'm a particle physics PhD working at CERN, on the Large Hadron Collider. We try to keep all 27 kilometers tunnels as slippery as possible at all times, on the theory that if the hadrons are already going close to lightspeed, maybe that will help push them over the edge. We make sure they're always going downhill, too, and we use fans to give them a boost. The fans dry out the lube some, which is why I can only give it 4 stars, b

<unfoundbug> its not that bad
<RainbowcrashNBurn> im looking at the review now....surely most of these are jokes?
<unfoundbug> unless you REALLY mod it
<unfoundbug> must be
<Armageddon> still
<Krakass> No kidding, I've wasted like 2 hours just watching
<unfoundbug> "Who in their right mind would try to stop 10 lubricated angry gorillas from stealing stuff? "
<Armageddon> they're should be lasers by 2069
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Minecraft <3
<MahBoi777> DeadpoolDash: people build some awesome stuff in Minecraft
<Armageddon> there
<RainbowcrashNBurn> im reading the "sliding back into the game" review atm
<Armageddon> fffs
<Drake> 04Just not constant laser weaponry
<Drake> 04Like BEAM SPAM
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> Rhy's energy daggers are fine
<DeadpoolDash> I know
<MahBoi777> lol lubricated angry gorillas:D
<Armageddon> due to having a physical object as a base
<Drake> 04A few lasers to intercept missiles or as quick-fire weaponry
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Who's streaming?
<DeadpoolDash> I am just scared of my creative side coming out and ruling me
<Espeon|School> Sounds more like plasma tbh
<Espeon|School> with the thing at the base
<Espeon|School> but anyway imagination etc
<Drake> 04A few plasma weapons, as long as they're practical
<Drake> 04A sword in a gun setting isn't practical at all
<RainbowcrashNBurn> :D "i experianced the heat thing when i had an adventurous incident with a toaster"
<unfoundbug> you got to the "no instructions" review yet, by far my favorite
<Espeon|School> A sword is pretty unwieldy anyway so it's good it's daggers.
<MahBoi777> I got tired of it after a loooong while
<Armageddon> a sword is only unwieldy if you swing it
<Armageddon> or it's one of those heavy ones
<Drake> 04http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyRabbitRomanceIsForKids
<Drake> 04Against guns?
<MahBoi777> not saying minecraft is bad, it's good, just gets kinda repetitive after awhile like most other games
<Drake> 04It's still impractical
<RainbowcrashNBurn> im on the awkward lube first date atm
<Espeon|School> daggers are a good compromise
<unfoundbug> out of context we sound crazy
<Espeon|School> and yeah I guess there are things more wieldy than like
<Espeon|School> claymore swords and such lol
<Drake> 04Because no guard is gonna wield a plasma sword when they've got an assault rifle that reaches infinity times the distance
<MahBoi777> crazy is good
<Drake> 04AND is easier to use. That's why swords have fallen into disuse
<Armageddon> but they require aim
<Armageddon> and aiming sucks
<Drake> 04Only for you
*Drake runs
<Armageddon> Besides
<Drake> 04That's why guards receive training
<Drake> 04To get better at aiming
<Armageddon> at close range swords are far more potent
<Drake> 04Of course
<Drake> 04But with guns you can take down foes before they get close
<Armageddon> if you're fast enough that is
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> once they're close
<Armageddon> you're screwed
<Drake> 04Of course the enemy will get close sometimes
<Drake> 04Like by surprise
<RainbowcrashNBurn> unfoundbug: i just read the no instructions one, you're right, its hilarious :D
<Drake> 04But that's why soldiers have combat knives
<unfoundbug> i can just imagine that actually happening which is quite worrying
<MahBoi777> dat lube
<Armageddon> and that's why Rhy will kick their ass
<Armageddon> and make them go crying to mummy
<Armageddon> or kill them before that
<RainbowcrashNBurn> im reading the one beneath it...its turned into fire escaping, and tripping over "1 of 37 pet muskrats"
<unfoundbug> o.0 the prison one
<Drake> 04XD
<MahBoi777> >.>
<MahBoi777> <.<
<unfoundbug> damnit, must work
<RainbowcrashNBurn> >.<
*Armageddon hugs Drake
*Drake hugs back
<MahBoi777> well, time to hit the ol dusty trail, night guys, take it easy.
*Espeon|School hugs both
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Night!
<unfoundbug> night MahBoi777
*Armageddon hugs Xeli too
<Armageddon> HUGFEST, I CHOOSE YOU
<RainbowcrashNBurn> goodnight MahBoi777
<Krakass> Ciao MahBoi777
*Drake gets frisky
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Who is streaming?
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> Anyway Drake
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Me
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:3
<Armageddon> I think we should name the aircraft
<DaniilScit|DWARF> SB ^^
<Armageddon> of course, I suspect we'll have our heli blown up several times
<Armageddon> so we'll cycle through names on that
<Armageddon> Rhy needs one for her jet
<Armageddon> though
<Drake> 04Her jet will never be destroyed
<Drake> 04Maybe at the end in the climactic battle
<Drake> 04But I dunno
<Drake> 04The jet is so cool
<Drake> 04It's basically her signature item.
<Armageddon> probably at the end
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> but name
<Armageddon> that's what I'm saying
<Drake> 04http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2119
<Drake> 04hurr lucky bitch
<Drake> 04Well
<Armageddon> I used to think "Storm Rider" but hurr
<Armageddon> that's just lame
<Drake> 04Storm Rider
<Drake> 04no
<Armageddon> we could go with something like "Raptor", "Thunderbird", etc.
<Drake> 04"Black Fury"
<Drake> 04or
<Drake> 04"<insert colour here> Fury"
<RainbowcrashNBurn> minecraft boats.....how do they work?
<Armageddon> eh
<Armageddon> "Night Fury"
<Armageddon> no
<Armageddon> anyway
<Armageddon> eh
<Drake> 04XD
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Minecraft water
<Drake> 04"Phantom Storm?"
<Armageddon> lame
<Armageddon> try one word stuff
<Armageddon> doesn't need to be 2 words
<Drake> 04I keep getting the idea that Rhy would come in with the jet, bombard the ground targets/air targets, and disappear
<unfoundbug> and minecraft walls
<Drake> 04"Skyscraper"
<Drake> 04Holy shit that's a cool name for a jet
*Drake takes note of that
<Armageddon> hm
<Armageddon> not bad
<RaveBrony> Top of the morning everypony! :)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Ohai RaveBrony :D
<unfoundbug> Mmorning
<RainbowcrashNBurn> Good morning RaveBrony
<RaveBrony> Hi :$ are you streaming SuperBrony64?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yup ^_^
<RaveBrony> Awesome! I need to get this game... :D
<Drake> 04"Viper"
<Drake> 04"Nightingale"
<Drake> 04"Gladiator"
<Armageddon> ...
<Armageddon> fuck no
<Armageddon> Nightingale is okay but that's a bloody singsong bird
<Armageddon> the other 2 are gay as shit, Drake
<Drake> 04I still like "Skyscraper" because everytime I imagine a plane flying and water vapor trails from the wing I imagine it literally scraping the sky
<Armageddon> yeah I know Drake
<Armageddon> Skyscraper could work
<Armageddon> Drake, Nighthawk/Skyhawk?
<Drake> 04Eh
<Drake> 04Maybe
<Drake> 04I prefer to go with more metaphorical names, but again it's your plane
<Drake> 04Skyhawk is just redundant
<Drake> 04Nighthawk could work
<OneTrickPony> hey everypony can I get the schedule for movie night?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hey, check the home page
<RaveBrony> ^
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But, here, let me link you the latest newsletter
<OneTrickPony> k
<Armageddon> What about bird names?
<OneTrickPony> thnx
<Drake> 04If you don't use Skyscraper I'm totally using it for something else
<Armageddon> like Falcon, Eagle, etc.
<RaveBrony> Im going bowling with some pals after school today, hope i dont miss it! >.<
<Armageddon> heh
<SuperBrony64> 10,02We're having a special schedule on Saturday.
<Armageddon> well, I like Skyscraper
<RaveBrony> O.o
<OneTrickPony> oh damn I wont be here
<Armageddon> just thinking of other things and then comparing
<Armageddon> Phantom Hawk would be suitable
<Armageddon> shortened to hawk
<Armageddon> since bird of prey + phantom for the same reason you stated before
<SuperBrony64> 10,02http://i.imgur.com/rqUNd.png
<OneTrickPony> on Saturday night and Morning but not in the day
<Armageddon> but eh
<Drake> 04I keep thinking "Phantasmagoria" but I just want to legitimately use that words
<pony1> what time is it in america?
<Armageddon> what
<SuperBrony64> 10,02In PST it is 3:02 AM
<SuperBrony64> 10,02In EST it is 6:02 AM
<Drake> 04http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/phantasmagoria
<RaveBrony> Babble with Bronies? What is this? O.O
<OneTrickPony> hmm Top Secret
<Armageddon> nah
<OneTrickPony> lol
<Armageddon> Nighthawk or Skyscraper at this point
<Armageddon> design would probably be grey/silver to black
<OneTrickPony> oh I have a great idea for a movie...Police Academy 2
<Armageddon> depending on what we'll be using it for
<pony1> woah is 10pm here on friday night :D
<Armageddon> (pink flowery and rainbow)
<Armageddon> nope.avi
<dashiee> now red
<Drake> 04The colour of the jet doesn't matter as long as it's grey/black really, because then at night time it's easier
<Drake> 04to stay in stealth
<Armageddon> I still like Raptor
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Babble with Bronies is a podcast that does interviews with bronies.
<RaveBrony> Its 6AM here O.o
<RaveBrony> :o
<Drake> 04In daytime it doesn't matter what colour it is. It'll still be seen.
<OneTrickPony> it's 3 here
<RaveBrony> Sweet! lol
<Armageddon> Skyraider?
<Drake> 04NS Raptor means Theif
<Drake> 04Skyraptor?
<dashiee> 2:04 pm friday
<Armageddon> Rhy is a sort of thief
<Armageddon> maybe
<RaveBrony> Strange :P
<pony1> ha ha still ahead of all of you
<Drake> 04But the plane isn't
<Krakass> See ya'll tonight, I'm off to work.

<Drake> 04Nice
<Armageddon> since that one should last us the longest time
<RaveBrony> Yay, people are starting to awaken xD
<Armageddon> and then it dies after a few years or so
<Armageddon> or something
<Drake> 04Then the second and third Skysabre and whateverelse

<Armageddon> nah
<Armageddon> that's not for helis
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Can you give me IP of server?

<Armageddon> or something lame
<Drake> 04hurr
<Drake> 04Then it dies real quick
<Armageddon> Commando 1

<Armageddon> stratolancer?
<Simon2> lol horse
<Armageddon> or cirrolancer
<Espeon|School> huh
<Armageddon> or nimbolancer
<Armageddon> lmao
<Espeon|School> that's somehow related to clouds what is this
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Nimbuslancer?
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> Sure Drake
<Drake> 04Nimbo makes me think of a whore
<Armageddon> ._.
<Armageddon> well
<Drake> 04Becase bimbo
*Drake headdesks
<Armageddon> nimbus clouds normally grow into cumulonimbus
<Armageddon> or nimboculumus
<Armageddon> whichever was the storm cloud one
*Armageddon can't remember
<OneTrickPony> im just gonna leave this here: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7MYHcQY47eA/TzRPYlz9t1I/AAAAAAAAeRs/n7dO-EfDcsA/s1600/my_little_sister_animated_by_rlyoff-d4p3km9.gif
<Drake> 04Cumulancer
<Drake> 04giggity
<unfoundbug> d'awwwwwwwww
<Armageddon> nah
<Armageddon> stratolancer
<Drake> 04Stratosphere
<Armageddon> no
<Drake> 04It wasn't a name
<Drake> 04I was figuring out the etymology of the name
<Armageddon> Stratus clouds
<Drake> 04Ah
<Drake> 04I prefer Numbuslancer
<Armageddon> I studied clouds in my free time in year 5/6
<Drake> 04Nimbuslancer*
<Armageddon> Nimbus
<Armageddon> it's a bit long
<Armageddon> sounds like 2 words
<Drake> 04Stratoslancer
<Drake> 04I prefer the s in there
<Armageddon> I don't
<Drake> 04But again, your choice
<Armageddon> well
<Armageddon> it's our decision
<Drake> 04Stratolancer then
<Drake> 04Not really
<Armageddon> what do you think, Xeli?
<Armageddon> yes it is
<Drake> 04I want to keep our individual items our personal choice rather than a group decision, unless it's stupid
<Armageddon> still
<Drake> 04Like a 5 clip rocket launcher as the signature weapon
*Armageddon slaps Espeon|Away
<Armageddon> er
*Armageddon slaps Espeon|School
<Armageddon> OH
<Armageddon> Ghostlancer, Drake
<Drake> 04Oooooh
<Espeon|School> o.o
<Armageddon> how's that, Drake?
<Armageddon> or just Banshee even
<Drake> 04http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=uVkIzSKUG_0#t=65s
<KasBot> Youtube video: 6Uploader: RadiantRhapsody 6Duration:5 0:02:47
<Drake> 04That's an awesome name
<Espeon|School> what are you
<Espeon|School> slapping me for
<Armageddon> naming our helicopter
<Drake> 04To get your attention
<Armageddon> or at least the 3rd one
<Drake> 04Our third helicopter
<OneTrickPony> alrighty everypony it is early i'm gonna get some sleep see ya on Friday stream
<Drake> 04So the first is an Apache
<Drake> 04Are we gonna change models each helicopter?
<RaveBrony> Cya OneTrickPon!
<RaveBrony> *OneTrickPony
<Armageddon> well
<RaveBrony> Take care!
<Espeon|School> uuuh
<Armageddon> Rhy's gonna modify each one like fuck
<Phase4> later OneTrickPony
<Espeon|School> I have no idea you 2 are better at names
<Armageddon> except for the commando
<Armageddon> though she'll still do it a little
<Drake> 04Well, alright
<Armageddon> I say the heli gets destroyed at the last mission
<Armageddon> though that means Nathan and Leo have no transport
<Kipkat07> hi everpony
<Phase4> ohai Kipkat07
<Phase4> i thought the chat broke for a minute there
<Drake> 04ground vehicle they steal?
<Kipkat07> MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Armageddon> nowhere near as fast
<Armageddon> or they could steal another heli
<Armageddon> but that defeats the entire point of having ours blown up
<Armageddon> I mean
<Drake> 04Who says they travel fast?
<Drake> 04Rhy might have to wait for them, or they might not travel very far.
<Armageddon> if Rhy used the jet at a slow speed on low altitudes
<Armageddon> they probably would be able to hang on
<Armageddon> or maybe we can create a cargo space in the jet
<Kipkat07> 12 HOURS 30 MINUTES TILL FRIDAY STREAN
<DainbowRash> Eeyup.
<Drake> 04I like the idea that they get split from Rhy and they have to travel via vehicle to a meeting place not far from a city
<Armageddon> mmhm
<Armageddon> or at the very least
<Armageddon> Rhy provides cover fire
<Armageddon> or leads the aerial enemies away
<RaveBrony> Indeed :P
<Drake> 04yeah
<Drake> 04But it's not as if they're being actively huntefd
<Drake> 04hunted
<Drake> 04It'd be in the middle of a warzone with the Mercenary Company told to shoot on sight, with the US/Russia/China/Japan armies converging or something.
<unfoundbug> !cd
<Tom> Episode 17 of season 2 "Hearts and Hooves Day" airs in 1 days, 3 hours, 57 minutes, 0 seconds (Feb 11 2012 15:30:00 GMT)
<Armageddon> And everyone else is still shoot on site
<Armageddon> sight
<unfoundbug> thats scary
<unfoundbug> not dari
<Armageddon> ffs
<Armageddon> mind's not working
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Yeah
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Haha,i had watch EP17
<Armageddon> either that or Rhy's forced to leave the Skyscraper somewhere
<Armageddon> and in the sequel/future/whatever
<Drake> 04She's gonna keep it one way or another
<Armageddon> she comes back and uses it again
<Drake> 04yeah
<Armageddon> saviour!
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> that'd be epic actually
<Armageddon> and it'd make more sense
<Drake> 04Yeah
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Have ag good sleep
<Armageddon> let's do that
<DainbowRash> Night SB
<Drake> 04:D
<Armageddon> she'll be bitchy about it for a while
<Armageddon> but that means we'll need to give her a new jet
<Armageddon> in the sequel
<Armageddon> like the Skyscraper II
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Thanks everypony for tuning in, I'm off to bed. Night ^_^
<Drake> 04I'd assume that by the end of the story Nathan doesn't have the preference against killing he once did, so using his .50 cal isn't out of the question
<Drake> 04Not really
<Drake> 04Maybe she just finds where she left it?
<Armageddon> or Skyraptor/Skylancer/Skyraider
<Drake> 04And like
<Armageddon> well she'll definitely find it where she leaves it
<Armageddon> I intend for that
<Drake> 04Nathan and Leo are pinned down, and Rhy pulls a Big Damn Heroes with the recovered Skyscraper
<Armageddon> but still
<Armageddon> it'll be in the far future
<Armageddon> or somewhat in the future
<Armageddon> and yes
<Armageddon> XD
<Armageddon> that'd be awesome
<Drake> 04There's no hope left...
<Drake> 04Then...
<Drake> 04*whistling sound, slowly rising*
<Drake> 04KABLAM
<Armageddon> xD
<RaveBrony> Good night SuperBrony64!
<RaveBrony> Thanks for streaming! :)
<Armageddon> well anyway
<Armageddon> we need to make a plot
<Armageddon> so
<Armageddon> how do we start out?
<Phase4> night SuperBrony64|Zzz
<Drake> 04I would figure that it starts from Rhy and Nathan being friends, close family friends
<Drake> 04Their two families go for an outing and have a car accident or something where they are the only survivors
<Armageddon> lame
<Drake> 04Then, they're both kidnapped by the company who has had their eye on them for some time, but couldn't just take them because of their family.
<Armageddon> that's magic
<Armageddon> aka unrealistic
<Drake> 04well then
<Armageddon> probably shouldn't know each other
<Drake> 04I just don't want us to have anything to come back to
<Drake> 04Like
<Drake> 04Neither of them have any family left, so they basically go along with the company because there's nothing else to do
<Armageddon> Rhy could kill her parents
*Armageddon hides
<Armageddon> okay no
<Armageddon> but
<Armageddon> I think Leo should probably start in
<Armageddon> and be all disdainful of Rhy and Nathan
<Armageddon> when they join
<Drake> 04Yeah
<Drake> 04I imagine he'd be in the company for a few years before Rhy and Nathan
<Armageddon> yeah
<Espeon|School> Sounds good
<Drake> 04Because he's the professional and all
<Armageddon> and yeah
<Armageddon> and the cold dude
<Armageddon> but yeah
<Armageddon> I'd imagine that Rhy and Nathan would be in similar places
<Armageddon> when the kidnapping occurs
<Armageddon> perhaps a bomb blast at a zoo or similar
<Drake> 04TERRORISTS
<Drake> 04or
<Armageddon> but they don't previously know each other until they meet on the transport
<Drake> 04maybe the mercenary company had been hired for a job
<Armageddon> and then shoved into teams
<Armageddon> Leo should be there
<Drake> 04they get caught in the crossfire
<Armageddon> yeah basically
<Armageddon> that's why I said zoo
<Drake> 04And their parents/family dies and they're forced to work for them
<Armageddon> he should grab us and be like "you're coming with me, kiddos"
<Drake> 04surewhynot
<Mikami> ARMAGEDDON
<Mikami> DRAKE
<Espeon|School> ohdear
<Espeon|School> People
<Mikami> You're both in my fucking story
<Mikami> get names or you're Drake Cockgobbler or Armageddon Dickmongler
<Mikami> and
<Drake> 04XD
<Mikami> drake get name
<DainbowRash> Yay! Slice of Life!
<Armageddon> lmao
<Armageddon> Mikami, just call us Nathan Hallmark and Rhy Feng
<Armageddon> :D
<Mikami> sounds good to me
<Armageddon> Anyway Drake
<Armageddon> :p
<Armageddon> anyway
<Mikami> wait >rhy
<Drake> 04aye?
<Mikami> penis or no penis
<Armageddon> ?
<Armageddon> Female
<Mikami> sounds good to me
<Drake> 04no penis
<Espeon|School> lack of psychic rapecats. And we've been through this, Armageddon should never have a penis.
<Espeon|School> It would be bad for everyone
<Armageddon> ):
<Drake> 04yes
<Drake> 04indeed
<Armageddon> you just spoiled my lifelong dream
<Armageddon> anyway
<Armageddon> Drake
<Armageddon> I say bomb at the zoo
<Mikami> so we have this now
<Mikami> Generation III
<Mikami> Base for Septem: Kazesho Ikezawa
<Mikami> Kazesho Ikezawa // Zanacross Redcloak // Uyen/? // Dirge // Vruet/? // Nathan Hallmark // Rhy Feng
<Armageddon> or bomb at the airport
<Mikami> perfect!
<Armageddon> or CAR BOMB
<Drake> 04airport
<Drake> 04bombing a zoo doesn't make much sense
<Drake> 04or a car bomb is good too
<Armageddon> car bomb would be too coincidental
<Espeon|School> airport makes the most sense as a target
<Armageddon> though so is airport
<Armageddon> and yeah
<Armageddon> airport
<Armageddon> I'm going to antartica and Drake is going to the artic
<Armageddon> 8D
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> ok no
<Armageddon> since my name implies I'm semi-chinese
<Armageddon> I'll be going to china
<Armageddon> Drake will be going to the US
<Armageddon> both from Australia
<Mikami> but there is no china! ;o;
<Armageddon> since Drake's name sounds american
<Armageddon> this is a diff story Majin XD
<Mikami> well then
<Drake> 04XD
<Mikami> I'M GONNA SPAM TF WITH NONSENSE ABOUT MINE
<Mikami> actually i explained the entire plot before

<Armageddon> anyway Drake
<Armageddon> so airport
<Armageddon> we line up
<Drake> 04airport
<Drake> 04then kaboom
<Armageddon> waiting at the register
<Armageddon> then
<Armageddon> kaboom
<Armageddon> yeah
<Armageddon> then dust etc.
<Armageddon> we find out parents/family are dead, scream
<Armageddon> Rhy survives because she lags behind her family
<Armageddon> Nathan survives because he's in the loo
<Armageddon> but then there's toilet bombs
<Armageddon> anyway
<Armageddon> Leo picks me up first
<Armageddon> because I'm unconscious
<Drake> 04XD
<Armageddon> then he finds Nathan in the loo
<Armageddon> and at that point I'm back awake
<Armageddon> and then he's like
<Armageddon> "you're coming with me, kiddos"
<Simon2> chat is ded
<Armageddon> I'd say that Leo's 18 at the beginning of the fic
<Armageddon> and Nathan and Rhy are 12-13
<Armageddon> or younger
<Drake> 04no
<Drake> 04way
<Armageddon> this is the prologue
<Drake> 04I wanted them to be 15 at least
<Drake> 04Well
