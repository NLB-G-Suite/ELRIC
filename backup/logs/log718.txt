<Sumica> 00,10as you can see much older posters
<AJIsAwesome> I honestly couldn't get into DK64.
<AJIsAwesome> I can understand why people liked it, but it just didn't really appeal to me.
<Ninjazz> I liked the game with the bongos.
<Ninjazz> Because I get to hit bongos.
<Gold_Demona> I love Banjo Kazzooie, but I've never been able to keep my interest in it all the way through the game

<oni_link> Oh yeah this part hahaha
<Gold_Demona> dat chopsticks
<Flyboy> hewl yeah!
<Jake> just regular slapstick
<killerpony7733> This song
<MadSurge> This brings me back, I had a long special for Bugs' 25 years on VHS and it was one of the first things I saw as a kid
<Kencolt> Animation, at this time, was made for everyone... the idea was to have a short that would "buffer" the two main features. (Almost evry evening in most movie palaces was a double feature, unless it was a "intended" huge blockbuster.)
<MadSurge> Look ma, no hands!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Was it the Bugs Bunyn Road Runner Movie?
<killerpony7733> Sumica hey mind showing the who framed roger rabbit scene with this song?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: no, it was a clip show with tons of his cartoons
<Sumica> 00,10not sure if it's on you tube.
<killerpony7733> Sumica I believe it is
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That's what the Bugs Bunny Road Runner Movie was. :D
<killerpony7733> Sumica Yep found it.
<oni_link> Oh Bugs, you so silly :3
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> ^
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yes, but I bet there was no Mel Blanc in it

<Eli> Jake: ohhh right. i should watch out for that
<CrystalineShard> So what show is this?
<Everlasting_Joy> I was hoping to get out this semester, but no, there's more red tape to cut through :[
<AttackWithHugs> twilight_sprinkle, shut up it won't happen. Everything will go as planned.

<Everlasting_Joy> oni_link: Sort of, see, I'll have all the classes I need for my major after this semester. The college's requirement says I have to take other classes unrelated to my major just because they are at a certain level (higher level courses). In other words, after this semester, I'm just wasting time and money satisfying some stupid requiset of theirs.

<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: im not american
<p4ngya> Saturn: that's getting annoying
<CreativePumkinName> ugly betty?
<CrystalineShard> SIR I FIND THAT OFFENSIVE :)
<oni_link> Saturn: I liked it, sometimes I dont get us either

<Everlasting_Joy> oni_link: What's wrong, in the sense of your health, if I may ask.
<CreativePumkinName> is..this like a doctor who rippoff?
<CrystalineShard> no one got the referance?
*CrystalineShard is sad
<twilight_sprinkle> CreativePumkinName: you realize doctor who isnt even the first thing with time travel?
<Lil_B> They think like heavy weapons guy
<oni_link> Everlasting_Joy: Got a bum knee. Went out months ago and it was getting better until a couple of weeks ago when it gave out on me as I left work to go home
<twilight_sprinkle> why is it always a doctor who ripoff, as if its the first thing about time travel
<Unnr> CrystalineShard: were you trying to make a superhuman samurai syber-squad joke?
<CrystalineShard> twilight_sprinkle: because it's the first thing that comes to mind.
<Lil_B> will this Banana Peel be Chakovs Gun?
<CrystalineShard> Unnr: get's a cookie.
<twilight_sprinkle> CrystalineShard: only because people nowadays dont read enough classic sci-fi literature..
<Lil_B> ohei Unnr

<Everlasting_Joy> oni_link: Jeez, it sounds like more red tape than I am going through :(.
<oni_link> Everlasting_Joy: I guess, Im just gonna have to bite the bullet and hold out until they give me the greenlight :|
<CrystalineShard> Practicle problems
<CrystalineShard> XD
<Everlasting_Joy> oni_link: Still, doesn't mean it isn't a terrible situation.
<oni_link> Everlasting_Joy: Oh yeah, theres no doubt about that. Im just not going to complain as much.
<CrystalineShard> so this is MIB
<CrystalineShard> :/
<oni_link> ha
<twilight_sprinkle> this seems more lik-yeah, what CrystalineShard said
<Everlasting_Joy> oni_link: Good attitude.
<Everlasting_Joy> "That's 2 dollars."
<oni_link> Everlasting_Joy: part of growing up i guess. i learned that bickering solves nothing. :P
<Everlasting_Joy> oni_link: Doesn't mean venting isn't healthy.
<Unnr> But ya gotta know the territory
<Everlasting_Joy> What I meant to say is, venting can be a good thing.
<oni_link> Everlasting_Joy: Oh yeah I have outlets for that though. I sit down and listen to music, work on making my own or play some shooting games hehe
<Everlasting_Joy> oni_link: :).
<twilight_sprinkle> lul such irony
<twilight_sprinkle> ermahgerd that art
<CrystalineShard> I used to vent in fighting games till they started making me more fustrated.
<oni_link> CrystalineShard: Oh that was me when I was like 14.
<CrystalineShard> gewt amped one of the worst examples
<CrystalineShard> getamped*

*pot80_GLaDos more silence
<Roseluck`> it made me yell RAWR really loud
<Stallion_of_War> Saturn, since you live closer to The Queen than I do, could you check and see if she's a werewolf or a shapeshifting lizard-lady?
<Saturn> 08,01Stallion_of_War: brb
*AttackWithHugs puts a stereo in the middle of the chat and turns it on.
<pot80_GLaDos> wubwubwubwubwub

<BladedWings> AttackWithHugs: wooo *pulls out a dj booth and a vinyl scratch* party time ^_^
<pot80_GLaDos> no stream right?
<Stallion_of_War> Why do people assume Slenderman wants to hurt you? Maybe you just dropped your wallet, and he's shy because he has no face.
<Stallion_of_War> I'm forming the Equal Rights for Slenderman group
<Saturn> 08,01Stallion_of_War: he just wants $20
<AttackWithHugs> Stallion_of_War, the ERS?
<Stallion_of_War> I'm trying to work an A between the e and the r, but yes
<Maid_RainBow1> bye bye everypony i have to go away for some time
<AttackWithHugs> Bye Maid_RainBow1
<pot80_GLaDos> bye Maid_RainBow1
<Stallion_of_War> Equal Active Rights for Slenderman - EARS
<Stallion_of_War> He should appreciate that, given he has none.
<Stallion_of_War> EARS for Slenderman
<Stallion_of_War> little redundant, but EARS is the group name so....
<pot80_GLaDos> why not eyes surely they would be more usefull for the slenderman. the poor blind man

<Tervicz> Question: is there a cure for MLp addiction?
<AttackWithHugs> Hi Tervicz
<Queen_of_War> One should certianly hope not! Sir Tervicz
<Tervicz> I used to be satisfied with a weekly dose, but now I almost need it constantly xP
<BladedWings> Tervicz: lol thats just normal i think ^_^
<pot80_GLaDos> One should certinately refrain from a filthy use of language such as this 'lol'
<pot80_GLaDos> sorry what are we doing?
<razorwing1269> howdy
<Kimori> Blako, still there?
<Blako> yup
<pot80_GLaDos> hiyah razorwing1269
<Kimori> Have you ever restored a computer using a system image on multiple dvds?
<Tervicz> Maybe someone should start a brony clinic?
<pot80_GLaDos> how are you today razorwing1269 ?
<razorwing1269> im great
<Blako> no, I didn't try it, I wasn't even able to make those cd's because it always printed some error
<razorwing1269> hey i can post here my youtube chanel
<alexxm> what have you been up to razorwing1269
<pot80_GLaDos> thats dandy
<Kimori> damn
<Kimori> I'm trying to restore an old image back to my laptop but the damn thing cant see it
<razorwing1269> i was editing my new pmv
<d3rb> hello bronystate
<Jmo> What are you doing up so late d3rb
<AttackWithHugs> Hey d3rb
<d3rb> just woke up jmo
<Blako> and it is image of the Windows only, or does it contain some other data? and what did you use to make the backup?
<Jmo> at 4:51AM bro?
<d3rb> went to bed really early
<Jmo> Righto. Understandable.
<alexxm> how've you been d3rb
<Kimori> its supposed to be the entire hard drive
<razorwing1269> whath time is
<Kimori> I just used the windows backup in the OS itself
<Kimori> unless that just backs up files?
<d3rb> meeh...good enough i guess alexxm
<d3rb> you?
<razorwing1269> hey i can post my youtube chanel?
<Blako> I don't know, I tried using some build in packardbell backup tool
<Blako> if there are some important data on the backup, I think there should be way to get them out
<Kimori> no there is no important data
<d3rb> as long as no one is streaming i guess so
<Kimori> What I wanted to do was put the factory system image that I made back to the laptop to see how many GB it would take
<Safari|foal> Oh hi again alexxm
<Kimori> then get a new/used hard drive that at least has that much GB
<Kimori> so that can help me in costs
<alexxm> how are things Safari|foal
<razorwing1269> ok here it is http://www.youtube.com/user/RazorWing1269?feature=mhee
<Kimori> But if its too much work, I might just go with another computer
<Safari|foal> Still completely awesome alexxm. :P
<Blako> maybe you could try asking others, maybe spyrorocks, he seems to know a lot about computers
<Blako> or stormy
<Kimori> yeah
<Safari|foal> Any change on your end alexxm?
<alexxm> nope
<Kimori> There was somone else I planned on asking, hes a manager of an IT univeristy

<Dken2021> ello there
<MASF123> No one tried to log in as me today...
<MASF123> yay
<d3rb> how can you tell?
<Barb|WHAT> Well. I have a brony problem guys. I am hopelessly and utterly addicted to pony. Not only am I accidently saying "Buck" to cuss, but I just read "Alcorn" as "Alicorn" =|
<Barb|WHAT> Should I seek help?
<NullRadix> if you're registered, when you log in it will tell you the number of failed attempts to log in
<Jmo> >_>
<Jmo> I can't tell if you're being serious or not Barb.
<MASF123> What NullRadix said.
<Dken2021> I think you're fine Barb
<Barb|WHAT> Being totally serious.
<Barb|WHAT> Okay. If I got to get any tattoos, and I tell you guys about it. STop me
<MASF123> Barb|WHAT it's normal, you just have to get used to that like the rest of us.
<Barb|WHAT> Jmo I am depending on you. DO NOT LET ME GET TATTOOO
<Barb|WHAT> I can trust you right? Riiiiggghtt.
<d3rb> Barb|WHAT, dont get a tatto
<Jmo> Ew tattoo.

<Jmo> Why would you get one in the first place, jeez.
<d3rb> ^
<killerpony7733> The temptation?
<MASF123> Barb|WHAT some people on Deviantart get MLP tattoos
<NullRadix> depends entirely on your reason for getting the tattoo
<Dken2021> I'd would hold it on the tattoo, that's like super commitment, and you'll probably regret it sometime later
<Barb|WHAT> Jmo I don't care for them, but I can get really drunk someimtes
<Barb|WHAT> I tend to wake up in strange beds.
<Jmo> Ew drinking.
<Barb|WHAT> With strange people.
<Jmo> Why would you drink in the first place, jeez.
<Safari|foal> NewDCD: neither roundabout nor lights? Or are the lights just hard to see?

<Barb|WHAT> People will go to great lengths.
<RainbowAsh> Hi Dken2021
<NullRadix> I'm not a tattoo person, but as I understand it tattoos are there to help define you. If you feel strongly enough that pony has had a large effect on your life, it's not crazy
<MadSurge> I drink only water and fizzy drinks :D

<RainbowAsh> pony_3290, ouch, I see. Sandy got you?
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Fawk
<pony_3290> yes
<Zack> 3 hours to go also howdy all im gonna get dizzy looking at that snake
<d3rb> pretty much Alchemist. Also i just dont get excited about much anymore
<[Alpha]> I always have high expectations so I'm always disappointed
<Alchemist> it happens
<pot80_GLaDos> I expect it to be awful (its a win win situation)
<Alchemist> d3rb: I was thinking about having some changes in my life too for the same reason. Too bad you need money for everything, so Im stuck :D
<Zack> pull the lever cronk *clunk* WRONG LEVAAAA
<d3rb> Alchemist, i cant relate to a lack of money
<Zack> anyoone who kows what thats from is awesome
<[Alpha]> The Emporer's New Groove
<Zack> yes /)
<RainbowAsh> pot80_GLaDos, I don't know, I like it better to have high hopes and be disappointed. The possibility of something potentially great coming is just part of the experience for me.
<[Alpha]> (\ :P
<DaringDerpy> good evening bronystate ^^
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai DaringDerpy :)
<d3rb> good morning DaringDerpy
<pot80_GLaDos> boom baby

<pot80_GLaDos> hai DaringDerpy
<DaringDerpy> RainbowAsh: better than expected :)
<DaringDerpy> still to drunk to chat with you guys...
<Zack> Afternoon DaringDerpy here have a muffin :)

<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Random thought. Jinkies is a sexy word.
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> That is all
<DaringDerpy> sun rising? indonesia?
<Dken2021> wait a minute... I have a wife! http://thebest404pageever.com/swf/Robo_Dales_Marital_Dance.swf
<Alchemist> RainbowAsh: its the right way of thinking imo if you can sustain it. I got tired of getting disappointed all the time so I followed the way d3rb|AFK does.
<Zack> i went for a walk couple minutes ago and looked at stars
<d3rb|AFK> DaringDerpy, nah close, australia. i mean its already mostly up
<Polydunami> Dken2021 dat duke nukem 3d music :3
<Zack> then the clouds came :|
<DaringDerpy> d3rb|AFK: you live in the future
<DaringDerpy> scary time
<Dken2021> the future must be nice
<d3rb|AFK> we got flying cars :P
<Alchemist> how is nov 3rd so far d3rb|AFK? No apocalypse yet?
<d3rb|AFK> no....not yet...
*DaringDerpy block flying cars for the sake of the old industrials
<DaringDerpy> +s
<RainbowAsh> Alchemist, there was a time when I was thinking like that, too. In the end I found that it was far harder.
<Zack> if i die itl be looking at stars
<Zack> or falling from the sky
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Its friday and I want the work day to be over already.
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> FFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU
<DaringDerpy> build your own flying car...I would buy one or ten :)
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Delorian?
<Polydunami> Delorean?
<Alchemist> RainbowAsh: I dont know if its harder, but it makes me feel nothing about anything after a while if that makes sense.
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Yeah that
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Cuase Delo-rain is just weird
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Never again.
<Zack> :3
<RainbowAsh> Alchemist, that makes total sense for me and is exactly what I found unbearable
<Zack> this chicken burger is tasty
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Delo Ryan.
<Polydunami> I love the Duke Nukem 3D theme :3
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Worst name ever.

<Polydunami> So... a hypothetical question. Can you really say, "I'm gonna kill you" without meaning what you say?
<Alchemist> of course
<Polydunami> -_(\ ask a stupid question :S
<RainbowAsh> Polydunami, you can anything without meaning it.
<pot80_GLaDos> Polydunami: in sarcasem! BOOM
<Safari|foal> CCCP: I was in the air and space museum yesterday, and it reminded me to ask you. Why did you choose to have CCCP, with all its connotations, as your nick?
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Beep. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-TADErG2yw
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Bop Bep
<Alchemist> try to put flour in the hairdryer before your sister/mom/gf uses it and see that you can.
*Polydunami is immediately turned off by the LotR music, which is pretty odd, considering how good it is :S
<Alchemist> I mean say im gonna kll you without meaning it
<Polydunami> You'll find out why I asked the question soon enough :3
<Safari|foal> Dat hook.

<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> It clears the sinuses anyways, so I do you a favor.

<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Nope. You want smut
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> You dirty dirty pony you.
<RainbowAsh> Barb|TapedOnKickMe, how dare you question my altruism! Harumpf
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Question everything.

<Invi> dat octavia doesn't look healthy
<Polydunami> The Persistence of Mare-mories? :P
<Alchemist> Polydunami: I dont think its a ponification of a specific painting, its just the motives. but great pun :D
<Dken2021> hey Thunder_Crescent
<Thunder_Crescent> howdy DKen2021
<Polydunami> If there was an erotic version of that painting, Alchemist, it would probably be called "The Persistence of Mammaries" :3
<Paspie> hey hye
<Paspie> *hey
<Polydunami> Oh hey, Paspie
<Dken2021> erotics? paintings? if? what's going on?

<Polydunami> Oh, so what's it called?
<Alchemist> Its the temptation of St Anthony
<Polydunami> Oh, I see
<Invi> crazy pic
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> No no no. Its Nudity: Y U NO CLOTHING?

<Polydunami> By the way, that Rainbow Dash is kind of... strange
*Polydunami doesn't notice Applejack's super-long hind legs :P
<Alchemist> too long mane and tail maybe?
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, they're in Poison Joke -_(\
<Alchemist> yep :)
<Alchemist> its genius
<Polydunami> I did not see the joke at first :S
<Alchemist> wish I had this kind of creativity
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> A burly russian man walks into bar. He leaves with sanvich.
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Funny yes?
<Invi> wasn't there an artist somewhen that used to shit on his pictures after painting?
<d3rb|AFK> return to chat, see this ^ what do
<Invi> hi d3rb
<Alchemist> Invi: I havent heard about it but I wouldnt be suprised if there was such an artist :D
<d3rb> hey Invi
<Cades> hey guys
<Lil_B> d3rb ignore it, it never happened >_>
<d3rb> done
<Aponymouss> http://www.terrariaonline.com/attachments/shitjustgotreal-jpg.5874/ xD
<Alchemist> I know there was one who only took photos of people's anuses... and i mean close up HD.
<Invi> why?
<Invi> did he want to steal peoples soul?
<d3rb> because art
<Stormy`> Hey
<Alchemist> Invi: because art and http://derpy.me/Nonqt
<Alchemist> I tried to google for anus art photography. bad move :D
<RaveBrony> ._.
<d3rb> :D
<Alchemist> i wanted to find the guy who did it before you jump to conclusions
<Invi> why would you google such a thing...
<Stormy`> I went in to have my professor sign a form for me and he roped me into debugging with him for like 2 hours
<Stormy`> -.-
<Barb|TapedOnKickMe> Gentlemen. It is almost time. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQXQrPdwego
<Safari|foal> Invi+1
<Invi> +1 to what?
<Kimori> :/
<Kimori> hope he was satisfied
<Safari|foal> Your question
<Alchemist> found a pic of his/her gallery, but no names. and pic is definitely NSFW :D
<RaveBrony> O_o
<Alchemist> People are weird.
<Stormy`> He sent me a message like 5 minutes after I left saying he fixed it
<Dken2021> yes we are
<d3rb> yup
<Aponymouss> Erm, how do i see the screen? nothing is there.
<Dken2021> because no one's using it atm
<Alchemist> Aponymouss: there is no stream, its supposed to be black.
<Invi> the snake from the snake game ate the stream and now chases itself
<Aponymouss> Oh ok
<Invi> I have 1:26 minutes on my brony CD left. what song should I add?
<Stormy`> Figured out some really convoluted way of making a simple test and was like "Isn't Ruby great?!"
<Safari|foal> Invi: Youtube style. :P
<Stormy`> I'm like no... that's awful code and it makes no sense
<Invi> yeah... don't you have any suggetions? ^^
<Safari|foal> Invi: that was a response to your snake comment
<Invi> ah ^^
<cowvarkian> is anything streaming
<Safari|foal> Invi: do you have ponyville summer?
<Invi> nope
<Dark92Enigma> Invi: maybe....the AVGN theme?
<Dark92Enigma> bad idea :D
<Invi> hmm...
<Stormy`> it's really ironic too because he used to lecture us all the time about making sure our code is readable; I could look at this monstrosity he wrote and forget what it meant within 5 minutes
<Invi> but ponyville summer is too long :<
<Safari|foal> Invi: 1 minute intro btw
<Polydunami> I'm going to be busy for a while. Be back later
<Invi> Safari|foal, yeah, but I have only 1 minute 26 left 6_9
<Invi> oh i found sth nice :3
<Invi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbIGnY_DSIE haven't heard that for a long time :D
<Safari|foal> Invi: I just have "best of pony tunes" 1 & 2 on, p
<Safari|foal> *on my phone
<Safari|foal> Plus my favourites otherwise
<Invi> I have about 7,1 hours of mostly brony metal on my Computer ^^
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #613
<Dken2021> there's that many brony metal songs?
<Alchemist> Invi: its not metal, but are you familiar with the rock song mandopony made for sibsy's birthday?
<Invi> Dken2021, well yeah, but i haven't heard much from Bronyfied lately. I hope he is going to do sth with the new season ^^
<Invi> Alchemist, i know mandopony but don't listen to his music ^^
<Safari|foal> Invi: I have the complete pony music archive on mine --- 28 GB of pony music. :P
<Alchemist> Dont like it?
<Invi> never even tried ^^

<Kawaii_icybeauti> Xcoder62: It sounds like the one from FIW
<Kimori> ah
<Bacon[Hazard]> Nittany_Discord You don't want to sound like a 13 year old, do you?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> hes one of those small men who try to make themselves look big.
<Sonny> Nittany_Discord: can you send me a link to her deviantart page? or her website?
<Michael> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "small man syndrome" its called.

<Kimori> wheres his "millions" that he speaks of
<Polydunami> *Latvia

<Polydunami> To the west.
<Kimori> wtf
<Bacon[Hazard]> Explains the accent.
<Paspie> right, bye
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> they exist only in his head.
<Bacon[Hazard]> I personally think the Russian accent is best accent.
<Kimori> Id ask him wheres his corvette lol
<Derpy_Hooves> floof
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> he spends at least 10 minutes with each customer bullshitting them about himself
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> to try to make himself look like a big man.
<Polydunami> I dunno, Germans have sexy accents too :3
<Michael> i find it funny :)
<weegee2062> i have an america accent :(
<Xcoder62> High school, same here
<Kimori> unless your there
<Bacon[Hazard]> Yeah, that's true.
<Xcoder62> we need to meet up
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> If im there he doesnt say anything.
<Kimori> exactly
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> because he knows i know its all bullshit.
<Kimori> cause hes probably scared of you
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I tell him off all the time.
<smrtgy1> I have a southern accent :)
<Polydunami> Wha, her real name :O
<Sonny> lovely style she had :D
<Kimori> and he talks back I assume?
<Sonny> has*
<Sonny> O_o

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. I love her art style.
<Kimori> hah
<Colt_Brovakiin> I like my britsh accent, it is formal but not sterotypical :P
<Xcoder62> Tumblur is hated! by her at least
<Bacon[Hazard]> Russian > German > Asian > African > British > American
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I also try to insert little jabs and pokes here and there
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She actually has a second ask blog now.
<Wubstep> I Have an Irish Accent Cuz Im Irish O3O
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> like hes selling this customer a pair of boots

<Sonny> she has an ask blog :o?
<Kimori> Sounds like hed be a good salesmen
<Sonny> cool

<Sonny> send me link pelase :D?
<Polydunami> I just found out Something is 19 :$
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so of course i walk by and say "hey jim, why dont you grab a pair?"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> he is a good salesman.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> very good.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Seriously? That's cool.
<Kimori> He should sell cars
<Polydunami> It's not exactly private information :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> except he breaks rule #1 of sales. he talks about himself.
<Polydunami> As in, she disclosed it herself on her DA
<Bacon[Hazard]> She sounds older. Maybe the accent? Because my Russian friend sounds about five years older than he actually is.
<Sonny> Nittany_Discord: can you send me the link to her blog :)? I'd like to see that :D
<Miksu4> i dont speak anything correctly because im finnish:P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> he has issues too, my dad and I started a new business last year and we are doing pretty well, so he tries to cause problems because hes jelious.
<Xcoder62> the first human that could fly, would be afraif of flying
<Polydunami> I can no speak anything but English
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. Ask Pegasus Lola http://ask-pegasus-lola.tumblr.com/ is her main blog. Her second one is Ask Lola and Tiny Bold. http://ask-lola-and-tiny-bold.tumblr.com/
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> His son is a jackass as well.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> like father like son.
<Polydunami> And even then, I talk English not well :P
<Xcoder62> Spider Dragon
<Kimori> Wait, are we talking about another business? or the same one
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> well how this works is
<Bacon[Hazard]> Spider Dragon? This is now canon.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> my dad and I operate a business out of the same property that my grandfather has his business
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so we often share employees.
<Polydunami> That is sexy :3
<Kimori> I see
<pot80_GLaDos> Xcoder62: I dunno were the wright brothers afraid of flying? :D
<Kimori> Is that why you dont trust them?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spike Da Dragon. It's another Tumblr.
<XxNightHawk64xX> what movie are they doing today
<Bacon[Hazard]> Is she watching the chat?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> no I dont trust him because he lies.
<Xcoder62> The Spider Dragon, Revoultionary at its finest pixel
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<Kimori> who lies?
<Polydunami> She's already asleep
<Polydunami> It's maybe midnight already in Latvia
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> everyone.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Oh, I thought it was Spider Dragon. Oh well, it is a still canon.
<Kimori> o.o
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> no one knows how to tell the truth.
<smrtgy1> I like how Something draws human versions of the pony characters. The translation is a lot less awkward than most humanized ponies :D
<Bacon[Hazard]> Anything this woman says is canon.
<Kimori> Not sure what to say on that..
<Xcoder62> pot80_GLaDos: The Wright Brothers did not have wings, they created wings
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> when you're blue, fire a few.
<Polydunami> They WANTED to fly
<Bacon[Hazard]> When did this go from something else to the Wright Brothers?
<pot80_GLaDos> still the first flying humans Xcoder62
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> actually it doesnt make sense to fire him
<Kimori> If the employees are shared how do you expect to fire them
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> because they are either on my payroll, or my grandfathers payroll.
<Xcoder62> Yea true, but i meant people that were born to fly
<Bacon[Hazard]> Are you implying that nobody flied before?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but they work for both companies.
<Xcoder62> If it were possible
<Bacon[Hazard]> Ever heard of hot air balloons?
<Xcoder62> did i hear "when i see ponies, saw mcdonalds?"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you dont fire senior employees though because you have to pay them big $$ in severence
<pot80_GLaDos> oh all right then :$
<Polydunami> Floating = Flying?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> for jim, probably would cost like $20-$30k on severence.
<Wubstep> Rainbow Dash! >3< :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> hes been bullshitting here for like 6 years
<Bacon[Hazard]> Pinkie Pie. What did I tell you? This woman is canon.
<Fluttershyfan158> Hi everypony!

<Polydunami> No
<Bacon[Hazard]> Yes.
<pot80_GLaDos> hiyah Fluttershyfan158
<Polydunami> It's pre-recorded, Fluttershyfan158

<IshPonyOfPonies> the movie is streaming, why is regular chat still ded? :(
<Miksu4> stupid adds
*Ghosties is summoned by Sumi
<cowvarkian> Saturn: GET OFF THE STAGE
<Dance1211> The remake is called "12"
<MrBen> I'm so happy I didn't actually have to go to jury duty once.
<Everlasting_Joy> "I've never been on a jury before!" ... You don't get out much do you son?
<Buytoast> ENTITLED?
<Floris> heavy voice, nice suit..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Miksu4: Adblock Plus.
<Kandarihu|Zoro> richfiles, no. The foreman gets 13 of them. Everyone else just gets one
<Kurra> HWOOOAGH
<Polydunami> This nerd guy is the one who voiced Piglet.
<AlienWarhead> Why are the pings extra loud?
<SirGanjalf> Those kids today, eh sir?
<Golgotha> I've only got called for jury duty once, didn't have to server.
*Sumica throws a lemmon wraped around a brick at Saturn
<richfiles> Saturn, The accused was a real pig!
<DocSane> Please stop it with the pings
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<Miksu4> link?
<Fluttershyfan158> hello Doctor Kliener!
<Meanwhile> Mayhaps people will show up an hour late.
<OohShiny> AlienWarhead: they scream a lot in the movie... jk
<Kurra> I love how the pings always ALWAYS happen at the perfect time for maximum funny.
<Saturn> 08,01RANdOM MOVIE TRIVIA: As shooting of the film went on, director Sidney Lumet gradually changed to lenses of longer focal lengths, so that the backgrounds seemed to close in on the characters, creating a greater feeling of claustrophobia.
<pony_1608> this black and white keeps switcjing to green and white
<MrBen> I was actually sort of afraid it would turn out almost exactly like this movie, only the accused wasn't for a murder but some traffic law violation or something.
<BaconMane> 0,5booooooooooooooo
<Floris> I suppose that man has a cold? He sure likes to sniff his cloth.
<Meanwhile> Tastes like pans-galactic gargle blaster Sumi.
<smrtgy1> The random noises are annoying :@
<Bjornfot> Yeah. Stupid Americans not following our daylight saving times.
<cowvarkian> Kurra: yet people dislike when it happens
<BaconMane> 0,5STOP DOIN DAT SUMI
<Kencolt> I've been called a few times-- only have serveed once, and the case was completely without reasonable doubt.
*Saturn 08,01is the new Silverscreen

<Tovler> this movie's volume is a tad low
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Don't we all? :(
<KJ> and how!
<Sumica> 00,10you realise how dumb that was yes BaconMane?
<J_E_Smith71> smrtgy1: Because people keep pinging Sumi
<MrBen> What happened to Silverscreen, anyway?
<Floris> Hi, Bloxx.

<alexxm|foal> how've you been Bloxx
<OJ> Are we still on the first shot?
<BaconMane> 0,5I dont get it!
<IshPonyOfPonies> sorry Bjornfot, otakon isn't here for you to rape yet
<MrBen> Midnight_Fyre: I almost did.
<Kandarihu|Zoro> Fluttershyfan158, the mod who is streaming this is getting pinged.
<Meanwhile> Red Spy is in the Jury!
<Kencolt> ROHKARA: At the time, they allowed smoking narly everywhere.
<Fluttershyfan158> oooh.
<pony_5091> I have the sudden urge to watch MSK3K now
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I've never been on jury. Thankfully.
<Floris> They sure all like to sit on the table.
<J_E_Smith71> MrBen: Left for home or somewhere with bad internet connection, which cut out his time here
<Dance1211> The butler did.
<MrBen> J_E_Smith71: Ah.
<Dance1211> iy
<Bjornfot> Nuuuh, it's not rape. He likes it.
<Polydunami> This guy is a jackass :|

<pony_666> 50 shades of grey
<Floris> Let it be!
<Saturn> 08,01he handles jugs.
<Bjornfot> Even though it still can be rape even if the victim likes it.
<J_E_Smith71> MrBen: Yep he stepped down
<Ghosties> 04Juror 47's gonna do a hit on all the other jurors
<AttackWithHugs> lol Saturn
<fluttercry> 05,15Let's not talk about rape okay?
<MrBen> J_E_Smith71: Alright. Thanks.
<Cypresswolf> DERPDERPDERPDERP: I have 1/3 - 2nd time cut -3rd time nobody was chosen for jury
<OohShiny> pony_666: porn for kids?
<Kurra> JUROR IS SPY
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties Ever read Runaway Jury :3?
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: funny you should say that; i was just about to tell a similar story about when i was on a jury
<Ghosties> 04Have not

<String_Shredder> Saturn: giggity giggity giggity
<Meanwhile> Talk about regular sex instead.
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties It's pretty good
<IshPonyOfPonies> fine...we'll talk about necrophilia then
<cowvarkian> brb
<SirGanjalf> Atleast now we know who's the Spy; Guy wearing Fancy Fedora, ofc
<Midnight_Fyre> Dammit@! Are you people talking about rape again?
<Wubstep> I Sneezed
<Wubstep> :)
<Fluttershyfan158> Did anything happen on Christmas? Just curious.
<fluttercry> 05,15No don't talk about that either
<Sumica> 00,10then start, dosei t matter where you stand?
<Bjornfot> Why not? Rape is not even NSFW. Is it because it's sensitive to some?
<IshPonyOfPonies> molestation?
<Saturn> 08,01this was the infamous "almost thrown out of court" story
<Tovler> I'd like to see the Casey Anthony remake of this movie.
<pony_666> Oohshiny arnt all romance novels girl porn?
<Saturn> 08,01it's better if i tell it over voice
<The_spy> that medic is a spy!

<Ghosties> 04BALTIMORE?!
<Polydunami> I like the old man
<pony_666> KJ Basic
<Floris> I like that old man.

<OohShiny> pony_666: well, 50 shades actually has sex scenes

<pony_666> *in
<Midnight_Fyre> I recognize a bunch of these guys from the Twilight Zone
<Moopy> Good
<Meanwhile> Only when you feel like it.
<cowvarkian> Floris: yeah
<Sumica> 00,10why an even number
<Sumica> 00,10I will never get it.
<Ghosties> 04And one won't
<cowvarkian> well, movies over
*Michael raises hand
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties in a real jury, it wouldn't be so clear cut ^^'
<DocSane> Never, ever do open voting.
<Floris> That old man goes with the flow.
<Meanwhile> Either go police the chat that actually needs it, or police them equally.
<Floris> D:
<Bjornfot> Ok. What are everyone's thoughts on Assassin's Creed III?
<Ghosties> 04BAM
<Ghosties> 04Huh
*SirGanjalf raises hand
<Tovler> O COME ON!
<IshPonyOfPonies> what about when otakon gets here and Bjornfot sees him, then can we talk about it?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Looks like he just made 11 men angry.
<Meanwhile> Never got interested in the franchise.
<DocSane> Because it leads to this movie.
<OohShiny> 1 not guilty
<OohShiny> fail
<Ghosties> 04This seems awwwwfully familiar to a Hey Arnold! episode
<RaveBrony> nor did i
<Kurra> I wanna kick that old stuck up guy.
<KJ> INTEGRITY!!!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> ^^^
<XylemTube> "there's always one" what a jackass
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties Durrrhmm...
<fluttercry> 05,15Meanwhile we can't be everywhere at once, but we can take care of things as we see them.
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties Hey arnold! Is a fantastic artform :D
<RaveBrony> Assassin's Creed seems like my kind of game...but i just stuck with what i had.
<SirGanjalf> That Henry Fonda is a SPY!
<Sumica> 00,10but do you want the kid to be dead
<Tovler> 18 is old enough. 14 is not.
<Saturn> 08,01i love this film
<Fluttershyfan158> Here's an interesting pony idea..A BLACK AND WHITE THEMED EPISODE! and not a bit part!
<alexxm|foal> well it was gonna be a short movie if it went if someone didn't oppose
<Sumica> 00,10that is the point
<pony_666> @Ghosties its based off this play
<Everlasting_Joy> This guy's lonely.
<OJ> Take off your damn hat
<Moopy> Umm hey sumica that #Rainbow Dash thing showed on my screen here and it shouldn't be like that
<Meanwhile> Except when you choose to ignore it. Look, I don't care which it is, but pick one option or the other. Don't flipflop.
<Floris> He sure doesn't know much.
<Kandarihu|Zoro> I really shouldn't be given Jury duty. I'm too aspergers for that.
<Cades> I'm good thanks
<Ghosties> 04The entire episode was centered around Arnold and his colleagues being jurors for a school case against one of their friends, and Arnold was the only one that was like "Not guilty" and then explained why. Eventually he managed to prove the guy innocent
<Cades> hey amu
<Polydunami> Those voting guilty? *Everyone raises their hand* Okay, lets go *credits play*
<Bjornfot> I think it's a shame how MURRIKUHN it is. The previous games were not very "Italian" or marketed towards Italians...
<Sumica> 00,10rainbowdash thing?
<Miksu4> did rd chance position 0_0
<AttackWithHugs> I've never been chosen for jury duty, and I hope I never do.
<KJ> good for you, fancy fedora
<SirGanjalf> And then movie last for 101 years
<fluttercry> 05,15I don't choose to ignore things, maybe others do. But when I see things, I take action. I can't catch everything
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: RD channel, I think.
<cowvarkian> Ghosties: well, I know how this movies going to end then
<Moopy> Yeah like this #Rainbow Dash
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties and that one of the jurors was?
<Sumica> 00,10What about it?
<DocSane> This story has been parodied endlessly.
<Kurra> PWNT
<OJ> This is what I call an Actin' Film.
<AJIsAwesome> So side channels are now open?
<SirGanjalf> Cool story, bro
<OohShiny> so, 12 guys around a table, discussing if the defendant is guilty or not... for about 96 minutes?
<Floris> The new guy is really intense.
<Ghosties> 04Can't remember who did it
<Kurra> SCREW YOU FULL O YOURSELF OLD MAN HAHA
<Polydunami> Better than it sounds, OohShiny
<Everlasting_Joy> This already has me interested. I want to see these guys want each other dead.
<graywhoof> i like big nose
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties kid with bowler cut
<Wubstep> Lets Just Sit There For The Lols : D
<ekips> damnit, I'm late again, am I?
<Ghosties> 04Like I said OohShiny at the beginning of the opening credits
<timer2> [19:08:54] <EleanorAwesome> je vois de la creme glacée
<Pale_Horse> See, this is why you have 12 jurors in the first place. So you have a good pool of people thinking about the issue.
<Tamazarashi> can I please hear that story now?
<Fluttershyfan158> hey! anypony wanna watch some twilight??
*Kurra SHOOM hooves
<Michael> ohai ekips
<AttackWithHugs> Ghosties, I remember that! Is that the one when Harold and his friends mooned the principal and Arnold was threatened to have a mark on his record?
<Ghosties> 04Two hours. Jurors talking.
<Deadlypon3> Ghosties did it cause Eugine wrecked his pencil :P
<Randomiser> 1 Angry kid
<Moopy> well i don't know if i should be going into that and chat in there

<OohShiny> Ghosties: interesting... NOT
<Ghosties> 04I just remember it was like this
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> so when dose teh fightin seens strt?
<J_E_Smith71> Fluttershyfan158: After the movie...oh wait it's a Rarity episode
<Deadlypon3> ....Father :'(?
<Ghosties> 04I admit, this is a really interesting concept
<alexxm|foal> i remember the robot chicken paraody of this
<Pale_Horse> 12 Angry Ponies... :|
<Ghosties> 04But in film...I'm not so sure
<Bloxx> lol where's the baysplosions
<OohShiny> Ghosties: but as I love to participate in BMN, I will watch it
<The_Medic> @ghosties there was also a king of the hill episode that parody this except instead of discussing a court case they voted on weather or not they would start making a lawn mower with a bunch of bells and whistles
<KJ> yeah, tell him!
<Floris> Old man goes !
<Meanwhile> Well, since the general reaction is to just pay more attention to mane since really, we don't need it. Maybe you should take a leaf out of the book.
<Floris> GO!
<Fluttershyfan158> Secret of My Excess
<fluttercry> 05,15Ghosties this is a classic :(
<Fenr> old man enrages
<pony_1608> HOORAY OLD WISE MAN
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Old Man is a badass.
<Bipolarized> We're grown ups! We shouldn't have to talk like adults!
<Tovler> Its a contest to figure out which two people sound the most alike.
<graywhoof> i dont like big nose anymore
<SirGanjalf> mmmm rice pops
<Wubstep> Rice Pops
<Ghosties> 04I'm hoping it's good
<XylemTube> I think it's worth noting that Malcom in the middle directly references this episode at some point
<Wubstep> ^w^
<cowvarkian> Ghosties: the episode is called flase alarm
<Shizuka> 13Enough.
<Pale_Horse> My Angry Pony... My Angry Pony... ARRRGH!!! :[

<Nyst> This movie has some nice editing.
<CAPSLOCKHERO> HE SOUNDS ABOUT 60 YEARS YOUNGER THAN HE IS
<Meanwhile> Yet again, the point of this room is for lols outside of the usual chat avalanche.
<Kurra> All of Buried took place in a wood coffin and that was INTENSE.
<Fluttershyfan158> Hello Dr. Kliener!

<KaitoThePony> Flooooooooorrooooar

<Deadlypon3> He is more depending on ruling out the evidence of him being GUILTY
<XylemTube> Angry fuck still sitting in the corner XD
<Fenr> hi juror 10 in the corner
<Meanwhile> Mostly about closeups
<IshPonyOfPonies> Bjornfot not here unfortunately
<Moopy> So whats the point but heres my question Gulity or not Gulity? and it can not be both so you have to choose which one
<Apokalipse> I just started watching
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> He kind of looks like the dad from A Christmas Story
<fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity they're liking it surprisingly
<SirGanjalf> Kurra: Ah, so the old guy is racist against french.
<Meanwhile> And the number of times someone's been burned.
<twilight_sprinkle> ...look i dunno, mebbeh hes right, but maebbe hes naht
<fluttercry> 05,15I was expecting people to complain
<Apokalipse> It looks like it'd be a good movie if I watched it from the beginning...
<Kurra> SirGanjalf, I dunno if that's true
<RAWRity> I love this movie, but I know the chat is rather flightly with stuff like this.
<Ryunosuke> across the L train, in the middle of the night, and was STILL able to positive ID the perp?

<AttackWithHugs> Old guy looks like he's about to break down and cry.
<Spazturtle> So guys, Guilty or Not?
<Kurra> the guy looks like the Green Goblin um, actor guy from Spiderman.
<MrBen> J_E_Smith71: xD
<twilight_sprinkle> wouldnt the baseball game be canceled anyway due to the storm?
<fluttercry> 05,15J_E_Smith71 that would be a hanged jury
<RAWRity> Granted, there IS a huge issue. When that guy started doing his OWN invesigation, he should have been kicked out immediaely
<SirGanjalf> Mad Men guy is hesitant

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i Stare in to your buffer.... and your soul...
<twilight_sprinkle> ANGER 100% , +2000 POINTS
<Nyst> So he's guilty until proven innocent to him?
<Sebiale> I've heard people say this movie is about overcoming prejudice, but more than that, I think it's really about showing people the power of critical thinking.
<magmablock> Can you proove the justice of our culture?
<Floris> It's over 900- Oh wait.
<Wubstep> Oh gawd he mad

<SaxyPretender|Dinner> 0,14it's clearly Jesus magic!
<slendy> RAGE QUIT
<Tovler> I've got all the WHAT'S here?
<Saturn> 08,01RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Sidney Lumet had the actors all stay in the same room for hours on end and do their lines over and over without taping them. This was to give them a real taste of what it would be like to be cooped up in a room with the same people.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> An angry and insulting raging guy reminds you most of liberals? Not the Glenn Becks and Rush Limbaughs?
<Sumica> 00,10and they just glare and judge
<Friendchips> It's Mulia Mild
<Jawn> sad part here...
<Floris> THE STARE!

<Rosfox> :(
<Wubstep> Awww D':
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OWS was misdirected.
<Michael> rage quit
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This guy's just raging over the son he was utter shit to.

<Ghosties> 04He wasn't a jerk
<Floris> <3
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....that's....very emotional
<slendy> OH SNAP
<Nyst> Ghosties: he tried to make a 'man' out of his son and his son got in a fight with him and ran away from home.
<fluttercry> 05,15Wow
<Wubstep> </3
<Saturn> 08,01RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Because of the demands of the film's low budget, if the lighting was set up for a shot that took place from one particular angle, all the shots from that same angle had to be filmed then and there. This meant that different sides of the same conversation were sometimes shot several weeks apart.
<Deadlypon3> He beated his son and hadn't seen him in years
<BroPony|MEDIC|COFFEE> he just had problems with his son :(
<fluttercry> 05,15This film is powerful
<Miksu4> good thing i watched ballad of the brony to get to here
<DocSane> They don't prove him innocent. They just declare that there's reasonable doubt as to his guilt.
<BaconMane> 0,5Im feeling yhis
<BaconMane> 0,5*this
<Everlasting_Joy> That was great.
<Saturn> 08,01all my feels
<Deadlypon3> ...he beated his son for not standing up for himself in a fight
<OJ> The Golden Age of cinema
*slendy is crying

<Wubstep> ^^
<Sumica> 00,10notice there has been almost no sound effects at all besides the fan and the rain
<pony_666> movie is very good 10/10
<DocSane> KJ: Stay for the episodes and the B movie.

<IshPonyOfPonies> pants/10
<slendy> youtr welcome K_A

<SaxyPretender|Dinner> 0,14FLUTTERCRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<Ryunosuke> kj stick around :)
<Jawn> and here comes the happy ending :3
<slendy> KJ:
<fluttercry> 05,15twilight_sprinkle no. He's declared not guilty, acquited, the end
<Tassadork> if they all say not guilty, he's free
<Floris> Great movie.
<BroPony|MEDIC|COFFEE> KJ: /)
<Kencolt> It's rare that we get a classic of this stature. I usually have to wait for TCM to show it.
<J_E_Smith71> KJL It's not over yet we've only just begun!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Glad you liked it KJ, but we have three more shows remaining.
<fluttercry> 05,15Sumica I was so into the movie I didn't even notice that
<MrBen> And the guy helped No. 3 with his coat.
<Kandarihu|Zoro> Nittany_Discord, it coopted a lot of innocent people who just wanted to lash out at who they thought was the cause of their misfortune. But the heart of it is pure evil.
<slendy> KJ: BROHOOF?
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttercry: hm, well that doesnt seem to good either..
<Cezar> oooo white jacket. now that's classy
<Ghosties> 04WHITE SUIT MEANS HE'S A GOOD GUY
<MrBen> That's compassion right there.
<Ghosties> 04SYMBOLISM
<KJ> I'm not ready to leave...just glad to be here.
<Meanwhile> 12/10
<Saturn> 08,01RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: As the film failed to make a profit, Henry Fonda never received his deferred salary. Despite this setback, Fonda always regarded 12 Angry Men as one of the three best films he ever made, the other two being The Grapes of Wrath and The Ox-Bow Incident.
<Floris> I'm gonna suggest to my friends.
<KJ> slendy BROHOOF!
<slendy> SYMBOLISM
