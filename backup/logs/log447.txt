<FlareChaser> so hey guys :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Kipkat07_Mare: I'm so sorry that happened, but just going outside isn't always going to get you arrested. You hung out with some real jackasses and got the bad side of things. I'm sorry your mother made you do that, but you should tell her what happened and that you need to have her consider your judgements as much as her own. I would have cried possibly too if I was arrested for
<SuperBrony64> 11,2something I didn't do, but it wasn't that big of a crime or anything so you don't really have to worry too bad about it. Just keep in mind that there are jerks out there in the real world and you need to know who they are and avoid them whenever possible.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Slurry requested it for while they are on vacation
<otakon> that's a lot of bacon ScootaChicken

<FlareChaser> SuperBrony64: whoa, what happened? I wasnt here.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> He even went and banned them both from here and main chat
<GilDash> Heh, if I got arrested I'd rather rot than tell my parents. They'd go ballistic. :D
<FlareChaser> ...what happened?

<Conyst> Meanwhile Nord Mead
<TheHoodyNinja> No SB dont cry about anything ever
<FlareChaser> WHAT HAPPENED? Somepony tell me ;_;
<TheHoodyNinja> Ok almost anything
<Meanwhile> I wonder why they felt the need to be so absolute.
<Meanwhile> Mr smooth.
<Litwick> I don't cry at anything. Go ahead link me something that'll "make me cry".
<otakon> FlareChaser: system crash, they only said it 12 times now.

<Pinkies4thWall> Timid
<teh_Tharassan> prideful
<drfsupercenter> 03yep
<RaveBrony> Prideful
<drfsupercenter> 03the first few Radio Disney CDs were actually good
<Vordox> Don't see Spitfire as a dominant persona, Prideful and Timid sounds more to her
<piratecatboy> Wrek : prideful
<drfsupercenter> 03I played a couple tracks from them on my show
<Vordox> Prideful since she is a Wonderbolt
<Bobeh> Timid.

<Dashie20Percent> Ponies47: How did you do that without making a google account?
*Michael hugs Ponies47
<nickstr> although its good timing

<Ponies47> RaveBrony: I was borrrrrrred!
*Dashie20Percent glomps everypony
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: Ah wearing a dress isnt that bad... I did it once to get into a convention for free :D My gf at the time was laughing her ass off all day... :D
<CupcakeWarrior> I wonder what I would look like as a maid
<Om> RaveBrony: Free is good, it only cost a change in atire
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd look ugly.
<Dashie20Percent> I'm fine with wearing dresses, I guess. Wanna know why?
<BlueFlare> 02if you can play whatever you want, then you should just play static
<BlueFlare> 02:3
<nickstr> nope
<nickstr> thats illegal
*alexxm hugs Dashie20Percent
<Ponies47> Dashie20Percent: Just used my 3rd Email :P. Wen your making a account they let you make A Gmail right on the spot :P
<RaveBrony> Om: Yep, I had to wear the dress for 30 and greet people :D
<BlueFlare> 02LOL really?
<Ponies47> *when
<nickstr> yes
<RaveBrony> *30 minutes
*Michael glomps Dashie20Percent
<drfsupercenter> 03well, more than a certain amount at least
<CupcakeWarrior> Someone should draw all of our OCs in maid outfits
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RaveBrony: Embarrassing?
<Om> RaveBrony: That aint to bad
*mario_pony has been lurking
*GilDash would love to secretly dress up as a maid. :$
<nickstr> yes
<BlueFlare> 02why is it illegal? O_o
<nickstr> I forget how much though
<alexxm> hey mario_pony hows your day been
*Dashie20Percent glomps Michael
<hen3ry> draw ALL the OCs? :(
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: Nah... Im very secure in my manhood :P Plus my gf was hot :D
<drfsupercenter> 03well it's not "illegal" but it goes against FCC policies :P
<drfsupercenter> 03because you can't just not have stuff playing
*Michael uberglomps Dashie20Percent
<WallDives> GilDash: why secretly?
<Om> GilDash: Not a secret anymore now is it.
<nickstr> but I am pretty sure part 73 of the FCC rules and regulations should shed some light
*Dashie20Percent is a tomboy who would HATE wearing a maid outfut
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I see nothing wrong with wearing dresses. Women wear pants nowadays.
<GilDash> Om: No... :D
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why our station just plays music from a computer when nobody's hosting a show
<CupcakeWarrior> My girlfriend has been trying to get me to cosplay as Sora
<Ponies47> Is listening to a remix of the My Little Pony Friendship is Magic theme song
<Dashie20Percent> CupcakeWarrior: OMG I love Sora!
<RaveBrony> CupcakeWarrior: Whats wrong with that? Many girls cosplay as Sora :P
<panda> Nittany_Discord: oh you :D
<mario_pony> alexxm: well i ate a whole box of cereal with half a gallon of milk and now i feel sick so pretty good how about you?

*Dashie20Percent uberglomps Michael
<nickstr> I am operating myself under part 15
<mario_pony> no way!!
<GilDash> WallDives: It's not the kind of thing one admits. :D I'd love to wear it for laughs and see people's expressions. I've got a couple of hawaiin shirts I wear at winter for the same reason. :D
*RaveBrony thinks a chick in baggy pants is cute tbh >.>
<alexxm> i'm good mario_pony how come you haven't been on lately
<CupcakeWarrior> RaveBrony: But she does cosplay as Sora
<Michael> :O :O
<WallDives> ah.
<Ponies47> So today I have Fluttershy in my room. And shes so cute! :)
*Michael is uberglomped
<mario_pony> alexxm: videogames, tumblr, and school
<Dken2021> hai mario_pony!
<alexxm> ah right mario_pony
<nickstr> but if I used a programmable oscilator instead of a crystal (with no phase noise of course) and had some more filtering my little exciter/transmitter would be legal to drive a power amplifier at a licensed radio station
<CupcakeWarrior> 13 more school days left :O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just thought maid cosplay for charity would be fun.
<Wrek> 05hmm

<Michael> Ponies47: rly?
<RaveBrony> CupcakeWarrior: Oops, i read that wrong, i thot you said She cosplays as him :P Whats wrong with Sora then? You should totally do it! :)
<panda> Nittany_Discord: that would be awesome! I'd totally join
<Dken2021> music's ok
<RaveBrony> and take pics!! :D
<Om> It might be entertaining
<nickstr> no matter how long I have the transmitter on for it just WILL NOT DRIFT!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01panda: Sounds fun.
<panda> Nittany_Discord: though I dont have a maid outfit ^^

<CCCP> hi RainbowAsh
<RainbowAsh> Hi CCCP
<RaveBrony> Vordox: Did you do that??
<mario_pony> hi RainbowAsh

<Vordox> RaveBrony: Yeah, Wrek was drawing and I felt the "Itch"
<RainbowAsh> Also hi mario_pony
<mario_pony> :)
<Vordox> It's not detailed, it's a fast speed draw. And some details and proportions are crap. <.<

<OtakuTom> Yes, I fully approve of this music :3
<Dermathil> Shamaid: Chat is repetitive because you let it be. It was never "repetitive" back when there wasn't as much people and as much RP.
<ChrysaMaid> sleep well
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Petrified_Maid: u sicko i was poking her with a unicorn horn i am a alicorn

<Saturn> 08,01viking is best bed.
<Saturn> 08,01you should all know this by now.
<prince-dari> Dermathil: I agree with you on the RP.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01RP is discouraged here because it got out of hand once.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> <----
<Shamaid> Dermathil.....again i see your point but thats what happens when somthing get popular
<MaidWarrior> Suddenly dari
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> its says in my name Petrified_Maid
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> I wouldn't know I've never slept on a viking
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I try to cap Maid Hour RP.
<Saturn> 08,01also, can we get something straight
<DaringMaid> Maid_Discord: story tiem do tell\
*Petrified_Maid wonders how long before Alicorn_Prince_Shane catches on :)
<Maid_Discord> 11,01To just very minor stuff.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Petrified_Maid: ?
<Saturn> 08,01i'm a pervert for being me
<Irish_Pony> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4729/ Not sure if want...
*ChrysaMaid dusts away anything more than dusting

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> no i dont Petrified_Maid
<Irish_Pony> Saturn ILL DRINK TO THAT!
<Saturn> 08,01Irish_Pony: you'll drink to anything
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Petrified_Maid: just say it
<Petrified_Maid> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Exactly
<Dermathil> Shamaid: Shouldn't have gotten popular in a place whose RULES say "no excessive RP". Same thing with a certain song about a certain day of the week.
<OtakuTom> Suuure you aren't, Saturn :P
*Petrified_Maid has been trolling Alicorn_Prince_Shane from the start :D
<Irish_Pony> Saturn thats why everypony loves me :P
<mario_pony> Maid_Discord: how much out of hand?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> sigh
<Dermathil> and LOL Saturn. Dat 2nd meaning.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> isnt trolling against the rules Maid_Discord ?
<Shamaid> Dermathil: i ment the site...with the more people you get a lot less stabilty and people smart enough to read the rules..
<Irish_Pony> Saturn oh and also for my new OC
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Malicious trolling.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol k
<Petrified_Maid> swaaaaaaaaaaag
<Maid_Discord> 11,01mario_pony: Quite. It was going r34.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> should change it so ppls no get confused
<hen3ry> ppls always get confusled.
<Petrified_Maid> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: But confusing people is what I do! :D
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> It nearly goes r34 almost all the time :/
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane attacks Petrified_Maid with the power of something something
<Dermathil> Shamaid: I was around since The founding days. I was around when the non-BMN chat was consisting of 8 people in the morning and as many as 20 on rare occasions in evening. (8 consisting of ME and the mods. YEAH.)
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> OmegaMaidtroidBrony: dafuq?
<Saturn> 08,01OtakuTom: i'm so unperverted, it hurts... my boyfriend. he wants to be intimate, but my sensibilities just won't allow it. he thinks i don't love him anymore, and says i'm not the man he fell in love with. the stress is causing me to question my role in society, and my worth as a human being.
<Petrified_Maid> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: *summons Maid_Tom to defend himself http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/267/3/a/this_one__s_for_you_john_by_figgs-d4aubih.png

<PinkiePieFTW> half naked twilight desktop background...
<MaidWarrior> Saturn: Are you talking about otakon?
<Shamaid> Dermathil: and thats good for you....and i honestly could care less...but again when somthing gets popular it becomes harder to contain...
*Maid_Discord 11,01dusts Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<Saturn> 08,01MaidWarrior: ssssh! we're not allowed to ship otakon!
<PinkiePieFTW> why do people find ponies more sexual when they they wear MORE clothes?
<pyrocatboy> Wrek : cheesy pr0n music pls.

<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> *cough* Indeed *cough*

*Petrified_Maid launches battleship to defend Otakon from ships
<ChrysaMaid> OmegaMaidtroidBrony seriously? where
<Irish_Pony> Saturn ship him to Bronycon :'(
<Saturn> 08,01seriously guys, no shipping otakon. he really doesn't like it, and it's now bordering on harassment.
<Shamaid> Dermathil: ya sure? cause i've never gone farther than a little dusting
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Irish_Pony: is not romantically shipping otakon but legit shipping like in crate on ship Saturn
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> I lost the link ages ago

<Saturn> 08,01Ingwaz: the fact remains that i want to love pretty much everyone in *that* way
<Petrified_Maid> Dermathil: :O No I didn't! Thank you :)
<Saturn> 08,01i see a lot of beauty, everywhere
<Dermathil> Look up Angry Joe's review.
*Petrified_Maid slaps Irish_Pony
*Irish_Pony kicks Petrified_Maid in the groin
*ChrysaMaid holds back on replacing otakon with Saturn
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane pours magically whiskeu on Petrified_Maid and Irish_Pony
*Petrified_Maid writes a mean story about Irish_Pony and publishes it in a reputable newspaper
<Dermathil> Wait, THERE'S A TOPIC. "Battleship the Movie Game" is a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER. Discuss.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> whiskey*
<ChrysaMaid> must. not. ship.
<Irish_Pony> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: what does that do excatly???

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> off to kill OmegaMaidtroidBrony s income
*MaidWarrior goes to watch the angry joe revie
<Petrified_Maid> Irish_Pony: Well...I guess THAT'S over :D

<Irish_Pony> Saturn :P
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> TTnTT
<Shamaid> soo very confused
<Irish_Pony> Petrified_Maid: Tuce?
<Cypresswolf> I can't see the eclipse because its too cloudy - Houston was to see a little bit of it - too far below the tree line where Im at :/
<Saturn> 08,01Dermathil: who the fracking frack is going to *buy* that?
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Nothing I can do for those poor men
<MaidWarrior> Dermathil: FOOOUUR HOOOOOURRRS
<ChrysaMaid> Saturn far too many people
<PinkiePieFTW> something tells me this guy likes twilight sparkle...
<Saturn> 08,01i mean... for fuck's sake... seriously...
<Petrified_Maid> Irish_Pony: Maybe not a tuce, but a truce sounds fine ;)
<Dermathil> Saturn: those who thinks it will not be a FPS.
<Dermathil> MaidWarrior: IKR
<RyunosukeKnT> I have heard BS movie was actually WORSE than Transformers 3, Priest, and all 3 Chipmunk movies combined, confirm?
<Irish_Pony> Petrified_Maid: Good...*slaps with cinderblock he stole from Meanwhile*
<Saturn> 08,01Dermathil: but... i can play battleship with a piece of carboard, 2 pieces of paper and a pen!
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Petrified_Maid> Irish_Pony: *dies from head trauma*
<Irish_Pony> HUZZA!
<PinkiePieFTW> i can play battleship with that, minus the cardboard.
<Shamaid> Dermathil: question......what exactly are you talking about? cause im confused
<Dermathil> Saturn: the game isn't even lipsync'd. EVERYBODY WEARS A BALACLAVA so you don't see the mouth.
<Dead_Maid> Irish_Pony: My blood is now on your hands
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Dermathil: They released Battleship: The Game at $60?
<Saturn> 08,01Dermathil: the nerve!
<OtakuTom> FPS games tend to be the most popular games out there, and I can't think of a movie tie-in game that's been a FPS...that part in itself is a unique idea, at least...not neccessarily a good one, but at least unique.
<Dermathil> YES THEY DID
<hen3ry> sun look strange
<MaidChaser> wat
*Irish_Pony throws Dead_Maid into the cellar with the..."rest" and cleans his hooves
<MaidChaser> HEY KIDS!
<Shamaid> oh NOW i get what your talking about Dermathil....kinda
<Cypresswolf> could anyone else see the eclipse?
<PinkiePieFTW> hey maid
<mario_pony> .-.
<CeilingKirz> 1,3L4D: The Movie
<desertman2> I will soon
<Saturn> 08,01seriously, you can get a ticket to BUCK for less that it costs to buy that shitty game
<Irish_Pony> GOD NO!
<Saturn> 08,01(coem to BUCK)
<Shamaid> CeilingKirz: isnt that the game anyways?
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> No eclipse here :(
<hen3ry> watching online. only a partial here in vegas.
<Dead_Maid> PinkiePieFTW: You're going to need to be way more specific :D
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Well it was published by Activision.
<Dermathil> Saturn: you get 10$ off to see the movie when you buy a retail of the movie
*Saturn 08,01plug plug plug
<PinkiePieFTW> every maid!
<PinkiePieFTW> :D
<Dermathil> *game
<ChrysaMaid> Saturn i already am, i'm still waiting on accomodation confirmation though
<Dead_Maid> PinkiePieFTW: YAY
*pyrocatboy eats some soylent green.
<Saturn> 08,01Dermathil: movies cost more than $10?
<hen3ry> and it is lame eclipse, moon is smallest it can be today by coincidence, not quite big enough to completely cover sun
<PinkiePieFTW> hm... i'm not to good with emotes
<Saturn> 08,01ChrysaMaid: did you get your package?
<ChrysaMaid> not yet
<Maid_Discord> 11,01So pricing a low-quality game at $60 shouldn't be surprising.
<Saturn> 08,01did you parents yet?
<Dermathil> Theater tickets do at places. So they give you a free entry to go watch it.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I've seen gameplay of it.
<RyunosukeKnT> see: hollywood wonders why people pirate movies, when they put out shit like Battleshit
<Maid_Discord> 11,01It's more of a $30 game.
<ChrysaMaid> not on thurs when i spoke to them last
<Shamaid> hey CeilingKirz wanna do a campaign? im bored and i REALLY need somthing to do..
<ChrysaMaid> ill ask again tomorrow if i speak to them
*pyrocatboy eats some soylent green.
<ChrysaMaid> what on earth did you buy me?
<Saturn> 08,01do any of you play Go?
<MaidWarrior> Whats that?
<RyunosukeKnT> I wish I did
<Wrek|Obsermaid> 05hows that
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Nope I'm not a PC gamer
<Light_Latias> 12wheeeeeee
<Dermathil> Maid_Discord: the missions are ALL THE EXACT SAME. You go on foot to disable Radar JAMMERS with C4 to allow you to get fleet fire support
<OtakuTom> Activision will do anything to make as much money off of a product as possible. I really can't stand them, and I hate the fact that Blizzard teamed with them for their game distribution.
<Light_Latias> 12got another disc in Minecraft~
<RyunosukeKnT> Go,... isnt a pc game per se
*OmegaMaidtroidBrony will be forever a console newbie
<OtakuTom> I wish I played Go. I never have, though.
<TheRainbowDash> Oh, back everypony. I almost got my story finished.:)

<Aeroslash> "OMG we bot love cherry popsicles, you are my SOULMATE"
<Ingwaz> prince-dari: i had somebody who is probably one of the dumbest people i've seen on facebook say it was awesome, i think that speaks volumes for the actual movie
<Aeroslash> *both
<Aeroslash> XD
<Dermathil> The movie is bad enough, but the game is WORSE^10
<prince-dari> Lawl Ingwaz
<Aeroslash> I keed
<GilDash> Is that Dashie's cutie mark hanging around her neck? ;)
<Ingwaz> its far too bad its a bad movie, hopefully hasbro is able to regain all of their costs
<PinkiePieFTW> you know what movie was good?
<Maid_Discord> 11,01And then Activision has the nerve to charge full-price for a mediocre knock-off.
<mario_pony> what if they made a mlp movie with aliens
<hen3ry> Ingwaz: Case of "your approval shames me" huh?
<PinkiePieFTW> avengers.
<PinkiePieFTW> I thought it was good. and funny.
<BlueFlare> 02but it's hard to find someone who likes cherry popsicles D:
<PinkiePieFTW> lovin' that necklace...
*BlueFlare flees
<Petrified_Maid> mario_pony: Aliens in Equestria, huh? Or, like, a Michael Bay re-imagining of MLP?
<Aeroslash> lol suuuure
<Aeroslash> ;P
<mario_pony> and it's not even ponies just people
<mario_pony> that have the same names
*Tovler checks to see if Battleship officially failed at the box office.
<Ingwaz> hen3ry: basically. one time he got pissed because someone called him a not so nice word for a gay person. so he called them that back. when i explained the stupidity of it, he said, if they give me crap, i'll lower my self past their level 10x and give them crap back
<Shamaid> Maid_Discord: yep this looks like it COMPERLY sucks
<Cypresswolf|Spy> I can forgive Hasbro for Battleship movie, if they come out with FIM movie
<PinkiePieFTW> lol battleship...

<Dashie_Dashie> helloooooooooo everyponyyyyyyy~
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Oh hi Dashie_Dashie
<Dermathil> PinkiePieFTW: one more reason why people thought Battleship was SO BAD. After seeing such a great tale with awesome characters that everybody LOVED on the big screen, and the movie ended up being more Bay crap.
<Shamaid> ello Dashie_Dashie
<Ponies47> I WANT A PONY MOVIE! :[
<RaveMaid> Lol
<Ingwaz> Cypresswolf|Spy: i really hope they do, it hink they could get their money back from it if they did

<PinkiePieFTW> XD
<Tovler> I want Battleship to fail so hard that MLP doesn't a fourth season due to all the losses.
<CK|Ded> For what it's worth? I've heard that Battleship does improve on a few things over Transformers....and it is worse than Transformers in several others, making it arguably worse overall.
<Dermathil> I actually hoped that Battleship would be good and most of all BE SURPRISED BY IT. But no. It was horrible.
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Monopoly movie? LOL just go visit Wall St.
<PinkiePieFTW> i would actually watch that tbh
<Cypresswolf|Spy> Hell, if they do make a FIM movie, I'll have to go to a midnight showing cause I DO NOT want to watch it surrounded by kids!

<Ponies47> *problem
<PinkiePieFTW> i liked "minesweeper" the movie.
<Dashie_Dashie> dat spitfire...
<PinkiePieFTW> from college humor.
<Dashie_Dashie> :F
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03there should be a Hungry Hungry Hippos movie~
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I heard that there was going to be a Candyland movie.
<Ponies47> NOPE.AVI
<CK|Ded> They're hungry....
<Ingwaz> hen3ry: it needs an actual plot and good acting
<CK|Ded> FOR JUSTICE
<hen3ry> "You ate my battleship!"
<Dermathil> Maid_Discord: had the videogame been a battleship turn-based strategy or an RTS it would've been potentially okay.
<Wrek|Obsermaid> 05necklace Y7N?
<PinkiePieFTW> what "the game of life" the movie.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> who here watched Code Lyoko before?
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> NOPE.AVI^10
<Shamaid> Maid_Discord...why do i want to see that
<Dashie_Dashie> Wrek: Yes
<Shamaid> Wrek|Obsermaid: yes indeed
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Adam Sandler?
<mario_pony> Maid_Discord: i don't want to live on this planet anymore
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Yesh Wrek
<RaveMaid> Wrek|Obsermaid: I like the necklace, so yes :)
<Petrified_Maid> ScootaMexiMaid: http://www.bestweekever.tv/bwe/images/2012/04/Hungry-Hungry-Hippos-Movie-Poster-1335368553.jpg
<hen3ry> Ingwaz: Hollywood forget what those words mean. Except "plot."
<pyrocatboy> Alicorn_Prince_Shane me
<CK|Ded> Yep.
<Tovler> Hi Ho Cherry-O would make for an epic movie.
<RaveMaid> Petrified_Maid: LOL!!!
<Dermathil> NEW TOPIC: Who saw the new Ghost Recon Future Soldier advert?
<PinkiePieFTW> oh, i've seen code lyoko
<CK|Ded> Candyland featuring Adam Sandler
<CK|Ded> :D
<PinkiePieFTW> but a looong while ago.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Apprentely theres a 5th season coming out this year pyrocatboy
<ScootaMexiMaid> 00,03Petrfied_Maid: OMG :D
<hen3ry> was only kidding when said "ate battleship" ...
<Dermathil> Who saw the new Ghost Recon Future Soldier trailers?
<Ponies47> Ok if Hasbro can do a Battleship movie. Don't ya'll think there will be a MLP FIM somethime in da future?
<CCCP> hai
<PinkiePieFTW> eeyup
<Ponies47> *sometime
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Hai CCCP done drawing?
<hen3ry> Probably a made for TV or direct-to-video movie. Not likely theatrical release.
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey CCCP
<Petrified_Maid> ScootaMexiMaid: /watch?v=WTSpNa06lxs
<Saturn> 08,01Ponies47: i'm hopeful
<CCCP> OmegaMaidtroidBrony: not yet, im taking a break :)
<hen3ry> Hasbro still focused on target demographic.
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> K
<CCCP> hi Ponies47
<PinkiePieFTW> when's season 3 coming out?
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Sometime in the Fall
<Ponies47> Saturn: I would think of it as a series finally
<Ingwaz> PinkiePieFTW: no news yet
<Acheron187> some point this summer
<Saturn> 08,01i think a theatrical MLP release would net them a *lot* of money
<PinkiePieFTW> hm...
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> I heard 9/15/2012 but not sure if legit
<Ingwaz> Saturn: it wouldnt make a ton, but it would be much mor ecost effective as well
<PinkiePieFTW> darn.
<Dermathil> Saturn: I actually don't really hope for a movie. Because they would probably hand the franchise to an OUTSIDER to the studios.
<mario_pony> what if the season 3 finale was a movie
<CCCP> There already is a MLP movie!
<Saturn> 08,01but then, the brony fanbase is still insignificant compared to the intended demographic fanbase, with respect to sales
<Ponies47> Saturn; I would go to see dat. I WON'T CARE IF POEPLE LAUGHED! I WUB PONIES SO WHAT!?! :[
<Dermathil> Mario_Pony: that's what Season 2 pilot and finales were for
<hen3ry> Two part episode != movie.
<Dermathil> CCCP: not that type of movie.
<Shamaid> yeah Saturn id enjoy a movie.....but i would prob be unable to go see it lol
<Ponies47> hen3ry: yeah sort of
<Saturn> 08,01Dermathil: i dunno; they might just give it a bigger budget
<CCCP> Dermathil: im taking about the g1 one
<mario_pony> Dermathil: no i mean a movie that came out in theaters
<Dermathil> hen3ry: they tried to make the 2parters as movielike as possible. But they lacked enough time to make it flow naturally. That's why they are rushed.
<Petrified_Maid> Combine Mare in the Moon and Return of Harmony and you've got yourself a FIM movie :D
<Dermathil> mario_pony: I know.
<Ponies47> CCCP: yeah I knew that. But where talking about a G4 Movie
<Dermathil> CCCP: THAT'S EXACTLY what I meant
<mario_pony> oh :P
<CCCP> Ponies47: just cut and past g4 character heads on them
<PinkiePieFTW> My Little Dashie, the movie.
<Ponies47> CCCP: HA! Still not the same
*Maid_Discord 11,01dusts PinkiePieFTW
<Petrified_Maid> PinkiePieFTW: NOOOOOOOOOOO :'(
<PinkiePieFTW> would y'all watch it?
<Dermathil> But the closest to a FIM movie we'll get will be Direct-to-DVD, CALLING IT
<CK|Ded> Dermathil: The S2 finale is as close to a made-for-TV-movie as they've gotten so far
<Dermathil> CK|Ded: I said that already. Before it that title went to Return of Harmony.
<CK|Ded> And it did a darn good job of it, actually.
<Dermathil> I know that stuff.
<PinkiePieFTW> not direct-to-dvd, derm
<Ponies47> PinkiePieFTW: NOI WOULD CRY! :'( I'VE REED THE 1ST AND THE 2ND I CRIED AT BOTH! :'(
<PinkiePieFTW> maybe made for tv
<CCCP> A documantary on cloppers?
<Saturn> 08,01the thing i'd hope for with an MLP movie is enough budget to use a *real* orchestra for the music
<Saturn> 08,01instea of just synths
<LittleBrony> PinkiePieFTW: Evample of what would happen:Brony:I AM A TRUE MAN! After my little dashie movie:I FEEL DEAD ON THE INSIDE!
<PinkiePieFTW> i've read the 1st, but i don't want to read the second
<teh_Tharassan> Damn the drawing is looking sexy, wish i could draw that good my drawing suck compared to this
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> CCCP that is a terrible Idea
<Dermathil> Saturn: don't want Ingram? BLASPHEMY
<Cypresswolf|Spy> But this fanbase has grown significantly since I got in it - Houston's first brony meetup had barely 12 show up - the meet up at the season finally had well over 100! That's a HUGE difference - and I found a brony con in Austin in september :) This fandom is too big to be "insignificant"
<CCCP> OmegaMaidtroidBrony: hahahaha
<Ingwaz> Dermathil: if its a legitmate mlp:fim direct to dvd movie, i'd buy it day one
<Om> A real Orchestra would be fantastic
<Saturn> 08,01Dermathil: i never said that!
<PinkiePieFTW> I cried a single tear reading dashie
<Dermathil> BUT YOU DID
<PinkiePieFTW> when the guy was reading dashie's letter
<LittleBrony> ^
<PinkiePieFTW> it really got me.
<Dermathil> YOU SAID REAL ORCHESTRA INSTEAD OF SYNTHS
<Ponies47> Ok I'm just wondering after reading My Little Dashie did you cry?
<Dermathil> SYNTHS ARE BY INGRAM
<Saturn> 08,01Dermathil: yes
<Saturn> 08,01synths are orchestral synths
<Dermathil> THEREFORE REAL ORCHESTRA INSTEAD OF INGRAM
*Petrified_Maid cried no tears after reading My Little Dashie. Which only made it worse :'(
<Ponies47> It's ok
<Ingwaz> Dermathil: ingram is a songwriter/composer
<Saturn> 08,01Dermathil: i don't think you really get how the scoring process workks
<Ingwaz> not a musician
<PinkiePieFTW> i'm actually a really misty eyed person...
<Dermathil> Saturn: ;P
<Saturn> 08,01i doubt that daniel ingram even orchestrates the music
<PinkiePieFTW> i cry easy when watching movies/tv or reading books
*OmegaMaidtroidBrony had nothing to contribute so he sits back and watches
<Ingwaz> i believe thats what steffan andrews does isnt it
<CCCP> What about MOVIE.MOV?
<PinkiePieFTW> lol
<Ingwaz> CCCP: NO
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHAH CCP
<Saturn> 08,01he probably churns out a song on piano, and gets someone else to orchestrate it
<PinkiePieFTW> i would soooo watch that.
<mario_pony> PinkiePieFTW: lol same
<CCCP> :3
<Saturn> 08,01but i'm not sure
<PinkiePieFTW> that would be awesome...
<CCCP> Ingwaz: :3
<PinkiePieFTW> Movie.mov... ohh god that needs to happen...
<Dermathil> Saturn: if it was the case we'd have heard anything about them by now
<Ingwaz> CCCP: you're dangerous, i must end your life for the safety of bronies everywhere
<CCCP> PinkiePieFTW: ikr
*Ingwaz knifes CCCP
<Googer12> Hello again.
*Dermathil punches Ingwaz
<RyunosukeKnT> you know... whoever had the ingenious idea of releasing both the battleship movie on the same weekend as the Avengers, and the video game on the same weekend as D3, there is no hell good enough for that kind of double epic failure
<Dermathil> DON'T TOUCH CCCP
<EpicPwnTime3> bai gotta go!
<CCCP> Ingwaz: et tu brute?
*CCCP dies
<Shamaid> cya EpicPwnTime3
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Bai EpicPwnTime3
*Ingwaz touches CCCP in ALL THE RIGHT PLACES
<Ingwaz> giggity
<PinkiePieFTW> there's a battleship game?
<CCCP> O_O
<Dermathil> RyunosukeKnT: you mean on the same DAY as Diablo 3?
<OtakuTom> So yea...I just watched the Angry Joe review...I love it when he gets that pissed off XD
<Googer12> I'm back again.
<twilight_sprinkler> CCCP: wow what a classy way to die
<CCCP> bye EpicPwnTime3
<EpicPwnTime3> Next time, we eat SPITFIRE!
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkler: ikr
<RyunosukeKnT> true Dermathil
<PinkiePieFTW> (other than the boardgame, obviously)
<mario_pony> Ingwaz: lol :D
<Wrek|Obsermaid> 05wow
<Dermathil> PinkiePieFTW: yes. it is a 4-hour long FPS priced at 60$
<Wrek|Obsermaid> 05ive been going on for long :o
<Cypresswolf|Spy> I need to check what other movies are in right now - a double feature of lesser movies sounds pretty good right now
<PinkiePieFTW> hm...
<RyunosukeKnT> OtakuTom: I have seen him angrier
<Shamaid> Wrek|Obsermaid: just a little..
<PinkiePieFTW> well, movie games suck anyways.
<RyunosukeKnT> barely
<RAWRity> http://derpy.me/eejTt
<Dermathil> you know, as in FIRST PERSON SHOOTER
<Maid_Discord> 11,01Dermathil: Did you buy the game?
<OtakuTom> Well yea...but it's still fun to see him that angry...lol
<Dermathil> No.
<CCCP> RAWRity: LOLOLOL
<Dermathil> Angry Joe did
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey Glacymr
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Shamaid> RAWRity: nick cage is best all around actor...
<CK|Ded> Who would buy that game? Angry Joe, and ONLY Angry Joe. :p
<Ponies47> After I reed My Little Dashie I felt like Pinkie Pie in Babycakes when she cryed :'(
<RAWRity> Dermathil: I saw that review. Twas funny
<Saturn> 08,01Dermathil: aye, looks like i'm wrong; he does orchestrate the songs himself
<WallDives> hello all again.
<PinkiePieFTW> lol
<Dermathil> TOLD YA SO SATURN
<Saturn> 08,01but the difference would be in the performance, not the writing
<CK|Ded> I was surprised he didn't go lower, though.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01I saw a Giant Bomb playthrough.
<PinkiePieFTW> reading my little dashie is like a right of passage for becoming a brony.
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey WallDives guy stay outta my shed
<RyunosukeKnT> I have seen Joe angrier
<CCCP> hi WallDives
<WallDives> Ponies47: bah to you and your shed.
<RyunosukeKnT> See: Sword of the Stars 2, Mass Effect 3
<RAWRity> So, newest ep of YOung Justice was...a lot of stalling followed by 30 seconds of infodump.
<CK|Ded> 2/10 seems high for a 4-hour experience that pretty much just functions.
<Dermathil> Giant Bomb did a First Impressions? OH DAMN I WANT TO SEE IT
<PinkiePieFTW> have any of you guys taken the ultimate brony challenge?
<Saturn> 08,01i'd *love* to here Ingram and William Anderson's music with a real orchestra
<Ponies47> PinkiePieFTW: Lesson Zero was the path I choose
<CCCP> Saturn: that would be cool
<Ponies47> WallDives; Okie doki loki
<RyunosukeKnT> he was... less than thrilled with ME3 ending
<Cypresswolf|Spy> Dark Shadows & Battleship - hows that for a double feature?
<OtakuTom> I'll be taking on the ultimate brony challenge soon...once I have a couple days off of work and I can afford to be up for that long.
<Maid_Discord> 11,01PinkiePieFTW: Watching MLP straight w/o sleeping?
<PinkiePieFTW> yeah
<PinkiePieFTW> both seasons
<SilverSonic> !weather Chicago

<PinkiePieFTW> nonstop
<CCCP> I watched every episode in chronological order
<PinkiePieFTW> i'm gonna do it with some friends eventually
<RustyMeat> what
<Maid_Discord> 11,01With my sleeping issues, I could do that easily.
<Dermathil> CK|Ded: no it is actually accurate. Most reviewers would've given it a 5/10 because it is not good enough for a 6 but is better than some titles that were rated 3. (But it deserves 2 because of the USELESS rating inflation)
<SilverSonic> !warriorcats
<Cypresswolf|Spy> the other movies in my nearest theatre - except for the Dictator, are even worse than Battleship sounds
<Ponies47> I watched every episode that was out at the time when I became a brony NON-STOP!
<Pinkies4thWall> PinkiePieFTW: you're a better brony than I
<SparklyWaffles> I'm playing Amnesia... I'm really asking for a Nightmare lol
<PinkiePieFTW> i haven't done it yet...
<ZetaMaidtroidBrony> Damn serverdisconnect
<PinkiePieFTW> but mark my words
<SilverSonic> !warriorcats Chicago
<CCCP> SparklyWaffles are you blue?
<PinkiePieFTW> i'll do it before I enlist
<Maid_Discord> 11,016/10 is like the minimum for reviewer ratings now.
<Ponies47> You do the pony pokie
<CK|Ded> Dermathil: But Joe doesn't have that. Joe typically rates things with a real scale, with 5-6 being average. So 2 is high for this considering his prior reviews.
<RAWRity> Ah yes, Game Review ratings. Where anything below 8/10 means it's AWFUL, but the publishers are being paid to promote it.
<Cypresswolf|Spy> SparklyWaffles: have you played any Amnesia mod levels yet?
<BlueFlare> 02oh, now it's just cats
<Maid_Discord> 11,018/10 if the reviewer is paid-off.

<Maid_Discord> 11,01Gotta love Audioslave.

<SparklyWaffles> :o

<CK|Ded> ....really?
<Cypresswolf|Spy> Dermathil: I saw Avenger's last night

<Cypresswolf|Spy> Awesome!
<PinkiePieFTW> avengers was sooo funny.
<BlueFlare> 02it thinks that any script that begins with w is the weather script
<Ponies47> eeyup
*Maid_Discord 11,01cleans SparklyWaffles and makes him super purple.
<PinkiePieFTW> hulk was hilarious
<CK|Ded> To be honest I wasn't fond of Burton's versions of Alice or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
<Dermathil> RAWRity: I heard it is funny. I am actually tempted to see it.
<Cypresswolf|Spy> I loved Hulk's surprise left on Thor :D
<CK|Ded> So....to imagine films I like less than those....ew.
<SparklyWaffles> ANNOUNCEMENT: I'M. A. GIRL.
<PinkiePieFTW> when he interupts loki's speech?
<PinkiePieFTW> best. scene. ever.
<Ponies47> Dermathil: GO SO IT! :[
<RAWRity> SparklyWaffles: NOT ANYMORE
<WallDives> SparklyWaffles: ...and?
<CCCP> AND?
<ZetaMaidtroidBrony> Kinda already knew SparklyWaffles
<CK|Ded> PinkiePieFTW: PUNY GOD.
<CCCP> RAWRity: lol
<SparklyWaffles> O NO
*Pinkies4thWall breaks into many pieces. PINKIE!
*RAWRity declares SparklyWaffles officila Male of Bronystate
<OtakuTom> I liked Alice, but the preivews turned me away from Charlie, so I never saw that one.
<ZetaMaidtroidBrony> LD
<Cypresswolf|Spy> Stan Lee cameo made me laugh too
<SparklyWaffles> X'D
<ZetaMaidtroidBrony> *:D
<SparklyWaffles> Very well
<WallDives> you are you, your gender doesnt matter unless you're trying to be shipped.
<PinkiePieFTW> he cameos in every movie.
<Dermathil> Ponies47: can't really these days.
<PinkiePieFTW> i like him in fantastic four 2
<WallDives> and even then, it doesnt really matter.
<CCCP> I dont like pretty much any new tim burton films
<RyunosukeKnT> that doesnt stop otakon :)
<ZetaMaidtroidBrony> lol
<Dermathil> PinkiePieFTW: He was in the 2003 Hulk.
<Shamaid> Cypresswolf|Spy...heros in my city....ha your crazy
*WallDives shrugs.
<Ponies47> Dermathil; Well when you get the chance. Watch it.
<ZetaMaidtroidBrony> Otakon, shipped so much there's a song
<Cypresswolf|Spy> ^ YES! ^_^
<PinkiePieFTW> yeah, all marvel movies.
<CK|Ded> But Ryun, that's because Otakon Ships With Everything.

<Maid_Discord> 11,01Why is Maid Hour almost up?

<Ponies47> The Avengers is best Marvel Comic's movie! Next to Spiderman 2
<Derpy_Hooves> i missed it ; A;
<CK|Ded> He's the BronyState version of Guile's Theme.
<mario_pony> CCCP: did you finish those errands?
<Shamaid> Maid_Discord: cause.....time has to progress
<ZetaMaidtroidBrony> Because time is a douche Maid_Discord
*Pinkies4thWall is broken and requires cleaning up or somebody could get hurt. Maid_Discord, help me?
<PinkiePieFTW> spoiler alert for the avengers: snape kills dumbledore.
<twilight_sprinkler> Maid_Discord: we can make this maid day
<Dermathil> Ugh. I still need to punch the idiot who thought it was a good idea to force the otakonship on bronystate. It should've been met like every time someone tries to force a meme on 4chan.
*Maid_Discord 11,01cleans Pinkies4thWall
