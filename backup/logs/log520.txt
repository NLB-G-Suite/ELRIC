<Stallion_of_War> MFW I realized why Fleur was named Fleur - http://i50.tinypic.com/rac4te.jpg
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: now wait a tic, I care!
<WindWhistler> And I can't find the receipts either...
<WindWhistler> I'll just keep looking until I crack.
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: is there anywhere else in the house they might be at? Maybe they were moved around for cleaning?
<Wrek> 05well if you cant muster to relink it, then why botehr asking again if i am goign to draw it? it gives the signal that you do not wish for me to draw it
<TOY_PON32> MahBoi777: I'm thinking of a number between 1 - 10
<WindWhistler> Sylandest: We looked everywhere. The Wii games were reorganized, but we looked there already.
<WindWhistler> It was with the Wii games.
<WindWhistler> And the 3DS game...I have no idea...
<WindWhistler> It's probably thrown out or crushed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do. I'm just talking out of depression, frustration, and other negative things.
<drf-Droid> heh, even in Japanese, Kyubey sounds like a girl
<WindWhistler> This is hopeless.
<TOY_PON32> God dammit MahBoi777..
<Wrek> 05i have 10 ish minutes
<Wrek> 05let me atleast sketch something
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: if it was with the wii games and resorted, then look where the things that didnt fit with the wii games went
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON32: is it 7?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/803/h51gz.jpg/ <- Here.
*TOY_PON32 is dying of boredom
<TOY_PON32> MahBoi777: No 3
<WindWhistler> Sylandest: We did. We did all that. We looked in my room, we looked in the computer room, we looking in the family room. Everywhere.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, I didn't want to push it because I didn't want to annoy you, but I'm in a niffy mood so here.
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON32: Lol it's k
<WindWhistler> All these figures I have are now useless. I just wasted $300.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I act fucking weird under depression.
<Irish_Pony> :D
<TOY_PON32> MahBoi777: Now you ask me
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: what about spare bags or maybe folders?
<Ponies47> BRB :p
<TOY_PON32> Nittany_Discord: It's okay. We're not bothering you
*Irish_Pony hugs Nittany_Discord
<WindWhistler> Sylandest: Like I said, already looked. Now I have $300 down the drain.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I feel like I'm bothering Wrek.
*MahBoi777 is confuzzled
<Ninjazz> Don't we all, Nittany_Discord?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No-one here is causing it.
<TOY_PON32> Okay.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> hmm?
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: no your not :( *hugs*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's just compounding real-life bullshit.
<TOY_PON32> :(
<WindWhistler> I'll go back to looking even though I'm never gonna find it...
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: dont give up yet. When do you think they vanished?
<Om> so Ninjazz, How has your vacation been so far?
<Ninjazz> Om: Tiring.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Don't worry
<CrimsonPhoenix> about a thing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And feeling somewhat abandoned because I'm not getting the help I want moving home.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cause everylittle thing
<CrimsonPhoenix> is gonna be alright
<Om> Ninjazz: Not even a litle bit fun?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No-one at home is helping me with anything.
<CrimsonPhoenix> So how's everyone?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My mom didn't even help promote my charity drive.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01She instead wanted me to ask for money.
<WindWhistler> Sylandest: A few months ago.
<MahBoi777> hey CrimsonPhoenix! doin good
<TOY_PON32> Nittany_Discord: That's terrible
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Which I found very selfish.
<WindWhistler> And I can't look anymore. I do not have the energy.
<WindWhistler> I'm just gonna sit here and be depressed.
<Sylandest> WindWhistler: oooh...bugger, thats not good. I was gonna say check trash if it was recent, but...darn. I'm sorry :(
<WindWhistler> Maybe I'll go emo.
<TOY_PON32> ...
<Yahooz> over 300 dollars?
<Dken2021> ...
<Ninjazz> Om: Now that I've gotten into my hotel room it is, before while I was traveling for 20 hours was rather... unfun. And I'm bloody tired right now.
<MahBoi777> don go emo
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs WindWhistler
<Yahooz> thats a bit extreme
<CrimsonPhoenix> woa there what IS going on in here?
<WindWhistler> Yahooz: $300 is a lot. Especially on one game.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wouldn't spend it.
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: damn.....hope ya sleep well tonight:S
<Yahooz> WindWhistler: you bought two copies though, no?
<Om> Ninjazz: I'm kinda tired. But nothing like you must be feeling.
<CrimsonPhoenix> what game?
<WindWhistler> I have 25 figures for a game I don't even have.
*Sylandest hugs WindWhistler "I'm sorry"
<WindWhistler> Yahooz: Yeah. One for Wii and one for 3DS. I lost them both.
<Videofreak1127[M]> Gotta figure out how to type in japanese on this browser
<TOY_PON32> Well guys, I'm gonna be a senior in high school. I'm pretty damn excited about it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wii 3DS?
<Yahooz> so let me rephrase that
<Ninjazz> Om: I'm used to it... But it's just odd seeing the sun still up so many times in one day.
<CrimsonPhoenix> What game?
<Dken2021> TOY_PON32 congrats
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: It's for multiple consoles.
<Bunny_Maid_Luna> Anybody doing request? :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> What game?
<Ninjazz> Congrats, TOY_PON32! :)
<Yahooz> go emo over an expensive game?
<TOY_PON32> Dken2021: Thanks :)
<TOY_PON32> Thanks Ninjazz
<Yahooz> TOY_PON32: same here
<WindWhistler> To make things worse, I can't simply replace the game.
<MahBoi777> congrats TOY_PON32
<Ninjazz> Of course. :)
<Glacymr> rawr
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> WindWhistler i guess you could look for a used copy, so you don't have to pay full price
<CrimsonPhoenix> WHAT GAME
<WindWhistler> The game comes with three figures.
<TOY_PON32> Yahooz: Awesome!
<Om> Ninjazz: That would be fun.
<TOY_PON32> Thanks MahBoi777
<Om> Ninjazz: I mean odd :S
*VioletGreySha jumps on Ninjazz
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01WindWhistler: You can ask the company or the store for a replacement?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Please don't tell me Skylanders
<WindWhistler> Nittany_Discord: I'd need the receipt. I can't find it.
<DeathStar> good afternoon everypony
<Dken2021> hey DeathStar
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ouch.
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF will love madcoke
<Ninjazz> Om: Coming to the states always has its price, but I'm more worried about having a good connection to get to here.
<WindWhistler> Unless I went over and showed them all the figures I had. Maybe they'd take pity on me.
<Prick> ok everytime i tab out i see Wrek working on his "main" potrait...then i see em doing another sketch and i know he's not done with the main...is this like an idea burst of a sketch (draw it right away before its gone?)
<Dken2021> WindWhistler so you lost a game?
<drf-Droid> LOL what makes you say that
<MahBoi777> good afternoon DeathStar!
<drf-Droid> so far it's weird
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: And rendered 25 figures useless.
<CrimsonPhoenix> WHAT GAME?
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder if the dubbed version
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Skylanders.
<TOY_PON32> brb gotta download an app
<vitrus> I just found this site, what goes on here exactly?
<HyperMetalLugia> is the one with all the stupid retarded edita
<HyperMetalLugia> edits
<drf-Droid> no
<WindWhistler> Those figures cost $10 each.
<HyperMetalLugia> that include changing lighting and adding gore
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
<drf-Droid> it's a dual audio DVD
<CrimsonPhoenix> You want to play it?
<drf-Droid> so has both languages
<Sumica> 00,10did I lose sound or is the music gone?
<drf-Droid> :P
<DeathStar> Prick: maybe or maybe he got sick of the main one that happens some times too
<HyperMetalLugia> Great
<HyperMetalLugia> :v
<WindWhistler> So I have $250 worth of figures for a game I can't even play.
<Dken2021> WindWhistler did you check paces you don't normally go to?
<drf-Droid> o.o

<ponibas|D3> Please use English in here
<Ninjazz> Hey there, DeathStar.
<WindWhistler> I'd have to get the figures too.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that's good enough, I just stated my opinion on the game
<Ponies47> Back :P
<drf-Droid> I prefer PAW's animation style
<Dken2021> Videofreak1127[M] you must be using google translate
<drf-Droid> so far
<WindWhistler> Dken2021: I don't remember. I last played it a few months ago.

<IDAS> Rain: still not racism
<xmasskills> IDAS: i have no idea but if it exists america is better than it YEAAAAA
<Vordox> Phase4: I KNOW RIGHT
*Phase4 00,02hugs Rain

<Rain> screw this, Im out
<FairysHuff> Well this conversation topic is boring.
<Mutterguy> Well i don't consider my nationality a race and the only reason we shag the sheep is because that's the only thing Australia won't resort to stealing
<OtakuTom> UDK is kinda clunky. I had to use it for a game dev coure I was just in. It should hopefully get better once Unreal Engine 4 is out.
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, you wouldnt happen to know how would you?
<alexxm> http://verydemotivational.memebase.com/2012/06/05/demotivational-posters-reassurance/
<Vordox> Phase4: Windowed mode?

<Firelight> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbKwIYgpzU <--- pony rock tyme! Also last thing I'm goign to do tonight.. so watch it!!!
<Vordox> You could play the engine with a play command, it should become windowed then
<Vordox> If you extract it into an exe, it'll probably go fullscreen
<IDAS> Mutterguy: NOW THATS RACIST

<Meanwhile> Bye MasterBoss43.
<Phase4> 00,02BrOnyxia, i know
<BrOnyxia> :)
<dshannon> XD
<alexxm> bey MasterBoss43
<diddutz> BrOnyxia: SOME of them?
<Vordox> FUN FACT HERE GUS
<Vordox> 60 Kilo Safe + Kid on a trampoline = Too heavy, A kid STANDING on the safe THEN on a trampoline = Change of mass.
<BrOnyxia> diddutz: except the free steam games for ati and nvidia cards
<Vordox> MY HEAD IS TOO LOGOCAL FOR THIS
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: it looks like he turns that nice and heavy safe into styrofoam
<diddutz> BrOnyxia: okay, that might be legit
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: But the kid is a constant
<BrOnyxia> diddutz: :3
<Dark_Horst> that kind of fucks it, indeed
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Lighty10) 11WB10»11•. 10- i sooo love e-mail, i win atleast 5 cars everyday
<diddutz> Vordox: yeah, i noticed that, too
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Thank you, if SCIENCE, THINK SCIENCE; not THINK SCIENCE but stop gibberishing :P
<Dark_Horst> maybe it'S MAGIC styrofoam
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: There IS an explanation to it
<diddutz> Mystery solved => ITS MAGIC!
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: His SELF is the same,but his mass changes...but why MUST he stand on items to changemass instead of standing alone?
<Vordox> URGh
<Meanwhile> Erryday ahm shovelin
<BrOnyxia> LOL
<Vordox> THESE REFERENCES ARE TOO BLUNT
<Dark_Horst> Vordox: but that's how we like em
<BrOnyxia> oh god lol
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: I prefer a subtle thought then a subtle blunt smack to the face
<Meanwhile> You'll get a blunt smack to the face and you'll like it.
<Vordox> Hai Ike
<Vordox> Meanwhile: NEVAH unless it's erotical nature :P
<Meanwhile> Pfft
<Irish_Pony> So basically this game is about shapes and bouncing :P
<Vordox> Irish_Pony: Science but not science
<Phase4> 00,02you see
<Phase4> 00,02this here
<Phase4> 00,02is why portal worked soo well at valve
<Irish_Pony> :D
<Vordox> Phase4: Too easy?
<BrOnyxia> its about gravity generally i guess
<Phase4> 00,02too fiddly
<Phase4> 00,02its easy to figure
<Irish_Pony> I can tell :D
<Phase4> 00,02hard to execute
<Phase4> 00,02the figuring part is fun
<Vordox> Phase4: We're about 25 seconds behind
<Phase4> 00,02THAT is what people enjoy
<Dark_Horst> now imagine how this game woud look like if it had portals too
<Phase4> 00,02dats a bit of lag
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, brains might explode
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: ya..."people" :P
<alexxm> its sort of like portal but with more garvity
<Vordox> Phase4: Heard of Crayon Physics deluxe?
<Phase4> 00,02the other problem is some of these platforms are a little fidgity
<Dark_Horst> and without portals
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: Dimension s.P
<Dark_Horst> multiverse
<Irish_Pony> Cave Johnston would be very dissapoint with this lab :/
<Phase4> 00,02i have now
<Phase4> 00,02dis game needs a little polish
<Vordox> Crayon Physics deluxe. <3 So fun and easy, except...err...yeah :P
<Dark_Horst> btw, this you should see
<Dark_Horst> http://9gag.com/gag/3013872
<Phase4> 00,02portal was actualy quite a large change to the source engin
<Phase4> 00,02engine'
<Phase4> 00,02to suport the portals
<Dark_Horst> must've been hell on his CPU
<Vordox> Phase4: Indeed, it was a fun change of pace. :P
<Phase4> 00,02this is unmodified unreal engine, which is primaraly an fps engine
<Vordox> but ti was more about the personas then the easy puzzles(Imo)
<BrOnyxia> Phase4: they created lots of new ents with portal 2 release
<Phase4> 00,02new tools too
<BrOnyxia> yar
<Phase4> 00,02theres the invisible portals that make stitching together levels easy
<Vordox> LAWL
<Phase4> 00,02and irational spaces posible
<Vordox> DAT PORTAL IMAGE
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma stop after getting this reactor going
<Phase4> 00,02want to eat, and dont want to spoil the entire thing
<Vordox> Phase4: Try out Crayon Physics deluxe. :P It's a very slow pace physics game
<Vordox> You need to get it though through...some measures.
<diddutz> yeah those world portals can make level design very fun ^^
<BrOnyxia> those divide by zzero jokes
<Vordox> Phase4: The vats NEED TO be fluffy?
<alexxm> off for lunch back soon
<Phase4> 00,02everything needs to be fluffy
<Irish_Pony> aw so close
<Vordox> You need to make it heavy in mid air?
<Phase4> 00,02OK
<Phase4> 00,02in the top
<Phase4> 00,02invisible walls on the sides
<Irish_Pony> -_-
<Vordox> 2 more :P
<BrOnyxia> wow stream is behind
<Meanwhile> Stream is always behind.,
<Dark_Horst> oh, this one's going to be a bitch
<Vordox> Phase4: Feck up the game, bu placing safe AND vat on same bounce = P
<Dark_Horst> aaaand slamdunk

<Sylandest> oni_link: I'm doing well, hehe. I'm currently nomming breakfast before work. How about you?
<DarkStar> Im good, playing some Reach
<Irish_Pony> "A girl goes into the past and kills her Grandmother. Since her Grandmother is dead, the girl was never born. If she were never born, she never killed her grandmother." dat logic
<oni_link> Sylandest: Breakfast eh, what are you having?
<oni_link> DarkStar: Ooh Reach, I love that game :)
<Sylandest> oni_link: poptarts, banana, and milk :3
<DarkStar> Halo FTFW!
<Irish_Pony> Halo 4 =_=
<Irish_Pony> oh and btw theres gonna be ANOTHER Gears of War
<Sylandest> Irish_Pony: aye, i heard about that
<DarkStar> I cant wait for Halo 4, its gonna be EPIC!!!!
<oni_link> Sylandest: Sounds pretty good :) I just came back from having an early breakfast with some of my friends out in a diner. I had pancakes with bluberry syrup!
<Sylandest> oni_link: lucky! I didn't have time to fix more for breakfast...:D
<oni_link> DarkStar: I know, I was like shut up and take my money Microsoft!!
<Sylandest> the stream lives
<Meanwhile> Halo. Meh.
<oni_link> Sylandest: Well at least what you did prepare is tasty! I'm stuffed :P
<DarkStar> oni_link whats ur gamer tag?
<Sylandest> oni_link: hehehe, its enough for now, i suppose
<Phase4> 00,02stream working?
<Sylandest> Phase4: aye!
<killerpony7733> Phase4: yes
<Kandarihu> It's good so far
<oni_link> DarkStar:xoRETRIBUTIONox
<DarkStar> Ill add ya
<Kandarihu> Hmm, right after I said that, I got a buffer circle
<oni_link> Sylandest: Then you should have an even better lunch!!
<oni_link> Phase4 stream time whoo!!
<Sylandest> oni_link: I hope to, lol. It depends on how work goes and what I'm hungry for :D
<Phase4> 00,02one of the 4x crates is worth a lot
<Phase4> 00,02anyone know which?
<oni_link> Sylandest: Haha well lets hope you're extra productive today then :)
<diddutz> there is a page on the tf2 wiki telling you how are the chances of getting ehich item, for each crate series, they might say something
<oni_link> DarkStar: sweet my xbox is in the other room though :D
<DarkStar> Oh, Ill still add you though
<Sylandest> oni_link: I usually am, lol. The only thing with it is that its a long shift. I usually finish my tasks within the first few hours
<Irish_Pony> I never did get how this website worked :S
<oni_link> DarkStar: what other games do you have? and awesome, I need more XBL brony buds!
<oni_link> Sylandest: Ah, and then you're just trying to look busy the rest of the day huh?
<Sylandest> oni_link: kinda sorta, ehehe. Helping to run a trade shop means the day depends on what folk bring in to trade or sell. I am sincerely hoping for an easy day
<DarkStar> Ive got a larrge veriety of games oni_link
<oni_link> Sylandest: I bet you meet all sorts of people though. Im usually stuck in a warehouse all day and I finish shipping off online orders in a matter of hours. Then I spend the rest of the work day playing NES games at my work station :D
<Irish_Pony> well screw it Im gonna go play TF2
<oni_link> DarkStar: Well do you have MW3 and Future Soldier?
<Sylandest> oni_link: I is so jelly...:D. The folk I meet aren't always pleasant. Many of them are folk who are looking for nothing more than a quick buck for gas or something. And even then, I can't take half of what they trade in
<alexxm> so did phase4 finish that game
<alexxm> is the chat dead
<Phase4> 00,02i'm not doing so well
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, nope
<alexxm> thanks Phase4
<Sylandest> we're all just sorta chillin...XD
<alexxm> good good
<Sylandest> Phase4: that pyro is sure causing trouble for you, lol
<alexxm> kill the pyro
<oni_link> Sylandest: Ouch but the problem with my job is that its all based orders. If there aren't any orders then usually that means there isn't work for me for the rest of that week. And also I get paid by the ammount of orderes shipped . Like this week I only worked Monday through Wednesday. :(
<Phase4> 00,02ragequit that server
<oni_link> LOL
<Koen> 4hey
<IDAS> Phase4: Rage quittting like a bawss
<oni_link> I play the poorman's TF2 on XBL cause I'm PC less...
<Sylandest> oni_link: ahhh, I see. That is a bit of a troublesome job. Mine's a pay by the hour job, usually in 8 hour shifts. Its good money for now, since most of what I earn goes towards college
<alexxm> oni_link i'm sure you'll get more work soon
<BroKnee> Mornin everypony ^-^
<Sylandest> morning, BroKnee!
<oni_link> alexxm: thanks and I hope I do. I really wanna just find a better job. So far no luck.
<IDAS> night all :D :P
<Sylandest> night, IDAS
<alexxm> hey BroKnee what have you been up to
<BroKnee> Night IDAS
<alexxm> bye IDAS
<Sylandest> oni_link: what sorta job would you want to have?
<oni_link> Sylandest: I gotta go back to college :P
<IDAS> BroKnee: nice name lol
<BroKnee> alexxm Sleep xD
<BroKnee> IDAS Ty :3
<oni_link> Sylandest: I'm not really picky, as long as I get paid weekly and by the hour. I'll take what I can get :D
<alexxm> why not have a army of havies with one medic between them
<Sylandest> oni_link: I still got 2 more years to go through before I'm done, lol. And thats a good mentality for work
<Sylandest> alexxm: because the heavies can usually be outgunned or outmanuvered by soldiers or scouts, let alone engineer turrets
<alexxm> good point Sylandest
<oni_link> Sylandest: Awesome, what's your major?
<Sylandest> oni_link: English major, focus in literature, with a minor in Sociology
<oni_link> Sylandest: Ah, so you plan on teaching?
<Sylandest> oni_link: pfffft, I would make a bad teacher...:D. No, I seek to be a writer/author. I love to write stories, so its what I want to do more than anything
<oni_link> Sylandest: Wow, thats great :) I love kids but I don't think I can handle teaching em either :D
<BroKnee> I feel young now O.o
<killerpony7733> BroKnee: why?
<BroKnee> killerpony7733 They are talking about college and I'm 14 xD
<Sylandest> oni_link: my brother intended to go into teaching and even managed to get his teaching degree. He came home a couple weeks ago and said "I do not want to teach anymore". I guess the kids he had to work with to get his degree broke him
<Sylandest> BroKnee: I'm not old...I'm only 20...T.T
<killerpony7733> BroKnee: Ah i see i'm 17 and only less then 2 months till i turn 18
<BroKnee> I still feel young now xD
<oni_link> Sylandest: I'm 20 too :D
<Sylandest> oni_link: 20 yr olds ftw! /) :D
<oni_link> Broknee: Enjoy that feel while you can!
<oni_link> Sylandest: (\ right back at ya! :D
<FalonSquirreltamer> whats so awesome about beeing 20?^^ in amerika its like beeing 15 in germany :P
<Sylandest> dat random music...
<BroKnee> oni_link I don't like being young :p
<Sylandest> FalonSquirreltamer: its the age thats right before you turn 21! :D
<alexxm> i'm 18
<FalonSquirreltamer> me too
<oni_link> FalonSquirreltamer: I want to be you right now :o Germany and Japan are my two favorite places
<BroKnee> I hear 21 is the best age in America >.>
<oni_link> BroKnee: it is, I count down the days til I'm 21
<FalonSquirreltamer> sure i can drive smoke and drink but i cant see most videos on youtube^^
<Sylandest> BroKnee: yeah, it usually is, lol. It grants full legal adulthood.
<BroKnee> oni_link I'm going to Tokyo with a groupof friends when I'm 18
<BroKnee> oni_link Sylandest xD Wowzerz
<BroKnee> Well, I'mah get on TF2 now

<alexxm> enjoy yourself BroKnee
<oni_link> FalonSquirreltamer: really? :D
<FalonSquirreltamer> oni_link: yeah and all games are censored
<diddutz> i wonder how many people have started playing tf2 just because they saw it here ...
<alexxm> when i turned 18 me and a friend went to tennireffe and went clubbing for a week
<Sylandest> diddutz: plenty, im sure, lol
<oni_link> FalonSquirreltamer: Yikes, I always used to lie when I made profiles for websites :D
<FalonSquirreltamer> me too but still^^ like in l4d when i kill someone they just fade
<FalonSquirreltamer> killing tons of undead.. aaaand they are gone^^
<dr-whooves> OMIGOSHOMIGOSHOMIGOSH GUESS WHAT!
<oni_link> FalonSquirreltamer: is that an age restriction thing or is it like a parental setting?
<oni_link> FalonSquirreltamer: i meant age restriction or region restriction
<FalonSquirreltamer> oni_link: ist just the german version
<Sylandest> dr-whooves: what?
<oni_link> dr-whooves: whaaatt??? D:
<FalonSquirreltamer> thats why i buy all the awesome games from austria or thailand
<alexxm> what happened dr-whooves

<FalonSquirreltamer> oni_link: just a stupid thing when you buy them on steam
<Sylandest> oni_link: I will try :D
<oni_link> Sylandest: alright then, take care!
<oni_link> FalonSquirreltamer: I wish region coding and altering didn't exist :(
<Ninjazz> Hello Everyone

<OverGrownPegasus10> I know dat feel bro.
<Pegasister> Hello Everypony!<3
<FalonSquirreltamer> good afternoon Crono
<FalonSquirreltamer> and Pegasister ^^
<oni_link> OvergrownPegasus10: /)
<oni_link> hello Crono_brony and Pegasister
<Phase4> 00,02i have very little to do
<alexxm> hey Crono_brony and Pegasister how have your days been
<Crono_brony> alexxm: I've been doing great! Thanks for asking! ^^
<oni_link> Phase4: Javascript for pros? I am intrigued
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, http://weepy.github.com/kaffeine/
<Phase4> 00,02looks usefull
<JRP2234[Web]> Phase4: y u no play
<|Discord|> He has ze things to do
<Meanwhile> I had a neat little streak going there.
<Meanwhile> Although I kept mistaking Pinkie's sound effects for my chat ping.
<OverGrownPegasus10> XD
<Vordox> YAY!
<alexxm> this game looks intreasting
<OverGrownPegasus10> This reminds me of another game
<Vordox> Phase4: Good luck Phase. THINK SCIENCE AND PHYSICS
<DarkStar> Is Pincess Luna here?
<killerpony7733> Draw stuff....seems legit
<Vordox> Remember, Mass, Gravity, Centrifucal, Pedal, ALL of it
<alexxm> sort of like that ds game with the words expect with pictures
<OverGrownPegasus10> DRAW DERPY!
<oni_link> alexxm: scribblenauts?
<alexxm> yeah oni_link
<Vordox> alexxm: Crayon Physics Deluxe.
<Vordox> :P
<OverGrownPegasus10> Seriously, this game is way too familar
<Vordox> alexxm: Oh wait, yeah derp on me, my bad.^^
<OverGrownPegasus10> Even the music
<Meanwhile> I think played some of this once.
<Meanwhile> I got bored pretty fast.
<Vordox> It starts easy...
<Vordox> VERY easy but once you get to the pedalian science...Oh god
<oni_link> i still need to play scribblenauts
<OverGrownPegasus10> Scribblenauts sounds fun
<Vordox> Lawl Phase XD
<oni_link> this also reminds me a bit of Kirby's Canvas Curse
<Meanwhile> Scribblenauts, also very boring very fast.
<Vordox> Cheating Pusher Phase4 XD
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Vordox> oni_link: Kirby Canvas. <3
<OverGrownPegasus10> Brb guys
<OverGrownPegasus10> I need to find what this reminds me of
<alexxm> yeah i mean when you have pretty much every word in the english langauge you can't really think of what to do with it Meanwhile
<oni_link> Vordox: again, another game i need to play , i tried it out , loved it and never played it again . i need that game now
<|Discord|> Oh yeah this game
<Vordox> oni_link: The one where you draw with your text that creates an item of that name?
<Meanwhile> alexxm: That and being able to do that gets dull very quick.
<Vordox> Remember, Phase4 ...Mass.
<oni_link> Vordox: yeah but nah, I want the Kirby game more now that i remebered it :D
<oni_link> Kirby<3
<Vordox> oni_link: Hehe. :P Played that and 100%, fun game
<JRP2234[Web]> o shit
<Vordox> Super easy first island, after that, once the rockets get into play.. :P
<JRP2234[Web]> my bed started shaling
<JRP2234[Web]> shaking*
<Vordox> LOL
<MadSurge> :O what game is this?
<Vordox> Science in your FACE Phase4 XD
<oni_link> Vordox: rockets? this game needs my money
<Meanwhile> Derp
<Vordox> oni_link: Just wait
<Meanwhile> Dat push
<Phase4> 00,02xD
<Vordox> Phase4: Smart, you can "hook" stuff to keep them placed in place. Think of like how you put a storage cart after your car, the "hook" like that
<oni_link> Phase4: why you no create ramp, then object to move circle to ramp??
<Meanwhile> Pffft.
<Vordox> Haha Phase4 XD
<OverGrownPegasus10> http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-magic-pen-2/index.html
<OverGrownPegasus10> This is what this game reminds me of
<OverGrownPegasus10> SO MUCH
<Vordox> Phase4: Make things rounded, a circle with an end. Like 0 to make it into a mass
<OverGrownPegasus10> Magic Pen is exactly like this
<MadSurge> YAY
<Vordox> Or 8, or 6, etc etc, just make sure they are closed to give them mass, and that mass helps against gravity alot
<Vordox> Leverage TIME!
<OverGrownPegasus10> Okay now I'm satisfied that I know what it reminds me of
<Vordox> Phase4: Draw a BIG object in the air with a mass onto the leverage
<OverGrownPegasus10> But this one seems better
<MadSurge> Such a simple game :)
<alexxm> not enoughleverage
<Vordox> MadSurge: Life is simpler then you think :P
<OverGrownPegasus10> What is this game called anyway?
<Vordox> OverGrownPegasus10: Crayon Physics Deluxe
<Mistress_Molestia> Hello my sujects
<OverGrownPegasus10> FFFFF-
<MadSurge> Vordox: I already think life is simple :)
<alexxm> hey Mistress_Molestia hows your day been
<Vordox> Phase4: Make it "Closed" Space, like an 0 or 6, to give them HUGE mass.
<DarkStar> Hi Mistress_Molestia
<FalonSquirreltamer> hi mistress :)
<Vordox> Phase4: Lines = Small Mass, Circles, or closed = Huge mass
<Vordox> LOL
<Phase4> 00,02k
<Vordox> Interesting WAY of solving it Phase4 XD
<Mistress_Molestia> Its early alexxm not much has happened
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, worked didnt it
<OverGrownPegasus10> Now heres the question, which came out first? Magic Pen or Color Physics?
<Vordox> Phase4: True, there IS no true solution, you can solve it HWOEVER you want
<oni_link> Mistress_Molestia: your highness
<DarkStar> Excuse me Mistress, do you know where your sister Luna is?
<OverGrownPegasus10> I MUST PLAY THIS
<Mistress_Molestia> DarkStar, Im not sure.
<OverGrownPegasus10> NOW
<alexxm> hammer
<Vordox> NOW THE FUN BEGINS!
<MadSurge> Is Mistress_Molestia really a mistress? :D
<OverGrownPegasus10> HAZZAH! THE FUN HAS BEEN TRIPLED!
<Meanwhile> I'd rather leave that question unanswered MadSurge.
<alexxm> looks more like an axe to me
<oni_link> Science the vidya game!!
<Mistress_Molestia> Yes I am
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: :D Hiiii
<OverGrownPegasus10> oni_link, Portal is science the video game. Ask science woona.
<DarkStar> Tax[M] what does the M mean?
<OverGrownPegasus10> This is, *makes rainbow with hands* IMAGGGGINATIOOON
<Tax[M]> DarkStar: It means I'm property of Mistress_Molestia.
<rocketbrony> hello peoples :D
<DarkStar> Wha?
<Meanwhile> Well that answers that then. >_>
<oni_link> OverGrownPegasus10: i completely forgot :O i love portal, GlAdoS would have my head if she heard that
<OverGrownPegasus10> It means he's infectied with monkies
<alexxm> hey rocketbrony hows your day been
<FalonSquirreltamer> hello rocketbrony
<DarkStar> May I ask how you got that?
<alexxm> Tac[M] what
<rocketbrony> i just woke up XD
<Vordox> Phase4: Push is for casuals. ;)
<Vordox> Bridge time!
<OverGrownPegasus10> Pffffft.
<OverGrownPegasus10> Silly filly, that wasn't a bridge
<rocketbrony> i'v seen this game somewhere...what was it
<OverGrownPegasus10> That was a GIANT HAMMMMMER
<Vordox> The blue dots makes ANYTHING that's connected to them swingable OR MAKE them stale, like 2 dots = Unmovable objects.
<alexxm> well that was a success
<oni_link> I would have made a slope
<OverGrownPegasus10> rocketbrony Magic Pen?
<Vordox> THere we go!
<Vordox> SCIEEENCE
<OverGrownPegasus10> It's exactly like this
<rocketbrony> oh yeah! thats it!
<Irish_Pony> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d52cs3s one brave bastard
<rocketbrony> its been 2 years since i played that..
<|Discord|> Science is best idea
<oni_link> dat butter knife
<OverGrownPegasus10> QUICK, DRAW A BUTTERFLY
<MadSurge> Science Woona approves :D
<Vordox> Phase4 takes the easy way. XD
<Phase4> 00,02i think i broke it
<OverGrownPegasus10> Lol
<rocketbrony> LOL its stuck in there
<MadSurge> Vordox: why not
<oni_link> Yep, its broken :D
<rocketbrony> nvm XD
<OverGrownPegasus10> Wow.
<OverGrownPegasus10> O.O
<oni_link> He broke the science
<rocketbrony> whoever is playing this. they are failing.
<alexxm> so how did that happen
<OverGrownPegasus10> Phase is
<Meanwhile> The answer is to draw stuff.
<Irish_Pony> xD
<OverGrownPegasus10> LOL
<FalonSquirreltamer> xD
<OverGrownPegasus10> What is that? A fortune cookie?
<rocketbrony> i think he's just winging it here....lol

<Vordox> Use mass to solve this Phase4 .^^
<Crono_brony> DAMN YOU MIPS.TV!
<OverGrownPegasus10> It's a wrenchQ
<Crono_brony> it never works for me.
<MadSurge> Crono_brony: if you don't see it try refreshing the stream <:3

<Dark92Enigma> Hello everypony!
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back
<Phase4> 00,02ohai Dark92Enigma and OverGrownPegasus10
<alexxm> hey Dark92Enigma hows your day been
<oni_link> Phase4: I dont blame you, it happens to me but with the TV remote :D
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, i solved that
<Phase4> 00,02simply dont watch tv :P
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm i couldn't be more excited, because The Hunchback of Notre Dame will premiere right here on bronystate!!!!!!!!!
<Irish_Pony> i love that movie :)
<oni_link> Phase4: well with a lack of the Hub network now and the only channels I watch being Adult Swim and Comedy Central, I don't watch much anymore anyhow.
<Barbetos|AtWork> surf map?
<CCCP> lol
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, the only show i care to watch is star trek
<Phase4> 00,02which is thursday and saturday i think
<Phase4> 00,02three eps of next gen on thur, 3 of voyager on sat
<CCCP> Phase4: so you don't watch ponies?
<Phase4> 00,02they dont show ponies here
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<Phase4> 00,02well they do, on foxtel
<Phase4> 00,02but foxtel is crap
<oni_link> Phase4: nice. It's not my thing but I respect Star Trek for lasting as long as it has.
<Irish_Pony> oi Phase4 accept the friend request so i can give you your gift :)
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, its a very unique series
<MadSurge> I remember a time playing TF2 where we made a stalemate. It ended up in a dancing contest between engineers :D
<FlareChaser|Sleep> lol I just slept :3
<Phase4> 00,02theres no other real speculative sci-fi show
<CCCP> do you think Friendship is Magic will still have fans long after it ends?
<oni_link> Phase4: I shall give it a go. Which series should I start with?
<Meanwhile> I like Voyager,.
<XAX> CCCP: most likely
<oni_link> CCCP: I would hope so.
<Barbetos|AtWork> CCCP probably depends on g5, but I think g4 will be around for a long time.
<Crono_brony> CCCP: don't make me think about... THE END.
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, either next gen or voyager tbh, the original series is very much a product of its time
<MadSurge> CCCP: I think so :3 friendship never ends!
<CCCP> :3
*Phase4 00,02hasnt seen that much of the original series
<oni_link> As long as the community keeps loving it, then we will see it being loved for years
<diddutz> why do pyros troll so much -.-
<oni_link> And oc
<MadSurge> Phase4: so, Picard fan? :)
<oni_link> Phase4: Will do, thanks
*XAX is about to do a reading of chapter 1 of Silent Ponyville 2
<Phase4> 00,02MadSurge, i'd say so
<XAX> ive already done a reading for the whole of the first one :p
<Irish_Pony> Phase4: sent you your gift :)
<MadSurge> These custom maps are so trippy
<oni_link> XAX: oh yeah, kudos for that. I remember you sent me the links for the first oen
<oni_link> *one
<XAX> Oh, thats right :o
<OtakuTom> TOS was okay, but I definitely prefer Next Gen
<XAX> Phase4: omg surf

<Meanwhile> I used to wonder what pocket lint could be.
<Irish_Pony> Spectrum_Rush: :D

<FillyFlam> alexxm: True, but they're still far better than a lot of other things out there.

<Pinkies4thWall|Xbox> *link
<MadSurge> Scoot-Scootaloo: you sound confused :D
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Not even a little, but I can probably come up with a good enough word to describe it.
<alexxm> whats loink
*Pinkies4thWall|Xbox brushies Scoot-Scootaloo's mane
<Pinkies4thWall|Xbox> fun fact. Bronystate has improved my typing speed
<Dark_Horst> hey, this dude, jogi löw? he needs a pony. you guys wouldnt how that could be achieved?
<sergio_scriptor> what is the problem Vordox ? math or algebra homework ? :)
<Vordox> Okay, shortly, There's 2 animations that I want to go together, one is a total of 20 Frames, The other one is at 20 Frames, and the 22 frames should be withn the FPS of 8, while the 20 Frame should be 24, how to mix these two together so that the 22 frames DOES NOT BECOME distorted. What's the math for this?
<Vordox> Ah sorry, 22 frames and 20 frames
<sergio_scriptor> hummmm....
*Gunthler|Away is back (gone 00:15:29)
<alexxm> hey Gunthler|Away

<Vordox> XD
<Vordox> Okay, resaying it
<Lil_B> Vordox wait.. so all the 20 in your questian are 22?
<EspyLacopa> Pinkies4thWall|Xbox: My big aid to learning to type quickly, was when I had to type to chat during Counter-strike matches back in college.
<sergio_scriptor> Vordox: i have no idea sorry,but if you have problems on scientific equations just call me
<FalonSquirreltamer> hey fillys and gentlecolts im back :3
<Vordox> One frame animation with 22 Frames, the core one that is. The other is 20 Frames. the 20 Frames should be at 24 FPS, while the Core animation should be in 8 FPS, how to mix these together without f'cking up
<Vordox> the core animation
*Bronysith glomps thatguy
<sergio_scriptor> hi FalonSquirreltamer
<Ouroboros> Hello.
<Vordox> How many frames do I need for the core animation from switching the FPS from 8 to 24?
<sergio_scriptor> hi Ouroboros
<Vordox> This one is PROBABLY super easy...if I knew what the buck i was doing...
<sergio_scriptor> ordox: is that homework or something for work ?
<Pinkies4thWall|Xbox> Ouroboros: Is Blazblue the namesake of your nick?
<Vordox> sergio_scriptor: No, it's Animation
<Vordox> Pinkies4thWall|Xbox: BLAZBLUE! <3
<Lil_B> Vordox sounds like something a good animater would figure out with some rule-of-thump in 10 seconds flat, but yeah
<Ouroboros> Afraid not Pinkies4thWall
<sergio_scriptor> Vordox: hobby then ?
<Vordox> Lil_B: 10 sec flat...okay, gonna test that

<otakon17> Sorry guys, forgot to say bye
<Nabronyan> My hands hurt so bad
<Meanwhile> Bye otakon17.
<Lil_B> Vordox I guess I could try to calculate something, but i have no knowledge about animations, so i would need at least 5 minutes of concentraited calculating to a) figure the formulars out and b) actually trying to get a solution XD
<Vordox> Oh nevermind, It's 4x22 fps + offshift of 24. :D
<Vordox> Solved it, nevermind
<otakon17> Also, firefox decided to pull an error on me again
<MadSurge> Nabronyan: how so? :O
<Lil_B> Vordox thats what i ment XD
