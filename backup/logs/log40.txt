<prince-dari> Gen 1 is where it's at anyway. :P
<drf-Droid> so I'm not sure what you're talking about
<Mikey> some of the pokemon on gen 5 are stupid though
<eXAKR> Unfortunately no Rage TM in Black and White
<Mikey> like the goth girl ones
<Lambda> XD yeah
<eXAKR> And then
<Mikey> and the red/blue samurai people
<eXAKR> CHRISTINE JUMPS OUT AND EATS YOU
<Lambda> but the ones that are cool are really cool
*eXAKR hides
<Mikey> but for the most part they're all pretty decent
<Aurora> 6rage tm in what games?
<eXAKR> Gen 1
<eXAKR> >>
<Aurora> 6...
<Aurora> 6OH SURE THAT WORKS
<ChaoHerba> 3OMG CHRISTINE!!!!!!!
<Quanyails> 7Rage continued to work until the end of battle then.
<eXAKR> I was like
*ChaoHerba 3hides under a rock
<eXAKR> Nice
<eXAKR> I still prefer tentacle monsters that turn into cars
<prince-dari> I don't really like any other than gen 1.
<prince-dari> Because they're all awesome.
<Quanyails> 7That again.
<Aurora> 6lol
<eXAKR> You know... tentacles.
<ChaoHerba> 3lol?
*eXAKR RUNS
<prince-dari> You can only make so many before it becomes pretty old.
<Mikey> my favorite generator is 2
<Mikey> then 1 comes second
*eXAKR stuffs a Tentacruel into a random car
<eXAKR> There
<Lambda> my favorite is 1
<eXAKR> Tentacles and cars
<Lambda> then 2, then 5
<ChaoHerba> 3poor car
<ChaoHerba> 3it will be tentackled
*ChaoHerba 3flees
<prince-dari> I don't play pokemon anymore anyway, I got kind of bored with playing what's essentially the same game again and again. :/
<Chimera> 04Gen 1 had many differences to Gen 2 o.o;
<Chimera> 04iirc
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/xu5xg.jpg <- this just happened
<eXAKR> I have seen a lot of silly horror movie ideas
*ChaoHerba 3now has 2 female Pururiru's
<drf-Droid> yeah
<eXAKR> Go look up on Death Bed: The Bed that Eats
<drf-Droid> remember when Night Shade was ghost?
<Lambda> I had to think of how to say happy birthday to my /b/tard friend
<drf-Droid> that was awesome
<Aurora> 6pururiru?
<Quanyails> 7Lol.
<Chimera> 04it still is...
<drf-Droid> no
<Chimera> 04I think
<Quanyails> 7I got them as trade fodder from my friend.
<drf-Droid> it's Darj
<ChaoHerba> 3might shade is ghost........
<Chimera> 04oh wow
<eXAKR> I was like ಠ_ಠ
<drf-Droid> *Dark
<prince-dari> Lawl, I wrote my sister's birthday card in lolspeak.
<Quanyails> 7So now I'm using it as trade fodder. XD
<ChaoHerba> 3omg dark
<Quanyails> 7them*
<eXAKR> Night Shade is ghost type
<drf-Droid> Dark is like the most pointless type ever
<drf-Droid> and no
<Chimera> 04wasn't Night Shade one of the only Ghost types?
<drf-Droid> Night Shade is dark type afaik
<Quanyails> 7Lulz, DRF.
<Quanyails> 7Night Shade is Ghost.
<Chimera> 04Night Shade (Japanese: ナイトヘッド Night Head) is a damage-dealing Ghost-type move introduced in Generation I. Prior to Generation II, it was the signature move of the Gastly evolution line.
<Chimera> 04:|
*Chimera derps DRF
<Quanyails> 7Dark was meant to counter the overpowered Psychic type in the 2nd generation.
<drf-Droid> OK wtf
<Chimera> 04After Generation I, the type mechanics were altered so that Night Shade and all other Ghost-type moves hit Psychic-type Pokémon, leaving only Normal-type Pokémon immune to Night Shade. Night Shade will still inflict damage equal to the user's level.
<Light_Latias> 12XD
<drf-Droid> ah
<drf-Droid> that's why
<Lambda> I just linked him to nyan.cat
<Chimera> 04and yes Psychic was VERY powerful
<eXAKR> There is Astonish, Hex, Lick, Omnious Wind, Shadow Ball/Claw/Force/Punch/Sneak
<Lambda> his reply: *puts gun to head*
<drf-Droid> so it behaves identical to Dark
<drf-Droid> and um
<Aurora> 6dude
<eXAKR> Oh God Psychic
<Quanyails> 7No? O.o
<Aurora> 6back in 2nd gen
<eXAKR> I HATE that move
<drf-Droid> Ghost was powerful against psychic
<Quanyails> 7It behaves like a ghost attack.
<eXAKR> Except when I use it
<Aurora> 6espeon + shadow ball/bite = powerhouse
<drf-Droid> so why do you need dark
<eXAKR> Then it's :D
<Quanyails> 7It hits everything except normal.
<Aurora> 6er
<Aurora> 6no
<SilverSonic> Dammit I cant get past taht celing shadow creature thing x.x
<Aurora> 6not shadow ball
<eXAKR> Roara
<Light_Latias> 12didn't Curse switch to Ghost?
<Aurora> 6it was bite
<Quanyails> 7Yep, LL.
<Light_Latias> 12originally it was ???
<Chimera> 04yes LL
<eXAKR> You are giving me ideas
<drf-Droid> no
<drf-Droid> LL
<Chimera> 04??? was pointless apparently :P
<eXAKR> For my Espeon on BW
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Chimera> 04,,,
<Quanyails> 7Indeed.
<Aurora> 6cuz ghost was physical back then
<eXAKR> That is named Xelig00n
*eXAKR hides
<Quanyails> 7Magic Bounce Dual Screener. :)
<Aurora> 6NOW you teach espeon shadow ball
<Aurora> 6LOL
<Chimera> 04XD
<Quanyails> 7I came up with that first, eXAKR.
<Light_Latias> 12wat Danny
<drf-Droid> Curse is ??? if your Pokémon is any type other than ghost
<eXAKR> You DO?
<Quanyails> 7(Except half-masked.)
<Chimera> 04no
<Chimera> 04drf stop feeding people misinformation
<drf-Droid> and still is
<Light_Latias> 12everyone else said yes
<Chimera> 04Curse is changed to Ghost as of Gen 5
<Quanyails> 7Indeed, at Chim and LL.
<Lambda> "I hate it when I buy a bag of air and there are some chips in it."
<Chimera> 04-_-
<Lambda> XDDD
<eXAKR> I have it named Xelig00n full
<Quanyails> 7I named it Ilex.
<drf-Droid> well gen 5 doesn't exist
<drf-Droid> so
<Quanyails> 7Because it sounds better than Xelig00n. XD
<eXAKR> Curse was ??? before gen 4
<Light_Latias> 12Danny, even on a Ghost at first it was ???
<Chimera> 04Stop acting like that >>
<ChaoHerba> 3um drf....Night Shade still Ghost
<ChaoHerba> 3OMG OSHAWOTT!!!!!1
<drf-Droid> yeah, it's ??? unless you're ghost type
<eXAKR> I just named it Xelig00n
<ChaoBlack> omg so silent
<Chimera> 04no it ISN'T
<eXAKR> makes for more fun
<Quanyails> 7Chao, lagging you are.
<Chimera> 04It was ALWAYS ???
<Chimera> 04Until Gen 5
<drf-Droid> no
<eXAKR> Xelig00n wants to learn Confusion! etc etc
<Quanyails> 7You're a bit bull-headed, aren't you?
<Chimera> 04the thing was Ghost types had a difference in its affect
<drf-Droid> in gen 4 it was ghost on a ghost type
<Chimera> 04wow
<Aurora> 6it was ??? up until gen 5 yeh
<Chimera> 04no it WAS NOT
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<Chimera> 04wait
<ChaoAqua> um, is it just me or is nick changing not working
<Light_Latias> 12thats why I said ORIGINALLY
<Chimera> 04no I swear it wasn't o-o
*eXAKR sends drf-Droid to the Moon by using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device
<drf-Droid> I know LL
<Quanyails> 7ChaoAqua, you're lagging, I bet.
<Light_Latias> 12...
<ChaoAqua> or, is my computer lagging again
<Aurora> 6portals
<Aurora> 6that's right, I should play that
<Quanyails> 7...
<drf-Droid> we should have a rule
<Quanyails> 7eXAKR
<eXAKR> lolPortal
<Chimera> 04Curse (Japanese: のろい Noroi) is a non-damaging Ghost-type move introduced in Generation II. Before Generation V, it was a ???-type move, and the only move of that type.
<Quanyails> 7You fish, don't say that.
<drf-Droid> if you have someone on ignore, do not talk to them
<eXAKR> ...ok
<Quanyails> 7Rora needs to get through the game!
<drf-Droid> I'm completely serious
*eXAKR turns into an eagle and tucks into a fish
<Quanyails> 7Hmm...
<Helanga> 12o-o
*Quanyails 7somehow devilishly smiles.
<eXAKR> Eagle flags.
<drf-Droid> and FINALLY someone other than me is enforcing "no spoilers" >_>
*Light_Latias 12eeps
<Lambda> hey Mikey, when you ask for just the toy will they let you ask for a specific one?
<Quanyails> 7Ahem, DRF: considering our current predicament, might I suggest you stay out of our discussion?
<Light_Latias> 12ITS A COOKBOOK
*Light_Latias 12hides
<Mikey> yeah sure
<drf-Droid> Chimera, bulbapedia is editable by anyone
<Chimera> 04and?
*Quanyails 7thinks of TLS @ LL's statement.
<Mikey> if they have it there at least
<drf-Droid> I could go change it to say it's ghost type
<eXAKR> Everyone
<Quanyails> 7Everywhere else states it as well, dRF.
<Quanyails> 7DRF*
<drf-Droid> so don't use it to back up arguments.
<Chimera> 04And then it'll be changed back
<Mikey> they won't have all of them at first and you wanna go every couple days so they don't run out of the one you're missing
<Chimera> 04-_-
<drf-Droid> not always
<Chimera> 04most of the time
<Light_Latias> 12XD Quan'
<Quanyails> 7Don't defy facts, DRF.
<Aurora> 6http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Curse_%28move%29
<Light_Latias> 12that was originally Twilight Zone
<Aurora> 6k now can we move on?
<ChaoAqua> 4OMG SO MUCH LAGGGGGG!!!!!!!
<ChaoAqua> 4brb
<drf-Droid> depends on how good you are at hiding misinformation in articles
<Quanyails> 7Mmm'kay.
<Chimera> 04Aurora
<Chimera> 04nope
*Quanyails 7facepaws.
<Mikey> hahaa
<eXAKR> You know guys
<Lambda> they better have Snivy tomorrow
<Lambda> :P
<Quanyails> 7Why don't you just admit you're wrong, DRF?
<Chimera> 04because drf does not think Bulbapedia is right
<eXAKR> Just put drf on ignore
<Chimera> 04k
<Chimera> 04:P
<Quanyails> 7Why not just shun him? o3o

<prince-dari> Oh, lol.
<ChaoMagma> 4Me will put a Rapidash with a Master Ball up for trade :)
*Quanyails 7should record her playing N's Farewell sometime.
*eXAKR just gets into a car with a Tentacruel in it
<drf-Droid> LOL, did you hack a masterball?
<ChaoMagma> 4*cough* no *cough*
<drf-Droid> LOL
<ChaoMagma> 4i just, uh, used cheats to have a master ball
<ChaoMagma> 4:)
<drf-Droid> that = hacking
<prince-dari> My epic hacked magikarp still got 1HKOed.
<drf-Droid> I didn't say I don't approve
<drf-Droid> I was just asking
*ChaoMagma 4flies to the nearest volcano
<prince-dari> WHY U NO BE EPIC?
<eXAKR> Because it's a Magikarp
<Quanyails> 7Chao, if you haven't heard, I found a shiny Excadrill today. o3o
<eXAKR> I put Exp. Share on mine's
<ChaoMagma> 4oooooooooh
<eXAKR> The moment it became Gyarados, I taught it epic moves using reusable TMs
<drf-Droid> People shouldn't battle others with hacked Pokémon
<ChaoMagma> 4will yuu make it as fast as your current Doryuzu?
<drf-Droid> I mean, I don't mind hacking them for fun
<Quanyails> 7From suggestions on what to name it, I named it Toph. :P
<Quanyails> 7And actually, it's faster.
<drf-Droid> but as soon as you battle, don't use it
<Quanyails> 7It has a Naive nature.
<ChaoMagma> 4lol
<ChaoMagma> 4Toph
<prince-dari> So there are bronies in Valve.
<Quanyails> 7Which raises speed.
<ChaoMagma> 4is it blind?

<Mikey> I'm still waiting on snives
<ChaoMagma> 4i think i haven't battled anyone from TST yet
<Quanyails> 7She's a girl. She controls the earth and metal. She's small yet powerful. She's derived from a mole. :P

<drf-Droid> OMG derived
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<drf-Droid> so what's its integral
<Aurora> 6mole lol
<Mikey> there's plenty fans of both genders so I'm surprised it's not a generic toy
<ChaoMagma> 4only my friend and a random dude
<ChaoMagma> 4also RM
<Lambda> it should be a toy for both boys and girls
<ChaoMagma> 4OMGOMGOMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<prince-dari> Apparently Valve is suffering the same fate as Riot Games. Various employees are sporting pony avatars, and their Official Tech Support steam group has adopted a Gorden Freemane avatar. For every negative press release we get, two major entertainment hubs convert to ponydom. I love the internet.

<Chimera> 04XD
*Light_Latias 12eye-raises
<drf-Droid> LL

<Light_Latias> 12I've been your telephone before
<eXAKR> drf is being Gilda from MLP:FiM
<Chimera> 04rofl
<drf-Droid> that's it
<Chimera> 04nice comparison eXAKR
<drf-Droid> I am adding a new rule when I get home
<SilverSonic> :o
<Chimera> 04aaand bye
<Chimera> 04I think
<Light_Latias> 12and it says?
<eXAKR> k
<Light_Latias> 12*states
<Light_Latias> 12w/e
<Chimera> 04"whoever talks to someone if they're ignoring them will be banned"
<Chimera> 04:|
<Chimera> 04I can guarentee
<drf-Droid> if you have someone on ignore, act like they don't exist and don't talk about them in the open
<Light_Latias> 12more like annoys
<SilverSonic> which is a retarded rule
<Light_Latias> 12that works
<Light_Latias> 12but
<Chimera> 04SS yes :|
<Light_Latias> 12isn't it ultimately up to higher authority?
<Barry> It is possible, though if he does, he won't have all day like he usually does when he's home
<prince-dari> If someone has ignored you, why not ignore them back?
<Light_Latias> 12to allow that
<Chimera> 04"DRF? Who's that?"
<drf-Droid> because eXAKR refuses to stop talking to me
<drf-Droid> er
<drf-Droid> talking about me
<Chimera> 04nice fix
<drf-Droid> LL, higher authority isn't here right now.
<Chimera> 04And you realize that's your pet peeve
<Barry> If I'm using the wrong gender, please let me know. I'm going off of the prince part of Dari's name
<Light_Latias> 12so you're Admin now?
<SilverSonic> drf, you arent the leader of this channel
<SilverSonic> :P
<drf-Droid> I'm a mod
<Chimera> 04Why don't YOU follow your OWN idea, drf?
<ChaoMagma> 4........................
<drf-Droid> mods can edit rules
<SilverSonic> exactly
<Chimera> 04[21:28:10] <prince-dari> If someone has ignored you, why not ignore them back?
<drf-Droid> Chimera
<Chimera> 04erm

<drf-Droid> so thefefore
<Chimera> 04okay then

<drf-Droid> I am following my own rule
<Chimera> 04SUCK IT UP

<SilverSonic> then learn to ignore manualy
<SilverSonic> :P

<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello EccoCode

<drf-Droid> Silversonic
<EccoCode> Hi Chimera and everyone.
<Umbreon> 12it's not fair for one mod alone to make rules as he/she pleases
<Chimera> 04hi Ecco
<drf-Droid> you're telling me to ignore the entire channel
<Chimera> 04Leave now
<Aurora> 6my god I can only see half this conversation and this is crap

<Chimera> 04Roara it was
<eXAKR> Everyone
<Umbreon> 12i'm on the fence about it
<Chimera> 04you have bad timing
<Chimera> 04:/
<eXAKR> just shun the non-believer
<ChaoMagma> 4no
<ChaoMagma> 4someone had emonga
<Umbreon> 12for starters drf

<Light_Latias> 12butt out
<ChaoMagma> 4wnated waruvial
<ChaoMagma> 4i traded
<Umbreon> 12your reason for making the rule is based off something really personal
<EccoCode> Oh dear, I said Chimera when it was ChaoMagma who greeted me when I came in, *somehow got the two confused*
<drf-Droid> eXAKR is STILL TALKING ABOUT ME
<ChaoMagma> 4emonga isn't in krookodile's place!!!!!!!!!!!!
<eXAKR> what'
<Umbreon> 12just like when i wanted to ban kipikipo really badly
*Chimera noms Ecco
<Quanyails> 7Check the first few boxes in the PC, Chao.
<Umbreon> 12but got told off by everyone for it being such a personal situation
<drf-Droid> Umbreon, nobody would have blamed you
*ChaoMagma 4was confused......................
<Quanyails> 7It doesn't 'replace' the pokemon's location in the box.
<drf-Droid> wel
<drf-Droid> Jwell
<drf-Droid> **
<drf-Droid> Kipi left anyway
<drf-Droid> so
<Umbreon> 12you have no idea how badly i wanted to ban him
<drf-Droid> you should be happy
<Umbreon> 12yet i resisted and just sucked itu p
<drf-Droid> yes I do
<drf-Droid> you told me

<Umbreon> 12same goes to eXAKR
*Quanyails 7sneaks in another bag of popcorn.
<drf-Droid> the concept of talking about someone because you know they can't reply is incredibly rude
*Chimera eats out of Quanyails' bag of popcorn
<drf-Droid> IMHO
<Chimera> 04:3
<Quanyails> 7o3o
*Quanyails 7somehow gets a popcorn machine.
<Umbreon> 12drf is this the first time you heard of gossiping?
<Chimera> 04he's informing other people to ignore someone if they're pissing them off
<SilverSonic> drf: what you say doesnt equal fact
<Light_Latias> 12it should be for ALL mods to decide Danny
<SilverSonic> its opinion
<Chimera> 04which is understandable
<ChaoMagma> 4alright
<Light_Latias> 12while I agree with you
<SilverSonic> which you carry out way too far
<ChaoMagma> 4i know i'm not crazy
<Light_Latias> 12still
<drf-Droid> gossip is usually done IN PRIVATE
<Aurora> 6it's been said before, both sides are out of line here
<Chimera> 04also lul Quan
<Chimera> 04k um
<prince-dari> drf-Droid: I do see you're point, however you shouldn't let it get to you.

<drf-Droid> that would be like if I went
<ChaoMagma> 4Yes, Quany?

<eXAKR> Noooooooooooooooo!

<drf|laptop> 03I hope "a forum" isn't TST forum
<prince-dari> For one, it wouldn't make any difference it was, note I said a "pony spam topic", IE a topic for spamming ponies, in the spam section of a forum.
<prince-dari> I don't use the TST forum anyway.
<prince-dari> if it was*
<drf|laptop> 03yes but making spam topics eats up valuable disk space in the database so I would be forced to sotp you :P>
<drf|laptop> 03*stop
<prince-dari> I don't know if TST has a spam forum, but the entire point is useless posts, so I don't see why.
<Roara> Wet have plenty lol
<Damos> use the force drf
<Damos> no not the force
<Roara> Just look in forum games

<drf|laptop> 03<prince-dari> I don't know if TST has a spam forum, but the entire point is useless posts, so I don't see why. <- it doesn't have a "spam section"
<drf|laptop> 03forum games... are basically spam yeah but at least there's a point to thpem
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03there's supposedly a point
<drf|laptop> 03I don't see one but yeah
<Lambda> and of course

<drf|laptop> 03<Damos> <drf|laptop> hacking government sites < how do you hack gov. sites <- very carefully
<prince-dari> They put my PSN details online and I still think they're funny.
<drf|laptop> 03I'm not saying *I* know how to but people have done it
<prince-dari> Lulzsec hacked some CIA thing.
<Damos> you've done it
<Damos> I can feel the timing
<Damos> between each sentence from that
<drf|laptop> 03no
<Damos> I could feel it
<drf|laptop> 03and yeah, Lulzsec is awesome
<Damos> DENIAL!
<drf|laptop> 03because Sony deserves to die in a fire
<prince-dari> ^
<SilverSonic> No, They dont

<SilverSonic> Lulzsec deserves to die in hell.
<drf|laptop> 03and then talk to me
<Damos> no they don't
*SilverSonic runs
<SilverSonic> they do'
<prince-dari> Lulzsec is lulzy.
<drf|laptop> 03Sony made music CDs that maliciously installed viruses on their users' computers
<drf|laptop> 03can you seriously tell me a company who does that doesn't deserve to die
<drf|laptop> 03not to mention, they don't even back up their own products
<Damos> Lufthansa
<Damos> ?
<drf|laptop> 03I had a Sony DVD player that broke, it was covered by the 1 year warranty, but I called them and they were like "You have to pay to get it replaced"
<drf|laptop> 03so I was like fine, I'll go buy a different brand
<drf|laptop> 03the only reason I bought a PS3 is because Sony loses about $50 for every PS3 sold :D
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Damos> well what about ea games?
<drf|laptop> 03or so they say
<drf|laptop> 03I don't know if that's true or not but supposedly they od
<drf|laptop> 03*do
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03Some people think EA is evil and so on
<drf|laptop> 03I personally am indifferent
<drf|laptop> 03there aren't any EA games I like therefore I don't play any therefore I wouldn't know
<prince-dari> I've not heard anything about EA, why are they evil? O_o
<Damos> well at least Microsft games are good
<drf|laptop> 03but if EA starts rootkitting people, I'm going to boycott them too.
<SilverSonic> Just EWWWWWWWWWWWWW MADDEN GAMES
<drf|laptop> 03prince-dari, something about DRM in their software
<prince-dari> Oh.
<drf|laptop> 03obviously only referring to PC versions
<drf|laptop> 03I pretty much refuse to buy anything with DRM
<drf|laptop> 03on concept
<SilverSonic> i cant believe im saying this, but british football is better than american
*SilverSonic RUNS LIKE HELL
<drf|laptop> 03the exception is videos on iTunes, and that's only because I have a decrypter
<drf|laptop> 03SilverSonic I agree
<drf|laptop> 03though I hate sports in general
<drf|laptop> 03both soccer and football are incredibly overrated :P
<SilverSonic> lol my grandpa yelled at me when i told him that
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah, I hate American football too, it's like, you can't play football and still have working brain cells by the end of your career
<drf|laptop> 03yeah some guys are too into it
<drf|laptop> 03like those idiots who shout at their TV
<prince-dari> I don't like either over the other, I just don't get why American football is called "football" in America, when there's hardly any kicking of the ball.
<Damos> well arn't microsoft better than ea?
<drf|laptop> 03um, Damos
<drf|laptop> 03Microsoft doesn't make games

<Stormy> Yeah
<prince-dari> That link is brony do a presentation on MLP.
<prince-dari> To his class.

<NightSeas> 12Also, do you know how to stea- I mean download youtube videos as MP3 files?
<NightSeas> 12drf?
<drf|laptop> 03yes
<eXAKR> Keepvid.com
<drf|laptop> 03just don't use one those stupid converter sites
<drf|laptop> 03like keepvid
<eXAKR> There's an option to download as mp3
<drf|laptop> 03it horribly degrades quality
<eXAKR> But the quality is bad
<drf|laptop> 03get DownloadHelper
<drf|laptop> 03download the mp4
<eXAKR> Alternatively
<drf|laptop> 03then convert that XD
<eXAKR> download the video
<NightSeas> 12Ah
<drf|laptop> 03and if you don't care if it's mp3 or not
<drf|laptop> 03you can just extract the mp4 audio
<eXAKR> Use a program called Freemake Video converter to extract the audio to mp3
<drf|laptop> 03which is the format that iTunes uses anyway

<Espeon> 06I get what you mean in a way x3
<TurniBrony> Spoiler alert: It's pretty good.
<Barry> ... wat?
<Barry> That's no spoiler
<Chimera> 04I just found the biggest plothole in Invader Zim
<TurniBrony> ;p
<Barry> anyway, I'm not too into Horror films.
<TurniBrony> Well, then you're in luck. It's not a horror film.
<Chimera> 04When he has the hypnotic pimple "Pastulio," he could have brodcasted it on TV.
<Barry> But I guess it depends on how graphic the violence is.
<Chimera> 04Then hypnotized the planet.
<Chimera> 04But he didn't XD
<TurniBrony> I've seen worse.
<Barry> Have you watch the movie "The Final Destination"?
<Barry> I tried myself, but could barely get through the prologue.
<Barry> before I had to turn it off
<TurniBrony> The Final Destination?
<TurniBrony> Isn't that one of those throwaway PG-13 flicks?
<TurniBrony> Horror should go big or go home. :P
<eXAKR> Well

<Bygios> Angel_Espeon, you are a 4Shellos.
<Angel_Espeon> 13.w.
<Barry> It definitely looked big from what I saw
<TurniBrony> Oh. Was it in 3D too? :P
<Barry> yep
<Barry> though I didn't get to watch it that way. It was in 3D in theaters
<Barry> The very last Harry Potter film will be in 3D, too
<TurniBrony> It's like we're really in the 60's or something again.
<TurniBrony> Thanks James. :P
<Barry> lol
<Barry> Did you get that from "Nice one, James" from the Order of the Phoenix film?
<TurniBrony> Nope.avi
<TurniBrony> Never seen it.
<Barry> oh, well
<TurniBrony> That wily James Cameron. Allways pioneering something. Can't all be great all the time though. :P
<FiveYearOldDamos> a 95% chance im going to germany
<Barry> James Cameron? Who's he?
<lightlugia> O.o
<lightlugia> :3
<TurniBrony> Oh, just a director. You might have seen some of his movies.
<Espeon> 06!pokemon
<Bygios> Espeon, you are a 10Growlithe.
<Barry> Like Avatar?
<Espeon> 06Hmm, fine with this
<FiveYearOldDamos> I need 100% though
<TurniBrony> Like The Terminator and that one. :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13rarr
<Espeon> 06Rawr indeed >:3
<FiveYearOldDamos> toot
<Barry> I did see some of Avatar, but I didn't watch any of the Terminator movies
<TurniBrony> There was also Titanic. And Aliens. And The Abyss.
<FiveYearOldDamos> both of you should have a rawring contest
<Barry> I saw Titanic, but not the other two
<HyperMetalLugia> !pokemon
<Bygios> HyperMetalLugia, you are a 14Gardevoir.
<FiveYearOldDamos> ill give the winner a cookie
<Barry> I think Cameron was the only person to get away with full frontal female nudity in a PG-13 film
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd rather have a meowing contest :P
<FiveYearOldDamos> thats good too
<TurniBrony> I think there might have been some in the Rollerball remake.
<Barry> And I'm talking about that one scene in Titanic
<TurniBrony> But that remake sucked balls. So noone cares.
<FiveYearOldDamos> 5,4,3,2,1, Thunderbirds are go
<Barry> granted, the nudity in Titanic might have been a pan shot, but still...
<Angel_Espeon> 13I remember when I first heard about Thunderbirds years ago
<Angel_Espeon> 13I got excited thinking it was literally about thunder birds
<Angel_Espeon> 13I was disappointed
<TurniBrony> I can't even remember a whole lot of Titanic. Only that I'm still bitterly clinging on to my hate of it. :P
<FiveYearOldDamos> lol
<Barry> ah. Why do you hate it?
<Espeon> 06Meowing contest o.o, and lol
<FiveYearOldDamos> i heard about it off of a chasing video
<TurniBrony> When I was a kid. My sister watched it all the time. And I didn't have anything better to do than to just watch whatever was on the TV. :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd win, of course ;3
<FiveYearOldDamos> perfect little angel
<Barry> hm
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3c
<Barry> Do you hate it because they "killed off" Leonardo Dicaprio?
<TurniBrony> Why would I? I hated him too. :P
<Barry> lol
<Espeon> 06More like
<Angel_Espeon> 13On another note, I gave myself too much mayo to eat with this pasty
<Espeon> 06purrfect
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'll find a way of using it all up though, I always do |D
<Espeon> 06And I don't even like mayo, even less when there's too much .-.
<TurniBrony> Stupid hearthrob for teen girls. :P
<Espeon> 06right
<Espeon> 06:3
<Barry> He was the movie version of an OC
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lies
<Angel_Espeon> 13you're in denial
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<Barry> or his character was
<Espeon> 06Mayo denial, lol
<Espeon> 06MAYBE
<TurniBrony> So I swore never to watch any movie with him in it.
<FiveYearOldDamos> purrmayo
<Angel_Espeon> 13That's ok though, that means I can have your portion of mayo too :D
<Angel_Espeon> 13and wow that could be weird taken out of context LOL
<TurniBrony> Then ofcourse he had to become a serious actor and be in interesting looking movies like Inception and Shutter Island. :P
<lightlugia> purrmayo
<lightlugia> AKA
<lightlugia> mayo with hair

<TurniBrony> Awh well.

<Umbreon> 12if everyone had a portal gun
<Nick> hi skylands
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd shoot a portal into my floor and one on the ceiling directly above it, that'd keep me entertained for weeks |D

<Micro_Nick> wow the lizard looked crap in the 60's cartoon :\

<Skylands> 10Speaking of the relation map, one of my sister's friends walked in the room with that page up and asked if it was math homework XD

<Skylands> 10Some sort of plotting points type thing

<NightSeas> 12lol
<prince-dari> He was on not that long ago.
<Skylands> 10Yes, too confusing
<NightSeas> 12It does look complicated like that XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13especially when it constantly changes
*Skylands imagines it changing every second of the day
<WontBeUsed> alright thanks for the heads up ill be checkin in every once in a while
<Espeon> 06wow, it really does look rather crazy atm
<WontBeUsed> but honestly thanks!
<Skylands> 10Probably more crazy than Espeon's flop avatar
<Espeon> 06Angel_Espeon close to the middle :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13I didn't realise I talked that much LOL
<Espeon> 06And yay me actually typing Angel_Espeon instead of AE is making the line between us more noticable

<Chimera> 04Dear Chimera,
<Chimera> 04As you may be aware, the SEGA Pass system has been offline since yesterday, Thursday 16 June.
<Chimera> 04Over the last 24 hours we have identified that unauthorised entry was gained to our SEGA Pass database.
<Chimera> 04We immediately took the appropriate action to protect our consumers’ data and isolate the location of the breach. We have launched an investigation into the extent of the breach of our public systems.
<Chimera> 04We have identified that a subset of SEGA Pass members emails addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords were obtained. To stress, none of the passwords obtained were stored in plain text.
<Chimera> 04OH JUST GREAT.
<SilverSonic> o.o
<Chimera> 04I swear if my password is the same it's been for years on that site I'm going to have a freaking coniption.

<Lati> 12are you sure you're not a Grimer in disguise?
<Lati> 12pretending to me an Espeon? ;o
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't like the thought of that LOL
<Lati> 12be*
*Espeon proves it.
<NightSeas> 12Hello Lati :3

<Chimera> 04Aurora
<Chimera> 04Apparently someone got my password
<Angel_Espeon> 13.w.
<Micro_Nick> "Angel_Espeon	Don't abuse my imagination please"
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera, you didn't hear that Sega was hacked?
<Chimera> 04and a bunch of other people's passwords
<drfsupercenter> 03I heard about it a few days ago
<Micro_Nick> ESPEON IS THE WORST EEVEELUTION!!!1
<Chimera> 04Nope
<drfsupercenter> 03well they got hacked
<Micro_Nick> HAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA
<drfsupercenter> 03enjoy
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Chimera> 04F***ing Lulzsec.
<drfsupercenter> 03I love those guys
<Chimera> 04What's wrong with them :|
<prince-dari> Lulzsec denied doing that.
<Chimera> 04WHY
<Micro_Nick> oh yeah sega
<Chimera> 04oh
<drfsupercenter> 03because they showed Sony who's boss
<prince-dari> And they are the kind of people who boast about what they hack.
<Chimera> 04well for THAT that was awesome
<prince-dari> So I don't think it was them.
<Chimera> 04mainly because I don't like Sony
<Chimera> 04k
<drfsupercenter> 03Chimera, finally we agree in our dislikes XD
<prince-dari> They even offered advice or support apparently.
<Chimera> 04And th3j3st3r is a good guy (kinda)
<drfsupercenter> 03LL didn't know why I hated Sony
<Aurora> why is it that people are supporting these lulzsec?
<drfsupercenter> 03then I told her about rootkits
<drfsupercenter> 03and she was like WHY
<drfsupercenter> 03and I was like exactly, this is why I hate them
<Chimera> 04I don't like Lulzse
<Chimera> 04c
<prince-dari> Because Lulzsec hacked Sony.
<Chimera> 04but I liked the SONY hack |D
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly.
<Aurora> 6and?
<prince-dari> And Sony can GTFO.
<drfsupercenter> 03Sony is evil and needs to go die in a fire?
<drfsupercenter> 03what prince-dari said.
<Aurora> 6you're evil and you can go die in a fire?
<Aurora> 6I don't see the point here
<Lati> 12I can't remember where I put my passport
*Lati attempts to go find it
<drfsupercenter> 03I just think they're awesome for not being afraid to publically admit that they hacked Sony
<Chimera> 04lol Roara
<drfsupercenter> 03and the fact that PSN was down for like a month
<Chimera> 04Drf
<drfsupercenter> 03all those people who complain about Xbox Live
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm like
<Chimera> 04they admitted it because they're pretentious.
<Chimera> 04"OH LOOK WE HAXX'D SONY"
<drfsupercenter> 03go take your free online and enjoy not having it for a month while continue playing online :D
<Chimera> 04As awesome as that was
<Chimera> 04"OH LOOK WE HACKED *company*" is just stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03unless said company is Sony
<drfsupercenter> 03in which case it's awesome.
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Espeon> 06I won't even say what everyone knows I will say, because I think it's not even needed by now :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I wonder how cheap one can get a computer case in the UK
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm trying to buy computer parts as a gift for someone
<drfsupercenter> 03getting the processor and stuff over here is a whole lot cheaper
<drfsupercenter> 03but sending a case via international mail would be outrageously expensie LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03*expensive
<Kyu> 07!espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Kyu for 14 minutes
<Espeon> 06Kyu lives

<drfsupercenter> 03http://forum.digital-digest.com/showthread.php?t=94957
*Micro_Nick sits on Kyu's head
<drfsupercenter> 03I posted this here the other day
<drfsupercenter> 03saying you would be mad
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03"No group has yet taken responsibility for the incident, but hacking group LulzSec, in the news recently for hacking a series of high profile targets including Sony Pictures, PBS and even the official website of the US Senate, seems to have denied being responsible for this latest attack, and have even offered help to Sega to track down those responsible. "We want to help you destroy the hackers that attacked yo
<drfsupercenter> 03though LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03only 1.29 million people used Sega's website?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's kinda sad given how many people are on the planet
<Barry> hello
<Barry> Just letting you guys know I'm still here
<prince-dari> 1.29 million, the first episode of MLP on youtube has 1 million. XD
<drfsupercenter> 03why does everybody have to relate everything to MLP
<drfsupercenter> 03Seriously, I just don't care.
<Kyu> 07your point?
<prince-dari> You clearly do care, you make such a quick and serious response.
<Aurora> 6that's how he is for everything just ignore it
<Kyu> 07exactly lol
<HyperMetalLugia> Well you'd be quick to say something if it annoys you that much...
<HyperMetalLugia> But oh well, silly Lulzsec
<drfsupercenter> 03^ @ HML
<Aurora> 6which is everything
<Aurora> 6@HML
<drfsupercenter> 03not really
<Aurora> 6but again, ignore it
<prince-dari> Will do.
<drfsupercenter> 03though I do love how people think I get annoyed by everything
<prince-dari> Are you sure it doesn't annoy you?
*prince-dari runs.
<Kyu> 07DRF gets annoyed at a heck of a lot of stuff, and we get annoyed that he gets annoyed. world keeps spinning. no miscommunication
<Kyu> 07</O'Reilly>
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I get annoyued by things that are popular for no reason.
<Aurora> 6lol O'Reilly
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like how everybody hates Justin Beiber
<HyperMetalLugia> Like Zunes- oh, those aren't too popular
<drfsupercenter> 03just because he's popular
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Aurora> 6I have a reson for respecting Justin Beiber, doesn't mean I like his songs, voice, whatever
<Aurora> 6because it makes my ears bleed
<Kyu> 07XD
<Aurora> 6stereotyping things as "popular for no reason" is silly
<drfsupercenter> 03orly
<Aurora> 6because people do have reasons, just reasons you'd probably deem stupid
<drfsupercenter> 03lots of things are popular for no reason
<Aurora> 6therefore, not legit
<drfsupercenter> 03example A: Paris Hilton
<HyperMetalLugia> Who is she?
<HyperMetalLugia> O.o
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh,nvm
<drfsupercenter> 03she was popular a while back
<drfsupercenter> 03all over the tabloids and stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03though she didn't even do anything
<Aurora> 6because she was stupid
<Angel_Espeon> 13The fact that she has a show where she tries to find a bff amuses me
<drfsupercenter> 03but she was popular for no reason
<drfsupercenter> 03which proves that it happens a lot
<Aurora> 6people liked laughing at her
<Kyu> 07you mean like the Kardashians now
<Kyu> 07:'D
*Aurora 6shrugs
<drfsupercenter> 03maybe?
<drfsupercenter> 03then there's things like that Rebecca Black song
<drfsupercenter> 03everybody hated it but yet it was popular
<drfsupercenter> 03popular for no good reason
<Kyu> 07they have a reality show for like...no reason o3o
<drfsupercenter> 03emphasis on *good* reason
<drfsupercenter> 03it may be a BAD reason though
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nearly all reality shows have no real reason to them
<drfsupercenter> 03something that everybody knows of because of how hated it is doesn't really qualify as popular IMO
<Aurora> 6 13:12	drfsupercenter	lots of things are popular for no reason <- you said NO reason
<Kyu> 07people being ironic and listening to Friday is why it was "popular"
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I'm not popular
*drfsupercenter runs
<Kyu> 07:'D
<Aurora> 6which is different
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<drfsupercenter> 03typo
<drfsupercenter> 03I meant to say no good reason LOL
<Aurora> 6you said it 4 times lol
<drfsupercenter> 03OK you know what
<HyperMetalLugia> Copypaste
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<Espeon> 06The rebecca black song was really the
<drfsupercenter> 03now you're being as critical as I am :P
<Espeon> 06"can't stop watching the train wreck" thing if you ask me
<Aurora> 6I'd have to do it quite often
*Espeon hides
<Aurora> 6but yep, I'm done
<drfsupercenter> 03also wtf is wrong with my phone
<drfsupercenter> 03I just did a factory reset and the thing won't turn on
<Espeon> 06But I do agree, jumping on bandwagons = stoopid in general.
<drfsupercenter> 03I think I broke it
<drfsupercenter> 03so nobody try doing a rm -rf / on a phone
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not good
*drfsupercenter hides
<drfsupercenter> 03I did it for kicks
<drfsupercenter> 03didn't realize doing that would erase my backup image from before I did it >_>
<drfsupercenter> 03...LMAO
<drfsupercenter> 03best post ever
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<drfsupercenter> 03"Microsoft is being very smart with this. I wonder what Sony would have done in the same situation that would not have included their lawyers. " <- reply to a thread about Microsoft releasing a beta SDK kit for the Kinect on PC
<drfsupercenter> 03because hackers made it work
*HyperMetalLugia thinks of a Star Wars reference for DRF's phone fail
<HyperMetalLugia> .v.
<prince-dari> People made is work on PS3 too.
<HyperMetalLugia> I give up, continue

<Lati> 12Darn it passport, I need to learn to take better care of my things
<Lati> 12I bet I threw it somewhere under the bed

<Espeon> 06hi o.o
<SilverSonic> http://www.mediafire.com/?o01vlmu691556ea ;D New demo
<Skylands> 10NightSeas, I'm moving your topic to Forum Games because people tend to post their results more than once and it boosts their postcount
<NightSeas> 12lol, but it's not a game o-o
<Espeon> 06Other threads that encourage posting in them "often" have been moved to.
<Espeon> 06And the interesting part - they instantly died when post count was no longer counted :P
<Skylands> 10Exactly
*Quanyails 7hmms.
<NightSeas> 12Ah, but people are not going to feel like doing that test to many times
<Skylands> 10I did XD
<NightSeas> 12lol
<Skylands> 10First got around 70-ish, then kept trying
*Quanyails 7has an old record somewhere.
<NightSeas> 12Well, okay I guess it can be moved, lol

<Chimera> 04After playing Super Mario 64 again, I looked up Throwback Galaxy on Youtube, and I saw how the walls have chips in them
<NightSeas> 12I guess It will be funner that way, because people won’t have to worry about spaming it XD
<Chimera> 04Just like what happens when you try getting the star in Super Mario 64
<Chimera> 04DANG that's authentic XD
<NightSeas> 12True XD
<Umbreon> 12okay drf
<Umbreon> 12i'm fairly sure it's the key itself
<Umbreon> 12XD
*Nick still regrets giving his N64 away T________T
<Nick> WHAT WAS I THINKIIIIIIIIING!
<Nick> ?
<Nick> ASDF
<Skylands> 10Skychu
<Espeon> 06Espychu
<Espeon> 06just no
<Espeon> 06.-.
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Quanyails> 7I'm spriting.
<NightSeas> 12Hmm, you can download 21 of the N64 games with wii points, Nick
<Quanyails> 7</random>
*Kyu chews Espy
<NightSeas> 12Nightchu
<Creideiki> Hmm... it appears someone at HP must be lacking in the brain department.
<Chimera> 04http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Super_Mario_64_DS-Graphics_comparison.jpg
<Chimera> 04oh WOW
<Creideiki> I state that becuase... well if one gets an HP16700A logic analyser... one doesn't get the software to dev for it. The software costs ... a lot. However... "Oh hey, what's on the logic analyser hard disk? ... KEYGENS!? ... Today is a good day for warez."
<NightSeas> 12That's not all, the 3DS has even better graphics then the wii I think
<Nick> hmm looking at those screens the n64 version actually probably had the better graphics in terms of colour and detail
<Jasper> K
<NightSeas> 12True
<Nick> I can see the refinement on the angles in the DS version but it kinda looks like they lost the detail, I mean look at the floor and Bowser's back shell
<Chimera> 04That's probably differences in color contrast
<Nick> yeah
<Skylands> 10Wb
<Angel_Espeon> 13Thanks~
<NightSeas> 12Hi Angel_Espeon

<drf-Droid> ^ @ SS
<NightSeas> 12Even older then I like MLP conversations
<prince-dari> You note that I only posted one MLP link when no one had said anything for 8 minutes.
<drf-Droid> you mentioned that twilight crap
<HyperMetalLugia> Well it gets boring after you notice how unactive the chat can be at times
<NightSeas> 12Twilight is a pony and has nothing to do with the books/movies
<prince-dari> You guys weren't even talking when I started posting.
<prince-dari> So why have you got to come back all of a sudden and whine when I did?
<drf-Droid> keyword is pony
<SilverSonic> -.-'
<prince-dari> drf needs to be about 20% cooler.
<drf-Droid> so SS and HML agree with me that the MLP crap id snnoying?
<drf-Droid> *a
<SilverSonic> yes.
<SilverSonic> Easy Solution: Make a Pony Channel, Put the "bronys" in there. and Keep ALL conversations about MLP THAT CHANNEL

<Cynder7> 6And Dari also gives a nice SR quote too..
<HyperMetalLugia> Maybe because they're all in proper mental institutions?

<SilverSonic> drf, simple: Gline anyone who spams MLP :P
<drf-Droid> someone change the subject
<HyperMetalLugia> < Cry

<Ascendant> besides you guys
<SilverSonic> ^
<drf-Droid> ^
<drf-Droid> Ascendant, put a block on it again XD
<Ascendant> Am I making myself clear? seriously, we don't want that in here
<HyperMetalLugia> Care= 3-7/30th
<Ascendant> I'm lazy, about to go
<prince-dari> Most people are mature enough to STFU instead of whine, there aren't rules about the topic.
<HyperMetalLugia> Aka. Only 15% cars
<HyperMetalLugia> *cares

<Tran_Pham> 13Okay so what is your favourite type of dogs?

<Ascendant> not everyone in here completely cares
*eXAKR stuffs more Tentacruels into cars
<Ascendant> the majority of active people, lol
<prince-dari> It's just a few people in here who whine non-stop.
<drf-Droid> prince-dari
<Tran_Pham> 13My is dashund dog (I forgot how to spell it).

<eXAKR> You are the one who created the Brony channel
<Ascendant> there's no real big deal, but it's starting to get really annoying
<prince-dari> No one was even talking when I started talking, they only came back to complain to me for posting anything in the first place.
<Icy> 12I know dear
<prince-dari> Then they didn't start their own topic.
<eXAKR> OK, let's talk about Explosion Day.
<Ascendant> because no one wants the ponies.
<prince-dari> They GTFO'd till I posted something again, then whined.
<drf-Droid> Ascendant
<Tran_Pham> 13Yeah. I want a Dachshund dog someday.
<Ascendant> ?
<drf-Droid> change the topic lol

<drf-Droid> isn't there a rule about link spamming?
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol you make such a big deal about ponies

<drf-Droid> you post one spam link, so you post more and nobody looks because of the first.
<prince-dari> One spam link?
<eXAKR> So spamming non-fads are OK
<drf-Droid> yes
<prince-dari> How do you spam one link?
<Umbreon> 12eXAKR
<eXAKR> You guys have upside-down logic
<SilverSonic> No exakr, spamming is bad period

<SilverSonic> welcome drf
<Skylands> 10It's as bad as me posting Puella Magi everywhere
<Umbreon> 12in fact
<drf-Droid> someone want to make a poll on the forums?
<HyperMetalLugia> I hate it when Skylands and everyone else talks about Puella Magica;p
<Icy> 12kh bbs, portal 2, and gta
<HyperMetalLugia> Skylands, make it plz
<NightSeas> 12This conversation needs to end, and you do post Puella Magi everywhere XD
<UmbreHelanga> 12there

<Skylands> 10[21:08] <%drf-Droid> someone want to make a poll on the forums? <- Do it
<Skylands> 10Seriously
<UmbreHelanga> 12any objections drf?
<drf-Droid> no
<drf-Droid> because
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh, wait
<drf-Droid> if I do
<drf-Droid> people rage
<HyperMetalLugia> There is no point with the poll now :|
<SilverSonic> so what
<Kosoveon> i understand everyone has something that they obsess about, but throwing that obsession into people's faces all the time is irritating, not funny or cool
<drf-Droid> so someone else do it
<SilverSonic> do it anyways
<prince-dari> You guys are raging anyway.
<HyperMetalLugia> Since everyone else is going to vote against us
<prince-dari> So what difference does it make?
<Skylands> 10[21:08] <NightSeas> This conversation needs to end, and you do post Puella Magi everywhere XD <- Yes, but at least when I post it it's not randomly like eXAKR
<Tran_Pham> 13Not sure for me but I think my favourite game is NiGHTS Journey of Dreams and The Legend of Spyro The Eternal Night.
<drf-Droid> yay kosovo is with ud
<Skylands> 10When most of the time no pony fans are on
<eXAKR> Aero was throwing her Zero obsession everywhere

<Skylands> 10and yesterday I had a bunch of links I PMed her
<Skylands> 10So yeah
<drf-Droid> skylands make a poll for me? :P

<Ascendant> he's not ranting
<HyperMetalLugia> So I don't see the spam ;3
<drf-Droid> LOL HML
<prince-dari> So it would have been better that I leave the channel than post ONE link?
<SilverSonic> LOL
<Ascendant> lmao
<prince-dari> I don't understand. No one was even talking.
<UmbreHelanga> 12i have everyone on ignore
*UmbreHelanga is so lonely;-;
<Ascendant> prince-dari, post it somewhere else
<drf-Droid> prince_dari
<eXAKR> ...
<Ascendant> -> /ignore *@*
<drf-Droid> you posted more than one link.
<prince-dari> Yeah, one MLP link, that's the only thing you guys objected to.
<prince-dari> The rest is irrelevant, no one cared about them.
<drf-Droid> I didn't look at the rest on principle.
<prince-dari> No one talks, I post one link, massive RAGE at me.
<Ascendant> you've posted more
<SilverSonic> ^
<drf-Droid> ^
<Ascendant> I'd be fine with it if it was the ONLY link you've ever posted
<eXAKR> How did this start anyway
<Ascendant> in relations to MLP
<Ascendant> but the repetition is quite annoying
<prince-dari> I've posted something like a total of 10 MLP links on this channel over 2 weeks.
<drf-Droid> ^
<Ascendant> and frankly, no one even wants to watch it
<SilverSonic> ^
<drf-Droid> ^
<eXAKR> People have gushed over other things
<eXAKR> No one cares
<SilverSonic> yeah
<eXAKR> People gushing over ponies
<Ascendant> yeah, they have
<SilverSonic> cause they dont spam it here
<SilverSonic> ;p
<Ascendant> but
<drf-Droid> no one cares about eXAKR
<eXAKR> "EETS ANNOYING"
<eXAKR> I gush over bendy buses
<SilverSonic> LOL drf
<HyperMetalLugia> Well a show full of girls
<Ascendant> the majority of people in here DOESN'T want to see MLP in this channel
<NightSeas> 12.-.
<eXAKR> Bendy buses
<eXAKR> Bendy buses
<eXAKR> Bendy buses
<eXAKR> Bendy buses

<eXAKR> Bendy buses
<HyperMetalLugia> Is bound to get annoying
<Ascendant> don't*
<eXAKR> No one cares
<Ascendant> Don't spam
<SilverSonic> Exakr that was just plain spam there
<Ascendant> lol
<eXAKR> Make it a vote, shall we?
<Icy> 12Kingdom hearts birth by sleep, portal 2, grand theft auto
<Ascendant> Sure
<HyperMetalLugia> You know..the only reason why MLP is even here
<HyperMetalLugia> Is since Arti likes it
<Ascendant> Make it on the forums
<HyperMetalLugia> So yeah...
<drf-Droid> yeah
<prince-dari> I don't see you guys are so bothered.
<Tran_Pham> 13I see.
<drf-Droid> anf
<drf-Droid> d
<Icy> 12Icy
<NightSeas> 12No, a pull would make our forum look stupid to new people
<drf-Droid> only chat users are allowed to vote
<prince-dari> You can just ignore it.
<drf-Droid> NightSeas
<Tran_Pham> 13?
<prince-dari> It's hardly a GREAT TRAVESTY THAT CANNOT GO UNPUNISHED.
<drf-Droid> people like you make TD
<Ascendant> NightSeas
<drf-Droid> TST look dtupif
<drf-Droid> *stupid
<drf-Droid> :)
<Ascendant> maybe you should shut your mouth before you say something even more stupid?
<drf-Droid> ^
<eXAKR> Ascendant
<eXAKR> IT'S JUST PONIES
<prince-dari> You guys are such drama queens. :P
<drf-Droid> ascendant
<Ascendant> it's not drama lol
<eXAKR> IF YOU ARE SO ANNOYED BY PONIES
<prince-dari> You serious?
<eXAKR> GO LIVE ON THE MOON
<Ascendant> derp
<drf-Droid> can you ban him with reason ITS JUST A BAN
*drf-Droid hide
<drf-Droid> s
<Ascendant> lmao
<SilverSonic> lmfao
<prince-dari> I see things I don't agree with and don't like all the time.
<HyperMetalLugia> whoa
<HyperMetalLugia> I pulled my CD drive out
<prince-dari> I don't feel the need to jump on that person and berate them.
<eXAKR> I can at least agree if people are saying they are annoyed by Ben 10 or some other thrash cartoon
<HyperMetalLugia> Windows XP froze
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<prince-dari> You guys are just making drama.
<eXAKR> I'm with prince-dari here
<drf-Droid> LOL @ HML
<Ascendant> lol it's not exactly drama
<HyperMetalLugia> Laptops FTW :D
<Ascendant> and lmao HML
<drf-Droid> and prince-dari, then stop throwing fuel on the fire.
<Ascendant> windows bawwwwwwwwwwwws
<HyperMetalLugia> Yeah, I learned my lesson with that
<Ascendant> did you get a BSOD? >:
<NightSeas> 12I got some awesome 5th gen Pokemon cards a few days ago :3
<prince-dari> There wouldn't be a fire is you guys grew up a bit, and ignored things that nanoyed you.
<prince-dari> if*
<drf-Droid> you know we hate MLP links, so don't post them here.
<SilverSonic> ^
<Ascendant> Well, that is hard to do when you have people posting it left and right
<Ascendant> and you don't want to ignore those people
<drf-Droid> ^
<Ascendant> overall
<Icy> 12lol nothin
<Ascendant> because they might have some intelligence
<prince-dari> MLP is hardly a big topic on the chat, I wouldn't know about the forum.
<eXAKR> http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa312/eonity/1295485631356-n1296016314480.png
<Ascendant> and can post things other than MLP
<drf-Droid> pd
<drf-Droid> people are changing their usernames, avatars, and sigs to MLP
<HyperMetalLugia> I didn't get a BSOD :F
<drf-Droid> tell me that isn't overkill.
<HyperMetalLugia> Not at all
<Tran_Pham> 13XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Until they live in a barn
<Skylands> 10Erm, MLP is worse here than the forum
<HyperMetalLugia> Eat carrots
<Ascendant> what Skylands said
<eXAKR> How so Skylands
*NightSeas glares at overkill
<Skylands> 10Because forum-goers aren't posting it everywhere
<drf-Droid> ^
<Skylands> 10They keep it in ONE thread
<Ascendant> at least the forum guys don't shove MLP in everyone's face when they post, besides having obnoxious avatars/sigs
<drf-Droid> yep
<Icy> 12*troll*
<Ascendant> yeah
<drf-Droid> that's why MAKE YOUR OWN CHANNEL AND STOP POSTING MLP HERE
<SilverSonic> ^
<Skylands> 10and I don't mind MLP avatars/sigs
<drf-Droid> I propose a new rule :P
<Skylands> 10It's just the continuous image macros
<NightSeas> 12Okay, lets create #ponies
<Ascendant> I'll make a poll/topic when I get home
<HyperMetalLugia> Guys.,..
<HyperMetalLugia> I already created a channel derp
<Ascendant> lol image macros
<HyperMetalLugia> Just go there already XD
<drf-Droid> let gl do it
<prince-dari> So any interest you have other than one directly related to pokemon must have its own channel and you can't post it anywhere but there?
<Tran_Pham> 13Yup.
<eXAKR> Guys
<eXAKR> Join #ponies
<Ascendant> and HML your channel doesn't need to exist
<eXAKR> bettaru
<drf-Droid> make him feel special
<HyperMetalLugia> Great ;D

<Tran_Pham> 13What should we talk about again?
<prince-dari> I'll repost it...
<Ascendant> k
<prince-dari> So any interest you have other than one directly related to pokemon must have its own channel and you can't post it anywhere but there?
<Skylands> 10If it's excessive, yes
<drf-Droid> ^
<prince-dari> If it's excessive...
<prince-dari> You guys only think it's excessive because people posted it on the forum first.
<Icy> 12http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lls43izMU01qaaowno1_400.jpg
<drf-Droid> nope.avi
<prince-dari> If it had just been what I'd posted on here you wouldn't mind, because I've not posted that muchh related to MLP on here.
<Ascendant> prince-dari
<Ascendant> half of us aren't even active
<Ascendant> on the forums
<Tran_Pham> 13You wanted to talk about that, correct?
<NightSeas> 12And that topic wil make Arti go wtf

<eXAKR> I can't believe drama over MLP:FiM content
<Ascendant> It's not drama
<Skylands> 10I can't believe you bringing it back up :P
<NightSeas> 12What do you think, NS? Will Arti think that topic ii O_o
<HyperMetalLugia> I can't believe the fad over MLP :<
<drf-Droid> I can't believe eXAKR won't give up

<HyperMetalLugia> Peas Plz
*Skylands will post it on peas
<drf-Droid> unless she already did

<eXAKR> I once had a piece of plastic stuck inside the Enter key on my old keyboard
<drf-Droid> then fixed it XD
<eXAKR> It acted funny
<UmbreHelanga> 12and i saw that each end of the wire slides into an a metal hole of sorts
<UmbreHelanga> 12and one of those were bent down
<eXAKR> What kind of keyboard do you use UmbreHelanga?

<NightSeas> 12AH
<prince-dari> You can go over to http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/what-would-you-ask-jayson-thiessen.html
<prince-dari> And post questions for the supervising director of the show.
<NightSeas> 12Also: * SilverSonic (navs_sonic@bal-bb-cable-2-419.dsl.airstreamcomm.net) has joined #ponies <-- Kinda made me lol XDD
<prince-dari> Haha.
<Skylands> 10What do you have against Americans?
<Lambda> someone asked if Luna was nased on the brony fandom
<Lambda> she sorta came before them...
<NightSeas> 12Too bad It only lasted two seconds
<prince-dari> They meant if they're going to base her character on.
<prince-dari> Since she doesn't really have one yet.
<prince-dari> I think making anything really big decided by the fans is probably a bad idea though.
<Lambda> well they specifically asked IS her personality based on
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Lambda> them
<prince-dari> Hmm, I don't understand why people are so hostile. :o
<Archfiend> well you said US ALL
<Archfiend> so USA could be the acronym...?
<prince-dari> Ah yeah.
<prince-dari> But I think they mean because they're assuming that a lot of series 2 is already planned.
<NightSeas> 12Yeah, no one seems to care when you spam other shows XD
<prince-dari> So it's already fixed "Is is inspired by" rather than "Will it be inspired by".
<Lambda> [21:31] <@prince-dari> I think making anything really big decided by the fans is probably a bad idea though. <- I agree, though I do like seeing small things recognizing the fandom though
<prince-dari> Is it*
<Lambda> ah, I see what you mean
<prince-dari> Small things are good.
<Lambda> indeed
<Lambda> like DJ-P0n3
<Lambda> and Derpy
<prince-dari> That was the epitomy of awesome.
<prince-dari> Equestria Girls. XD
<prince-dari> My head exploded.
<prince-dari> Small things are much better.
<Lambda> I heard california gurls on the radio at work
<NightSeas> 12But if you just post one link to MLP, everyone is all "Baaaaaaawww I hate that show"
<Lambda> before Katy Perry started singing I was totally thinking "Is this really equestria girls? On the radio?! YAY!"
<prince-dari> Yeah, one MLP link, they whine. I posted about 20 Spiderman links and nothing.
<prince-dari> Absolutely nothing. O_o
<prince-dari> LOL
<Lambda> then I remembered it was based on a real song that sucked
<prince-dari> That'd be so cool.
<Lambda> I was sadface for a while
<prince-dari> Ponies make bad songs better though.
<NightSeas> 12Yeah sometimes they even like it when you give links to other shows
<Lambda> they do indeed
<prince-dari> I mean watch that, the original songs aren't good by themselves, but add ponies and they become awesome together.
<Lambda> Haha
<Lambda> will do
<Skylands> 10k
<prince-dari> Ah well, I won't pretend to understand the way people think then. XD
<Archfiend> bbl
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 5Ampharos.
<Lambda> XD
<SilverSonic> LL where is the potion shop?!
<SilverSonic> o3o
<NightSeas> 12And lol, there’s actually only a few people that don’t like the show in #silverwings. But unfortunately, they all happen to be mods
<SilverSonic> i mean where in the village
<Lambda> I love the RD/kissed a girl part
<Lambda> XD
<NightSeas> 12Except for SS, he’s not a mod.
<prince-dari> Heheh.
<NightSeas> 12But he's backed up by them
<prince-dari> I'm used to drf complaining about things by now.
<SilverSonic> Oh wait
<SilverSonic> i see where you said it nao XD
<prince-dari> I don't understand why so many other people have such a strong aversion to MLP though.
<prince-dari> Maybe it challenges their masculinity (all the people who object seem to be male XD).
<prince-dari> Well Ascendant doesn't like it either, but most of the people who complain.
<NightSeas> 12Well, Ascendant said that she actually don’t think anything of it to me.
<prince-dari> Hmm, well earlier today she said she found it annoying too.
<NightSeas> 12However, she was in a good mood that day XD
<prince-dari> Haha. XD
<drfsupercenter> 03aww what happened to the topic
<HyperMetalLugia> WB DRF

<drfsupercenter> 03<HyperMetalLugia> Isn't it for the PCI-ports *derps* <- yeah

<drfsupercenter> 03one thing I'll admit that's better

<Aurora> 6terrifying
<prince-dari> The transition between poop3 and 4 is much larger than the transition between poop4 and 5, they pretty much reworked the whole system with poop4, and poop5 is more working with updating that system rather than overhauling.

<FiveYearOldDamos> sure

<Cynder7> 6I even have a special Icy edition.. :P
<TurniBrony> I allready played this game on my Megadrive. ;P
<UxieLover> 11Looks nice
<Cynder7> 6Thanks :P
<lightlugia> dentist went good
<lightlugia> phew....nothing wrong with my teeth
<UxieLover> 11Come on, Icy...
<EccoCode> That's always good news.
<Barry> How? It's not set for release until November 22, 2011?
<Cynder7> 6He tends to be on by this time,right?
<UxieLover> 11Yep!
<Barry> And the graphics are leaps and bounds ahead of Megadrive
<TurniBrony> Not the gameplay though. :P
<Barry> Maybe classic sonic, but Modern Sonic takes a lot of things from Unleashed and Colors
<Barry> both of which are 2010 games
<Cynder7> 6Gah..GET THE HELL ON HERE ICY.
<TurniBrony> Well. I haven't played them.
<UxieLover> 11Icy! We want you to come on!
<Barry> true
<Cynder7> 6ICY!
<Barry> I've played Unleashed, and it's pretty good
<Cynder7> 6ICY!
<Cynder7> 6ICY!
<TurniBrony> I gave up after finding out Sonic Adventure had the same problems that Sonic Heroes and Shadow the Hedgehog had.
<UxieLover> 11ICY!
<Barry> It's gameplay is much different from Sonic
<Barry> Sonic '06
<Barry> I had very little problems with glitches
<Cynder7> 6D:
<Cynder7> 6ICYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<Barry> I also don't know what problems Sonic Adventure and Sonic Heroes had. They were fine. SA2, however...
<RainBroDash> Are you saying you preferred Heroes over SA2?
<Barry> Yep
<TurniBrony> SA and Sonic Heroes. Take a guess. Controlls, Camera.
<RainBroDash> O_O
<Barry> SA2 was good, don't get me wrong.
<Barry> but it had some problems that would kill it for others
<RainBroDash> I loved SA2, problems or not. I thought Heroes was a gimmicky pile of crap to be honest :P
<RainBroDash> This is when I was a bit younger, mind you
<Barry> I will admit it Heroes had bad voice acting
<TurniBrony> Sonic has allways had bad voice acting.
<Barry> but Unleashed and Colors doesn't
<RainBroDash> but SA2 was one of my most played games when I was younger, it had quite a bit of replay value for me and a friend of mine
<Barry> don't*
<Barry> Especially Colors
<Barry> On the Wii especially
<RainBroDash> I didn't play any after Heroes, if anything replayed Adventure, and had a mild perusing of SA2 for the nostalgia
<UxieLover> 11Dónde estás, Icy?
<Barry> Yeah, well, if you go into something, expecting it to be bad, it will be
<TurniBrony> Well. I expected Sonic Adventure to be great. :P
<Barry> It was the first time Sonic went 3D
<RainBroDash> I didn't expect Sonic Heroes to be bad, I wanted it to be great. I just hated it
<TurniBrony> First time Sonic went 3D. That's no excuse.
<Barry> Mario 64 wasn't the best of games, hell, the first few games of any 2D game thet suddenly went 3D wasn't as good as future games, with one key exception
<TurniBrony> Mario 64 is leaps and bounds over any 3D sonic outings.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> http://lugialordoftheseas.deviantart.com/art/Mabinogi-Dragons-214430079
<Barry> Ocarina of Time is the only video game that went 3D and did it right
<TurniBrony> Well. Zelda is diffrent from Sonic or Mario.
<Barry> True
<Barry> and Turni, the first time Sonic went 3D is an excuse with the system of the time: Dreamcast
<TurniBrony> There's nothing wrong with the Dreamcast.
<TurniBrony> Except that it sunk itself by not playing DVDs.
<Barry> Then Sega made another mistake: Years later, they took the same games, did nothing to tweak them, and re-released themk on Gamecube
<Barry> them*
<Barry> under different names
<Barry> slightly different names*
<TurniBrony> Well. That's just turning a profit. :P
<Barry> I guess.
<RainBroDash> I never personally owned a Dreamcast, I had a Gamecube, and when they re-released the Director's Cuts for Gamecube I was ecstatic
<RainBroDash> xD
<TurniBrony> I have a Dreamcast. :P
<Barry> I never got to experience them on Dreamcast, so I really don't know if they tweaked them or not
<TurniBrony> I also have the best game on the Dreamcast. Protip: It's Marvel VS Capcom 2. Not any of the shitty Sonic games.
*Cynder7 6feels sleepy..
<TurniBrony> It's glorious.
<UxieLover> 11What time is it where you are?
<Barry> Whatever, I'm just saying you're missing out. They seem to have removed a lot of the glitches that were prevalent in the first few 3D sonic games
<Barry> True, camera can still be an issue, but with behind the back 3D, when isn't it?
<TurniBrony> On good games?
<Cynder7> 6 7:40 pm
<Barry> Nope.
<Barry> Even good 3D games can have camera issues
<TurniBrony> Good games usually doesn't have a problem with cameras or controlls.
<Barry> I'm certain Mario Galaxy did
<Cynder7> 6What about where you are?
<Barry> as did Zelda
<Barry> all 3D games have some kind of issue with the camera if it's not 1st person
<Barry> It just can
<Barry> it just can't be helped*
<TurniBrony> If you're gonna go that route and try to justify it.
<TurniBrony> Some games have more problems than others. Sonic in 3D are some of these.
<TurniBrony> And they're not doing anything to try to fix it.
<UxieLover> 11Late. I am not allowed to tell you the time, however
<TurniBrony> They jumped ship instead and opt for a 2D solution.
<Cynder7> 6Meh :P
<Cynder7> 6Every day I stay on later and later.. o.o
<UxieLover> 11That's the same for me. My dad calls me a nightout
<UxieLover> 11The reason why is because I stay up most of the time
<Cynder7> 6These days I tend to not sleep till 5-6 am.. ._.
<TurniBrony> Guess that's a fair solution. No more embarrasingly bad controlls, and less work. :P
<UxieLover> 11I normally go to bed around before 4am, but not during workdays
<Cynder7> 6Good thing it's summer holidays..
<UxieLover> 11That's right. However, I live in Australia, so it's currently Winter here. It's a good thing I don't go to school anymore, and I only work part time during evenings.
<TurniBrony> Welcome bac
<TurniBrony> k
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Quilava> kewl
<UxieLover> 11Our Summer is unfair. We don't get three months of Holidays. We only get six weeks.
<UxieLover> 11Well, the students do.

<Damos> awww k
<prince-dari> Welp, all my exams are finished now.
<Hipster_Brony> 8so sprinkles, did you happen to catch ponychan's daily shitstorm this morning?
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<SirSprinkles> 6I was sleeping from 9 AM yesterday until 9 AM today. I needed some time to just... relax.
<prince-dari> Wow.
<prince-dari> 10 people on the channel.
<Icydragon> What's minecraft?
<prince-dari> Kjakings.
<prince-dari> Actually on IRC.
<TurniBrony> What shitstorm?
<prince-dari> Shocking.
<Icydragon> Dari...
<DSD> 10Hey Dari
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Hipster_Brony> 8well
<RSpanner> 2Wow
<RSpanner> 2Long time no chat.
<Hipster_Brony> 8some guy posted a thread asking for DashxScootaloo shipping pics
<Hipster_Brony> 8people explained to him that it was basically pedophilia
<Hipster_Brony> 8he said "so what?"
<Icydragon> I cleaned your bathroom... with my tongue...
<SirSprinkles> 6>some guy
<TurniBrony> Lawl
<TurniBrony> Oh internet.
<SirSprinkles> 6Do I have to read this thread I just found called "Friendshipping"?
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was hard to tell if he was trolling or serious
<prince-dari> I hope you didn't forget to clean around my toilet seat.
<Hipster_Brony> 8actually, that friendshipping thread came out of the shitstorm
<Icydragon> Crap, brb
<SirSprinkles> 6Okay, just making sure.
<TurniBrony> Friendshipping. Let that thread sink. ;P
<Hipster_Brony> 8grandil coined the term when people started posting non-shipping pics of Dash and Scootaloo
<TurniBrony> Silly term, but ok.
<Barry> I think the idea for DashxScootaloo came about from the episode "Owl's well that ends well". Didn't Scoots say to Dash that she'd to anything for Dash?
<Hipster_Brony> 8something like that
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats where scootabuse came from
<TurniBrony> Oh fanbase. You so crazy.
<Hipster_Brony> 8which also got posted in the aforementioned thread
<Barry> there's even a fic that takes said comment to it's inevitable extreme
<Barry> the only problem is it's rated adult
<TurniBrony> Is it another crappy Cupcakes ripoff?
<Barry> nope, it's a scootabuse fic
<Barry> with some sexual content thrown in
<prince-dari> Meh sexual content. :/
<Barry> that's all I'll say on the subject
<TurniBrony> I shouldn't be surprised.
<Barry> but by that comment, I'll guess you were
<Hipster_Brony> 8DARI OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE
<TurniBrony> But people watch FiM, and then decide to write that shit.
<Hipster_Brony> 8people are sick
<Barry> indeed.
<Damos> is my connection dead or is it going still?
<Skylands> 10Meep
<Damos> okay good
<Icydragon> K cleaned
<TurniBrony> It's like. "Oooh, yeah. My Little Pony. That's hot! Better write some sex stuff with a minor in it"
<Barry> we don't know the ages of the ponies. For all we know, they're all minors
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats why i dont like shipping
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats even worse
<TurniBrony> Well. Scootaloo is a minor.
<TurniBrony> That's for sure.
<Barry> indeed, she's school age
<prince-dari> I hate it when people do that because then I get associated with people who do that just for liking MLP. :/
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah
<Barry> so are Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle, but I've only seen fics where Apple Bloom is pared with Spike
<Barry> paired*
<Ghosties> 4MI CARA CUANDO
<Hipster_Brony> 8its just happy cartoon ponies
<TurniBrony> Ofcourse. On the net nothing is sacred.
<Hipster_Brony> 8why do people have to make them brutally murder each other and have sex with everything that moves
<Hipster_Brony> 8?
<Ghosties> 4Because people like it
<Hipster_Brony> 8thats a rhetorical question btw
<Barry> Uhh, those Apple BloomxSpike don't have any sexual contemt
<Barry> content*
<prince-dari> Cupcakes was funny though (the one with proper grammar).
<Hipster_Brony> 8even so, the fact that they are in a romantic relationship implies sexuality
<Hipster_Brony> 8when both are clearly too young for it
<TurniBrony> Cupcakes was boring.
<Steve> 12 Hello, Stormy and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Barry> Maybe not
<Hipster_Brony> 8cupcakes scarred me
<Barry> We don't know when a pony is first able to breed
<prince-dari> Well the people I told to read it agreed with me that the puns were pretty good.
<TurniBrony> Cupcakes is just a fanfic in the style of Eli Roth.
<Barry> who?
<Hipster_Brony> 8the guy who did hostel
<prince-dari> Barry: Ponies and breeding. Not want. :
<prince-dari> :
<prince-dari> ...

<Barry> no, it's too late on the day for that. Konichiwa
<prince-dari> Interviews?
<TurniBrony> Well. Maybe it's because Ghosties is invisible.

<prince-dari> Yep.

<SirSprinkles> 6DCD said he'd just leave it since I'll be streaming Saturday streams.
<Icydragon> I'd share, but I can't D:
<TurniBrony> New mods? And you didn't ask me?
<Ghosties> 4*reminder to self: remember to bitch to DCD for making me unable to kick Sprinkles whenever I want to
<Cynder7> 6>.<
<Hipster_Brony> 8we posted about it on our FB and Twitter accounts
<TurniBrony> That's good. Because I don't like responsibility.
<Icydragon> Cheer up :3
*Hipster_Brony 8saw that one coming a mile away
<Ghosties> 4Okay, that's it, I'm joining my own channel. Screw you guys
<SirSprinkles> 6Wait, how many potential new mods are we looking at?
<Hipster_Brony> 8maybe one or two i'd say
<SirSprinkles> 6lol silly Ghosties
<prince-dari> °O° Face thread is still going?
<Ghosties> 4It better be
<Ghosties> 4I was around for its creation
<prince-dari> I posted in it somewhere.
<Ghosties> 4Hell, I was the one who named the original Sweetie Derelle
<prince-dari> With some neverending loop GIF I made.
<Ghosties> 4I finally left my mark on Ponychan
<prince-dari> XD
<Ghosties> 4Now I can edie in peace
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Ghosties> 4*e-die
<Ghosties> 4But it seems people are taking the face and pasting it everywhere instead of the actual Sweetie Derelle
<Hipster_Brony> 8what is this "o" face thread? is it the one about shooping the derelle face on to everything else?
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Cynder7> 6Meh,I'll find some feedance..
<Hipster_Brony> 8god
<Hipster_Brony> 8im sooooo sick of that face already
<Icydragon> Goooood
<Ghosties> 4MWHAHAHAHAHAHA
<prince-dari> Lawl, you guys see the google suggestions box screeny for "Confound" on EQD?
<SirSprinkles> 6I love this "Are we the hippies?" thread
<Hipster_Brony> 8no
<Kjakings> 7Where's Rurik? that bastard promised me SC /alive/
<Ghosties> 4That's news? Really?
<Hipster_Brony> 8awesome
<Cynder7> 6*rurikpoke*
<Hipster_Brony> 8the internet is for ponies
<Icydragon> He lied to you
<prince-dari> John Freemane - protector of ponias.
<Icydragon> No...
<Hipster_Brony> 8sprinkles and ghosties, can you join mod chat?
<prince-dari> Yes.
<Icydragon> Nnnnope
<SirSprinkles> ...I love how the password still hasn't been changed
<Hipster_Brony> dari has to do it
<prince-dari> Well you guys could do it. :P
<prince-dari> Or tell me what to change it to.
<Cynder7> 6DARI LIVES.
<Hipster_Brony> silver tried changing it and it didnt work
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<Icydragon> Nope *pulls him into the room*
<prince-dari> What do you want it changed to?
<Hipster_Brony> honestly, i would be fine keeping it as is
<TurniBrony> If you leave us we'll get lonely. :<
<prince-dari> Ohai room
<SirSprinkles> Where's Ghosties?
<Hipster_Brony> needed the password
<prince-dari> The wormhole disconnected while he was inside.
<prince-dari> He's gone.
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, deal with it.
<Hipster_Brony> wat
<SirSprinkles> 6At least there are two people here. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6I had to talk to myself when I wasn't a mod.
<TurniBrony> Now look who's being mean. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Not mean, just... blunt.
<prince-dari> You had to talk to me while I was busy being away Sprinkles. :P
<Hipster_Brony> 8we have mod business to attend to
<Icydragon> YOUR TEARING ME APART DARI!
<prince-dari> Eeyup.
<SirSprinkles> There he is.
<Hipster_Brony> anyway
<Icydragon> I did not hit you D,:
<Hipster_Brony> lets talk about these interviews
<TurniBrony> Well fine. I'll just wallow in my loneliness then.
<TurniBrony> Jerks. :P
<Ghosties> The password was changed >_<
<Ghosties> but anyways
<Rurikredwolf> 4Who what?
<SirSprinkles> ...when did it change? Oo
<prince-dari> The Room.
<drfsupercenter> 03guys
<Ghosties> 4For a few days it was Sgt. Lag
<prince-dari> A challenger appears: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9KyBdPeKHg&feature=related
<SirSprinkles> 6Neener. Neener. Neener.
<drfsupercenter> 03what nature should I get for my Dream World Espeon'
<Barry> what's "the room"?
<Ghosties> 4That's how I got in and people were using it
<Ghosties> 4I guess it was changed back
<Angel_Espeon> 13Modest or timid
<SirSprinkles> It did. I don't recall that. XD
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<TurniBrony> >Implying that video isn't just as tired as The Room.
<Icydragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNv-tH0Vmik
<prince-dari> For some reason this network doesn't keep chanserv in its channels.
<Ghosties> 4Where's Silver? Is he gonna make it?
<Hipster_Brony> 8The Room is the worst movie ever made
<Hipster_Brony> 8we watched it one week
<Hipster_Brony> he should
<Hipster_Brony> i reminded him of it on FB and he said he knew
<Quanyails> 7What part of your party is it going to be?
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03It's not
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm just collecging XZD
<drfsupercenter> 03*collecting
<Quanyails> 7Hrm.
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't do competitive battling remember
<Quanyails> 7Get the one with the highest IVs. :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I just like having rare ones be natures that suit them
<Hipster_Brony> DCD will be here around 4
<drfsupercenter> 03that doesn't really help
<Ghosties> 4Okay, anyways, mod interviews
<drfsupercenter> 03what do modest and timid do to stats?
*Quanyails 7got a Timid one which happened to have 31 Spd. IVs.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Timid is +speed -attack
<Quanyails> 7Modest: increase sp.atk, decrease atk.
<Quanyails> 7And that.
<Angel_Espeon> 13modest is +sp attack -attack
<Hipster_Brony> yes, we need to come up with questions, first of all
<drfsupercenter> 03so why would you want -attack for Espeon, because most of its attacks are sp.atk?
<SirSprinkles> 6"DO YOU EAT"
<Hipster_Brony> and then talk about how we are going to conduct them so it isnt a jumbled mess of 3 of us asking the same person 3 different questions at the same time
<Quanyails> 7And because its attack stat is low.
<Visimar> It's because its Attack stat is pretty low.
<Quanyails> 7So it's unnecessary to boost it.
<Ghosties> 4How available will you be?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<prince-dari> Lol Sprinkles.
<drfsupercenter> 03well let's just see what I get
<drfsupercenter> 03this may take up to what, like 15 tries/
<SirSprinkles> 6How many BMNs have you attended?
<Hipster_Brony> ok, im putting these in a text file
<Visimar> Though if you want to mess around, make it a physical attacker. :P
<Quanyails> 7 2/25%
<TurniBrony> Batman Forever is still worse.
<SirSprinkles> 6For purposes of knowing how it runs.
<Quanyails> 7Lol, Visimar.
<Ghosties> 4How professional are you?
<SirSprinkles> 6i.e. turbochat, etc
<Hipster_Brony> lol, how do you think people will answer that?
<Hipster_Brony> we have to find that out in a more indirect way
<prince-dari> Why do you want to be a moderator? (is the classic question)
<Cynder7> 6Wtf o.o
<Hipster_Brony> good idea
<prince-dari> Ohai doggy.
<Ghosties> 4Dari explained it for me :P
<Icydragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpfPmvG6CHI&feature=related
*Nick lolos out loud
<Nick> Im playing ET for the atari
<lightheart> O.o
<Icydragon> Full of weirdness
<lightheart> NUUUUUU
<Nick> godamn what they said about this game was true
<Barry> ah
<Nick> and for some odd reason I find it highly amusing how annoying it is
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Visimar> I was nearly tempted to give my Musharna a physical attack because it was a Brave nature and its Attack stat was pretty high actually. Pretty close to its Special Attack, and I wasn't even EV training.
<drfsupercenter> 03Naive nature
<drfsupercenter> 03*reset*
<Hipster_Brony> im trying to find a good way to ask indirectly if they are going to fly off the handle if someone posts something they dont like
<Barry> How can anything be worse than the worse movie ever made?
<Barry> worst*
<TurniBrony> Because it's the goddamn Batman Forever.
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Quanyails> 7There's Zen Headbutt. :P
<Hipster_Brony> im gonna ask !!PinkiePie if she can help us come up with questions
<Ghosties> 4You know, I think "DO YOU EAT" would be a good question to throw in. It'll give us a glimpse at how they'll respond to random moments in the chat
<SirSprinkles> 6I was being semiserious about that. XD
<Quanyails> 7I wish I could have a entry hazard lead and dual screener in one pokemon other than Forretress. D:
<Ghosties> 4Perhaps I'm just looking too deep into : /
<Cynder7> 6Ze fook. o.o
<SirSprinkles> 6But I think it would be nice if we could set up a sort of test for them...
<Visimar> Zen Headbutt's pointless if I kept it as a Munna long enough for it to learn Psychic.
<Ghosties> 4We should find out if they like FiM
<Hipster_Brony> oh, also, i think we should post some "borderline" images and ask them how they would deal with the situation
<Barry> How many people here like roller coasters, besides me?
<SirSprinkles> 6That would be... fairly important, actually.
<drfsupercenter> 03Calm nature *reset*
<drfsupercenter> 03also EW MUNNA
<drfsupercenter> 03and the rest of 5th gen
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes, agreed.
<Visimar> :|
<Icydragon> Did you get the promotion?" "Nah..." "You didn't get it... did you?"
<Ghosties> 4Sure
<Umbreon> 12wow
<Quanyails> 7Hmm.
<Umbreon> 12Visimar
<Umbreon> 12that name takes me back
<Visimar> Hm? Do I know you?
<Hipster_Brony> with those, it's REALLY important that we not lead them though
<SirSprinkles> 6I like troller coasters
<Umbreon> 12hmm do you?
<Cynder7> 6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uztj3vp-RI&feature=related
<Visimar> Oh!
<Hipster_Brony> so just post the pic and say "how would you react to this if you were a moderator?"
<Ghosties> 4Then how do you propose we reveal to them those pictures?
<Visimar> Long time no see. :3
<Ghosties> 4*shrugs*
<Hipster_Brony> 1 sec
<Ghosties> 4Sounds straightforward
<Umbreon> 12yeah hi, how's it going?
<Hipster_Brony> let me do an example
<Icydragon> Lawl, I like the spider-man one
<SirSprinkles> 6lol "No links during the stream" is correct answer
<Visimar> Eh. It's been alright for the most part.
<Umbreon> 12don't you live in indiana?
<Visimar> Not much has really changed, except for my maturity.
<Visimar> I still do, yeah.
<TurniBrony> As long as they don't go up for all eternety. I don't like heights.
<Ghosties> 4We're gonna be interviewing euro applicants, yeah?
<Umbreon> 12sweet
<Barry> that's cool.
<Umbreon> 12there might be a really awesome chance to meet up D:
<mib_r4m4ar> Wait
<Umbreon> 12pokemon tcg nationals is being held in indianapolis
<Umbreon> 12this year
<Icydragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycTz89FEa4c&feature=player_embedded
<Barry> So, Turni, you wouldn't like the hyper coasters, huh?
<mib_r4m4ar> Oh chat. You so crazy.
<Visimar> And by maturity I meant in the mental sense, not physical. I'm 23. :P
<Barry> The ones that go up several hundred feet at the start
<Umbreon> 12i'm 21
<Visimar> Well, I'm not sure I'm willing to attend. Don't like going that far, plus I'm not too interested in the TCG.
<Barry> Hi, Stolen
<Icydragon> Yes I did
<Hipster_Brony> well, not quite
<drfsupercenter> 03Brave nature *reset*
<Hipster_Brony> people can post picture links
<Umbreon> 12it's a pretty large event so you could imagine there is going to be more than just TCG there :P
<Hipster_Brony> i do it pretty frequently as a reaction image
<Umbreon> 12i think the Video Game Nationals also is held there
<Cynder7> 6xD Yeah I like that one too :P
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, as long as it's not being spammed in the stream.
<Cynder7> 6Can't see that last vid..
<Cynder7> 6xD Dari
<Icydragon> Tsk tsk
<Umbreon> 12i've been trying to drag drf along XD
<SirSprinkles> 6If they're posted every now and then, whatever.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd go if I could
<SirSprinkles> 6But when we can see 5 of them at once... that's an issue.
<Cynder7> 6JB FTW!
<Hipster_Brony> ok
<Glacymr> 12why is my connection so bad
<Glacymr> 12at least i know when i DC
<Hipster_Brony> so here would be an example
<Ghosties> 4...are these euro applicants we're interviewing?
<Barry> he's gone
<Barry> or she
<Icydragon> Justin Beiber?
<SirSprinkles> 6BYE MFW!
<Hipster_Brony> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/39928ecc6ab5e77d15f055a6d2fdf935/26744%20-%20celestia%20Dear_Princess_Celestia%20kissing%20letter%20luna%20Nightmare_Moon%20shock%20wtf.png If this picture were posted during chat and you were a moderator, what would be your reaction?
<Barry> lol
<Glacymr> 12so Visimar what brings you to these parts?
<SirSprinkles> 6*checks*
<Barry> Only an admin could do that
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, wow, it actually wasn't MFW
<drfsupercenter> 03Gentle nature *reset*
<Cynder7> 6Jack Black :3
<Hipster_Brony> yes, these are euro applicants
<SirSprinkles> 6Could do what, exactly?
<Ghosties> 4Thank you
<SirSprinkles> 6Steal an identity?
<Cynder7> 6WTF
<Barry> check identities
<Icydragon> Lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope. Anybody can.
<Visimar> Oh, just settling some past issues with a friend of mine who I'd rather not name.
<Barry> really?
<SirSprinkles> 6You just have to know how.
<Icydragon> Pass...
<Barry> ah
<SirSprinkles> 6And who the original was.
<drfsupercenter> 03is it Helios? :P
<Barry> true
<SirSprinkles> 6>>; I can't see the image.
<Visimar> I said I wouldn't name.
<Glacymr> 12well
<Visimar> And no, it isn't him.
<Barry> but I was wondering what MFW would want with Turni's identity.
<Ghosties> 4I can
<Cynder7> 6JB FTFW!
<Glacymr> 12the person must not be here since he's still here then :P
<Visimar> I got over that.
<SirSprinkles> 6It means it's blocked on my wifi.
<Icydragon> Ok
<Barry> until it turned out it wasn't him
<Barry> or her
<SirSprinkles> 6Which generally means it's from a site that allows bad images.
<Visimar> Wrong gender, Glacymr.
<Cynder7> 6^^
<Barry> them*
<Glacymr> 12blah
<Glacymr> 12the word slipped in x-x
<Icydragon> Dari: I like that..............
<SirSprinkles> 6MFW copies a lot of people, so... whatevs.
<RSpanner> 2I got to watch kill bill in english :|
<Barry> ah
*lightheart is off to bed
<Glacymr> 12we all have a bias pronoun we like to let slip in when we don't know the gender of something
<lightheart> Gnite all
<HyperMetalLugia> Night
<Glacymr> 12night
<NewDCD> I'm here guys
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<SirSprinkles> 6Mod chat
<NewDCD> also is it just me
<Visimar> Heh, understandable.
<RSpanner> 2it was awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03I got a Serious nature Espeon, that's not TOO bad since the stats aren't affected
<Hipster_Brony> 8hey dcd
<drfsupercenter> 03what do you guys think
<NewDCD> or did the chat window revert back to default?
<drfsupercenter> 03should I still keep trying for one of the others?
<SirSprinkles> 6Just refresh your page
<Hipster_Brony> 8its you, it looks normal to me
<SirSprinkles> 6It does it to me all the time
<Glacymr> 12drf it all depends on what you want to do with Espeon
<Hipster_Brony> its from ponibooru
<Visimar> Well, you said you weren't competitive, so it's up to you.
<Icydragon> There really was cake
<NewDCD> kay
<NewDCD> brb
<SirSprinkles> 6I know.
<SirSprinkles> 6I checked it.
<Glacymr> 12Espeon would make a really awesome special sweeper so i'd say....
<NewDCD> post mod chat link when I'm back
<Glacymr> 12modest or timid
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what the others said.
<Quanyails> 7Eh, neutral is neutral. You have a 1/5 chance of neutral natures.
<NewDCD> much better
<Visimar> I myself don't care much for natures, unless they lower a good stat or defenses.
<Angel_Espeon> 13But then again
<drfsupercenter> 03meh
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll softreset
<Angel_Espeon> 13My espeon in HG is neutral-natured and she's pretty damn strong
<Quanyails> 7Okay.
<SirSprinkles> 6PM'd you
<Hipster_Brony> also, going through and clicking on the pics marked as "questionable" in ponibooru was not fun
<Quanyails> 7Compared to who, AE? :P
<Visimar> Bah.
<SirSprinkles> 6I would imagine.
<Visimar> I saw "AE" and I immediately thought of Agent Elrond. :<
<Rurikredwolf> 4Eww
<Rurikredwolf> 4Kill Bill
<SirSprinkles> 6There's a reason it's blocked on my wifi.
<Rurikredwolf> 4that movie was boring
<Visimar> In fact she's the one that helped me create my new fursona. Which means I'm not a Lugia anymore.
<Angel_Espeon> 13No one in particular |D She tends to be capable of 2-hit-KOing some of the bulkier Pokemon with Psychic though
<Ghosties> 4Also, I need to tell you guys that I don't know if I'll make it this Friday. I got sick a couple days ago and I think I still have it
<Cynder7> 6._. The icy troll-rape face is on the fb chat.. ._.
<Angel_Espeon> 13and she's 1-hit-KO'd a Mewtwo before
<Angel_Espeon> 13but I dunno
<Quanyails> 7ô.o
<Angel_Espeon> 13maybe the other trainer on PBR just trained really badly
<Angel_Espeon> 13xD
<Hipster_Brony> ok
<Rurikredwolf> 4Facebook?
<drfsupercenter> 03PBR doesn't count
<Glacymr> 12o-o
<Quanyails> 7That second telling sounds difficult.
<drfsupercenter> 03that thing is a piece of junk
<SirSprinkles> 6It's cool.
<Icydragon> Lol wut?
<Glacymr> 12i can finally stop playing vietnamese crystal
<Hipster_Brony> just send me an email on friday morning or something
<NewDCD> roger
<SirSprinkles> 6There he is.
<Visimar> Speaking of OHKO, my Golurk nearly OHKOed Terrakion with a single Shadow Punch when I tried to catch it.
<Glacymr> 12and i'm going to move onto pokemon green and do the same exact thing
<Cynder7> 6Yeah
<Ghosties> 4Will do, Hip
<NewDCD> kay guys
<Angel_Espeon> 13She's half-EV trained, since I didn't even know how to EV train when I first got her in-game
<NewDCD> I got a few interview question ideas
<Visimar> Granted, it was around 8-9 levels higher at that point, but still.
<Hipster_Brony> go ahead
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL referring to Pokémon like they're people
<drfsupercenter> 03I always call mine "it"
<Hipster_Brony> im saving them in a text file
<Cynder7> 6http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/247307_230355343647678_100000196417709_1092371_2171020_n.jpg
<NewDCD> well, first of all, we should go ahead with the basics:
<Angel_Espeon> 13her main weakness is that she's incredibly easy to take down if you land a hit |D
<Visimar> And then I catch it and find out it has a Hasty nature. That explained it. >.>
<Hipster_Brony> we have these so far:
<Hipster_Brony> What is your availability for moderating? How many BMN's have you attended? Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
<NewDCD> "How much time would you have available-o ok
<NewDCD> well
<NewDCD> here goes the rest
<Angel_Espeon> 13Lol drf, you can call me silly if you want but I get really attached to some of my teams :P
<drfsupercenter> 03yes, you are silly :P
<Hipster_Brony> and we are going to show them some borderline pics and ask how they would deal with them
<NewDCD> "How long have you been in the brony fandom? Have you had any past experience with moderation? Do you have any previous IRC experience?
*Quanyails 7suddenly mentally rages.
<Icydragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMR4XBFEqLY
<Icydragon> No this one
<Quanyails> 7I'm trying to breed for Vulpixes with HP Fighting. o3o
<drfsupercenter> 03EW THAT FACE
<Quanyails> 7But you need imperfect stats for that. D:
<NewDCD> Why do you think you're the right person for the job?
<NewDCD> What talents can you bring to the table?
<Visimar> I ended up keeping it and adding it to my 17-mon team anyway. Catching it was a pain in the butt, though thankfully it did squat against my Golurk (immune to Retaliate and Sacred Sword, and resistant to Rock Slide).
<Cynder7> 6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3n0vBcW5fc&feature=related
<Angel_Espeon> 13I dunno how you can accurately tell what a Pokemon's IVs are without at least training them up about 30 levels or so first
<SirSprinkles> 6DO YOU EAT?
<NewDCD> Where are you located? What timezone?
<drfsupercenter> 03pokesav
<Kjakings> 7Jack Black is an arrogant tool. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd4s088LA8o
<Quanyails> 7Outside of hacking, that guy in the Battle Subway.
<Kjakings> 7The ironic thing is that he hasn't been "the young people" for at least ten years
<drfsupercenter> 03Quirky nature *reset*
<Hipster_Brony> oh
<Hipster_Brony> heres 1 im adding
<Visimar> ...just pick one already DRF :|
<Angel_Espeon> 13True, but I see people saying they're breeding for perfect IVs in every stat etc
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm trying for modest or timid :P
<Quanyails> 7Don't rush him, 'kay?
<Rurikredwolf> 4Kjakings, I find it funny how you calle dhim that
<Hipster_Brony> what specific ideas do you have for improving BMN
<Hipster_Brony> ?
<Cynder7> 6xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13the battle subway guy only tells you one stat that happens to be its best o-o
<Rurikredwolf> 4when you clearly act like a tool and are arrogant half the time lol
<Quanyails> 7Nope, he can state all of them if they're perfect.
<Cynder7> 6Meh..I just love JB.. ^^
<Kjakings> 7yeah but he somehow makes money off of it!
<Quanyails> 7Or if multiple ones are the highest. O_o\
<Quanyails> 7-\
<Hipster_Brony> /helping it spread?
<Quanyails> 7Speaking of, a Reshiram I got off the GTS:
<SirSprinkles> 6...not really sure if that's something we should get into right away...
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ah wow, I didn't know that o-o
<Quanyails> 7Zero IVs in EVERYTHING.
<Rurikredwolf> 4I find him funny. Sure some of his movies suck badly, but he isn't that bad
<Rurikredwolf> 4I've seen worse
<SirSprinkles> 6Don't want to open a can of worms.
<Visimar> Haha, oh wow.
<Hipster_Brony> i think we need to ask it
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03that prolly means it's hacked
<Kjakings> 7Also, how am I a tool?
<Ghosties> 4Can of worms?
<Quanyails> 7Indeed.
<drfsupercenter> 03then again
<drfsupercenter> 03Reshiram is worth about zero anyway
<Quanyails> 7But it's trading fodder.
<drfsupercenter> 03so it works
<Kjakings> 7I'm not saying he's not talented, it's just his arrogance is disproportionate
<Icydragon> Like Gulliver's travels... terrible 3d
<Visimar> Actually, you can get a rough estimate of the highest IV by looking at your Pokemon's characteristic in the summary screen.
<Hipster_Brony> these people are going to be moderators, we need to find out how they can help us get more fans
<drfsupercenter> 03you can also just use pokesav
<NewDCD> yeah
<NewDCD> plus
<drfsupercenter> 03it's not cheating if you don'/t change any
<NewDCD> it's not a negative question
<Rurikredwolf> 4I dunno. I just felt like sayin git
<Quanyails> 7I traded a Reshiram for a shiny Cresselia. Probably hacked, still, but. :P
<Kjakings> 7there was no 3D in that film
<NewDCD> it's not defaming anybody, nor being mean
<Cynder7> 6There was :P
<RSpanner> 2http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=723533&l=917a06fd0e&id=100000677805603 DONE @_@
<Visimar> I still haven't found a shiny in White :<
<Icydragon> There was in the theater I go to
<Cynder7> 6That's awesome :O
<SirSprinkles> 6While I think that ideas being brought up would be a good way of getting to know them better. What if we decide not to bring them on but we like some of the ideas they had?
<RSpanner> 2* http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/270668_219736044725654_100000677805603_723533_7917205_n.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> and if they turn it into a shitstorm, that just means they arent qualified to be one of our moderators
<Quanyails> 7Well, I have a small supply of Drought Vulpixes with perfect speed and sp.def, timid.
<drfsupercenter> 03Lax nature *reset*
<Quanyails> 7Anyone want?
<RSpanner> 2Thanks XD
<Visimar> Even after the millions of Audino I slaughtered.
<Quanyails> 7With wrong HP, of course.
<Tacowiz> Hello.
<Ghosties> 4It does sound a little underhanded, but meh
<Rurikredwolf> 4I'M STALKING YOUR FB YAHOO
<RSpanner> 2:P
<Tacowiz> I know I'm 11 minutes early, but there's no crime in that, right?
<NewDCD> We like their idea but don't make them a moderator?
<NewDCD> We give them credit and special thanks, plus some perks
<NewDCD> win-win
<prince-dari> Oh, RSpanner's Yahoo.
<Hipster_Brony> ^agree
<NewDCD> plus we'll eventually need more mods
<Rurikredwolf> 4that person who sent you an invite
<Rurikredwolf> 4it wasn't me
<Icydragon> Say what?
<NewDCD> so we'd have them at the top of the list
<Ghosties> 4Perks?
<prince-dari> Hey Tacowiz.
<NewDCD> mainly voice during BMNs
<Kjakings> 7I had a descriptive chart somewhere but I appear to have lost it
<Ghosties> 4ah
<drfsupercenter> 03ooh
<Cynder7> 6Can I add you Rurik?
<NewDCD> and other stuff we can think of
<drfsupercenter> 03Modest nature
<NewDCD> as in, not quite mods but kind of VIP
<Rurikredwolf> 4go nuts
<Tacowiz> Greetings, your majesty.
<Icydragon> Dari: Show me that sexy flash again
<RSpanner> 2Really dari? You only just guessed?
<drfsupercenter> 03Yeah, speed is its second highest stat, so I mayaswell keep this so it boost Sp.Atk, eh?
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03attack 16, defense 18, sp.atk 36, sp.def 24, speed 27
<SirSprinkles> 6I like that idea.
<Barry> Hi, Tacowiz
<Cynder7> 6Wtf Icy
<Hipster_Brony> theres still 1 thing i want to get resolved
<NewDCD> of course
<Angel_Espeon> 13Go for it :P
<NewDCD> before using said methods
<Quanyails> 7Check with the guy in Battle Subway.
<NewDCD> if we don't choose them for mod position
<Icydragon> *sexy troll dance*
<drfsupercenter> 03nah
<NewDCD> we would of course negotiate with them
<drfsupercenter> 03don't feel like it
<drfsupercenter> 03I'll save
<Hipster_Brony> we need to find out a way of gauging their professionalism without straight up asking them
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey Tacowiz

<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm personally going for a timid nature, since I'd like mine to be better at outspeeding others
<Cynder7> 6xD
<prince-dari> Which flash?
<Quanyails> 7Lemme check on serebii, then:
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm not too fussy about IVs though
<Hipster_Brony> and !!PinkiePie isnt responding to my IMs, so im assuming she went to sleep already
<Icydragon> The one where Iraped a toaster
<Cynder7> 6Added :P
<prince-dari> Oh, lol.
<Hipster_Brony> 8hi tacowiz
<Quanyails> 7Oh, DRF, HP stat?
<NewDCD> hypothetical scenario presentation?
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<Hipster_Brony> good idea
<drfsupercenter> 03it didnt'say
<SirSprinkles> 6That was what I was thinking... but it may be hard to set up.
<Quanyails> 7You should know its HP. O_o
<drfsupercenter> 03nothing HP Up can't fix.
<Quanyails> 7Whatever number it is/
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<Icydragon> Kjakings' toaster to be exact
<drfsupercenter> 03hold on
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm currently tucking in someone
<Hipster_Brony> can you work on that, i need to go find one or 2 more questionable images on ponibooru
<Quanyails> 7All right.
<Hipster_Brony> god help me
<prince-dari> See, I get greeted, you guys suck, and I am king.
<drfsupercenter> 03and then I need to leave
<prince-dari> (:
<Cynder7> 6Flash of pure epicness.. xD
<prince-dari> Haha.
<prince-dari> Good luck with that.
<drfsupercenter> 03it has 34 HP
<drfsupercenter> 03and now bbl
<Tacowiz> "Suck" is a naughty word, for it refers to a sexual act.
<Tacowiz> I am surprised at you, Dari.
<Hipster_Brony> FUCK CUPCAKES
<SirSprinkles> 6XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDd
<Quanyails> 7Average values: 14, 4, 14, 24, 4, 4.
<Hipster_Brony> but im gonna have to use an image like that for the hypothetical... sigh
<prince-dari> Surprise is good. That means I'm not some droll predictable person. :P
<Quanyails> 7Again, values are indecisive due to it being a low level.
<Barry> YAY!
<drf|away> 03I can find out its IVs later.
<drf|away> 03remind me.
<Quanyails> 7Well, you've got a generalization so far. :)
<Kjakings> 7Blame mibbit, Dari. if it actually put epic-chat back on I would be here more often
<SirSprinkles> 6You could always be like me, dari. Nopony EVER knows what I'll do next.
<SirSprinkles> 6Though it usually involves sugar.
<Visimar> AE: If I had to pick between Modest and Timid I would have chose that myself. The extra Sp. Atk is pointless if you're a few stat points slower than the opponent.
<prince-dari> This is it. XD
<Hipster_Brony> seriously, what the fuck is wrong with people?
<Visimar> Plus you have Calm Mind, so.
<Barry> For those of you who haven't seen it yet, here's Version 3 of a Pony soundboard created by Kyrospawn of Deviant Art
<Barry> http://kyrospawn.deviantart.com/art/MLP-FIM-soundboard-V3-0-213310684
<Tacowiz> My Little Pony?
<Tacowiz> What are you, 5?
<Barry> yep
<Hipster_Brony> sigh, i have 3
<Tacowiz> And a girl?
<Tacowiz> Hahahahahahahahaha!
<Icydragon> Pure win
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<Tacowiz> Guys, get a load of this!
<Quanyails> 7My Espeon's a dual screener/status bouncer. >>
<Tacowiz> Barry likes My Little Pony!
<prince-dari> It lacks Spiderman.
<Barry> isn't that why we're all here?
<Tacowiz> ..Thanks for ruining my shtick.
<Tacowiz> You will pay for this.
<Tacowiz> On Friday.
<Tacowiz> On Friday you will ALL PAY.
<Barry> oh?
<Icydragon> REMAKE IT BUT BETTA DIS TIME
<prince-dari> I'll be busy getting down on Friday though.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm the kind of person who prefers to train Pokemon to be fast and strong rather than focusing on how well they can take hits or not |D
<Tacowiz> My revenge for everyone in the brony community who has ever done me wrong starts this Friday
<Hipster_Brony> !!PinkiePie said she has no ideas :(
<prince-dari> But better is wrose.
<prince-dari> worse*
<Tacowiz> immediately after se7en.
<Ghosties> 4Well...fuck
<Tacowiz> I cannot tell you what I have planned
<Angel_Espeon> 13Because who needs defence when you're too fast and powerful for the opponent to attack in the first place? ~
<Ghosties> 4It's time to start anyways
<Tacowiz> but let's just say
<Barry> oh, joy
<Hipster_Brony> not yet
<Tacowiz> it'll have you SQUEALING for mercy.
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, I just realised I won't get to see Se7en, I'll be on holiday.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Of course I do have some bulkier Pokemon on my teams too
<Hipster_Brony> we still need a hypothetical to gauge professionalism
<Quanyails> 7Mmm....
<Icydragon> Then we'll find poochy and have a rematch
<prince-dari> So I'll stay ignorant about this apparently awesome film.
<Quanyails> 7I'd counter that.
<Tacowiz> ...But will you be there AFTER Se7en?
<prince-dari> :P
<SirSprinkles> 6That movie looks like it'll be fun to make fun of.
<Cynder7> 6He talked to me a while ago on msn..
<Tacowiz> I showed you guys WalrusGuy's review of Spider's Web, right?
<Ghosties> 4Make fun of what film
<Hipster_Brony> lemme think
<SirSprinkles> 6Spider's Web
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<Icydragon> I'm so naughty
<Tacowiz> http://naveryw.deviantart.com/journal/29716131/
<Tacowiz> I wanted to try to get all the mods to read the review before Friday. It hasn't worked.
<RSpanner> 2he tries to talk to me on dA :L
<Hipster_Brony> how about, someone insulting said mod
<Cynder7> 6:O
<SirSprinkles> 6That was what I was thinking.
<Tacowiz> Basically it's like Transmorphers, Ratatoing, and I Am Omega in the sense that it's a cheap cash-in on an already existing film
<Angel_Espeon> 13My Espeon in HG has a moveset that's based around countering her weaknesses than anything else
<Icydragon> Pedoforks never learn
<SirSprinkles> 6*throws on Internet Explorer*
<Tacowiz> but it's so freaking trippy that it becomes entertaining in its own right.
<Cynder7> 6xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Psychic, Signal Beam, Shadow Ball, Morning Sun
<Angel_Espeon> 13though tbh I never use Morning Sun anymore
<Tacowiz> When I saw it sometimes I was laughing AT the movie
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm gonna have two accounts on at once so I can attack them, sound good?
<Tacowiz> and sometimes I was laughing WITH the movie
<Angel_Espeon> 13so I should do something about that |D
<Hipster_Brony> yes, good idea
<Tacowiz> just like WalrusMan predicted.
<Tacowiz> There's a scene where the main character, Walt, robs a gas station
<Quanyails> 7Mmm'kay.
<SirSprinkles> 6Obviously not going to use SprinkleTheSecond
<Tacowiz> and so he gets chased by giant shrimp on motorcycles
<Ghosties> 4What if they catch on?
<Hipster_Brony> 8taco, this is like the 4th time you have posted it now :D
<Tacowiz> who shoot rockets out of their heads.
<Angel_Espeon> 13then again I'm not a competitive battler, I just EV train and such because I like seeing the results of my hard work :P
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll try to make sure they won't.
<Quanyails> 7Lol, I just got a modest (but Flash Fire) Vulpix. O_o
<SirSprinkles> 6And if they do, ask them to prove it.
<Tacowiz> I actually went to Toys'R'Us (they have lots of knock off movies in their cheapo movie bin) to buy it.
<Barry> That just means he likes it that much
*prince-dari will lol if they whois everyone in the channel. :P
<Tacowiz> It's the only movie that's bad AND good at the same time.
<Cynder7> 6Hey
<Hipster_Brony> wait a minute
<Hipster_Brony> dari
<Tran_Pham> 13Hi!
<Barry> It's so bad it spins right around and becomes good again
<Hipster_Brony> can you help us out with this?
<Tacowiz> It FEELS like a so bad it's good movie, but there are times when you're going "no, they obviously meant this to be funny".
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'd choose a Flash Fire Vulpix over a Drought one, mainly because I don't really use weather o3o
<prince-dari> What do you want me to do?
<Tran_Pham> 13Nice to see you again!
<Hipster_Brony> can you log in with a different name and try trolling the guy we're interviewing?
<Cynder7> 6Nice to see you too ^^
<Tacowiz> No, I mean there are a few jokes/gags/scenes so ridiculous that you can tell they were SUPPOSED to be funny.
<Cynder7> 6How are ya
<Cynder7> 6?
<Tran_Pham> 13Good.
<Steve> 12 Hello, Neon and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Quanyails> 7Lol, my Ninetales is a counter for weather teams. :P
<Icydragon> prince-dari: You like nostalgia critic?
<Hipster_Brony> cuz they cant /whois to find out then, right?
<Tran_Pham> 13I don't know.
<SilverSonic> o3o
<SirSprinkles> 6From what I've seen, most people don't know what /whois is.
<prince-dari> Some of the things he did were good.
<SirSprinkles> 6And if they do, that's the proof I'm asking that they provide.
<Neon> Kjakings... still alive despite all of the Harvesters I sent howling into hell after you.
<Tran_Pham> 13I guess so.
<Icydragon> Like the room review XD
<Hipster_Brony> ok
<Tran_Pham> 13:)
<Hipster_Brony> anyway, we need to get sorted out who is going to ask what
<Tacowiz> http://www.cracked.com/article_18516_the-6-most-psychotic-rip-offs-famous-animated-films.html Look at Number 5.
<SirSprinkles> 6Because that'll be a good measure of how much they know about IRC, aswell.
<Hipster_Brony> who is still here and at their keyboard?
<Angel_Espeon> 13The only Pokemon I've trained to use weather is my Floatzel with Rain Dance
<Icydragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM6Hx6dK8aI&NR=1
<Angel_Espeon> 13but then I discovered how bad his IVs are |D
<Hipster_Brony> really, just me and sprinkles?
<prince-dari> Lol.
<prince-dari> I didn't leave in the last 30 seconds. :P
<Hipster_Brony> and dari
<Tran_Pham> 13Squidwrak!
<Cynder7> 6GAH
<Cynder7> 6NOT THAT THUS AGAIN
<Tacowiz> "It turns out the snake's credit card doesn't work and they have to rob a gas station, which leads to a high speed pursuit by some crabs that shoot rockets."
*Quanyails 7blinks.
<Quanyails> 7Well, Floatzel under rain is the fastest pokemon of everything.
<Icydragon> Who wants to see something scary?
<Hipster_Brony> ok, dari, do you want to ask questions or just observe?
<Tran_Pham> 13Not me.
<prince-dari> I'm here for whatever you need me to do. XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13Somehow my Floatzel ended up with nearly all IVs in single-digit numbers apart from HP which is 31
<Hipster_Brony> its your choice
<Cynder7> 6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXGc2qhhi3o
<prince-dari> Fine, I'll watch, I'm a half-op anyway.
<Ghosties> 4I'm here, I feel like shit, but I'm here
<Angel_Espeon> 13but he doesn't even need the HP IVs since defence is pretty low .w.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, I'm GREAT_and_POWERFUL
<Tran_Pham> 13I never knew you know Avatar. :D
<Icydragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMS7gcHq1Bk
<Tacowiz> ...I'm probably getting annoying at this point, and if so I apologize. I'm jUst REALLY hyped to see the weird movie I bought for 5 bucks and fell in love with be shown to an audience of 300 people.
<Hipster_Brony> are you cool to ask questions, ghosties?
<Quanyails> 7Did you EV train it? O_o
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I should be
<Hipster_Brony> alright
<Tacowiz> I'm waiting for whoever's doing the interview to interview me. ..Unless this was the interview all along. In which case, I'm screwed.
<Tran_Pham> 13.......Link (The Legend of Zelda).
<Hipster_Brony> lemme split them up quick
<Icydragon> No, ben.../
<Hipster_Brony> 1 sec
<Quanyails> 7Oh, yeah; there was this glitch or somethingother in Ruby/Sapphire that caused the Lati in the game to get low IVs.
<Cynder7> 6Love Avatar.. :P I can draw Zuko too :P
<Tran_Pham> 13Oh.
<Quanyails> 7I still have 'em in White,
<Kjakings> 7damnit more new people. I don't like new people in my spyrochat
<Tran_Pham> 13Zuko rockes!
<Cynder7> 6DEPRESSING SONG OF DEPRESSMENT
<SirSprinkles> 6...I'm so tempted to begin trolling right now, after what Taco just said
<Cynder7> 6Zuko ftw!
<Angel_Espeon> 13Sorry, went afk for a minute |D
<Cynder7> 6He's really fun to draw too..
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I wanted to fuck with him as well
<Kjakings> 7Zuko is a whiny man child who seriously needs to get laid.
<Quanyails> 7That's all right.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah I EV trained my Floatzel in Attack and Speed, but I didn't check the IV spread until he was lv 50
<prince-dari> I wonder who that reminds me of...
<Tran_Pham> 13What about in the movie (The Last Airbender)?
<Cynder7> 6It's only like 3-4 new peoples so it's not too bad :P
<Cynder7> 6Haven't seen it.. :P
<Hipster_Brony> ghosties, im gonna give you the simple ones so you can just chill out and not have to worry about follow ups and stuff
<Angel_Espeon> 13so it ended up being a bit of a wasted effort |D
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, I've got another account on. So I could do it without him knowing it's a mod, since I'm going to troll him anyway.
<Tran_Pham> 13I see.
<Cynder7> 6Aa..such kindness in Kja..
<NewDCD> HE SCREWED
<Kjakings> 7He is.
<GREAT_and_POWERFUL> Dude, do you ever shut up?
<SirSprinkles> 6BEGIN TROLLING
<Hipster_Brony> DCD, do you want to ask questions?
<Ghosties> 4I would be much appreciated, Hip. Don't mean to be a sourpuss, but I ain't in the right frame of mind to be interviewing anybody really :D
<Tran_Pham> 13Yup.
<Hipster_Brony> ok, do these:
<Quanyails> 7Base stats are still more significant, you know. :P
<Hipster_Brony> How many BMN's have you attended? Where are you located? What is your availability for moderating?
<Cynder7> 6Ok,I don't deny the fact that he gets whiny at points but anyways :P
<Tacowiz> ...Is that part of the test?
<Tran_Pham> 13I'm with you Cynder7.
<Hipster_Brony> basic stuff, shouldnt have any follow ups or in depth questions there
<Ghosties> 4HE'S ONTO YOU SPRINKS
<prince-dari> LOL OWNED
<Cynder7> 6:P
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL
<Hipster_Brony> OH SHIT
<Ghosties> 4I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN
<Ghosties> 4PANIC
<Tran_Pham> 13;)
<Tacowiz> I'm just bored and waiting for the mod interview to start while playing with the pony soundboard.
<Cynder7> 6After watching those BT videos I wanna try out Minecraft.. ._.
<Quanyails> 7Did I give you a Drought Vulpix before?
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, wait...
<prince-dari> Dat psychic skill.
<Hipster_Brony> 1 sec
<Hipster_Brony> i can defuse this
<Ghosties> 4Okay, so, are we asking in the main room? Who all is in there that we're interviewing besides Taco?
<Hipster_Brony> 8sorry, bear with us, we're just getting a few things straightened out
<Angel_Espeon> 13Nah, you haven't o3o
<Quanyails> 7Want one?

<Icydragon> Srsly, watz minecartf
<GREAT_and_POWERFUL> ...did you see that wall of text though?
<Hipster_Brony> i MAY kick you once if he seems like he's getting on to you
<SirSprinkles> 6That's fine.
<Tacowiz> I forgive you. I don't mind waiting, because I'm playing with a soundboard.
*Quanyails 7lols.
<GREAT_and_POWERFUL> And yourself.
<prince-dari> BANBANBABANBANBANBA :P
<Quanyails> 7Ah, HP Ice.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well I don't really need one, but thanks anyway :3
<Quanyails> 7All right.
<Tacowiz> Touche.
<Ghosties> 4Okay, I think you're trying a little too much
<Ghosties> 4You seem like a honest parasprite, maybe have a bit more discretion?
<Rurik> 4on laptop
*Quanyails 7blinks.
<Ghosties> 4Huh, well, perhaps this will work then
<Hipster_Brony> yeah lol
<Quanyails> 7Woooah, Outstanding potential. O_o
<Quanyails> 7THREE PERFECT STATS. :D
<Cynder7> 6http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIk_pDXKDK8 <- Minecraft by BT FTW
<Icydragon> Cool
<Hipster_Brony> also
<Angel_Espeon> 13Congrats! :3
<Hipster_Brony> dari
<Quanyails> 7It has Flash Fire. :U
<Kjakings> 7Minecraft is lego, but with zombies
<Hipster_Brony> can you do these: Why do you want to be a BMN moderator? Do you have any previous IRC experience? How long have you been a brony?
<SirSprinkles> 6I wish I still had firefox and safari...
<prince-dari> Sure.
<Hipster_Brony> ok
<Ghosties> 4So where are we asking?
<Angel_Espeon> 13Flash Fire is still a pretty good ability, in my opinion :P
<Cynder7> 6I wants to build!
<Cynder7> 6brb...I seriously need to eat something.. ._.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol I can have multiple names on at once...
<Quanyails> 7Yeah, but for my team, I need a Ninetales to counter weather. :/
<SirSprinkles> 6On Internet Explorer.
<Icydragon> Sounds cool
<Hipster_Brony> sprinkles, can you ask these: Do you have any experience moderating? What talents do you bring to the table? What specific ideas do you have to improve BMN and help increase viewership?
<Tran_Pham> 13...........
<prince-dari> Lol, Sprinkles kicking himself.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<Hipster_Brony> lets open up a separate room for the interview
<Icydragon> *noms dots8
<Icydragon> *
*Quanyails 7continues breeding.
<Icydragon> **
<Hipster_Brony> since it does contain a little bit of personal info
<Ghosties> 4Alright

<Tran_Pham> 13☻
<Hipster_Brony> ill do the stuff with the images
<Hipster_Brony> now
<Cynder7> 6Cookie time..
<Hipster_Brony> ghosties, you ask your questions first
<Ghosties> 4Sure
<Hipster_Brony> then sprinkles and dari, you switch off questions
<Angel_Espeon> 13Instead of trying to get HP Ice, why not just teach it Energy Ball?
<Cynder7> 6Are ze dots tasty?
<Ghosties> 4Uh, what room will it be in?
<Icydragon> Nummy
<Cynder7> 6^^
<Hipster_Brony> and i will finish up with the pictures
<SirSprinkles> 6Just make it #BronyStateInterviews or something
<Quanyails> 7I'm trying to get HP fighting.
<Ghosties> 4Gotcha
*Cynder7 6gives Icy a cookie
<Ghosties> TEEHEE
<Tran_Pham> 13My little pony!
<Hipster_Brony> 8Tacowiz, please join #BronyStateInterviews
<Icydragon> You shouldn't have done that...
<Quanyails> 7Works wonders on Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Hydreigon.
<Ghosties> 4Alright, who other than Taco are we interviewing?
<Hipster_Brony> 8NO ONE ELSE JOIN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW
<Quanyails> 7And Heatran.
<prince-dari> Did I divide by 0?
<Quanyails> 7And I mean Excadrill carrying Air Balloons. :P
<Ghosties> 4Nevermind
<GREAT_and_POWERFUL> OR WHAT?
<Hipster_Brony> just him so far
<Cynder7> 6I like the Pony TV :P
<Ghosties> 4I read the main room
<Quanyails> 7No, wait:
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<SirSprinkles> 6Or I ban you?
<Quanyails> 7Scratch Excadrill out completely. XD
*Quanyails 7is thinking of Brick Break with Earthquake. o3o
<Tran_Pham> 13I'm just saying.
<Quanyails> 7HP Ice does cover dragons which resist fire and grass.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol Hipster
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ah right, I thought you were getting HP Fighting to counter weaknesses or something |D
<Icydragon> Ironicly they're playing it on xbox...
<Hipster_Brony> sprinkles, dont take it to the point where i would actually have to ban you
<SirSprinkles> 6Duh.
<Ghosties> 4Can I kick Sprinks at some point? I haven't gotten my fix in a couple weeks
<prince-dari> One interviewee, nice competition he has. XD
<Hipster_Brony> just making sure you knew
<Ghosties> 4Rather, Sprinks' mock identity
<SirSprinkles> 6If I get close, I'll just end up flipping out and leaving.
<Quanyails> 7Well, pokemon that resist me, similarly.
<Ghosties> 4He hasn't joined yet
<SirSprinkles> 6...way to pay attention to the chat...
<Ghosties> 4He's on a pony soundboard :P
<Ghosties> 4He's distracted
<Hipster_Brony> 8tacowiz, are you planning on interviewing or not?
<Chimera> 04I need an opinoon
<Chimera> 04http://www.megaswf.com/serve/1136342/ || http://www.megaswf.com/serve/1136341/ <-- Blue or no blur?
<prince-dari> Fair enough.
<Tran_Pham> 13♣♦♠
<Ghosties> 4Is Taco the only interviewee we have?
<Cynder7> 6CHOCOLATE COOKIE FTW
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm just saying, he didn't respond to me and Ghosties when we said hi to him when he first came on, either.
<Icydragon> Yeah... no
<SirSprinkles> 6I thought there was another.
<prince-dari> He talked to me.
<Ghosties> 4Taco didn't?
<Cynder7> 6D:
<prince-dari> People like me. :P
<Ghosties> 4I didn't even say anything to him
<SirSprinkles> 6Only responded to dari.
<Quanyails> 7No blur.
<Tran_Pham> 13Not hungry.
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, wait, it was me and Hipster. XD
<Hipster_Brony> that we know of
<Ghosties> 4Soooo
<Hipster_Brony> there might be others coming later
<Angel_Espeon> 13^
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<prince-dari> This is...Eventful.
<prince-dari> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Best. Interview. Ever.
<Hipster_Brony> if we dont like what he brings to the table, we can go another week without adding a mod
<Ghosties> 4*awkwardly fiddles with thumbs*
<Hipster_Brony> and we can put in the announcements that we are looking for a new mod
<Steve> 12 Hello, Aristeo and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Chimera> 04k
<Ghosties> 4TACOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Hipster_Brony> not a good way to start out your interview...
<Ghosties> 4HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO??????
<Ghosties> 4Well, he's not prompt
*prince-dari RD executive toy.gif
<Hipster_Brony> wat?
<Icydragon> *holds your cookies over a cliff*
<Ghosties> 4Prompt, he's not on time
<Cynder7> 6NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<prince-dari> Early for interview, then late for interview. Impressive.
<HyperMetalLugia> Hmm
<Icydragon> Give me you life...
<Ghosties> 4XD
<Tacowiz> Sorry
<Tacowiz> Here I am
<Ghosties> 4He did show up 11 minutes early
<Tacowiz> I was in another tab
<Tran_Pham> 13num-num-num-num
<GREAT_and_POWERFUL> I thought you were jacking off
<Ghosties> 4Just join the interview room please
<Tacowiz> sorry
<prince-dari> [21:24] * prince-dari RD executive toy.gif
<prince-dari> [21:24] <Hipster_Brony> wat?
<Ghosties> 4Alright
<prince-dari> Talking about this
<Cynder7> 6D:
<HyperMetalLugia> Blur :p
<Hipster_Brony> lol
<Ghosties> 4Going ahead and starting
<HyperMetalLugia> Sonic has speed blur, so why not a animation
<Ghosties> 4Beginning now
<HyperMetalLugia> *an
<Hipster_Brony> go ahead
<GREAT_and_POWERFUL> WHATEVER! I'm outta here. Bunch of jackoffs.
<Cynder7> 6I can't..What else could I give you?
<Ghosties> 4Taco, I'm gonna ask you questions first and then the other mods will follow
<Chimera> 04because this =/= Sonic?
<Tacowiz> Okay.
<HyperMetalLugia> So, it looks cool anyway :p
<Ghosties> 4Okay
<Tran_Pham> 13I'm eating Stride Gum right now.
<prince-dari> Sprinkles - B&
<Cynder7> 6ATLA started! :D
<Ghosties> 4How many BMNs have you attended?
<Icydragon> ....*tilts the plate and some fall to their death* Give me something good...
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL
<Hipster_Brony> oh dari, i was going to ask you
<Hipster_Brony> before i forget
<Cynder7> 6NOOOOOOOO!
<Cynder7> 6Like what?
<Hipster_Brony> how do you do the hostname ban?
<Tacowiz> You mean for all of or some of?
<Icydragon> Your mom
<Tran_Pham> 13Bon appetit!
<Ghosties> 4I clicked on his name and then saw the hostname ban option
<Cynder7> 6^^
<Cynder7> 6Why?
<Ghosties> 4I'm just asking how many you've attended
<Icydragon> *drops more cookies*
<Tacowiz> I was here for Mulan and Space Jam. I was here for Superman 4. I was here for Super Mario Bros.
<Hipster_Brony> no, dont do that
<Cynder7> 6TELL ME!
<Hipster_Brony> thats how i broke chat that one time
<Cynder7> 6LEAVE THE COOKIES.
<SirSprinkles> 6You would do it essentially the same way. But obviously don't.
<Tacowiz> I was here for The Room
<Tacowiz> So 4, I believe.
<Hipster_Brony> im trying to figure out how i can do an IP ban or something in case we have a persistent parasprite
<Icydragon> Convince me little one...
<SirSprinkles> 6There is a way. It's essentially the same.
<prince-dari> It's easier on mIRC because I can just have an alias and do /kb nick to hostname ban and kick.
<Ghosties> 4Where are you located, Taco?
<Tacowiz> West Virginia
<Hipster_Brony> hold up
<Hipster_Brony> ghosties, ask him why he missed the other ones
<Hipster_Brony> i want to gauge his commitment
<Ghosties> 4Why did you miss the other BMNs?
<Aristeo> Kitten, why scared?
<Hipster_Brony> ok, so im just using the regular chat client with the site
<Cynder7> 6Other than my life and my mom,what else would you accept?
<Hipster_Brony> how do i do an IP ban if we have something like that?
<Cynder7> 6Wait..
<prince-dari> You could either use the built in function as Ghosties said, or to do it manually you'd have to do this:
*Cynder7 6presents Megatron.
<Tacowiz> I remember I wanted to go to Monty Python & The Holy Grail, but I lost track of time. I think I was playing Portal 2 that night.
<prince-dari> Copy the hostname
<Tacowiz> I wasn't interested in going to Evil Dead 2 because I hadn't seen the first one.
<SirSprinkles> 6...that answer was not something very good... *cringe*
<Hipster_Brony> ooh
<prince-dari> Maybe mibbit has a built in alias for it.
<prince-dari> I'll check for you.
<Hipster_Brony> missed it because playing portal 2
<Hipster_Brony> thats an awful answer
<Icydragon> I have 6 Megtrons
<SirSprinkles> 6Absolutely horrid.
<Cynder7> 6GAH.
<Ghosties> 4Finishing up my questions
<Hipster_Brony> thanks dari
<Ghosties> 4Unless you guys want me to ask something else too
<Tran_Pham> 13Everyone need to share COOKIES!!!!
<Tran_Pham> 13You mean Megatron in Transformer.
<Icydragon> MEGATRON'S COOKIES
<Tran_Pham> 13Hope it's yummy.
<Hipster_Brony> just those 3 i gave you should be good
<Cynder7> 6ULTRATRON
<Ghosties> 4*nods*
<Tacowiz> I was late for The Room because I thought it was the second movie showing. I was REALLY upset when I arrived late, but I stayed for the remainder of the film and I really enjoyed it.
<Ghosties> 4What is your availability for moderating?
<Cynder7> 6MORE EPIC THAN ALL YOUR MEGATRONS PUT TOGETHER.
<Tran_Pham> 13Everyone! Eat MEGETRON!
<Tacowiz> During the summer, it's any time between 3:00 PM and 2:30 AM.
*Cynder7 6waves Ultratron in front of Icy's face.
<Tacowiz> EST.
<Tran_Pham> 13Yup.
<Hipster_Brony> 8What about during the fall?
<Tacowiz> I get home at 3:00 PM during the fall
<Barry> I'm still here, but I'm visiting other tabs
<Tacowiz> (that's the time I wake up during the summer XD)
<Tacowiz> and I go to sleep at about 10:30 PM.
<SirSprinkles> 6*cringe again*
<Cynder7> 6Meh..
<Hipster_Brony> 8and this is on fridays and saturdays, correct?
*Cynder7 6throws Ultratron from the cliff cause she just finished her cookies.
<Hipster_Brony> im pretty sure im gonna say no on tacowiz, but lets see where it goes
<Tacowiz> On Saturdays during the fall, I get up around noon and probably go to sleep around 1:00 AM.
<RSpanner> 2deathbatx is arriving shortly!
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm already thinking about saying no... but we'll see. It's only the beginning.
<Hipster_Brony> 8so, to make sure i have this straight
<Tran_Pham> 13Are you going to eat Ultratron?
<Ghosties> 4I'm neutral at the moment
<Tacowiz> I have no life. Yes.
<Tacowiz> :-P
<prince-dari> Wow, we need to get Stormy, Mikey, Lambda, and Neon on here.
<Hipster_Brony> 8on friday you are available from 3 PM-10:30 PM
<Tacowiz> During the fall, yes.
<Hipster_Brony> 8and on saturday you are available from noon-1 AM?
<Tacowiz> Yes.
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<Tacowiz> I'm now assuming this position wouldn't take effect until the fall.
<SirSprinkles> 6And during the summer it's 3 PM - 2:30 AM both days?
<Tacowiz> Yes.
<Hipster_Brony> dari or sprinkles, which one of you wants to go 1st
<SirSprinkles> 6I will.
<Cynder7> 6Haii!
<SirSprinkles> 6Do you have any experience moderating?
<prince-dari> Ahoy capn'.
<Cynder7> 6Ultratron has been dropped from a cliff.. ^^
<RSpanner> 2:D
<Tacowiz> No.
<SirSprinkles> 6He's bombing SO HARD

<Deathbat> Evening
<Hipster_Brony> yeah

<Ghosties> 4God, my head's pounding
<Icydragon> Am I normal?
<Hipster_Brony> also, should I try putting up a thread on /chat/ or /oat/ to get more people in here?
<Tacowiz> I'm a fast reader and can generally keep up with a speedy chatroom.
<Tran_Pham> 13Yes, you're normal.
<Deathbat> Nothing has changed with Icy then
<Tacowiz> I'm also a fast typer. I can spell well, but I don't always choose to proofread.
<Cynder7> 6I don't want stinkin' Megatron cookie!
<SirSprinkles> 6We should definitely try getting something in the Daily /oat/
<Cynder7> 6*cookies
<Icydragon> No, now I'm a furry, bi, and a little more mature
<Ghosties> 4I'm better at the moment, I went up to get a glass of water and my head was aching with every step
<Hipster_Brony> thats good ghosties
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm going to do a followup
<RSpanner> 2Oh dear god
*Cynder7 6throws the Megatron cookies off the cliff in front of Icy.
<prince-dari> Icy is still 100% troll.
<Icydragon> NO!!!
<Cynder7> 6xD
<Hipster_Brony> also, sprinkles, ill talk to silver about it next time i see him
<Tran_Pham> 13That's a waste of cookies.
<SirSprinkles> 6To gauge your speed, could you type out a long sentence for me?
<SirSprinkles> 6k
<Tacowiz> This is the song that never ends
<Tacowiz> oh it will never end my friends
<Tacowiz> no seriously it will never end
<Cynder7> 6It's Icy's fault/
<Cynder7> 6*.
<Tacowiz> i guarantee you it will never end
<Tacowiz> i swear to god this song will never end
<Tran_Pham> 13How?
<Icydragon> *does gay troll strip*
<Tacowiz> i dont know the lyrics to the original song so im making crap up
<Tacowiz> lalalalalala
<Tacowiz> this sentence will never end
<Tacowiz> actually this is more than one sentence
<SirSprinkles> 6Oka
<Tacowiz> im just choosing not to use periods
<SirSprinkles> 6*Okay
<Cynder7> 6GOD NO.
<Hipster_Brony> his typing speed is decent
<Deathbat> cynder7: we all hail Johnny Christ
<Cynder7> 6^^
<Tacowiz> I feel I could've done better than that.
<Kjakings> 7Ugh. I'm all out of habit with being in a chatroom
<SirSprinkles> 6What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
<Cynder7> 6And ze Zacky?
<Tran_Pham> 13♪
<SirSprinkles> 6It is.
<Kjakings> 7sorry Neon. out of habit of being in a chatroom. don't check enough
<SirSprinkles> 6But I wanted to see WHAT he would type aswell...
<Hipster_Brony> true
<Cynder7> 6Do you like waffles?
<Icydragon> No
<SirSprinkles> 6And a series of short lines was not what I was looking for.
<Cynder7> 6Yeah we like waffles!
<Tacowiz> I think 300 viewers per showing is enough.
<Cynder7> 6Do you like pancakes?
<Tran_Pham> 13Me too.
<Icydragon> No
<Cynder7> 6Yeah we like pancakes!
<Deathbat> Not particularly
<SirSprinkles> 6*CRINGE*
<Tran_Pham> 13Yes.
<Tacowiz> Though I haven't attended the European showings, so those may have less viewers.
<Cynder7> 6Do you like french toast?
<Hipster_Brony> OH MY GOD BAD ANSWER
<Kjakings> 7YEAH WE LIKE FRENCH TOAST
<Cynder7> 6Yeah we like french toast!

<prince-dari> Do you want to improve BMN? Nope, not really.
<Icydragon> I like pie
<SirSprinkles> 6I think I just died inside.
<Ghosties> 4Well, it does appear to be a modest answer
<Cynder7> 6Me neither :P
<Hipster_Brony> wow, this is about the worst this interview could possibly have gone
<Cynder7> 6PIZZA FTW
<Kjakings> 7WAFFLES, belgium or potato WAFFLES
<SirSprinkles> 6dari, your turn
<Cynder7> 6WAFFLEEEEEEEEEEES

<SirSprinkles> 6Agreed, Hipster
<Icydragon> Tran_Pham is a spy
<Cynder7> 6God,I haven't had waffles and pancakes for years.. ._.
<Tran_Pham> 13How am I a spy?
<Cynder7> 6You haz no proof.
<Neon> Sorry what?
<Cynder7> 6Please,pl0x,whatever.....
<Annika_suicune> hiya
<Icydragon> *slaps Tran_Pham* Where's Mr.Krabs!?!?
<Tacowiz> I'm pretty much wasting all my time. I sleep in, wake up, each junk food, browse Ponychan, stare at the walls...
<Hipster_Brony> oh
<prince-dari> Though I've got to say that I like that he's honest.
<Hipster_Brony> my
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Annika
<Quanyails> 7Meep/
<SirSprinkles> 6...because he has no life.
<Hipster_Brony> god
<Tacowiz> I figured this would be a good use of my time, and it could help raise my self-esteem.
<Aristeo> Kitten, why scared?
<Hipster_Brony> >why do you want to be a moderator?
<HyperMetalLugia> fi..finland...Ah, Touridor's GF
<prince-dari> He doesn't just lie to make himself look good.
<SirSprinkles> 6I like the honesty... but it won't get him very far on this.
<Hipster_Brony> >because im bored
<Tran_Pham> 13He die because I took his monney. Mwuhaha!
<Cynder7> 6Beneath ze tartar sauce! I saw him!
<Annika_suicune> yeah ^^;
<Annika_suicune> i have a question to you guys
<Icydragon> FIEND!
<Hipster_Brony> that is literally the worst answer i can think of
<SirSprinkles> 6I like the self esteem part... but the rest of it... *shudder*
<prince-dari> Alright.
<Quanyails> 7Mmm?

<Tran_Pham> 13Patrick.
<Hipster_Brony> sprinkles gets 10 points
<prince-dari> Yep, you're on a mibbit client.
<SirSprinkles> 6I WAS JUST JOKING.
<prince-dari> Ok.
<prince-dari> How long have you been a brony?
<Tacowiz> I'll have to get the url later so I can do this with Chatzilla.
<Hipster_Brony> ok then
<Annika_suicune> and i need to know do you need anything like "US" or "United States of America" to be written to it?
<HyperMetalLugia> Aw, how cute :3
<Tacowiz> Can I talk about my experience with chat rooms in general?
<Hipster_Brony> now
<Annika_suicune> ofc the address
<Annika_suicune> and stuff
<prince-dari> Of course, go on.
<Tacowiz> TBH I don't have much to say about IRC specifically.
<Annika_suicune> (: <4
<Cynder7> 6Plankton.
<Icydragon> I love you so mcuh
<Icydragon> *MUCH FUCK
<Annika_suicune> *<3
<Hipster_Brony> next issue is, how do we tell him he isnt getting the mod gig?
<Tacowiz> I am currently a semi-regular on the Phineas and Ferb Wiki Chatroom.
<Tacowiz> I was VERY much a regular in the early days of Yaridovich's streaming.
<Tacowiz> I was there before he discovered Synchtube.
<Tran_Pham> 13Who?
<SirSprinkles> 6As politely as possible.
<Cynder7> 6So this is the world you left behind..This is the guilt that consumes you...
<Anthony> I havnt been here in 38957392847923749237.4 and a half years..
<Tacowiz> And it wasn't so much a discovery
<Cynder7> 6Such an awesome song... :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Weeks you mean?
<Anthony> nostalgia slap incoming.
<Tacowiz> as it was making use of somepony else's recommendation.
<Anthony> nah Im that old
<Ghosties> 4I'm still neutral but majority vote rules
<Tacowiz> He was upset about the Livestream being continually removed, so I told him about Synchtube
<Anthony> I lost my foot in Internet War IV
<Tacowiz> which I knew about from a news article around the time it launched.
<SirSprinkles> 6...just how sick are you right now? Oo
<Tacowiz> He started a Synchtube room and the rest is history.
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Hipster_Brony> do we say "we decided we are going in a different direction", or "We'll let you know"?
<Ghosties> 4I have constant diarrhea, my head pounds every time I move, and I think I have an ear infection
<Tran_Pham> 13..............
<SirSprinkles> 6Neither?
<Hipster_Brony> that sucks man
<Tacowiz> I remained a regular in that room for months until eventually...I don't know. I felt the love level was declining.
<SirSprinkles> 6Ouch. That really sucks.
<Hipster_Brony> what do you suggest, sprinkles
<Hipster_Brony> ?
<Tacowiz> How long have I been a brony?
<prince-dari> Yep.
<Tacowiz> It depends. Do you mean a fan of the series, or a part of the community?
<Ghosties> 4...he sure does like to talk
<Hipster_Brony> not really a good thing for a mod
<prince-dari> Well, just for good measure, tell me both.
<Icydragon> Hey what do you guys think of this?
<Icydragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jItz-uNjoZA
<Anthony> ... I killed the chat with my presence
<Anthony> D:
<Ghosties> 4I like how dari is still questioning him even though we've made up our minds
<Tacowiz> I discovered the series on October 19th, the day it was posted about on Cartoon Brew.
<Hipster_Brony> might as well
<SilverSonic> you didnt
<SilverSonic> D;
<Tacowiz> During the entire past year I've been checking Cartoon Brew daily
<Anthony> YAY someone's alive
<Anthony> : D
<SirSprinkles> 6I honestly don't know what to say to him...
<Tran_Pham> 13I don't know,
<prince-dari> Well if I just cut him off and say, "that's enough" it's pretty obvious what we've decided. :P
<Tacowiz> so I could see every new post on the day it was posted.
<prince-dari> I'm just trying to be civil. XD
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, that would be pretty mean
<Ghosties> 4It would be pretty funny
<Tacowiz> When I saw the words "Lauren Faust", my first thoughts were "OMG she wrote one of my favorite PPG episodes".
<Tacowiz> I watched the episode
<Ghosties> 4But I have a rude sense of humor
<Tacowiz> and enjoyed it.
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Hipster_Brony> plus, im kind of curious to see how much more of a trainwreck this becomes
<SirSprinkles> 6...I can't look away.
<Tacowiz> I watched episode two the day it was uploaded to YouTube.
<Ghosties> 4OMG
<Ghosties> 4O
<Ghosties> 4M
<Ghosties> 4G
<Kjakings> 7Well, you posted me a message about an hour ago, and I did not notice because I haven't been on a chat in so long I've fallen out of my constant-paranoid-checking habits
<Tacowiz> I discovered the /co/ community in-between episodes 6 and 7.
<Cynder7> 6PEDOSPORK
<Ghosties> 4That bothers me
<Ghosties> 4I know it shouldn't, but that makes me cringe
<SirSprinkles> 6Oo What?
<Hipster_Brony> can you guys come up with a way of breaking the news to him while im showing him the pics?
<Tran_Pham> 13http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtN1YnoL46Q
<Tacowiz> I already discussed my history with the Synchtube.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm working on it.
<Annika_suicune> *wheeze*
<Neon> You /should/ be apologizing for all of the Harvesters I had to waste in an attempt to garner your attention.
<Tacowiz> I discovered Ponychan during the short-live pony ban from 4chan.
<Hipster_Brony> cool beans
<Ghosties> 4I'll help :D
<prince-dari> The position has already been filled. By Sprinkles troll nick.
<SirSprinkles> 6xD
<Hipster_Brony> bahahaha
<Cynder7> 6Wtf o.o
<Tran_Pham> 13XD
<Tacowiz> That's pretty much it.
<Deathbat> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78DBf2_9Esg
<prince-dari> Alright then, thanks.
<Hipster_Brony> should we just say, we'll let you know once we finish conducting interviews?
<SirSprinkles> 6I guess.
<Tacowiz> Is the interview over?
<Hipster_Brony> and then keep conducting interviews until we find someone?
<Ghosties> 4I wanna fire him, even though he's not technically a mod
<Hipster_Brony> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6Hipster, your turn.
<Hipster_Brony> 8not yet
<Icydragon> Hold meh
<Hipster_Brony> 8this is the last part
<Hipster_Brony> here we go
<prince-dari> I'd laugh if he said "I'm getting kind of bored of this".
<Hipster_Brony> 8im going to show you 3 pictures
<Cynder7> 6xDDD
<prince-dari> Just when you thought it couldn't get worse.
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Ghosties> 4That would be one of the very worst answers you could give
<Cynder7> 6That was random
<Tran_Pham> 13okay..........
<Ghosties> 4Or comment
<Hipster_Brony> 8i want you to tell me how you would react to them if you were a moderator and someone posted them in chat
<Icydragon> ko
<Skylands> 10HI ANTHONY
<Hipster_Brony> 8we'll go one at a time
<prince-dari> I haven't listened to this in over a day.
<prince-dari> I need my hit.
<Tacowiz> Are these pornographic?
<Ghosties> 4"What do you see in this first picture" :P
<Skylands> 10:P
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Heya Skylands and Higgs
<Ghosties> 4Huh
<Hipster_Brony> 8are you not allowed to view pornographic images?
<Ghosties> 4He kinda sucked the air out of the interview
<Hipster_Brony> facehoof
<Tran_Pham> 13............
<Skylands> 10Wb?
<Tacowiz> It's not that I'm not allowed
<Icydragon> FUCKING PONIES! >;D
<Tacowiz> it's that some pornography is disgusting.
<SirSprinkles> 6...this is... *facehoof*
<Anthony> yeah I closed out accidentally
<Tacowiz> I can handle naked pictures.
<Hipster_Brony> fail
<Cynder7> 6It's kinda addicting.. o.o
<Tacowiz> Naked pictures of children make me go "eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" and I close it.
<prince-dari> "I don't want to see your porn, describe it to me instead"
<Ghosties> 4Wow
<Icydragon> DARI DID THIS TO ME
<Ghosties> 4EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, well these are pictures that you may have to deal with if you become a moderator
<SirSprinkles> 6O. M. G. MAKE IT STOP
<Tacowiz> Videos/pictures of things I can't even describe
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles
<Ghosties> 4Bad sprinkles
<Tacowiz> I'll give an example.
<Ghosties> 4Don't do that again >:I
<Tacowiz> I saw 2 girls 1 cup once
<Tacowiz> and I wish I didn't.
*Cynder7 6high-fives Dari
<Tacowiz> I vomited in my mouth
<prince-dari> XD
<Hipster_Brony> jesus christ, this interview is so much worse than i could have imagined
<SirSprinkles> 6...did he just mention 2g1c?
*prince-dari high-fives back.
<Hipster_Brony> yes
<Ghosties> 4Okay, seriously, this is becoming a really, really bad interview
<Hipster_Brony> yes he did
<Tran_Pham> 13Bye people! It's great talking to you!
<Tacowiz> I went to the bathroom and rinsed my mouth out for a good 20 minutes.
<Ghosties> 4Now I pretty much agree with you guys
<Cynder7> 6See what you get for throwing my cookies from the cliff?
<Tacowiz> The taste literally didn't go away.
<Icydragon> You gonna get raped
<Hipster_Brony> 8are you ready to do this part of the interview?
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not even sure if he's serious at this point...
<Cynder7> 6>:3
<Cynder7> 6BAHAHA
<Ghosties> 4Lol, Hip "are you ready now?"
<Tacowiz> If it's nudes and not girls pooping in each other's mouths, sure.
<Hipster_Brony> canttelliftrollingorjustverystupid.jpg
<prince-dari> Wow.
<Ghosties> 4Just post them Hip
<Icydragon> YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG, TEH RAPE FACE WINKS
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok, you understand what i am asking you to do, correct?
<Ghosties> 4Let's get this done quickly plox
<Tacowiz> You're going to show me pictures
<Tacowiz> and I'll tell you how I will react/give discipline.
<Hipster_Brony> 8yes
<Cynder7> 6For some reason it reminds me of some basketball game I went to with my dad when I was 3,5.. O_O
<prince-dari> >In interview, talk about vomiting in mouth
<Hipster_Brony> 8here is the first one: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/b0888f66a008c11f490c79ec5656059f/26664%20-%20artist%3Aopalwhisker%20Cupcakes%20dexterous_hooves%20dress%20fanfic%20pinkie_pie.png
<Icydragon> .....
<Ghosties> 4That's not a very good drawing
<Tacowiz> I'd give them a warning.
<Tacowiz> That is, if there's a rule against it.
<Hipster_Brony> its just what i could find
<SirSprinkles> 6What's the image of? Can't see because ponibooru.
<Tacowiz> TBH I'm kind of baffled that this would be considered bad.
<Hipster_Brony> its cupcakes related
<Ghosties> 4I don't even know how to explain it
<Tacowiz> Though I actually liked Cupcakes, so what do I know?
<Ghosties> 4Pretty much that
<SirSprinkles> 6...*facehoof*
<SirSprinkles> 6>if there's a rule against it
<Hipster_Brony> pinkie holding a cleaver and saying "your number is up, dashie"
<Tacowiz> I'm not offended by the image and I just see it as playful, but if there's a rule against it, I will give a warning.
<Tacowiz> If the warning is ignored, I will kick the person.
<Ghosties> 4He has trouble staying quiet
<Tacowiz> If they come back and post it again, I'll ban them.
<SirSprinkles> 6He never stops talking. XD
<Hipster_Brony> wow, he got the answer right and still managed to fuck it up
<Tacowiz> Well, that's a little harsh.
<SirSprinkles> 6Wow, straight from warning to ban.
<Tacowiz> I'll kick them for the rest of the night.
<Hipster_Brony> no, he said kick
<Tacowiz> If they come back next week and post these images again, I'll ban them.
<Ghosties> 4Warning>kick>ban
<prince-dari> Wow, he changes his mind a lot.
<Ghosties> 4He got it right
<prince-dari> And keeps talking.
<Cynder7> 6NATURAL BORN KILLER FTW
<Hipster_Brony> 8ok
<SirSprinkles> 6He said kick for the rest of the night.
<Ghosties> 4...but he DOESN'T STOP GOING

<Cynder7> 6I just noticed that SR is here.. o.o
<Hipster_Brony> the correct answer for this one is immediate ban, btw
<SirSprinkles> 6What is this one?
<prince-dari> Lol, SR hardly ever actually comes on any more.
<Annika_suicune> *hugs and kisses* welcome back <3
<Hipster_Brony> its an implied rape of sweetie belle by trixie
<Tacowiz> While that's mildly disturbing, there is no visisble genitalia.
<SirSprinkles> 6...ew.
<Tacowiz> Kick for 10-15 minutes.
<Icydragon> He hates us
<Hipster_Brony> wrong answer
<Tacowiz> No warning, just immediate 10-15 minute kick.
<SirSprinkles> 6AND WAY WRONG.
<Anthony> ty C:
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, implying you can place a time on kicks.
<prince-dari> ^

<Icydragon> Hey dari...

<Hipster_Brony> this last one is a warning, btw
<Hipster_Brony> 8last image: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/39928ecc6ab5e77d15f055a6d2fdf935/26744%20-%20celestia%20Dear_Princess_Celestia%20kissing%20letter%20luna%20Nightmare_Moon%20shock%20wtf.png
<Ghosties> 4http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSw-2XtF44
<SirSprinkles> 6What is this one?
<Icydragon> Space
<Tacowiz> I can't read the text on the bottom of the image.
<Hipster_Brony> i was thinking more like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8hka0XK-O4
<Ghosties> 4Celestia receives a letter with a picture of Nightmare Moon and Luna kissing
<Tacowiz> It's not even sex. It's just kissing...between two characters that are the same person.
<prince-dari> Space?
<Tacowiz> I see no reason to punish anyone for this.
<Hipster_Brony> wrong
<Tacowiz> ..Is this against the rules?
<Ghosties> 4Hip's trying to steal my video idea >:I
<Ghosties> 4But it is a good video
<SirSprinkles> 6inb4 endless talking
<Tacowiz> There wouldn't be an objection if it was a male and a female kissing. Objecting to it if it's two females would be biggotry. I think images of any two genders kissing is acceptable, and that ALL imagery of sexual intercourse is unacceptable.
<Tacowiz> ...Is it bigotry or biggotry? Hmm.
<Kjakings> 7How is he drinking?
<Hipster_Brony> 8OK, that concludes the interview, just keep an eye on the Facebook page when for when we announce who our new mod(s) will be
<Anthony> so
<Anthony> like
<Anthony> I vanish first
<Aeroslash> hi Ant!
<Anthony> then..
<Anthony> I come up behind someone
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Anthony> and
<Tacowiz> Thank you for your time.
<Tacowiz> Bye!
<Anthony> bang
<Anthony> dey go down and I run away.
<prince-dari> He's just pretending to, it makes him feel better.
<Anthony> hi Aero
<Anthony> 8D
<Rurik> 4don't ask
<Hipster_Brony> but yes, the video i posted is mfw he wonders if he got the job
<Hipster_Brony> 8bye
<prince-dari> TRAINWRECK
<Aeroslash> lag o.o
<prince-dari> DEAD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
<Anthony> ... oh right this is a public chat, not msn... FFFFFFF
<prince-dari> So...Who's next? XD
<SirSprinkles> 6http://wzus1.search-results.com/r?t=a&d=apn&s=zdo&c=p&ti=1&ai=30751&l=dis&o=1928&sv=0a5c4233&ip=485c58da&cu.wz=0&u=http%3A%2F%2Fipo.totfarm.com%2Fpics%2Fpic_11995818968645.jpg
<Icydragon> I wish I was with space core
*Ghosties 4surveys the carnage, not a single fuck was given that day
<Anthony> sorry
<Anthony> mountain dew
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yes
*Angel_Espeon approves of Mountain Dew
<Ghosties> 4So, is Barry next?
<Anthony> HEY DAR.
<Hipster_Brony> no, i dont think barry is interviewing
<HyperMetalLugia> Fai
<Hipster_Brony> hes just a lurker
<prince-dari> I think he just lurks, Dari style.
<HyperMetalLugia> *Fail XD
<prince-dari> STOP GETTING INB4 ME HIPSTER! :P
<Ghosties> 4I dunno, he said he was still there just in another tab
*Anthony spins around wildly
<Ghosties> 4Should we ask if wants to be interviewed?
<Hipster_Brony> meh
<Hipster_Brony> i think he would have made it clearer if he wanted to be
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm kind of scared of future interviews after that one. Oo
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Ghosties> 4Taco...
<Hipster_Brony> nothing can be that bad
<prince-dari> You shouldn't have said that...
<SirSprinkles> 6http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2008-07-09-epicfail.jpg
<Ghosties> 4Taco's problem is that he didn't know when to stop talking
<HyperMetalLugia> Cute stuff o.o
<Hipster_Brony> and he was WAY too honest
<Ghosties> 4Yeah...
<Ghosties> 4I kinda wanted to ask him how old he was
<SirSprinkles> 6I did not need to be told about when he saw 2g1c...
<prince-dari> LOL
<Hipster_Brony> the worst one was his answer for why he wanted to become a mod
<Hipster_Brony> "because I'm bored"
<prince-dari> Oh yeah. XD
<SirSprinkles> 6lol I'm bored
<Ghosties> 4"Eh, I got nothing better to do : /"
<Hipster_Brony> the only answer worse than that would be "because i like to abuse my power"
<Ghosties> 4Again, I like the honesty but it did not serve him well
<prince-dari> I still think "improvements?" "Nahhh" was pretty bad.
<SilverSonic> does AE approve of Diet Mtn Dew O3o
*SilverSonic shot
<Espeon> 06o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> http://sebastianwolff.info/news/2011/01/tron-sheet-music/ < Random
<Skylands> 10Ew diet
<Angel_Espeon> 13Never tried it, but I probably would
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<SirSprinkles> 6That was indeed horrid.
<SilverSonic> its very good
<Nintendofreak> holy... wow this place is active XD
<SilverSonic> the reg mtn dew is ew
<Skylands> 10Tron Legacy had an awesome soundtrack :3
*SilverSonic runs
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't taste the difference between diet and normal
<Angel_Espeon> 13for any drink
<Angel_Espeon> 13o-o
<SirSprinkles> 6I loved some of the one word answers.
<Skylands> 10The movie wasn't fantastic though
<prince-dari> More active than it's been in a loooooooooong time.
<Hipster_Brony> oh my lord, that was bad too
<SirSprinkles> 6Up until they turned in to thousand word answers.
<prince-dari> Well, more people.
<prince-dari> Not really more active.
<SirSprinkles> 6"Do you have any experience moderating?" "No."
<Hipster_Brony> also, when he said he didnt like to look at gross stuff
<Hipster_Brony> THATS THE JOB!
<Cynder7> 6Moar people! ^^
<Nintendofreak> lol havn't been on here i think since like february
<Hipster_Brony> o hai silver
<Ghosties> 4AGain, I wanted to ask him how old he was
<prince-dari> You're lucky you missed the interview.
<prince-dari> :P
<Silverscreen> Hello.
<SirSprinkles> 6SILVER YOU JUST MISSED THE BIGGEST TRAINWRECK EVER
<Icydragon> I told you
<Hipster_Brony> you just missed the biggest trainwreck in job interview history
<Ghosties> 4Sup Silver
<Silverscreen> oh?
<Hipster_Brony> GET OUT OF MY HEAD SPRINKLES
<HyperMetalLugia> Yes it did :P
<Hipster_Brony> let me recap for you
<Silverscreen> What happened?
<HyperMetalLugia> The movie was decentish :x
<Skylands> 10Disney ruined it with no romance
*Skylands hides
<Hipster_Brony> when asked how many BMNs he had been to, he said 4
<Silverscreen> Not so bad.
<Hipster_Brony> when we asked why he had missed a few, he said he was playing portal 2 and forgot about it
<prince-dari> Hey.
<SirSprinkles> 6I am c/ping this into a word document so I may look at this fail forever.
<Silverscreen> Good excuse. :D
<NightSeas> 12Hello
<HyperMetalLugia> Aww, the midis are only 1 track
<HyperMetalLugia> Shame
<Ghosties> 4Yeah, I wouldn't have actually been upset about that one
<prince-dari> You ever taken part in a Brony Movie Night?
<Hipster_Brony> on to the next cringe moment
<Icydragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcYiJDGFvMo
<Hipster_Brony> >what are your ideas for expanding viewership and improving BMN?
<Skylands> 10Just like they ruined Alice in Wonderland, no love with Mad Hatter and Alice (WHEN THERE WAS CLEARLY SOMETHING THERE AT THE END)
<NightSeas> 12Nope, atleast not yet XD
<Hipster_Brony> His answer: I think 300 people is too many already
<HyperMetalLugia> Love is censored now, sadly XD
<prince-dari> You should, it's fun, though the IRC channel is a bit fast with >250 people in it.
<SirSprinkles> 6<SirSprinkles>: What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership? <Tacowiz>: I think 300 viewers per showing is enough.
<Skylands> 10Yep
<SirSprinkles> 6I died.
<Skylands> 10Yet you can watch Sleeping Beauty
<SirSprinkles> 6<prince-dari>: Do you have any previous IRC experience? <Tacowiz>: ...This is an IRC room?
<Skylands> 10Silly cartoons
<Angel_Espeon> 13Love should not be censored, if anything the world needs more of it D:
<Skylands> 10^
<Hipster_Brony> and then came the worst part IMO
<Silverscreen> If he's referring to having them all in a room at once, I can see what he means.
<Anthony> I only liked sleeping beauty because of that dragon
<Hipster_Brony> we asked why he wanted to become a moderator
<Anthony> then I disliked it because she died
<NightSeas> 12lol, that's a lot of people XD I will sometime
<Anthony> I dont care if she was evil
<Anthony> D<
<Silverscreen> We had the same critique come from someone else.
<Hipster_Brony> his answer "because im bored and i have nothing better to do"
<Skylands> 10Maleficent?
<Anthony> yes
<Anthony> : D
<Hipster_Brony> and then we got to the questionable pictures part
<SirSprinkles> 6And the images part... *shudder*
<SirSprinkles> 6GET OUT OF MY HEAD
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<prince-dari> You two are a married couple or what?
<Silverscreen> lol
<Hipster_Brony> i was showing him pics and asking him how he would respond as a moderator
<DSD> 10so bored
<Skylands> 10[17:19] <Anthony> I dont care if she was evil <- Evil never wins
<Hipster_Brony> he basically said "i dont like looking at gross images"
<Skylands> 10Proven fact
<Anthony> lies
<Anthony> D:'
<HyperMetalLugia> Evil usually wins
<Anthony> they have SHORT victories
<Icydragon> ":3 teeeeee boo *flips hand all gay like*" My friends reaction to trollface... what the hell?
<HyperMetalLugia> When the hero is a failure :p
<Hipster_Brony> and proceeded to tell a story about how he puked while watching 2 girls 1 cup
<Silverscreen> interesting.
<HyperMetalLugia> Like in Megamind
<Skylands> 10Fine, 'short' victories
*HyperMetalLugia hides
<prince-dari> Sometimes evil wins in horror films.
<Silverscreen> >.o never seen it, never will.
<Hipster_Brony> then
<Hipster_Brony> i actually showed him the images
<Hipster_Brony> ill post this one so you can see what i mean
<Hipster_Brony> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/9bb1e06e5055352e074ea08c043bdbcc/26603%20-%20artist%3AEchidnaJoe%20implied_rape%20lesbian%20Mrs_Sparkle%20Trixie%20twilight_sparkle.png
<Silverscreen> hmm...
<Hipster_Brony> his response was: this is mildly disturbing, i would kick them
<Ghosties> 4Wait, that's not Sweetie Belle
<Ghosties> 4That's Twilight's mom
<Silverscreen> That's a bit saucy and on the edge...I'd consider a warning for that.
<Hipster_Brony> oh shit, youre right
<Hipster_Brony> heh, no
<Silverscreen> yeah, it is.
<Hipster_Brony> thats an instaban
<Silverscreen> Really?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yep.
<Hipster_Brony> implied rape and rule 34
<Ghosties> Fuck me
<Silverscreen> Ah, I see now.
<Ghosties> 4What were you guys saying?
<Silverscreen> No thanks, Ghosties.
<SirSprinkles> 6Show him the one that's just a warning.
<Hipster_Brony> lol
<Ghosties> 4I went to check the rules and it didn't new tab like I thought it would
<Hipster_Brony> the cupcakes one or the other?
<SirSprinkles> 6The other.
<Hipster_Brony> oh yeah
<Hipster_Brony> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/39928ecc6ab5e77d15f055a6d2fdf935/26744%20-%20celestia%20Dear_Princess_Celestia%20kissing%20letter%20luna%20Nightmare_Moon%20shock%20wtf.png
<Ghosties> 4The Trixie, Twi's mom
<Hipster_Brony> this pic
<prince-dari> Lol, Sprinkles is still banned.
<Ghosties> 4And yeah, it's in the rules
<Hipster_Brony> we would warn for this pic
<Ghosties> 4So it would be grounds for instapermaban
<Deathbat> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bjGVqrDfEs&feature=related
<SirSprinkles> 6Since it's controversial, I assume? I can't see the image.
<Silverscreen> Warning sounds good. It's borderline 34.
<Hipster_Brony> he said he wouldnt do anything
<Silverscreen> Sprinkles: It's the one of Luna and NMM making out.
<Ghosties> 4Well, how offensive is the Trixie/Twi's mom image?
<Hipster_Brony> and then went on a rant about how people dont like it because its 2 females
<Hipster_Brony> and that it would be diff if it were a man and woman
<Hipster_Brony> can you not see it?
<SirSprinkles> 6His Cupcakes rant was pretty good.
<Icydragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08HFhP_C6d8
<Silverscreen> nah, I'd warn if it was big mac.
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't see because my wifi blocks ponibooru.
<Hipster_Brony> oh yeah, i posted a cupcakes related pic
<Silverscreen> Cupcakes gets a warning just for mentioning on here, right?
<Hipster_Brony> he responded by talking about how much he enjoyed Cupcakes
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah.
<Ghosties> 4I'll be totally honest, I almost lol'd when his very first response to the Luna/Nightmare Moon pic was "I can read the text at the bottom"
<Hipster_Brony> yup
<Hipster_Brony> i lol'd IRL
<SirSprinkles> 6As did I.
<Silverscreen> Is that really what he said? XD
<Ghosties> 4Yes
<Ghosties> 4That's exactly what he said
<Ghosties> 4Because I then tried it too
<SirSprinkles> 6<Tacowiz>: I can't read the text on the bottom of the image.
<Hipster_Brony> because the text is clearly whats important there XD
<Silverscreen> Wait, this was Tacowiz?
<Chimera> 04[17:17:22] <Skylands> 10Just like they ruined Alice in Wonderland, no love with Mad Hatter and Alice (WHEN THERE WAS CLEARLY SOMETHING THERE AT THE END)4 <-- XD
<Hipster_Brony> yes
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Chimera> 04[17:18:19] <Angel_Espeon> 13Love should not be censored, if anything the world needs more of it D:4 <-- yes :c
<Silverscreen> huh
<Chimera> 04and fff late because of shower
<HyperMetalLugia> Love is great :3
<HyperMetalLugia> Aww
<Chimera> 04durr
<Hipster_Brony> also, idk if you guys saw
<Hipster_Brony> but on the FB page when we originally posted the announcement about looking for mods, he said he wanted to be a mod so he could ban people who posted portal 2 spoilers
<prince-dari> Death shouldn't be censored, it's a part of life. :P
<SirSprinkles> 6*facehoof*
<Silverscreen> Really? -.-
<NightSeas> 12derp
<Icydragon> Wow, you guys are worse than me
<Ghosties> 4I seriously want to know how old Tacowiz is, he sounds like a 14 year old
<prince-dari> Judgement based on age.
<Chimera> 04http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-PArgnvqQ4

<Ghosties> 4Well
<Anthony> merc a derp
<Hipster_Brony> Aryeh Zucker I'd be willing to do mod duty, but I don't think you'd trust me. TBH I'd just like an excuse to kick people who post Portal 2 spoilers. :-P I hate it when they do that. No, not ban. Just kick. Because there should be a rule against spoiling stuff.
<Skylands> 10Karpkarpkarp
<Ghosties> 4NONE of us thought you were only 15, dari
<Hipster_Brony> from the FB page
<Ghosties> 4But I apologize for that either way
<Silverscreen> Well, so far I'd say he's a no, merely because I don't think he has the right attitude to be a mod. He's fun to have in the chat, but I don't think he's Mod materia.
<Silverscreen> material*
<Ghosties> 4It's a no all around
<Hipster_Brony> yeah, hes a definite no
<Rurik> 4http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/memes-swimming-issues.jpg
<Chimera> 04:3
<Ghosties> 4Sprinks and Hip said no while I was still neutral, until near the end when I realized he was definitely not right for the job
<Chimera> 04Also Majikarp sweeps have been better |D
<Ghosties> 4Don't know how dari feels, though
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Hipster_Brony> i think i can guess...
<Silverscreen> Is Barry here for an interview or is he lurking?
<Cynder7> 6Wtf Icy o.o
<Hipster_Brony> lurking
<Skylands> 10That Lugia animated sprite is horrible
<prince-dari> Heheh, I wouldn't like to be the one to tell him, but I'd say no.
*Silverscreen prods Barry with a stick.
<Skylands> 10Nintendo got lazy with animations
<Ghosties> 4I'd tell him
<Ghosties> 4with a video
<Barry> Sorry, it's just really hot in my house because my air conditioner broke
<HyperMetalLugia> Very :|
<Ghosties> 4That really sucks
<Silverscreen> 11HE'S ALIVE! *hides*
<Ghosties> 4God, I know that feeling
<Silverscreen> We could just put a list of accepted mods on BMN
<Hipster_Brony> still think it should be this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8hka0XK-O4
<Silverscreen> If they're name isn't on there, they didn't make it.
<Hipster_Brony> thats what i told him
<Barry> Silverscreen: that was so funny, I forgot to laugh.
<Ghosties> 4My question is when will the screening process end?
<Icydragon> Yes dear?
<Ghosties> 4As far as I'm aware, Taco's the first guy we interviewed
<Barry> jk, you actually made me laugh
<Hipster_Brony> whenever we get a mod or 2
<Silverscreen> 11My dumbass roomates keep lowering the thermostat to 60. -.-
<Ghosties> 4But we actually haven't found anyone yet, correct?
<Hipster_Brony> nope
<Barry> better than here, where it's around 80, maybe 81
<Ghosties> 4Right
<Ghosties> 4Well, that first interview was not the best way to begin our screening for mods
<Hipster_Brony> next time !!PinkiePie is online, i'll ask her if we can put a thread up in /oat/
<Silverscreen> 11The problem is that we can't have the AC below 65, because it actually FREEZES it.
<Ghosties> 4That could be potentially disasterous
<Barry> ah
<Silverscreen> It'll get more responses then.
<Ghosties> 4We'd have a shitload of people asking to be mods and we'd get flooded I'd bet
<Hipster_Brony> better than having 0
<Barry> those dumbass polarbears
<Chimera> 04well they had to make animations for EVERY SINGLE ONE
<Chimera> 04give them a break |D
<Silverscreen> only those who are serious would stay behind though.
<Silverscreen> 11lol
<Barry> I'm fine with the thermostat set at 70
<Chimera> 04We were lucky that most of Gen 5's animations were interesting.
*Hipster_Brony 8sets his thermostat to 60
<Barry> unfortunately, I can't even have that
<Skylands> 10It's not that much of a challenge </obviousarcasm>
<Silverscreen> 11As long as it's below 80 in my room, I don't give a damn.
<Ghosties> 4Eh, maybe. In any case, what do we do now?
<Hipster_Brony> lurk for a little
<Hipster_Brony> see if anyone else shows up
<Barry> so it's not the fact that they set the thermostat to 60 that bugs you, it's the fact that the act freezes the A/C?
<Hipster_Brony> we told them between 4-7 EST, so we have to be here
*Quanyails 7D:s
<Silverscreen> with that then, I go to make the next News Report.
<Hipster_Brony> oh
*HyperMetalLugia 
<Hipster_Brony> silver
<Silverscreen> 11eeeeyup
<Hipster_Brony> are you talking about the daily /oat/?
<Barry> ok
<Quanyails> 7The Vulpix that would've been perfect for my team is except for its ability. D:
<Cynder7> 6Holy crap..
<Quanyails> 7It has HP Ice 69, really.
<Silverscreen> /si/
<Chimera> 04They probably did all of Gen 5's animations, then 3 months before release the Nintendo CEO says "Alright, everyone finished with the animations for all the Pokémon in the national dex?" Then the animators go "NATIONAL Dex?!?! O_O;;;"
<NightSeas> 12bbl
<Hipster_Brony> can you put a thing in there about us looking for new mods?
<Silverscreen> 11And we were even told about it when we move in. Hell, there's fliers in the building about it.
<Silverscreen> Already wrote that up.
<Hipster_Brony> then we dont even have to put up an /oat/ thread
<Ghosties> 4Fantastic
<prince-dari> Stick ponies over the fliers.
<Icydragon> Not sleepin tonight eh?
<prince-dari> Do it.
*Ghosties 4goes off to get more water
<Barry> right, but we already established that your roommates were dumbasses
*SilverSonic 
<Skylands> 10Ayup
<SilverSonic> o.o
<Silverscreen> 11Yep.
<Hipster_Brony> absolute LAST resort is going to be asking Sethisto if he can post it in EQD
<Barry> do they even like ponies?
<Hipster_Brony> because we will get a SHITLOAD of people if we do that
*Quanyails 7stops breeding Vulpixes for now. >>
<Silverscreen> 11Holy shit. I have over 50 emails from [bronies]
<Cynder7> 6My friend's coming over soon..
<Quanyails> 7So, how's everyone else?
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8gotta set it so it doesnt email you
<SilverSonic> fine
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah.
*Cynder7 6is still surprised..
<SilverSonic> just messing with Mario Hoops 3-on-3 midi
<SilverSonic> XD
<Barry> is that to me, or to Hipster
<Icydragon> ....Pick up the soap
<Barry> Silverscreen?
<Cynder7> 6o.o
<Silverscreen> 11It was to hipster.
<Cynder7> 6I htg I guess..
<Barry> K
<Silverscreen> 11I don't know if they like ponies or not.
<Barry> ah
<Icydragon> Nooooooo
<Cynder7> 6Sry..this is serious and shit.. >.<
<Silverscreen> I just thought of something.
<Silverscreen> Rule on Sweetie Derelle?
<prince-dari> Haven't slept for 29 hours, I am becoming a pony.
<Cynder7> 6O_O
<Icydragon> Aww ok
<Icydragon> Fuuuuu
<Silverscreen> I know none of us want it spammed to hell and back in chat.
<Cynder7> 6I'll see you tomorrow I guess..
<prince-dari> Bye.
<Icydragon> Later
<Cynder7> 6See ya
<SirSprinkles> 6That qualifies as spamming, so we technically already have a rule for it.
<Icydragon> Don't be sad
<Icydragon> K?
<Ghosties> 4My baby
<Ghosties> 4Kinda
<Cynder7> 6Not sad..Just trying to get the piece of new to sink in.. >,
<Cynder7> 6*>.<
<Cynder7> 6Bai.. >.<
<Hipster_Brony> 1 warning on sweetie derelle, then ban, same as other spam
<Icydragon> Ooook
<prince-dari> MLP isn't even a meme. Still about to be top meme on knowyourmeme. Lulz.
<drfsupercenter> 03yay, my Alpocalypse CD came in
<Silverscreen> MLP has so many memes around it, though, so it might as well be.
<HyperMetalLugia> Planning to blast your state away :P
<Hipster_Brony> we have a wiki just for MLP memes :D
<Hipster_Brony> scratch that
<Silverscreen> XD
<Ghosties> 4For that matter, I think water should be a meme because everyone drinks it. Water is sooooo mainstream
<Hipster_Brony> just for PONYCHAN memes
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03nah, just gonna rip it first
<drfsupercenter> 03this has some crappy packaging so once I rip the CD I won't touch it again LOL
<Ghosties> 4Silver, did you already delete the inbox mail from the 50 bronies?
<Hipster_Brony> D: <---mfw i have to keep ponibooru open in case we get more mod applicants
<Ghosties> 4Does MLP gore/porn really bother you that much, Hip?
<Silverscreen> yeah, but I can restore it. Why?
<Hipster_Brony> yes
<Hipster_Brony> and more so
<Hipster_Brony> especially the gore
<Ghosties> 4@Silver: I need you to manage my email then >_<
<TurniBrony> And the crowd goes wild again
<Ghosties> 4You wouldn't believe how much mail I have in my inbox
<Hipster_Brony> 8hi turnibrony
<prince-dari> Lol.
<Silverscreen> Oh Celestia.
<Barry> Hi, Turni
<Silverscreen> Is he here for the interview?
<Ghosties> 4TURNIBRONY HAS ENTERED CHAT, SET LASERS TO KILL
<Ghosties> 4WARNING, WARNING. TURNIBRONY IS IN THE AREA
<TurniBrony> Set phasers to FUN.
<Barry> Do not attempt to move or we'll be shooting ourselves
<Hipster_Brony> doubt it
<Silverscreen> 11MOTION DECTING TURRENTS ACTIVATED
<Silverscreen> 11DETECTING*
<SirSprinkles> 6I vote NO. Just out of general principle. *nods*
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03not sure where my NDS adaptor wound up
<Ghosties> 4He is committed though
<drfsupercenter> 03but I kinda need it
<Ghosties> 4Gotta give him that
<Hipster_Brony> kind of
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm gonna open my save in pokesav and check IVs :P
<drfsupercenter> 03that and fix my White Forest so people don't leave, again
<Hipster_Brony> he always shows up in the threads, but hes only been to 1 or 2 BMNs
<Silverscreen> Committed to being a pain. :P jk
<HyperMetalLugia> IKR?
<HyperMetalLugia> ;P
<Ghosties> 4Even if he was kind of a detractor at first, he still showed up in our threads and is moderately in chat
<drfsupercenter> 03ah found it
<TurniBrony> So what have you guys been doing then?
<Ghosties> 4Stuff
<Hipster_Brony> i dont dislike him as much as i used to
<Barry> just chatting
<Ghosties> 4I don't either
<Silverscreen> 11Stuff.
<Hipster_Brony> im neutral towards him now
<HyperMetalLugia> Where did you put it this time?
<Silverscreen> Same here.
<Ghosties> 4Lol Silver
<Barry> Oh, I mean, yes, stuff
<Silverscreen> He's eased up on his criticizing.
<Ghosties> 4Probably because we've root out his cricisms
<TurniBrony> Sounds dodgy.
<Silverscreen> 11and more stuff.
<Silverscreen> We're just that good. *shades*
<SirSprinkles> 6And stuff before that.
<Ghosties> 4Honestly, despite being a pain he was probably the reason we looked for better alternatives to the lottery
<drfsupercenter> 03in my drawer
<Ghosties> 4See this stuff? There's some stuff behind it, and then we had it filled with more stuff
<HyperMetalLugia> Interesting
<Silverscreen> I think that's why he started attending as well. We actually listened and changed rather than being douchbags and going "our way is right".
<Ghosties> 4Pretty much
<Ghosties> 4So I do acknowledge him for helping us
<TurniBrony> Awh. You guys never do that stuff when I'm here.
<Ghosties> 4That's because you just have bad timing
<Hipster_Brony> 8what the fuck am i reading?
<Ghosties> 4Stuff
<Silverscreen> 11You just need to be around more for stuff like that.
