<Alchemist> We have a new body armour... made of melons!!!!!!!
<MahBoi777> Oranges
<Caramel> it all goes back to communication
<Acleps> It feels as if they had to do way more work just for this episode than a "normal" episode :D
<pikorar> I would eat those watermelons and instead of spitting out a black seed, I would spit out a bullet.
<Caramel> communicate
<Dken2021_> Eddmario indeed
<Luna> ^
<Airpuff> Dat magic o.o
<Caramel> if people don't respond
<MahBoi777> Kumquats

<Caramel> KEEP reminding them
<Ponies47> Magical_pablez94: I have tryed EVERYTHING! He has listened to 3 episodes Lesson Zero, Party of One, and Swarm of The Century. He has also listened to two songs Winter Wrap Up and Smile Smile Smile. Well the thing is he really wasen't paying attention and he said it count's as watching when he just LISTENED to them and wasen't paying attention. He's freakin 16 and he can act below has age alot.

<Stallion_of_War> Of course the bulls didn't break the dishes; dishes aren't me
<Caramel> we get the organization handled IMMEDIATELY
<Ghosties> 04Ideally
<Magical_pablez94> Ponies47: you made a big mistake. u should make him watch the FIRST episodes not some of them taken randomly...
<MahBoi777> Limes
<Stallion_of_War> Kari has a nice hole there

<Dken2021_> is this some kind of cruel joke?
<Alchemist> wow, a lot of ads here
<pikorar> We like this room, Om, because it's more spacious.
<Pinkies4thWall> NOT THE BEES
<Magical_pablez94> Ponies47: cause he doesn't know what he's watching at... he just knows that's a cartoon for little girls that casually likes to his brother...
<MahBoi777> Lemons
*GilDash kisses Irish_Pony.
<Eddmario> NOOO! NOT THE CANS OF-Wait, it's beer? Never mind then.
<Caramel> well, this is a committment thing essentially
<GabeMoist> that boy needs therapy
<Princess_Molestia> I am a shark, GIVE ME YOURE VIRGINS!!
<alexxm> they could have given the beer to me
<Caramel> if we want to forums to live
<Airpuff> GilDash: i wondered the same... :'(
<MahBoi777> Raisins
<Invi> GilDash it's for science. science created beer and destroys it again
<Luna> yes but with the amount of offtopic chat in there
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> PinkiePry: o hai

<Caramel> obviously, we can't make any of you use them
<pikorar> CCCP: Whatever you want it to ;)
<Tov|Christmas> I am the epitome of alone
<GilDash> Invi: That's a sin!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The forums can be used to storm things.

<Pinkies4thWall> hi PinkiePry
<PinkiePry> Gouda
<Sumica> 00,10I dont mind chat taking place in skype so long as we keep the important bits saved on the fourms
<GilDash> Invi: ... Okay, you kinda have a point there.
<Magical_pablez94> Yahooz: there's no limit to RP!
<Luna> yes please
<Pajaro> TOO MUCH DMAN ROLEPLAY
<Magical_pablez94> :D
<Randomnerd> Why the hell does anyone live in AK?
<Luna> I would vouch that
<Pajaro> *DAMN
<Thorn> what am I watching.
<PinkiePry> I've been here for hours -_-
<Shizuka> 13forums are too slow for all the communication though

<Acleps> Dat slow mo
<Princess_Molestia> roleplay is fun though.
<Dken2021_> allo AlienEd27, good
<Ghosties> 04But then the unnecessary bits are filtered out, Shizuka
<Caramel> well, as Nittany said
<pikorar> Hi AlienEd27! I love you!
*Stallion_of_War is the next level of performance
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Things can go slowly in Skype as well.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> atleast PinkiePry is normal
<Caramel> the forums are used to STORE the information
<MahBoi777> hey AlienEd27
<Luna> ^
<CCCP> we should have a RP day
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11forums are for finalized business. Skype is for discussing that business.
<Caramel> if something is discussed on skype, we store it on the forums
<Stallion_of_War> Bollocks I need caffiene
<Pajaro> all of them have sexy face
<Princess_Molestia> good idea
<Yahooz> CCCP: nope
<Airpuff> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: normal?
<Ghosties> 04Funny
<CCCP> Yahooz: :3
<Shizuka> 13which is what we had threads and such to do
<Ponies47> Magical_pablez94: True. THt's what all none bronies think. I just don't know how to make him sit down and just watch a freakin episode.
<pikorar> CCCP: I'm not RPing.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff: shhhhh
<MahBoi777> pikorar: love ALL the things
<Shizuka> 13but we haven't used them have we?
<Wrek> 05i like the philosophy better. the forums STORE info. the skype discusses it
<Ghosties> 04I made that already for the forums :D
<Ponies47> *That's

<AlienEd27> Bromance much pikorar? 6_9
<Shizuka> 13we've all had access to the forums this whole time, but like i said, they're dead or dying
<pikorar> The word "love" is getting played out, I may move to admire later, much more sensual.
<Pajaro> drug him and tie him to a chair?
<Ghosties> 04I already made a "BronyState Important Business" thing way back
<Caramel> well then, let's commit
<Luna> yep
<Caramel> right now, let's commit
<Ghosties> 04Where people would put down important info
<Caramel> check the forums regularly

<Ghosties> 04And what's the punishment if you don't check the forums regularly?
<pikorar> AlienEd27: Whatever "mance" you think it is.
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> HyperMetalLugia, you are a 14Glameow.
<Pajaro> nothing.
<Ghosties> 04That's the thing, how do you make people check the forums
<Caramel> Bronystate fails
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: Cant wait <3
<Caramel> plan and simple
<Sumica> 00,10again with the punishment
<pikorar> Bork bork bork!
<Acleps> pikorar: I like you saying "love" , don't change it :(
<Luna> no need for punishment
<Ghosties> 04Seriously though, Sumi
<Caramel> we can't run the site if people aren't committed
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03>RP day
<LordCelestia> 0,5No punishment
*Insert_cupc4ke rolls
<Luna> it's peoples OWN responsibility
<Magical_pablez94> Ponies47: tell him about the story without saying the word PONY then make him watch the first episode with you near to him, making a commentary about the quality of the cartoon and things like that :D
<Dark_Horst> hey, at least you still have your vocal chords
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03lolnope
<Ghosties> 04Why have all these things if there is no reason for people to do it?
<Luna> to be INFORMED
<GilDash> pikorar: Wark wark wark!
*AlienEd27 is socialy awkard
<Ghosties> 04Why enforce rules then?
<Ghosties> 04If you do nothing, then people will do whatever
<MahBoi777> doo dee doo
<Dark_Horst> the guys who need voice prothesises are kinda more fucked
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Except even when people are reminjded to check the forumsl, they don't
*alexxm hugs Aliened27
<MahBoi777> AlienEd27: I am too
<Ghosties> 04^
<Princess_Molestia> WORT WORT WORT! HALO FTW!!
<Ghosties> 04Exactly
<pikorar> GilDash: Ctrl-F. Quick Replace: "r" with "n". Enter.
<Shizuka> 13negative reinforcement is vastly inferior to positive reinforcement
<Ghosties> 04What would make them do something
<Alchemist> AlienEd27: think you are not alone with that here ;)
<Wrek> 05yes but i dont think there's a lack of committment val, jsut a lack of urge to use the forums
<Acleps> Do they really need to show this same Mythusters commercial again adn again?
<Ghosties> 04Saying "Please, guys, check forums" wouldn't work
*alexxm hugs AlienEd27
<Shizuka> 13you set up a situation where we resent visiting the forums just as a way of avoiding punishment
<Airpuff> AlienEd27, MahBoi777 Dont worry. Not all in here are.. at that level xD
<AlienEd27> i guess everypony is then!
<Pajaro> how the fuck do you do that
<Caramel> then what would you suggest wrek?
<alexxm> Acleps yes
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: Ill brb, Ill miss you <3
<Ghosties> 04Then, tell us, what would you suggest Shizuka
<GilDash> pikorar: It's no fun on your own. ;)
<Caramel> you agreed to the philosophy, so why not do it?
<Insert_cupc4ke> dat science
<pikorar> Myth Busted. Just like all the cherries in the world.
<Dken2021_> light beer and regular beer? lol
<Shizuka> 13pastebin, profuse use of pastebin
<Pajaro> face plant
<Ghosties> 04Ummmm
<GilDash> If they throw whisky I will be really ticked off.
<MahBoi777> Airpuff: lol ya'll are fine, I mean irl
<Shizuka> 13have everyone make or link accounts, keep things unlisted
<Ghosties> 04After what happened yesterday...
<Ghosties> 04I uh
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: I miss you eery second until you come back <3
<Pajaro> dirtnap
*Om drops da base
<Thorn> YAY DROPPING THINGS.
<Alchemist> i only seen "light" beer in the US.
*CCCP nuzzles Airpuff
<Ghosties> 04I don't feel so comfortable with pastebins anymore
<Pajaro> *bass
<Luna> Well...
<Ponies47> Magical_pablez94: I see. Get's me thinking. Good thing he doesn't know what the first episode is all about. But I'm pretty sure as soon as he see's ponies he's gonna run off. I think I might need some tape. :3
<Airpuff> MahBoi777: I guess :P
<pikorar> ... WHAT!?
<Luna> somepony made an error
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> just watched teens react to prom... LEGASP
<CCCP> the US is a funny place
<Shizuka> 13that was a case of failing to notice the privacy setting
<Ghosties> 04Yeah
*alexxm nuzzles CCCP
<pikorar> Gravity makes objects fall the same!?
<Airpuff> Hugs CCCP back :)
<Pajaro> Tory understands
<Luna> we are all humans
<Shizuka> 13which is why i say make or link accounts
<Yahooz> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: IKR
<Dken2021_> even they're ashamed they're wasting beer
<Airpuff> DO NOT DROP THAT BEER!
<Ghosties> 04But I still am incredibly wary of pastebins now ><
<Acleps> pikorar: Serious science.
*CCCP huggles alexxm :3
<Luna> and he learned from it
<Rainbowloyalty> lol Kari
<Dark_Horst> i hope that'S not american beer. it would float away with the wind
<Invi> pikorar it does
<Airpuff> WASTE!!
<Airpuff> :'(
<pikorar> Fun fact... This is a stupid myth bust because all object drop at the same rate...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Yahooz: LEGASP adams a brony
<Invi> why do they even test this?
<Ghosties> 04That's another thing though, Shizuka
<Ghosties> 04You're trading forums for pastebins
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did someone outside of our group find something?
*alexxm hugs CCCP
<Insert_cupc4ke> of course its a stupid myth
<Dken2021_> well duh
<Ghosties> 04One medium of communication for another
<CCCP> :D!!!!!!
<GilDash> pikorar: Nope. Air resistance on Earth.
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"
<Ghosties> 04What's the difference
<pikorar> But we already no this...
<Airpuff> ..........
<alexxm> Invi for shits and giggles
<Ghosties> 04How would pastebins work better?
<Airpuff> :'( waste of beer is cruel
<Shizuka> 13pastebins can be brought up from the person they are relevant to
<Yahooz> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: I wouldve bet he was a closet brony during the teens react to bronies video
<Ponies47> Poor beer :'(
<Dark_Horst> YOU COULD GET DRUNK WITH THIS!
<Pajaro> who was having trouble convincing their friend to join the herd?
<GilDash> pikorar: Okay, my argument is gone. :D
<Litwick> Y u watse cider :(
<Thorn> YAY DANGER OF GETTING HIT WITH GLASS SHARDS.
<Shizuka> 13and only when they are relevant
<Biglaw> really?
<Ghosties> 04Can't forums work the same
*Airpuff hugs Ponies47 "This is madness"
<Alchemist> GilDash: that just means they have a different terminal velocity, but they accelerate at the same rate
<Biglaw> wow
<Shizuka> 13clearly they aren't
<Invi> lol why?
<Ghosties> 04Especially if we were doing individual dept. sections
<GilDash> Alchemist: So given a long enough distance...
<Randomnerd> :O
<Ghosties> 04And you think pastebins will?
<Luna> and why is that?
<pikorar> Hah, GilDash. Finally something that I took from science class that I actually remember acurately.
<Ghosties> 04Let's face it
<Biglaw> the bass?
<Shizuka> 13believe me i'm all for actually using the forums, but the point is we. are. not.
<Ghosties> 04It's all about convenience
<Pajaro> potty
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Yahooz: probs and him yelling bronies r trolls during that was probs a cover
<Dken2021_> yea dropping stuff
<Thorn> TOILEETS
<Ghosties> 04What would make people do pastebins
<Alchemist> Gildash: one will hit the ground faster. Yes.
<GilDash> pikorar: What's the number?
<Dark_Horst> dropping toilets from cranes. FOR SCIENCE
<Luna> why are the forums not being used?
<Biglaw> DROP THE BASS!
<Ghosties> 04Where's the motivation
<Pajaro> they should drop a bass guitar
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane grabs Invi and Airpuff
<Shizuka> 13we're already doing google docs for a number of things
<Pajaro> drop dat bas
<alexxm> i have farted
<Dken2021_> Pajaro those are really expensive
<pikorar> The only class I can remember accurately is sex-ed.
<Ghosties> 04We could try for google docs
<Acleps> I'm dissapointed in the sound that the piano made when it feel... On cartoons it makes a fun piano-sound, but there it made no awesome sounds
<Shizuka> 13pastebin grants nicer urls that we're more likely to look at
<Ponies47> Hugs Airpuff 'Madness' This is NOT sparta! It's a waste of beer. :'(
<Pajaro> so
<Ghosties> 04That does seem to get more attention
<Wrek> 05i could try to use the forums more sure, but it would be more convenient for me if it was under bronystates roof rather than effing zetaboard
<MahBoi777> alexxm: heheh fart
<pikorar> GilDash, what do you mean?
<Thorn> PUT YOUR CLOTHES BACK ON!
<pikorar> Sexy...
<Om> flat
<AlienEd27> 6_9
*Invi grans Alicorn_Prince_Shane nuzzles him and slaps alexxm with him
<Dken2021_> that is kinda disturbing
<Randomnerd> Oh my gaaaaah
<Invi> *grabs
<Pajaro> sexy Tory
<Luna> it's just a link Wrek?
<Insert_cupc4ke> he sponged that like a pro
<GilDash> pikorar: G. What is the number?
<alexxm> sorry Invi
<pikorar> Put the bra back on!
<Caramel> question for the techs
<Pajaro> poot
<Luna> the forums are just meant for the staff
<Magical_pablez94> Ponies47: if he acts like that.. solution is one only: thalk with him about why u think MLP is that awesome. u dunno? just think harder something will get on ur mind. then say him to watch at least this one more..( the 1st one) then say if he likes it or not. obviously u have to show him 1st and 2nd part of it :D
<Ghosties> 04Though we talked about that one other day, finally making forums public and more convenient
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol why u slapping alexxm invi?
<Shizuka> 13Luna: for me, there's no new information there that can't be brought up in SRS to get fresh opinions
<twilight_sprinkle> wait they had to break a crap load of stuff to prove ma=mg, a=g?
<Caramel> Is it possible to make an invisible forum?
<Ghosties> 04What would be the point if nobody used them
<Caramel> or hell, how about this:
<Dken2021_> wha
<Dken2021_> thank goodness
<Invi> Alicorn_Prince_Shane he farted in the chat
<Skylands> 10Why do I keep DCing
<Pajaro> lol
<alexxm> i farted Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<Dken2021_> . . . dang it
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Yes. =_(\
<Randomnerd> Effing brilliant!
<Shizuka> 13at this time, hosting our own forums is a matter of cost and administration
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol Invi
<Caramel> can we make a tab on the main page that is only visible for us when we're logged in
<Luna> yes but Shizu dear you do agree with the amount of offtopic chat / non serious chat in SRS?
<Thorn> YAY FARTING.
<MahBoi777> YEAH Flatulence
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ATTACK Invi ATTACK
<Caramel> and that tab just links to our zetaboards?
<Acleps> Kinky...
<CCCP> ponies are kewl
<Pajaro> that's disgusting
<pikorar> GilDash: I still don't follow... I must have missed something... G as in G forces? What?
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: this show is so stupid imo..
<Shizuka> 13yes there's a lot of offtopic, which naturally arises from realtime chatting
<Shizuka> 13breaking a train of thought to take it to G is difficult
<Ghosties> 04Which is why I agree with no more finalized business in Skype
<pikorar> Um... Girls are humans, right? They pass gas, myth busted.
<Ponies47> Magical_pablez94: Anthor problem he doesn't like talking. TO BAD! :[
<Litwick> YES. GIRLS PASS GAS. MY MOTHER DOES IT EVERY FUCKING TIME.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Why not just put a link to the Zetaboards in the topic of our Skype groups/
<Shizuka> 13we're slowly getting better at it, but that's how it is
<GilDash> pikorar: G as in G. =_(\
<twilight_sprinkle> pikorar: no, g as in gravitational constant

<Caramel> topic links haven't been working
<pikorar> Oh. I have no idea. I never learned that.

<LordCelestia> 0,5Skype topic links are pretty useless
*MahBoi777 throws science at a wall
<Pajaro> facehoof

<LordCelestia> 0,5I will admi
<pikorar> Well I have yet to learn it, GilDash!
<LordCelestia> 0,5*admit
<twilight_sprinkle> MahBoi777: it sticks!
<Pajaro> dat ass
<Wrek> 05i jsut feel its handier to have everything on the same place. maybe thats why eqd is so popular, it has everythign on the same place
<Ghosties> 04What about making the forums public
*Invi uses Invi-powers to enter lurkmode
<GilDash> pikorar: Now you know. :|
<MahBoi777> twilight_sprinkle: Huzzah!
<Shizuka> 13i'll use SRS as an example since the banlist is there
<pikorar> It's as flat as her chest.
<Ghosties> 04That way we'd ALL have a reason to go to the forums more often
<CCCP> O_(\
<fluttercry> 05,15It's still there, just all the way at the end, and I have my skype window small so I don't see it
<pyrocatboy> twilight_sprinkle Who cares? Its for SCIENCE!!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Part of the reason is because some of those topic links get cut off.
*Magical_pablez94 pokes GilDash
<Acleps> pikorar: You've learned more complicated math than me, but I know more physics? That's starnge...
<Marx> CrimsonPhoenix, is she gonna do Derpy too?
<pikorar> 9.81... Okay. I'll put that on my list of numbers and call it later.
<twilight_sprinkle> pyrocatboy: this show is pseudoscience

<Ghosties> 04I say either we work to make the forums public, therein meaning that we'd all have a reason to be there every day or we come up with some other idea

<Pajaro> yay
*RainBroDash 10is being pernickety about capital letters and you can't stop him
<Shizuka> 13honestly i think part of the onus falls on admins here, in that they are present in all groups and could easily compile a pastebin of important business from time to time
<Randomnerd> It's a long long way to Ba Sing Se.
<Saturn> 08,01i've just been reading the backlog, and can i reiterate my point from earlier: forums are a *terrible* way of storing info. to store info, an ideal solution would be to make a wiki.
<MahBoi777> Pollution!

<Invi> RainBroDash ok, then i swaped g and G accidently ^^
<Luna> i'm interested in talking about it
<Yahooz> howadoin
<Pajaro> sokka gets covered in shit
<Ponies47> Magical_pablez94: Yeah he's gonna kill kill me if I do that. :$
<AlienEd27> that right there is the story of my life
<CCCP> Magical_pablez94: yay! :3
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol sokka
<GilDash> cachi01: Fussy. Padantic.
<Ghosties> 04I'm not keen on a wiki, honestly...
<Wrek> 05hmm
<Muffin0> hello everypony
<alexxm> why does sokka get no respect
<Irish_Pony> O_O
<pikorar> Acleps: Learning about the eco-system, the atmosphere, tectonics, etc.
<Luna> we need something
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: using something like dekiwiki or mediawiki, it can be done wysiwyg-ly
<RyunosukeKnT> lol
<DerpSurge> A MONSTER
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Ponies47> Noms on Muffin0
<Luna> one way or the other
<Dken2021_> easy for you katara, you're a water bender
<cachi01> GilDash: what does fussy and padantic mean xd
<Magical_pablez94> CCCP: *hugs you*feelin' better? :)
<MahBoi777> pentapus
<Wrek> 05i'd like to see how it would work before i give a definite answer, but im happy to try out
<Acleps> pikorar: Oh... We have that in biology :)
<Saturn> 08,01it'd be just as easy as posting on the wordpress
<alexxm> hey Muffin0 hows your day been
<pyrocatboy> alexxm Because he Sokka
<CCCP> Magical_pablez94: yesh :)
<Litwick> awwww
<Muffin0> baf
<Pajaro> so mcute
<twilight_sprinkle> how does he know what they are
<Airpuff> Cutest things evar! :)
<DerpSurge> :3 so cute
<Irish_Pony> Oh shit
<RyunosukeKnT> they're sucking my face!
<Muffin0> *bad
<GilDash> cachi01: Go and find a dictionery.
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: The picture is done :) http://kinzsaw.deviantart.com/art/Major-and-Shadow-3-306161679
<cachi01> GilDash: whats a dictionary? :D
<Magical_pablez94> Ponies47: it's just an example... pretend to talk to him seriously, like if he was an adult. and he will listen to u.
<Yahooz> GilDash: dictionary XD
<Herp_Derp> lol
<MahBoi777> RUN BOI
<Saturn> 08,01if you'd like to see how a wiki works for internal organisation on a real project, i can give you all a temporary read-only access account to the BUCK wiki
<Dken2021_> lol
<RyunosukeKnT> that acting
<Ghosties> 04But wouldn't the wiki be public
<Shizuka> 13thing is, wordpress is using markdown, cause it's the easiest markup format that won't wipe out the tag overrides i needed on our pages
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: no
<Airpuff> GilDash: What is that magic? 6_9
<GilDash> cachi01: Sweetie Bell or Applebloom.
<cachi01> give him the oscar already!
<Shizuka> 13i think there are three people on staff that know markdown..
<DerpSurge> So many zombie references
<alexxm> dat sewar friend
<Muffin0> alexxm: bad
<Ghosties> 04And yeah
<MahBoi777> evil hags
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: Are you trying to muder me? Because thats way to adorable....
<Ghosties> 04You'd have to train everybody to use the wiki
<cachi01> GilDash: oooh that! thx :D
<alexxm> how come Muffin0
<Ghosties> 04So
<Pajaro> dose rymes
<Wrek> 05in fact this is out of my knowledgebase, ill stay quiet.
<Ghosties> 04That's something ELSE people would have to do
<Shizuka> 13i tried training for markdown
<Ghosties> 04It's all about convenience
<Shizuka> 13no one listened
<Muffin0> my dog had a stoke and cant stand
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I personally don't see what's wrong with using the forums to share information. Although it's not used right now as often, if the topics are posted with a good name and posts added that give useful info are edited into the first post, it should all be fine.
<Saturn> 08,01not necessarily! there are ways of make it intuitive to use
<Dken2021_> azula has friends?
<cachi01> GilDash: lookslike i only have spanish dictionaries and my english dictionary is at school :l
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Train me for markdown.
<pikorar> False! Pentapocs are a case of chicken pox in which all the spots on the body are shaped as pentagons, or if you're a satinist, pentagrams.
<Saturn> 08,01like having a wysiwyg editor, as i said
<Alchemist> Muffin0 :(
<RyunosukeKnT> more like... slaves
<Princess_Molestia> Luna, how are you.
<RaveBrony> Shoot!! When did this start!?!
<Dken2021_> aren't they more of aquantences?
*alexxm hugs Muffin0 sorry to hear about that
<DerpSurge> K, not watching this, don't want to spoil myself second season :D
<RaveBrony> I didnt refresh D:
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: Oh you "Kisses cheek"
<Ghosties> 04I'm for the forum in all honesty
<RyunosukeKnT> that bumi
<GilDash> pikorar: I prefer pentacles.
<MahBoi777> pikorar: thanks, now I kno
<Magical_pablez94> Gamer_Luna: is that cute but...hem...needs to be depixeled a bit?
<Acleps> Isn't the earth partly metal?
<Ghosties> 04We already have it, we already use it (albeit barely)
<Pajaro> nah, more like people who have debts to pay to azula
<RyunosukeKnT> emo girl is emo
<cachi01> Muffin0: oh im so sorry dude :(
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: <3 *kisses back*
<pikorar> You cannot fathom the amount of fucks I do not give right now!
<Pajaro> not friends
<Shizuka> 13i'd support a wiki but i see it getting as little use as the forums
<Saturn> 08,01a forum is a really bad way of storing information, because when you want to look something up, you need to think temporaly
<Ghosties> 04Why do all the extra work to make a wiki
<Muffin0> im still hoping she gets better but it dosnt look like it
<Litwick> Aw baby!
<Ponies47> Magical_pablez94: Hmmm. Yeah he's 16. He's gotta start putting down the video games. He spends HOURS playing video games. I have this one plan to pony up his computer. Good thing I'm outta school already. He's not :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> >Pinkie's first word is "surprise".
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: it just started don worry lol
<Airpuff> You are bleak woman! xD
<GilDash> pikorar: Yes, yes I can. I worked in customer service for a year. :D
<Saturn> 08,01it's horrible from a usability standpoint
<Pajaro> until now
<Ghosties> 04Why do all the extra work to make a wiki
<CeilingKirz> forum use dropped when the ban list went to the google doc
<CrimsonPhoenix> That...blew my mind in way too many ways
<RyunosukeKnT> Hey look! It's Marvin's girlfriend!
<RaveBrony> MahBoi777: Asin, the start of the stream?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> bleak woman is bleak
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: making a wiki would take like 30 minutes of set up max, and maybe a day of info population
<Dken2021_> did he take down that boulder with a wooden stick?
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: no the start of Avatar
<CCCP> chat derped?
<pikorar> GilDash, is it true customer service people put people on hold just for fun?
<Ghosties> 04Training, Saturn
<Pajaro> no, with air
<Ghosties> 04You'd have to get people to train
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11I use googledocs for schoolwork all the time.
<twilight_sprinkle> http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e100/wanderingwhimsy/PONY/QUOPONY.jpg damnit who is that pony, no tennis player i know has facial hair like that
<alexxm> no CCCP
<FlareChaser|L4D2> Well, that game of L4D2 was...interesting.
*Airpuff hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane .. "She is scaring me.." :'(
<cachi01> Ponies47: hey if someone is playing videogames let him play videogames!!! or else ur gamer anger system will activate and bad stuff happens
<RaveBrony> MahBoi777: Oh, ok. Yay! :) ty :3
<Shizuka> 13Ghosties: then the onus needs to be on you and the admins to keep up on the training
<CCCP> alexxm: i know now
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: but there'd be no training! i just said twice it can use a wysiwyg system!
<GilDash> pikorar: No. We do it because we don't have authorisation, or because some of us are just really thick.
<Wrek> 05never used a wiki in that manner before, sounds interesting
<MahBoi777> RaveBrony: no problem:)
<Pajaro> *sigh* nothing ever happens.
<Gamer_Luna> Magical_pablez94: Yeah,I can't draw crap on MS paint :$
<Ghosties> 04I don't even know what the hell a wysiwyg system is, Saturn
<pikorar> Well GilDash, I will be your customer. Now service me.
<RaveBrony> dat music
<Iron_Edge> RaveBrony: /)
<RyunosukeKnT> uh oh, aangs in trouble
<Saturn> 08,01oh
<RyunosukeKnT> that tai lee
<Saturn> 08,01okay, maybe i should explain that
<RaveBrony> Iron_Edge: (\
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: is this live too?
<Sumica> 00,10and wtf is wysiwyg?
<Luna> what you see is what you get
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What You See Is What You Get.
<Magical_pablez94> Ponies47: REMEMBER : DON'T GIVE THIS LIKE A MUST TO HIM. IT HAVE TO BE AN HIS OWN CHOICE!
<Saturn> 08,01wysiwyg = what you see is what you get
<MahBoi777> freak!
<GilDash> pikorar: How may I help with your enquirey today?
<cachi01> cuck norris can do that with his hair!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Is this Twilight Sparkle?
<Pajaro> yay
<Ghosties> 04...that sounds incredibly vague
<Saturn> 08,01so you don't type tags or markdown, you click buttons
*Luna feels geekish :3
<pikorar> GilDash, yes I have a sexy problem I need to get worked out.
<Saturn> 08,01like a word processor
<RaveBrony> All of the flexibility O_o
<Ponies47> cachi01; Problem is he spends WAY to much time playing video games. He has never dated a girl and he's 16. I'm 14 and I've already danced with a girl :)
<Magical_pablez94> Gamer_Luna: btw is not that bad! at least i understood it was Irish_Pony :D
<FlareChaser> FUN FACT: the mods enjoy being called Sexy.
<RyunosukeKnT> fuddy duddy = funny?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14seems like something super simple
<Airpuff> I wanna date that girl! She is so ... jumpy! :)
<Saturn> 08,01it shows you the format as you type
<Pajaro> pinkie pie
<Shizuka> 13it is
<Dken2021_> and then. . .
<Saturn> 08,01yup
<SaxyPretender> 0,14just type and go?
<pikorar> Pinker Pie.
<RyunosukeKnT> pinker
<CrimsonPhoenix> Twilight what are you doing in Avatar?
<Saturn> 08,01yup
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh look avatar
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<Ponies47> Magical_pablez94: So true :)
<RyunosukeKnT> ...
<Yahooz> pikorar: GilDash isnt a Nurse silly
<Ghosties> 04So then we just say SO LONG! to forums
<SaxyPretender> 0,14works for me
<Ghosties> 04yeah
<AllisZero> We have a WYSIWYG system at the Wiki at work. Nobody knows how to format the Wiki, but aside from advanced things, it's brainless to use.
<Ghosties> 04okay
<Irish_Pony> Magical_pablez94: of course... :$
<Luna> wordpress is WYSIWG right?
<Shizuka> 13wordpress is using markdown
<pikorar> Yahooz: That's because he's a French maid.
<Invi> tai lee = impersonation of pinkie pie
<Luna> ahh
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff: x that girl
<Shizuka> 13which is close to WYSIWYG
<cachi01> Ponies47: let him lol actually 16 is a very early age to start having a serious relation
<Magical_pablez94> Gamer_Luna: of course i had to...he shown his own OC something like 20000000000000 times... :D
<Luna> well it's simple to use
<Yahooz> pikorar: he?
*Airpuff blushes Thanks Alicorn_Prince_Shane :)
<Saturn> 08,01okay, if admins/TLs want to see how we use the wiki for BUCK, pm me later
<GilDash> pikorar: Can you tell me the nature of your problem, sir?
<VioletGreySha> FlareChaser: you like your OC? ^^
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane boops Airpuff " np"
<pikorar> Yes Yahooz, he. -_-
*alexxm hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<Shizuka> 13normally wordpress would be WYSIWYG but that was incompatible with the style overrides necessary to make half the site work
<Irish_Pony> O_O
<Meanwhile> Nothing, you jelly?
<Dken2021_> dang it bumi
<MahBoi777> Bumi consulted the magic conch
<pikorar> And then he did nothing. The end.
<Lil_B> soo... King Sumi os like France?
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<cachi01> Ponies47: plus i spend all day playing videogames and i already dance with a girl also lol
<FlareChaser> VioletGreySha: love iy! <3
<Saturn> 08,01this'd be completely separate, thoguh
<Invi> Dken2021_ you'll understand
*AlienEd27 sits on the ground showing no expression
*Airpuff waves Ima be right back! Cya later Gais :P
<Pajaro> WHOA
<Sumica> 00,10kinda sorta not realy
<alexxm> bye Airpuff
<Luna> I would prefer using the forums, they are already up and running.. maybe some finetuning left and right
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane hugs alexxm
<Airpuff> Bai alexxm :$
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> bai Airpuff
<Sumica> 00,10he gave up so his people could be free
<Luna> but we do not have re-invent the wheel
<VioletGreySha> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: i made flares OC xD
<MahBoi777> bye Airpuff
<Bronysith> Sumica: whos your favorite avatar character?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Honestly, it sounds like a lot of effort ditching one system in favor of another.
<GilDash> Airpuff: See ya. ;)
<Luna> there are more pressing matters
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> omg cool VioletGreySha
*SirSilverscreen is lost in all the technobabble
<Airpuff> Yeah cya all a bit later
<pikorar> GilDash: Yes, one of my wires seem to not be working, I think it needs some stimulation.
<Airpuff> ^^
<VioletGreySha> :3
<FlareChaser> Sumica: You're sexy.
<Ponies47> cachi01: True. He's so negative he say's he's never gonna have a girlfriend. I think he got mad when he found out I danced with a girl and she was really CUTE to. :$
<Om> Airpuff: Happy tuseday
<MahBoi777> ewwwww
<Saturn> 08,01Luna: i disagree. a forum is a fundamentally unsuitable system for information storage and retrieval.
<Dken2021_> it's a plaque!
<Caramel> I just don't see how switching the medium will change people's willingness to use it
<Herp_Derp> yay!
<alexxm> Airpuff i'm not leaving i thought you were
<Sumica> 00,10Iroh and toph
<Pajaro> put one of thoe=se things on your dick
<MahBoi777> STRUT
<Meanwhile> Dat old man.
*Tov|Christmas wonder why this show didn't catch on in Japan.
<Ghosties> 04Forums would be better
<pikorar> And then they all died because penta pox is a real thing. The end.
<Ghosties> 04We're wasting resources on a wiki
<RyunosukeKnT> hes good
<SaxyPretender> 0,14quick question, Saturn, would this wiki be part of the site itself or hosted seperatly?
<GilDash> pikorar: Okay sir. Have you tried restarting your system first?
<Caramel> because now instead of not checking the forums, people just wont check the wiki
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Ghosties> 04Wasting training on a wiki
<Bronysith> Sumica: very good choices
<Shizuka> 13but ghosties
<Ghosties> 04Just use the forums
<Shizuka> 13with a forum
<Ghosties> 04Why is that so difficult
<pikorar> Yes I did GilDash.
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: resources? you mean the tech team working for a day getting it going?
<Shizuka> 13you have to think "when was X talked about"

<twilight_sprinkle> L4D time
<Shizuka> 13you're thinking in the wrong direction
<Irish_Pony> ZOMBIES!
<Acleps> zombies?
<CCCP> dey drunk
<Pinkies4thWall> ZOMBIES
<MahBoi777> OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo
<Chrysalis> thanks for the games guys
<alexxm> zombies
<Saturn> 08,01exactly ^
<RyunosukeKnT> THE PLAGUE, RUN AWAY RUN AWAY!
<cachi01> Ponies47: lol ooh so he is negative then uhmmm well just uhhmmm damn i dont know how to solve negativism lol
<Ghosties> 04We already have a system in place, why waste resources and time and training on something like a wiki
<Bronysith> ZOMBIES OMGMOMOGMOMGOMGOMGOGMGOGM
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Rombies
<Shizuka> 13if i think "i want to know about X" i first have to know when X was discussed
<twilight_sprinkle> imagine if they started killing them
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Myrei> ZOMBie tiem
<Dken2021_> they be in truoble
<CCCP> ITS MIAMI!!!!!
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Kyiko> overkill XD
<GilDash> pikorar: I need you to go into your control pannel and tell me what ports you are having problems with, sir.
<Pajaro> PLAGUE
<MahBoi777> ding ding ding
<Acleps> I like the amount of zombie comments :D
<Ponies47> cachi01: Agreed :)
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: there would be minimal training, and i'm not sure what "resources" you're talking about other than me and shizu's time
<Meanwhile> Erryday ahm pentapox.
<MahBoi777> no touchie
<Ghosties> 04It would be about as used as the forums
*Om has pentapox
<Alchemist> Starting a realtionship just for the sake of having a relationship is the worst thing one could do.
<Ghosties> 04We already have a system in place
<Pajaro> little babby
<SuperBrony64> 11,02When the forums gets used to its full potential and actually checked regularly, then I'll be in favor of hearing how much better Wiki is than the forums. Right now, the forums aren't regularly posted on and checked. I'm almost certain a lot of our problems will solve themselves if people just use the forums on a daily basis.
<Ghosties> 04You're trading one thing for another
<Ponies47> Magical_pablez94: Okie doki loki :)

<Magical_pablez94> Ponies47: u know which kind of promise :D
<Saturn> 08,01so how about killing two birds with one stone and setting up the wiki *and* making sure we use it more?
<Pinkies4thWall> YIPYIP
<Ghosties> 04How about
<MahBoi777> Bronysith: Lol

<twilight_sprinkle> Gamer_Luna: i saw your jacki chan pic, its very nice :)
<Gamer_Luna> GilDash,what would you like me to draw? :)
<Saturn> 08,01because forums suck
<Ghosties> 04Why do you want to switch out one thing for a system we already have in place
<Ghosties> 04Oh please, Saturn

<Bronysith> alexxm: its anime what do u expect
<Saturn> 08,01moving to a better system is better for everyone in the long run

<Litwick> That fart noise.
<Invi> VioletGreySha how is it going? ^^
<Ghosties> 04When we were in talks about 2.0 we wanted to do wordpress from before the new year

<pikorar> Yes GilDash, I think it was 0000069.
<Shizuka> 13but why spend effort on doing it when you could have stuck with the old site
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<alexxm> Bronysith anyone can die
<pikorar> inb4 death.
<Ghosties> 04Why spend effort on something that we don't need
<Bronysith> alexxm: not the babies lol
<GilDash> pikorar: Okay... You ordered this from us 3 months ago, is that right?
<Ghosties> 04When we already have something that we can use
<VioletGreySha> Invi: good good my mother sits behind me while i skype and drink energy drinks xD
<Shizuka> 13you're missing the point
<Luna> the old site.. needed a new face / better backend structure
<CeilingKirz> personally, I'd have to agree that forums are a horrible way to retrieve information
<Meanwhile> Set the net on fire.
<pikorar> Yes GilDash.
<Dken2021_> god azula
<Ghosties> 04I just don't understand
<MahBoi777> FIRE makes everything better
<VioletGreySha> Invi: and you? :3
<Shizuka> 13why did we go to 2.0 rather than stick with the old site
*Magical_pablez94 ruffles alexxm 's mane too. ":)"
<Bronysith> BRILLIANT
<Meanwhile> Azula is such a tool.
<Shizuka> 13because the new was a better more effective way
<GilDash> Gamer_Luna: I'd ask you to draw my OC, but I have no idea what she looks like. :D
<Saturn> 08,01honestly ghosties, i'm not getting your argument here. shizu and i would set this up, we would use it, end of. no using up some finite resource, no work done really by anyone else other than us, and pretty much no training if we do it right
<ShiningArmor> Hi everyone
<Pinkies4thWall> Such a sadist
<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pokmon-keep-your-head-down2.jpg
<MahBoi777> release the hounds
<Ghosties> 04That's what you're saying in theory
<Dken2021_> allo ShiningArmor
<Meanwhile> Release the everything!
<ShiningArmor> lol elephant
<Litwick> ALL OF THE ANIMALS
<pikorar> They're living in the olden ages... I had no idea they even regarded personal safety.
<Acleps> That's one awesome circus
<Pajaro> elephantbear
<MahBoi777> hi ShiningArmor
<alexxm> hey ShiningArmor hows your day been
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: the contrary actually, she was manipulating the girl into joining her
<Ghosties> 04The wiki doesn't seem to be the be all end all to our communication troubles
*Magical_pablez94 noms Ponies47's mane
<Ponies47> BRB I gotta go brush my mane
<Shizuka> 13is 2.0 better than 1.0?
<Gamer_Luna> GilDash: I'll draw anything pony-related :)
<CCCP> hi ShiningArmor
<VioletGreySha> Gamer_Luna: your OC is next on my list just for soem information ^^
<ShiningArmor> OMG BABY
<Saturn> 08,01it's better to use the right tools for the job than to use bad tools "just because they're there"
<pikorar> Boomy is the name of my mine turtle... *Explosion*
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: What a story Mark.
<Invi> VioletGreySha I am just watching the stream ^^ my parents already sleep since 3 hours....
<Shizuka> 13^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<Pajaro> BABBY ADVENTURE 2
<Ghosties> 04Look at what I said, it does not seem to fix our communication trouble
<Dken2021_> dang it
<ShiningArmor> OMASHU
<twilight_sprinkle> Meanwhile: tell that to the writers
<Shizuka> 13we're tech, we know what we're doing
<Ghosties> 04It's not that
<Gamer_Luna> VioletGreySha: Yay! :)
<pikorar> Yes, because kidnapping is always a clever plot.
<VioletGreySha> Invi: ^^
<Skylands> 10http://bulk.destructoid.com/ul/23241-Kyubey.jpg
<Caramel> okay, how about this
<Meanwhile> twilight_sprinkle: I would but they, like me, don't really care.
<Saturn> 08,01yeah, i agree ghostie
<Ghosties> 04You think it's better from a technical viewpoint
<Caramel> going back to what super said
<GilDash> pikorar: Right, well... We can arrange for a new shipment to be sent to you for next Tuesday. We will collect the old products from you at this time too, so please be prepared to return them to us.
<CeilingKirz> the question should be "why aren't people using the forum", for me, it's because 1) nobody else is; and 2) forums are a pain to search through information
<Ghosties> 04But think about a communication perception
<Caramel> let's focus FOR NOW, on the not using it issue
<Dken2021_> they didn't even watch their son
<Saturn> 08,01but what i'm saying is that while we're at it, we introduce this system so that it's easier to use for everyone
<Pinkies4thWall> :O
<Bronysith> pikorar: dat plot
<Caramel> once people start getting that act together
<ShiningArmor> Azula did all that stuff so she could have that girl join her team
<Caramel> and USING the forums
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol wut?
<Caramel> let's open up the wiki discussion again
<Bronysith> ShiningArmor: eeyup
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: you know when I first met you, i thought you were an angel, but then I realized you were not an angel, you are a goddess...<3
<Pajaro> stick
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ye ShiningArmor
<pikorar> Yes GilDash, thank-you.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11I think Ghosties issue is that how will this work when we have more and more information to add and spread to the mod group?
<Ghosties> 04Work on a wiki, which means expending more work on a system that won't be used just like forums after six months
*ShiningArmor wacks sakka
<GilDash> Gamer_Luna: How about you draw my OC and you together. You have free reign as I've no idea what she looks like. :)
<Caramel> but for now, let's resolve the BIG issue
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> o hai ShiningArmor long time no see
<Dark_Horst> give him your weapon, sokka
<AlienEd27> yeah, let him play with a weapon
<Magical_pablez94> hi ShiningArmor ! how 're ya? any good news?
<MahBoi777> EVIL BABEH
<alexxm> yes let the toddler play with the sword
<Thorn> YOU SO CUUTE
<Ghosties> 04None of you are seeing the big point
*Nittany_Discord 11,01sees that this is going nowhere
<Ghosties> 04Explain to me
<pikorar> Hitler was a baby once.
<ShiningArmor> omg birdy
<Om> It does.
<GilDash> pikorar: Is there anything else I can help you with today, sir?
<pikorar> But he always had the mustache.
<Invi> oh wo wo cewt
<ShiningArmor> Hitler was a BABY!?
<Ghosties> 04How in the world will one means of medium work better than another when everything boils down to convenience
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if it's as easy to implement as Saturn says it is, it's not exactly a waste of work if it doesn't get used
<MahBoi777> NO WAI
<drfsupercenter> 03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-troll-untitled31.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03:ED
<Ghosties> 04And
<drfsupercenter> 03*:D
<Ghosties> 04We already have a system in place
<SaxyPretender> 0,14low risk/high potential reward works for me
<Ghosties> 04It's already active
<ShiningArmor> i thought he came right out of hell as an adult
<pikorar> GilDash: No sir, just put me on hold for the rest of the day. I like the music.
<twilight_sprinkle> nah, hitler was born with a moustache and his uniform
<Ghosties> 04Saxy
<Magical_pablez94> Irish_Pony: that's saccharine...
<Ghosties> 04You would be for BronyNation then
<MahBoi777> ShiningArmor: ikr
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm all in favor of making the forums more active for now and then if it continues to be a problem, we'll consider going to the Wiki option.
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: wiht all due respect, i'm not sure how much you can comment on the "work" that needs to be done setting it up, when me and shizu know exactly how much work will be expended on this, and have taken that into account
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: and teh heil salute
<ShiningArmor> :P
<Pajaro> NEIN
<ShiningArmor> YAY
<Kyiko> don't jinx it
<Shamroc> TRAP!
<ShiningArmor> DEATH!
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: You are the sweetest guy ever.I love you,my shining armor <3
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: ye lul
<MahBoi777> Fegelein!
<Luna> @Saxy what do you think about all the items that need to be copied over?
<Lil_B> Hitler ALMOST became an Artitst... and ALMOST an architect... but the unversitys refuses... i would have reatced the same way
<Acleps> bad joke?
<Meanwhile> huuuugs
<hen3ry> baby hitler always hated juice.
<RyunosukeKnT> emo girl is sooo emo
<SaxyPretender> 0,14copy + paste?
<AlienEd27> hey, Babies arn't evil, it is what they experience that defines their future actions
<Ghosties> 04But it just feels like you're swithcing out one gamble for another
<Luna> lol
<Thorn> Sure, go to the fire nation to die.
<ShiningArmor> LOL i thought she said Kill me in
<Gamer_Luna> GilDash: So,I can make you an OC free hand?
<Luna> goodluck with that
<GilDash> pikorar: I'm afraid we don't have a switchboard, sir. I cannot put you on hold.
<Kyiko> "I have a good feeling about this."= everything will go wrong
<Luna> tried that for the BS2.0 launch
<twilight_sprinkle> you came to omashu at a difficult time, at noon!
<Invi> Ryunosuke there is a difference between emo and depressed
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: there are two separate issues here. one of usage, and one of tooling
<GilDash> Gamer_Luna: You've got free reign. Just keep in mind she's one hell of a flirt. ;)
<Wrek> 05im willing to give the wiki a go
<pikorar> Hitler was angry as a little kid, when he learned that juice could not be burned, because he hated juice.
<ShiningArmor> Omg shes like rarity
<Lil_B> hen3ry he liked really concentraited jouce
<ShiningArmor> only much more evil and bossy
<Om> GilDash: You don't say?
<Ghosties> 04No
<Ghosties> 04It's communication
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not saying using a wiki will fix the usage, but it *will* fix the tooling
<Wrek> 05and worst case ghosties can say "told you so"
<ShiningArmor> New Ozai? Bad name :)
<Gamer_Luna> GilDash: I can work with that ;)
<Ghosties> 04Look at this from a team player position, not a tech one
<pikorar> Well then, GilDash, just sing to me.
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: yes, and that encompasses both those problems
<MahBoi777> lol
<Kyiko> team rocket
<ShiningArmor> OMG i thought that was a pig o-o
<Dken2021_> hai bumi!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> shits about to get srs
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: Who needs armor when all I need is a steel heart that you create....<3
<Thorn> HI EVERYBODEHH
<GilDash> pikorar: The water can be evaporated and the substance remaining burnt.
<Acleps> Hi doctor nick!
<alexxm> hey bumi
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, that doesn't mean I support BronyNation, that's more like high risk/mid potential reward
<MahBoi777> hi Thorn
<ShiningArmor> HAI Thorn
<Pajaro> bumi got swwag
<Ghosties> 04You're talking about it from a technical viewpoint though, prove to me that a wiki would be better than a forum
<CCCP> hi Thorn
<CCCP> thornberry*
<Ghosties> 04Because I honestly see the wiki dying in less than half a year
<Thorn> :3
<Meanwhile> Well that's nice.
<ShiningArmor> BYE BYE
<Ghosties> 04It'll end up just like the forums
<Invi> hi Thorn
<RaveBrony> Dat king :D
<CCCP> bye ShiningArmor
<MahBoi777> bai Bumi
<Ghosties> 04Where we start and then stop
<alexxm> hey Thorn hows your day been
<Sumica> 00,10I am confused. They are saying they will do the work yes?
<ShiningArmor> Im not leaving
<Pajaro> BUMI SWAG
<RyunosukeKnT> that bumi
<Thorn> good.
<Shizuka> 13Ghosties: i want to know about trilogy events, i currently have to wade through a time-based forum to find a thread that might be relevant to it
<GilDash> pikorar: I'm sorry sir, but I have other customers to deal with. If there is nothing else I can help you with I really must be going.
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: it's better because information remains canonical, from any source, without having to think temporally
<Ghosties> 04We have an idea and then it stops because we get bored and just go back to skype
<ShiningArmor> i said bye bye because bumi left o-o
<Shizuka> 13compare
<Litwick> Aang says fuck yo shit.
<theSHHAS> http://theshhas.deviantart.com/#/d528n5i
<Sumica> 00,10they being Saturn and Shizuka
<Thorn> been makin a homestuck rp.
<Shizuka> 13i want to know about trilogy events, it's there on the front page because it's a current thing
<theSHHAS> this is awesome!
<twilight_sprinkle> i hope hes bending to fly up like that
<Bronysith> Litwick: eeeyup
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: You have a way with words,my love. <3
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol bumi

<ShiningArmor> omg dat son of a bitch
<Bronysith> bumi is best derpy
<Meanwhile> Bumi is best king.
<MahBoi777> Ice Ice Baby
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: <3
<ShiningArmor> Freeze baby Freeze
<Shizuka> 13i'm with saturn and we could put this together in less than a day i'm certain
<pikorar> GilDash: But the stuff leftover after the water is evaporated is not juice.
<ShiningArmor> FALCON PAWNCH
<Thorn> Who doesnt fucking love bumi/
<twilight_sprinkle> curses, floor hands!
<cachi01> FINAL FUCKING LI
<ShiningArmor> ...to teh foot
<cachi01> WHITE CELESTIA
<RaveBrony> badass
<cachi01> FINALLY
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: I <3 you
<Magical_pablez94> Irish_Pony: i need ur OC image right now, ni jking please post it to me
<Ghosties> 04You're not going to change my opinion on this, the forum is just a much more convenient means because we already have it. If you want to do a wiki, fine, but I foresee it dying inevitably
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and given the fact that it's word processor easy, I don't think we need to worry about training
<ShiningArmor> PWNED
<GilDash> pikorar: It's the pigments/flavourings...
<Ghosties> 04It'll wind up just like forums
<Ghosties> 04Dead
<Thorn> HAND TO THE FOOT
<Magical_pablez94> no*
<Ghosties> 04And because then we'll be back here
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: that's a separate issue; the usage issue. as i said, what i'm talking about with the wiki won't fix that. but while we fix that by saysing "use this more", we also put in a more usable system
<Ghosties> 04Saying
<pikorar> But GilDash... It's not juice.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> how does water trip one?
<MahBoi777> wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<alexxm> so the kid became part of the resitance
<Shizuka> 13how about this
<ShiningArmor> Aang when azula jumped: O FUCK
<Ghosties> 04"Oh, wiki is dead, well, let's try something else"
<Shizuka> 13we make wiki
<theSHHAS> do anypony like this pic? http://theshhas.deviantart.com/#/d528n5i
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: I <3 you
<GilDash> pikorar: No. So the juice... has been destroyed. ;)
<cachi01> FINALLY A WHITE CELESTIA TOY
<CeilingKirz> -------------------------------------------
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: you're not getting the point
<ShiningArmor> WEEEEEEEEEE
<Shizuka> 13we fill the wiki with stuff
<Thorn> wheeee
<MahBoi777> that wud be fun
<Shizuka> 13we point at the wiki and the forums
<Ponies47> yay! :)
<ShiningArmor> Cart surfing
<Shizuka> 13and ask "which one is more useful"
<ShiningArmor> FTW
<Shizuka> 13THEN
<Shizuka> 13we decide which to keep
<Acleps> Cities with giant slides? I wish I could live there! :)
<CeilingKirz> ---------------------------------------------BAM--------------------------------------------
<CeilingKirz> back on topic
<GilDash> pikorar: Furtheemore, whilst fire can't "burn" juice, it can destroy it. :)
<AlienEd27> Minecraft should be like this
<Saturn> 08,01it's not about tryign a wiki to fix the usage problem, it's about using an appropriate tool and implementing a policy of usage
<MahBoi777> YES
<Ghosties> 04We were already on topic, Kirz -_-
<ShiningArmor> CRASH INTO TEH CABAGE MAN
<pikorar> Well GilDash, that's all fine and dandy, but hitler was more of an "all at once" sort of guy.
<Wrek> 05besides having a wiki will all the guides and ban lists and fuck all seems like a good idea anyways
<alexxm> why was the city bulit like this
<Thorn> MY CABBAGES!
<Bronysith> alexxm: for transportation
<AlienEd27> JUICE CAN EVAPORATE ^_^
<Ghosties> 04It's about apathy and convenience
<pikorar> Hitler loved to concentrate his juice before he burned it. See what I did there?
<MahBoi777> Egad! she can duck
<Pajaro> a white celestia toy that turns pink *hasbro trollface*
<ShiningArmor> pwned
<alexxm> thanks Bronysith
<Shizuka> 13the forum ban list failed because you either had to get one person to update the first topic, or read everything to find something relevant
<ShiningArmor> DOUBLE PWNED
<ShiningArmor> TRIPLE PWN
<Ghosties> 04Convenience and communication
<Saturn> 08,01yes, and using a wiki will fix the latter of those two, ghosties
<AlienEd27> hope i didn't misspell that
<Ghosties> 04That's what you say
<RaveBrony> o.o
<Pajaro> chi blockage
<ShiningArmor> ULTIMATE PWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Saturn> 08,01the convenience, i mean
<Shizuka> 13you don't believe us?
<MahBoi777> APPA TO THE RESCUE
<Ghosties> 04You can do it, go ahead
<Thorn> PRESSURE POINT!
<pony_9996> Is this lagging for anyone else?
<RaveBrony> Damn! :D
<Ghosties> 04I just don't think it'll work
<Darkts3> yay came just in time for avatar
<Meanwhile> Dat tail.
<Ghosties> 04I just foresee it dying
<GilDash> pikorar: Amongst his greater failings.
<Om> Chi block Appa I dare you
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_9996: not for me
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> kapow
<Ponies47> EPIC! :O
<Ghosties> 04And then we'll be trying to find another excuse to use for failed communication
<alexxm> you know sokka is actully pretty badass
<MahBoi777> shet
<ShiningArmor> FAIL
<Ghosties> 04Pardon my bitterness
<Caramel> all I care about is the using it issue getting resolved
<Ponies47> FAIL! :O
<Meanwhile> Where's cabbage guy when you need him?
<pikorar> Like his hairstyle, GilDash.
<Caramel> as far as forums or wiki goes, I could care less
<MahBoi777> Fire Saw
<Dken2021_> alexxm badass normal

<Bronysith> um.. dat plot
<ShiningArmor> SHIIIIIIITTTTT
<pikorar> THE CRIMSON CHIIIIN!
<MahBoi777> manly chin
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: as the organiser of a large event, large society commities, and of large software projects in the past, i can say with some amount of authority that a wiki will be a better solution than a forum
<alexxm> thanks Bronysith
<Ponies47> Where is cabbage guy? This would be perfect right about now :'(
<Meanwhile> Like a Bumi
<Ghosties> 04Go ahead
<Acleps> pikorar: Where have I heard that before?

<Bronysith> well techinaccaly there are 85!

<Ponies47> :o
<Ghosties> 041 Now, one thing I see as in issue at this current time is BronyCon. We were given passes to go to the convention, but I have not seen any word of what hotel or what times or basically any of that important stuff. In order to even get there, we have to know what time and how many nights we get to have the hotel. Additionally, since a few of our teammates are going to meetup at BronyCon,
<Ghosties> 4shouldn't we have at least a little something planned, like a stream of the event or a group local multiplayer gaming stream, etc? Please give more information and ideas.
<Meanwhile> CCCP I'm gonna embrace your face with a concrete block.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And your parents don't know you're a brony, so they definitely won't drive you there.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Can't go myself cause I don't have a car yet. Also, my mom doesn't know I'm a brony and she will obviously ask me where I'm headed.

<Deleted_dreams> :(
<pikorar> They kind of do, Acleps...
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: it needs moar bacon

<CCCP> MY PLANET NEEDS ME!!!!!!!!~
<Ponies47> MORE BANJOS! :D
<Bronysith> Sumica: and blunderpusses
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: Tea parties?
<Ghosties> 042 Next, I noticed we still have not done much concerning that "Downloads/Community Projects" section I proposed a few weeks ago. This would allow us to get more acquainted with other members of the fandom. We could review and backup any willing participants in this program. Some people and projects already in line for review and post are Flaria's cursors, MrEvergreen's pony game, and
<Ghosties> 4possibly some custom Desktop Ponies of our staff members' OCs created by a small group of people whom I have met: Flaria (known for making cursors) or Vordox (a spriter for 10 years, the creator of a current custom Desktop pony of one of our staff members, and the one who gave me the idea to create more Desktop ponies in the future) or one of herospirit's friends (works on making sprites of
<Ghosties> 4Pony Emblem, a crossover of Ponies and Fire Emblem). I'd like to see more thought put into something like this in the future.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11You all get some way to keep in touch with each other and plan the trip out. Take pictures, get a video or something, or stream if you want. That said, next point.
<Acleps> pikorar: But not the real american redneck accent
<Sumica> 00,10trust in the heart of the swamp
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: needs seapony lyra
<StupidSexyCJ> Its Harold!
<Dark_Horst> whoa. tree
<GilDash> Gamer_Luna: Thank you. <4
<GilDash> Gamer_Luna: <3
<Tov|Christmas> Its like the heart of the cards
<Bronysith> Sumica: super special awesome swamp
<Petrified_Discord> Use the treephone
<HyperMetalLugia> YAY
<drf|away> 03so apparently ABC Family is required by contract to air Christian fundie programming >_>
<Shizuka> 13a downloads page would be trivial to implement, but you would want enough content on it to make it look like it belongs
<pikorar> Acleps: Um... Then you should talk to my redneck friends.
<Pajaro> the force
<drf|away> 03and to keep "family" in their name
<drf|away> 03for as long as the channel exists
<Gamer_Luna> GilDash: Welcome :)
<Pinkies4thWall> AAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<alexxm> GilDash i was just messing with you
<Bronysith> Pajaro: what about the force?
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm good so far, thanks.......you heard about Orton, right? Word is that two more WWE superstars might have failed the wellnes policy
<Dken2021_> swamp thing!
<HyperMetalLugia> My mother can use youtube now
<Shizuka> 13having just flaria's cursors would look a bit sparse, or worse
<drf|away> 03I was a bit surprised to see some random religious speaker after watching Harry Potter
<GilDash> alexxm: I'll be messing with you... ;)
<RaveBrony> ded
<Bronysith> TANKK

<Ghosties> 04I kinda like the idea of a downloads page
*GilDash kisses Gamer_Luna.
<HyperMetalLugia> as in, she is left handed
<HyperMetalLugia> :D
<Meanwhile> Swamp thing is unhappy.
<Acleps> pikorar: What do you mean? Don't they have an accent?
<alexxm> who else Dark92Enigma
<Skylands> 10Oh u
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: Gamer luna? I'm a fan of her!
<Pajaro> oh hey, a hentai monster
<Fluttercute> Gamer Luna nice pic
<Ghosties> 04But yeah, more material would be needed before implementation
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah me too, but I agree that we'd need to have a lot more content to put into it
<Sumica> 00,10damn katar is bad ass in this one
<Fluttercute> :P
<Shizuka> 13i've been thinking of reorganizing the nav menu so that paintchat isn't on the main bar, under a menu if anything
<PrincessLuna> Evening everyone
<HyperMetalLugia> The churches are holding TV for ransom these days
<Pinkies4thWall> I've seen enough hentai...
<Shizuka> 13the menu is a bit of a navigational mess at the moment
<Luna> it sounds interesting
<Bronysith> PrincessLuna: hello how are you?
<Sumica> 00,10first time we get to see her bend after training
<Dken2021_> evening PrincessLuna
<Midnight_Tempest> katara became more awesome in the ep
<Petrified_Discord> Ohai PrincessLuna
<pikorar> Yes, they do, Acleps, and their accents are varying amounts of "southern".
<Pinkies4thWall> Sweet.

<Acleps> pikorar: I see... But then what makes them rednecks? The way they live?
<drf|away> 03apparently it used to be owned by FOX
<Vordox> Hai Wrek?
<Shizuka> 13so the main point of contention is how much is under downloads
<Gamer_Luna> GilDash: Wipes away kiss.I didn't need that
<Dark92Enigma> alexxm Don't know....that's all i know at the moment
<drf|away> 03And they sold it to Disney

<SirSilverscreen> 1,11The current navigation isn't that bad. :/

*Irish_Pony nibbles on Gamer_Luna's ear

<BlueFlare> 02who cares what hand it caters to
<PrincessLuna> Bronysith: That would be awesome :) I think Brom definitely had an interesting lifestyle, especially with the fall of the riders
<HyperMetalLugia> I know right
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies I'm not going.....i made a Wally Gator reference
<Shizuka> 13it's disjointed, mostly on account of us having a wide variety of things that need to be one click away

<Fluttercute> lyra that is danerous get out of the water
<BlueFlare> 02news*
<Yahooz> *ahem*
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47 I'm not going, i made a Wally Gator reference
<Ghosties> 04Moving on unless there's some other reason to continue on the downloads
<Shizuka> 13but anyway, downloads can happen, resolved that we need more to put there
<Chrysalis> FlareChaser nice
<Deleted_dreams> YA DON't SAY
<Skylands> 10Politics, not hands
<Fluttercute> boom like a boss
<alexxm> naked man
<GilDash> FlareChaser: Please. Try Twilight or Fluttershy...
<drf|away> 03LOL @ that former playboy model talking about her daughters losing their virginity
<Dark92Enigma> SO?
<drf|away> 03don't ask why I watched that
<Fluttercute> :P
<Ghosties> 045 Also, I see we are needing to figure out our summer. This, my friends, is Summer 2.0. The summer that will outdo the previous one. A hard feet I know, but with enough planning we can do it. We'll need to prepare what exactly we should do for this summer. This summer will set the grounds for tradition in future summers. June, July, and August are our months. We need to plan for each day
<Ponies47> Dark92Enigma: O. I walked away for a sec.
<Ghosties> 4within them. Games, movies, muzik, and whatever else we can dish out to make this summer the best one ever.
<Fluttercute> :D
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Desktop Ponies, artist wallpapers. Music selections. Flash game files.
<pikorar> Acleps: Well, they usually wear camo hats, generally have shaved heads, they're usually very bulky, or very tall and lanky...
<StupidSexyCJ> wait wat?
<Petrified_Discord> Um...no. You just tried to kill us. :|
<Ghosties> 04So, sounds like he just wants more of an idea of what's going to happen for Summer
*PrincessLuna pokes Petrified_Discord
<Ponies47> *Hugs Fluttercute* She's so cute :)
<Fluttercute> Huma huma huma huma huma huma huma
<Dark92Enigma> Just a regular guy that tried TO KILL US
<Shizuka> 13well since the one idea from my get-out-of-my-head brain dump, trilogy month, is going forward
<Darkts3> FLUTTERSHY
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: WHO VOTES FLUTTERSHY?! Anyone?
<Meanwhile> Enlightened old swamp guy.
<Petrified_Discord> PrincessLuna: Yeeeeeeeessss? :)
<Shizuka> 13the only other real idea i had there was more gaming events
<pikorar> And, Acleps, they usually drive a pick-up truck, go hunting and love mud balling.
<Shizuka> 13L4D2 went well i think
<Ghosties> 04Yeah...I'm kinda inclined to believe that...that's about it for now
<Ghosties> 04Unless, yeah, more gaming events
<PrincessLuna> Petrified_Discord: I unno 6_9
<GilDash> PrincessLuna: Hello there. ;)

<alexxm> seems legit
<Dark_Horst> whoa... TREE!

<Airpuff> GilDash: Seems i got away with it pretty unscathed :P
*Midnight_Tempest listens hard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The My Little Investigations dev stream I want to do.
<Ghosties> 04But this point could take all day, so, maybe decide something now?
<sagas> Hello, everypony!
<CeilingKirz> only thing with game events, need more people for them, can't do another mod vs viewer l4d event
<Ponies47> PrincessLuna: O hello your majesty *Bows down*
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: I wub you <3
<pikorar> If you ever met a redneck, Acleps, then you would want to punch his/her mouth. They're annoying.
<Ghosties> 04Okay, TF2, MLI
<GilDash> Airpuff: You weren't the one who put it on...
<Dark92Enigma> Or this FLUTTERSHY ------->:(
<Dken2021_> deep
<Om> You can feel everything growing.
<Ponies47> Hye hey hey sagas
<alexxm> hey sagas hows you rday been
<Acleps> pikorar: That's what I thought. Plus beer. Rednecks love beer. (at least that's what the tb has taught me)
<Tov|Christmas> Colonel Quarrich should blow that tree up.
<Dken2021_> allo sagas
<Ghosties> 04Oh
<Petrified_Discord> PrincessLuna: K :D
<CeilingKirz> not enough mods for the number of games to cover everyone, gets tiring fast
<Ghosties> 04Uh
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11And if we get the streamer to go Spectator mode on TF2, it'd make some good shots.
<Pajaro> troll swamp
<PrincessLuna> Ponies47: Hello loyal subject! :)
<Airpuff> GilDash: But im the one who grabbed it and said "Giddy up" xD
<pikorar> Acleps: moonshine.
<Acleps> pikorar: TV*
<Dark92Enigma> The Fluttershy talked! :( yaaaaaaaaaay
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: I wub you too,honey. <3
<Shizuka> 13i discovered gaming department is building up a list of viewer's gaming accounts, and they're listing what games they have there
<PrincessLuna> Petrified_Discord: Say wha?!
<Luna> yep
<Acleps> pikorar: That's homemade alcohol right?
<Luna> it has been linked too
<Ghosties> 04Kirz had been talking about possibly doing a BronyState Autumn banner
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: Princess Luna?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A member build up that list.
<drf|away> 03Instead, the channels feature the defamation of Christians <- now that, I can't argue with :P
<BlueFlare> 02Left handed people are better at using their right hand then right handed people are at trying to use their left hand
<PrincessLuna> Matrix
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: *kisses* <3
<Meanwhile> Time is an illusion, true facts.
<Shizuka> 13so given that could easily build up a list of multiplayer games that most people could join
<Ghosties> 04So that could be done this Summer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't remember who.
<pony_7694> Hey
<Tov|Christmas> I thought time was a social construct
<Ponies47> PrincessLuna: Your the best princess! :)
<cachi01> queen luna!
<Dken2021_> The X's? haven't seen that show in awhile
<sagas> alexxm: Tiring. Didnt get much sleep
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I would love to have that list linked on our site.
<pikorar> I have no idea Acleps, but I hear rednecks talk about it all the time.
<drf|away> 03also, way to generalize BlueFlare

<Shizuka> 13it has been three months since
<pikorar> I miss the science...
<Magical_pablez94> sagas: easy reading from title uh?
<Caramel> because it was agreed the artist's spotlight page was there to stay...
<Shizuka> 13if you want to yell at me for it, the window of relevance is long past
<Acleps> I should call the seaponies just so they would come here, and I'd get to see them suffer a slow painful death due to lack of water. THAT would be the best day of my life.
<PrincessLuna> She blinded me with...science
<FlareChaser> PrincessLuna: ....the amount of princess's in this chat is too damn high!
<Shizuka> 13it can go back
<Ponies47> Pinkies4thWall: Didn't know dat

<Caramel> I understand that
<GilDash> Acleps: And then we could watch Evil Dead. It would be amazing! :)
<pikorar> Acleps: :( But I like the sea ponies, they're the only pre-64 pony meme that's worth mentioning.
<PrincessCelestia> its not that damn high!!!!
<sagas> Magical_pablez94: yep. I could tell though even without the title though
<Caramel> but I'm just not sure where the communication was
<Gamer_Luna> Did anybody see the Teens react to MLP?All the girls said no to a Brony boyfriend!I would love a brony boyfriend.
<CrimsonPhoenix> wat
<PrincessCelestia> oh. yeah it is
<FlareChaser> LOL
<Acleps> GilDash: Only if we watch Buried.
<Caramel> why the call was made without any discussion
<PrincessMoist> FlareChaser, it's not high enough
<Woodenfan|doing> ah buck it, gonna get pizza for my family
<CrimsonPhoenix> ok so I can't register myself?
<pikorar> Sorry, Acleps, I said 64, I mean G4, derp.
<Pajaro> the amount of adorableness is NOT HIGH ENOUGH.

<Meanwhile> What a story whoever you are.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11We're off topic.
<DerpSurge> OH MY
<Ghosties> 04Okay so
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Next point.
<CrimsonPhoenix> yes that's the main jizz of that controller
<Soital> 12Apparently I'm a 12-15 year old boy too
<Irish_Pony> Cool!
<Tov|Christmas> My TV is a small screen
<Chrysalis> oh wow splitscreen
<Ghosties> 04Let's sum up the Summer Slurry thing real quick
<CrimsonPhoenix> LETS DRAW PONIES
<pikorar> The controllers are cool, but what are the features of the actual system?
<Dark_Horst> Nittany_Discord: don
<Soital> 12fun times~
<Pinkies4thWall> DAT LINK
<Tov|Christmas> drawing skills may vary
<cachi01> DAT LINK
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don?
<cachi01> DAMN Pinkies4thWall
<GilDash> I am still not interested in all this damned motion control crap.
<Ghosties> 04Artist spotlight, game streams, MLI, favicon contest
<Ghosties> 04Okay
<Ghosties> 04Next
<Dark_Horst> Nittany_Discord: 't know aquat about consoles, elaborate?
<DerpSurge> Booo Link
<Meanwhile> I share Yahtzee Croshaw's opinion of E3.
<cachi01> NINJA
<Gamer_Luna> Everypony type in who you love most in this chat! :)
<Om> I like to don pitahs
<Ghosties> 046 And here's this: team conduct. I have noticed a few people here misbehaving and acting rudely. Now, I know it's not as bad as some things, but it's something to note and really should be toned down. We don't need people ignoring our own rules and abusing power. It's unprofessional and is just plain wrong. Know what's right, get things done, and have fun.
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Which is?
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: You <3
<Deleted_dreams> That's kinda cool..
<Magical_pablez94> sagas: don't get it sorry... may u explain a bit more simply.. im not that good at eng :d
<pikorar> THEY NEED TO WOK TOGETHA!
<red_ony> Looking at this I might have a future as an English language spokesperson..I'm German but I'd do better than him at least.. :/
<Sumica> 00,10oh look a new rythem hevin device
<Ponies47> EVERYPONY! I WUB EVERYPONY! :)
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ^^
<Meanwhile> GilDash: That it can piss off because it's pointless.
<Pinkies4thWall> NINTENDO IS A GENIUS
<cachi01> DAT SENSOR
<GilDash> Gamer_Luna: That's a though one... ;)
<Dark_Horst> Nittany_Discord: yeah, the enter key on my laptop is a sneaky bastard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dark_Horst: There are some bad rumors about the next gen Xbox and Playstation.
<Dken2021_> I don't like touch screens, have to friggin clean them everytime
<DerpSurge> Meanwhile: promotion time?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Gyro sensors?
<Petrified_Discord> pikorar: By our powers combined!
<Derpyty> http://www.mindistortion.tv/iwantyoursoul/?i_am=Derpyty
<Chrysalis> so six axis
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Fair point. :)
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy:As my friends say "I will not be a doormat"!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it'll detect food?
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord: as far as I'm concerned, they ruined the Wii and 3DS with the whole "bricking the system for custom firmware" thing. If Wii U is clear of that, I'll be a fan of theirs again.
<red_ony> he talks so slowly.. :/
<Acleps> I have a feeling that the 2 screen system won't work for everone, end there will be a lot of problems with it...
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: You <3
<Chrysalis> and phone tech
<Pinkies4thWall> Dat binoculars
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ps4 is coming out end of next year
<Dken2021_> silly saxy
<Chrysalis> and always useless
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11First of all, I want to say that there's a difference between abuse of power and playing around with each other.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>
<Magical_pablez94> Derpyty: u fucking soul stealer!
*Irish_Pony kisses Gamer_Luna <3
<CupcakeWarrior> Hi everyone, is this E3 we are watching?
<sagas> Magical_pablez94: What?
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: i think the worst of all is that the next xbox wont read already used xbox games
<Derpyty> duh fuq

<SuperBrony64> 11,02CupcakeWarrior: yes
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Xbox wants to ban used games. So does the PS4. And then Sony has a patent for hardware that interrupts your games for ads.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11We're a site of fun, not stuck-up business bullshit. Unless it's a serious official stream, we don't have to put on as much of a serious act.
<Irish_Pony> Magical_pablez94: eeyup <3
<GilDash> Magical_pablez94: A little too cute for me...

<CrimsonPhoenix> NO
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy:*sees a book* Ugh! I hate reading!
<Petrified_Discord> I love the noonchuck controller
<Chrysalis> there will be a delay stupid lying spokesperson
<Shizuka> 13how about this
<SuperBrony64> 11,02woah
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: You have the cutest voice <3
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash: u're rough and we all know it :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Sony wanted to do game registrations (which meant that you can't play your game on someone else's system).
<Om> Magical_pablez94: sleap like a rock
<Shizuka> 13if anyone comes to you with a complaint of power abuse
<Pinkies4thWall> HORY SHEET
<SuperBrony64> 11,02xbox
<Pajaro> CHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOP
<Pinkies4thWall> asgjkladfghdsfghl'as
<CrimsonPhoenix> wow

<Ponies47> What was dat sandvich
<Petrified_Discord> Dat controller :D
<Dark_Horst> well, that
<SaxyPretender> 0,14wow
<Shizuka> 13think very critically about how you've been presenting yourself and others
<Pajaro> i know chopnese
<GilDash> Magical_pablez94: I can do cute too. Nopony seems to want it... :(
<Sumica> 00,10looks like old sega
<Magical_pablez94> Om:thanks
<Dark_Horst> s a real dickmove from sony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd rather go Nintendo or nothing.
<sagas> Magical_pablez94: You said you'de make my OC next time we meet. I said Ide hold you to it.
<Darkts3> lol xbox controller
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany_Discord: So if I buy a PS4, the games will have ads in them?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that looks pretty sweet
<Dken2021_> that's totally not a dualshock controller
<cachi01> dat wii u pro controller looks nices
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11For example: I stopped kicking other mods during BMN nights because I know it's unprofessional, but if I show up, like Wednesday during a random Let's Play stream, I'll just play around with my mod abilities.
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: You are the cutess thing <3
<pikorar> AKA xBox controller copyright infringer 2.0.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CupcakeWarrior: Don't know.
<DerpSurge> Nittany_Discord: I'll use PC games only if they enable that. :|
<cachi01> me gusta
<Caramel> to go with that
<Lil_B> Owao = overall :D
<Shizuka> 13see it from their perspective, because they may not be seeing it as someone having fun with others
<Caramel> no one should be afraid to make those complaints
<Tov|Christmas> so much Ikea
<Magical_pablez94> GilDash: i do, dear that's why i usually am kind with u. *cuddles*
<Acleps> So you'll need more than 2 hands if you want to have the new controller, and the old Wii controllers
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: <:(
<CupcakeWarrior> When does the Wii U come out?
<pikorar> My Wii is not in my living room... Whatchu talkin' 'bout!?
<Dken2021_> and then the wii collected dust for 3 years
<Chrysalis> yes, it meant loads of people spent money, used it for a few weeks then let it gather dust
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord: I can imagine it would make sense to have a console that would interrupt games for emerency announcements, such as evacuation orders for natural (or less than natural) disasters.
<Sumica> 00,10and more tvs were broken that year the nany other year
<Shizuka> 13if i'm a viewer see a mod show up out of nowhere and start playing with power, that's unprofessional and lowers my opinion of the staff as a whole
<cachi01> xd
<Pajaro> is every theatre streaming the same thing?
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: You are the most sweetest person I've ever met,sweetie <3
<Om> Distand locations aka. the bathroom
<Shizuka> 13we can be playful
<Ghosties> 04Have balance, boys and girls; be fun, but be serious when you need to be ;)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: I actually would like that.
<Caramel> I'm not going to put any names and whatnot (though we all already know I'm talking about myself), but if you feel like someone is being rude to you, just tell them
<Dken2021_> Pajaro the theatres are just for the chatrooms
<Petrified_Discord> Wii U does what WE DID. Haha. :)
<CeilingKirz> if there's a reason behind the fun kick and it's not just "hey, I can kick another mod, let's do that", then it's ok
<CupcakeWarrior> Gamer_Luna and Irish_Pony: D'awwwwwww
<Cottencandy_111> ok. free samples for everypony.
<Lil_B> Must... not...l look... at chatroom... some poeple are beeing stupid again...
<pikorar> Wii U does what (Wii/We) did. I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE!
<Caramel> again: communication
<cachi01> so i can clop and play at the same time? NINTENDO I LOVE YOU
<Pinkies4thWall> "INB4 i play wii u on the john
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A game interrupted by an NWS warning. I like that a lot.
<Acleps> in a bitter wa?
<Meanwhile> Who has a Wii in the reading room?
<Vordox> Nintendo has something that almost no other Console have, except very very few exceptions, Local Games.
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11True, but really if it's not during an official stream, they can't expect us to act too official and professional.
<Tov|Christmas> no, please keep explaining
<Chrysalis> competting?
<Shizuka> 13but they do
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: Then its true, the gods have blessed me with a angel....<3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's WHEN you want to interrupt a game.
<Om> THANK YOU!
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, they kinda do
<Magical_pablez94> sagas: what do you mean with "hold" i a yes or a nope?
<CupcakeWarrior> The Wii U is single player only, right?
<Shizuka> 13it's the same channel on and off movie night
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: We *all* know that'd be abused.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not to sell you something.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02GAMES
<Cottencandy_111> :=(
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh boy here we go
<Lil_B> CupcakeWarrior nope
<Caramel> unfortunately, silver

<sagas> Magical_pablez94: Ha that means yes :D
<cachi01> ZOMBIES
<ScootaChicken> Dat acting
<Kandarihu> If that means running into Sony's patents, then only the people playing PS4 would be the only current-gen gamers to survive a tsunami, or an NCB attack.
<Darkts3> BLACK OPS 2?????
<Caramel> I dislike it, yes, but that's just how the winds are blowing
<Deleted_dreams> SHITTAKE

<Ghosties> 04So the last of Slurry's topic is uh
<Petrified_Discord> GabeMoist: ^
<Dken2021_> ever since I lost wii sports, the mii channel is useless
*Ghosties laughs lightly
<Irish_Pony> Oh hey I found Wrek's morning pill http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d52a9va
<Vordox> I SEE Gaming Scenes increasing options!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Thanks Nintendo for kicking the crud out of the Xbox 360 and PS3 ^-^
<CK|MoarDed> Also, Wii U. Oh god. They'
<CupcakeWarrior> I am so going to video call everyone
<cachi01> NINTENDO I LOVE U+
<CK|MoarDed> They're gonna highlight that all of E3.
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Havenät they always...?
<CK|MoarDed> ;_;
<Dken2021_> it's a gun
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 are you serious? you LIKE this?
<Aristeo> Hey Curly <3
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: * wings start falping *
<sagas> I have absolutly no desire for this Wii U. They're gonna have to try harder than this
<Darkts3> dammit im going to be forced to buy a crappy Xbox 720 just for halo
<Chrysalis> how can anyone like this
<Meanwhile> Chrysalis: Some people have no taste.
<CK|MoarDed> SB64: Only took them 8 years.
<alexxm> miis love guns
<Ghosties> 04Alright
<Curly> hey ^^
<Tov|Christmas> I want a gun
<cachi01> NINTEDNO Y U MAKE ME WAIT TILL CHRISTMAS!!
<Curly> how's you?
<Sumica> 00,10oh look built in marketing device
<Darkts3> did he just say..
<Aristeo> I'm okay :o
<Dark_Horst> so yeah... it's a 3d interface for lobbies
<Insert_cupc4ke> i refuse to belive that people can be excited for this
<fluttercry> 05,15what did I miss? what does it do that's so amazing!?
<Welsh_Pony> Miiverse
<Acleps> I'm intrugued by this...
<Meanwhile> Console wars are amusing because they will always be inferior to the PC.
<Om> Mebers?
<Chrysalis> no shiiiit
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh yay, I can watch the Sony presentation to see if the PS4 will be any good
<cachi01> the miivers
<RAWRity> the Miiverse looks a lot like Nintendogs
<twilight_sprinkle> woooaaaahhh
<red_ony> wooooah
<Aristeo> Been busy starting up a company >.<
<Meanwhile> Dirty console playing peasants.
<Ghosties> 04Well, he said to skip Brony Funds
<Kandarihu> So, is the Wii U going to support HD?
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: :(
*GilDash is insanely bored now.
<CK|MoarDed> Yes.
<GabeMoist> fluttercry, Mii Wara Wara
<Lil_B> you don't say :O
<Vordox> fluttercry: Awesominity...
<Petrified_Discord> Kandarihu: Yes
<Derpy_Hooves> mind blown
<pikorar> I'm not impressed by this at all, and the controllers cannot be practical, they have to cost at least $70 a piece.
<Darkts3> kandarihu: ya
<Gamer_Luna> Lies down next to Irish_Pony to watch this <3
<Darkts3> Pc is still best
<GilDash> pikorar: I'd put the price much, much higher.
<pikorar> ^
<Aristeo> Kinda lost track of everything else
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: Aww you...<3
<fluttercry> 05,15Mii...Wara....Wara?
<Vordox> Darkts3: That's not a console, silly
<sagas> This looks like a waist of money
<Tov|Christmas> When is he gonna announce Nintendogs U?
<RAWRity> also, Why is this announcement sounding more like a Training Video for people working at a Restaraunt?
<Ghosties> 04But it is an important thing to discuss since it's related to BronyState in a way...
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: :'(
<Insert_cupc4ke> PC is both best and worse
<Pinkies4thWall> fluttercry: it's basically the new iphone. ask SuperBrony64
<Chrysalis> Darkts3 +1 to that
<CupcakeWarrior> Ohai fluttercry
<Darkts3> Vordox: yes it is
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. That's his child.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02pikorar: You do realize an Xbox 360 controller is $60...right?
<Acleps> pikorar: Someone just said they would be 200$
<CK|MoarDed> Wii U supports 1080p and apparently the internet. So it's finally caught up to the last generation of consoles after only 8 years or so.
<Kandarihu> fluttercry: it means Mii rabble rabble
<DerpSurge> fluttercry: you just missed the worst commercial nerd ever :D
<Dark_Horst> fluttercry: *wii wara wara
<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64: You do realise that the wii is for little girls...right?
<CupcakeWarrior> CK|MoarDed: Ikr
<alexxm> hey fluttercry hows this day been
<Aristeo> how about you?
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, but he intended for it to be with BronyState during BronyNation
<Vordox> DerpSurge: BEST Commercial GUYS ;)
<cachi01> let me fuck us?
<Ghosties> 04At least I believe
<CK|MoarDed> Congrats, Nintendo, you're only about a decade behind the curve.
<Darkts3> CK|MoarDed: not true.. xbox 360 and ps3 run on 720p
<Ran> 2!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Ran, you are a 4Mew.
<Ghosties> 04I don't want to put words in his mouth
<Pinkies4thWall> Teckest
<Ran> 2:<
<sagas> RAWRity: Welcome to Nitendo Sports Bar. May I take your order?
<pikorar> SuperBrony64: Well then take that and put a screen on it. Maybe $150.
<CupcakeWarrior> Darkts3: They have 1080p
<Ghosties> 04So then...do we discuss Brony Funds later when he's around?
<Invi> if such a touch pad thingy dingie breaks, it will be very expensive
<Chrysalis> how the hell is a touchscreen simpler
<red_ony> slow tyoing is slow
<Chrysalis> than a damn keyboard
<Tov|Christmas> channel guide
<Meanwhile> The PS3 is for folks who didn't want a car, Xbox is for frat boys, and the wii is for middle aged women and small children.
<RAWRity> sagas: yeah, I'd like a console that doesn't use SD cards for memory.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Depends on if we can get everyone back together when he's around.
<sagas> Fuck this is gonna be worse than the 3DS
<Shizuka> 13SuperBrony64: for that price, i could buy six games, lolconsoles
<Chrysalis> get glasses
<Tov|Christmas> I <3 This Gun
<Dark_Horst> that'S probably becasue their tv sucks
<Darkts3> =/
<Insert_cupc4ke> so many drawn dicks
<red_ony> >3
<CK|MoarDed> Darkts3: Assuming you're correct (and I don't think you are) then that makes it still a good 5-6 years behind. >_>
<Irish_Pony> I <3 Gamer_Luna
<Darkts3> so its a bamboo tablet in disguise?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: Why can't you let me have fun ;~;
*CupcakeWarrior hugs SuperBrony64
<Chrysalis> Dat Wrek ping timeout
*SuperBrony64 hugs CupcakeWarrior back ;A;
<Bobeh> YAY FLIPNOTE

*Pinkies4thWall rallies to SuperBrony64's cause
<Meanwhile> Because dirty console playing peasants.

<Chrysalis> oh wow, damn smileys
<Insert_cupc4ke> does this help me play games?
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: So many "non console" people understand the joy of consoles here. :( Cause they do not have the upbrining of the amazing eras of Console and the experience coming from it.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SCREENSHOTS

<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: Fine! we stick with this dum video!*Flys off*
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: that's half the fun
<Dark_Horst> i like how he advertises stuff that has been used by gamers for years already as TOTALLY NEW AND VISIONARY!! one could think he'D be working for apple
<CupcakeWarrior> Pffft, empathy
<Om> Em pah the?
<Meanwhile> As if you could possibly spoil anything Nintendo does, because they've done it all already.
<Ghosties> 04I agree as well...anyone else?
<Chrysalis> empathy between players
<Petrified_Discord> CK|MoarDed: Spoiler alert Bowser kidnaps Peach
<twilight_sprinkle> empathy. in actuality, hate
<Luna> I agree
<Cottencandy_111> *BOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM*
<RAWRity> So now everypony can see how many times SuperBrony64 dies at Ray-Man
<Lil_B> Sometimes i think Nintendo isn't that great, but then i look at Microsoft and Sony... and i see they Nintendo may isn't that special, but still better then the other 2
<Chrysalis> yup, nintendo are in lala land
<cachi01> all this for the price of 100000000 dollars!!
<Bobeh> I heard that Portal is gonna be on the Wii U.
<Luna> done with Slurry?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:<
<DerpSurge> Vordox: potential trolling, EXCELLENT :D
<CK|MoarDed> SOSHAL VINDOW
<Insert_cupc4ke> SPOILERS: Nintendo will be releasing a wii game, a mario game, a zelda game and many many more stagnant IP's
<cachi01> Bobeh: just maybe
<CupcakeWarrior> riving room
<Darkts3> Cant wait to play Batman on Wii U
<Ghosties> 04No...
<Insert_cupc4ke> Mii game*
<Sumica> 00,10problem is this is all based on japanise culture
<Ghosties> 04He mentioned forums
<twilight_sprinkle> with the Wii wara wara, insults can be even more personal!
<Ghosties> 04But
<alexxm> so is the small game a controller
<sagas> RAWRity: I rather watch him fail and rage at Remix 10
<Ghosties> 04Since we already said a mouthfull on that
<Shizuka> 13public ones i think
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What gaming IPs aren't stagnant?
<Sumica> 00,10it wont transfer well at all to the states
<LordCelestia> 0,5Already discussed
<Soital> 12:O
<FillyFlam> Sharing across time and space
<LordCelestia> 0,5oh
<Luna> I thought we discussed the forums enough
<Kandarihu> Sumica: I agree.
<Soital> 12!POKEMON
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 7Cobalion.
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: Did I heard Portal?
<Ghosties> 04Is it public?
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: and that's bad how?
<Dken2021_> Sumica true dat
<Insert_cupc4ke> Thats why we need ones
<Ghosties> 04I don't think so...
<LordCelestia> 0,5Not sure
<CK|MoarDed> You forgot to mention that they're also making a new Smash Bros.
<Luna> let's keep the forums for BN or something
<CupcakeWarrior> inb4 privacy invasions
<Chrysalis> Sumica or europe
<Invi> dem cuts lol
<Insert_cupc4ke> like Dishonoured and last of us
<Vordox> Sumica: Who cares about that "USA" That's so faulty and not even a country anymore?
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: what, they don
<Om> mebers
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01There are very few new IPs nowadays if you exclude the indie scene.
<Shizuka> 13yeah, that gets rolled in with BN
<Ghosties> 04But then PS has forums
<Ghosties> 04I dunno
<Dark_Horst> t have discussion forum or games there?
<Ghosties> 04We'll figure something out
<Chrysalis> oh no, DONT get involved in my single player
<Luna> yep
<Ghosties> 04ANYWAYS
<red_ony> That is precisely why I replay older titles
<Chrysalis> get the hell out of my single player
<Shizuka> 13at this point it would just be a matter of cost and administration, and whether the public would use it
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy:*Falls* uh oh. *BOOM!*
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Space and Time? O.O Time Machine
<Kandarihu> Vordox: the scary thing is that might be a reality by the time Wii U comes out.
<sagas> Holy SHIT! THEY HAVE A SPECTATOR MODE!
<Ghosties> 04Now Slurry is done
<CK|MoarDed> Steven Hawking disapproves.
<Ghosties> 04So
<Sumica> 00,10I cant speak for europe as i dont live there.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The economy is swaying against new IP adoption.
*Petrified_Discord invades Chrysalis' single player :3
<alexxm> wii u it allows time travel
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11public forums were originally jossed because we were already having issues keeping mod strength up with doing everything else at the time. I don't think that issue has changed in the slightest considering our discussion on that topic earlier.
<Pinkies4thWall> OMGOMGOMGOMG
<CupcakeWarrior> Everyone will be able to watch you clop :P
<cachi01> DAFUQ WIIU CAN TRAVEL IN TIME+
<Om> Browser are the keep to Mebers
<Acleps> Wow... they are making people be less and less social in real life by making it easy (nearly mandatory) to communicate with random people online...
<Tov|Christmas> They should have gotten hologram Carl Sagan to do this.
<Sumica> 00,10wii phone!
<Chrysalis> browser based? so its completely bull then
<Pinkies4thWall> That's awesome!
<GabeMoist> Regardless of Time? Nintendo has Time Lords working for them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spectation in SP?
<Meanwhile> Miibirth?
<Dken2021_> Nittany_Discord too risky, which sucks
<Vordox> Sumica: We're embracing quality and diversity, and not something like Xbox :P
<Darkts3> PC?
<Ghosties> 04Nittany is up next, are you ready?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You know why that is bad?
<CK|MoarDed> SHWEE DEE ES
<Bobeh> Dayum.
*CupcakeWarrior drools
<GabeMoist> I can play WiiU with Emperor HiroHito
<cachi01> the MIIverse and the Pro controller sound amazing
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My only point is communication.
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: Because it is shit
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But, yeah.
<Deleted_dreams> :p
<Tov|Christmas> One moa thing!
<Gamer_Luna> I got a 3DS
<Vordox> Nitt: There is? I love sometimes just spectating other games, this is for options and possibilities to do something of a more competative gaming
<Acleps> They're trying to be more like Apple
<CupcakeWarrior> The wii u is going to be SO AWESOME
<Dken2021_> breaking news, nintendo discovered the internet
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I hope this'll be up later, i gotta catch up because DOUBLE RAINBOW
<Om> I'm sure this is how most of would sound speaking a different language too.
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: why would it not transfer to the states' culture?
<Petrified_Discord> Map of the known Miiverse
<Chrysalis> one more thing
<Sumica> 00,10and :to beanounced:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because the console can have forced always-on DRM.
<sagas> prince-lemon: How do you catch updates so quickly?
<Chrysalis> jackiiiiiie
<twilight_sprinkle> miiverse=skynet
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's an excuse for it.
<RAWRity1> Not to be mean but...could they not have hired a spokesperson with a less heavy accident?
<Deleted_dreams> Nintendo 3ds... UGH MY EYES
<alexxm> game machine?
<Sumica> 00,10diffrent mindsets in gamers Dark_Horst
<Kandarihu> SaxyPretender: you'll probably find it on the internet somewhere.
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: *Walks to them* Netx time, Warning me if I heading torws a mountine.
<pikorar> Someday, they'll be able to connect the brains of families into a videogame device.
<Insert_cupc4ke> game machine for me is irrelevant
<Petrified_Discord> TVnternet
<DerpSurge> STOP TALKING AND SHOW US GAMES
<Chrysalis> family + game machine is not an equation that should ever have a solution
<FillyFlam> Dat game machine/TV relationship
<Pinkies4thWall> in effect the fam and the net
<CK|MoarDed> The relationship between the game machine and the TV doesn't NEED to be changed. You plug in the cords, the end.
<Insert_cupc4ke> just as long as it can play good games
<CK|MoarDed> :|
<sagas> Nittany_Discord: :D That will never happen.... Right guys?.... Right?
*cachi01 remembers the wii want to play wii advertises
<CrimsonPhoenix> Games is only in two days
<Dken2021_> Chrysalis lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> this is all about Wii U

<Ghosties> 04Well, you were talking about having to repeat ideas in SRS
<Meanwhile> Great
<Om> What a nracisits.
<Ghosties> 04And you didn't like that
<sagas> Now your paedophille grandfather can watch you through the TV!
<CK|MoarDed> Wow! So it's just like Windows 7!
<Meanwhile> So if you want to watch porn on the small screen
<CupcakeWarrior> You can watch porn from your video game controllers now
<Dark_Horst> why would i wanna do that?
<DerpSurge> No games? Then I'm calling it a night.
<alexxm> oh god everyone will see your porn
<Meanwhile> It plays on the big screen!

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Let me finish.
<Sumica> 00,10.....so how many housholds will make use of that function?
<Om> GilDash: Its just Nintendo.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Mario and Zelda O.O
<Ghosties> 04Go right ahead
<Pinkies4thWall> CupcakeWarrior: Mii too
<Vordox> Sumica: I will.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm listening ;A;
<RAWRity> Sumica: none
<DerpSurge> pikorar: O U STOP IT :D
<Meanwhile> Mario and Zelda, why won't they die?
<Darkts3> lol
<Chrysalis> Sumica proabbly as many as still use the balance board
<Tov|Christmas> You mean, great solution, right?
<Vordox> Miyamoto? <.<
<RAWRity> Sumica: but it'll make for cool YOutube Parties
<Darkts3> problems not programs
<CK|MoarDed> MULTIPLE PROREMS
<Gamer_Luna> GilDash: I can't understand the crap his saying :|
*CupcakeWarrior gives SuperBrony64 a Mario and a Zelda
<pikorar> I can't stop lovin' you, DerpSurge!
<Acleps> Probrems
<Vordox> Gamer_Luna: Listen better. :P
<Darkts3> we need subtitles =/
<Bronysith> Gamer_Luna: can i hug you?
<Kandarihu> Darkts3: you can't chat on the IRC though. Wait. Did he mention a built-in keyboard? Or does he still want us to draw all our text?
*SuperBrony64 plays with Mario and Zelda ^-^
<GilDash> Om: Whilst I'm not a fan, I know other people might be.
<sagas> You realize how he hasnt given a price point yet? This is gonna be fucking expensive
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sometimes for example, I'll ask to confirm a time for an interview. I get no response. I bring up an idea in the game dept. No response.
<Bronysith> Ghosties: hello
<twilight_sprinkle> wii beliete it can help!
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: probably 3. and they will bash each other'S heads in ebcasue everyone throws something else at the tv
<Lil_B> seconjd best quote by shigeru myamoto
<Vordox> sagas: LAWL!, no
<twilight_sprinkle> wii believe it enables
<RAWRity> "We believe...but we have no proof."
<Om> GilDash: I just like his accent.
<Meanwhile> sagas: I hope so, that might make it unsuccessful.
*Pinkies4thWall hugs Ghosties
<red_ony> smile smile smile
<FillyFlam> Alone together.
<CupcakeWarrior> Wii U is best money printer
<Sumica> 00,10guess i am one of the few that is asking why on this system.
<Petrified_Discord> MOAR empathy
<Chrysalis> sharing of more empathy this guyy REALLY doesnt know gaming
<Acleps> sagas: Consoles seem to be getting more and more expensive, so it's not a big surprise
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica: This is awesome
<DasPinkie> reckon the internet brower will actually have flash?
<Meanwhile> Sumica: You aren't alone.
<pikorar> I've got to go eat everybody, I'll be back!
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: it'S like giving a remote to every family member and unleashing them at primetime
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's like I'm talking to a wall or in an empty room.
*Ghosties nods
<Gamer_Luna> Bronysith Why?
<twilight_sprinkle> and then they witnessed the american Wii universe
<Chimera> http://www.nintendo.co.jp/nintendo_direct_pre_e3_2012/en/index.html
<Darkts3> Cant wait For Crysis 3 in E3
<Tov|Christmas> It's a current Gen console. Wii U should only be $300.
<Chimera> Oh Nintendo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it slows things down and causes problems like missed events.
<cachi01> together better
*Deleted_dreams scoffs at computer screen
<GilDash> Om: Well, I'm impressed he's speaking as well as he is. Gotta be tough.
<Vordox> Together is always better. <3
<CupcakeWarrior> inb4 stalking
<Petrified_Discord> Together better? Uh...you need a verb there dude :/
<cachi01> best slogan ever
<Bronysith> Gamer_Luna: nvm
<Shizuka> 13talking off the top of my head here, but i think that's a problem with authority
<Meanwhile> So...it has internet?
<sagas> Acleps: But this isnt a console! ITS A FUCKING CONSOLE ACCESSORY!
<pony_9996> Alone together?
<Shizuka> 13as in
<Chrysalis> Tov,but then you have the conotrollers
<Sumica> 00,10perhaps it's my merican thinking
<Shizuka> 13who has the authoritative answer for X at the time
<Meanwhile> WOOP DEE FUCKING DOO.
<Chrysalis> controllers*
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: eeyup.
<CK|MoarDed> If there is a way to describe Wii U, it's "overpriced iPad functionality that existed five years ago"~
*Petrified_Discord stalks CupcakeWarrior
<Bronysith> Sumica: possibler
<MahBoi777> Petrified_Discord: Lol
*CupcakeWarrior is paranoid now 0_0
<sagas> Acleps: This is getting out of hand
<Meanwhile> Jesus christ.
<LordCelestia> 0,5^^^
<XAX> alexxm: Short and average
<CK|MoarDed> *iPaid with
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, and I know what you mean
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: *sighs* " As the pony walks down into the forest, The sun was going down. If only she had wings she could fly Out of this forest and grab help. But as unicorn, she can't fly. So she's stuck in the forets." I hate to it but, I LOVE THIS BOOK!
<red_ony> I wont
<Kandarihu> Dokuso?
<GilDash> Om: There are natural born English speakers that I understand less thant him. :D
<Deleted_dreams> DSI IS OKAY
<Ghosties> 04Kinda have the same problem with Art
<alexxm> he wants your family to watch when you play with yourself
<Shizuka> 13bystander syndrome too, it's likely we're all thinking "someone else knows"
<Petrified_Discord> Ohai MahBoi777
<FillyFlam> Dat Big Brother Nintendo
<LordCelestia> 0,5See Nitt, I cant often answer your question in the podcast dept
<Ghosties> 04Exactly what Shizu just said
<CupcakeWarrior> Who is streaming this?
<Sumica> 00,10I dont know any familys that are gonna be able to make use of all this stuff
<Ghosties> 04"Someone else knows"
<MahBoi777> hey Petrified_Discord:P how are u?
<Sylandest> GilDash: try living in kentucky. The accents are atrocious, lol
<Gamer_Luna> Is getting bored,so starts to play With Irish_Pony 's Hair
<CK|MoarDed> Please don't.
<LordCelestia> 0,5because It's not my decision most of the time
<Lil_B> the WiiU IS NOT ONLY THE GAME PAD, it is A NEW CONSOLE, because it needs MORE POWER for MODERN GAMERS!
<Ghosties> 04"Someone else will handle it"
<Om> GilDash: Yeah. Try the south in america. Cant understand that at all
<Acleps> sagas: I know... PS4 might cost nearly a thousand dollars. That's getting ridiculous
<Vordox> Sumica: So?
<Sylandest> MahBoi777: howdy!
<sagas> Nitendo: The Apple of the console video gaming world!
<DasPinkie> wiiuwiiuwiiu
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That needs to stop.
<MahBoi777> hey Sylandest!
<CK|MoarDed> Please provide something else besides the Wii U for E3, please.
<Petrified_Discord> MahBoi777: Not bad. Back on the grid after visiting old people :)
<Shizuka> 13indeed
<CK|MoarDed> PLEASE.
<Ghosties> 04I agree fully
<Sylandest> MahBoi777: how are you today?
<Ghosties> 04But
<cachi01> WELCOME
<Lil_B> sagas, please never say that again :/
<Darkts3> twitty
*CupcakeWarrior applauds heavily
<Sumica> 00,10just saying Vordox
<Ghosties> 04How do you make people talk?
<Darkts3> lol
<GilDash> Om: Try the Scottish... *cough*Saturn*cough*
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: Oi! *ruffles her mane*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know people are AFK, but I'd like timely answers to things.
<Deleted_dreams> TWEETING?!
<Vordox> Sumica: There is one thing you don't think about or are missing, options and diversity is never a bad thing, it is tere to be used only if you find it intersting enough to do?
<Insert_cupc4ke> lets spam it
<DasPinkie> tweetah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know.
<cachi01> XD
<MahBoi777> Petrified_Discord: that's good
<RAWRity> I give no fucks about the 3DS. JUST TELL ME WHEN B/W 2 COME OUT IN THE US.
<Tov|Christmas> If the console is off, can I still play games on the pad?
<Om> GilDash: Never heard it before :\
<Ghosties> 04That's our problem ._.
<sagas> Lil_B: You know it's true!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02YES
<CupcakeWarrior> THANK YOU SO MUCH NINTENDO
<Ghosties> 04Negative reinforcement is bad
<DasPinkie> compreete
<Ghosties> 04But
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Japanese guy!
<Petrified_Discord> tWIItter
<cachi01> THANKS YOU
<Vordox> Sumica: Just saying "who would use it all" is like "Playing every game" or "Watching every art" or "Seeing every movie"
<Dken2021_> I know Sumica, especially when they don't know it can connect to the internet
*SuperBrony64 hugs Nintendo
<Ghosties> 04I mean
<red_ony> wow
<Meanwhile> Five bits says I don't care about anything that shows up at E3 at all.
<Bronysith> http://memegenerator.net/instance/21425350
<Ghosties> 04What else do we have?
<MahBoi777> Sylandest: I'm doin great, how about u?:)
<Shizuka> 13a third motivator is "i think i have an answer, but i don't think it's final, but everyone will think it's final"
<cachi01> THAAAANKS
<Sumica> 00,10it's reinventing the wheel and calling it the miiwheel
*CupcakeWarrior hugs Nintendo
<Vordox> Sumica. The options and diversity is never a bad thing,. Really.
<Deleted_dreams> I hate the 3DS, DSI'S FOR EVER!
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: My mane is always ruffled :)
*cachi01 marries nintendo
<DasPinkie> well that was enjoyable
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Meel?
<Sylandest> MahBoi777: tired, but happy to be free from work
<Shizuka> 13(see, trilogy month >>)
<Tov|Christmas> Well, at least the Wii U has promising online features.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02One more time :3
<Acleps> It was live?
<twilight_sprinkle> Japan ftwwww
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lack of feedback on ideas is causing the gaming dept problems.
<Pinkies4thWall> YES
<CupcakeWarrior> I cant wait till this thing comes out
<GilDash> Om: A thick Scottish accent can be nigh on impossible to understand, even in England.
<Ghosties> 04Do we maybe reassess teams?
<Pinkies4thWall> YESYESYES
*Midnight_Tempest explodes
<sagas> Acleps: If it gets that expensive, I might be willing to lay down the money and finally build my own gaming PC
<Darkts3> lol
<Insert_cupc4ke> urghhhh
<Chrysalis> Tov, really, promising, theyt all look abysmal
<MahBoi777> Sylandest: finally free lol
<cachi01> wow it was live?
<CK|MoarDed> Wow.
<Dark_Horst> everything i saw today is exactly the same stuff i coukd do with a laptop and internet
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: Well then I can do this then...*kisses neck*
<Darkts3> huh it was live
<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64 are you really /that/ in love with nintendo that you're willing to spend money on that crap?
<Dark_Horst> i dont get how that'S innovative
<Tov|Christmas> Back to A:TLA?!
<Kandarihu> It all depends on total centralization to Nintendo's servers.
<Derpyty> >_>
<Bronysith> http://memegenerator.net/instance/21425350
<Om> GilDash: Thick anything is hard to understand.
<Chrysalis> just old gen tech with a bit of a spit shine
<Bobeh> YAAAAY
<Sylandest> MahBoi777: eeyup, I am! :D
<Vordox> Sumica: There was so many new ideas into this, that has only been marked as "minor things in gaming" but they are putting more effort and visibility into it. And as for social aspect of it, it's quite a grander new change within gaming to make it more of a market ware
<Bobeh> IT LOOKS AMAZING
<MahBoi777> WOO
<CK|MoarDed> So basically Nintendo E3 will be exactly as predicted: Wii U.
<sagas> Well that was shit....
<CupcakeWarrior> Meanwhile: Dont diss the Wii U, its awesome
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Meanwhile: ;^;
<Meanwhile> CupcakeWarrior: It's spit in a bucket.
<Insert_cupc4ke> Wii U is terrible
<Vordox> Sumica: Etc etc Console console Social etc local etc no internet etc etc... :P
<cachi01> CK|MoarDed: and some games TBA
<DasPinkie> still wont play dvds
<Shizuka> 13i think wiki will be helpful here, being a document everyone edits and discusses on, so that you can say "hey i think x" at one time, but it's not taken as set in stone then and there
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: uh whats this *turns on fan for 10 secs and has her mane looking like a mess* Well, I know what it dose at lease.
<Petrified_Discord> I remember when E3 WAS the surprise. There was no pre-E3. *sighs* :/
<GilDash> Om: My point that he was easier to understand still stands.
<Shizuka> 13we have a tendency to just run with something instead of examine it to see if we can do better
<Lil_B> sagas the Price of their producs in releation to what they can do, is better then ether Apple, Microsoft or Sony
<Chrysalis> i have to agree with meanwhile on his opinion here
<DasPinkie> thats a shame
<CK|MoarDed> cachi01: Many of which STILL aren't out. Don't forget that.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02inb4 Super Mario Galaxy 3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<CupcakeWarrior> I cant believe anyone DOESNT want the Wii U
<sagas> THIS JUST IN: WII U IS A BIG FLOP!
<Pinkies4thWall> Meanwhile: y u no liek?
<Ghosties> 04As long as you can make sure that it's not finalized, that it would be in a discussion page
<Om> GilDash: I never dissagreed with you on that.
<MahBoi777> Petrified_Discord: good times
<Pinkies4thWall> inorite, SuperBrony64
<Bronysith> http://memegenerator.net/instance/21425437
<Dken2021_> at least they're taking advantage of the internet, but sadly the majority of consumers don't even know it can connect to the internet
<Kimori> I finally reached platinum status on club nintendo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And ideas can die when not followed through.
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: "Giggles" Irish,you cutie <3
<Ghosties> 04"Possible Solutions"
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: Rarity? Are you thier
<Shizuka> 13right, and would go out to the main page when ready
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Earthbound 3DS!
<Bobeh> WANT
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: <3
<cachi01> I WANT SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE 2!
<Meanwhile> Pinkies4thWall: Try because it's utterly pointless.
<Sumica> 00,10yay they watthered down the pc and internet and boxed it up all shiny and new and want to charge me for it again.
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont like the Wii so i know i wont like the Wii U... its just another gimmick that nintendo is making to get your money... and of course people will buy that crap...
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: how do you do that?
<alexxm> notice how he didn't mention what the launch games will be
<Dken2021_> SuperBrony64 in fils-aime's dreams
<Vordox> Sumica: What...?
<Meanwhile> What Sumica said.
<Bluestrom_S1> i hope they annouce a 3ds lite
<Bobeh> SuperBrony64: 3D Giygas. :O
<Om> GilDash: Just that some words sounded funy xD
<MahBoi777> cachi01: aw man I loved that game
<Vordox> Sumica: PC is NOT A FRICKING CONSOLE! IT'S A FRICKING PLATFORM
<Dark_Horst> CupcakeWarrior: there's nothing new about tat thing. it'S a notebook with internet, stuffed into different shape
<Ghosties> 04Alright, so then that means the wiki would have to be made very soon
<Pinkies4thWall> Meanwhile: alright, who is your god?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At best, we need to work on timely communication on time-sensitive problems.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sumica: Moo ;~;
<Tov|Christmas> Because we'd much rather have this long drawn out speech during the conference in front of millions of watchers. I doubt 100k saw this right now.
<Vordox> Sumica: They are NOT the same
<CK|MoarDed> Don't get me wrong, if it's cheap enough I might be interested.
<Ghosties> 04If we're really trying to get this thing going, then let's not wait
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64: Moo
<CupcakeWarrior> Dark_Horst: So? Its till going to be awesome
<Meanwhile> Pinkies4thWall: I have no God.
<CK|MoarDed> But no price point yet. So I'm not interested yet.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<sagas> Lil_B: I dont know... I feel they are targeting the inexperienced casual users with overpriced and under-powered hardware just like Apple
<Shizuka> 13similarly, an idea gets brought up, maybe a brain dump or two on details, but then we don't discuss until SURPRISE it's time for the idea to happen
<Airpuff> going to bed! Good night everypony :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>rainbow gone
<Kandarihu> Personally, I fear too much centralization. I don't have a Facebok account. I hardly ever visit Twitter. I have extensions on my Firefox to limit what Google and the producers of tracking cookies know about me. So this honestly scares me.
<GilDash> Om: He did very well at least. I can imagine how hard it would be.
<Petrified_Discord> I still have my DS Lite from launch day. Fuck yo various incarnations! :D
<cachi01> night Airpuff
<GilDash> Airpuff: Aw. :(
<Om> Airpuff: Happy tuseday!
<MahBoi777> gnight Airpuff! sleep well
<Pinkies4thWall> Meanwhile: you don't play games?
*GilDash hugs Airpuff.
<Deleted_dreams> Are we gonna watch something else?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>forgot to take a picture of the rainbow with my RD blind bag
<Dken2021_> in other news, pinkie pie graduates from loonytoon acadamy http://derpy.me/zIgFt
<Airpuff> Om: Thanks -.-
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I AM A FOOL
<Ghosties> 04Well then that's just motivation on the thinker's behalf
<Shizuka> 13then we start scrambling for details
<CupcakeWarrior> Im guessing me and SB are the only ones who like the wii u then?
<Acleps> sagas: Sony will make a console which they can make the most profit out of. They wat it has been going is that they get more and more expensive
<Midnight_Tempest> you people are all sheep... following the herd towards some new shiny thing that will most likely suck...
<Ghosties> 04That would mean they would have to dump their idea in the discussions page
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I want the Wii U now ;A;
<Om> GilDash: I know when I learned German, my accent was...Not the best xD but that was a while ago.
<Ghosties> 04Before it's time for an idea
<Lil_B> sagas all of these companys are scummy, I just feel like Nintendo is the least scummiest
<Dken2021_> Midnight_Fyre but. . .it's so shin
<Pinkies4thWall> SaxyPretender: take a pic of RD, post it link it, and call it good.
<Dken2021_> *shiny
<Chrysalis> CupcakeWarrior you two are the ones who need shipping to the men in white coats, and padded walls
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Should we start posting ideas on the forums/wiki?
<cachi01> soooooooooo now what?
<GilDash> Om: I really should try learning another language sometime...
<Dark_Horst> CupcakeWarrior: that's like taking the engine and weels from a car, putting it into a boat and saying"that'S awesome"
<Shizuka> 13which should work well
<Ghosties> 04If we're doing wiki
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hmm, might have to do that
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: No one else wants it except us D:
<Invi> SuperBrony64 timetravel in the future is technically possible ^^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, I'm interested in Wii U
<Pinkies4thWall> I''l wait
<Meanwhile> Pinkies4thWall: I'm unfamiliar with that expression so pardon me, I'm part of the glorious PC gaming master race.
<Ghosties> 04Then the wiki should be up son
<Ghosties> 04*soon
<Kandarihu> Dken2021_: that's the Acme Looniversity. Did you miss out on Tiny Toon Adventures?
*CupcakeWarrior hugs SaxyPretender
<RAWRity> Midnight_Fyre: funfact: whenever somebody calls people sheep or sheeple, they immediately lose all credibility.
<Shizuka> 13i think that's one of the biggest failures of the current forums, that all ideas are in one section
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Time travel is only possible when the Wii U comes out ;A;
<Princess_Molestia> Ran Ran Wii U!!
<Shizuka> 13things get lost
<cachi01> NINTENDO Y U MAKE ME WAIT TILL CHRISTMAS FOR WIIU!
<Dken2021_> Kandarihu it's been awhile since I watched the show ok?
<Shizuka> 13we go to comment on some past thing and everything else gets pushed down
<Meanwhile> I want the WiiU to fall and break a hip.
<Om> GilDash: Its supposably good for your brain.
<Ghosties> 04You'd still need organization for the wiki too though
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm so used to forums that I don't know how a Wiki will work for real-time discussions.
<Petrified_Discord> SuperBrony64: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2107/
<Chrysalis> cachi01 why are you waiting at all
<MahBoi777> Wii U is a time machine?? awesome
<Deleted_dreams> >:U
<Chrysalis> its terrible
<Luna> I just wonder how you will train everyone
<HatsuneMikuFan> I want the new SSB
<Shizuka> 13for the wiki, it turns into proper categories that don't care about when you commented
<cachi01> Chrysalis: NOPE IT LOOKS AWESOME
<sagas> cachi01: If you are that huped for it, you will be disappointed
<Pinkies4thWall> Meanwhile: I can see we're done here. PONIES.
<Kandarihu> Dken2021_: me too, but I still remember it.
<Dark_Horst> sooo... when'S Sumica cominf back one?
<Luna> but that's a different discussion
<Meanwhile> Pinkies4thWall: Ponies indeed.
<Dark_Horst> *on
<Sumica> 00,10You are right they are not the same. they are selling you a wattered down version of it
<Pinkies4thWall> PONIES!
<cachi01> sagas: i dont care if ithas a zelda game on it I WILL BUY IT
<GilDash> Om: Well, there we go then. I should pick it up in no time. ;)
<RaveBrony> :\
<Kandarihu> So, I'll bet if the middle of the screen weren't white, we'd be able to see the buffering circle?
<Shizuka> 13but it's mostly that everything is in one category subject to being bumped down when comments are made
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: Who likes Portal
<cachi01> sagas: except for the cd-i............
<BlueFlare> 02LOL
<red_ony> what is next?
*Pinkies4thWall hugs Sumica. Why all the hate?
<BlueFlare> 02I thought I was the only one who stalked Nintendo.co.jp XD
<CupcakeWarrior> I cant wait! :)
<Shizuka> 13i think that's a probable reason we don't do idea threads much at all
<Om> GilDash: e_e not sure if there was a joke in there.
<Sumica> 00,10hate what hate.
<Chrysalis> Sumica watered down, and covered in wool just in case you hurt yourself on a corner
<Acleps> cachi01: It looks awesome, but now you'll have the chance to find out IS it awesome. It might be useless after all...
<Pinkies4thWall> dislike?
<alexxm> honestly super smash bros is the only reason i'm intreasted in this consle
<Midnight_Tempest> well... looking up pics of the wii u and i have to say... it looks absolutely retarded... like the merging of the Wii and a DS...
<Lil_B> Well, maybe we will see a Pippin 2 by apple this year :/
<Dken2021_> alexxm me too
<Ghosties> 04Alright, well, Shizuka and Saturn can get to working on a wiki and then train us later after it's been created
<CupcakeWarrior> inb4 when I buy it, I end up only using it for the internet
<cachi01> JUST GIVE ME ZELDA :[
<sagas> cachi01: The zelda game will probably be playable without the wii u. The wii u just seems so gimmiky
<Chrysalis> seriously, people complain about drm and all that, then companies come out with crap like that as a console
<Dark_Horst> i mean, seriously. it's internet in a handheld device. i've had something like that for years already. i call it laptop
<Cottencandy_111> CottenCandy: CUPCAKE AND TEATIME!!!!!!!!!
<GilDash> Om: ... Neither am I. ;) is becoming muscle memory for replying to you. :D
<HyperMetalLugia> MY BODY IS READY
*Tov|Christmas is still salivating
<CupcakeWarrior> Chrysalis: The Wii U is NOT BAD :<
<Meanwhile> CupcakeWarrior: It is.
<cachi01> ^
<cachi01> NO IT ISNT
<Meanwhile> It is.
<Chrysalis> CupcakeWarrior i know, its terrible
<Om> GilDash: Great now I'm just going to be getting confued.
<Skylands> 10for Skylands
<cachi01> it isnt
<Ghosties> 04So, with that, I'm hoping that not only Nitt's point but the COMMUNICATION OVERSIGHT will be effectively resolved
<Om> More
<Luna> aye and a rights structure
<PNKI> its not bad im just not interesting to me
<Pinkies4thWall> Dark_Horst: Laptop is hardly handheld
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just hope for timely communication.
<CupcakeWarrior> I might camp out to buy this
<sagas> Chrysalis: No, its a console ACCESSORY. Making it even more pathetic
<Ghosties> 04^
<Ghosties> 04So then
<Chrysalis> and thats if im being generous
<Tov|Christmas> Why is the Wii U bad? *ignores answers*
<MahBoi777> CupcakeWarrior: Lol
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: DOSE ANYPONY WANT CUPCAKES OR TEA?
<Ghosties> 04What does that mean for SRS?
<Acleps> sagas: Why would they be available for older consoles? If it would be only for Wii U, Nintendo would force all Zelda fans to get a the Wii U. That's what Nintendo wants
<GilDash> Om: So am I, if it's any consolation. ;)
<Dark_Horst> PinkiePry: what, you bolt yours to the table?
<BlueFlare> 02nonono
<BlueFlare> 02for Cube
<BlueFlare> 02;3
<Lil_B> Still: The WiiI is NOT an Hand-Hels device, It is a console you connect to the TV, that has this Tablet-Thing as an Controller... there are 2 different things...
<PinkiePry> Wut?
<cachi01> Tov|Christmas: its not bad i dont know y people say its bad :S

<Pinkies4thWall> Tov|Christmas: if anything, so people can hate. that's it
<Kandarihu> What is this? Microsoft's XBOX presentation? If the black and green are an indication
<cachi01> YAY WII
<sagas> Acleps: IM TRYING TO BE OPTOMISTIC HERE!

<CupcakeWarrior> Wii U is best pony
<Skylands> 10Guy talking on the video talks like a robot, lrn2properEnglish
<Tov|Christmas> I don't even see how its hateable.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Watch X in chat.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What movies won the lottery.
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: Of course <3
<cachi01> SuperBrony64: i think u have a little prob with the capture card
<CupcakeWarrior> Ohai Wrek
<Ghosties> 04But no doubt ideas would be brought up
<cachi01> hi Wrek!
<Acleps> sagas: Oh... Well, if you ask me, I would want to get the Wii U if it turns out to be awesome, and not THAT expensive
<Ghosties> 04So then just make sure the idea is implemented in the wiki
<Ghosties> 04?
<Bronysith> um whos going to stream?
<Dken2021_> allo there Wrek
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: I guess... I'm hated...*Turns grey*

<cachi01> good thing it will be out for christmas i will just ask my mom to get it for me
*drfsupercenter runs
<Ghosties> 04Works for me
<Ponies47> nom nom nom
<Ghosties> 04Hopefully it works completely, though
<CK|MoarDed> I don't hate it. But I recognize that it's using technology that existed at least 5 years ago and am not buying into the blind notion of it being revolutionary and new.
<sagas> RAWRity: They gotta force people to buy it someway and nostalgic fanboys have deep pockets
<Ghosties> 04Alright, well
*Pinkies4thWall gives wrek a pony
<Wrek> 05sorry

<Skylands> 10drf, yep
<Ghosties> 04You're next, Wrek
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia: are you there?

<Ghosties> 04Alrighty
*sagas hugs Cottencandy_111
<CupcakeWarrior> Princess_Molestia is here? Hai there
<Tov|Christmas> The Wii remote being gimmicky seemed arguable. Wii U controller looks like a generic controller with a very useable screen.
<BlueFlare> 02Skylands, his native language is Japanese :P
<alexxm> are you ready Princess_Molestia
<Irish_Pony> http://memegenerator.net/instance/21425787 Worst...joke...ever....
<Skylands> 10BlueFlare, no duh
<junh1024-XD> Skylands do you have recording of your voice?
<Cottencandy_111> Discorded Cottencandy: Thanks?
<Skylands> 10Jun, no
<Ghosties> 04Hmm...6:40 PM...not too bad
<Dark_Horst> well, i myself woldnt need one. even if they were cheap as bananas. it's not like you could play fallout or battlefield on thaz thing
<junh1024-XD> （￣へ￣）
<Tov|Christmas> But it has gyro control so I guess that makes the WHOLE thing gimmicky
<Chrysalis> ooooh new harvest moon game
<Skylands> 10drf, proof how? It's not like HML and I can meet up and record our sexytimes
<Shizuka> 13five hours, but we're resolving things better than last time
<Princess_Molestia> Not for you Akexxm
<FlareChaser> HEY KIDS! Flare is back! :D
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: I know a worse one: What do you do with a cricket ball?

<MahBoi777> hey FlareChaser!
<Acleps> Irish_Pony: Wait... Is Equestria in Africa :O?
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: Wack it!
<Dken2021_> FlareChaser!
<Kandarihu> Wait. The stream is back?
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<cachi01> Acleps: yes it is
<Ghosties> 04But
<CupcakeWarrior> Princess_Molestia: Hi there ;)
<Ghosties> 04We still have department matters
<junh1024-XD> what if you do ( ¬‿¬)
<Dark_Horst> Tov|Christmas: doesnt gyro control kinda translate into uncomfortable positioning of army while sitting?
<Irish_Pony> GilDash: I dont get it :S
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia: are you ready now?
<Dark_Horst> *arms
<Deleted_dreams> HEALTH AND SAFETY
<Princess_Molestia> also im still very buissy with Tax, hes enjoying himself rather much.
<Cottencandy_111> Discored Cottencandy: *Pushes the cupcakes back*
<MahBoi777> who needs safety??
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: That's the point. It's a *crap* joke.
<Kandarihu> Acleps: in the South African city of Praetoria, there's a suburb named Equestria.
<CupcakeWarrior> Princess_Molestia: Well hurry up then
*MahBoi777 jumps off a building
<Acleps> cachi01: Ummm... what?
<Gamer_Luna> Princess_Molestia: Sister?Wat are you doing here again?
<GilDash> Irish_Pony: Told you I knew a worse joke. ;)
<cachi01> Acleps: yes equestria is in africa

<GilDash> Princess_Molestia: You're in and out a lot these days, your majesty.
<FlareChaser> wat
<cachi01> lol
<sagas> Knowing what you know now, how much would you be willing to pay for the Wii U?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14$200 or so
<CupcakeWarrior> GilDash: If you know what I mean
<Cottencandy_111> Discorded Cottencandy: I perfe a apple.
<Dark_Horst> sagas: an overripe banana
<cachi01> sagas: 250 - 300
<Om> GilDash: Now that had to of been a joke
<Pinkies4thWall> sagas: up to $325
<Kandarihu> cachi01: Acleps Equestria is a fictional country with the same name as a suburb of Praetoria, South Africa.
<Herp_Derp> Hai
<sagas> Dark_Horst: Sounds reasonable
<Dken2021_> sagas at least $250
<Litwick> 599 US DOLLARS
<Acleps> cachi01, Kandarihu: wow... That's strange
<Ponies47> I eould pay NOTHING! Because I'm not buying it :|
<cachi01> Kandarihu: yeah i know but i mean there is a equestria in africa
<CCCP> oh no :(

*CupcakeWarrior glomps CCCP
<Pinkies4thWall> ONE MILLION MONEY
<Gamer_Luna> CupcakeWarrior: Why does my sister always molest ponies?Whendid this start?I think it was after he trapped me in the moon.maybe?
*CCCP hugs CupcakeWarrior
<Tov|Christmas> $300 I'm expecting it to only be a scosh more powerful than the HD twins
<Meanwhile> What're we talking about?
<CK|MoarDed> More than $300 is a rip off for a new console in this economy, especially for technology that has existed this long.
<Princess_Molestia> Please stop sending me mesages for a while, my hooves are full atm.
<CupcakeWarrior> Gamer_Luna: Not sure
<MahBoi777> Pinkies4thWall: ALL the money
<Meanwhile> Is it the cost of the Wii thing?
<Ponies47> CCCP: What's wrong? :(
<GilDash> CupcakeWarrior, Om: Oh, Princess_Molestia knows what I mean. ;)
<Cottencandy_111> Discored Cottencandy: WHERE ARE THE APPLES!* Turns evenmore greyish color*

<Pinkies4thWall> sagas: why?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Someone's narrating Moonstuck. What are they going to use for my voice when they get to my answers?
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony: The group will soon be up!I'll send you the link when it is :)
*CupcakeWarrior hugs CCCP
<Acleps> CK|MoarDed: The thing they want money for, is that the technology hasn't been combine in the specific way yet

<Pinkies4thWall> ^ck

<MahBoi777> awwwww
<Acleps> cachi01: Umm... I know about lyra, and I know what a plushie is...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^-^
<CK|MoarDed> Whereas Sony is the opposite: they use cutting-edge technology, often before they've worked out the bugs. So they have their own host of problems.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02all the wub /)^3^(\
<HyperMetalLugia> lol
*CupcakeWarrior would use the lyra plushie as a cup holder
<Tov|Christmas> I just hope won't sell the Wii U for a loss like they're currently doing for the 3DS.

<CK|MoarDed> Tov|Christmas: Selling for a loss isn't necessarily the bad thing. The costs are usually made up in sales of games.

<cachi01> XDDDDDDD
<CCCP> NETFLIX HAS PONIES!
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: I wub u :3
<sagas> Pinkies4thWall: Because people are willing to pay over $250 for an untested piece of hardware. It basicly adds a touch-screen tablet to the Wii. Thats it. I feel we did the same thin with the 3DS whne they released it for $300!
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I wonder if it'd hold beer? :S
<Ponies47> NETFLIX YAAAAAY! :)

<Nittany_Discord> 11,011/3 to 1/2 fail rate.
<CK|MoarDed> sagas: Except that $300 is closer to what it's worth. Go look up the price of a Wii and an iPad, put them together, I bet you they do not cost $300 bucks total at retail.
<cachi01> Acleps: it has a hole in well u must see the pic

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They did extend warranties.
<Kandarihu> Not Chobits.
<Acleps> cachi01: Yeah, I understood from the description. My imagintaion did the rest :/
<CCCP> ive actually never seen this show!! :P
<Darkts3> what?
<Irish_Pony> nop.avi
<Litwick> What a tease XD

<Kandarihu> I don't want to see Chobits
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said the other companies didn't make shovelware
<Dark_Horst> oi... what was that?
<Cottencandy_111> Discored Cottencandy: PLEASE ANYTIME BUT LOST TAPES! IT GIVES ME NIGHTMARES!
<Pinkies4thWall> sagas: you forget that it costs money to make things like this with expensive components. that factors into the price
<CK|MoarDed> Oh god
<drfsupercenter> 03but at least most XBL Arcade titles are worth getting
<FlareChaser> DOCTOR WHOOO!
<drfsupercenter> 03unlike WiiWare
<QT_Marks> only have 2 seconds, but HEY ALL :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But now I have my third PS3 failure.
<Wrek> 05So. My point was to see if we can "update" the webchat client to show kicks and maybe even bans. this would sort alot of confusion on many points. a few that come to mind is that people will actually see kicks. and they will see the reasons. they will stop asking "why was he kicked" and so on becasue they can now read it themselves. since they aslo can see the kick reason its much easier
<Wrek> 5for the regular user to determine if mod to mod kicks are joke kicks mainly due to the message that they come with are there. so that will save some explaining to otehr users and otehr users may have an easier time aswell. and when people are kicked then? I have noticed that 90% of the time they either rejoin and go "WTF WHY WUZ I KIKKED?" due to them being too lazy to read the kick message.
<Litwick> Gabriel Iglesisas? Yes.
<Wrek> 5IIRC right now its black text on a dark grey backround so i can to a certain degree understand why some cant be bothered reading it. but if at all possible have the kick message (in white) be "you have been kicked by X [because]" then a checkbox (or something) that says "I have read my kick message" or something. and then you can hit OK and be on your way. combined with the possible future
<Darkts3> American Dad!!!
<Wrek> 5ToS and rules update. jsut something that will generally improve some of the flaws I personally find with it currently.
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64: Rosario
<Gamer_Luna> PARKS AND Rec?
<Herp_Derp> i agree with this
<CCCP> eh?

<cachi01> lol
<CupcakeWarrior> XD
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Kandarihu: What are you talking about? This is like the first time I've played this show in months
<CK|MoarDed> sagas: $300 is about right for Wii U's functionality at present.

<Irish_Pony> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> or at least just longer

<CrimsonPhoenix> oh snap American Dad
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: Why do you complain so much?

<CupcakeWarrior> Tov|Christmas: Now why would you ignore him?

<Cottencandy_111> Discored Cottencandy: I perfered Watching someone playing Portal prelude then watching this crapo.
<Deleted_dreams> o_o
<Shizuka> 13to my knowledge, we can't set lightIRC to show kicks, which is a problem
<cachi01> XD
<Shizuka> 13Iris however does things properly
<sagas> CK|MoarDed: Ill hold my judgement until I see it come out for a while and is reviewed
<Nick> but for someone who tries to try different things I find it appaling they would do that with the pro controller
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs StupidSexyCJ
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Think he's a pure realist
<Shizuka> 13two issues with making it default, one less important than the other
<Irish_Pony> XD
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11So, we need to switch chat clients again?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Didnt Phase4 says this would be easy earlier?
<CupcakeWarrior> Ow
<Shizuka> 13first is only lightIRC has the pony emotes, i for one wouldn't miss them
<LordCelestia> 0,5Or something?
<Gamer_Luna> XD

<Pinkies4thWall> Worthy hygiene lol
<twilight_sprinkle> oh its Dan!

<CCCP> FlareChaser: lol
<Bronysith> CeilingKirz: why u in my ceiling?
<FillyFlam> Hey look, it's me.
<Shizuka> 13from one i hear that making Iris default is perfectly fine, even with our spikes
<RustyMeat> I cast magic missile into the darkness
<Ghosties> 04Hmm
<pyrocatboy> dat worthy hygien
<Acleps> NO, NOT THE TROLL KING!
<Dken2021_> dem ballons
<sagas> sweater meat
<Pinkies4thWall> LOL sweater meat
<Ghosties> 04You guys are talking about the webclient that's embedded, yes?
<Shizuka> 13from another (rumor anyway) i hear that someone's very against it, for server load
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: CeilingKirz is watching you clop to ponies.
<Meanwhile> -_^
<cachi01> dem fake bewbz
<MahBoi777> lol
<BlueFlare> 02People go baww whenever someone makes something different, then they do the same when they re-use something old
<Darkts3> =/
<Irish_Pony> xD
<BlueFlare> 02lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I should give you $5 for that drawing of me despite it not being 100%. I've grown to like it.

<Darkts3> lol
<Bronysith> FlareChaser: hes watching me buck with Princess_Molestia
<CCCP> FlareChaser: you can clop to things other than ponies?
<StupidSexyCJ> Nittany_Discord: lol thank you
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Meanwhile> rofl
<Litwick> :D
<pikorar> He takes a lot of balls to the face.
<optimus-spike24> hey everypony:)
<CK|MoarDed> sagas: You can do that, just don't claim it's not about that price. $300 is probably about right. :p
<Kandarihu> Okay. I went too far with that.
<BlueFlare> 02anyhow, bbl
<Wreks_bitch> test
<Herp_Derp> ow
<Ponies47> SANDVICH! :D
<Sylandest> pikorar: i see what you did there

<cachi01> HI optimus-spike24!
<Cottencandy_111> Discorded Cottoncandy: Oh Really Discord?
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Nick> gamers nowadays
<CCCP> lol
<StupidSexyCJ> Nittany_Discord: glad you liked it
<cachi01> xd
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01StupidSexyCJ: Do you have a dA?
<CupcakeWarrior> dat kick
<red_ony> hes a brony
<Bronysith> CeilingKirz: did you say you want to be part of the vid or just support it
<Ponies47> Hey hey hey optimus-spike24 :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd link you on my Tumblr with the image.
<CCCP> who got kicked CupcakeWarrior ?
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: Who doesnt have a DA?
<Acleps> Logic.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't.
<cachi01> dat fish drive
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: That "My family is perfect" sense...XD
<pikorar> Dat psychosis.
<Herp_Derp> lol
<Litwick> Irish_Pony: me.
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: WELL GET ONE DAMNIT!
<Gamer_Luna> Fish XD
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont have a da either
<CupcakeWarrior> CCCP: Someone named himself wreks bitch
<Ghosties> 04Guys?
<Wrek> 05known issue that i jsut found by testing is that the join a cahnnel window pops up in front of the kick reason
<Pinkies4thWall> Nittany_Discord: dat answer
<Shizuka> 13if it turns out the ircops are fine with us making Iris default, that would solve our kicking problem
<Invi> klaus becomes crazy
<CCCP> CupcakeWarrior: wow
<Ghosties> 04We are talking about the embedded chat client in BronyState, yes?
<MahBoi777> lol
<Wrek> 05yes
<StupidSexyCJ> Nittany_Discord: yeah http://cj-is-the-greatest.deviantart.com/
<Shizuka> 13yeah, lightIRC is poorly designed in that regard, yes ghosties
<Cottencandy_111> Discorded Cottencandy: I'LL GET A NURSE!
<Ghosties> 04Ah, okay
<Ghosties> 04Because I'm using mIRC
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't do Art. I found use in having a Tumblr blog, though.
<Ghosties> 04And I can see kick messages :D
<Tov|Christmas> Seeing as how everyone in Nintendo took a huge salary cut, I'm guessing Nintendo doesn't have a lot of money stored away.
<CK|MoarDed> ....
<Dark_Horst> klingon wedding.... that could be interesting
<Litwick> uhhhh what
<Shizuka> 13those of us on our own clients obviously don't have the problem :3
<Nick> tbh the pro controller will have been a direct response to those 'hardcore' militants who spat their dummies out and kicked all over because they just want to keep the way they play games the same, I mean the medium is lik 40 years old now and we're still using buttons and controllers
*Gunthler follows Nittany_Discord on Tumblr
<Irish_Pony> XD
<cachi01> BANGCOK
<Shizuka> 13but we're the minority obviously
<Ghosties> 04Yeah
<Gamer_Luna> My DVART http://kinzsaw.deviantart.com/
<FillyFlam> ...That one kid sounds like Dan from Dan Vs.
<sagas> CK|MoarDed: Im just skeptical about a console accessory that costs more than the console itself.
<Wreks_bitch> conclusion: the webchat client needs some... modification
<Ghosties> 04It would be too much to ask them to get mIRC
<CeilingKirz> Wreks_bitch, change the name
<AndroidDCD> 9,1indeed. Additionally, Shizu...Iris equates to a higher server load?
<Kandarihu> The reason I hate this show is that the protagonist is a mockery of a lot of what I identify with.
<Ghosties> 04They'd have to pay
<Cottencandy_111> ???:Anypony Discored?
<cachi01> DAT PORKCHOP
<Shizuka> 13that's what i'm a bit hazy on dcd
<Irish_Pony> And to think, Im a fan of the Orioels :)
<Wrek> 05CeilingKirz: sorry
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Can't you embed something like miRC though?
<Cottencandy_111> Uh hello?
<Nick> so they got what they wanted and then they'll moan its a 360 rip off...not denying it isn't because it is but you know there's no pleasing them
<Shizuka> 13my memory is terribad, but from maker i hear that it'd be perfectly fine, from rumor i hear kabaka is strong against
<CK|MoarDed> sagas: The console is going to cost $300, not the accessory. :p
<CCCP> Kandarihu: lol
<Wreks_Slave> hello everypony
<Darkts3> lol
<Cottencandy_111> ??????????
<Nick> just reading the comments on IGN daily makes me laugh, and wanna slam my face off a wall
<CCCP> hi Wreks_Slave :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://nittany-tiger.tumblr.com/ <- see.
*Gunthler follows Nittany_Discord
<Shizuka> 13you can't embed mirc, mirc is a standalone client
<Dken2021_> snot's a red shirt, how swell
<Cottencandy_111> I'm out! PEACE!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chatzilla is fre.
<alexxm> hey Wreks__slave hows your day been
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*free
<Litwick> best impersonation of shatner
<Meanwhile> Lolwat.
<BlueFlare> 02Well it’s smart of Nintendo to have alternative ways on playing
<cachi01> dat japan
<Dark_Horst> chekov. right
<AndroidDCD> 9,1also wouldn't mind lost pony emotes, but inb4 viewer backlash
<BlueFlare> 02makes it more user friendly
<cachi01> YAY GEEKS!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not as straightforward to use as mIRC though.
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: What is with the black guy all green?
<sagas> The wii u costs more than the wii, even though it requires the wii to work
<Luna> chatzilla is just a client though?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And it required Firefox.
<Bronysith> is steve a brony?
<CCCP> awwww
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It is.
<BlueFlare> 02of*
<Meanwhile> Dat delusion.
<Luna> we are talking about the web ui right?
<CCCP> Bronysith: probably
<Shizuka> 13there's a ton of embeddable clients, i recall bronystate used mibbit at one point?, but iris is here, ponychat official, does what we need
<Gunthler> Stan is a brony
<Shizuka> 13yes luna
<RustyMeat> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Yokupony> I don't even
<Invi> Bronysith its likely
<Darkts3> =/
<cachi01> Bronysith: nah he is an otaku
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Irish_Pony: Read the caption.
<CK|MoarDed> sagas: Um, dude, the Wii U is a separate console. It's not just an accessory.
<Pinkies4thWall> :D
<red_ony> there wasnt a pony in there..not all is lost
<Meanwhile> Algebra
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Nick> yeah, but why didn't they just keep the old wii pro controller? since wiimotes will be compatible too
<hen3ry> bwahaha
<Luna> and yea we were on mibbit
<Tov|Christmas> XD
<Invi> lol
<Acleps> sagas: So wait... The Wii U is only a controller?
<Luna> in the old days
<CupcakeWarrior> Nittany_Discord: dat Maid Discord drawing
<Nick> oh wait scratch that sorry it'll be wireless controller xD
<cachi01> Bronysith: maybe an otaku but not a brny
<Luna> even chatango :P
<Sundaysmile> I'd X her Y
<Cottencandy_111> Discored Cottencandy: Back. Thing acting up with me.
<Dken2021_> Acleps no it's a system
<Shizuka> 13heard about that
<BlueFlare> 02yeah XD
<Luna> prior to thatr
<CK|MoarDed> No. Wii U is a separate console. Otherwise it couldn't do 1080p >_>
<Nick> or is the wii pro controller wireles? I dont have one since I use my GCN controller
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01StupidSexyCJ did that drawing.
<Tov|Christmas> The Wii U is Black. I'm so proud.
<Acleps> Dken2021_: Yeah, that's what I thought
<Pinkies4thWall> Acleps: no the wii u is the console. The gamepad is the controllrer
*CupcakeWarrior glomps StupidSexyCJ
<Wrek> 05one could argue that if ponychat "forces" the use of light IRC, their services are not enough
<BlueFlare> 02it's wired
<cachi01> wii u is black? awesome!
<AndroidDCD> 9,1Chatango was first, but not IRC though. Stupid DCD knew naught about chat clients.
<Cottencandy_111> ??????: COTTENCANDY STOP THIS BAD BEAVIOR! YOU'R NOT LIKE THIS!
<Dken2021_> Acleps alot of people were confused when they first revelaed it
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Shizuka> 13not so much forcing, there's always a link in the corner to swap to Iris
<CupcakeWarrior> Hawt
<CCCP> cachi01: ikr!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I opened donations for a bronyfunds outfit, I wonder if I could get the amount asked.
<sagas> CK|MoarDed: Acleps: I thought it was just a controller
<Shizuka> 13but we bring a lot of traffic, especially on pony episodes
<Acleps> Tov|Christmas: On the video it was white :O
<Ghosties> 04Yep
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Nick> right well then yeah but still why didn't they keep the old design? This new one is gonna cause flamewars extroadinairre
<Shizuka> 13and can you imagine the spike for the premiere, they're probably already panicking about it
<cachi01> Xd
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I only need $150 total.
<Litwick> Stress zits?
*Kandarihu has a dream that we will judge a console not by the color of it's shell but by the contents of it's library (and respect for the rights of it's users of course).
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Less.
<SilverSonic> Shakira's new single "WARA WARA" coming soon
*SilverSonic flees
<CCCP> Kandarihu: HAHA
<CK|MoarDed> sagas: Nope. It's a console that features a new controller. It just happens to be backwards compatible so that Wii controllers work with it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kandarihu: I know.
<Tov|Christmas> Acleps but the zombie nerd loser had a blacks Wii U Game Pad
<Gamer_Luna> I LOVE THE FISH XD
<cachi01> weeeiiiird fish
<Cottencandy_111> ???: COTTENCANDY! STOP THIS! YOU ARE NOT LIKE THIS!
*StupidSexyCJ is glomped
<Ghosties> 04Yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Back to the days of gaming when you owned what you bought.
<Meanwhile> I have a dream that Nintendo go into administration. If only.
<Shizuka> 13i vaguely recall they changed the lightIRC embed to better handle us, so despite assurances from maker that Iris should do fine, we'll want a definitive answer
<Ghosties> 04But um
<Tov|Christmas> The Wii U Game Pad had its own name, btw.
*Vordox agrees with Kandarihu
<wreks_puppet> testing Nr 2
<cachi01> Cottencandy_111: stop RPING
<CupcakeWarrior> eww
<sagas> CK|MoarDed: Are you sure?
<Wrek> 05wreks_puppet
<Ghosties> 04Even if we don't miss the pony emoticons, surely the viewers would?
<CCCP> i have a dream that Meanwhile will admit to his love
<CCCP> of
<Meanwhile> I have a dream that CCCP will get hit by a bus.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i have a dream that EA goes under as well as all call of dutie companies
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...it would cut down on emote spam
<Cottencandy_111> ????: rping?
<Acleps> Tov|Christmas: Maybe there's a black and a white version...
<CCCP> Meanwhile: :3
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: T'is a fine dream.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or at least you were treated like a human being when you bought a game.
<optimus-spike24> dat jockstrap...MY EYES!!!
<RustyMeat> lol....
<Shizuka> 13there's that too, but less spam, and honestly it would make for clearer communication to me
<CK|MoarDed> ....
<CupcakeWarrior> Meanwhile: I have dreams where you get married to Trixie
*Nick trips silversonic
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so I guess that could be an explanation to them
<CK|MoarDed> Dat son
<Kandarihu> Well, in any case, the most advanced gaming console I have (and probably ever will at this rate) is purple.
<alexxm> seems legit
<sagas> Stan has a black son...
*SilverSonic avoids trip
<Shizuka> 13kind of like skype, i have skype emotes turned off
<Nick> :3
<cachi01> Bronysith: NOOO infinity ward also makes new games besides cod!
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Sumica> 00,10emote spam is kinda infrequent as it is though
<Nick> D:
<BlueFlare> 02well, the GameCube controller was a lot like the PS2 controller and they didn't have any problems
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Meanwhile> CupcakeWarrior: dude that's creepy.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i love valve and blizzard really. they are good companies
<Darkts3> =/
<sagas> Stan has a black son named Darnell....
<Bronysith> cachi01: too bad. they are linked with cod
<pyrocatboy> Meanwhile X Trixie forever!
<Tov|Christmas> Acleps: Black controller white console. seems unlikely
<Shizuka> 13if someone does (hug) or whatever, i don't see what they see, they could be thinking something totally different than what i am (not by much but you get my point)
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: I like valve more but I do like Blizz games.
<Irish_Pony> ppppfffftttttthahahaha
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Infinity Ward has never made anything but CoD.
<CK|MoarDed> xD
<cachi01> Bronysith: yeah actually the created cod
<Skylands> 10[18:40] <junh1024-XD> what if you do ( ¬‿¬) <- (ﾉ `Д´)ﾉ
<Irish_Pony> TACOS!
<Meanwhile> Taco king is pissed.
<AndroidDCD> 9,1Saxy has a good idea
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: valve is awesome
<Darkts3> logic
<Cottencandy_111> *3 secs later* Cottencandy: wa? What was I doing?
<CupcakeWarrior> Taco King? That must be SB
<CK|MoarDed> ....
<alexxm> taco rage
<Irish_Pony> XD
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^-^
<Shizuka> 13i think some of the pony emotes are making faces or something, such that when people use them they're implying something in addition to the base text we see
<RustyMeat> WOWO
<Darkts3> oh god
<Irish_Pony> XD
<CK|MoarDed> ....
<Litwick> Oh god that pun.
<Pinkies4thWall> DAT JUICE
<Dken2021_> dat jew joke
<CupcakeWarrior> SuperBrony64: Stop beating up aliens!
<sagas> Ive seen enought hentai to see where this is going
<SuperBrony64> 11,02okie :<
<Meanwhile> Dis role reversal.
<Shizuka> 13but yeah, filing under emote spam could handle it too
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think Treyarch has made games before being stuck as a CoD dev.
<CCCP> :o
<fluttercry> 05,15For some reason, I really want to go west again, just to eat at Jack in the Box
<optimus-spike24> LOL I want to see more taco king in future episodes
<sagas> I HAVE NEEDS!
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: yeah they made the siderman games
<CCCP> :(
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: spiderman*
<Darkts3> oh god
<Pinkies4thWall> UUH
<pikorar> Hey Acleps, what time is it over there?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The movie tie-ins?
<sagas> Dat teeth grind
<Irish_Pony> xD
<cachi01> Nittany_Discord: yeah the movie videogames
<Acleps> pikorar: 2:00 AM. Why?
<Pinkies4thWall> DAT WINDOW
<SilverSonic> (ﾉ `Д´)ﾉ
<Yokupony> dat innuendo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ooh.
<sagas> Taking pride in not molesting patients
<CupcakeWarrior> dat molesting unconcious patients
<BlueFlare> 02Wii U Pro Controller looks like you mixed a PS3 and xBox 360 controller together
<Shizuka> 13it's not that it's harmful, i mean there's emote extensions for just about every client, lots do it by default
<Ghosties> 04I just don't know, I think viewers would get really pissed at the lack of pony emotes
<pikorar> Because, Acleps, what day is it over there?
<BlueFlare> 02pretty good idea if you ask me XD
<Kandarihu> fluttercry: I've only lived East of the Mississipi river all my life. So does Jack in the Box only exist in the western states?
<Dken2021_> dental plan
<Wrek> 05as for Iris. what cons does it have compared to lightIRC?
<Gamer_Luna> I just found Princess Molestia's dream job!
*Pinkies4thWall my dog licks my foot
<CCCP> O_O
<GilDash> pikorar: Monday for Acleps. Same for me. :)
<Acleps> pikorar: Well... Technically Monday...
<Yokupony> Lisa needs braces
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: Oh?
<Shizuka> 13it's marginally less user friendly, i think you have to enable the join/quit filtering
<CupcakeWarrior> Teehee, he is going to look like a nerd now
<Dken2021_> dental plan
<SilverSonic> Wara Wara is gonna be the new meme XD
<sagas> That sickly sweet scent of my fathers love with a gypsie
<Tov|Christmas> If this show had cutaways...
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Shizuka> 13it exposes more about the underlying protocol, like messages from the server
<cachi01> PAPA RAPE?
<pikorar> I thought so, Acleps, I was just curious.
<Shizuka> 13but that's useful
<Dken2021_> oh god
<Gamer_Luna> Irish_Pony:
<Saturn> 08,01i use it on other sites, and generally always switch to it when i'm using the chat embed on BS
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I remember getting messages asking for more Applejack emotes time after time again...so apparently viewers like using them.
<Ghosties> 04Is there anyway to keep the pony emotes whilst still having a client that would allow for the viewing of kick messages?
<Gamer_Luna> <3
<cachi01> xD
<Saturn> 08,01and generally i'd agree with shizuka on those points
<Wrek> 05any way to modify the default settings?
<alexxm> cachi01 is best rape
<Acleps> pikorar: Okay... You're not sure what day it is?
<Saturn> 08,01yup
<pikorar> Don't you have school, Acleps, or are you out for summer or something?
<Saturn> 08,01well, wait
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: <3
<Kandarihu> Oh come on!
<Shizuka> 13yeah it remembers your settings in a cookie
<cachi01> yay im a rape! lol
<Irish_Pony> A mosk?
<Cottencandy_111> ???:ok who never wants Discored Cottencandy again.
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: ...Isn't the text just mirrored?
<CupcakeWarrior> dat bullying
<Shizuka> 13for emotes though, no idea

<Nick> well like I said hte 360 controller is actually really nice to hold
<Pinkies4thWall> :D
<cachi01> xD
<Gamer_Luna> XD
<sagas> We have no leads so this week we'll be raiding a mosque!
<Shizuka> 13unless lightIRC changed so that kick messages weren't immediately obscured by the join window
<Acleps> pikorar: Summer holiday :). And basically noone's home today (Monday), so I can sleep as long as I wish
<Shizuka> 13which i'm not sure can be done
<Nick> but come on you can't deny that's far too similar looking to the 360 one
<Irish_Pony> Oooooooooooooooo.............
<Cottencandy_111> :0 >: (
<Nick> to be its own thing I mean
<sagas> Acleps: Lucky!
<CCCP> :(
<Kandarihu> Am I hearing the voice of Patrick Stewart or an impersonator?
<Litwick> KARMA BITCH

<Bronysith> Kandarihu: nope its stewart
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: The encoded text.
<Bronysith> hiya Michael
<Cottencandy_111> >: (
<optimus-spike24> :$
<Michael> lol american dad
<pikorar> You're so lucky, Acleps, my mom is home all the time, she's a stay at home mom, and I have 4 days until my summer.
<Pinkies4thWall> hi Bronysith
*CupcakeWarrior noms on SuperBrony64
<Acleps> sagas: Why? How's it with you?
<Cobellanez> >)
<pikorar> I'm cramming for a math test, Acleps.
*Michael hugs Bronysith
<Dken2021_> overkill
<Shizuka> 13also, kick messages aren't just for the benefit of the person getting kicked
<Shizuka> 13other people can learn from them
<FillyFlam> Dat godmoding
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia: are you almost done with him?
<CupcakeWarrior> dat voice
<cachi01> dat freaking overkil
<Shizuka> 13but i'm not sure lightIRC shows kick messages to the channel or not
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Luna> I suppose we should talk to the ponychat admins about this
<CupcakeWarrior> Princess_Molestia: Can I be next?
<Bronysith> cachi01: no kill quite like overkill
<sagas> Acleps: Im on summer break, but I couldnt sleep in a late as I wanted. Had things to do
<Luna> to see what the options are
<Meanwhile> Fatty fat fat.
<Acleps> pikorar: My mom works, and my sister's is out of the house often.
<alexxm> is the fat kid a young peter griffin
<Kandarihu> Just how much hate and ridicule can be crammed into this show? This is, like, the polar opposite of MLP
<Bronysith> ITS DAN!!!
<BlueFlare> 02well, you don’t want to sacrifice comfort and functionality to say it's your own thing
<CCCP> he has a Trixie toy
<Acleps> sagas: I have nothing to do for the first 2 weeks :).
<RustyMeat> nice
<Vordox> Le wuut?
<Cottencandy_111> ????:DISCORD! WHERE YOU MESSING US PONIES AGAIN!?!?!?!?!
<Shizuka> 13i think losing the emotes would be similar to us locking the side rooms, a short period of outrageous outrage because omfg it's different, then people see it's not so bad and are fine with it
<CK|MoarDed> ELVISH
<cachi01> the guy over there looks like trixie
<Pinkies4thWall> RAPE
<Bronysith> CK|MoarDed: i need to learn to speak elvish and the ancient language
<Wrek> 05i think so too
<Kandarihu> -_(\(\(\(\(\(\(\(\(\
<sagas> Acleps: You lucky SOB. I have practice four days a week

*SuperBrony64 is nommed on O.O
<Sylandest> "oh god, I want to hit you!" :D
<Ghosties> 04I take it we're not the only ones that use pony emotes in chat clients
<Litwick> I get stress zits as well.
<Michael> omg
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Sorta like how the outrage of Youtube and Facebook were. XD
<sagas> Litwick: Most people do
<CCCP> lol
<Acleps> pikorar: What do you have on the test?
<Cottencandy_111> DID YOU MESS WITH COTTENCANDY?!?!?!?! DISORD!
<CK|MoarDed> ....xD
<CupcakeWarrior> So I just looked in the mirror and I found a bunch of gre hairs O_O
<Wrek> 05aye
<CupcakeWarrior> grey*
<Acleps> sagas: What practise :O?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Cottencandy_111, calm down and cut it out with the allcaps
<cachi01> better than sex X
<GilDash> pikorar: Cram harder! ;)
<Shizuka> 13it'd be a change, it'd cause some OMFG I'M UNSUBSCRIBING FOREVER, but they'll be back
<Cottencandy_111> ........ k.
<Ghosties> 04We're not the only brony site or brony chat that uses pony emotes...are we?
<Litwick> TIOTE
<RustyMeat> what.
<CCCP> O_O
<cachi01> tio
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know.
<Vordox> TIOTE
<sagas> Acleps: I play highschool football. I have practice 4 days a week
<Wrek> 05dunno
<RustyMeat> ...
<Meanwhile> Dat back.
<Shizuka> 13for chat we could possibly be
<Irish_Pony> xD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Haha
<cachi01> XD
<alexxm> dat alien biolgy
<Cottencandy_111> Cottencandy: So what did I miss?
<Ghosties> 04Because if we're the only one that uses that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm thinking if BronyTV does.
<BlueFlare> 02tbh I don't think you could make shape for a controller that's more comfortable in the hand
<cachi01> xd
<Kandarihu> Okay. That was funny
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh they're going to Bronycon
<Shizuka> 13reddit uses pony emotes, something of a metagame out in the other subreddits
<Ghosties> 04I would be against getting rid of pony emots
<Acleps> sagas: Sounds tough... :/
<Ghosties> 04And just let people rage over OMG WHY KICK?
<Sundaysmile> lol
<CK|MoarDed> ....wat
<BlueFlare> 02a shape*
<Irish_Pony> xD
<pikorar> Acleps: Standard deviance, arithmatic mean of a frequency distribution, making box and whisker charts out of normal distrubution graphs... You know, every day stuff.
<CCCP> ...
<Saturn> 08,01okay, so apparently, Iris can use grphical emoticons
<Tov|Christmas> Q is going be at Bronycon
<Darkts3> lol
<Dken2021_> neckbeards everywhere!
<Ghosties> 04SUGGESTION
<Saturn> 08,01but we may need to get maker to put that in on the server
<sagas> Acleps: It can be, but I enjoy the sport. Helps keep me in shape.
<Sundaysmile> LMAO
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tov|Christmas, of course
<Darkts3> oh god
<Vordox> LOL
<Gamer_Luna> I might go to BronyCon :)
<CK|MoarDed> XD
<Ghosties> 04Bring pony emotes over to Iris
<Shizuka> 13for me, emotes aren't really our core engagement though, the awesome chat is, and that stream box over there
<Vordox> Reference
<Ghosties> 04AND
<CK|MoarDed> Dem agents
<CrimsonPhoenix> He's making a documantary of it
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Ghosties> 04have kick messages
<Acleps> pikorar: Everyday stuff I've never heard of :). I can't really help you out then...
<sagas> Not even to watch!
<Shizuka> 13with time i think they'd get over it but that's me
<CrimsonPhoenix> Documentary**
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat BronyCon
<GilDash> pikorar: Crap. I used to know all of that. Still would if I had the formula written down.
<Michael> lulz
<Invi> xD moulder and scully
<StupidSexyCJ> aww not even to watch?
<pikorar> GilDash, you're going to make it so difficult to study.
<Meanwhile> This guy.
<Ghosties> 04I'd really like to keep it because it's strictly BronyState for now, unless someone else uses it
<Darkts3> probing is magic
<Sylandest> pikorar: It is her specialty. You've only just begun :D
<alexxm> kurt is best ex
<GilDash> pikorar: I don't see how...
<Irish_Pony> I would like to Irish up my drink
<Acleps> sagas: Yeah, sports are fun :)
<cachi01> XD
<CeilingKirz> 8,6there'd be an issue at first, then another at the start of s3, but everyone would get over it in time
<sagas> Acleps: So what do you have to do in 2 weeks?
<pikorar> Well GilDash, I know them like the back of my hand, but I also have to explain them in a "statistical manner" so I have to understand them in depth.
<Ghosties> 04I'm just saying
<Ghosties> 04Why not have both?
<Shizuka> 13if we can work out to keep it in iris sure
*GilDash hoofs Irish_Pony a bottle of whisky.
<Ghosties> 04Best of both worlds
<CupcakeWarrior> dat debate
<pikorar> His, Sylandest, his.
<Meanwhile> Luke Skywalker vs Frodo. Frodo is toast.
<Shizuka> 13but not the end of the world if it ends up not being able to come along
<sagas> Im gonna have to go with Star Wars on this one
<Dken2021_> this debate is a loss cause
<FillyFlam> ^
<CK|MoarDed> wat
*Nittany_Discord 11,01drinks GilDash
<Irish_Pony> xD
<CK|MoarDed> Dat joke
<Irish_Pony> Nittany_Discord: O_O
<GilDash> pikorar: Yeah, I did know all of that a long time ago. I still don't see how that means I'm distracting you.
<RustyMeat> lol...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dang
<CCCP> :o
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Hey! It smells in here!
<alexxm> nerd rage
<Michael> omg
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Acleps> sagas: Probably some work on a video. I'm not sure tho...
<cachi01> :O
<Yokupony> you monster....
<RustyMeat> DAT SPIKE
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Ghosties> 04But we'd really switch to a different chat client so people wouldn't be like OMG WHY WUZ I KICKED?
<CupcakeWarrior> ded
<Meanwhile> Star Wars kid.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It depends on what's better in the end.
<Om> GilDash: You were consumed
<Vordox> STAR WARS KID
<Michael> zummmm
<Saturn> 08,01i think kick messages are more important than emoticons
<CK|MoarDed> LOL
<optimus-spike24> lol
<pikorar> GilDash... The quote "cram harder" doesn't make it easy for my concentration.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Obvious reference is obvious
<CCCP> wow
<Gamer_Luna> XD
<Ghosties> 04We'd get rid of something unique to us...?
<CupcakeWarrior> Now if only that as funny
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Tov|Christmas> w/e we have the Laser disk untouched version on Piratebay
<Ghosties> 04Just so we could appease some angry viewers?
<Ghosties> 04Really?
<pikorar> But I do enjoy it, GilDash.
<GilDash> pikorar: Cram faster then!
<sagas> Acleps: Oh interesting. What sorta video?
<pikorar> No difference, GilDash.
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Saturn> 08,01i'ts not just about angry viewers, though
<cachi01> :o
<GilDash> pikorar: Cram deeper?
<CK|MoarDed> wat
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11No, it's so we don't have to worry about stirring drama in the chat.
<Michael> da ring
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep
<Ghosties> 04What do you mean?
<sagas> Damn1
<Meanwhile> rofl
<SaxyPretender> 0,14people see why someone else was kicked
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Dken2021_> what a nerd
<pikorar> GilDash! Please!
<Wrek> 05its not jsut about the angry few
<BlueFlare> 02!ping
<Yokupony> pwne
<Shizuka> 13i assume otakon uses his own client, but consider someone getting kicked by the autospam
<drfsupercenter> !pong
<SaxyPretender> 0,14they learn not to do that
<Invi> lol
<Yokupony> pwned*
<Darkts3> haha
<Saturn> 08,01it's about our responsibility to being open with our users
<GilDash> pikorar: What? It's good advice!
<cachi01> frodo wannabe lol
<pikorar> (I love it when you talk like that, GilDash)
<Ghosties> 04...you're not explaining though :I
<AndroidDCD> 9,1let's just agree to looking into the possibility of porting the emotes over to Iris
<Ghosties> 04Other than a few angry users
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Someone gets kicked. They con't see why. The come in, bitch up a storm and cause issues, and suddenly we have to ban them because they don't get a kick message.
<CCCP> pikorar: o_(\
<FillyFlam> Dat Whitehorse Comics.
<StupidSexyCJ> dat heartless
<Shizuka> 13if they can't see it, it just gets worse, perpetuates that hyper strict jerk ness we mentioned last allstaff
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Tov|Christmas> WMD?
<Saturn> 08,01yeah
<LordCelestia> 0,5I could care less about the emoticons imo
<Ghosties> 04Ah, okay
<Meanwhile> Smoooth
<CCCP> WMD?
<Ghosties> 04That makes sense then
<Princess_Molestia> Ok, who wanys a pice of me now?
<GilDash> pikorar: That's what I'm here for, baby. ;)
<Saturn> 08,01plus, if they don't know what they were kicked for, they don't konw not to do it again
<Ghosties> 04But still
<Irish_Pony> LMAO
<CupcakeWarrior> Princess_MolestiaL ME
<Pinkies4thWall> WMD?
<RustyMeat> son now we are a family again
<Ghosties> 04I don't want to get rid of the pony emotes
<Darkts3> me possibly
<Saturn> 08,01which is unfair on them if they then get banned
<Acleps> sagas: A video with a fighting scene. It's kinda hard to explain the story, but basically someone steals a person's item, and he fiights them and gets it back
<Shizuka> 13and @silverscreen, you can't solve that by just telling them before the kick, the message is gone after the kick
<PinkieLovesMe> lol
<CeilingKirz> like Saturn said though, the more important thing is them seeing why they were kicked, not the emotes
<cachi01> and de end
<Ghosties> 04They're unique to us :O
<cachi01> lol
<Bronysith> Princess_Molestia: me please ive been waiting my love
<Wrek> 05not only that. kick messages arent even shown in chat. so OTHER users may go "hey why did dat user get kicked? i like him" focrign me to explain why
<Tov|Christmas> 6/10 America Dad got a lot better after Season 1.
<Gamer_Luna> has fallen asleep on Irish_Pony
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: That sounds kinda desperate.
<Shizuka> 13^
<LordCelestia> 0,5^
<CCCP> it actually did Tov|Christmas
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: I AM!!!
<Ghosties> 04I get all that guys
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: <3
<Princess_Molestia> Ive go an idea
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: Oh well ok then.
<Ghosties> 04But maybe I'm just the only person here that likes the pony emotes
<Wrek> 05ok just makign sure ghosties
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Drake10) 11WB10»11•. 10- As long as you clean up after him then sure
<Ghosties> 04I mean hell
<Pinkies4thWall> b y e b y e
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
<FillyFlam> That cop at the end makes my day.
<BlueFlare> 02sigh
<CCCP> bye Pinkies4thWall
<Invi> who is actually that cop ath the end of each episode?
<sagas> Acleps: So a beat-em up? Please do share if you decide to make it!
<Ghosties> 04It's really neat, we don't know of anyone else that uses them
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kick messages can't be seen in our embed.
<Herp_Derp> another one?
<Dken2021_> seeya Pinkies4thWall
<Ghosties> 04At least not in chat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can see them.
<Michael> lol dat molestia queue
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: we all like the emotes, i'm guessing. but there are more important things.
<FillyFlam> He's the friend of the world~
<Acleps> sagas: If I see you I will :)
<AndroidDCD> 9,1let's look into porting them. I have a gut feeling it's feasible
<BlueFlare> 02I only got 8 minutes into that video and now it won't play :@
<Wrek> 05i like them to, but id rather have the kick messages
<Ghosties> 04More important than ponies? PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT
<Sumica> 00,10I like them as well ghosties.
<CCCP> umm???
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I know for a fact that people bugged me about them before.
<Wrek> 05agree with DCD
<Pinkies4thWall> oh no CCCP and Dken2021_ i'm talking to the guy in the blue jacket
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11I like them, but I prefer avoiding bans and drama over keeping them.
<Ghosties> 04So
<SuperBrony64> 11,02But imo, I find them annoying.
<Dken2021_> Pinkies4thWall oh
<GilDash> Princess_Molestia: Can I have a pic of you? ;)
<CCCP> Pinkies4thWall: ohhh!
<Ghosties> 04It seems that users do like pony emotes
<Sumica> 00,10I dont see why we dont have an AJ one when other sites do though
<sagas> Acleps: Ill hold you to it!
<Invi> Michael a molestia queue. srsly?
<Saturn> 08,01plus, if any of *us* are using the chat embed (which i'm certain some of us to), we can't see why people are kicked
<Ghosties> 04But then people want kick messages shown
<Ghosties> 04Maybe
<Acleps> sagas: It will have some jokes that you probably won't understand tho, but it'll probably ok
<Gamer_Luna> "Wipes eyes"What are we watching next?
<Ghosties> 04We should ask the users?
<Wrek> 05<Sumica> I dont see why we dont have an AJ one when other sites do though
<Princess_Molestia> Look me up, Gildash.
<Om> GilDash: You could use google. xD
*Pinkies4thWall gives Dken2021_ and CCCP each a muffin
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sumica:...MakerDusk told me they were going to add them months ago...
<Wrek> 05so others do use them
<Sumica> 00,10but I have to say the logistics are more important then the emotes
<LordCelestia> 0,5I cant even see emotes
<CCCP> i dont want it
<Pinkies4thWall> :O
<LordCelestia> 0,5cause of mIRC
*Dken2021_ noms muffin <3
<Saturn> 08,01what Sumica said
<Sumica> 00,10yeah i have seen them all over the place
<LordCelestia> 0,5so honestly I don't care what happens to emotes
<GilDash> Om, Princess_Molestia: Aw, no fun. :(
*CCCP nomz Pinkies4thWall instead
*Pinkies4thWall gives Dken2021_ CCCP's muffin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't see emotes either.
<Michael> Invi: yup
<sagas> Acleps: Ha well Im sure you can explain them if I dont! :D
<HyperMetalLugia> !ping
<drfsupercenter> !pong
<AndroidDCD> 9,1 they'd obviously choose the emotes though
<Pinkies4thWall> NOOO-
<Shizuka> 13like i said, it's not our core engagement, if we can keep emotes then great, but if not, we're gaining more important things
<Ghosties> 04Maybe we should ask the users in a poll? Like "Which do you prefer more? Pony emotes, or viewable kick messages?" And whoever has the most votes gets the win?
<LordCelestia> 0,5^yeah
<Dken2021_> double the noms!
*Pinkies4thWall breaks
<LordCelestia> 0,5wqhat DCD says
<Acleps> sagas: Yup :)
<LordCelestia> 0,5They wont care about whats obviously more important
<Shizuka> 13that... wouldn't be much of a contest ghosties, people don't care about people getting kicked, unless it's them
<Gamer_Luna> Princess_Molestia: Sister,whenand why did you start molesting?
<CCCP> :o
<Saturn> 08,01Ghosties: honestly, i think at this point you're taking you're beating a dead horse here because you personally like them
<Kandarihu> Could we please just watch some Dr Who?
<CeilingKirz> Ghosties, so the poll would be "do you like pictures" vs "do you give a shit why that random guy was kicked"
<Saturn> 08,01that's just how it seems to me; i may be wrong
<Ghosties> 04It's an adaquate polling
<sagas> Gamer_Luna: Oh no not again!
<Acleps> pikorar: Wait... did you say your summer vacation starts in 4 days?
<Gamer_Luna> PARKS AND REC,PLEASE?
<Derpy_Hooves> Superbrony64: I HAVE AN IDEA
<Luna> no need for a poll imho
<Ghosties> 04"Would you rather keep pictures, or find out why your friend was kicked by a mod"
<Sumica> 00,10Caramel will rage at this but alot of the fanfiction sites use the emotes for comments areas
<Princess_Molestia> Please no messages now.
<AndroidDCD> 9,1let's agree to this. Let's cross that bridge when we get to it. If porting is doable, we would have discussed emotes vs. messsages in vain
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Only one defense for emotes: It's a pony touch to the chat.
<CCCP> Just CHOOSE ONE ALREADY!
<Ghosties> 04^
<Shizuka> 13Ghosties: it's easier to rage at us than be informed
<SuperBrony64> 11,02DECISIONS
<Kandarihu> Doctor Who please!
<Irish_Pony> SuperBrony64: Can I has request?
<drfsupercenter> 03well brb reboot
<Radu> Decisions everywhere...
<Derpy_Hooves> superbrony64: you should start from episode 1 and keep going
<Caramel> I'd only rage at it if you were suggesting I start going to these fanfic sites
<sagas> COMMUNITY please?
<CCCP> eh
<Darkts3> yes
<Wrek> 05ok
<Wrek> 05so
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Irish_Pony: Yes? :3
<cachi01> lol bush
<pikorar> Yes, Acleps. I have tomorrow, when I take my math test, then I have my Programming I exam, then after that, my Engineering I exam, then I have to go to school for some stupid reason and then I'm free.
<Dan_> omg american dad!
<Acheron187> some american dad ehh
<Wrek> 05no more about the emotes vs kicks
<prince-lemon> Could set up your kick alias to send the user the kick message in a /msg
<Dan_> I havent watched this in years
<prince-lemon> Instead of changing anything in the chat
<Ghosties> 04My only thing is that I just don't like the idea of getting rid of the emotes but if it means for better efficiency in the chat by switching over to a different client, then so be it
<Ghosties> 04But
<Wrek> 05lets put in the log that if portign is doable we port.
<Ghosties> 04If we can do both
<Dken2021_> still no flying cars :(
<Shizuka> 13so resolved, we will attempt to switch default chat embed to iris, and attempt to port emotes
<Ghosties> 04Then let's do both
<CCCP> this isn't that old Dan_
<HyperMetalLugia> Wii need U
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Acleps> pikorar: Isn't 4 days kinda....random?
<Gamer_Luna> Snuggles closely to Irish_Pony since his my comfy pillow <3
<Irish_Pony> SuperBrony64: Episode 7
<Sumica> 00,10I kinda see the poll being stacked in favor of the emotes, most cause the only people that will anser it are the regulars and they are the ones that will know why some one was kicked
*Michael wants his flying car
<XAX> lolol
<Dan_> by years I mean 2 years CCCP :)
<Irish_Pony> SuperBrony64: :3
<Ghosties> 04I only said the poll because then the viewers could decide
<CCCP> Dan_: oh
<Luna> Anything else for Wrek's list?
<Kandarihu> We come to this site as a fan of a show about love and tolerance. So we watch a show about hate and ridicule.
<Ghosties> 04I figure they'd like to do more interactive stuff
<Irish_Pony> Gamer_Luna: <3
<Saturn> 08,01the viewers don't know what's good for them
<Meanwhile> Ikr Kandarihu.
<LordCelestia> 0,5But Ty
<pikorar> How is it random Acleps? I would have 5 days but I'm exempt from my math exam. Well I will be if I can pass this final math test.
<AndroidDCD> 9,1we want the whole chat to see why though. Still: bridge, cross later.
<Drake> 04ohai HML

<Michael> hai Biglaw
<Biglaw> Everypony*
<CCCP> :O
<optimus-spike24> pillow gun seems legit
<HyperMetalLugia> My last Sony console was the PS2 as it actually had a huge selection of games for everyone ;D
<Ghosties> 04I won't deny that...
<SirSilverscreen> 1,11Ghosties, function and quality come over design and special effects. If we have to get rid of the emotes to allow us to mod better, the emotes are going.
<cachi01> 200
<Acleps> pikorar: Well... school ends here on friday or saturday... ALWAYS.
<Sumica> 00,10sad but true

<Pinkies4thWall> Pillow gun! IT SHOOTS PILLOWS!
<LordCelestia> 0,5I mean for our own decisions
<pikorar> Well Acleps, we're different, and we don't have school on Saturdays.
<Tov|Christmas> Man, the recent season of Family Guy was best season since the reboot. The dog was no longer insufferable and they toned down the Meg bashing.
<Drake> 04Ratchet and Clank, Kingdom Hearts...
<LordCelestia> 0,5But ill take this to SRS
<HyperMetalLugia> Yesssss
<Ghosties> 04Next is departments
<HyperMetalLugia> Jak and Daxter ftw

<Sylandest> oooooh
<Drake> 04XD
<Kandarihu> Tov|Christmas: did they tone down the Christian bashing?
<Sylandest> burn
<Ghosties> 04Lit is up first
<pikorar> And Acleps, this is an exam week, it's different because you can be exempt from some of your exams.
<Ghosties> 04With...
<Ghosties> 041. Chance to write articles on things such as reviews, news, opinions, really anything so that the Lit Team is doing more than newsletters and FAQ rewrites
<CCCP> Tov|Christmas: i still really dont like the new Family guy at all
<Irish_Pony> xD

<Sylandest> Dark_Horst: my brain just exploded from your sentence

<Kandarihu> Was there any talk about how when Bin Laden was killed by a Navy Seal Team, Obama took all the credit, and his supporters were making it out like it was some hugely difficult decision and a courageous move for him to say "go"?
<Meanwhile> That's racist.
<Dan_> hello DeathStar :)
<alexxm> hey DeathStar hows your day been
<CK|MoarDed> LOL

<Darkts3> =/
<fluttercry> 05,15Alright. So things I've already come up with are having a point/counterpoint section, where two poeple can talk about their opinion on some controversial topic in the fandom. Also Slurry mentioned this but reviews of movies we watch would also be something that viewers could look forward too each week. Lastly, having people just write about something they like or dislike about the show
<fluttercry> 5,15or the fandom and having a place to talk about it.
<Irish_Pony> xD
<Meanwhile> Dat mirror.

<Meanwhile> Smells like peppermint.
<Michael> dat drunk bush
<Shizuka> 13but having, say, a page for op-eds, where it's made from a category of posts, *should* be doable

<Saturn> 08,01how many BS-ers will we have there?
<BionicPony> Blaze allow me to offer my services

*GilDash grabs BlazeAngel's beard.
<Ascendant> I liked the setting for Branagh's version
<CeilingKirz> from the mod side, we've done hugs, noms, glomps, fruit, and maid, but nothing beyond basic fun
<AppleEric> Dken2021: very.
<DeathStar> Miss_Rainbow: you don't pick the mods do
<Ascendant> the castle itself was such a troll

<Kosoveon> to troll or not to troll, that is the question
*Kosoveon shot
