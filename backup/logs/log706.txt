<otakon> 75/25 is NOT fair
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<likeaboss> DEAL!
<Maid_RainBow> 75/25 Not fair
<DerpyMuffins> Green=Evil
<CrimsonPhoenix> 60/40 is more fair
<otakon> Fuck you Flim and Flam
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> 50/50 is best deal.
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: 50/50 is fair
<DerpyMuffins> 99/1 is fair
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: on the other hand, they couldve just taken over the business entirely if they wanted to
<DaringDerpy> they would still earn more than with their constant supply shortages
<CrimsonPhoenix> of course that's comprimising deal
<sub06905> 100/100 is best
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: true
<Maid_RainBow> Flim and Flam are swindlers
<DaringDerpy> and had no work at all
<DerpyMuffins> Dat hard work
<Maid_RainBow> Big mac is best colt
<DaringDerpy> Maid_RainBow: how are they swindlers?
<otakon> lol
<otakon> dat poor RD

<CrimsonPhoenix> Is this some kind of cruel joke?
<TheOtherOne> did you know , the ponies ran human civilization to extinction
<DerpyMuffins> Dat RD
<likeaboss> poor RD
<sonicandmario85> XD
<DerpyMuffins> RD wants to get drunk
<Maid_RainBow> DaringDerpy : they are trying to swindlel there way into ponyville via cider and 75/25 issent fair deal
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DerpyMuffins: :D
<DerpyMuffins> Like I used to
<likeaboss> dat apple bloom
<sub06905> RD has drinking problem
<DerpyMuffins> Ditto
<Maid_RainBow> dat FACE
<likeaboss> lolz
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Dat face :D
<DaringDerpy> Maid_RainBow: their machine does all the work, so why should the apples get more?
<likeaboss> dat pony face
<superretroworld> saw adventure time today, it was so stupid
<sonicandmario85> DerpyMuffins:if it was alcholhol they wouldent allow it in the show remember kids watch this too
<twilight_sprinkle> Maid_RainBow: they make it a lot faster though, and its good, so they could take over if they wanted to
<sub06905> 25min...
<Saturn> 08,01is it tabitha who does Granny Smith too?
<sub06905> dammit AB
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Saturn: Yep.

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Think so.
<otakon> What's a matter Granny McFly...SCOOTALOO?
<likeaboss> oh shit its on
<DaringDerpy> if ponyville weren'T dominated by old, established business nobility, but were a free market, they had every right to sell there
<DerpyMuffins> otakon: :D
<otakon> Saturn: yeah she voices Granny, Rarity AND Luna...how I love her voice acting it's awesome
<likeaboss> dat face
<Maid_RainBow> i agree the can have a bigger cut but 60/40 seems a better deal because the apples do all the work making the apples
<otakon> yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, indeed
<otakon> exactly
<DerpyMuffins> 99/1 is best deal
<likeaboss> dat music
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, tabitha also does Mrs Cake
<otakon> it takes longer to GROW the apples and more work at that then to process them
<twilight_sprinkle> 99.9/0.1 is better
<CrimsonPhoenix> FAITHFUL FARMER
<Saturn> 08,01ATTENTION DUELLISTS!
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: like I said I love her voice work in this
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<TheOtherOne> i got the strangest boner right now
<DerpyMuffins> 100/0 is better twilight_sprinkle
<likeaboss> ooooh nooo
<DaringDerpy> the end of the story: ponyville will continue to have supply shortages, nothing has improved, but the apple cartel still gets all of the profits
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh hai

<SirGanjalf> Anyway, she got better and revived a bit.
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> the horse guy is Words Worth
<Phase4> interesting, never seen those
<XylemTube> Oh mai
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> Words Worth is kind of...mature
<Sumica> 00,10is it time for the pony ep of FMP again?
<Phase4> dem optics
<Phase4> huh, they're doing glass fibers
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Sumica> 00,10this one is kinda cool
<Phase4> thoughth quatz was still the higher end stuff
<BroHoof> sup everyone!
<SirGanjalf> woah
<Phase4> ohai BroHoof
<AJIsAwesome|Groucho> Hi, BroHoof. :)
<Sumica> 00,10light travels faster through expensive firber optice cable.
<BroHoof> is dat how it's made o.o
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> oic
<DoombringerZero> http://i.imgur.com/gMKK7.jpg

<valoreins> oha bronystate :)
<valoreins> ohai*
<BroHoof> hey valoreins
<Phase4> thats actually the biggest benefit, zero interference
<Phase4> very near zero anyway
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> And now you know and knowing is half the battle. G.I.JOE!!!!
<Sumica> 00,10you should see how much they are installing at work
<Moopy> Not unless if you use the skyrim shout to
<Phase4> Sumica, in volume or in cost?
<Ordinalthrone> also, copper is now worth enough to melt down and sell if you want to replace your copper cables with fibre optics, and you make a profit
<Sumica> 00,10volume
<Phase4> yeah, coppers a bit expencive. its basicly the conductor of choice
<Sumica> 00,10they have 3 pipes in the subbasment that they just put in
<Sumica> 00,10runs the whole lingth of the place
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> i bet Vegas has tons of fiber optic
<Phase4> wow, where do you work
<Phase4> that is a lot of bandwidth
<Sumica> 00,10Venitian
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> that is a pretty casino
<Sumica> 00,10but the sands expo is part of us
<Phase4> big hotel?
<Sumica> 00,10as is the plazzo
<Sumica> 00,1047 floors
<Phase4> that counts as big
<Sumica> 00,10the sands expo has all kinds of tech shows
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> all the strip casinos are big
<Sumica> 00,10like CES
<MadSurge> Phase4: ah, so that's why scavengers always try to steal copper cables from abandoned buildings?
<Phase4> MadSurge, yeah, they're worth a fortune
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> lolz, there is an NPC in GW2 named Apple Jack selling apples at an apple stand
<Phase4> i'm suprised you dont hear of transformers being stolen
<Sumica> 00,10the voltage tends to keep peole out
<Phase4> true, but they still manage to steal power cabling anyway
<Sumica> 00,10but we hear about it all the time people going to turn on there AC in the summer only to find people have gutted it
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> its easier to strip trailer parks of their copper wires
<Sumica> 00,10and new homes haveing all the wireing stolen from them
<Phase4> dat sheet
<Sumica> 00,10this is kinda cool
<Kencolt> Okay, maybe we've gone too far in saying kida shows and adult shows aren't that different-- or movies. http://now.msn.com/paranormal-activity-4-accidentally-shown-to-kids-instead-of-madagascar-3
<Sumica> 00,10braveman
<Sumica> 00,10working barehaded with that
<Phase4> electrical cabling in the street is actually aluminium, its almost as conductive as copper, more weather resistant and crystaline. over time copper would thin and sag, aluminium doesnt
<Moopy> heh valve
<Phase4> plus a lot lighter, easier to make the poles
<Phase4> inb4 poni

*oni_link wants to get to a convention
<AJIsAwesome> I want to go to a majot convention.
<AJIsAwesome> *major
<oni_link> yay
<Socks> I've never been to a convention :'(
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks for the stream, Sumica. :)
<oni_link> Socks: me neither
<Kencolt> I've been to more than a few-- three Worldcons, used to hit the ATlanta cons and MAgnum Opus Con regularly... last one I was able to go to was a Dragoncon 5 years ago... I miss thise days,.
<Socks> Was planning to go to the Doctor Who experiance in cardiff but ye gods that was expesive!
<Sumica> 00,10and no one notices better version =p
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> i do
<AJIsAwesome> I did. :3
<oni_link> Sumica: i noticed it was longer
<Sumica> 00,10needs bacon and apple jack though so not sure if i like it
<oni_link> and thanks for streaming
<Sumica> 00,10might have to stick to old one
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I would like to go to comic-con and dragon-con this next year
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Thanks for streaming Sumica :3
<valoreins|Work> will be stuck in my own country that has no pony convention
<oni_link> I want to try to get to comic-con, e3 and at least one pony related convention
<AJIsAwesome> Have some music. :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bqTbvYZvrM&feature=relmfu
<Kencolt> Dragon Con-- the last time I went-- was SO INSANELY CROWDED...
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> comic-con was fun this year but crazy without any friends
<Socks> Not sure how I would do at a proper con as a friendless misanthrope who hates crowds :P
<MadSurge> Socks: I did well :D
<Phase4> Sumica, i just missed better version but i'd say stick with bacon and applejack
<Sumica> 00,10oi Phase4 still around?
<Kencolt> Socks: Lurk around the various video rooms and the dealer's tables.
<Phase4> Sumica, nicely timed /)
<Sumica> 00,10take that as a yes
<Sumica> 00,10so yeah PM
<Socks> I'll probably go to one someday but I'd need to find someone to go with first time I think.
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> comic-con was full of way too many people and the lines for panels was crazy long
<Kencolt> I rarely bothered with panels-- except the one time I was on one.
<oni_link> Whoo Party with Pinkie
<Socks> Kencolt: What panel were you on?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I missed the korra panel cause the firefly panel was before it and those guys camped out all night
<Kencolt> Socks: Years ago, when I was a fanfiction writer of some note... a fanfiction writer's panel. Known mostly for a Ranma fic called "Girl Days". Some people still call it the most original flavor fic ever written. I bluch now.
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...Is it related to "School Days"?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> spent way too much money there
<Socks> Kencolt: That's pretty cool :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm excited for November.
<Socks> I would love to be on a con panel one day *stares into the middle distance longingly*
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<tjitjan> heya proplr :)
<Kencolt> Spell-of-Gaming: No... I wrote under the name Kenko. It was the first-- as far as I know, to take the whole "Ranma has to be a girl for a while" and to the best of my ability do it as Takahashi would have. Most readers think I pulled it off.
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> i ran some booths at a few local conventions
<Kencolt> In other words, with near total batchit chaos and insanity. Oh, and skewering every fanfic cliche I could find while I was at it.
<Spell-of-Gaming> MLP:FiM Season 3 + Adventure Time Season 5 = SO AWESOME /)^_^(\
*Spell-of-Gaming pokes NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> one of the DVDs come with a Finn cap

<Socks> I'm howling at the moon, and sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon!
<oni_link> Malavolent: you can find time lol I do it for a bit in bed after I get home from work. It gives you something to watch when there isnt anything on TV.
<XAX> Alright. It is done. Reset my 151 caught save on Pokemon red.
<XAX> Now, what name the trainer on this run through...
<Socks> I always name my trainers Cody.
<oni_link> Im also getting through Dr. Who :P Im on David Tennant and I previously finished Christopher Eccleston
<Socks> Chris Eccleston series was very good
<Socks> Not that he thinks so...
<XAX> Eccleston was awesome.
<XAX> Tennant, though...
<XAX> fucking legend.
<oni_link> I liked it alot too, it seems to get better as it goes along :) David Tennant is beastly
<Socks> Tennant is my second favourite Doctor
<Socks> After mr. Tom Baker himself
<oni_link> Ah, I havent seen the older ones. They worth going back to?
<Socks> A lot of them yes, I haven't seen many though. All the ones with TB are awesome.
<oni_link> I will get on that then :P I really like the show.
<Socks> It's very cheesy
<Socks> But it's good cheese
<Socks> Like Edam
<MadSurge> ^
<oni_link> Best way to put it
<Socks> Doctor Who is like Edam
<oni_link> Like I told my brother, I like the concepts they have, but their execution could use some work. It wouldnt hurt to increase the special effect budget but than again I also believe that that is one of its charms
<Socks> oni_link: The question of the moment is, what do you think...
<XAX> guys
<Socks> of Rose!
<XAX> name garry for my new game on red
<oni_link> Ah good question. Rose... I can do without but I also dont mind that shes there.
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> isnt BBC basically public television, so I dont see them having a very big budget
<oni_link> XAX: and Ash is your rival?
<Socks> Close enough, I personally think she is the very spawn of the devil but close enough
<oni_link> DeadpoolDash|GW2: More viewers. People who buy HDTVs want their moneys worth
<XAX> oni_link: No. Im asking for someone to give me a name for Garry.
<XAX> ._.
<oni_link> XAX: call him Blue!
<oni_link> classic
<AJIsAwesome> What did you name your main character?
<Moopy> night everypony im off to bed see yall in the morning when i wake up aight...........peace.
<XAX> ._. But his name is green in the manga.
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Moopy. :)
<XAX> AJIsAwesome: Nothing in particular ._.
<oni_link> Night Moopy
<Socks> DeadpoolDash|GW2: It's funded by the public, every person in britain has to pay a TV license, they have fairly big budgets for their stuff. It's not like PBS
<Moopy> love ya guys
<oni_link> XAX: yeah but if you follow the game's story its Blue XD
<Socks> Bye Moopy
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> ah, so people pay a TV tax then
<oni_link> Speaking of, I barely got to the part where Yellow was introduced
<XAX> oni_link: but... but... D:
<Socks> DeadpoolDash|GW2: Correct
<XAX> oni_link: The yellow arc is good :D
<Socks> BIG IT UP! Pokemon Yellow!
<oni_link> XAX: I need to get back on that :P name him Green then
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> lame, but PBS is federally funded through taxpayer dollars in addition to fundraisers
<XAX> oni_link: I guess I will.
<oni_link> Different places, different methods of operations
<XAX> I KNOW!
<oni_link> XAX: Im not very creative with names lol
<XAX> I'll name him OP
<XAX> because OP is a faggot
<XAX> >_>
<oni_link> XAX lmao
<oni_link> or because hes OVER POWERED
<Socks> DeadpoolDash|GW2: The laws surrounding tv ownership are complex but the BBC isn't a goverment funded thing, it's an institution, you need to pay the license fee to own a television and hence BBC shows have no Adverts and are willing to take more risks n' stuff
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> ah
<Socks> It's complicated to explain to someone outside the UK
<Malavolent> Did anyone say... Doctor Who?
<oni_link> Crap id pay more for a higher budget on Dr. Who alone...
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<oni_link> Malavolent: yeah, weve been going on about it for awhile :P
<oni_link> hey DerpyMuffins
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> so basically what premium cable channels are like HBO and Showtime
<Socks> Hey DerpyMuffins
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DerpyMuffins. :)
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo DerpyMuffins
<AJIsAwesome> Have some music. :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwoaMdkQs0A&feature=channel&list=UL
<Malavolent> oni_link, I was kinda afk for a minute. But I like where is this discussion going.
<oni_link> DeadpoolDash|GW2: Yeah, you pay a premium for no commercials and such correct??
<DerpyMuffins> Hows it going?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> yes
<AJIsAwesome> Pretty good, DerpyMuffins.
<oni_link> DerpyMuffins: good so far
<Socks> DeadpoolDash|GW2: From what I understand, yes, except you have to pay them if you want to watch TV at all it's not optional.
<Socks> So a half tac
<Socks> *tax
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I like my free TV
<oni_link> Well I dont get it, Id have to get a different plan to get it. I watch off of Netflix
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> so I'll deal with commercials
<oni_link> I hope they update soon...
<Socks> We still get the BBC which is all kinds of awesome :)
<oni_link> I dont mind paying extra for HD and no commercials but I dont want to get a new plan for just one channel
<oni_link> also, Im getting cable for "free" anyways lol
<Socks> But for a small ammount of money a year you get BBC's 1,2,3,4 and 7 radio channels as well as a news channel and BBC parliment, plus all other TV ever.
<Socks> -ish
<oni_link> I like how they do things there better Socks. Im paying for Netflix and Internet though so thats my option at the moment
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> well commercials help support various parts of the economy, so I'm fine with them
<oni_link> This is also why they wanted to get the Dish Hopper pulled. the commercial skipping feature was "interfering with commercials" since it was on by default
<Socks> Fine with commercials but since the BBC doesn't have to satisfy the advertisers it doesn't have to meet a standerd crap meter all the other channels do. It can satisfy the needs of niche cultures, such as Doctor Who, no other NEtwork would put on Doctor WHo it would be too risky.
<DerpyMuffins> Whats the BState debate about this time?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> BBC America has Doctor Who, but we also have commercials
<oni_link> DerpyMuffins: Dr Who and networks :P
<Socks> Does BBC america have commercials?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> yes
<Socks> Unlucky.
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> we are used to it
<Prince_Lightstar> wait thiz many ppl on in middle of night
<oni_link> Also its 3am here. Id love to talk with you all but Im having a hard time staying awake. Well, thanks for the great conversation. Bye Socks, DeadpoolDash|GW2/
<Prince_Lightstar> i yhought there would be
<Prince_Lightstar> like 2 ppl
<oni_link> also thanks for the music AJIsAwesome
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> about 2am here
<Socks> Bye oni_link :)
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, oni_link. :)
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...How are you going to get money without commercials?
<AJIsAwesome> Take care. :)
<Socks> 11am
<Prince_Lightstar> 5am
<Prince_Lightstar> here
<AJIsAwesome> 5:13 AM.
<Socks> Spell-of-Gaming: By how the BBC does it
<DerpyMuffins> 11:14
<Socks> I've been through this!
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> lolz
<Prince_Lightstar> AJIsAwesome: its 5:14 where i live 6_9
<Prince_Lightstar> now 5:15 :P
<Prince_Lightstar> <_<
<Socks> One thing about American Advertising which surprised me when I went to new york, I was watching the big bang theory and I counted around 6 ad breaks wheras in the UK the max ad breaks for a show that short would be 2 and normally 1.
<Prince_Lightstar> no vid :|
<Socks> There was literaly a segment which was 5mins long!
<Socks> That's insane!
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> well that show is on in a 30 minute block
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> so the usually mean 5-10 minutes of commercials
<Prince_Lightstar> derpy
<Socks> But still! It breaks up the flow of the show terriably.
<Prince_Lightstar> derpy iz bout the most famus pony to ppl
<Prince_Lightstar> :P
<Socks> Prince_Lightstar: I heard about Derpy before I heard about any of the mane 6
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone have a cute woona pic?
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> the only shows that might not have breaks in them are the 15 minute block shows
<Prince_Lightstar> Socks: thats mah poine
<Prince_Lightstar> point
<Socks> :D
<Gold_Demona> DeadpoolDash|GW2: Or shows on PBS. :P
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> PBS has commercials
<Socks> Well I'm glad I live in a near ad breakless society. RULE BRITANIA!
<Gold_Demona> Between shows
<Prince_Lightstar> and also i was watchin background ponie b4 the mane6
<Gold_Demona> They never interrupt their shows
<Prince_Lightstar> i was lookin at djs on utube and found vynilscratch
<Gold_Demona> Unless they're doing a telethon thing
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I think i have seen episodes of NOVA with breaks
<Gold_Demona> I never have
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> oh course, I havent watched PBS in forever
<AJIsAwesome> I do have to say the KYM video about MLP could've used more effort. It was like they weren't even trying to make this fandom look good.
<Socks> HAs anyone seen the PBS idea channel?
<AJIsAwesome> I have.
<Gold_Demona> idea channel?
<AJIsAwesome> One second.
<Socks> It's a youtube thing
<Socks> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Est3UNs-LIk
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> the KYM was pretty informative without pandering to the fandom
<AJIsAwesome> DeadpoolDash|GW2: Try, but I'm mainly talking about the video, not the documented information.
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> well it did come from 4chan
<Prince_Lightstar> list to fav manesix
<Prince_Lightstar> dont know y i typed six
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> almost nothing nice comes from 4chan
<AJIsAwesome> DeadpoolDash|GW2: That's true. too.
<Socks> ^
<Prince_Lightstar> rd aj fs pp r tl
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> ponies is one of the exceptions and it was used mostly to troll
<Prince_Lightstar> yes
<DerpyMuffins> How long thos debate been going on for?
<DerpyMuffins> this
<AJIsAwesome> Which one?
<Prince_Lightstar> like puttun an awesome combo up
<DerpyMuffins> Idk it seems to be many
<DeadpoolDash|GW2> I hope a release for Mane6 comes out soon
<Socks> Right guys, I'm out of here, I've got History now.

<Kurra> XDDDD
<MadSurge> Ah, dat classic "hate the player" level design
<Lil_B> yeah, in the SNES Version you HAD to play through the Game without getting touched (you are not allowed to loose the armor) to get to the Final Boss -.- I imagin it's nopt different here
<MadSurge> Lil_B: you need the shield weapon to get to Astaroth
<MadSurge> BOTH TIMES
<Lil_B> MadSurge yes, and it is awful :P
<Gold_Demona> lol
<MadSurge> And the Satan boss is a really hard mofo to defeat with the shield
<Gold_Demona> Oh geez the Ninja Turtles game
<Sylandest> I'm waiting for the bit where he does something spooky or he gets scared
<Sylandest> if there is one
<MadSurge> There is a pattern to the red devil you know

<Sylandest> stop-motion animation is usually pretty good...this isn't too bad
<Rev> Is it a music video?
<Sylandest> hello, whats this?
<Sylandest> bunch of copycats, lol
<Lil_B> EVIL!
<Sylandest> just a tad, Lil_B
<Rev> What's going on?
<Sylandest> some form of social critique, perhaps?
<Lil_B> ......
<Rev> Is it a music video?
<Sylandest> no, just animation
<Rev> Does it have a soldier?
<Sylandest> XD
<Sylandest> nicely done
<Rev> It might be a video I linked
<Lil_B> this is only a music Video
<Rev> If it is it's ohGr's music video for Cracker
<Lil_B> or rather the Intro to a Game, but it is pretty much a music Video
<Lil_B> The Game is a Point and Klick Adventure about a little Girl that pretty much is clumsy, has hallucinations and somehow kills 7 people withouit realizing it
<Kimori> I think my hard drive is on the verge of going out after today

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> "Overwhelmed with having to choose just one friend to spend time with, Pinkie Pie uses a magic mirror to clone herself."
<Gold_Demona> This was my first time seeing raptor jesus...

<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Star Whorse: Episode II: Attack of the Changelings
<Hoody|Skool> Why is it so quiet in here...
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hoody|Skool: Most people are still at work, or school

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why are youtube poops so god damn weird?
<Moopy> ikr
<alexxm> i'm good Hoody|Skool
<Hoody|Skool> Why are they called youtube poop?
<Rev> Scoot-Scootaloo: Play some Ministry
<alexxm> is there a stream?
<Moopy> yup
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Sorry I don't listen to rap...
<Rev> Ministry isn't rap
<Rev> It isn't even close
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03you're not even rap :P
<DashWithRainbows> Scoots, you're always listening to rap
<DashWithRainbows> all MLG kids listen to rap
<DashWithRainbows> and dubstep
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Am I wrong to sometimes think some peoples opinion is retarded from my viewpoint?
<Hoody|Skool> SpadeMagnes[School]: maybe
<DashWithRainbows> No, that's fine. It happens with many of us. Although, I wouldn't say "Retarded", I'd go with "A high level of stupidity."
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: that makes it your opinion
<Hoody|Skool> I view stupidity as mere inorance, not actual mental retardation
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Because i watched a video and he said something about "bad" graphics and lack of voice actign affectes story telling
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I personally find that retarded
<Kimori> hey Stormy`
<Sonny> No nittany yet?
<Stormy`> hey
<Sonny> alright :p
<Hoody|Skool> Dinosaurs and nun
<Hoody|Skool> ok then
<Hoody|Skool> I hat this keyoard
<Kammerjunk> I used to hat my old keyboard.
<Kammerjunk> But then fedora.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Nothing annoys me more than people who think graphics make the game
<Hoody|Skool> Bees annoy me :S
<Rev> They can though
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But the story is what counts
<Kammerjunk> Graphics = a way to show the story.
<Rev> If you can't tell the difference between a friend and enemy then you're a bit fucked
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: it certainly doesn't hurt. but at a certain level it doesn't matter anymore
<alexxm> guile appears
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03dat crit
<Eli> that bill murray?
<Hoody|Skool> Dayum
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Gulies theme goes with every thing
<Hoody|Skool> How do you blow up a tank with a gun?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hoody|Skool: Very carefully?
<Eli> what's that movie?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Hoody|Skool: Aim for it's weak point for Massive Damage!
<Spectrum_Rush> saving private ryan
<alexxm> Hoody|Skool spiral power
<Moopy> what shoot it in the hole were the tank shoots it out
<Eli> Spectrum_Rush: ... sad that i have never watched it, actually. hear so much good about it
<Kammerjunk> Hoody|Skool: Trick question. It's the handgun from MiB.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Are all the army graves just crosses?
<Hoody|Skool> But he was wearing green...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03last video before I go to my other, less cancelled clas...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03class*
<Kammerjunk> Cancalled classes are my least favourite kind.
<alexxm> run away
<Hoody|Skool> French got cancelled at my school
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh god damn it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> MURIKA
<Rev> You could blow up a tank if you're able to hit the fuel tank and ignite the fuel
<alexxm> epic 4th wall breaking
<Eli> Rev: yeah you could think that, but fuel doesn't really ignite like it does in movies
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Every car is not a pinto
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03hope you enjoyed! :$
<Rev> I know it doesn't
<Hoody|Skool> ty for teh stream, Scoots
<Rev> It's the fumes that ignite really
<alexxm> thanks for the stream Scoot-Scootaloo
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Yea mythbusters tried exploding a car via shooting the gas tank
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I missed a request time.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> That didnt work
<Hoody|Skool> Damn, I gtg, latas bstate
<Eli> Rev: the fuel tank would have to be about 3/4 empty and there (mlp refrence) would have to be a spark. not just a shot
<Colt_Brovakiin> Bye Hoody|Skool :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also you guys know those bug bomb things?
<alexxm> bye Hoody|Skool
<alexxm> i have a driving lesson today
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well I just beat Black 2's Elite 4 last night
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My genesect pretty much fucking soloed the place
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03CHEAP
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: there's a black 2??
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And a white 2
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: ah... pokemon
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Theres actually a medal for beating the elite 4 with a team of one type
<SpadeMagnes[School]> and one for beating it with just one pokemon
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also B2/W2 is first to break pokemon tradition and give you two masterballs
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: haven't played any pokemon in years. i still have a almost full diamond lying around and a almost unplayed white of my little brother, but no DS i think :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I used to remember when shiny pokemon were rare, now they just give them away...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03They give you a shiny gabite or dratini at one point~
<SpadeMagnes[School]> and a shiny haxorus
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also Imprision is the most usless fucking move ever
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It only is useful if the opponent has one of the moves you have
<doctor_whooves127> then use it on a smergel
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I do like the new kyurem
<doctor_whooves127> black or white kyurem?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Black
<doctor_whooves127> yeah i like the black verion better too
<doctor_whooves127> version
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also Black and white 2 seem to be the only game so far that lets you refight legendaries you accidentaly K.O
<alexxm> SpadeMagnes[School] they put that feature in how does it work
<doctor_whooves127> yeah thats been around for a while most would reappear after beating the elite
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You just have to re beat the elite four and go back to where you fought it the first time
<Kimori> how are ya?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also Juniper apperently can give you a item to increase shiny encounter rates
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its fucking impossible to get though
<doctor_whooves127> yeah you have to complete the national dex
<DashWithRainbows> Yeah, it makes it a 1/3000-ish chance instead of a 1/8000+ chance.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Good luck...some pokemon you cant even get, unless you get lucky via GTC
<Gold_Demona> SpadeMagnes[School]: Yeah, you have to complete the pokédex to get that item
<Gold_Demona> That increases shiny encounter
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well my pokedex in black was...I think 400 something
<doctor_whooves127> This Key Item increases the likelihood that you will encounter Shiny Pokémon. When you have the item in your bag, then the chances of encountering Shiny Pokémon in the wild is increased to 300% of normal, making it a 1 in 2,370.6 chance. If, however, you're using the Masuda Method to breed, it increased it from 1 in 1,365.3 down to 1 in 1024.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Masuda method?
<DashWithRainbows> I can't remember mine, can't check either due to my DS breaking.
<Kimori> btw if I disappear all of a sudden, its because of my hard drive ._.
<Stormy`> I'm good, you?
<Stormy`> D:
<Gold_Demona> I stopped bothering with the pokédex after gen 2
<Stormy`> that's not good
<Sonny> Heya everypony
<Gold_Demona> It stopped being worth it after that
<doctor_whooves127> breeding with forign game pokemon
<Kimori> today it suddenly started freezing up
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The only legendaries I lack are celibi, deoxys,mew,keldeo...and.... thats it
<Kimori> I checked its health and noticed the sector count dropping
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have a jirachi...
<Sonny> okay.png :(
<Kimori> I'm surprised it hasnt started clicking yet
<doctor_whooves127> i have keldeo
<DashWithRainbows> Bah, legendaries
<ASoftFluffyThing> Morning, guys
<Gold_Demona> Hi Sonny
<Sonny> ASoftFluffyThing: morning? :p
<Sonny> oh
<DashWithRainbows> All I need is Latias and Latios.
<Sonny> keep forgetting the time-and-space thingy on our world >_>
<ASoftFluffyThing> Sonny, 11am for me
<Colt_Brovakiin> Ohai Sonny and ASoftFluffyThing :)
<Sonny> it's 5:07 here pm
<Sonny> heya
<Gold_Demona> Sonny: Time zones. They're awesome. XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hai Colt_Brovakiin
<doctor_whooves127> 10:07 here
<alexxm> how are things ASoftFluffyThing
<Gold_Demona> It's 11am over here
<Kimori> Need to see if I can get my desktop working again
<doctor_whooves127> a.m.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Doing fine, alexxm. Just waking up.
<Stormy`> what's wrong with your desktop?
<Sonny> Gold_Demona: I actually dislaike them somtimes, since their are some friends who can only come on when it's midnight
<Sonny> -_-
<Kimori> oh its just missing software
<Stormy`> ah
<Sonny> How are things alexxm
<Kimori> I havent used it in so long because my laptops my main computer
<Kimori> I will probably end up getting a new laptop on black friday :P
<Kimori> If I see a deal thats good enough
<Serenity> Hey everypony
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Serenity!
<Stormy`> oh, that's not a bad idea
<Kimori> Thats how I bought skylanders last year
<Sonny> hey Everlasting_Joy
<Serenity> And I've been here a year and 3 months, and just realised the pun in "Bronystate" :U
<Kimori> bought a huge bundle from best buy for $70 bucks
<Colt_Brovakiin> heya Serenity and Everlasting_Joy :)
<alexxm> how are things Serenity and Everlasting_Joy
<Sonny> Serenity: really?
<Kimori> I'm hoping they do it again this year...
<Sonny> lol
<Stormy`> I kind of want a new laptop since mine's falling apart, but I can't justify spending another $1000 on a laptop when the only thing that's wrong with this one is the hinge
<Serenity> Brone estate :L
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Sonny and Colt_Brovakiin!
<Kimori> $1000? o.o
<Stormy`> yeah... >_>
<Kimori> I only spent $400 on this one
<Sonny> howdy ya'll ^^
<Sonny> :p
<Everlasting_Joy> alexxm: Could be better, but I'm not complaining too terribly.
<Kimori> but I spent $60 upgrading the RAM on it
<Everlasting_Joy> alexxm: I will say this, it could be Friday.
<Kimori> might be more now that I think about it..
<Stormy`> I only spent like $250 on my first one, so I felt like splurging
<Kimori> I wanted to add a 4GB RAM stick to my laptop
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Friday friday gotta get down on friday
<Kimori> Is DDR3 still the newest ram right now?
<Sonny> 7 am waking up in da morningszszszzzsz *failed duckface*
<Stormy`> I think so
<Kimori> I was going to pull the ram out of this laptop and put it in a new one..
<Sonny> hated that song so much
<Sonny> now if I hear it I laugh :p
<Stormy`> I haven't heard of anything newer
<Kimori> awesome
<Sonny> mhm...
<Gold_Demona> 7am and I go back to sleep. -.-
<Stormy`> well, if you're going to upgrade that laptop you should probably do something about the hard drive first :P
<Sonny> would be a much better version
<Sonny> :p
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Sonny!
<Stormy`> Any way you could just replace the hard drive without buying a completely new computer?
<Gold_Demona> I saw a flipnote of that
<Sonny> howdy Everlasting_Joy!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wish pokemon you got via wifi mystery gifts you could nickname
<Sonny> I think I finally have come to a conclusion
<Kimori> I was thinking of doing that
<Sonny> My favourite pony is
<Sonny> . . .
<Kimori> but its going to cost me close to $100 to do that
<Gold_Demona> spike
*SpadeMagnes[School] drum rolls
<Sonny> thanks for that
<Sonny> :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> Welp, I need to sleep
<Spell-of-Gaming> bai :3
*Sonny drum rolls
<Sonny> bye Spell-of-Gaming
<Sonny> . . .
<Gold_Demona> Laters Spell-of-Gaming
<Stormy`> what size hard drive would you get?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bye Spell-of-Gaming
<Everlasting_Joy> Night night Spell-of-Gaming!
<Sonny> Pinkie Pie! :o
<Kimori> It needs to be at least 200gb
<Gold_Demona> Yay!~
<Colt_Brovakiin> Bye Spell-of-Gaming
<Sonny> since she kind of reflect my personality ^^
<Gold_Demona> Pinkie is best party pony
<Everlasting_Joy> Sonny: yay!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> She's the only party pony
<Sonny> except that I don't have a Pinkie-sence or laugh and break the 4th wall
<Maid_Rainbow> Gold_Demona : thats a silly way to spell Twilight is best pony
<Gold_Demona> Maid_Rainbow: I didn't say best pony. I said best PARTY pony
<Sonny> Maid_Rainbow: I never said she was best pony
<Gold_Demona> Twilight is not best party pony
<Everlasting_Joy> Meh Pinke > Twi.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Luna is best pony
<Sonny> Maid_Rainbow: I said she was my favourite ^^
<Kimori> I really don't want to get a laptop with windows 8
<Sonny> oh god Everlasting_Joy don't go making sttements like that HERE O_O
<Sonny> Discussion alert!
<Sonny> >_>
<SpadeMagnes[School]> NERD BATTLE
<Kimori> I might just stick to using a desktop
<Stormy`> Yeah <_<
<Kimori> and get a tablet
<Gold_Demona> Sonny: There's a difference?
<Sonny> MOTHER OF GOD °_°
<Sonny> ye Gold_Demona
<Kimori> I have a bunch of spare parts for my desktop anyways
<Everlasting_Joy> Sonny: Don't you see what the fun is of this? Now I'll flee and leave everyone angry. Muahahahha!
<Stormy`> I know a couple people who like Windows 8...
<Kimori> who?
<Stormy`> IRL friends
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But I'm already behind you
<Kimori> I just don't want to upgrade because I know some of my stuff wont work
<Everlasting_Joy> Muahahaha! In America.
<Kimori> my webcam didnt work when I changed to windows 7, same for my printer
<Stormy`> One guy got the beta version or something on his laptop
<Sonny> my FAVOURITE pony is Pinkie Pie, but the BEST pony is based on what EVERYBODY thinks like who represents the most of my little pony is supose to represent or who is the BEST in being a pony
<SpadeMagnes[School]> One does not simply chose a favorite pony
<Stormy`> I keep telling them the UI is weird and doesn't make sense, and they just say "you get used to it"
<Sonny> so saying that a specific pony is the best pony is just your own personal choice :p
<Gold_Demona> Sonny: nonono. You are confusing "best" pony with "most popular" pony. :P
<Sonny> SpadeMagnes[School]: exactly
<Stormy`> Well okay, but that doesn't stop it from being a crappy design
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *choose
<Sonny> Gold_Demona: not most popular, but the one who represent the most of what a pony is supose to represent or who has the most positive atributes
*SpadeMagnes[School] walks into Mordor
<Sonny> ^DEAL WITH IT
<Gold_Demona> Sonny: So in other words... None of them. :P
<Stormy`> I just don't get why they made it transition between the "tablet/touchscreen" interface and traditional windows
<Stormy`> just pick one or the other...
<Sonny> Gold_Demona: it has been scientifically proven that the best pony...
<Gold_Demona> is spike
*Sonny *drum rolls*
<Sonny> is....
<Maid_Rainbow> well everypony i have to go
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My favorite is twilight because..well I'm pretty much like her.
<Sonny> bye Maid_Rainbow
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai
*Sonny eats an apple in slowmotion to add extra dramatic effect
*Sonny *glump*
<Gold_Demona> As far as personality, I'm sort of a cross between Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie.
<Kimori> I'm guessing that Microsoft wants to compete with apple
<Sonny> . . .
<Kimori> I saw their commercial for their new tablet too, it looks nice, I can see the windows 8 working with a tablet
<Kimori> but for a desktop...I dont know
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im so much like Twilight I pretty much panic when schoolwork is late
<Gold_Demona> I like all the goofy fun stuff, but I'm really shy about it. ^^
<Sonny> damnit I can't find it O_O
<Stormy`> yeah, I would like it tablets I think
<Sonny> some say it's derpy
<Stormy`> *on tablets
<Sonny> some say it's Twi
<Kimori> It looked like there were some things that took more steps if you had a laptop/desktop
<Stormy`> it's very awkward to use on a non-touchscreen though
*Gold_Demona is actually eating an apple.
<Stormy`> at least to me
<Kimori> exactly, I agree
<Jmo> nemnemnemnemnem
*Everlasting_Joy will eat an apple at lunch :).
<Stormy`> maybe they should've just made it a tablet OS
<Gold_Demona> It IS lunchtime for me. lol XD
<Sonny> I think Derpy is so high rated because she was basicly a background character who was pointed out by the fanbase and actually brought into a scene
<Kimori> I saw a comment online a few months ago, every OS that Microsoft makes is good and bad
<Sonny> as for Twi, because she has somthing we all have in personallity or so I think, she's rational
<Kimori> Windows 98 good, windows ME bad, windows XP good, Vista bad, windows 7 good, windows 8...well
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FONN-0uoTHI
<Sonny> and she's the main character of the show (as pointed out)
<Stormy`> haha, that's interesting
<Kimori> Skip windows 8 and wait for windows 9 :P
<Sonny> so yeah
<Kimori> Actually windows 95 wasnt bad right?
<Stormy`> I'm too young to really remember Windows 98, but I remember my dad installing Windows ME...
<Sonny> ultimate battle between Derpy and Twi I guess °-°
<Kimori> I havent actually used it so I dont know..
<Stormy`> I don't remember 95 at all haha
<Sonny> or hugs and nobody cares because of adorableness <3
<Kimori> me neither, didnt have a computer with it at the time
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Despite me having a dislike for Celestia, I still hate Diamon Tiara more
<alexxm> ok i have a driving lesson now back in a couple of hours
<Stormy`> But we had ME for probably like 2 weeks
<Kimori> earliest OS I had was windows 98
<Stormy`> And we reverted it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *Diamond
<Stormy`> My favorite is still XP... probably because my first laptop had it
<Kimori> I still like the windows 98 startup theme
<Sonny> bye alexxm|afk
<Kimori> Picture hearing that in a classroom when 30 computers turn on at once
<Sonny> well I find one thing a little odd in mlp fim
<Sonny> celestia, you know the princess?
<Gold_Demona> What about her?
<Kimori> Gotta head off for now
<Kimori> be back in 30-60 minutes :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Yeah, what of her?
<Stormy`> me too actually
<Kimori> oh ok
<Sonny> well... she has the power to raise (so actually move) the FREAKING SUN wich is about 100000 times the mass of the earth...
<Kimori> I keep forgetting too to PM you
<SpadeMagnes[School]> and?
<Sonny> and she can't even stop a single changeling queen?
<Gold_Demona> But it's not Earth. It's Equestria
<Kimori> message me when your back on :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Plot,magic
<Sonny> and I'm like... hu?
<Sonny> right BUT
<Stormy`> Okay
<Sonny> equestria has to be a planet as well right?
<Kimori> see you
<Stormy`> See ya
<Gold_Demona> Not as we know it
<Everlasting_Joy> Moving the sun =/= absolute power.
<Sonny> and asuming there's a minumun you can go to create an actual sun that works the way ours does
<Gold_Demona> But it doesn't. :P
<Everlasting_Joy> Heck, S2E13 states unicorns can do it.
<Sonny> it's jsut
<Gold_Demona> It's not even a proper solar system. It's all magic.
<Sonny> just*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I know its a cartoon but a sun rotating around a planet sounds weird
<Sonny> messing up Logic
<Wrek> 05Everlasting_Joy: no, ultimate power is when the sun moves itself for you
<Jmo> MEEEEEEEGIC
<Sonny> Wrek: have you seen nittany lately?
<Sonny> I need to send him somthing °-°
<doctor_whooves127> what if the sun is small but really close
<Wrek> 05last i knew he was workign as a maid on new adventures
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Yay! I've been wondering where you've been :).
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I'd have to say the Wedding episode cemented my hatred for celestia
<Sonny> Wrek: ok, thanks
*Everlasting_Joy glomps Wrek.
<Wrek> 05^_^
<Gold_Demona> ohai Wrek. :D
<MadSurge> I'm back paesani \:3/
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy MadSurge.
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[School], really? How? For falling for Queen Chrysalis' masquerade like everypony else and then getting her horn handed to her while fighting her?
<Gold_Demona> Only one peasant, MadSurge?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> >completly doubts your student you raised for years, don't apollogize when she was right
<MadSurge> I hear again! But I gotta take some meds for the ear swelling
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The fuck celestia
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Sounds nasty. :<
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's the plural you silly :)
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[School], hmm, good point.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: nope, just a pill a day
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I would forgive her if she said at least IM SORRY
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But no she doesnt even say that!
<Gold_Demona> SpadeMagnes[School]: Nobody did
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so I assume you enjoyed my request? :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Applejack did
<Gold_Demona> And...?
<Kandarihu> However, the way Twilight Sparkle came out with her theory was rather improper. It's quite akin to Joe Wilson shouting "YOU LIE" during Obama's speech. Obama probably was lying, but Wilson was the one who got in trouble for breaking protocol.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The fact twilight's mentor pretty much mother figure, shot her down like nothing and didnt even fucking apollogize
<MadSurge> ^
<MadSurge> I mean, I agree with Kandarihu
<Gold_Demona> The way Twilight went about it, I wouldn't have believed her either. =/
<MadSurge> Just because you're right you have to back up your claims.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I would have given her the benifit of the doubt
<doctor_whooves127> honestly the bigest problem is that chrysalis basically revieled herself after managing to convince twilight that shes not evil...
<MadSurge> *still
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wouldent be so mean to instantly doubt her
<Wrek> 05easy
<Everlasting_Joy> doctor_whooves127: She revealed herself when Cadence showed up, and we have Twi saying "You're not the real Cadence."
<Wrek> 05twi would know from her filly years that cadences magis is pinkish
<MadSurge> doctor_whooves127: she was too dangerous, and thought the caves to be inescapable
<Wrek> 05emedietly expose her casue its green
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Her's is blue.
<Wrek> 05blue
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also the fact they blow off the fact Cadence is a total bitch
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No no its just the wedding! Bullshit
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[School]: You clearly haven't prepped for something as big as a wedding, have you?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I doubt every wedding makes the bride a total ass
<Gold_Demona> SpadeMagnes[School]: You have no idea how stressful it is to plan a wedding.
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: that might be, but some brides really become bitches during the most important day of their life
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: were you a bridezilla too? :D
<Everlasting_Joy> They want it go perfectly and if it isn't, there will be hell to pay.
<Gold_Demona> SpadeMagnes[School]: It's REALLY nerve-racking. I can tell you from experience I was NOT myself during the months before the wedding.
<Serenity> Those reasons are why Girlfriends are out of my question. Too much hassle
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Yea but no one even bats a eye thats was gets me
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: No, but I was a nervous wreck
<Wrek> 05Serenity: girlfriedns are awesome
<Sonny> brb
<Serenity> What's a girlfried?
<Gold_Demona> SpadeMagnes[School]: That close to the wedding, I wouldn't be suspicious either.
<Wrek> 05as are wifes, problem comes in the transition
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[School]: The others got wrapped up and bitchy brides are expected.
<Serenity> Is it a new Macciedee's meal?
<Wrek> 05besides nowadays a marriage isnt more than something financial
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I can imagine. A wedding is also a big chore
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also since twilight was raised by Cadence for awhile it would be easy for her to tell if she was actually her
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: No kidding! My wedding was just a little traditional one, but dear GOD there was a lot of planning involved.
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: yes, but only her knew Cadence really well
<Gold_Demona> So many choices to make!
<Kandarihu> If I ever get married, the last thing I'd want is for everything to go perfectly. I'll remember the wedding only for what went wrong, and I'll laugh.
<Wrek> 05like inviting me to a wedding
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: great attitude dude :D
<Gold_Demona> All getting shoved in your face... @_o
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wrek: Whats the worst you could do?
<Wrek> 05next thing you know there will be metal music from the organs and permafrost
<Everlasting_Joy> ^:D
<Wrek> 05aswell as booze
<MadSurge> Wrek: FUCK YEAH VIKING WEDDING
<Everlasting_Joy> It's not a wedding without booze.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I know it has nothing to do with the plot but you would think the crowd would notice "Cadence" singing about her evil plan
<doctor_whooves127> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHPOesXCFcI
<Vivix> I would ban booze at my wedding
<Serenity> ^
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[School]: It's called soliloquy.
<Gold_Demona> The choices... The choices... Th cake... the music... the damn flowers... the catering... the church... the dance hall... coordinating the bridal party...
<Serenity> I. Hate. Drunkards. More. Than. Anything
<Wrek> 05maybe at the actuall wedding
<Wrek> 05but then comes the after party
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im still peeved Luna did nothing in the episode
<Wrek> 05cermony*
<Vivix> I wouldn't have an after party- unless he or she wanted one- but even then, no booze pls- for my sake
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: noone bats an eye at songs. She might have sang under her breath for as much as we know
<Wrek> 05you say no boose
<Everlasting_Joy> >Gets married > Dies of alcohol poisoning.
<Gold_Demona> What?! Not even champagne?! Travesty! No bridal toast?!
<Kandarihu> Alright. I'm not an alcoholic, so I wouldn't have booze at my wedding. I'm a geek and a gamer and I would be bored if there were nothing of interest at my wedding.
<Wrek> 05clearly you havent had snaps with me
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: although yes, Luna needs more action
<Wrek> 05so much fun
<Vivix> ;__;
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The did I miss anything seems so trollish
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: same
<Panda> ?
<Jmo> Pondoo
<Wrek> 05Everlasting_Joy: if i ever visit the US
<Gold_Demona> I'm not an alcoholic either, but I don't believe you can raise a toast without champagne. >.>
<Wrek> 05ill brign a bottle of snaps
<killerpony7733> Wrek Ice cold snaps=oh god kill me
<Spectrum_Rush> what a pic to choose for boxart for one of your flagships :S http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/303/057/925.png
<Wrek> 05and 2 glasses
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: nope
<Vivix> scchhhhnaps
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No luna you didnt miss much, just the invasion of canterlot...
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: I'll hold you to it, but you'll have to travel a LONG way to find me :(.
<MadSurge> Spectrum_Rush: :D
<Panda> Good morning mah brownies!
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Panda :D
<Colt_Brovakiin> Ohai Panda :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Mornin' Panda!
<Vivix> I've never really had a bad alcohol experience, and drunk people can be fun, I just don't enjoy the thought of being drunk
<Panda> :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: me neither, and I HATE champagne (and all alcohol :D )
*Panda glomps Gold_Demona
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But the one time celestia actually takes action herself she gets her flank handed to her....usless princess
<Wrek> 05who said anythign about beign drunk?
<Wrek> 05tipsy at best
<MadSurge> Hello Panda :)
<Wrek> 05its the smashers you should avoid
*Panda waves to everyone
<Panda> ^
<Panda> True
<Vivix> True, if you're going to drink, that's a good attitude Wrek
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: For me it depends on the champagne. Some are good, some are not. Luckily the one I had at my wedding reception was REALLY good. :3
<Serenity> My brother
<Serenity> The bastard knocked me round the head and cracked my skull >:U
<Vivix> I don't mind having a drink now and then, but I don't enjoy being tipsy or--anything
<Everlasting_Joy> Serenity: :(.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: aww yeah! :$
<Wrek> 05worst part about being drunk
<Everlasting_Joy> The hangover?
<Wrek> 05you loose cigarretes in the thousands
<Wrek> 05i dont get hungover
<Panda> So, I come to here and the subject is alcohol huh? ^-^
<Gold_Demona> Thing is, at events like that, you trust everyone to drink responsibly. I was fortunate enough that there were no drunken incidents at my reception.
<Panda> And Wrek, keep then in your frontpocket?
<Gold_Demona> Why? Cuz everyone drank reasonably
<Everlasting_Joy> ^:)
<BladedWings> Hello Bronystate ^_^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I sort of understand the news about the 13 episodes froma buisness standpoint...but i still find it stupid
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy BladedWings!
<Wrek> 05Panda: i recall ocne i went otu for a smoke wit ha couple of friends
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: luckily I have a very phlegmatic nature and I don't get nervous very often... but a wedding is still a big thing
<Wrek> 05we ended up in our haze to smoke 6 each in a row
<Wrek> 05jstu casue we wanted to keep the convo goign
<Vivix> 13 episodes news is part of the reason, not the full reason
<Wrek> 05so we kept littign new ones :|
<Panda> Wrek, so you smoke more when you are drunk?
<Wrek> 05aye
<Panda> :/
<Panda> Perhaps when you go drinking, bring only one pack and some bubble gum, Wrek.
<Wrek> 05mine has mint filters
<Wrek> 05and 1 pack wont help
<Wrek> 05i do onyl rbing 1 pack
<Vivix> but everyone else also have cigarettes, I guess
<Wrek> 05and then people beging to give eachother and beg from eachother
<Wrek> 05eets silleh
<Vivix> here, all the rage is doing snuff instead of cigarettes
<Vivix> it's--WORSE
<Vivix> they spit that crap everywhere, our college even had it under the mixing desk in the STUDIO
<Everlasting_Joy> eww.
<Wrek> 05snuff as in nasal? or snus? :P
<Vivix> and all the pretty little dancers would wrench their lips open and spit on the ground
<Vivix> snus yeah
<Vivix> noone aims at the garbage can
<Gold_Demona> snus? O_o
<Panda> Eww... that's one type of smoker I hate Wrek, one that begs -__-
<Everlasting_Joy> Vivix: Well, that would require effort.
<Wrek> 05kidn of liek chewing tobacco but without any chewing
<Vivix> I think it's--pretty european, it's like tobacco you stuff up under your upper lip
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: Ew! O_o
<Vivix> all the 18 yearolds here are doing it
<Gold_Demona> That's.... really weird
<Panda> Don conform
<Panda> Dont*
<Wrek> 05it has its ups and downs
<Vivix> all being 40% of the smokers I guess
<Wrek> 05for isntance in a proper friend circle
<Wrek> 05we can be indoors
<Wrek> 05no one has to go out for a smoke
<Wrek> 05and theres garbage cans a plenty
<Sonny> http://memegenerator.net/instance/28914917
<Panda> True
<Panda> XD no ashe trays around?
<Wrek> 05smoking indoors isnt very...
<Vivix> In our school we would find the snus like- stuffed on windows sills, tables, everything, even if there were garbage cans like 1 meter away
<Panda> Ash*
<Wrek> 05polite
<Everlasting_Joy> http://fav.me/d5iakfc
<Wrek> 05Vivix: casue its a school
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCCQxVBfyM Tetris Time!
<Wrek> 05with you know
<Wrek> 05teenagers
<Sonny> Celestia is actually just pretending
<Vivix> well, 18+ hehe
<Wrek> 05and they cant sue their brains
<Sonny> she's over 1000 years old so she has to have somthing to do
<Sonny> :p
<Panda> well, if noone minds, I don't see the issue in that :)
<Vivix> but yeah, snus and coffecups, Eveyrwhere. by the end of the year the chef was screaming at us in the all-room about his rapidly decreasing cup-stock
<Wrek> 05what about the smoke settign inside the walls
<Panda> XD
<Wrek> 05lowering the value of the property
<Vivix> Yeah, that's worse
<Vivix> especially ceilings, you have to repaint and everything
<Panda> You can't repaint it... trust me
<Vivix> all hope is lost-
<Panda> It seeps through
<Vivix> ew~~
<Wrek> 05parintign wont fix it
<Wrek> 05hence
<Wrek> 05balconies
<Wrek> 05<3
<Panda> ^
<Panda> Eeyup
<Vivix> hehe yeah, all polite people tend to smoke outside now
<Vivix> Maybe that's why snus is more popular at winter
<Kandarihu> Wrek, before I moved into the house I live in now, I lived in a townhouse that was previously occupied by a smoker. Mom and I lived there for about 6 years, and the lingering smoke gave her headaches.
<Panda> Well, if you want white walls, you better go outside xD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdkJN_Zgtgk Mario Time
<Wrek> 05Kandarihu: proving my point further
<Wrek> 05only smoked indoors twice iirc. 1 being on the trainstation in the smokers room
<Panda> Well, my grandparents own a house and they have a designated smoke room.
<Vivix> I used to work in some communal crap for young people without jobs, and we cleaned some old guys appartment- with like 5 year old cans of cereal, and--YELLOw walls and ceilings
<Vivix> horrible
<Wrek> 05and otehr on the airport being smokers room
<Wrek> 05then id ecided not to use smokers rooms anymore casue you cant breatehr in them
<Panda> Cuz its heavy flow
<Panda> Near non stop
<Wrek> 05no cause they are tiny and cramped
<Panda> That too ^-^
<Vivix> tiny + smoke = bad
<Panda> Maybe its to get people not to smoke, I dunno.
<Panda> I quit a while ago... so...
<Wrek> 05ive been smoking less and less
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Sounds like a bathroom on campus here.
<Everlasting_Joy> No ventilation what so ever :|
<Wrek> 05yay for burritos then
<Panda> Wrek ^-^ that's good! Live longer to do more arts and for your love xD
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Thankfully, I never use it :).
<Panda> You don't use the bathroom??
<Wrek> 05he uses a bucket
<Vivix> Sneak and use the faculity one
<Everlasting_Joy> Panda: That specific bathroom silly.
<Wrek> 05and throws it out the window
<Panda> ^-^
<Wrek> 05like its 1776
<Panda> I know
<Panda> XD
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: I thought I said to keep that a secret! ;).
<Wrek> 05hehe
<Everlasting_Joy> If that were the case though, I'm lucky. I live on the top floor.
<Panda> Haha, but smoke rises
<Everlasting_Joy> Panda: Yeah. . . Rises.
<Wrek> 05Panda missed the point entirely :P
<Vivix> Summer would suck. So bad
<Everlasting_Joy> Panda: Last year, I stayed on the bottom floor, the smoke ALWAYS flowed into my room.
<Panda> Did not Wrek!
<Wrek> 05we talked about excrement
<Wrek> 05and then suddenly smoke rises
<Panda> Everlasting_Joy, that's why I'm glad I live in a smoke free area
<Panda> Wrek, this is bstate. Conversation never stays on topic xD
<Everlasting_Joy> Meh, I lived. Once winter rolled around, it got a lot easier.
<Wrek> 05peopel stopped smokign in the winter?
<Wrek> 05what kind of country does that
<SpadeMagnes[School]> "I did not hit her I did naht"
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: There's a Minnesota joke here, but I won't bother with it.
<Wrek> 05speakign of winter
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh hi SpadeMagnes[School].
<Wrek> 05its been -5 all day
<Panda> ... I d Oidn't know that smokers hibernated

<Panda> Lucky
<Panda> I want snow
<Wrek> 05but can you take the cold?
<Panda> Of course
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Too bad it will be sloppy wet stuff.
<Wrek> 05Everlasting_Joy: not really?
<Wrek> 05its cold
<Wrek> 05so the rain will freeze on reentry
<Panda> Went snowboarding with a tank top on xD I'm very insulated

<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wat
<Everlasting_Joy> We're expecing some snow, but during the day, we're above freezing; at night, it's below.
<Wrek> 05Panda: is that celcius, kelvin or madeupature?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im pretty sure we're all about cheese...not polka
<Panda> Though, I can say I didn't last long with a lack of clothing
<Panda> Um... ferinheight... how ever its spelled Wrek
<Everlasting_Joy> Panda: Like he said, madeupature.
<Wrek> 05so at its coldest it was -1 celsius
<Wrek> 05we currently have -5 outside
<Wrek> 05winters usualyl hit -30
*Vivix shudders
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Spotlight Instrumental Music: Winter Unwrapped / Firewall's Got Swag! / Solar Empire plains of war
<Vivix> We usually don't go below -25, but last two years it has been crazy cold-
<Wrek> 05so thats... -22 farenheit
<Everlasting_Joy> Pfft, I've been in winters that cold and I'm alive.
<Panda> But I've been in below 0 weather before while I was there. We arrived at the coldest time of the year and it stormed xD
<Wrek> 05Everlasting_Joy: not the point. the point is when panda sasys he can onyl wear a tanktop in -30
<Panda> Not minus 30!
<Everlasting_Joy> My bad.
<Panda> Did I say minus weather? O_o I can't be that tired
<Wrek> 05all you need to survive is a proper jacket, maybe gloves and a proper pair of shoes
<Panda> Pants
<Panda> You need pants
<Wrek> 05jeans will do
<Panda> Eeyup
<Everlasting_Joy> A good coat, hat and maybe boots and I'm set.
<Panda> Though jeans are uncomfortable to board in xD
<Wrek> 05but yeah
<Wrek> 05the coldest winter ive had
<Everlasting_Joy> It's funny, jeans don't seem to keep you warm, but they do it so well.
<Wrek> 05cant recall how cold it was
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo_CY0HcIws A wild pokemon appeared!

<Wrek> 05and it doesnt egt warmer
<Vivix> I once got a brainfreeze walking home from school. That was probably the coldest I've experienced-
<Everlasting_Joy> The coldest winter I remember was when I was in 8th grade, around 2003.
*Vivix never wears a hat
<Vivix> or lue, whatever that is in english
<Panda> I love how quickly the chat moves. Alcohol>smoking>winter
<Wrek> 05i fail to wear a hat aswell
*Panda wears hats
<Everlasting_Joy> I remember for about two weeks, the high was in the -20 to -30 F (-28 to -34) and the nights were even worse.
<Wrek> 05i usualyl jsut use the hood on my hoodie if its too cold otuside
<Panda> I always wear mah beanie ^-^

<Wrek> 05a cold calm winter night when walkign on the road only to be lit by street lights and havign a thermos of coffe in your pocket
<Wrek> 05its awesome
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: There's a reason Minnesotans are teased about our winters, because they are true some years.
<artist> hellau everyone
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy artist!
<Vivix> Winter and streetlights give me a lot of nostalgic memories
<MadSurge> I don't need a hat, my hair is already gigantic and warm :D
<Panda> Ah minnesota!
<Vivix> I mean the sun goes down at like..3 pm 2:30 in winter?- so many school memories
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: I prefer it when it's snowing, but yes :).
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB87TndHlFg&feature=related

<Spectrum_Rush> I like winter at night, its always so bright
<Panda> Anyways, I'm gonna run some errands guys :)

<Wrek> 05or work on luna and watch mars attacks!
<Wrek> 05choices choices
<artist> work on luna then.......marsk attacks!
<artist> mars*
<Everlasting_Joy> Forgive me for never hearing of "Mars Attacks!", but that sound like something form the '60s.
<Spectrum_Rush> admit it you read it in his voice http://derpiboo.ru/130553
<Jmo> 96 Actually.
<Everlasting_Joy> Spectrum_Rush: Yes.

<Wrek> 05http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116996/
<Spectrum_Rush> Wrek: ninja'd :P
<Everlasting_Joy> Now I know :).
<Spectrum_Rush> :P
<Wrek> 05its my b movie choice so :D
*SpadeMagnes[School] breakdances
<Wrek> 05also voted the extrended cut of the abyss for A movie
<Wrek> 05that shit is 3 horus long man
<Everlasting_Joy> At least it isn't 6.
<Vivix> Ah, I have to throw stuff at the vote
<Vivix> or..lott
<Vivix> o
<Vivix> Sometimes- I miss the "edit your statement" From SO chat
<artist> i usually go at the cinema instead of watching it here :P
<artist> movies that is
<Vivix> I only really go to the cinema if there's something really good I want to see
<Vivix> which is--damn rare
<Wrek> 05artist: implying movies that are shown here air nowadays in theaters
<Vivix> ^^ that aswell
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Time travel!
<artist> Wrek: not really, but that doesnt really matter to me
<Vivix> I'm not a big movie fan, so this setting is better for me
<artist> really really really
<Vivix> walking out on a cinema would just --mortify me
<artist> why?
<artist> loud?
<artist> to loud?
<Vivix> Because I'd be..interrupting peoples viewing, and appearing rude
<artist> are you 8 feet long?
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Do you sneeze uncontrollably?
<Vivix> Luckily not, that would be-- oh the end of my cinema days
<Everlasting_Joy> Vivix: Oh come on, the critic is the best part of the flic!
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Cuz I can tell you when my mom and sister and I start laughing at something we think is funny, we get REALLY loud.
<Gold_Demona> And we go tot the cinemas all the time
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vivix> That's that's fine
<Vivix> I mean, I would feel really bad if I went to a movie, didn't like it, and walked out
<Wrek> 05or you can do what me and a coulpe of friends did
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I can tell you from experience that nobody cares if you walk out. :P
<Wrek> 05we went and saw the 3rd twilight movie in the cinema
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Did a MST3K riff?
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Everybody has their reasons for walking out, not just because of bad movie
<artist> Wrek: you stood there booing?
<Wrek> 05and we threw abcon chips on the girls in front of us each time they screeched
<Vivix> The only thing really bad is like- I saw Lord of the rings when it first came out, and a group of girls sat behind us going "EEEE" everythign Elijah Wood was on screen, and texting and playing on their phones rest of movie
<Gold_Demona> lol
<artist> thats great
<Wrek> 05halfway through they stopped
<Vivix> Yeah~~ I'd just feel bad, despite probably noone noticing
<Vivix> !
<Kammerjunk> Why do I have a 6 minute long video at 1.56 GB.
<Vivix> O wrek
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What part of turn off their phones do they not get?
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Yeah, you're supposed to turn your cell off during the movie. That's rude. :P
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: :D
<Vivix> Yeah, that was a strange situation
<Vivix> I did actually see Twilight at the cinema
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And whats so special about Elijah Wood?
<MadSurge> Wrek: you did well.
<Vivix> and was--surprised that it wasn't horrible-
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Wait, what were you doing watching Twilight?
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: I salute you for that.
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: it's the Eli in his name. makes him special
<Wrek> 05afterwards we were blockign the exit makign fun of them by saying the standard stuff in a degradign tone
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I honestly haven't read or watched Twilight. I've heard too much bad press about it. =/
<Vivix> It isn't--great, that's for sure, and it is a bad love story
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: I wish my friends were as fun to be around.
<Eli> SpadeMagnes[School]: at least i get a ping everytime someone mentiones him
<Vivix> but- it's not really worse than any of the other teen movies I've seen-
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Bella is too much of a sociopath to be enjoyed :|
<Vivix> She does look scarily unemotional
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Bella is not a protaganist
<Vivix> like she's constantly on heroin-
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Protaganists..DO SOMETHING
<Kammerjunk> Hey, I liked Pants.
<Kammerjunk> She was a... well, she was a character.
<Vivix> But honestly, it's not horrible, it's just- meh
<artist> Vivix: its just very overrated
<Vivix> I wasn't bored when watching it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And then 50 shades happened
<Vivix> yeah, that's the issue
<MadSurge> At least it's great for Rifftrax :D
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: Having watched quite a few of the newer Disney films, the live-action ones, I can agree on that.
<Vivix> Hehe
<Wrek> 05no really
<Kammerjunk> Yes really.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Orlyt
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *Orly
<Wrek> 05at once scene bella looks like an anorexic crackabuser
<Vivix> yarly
<Kammerjunk> (She is)
<Vivix> She does look constantly tripping
<Wrek> 05litterally
<SpadeMagnes[School]> At least Bella died
<Vivix> she would be a good nancy in a sex pistols movie
<Wrek> 05and we were all like "adn the girls liek this..."
<MadSurge> Wrek: but it's so romaaaaantic~ :|
*Vivix is a sucker for romance
<Vivix> buut-- it isn't really
<Wrek> 05its tragic and you should feel ashamed
*Everlasting_Joy gags. "I'm fine, I'm fine."
<Kammerjunk> Vivix: Ditto.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why are girls attacted to that garbage?
<Kammerjunk> I still read vampire books. I mean ACTUAL vampire books.
<Wrek> 05van helsign is best vampire movie
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Remember when vampires were cool...
<Kammerjunk> SpadeMagnes[School]: Two names: Justin Bieber - One Direction
<Vivix> it's-- kinda a movie more about--being messed up, and kinda choosing between two people without really --showing any romance
<naturesfury> abrahamlicon vs vamp?
<Wrek> 05no wait
<Vivix> I kinda think vampires are stupid, like- all vampires
<Wrek> 05abraham lincon the vampire hunter is best vamp movie
<Vivix> like Blades? Gaag-
<Wrek> 05second best is ban helsing
<Kammerjunk> I dunno, I liked Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Who the hell was on crack to come up with that abraham idea
<Wrek> 05what a great idea it was
<Everlasting_Joy> I find it awesome.
<puffmuffins> hi
<Wrek> 05how do you think monthy python came up with their stuff? :P
<Wrek> 05and also
<Wrek> 05without drugs
<Wrek> 05we'd have no pink floyd
<Colt_Brovakiin> :D
<Vivix> mmm~~
<Vivix> well, almost not true
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: John Cleese calls it "the creative mode".
<Wrek> 05think about that for a second
<Vivix> because of drugs we have no Syd Barrett
<Kammerjunk> Wrek: As in, they'd just sit and throw out ideas. No ideas were bad.
<Vivix> because of drugs- most bands died and sucked
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: Wasn't one of the Pythons a rabid alcoholic?
<Vivix> Yeah, the gay one
<naturesfury> think how the guys came up with mario and his universe 2
<Gold_Demona> He played Arthur in Holy Grail, right?
<Vivix> I don't think the others drank or did drugs- not sure
<Vivix> Think so-
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/9bd6c84030a7478110eb105797e4ec53.jpg Fluttershy does the shoo be doo
<Kammerjunk> Seriously, John Cleese has a brilliant view on creativity.
<Wrek> 05speaking of drugs
<Everlasting_Joy> I must depart fellow bronies. It's lunch time!
<Kammerjunk> The guy's a looney, but he's a damned good one.
<Vivix> Lunch!

<puffmuffins> hello everypony
<Wrek> 05Shizuka!
<Kammerjunk> puffmuffins: Ave.

<DaringDerpy> good evening bronystate :)
<Vivix> Mead, had that one on Larpa once
<Kammerjunk> DaringDerpy: Salve.

<Wrek> 05sjätte tunnan in stockholm is one of the few places that serve it
<Vivix> really--really sweet
<Wrek> 05good one too
<Kammerjunk> Shame it's such a 'dead' drink, that mead.
<Vivix> like flat?
<Kammerjunk> No, dead. You don't see it a lot of places.
<Vivix> Oh right, yeah
<Vivix> I dunno why, on Larpa, most of the people make it themselves
<Kammerjunk> Why are dead things always better?
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/1abbd39432b4c38ec6b8189418164188.gif OH MY GOD. THIS IS THE BEST :D
<Kammerjunk> Wait, that sounded better in my head.
<Vivix> it's not very strong- so they can do it unlicensed
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Would you like some spam?
<naturesfury> ask berrypunch
<SpadeMagnes[School]> "Do you have anything without spam in it"
<Vivix> EGGS and SPAM
<Kammerjunk> I have never had spam.
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: LOVELY SPAAAM WONDERFUL SPAAAAM
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But that still has spam in it!
<Vivix> I always thouht spam was bogskinke, turns out it's not

<MaxTheBrony> Hi :)
<MadSurge> Hey MaxTheBrony!
<J_E_Smith71> Vivix: They actually do sell that sandwhich at Universal Studios...though the stand isn't open all the time. They color the eggs using powered spinach instead of food coloring
<Vivix> Oooh
<Vivix> That actually sounds delicious
<Vivix> I haven't had spinach in ages, so I can't remember what it tastes like- but still!

<Bronysith> Saturn: how was it?
<Saturn> 08,01and now i'm having a paranoia attack
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: moral: dont drink coffee
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: yes, this
<MakerDusk> Saturn: always_watching.jpg
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<twilight_sprinkle> did i miss dari stream
<MakerDusk> o_o
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi GilDash
<Saturn> 08,01i'm also listening to Amanda Palmer again!
<Saturn> 08,01i wish i knew the songs better, because i want to sing them loudly
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya GilDash :)
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<MadSurge> Hello Saturn, Bronysith and GilDash!
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: but you were already here
<Saturn> 08,01hi MadSurge!
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: thats what you think
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: i see a "hi" 3 minutes before the one you just gave
<Saturn> 08,01methinks you were just trying to grab my attention :P
<Bronysith> methinksitwaskira
<Saturn> 08,01pfft, you always blame kira.
<twilight_sprinkle> kira is overrated
<Saturn> 08,01kira killed my goldfish
<Bronysith> deathnote is overrated
<Shizuka> 13kira killed my childhood
<twilight_sprinkle> indeed deathnote is
<Bronysith> still decent
<Saturn> 08,01the first half of deathnote is amazing
<Saturn> 08,01and it should have ended there
<twilight_sprinkle> deathnote was only not boring eps 9-25 or so
<Bronysith> people need to understand that overrated=/= bad
<Saturn> 08,01but noooo
<Bronysith> Saturn: you mean after L?
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: it should have nded when L did
<Saturn> 08,01downer ending
<Bronysith> Saturn: yea, but then it got BORING
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Bronysith> im just sitting here, dancing to fukkireta
<twilight_sprinkle> deathnote wasnt even that clever
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Just as planned
<Bronysith> it was a great idea with decent execution
<Gold_Demona> I like lots of things that're overrated. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought of kiras plan 10 eps before he did, and nothing was preventing him from doing it the (spoilers) first time mica got captured
<Bronysith> the main character is a dark one
<Bronysith> not really a hero,
<twilight_sprinkle> a dark main character isnt enough to make a good story
<Bronysith> i never said that
<Saturn> 08,01well, i enjoyed it
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I like also underrated stuff :D
<twilight_sprinkle> kira was quite empty too
<Saturn> 08,01and i'm really clever
<Bronysith> but i just think that the first half until L ended was a great little anime
<Saturn> 08,01and popular
<Snow> hello everyone? whats the subject about?
<Bronysith> Snow: Deathnote
<Jmo> Hayo Snow
<MadSurge> Hey Snow!
<Snow> :o deathnote!
<Saturn> 08,01snow!
<Bronysith> AKA one of hte most overrated animes ever
<twilight_sprinkle> deathnote actually did the "but he knows i know he knows" stuff
<Snow> meh, i watched it, it was good
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: like a teen romance novel
<Bronysith> But lets take Gurren lagann, it was a simple idea with a spectacular execution and ended how it shouldve
<Saturn> 08,01(still a better love story than twilight)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Overated isnt always a bad thing
<twilight_sprinkle> code geass is MLG
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School]: nope
<Kimori> hi blako
<twilight_sprinkle> also GITS
<Blako> hi Kimori
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: you cant deny that lelouch and Light yagami have a shit load of similarities
<Snow> twilight_sprinkle: hell yeah CG was!
<twilight_sprinkle> and the brilliantly over-the-top JOJO
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: very few actually
<Bronysith> =_=
<Bronysith> They both want to conquer
<Bronysith> they both are highly intelligent
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: wrong, lelouches goal wasnt to conquer
<Bronysith> both have power to manipulate others
<Snow> fun fact: the VA of lelouch is the same VA that did Grell in kuroshitsuji
*Saturn 08,01runs and hides from the anime
<Bronysith> Gurren Lagann is just one of the best giant mech animes out there
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: kira didnt have an actualy power to manipulate, only to kill
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: he could manipulate
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: kira was just a psychopath who wanted power, lelouche is a lot deeper
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Happily Ever After
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: nah
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: many characters are smart and can manipulate people
<Bronysith> lelouch=kira
<Snow> grell>Lelouch
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: i just told you that theyre not similar..
<twilight_sprinkle> and i explained why
<Bronysith> Simon the digger>Lelouch
<Sonny> curses!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Yawn
<Snow> nwaY
<twilight_sprinkle> i didnt like gurren lagann
<Sonny> everytime I make a commission the guy who asks me to draw him is never on xD
<Sonny> oh well
<Bronysith> code geass is so boring
<Snow> not really, you just gotta understand it
<Bronysith> thats why code ment is incredibly hilarious, he took a boring anime and made it awesomely hilarious
<twilight_sprinkle> bornismith just cant accept other views.
<Snow> LAZER ARM

<Bronysith> be a pony lol
<Snow> DISCORD FOR PRESIDENT
<Cades> hopefully it lasts a little bit longer
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I will eat my hat is obama gets elected again
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School]: ill just move out of the country
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Who the hell voted for him to begin with
<Petrified_Discord> Well, we can narrow it down to Americans
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School]: hate to sound stereotypical but blacks and people afraid of being called racists
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I mean what kind of people
<Vordox> Do like Sweden :P
<Petrified_Discord> Silly Sweden
<Vordox> A king with no power and a democracy Party selection
<Bronysith> i want to move to scotland or something
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I heard it was people who were lazy and just wanted to mooch of money
<Snow> dont vote for any of them, vote discord
<Snow> seriously.
<alexxm> did sweden vote discord president?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> As one woman said it that amused me
<Vordox> Snow: Honestly... Discord would be better :D
<Bronysith> i just want to move to somewhere in europe
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Where'd you get the money? From Obama! Where'd obama get the money? From his stash!
<Petrified_Discord> lol what? :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Some dumbass woman I forget what it was about said that
<RaveBrony> Hey everypony, nice to see the chat is flowing :P
<Petrified_Discord> Obama has money in his moustache
<Petrified_Discord> Money 'stash
<Snow> ...what moustache?
<Bronysith> http://irishpony.tumblr.com/post/34060607734/this-is-why-im-voting-for-him SpadeMagnes[School] people like this dumbass
<Petrified_Discord> Snow: EXACTLY.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What do you call people who dont bother getting a job and just vote people so they can getz"benifits?
<RaveBrony> Bronysith: Wut
<RaveBrony> I dont even
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: the person who commented on the photo said "this is why im voting for him"
<Kandarihu> And more recently, there's the whole "OBAMA PHONE" woman.
<RaveBrony> =_(\
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: the fact that he said that makes me want to murder something
<Snow> Where did discord get all that money from? his chocelate rain.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also did you hear what happened to this one guy in college?
<RaveBrony> Bronysith: You and me both... damn todays society..
<Snow> more reason for president
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: and that is the reason why our country is so stupid
<Vivix> Why should you care Bronysith?
<RaveBrony> I agree
<Vivix> Do you think your opinions make people less rage-y?
<Bronysith> Vivix: cause it is retards like that who vote for obama in the first place
<SpadeMagnes[School]> A bunch of people beat the shit out of him because he had a romney sign in his lawn
<Snow> seriously, choclate rain guys
<Snow> CHOCLATE RAIN!
<Vivix> Who gives a fuck? It's the internet
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He's ok though
<Kandarihu> I heard about that, too.
<Bronysith> Vivix: cause it affects votes IRL and why a dumbass like obama gets elected in the first place
<Petrified_Discord> If aliens ever visit earth the first thing we have to do is HIDE THE INTERNET. We CANNOT let them see what's on there.
<Vivix> I doubt that person would vote any different even without that silly comment, and I even doubt he'll vote at all
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also why does the ads for elections seem like just a bunch of slander?
<Bronysith> Vivix: well yea, hes like 13 thank god :D
<Vivix> So, why are you pissed?
<Bronysith> now lets get out of this political discussion please
<Bronysith> PLEASE
<Vivix> This isn't political, this is about judging other people
<Bronysith> lets get out of this political shit before it gets out of hand

<Alchemist> Bronysith: that of course does not include me saying I want to hurt someone.
<Vordox> Socks: How can I be wrong when I right?
<Bronysith> Alchemist: quick time events are in real life as well
<Vordox> Socks: You played the game, do you even own the game?
<Socks> No
<Socks> :P
<Jmo> I hate you.
<Socks> I'm being idiotic and fasecious, i'm sorry.
<Jmo> The Game. Ffffff
<Vordox> Socks: Welcome to "followers" in the internet
*Jmo slaps Socks
<Jmo> FFFF
<Vordox> A small hint to you socks, AND EVERYONE ELSE here.
<Alchemist> Jmo: http://derpy.me/41
<Vordox> Think, don't follow.
*Socks ow, look I've been abused enough here
<Jmo> I larv u 2 alcamast
<Alchemist> :)
<Socks> Vordox: We're part of a fandom, following is what we do
<Vordox> Socks: Really?
<Vordox> Ask this Bronystate chat that Socks.
<Vordox> Go ahead.
<Lil_B> Well finally ordered the book I need for school... for 4€... and 2 games for 30€ ... I think I can't sspenmd anymore for school now...
<Jmo> Games are educational.
<Jmo> BUY MORE.
*Panda- slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<Panda-> ^^
<Alchemist> Lil_B: A 4 euro book? sounds cheap.
<Jmo> O U Pondoo
<Bronysith> 4chan is a great site
<Rev> ^
<Panda-> no its not
<Socks> Vordox, why are you being angry at me? I merely made a judgement on a game based on opinoins of people who I have agreed with before
<Lil_B> Alchemist actually only 1 €, but 3 € for the delivery xD
<Vordox> Socks: ._.
<Alchemist> Socks: shhh, video games is srs bsns
<Vordox> Socks: Not being angry, just dissapointed in your pre opnionated propoganda information
<Bronysith> Video games are my life,
<Bronysith> deal with it
<Vordox> Opinionated
<Alchemist> Lil_B: well that was worth it :D
<Lil_B> dem Propaganda xD
<Snow> i come back after getting some hot glue on my hand and i read: 4chan is a great site...dafuuu?
<Bronysith> Snow: well it is
<Vordox> Socks: As I said, play the game
<Vordox> Then go play the old ones
<Vordox> Come back when you have a REAL opinion?
<Panda-> what game?
<Bronysith> is resident evil 2 pretty good?
<Vordox> RE6, then go play RE1 or RE2
<Lil_B> Alchemist dunno, it's 4 goddamn Euros xD it's Dürrenmats "The Physicians" or however you spell that
<Vordox> Bronysith: For it's time it was good, yes
<Vordox> And now... Yeah it still holds up, aged as heck though
<Panda-> Yeah, I wont speak here >.>
<Bronysith> Vordox: would i enjoy it if i bought it and played today?
<Vordox> Bronysith: No
*Panda- is very opinionated with video games
<Jmo> Pondoo, you shall speak~
<Vordox> Bronysith: Well, depends. :P
<Vordox> Bronysith: Why do you play games?
<Bronysith> Vordox: for fun
<Bronysith> stories
<Vordox> Bronysith: For you, what is fun?
*DaringDerpy tries to find out what you are talking about
<Vordox> Bronysith: YOu would hate old games then...
<Bronysith> Vordox: good story is a great help
<Vordox> Most old games do not have a story, or very thin
<Alchemist> Lil_B: havent heard about it.
<Bronysith> Vordox: story, good gameplay,
<SpadeMagnes[School]> <.<
<Bronysith> Vordox: i just like games man
<DaringDerpy> Vordox: old games aren't fun?
<Lil_B> ... I'm currently getting the RE6 Music Gamerip, (7 CDs worth of music xD) the Main Theme sounds like really good orchestra
<Vordox> DaringDerpy: Never said they were fun, talking about narrative. :P
<Vivix> old games are fun, but many have slim to no stories, just like Indie games
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My computer's download speed for my wow is slow
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its going like 1.14-1.49 MB a second
<Panda-> SpadeMagnes[School], its all those pandas you are downloading?
<Bronysith> Vordox: as long as it is fun, as in is it playable?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Had to reinstall the whole thing
<Panda-> aww
<Jmo> PONDOOOO
<Bronysith> Vordox: challenging?
<Panda-> yes Jmo?
<Moopy> Lefry chicken
<Jmo> i warb u
<Vordox> Vivix, DaringDerpy, Bronysith: You can't say fun, and old games can be fun, but it's narrative(The story handling) is based on challenge. :P
<Lil_B> Alchemist isn' t that famous, but it's an optional book to user in school and most people wanted it (the other choices weren't that good)
<Panda-> ^^ spluff you too Jmo
<Vordox> Look at Castlevania 1 or 2, what's the story(Not from Manual, but from the game)
<Vivix> I agree with you
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What a terrible night to have a curse
<Jmo> dawwifeelspeshul:>
<Bronysith> Vordox: is the combat and gameplay controls okay?
<DaringDerpy> Vordox: I understand. What do you think about no-rules, no-directions, no-story sandbox games?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SpadeMagnes[School]: :D YES dat Castlevania 2
<Vordox> Bronysith: No, it's very stiff, and hard, And will make you cuss due to the how the mechanics are put into the dynamic, which gives off the aestehtics of it being chalenging.
<Vordox> DaringDerpy: They are emergant Stories, or Story machines.
<Alchemist> Lil_B: Im reading it's synopsis on the wiki right now, but I have a hard time reading any book that is not a sci-fi or an educational book :D
<Panda-> hm... the normal people that I talk to arent on... guess I'll do some homework while I wait for my ride ^^
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Dwarf fortress best game ever
*ASoftFluffyThing|AFK is back
<Bronysith> Vordox: ahh okay. I like old games, like NES and SNES games
<Lil_B> Alchemist me too >.<
*Jmo boops ASoftFluffyThing
*Panda- pets ASoftFluffyThing|AFK
<ASoftFluffyThing> Anythin' streamin'?
<Vordox> Bronysith: Then you like games for their challenging aspect?
<Panda-> ASoftFluffyThing \:3/ im streaming!
<Bronysith> Vordox: yes
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Play kaizo mario them
*ASoftFluffyThing turns into a pillow for Jmo and Panda-
<DaringDerpy> for narration, we played lucasart adventure games...point and click stuff
<Vordox> Bronysith: Then why did you talk about stories before? :P
<Jmo> Huzzah.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *then
<Bronysith> Vordox: cause i like a good story too :D
<MadSurge> Bronysith: basically you have to use the option weapons to compensate for the clumsiness of the character, just like Konami wanted
<Lil_B> Panda U be streamn?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Pre-Reader Q&Neigh Numero Cuattro
<Vordox> DaringDerpy: That' a heavy adventure game textual game, that has TONS of narrative forms to fill in the story in the game with the same mechanics that been used for several eras.
<Panda-> Lil_B not really ^^ not right now at least.
<Vordox> Bronysith: Then you played mostly JRPG and RPGs?
<Moopy> yay~
<DaringDerpy> many games you would never had expected it from had awesome storylines....project nomad is nice for example
<Bronysith> Vordox: yes, also castlevania on the NES, Contra,
*Rev chews on prince-dari
<Vordox> Bronysith: Contra had a story?
<DaringDerpy> Vordox: you sound like a textbook
<Vordox> SUDDENLY ALIENS
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Voice acting isnt really necessisary for a good story
<Jmo> That Derp Roll'd.
<Bronysith> Vordox: no, lol, i just like the challenge
<Vordox> <--- Game Design student atm, DaringDerpy :P
<DaringDerpy> that explains it
<Bronysith> Vordox: but seriously, is resident evil 2 challenging?
<Vordox> I'm trying to learn to understand
<Vordox> It's HARD.
<Bronysith> LETS DO IT
<Vordox> Bronysith: Hmmm, some parts, luckily.
<DaringDerpy> play them, take the generalizations with a grain of sal
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Jill sandwich
<DaringDerpy> t
<Vordox> Bronysith: Othewise...no
<Bronysith> Vordox: and how about storywise? nothing?
<Vordox> BUT if you want a REAL good sstory(Narrative + Voice acting) go for RE1
<MadSurge> Vordox: yes, aliens invade disguised as terrorists, government sends in Rambo and the AHNOLD to kill them all :D
<Bronysith> Vordox: ahh okay
<Vordox> Bronysith: It's heavy on the story. :P
*Jmo lays on ASoftFluffyThing
<Vordox> MadSurge: *Facepalm nowadays, but back then it was FRICKING ROCKING*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Try beating contra with no continues...
<Jmo> fluffeh pilloow
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hell I dare you to beat contra with dieing!
<Vordox> At the moment, I'm studying Narrative forms of the games...
<Vordox> And looking back, HOLY SHIT the NES was masterpieces(The Good mouth to mouth games)
*ASoftFluffyThing messes up Jmo's mane
<MadSurge> Vordox: eh, if the game is good, I'm willing to ignore a bad story or a few stupid mechanics
<Vordox> Like...take for example the game... Talespin. :P
<Jmo> huzzah~
<Lil_B> Vordox play Illusion of Gaia/Time and Terranigma
<Jmo> messy mane.
<Bronysith> Vordox: i love challenging games
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im sure you enjoy Kaizo mario then
<Vordox> Lil_B: I want to play Terranigma. :( The other one I haven't heard.
<Vordox> Bronysith: You want new age Challenge games: Super MEat Boy, Dark Souls/Demon's soul.
<Bronysith> Vordox: have you played chrono trigger perhaps? i mean thats more story than challenging
<Bronysith> Vordox: already beat demons souls
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Try IWBTG
<DaringDerpy> Vordox: for my taste, the nes was to restrictive...everything was full of invisible walls and level balancing. you had to follow one line and only this one line
<Bronysith> Vordox: but i want to get into retro games
<Jmo> HOHOHOHO
<Jmo> Dark Souls
<Jmo> So fun.
<Bronysith> Jmo: /)
<Vordox> If you want story, for funsies: Hector, Puzzle Agent(FREE), if you want serious, go or Telltale other games: Walking Dead(The game) or Braid/Bastion. :P
<Vivix> I like serious games-
<Vordox> DaringDerpy: What...?
<Vivix> not fan of gameplay for the sake of gameplay games
<Jmo> y so srs Vivix.
<Vordox> DaringDerpy: You missed out on Semi Dynamic games then. :(
<Jmo> Y SO SRS
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Poyo
<Bronysith> Vordox: so resident evil 2 is more hard than anything else?
<DaringDerpy> semi dynamic
<Vivix> cuuz gaames are fuuun
<Vordox> DaringDerpy: There's plenty of Modular/Semi Dynamic games even back in NES:
*SpadeMagnes[School] does the Kirby Dance
<Lil_B> Vordox well, ok, do this , Play Soul Blazer, then Illusion of Time (trhat's the european Title) and then Terranigma (all SNES games) , they don't directlky have something to do with each other, but they are spiritual successors to oneanother
<DaringDerpy> never had an nes...didn't like the showcase games, didn't try the underdogs
<MadSurge> Vordox: it's part of a trilogy, Soul Blazer (who was a spiritual sequel to Actraiser), Illusion of Gaia, and Terranigma. Similar themes, diferent characters
<Vordox> MadSurge: <.< I played Actraiser. D:
<Vordox> Well if I ever get time...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Action 64.....
<Vordox> The thing is, Game Designers are supposed to actually SEE behind the game when playing
<MadSurge> Vordox: they're more action-based though
<Vordox> Ruin games for myself sometimes. ._.
<Vivix> So you study the design of the experience?
<Bronysith> Vordox: what kind of games are you going to make man? good and challenging i hope
<Vivix> We need more people like that
<Vordox> Vivix: Basically, yes.
<Vordox> The Experience = Aethetics.
<Lil_B> Vordox although Soul Blazer and Illusion of Gaia may have some... Game mechanics one may not like, they are good games, and I completly Adore Illusion of Time for it'sm story and generall Atmosphere threwout the game
<Vordox> Creating the game to make the player simulate THIS experience
<Vivix> That's great, I hope next gen devs will be very focused on that- experience and feel
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Up Up Down Down
<Vordox> Where THIS is where the game goes around
<Vivix> yes
<Bronysith> i play contra
<Bronysith> without the code
<Vordox> Lil_B: If I ever get the chance. :(
<Vivix> My current favourite game devs are the Overwatch team
<Vordox> Vivix: Hardly...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Can you beat it with out game overs?
<Vivix> Aww~~
<Vordox> Vivix: Well, there's been one thing you forgot.
<Vivix> Hm?
<Vordox> Vivix: The more players play games, the more arrogant they become.
<Vordox> Just look at me. :P
<Lil_B> Vordox do it when you have spare Time xD, I think yoiu are smart enough to work with Emulators xD
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vivix> That's true
<DaringDerpy> no one produces challenging mainstream games anymore...these streamlined faggots don't wear ties at presentations, because it could alienate the target audience....how could they make a challenging game
<Vordox> "I don't like this mechanics, I do not like this menu, I do not like this system" etc etc.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I play alot of game and I an not arrogant
<Vivix> It's true, but the mechanics is one thing
<Vordox> "What if they change this here to this here?"
<Vordox> Vivix: No, that's the fun part. :)
<Vivix> I think- most indie games try to change mechanics to a point where they are just a bunch of tech demos-
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Insert Tv tropes"They changed it now it sucks"
<Vordox> There's a system game designer use, Called MDA, Mechanics, Dynamics and Aesthetics.
<alexxm> what changed
<Vivix> mechacnis are important, but sometimes- they really do change something that maybe shouldn't have been changed. in other cases- like walking dead game, it can create a cool new feeling
<Bronysith> i think most mainstream game designers are making games too easy
<Vordox> All are intertwined(If a game is created correctly), so there's never "This one here"
<Vivix> true-
<Vordox> Of course... we have the famous "Flow breaker"...
<Vivix> I admire gamedevs- but it's not a profession for me
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And sometimes its the same now its sucks
<Vordox> Like for example, if you played RE6, you sometimes have cutscenes or scripted events.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fanbases are too finicky
<Vordox> IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT with a zombies
<Vivix> diidn't play, but yeah
<Jmo> Out of all the games, RE6 o.o
<Vivix> yeah breaks the flow or --situation, so to speak
<Vordox> It's like "OH FUCK OH FUCK, I WILL KILL YOU A*Scene starts* Oh I got to wait..............*OKAY I AM BAC WTF THEY HIT ME DURING THE CUTSCENE; FUUUUDGE"*
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Mood whiplash!
<Floris> Why, oh why
<Vivix> I prefer games like- okay, dishonored and valve, almost no-- breaks from the movements, it feels solid
<Floris> Am I always so slow.
<Vivix> of course, that's- yeah a preference
<Vordox> Vivix: Hub?
<Jmo> Cause you're in the matrix.
<Vordox> Vivix: Heard plenty of bad things about the Hub. :P
<Vivix> the hub?
<Vordox> Vivix: How it breaks the flow, but I haven't played it yet
<Floris> I just traded with a fellow brony on TF2 and found out about the season 3 premiere.
<Vordox> Where you choose, basically, the World.
<Vivix> ohh
<Jmo> Oh boy that is slow.
<Vordox> Welcome then Floris. :D
<Vivix> in Dishonored? Well- it's kinda like a broken eh "select mission" thing
<Vordox> Oh...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Some one clearly doesnt browse EQD
<Vordox> Vivix: Those are dangerous to use. :P
<Vivix> but--it works well enough
<Floris> [20:38:02] Floris Kunst: and the reemergence of a certain unnamed fan favorite villain
<Vivix> yeah, but--it works better as a non select mission, and just as a resting point to get the narrative in
<Vordox> Vivix: Suprisingly, you're a sponge for opinions and knowledge...
<Vordox> Interesting...
<Vordox> You know about it, and you can communicate about it...
<Vordox> COmpared to me. :D
<DaringDerpy> I thought this villian thing was just a rumour
<Jmo> Mah sponge.
<Vivix> Hehe, I tend to like snapping up things and analyzing them on the fly
<Vordox> Vivix: Try to pick down a game
*Jmo squeezes Vivix
<Vordox> What works, what does not.
<Vivix> sometimes that makes me say really uneducated guesses, but- just how it is
<Vivix> Hmm-
*Vivix cuddles Jmo
<Vordox> Vivix: Take your favourite game.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I really should play Skyward sword again...
<Jmo> Hello Kitty Online.
<Vordox> ...
<Vordox> Lol Jmo
<Jmo> :>
<Vordox> You serious...?
<Jmo> lolno
<Vivix> Okay- that's a hard one, probably lets say half life universe now
<Vordox> Thank Celestia. :D
<Jmo> Played that shit for 5 minutes and cried after.
<Vordox> Vivix: Ah no, only one game, not the whole franchise. :P
<Vivix> but I recently played Dishonored- so picking down that would be easier
<Vordox> Ok, take Dishonoured
<Vordox> (Spoiler free as well)
<Vivix> Okay yeah-
<Vordox> I have not played the game, so let's begin with one thing...
<Vordox> What feelings did you get?
<Vordox> What did the game "Give" for Experience?
<Jmo> Are you charging per hour for this?
<Vivix> Beauty, and art. More so than a captivating story
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What is this therapy?
<Vordox> Steampunk world, with robots?
<Lil_B> I'm currently play Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams, I hope it has a hrad mode later
<Lil_B> hard*
<DaringDerpy> Remember the old games that had the whole narrative stuff in one "xy-pedia" and in item and tech descriptions? xcom, civilization, alpha centauri? it was more than enough to keep one playing.
<Vordox> True, a new world, new experience and sights = Exploration and Mystifications.
<Vivix> Kinda- it's more like, eh 1700s france with magic and steampunk, whith a strange mix of tech
<Lil_B> but I have to turn the Grafics down or I have to play the game in Slo Mo :P#
<Vordox> Vivix: Sounds good.
<Vordox> But still apply to what I said.
<Vordox> It gave you a new world to explore with "new" things, that you may wonder how they work.
<Vivix> yes, it feels very fresh, and beautiful. And the way the controls feel, solid and to the point, even the ledge mechanics, make the world feel solid and open, despite being linear
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is it normal for me when I have a strategy guide to a new game I ignore the guide and figure things out my self and read it later?
<Vivix> yes
<Vordox> Vivix: Wait, how is the controlls different compared to any other FPS?
<Vivix> New experiences, sights, and lore
<Vivix> They're not, really, but it's a UDK game, that for me personally, tend to feel distant to details, and it felt more like a source game with a closeness to details. Adding few playerclips and many alternate reutes make the world feel solid, open, yet linear
<DaringDerpy> they deliver you the strategy guide ingame now. forced tutorial, forced hints, etc
<Vordox> Alright, so it's a Semi Dynamic choice
<Vivix> yeah, and the details felt up close, rather than "view only"
<Vordox> You have 2+ routes to go through the game, but you still go together once again later on back into the story
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Not every game...
<Vordox> There's 4 Narrative story routes.
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/54571eb93355d01a0490f0601cb769d6.jpg Not enough Pinkie, but CLOSE ENOUGH <3
<Vordox> Modular(Hubs, Stage select etc), Linear, Semi Dynamic and fyll Dynamic.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I dont mind tutorials but all the incentive I need is gear and objective, go do
<Vordox> And a special narrative, called a Story Machine(SIMS, MInecraft etc)
<Vivix> Yeah,
<Everlasting_Joy> All right, I'm going to take off.
<Vordox> So I assume it's a modular Hybrid with Semi Dynamic routes...
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: later bro
<Vordox> Sounds good enough.
<Vivix> kind of, the modular is-- kind of down, you know? I don't think its a good feature
<Vordox> O.o
<Vivix> the HUB is--a resting point between "missions"
<Vivix> to catch up on the main storyline, and--upgrade, rest, relax
<Vordox> How does it feel "off?"
<Vivix> when you've completed the game, you can select missions in the main menu, but rather than work like--a hub, it's like a savegame on each chapter
<Vordox> Somehinglike Catherine?
<Vivix> so it feels like an intended hub, without acting as a mission select, as it is also part of the main storyline
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Hey listin
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *listen
<Vivix> Never played Catherine- but maybe
<Vordox> Okay, like Megaman? :P
*Bronysith suplexes SpadeMagnes[School]
<Vivix> <,< never played that either-
<Jmo> >_>
<Vordox> Take this mission/stage, complete, back to Stage Select.
<Vordox> Super Mario Bros...?
<Vivix> <,<
<Jmo> Oh
<Jmo> god
<Jmo> Just
<Jmo> REALLY?
<Vivix> I was not a nintendo kid <,<
<Vivix> but no eh--
<Vordox> Okay, okay....
<Jmo> I will beat you with soap.
<Vordox> Hmm. Like Donkey Kong?
<Lil_B> Vordox how High did you get?
<MadSurge> Vivix: I liked Catherine :D
<Vordox> Lil_B: On what? :P
<Lil_B> Vordox the building of course
<Vordox> Vivix: How about Little Big Planet?
<Vivix> Hehe, I think it's a mission hub in the game's storyline, but not in the game mechanics. That makes me feel like I expect to be able to start there and pick what missions I'd like, but I can't
<Vordox> Lil_B: What building? O.o
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You got Rush Jet!
<Vivix> I have played LBP, but long time ago-
<Vordox> Vivix: Oooh
<Vordox> I see what you mean.
<Lil_B> Vordox Donkey Kong... think good and think long about it
<Vordox> Lil_B: I complete all of them. :P
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> SpadeMagnes[School]: lol Megaman 2?
<Vordox> Vivix: So it's basicaclly just arest place, with only ONE route to go after being there?
<Vivix> MadSurge, I never tried it, but I thin kwe talked about it a long time ago here?
<Dken2021> evening paizanos
<Lil_B> Vordox I'm taslking about the Arcade Donkey Kong... !
<Vordox> Lil_B: Oh god... I don't remember. :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh Bubble man you suck
<Vordox> Lil_B: Same as I do not remember Bubble Bobble
<Vivix> yeah, basically. You have the option to upgrade, or mess around in that area, but you have to go wiht the linear story
<MadSurge> Vivix: yep
<Vordox> Vivix: Odd choice..
<Lil_B> Vordox dude, I'm 20, I'm younger than you!
<Vordox> Vivix: Like being full freedom but then ravaged of it, and then you're forced into a smaller area.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> is there no stream yet?
<Vivix> yeah- it kinda makes sense for the story, but--it did feel odd when combined with the mission select in the main menu
<Vordox> Lil_B: So? XD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I think you guys might be looking too deep into it
<Vordox> Vivix: Basically, you wanted the same feature as the main menu but in your hub?
<Vordox> Odd change.
<Vivix> Kinda, I wanted to replay missions with different loadouts, jsut to have fun
<Dken2021> so what are ya talking bout?
<Vivix> but instead it loads a save with what I st arted with at that mission start
<Lil_B> Vordox I think I lost the Point I was going to make somewhere on the way, stay tunes while I'm twatching for it
<Vordox> Sounds greedy. :P
<Vivix> Hehe
<Lil_B> saty tuned*
<Vordox> Lil_B: Will wait.
<Bronysith> :p
<Vordox> Vivix: That's the thing...
<Lil_B> ... JonTrons NightShade "Review" ended... unexpected
<Vivix> But yeah, I think it comes down to the hub not being a mechanic hub, but a story-point and rest area for a certain part of the game
<Vordox> Vivix: What happens in the hub?
<Vordox> Anything related to the story(Random NPC talk etc)
<Vivix> yeah, it's--closure on the mission, narrative and what happens next, optional upgrade of equipment, talk to minor npcs, and get set up for the next mission
<Vordox> So it's not a static room, eh...
<Vordox> Hmmm.
<Vordox> What makes it feel odd if it has a purpose for the story?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Daaw dat FlutterSsassin :D http://sunnyrays.deviantart.com/art/Fluttershy-Assassin-268681180
<Vivix> it acts as your--bedroom, you sleep between missions- it gives a sense... of belonging I guess
<Dken2021> Sketch_Toku_Brony d'aww
<Vordox> Vivix: Is the Hub your home?
<Vordox> Vivix: Like litterally?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh for the love of god....
<Vivix> eh- kind of, can't say too much without spoilers on that
<Vivix> but it acts as one yes
<Vivix> I think the reason it felt odd, is because it can be reminiscent of other games with a more stage select hub, which makes you expect certain thigns that don't happen
<Vordox> Vivix: And that's the thing I always get back to :P
<Vordox> Vivix: Arrogance, and spoiiled.
<Vivix> I can't go into the other part without spoilering-
<Vivix> Yeah
<Vordox> I know, I understand what you mean
<Bronysith> and now sad de lancie
<Vivix> Once you get used to something, or fond of something, you generally want more of it
<Bronysith> :(
<Vivix> Thing is- I'm not especially fond of mission select, but it reminded me of mission select
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story: Let's Find You a Date! (Update Complete!)
<MadSurge> I wish there was a stream :(
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates October 24th (Afternoon)
<Lil_B> got the ANNO 2070 Add-On , ANNO Add-ones are some of the rare add ons that actually give you enough new contend for the additional prize
<Dken2021> two links in a few seconds? boy they work fast
<Vordox> Vivix: Bad habit there...
<Vordox> The more you get stuck on "easy" quirks..
<Vordox> The less you appreciate the games
<Bronysith> wow, that season finale
<Bronysith> fuck
<Vordox> Even if they are good or bad.
<Vivix> Well, I loved the game
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Are you two seriously still on that?
<Vivix> but it's a thing that as a designer, one usually watches out for
<Bronysith> holy fuck
<Bronysith> BBL everypony, going to guild
<Sonny> ciao
<Sonny> Heya everypone ;)
<Dken2021> laters, enjoy youself
<Dken2021> yo Sonny
<Sonny> Nittany here ye-
<Sonny> mmmh
<Sonny> guess he's not...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH8mQRXemuo Needs more mario
<Vordox> Vivix: We can't add everything to each game. :ÖP
<Vivix> Nono, of course not
<Vordox> Vivix: That's what the indie market is trying to do as well.
<Vordox> Trying to pull the mechanics away from the mainstream gaming.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Anyway.....
<Vordox> See it as EA is your nice uncle giving you all you got, but your father pulling your money so you can't get the fun games anyway. :D
<Vivix> I'm not sure if my point came across, it's nothing wrong with the design there, it's a very enjoyable game, but things are pointed out for the sake of discussion
<Vordox> okay, bad analogy
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vordox> Vivix: Discussion is always fun
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Trying to use EA in a good anology the fuck?
<Jmo> NEEEERDS
<Vivix> Yeah, analyzing or--whatevering
<Jmo> :?>
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: EA isn't bad.
<Vordox> Well, game wise...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Right....
<Vordox> COmpany wise however... >.>
<Vordox> Well I do not know the full facts.
<Vivix> They're loosing money, so they need to make money
<Vivix> So- that makes consumers angry
<Vordox> Vivix: *Looks at Modern Warfare and Star Wars* What you talking about?
<Vivix> I think someone pointed ou their netloss
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No its the way they pull bullshit is what makes cosumers angry
<Vordox> Highest Selling game of all time. :P
<Vivix> productions costs and maintenance costs overgoing the income of their games
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Again ME3 for example
<Vivix> I didn't like ME2
<taoumi> inking luna's coat is hard. she's so dark
<Vivix> so never tried ME3
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: What's wrong with ME3?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The ending majorly
<taoumi> the ending Vordox
<Vordox> Seriously? This again?
<Jmo> lololol
<Jmo> I love when this pops up.
<Vordox> Okay, I'll make it short
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Morning everypony :)
<Vordox> The original ending was sparse, to give players freedom of thought
<Vordox> HOWEVER
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi NewSuperBronyU~
<Lil_B> good evening NewSuperBronyU :)
<Vordox> People were too narrow minded and concieved the ending as "lackluster" as the creators of the game was too "nice" to the players. :P
<Vivix> I didn't see the ending
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Bullshit
<Vordox> Vivix: I've checked into it.
<Vivix> But- I got it reiterated, was it that bad?
<Vordox> It's not bullshit SpadeMagnes[School] .
<Vordox> Vivix: It's not bad, just very...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The ending dont change a damn thing except for the color at the end
<Vordox> Well, you remember the ending of FFVII?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> :O man S3 looks like its gonna be awesome~
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: Wrong. :P
<Vivix> Sometimes endings are just that, and ending
<Vivix> an*
<Jmo> inb4 he hasn't played FFVII
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well people want closure to those kinds of games
<Vordox> Be nice Jmo . :
<Vordox> :P
<Jmo> <.<
<Vivix> I thought ME1 ending was horribly cheesy, still liked the game
<Jmo> Neva.
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: That is true.
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: But if you want an open closure, it's a choice they made.
<Jmo> Vivix is a gaming newbie. D:
<Vivix> ;D
*Jmo slaps Vivix with soap
<Vordox> Jmo: So? He still has a brain in his head. :P
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vordox> I respect that, gaming experience whatnot
<Jmo> There is no brain there. Tis a lie.
*Vivix hugs Jmo
<taoumi> but Vordox ff7 did present you with a choice pretending that it would change something then not change a damn thing. all it did was .... this happend
<taoumi> didn't*
<Vivix> My brain was lost to ponies and goaticorns
<Vordox> taoumi: Really? The ending with Midgar?
<Jmo> Frekin Goaticorns.
<Vordox> It ended EXACTLY the same as ME3. :P
<Vivix> but "this ahpepned" Is that a bad ending?
<Vordox> Yet I do NOT hear a single bad mouthing FFVII.
<Vivix> it's a common ending in books and stories- "This happened, and it changed nothing"
<Vordox> Which makes me just sick that people complained.
<Vordox> Vivix: Correct.
<Vivix> Sometimes- that's really cool
<Vordox> HOWEVER Vivix ...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What also bothers me is there is no everyone survives ending
<taoumi> yeah. it riped apart midgar. but saved the planet. Vordox . and advent chidren cleaned that up nicely
<Vordox> There was ONE thing that pissed everyone off..
*Vivix disclaimer: did not play ME3
<Lil_B> Vordox what are you studying again? you have been talkinmg and kinda lacturing about Video Games for at least 20 solid minutes :P
<Jmo> It was the goat.
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: What...? Go play it again, NOW
<Vivix> mm?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Everyone in the fucking galaxy dies one way or the other
<Vordox> Lil_B: Game Design student and studying...well...What makes good games. :D
<Saturn> 08,01bleh
<Saturn> 08,01tired
<Vordox> Hai Saturn .
<Jmo> You're always tired Saturn :P
<Saturn> 08,01hi hvordox
<Vordox> Vivix: As I said, there was ONE thing that made people anry
<Saturn> 08,01that's because i don't sleep sensibly
<Jmo> So very anry.
<Vordox> Vivix: It was promised by the creators of the game that they had 3 varying story endings.
<Lil_B> hi Saturn :)
<Vordox> Vivix: With very distinct difference.
<Dken2021> did you put on your wizard hat on the wrong way Saturn?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I like endings where I feel good about my choices
<ASoftFluffyThing> hi Saturn
<Vivix> Ooh... was, that where they split them off?
<taoumi> it was quite distint. it have 3 very dofrent colors
<Vordox> Vivix: First original ending did not have that, they had 3 change per ending, but none of them were "big"...(Which is ironic, depending on what happened exactly to Shephard)
<Saturn> 08,01hey Lil_B!
<Saturn> 08,01Dken2021: i wore it on my bum
<Saturn> 08,01and sat on my face
<Saturn> 08,01it was horrible
<Dken2021> XD
<Jmo> o.O
<Vordox> Vivix: So yeah, Shephard has 3 choices, and each one does omethingto Shephard, HOWEVER.
<Vivix> SpadeMagnes[School], look at fallout endings, your actions kinda change nothing, you just.. in fallout1 you even get kicked out and forced to leave
<Ryunosuke> who sat on saturns face?
<Vivix> Hm?
<Vordox> Vivix: There was a HUGE war effort(See it as Quests) that would change the ending... it didn't.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Again either you kill them all via molecular vaporasation or something, turning them into cyborgs, or just blowing the galaxy up
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: ...spoiler.
*Vordox gives a hard slap on top of SpadeMagnes[School] 's head.
<Jmo> LOL
<Jmo> pwnd
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Jmo> Spoilers4lyf
<Vivix> okay, so the quests was not affecting the ending at all, but your last choice did?
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: And funnily.. 2 of the endings you said are wrong. :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I want a god damn endign where everyone doesnt fucking die
<Vordox> Vivix: Yes, hard choice ending.
<Vivix> Ah-
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: There as ONLY One choice that killed off everyone. :P
<Vordox> In the extended ending atleast.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im pretty sure the other two choices were just as bad
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: Wrong, one of them gives hope, the other 2 just "Wowss" you in the extended ending.
<Vordox> HOWEVER; Let's get back to Original ending.
<Vordox> There was 3 choices there, where Shephard ... gets something from the story.
<Vordox> And they are REALLY different.
<Vordox> You know what i mean SpadeMagnes[School] :P
<Vordox> How do I explain this without spoilers...
*Jmo slaps Vordox
<Vivix> Okay- hm
<Jmo> BE A MAN
<Vivix> Hehe
<Snow> Vordox: Look a moose!
<Vivix> O Jmo, don't make my goaticorns touch you
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Like a raging fire?
<Jmo> Oh god no
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Swift as a coursing river?
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: There WAS 3 differences for each ending...
<Jmo> I will murder them with my bare hands.
<Vivix> !
<Vordox> 1 of them is BIG, the other 2 are DAMN.
<Vivix> I will cry, for ever
<Jmo> Like I care :P
<Vivix> ;__;
<Jmo> You already cry enough to me.
<Vordox> DAMNIT; is it okay if I spoil the original endings, chat?
*Vivix holds and cries
<Vivix> I don't mind
<Snow> when forced to tell spoilers, say Look a moose!
<Jmo> I wouldn't care.
<Dken2021> 130938?
<Vivix> <!DOCTYPE spoilers>
<Vordox> Okay, spoilers incoming(Original atleast)
<Sonny> I'm bored but I don't feel like doing anything
<MadSurge> Vordox: I don't really care about Mass Effect. Go on
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: There was 3 ways Shephard could die. :P
<Vivix> Yeah, I've seen one on a joke site
<thelonepony> Hi everypony :(
<Vordox> Explosions, Vaporization, or Inoculated.
<thelonepony> :)*
<Dken2021> ello thelonepony
<Vordox> Which way would you go?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> None of those ways
<Vordox> For most people, thisis just "graphics", Vivix .
<Vivix> I'd be a total asshole, ad cut to black, cause you died. And the art lover in me would love that
<Vivix> but--closure
<Vordox> Vivix: It was a closure, you died in any of the choices.
<Vivix> Okay, so at the end you get to choose those three things, no matter what earlie choice?
<Vordox> Vivix: Yes.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why cant we have a endign where we dont die
<Ryunosuke> i would take the James Kirk way out, there is no such thing as a no-win scenario :)
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: There is
<Vivix> Oh I mean, closure based on my last decision, I would kinda like it if you never knew the results of your action
<Vordox> A seond, Vivix, Let me link you to the original 3 endings.
<Vivix> Ohkay
<Vordox> That gives you a better view on what I will try and convey
<Vordox> And you take a peek at it too SpadeMagnes[School] :P
<MadSurge> Vordox: shame you get railroaded on the same 3 endings regardless of what you did
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Thats one thing that annoys me all your choices in the last two games mean nothing
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmXGAtjv5aQ <--. Original endings
<Vordox> MadSurge: Why is that shame?
<Jmo> You're going to hell Vordox.
<Jmo> You spoiler.
<Jmo> :<
*Vivix watches
<thelonepony> ow so you guys where talking about mass effect...
<Vordox> MadSurge: Sure, it's NOT what was promised, but I think I see how it was originally thought
<Vivix> I always played as a woman in games like that
<Snow> hmm spoilers...
<Vordox> thelonepony: No. :P
<Snow> im going for the moose.
<Vordox> It's ONLY spoilers if you CLICK the link
<Jmo> Ahahaha you woman.
<thelonepony> I Knew That >_>
<Jmo> You made me click the link.
<Snow> *walks to the moose*
<Vivix> immortal missionguy
<MadSurge> Vordox: because I'd like to have an ending based on what I did. I want to drag to hell the universe, not some nobody with mechasquids :D
<Vordox> MadSurge: What was your original choice?
<MadSurge> Vordox: Infamous 2 did a pretty good job at that
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Whats the point of makeing moral decisions in a trilogy when they mean nothing in the end?
<Vivix> fully dynamic endings are difficult, fallout uses flags to chop it into parts, not 100% accurate
<MadSurge> Vordox: nothing, I just read stuff online :P
<kidzrul434> i hate my life
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: I can agree with that.
<Vordox> MadSurge: Oh. :P
<thelonepony> why kidzrul434 :(
<kidzrul434> I just came home from school and what's the point?
<kidzrul434> School is a waste of time
<Dken2021> kidzrul434 you live to see another day
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: Was the child at the end only shown if you did all side quests?
<thelonepony> talk with us? :3
<Jmo> Oh boy another school complainer.
<Dken2021> kidzrul434 plus school helps you get jobs surprisingly
<MadSurge> Vordox: did you play Infamous?
<kidzrul434> What's the point? You're just going to forget about everything
<Vordox> MadSurge: Nope. :P
<Vordox> kidzrul434: Really?
<Vordox> kidzrul434: I MISS School.
<Vivix> School
<Vivix> I miss it too
<Vordox> Why you think I go in university atm. :
<Vordox> :P
<MadSurge> Vordox: it's a pretty good sandbox series
<Dken2021> yea, I miss the social aspect of schools
<Vordox> MadSurge: I know, heard and seen gameplay of it.
<Jmo> Cuz yer a nerd verdex.
<Jmo> :>
<Vivix> I miss learning and assignemnts too
<Vivix> that and goaticorns
<Jmo> Oh god you will burn Vivix.
<Vivix> ;D
<MadSurge> Vordox: and the second game carries over bonuses if you did the previous game's endings
<MadSurge> Nothing gamebreaking, mind you
<Vivix> You know what I like? Cyoa-
<Dken2021> Cyoa?
<Vordox> Vivix: Keep watching :P
<Vordox> Try to skip to where you have a choice
<Vivix> I don't know what game has my favourite ending- I don't --know
<Vordox> Vivix: That's where the hard choice is
<Vivix> ah yes
<Vivix> I'm watching it at the moment
<Vordox> My favourite ending? Nier Ending D
<Vordox> Best ending EVER
<Vivix> CYOA is Choose your own adventure
<Vordox> You want a closure, THAT is a closure, SpadeMagnes[School] :p
<Jmo> Lawl
<Vivix> I spent most of music college playing CYOA games, loved them, so much
<Dken2021> ah
<MadSurge> Vordox: :$ agreed
<Vordox> MadSurge: Played Nier? :P
<MadSurge> Vordox: yesh
<Vordox> MadSurge: Props to you for finding the under the radar game.
<Vordox> MadSurge: Do not spoil it for the others. :P It's a thing you have to live through, not read or spoil yourself if interested.
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: Spadey? You there?
<Vivix> What kind of game is that?
<MadSurge> Vordox: I was in britain and I got that, Infamous 2 and Henry Hatsworth for the DS
<Jmo> I've wanted to look at Nier but it's banned in Aussie.
<Jmo> QQ
<Vordox> Vivix: What is Nier... Where to begin..
<MadSurge> Jmo: I can link you a REALLY good LP of it
<Vordox> Vivix: Third Person Touhou with Easy DMC controlls?
<MadSurge> Jmo: screenshots though
<Vordox> MadSurge: You spoiling the game? ;_; IMPORT it Jmo !
<Jmo> I mean on digital distrubtion.
<Vordox> If you can play PAL or NTSC. :P
<Jmo> I could get it physically easily.
<Jmo> but I love my digital >_>
<Vordox> Jmo: It's not on PC I think
<Jmo> distribution*
<Jmo> Oh so it isn't, the hell?
<MadSurge> Vordox: I want to play Drakengard too, no matter how bad it is :D Cavia are the best trolls
<Lil_B> Nier looks strange whenever I look at it, but the music is so damn sweet <3
<Jmo> Thought it was. ;______;
<Vordox> MadSurge: I missed that series as well...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Oh Dark Id's Lp is hilarious
<Kandarihu> Ooh, Free weekend of Left 4 Dead 2 starts tomorrow. I'm preloading
<Vordox> Lil_B: Give the game a play... litterally. :P
<Jmo> Cbf getting a console again. Eh
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Yes, the music is awesome :3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Drakengard!
<Vivix> Tohou...
<Vivix> oh god I'm so far out on the gaming scene
<Vivix> what the hell is that
<Snow> did anyone say Touhou?
<Vordox> Vivix: Bullethell game
<Lil_B> Vordox I play PC and Nintendo, now way for me to get it :P
<Vivix> ahh--
<Dken2021> it's like bullet hell with an all girl cast
<Vordox> Lil_B: ._. dang
<Snow> Touhou!
<Vivix> ah- probably not for me then
<Vordox> Vivix: NONO
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God damn it these new glasses suck
<Snow> i enjoy the *** outa that game
<Vordox> Vivix: Don't get me wrong, it's not super hard. :P
<MadSurge> Vordox: that game is off-the-wall insane in the story department. Especially ending D and E
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: I asked you before Spades.
<Vivix> Hehe, but it's more challenge based than...
<Wrek> 05(if you're a watcher of my da than you might wanna read the latest note there...)
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: If you got all the sidequests done, you saw the child at the end, or was that auto?
<Vivix> you know?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have no idea
<Dken2021> Vivix the fandom has made other genres like mario or castlevania mixed with touhou
<Jmo> Dat art stream.
<Vordox> Vivix: It's not a hard game. :P
<Vordox> Vivix: If you like story, PLAY IT
<Vivix> okay-
<Vordox> Vivix: DOne iwth the 3 endings?
<Lil_B> Wrek dat Livestream...
<Vivix> I love stories, that's about the main reason I play
<Vivix> not yet, firsto ne now I think-
<MadSurge> Wrek: why not streaming art here :(
<Lil_B> Wrek but clever way to go around the advertisement rule
<Vordox> Vivix: you can fast forward once that's done, you'l see the small changes.
<Vordox> MadSurge: So MadSurge ...
<Vordox> MadSurge: How many times you cried? :P
*Vivix does so
<MadSurge> Vordox: not once, but sad yes :(
<Vivix> Tohou is sad?
<MadSurge> Vivix: Nier is sad
<Vivix> ohh
<Vordox> Vivix: No Nier is.
<Vivix> I like sad-
<Vivix> lurve it
<Vordox> MadSurge: You remember 2:e playthrough
<Vordox> OH MY GOD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My mom and dad say to worry about school work and we'll get it done, meanwhile I have 3 quizes in Pre calculus to do a lab,a quiz and a 2 part unit test to do
<Lil_B> ... I wanna fix my Majoras Mask Remix, but I think I'll have to rework the big Clockwork sounds :/
<Vordox> LIKE ARE YOU F*CKIGN SERIOUS feeling
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *not
<Vivix> I kinda like feeling like I'm reading a book, BUT, I also like just--playing a game
<Vordox> Vivix: Then get Nier :P if you have an Xbox or PS3
<MadSurge> Vordox: I was kinda suspicious... saw it coming :D
<Vivix> damn...
<Vivix> I don't
<Vordox> MadSurge: Even the wolf...?
<Jmo> Can I play Nier on my NES?
<Jmo> i wna pway it on da nes
<Dken2021> SpadeMagnes[School] don't you just love parents that think that way?
<Vordox> Jmo: Sadly no XD
<Jmo> ;__;
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Sigh..its two thirty and I still havent gotten anything done
<Jmo> Not even the C64?
<Jmo> Stoopid game.
<MadSurge> Vordox: I didn't saw the secret documents twist coming :D
*Panda|Homework slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My dad being off a week and working a week is goign to fuck up my school scedual
<Jmo> omai.
<Vivix> okay now I've seen the endings
<Vordox> Vivix: And you saw the 3 changes right?
<Vordox> Name them ontop of your head if you can
<Vivix> I think so yeah
<Vordox> You can join in too SpaceTransitPony
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: *
<Jmo> ROfl
*Jmo sits on Panda|Homework
<Vivix> so hard question-
<Jmo> Nuuu
<Vordox> Vivix: Not really. :P
<Vordox> Shephard's Death, Repear's changes, and Colour
<Vivix> colours..-
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> but--
<Vivix> that's it?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I swear you guys are the only thing keeping me from going fucking insane with all this school bullshit
<Vordox> Yes, that is it. Rest is the same.
<MadSurge> Vivix: YEP
<Panda|Homework> anyone here taken the class "Research Methods"?
<Jmo> <--
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: If you need help, ask.
<GilDash> Nope.
<Vordox> Vivix: But that's the thing...
<GilDash> I can't research anything for shit. XD
<Jmo> One method, to rule them all.
<MadSurge> Hello GilDash! :$
<Vordox> That's the endings, what do you think of them Vivix ?
<Jmo> Praise Google.
<GilDash> Oh, and holla all again. :)
*Lil_B hugs GilDash
<Vivix> I dunno- honeslty, I don't know
<Jmo> Hai GilDash
<Panda|Homework> Jmo, not schoolarly enough >.>
<Jmo> Pffft
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The only course I dont fucking hate is my 3d art class
<Vivix> mainly because, I don't have any loose ends to tie up, or emotion invested in the game
<Jmo> Screw your school.
<Vivix> they just feel like three different endings with little meaning to me
<Vordox> Vivix: That's the thing.... For most, it was "Too little" too late in the game.
<Vivix> they are--crazy similar though
<Vivix> ah-
<GilDash> Google is good. Can always give you ideas for other things to research.
<Vivix> I can imagine it being so, but as I haven't playedi t, yeah
<MadSurge> Vivix: the fans got REALLY angry at them
<Vordox> According to most opinions atleast.
<Dken2021> ohai GilDash
<Jmo> Google is Satan.
<Vordox> Vivix: But honestly... If you die, that's a closure, isn't it? XD
<Vivix> Depends-
<GilDash> Obviously papers and books are your best resource, but if you don't know what to look for that'll be a problem.
<Vordox> BUt people want to SeE what happend AFTEr you death.
<Vivix> closure is when your questsions feel answered and complete
<Vordox> Juxtapose much, gamerS?
<Vivix> buuut
<Vivix> I kinda like the idea of you dying
<Vivix> and never knowing the rsult
<Vivix> result*
<MadSurge> Vordox: which Nier level's theme was the best for you? :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wish my courses were easy enough to figure out on my own
<Jmo> NeEdS mOrE CaPs
<Vordox> Vivix: Same.
<Vivix> woops
<Jmo> <.<
<Vordox> MadSurge: Hmmm... I like the Shadowlord one... or Mechadump
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I can hardly understand most of the shit I'm supposed to be learning in Pre Calc
<Vivix> some of my favourite games, and favourite books, have endings that are really vague or open
<Vordox> Vivix: Same here, I've been near death once in a mile. :P I agree with you
<Vordox> Vivix: But as people said, they spent 100+ hours in this game franchise...
<Vordox> And they wanted still more.
<Vivix> true- I can see... why I guess
<Vordox> For such an ending, choosing your death...
<Vivix> but it's more the why because of the promising
<MadSurge> Vordox: YESH :$ I love The Wretched Automatons!
<Vordox> And that little change(Little as in visual, NOT in thought)
<Vivix> if there had been no promises, would people complain?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well if your gonna make so many moral choices and have it not pay off...
<Vordox> Vivix: Most likely.
<Vivix> Hm..
<Jmo> Needs more V.
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: You hated the original endings....
<Jmo> Oh I love you both. Like a resemblence of V Energy Drink.
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: Why? Cause of so small difference?
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: And not being paid of for what you did in the game, (War effort etc)
<Vivix> I think, maybe, if the moral choice was not visible, it would go down better
<SpadeMagnes[School]> That and the fact no matter what choices you make you still have the same three endings
<Vordox> I see 3 tottally different endings really.
<Jmo> Time to roll out.
<Vordox> BUT I see it not from the game, but from myself.
<Vivix> I think one of the best moral grey ever designed was Fallout Van Buren, and it was never even completed
<MadSurge> Oh Vooooordox~ http://i.imgur.com/OGZqb.png
<Vordox> I see one ending, where they all work together to live, this has some BIG changes for everyone.
<Vordox> I see one ending, where Reaper as killed out, and the rest survivors have to survive based on this, Krollians or whatever they were called had to try and live with the one that control them etc et, It'll be freedom choice.
<Vordox> The last ending, is where they just... go off.
<Vordox> That's... not much that difference really XD
<MadSurge> Vordox: too bad it's all implied :I
<Vivix> but if it weren't
<Vivix> it would be like to the moon
<Vivix> To the moon was GREAT, made me cry
<Vivix> but it should have ended way earlier
<MadSurge> Also Vordox, did you see my image? :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> and again you can evil as hell or be a fucking saint you still get the same endings regardless of moral choice
<Vordox> MadSurge: Indeed. that's what I said... All closures are made on YOUR side, or the game side? =/
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: Yep
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: I can unerstand the rage. >.>
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Why give players that choice if it doesnt matter in the end
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: But... did you do ALL of that in the game for a change, or did you do it cause you wanted to?
<Vivix> but on your deathbed, can't you change everything you stand for?
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: For completinist, they must have been FRICKING PISSED.
<Vivix> and your cohices earlier in the game, don't they matter in what expereince you have while playing?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wanted to do the right choices, I have this issue where I cant stand being a jerk
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: Know the feel. ._.
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: I'm a saint person myself.
<Vivix> Mostly same here, though I do ocatoinally play as a raider in fallout
<Vordox> BASTARD *Raises Pitchfork*
<Vivix> !
<Vivix> I rp! I rp!
<Vordox> However, I see a graphical end, sure it's not much...
<Vordox> But I see beyond it, I can get my own closure.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im always confused in cases when theres a difference between morally right and what you think is right
<Vivix> games should never show you waht is right and wrong
<Vordox> All philosophicla, if the game can't give me it, I'll create it myself. :P But you paid for an ending, you damn well want to get one
<Chrysalis> why is winter so damn warm
<Vordox> SpadeMagnes[School]: You mean those game that "FREEDOM" but they still give you moral choices. XD
<Vivix> Everyone, read the van buren design documents on fallout wikia
<Vivix> I think it's a masterpiece of "All these choices are wrong"
<Vivix> Damned if you do, damned if you don't
<Lil_B> Chrysalis yeah, the last 2 weeks have been way to warm here
<Chrysalis> huh, ld42 free weekend
<Vordox> Vivix: Like moral choice? You mean like Walking Dead? XD
<Chrysalis> curse my going home for the weekend
<Vivix> Walking Dead is very good at it too
<Vivix> but in Van Buren they are veeery long term
<MadSurge> Vordox: I heard that game has good choices
<Vivix> like helping a dying gang of ghouls, is basically killing people
<Vivix> not helping them is killing their innocent ones
<Vordox> So yeah Vivix ... Lackluster ending, but all implied endings has huge changes.
<Vivix> ignoring it is furthering the issue-
<pony_247028> http://epicfreeprizes.com/?ref=1421632
<Vordox> But... people are too used to getting stuff, and never think. Which is a sad evolution of game. :(
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fallout is fucking vauge on which choices are right
<Vivix> It iis
<Vivix> yeah, and I love that
<Vivix> when I play a game to plaay it, I want to experience a story
<Vordox> Nier had such a masterful closure...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I had a fucking hard time decided if the Ncr or Mr house was right or wrong
<Lil_B> The choices in the Walking Dead don't really lead to anything diofferent in the end, but they make slifght differences withing the episode
<Vordox> And we NEVER know what happened to the other 2...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *deciding
<Vordox> ;_;
<Vordox> Lil_B: Until the ending..
<Vivix> Yeah, Obsidian did a really good job in FNV, even if the start is shaky
<Chrysalis> Vivix really?
<Lil_B> Vordox is ep 5 out yet? or did it only have 4?
<Chrysalis> i thought it was pretty poor
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I can clearly tell the legion is evil
<MadSurge> Vordox: Shush, you hussie!
<Vordox> Lil_B: 4 so far.
<Vordox> MadSurge: Sorry but it's TURE
<Vordox> True*
<Vivix> Sometimes in CYOA games you have fake choices, fake choices feel like real choices, and as such you get experience of choosing
<MadSurge> :D
<Vordox> MadSurge: The fourth ending was the best closure. :P
<Vordox> MadSurge: BUT it never said anything.
<Vivix> Chrysalis, depends, I guess, I thought the major arch was better than F3, but that F3 was better as a Complete story
<Vordox> MadSurge: <3 NIER BEST GAME 2010!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> But god damn it is amusing throwing the NCR general off the damn
<SpadeMagnes[School]> *dam
<Chrysalis> f3 also played much better
<Alchemist> This is a really interesting watch if you have the time. I also encourage checking out the rest of the channel's videos. www.youtube.com/watch?v=328wX2x_s5g
<Chrysalis> storys not worth a damn when it feels so detatched
<MadSurge> Vordox: everything left up in the air~ Cavia is best trolls
<Vivix> I think the mechanics were better in FNV, actually
<Claudey> mornin
<Vordox> MadSurge: Well, not ALL of it.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> MadSurge: Trolled by Cavia
<Vordox> MadSurge: You still had to go through that bit...you know THAT bit.
<MadSurge> SpadeMagnes[School]: YEP :D
<Vivix> That's what I mean about the shaky start in FNV, you get no motivation to actually do shit
<Vivix> whilst in F3--you do
<Vordox> MadSurge: And when it happened you were crying...BIG ficking crying..
<Chrysalis> Vivix felt too cod like
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I fucking love Dark Id's lp of Drakengard
<Vivix> I dunno abou that one, the only real changes were to iron sights
<MadSurge> Vordox: there are MANY that moment. Which one? :D
<Vordox> MadSurge: The text
<Vivix> and F lore things, removing of visible skillchecks in text
<Vivix> it's just--better mechanically
<SpadeMagnes[School]> God help you if you go through the game with low intelegence
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Things get silly
<MadSurge> Vordox: aaaah, the tree one or the hussie one?
<Vordox> MadSurge: No, the D Ending.
<Vordox> When the text was being taken, remember?
<MadSurge> Vordox: Hello, InsertNameHere!
<Vordox> MadSurge: XDYes THA tpart
<alexxm> so still no stream
<Vordox> Vivix: Well, if anything...
<Vordox> Vivix: Watch a good LP of Nier. If you can find one.
<Vivix> I will, if I find one
<Vordox> Vivix: You will miss out the experience of a life time....
<Vordox> Which is sad. :(
<Vivix> Hehe, that's the curse of no consoles once in a while
<Vivix> I read more than I play, honestly,
<Vivix> but I do love games, and what goes into making them-
<MadSurge> Vivix: look for TheDarkID's LP. It's a screenshot LP, but it's great nonetheless :D
<Vivix> screenshot and voice, or?
<Vivix> I'll just google it
<MadSurge> Vivix: and if you can, look at his Drakengard LP too :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also it bothers me in games where the hero saves the world and he gets no respect
<artist> yes it does
<artist> oh, and hi!
<thelonepony> Hi artist :)
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its a major thing for me in the Megaman BattleNetwork series

<Michael> nope Dken2021 :(
<Dark_Horst> "connection failed: application rejected connection"
<Lil_B> So, did anyone else "participate" in the Portal 2 ARG in 2011?
<MahBoi777> buffer show
<Dken2021> welp, this is gonna be the longest 17 days ever then
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: saywut?
<SpeccyRush> oh Nittany_Discord hi, Sonny was lookin' for ya
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst do you know what an ARG is?
<Dark_Horst> dont think so
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Pain?
<MahBoi777> so much pain
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst it stands for Action Reallife Game. It's a Game, or challange that isn't really a Game you can buy
<Michael> talking about portal: http://derpy.me/4a
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It worries me when I hear the insides of my ds games moving
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Garrys Mod / Source Pinkie Pie Playset
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thought it stood for Alternate Reality Game?
<Dark_Horst> still confused
<Lil_B> Nittany_Discord can be as well, I just always read Actiaon Reallife Game :/
<SpeccyRush> MahBoi777: why u in pain
<Panda> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7662/
<Panda> whats going on in here?
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst in the Portal 2 ARG the "Potato Sack" came out on Steam, these were 13 Indie games which all got strange Patches
<Dken2021> stuff
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst the players had to figure out Passwordsa, combins STuff, search through the folders of the Game Files, and even finding Starnge Files on the Developers Websites
<artist> Panda: only the gods know....
<Dken2021> in other news, vanilla candles are the best candles ever
<Dark_Horst> thats new
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst one Riddle was hanging on a Potato Sack infront of a Developers Headquaters
<MahBoi777> SpeccyRush: I have no idea lol
<Dark_Horst> lol
<MahBoi777> hey Panda! ^_^
<artist> Panda: whats your DA?
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst than you could via some cryptic actions get to Aperture Sience LKogin Screens and had to enter codes, which would give you a potato (//I found mny first one by accident and then read further into it)
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/f93c869bec4d4cc52d6539068ec29b2d.jpg Pinkie wanted some rock candy :D
<Dken2021> wha?
<MahBoi777> LOL nice
<Dark_Horst> because who doesnt want pottoes
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst at the end, you could get 35 potatos, the cumulitive count of all potatoes would "Help Reboot Glados faster" release Portal 2 faster"
<Lil_B> because Potato Power :P
<Michael> MadSurge: wow that's good
<Dark_Horst> aha
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And they would only add minutes to the release timer.
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning everyone :)
<Dken2021> evening AdamTheDuck

<Lyra`> i liek weird names~
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: yup
<Rev> Damn it, I was hoping I could sire Lyra`'s children.
<CriticKitten> You forgot to name one of them "Alex", Saturn.
<CriticKitten> Then you'd have the whole set, Alex Louis Armstrong.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: and that is why you are my new favorite planet.
<Saturn> 08,01if i have a girl, i shall name her "Liberty"
<RAWRity> hey guys
<Saturn> 08,01then her full name will be "Liberty Bell"
<Lyra`> her middle name needs to be prime

<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: or Rosy
<Saturn> 08,01but then it becomes slightly dirty
<lordzircon> hey someone is useing my name
<thelonepony> or your ghosting
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: THat's not bad.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I have an affinity towards Saturn's largest moon titan,
<Dken2021> neat RAWRity
<Lyra`> but Saturn, you never answered
<DoctoDoctorWho> oops, accidental ping
<RAWRity> from the front: http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/269868_448420925210199_2097282425_n.jpg
<Lyra`> do you like john lee hooker?
<lordzircon> DoctoDoctorWho: someone is using my name
<Lyra`> also, boys, a quick lesson, playing a girls favorite jazz song is the best way to get a date with her
<GilDash> You know, I've never head of any jazz muscians, or song names, and I've no desire to. There's something I enjoy about just being able to switch onto it and listen regardless.
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: That's kind of completely awesome
<sonicdude558> oh man plushies
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: not heard much of him, but what i've heard i've liked
<GilDash> It's good for NaNoWriMo too. Helps me concentrate.
<Lyra`> have you heard Boom Boom?
<Dken2021> lordzircon did you register your name? if not, then just wait awile before the name disappears
<Lyra`> or house rent boogie?
<Saturn> 08,01blues isn't the main styule of music i'm into
<oGriofa> Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?
<ASoftFluffyThing> So....
<Saturn> 08,01i'm mostly an old classical toff
<DoctoDoctorWho> Lyra`: that, or slowly circle her and growl. But that only works at star trek con's tho...:)
<Lyra`> ahah
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: to be honest, i'm rubbish with names
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeeaaaaaaaaad.
<NocturnalBlade|HW> well i'm back quicker than expected :D
<Lyra`> you'd know Boom Boom if you heard it
<sonicdude558> http://i.imgur.com/JuUXf.jpg I am getting one soon
<thelonepony> wb NocturnalBlade|HW :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeead
<x1es> Saturn: Speaking of jazz.. Do you dig Max Roach?
<Lyra`> try to find the version they played in Blues Brothers
<AJIsAwesome> sonicdude558: Nice! :)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> huh so apparently ACR is either glitchy as hell or the multiplayer servers are messed :S which explains my ps3 crashing though it works good w/ uncharted,etc. i hope AC 3 doesnt have these problems :(
<therainbowvortex> Dken2021: oh ty that worked
<thelonepony> Sketch_Toku_Brony: just wait for an Hour or two
<Lyra`> anyone know the band GoodLuck?
<oGriofa> Emry is going to work on my piniiepie plushie soon :3
<ASoftFluffyThing> And you killed it
<Lyra`> theyre a south african band, like, around cape town, and theyre AWESOME!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> thelonepony: did it happen to you too?
<RAWRity> the best way I'VE found to get a date is to be a girl's friend for years until she asks you out. Granted that's not very feasible in the short term but hey.
<Saturn> 08,01x1es: i do dig me a bit of that
<thelonepony> i Don't have A PS3 :$
<sonicdude558> I will not have to stick with my imaginary one for long :P
<Lyra`> RAWRity, unless shes desperate, she wont ask out a friend shes had for that long
<thelonepony> But sometimes you have to wait for a bit
<Dken2021> therainbowvortex you can register your nick with the nickserv, gonna need an email address though
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> thelonepony: oh :D well the multiplayer in ACR has been like this lately and its not my ps3 since it plays Uncharted no prob
<therainbowvortex> Dken2021: i have one how do i do it
<Lyra`> hate to tell you this
<sonicdude558> u should get one thelonepony http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KDHViSGD8s
<x1es> Saturn: The album, "jazz in 3/4 time", is most excellent, imo. But I'm a sucker for 3/4 time, so opinions may be biased.
<Lyra`> i suppose so, x1es
<Dken2021> therainbowvortex it was /msg nickserv register, and then something else, forgot
<Saturn> 08,01i used to write jazzy pieces
<thelonepony> sonicdude558: no video links during stream :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Sabaton, Two steps from hell, ACDC, Blind Gaurdian, Black Sabbath. If these arent on your favorite list, your on mine.
<sonicdude558> Intermission :P
<Lyra`> its hard to play jazz on the harp, or the lyre >.<
<thelonepony> You could of Pm the Link to me :3
*DoctoDoctorWho loads m200 intervention
<sonicdude558> So technically there is no stream
<CrimsonPhoenix> sonicdude558, Aw man it's mah man Chadwarden
<Saturn> 08,01one was a sonata-form piece for viola, organ, cello, and tubular bell
<Panda> I had no idea it was even possible to play jazz on the lyre >.>
<sonicdude558> I thought about this, and I think this will never happen,
<Lyra`> its hard
<Saturn> 08,01the viola was going in 4/4 time, the organ in 5/4 time, and the cello in 7/8
<Saturn> 08,01it was kinda weird
<sonicdude558> but chadwarden should make another video
<Lyra`> very hard panda
<sonicdude558> and compare the PS4 to the Wii u and Xbox 720
<Lyra`> also, PM time, panda
<Panda> O_O
<Dken2021> sonicdude558 you don't hear from him these days
<Panda> why the hell did I speak /)_(\
<sonicdude558> right
<sonicdude558> Dken2021
<CrimsonPhoenix> sonicdude558, Chadwarden has most likely moved on
<Lyra`> this is my favorite part of the song~
<CrimsonPhoenix> but yeah that video was quite a phenom back in the day
<Lyra`> that solo <3
<Dken2021> PS triple is best triple
<Saturn> 08,01oh hell an dbuggery
<Saturn> 08,01i remember chadwarden
<Saturn> 08,01THE XBOX TRIPLE
<Saturn> 08,01wait, no
<sonicdude558> er PS
<Saturn> 08,01something like that
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, it's PS Triple
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: quick question, if you wouldnt mind...
<Reikim> Sooooo
*Saturn 08,01does not know about videogames
<Reikim> Is anything interesting happening in here?
<Dken2021> sweet, lova ya Saturn
<thelonepony> sonicdude558: probably. does it let you play old PS games?
*ASoftFluffyThing squeezes everything
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: sure
<AJIsAwesome> It's alright Saturn. :D
<Reikim> Oh look, people.
<Reikim> Typing things.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Nope
<Yahooz> shit
<GilDash> Panda: What's wrong with speaking? It's only when you mention it that you draw attention to yourself. ^_^
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chadwarden knew what trolling really was
<Reikim> And, as a matter of fact, they are hitting enter as well.
<Yahooz> no i aint
<Saturn> 08,01who the hell was it that requested this?
<Yahooz> this be a mac
<ASoftFluffyThing> Just a weirdo pony that looks like a pillow and acts like one
<Yahooz> RETUUUUUURN MOTHAFUCKAS
<GilDash> Say boring crap like me all the time and you'll never be referenced. XD
<Saturn> 08,01Afrika Bambaataa
<Panda> GilDash >.> only if you knew
<ASoftFluffyThing> ENTER!
<Reikim> The end result appears to be white text appearing on my black IRC client.
<Dken2021> Saturn probably me, asked if you had anything
<RDash5000> sup guys?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I've worked on a Mac before in class
<AJIsAwesome> HI, RDash5000. :)
<thelonepony> Hi RDash5000 :)
<Dken2021> allo RDash5000
<therainbowvortex> RDash5000: hi
<GilDash> Panda: Eh, it's debateable as to what I really know. XD
<sonicdude558> Random Fact: Did you know that the PS1 Model Number Scph-1001 is valueable because of its high quality DAC chip? It also has AV Jacks soldered to the board for non distorted audio. The Scph-1001 is as valueable as a $5000 Dedicated Disc Player.
<Reikim> I am so astounded by these results that my monacle has plain popped off.
*ASoftFluffyThing puts Reikim's monocole back on his eye.
<Coldays> im back, Ohi RDash5000
<Panda> GilDash, this cannot be debated. I am sure you don't know >.> at least I sure as hell hope not XD
<GilDash> Panda: Oh! Whilst I remember and aren't actually busy, did you mean to tell me something on Monday? :S

<Dken2021> dang backwards compatible
<CrimsonPhoenix> thelonepony, gee I don't know
<GilDash> This is quite a long intermission...
<Saturn> 08,01Coldays: i was going to play some Journeyman, but people wanted to listen to music
<thelonepony> WHY DIDN'T I BUY THE PS3?!

*sonicdude558 dodges the train like a baws
<Pinkies4thWall> DerpyMuffins: That would be the ceiling
<DerpyMuffins> Or floor
<Kandarihu> DerpyMuffins, if there's a 5th wall, it's one that prevents the real world from affecting the world of fiction... or at least the viewers.
<x1es> Pinkie pie went idnoclip and boke the fourth wall.
<Pinkies4thWall> Dken2021: IMPOSSIBLE
<Coldays> NOOOOOOOOOO
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: someone requested Flo Rida

<DerpyMuffins> I only know the name of their band
<sonicdude558> I checked, Flo Rida is born in Florida! How ironic
<DerpyMuffins> Thats about it
<twilight_sprinkle> but i dont really know that much about them either, i know most of their songs though
<Dken2021> I only have two albums of the beatles
<Metronome> Wht's this song?
<Yahooz> Flo Rida over the beatles? those are some wack priorities
<DerpyMuffins> Saturn was taking request before
<sonicdude558> I can easily say this is bad music
*Pinkies4thWall bewares
<ASoftFluffyThing> I had an English 2 teacher who loved The Beatles
<DerpyMuffins> Someone wanted Flo
<Lyra`> the cure.
<Coldays> i like it

<Saturn> 08,01x1es: you play cello?
<Saturn> 08,01i play cello!

<DerpyMuffins> Then my parents made me switch to piaano
<DerpyMuffins> piano
<x1es> Saturn: I wouldn't go that far to say I play. But I'm trying to learn. It's a slow process, but I'm making progress. ^^
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: Octy friend?
<Lyra`> is this even music?
<sonicdude558> Have a bad game. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8CYhfsbX48

<DerpyMuffins> Dat vid link
<Dken2021> I need to self-learn piano one day
<Saturn> 08,01x1es: if you want lessons over skype, i'm happy to give you some :D
<DerpyMuffins> I know how to play piano, but I hate it
<Lyra`> its flat, bland, and the vocalist sounds more like a country singer, than a rock artist
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oi sonicdude558. There's a stream.
<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: indeed
<Lyra`> the string instrument sounds flat
<sonicdude558> Not really ASoftFluffyThing
<Lyra`> and the drums fade into the background
<twilight_sprinkle> "its the fool who plays it cool, and making his world a little colder" is a great line in hey jude, something many people should think about
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: it's most likely the way it's recorded/mastered
<Pinkies4thWall> Saturn: don't give me ideas, i have skype on a hairtrigger
<x1es> Saturn: oooh. I may take you up on that one day.
<Saturn> 08,01the EQ is way off
<Pinkies4thWall> and you
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: Do you watch Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood? Please say you do
<Pinkies4thWall> I have your contact

<sonicdude558> oh

<Lyra`> anyone heard of Goodluck?

<Saturn> 08,01DoctoDoctorWho: for me, it had much more emotional impact
<Lyra`> also, saturn, can i post a youtube?
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: if it's clean, sure
<Pinkies4thWall> Saturn: what say you to a quick skype?
