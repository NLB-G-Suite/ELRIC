<Kammerjunk> Unnr: Yeah, but the problem is that I can only have one T-shirt on at a time if I want it all to be visible. So instead, I need MLP shoes or pants or maybe even a hat.
<AttackPony> I just bought my very first pony shirt for 7.99
<GilDash> Om: Maybe you've got to use Google this time. :p
<CriticKitten> Bronysith: I've yet to see a game I feel is worth monthly payments, to be honest. 'swhy I bought GW2. One time payment for a solid quality MMO? Sure thing.

<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: i mean a handrawn or computer drawn one. not the pony creator
<FlareChaser> I dunno
<Unnr> alexxm, because the world is not ready for it.
<Kammerjunk> FlareChaser: Trust me, you do NOT want to see me draw anything.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would find a use for an OC if I get famous somehow
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Bronysith not done mine
<FlareChaser> Kammerjunk: as in for you...
<CrimsonPhoenix> but now I am in no need
<Kammerjunk> FlareChaser: I've done nothing worthy of the sort.

<CrimsonPhoenix> and also I don't really enjoy sephiroth, not that I hate him but he's just uninteresting
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: There is no way that's coincidence.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Vordox it's lyra and bon bon ALWAYS
<cachi01> fun fact: Lyra's best friend is carrot top not bon bon
<Canadian_Brony> trilogy
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: B?
<Bronysith> cachi01: but her lover is bonbon
<Kammerjunk> Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - A or B film?
<CountDoofus> Canadian_Brony: do you think Canadians would be butthurt seeing a Fluttershy dressed in a mountie uniform saying "Yay, eh?"
<Vordox> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Yeah but they cannot USE Bon Bon's name
<MASF123> Golden Harvest doesn't sound as good as Carrot Top
<cachi01> ikr
<Vordox> MASF123: She has both names
<Meanwhile> Yeah that's what I was afraid of. Because The Matrix is queued in the trilogies event I need a new A movie to pick and I can't think of any. >_<
<Canadian_Brony> CoundDoofus -_(\ . . .
<Vordox> Just like Derpy

<Alchemist> yay, got my newsletter
<AttackPony> I chose Chicken Run for A
<AttackPony> aaand chat derp
<Alchemist> Man on fire for me. Its been a while I saw it.
<MASF123> If I could make a suggestion for a movie right now, can it be "The Warriors?"
<Meanwhile> What do we think is the average rating for an A movie without much budget? 6.5? 7?
<Canadian_Brony> CountDoofus if she were to properly use "Eh?", whe wouldn't use it after a vowel sound, esecially a hard A. It would sound like "Yay-ay?"
<Canadian_Brony> afk
<Alchemist> Meanwhile: I think it can go till 7.5
<cachi01> WE WILL WATCH EL DORADO? WOOOHOO
<MASF123> Or The Warriors? :)
<Kammerjunk> Hmm... Dr. Strangelove - A or B film?
<cachi01> 2 girls 1 cup hmmm a or b?
<Bronysith> I got... 300 for A, Labyrinth for B
<Bronysith> cachi01: um. x
<Kammerjunk> I mean, I suppose it's a "cult classic", but I'm not even completely certain what that means.
<Bronysith> cachi01: X movie lol
<cachi01> lol
<StinkomanFan> The first MLP film, A or B?
<Kammerjunk> StinkomanFan: Clear B.

<Quick_Thinker> i fell asleep XD
<Majestic_Sparkler> SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET LOL when!?
<StinkomanFan> I HAVE AN IDEA
<Elondras> hey everypony
<alexxm> cachi01 i heard they were conserding it for the next season
<Kammerjunk> StinkomanFan: I mean, it has a critic rating of 5.5, and it's not a Hollywood production.
<StinkomanFan> WHAT IF WE STREAM MARBLE HORNETS
<alexxm> hey Elondras hows your day been
<Kammerjunk> alexxm: That'd be pretty neat.
<Kammerjunk> But seriously, though, is Dr. Strangelove an A film?
<Quick_Thinker> and what is marble hornets ?
<Kammerjunk> Quick_Thinker: Slenderman?
<alexxm> StinkomanFan vote it for movie night
<cachi01> alexxm: awesome now i have a reason to watch it
<FlareChaser> Chicken.
<Elondras> hey alexxm pretty good how was your's?
<StinkomanFan> I can only imagine the fear that'd flow from the orifices of our society
<Meanwhile> Quick_Thinker: A Slenderman based series on youtube.
<cachi01> stream?
<Kammerjunk> Marble Hornets isn't that scary.
<alexxm> Quick_Thinker you ever heard of the slenderman
<StinkomanFan> THE NIGHTMARES THAT WOULD BREAK THROUGH OUR PSCYCHE
<Quick_Thinker> slender man eh well im not looking forward to that
<Majestic_Sparkler> I look forward to the nightmares... Is that wierd?
<FlareChaser> Slenderman? fake.
<StinkomanFan> It's much scarier if you live near some woods
<alexxm> cachi01 if they do do the slenderman episode on supernatural do you think he should be some multi episode type monster
<cachi01> yep
<AttackPony> Balloon Party After Party is out, guys!

<Meanwhile> Ponies47: There are things in the shadows.
<RAWRity> Stupid mangaka getting pregnant.
<Majestic_Sparkler> Ponies47: Jelly .(

<FlareChaser> well crap.
<pony_5114> I think it's safe to say that everyone here is a brony
<AJThMightyGamer> yep
<alexxm> cachi01 perhaps have some other hunter they run into one episode talk about some old case he worked on where children were going missing and he couldn't find anything on it apart from people saying they only saw a man in a suit
<Ponies47> Yep. Home alnoe, no other poneis, dad and brother are at a baseball game so I'm happy :)
<Ponies47> *alone

<Dalekkahn> Any chance we could have some 10th doctor streamed?
<RAWRity> http://chzpokememes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/12ohyarjmeqvfwwo3otggq2.jpg
<flutter_spin> huh. So Zero Punctuation chose to review that game?
<Lil_B> It tells Non-Bronys where the fandom comes from, and it shows Bronys that Lauren wasn't the only Person who made it great 8and it shows that G1 and 2 aren't that bad)
<cachi01> i wonder what happens if andrew wk and pinkie pie host a party
<StinkomanFan> prince-dari! Stream Zero Punctuation!
<anon3mous324> dont ask or complain he will stop the vids and bann u
<prince-dari> For all the awesome people out there

<Lil_B> I might now the names of all 151 (and Missingno XD) but I can't put them into order :/
<flutter_spin> The problem is I only had 1 mobile device... it was the game boy color
<Jim> I have my old gameboy here around somewhere, but I'm not really using it
<flutter_spin> After that, I lost out. I got tired of seeing a new mobile unit every year or so
<anon3mous324> pokemon was only cool in the third grade
<Jim> Not planning to sell it either
<StinkomanFan> POKEY MAN
<StinkomanFan> WITH THE POKEY AND THE MAN
<Biglaw> I think I can remember all the pokemon up to the end of the Jhoto dex
<StinkomanFan> AND THE GUY COMES OUT OF THE THING
<flutter_spin> How does Ash get Pikachu on the bus?
<flutter_spin> Pokemon

<devildog> happy 4th of july
<RyunosukeKnT> Comedy Puzzle + Portal creators + Q! = TAKE MY FUCKING MONEY! :p
<alexxm> cachi01 i was thinking perhaps slenderman would be one of the things they can't find a weakness for so they scare it off per say and the episode ends with a shot from the back of a man in a suit watch them driving away in the imparala and then tentacles out the guys back
<Majestic_Sparkler> Ponies47: Wish it was me :( each time im alone i sing mlp songs out loud.
<anon3mous324> hay prince dari timstr is my neighbor is standing beside me. he told me to tell u ur a :[ cuz u banned him

<hen3ry> Dusky|Asleep|hpy4th: Actually I think I have brain damage now.

*Dusky|Asleep|hpy4th shrugs at hen3ry
<StinkomanFan> Am I the only one who thinks the Bronycon Fire was an Arson attempt?
<AJThMightyGamer> Randomnerd: oh boy
<devildog> bye Saturn
<Lil_B> Vordox ok :) the second is if you want to see the WIP of your OC drawn by me (I was rather bored today and I stumbled upon your OC)
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: Yes.
<Randomnerd> Ponies47: AJThMightyGamer You should talk to Saturn in the future about starting a convention. He's started one in the UK.
<cachi01> anypony knows if My Little Portal already released?
<Shamroc> harumph
<prince-dari> By the way, can you ask timstr how our little arrangement is coming together anon3mous324?
<Vordox> Oh awe...wait..how did you get ahold of my OC?
<AJThMightyGamer> ok i will keep that in mind
<Randomnerd> I'm lucky, I live in NY, so I have Bronies NYC to handle all that.
<FlareChaser> Lol..
<Lil_B> Vordox you showed it to me once
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> prince-dari do you think he will realise soon that you can see his Host ?
<anon3mous324> yes he is pissed
<prince-dari> Nope
<Ponies47> Randomnerd: Yes he did. That might not be such a bad idea. Yeah but like there gonna listen to a 14 year old like me -_-
<Shamroc> wut?
<prince-dari> He thinks being kicked from IRC means he's banned
<AJThMightyGamer> or a 15 year old like me...
<prince-dari> I don't think he'll ever understand hosts
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> prince-dari True, Have fun ~
<flutter_spin> whoa whoa whoa whoa ... John Delance did Quantum Conundrum?
<StinkomanFan> 16 Year old like me
<Vordox> Lil_B: Weird that you saved it XD But thanks!
<flutter_spin> Now I HAVE to get the game!
<Randomnerd> Would you be able to start a "Meetup" on meetup.com?
<Vordox> I can't wait for you to try and draw him. :)
<Lil_B> Vordox me never forgets something (exept names, dates, procedure, phone nmbers and all things that are actually important in life...)
<devildog> 14 year old like me
<prince-dari> No, I mean when we were going to meet up
<Vordox> Know the feel Bro. /)
<prince-dari> I arranged it with him earlier
<Shamroc> again....wut?

<MadSurge> flutter_spin: he voiced the Glados-like scientist :$
<Lil_B> Vordox (\
<StinkomanFan> THAT EXPLAINS ALL OF YAHTZEE'S COMPLAINTS
<Meanwhile> Just smile and wave.
<Shamroc> but i dont want to
<Ponies47> I'm wondering if I could take the train out to Ohio or somthing and get a hotel stay for the whole weekend and go to all 3 days of Canterlot Gardens
<Randomnerd> All things considered, that might be the best place to start... check on meet-up if there's a brony group in your area already.
<anon3mous324> he said that when he thought he was banned he went nuts and his mom said no more computer today
<MadSurge> StinkomanFan: what did he say this time? -__-
<Vordox> o.o
<Meanwhile> StinkomanFan: Or the fact that his complaints are legit.
<Vordox> anon3mous324: Someone needs a dose of patience
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shamroc timstr is anon3 yadda yadda new foal does not know nothing about irc
<cachi01> LOLOLOLOOLOL http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/06/29/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-regular-trollestia/

<Randomnerd> I keep forgetting you don't live in Queens, StinkomanFan -__-
<flutter_spin> Celestia just looks so epic there cachi01
<APS> Morning all
<Randomnerd> Hey, APS
<Lil_B> Vordox the problem is that i still suck at Hair (not to mention the closeth) and its not like my previous projects, this time its more Desktop Pony-like
<Meanwhile> Newfoals can't soonforce.
<devildog> hi APS
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i want to draw... i can't feel my arms cause i went to the gym.. /Firstworldproblems
<Shamroc> ...yep
<cachi01> APS: Y U N O
<MadSurge> StinkomanFan: yeah, physics are wonky in a game with time freezing, who would have thought
<StinkomanFan> Although, Quantom Physics do state that once something is watched it will change the outcome...
<prince-dari> You get your internet from comcast anon3mous324?
<Vordox> Lil_B: Desktop Pony like?!
<cachi01> http://bronies.memebase.com/2012/06/29/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-im-having-a-dawww-attack/ no really click the link if u want daws now click it or else u will die

<prince-dari> Just had a feeling that you do
<Lil_B> Vordox I'll just upload the version i have so far and let you judge :)
<AttackPony> evening, APS
<Vordox> ok
<AJThMightyGamer> brb guys, gonna go shower
<StinkomanFan> Therefore... If Yahtzee had played that game without WATCHING it, than it's have a different outcome!
<alexxm> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhRnWMBcNQQ&feature=related i demand a horror movie about this guy
<AttackPony> 92% complete
<Unnr> Mmm, dinner is almost ready (and at a sane hour for the first time in aeons). Pulled pork for the meat eaters and cilantro-lime marinated portabella mushroom caps for the veggies. <3
<StinkomanFan> QUICK, WE NEED TO STREAM THIS
<Ponies47> Ohai APS :p
<AttackPony> Unnr: That sounds delicious
<prince-dari> So do you and timstr share internet then anon3mous324?
<Meanwhile> dari: You should stream more Heroes instead of poking Newfoals. :P
<anon3mous324> no
<Vordox> You show me your work I'll show you mine. =3 Still also WIP
<prince-dari> Mebbe Meanwhile
<StinkomanFan> prince-dari plz
<MadSurge> prince-dari: more Man vs Wild :D
*AttackPony BRUSHIE's Meanwhile's moustache and runs away quickly in fear
<StinkomanFan> >Stream's down
<StinkomanFan> >Drink Piss
<anon3mous324> dont ask he will bann
*Meanwhile twiddles his moustache.
<FlareChaser> ...
<Shamroc> .....i need a beard
<prince-dari> You sure anon3mous324? Looks to me like you both use the same internet, even coming from the same address and house
*AttackPony hides behind a rock and waits
<FlareChaser> I want a beard..
<FlareChaser> then I can be a wizard..
<Vordox> Oh mai, that's weird prince-dari .
<RyunosukeKnT> know what I hate?
<anon3mous324> well than ur internet sucks cuz he is my neighbor
<FlareChaser> People.
<Vordox> anon3mous324: That's not exactly nice wordings there.
<StinkomanFan> You must sap Wi-fi from him than
<Shamroc> oh god this is funny
<StinkomanFan> Or vice-versa
<RyunosukeKnT> the fact that you guys have been showing clips for today... and all of a sudden I go to the bank needing money
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wut ?
<anon3mous324> well his house is right next to mine so, it may be
<Shamroc> dari trollin the newfoal..
<prince-dari> anon3mous324, hmm this is odd, you have exactly the same IP address as timstr though, which tends to mean you're using the same internet connection
<Vordox> Can you check port?
<Vordox> Also, same IP means same computer?
<AttackPony> prince-dari: Maybe anon3mous is timstr, just going by a different name
<anon3mous324> his internet sucks so sometimes he will use mine with permissian tho
<Vordox> I thought all IP were unique.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Vordox most of the times yes
<Shizuka> 13same IP means same border gateway
<Shizuka> 13nothing more
<Vordox> Oh
<Vordox> well then anon3mous324 You may have been in a scam
<Vordox> Internet scamming is normal
<alexxm> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhRnWMBcNQQ&feature=related whoever played the clown needs to be in a horror movie
<Shizuka> 13even MAC addresses aren't unique
<Shamroc> ohai Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13although MAC and IP addresses are required to be unique within the same broadcast domain
<anon3mous324> no i sometimes let him today is one time
<prince-dari> Ahh, he uses your internet
<anon3mous324> sometimes
<StinkomanFan> Be glad your pal wasn't IP banned
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that's always fun
<Unnr> To be fair, when IPv6 is fully rolled out, the spec calls for linking addresses to MAC addresses, so things are going to be resolved a little more finely...
<Deceptive_Cadence> ^
<anon3mous324> true
<cachi01> what happened to anon3mous324???????????
<prince-dari> Hmm
<FlareChaser> All dem ???'s
<Jim> I call shenanigans
<anon3mous324> y u want me to tell him something
<cachi01> FlareChaser: like these?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
<Deceptive_Cadence> anon3mous324, have you ever been diagnosed with Multiple Personality Syndrome before?
<prince-dari> You want to watch out anon3mous324, my servers are picking up some dodgy downloads that timstr seems to have been using your internet for http://i.imgur.com/lyAKY.gif
<Kandarihu> What's the deal with IPv6 anyway. Is it supposed to be fully rolled out or what?
<FlareChaser> Now my good sir, all these ?'s have been too much.
<prince-dari> You could get in some serious trouble for that
<anon3mous324> no
<Vordox> WHOA
<cachi01> FUCK
<Vordox> I see a pirate!
<cachi01> DAT PIRATE
<Unnr> prince-dari: those plushies are a bit to g3 for my tastes

<Meanwhile> You wouldn't download a kebab
<FlareChaser> Shamroc: wasn't there a commerical that was all like: You wouldn't download a car"
<Kipkat07_USAF> haaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy
<Yahooz> Car piracy?
<Kandarihu> But copying is not theft. He's only copying the car, not stealing it.
<Yahooz> dant
<Shamroc> FlareChaser: thats the joke..
<Yahooz> *dang

<EggWhite> Hey Jim how are you?

<StinkomanFan> YOU WOULDN'T KILL A POLICEMAN
<Meanwhile> anon3mous324: Then he's a twat.
<Yahooz> >doesnt spell startek right
<StinkomanFan> AND THEN TAKE A DUMP IN HIS HAT
<Yahooz> *startrek
<Shamroc> Meanwhile: indeed...

<Deceptive_Cadence> Yahooz: Neither did you : P
<Meanwhile> Yahooz: Ironnnyyyyy
<Jim> anon3mous324: Yeah, clearly you can see he's canceled those downloads
<Kammerjunk> StinkomanFan: And then, send it to the policeman's greaving widow!
<StinkomanFan> THEN MAIL IT TO HIS GRIEVING WIDOW
<alexxm> who wants to see something creepy
<StinkomanFan> THEN STEAL IT BACK
<devildog> me
<Kammerjunk> grieving* Spelling is silly.
*FlareChaser is ignoring whats happening in the background
<AttackPony> StinkomanFan: I remember what show that came from but forgot the name. Isn't it some British improv called IT something?
<alexxm> devildog http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhRnWMBcNQQ&feature=related

<AttackPony> Unnr: I love that show.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> prince-dari i thoug everyone must be over 12 to use this network or they are braking da rulz
<StinkomanFan> IDK, I saw it in a GMod video
<Kammerjunk> I would totally download burgers illegally if I could.

<hen3ry> no burger like a copyburger
<Barbetos> I have to admit, I am glad to see a newsletter this week. ^^
<anon3mous324> well he is an idiot,
*AttackPony hasn't watched The IT Crowd in a while....
<Jim> Kammerjunk: Now I want BURGERS!
<Meanwhile> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: YOU BROKE THE RULES. EVERYONE'S GONNA BE MAD.
*Jim burger rains
<StinkomanFan> Piracy, IMAGINE YOUR CAR IS STOLEN
<Kammerjunk> Jim: You're welcome.
<Liokin> anon3mous324: You shouldn't pirate bro its just not kool. It's stealing. And for that matter it just shows that you dont really support the creators of whatever it is your pirating. And if you pirate enough i'm pretty sure they can trace you.
<StinkomanFan> BUT IT'S THERE IN THE MORNING
<cachi01> wasnt timstr the douchebag of yesterday??????
<Kammerjunk> StinkomanFan: BUT IT'S TH-
*FlareChaser is mad at TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<prince-dari> So anon3mous324, if timstr thought he was banned, and he uses your internet
<Kammerjunk> oh
<FlareChaser> NYAH!
<prince-dari> Why did he go over to your house to have you come on and talk to me
<prince-dari> On the same internet he thought was banned?
<Yahooz> timstr is a 10 year old pirate who uses others internets. case closed
<FlareChaser> ^^
<Kammerjunk> I am seriously confused right now.
<hen3ry> you're having way too much fun with this, Prince.
<EggWhite> YOU BROKE THE RULES, YOU BROKE THE RULES, YOU BROKE THE RULES EVERYTHING IS RUINED.
<anon3mous324> cuz he wanted me to tell u how angry he was
<EggWhite> sorry caps lock
<Kipkat07_USAF> I r confuzzled
<FlareChaser> I didn't break the rules D:
<Shamroc> Kammerjunk: hush...everthing will be made clear in a few moments
<Yahooz> anon3mous324: why is he angry?
<Kammerjunk> Shamroc: But I'm so confussled! D:
<anon3mous324> he thought he was banned
<alexxm> devildog what did you think
<Kammerjunk> confuzzled*
<prince-dari> But if he thought he was banned and uses your internet

<Unnr> Kammerjunk: just smile and nod. it will keep you sane
<Deceptive_Cadence> But anon3mous324, Spiderman.mp4.
<FlareChaser> Shamroc: I'm laughing at this whole situation.

<StinkomanFan> NO ONE'S GIVING A FLYING FEATHER
<Vordox> MASF123: All the people you met in your school are starting to spread out in their life, expanding where they wish to aim. Keeping contact is the most important piece, but you need to learn which of your friends you can support and they support you with your life.
<xMLPxREACTORx> whats your guys favorite song in the mlp community
<Chrysalis> ooh Shutterfly your a UK brony going to BUCK?
*Nelaj smiles as he zips over to her "Hey what's up Buttercup! Ohh that rymed!"

<alexxm> Saturn sorry i don't have the money to go
<Pelagius> hello everyone!
<Liokin> xMLPxREACTORx: To F{yay}K

<MASF123> After school crisis? Well...they were my childhood friends. This was before MLP of course.
<alexxm> hey Pelagius hows your day been
<kirzstryfe> 8,6xMLPxREACTORx, I suggest you take a look at our rules if you plan to stick around, which at this point seems unlikely. www.bronystate.net/rules
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> alexxm This Makai Knight named Kouga fights these monsters called Horrors in secret but while saving this girl,she get some of the Horrors blood on her which in Kouga's Tribe means he must kill those who have been coated in Horrors Blood due to the blood causin INTENSE pain and kill the person in 3 or so months,However Kouga devotes himself to saving the girl while fighting the Horrors behind the scenes of Humanity...
<xMLPxREACTORx> oo i retarted:(
<Vordox> MASF123: Then it's weeding.
<prince-dari> It means buck the same as the word normally does.
<Pelagius> alexxm: great, yours?

<StinkomanFan> That'd be impossible
<Ponies47> Shutterfly: He doesn't give to (squee)s about anything else but his video games. When he's playing you can never get him away from them. NEVER O_O
<Ponies47> *two
<Fou_Lou> MASF123: i agree with Kammerjunk have watched the whole thing too. and cant really see what you saw in it. he seems to like the show and the commentary is usual trash talk
<DocSane> You can't go back in time and change the thing that causes you to go back in time.
<flutter_spin> her name is Leia
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<xMLPxREACTORx> leia who
<BaconMane> Sorry about the sudden mass of joins/quits guys )
<DocSane> It creates a paradox.

<Buttercup_Cream> It's k)
<flutter_spin> is that good special or bad special
<Shutterfly> Ponies47: oh wow.. Don't get me wrong, I'm a gamer, but seriously, that's kinda rediculous.
<twilight_sprinkle> xMLPxREACTORx: leia neg
<MASF123> Fou_Lou I could find him there. I'm not anxious to find him, just want to know if he's still brony is all.

<FlareChaser> Kipkat07_USAF: Meh Squidward.
<Fou_Lou> MASF123: i you see him there he probably still is brony. but if he isnt it doesnt have to be bad. I have gone through like 3 or 4 subcultures since i was 16.
<Saigneur> fine thank you alexxm ^^
<GilDash> Saigneur: I like the 1st season. :)
<Ponies47> Shutterfly: Yes it is. Everytime I go into his romm to ask him somthing this is what he usually says get out or what in a very annoyed tone -_-
<flutter_spin> I avoid interviews. They don't seem to settle well with me
<Ponies47> *room
<Saigneur> too bad it end at 4th season, they need a fifth
<DocSane> First series of Heroes was great....till the last episode.
<flutter_spin> ditto DocSane

<Liokin> Ponies47: -lol what your older brother or something?
<xMLPxREACTORx> they made a 4th season
<xMLPxREACTORx> i want to see it
<Ponies47> Liokin: Yes. He's 16 I'm 14
<flutter_spin> When they started airing the advertisements for the cheerleader, I lost it
<fluttercry> 05,15Give me a 4th season of The Inbetweeners and I'll be happy
<Ponies47> And he hates ponies :(
<Buttercup_Cream> "Not a whole hell of a lot, really. You?"
<Liokin> Ponies47: -lol sheep glomp him then.
<MASF123> Fou_Lou, I just would like to remember the 1st person that greeted me the 1st time I got to Bronystate.
<RyunosukeKnT> so wait, is he evil or not?
<fluttercry> 05,15also, the movie is being released in the U.S. this year and I will drag my friends to it.

<FlareChaser> run away!
<Ponies47> Liokin: He may be older but I'm taller :P
<xMLPxREACTORx> i thought they made 2 seasons
<Shutterfly> Ponies47: the fact that he's the older one makes it even worse... From one younger sibling to another, you're awesome for gaining such respect from your parents while your older brother just sits in his room. /)
*Nelaj shrugs "I guess nothing as well. Not a lot happens here. At least whenever I come here."
<StinkomanFan> I can't afford $79 a night!

<Loquacious_Brony> Kammerjunk: thank you.

*Bronysith group hugs Shizuka with LadyCanary

<TheHoodyNinja> speaking of wich, Shizuka, why arent you making dinner?
<Meanwhile> I pride myself on being unbiased.
<cachi01> CriticKitten: lol
<Meanwhile> Wait is that the right word?
<LadyCanary> ....Is that the Onceler, Alchemist?
<cachi01> some of us respect ladies
<Shizuka> 13because you forgot to pay the gas bill
<Shizuka> 13see how it works? :3
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: I'm equally biased against everything. :3
<TheHoodyNinja> I didnt forget i just didnt remember
<Alchemist> LadyCanary, uhm, I dont know who/what Onceler is...
<RAWRity> Shizuka: but we use an electric stove...
<LadyCanary> Alchemist: Oh! From the Lorax

<Meanwhile> Yahooz: Shame, that'd be hilarious.
<ScootaChicken> I think there might be a video of me crowd surfing at the Red Hot Chili Peppers gig...
<ScootaChicken> I can't be bothered to go find it though : P
<Ponies47> TheHoodyNinja: Sorry. It was just to cute I had to. I JUST HAD TO! :$
<CountDoofus> CriticKitten: I had the same problem for hours, but it finally worked for me now. Just keep at it.
<cachi01> buck yeah RHCP ScootaChicken /)
<RAWRity> I never got the appeal of crowd surfing. "Ooh, I can make strangers grope me/steal my wallet as they precariously consider dropping me."
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ScootaChicken: But noone wants to watch jailbait, Jennifer.
<TheHoodyNinja> Ponies47: thats ok, just remember to take your cyanide pills :)

<flutter_spin> Radiarc's music tends to all be a bit fast for me
<TheHoodyNinja> Ponies47: oh thats okay then :$
<flutter_spin> There was one that I liked, only because it sounded like something from Portal
*Ponies47 Squees
<singsong> God where did Summer go? School starts August 6th for me.
<BroKnee> Bronysith I have fraps >:3
<cachi01> is amnesia really that scary or is everyone overreacting like they do with MLD
<Ponies47> singsong: Well that sucks :(
<flutter_spin> Radiarc - From the Moon sounds very similar to something from Chrono Cross actually
*AttackPony feels ignored
<Meanwhile> cachi01: MLD.
*Ponies47 Hugs AttackPony
*CountDoofus glomps AttackPony
<flutter_spin> Amnesia is scary, if you get involved.
<BroKnee> cachi01: Its kinda scary but I didnt over react at all to MLD >.> I cried my ass off plain and simple
<Meanwhile> Personally Amnesia loses horror factor when you run at the things with a barrel.
<TheHoodyNinja> singsong: FUCK SUMMER FALL IS GAMING SEASON!
<flutter_spin> If you pour yourself into Amnesia, it will scare you.
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)

<flutter_spin> It is just too much.
<LadyCanary> My next costume? Well, Im not sure D:
<hen3ry> Merican History #42: Vice President Richard Johnson proposed during his term that America should send an expedition to the North Pole... for the purpose of drilling to the center of the Earth from there.

<Ryunosuke> lol Cypresswolf
*Vordox scratches the hoof on the ground, sparking some fires while doing it while glaring at Meanwhile.
<Jim> Man I wanna play DayZ, but I'll wait until Arma 2 is on sale on steam
*Meanwhile pitches a cinderblock at Vordox's face. "Stop that"
*AttackPony watches the ensuing chaos
*Vordox headbangs it to smithereen.
<flutter_spin> LOL Family Guy

<hen3ry> Merican History #135: When Richard Nixon had to select a running mate, he passed over many other names before settling on Spiro Agnew. Agnew got the nomination because he was, in Nixon's words, "a political eunuch."
<Irish_Pony> Do I detect RP??????
<Ponies47> RAWRity: I'm only 14! I can't drive! :[
<Meanwhile> Irish_Pony: Can't be, you aren't doing anything.
<LadyCanary> In my neighborhood, these idjits set off fireworks ALL DAMN NIGHT
<RAWRity> Ponies47: steal a car.
<AttackPony> Meanwhile, Vordox: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1556/
<CriticKitten> Hrrrrrrm.
<Vordox> Feelings of fear of being forever shoved away for being unique is not interesting, or of concern. A person you do not know is in distress, and you do NOT care? Are you even a human being?!
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Ponies47: You can drive, just not legally.
<Ponies47> RAWRity: I'm home alone with no other cars :P
<hen3ry> pff, I could drive at 14. Just not legally. xD

<AttackPony> Ponies47: You wouldn't download and steal a car....
<hen3ry> heh
<Meanwhile> Vordox: Eenope. I'm a rock. S'up.
<LadyCanary> Yahooz: Wait...Coney Island?
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: in my neighborhood some teens decided to fire a bottlerocket into a powerline. They missed and set a tree on fire instead.
<hen3ry> great minds and fools think alike
<Yahooz> LadyCanary: Playland
<CriticKitten> Oh, right, I left the Wii on, didn't I? I still need to unify Japan another....what, four times before I unlock Nobunaga? Rawr. >_>;
<LadyCanary> OMG Yahooz IM GOING THERE NEXT MONTH
<LadyCanary> With my campers

<LadyCanary> YESSSS
<Ryunosuke> Cypresswolf, I bet it has lots of pinkie pie in it doesnt it? :)
*Vordox takes a deep breath and sighs, looking dissapointed at the rock. "Am I starting to talk to rocks...when will I lose it."
<LadyCanary> Thats horrible RAWRity D:
<Yahooz> wait
<Yahooz> in rye right?
<Meanwhile> Yahooz: Isn't that where they filmed The Warriors?
<Ryunosuke> Vordox, when Tom talks back :)
*Prismwind looks back into his eyes, smiling a bit shyly still, leaning against him slightly.
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: s'okay. not the dumbest thing I've seen in the place.
<LadyCanary> Yes Yes Yahooz :3
<Vordox> Ryunosuke: Didn't he do that in Anthology?
<Cypresswolf> Not just Pinkie Pie, Ryunosuke :)
<flutter_spin> I'm a little nervous. I think I'm going to meet up with some bronies down in TN
<Yahooz> o_0
<Ryunosuke> probbably
<LadyCanary> Also, has Saxy been around? I miss him
<RAWRity> One time, I saw a pair of guys spend 4 hours outside throwing rocks at a light-pole, trying to smash the bulb.
<Yahooz> omg i could definently go the same day
<CriticKitten> He was here earlier.
<RAWRity> The never hit it.
<ScootaChicken> LadyCanary: He's online in our skype group allll the time
<Yahooz> Depends though
<Yahooz> i might have sailing
<ScootaChicken> And I think he was here earlier as well.
<AttackPony> RAWRity: Introduce those idiots to a belt and a switch.
<LadyCanary> Hm.
<Cypresswolf> I'll pm the link for those who want it :)
<RAWRity> AttackPony: they've since moved away.
<AttackPony> RAWRity: Welp, less idiots.
<User0> Yay, everything works!
<Fou_Lou> Night everypony
<RAWRity> Nother kid actually broke through the wall of their neighbor's house and tried to rob the place in the middle of the night.
<Ponies47> RAWRity: WOW! :O
<RAWRity> this is the world I live in.
<AttackPony> Whover just pinged me, send it again. Flash crashed.
<RAWRity> where thieves say "Hey, you know what's easier than breaking a window? TEARING DOWN A WALL.
<Chrysalis> broke THROUGH the wall
<RAWRity> "

<ScootaChicken> I watched the new Spiderman film yesterday.
<ScootaChicken> What I saw of it was pretty good.
<Ponies47> ScootaChicken: Awesome. I'll have to go see it
<CriticKitten> LadyCanary: Oh god that would be scariest cosplay. But Oichi is awesome. I kinda want Midna to show up in Super Smash Bros with an Oichi moveset, that would be... <3
<CountDoofus> Meanwhile: Sea ponies episode. Hooves down.
<ScootaChicken> Mind you, it was for a date, so my main attention was focused on other things.
<LadyCanary> But I wants a Nagamasa

<Lightning-Quill> I am not a fan of Dream Theater
<Bronysith> RAWRity: nice
<cachi01> dream theater is cool
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Wall link.
<cachi01> not a big fan but its really cool
<mitamaking> Dream Theater?
<cyber_pony13> RAWRity: haave some fun with them
<cachi01> RAWRity: aww shit
<LadyCanary> Yus, mitamaking :3
<RAWRity> Bronysith: we thenk soaked all of those in gasoline, covered them in hay, and light the whole thing on fire with a home-made flame-thrower made out of a supersoaker.
<LadyCanary> D: Why not Lightning-Quill
<mitamaking> No, what is Dream Theater?
<LadyCanary> :O
<cachi01> mitamaking: a band
<mitamaking> oh
<LadyCanary> Dream Theater is a fantastic band.
<Bronysith> RAWRity: um.... AWESOME /)^3^*(\
<LadyCanary> Not sure what kind of metal though
<cyber_pony13> RAWRity: that sounds very unsafe....oh well it the fourth so have fun with that
<mitamaking> RAWRity: Is that legal in your state?
<cachi01> LadyCanary: i think its nu-metal
<Prismwind> (( Sorry for long reply waits, half doing stuff offline ))
<LadyCanary> ....
<StinkomanFan> www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr4SHEQzpqQ I only faved this video so I could share it with you guys
*LadyCanary slaps cachi01 OH HELL NO
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: I'd class them more as proggressive rock than anything metal.
<Lightning-Quill> My friend talks too much about it and I do not like a lot of his taste in music except some bands
<Bronysith> mitamaking: screw the rules he has money
<LadyCanary> Progressive metal.
<cyber_pony13> LadyCanary: i think dreamtheater is more as proggressive rock/metal
<mitamaking> If those were expensive he might not
<cachi01> LadyCanary: HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY
<LadyCanary> nu metal is like freaking Limp Bizkit, who I HATE.
<Lightning-Quill> Lately I prefer electronic i'm tired of metal too slow for my tastes
<Prismwind> What...? *stays relaxed against him, still a bit shy herself though, looking into his eyes with that shy little smile of hers*
<cachi01> LadyCanary: system of a down is nu-metal
<ScootaChicken> LadyCanary: Oh god not Limp Bizkit
<Liokin> -lol......bizkit....
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm thinking about getting a messenger bag with derpy on it

<Liokin> fluttercry: Then you sir. Are on the same thinking level as mine self.
<Meanwhile> Bronysith: It is?
<LadyCanary> Wanna listen to fast metal? Listen to DEATH. They're the first Death metal band, who's lead guitarist and singer was JEWISH AND FROM BROOKLYN
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: not necessarily. Limp Bizkit is rap-rock. Nu-metal is more "Metal, with pop sensibilties"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> fluttercry i got it, it's nice :3
<StinkomanFan> Yes Jim, feel the fear flow through you
<fluttercry> 05,15I loves me some messenger bags.
<Jim> Bronysith: Isn't that everyone's theme song?
<Lightning-Quill> Not exactly what i meant. I more or less find too many depressing songs in metal
<fluttercry> 05,15They're so useful

<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: No shit I knew that but I didn't know that was actually a name.
*oni_link is lost just like Dken2021
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Untill I get a better computer I'm not gonna downlaod MLP online
<cyber_pony13> Reikim: oh really which one from the X series or the MMZ series
<ScootaChicken> LadyCanary: Yarp.
<Bronysith> and thus Meanwhile was born http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3703/
<Reikim> ScootaChicken: I can relate. Dad's chinese, and my grandparents gave me a Chinese name that I can't even pronounce.
<LadyCanary> Holy sheet
<Reikim> cyber_pony13: Both.
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: Wait is Chungwangfangtang a real name?
<ScootaChicken> Meanwhile: Probably.
<RAWRity> inb4 ScootaChicken is making stuff up to make everypony look racist
<ScootaChicken> LadyCanary: *Horry
<Meanwhile> Because if so I'm changing one of mine to it.
<cyber_pony13> oni_link: hopefully otherwise we got necromorphs everywhere:O
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: Wish I was.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Hey guys, would like to show you myself ponified. His wings are up to show the cutie mark better. http://i45.tinypic.com/2qlu3cp.png
<ScootaChicken> Being Chinese sucks, mum forces me to play the violin and piano and shit
<Spade-Magnes[R]> That buffalo pokemon in gen 5 looks rediculace
<ScootaChicken> And when I suck at Maths she rages at me
*ReticentSmolder 5,15The spine reads, 'Of the Metaphysical Repercussions Concerning the Use of Magic and Modern Writing' and a large silk thread is holding a well worn page open for him as he sits on a bench facing the fountain.

<Reikim> RAWRity: /)
<RAWRity> Big_Macintosh_1992: why is your CM the logo from Jackie Chan Adventures?
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: Please, I wish I'd been forced to do something when I was younger. I'd probably be less of a miserable talentless dead-end.
<Cypresswolf> I havent thought of this video in years! Just now came to mind with RAWRity's previos video - Chocobo Robo Voice - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1MRcK0HBpg
<Meanwhile> Fuck that was a depressing sentence.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Well hen3ry Big Mac is my fav. character but I like the pegusi
<Big_Macintosh_1992> RAWRity: its the Mortal Kombat Logo
<Dken2021> RAWRity you're joking right?
<Reikim> ScootaChicken: You are chinese. You are not allowed to suck at maths.
<CCCP> Theres a miqueto in here and its annoying me, but i don't want to kill her!!! WAT DO!! :((((

<ScootaChicken> This should be fun.
<Dken2021> from all the complaints I hear about adobe flash, I guess I shouldn't update then

<RX-78-SweetieBot> Otakon, did you see the buffs to Cerberus?
<otakon> RAWRity: I am a bear.
<CCCP> Why is every one talking about America today?
<ScootaChicken> otakon: Yeah, you might not want to be here right now, we might start igniting the urge to lynch someone in you.
<Meanwhile> otakon: Was meant to be on an hour ago.
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: enope, and hiya
<Cypresswolf> I had a video with Psycho Twilight zoning out listening to that song, but got deleted months ago :) Shame really, always got the best O_o reactions :D
<cyber_pony13> CCCP: i dont think rarity would let a mosquito do that to her especially knowing all the things you can get from them
<Reikim> So now otakon's a French bear-dwarf on fire. Who is also drunk.
<otakon> ScootaChicken: oh really?
<RAWRity> otakon: I don't think you know which kind of bear I'm refering to

<RX-78-SweetieBot> otakon: I'll post them in the skype
<otakon> RX-78-SweetieBot: danke

<Dark92Enigma> HAPPY 4TH OF JULY, American Bronies
<CCCP> Dken2021 :P
<oni_link> Thanks Dark92Enigma :)
<cyber_pony13> CCCP: it significant to us because it when we could say we are our own country plus we take it to honor all those who've served and sacrifice for our country
<CCCP> Why are people patriotic anyway? i don't get it
<Meanwhile> You can fight like a Krogan, run like a leopard but you'll never be better than Commander Shepard.
<Reikim> Yes, my American buddies, I hope you are enjoying this fourth day of the month of July. I hear the parties are fantastic.
<CCCP> cyber_pony13: yeah yeah, i know
<Meanwhile> Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious.
<ScootaChicken> Dark92Enigma: Happy day when Americans celebrate beating us Brits?
<ScootaChicken> Sure thing.
<oni_link> Reikim: Indeed they are :P
<Dken2021> also another excuse to get drunk in july
*Nelaj yawns "Nothing to do..." he ponders "I guess I'll see what's going on elsewhere." he dashes to the courtyard noticing Ret and rushing over to him "Hiya! I'm Nelaj. What's your name?"
<ScootaChicken> (douchebags)
<RAWRity> Reikim: the barbeques are great
*Dark92Enigma Happy Independence Day, let's celebrate with ''Independence Day''
<cyber_pony13> CCCP: then why you XD
<ScootaChicken> Independence Day was a good film.
<CCCP> The 4th of July is POINTLESS! :[
<ScootaChicken> Because you got to see America getting blown up dohohoho
<Reikim> Us Canadians have something similar. The alcohol is traditional, you see: when the Canadians signed their independance from the Empire, they celebrated with literally a boatload of booze.
<Bronysith> CCCP: it is to celebrate old america instead of this new bullshit stuff
<Nelaj> Birdy gets a memory of what Nelaj said "Don't get too crazy now." ((Because I can))
<Dark92Enigma> ScootaChicken I can't tell, i'm Chilean but i respect all the nations equally
*ReticentSmolder 5,15"Reticent, I'm usually holed up in my room." He points to the large dome-like structure on the roof with a giant window.
<CCCP> Bronysith implying america was ever good..
<ScootaChicken> Dark92Enigma: You're one up on otakon then.
<oni_link> ScootaChicken: but, our countries are allies :(
<Bronysith> CCCP: exactly!
<Dark92Enigma> ScootaChicken Why?
*Nelaj looks up "...Wow. How did I not notice that before?"
<Reikim> Mmm, I prefer to appreciate people, not nations. Because let's face it, there are a lot of good people living in countries with crappy governments.
<ScootaChicken> Dark92Enigma: You should hear about the things otakon wants to do to black people.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So many explosions outside.
<ScootaChicken> Trust me, it ain't pretty.
<oni_link> Reikim: so true
<otakon> ScootaChicken: what?
*ReticentSmolder 5,15"Well you can really only see it from the center of the courtyard."
<Dken2021> I can't even see the fireworks where I am
<otakon> ScootaChicken: WHAT?
<hen3ry> Reikim: and the vice versa would be true, if there were any non-crappy governments.
<CCCP> Well i must admit i saw the moon today and it was freaking RED!
<ScootaChicken> Ohai otakon.
<Meanwhile> otakon is the worst pony.
*AttackPony lurks
<Reikim> CCCP: Where do you live that the moon is surprising?
*ReticentSmolder 5,15looks around, "Which seems to be vacant more often than not."
*Birdy works his hooves all over, gradually working his way to her stomach. Birdy is slightly straddling her as he works, actually doing a good job of massaging her.
<Dark92Enigma> ScootaChicken, you're trolling on otakon OR what you say is right?
<CCCP> Reikim: Mars
*Birdy shakes the thought from his head.
<Dark92Enigma> otakon is it true?
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: dear God no
<Meanwhile> Red sky at night, shepards delight.
<Reikim> CCCP: Mars has like three moons.
<hen3ry> 2
<oni_link> One more hour... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I needs my phone
<LadyCanary> Same here, Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Two moons.
<otakon> brb need a drink
<Meanwhile> Red sky in the morning, thatched cottage on fire at the end of the village.
<Reikim> Thanks Nitt
<hen3ry> and I think both Martian moons are too small to be seen with the naked eye from the Martian surface
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Phobos and Deimos.
<Reikim> This chat is DED.
*Nelaj looks around "...Yeah. I was hoping more ponies would be here. But at least I get to meet a new one!"
*Prismwind slowly rolls on her back to let him get to her stomach, eyes closed, relaxing completely under him, smiling softly
<Meanwhile> Homophobos.
<AttackPony> BRBRBRBRBR
<Dark92Enigma> otakon Not that i would doubt it....but why the rumour?
<oni_link> Meanwhile: hahaha
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh Meanwhile. :p
<Meanwhile> :3
<Reikim> Hey look, I learned something today.
<oni_link> :P
<ScootaChicken> ...Wait a minute
<Reikim> I should really start coming here regularly again.
<oni_link> Reikim: What?
<ScootaChicken> I just listened to American Girl by Tom Petty
<ScootaChicken> That's a really dirty innuendo in the chorus.
<Reikim> oni_link: Mars has two moons, named Phobos and Deimos.
<Reikim> ScootaChicken: ?
*ReticentSmolder 5,15chuckles, "I'm more of a facet of the architecture here now than a new face huh? I've been around since this place was an empty plot. Now look at all the full plot around you!" He winks lewdly
<Dark92Enigma> ScootaChicken He (otakon) denied it
<CCCP> I also don't get the american flag...
<ScootaChicken> Reikim: Oh yeah, Oh right, take it easy baby, we can last all night.
<oni_link> Reikim: oh that. *face hoofs themself*
<ScootaChicken> Yep.
<ScootaChicken> Totally kosher.
<CCCP> its like the british Flag but less interesting
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: ofc I denied it, bc I'm not racist
<Meanwhile> Someone should stream...something. Anything. Just put me out of this boredom loop.
<ScootaChicken> otakon: But why do you hate Negromancers then?
<cachi01> i think i finished my oc
<Dken2021> CCCP the stars represent the states, the stripes represent the original colonies
<Dark92Enigma> otakon I Know, but my question is Who spreaded the rumor
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Eyup.
<hen3ry> And the field represents the corporations that own them all?
<CCCP> Dken2021 what does the red white and blur represent?
<RAWRity> silly otakon. everyone knows that saying youre not racist is the fastest way to prove you're racist
<CCCP> blue*
<Prismwind> (( Gotta love dem plot holes XD ))
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Almost. "I'm not racist, but..." that's the fastest way.
<otakon> RAWRity: the hell.
<Nelaj> ((I see what you did there))
<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: 'I'm not racist, I just don't like black people.'
<CCCP> its kind of true lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Next year, the 50 stars will be replaced by 50 corporate logos, each a political sponsor.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p

<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: I see you've read "Infinite Jest" eh?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ScootaChicken: "I'm not racist, I'm just otakon."
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<AttackPony> Hello GabeMoist
<otakon> Dark92Enigma: it's from LC one day overhearing me on Skype saying I hate Necromancers. He twisted my words into something different and the mayhem began.. Guess what word?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just a cynical view.

<Meanwhile> fluttercry: Well according to the position of the horsehead nebula from betelgeuse, the number of echidna's currently found in mainland Europe, and the number of stitches in Danny Osmonds pants...maybe.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01salutes the sickle and star
<Reikim> Also yes, assuming there is a soul.
<CCCP> Nittany_Discord: yay
*ReticentSmolder 5,15sighs and puts his bookmark in place before tucking it into his saddle bag. "I'm just not the type of pony to get involved with that anymore... And yes, well, with Silver's help of course."
<Reikim> Also souls can be sold
*CCCP feels happy
*Prismwind nesstles softly to his side, kissing his cheek softly. "You're so sweet to me."
<hen3ry> Nittany_Discord: do the men from Kazakhstan make your blocks tho?
<Meanwhile> I didn't cry when I was born. That's a sign of not having a soul.
<kirzstryfe> I think they just cease to exist as opposed to dying
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> what are you guys talking about?
<Reikim> Multiple times, although that makes for an awkward situation when the buyers come to collect.

*Nelaj still questioning "Silver?"

*ReticentSmolder 5,15"Oh, I nearly forgot. Here's my card." His horn shimmers and a business card plinks out of thin air, slowly rotating in place. A picture of Reticent and the instructions are printed on it's front.

*Birdy smiles and kisses her back, "Only because y' deserve it...."

<AttackPony> Nicole is a man!
<oni_link> AttackPony: I drooled myself, the new maps and Google now , oh lawd :3
<Reikim> On a related note, otakon is a chatbot!
*ReticentSmolder 5,15'If something happens to you here and I can help then don't hesitate to burn this card. Stand back, results are imminent and may vary.'
<AttackPony> oni_link: Sweet Celestia!

<Reikim> otakon: A chatbot would say just that!
<AttackPony> Reikim: No, a chat bot would probably troll
<otakon> Reikim: what do I have to do to prove I'm not a chatbot?
*ReticentSmolder 5,15"There's a bit of my magic in every one of those cards, so keep it safe until you need me."

<ScootaChicken> RX-78-SweetieBot: I have a girlfriend now, must repress lustful urges.
<CCCP> How can people like scootaloo more than Sweetiee belle?
<Reikim> otakon: Because we're all bored and it would be amusing?
<LadyCanary> Be right back~
<ScootaChicken> So I'm afraid Nicole shall have to wait for another man to satisfy her urges.
<oni_link> Ponies47: Nope :P
<AttackPony> oni_link: It's a site that has all the news concerning and iOS platforms and Android/Google
<Ponies47> oni_link: Ohai. Thanks mate :)

<ScootaChicken> RAWRity: I found Peter Parker in the new one more relatable, because in this one he was just your standard hormonal teenage douchebag,
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^-^
<ScootaChicken> Also, he was British.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dusts SuperBrony64

<Meanwhile> I heard otakon sucked balls.
<Ponies47> oni_link: Fireworks? Fireworks are banned in Wisconsin due to no rain :(
*Nelaj "You need some training. And a family history of magic users."
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Ponies47: wow that sucks
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why didn't they keep the last Spiderman timeline going?
<otakon> mistake, one HALF step above the Green Lantern movie
<Ponies47> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: IKR?
<ScootaChicken> otakon, what the fuck does jump her bones mean.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or was that going to be a bad idea?
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: bc no one wanted to do it anymore
<RAWRity> otakon: I've heard the oppisite. Everyone I've seen keeps saying it's tons better than the Raimi films.
<Reikim> Really, what the hell does that even mean?
<oni_link> Ponies47: We're badasses in my neighborhood. :D

<Vordox> Guys I'm trying to find a video
<ScootaChicken> otakon: Tell me what 'jump her bones' means or I'll start a new meme about you.
<CCCP> heres a funny joke: A man walks into a bar, he is an alcoholic and is ruining his family.
<Reikim> The last movie Spiderman timeline was okay, but Parker was kind of whiny towards the end. He didn't have the casual danger dialogue that makes Spiderman awesome.
<AttackPony> I can not see the entire chat locked inside of a school. I just CAN'T.
<GabeMoist> it means her jump on her bones
<Vordox> MLP FIM related, where we see someone commenting on Twilight's Sparkle saddest cry in the finale of S2.
<RAWRity> I've eyt to see spider-man, but the promotional material I've seen so far has made me dread the dialogue. Good GOD was that stuff bad.
<Shizuka> 13i am confused by this channel
<ScootaChicken> Guys
<Vordox> "Look at that face, it's torn apart"
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: To jump someones bones means you want to tap that.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6how young do you have to be to not understand that saying?
<ScootaChicken> What does 'Jump her bones' mean?
<Reikim> I'm excited to see the return of web shooters, but this one has Gwen Stacy, and we all know what that means...
<Meanwhile> Dude I just told you in mane
*Bronysith glomps kirzstryfe
<Meanwhile> Pay attention.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I never heard of jumping someone's bones.
<otakon> he's 15
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Nail didnt know what that means?
*AttackPony hugs kirzstryfe
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Dear god jailbait
<Reikim> Shizuka: This channel is ded, that's why.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I'm 29.
<otakon> he's at the age he should of heard of it by now
*Nelaj "Well...My family specializes in alchemy which requires some knowledge of magic. But...I didn't want to follow my family tredition."
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: you're sheltered than
*otakon has an old soul at 28.
<CCCP> So a Hispanic, African-American, Jewish, and Asian man were walking down the street. They were involved in a parade that celebrated racial equality.
<Reikim> Jailbait? When did jailbait come into it?
*Bronysith gives kirzstryfe caffeine
<FlareChaser> Nittany_Discord: Really? always thought you were in your mid-twenties..
<Spade-Magnes[R]> http://derpy.me/gIyk0

<Mutterguy|SLP> No stream right?
<Ryunosuke> are we...
<ScootaChicken> otakon: I'm also British. We don't say 'I'd like to jump her bones'. We say 'Oi'd fuckin' give her a right good shaggin'.'
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've heard of getting leg.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> ScootaChicken is always the jailbait
<Dken2021> is that another term for gang up?
<Meanwhile> ScootaChicken: amen.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> you should know this
<AttackPony> I think most of us find that out by 16 at least nowadays
<Ryunosuke> doing the horizontal hokey pokey?
<otakon> ScootaChicken: god, that sounds worse.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6it's not an energy thing Bronysith, I'm just tired

<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Ryunosuke> Shizuka... BoB?
<FlareChaser> kirzstryfe: if you're tired why don't you go to bed? I'm sure you had a busy day~
*Prismwind mmms and nuzzles at his cheek, smiling shyly. "Maybe we should climb in bed instead of laying here in the middle of the hallway."
<otakon> Reikim: getting flaxen haired maidens to "Shine your shield" eh? *wink, wink, nudge, nudge*
<Mutterguy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDA9NbPAK8o <something suitably patriotic

<Ryunosuke> also, not sure that was a wise phrase there
<Reikim> RAWRity: What planet?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not sure I can resist hugging Shizuka before BoB starts.
<ScootaChicken> Reikim: I was 14 when these guys first met me, hence jailbait.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6still too early for bed
<oni_link> AttackPony: So did I, they need to be more consistant with their updates :/
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Shizuka

<ScootaChicken> Doesn't get better.
<otakon> Ryunosuke: huh? why not?

<oni_link> hello SolairePony89
<Shizuka> 13a la http://fav.me/d4mizjq and http://fav.me/d4t822i
<cachi01> Saturn: damn

<Unnr> Saturn, I once was heading a small two day anime con... and the rest of the comittie quit 48 hours before the doors opened
<oni_link> Bronysith: needs more turnips :D
<SolairePony89> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: A few probably
<Saturn> 08,01it's costing about £14,000 to put on
<Mutterguy> Saturn i'm pretty sure theres no brony convention within 10,000 km of me
<Saturn> 08,01all in all
<Unnr> annnd I can´t spell

<AttackPony> The closest thing to a brony convention down here is NashiCon, RoundCon and BanzaiCon
<Shizuka> 13or at least write ships..
<Mutterguy> I'm counting Australia as well seeing as flights can be as low as $100
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr: oh dear
<RAWRity> seeing as most WW2 vets would be in their 70's by the time the first CoD came out, I think we can count them out of having played it.
<oni_link> Bronysith: thanks for that -_-
<Bronysith> Saturn: were you bitten by that zombie sheep?
<Reikim> Hey, can I write something for Bronystate? I'm tired which does funny things to my mind.

<cachi01> finally official plush---------*looks at plushies* dafuq is this shit
<Reikim> cachi01: Rule of pony fandom: The custom fanmade stuff will always be better than official merch.
<otakon> SolairePony89: eeyup, but it's no damn different than watching TV. but there is NOTHING ON TV therefore I play a game. I've only been getting on the PC at night for the streams this week

<SolairePony89> Dovah: Episode 8
<Alchemist> Thanks and hi SolairePony89 :)
<Dovah> k thanks SolairePony89
<Lightning-Quill> Ahh finished reading a 12 chapter fanfic that is incomplete so cliffhanger
<Alchemist> Its been a while since I've last seen this series. Best WW2 on screen IMO.
<SolairePony89> otakon: Not being employed isn't totally your fault, especially if you've tried as much as you have. And in this job market it's even more difficult
<FlareChaser> Seems Legit.
<otakon> brb mom got home, want to say hi
<cachi01> anyone else thinks super PINGAS wrold should be streamed sometime?
<otakon> nvm not her
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> to bother or not to bother val ... uhmm
<cachi01> world*
<otakon> friend of Craig's
<Mirage> (okie)
<Shizuka> 13welp
<Metal_Gear_Jazz> Wb, anyway.
<Shizuka> 13first fire engine of the night
<xMLPxREACTORx> never seen it
<otakon> Shizuka: someone got a little too patriotic eh?
<cachi01> super PINGAS world is a game
<SaxyPretender> 0,14probably not while he's streaming
<Reikim> Yeah, best not to bug Val while he's streaming.
<otakon> okay this is weird
<Lightning-Quill> Hmm no fireworks. I'm dissappointed
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Very well
<otakon> I got a Mists Of Panderia Beta invitaton
<otakon> and I'm NOT on WoW
<SolairePony89> Ha
<otakon> this is odd
<SolairePony89> otakon: You use to though I'm guessing?
<Jim> A house burned down to the ground here today
<cachi01> otakon: i got a god of war 3 beta code when i didnt even knew there was a beta sign up
<otakon> SolairePony89: enope, I didn't have an account with them. My cousin did and we shared it on the same PC
<Dovah> Jim: wut happend?

<Jim> No idea, they're still investigating it
<SolairePony89> Jim: I know it's the 4th and all but that's just a bit extreme
<Dovah> :P
<Jim> we don't celebrate 4th over here
<Birdy> *Soft leaves his room and takes a step intobthe parlor, his scarred face looks grim and even worse than usual.*
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yeah... bugging Val at all right now would be ill-advised
<ricecakery> I live in Las Vegas so there are plenty of fireworks but a lot are banned
<Cypresswolf> I have my Grandpa's army issued portable tray & silverware somewhere in this house - Dad used to take it on every camping trip we took - consists of a 3 part tray with a cover, knife, fork & spoon
<Reikim> Bugging Val period is ill-advised.
<Cypresswolf> at least 50 years old most likely over 60 by now
<otakon> I had the same thing Cypresswolf

<SolairePony89> otakon: Weird how YOU got the beta key and not him. Methinks they might be tracking your PC :P
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Yep
<Dovah> QQ is it possible to pm someone on here? need 2 know for futere refrence.
<Hammer> *There was a bit of paper pinned to Hammer's door the day following his arrival*
<otakon> SolairePony89: but it's a different PC too
<Jim> Dovah: Just type /query namehere
<Dovah> Jim: k thanks
<SolairePony89> otakon: Pretty good tracking then :P

<RAWRity> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m694ygQf6c1qi3k37o1_500.jpg
<Reikim> ...Eat a hat?
<Cypresswolf> I need to look for his tapes - some of them may have his war stories I never asked him about - didnt think it polite to ask
<Hammer> If you wanna rp Mirage, now would work)
<Alchemist> Im quite ignorant about US history so please dont jump on me. What I would like to ask is were there at any point military drafting or has the US armed forces always been voluntary?
<Liokin> *gasp*n they have the state of the art can technology alarm system....the mad geniuses....
<Mirage> Give me a couple minutes. )
<Shizuka> 13give you two buds for that eaten hat
<otakon> Alchemist: Draft was on in WW2
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, there have been drafts before
<Reikim> Buds? Hat?
*Reikim is confused
<SaxyPretender> 0,14most (in)famously for Vietnam
<otakon> ^
<Alchemist> infamously?
<otakon> bc Vietnam was another war we had NO GODDAMN BUSINESS OF BEING IN
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Val may have said there would be no attractive girls in cosplay at BronyCon
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hats -> TF2
<Hammer> aight)
<RAWRity> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5tvnae2ja1qi3k37o1_500.jpg

<SolairePony89> otakon: But... BUT COMMUNISM!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and that he'd eat his hat otherwise
<Reikim> No attractive cosplay
<otakon> SolairePony89: let em have it
<Cypresswolf> Alchemist: last draft issued was Vietnam
<Reikim> Bit of an oxymoron there
<otakon> they didn't learn from Vietnam, they won't learn from Iraq
*Nelaj is chilling in the parlor

<Kandarihu> Derpy_Hooves, that's awesome
<Reikim> Asuka cosplayers tend towards deliciousness.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14either way, she's pretty
<Alchemist> fluttercry: I presume you have checked out the most known ones like 087 and 173 ;)
*Sylandest hugs Liokin, SolairePony89, otakon

<SonataOctavia> Hey everypony
<Sylandest> howdy, SonataOctavia
<AttackPony> Hay everyone, I'm back from dishes
*Lone_Lycan smiles halfway
<RX-78-SweetieBot> What about Mari cosplays?
<SolairePony89> WB AttackPony
<Quick_Thinker> BUT WE STILL SHOT EM OFF AHAHAHAHAHA
<Alchemist> fluttercry: make sure to check out the backstories too on the scp website. Makes it even scarier.
<Phase4> 00,02fluttercry, i was actually confused for a moment because scp is a command on most linux systems used for copying files via ssh
<Reikim> Mari is just sex period, so...
<Sylandest> Lone_Lycan: ahhhh, come on, you got a bigger smile than that! :D
<Liokin> AttackPony: Sup /)

<AttackPony> Liokin: Nothing much. (\
<Shizuka> 13mari is a blank slate
<fluttercry> 05,15ah. That would make sense if I was in any way technically literate
<SolairePony89> Hiyo Quick_Thinker
<Reikim> fluttercry: Whatever the HELL you do, do NOT play that game. EVER.
<Quick_Thinker> and not fuck da police WE GOT A PERMIT
<Shizuka> 13no character development...
<Shizuka> 13just there to be fanservice and nothing more
<Lightning-Quill> what is scp it sounds scary and I love scary ( no I'm not creepy just weird)
<Shizuka> 13and they dropped a bridge on asuka to do it
*Lone_Lycan shakes his head. 1"Nope,... story of my life... always alone."
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Sinfest? mari ? wat ?
<Reikim> Eh, some characters don't need development.
<Liokin> RAWRity: Got any alluring Twilight Sparkle? Im in the market for a new wallpaper.
<Reikim> Although I have to confess
*Mirage is walking back from the fillys room in the direction of hers and hammers rooms
<SolairePony89> Quick_Thinker: Aww. Would of been cooler if ya did FUCK DA POLICE
<Reikim> I'm also mixing her up with the Nobody Dies Mari
<Cypresswolf> fluttercry: Never in the dark & Never before bed!
<Reikim> Who is very much developed as a character, to a point.
<fluttercry> 05,15It's dark...and I have to go to sleep soon....challenge accepted
<Phase4> 00,02fluttercry, it meens to copy files in a way that meens no one can modify it betwene you and the computer you're connecting to or see what it is
<Quick_Thinker> i have the comic con 2012 poster as my backgrounf but i think i need some fan made art as well
<Reikim> Shizuka: Asuka's not dead yet. She comes back badass with an eyepatch.
<fluttercry> 05,15ahhh okay.
<Phase4> 00,02if they try, it errors
<AttackPony> What you guys talking about "never before bed"
<RAWRity> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m436skeVQe1qi3k37o1_500.jpg
<Alchemist> Lightning-Quill: its a made up collection of super secret paranormal phenomenon, some of those were made into short indie games.
<Shizuka> 13http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/w1hri/between_seasons_by_loceri/c59et8s
<Cypresswolf> fluttercry: :) Good luck turning the lights out afterward
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Mari seemed pretty bloodthirsty and insane to me.
<Lightning-Quill> I'm alraedy surrounded by darkness covered in a small vlanket and scary stuff me gusta
<Xaiden> Why the fuck did that dumbass run into that ROOM
<Reikim> Again, I have a tendency to mix her up with the Nobody Dies Mari, so that explains that
<Quick_Thinker> so any ponys play SSX or am i the only one :?
<Alchemist> Lightning-Quill: : http://www.scp-wiki.net/ they have about 2000 stories.
<Xaiden> When he KNEW that their was a live grenade
<RX-78-SweetieBot> But, yeah, she didnt get much development
*Nelaj notices Soft "Jeez. The heck happened to him?"
<Phase4> 00,02little insane in that room
<Reikim> She might in the next movie.
<cachi01> Quick_Thinker: ssx is awesome!!
<Spriggals> No shit.
<Lightning-Quill> Yay thank you
<Quick_Thinker> YEAH IT IS
<SolairePony89> Phase4: Just a bit
<Reikim> I like that she's badass, but I like her potential more.
<AttackPony> Alchemist: Oh, you're talking about SCP? Which ones?
<Quick_Thinker> what happened to him?>
<Vordox> Lung Collapse...
<SolairePony89> Quick_Thinker: Friendly grenade
<Alchemist> AttackPony: 087 ad 173 of course :) I've read many more but those were the best so far.

<Quick_Thinker> ohh damn D:
<Bronysith> that is why you have him sit up
<Reikim> Mari is one of those characters that makes me go "She's such a badass!...but who the hell IS she?"
<Cypresswolf> :'( that parts gets me everytime
<Bronysith> RAWRity: wow
<AttackPony> Alchemist: Those are the only ones they have games of so far.
<Liokin> Play him off boys....
<Bronysith> oh hi wrek
<AttackPony> Wait, what happened to that dude.
<Quick_Thinker> you know on most site when people post links i ignore them but this site i look at them all
<Shizuka> 13asuka was on track for far better development this time around
<FlareChaser> Hello Wrek~
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and a friend of mine has decided that she is gonna cosplay this: http://derpy.me/9wb1T
<Bronysith> AttackPony: he caught the disease of death
<Shizuka> 13but NOPE WE MUST HAVE A CHARACTER THAT FITS EVERY OTAKU FANTASY RIGHT NOW
<Reikim> She still is
<AttackPony> Hello Wrek
<otakon> brb again
<Alchemist> AttackPony: yep, but its because those have stories that can be made into a game.
<Reikim> Asuka's still on track for good development!
<Liokin> AttackPony: He charge at his own grenade and got shrapnel to the face. He then proceeded to bleed out.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you gotta admit
<AttackPony> Liokin: Ewww *shudder*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BRB
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it got derailed like fuck
<Liokin> AttackPony: Not enough blood brain stops responding. Lungs cease....slow death.
<Reikim> That was the point, Saxy.
<Phase4> 00,02to be fair
<Phase4> 00,02he ran into a grenade
<SaxyPretender> 0,14"Hey, I'm going to be a better person!"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>dead
<Reikim> Rebuild is supposed to be derailed
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm watching PewDiePie play the SCP games. They look freaky
<RX-78-SweetieBot> If they wanted to go full pandering it would be more like the K-on extreme moe stuff
<Reikim> Also Asuka's not dead
<Liokin> Phase4: His OWN grenade.
<AttackPony> Alchemist: Don't the other SCPs have stories to them? I'd like to experience 264 myself
<SolairePony89> So thus, his own fault
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and that was the point where I stopped giving a fuck
<Phase4> 00,02Liokin, that too
<Liokin> Phase4: Thats like rule one of war. Chuck it and cover!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, she isn't
<AttackPony> fluttercry: Which one you watching? 173 or 087-B?
<Reikim> Unlike Tohji, GOD DAMN YOU GAINAX
<Reikim> Tohji had NO REASON to die.
<fluttercry> 05,15173 now
<Lightning-Quill> post link pleae like I said I'm not afraid to see this stuff
<Phase4> 00,02Liokin, i thought rule one was "don't get shot"
<Reikim> Except he did, but I'm still pissed about it so fuck logic.
<AttackPony> fluttercry: Oh his ractions tot hat one is awesooome.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but I really hate when characters get their redemption chance shut
<Liokin> Phase4: Nah nah thats rule 3 :3
<Reikim> Asuka hasn't been shut
<Birdy> *Instantly starts pouring his hard drink*
<Lightning-Quill> Although I'm not stupid enough to use a weegee board
<Shizuka> 13eva is built around that, but it's supposed to pay off in the end
<Reikim> She got shot down in the original.
<Shizuka> 13the wait befween rebuild 2 and 3 is painfully long though
<AttackPony> Lightning-Quill: Which one you want to see? 087-B or 173?
<Cypresswolf> fluttercry: I played scp 87 a few weeks ago - original one with the stairway - got the wierdest nightmare as a result
<Shizuka> 13it's kind of like half life 2
<Shizuka> 13at this point
<OtakuTom> Hi everypony :)
<RAWRity> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m39nqmsLVg1qi3k37o1_500.jpg
<SolairePony89> Hey OtakuTom
<Lightning-Quill> Whayever is scarier
<Reikim> Think about it this way, Shizu: we wait because the animation is so good.
<Shizuka> 13episode 3 will be terrible no matter how much effort went into it
<Alchemist> AttackPony: most of the euclid class are just weird objects. One could make a short movie about them but not a game. (lemme check what 264 is)
<Lightning-Quill> :|
<SolairePony89> Poor German
<Reikim> I mean really
<Reikim> Rebuild's animation is just
<Reikim> I don't even have a word for it
<Shizuka> 13jaja
<kirzstryfe> 8,6another attempt at explaining eva shot to hell because they wouldn't drop the money into it
<Spriggals> If I was that german I would have crawled over to his side by then.
<Reikim> Hey, they explained the original
<fluttercry> 05,15Sooo...is this thing like a weeping angel?
<Shizuka> 13out of uniform again... tsk
<Reikim> End of Eva
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but I'm guessing it won't live up to people's expectations?
<AttackPony> Alchemist: That one is my favorite.
<Cypresswolf> fluttercry: yes
<Reikim> Oh, Eva's fanbase is going to be rabid no matter what they do
<kirzstryfe> 8,6RAWR!
<Reikim> Just like Final Fantasy!
<fluttercry> 05,15my god..
<Quick_Thinker> so tired LETS GET DRUNK BUCK YEAH :[
<AttackPony> fluttercry: Yeah but DON'T. FUCKING. RUN. if it sees you. Your survival rate at that is .1%

<Shizuka> 13X3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh dat kirz
<kirzstryfe> 8,6:3
<Reikim> Seriously though, Eva's fanbase is going to go nuts no matter what the movie does.
<Reikim> If it's too much like the original then they'll complain that it's not creative
<otakon> and back
<Reikim> If it deviates too much they'll complain that it deviated
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that sounds like every fandom ever >.>
<Shizuka> 13it'll be mitigated by eva being obscured enough that no fan theory will be proven right
<Quick_Thinker> i just DRINK STRIGHT UP APPLE JACK DANIALS (i found a ber keep who was a fan nad made his own beer of it XD)
<Alchemist> "...back side of the hemisphere is covered in carvings of several languages, including Arabic, Hebrew, German, and ███████. Translation of the ███████ language has been suspended indefinitely due to [DATA EXPUNGED]" :D I love these little hints.
<Reikim> Gainax is in a lose/lose situation.
<otakon> RAWRity: the hell our those? unfitting captions?
<otakon> Alchemist: the hell?
<RAWRity> otakon: Texts from The Fire Nation
<Cypresswolf> fluttercry: worst thing about 173 is trying to run while facing it the entire time, and watching it gain back its ground everytime you blink O_O
<RAWRity> otakon: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1vgfbJvx71qi3k37o1_500.jpg
<SolairePony89> Going in a second time in a row seems pretty... risky
<Reikim> They cleared up the original though, with the movie.
<Shizuka> 13ah SCP, the desperate attempts to be scary
<Reikim> Which...I still haven't watched >.>
<Alchemist> otakon: its from a scp document.
<Liokin> Alchemist: -lol all I see is white censor bars.
<otakon> Shizuka: what desperate? some of those are pretty good
<kirzstryfe> 8,6thought the movies just left everyone with more wtf's
<AttackPony> fluttercry: Also, if you use headphones: While you're trying to avoid it. If you hear something likes hifting concrete, it KNOWS where you are and it sees you, but you don't know it until you turn around and *neck snap*
<Liokin> Shizuka: You wanna know whats reaaaaallly scary???
<Shizuka> 13Liokin: the thought of justin bieber being president?
<Shizuka> 13oh wait canadian
*Hammer isn't anywhere to be seen
<Shizuka> 13whew... dodged a bullet there..
<Reikim> Nah
<Cypresswolf> fluttercry: did just that on one playthrough, and tried to lock the door, but blinked before hitting the button and locked it in the room with me

<StinkomanFan> My asshole little brother's gonna try and use my lappy for skype
<RAWRity> otakon: she's getting a half-biographical concert movie. It will likely tank.
<StinkomanFan> EVEN THOUGH I TOLD HIM IT WON'T WORK

<Ponies47> Shizuka: Ok. I got a quick chance to get back on my dads computer to close outta the Internet but thatnks for the advice
<Reikim> I'm hoping that maybe if the dub does well then we'll get a sequel
*Mirage spots the piece of paper on Hammer's door and she approaches it to take a look.
<Reikim> Also NOT TRUE SHIZU
<RAWRity> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1iyt96eri1qi3k37o1_1280.jpg
<Reikim> Bebop was best dub, tis true
<AttackPony> fluttercry: Mmm have fun. I'd play Containment Breach, but I'm a scaredy bitch :D
<Reikim> But there are other decent dubs!
<Shizuka> 13eva's was painful >,

<Xaiden> MORE BAND OF BRONIES
<Hammer> "Dear miss Mirage, if you're reading this, I'm probably not around. I went down to the ponyville smith house to take my place as the smithy. I look forward to a visit from you. Thank you for letting me stay the night in your mansion! - Hammer."
<Shizuka> 13all the whine but none of the presence
<Alchemist> and my adobe crashed. again.

<Reikim> Too much whine on Shinji
<Hammer> inb4 she doesn't know where it is)
<AttackPony> Alchemist: It's been doing that lately for some reason.
<Hammer> Oh Hammer, u so silly)
<Reikim> Hey, but Gurren Lagann had a great dub.
<StinkomanFan> 'MERICA
<Reikim> One or two awkward moments, but overall very smooth.
<Spriggals> dun dun dun
<Reikim> FLCL's dub is fantastic.
<SolairePony89> I'm guessing that's it for BoB
<RAWRity> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m101rptYqx1qi3k37o1_500.jpg
<StinkomanFan> How far into the series are we?

<Xaiden> Dovah: What did you think?
<Shizuka> 13you just can't top megumi ogata's blood scream
<Dovah> Xaiden: explain thou inquery!
<Reikim> What's that, Shizu?
*Hammer apparently left nothing behind
<Shizuka> 13shinji's normal VA
<Xaiden> Dovah: It's the fourth of Fucking JULY why not end it tonight?
<Reikim> Ah
<RAWRity> One last pic, FOR AMERICA: http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0qw1vUbR71qi3k37o1_500.jpg
<Reikim> Got to watch the original voices at some time, but then again, there's a lot I need to watch
<Xaiden> RAWRity: Wtf?
<Dovah> Xaiden: "tonight" ends in 1 hr
<Birdy> *Soft looks at Nelaj for a second.*
<Reikim> Absolute most hilarious moment, though, is in Rebuild
<otakon> okay, and the stream just kind of ...stopped
<Dovah> at least for me it does
<Xaiden> Dovah: DAMNIT
<otakon> odd
<Reikim> In the original audio, when Kaji tries to speak English
<RAWRity> otakon: most likely the video has been paused.
<Reikim> It's even more hilarious because the people he's speaking with have native English VAs
<StinkomanFan> WARNING
<AttackPony> Xaiden: 4th of July ends in 2 minutes for the east Coast
<otakon> RAWRity: ah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dat FBI Warning.

*otakon burns his computer to eliminate the trail.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01otakon: NOOO!
<Spriggals> Just a general warning this next part contains lots of death.
*Nelaj looks at Soft again "Um...yes?" he thinks he's in a bad mood which is why he's not quick to greet him like all the rest
<Xaiden> MMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIICAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Xaiden> awww 4 seconds early DAMNIT
<Dovah> ^Fuck Yeah!
<otakon> Spriggals: part 9 of 10? yeah, it's practically the climax, and ep 10 is a the epilogue
<Alchemist> Spriggals: still much much more SFW than Game of Thrones :D
<StinkomanFan> And I'll be unfeeling because I missed the first 8 parts
<AttackPony> It is now officially 5th of July for East Coast.
<StinkomanFan> Because my family are assholes
<otakon> eeyup
<Xaiden> My life sucks
<Xaiden> 4th of july has ended
<StinkomanFan> So if I act like Meanwhile, forgive me
<Liokin> otakon: -lol you just made me think of meet the sniper. "I think his mate saw me.." *bullets shoot up at sniper* "YEP..yep he did..."
<Xaiden> And so will my life
<otakon> God, this realization is just
<Xaiden> XDD
<Reikim> On an unrelated note: having idiots on your server set off too much TNT is bad
<otakon> Liokin: lol
*Mirage frowns some more "Great, I make a friend and he moves out." she kicks a hoof to the floor in disappointment. "I suppose visiting him is still good." she comments to herself, walking out of the second building and makes a trip across town to the smith house. She enters.
<Shizuka> 13oh god the kaji dialogue
<Reikim> Yes that
<Shizuka> 13i cringed so hard..
<Reikim> Absolutely friggin' hilarious
<Shizuka> 13in both versions
<Shizuka> 13it was like GYEEAAAAAAAAARGH
<Reikim> And the best part is that it's completely intentional.
<otakon> and then chat died
<Dovah> lol
<Quick_Thinker> so HOW IM GETTING A AD FROM NO WHERE THIS SITE IS THE ONLY ONE I HAVE OPENED WTF
<Shizuka> 13just butchered so horribly... not even to the level of "i am a foreign language speaker who is trying english"
<AttackPony> otakon: nope.avi
<Reikim> Although you would expect international agent Ryoji Kaji to be a bit more fluent in English, he IS a native Japanese.
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: this site, get Ad Blocker+
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's Mips Quick_Thinker
<SolairePony89> Quick_Thinker: That's happening to you too?
<Quick_Thinker> no not that add
<AttackPony> Quick_Thinker: Do you have AdBlock Plus?
<Quick_Thinker> not the ads in the middle of the stream
<Reikim> I dunno, I find it endearing in a So Bad It's Good way.
<Shizuka> 13throw in the extra vowels that romanization does then but wow..
<StinkomanFan> ...Where's Bronystate getting its funding if we're using addblockers?
<Quick_Thinker> those go away this one WONT ITS EVERYWHERE HA
<SolairePony89> Quick_Thinker: When my sis turned on this laptop this morning ads were playing for some reason. Fucking weird
<Cypresswolf> :D As mush as Id like to continue drinking, I dont get tomorrow off, today was it - going to a bit trashed as it is :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We don't get funding.
<Bronysith> AHAHAHAH
<Birdy> *Soft sighs, "Look kid, sorry I look like shit....but I don't bite."*
<Spriggals> Who does?
<Bronysith> some guy named himself Commander Shepard on youtube
<Alchemist> Quick_Thinker: happened to me too, new tabs opened out of nowhere and there ads for my current isp. then I dl-d adblock and had no problem ever since.
<Xaiden> Nittany_Discord: That sucks
*Hammer waves to her. "Evening, Mirage." He's got a leather apron and a denim cap on.
<Bronysith> and went on a rant on how much he hates bronies
<Reikim> One of the best dubs ever, though
<Reikim> One of THE BEST
<Bronysith> so why does he pose as a brony then?
<Shizuka> 13THE BEST
<Shizuka> 13THE BEST
<Liokin> Bronysith: Surprise surprise..
<SolairePony89> Quick_Thinker: Is it just the audio of the ad?
<Shizuka> 13THE BEST
<Reikim> Is Dragonball Z Abridged
<Quick_Thinker> and no i dont have ad blocker i want this to continue for a long time hanigng out talking with other bronys and shit
<Shizuka> 13WHEN I WAS

<Reikim> That was in fact a joke
<Bronysith> Liokin: isnt male commander VA a brony?
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: dude, just get Ad Blocker
<Alchemist> Bronysith: do we even care?
<SolairePony89> Quick_Thinker: It stopped for me after 5 minutes or so. No idea what caused it
*Nelaj "Oh...okay. Well I'm Nelaj. What's your name?"
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Look its Reznov's Father!
<Bronysith> Alchemist: nope.avi
*Bronysith gives Alchemist an apple
<otakon> Bronysith: he says he likes MLP but not sure if true or just rumor mill
<Bronysith> otakon: ahh
<Shizuka> 13you like the sight of humans on their knees
<Quick_Thinker> it just keeps on talking some shit about BID FOR THIS AND THAT ALL YOU WILL EVER NEED IN LIFE YOU WONT NEED FOOD OR SLEEP OR LOVE
<Xaiden> Bronysith: is that supposed to be funny?
<Liokin> Bronysith: Dont know. And in truth. I dont much care -lol People are dicks. Thats why I hang around ponys.
<Reikim> Well that's a bonus
<StinkomanFan> Remember that time The Doctor saved Hitler's life?
<Reikim> But you were saying?
<Quick_Thinker> so true Liokin
<Bronysith> Xaiden: it is just ironic really
<StinkomanFan> ...Yeah

<Xaiden> Krauts and cleaning
<Xaiden> XD

<cachi01> never played step mania but im sure there must be a folder where all the songs are located Quick_Thinker
<Cypresswolf> Imagine how much stolen nazi things were shipped out by Allied soldiers moving to end it

<RainBowJack> otakon : i know but still i hateed AB for it
<Reikim> Medaka is interesting...
<StinkomanFan> Would you get bent out of shape if we called Sweetie Belle a marshmellow? Or Apple Bloom and Apple?
<Alchemist> Cypresswolf: apparently people got quite rich off of it.
<otakon> but then again, the Nazi's did the same to the French and other countries they conquered
<Reikim> But I still want to see a PaSwG sequel.
<SolairePony89> Cypresswolf: Dat epic loot :P

<Shizuka> 13easily solved, a couple posts in /r/mylittlepony will bring my score back up

*Nelaj sighs "But if you don't want to it's fine."
<Sumica> 00,10this would be around ep 9

<StinkomanFan> I remember something like this from Forrest Gump
<AttackPony> Liokin: I might have to update it...last one was about a month ago....
<Alchemist> Nittany_Discord: I guess for many guys the thought that there is someone waiting for them back at home was a huge motivation. If that was gone they might as well run into a crossfire.
<Liokin> AttackPony: check for an update.

<StinkomanFan> xMLPxREACTORx, tecnically that's true
<adasdad> xMLPxREACTORx: tell him that it IS for little girls, but is still a good enbough show to appeal to all ages and genders.
<otakon> xMLPxREACTORx: don't force him to watch it, just recommend a good "intro" ep to show it's not just a show for little girls. I suggest Lesson Zero.
*Bronysith gives Liokin a pale
<SolairePony89> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Indeed. Then, MW2 came out...
<Shamroc> oh hello Shizuka

<Mirage> "You've never been to either of those places before?"
<Cypresswolf> All of the nazis responsible for the horrors of those places fled when the Allieds got to near
<Sumica> 00,10Cool PJ's
<otakon> And that some people didn't BELIEVE it happened
*Soft nods, "I've heard of it.....pretty neat."
<Ghost30k> Is the next episode playing after this?
<Bronysith> i am so afraid that concentration camps will happen again somehow
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: o_o
<otakon> Ghost30k: the last one, 10
<Bronysith> Sumica: the boy in striped pajamas

*Hammer shakes his head. "Nono, I've never been."
<SaxyPretender> 0,14pretty well
<Reikim> I mean
<Ghost30k> Bronysith: Read that, very sad ending
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I just don't get the chance to do it often
<otakon> Bronysith: they happened in the US to a much lesser degree with the Japanese that lived here.
<Liokin> Sumica: ikr. im totally jelly of that dude that got the gold star on his....
<Sumica> 00,10ZOMBIES!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> this is just scary, and depressing
<Reikim> Yeah, like that
<Sumica> 00,10aim for the head
<Spriggals> ...
<otakon> ;_;
*Nelaj "Yeah. So far I'v only practiced white magic."
<SolairePony89> otakon: Most Germans didn't believe it happened. It is kinda hard to belive in retrospect, but they still needed to find out, which they did
<Bronysith> otakon: i know. but im afraid it might happen the same as the concentration camps for like. idk
<Eliteboy2e7> I AM back
<otakon> wb Eliteboy2e7
<Ghost30k> Eliteboy2e7: Ello

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> SolairePony89: ^
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Being in new york city you'd likely mutate in some way trying to swim in the water there...
<adasdad> Sumica: insensitivity raised to 99! *nord chanting* level up!
<Eliteboy2e7> hello
<Reikim> Ha!
<Ghost30k> He's sucking the soul out of him
<SolairePony89> Ghost30k: Only gingers can do that
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> o_o
<otakon> I couldn't imagine, I really couldn't.
<StinkomanFan> All of my emotions
<Ghost30k> SolairePony89: HA HA
<otakon> StinkomanFan: same here
<RainBowJack> this is the most worst part ( of the WW II)
*Soft thinks, "That's healing and stuff?"
<Bronysith> Sumica: have you read night?
<Cypresswolf> I still cant wrap my mind around how anyone could do that to another person :'(
<Dark92Enigma> ...........How we're gonna rebuild our home..........WITH BAUKER, MAI SON, WITH BAUKER
<Bronysith> WHO HERE read the book Night?
<Sumica> 00,10not that i know of
<Irish_Pony> My dad visited one of the camps...he told me the smell was still there :(
<Reikim> I'm sure NYC has at least some sanitary pools.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14we do
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> poor Anne Frank
<SolairePony89> Bronysith: Heard of it, but I've never got around to reading it
<StinkomanFan> Homosexuals, Gypsies, those who opposed the Nazis
<otakon> Irish_Pony: dear God
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but they're public pools
<Reikim> But they're public, aren't they
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Crazy people.
<Reikim> Yeah
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: and of course jews
<StinkomanFan> And of course... the Jewish
<Eliteboy2e7> Mother of god!!
<Reikim> So sanitary really isn't a thing.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14indeed
<RX-78-SweetieBot> So still mutations
<Cypresswolf> and then to have the town nearby full of people who ignore it all - thats a whole nother level willful ignorance
<RX-78-SweetieBot> just ever worse
<Bronysith> SolairePony89: Sumica it is a good read. but omg the experiences that man went through at 15 is.. o god
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> didnt russians find these camps first?
<otakon> StinkomanFan: the physically infirm, the developmentally challenged. They did that to them.
<Reikim> I think at that point you'd skip the mutations phase and just go straight for death.
<StinkomanFan> They believed it was Labor Camps
<SolairePony89> Cypresswolf: I'm sure those townsfolk were pumped full of propoganda to make them not care
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: they did IIRC.
<StinkomanFan> Not... these things
<adasdad> StinkomanFan: so, ponies, according to the fandom?
*Nelaj nods
<Mirage> "Well Manehattan is a massive place. It's much busier than a place like ponyville. Hundreds of ponies travel along my old street every day, and that's on a slow day. On holidays like hearth's warming, sooo many ponies go shopping... it gets annoying. I can tell Ponyville is going to be a nice change." she blinks and looks out the window "Now Canterlot... well, it looked nice but..." she
<Mirage> pauses, "I was only there for about an hour or so..."
<Quick_Thinker> werent there some camps that fought back and won for awhile
<StinkomanFan> adasdad...What?
<RainBowJack> well every pony i have to go to work bye bye

<Quick_Thinker> um Eliteboy2e7 this is not the time for that
<Eliteboy2e7> k
<Quick_Thinker> at all
<StinkomanFan> adasdad, did you just accuse ponies of being like captured concentration camp victims?
<adasdad> StinkomanFan: poorly timed, response to the homosexuals gypsys and those who opposed the nazis
<Reikim> So is NYC really all that great? I know a lot of people that are rather obsessed with it.
<Mirage> Okay. be back soon >.> )
<Cypresswolf> SolairePony89: The entire Nazi movement was introduced gradually, many followed thinking it could never happened to them, even when thier neighbors started to disapear
<adasdad> StinkomanFan: yes, I think. gotta be a fanfic about it somewhere
<SaxyPretender> 0,14depends
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> anyone remember the Armenian genocide?
<otakon> Cypresswolf: thus the whole argument of "I spoke for no one, so when they came for me there was no one left to speak."
<SaxyPretender> 0,14if you don't mind the hustle and bustle
<StinkomanFan> adasdad... that's just... no words
<SaxyPretender> 0,14then you'll probably like it
<SolairePony89> Cypresswolf: Well yeah, but I mean the townsfolk near the camp must of been pumped with an extreme amount of propoganda
<otakon> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: I'm afraid not.
<Bronysith> world war 2 is my fav moment in history. everything was so interesting. disturbing as hell
<StinkomanFan> I prefered the Gang Eras
<otakon> God, these conditions aren't even fit for animals
<Ghost30k> shit....
<StinkomanFan> They weren't as depressing
<Bronysith> otakon: you dont say
<Vordox> gas chambers
<AttackPony> Oh god...
<StinkomanFan> acid showers
<Bronysith> this is like
<Cypresswolf> SolairePony89: in this case - German Pride, they were probably brainwashed right from the start
<SolairePony89> otakon: Because they weren't build for animals
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Railroad cars of people.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14definately worth a visit, few places are like it
<Quick_Thinker> and even you were unlucky scientfic experiments
<Liokin> AttackPony: yup...
<Bronysith> how could people treat others like this for their beliefs?
<Bronysith> sick world
<SolairePony89> Is there anyone out there who hasn't seen Schindler's List?
<otakon> Bronysith: I don't know, I just don't know.
<StinkomanFan> Bronysith, brainwashing
<Bronysith> mass media
<Reikim> I'll see what I can do.
<SolairePony89> A whole lot of brainwashing
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> sometimes you wonder if you ask a german politician if WW2 happened and he would probably say no
<Vordox> Bronysith: Religion, belief, a higher existance, hierarchy. Alot of things.
<Dovah> people will do anything and everything for their beliefs.
<otakon> SolairePony89: I haven't seen the whole movie, only some bits. really want to see the whole thing
*Irish_Pony is planning to visit one of these camps to pay his respects
<AttackPony> SolairePony89: I've seen it, but never read the book.
<Bronysith> Vordox: yep
<Eliteboy2k7> I got disconnected
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sad fact: It could still happen.
<otakon> wb Eliteboy2e7
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Sad fact...it's still happening
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: im scared that it might
<Eliteboy2k7> so i had to change my name
<Ghost30k> all because of one man, hitler, decided to blame the Jews, all these people died, I don't often believe people deserve to go to hell but hitler, Fuck, If i had the choice I escort him myself to his eternal torture
<Quick_Thinker> for instance austic people would be one of the first to go if i base this off the entire sick idea
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Vordox: I know.
<SolairePony89> otakon: You need to. The ending of the movie is probably the most moving part of any movie I've ever seen
<Liokin> Suddenly O'keith just doesnt want to be here anymore. Thats war kid. Its cruel. Its Ugly. Its goddamn shame.
<Vordox> Ghost30k: Hitler didn't start it
<Eliteboy2k7> who has steam
<Derpy_Hooves> its midnight here
<Derpy_Hooves> im going to bed
<Cypresswolf> Tell a lie long enough...people start to believe it
<otakon> SolairePony89: I do, but I haven't been able to find a copy anywhere.
<Ghost30k> Vordox: Well than who did?
<AttackPony> Night, Derpy_Hooves
<Liokin> Eliteboy2k7: just about everypony here.
<Spriggals> Mmmmmm bread.
<otakon> TELL THAT BAKER TO SHUT THE BUCK UP!
<Liokin> Derpy_Hooves: Later bro /)
<StinkomanFan> Hitler may not have started it, but he sure as hell didn't stop it
<Shamroc> wew i just got pony swag! yay
<Vordox> Ghost30k: I do not know, but I am certain Hitler is not the one who started that belief.
<Reikim> What kind of swag?
<Shamroc> shitt
<Shamroc> shirt*
<SolairePony89> otakon: I saw it in school. Probably would of cried if I wasn't in a schoolroom
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> so ya bascially most german ppl didnt know about the concentration camps
<otakon> or they turned a blind eye
<Liokin> I would drag him to the camp and make him look at it.
<Reikim> What kind of shirt?
<Sumica> 00,10put the fear of god in to em
<otakon> bc they didn't want to be next
<Ghost30k> It was, I read it in History class, he blamed them for all of the problems left by WW1
<AttackPony> EVERYONE needs to see Schindler's List.
<otakon> AttackPony: we should stream it here
<StinkomanFan> I wanna see that
<otakon> but dammit I didn't put it as my A
<AttackPony> otakon: Would we be allowed to?
<otakon> I should have
<Quick_Thinker> i think one of the camps was the camp shown in the great escape
<Liokin> Sumica: and this sir is why bakers are awesome. Feed the world your bread sumi.
<SolairePony89> Liokin: Much of the German populace was shown at least videos of concentration camps
<Quick_Thinker> WOAH
<StinkomanFan> D:

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> :(
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Is Schindler's List as bad as Requiem?
<Cypresswolf> thats a harsh decision
<AttackPony> otakon: I've never seen Requiem for a Dream but I think it's tame compared to Schindler's List
<Reikim> What kind of doctor?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: i dont think so
<StinkomanFan> Requiem for a Dream was TERRIFYING
<Bronysith> Sumica: ooh ya you bake. i love baked goods! what is your fav to make?

<Cypresswolf> Quick_Thinker: I have
<SaxyPretender> 0,14heh, you really like that Asuka cosplay pic
<Shizuka> 13well that was anticlimactic..
<StinkomanFan> Dovah, a film about the Concentration Camp

<Reikim> Ah, thanks.
<SolairePony89> otakon: Thanks God for that
<Dumorimasoddaa> Yup
<Quick_Thinker> this series handles it very well im disapointed in my self that i have seen this
<Sumica> 00,10Sneek a peice?
<SolairePony89> Thank*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Stalin did his own killing.
<Dumorimasoddaa> I still lurk there but it's dead
<Sumica> 00,10what like eat what I make.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Stalin i think killed more than Hitler
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Possibly more than Hitler.
<Dumorimasoddaa> I looked in I'm op'd
<Liokin> Sumica: she means get it on in the back room.
<Riders> It's been a worthwhile experience bronies but I've gotta go; starting to pass in and out of conciousness so Bed time for me. Happy 4th
<otakon> I've been in a chicken house in 100 degree heat surrounded by 10K dead chickens...that has NOTHING on that scene.
<Dumorimasoddaa> ...
<otakon> bye Riders sleep well
<AttackPony> Sumica: Yep
<Reikim> Probably because the channel died and you recreated it.
<Liokin> Sumica: Of course she means what you bake! >:3 -lol

<Cypresswolf> Goodnight Riders
<SolairePony89> Stalin killed more than Hitler, yes. He killed an estimated 20 million, here Hitler killed 13 million
<Dumorimasoddaa> I'm hardly off line but it was reg'd
<Sumica> 00,10all the time, it's called quality control =p

<Ghost30k> *The prisoners
<Vordox> What SolairePony89 ?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Awkward?
<Dumorimasoddaa> So yeah those 30days ticks
<AttackPony> Sumica: Strong control you have there.
<Vordox> SolairePony89: I thought that was the total casuality of germans/Russians
<otakon> Ghost30k: bc they didn't want to believe, bc they didn't think it actually happened. And they're regretting turning a blind eye to it.
<Reikim> Again, it probably died.
<Spriggals> Im going to say this...there are no evil and good in war, only winners and loosers.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01controls Sumica

<StinkomanFan> THANK GOD
<StinkomanFan> HITLER'S DEAD
<Quick_Thinker> no where near is the war over
<Ghost30k> This wasn't really an actiony episode
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> wow buffer
<otakon> SuperBrony64: hiya guy, you happily missed the saddest bit.
<MahBoi777> hey SB!
<Bronysith> HItler is being tortured relentlessly in hell. HE DESERVES WORSE
<SolairePony89> Vordox: Nope. Russians had 20 million losses in total I think though
<otakon> Ghost30k: it's winding down is all.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02otakon: Good :3
<Vordox> SolairePony89: Yeah, and German had 13
<Shamroc> moop
<Ghost30k> I know,
<SolairePony89> We should stream Downfall someday. It'd be quite interesting methinks
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I don't liek sad stuff :<
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: WATCH THIIIIS
<Quick_Thinker> OKAY WAHT IS WITH THE VILONS
<Dumorimasoddaa> I know I'm no IRC fool
<StinkomanFan> Bronysith, a movie once showed Hitler get pineapple shoved up his ass
<Vordox> Quick_Thinker: Emotion outlet
<Alchemist> Ghost30k: at this point I think the Russian front was advancing much more than the US.
<Liokin> Would you guys get outa here! The atmosphere is enough! >:3
<Dumorimasoddaa> I was just relaying it's death
<otakon> Quick_Thinker: popular instrument back then.
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: still not bad enough
<AttackPony> There's a special spot in Hell JUST reserved for Hitler.
<Quick_Thinker> fair enough but its tugging at my heart now
<Liokin> Damn troll musiscians..
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Stalin killed 90% of the russian generals which kinda helped making 29 million death
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: he needs the worst possible thing to happen to him ever
<otakon> the 'Final Solution'
<SolairePony89> Vordox: That's the total amout that died in the Concentration Camps, not German losses throughout the war
*Reikim plays a requiem for lobby
<StinkomanFan> Another had Hitler be zombified and then killed in one of his Acid showers
<otakon> dear God, HOW? HOW COULD ANYONE BE THAT GODDAMN HEARTLES?! HOW!?
<SolairePony89> otakon: Insanity mixed with power
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: still not bad enough
<Quick_Thinker> corruption in the hearts of men
<StinkomanFan> otakon, the history of man is filled with monsters
<Spriggals> Last part.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yep.
<StinkomanFan> Those who are heros to some are evil to others
<Bronysith> StinkomanFan: im thinking you jam a glass marble in his wingahonga, half way throgh the pipe and smash it with a hammer.
<SolairePony89> Given the chance, I'm sure many more people would do what Hitler did
<Irish_Pony> otakon: the world is heartless if you think about it, there will never be any mercy, there can only be punishment
<Reikim> ...Kind of a depressing way to end the night, but good night, everyone. I'll see you all at the BMN on Friday.
<AttackPony> I read an article on Yahoo! about the significant of violins and those that were in the concentration campts.
<Vordox> 65.6 million people died in WW2
<Vordox> Total
<Cypresswolf> otakon: History is full of such monsterous individuals - Hitler was far from the first, nor was he the last
<Dumorimasoddaa> #lobby was this room back when Shizuka was hatless
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Vordox: wasnt it more than that?
<StinkomanFan> Napoleaon was either a hero or a monster
<Dumorimasoddaa> End the night I just woke up
<Ghost30k> Stalin was worse,he killed over 25 MILLLION PEOPLE AT SIBERIAN GULAGS, the only reason it hasn't been really talked about in history is because the last thing we all need as americans is Russia at our throats
<Vordox> USSR: 20.0MChina: 10.45MPoland: 5.8MGermany: 5.5MIndia: 2.15MJapan: 1.9MYugoslavia: 1.55M

<Quick_Thinker> now the question stands WHAT HAPPENS IF WE NEVER FOUND GUNPOWDER
<otakon1> USB borked on me
<Bronysith> Cypresswolf: to think in a few years there is probably going to be some sort of new mad evil psychopath

<otakon1> SolairePony89: USB borked, otakon is dead but chat don't know it and I don't feel like ghosting it.
<Vordox> ALL DEATH TOLLS
<Vordox> Total and Military losses
<SolairePony89> otakon1: M'kay
<Alchemist> otakon1: exactly :) We'd have state of the art steam powered arrow machine guns.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And then we made the bomb bigger.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And bigger.
<Cypresswolf> There are a few such...so called "leaders" commiting similar acts to their own citizens and others today - Assad in Syria is being talked about quite alot lately
<SolairePony89> Arms race in a nutshell Nittany_Discord
<StinkomanFan> And then we dropped it on Japan
<Spriggals> and then it shrunk.
<Bronysith> this shit all started when two people ate an apple
<Vordox> 16.9 Civilians died in Russian
<Quick_Thinker> and now we dont use it at all we just threaten to
<StinkomanFan> And then we made it even more powerful
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And pointed the bombs and missiles at each other so the other side wouldn't use their bombs.
<Dumorimasoddaa> It feels like 50% if not more of the old lobby crowd no longer exist
*Hammer stares at Mirage, wide eyed. "...Hundreds of ponies?" He blinks and leans back. He shakes his head. "I've only met about a couple hundred in my life." He gives a short chuckle.
<Vordox> 1.6 was germans.
<Dumorimasoddaa> And a chunk of the ones who do are mods
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> makes you wonder what would happen if Russia was still communist
<Liokin> One thing rings true to me no matter how many times I run it through my head. "At the end of the day, So long as there are two people left on the planet. Somebody is gonna want somebody dead"
<Quick_Thinker> so okay what if we never discover atomic fussion?
<StinkomanFan> Sometimes I fear that the Cold War never really ended...
<Shamroc> well then thats why im here...to be the new set of old crowd.....
<Alchemist> Nittany_Discord: and now all it takes is a delusional mind and an itchy finger.
<Bronysith> Liokin: the sniper is philosophical
<Liokin> Bronysith: correct. ^-^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Canada is probably going to be left alone for a long long long time
<StinkomanFan> Liokin, in hindsight, that line is insanely sad
<Bronysith> Liokin: and hes married to glados. double win
<Dumorimasoddaa> But you wheren't here at the start
<Liokin> StinkomanFan: But true.
<Shamroc> well of course i wasntr
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Alchemist: Yep.
<Quick_Thinker> okay guys im doing the MLP FIM theme on HARD for Step mania wish me luck
<Dumorimasoddaa> Not where all of us but most where from BMN 1-5
<SolairePony89> Quick_Thinker: Good luck, mate
<Mirage> "Yeah you'd be suprised from the sounds of it. Canterlot had almost as many ponies as manehattan does!"
<StinkomanFan> Kindness is not a natural emotion. It's better
<Cypresswolf> almost midnight - got 1 more thing I need to do before bed - brb
<Dumorimasoddaa> Back when BMNs where sometimes as busy as chat is now
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> so do we have a bronystate tf2 server yet?
<StinkomanFan> I wanted to make a Bronystate Minecraft server
<superretroworld> night everypony
<StinkomanFan> but that didn't work
<Liokin> guns for photographs seems legit.
<AttackPony> Night, superretroworld
<Liokin> superretroworld: Later bro /)
*Hammer leans forward, brow raised. "How many of these ponies did you actually know?"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why did it not work?
<Yahooz> woah
<Yahooz> Dumorimasoddaa is active?
<Yahooz> stop the presses
<superretroworld> Liokin: (\
<Dumorimasoddaa> I lurk
*Bronysith passes out fatman nukes
<Dumorimasoddaa> I always lurked
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01(\ Liokin
<Yahooz> i mean chatting wise
<Yahooz> i know you lurk
<Quick_Thinker> and i failed
<Yahooz> idlerpg does that
<Dumorimasoddaa> Hehe
<Dumorimasoddaa> Nah
*Liokin dusts Nittany_Discord "Im not leaving >:3"
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh.
<Dumorimasoddaa> IdleRPG is makes me lurk a tiny but more
*Bronysith noms on Nittany_Discord
<Cypresswolf> a shot of my finest whiskey to all those serving today, and those who are in the stream right now - Cheers!
<Mirage> "Oh, only a fraction of the ponies in the city!" she laughs "It's not like a small town or village where you know almost everpony, I sometimes wish it were that way though."
<Bronysith> Cypresswolf cheers
<AttackPony> Cypresswolf: Can't drink. Underage.
<StinkomanFan> I remember this terrifying cartoon that showed the last two people killing each other dead
<Bronysith> ogod why lol http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5438/
<RX-78-SweetieBot> and then IdleRPG had DLC....
<otakon1> funny, but wrong
<StinkomanFan> Then it showed cheery animals using human corpses as houses
<Shamroc> wut
*Soft just continues drinking, "Y'aight kid?"
<StinkomanFan> And war gear
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> I do not know what WW3 will be fought with, but all i know is that WW4 will be fought with stick and stones, that quote is so memorable
<Dumorimasoddaa> IdleRPG is like a f2p game
<Dumorimasoddaa> With no pay to win
<Bronysith> i must go to bed but i am going to http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2042/
<Shamroc> Dumorimasoddaa...i know what it is..
<StinkomanFan> The worst part? It was WW1 gear
<RX-78-SweetieBot> I know
<RX-78-SweetieBot> thats the joke

<Sumica> 00,10lol, realy?
<otakon1> StinkomanFan: Warner Bros. cartoon, on CHRISTMAS
<Reiko> <7.05.12: The fourth of july for the ponies here and I'm glad I wasn't invited to anything. All I heard that the beaches were full and the cookout here was done before i entered here, so I'm not worried as long as I stay well hidden. The next thing I will do is destroy every celestia damned camera here!>
<Bronysith> i am going to post ponies instead otakon1 silly filly
<Cypresswolf> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: hmm...Mark Twain, I believe
<StinkomanFan> otakon1, Peace on Earth if I remember
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Cypresswolf: nope its Albert Einstein
<Shamroc> WOO I WE WIN!
<Liokin> StinkomanFan: Well I have a minecraft server up but I only use it really for me and somepony else. We just do 2 man survival and see how long we can go really. we've built huge towns just us two but it eventually got old I guess. If you want to we could use that server. but Id have to get in contact with him again but if I do i'll be able to get the server up and a bunch of BrS can head there.
<Quick_Thinker> YEAH FUCK SLEEP WE DONT NEED IT (okay why were the functions of sleep built seriously i know it heals and rests your body but its seems like such a waste of Luna)
<Cypresswolf> A man truly wiser than his years
<otakon1> StinkomanFan: eeyup, they read from the bible too. it was actually a deep cartoon even for today's standards and ahead of it's time for back then
<Spriggals> Nice, clean, austrian streets.
<Dumorimasoddaa> No the joke is if you added pay2win
<Dumorimasoddaa> People would pay
<AttackPony> brb guys, updating flash player
<StinkomanFan> otakon1, it's on TVTropes's nightmare fuel page for animation
<Ghost30k> This was me when i saw the AC3 trailer http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/883/
*Nelaj "Yeah. Sorry. It's just you sorta gave off a bad vibe when you came in. No offence."
<StinkomanFan> Right near Plague Dogs...
*Hammer smiles and nods. "I know how that is." He clears his throat, picking up a curved pick. He puts it into the hearth and pulls out a bright red shoe, carrying it to a larger anvil in the room and setting it down. He smiles at Mirage as he picks up a hammer in hoof and proceeds to hammer away. "I knew everyone back home. I knew ponies from before i was born."
<Shamroc> no i ment.. i now what idlerpg is
<Shamroc> i understand the concept of f2p and p2w...
<RX-78-SweetieBot> http://derpy.me/W8IDG
<StinkomanFan> Fucking Plague Dogs. You thought Watership Dow was depressing?
<StinkomanFan> Made by the same guys
<Bronysith> Ghost30k: you got that over a yearly game?
<Ghost30k> Yup
<StinkomanFan> >Kill Hitler, take his stuff
<Cypresswolf> Plague Dogs was one of the few movies that brought me to tears
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> eww a portrait of Hitler
