<AJIsAwesome> linsett: Poison Suction. :D
<J_E_Smith71> Shizuka: Then there's dubs that spoof the original or go in a whole another direction like Shin-Chan

<AJIsAwesome> Nitric Oxide is NO (I think) and I'm not sure about sodium hypobromide.
<Sumica> 00,10ffs level
<owloysius> i mean sodium hypobromite..
*Spectrum_Rush Und dann no one guesses what I just did...
<oni_link> This game is such a troll but thats what is drawing me to it ...
<Phase4> Wrek, should i research astrophysics and get another planet or save up for the 4th level of hyperspace drive?
<Sumica> 00,10this is like battle toads level of fuck you level

<Phase4> NewSuperBronyU, yeah, timing is a little tight
<owloysius> Polydunami: fine, i'll do it myself.
<Mutterguy> NewSuperBronyU it's because you aren't 13 anymore
<Canadian_Brony> oni_link I loathe MLG players. They think they're cool and then rage when they play anything besides CoD or Halo.
<Phase4> NewSuperBronyU, i think you need to bounce of that things head and hover
<Canadian_Brony> Scoots wreaks of MLG
<Phase4> or not
<Phase4> ignore me
<Sumica> 00,10cant ledge grab at all
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Phase4: That's what you need to do :)
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 I'm not ignoring you.
<thelonepony> You can do it SB !!!!!!
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: DOesn't he say MLG to make fun of MLGs?
<oni_link> Canadian_Brony: Ohhhh, yeah. LOL. but oh well to each his own. I just play for fun
<Phase4> oh wow, i see
<Phase4> i ment the earlier one but thats cool
<Cypresswolf> meh...not getting to sleep anytime soon - another insomnia spell :S
<Sumica> 00,10you ledge grab you loose
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: I know that feeling. :(
<Phase4> imperfect performance? YOU LOOSE
<oni_link> ^
<Phase4> theres no chance for recovery here, have to perfect it
<Lil_B> Cypresswolf /me casts insomnius maximus on Cypresswolf
<Kinixys> At least it's unlimited lives.
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome I would ask him myself if that's the truth, but being Scoots, I can already tell he'll deny even the thought.
<oni_link> Very Super Meat Boy esque
<thelonepony> Cypresswolf: same here :(
<Sumica> 00,10was thinking the same thing oni_link
<AJIsAwesome> Well this IS the hardest level in the game.
<Cypresswolf> usually happens when Im under great stress
<Kinixys> Some games it's play through another 70 levels if you loose all yoru lives.
<Phase4> made it
<oni_link> Or if anyone remembered, I wanna be the guy.
<Lil_B> oni_link and this isn't even his this Level's final Form, yet!
<Mutterguy> bravo goodsir
<oni_link> Lil_B: oh gawd
<Phase4> spikey hat
<Lil_B> oni_link I never got past level one of IWBTG :/
<Sullivan> Your perfection must reach perfect levelsof perfection to compleete this level.
<Sumica> 00,10IWTBTG had levels?
<oni_link> Lil_B: Its sitting in a folder in my desktop, collecting dust XD
*Tovler tries to remember if DKCR was this hard
<oni_link> Sumica: eeyup also theres a beta for the sequel
<Lil_B> CComplete this to make asian Dad proud
<Sullivan> I always hated platform jumper games
<AJIsAwesome> Avoid th woman.
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: IWBTG had more then one screen? :S
<Sumica> 00,10hey Phase4, use your leet hacking skills and figure out how to get video out on the PS vita
<AJIsAwesome> SHe'll ALWAYS hit you.
<Lil_B> I know DKC 2 hadf rather insane parts in the later levels
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02This must be the final you take at Medical School.
<oni_link> IWTBTG: Gaiden I think
<Cypresswolf> at this rate, Ill the meet up plans at the Ren Fest for tomorrow - I can still go sunday, but Ill miss out on the burning pony tomorrow night
<thelonepony> well night everypony and thanks for the stream NewSuperBronyU :)

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Night owloysius :)
<thelonepony> night owloysius
<thelonepony> :)
<oni_link> Just because I've been hearing this song long enough, I must make a looped version. When I learn the name that is.
<Phase4> Sumica, seems sony is very actively fighting hackers on the ps vita
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Okay. I was very close to getting to go, but my father has a business trip to attend in Denmark.
<Phase4> Sumica, unless theres a builtin app to play video your probably stuffed
<Phase4> Sumica, oh wait, video OUT, i'ma derp
<Cypresswolf> AJIsAwesome: There's Oni Con next weekend in Galveston
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Nice! I'll see what I can do. Thanks. :)
<Sumica> 00,10and yeah they are fighting it and failing Phase4
<oni_link> Sumica: Isn't there an option for that by connecting to a PS3?
<Sumica> 00,10a developer released an ISO reader app
<Sumica> 00,10that dose me no good oni_link
<Lil_B> Sony always fights really hard so people don't use their Stuff in ways they didn't intend to, even if it was legal what they were doing :/
<oni_link> Sumica: Yeah, I'm just trying to remember. I think there was a video out cable one could buy. Unless I'm thinking of the PSP now
*Sumica pictures SB raging and storming around his rom
<Phase4> Sumica, looks like theres no internal video out, probably he cpu
<Phase4> dero
<Phase4> derp'
<oni_link> Lil_B: Like Linux in a PS3?
<Mutterguy> and i couldn't fault him for it
<Phase4> Sumica, the screen is probably connected directly to the cpu, no encoders
<Lil_B> oni_link yeah , that's the best example
<oni_link> Oh wow troll fire
<Lil_B> SB64 just went MLG Pro there xD
<Canadian_Brony> bu bumbum bum bumbum bumbum
<Lil_B> These Flames look so good... gotta love this Style >.<
<scout19_tf2> this game reminds me of mega run
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: Veer to the far left instead of hugging the wall.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah there is mods for the psp Phase4 that lest you use the USB port as a video out
<AJIsAwesome> That way you can get poast without getting crushed.
<Phase4> Sumica, use the what now?
<AJIsAwesome> *past
<Tovler> psh. Rayman Legends had better be harder than this
<Lil_B> btw, the whole western Style music of this level is in one SDong in the Soundtrack called "Rayman Origins Music: Land of the Livid Dead ~ Nowhere to Run" I reccoment checking it out later if you like it : )
<Sumica> 00,10on the PSP the micro usb port can be used as a signal out
<Mutterguy> Lil_B thanks
<Sumica> 00,10the data port is the only port besides the.5mm jack for sound
<Lil_B> no prop Mutterguy
<taoumi> yep totaly rage quit out of killing floor there
<sub06905> well i believe im a bit OP in paper mario currently
<Lil_B> well... the floor is pretty much Lava ... and the wallss and the ceiling
<oni_link> Land of the Livid Dead ~ Chasing a Dream is my favorite song so far :3 in Origins
<Lil_B> sub06905 the first one?
<Sumica> 00,10it has like 5 card ports but just the data port for actal in and out signals
<sub06905> Lil_B: TTYD
<Wrek> 05sumi
<Lil_B> sub06905 ah
<Wrek> 05whens the servers gona be back up?
<Sumica> 00,10It even has a damn Sim card
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: How so?
<Sumica> 00,10not sure wrek
<Sumica> 00,10what time did it say?
<oni_link> Sumica it had a Sim slot??
<Canadian_Brony> and we hear real music aaaaaannnd it's gone
<Wrek> 05it didnt
<Sumica> 00,10yeah oni_link I can use it as a phone
<oni_link> Wow.
<oni_link> Yay I love this music
<sub06905> AJIsAwesome: well you know the boss Macho Grubba? i managed to beat him in 4 turns....
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: :D
<Lil_B> I think it's strange that the memory Card Slot is litterely just a SD Card Slot, just with swapped Pins, so they can charge you extremnly high prices for it :/
<sub06905> AJIsAwesome: also managed to deafeat Rawk Hawk in 2 turns :D
<Sumica> 00,10it's usealy 5 hours wrek
<oni_link> Rayman, meet bullet hell via fireballs
<Phase4> Sumica, theres an unknown fujitsu chip oposit the screen connector, it MIGHT handle video and if so its not imposible theres video out on the usb port, but i'd need access to an open ps vita to check
<Polydunami> ?
<Canadian_Brony> WTF is that thing?
<AJIsAwesome> Ladies and Gentlemen: The SUPERBOSS of this game.
<Sylandest> what in the name of god
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Big Mamma
<Canadian_Brony> Kill it! Kill it with . . .
<Sylandest> she's...very big
<Canadian_Brony> Just kill it!

<Canadian_Brony> g'night mer-
<Canadian_Brony> dah
<TheRandomkid321> oni_link so you mean it once actually had zombies in it?
<Spectrum_Rush> so there
*NewSuperBronyU licks AdamTheDuck back :3
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, define "tradtional"
<AdamTheDuck> traditional*
<MadSurge> SUPER MEAT BOY :O
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Dat Dramatic Prairie Dog theme
<Spectrum_Rush> now you can be a big stupid doodoohead sub06905
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck like Dawn of The dead and stuff
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, nah, it's the infection type apocalypes.
<oni_link> TheRandomkid321: RE Zero, 1, 2 and if I remember 3 as well.
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck well I mean like 28 days later
<oni_link> I dont care what anyone says, the Gamecube remake of RE1 is the scariest game in the Resident Evil library
<Lil_B> NewSuperBronyU I hate that they cancelled Super Meat Boy for the Wii, because the Game was too big, the maximum for WiiWare Titles are 40MB aand the lowest they could get was 42MB and Nintendo said NO
<oni_link> Lil_B: wow
<oni_link> 2MB >.>
*Tovler remembers the bathtub scene from Eternal Darkness
*oni_link has not played Eternal Darkness
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The new limit on the 3DS is 2 GB
<oni_link> Whoa
<TheRandomkid321> oni_link so it didn't have all those tentacle ridden things and whatnot?
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, the first movie was escaping the facility (no apocalypes yet), the 2nd movie was about what happened after the outbreak and how the city coped
<Canadian_Brony> for memory?
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck I mean the games
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321, heh, not sure then. :P ponyshrug.jpg
<TheRandomkid321> NewSuperBronyU SO are you done streaming?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02TheRandomkid321: No o.o
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm streaming right now
<TheRandomkid321> o_o
<oni_link> TheRandomkid321: I can safely say that there were zombified dobermans, actual zombies,(not gun toting parasites) a chemically altered tree or giant plant and the hunters and eventually Tyrant.
<TheRandomkid321> Oh I got it now
<Sumica> 00,10How odd, the lower bar on my firefox where noscript and AB+ is no longer showing up
<Lil_B> Emmie finally found the Binary Tool, now I would only need a Binary Ereaser xD
<Sumica> 00,10ah I see, some how disabled my addon bar
<sub06905> make the change to IE today >.>
<TheRandomkid321> After seeing soem of the games PETA has made I can safely say they are all fucked up phsycopaths.
<oni_link> Well everyone, I think Im off for the night. Thanks for the tips Sumica and thanks for the stream NewSuperBronyU :)
<Spectrum_Rush> ya don't say
<sub06905> bai oni_link
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Night oni_link :)
<Spectrum_Rush> nite oni_link
<Canadian_Brony> g'night oni_link
<Lil_B> good night oni_link :)
<Sumica> 00,10hey cool they have an offical wiki for planet side 2 now
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight oni_link
<Tovler> If I still did dress-up, I'd go as PETA-Ash
<TheRandomkid321> I have not yet played their pokemon agme. BRB
<Lil_B> IE9 is actually not bad, it may not fully hold up to the others, but it can do everything, is quite Tweakable and can be vbery secure if you care to take a Look into the options
<Lil_B> but I'll stay with Maxthon 3 xD
<Tovler> whining about SM3DL's Tanooki Suit 20+ years after it was first introduced. Now whining about Pokemon 15 year after the fact
<Ryunosuke> ...
<Lil_B> I wonder how many people at PETA actually played some of these games, because I dodn't think it's a small percentage
<Tovler> Its funny because BW raises the exact same issues PETA has in its story
<Ryunosuke> i'll just say this, Peta is still relevant?
<Lil_B> I didn't even knew they existed xD
<Sylandest> wat
<MadSurge> Tovler: more like Animal WRONGS Group amirite?
<Tovler> PETA still does the sex-sells thing even though that gimmick died 10 years ago
<Lil_B> I hate my controller, I found out I can't beat the second last stage because thge delay of me pressing the button and the game registering is just too big >.>
<Tovler> at least the music doesn't reset when you die
<Tovler> itd be cooler if his body skidded down the spikes instead of exploding.
<Lil_B> There actually is a Psoido-3D Super Meat Boy Game
<Spectrum_Rush> pseudo
<Lil_B> thanks i didn't knew howe to spell it :/
<Lil_B> In the Arcade in Retro City Rampage is a Bit.Trip Runner and a Super Meat Boy Game both again with remixes of their original music
<DaringDerpy> hey

<DaringDerpy> PETA?
<Canadian_Brony> and you said this was easy, eh?
<Lil_B> so I was just browsing Memebase when I found this nice PETA releated Picture :/
<DaringDerpy> sounds like it's loaded with political propaganda and not much else
<Tovler> Peeta from Hunger Games
<Lil_B> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/11/NUfEs-Z-CkawvQk4QGfCdQ2.jpg

<Lil_B> DaringDerpy good... nopw Shush or I'll have to SDtuff Pilows into my Ear : (

*Dovah says hi for the first time even tho he's been here for 11 hours

<Polydunami> I may come across as a prick at times
<N4X> Really?
<N4X> TheRandomkid321 : Maybe we were online but to different times
<N4X> I'm not sure
<TheRandomkid321> Am I the only one who gets aggrivated by flutterchus randomness? ironic isn't it?
<AdamTheDuck> No you're not alone TheRandomkid321 :P
<N4X> But I believe I saw you atleast once in the chat,but again: I only believe
<Polydunami> Flutterwho?
<Polydunami> :3
<AdamTheDuck> But aggrovated is a bit of a strong word
<TheRandomkid321> N4X Now that you mention it I may have seen you once.
<AdamTheDuck> I'm more midly annoyed at the random pictures he/she keeps linking
<Polydunami> It's a possibility
<AdamTheDuck> But sometimes they're not random.
<Jmo> Want a tissue diddums?
*Jmo slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
*AdamTheDuck licks Jmo :P

<Polydunami> *any
<N4X> Lil_B : Is Flutterchu another user or what?

<Canadian_Brony> O_____O
<AdamTheDuck> Obligatory "dat intro"
<Canadian_Brony> yeah
<Canadian_Brony> and suddenly full-on choir
<Canadian_Brony> oohhh, that Rainbow Factory violin sends chills down my spine
<Wirisme> are these samples? because it sounds amazing
<AdamTheDuck> "This is a symphonic cover of multiple songs by WoodenToaster, also known as Glaze."
<Canadian_Brony> Glaze/WoodenToaster makes amazing music
<Canadian_Brony> Rainbow Factory, Beyond her Garden, Pinkie's Lie, Awoken, Nightmare Night to name a few
<Canadian_Brony> and those are only his brony songs
<Moopy> Hey listen awoken its pretty badass song
<Canadian_Brony> I got the underlying meaning first time I heard it
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: no zzz
<Canadian_Brony> TBH, I was biased towards the brony community at first, but I never said it to anyone.
<Lil_B> I hate listening to songs artists like this, gets me as a new guy in mmusic all envyus xD
<Canadian_Brony> anyways, back to Minecraft
<Wirisme> 11 years as a musician and I'm kinda envious
<Canadian_Brony> I sing and that's it
<Lil_B> Wirisme when did you start to compose?
<Wirisme> I can't remember, I think around 14ish, but I don't really do it anymore
<Wirisme> I really should get back into it
<Lil_B> I think I started about a year ago now, my music isn't that good but I try my best
<Lil_B> Wirisme do it, it's fun to share it with people :)
<Wirisme> :) you're probably better than me actually
<Lil_B> probably not, do you want a sample?
<Wirisme> I'd love to hear :)
<Lil_B> ok :) I'll PM
<Wirisme> I have a huge problem of making everything more complicated than it needs to be, so it just ends up a big mess in the end :p
<Canadian_Brony> I sang in a school choir for 4 years, but I was dissapointed to find my high school didn't have one as well. I haven't sang in public for almost 3 years
<Wirisme> I'm definitely not a singer ;p
<Wirisme> :p*
<Canadian_Brony> my voice isn't what it used to be, but I can still hold a tune. Heck, I agreed to sing at my local hospital next week during my volunteer shift.
<Canadian_Brony> "Come Little Children"
<Canadian_Brony> hoping to get musical accompiament, otherwise it will be extremely difficult
<Canadian_Brony> as if it isn't hard enough, me being male and the lead singer being a female in song
<Herostar> -runs down hall, four zombiedogs chasing him- Penumbra, why did I invest in this mess!!!
<Lil_B> Canadian_Brony Hope it goes well, would love to hear you sing :) maybe get a mic to record it
<Canadian_Brony> all I have is a 3DS, which doesn't take very good audio or video, and a webcam, which isn't the best either
<Herostar> -gallops down the hall again, 12 dogs on his hind this time- I DIDN'T DO IT! that was not my jerky! I did not smack you with it TAT
*Herostar has become dog food
<Canadian_Brony> STREam

<Colt_Brovakiin> Welcome back flyingace11 :3
<MadSurge> flyingace11: welcome again!
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, you know, you asked me who my favourite pony was but I never got the chance for your opionion. :P
<flutterbutt> therainbowvortex: someone wrote up on a whiteboard the youtube address of an episode
<flutterbutt> and i was hooked
<therainbowvortex> flutterbutt: awsome
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai flyingace11
<flutterbutt> i spent 3 nights blitzing through bother seasons
<flyingace11> Colt_Brovakiin MadSurge AdamTheDuck Thanks!
<flutterbutt> *both
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: Pinkie! But Fluttershy comes to a real close :)
<flutterbutt> fluttershy is best pony
<AdamTheDuck> Pfffft
<Kammerjunk> I'm partial to Twiley.
<AdamTheDuck> Spike is best pony
<Colt_Brovakiin> I am the best pony :3
<alexxm> so whens season 3 out
<flyingace11> TWILIGHT AND LUNA ARE BEST PONY
<flyingace11> :)
<flutterbutt> i can identify with fluttershy, because when i was younger, i was quite shy
<flyingace11> But I love them all.
<AdamTheDuck> But there can only be 1 best poneh :<
<Kammerjunk> And when I say "partial", I mean that I have a list of the Mane 6 in order of which ones I like the most, along with descriptions of why.
<Colt_Brovakiin> There is no best pony, it is all down to personal preference :)
<flyingace11> AND relatability
<AdamTheDuck> Lies!
<AdamTheDuck> Spike is best poneh!
<flutterbutt> also, i'm terrified of dragons
<flyingace11> ALL ARE BEST PONEH
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck: their is no true best pony there all just as good as each outher
<Colt_Brovakiin> discord is the best pony :3
<flutterbutt> urgh, i hate saturdays here
<flutterbutt> there's nothing to doooo
<flyingace11> Well it is 7:30
*flutterbutt lives in a tiny little town in scotland
<Kammerjunk> Wait a month or two. Then you'll see just how great Saturdays are.
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: who's top and bottom?
<Phase4> need music
<flyingace11> OOOOOH
<Phase4> that works
<flutterbutt> all there is to do here is drink alcohol
<MadSurge> flyingace11: east coast?
<flyingace11> FUN.
<flyingace11> Yeah, Miami
<flutterbutt> and lounge on a freezing beach
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Twiley and Applejack, respectively. Honestly, AJ and Rarity should share the spot, but then I would only have 5 entries.
<flutterbutt> and find men
<therainbowvortex> flutterbutt: when i 1st became a brony i beat up a good friend for laughing at me i feel bad :(:(
<Kammerjunk> That's not to say I don't like AJ or Rarity, though.
<flutterbutt> but they are usually drunk
<Kammerjunk> I just like the other ones more.
<flutterbutt> therainbowvortex: it's okay, you did it out of love
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: just your least favorites
<flyingace11> FUN BLEASE PHASE
<Kammerjunk> MadSurge: Exactly.
<therainbowvortex> flutterbutt: oh lol
<flyingace11> *+Phase4
<Kammerjunk> flutterbutt: But yeah, you'll probably come to like Saturdays. That's when new episodes come out.
<flutterbutt> don't call them punches, call them love landings.
<Phase4> ?
<AdamTheDuck> Damnit Phase4, I was about to link a song :$
<flyingace11> Fun.
<Phase4> too late :P
<therainbowvortex> pinkie pie is so awsome i just want to hug her
<flyingace11> Ok :$
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: even RD has her moments (my least favorite)
<flutterbutt> Pinkie is my second favoruite pony
<flutterbutt> i love happy bouncy people like that
<MadSurge> ^
<Kammerjunk> Dashie's actually second on my list with Pinkie being third. I don't know, I think I just consider her more adorable than awesome.
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02Night all :)

<RainbowPie> Hey everypony
<cowvarkian> ah, a new person to sortof talk a little
<Ponies47> Hey RainbowPie
<cowvarkian> also hey, RainbowPie
<Lunac> lol not normally much on stream this time of week so naturally very few peoplep talking.
<cowvarkian> Lunac: by this time of week you mean the morning on weekend?
<Ponies47> It still early (for me atleast) in 'Merica
<RainbowPie> is anyone good with computers here? :3
<cowvarkian> RainbowPie: probably
<Lunac> No early afternoon anytime in the week
<Lunac> GMT of course
<cowvarkian> Ponies47: its like 9 am here on the east coast
<Ponies47> RainbowPie: Phase4 is pretty good with PC's
<RainbowPie> Well im looking for bootmgr, but its not in my C:\ .. any idea where it would be?
<Ponies47> cowvarkian: Little past 8:00 AM here
<Phase4> RainbowPie, its stored on a different partition, why are you looking for bootmgr?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe it's hidden.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Do you have your hidden folders shown?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nvm,
<RainbowPie> Phase4, Ive looked on all my partitions its no there
<RainbowPie> Nittany_Discord, I was going to customize it. I did it for my last laptop
<Ponies47> What is with cats walking up on computer equipment? ._.
<Lunac> Anyone streaming? It;s a hame we can;t just input a You Tube playlist and play it.
<RainbowPie> Nittany_Discord, sorry that last message was for Phase4 haha yeah i'm showing hidden folders
<Kammerjunk> Keyboards are so damn comfy.
<Phase4> RainbowPie, system partition, its normally not mapped, i can tell you how to get to it but would like to know why first
<RainbowPie> Phase4: Im customizing the boot up screen
<Phase4> that can break everything, but if your sure
<Phase4> RainbowPie, in the start menu, type 'computer managment', should come up with one result
<RainbowPie> I did 'bcdedit' in cmd and it says tha path is in "\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi
<Phase4> thats an nt native path, useless to you cause windows is in the way
<RainbowPie> ah okay
<RainbowPie> Phase4: So i open computer management
<Phase4> RainbowPie, once you get computer managment open, there should be a list on the left
<Phase4> click disk managment
<RainbowPie> yep
<Phase4> RainbowPie, from there you should see a partition called 'system reserved'
<Dark92Enigma> ok.....i'M Back! who's on Skype?
<Phase4> you see it?
<RainbowPie> uhm nope
<Phase4> ok.... i'm not sure where you are then
<Phase4> windows 7 right?
<RainbowPie> theres my 2 hard disks and a "(EFI System Partition)"
<RainbowPie> yes
<RainbowPie> Do you have team viewer? maybe you can take a look for youself
<RainbowPie> you might see something im not seeing
<Phase4> ok, does the efi system partition have a drive letter?
<Phase4> i'll start teamviewer if you want
<RainbowPie> okay
<RainbowPie> Ill Private Message you the details
<DerpyMuffins> Thats a new shipping I never saw before
<DerpyMuffins> Rainbow X Pinkie
<RainbowPie> hehe
*Ponies47 Slaps DerpyMuffins
<Ponies47> No -_-
<DerpyMuffins> Whats wrong with that shipping?
<sparkarez> Applejack + Pinkie Pie = ApplePie
<Bronysith> twiluna is great shipping
<DerpyMuffins> Twixie is where its at
<Bronysith> also great r34 *COUGH COUGH COUGH*
<Kammerjunk> DerpyMuffins: This.
<Kammerjunk> Also, I kinda like TwiShy.
<Tovler> Flutterjack is non-existant
<DerpyMuffins> Yup
<DerpyMuffins> They just dont go together
<Bronysith> i like twiluna the best
<DerpyMuffins> Twilestia is better
<Bronysith> twilestia was a very good clopfic
<DerpyMuffins> Wait, why are there so many Twi shipping?
<sparkarez> I don't like r34
<Kammerjunk> DerpyMuffins: Because adorkableness.
<DerpyMuffins> Twilight is like otakon
<Tovler> imagine everyone trying to think of a canon time Flutterjack were together.
<Ponies47> I don't care about R34. I just ignore it
<Saturn> 08,01i do.
<DerpyMuffins> Twilight X everyone basicly
<sparkarez> It doesn't ruin the show for me but I just don't like it
<Bronysith> Saturn: and i love the r34
<Saturn> 08,01but no r34 talk in here
<Bronysith> fair enough
<Saturn> 08,01or else i swing my massive, hard, throbbing banhammer
<Kammerjunk> oh my
<DerpyMuffins> Throbbing?
<Ponies47> O.O
<RainbowPie> Its waiting to explode and ban everyone
<LightTrooper105> hallo everypony o.o
<Saturn> 08,01throbbing.
<Kandarihu> Yeah, let's not go there.
<Saturn> 08,01you heard me.
<RainbowPie> hello LightTrooper105
<Saturn> 08,01it throbs.
<LightTrooper105> how?
<DerpyMuffins> I dont want to know
<Saturn> 08,01LightTrooper105: it's made of meat
<Jmo> ^
<Tovler> even Pinkiedash existed in Griffon the Brush off and Party of One
<Saturn> 08,01living meat
<Jmo> tmi
<Saturn> 08,01inb4 gasp
<Kammerjunk> That reminds me of a TF2 Bat model+skin I once saw.
<Ponies47> Hello LightTrooper105
<LightTrooper105> well that just plain disturbing..
<Saturn> 08,01it's basically like a Leviathan from Farscape
<Saturn> 08,01except it's a banhammer
<Kandarihu> Well, I don't recall Leviathans throbbing much. They're kind of biomechanical anyway.
<LightTrooper105> ok..
<Bronysith> YAY, downloading Wakfu
<Kammerjunk> This chat takes such lovely turns.
<LightTrooper105> indeed..
<Saturn> 08,01and now, a stream
<Alister|Asleep> test
<Saturn> 08,01hi Alister|Asleep
<LightTrooper105> a stream? o.o
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh hai Saturn.
<LightTrooper105> lol..
<Ponies47> Yay Saturn stream!
<Kandarihu> Uh oh.
<Kandarihu> It's just an external drive, right?
<DerpyMuffins> Saturn stream?
<cowvarkian> ohai Saturn
<Dark_Horst> probably stolen by garden gnomes
<cowvarkian> I come back from getting my frozen indian food, and saturn is here
<Bronysith> haha
<Ponies47> How do you remeber all of this stuff Saturn!?!!?
<Bronysith> the kill your family show <3
<Bronysith> Ponies47: hes intelligent
<Saturn> 08,01this guy is AMAZING
<alexxm> huh what is this
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cowvarkian is eating frozen Indians.
<Lil_B> aand suddenly Bagpipes Oo
<Flyboy> wut
<Dark_Horst> that, my freind, is a bagpipe
<cowvarkian> Nittany_Discord: totally
<LightTrooper105> hmm brb
<cowvarkian> Nittany_Discord: I am an american
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mmm. Dark meat.
<Saturn> 08,01this is ancient instruments being played by an awesome dude called David Munrow
<Saturn> 08,01who is now, sadly, dead
<Lunac> If in heaven you have a harp inhell you have bapipes
<Saturn> 08,01but he was a right character
<alexxm> what did hw siw of
<Saturn> 08,01and an absolutely fantastic musician
<alexxm> what did he die of
<DerpyMuffins> Bagpipes are mis treated
<Saturn> 08,01alexxm: he committed suicide
<DerpyMuffins> Miss
<Lil_B> my dad loved the german anthem yesterday in the soocer match VS Irland
<Lil_B> because it had Bagpipes :)
<Kammerjunk> I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks bagpipes sound pretty good
<Saturn> 08,01so these are all ancient instruments from different parts of the world
<alexxm> oh shame to hear that Saturn he seems good at this stuff
<Saturn> 08,01and ancient tunes
<Kammerjunk> In some circumstances, at any rate.
<Lil_B> I really like the jew harp
<Lil_B> if that's what it's called
<Saturn> 08,01all from generally about 1400 - 1650
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: >.> for some reason I dont think its called that anymore
<DerpyMuffins> Reed pipes?
<FlaschenJoe11> hello everypony
<Tovler> hm. so that's what a clavichord is
<Lil_B> cowvarkian but that's the only namw for it I know :/
<Lil_B> hey FlaschenJoe11
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: meh, i dunno
<Saturn> 08,01this is a french/celtic harp
<alexxm> how are things Flaschen```joe22
<Saturn> 08,01also known as a clarsach
<DerpyMuffins> A french harp?
<Kammerjunk> Well, it's still called a jew harp.
<alexxm> how are things FlaschenJoe22
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: maultrommel. there, now you nhave a new one^^
<cowvarkian> Saturn: will he play a butsac eventually?
<Kammerjunk> But it's also called a jaw harp, mouth harp, or even trump.
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst xD but it's hardly a Trommel xD
<Saturn> 08,01cowvarkian: sackbutt, and i think so
<Saturn> 08,01unless i'm thinking of a different video
<DerpyMuffins> Viola?
<Saturn> 08,01these are insturments called viols
<cowvarkian> Saturn: ah that yes, I knew it was something in the range of hilarity
<FlaschenJoe11> alexxm: Not bad, plan to watch Expendables 2 this evening.
<Saturn> 08,01they're more like guitars and double basses than violins and cellos
<Saturn> 08,01i actually used to be in a viol consort
<DerpyMuffins> How was it?
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: not really. but hey, they named stuff funny back then
<Saturn> 08,01i got to play a few 300 and 400 year old viols
<Kammerjunk> Isn't a viol just any one of a family of that kind of instrument?
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst "Dudelsack"
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: yup
<Saturn> 08,01these are two tenor viols, i think
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: for instance
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: thanks for making me spit up my food
<Lil_B> cowvarkian wut? xD
<Dark_Horst> cowvarkian: that's the word for bagpipe, btw^^
<Saturn> 08,01so here we have a clarsach, a zither (the horizontal thing), and what looks like either a mandolin or a bala laika
<Saturn> 08,01nah, actually, i think it's neither
<Saturn> 08,01i've no idea what that is
<cowvarkian> I need to show these to my music teacher who knows nothing about music
<Lil_B> Saturn Mandolin probably, Bala Laikas are usially Triangular
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: aye
<String_Shredder> Saturn: It looks like a very small lute to me
<DerpyMuffins> Its a lyre if I remember correctly
<Saturn> 08,01but mandolins are double stringed
<Lil_B> Saturn and it seems to be 4x2 Sites so I think its a mandolinm
<Saturn> 08,01String_Shredder: maybe
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350092970628.png
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: have a heart attack, because something impossible happened
<Lil_B> the Zither :) ... I love it in the Third Man xD
<Bronysith> suddenly i feel like im playing Legend of Dragoon
*Saturn 08,01wishes he remembered more about his medieval music
<Saturn> 08,01i used to specialise in baroque music, actually
<Bronysith> Saturn: may this guy R.I.P
<Saturn> 08,01hence the viols
<cowvarkian> Saturn: >.>
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: aye, he was absolutely awesome; i'd have *loved* to meet him
<Bronysith> i like this style of music
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: good
<String_Shredder> man, that's a big tambourine
<Lil_B> He is rocking this instrument like crazy xD
<cowvarkian> inb4 gif
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: he actually made a series about medieval music; i'll see if i can get hold of it and stream it
<Dark_Horst> i think i saw those horns on medieval paintings
<Dark_Horst> dont remmber where they came fromt hough
<Bronysith> Saturn: that would be pretty wizard
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: I remember that...
<cowvarkian> wizard...
<cowvarkian> silly word
<Saturn> 08,01oh, also, i'm a a bit obsessed with bells
<Saturn> 08,01i find bells amazing
<Wrek> 05andrew bell
<cowvarkian> Saturn: not surprising
<Wrek> 05harr darr
<cowvarkian> Wrek: ohai wrek
<Saturn> 08,01because they don't produce a note, they produce (essentially) a chord
<DerpyMuffins> Dat weak joke
<Lil_B> I like Bells, but I can only Find Tabular Bells Samples, I want really big Church Bell Samples
<Bronysith> hi Wrek how goes the plushie cuddles?
<cowvarkian> Wrek: I'm assuming I shouldn't mention the conversation we had last night about shipping otakon
<String_Shredder> is that some sort of organ or a mellotron he's playing in the background?
<Wrek> 05the plushie cuddles are errywhere
<Saturn> 08,01there's an instrument called a carilon, which is a load of bells with hammers attached to a keyboard of levers
<Saturn> 08,01you hit the levers to play the bells
<cowvarkian> String_Shredder: mellotron... that sounds like a bad transformer
<Saturn> 08,01i got to play on one in a church in amsterdam when i visit my boyfriend last month
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350100365388.jpg
<cowvarkian> Saturn: seems legit
<Saturn> 08,01String_Shredder: it's an organ
<cowvarkian> and bronysith still placing out of context pictures
<Saturn> 08,01String_Shredder: melotrons weren'yt invented until the 60s, i think
<cowvarkian> Saturn: the 1660's?
<Dark_Horst> that looks like a bagpipe, but different
<DerpyMuffins> No one has made a NMM Plushie yet surprisingly
<Lil_B> I once saw someone trying to make Jazz via a Bagpipe, it didn't work... it just didn't Swing
<DerpyMuffins> I would kill for one
<String_Shredder> Yeah, but they could have one just in case they couldn't find threal instument.
<Saturn> 08,01so far as i remember, a mellotron is an electronic insturment that uses tapes
<String_Shredder|AFK> *the real
<Saturn> 08,01medieval music is really fascinating
<String_Shredder|AFK> Saturn: Most famously used on Strawberry Fields Forever
<Saturn> 08,01i encourage anyone who is enjoying this to buy a book on the subject, or look for videos about it on youtube
<Saturn> 08,01or buy David Munrow's series about it
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350107949861.gif
<cowvarkian> he's going hardcore into that recorder
<Lil_B> Saturn can you give me a name again of this guy so I can search for him?
<cowvarkian> playing it quite well
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: David Munrow
<Lil_B> Saturn I shoulkd have looked at the chat while typing >.<
<Saturn> 08,01also, i don't think people appreciate how awesome recorders are
<Saturn> 08,01in the UK, we're forced to learn them at school
<Dark_Horst> ....i think we once had that string instrument he's playing there once in our cellar
<Saturn> 08,01in primary school
<Bronysith> damn it Saturn now you made me wanna play legend of dragoon
<Dark_Horst> was hopelessy broken though as far as i can remmber
<SuperSanjitenks1989> What in the blue hell is this
<cowvarkian> Saturn: with the shitty plastic ones?
<Bronysith|Dragoon> there we go
<Saturn> 08,01but they're actually a legit and awesome baroque insturment
<Saturn> 08,01when i was at music school, one of my friends was a first-study recorder player
<Lil_B> if a "Recorder" is a Blockflöte in Germany, than yes, most Joung Kids in Primary School who play an instrument play this particular one
<Dark_Horst> SuperSanjitenks1989: mediaval music
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: blockflote, aye
*Saturn 08,01can't type umlauts
<Bronysith|Dragoon> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350111977863.gif
<J_E_Smith71> Wait Saturn, why are you starting a Misfits episode? Is Sumica not doing a Hub stream this morning?(Starts in 10 minutes)
<cowvarkian> killing and dying and stuff
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Yay crimmus
<Dark_Horst> oh, those. i aced them in music class. as far as the standart went. meaning i was just the least bad player in the room xD
<Bronysith|Dragoon> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350112300064.gif Saturn i heard you like the matrix
<cowvarkian> and this is why people suck
<Lil_B> Saturn no prop :) earlier I was always confused because a Recorder was something to record something with xD
<Sonny> How's it going evepony :D
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<cowvarkian> Saturn: didnt you say you were going to stop streaming this?
<Lil_B> whats the black dudes ability?
<Saturn> 08,01cowvarkian: >.>
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: to be an asshat
<Dark_Horst> simon begins
<cowvarkian> no wait, everyones an asshat on this show
<SuperSanjitenks1989> we just witnessed sfw porn
<cowvarkian> Saturn: <.<
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: he can rewind time
<cowvarkian> hey, latin
<SuperSanjitenks1989> i don't like that\
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: not travel, just rewind
<cowvarkian> work for money
<TheKoreanBrony1354> good song
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst ah... I don'Ät quite get the concept, but ok :/
<Kandarihu> Uh, Saturn, Sumica's taking over in 8 minutes.
<Jmo> Zapped by lightning and got super powers.
<Jmo> easy concept
<Jmo> :>
<cowvarkian> <.<
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: thats what you think
<pony_7902> :D
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: instead of travelling back with all the paradox bullshit of parallel timelines and meeting yourself and whatnot, he just rewinds everthing
<Dark_Horst> Lil_B: like a magic remote
<SuperSanjitenks1989> a bearded man, a virgin, and a horny donkey
<cowvarkian> SuperSanjitenks1989: a porno?
<Lil_B> Dark_Horst so we can say, he does something and X happens, he can rewind everythin, and do something so X doesn't happen?
<Dark_Horst> yep
<cowvarkian> so drink water, beer just dehydrates you
<Dark_Horst> he still rmembers it happened though, which makes it usefull
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back!.......who is on Skype?
<Kandarihu> cowvarkian, but the live episodes are coming on the HUB next hour. Sumica's been streaming it live to get used to it for when S3 premiers
<Dark_Horst> so far it only actuvated when his friends died though
<Lil_B> or drink destilled water, it will dehydrate you even more xD
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: I know
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: >.>
<Saturn> 08,01oh
<Dark92Enigma> Hello?
<cowvarkian> Kandarihu: I wasn't actually being sincere
<Dark_Horst> just drink saltwater
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: he is?
<Blako> hi Cynder7
<Lil_B> cowvarkian also, in the medical times, it was safer to get your H2O via Beer than water because the Breweries mostly got fresh water insetad of the infekted Waters elsewhere :P
<Lil_B> why did I even bother to write this?
<Kandarihu> Saturn, yes. He's been doing that every Saturday morning
<Dark_Horst> "dont wanna poke the baby in the exe"
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: what's he streaming?
<Dark_Horst> *eye
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: no clue
<DerpyMuffins> This show looks really messed up

<Jmo> LOL
<Colt_Brovakiin> haha
<ASoftFluffyThing> Yep
<Kandarihu> However, considering the fact that Hasbro just gave out a number of promotionals for Season 3, the chances of an ad for it announcing the premier date is considerably higher.
<Saturn> 08,01ASoftFluffyThing: must be me streaming?
*ASoftFluffyThing hugs Jmo and Lil_B
<Dark92Enigma> AND HIS FRIEND PETER!!!!!! WOOOO!

<DerpyMuffins> This show is fucked up and in more than one way

<cowvarkian> DerpyMuffins: hmm
<Saturn> 08,01but it's also wonderful
<Lyra`> fair more experience loover

<Lyra`> such a nice guy :3
<DerpyMuffins> So Santa is giving out condoms?
<Lil_B> I don't really like this show much :/
<Dark_Horst> he seems to have no mental concept of "too much information"
<Lil_B> but it has quite the greyscale
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyMuffins: cough sweets
<Dark92Enigma> What's the name of this show again?
<Saturn> 08,01really, really strong cough sweets

<Dark92Enigma> even the title is weird
<Lil_B> Fishermans Friend is awesome xD exspecially the really intense ones xD
<Lyra`> i love immortality, why did he give it up :(
<DerpyMuffins> You can make more money with immortality
<alexxm> cowvarkian perhaps he wants to spend the rest of his life with her
<cowvarkian> long and totally ridiculous story...
<Dark92Enigma> cowvarkian: What does >.> mean?
<Lil_B> and suddenly I feel insulted :/
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: it means >.>
<Dark92Enigma> ok

<Dark92Enigma> USE THE FORCE
<cowvarkian> and then shoots the bugger
<Lil_B> he isn't Jesus, he's a Jedi
<ASoftFluffyThing> HE'S A JEDI?!

<Kandarihu> Uh, Go and Sin no More?
<Lyra`> jesus has a spa?
<cowvarkian> Saturn: I claim vampire
<Lyra`> sue de la sandal?
<Lil_B> I think the "Well, good he came back for Chrismas Time"-Line xD
<Lil_B> I liked
<Barbetos|AtWork> Jesus was also a very sad looking guy. Have you ever seen a picture of him smiling. And I am not talking about buddy Jesus
<Kandarihu> Zombies are less of who they were when they were alive.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Budy Jesus rocks btw
<Kandarihu> Barbetos|AtWork, you're talking about the artwork.
<Blako> I have one very old pc (but I don't use it) and it is broken all the time.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yeah. I suppose "official" art
<alexxm> no but there is a guy calling himself jesus
<Barbetos|AtWork> There is a lot of fan fics out there about him.
<Barbetos|AtWork> and fan art.
<Blako> Often it is because of HDD.
<Barbetos|AtWork> XD
<doctor_whooves127> yeah but what if there is a general zod
<Barbetos|AtWork> Okay I am goign to stop.
<Cynder7> 6:O
<Lyra`> lying bitch!
<Lyra`> LYING BITCH!
<Blako> so it is quite unusable... I wonder why we still have it there :D
<cowvarkian> doctor_whooves127: ergo, the guy they were selling them to?

<Barbetos|AtWork> Lyra` BITCH!!
<Barbetos|AtWork> I know!
<doctor_whooves127> duh
<Barbetos|AtWork> I mean lying!
<Cynder7> 6xDD
<Lyra`> i wish there was a tier three caps lock, so i could express my anger!
<cowvarkian> Lyra`: indeed
<Barbetos|AtWork> You need the anger modification key on your keyboard
<Lil_B> she wanna give him sex lessons?
<Barbetos|AtWork> I had a sarcasm one installed, but it no work
<Lyra`> also, Barbetos|AtWork, did you call me a bitch?
<cowvarkian> Barbetos|AtWork: it was being sarcastic
<Ryunosuke> and now sexy time
<Dark92Enigma> WHA------
<Barbetos|AtWork> Lyra`: What? But Lyra is BEST pony! I would never.
<DerpyMuffins> This song always gave me chills
<Dark92Enigma> Ok....this movie has gone.....a little bit too far 6_9
<DerpyMuffins> Now even more when watching this
<Jmo> lolmovie
<Lil_B> Dark92Enigma it's a show
<cowvarkian> and then villain
<Blako> even that very old one where we had win95 had less problems, but it was extremly slow. I still have win95 manual somewhere
<Lyra`> Saturn, i want to trade in friendhship points to kick Barbetos|AtWork one time
<Ryunosuke> "I want what she's having"
<Dark92Enigma> Lil_B: oh, thanks i almost forgot

<cowvarkian> Saturn: combat engineer
<FlutterMEDIC> Lyra`: dude, i've seen what the Japanese did to captured soldiers in Iwo Jima in pictures, i've seen the products of vicious predator attacks, i've seen a man being DISINTEGRATED.

<RDash5000> sup Ponies47
<OneTrickPony> wb Ponies47
<waterinaglass> Hello There
<cowvarkian> FlutterMEDIC: have you actually seen it, or just seen it in pictures
<Ponies47> Tanks guys <3
<Lyra`> so i jump up, start running, and i see a group of people huddled around a guy
<Lyra`> all i can see is the legs
<FlutterMEDIC> cowvarkian: LOTS of pictures
<Barbetos|AtWork> oh hai mark!
<cowvarkian> FlutterMEDIC: I don't think that exactly compares
<Lyra`> i start pushing people out of the way, and when i get a good look at him, i see that hes blown off his lower jaw, and his face was split up the middle.
<Lyra`> i could see his esophagus and tracheal tubes.
<RDash5000> Lyra`: damn.
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`: did he died?
<Lyra`> his tongue was hanging by a scrap of muscle, but still twitching.
<Spectrum_Rush> now is this really nessecary this conversation
<Lyra`> well, yeah, eventually he killed himself.
<Saturn> 08,01eventually?
<Lyra`> i must have sat there packing quick clot gauze into his wound for a good 5 minutes.
<cowvarkian> Lyra`: damn
<RDash5000> Lyra`: killed himself?
<Lyra`> he just wouldnt stop bleeding.
<cowvarkian> Lyra`: where were you
<Lyra`> yeah, he survived.
<doctor_whooves127> ah he's billy numerous
<Dark_Horst> so, what is a 12b and how did he thing chewing blasting caps was a good idea?
<cowvarkian> Lyra`: I know it was just an excerise, but was it on the field, or at a base
<Lyra`> but he didnt have a face anymore, and he looked like a monster out of dead space.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Princess?
<thelonepony> hi Combustiblelemons :)
<Kandarihu> Princes
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kandarihu, I still despise that
<Combustiblelemons> tis not the 1800s
<LordDerpington> rdibp|evil: It's in the 1930s.
<Kammerjunk> 1930s, isn't it?
<SirGanjalf> rdibp|evil: 1800's?
<rdibp|evil> WITH THE LEMONS
<pot80> was using headphones, ears just died a little
<Combustiblelemons> it's the 1930s
<Socks> This isn't the 1800s
<ASoftFluffyThing> This will be fun
<SirGanjalf> it's after WWI
<rdibp|evil> it looks like the 1800s
<vanemare> its 1934
<Lil_B> thats why I never turn my Volume fully up :P
<SirGanjalf> not much
<LordDerpington> It looks nothing like the 1800s.
<d3rb> its england, everything looks old
<Kencolt> Guess who loses the bet.

<rdibp|evil> POCUS
<Socks> Well it isn't
<CrimsonPhoenix> woah rdibp|evil you need to revise your history
<SirGanjalf> 1800's would look more like in Sherlock Holmes movie.
<Sumica> 00,10they probably called it new age
<Vash> this is not the 1800s, and headphones were invented in 19 century
<Socks> 1800s think what blackadder the third looks like
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: beethoven lived 2 centuries before them though

<LordDerpington> rdibp|evil: He was talking about the recordable gramophone.
<Combustiblelemons> louder!
<Kandarihu> This is sometime between 1925-1936. Headphones were invented. Headphone rape wouldn't come until a better part of a century later... on Youtube
<Barbetos|AtWork> The frames
<Socks> Because sound recording wasn't invented until after 1900s
<Barbetos|AtWork> what.. is going on?

<SirGanjalf> Malmortius: Be patient.
<Kandarihu> Combustiblelemons, outside of official events, the mods do whatever. Wrek does gaming and drawing mostly

<CrimsonPhoenix> but seriously Malmortius explore the website a bit and you'll see what's Bronystate about
<Barbetos|AtWork> Over clocked!
<Malmortius> Im not butthurt, but .. a MLP site with a stream, seems a bit off that i havent once seen MLP

<d3rb> Malmortius, only so many pony eps, it would get old
<rdibp|evil> oh
<MadSurge> rdibp|evil: he asked for... ponies...
<AJIsAwesome> Malmortius: It's not really an MLP site, more of a streaming site.
<Conyst> baby scootaloo
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: while blaring Gangnam style on the intercom for lulz
<Combustiblelemons> Ponies will be here... in time.
<Kammerjunk> Malmortius: No, this is for bronies who like watching films. What is currently streaming is movie night. When new episodes air, they will be streamed live here.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, It's a Brony site for Brony people

<Invi> Lil_B, KonsolN?
<Saturn> 08,01i donj't get you guys sometimes

<Saturn> 08,01just because someone asks if ponies are going to be streamed, doesn't mean they are complaining

<Conyst> I only know I'm insane.
*rdibp|evil agrees with Saturn
<Malmortius> Exactly Saturn :l how was i supposed to know what happens here

<prince-dari> [19:45] <Malmortius> Oh for god sakes, ive been coming here every day and not once have i seen my little pony
<Tassadork> when I first showed up
<Barbetos|AtWork> The aggression comes from what people don't want to see. And this is also a very good time to point out the trolls using the mods to their own agenda. IE they ask for ponies, everyone gets G3.5. Troll wins. < Saturn
<prince-dari> That is complaining

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Malmortius: Wait an hour more.
<prince-dari> Not "Are you guy going to stream MLP any time soon?"
<Kammerjunk> Now remember, Malmortius is NOT whining.
<GabeMoist> Tassadork, we aren't your typical bronies
<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: 'ccept he isn't or at least the name malmortius has appeared in chat for months now
<LordDerpington> I discovered Bronystate for the live new episode streams, but I stayed for the movies. And the chat, of course.
<BronyInstrumental> i'm with dari on this one
<MadSurge> Tassadork: well, not everyone likes ponies 24/7 :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> LordDerpington, me too
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> theres always a negative connotation around used car salespeople.
<Combustiblelemons> Suddenly, a flamewar.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> :P
<SirGanjalf> My father died recently dum dum dumdum...
<AJIsAwesome> LordDerpington: Same here.
<Malmortius> prince-dari at least im complaining, and not whining :(
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: was that his first comment, or was that in response to hostility?
<rdibp|evil> dumdumdum
<HavokOC> "Complaining? I'm not complaining. THIS. Is. Complaining: <complain here>"
<Tassadork> MadSurge: exactly. the diversity of stuff actually works out much better
<d3rb> Malmortius, the question gets asked that often that it gets old, if you had browsed over the about page or rules you would know about the frequency of eps shown
<prince-dari> His first comment
<CrimsonPhoenix> prince-dari, first comment
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> People always come here and think im out to rip them off, even though I sell new trailers.
<d3rb> Malmortius, dont take it personaly
*MadSurge waits for Sumirage
<Socks> Do dah! Do dah!
<Kammerjunk> While I still believe everyone should read the FAQ, I still think it's better for everyone if the situation is calmly explained.
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn still has a point, even if not in this particular case
<rdibp|evil> prince-dari: you keep records on everyone comment? :O
<J_E_Smith71> Five minutes till the first fan made ep starts
<Stormy_> I guess he hears some noise in it or something so we're getting it checked out now
<Invi> twilight_sprinkle, both have
<SirGanjalf> hah
<rdibp|evil> doctor who?
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Hmm?
<Malmortius> to be honest no one reads the FAQ unless they're asked too :l not a good argument. i doubt most of you here read the FAQ to begin with.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I have the feeling that someone will be kicked....
<SirGanjalf> Doctor Barbossa
<ASoftFluffyThing> Darn my sixth sense.
<Socks> Smith71 what are you talking about?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ok guys can you put this argument to a stop and enjoy the movie?
<pot80> remember guys tolerate... oh also possibly love as well
<Conyst> Sing for us
<Socks> *J_ESmith71
<Combustiblelemons> This was fun in the 30s?
<twilight_sprinkle> btw is this movie based on real events?
<DerpyMuffins> Shouldnt we be enjoying the movie instead of arguing?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Malmortius, fun fact I did read FAQ, rules and the About Us when I was interested in the site
<twilight_sprinkle> i mean the stuttering before the speech
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: yes
<SirGanjalf> Combustiblelemons: chasing girls? sure
<Conyst> This is always fun.
<ASoftFluffyThing> DerpyMuffins, yes.
<Kandarihu> Love is more important than tolerance
<rdibp|evil> personally, i dont love and tolerate. just ignore everyone
<Socks> The movie is based on real events
<Spectrum_Rush> no reads the faq unless asked to... I READ IT THE FIRST DAY I WAS HERE
<SirGanjalf> twilight_sprinkle: yes
<Combustiblelemons> glueing planes together SirGanjalf :S
<twilight_sprinkle> okay
<Saturn> 08,01okay, well even if someone comes in and complains, that doesn't give anyone the right to blow up at them about it. the thing to do is to calmly explain that this is a brony streaming community, not an mlp stream
<d3rb> Malmortius, all this aside, welcome to bronystate, we are nice 90% of the time
<SirGanjalf> Combustiblelemons: well some people, find this entertaining even today, so yes
<MadSurge> Ooo modeling :)
<prince-dari> Which is what most people did do?
<Sylandest> exactly, Saturn. Well said.
<Saturn> 08,01*not specifidcally an mlp stream
<HavokOC> He sounds´
<pot80> twilight_sprinkle in the words of the movie 300 "THIS IS" historically incorrect :P
<HavokOC> Really drunk
<Malmortius> think ill just watch from now on, im out.
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: often not actually
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: not really. most times when i see this happen, people go off on one to them
<rdibp|evil> ALRIGHT THAT IS ENOUGH! lets just watch the movie and put the past behind us OKAY!? :[
<Socks> pot80 :D
<twilight_sprinkle> pot80: wait so its not historically correct?
<SirGanjalf> Also: 30's - when left handed people were worst people:(
<SirGanjalf> *worse
<Malmortius> left handers unite! woo!
<Kandarihu> We-don't-al-ways-stream-po-nies. Do dah Do dah
<Combustiblelemons> I tried putting a plane together once. The parts fell apart due to the glue :/
<Lil_B> oh man I love reading this Youtube Comments... wait... this sin't youtube, this is Bronystate
<rdibp|evil> Saturn: i wasent talking about you :(
<pot80> twilight_sprincle it isnt exact events though some have been dramatised
<prince-dari> [19:47] <CrimsonPhoenix> but seriously Malmortius explore the website a bit and you'll see what's Bronystate about
<prince-dari> [19:47] <d3rb> Malmortius, only so many pony eps, it would get old
<prince-dari> [19:48] <AJIsAwesome> Malmortius: It's not really an MLP site, more of a streaming site.
<HavokOC> i heard error
<SirGanjalf> shhh
<Combustiblelemons> Chucked it out of my bedroom window when it was done, fell like a stone.
<prince-dari> [19:48] <Kammerjunk> Malmortius: No, this is for bronies who like watching films. What is currently streaming is movie night. When new episodes air, they will be streamed live here.
<SirGanjalf> this scene has feels
<Combustiblelemons> Fun... not really at all.
<prince-dari> Most comments seem fairly civil to me.
<MadSurge> Combustiblelemons: you need strong glue for those
<BronyInstrumental> dem dari colours
<SirGanjalf> :(
<Kammerjunk> Man, this guy can sing.
<Malmortius> stop picking and choosing prince-dari. you are the worst type of fake.
<d3rb> yay, i was civil!
<CrimsonPhoenix> I feel quite important now
<rdibp|evil> when did bronystate become youtube comment flame wars?
<Spectrum_Rush> Lil_B: this is the internet
<Barbetos|AtWork> And that is missing the point.
<Kandarihu> Chat-is-get-ting-dis-stract-ing, oh the doo dah day
<Malmortius> you're just filtering out all the negative comments.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh well.
<BronyInstrumental> i feel a banhammer-a-brewin'
<DerpyMuffins> Since when did this become 4 chan?
<Lil_B> Spectrum_Rush I'm sorrry, I thouzght this 's AMERICA
<ASoftFluffyThing> BronyInstrumental, so do I
<SirGanjalf> Lil_B: :D
<rdibp|evil> :O

<Malmortius> inb4 censorship
<ASoftFluffyThing> BronyInstrumental, I can feel it in my back
<BronyInstrumental> ASoftFluffyThing: QUICK! To the bunker!
<Cameh_Dude> Kandarihu /)*(\
<prince-dari> Malmortius: People explained to you that we don't show MLP all the time.
<Stormy_> Guess I wad wrong :/

<rdibp|evil> inb4 inb4
<GabeMoist> inafter inb4
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: its a rare exception then. saturns right, people often get yelled at for asking it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> also remember what your buying… it is almost 13 years old.
*ASoftFluffyThing hides in the bunker with BronyInstrumental
<Saturn> 08,01also, Malmortius: people are explaining to you what we stream.
<Panda> .... what the hell did I walk back in on???
<Kammerjunk> rdibp|evil - GabeMoist: Dat timing.

<Saturn> 08,01don't get upset if that's not what you expected
*BronyInstrumental hides in the anti-ban bunker with ASoftFluffyThing
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> when I was selling my '99 Rav4, people were looking at it and pointing out flaws like it was a new car
<Conyst> Hello Panda
<Malmortius> I got the point long ago, guys... long ago. Like, within the first 3 sentences.
<Spectrum_Rush> Lil_B: *touche :S

<Saturn> 08,01Malmortius: they're tryign to be helpful
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I told them to go across the street to the toyota dealer if they were looking for a new car, because this one was 13 years old.
<twilight_sprinkle> pot80: heh its ok, thx for explaining :P btw press tab when typing a name for it to autocomplete
<SirGanjalf> Geoffrey Rush is an Aussie, isn;t he?
*Lil_B huggles Panda

<pot80> thanks twilight_sprinkle
<DerpyMuffins> Fluttershy?
<rdibp|evil> scottish cock?
<CrimsonPhoenix> One more thing Malmortius if you knew my reason why I picked this specific movie you would feel a small bit of MLP in this movie
<Stormy_> I just don't want it to break down on me
*ASoftFluffyThing scoops thelonepony and MadSurge into anti-ban bunkt
<Spectrum_Rush> Invi: scheisse
