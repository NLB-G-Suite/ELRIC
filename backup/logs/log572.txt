<OohShiny> TONS OF FUN
<Calcos323> MaxTheSweedishBrony: I can. I also hate the Trixie Episode
<Minion> 1,11The overal consensus I'm finding for Rises seems to be that it's a great movie, but it falls short on being a Batman Sequel for the Nolanverse. People are underwhelmed by how Bane exits the film [not posted here due to spoilers, and I haven't seen it yet...] and admit it's full of plot holes in the story. Many (including myself) Highly doubt it'll top Avengers in the Box office.
<Tigertonic_The_Cat> BIG ADVENTURE TONS OF FUN A BEAUTIFUL HEART FAITHFUL AND STRONG
<_Dan> Fou_Lou: truth :D
<Kammerjunk> Alejandro is Scoot-Scootaloo, yes?

Maybe he should just sit down and think a little, come up with a decent thought, perhaps an argument on the current state of soceity's understanding of "art" and make a worthwhile statement that will make others join him in an engaging conversation. Wouldn' that be better than just saying random things like

<Meanwhile> Hahaha
<Dovahkiin> 1,11If season 3 is the last season, I can see a sh*tload of bronies coming together to form Ponyville Adventures or something like that...
<Ghosties> 04Or Rotten Tomatoes
<Saturn> 08,01Dark Crystal!
<otakon> I would give up ponies for that
<Ghosties> 04Whichever
<SlurryMoon> 3oh
<Saturn> 08,01\o/
<Meanwhile> Really?
<SlurryMoon> 3that movie
<Saturn> 08,01but i'm not sure if it's an A
<FlaschenJoe11> The Dark Crystal!!!
<SlurryMoon> 3I know that one
<Dovahkiin> 1,11DARK CRYSTAL?!
<Meanwhile> REALLY?
<Dovahkiin> 1,11Ho shit.
<SlurryMoon> 3it's the one with the puppets
<otakon> Yes
<SlurryMoon> 3personally, I hated it
<otakon> to not have to go out and just watch it here?
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Saturn> 08,01it's kind of the spiritual successor to labyrinth
<SlurryMoon> 3but let's see what imdb says
<Meanwhile> Inb4 goddamnit
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> inb4 it A or B fight!
<otakon> Dark Crystal is B
<GabeMoist> dat SuperBrony64
<otakon> it IS B
<otakon> it's a cult classic
<Meanwhile> It sounds like a B. Since I've never heard of it.
<Kammerjunk> ...I forgot the actual glass.
<Sumica> 00,10good thing we have the longer intermition now for the way we like to debate things eh?
<Shizuka> 13that is also why i made it twice as long as the previous intermission
<otakon> It is a B
<Dovahkiin> 1,11Staurn: It is totally an A movie. High budget, high gross, lots of people who loved it.
*Ghosties is checking Rotten Tomatoes
<Shizuka> 13so much debate lately over A or B
<Ghosties> 04Indeed, good thing to have this
<Shizuka> 13because ponies keep picking bad
<Saturn> 08,01Dovahkiin: fair do's
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Funny we've never heard of it.
<Bjornfot> dem bees
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What did I miss? O.O
<otakon> God what was the deal last week?
<Sumica> 00,10we?
<Shizuka> 13richfiles is the user that kept whining about us to EQD... and yet here he is
<Sumica> 00,10Speak for your self i love it
<Meanwhile> A and B need some more defined parameters.
<Saturn> 08,01SuperBrony64: Dark Crystal!
<IshFrustratedPony> I dunno, Dark Crystal seems more like a cult film
<otakon> Indeed
<otakon> IshFrustratedPony: it is
<EspyLacopa> No, so much debate over A or B because there is no concrete definition of the two that everyone can agree to.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dark Crystal?
<Ghosties> 04Jim Hensen does Tolkien with the movie?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I heard of it
<Ghosties> 04Interdad
<otakon> It was not very well known when it was first released
<GabeMoist> Shizuka, who was doing what?
<Ghosties> 04Eh, could be our A
<Sumica> 00,10ok so while they debate it lets move on
<otakon> richfiles?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka why was he whinning ? or about what ?
<Meanwhile> Mfw it says the name in her post and people still ask...
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Doesn't have the muppets in it...
<Dovahkiin> 1,11It's Jim Hensen! How can it NOT be an A movie?!
<Shizuka> 13remember when we first started locking side rooms during the week
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah, it's got a big budget it made it's money back and received Decent reviews.
<Shizuka> 13he was raising all kinds of hell in EQD comments
<Ghosties> 04Was Labyrinth A?
<otakon> oh yeah
<Saturn> 08,01^
<Meanwhile> I don't read EQD comments. What was his beef?
<Shizuka> 13there were other things he would bitch about too but i forget
<Tovler> what's the A B fight over?
<otakon> well I think that kind of went over like a lead ballon at first anyway
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> people read EQD comments ?
<GabeMoist> I haven't gone to EqD in months, so no I don't remember
<otakon> Tovler: Dark Crystal tonight
<Shizuka> 13labyrinth was our B just before thanksgiving
<Tovler> Dark Crystal is B, next
<IshFrustratedPony> You remind me of the babe...wait wrong movie
<Dovahkiin> 1,11It qualified for B due to its cult following.
<otakon> IshFrustratedPony: Labyrinth GREAT MOVIE but still a B
<Shizuka> 13see ponies, this is why intermission 2.0 is 20 minutes long
<Ghosties> 04Ah, okay
<fluttercry> 05,15Dat thinking ahead
<otakon> Awesome, Gondor is a snowglobe
<Shizuka> 13to accomodate mod debates like this one!
<SlurryMoon> 3this could qualify for both A and B honestly
<otakon> with DERPY!
<Dovahkiin> 1,11Back when we had that as our requirment for B. Not sure if you all changed it or not.
<Sumica> 00,10I predict a reroll 132 Littlepip with MLP g1 movie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01For B.
<Meanwhile> G1 movie!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<SlurryMoon> 3really?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I think you could just leave it as an A Movie choice.
<fluttercry> 05,15I...think it's elligable again
<Meanwhile> YES!
<SlurryMoon> 3we just watched that
<Saturn> 08,01reroll, because it's not eligible yet?

<Bjornfot> the MLP movie was the only time i won the lottery :3
<otakon> Meanwhile: if it was octaviaspride you'd have a shit fit.
<Ghosties> 04You're a rainbow in the dark~
<fluttercry> 05,15Wait, he's right we did watch it for an event.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This is almost as bad as walking around in the Blockbuster with a two for one coupon and can't decide on the second movie.
<Meanwhile> That'd be different.
<fluttercry> 05,15THAT MEANS IT'S INELLIGABLE!
<Ghosties> 04...really?
<Ghosties> 04Loophole?
<SlurryMoon> 3yeah
<Saturn> 08,01wait, which event?
<otakon> no it wouldn't
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ofc not, it's only for movies played during BMN.
<SlurryMoon> 3it was an unofficial stream for something
<otakon> it would be "Deal w/it" territory
<Tovler> Bronystate 2.0 event?
<SlurryMoon> 3I think it had to do with Lulu
<Meanwhile> Yeah it would, it would've been Octavias_Pride
<IshFrustratedPony> but SuperBrony64, blockbuster no longer exists
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The 6 month rule is for ONLY BMN
<Shizuka> 13ohhhhh jaja
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We watched it during our anniversary I think.
<Shizuka> 13we did play for luna
<otakon> NO NO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or something.
<Ghosties> 04So was that her movie for the anniversary?
<Meanwhile> And Octavias_Pride isn't allowed to win anymore by international law of go-screw-yourself.
<Ictiv> If the White House's War Room was real, even it wouldn't have the amount of critical debate going on here about movies every week :D
<otakon> the goddamn rule counts
<otakon> WE SHOWED IT
<Shizuka> 13see why i made it longer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or it was during season finale week.
<otakon> it doesn't show again
<Tovler> Since Wrek plays movies all the damn time now...
<Shizuka> 13by now the normal intermission would be over
<otakon> you know how I knwo?
<Dovahkiin> 1,11No Derpy. Muffins aren't an instrument.
<SlurryMoon> 3yeah, Nitt's right
<Saturn> 08,01but that wasn't BMN, so it doesn't count, surely?
<GabeMoist> We haven't even decided the first movie yet
<Meanwhile> Indeed. Really for the best.
<SlurryMoon> 3so that was April
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 call of hax 40 Me with flash gordon.
<otakon> bc MY moive was passed over bc it was goddamn shown during an event
<Saturn> 08,01or is an executive decision being made?
<GabeMoist> Good grief
<Shizuka> 13also regs are special, regs get the youtube version: http://youtu.be/zmBlxzbLj5s
<Nittany_Discord> 11,016-month rule is for BMN and anniversary week.
<SlurryMoon> 3It's a Reroll guys
<Ghosties> 04I'd say any official stream counts, but that's just me
<otakon> and that is going in my favs
<GabeMoist> Yay~
<Meanwhile> Faved.
<IshFrustratedPony> so much jimmy rustling
<Saturn> 08,01well, you're presumably in charge, Ghosties :P
<SlurryMoon> 3it was an event, and it was in fact official
<SlurryMoon> 3so, I say reroll
<Meanwhile> Dat Freaky Fred.
<Kammerjunk> Aww, you so kind, Shizu.
<Dovahkiin> 1,11^
<otakon> yeah damn straight
*otakon hugs Shizuka "You are awesome"
<Saturn> 08,01but... i was kinda looking forward to it...
<Ghosties> 04I dunno
<Ghosties> 04I mean...ugh
<Ghosties> 04Just look at that
<Meanwhile> Too bad you aren't a girl otakon, then you might get a hug back.
<Ghosties> 04On the screen
<Ghosties> 04...christ
<Bjornfot> yay~
<Dovahkiin> 1,11*looks at Intermission vid* ironic
*Bjornfot huggles Shizuka
*Ghosties shudders
<RAWRity> worst part of intermission: watching the mods slowwwwllllllyyyyyyyyyy come to a decision on anything.
<Meanwhile> Ikr.
<otakon> RAWRity: lol
<Tovler> I knew I should have skipped the lottery ;-; so much fail.
<Ghosties> 04As...bad as it is, I say stick with it
<otakon> So, reroll on A and B?
<otakon> or just A
<Meanwhile> Woah that's a full fail, all the way. Double fail, ohmigod
<Shizuka> 13worry not ponies... i am as frustrated as you
<SlurryMoon> 3no Ty, we just went over that
<Ghosties> 04If it's BMN eligible, then stick with it
<otakon> and put Dark Crystal as B?
<GabeMoist> otakon, we've gotten no where
<Shizuka> 13i am just here to watch reactions und go back to busting street racers
<SlurryMoon> 3it's not because we just streamed it a few months ago
<Dovahkiin> 1,11But it's not BMN eligible.
<RAWRity> this is why shizu had to make the Intermission vid 20 mins
<SlurryMoon> 3for an official stream
<Tovler> but seriously Dark Crystal is B.
<SlurryMoon> 3it took place of BMN
<Wrek> 05hence forth reroll
<otakon> yes it is
<Dovahkiin> 1,11What was the reroll?
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: Yeah, she said that, like 4 minutes ago.
<fluttercry> 05,15looks like we might even exhaust this one
<ArcherJoe11> what did I miss?
<otakon> an awesome B
<Ghosties> 04Ah, then why were we waiting for me?
<Wrek> 05lets get goign or well have to extend the itnermission with another 10 minutes
<GabeMoist> I nominate the mod lottery debates for B Movie
<IshFrustratedPony> will we ever reach a decision?
<SlurryMoon> 3because your'e the boss man
<SlurryMoon> 3anyway, let's reroll
<otakon> fluttercry: Do Dark Crystal as B and just goddamn reroll A
<Meanwhile> No.
<Ghosties> 04...soooo
<Meanwhile> Never.
<Dovahkiin> 1,11Reroll. Tell.
<Ghosties> 04Why wait for me?
<Kammerjunk> GabeMoist: WMC
<otakon> fluttercry: Dark Crystal B, Reroll A!
<RisingPretender> 0,14GabeMoist, that gets WMC
<RAWRity> just. bucking. rerol.
<Ghosties> 04If it's not eligible for BMN then...
<Ghosties> 04OH GOD DERPY
<Meanwhile> There will never be a decision because there aren't enough bloody guidelines.
<RisingPretender> 0,14before we show it
<Saturn> 08,01"A and B movies must wait six months before being eligible for vote in the Lottery again; this is noted on our list of past movies."
<ArcherJoe11> We are all High Roller
<Saturn> 08,01was the non-BMN stream of it on the backlog?
<RAWRity> just reroll.
<Meanwhile> There isn't enough stuff in place to avoid this shit.
<Sumica> 00,10yfw I rerolled 5 min ago and you ingnored it
<RAWRity> Iz not hard decision.
<GabeMoist> *Monty Python GET ON WITH IT*
<SlurryMoon> 3tell us again Sumi
<Shizuka> 13which is the spreadsheet, though i haven't been keeping up with our non movie night events on that
<otakon> not it's not
<otakon> HELL JUST SWITCH THEM OUT
<Wrek> 05i thought you were joking sumi<3
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 call of hax 40 Me with flash gordon.
<otakon> Dark Crystal, B
<otakon> REROLL A
<Ictiv> Shizuka: This is just an idea, but when a third wants to keep, a third wants to reroll and a third is undecided, why not set the roller to binary and basically flip a coin? 1: Keep it, 2: Reroll?
<Shizuka> 13haaaaaax
<Shizuka> 13SHIP IT what's our pony eps
<Wrek> 05the hAAX
<fluttercry> 05,15Flash! AHHH HE SAVED EVERYONE OF US
<RAWRity> there. we gots a reroll.
<Saturn> 08,01...
<Meanwhile> Why not just figure out the goddamn rules for the movies better.
<RAWRity> now lets boogie on down.
<Gru> 8,6ok, now get on with the rolls for pony episodes
<Shizuka> 13no one agrees
<Saturn> 08,01by our rules, if it's not in the backlog, it is eligible
<Kammerjunk> God, why is Civ III music so good.
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: Do they ever?
<otakon> wait waht happened?
<IshFrustratedPony> Flash,ooooooooooooo, master of the universe
<Meanwhile> So take charge and slap everymod else in the face.
<Dovahkiin> 1,11A Movie: Dark Crystal. B Movie: Flash Gordan (ironically, I saw Ted durring my break, which features Flash.)
<fluttercry> 05,15Every few months we try and decide A and B guidelines...
<otakon> Shizuka: TAKE CHARGE!
<Sumica> 00,10Damn you baconmane with your reroll votes
<Shizuka> 13oh believe me... i try...
<Saturn> 08,01but but ponies!
<Kammerjunk> I think a universal rule of humankind is that humans can never agree.
<Meanwhile> Right, so it's an eternal slapfest.
<otakon> well it was worth a shot
<Meanwhile> You know what, you should let us do it.
<otakon> GODDAMMIT IF ONLY I WAS A MOD
<DJNilla> 06Onto pony episodes? c:
<RisingPretender> 0,14Kammerjunk, i disagree
<Kammerjunk> RisingPretender: o u
<Dovahkiin> 1,11Onto pony eps
<Sumica> 00,10Whiteheart 91 with The Show Stoppers
<otakon> Seriously, just change the order
<Meanwhile> otakon: You have more obligations to fulfill than moderating.
<RAWRity> oh hey, CMC episode
<Wrek> 05btw sumi: was it the 1936, 1980 version or what?
<otakon> Dark Crystal, B and then reroll A
<otakon> Meanwhile: like what?
<ArcherJoe11> I vote for the same Ep
*Saturn 08,01grumbles and flicks smooze goo at everyone
<Meanwhile> otakon: Like the fact that you're living with relatives?
<EspyLacopa> So, I missed it, what movies are on for next week?
<Meanwhile> No offense, obviously, but priorities man.
<RisingPretender> 0,14no one knows,
<RisingPretender> 0,14EspyLacopa
<otakon> Meanwhile: you're point? I wouldn't mod all the time
<Ghosties> 04Hey, CMC
<Ghosties> 04Excellent
<Meanwhile> otakon: ...sorry. Your*
<Tovler> I was under the impression that mods watched a good number of these movies.
<IshFrustratedPony> my water bottle is empty :(
<otakon> EspyLacopa: it's Dark Crystal for A and Flash Gordon for B
<Sumica> 00,1077 starflash with Season 2 A friend in deed
<otakon> after MUCH debate
<otakon> MUCH debate
<RAWRity> and Smile song. good eps.
<Bjornfot> Knytt... <3
<GabeMoist> We seriously made it?
<RisingPretender> 0,14fitting slide is fitting
<IshFrustratedPony> and I didn't win :(
<Kammerjunk> A friend with mead is a friend indeed.
<Meanwhile> Seriously, we should bring this whole A or B crap in here and let us do it.
<GabeMoist> I vote this lottery debate for WMC
<Kammerjunk> I tasted mead once. It is brilliant.
<Saturn> 08,01yay
<Kammerjunk> GabeMoist: I second this notion.
<Saturn> 08,01i love that episode!
<GabeMoist> If no agreement can be reached, it should be settled by a vote
<Saturn> 08,01>.>
<RAWRity> I've always been interested in trying mead, but alcohol ain't really my thing.
<Gru> 8,6A Movie: The Dark Crystal - richfiles
<Gru> 8,6B Movie: Flash Gordon - Sumica
<Gru> 8,6Pony 1: The Show Stoppers - Whiteheart
<Gru> 8,6Pony 2: A Friend in Deed - starflash
<IshFrustratedPony> Kammerjunk I need moar wenches and mead
<otakon> Goddammit I'm never going to win again.
<RisingPretender> 0,14I prefer resolutions to be done by Thunderdome
<Meanwhile> Or just take a list of the A movies and figure out an average from their scores.
<EspyLacopa> lol, buffering
<otakon> I got one win and then I was screwed over because they wanted to go by 31 day months
<Meanwhile> Really. Why can't you do that?
<RisingPretender> 0,14also, I've never won in my one year of being here ;__;
<Tovler> I'm never going to win at all.
<RAWRity> otakon: just have hope. I've won the lottery three times now.
<otakon> WHO THE HELL GOES BY A 31 DAY MONTH AS A STANDARD!?
<EspyLacopa> I won. . .a copy of Dota2.
<Saturn> 08,01awesome
*Saturn 08,01does a little dance
<Dovahkiin> 1,11Saturn, going by your logic, we could be watching Star Wars today despite watching the series throughout the week. It just doesn't work. :/
<otakon> EspyLacopa: isn't that free though?
<Meanwhile> RisingPretender: I've been here since the third movie night and I have won one pony episode. Don't you dare have the nerve to complain.
<Ghosties> 04That's it for this week's lotto, everyone!
<Ghosties> 04Enjoy the last two minutes of intermission
<Saturn> 08,01Dovahkiin: i suppose
<EspyLacopa> No idea, Otakon!
<RisingPretender> 0,14but I haven't won anything ;___;
<RisingPretender> 0,14ever ;__;
<GabeMoist> Meanwhile, you still won something
<Tovler> At least people have stopped picking random movies at imdb's bottom 100 for B.
<EspyLacopa> I do know, however, that I've never really played it.
<otakon> yeah
<RAWRity> First was when I got the free drawing from Wrek, next was pony ep with Sisterhooves Social, and third was B movie for Wicker Man original
<SlurryMoon> 3-m?
<Saturn> 08,01-m.
<Dovahkiin> 1,11-m
<otakon> you lucky bastard
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when nice job Shizuka?
<EggWhite> Quack!
<AttacktheAndalite> inb4 Meanwhile makes a "Where was Gondor when _________?" joke
<xxMoopyxx> you know i like it how it shows the bronystate intermission thing
<EspyLacopa> In the end, from when I did try it. . .I -loathed- the interface it used.
<MrBen> And here I thought 20 minutes wouldn't be enough of an intermission. What with the mods bickering and all.
<Tassadork> my childhood had too much asterix for this not to be awesome
*Spectrum_Rush| hugs Shizuka , intermission is awesome
<red_ony> sooo.. did I get this right..the B movie was streamed sometime before..outside the movie night...so without having been voted on like we just did? (/=/voted again) And that is why it is not eligible? Or it might be you just didn't like some pony's movie choice. :(
<Wrek> 05inby firstfoal

<Pudge> this chat just exploded
<K_A> richfiles: Thank you! I've been pushing DC for months!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon dota is free but you need a beta invite right now
*CupcakeExtreme01 turns off Mom's cell phone
<inkBot> love flash gordon. awesome movie
<MoonBiscuit> moinecraft
<otakon> it's free
<otakon> but you need an invite
<otakon> odd
*Ponies47 TUrns on his cell phone and sets his ringer to high
<AttacktheAndalite> Meanwhile: FUCK YEA I'M RIGHT
<red_ony> I'd be pissed if I had voted the first B movie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon it still in beta
<K_A> BTW, yes it is what I would call an A movie. But then my B movie choice was a Sun Ra flick, so my standards for B are probably tougher.
<Tovler> Stupid reroll. I've afraid to pick ambiguous A/B movies because of this new reroll thing.
<otakon> richfiles: you do realize that DC is a B movie right?
<Meanwhile> AttacktheAndalite: Yeah, but I was before you. ;P
<richfiles> No prob... Did the survey during the CLOSING CREDITS of the A movie too! :D
<Marx> Alright, Time's up! Let's do this!
<WalkerPony89> I sure do love buffering
<K_A> otakon: Wrong.
<Mersander> ahhhhhh :D

<twi_sprinkler_GS17> ehm: :$
<otakon> richfiles did the survey at the LAST POSSIBLE MINUTE
<Michael> childhood
<CupcakeExtreme01> lawlz
<pony_300> one heck of an intermission. Too entertaining, I had to pay attention and crap!
<WalkerPony89> Would Downfall be an A or B movie? It might be A movie style, but it had a shoestring budget
<richfiles> Pttthhhhht Dark Crystal was a HUGE movie... it is just created differently
<otakon> goddammit
<Dr_Fumbles> Um...... what?
<ZappyTheUnicorn> This brings back memories... :)
<Unnr> Woah, they actualy found it?
<Ghosties> 04Welcome to wacky world, nyuck nyuck!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and i already saw this movie... i'll be downloading guild wars
<Mersander> old moooovie time :D
<FlaschenJoe11> Hello Childhood
<otakon> WalkerPony89: what is Downfall?
<Buytoast> kill me
<xxMoopyxx> Heh i like how the ponies sit in front row center
<Buytoast> please
<IshFrustratedPony> is this animated or not animated?
<Jigglysaint> what movie is this?
<otakon> animated
<K_A> richfiles: Exactly. A movie doesn't have to be popular to be A.
<Jigglysaint> oh
<Firelight> What... the..
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it's animated as far as i can remember
<RosePetal> Asterix?
<Ghosties> 04The wacky twelve tasks
<otakon> it's based off of a French comic
<Griffon_Major> Ghosties: Three Stooges much? :P
<fluttercry> 05,15Downfall is the movie about Hitler isn't it?
<pony_300> also goddamn advert decides to pop up AFTER intermission is over >_<
<Zawan> intermission was great
<kidzrul434> i wanna be a pie!
<hen3ry> 1976.
<RAWRity> oh, asterix
<Jigglysaint> wait, Asterix?
<EspyLacopa> This is gonna be good.
<Azuredragon> wat is this?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> fluttercry it's
<XylemTube> i could't read the copy right :(
<richfiles> Dark Crystal has a huge following too!
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: do you have any extra keys
<Michael> asterix and obelix :D
<Meanwhile> Really, this fudge wouldn't happen if the A and B movies were more defined. Think of all the time you could spend getting drinks during the intermission that wasn't spent on figuring out whether to reroll or not.
<RAWRity> learned about that lil fucker in French classes.
<inkBot> sweeeet
<Kammerjunk> fluttercry: Ja.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i been voting that and schlinder list
<Ictiv> otakon: You know those "Hitler..." videos with that dramatic scene of Hitler yelling? That's from Downfall. It's a film about... Well, his Downfall
<FlaschenJoe11> This is my Childhood. Back when most Children Movies were Funny and smart
<Jigglysaint> okay somebody's French
<RAWRity> This tiny viking can go eat a dick.

<otakon> it's not even in FRENCH!
<Crippler> ohhhhh

<Shamroc> Ghosties: i could send you my box set of them..

<Meanwhile> otakon: would you?
<Firelight> Like a boss?
<Ghosties> 04So is this basically a Monty Python movie?

<JESmith71> Although the Asterix comics and graphic novels can be found at Barnes and Noble. I saw some of them there today
<RosePetal> Ah, I see they must to twelve tasks.
<Kandarihu> I just want to try to enjoy this movie without my country (which has nothing to do with this movie in any way shape or form) from being constantly bashed and hated on.
<Calcos323> Hercules is from Greek mythology, not Roman. The creators of this fukd up
<OohShiny> Operatorpony, Zeus turned Hercules a god
<Whiskra> Asterix is highly cultural content... perhaps not for americans, but it sure is for Europeeans
<mitamaking> Get on the hydra's back
<pony_300> also ceasar's logic is rather retarded here
<Kammerjunk> Ictiv: Shoot.
<Vordox> Whiskra: Hehe <3
<otakon> Kandarihu: what is you're country again?
<OohShiny> Calcos323 Hercules is roman
<infernap12> Runtime: 1:18
<OohShiny> Herakles is Greek
<Kandarihu> otakon, American.
<Meanwhile> Well.
<OohShiny> they are the same
<Operatorpony> Thesius from Hades?
<Marx> I believe that's all accurate.
<Calcos323> OohShiny: ...really?
<Jigglysaint> Fluttershy could do them all
<OohShiny> just changed name
<Dermathil> OohShiny: indeed. Heracles is the Greek name.
<Ictiv> I was thinking that watching a French film, you might be reminded of a very specific Spy...
<RosePetal> What if some the creatures don't exist?
<otakon> Kandarihu: dude it's not bashing the US where is it bashing it?
<Saturn> 08,01Calcos323: that's not true
<red_ony> havent seen any american bashing..
<Phase4> 00,02oh shit

<Rainbow_Glasses> Leafin the dream
<Azuredragon> FLUTTERTREE!!
<Dovahkiin> 1,11Fluttershy is a tree. The transformation is complete
<RAWRity> 5/10. Some rather entertaining bits, but the characters were rather unengaging, slapstick was somewhat awkwardly paced and choreographed (though that was more because of the animation limitations at the time), and the story itself had no real stakes or conflict.
<Tovler> Derpy Speaks! She's canon!!
<GabeMoist> So Yahooz
<crazypony> fluttertree
<Ghosties> 04Dat reference
<pony_5682> Ninjashy

<dinky> BIG ADVENTURE
<herostar_Discorded> i used to wonder what friendship could be
<owloysius> how can a tree help?
<Phase4> 00,02Scoot-Scootaloo, dats you?
<GabeMoist> What?
<OohShiny> Fluttershy evolves, FLUTTERSHY IS NOW A TREE
<BlazeAngel> The theme is the most shameful part to me, but, IM PROUD TO BE A BRONY DAMNIT!

<GabeMoist> Yahooz, Nice boat
<durger> how was the B movie?
<Yahooz> ^was
<SpadeMagnes[R]> OohShiny: Fluttershy wants to learn mimic but she can only learn 4 moves
<SirGanjalf> FRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCE
<otakon> Yahooz: why the busted boat?
<herostar_Discorded> FRIEEEEEEEENDS <3
<JESmith71> Due to dang hackers

<SirGanjalf> Fallout: Equestria!
<Dermathil> otakon: something hit it, what else
<Golden> another old movie:|
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hail pegasi.

<Yahooz> otakon: because thats what happens when you sail in intense conditions
<otakon> well DUH
<Lil_B> bye everyone, that it for me :)
<Calcos323> Hey, Equestria has film? I'm gonna have to show them Lawrence of Arabia!
<fapplebloom> electricity is now canon?
<Spectrum_Rush|> Scoot-Scootaloo: knew it was you the second i saw its ful animation :D so MLG
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe 10% downloaded this will take a while
<RAWRity> Movie also got rather repetitive at times. How many times can we watch Asterix and his friend bumble through a supposedly difficult task through dumb luck and brute strength before it gets old? 3 is the answer.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Gimmie dat Fallout!
<OohShiny> and 50s wiki movie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Evaporation?
<TheDoctor> everyone do the electric scootalooo
<Griffon_Major> TECHNOLOGY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
<otakon> but I mean when and how.
<Operatorpony> i like all the charcter designs this episode, and so many offically named Ponies!
<Rainbow_Glasses> Tornados and you
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why doesnt Ponyville have plumbing?
<SteveCharb> they don't just bring it up in buckets, that would be too practical!
<SirGanjalf> Weather. Weather never changes... wait.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Why yes, it is MLG~
<Yahooz> i could explain it but you would not understand a single word
<otakon> RAWRity: you are hard to please you know that?
<Yahooz> too much sailing lingo
<RAWRity> Yahooz: did you call upon the sea ponies
<GabeMoist> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, what you downloadin?
<OohShiny> TORNADO POWER! The magazine to the Tornado Console
<SirGanjalf> Vault-Pony!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> guild wars beta
<Fou_Lou> SpadeMagnes[R]: why should it?
<Dermathil> RAWRity: one second I need to find the total number of comics there is.
<BlazeAngel> WHAT 800? THERES NO WAY THAT CAN BE RIGHT!!
<RAWRity> otakon: hard to please? perhaps. Bored by monotony? Most definitely
<Nyria> Remember to buy a spot in a vault near you~
<Sumica> 00,10suppose i should put your animation on for a bit Scoot-Scootaloo
<Darf14> Spike accidentally the film

<Yahooz> RAWRity: ...i wouldve had it sunk
<Crippler> do ho
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fou_Lou: Because it would be sane?
<Rookeealding> you know, this is all just exposition... and they tricked us into watching it.
<SirGanjalf> dohoho
<Dermathil> There were 34 comic books as of 2009
<Spell-of-Gaming> INTERMISSION
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Aww yeah!
<otakon> RAWRity: well what movie did you like the most then?

<TheDoctor> but never ever wonder where ranibws come frm
<Riders> I'm out. See ya next week BronyState
<Yahooz> which it almost did
<JESmith71> Thankfully Spike didn't break the stream like the first time

<SpadeMagnes[R]> I mean how do they pump there...buisness
*Lone_Lycan pauses Andromeda to watch pony

<VenHur96> Hi everypony!

<otakon> she can only do stuff in EMEREGENCIES
<otakon> Calcos323: did you hear that?
<OohShiny> in the return of the harmony part 2, she reached rainbow dash
<Bjornfot> Dash doesn't care.

<Jigglysaint> Fluttershy Is Emmy
<Kurra> hrm.
<_Dan> le heartbreak
<otakon> and then she spoke Badger
<soul> HONEY BADGER
<RAWRity> Honey badger apparently DOES give a fuck 'bout Fluttershy
<Dovahkiin> 1,11Honey badger don't give a shit.
<Rookeealding> The emmy's are a joke.
<fapplebloom> so fluttershy is basically dr. dolittle?

<OohShiny> she flies really fast in return of the harmony, what's the problem anyway?
<Staticcloud> Derpy mask y u no have derpy eyes!
<VenHur96> EYE OF THE STARE MASTER!
<Operatorpony> Angel stole RDs hat
<otakon> therefore, I base it off of that.

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Angel actualy being nice to Fluttershy? What shit is this?

<otakon> Nyria: Scoot-Scootaloo's OC
<_Dan> EPIC MUSIC TIME
<Rookeealding> I think Angel is bipolar
<otakon> dem wing ups
<Calcos323> Sucking in the tears like that can't be good for you
<Bronysith> seems legit
<SteveCharb> Angel Bunny really does love fluttershy :$
<Phase4> 00,02Nyria, Scoot-Scootaloo
<Squallken> Money shot right there
<Nyst> That tear going back in still creeps me out.
<XylemTube> THERES NO EASY WAY OUT! THERE'S NO SHORTCUT HOME!

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yes you do
<Jigglysaint> it's like a tea party with rockets

<Rainbow_Glasses> yaay
<Pale_Horse> We need Kronk here. HE can speak squirrel!
<OohShiny> try again!
<hen3ry> you kinda sound like you do, Twi.
<Bronysith> RAWRity: dat interspecies
<JESmith71> PPG Tara Strong reference?
<fapplebloom> good job fluttershy but you still SUCK
<otakon> Fluttershy with her ENTOURAGE
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Funny thing is Tara voiced Bubbles WHO spoke it
<Rookeealding> My animals will eat you if you make fun of me again!
<OohShiny> dun dun duN!
<XylemTube> highway to the danger zone
<JESmith71> Or another one of Tara's characters
<Appleshine> ...

<otakon> over .5
<Staticcloud> SHE SUCKED UP A BUCKING TEAR!
<Dovahkiin> 1,11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Twilight's VO also voiced Bubbles, who COULD speak to squirrels.
<soul> :'(
<XylemTube> :[
<Calcos323> 1.21
<IshBestPonix> but wait, what about that time when she caught up to discorded dash, what happened to that
<OohShiny> she got 4 times faster!
<otakon> it's still a 400% improvement
<RAWRity> Fluttershy, you nearly quintupled your speed. YOu're fucking awesome.
<otakon> in less than a week
<Squallken> she got her there
<soul> lol irony
<OohShiny> tomorrow she'll get 10!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dovahkiin: think the joke was intentional?
<Darf14> Dang it Spike!
<VenHur96> Gonna' take you right in-to the, danger zooone. (love dat song)
<OohShiny> 4 faster
<Rookeealding> too much math for the kiddies
<RAWRity> not to mention you did it in a single afternoon
<SirGanjalf> STFU Spike!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Go Spike.
<Nyst> Zip it.
<otakon> GODDAMMIT SPIKE
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01:p
<RainbowAsh> IshBestPonix, at that time RD was carrying two ponies
<bob> twilight is going to kill spike @_@
<ROHKARA> And this is why Spike is an unlikable character
<fapplebloom> FUCK OFF SPIKE NOPONY LIKES YOU
<SteveCharb> Dovahkiin: squeak squeak squeaker squeak squeak squeaken?
<VenHur96> Spike is best troll?
<XylemTube> Thats an improvement of at least 20%
<Rainbow_Glasses> SPIKE
<otakon> Fluttershy needs more confidence
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Spike always makes things worse
<TheDoctor> she faster then vavle
<Calcos323> Spike has no empathy. It's like he's autistis or something
*soul wants to kill spike now
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And Spitfire will DO NOTHING
<Rookeealding> I think spike acts like a little boy, Never really knows how to shut up
*fapplebloom kills Spike
<otakon> TheDoctor: Snails in molasses are faster than Valve.
<Bronysith> ikr
<Nyst> Spike is just a kid, kids tend to be blunt now knowing the damage they can do.
<bob> spike tries to be funny like everyone else
<JESmith71> Did you guys see that?
<GabeMoist> SpadeMagnes[R], Spitfire isn't supposed to do anything
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: she's only there to observe, not her job.
<TheDoctor> true
<OohShiny> fluttershy is ultra damn fast in return of the harmony really, what happened to that speed?
<Meanwhile> People are too mean to Spike.
<_Dan> thats a good point
<SteveCharb> Rookeealding: he's just a baby dragonnnn
<Azuredragon> FFS, SPITFIRE ISN'T SUPPOSE TO DO ANYTHING! JUST JUDGE!
*soul highfives fapplebloom
<JESmith71> One background pony had Derpy eyes there
<otakon> OohShiny: it's called EMERGENCY
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well they were clearly down alot and she just sits there
<VenHur96> Am I the only pony in the world that's feels sorry for all the hate on Spike?
<RAWRity> Feather Flu? Pony Pox? I smell a future plague episode of MLP
<Rainbow_Glasses> Pegasususus
<Meanwhile> Spitfire is a lazybones
<_Dan> spitfire!
<Bronysith> RAWRity: zombies?
<Pale_Horse> Can't they just push Cloudsdale closer to the ground? It'd probably be a lot easier to do. It's made of clouds. The whole city probably only weighs, like, 10 pounds. :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fuck just supervising THEY NEEDED HELP
<otakon> VenHur96: no but Spike can't keep his mouth shut at times
<TheKoreanBrony1354> DERPY
<RAWRity> I was thinking more Black Death
<Ghosties> 04I mean, don't help or anything Spitfire
<SteveCharb> cutie pox outbreak
<xxMoopyxx> Where is your soul fluttershy?
<Ghosties> 04Lazy, inconsiderate douche bag
<Meanwhile> This shit is meant to be all important to Cloudsdale and crap, but the Wonderbolt just sits there chewing cud.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> If I was sent to supervise and they needed help, I WOULD HELP
<Dovahkiin> 1,11Spitfire: I"m just here to supervise. Let them handle it.
<Spectrum_Rush|> RIII COLAAAA
<Tassadork> I know right
<otakon> Pale_Horse: if it isn't high enough they clouds won't stay together.
<Rookeealding> otakon neither can Rainbow Dash sometimes
<SteveCharb> would be hella scary actually
<GabeMoist> Ghosties, it's more of a contest
<Nyst> Spitfire is a ponyville inhabitant. If she helped it wouldn't count.
<RAWRity> we find out Cutie Pox is spread by Parasprites
<Pale_Horse> Bleh. >.>
<TheDoctor> nine
<Darf14> Lazy Spitfire
<OohShiny> flying bonbon!
<Staticcloud> I SAw BONBON wtf
<SirGanjalf> Pale_Horse: Yeah, why don't they take Cloudsdale and PUSH IT SOMEWHERE ELSE?
<JESmith71> Maybe Spitfire couldn't help because she's not from Ponyville?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> If I was supervising I would still help
<Ghosties> 04But isn't it necessary to get that water up there?
<otakon> HOLD ON SPIKE!
<otakon> FLY DUCK FLY!
<bob> spitfire "they look like they arent doing good.... yea ill just sit here"
<Dovahkiin> 1,11Nyst: at this point, it's not about the record, it's about actually getting the water up there.
<fapplebloom> LET GO SPIKE
<StrayPony> Spitfire is Union, and she dont move without a work order ...
<Ghosties> 04Soooo if it's looking like they can't do it on their own, shouldn't she forego the rules and help?
<_Dan> steroids pony!!!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dovahkiin: which makes Spitfire lazy
<Spectrum_Rush|> OohShiny: Staticcloud Bons Away friend of Skyra
<Staticcloud> o
<herostar_Discorded> NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<abrony> hello everypony :D
<otakon> THEY NEED 8.1 GIGAWATTS OF WING POWER!
<Darf14> Dash is now a tree
<VenHur96> Dashietree
<SirGanjalf> Fluttershy sounded a bit like a Portal turret here
<Calcos323> pout
<soul> now RD is a tree
<SirGanjalf> EyeScream
<killerpony7733> Armor piercing eyees
<hen3ry> so 8 sick pegasi makes the difference between the shot at 910+ and 790.
<owloysius> two fluttershys?
<Nyst> Dovahkiin: they haven't failed yet. I'm sure Spitfire and others would come help -after- Rainbow Dash gave up.
<SirGanjalf> dat pout
<Squallken> wow
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why not rely on evaporation?
<bob> were is the steriods pony @_@
<GabeMoist> Ghosties, it is, but they make it a bit of a competition, if it became an emergency, they would use more than just Ponyville
<OohShiny> YEAAAAAAAAAAH!
<RainbowAsh> Ghosties, this really isn't an emergency. If they can't get the water to cloudsdale, they will just pick another town.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yea dont help or anything Spitfire
<Bronysith> rainbdrops
<otakon> they need 8.1 GIGAWATTS OF WINGPOWER.
<Darf14> Here lied RD, she wend down flying
<abrony> i got baned for a while D:
<JESmith71> Exahusted Derpy
<Whiskra> people like to pull RD's tail a lot...
<TheDoctor> nine
<Bronysith> raindrops
<Squallken> such care dashie has for the others
<Darf14> *lies*
<ROHKARA> It might make Ponyville look bad if the Wonderbolts help
<bob> YAY THERE HE IS
<hen3ry> which means those 8 averaged 15 wingpower... which is just shy of Dash's starting number...
<Meanwhile> YEEAAAH
<dinky> Rainbow dash died later that day
<Whiskra> it's like some kind of RD trope
<StrayPony> If I'm going down, I'm taking all the pegasi with me!
<TheDoctor> nine
<AttacktheAndalite> YEAAAAH
<Phase4> 00,02Nittany_Discord, because....
<Nyst> Nittany-Discord: Equestria doesn't have that kind of natural weather.
<IshBestPonix> you see kids, when a stallion loves a mare, the stallion [censored for the protection of the innocence of youth] in the mare's [censored for the protection of the innocence of youth] and they keep on [censored for the protection of the innocence of youth] with a melon [censored for the protection of the innocence of youth] until the stallion [censored for the protection of the innocence of youth] and thats where bab
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Dont help or anything...
<Bronysith> so why is spitfire there again?
<Bronysith> just to watch?
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, but it does, everfree forrest
<BlazeAngel> Remember Nittany_Discord? Weather isnt natural there. THEY control it.
<Ghosties> 04Hasn't every other town already given their water?
<otakon> IshBestPonix: lol
<SteveCharb> if you count parasprites as locusts, it would be interesting to see Ponyville deal with the remainder of the Plagues of Egypt
<GabeMoist> yes
<Spectrum_Rush|> otakon: funny you say that , sine one of the pegasus looks like Doc
<Ponies47> IshBestPonix: XD
<otakon> Ghosties: yes
<RAWRity> and then Spitfire did nothing to help, despite this being a god damn necessary part of Equestria's water cycle
<Kurra> Darn drought! XD
<otakon> Spectrum_Rush|: lol
<SteveCharb> except for the last one obviously because it would be waaay too dark
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BlazeAngel: Pretty awesome.
<OohShiny> I think Spitfire is over 20 wing power
<Nyst> +Phase4: But only there.
<RAWRity> further proof that the wonderbolts are poop
<VenHur96> Hasbro called, they want a Guile's Theme on this scene.
<Crippler> and that is how babby is formed
<Bronysith> RAWRity: logic!
<OohShiny> as wonderbolts captain and all
<SpadeMagnes[R]> God I hate Spitefire
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They do have natural weather in that universe.
<Fou_Lou> Ghosties: nope. At least it wasnt mentioned
<_Dan> hen3ry: but you have to take into account that they probably go faster when theyre in the hurricane :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Supervising or not she should have helped
<BlazeAngel> BUFFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEER
<Phase4> 00,02i'm willing to suspend disbelife, i meen we're already asked to accept the ponys can create tornadoes
<Pale_Horse> Do it for the me who believes in you...
<OohShiny> where did dat come from?
<XylemTube> 2.3WP MUTHAFUCKAS
<SirGanjalf> For SHIRE!
<Meanwhile> True fact, the Wonderbolts are actually pretty crap.
<Bronysith> WHY DONT FLUTTERSHIES BIRD FRIENDS HELP!?
<RAWRity> Scumbag Spitfire
<JESmith71> Then Fluttershy would have learned nothing
<fapplebloom> if i was in WWII they'd call me Spitfire
<Rainbow_Glasses> FOR NARNIA
<Dovahkiin> 1,11I laughed at Angel Bunny.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Pegasus Bon Bon?
<VenHur96> Go Fluttershy!
<RAWRity> Bronysith: too tiny to do anything
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The shit?
<otakon> and Angel got what he deserved
<GabeMoist> RAWRity, they make it a competition, if it became an emergency they would probably help
<soul> i dislike angel
<pony_8535> YEAH
<otakon> most dislike Angel
<Sumica> 00,10nah baby ponies come from two rainbows
<Kurra> VTEC just kicked in yo

<RAWRity> they should make it a "This is necessary for the god damn health and natural welfare of our entire country, let's get this shit done."
<_Dan> see how she's pushed forward when she entered the twister? :) their wingpower is probably faster when theyre inside
<GabeMoist> RAWRity, it's not like if Ponyville were to not succeed, Equestria would suddenly end, they could just go somewhere else

<VenHur96> Suddenly, RAVE PARTY!
<Vordox> MY FAVOURITE YTMPVV!
<otakon> XD
<RAWRity> Dermathil: this isn't a competition. This is a necessary part of Equestria's functionality.
<Kencolt> Darf14: The HAY they can't. Farmers clip their wings to keep them grounded.
<Dovahkiin> 1,11lawl
<soul> YES :D
<Meanwhile> Competition was largely for funsies.
<otakon> MY EYES!
<Dermathil> Meanwhile, that's called LOGIC. I assume they are holding a tally of the strength of the pegasus population of each town.
<Phase4> 00,02wats dis
<OohShiny> no shipping thank you
<xxMoopyxx> what the hell
<Dovahkiin> 1,11o.o

<Lunchbox> I'm out. G'nite everypony.
<Firelight> My eyes are barfing out rainbows right now.
<_Dan> YEEEEEAAAAHHH
<fapplebloom> shipping and handling
<Vordox> BEST YTPMV! <3 EVEEEER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<VenHur96> Am I funny pony?
<TheDoctor> nine
<Vordox> inb4 Cock
<GabeMoist_> RAWRity, then why wouldn't they have a single task force made up of pegasi from each town to do it each time
<Meanwhile> Your logic is flawed. Do you want to count every pony in that tornado?
<Dovahkiin> 1,11And thus I must leave.
<OohShiny> cockadoo cockaddo
<otakon> a'wwwww
<Meanwhile> Seeya Silverscreen.
<AttacktheAndalite> NIght, Dovahkiin
<Shamroc> cya Dovahkiin!
<otakon> bye Dovahkiin sorry to see you go
<Shamroc> aka silver!
<Reikim> Evening, all.
<SteveCharb> GabeMoist: hmmm like a pegolympics?
<Dermathil> RAWRity: they're still counting the wingpower capable of being provided by the town. Spitfire participating would make the results irrelevant since it would then account for what both Ponyville + Spitfire can do.
<RAWRity> GabeMoist: tradition, most likely.
<TheDoctor> rest dragon born
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cya Dovahkiin
<herostar_Discorded> for little kids? show 'em this
<Pale_Horse> I'm gonna do an Internet! *Rainbows*/ Well, I'm gonna do a book! *Nothing* Aww... :(
<otakon> Dovahkiin: well you be back tomorrow?
<Spectrum_Rush|> bai Dovahkiin
<Sumica> 00,10have fun dragonborn
<BlazeAngel> Bye Dovahkiin.
<Ponies47> Bye Dovahkiin
<soul> alll the effects...... IM BLIND! O.O
<SteveCharb> GabeMoist: actually that's a real good idea
<hen3ry> and they call AJ the silly pony. Heh.
<Reikim> Evening, all. I hope we're all having a good night.
<TheDoctor> too much magic
<RAWRity> Dermathil: because knowing Ponyville's wingpower is more important than SUPPLYING WATER AND WEATHER TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY
<Meanwhile> You're acting like the contest was the more important factor.
<bob> @_@
<herostar_Discorded> booom!
<Sumica> 00,10this reminds me of another one that kills my bandwith
<Firelight> thedocter: Their is NEVER TOO MUCH MAGIC

<Spectrum_Rush|> dat +m abuse
<Marx> Anyway, I was gonna say that tonight was a good Movie Night.
<BlazeAngel> So, I guess movie night is over after the after show, also Im banned. :P
<bob> is this the new brainwashing program to get new bronies
<TheDoctor> it burns!!!
<SteveCharb> or even, why doesn't cloudsdale make its own friggin tornado?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yay
<Dermathil> RAWRity: seems like bureaucracy is indeed more important to some ponies.
<Capfluttershy> Hello Everypony!
<Firelight> Le' Gasp.
<Reikim> Meaningless and pointless arguments about the mechanics of a non-existant universe. I LIKE THIS.
<SteveCharb> pavlov bunny

<otakon> O_o
<Pale_Horse> >.>
<Dermathil> Reikim: I'd rather try to find a logical explaination than immediately grab the pitchfork everytime I see something that doesn't make sense within 5 seconds of seeing it (not everything is simple)
<RAWRity> GabeMoist: but there would be no need to assemble more pegasi if Spitfire had bothered to lift a damn feather
<bob> MOFO
<pony_5682> O.o Satanshy
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> look how hifgh i can jump

<Reikim> Conclusion: Spitfire is either a lazy jerkass or a magnificent bastard.
<SteveCharb> Reikim: philosophers have had arguments about the mechanics of non-existent universes since the dawn of time
<OohShiny> nice
<SirGanjalf> http://www.dramabutton.com/
<fapplebloom> dragons must be genocided or enslaved
<bob> only she can read it XD
<otakon> dat Pinkie
<RAWRity> Dermathil: except the explanations you offer would imply that Equestria's citizens are all idiots.
<VenHur96> Friendship is Witchcraft = Best Pony Parody that is not .MOVs
<BronyFromMalaysia> lol
<Cypresswolf> :) Waffles in a bounce house
<Reikim> SteveCharb: And how highly are they regarded nowadays?
<OohShiny> MONTAGE!
<RAWRity> so either all of Equestria is stupid, or Spitfire is poop
<otakon> dat music
<TheDoctor> no mentally advad is bettee
<SirGanjalf> WE NEED A MONTAGE
<Reikim> Actually
<Aryd> aww poor spike
<otakon> LOL
<SteveCharb> Reikim: socrates and plato and the like?
<Reikim> I have a wild crazy theory that could justify EVERYTHING.
<OohShiny> Appling HOOK!
<Meanwhile> Pitchfork sounds rather extreme. It's more like, basically, the country was in need of that stuff for the sake of, you know, normal function. And the gooseberry who could have ensured they didn't like, have a drought or something was sat on her ass in a jumpsuit.
<Dermathil> Rawrity: You're implying everyone's an idiot. Bureaucracy is idiotic. Not the citizenry.
<otakon> no one likes Spike
<Azuredragon> Nopony likes Spike
<JESmith71> Montage made even more awesome

<Reikim> Magnificent bastard Celestia
<fapplebloom> Cypresswolf: Hitler liked Spie
<Staticcloud> Poor Spike
<dinky> poor spike...
<pony_5682> why were AJ's and Rainbows Elements switched?
<bob> dislikes spike... seems ligit

<Reikim> ^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Mentally Advanced Series was my fav for a while.

<Fenr> club,spikes,clubbing spike
<otakon> Clubbing Spike
<Fenr> XD
<RAWRity> So yeah, I'll stick with my theory that the Wonderbolts are terrible at their jobs.
<BronyFromMalaysia> lol
<Dr_Fumbles> Sorry, but I always thought these were overrated... They're good, sure
<SteveCharb> lol alicorn sparkle
<VenHur96> Even Twilight hates Spike...
<Pale_Horse> DeceptiShy! Transform!
<SirGanjalf> Spike - element of loneliness
<Dermathil> I feel like the people in here are TRYING to make it make no sense.
<otakon> Fanfiction

<BronyFromMalaysia> DERP :derpy:
<Firelight> SEems legit.
<XylemTube> Sieg hiel
<Meanwhile> And I feel like you are trying to make it make sense.
<Reikim> Celestia manipulated every single event of that episode to help Fluttershy overcome her fear of failure.
<sonicandmario85> LOL
<VenHur96> I guess Spike must of hates himself for everyone hating on him.
<otakon> Princess Sparkle
<BronyFromMalaysia> :DH:
<Bronysith> Dermathil: that is the point
<Firelight> O_O
<SteveCharb> RAWRity: they're just overrated and overused

<SirGanjalf> dat balloon
<Sabershy> Yep SparklyWaffles
<JESmith71> SparklyWaffles one of Disney's best
<Reikim> That's why, COINCIDENTALLY, the EXACT number of ponies got sick to make Fluttershy's wingpower relevant.
<bob> yes it's good
<SteveCharb> SparklyWaffles: is the pope catholic?
<Fenr> :D
<SirGanjalf> http://www.dramabutton.com/

<Pale_Horse> Fluttershy has at least a dozen words of Dragon Shouts then. :D
<Meanwhile> Bronysith when will you get the hint that everyone in the whole world just wants you to stop talking? Really, it's remarkable.

<SteveCharb> Vordox: lawl abba is one of those "what were we thinking?" mistakes
<SirGanjalf> rainbow:P
<Meanwhile> Frankly I think he's a self entitled shitbag, but that's just my opinion.
<Tassadork> yep
<Firelight> HURR DURR
<Cypresswolf> I remember Abba - Sweddish sensation of the 90's couldnt go a week in jr high without hearing a song of theirs
<richfiles> The 1978 Japanese concert performance of "If It Wasn't For The Nights" is an awesome song... I still say it needs to be PMVd :$
<Vordox> SteveCharb: ...>.>
<OohShiny> It's her father!
<Randomiser> Spike is the only thing that can't dream.
<Pale_Horse> Yes. Spiders can so dream... They dream of creeping up the noses of other creatures and laying eggs in their brains. :P
<RAWRity> Like how some people seem to think that me criticising a movie on here means I think it's awful.
<Reikim> One of those people on the Internet who are convinced wholly and entirely that their opinion is the only valid one. Troll slang: TARGET.

<Reikim> Meanwhile: If you had mad tech skills like Shizu, you'd have a chance at tech mod. If you were artistic like Wrek, you'd have a shot at art mod. I don't think you have either (unless I'm wrong, truly sorry if I am, I'm new here) so that leaves chat mod.
<Capfluttershy> Sweetiebot is the the best pony

<Reikim> Meanwhile: This time I'm writing it from scratch. It's about Trixie and her son. I've somehow latched onto it, and now I'm dead-set on turning it into a massive spiritual journey for Trixie where she figures out who she is and what her goals really are.
<Thrackerzod> Fun fact : ILOVEYOU, is a highly affetice computer virus

<RAWRity> and it turns out your fic was actualy just a really long sequel to the one I wrote
<Reikim> But no, he wants to have stereotypical fuzzies combined with Trixie gaining powers from nowhere to fight another guy who gains godly powers because apparently Luna and Celestia sacrificed blood to get powers and argh

<oni_link> it
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It was fortold!
<RAWRity> SteveCharb: except Batman was all emo about it.
<Reikim> SteveCharb: Kenshin swore a vow never to kill anyone again. Thus, he uses a reverse-edged sword, and he actually keeps his word.
<Stallion_of_War> I rather liked the Sonic Scream power Firelight
<Bronysith> otakon: sonic is DEAD. he was replaced by his retarded cousin. the tall skinny green eyed freak
<otakon> pony_9001: it's Friendship is Witchcraft
<RaveBrony> :D
<Darf14> bye, going to watch MP After dark

<Firelight> YES! NEW IT!
<Firelight> LOOOL
<OohShiny> go song
<Bronysith> JESmith71: you get to play as sonic or his retarded cousin
<Reikim> Kenshin: Could have killed everyone in the blink of an eye. Didn't, and is more of a man than most Shonen heroes for it.
<soul> can you get desktop ponies on windows?
<crazypony> song time
<Firelight> The Fun Has been Doubled!
<otakon> WE NEED AN EXTENDED VERSION
<Vordox> Soul: YEs
<Bronysith> k

<VenHur96> SpadeMagnes[R]: Same here, I hates the whole green eyes arguement.
<abrony> best song
<Unnr|Laptop> soul, yes, yes you can
<SteveCharb> finer arts.
<oni_link> :D
<Reikim> Naruto and Bleach are nothing compared to Kenshin, imo
<RAWRity> easily the worst part of FiW is teh songs.
<otakon> Buytoast: um.....do you know where you are?
<abrony> smexy
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> sexual
<Buytoast> oh, i know
<soul> i cant seem to go to the website
<oni_link> lol nope
<VenHur96> otakon: We need extended version of THIS and Pinkie's Brew!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The people who whine about sonic with green eyes need to get off their nostalgia obsessions
<RAWRity> Ironic considering the shows in FiM are one of the major draws.
<SteveCharb> RAWRity: why would you post that :'(
<oni_link> damn right lol

<Djkilla299> YES!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dat Shinning Music
<Buytoast> doesn't mean i like the pony fandom
<otakon> WE GOT A TROLL
<Stallion_of_War> Impossible. Luna is also Alicorn of sexiness
<Bronysith> JESmith71: what?
<pony_9001> so pinkie is a satan worshipper? XD
<JESmith71> Never mind
<RAWRity> I'll post it when we get to the Gypsy bard episode.
<Vordox> Buytoast: Yeye, as long as you behave and not a twat =P
<oni_link> SpadeMagnes[R]: I dont mind but Sonic X is utter crap
<Djkilla299> This is epic
<abrony> i was framed
<otakon> pony_9001: no just a Gypsy
<SirGanjalf> More like the Old Ones worshipper
<cratorkid> pinkie is a gypsy pony_9001
<richfiles> Follower of the Smooze
<JESmith71> He was another guy who was against Modern Sonic but he's not around no more
<SpadeMagnes[R]> oni_link: eh never liked sonic x

<Bronysith> otakon: and a few other things i cant mention in chat...
<OohShiny> cherryjack
<SirGanjalf> cherry
<crazypony> dat cherryjack
<RAWRity> But yeah, Naruto at its best could MAYBE rival the middling arcs in Kenshin, but since its height, Naruto's been way too inconsistent.
<soul> can anypony tell me why IE cant display the desktop ponies webpage?
<oni_link> XylemTube: I never doubted that lol
<otakon> Bronysith: .................. why?
<Firelight> Peewee.
<richfiles> Peewee sack
<OohShiny> kiwijack
<SirGanjalf> kiwi
<SpadeMagnes[R]> soul: because IE sucks
<abrony> smexy
<SteveCharb> kiwisack
<Reikim> I lost track of Naruto after...hmmm...
<Sumica> 00,10cause IE sucks
<RAWRity> Bleach was, even at its absolute best, just a fun, shallow battle manga
<Firelight> Rat Swagger?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sumica: beat ya to it
<Reikim> That immortal guy.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> get Firefox
<otakon> soul: bc IE sucks the biggest amount of ass possible.
<Stallion_of_War> Why are the apples censored?
<Sumica> 00,10IE has one use.
<soul> anything other than that
<VenHur96> Soo...Chrome's better?
<Sumica> 00,10downloading firefox
<otakon> Stallion_of_War: Dole joke
<SteveCharb> neopet!!!
<otakon> VenHur96: Firefox
<Reikim> Bleach was never really much, mostly because the author wasn't planning at all.
<otakon> Sumica: lol
<SirGanjalf> spider.
<bob> hmm spider :P
<Firelight> The Fun Has Been Doubled!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Pumkin chunking
<richfiles> Censored apples are part of the satire of this episode.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What Sumica said.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> It's dead!
<Firelight> Lol
<RAWRity> now it's a nonsensical pos with the mangaka essentially throwing ideas at a wall and using what sticks.
<Azuredragon> http://lolbot.net/pix/21711.jpg
<oni_link> lol jeez, you guys should help the dude with his main concern about the desktop ponies :D
<VenHur96> otakon: Firefox's better than Chrome?
<soul> it isnt that bad -_-
<SirGanjalf> grape
<richfiles> making fun of the youtube takedowns and stuff liek SOPA, and such.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does anyone else watch that show where they build catapults and launch pumpkins?
<otakon> VenHur96: Chrome doesn't like this site too much.
<XylemTube> Buy some apples!
<Reikim> Bleach POTENTIALLY could have been good, if the implications of an afterlife and death and resurrection and Hell had been exploited.
<Firelight> Censored Apples.
<Vordox> uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: that's Pumpkin Chunkin and it's an event
<Vordox> LAWl
<OohShiny> lol
<SirGanjalf> cantalope

<FUS_RO_yay> Friendship is Witchcraft?
<Marx> :D
<JESmith71> Sublimenial messages
<SteveCharb> why have I seen these creatures in my nightmares?!?!?
<Sumica> 00,10it's more of the new flash dont like crome
<otakon> eeyup
<Reikim> Unfortunately, in a contemporary Shonen manga, it's not really realistic to expect that.
<Firelight> Umad Bro?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> MORE DOTS
<bob> i use interenet explorer cuz fire fox keeps freezing when i got on this site
<SirGanjalf> this is gold:D
<OohShiny> da song
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> my internet doesnt like chrome
<otakon> bob: odd it works fine for me
<OohShiny> stupid trolls
<pony_9001> why are apples censored exactly? XD
<VenHur96> Actually, my Chrome is working just fine with the stream, I'm not kidding.
<SteveCharb> I liked Ranma let's talk about that
<RAWRity> but instead it was basically "BANKAI! GETSUGA TENSHOU! SWORD FIIIIIIGGGHHHHHTTTTSSSSSSS!!!!!1111!!!!!ONE!"
<richfiles> Cencored apples are PART of the joke
<Reikim> Ha! I loved Ranma.
<FUS_RO_yay> VenHur96: Thats what im using.
<Firelight> Corn on the COb!!!!
<Spell-of-Gaming> pony_9001: Censor jokes
<otakon> the faults of the children
<OohShiny> lol
<XylemTube> isint season 3 comming?
<Vordox> awww validated
<Vordox> XD
<Sumica> 00,10cause Dole pony_9001
<RAWRity> Reikim: Or at least, in something like WSJ, a series that dark and contemplative wouldn't have a shot.
<richfiles> It's done intentionally to make fun of censorship and stupid laws forcing it.
<soul> if IE the problem, this is the first time it's done this
<otakon> BUY SOME APPLES
<SteveCharb> I like when he took advantage of his condition
<Reikim> Ranma is one of the few long-runner manga that I read all the way through.
<OohShiny> Jekyll HYDE!
<Petrified_Discord> DANCE PARTY!
<Quick_Thinker> mortal kombat FTW
<abrony> jackle high...
<Vordox> Dat OCtavia
<Vordox> :D
<oni_link> lol
<richfiles> BUY SOME CANTELOPES
<RAWRity> If it were running in a less mainstream mag, maybe it would have been different.
<Reikim> RAWRity: I remember they did something...something good, maybe.
<otakon> ah Ranma
<pony_9001> im going to have to go back and watch all these
<Quick_Thinker> i did too :C
<OohShiny> lol
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Luna is best princess
<otakon> Inu Yasha had potential
<Reikim> Ranma kind of lost momentum a bit at the end, and the ending annoyed the hell out of me, but otherwise I loved it to bits.
<SteveCharb> like when he did girly contests like ice skating or bikinis or whatever
<oni_link> dat viking pony :3 who was that btw?
<abrony> space camp
<Quick_Thinker> but then i remembered i suck at dancing
<otakon> but they NEVER GODDAMN ENDED IT IN THE ANIME
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not best princess? :p
<BaconMane> 0,5Night guys
<abrony> ssssad
<OohShiny> lol
<oni_link> good bye BaconMane
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> BaconMane: Dream of Ponies

<RaveBrony> Cya BaconMane!
<Spectrum_Rush|> nite BaconMane
<Vinco> Night, BaconMane
<SpadeMagnes[R]> BOO
<OohShiny> dat rhymes
<abrony> ooooooooooooo
<RAWRity> Bleh, I found inu yasha unintersting from the get go
<otakon> SteveCharb: some of the movies basically ran with that idea a lot.
<Firelight> lol
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> dead bird
<abrony> cencored apples
<RAWRity> One manga I do hope eventually gets an anime: Nisekoi
<VenHur96> Bye BaconMane.
<otakon> SteveCharb: Nihao My Concubine for one.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> May I ask why someone would build a random statue of NMM in the middle of the everfree forest?
<bob> these rymes are killng me @_@
<otakon> Nisekoi?
<SteveCharb> candy police + licorice rope
<Reikim> I liked Akane because she wasn't JUST a formulaic Tsundere, unlike Kagome. She was a strong person in her own right, just overshadowed by far greater martial artists, and tries to stand on her own despite that.
<otakon> Never heard of it.
<Vordox> VAMPIRES
<AttacktheAndalite> NIght, BaconMane
<Firelight> Vampires are always sexy.
<OohShiny> because Pinkie!
<otakon> exactly
<Firelight> EVen though I hate twilight....
<RAWRity> otakon: look it up, really charming and funny romance manga
<Firelight> Not the twilight on the show..
<abrony> why
<Firelight> the movie..
<otakon> romance
<abrony> oh
<otakon> ..............................
<Firelight> SIGh..
<abrony> good
<SteveCharb> Reikim: yeah! She was a good character
<Vordox> There's nore vampires in Twilight, s oit's fine Firelight
<pony_9001> butt fun jokes
<oni_link> we get it
<Azuredragon> lol
<OohShiny> Silly Butt Fun
<oni_link> lol
<RAWRity> well, romantic comedy is more appropriate
<Firelight> Twilight is my 3rd favorite pony.
<abrony> secret butt fun
<bob> that kid is awkward
<AttacktheAndalite> ALL the butt fun jokes!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> There is such a thing as over doing a joke
<otakon> eh, why not?
<SirGanjalf> not fun butt fun
<Reikim> RAWRity: Nisekoi? Hm. I dunno, romance really isn't up my alley right now. I just looked at the first volume of Future Diary, though, and I was moderately impressed.
<XylemTube> <3 russians
<RaveBrony> D:
<fapplebloom> butt fun is a euphemism for anal sex
<Firelight> LOL
<richfiles> Only Luna can bring sexy back! :$
<SirGanjalf> :D
<Sumica> 00,10and that's the joke SpadeMagnes[R]
<SteveCharb> lawl DT + SS
<RaveBrony> Dat pip
<otakon> Have ya ever read BioMeat?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Family guy drives jokes into the ground
<Reikim> Nah, never heard of it.
<otakon> Horror manga
<OohShiny> wut?
<otakon> good character growth
<Reikim> Ah, sorry. I don't really do much horror.
<OohShiny> ghouls and phantoms?
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[R]: you dont say
<SteveCharb> SpadeMagnes[R]: antihumor
<oni_link> I luv luna
<Firelight> What is up with the censored apples?
<Reikim> I prefer suspense as the darker end of what I read.
<bob> did she just have smaller wings for a sec there @_@
<Quick_Thinker> i could either watch ponies or mario after dark I CHOOSE PONIES
<Vinco> Most touching molestfest
<Marx> Well, I'm gonna try to go to bed and get up in the morning. Hopefully I'll see you guys then.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Firelight: because Dole
<abrony> toutching molest fest....
<Bronysith> Reikim: i hate gore fics...
<richfiles> Most touching molest fest yet... I C wat U did thar! :$
<OohShiny> ARGHAHRAHAHGHARA
<oni_link> Firelight: it was a joke in the begining
<RAWRity> Basically, these 2 teens, Raku and Chitoge, hate eachother. Their fathers are the leaders or rival Crime families that are on the verge of war. The fathers, being old friends, decide the only way to stop the bloodshed is to have Raku and Chitoge pretend to be in love, so as to get the 2 factions to call a cease fire
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Trippy
<abrony> dat screen
<Quick_Thinker> i could either watch ponies or mario after dark I CHOOSE PONIES
<Bronysith> id rather read clop or see r34 pics then read a gore fic Reikim
<Firelight> oni_link: ........oh.... HURR HURR HURR -.-
<AttacktheAndalite> Molest Fest...seems legit
<fapplebloom> i could either masturbate or watch ponies I CHOOSE BOTH
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Who the hell takes the candy they leave at the statue?
<abrony> tripy
<Reikim> RAWRity: Interesting. A bit of a mix between the old Romeo/Juliet plot and a tsundere romance.
<oni_link> do any of you know what the name of that viking pony was ? shes a background pony
<Shooeie> whats with the hate on spike
<OohShiny> fapplebloom eww man
<oni_link> Firelight: yep

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> sandman
<Sumica> 00,10play song slow it becomes scary
<Bronysith> night my fellow regulars
<otakon> Well, it deals with the outbreak of a organism known as BioMeat that was originally engineered to be a replacement foodsource and trash disposal. It eats EVERTHING except for glass and metal.
<OohShiny> this one
<abrony> bum bum bum
<Quick_Thinker> creepy
<RAWRity> sort of, yeah. It's got some great gags though.
<abrony> mr sand man
<SirGanjalf> O_o
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And how long have they been celebrating Nightmare night anyway?
<hen3ry> Mr. Sugarpony.
<MoonBiscuit> O_O

<abrony> man this is kinda creepy and i played amnesia
<RAWRity> But my all time fav manga would have to be Angel Densetsu
<OohShiny> portals
<Reikim> The old tsundere archetype is starting to wear on me, though. Is it really impossible for a girl and a guy to have a platonic relationship where they mutually jab at each other?
<crazypony> creepy
<Shooeie> creepy....
<otakon> no
<bob> TEH PORTAL
<VenHur96> Welp, i'm gonna has a good night tonight...

<abrony> mods are asleep
<pony_9001> This stream is brought to you by the letter E.
<XylemTube> .movs are fun :)

<abrony> EEEEEEE
<abrony> E
<kirzstryfe> 8,6the .movs require a... unique... sense of humor
<abrony> EEEEEEEEEE
<Firelight> .Movs are imature and inapropriate and only should be viewed only and inapropiate for kids like yourself.
<Phase4> 00,02KSP
<VenHur96> Stop spamming...
<OohShiny> I like shed.mov just because of the music
<Phase4> 00,020.16 WAS RELEASED
<OohShiny> it's just awesome
<SteveCharb> "It's twins, by the way, in case anyone was going to ask...... I'm gonna name them Snoopy and Prickly Pete"
<otakon> ofc there are stereotypes for a reason
<killerpony7733> Phase4: What's in the update???
<abrony> do the . movs anyeays
<RAWRity> Shounen titles are going after 12-15 year old guys, wo that's the main character they go with.
<Reikim> Excuse my vulgarity when I say fuck gender stereotypes.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Phase4: KSP?
<JESmith71> No

<bob> OMG
<JESmith71> These people new?
<crazypony> yay
<soul> can someone help me? i try to go to desktop ponies website and all it does is load a really long time and then say it cant display the webpage :'(
<RAWRity> meanwhile, Shoujo titles generally have female protagonists.
<otakon> JESmith71: more than likely yes
<bob> i need to buy that game T_T
<abrony> STAY OUT OF MY SHED
<otakon> soul: the site just might be down you know.

<richfiles> Raincloud... Always remember, nevar fergit.
<XAX> wrong.*
<Reikim> I know, but it still irritates me.
<RAWRity> and there are some really good shoujo titles out there, Ouran High School Host Club and Skip Beat being 2 I can name off the top of my head
<SteveCharb> Reikim: we're men watchin ponies. We're all very progressive here
*Mutterguy notes that counting to 4 in binary results in a rude guesture

<Firelight> NO DERPY?!?! :(
<SteveCharb> raincloud <3
<oni_link> that was a decent dashie if i say so myself
<Reikim> The reason I love stuff like Madoka and Nanoha is that the female leads were fairly responsible, self-sufficient girls who are capable of being great on their own.
<Sumica> 00,10what did they add?
<fapplebloom> who is this derpy you speak of?
<richfiles> Blast Corps... I could start a new game and play to the moon level in 54 minutes! :)
<soul> sensor parody?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why nanos?
<cratorkid> lol , dole
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Those things are fucking small
<Firelight> soul: Censor*
<RAWRity> Reikim: Read Claymore and Angel Densetsu
<OohShiny> lol
<Reikim> Also RAWRity, Ouran was kickass. Haruhi is one of my favourite protagonists, especially that ending scene.
<soul> sorry xD

<SpadeMagnes[R]> CTHULU
<JESmith71> kirzstryfe, what do you think of Jappleack then since it's in the other direction (Ditching the shock humor to tell a serious interesting story)
<RaveBrony> Lol! :D
<Reikim> Very nearly broke me into manly tears
<otakon> that one with the twins?
<Phase4> 00,02oni_link, yep
<Sumica> 00,10well then I guess you want to stream then Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02gota download it first

<otakon> So, should I get Fallout 3 GotY edition for 5 bucks?
<richfiles> YES
<cratorkid> yes
<Reikim> otakon: I'd recommend Ouran pretty highly. It's got pretty good gags, and the ending is incredibly heart-wrenching.
<adasdad> YEEES
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: they're just music players
<richfiles> YES, YES, YES :)
<killerpony7733> otakon: Five bucks please so bud,

<pony_9001> how long is that train XD
<killerpony7733> Phase4: Well must be relatively moderate considering you already on 6 or more %
<RAWRity> and then otakon smacked himself so hard he lost a tooth
<SirGanjalf> Stallion_of_War: Maybe cargo trains
<richfiles> Train is so long.... Just find and empty car and piss behind a seat... Won't be found for days
