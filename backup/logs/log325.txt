<jaydencurtis> She Derped your stream
<Winter_Shadowhooves> this show has shown me so much
<EatPinkPies> I was playing THe Ballad of Gay Tony the other day with anothe rBrony, and we were arguing on which would be better, The Ballad of Fluttershy, or The Ballad of Rainbow Dash.
<SASFalcon> DarkDemon, all I know is Tara Strong = Twilight Sparkle, Michelle Creber = Rarity (and Derpy)
<JowHoof> Mine was excellent :D
<P0n-3> Hey! Have all of you bronies heard of the Ponkart game in the works?
<Vivix> I mean when you think about it, Trixie was interrupted during a show, ofcourse she got pissed
<Inquisitor> well... not hard...
<P0n-3> I can't wait!
<DarkDemonWolf76> they did NOT give her a chance to change

<Vivix> yeah
<BronyDownUnder> i was derping around on Funny Junk when i found a fan made video of this then i read the description and my first thought was "MLP? really" then "well if theres fan made stuff it cant be that bad" i joined the herd in the season gap because i remeber having a season 1 marethon...
<repony> yeah

<DocSane> I have to say, the editing on this is top notch
<BluePyro> ballad of pinkie.
<Fazana> snileyfaisew
<Vivix> ahh
<DarkDemonWolf76> its FRIENDSHIP is magic not "OUR LITTLE CLICK AND NOT YOU" is magic
<P0n-3> What's that German guy?
<Dashie_Dashie> dis hd streaming is baws.
<Ware> I don't exactly get what the pony republic is
<ZokZokMeister> Tabitha is awesome
<Plotbuster> sacrifice a raccon to shmooz
<Shrimp3000> Yes.
<Cabooselololol> dam my internet
<Flutterdash> Raise your hooves into the sky
<Ware> pohhh
<Ware> ohhh*
<Sugar-Rush> This show brought me closer to a best friend that I was drifting away from. That, and the fact that i started catching the same bus as her.
<Zombine> I'm just using the low standard opera one and it's working so....
<ScootalooWonderloo> xD its a double troll @Sumica
<Ware> Russian dancing ponies!!1
<Inquisitor> I wouldn't mind this one, if I didn't hear this song every 2 seconds when my old boss plugged in his ipod...
<ChancellorPudinghead> party with pinkie isnt really dubstep tho:)
<GermanBrony> Another fan-made game.
<Plotbuster> raccoon*
<Phoenix> OBJECTION!
<TWISTeD398> :)
<Pwny> well, I don't mind these adds, but I cannot fathom why I should apply for a greencard...
<repony> later
<Victor> Its one of the few absolutely epic anti-war songs out there
<Ware> gotta watch that XD

<P0n-3> Wow I haven't even heard of that one.
<Arebear> :DDDD
<Quin2> wow this is cool
<Martin> I really^10 hope that there's no adds when the episode airs. :(
<DapperJack> after derpy i have to admit that I would love to see them make a doctor whooves reference
<Yaya> it's bland
<Ware> If you are reading this streamer, show them!
<Plotbuster> indeed
<pony_9129> it was pretty cool i guess
<ChancellorPudinghead> well
<Jean> Yeah I started watching around the time s2e03 was out
<P0n-3> THere are thousands and thousands and thousands of bronies, I can't even keep up with stuff any more.
<ChancellorPudinghead> maybe coz its awesome:D
<BronyDownUnder> Even though im a brony to this day im still discovering the full brony potential
<Jean> Caught up in time for the luan ep
<Hellspawn> Hello everypony!

<GermanBrony> It loks enormously promising. Have a look at it on YT.
<Vivix> and yeah Trixie wasnt treated fairly-I mean eh she got interrupted, shes a snarky mare and coonfident, she reacted the way she did, the OTHER ponies seemed to love the show before that interruption
<Phase4> is anyone else getting the random buffering?
<DapperJack> a very visual pmv personally
<Ware> said so
<ZokZokMeister> haha
<Victor> Pfft xD
<Phase4> Sumica, nope, just *ding*
<Amras0000> I agree
<ZokZokMeister> woooona

<ChancellorPudinghead> also sunshine & celery stalks
<rnbw_dsh> wow, this PMV is really good o.O
<LupusStriker> g'day
<Phase4> hopefully this clears itself up for the episode
<Vinyl_Sratch> why cant movies have preshows like this...
<gamemaster257> I've cleared my cache and my cookies
<Zombine> I think I'll just read...
<Gameman246> I caught on to MLP during the gap between ep 11 and 12 of Season 2.
<dshannon> ahhh political implications i see what you did there
<Kewpa> YESS I love that one
<Ware> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=NcTM-lRxPbs
<FlutterKawaii> ikr?

<Pwny> some hendrix pony, that would be nice
<Gameman246> Basically, during these holidays.
<d3rb> oh damn...ad's
<Plotbuster> yeah, pretty good
<CanadianSinna> damn right
<Vivix> So if I write something like twixie or trixie some day, I think trixie would be mad at rainbow dash, not twilight
<PonyCinny> Just run to the right side man, he won't attack =)
<Yaya> welcome to the jungle, everypony
<DarkDemonWolf76> EXSACTLY they could have toguht her about how horrible bragging is instead of "oh my friends better than you"
<fluttermedic> thanks Ware ^^
<Subscyed> notsure if want to start firefox with 284 tabs waiting to be opened simultaneously.
<Jean> I think the ponies watching trixie before the interruption were just there because she was so loud in order to draw attention
<ZokZokMeister> I caught up right at the start of se02
<kevinsano> so are these ads going to mess around during the episode itself?
<Fazana> trollfaise
<Jean> not because they loved it
<Wright> OBJECTION
<Phase4> so who's streaming?
<Inquisitor> but no, I'm not laggin or bufferin
<dshannon> to the right celestia to the left luna
<DapperJack> beware of ads
<P0n-3> LOL!
<Cabooselololol> chrome freezing when u close youtube is a common bug TM
<SASFalcon> Speaking of which, finished Dark Souls about 30 minutes ago (after 50 hours)

<BronyDownUnder> well done
<gamemaster257> hmmm I'll grab my laptop and see if it works on there
<Martin> I love how PMVs show me awesome songs. First Hollywood Undead and now this.

<OhItsFluttershy> ...thats what they're talking about, right?
<rnbw_dsh> I concur

<Shrimp3000> try pressing ctrl-f5, and wait for a while.
<DapperJack> lol
<Nyria> <3 it~
<Quin2> how do you get adblock?
<DocSane> You can only read one at a time.
<Flutterdash> Not my taste in music, but the PMV itself is pretty good!
<OhItsFluttershy> ...oh god
<PonyCinny> How do you finish it? I'm 100 hours in on Ng +5 XD
<Ware> so freaking strange

<MirrorImage> Saphtehwolf - yes, this is the official italian dub opening
<Acid1c> SWEETIE BELLE WAS ON A CLOUD
<MrSpeedoz> the melody is good
<Inquisitor> if this is the Spanish pony opening, kudos, this is kinda catchy
<wassa> im dominican
<BDW> have you seen the Italiain OP for Daitarn 3

<Nopony> It is ITALIAN eople. Not Spanish
<Nyria> Is this the italian?~
<Arebear> I love ponies :)
<MrSpeedoz> but the lyrics haven't got any sense
<Nataxcan> english intro is best intro
<Starflash> I dont know myself, I'm not native italian ~
<DarkDemonWolf76> SHE SHOULD BE A MANE CHAR
<IrishDrunk> This is beautiful
<pony_8602> go andd fly
<pony_3507> ITALIANS ARE AWSOME AS JAPANESE

<pony_971> but i don't like pizza...
<ZearPony3> *Public Debt
<Granny_pie_loki> anyone know what this is?
<Banditen> best opening
<Java> Now I wonder what it sounds like in Japanese
<Mattwo> I know, it's not even anime
<SteveNoBeard> Nope

<otakon> to YOutbue!
<ColorStorm> Italy has a better intro!
<Marbles> Play Night Of POny!!!
<bdk336> but it sounds good
<Mattwo> More like americonime
<Makintosh> I'm from Poland and understood little bit of it
<Princess_Luna> I prefer this to the actual opening
<JowHoof> Why didn't twilight just do the magic thing for the zap apple harvest?
<otakon> ahme
<CanadianSinna> Spanish is same as Italian :P
<Sqoad> Why are the Italians seemingly the only ones to come up with this idea?
<Likonan> different atmosphere
<Moshakra> you don't say
<BluePyro> can we has intensive pony unit or some kind of Renard PMV?
<pony_777> Sounds okay, I guess.
<alex> translate?
<Gameman246> This is the MLP Italian opening
<ChancellorPudinghead> doesnt matter if you don't know italian :)
<Flutterlover17> i....kinda like this?
<SteveNoBeard> Granny, its hte Italian opening

<DatEpicVoice> yep.. but i think it fits the show
<OhItsFluttershy> Mike-393 Shut up!
<MrSpeedoz> it isn't so much good
<Nyria> I wish we had this intro~
<BumbivyTheShadowbolt> Just because you can't understand a song doesn't mean you can't appreciate it
<rnbw_dsh> WOW.. this is awesome!
<JTDrift> 5on't really like the Italian version because it's too "spoiler" heavy.
<String_Shredder> my leeetle pony
<Moshakra> xD

<pony_1311> Japan!!!! Where the fuck are you?
<Qmiser> Well it's a good thing I don't understand the lyrics, cause it sounds awesome as far as I can tell.
