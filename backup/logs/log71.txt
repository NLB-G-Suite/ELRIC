<HyperMetalLugia> That isn't boring :D
<Pattyrick> I need to sleep actually D=

<Pattyrick> That's something to do, but it is pretty darn boring
<Pattyrick> I wish my Italian language class was tomorrow
<prince-dari> Nope.
<Dman> : /
<Pattyrick> Anyways, goodnight
*Skylands slaps Pattyrick and HyperMetalLugia's whining
<prince-dari> I'm just waiting for an opportunity to get leverage.
<Dman> hey prince-dari i'm having 'technical difficulties' halp?
<Pattyrick> I can probably spend more time tomorrow on here
<prince-dari> What's the problem?
<Dman> We have a router
<Dman> it is connected via ehternet to house PC
<Dman> i have a laptop
<Dman> it detects the router wirelessly
<Pattyrick> *Warns Sky that she hasn't had her V8 yet and she's a slap away from needing one*
<Dman> when I click to connect ( i know it has a pass i got that) windows says
<HyperMetalLugia> |HAve fun with Italian Sausage class
<Dman> getting information from WLAN_blahblah
<Pattyrick> Mmmm, sausage class
<Dman> and then after like 20 seconds of this
<Dman> 'windows was unable to connect to this network'
<Pattyrick> Have fun hating me for no reason =D
<Dman> Now, if i connect my laptop, like right now, via ethernet it owrks
<Dman> thing is my room's on the other side of the house
<Dman> How I wireless has?
<Dman> also, other wireless networks I try give me the 'password:'
<Dman> message
<Dman> but MY one just goes 'getting info' then 'unable'
<Dman> : /
<prince-dari> Does it have an error message/code/number?
<Dman> hmm no i don't think so
<prince-dari> What OS are you on?
<Dman> ofc i've looked online, but the solutions are 'reset pc/roouter' done that
<Dman> Windows 7 x64 : /
<Dman> Other online solutions are 'derp enable discovery' which ofc i have enabled
<Dman> i had this problem like a few months ago at a friends house
<prince-dari> Have you tried wireless on that laptop before?
<prince-dari> Has it ever worked?
<Ray> 02<random> A psychic once told me that I'm psychic. </random>
<Dman> yes for 2 years in .... 11 networks
<Dman> just checked
<Espeon> 06o.o
<Dman> i only had this problem once before, and after much 'disable wireless card enable wireless card' it worked
<Dman> Just wondered if you knew what it was
<prince-dari> Have you tried removing the password on then network to see if that makes any difference?
<Dman> I haven't tried that but it's my dad's network, with just the pass on the back of the router, the one it comes with.
<Dman> i guess i could try that
<Pegacorn> I'M BAAAAAAAAAACK!
<Dman> Hey Pegacorn
<Barry> Hi Pegacorn
<prince-dari> Are you using wireless zero configuration?
<prince-dari> Or some other wireless client?
<Dman> i don't really know what that means
<prince-dari> Windows + R
<prince-dari> services.msc
<Dman> i'm just using my wireless card
<Pegacorn> No,i tried to get the Minecraft shirts in Battlefield Heroes (yarly)
*Kyu sits all over Espeon
<prince-dari> Scroll down and check wireless zero conifugration to see if it's running.

<Aurora> PUNS
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah, that's basically what it was
<Pegacorn> I was filling my water bottle.

<Dman> i wonder that too
<Dman> but eh
<prince-dari> Probably 20 years or so.
<prince-dari> Or maybe 20 years or so till someone makes the matrix.
<prince-dari> And the machines take over.
<Dman> and we blot out the sky
<Dman> anypony seen the animatrix?
<Silverscreen> 11MAC or PC, which do you prefer?
<prince-dari> You need to ask?
<prince-dari> :P
<Dman> lol
<Silverscreen> 11Yes.
<Dman> I prefer PC because it's what i'm used to, but I don't think it's 'superior in erry way to mac'
<prince-dari> Macs...Eugh.
<Dman> i haven't got a CLUE as to how to use macs
<prince-dari> I prefer PCs.
<Silverscreen> 11I'm a PC person.
<Dman> but i can use pcs good
<Dman> PC
<Dman> w00t
<Dman> OMAGAD!
<prince-dari> Macs are like the Windows Vista of computers.

<Dman> PRINCE-DARI!
<prince-dari> You fixed it?
<Dman> IT IT IT after like 5 hours IT is asking me for a password
<Dman> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<prince-dari> Lol, well that's good then.

<Dman> ok time to test it out
<Dman> off goes the ethernet cable
<Dman> . . .
<Dman> YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Dman> so prince-dari will you do streaming tonight / this week somepoint? :P
<prince-dari> LOL
<Dman> LOL wut?
<prince-dari> I thought your interenet had exploded just after you said it worked.
<prince-dari> Irony.
<Dman> hahaha
<Dman> twice
<Dman> nah
<Dman> IT WORKIES ^_^ =D
<Dman> so now i ... crap. now i won't be able to sleep :
<prince-dari> Well, I dunno, if anyone wants me to.
<Dman> :P
<Silverscreen> 11My arguements for PCs against Mac users:
<Silverscreen> 11 1. Macs are overpriced computers that have the exact same compatibilities as a PC that's only a quarter of the cost. 2. The only reason Macs don't get Viruses is because they aren't as popular and thus haven't warrented that much attention. 3. When something breaks on a PC, you don't have to get rid of the WHOLE FUCKING COMPUTER to get it fixed.
<Dman> i like 3.
<Dman> 3. is a good point
<Silverscreen> 11And technically, Macs ARE PCs, just with a brand name.
<Pegacorn> true dat
<Dman> ;__;
<Dman> ;_;
<Silverscreen> 11Apple invented computers. Microsoft perfected them.
<prince-dari> Apple invented computers? Wut
*Ray glomps
<Dman> eyedonno

<Silverscreen> 11Didn't Apple start before Microsoft?
<Dman> prince-dari if you wouldn't mind later on maybe you could do some streaming? 8 >
<Silverscreen> 11forget it, I'm talking shit now. *shuts up*

<Silverscreen> 11I should get streaming software. I have Netflix.
<Silverscreen> 11Netflix stream to me. I stream to Brony State. All win.

<prince-dari> Why does Apple make out as though the iPad is something completely new and creative? O_o
<Dman> hahaha
<Barry> Hi Silverscreen
<Silverscreen> 11Hi.
*Kosoveon is glomped o.o
*Kosoveon glomps back "Hi :3"
<Silverscreen> 11The Ipad is a fucking stupid idea.
<Dman> apple: you have phones then you have pcs and ipad is a 3rd product' the world: 'lolnope'
<prince-dari> The iPad is just a tablet with apps on it.
<prince-dari> Wut.
<prince-dari> Why is that so good?
<Dman> i'm saying it isn't
<prince-dari> I know.
<Dman> apple make iPad to be a 3rd product type
<prince-dari> It was just a rhetorical question .:P
<Dman> 'tablets'
<Dman> wtf no
<Silverscreen> 11The owner of an Ipad: "lol, I like having an Ipod Touch that I can't fit in a pocket."
<Pegacorn> true dat
<Dman> the owner of other tablets: 'lol, i like having an inferior pc with awful input system'
<Pegacorn> true
<Silverscreen> 11Seriously, the Ipad is just an oversized Ipod Touch. Apple would have been better off giving us the first touch-screen laptop.
<Silverscreen> 11But no. Ipad.
<prince-dari> Apple do do touch-screen laptops, don't they?
<Pegacorn> true dat
<prince-dari> Or is that just other people?
<Dman> iPod classic is only apple product i have and probably will ever need :P
<Silverscreen> 11Only after people bitched about the Ipad.
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Dman> prince-dari they exist by other people but i don't think apple have a macbook that's touch yet
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 10Froslass.

<Silverscreen> 11The only annoying thing about Microsoft is their fucking Vista OS, which they quickly realized was a mistake.
<Dman> Yes, BUT
<Dman> do not forget
<Dman> Millenium D=
<prince-dari> Lawl, one of the tech guys at Microsoft just said "Don't talk about Vista, it doesn't exist".
<prince-dari> To me.
<Pegacorn> true dat,but i have vista.
<Dman> millenium is to 2000 and XP as vista is to XP and 7
<Silverscreen> 11IT does exist. I HAVE TO FUCKING USE IT. >.<
<Dman> hahaha
<Barry> I have 7
<Dman> sivlerscreen - go to xp or 7 den
<Silverscreen> 11I want to, but my comp is designed for Vista, and I don't know what'll happen if I change the OS.
<prince-dari> >designed for an OS
<prince-dari> wut
<Dman> I've upgraded 5 family members' vista laptops to 7 so far
<Dman> you should do it. srsly.
<Silverscreen> 11Well, what I mean is that Vista came with it, and I'm not sure how it'll work with suddenly switching the OS.
<Dman> heh heh hahaha
*Silverscreen 11is derp when it comes to computer tech. 6_9
<prince-dari> Microsoft surface is where it's at though.
<Dman> my millenium tower came with durr millenium. i upgraded to xp. upgraded to vista back to xp. upgraded to 7.
<Silverscreen> 11Surface?
<Dman> mfw 7 worked better than all of the above
<prince-dari> Surface 2.0 <3
<May> 14!pokemon
<Dman> prince-dari OMAGAD have you seen windows 8
<Silverscreen> 11The problem with Windows 7 is how much fucking Ram and memory it takes up.
<prince-dari> The most fucking awesome thing I have ever seen in action.
<Dman> Microsoft must be trollin'

<NightSeas> 12yay
<drf|laptop> 03LOL i'm old as a fossil
<drf|laptop> 03that might make sense
<Silverscreen> 11OH MY GOD. XD
<Silverscreen> 11I just thought of something.
<Dman> what?
<May> 14XD
<Silverscreen> 11Microsoft beat Apple to making the ITable.
<Dman> I've played with similar stuff by other companies and it's fun but nothing advancing in usage. it stops being fun after 5 minutes. so eh
<Dman> Oh yes silverscreen
<prince-dari> Microsoft have had surace made for ages.
<Dman> Apple are always last, but one of the best, in nearly all industry
<prince-dari> This is 2.0
<Roara> 6ok so
<Roara> 6I'm housesitting right
<Roara> 6well, I pulled a lovely blonde move today
<NightSeas> 12Roara~~~
<Roara> 6forgot the inside garage door was locked at the knob
<Dman> mp4 players, computers, laptops
<Roara> 6so it wont open from the garage side
<prince-dari> I'm pretty sure Surface is years older than iPad even.
<Dman> HELL THEY BROUGHT OUT THEIR FIRST MONITOR only months ago
<Roara> 6I went into the garage with the dog so I could take him for a walk
<Roara> 6.....forgot the door was locked
<prince-dari> This video.
<Dman> viewan
<Roara> 6and it shut
<prince-dari> MFW Microsoft employee told me 90% of the stuff in it is already possible
<prince-dari> And is already made.
<Dman> yes seen this one too prince-dari
<Dman> it's SO AWESOME
<May> 14So you had to open the garage door?
<Roara> 6went through the main door to the front door
<Dman> i already said this is possible before, but because there's so many devices that come into play, and so many companies, not everyone owns the same devices
<Roara> 6and forgot that my OCD kicked in, and because I hate having an unlocked front door when I'm the only one home
<Dman> it's why i said earlier
<Dman> Yfw this is possible TODAY if the world were owned by only one tch company : /
<Roara> 6I forgot I locked that one too

<prince-dari> Microsoft. Y U NO GIEF ME DIS STOOFZ NAO
<drf|laptop> 03so Roara, there's a version of Speed that comes with a Digital Copy®. I bought it for kicks, and I'll rip it XD

<prince-dari> Dat electronic newspaper.
<Dman> so i already askedbut
<Dman> prince-dari have you seen windows 8?
<prince-dari> I dunno, some of the employees talked about it, we didn't get a demonstration though.
<Dman> also prince-dari paper, foldable endable screens exist! so awesome
<Silverscreen> 11It's funny, because when Iron Man 1 came out, Microsoft downright said that the interactive modling that Tony Stark used was 100% achievable in this day and age. Hence them multiplying that in Iron Man 2.
<Roara> 6I felt like an idiot though
<Dman> prince-dari there's a demo of windows 8 on a tablet. just one demo. just one on a tablet.
<Dman> it is full of fail i'm afraid
<Roara> 6I finally got in by dragging the ladder out of the garage, hopping the fence to unlock the gate, taking the ladder to the bathroom window (which is on a slope so it's too high to reach normally)
<Dman> Iron Man 2 inception : his heartpiecethingy is the entire attractionareathingy
<Roara> 6climbed through the window, unlocked the doors
<Silverscreen> 11whut?
<Roara> 6and then just for whatever reason...checked the front porch
<Dman> hisfacewhen his father had already before dying years before invented teh ultimate molecule
<prince-dari> I don't get why Microsoft are making a big deal about "cloud computing" all of a sudden, it's as though they've made a new term and decided it's 'the future' of Microsoft even though it's been around for ages.
<Roara> 6found a key hidden under the flowers x.x
<Dman> Silverscreen - you seen Iron Man 2? :P
<prince-dari> Well, they even told us it was the future of Microsoft.

<prince-dari> <_<
<prince-dari> Boring.

<Silverscreen> 11Twilight Sparkle or Twilight that sparkles?
<Dman> D:
<drf|laptop> 03since the calculator can hold up to 10 images and I only have 1 XD
*Kosoveon floofs back
<Quanyails> 7o.O
<Quanyails> 7Eh?
<drf|laptop> 03as in

<drf|laptop> 03then that's fine
<Dman> not great but not worstthingever
<Barry> Oh, oh, Superman Sunday
<Quanyails> 7I can squeeze them in, I bet.
<Quanyails> 7Since you only have one image...
<drf|laptop> 03and sigh, calculator programming would be SO much easier if there was an "infinity" symbol, like there is a theta etc
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03I mean I only have one image on my calculator presently.
<drf|laptop> 03the one you made me before

<ValtheJean> for some reason I find laughter contagious
<Dman> erryone does ;D
<drf|laptop> 03also Quanyails, if you could save it as .bmp that would be preferred, saves me from having to convert it.

<Silverscreen> 11I never seen the brony show either.
<HyperMetalLugia> ohai gaiz
<Dman> i've seen 2
<Silverscreen> 11What's it about?
<Denied_Existence> Well...
<drf|laptop> 03LOL

<Dman> and discuss stuff
<Denied_Existence> We talk about the news for the fandom
<Denied_Existence> We watch 1-2 episodes
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Skylands03)02WB* - <Skylands> 10Apparently I saved myself a memo last night titled "cake" and all it says is "I love it so much"

<Denied_Existence> Also, other various stuff
<Kosoveon> ocean is down?
<Silverscreen> 11"Processing video"
*Kosoveon tried reconnecting earlier but couldn't, thought it was just him
<Shadow_Lugia> 6Ayuppers.
<Dman> yea ...
<Denied_Existence> I believe it should be in about 45 minutes (If I am judging my timezone correctly)
<Silverscreen> 11I want to do a Siskel and Ebert esque review.
<Silverscreen> 11Of a movie
<Denied_Existence> I should double check
<ValtheJean> oh oh! Can I join? Can I be Ebert? :D
*Silverscreen 11is totally Roger Ebert in his viewing of movies.
<Silverscreen> 11lol, Val
<ValtheJean> I miss when it was Ebert and Roper :(
<Dman> i don't know who either of them are
<Denied_Existence> Lets see...if I am in texas and it starts at 9 eastern....
<Denied_Existence> It should start at either 7 or 8 for me
<Elky> me neither dman
<Denied_Existence> Am I right about that?
<Silverscreen> 11Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were two very, VERY talented movie reviewers during the 80's and 90's.
<Barry> cool
<Dman> i see
<Denied_Existence> Is Central time zone one or two hours different from eastern?
<Elky> wait, is Roger Ebert the one with the paralyzed jaw?
<ValtheJean> I can't say I agreed with them all the time, but they definitely presented movies well
<Silverscreen> 11In fact, I could just post Nostalgia Critics tribute to them if you all want to watch.
<prince-dari> Meh, how can you be a talented at reviewing something? Surely it's a majority of opinion based stuff?
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, Ebert's the one with the bad jaw.
<ValtheJean> lol dari, clearly you've never seen Zero Punctuation :P
<Elky> well, you can be good at analyzing a work...
<Silverscreen> 11Dari: yes, but the thing is that they cross-examined each other's reviews, making it much more entertaining to watch them.
<prince-dari> ValtheJean: Nope, never heard of it.
<Barry> it goes Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific
<ValtheJean> it's easy to say things are "good", but it's very hard to present WHY
<prince-dari> Silverscreen: So, they present the way they present their opinions is good?
<Denied_Existence> Well...then I have an HOUR AND 40 minutes
<Barry> from East to West
<ValtheJean> it's a very hillarious video game review
<Denied_Existence> I fucked my timezones up
<Silverscreen> 11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suYe0HQX5s4
<Silverscreen> 11MY TRAILER :d
<Denied_Existence> so never mind then, Circuit has plenty of time
<Silverscreen> 11:D*
<prince-dari> the way they present*
<ValtheJean> wait a minute...
<ValtheJean> silverscreen...did you show me this on the brony page before?
<ValtheJean> facebook, that is
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, but this one's been updated. The audio's been fixed and one or two clips changed.
<Dman> dat xmen theme
<ValtheJean> haha, such a small world! This whole time I thought you disappeared :P
<prince-dari> I think in the recent Xmen film Mystique (sp?) becoming evil was really poorly done.
<ValtheJean> I didn't even realize they MADE another
<Denied_Existence> Nicely done
<Silverscreen> 11Haven't seen First Class yet. I heard it's suppose to be a good reboot.
<Barry> First Class?
<Dashite> Latest X-men movie.
<Denied_Existence> Welp, I better go put my food in the oven, brb
<ValtheJean> it's as silver put it, a reboot basically (if I understand correctly, haven't seen it)
<Dashite> It's about Xavier and Lensher before they went their separate ways
<prince-dari> I thought it was just a prequel?
<ValtheJean> hmmm
<ValtheJean> I could be wrong then
<prince-dari> Hey Lambda.
<Dman> prince-dari ;__; one of my best friends (the one who sits next to me in maths) is talking to me on skype
<Silverscreen> 11nope. It was a downright Reboot. That's why you see miss Frost in it.
<prince-dari> It details events earlier than have been seen before.
<Dashite> It is a prequel, but the way they did it also writes out some of the stuff that happened in Wolverine Origins and X3.

<ValtheJean> I choose to refuse X3 exists
<Barry> X3 is pretty good
<Dashite> X3 was meh.
<prince-dari> Dman: Ahh.
<ValtheJean> *barf*
<Dashite> X2 was good.
<Silverscreen> 11X3 isn't as bad as people make it out, but it is still pretty bad.
<prince-dari> Did you tell him that he made you a brony yet?
<Barry> Haven't seen X2, though
<prince-dari> His face when
<prince-dari> >explode
<Dman> he didn't some other guy idd
<Denied_Existence> Alright, I am back
<prince-dari> Oh.
<Dman> he's the guy who saw one ep and sortaliked denial
<prince-dari> Ohhhh.
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Dman> but he doesn't know about me moving to spain possibly forever. that thing
<prince-dari> Right, I know now.
<Silverscreen> 11They changed too much between Wolverine and First class. The continuity (bum) is just...gone.
<Dashite> Obviously someone needs to pick X2 for movie night.
<Dman> he's the 'pony fetish!' guy haha
<Dashite> And it was changed for the better.
<Elky> you want to move to spain? Why?
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Denied_Existence> ....what?
<Denied_Existence> Who is this we are talking about...?
<Dman> a guy at school who takes the mick outta me for being a brony
<Dman> it's funny
<prince-dari> Wolverine's one line in First Class was so funny.
<Dashite> Now that Green Latern flopped, can we get Ryan Reynolds moved over to Deadpool? :D
<Denied_Existence> mick? I dont understand your slang
<Silverscreen> 11Dashite: I thought the same thing.
<Dman> i haven't seen first class yet
<Barry> He means mickie
<prince-dari> Denied_Existence: Seriously?
<Barry> or however you spell it
<Dashite> Wolverine Origins Deadpool was a travesty. :/
<Denied_Existence> That still tells me nothing
<prince-dari> MFW no one understands us Brits.
<prince-dari> ;__;
<Denied_Existence> You mean like sedatives?
<Dashite> What? Are you trying to say something?
*Silverscreen 11understands the brits.

<Dashite> Speak English!
<Kosoveon> hi ll
<ValtheJean> >loves British comedy, can't understand when actual British people talk to me >.<
<Barry> to take the mickie out of someone means to tease them mercelessly, right?
<Denied_Existence> Sprecken sie deutsch?
<Barry> mercilessly*
<prince-dari> Nein
<Denied_Existence> Aha!
<Pegacorn> What WAS Wolverine's one line in First Class?
<prince-dari> :P
<Dman> nur ein bisschen
<drf|laptop> 03Phew.
<drf|laptop> 03Just in time
<Dashite> He basically told Xavier and Lensher to piss off.
<drf|laptop> 03re-typed all the stupid notes that got erased :|
<Elky> relativ gut
<drf|laptop> 03now to put them on my calculator and go take a test
<Denied_Existence> Das ist gut!
<Pegacorn> Dashite,that is epic.
<Denied_Existence> So ein Pech...
<Dman> lawl es ist nur eine ...kleine deutsche? i don't know lol
<Dman> yea ein pech
<Dman> ich spreche ein pech
*Silverscreen 11wanted to strangle Fox Studio for how they portrayed Gambit.

<Dman> but i'd love to practice my german!
<ValtheJean> ...no hablo Deutches... :(
<Dman> um
<Dman> hallo, wie gehts?
<Dman> 'gehts?
<Dashite> I don't recall having any big issues with Gambit, but maybe I'm just not remembering right.
<Silverscreen> 11Gambit is the second most popular X-man, standing right behind Wolverine.
<Elky> Sehr gut, und dir?
<Dman> valthejean hablas espaniol?
<Denied_Existence> @Dman, you speak your bad luck?
<Dashite> What? Second best isn't Jubilee? :D
<Dman> Ich bin prima! =D

<Dman> i speak a little i thought i said
<ValtheJean> @Dman yo hablo espanol...god damn can't remember the word...pequina?
<Dman> valthejean - yo hablo poco espanol
<Denied_Existence> Ich spreche ein Pech= I speak bad luck.
<ValtheJean> ah, knew it was something with a p
<Denied_Existence> Or I speak a bad luck
<Dman> but i didn't say pech?
<Silverscreen> 11They made him a freaking farm boy rather than having his Cajun accent, they turned him into a downright pansy who got his ass kicked. Hell, the only thing they got right with him was his abilities, and even that they didn't use too much. On top of all that, he only had, what, fifteen to twenty minutes of screen time? If that?
<Dman> oh
<Denied_Existence> <Dman>: ich spreche ein pech
<Dman> cuz you said 'ein pech#
<Dman> i was like 'that probably means a little'
<Denied_Existence> Ja, So ein Pech=What bad luck! or just Bad luck!
<Dashite> Ah, okay. I got the issue now.
<prince-dari> Das ist meine lieblingsfach, lieblingsfach, lieblingsfach.

<Dman> no prince-dari no!
<prince-dari> You watched that?
<prince-dari> LOL
<Dman> also
<Denied_Existence> He said that is my favorite class?
<Elky> yeah, that's about what I gathered from my russian lessons
<prince-dari> AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Denied_Existence> yes, that is it

<Dman> FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUu
*Silverscreen 11is looking forward to seeing Captain America, Man of Steel, Batman 3 and The Avengers.
<ValtheJean> I hope they don't ruin Cap America
<Denied_Existence> Dari said 'That is my favorite subject' for y'all non-germans
<prince-dari> They play it in all the school? XD AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
*Dashite just got back from Captain America
<ValtheJean> they've been ruining too many good comic heroes...
<drf|laptop> 03well guys
<Silverscreen> 11Not really...
<drf|laptop> 03off to take a math exam
<drf|laptop> 03wish me luck :|
<Dashite> DC has been ruining their heroes.
<ValtheJean> at least Watchmen was alright...would have liked better story consistency, but the characters were solid
<Dashite> Marvel has been doing a pretty good job.
<Silverscreen> 11They did Iron Man and Hulk justice. Batman is Badass again. From what I hear, THOR was, while underwhelming, faithful to its roots...
<Denied_Existence> God...I am hungry as hell...
<ValtheJean> eh, Iron Man 1 I would have agreed with, but 2 was just awful
<Silverscreen> 11DC needs to do what Marvel did and make its own studio.
<Dashite> 2 wasn't awful. 2 wasn't as good as 1, but it wasn't awful.
<Silverscreen> 11Why Aweful? I agree a lot of it was just silly buildup for Avengers, but it wasn't bad.
<Silverscreen> 11Besides, 2 has FUCKING WAR MACHINE! :D
<Denied_Existence> http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/3020/shrugponybigmacbymoonga.png
<ValtheJean> well, for fear of drawing out a giant flame war, I'll just agree to disagree :P
<Dashite> Aw, come on! We want reasons!
<Dashite> :p
*Silverscreen 11goes with Denied's response.
<ValtheJean> I'm rather picky when it comes to movies
<Light_Latias> :<
<ValtheJean> I hate to admit it, but I'm a bit of an elitist when it comes to film. (I try really hard not to...but there it is)
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<Silverscreen> 11What does everyone think of the Spiderman reboot?
*Elky goes with 'comic book movies? who watches those?'
<prince-dari> Meh.
<ValtheJean> didn't know they did a reboot
<Barry> They have a Spiderman Reboot?
<Dashite> They haven't yet.

<Dashite> They're working on it.
<Silverscreen> 11Not yet.
<prince-dari> It seems a bit stupid.
<ValtheJean> well, at least they realize they've run the current spiderman into the ground
<Silverscreen> 11I agree, but you know them companies. MONEY MONEY MONEY!!!
<Dashite> They have to do something with it or the license reverts back to Marvel.
<ValtheJean> better they start new then try to revive that thing
<prince-dari> lods of emone
<Silverscreen> 11Val: The only reason they ran the old one into the ground is because they fucked up the Symbiote plot.
<Dashite> That was horrible. I loved that story line. :(
<ValtheJean> well, and hired Toby McGuire :P
<Silverscreen> 11McGuire wasn't bad as Parker. : /
<Dashite> Emo Toby for Spiderman 3.
<Dman> lol
<Dashite> The dance scene.
<Dashite> WTF man...
<Silverscreen> 11oh god, Emo Peter.
<ValtheJean> it may just come from my unprecedented hatred of everything Toby does
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> The dance scene. XD
<Barry> How do you guys think percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Sea of Monsters will be as a film?
<Silverscreen> 11FUCK THE PERCY JACKSON MOVIE FRANCHISE!!!!!!!!
<ValtheJean> they're actually making that?
<Barry> It is currently in development

<ValtheJean> lol
<Silverscreen> 11The actors seemed only half interested in the action, the characters didn't look or act the part half the time, AND IT FUCKING RUINED THE MYTHOLOGY IT'S BASED ON!!!
<Silverscreen> 11The damn Percy Jackson movie showed absolutly NO respect for either the books or the greek mythology.
<ValtheJean> lol, is suddenly reminded of the recent Clash of the Titans movies
<ValtheJean> movie*
<Silverscreen> 11It was obviously a cheep cop out for the studio to make a lot of money off a good idea.
<prince-dari> Pegacorn: http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/Scootabru.jpg
<Denied_Existence> I did think the 'YOU BURNING MONEY!? THIS IS A RECESSION!' Joke was funny
<ValtheJean> SCOOTABRU!!!
<Silverscreen> 11the first Clash of the Titans was good. While it didn't have it's mythology 100% accurate, it at least had SOME semblance of the true myths, and it was actually entertaining.
<ValtheJean> @Silverscreen agreed
<Dashite> O.o
<ValtheJean> the recent one was...*shiver*
<Denied_Existence> Who set Silverscreen onto a tirade?
<Silverscreen> 11Refuse to see the new Clash of the Titans.

<Silverscreen> 11Elky: Yes.
<ValtheJean> lol
<Denied_Existence> OH GOD NO

<ValtheJean> the Clue movie was fucking brilliant
<Silverscreen> 11They are planning a remake of the original Clue movie.
<ValtheJean> Tim Curry...I love you
<ReticentSmolder> that's M Night Shitalan for ya

<Silverscreen> 11I mean, Cowboys and Aliens looks okay, but that's because IT HAS SUBSTANCE! IT HAS PLOT!
<Denied_Existence> good movie? HAVE SOME FREE ALIENS
<Dashite> It really doesn't.

<Denied_Existence> Shit computer is shit!
<Pegacorn> @ValtheJean:Actually,i thought that episode was tasteless.
<Denied_Existence> Hmm...
<Silverscreen> 11You just said shit is better than Uwe Boll
<Dman> denied_existence do you have any huggable :3 pics of Luna?
<Silverscreen> 11You, sir, just commited blasphemy
<Denied_Existence> Let me see...
<Dman> denied_existence it's the chat, it doens't count ( ) as part of links
<ValtheJean> @Pegacorn really? Have you watched other SP episodes or was that your first?
<Dashite> Well, there are varying degrees of shit...
<Denied_Existence> I have some on my iPhone, let me get them
<Dman> ty
<Pegacorn> @ValtheJean:I did watch other episodes before it,namely the WoW episode and "Good times with Weapons".
<Silverscreen> 11I can understand making a movie based on a board game. Because board games don't have a story, and if they do, it's really vague.
<Silverscreen> 11Video games on the other hand...no point.
<Silverscreen> 11Video games are just interactive movies on their own.
<Dman> funny silverscreen
<Dman> Resi evil 1 wasn't bad
<Dman> but wasn't at all like the videogame
<Dman> 2 and 3 are awful
<ValtheJean> @Pegacorn hmmm. Well, I don't really know what to say. I guess to each his own?
<Dman> and 4 was incredibly fun to watch as it was almost identical to videogames
<ValtheJean> lol, Dman, sorry but I hated the RE1 movies...well, all of them
<ValtheJean> movie(
<ValtheJean> jeez...my grammar today
<Dman> 4 is also awful, but fun to watch
<Dashite> The Doom movie!
<Dman> >dat final 10 mins
<Pegacorn> @ValtheJean:Eeyup,to each his own.
<Silverscreen> 11The Doom movie was fucking awesome, and I don't care what anyone says.
<Dashite> lol
<ValtheJean> I just don't think movies based on games should exist
<Denied_Existence> How do I put up a picture from my computer?
<Dashite> The only good part of that movie was the FPS section.
<ValtheJean> they just shouldn't
<Dman> my dad had the film for years and only later found out it was vidya
<ValtheJean> two completely different mediums, not meant to interact
<Denied_Existence> Silverscreen, how do I put a picture off my computer up here?
<Pegacorn> Nopony should diss The Rock OR Doom,unless they want to get the hell beaten outta them.
<Silverscreen> 11So does that mean we shouldn't have video games based on movies either?
<ValtheJean> eeyup
<Dashite> Of course.
<ValtheJean> those are even worse
<Dman> sadly yes
<Dman> i say sadly because spiderman 2 was amazing
<Dashite> Have you played any of those licensed games?
<Silverscreen> 11Street Fighter: the Video Game.
<ValtheJean> never was a fan of Street Fighter

<Light_Latias> o.o
<Silverscreen> 11I know, I was explaining it to Barry.
<ValtheJean> didn't they make a mortal kombat movie at one point?

<Barry> I think there's a trope for that
<Silverscreen> 11Val: Yes.
<Dman> yea
<ReticentSmolder> lol, the Street Fighter movie? was it as bad as Mortal Kombat?
<Dashite> They made 3 MK movies I think.

<prince-dari> I've never seen it.
<Dman> perhaps ED posted 55 'stead of 44 and reposted
<Silverscreen> 11Dari: play this and you'll see why.
<Dman> prince-dari because the show is so good
<ValtheJean> that pretty much sums it up right there
<Dman> the movie rushed
<Elky> looks like it
<Pegacorn> ONLY MY MOVIES SUCK.MY MOVIES SUCK!
<Dman> whereas eveerything in the show, every SECOND, was incredible
<Dman> HAHAHAHA silverscreen! i haven't seen this video!
<prince-dari> ...
<ValtheJean> awww
<Dman> so prince-dari you can begin to see something right?

<prince-dari> Crisps?
<Dman> ...wrapper sound?
<prince-dari> Ahh.
<Silverscreen> 11Dari: the action of the show was incredible. The live action was sloooow in its action and the acting was more fucking wooden than Pinnochio.
<RobotPinkie> Maybe it's crisps blood?
<Dman> keyboard?
<prince-dari> Bombay Mix. :P
<Dman> ah

<RobotPinkie> Currently watching Kamen Rider Kuuga
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/SFLwG.jpg
<prince-dari> Anyone else got anything to play then?
<Silverscreen> 11Avatar (movie) was good, though way too cliche.
<Dman> lol
<Silverscreen> 11Avatar (series) was fucking badass.
<Silverscreen> 11and I keep hearing Dari's crisps.
<prince-dari> >_>
<prince-dari> MFW not crisps.
<prince-dari> :P
<RobotPinkie> Avatar as in the last airbender movie?
<Dman> it's actually the fuel o' britan, innit
<Silverscreen> 11Not the movie.

<Silverscreen> 11...
<Dman> silverscreen has no idea lol
<Dman> or is it about robotpinkie's ignorance?
<Silverscreen> 11I thought I just made myself clear on that.
<Dman> yup
<Silverscreen> 11Avatar (movie, with blue smurfs) was good, but cliche
<Dman> ok ... no one got anything to play while we chat? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_wKEQLHhqc
<Silverscreen> 11Avatar (series, with bending) was badass.
<Aurora> 6we've all been decieved
<Dman> hmm
<Silverscreen> 11Airbender (movie) made me want to castrate all involved with it.
<prince-dari> Lawl.
*Aurora 6uses deceptive zoroark powers to be an espeon
<Dman> oh you are ... JOKING
<RobotPinkie> Then I gotcha.
<Elky> blue Avatar was horribly boring, I wouldn't want to sit through it again.
<ValtheJean> >Implying I haven't already castrated all involved with the airbender movie
<Silverscreen> 11Speaking of smurfs, that Smurf movie is gonna blow.
<Dman> prince-dari did that link not work either?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<ValtheJean> smurf....MOVIE...?
<RobotPinkie> I didn't like the movie Avatar much though, I mean it's... uh... pretty much one giant cliche after another.
<ValtheJean> you...you're joking me...right?
<Elky> smurf movie? OHGODWHY
<RobotPinkie> Very pretty, though.
<Dman> ok i'll just find some sorta montage
<ValtheJean> like...they wouldn't actually do that
<Dman> something like that
<Dman> I GOT IT
<Elky> man, 2010 was a good year for movies, but 2011 blows so far
<Silverscreen> 11Yes, they're making a movie based on the 90's cartoon of The Smurfs...which is based in FUCKING NEW YORK CITY! HELLOOOOOOO!!!!
<ValtheJean> I HAVE TOO MUCH FAITH IN MANKIND FOR THERE TO BE A SMURF MOVIE
<Pegacorn> The smurf movie's SFX are so horrible,they give me nightmares.
<Dman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91hi5GxmUPQ
<Dman> this is an awesum animashun
<Silverscreen> 11Special Effects or Sound Effects?
<RobotPinkie> but... but.... Neil Patrick Harris?
<Dman> also, prince-dari did you sleep during today? I haven't slept yet
<Pegacorn> Special FX,CGI,whatever.
<Silverscreen> 11Special Effects for the Smurfs is great. The voice acting makes me cringe.
<prince-dari> Yeah I did Dman.
<Dman> :P
<RobotPinkie> Does that not at least slightly increase the chances of the Smurfs movie being enjoyable?
<Dman> well i'm gettin' tired >_<

<Dman> 4chan is very overrated and sucky sadly
<Shadow_Lugia> 6o.o
<Dman> elky - true dat!
<ValtheJean> the only reason I don't outright hate 4chan:
<Dman> /ck/ is amazing thou
<ValtheJean> I wouldn't have found ponies without it >.<

<ReticentSmolder> this is the addition to the main theme they snuck into a plushie
<Dman> lol it was quite hard
<Dman> yes it is reticentsmolder ; )
<Barry> @pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12Barry is 7Applej8ack
<Dman> anypony into smash brothers brawl?
<ValtheJean> ee...nah
*Silverscreen 11raises his hand.
<Dman> if so i have a few good vids, but if not i'll find others :P
<Silverscreen> 11BRAWL! :D
<Dman> W00t! are you into metagame?
<RobotPinkie> not anymore, unfortunately
<Dman> huh huh?
<Dman> aww robotpinkie
<Silverscreen> 11metagame?
<Barry> hello
<Silverscreen> 11what?
<Dman> aftergame
<Dman> finding new stuff out
<Silverscreen> 11oh.
<Silverscreen> 11YES!
<Dman> like the techs, the DACUS
<Dman> etc
<Dman> WOOT
<prince-dari> Hmm, I have brawl, but I hear the melee was th shit.
<ReticentSmolder> I can't find the easter egg :(
<Dman> Prince-dari they're both good and different
<Elky> me neither, any hints?
<prince-dari> You had to take part in my puzzle. :P
<Silverscreen> 11Melee was awesome, though personally I like Brawl better.
<Dman> so i'd like to post a vid then :P
<ValtheJean> yeah, the professional players went back to melee because of Brawl failing
<Dman> this is the greatest set i've seen
<Silverscreen> 11:P
<prince-dari> the*
<Dman> silverscreen why wub woo for being a fan and to all who like brawl: prepare to WHOA
<Silverscreen> 11Brawl doesn't fail, it just has overpowered characters just like Street Fighter.
<Dman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPxyBPblWYU&feature=channel_video_title
<Dman> This is the best set ever
<RobotPinkie> Street Fighter 3 is best Street Fighter.
<Dman> Also silverscreen
<ValtheJean> well, imo a fighting game requires balance above all else
<Dman> it's link v Falcon. no overpowered shiz here
<Dman> and thank you so much prince-dari for streaming!
<ValtheJean> if you're limiting your gameplay so extensively, your characters NEED to be refined and balanced
<ReticentSmolder> inb4 Link is op
<prince-dari> No problem.
<Dman> also prince - calzorz is british. can ya tell?
<ValtheJean> which is why I prefer what TF2 USED to be
<Dman> (one of 2 comentators)
<Dman> he mains snake
<Silverscreen> 11what's wrong with TF2 now?
<Dman> and Izaw is best link evar! (Izaw fanboy here lol)
<ValtheJean> TF2 used to actually be balanced and refined, whereas nowadays it's a piss-nest of hats and imbalanced items
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<Dman> hahaha prince-dari
<Dman> brit =]
<RobotPinkie> or what TF2 still is on consoles?
<Dman> these guys are insane
<ValtheJean> *sigh*...I miss the days of HL2:DM...
<ValtheJean> oh fuck you smilie
<Dman> the ... i think 3rd match is the best
<ValtheJean> HL2: DM

<Dman> oh you silly, 'if i was him'
<ReticentSmolder> I'm not sure if I like the RD brushable pose, but I like the Twilight Sparkle...>hasn't bought any merch yet :(

<Aurora> 6I
<Dman> lol :D
<Aurora> 6need to draw that
<Espeon> 06Victory is mine
<Espeon> 06:3c
<RobotPinkie> Same here, kinda
<Aurora> 6along with the other 30 eon ideas we've radomly spurred
<Elky> eh, I don't feel that much of a craving for pony stuff
<Elky> pictures on the internet are enough
<ReticentSmolder> I think I would want one, just to brag I had it
<Dman> brawl funfact: all american players camp with projectiles. all europlayers are hardcore and attack and make games fun to watch.
<Espeon> 06EON CONCEPT DUMP
<Espeon> 06best dump
<Dman> ok not ALL
<Aurora> 6OH GOD HERE WE GO
<Dman> but easily the majority
<Aurora> 6I'm already preparing 3 dumps from my sketchbooks that just got tossed out
<Silverscreen> 11Izaw kicked Haze's ass.
<Dman> 'he just DI's like a pro' (Directional Influences)
<ReticentSmolder> its not Link's fault that his projectiles compliment his melee so well
<Aurora> 6eon dump later this week
<Elky> I'm rooting for haze
<Dman> Silverscreen - this is 2nd best match now : P next match is best match
<RobotPinkie> stream kinda lags for me, link won, i presume?
*Silverscreen 11uses Pit and goes for an all out attack.
<Dman> D:
<ReticentSmolder> oh god...pit
<Dman> NICE TRY NICE TRY NICE TRY NICE TRY NICE TRY NICE TRY NICE TRY
<ReticentSmolder> so much hate
<Silverscreen> 11Pitt is my favorite character.
<Silverscreen> 11why the hate for Pitt?
<ReticentSmolder> pit is awesome, I just hate fighting him
<Dman> eh i can respect that sure why not
<ReticentSmolder> my fav is Samus, and no, not because of the fucking charge shot :D because of the fire
<Silverscreen> 11damn. Izaw is kicking ass this round.
<Dman> silverscreen - he was (before not now) seen as a kid hitting puberty for voice, and spammy
<Silverscreen> 11Spammy?
<Dman> cuz he has the shield (durr you can grab) and he has the side b HAYIYEYA
<Dman> which locks you in
<Dman> but during metagame about 2 years ago
<Dman> we discovered DI Directional Influence
<Dman> where every hit you recieve if you tap a direction you move that way a little
<Silverscreen> 11I hardley ever used the stupid shield. it left you open to physical attack.
<Dman> so you can get out of pit and it's fair =] but before pit was seen as spammy
<ReticentSmolder> which nerfed his side b huh?
<Dman> haha
<Dman> oh yes
<Dman> this match is GODLY
<Espeon> 064:3!
<ReticentSmolder> these custom skins are awesome, did he mod or are these available somehow??
<Dman> Reticentsmolder you mod
<Dman> it's really easy
*Silverscreen 11has seen some MLP mods to this.
<Dman> you need the homebrew channel first that's what allows you to mod stuff
<ReticentSmolder> oh wow, Izaw is raping him
*Dman has about 7 MLP songs and parasprite smashball
<NightSeas> 12Hiya Espeon :3
<Silverscreen> 11Epic.
<ReticentSmolder> I've seen a RD reskin of sonic
<Dman> fighting to winter wrap up remix is pretty fun
*Silverscreen 11has seen a stage redone as Cloudsdale.
<ReticentSmolder> or was it someone else?
<Silverscreen> 11has to be Sonic.
<ReticentSmolder> yeah, I saw the cloudsdale one
<Dman> but fighting to some legendary choir music or phantom ensemble or stuff is good too ; )
<Dman> you mad haze?
<Silverscreen> 11Choir music. One of Critic's top 11
<Dman> yes thats y i said it ^_^
<Ragnarok> since when did nicks drop from disuse on this server

<Aurora> 6since a long time ago
<Icy> Oh hi Dark_Shadow_Dragon
<Dman> that's it pretty much. if anyone has any other vids i don't mind prince-dari stopping this one
<Dman> unless you guys want to see the end
<Silverscreen> 11Izaw has an all-win streak going on here.
<Elky> prediction: haze will win this one
<Ragnarok> huh, k
<Dman> lol
<ReticentSmolder> they mentioned he was 3-1 in the series, how does Izaw match up to others?
<Dman> anyone know 'pony thread simulator'?
<RobotPinkie> nope
<Dman> Reticentsmolder = his best is like 4th in world before, but normally not incredibly high
<Elky> you're readin through /co/ threads?
<Dman> and in doubles (izaw plays LOADS of doubles) he once came 2nd
<Dman> elky it's a funny youtube vid

<Dman> mod *
<RobotPinkie> oh god what?
<Silverscreen> 11nice.
<RobotPinkie> yes, pony thread simulator
<Dman> brawlvault.co.cc is best place...i think its .co.cc
<ReticentSmolder> I like how even though the game has TONS of maps, the only 2 that people like are final destination and battlefield
<Dman> oh ok it isn't
<Dman> http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php this is exact link. even if you're not able to use the stuff you can stil see the sorta thing people do

<RobotPinkie> wow, really nice
<Dman> elky - higher percentage further you are launched
<Shadow_Lugia> 6So:
<Dman> also every hit deals percentage
<Dman> you die by falling offscreen
<Dman> in any way
<RobotPinkie> I should go though, I'll let you know how pony shopping goes next time.
<Elky> and you can't die by hp damage? nice
<ReticentSmolder> I really hate what they did to mario's down B :(
<Dman> Yes please robotpinkie let us know
<Shadow_Lugia> 6My cat toppled over my bottle of incense with her tail twice today, and in her alarm, she dug her claws into my skin while fleeing.

<nickstr> yay! STEREO FROM WLS 890 CHICAGO!
<drf|laptop> 03all that effort I made to use notes on my test
<drf|laptop> 03completely failed
<drf|laptop> 03my calculator reset itself >_>
<AeroDracohem> oAo
<nickstr> oops
<Dragonite> 07fantastic o.o
<drf|laptop> 03well, one of the apps froze and locked it up
<Dragonite> 07happened to me once
<Dragonite> 07.-.
<drf|laptop> 03and every time you yank the battery out it resets the RAM
<drf|laptop> 03I need to figure out how to use OmniCalc's RAM backup thing
<drf|laptop> 03for silver editions only, it can suppoesdly backup the RAM every time you turn the calculator of
<drf|laptop> 03*off
<drf|laptop> 03so if it gets forcibly reset like that...
<Dragonite> 07omnicalc?
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03it's an addon pack that lets you do cool sutff
<drf|laptop> 03*stuff
<drf|laptop> 03for TI-83+ based calculators, anyway
<Dragonite> 07ah
<drf|laptop> 03I would love a TI-89
<drf|laptop> 03the problem with those is they actually make it really annoying to do everyday math LOL
<drf|laptop> 03if you aren't using it for hardcore equations, good luck
<drf|laptop> 03so I'll stick with my TI-83+ Silver Edition
<Dragonite> 07lol
<Dragonite> 07see
<Dragonite> 07I had an 89
<Dragonite> 07couldn't use it in some classes
<drf|laptop> 03I remember a few kids did and they were like "HAHA LOOK I CAN DO ALL THE TEST QUESTIONS"
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03see, our teachers were stupid
<Chimera> 04drf
<Chimera> 04you fail
<Chimera> 04See
<Chimera> 04You need an app that SAYS the calculator reset
<Chimera> 04but it really DIDN'T
<SilverSonic> lmfao theres someone on SC with the nick Shiny-Growlithe XD
<Dragonite> 07wait
<Dragonite> 07can't you archive things without that app already?
<Lambda> or here
<Chimera> 04no your ram clearing means your notes are wiped
<Lambda> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N57VrjyD_r8&NR=1
<Lambda> metal version
<Dragonite> 07which is why you move it to archive memory
<Dragonite> 07o.o
<Lambda> although, like it says in the descritpion, it sounds more punk than metal
<drf|laptop> 03exactly
<drf|laptop> 03Chimera
<drf|laptop> 03you missed the point
<drf|laptop> 03my teacher doesn't check our calculators or anything
<drf|laptop> 03but
<drf|laptop> 03I had a program FREEZE on me, and if you take the batteries out while a program is running, it resets the RAM
<drf|laptop> 03for freal
<drf|laptop> 03*real
<drf|laptop> 03and I couldn't cause it to Err: Break on me either, LOL
<drf|laptop> 03Guess that's what I get for trying to make it give me an 8-term Taylor series >_>
<drf|laptop> 03WHY THE FRICK IS MY XBOX NOT CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET :@
<HyperMetalLugia> It's a xbox?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<SilverMane> oooo
<drf|laptop> 03...
<HyperMetalLugia> Try updating your router's firmware
<drf|laptop> 03making it a not static IP seems to work
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLwat
<drf|laptop> 03so my question is who the FRICK took 192.168.1.169
<drf|laptop> 03I assigned that to my Xbox
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<HyperMetalLugia> That is fail
<drf|laptop> 03god, if I have to go around static IP'ing every computer in the house, I will .-.
<HyperMetalLugia> Search your network for sappers? o.o
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03I think it's my sister's laptop
<drf|laptop> 03it happened once before
<HyperMetalLugia> Aha
<Dragonite> 07someone or something with a dynamic IP took it lol
<drf|laptop> 03hers is set to automatic but it seems to like 192.168.1.169
<drf|laptop> 03why the frick would anything go that high
<drf|laptop> 03it starts at 100
<drf|laptop> 03most devices are like 100-110 >_>
<drf|laptop> 03I set my stuff uniquely, 142 for my desktop and 169 for my xbox, then 199 for my other computer
<Dragonite> 07I thought it was always random
<drf|laptop> 03it's usually somewhat random
<HyperMetalLugia> Most of my devices do .001 to .010
<HyperMetalLugia> XD
<drf|laptop> 03^
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah
<drf|laptop> 03usually it just uses the lowest available number
<drf|laptop> 03USUALLY
<drf|laptop> 03Apparently my sister's laptop likes 69'ing as much as I do
*drf|laptop runs
<HyperMetalLugia> Haha
<drf|laptop> 03yep, IP conflict
<drf|laptop> 03OK here's what I'm going to do since I'm too lazy to walk upstairs and tell my sister to reboot her laptop
<drf|laptop> 03I'm gonna go reboot the router

<RainBroDash> y'all see the colbert brony reference?
<SilverMane> hey, you aren't banned anymore!
<RainBroDash> ikr
<Dashite> We were just talking about it.
<SilverMane> they've been talking about it
<RainBroDash> win
<RDash> Nittany_Tiger_ Wait! He did that today? I just recorded the series today :D
<Nittany_Tiger_> Watch the beginning. Brony shout-out.
<Black_Latios> 2*shrugs*
*RDash watches
<Nittany_Tiger_> It's what a ton of people have been wanting for a while.
<SilverMane> QUICK! Throw me some good single-shot fanfics to read!
<Dashite> Skittles.
<Dashite> :D
<RDash> Steven seems like the type of person that would be a brony
<SilverMane> Skittles?
<Dashite> Yes
<SilverMane> Steven seems like the type that would milk the brony community for attention
<Nittany_Tiger_> If only (more?) US Congressmen were bronies.
<SilverMane> was Skittles that Pinkie and RD fic about the candy?
<Dashite> Yes
<Nittany_Tiger_> SilverMane: Possibly.
<Polarfire> more US congressman? :S
<Polarfire> how many do you think are bronies now?
<SilverMane> maybe 1 or 2. also, POLARFIRE!
<Polarfire> OHIA!
<SilverMane> how are you my brony?
<Nittany_Tiger_> I lol at the creation of the supercongress. That's fucking with the foundation of our (US) government.
<Polarfire> Doin great man. Just realized its 96 degrees at 11:00 at night.....
<SilverMane> ouch dude.
<Polarfire> eeyup
<Polarfire> It's killer down here.
<Dashite> 20C right now...
<Polarfire> Dashite it was 43C here today.
<Dashite> Ouch
<Polarfire> It's pretty hot. Hottest summer I can remember.
<Dashite> We had a couple weeks of that this summer. It's been around 28 for the past week though.
<Polarfire> Average temps have been around 5-7 degrees F hotter than average.
<Polarfire> And august is shaping up to be even worse.
<Polarfire> eugh
<Dashite> It's supposed to be pretty nice for August here.
<Polarfire> Canada for me please! :D
<SilverMane> i'm out bronies, night all.
<Polarfire> night, silver :)
<Dashite> 14 day trent looks like it's hovering around 26C for the next two weeks.
<Dashite> Later SilverMane.
<Nittany_Tiger_> It reached 90F today. Also rained.
<Nittany_Tiger_> With lotsa lightning.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Lotsa lightning is rare for PA.
<Polarfire> wow. lucky you. That tropical storm don that was supposed to bring us out of this drought... didn't happen.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Sorry about your drought.
<Nittany_Tiger_> I hate droughts.
<Polarfire> meh. I can't lie, its pretty bad, but things could always be worse.
<Dashite> Yeah, droughts suck. We had almost no rain through all of last month.
<Nittany_Tiger_> http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DM_state.htm?TX,S
<Dashite> We don't have anything quite that bad...
<Nittany_Tiger_> 100% of TX in drought. 99.85% in at least moderate drought. 75% in the highest drought category.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Fuck climate change.

<GGgala> hey, i heard the colbert report gave a brony shoutout tonight-- did anyone catch it?
<Dashite> Nope
<Nittany_Tiger_> I saw it, but didn't record it.
<Nittany_Tiger_> It was actually a couple of lines.
<Nittany_Tiger_> Then Colbert proceeded to start faking riding a horse.
<SoiPony> http://www.tumblr.com/photo/1280/8363449477/1/tumblr_lp8tkqKbGg1qexfqe
<Nittany_Tiger_> Still, it's like "The bronies that have been pushing Colbert to do a brony segment finally got something in return"
<GGgala> damn. that would've been prime stream material
<GGgala> >squidaloo

<Polarfire> ah.
<RDash> Hm, someone on ponychan asked fellow bronies to ask for ponies on his new "I stand for.." section on the Super PAC website: http://colbertsuperpac.electricpulp.com/
<RDash> Maybe that's why the shout out was given? Anyway's, I'm off there now to ask for a segment :3
<Polarfire> :D
<Polarfire> I shall join you
<Polarfire> hmm not really sure what to say
<RDash> He sure doesn't give much room to say something.
<Polarfire> yeah.. "I stand for bronies!" is all I've got right now XD
<RDash> I did that on another email address. This time I said something along the lines of "I stand for you adding a full segment to the report on My Little Pony:FIM

<Altair> SilverSonic, likewise
<Altair> years ago
<Polarfire> that's cool. I should really organize mine. Believe it or not, no metter what it is, I organize songs by tempo.
<Polarfire> Some are upbeat, some are relaxing, etc.
<SilverSonic> yeah, got to green belt with black stripe then i just kinda quit after december ;P
<Dashite> I can see how that might be useful.
<Polarfire> especially when I'm driving.
<Polarfire> XD
<SilverSonic> inb4 NS is a black belt
*SilverSonic shot
<Dashite> Yup.
<Altair> technically i still am a black belt
<Umbreon> 12o-O
<Altair> as you never really lose the title
<Umbreon> 12!silversonic
<Dashite> I've got a playlist that I use specifically for biking to school.
<SilverSonic> :o
<Altair> i got 2nd degree when i was 14 :P
<SilverSonic> :p
<Altair> but it got boring
<SilverSonic> ^ thats why i left
<Altair> try ju-jitsu
<Polarfire> really? that's cool. You're in Canada right?
<Altair> shit's crazy lol
<Altair> i did that for a while as well
*bed is 9001th degree
*bed runs
<Dashite> Yeah.
<SilverSonic> lmao Sneas :p
<Dashite> This song just came up. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqirqFJjBeE
<Polarfire> that's cool. How long is the biking trip?
<Altair> oshi-
<Dashite> It's about 9.5km one way.
<Polarfire> ah.
<Polarfire> How old do you have to be to get a driver's license up there?
<Dashite> 16
<Dashite> It varies by province, but the most common age is 16. I think it was only 14 in Alberta last I checked.
<Polarfire> hmm well I'm out of things to talk about :P
<Dashite> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiqznK5p5S8
<Polarfire> I leik
<Dashite> Very little of his stuff can be seen online unfortunately.
<Dashite> I saw him play live last summer at a local show. Was fantastic. :)
<Polarfire> thats awesome.
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<Polarfire> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZCYpkWj6Z4
<Dashite> I went to see that movie just for the music...
<Polarfire> I haven't seen it yet.
<Polarfire> I've got most of the songs though XD
<Dashite> Yeah, I bought the soundtrack.
<Dashite> First time I listened to it was in the middle of winter. I uploaded all the songs to my MP3 player, put on my warmest clothes and just laid down in the snow on our front lawn and watch the stars. The few I can see in the city...
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Drake03)02WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
<Polarfire> you live in a pretty urban area?
<Dashite> Small city, yeah.
<Polarfire> ah.
<Polarfire> < in the middle of nowhere
<Dashite> Heh.
<Flareon> hm
<Altair> hey Drake
<Polarfire> its nice though.
*Altair glomps LLOTS
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Hai Altair x3
*LugiaLordOfTheSeas snugs
*Altair snugs back ^^
<Altair> how are you?
<Polarfire> Very peaceful, hot as hell... but. Nothing really to stress over. Which I'm very anti-stress, so.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Tired, but good ^^, you/
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> ?*
<Dashite> Nice to visit, but I don't think I could live in the middle of nowhere.
<Polarfire> yeah. Probably why I spend so much time on the web. And I say middle of nowhere, there's my friends and a city close by, so I guess its not that nowhere-ish.
<Altair> Exactly the same :P
<Dashite> How close by is close by?
<SilverSonic> wow, some new idiot freshmen in my school decided it'd be cool to make a Baldwin's Best FB Page, listing who they think are the hottest guys and girls, way to make our town look bad x____x
<Polarfire> about a 20 minute drive. It depends on what you call a city.
<Polarfire> I guess the closest city is an hour away, the closest towns are about 20 minutes each.
<Dashite> It's about an hour to the nearest edge of Toronto. How far the rest of it is depends on the time of day. :D
<Polarfire> :) haha
<Polarfire> I don't care for the larger cities. Like I said, I'm very anti-stressed. And the people there are always in a hurry, they are running right by their life and they don't even know it.
<Polarfire> Stress is the #1 killer you know.
<Polarfire> indirectly I guess
<Dashite> I'm almost a polar opposite I guess. Lack of stress bugs me. Can't get anything done that way.
<Polarfire> XD

<Polarfire> haha. It takes a lot to get me worked up over something. I'm very laid back.
<Polarfire> When you get stressed time goes by faster.
<Polarfire> and so far in my life I have found 0 things to get worried about.
<Polarfire> life is too short to worry.
<Polarfire> As you could guess I'm usually late wherever I go.
<drf|laptop> 03http://sale.images.woot.com/Don_t_Mess_With_Me!r5sDetail.png
<Dashite> :D
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Dashite> I'm usually on time give or take 5 minutes.
<Polarfire> :)
<Flareon> 1 is ok, 2 is company, 3 is lunch
<Polarfire> that's good
<Flareon> xD
<Polarfire> my lateness depends on the event
<Polarfire> XD
<Dashite> Heh
<Polarfire> stuff usually doesn't get done as fast around me either. I take lots of breaks.
<Polarfire> :P
<Dashite> I take exactly one break.
<Freyskol> o.O
<Dashite> It usually starts whenever the task is assigned and ends a couple hours before the deadline. :p
<Polarfire> XD
<SilverSonic> x____x I'm so mad right now >_>
<Polarfire> procrastination? that's a lifestyle for me. XD
<drf|laptop> 03at what
<SilverSonic> well, some new idiot freshmen in my school decided it'd be cool to make a Baldwin's Best FB Page, listing who they think are the hottest guys and girls, way to make our town look bad x____x
<SilverSonic> and to make things worse, someone else started a "PPL who hate this" Kinda page aimed at the page just mentioned above
<SilverSonic> seriously, as if the rep of our town wasnt bad enough x____x
<Polarfire> Bot of my parents are very industrious and I have a natural distaste of authority so I guess its only natural I don't get worried about stuff.
<drf|laptop> 03why, you mad because you weren't one of the hottest?
*drf|laptop runs'
<Polarfire> And my grandfather died of a series of heart trouble (stress related) and I promised myself I wouldn't let that happen to me.
<SilverSonic> No.
<SilverSonic> I couldnt give a sh*t about that
<SilverSonic> what angers me is that this dumbass thinks its ok to be discriminative and decide whos hot and whos not :P
<SilverSonic> again i dont care what those idiots think of me
<SilverSonic> idiots refering to people at my school
<SilverSonic> but i just can't stand that people think this kind of Sh*te is ok
<Polarfire> you still here?
<drf|laptop> 03it totally is OK, if you're a guy looking for a hot girl :)
*drf|laptop runs
<SilverSonic> :P i already have someone kthx :P
<drf|laptop> 03I could say something mean
<drf|laptop> 03but w/e
<SilverSonic> xP
<Polarfire> hmm guess not : O

*Glacymr cooks pancakes for Pattyrick
<Pattyrick> Mmmm... How'd you know pancakes were my favorite? =D
<Glacymr> 12it's all over your name
<Pattyrick> Orly?
<Glacymr> 12just got to remove the ttyrick and add ncake
<Pattyrick> Lol
<Freyskol> i think pattycake
<Pattyrick> Hi Xanbrean
<Pattyrick> *breon
<Glacymr> 12i'm sure Freyskol likes tacos
<Glacymr> 12you just remove Freyskol and add taco
<Pattyrick> Pattycakes aren't complete without Mrs. Butterworth's syrup
<Glacymr> 12you'd love my pancakes
<Glacymr> 12i make them as gigantic as a large plate
<Glacymr> 12they aren't easy to flip lol
<Pattyrick> I'm sure I would :P
<Pattyrick> I haven't had a good pancake in a long time
<Glacymr> 12lololololol
*Glacymr gives Pattyrick some...... broccoli and oranges
<Pattyrick> Oranges, yes
<Pattyrick> Broccoli.... Nooooo
<Glacymr> 12you never had citrus flavored broccoli
<Pattyrick> Hi junh
<Glacymr> 12hi jun
<junh1024-X2> hi
<Pattyrick> I wanna I wanna rock right now
<junh1024-X2> <name of song> much ?
<Pattyrick> xD
<junh1024-XD> feck, they left
<Pattyrick> X2 is the name of one of my favorite roller coasters
<junh1024-XD> X2 is my secondary nick's secondary suffix.
<Pattyrick> Ok
<Pattyrick> iPod touch: more reliable than my PC
<Pattyrick> And I can sit on a couch and use it
<junh1024-XD> drf wouldn't be so happy seeing you say dis, ae?
<Pattyrick> Yup
<Pattyrick> But I can, since he's sleeping :P
<Pattyrick> I have it and an iPad, so he doesn't let me hee
<Pattyrick> *hear the end of it xD
<junh1024-XD> lol
<Pattyrick> What do you think about Apple iDevices?
<junh1024-XD> I do have an iMac at home, and some iPods, but
<junh1024-XD> It's sorta annoying to see everyone have them, ae?
<Pattyrick> I guess
<Pattyrick> I personally like them, but I wish there was some customization to them
<Pattyrick> My iPod is jailbroken, so I can install some good stuff to customize it
<junh1024-XD> Desktop Macs, can't really unless you buy peripherals
<junh1024-XD> Which is why I also have a PC (i'm on one now),
<junh1024-XD> I have installed in my PC a BD drive and a TV capcard.
<Pattyrick> I prefer PC to Mac, but I'd like to have a newer Mac as our family computer and a better PC as my gaming compuyer
<Pattyrick> *computer
<junh1024-XD> You can game on mac. Game devs are moving towwards having mac copies of games,
<junh1024-XD> and for those that don't, you can download unofficial ports.
<junh1024-XD> http://forum.portingteam.com/
<Pattyrick> I think a Mac version of RCT2 would do me in xD

<Dman> 0___0 whoa
<Dashite> 9th
<Dman> gooooooood mooooooooorneeeeeeeeeeeeng
<Dermathil> Dman: I mean I was on a vacation trip and it ended yesterday.
<Dashite> Good morning? No such thing.
<Barry> where'd you go?
<Dman> Ah. Did you go somewhere nice?
<Dman> lol dashite
<Dermathil> I went to Point Pelee.
<Barry> I might be going on a tour of the East Coast next summer
<Dermathil> Southernmost spot in Canada.
<Dman> near the coast?
<Barry> visiting various landmarks and amusement parks from Florida to Maine.
<Dermathil> Dman: nope
<Dman> Dermathil: did ya go swimming at all? I love swimming during summer it's nice~
<Dermathil> yes I did, Dman. That water was more than 80 degrees farenheit. (Dunno how hot it was in celcius, but it was the hottest non-heated water I ever swam in)
<Dermathil> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Pelee_National_Park
<Dman> cool i see it
<Barry> 31 degrees Celsius
<Dermathil> One side of the point was hot and the other's cold.
<Barry> never mind
<Barry> I thought you said 88
<Dman> 31? it's 35 here and goes to 50 (Granada, south of Spain xP )
<Barry> 26.67 degrees Celsius
<Barry> is 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
<Dman> still quite hot
<Dermathil> Dman: everything is cooler in America than in Europe due to the Gulf Stream.
<Dman> Yea dermathil, but taht's still quite hot :P
<Dermathil> I ain't got no idea how hot it actually was but it was the hottest I ever swam in.
<Dermathil> And the waves packed quite a punch when walking in em to swim. Be careful when they reach belt height.
<Dermathil> It hurts.
<Dman> ouch
<Dermathil> though the place was awesome. I easily swam for about a hour and a half without noticing the time passing.
<Dman> =D
<Dman> awesome!
<Dman> I'm watching 'Limitless' right now. What are you guys up to?
<Dashite> Contemplating going back to sleep.
<Dermathil> Nothing really. Just hanging around.
<Barry> I'm listening to some music from the Pokemon anime
<Dashite> I need to stop going to bed at 4am.
<Dman> Dashite - if you're tired sure do it, and Barry, that's awesome :P
<Barry> The one I'm listening to now is the Regi theme
<Dman> Dashite i woke up at 10am today, came online, for like 20 mins then went to bed till 12. I had an awesome ninja dream (i promise you this is true).
<Dman> No ninja dream guarranteed, but sleep is good.
<Barry> I'm having a bit of difficulty sleeping since my air conditioner copped out early in the Summer
<Barry> And I'm living in Central Florida
<Dman> : / it's hard to sleep in the hot
<Barry> yeah
<Dashite> My ac tries to freeze me out of the basement.
<Barry> Believe me, right now, I'd rather be freezing
<Dashite> How hot today?
<Barry> I think the high is around the mid 90's
<Dman> farenheit i'm guessing :P
<Dashite> No, it's totally celsius. :p
<Barry> [sarcasmmode] no, celsius
<Dman> Fahrenheit*
*Dermathil starts to listen to a song written about fallout 3 and contemplates starting to listen to it when reading FO:E from now on (yes, I caught up to the latest chapter in less than 4 days)
<Barry> I'm slightly comfortable in near 212 degrees Fahrenheit
<Dman> lotta reading
<Dman> lol
<Dashite> I think it took me 2 days, but there were only 16 chapters when I started.
<Dman> -1 Kelving :P
<Barry> impossible
<Dermathil> Dashite: I read all 34 chapters in under 4 days.
<Dman> dashite - i've still to even begin reading, but it's in my backlog
<Barry> you can't go below absolute zero
<Dman> >_< That's the joke!
<Dashite> That's why it's absolute!
<Barry> yep
<Dermathil> want a linkie to the song?
<Dman> even at absolute zero, the electrons are repelled by the protons (they attract but there's a limit and once too close the oposites actually repell!) this creates kinetic energy
<Dashite> [/intentionallyignoringthejoke]
<Dman> 0 kelvin, in theori, will never be reached

<Dman> Yes ofc seen this very vid :3

<Dashite> Wait a minute, he looks like he's doing that with a proper weapon. Swap it for a ladder.
<Dman> language in cantonese, english subs
<Dman> Lol dashite
<Dman> or a coffee table
<Barry> btw, subbed in cantonese needs no comma
<Dman> or soemthing
<Barry> neither does dubbed in cantonese
<Dman> i guess it doestn't, but it might've helped
<Dermathil> Barry: he meant he saw it subbed, and in cantonese
<Dman> cuz i meant i saw it subbed english, voice in cantonese
<Barry> ah
<Dman> >Oliver Piers Kenneth Edy
<Barry> oh, I get it now
<Dman> english subs, language in chinese
<Dman> that's what I meant
<Barry> subbed, in cantonese = in cantonese subbed
<Dermathil> ooh, I see RainBroDash in the chatlist
<Dman> that's what y meant, but theres a load of better ways to get that across, sorry Barry

<drf-Droid> you can run Adobe crap on Windows >_>
<Dman> I hope you're on about Inception
<Dusky|alt> Oh, and linux for advanced programming, like programming boards for big industrial machines :P
<Dman> then again i have never seen 'attack of the killer tomatoes' so i can't judge
<Dermathil> mane movie I speak of.
<Dermathil> Funny thing is that on the way to Point Pelee I went through the canadian Tomato capital.

<Dusky> Then, yes
<Dusky> :3
<drf-Droid> how am I a hypocrite
<Dman> 'It's a map!'
<Dusky> You only think one thing is bad as hell, even if its clearly not, and say bad things about it even if you never tought twice about it, or even TRIED using it, or think about it
<Dusky> Makes you the dumbass in this case, think twice before hating on stuff
<drf-Droid> I have tried using Apple products
<drf-Droid> I'm an educated hater
<Dusky> Educated hater? I think a hater who doesnt even try thinming about things twice!
<drf-Droid> when the people at the Apple store told me you can't cancel a download on an iPad

<drf-Droid> I was like FAIL
<prince-dari> The top comment on that video.
<prince-dari> Heheh.
<Dermathil> you will be assimilated.
<drf-Droid> and had to sit there waiting for it to finish so I could logout of iTunes >_>
<Dusky> On a ipad yes
<Dman> not dr who >_< Treasure Planet
<Dusky> But with e newer ios5 and ipad 2, makes alot of difference, amirite?
<drf-Droid> exactly
<Dashite> Not Dr Who. Star Trek
<drf-Droid> no?
<Dman> lol
<drf-Droid> it was the same iOS
<Dermathil> Dashite's got it.
<Dman> i've barely seen any star trek
<drf-Droid> still sucked
<RDash> Ah, be back later bronies
<Dermathil> LET'S GO! LETS GOKAIGER
<Dman> but to my left on the bookshelf is all 11 movies :P
<Dman> and some sort of 'borg' sniny dvd
<Pegacorn> i'm back
<Dusky> No, ios5 is the newer one, upgrading it makes inprovements
<Dman> shiny *
<drf-Droid> I actually try their stuff so I can make a good argument as to why it's a pile of crap :P
<Dman> See ya in a bit, RDash
<Dermathil> did someone draw the ponified gokaiger yet?
<Dusky> And i CAN cancel downloads, if its about that one problem
<Dman> I thought NewDCD posted it ages ago here
<drf-Droid> well it's also the fact that it's laggy as frick
<Dusky> Mmhmm, one or two flaws isnt enough to call is crap
<Dusky> And it isnt laggy :P
<drf-Droid> takes a whole two seconds to rotate
<drf-Droid> it was for me
<Dusky> That was then
<drf-Droid> and I actually tried the iPad 1
<drf-Droid> *2
<drf-Droid> still laggy as frick
<Dusky> Every changed, is newer, better, faster, not laggy
<Dermathil> I never saw it
<Dman> Im afraid i didn't save it and don't know the link to it
<drf-Droid> the Android tablets I tried were much less laggy and more responsive
<Dusky> See
<drf-Droid> plus, better hardware
<drf-Droid> no USB ports? what is that crap?
<Dusky> Fanboying over one thing, hatin over the other
<Ray> 02it takes me 8 secs to change windows in this pc, your argument is invalid :P
<Dusky> HYPOCRITE
<Ray> 02</laaate>
<drf-Droid> Ray get a new PC LOL
<drf-Droid> and um no?
<drf-Droid> I don't fanboy over Android
<drf-Droid> it has its annoyances too
<Dusky> Erm, everyone knows, yes
<Dman> : /
<Pegacorn> OF COURSE!CyBorg!BRILLIANT!
<drf-Droid> like how I can't record phonecalls >_>
<Dman> ?
<Dusky> And still, isnt 99.99999999% opinions? Like some of your opinions make you a hypocrite
<drf-Droid> it's more the hardware I don't like
<Dusky> Clearly
<Pegacorn> Somepony repost that "ROW ROW FIGHT DA POWAH" vid from last night!
<drf-Droid> opinions, yes, but I don't see how you think I'm a hypocrite o.o
<Dman> CyBorg because of the pronunciation on the 'CY' and the 'BORG' due to the guy exhaling so much
<Dusky> Think twice then
<Dman> pegacorn - sure
<prince-dari> Hay, guys. This argument is pretty pointless. :p
<Dusky> Why do people think you're a hypocrite...?
<Dman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91hi5GxmUPQ
<Dusky> Erm, maybe because you go ewwwww everytime someone names apple?
<drf-Droid> they don't, you do
<drf-Droid> no?
<Dusky> Quite pointless if i may say so
<Dman> DO THE IMPOSSIBLE SEE THE UNSEEABLE ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER TOUCH THE UNTOUCHABLE BREAK THE UNBREAKABLE ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER
<drf-Droid> and to be fair, Apple was good in the 80s.
<Dusky> And quite annoying, really
<drf-Droid> but not since then
<Dusky> And still is
<Pegacorn> Thanks Dman
<Dusky> Think about it
<drf-Droid> no.
<Dman> A. Ny. Time, bro, anytime
<Dusky> Android and microsoft based technology on apple
<drf-Droid> ...
<Dusky> Without apple, no android, market would collapse
<drf-Droid> Android has nothing to do with Microsoft
<Dusky> So if microsoft drops out
<Dusky> And android
<Dusky> And linux
<drf-Droid> it's based on Java
<drf-Droid> o.o
<drf-Droid> it's like Linux + Java
<Dman> 'hmmmmm delightfully tangy, yet, robust'
<Dusky> Mmhmm, i see, i see
<Dusky> Point is, people get annoyed when you go ewww about everything YOU think is assy, while its not
<drf-Droid> I didn't go ew, I just said blame Apple :P
<Dusky> *facepalms*
<drf-Droid> also the whole "it's not" thing is YOUR opinion, not fact
<Pegacorn> PROXYYYYYY PAWNCH!
<Dusky> And apple being suckish is YOUR opinion
<Dusky> Not fact
<Dusky> :3

<ValtheJean> Aloe and...damn can't remember her sisters name

<Dman> like 1/2 of friendship report q's done
<ValtheJean> nah, it's not Vera
<Barry> no
<ValtheJean> because I made that mistake before :P
<Dman> i'll try to finish friendship report Q's tonight. meebee we can test them out xP
<Dman> that would be fun
<Barry> Lotus
<Barry> Aloe and Lotus
<prince-dari> 5A8ce
<ValtheJean> Lotus
<ValtheJean> it's Aloe and Lotus
<Dman> rainbrodash hasn't accepted me yet on skype : <
<Ray> 02nope.mov
<Barry> Aloe and Lotus are fan names, though
<ValtheJean> lol, I didn't realize anyone here used skype
<Barry> but so is DJ Pon3
<Barry> and Steven Magnet
<prince-dari> DJ Pon3 isn't really.
<Barry> not anymore
<Barry> apparently
<prince-dari> I'd say canon since Equestria Girls.
<Barry> But it could still just be a stage name
<ValtheJean> As I've come to understand it, Vinyl Scratch is her real name, whereas DJ Pon3 is her fan name
<ValtheJean> though I could be wrong
<Barry> stage name
<prince-dari> Vinyl Scratch is just a fan name.
<prince-dari> DJ Pon3 is pretty much canon since Equestria Girls.
<Barry> Vinyl Scratch is still a fan name
<Barry> As far as we know, DJ Pon3 is a stage name
<prince-dari> Meh, DJ Pon3 probably isn't going to come back.
<Barry> maybe
<ValtheJean> I'm curious which of the side characters they'll bring back in S2
<prince-dari> I'd say it's safe to assume it's just her name.
<Barry> Luna
<Dman> So what's up now? what is everybrony up to?
<prince-dari> I doubt ponies have 'stage names'. :P
<Barry> She only got two lines last time
<Barry> Derpy is going from animator joke to full-on background pony
<ValtheJean> well yeah, obviously Luna
<ValtheJean> but they said a lot of side characters will be coming back
<Barry> and will have her derped eyes all the time
<prince-dari> 4Apple 8Bumpkin
<ValtheJean> I really hope they don't try to make her a larger role or have an episode about her as some bronies want
<Barry> it'll be more of a Where's Waldo thing
<ValtheJean> that's good
<prince-dari> >pony called Apple Cider
<prince-dari> Wut
<prince-dari> Ponies have alcahol?
<ValtheJean> of course, I will demand that she have a mail bag at some point :P
<prince-dari> Is that an official name or fan name?
<Barry> Cider isn't alcohol, yet
<ValtheJean> I didn't think Apple Cider was alcohol
<prince-dari> >cider no alcahol
<prince-dari> Wut
<prince-dari> not*
<Barry> I think cider is just unpasteurized juice
<prince-dari> "Cider varies in alcohol content from 2% abv to 8.5% abv or more in traditional English ciders."
<prince-dari> What are you guys talking about? LOL
<Barry> that's British cider
<Barry> maybe
<prince-dari> I thought that was the cider everyone drank? :P
<prince-dari> You guys don't drink cider?
<prince-dari> Wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
<Barry> but even if that's true throughout the world, it's not enough alcohol to cause any form of drunken state
<Ray> 02death.mp3
<prince-dari> Of course it is... O_o
<Barry> 2% to 8.5% is miniscule
<Barry> even kids can drink it
<Barry> legally
<prince-dari> LOL
<prince-dari> That's completely wrong.
<Barry> oh?
<prince-dari> 2L of perry is 9 units.
<Barry> either way, doesn't the government realize that the only way to at least reduce the amount of underage drinking is to make ubderage drinking legal?
<Barry> underage*
<Barry> where did that come from?
<prince-dari> I didn't even think it was illegal here, it's illegal for to sell alcahol to someone under 18 here.
<Barry> I really went on a tangent there
<prince-dari> -for*
<prince-dari> But to drink it? I think it's legal as long as it's not in public.
<Barry> hm
<prince-dari> Ah, there we go.
<prince-dari> According to some person:
<prince-dari> "Yes. You're allowed to drink from the age of 5 supervised by a parent or guardian. The reason it's supervised is because the parents are supposed to know better and give their child a limit, they are not supposed to allow her to get wasted but it's not a legal matter if it's in their own home, it's just looked down on by society."
<Barry> what do you think about the gun policy?
<prince-dari> In the US?
<Barry> yes
<prince-dari> I don't really know anything about it.
<Barry> Alright, who here is from the US?
<Barry> @pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12Barry is 7Ste6ven Mag7net
<prince-dari> So cider is a non-alcoholic drink in the US?
<prince-dari> LOL. Wow.
<Barry> I'm not sure now
<prince-dari> "During colonial times apple cider was consumed as the main beverage with meals because water was often unsafe for drinking. Ciderkin, a slightly alcoholic beverage made from cider pomace, could also be found on colonial tables.
<prince-dari> Sometime after Prohibition the word cider came to mean unfiltered, unfermented apple juice. In current U.S. usage the term is used for both fresh-pressed juice and fermented products, although the latter are often called hard cider. Apple juice, meanwhile, refers to a clear, filtered, pasteurized apple product.[42]
<prince-dari> "
<prince-dari> According to wiki.
<prince-dari> "The United Kingdom has the highest per capita consumption of cider, as well as the largest cider-producing companies in the world"
<Barry> It's also more dangerous to drink cider instead of pasteurized juice
<Barry> The greater possibility of pathogens in the drink
<Barry> at least it was in the old days, not sure about in the 21 century
<RDash> Oh, I'm from the US
<RDash> Apple Cider is definately not alcoholic lol
<RDash> I've heard of hard cider though
<prince-dari> I can't believe you guys don't have cider.
<prince-dari> Apple cider is alcoholic here. :P
<RDash> Haha, I never knew that
<Barry> Hey, RDash, what do you think of the gun policy?
<D_man> >wat
<prince-dari> Hey D_man, Americans don't have cider. O_______o
<D_man> it logged me out saying my name was signed out or something
<D_man> prince-dari that explains so fucking much.
<RDash> Hmm, I don't really care either way, but they may as well be aloud because people can get them either way
<RDash> So if it becomes illegal, which it probably wont, most likely bad intentioned people will be the only ones to have them
<RDash> Mmm *real* apple cider http://www.guide4weightloss.com/images/apple-cider-vinegar.jpg
<prince-dari> MFW apple juice, not cider
<RDash> What? Apple juice is clearer
<prince-dari> Wiki has a picture of real cider.
<RDash> http://www.ayushveda.com/womens-magazine/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/apple-juice.jpg
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> Clear apple juice.
<prince-dari> Cloudy apple juice.
<prince-dari> Not cider. :P
<D_man> prince-dari how comes the chat logged me out? btw
<prince-dari> I have no idea D_man.
<D_man> k
<RDash> because you've never had real cider before
<D_man> also whenever you name people it's impossibru to read haha
<RDash> :P
<D_man> Oh did you add any ponies?
<prince-dari> Pfft, calling apple juice 'real' cider.
<prince-dari> You crazy Americans. :P
<RDash> lol
<prince-dari> Not many, I got kind of distracted by a pony called Apple Cider. XD

<RDash> O.O That's a lot of apples
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<prince-dari> It doesn't tell you which names are fan names and which are canon on the wiki. >_>
<prince-dari> <_<
<Dman> prince-dari the reason Rainbow Dash is awesome is cuz her mane has colours like that, but I really like the other names, unless the ponies have particular hairstyles/looks, to just have the name in two / 3 colours
<Dman> Prince-dari
<Dman> sure does
<Dman> the onees in blue boxes
<Dman> =]
<Dman> ones with blue boxes are confirmed
<prince-dari> Ohhh.
<prince-dari> That makes sense.
<Dman> oki? :3
<prince-dari> Apple Cider isn't an official name. XD
<Dman> lol
<Dman> 'Official names are listed over a light blue background. ' y u no read the first line? haha
<SilverSonic> :3
<Dman> 'This is a list of ponies that don't appear in the characters page. Official names are listed over a light blue background. The names are mentioned in the show, Hasbro's toy line, or stated by the show's crew. The rest are given unofficial names by the fans, based on their cutie marks, behaviors, attributes and similarity to older generation ponies.'
<RDash> I wonder which drink the person that named Cider is thinking of? XD
<Roarart> YAY
<prince-dari> I've never heard of cider as a non-alcoholic drink before, I'm surprised. Is it not very big in America?
<RDash> It's HUGE in America
<RDash> Especially around Thanksgiving
<RDash> You've heard of that, right?
<RDash> October
<prince-dari> I've heard of it, yeah.
<prince-dari> The time when you guys all eat turkies? :P
<RDash> Yes! :D
<prince-dari> 12bo13on8-bon
<prince-dari> ...
<prince-dari> >_>
<Dman> Well
<prince-dari> 12bo13n-8bon
<Dman> the colours are
<Dman> um
<RDash> So, if you've never had cider...that mean's that you've never had cider doughnuts?
<prince-dari> That's as close as the colours gets.
<prince-dari> get*
<Dman> are you looking at the bonbon i'm looking at?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL @ the post office
<Dman> use white, blue and pink
<RDash> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03I go to mail that wi-fi adapter for Pattyrick
<Dman> mfw exact same pic opened up in other tab xP
<drfsupercenter> 03and the guy's like "You know someone in the Navy?" and I was like "yeah... just curious, how long would this take to get there?" and he's like "I dunno, depends on how fast the ship's going"
<drfsupercenter> 03I was like LOL
<prince-dari> I'm using blue, pink, and yellow.
<prince-dari> Yellow is closer to the fur colour than white.
<Dman> but you could use white for 2 letters, then blue 2 letters, then pink 2 letters
<Dman> Or yellow blue pink
<prince-dari> And you can't even see white unless you have a black background.
<RDash> Is there a lighter yellow to choose from?
<Dman> ok ok
<prince-dari> No.
<Dman> yellow blue pink
<prince-dari> That's the only yellow.
<Dman> 2 letters each?
<RDash> :/
<prince-dari> I'm using the darkest blue available.
<Dman> yellow BO /yellow pink N B /pink blue ON /blue
<prince-dari> And the pink is perfect.
<Dman> try that out prince-dari ^_^
<RDash> ^ that smiley isnt even close to the text : /
<prince-dari> Yellow pink N B?
<prince-dari> Wut
<Dman> first 2 letters yellow, next two blue, next two pink
<Dman> would be sick

<Barry1> Hi
<RDash> Hi barry1
<Barry1> Before you call be an impostor, Barry1 and Barry are one and the same
<RDash> I can tell ;)
<Barry1> My brother's on one computer, and I forgot to log out of there, so here I am
<RDash> haha, well your brother's a brony right?
<Barry1> anyway, what do you guys think about this story idea: We've all seen stories where Rainbow Dash has an accident and breaks one, or both wings, but what if instead of breaking a wing, it's severed?
<RDash> Like in Cupcakes :O Sounds good!
<Barry1> It would be a training accident
<ValtheJean> yes...."accident"
<RDash> ^
<Dman> Barry1 ;_________________________________________________________;
<Dman> aniways i'm still afk rite now : P
<Barry1> You know it doesn't take much speed to lose a limb
<Barry1> 50 or 60 MPH
<RDash> Dman aren't you out to dinner? haha
<ValtheJean> yes my pretties....soon Caramel will be the most popular pony....just have to get rid of the contenders...
<Barry1> @pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12Barry1 is 12Soar1in'
<RDash> Barry1 She goes plenty fast
<Barry1> I know, upwards of 700 MPH at full speed
<Barry1> Hit a tree or a pole with a wing at that speed, the wing will come right off
<Barry1> whether or not it can be reattached is the question I need to answer
<RDash> Yea, she goes at least 768 mph = sound barrier
<Barry1> @pony y secret lover
<Steven_Magnet> 6 y secret lover is 7G5ild15a
<Barry1> I meant to say "My"
<RDash> But when she does break it, she gains more speed
<RDash> @pony My secret lover
<Steven_Magnet> 6 My secret lover is 2The 8Wonder2bolts
<Barry1> the stupid "M" key sticks
<Barry1> yeah
<Barry1> 769+
<ValtheJean> HEY STEVEN
<ValtheJean> BITCH, THE WONDERBOLTS ARE MINE
<Barry1> he's a bot
<ValtheJean> I WEEL CUUUUT YUUUU
<ValtheJean> I know :P
<RDash> NO! I'm RDash!
<RDash> They're mine
<ValtheJean> HE TOLD ME THIS MORNING
<Barry1> @pony ValtheJean's secret lover
<Steven_Magnet> 6 ValtheJean's secret lover is 2Princess L10una
<RDash> grr
<ValtheJean> huh
<ValtheJean> I can live with that
<SilverSonic> LOL @ the |WTFghost bit XD
<ValtheJean> though I'd prefer Caramel :P
<Barry1> @pony Soipony's secret lover
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Soipony's secret lover is 5Snai10ls
<Pattyrick> yup
<prince-dari> Caramel has no lines in the show, why you love him so much? :P
<SoiPony> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<RDash> Probably from the fics, there are hundreda
<ValtheJean> because HE'S MOTHER FUCKING CARAMEL
<Pattyrick> bad IC is one of those little issues here in Italy
<ValtheJean> actually, I never read pony fics :P
<RDash> hundreds* 90% in which he's gay lol
<ValtheJean> O_o
<RDash> *gasp*
<ValtheJean> you take that the FUCK back!
<prince-dari> I don't read fics either.
<Barry1> @pony Prince-Dari's secret lover
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Prince-Dari's secret lover is 7Brae8burn
<ValtheJean> but no- I work every day to try and get my interpretation of Caramel as fanon
<prince-dari> I still know he's always shipped with Big Mac though. XD
<ValtheJean> one day Caramel...one day
<ValtheJean> DAMN YOU BRONIES.....DAMN YOUUUUUUUUUU!
<Barry1> Aren't Big Mac and Caramel cousins?
<prince-dari> What is your interpretation of Caramel?
<ValtheJean> no
<ValtheJean> ohherewego.jpg :P
<ValtheJean> alrighty
<ValtheJean> so first off
<RDash> I've read a few. Not a huge enthusiast though. Past Sins is great
<ValtheJean> HE DIDN'T GET A SEX CHANGE YOU COLTCUDDLERS
<Barry1> I know braeburn is an apple cousin
<prince-dari> Sex change?
<prince-dari> Wut
<ValtheJean> oh boy
<ValtheJean> okay
<ValtheJean> so
<Barry1> One of the pictures of Caramel is with a mare's body
<ValtheJean> watch Winter Wrap Up, pay close attention to Caramel's design
<ValtheJean> then watch Over a Barrel
<ValtheJean> basically:
<ValtheJean> there's a female pony with the exact same cutie mark/looks as Caramel
<Pattyrick> wb Rora
<ValtheJean> and thus he was known as sex-change pony
<ValtheJean> THESE ARE LIES
<prince-dari> Oh.
<ValtheJean> SPREAD BY CARAMEL HATERS
<ValtheJean> IT'S HIS TWIN SISTER
<ValtheJean> (only now realized that I am bat-shit insane)
<ValtheJean> but yes...back to Caramel
<ValtheJean> so: now that we've established he's a twin
<ValtheJean> I like to think his last name is Cake (Caramel Cake). The forsaken child of Mr. and Mrs. Cake
<ValtheJean> basically, since his cutie mark is three horseshoes (which I interpret as blacksmithing) he's been disowned by his parents
<Barry1> nice backstory
<ValtheJean> :P
<RDash> lol
<ValtheJean> but there's more!
<ValtheJean> so his sister
<Espeon> 06Roarawr
<ValtheJean> why does she have the same cutie mark?
<RDash> http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110630190056/mlp/images/4/45/Female_caramel.png
<ValtheJean> well, I'm reminded of a particular comic (wish I weren't on my work machine so I could link it)
<ValtheJean> basically, female caramel comes in and starts flirting with Big Mac, talking about "the operation"
<ValtheJean> said joke causes Big Mac to faint, and then Male Caramel gets angry at female caramel
<ValtheJean> and thus the idea was born:
<ValtheJean> she is a complete troll
<ValtheJean> who enjoys nothing more than trolling her poor twin brother
<Aurora> !Espeon
*Espeon now belongs to Aurora for 6 minutes
<HSX> 04Eons
<ValtheJean> thus the cutie mark: representative of her first time impersonating Caramel :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Lageons
<Seychelles> eh
<HyperMetalLugia> Lolnice
<RDash> For reference: http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/128/606/df12dd5855e0ff85c371b556f7672007.jpg?1306808676
<ValtheJean> yes! that's it!
<ValtheJean> You are now 20% cooler RDash :P
<RDash> :D
<ValtheJean> and then one final bit that I wish to push on the fandom:
<ValtheJean> So Caramel is one of the boys who pulls the carriage in best night ever
<prince-dari> INB4 I ruin your stor with:
<prince-dari> "Caramel's cutie mark isn't the three horseshoes. If you look closely when he's walking with Big Mac in Winter Wrap Up you can see what looks like the top of a caramel apple on his flank above his bag."
<prince-dari> :P
<prince-dari> story*
<ValtheJean> O_o

<ValtheJean> that's my explanation and I'm sticking to it :P
<drfsupercenter> 03god, editing music can be annoying sometimes
<RDash> That may be a fan pic though
<drfsupercenter> 03but I'm trying to (Finally) make a clean version of Green Day's AMerican Idiot album
<ValtheJean> no, that's in the episode
<drfsupercenter> 03only some of the songs have radio versions
<ValtheJean> it's just another animator inconsistency
<RDash> hmm
<ValtheJean> since he's ALWAYS (except for that one instance) had horshoes
<ValtheJean> horseshoes*
<ValtheJean> oh yeah, also
