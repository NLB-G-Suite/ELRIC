<ThundercrackerMLP> I <3 the Gladiator
<ThundercrackerMLP> Sign my float! Sign my float!
<langbard> I guess the chant says sabaton
<CCharmanderK> To me, Gladiator is one of Ridley Scott's weaker films. Not bad, but below par for a man of his genius.
<ekips> I have watched exactly one scene of Gladiator
<CTHULHU> its ok
<ekips> so I'm eager to see it tonight or tomorrow
<Triple> its wierd i never saw the avangers.
<LadyCanary> PRIMO VICTORIA
<Everlasting_Joy> This song <3.

<Triple> lol
<CCharmanderK> I much prefer Alien, Blade Runner: Final Cut and Thelma & Louise.
<CTHULHU> more POWER!
<pony_362> is here a marathon ?
<CCharmanderK> Tjose are Ridley Scott's best.
<CCharmanderK> *Those
<cachi01|phone> CCharmanderK indeed.
<Wrek> 05pony_362: not yet, right now its concerto hour(s)
<CCharmanderK> I just find Gladiator to be overrated action fluff.
<CCharmanderK> Not that there's anything wrong with action fluff. It's why I love the Transformers films.
<pony_362> im fine with concerts,too^^
<cachi01|phone> Alien...... We all loved alien until they fucked up with the weird shitty sequels
<Yahooz> ...
<cachi01|phone> Alien and aliens are good
<ekips> cachi01|phone come on, they are not so bad...
<Agemo> aliens is good :)
<CCharmanderK> I don't know. Aliens was pretty damn good.

<Wrek> 05"honored those, whom honored should"

<CCharmanderK> twilight_sprinkle: Nice way of fooling the censor.
<Purple`Prose> You know, I love Sabaton, but seriously, how many songs can you make about WWII?
<jcelios> Bilderbergs, Skull and Bones, Masons etc. etc.
<Kandarihu> I'm watching some MST3K. I gotta keep in mind that it's not on the stream.
<gdlk_ouo> dat rd
<Everlasting_Joy> He looks like he's having so much fun :).
<LadyCanary> <3
<Record_Discord> Woah CTHULHU, no r34 here, even if it's "clean"
<LadyCanary> They always do Everlasting_Joy :3
<cowvarkian> >.>
<CCharmanderK> It's a rock concert. They are required to have fun by law.
<Everlasting_Joy> LadyCanary: True, true :).
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Is someone posting ponies while Mods are AWAKE? :[
<LadyCanary> Metal :|
<cowvarkian> of course
<Meanwhile> Record_Discord: I don't think you understand what r34 is.
<Wrek> 05not all their songs are about WWII
<Wrek> 05in fact
<Wrek> 05latest album is about 1600's sweden
<Record_Discord> Meanwhile: Don't talk to me about rule 34. I KNOW ABOUT RULE 34
<cowvarkian> what else
<GoldenMic> who is this...?
<Record_Discord> Meanwhile: I just mean suggestive
<LadyCanary> Sabaton :3
<Purple`Prose> Shocking
<Scoot-Scootaloo> Meanwhile, let him have his fun~
<Meanwhile> Record_Discord: It can't really be r34 and 'clean'
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: You weren't kidding when you said these guys are the best way to learn about history.
<Record_Discord> Meanwhile: BUT IT CAN
<LadyCanary> GAAAAAAY Division~
<CCharmanderK> If you wanna see a really energetic rock band concert, watch any given concert with JAM Project. Masaaki Endoh, Hironobu Kageyama and Ricardo Cruz actually compete on stage to see who can be the hammiest.
<langbard> sabaton is the best swedish band. of course there's better bands in the neighbouring countries
<langbard> but still rather good
<Meanwhile> Record_Discord: But...not really.
<Purple`Prose> JAM Project is made of hot-blood and animes
<cowvarkian> Record_Discord: r34 = porn.... so no

<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Socks! :)
<cowvarkian> like, people who shoot old guys, or old guys who are shooters?
<CCharmanderK> Socks: Have you played Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition. I like squishing the aliens underneath dorrs and watching them stretch.
<twilight_sprinkle> Socks: dunno how old you're talking, but counter-strike 1.6 is one of the classics
<Record_Discord> CCharmanderK: I haven't tried that yet, but I've got the game
<Socks> cowvarkian: I mean the games, Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament that sort of thing, they have a real charm to them
<Dark_Horst> looks like ladycanary is enjoying this concert
<LadyCanary> WREK. Chris and Thobbe singing just made my day
<CCharmanderK> Record_Discord: It's fantastic.
<cowvarkian> Socks: I know, just the way you phrased it made it fun
<Record_Discord> CCharmanderK: That it is.
<cowvarkian> to make fun of
<Socks> :P
<Wrek> 05Socks: i dare you to beat all the original doom wads on ultraviolence withotu strafign ;)

<LadyCanary> YAAAAAAAAY
<Socks> Yeah yeah I'm a bad gamer ¬_¬
*Socks feels bad for himself
<CCharmanderK> Well, at least it isn't Nightmare mode.
<Dark_Horst> gaming is a learnable skill
*Record_Discord feels bad for socks
*cowvarkian feels bad for Record_Discord
<Dark_Horst> that's one big lighter
<Barbetos|AtWork> Sing light satan and carry a big lighter.
<CCharmanderK> Nightmare mode is literally impossible.
<LadyCanary> That means 2 things :3
<Barbetos|AtWork> like*
*Record_Discord feels bad for cowvarkian
<Purple`Prose> Grassenmetal
<Wrek> 05nightmare mode is unbeatable in the mean that you cant beat it in the same manner as you would other difficulties
<Wrek> 05onyl way to beat it is to rush it
<CCharmanderK> Wrek: And even then, it's only through miracle that you'd reach the end of level one.
<Socks> My dad used to play doom but then my mum made him stop after I was born :P
<cowvarkian> hah

<Socks> CCharmanderK: Hey I love my mum!
<Socks> Record_Discord: I'll check it out
<Record_Discord> Socks: It DEFINED my childhood and made me love FPSs.
<CCharmanderK> My dad raised me on stuff like Tremors, Terminator and Species 2.

<Dark_Horst> Sabaton
<Record_Discord> CCharmanderK: Tremors! The bacon...
<Purple`Prose> Get off the ground!

<TheGentleManBrony> U know the people of Iran actually like the USA. Its just the govt that is made of assholes.
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: i see what you did there
<Dark_Horst> hehe... "log"
<twilight_sprinkle> TheGentleManBrony: almsot all governments are
<Kandarihu> Well, I'm back from MST3K
<Kandarihu> TheGentleManBrony, I'm totally aware of that.
<TheGentleManBrony> Kandarihu it seems you're the only one.
<TheGentleManBrony> Or I just haven't looked hard enough.
<TheGentleManBrony> Idk
<Dark_Horst> i read that iranians are pretty pissed with their government
<Suzano> Sumica I cant quite draw your kirt properly XD i drew you to short of your mini will be a ultra micro XDDDD
<Dark_Horst> their latest stunt: banned battlenet ips
<Buytoast> ha
<Buytoast> that mouse
<TheGentleManBrony> On a similar note, I'm really hoping that not all Arabs are intolerant sexist assholes.
<Scootsy_Pie>
<Kandarihu> I've heard about the hyperinflation protests. I swear, the day the Ayatollah goes down will be a new beginning for Iran.
<Dark_Horst> well, one of the reasons battlenet got banned is bacause wow promoted slutty outfits and immoral depictions of females
<Vordox> <---- Yet USa wants to f'ck over internet
<Dark_Horst> think about that one
<Vordox> :P
<Dark_Horst> so their government is, at least
<Suzano> longest APP add ever
<Dark_Horst> conservative maniacs in positions od power
<Dark_Horst> has the young generation pissed
<Twilight_Is_BestPony> what are we watching O.O
<TheGentleManBrony> Choo Choo Sucka? Does this guy think a balloon is a train?
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: actually just a few weeks ago usa's government voted against un's internet control regulation proposals, and voted unanimously
<Kandarihu> Take out their nuclear weapons program, and they'll still be waging proxy wars via terrorist groups. Take out the Ayatollah, and the nuclear weapons program can just be repurposed for the peaceful purposes they've been claiming it's for all along.
<Twilight_Is_BestPony> is this ANOTHER troll?
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Pffft. Voting
<Suzano> LOL
<TheGentleManBrony> twilight_sprinkle our government seems to oppose everything the UN says.
