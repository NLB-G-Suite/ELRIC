<Yahooz> alrighty, im starting bets, YGO:PoL for 3rd ever WMC? yes or no
<Bronysith> She is the daughter of princess celestia, is shipped with 3-4 different ponies, the main one being fancy pants, is best friends with the main six but is in constant b*tch battles with half of them all the time and is always the victim.
<GhostBuster_VDX> Zuxxez123: You missed OUT!
<OohShiny> cratorkid: but it could be in japanese with subs, that's what I was asking
<Lunar_Brony> g'night Colt_Brovakiin
<J_E_Smith71> You know what guys? The reason why Yu-Gi-Oh was in the lotto because MrBen just threw it in as a joke because he didn't think he'd ever win
<sonicandmario85> SOMEONE PUT ON GHOST NAPPA
<Tovler> 1/10 and only because of Yugioh Abridged. Without Abridged, it would be WMCd.
<Kinixys> Egon is best Ghostbuster.
<DerpStar> Bai Colt_Brovakiin

<XAX> otakon: i haven't actually seen it in a while. brb wiki

<otakon> J_E_Smith71: well he wasted his win
<The_Murky_One> RosePetal: You get...no medal. You only get a medal for avoiding the Pokemon anime growing up.
<pony_666> pols like 40min i think
<RosePetal> When there's 4Kids there's Dan Green.
<KaitoThePony> 8/10
<Dr_Fumbles> Must... risk life... for cards
<Yahooz> dat aint falco
<Dken2021> otakon you need a kick buster for those botkicks
<otakon> WHERE IS THE TROLLING BASTARD?
<SirGanjalf|Buster> We need more Blockbusters(hah!), like e.g. Blues Brothers
<cratorkid> OohShiny: oh, dont think so , even though i prefer sub anime over dub
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> wasn't talkin to you Meanwhile
<doctor_whooves127> abridged version
<GhostBuster_VDX> PLEASE

<SirGanjalf|Buster> *80's blockbusters
<RosePetal> Uh... I watched Pokemon when I was little but grew out of it.
<VenHur> Wombahz Comboodauuhhhz...
<otakon> XAX: still too long
<RosePetal> Sorry.
<ASoftFluffyThing> otakon, the kickbots are the "trolling bastards" you speak of
<RAWRity> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5duxoPTVZ1rncbeqo1_400.png
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Magic
<RAWRity> I am Paramedic. I used to be a part of the Royal family, but was disowned after he joined the Navy. I fought in the war as a Corpsman. After that, I founded the Wonderbolts. I was discharged after my CO found out who I was from Celestia. I was homeless for the longest time after that, until the Apple family took me in during the early part of Ponyville. Eventually, I made enough money to build a home. Then I built Ponyvi
<XAX> otakon: i guess.
<Meanwhile> You said it too me smartass.
<Bronysith> welp i think imma go play some RE4
<OohShiny> When I was little I watched Digimon
<otakon> ASoftFluffyThing: no MrBen for selection YGO: PoL
<Wirisme> what are the kicks for now?
<J_E_Smith71> otakon: |In fact he's never even seen the movie either
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: *to
<SirGanjalf|Buster> "Do you believe in magic?
<Lunar_Brony> IKR?
<cowvarkian> OohShiny: I watched that...
<RosePetal> I watched Digimon on Youtube.
<sonicdude558> maybe
<otakon> J_E_Smith71: THE FUCK!? WHY WOULD HE PICK IT THEN?!
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> Meanwhile I said it to fluttercry dumbass
<ASoftFluffyThing> otakon, oh. I thought you were talking about the kickbots
<TheDarkFreak> in a younng girls heart?
<otakon> WHERE ARE YOU MRBEN!?
<RosePetal> The Japanese version though.
<doctor_whooves127> whats magic he says it but what is it?
<sonicdude558> maybe SirGanjalf|Buster
<ASoftFluffyThing> otakon, My mistaaake ._.
<Jigglysaint> digimon
<fluttercry> 05,15what was said to me?
<steamer> hello every pony
<Dken2021> Wirisme they were made so we cam make fun of otakon and his short messages
<Jigglysaint> I head that movie was baaaad
<String_Shredder> SirGanjalf|Buster: In a young girl's heart
<OJ> The_Murky_One: Maybe. But it didn't have a full comedy cast. This movie had Ivan Reitman directing and a full cast of SNL/Second City veterans. It easily could have been just another summer blockbuster. But the writing and tone make it easily believable as a horror or action movie. But it is still a comedy at heart
<otakon> I WANT TO STRANGLE YOU YOU GODDAMN TROLLING BASTARD!
<cratorkid> OohShiny: dub voice acting sounds forced and rushed, kinda f'd up , even some of the better dubs , like haruhi and rosario and d. gray
<TheDarkFreak> digimon, now there's a nostalgia trip
<Yahooz> MrBen is the new Simon
<sonicdude558> hi streamer, you misses a whole lot
<J_E_Smith71> otakon: Again he didn't think it'd win so he just threw something in the lotto for the hell of it
<Meanwhile> Oh hey you're right, I'm sorry Ish it was T.
<Yahooz> >:3
<doctor_whooves127> hey digimon hey digimon
<Wirisme> lol

<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> wrong yu-gi-oh film, when you said cardgames on motorcycles
<otakon> ARRRRRRGHHHHHHHHH

<otakon> Seriously tell me it's not just me but the animation in this ep is GREAT
<Gold_Demona> Om nom nom!
<steamer> luke you must use the horse
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> spanish word for no
<cowvarkian> DocSane: yes
<RAWRity> Qui
<AlienWarhead> The_Murky_One I usually don't try to find books I just run across them way less than I did in Fallout 3 for some reason
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DocSane: Twilight?
<MrBen> I think I may have made a mistake swapping compouters
<SirGanjalf|Buster> I-E-H-O-V-A
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: it was pressed into the pillow
<Bjornfot> nej
<fluttercry> 05,15It was the best of times it was the worst of times
<pinkiepancake> docsane i think aj
<Wirisme> does Twilight count?
<MrBen> It's running slower than ever up here
<DocSane> I'm down to either Pinkie or RD.
<otakon> pony shaped
<Kinixys> Pony shaped dart pattern. XD
<Wirisme> because I think Twilight
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i guess, although a lot of stretchyt animation too i think
<weeping_pegasi82> when I saw this I was reminded of UHF
<Nightfall> Her voice is so amazing...
<Lunar_Brony> otakon wait, what?
<AlienWarhead> Step on the dovahkin symbol!
<Wirisme> AJ doesn't have the fancy mathematics
<magmablock> Or they're all mammals except the eagle
<Svettponny> Huh, never noticed Daring's voice was not RD's voice...
<cowvarkian> rats eat cockaroaches...
<OohShiny> RD is good at voice acting
<DocSane> Twilight cannot be the closest friend to herself.
<Sciaenops> I would've thought they're all mamals except the bird.
<cowvarkian> DocSane: sure she can
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> whatever language that is word for no
<Yagamilightisderpy> if that sweat had fallen into another board and activated the traps
<Wirisme> Future twilight is closest
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DocSane: Nvm, got what you said. Probably Pinkie PIe.
<otakon> Lunar_Brony: the animation in this ep is awesome PLUS there is a grain filter effect for the DD sequences which is ALSO awesome
<pony_9000> dadada
<The_Murky_One> AlienWarhead: They're in ... odd, out of the way places. But there ARE four of each before the extras in the DLC.
<weeping_pegasi82> UHF!!!!
<J_E_Smith71> Who said ponies can't play hopscotch?
<Svettponny> I assumed she would speak in RD's voice, as this is all technically all taking place in her head.
<RAWRity> Si
<Star_Shadow> cowvarkian Well I haven't seen it yet
<sonicdude558> And then interruption...
<steamer> anti climactic climax
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> spanish word for no
<pony_9000> oh just gran it
<Gold_Demona> cowvarkian: Cockroaches eat cockroaches. :P
<MrBen> And then she just takes it
<Purple`Prose> yoink
<pony_9000> grab
<SirGanjalf|Buster> welp, that was anti-climactic
<otakon> nom
<Ryunosuke> that scene reminds me of the opening of UHF
<fluttercry> 05,15...you mean no
<XAX> and then lava
<OohShiny> you should have put a rock in place
<DerpStar> Did anypony else see Daring doo as a monocromatic RD?

<otakon> welp THAT is not good
<steamer> yeah
<cowvarkian> DerpStar: yes

<Ninjazz|Away> IshBlueEyesWhitePony, but did he destroy the reserves?
<Meanwhile> How does 30 million dollars of maple syrup even exist!
<EspyLacopa> Meanwhile: Well obviously, their maple syrup is dangerously deliciousw.
<otakon> lol
<Amu-chan> If I had a child who played hockey, I would never make them wear such a hideous helmet as that previous one I linked to.
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> Ninjazz|Away pretty sure it was all of Canada
<Sumica> 00,10So yeah lotto time again, even had a news letter again this week
<RAWRity> I think it was Pinkie Pie who stole it.
<otakon> in warehouses obviously
<Shizuka> 13wooo

<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> I told you guys, it was me and my pancake loving goons

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03an MLG newsletter~
<Ninjazz|Away> IshBlueEyesWhitePony, knowing cananda, it was in the Royal Canadian underground vault.
<Meanwhile> How much maple syrup constitutes 30 million dollars worth.
<RAWRity> 1 drop
<Sumica> 00,10this week we had 129 votes, some had to be cut because people dont check the front page for what movies are not viuable for one reason or another.
<EspyLacopa> Well, if each pound is worth say, 3 dollars. . . That's 10 million pounds
<fluttercry> 05,15Please do that this week. We don't like marking out votes
<Nittany_Discord> Remember, check our past movies to see if your selection has been shown in the last 6 months before you submit.
<Sumica> 00,10first up we have number 11 CrimsonPhoenix with "The King's Speech"
<Meanwhile> It was like 500,000 grams apparently.
<otakon> godddammit
<otakon> The King's Speech?
<otakon> REally?
<Shizuka> 13mmm oscar bait
<Amu-chan> Apparently there's a high demand for pink helmets. http://www.hockeymonkey.com/ccm-hockey-helmet-ht04-combo-pink.html
<fluttercry> 05,15indeed

<RAWRity> ah yes, the story of boring people doing boring things.
<otakon> it was last year
<fluttercry> 05,152010
<Meanwhile> That's gonna be fun.
<RAWRity> it's definitely an A movie.
<Cades> haha
<fluttercry> 05,15won best picture
<Shizuka> 13kk
<otakon> it's ineligible due to being too new still
<RAWRity> just not an entertaining A movie
<Sumica> 00,10sounds like an A
<Amu-chan> And gloves... http://www.hockeymonkey.com/ccm-hockey-gloves-uplus-06-sr-pink.html

<EspyLacopa> Huh.
<Ninjazz|Away> And hopes and dreams were crushed.
<otakon> only way this could get good is if Dead Alive is B
<Amu-chan> But not hideous fur gloves. http://www.hockeymonkey.com/rinky-hockey-fur-glove.html
<RAWRity> inb4 Titanic 2 for B
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> fluttercry rigg the vote so Interstella gets b

<Ninjazz|Away> TOOOOOOO RECEEEEEEEEENT.
<otakon> it's not eligible
<otakon> You watch Movie Bob too Shizuka?
<Sumica> 00,10number 17 Randomiser with "Powerpuff Girls Movie"

<Ninjazz|Away> Lol.
<RAWRity> yes
<otakon> and then RAWRity came
<Amu-chan> Apparently they get high ratings, though.
<Meanwhile> The Powerpuff Girls movie. Well, that's going to be interesting.
<otakon> ^
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> PPG seriously ?
<Cades> Did you see that goaltender that cut his neck get by someones skate he was bleeding all over the ice?
<Yahooz> lol and RAWRity wasnt kciked
<otakon> so one really DRY movie
<Yahooz> *kicked

<otakon> and then one fairly funny movie
<Sumica> 00,10movie on to ponies
<otakon> it evens out I guess
<EspyLacopa> It had lots of monkeys.
<Meanwhile> Inb4 pony eps are Lesson Zero and Sonic Rainboom.
<RAWRity> srsly, PPG is fucking awesome.
<otakon> yes it is
<otakon> that's why I want to see Hotel Transylvania
<Shizuka> 13lesson zero isn't eligible
<fluttercry> 05,15bleh...next week
<Cades> lol that's a well constructed sentence right there
<Shizuka> 13it's out of the list
<RAWRity> like, it's one of the best Super Hero movies I've ever seen. No joke.
<otakon> it's got Genndy Tartakovsky directing it
<Meanwhile> Inb4 pony eps are Luna Eclipsed and Sonic Rainboom.
<otakon> I want to support his work
<Sumica> 00,10Number 94 Tovler with zomg finaly "Dragon quest"
<Yahooz> My choice was first on the list bra
<otakon> unlike goddamn CN with their stupid bullshit
<Meanwhile> Dragon Quest. Meh.
<EspyLacopa> Ha, Dragon Ques
<Amu-chan> No, but that sounds quite nasty...
<DashWithRainbows> Woah, been a long time since that's been here.
<RAWRity> otakon: i want to too, but I'm not going to see Hotel Transylvania because fuck Adam Sandler
<otakon> WHY YOU FUCKERS CANCEL SYBIONIC TITAN?
<Yahooz> we need some Cider love
<Sumica> 00,10not sence we showed it live
<RAWRity> otakon: low toy sales
<otakon> RAWRity: but THERE WERE NO TOYS
<RAWRity> otakon: there were. and they didn't sell.
<otakon> that's why Fuck CN in that case
<EspyLacopa> So they'd be really really low, huh?
<Sumica> 00,10and finaly number 110 KaitoThePony with "sonic rainboom"
<Meanwhile> HAH
<Meanwhile> HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<DashWithRainbows> Good to see we'll be getting every episode instead of the gosh darn same few...
<Yahooz> OF COURSE
<Meanwhile> SONIC RAINBOOM
<Sumica> 00,10glad we wont be seeing that one for a long time
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> that reminds me, any news on the season 3 premiere yet?
<DashWithRainbows> Yep.
<BaconMane> 0,5God damnit
<Cades> you wanna see it?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I picked Sonic Rainboom this week.
<RAWRity> IshBlueEyesWhitePony: november. that's all we know
<Amu-chan> No.
<Meanwhile> Fucking called it.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile can see the future
<Yahooz> so an underaired ep, and an overaired ep. brilliant
<Cades> haha ok
<Sumica> 00,10You fail
<Ninjazz|Away> And even still with the new measures in place, we get Sonic Rainboom.
<BaconMane> 0,5My aunt brought my little cousins over unannounced and I missed god damn half of ghgostbusters!
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> but it was suppossed to be this or last month :(
<RAWRity> hey, at least it's not Zero or Luna.
<DashWithRainbows> Best to get it out of the way, I suppose.
<Meanwhile> True.
<Sumica> 00,10looks like that is it for the lotto. Supprisingly easy today.
<Meanwhile> Rainboom is like the second least aired most aired ep.
<Ninjazz|Away> Bleh. Still seen it too many times. :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01BaconMane: At least you don't have to clean gutter out tomorrow likely during EBMN.
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when SONIC RAINBOOM. AGAIN?
<Cades> Someone in the comments said the surgeon who operated on his neck said he was 20 seconds away from dying :o
<Yahooz> Where was Gondor when Meanwhile fucking called Sonic Rainboom
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Whoo hoo! Two of my most favorite movies of all time!
<Barbetos> My Little Rainbow Dash, and some other ponies.
<BaconMane> 0,5:/
<Lunar_Brony> YESH
<BaconMane> 0,5What movie is up next?
<Jigglysaint> what movies were picked?
<ROHKARA> I think I should have been more specific with my A movie
<Lunar_Brony> I can SPEAK!!!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Yu-Gi-Oh
<DerpyMuffins> PPG movie@
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Curses, foiled again!
<Ninjazz|Away> Yu Gi OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH.
<Sciaenops> *plays Secret of the Magic Crystals whilst watching stream*
<Yahooz> Pyramid of Light
<Buytoast> but sonic rainboom is terrible
<steamer> owl, evryone is fond of owls
<Dken2021> and thus we end the repetitive votes with sonic rainboom, for the last time
<J_E_Smith71> Well it's the final time in the episode cycle we'll be seeing that
<Shizuka> 13what time is it
<Yahooz> inb4 WMC n7umbah 3
<DerpStar> Whats B movie again dearies?

<IcY_> ahh not liking any of that
<fluttercry> 05,15Have no fear. Sonic Rainboom is now out for months
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> with onions
<pony_9000> :P
<Wirisme> PPG movie
<J_E_Smith71> Dken2021: At least till next year
<RAWRity> but yeah, King's Speech is a snoozer, PPG movie is awesome, Dragon Quest is one of the best eps of Season 2, and Sonic Rainboom is a thing that happened.
<Meanwhile> It's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-duel!
<Buytoast> this is a dark day indeed
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> fwiw I completely forgot Dragon quest was a thing.
<MrBen> Huttah!

<Yahooz> ofc
<KaitoThePony> Here is a pic for me getting in the lottery http://kaitothepony.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d5h024j
<Wirisme> Dragon quest is not on my favourites
<Sumica> 00,10at least till some time next year fluttercry
<MrBen> I AM SO GLAD DRAGON QUEST FINALLY WON

<DerpStar> Ok off for a bit will be back ummm when we're done over here ;)
<Sylandest> and terror
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> The first few months of BMN I won the B movie choice 3 times, and never since then. I smell a conspiracy!
<Spazturtle> Sumica: Is there somthing wrong with the stream audio? The intermission sounds crackerly
<bashful> can't wait to watch the Power puff girls next week:)
<KaitoThePony> I wonder if Jackass 3 will ever be on here
<Wirisme> Sonic Rainboom's a good episode though, even if it's overplayed
<J_E_Smith71> Sumica fluttercry: What's the ETA for when we're done with the current ep cycle? I tried to count and it'll probably be March. Maybe first week of April when all the eps and Season3 will be available again
<DocSane> I just want to win once.
<Spazturtle> Anyone else got crackerly audio?
<sonicandmario85> me
<Rex_Ivan> anyone know what this song medely is
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://iambrony.steeph.tp-radio.de/mlp/gif/pinkieblastof.gif My reaction on this weeks Lottery

<Lunar_Brony> KaitoThePony . . . remind me to request that
<RAWRity> Don't ya wish your girlfriend was hot like me
<XAX> Spazturtle: It might be the song, not the stream audio in general.

<CrimsonPhoenix> it looked interesting
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so much
<Star_Shadow> Lord smoothies
<Lunar_Brony> fluttercry if there are 52 episodes, then that means 26 BMN's will be played until Sonic Rainboom is eligible. That's about 6 1/2 months
<Meanwhile> I bet I can tell what that is without looking.
<Lunar_Brony> fluttercry you were close
<RAWRity> so Meanwhile admits trixie is his gf.
<Kurra> Okay so
<RAWRity> good to know.
<fluttercry> 05,15Thank you for calculating that for me
<Lunar_Brony> np
<Meanwhile> I do not. Shaddup.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lunar_Brony, that is until seasons 3 starts
<Kurra> Today I met a brony at work and hoofbumped and pony-geeked with them X3
<Gold_Demona> Is the chat out of silent mode now?
<EspyLacopa> No, 26 weeks is about 6 months.
<Gold_Demona> Guess so. :3
<taoumi> CrimsonPhoenix: http://imgur.com/ZPBzx i swear. it's not what it looks like
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Kurra: nice. :)

<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Oh Derpy...
<Dken2021> Kurra excellent

<Meanwhile> Inb4 that one screen cap.
<Kurra> just wondering if they're in channel, they had a bawss Twilight science shirt on X3
<Eulshy> I cant watch next week anyway, so i'll hope for mine next time
<Kurra> XDDDDDDDDDDDD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so who is ready for the duel ?

<CrimsonPhoenix> taoumi, that's.....interesing
<Yahooz> which one?
<graywhoof> yesterday I was dragged into the most brony0friendly hot topic I've ever been in. The staff were friendly. :)
<J_E_Smith71> Maybe I counted wrong
<RAWRity> no motorcycles, so no.
<Gold_Demona> DERPDERPDERPDERP: Awesome! =D
<Kimori> lol..
<Lunar_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix I haven't been around long enough to know how BMN and the new episodes work together, so I can't really say anything for or against that
<Meanwhile> Card games in pyramids.
<taoumi> trying to do a little clean up CrimsonPhoenix :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wait no motorcycles ?
<cratorkid> does anyone else eat everything w/ chopsticks?
<AlienWarhead> Lunar_Brony Objection we never have Season 2 episode 25 or 26 during movie nights so the episode number is 50 here
<CrimsonPhoenix> taoumi, sounds good
<Wirisme> no

<Barbetos> Oh look Tara Sands has a role in this movie. Sounds familiar...
<RAWRity> still, this movie will still be better than Yu-Gi-Oh ZeXal
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Dark92Enigma: Why?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but think about the children.... they need card games in motorcycles
<kidzrul434> I'm gonna go kill someone because i lost again
<DaringDerpy> good night bronies! :)
<LunasGuard> Dark92Enigma: why u cry
<Lunar_Brony> AlienWarhead perhaps it's because it never gets picked . . ?
*Dark92Enigma not because he lost the lottery, but because he missed GHOSTBUSTERS
<Lunar_Brony> g'night DaringDerpy

<LolipopOfDoom> You can't steal muffins, Nightmare Moon.
<Dken2021> night DaringDerpy
*Wirisme getting toast before part II
<J_E_Smith71> By the way fluttercry you guys have an even number of eps left right? You guys didn't already ban Luna Eclipsed, which would put you at an uneven number of eps?

<Svettponny> I've heard that the next movie is poop. I already have a hard time for anime in general, so maybe this would not be the best way to try to change my mind... Perhaps I should sit this one out.
<Yahooz> behold! no one gives a fuck
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Becuase they don't have card games on motorcycles children are filling that void with crappy beiber and twilight, only a few dollars a month can spare the life of a children by giving him card games on motorcycles
*LunasGuard drinks cider with everypony
<Darf14> 3 Minutes until we watch a childrens card game :)
<pony_9000> oh my god
<The_Murky_One> I don't know any, I haven't seen more than an ep or two of the abridged series.

<KaitoThePony> Lol less people said bye....But NVM I am staying

<sonicdude558> <_<
<Star_Shadow> enter setto kyba
<Spazturtle> No it doe
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica so, that means we're going to have a total of 65 in the rotation, which would bump the re-stream eligibility of Sonic Rainboom to approx. 8 months, but that also depends on how you're going to handle having an odd number of pony episodes. Either way, we won't see Sonic Rainboom until July.
<Ryunosuke> wait, what?
<DocSane> Um, yes it does.
<RosePetal2> It doesnt!
<Bloxx> Long ago, egyptians activated each others trap cards

<pony_666> bet your soul on a game of chance that may or maynot be fair
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> This show always confused me. People try and conquer the world... with a card game.

<AlienWarhead> SirGanjalf|Buster: Anubus Jackel head yes
<The_Si> An evil teacup?
<prince-dari> Did anyone play the PS1 yu-gi-oh game?
<Purple`Prose> Sooooo... they're just keeping an ancient apocalypse-causing item around?
<fluttercry> 05,15sounds stupid but it's totally real

<Dark92Enigma> otakon: blame......you know 4KIDS
<magmablock> That's no limo
<AlienWarhead> Eat my dust you losers
<Lunar_Brony> cowvarkian I have a book labelled "Egyptology". It's about Ancient Egypt and everything about it: a citizen's life style, their spiritual beliefs, medicine, farming, etc . . .

<FUS_RO_yay> Ah. Thanks for the 5 answers.
<Darf14> Top floor, must be a long movie to make it to the final bos-... never mind
<Rex_Ivan> MASTERS of comedy
<RosePetal2> Flashback.
<MrBen> At least this is only a 90 minute movie.
<somepony_else> how long....
<SirGanjalf|Buster> Sciaenops: Incest between ancient gods is in fact nothing that unusual
<cowvarkian> Lunar_Brony: ok... didn't I ask who disputed it? not "I dispute egyptology"?
<Kurra> Yugi must get such a ribcracking if he ever falls on his face.
<MrBen> We're already...what...halfway through?
<CrimsonPhoenix> YOU DON'T SAY
<RosePetal2> That's an hour.
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> RosePetal2: Worst of all it wasn't even 'good' toilet humor. That was about as lazy as you could possibly get.
<Sciaenops> But when they have hawk heads and dog heads, it's kinda strange.
<otakon> MrBen: eeyup
<OohShiny> dat voice
<bashful> split personality?
<Wirisme> what the fuck is going on
<AlienWarhead> but I'm sure card games are the answer
<otakon> Wirisme: no idea
<CrimsonPhoenix> This movie is only good because of Dan Green
<Bronysith> MURDER
<grayhoof> crazy
<OohShiny> bashful: that's his tulpa
<Darf14> Red, Yellow, and Blue, Just like the primary colors in art class
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DAT DAN GREEN
<Fenr> amnesia as the plot calls

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> YUGIOOOOOOOOOH
<Buytoast> YUGIOHH
<cowvarkian> Lunar_Brony: say doesnt exist
<CriticKitten> Purple`Prose: In the final arc of the story, when the ancient Egypt stuff happens, it's explained that Kaiba is obsessed with the Blue Eyes because the Blue Eyes represents a girl he had the hots for, basically. Egypt is fucking weird like that.
<XAX> O_O
<OohShiny> he turns into his tulpa!
<SirGanjalf|Buster> Sciaenops: Yeah, must be incest and zoophilia then, ugh
<RosePetal2> However Dan Green is good. Because he's Dan Green.

<Eulshy> KAIBA STOP STALKING THAT TEENAGER AND HARRASING HIM WITH CARD GAMES

<Reikim> I got a used copy so no card for me.
<CriticKitten> fluttercry: Pft, you dork. Kaiba's here, WMC is impossible.
<Lunar_Brony> Purple`Prose pfft, saftely
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> I really doubt this movie is bad because of 4kids. Let's face it, the concept is awful.
<CrimsonPhoenix> this is the biggest fun I've had in any BMN ever
<Tovler> 4kids' background music is too noisy and overwrought
<RosePetal2> Oh trust me Pegasus is fun.
<Ryunosuke> vagineer, any movie would be better without 4kids

<OohShiny> X-MEN DEFCON1!
<Vash> Yes, i do want my coat back
<Kurra> Just rip the damn card in half, and crash the game.
<XAX> weow
<SirGanjalf|Buster> CARD GAMES ARE SRS BZNS GUYS:O
<Barbetos> Finally these ass holes will be gone
<RosePetal2> DDDDDD DUEL.
<fluttercry> 05,15What happens if he doesn't duel
<Lunar_Brony> OJ safety hazard altogether, but this IS Yu Gi Oh . . .
<Buytoast> he dies
<fluttercry> 05,15Do they just there?
<otakon> personal AND personalized jet?
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> Spazturtle: Maybe, but I can't imagine the original is good. In fact it may be even more insane, chopping off legs with buzzsaws over card games...
<otakon> check
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: The plot doesn't advance.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and then there's a duel for the rest of the movie
<Barbetos> fluttercry yes
<XAX> fluttercry: one can not just not duel
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> fluttercry: Hours of awkward silence.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kids make this show stay popular?
<Tovler> the music never stops being "epic" and they never stop talking
<Crippler> dueling systems ONLINE.

<OohShiny> I summon fluttershy! She has over 9000 Cute Points!

<XAX> Nittany_Discord: I haven't watched a single episode in years. Neither the old or new serieseseses.
<Adjeca> agreed!
<Lunar_Brony> Nittany_Discord the show itself is really good actually.
<CriticKitten> ACTION LINES WHEN THEY DRAW, OMFG SHIT'S HEATING UP NOW
<Tovler> NO, If you attack Familar Knight, his effect will
<Ryunosuke> you dont have to attack
<Buytoast> there aint no breaks in the duel school
<Reikim> Gotta love how Kaiba has the financial ability to create a > Card deck reader that can jsut take a shuffled deck and read it > computer that analyzes all possible duel outcomes in a game that relies half on luck > a swanky lab to do it all in > a badass goddamn longcoat.
<IshBlueEyesWhitePony> Screw the rules, he has money
<Dark92Enigma> fluttercry: totally my point

<Dken2021> all three at once
<vagineer> oh man
<Darf14> all 3....err Kaiba, your strategy might work on a different planet, but the reality is that this is earth
<EspyLacopa> What about Ra's massive summoning chant?
<red_ony> all I hear is...blablablablabullshitblablabla
<Sciaenops> AND THEN EVERYONE DIED
<RosePetal2> THE POWER OF RA!

<fluttercry> 05,15GET OUT OF MY FACE MOVIE
<DocSane> Did they actually sell these little arm thingies for kids to wear?
<magmablock> And since Ra gets its power from its sacrifices, it's powerless
<Dken2021> Mega Ultra Chicken
<J_E_Smith71> IT's A TRAP.....CARD
<AlienWarhead> I summon Mega Ultra Scootaloo
<cowvarkian> DocSane: yes
<Tovler> YOU FOOL. Now Kaiba will use his Quincy powers to seal your Bankai!
<Bloxx> DocSane: They did, and I have one lol
<RosePetal2> HAHAHAHAHA.
<MrBen> "I'm sure on your planet that counts as some semblance of strategy..."
<otakon> yeah
<Biglaw> DERPDERPDERPDERP: Yugioh card monsters are based in different categories, such as Beast, Warrior, etc;
<Dark_Horst> that's like saying: hey, nice bazooka you got there, but imma force you to bring out your TANK and you BOMBER TOO! WHATCHA DO NOW, HUH???
<Kurra> Main bus A undervolt.... we have a main bus B undervolt....
<RAWRity> Yeah, Exodia sort of became meaningless when season 2 happened.
<Dken2021> DocSane yup, and all cosplayers rejoice
<otakon> but you auto win if you summon him
<RosePetal2> how?
<Darf14> Prepare to get ......uh.... get owned Kaiba :$
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> DocSane: Yes, yes they did. No holograms unfortunately. :(

<Sciaenops> OH GOD NOOOOOO NOT A CARD
<cowvarkian> my god.... a card
<Rookeealding> ... that's so much more.
<DocSane> A CARD?!
<Dark92Enigma> The rest of the movie, is pretty much this:
<XAX> FORGOT WHAT WAS ON MY CLIPBOARD
<Dark92Enigma> NOTHING
<K_A> SOME GUY MADE A CARD BASED ON IT!
<Dken2021> *note: you can't do this effect what's shown in the movie
<Dark92Enigma> BUT
<NoPonyEpic> It's a trading card as well :O
<Dark92Enigma> FIGHTING
<Sciaenops> And ten Seto's head falls off from the power.

<RAWRity> Yugi and Joey managed to get two of em back.
<CrimsonPhoenix> WELCOME TO THE SHADOW REALM
<Dr_Fumbles> Wtf is going on?
<CriticKitten> You know, there's one core flaw in Kaiba's strategy. He believes that by preventing Yugi from using the gods, he can defeat Yugi. The problem? YUGI ALREADY BEAT HIM IN THE PAST WITHOUT THE GODS.

<Dark92Enigma> why people think Yugi is the greatest duelist ever JUST BECAUSE OF THE GOD CARDS? Maybe the narrator from before forgot to mention that Yugi defeated Kaiba became King Of Games, by defeating none other than Pegasus to save his Grandpa! AND WITHOUT THE GODDAMN GOD CARDS! Yeah, forgot to tell us that, you jackass!
<Dr_Fumbles> LETS SCREAM SOME MORE!!!

<CrimsonPhoenix> SO DARK AND EDGY
<Biglaw> I got dat card
<Lunar_Brony> Sumica . . . damn spittake
<EspyLacopa> Nice hat.

<CrimsonPhoenix> cause Magic the gathering is a better card game
<Meanwhile> Turns out...you still suck.
<ASoftFluffyThing> fluttercry, don't tempt them. Then again I think there's a DnD movie, so....
<Meanwhile> STILL.
<Dken2021> fluttercry is MTG as complicated as this?

<Lunar_Brony> he has 200 life points left
<SirGanjalf|Buster> DERPDERPDERPDERP: Every next card is more OP than previous one!
<Buytoast> but seeing it drawn out like this
<red_ony> this is the worst thing I have seen in a long time..

<Lunar_Brony> RANDOM YU GI OH TRIVIA: the true effect Pyramid of Light actually allows you to special summon "Andro Sphinx" and "Sphinx Teleia" fromyour deck, but only by paying 500 life points for each summon. If "Pyramid of Light" is removed from the field while "Andro Shpinx" and "Sphinx Teleia" are in play, destroy and remove both cards from play.

The animation is amazing, but the plot is a complete mess, the dialogue is cliché, and it NEVER SHUTS THE FUCK UP! It’s just the same thing you’ll find in the show with the purpose of selling more products. No more, no less. It’s not horrible, but it’s still better than CARDGAMES ON MOTORCYCLES! 4,5/10

<Eulshy> Sexy Magician Cards/10
<Adjeca> the picture is very near showing both ends. 5'8" by the way
<Tovler> 1/10 WMC only because there's a chance it could be picked again for B movie. This movie is so fucking noisy. Knowing what all the cards did didn't help the movie for me.
<XAX> dis soundtrack.
<Meanwhile> Und dann rap number.
<EspyLacopa> And the manga. . .was surprisingly dark.

<Purple`Prose> Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that the best way to deal with gods, be they Lovecraftian Sumerian deities or would-be Egyptian lords of the dead, is to CHEAT YOUR ASS OFF! CHEAT CHEAT CHEATY CHEAT! Your faithful student, Purple Prose.
<CriticKitten> LOL at all the 1s. Lack of perspective much? This is hardly a 1/10. XD It's bad, yeah, I'd go close to 4/10, but get real. There's no way it's as bad as the stuff we usually watch.

<Thulu-tan> Except the giant robots look more like walking piles of scrap metal

<Kinixys> WMC?
<Barbetos> WMC? Wut?
<Shizuka> 13i've watched it many times and i'm not sure there were robots in it
<Reikim> You should try watching it again. On mute.

<CrimsonPhoenix> A LOT of people had a lot of fun in this
<Thulu-tan> It does nearly everything wrong

<Bloxx> Yeah, don't WMC this. It was funny
<pony_9000> its still friday yaaa
<Rookeealding> no.
<pony_666> its purly to try to revive the dead show
<AlienWarhead> WMC = worst movie clause
<otakon> Shizuka: can we get THIS movie WMC'd please?
<CriticKitten> To WMC this movie would be BEYOND just biased, it'd be downright stupid.
<Tovler> Is WMC because it could be picked again a good reason for WMC?
<Adjeca> currently on the front page of Reddit, that's where i saw it
<Meanwhile> otakon pay attention to mane.
<RAWRity> otakon: no
<Ryunosuke> what is wmc?

<Reikim> otakon has a massive white knighting issue. Meanwhile's a prick. We've known this for a while. Now we're going to shut up about it, because talking about things that everyone already knows about is a known form of Lacking Intelligence. Talk about the weather or something if you want to be like that, at least we've got geographical differences in that area.

<fluttercry> 05,15My friend has a bunny. It bit me the first time I saw it
<otakon> I think we were up to ....
<PrincessCadance> better a late start in Season 3 than a huge drought for Season 4
<otakon> 5?
<VenHur> It's official folks, Season 3's in november, you can stop spoiling now.
<Lunar_Brony> ohai Shizuka
<sonicdude558> Hey guys remember this? http://derpy.me/mINw5

<taoumi> Shizuka: ..... sure but what about the fur geting in the way
<pony_9000> bro hoof to every pony nite
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Shizuka
<Reikim> And one awful pony t-shirt.
<fluttercry> 05,15I wouldn't have minded rabbit stu.
<otakon> how so might I ask?
<Lunar_Brony> g'night pony_9000
<otakon> i've had rabbit stew
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5Ja23HfhY&feature=related
<otakon> it was pretty good actually
<lowfn> My friend is becoming a Legend of Zelda fan/ fapper... November better get its butt over here now.....
<Rex_Mundi> http://d.hatena.ne.jp/video/niconico/sm17317029
<Reikim> Stew is evidence of God.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night, pony_9000. :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also Deer i like deer
<Shizuka> 13hm
<otakon> a little too much pepper in that batch though
<fluttercry> 05,15why did I spell it stu
<Shizuka> 13washing maybe
<Meanwhile> Deer is better than rabbit.
<otakon> I LOVE Deer Chops
<fluttercry> 05,15I'm tired ;__;
<otakon> fat and all
<Reikim> Take any meat and stew it long enough, and it will become impossible to identify the source of the meat.
<otakon> Good stuff
<Meanwhile> fluttercry: If you hadn't mentioned that we'd have assumed it was intentional.
<CrimsonPhoenix> lowfn, Zelda is a good choice
<CrimsonPhoenix> better than Peach at least
<Reikim> Any meat becomes beef/chicken/pork with stewing.
<otakon> lol
<taoumi> Shizuka: i tryed bleach for a good bit. didn't do anything :(
<otakon> I love stew too
<Shizuka> 13:<
<Shizuka> 13dunno then :/
<Buytoast> bleaching an animal?
<fluttercry> 05,15It's a joke I've had with my mom that we'd get a rabbit and name him Stu. Guess I just slipped up
<taoumi> http://imgur.com/ZPBzx
<Kimori> back
<otakon> XD
<Cades> wb
<Buytoast> what's with the styrofoam horse
<lowfn> Fun Fact: The show Doctor Who is considered and by technical definition, a religion
<taoumi> it's not it's a blank
<Kimori> ty
<Shizuka> 13ohhhhh
<Shizuka> 13fabric
<otakon> Buytoast: looks like a plushie form
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> lowfn: I heard about that.
<otakon> Shizuka: it's a form isn't it?
<Shizuka> 13thought you meant a little plastic one
<Yahooz> But that rabbit will lose control of his life...
<Cades> np
<fluttercry> 05,15What kind of stain are we trying to get out of what item?
<Shizuka> 13or foam
<sonicdude558> BANG BANG http://derpy.me/mINw5
<Yahooz> at 4 in the morning
<Rex_Mundi> it would be awesome, that the sceane in RE0 where Wesker and birkin are watching a TV moniter, it was edited so they were watching ponies. Just a weird thought.
<Ninjazz> At 4am in the mornin-damnit.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LbqYndiB7bk/UG9c2vJQAHI/AAAAAAAARSw/8MfANf-DZMY/s1600/0927121234b.jpg don't look bad would not go looking for work with them but they don't look bad
<Shizuka> 13well, white foam, could try whiteout

<Lunar_Brony> sonicdude558 LoLz
<Ninjazz> fluttercry is Angelica.
<Squallken> Im confused
<taoumi> never ran into this problem because i've never done a white one before
<VenHur> I'll be right back you guys, switching from my new laptop to my computer.
<Buytoast> Resident Evil Zero was terrible though
<Shizuka> 13contrary to popular belief i'm not much of an arts and crafts mare... never had the money or the space for it
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: are those catgirl controllers on the right?
<fluttercry> 05,15Is Stu making pudding still a meme or did that die out?
<fluttercry> 05,15I liked the Gurren Lagann one
<Meanwhile> Also, lag happens.
<otakon> Buytoast: the REmake was awesome however
<fluttercry> 05,15REmake was great
<Ninjazz> I think it's something that's referenced every now and then.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon the right one it a xbox one the other is not a controller as far as i can tell
<Ninjazz> Not really meme-worthy anymore.
<Meanwhile> Once in a blue moon.
<Rex_Mundi> Im sure the old school fans at the MLP arena have tons of tips for pony ars and crafts and customizing toys, they have been at it since the 80s after all.
<otakon> ah
<ASoftFluffyThing> Remake of what?
<otakon> fluttercry: dead
<fluttercry> 05,15RE6 is....wat. The reviews, from players and critics alike are all over the place

<NocturnalBlade> ASoftFluffyThing: a think they are talkin about Resident Evil Zero and its remake
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ohhh
<NocturnalBlade> *i
<Tovler> back from watching Animal Crossing videos
<fluttercry> 05,15It's always sad to see a meme die.
<Meanwhile> Touché. And props for rolling with that one, I was expecting caps.
<fluttercry> 05,15Guile's Theme was my introduction to ponies
<Rex_Mundi> I love the old school RE games, new school games starting with RE4 should have went stelth survival rather than action schooters, if you ask me.
<taoumi> ok looks like my best bet it to soak it in rubing achoholl.
<NocturnalBlade> wb Tovler
<Reikim> Memes dying? Sad?
<Meanwhile> I was sadder when Hitler died.
<Reikim> The universe cheers every time a meme dies.
<sonicdude558> In the meantime, caption this http://i45.tinypic.com/281zk7c.png
<Buytoast> Resident Evil 6? Oh, you mean Rooty tooty Call of Duty Zombies map Special Bonus Unlock?
<Ninjazz> Arrow To The Knee wasn't sad.
<otakon> Meanwhile: I can come back every once in a great while. It's like a falling star blink and you'll miss it.
<fluttercry> 05,15Let me rephrase that. Good ones that were actually fun
<Buytoast> because that's what resident evil is now you know
<otakon> Ninjazz: Damn knee, war wound's acting up. From Borderlands 2.
<fluttercry> 05,15Arrow to the Knee was forced and only got popular because of the idiots that played Skyrim.
<Meanwhile> But they all stagnate before they die.
<Meanwhile> They're like flowers.
<otakon> Buytoast: lol yes
<Ninjazz> otakon, OOOOOHHHHH NOOOOOO.
<Meanwhile> Pretty for a while then they end up in compost.
<otakon> Buytoast: I honestly want to try it out though
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i used to be a meme like you but then i i took and arrow to the knee
<fluttercry> 05,15The number of people I know that think memes come from memebase is sadly too high
<otakon> Ninjazz: oh yes
<Ninjazz> God....damnit.
<fluttercry> 05,15Also, waaaaaaaaay too many people like Tosh.O
<Buytoast> Just get resident Evil 5 and imagine you get to play as six people now instead of just two
<otakon> Ninjazz: Borderlands 2 is a fun damn game filled to the BRIM with nods, references and easter eggs.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Still no stream? Or should I refresh?
<Tovler> almost got past the first few minutes of the Animal Crossing movie without crying nostalgia tears.
<fluttercry> 05,15COOL STORY BRO
<otakon> Buytoast: you can't move and shoot at the same time for one.
<Ninjazz> otakon, I've been playing it a bit, but haven't seen much, or any at all. But THAT is kinda disappointing.
<Dark_Horst> stream over? was away
<fluttercry> 05,15I hate how one of the characters yells that every 40th kill
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Tosh.O ?
<otakon> Buytoast: two you can't take control of a monster and shomp someone online either
<Meanwhile> Borderlands 2. Aka Borderlands 1.
<Rex_Mundi> So guys, I want to go to Bronycon this year, if I can graduate out of my training program or get a few days off I can make it. How does one get a ticket to this thing?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/3tH60cNil1g
<Tovler> Feels weird not hearing Moves Like Jagger
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dark_Horst, it's over for now.
<NocturnalBlade> ASoftFluffyThing: no, no stream...but Scoots said SB was doing the aftershow lol
<Ninjazz> A terrible comedy show on Comedy Central.
<fluttercry> 05,15Zer0 says "Hillarious, you've activiated my trap card"
<ASoftFluffyThing> NocturnalBlade, okay
<Kurra> Rex_Mundi, stay tuned....
<Meanwhile> Do any of them dance Gangnam Style?
<fluttercry> 05,15TheGreatAndPowerfulT imagine if that guy who reposts 5 year old videos and memes had a TV show
<fluttercry> 05,15that's him
<otakon> Ninjazz: it gets better when you get further on, once you hit Sanctuary it starts to hit it's stride
<The_Scientist> As Celestia's Sun rises on Ponyville 2 figures stand on the edge of a forest, one a small dragon shaped one with spikes runnning up its back the other a taller 4 legged pony shaped figure with a horn coming from its head. One of the fgiures speaks “Twilight why are we up so early? I wanna go back to bed.” The shorter figure Moans. The taller figure, Twilight answers “I know its early Spike but we cant let anypony kno
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Rex_Mundi: You can usually purchase them online or at the door, I think.
<Kurra> Bronycon is starting its own reg system, and the details of it are yet to be... revealed I think
<otakon> It's best playing with friends however
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> meh
<fluttercry> 05,15Meanwhile not yet, but I expect DLC with that
<Kinixys> http://youtu.be/i7v5wDVDpnc
<otakon> I don't think I've seen a OG ref in it
<otakon> yet
<Ninjazz> Got it cracked and most people I know sleep when I'm on, otakon. :/
<Spectrum_Rush> tl;dr
<Buytoast> what's with the fanfics
<Meanwhile> Twisted Fate from League of Legends is getting an updated model, and a new dance with it. Guess what dance it is.
<otakon> Ninjazz: you're fault, play when they are online
<otakon> OH
<otakon> I heard TOR is F2P now
<DocSane> God, please. No badly-written fanfics.
<Ninjazz> otakon, can't. >_<
<fluttercry> 05,15Dammit, society is trying to make me hate Gangnam Style
*Sketch_Toku_Brony plays Rayman Origins :)
<Meanwhile> Well that didn't take long.
<Wrek> 05i think i managed to config my joystick not to be so glitchy
<Kurra> you see all that Rex Mundi? But it's proably going to be some 'pay $40 or something and pre-reg your con badge' on the con website.
<otakon> fluttercry: I saw it on Kelly in the Morning the other day
<Buytoast> actually, i think i've read this, and i think i get's erotic
<Meanwhile> Though frankly I'm surprised ToR didn't trip out of the gate and break it's teeth.
<fluttercry> 05,15It was on the Ellen show the other day too
<fluttercry> 05,15ToR it pretty much did
<The_Scientist> it cant be erotic or read before i just wrote it
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Nice. How do you like it? :)
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UvEgxpDcvM
<Meanwhile> Heard Gangnam Style in a workplace radio yesterday.
<Dark_Horst> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ebha1NW5t0
<Dark_Horst> dont mind me
<Lunar_Brony> ever had a Bston Cream Pie that warm and fresh from the oven, with the chocolate oozing off and thee custard is warm? I'm having one now and it is delicious.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> btw dis is the song that rolls out in my head when playing medic http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH4D7Uod4Cg
<Meanwhile> Frankly, it's making me feel like a hipster.
<Buytoast> ah, no wonder. it looks like pretty much every other story written by every other person
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Lunar_Brony: Sounds really good.
<Lunar_Brony> just thouGHT i'd let you know
<Ninjazz> Even Korea thinks it's overrated as hell.
<otakon> Meanwhile: well apparently it's now the best single player MMO on the market according to a guy called the Rageaholic from Youtube, you'd like him man he's nearly as cynical as you are in his reviews
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Cypresswolf: :D
<Kurra> Lunar_Brony... o-oh.. my. ~///~
<Lunar_Brony> dam n keyboard
<Lunar_Brony> can't type with one hand
<Cypresswolf> I got another October surprise for Everypony :)
<Meanwhile> otakon: The best single player MMO. If you want to play by yourself, why're you playing MMO's.
<Lunar_Brony> ?
<otakon> lol
<fluttercry> 05,15Someone at my school tried to post Dwight photos on a YOLO sign on one of the bulletin boards, fucked it up so bad that now I have to put up a "That post gave me cancer" and "You're meme is bad" photot
<Zuxxez123> OH yeah?
<Kurra> o.o?
<otakon> that's the joke
<fluttercry> 05,15Idiots
<DocSane> If I ever wrote a pony fic, it would be about one of them coming to THIS world for a damn change.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Lunar_Brony: 0_O LOL
<otakon> anyway gonna go check if it IS F2P
<otakon> brb
<Meanwhile> Your.
<Wirisme> Is it a nice surprise?
<Zuxxez123> DocSane: What a tweest!
<Phase4> 00,02NullRadix, Ping
<fluttercry> 05,15fuck
<otakon> lol
<fluttercry> 05,15Now my meme is bad
<Lunar_Brony> hi Phase4
<NullRadix> Phase4: pong
<Kurra> Cypresswolf, say it cx
<fluttercry> 05,15it's a never ending cycle
<NocturnalBlade> dat Phase4
<NullRadix> WHAT?
<Meanwhile> Forever bad.
<NullRadix> busy being an idiot of sorts
<DocSane> And it would end with the pony telling the human to stop assuming Equestria is some sort of utopian paradise and remind them that monsters wander out of the woods every other week.
<fluttercry> 05,15But yeah, if you're going to post a meme to mock yolo, don't screw it up.
<Yahooz> There is a boat in the harbor i sail out of named YOLO
<Cypresswolf> Bobby Bare "Marie Laveau" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpZzehuWdM4
<fluttercry> 05,15SINK IT
<Yahooz> written in COMIC FUCKING SANS :/
<Ninjazz> ...
<Lunar_Brony> DocSane I'm writing a (hopefully) non-cliche HiE.
<fluttercry> 05,15LOL all aboard the S.S. Troll
<Lunar_Brony> DocSane just to prove such fics exist
<DocSane> See, I don't like HiE stories because they all end up feeling the same.
<VenHur> And i'm back, just switched to my computer.
<Rex_Mundi> DocSane: That sounds more like G1 ponyverse than G4, I hope G4 starts to get a little more dangerous like G1 was. Just a little less slice of life and a little more adventures.
<Meanwhile> U jelly of his boat.
<Cypresswolf> If I knew anything about video mixing, I'd make a Zecora pmv out of that
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lunar_Brony, if it's about a hater visiting equestria then let me tell you it's already been done
<Kurra> slice of life, topped with whipped danger.
<Lunar_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix far from it
<otakon> dammit
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so emma watson doing 50 shades of grey movie, what about that ?
<otakon> it's still not F2P
<fluttercry> 05,15wat
<Spectrum_Rush> rule of fanfiction: everythings been done, everything is cliche, mary sue, OOC
<Spectrum_Rush> :P
<Kurra> not everything has been done.
<fluttercry> 05,15Emma Watson in a movie about kinky bondage.......
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i knew i would get at least a wat
<DocSane> Sex with the CMC. It's ALL been done.
<otakon> fluttercry: and she'll be NAKED
<Kurra> not by any stretch of any imagination! :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DocSane: :S
<DocSane> The sex stories usually done first, sadly.
<fluttercry> 05,15NOOOOOOOOOO
<otakon> lol
<Kurra> DocSane, that's eww x.x
<otakon> where is that button?
<Yahooz> im sold
<Meanwhile> Didn't they also get Justin Bieber for that movie adaptation?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon she does not even have the role, she want to
<fluttercry> 05,15OH GOD
<richfiles> Stream still ded... :( We didn't even have any move like Jagger :'(
<DocSane> Kurra: Yeah, that was my reaction when I realized what I was reading, too.
<fluttercry> 05,15Justin Bieber X Emma Watson
<otakon> http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
<Rex_Mundi> Spectrum_Rush: What about a fanfic, where when Luna was sent to the moon, she wasnt on the surface, but was really trapped in the darkness in her head with only her thoughts. The fanfic follows her thoughts.
<CrimsonPhoenix> richfiles, yeah you're right
<CrimsonPhoenix> what gives
<Kurra> Xp
<otakon> use as needed
<fluttercry> 05,15so many conflicted people
<DashWithRainbows> fluttercry the sound of weeping men across the globe will be heard.
<Wrek> 05yeah this is much better
<Spectrum_Rush> Rex_Mundi: been done
<Wrek> 05now i can actualyl steer
<The_Scientist> everyone you should all aknlowegde that i started this conversation
<DashWithRainbows> and some women.
<Meanwhile> Well do you really want to see Bieber spanking Watson with a riding crop?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Steer?
<Kurra> o/~ Another man done gone.... o/~
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wait is fifty shades of gray about lesbians ?
<fluttercry> 05,15Sounds like a bad fanfic
<Meanwhile> T: Lol'd.
<DocSane> Rex_Mundi: Problem is that she was trapped as Nightmare Moon, not Luna, so it'd mainly be a lot of "I can't wait to get back and make them all pay!"
<fluttercry> 05,15so...like a regular fanfic
<Wrek> 05configurign my joystick so i can pilot better in planetside
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Oh.
<fluttercry> 05,15There is one that is about, I shit you not, Goku and FUCKING ANNE FRANK
<Ninjazz> You mean you don't know it was a Twilight (YES THAT ABOMINATION) fanfic?
<Meanwhile> "Configuring my joystick"
<Rex_Mundi> has Wrek drawn anything recently?
<Cranberry_Scotch> We don't actually know if eternal night was really what Nightmare wanted
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would like to see a fanfic that goes against most of the fanon facts
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/3Pqsi.png
<Meanwhile> Please, Goku x Anne Frank is OTP.
<Cranberry_Scotch> After all, history is written by the victors
<DocSane> I'm going to say yes, since that's what Tirak wanted in the original pilot, and Mare in the Moon is basically a remake of it.
<Spectrum_Rush> Cranberry_Scotch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3Rj2uLPgk
<Spectrum_Rush> yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaa
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/gkKjs.png
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> here have awesome metal head playing awesome weeaboo songs in metal http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88tNh76Iz-8
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, I really liek your mane in that pic :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://youtu.be/E2Rx1YHfibg
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Meanwhile: What crap again?
<Meanwhile> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Eh, use your imagination.
<fluttercry> 05,15oh it's that guy that does everything metal....I think
<Cranberry_Scotch> For all we know, she may have just wanted to extend the night for a few hours originally, Celestia over reacts and in the process of sealing her, gives her the idea of eternal night
<Rex_Mundi> All G4 fans should check out that First G1 MLP special, in my opinion.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep
<Ninjazz> E331Rock?
<Spectrum_Rush> Meanwhile: I like the fact that you added a moustache
<Wrek> 05hahaha
<Wrek> 05im not dying!
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah! I like him.
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: I actually didn't, that pic was sent to me by someone else.
<DocSane> For me, MLP fanfics break down into three general categories: those that try to be like normal episodes, those that drip with emotion, and those that try and shock the reader.
<fluttercry> 05,15Funny that, since I don't like metal.
<Ninjazz> Me too. He did Kingdom Hearts, Dr. Who, and some I've never thought could be heard in metal form.
<fluttercry> 05,15Except for 80s metal. That was the best stuff
<Spectrum_Rush> well props to that guy then Meanwhile
<DocSane> In a nutshell, Average Episode, My Little Dashie, and Cupcakes.
<Cranberry_Scotch> And each one can further be broken down
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Ikr.
<Ralin> Is anything going to be streaming later?
<fluttercry> 05,15DocSane and they all fall into the category of terrible
<richfiles> Agreed Rex... Excape from Midnight Castle is a MUST SEE for all MLP fans. It really lays some foundations for what eventually develops into G4! :)
<Cranberry_Scotch> Fror instance, the shockers can be gore, porn or simply more rife with emotion than category two
<NocturnalBlade> Ralin: yea, i think SB is gonna do something
<CrimsonPhoenix> DocSane, can you please rename your emotional category?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0deA1JUUZFQ and then mordekaiser
<DocSane> CrimsonPhoenix: Why?
<Ralin> Thanks NocturnalBlade.
<fluttercry> 05,15I see he did Tunak Tunak Tun. I know what I'm watching next
<NocturnalBlade> no prob Ralin
<richfiles> It's too emotional for Crimson! :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hue Hue Hue.
<Dovah> there a stream?
<CrimsonPhoenix> no
<DocSane> CrimsonPhoenix: It's the quintessential heavy emotion MLP fanfic.
<CrimsonPhoenix> MLD doesn't deserve to be a title of a category
<richfiles> BWAHAHAHAHA!!! :D
<Meanwhile> Huehuehue indeed. You'll never escape Nidalee. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9O0WIoSmFI
<Buytoast> so guise in my story twiligt sporkle mets spoke out front of castle canterolot and themns a tree kidnapps fluttershy so ahow many chapets shoul i make it 7 oor 15?
<fluttercry> 05,15Didn't he do ponies too?
<Ninjazz> The Tunak Tunak one was actually kinda diappointing.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> he did
<Cranberry_Scotch> gut really, most fanfics are a combination of two or more categories
<Ninjazz> fluttercry, eyup.
<Rex_Mundi> Check out this fangame, its not in english but just listen to ponyville music. http://d.hatena.ne.jp/video/niconico/sm17317029
<DocSane> CrimsonPhoenix: I refuse to read it. Like Cupcakes, I only know of it via osmosis.
<ASoftFluffyThing> OH THAT REMINDS ME.
<Ninjazz> I think... I think that was the first MLP thing I watched on YouTube.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> still nothing more awesome than jarvan Meanwhile
<NocturnalBlade> what ASoftFluffyThing ?
<fluttercry> 05,15I feel alone in my hate for fanfics :(
<Meanwhile> Pfft, l2Flash.
<DocSane> fluttercry: You're not. I kind of despise them, too.
<CrimsonPhoenix> there are some that are interesting
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'm 'sposed to be drawing.
<Rex_Mundi> dont cry, fluttercry!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph5ZfxQQ0As
<CrimsonPhoenix> like I enjoy Background Pony
<Dark_Horst> probably because you havent read the right ones yet
<richfiles> I own TWO copies of Fallout Equestra In hardcover print! Twily would be proud of my epic pony war books! :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you can't beat that
<Cranberry_Scotch> I reAD cupcakes, it wasn't that shocking
<NocturnalBlade> ASoftFluffyThing: oooo, what ya drawin?
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko-qsjfEcRM&list=UUg3WNGww9ZJC-V8KE9wvM3A&index=3&feature=plcp
<Buytoast> i regret writing mine
<Kencolt> DocSane: So... where does a story like Arrow 18 fit in there? Because it really doesn't.
<Cranberry_Scotch> I actually felt it was someTHIng pinkie might do
<Rosfox> I don't really read fanfics because it takes away my view of the canon show
<Dark_Horst> i found cupcakes mildly amusing
<ASoftFluffyThing> NocturnalBlade, a picture
<DocSane> fluttercry: Fanfic can be the worst sort of masturbation, and anything you like can be undone by the actual show making a new episode.
<Buytoast> i should've done something better with my time
<twilight_sprinkle> welp, fucking internet made me miss everything
<DocSane> Kencolt: Not familiar with it.
<NocturnalBlade> ASoftFluffyThing: -_- why am i not surprised by that answer from you
<fluttercry> 05,15That why I LOVE when the show destroys fanon
<twilight_sprinkle> well, at least the second half of yugioh and the ep
<CrimsonPhoenix> fluttercry, me too
<Meanwhile> Really, none of them flashed at all.
<twilight_sprinkle> so did yugioh get WMCd?
<fluttercry> 05,15hell no
<Buytoast> it's always funny to see people get so butthurt when their precious fanon is oblitereated
<twilight_sprinkle> good
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh those delicious reaction when Vinyl showed her iris
<Meanwhile> Besides, I main Fate, I can teleport long distance.
<ASoftFluffyThing> The only fanfic I'm looking forward to re-reading is Progress. I hate to think that it's unfinished :(
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> seeing fanon destroyed by canon makes me laugh
<flutterchu> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdgbwC6bGTI
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you probably get bursted before that
<Kencolt> Arrow 18 Mission Logs: Lone Ranger. Probably the only realistic "Human in Equestria" fic ever written-- and sheer brilliance.
<fluttercry> 05,15Like when Luna wasn't a sheltered invalid
<Cranberry_Scotch> The show can either destroy fanon, like with Cupcakes, or embrace fanon, like with Derpy
<twilight_sprinkle> compared to dbz movies yugioh was a piece of art anyway
<DocSane> Best destruction of fanon was Luna's protrayal in LE.
<Buytoast> B-B-BUT HER EYES ARE RED. FUCKING HASBRO
<twilight_sprinkle> plus it was pretty fn
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DocSane: I agree
<CrimsonPhoenix> DocSane, really?
<Cranberry_Scotch> There's a very good reason for that
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well I wasn't there for that
<Rex_Mundi> Buytoast: It was just the shadow, her eyes are really bright red
<CrimsonPhoenix> care to explain?
<Buytoast> AHAHAAH
<Spectrum_Rush> fluttercry: I thank god that was not true
<richfiles> I disagree. Canon Luna was a very subtle mixing of many interperetations of Luna.
<DocSane> Suddenly, all those sad widdle woona drawings of her in a cardboard box magically vanished.
<Meanwhile> True tbh, but maybe they'll be too busy beating on Amumu.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, HA
<Buytoast> keep yourself in denial there sonny
<CrimsonPhoenix> HAHAHAHAhAH
<CrimsonPhoenix> ADfldqsanjfkiwsNJGFV
<CrimsonPhoenix> HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<fluttercry> 05,15DocSane wasn't it glorious?
