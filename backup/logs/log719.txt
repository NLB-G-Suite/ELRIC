<AttackWithHugs> Let your hate flow through you.
<Cypresswolf> Joy Joy
<CrimsonPhoenix> This goddamn rage containment
<DocSane> Rarity would be a terrible, terrible mother.
<CrimsonPhoenix> best part
<EspyLacopa|2> XylemTube: ...No, it's an older sister being annoyed by her younger sister. IE, normal sibling thing.
<OohShiny> don't cry SB
<CrimsonPhoenix> seriously
<Floris> Suddenly: APPLEBLOOM!
<RaveBrony> Well come one!! Rarity has Work to do! :9

<slendy> ...
<Conyst> Also evening Bronystate.
<Kandarihu|Zoro> We need to be able to trust the outcome of this election, for one thing. Regardless of who wins, there are going to be charges of the election being rigged or stolen by whoever wins. And if that takes hold, NEITHER of them are going to win, and our Republic is toast.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Conyst. :)
<Kurra> SpeedyBolt: What stars impaled in whose heads? D:
<AttackWithHugs> Hi Conyst
<slendy> well thats not nice
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: votes dont matter
<slendy> HATE
<Everlasting_Joy> "Rarity will think it's a great idea!" "What a rediculous idea!" :D
<fluttercry> 05,15Also, I know how Rarity feels. I hate it when people try to clean my work space. I know where everything is. Just because it looks messy doesn't mean it is.
<DocSane> Rarity's idea of child care is to stick her little sister in a room and ignore her.
<AJIsAwesome> Midnight_Fyre: :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: but there hasnt been any real proof against them, just people complaining, but it seems legit enough
<Wubstep> Aj : What DiddyaSay 'Bout mah Home?

<AttackWithHugs> Every time Sweetie Belle has a voice crack, drink!
<OohShiny> VOICE CRACK!
<Crippler> she goes through ten different facial expressions in two seconds
<Punkie_Pue> That must be so difficult to do as a voice actress.
<slendy> D':
<cowvarkian> fluttercry: even though it doesnt matter who anyone votes for?
<DocSane> I like the Rari-pout
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love you rarity <3
<Kurra> Honestly, if anyone complains about American voting, they are welcome to come over and singlehandedly clean install a new voting system.
<SpeedyBolt> >Difficult
<SpeedyBolt> >Tabitha
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rari-pout is best pout
<SpeedyBolt> ...How dare you, she's a god :U

<Cypresswolf> RAWR! Did I scare ya? Wait - what war crime
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: whatever you say, george
<Miksu4> HUNEY
<Saturn> 08,01i love the tension between Rarity and Applejack
<DocSane> Kurra: The problem is that there's no standard for voting. 50 states = 50 different systems.
<slendy> no she wont
<cowvarkian> fluttercry: Im sure it does
<Punkie_Pue> Just wait for her to die sisters always do
<Kurra> Indeed DocSane.
<fluttercry> 05,15Now, if you voted for the loser, then yeah, your vote pretty much meant nothing.
<OJ> Y'know, this may be one of the most flawless episodes.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not sure what shipping is cuter: AJxRarity or AJxRD
*Kurra annoyed, when every country has its corruptions and limitations, but only people from other countries seem to all agree it's okay to point out American stuff that goes wrong.
<cowvarkian> fluttercry: which is why ohio is the only state that matter
<OohShiny> OJ: heart warming
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttercry: but isnt it always like that?
<Kandarihu|Zoro> In Tennessee, the votes are done by paper ballot which is fed into a vote counting machine.
<RaveBrony> I love this scene
<cowvarkian> *matters
<Sumica> 00,10damn AJ is strong
<CrimsonPhoenix> Saturn, Rarijack clearly
<OJ> OohShiny: That too
<Saturn> 08,01wait
<OohShiny> and another voice crack
<Sparkarez> These ads had BETTER not be popping up when I'm watching S3 on here...
<J_E_Smith71> fluttercry: And if you voted for the third party canidate. "Go ahead, throw your vote away!"
<slendy> then apple jack beats apple bloom
<Saturn> 08,01why do they keep pigs?
<Conyst> is it absolutely flawless
<JeisuTheUma> lol
<slendy> HEAD SHOT

<slendy> 3gethe
<Miksu4> Buffering
<Saturn> 08,01and ponies are vegetarain
<DocSane> The difference between AJ and Rarity is, of course, that AJ isn't completely self-centered.
<fluttercry> 05,15Yeah, third party votes are meaningless
<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn: You can make soap from their fat.
<Sumica> 00,10waste disposal
<cachi01|scaryshit> anyway obama is going to win
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Because pigs haven't been shown on the show as sentient enough beings?
<SpeedyBolt> Opal doesnt give a
<StupidSexyIsh> chat ded :(
<Spazturtle> Sparkarez: Get addbloker
<cowvarkian> Saturn: thats what you think
<OohShiny> dat Opal
<AttackWithHugs> Saturn, as pets maybe?
<CrimsonPhoenix> IDEA
<Madfish> And truffles
<SaxyPretender|Dinner> 0,14they probably use them for truffles?
<Kandarihu|Zoro> Kurra, indeed. And there are going to be U.N. observers from these dictatorships to "monitor" the election, but only in the red states.
<AlienWarhead> Sparkarez: It shouldn't, but maybe you shold get adblocker
<DocSane> Saturn: They use the pigs to find truffles.
<Pale_Horse> we don't have hard proof that ponies are stricty vegetarian.
<OohShiny> Opalescence is best cat
<Midnight_Fyre> I really wanted to write in Derpy Hooves on my ballotl, but I ended up voting for one of the major candidates who I don't like just to keep peace in my household
<cowvarkian> cachi01|scaryshit: indeed
<Conyst> I say we all vote Chewbacca
<CrimsonPhoenix> and there is that photo I made you guys guess
<SpeedyBolt> Bet you feel bad now, dont you?
*Kurra knows like 200 stereotypes, half-truths,and FULL truths and horrible legacies about many groups, countries, and races, but he isn't about to go talk 'em all.... well except about furs, because we some freaky freaks yo.
<DocSane> Saturn: Word of Faust on that one.

<Ryunosuke> so naive, so cute :)
<Sumica> 00,10could also use to seek out mushrooms

<SpeedyBolt> Not really, though.
<Midnight_Fyre> OJ: In the secret room in the back of the barn

<AJIsAwesome> Technially, sheep cannot survive by themselves. They need a leader, otherwise they'll most likely end up dead and scattered frin their group.
<Midnight_Fyre> Has anyone ever written a story about the Apple family still? There is some potential for a great comedy fic there
<Kurra> When I saw Rarity cry, I wanted to cry, the first time I ever saw this.
<AttackWithHugs> Rarity would be perfect for a soap opera.
<slendy> ....

<slendy> ....
<cowvarkian> OJ: sure
<J_E_Smith71> Don't you need legally disown her first, Applebloom?
<Sumica> 00,10applebell?

<Sumica> 00,10sounds like fastfood
<slendy> :'(
<Kandarihu|Zoro> CrimsonPhoenix, I heard that as "Heart Drive"
<SpeedyBolt> Fun level: 0%
<OohShiny> Applejack, why are you so good and make me look so bad

<SaxyPretender|Dinner> 0,14I really liked Secret of My Excess
<Sparkarez> I can't believe people actually ship Rarity and Sweetie Belle...
<Kandarihu|Zoro> OJ, not sure. Battle of the sexes becomes a factor, there. Perhaps.
<Apokalipse> skype sometimes does that to me. It thinks that everyone of my contacts decided to call me
<fluttercry> 05,15Tabitha has such an awesome voice
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, tractor huh
<Sumica> 00,10what, ewwww
<Randomiser> Tabitha is the best VA

<Ghosties> 04Admitting that showing that particlar episode conflicted with the current code of conduct of http://www.bronystate.net/, and that I personally do not condone overly explicit material neither streamed nor discussed in the sites chatrooms, and that I apologize for any inconvenience it might have caused.
<Ghosties> 04As such I am relieved of the privilege to stream for the site starting as of the incident day for a month forward, leaving this suspention to end the 18th of November 2012.

<AJIsAwesome> Don't WMC this movie, please. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> *least
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This movie is too much fun.
<Ghosties> 04"Like, five minutes?"
<Crippler> oh god
*AttackWithHugs doesn't know how to feel about this movie now
<Meanwhile> Drunken arse.
<Crippler> too many accents
<Kurra> this movie won't be WMC'd
<Kothen> Dat Irish....
<Yahooz> Mica
<Ghosties> 04Lady, you do realize you're talking to a drunken Irish hobo?
<Svettponny> pony_5324: I agree wholeheartedly.
<pony_300> honestly I'm wonrdering how they will possibly top a shark jumping into the clouds to chomp on a plane.
<Meanwhile> The luck o' the oirish.
<Wubstep> IM IRISH :D
<Spazturtle> Ghosties: Can we have a Worst Movie Clause night one time?
<Tovler> If you keep saying WMC, I'll pick Southland Tales for B.
<OJ> he's Irish-ish...
<Kandarihu|Zoro> The WMC potential for this movie died the moment the Mega Shark ate the jetliner
<Mozdoc> I doubt this guy is authenticly Irish.
<pony_4135> tell me about it dick
<SafariMonkey> I bet this had a bigger budget than Twelve Angry Men
<OohShiny> I don't give a fuck for the buffers
<twilight_sprinkle> lul
<Meanwhile> I don't get the saying "Luck of the Irish"
<Ghosties> 04I've been pushing for one Spazturtle
<Crippler> THE INSTITUTE
<Kurra> WHAT
<Kurra> THEY WHAT
<Bipolarized> Favorite student...It's Princess Celestia!
<Meanwhile> They were nearly wiped out because they ran out of potatoes.
<Ghosties> 04But we just haven't found the right time
<Punkie_Pue> wtf does that mean?
<Wubstep> Im Irish <3 :3
<Fenr> MEGASEAGULL
<Meanwhile> If there's anything less lucky for a people, I'd love to hear it.
<Kurra> Ireland= beauty
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm against a WMC night. It'll bore you to tears.
<Fenr> no,wait...
<Svettponny> "H a h a. Funny you should ask".
<OohShiny> I am not paying attention to the story, cuz it has nothing
<pony_4135> its kindof quiet
<Spazturtle> Ghosties: April 1st?
<Reikim> It's ironic
<StupidSexyIsh> shark based horror films are stupid if the option of staying out of the fucking water is an option
<Ghosties> 04Wubstep: Like fully Irish? From Ireland?
<Svettponny> The laugh was so authentic.
<Mozdoc> The birds...and flashes.
<Kandarihu|Zoro> Okay. My mother is watching the movie and she is VERY irritated by the pings.
<Punkie_Pue> dat monitor
<OJ> Seagulls are the transitory device I see
<CrimsonPhoenix> This movie is offically Black and white flashes/10 for me
<pony_7255> stop showing that!
<CrimsonPhoenix> SO MANY BLACK WHITE FLASHES
<twilight_sprinkle> fwoosh
<Wubstep> Yes Ghosties
<Reactor> SCIENCE!
<Meanwhile> Time for science.
<Svettponny> I still say it was batman, that's totally a giant batarang.
<Ghosties> 04Very nice, sir
<pony_5324> lol
<fluttercry> 05,15But that's why Jaws worked, because it was a resort town and the mayor was an idiot
<Yahooz> This is like watching Bones
<The_medic> lets exam this hi c drink
<Zompony> who wants to watch Snakes on a Plane next loll
<Conyst> Then it turned into a huanted house movie.
<Obsidian> Time for bad CSI ripoffs
<Tovler> Seagulls eat puffin eggs. I don't like them
<OJ> COMPUTERS DON'T MAKE THAT SOUND
<Punkie_Pue> this movie is more black and white than 12 angry men
<The_medic> and this cool aid
<Kurra> Kandarihu|Zoro: you have an awesome mom if she comprehends the humor of BMN, I think :)
<Bloxx> oh man, they're sciencing super hard right now
<Wubstep> Im a Girl xP
<Ghosties> 04I'd like to visit your country sometime, Wubstep
<BaconMane> 0,5I'm sorry I can't sit through the restof this
<AJIsAwesome> Do you mind muting the pings, Sumica? :)
<pony_7255> SOAP was epic

<OohShiny> Yahooz: bones is way better man
<Crippler> you've got mail
<Ghosties> 04And noted~
<Mozdoc> Red liquid = science.
<Reikim> Oh look, the other mod I wanted to bug.
<Nyst> This isn't science, this is what lazy lab assitants do when pretending to work.
<SafariMonkey> bye BaconMane
<Reikim> FC
<DocSane> You know, the black and white flashes should have some sort of meaning beyond "I think it looks kinda cool."
<Obsidian> See ya BaconMane
<AlienWarhead> We understand BaconMane
<Randomiser> BaconMane is cared of this movie
<Conyst> So bad ripoffs of bad ripoffs?
<pony_7255> and has an awesome acronym
<pony_300> The Wii-level CGI and the occasional greying back and forth makes me feel like we're watching a video game more than anything.
<fluttercry> 05,15And this shark jumped 30 thousand feet. He's dangerous!
<Reikim> When are you running another contest?
<String_Shredder> Science MONTAGE!
<OohShiny> Grey anatomy

<AJIsAwesome> Bye, BaconMane. :)
<Svettponny> So much science.
<pony_4135> so if its gray it is past?
<Kandarihu|Zoro> Kurra, I read some of the good jokes, and she likes it. But she's just watching the stream.
<The_medic> DURRRRR
<Reactor> WOW
<AttackWithHugs> Camera zoom
<weeping_pegasi82> this for some reason reminds me of the hulk movie the one where the hulk got bigger the angrier he got
<Bloxx> just look at that computer. so much science

<Punkie_Pue> feet? Miles.
<Meanwhile> Ten by Eleven feet.
<fluttercry> 05,15Reikim I'm not certain. There are no plans for one in the near future but that could change
<Reactor> They did that to figure out that it's a tooth
<Nyst> Well, she's stupid.
<meatloaf> Crystal Empire looks SOO awesome!
<Conyst> Miles
<Reikim> Fun, I look forward to it.
<pony_7255> you're the scientist-guy

<Sumica> 00,10ex navy prehistoric guru
<OohShiny> Yahooz: bones looks realistic enough

<Fenr> off to a new location
<AttackWithHugs> SaxyPretender, too bad he's dead
<pony_4135> now a face to the voice
<Kandarihu|Zoro> This movie is made in 2009? Any disaster that's "unexplained" is "explained" by global warming.
<Svettponny> Stop. Cutting. To. 50. Different. LOCATIONS!
<String_Shredder> He's angry! He's angry!
<StupidSexyIsh> SaxyPretender Steve Irwin died

<AttackWithHugs> Which could create more danger?
<Zompony> yay for sex
<Deadlypon3> ...>What they don't KNOW
<Pale_Horse> Wait. That's not the shark pheremone. It's the formula from "Re-Animator"... :P

<AJIsAwesome> SO CHEESY.........

<K_A> LASSIE?!
<SafariMonkey> Sumica: They probably don't see many attractive women in their line of work
<J_E_Smith71> Headed towards Tokyo? Heh, movie's over. Godzilla and Gamera will take care of it
<Reikim> There's a giant shark.
<JRP2234> RAWR

<Reikim> There's a giant octopus.
<pony_7255> halfway? Oh my god

<AttackWithHugs> How is Titanic 2? I've never seen it.
<Reactor> flutterchu: In some universe, this actually HAPPENED
<Everlasting_Joy> flutterchu: Yes, but I don't want to live in that universe. It probably hates ponies.
<Sumica> 00,10was a slow movie decade eh fluttercry
<Dark92Enigma> ''Nice and slowly''
<Zompony> yay
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01fluttercry: This movie had a larger budget then.
<twilight_sprinkle> DWR_TF2: dayum, you scrolled back that far?
<SafariMonkey> Kurra: Everyone knows that everything in science involves fluorescence and coloured compounds
<Lunar_Brony> fluttercry *shudders* that's a horrific though
<AJIsAwesome> Reactor: Misping. :)
<Deadlypon3> I freakin love it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In universe wherever.
<superretroworld> AlienWarhead: Svettponny sorry but we have to suffer
<Reikim> Did Oppenheimer work on that?
<Deadlypon3> DOn't you tell by mah acting
<Pale_Horse> Actually, in an infinite series of parallel universes, there exists at least one reality where the plot of this movie isn't ridiculous. :P
<VenHur> fluttercry: In this possible reality, I would not of been the silly VenHur that I am...
<L_Y_R_A> "I FRIKKAN LUV IT"
<Spazturtle> fluttercry: In one univers you are telepprted to the FiM universe
<DashWithRainbows> twilight_sprinkle I saw that someone referred to my name
<Reactor> oops
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: Yeah, I know what you meant. That was a Plan 9 reference
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> AttackWithHugs still don't get it
<Conyst> AttackWithHugs: Horrible. Some people live in that film
<Crippler> eh, he's had a few.
<L_Y_R_A> ...
<DashWithRainbows> Not hard to find when the text is orange.
<fluttercry> 05,15I didn't watch Plan 9 :(
<Deadlypon3> What did you say?
<Obsidian> Nittany_Discord: and the shark was voiced by Sean Connery
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm just gonna say we should watch Troll 2 next
<AttackWithHugs> Conyst, oh lord.
<Dark92Enigma> THAT's THE LINE........I FRRIKIN LOVE IT
<Midnight_Fyre> Reikim: Yes
<Deadlypon3> What did he say?
<Meanwhile> Plan 9 was bad.
<Spazturtle> 1 question, WHO THE FUCK USES ACTIVE SONAR?
<Tovler> Scott Pilgrim vs Giant Octopus *I'm bored*
<Dark92Enigma> DE-MEANOR
<K_A> The CGI isn't Titanic II levels of what, but it's really trying it's hardest right now.
<Svettponny> How can a movie named "Megashark VS Giant Octopus" be so booooooring?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Obsidian: That would be so awesome.
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: ah k, guess youre not using site client
<fluttercry> 05,15Tovler I'd watch that
<Midnight_Fyre> fluttercry: You missed a classic
<Kandarihu|Zoro> fluttercry, and in far more universes, the Academy of Arts and Sciences has better taste in movies than even what it has in our universe.
<K_A> *its hardest
<Zompony> Distract 9 i bet a lower buget then this and the CGI was better
*superretroworld weeping_pegasi82 has been banned for mentioning the worst movie ever made
<The_medic> zzzzzzzzzz
<Sumica> 00,10people that want to brodcast where they are to every thing withen 50 miles
<Kurra> District 9 was good, right?
<J_E_Smith71> Svettponny: Because we need more fight scenes between said shark and octopus instead of just exposition from these guys
<AttackWithHugs> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: About 10 minutes into the start of the movie, this shark leaps thousands of feet into the air and takes out an entire passenger plane
<Svettponny> Indeed!
<weeping_pegasi82> superretroworld: but it's to laugh at!
<twilight_sprinkle> amazing graphics
<Sumica> 00,10so who is running the arm?
<Rookeealding> Do any of these people die?

<L_Y_R_A> LOOK IN THE BACKGROUND ON THE LITTLE SCREEN...ITS PSY
<Starchaser> I love how earlier in the film the shark is about as big as a commercial plane. Now it's big enough to take a bite﻿ out of the Golden Gate Bridge

<Mozdoc> The city is fine! All it did was chomp your bridge...
<Pale_Horse> Why exactly is she in a military uniform?

<DocSane> They're like, what? 20 feet apart?
<Reikim> Look, you've got a whole ocean in which to make them fight.
<Reikim> It's not hard to choose a location.
<Reactor> There's a lot of room in that sub
<Mozdoc> Every fifteen minutes? Not fourteen minutes and fifty-nine seconds?
<Lunar_Brony> DocSane actually, 21 and a quarter
<superretroworld> Biltzwing: because you loved it the first time you became one, now dont let this shitty movie ruin it and FIGHT THE POWER

<Rookeealding> This movie would be more intersting if the Vs. part were to actually happen any time soon
<Deadlypon3> "Go to sick bay...ON MY DICK!"

<AttackWithHugs> But who's gonna lure them to the location?
<AlienWarhead> the light is making me green
<pony_300> I like twlight sparkle's plan. Welcome new overlord!
<Pale_Horse> Strangely this movie isn't as ridiculous as "Chupacabra Terror" with John Rhys-Davies. There the monster was only the size of a man... Yet managed to devour an entire freaking cruise ship in about an hour... and yet it was somehow surviving on only the occasional small animal on the small island it was on beforehand... Yeahhhh.... :|

<Biltzwing> I don't want to live on this planet anymore

<Dark92Enigma> Deadlypon3: SKILL = FATNESS. so i agree :D
<L_Y_R_A> "look alittle green"...ARE YOU BLIND...LOOK AT THE LIGHTS...THEY ARE FUCKING GREEN AD AN EVERGREEN TREE!!!!111!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!ONE!
<Meanwhile> Great. You have a feeling.
<Mozdoc> Do not let that women pilot the submarine... so far her history of piloting anything has led to it being destroyed...
<Deadlypon3> Yay for fatness
<AlienWarhead> Pale_Horse: People always eat too much on cruises
<J_E_Smith71> This is 90 mins
<Kurra> erf
<Kandarihu|Zoro> Pale_Horse, wow. Good point there

<Megalomanic> So much for containment.
<SafariMonkey> Pale_Horse: :O that's stupis unless it's a cartoon
<Biltzwing> when was then made?
<DocSane> I love how huge this "sub" bridge is.
<Tovler> It was a bad idea to watch Poultrygeist so soon before watching this.

<pony_7255> short credits are short
<Randomiser> MegaPony
<CrazyHippie> Hi SafariMonkey
<thegt90> ascent media we climax befor we even started
<Kurra> American commercials are better than this movie.
<Midnight_Fyre> Meanwhile: Good idea. I bet noone would even notice
<Reactor> Ghosties: Humanity won
<fluttercry> 05,15THIS MOVIE IS FICTION
<Sumica> 00,10it was a draw, mankind won
<Conyst> yes
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ghosties, they both just.....stopped
<Dark92Enigma> So......for a flik starring a SHARK vs. an OCTOPUS......i'm pretty much underwhelmed.........the acting is horrible, the plot is nonsense, and the way they forced the GLOBAL WARMING in this movie is so forced, as much as the pointless scenes and the ending.............I would complain more about it but.......IT'S OVER NOW! THIS IS THE WORST MONSTER MOVIE EVER :[ 3/10
<Wubstep> SEAPONIES
<J_E_Smith71> Ghosties: No one. They both died
<Svettponny> The audience won, once the credits started rolling.
<Biltzwing> never AGAIN
<Lunar_Brony> OJ my self-insert mary-sue un-original HiE is better than this.
<Mozdoc> Oh yes, no animals were harmed in this production. Lest someone out there actually care about a giant shark and octopus.
<Ghosties> 04Yay for Humanity
<Megalomanic> In movies this bad, nobody wins.
<Dark92Enigma> SafariMonkey: 86. AND I LIKED IT
<Wubstep> SEAPONIES ALWAYS WIN

<AlienWarhead> Ghosties the octopus won, but then he died of old age and blood loss
<CrazyHippie> I saw this movie
<Biltzwing> U SUCK MOVIE
<CrazyHippie> it sucked
<Conyst> I was born in 86
<Ghosties> 04Poor Octopus :'(
<SafariMonkey> Svettponny: I was going to say overall the audience lost...
<Randomiser> This movie is very deep it shows that if you fight war like the shark and octopus you both die there is no winner in war that is why i like this movie good theme
<OJ> Lunar_Brony: You've given me hope
<Rookeealding> the title is too good for this movie

<superretroworld> DocSane: then i wonder why the shows called my little pony?
<otakon> Biltzwing: babies aren't mean, they don't know better
<DocSane> And everyone assumes Pinkie is retarded.
<J_E_Smith71> meatloaf: There's a whole new season, maybe she'll have her chance
<CrimsonPhoenix> fluttercry, pretty sure that's been done before

<fluttercry> 05,15DocSane That's actually a good question. I tend to stay away from people like her IRL
<Megalomanic> Pinkie looks good in flour.

<weeping_pegasi82> germans not bad
<Katalenic> hush hush?lol]
<XylemTube> damn they sound pissed

<richfiles> There's a tidal wave... But the rest of us global and american broinies countered with tidal waves of our own! :)
<cachi01> this one is good
<Dark_Horst> eddmario: we dont have your fairy vocal chords B)
<otakon> I like it
<Katalenic> i think fluttershy is cute in this one :3
<Nyst> It's weird for niconico to be slow. In anything.
<otakon> keeps with the tempo
<Dr_Fumbles> My favorite dub is English. Which country is English again?
<Fenr> argh
<cachi01> Dr_Fumbles: mexico

<VenHur> AMERICA, BITCHES!
<eddmario> Woah, the Italian version sounds almost EXACTLY like the English version.
<otakon> Dr_Fumbles: dude stop complaining about it
<Nyst> You'd have expected at least a poorly animated miku video with pony models.
<Dr_Fumbles> otakon: About what?
<DaringDerpy> english is for casuals
<[Alpha]> D:
<Kurra> whut...
<XylemTube> this one is not as good
<cachi01> i dont like the voice they gave to sweetie belle in the latin spanish dub
<otakon> Dr_Fumbles: all the foreign language
<Nyst> Germanbelle was really good.
<Katalenic> this one is not bad but the brazilian version...
<otakon> this one is okay
<otakon> but the Italian one was best so far
<Dr_Fumbles> otakon: But I love them! I was just joking...
<Katalenic> otakon Eeyup

<StinkomanFan> Better than waking up in TF2 I guess. :s

<Katalenic> :D
<Nyst> These guys have good CGI. They should team up with the other guys who made the City 17 movie, they had great combine and rebel costumes.
<cuddly_kittehs> both are mute
<cuddly_kittehs> :D
<Dark_Horst> mutes, UNITE!

<StinkomanFan> inb4 they meet the Pyro\
<Kurra> They are??
<Kurra> I didn't know! :o
<Shammy> Kurra: cause they never talk in game so they are considered mutes
<bronyberg> the most epic thing ever
<Dark_Horst> Kurra: they never spoke int heir games
<Kurra> Oh well... :/
<eddmario> Kurra: Yep, just like Jak was in his first game.
<DaringDerpy> "No worries! We are from the internets!"
<VenHur> If this was real, I would hugs Valve.
<Katalenic> Kurra they never speak in the game so yeah they are
<cuddly_kittehs> pysgun owns all!
<Dr_Fumbles> I love how Chell is totally nonchalant about the state of the world she desperately tried to escape to.
<[Alpha]> We need to show this to valve
<cuddly_kittehs> :D
<Sumica> 00,10shotglass
<diddutz> holy shit O.o
<cachi01> Kurra: chell is confirmed to be mute
<eddmario> I don't remember that gun...
<Spikewithamustach> You suck:D
<richfiles> Don't you recal... The talknig part of Chell's brain makes her jump
<Syl|gaming> ouch
<L_Y_R_A> lol
<Wubstep> Wut
<VenHur> And plus, if THIS camed out, it'll be Half Life AND Portal 3 at the same time. Makes sense.
<cuddly_kittehs> Dr_Fumbles: cause she just left her endless expermients. she is to mistifed by nature and the outside to concern hereslef just yet

<Kurra> YES THIS
<sonicdude558> always
<SnipsandSnails> oooookay...
<cachi01> children of the night
<sonicdude558> song > video
<L_Y_R_A> @_@
<otakon> CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THIS IS DONE!
<richfiles> I was so hoping this would be released by Nightmare Night
<NocturnalBlade> Sumica: agreed lol
<Katalenic> oh i love this one
<[Alpha]> man they are still not done with this and they released a teaser trailer aboutt 45 second long of this
<Dken2021> Sumica hey, art takes time
<otakon> richfiles: you can't rush somethinglike this
<cuddly_kittehs> I could sing this
<Sumica> 00,10you know they are just waiting for a big event to realease it by now
<[Alpha]> with color
<cachi01> [Alpha]: that was 2 months ago :/
<L_Y_R_A> yes mother f the night...you command me...i shall obey...
<Katalenic> can someone say what is the name of this video?
<[Alpha]> I know
<otakon> Sumica: maybe... like S3 premiere?
<eddmario> Sumica: Like next saturday?
<Dken2021> and you try and draw uptenth amount of frames
<Sumica> 00,10proably
<cachi01> Katalenic: children of the night
<Sumica> 00,10which is silly
<otakon> Dken2021: minimum of 24 per second
<Katalenic> thx cachi01
<Sumica> 00,10cause it will be over shadowed by real thing
<eddmario> The person singing this probably could be Luna's singing voice in the show
<otakon> but that's traditional cell animation
<otakon> eddmario: i think so
<Wubstep> o. o Th
<otakon> I'm not sure how it works with Flash
<Sumica> 00,10they were almost donw with this 2 months ago
<cachi01> eddmario: the person singing this is a disney girl
<Wubstep> That Voise Crak*
<Wubstep> Crack*
<Wubstep> Jesus -_-
<cachi01> the voice crack is just awesome
<SnipsandSnails> I'm waiting for this, Season 3, SWAG.MOV, and Fighting Is Magic.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I wonder what is Fighting is Magic up to, now.
<otakon> Sumica: finishing touches on a project by a small team takes time
<richfiles> Flash has so many shortcuts to create self repeatig cycles. Ou then just twaak and assemble the bits.
<[Alpha]> I really wanted to see it done by halloween. It would have been so awesome
<Sumica> 00,10true but given the speed they had been going at.
<otakon> it would have been
<Dken2021> Spell-of-Gaming more boring updates and whatnots
*cachi01 has the leaked fighting is magic
<Sumica> 00,10my bet is long done and just draging it out now
<otakon> Sumica: unforseen complications perhaps?
<eddmario> I dont' know why, but Luna in this preview reminds me of Digimon: Tamers for some reason.
<Sumica> 00,10posably, but they have been updateing other projects
<richfiles> I've never played it, but i also have the leaked verion of FiM
<eddmario> I guess cause the animation of her mouth looks like Guilimon's
<Wubstep> O This xP
<L_Y_R_A> <_>
<eddmario> Ugh, this AGAIN?
<StinkomanFan> WOONA
<flutterchu> hooray, time for a bit of dashie
*cuddly_kittehs brings a giant box of tissues
<sonicdude558> I was not totally going to snag a copy of Fighting is Magic at Canterlot Gardens...
<otakon> OH NO NOT THIS
<cuddly_kittehs> hey
<SpeccyRush> inb4 ManUp.jpg
<[Alpha]> No....the sadness :'(
<Spell-of-Gaming> NO
<AJIsAwesome> For some reason, it took me until the animated preview to realize that the one asleep was Celestia. :S
<otakon> cuddly_kittehs: can..can I have some?
<cachi01> how can this be sad?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR TISSUES
<SnipsandSnails> I tried to get the leaked fighting is magic but...honestly Windows 7 is so mean
<Sumica> 00,10radda radda manup radda radda
<cachi01> this is happy as fuck
<otakon> cachi01: it's the music
*AttackWithHugs hands out tisses to the chat
<SnipsandSnails> I hear this song in Up.
<Wubstep> Wait Spitfire would Of been a filly then o_o
<Spell-of-Gaming> This is more depressing if you already heard the song in Up
<richfiles> I have it somewhere on my Mac. Now that my PC is up and running, I should give it a go, just to see what it's like.
<otakon> Sumica: dude I KNOW WHAT THIS WAS ATTACHED TO ORIGINALLY. Seriously if you don't get teary eyed at that scene in 'UP' you have no soul.
<eddmario> I wonder if any of the people who got the leaked Fighting is Magic copies hacked into it to see if there was anything hinting at the future characters
<cachi01> otakon: oh yeah. up can make a victory something sad
<otakon> also I do like the animation here
<cachi01> eddmario: i checked the files
<cachi01> eddmario: theres nothing hidden
<[Alpha]> damn
<richfiles> I swear, my 3D glasses fogged up at the theater when I saw this from UP
<cachi01> richfiles: i hate when that happens XDD
<cuddly_kittehs> D:
*eddmario never saw UP
<Sumica> 00,10learn to seprate meenings otakon

<Lunar_Brony> As much as I love RD, there's one video I would consider "sad". I'm not sure what the name is, but it has Pinkie Pie and the music from the "Dead Island" trailer
<eddmario> cachi01: out of 10, what would you give the movie? Also, no spoilers please.
