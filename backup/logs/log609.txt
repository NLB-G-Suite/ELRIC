<MDL> these were more judgemental times. anything not "normal" is looked upon with scorn by man.
*fluttershyFTW hugs gollums
<AJIsAwesome> MrBen: You'll see why.
<PitViper> Yes no hard feelings whatsoever...
<Fenr> no hard feelings killyoukillyoukillyoudamnhobit not at all
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> No hard feelings, ata all>_>
<MrBen> AJIsAwesome: I pretty much already know.
<cratorkid> Combustiblelemons: he would strangle you and take the ring
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> *at
<Michael> sauron is now mad
<AJIsAwesome> MrBen: Allright.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The battle at Helm's Deep was edited down from twenty hours of footage, shot over a 4 month period with the rain machine battering down on the cast.
<Combustiblelemons> i don't have the ring >.>
<trackerzod> Sam=Twilight, i knew X was evil
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sauron BE AAAAAAANGRY
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gandalf's line near the end declaring that "The Battle of Helm's Deep is over; the Battle of Middle Earth is about to begin" is paraphrased from part of one of Winston Churchill's most famous speeches of the Second World War, of June 18th 1940: "...the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin."
<OohShiny> and... To Be Continued
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: There were so many extras used in the sequences at Helms Deep, and the filming went on for so many months that almost all the extras and principal actors got t-shirts reading "I survived Helms Deep". There were so many of these shirts that extras would often meet other extras in New Zealand's main cities because they would recognize the shirts.
<MrBen> dat buffer
<pikoRing> Fl00ter41: And potted plants are prisoners!
<DaringDerpy> well...you lose
<CriticKitten> HA
<fluttershyFTW> :O
<CriticKitten> That would be an awesome shirt
<Combustiblelemons> wow XD
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> I want that shirt.
<turtlegod98> Dont you just hate it when people quote "my preasious" but they don't know his name?
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the scene where Aragorn has washed up on the shore of the river that he fell in, the dialogue was originally in English. But Liv Tyler was entranced by the Elvish language, and since both characters and actors knew how to speak it, she talked Peter Jackson into letting them translate the script for that scene. Everyone agreed that it turned out much better her
<Gimli> 1,11way than the way it had been originally planned.
<Riders> Do the credits last 5 days like Fellowship of the Ring
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Body count: 468
<CriticKitten> No way it's that low.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Hell yeah Sam
<TheMaster> the elvish parts are pretty cool
<fluttershyFTW> any one up for an orc eating contest then
<FillyFlam> Man, this movie. It's been too long.

<CriticKitten> The orcs had 10k troops, didn't they?
<Fl00tersh41> pikoRing: Gardens are extermination camps1
<Combustiblelemons> Gimli don't you mean 10468?

<OohShiny> lol
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Sergio_Scriptor> poor smeagol :'( he is just mis-understood
<OohShiny> he can't break the wood
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15It's the number of deaths that you actually see on screen

<andy> stab out his eyesies!!!
<Dark92Enigma> EPIC GOLLUM TIME
<turtlegod98> 0_0
<CriticKitten> YesNONO
<OohShiny> Gollum is Tardy again
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> SHElob
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Peter Jackson and producer Barrie M. Osborne actively campaigned for Andy Serkis to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Gollum. Academy regulations, however, forbid an actor to be nominated when he is not physically to be seen on screen, despite Serkis' active input into the role.
<Fl00tersh41> thanks for reminding Gollum of giant spider Faramir
<turtlegod98> That feeling when you talk to yourself.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Rendering Gollum would often take six hours for one shot, so WETA would leave the shot to render over night and check the results in the morning. Every now and again a computer glitch would occur, for instance, one morning the team woke up to find every hair on Gollum's head standing upright in a sort of punk looking afro, or his eyes would pop in and out of his
<Gimli> 1,11head as he spoke.
<RivaLz> Smeagol sounds like a great plan
<fluttershyFTW> dont do it
<Zephyr> Love this shot
<fluttershyFTW> :(

<RivaLz> Azuredragon wonderful! *claps* xD
<Sergio_Scriptor> 10/10
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: It was clear to the writers from the very beginning that the entire final sequence of the third novel would be not be a part of this film, but open the third. Also, the confrontation with a defeated Saruman at Isengard was deemed to be too anti-climatic, and therefore moved to the third film as well. This tactical move meant the battle for Helms Deep became this
<Kothen> Half an hour of credits incoming / 10
<Gimli> 1,11film's natural climax.
<andy> this signals beddtime i think
<Gollum> "Toss Me"/10

<Michael> 10/10
<AlienWarhead> bye sergio
<Dark_Horst> so retunr of the king tomorrow?
<AJIsAwesome> BRB, guys. Have to get dog food.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Though this is the film that carries the title of the middle volume, scenes from the book "The Two Towers" are actually spread across all three films. Boromir's death scene and funeral, and the beginning of Aragorn's pursuit of the Orcs, made up the first chapter of the book, but were used at the end of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Scenes
<Gimli> 1,11after the Battle of the Hornburg (Helm's Deep), up to the part where Gandalf sets out with Pippin towards Minas Tirith, were moved toThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, as were all scenes involving Frodo and Sam up to the part where Frodo is captured by Orcs.
<Kandarihu> I slept through way too much of it. Mom did her best to fill in what she could, but frankly I don't even know WHAT needs to be filled in.

<ShadowQuill> MLP EPISODE NEXT
<Tamazarashi> WOO HOO
<Ryunosuke> mdl actually, this is a very good adaptation of a novel
<Gimli> 1,11Correction: Physically, he didn't play the character of GOLLUM. He played the Hobbit of Smeagol. It was too short of a role to warrant an oscar. (fucking copouts)
<CriticKitten> MDL: Because if he doesn't like these films, he doesn't know what the hell he's on about.
<ShadowQuill> I just mist LotR? OH COME ON
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Yeah, the Academy Awards are bullshit
<TheMaster> LOTR is the latest addition to epic literature
<PillowPoni> Dumblewhore: Will you stream that song They're Taking The Hobbits To Isengard after the credits?
<Kothen> But it's the same character......
<OohShiny> PillowPoni and you are a brony at the same time you did that?

<ShadowQuill> fluttershyFTW: WE ARE WATCHIING MLP EPISODE NEXT
<Gimli> 1,11SILVERSCREENS MOVIE REVIEW: Just like the first film, this was a great adaptation to a great book. I haven't even atempted to read Two Towers, but from what I've seen, what's left out or replaced was done so with good reason and smoothed over very well. Another 10/10 from me.
<pikoRing> Fl00tersh41: Well I'm out of ideas.
<PillowPoni> OohShiny: Yep.
<OohShiny> PillowPoni so the show sucked in that time
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dang, I'm late D:
<fluttershyFTW> mmk
<MLP_Brovakiin> I saw no two towers in the same shot 5/10
<Fl00tersh41> pikoRing: Ditto

<DocSane> Now I demand ponies to enjoy here in the rain forest!

<TheMaster> there probably won't ever be as incredible a series as lord of the rings. Tolkein literally invented fantasy as a genre as weknow it
<pikoRing> Gimli: So do I! : D
<MDL> after seeing this film again and re-living the joy of watching it, i've decided to get the books. should be good fun.
<Rohan> Gimli: who were you yesterday i missed the movie
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Thanks ShadowQuill- anone have any ideas what time the film is?
<TheMaster> everything you know and think of with 'fantasy' comes from tolkein
<PillowPoni> Gimli: Saw that image before.
<ShadowQuill> Gimli: Seems legit
<Gimli> 1,11I was Gimli yesterday
<Major> Gimli: so what would it be if it was Jurrasic Park?

<OohShiny> AlienWarhead I don't get it
<otakon> Where was Gondor?/10
<DocSane> I think
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> AlienWarhead: :D
<PillowPoni> Dumblewhore: I thought the same thing about them. Changer her mind and make her watch them with you
<otakon> also, dammit I missed most of it :P
<DocSane> lotR was this generation's Star Wars.
<fluttershyFTW> where was gondor when we needed to fin waldo
<otakon> but I already own the extended cuts on BR so I don't mind
<Gimli> 1,11Dumblewhore: To be fair, if you aren't into fantasy movies, then it would seem really uninteresting and tedius.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> OohShiny: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0929632/
<ShadowQuill> MUST we watch ALL the credits?
<fluttershyFTW> find*
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15This is an awesome way to end my summer.
<TheMaster> whichisfunny because lotr isa lot older then star wars
<OohShiny> DocSane LotR is older than star wars
<AlienWarhead> OohShiny It is from a movie called precious
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I missed the ending, I knew that sliced cucumber was too good to be true :P
<Leadhoof> ...wait a sec. Did I miss The Two Towers?
<Rohan> why does everyone care where was Gondor , what about me D:
<therainbowvortex> hey everypony what i miss
<otakon> Dumblewhore: if it was Doctor Who your erection would have been seen from space...
<TheMaster> LOTR was published in the 1940s
<pikoRing> Dumblewhore: Yeah, I have to be honest, I thought they were boring too before I really watched them here. But the last time I tried to watch them was when I was 8.
<DocSane> As opposed to, you know, Star Wars.
<Gondor> lolRohan
<otakon> therainbowvortex: everything
<TheMaster> Tolkein invented middle earth while he was fighting in world war1
<Gondor> You don't have any friends, Rohan, nobody likes you
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> You were just at the right place, Rohan:)

<CriticKitten> Gimli: I'm....not sure I can agree. This film is pretty much the definition of a great film. Well developed, lots of action where it counts, and everything is executed well.

<Rosfox> That was scary?
<[SWAG]Haku> COOL STROY BRO
<Zawan> has all of the stream begun to like seaponies?
<AJIsAwesome> WHAT A STORY MARK
<LordDerpington> Still a better horror story than Twilight. Wait...
<OohShiny> Pony Land...
<desertman2> That's a ghost story?
<Tamazarashi> THIS SCARY STORY IS A BASIC EPISODE OF G4
<haberdash> still a better ending than ME3
<OohShiny> Tamazarashi you're right
<OohShiny> dat soundtrack
<DocSane> See, nothing about this requires them to be ponies.
<AJIsAwesome> desertman2: Of course. That dragon was Ghost, the shape-shifting reptilian!
<TrixieMuffin> dont get your parents , the "fearless" squire will run away......WHAT ?
<Sno> There's nothing wrong with the shame of the old gen, however the colour scheme... Yuk!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> AND THEN THE PLANE WENT INTO A TALSPIN N' CRASHED INTO A HILSIDE AND EXPLODED INTO A FIREBALL AND EVERYPONY DIED!! D:
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Except for me...

<Kandarihu> They're so bipedal
<OohShiny> When I was a little filly and the sun was goin doooooown...

<DocSane> Kandarihu: I hate the bipedalism.
<Zawan> ^
<PinkiePieYoshi64> and my seat back in full upright position D:
<OohShiny> this song is quite good
<DocSane> Kandarihu: And the lazy song writing.

<OohShiny> sorry shadow
<OohShiny> just a favor for the fellow brony
<otakon> Ghosties: why?
<Kandarihu> Ghosties, really?
<otakon> Ghosties: tell us WHY!
<prince-dari> otakon, why do you think?
<prince-dari> Pony shirt

<ShadowQuill> A girl in my class wore a Rainbow Dash shirt, and I was too shy to ask...
<otakon> Oh a pony shirt
<Ghosties> 04She was wearing this: http://th08.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2012/184/2/0/my_derpy_t_shirt_by_bayleef10-d55w9d5.jpg

<OohShiny> this woman, I need to find her
<ShadowQuill> prince-dari: I know, I had the same reaction...
<Squallken> im watching Friendship is Gic: What a Story Mark Crusaders
<NullMaidix> trackerzod: I hear humans are allergic to weaponized friendship
<prince-dari> trackerzod: Quickly mutating strain of deadly virus
<ShadowQuill> Squallken: GREAT YTP
<prince-dari> :D
<Ponies47> Ghosties: Sweet :3
<AJIsAwesome> I met a little girl that caught the 20% Cooler shirt I was wearing.
<Ghosties> 04I was pretty amused and surprised, I never thought I'd see someone in my neck of the woods wearing a FiM shirt
<OohShiny> NullMaidix do you mean the Friendship Cannon?
<ShadowQuill> Save Derpy is a sad video...
<prince-dari> Did she notice your double take? :P

<Squallken> random quote: "Evil beware, we have waffles"
<Ghosties> 04Oh, and later she was behind me in the line and she had a case of corona beer
<Azuredragon> Example-
<NullMaidix> Quick_Thinker: there was just an ice cream truck parked outside the neighbor's house for like 15 minutes while all the children at their block party bought ice cream... I was considering the thought of walking out while eating from my half-gallon of bruster's I have in the freezer
<ShadowQuill> Squallken: Raven
<Azuredragon> #t=5m6s
<OohShiny> Take more emotions and cry some more! https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=9U0UUDy_5ik&NR=1

<NullMaidix> I was cleaning the entirety of the movie
<OohShiny> just kidding anyway

<ShadowQuill> NO WAIT DO NOT PASTE THIS
<MALK> I LIKE TRAINS
<TheKoreanBrony1354> MLP_M1KE13
<Reikim> For whatever reason, five-hour shifts are more strenuous than both six- and four-hour shifts.
<Ponies47> linsett: No prob :P
<doctorwhooves64> just post a bunch of youtube vids on here
*OohShiny runs over MALK with a train
<Dark92Enigma> Shadow If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve I'd have come here sooner and never leave.............Yes. I, Love, Everythiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!

<DerpyMuffins> WW2 ponies http://derpy.me/EJzVe
<linsett> <Polydunami> I like this site, but I don't understand how movie nights work. The newletter says Despicable Me, and they show Lord of the Rings.
<OohShiny> So sit back my dear, and if it's all the same
<LoGaN> hi
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905: I thought I saw some weird Japanese commercials, but this takes the cake.
<OohShiny> just sit back and relax, WHILE I EAT YOUR BRAINS!
<Reikim> By the end, I'm basically smiling by reflex and looking right through them.
<sub06905> AJIsAwesome: :D
<LoGaN> hi SuperBrony64
<Meanwhile> More to the point people who are twonks.
<Polydunami> Did I say that, linsett?
<OohShiny> HA HA HA YUMMY BRAINS!
<Jmo4267> Dat Allegr0

<Canadian_Brony> hi Allegr0
<Allegr0> hey everypony!
<Reikim> Most of them are pretty understanding, especially if I have the "please don't hurt me I'm new" sign.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> SuperBrony64
<ShadowQuill> OohShiny: SHUT UP STOP QUOTING THAT
<AdamTheDuck> Yay hi Allegr0
<linsett> OohShiny naaa naaa naa gonna eat your braiinss
<OohShiny> Sup Allegr0
<Ponies47> Hey Allegr0! Wazzup? :P
<Legolas> >make it in to the nether >get attacked as soon as you appear
<ShadowQuill> Bad OohShiny!
<SuperBrony64> TheKoreanBrony1354: Yesh? :)
<Canadian_Brony> hi Leadhoof. There will be stream in 15 minutes
<Polydunami> Oh hey Allegr0

<TheKoreanBrony1354> did yous add me
<ShadowQuill> Allegr0, what's up!
<Leadhoof> Okiedokie. Thank you.
<Meanwhile> That's pretty much the nether in a nutshell T.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and i forget to carry arrows
<ShadowQuill> Will there be a stream>
<Reikim> Congrats, Trix. Welcome to the Nether.
<SuperBrony64> I'm not home o.o TheKoreanBrony1354
<linsett> <Polydunami> Yeah....but can somepony plz explain how that works?
<MALK> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSRdlGr8UO8
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ohh
<Meanwhile> You'll get seen by a ghast and there goes your health bar.
<Reikim> I can usually deal with the Nether in steel gear and running fast.
<Polydunami> The newsletter is not working at the moment, linsett.
<ShadowQuill> MALK: I like MAD magazine more
<Meanwhile> I deal with it by playing on creative mode.
<Fluffle_Puff> Is anyone streaming ?
<Ponies47> Allegr0: Sweet. I'm happy because my father is allowing to install Steam on his computer which is great because now I get to play Steam games on a much better and faster computer. I still haven't play MvM yet.
<ShadowQuill> Fluffle_Puff: HELL NAW
<linsett> <Polydunami> Oh okay thanks for telling me
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i carried a lot of stone so i build a house around my portal
<Reikim> That works too.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Fluffle_Puff not for another 15 minutes
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ-CaLiXGp8
<Meanwhile> That works assuming the ghast don't blow it to bits.
<MALK> ShadowQuill magazines arent on youtube
<Reikim> Another valid point.
<Polydunami> Also, linsett, you don't need to type in the brackets around my name. Makes people think I was the one who said that.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> can't destroy stone
<Fluffle_Puff> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf5ukMJO2cY&feature=plcp
<ShadowQuill> MALK: ...I know
*sub06905 wonders if SuperBrony64 actually put the luna cutie mark on his flank :D
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: I LOVE SOUL EATER
<Meanwhile> Noted for future referance.
<Reikim> I thought ghasts hurl explosives?
<SuperBrony64> sub06905: O U
<linsett> Polydunami Oh I'm sorry I keep on doing that....
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not enough to destroy stone
<Meanwhile> They do, but apparently.
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: so do i ... SYMETRY
<TheKoreanBrony1354> BronySith
<linsett> <AJIsAwesome> Exacliburrrrrrr
<Polydunami> No worries :D
<sub06905> :3
<Meanwhile> As long as there's something between you and them they won't shoot anyway.
<Reikim> Build a castle in the Nether to hold back the hellspawn.
<Bronysith> linsett: FOOL
<AJIsAwesome> linsett: I AMMA LOOKING FOR HIM, I AM THE UNITED KING
<Meanwhile> They only fire if they can see you.
<AJIsAwesome> linsett: I AMMA GOING TO CALIFORNIA!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> meh too lazy i'll just take a nether fortress when i found one
<Meanwhile> Which interestingly enough, they cannot do through glass.
<linsett> AJIsAwesome Exaclibur, from the united king, I'm looking for her, I'm going to California~
<Allegr0> so what's everyone up to? :P
<otakon> not much Allegr0
<Jim> oh lookie people :)
<Polydunami> Sleep.
<Reikim> Maybe they see with sound?
<Canadian_Brony> I'm watching "Whose Line"
<AJIsAwesome> Allegr0: Not much.
<otakon> Allegr0: stream issues happened throughout the movie
<Polydunami> I had a rather exhausting week
<otakon> I'm watching Music Movies
<Canadian_Brony> BAM funny stuff
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg0vrP4h88c&feature=related
<otakon> on TGWTG
<TheKoreanBrony1354> BronySith
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Hope you can sit back and relax.
<Reikim> Sound would bounce right off of glass, I think.
<SuperBrony64> I'll make a deal that if I break over 100 followers on Twitter, I'll place one of every MLP tattoo I have on my body :) (Only the tattoos I have at least two of >>)
<Squallken> @otakon be sure to watch the Hunchback review of music movies
<linsett> Yay for weird ass Japanese ads: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=fvwp&NR=1&v=Oq8xuVnB-Pk
<ponies_8989> chat derp?
<otakon> Squallken: that's what I'm doing
<Meanwhile> Interesting idea, but I'm more inclined to chalk it up to the programming team not changing the general block detection.
<Squallken> you will love it
<otakon> Squallken: I'm enjoying it atm
<doctorwhooves64> so many youtube vids
<otakon> I like Hunchback quite a LOT
<Reikim> That works too.
<Polydunami> No, I was with a group of friends and we did volunteer work throughout the past week :P

<Reikim> I've only seen the standard overworld mobs, one ghast, and a horde of pigmen.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm glad MLP has spread to even Japan.

<OohShiny> not should, I mean, you guys could
<linsett> Until I realized it makes no sense.
<Reikim> And Jim left?

<Canadian_Brony> brb, need more food
<Jim> I'm coming back in
<MALK> WTF IS THIS ABOUT?
<VenHur> GigabitHarmonie, Allegr0: Which game are you going to play next? LoL or TF2?

<Meanwhile> You won't want to play with us just yet then. Have fun.
<AJIsAwesome> Silverscreen: You are the first person I ever met who prefers Papa Johns over Pizza Hut.
<Reikim> I suppose we could always bug otakon or something.
<otakon> a's
<linsett> silverscreen Agreed. Domino's is just chemicals and crap.
<mitamaking> otakon: It's Maple Story, which seems to stink
<OohShiny> I think this site is blocking my IP...

<Reikim> otakon: Up for some MvM?
<Meanwhile> Could do.

<Meanwhile> His connection sucks all the time.
<linsett> The sounds I'm making are less than appropriate, lol
<Bronysith> Reikim: nah man, playing letgend of dragoon

<VenHur> GigabitHarmonie: Which game you're going for now?
<Silverscreen> 1,11I have Spore, but honestly, I don't like it. I like customization, but that game is nothing BUT customization, and it gets old after a while.
<NullMaidix> AJIsAwesome: and I was playing off the part where I just ran some indeterminate amount of miles, assumed to be in the 4 range
<AJIsAwesome> Silverscreen: You are awesome.
<linsett> Logic logic logic logic
<Reikim> Easy. Just pretend the game doesn't exist.

<Reikim> otakon: Sure. The one that isn't full.
<MALK> MVM
<CriticKitten> Silverscreen: And now there's another argument against WoW. It's called GW2.
<OohShiny> My stream is not working
<Reikim> otakon: You know the pass.
<Canadian_Brony> I can't play MvM . . .
<thrackerzod> THATS THE POINT GUYS
<Silverscreen> 1,11gw2?
<MASF123> my stream is blank.
<CriticKitten> Guild Wars 2.
<NullMaidix> OohShiny: if you'll take someone who hasn't played in... 2-3? years? I could roll a match

<Silverscreen> 1,11I haven't gone to any cons whatsoever. I wanted to go to Techocon, but I didn't have the money.
<Panda> comic con is pretty alright~
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I would try to go to the NY comic con, but I might be busy in the fall.
<Bronysith> GigabitHarmonie: Allegr0 come to dragoncon next week in atlanta please. i would love to meet you guys

<Yahooz> MO MONEY MO PROBLEMS
<linsett> Okay. Guys. You two wish to go to a pony con that's on the weekend of your birthday, but you're really young, and your parents aren't willing to pay for the ticket costs. What do?
<Canadian_Brony> TheKoreanBrony1354 TF2
<Derpy_Hooves> did i hear "low on cash"?
<Bronysith> GigabitHarmonie: Allegr0 thats okay, ill take pics for you guys
<Canadian_Brony> Yahooz no money IS a problem
<Vivix> Desucon is a tiny convetion in Oslo, like 200 bucks admittance?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Then you wouldn't be able to get to bronycon next year...
<mitamaking> Yahooz: A rich person said that while laughing

<TheKoreanBrony1354> IS THIS LIKE A TALK SHOW

<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie Derp?
<Silverscreen> 1,11I won't go to Anthrocon. MOre trouble than its worth.
<AJIsAwesome> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: Are you guys going to Canterlot Gardens?
<Canadian_Brony> WTF is Anthrocon?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> GigabitHarmonie what do you think about the Mann vs Machine Update? Not just about the Gamemode
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I almost started reading it in costa rica
<Slenderman> Oh god... 50 Shades of Grey?
<Canadian_Brony> forget i asked
<DerpyMuffins> Its not a bad read
<pwny> canadian_brony its a furry con
*Bronysith sticks his toungue in GigabitHarmonie s ear
<Silverscreen> 1,11Anthrocon is a convention for Furries to meet artists, writers and other furries.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Bronysith: O_O

<AJIsAwesome> EA or 4Kids
<Yahooz> Wipe out AOL
<Yahooz> 
<Bronysith> Allegr0: EA

<sonicandmario85> EA

<mitamaking> B P definitly
<CriticKitten> What's this about EA? Why are people saying EA?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> what do u hope for season 3
<Kandarihu> General Electric
<Yahooz> My question is a question
<sonicandmario85> DID G3 PONIES AIR ON FKIDS?
<Derpy_Hooves> Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: gangnam style or melbourne shuffle? :3
<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie Derp?
<Slenderman> What do you think of Slender Mane?
<sonicandmario85> 4
<sonicandmario85> *
<Kawaii_icybeauti> sonicandmario85: No, they were mostly DVD's and stuff
<AJIsAwesome> sonicandmario85: No. VHS only.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Unfortunately, the majority of furries that go to Furrycon are the ones that give the fandom a bad name. -_-
<CriticKitten> Is the question "which company is the biggest bunch of dicks"?
<Bronyhawk> Feeling better, Allegr0 ?
<CriticKitten> Because yeah sorry folks, but EA wins that hands fucking down
<Slenderman> What do you think of Slender Mane? Because I think I should make an alternate ending to it
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I'd wipe out MTV.
<linsett> Okay. Guys. You two wish to go to a pony con that's on the weekend of your birthday, but you're really young, and your parents aren't willing to pay for the ticket costs. What do?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> WOULD KILL SOUTH KORE (NOT) OR NORTH KOREA (YES BIG YES)
<DeadpoolDash> wow...talking about furries...awesome
<Yahooz> CriticKitten: Dicks sporting goods?
<ponies_8989> slender or ammnesia?
<Buytoast> My inner goddess!
<Bronysith> Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie of course you guys dont have the same bottom... you aint siamese twins.
<Slenderman> MEEEH
<pwny> loyality,luaghter,honest,genourosity,kindness,magic?
<Silverscreen> 1,11DeadpoolDash: Is there a problem?
<Panda> Never met a furry >.>
<XAX> Guys. The huntsman is the greatest weapon ever in the worlds to use in MvM.
<sub06905> GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0: if you could have any gun, which gun would you choose?
<Franek12354> If you had played minecraft so did you played Tekkit before?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Panda: well you have now.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> TheKoreanBrony1354: Wait, where in SK are you in?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> PLANTS VS ZOMBIES OR PLANTS VS ZOMBIES
<Buytoast> Furries are dangerous people Panda.
<DeadpoolDash> its just an interesting topic on the interwebs
<Panda> Silverscreen no no no i mean Irl
<TheKoreanBrony1354> YES IAM SOUTH KOREAN
<Polydunami> They're not even from Siam :P
<Canadian_Brony> Silverscreen I think he means IRL
<Meanwhile> This guy talks too much.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Ah.
<CriticKitten> EA has lost the very last of my faith when they vowed to destroy C&C forever. Now I want Ricotello drawn and quartered. :|
<Yahooz> brbz
<Kawaii_icybeauti> TheKoreanBrony1354: You lvie near the border?
<Meanwhile> And his voice is grating my ears.
<Panda> Buytoast pft, if Silverscreen is a furry, then they all cant be bad ^^ i like him.
<pwny> buytoast furries are awesome
<TheKoreanBrony1354> NO I LIVES IN AMERCIA
<KaitoThePony> Well I gots to go to bed......Bye every pony!!!!:D
<TheKoreanBrony1354> AMERICA*
<Canadian_Brony> g'night KaitoThePony
<AJIsAwesome> KaitoThePony: Night!
*Canadian_Brony lives in Canada
<TheKoreanBrony1354> KIITENS OR PUPPIES
<DerpyMuffins> Gigabitharmonie Favorite pony musicians?
<linsett> Night Kaito.

<Canadian_Brony> he dumb-f*cked
<Bronysith> DIE 4KIDS
<pony_9790> Pokemon is an exception :P
<mitamaking> 4Kids is already gone anyway
<Bronysith> FUCK YOU 4KIDS
<XylemTube> BURN BURN BURN TO THE GROUND WOOOOO
<flutter_spin> LOL
<Buytoast> Well as long as he isn't ruining other people's weddings or forcing people to be their pets via shock collar than he's alright then Panda.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> DREAMWORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Meanwhile> Reikim, T, Phase4, tell me it's not just me.
<Canadian_Brony> buck Pokemon. We have ponies!
<Slenderman> What do you think of Slender Mane? Because I think I should make an alternate ending to it...
<mitamaking> oh new comics
<Slenderman> YES
<Phase4> ?
<AJIsAwesome> XylemTube: I was going to make that joke............:'(
<Slenderman> AHAHHAHHH
<Yahooz> My question: PSY breaks into your house and calls you "sessy lady" what do?
<Slenderman> NO
<linsett> Any fanfics you guys recommend?
<Phase4> i'm fine with it
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dayum, campfire song is stuck in my head :P
<AJIsAwesome> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: Are you guys going to Canterlot Gardens?
<Meanwhile> You're no help at all.
<Panda> Buytoast erm... you dont have to be a furry to have those kinks >.>
<Spell-of-Gaming> hai everypony :3
<Phase4> not ideal but i'm fine with it
<AJIsAwesome> Spell-of-Gaming: Hi!
<Phase4> reikim seems to have internet problems
<CiderIsForDrinking> Allegr0: What is the address for your wedding? We will watch through the windows >_>
<Buytoast> I didn't say you have to be.
<XAX> Monster. How should I feel.
<Bronysith> Allegr0: ...i can haz hugs?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Just like bronies, the furry fandom has those people that make them appear to be the spawn of satan. There's a lot of awesome and safe furry artwork out there, and people fail to acknowledge how furries have been in society for the longest time without any of the negative.
<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie Derp?
<linsett> You have a good Fluttershy impression. Y u no use it for comic relief.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> WHAT WOULD NAME YOUR KID
<Buytoast> Well yeah, that's a given Silverscreen.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> IF IT WAS A PONY
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Silverscreen: That's actually correct. Saberspark says that we actually get insulted in soem of the same ways as them.
<Buytoast> Just the bad furries are the kind of people who are truly horrific.
<Panda> Silverscreen ^^ Thank you. I dont know much about the furry community outside someones brief explaination.
<pwny> Monster or rockstar?
<Buytoast> Even I fear them.
<Yahooz> If MLP did not exist, what would you guys do?
<Panda> Buytoast whats there to fear?
<Slenderman> Just so you know, Slender has an updated version called Sanatorium.
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Explain.
<Derpy_Hooves> Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: i have two questions i would like answered, "Have you seen whare the hell is matt 2012"? and "What would you do if you played minecraft with Gavinfrom roosterteeth"?
<Canadian_Brony> I am neutral on this furry conversation.
<Panda> Yahooz I would be in college and still drawing XD
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I never knew what furries were.
<Buytoast> The bad furries will actually try to firce you into an orgy and shit.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ROOSTER TEETH
<Vivix> I like furry art, don't really care otherwise
<Buytoast> force*
<Polydunami> Oh geeze, Korean Brony, a pony can't bear a kid; ponies are not goats :|
<TheKoreanBrony1354> I LIKE MICHAEL
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't care about furries, honestly.
<Panda> Buytoast heh, I dont see the problem in that XD but thats personal preference
<linsett> You have a good Fluttershy impression. Y u no use it for comic relief.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm neutral for furries. Love and tolerate.
<Vivix> Polydunami: you made me laugh!
<Spell-of-Gaming> It's just like that secret club on the internet thing again.
<Canadian_Brony> Mmmph mmmph mmmmmm!
<Buytoast> I mean they rape you Panda.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Exactly. Which is why I find it hypocritical as hell for bronies to hate on furries and vice-versa. They have similar fandoms and at the very least should respect each other for holding their heads high against all the bullshit that they take.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ALEGR0 WOULD YOU WANNA BE FAT OR DUMB
<Yahooz> UMLIMITED POWAAAAAAAH
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Like that creepy dude I saw at bronyxon?
<Panda> Buytoast not rape if you want it ;)
<linsett> Sexual harrassment panda~
<Panda> linsett XD
<Bunny_Striker> T rex vs Giant Python
<Buytoast> But the people don't want that sonny boy.
<Yahooz> FICK!
<AJIsAwesome> GigabitHarmonie is best pyro.
<Yahooz> FICK IT TO HELL
<pony_9790> As long as they respect, I'm cool with it. It's when they start looking for trouble that makes it ridiculous :S
<Buytoast> One guy was practically enslaved via shock collar by two insane furry chicks.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Silverscreen: Agreed.
<pwny> pyro disproves
<Panda> AJIsAwesome TAKE IT BACK! Shizuka is best pyro!
<TheKoreanBrony1354> WHAT SFAVORITE SPORT
<Canadian_Brony> hi Nittany_Discord
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Could you try bronycon next year?
<Slenderman> I will say this again. What do you think of Slender Mane? Because I think I should make an alternate ending to it
<Panda> Nittany_Discord!!!!! how are you :D
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: oh hi there
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi.
<DerpyMuffins> Hi Nitty
<Bronysith> Allegr0: THANK YOU

<Kawaii_icybeauti> On nit, nice you stopped by.
<Panda> Nittany_Discord :( is something wrong?
<AJTheMightyGamer> hay Nittany_Discord
<Meanwhile> He's killing my braincells
<TheKoreanBrony1354> Alegr0 do u prefer peanut butter and jelly or jelly or peanut butter
<Silverscreen> 1,11...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Panda: Not really.
<flutter_spin> Can we hear your future wife?
<Yahooz> good answer
<Silverscreen> 1,11I'd probably be playing more Skyrim.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> imagine if MLP never exsisted....
<Shizuka> 13ping
<flutter_spin> SHIZ
<Spell-of-Gaming> PONG
<Yahooz> Shizuping
<Canadian_Brony> hi Shizuka. Pong.
<mitamaking> Hi Shizuka
<Meanwhile> Can't believe it took me that long to remember there's a mute function.

<Panda> >.<
<TheKoreanBrony1354> hi Shizuka
<sonicandmario85> Shizuka:HELLO
<Colt_45> Allegr0 How did you decide that it was time for marriage for you?
<Yahooz> Nope
<Canadian_Brony> Spell-of-Gaming No! That's my shtick!
<pony_9790> I'd be on LoL a lot lol
<Derpy_Hooves> Shizuka: your ping is no match for my pong :I
<Panda> Shizuka I didnt mean to ping you if you were busy >.<
<Yahooz> For me it doesnt
<Canadian_Brony> Derpy_Hooves No! That's my shtick!
<Colt_45> Allegr0: How did you decide that it was time for marriage for you?
<AJIsAwesome> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: Have you played Super Smash Bros.? If yes, which one do you prefer?
<Silverscreen> 1,11What negatives have you encountered since you joined the fandom?
<Yahooz> THAT VID IS AMAZING
<TheKoreanBrony1354> alegr0 do you love this all
<flutter_spin> I haven't seen it!!!! 2012 is out?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Yahooz: What vid?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> gavin
<cachi01|mobile> Pingas :I
<Spell-of-Gaming> Gavin
<Buytoast> Which fandom?
<XylemTube> how do you NOT know who Gaben is?
<Yahooz> Kawaii_icybeauti: where is matt 2012
<Polydunami> Well if My Little Pony never existed, little girls would still have Barbie... actually, that's kind of a bleak future :(
<superretroworld> anybody getting lag?
<Buytoast> the ponyfags or the furfags?
<Silverscreen> 1,11I, personally, have gotten into numerous arguments on what the fandom is, why the fandom is so large and how our content is NOT the spawn of satan. -_-
<TheKoreanBrony1354> RTX 2012
<Kawaii_icybeauti> This website would have never exsisted...
<flutter_spin> aw
<Yahooz> and yes AJIsAwesome, they have played.
<pwny> its a meme
<sonicandmario85> Allegr0:gaben is the creator of steam
<pony_9790> Silverscreen: When the heck they mention that? o.o
<Vivix> Silverscreen: I've actually never gotten flak for it, have met outsiders who don't like the show, but- nothing more than that
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ALEGR0 TWIX SWIRL OR LAYERD
<Derpy_Hooves> Allegr0 anf GigabitHarmonie: gav ing is the roosterteeth troll, and where the hall is matt, i will link that to you two in a bit
<sonicandmario85> NOT TODAY ZERG ....toy story much?
<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie Derp?
<Bronyhawk> Personal? Tube socks or Tube tops? o.O
<DerpyMuffins> Gigabitharmonie Who do you like more: Vinyl or Octavia?
<AJIsAwesome> Some bronies are bronies just because the show is good. If I hadn't encountered My Little Pony, I would've been even more depressed than I am now.
<pwny> Would you try gourmet insects?
<Bunny_Striker> How did you guys meet?
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: true
<Yahooz> Melee has a harder learning curve
<linsett> You have a good Fluttershy impression. Y u no use it for comic relief.
<ponies_8989> what is ur favourite shipping?
<Silverscreen> 1,11I prefer Brawl because of the extentions and has the most options. In terms of gameplay, Brawl is more fun, but Melee is better for competitive play.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> AJIsAwesome: Same. I would have never become close friends with my brony friend.
<Sumica> 00,10How much wood could a wood chuck, chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?
<Panda> Silverscreen ^^
<Canadian_Brony> hi Sumica
<Yahooz> Silverscreen: couldnt agree more
<Panda> Sumica ALL THE WOOD!
<Bronysith> Sumica: ... BOOT TO THE HEAD
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica alot
<TheKoreanBrony1354> IF HAD TO KILL KIRBY OR PIKACHU ( 1ST EVOULTION)
*Bronysith throws a boot at Sumica
<pony_9790> I like playing Brawl a lot. My main is Jigglypuff :)
<Buytoast> A woodchuck would chuck as much wood as it could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.
<AJIsAwesome> I've been through a lot stuff in life, and this show proved to me that there IS faith in humanity.
<linsett> Have you guys ever thought about what MLP would be like if MLP didn't exist?
<sub06905> :D
<Panda> linsett well... it wouldnt exist XD
<Canadian_Brony> wha . . .
<Yahooz> Nope. that would be Olimar
<Kawaii_icybeauti> linsett: I'm sorry, I really can't think about that....
*Sumica throws a boot shaped brick at Bronysith
<TheKoreanBrony1354> WHATS YOUR PET PEEVE
<superretroworld> GigabitHarmonie: Allegr0 got a favourite video game?
<linsett> Wait, I meant if the fanbase didn't exist.
<Polydunami> Seriously, the smash sound in 64 is the most wonderful sound in the world :D
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ALEGR0 WHATS YOUR PET PEVVE
<AJIsAwesome> I actualy like long throws. More invicibility frames.
*Bronysith eats Sumica s brick
<linsett> Sorry guys, that was a typo......
<Vivix> linsett: I personally would still watch it, I came across the show without the fandom
<Yahooz> OMG YES
<Panda> linsett well... we wouldnt know each other here >.> thats for sure.
<Yahooz> BEST ANSWER
<Sumica> 00,10kinky
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ALEGR0 FEBREZZE OR MAPLESTORY
<flutter_spin> SUMI
<AJIsAwesome> Best answer.
<superretroworld> ike is the best
<pony_9790> Yeah :S
<sonicandmario85> if MLP didnt exist this site probaly wouldent even exist..
<Bronysith> GNIGHT EVERYPONY, may the force be with you all, and may you pierce the heavens with your drills
<Silverscreen> 1,11ponies_8989: My favorite shipping...yeesh...Well, my OTPs would have to be Fluttershy and Big Mac, Twilight x Trixie, Applejack x Random Male Pony, Rarity x Spike, and Rainbow Dash x Male Wonderbolt.
<Yahooz> Metaknight is OP
<Sumica> 00,10hi flutter_spin
<AJIsAwesome> Bronyhawk: Night!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hate that as well.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That creates haters.
<flutter_spin> AND NIT
<Spell-of-Gaming> How much would Pinkie Pie pink pinkies pink Pinkie's pink pinkies.
<DerpyMuffins> GigabitHarmonie Favorite Shipping?
<Silverscreen> 1,11Yes. I don't like people that do that. It's annoying, and all it does and spawns more haters.
<pony_9790> I hate it when people shove to other people's throats :S

<Bronysith> Silverscreen: or how about braeburn and soarin?

<Sumica> 00,10LGBT?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Wait, can someone link that to me?
<Silverscreen> 1,11They're not doing it officially, but the bronies of the LGBT do it.

<pony_9790> There's a thing?
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transexual alliance.
<Kandarihu> They're trying to co-opt her?
<Buytoast> The problem is that Rainbow Dash has no confirmed sexuality.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ALEGR0 MITT ROMENY OR OBAMA
<Kawaii_icybeauti> lemme go check that out.
<Ryunosuke> simply because ANYTHING with a rainbow = LGBT is.... dunb?

<Ryunosuke> *dumb
<Sumica> 00,10try any thing once
<Yahooz> Why must ponies become subject of sexuality?
<XylemTube> Dashie is still best pony <3
<Kandarihu> Well, every canon romance is heterosexual.
<Yahooz> seriously?
<pony_9790> Huh, ain't that weird
<Buytoast> So they're basically forcing anythign rainbow to be their symbol.
<MASF123> my damn stream isn't working
<Silverscreen> 1,11Lauren Faust officially stated that, aside from pre-set characters, they don't have a set sexuality. So it's entirely fanon.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ALEGR0 MITT ROMENY OR OBAMA

<Prince_Blueblood> and a great decision that was
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like to think RD is straight.

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord eh ?
<MASF123> Even if she were bi or gay she would still be cool
<linsett> Any fanfics you guys would recommend?
<pony_9790> We have communication error!
<prince-dari> Ohai
<Buytoast> They would never consider making a gay pony.
<pony_9790> Oh, never mind :P
<Derpy_Hooves> Allegr0 ang GigabitHarmonie: let me rephrase my question, "What do you think of this http://www.indiegogo.com/Equestria "?!
<Vivix> I like Straight RD because she's so often gay, but fanon is different for each fic
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Going to try and fix those sprays.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ALEGR0 AND GIGABOT 4 EVER
<Yahooz> Unleash the S_M!!!!

<Buytoast> You saw the shitstorm when retard Mc Cross-Eyed accidently had a weird voice?
<pwny> lol the quitness
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's funny that there is a ton of lesbian shipping in the MLP fandom.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Personally, I see Twilight as becoming a Lesbian more than Rainbow Dash.
<MASF123> She's gay or bi in the fanverse
<Canadian_Brony> superretroworld it's all fanon, so it's all up to what we think
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ALEGR0 MITT ROMENY OR OBAMA
<Canadian_Brony> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT

<VenHur> Sorry I was gone. Internet connection.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> WHATS FAVORITE BAND
<Colt_45> APPLEPIE!!
<Cypresswolf> The Equestrian Island project did not take into account how much it would take to ship the supplies needed to built it in the first place, then there's upkeep, rent or property taxes....doomed to failure from the start
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ALEGR0 DO U LIKE K POP
<Silverscreen> 1,11lawl
<Quick_Thinker> so Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie did you get my message about me giving up a SMITE beta key?
<Colt_45> a claranet?..
<Derpy_Hooves> Cypresswolf: the equestria project was retarded
<VenHur> TheKoreanBrony1354: KISS, AC/DC, Backstreet Boys, etc.
<Yahooz> I can just imagine Allegr0 holding a clarinet at the bow of the titanic
<MASF123> is anyone's stream working?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Using genderswap magic, same-sex couples can have children (in MLP RP).
<TheKoreanBrony1354> ALEGR0 TF2 OR COUNTER STRIKE
<Ryunosuke> that being said, my favorite shipping atm, is either Twilight x human (Hands, Shackles and Friendship) or Twixie (Of Maids and Mistresses is good)
<Buytoast> Cypresswolf: Is that that whole lets buy an island and make a giant ass statue on it thing?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Nittany_Discord just a sec i'm in a match of MvM
<AJIsAwesome> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie: Have you guys heard of the Brony island?
<XylemTube> Vinyl x Octavia?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TheGreatAndPowerfulT: K.
<Cypresswolf> By what means could anyone get there to begin with - youre right Derpy_Hooves it was a foolish idea
<Silverscreen> 1,11My two favorites would be Fluttershy x Big Mac and Twilight x Trixie.
<mitamaking> Spike x Rarity
<Kawaii_icybeauti> TheKoreanBrony1354: Nirvana,wolfmother,Korn,Queen,Aerosmith.
<MASF123> Pinkie Sparrow

<pony_9790> o_O

<linsett> You guys like ELO?
<Polydunami> Spike and Rarity seems really creepy to me :S
<Silverscreen> 1,11I've seen enough furry porn to know that Spike x Rarity could work.
<Cypresswolf> Buytoast: yes
<Yahooz> Only DJ Fedex can ship
<XylemTube> CiderIsForDrinking: this
<Sumica> 00,10DarixDoctor
<TheKoreanBrony1354> IF YOU HAD TO MEET TARA STRONG OR ANDREA LIBMAN WHO WOULD IT BE
<Kandarihu> Well, the Spike x Rarity is onesided, though.
<Buytoast> Ahahaha
<Ryunosuke> but i think Bronystates favorite ship is otakon x anything :)
<Yahooz> Dari x Tennant
<Buytoast> They actually thought it would work out?
<Buytoast> Holy shit those people were dense.
<Sumica> 00,10there is artwork too Silverscreen, of the ofspring that is.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I can hear the ping from here.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A strange one was r63 Fluttershy (Butterscotch) x OC coupling where Butterscotch changed his gender and beared the child, but he wasn't Fluttershy as a girl.
<Kandarihu> Ryunosuke, that's off limits, though
<flutter_spin> nono. That kind of ship isn't allowed here
<linsett> Oh no....I'm not too good at this...
<Spell-of-Gaming> The Spike x Rarity fanbase makes me cringe.
<Yahooz> Was that a bane voice?
<Barbetos> Through the Eyes of Another Pony. My most favoritests fic
<Yahooz> 0_o
<MASF123> Niether because I'm pissed at either one of them.

<Dken2021> oooook....
<Barbetos> aginst the roolz
<MASF123> Sleepwaklers
<Kawaii_icybeauti> It's called the royal canterlot voice.
<Silverscreen> 1,11I apologize to those of you that don't like Shipping, but it is an inevitable part of this fandom. Best you can do is just ignore the conversation.
<prince-dari> SPIDERMAN.MP$
<Barbetos> You broke the ROOLZ!!

<MASF123> What the fuck is shipping?
<mitamaking> GigabitHarmonie: Do you know Allegr0's fiancé?

<pony_9790> What kind of music you guys like?
<Derpy_Hooves> Nittany_Discord: i have a question for you
<Yahooz> Best way to do Bane voice: Sosphisticated voice talking into a glass cup
<XylemTube> Canadian_Brony: i've used all caps before, never was a big deal before
<Yahooz> try it
<linsett> You have a good Fluttershy impression. Why don't you use it more often during your Steam playthrough?
<superretroworld> Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie hoe did you feel when you first became a brony?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Derpy_Hooves: Yes?
<pony_9790> Huh?
<linsett> Like for comic relief?
<Canadian_Brony> XylemTube I know, but spamming it is agianst the rules
<sub06905> :D
<prince-dari> Wut
<TheKoreanBrony1354> alegr0 did you get good grades when you were little
<Kandarihu> Shipping is an inevitable part of any fandom. I generally dislike the slash shipping. But any major fandom of a work with a high gender disparity is bound to have a lot of it.
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: Stop. That's NOT the definition of shipping. Shipping can be only romantic, too. Not just sexual.
<Ryunosuke> suddenly Sean Connery?
<CiderIsForDrinking> :D
<Canadian_Brony> dat Big Macintosh
<Dken2021> too bad, once the ship has been made, you can't deny it
<Kandarihu> It's naturally worse with Touhou.

<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie Derp?
<flutter_spin> ...for charity
<Buytoast> How lonely must you be?
<Vivix> Kandarihu: I'm the opposite- I usually can't enjoy straight shipping, though I definitely will enjoy it at times if it is really well written
<Yahooz> prince-dari: there was one on a poster at bronycon
<Spell-of-Gaming> Gensokyo - Where everyone is gay.
<mitamaking> Kandarihu: Avatar the Last Airbender is worst shipping, because it is all possible
<Slenderman> That... is ... BEAUTIFAL
<Ryunosuke> prince-dari = Sean Connery?
<Buytoast> To spend 2k on a pony picture.
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: What painting was it?
<Derpy_Hooves> Nittany_Discord: why are you Nittany and why are you Discord? :I
<AJIsAwesome> Neither:(

<flutter_spin> lol
<Sumica> 00,10robot chicken did it already
<Silverscreen> 1,11Buytoast: Okay, shipping is a lot, LOT more than just the fucking. There are tons of Shipping fanfics out there that only show the relationship and the love that's being put between the two characters. Your generalization is a bullshit description that's no better than how haters of the fandom call us Pedophile Manchildren.
<Kandarihu> Dken2021, except for three, yes.
<Ryunosuke> that... is not... pythagorum theorm
<pony_9790> I like this one: x equals -b + or - the square root of b square minus 4ac, all over 2a :P
<mitamaking> Silverscreen: But those are not that popular
<mitamaking> :p
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Silverscreen: I'm sorry, I started laughing at the pedophile manchildren :D
<Vivix> the nonfucking ones are sickly popular
<Yahooz> SCHOOL HOUSE ROCK FTW
<pony_9790> All that while in rhythm of "Pop Goes the Weasel" :D
<Dken2021> Kandarihu three? I never heard of these non-female characters
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Derpy_Hooves: Nittany comes from the mascot of my grad school Penn State (Nittany Lions). Discord comes from the MLP villain. My non-brony nick is Nittany_Tiger, a portmanteau of Nittany Lion and Tiger (of Clemson University where I got my undergraduate).
<Buytoast> I know Silverscreen. Doesn't mean people don't make them fuck in alot of it.
<CriticKitten> inb4 PedoPony
<mitamaking> School House Rocks, heck yeah
<Kandarihu> One guy only exists prior to a reboot, the second guy only exists in expanded universe, and the third is a cloud.
<MASF123> ...so shipping is clopfics? I'm confused. :/
<flutter_spin> good times. good times.
<Silverscreen> 1,11Nittany: Ironic, I"m thinking of going into Penn State.
<pwny> Explosions ors Implosions?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> alegr0 whats heavier the total amount of fanfics or 900 asian elephants
<Derpy_Hooves> Nittany_Discord: i was just dicking with you :P, i wasn't expecting an answer like that :3
<Yahooz> Conjunction Junction, whats your functionnn~
<Vivix> MASF123: no shipping is romance, clop is porn
<Silverscreen> 1,11I LOVE SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I only saw one...The bill one..:(
<Canadian_Brony> mitamaking ever heard of "Twilight's List"? IIRC, it is the most popular shipping story on FimFiction.net
<TheKoreanBrony1354> i do
<Buytoast> MASF123: It's pretty much just relationships.
<Colt_45> Allegr0: and company, would do you guys do for work outside of bronystate?
<MASF123> romance? ok
<mitamaking> 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30
<Spell-of-Gaming> TL;DR: Shipping isn't all sexual intercourse, if it is, it makes us all pedophiles.
<pony_9790> I saw that and conjunction. Ugh... lol
<sub06905> School House Rock <3
<Yahooz> Hookin up Words and Phrases and Clauses
<Canadian_Brony> MASF123 that is shipping
<Cypresswolf> :O No School House Rock? Blastphemy!
<prince-dari> Not heard of Dash drives
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's a good school. We all hate that paedophile coach as well.
<prince-dari> Lel
<Vivix> all of the mane 6 are over 21,
<Dken2021> my high school teachers had tapes of school house rock
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I did get to see bill nye and magic school bus in skool
<TheKoreanBrony1354> Alegro do you know whats superponybeat os
<Colt_45> Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie what r ur jjeerrrbbs?
<Ryunosuke> Spell-of-Gaming, there is a difference between Shipfics and Clopfics
<Dken2021> uggh
<Yahooz> that thing has WAAAAY to much support
<AJIsAwesome> Can someone clarify what Friendshipping is? I haven't heard of it before. I know of shipping, but I've never heard of Friendshipping.
<mitamaking> 6 million?
<pwny> My highschool sceince teacher still shows bill nye
<prince-dari> BronyState pirate boat is much better idea
<MASF123> Vivix, Lauren said they are under 4 years of age how the fuck are they 21?
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: friendshipping is just someone becoming friends
<Spriggals> WHERE IS THIS KICKSTARTER!
<Yahooz> Friendshipping is a prmance
<Polydunami> I remember when those shows were actually on, Kawaii_icybeauti xD
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Thanks.
<prince-dari> That's where all the BronyState gold proceeds are going
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ryunosuke: Yup. Shipfics usually just show the relationship of the indicated couple while clopfics are mostly sexual crap.
<Vivix> MASF123: all the mane six are independent adults
<superretroworld> Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie how did you feel when you first became a brony?
<Canadian_Brony> Kawaii_icybeauti I saw Bill Nye in school and Magic School Bus on TV. I also got to borrow VHS tapes from the library, most of them were Bill Nye and Magic School Bus.
<Slenderman> What do you think of Slender Mane? Because I think I should make an alternate ending to it
<Yahooz> prince-dari: dibs on captain... since i can actually sail
<Kandarihu> Vivix, I'm not sure if they're over 21. They're physically adults. But I'm thinking they might be like real ponies and have shorter lifespans than humans. That means they mature sooner.
<Silverscreen> 1,11SILVERSCREEN QUESTION: What do you think of the Love and Tolerate mantra?
<pony_9790> <_<
<flutter_spin> 4 packs is enough.
<Vivix> Kandarihu: THAT mgiht be true, but yes they are all adults
<TheKoreanBrony1354> I HAVE FLUTTERSHY TO
*CiderIsForDrinking has no merch :'(
<Kandarihu> Perhaps the only pony who's 21 is Granny Smith.
<Silverscreen> 1,11I has a Twilight and Pinkie Pie toy. That's about it.
<prince-dari> Silverscreen, oh dear, here we go
<Rex_Mundi> After translating some 2ch threads about MLP, ive come to the conclusion that applejack is the most popular pony in Japan. I guess she has to be the most popular somewhere...
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Polydunami: God, I feel young :'(
<Derpy_Hooves> Nittany_Discord: permission to drop the dash drives link? :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Silverscreen: There's also a brony group at Penn State I was a part of. They're trying to become an official group.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> MAKE ME SANDWHICH
<Canadian_Brony> I can't find any local Pony merch.
<Vivix> Kandarihu: but that would make the CMC age super fast, a horse matures in 2 years

<Vivix> I felt old when I was 17, now I'm 23 and I feel yougn again
<Spell-of-Gaming> Love and Tolerate was started as a joke, but now it's really a serious thing which it's kinda good for the fandom, probably...
<TheKoreanBrony1354> alegr0 and gigabits talk in 3rd person
<MASF123> I'm 21 and I feel like a lonely depressed suicial old person.

<Vivix> I want to read Past Sins
<pwny> Is it possible to sneeze while taking a piss?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Past Sins is the longest MLP fanfic I finished.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I'm goign to start reading The Divine Comedy.
<Yahooz> Past Sins is like, a requirement for fanfic readers...
<mitamaking> My arms, typing fan fic
<linsett> Go all Fluttershy on us!
<Silverscreen> 1,11I see Love and Tolerate as a general guideline for a brony's morals. If it's something you enjoy, love it all the way. If it's something you don't like, just tolerate it rather than turning into an asshole. That said, you can't let yourself become a push over or a doormat. If you have to fight back, you f**king fight back.
<Ryunosuke> LOVE AND PEACE!
<pony_9790> My brother, unintentionally, got me to watch MLP lol
<prince-dari> Love and tolerate should be an instaban
<Vivix> What is the tags on past sins? I never found it
<prince-dari> :P
<Barbetos> Love and Tolerate is just a punch line of the fandom. Don't put stock into it.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> alegr0 forgive and forget
<pony_9790> Yeah.... :S
<superretroworld> Allegr0: GigabitHarmonie eeyup
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Dang, I use LAT all the time
<Dr_Fumbles> What does god need with a spaceship?
<mitamaking> Love and Tolerate is a type of troll
<Jaketehsnake> Who is speakin? I just joined stream... XD
<Vivix> I use it too, but I used it before the show
<Spell-of-Gaming> Love and Tolerate USED to be a joke.
<MASF123> Love and Tolerate? Your kidding rite?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Jaketehsnake: GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0
<Jaketehsnake> It used to be a tactic to piss off trolls on /b/
<Kandarihu> It seems to me that Love and Tolerance is some sort of ego inflation to the fandom.
<CriticKitten> A jerkdick?
<Bronyhawk> rofl, jerkdick
<CriticKitten> Or a dickjerk?
<Silverscreen> 1,11shitty dicktits? What?
<linsett> Dicktits, wooohoo
<Spell-of-Gaming> But it's being taken as a serious thing.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Jesus.
<VenHur> Love is to worship, Tolerance is to unleash your inner rage, at least that what I thinks of Love and Tolerance...
<MASF123> No one follows it anyway
<Vivix> Kandarihu: It is, for those who don't at least try to do it, you shouldn't try just because of the show though
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<ponies_8989> jerkdick! lol

<Kawaii_icybeauti> he she me WUMBO
<Dken2021> allo SaxyPretender
<Jaketehsnake> The oribinal /b/ronies used love and tolerate as a tool to piss off trolls, not as an actual behavioral change. It was the new bronies that took it and ran.
<twilight_sprinkle> love and tolerate should be a real thing, at least to some degree. people who are too cool for it annoy me
<Silverscreen> 1,11Silverscreen cannot speak in third person unless he is in the middle of an RP. Becuase it's f**king hard to do.

<Colt_45> Allegr0: and company, which pony would you rather ride into battle? Twilight Sparkle, Princess Luna, Princess Celestia, Despair or Ruin?

<Jaketehsnake> Gigabot, If you were a cannibal, what side dish would be appropriate for your meal?
<MASF123> Screw Love and Tolerate I had bronies a plenty who were real dicks to me.

<VenHur> Just kidding.

<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie if you are robots, why can you laugh?
<VenHur> Silverscreen: At The FUCKING Gala!
<CriticKitten> Hrm.
<Buytoast> That's ridiculous
<superretroworld> damn, forgot to put 'like' in the last question

<Vivix> Oh Buytoast that is a good one
<CriticKitten> I think I'm gonna say Love Is In Bloom.
<linsett> Fluttershy's on your podcast. Impersonate her. Go.
<VenHur> Silverscreen: Oh and This Day Aria...
<Dken2021> who's the third person in the BG?
<Yahooz> Ahhhhhh, its me, Bane!
<TheKoreanBrony1354> alegrobot what is the stupidest movie you have evr seen
<Jaketehsnake> GigabitHarmonie Allegr0 Call of Duty or Battlefield?
<Buytoast> Shit son that song gets me everytime wehn they start chanting cider
<Ryunosuke> SEA PONIES!
<Polydunami> I didn't mean the characters, I meant the actors :P
<Ryunosuke> oh
<pony_9790> I like Winter Wrap Up and Smile Smile Smile
<Slenderman> MINE IS BEHIND YOU BY KYOGA :D
<Barbetos> No Winter wrap up love!?
<TheKoreanBrony1354> so many wonders
<Barbetos> WUT!?
<Vivix> Smile smile smile! How could I forget!?
<mitamaking> Art of the Dress
<CriticKitten> This Day Aria is solid, but the more I've heard it, the more it starts to bug me structurally. Love Is In Bloom is a song I can listen to continuously and never get tired of.
<CiderIsForDrinking> Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: What are your opinions on the obscene Lyra plushie?
<Ryunosuke> oh mai
<superretroworld> smile song, duh
<TheKoreanBrony1354> alegrobot tom hardy

<Barbetos> HOW!?
<thrackerzod> OOOHHH MYYYYY
<Derpy123> is the stream working for anyone?

<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: LOL at the last one:D
<XylemTube> OHHH MYYYYYYYY
<Silverscreen> 1,11My least favorite Mane 6 member? That's a tough one. It's a toss up between Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Applejack's personality is too flat and she needs more screen time. I don't like Rainbow Dash because she reminds me too much of the jackass jocks that I had in my school, even if she does have a hidden heart. :/
<TheKoreanBrony1354> alegr0bot do you agree with lyra and bon bon fic
<Ryunosuke> I admit, MLP: FIM has alot of good music
<Canadian_Brony> Buytoast I'm putting this straight to you. A sex toy made as a troll joke
<Barbetos> Gigabit Oooh my bad.
<mitamaking> Only BBBFF song has grown on me, oh wait, CMC song
<VenHur> Oops, I forgot Smile Smile Smile, it's a consolation favorite.

<Derpy123> RD is overated
<Jaketehsnake> Phase4, What game?
<CriticKitten> Love Is In Bloom is the best one honestly. >_> This Day Aria has slipped back on my list to third, behind Smile Smile Smile.

<Phase4> 00,02nyx.ariscop.net

<TheKoreanBrony1354> noooo
<Silverscreen> 1,11On the other hoof, I really LIKE applejack's character because she's so down-to-earth...
<pony_9790> Think of a question
<Canadian_Brony> Silverscreen no pun intended?
<pony_9790> What?
<Reikim> But that's what makes Applejack harder to explore.
<pwny> Could you sing smile smile smile in nigel thornberry's voice?
<Vivix> What?
<Silverscreen> 1,11No pun intended. XD
<TheKoreanBrony1354> +Phase4 did you add me

<AJIsAwesome> Silverscreen: YEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!
<TheKoreanBrony1354> new lays potato chip
<linsett> Fluttershy's on your podcast. Impersonate her. Go.
<Reikim> Applejack's a great character, no doubt about that. But she's too stable to be explored effectively.
<mitamaking> Silverscreen: yes it was
<Phase4> 00,02TheKoreanBrony1354, dont think so, whats your steam name again?

<Yahooz> Baaaaaaaaaaaaane

<VenHur> GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0: Aside for her work as Twilight Sparkle, what is your other favorite Tara Strong works?
<mitamaking> Worst mane 6 pony?
<pony_9790> There. That's the question!
<Unnr> pony_9790: The question is: Given a kerbal of mass m, how fast must he be going to maintain a stable orbit once the rocket he is in explodes at 160,000 km
<MASF123> Stream problems
<Colt_45> Allegr0: Which pony would you rather ride into battle? Luna, Celesta, Twilight, Despair or Ruin?
<Silverscreen> 1,11I LOVED the songs in The Canterlot Wedding, and aside from Smile, they are the best songs of the season. But PERSONALLY, my favorite songs are both of Rarity's (becoming popular and Art of the Dress)
<Cypresswolf> is there such a thing as a worst mane 6?
<pony_9790> I really need to change my name :S
<Canadian_Brony> Cypresswolf no
<Reikim> No, Cypress, there isn't.
<Meanwhile> Well that can't end well.

<TheKoreanBrony1354> MUFFINS
<pony_9790> Okay. I'll change my name right now
<Cypresswolf> I thought so :)

*Ninjazz|Sleep shares the same opinion as Silverscreen.
<Barbetos> He left
<Yahooz> or not
<AJIsAwesome> I actually want Applejack. She is the LEAST developed character in MLP.
<Yahooz> Dude
<Barbetos> now he is back
<Yahooz> AppleJack development
<Silverscreen> 1,11I want Scootaloo to have more development. She is nothing but a young Rainbow Dash right now.

<Vivix> AJ needs dev, though
<Panda> Silverscreen sonic orange boom O_o
<Meanwhile> DWR with voice. For reasons unknown.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> fluttershy the best

<wowviewer> It's kind of weird. I like hiding my nick lol
<Yahooz> Soarin development?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14DWR works with art department

<wowviewer> I would like to see more of RD
<mitamaking> Raibow Dash is so lame
<Meanwhile> Makes sense.
<Silverscreen> 1,11I still say Sweetie Belle is the best CMC because she's more developed.
<AJIsAwesome> wowviewer: That was a GREAT question. Thanks for asking that!:)
<Reikim> We actually have departments now?
<wowviewer> I was here since Fluttershy Hurricane (I think), but never changed the name lol
<mitamaking> Silverscreen: I agree, what happened to Applebloom
<VenHur> Silverscreen: Ikr? And also Scootaloo is the only one of the Cutie Mark Crusaders that doesn't belonged to any relatives, What is she, an orphan? I DEMMAND ANSWERS!
<MASF123> i would like to see less of RD
<Canadian_Brony> mitamaking who is Raibow Dash?
<Reikim> And here I thought those were just names.
<Vivix> I always prefered Sweetie because of her voice and acting, but- yeah
<wowviewer> Heh, no problem :)
<DashWithRainbows> had them for a while.
<twilight_sprinkle> Sweetie Bell is best CMC cause voice cracks iz adorable

<MASF123> mitamaking she gets average screentime
<Meanwhile> More MvM anyone? one of Phases other servers.
<Yahooz> theyve been going well
<Reikim> I'm still on nyx
<flutter_spin> har
<Silverscreen> 1,11The only development from her was the Family Appreciation Day, and even that was more development for Granny Smith than for Applebloom.
<wowviewer> Actually, she can do some things in the future. Remember in that one episode in the talent show, she fixed the tree house by herself
<Vivix> I would like to see more Twilight and Celestia information
<Meanwhile> I assumed Nyx lost too many folks to continue.
<Barbetos> Been a while
<mitamaking> MASF123: I don't know, Baby Cakes, Mmmystery, Friend in Deed
<Yahooz> BronyCon department anyone?
<Reikim> We've got four on Nyx
<Yahooz> :3
<Barbetos> PIE HOLE
<thrackerzod> did her do my question
<thrackerzod> ?
<Reikim> We're running many many engies and one money-grabber scout.
<MASF123> Twilight is shown too much
<thrackerzod> he*
<Dken2021> oh it'a Allegr0 fiance I'm hearing?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that totally wasn't a temporary thing, Yahooz
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>_>
<Ponies47> Hello everypony :P
<wowviewer> There are signs, but there can be a side story for a much more deeper character development
<Dken2021> allo Ponies47
<Silverscreen> 1,11We don't need anymore Pinkie Pie episodes, and we've had enough Rarity episodes.
<sub06905> ello Ponies47
<Yahooz> SaxyPretender: i know~
<Canadian_Brony> hi Ponies47
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Hi!
<VenHur> I would like to see more Applejack episodes in Season 3, she is the only Mane 6 pony thats doesnt has her own song.
<superretroworld> hey Ponies47
<linsett> Could you guys please reply to the email I sent you two weeks ago, since I missed last week's show?
<mitamaking> We have had 2 true Rarity episodes
<Silverscreen> 1,11VenHur: YES!
<Barbetos> What was the name?
<Reikim> Want to join up, Meanwhile?
<Canadian_Brony> VenHur absolutely
<Yahooz> and i was there~
<Meanwhile> Val Vordox and I are currently on...whatever this one is. Idk if Vordox is actually paying attention though.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<mitamaking> Wait, 3
<wowviewer> Pinkie Pie, I think we all know about her and we love it! Rarity, I wouldn't mind seeing more episodes
<flutter_spin> lol
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: Not only that, but she has the least character development.
<Silverscreen> 1,11I want an Applejack Song! I have a feeling she'd sweep us away with a cute slow-country song.
<thrackerzod> :D
<Yahooz> so maybe...
<superretroworld> VenHur: whats rd's song again?
<Yahooz> voice4meh?
<Ninjazz|Sleep> I agree with VenHur. AJ needs actual amount of content.
<Vivix> I do want 2 pinkie and 2 Rarity episodes, but there's onl 13 this time
<Yahooz> maybeh?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14=P
<Yahooz> maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybeh?
<Reikim> Coming over, Meanwhile
<Vivix> AJ has an Amazing voice too, in Winter Wrap up at least
<mitamaking> Vivix: That is not confirmed yet
<Dken2021> superretroworld had a duet with fluttershy
<AJIsAwesome> I hope that if we get an Applejack song, it will have acoustic guitar.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Ninjazz|Sleep
<MASF123> Rarity and Applejack need more screentime
<Yahooz> ...nah im not doing that
<Meanwhile> Looking into it, hang around a mo.
<Vivix> mitamaking: I thought it was confirmed by Wil Anderson?
<Ninjazz|Sleep> Ohey, Canadian_Brony.
<VenHur> And you know what? All of that of what I said makes Applejack my favorite pony, WHY YOU NO GIVE APPLEJACK A SONG?
<Canadian_Brony> . . .
<flutter_spin> heh
<Canadian_Brony> dat email
<mitamaking> Vivix: I thought it was still a rumor
<superretroworld> Dken2021: well not really her solo
<Unnr> Scootaloo episode, I tells ya
<Unnr> its just not fair to scoots
<Silverscreen> 1,11Rarity has had 3 whole episodes to develope her personality. As much as I like her, I think she's had enough screen time.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Cowboy hat > fedora
<Vivix> mitamaking: I don't think it is anymore, but he also said there's a reason, and that s4 is coming
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and I'll fight anyone who disagrees
<Colt_45> OHDEARGOD STOP!!
<Derpy_Hooves> . -.;
<wowviewer> O_O
<mitamaking> Silverscreen: 3 is a lot? Oh come on that is the same as AJ
<thrackerzod> OOHHH MMMYYY
<Kencolt> Fedora. A FEDORA. Why not a fez? Fezzes are cool. I have that on good authority.
<MASF123> Applejack needsa sterotypical county song
<wowviewer> Errr.... Well. Okay then :S
<AJIsAwesome> I agree.
<Yahooz> SaxyPretender: Top hat & monacle > Cow boy hat
<flutter_spin> lol
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: I WILL FIGHT FOR THE FEDORA
<Dken2021> Applejack has the most screentime than anypony, she's been in episodes that don't even concern her
<Canadian_Brony> Kencolt because Fedoras are awesome
<wowviewer> Wait what?
<superretroworld> twilight and fluttershy has had enough
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Evening Ponies
<Vivix> AJ is in a lot, but she doesn't DO a lot, you know?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh deary
<Polydunami> I feel like there are a lot of Mary Sue situations being made for this question :P
<mitamaking> Dken2021: Not counting Twillight you mean
<SaxyPretender> 0,14okay, I might give you that, Yahooz
<Silverscreen> 1,11mitamaking: But those three revealed deep and complex character traits for her character, where as others are just them learning a basic lesson and that's it.
<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 don't ever say anything in that voice ever again.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, YOU WILL LOSE REIKIM
<MASF123> Whatever, fuck this dicussion.
<Yahooz> myeeees see
<mitamaking> I don't email
<Vivix> Of course I want more episodes focusing on all of the M6 as seasons progress, but AJ really needs an episode-
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: THE FEDORA SHALL KICK YOUR ASS
<AJIsAwesome> Dken2021: Screen time, yes, but not character development. She doesn't really DO anything.
<Yahooz> maybe you need to plug your emails again
<LunarSS> a lot of people look stupid in fedora's
<wowviewer> Well... you do have a point Silverscreen
<Dken2021> mitamaking well that was true in season 1 since she was the one to come up with the letters
<Vivix> AJ and SHY being at home, not adventuring
<SaxyPretender> 0,14THE FEDORA WILL LOSE
<mitamaking> AJ just needs one episode, and a FREAKING song
<Barbetos> Oh. I forgot I did that
<superretroworld> where do you send a message, private messages on bs?
<Yahooz> Fedora is mid teir
<VenHur> GigabitHarmonie and Allegr0: Did you also agree that Applejack needs more screen time and her own song (not counting her part in At The Gala) in Season 3?
<Reikim> THE FEDORA WILL BRUTALIZE THE COWBOY HAT
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Yeah. Derpy stole the Last Roundup.
<Reikim> MOBS EVERYWHERE WILL GATHER BEHIND IT
<Derpy_Hooves> SaxyPretender: DO NOT QUESTION THE FEDORA >:I
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> constipation?
<Ninjazz|Away> SaxyPretender, the Fedora will seduce the Cowboy Hat and they'll make children.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I WILL QUESTION IT
<SaxyPretender> 0,14BECAUSE COWB-
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: yeah- but that was a good AJ episode-

<Canadian_Brony> thrackerzod who the buck knows
<Silverscreen> 1,11Applejack needs a family-focused episode that reveals how she sees the mane 6 as an extended family, and while she's deeply rooted to her family and traditional ways, she learns that going outside of tradition isn't always a bad thing. A semi-sad song would be included.
<Canadian_Brony> is he takin' a shit?
<CrimsonPhoenix> So I played the intro and a complete chapter of Dust
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Barbetos: Did you die of diabeetus?

<VenHur> Silverscreen: Agreed, they need to further expands the relationship between Applejack and Big Mac.

<Franek12354> Now the K.O Answer.....
<Cypresswolf> If I were to spend only 1 day in Equestria...I'd seek out Twilight Sparkle to cast a spell where I relive that same day over and over (Groundhogs Day style) and visit everypony until I get bored
<Reikim> Saxy's cowboy hats can't even compare.
<CiderIsForDrinking> They should just keep making that noise until they leave

<Kandarihu> prince-dari, parents who trust their children to take care of themselves
<linsett> IT'S HUGGGEEEE
<Silverscreen> 1,11VenHur: that's what I mean by family-centric. AJ's and Mac's relationship isn't very well explained, and right now we see AJ as more of a mother figure to Applebloom rather than a sister.
<Reikim> I dissed it.
<pwny> eeeyup
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hey

<Silverscreen> 1,11...
<flutter_spin> nice little theory
<Yahooz> GUYS
<Yahooz> ENOUGH
<Reikim> Just because I think that a fedora and a waistcoat is just better
<Yahooz> THIS IS BEST HAT http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Spongebob_2e3c24_3034520.png
<Reikim> Because CLASS.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm a science nerd, and I'm very lost

<flutter_spin> nice
<Franek12354> :D
<Canadian_Brony> Franek12354 eeyup
<VenHur> Silverscreen: I would make Applejack my favorite pony of the series if all of that is acomplished in an episode, hoofs down.
<Franek12354> :D
<DerpyMuffins> I need a new brain
<Silverscreen> 1,11I would love to have Big Mac suddenly spew off all that science mumbo jumbo and leave Twilight with a hanging mout. XD

<flutter_spin> Pinkie Dying Pie?
<Silverscreen> 1,11mouth*
<Unnr> It would be nice to see the actual story behind where AJ´s parents are
<linsett> flutter_spin LOL
<Prince_Blueblood> have you guys watched that epic rap battles of equestria video with big mac vs blueblood?
<Yahooz> Tiiiiime
<Reikim> I like how Saxy's method of checking if people are OK involves hurting them.
<Canadian_Brony> Silverscreen . . . I would love to see that in the show!
<superretroworld> top favourite are pinkie, applejack and fluttershy
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I know what I'd do if I had one day in Equestria, I'd do all the stuff I'd want to do then in the last seconds kiss Big Mac before I vanish
<flutter_spin> villagers. I like that. Never thought of them that way.
<Yahooz> well...
<pwny> Visit Molestia
<Polydunami> What about Fluttershy's and Rainbow Dash's parents?
<Yahooz> no
<superretroworld> Unnr: eeyup
<flutter_spin> 2nd target?
<VenHur> Silverscreen: Hahah! Yeah, way out of character, but hillarity issues! Hahahaaaah!
<Dken2021> If I go to equestria, I would invite the dragons over for a second chance
<Silverscreen> 1,11Like, Big Mac is actually well learned in the Family Psychology and give Twilight a bit of a lesson on why Applejack is being such a pain.
<Franek12354> I did not through you will read this all.....
<Yahooz> you obviously dont know bout Terry Bogart

<Silverscreen> 1,11linsett: I don't think they should make MLP any darker than how Canterlot Wedding got.
<VenHur> linsett: Well they made it darker with the setting of "A Canterlot Wedding", WE NEED TO GO DEEPER THAN THAT!
<Prince_Blueblood> I don't want a darker episode than they had with season 2 final
<Vivix> I'd prefer if they stick to their demographic instead of catering to us all the time
<Canadian_Brony> wtf was that!
<flutter_spin> LOL
<mitamaking> This person thought this out
<Barbetos> Big Mac will now be played by Hank Hill GigabitHarmonie =P
*Reikim refuses to think about S3
*Canadian_Brony goes back to sleep
<Prince_Blueblood> one of the reasons I like this series is the escapism
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> not to mention the forst 2 episodes of the 2nd season was pretty dark
<linsett> Alright then.
<Franek12354> OMG its finishing...
<Prince_Blueblood> if I wanted darker I'd watch regular TV
<superretroworld> Silverscreen: a dog an pony show was pretty dark
<Silverscreen> 1,11bringing darkness to a world of light is one thing. To turn the official material into another world of GrimDark would turn it to crap.

<flutter_spin> lol, that Octavia correction
<Canadian_Brony> Silverscreen e-mails sent by Bronystate
<Kencolt> I think that I should go to the Royal Canterlot Library (if permitted) or the Ponyville Library (if not) and research the actual known history of Equestria, it's more notable historical characters, and most of all the relationship between a Amniomorphic Array and Arcanopathic Flows, in relation to Thaumaparticular transference.

<Franek12354> This explaines everything..
<Polydunami> You kidding?
<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 GigabitHarmonie a background pony is one with a model that is used for large crowds and is often repeated. IE, you can see Lyra 4 times in "Boast Busters"
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM PONY TRIVIA: Bonbon's changing voice has lead to a fanon on how Bon Bon IS a voice actress and her cutie mark are throat soothing candies.

<otakon> night TheKoreanBrony1354
<Silverscreen> 1,11bleh. Don't like those kind of games. They bore me.
<flutter_spin> So its DOTA, if you were directly controlling the main guy
<Canadian_Brony> you place Towers which attack the enemy who enters in rounds and attempts to go from Point A to Point B. The towers can be upgraded and the enemies have health. If a certain amount of enemies reaches Point B, you lose.
<Canadian_Brony> THAT is a Tower Defense
<Canadian_Brony> in a nutshell

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I know the answer but i dont want the game
<Prince_Blueblood> <@Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some ISPs don't use download caps. <- mine is only 200 GB a week
<Kandarihu> Comcast has a download cap, but it's really hard to hit.
<Jmo4267> LOL
<flutter_spin> whoa whoa double blue
<Prince_Blueblood> pfft, was just a quote
<Canadian_Brony> Moons of Jupiter include: Metis, Adastrea, Amalthea, Thebe, Io, Europa, Callisto, Ganymede, Leda, Himalia, Lysithea, and about 50 more
<MirrorImage> was still colors

<Prince_Blueblood> can't quote mods without getting kicked
<otakon> so
<wowviewer> It's ***********

<Derpy_Hooves> Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie: STOP YOU VIOLATED THE LAW
<Barbetos> Bronystate guards are going to be breaking in your doors soon.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01200 GB / week isn't that bad.

<Prince_Blueblood> na, I'm happy with it
<linsett> Awww, it was nice watching you guys agian.
<Barbetos> They will yell "Stop you criminal scum!"
<Kencolt> I'm on Xfinity. WHich is run by Comcast. What's the DL cap?
<flutter_spin> nono Prince_Blueblood , I didn't know you could do that. It confused me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think Comcast had 300 GB / month.
<Prince_Blueblood> wish I could do port forwarding here
<Prince_Blueblood> but I'll live with it
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> youre sick?
<Bronyhawk> Allegr0, <3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Which is more strict.

<linsett> *again
<twilight_sprinkle> time warner cable has unlimited download cap

<LunarSS> i think your voice is sexy Allegr0
<Barbetos> Allegr0 why u sad? You obviously have the brains.
<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 Y U sad? Did I misss something? Watch Whose Line! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXT6foyWZCw

<Meanwhile> Her character grinds my gears, she is the very epitome of what I despise and I would run over my own legs with a steamroller if I thought it'd make her stop existing.
<Phase4> thats what fandoms do though,
<Canadian_Brony> right Ponies47?

<CiderIsForDrinking> Everyone, you wake up to Discord on one side of you and Chrysalis(fail spelling?) on the other. Who do you turn to face?
<Barbetos> Nice to meet you too
<cachi01|mobile> Fluttershy777 pls i drink 2 gatorades almost everynight
<Phase4> Reikim, point is your writing it
<Reikim> Well, I'm writing it off my own ideas, based loosely on a terrible idea given me by a friend on FanFic who can't write
<MALK> You in a brony group Barbetos?
<Reikim> \
<Reikim> Well, I'm going to do it well.
<MirrorImage> CiderIsForDrinking - Pinkie Pie, at the foot of the bed, obviously
<Barbetos> MALK Bronystate I suppose?
<Reikim> The problem is that the fandom sees things in Trixie that aren't there to begin with.
<Phase4> good, its hard to find a good trixie fic
<Polydunami> I'd hug Celestia who is on top of me, CiderIsForDrinking :3
<MALK> Barbetos like a local one where you meetup?
<Reikim> I'm rewriting it for the second time.
<Phase4> i've not found one that isnt trixie/twi shipping
<CiderIsForDrinking> :D
<Reikim> Argh
<Meanwhile> Raggle fraggle.
<Reikim> That ship pisses me off SO MUCH
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 what type do you want ? redemption shipping or sad ending ?
<cachi01|mobile> Pinkie pie is watching you sleep
<Reikim> Anyway
<Reikim> ANYWAY
<ponies_8989> :D
<Colt_45> kiling me wont bring your honey BACK!!!!
<Meanwhile> No no no, no "anyway"
<Meanwhile> Why?
<Reikim> I wrote six chapters and now I'm starting from scratch.
<Phase4> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, the interesting kind
<Polydunami> NOT THE BEES
<cachi01|mobile> Yes it will
<Fluttershy777> cachi01|mobile I drink like 5 every day. :P
<sub06905> wouldnt mind pinkie watching me sleep
<Colt_45> is stream dead again?
<Phase4> Reikim, why?
<Reikim> Okay
<Barbetos> MALK not really.
<Canadian_Brony> stupid internet
<Reikim> Let's see if I can explain this.
<sonicandmario85> no ones streaming
<MirrorImage> speaking of Pinkie Pie... whatever happened to that Ace Attorney / MLP video series from months back?
<Cypresswolf> :) Wait til after Return of the King tomorrow night - I have the perfect video to share with all of you :)
<cachi01|mobile> Fluttershy777 THEY R BUCKING DELICIOUS
<ponies_8989> dum internet
<Reikim> The original idea starts with Trixie having a son.
<MALK> Barbetos look at this map http://www.bronies.com/img/old-map-NORTH_AMERICA.png
<Phase4> o_O
<Reikim> A bastard with some noble.
<cachi01|mobile> MirrorImage episode 4 is being made
<Reikim> (this isn't my bloody idea, by the way)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 objective does not compute
<Fluttershy777> cachi01|mobile Yes they are. :)
<superretroworld> Cypresswolf: and you will know my name is the lord, when i lay my vengeance apon thee
<Polydunami> You mean Turnabout Storm? It's taking a while for the next episode
<cachi01|mobile> But its taking its time :(
<Meanwhile> Phase4.exe has stopped working.
<Polydunami> And it's actually Episode 3: Twilight.
<MirrorImage> cachi01|mobile - i assumed as much, but it's been... 2 months? or more
<Reikim> And then said noble's father wants to sacrifice him to turn himself into a god.
<otakon> it's a fan project
<MALK> TOONAMI IS ON
<otakon> what do you expcet?
<Canadian_Brony> Turnabout Storm - Episode 4 will release after Episdoe 3 - Twilight
<otakon> MALK: yay!
<Cypresswolf> superretroworld: Fuck Yes!
<Phase4> what
<Phase4> the
<Phase4> apples
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> meh you lost me
<Reikim> This god form would be called his "Cosmos Alicorn" form
<cachi01|mobile> I thought they cancelled episode 3 twilight
<Reikim> By the way
<MirrorImage> eh... too much obviously
<twilight_sprinkle> btw i gots mlp osters, yay
<Reikim> Yes it's cheesy and I hate it
<Allegr0> alright, time for this pony to rest up. Thanks for tuning in and I'll see you guys later!
<twilight_sprinkle> *posters
<MirrorImage> it more or less went dark as far as i knew
<Reikim> The guy giving it to me is an idiot.
<Polydunami> No, just the game
<twilight_sprinkle> bai Allegr0
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> you got me with son and you lost me with god
<Meanwhile> Evidently.
<Dken2021> seeya Allegr0
<Polydunami> ... Wait, I mean the sequel to Turnabout Storm
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> bye Allegr0
<Reikim> Also the mane6 get involved at some point.
<cachi01|mobile> Cya allegr0
<Reikim> At the beginning.
<sonicandmario85> BAI ALLEGR0
<Fluttershy777> Goodnight Allegr0.
<MirrorImage> so going through my cable channels...
<Phase4> Reikim, ok... you cant really sell the god bit
<Meanwhile> Before I rekindle my murderous rage at people I don't know,
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Allegr0
<MirrorImage> Johnny Bravo is on Boomerang
<Reikim> I won't explain all of it because it's full of plotholes and stupid.
<Polydunami> Thank you, Allegr0, for the entertainment
<Phase4> but you could make everything else interesting
<Reikim> Sec
<MALK> SAMURAI 7 on TOONAMI
<Reikim> I'm getting to that bit
<Polydunami> And insights :3
<OneTrickPony> night Allegr0
<Meanwhile> What've you got against Twixie shipping?
<MirrorImage> don't even know what Samurai 7 is...
<cachi01|mobile> A GOOD SHOW BEING BROADCASTED IN BOOMERANG?
<Polydunami> SAMURAI SEVEN!?
<Reikim> Also he wanted to give Trixie a massive and meaningless power boost.
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: do you have the comic con 2011 group?
*MirrorImage blindly hits go to Cartoon Network
<cachi01|mobile> WHAT IS THIS SPARTA
<Reikim> I'll get to Meanwhile's point in a bit.
<Reikim> Now
<Dken2021> that a good show?
<MALK> ITS A NEW ANIME ON TOONAMI
<Reikim> I decided there were some redeeming factors, so I start writing it.
<Polydunami> Oh, I thought it was the actual movie
<sonicandmario85> cachi01|mobile:they show some old show son boomerang..
<MALK> NO Im just going to watch TOONAMI
<Reikim> New direction, giving Trixie and her son more personality, exploring Trixie's reasons for her arrogance, etc.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 i like this one http://www.fimfiction.net/story/3846/Festival
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: hmm, idk tbh, i left them at my apartment without getting a proper look yet. its the 4 free posters at walmart
<Cypresswolf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhsCp5HgxSk Twilightliscious
<Dken2021> aww, if only I had cable ;_;
<Polydunami> They show classic live action shows on a channel called MeTV where I live
<Reikim> Six chapters in, just recently, I decided I don't like it anymore.
<VenHur> Well, gtg guys, getting late...
<Reikim> It's not what I want.
<Reikim> So I'm revising again.
<MirrorImage> today on Samurai 7 - rice collecting montage
<cachi01|mobile> sonicandmario85 just for 1 hour and then its a channel for teenage justin bieber fan girls
<MALK> Bye VenHur
<Reikim> My end goal is to tell a story from two fronts.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but it incomplete and last chapter got a bad twist by bringin discord
<Fluttershy777> Dafuq
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: i didnt know they had them at wal mart, thats awsome
<OneTrickPony> Dken2021: you dont need cable if you have the internet
<Polydunami> We've got Hawaii Five-O and Cannon
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> or i'm getting mixed with other fic
<Polydunami> The CLASSIC Five-O, mind you
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: theyre supposed to, but i had to go to three walmarts until i found one that had them
<Reikim> The first is to tell the story of Trixie's son (Luxor) as he enters into the real world and becomes acquainted with the realities of Life, all while coming of age. He's been hospitalized his whole life, by the way.
<Reikim> The other half of the story is Trixie's end.
<superretroworld> oh
<Reikim> She has to relearn how to distinguish between illusion and reality.
<Reikim> Specifically, her own self-illusions.
<cachi01|mobile> Slenderman slenderman. Does whatever a slender can
<Fluttershy777> We should play Family Feud!
<Polydunami> Oh, and we have Bonanza and Gunsmoke
<Reikim> So I'll get to explore the relationship of illusion and reality quite deeply, which will be satisfactory.
<Reikim> *satisfying
<Phase4> hmmm
<Cypresswolf> :) Don't forget to brush your teeth! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtGyequDXDo
<sonicandmario85> Spider slender man Spider Slender man does whatever a spider slender man does
<Reikim> Her character arc will culminate in discovering what her cutie mark actually means
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 also look for The balad of twlight sparkle, Adored and 	Teardrops and Snowflakes
<Reikim> It is illusion.
<Polydunami> 100 people were asked this question: Who is best pony?
<cachi01|mobile> So anypony here has played super robotnik land?
<Reikim> Trixie becomes mistress of illusion.
<sonicandmario85> no
<cachi01|mobile> Do it
<Reikim> This is her role as a stage magician.
<cachi01|mobile> Its hilarious
<cachi01|mobile> Polydunami PINKIE PIEEEEEE
<Shizuka> 13any ponies for mvm?
<Phase4> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, think i've read the first one
<sonicandmario85> i can tell its a sonic game about robotnik/eggman LOL by the name
<Fluttershy777> Polydunami Fluttershy
<Meanwhile> Why must you ask at 6 in the morning...
<Shizuka> 13any ponies who don't need to sleep~
<Meanwhile> Ah, bugger it I didn't want to sleep anyway.
<Polydunami> Now now, it's one answer at a time :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> eh i'll join
<Reikim> And then there are bits like how all reality is percieved, and if Trixie is to be the illusionist than she must be aware of the reality, and that Trixie is the only one able to see the truth
<Reikim> Stuff liek that
<Reikim> *like
<Polydunami> Pinkie Pie!
<cachi01|mobile> YEEES
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'll join in spirit
<pony_678> >

<Fluttershy777> :P
<pony_678> f
<cachi01|mobile> HELL NAW
<Polydunami> Actually, this counts as RP, doesn't it?
*Reikim takes a deep breath
<Canadian_Brony> what does?
<Canadian_Brony> I was pissing with files
<Reikim> And that kind of somewhat outlines what I'm going to do with this terrible idea.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 also i'm reading Gettin' Back On Her Hooves
<Polydunami> Acting like the host of Family Feud
<sonicandmario85> LOL
<Reikim> If I ever finish, Phase4, I'll let you know.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and Longest Night, Longest Day
<Canadian_Brony> /)_(\
<Reikim> Heck I'll let you betaread.
<Fluttershy777> Canadian_Brony do not be mean to the flys.
<Reikim> I need a beta who isn't incompetent.
<Polydunami> Speaking of which, I must say Rest in Peace, Richard Dawson
<cachi01|mobile> PP > TS > RARITY = AJ > FS > RD
<Canadian_Brony> I was moving files around my computer. F I L E S
<Reikim> Meanwhile can attest to the incometence of the guy who threw me the idea.
<Ponies47> Who pinged me twice before?
<sonicandmario85> fillies*
<Fluttershy777> Oh. DERP.
<Reikim> *incompetence
<Colt_45> stream died -saaadface-
<Meanwhile> Raggle fraggle.
<ponies_8989> oh derp indeed
<Reikim> I have no idea why you keep saying that.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Billy and Mandy reference?
<Meanwhile> It's the sound I make when I'm complaining generically.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim i'll let you know that the llusionist trixie is a cliche right now
<Meanwhile> Like if I bang my hand on the doorframe.
<ponies_8989> Colt_45 don't cry
<Reikim> What
<Fluttershy777> I feel like such a retard.
<cachi01|mobile> gooby pls
<Dken2021> so.. what to talk about?
<Toxic_Mysticaura> Hey Everypony
<Reikim> And here I thought I came up with a way to save the idea.
<Reikim> Well, it makes sense.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Toxic_Mysticaura
<Dken2021> allo Toxic_Mysticaura
<Polydunami> Ponies47, when the chat derps, the scroll function locks up; the sound you hear is actually every new message being typed off screen.
<Reikim> I don't know if anyone's explored the idea fully yet, though.
<Meanwhile> Right now? Illusionist Trixie has been cliché since the character appeared.
<Reikim> Or competently.
<Shizuka> 13Refresh your streams ponies
<ponies_8989> Fluttershy777 don't say that to urself man
<Reikim> Mistress of Illusion, thanks much.
<Reikim> I'm taking the idea to another level, I like to think.
<cachi01|mobile> Flattershi don y u fel ritared?
<Dken2021> ah some mvm?
<Fluttershy777> ponies_8989 Why not...
<MirrorImage> ooo, mvm
<Ponies47> Polydunami: Oh O.O

<MASF123> Shizuka is streaming?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14for Meanwhile
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim if you read any fic from the Lunaverse you get trixie is an illusionist student of luna element of magic
<Ponies47> Dat TF2
<Canadian_Brony> I can't! Play! TF2~~
<Canadian_Brony> !!!
<Reikim> Lunaverse?
<Polydunami> It's free though
<Canadian_Brony> Aaarrrgghh!!!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> luna instead of celestia
<Reikim> Well I don't follow that.
<Canadian_Brony> my computer won't run Steam games
<sonicandmario85> his video cards shitty like mine
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and pretty much the elemnts are different
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.384992-BioWare-Defends-DLC-Business-Strategy?page=5#15327836 <- My thoughts exactly.
<sonicandmario85> thats what hes saying
<MASF123> yeah same here
<cachi01|mobile> But good pc aint free
<Polydunami> Oh
<Canadian_Brony> no my video card is fine
<Canadian_Brony> hell, it's damn good
<Dken2021> I would get TF2, but don't want to overburden this laptop anymore
<Reikim> Look, has anyone actually completely explored the relationship between illusion and reality using Trixie as a vehicle?
<Ponies47> I was just playing MvM :P
<Reikim> In most fics, I find, it's all just about powers.
<MASF123> good pc is moneydriven just like anything else in this world
<Polydunami> I need a keyboard that supports rollover before I play TF2
<MASF123> rollover?
<Canadian_Brony> rollover? What does that mean?
<cachi01|mobile> ^
<Reikim> It's not just about giving Trixie powers, because I've seen that, it's stupid, that's what the original idea-creator wanted to do.
<Reikim> It's shallow.
<sonicandmario85> FUCK THATS ALL YOU NEED IS WASD KEYS A MOUSE AND A SPACE BAR
<XAX> caps not required.
<Polydunami> For me it would be the [;'\ keys :P
<Reikim> And that's about all there is to say on the matter.
<MASF123> but how will you switch guns? :O
<Canadian_Brony> and f, r, q, e, z, x, c, and v
<JRP2234> qwerty
<Reikim> Moving on to the older question about Twixie shipping.
<Polydunami> And sometimes Y!
<Canadian_Brony> and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
<cachi01|mobile> And also you need R, 123456789, v, tab
<Canadian_Brony> for Spy, Engie, and weps
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> I'm not even entirely sure on that count.
<cachi01|mobile> And shit tons of other things
<Canadian_Brony> y and u for chatting
<Canadian_Brony> v for mic
<MASF123> Unless it's a farm!
<Reikim> I just don't see Twixie shipping working in a completely sane environment.
<MALK> I'll join you guys if you need a extra player
<sonicandmario85> HOW DO YOU MAKE ANIMATIONS ON DAT
<Canadian_Brony> basically, all you need is the right half of a keyboard and 1-0. (0 for cancelling spy menu)
<Polydunami> I'm more likely to call her Asuka, tbh :S
<Canadian_Brony> sonicandmario85 get an animated pic and put it in
<cachi01|mobile> F is for the f that does f f f f f u is for u and u n is for n n here in th blue sea
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry, my internet completely died.. What happened during the livestream?
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome not much.
<cachi01|mobile> S3 episode
*Canadian_Brony slaps cachi01|mobile
<MASF123> WTF is dat
<cachi01|mobile> Then HL3 reveal trailer
<Polydunami> You missed Newborn Cuties, AJIsAwesome :P
<AJIsAwesome> Anyonw know what Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie were talking about?
<Canadian_Brony> MASF123 Team Fortress 2: Mann vs Machine
<cachi01|mobile> Then news about justin bieber being dead
<AJIsAwesome> I missed the last 10 minutes.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim depends i do know cause twixie is my fav ship :p
<Pinkieshy_appledash_> My user name is odd...
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome of the podcast?
<Reikim> I just don't see it happening.
<XAX> cachi01|mobile: Wut.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Yes.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Pinkieshy_appledash_
<Dken2021> AJIsAwesome didn't really miss much, other than giga and allegr0 leaving
<Reikim> Beyond my general dislike of Mane 6 shipping.
<Reikim> I mean, what impetus is there?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehhh is mostly the rival thing that every anime seems to have
<AJIsAwesome> Did they ask any more questions?
<Dken2021> no
<Reikim> Trixie is not Twilight's rival.
<Reikim> Don't you dare suggest that.
<cachi01|mobile> este burrito esta muy bueno pero le falta salsa verde
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome Allegr0 and GigabitHarmonie said thanks to everypony, then left. After some non-stream, we got TF2: MvM
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> rival antagonist enemy whatever term you like
<Reikim> Twilight herself has dismissed the notion.
<MirrorImage> Canadian_Brony - well... we will eventually
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01|mobile Engrish plz!
<MirrorImage> they've been standing around for about 10 minutes now
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> my english is not good enough to explain myself fully
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks. Aw man. I would've loved to have said goodbye.:'(
<Reikim> Trixie is a hack magician who trades in illusion and deceit.
<Canadian_Brony> I think they're waiting for a 6th player
<Polydunami> What does faltar mean again?
<cachi01|mobile> Maids vs Maid-machines
<MirrorImage> i would've joined them, but the server is password protected
<Reikim> She is also arrogant, deluded, and most importantly, completely devoid of common sense.
<cachi01|mobile> Faltar is uhmmm i forgot lol
<ponies_8989> it means missing
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> so you are going to follow cannon
<cachi01|mobile> ^
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|mobile: That's fantastic!
<MASF123> applejack was the password last time
<Reikim> Twilight, on the other hand, is potentially the most powerful unicorn to ever exist.
<Reikim> Yes, I follow canon.
<Canadian_Brony> MirrorImage ask the mods for the password. They'll let you in.
<Reikim> So no, there is no rivalry.
<Reikim> Oh dammit
<Polydunami> It's been four years since I took Spanish last :S
<Reikim> Now I've unconsciously started drawing up alternate scenarios.
*Ponies47 Can't speak spanish at all
<Reikim> The only way - the ONLY way - I could see it working is as a master-student relationship.
<cachi01|mobile> The next sentance is half life 3 release date
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim been done
<Dken2021> never!
<Canadian_Brony> pfft, Spanish. I got taught French. I barely passed my last year.

<cachi01|mobile> En cuanto la pinche luna deje de girar
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> been done
<Reikim> That is the only scenario I can see working.
<Canadian_Brony> over a year later, I forgot almost everything
<ponies_8989> ha
<Canadian_Brony> Porte is door
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and as i said it's been done
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> :p
<Reikim> Exactly.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14I need to try bear paw some day...
<AJIsAwesome> MASF123: What name?
<Reikim> I'm sorry, I don't have a means of describing the sheer dumbfounded disbelief I feel at the very notion.
<MASF123> Slim Shady
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I ate this chicken stuffed with bacon, cheese, and brocolli. It was wrapped in bacon and drenched in hollondaise sauce :D
<Polydunami> xD
<Ninjazz|Away> ... Trixie... and Rarity?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> want me to link you the lunaverse ones ?
<Buytoast> oh holy shit
<Buytoast> that sounds delicious
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: So jealous......:O
<MirrorImage> SuperBrony64 - and served with utensils made of bacon?
<MASF123> ...fuck I should eat now
<Reikim> I shall have to resort to that time-honored method of conveying my feelings: wat.
<Dken2021> god, now I want some
<SuperBrony64> 11,02It was OK ><
<Reikim> I'll skip the Lunaverse.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MirrorImage: That would have been awesome :D
<Polydunami> I was born before Eminem's rap song, actually; no way would I have been named Slim Shady :P
<Reikim> It's not my cup of tea.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> k
<MASF123> God...I HATE MY LIFE.
<MirrorImage> i know, right?
<MirrorImage> it would make cleaning up after breakfast so much easier!
<AJIsAwesome> MirrorImage: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 I had soup for supper. It was cold and disgusting
<Ninjazz|Away> Trixie... <('__'<) (>;__;)> Rarity...
<MirrorImage> "Alright, who's washing silverware?" "I AM! *nom*"
<Ninjazz|Away> Nope.
<MASF123> I would eat paper if it tasted good.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: I didn't have anything for dinner.
<Polydunami> I'm pretty sure you guys know my real name already :P
<Ponies47> Back
<MASF123> no I don't
<cachi01|mobile> Bacon utensils?
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Nope.avi
<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami I don't.
<cachi01|mobile> Yo dawg i heard you like bacon
<MALK> Polydunami is it AMI?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> oh wtf I just realized Im still here
<MASF123> I herd u liek Mudkips.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> aight to to abandon chat
<Canadian_Brony> I've said my real name a couple times, but only when I was story-telli-HOLY SHIT TANK!!!!
<Polydunami> Ami? I wish it were, so that I could be everypony's "ami" but nope.
<MALK> NO I LIKE DIDOS MASF123 GET YOUR FACTS STRAIT
<cachi01|mobile> Dunami?
<cachi01|mobile> Poly?
<cachi01|mobile> Bob?
<MALK> Ami
<MASF123> Dildos? :S
<Reikim> Precisely.
<MALK> Didos
<Reikim> The entire concept is ludicrous.
<ponies_8989> ellis?
<MASF123> ???
<Canadian_Brony> Stop that tank!!!
<Reikim> And that's beyond my regular hatred for all things shipping.
<Canadian_Brony> Nice
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat Bob ping
<superretroworld> burn the witch
<Canadian_Brony> "Have a bonus"
<Cypresswolf> You mean Dittos
<Ponies47> KA-BOOOOOOOOM!
<Ninjazz|Away> I mean, I'm a fan of almost every Rarity ship, but Trixity just doesn't register.
<MASF123> Oh. Dittos :)
<MALK> NO Cypressworld I mean Dildos
<Ninjazz|Away> You CAN make a good ship out of nothing if you write it right.
<Jmo4267> wat.
<Polydunami> Well people call me David for some reason, I can't figure out why :P
<MASF123> wut
<Ninjazz|Away> But there's just no chemistry at all with Trixie and Rare.
<MALK> Hey David
<Dken2021> butt wiggling...
<cachi01|mobile> Im watching goblet of fire...
<ponies_8989> david
<MASF123> Because you look like David Hasslehoff.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Wiggle wiggle wiggle?
<cachi01|mobile> Dem russians
<Cypresswolf> Doduos?
*Reikim just hates shipping
<Reikim> WEll
<Reikim> I should specifiy.
<Reikim> *specify
<MASF123> Your quite muscluar person
<Polydunami> ... I don't want to look like David Hasselhoff :P
<MirrorImage> did i just hear "Zecora shaking her ass?"
<Reikim> I tend to loathe shipping in the MLP verse in the majority of cases.
<Ninjazz|Away> Like Rainbow Dash style shipping?
<MASF123> Why not? He's gets all the bitches
<Reikim> Liek that.
<Reikim> *Like
<Reikim> Exceptions: Vinyl x Octavia
<Reikim> ^ Favourite ship
<Ninjazz|Away> Ship everypony with everypony just to see it happen.
<cachi01|mobile> theres not gonna be fame
<Canadian_Brony> and suddenly dead
<AJIsAwesome> MirrorImage: I heard that too.........:O
<Reikim> I've done that
<Reikim> It's bloody painful.
<cachi01|mobile> And theres not gonna be bitches
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Most shippings don't make sense.
<Buytoast> I'd like to see someone try the advanced waves of this.
<Polydunami> The thought of "getting all the bitches" scares me to be honest :S
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially Mane 6 shippings.
<Ninjazz|Away> Wb.
<MirrorImage> Buytoast - i did...
<MirrorImage> it failed
<MirrorImage> miserably
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why ship friends?
<Reikim> Yes, Nitt.
<Buytoast> It's brutal beyond decency.
<Reikim> I don't like Mane6 shippings on principle.
<MirrorImage> protip - 6 Engie team is super effective on Normal only...
<MirrorImage> although what i'd love to see is a 3/3 team of engies and heavies
<Canadian_Brony> I wanna play this!
<XylemTube> yay more TF2
<MALK> I'd do it with you Buytoast if you would do it
<MirrorImage> allt he heavies have xaio-long blasters and destroy projectiles
<Ninjazz|Away> I'm only fine with RarityXMane6 ones. >_>;
<MASF123> Wonder why God hasn't killed me yet? :/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wish I had more pyro flamethrowers.
<Reikim> Now, something like Touhou, that's a far better ground for shipping.
<MirrorImage> heavies protect the sentries, sentries destroy everything
<Reikim> MLP? Not really.
<Buytoast> I'd try it, but probably not tonight.
<Canadian_Brony> But my stupid computer refuses to get the game running.
<Polydunami> Rain falls on everypony, guy :$
<Polydunami> I mean the weather
<Reikim> I only support Vinyl x Octavia, and Berry Punch x Colgate because really Ruby Pinch is just too damn cute.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Actually, I only have the base pyro flamethrower.
<MASF123> I have NOTHING
<Canadian_Brony> where's the tank? I thought this was a Tank round?
<XylemTube> Dat phlog
<Polydunami> Wait, there are people who live in the desert. NEVER MIND o_O
<Reikim> I also once shipped Big Mac and Cheerilee, but only briefly, in passing, and out of convenience more than anything else.
<MirrorImage> a surprisingly effective spy tactic is Big Earner + Health on Kill + Dead Ringer
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: Same here :P
<MirrorImage> for mvm
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The only fanon ship that I may be OK with is Lyra x Bon Bon.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The others are friendships.
<Reikim> I like that one too.
<MASF123> Look at the health bar
<MirrorImage> *stab* *stab* *stab* *Dead Ring* *Disguise* *stab* *stab* *stab*
<Canadian_Brony> rackin' up the kills, eh Shizuka?
<Ninjazz|Away> You know, I still don't really understand VinylxOctavia.
<MASF123> Damn
<Reikim> But inside the Mane 6? No, just no.
<XAX> MirrorImage: Knife with Christmas lights.
<Reikim> Vinyl x Octavia started as a joke.
<Reikim> It grew from there.
<cachi01|mobile> Uncharted logic: trapped in desert? Dont worry you can survive after 4 days without water and walking all th time
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd like to practice with Spy on a normal mission.
<MASF123> Black Christmas
<MirrorImage> XAX - yes, but that doesn't recharge your Dead Ringer AND your Hit Points
<MALK> I like didos
<MALK> I LOVE DIDOS
<Ninjazz|Away> But just because they're musical ponies?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: Modded HUD?
<Reikim> The joke is that Octavia is a classy traditional instrumentalist.
<cachi01|mobile> Why did i misread that?
<Reikim> While Vinyl is a hardcore electronic DJ.
<MirrorImage> i don't think Shizuka is actually watching IRC
<Shizuka> 13FrankenHUD
<XAX> MirrorImage: I know, but it's a knife with Christmas lights around it. What's not to like?
<MirrorImage> ...neverind
<Shizuka> 13IRC is on screen two as always
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cachi01|mobile: I about did as well.
<Reikim> Who DOESN'T JUST PLAY DUBSTEP, I am obligated to add.
<Reikim> They are therefore as opposite as you will get.
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka dual monitor /)
<Canadian_Brony> the ONLY way to chat!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was thinking of kicking him too sadly. Sorry MALK.
<Ninjazz|Away> Exactly.
<Reikim> Throw two types like that into a small, confined space, and laughter ensues.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It would have been my bad.
*Ponies47 Wants to do daul monitor when he gets a new computer
<MASF123> ???
<cachi01|mobile> dual monitor fancy
<Reikim> Hollywood has been abusing that for decades.
<Reikim> Shipping them is even more ludicrous, thus it will happen.
<MirrorImage> i can techincally dual monitor right now - my tv has a VGA port that i can use for SD picture
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 it is SO bucking useful!
<Ninjazz|Away> So it's a sitcom ship. o_O
<MALK> Nittany_Discord why would you kick him?
<Reikim> Personally, I'm not too sure on their relationship; they might be best buds, but they might also be getting some tension beyond that.
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: I should. When I get a new computer :3
<Reikim> Yes.
<XAX> Canadian_Brony: I got my old CRT monitor that came with my old computer I got in 2004 and hooked it up to my graphics card. Dual monitors are indeed sick.
<Reikim> Yes it is.
<LoGaN> hi SuperBrony64
<MASF123> Kick who?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai LoGaN :3
<Ninjazz|Away> ...I can buy that.
<Reikim> Vinyl x Octavia does boil down to a sitcom ship.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I see you only noticed me because mah Xbox 360 is on :3
<Reikim> That
<LoGaN> i see your on xbox
<Reikim> That's actually a really good way of describing it.
<Ponies47> Dat Demoman plot
*Reikim takes notes.
<Ninjazz|Away> Holy crap. It is!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because I misread what you said and thought you were doing immature spamming.
<cachi01|mobile> I want a CPU only because i already have a monitor
<LoGaN> Moo :3
<XylemTube> Shake it!
*Ninjazz|Away is now imagining an entire show like Epic Wub Time with canned laughter.
<cachi01|mobile> Screen*
<MASF123> eh...I don't even know anymore. T_T
<Canadian_Brony> XAX I have a good widescreen monitor as my primary and I recently hooked up a small VGA monitor. I need to piss around with the colour settings on it, but otherwise it's awesome!
<MALK> Oh ok Nittany_Discord I know what you mean now
<Reikim> Bass Cannon
<Reikim> Qualifies as a WMD.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01wish he had a rainblower too.
<Ponies47> ^
<Canadian_Brony> That doesn't look like a tank
<XAX> Canadian_Brony: My old CRT has never had any problems :D love the thing
<Ninjazz|Away> It stopped Discord.
<Ninjazz|Away> DIS.
<Ninjazz|Away> CORD.
<Aircrafter> Sup Everypony!
<XAX> Nittany_Discord: What would thou trade for one?
<Ponies47> hey Aircrafter! :)
<XAX> Aircrafter :D
<Ninjazz|Away> It's a Apocolypse machine.
<MASF123> There are Tanks in TF2?
<Ninjazz|Away> an*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XAX: Dunno.
<MALK> Howdy Aircrafter
<Canadian_Brony> hi Aircrafter. Shizuka is playing Mann vs Machine
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MASF123: Only in MvM.
<Ponies47> MASF123: Just for MvM
<Canadian_Brony> I stand corrected!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What do you want XAX?
<MASF123> WHat? From L4d?
*Aircrafter glomps Canadian_Brony , MALK , XAX, and Ponies47.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No. Mechanical tanks.
*Ponies47 Hugs Aircrafter back :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Watch stream.
<Dark_Horst> MASF123: mann vs machine. new mode
<Dken2021> yay late night biscuits!
<Canadian_Brony> Oomph!
<MirrorImage> isn't the Rainblower craftable?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MirrorImage: Dunno.
<cachi01|mobile> All this crafting confuses me
<MASF123> My stream lags too much for me to see. I'll refresh it now.
<Reikim> Quick, what is a place/location that is known for being seldom used?
<Ponies47> SEE!?!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't see it as craftable earlier today.
<Ninjazz|Away> Froggy Bottom Bog or whatever they call it.
<Canadian_Brony> MirrorImage Nittany_Discord Yes, you could try your luck with weapon and slot tokens
<Canadian_Brony> and a scrap
<Reikim> Agh
<Reikim> No
<Ninjazz|Away> Hmmm?
<MirrorImage> Canadian_Brony - i should...
<Reikim> I mean, not actually used
<Polydunami> Decided to request a vhost :$
<MirrorImage> when the Sharp Dresser came out, i got one on my first token craft
<MirrorImage> made a tidy profit that day
<Reikim> Not as in used in fanfiction
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The only time you I don't have enough stuff to craft tokens.
<Reikim> As in, people almost never use it.
<Ninjazz|Away> ...
<Reikim> Or actually
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And a run-on sentence.
<Reikim> How about a really stupid kitchen utensil?
<Canadian_Brony> it would take 3 craftable Primary weapons, 3 crafatble Pyro weapons, and whatever gives you a scrap.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't have enough stuff to craft tokens.
<MirrorImage> you know... just for shiggles, i should go try a token craft...
<Ninjazz|Away> A potatoe masher?
<MirrorImage> i've got 3 strange axtinguishers that no one will want that i could use for the pyro token
<Reikim> Please.
<Canadian_Brony> you have a 1/4 chance of getting a Rainblower
<Reikim> Those are used all the time.
<Ninjazz|Away> >.<
<Ponies47> Meanwhile keeps wasting his ammo :P
<Meanwhile> You keep wasting my ammo. >:I
<Ponies47> O.O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I could use more strange weapons. I thought you could only buy strange weapons.
<Reikim> The inverse of a rice cooker, basically.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The only strange items I have are from trades.
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - buy or get them from crates
<Ninjazz|Away> A rice uncooker?
<MirrorImage> which is essentially buying them...
<MirrorImage> errr... buy as in trade
<Ponies47> I always just trash my crates.
<MirrorImage> either way, off to try and make a rainblower!
<otakon> okay guys I'm out
<otakon> it's 1 am
<Reikim> In terms of utility.
<cachi01|mobile> Cta otakon
<Ponies47> Night otakon :)
<Canadian_Brony> Strange weapons can be found by opening crates with keys. You can buy the keys in the Mann Co. Store or via Trading. The crates come in random drops or via trading.
<cachi01|mobile> Cya*
<superretroworld> night otakon
<otakon> I'm a bit bored since I can't get TF2 to work proper atm
<Canadian_Brony> seeya otakon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I traded a flaming crate for 3 strange weapons.
<Ninjazz|Away> Mmmm. That's what you mean by stupid.
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Night!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know how crates work.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: how come you're UI looks differnt?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This is Shizuka streaming, and she's using a mod.
<Canadian_Brony> I got the equivalent of a REFINED just by selling crates I collected
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: oh that explains the Pyro
<MirrorImage> AHAHAHA
<MirrorImage> oh god, i did it!
<Jmo4267> Nittany_Discord, you need a rainblower?
<Heathgamer> vinyl scratch is best ponny
<MirrorImage> i crafted a rainblower!
<otakon> Shizuka: GO GIRL GO! BURN IT ALL!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd like a rainblower.
<Canadian_Brony> MirrorImage bullshit!
<Ninjazz|Away> Gragh! I got nothing.
<Jmo4267> Want one for free? I've got an extra.
<Ponies47> Shizuka is a dang good Pyro O.O
<Heathgamer> whats up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Jmo4267: Sure.
<MirrorImage> do i need to have shizuka display the item to prove it?
<Ponies47> Nothing much Heathgamer :P
<Heathgamer> cool
<Jmo4267> Aight, lemme throw you an add on steam.
<Polydunami> Why does that guy saying "Kaboom" remind me of playing the battleship knockoff in Wind Waker?
<cachi01|mobile> So if i get some sticks and some cobblestone i can make a TF2 Pickaxe?
<LoGaN> goodnight everypony! including SuperBrony64
<Shizuka> 13enjoying the show?
<Canadian_Brony> hi Heathgamer Shizuka is streaming Mann vs Machine and we're discussing weapons
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...cannot unhear, Polydunami
<otakon> Polydunami: that's not kaboom
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka buck yeah!
<Ponies47> Shizuka: Yesh :3
<otakon> Polydunami: that's SPLOOSH
<Reikim> That's fine, I came up with something else.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Night LoGaN :)
<Shizuka> 13this is Trance Around the World #270 you're hearing
<otakon> Shizuka: wonderful fun with flames
<Canadian_Brony> g'night LoGaN
<MirrorImage> #270?
<MALK> Yes Shizuka
<MirrorImage> what about #1 - #267?
<Ponies47> Night LoGaN :)
<Heathgamer> who is shizuku?
<Polydunami> But when you hit a big octo, otakon, he goes KABOOM!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I also wish I had an extra Huntsman to craft a medic crossbow.
<MirrorImage> and #268 and #269 since i obviously can't type
<Canadian_Brony> Heathgamer a mod
<Ninjazz|Away> A freezer box that slowly warms things?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or the medic crossbow.
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Yes!
<Heathgamer> link me
<Jmo4267> Gimme a few minutes Nittany_Discord, in a match.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Jmo4267: OK.
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord Crusader's Crossbow. I think I have one kicking around my pack.
<Polydunami> I didn't realize a song was playing :S
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have 5 ubersaws XD
<Ponies47> I made my own MvM server and locked it with a password. i played by myself in MvM! it was awesome! XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I actually used one in a craft.
<Ponies47> I died alot...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I used 3 extra crit colas as well.
<MirrorImage> eh, i just use the Create Server button in game when i want to MVM
<Ponies47> And failed alot...
<Polydunami> This has a pretty neat tune
<Polydunami> Ambience
<Ponies47> Guess I should of invited a few to join in :$
<Reikim> The knobs on a television set.
<MirrorImage> turns out it's really not that hard to make a temporary server when you actually know what you're doing in a router
<MirrorImage> leave the port forwarding set permanently and it's 3 console commands to have your server open to the general public
<Canadian_Brony> . . . I just found out I have a Phlogistinator.
<Canadian_Brony> wow
<Polydunami> ??
<Polydunami> Explain?
<MirrorImage> me?
<MirrorImage> or canadian?
<Polydunami> No, I was looking for a definition of Phlogistinator
<MirrorImage> the flamethrower shizuka is using
<MirrorImage> the laser flamethrower
<Polydunami> Oh
<Canadian_Brony> yeah
<Canadian_Brony> you want stats?
<Panda> wait... who is streaming
<MirrorImage> shizuka is
<Panda> Shizuka?
<Panda> oh
<AJIsAwesome> Yes.
<Polydunami> No, I'm fine without specs :P
<Canadian_Brony> hi Panda. Eeyup
<Ponies47> I need to get more space for my backpack. I keep having to delete other things to make room :(
<MirrorImage> i need to find someone to buy all my crates
<Heathgamer> school is starting back its going to suck
<MirrorImage> i've got about 1 page full of them right now
<superretroworld> Ponies47: welcome to skyrim
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder. If I use a strange item in a craft, will the item I craft be strange as well?
*Ninjazz|Away scratches his head. "I'm not sure how this game works."
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 hmm, you're running F2P
<Dark_Horst> got crates too. anyone wanna?
<MirrorImage> and not enough free cash to just say "eff it" and buy all those keys
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - no
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord no it won't be
<XAX> Nittany_Discord: I dun tink so :c
<Panda> How do you craft on TF2 anyways?
<AJIsAwesome> Heathgamer: IKR
<MirrorImage> Panda - the "Craft" button
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Yeah. Is there a problem? :$
<MirrorImage> its basically glorified cooking with a cookbook
<MirrorImage> it tells you what to throw in and tells you what you'll get out
<MirrorImage> repeat about 20 times per item
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 no. I ran F2P for the first few months of playing.
<AJIsAwesome> DAT RHYTHMIC WEAPON SWAP
<superretroworld> why do you need a flair gun?
<MirrorImage> superretroworld - why not?
<Panda> MirrorImage no i mean... like... does it tell you what it makes?
<Canadian_Brony> superretroworld long-distance damage
<MirrorImage> Panda - most of the time
<superretroworld> oh
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: I see. I just need to buy somthing from the store to make more space in my backpack correct?
<MirrorImage> there's two types of crafting - Token and Not-Token
<MirrorImage> the not token stuff straight up says "Give me these genericly defined items and i'll give you this"
<Panda> MirrorImage Ive never tried, im still quite a noob :( forgive me.
<MirrorImage> token stuff takes non-token crafting for a brief moment, and at the final step decides randomly what to give you
<Polydunami> Goodnight everypony.
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Polydunami
<Ponies47> Night Polydunami :P
<MirrorImage> it's not terribly difficult to pick up
<superretroworld> night Polydunami

<Polydunami> I'm out
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: Night!:)
<ShadowDash> POO
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You know what's funny? Baloonicorn being $18 in the store.
<Ponies47> Pootis!
<Panda> Nittany_Discord O_O it is?
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: O_O
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - you're surprised about that and not the Something Special for Someone Special?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think so.
<Panda> Someone gifted me a balloonicorn O_O
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MirrorImage: Is that the think that sends a message to everyone in the game?
<MirrorImage> yes
<MirrorImage> for $100
<MirrorImage> not a typo
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shit.
<MirrorImage> one-zero-zero
<Ponies47> I'm pretty most of the people that have Baloonicorns are bronies most likely renamed it to either Twilight Sparkle or Rarity :P
<Buytoast> Ah yess, the $100 ring in the Mann Co Store
<Dark_Horst> the shop guys are insane
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's outrageous.
<MirrorImage> Dark_Horst - and evil geniuses too
<cachi01|mobile> Or pinkie pie <_<
<Dark_Horst> Buytoast: what'S that?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I could go nuts on a steam sale for $100.
<MirrorImage> how much pure money did Valve make off of that item?
<Buytoast> the funny part is valve has made thousands off that ring
<MirrorImage> Buytoast - i'd easily peg it at over $700k
<Reikim> That's okay, such confusion tends to be normal around me at this hour.
<MirrorImage> because we're idiots like that <_<
<Aircrafter> A ring...for $100...that does what?
<Buytoast> Nothing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sad truth about gamers: The average gamer is a terrible consumer.
<Shizuka> 13i am so overpowered X3
<Buytoast> it's purely cosmetic
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry, never played TF2. What ring are you talking about?
<Ponies47> Shizuka: O.O
<Aircrafter> Buytoast: ....-triple over 9000 facepalm-
<MirrorImage> AJIsAwesome - back on valentines day
<Dark_Horst> i make it a standard not to pay anything for a f2p game
<MirrorImage> valve released an item to the store
<MirrorImage> for $100 - "Something Special for Someone Special"
<Buytoast> Speaking of purely cosmetic useless shit.
<Buytoast> Who wants a free hat.
<MirrorImage> you gift it to someone, like a wedding ring
<Ponies47> Buytoast: Pwease? :3
<MirrorImage> and it pops up a message across all serves about the exchange
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord good thing I'm not an "Average gamer" than. I have put only $10 towards TF2
<AJIsAwesome> MirrorImage: That's it?
<MirrorImage> that's it.
<Buytoast> it's an engineer hat.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not saying anyone here is an average gamer.
<Buytoast> the one that makes you bald.
<Canadian_Brony> I know
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01consumer.
<Aircrafter> Dat dancin' pinkeh.
<Ponies47> Buytoast: I play as Engineer alot! I'll take it :P
<Buytoast> fine
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I heavily vote with my wallet for example.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Been doing so for years.
<Canadian_Brony> I just wanted to point out I wasn't average.
<AJIsAwesome> MirrorImage: Wow.:O That's pretty stupid.
<magmablock> Time to man some machines... to HELL!!
<Aircrafter> Buytoast: What would happen if you use that hat...on the heavy?
<MirrorImage> to the "srs" gamer, yes
<MirrorImage> to valve, it was absoultely brilliant
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The avg. gaming consumer is way too open with theirs.
<Buytoast> Probably nothing
<magmablock> I learned today that spy is awesome in this mode
<Buytoast> Valve knows their hat Simulator 2012 audience.
<Aircrafter> Well there goes my conspiracy theory....
<magmablock> Upgrade your sapper above all else
<cachi01|mobile> Spy is sappin mah machines?
<MirrorImage> magmablock - nah, here's what you do
<MirrorImage> Big Earner + Dead Ringer
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Most publisher know their audience...as cash cows with loose teets.
<MirrorImage> first wave, dump 2 points in +25 Health on Kill for the knife
<MirrorImage> THEN start dumping into sapper
<SaxyPretender> 0,14heh
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Teets
<cachi01|mobile> Dem teets
<MirrorImage> so now your knife, on a backstab, restores +30 Cloak and +50 Health
<Buytoast> But that's all people are to others these days.
<MirrorImage> and you have a dead ringer for when you're discovered
<Buytoast> Dollar signs.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's fine except when that thinking leads to highly-unethical business practices.
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord IKR? My friend has put over $200 into TF2 because he "doesn't have anything else to do with it except Yu Gi Oh cards". I always ask him why he isn't saving up for a car.
<Canadian_Brony> which I am
<magmablock> Sapper can be maxed out by the end of the second wave if you're good at collecting cash, but to each his own, I guess
<Buytoast> yu gi oh is still around?
<Buytoast> holy shit
<Canadian_Brony> despite having a couple years to go
<MirrorImage> magmablock - perhaps, but the health on knife allows you to be a little more reckless
<cachi01|mobile> Why save for a car when you can buy hats?
<Canadian_Brony> Buytoast it is, and it's popular here. We have a Great White and they host tournaments every Saturday
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: IKR? Did you hear about Yu0Gi-Oh 5DS?
<Buytoast> i ahven't seen a yu-gi-oh card since the thousand eyes relinqush thing was
<XAX> MirrorImage: Is that the perks of the Big Earner?
<MirrorImage> and you can have the sapper upgraded "enough" by the end of the third
<Ponies47> cachi01|mobile: HATS!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially when you get a company run by an MBA, who puts logical profit-seeking above the human element.
<Panda> How do you make the pyro secondary gun, the one that makes continuous burn damage?
<MirrorImage> XAX - by default it's +30 Cloak on Kill
<XAX> MirrorImage: Ah.
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01|mobile because I look for things with practicallity in the real world
<MirrorImage> add +50 Health on Kill for mvm and it's nuts with the Dead Ringer
<cachi01|mobile> Canadian_Brony like hats?
<MirrorImage> and just stupid once you get your sapper upgraded
<bioshock> YES
<bioshock> Wait whart?
<bioshock> DAMMIT
<bioshock> WRONG PROFILE
<MirrorImage> *sap* *stab* x15 *dead ring* *RUN AWAY!!*
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01|mobile if you mean a hat I can wear IRL, I only need one.
<bioshock> I MEANT SLENDERMAN
<bioshock> One sec :(
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01|mobile TF2 hats? Pfft, I'm not a hardcore trader
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Companies exist to make money, but some go too far in trying to make money.
<Canadian_Brony> I bought one hat: the Trophy Belt.

<Canadian_Brony> but Cartridges won't be lost if you lose the SD card or it gets wiped

<XylemTube> THe phlog looks top tier on MvM
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Canadian_Brony: Yeah...but the box ><

<Shizuka> 13bleh
<Ninjazz> That's an effective strategy. Pyro and medic to collect the cash while others watch over the other entrances.
<Canadian_Brony> SuperBrony64 if you get it in-store, you will get the awesome box, you won't lose a $50 game if you lose your SD card, you'll have MUCH more space on it, and you can easily transfer between systems.
<Ninjazz> Should think about that next time when I get my ass handed to me on the same round repeatedly.
<Shizuka> 13
<Shizuka> 13bad time for comcast fail
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka did it?

<MASF123> My laptop is glitched. On Defragmentor it says I have like 100Mb fre space, however I have 0% free space. I need 15% free space for it to work properly.

<Shizuka> 13hope ponies were not too bored
<wowviewer> Not really. Thanks for the stream :P
<Ninjazz> Naw, Shizu. Watching you burn robots to death is always fun.
<Ninjazz> Thanks for streaming. ^_^
<Shizuka> 13i figured tf2 would be more exciting than watching me photoshop and tweak code
<killerpony7733> TF2 is usually always fun
<killerpony7733> :P
<Shizuka> 13ponies probably get enough of photoshop from our art streamers
<Shizuka> 13do not need my amateur web graphics boring them
<Jmo4267> Pfft, nothing wrong with seeing some more art.
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/U93xw.png
<Shizuka> 13that is the kind of thing you would be seeing
<Jmo4267> Kewl
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> hmm?
<wowviewer> Art is something to appreciate it every once a while. Don't worry about it
<MASF123> What the hell?
<MASF123> Reminds me of Money Ball
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Science made fun?
<MASF123> Monkey Ball
<MASF123> And a little bit og Marble Blast
<MASF123> of
<MASF123> Ok so.....
<Ninjazz> SB streaming?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> yes
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yesh ^-^
<wowviewer> Heh nice
<Ninjazz> No wonder. Go, SB!
<wowviewer> Dat lag lol
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> lol
<MASF123> Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, and Day of Defeat were all mods players made and Valve bought?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> yes
<MASF123> Wow Valve is lazy
<Ninjazz> Yes, originally mods.
<Ninjazz> No that's a good plan.
<wowviewer> ?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> well not Team Fortress classic i think
<Ninjazz> See, that's working with the community.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> ^
<MASF123> I also heard that L4D was not originally not developed by Valve.
<Ninjazz> Instead of iron handing like EA and Activision.
<MASF123> They bought it and remade it
<Ninjazz> MASF123, it was a Counter Strike mod at first.
<Ninjazz> Valve liked th idea.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> MASF123: i think it was a classic console game
<Jmo4267> You do their job and try to say they're lazy after.
<Buytoast> Gotta go fast.
<MASF123> I would lol
<MASF123> First I would need a degree
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Lol
<killerpony7733> Most games valve has published was originally mods, So anything that wasn't half-life was community made and they actually hired the mod makers
<Jmo4267> Lolol
<MASF123> Hurry for mods!
<killerpony7733> Those that made counter strike was hired, The portal 1 makers etc etc
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> Lol
<Ninjazz> It's funny though, isn't it? They only made Half Life and it's taking them forever to get it done.
<Buytoast> Just give in.
<MASF123> But the creators of Portal weren't mods they were working on Narbicular Drop before Valave bought it and it became Portal.
<Ninjazz> Dis music.
<Ninjazz> Awwww yeah.
<killerpony7733> So he is a quicksilver blob?
<MASF123> I find out that there is actually Half-Life 3 concept art hidden in the Half-Life 2: Episode 2 files folder.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> suuuure
<MASF123> Saw a video about ti
<MASF123> Ok whatever
<Jmo4267> Now you're just being too obvious Lol'd
<killerpony7733> MASF123: Valve has also released a very concept art images, But they are what? 2 or 3 in total
<killerpony7733> a very few*
<ponies_8989> can't sleep. so who's streaming
<MASF123> SuperBrpny64 is
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> who knows, Valve is probably making the best game ever

<wowviewer> Whoa
<MASF123> This game is mind fucking me
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Mooooo o.o
<wowviewer> It's like you made a short jump, but in reality you jumped far lol
<Jmo4267> Moo :3
<MASF123> Is the background 3D? I'm not so sure.
<Souporcat> probably
<wowviewer> What in the world? lol
<Majora_Colt> I loke trains
<Ninjazz> This is making me want to play Minecaft a bit.
<Majora_Colt> lolz what
<Majora_Colt> :D
<Ninjazz> Actually more Terraria.
<MASF123> Might be the first time a platformer gave me a headache...oh no wait, I'm wrong.
<Majora_Colt> TERRAORE
<Majora_Colt> FG
<Majora_Colt> What is this?
<MASF123> SM64, SMW, EWJ, Sonic...all gave me headaches wtf.
<MASF123> It's Fez.
<MASF123> Dispenser. :3
<Majora_Colt> OH
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> lol Zelda music
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG2> in a different tune
<MASF123> Question.
<Ninjazz> Dis music... so peaceful.
<MASF123> What do they call it Half-Life?
<Majora> flam
<MASF123> huh?
<AdamTheDuck> MASF123: Half life has something to do with science, something about nuclear decay
<Majora> okay
<Ninjazz> MASF123, something about the life of an atom and nuclear decay.
<MASF123> ok makes sense
<AdamTheDuck> MASF123: Can't remember exactly, but along the lines of half way through decay
<Ninjazz> And Gordon's a physists so it makes sense.
<MASF123> He's a scientist too
<Majora> yeah, your point?
<MASF123> shut up
<Ninjazz> A quantum physists.
<MASF123> Lol.
<AdamTheDuck> Just a scientist in the office... Yet he learns how to use over 10 military firearms...
<AdamTheDuck> In a single day after an outbreak.
<Spell-of-Gaming> What's this game? :3
<Ninjazz> AdamTheDuck, it's the suit.
<Majora> The raven on my fore-head thirsts for his blood!
<MASF123> Fez
<Ninjazz> Spell-of-Gaming, Fez, hai btw.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ooh, Fez.
<AdamTheDuck> Ninjazz: Really? It's all the suit, didn't know that.
<Majora> DAMN RIGHT NIGGA MM MM
<Spell-of-Gaming> Heard of it, but haven't played it yet.
<MASF123> The HEV suit wa experiemnted on Gordon first?
<Ninjazz> AdamTheDuck, well, I was mostly joking. But really Gordan is supposed to really just emulate us. The suit kinda keeps him alive but it's us that make him a killing machine.
<MASF123> I didn't play the first Half-Life, but this is mention in Episode 2
<AdamTheDuck> Ninjazz: Oh I know that the suit protects him, it's the fact that after a single day in the office he learns how to use several different firearms correctly.
<MASF123> What does HEV stand for?
<AdamTheDuck> Hazardous Environmental V-something
<MASF123> I know BFG in Doom stands for Big Fucking Gun
<Ninjazz> AdamTheDuck, well, let's think about this. (Possible Spoiler Alert for those who didn't play Half-Life 1) They were already sending expiditions into Xen before the Resonance Cascade incident. Perhaps he was already trained with firearms. Also, he's in a research facility that has experimental weaponry. Not too surprising if he knows how to use weapons.
<AdamTheDuck> Ninjazz: True... True...
<Shizuka> 13Hazardous EnVironment Suit
<Shizuka> 13HEV Suit
<MASF123> oh
<AdamTheDuck> Well that V makes sense
<AdamTheDuck> I was thinking more along the lines of Vest but I'm not too sure
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This music makes me feel like I'm playing Myst...
<Ninjazz> This music makes my desk feel so comfy~
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Do you all want me to keep playing this game? o.o
<MASF123> What's up with the crowbar?
<Ninjazz> Sure, SB.
<Jmo4267> Up to you SuperBrony64 :3
<wowviewer> Up to you
<MASF123> Um...IDK SuperBrony64
<Ninjazz> MASF123, that was just the first weapon that he happen to find.
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz: Well remember gordon lives in or did live in a facility with guards and all that along with shooting ranges so no surprise he knows how to handle a ton of weapons
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'll try another new game for now :)
<MASF123> Try 'Splosionman
<MASF123> The demo
<MASF123> And he's not gonna
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64, Get Dust :3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moo o.o
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, well, huh. Yeah, the ranges could have been practice for the expidition crews. But the guards are there to protect the facility and keep nosy people out of places.
<Maid_RainBow> MMMOOOOO!!!!
<MASF123> Well back to Half-Life Beta searching
<wowviewer> Oh this game
<XylemTube> what's this?
<wowviewer> Spelunky I believe
<CrimsonPhoenix> I liked this game better when it was free
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz: Yep but black mesa in general had armories a ton of places spread out and gordon being able to access them and have some form of weapons training was required of him, Cause remember how some of the crews sen't out had weapons and those ammo canisters?
<killerpony7733> Oh and the black mesa training program,
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, of course!
<killerpony7733> So theres alot of sense in how gordon knows how to handle firearms in general and all,
<Ninjazz> Bet he never thought he'd use them against all them aliens, US Marines and Combine, though.
<MASF123> Wow my first time looking at Half-Life gameplay the game has really come far.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well I'll be heading to bed now. Just remember everyone that this contest is still up. Guess the bid and win a free steam game. http://pastebin.com/MXnQ1Yt9
<MASF123> It looks fun even though it is old.
<MASF123> Tomorrow that contest is over.
<Ninjazz> Gnight, CrimsonPhoenix. Sleep well.
<MASF123> see you
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Night CrimsonPhoenix :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> the end of monday guessing ends and we'll just need to see the result

<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't think so
<CrimsonPhoenix> when I heard of this game first it said it was XBLA exclusive

<Vordox> And I'm not sure I've seen it before or not =P
<Phase4> 00,02u in dis game too?
<Vordox> Phase4: Visuals =P
<Vordox> I got to admit, it's a damn pretty game.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02ikr :D
<Vordox> I wonder how he made it
<Vordox> Some parts looks like Vectors.
<Vordox> Meaning it's either digitially done in code, or premade into Flash
<Vordox> The backgrounds are easily made in code from a proper BG point network.
<Phase4> 00,02it did look good
<Vordox> Impressive =P
<MASF123|afk> ok and I'm back.
<Phase4> 00,02doing vectors in real time is needlessly complex, but not imposible
<MASF123> Anyone play the first Half-Life?
<Phase4> 00,02years ago, it confused me
<Vordox> Phase4: It's not THAT hard..is it?
<Phase4> 00,02not really, i just didnt get the point of it
<Phase4> 00,02i shoot a guy, walk foward, now what?
<Ninjazz|Away> inb4 they killed Kenny!
<Vordox> Phase4: People like to make bit, not byte, Phase4 :P
<MASF123> Vectors? I don't even know how to start with the begininng of Flash

<Ninjazz> Vordox, nope. These guys were the first to head west.
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Pilgrims?
<Ninjazz> Amish are just people who don't like electricity.
<MASF123> If you cross your skis when going downhill, your gonna have a bad time.
