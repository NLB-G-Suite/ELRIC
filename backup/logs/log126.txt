<NewDCD> 9DAT GUNBUSTER
<Coopmore> hey everypony
<Shutterfly> lol if I want to watch this marathon i'll probably have to sneak into my parents room in order to keep the internet on late at night
<Sumica> Why must you torment me dcd
<SuperBrony64> Why will you need to sneak into your Parents room?
<IrOnLoRe> So curious, being as i recently just became a brony. Hope i don't offend,if i ask what you guys like about the show?
<Shutterfly> they're internet nazis -.-
<Shutterfly> they have a physical
<Shutterfly> timer
<Shutterfly> on the router
<KanyeEast> welcome to the herd
<SuperBrony64> The Plot :P
<Shutterfly> IrOnLoRe: what isnt their to like?
<Shutterfly> there
<Sumica> ps2 is pissing me off
<Shutterfly> how did I just make that mistake
<Shutterfly> i need sleep
<Shutterfly> staying up reading fanfiction multiple nights in a row = bad plan
<TerraH> Me too... but I don't think I'll be able to get any
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: You try getting a PS3 instead?
<Coopmore> welcome, personally, i like the fact that its intelligent humour, contains nonarbitrary but smart references, and its everything a cartoon should be
<TerraH> You can't play PS2 games on a PS3, silly pony!
<Sumica> I dont play enough with em any more to warent geting it.
<Shutterfly> Coopmore: also ITS OVER 9000!
<TrollightSparkle> Not the new ones ;)
<SuperBrony64> TerraH: Not the new ones, no.
<mib_wvphby> meh
<Sumica> my not playing it in so long is probaly way it's derping.
<Coopmore> that too
<Shutterfly> are you talking about a ps2?
<KanyeEast> I think the fan-base enhances the enjoyment of the show. Apart from the more...vocal weirdos there isn't anything that the fandom does that isn't awesome in some way
<awolf> TerraH : Explain why I can play PS2 games on my PS3 then?
<SuperBrony64> TerraH: If you had the original PS3, then yes you could.
<Coopmore> whats being played? or supposed to be played?
<Shutterfly> I still have mine and it functions fine
<NewDCD> 9why won't Aeon Genesis hurry up with the Alpha 1 translation
*Sumica trys a diffrent disk.
<Shutterfly> oh they took away the crosscompatability
<NewDCD> 9it has Gunbuster too
<NewDCD> 9and Eva
<Shutterfly> with the slim
<Shutterfly> and i think actually
<TerraH> SuperBrony64: As far as I know, the old ones barely played any of the old games, either. They were having too much trouble with that
<Shutterfly> anything but the original release
<mib_wvphby> the slim is awesome
<Shutterfly> cant play ps2 games
<Shutterfly> i have a slim too
<SuperBrony64> TerraH: Haha, no they weren't. I owned one and they worked fine. They removed it because the hardware to play PS2 games natively was keeping the price of the system too high.
<Shutterfly> god xboxs
<awolf> dumb ps2
<awolf> why won't you work
<Shutterfly> also i dont think you're ps2 should have proken
<Sumica> odd a ps2 that wont play ps2?!
<Shutterfly> broken
<TerraH> SuperBrony64: Ah, is that the problem. I never payed them much attention until the price went down
<SuperBrony64> The new ones can only play PS1 games and PS3 games. There is the possibility to emulate PS2 games one the platform, but Sony hasn't done research with it yet.
<awolf> OH GOD THE NOSTALGIA
<Shutterfly> i played battlefront 2 recently
<Shutterfly> and nearly died from nostalgia
<Coopmore> hey guys, add me on steam, coopmore
<awolf> ...
<Shutterfly> games?
<SuperBrony64> The original PS3 basically contained a full PS2 system on the motherboard.
<Shutterfly> Coopmore:
<TrollightSparkle> Battlefront.. Star Wars Battlefront?
<Sumica> ...ok back to old game i guess
<NewDCD> 9also Sumica
<NewDCD> 9in SRW Z2
<awolf> They condensed a ps2
<Coopmore> shutterfly ?
<TerraH> You'd think they'd be able to figure out something better...
<Shutterfly> TrollightSparkle: yes, battlefront 2
<awolf> and put it into the ps3
<Shutterfly> Coopmore: the steam games u play
<awolf> then added something that recognizes the system differences
<NewDCD> 9one of the battle quotes for Simon and Kamina when using the Who-the-Hell-Do-You-Think-I-Am Kick is actually both of them yelling "SUPER INAZUMA KIIIIIIIIIIIICK"
<Sumica> lol nice.
<Natleyn> Fuck yes.
<Natleyn> <3
<SuperBrony64> They were able to emulate PS1 games on the system perfectly so you can play original PS1 games on the new PS3s, but they haven't done anything to make PS2 games play emulated on the system.
<Coopmore> Shutterfly a ballslods
<Sumica> yeah so it seems to be acting up with ps2 games
<Coopmore> load
<Coopmore> like 40+
<Shutterfly> lol ballslods
<Polarfire> Epic-chat is so dead its almost painful.
<Shutterfly> alright
<Shutterfly> i only play lfd2 and tf2
<IrOnLoRe> Thanks for the welcome btw, and yes i agree with you coop,I never expected I'd like it as much as i do. I must say a lot of the fan works, are good also.
<MUTANTPANDA521> are the stars moderators?
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: Throw it out the door and pick up another PS2 on the cheap :P
<Shutterfly> i have a tone of other pc games though
<Coopmore> cant run tf2 on this crappy laptop so i play ut2004 on the crap comp
<Shutterfly> and ps3 games
<Sumica> yeah it's looking thatway
<Shutterfly> Coopmore: ah
<mib_wvphby> good ol playstation logo the memorues
<Coopmore> and audiosurf and stuff
<SuperBrony64> MUTANTPANDA521: Moderators have colored text.
<awolf> ps2 that can't play ps2 games
<Coopmore> i just have too many games
<Sumica> might have to show anime or noting.
<mib_wvphby> re4
<Shutterfly> nice, shadowbolt coopmore
<MUTANTPANDA521> 0ya i got a warning for accidently using it..
<Coopmore> yeah
<TerraH> I have a lot of PS2 and Game Cube, and Wii and N64 and Super Nintendo and Nintendo and Gameboy and DS and a few PS3s
<Shutterfly> how did you make the lightning
<awolf> 0never use color text?
<Shutterfly> is that in ascii?
<Shutterfly> its reseverd for mods awolf
<SuperBrony64> Color text is only for Mods.
<awolf> 0aww, but i wanted to use black text
<SuperBrony64> Plus it's just annoying if everyone used it.
<Coopmore> problem with ps2 was it wasnt compatible with the ps2 games
<TerraH> I have three bookshelves worth of anime :p
<TerraH> AND the new Trigun movie
<Coopmore> i copied from the leader, silentthought
<mib_wvphby> bleach
<Shutterfly> portal 2 is a good game
<Sumica> old ps2 is old
<Coopmore> always a few of us on the brony servers
<SuperBrony64> Correction, Portal 2 is an excellent game.
<Shutterfly> lol have you guys seen the portal 2 endsong my little pony crossover?
<Shutterfly> theres a remixed song w luna
<TerraH> yes
<SuperBrony64> It's set the bar real high for what I expect from a game today haha
<Shutterfly> i think it may have been on eqd at some point
<Coopmore> portal 2 was good, but i think yahtzee was accurate, it just didnt live up because portal one was just too SURPRISINGLY good
<MUTANTPANDA521> 0Dead space 2 all the way
<SuperBrony64> Coopmore:â€¦what?
<mib_vt9p9t> theres a remixed song with luna of everything
<Shutterfly> portal 2 caught the world by surprise Coopmore
*TrollightSparkle brohoofs MUTANTPANDA521.
<Shutterfly> *1
<Coopmore> too much was expected of it
<mib_wvphby> osu
<Coopmore> like dnf. it was fantastic
<Shutterfly> wtf i _cannot_ type tonight
<BA> DEAD SPACE 1 IS BETTER -_-
<Coopmore> never mind
<BA> srry caps
<IrOnLoRe> Is Dead space 2, any good?
<MUTANTPANDA521> 0TrollightSparkle brohoof back'
<TrollightSparkle> Both Dead Spaces are better. /discussions.
<SuperBrony64> Coopmore: I didn't expect any of what it brought in the game.
<BA> its amazing
<Coopmore> i did not mean to compare to dnf
<TerraH> I have Deadspace 2... but I haven't played 1 yet, so I should get on that
<Nittany_Tiger> Has /any/ game lived up to its hype lately.
<Nittany_Tiger> ?
<Shutterfly> uh
<Coopmore> its great, but i thought it was too easy
<awolf> 0No. People overhype ALL the things
<TrollightSparkle> Well, we'll see about BF3.
<Shutterfly> TrollightSparkle: yes
<mib_wvphby> bf3
<BA> um not that i know of
<TerraH> I thought that Mass Effect lived up to the hype...
<Coopmore> the great thing about portal 1 was that all the walls were white
<Nittany_Tiger> EA will ruin BF3.
<Coopmore> slamost
<SuperBrony64> Coopmore: Wait for DLC to come out for difficult tests.
<Nittany_Tiger> In fact, they already have.
<TrollightSparkle> BF3, Uncharted 3, Rage..
<Shutterfly> Nittany_Tiger: thats quite the ultimatum
<Nittany_Tiger> I hate publishers.
<TrollightSparkle> Although Rage doesn't look.. great.
<Coopmore> so it wasnt merely trial and error, but true puzzlingness
<mib_wvphby> cod mw 3
<Shutterfly> Nittany_Tiger: hard for games to exist without them
<SuperBrony64> Nittany_Tiger: EA has been publishing Battlefield for the longest time now...
<TrollightSparkle> Ew MW3.
<TrollightSparkle> No offense anon.
<BA> MW3 is going to be alto more like cod4
<Shutterfly> anyone heard of just cause 2?
<BA> yes
<TrollightSparkle> Heard of Just Cause, wanted to play it.
<Coopmore> call of duty is not an inherently bad game, but its community ruins the game
<Shutterfly> TrollightSparkle: its worth it
<Coopmore> its great, but as tb said, its have gun shoot man
<SuperBrony64> Shutterfly: I have Just Cause 2 on OnLive but I haven't really played much of it.
<BA> agreed coopmore
<Nittany_Tiger> But many publishers are abusing consumer rights and milking gamers.
<Shutterfly> TrollightSparkle: the game is the most massive game i've over seen
<IrOnLoRe> I agree, an it's match making is bad.
<Coopmore> most basic of game
<Coopmore> games
<SuperBrony64> It's a fun game that's very similar to the sandbox style of GTA.
<TrollightSparkle> Shutterfly Is it multiplatform?
<Natleyn> Just Cause 2...
<Shutterfly> Coopmore: i just like the massivemenss
<Natleyn> All you need to know
<Shutterfly> TrollightSparkle: not sure, i have it on ps3
<Natleyn> Is that a parachute and a grappling hook
<SuperBrony64> TrollightSparkle: Yeas it is, Xbox 360, PS3 and PC
<Natleyn> BEST TRANSPORTATION EVER
<TrollightSparkle> Then yeah, probbaly.
<Shutterfly> Natleyn: indeed
<Shutterfly> you have infinite parachutes
<Natleyn> I almost wish I had something like that at college.
<Shutterfly> that appear out of nowhere
<TerraH> The best transportation was the grapple hook in Goldeneye :p
<MUTANTPANDA521> 0guess what is the best thing ever....oreos
<Natleyn> Getting to class would be so easy.
<Coopmore> its great in itself, and i love its local, because generally the people there are within punching range, so they arent acting like anuses
<awolf> 0The parachute obviously repacks itself.
<Shutterfly> the game completely disregards any realism
<TrollightSparkle> Oreos AND milk. Let's not leave that out.
<Nittany_Tiger> There was no grapple hook in Goldeneye.
<Shutterfly> but somehow has reasonable physics
<Shutterfly> except when it comes to your character
<Nittany_Tiger> Unless you're talking about the Nazivision version.
<Natleyn> TrollightSparkle: Lets put it like this: You can surf a 747.
<Shutterfly> also the voice acting is deadly bad in an unapologetic way
<TrollightSparkle> There was a grapple hook in Nightfire, and Tomorrow Never Dies(I think).
<MUTANTPANDA521> 0TrollightSparkle oreos and milk is gross..
<mib_vt9p9t> the best transport is pigs in minecraft
<TrollightSparkle> Natleyn :O
<TerraH> Yeah there was. You culd swing around like Spiderman... I did it all the time
<awolf> 0grappling hook will rip your hand off
<Shutterfly> oh yeah u can do nearly anything
<MUTANTPANDA521> 0so who likes driving helicopters in bad company 2?
<BA> cant wait for Skyrim!
<Shutterfly> helicopters in bf2 MUTANTPANDA521
<Shutterfly> battlefield 2 is still fun XD
<SuperBrony64> What game is this now NewDCD?
<TrollightSparkle> I'm intent on trying Elder Scrolls and buying BF2.
<MUTANTPANDA521> 0jets in BF3 shutterfly
<Shutterfly> MUTANTPANDA521: I KNOW
<Shutterfly> MUTANTPANDA521: i dont know why they took them out for bc2
<Shutterfly> and
<Shutterfly> 1
<BA> elder scrolls is a great game of you like rpg's

<BA> so if you were like a mage and you want to be a theif then just do theif stuff
<mib_wvphby> yes
<TrollightSparkle> Haven't played Mass Effect either.. I'm such an outcast ._.
<MUTANTPANDA521> 0best rpg ever
<Shutterfly> TrollightSparkle: its a good series, but they're half movies
<Coopmore> and it can be good fun, like knife fights, or pistols only and stuff
<TerraH> Mass Effect is such a wonderful series. I can't wait for 3
<BA> THEY NEED MASS PONY!
<TerraH> YES!
<mib_wvphby> lol
<Shutterfly> there's probably already a fanfic
<MUTANTPANDA521> 0BA *like*
<SuperBrony64> TrollightSparkle: Me neither.
<TerraH> Or PONY FANTASY 13!!
<BA> battle pony 3
<TrollightSparkle> FF13 was.. alright.
<mib_wvphby> lmmfao
<Shutterfly> i think my little pony may have the highest ratio of fan content hours to canon hours ever
<BA> modern warmare 3
<IrOnLoRe> I played the first Mass effect, just a little bit anyway.
<TerraH> I never cared for the Final Fantasy games. I was just naming a random number
<TrollightSparkle> Dead Pony :D
<TrollightSparkle> (Dead Space)
<mib_wvphby> ff7 was the best in my opinion
<BA> grr u beat me to it!
<TrollightSparkle> Dead ponies aren't cool.. ._.
<MUTANTPANDA521> 0TrollightSparkle *like*
<TrollightSparkle> Necromorph ponies on the other hand.. :P

<Shutterfly> Fluttershy77: yeah
<TerraH> Even that was SO graceful!
<Fluttershy77> my point exactly~
*Natleyn hugs Fluttershy77
<Fluttershy77> Eep!
<Willzack> OH MAH GHOD!!!
<Fluttershy77> Hugged by a stranger...
<Shutterfly> wait whats the 'aside' command

<Shutterfly> the natleyn hugs fluttershy and the like
<TerraH> you just type /me and your message
<Natleyn> o3o
<SuperBrony64> Just clarifying on something, Princess Celestia and Luna are both classified as Eagle Poniesâ€¦?
<Natleyn> ^What?

<Fluttershy77> Alicorns
<SuperBrony64> Oh okay lol nvm
<TerraH> /me love this
<Willzack> lol, eagle pony
<Fluttershy77> that what I thought
<TerraH> equals
<SuperBrony64> Misheard the intro from the first episode.
*TerraH loves this
<Shutterfly> a.k.a. pegacorn i think
<Shutterfly> but that just sounds dumb
<Fluttershy77> Earth pony/Pegasus pony/Unicorn pony/Alicorn pony
<SuperBrony64> But wait, that doesn't sound anything like what they said in the intro
<SuperBrony64> They were like "There lived two Eagle sisters"
<SuperBrony64> Unless I just misheard something lol
<TerraH> Regal
<Willzack> Anyone else Excited for the Chaos Dragon??
<SuperBrony64> Oh OH OOOOOOOHHHH
<TerraH> :p
<Fluttershy77> Oh um
<Fluttershy77> Well
<Fluttershy77> I like to remember it by thinking of Luna.
<Shutterfly> im sure theres a transcript somwhere
<Fluttershy77> Since she was on the moon
<Fluttershy77> where...aliens live..
<Fluttershy77> Alicorn...
<Fluttershy77> but um
<TerraH> XD
<Fluttershy77> you don't have to say it like that
<Fluttershy77> if you don't want...
<SuperBrony64> I thought Alicorn was what the unicorn horns were made of?
<Shutterfly> 'alicorn' also means the material that makes up
<Willzack> Luna is the best at Space! XD
<Shutterfly> unicorn horns
<Shutterfly> yeah
<TerraH> Alicorn is actually what unicorn horn is made from (at least, according to wiki)
<Shutterfly> its both
<Willzack> i always read that as "allcorn"
<TerraH> A pony with a horn and wings is normally referred to as a pegacorn or a unasis
<Fluttershy77> Okay well um
<Willzack> because they have all the pony parts
<Fluttershy77> Thank you all very much.
<Fluttershy77> I'm glad you are all so friendly.
<xxapplebloommarexx> hi
<Willzack> Super muscles of a Earth Pony if thats a thing
<Shutterfly> Fluttershy77: bronies are generally friendly
<SuperBrony64> MLP WIkia just says she is classified as a Winged Unicornâ€¦that's good enough for me lol
<TerraH> That's what this community is all about! love and peace!
<Fluttershy77> I'll be back here for the friday all-nighter
<Fluttershy77> But until then.

<SuperBrony64> Willzack, lol that was one of the discussions we about a week ago :P
<TerraH> Ask?
<Fluttershy77> Can you save them as friends?
<Fluttershy77> Oh, I don't know...
<SuperBrony64> It's just a joke turns out lol
<TerraH> Don't think so...
<Sumica> oki gonna try and fail at a diffren dame for a bit, perhaps somthing with less quick time.
<Shutterfly> im pretty sure its alicorn unless a huge amount of fanficions are wrong
<Fluttershy77> What if they don't want to be my friend?
<SuperBrony64> Alicorn is the material that unicorn horns are made out of
<TerraH> They are
<SuperBrony64> Case closed :P
<TrollightSparkle> Sure you'll be fine :)
*Dermathil waves a goodnight to the chat.

<Fluttershy77> Hockey is fun ^^
<Fluttershy77> Sometimes it hurts my hooves.

<TerraH> Hockey is brutal...
<Dermathil> SuperBrony64: Hockey is fun, but ice fishing is much further north.
<SuperBrony64> Interesting! *notes it down in notebook* and as a native Canadian, what is your primary diet?

<Fluttershy77> Skiing? We have a bunch of rinks...
<Fluttershy77> but sometimes
<TerraH> Except for snails! cause french peoples (even canadian french) eat snails! and baquettes!
<Shutterfly> alpine skiing
<TwilightSparkle> I see nothing -_-

<Mauran> Well me and a bunch of other New Zealand bronies are gonna be tuning at 1am sunday morning to watch livestream on this site
<Fluttershy77> And baguettes are good...
*Dermathil sees so many people fascinated by French Canadians when one of the most veteran viewers of Bronystate is one.
<Shutterfly> as in mountain skiing
<Marisa> And Tim Horton's > McDonalds
<Natleyn> ^This
<TerraH> Yes thay are, Fluttershy77... yes they are...
<SuperBrony64> Tim Horton's kicks ass over Dunkin' Donuts

<Fluttershy77> O-Oh..?
*Dermathil is french canadian.
<Willzack> Tim Horton's kicks ass over Starbucks!
*Natleyn hugs Dermathil
<SuperBrony64> It's a shame we don't have Poutine down here in American McDonalds :(
<Marisa> There's some in the US even...
<xxapplebloommarexx> I request ratchet and clank: a crack in time, on the PS3 whos with me XD
<Marisa> I know D:
<TrollightSparkle> Dermathil mind=blown
*Mauran test
<Fluttershy77> Poutine is delicious.
<Dermathil> heheheheheheeh
*Mauran yay for emote!
<TrollightSparkle> Que es Poutine if I may ask?
<TerraH> I find making fun of entire peoples is fun, especially americans. Stupid fat americans...
<SuperBrony64> xxapplebloommarexx: I don't think they have a PS3 hooked up to play those games...
<Marisa> French fries and gravy and cheese
<Willzack> I Demand a JAK 3 Stream! :D
<Marisa> Nothing foreign about it to Amercans, really
<Fluttershy77> Poutine
<Fluttershy77> Well
<Fluttershy77> Its french fries
<Mauran> TerraH indeed!
<Fluttershy77> right.
<SuperBrony64> It's actually cheese and gravy with some fries mixed in :P
<Fluttershy77> With Gravy
<Fluttershy77> A-
<Marisa> xD
<Fluttershy77> R-right...
<TrollightSparkle> Mmm...
<Fluttershy77> that's what it is...
<TwilightSparkle> xxapplebloommarexx Im liking that idea
<Marisa> Yep
<Sumica> bleh no play ps2 for some reasion now.
<Sumica> so ps1 game
<Fluttershy77> I'm sorry for spoiling it...if you wanted to say it...
<SuperBrony64> Y U NO PLAY PS2?!
<Willzack> Hoooooey! cream gravy... HAHA!
<TerraH> Mauran: What do you mean by that? Huh? I'm american, you know!
<Fluttershy77> *Slumps into a bush*
<Sumica> so time for old
<SuperBrony64> You try cleaning the lens of the disc reader? Sumica
*Dermathil is still wondering if there would be an interest for a meet-up in french Canada.
<SuperBrony64> That's what my friend was having trouble with as well until he opened his up and cleaned the lens
<Shutterfly> Dermathil: isnt it kinda a large place?
*Dermathil will continue to wonder on the matter after a night of sleep though.
<Fluttershy77> I don't know how to wonder aloud.
<Marisa> Oh, night! :)
<Willzack> Anyone else here from CAL?
<Sebiale> An endlessly looping PS start screen?
<TrollightSparkle> So.. now good night Dermathil?
<Willzack> G'night whoever is sleeping, lol
<Shutterfly> Willzack: if cal as in california then yes
<Dermathil> Shutterfly: eeeyup, but most of the population is in the southern end of the province.
<Mauran> TerraH nice trolling, but nahh, i love the idea of america, i just think the general public consists of too many overweight (not always though) ignorant douchebags who dont even know where my home country of South Africa is. Seriously, i once told a bunch of americans where I was from and the closest they got to "The southern end of Africa" was England...
<Shutterfly> Dermathil: true, due to the climate
<SuperBrony64> Sumica: Just open up the PS2 and expose the disc drive. Once in, wipe the lens with a Q-Tip and some rubbing alcohol in a circular motion. Then wipe again with a drive Q-tip in the same motion.
<Fluttershy77> I told an american I was from canada once...
*Natleyn hugs Dermathil goodnight
<Dermathil> not just climate. Also due to where the settlements were founded back when the europeans arrived in America.
<Fluttershy77> when we visited disneyland
<sobuck> lol
*Dermathil waves.
<Natleyn> Wait, WHAT IS THIS
<Fluttershy77> He asked me if our igloo's melted in this weather.
<Natleyn> IS THIS FFVI
<SuperBrony64> Mauran: Wow, hate much?
<Sumica> ^_^
<Shutterfly> america has a lot of loud minorities
<Natleyn> I don't remember this verison
<TerraH> Really? That's sad... I really am American, but I usually at least TRY to find out about other cultures...
<Willzack> WAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!
<hmc1> Yeah, the majority of Americans speak bad things for those of us who actually try to keep a sense of civility
<Natleyn> Mauran is probably serious. We have a lot of stupid people.
<Fluttershy77> Um...
<SuperBrony64> Well, some people just don't know of the Country South Africa...
<Willzack> I ILL CREATE A MOUMENT TO NON-EXISTANCE!!!!
<Fluttershy77> can I ask everyone something?
<TrollightSparkle> Yes?
<Shutterfly> Fluttershy77: sure
<sobuck> ask away
<Natleyn> Like, a LOT of stupid people.
<hmc1> go for it
<SuperBrony64> :P
<Fluttershy77> Does anyone know the m/f ratio here?
<SuperBrony64> 99/1?
<TrollightSparkle> Nope.
<Natleyn> 100:0?
<Shutterfly> probably infinity to 1 on the male end
<Willzack> <--- Bro-ney
<hmc1> no, not really
<Mauran> SuperBrony64 not hate... I said I love america, i want to move there for a post-graduate and even work there, but i cant stand the ignorance of a LARGE ammount of the population
*TerraH is female
<Fluttershy77> I bet my friend 5 dollars there would be twice the male apperances
*Sumica knows 3 mods are female
<Fluttershy77> Fluttershy77 is female...
<TrollightSparkle> Don't know, I've never really thought it mattered too terribly much.. I mean, we all like the same thing.
*Marisa is female
<Shutterfly> i figured Fluttershy77
*Natleyn hugs everrpony
<Fluttershy77> I don't mean to be mean
<Mauran> SuperBrony64 Also, THE POSITION IS IN THE NAME FFS, AND AMERICANS KNOW ABOUT AFRICA!
<Fluttershy77> I just
<Marisa> ^^
<hmc1> I'm a dude
<Fluttershy77> Wanted to know.
*TerraH HUGGLES ALL!
<Shutterfly> it is pretty irrelevant though
<SuperBrony64> Mauran, but you just called a bunch of Americans 'douchebags'. That's not very nice. Plus it's stereotyping.
<sobuck> I agree with trollightsparkle
<Marisa> x33
<Fluttershy77> No no! It's okay
*Marisa huggles ^^
<Fluttershy77> Now I get 5 dollars!
<Mauran> SuperBrony64Right, and americans dont do that?
<Natleyn> xD
<TwilightSparkle> What game is it?
<Natleyn> Nice, Fluttershy77
<TerraH> Wait... what's africa? The only thing I know is Texas and steak!
<TrollightSparkle> Alright, you've convinced me.
<Shutterfly> Fluttershy77: was there a bet we wern't told about
<hmc1> Well, I'm American and I wouldn't hesitate to call a lot of us douchebags
<Natleyn> FFVI
<Sebiale> FF game
*TrollightSparkle gives Fluttershy77 5 dollars.
<Natleyn> Some version of it.
<Willzack> Kefka kicks sepheroths emo ass.
<Fluttershy77> Okay well...
<Fluttershy77> I'm very tired
*Mauran brohooves SuperBrony64
<Mauran> oops
<Sebiale> I recognized that Kefka dude.
<Mauran> my bad, stupid copy-paste
*Mauran unbrohooves SuperBrony64
<xxapplebloommarexx> ugh...really final fantasy -_-
<Fluttershy77> So
<Natleyn> Kefka is one of the best, if not THE best FF villain
<Willzack> RETRO!!!
*Mauran brohooves hmc1
<Fluttershy77> Tomorrow I'll get back here around 11:30

<Billaxle> Use X-FER!
<TwilightSparkle> Shutterfly Im up for a pony marathon to celebrate season 2!
<Billaxle> lol
<IrOnLoRe> How long is the Marathon?
<TerraH> Until season 2 airs
<RyuenTran> Whoa...stream sputtered
<TerraH> 9am
<Billaxle> Huzzah!
<SuperBrony64> About 9.5 to 10 Hours.
<Billaxle> lol
<Shutterfly> TwilightSparkle: its going to be terrible when we get massivly cliff hangered after all that isnt it?
<Shutterfly> its a 2 part episode eh?
<TerraH> yes... yes it is
<SuperBrony64> Eeyup.
<TwilightSparkle> YES shutterfly
<Billaxle> 9.5 is 24 episodes
<Billaxle> 10 would be 25
<Billaxle> lol
<SuperBrony64> They're technically about 22 minutes long, not 30 minutes lol
<Sumica> expect around 10 hours with breaks
<SuperBrony64> That's where I get that figure.
<TerraH> Very true
<Billaxle> so i guess 10 hours total if the new episode is right after
<Shutterfly> Billaxle: its 22 min each so 572 min aka 9.53 hrs
<SuperBrony64> Multiply 22 minutes by 26
<SuperBrony64> You get about 9.5
<Sumica> there will be breaks at eps 9 and 18
<Billaxle> wait
<SuperBrony64> Or 9.5 hours after dividing by 60
<Billaxle> are there 24 or 26 eps in Season 1?
<Shutterfly> 26
<SuperBrony64> 26 Episodes
<TwilightSparkle> *is scared of playing story of the blanks*
<Shutterfly> and they're completely out of order XD
<Billaxle> lol ok, nevermind.
<TerraH> 26 glorious eps

<Shutterfly> SuperBrony64: i've kept myself intentionally in the dark
<RyuenTran> I got spoiled some but I'm more of a "I'm gonna wait and see"
<TerraH> Shutterfly: I like it. I think I'm going to re-order my episode collection to reflect it...
<desertponi> i dont understand anyone who hasnt gotten a single thing spoiled for them if they frequent any pony site

<Mauran> Whats Happening In This Chat?

<Shutterfly> are these enemies realy bad or are the moogles just crazy powerful?
<Sumica> we have alot of RBD
<SuperBrony64> Here's your Pony fix: http://youtu.be/ZzIg0s7eKxs
<Billaxle> Trolls die in the silence
<Shutterfly> we probably got rid of him via not saying anything for a straight minute
<coopmore> eeeeeeyup
<desertponi> hi
<Shutterfly> darn
<KanyeEast> so anyway, who read lauren fausts interview?
<KanyeEast> that was great
<Shutterfly> me KanyeEast
<Shutterfly> i concur
<Shutterfly> she's quite the character
<KanyeEast> did she say she wasn't on the production staff anymore?
<Shutterfly> she is KanyeEast just pre-production though
<Shutterfly> but theres also and audio interview with what you could say is her 'replacement'
<Billaxle> Her Team is good enough to make it epic
<Shutterfly> and he seems like a boss too
<Shutterfly> and its not as if
<Shutterfly> she animated it
<Billaxle> from what i've seen, probably even MORE epic!@\
<Shutterfly> wrote it
<Shutterfly> lol Billaxle thats the hope
<Shutterfly> but probably
<Shutterfly> when has a show gotten worse in season 2
<KanyeEast> don't answer that
<Billaxle> there is going to be a chaos dragonpony
<Billaxle> its more than just hope, lol.
<Shutterfly> usually a reasonably good show doesnt go downhill production wise till like season 4 at elast
<Shutterfly> and this show is epic win
<KanyeEast> or if they make a movie
<Shutterfly> so i dunno
<Shutterfly> swhoah a movie
<Shutterfly> i dunno how that would work
<NewDCD> 9>Spend 4 bucks in a 0.3 mm Mechanical Drawing Pencil
<Shutterfly> probably some epic adventure story
<NewDCD> 9>3 days from the purchase date, it jams and is rendered unusable
<NewDCD> 9Fucking Staedler
<desertponi> PONIES
<Shutterfly> NewDCD: writing utensils are serious business
<desertponi> no wait
<desertponi> still not ponies
<Billaxle> dayum, that sucks NewDCD
<Shutterfly> Billaxle: that is pretty unlucky
<Shutterfly> i personally like pens though XD
<Shutterfly> i haz fountain pen
<KanyeEast> Mechanical Pencil > pens
<desertponi> i have a pony irl
<Billaxle> I prefer the manga pens i can buy online : P
<desertponi> i keep it in my house like a dog
<Shutterfly> KanyeEast: we're all entitled to an opinion
<Billaxle> like a fountain pen, but with an actual point indstead of a ball
<Shutterfly> yeah
<KanyeEast> its fine to like pens, I use quite a few myself
<Shutterfly> a nib its called
<desertponi> it lives in its own room
<Shutterfly> its alluminum
<KanyeEast> just the whole "un eraseable" part
<Shutterfly> KanyeEast: it is a problem, i hear they make a magical potion called white out though
<Billaxle> the nib isn't changeable
<Shutterfly> it is
<KanyeEast> yeah but when you're trying to take like 400 notes a second
<Shutterfly> if it breaks i can change it
<Sumica> So perhaps this guy should be BlueBlood? =p
<Shutterfly> its a literall fountain pen
<Billaxle> unless you swap out the nib from an evirely different pen
<NewDCD> 9can't even find my Oh-Fives now
<Shutterfly> using capillary action
<Shutterfly> its a changeable nib...
<KanyeEast> locke? why are you adventuring with an english philospher from the enlightenment?
<Billaxle> its designed with a ink release part attached to the nib
<Billaxle> a
<Shutterfly> u kno like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_pen
<Billaxle> and uses ink cartridges
<Shutterfly> yeah
<Shutterfly> exactly
<SuperBrony64> Why do they even call it a fountain pen? It doesn't even shoot out the ink like a fountain...
<Billaxle> its not like calligraphy pens imean
<Shutterfly> well
<Billaxle> where the nib is just one small metal peice stuck in a hole
<Shutterfly> those are slightly different
<Billaxle> lol
<Shutterfly> cause those have
<Shutterfly> a specific nib
<Billaxle> GOD I LOVE THIS THEME!!! >.< *NOSTALGIA!*
<Shutterfly> just a dif nib really though like a broad one allowing a range of line thickness
<desertponi> WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE PONIES
<SuperBrony64> If Nintendo just went straight to CDs for their Nintendo 64 Final Fantasy would have been on the N64 and possibly on the Gamecube.
<NewDCD> 9I'll have to use an Oh-Seven
<NewDCD> 9*groan* I hate Oh-Sevens

<Billaxle> Edgar is totally Applejack anyway
<SuperBrony64> Was just like "Any moment, the ban hammer is gonna come out..."
<Shutterfly> SuperBrony64: the sad thing about trolls is they tend to get a kick out of getting kicked XD
<Billaxle> and his brother is Big Macintosh
<Sumica> same you know the 6 letter only for names
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9but that's a warning kick
<SuperBrony64> Shutterfly: Maybe so, but there's always the permaban hammer.
<NewDCD> 9if he bothers too much I'm placing a ban
<Billaxle> When is he allowed back?
<SuperBrony64> Which I believe is Gold Plated and has diamonds on the handle.
<Shutterfly> in 1000 years
<Billaxle> he WAS annoying, but i can tell he wants the stream. lol
<Shutterfly> they should get banhammered to the moon for 1000 years
<IrOnLoRe> That's quite a long time.
<Billaxle> lol, thats how it works on my mincraft server : P
<KanyeEast> its not like he was trying to plunge the stream into eternal darkness or anything
<NewDCD> 9he already is
<SuperBrony64> That's how they do it for Xbox Live permabans. They set the ban-lift date to 12/31/9999 or something.
<Shutterfly> KanyeEast: brohoof
*KanyeEast brohoof
<Billaxle> Epic Brohoof

<SuperBrony64> Shutterfly: Should be better than before, they're using a better stream application.
<Shutterfly> alright
<SuperBrony64> I want to say it will be pretty good, but it might not be HD quality.
<Shutterfly> and Josef why would it be any worse?
<SuperBrony64> Bearable till someone uploads the HD version on YouTube :P
<mib_s8e07m> I need muffins...
<Surprise> Cuz Lauren quit pretty much?
<Shutterfly> lol im so used to my 720 p torrents and 1080p dvrs XD

<SuperBrony64> mib_s8e07m: Ditto, I'm so hungry I could eat a horse...

<Surprise> yeah but thats all
<Viethra> WHat if TYPO
<Surprise> she was over almost all of it
<Josef> lol
<Surprise> she stepped down A LOT
<Willzack> you forgot to go to south america!!! D:
<SuperBrony64> A lot of people say the SNES version is superior to the PS1 version of Chrono Trigger.
<mib_s8e07m> SuperBrony64: I hope they come out with a game like the show soon.
<Shutterfly> Surprise: its not like she did animation, script, or anything esle but managment basically
<Willzack> you also forgot to grind out 5000 gold : P
<Surprise> Actually if I'm not mistaken she was head storyboard designer (or something like that)
<SuperBrony64> mib_s8e07m: Same here, but if the creators don't then fans will.
<Shutterfly> Surprise: she gave the show direction, the 20+ rest of the staff isnt going to suddenly make a u-turn
<Shutterfly> she was partially that
<Surprise> I know that, but still
<SuperBrony64> However, if they don't have any say from the creators on making the game, then it will be pretty bad like previous MLP games.
<Surprise> ^
<Willzack> THE NEW EPISODE HAS A CHAOS DRAGONPONY!
<Willzack> THAT IS ALL.
<Josef> lol?
<Josef> wut
<Shutterfly> Willzack: lol yeah the new villans look cool

<Surprise> Lol yeah
<KanyeEast> no spoilers about Q
<Surprise> actually I think he has a more normal name than that
<SuperBrony64> But I'm also hoping for a Mario-Kart-esque MLP Kart game
<Surprise> and yeah
<Surprise> no spoilers
<Josef> i feel kinda dumb im the only person who put their actual name
<Willzack> its not spoilers because its shown on the HUB website, lol

<Surprise> uh
<Surprise> saturday IS movie night
<Surprise> oh wait
<Surprise> no thats tonight..
<interior_gummy> woah, season 2 spoilers are an instant ban?
<interior_gummy> would it be a spoiler to say that it involves ponies?
<Baka-Neku> SPOIL =D
<Baka-Neku> i did't kow that!
<interior_gummy> spoiler: the episode is NOT live-action
<RadicalEdward2> What time does the streaming start of the show?
<Baka-Neku> depends on where ypu live
<Baka-Neku> you*
<RadicalEdward2> NJ
<Baka-Neku> NJ? XD?
<Rodman> *SPOILER ALERT*
<Rodman> The episode takes place in Equestria
<RadicalEdward2> i can't think of any pony puns for NJ lol
<RadicalEdward2> also just a note, the jersey shore is not what NJ is like lol
<RobotPinkie> New... Jockey...
<Baka-Neku> well i know that tomorrow at 3pm im gonna watch that episode (europe time)
<RobotPinkie> Though that wouldn't work with no humans. :P
<RadicalEdward2> thought what wouldn't work?
<Baka-Neku> humans? i thought there only was ponies here =D
<RadicalEdward2> by ponies you mean no bronies? u mad? lol
<RobotPinkie> Jockey is a horse racing athlete. I was making a terribad joke along the lines of "Fillydelphia"
<RadicalEdward2> I thought Fillydelphia was kinda clever :3
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, I was referring to my joke as terribad :P
<RobotPinkie> I love the puns on the show.
<RobotPinkie> I'm totally wearing my "Phillies" T-shirt when I go to my first meetup, just so I can joke about it.
<RadicalEdward2> oh. yeah it was eh. but i love the shows puns. but the title drop in sentences hurts sometimes
<RadicalEdward2> example: You're not getting the lesson 'my little ponies'
<RobotPinkie> Aw, I like the title drops, I think it's cute. :P
<RadicalEdward2> maybe im just a dumb colt like that
<RadicalEdward2> lol
<RobotPinkie> Haha, nah, to each his own.
<RobotPinkie> Just because people have different tastes doesn't mean either side is wrong for it. :P
<RadicalEdward2> you're right :3 well g2g. be back later. got to get to morning class. luckily i only have one class on fridays. im a college freshman
<RobotPinkie> Later, RadicalEdward2 :)
<RobotPinkie> I'm done with classes for the day, just need a nap before BMN
<RadicalEdward2> kk. we bye bye pinkie pie :D
<WhatPayne> Whoa. Hello everypony.
<WhatPayne> First time seeing this many people here this early...
<Dermathil> dayum, almost 50 and still this is the morning
<RobotPinkie> Ohay WhatPayne
<WhatPayne> Hello. And I know, right?
<Dermathil> yeah, WP
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, 12 hours left until BMN, more than a day left until S2 premiere
<WhatPayne> I get the feeling this BMN will break some records...
<Takuanuva> Nah, why would it?
<Dermathil> 25:30 'til S2 premiere
<Takuanuva> I mean
<WhatPayne> Could this be the BMN with over 300 Bronies?
<RobotPinkie> Hopefully it won't break any servers
<WhatPayne> Yeah, hopefully
<Takuanuva> it's not like it will be followed by an entirely new episode from the entirely new season...
<Takuanuva> ...
<Takuanuva> ...wait.
<Dermathil> I wouldn't be surprised if we get more than half a thousand viewers.
<WhatPayne> indeed
<RobotPinkie> It's not like there will be a full Season 1 marathon followed by the S2 premiere...
<Andrevus> I just hope i can stay alive until then
<RobotPinkie> Can't complain about Blade Runner either, really...
<Andrevus> it's 13:23 here
<WhatPayne> It's not like they already yesterday posted the "flier" of this weekend's events
<Dermathil> Someone will have to start the MAGNETO call in the Gala episode
<Dermathil> yeah that too RP
<Takuanuva> ...to be honest, I've never saw BR.
<Dermathil> 12 hours 'til Blade RUnner
<WhatPayne> Saw it once. Was pretty meh...
<Surprise> Into the gala metal things,into the gala have some magnets~
<Andrevus> XD
<RobotPinkie> Well it's not as good as the book
<WhatPayne> Nothing ever is
<RobotPinkie> but still very good, I thought
<Dermathil> Takuanuva, that movie is awesome. One of the best hard Sci-Fi movies.
<Andrevus> Must not forget the magnets
<WhatPayne> So RobotPinkie, how you doing?
<Takuanuva> I don't say it isn't good
<Dermathil> At the MAGNETO!!!
<RobotPinkie> The best sci-fi movie of course is Brazil :P
<Dermathil> RobotPinkie: Best Sci-Fi movie is 2001.
<WhatPayne> Ugh no it is not
<Dermathil> If only because of how great it was for the time it came out.
<RobotPinkie> Best sci-fi movie of course is Lost in Space, the 2000 or something remake
<Andrevus> You know what im looking forward to? Seeing the pre Gen4 MLP movie.I hope it's the same one as what ObscurusLupa reviewed on TGWTG
<WhatPayne> ^^
<RobotPinkie> And I'm doing alright, WhatPayne, how u?
<WhatPayne> Pretty fine actually. Just got depressed when I read todays news...
<Dermathil> Andrevus: did the movie he review have the Smooze?
<Andrevus> i think it had.And it's a she
<Dermathil> So it is the same movie.
<RobotPinkie> Also: Best sci-fi movie is Highlander 2
<Andrevus> Anyone plays "Osu!" ?
<RobotPinkie> What news, WhatPayne?
<WhatPayne> Best Sci-Fi movie is Robowar
<mib_6fc1rc> Nah, the best sci-fi movie is The Man Who Saves The World
<RobotPinkie> If I'm serious though, I think my favorite sci-fi is Forbidden Planet.
<WhatPayne> Um. Nothing particular in the news. Just that in the past six months or so the news have been filled with pending crash of the European Union.
<RobotPinkie> I realize it's not in the same class as 2001, but I enjoy it more.
<Andrevus> Takes freaking long enough
<RobotPinkie> I'm trying not to worry about the economy too much...
<WhatPayne> I'd like to read some different, happy news for change.
<RobotPinkie> Rainbow Dash always comes to save you right before you hit the ground.
<Dermathil> Still sticking to my 2001 as best movie. Why? Because it was the novelty of the thing. No sound in space, it has a feel of grandeur and majesty that most modern sci-fi movies don't have anymore.
<WhatPayne> Yeah. I mean there is nothing one can do from the bottom when it come to economy when even the people at the top cant always do something.
*Dermathil had Blade Runner as his Mane Movie pick. Now it has made space for Apocalypse Now.
<RobotPinkie> I agree, Dermathil, and it's probably in my top 10 movies of all time. I just have a very strong nostalgic attachment to Forbidden Planet :P
<EspyLacopa> http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2270/1963789531_f6942837d6_o.jpg <-- Now that's a clue bat.
<Hat> when does stream start
<Andrevus> Did you guys know Princess Luna likes to play Taiko? XD
<Dermathil> Hat, in 12 hours.
<RobotPinkie> That's Dokkuro-chan, isn't it?
<Hat> ty
<EspyLacopa> Magneto will be at the gala too?
<EspyLacopa> RobotPinkie: Yes.
<WhatPayne> Don't hate me but my favorite Sci-Fi movie is District 9.
<Dermathil> We hope, EspyLacopa
<RobotPinkie> It's been a while since I watched that.
<EspyLacopa> And her club, Excalibolg.
<Hat> my fav sci fi is Moon
<Dermathil> Nevr seen D9, WhatPayne.
<Dermathil> MOON!!!
<RobotPinkie> It was pretty damn funny, I think
<WhatPayne> Moon is my second best favorite
<Dermathil> It is in my top 10 sci-fi movies
<Andrevus> She's ranked #25 in my country as a top player
<Dermathil> Clint Mansell did such a great score for that movie.
<WhatPayne> District 9 divides people. Some absolutely hate it and some love it.
<RobotPinkie> I need to watch it
<RobotPinkie> I imagine I'll love it
<Dermathil> same
<WhatPayne> Which?
<Andrevus> Same goes with MLP:FiM some people (us) love it some people hate it
<WhatPayne> D9?
<RobotPinkie> Though I also imagine that the moon is made of cheese, so...
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, WhatPayne
<Hat> D9 changed a bit halfway through
<WhatPayne> Right. Word of advice. Don't go watching it expecting anything.
<RobotPinkie> I-ma-gi-naaaaa-tion
<Hat> i like the action though
<Dermathil> Someone has to put Moon as a B movie someday.
<WhatPayne> Keep open mind.
<RobotPinkie> I don't really expect anything, except that it has something to do with aliens. :P
<Andrevus> Oh god that movie.The Biology teacher warned us about that one
<WhatPayne> Moon as B movie?
<WhatPayne> That's the spirit RobotPinkie
<Hat> it had bad moonrover effects but they weren't terrible
<Dermathil> Well it had a small budget, and wasn'T very manestream, so it would fit B
<Hat> might even sneak luna in on a special directors cut
<WhatPayne> Only problem with moon was that the dust did not behave correctly in the vacuum
<WhatPayne> ...of the moon.
<RobotPinkie> So... Eraserhead would definitely be B-movie
<Hat> Source Code was good too, same director
<RobotPinkie> It's a cult classic, AND it had virtually zero budget
<WhatPayne> Starship troopers would probably be up there with my favorite Sci-Fi movies...
<Hat> omc
<RobotPinkie> Oh man, that comic on EqD...
<WhatPayne> And Aliens
<Hat> Starship Troopers seems like a movie MADE to be bad
<Dermathil> WhatPayne, you missed Starship Troopers back in June, then
<WhatPayne> No I did not.
<WhatPayne> I was here.
<Dermathil> you were there back then?
<Dermathil> Darn, I didn'T think you were around that early
<RobotPinkie> lol I love Starship Troopers
<WhatPayne> Yeah. I've been here since sometime may.
<RobotPinkie> I know it's over the top and silly, but that's the charm
<WhatPayne> Not 24-7 but for the BMN's
<WhatPayne> And don't sweat about it. You can't always remember everypony.
<WhatPayne> Oh and which comic RobotPinkie?
<RobotPinkie> The bug hunt one.
<Dermathil> dayum, means you've been around for as long as I have, WhatPayne.
<RobotPinkie> I guess it's an alternate theory to how S2 might start :P
<Dermathil> Few can say they have
<WhatPayne> I guess I have been :P
<Hat> its strange how they are airing part 1 twice consecutively
<WhatPayne> But it was sometime August when I started come here daily.
<Rodman> Quick question, will the stream start at the same time it always does, or will it start earlier due to the marathon
<Rodman> ?
<Dermathil> Same time as usual Rodman
*RobotPinkie meows at Luna
<WhatPayne> That comic makes no sense...
<Surprise> :o
<WhatPayne> LUNA!
<Luna> 07hello people :)
<Surprise> LUNAAAAAAAAAAAA
<Dermathil> ohai Luna
<Dermathil> gonna stream early today?
<RobotPinkie> What doesn't make sense? It's just like normal, except... uh.... with Derpy.... and Aliens reference...
<Suffuri> Hrmmm.... Anything streaming right now?
<Dermathil> I think not, Suffuri.
<WhatPayne> But it was so out of character.
<Dermathil> Unless Luna starts to show House MD and the IT Crowd this early in the day
<Suffuri> Anyone know if you can watch the stream on an iPad?
<Suffuri> Trying to test that out but can't without anything streaming.
<RobotPinkie> No show streams this week, I don't think
<WhatPayne> Say Luna. Will you start streaming House again next week?
*Hat struts
<WhatPayne> ...
<Luna> 07not sure yet, we will see :)
<WhatPayne> Oh okay. Thanks.
<Hat> why isn't bronystate an international TV channel by now?
<WhatPayne> Good question.
<WhatPayne> Mr.Hat
*Hat tips
<RobotPinkie> Alright, well I'm gonna get some sleep in now.
<WhatPayne> :D getting ready for tonight?
<RobotPinkie> Yup

<Hat> it might be possible to use a laptop's wireless link with a lecture room projector to broadcast this
<mib_x6bii5> well, its for my lounge. and some bronies and I wanna watch it together. Though I suppose I could plug my PC into the TV
<WhatPayne> Dammit. I accidentally cut off the power to my modem.
<Hat> i don't have a PS3 however you could test it in the pre-show
<WhatPayne> Who's doing the preshow?
<mib_x6bii5> yeah, a test would be great.
<mib_x6bii5> also, is the countdown accurate? Cos my viewing it'll be at 3pm GMT
<mib_x6bii5> or my GMT is +2
<Luna> 07The mobile stream will only be up for the Season 2 premier

<Surprise> best picture ever
<EspyLacopa> PonyChat.
<LupalFillyus> BPE indeed
<LupalFillyus> Content Warning A Disturbing Lack of G4 Ponies
<LupalFillyus> lololololol
<EspyLacopa> Watch out for the smooze!
<LupalFillyus> But there is a lottery drawn? what by who where etc
<riverhippo> PonyChat is the name of the room, but its not the name of the server, is it?
<riverhippo> I'm trying to open this chat using Mirc, and I'm a bit of a noob
<EspyLacopa> riverhippo: The IRC server is irc.PonyChat.net.
<EspyLacopa> The room is #BronyState
<riverhippo> so i need to search for it manually?
<BoomerGunship> Hi there fellow bronies. Mind helping me out, how long till the first show starts? Or what time does the show start for +8 GMT?
<EspyLacopa> ...search for it?
<amahran> uuuuuuuuh
<amahran> Hi guys?
<EspyLacopa> Just type it in for a new server. irc.ponychat.net
<EspyLacopa> Heck, if you're already on mIRC, connected to another server, just type in: /newserver irc.ponychat.net
<Hat> http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6961/poniesponieseverywheres.jpg
<amahran> so.....
<amahran> ...hi?
<Hat> hi!
<LupalFillyus> @boomer, what exactly do you want to know the start of?
<EspyLacopa> YAR!
<LupalFillyus> there will be two movies, then the whole of season one, and then s2e1
<amahran> ...so, ummmm......
<BoomerGunship> Blade Runner

<EspyLacopa> About what?
<amahran> In this chat?
<LupalFillyus> 8AM then
<LupalFillyus> no wait
<LupalFillyus> i can do this
<EspyLacopa> We talk about ponies in this chat.
<wingless> Twilight Sparkle is best pony.
<LupalFillyus> 5AM
<EspyLacopa> And Season 2 Spoilers = hit with ban hammer.
<LupalFillyus> that's it
<amahran> ah
<riverhippo> "it said 'newserver' is an unknown command
<amahran> so...
<amahran> when's season 2 again?
<MalaysianBronySiv> how aboooooooooooooout.."Hay guys what's going on in this chat box?"

<Hat> twilight and luna are best ponies
<MalaysianBronySiv> LOL
<amahran> 8 GMT, okay then...
<amahran> and it will be streamed here, right?
<EspyLacopa> riverhippo: I'm not familiar enough with the commands on mIRC.
<LupalFillyus> the actual s2e1 you mean? thats 1400 GMT
<EspyLacopa> Do a google search for mIRC slash commands.
<riverhippo> i thought the commans would all be the saem for every IRC client
<EspyLacopa> LupalFillyus: Check the link in the channel topic. 1300 GMT.
<prince-dari> MFW riverhippo
<prince-dari> Ohai

<LupalFillyus> @espy "sat 14:00"
<LupalFillyus> in london
<LupalFillyus> 1400 GMT
<AstroTrain> My body is ready.
<riverhippo> MFW?
<prince-dari> My Face When
<riverhippo> hey dari, facny seein you
<prince-dari> Just me or SF dead again?
<riverhippo> well, it didnt help that it was out of commission for about a week
<riverhippo> it has just been neglected by the admin
<prince-dari> I mean I can't load up the site, would have told SR, but I don't think he's on.
<prince-dari> Just AFK
<riverhippo> I may be looking for a Skylanders forum, when one one eventually is created
<riverhippo> suprised there hasnt been on yet. I havent found one though
<prince-dari> Ah, so I take it you're anticipating it then?
<prince-dari> I'm pretty disappointed by it.
<riverhippo> I'll be buying the game, yes
<NewDCD> 9hey dari
<prince-dari> Yeah DCD?
<NewDCD> 9...what's SF?
<riverhippo> I dont know why anyone would be dissapoint... its just a game
<Mauran> 1 minute and 24 hours to go
<prince-dari> It's a forum.
<MalaysianBronySiv> THE GAME
<riverhippo> if a pony game was made for console, people would eat it up, no matter how bad it is, lol
<Mauran> 24 hours to go
<BoomerGunship> Skylander as in the Spyro game?
<riverhippo> yes
<riverhippo> he negative response to it is sickening to me
<prince-dari> I'm disappointed because it feels as though my favourite childhood game is being shat on again and again.
<BoomerGunship> Cool. I've played the Legends trilogy, that was nice.
<Luna> 07Just curious
<riverhippo> people need to get a life if they can spend that much time on the internet complaining about a game that isnt even out yet
<Luna> 07How many Euo-ponies are online atm?
<Luna> 07euro*
<Takuanuva> I am!
<prince-dari> ^
<Mauran> Night everypony, its 1 AM for me
<BoomerGunship> The new one, errr, I've expected it to be better. But its Spyro, so what the heck. I still love him!
<Luna> 07Night Mauran
<riverhippo> prince, that seems to be everyone's assessment
<riverhippo> and i can understand that
<riverhippo> but yall need to get over it, lol
<BoomerGunship> Look at the bright side though, an official Spyro figurine
<riverhippo> today's video game market is always gonna go towards the next generation, not the people who 'remember the old games'
<prince-dari> I'm not gunna bash people for liking it, but I'm fed up of people calling me a 'hater', saying 'you're not a true Spyro fan' and other bullshit like that just because I don't like the look of this new game.
<riverhippo> no, i dont buy into that either
<riverhippo> if you dont like it, you dont like it
<riverhippo> just stop complaining about it, lol
<LupalFillyus> mr hat is gona already
<LupalFillyus> damn
<Barry> Hello
<riverhippo> not talking to you, just in general
<prince-dari> Yeah, I understand.
<Barry> Well, only 23 hours and 58 minutes until Season 2
<riverhippo> i remmeber when i played the originals when they came out. Most of the joy was built into the anticipation of playing them, not the game itself
<riverhippo> so it doesnt suprise me too much that Spyro fans tend to judge the game before playing it
<Barry> That post has a Majora's Mask theme
<Barry> The EqD post
<prince-dari> MFW EQD broke my script somehow.
<Barry> lol
<prince-dari> Nothing's gone wrong with it for weeks.
<prince-dari> Now suddenly this.
<prince-dari> <_<
<Barry> *shrugs*
<EspyLacopa> lol
<riverhippo> hmm...
<NewDCD> 9dari, what script?
<prince-dari> I'd rather they either just left Spyro alone, or gave us HD versions of the first 3 riverhippo.
<prince-dari> My EQD script.
<riverhippo> i loved my childhood memeories, and I can always go back to them thanks to youtube and nes emulators
<NewDCD> 9ah
<NewDCD> 9I was worried for a second there
<riverhippo> but as far as the rest of my entertainment, I always willing to try new things
<AllisZero> Whyyyy, invalid passwordddd
<prince-dari> Neh
<prince-dari> Meh*
<riverhippo> which is entirely how i became a brony
<Barry> You could also use the Wii Virtual Console
<Barry> I think
<riverhippo> Wii? I'd rather not, lol
<riverhippo> jus curious, prince. you mind telling me how old you are?
<prince-dari> I watched MLP because Aicebo said it was good.
<riverhippo> Aicebo said that? lol
<EspyLacopa> My Little Alicorn: return of the Alfalfa Monster!
<prince-dari> I trust her opinion enough that I was willing to give it a change without any preconceptions.
<riverhippo> that's important
<prince-dari> I'm 16, birthday's July 6th.
<riverhippo> too many people click links wit the prenotioin that its a stupid cartoon
<NewDCD> 9he's 16, and also a genius when it comes to coding
<riverhippo> ah, see im 25, and I blame the Skyander's fued on the fact that older fans seem to be able to pass changes better because they've already seen their childhood stufs smashed to pieces arleady
<riverhippo> so they can deal with it better, lol
<riverhippo> speaking of which, I still cant figure out how to get here using mirc
<prince-dari> Stormy dislikes Skylanders too.
<riverhippo> I find no server called ponychat
<prince-dari> With mIRC just type /server irc.ponychat.net
<the> 0because its not on mirc by default.
<prince-dari> In the text box
<prince-dari> Then /join #bronystate
<riverhippo> ok, i tried newserver command cuz someone told me it would work
<DerpDeDerps> Thus I Came
<Pontang> Or type /server irc.ponychat.net -j #bronystate
<NewDCD> 9hey guys I think I'll stream some bootfighter once this download of mine is done
<the> 0thats what she said. :|
<EspyLacopa> To be fair, I haven't used mIRC in ages.
<DerpDeDerps> Indeed
<Barry> I think Spyro was a game that was doomed to failure as soon as its original developers no longer wanted it.
<the> 0most of the time id refrain from stupid childish jokes like that. (if you can even call it a joke) but right now im too bored to care.
<riverhippo> hazah!
<riverhippo> true Barry
<the> 0i believe the line is Huzzah!
<DerpDeDerps> 11Well its 1114pm here so I'm Tired as ever
<riverhippo> the problem liesw with people having a problem with future developers trying to push Spyro in the ground
<Luna> 07Get some sleep DerpDeDerps
<riverhippo> and while the later games arent as good, I dont like to throw the baby out with the bathwater
<riverhippo> the LoS was 'that' bad
<prince-dari> Insomniac didn't dump Spyro.
<prince-dari> They never owned it.
<riverhippo> i know
<DerpDeDerps> 15I mustn't For the Ponies.
<prince-dari> That was aimed at Barry.
<riverhippo> but they stopped making their game
<MeteorVenture> has this spyro discussion been really going on for around 12 hours?
<prince-dari> ...No?
<amahran> sorry guys, I'm back...
<DerpDeDerps> Okay now is my Colours o?
<DerpDeDerps> *Off
<the> 0just about every game nowadays is mind numbing. no thinking, no skill, just run into the wall till it gives way.
<riverhippo> unfortnautely, the Spyro fandom is at it's all time lowest morale. I'm hoping Skylanders is a good enough game for people to enjoy him again
<MeteorVenture> i left with people talking about it i think.. then i come back to people talking about it
<the> 0and thats what bothers me.
<riverhippo> sorry, its just two of us talking purple dragons, lol
<DerpDeDerps> Purples Dragons are Best Dragons
<MeteorVenture> "can't sleep.. talking about spyro"
<Barry> Hopefully, Skyward Sword will be the diamond in the rough of gaming
<DerpDeDerps> We can hope.
<the> 0then again even the games i heard were "hard" were still not much of a problem.
<Barry> Like what?
<the> 0anypony ever play the megaman zero games?
<Barry> Nope
<the> 0ever play megaman x?
<riverhippo> i never played megaman games
<DerpDeDerps> Does a Mustered count?
<the> 0no, mustered does not count.
<DerpDeDerps> I now see that I quoted that Wrong :P
<the> 0its hard to give a good example for what megaman x/zero games play like.
<Barry> I think you meant the condiment mustard.
<DerpDeDerps> They I do Believe so
<DerpDeDerps> *I Believe so
<DerpDeDerps> Damn it lack of Sleep You Win Again!
<Barry> yep
<Barry> it always does
<Luna> 07Poor thing
<Barry> Hi Luna!!
<Luna> 07Hello Barry
<Dermathil> >mfw Cereal Velocity posted something called "Dawn of The Final Day"
<DerpDeDerps> Saw that :P
<the> 0i cant think of any games that were hard besides i wanna be the guy.
<Dermathil> the: Wasn't demons souls hard?
<DerpDeDerps> "In 24 Hours that Moon will Screw us over"
<the> 0never played it. i dont think i even have the platform for that
<Dermathil> me neither, but I heard it was very hard
<riverhippo> what if they've been playing us this whole time with spoilers and junk
<riverhippo> and it turns out they air a rerun
<DerpDeDerps> ?
<riverhippo> Hub be trollin
<Dermathil> nah, impossible.
<DerpDeDerps> Them Hubs they done lied to us!
<riverhippo> ok ok, not possible
<Dermathil> Can't speak about it here though.
<DerpDeDerps> Or They exploded.... TWICE
<Dermathil> spoilers are insta-permaban here.
<DerpDeDerps> Right so
<prince-dari> Dem red kites be flyin' over my house.
<riverhippo> anyway, it seems like they arent gonna continue with episode 3 after this. I guess they wont air episode 3 until late October
<the> 0i think the word for that is a reploding.
<DerpDeDerps> Damn Dirty Red Kites!!!
<prince-dari> But red kites are cool. :<
<prince-dari> INB4 people thinking I actually mean a red coloured kite.
<DerpDeDerps> They Kill my whole family....
<DerpDeDerps> *Killed
<the> 0most games i find to be pretty lame by design. like pokemon. now, i know alot of ponies like it.
<the> 0but the way i base a game is how well they let skill give you the win over how long you have been playing.
<DerpDeDerps> Pokemon has some rather odd ones....
<riverhippo> squirtle squirtle
<prince-dari> Pokemon blue, you can't knock it.
<the> 0monster level 50 vs your level 20? sorry, but no matter how good you are. you have no way to possibly win.
<prince-dari> :P
<AllisZero> Aw god damn it
<DerpDeDerps> Like a Washing machine....
<the> 0that seems lame to me.
<prince-dari> the: Lawl, a level 20 can easily kill a lvl 50
<prince-dari> A lvl 20 can easily kill a lvl 100.
<DerpDeDerps> FlameTard GO!
<riverhippo> my lvl 10 Spyro could kill anypony
<the> 0but games that say, you have no upgrades? well, i guess you COULD win on this huge monster....but only if you have some real skill to fight back with.
<prince-dari> LOL riverhippo
<DerpDeDerps> Take it Easy son now!
<riverhippo> i wish they had pony characters in Skylanders. that would be schweet
<prince-dari> the: Pokemon is more about tactic than realtime 'skill'
<prince-dari> Different kind of games bro.
<the> 0i feel that skill should take priority over level.
<the> 0pokemon isnt really tactics.
<prince-dari> Well, you only need tactics if you play pokemon competitively I suppose.
<prince-dari> And it is.
<the> 0its a strategy game
<prince-dari> >tactic
<riverhippo> i never liked Pokemon, honestly
<prince-dari> >strategy
<prince-dari> Same thing.
<the> 0no. no they are not.
<prince-dari> I disagree.
<prince-dari> :P
<the> 0strategy is where you plan out the fight, i send this move out, do x dmg, take y dmg finish it with o
<the> 0they send out monster 2 use attack does x dmg and my monster one will likely die.
<DerpDeDerps> I've always wondered,How they can talk perfectly Fine while in the Sea...
<the> 0a tactic is something you can adapt and change at any time.
<the> 0they are very good swimmers.
<DerpDeDerps> Well played...Well Played indeed...
<the> 0strong enough swimmers to fight off the pokemon in the water with them
<prince-dari> Yeah, pokemon you can plan in advance, but there's realtime changes as well.
<DerpDeDerps> Indeed
<Takuanuva> 8okay...how much time do we exactly have before the stream starts?
<prince-dari> Bai
<Kitter> lol
<DerpDeDerps> Silly Person Colors are For Mods!
<prince-dari> 24 hours remain.
<prince-dari> Interesting.
<Luna> 07Wrong
<Luna> 0723:28 :P
<prince-dari> Well EQD got it wrong.

<DerpDeDerps> Dat Moon Will Screw us over soon...
<riverhippo> "one more day until social life ends" lol
<amahran> wellll.............
<amahran> Hello?
<riverhippo> how is that wrong?
<the> 0the moon never stopped me.
<amahran> How much more time left?
<the> 0i didnt like the moon time limit. so i glitch the game
<riverhippo> 23 and a half
<Luna> 07ticktockticktock
<DerpDeDerps> No in the Video :P
<the> 0i let the moon hit, but was out of sync for the milisecond of impact cutscene.
<amahran> ah

<Dermathil> She banishes to the moon, not luna.
<RobotPinkie> Sunstroke Star, the evil mare in the Sun.

<EspyLacopa> Super Robot Wars Z2
<mib_s7vje4> do area attacks exist in this game?
<NewDCD> 9yeah, they do
<NewDCD> 9frankly they're not too practical most of the time
<Dermathil> Dai-Guard time?
<NewDCD> 9"Gundam and Ganmen...Why so much Gan Gun Gan?!"
<wackyteen> =| No 7 a.m. post on ED.
<mib_mit1lu> soon...
<Dermathil> Gan means face in jap
<EspyLacopa> It's Popo's mech!
<Dermathil> so yeah
<NewDCD> 9"Help meeeeeeeeeeee!!"
<Pontang> I think Gundam was originally supposed to be Gundom (Gun Freedom or something). Essentially, it's supposed to be 'cool' since it's directed towards children (Year, I wonder how the hell that worked with Zeta Gundam anyway...)
<Dermathil> LUNA
<NewDCD> 9Luna! Prepare the Sol Graviton Crusher Punch!
<SilkAMV> damn that robot is fabulous
<NewDCD> 9naw it was always meant to be Gundam
<NewDCD> 9because a Gun with the stopping power of a Dam
<Pontang> They changed it to dam. =3
<EspyLacopa> But is it piloted by the FAAAbulous Ginga Bishounen?
*Tovler quits his no-pony fast early
<Dermathil> dat jetpack
<Pontang> The Yatate team combined the English word "gun" with the last syllable of the word "freedom" to form the name Gundom.
*the 0doesn't like some of the rules for the server, but sees why they are there.
<EspyLacopa> Bunny-mech, go!
*Dermathil notices that the had to manually click on the white color.
<NewDCD> 9Bunny? More like Dreadlocks
<Dermathil> (due to the /me not being reddis)
<Pontang> uwaaaaaaaa
<Dermathil> *reddish
<Dermathil> where is Dai-Guard?
<Dermathil> he didn't attack?
<the> 0wait, if i use a /me command i need to edit the color? XP
<NewDCD> 9Rainbow Dash would totally pilot this
<Dermathil> nah
<NewDCD> 9becaus the Brasta is so fast ;W;
*EspyLacopa certainly doesn't.
<Dermathil> indeed, NewDCD
<NewDCD> 9and the Spigot, it is a Rainboom
<Happy-Kah> dodge
<Dermathil> the: nah, it just suggests that you tried another color but had to change back
<NewDCD> 9ohai Ledouche
<the> 0oh wow, this is lame. its been 4 hours in game with my sign up saying im joining a MLP FiM guild and i have gotten no replies yet :|
<Dermathil> Lelouch?
<Pontang> Well, atleast Code Geass had Flow.

<EspyLacopa> Hm? Which game?
<Clarent> i just hopped on
<Pontang> Dat Colors

<the> 0maplestory. the game with the worst moderators ever
<Happy-Kah> it's not his day
<Clarent> i didnt know a game for this was out
<RobotPinkie> Flower was awesome
<Pontang> Lelouche's seiyuu is actually pretty good. I remember him and Kallen's seiyuu in Ookami to Koushinryou (Spice and Wolf).
<the> 0its basicly the worst run game ever.
<Pinkie_Pie2> why does it say rainbow dash is the best pony when she is certanly not :)
<NewDCD> 9Crowe Broust says: "Ammo conservation? What's that?"
<EspyLacopa> I really liked the opening and ending songs for the first season of Spice and Wolf
<EspyLacopa> mmm, apples
<Happy-Kah> wow, he really went to town on that guy
<RobotPinkie> Clearly Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<Pinkie_Pie2> yes
<RobotPinkie> :P
<SilkAMV> It's time somthing was made there
<the> 0rainbow is the best pony
<Happy-Kah> apple jack is my fav
<RobotPinkie> I love all the Mane 6 so much, though
<NewDCD> 9"CHECK!"
<SilkAMV> There is a difference between "favorite pony" and "best" pony'
<Pinkie_Pie2> pfft how can flying beat teleporting and destorting reallity?
<the> 0hey, can you keep a secret?
<Pontang> Lol, I don't even know why Lelouch is in this. He can't pilot. =s
<EspyLacopa> http://images.4chan.org/a/src/1316181841297.png <-- *snerk*
<SilkAMV> Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy are my favorite ponies
<NewDCD> 9Pon, C.C. does all of the pilotan I think
<Clarent> my favourtie are pinkie and rainbow
<Pontang> Yeah
<NewDCD> 9but Lelouch is actually decent, just not an ACE
<Pinkie_Pie2> same, but pinkie is "best"
<SilkAMV> but Rarity is indisputably best pony
<NewDCD> 9also his "Tactical Command" Menu is BOSS
<Pontang> But he shouldn't be in there.
<Pontang> Meh
<the> 0dont tell anypony, but the secret is *whispers* i have a crush on rainbowdash *endwhisper*
<Rodman> No way, Rainbow is best pony
<NewDCD> 9Kallen, Burai, Jewgi, Tanuki and Todoh are pilots as well
<Pinkie_Pie2> never!
<RobotPinkie> Pretty sure people are just kidding when they say "best pony"
<Clarent> *GAAAAAAASSP*
<NewDCD> 9oh also Spinzaku, but he joins you only for a short while
<RobotPinkie> I don't think anyone mean "objectively best"
<the> 0Shhhh!
<Rodman> Every pony is best pony
<Dermathil> SNIPING TIME
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9this game:
<Pontang> Lohengramm >>>>>>>> Lelouch
<Clarent> BOOM HEADSHOT

<Clarent> there we go
<Rodman> Now you hit him
<Clarent> HEADSHOT
<Clarent> in the body
<EspyLacopa> Whoa, that's long range
<Pontang> Actually, Yang Wenri >>>> Lelouch
<Pontang> ;x
<EspyLacopa> Aquarion special thingie?
<RobotPinkie> People just mean "omfg Rainbow Dash is so awesome," but with a slighty edge of prince-dari style argy-bargy :P
<Rodman> PUNCH HIM TO THE MOON!
<NewDCD> 9man I should watch Legend of the Galactic Heroes
<NewDCD> 9but it's so long
<Pontang> NewDCD: it's amazing. :D
<SilkAMV> Rarity, works the harderst, she the most mature, and the most creative. She is the only one of the ponies to have created and run her own business.
<Pontang> Yang Wenri is my favorite character evar.
<Rodman> NwDCD, my exact problem with One Piece
*prince-dari is the devil's advocate
<prince-dari> :>
<Clarent> applejack maybe didnt create it but she works very hard
<Happy-Kah> wow you are just kicking so much ermmmm butt
<RobotPinkie> Dash is the devil? :O
<RobotPinkie> omg
<NewDCD> 9enemies fighting enemies
<NewDCD> 9cool
<SilkAMV> She works hardest during harvest. Rarity works that hard all year round.
<Happy-Kah> lol, the skull thing looks soooo cool
<NewDCD> 9man those Ganmen are FUCKED
<RobotPinkie> Well, I'm pretty sure Fluttershy's "job" is taking care of all the animals.
<EspyLacopa> And Rarity sings
<the> 0rainbowdash needs more solos.
<Clarent> pinkie sings
<Pontang> Essentially, LOGH was probably an inspiration to the likes of Death Note/Code Geass.
<Happy-Kah> nope, fluttershy is just a lazy loner
<SilkAMV> Not to mention Rarity's biggest fan is a GODDAMN DRAGON
<Clarent> true, rainbow's solo at the gala was awesome
<wackypony> a baby dragon
<EspyLacopa> And she rescued herself when she got kidnapped.
<SilkAMV> A GODDAMN BABY DRAGON
<Dermathil> >mfw chat turned white and blue for the first time for me
<Clarent> well pinkie was a pet alligator
<wackypony> through being a bitch...
<Clarent> he has no teeth:3
<RobotPinkie> Pfft, Fluttershy has a full grown dragon wrapped around her finger, SilkAMV :P
<wackypony> pinkie WAS?
<wackypony> wait..
<Clarent> wait
<Clarent> sorry
<EspyLacopa> It's Pinkie Pie.
<Clarent> but who knows, maybe she was
<Barry> You never know with that party pony
<SilkAMV> Before or after she made equestria?
<Clarent> i mean she did create Equestria just by looking at a rainbow and having a party
<Pinkie_Pie2> pinkie can distort reallity
<Barry> lol
<EspyLacopa> Silk: Both.
<Barry> After, I think
<Stonegaze> What the heck are we looking at?
<EspyLacopa> That's just how Pinkie Pie rolls
<Rodman> I'll go play some TF2 to pass time
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie Pie invented parties.
<Rodman> See you guys later
<Dermathil> Stonegaze: SRW Z2
<Barry> Indeed
<wackypony> didn't SilkAMV work on ANthology?
<RobotPinkie> She's just that awesome.
<Barry> See ya, Rodman
<Clarent> pinkie pie einvented everything... including celestia
<SilkAMV> Yus, that is me
<Dermathil> O____O
<Stonegaze> @Dermathil The-what-now?
<NewDCD> 9Pinkie Pie built Mazinger Z
<EspyLacopa> Who invented who first, Celestia or Pinkie Pie?
<wackypony> did you spoil season 2 for yourself? just curious, i won't
<Dermathil> Stonegaze: Super Robot Wars Z2. A massive game that is a crossover of all the robot animes
<Pontang> Pinkie Pie no yuutsu. ;x
<Clarent> i did... i couldnt control myself around season 2 content
<Stonegaze> Dermathil Ah, okay thanks.
<Happy-Kah> this gmae is getting intence
<Dermathil_> yay back to black
<RobotPinkie> Oh, you're the one who did the Pink Pony section, right?
<Barry> Pinkie Pie is a dimension-distorting, reality-shifting party pony
<Dermathil_> alright guys, I'm leaving in about 10 minutes for class.
<wackypony> i had season 2 spoiled for me though thumbnails
<SilkAMV> It was unavoidable. I would have had to breaky myself away from the whole ponynet to avoid spoilers. It was a question of which would kill my soul worse. Spoilers, or avoiding ponies.
<wackypony> >=(
<NewDCD> 9ALL OF THE FUCKING ANIMATION BUDGET
<NewDCD> 9RIGHT HERE
<Pontang> Oh Amuro,. I no like you.
<wackypony> AVOIDING PONIES
<Tovler> I was going to wait until tonight to stop looking at ponies but I woke up too early today.
<wackypony> impossible
<Pontang> Kamille > Uso > Jadau > Amuro
<the> 0iv basicly stopped watching anything pony related as well
<Pinkie_Pie2> i didnt see a single spoiler! *proudface*
<RobotPinkie> I've gotten some very slight spoilers, but yeah, I'm NOT avoiding ponies.
<Pontang> =I
<Dermathil_> You sure, NewDCD? I am pretty sure that Gurren Lagann's combo took a big chunk of the animation budget too.
<the> 0to avoid s2 spoilers
<Stonegaze> Holy crap that was awesome!
<RobotPinkie> Avoiding ponies is worse than death
<wackypony> somebody spoiled Discord for me cause i linked him AppleDash pic
<Pinkie_Pie2> ye
<NewDCD> 9Dermathil: it's a running joke on the SRW fan commmunity
<Pontang> Loran == Hayate
<Tovler> Only the overall premise for Episode 1-2 is spoiled for me.
<Pontang> =x
<Dermathil_> ooooooooh
<Dermathil_> hahahahaahah
<ShiraiKuroko> <infoserv>
<the> 0pm me that appledash pic :|
<ShiraiKuroko> <InfoServ>
<ShiraiKuroko> grrr
<Tovler> Knowing that Discord exists is a bigger spoiler than what he looks like.
<wackypony> it's the one out of last night's drawfriend
<Dermathil_> hey guys, don't forget that spoilers= insta-permaban here
<Pinkie_Pie2> why do u ppl like appledash?
<Pinkie_Pie2> thats f***ed up

<NewDCD> 9like the quality, buster?
<Stonegaze> Ah.
<Tovler> But only the creators of the show know about Season 2, so there's nothing to worry about.
<SilkAMV> People love de-angries
<wackypony> i've read 80+ lesbian ship fics
<FreezeFrame> I'm just a romantic.
<wackypony> yay
<NewDCD> 9Espy: not to my knowledge, but Giant Robot is
<wackypony> clarent, dear god...
<SilkAMV> Twixie's my preference.
<the> 0dash is shipped with everypony and everything.
<wackypony> i knows...
<FreezeFrame> Only ones I don't like incest ships
<Clarent> the nest big ship
<Dermathil_> GO DAI-GURREN
<Clarent> dash adn that one tree
<FreezeFrame> (And other problematic ones)

<FreezeFrame> There are people who ship AppleMac and Princest
<Dermathil_> GO DAI-GUARD
<Dermathil_> GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<wackypony> well.... i'm working on shipping Fluttershy and Bloomberg
<RobotPinkie> I don't really read shipping, unless it's peripheral or parody
<the> 0which tree? fluttershy?
<NewDCD> 9BA BA BA BAAAAAA
<Dermathil_> YES
<Tovler> Hopefully the mods will create a #tab where spoiler can be accidentally said.

<Stonegaze> Too much info!
<Dermathil_> BA BA BA BABABABABABABABBABA
<FreezeFrame> Tovler: You can make your own.
<FreezeFrame> Like #ponyspoilers
<SilkAMV> I'm a fan of everypony-mac personally
<FreezeFrame> I like Fluttermac
<Tovler> and talk to myself like a crazy person.
<wackypony> i don't like straight shipping. <.<
<wackypony> i dun know why
<NewDCD> 9BIG O!
<NewDCD> 9SHOW TIME!
<FreezeFrame> Not because I'm opposed to lesbian Fluttershy, but because they're just such a cute couple
<Dermathil_> BIG O TIME
<Clarent> because your a heterosexual guy
<Pinkie_Pie2> wtf is wrong with u ppl
<the> 0i read one where fluttershy groomed dash's wings.
<Pontang> Dat lip sync
<Pinkie_Pie2> pony porn?
<the> 0and made her POMF hard.
<wackypony> you're talking to someone who was a bisexual furry a year ago
<the> 0no, no sexytime.
<FreezeFrame> Pinkie_Pie2: Who said anything about porn?
<FreezeFrame> We're talking about shipping.
<the> 0just shipping
<Stonegaze> I don't read ship-fics. Well, I don't read fics that much but I did like The Night After.
<Pinkie_Pie2> still, pony lesbians?
<FreezeFrame> So?
<wackypony> yay
<Dermathil_> AWW YEAH GO CROWE
<NewDCD> 9My Little SRW: Teamwork is SPIRALPOWER
<Clarent> i dont like clop-fics
<the> 0i do :|
<Dermathil_> NewDCD: epic victory
<wackypony> i love clop-fics, i just don't clop
<FreezeFrame> 90% of the developed characters in the show are female.
<Pinkie_Pie2> wtf
<the> 0as long as it includes dash.
<FreezeFrame> Of course we'll have lesbian ships.
<wackypony> i clopped to ponies once, i was ready to kill myself
<SilkAMV> Closest thing I read to a ship was "Of Two Minds" where Twilight got stuck in Trixie's body.
<Pinkie_Pie2> sure we can have, but not like them
<the> 0dash is pretty.
<Pinkie_Pie2> thats just effed up
<SilkAMV> Was pretty interesting.
<wackypony> Dash is beautiful
<FreezeFrame> What's so wrong about that?
<Happy-Kah> is derpy hooves a he or she?
<FreezeFrame> She.
<wackypony> Pinkie, just go read lesbian ship fics.
*FreezeFrame prefers calling her Ditzy Doo or Bright Eyes.
<Pinkie_Pie2> no!
<Happy-Kah> i was gonna say man or woman, but she is neither
<wackypony> you might understand...
<Happy-Kah> lol
<Pinkie_Pie2> i like te cupcakes tho
<prince-dari> Eugh.
<prince-dari> I much prefer Derpy Hooves.
<Clarent> hey guys, just wondering, who has seen that picture of filly pie eating her tail?
<Dermathil_> how did we go from giant robots to shipping?
<SilkAMV> Yeah cupcakes entertained me.
<Dermathil_> This baffles me
<the> 0i liked the idea of cupcakes.
<SilkAMV> But it didn't ruin pinkie for me
<FreezeFrame> Derpy seems kinda mean for an actual name.
<Flutteryay> hello
<the> 0but i didnt like the idea of dash being in cupcakes.
<Dermathil_> oh god, who said one of the forbidden fics?
<Pinkie_Pie2> pinkie can be ruined :D
<Pinkie_Pie2> cant*
<wackypony> i've never read Cupcakes
<SilkAMV> Cupcakes is like a separate canon in my head that has nothing to do with real ponies.
<wackypony> never plan to
<Pinkie_Pie2> read it
<Stonegaze> I haven't read Cupcakes and I don't intend to in the near future.
<Pinkie_Pie2> its good
<the> 0"one" of the forbidden fics?
<NewDCD> 9BURESTO FAIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<the> 0there are others?
<Dermathil_> BREAST FIRE!!!!!!!!!!
<mib_3w0x1n> I will never read cupcakes
<FreezeFrame> For Grimdark horror, I prefered the one where Rarity went completely off the deep end.
<Pinkie_Pie2> read cupcakes, just dont make it mess up pinkie
<the> 0nightmare to remember?
<FreezeFrame> The one where she made the perfect stallion.
<EspyLacopa> Anyone ever eat schadenfraude pie?
<Dermathil_> OH SNAP
<Dermathil_> REINFORCEMENTS
<SilkAMV> Grimdark Rarity? Do want. Can has?
<Happy-Kah> was that guy who died an ant eater?
<Clarent> O NOES, more
<Rainbow-Dash> If you read cupcakes, you will lose any grain of sanity left in your soul
<FreezeFrame> SilkAMV: Let me find it again
<Stonegaze> Ooh man, shit just got real!
<Happy-Kah> i can't read any of this :'(
<Dermathil_> DAYUM
<Clarent> oh snap
<Happy-Kah> lololol
<Pinkie_Pie2> eyup
<Dermathil_> AWW SHEEEET
<Happy-Kah> it just steped up a notch
<Clarent> oh no
<MeteorVenture> i read cupcakes.. it was really not plausible so i really didn't get affected by it.. if you really think it's possible you probably have problems of your own.. just saying
<Dermathil_> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Clarent> NOOOOOOOOO
<Dermathil_> OOH SNAP
<wackypony> Rainbow-Dash, i laughed the offended page, will cupcakes affect me?
<Dermathil_> ONE OF THE FOUR GENERALS
<SilkAMV> Someone is drawing a comic of cupcakes. He's up to the part where Rainbow Dash wakes up.
<EspyLacopa> That's the general witht he flying fortress, right?
<Dermathil_> yes espylacopa
<NewDCD> 9FUCKING ASSIMILATIOOOOOOOOOOON

<Dermathil_> UPGRADE
<Dermathil_> AWW YEAH
<Dermathil_> ASSIMILATIONS
<NewDCD> 9GURREN LAGANN CAN FLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
<Rainbow-Dash> Dunno, it didnt affect me, but its still really.. Disturbing, if you think about the little details, that is.
<Clarent> wait... waht
<Dermathil_> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<FreezeFrame> Ah, yes. Prince Charming: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/05/story-prince-charming.html (Warning, this is one scary grimdark)
<Pinkie_Pie2> cupcakes is ok, maybe even good, but its not excelent
<Dermathil_> YES
<Clarent> i thought this was code
<Dermathil_> YES
<Dermathil_> YES
<Stonegaze> This scene will go down in history!
<Dermathil_> ULTRA COMBO
<MeteorVenture> ya i was smiling through it until about half-way.. then it was just kinda uncool
<RobotPinkie> The only disturbing thing about that fic was the grammar, at the time I read it.
<Clarent> WHAT GAME IS THIS?!?
<SilkAMV> sweet
<mib_3w0x1n> Who the hell do you think I am!!!???
<Dermathil_> Clarent: SUPER ROBOT WARS Z2
<Stonegaze> Clarent Super Robot Wars
<RobotPinkie> The grammar WAS atrocious, though, so... English majors beware
<Dermathil_> I said it like 10 times already
<wackypony> imma try to beat Halo by the time season 1 stream starts.
<EspyLacopa> http://whatever.scalzi.com/2006/09/26/how-to-make-a-schadenfreude-pie/ <-- Have some pie.

<NewDCD> 9but it still is one of the best series in the franchise
<FreezeFrame> DCD: You guys going to set +N soon?
<Pontang> The last 10 episodes felt like the last 10 episodes of Ideon.
<Pontang> It's probably my favorite non-Tomino Gundam series.
<Pontang> Of course, it's 1. Victory, 2. Zeta, 3. Turn-A

<Nyst> is that a sword crotch?
<EspyLacopa> The movies start today at 11 PM GMT, and the season 2 premiere airs at tomorrow at 1 PM GMT
<RobotPinkie> It's at 2PM in Ireland, Happy-Kah
<Baka-Neku> i know in my time season 2 starts at 3 pm tomorrow

<Luna> 07Baka-Neku where you from?
<Happy-Kah> oohhh that is awesome, thank you!
<NewDCD> 9HOLY SHIT THAT IS NEW
<Baka-Neku> denmark =D
<Marisa> Nyst: This is why Gurren Lagann has the best mechas.
<Luna> 07ah :)
<NewDCD> 9...well holy shit.
<Happy-Kah> i am in northern ireland but i am irish and british
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<Happy-Kah> i have both passports!
<Stonegaze> I am in Spain.
<FreezeFrame> Well, yeah. Each of the four nations that makes up the United Kingdom of Great Britain is quite autonomous.
<SilkAMV> It would be funny if they put the IGPX mechs in the game just to get their asses kicked
<Happy-Kah> i like to say i am irish tho,
<RobotPinkie> and that's why you shouldn't say GMT, Espy, because now he thinks it starts an hour before it does :P
<NewDCD> 9Code Gee!Ass!!: Lelouch of the Dodging.
<Baka-Neku> Stonegaze should't you have around the same time as me then?
<Stonegaze> Well I'm off for lunch. See you all at the movies.
<Stonegaze> I dunno
<FreezeFrame> Because people forget that Brit time only coincides with GMT when it's not Summer Time
<Marisa> ;p
<EspyLacopa> Bah, that's their problem.
<Stonegaze> Well, see you all!
<NewDCD> 9Time for FRIENDSHIP CANNON
<Baka-Neku> tomorrow gonna be loaded with people >_<
<crono_flash> Ohai everyone
<EspyLacopa> I say GMT, because it /is/ GMT.
<RobotPinkie> Well, not just their problem if everyone sees it that way...

<Baka-Neku> i never understod GMT talk xD
<Happy-Kah> neither have i
<Happy-Kah> lol
<RobotPinkie> GMT is also the name of a time zone, which is where the confusion lies.
<NewDCD> 9man, Simon
<NewDCD> 9hang in there
<EspyLacopa> If it's 5 PM GMT, and you're timezone is GMT-5, then it's 5-5 PM in your timezone, thus Noon.
<Baka-Neku> i know i live in -1 somthing somthing
<SilkAMV> Is that really a mech?
<Happy-Kah> i live at +0 gmt
<Happy-Kah> i think
<Happy-Kah> lol
<FreezeFrame> Gurren Laggan needs some healz
<NewDCD> 9it's an Invader from Getter Robo Armageddon
<EspyLacopa> What throws people off is the abomination that is Daylight Savings.
<NewDCD> 9it's kay
<NewDCD> 9I think Simon has the Guts seishin
<Baka-Neku> thought it looked like Getter Robo
<RobotPinkie> When you set up your computer, you set your time zone as GMT relative. DST is not taken into account.
<EspyLacopa> And you kinda have to keep Daylight Savings in mind. . .because there are large parts of the world that don't use it.
<RobotPinkie> Not going to say anything more about it, people see GMT as UK time
<RobotPinkie> even the half of the year that it isn't :P
<RobotPinkie> So who likes ponies?
<FreezeFrame> Actually, you set "automatically detect DST" as well
<Happy-Kah> dam i have no idea about any of this, and i live in the uk!
<Happy-Kah> lol

<FreezeFrame> RobotPinkie: No one in here.
<RobotPinkie> Aw, I'm alone? :(
<FreezeFrame> :P
<Baka-Neku> only reason i know it's 3pm for me is i calculated the time on the countdown =D
<EspyLacopa> I thought it was a given, since we're all here.
<RobotPinkie> and yes, you do, FreezeFrame. :P
<the> 0can i request a vid to be streamed?
<NewDCD> 9pretty cool, thank ya kindly
<FreezeFrame> Yes, I was being sarcastic
<NewDCD> 9King Gainer vs. the World
<RobotPinkie> Well I meant you set "automatically set to DST" :P
<SilkAMV> GURREN HAX
<RobotPinkie> Whether or not you like ponies, FreezeFrame, that I cannot say!
<NewDCD> 9time for your favorite attack
<gentlecolt> Hi.
<EspyLacopa> Giga Drill Breaker!
<gentlecolt> i think some of you saw my thread on ponychan
<gentlecolt> about the surgery
<gentlecolt> well
<gentlecolt> it went through perfectly
*EspyLacopa did not, for he does not go to ponychan.
<AllisZero> Morning everypony
<EspyLacopa> Dancouga did something fancy!
<Turgle> Hi AllisZero
<RobotPinkie> morning, AllisZero
<NewDCD> 9I haven't seen the thread
<NewDCD> 9but I'm glad your medical care is going along smoothly, as a future medical professional myself
<the> 0this is awesome http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIfHKfyRO5Y
<Turgle> OMG 22h to S2 ><
<EspyLacopa> Dude, 12 more damage and you could have killed that unit.
<FreezeFrame> Rarity is my favorite pony
<FreezeFrame> And my favorite ship is Rarijack
<gentlecolt> i recovered in 10. seconds. flat. (Just exxagerating. it took about a minute to fully recover.)
<EspyLacopa> Q is my favorite pony?
<NewDCD> 9CHIRICO MANEUVERS
<Tovler> Damn, I suck at old school games.
<RobotPinkie> My favorite ship is Twilestishy Diane Cake, still
<NewDCD> 9notasinglefuck.VOTOMS
<EspyLacopa> The cake is a lie, RobotPinkie.
<gentlecolt> ADVENTURE TIME
<SilkAMV> Lol I thought he did that to the 12 damage robot
<Baka-Neku> No the cake is ALIVE!
<WhatPayne> phew. Just read the Lauren Faust interview.
<RobotPinkie> The cake is a DELICIOUS truth, if you've watched through the end credits, EspyLacopa!
<Turgle> the cake is a pie
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<FreezeFrame> Apparently, the new stream software stops if you go to a different tab?
<Baka-Neku> the cake is pinky pie
<Happy-Kah> lolol nice!
<FreezeFrame> Or it was just a coincidence
<Turgle> i think coincidence
<RobotPinkie> Soarin' x Pie is best ship
<EspyLacopa> lol
<Turgle> mine works fine
<EspyLacopa> Go Leeron.
<Happy-Kah> lol, there is a guy called the and his name keeps linking in the text
<Tovler> s***, I forgot that Archer aired last night.
<WhatPayne> Wait RobotPinkie aren't you supposed to be napping?
<SilkAMV> Twixie ship is best ship
<RobotPinkie> I did nap, WhatPayne
<NewDCD> 9Big O! Acccccccccccccction!

<SolsticeBrony888> AppleShy <3
<WhatPayne> Oh... Had good nap?
<RobotPinkie> 2 hours of sweet, sweet sleep... actually I had a nightmare, but that's beside the point :P
<the> 0cast in the way of my first, ye are dead.
<the> 0fist*
<the> 0did it have black snooty in it?
<EspyLacopa> Which was the series with the Goldion Hammer in it?
<NewDCD> 9GaoGaiGar
<WhatPayne> Well that's nice (not the nightmare part) but that you had good nap
<SilkAMV> You mean Hokey Smokes?
<Baka-Neku> lol for me The is invisible..... his tekst is white and i have white bagground
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I feel well rested.
<Happy-Kah> what does the 1m beside my name mean?
*the 0is a ninja
<EspyLacopa> 1 minute?
<RobotPinkie> It's idle time, Happy-Kah
<Happy-Kah> ooohhh, time since last post
<RobotPinkie> Yep
<NewDCD> 9time for some CONCENTRATED FRIENDSHIP ASSAULT
<Happy-Kah> ya, lol figured out after i typed
<NewDCD> 9SUDDENLY
<NewDCD> 9ELEMENTS OF HARMONY
<Happy-Kah> lololol
<Happy-Kah> lolol
<Rainbow-Dash> http://miburl.com/EKCWEN
<EspyLacopa> So, you're using 0colors like this?
<Happy-Kah> it is not that guy's day
<Solarboy> Holy crap, is this Z2?
<EspyLacopa> Yes
<NewDCD> 9yes, yes it is
<Solarboy> Wow, the robots look much better now.
<Solarboy> I hadn't noticed that lol
<Happy-Kah> and now, i want pizza
<Solarboy> I just had pizza yesterday.
<Happy-Kah> sundenly, hunger
<Solarboy> But let's have a pizza party to commemorate Season 2.
<Happy-Kah> totally!
<gentlecolt> PIZZA DAAAAAAAAY!
<Justin> Just finished a large pizza, good stuff.
<RobotPinkie> I might have pizza tomorrow after S2 premiere
<gentlecolt> fffffffffffffffrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt.
<Happy-Kah> lolol
<Happy-Kah> i had a large pizza on tuesday,
<Happy-Kah> i couldn't eat it all in one go
<Happy-Kah> cold pizza <3
<Solarboy> Send someone to the moon :3
<Solarboy> Cold pizza is the best thing ever.
<crono_flash> NewDCD, are you up for some BlazBlue later?
<Justin> Pizza to commemorate Season 2? Hell, if this were a bar, drinks and food would be on me.
<Happy-Kah> take them off!
<NewDCD> 9DAT DYNAMIC KILL
<Happy-Kah> lol
<EspyLacopa> I remember one restaurant I went to, they had a spinach pizza using ricotta cheese instead of the standard mozzeralla and tomato sauce.
<EspyLacopa> It was delicious.
<RobotPinkie> What kind of veggies, SilkAMV?
<Happy-Kah> cool guys don't look, am i right?
<crono_flash> it sounds good
<SilkAMV> Olives tomatoes and peppers
<Sebiale> Isn't that Shinn? The whiny, partly sociopathic brat from Gundam Seed Destiny?
<SilkAMV> More veggies than cheese really
<Happy-Kah> tho there was a lack of slow motion
<SilkAMV> They really piled it on
<Happy-Kah> i don't like tomatoes but the other 2 are nice
<NewDCD> 9Yeah it's Shinn, only he's really cool in SRW
<RobotPinkie> Aw, those are GOOD veggies though
<NewDCD> 9kind of how Shinji is actually pretty badass in Alpha
<NewDCD> 9IT'S ALL ABOUT POSITIVE INFLUENCE FROM CHARACTERS OF OTHER SERIES
<SilkAMV> Yeah, but they're all up in my pizza. Doesn't even taste like pizza anymore.
<RobotPinkie> Aw, then it's not fun
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<EspyLacopa> YOu could do like Pinkie, and put candy corn on your pizza.
<Happy-Kah> lol, tastes like a tomatoe and cheese toasty with veg
<NewDCD> 9SRW was a massive rewrite of SEED Destiny
<Sebiale> I don't know what SRW or Alpha is. By Shinji do you mean SHinji Ikari?
<NewDCD> 9people actually called Kira and Assram on their bullshit, for one
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9SRW is a big series
<NewDCD> 9Super Robot Wars
<Solarboy> Yes, he meens shinji ikari
<NewDCD> 9this is the Z subseries
<Justin> Does anyone know when they will be airing season 2 live here EST? If nobody's sure, I have no problem leaving the room open the next day.
<NewDCD> 9there is also the Alpha subseries...yeah
<Solarboy> Filled with robots of every single mecha series.
<EspyLacopa> Super Robot Wars: Massive crossover between a massive number of Mech Anime.
<prince-dari> 9 AM EAST
<prince-dari> EST*
<Justin> Thanks you
<prince-dari> On Saturday 17th
<Sebiale> I can't keep all these different gundam continuities straight . . .
<RobotPinkie> I don't know if I can forgive Shinji for being such a pussy in Evangelion
<Solarboy> 23 HOURS LEFT.
<NewDCD> 9Shinji wasn't a pussy
<NewDCD> 9he was 14
<NewDCD> 9he was still a brat
<Pontang> RobotPinkie: Shinji is just like every other 80s mecha protagonist.
<Solarboy> Yeah
<Tovler> *22*
<NewDCD> 9can't blame him for being scared of piloting a giant robot
<Solarboy> He was a realistic character. Whether you like it or not.
<NewDCD> 9but in SRW
<Pontang> Evangelion is basically that, an 80s mecha made in the mid 90s.
<Luna> 0721:52 :)
<RobotPinkie> No, but there was 0 character development. Not realistic
<Tovler> Now I get it. The spoiler ban is for right after the show airs.
<Darkened35> Hey
<NewDCD> 9thanks to people like Kouji, Ryoma, Guy Shishiou....ect.
<Sebiale> I still need to watch the End of Evangelion and the Rebuild Series of Evangelion.
<NewDCD> 9Shinji actually had positive role models
<Pontang> Granted, it's Evangelion was nothing special as people like to claim.
<RobotPinkie> Everything happened all at once in the last episode, when it comes to character development. If you call that realistic, whoa boy.
<Happy-Kah> awww this reminds me of a song
<SilkAMV> Man, the Rebuild kicks ass
<NewDCD> 9and decided to reject Instrumentality and basically told Gendo to go fuck himself
<Solarboy> The rebuild series is actualy really good.
<Pontang> -it=s
<NewDCD> 9hell, Gendo ended up going SON I AM PROUD
<Solarboy> I gotta play alpha eventualy.
<NewDCD> 9one of the Alpha games is translated
<SilkAMV> Here's an AMV I made of it in two hours http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG2-XY6jYIM
<NewDCD> 9Alpha Gaiden for the PSX
<Sebiale> OMG, Lelouch and C2!
<Pontang> >_>;
<Solarboy> brb downloading.
<Sebiale> I love hiw Japanese voice actor
<Sebiale> his*
<Pontang> Sebiale: same
<Solarboy> Wait, isn't that the one with only bandai originals?
<RobotPinkie> and "like every other 80
<Pontang> But I loved in Spice and Wolf.
<Pontang> He also did Death the Kid.
<RobotPinkie> and "like every other 80's mecha protagonist", no
<Pontang> In Soul Eater.
<RobotPinkie> Just... no...
<Pontang> wait
<NewDCD> 9naw you're thinking of OG
<NewDCD> 9DAT BEAM CONFUSE
<Pontang> No, it's the guy who did Light.
<Sebiale> This battle seems pretty one-sided.
<Pontang> Lawl
<Pontang> Always get those two confused.
<NewDCD> 9I'm just that good
<NewDCD> 9Does this remind you of anything?
<NewDCD> 9RAINBOOM ATTACK
<SilkAMV> there is something very sexual about what just happened
<mib_g4xeru> i've got a question
<Sebiale> lol
<mib_g4xeru> why is this show worth watching?
<mib_g4xeru> i tried watching the first ep but it wasn't very good
<mib_g4xeru> does it get better?
<mib_g4xeru> im talking about mlp
<NewDCD> 9which one?
<mib_s7vje4> yes
<mib_s7vje4> it does
<mib_g4xeru> i mean a lot of people are obsessed about it
<Darkened35> Umm, can someone give me the time and timezone the first ep for S2 will air?
<NewDCD> 9well the first two eps aren't very indicative of the quality
<Pontang> Fukuyama Jun played Lawrence in Ookami to Koushinryou.
<EspyLacopa> 9 AM EDT (GMT-4)
<NewDCD> 9I'd recommend you to start with Ep 03 or 04
<SilkAMV> They did take a but to hit their stride
<Pontang> Tbh, I haven't heard him in anything else.
<SilkAMV> But the show makes me inexplicably happy doe some reason
<RobotPinkie> Yes, watch the first 6 episodes or so, mib_g4xeru
<mib_g4xeru> okay
<SilkAMV> for*
<mib_g4xeru> thanks for the tip
<Justin> Episode 4 did it for me, try that one
<NewDCD> 9and it's also not for everyone
<Darkened35> Thanks Espy :)
<NewDCD> 9even if it's liked by a lot of people
<NewDCD> 9it's okay if it isn't your taste
<Dorfflin> hi
<Solarboy> bEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAMU
<mib_g4xeru> are they free-standing?
<mib_g4xeru> or is there a big plot
<SilkAMV> Episode 5 was the one that made me realize I cared about the characters.
<EspyLacopa> And it's currently 11:14 AM EDT.
<mib_s7vje4> mostly freestanding
<gentlecolt> DAWN OF THE FINAL DAY
<Solarboy> Mostly yes.
<SilkAMV> Free-standing for the msot part
<gentlecolt> 24 HOURS REMAIN
<Justin> They're slightly intertwined
<RobotPinkie> They mostly stand on their own, yup
<NewDCD> 9SCOOTALOO F. SEIEI
<mib_s7vje4> there is some overarching plot, but it's not essential
<Sebiale> I never had a problem with ep 1/2. Not as good as the others yeah, but I never thought them bad.
<Sebiale> Oh look, Setsuna . . .
<mib_s7vje4> as long as you watch the first ep first, and last ep last, you're good
<Happy-Kah> lol, i can't find the video and we are completly off topic now
<Happy-Kah> lol
<RobotPinkie> Well, I love the first 2 episodes now...
<Happy-Kah> so bleh!
<NewDCD> 9yeah I like the first two eps too
<Darkened35> I swear it was 6 am in some timezones.
<Andrevus> My only problem with the whole season is not enough Luna
<SilkAMV> I remember not liking the first two episodes. But now that I'm into the show I love them.
<RobotPinkie> But it gets a lot better with more context
<NewDCD> 9but they are not a good starting point for everyone
<mib_g4xeru> i'll drink some beer and watch them
<mib_g4xeru> thanks and bye!
<Solarboy> The first 2 are great in my opinion, they are fun to watch.
<Darkened35> So it's EDT for sure?
<RobotPinkie> Exactly, SilkAMV
<Andrevus> 17:15 here :D
<dorfflinn> hallo
<Justin> Am I the only one who saw the animation error in episode 2 where it shows 6 elements of harmony on the pedestal on my first go?
<Happy-Kah> shinji
<EspyLacopa> Yes.
<Justin> That stood out like a sore thumb.
<SilkAMV> No, there was a video about all the errors
<SilkAMV> but I've seen plenty that the video didn't point out
<EspyLacopa> Some people just don't want to acknowledge the difference between GMT and BST.
<RobotPinkie> Me too, SilkAMV
<RobotPinkie> I didn't check the whole thing, though
<Darkened35> It's 4:15 pm in GMT though...
<Sebiale> I don't find errors because I don't look for them.
<RobotPinkie> but they missed my favorite mistake... the double nostril
<Darkened35> and apparently it's 11:15 EDT now
<EspyLacopa> Yes, yes it is.
<Happy-Kah> the first 2 eps were like totally serious and stuff and the rest were just like yay ponies!
<RobotPinkie> I don't look for mistakes, I just happen to notice them, lawl
<EspyLacopa> You /sure/ you're in GMT right now?
<SilkAMV> When you edit ponies they errors are hard not to notice
<EspyLacopa> Do you observe Daylight Savings where you are?
<EspyLacopa> Because GMT /never/ changes due to Daylight Savings.
<RobotPinkie> Seriously, Espy, the time zone is called GMT, their current time is BST :P
<NewDCD> 9there's an easy way to keep track of the time
<NewDCD> 9http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/eastern-time/
<NewDCD> 9when it's 9 AM there
<NewDCD> 9it's time for the ep
<dorfflinn> time zones screw me up, and I university theoretical maths >.>
<ZakuPony> I can't believe so many ponies are gathered here already...
<SilkAMV> I love having no class on friday :D
<NewDCD> 9>ZakuPony
<NewDCD> 9you are already my very best freeeeen
<Darkened35> OK!
<EspyLacopa> But BST is GMT+1.
<Darkened35> I shall set alarms :D
<ZakuPony> Friendship accepted
<dorfflinn> hmm.. anyone have the link to the pony countdown handy?
<RobotPinkie> http://ponycountdown.com/
<NewDCD> 9PONTANG
<NewDCD> 9EYES ON THE STREAM
<RobotPinkie> Easiest way to see
<NewDCD> 9IT'S TIME FOR SOME WAAAAAAAAAAAAAVERIDER CRASHAN
<RobotPinkie> I guess....
<dorfflinn> wow, i really should have seen that url coming
<AllisZero> Haro
<RobotPinkie> Haha, yeah it's pretty easy to remember once you see it
<NewDCD> 9okay I guess Kamille's ultimate attack in this game isn't a Waverider Crash
<RobotPinkie> I like the random Rarity being dragged across the screen, too...
<VioletVanilla> 6Here is a Philosoraptor trivia for everypony. . .
<VioletVanilla> 6Why is Octavia's cutie mark a Treble clef, when the Cello is a Bass clef instrument?
<EspyLacopa> Click on Celestia on RobotPinkie's link
<SilkAMV> Because she's pinkie's sister
<Solarboy> Because Mexico?
<RobotPinkie> omfg VioletVanilla
<Mug> Whose to say that equestrian cello's follow the same rules?
<mib_s7vje4> cello isn't her favored instrument
<Solarboy> Oh who the hell called himself "the"?
<RobotPinkie> You just blew my mind
<dorfflinn> Maybe she got her CM from a different instrument, but had to play the double-cello-bass for the gala?
<EspyLacopa> Click on Derpy
<Andrevus> lol Derpy
<EspyLacopa> lol, click on Twilight. . .
<EspyLacopa> Planck time. . .
<Andrevus> oh god and to think i thought she couldn't get any nerdier
<NewDCD> 9BYE BYE

<RobotPinkie> Click on the sun

<RobotPinkie> <3
<RobotPinkie> and then Luna links to some Luna inspired music.
<SilkAMV> How did that do less damage than Big O's goddamn punch?
<EspyLacopa> Yes, yes, I realize that it's a code. But what does the code /mean/?
<mib_s7vje4> let me check
<Andrevus> oh god click on the teacher Cherilee i think was it
<NewDCD> 9LET'S GO

<NewDCD> 9Amuro Ray ALWAYS FINISHES HIS ENEMIES IN STYLE
<Monkey_Zombie> Cause I really want to play this.
<NewDCD> 9there are for a few games in the series
<FlaschenJoe11> Don't think there are
<NewDCD> 9but this is the newest one so there isn't
<Solarboy> There are no translations yet for this one.
<EspyLacopa> I keep missing Rarity
<Monkey_Zombie> dang
<DrMechano> Hello, hello!
<Happy-Kah> can you translate all of it?
<RobotPinkie> or click Spitfire if you think it's taking too long for S2 to get here :P
<AllisZero> Haha
<NewDCD> 9I just know to navigate themenus
<EspyLacopa> lol
<SilkAMV> wait, who the hell is that pony in the back?
<NewDCD> 9because I learned with the games that have been fantranslated into English
<xSora> sup
<Happy-Kah> lol awesome
<EspyLacopa> ....
<Monkey_Zombie> neat
<EspyLacopa> I suddenly wonder what will happen when Spitfire's speedy countdown ends.
<Monkey_Zombie> does this include robotech?
<NewDCD> 9it has Macross Frontier units
<NewDCD> 9so Sorta
<Monkey_Zombie> sweet
<NewDCD> 9if you want Rick Hunter/Hikaru Ichijou
<xSora> suÃ¼
<NewDCD> 9get Alpha Gaiden for the PSX
<Seviper> I've never liked how all the gundam series always have the main mech have a similar design
<NewDCD> 9it's been fantranslated and included Macross DYRL
<Happy-Kah> this guy looks like the sleve of a brown and yellow jumper
<RobotPinkie> I'm gonna try and see what happens, EspyLacopa
<NewDCD> 9TRANS-AM
<Seviper> I mean, it looks good, but it gets kinda boring
<Monkey_Zombie> awesome
<NewDCD> 9SCOOTALOO F. SEIEI
<NewDCD> 9CUTTING THE WAY TO THE FUTURE!
<SilkAMV> I wonder why the main car in REDLINE is called the Transam?
<Happy-Kah> look! you tell me that doesn't look like a sleve
<NewDCD> 9Because Japan loves Trans-Am
<RobotPinkie> It's like... only an hour or so left of my Spitfire countdown
<RobotPinkie> ohay ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> 2,14 howdy
<NewDCD> 9This attack: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/8cf081064fbf91cfde15d50b9ca0c620/19727%20-%20gundam%20rainbow_dash%20super_robot_wars.png
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol DCD, did you shop that?
<FlaschenJoe11> Awesome
<NewDCD> 9naw
<NewDCD> 9I just found it in Ponibooru
<NewDCD> 9someone apparently did a lot of Z2 Pony Attacks
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah, oh well
<ValtheJean> 2,14 o rly?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 any Dancougar ponies? OH OH! Veritech Ponies????
<NewDCD> 9no Valks
<NewDCD> 9but there is Dancougar http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/318120f0fcbcb8fe9688e1d67b9f16d1/17871%20-%20applejack%20attempt%20crossover%20rainbow_dash%20rarity%20super_robot_wars%20twilight_sparkle.png
<Monkey_Zombie> I'mma go look for SRWZ translation
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sadface.jpg
<NewDCD> 9if it existed
<NewDCD> 9I'd have it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<Ostbullen> Nice, a lot of bronies here already!
<NewDCD> 9so far only Alpha Gaiden, SRW 1, SRW 3 and SRW J have been translated
<EspyLacopa> Oh, this isn't a lot.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I looked up vids of (think it was called) Alpha...I squee'd at the SDF 1
<NewDCD> 9OG 1 and OG 2 were localized for the GBA
<NewDCD> 9and that's it
<NewDCD> 9it's enough to learn how to play though
<EspyLacopa> We won't get A Lot until around 7 or so, when the movies start.
<EspyLacopa> We'll probably hit around 200+ users then.
<NewDCD> 9yeah, Alpha Gaiden has the original Skull Squadron
<FlaschenJoe11> Alpha 3 is my personal fav
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so much want
<EspyLacopa> Final move against the boss should be the Moon Punishment Punch
<NewDCD> 9I have something better planned
<NewDCD> 9...If Garrod decides to charge up
<Monkey_Zombie> Final move: Taste the rainbow MF
<Seviper> wait how did he only take 10 damage
<SilkAMV> better than moon banishment?
<NewDCD> 9because I used a defensive Spirit Command
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<SilkAMV> What could be better than that?
<NewDCD> 9but he didn't decide to charge
<ValtheJean> 2,14 wait? are you streaming now?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 OMG MUST TURN ON MAI STREAM
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I saw Big-O!!!!!
<SilkAMV> TIME TO TASTE THE PAINBOW!!!
<NewDCD> 9ah well
<NewDCD> 9time for PHOTON BEAM
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you know, I used to be "meh" about Mazinger...but he's really started to grow on me
<NewDCD> 9of course he did
<NewDCD> 9he's the first Super Robot
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I was wondering that....I had my suspicions
<Monkey_Zombie> really now?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but since I'm not too fluent in super fighting robot lore I figured I wouldn't say anything :P
<Monkey_Zombie> Thats awesome
<NewDCD> 9well if you don't count Tetsujin
<NewDCD> 9he's the first PILOTEABLE robot
<Kayube> Didn't expect to see SRW on here... I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
<FlaschenJoe11> FUUUUUUUUUU-
<SilkAMV> Tetzujin is also in REDLINE. Suddenly I'm realizing how many references that movie has.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I must get this game...I want it....so badlt
<ValtheJean> 2,14 badly* even
<NewDCD> 9OH SHIT THIS EVENT
<AllisZero> Really? I watched Redline but didn't get that reference.
<NewDCD> 9http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/0c570ed967488396d9801da2e10217ec/18453%20-%20Getter_robo%20Sweetie_Belle%20apple_bloom%20comic%20mecha%20robot%20scootabeam%20scootaloo%20super_robot_wars.png
<NewDCD> 9THIS IS NOW IN FULL EFFECT
<EspyLacopa> LordGenome?
<SilkAMV> He was the Machine Head racer
<SilkAMV> The redline champion
<AllisZero> Hmm
<ValtheJean> 2,14 heh...scootabeam....
<NewDCD> 9SCOOTA BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<RobotPinkie> is his name Ryoma or something?
<FlaschenJoe11> SSSSWWWWEEEEEETTTT!
<NewDCD> 9YES
<NewDCD> 9His name is Ryoma
<FlaschenJoe11> yup
*ValtheJean 2,14 wants to see Big-O smash someone :P
<EspyLacopa> This game is so delightfully over the top.
<Monkey_Zombie> YEAH!
<Monkey_Zombie> GURREN LAGGAN!
<RobotPinkie> My Japanese isn't all that good, and I don't remember much of Getter Robo
<ValtheJean> 2,14 YES
<SilkAMV> It's funny how Dai-gurren is too epic for this game
<ValtheJean> 2,14 BIG-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<FlaschenJoe11> THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU COMBINE THE MOST HOT-BLOODED SHOWS IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!
<EspyLacopa> Now imagine if Kamina was in this.
<CaptainSig> He is.
<NewDCD> 9he was
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I have no idea how this universe is stable
<FlaschenJoe11> He was
<CaptainSig> But Kamina died
<NewDCD> 9he just died already
<CaptainSig> Forever.
<crono_flash> TO bad this game doesn't have vs mode
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no universe could possibly be this awesome and not explode on itself
<FlaschenJoe11> But avenged himself
<SilkAMV> No he didn't :'(
<NewDCD> 9Val, there is Equestria
<EspyLacopa> This universe runs on the power of Awesome.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ah, good point :P
<NewDCD> 9now if we gave Equestria mechs....
<CaptainSig> So, allow me to ask.
<CaptainSig> Why the SRW?
<NewDCD> 9FIN FUNNEL RAPE
<EspyLacopa> Unlike places like Trigun and Equestria, which are made of Love and Peace.
<FlaschenJoe11> DON'T the universe couldn'
<FlaschenJoe11> t handle that
<Kayube> Fuun Saiki.
<WhatPayne> I've distilled an elixir of lead and pomegranate
<SilkAMV> So, who's using what pony in Fighting is Magic?
*ValtheJean 2,14 still thinks Talgeese should have been more than just a cameo in this game :P
<CaptainSig> Dunno. I just came for the SRW.
<Happy-Kah> nearly fell asleep wearing my contacts
<RobotPinkie> I came for the ponies
<crono_flash> I'll be using Rainbow Dash SilkAMV
<CaptainSig> It's a shame SRW Z2 doesn't have such a kickass OST as OGS.
<SilkAMV> I'll be using Marshmellow poni. I got her in the personality test.
<NewDCD> 9Sig: you're now imagining Folka and Kyosuke in Z2
<the> 0my brother hates when i say "everypony" or "anypony" or "somepony"
<SilkAMV> I am best poni
<the> 0that makes it more fun to do so
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the: you should call him a silly filly :P
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie Pie is objectively best pony. :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Oh! I like this guy
<CaptainSig> Hehe.
<CaptainSig> Alteisen was FTW.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he is teh snoipah
<SilkAMV> No, it is Rarity
<the> 0he basicly called me a colt cuddler.
<CaptainSig> Lamia in Z2 would be awesome too.
<RobotPinkie> Gilda is best pony
<NewDCD> 9DAT DYNAMIC KILL
<the> 0im going to start using all pony talk when talking to him.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you could say his effectiveness
<Andrevus> uhh no
<CaptainSig> Still though- WTB moar translated SRW's.
<prince-dari> Also, lol at your MOTD.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 *glasses*
<Andrevus> Gilda is best gryphon
<ValtheJean> 2,14 got halved
<prince-dari> Did you leave it on purpose? XD
<RobotPinkie> Steven Magnet is best pony, then
<NewDCD> 9YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<CaptainSig> ...
<CaptainSig> Magneto?
<the> 0MAGNIETO!
<RobotPinkie> I think everyone can agree on that one.
<Andrevus> Magneighto
<the> 0but steven magnet isnt even a pony
<the> 0he is a river serpent
<lightningrose> magneto XD
<RobotPinkie> Steven Magnet is Magneto's ponysona
<CaptainSig> his last name is magnet-
<CaptainSig> therefor he must kick ass
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh dcd...is that guy the main character from the anime you showed us?
<SilkAMV> Rarity built her own business from the ground up. She devoted her entire career and to making other people look better. Yet she threw it all away without hesitation to make her friends happy.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the one with the green beam
<EspyLacopa> Trick your brother into watching Season 1.
<NewDCD> 9yeah Val
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I thought I recognized him
<Pontang> prince-dari: eventually we'll have one.
<Pontang> :p
<Seviper> So just to clarify, is the stream starting at 2pm or 7pm?
<CaptainSig> Hmm.. is Gundam Deathscythe in Z2?
<NewDCD> 9GARrod Ran
<RobotPinkie> "Gainer" or something?
<CaptainSig> or Sandrock?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 7pm seviper
<NewDCD> 9it is
<NewDCD> 9I just didn't deploy any Wing units
<CaptainSig> You're the player?
<SilkAMV> Where my Epyon at?
<Seviper> Alrighty, see you guys tonight then
<CaptainSig> Think you can show me a Giga Drill Breaker in a sec?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 see you then
<RobotPinkie> There's no Giant Robo in this, therefore it's not perfect :P
<NewDCD> 9indeed
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but it has veritechs. Which means I love it :P
<RobotPinkie> Don't get me wrong, I think this looks awesome
<NewDCD> 9Giant Robo
<NewDCD> 9is in Alpha 1
<RobotPinkie> but there are some mechs I'd really love to see in it
<NewDCD> 9but then the creator died
<CaptainSig> Daitarn.
<NewDCD> 9and the copyright holders were a bitch
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I know
<NewDCD> 9and didn't want it in any more SRW
<RobotPinkie> You've told me :(
<CaptainSig> Always are.
<CaptainSig> Same reason why we don't get more translated SRWs.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you'd think that if the creator was okay with it in life that there wouldn't BE any copyright claim
<EspyLacopa> I'd think the copyright holders would /want/ more money.
<NewDCD> 9it's the same with Eva
<NewDCD> 9if it wasn't for Anno
<ValtheJean> 2,14 considering the idea BEHIND copyright is protecting the ideas of the individual responsible
<NewDCD> 9Eva wouldn't have made it into SRW
<CaptainSig> Yeah, but the company doesn't like asking for copyrights lmao.
<NewDCD> 9he just fucked shit up saying "NO WAY IN HELL MY EVA WILL BE FIGHTING ALONGSIDE GETTER AND MAZINGER. DEAL THE FUCK WITH IT"
<EspyLacopa> SRW fans to stingy copyright holders: "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!"
<NewDCD> 9*WILL NOT
<RobotPinkie> The one thing I love about Evangelion are the giant robot fights
<CaptainSig> I love SRW for one thing-
<CaptainSig> They made Shinji not a bitch.
<NewDCD> 9I've told them the story
<Pontang> RobotPinkie: god forbid, that's the only thing Evangelion had going for it (And the music)
<CaptainSig> He went from a crybaby in Evangelion to a cool person in SRW.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 don't think I've seen this ship before
<NewDCD> 9Rejectan Instrumentalitan, Telling Gendou to fuck his shit uppan
<RobotPinkie> I take it you don't agree, Pontang
<FlaschenJoe11> He was made into a classic SR pilot
<NewDCD> 9it was more like
<RobotPinkie> or was that serious?
<NewDCD> 9he went from normal person in Eva/Alpha 1
<FlaschenJoe11> You couldn't handle half the stuff
<Pontang> Oh no, I liked the fights. =s
<NewDCD> 9to fucking badass in Alpha 3
<RobotPinkie> lol I can't tell :P
<CaptainSig> Yeah, that.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Oh I like this bot
<NewDCD> 9Pontang only likes reals
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, animations are awesome sometimes in Eva
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he's like...a samurai mecha
<Kayube> I have this song on my computer.
<NewDCD> 9Eva is kind of in the middle of the Real/Super Spectrum
<RobotPinkie> Some of the robot battles blew my mind
<Pontang> But I never got the hype behind Eva.
<EspyLacopa> Transformers would be under Real Robots, yes?
<Pontang> NewDCD: I love RahXephon.
<Pontang> =3
<RobotPinkie> but good god the story, I just can't stand it
<CaptainSig> Hmmm..
<NewDCD> 9that's a tough call
<CaptainSig> I'm not sure.
<CaptainSig> They're big enough to be supers.
<CaptainSig> They're about as big as Grungusts, aren't they?
<RobotPinkie> I respect that some people do, but I just can't
<the> 0i need to go to bed in around 3 hours or so right?
<the> 0in order to wake up for movie night
<CaptainSig> Also, I love the Getter.
<NewDCD> 9nah Sig
<MeteorVenture> the real reason people watched evangelion was all the nude scenes.. and the music
<NewDCD> 9they're kind of Gunda-Bing
<RobotPinkie> I also wub Brain Powerd
<NewDCD> 9*Gundam-Big
<RobotPinkie> srsly
<RobotPinkie> SRSLY love Brain Powerd
<Monkey_Zombie> I'll be back
<CaptainSig> My memory's failing me-
<NewDCD> 9Brain Powerds are reals according to J
<Pontang> I suppose when I've watched so many 80s mecha that Evangelion wasn't particularly special.
<Hat> What is this. I don't even.
<RobotPinkie> J, NewDCD?
<CaptainSig> RObots.
<NewDCD> 9SRW J
<Pontang> I suppose it annoys me when people hail it as the greatest anime 'evar'.
<RobotPinkie> Ohhh, cool
<NewDCD> 9their stats are Real-type
<ValtheJean> 2,14 is it just my internet, or is anyone else getting stutters in the stream?
<CaptainSig> Stat-wise they'd be reals, yeah.
<CaptainSig> Really rarely @ Valthe
<SilkAMV> no I'm getting them too
<Flutteryay> Eva is NOT the greatest anime ever
<RobotPinkie> Same here, Pontang
<crono_flash> Me too VAltheJean
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh okay
<SilkAMV> Hope the episode doesn't lag
<CaptainSig> I much prefer Gurren Lagann over Evangelion.
<SilkAMV> But I suppose it's inevitable
<NewDCD> 9the obvious explanation:
<FlaschenJoe11> it's more of a Character Study
<Flutteryay> I LOVE Gurren Lagann
<RobotPinkie> Getting stutters from time to time, yeah, sound's off though for poni most of the time :P
<NewDCD> 9Getter is too much POWER OF EVOLUTION for the stream to handle
<ponynaut> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/memes-kia-rage.jpg
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<CaptainSig> That's why Z2 is awesome.
<MeteorVenture> the reason i haven't and most likely won't watch evangelion is the nude scenes
<CaptainSig> Did you hear Getter's theme in Alpha?
<RobotPinkie> I enjoyed Gundam Wing a lot, too, though I know it's not as good as some other Gundams
<NewDCD> 9Wing was bland as fuck for me
<RobotPinkie> The robots were just really nice, though
<Pontang> Ehh, it's not as bad as SEED.
<RobotPinkie> I love Zero, omfg
<NewDCD> 9well it's hard to be as bad as SEED
<Pontang> That's all I can say about it.
<RobotPinkie> One of my favorite mechs
<CaptainSig> SEED Looked cool, but I heard it kinda blows hardcore.
<crono_flash> How about Mobile Fighter G Gundam NewDCD?
<NewDCD> 9G is great
<Pontang> SEED becomes quite the drama around episode 30. Then it drops to hell.
<RobotPinkie> Damn...
<CaptainSig> Didn't the getter pilot used to have better Go Nagai sideburns, though?
<SilkAMV> Am I a bad person for liking 00 Gundam?
<Pontang> That is what irks me about SEED. It had potential but threw it down the drain to be stupid.
<CaptainSig> Or did they ditch that in Z2?
<NewDCD> 9Getter is fucking shit up
<RobotPinkie> Well, there's plenty of other Gundams to watch
<Pontang> SilkAMV: it's not bad at all.
<NewDCD> 9Sig: he does have them
<RobotPinkie> No, SilkAMV
<NewDCD> 9it's just ahrd to see on the mugshot
<crono_flash> Is Domon Kasshu in z2?
<Flutteryay> Gundam 00 is the only one that caught my attention at all
<ValtheJean> 2,14 though he's gona need to get a resupply soon
<SilkAMV> I hear so much crap about it I don't get
<CaptainSig> I mean the bigger ones.
<Pontang> But I'm more of a fan of Tomino Yoshiyuki than I am of Gundam.
<SilkAMV> Why didn't people like it?
<CaptainSig> That's like.. not attached to his face.
<Flutteryay> I like TTGL, Code Geass, and Evangelion
<RobotPinkie> Not exactly my favorite mech series, but really good I thought
<NewDCD> 9Gette is pretty much the precursor of Eva
<RobotPinkie> lol some Gundam fans are VERY picky about their Gundams, SilkAMV
<CaptainSig> Getter is cooler though.
<NewDCD> 9DERP
<NewDCD> 9I mean
<CaptainSig> Simply 'cuz of old time's sake.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not a big gundam fan myself. But all I know is that Talgeese (versions I,II,III) is badass
<NewDCD> 9Gurren Lagann
<SilkAMV> Geass Jumped the shark too many times for my taste. And not in the good way TTGL did.
<Bendude75> hello?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and thus deserves my love :P
<Pontang> But yeah, after I watched L-GAIM, I was hooked on Tomino.
<RobotPinkie> I've pretty much only heard crap about how bad Wing is, which is why I tend to mention that I like it :P
<Pontang> :D
<Bendude75> when is next stream/
<Pontang> SilkAMV: many mecha do sadly.
<Bendude75> ?
<Flutteryay> I'm turned off by GaoGaiGar because one gy I encountered besically told me to stop liking Gurren Lagann because he doesn't like it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the next BMN is 7PM EST today
<CaptainSig> Tell him to eat a dick @ Flutteryay
<crono_flash> NewDCD, are you up for a match in BlazBlue later?
<Bendude75> uk time?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 holy giant rock monster batman!
<NewDCD> 9GaoGaiGar is great
<NewDCD> 9and Gurren Lagann is a love letter to mech anime in general
<NewDCD> 9specially supers
<Flutteryay> I did tell him to eat my ex-boyfriend's choe actuallty
<Flutteryay> *actually
<NewDCD> 9GL is much more enjoyable when you know what it's tributing
<RobotPinkie> Which BlazBlue, crono_flash?
<CaptainSig> Use faith on getter 'fore he dies, lol.
<Flutteryay> *chode
<RobotPinkie> I have Calamity Trigger
<NewDCD> 9Garrod y u no charge Satellite Cannon?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 BIG-O!!!!! ACTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NewDCD> 9also I gotta do some Homework after this LOL
<crono_flash> I can play either of the PSP games
<NewDCD> 9long stage is long
<RobotPinkie> Aw, I only have PS3 version
<CaptainSig> Dude, NewDCD, are you emulating this or do you really have your PSP hooked up lol?
<RobotPinkie> Haha, was kinda hoping for a fight, there :P
<crono_flash> it's his PSP
<CaptainSig> Hmm.
<crono_flash> I don't even have a PS3 yet:P
<RobotPinkie> He has his PSP hooked up
<NewDCD> 9PSP + Remotejoy
<NewDCD> 9no good PSP emulators yet
<Princess_Luna> This irc...
<Princess_Luna> lol
<CaptainSig> That's a shame.
<Princess_Luna> And hello :D
<CaptainSig> I'd grab SRWZ2 but my PSP's a bitch.
<Princess_Luna> :)
<Flutteryay> Hi!
<CaptainSig> Analog nub's f00ked.
<Flutteryay> SEASON 2, LESS THAN 24 HOURS
<CaptainSig> 'Lo.
<Flutteryay> MY BODY IS READY
<NewDCD> 9you don't need analog for Z2
<NewDCD> 9Wow
<CaptainSig> I know-
<NewDCD> 9 5 more HP and WHAM, BAM, STRAIGHT TO THE MOONAH
<CaptainSig> But it's fucked as in it keeps moving left.
<CaptainSig> So it interferes with every game I play.
<CaptainSig> Worst moment to happen, too. I almost finished GEB.
<crono_flash> I'll be back later, catch everyone at the pre-show
<NewDCD> 9you can disable your Analog with CFW
<SuperBrony64> Top of the morning everypony!
<CaptainSig> <-- has no CFW.
<Flutteryay> Oh my god, Bronystate should do a marathon of TTGL
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hello superbrony
<CaptainSig> I actually have to buy all that crap.
<SilkAMV> It's not morning anymore
<SilkAMV> Well, not since 10 minutes ago
<NewDCD> 9Flutteryay: tomorrow we'll air the two movies back to back
<SilkAMV> MOOOOOOOOOOOON
<Awesomeshy> xfd
<SilkAMV> damn
<Flutteryay> NewDCD: I'M SO THERE
<CaptainSig> 5 HP.
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: In realtime?!
<CaptainSig> Again.
<RobotPinkie> Still haven't had time to finish watching Kamen Rider Kuuga
<Flutteryay> PONY AND GURREN LAGANN, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANYTHING MORE AWESOME?
<NewDCD> 9yeah around 9:30 PM EST
<EspyLacopa> What series is that guy with the extending moon punch from?
<NewDCD> 9Espy: Genesis of Aquarion
<CaptainSig> I do, Flutteryay.
<Kayube> Ah, Aquarion... I saw the first episode once. Not sure if I should watch more of it.
<CaptainSig> Pony, Gurren Lagann and Getter Robo.
<Flutteryay> Touche!
<NewDCD> 9oh
<NewDCD> 9RIGHT after the premiere
<NewDCD> 9I'm streaming Mazinkaiser SKL
<CaptainSig> And a few million other mecha things, too!
<RobotPinkie> Wow, so many people here already
<CaptainSig> A friend linked me here. Said that there were robots.
<Kayube> MLP for SRW?
<Tovler> We're here in case there's a 200 person limit
<NewDCD> 9God I'd play MLP SRW so hard
<Flutteryay> CaptainSig: Did you notice the GIGA DRILL BREAKER the Pegasus ponies did in Winter Wrap Up?
<NewDCD> 9and then Big Mac piloted the Alteisen
<RobotPinkie> Friendship is Giant Robots
<Luna> 07there is no 200 person limit here
<CaptainSig> I did not.
<CaptainSig> I didn't see too much of the pony stuff, actually.
<Flutteryay> It's when they clear out the clouds
<CaptainSig> The things I saw were pretty cool, though.
<Flutteryay> Oh I see
<NewDCD> 9fun fact: we're preparing a chatroom surprise
<SuperBrony64> I saw it.
<Flutteryay> Yay
<ValtheJean> 2,14 DCD: SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<CaptainSig> You mean at Rainbow Dash's introduction?
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: Is it free candy?
<CaptainSig> I'll youtube it.
<Flutteryay> At the very end
<NewDCD> 9something like that
<RobotPinkie> Yeah I guess most people are here because of the giant robots, but personally I like ponies a bit more :(
<NewDCD> 9it might or it might not involve Giant Robots
<Flutteryay> I like Ponies and giant robots equally
<NewDCD> 9I'll never get tired of Amuro's dynamic kill
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: We get our own Giant Robots?!
<NewDCD> 9LASTO SHOOTINGU
<CaptainSig> I prefer robots, but I'm still sticking around for the S2 premiere.
<Flutteryay> yay
<CaptainSig> "Frank Sinatra has finished downloading." Oh, fuck, yeah.
<NewDCD> 9dat Scopedog
<Crakcerjack> ohai
<RobotPinkie> Scopedog used to be Scope Doggy Dogg
<CaptainSig> In a way I'm waiting 'till a troll shows up.
<CaptainSig> Wanna see how stuff goes down when they do.
<Crakcerjack> i heard on facebook that this site will be streaming the the first episode for season 2? :O
<NewDCD> 9if a troll shows up
<SilkAMV> They are loved
<NewDCD> 9I'd go MUGEN PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWNCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<NewDCD> 9yes, yes we will
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that is correct crakcerjack
<CaptainSig> xD
<CaptainSig> Samurai Champloo's awesome.
<Crakcerjack> :D!
<NewDCD> 9we're the most hot-blooded stream in the internet
<CaptainSig> You've got SRW.
<CaptainSig> 'nuff said.
<IrOnLoRe> Hello, how is everyone doing today?
<SilkAMV> However I'm very much expecting it to lag like a mofo
<CaptainSig> Like a donut in a garage, Ironlore.
<SuperBrony64> Hey IrOnLoRe, pretty good.
<Crakcerjack> i was super excited because my best friend and I don't have the HUB and we have been searching all over for a stream :D
<RobotPinkie> This stream is 99% hot blooded and 1% manly tears
<NewDCD> 9I don't believe it will. Also we have an LQ stream for that
<Crakcerjack> Lol Robot xD
<SuperBrony64> Two separate streams for maximum damage?
<SilkAMV> LQ is for mules
<CaptainSig> Manly Tears.
<NewDCD> 9wow the stream is really behind
<Crakcerjack> So all I have to do is come to the site and you'll be streaming it?
<CaptainSig> ...We need Folka and Fernando up in this bitch.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you got it crakcer
<SuperBrony64> Crakcerjack: Yup
<Crakcerjack> :awwyeah:
<NewDCD> 9brb refreshan
<SuperBrony64> It's like the internet does the work for you. You just sit back and internet.
<Crakcerjack> SWEET!
<CaptainSig> Dai-Gurren.
<Flutteryay> I hear the Gurren Lagann theme!
<CaptainSig> Yeah.
<FlaschenJoe11> Dai-Gurren rocks!
<NewDCD> still really behind
<CaptainSig> That's a vocal-less version of Sorairo days.
<Flutteryay> :D
<Flutteryay> I love that song
<CaptainSig> Used by every TTGL pilot.
<SuperBrony64> Hmmâ€¦I see we're watching more robots.
<CaptainSig> If you want I can link you it later.
<SuperBrony64> Quite good, quite good.
<NewDCD> 9guys
<NewDCD> 9gonna go offline for a second
<CaptainSig> guy.
<AllisZero> NEVER
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: I guess we'll live with that :/
<AllisZero> NEVER NEVER NEVER
<AllisZero> Take a 20-minute call while Wireless Tether is running on your phone
<NewDCD> 9we're live again
<AllisZero> NEVERRRRR
<AllisZero> my ear is burning
<SuperBrony64> Wow, that was literally a second...

<CaptainSig> I row knight.
<Flutteryay> Is there something wrong with thr stream?
<Crakcerjack> :yay:
<Crakcerjack> lol
<Flutteryay> It keeps stopping every few seconds
<Crakcerjack> Huh? no.
<mixonBrony> Not for me.
<CaptainSig> I gotta say that Breast Fire's a lame ultimate attack.
<Jessim> I'm not getting it. "The stream is currently offline"
<EspyLacopa> Huh, 99,800 health eh?
<Crakcerjack> me either
<Flutteryay> I really hope Ghost doesn't do a show today.
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: Do you understand what either of them are saying?
<Flutteryay> I don't want to be tempted
<CaptainSig> Try refreshing, Jessim?
<Jessim> I set it to low quality, and now it's fine
<gentlecolt> IM A MELTING POT OF FRIENDSHIP
<CaptainSig> Your PC couldn't handle the girth of SRWZ2.
<Flutteryay> I'M A NICE GUYYYYYYYY
<mib_se1x83> omg 24 hours till season 2
<Jessim> Yeah.
<Luna> 07wrong
<Jessim> ^
<Flutteryay> I am your host, the man they call Ghost. I'm a goddamned racist. I'm a goddemned PIECE OF CRAP!
<Luna> 0720hrs 33 mins
<SuperBrony64> Less than 24 hours.
<CaptainSig> You mad, Flutteryay?
<Tovler> yep, Season 2 starts at 12:30pm Heh heh heh
<Tek> Yeah, I'm kind of confused at the times. Is this going to be played live at 9AM EST, or after the fact at 2PM EST?
<Flutteryay> Nah that's a song DJ Alex S made
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Tek: live
<Flutteryay> it's called Melting Pot of Alcohol
<Tek> sweet
<mib_qpitb7> so..... what is this game, it looks sexy
<CaptainSig> SRWz2
<SuperBrony64> mib_qpitb7: Super Robot Wars, I believe.
<Tovler> mfw, Ghost appears in Season 3.
<Jessim> Lol.
<mib_se1x83> too bad they dont have the hub on UK TV
<CaptainSig> Super Robot Wars Z2, yeah.
<CaptainSig> Think like a million robot animes combined into one disc of awesome.
<yves> what time does it premiere in australia?
<CaptainSig> Or in this case, an UMD.
<SuperBrony64> What console is this on? The GBA still?
<Jessim> CRITICAL
<CaptainSig> Ha, no.
<Jessim> It looks too high res for GBA
<CaptainSig> PSP.
<FlaschenJoe11> PSP
<Monkey_zombie> looks like PSP graphics
<SuperBrony64> Oh, makes sense.
<mib_qpitb7> this game's cutscenes are awesome... if only it was in engrish ;_;
<CaptainSig> It's for the PSP.
<Jessim> Which mlp episode should I watch before I start schoolwork?
<mib_se1x83> my screen says that the broadcast is offline
<mib_qpitb7> boastbusters
<CaptainSig> A cool one.
<CaptainSig> Herpderp.
<mib_s7vje4> winter wrap up
<ValtheJean> 2,14 anon: refresh
<Jessim> Switch to low quality ^
<CaptainSig> Mib, try watching on LQ.
<mib_qpitb7> trixie <3
<SuperBrony64> Low quality just shows a cartoon playing :P
<Monkey_zombie> Can you fuse Dai-gurren with Gurren Laggan to make Tengen toppa?
<Jessim> I haven't seen boast busters in a while.
<Jessim> I'll watch that one.
<mib_se1x83> valt I did and it still says it
<NewDCD> 9yeah the LQ Stream ain't live
<CaptainSig> Nope.
<CaptainSig> Z2's part 1 of Gurren Lagann.
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: Oh, okay.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 then I dont know what to tell you, it's working fine for everyone else. Are you using bronystate.net?
<mib_qpitb7> so, is there a way to change my name, didn't even mean to choose this D:
<CaptainSig> Gurren Lagann + Flying Module is the final form of it in Z2.
<CaptainSig> The next one's been said to do TTGL S2 though, with TTGL.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you'll have to /quit and relog with a different name
<CaptainSig> Maybe even STTGL
<SuperBrony64> Or you could use /nick?
<mib_qpitb7> alrighty, thanks
<Monkey_zombie> nice
<mib_se1x83> im using dinkypage.com/bronystate
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's why
<CaptainSig> Anyhow, I'm going to bail now.
<CaptainSig> Later, everyone.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 use www.bronystate.net
<NewDCD> 9wow
<SuperBrony64> Wrong site mib_se1x83 .
<Monkey_zombie> for some reason I can't stand gundam
<NewDCD> 9that was...nice, Chirico
<NewDCD> 9a lot of damage for a Real
<Monkey_zombie> why is the stream stopping ever few seconds?
<Jessim> Not a a clue.
<mib_hee5dw> im back
<Tek> Flash just crashed for me.
<mib_hee5dw> lol vidoe game
<Yoshi> aha, name changed
<Jessim> I was thinking it was just my crazy-slow internet
<mib_hee5dw> yesh
<NewDCD> 9let's hope that makes everything better
<Monkey_zombie> you might be able to get him to half health before noon.
<SuperBrony64> It stops every now and then for me as well. It's normal most likely due to the increased volume of users.
<Yoshi> that sludge monster... he just wont die
<SilkAMV> what the hell is he anyway?
<Nyst> So um, why is this screen showing robots fighting, but the popout is playing Megas XLR?
<NewDCD> 9because the popout ain't live
<SilkAMV> MEGAS Y U NO IN THIS GAME
<Nyst> Ah okay, thanks
<NewDCD> 9not yet at least
<RobotPinkie> lolmegas
<Nyst> Megas is too OP for this game.
<Rodman> SilkAMV, he'd be overpowered like hell
<NewDCD> 9Translator's note: OP means American
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'd love to see megas in one of these games
<Monkey_zombie> megas is to American for this game
<RobotPinkie> Haha :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 especially because that means Glorft would be fightable enemies :P
<Nyst> Megas just needs to press the 'win' button...literally
<Rodman> Plus, friendly fire would be on as well
<Rodman> Not only for AOE attacks
<Rodman> ALL ATAACKS
<ValtheJean> 2,14 also, just imagine his dynamic kill: teleporting a soda bottle to the enemy's computer
<Rodman> *attacks
<Nyst> Every time an enemy survives he just hits the next button
<Nyst> 'Win' 'Bigger Win' 'Biggest Win' 'Epic Win' and so forth
<RobotPinkie> I take it I'm the only one who wants to see NewDCD finish Tomb Raider Anniversary :P
<Rodman> The attack list would be epic though
<Rodman> For missile attacks "Fire Missiles" "More Missiles" "Even MORE Missiles" "FIRE ALL THE MISSILES!"
<mib_s7vje4> moar dakka
<EspyLacopa> Reminds me of stuff from Megas XLR
<Nyst> And when all else fails, punch it with your fists.
<Rodman> That's what we're talking about
<EspyLacopa> Heh
<Rodman> Megas in this game
<Nyst> His fists also shoot guns and missiles.
<Trouble> When do the ponies start? just asking.....
<Nyst> As do his feet...or any part of his body.
<NewDCD> 9oh wow the sstream caught up
<Monkey_zombie> Aquarion
<NewDCD> 9I think the skipping is over
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ponies start after the movies tonight trouble
<EspyLacopa> Megas isn't in this game for the same reason this game hasn't been brought over into english language.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 nah DCd...I'm still getting it =/
<Trouble> Oh! so not until 5-ish?
<SilkAMV> To awesome to do?
<NewDCD> 9ffffffffffffffffffffff
<Monkey_zombie> I'm still getting freezes too,
<Rodman> And that reason being which EspyLacopa?
<Rodman> ^^^^^^This
<Monkey_zombie> I can deal if its too much trouble
<NewDCD> 9I'm going to try streaming something else after this
<NewDCD> 9and see if it's just SRW
<prince-dari> I don't seem to be getting lag.
<prince-dari> And lol at how many anons there are i nhere.
<Tifa> Hope Pinkie breaks more fourth walls XD
<Rodman> Surprisingly, me neither
<prince-dari> in here*
<NewDCD> 9so no skipping?
<Luna> 07neither am I atm
<NewDCD> 9because dari, that worries me
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm still getting it, but it might be my internet
<lolbronys> hi
<Luna> 07it's Val of course!
<RobotPinkie> Nice, new CGR review
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :<
<SilkAMV> no I'm getting it too
<Luna> 07Val's provider is derpy net ;)
<prince-dari> Hmm, I get a couple skips here and ther actually.
<Rodman> And now it started to skip for me
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no! It's just they decide to do stupid maintenance all the time!
<EspyLacopa> Super attack time!
<Crainy> hi everybrony!
<Luna> 07see derpy net :)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it should be fine NOW though =/
<NewDCD> 9FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-
<Flutteryay> Rainbow Dash's favorite genre of music is WUBSTEP.
<Flutteryay> wub wub woo wub wub woo wub wub wubwubwubwubwub wub wub wobwobwob bwooooow bwubwubwubwub bwooooow bwobwobwobwob
<Rodman> 95 people
<Tovler> I love this fanon so much that I might name my first son Fahnon.
<SuperBrony64> Hey, Steam is making Portal free until September 20th!
<VioletVanilla> 6Derpy Net Services! Where they give bytes, we fly kites!
<Rodman> That still ain't close to the limit, is it?
<Luna> 07exactly
<EspyLacopa> Oh, they're doing that sale again?
<Stonegaze> Getting some hiccups here too.
<EspyLacopa> Big mech is big.
<NewDCD> 9SuperBrony64: THANKS FOR TELLING ME
<EspyLacopa> He's crossing the streams!
<SilkAMV> Are there any orbital frames in this game?
<Tek> Yeah getting some random pauses as well.
<Luna> 07yep me too now
<SuperBrony64> NewDCD: Np, apparently they're doing it because classrooms are using Portal for educational purposes.
<mib_hee5dw> lol
<Luna> 07what is that thing btw...?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they're also doing it because they know everyone already HAS it
<Tek> It's also randomly stopping, so I have to press play again.
<SuperBrony64> ValtheJean: Lol, that too.
<mib_hee5dw> mabey
<NewDCD> 9the only other Vidja series I've seen in SRW is Virtual On
<NewDCD> 9I don't
<NewDCD> 9I'm poor like that ;___;
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you never got Portal?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 like...did you not buy the Orange Box?
<Stonegaze> Oh snap, they got Megas XLR in Low quality stream.
<Tovler> I'll be watching on two streams just in case.
<NewDCD> 9yeah. Gonna get it now though
<mib_hee5dw> im pretty sure pinkie will evaporate the fourth wall in season 2
<NewDCD> 9Megas is just a recording though
<SilkAMV> GIGA DRILL BREAKER
<SuperBrony64> I bought the Orange Box on Steam when it was on sale for $10
<FlaschenJoe11> GIGA DRILL BREAKERRR!!!!
<IrOnLoRe> I'm having the same problem, it's pausing but that's cause, of my computer.
<mib_s7vje4> imagine
<NewDCD> 9also
<NewDCD> 9this battle: http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/e5360f4d3fb3833cb9dddcf61f9af958/18532%20-%20Nightmare_Moon%20super_robot_wars.png
<Yoshi> lol, these guys dont take damage
<mib_s7vje4> bazillion missiles come at you, and you take a step back, and take no damage, even though everything in a mile radius is turned to glass
<Yoshi> XD
<mib_s7vje4> imagine how annoying it would be if your sniper rifle beeped like that all the time
<SilkAMV> LOL HE MISSED
<Monkey_zombie> Do they have Gunsword?
<prince-dari> mib_s7vje4: You should see the attack that shears off half the mecha and it's still standing afterwards. :P
<SuperBrony64> Haha: http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/58869
<NewDCD> 9Gun X Sword is in SRW L I believe
<Awesomeshy> so many quits
<Awesomeshy> ohai zaco_mobile
<Pontang> So many
<Yoshi> missing a massive sludge-bot with a sniperrifle...
<Monkey_zombie> neat
<mib_s7vje4> it's the beeping i tell you
<Monkey_zombie> *click*
<llooll> sup
<NewDCD> 9he didn't miss
<Stonegaze> Damn you slow connection!
<NewDCD> 9he just SHOOTS TWICE AND HITS ON THE THIRD SHOT
<NewDCD> 9it's just his style
<Happy-Kah> lololol
<Kayube> Next time Nadesico is in a SRW they should have Gekiganger 3 as an actual unit.
<Yoshi> ahaha
<Rodman> Kayube, FUCK YES!
<Rodman> Nadesico's crew + Gurren Laggan
<Yoshi> does that thing have a massive sword cawk?
<Rodman> BEST! CROSSOVER! EVER!
<Routa> when's season 2 a'coming
<Monkey_zombie> I had a tooth pulled earlier and the gause is bugging me something fierce
<ponynaut> derp
<MeteorVenture> every time i see that time thingy for zelda i always hear that sound.. i'm not sure what it's supposed to be but it's like a gate closing or a portcullis or a bridge or something
<zaco_mobile> 'lo
<Happy-Kah> i need to get a fill in
<MeteorVenture> something really heavy sounding anyway
<Happy-Kah> but i am afraid of needles
<Monkey_zombie> I know the feeling
<MeteorVenture> it was the sound that went along with it though so it makes sense lol
<Monkey_zombie> I just close my eyes really tight and imagine the poking is a bee
<Happy-Kah> lol i have a full panic attack and nearly faint if i get one, fun!
<Happy-Kah> gahhhh i am afriad of bees too!
<FlaschenJoe11> bees, my god
<Monkey_zombie> or a potato chip the poked your mouth
<mib_s7vje4> imagine a wasp then
<Monkey_zombie> Their in my eyes!
<Happy-Kah> lol that is a good one^
<FlaschenJoe11> jk I respect bees
<zaco_mobile> The topic in this channel is gonna make me scrap
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's the one thing keeping me from going to Japan
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the Giant Hornets
<AllisZero> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knLCbS02T1Y
*AllisZero shivers
<prince-dari> Lol Val
<zaco_mobile> ; D
<Happy-Kah> wasps are even worse than bees!
<NewDCD> 9time to finish this
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dude dari, have you seen those god damn things?
<Happy-Kah> end it!
<prince-dari> Eeyup
<RobotPinkie> Yeah they've practically taken over Tokyo, Val :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they're like....the size of your hand!
<prince-dari> >has had wasps, bees, hornets, etc fly around and land on him all his life
<prince-dari> >has never been stung
<ValtheJean> 2,14 GET THEM OFF ME! I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ON ME
<Happy-Kah> wow
<ValtheJean> 2,14 AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, I've never been stung either
<Happy-Kah> lol i would run away flaling my arms and screaming
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but I'm deathly afraid of it
<prince-dari> If you leave them alone, they won't do anything to you.
<prince-dari> :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 considering my mother is allergic to them
*prince-dari adds to his list
<prince-dari> >attack RainBro dressed as a giant moth
*ValtheJean 2,14 is going to murder you dari
<prince-dari> >attack Val dressed as a giant hornet
<Happy-Kah> i have never been stung either, but also horribly afraid of them
<Rodman> Dari, Japanese Bees are huge
<Rodman> Basically spit acid fire
<Rodman> And could murder your ass if you got close
<RobotPinkie> Anyone want to see a size comparison, so you know how big these giant hornets are? :P
<prince-dari> Rodman: I know how big they are
<Flutteryay> Sure
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'm not afraid! I have my +9 Trident of Hornet Repelling
<prince-dari> 2 inch wingspan
<Tek> It's not fun. I've had an entire nest swarm my face.
<Rodman> Besides anything that evolved in Australia, those things are high on my list of horrors to avoid at all costs
<Nyst> You can probably see them on wikipedia
<RobotPinkie> Don't look at this, Val http://cdn-www.cracked.com/articleimages/wong/gianthornet2.jpg
<IrOnLoRe> I have gotten stung before, it's not that bad only hurts for like a sec.
<Flutteryay> Those things look evil
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, they're pretty big
<prince-dari> >2 inch wasp
<MeteorVenture> beest
<prince-dari> >full sized human
<SirWilliam> the stream is lagging on my end...
<prince-dari> IDC about them.
<Happy-Kah> they looks sooooo evil
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah well, you're forgetting about the venom dari
<NewDCD> 9gonna restart the stream and try streaming something else, k?
<RobotPinkie> That's not 2 inches, prince-dari...
<Stonegaze> Does anybody else's stream lag?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 okie doki loki
<prince-dari> Yeah they are RobotPinkie.
<mib_s7vje4> yes
<SilkAMV> wait, he's almost dead
<mib_s7vje4> lots of lag
<prince-dari> Average.
<Monkey_zombie> finish off this boss first
<RobotPinkie> Though I agree that bees and such aren't anything to be afraid of
<Stonegaze> I get lag between every few seconds
<AllisZero> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4MqTCIDKhU
<AllisZero> This man disagrees, RP
<Monkey_zombie> Hornets you need to fear
<prince-dari> ^ Nope
<Tovler> I keep getting dropped
<Stonegaze> MY stream shut down.
<prince-dari> Hornets are just big wasps, nothing to fear about wasps.
<Monkey_zombie> They will sting the eff out of you for no paticular reason
<WhatPayne> When is the times for preshow requests?
<prince-dari> Unless you happen to be alergic.
<Happy-Kah> nicolas cage is a horilbe actor
<ValtheJean> 2,14 which is why I'm terrified dari :P
<MeteorVenture> dang dude.. close your mouth before you make me feel like i'm swallowing bees
<RobotPinkie> Well, AllisZero, the bees being a danger might have something to do with the thrashing and screaming.... :P
<Pontang> http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/newsfeed/000/174/201/UlnNI.jpg?1316102478
<NewDCD> 9we're live again
<RobotPinkie> and having his mouth wide open, seriously who would do that? :P
<NewDCD> 9your job is to tell me if this lags
<NewDCD> 9begin.
<SilkAMV> lags
<NewDCD> 9wait
<NewDCD> 9forgot to tweak audio source
<Happy-Kah> yes sir!
<Kabaka> Lawl
<NewDCD> 9okay
<AllisZero> Yeah, pretty much
<NewDCD> 9NOW We're live
<NewDCD> 9starting
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah still getting stutters
<SuperBrony64> Stutters for me as well.
<Monkey_zombie> lag
<Tek> Same
<RobotPinkie> If you see a bee, just nudge it out with the morning paper or something.
<SilkAMV> lagging like a mofo
<Happy-Kah> it is a little laggy for me
<EspyLacopa> Oho, what show is this?
<chedduhr> I burned my popcorn :D
<Happy-Kah> i have killed 3 wasps
<RobotPinkie> Yeah, getting lag
<Tifa> there's a bit of lagging here and there, good thing it lasts a few seconds
<Stonegaze> THis is odd. The strem didn't lag few hours back.
<RobotPinkie> There are a billion more people on it now, probably, lawl
<Happy-Kah> smegma?
<mib_s7vje4> what's this anime? also, lag, lag everywhere.
<FlaschenJoe11> i like her
<EspyLacopa> They're fighting Robotnik!
<EspyLacopa> Machine Island!
<Monkey_zombie> smegma is nasty dstuff
<Kayube> Yes, it keeps stopping/starting.
<RobotPinkie> What is an anime? A miserable pile of chibi?
<WhatPayne> ^
<Tifa> lag
<WhatPayne> Well don't know about the miserable pile part. But name would be cool
<MrChang> shup

<Happy-Kah> brb
<MrChang> uh
<MrChang> how come it says invalid PW for my name?
<WhatPayne> yeah quality is excellent, but it has some lag
<Stonegaze> Hope this lag gets fixed before the movies start.
<IrOnLoRe> RobotPinkie it's basically, Japan animation. Though chibi characters, are a huge thing in them now.
<NewDCD> 9MrChang
<RobotPinkie> Me too
<NewDCD> 9there were password resets
<MrChang> yes, DCD?
<MrChang> oh
<WhatPayne> What's that RobotPinkie?
<NewDCD> 9go to the help and ask for help
<MrChang> #help
<RobotPinkie> What's what, WhatPayne?
<NewDCD> 9#help
<WhatPayne> You too
<RobotPinkie> Oh, I hope the lag stops before stream time
<WhatPayne> Right, that.

<RobotPinkie> lolol

<SilkAMV> Don't bother with the spitfire time
<SilkAMV> nothing happens
<NewDCD> 9just for a while
<chedduhr> lol
<Flutteryay> I take that back, those were some of the cheesiest vocals I've ever heard.

<RobotPinkie> Rarity? Silly SilkAMV, that's not how you spell Trixie
<prince-dari> :P
<Andrevus> huh i can reach EQD
<Luna> 07zomg
<sixthgate> Hey everypony!
<Rainbow-Dash> Now all I need is Herospirit and RDash
<Luna> 07waaaaat
<NewDCD> I'm just glad the skipping was just me
<NewDCD> I was REALLY worried
<Luna> 07me too..
<ValtheJean> I can't remember...was it Luna or Celestia?
<sixthgate> i have a question for somepony to awnser plz!
<WhatPayne> Herospirit not here yet?
<Luna> 07go ahead
<prince-dari> Luna was the mods one, Celestia was the admin one (still not entirely happy with this system <_<)
<Jigglysaint> ah
<Rainbow-Dash> Nope, havent seen him.
<Luna> 07ohai Luna
<sixthgate> i wont be able to watch the stream of season 2 premire so iim trying to get a screan recorder program going
<Rainbow-Dash> Im sure he will suddenly pop in just any time now though
<WhatPayne> That's weird.
<ValtheJean> Woona within Woona? WOONACEPTION
<WhatPayne> I'd be surprised should he not.
<Luna> 07yerrrr
<sixthgate> but so far i cant find anyting that will run past an hour. i need something to run at least 10 hours or mor
<Luna> 07something like that :D
<sixthgate> or more
<sixthgate> anypony got any ideas? cant find anything from google either... TT-TT
<SuperBrony64> Sixthgate: Oh wow, I'd just wait till the episode appears on YouTube.
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> 0dat flank
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> 0=P
<ANON> YES SCHOOLS OUT EARLLLLLY
<SilkAMV> In 10 hours could you expect the episode to be on youtube anyway?
<sixthgate> O.o oh. Whoops! XD
<Happy-Kah> lol rarity looked like she was flirting with rainbow there
<SuperBrony64> If you want good quality for that long you'll more than likely need to pay for a program.
<bernd> try an old version of windows media encoder, this should be recording until your hard disk is full
<sixthgate> idk....? im gona be at work and i cant watch access the brony state there due to firewall crap
<SuperBrony64> Snapz Pro X works exceptionally well, but it only works on a Mac.
<Fenrir> rarity pony may be best pony, but rainbow-dash is out of her league >.>
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> 0yeah, I give it an hour from airing at the most for it to be on YT
<chedduhr> now rarity will make a man out of-AW MAN
<SuperBrony64> And you get a free 15 day trial for it
<SuperBrony64> Hurray Pinkie Pie song!
<Happy-Kah> *knows all the words*
<Luna> 07Oh god Woona sounds so adorable too
<Jigglysaint> what the heck?
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> 0who here doesn't?
<Rainbow-Dash> Im scared to turn my volume up.. I expect something like a screamer
<SilkAMV> SOOOOO
<ValtheJean> :P
<Rainbow-Dash> XD
<sixthgate> Thank you very much everypony! i think ill just wait for it to come YouTube cuz i have a downloader for that. XD
<Jigglysaint> well I'm Canadian so I have Treehouse TV
<Stonegaze> I can sing this song.
<Zephirdd> ohhhhhhhhh boy I'm excited
<Zephirdd> and its still a little less than a day for season 2
<Jigglysaint> it says for Sunday the 18th, the next episode is Trinidad Stilts
<Jigglysaint> that makes no freaking sense
<chedduhr> YEAH
<chedduhr> LOVE THIS ONE
<ValtheJean> I know not everyone is too keen about the whole S1 stream, but I am super excited about it
<Jigglysaint> unless it's a later episode
<sixthgate> wait wut? episode 2s name is trinidad stilts?!
<ValtheJean> I've been purposefully neglecting my pony addiction for this event :P
<Jigglysaint> no
<SuperBrony64> It should be The Return of Harmony Part 2
<Jigglysaint> that's the point
<Jigglysaint> http://treehousetv.com/watch/shows/MyLittlePony/default.aspx

<mib_45fwm2> This is pretty damn much effort put into a side pony that only had 2 lines in the entire show so far
<prince-dari> We may have a problem
<prince-dari> [18:30] *Rainbow-Dash* Curses. The stream derped. "Max connections from your IP"
<sixthgate> *crys rivers of tears like pinky pie from episode 2*
<Luna> 07sooo much me!
<LanceArrow> ...guys, I think something just went off in my pants.
<Stonegaze> That vid made me think about my old SNES.
<sixthgate> O.O
<chedduhr> that's because luna is best alicorn even with 2 lines
<Tifa> woona!
<WhatPayne> Luna is best pony methinks
<SuperBrony64> Derpy Hooves is just as popular and she only had one line :P
<mib_45fwm2> DONK

<Happy-Kah> oh this sounds cool!!
<RobotPinkie> her dad tells her so, anyway
<MightyMatrix> DJ-P0N3 is popular and she had no lines and was only on for 5 secs
<sixthgate> Louder stonegaze
<WhatPayne> Yeah, Imagine what would Luna be should she had more lines
<Stonegaze> yay.

<Jon> that this vid has been on loop for like the past hour?
<Zephirdd> you accidentally the whole thing jon?
<Jon> Just a feeling I have.
<SuperBrony64> We need a time bot for this room to tell us how long till Season 2 premieres.
<RobotPinkie> Would this count as A or B movie?
<Luna> 07Labyrinth?
<Jon> We don't have a countdown bot?
<MightyMatrix> 0A I think
<Stonegaze> Dari What are the numbers for?
<prince-dari> Traffic lights
<sixthgate> <FlaschenJoe11> I love you david bowie sama sensai sempi san samaaa!.... Kun!!

<prince-dari> >it freezes
<prince-dari> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
<prince-dari> What a troll
<SilkAMV> I prefer corridor of cupcakes
<Luna> 07evil flash I tell you!
<SuperBrony64> prince-dari: You don't get to decide when Flash closes. Flash decides, not you.
<prince-dari> XD
<prince-dari> True dat
<sixthgate> u know that one skit where applejack jumps off that plaform to help dashie get in the air faster than she can take off?
<SuperBrony64> Otherwise it takes your computer down with it.
<IrOnLoRe> Quick question, what's the cap of people for this stream/chat?
<chedduhr> lol love this pmv
<prince-dari> No cap.
<Rainbow-Dash> Flash is not evil, MLP FIM was made with flash.
<MightyMatrix> 0sweet
<sixthgate> someone took that same skit and put the music to JackAss the movie to it
<Nyst> This music makes me wonder; is MLP FIM known at all in Japan or on 2chan?
<NewDCD> 9cap is HOWEVER MANY WE CAN MANAGE
<mib_hokxu1> ya
<NewDCD> 9which is probably in the thousands
<prince-dari> And I'm sure during the time MLP was being made some of the animators learnt once again to save often.
<SuperBrony64> Rainbow-Dash: Wonder why Season 2 took so long to premiere? Now you know...
<prince-dari> BECAUSE FLASH WILL RANDOMLY CRASH ON YOU LIKE A BITCH
<PinkieThePie> hmmm, the chat popout doesn't seem to be working
<Rainbow-Dash> Thats true..
<prince-dari> PinkieThePie: If you're on www.bronystate.net it should
<sixthgate> OMG WHAT
<chedduhr> LONG LIVE THE AGE OF BRONY
<mib_hokxu1> either that or pinkie pie comes out the screen and crashed your flash
<PinkieThePie> i am, but when I click it all that happens is a blank windo opens
<mib_hokxu1> oh hey pinkie
<prince-dari> Ohhh
<Jon> So...why is the vid slightly off center?
<prince-dari> I know why.
<Jon> Just asking.
<prince-dari> PinkieThePie: Don't worry about it
<the> 0Alright, I think ima go shower and head to bed. so i can be awake for movie night/season 2
<the> 0later everypony
<Luna> 07so you can see the utube name ;)
<prince-dari> It's because I'm changing the system.
<chedduhr> lol
<IrOnLoRe> Alright, thanks NewDCD and prince-dari.
<SuperBrony64> I hear someone typing...
<prince-dari> Lawl
<prince-dari> G3
<mib_hokxu1> NO NOT G1
<SuperBrony64> You could just switch YouTube to HTML5 (http://www.youtube.com/html5
<RobotPinkie> 124 in chat and it's 5 hours before BMN
<prince-dari> Or G1.
<prince-dari> Whatever.
<LORD> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

<dastrdlyW> hahahaha
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> 0G1 kills flash
<sixthgate> I KNOW!!!! how did i not SEE that!!!!
<SuperBrony64> Flash isn't happy with you today. Did you forget the sacrifice?!
<Rainbow-Dash> Flash really hates you Prince-Dari, mine almost never crashes
<bernd> oh, i did'nt know that
<RobotPinkie> Great song
<Flutteryay> Unless of course I go full Cupcakes in the process
<Luna> 07Dari
<Luna> 07get ABP
<Stonegaze> Holy shit, a pony in my well!
<mib_hokxu1> the human looks like a human applejack
<RAWRity> really, I don't expect the movie to be TOO unbearable. At least it's not "The Princes Promenade"
<prince-dari> Pretty sure I did download it.
<Rainbow-Dash> The orange pony with her is applejack.
<Happy-Kah> lolol she does!
<Jon> Don't play with vital airbubbles like that!
<sixthgate> right as she said Nightmare moon it shows her reflection in the hourglass
<EspyLacopa> shoo be doo
<Luna> 07hmm which browser are you using atm?
<Luna> 07chrome?
<sixthgate> thats so freaky!!!! *shivers*
<Flutteryay> Be glad it's just G1 and not G3 or worse... G3.5
<mib_hokxu1> firefly
<IrOnLoRe> I didn't even know gen 1 existed until now, an i am glad. No offense to you ponies out there.
<LanceArrow> SHUSH
<Flutteryay> Firefly was awesome. I'll give G1 that.
<LanceArrow> G3.5 WAS NEVER MADE
<RAWRity> no, it do not believe in magic!
<Jon> Ok...so g1 is mind crushing but not soul crushing
<prince-dari> I'll probably switch us over to our new chat system in about 5 minutes.
<prince-dari> So...
<Jon> so we got that.
<prince-dari> Get ready for that.
<sixthgate> so is discord like one of the original bad guys from one of the earlier pony seeries?
<prince-dari> :>
<mib_s7vje4> im 25 and what is this
*Luna is ready
<Rainbow-Dash> Firefly was RDs beta design.
<Rainbow-Dash> Rainbow Dash is based on her
<Rainbow-Dash> She has to be awesome
<Flutteryay> Yeah.
<RAWRity> already ready!
<Shinitai> G3.5 never happend! >.>
<SuperBrony64> G3.5 did happen.
<EspyLacopa> Has Megan tasted the Rainbow yet?
<sixthgate> 3.5?
<EspyLacopa> shoo be doo
<RAWRity> snititai I'm afraid it did
<SuperBrony64> Not for long though.
<LanceArrow> IT CANT SEE US IF WE CANT SEE IT
<Shinitai> I know v.v
<RobotPinkie> 3.5 is canon
<Flutteryay> Is RAINBOW DASH ALWAYS DRESSES IN STYLE G3 or G3.5?
<Jigglysaint> 3.5, uh
<Jigglysaint> ug
<sixthgate> canon?
<Jon> ....lots of pink credits.
<RobotPinkie> 3.5, Flutteryay
<Jigglysaint> 3.5 needs to be shot out of a cannon
<RAWRity> sixthegate look up "Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel Adventure"
<Jigglysaint> both actually
<Flutteryay> Oh god
<ntonio9> samurai jack
<mib_s7vje4> can somepony describe all the generation quickly?
<Jon> ...Oh god jack.
<Happy-Kah> sam jack
<Stonegaze> Oh snap! Samurai Jack was da shit!
<sixthgate> okai ill look it up
<Happy-Kah> lololol
<LanceArrow> Here's all you need to know about 3.5:
<IrOnLoRe> Heck yeah, Samarai jack.
<Jon> Magic apple sword.
<LanceArrow> don't watch it
<LanceArrow> ever
<Jon> Yes.
<Happy-Kah> sam applejack
<RAWRity> anon: G1 flat characters but fun villains
<fgsfds> but a silly pony wielding a magic apple...
<Jigglysaint> what really bugs me about 3.5 is that they replaced the cookies that sweetie belle made, in the opening, and replaced it with fruit
<mib_hokxu1> more like samurai applejack
<RandomExtra> I don't think that G2 even had a show (although I could be wrong on that)
<SuperBrony64> G1: Great, but old. G2, Better looking, but more girlish. G3, New design, crap stories. G4, BEST EVER!
<Jon> Heres what you need to know about Samurai jack
<Jigglysaint> a lame attempt to ban all kinds of sugary stuff
<Jon> Watch all of it.
<Nyst> A pony show with a sword at all sounds pretty wild. Even if it is an apple sword. Do they stab anyone with it?
<RAWRity> G2 stupid, silly stuff
<Jigglysaint> thank goodness that Pinkie Pie is a sugar fiend
<RobotPinkie> Applejack always dresses in samurai outfits from feudal Japan
<prince-dari> Yeah.
<EspyLacopa> G1 had the SMOOZE!
<RAWRity> G3 Lowest common denominator shit that spoke down to it s viewers
<mib_hokxu1> G4: BEST DAY EVER
<SuperBrony64> You can't stop THE SMOOZE!
<EspyLacopa> http://mylittlewiki.org/w/images/9/9b/Untitled-10.jpg
<Stonegaze> Smooze
<Jigglysaint> G2, followed by G3 and 3.5 and Newborn Cuties
<RAWRity> G3.5 somehow DUMBER than G3.
<Stonegaze> ?
<Jigglysaint> on the list for worst
<Nyst> The Smooze was an awesome bad guy
<Jon> ...*Tilts head*Whats this...
<Jigglysaint> but G2 is the least watching for me
<SuperBrony64> Rainbow Dash was the fashion pony.
<RAWRity> G3.6 NEWBORN PONIES. nuff said
<Jon> Put all my stat points into STR?
<mib_s7vje4> what's the difference between G3 and G3.5?
<chedduhr> lol this is funny
<Jigglysaint> mainly because I can GET the stupid kiddie stuff, but I can't stand the teen girlie talk
<FlaschenJoe11> Rainbow Dash always dresses in Style
<Rainbow-Dash> What about 4.5..?
<FlaschenJoe11> lol
<Jigglysaint> G3.5 the ponies are, um
<mib_hokxu1> @anon G.5 is worse
<Jigglysaint> worse looking
<RAWRity> 3.5 is called "chibi ponies" as they changed the art style to make them look "cuter"
<Jon> These are perfect lessons.
<mib_hokxu1> *G3.5*
<Zephirdd> hey guys guys hey
<Zephirdd> I'll toss in an image
<Luna> 07https://adblockplus.org/en/
<Zephirdd> its a riddle
<Zephirdd> http://capinaremos.com/files/2011/09/nao_tem_dica_no_nome_RA.jpg
<LanceArrow> really?
<Melody> hello there
<Jigglysaint> you know what g.3.5 needs?
<Rainbow-Dash> If there is a G4.5 or G5, I wonder if it will still be good
<Zephirdd> Tell me what it is
<Nyst> Isn't a pony already a chibi horse?
<EspyLacopa> Blasphemer. Nothing is cuter than G4 Applebloom.
<Jigglysaint> pony tits
<LanceArrow> usually, 3.5 is just called 'crap'
<EspyLacopa> Or G4 filly Luna.
<ntonio9> Pacman
<Jigglysaint> newborn cuties though is worse
<Zephirdd> damn right ntonio9 :P
<Jigglysaint> art and content
<Zephirdd> got me a full minute to realize
<Nyst> An actual horse must look like a freaking viking to these ponies.
<EspyLacopa> ...What if they did a spinoff of FiM, covering Celestia and Luna's childhood?
<RAWRity> for a good recap of the non-FIM generations, check out this: http://miburl.com/HDqnAC
<Jon> Or in the current day
<sixthgate> ok....who told me to watch "Pinkie Pie's Ferris Wheel Adventure"
<mib_hokxu1> nothing is cuter than fluttershy!
<RAWRity> espylacopa that would be interesting, but I think it would work best as a mini-series/TV specail
<mib_s7vje4> gosh, it's that guy. i hate the guy.
<Jon> What your country can steal from itself.
<RAWRity> sixthgate that'd be me
<gentlecolt> g5 will probably be bad because lauren faust wont be working on it
<sixthgate> WHAT THE FUDGE DID I JUST WATCH?!?!
<Zephirdd> EspyLacopa you mean like that?
<Zephirdd> http://imgur.com/l5LXx
<Zephirdd> I really want to know the artist of that img
<Nyst> If the art, setting, names etc stay the same, it won't be G5 will it?
<RAWRity> sixthgate G 3.5
<Zephirdd> >_>
<sixthgate> RAWRity......
<Coolblue> Is the thing off air?
<EspyLacopa> I make it a point to not clickie the shortened URLs.
<bernd> omg pokemon and ponies
<ValtheJean> 2,14 PONYMON
<sixthgate> It never hapend
<RAWRity> u mad bro?
<sixthgate> EVER
<Zephirdd> oh
<Zephirdd> its on imgur
<Zephirdd> ...
<Nyst> Also, my money on when this peters out is that they'll make a G4.5 where they do the same, just with
<RobotPinkie> I dunno, G1-G3 are pretty similar visually
<Coolblue> for anybody else?
<Zephirdd> hang on
<SuperBrony64> You're watchin' My Little Pony?? SO?!
<Nyst> 3D CGI models
<Coolblue> oh
<sixthgate> TT-TT
<Zephirdd> http://i.imgur.com/l5LXx.jpg
<Zephirdd> direct link
<sixthgate> IM sad bro
<Coolblue> well, shit
<SuperBrony64> Zephirdd: That image is all kinds of awesome.
<RAWRity> Robotpinkie actually G3 is noticeably "shinier" than the others
<Jon> So...whats the request chat again?
<Coolblue> That's awesome
<Zephirdd> I just wished I knew the artist
<Zephirdd> #Vinyl_Scratch
<sixthgate> yeah i noticed that....
<Zephirdd> or Vynil_Scratch
<Zephirdd> dunno how you write it
<SuperBrony64> That's right.
<RobotPinkie> RAWRity: So you'd say they're not similar to G2 and G1 visually?
<Luna> 07We are not taking requests at this point :)
<Luna> 07this is just our playlist
<RandomExtra> I just realized that we had 127 people. During the preshow...:O
<Zephirdd> G2 didnt exist on TV afaik
<Jon> Just curious for later.
<Zephirdd> it was just toys
<prince-dari> Fuck
<EspyLacopa> RandomExtra: Yea, just imagine how many there'll be for the main stream
<prince-dari> Have to open flash again.
<TreyLove> Hey thar everypony
<prince-dari> Incoming derpage
<TreyLove> hm...
*Luna is ready
<TreyLove> it
<Luna> 07hey TreyLove
<TreyLove> is showtime but the broadcast is offline?
<sixthgate> Hey thar TreyLove!
*Zephirdd tacklehugs Luna
<RAWRity> robotpinkie yes and no. They've similar in the design of the ponies, but as they were mostly computer animated, it had a very different look to it, being more glossy and vibrant with the colors
<ValtheJean> 2,14 what URL are you using treylove?
*LORD is eating soup
<WhatPayne> But when Luna, when???
<prince-dari> TreyLove: Make sure you're on www.bronystate.net
<TreyLove> I'm back.
<RandomExtra> ... The chat speed...:O. This'll be fun.
<TreyLove> For a little bit, anyway.
<TreyLove> hrm. dinkypage.com
<Coolblue> Yeah, I heard the site was doing movie night in celebration of Season 2
*LORD considers the possibility of him drinking soup
<TreyLove> brb then
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we always have movie nights
<prince-dari> Shall I redirect dinkypage and co.cc to .net or what?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but
<ValtheJean> 2,14 this week, we're streaming all of S1 after the movies in honor of S2
<RAWRity> i'd say yes dari
<RobotPinkie> Okay, I still think they look similar enough. G3.5 was a pretty radical departure visually
<Coolblue> cool
<RandomExtra> Hmmm... Since Dinkypage still has Veemi, I say that it'd be a good idea.
<Zephirdd> redirect them
<Jigglysaint> okay
<Zephirdd> why not
<Zephirdd> :\
<Coolblue> Anyone wanna play Super Smash Bros. Brawl online?
<prince-dari> Ok.
<Zephirdd> a lot of people have the wrong addresses
<TreyLove> is audio going to be off during streaming?
<Coolblue> I got nothing better to do
<TreyLove> as in not lining up?
*prince-dari adds it to his epic shit-long list of things to do
<sixthgate> well im gone everypony! see u tonight if able!
<RobotPinkie> later, sixthgate
<Jon> So...We have dr.horrible my little pony but not dr steel my little pony?Just asking.
<TreyLove> What time does the super fantastic fantastic fantasm of fantastic fantasticness begin?
<RAWRity> robotpinkie well compare http://www.kimsites.net/dreamvalley/media/tales.jpg
<ValtheJean> 2,14 7PM EST is when the movies start
<RAWRity> to http://www.myfreewallpapers.net/cartoons/wallpapers/my-little-pony-princess-promenade.jpg
<Coolblue> God damn I hate keyboard characters
<chedduhr> well since I put the popcorn in the microwave too long and burned it, I'll just settle for a sammich during the program C:
<Luna> 07oh dear god RAWRity
<Jon> When does the offical preshow start?
<TreyLove> so 6 my time.
<MightyMatrix> 0I heard it started at 2pm est
<Jon> 2 right?

<RobotPinkie> Yeah, they're much shinier
<Jigglysaint> so yeah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 2PM est is for saturday
<Jigglysaint> perhaps I should somehow tell people to watch out for Sunday
<Coolblue> I hate keyboard shortcuts
<prince-dari> We need more WOAH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-OH-AH-OH-OH-OH-OH! in our playlist
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Fridays are 7PM, Saturdays are 2PM
<MightyMatrix> 0oh
<TreyLove> I'll see if I can figure out how to connect my computer to my tv.
<Jigglysaint> to see if Treehouse will indeed be running them out of order
<TreyLove> then play ponies on my tv all night long.
<Jon> Oh yeah...whoever posted the pics my internet is acting like a tardis with a paradox
<Jon> Thanks.
<Coolblue> Anyway, anyone who wants to add me to FC in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, my FC is 4556-2572-6786

<TreyLove> they're havinjg a tailgate party so I'm going to play all Texas Tech's stand tunes for them.
*RAWRity has the same opinion as valthejean

<FlutterGuy> Hey there GentleColts. What time is the new episode being streamed tomorrow?
<Spyrorocks> ...
<Shuttershy> I was told of a marathon but it seems to be rather offline.

<gentlecolt> I think her environment advantages would help.
<Saturn> 6I now have epic Twilight Sparkle powers.
<TreyLove> Anyways, this is generally not the music I'm into, so I'll check back later, guys.
<TreyLove> Put on my pony remixes while playing MC.
<prince-dari> And now you don't Saturn. :P
<Saturn> 0whoops, no colours then, i guess
<TreyLove> ...and then go to the retirement hom.e
<Webwyre> hello everypony <3

<gentlecolt> Personally what would be funny is
<Shuttershy> you say meh you are indeed a madman
<Kitter> preshow??
<Saturn> 0Princess Sparkle is best unicorn
<gentlecolt> If rainbow dash did the Filly Flash(er) on Starscream and he was all like "Whoa." and then BAM! right through the chest.

<Notorious_BIG_Mac> 0I love the MvC3 video Maximilian made with this song
<MeteorVenture> lauren would make one of the best drawfriends ever
<prince-dari> >preshow hasn't started yet

<DesertRose> is this being streamed from youtube?
<zaco_mobile> I did
<Luna> 07yes it is
<Crainy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGTuXIqf880
<Vergil> The fact that I like this show was even further clarified in the faust interview with EQ daily.
<Lyra> Dexter's Laboratory was the best
<ZakuPony> Test Test
<Crainy> or the cupcakes horrorcore rap!
<FlaschenJoe11> ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL
<RandomExtra> Are you taking requests Luna?
<banannagram> like fluttershy.whatever
<ZakuPony> WHOOO, i'M IN CHAT AGAIN

<Saturn> woo, i *love* this song!
<Luna> 07not yet

<chedduhr> there's a music vid for this? YEAH
<Nyst> I love how we're all basically watching someone else watch youtubes here.
<DesertRose> :|
<Jigglysaint> okay that's not it
<Vergil> I was like "This now makes perfect sense to me."
<Jigglysaint> I am getting something totally different
<LunaTheForgotten> Dexter was awesome, and so was Johnny Bravo, and Courage the Cowardly Dog
<ZakuPony> Could somepony tell me if there's a limit for this stream?
<Crainy> lawl rawl
<Luna> 07there is no limit
<chedduhr> .......................tell me this isn't a twiluna vid?
<ZakuPony> Brilliant
<ValtheJean> 2,14 limit? no. there can be as many people as there are bronies :P
<mib_hvmeo3> DAMNIT SEAON 2 WHY U NO COME QUICKER
<Andrevus> oh god Nightmare Mode.the first time i actually can swallow watching this one
<MeteorVenture2> is youtube not loading fast enough for the streamer? cause i think i'm catching all of the video but it's choppy.. and it seems to play at a normal speed
<Six> Normally I micspam pony songs on tf2, so feels nice not having to send it this time :P
<Jon> ...1.2 gigaviewers?
<Sumica_2> Wait Luna is a "reaper"?
<chedduhr> LAGS
<Saturn> i used to sing this in the shower when i was on an internship in germany
<Kabaka> zaco_mobile: is a reason for disconnection/no connection given? Like timeout or something?
<Giadrome> I hope there won't be any lags tomorrow :/
<Crainy> LAAAAAG
<ZakuPony> I wonder if that's why there's lag
<Crainy> make it stop!
<ZakuPony> Or does my connection just suck?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the lag is because of dari's ISP
<Kitter> Luna: no limit.. oh.. oh my... I'm just thinking about what will happen when 10000 people show up
<Saturn> my flatmate asked me waht i was singing (my shower singing was kinda infamous in the flat)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we're switching streamers in a second
<Saturn> so i had to explain ponies to her
<mib_ocxusq> sorry has blade runner been on or am i early?
<FlaschenJoe11> Saturn how did you like germany?
<Jon> Wait who controls the stream?
<Liferake> Internet service provider = ISP?
<Jon> Who controls the horizontal?
<Captain> this is lagging becaue someone is donwloading piracy movies
<DesertRose> I dont think its the stream lagging, seems to be the youtube buffer thats the problem
<Jon> Who controls the vertical?
<Six> And te vertical?
<LunaTheForgotten> Doctor, the lag has come back.
<Meteor> ARGH
<zaco_mobile> timing out
<Saturn> she was amused, but thought i was silly and, to her credit, tried the show, but didn't like it
<Saturn> FlaschenJoe11: zomg, i loved it
<prince-dari> Please, stop talking about the lag, it'll stop in a couple minutes.
<Jigglysaint> okay who can see the stream and who can't
<Saturn> FlaschenJoe11: i wish i lived there
<Jon> Doctor do you hear it?
<Saturn> it's so much nicer than the UK
*LunaTheForgotten goes to get an Arizona Tea
<Six> I can see it :P
<mib_hvmeo3> I WUV FWUTTERSHY
<Jon> The sound of beeps?
<Gig> 15Well, considered the amount of people on this stream, and the average upload speed of an average guy, it's almost a miracle we don't have MORE lag xD
<IrOnLoRe> The lag, isn't that bad for me.
<ZakuPony> The lag isn't that bad. Just undeniably noticeable.
<Vergil> Stephen Magnet!
<FlaschenJoe11> Saturn i wish we already had this show
<Saturn> Gig: it's being CDN'd
<Kabaka> zaco_mobile: You could try increasing the timeout time. I see some Verizon users had to do that. There are mixed claims of Verizon blocking all common IRC ports or filtering the traffic somehow. I'm not really sure though.
<ValtheJean> 2,15 gig: first off no colors :P. Secondly lag is unrelated to the people that show. It only compares the streamer's upload speed to your download speed
<tiktalik> mib_ocxusq, blade runner is later
<Jigglysaint> wait what?
<Kitter> Jon: doctor who?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the number of people only effects chat speed
<Jigglysaint> you mean it won't work for Canadians?
<DesertRose> LUNA

<FlaschenJoe11> Doctor Whooves please

<chedduhr> is this nightmare mode?
<DesertRose> i want that background
<Aloe> 6Luna is magical~
*LunaTheForgotten comes back with a gallon of green tea

<ThaddeusC> Any idea why I'm watching Megas instead of ponies?
<Crainy> i shout it out everywhere
<Jukashi> I think squee is the wrong onomatopaia for that sound

*ValtheJean squees with excitement
<Luna> 07after the next one
<CMC> makes being a brony 20% cooler
<MrPoniator_> Premiere is decent, but Adobe screws up with Flash especially
<WhatPayne> MyBodyIsReady: what about photoshop cs5?
<Hexalan> it shows the same eosode happening 9:00-9:30 and 9:30-10:00
<Zed> So... we have a theme song now?

<Luna> 07nope
<TheTrixiest> If i hadn't heard this so many times i would be ok with it
<Gig> 0It won't
<Puppy> this song isn't even japanese...
<Andrevus> Lag is one thing but jumping all over the video?
<Gig> 0'cause the server is dispatching it
<Gig> 0Long story made short
<AllisZero> After Effects is probably a poor choice for that, so I'd say Flash is your best choice
<Notorious_BIG_Mac> 0I know Puppy, that's the worst part
<RobotPinkie> Nu Ã¤r vi hÃ¤r med Caramelldansen!
<Gig> 0He will only upload it once
