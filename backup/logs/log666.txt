<Crystaline_Shard> XD
<Barbetos|AtWork> <3 Dr. P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lF-nYZh_sM
<Barbetos|AtWork> Why did I stop listening to this stuff? Oh right. Ponies.
<Cades> hey
*Crystaline_Shard does not care for it.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Its funny that I don't even care about Fenech Solar, but I love the remixes made.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Soler*
<Barbetos|AtWork> It gets better around 2:40 Crystaline_Shard ?
*Crystaline_Shard listens to owl city fireflies.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh. Blargh. I can see our taste are polar opposites XD
<Crystaline_Shard> Barb if it sucks at the beginning why would I stick around ?
<Kimori_Breakfast> how goes?
*ofna01 sits on a cloud
<Crystaline_Shard> Nah I don't have any taste I find i song I might like it not one particular artist or anything
<ofna01> just because i can
<Crystaline_Shard> not one genre or anything.
<Crystaline_Shard> Lyerics make little sense but i like the music and beat.
*ASoftFluffyThing slaps the chat around a bit with a large trout
*Crystaline_Shard noms trout
<ofna01> :P
*Crystaline_Shard listens to Skillet Hero AMV DogDays.,
<Gold_Demona> I believe it was George Harrison who said "The words don't have to make sense. They just have to sound good together."
<Crystaline_Shard> Tru.
<Gold_Demona> Which explains a LOT of the songs he wrote. XD
<Crystaline_Shard> haha
<Crystaline_Shard> heres a really! goodo ne.
<Crystaline_Shard> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBzqOa9y02I&feature=BFa&list=PLF8D0137D95C6C611
<Crystaline_Shard> Tribute to gamers.
<Gold_Demona> That's really cool. =D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's why F
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: *a lot of gibberish song sound good :D
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM4iQn2Si-U
<Gold_Demona> Ever hear the Loco Roco theme song? The song is LITERALLY in gibberish.
<Gold_Demona> No real words whatsoever
<MadSurge> Crystaline_Shard: the anime? I just saw a couple guys riffing on it :D
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: just accents
<Gold_Demona> But the song is catchy is all hell
<Gold_Demona> I know the damn thing by heart. ._.
<Crystaline_Shard> MadSurge: you mean DogDays? yeahg I enjoyed it if just for the animation.
<MadSurge> I made my own lyrics to the Blue Locoroco's song :D
<MadSurge> Crystaline_Shard: Magical Ninja Warriors with animal people :D
*Crystaline_Shard listens to the hoosiers Cops and Robbers.
<Crystaline_Shard> Who cares it's fun to watch if nothing else.
<Crystaline_Shard> :D
<MadSurge> Crystaline_Shard: but why do they become cat balls
<MadSurge> To incapacitate them without killing them?
<Crystaline_Shard> They don't die on the battle feild their wars are actually large scale games. you pay some money to enter you do you country proud and if you do good you get more then you spent the rest of the money goes to projects like hospitals and such it's their way of taxing you.
<Crystaline_Shard> The war areas are under magic protection
<Crystaline_Shard> Though humans are excluded from this protection so they can bleed.
<Crystaline_Shard> Because the magic wasin't designed to protect beings fro manother world
<Crystaline_Shard> It's like tag turning into a puff ball means your out of the game till medics can heal you or something.
*ASoftFluffyThing sways to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CSXzPaTgqo&hd=1
<Barbetos|AtWork> C418 <3
<Barbetos|AtWork> I need to buy those albums
<MadSurge> Crystaline_Shard: that's a convoluted way though to make war non-lethal :D
<Crystaline_Shard> each "kill" net's that side a point or more they are totaled up the end and that's how the admisson money is split up.
<Crystaline_Shard> MadSurge: but they arin't actually war it's a game to them.
<Crystaline_Shard> The last few episodes get serious and show what happens off protected ground
<Crystaline_Shard> and why the magic fox ninja's need a damn nerf :/
<MadSurge> :D
<Crystaline_Shard> I actually made a WH40K faction based on them.
<Crystaline_Shard> It failed epicly of course but it was fun trying.
<MadSurge> Crystaline_Shard: at least there's actual violence :D
<Crystaline_Shard> Especially the last few wpisodes. the fucking anime takes a bloody right turn and has no regrets about it.
<MadSurge> Crystaline_Shard: so I take you like anime :D
<Crystaline_Shard> Also it's fun watching them wail on each other with out the useual omg war it's stupid but i need to fight . FUCK YOUR DOUBLE STANDARDS TO EMO GIT GTFO!
<Crystaline_Shard> you*
<Crystaline_Shard> Yes I do.
<MadSurge> I enjoy it too occasionally
<Crystaline_Shard> You should hear me qoute Gundam in my ultraboy prime voice. :D
<MadSurge> Got some good suggestions?
*JRP2234 hugs mica
<MadSurge> Crystaline_Shard: I'LL KEEL YOU TO DEATH

<Dken2021> it's alsmost 11:30 where I am
<MadSurge> MaxTheBrony: we'll know for sure in these 4 weeks :D
<Gold_Demona> In Pacific time it is. Here in Eastern time, it's 12:30
<MaxTheBrony> :) yey
<Dken2021> we still have like 23(?) days left for that announcement
<MadSurge> ^
<MadSurge> Breaking announcement: Season 3 will feature PONIES
<Alchemist> did anyone see the efr interview with the VA of Zecora?
<Dken2021> no, kinda forgot
<MadSurge> Alchemist: what about it? (I didn't)
<Kandarihu> It's 9:29 in PDT
<Kandarihu> That's the time zone where California is in
<Alchemist> I havent seen it either, was just wondering how is it. I'm not especially fond of efr interviews.
<Alchemist> I've only seen the ones with Tabitha and Ashley Ball and they seemed a bit...forced. Especially the one with Ashley Ball.
<Lil_B> any Mother 3 Fans in here?
<Alchemist> I saw the interview with Tara Strong on Fat Man on Batman and it was not
<Dken2021> you're talkin to one <3
<Alchemist> even in the same ballpark
<Lil_B> Dken2021 Do you like the Mother 3 Soundtrack?
<MadSurge> Alchemist: Tara is very open with everyone it seems :D
<Kandarihu> I loved Mother 3
<Dken2021> yea, I did like the music in that game
<MadSurge> I didn't like it :|
<Dken2021> did like the green and red train music
<Lil_B> they made a very special kind of Music Rip for that game, to get the highest possible music quality XD
<Dken2021> where at?
<Lil_B> I'll give you the Link in a min
<MadSurge> Any swedish people here besides Wrek?
<ofna01> So i thought my throat might be hurting because of my tonsils, but its not near that area...
<Lil_B> they ripped the MIDI files and made a Soudnfont with all the music, and reapplied the sounds to the MIDI again afterwards, now they music has even better quality than the GBA Itself had and it's still all 100% tur to the source, (exept for the panning in some songs
<Alchemist> MadSurge: http://derpy.me/qSYP0
<Dken2021> Lil_B oh man, sounds excellent
<MadSurge> Alchemist: well, I guess not about EVERYTHING :D
<Alchemist> MadSurge: maybe she was just tired :D
<Lil_B> Dken2021 it is, I used the FLAC Torrent ... 2.3 GB of Music XD
<Dken2021> well there are like 250 tracks
<MadSurge> Alchemist: even like that, she's still good looking :3
<Lil_B> Dken2021 here is the link http://forum.starmen.net/forum/Games/Mother3/MOTHER-3-Ultimate-Music-Rip/
<Lil_B> Dken2021 250+ some unlisted

<Dken2021> ah thanks you Lil_B
<MadSurge> Alchemist: *pomf* O__O
<Barbetos|AtWork> In public too. The SHAME!! Oh the humility of being a pegasi. Or would it ponility?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ponility sounds sillyu
<Barbetos|AtWork> Annnddd I should really eat something. Even I think I am being weird, never a good sign.
<Alchemist> Barbetos|AtWork: you are not weird...yet

<Gold_Demona> Usually in videos like this, it's the lyrics. Or in this case, funny interpretations of the lyrics. :P
<Alchemist> comments on youtube are quite predictable now
<Gold_Demona> So?
<Wirisme> They have always been predictable
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: nothing to it, just saying.

<Millenium> Spongebob music...
<Wrek> 05SpadeMagnes[School]: probably
<Wrek> 05ask a lawyer
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School]: ask phoenix wright
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Because this "American Morgage" group smells of scam
<Kandarihu> Phoenix Wright is a defense atourney, not a prosecutor
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They just went up and took 35,000 dollars from my parent's retierment fund before the date they said to do it and more than was specified
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[School]: get miles edgeworth on the case
<Wrek> 05SpadeMagnes[School]: definetly a scam
<RaveBrony> ._.

<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<Unnr> Saturn, good answer
<MadSurge> Hey Shizuka! :$
<Kandarihu> I've noticed a near universal tendancy for something that is built up for a long period of time being subverted.
<VenHur> Hello Saturn and Shizuka!
<Panda|Drawing> Shizuka, hey... I have a present for you ^^
<Applejack2011> hi
<SpadeMagnes[School]> WoW has actual farming now
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates September 27th (Morning)
<Sonny> oh fod
<Sonny> i mean god
<Millenium> :D
<Applechip> prepare your body
<alexxm> so many scouts
<Sonny> rofl
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr! \o/
<Kakumy> Dem scouts!
*Saturn 08,01nuzzles Unnr
<Sonny> rofl
<Sonny> unamused rd
<Sonny> :p
<MadSurge> RD AND DERPY :D
<Millenium> TP2
<Unnr> Is anyone else ever creeped out by 3d rendered ponies?
<Sonny> nope
<Sonny> love em
<Meanwhile> Hello everyone.
<alexxm> i am Unnr
<Kakumy> Nope their even more cute
<Unnr> ohai Meanwhile
<alexxm> how are things Meanwhile
<MadSurge> Unnr: only the ones with tiny eyes
<Lil_B> ddamnit, the Source Pony Models are soo good >.<
<Kakumy> Meanwhile: Hello
<Lil_B> heya Meanwhile !
<Applejack2011> hello
<Unnr> Its something to do with how they are rendered... they really need a more cell shaded approach, to get that darker border you get with flat ponies
<Kandarihu> We can't call them GMod ponies anymore, since they work with SFM too
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Hai Captain McAwesomeFace
<Meanwhile> Forever a scout.
<Kakumy> Everyone is injured
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Fastest cap ever
<Meanwhile> Lo T.
<Lil_B> Unnr I actually like how they look in 3D like this, although having still a big boarder would be... interesting I think in SFM
<Meanwhile> Ded.
<Millenium> More TF2 Gameplay :(
<SpadeMagnes[School]> He wasted like 40 bullets
<Meanwhile> Bonk.
<Chrysalis> ohai Saturn
<Kandarihu> Unnr, the Source Engine might need to be updated to support something like that. But since Gaben is a brony, he might be happy to oblige. But it would require that Valve make a game that features it.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> did you see Schyther already ?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> TROLOLOLOL
<Kakumy> Wow... that spy is a troll
<Sonny> wtf xD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is that Dickshep?
<Meanwhile> Shepard needs to chill out.
<MadSurge> ^
<Meanwhile> I did not.
<Kakumy> Shepard frikin chill out man...
<Kandarihu> Shephard needs better rigging
<Meanwhile> :I
<MLP_Brovakiin> o.o
<Sonny> O_O
<Millenium> :D
<Kakumy> ROFL
<Applechip> uhhhh
<Sonny> °-°
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Wut
<MadSurge> :O
<Sonny> >_>
<Lil_B> ô_o
<Sonny> rofl
<Kakumy> ROFL
<Sonny> Hey whoever is streaming :D
<Meanwhile> Und dann chat was confused.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What does RAM stand for?
<Meanwhile> Really Angry Marsupials.
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[School], Random Access Memory
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the new champion in LoL is Schyther
<Applechip> Random Access Memory
<Dken2021> what the others said
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So what does RAM actually handel?
<Sonny> random attractive mom
<Kakumy> I wonder what Wrek oh...
<Meanwhile> Sounds...uninspired.
<Sonny> oh right
<Unnr> Kandarihu: It could be faked decently enough with a well tweaked colour map
<Sonny> >_>
<Kakumy> Video games more important :P
<Sonny> I mean Really attractive mom
<Sonny> :p
<Millenium> TF2! TF2! TF2!
<Sonny> :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is like a mix of rengar and udyr with pokemon on top
<Kakumy> It's Planet Side not TF2
<Millenium> I know.
<Applechip> SpadeMagnes[School]: It's essentially where program information is stored when you are actively using the program.
<ekips> oh Wrek's playing PS2? I'll hop in in a sec
<Kakumy> Then TF2... WITH PONIEZ :P
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[School], it's where the computer temporarily stores data as it's using and processing it. The more RAM there is, the more it can handle before lagging up like crazy
<Kakumy> WASABI!!!!
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Is there a way for me to decrease lag in WoW besides decreasing the settings?
<Millenium> brb
<ekips> if it's lag, you can't do much, if it's fps drop, buy a better pc
<Kandarihu> SpadeMagnes[School], close out of any big programs that you don't need.
<Kakumy> Oh...this song...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> the fps seems to drop when alot of shit is on screen
<Kakumy> Russian Pony :P
<Kandarihu> Well, time to pop into PSO2 for a sec
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Well I may get a new desktop soon...I hope
<Kakumy> Well I'm gonna watch YouTube now...
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No idea on the actual time when I will get it but I'm going to get one sometime
<Kakumy> bye guys
<alexxm> bye Kakumy
<SpadeMagnes[School]> FLY TO THE SUN
<Kandarihu> If I time out in 4 minutes, blame Game Guard
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I'll be back I have to go attend a class
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodbye SpadeMagnes[School]
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Instrumental Music: Captain PipSqueak / Painting Pegasi / Tavi and Scratch - The Encore
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I'll be back in a half hour or an hour
<SpadeMagnes[School]> maybe
<Kandarihu> Alright. I'm fine
<Sonny> gonna play some tf2
<Sonny> bye
<ekips> btw Wrek, you should check you video stream options, we only see a part of the game window
<Bronysith> what server and faction is Wrek playing on?
<ekips> Herse, NC
<Wrek> 05wait what ekips`
<Bronysith> d
<Wrek> 05ok let s see
<Wrek> 05restartign the thing
<ekips> much better now
<Bronysith> and suddenly sexiness
<Lil_B> Dat Spy Wallpaper
<Kandarihu> Wow. The month-long event PSO2 has going on now is WIERD
<Meanwhile> weird.
<Kandarihu> Right. Sorry. WEIRD
<Meanwhile> What is it?
<ASoftFluffyThing> What's going on?
<Kandarihu> Some sort of Moon Viewing festival or something. The central monument in the Shopping District has been replaced with a red-leafed tree.
<Kandarihu> And orbiting the top of the tree is a little moon with a rabbit on it holding a mochi-pounding hammer.
<Meanwhile> Well ok then.
<Kandarihu> And the music has been changed to something, well all I know for sure is that it sounds like traditional Japanese music.
<Kandarihu> And that traditional music plays in both maps of the Arks ship.
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<Kandarihu> Frankly, it's got this traditional feel to it, but it's still as overly dissonant as any other song in the PSO2 OST
<Sylandest> howdy GilDash :)
<MadSurge> Dat shrug :D
<MadSurge> Hello GilDash!!!
<Sylandest> am I right to assume that we're taken with the gameplay, thus no chatter? :D
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<GilDash> Nah, it's just dead chat. XD
<GilDash> I don't even know what's on the stream. Not got it open. :S
<MadSurge> I got games and Inception to look at!
<GilDash> Ohh, Inception! ^_^
<Sylandest> indeed
<Sylandest> good film
<Sylandest> as for me, im nomming on lunch, so i thought to come on and have some company instead of sheer quiet
<Meanwhile> Yfw it's quiet in here.
<Sylandest> ...and apparently, the desire for company is a bad thing to want...:$
<Bronysith> d
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Come on now, it's been quite on here often enough that my face is the same no matter what. XD
*Bronysith puts Meanwhile in a room with molestia and trixie
<MilkyWhiskers> What's the song?
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/Nkkl4.png
<MilkyWhiskers> It's classy!
<Bronysith> CLASSY
<Kandarihu> I guess the trilogy events we had this summer were meant to prevent the IRC from dying out like this.
<Meanwhile> More like, to have something to do in summer.
<Klumzeedragon> Why do I feel like we're listening to Jazzified Banjo Kazooie songs. :D
<Klumzeedragon> And good afternoon everypony! :)
<Meanwhile> Lo Klumzeedragon.
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek is best Pilot!
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello Klumzeedragon :)
<Bronysith> sounds like the trials from final fantasy 10
<Meanwhile> He said, as he crashed upside down into a rock.
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: Twas my point. ;)
<Meanwhile> Amusing, but I wouldn't want him flying my dropship >.>
<Klumzeedragon> And how is everyone so far today?
<PinkieSpice> I hear awesome music
<PinkieSpice> what is the name of that song??
<PinkieSpice> okay
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/GBGVA.jpg
<Bronysith> hi Shizuka
<PinkieSpice> trying to stay up as much as i can to have relatively normal sleeping time
<MLP_Brovakiin> Klumzeedragon: I am still using that teapot gun that pinkie gave me on borderlands! :D
<Klumzeedragon> No one knows, I suppose. xD Except for Wrek. And he's busy shooting things.
<PinkieSpice> FOR the love of celestia1 whats the name of this song!
<Meanwhile> Random Shizu pic, check.
<PinkieSpice> I WANT IT! NOWWWWWWWWW!
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, lol
<Shizuka> 13meanwhile complaining about pic, check
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Bronysith> awesome shizu come back....
<Bronysith> Check
<Meanwhile> I didn't complain, you've just gotten a bit predictable.
<Shizuka> 13so have you
<Bronysith> and Meanwhile being snarky...check
<RaveBrony> :D
<Meanwhile> Point taken.
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: Ha ha. :D I bet. It's a pretty awesome weapon.
<MLP_Brovakiin> It is Klumzeedragon, even at lever 30 :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> *level
<PinkieSpice> ;a;
<PinkieSpice> the song is over and i never got the name
<PinkieSpice> :'(
<PinkieSpice> this one also nice
<Klumzeedragon> Yeah, when Meanwhile posts a link, it's usually that moth, spider, or squidipus.
<Meanwhile> This sounds like one of those "X happens while I play unfitting music"
<RaveBrony> Indeed
<Klumzeedragon> PinkieSpice: I'd tell you if I knew. :D It seems only Wrek knows. And he's busy killing things.
<Meanwhile> Klumzeedragon: http://i.imgur.com/2W9XC.gif
<Bronysith> Shizuka sets shit on fire while Meanwhile plays unfitting music
<Chrysalis_> oh wow
<Chrysalis_> i just noticed the glasses
<Chrysalis_> they are awesome
<GilDash> Wow. Turn stream on and actual Wrek. :S
<PinkieSpice> such an interesting soundtrack
<PinkieSpice> =_=
<PinkieSpice> I wish aI hate a name
<PinkieSpice> Have*
<PinkieSpice> not hate
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: Is that an eel? :D
<Meanwhile> Frilled shark actually.
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: Damn. :P It was never that good for me. You should have gotten your own teapot by now.
<Bronysith> i want some fried shark
<Meanwhile> Shark isn't particularly interesting as a food. It's very watery.
<VenHur> I really wishs I can be an LPer, sadly, I don't have the programs needed...
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: The more I know! But it's not as weird as a blob fish.
<Meanwhile> True. http://i.imgur.com/IY5RO.png
<MLP_Brovakiin> I did, I gave it away as it wasn't as good, though I must say I now have a handgun that does 4199 damage :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> * Klumzeedragon
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: Exactly. :D Weird look bastards.
<Klumzeedragon> lookin*
<Vordox> <.<
<GilDash> What game is this anyway? :S
<Vordox> Errr... Wrek doesn't know "People who wear glasses during night/inside house are douchebags" XD
<Bronysith> wat if i ate super spicy food with extra spicy
<GilDash> Vordox: It's so you can't see his eyes. :P
<RaveBrony> lol
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: That sounds like a damn fine hand gun. I got one that does like 700 something x2.
<Meanwhile> I guess knives in this game are made of rubber.
<ekips> gah, my aim in this game is so bad...
<GilDash> No one going to tell me what game he's playing?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Klumzeedragon: Nice, we should play it again sometime :)
<Meanwhile> Planetside 2.
<Klumzeedragon> GilDash: Planetside. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: borderlands 2
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Thank you.
<twilight_sprinkle> oh, wooops
<Meanwhile> You're welcome.
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: I'm not that thick. :p
<VenHur> Why Wrek is wearing glasses? Because he is The One.
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: i wasnt joking, i dont really know what borderlands is so i forgot
<Klumzeedragon> Wrek always wears his glasses. :P
<RaveBrony> He was flying a ship earlier. and those look like aviators :D
<twilight_sprinkle> none of these fancy modern technicolor games could run on my laptop anyway
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: Of course man! Anytime you're on. :)
<GilDash> I've got a broken pair of aviators somewhere. All I really need is a new screw for them, but I keep forgetting to get them done.
<Meanwhile> Surely wearing those has got to be a detriment to aiming.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Klumzeedragon: I am on anytime after 4 pm gmt time as I have no scoial life :P
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<what> what
<what> hi
<RaveBrony> Hey, what
<GilDash> Meanwhile: Compensate with a bright screen?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya what
<what> :O
<what> 6_9 derp
<what> 6_9 whhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
<RaveBrony> =_(\
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/XJir7.png
<what> :);):D:P:(:$:O:|:'(:S:[<36_9>_><_<
<Meanwhile> Don't emote spam.
<RaveBrony> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> yay rainbows
<GilDash> Didn't see that coming... >_>
<Meanwhile> Does melee actually do anything in this game?
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: 4pm being what time in the US? :P
<what> 123134
<RaveBrony> ?
<what> what is this game
<twilight_sprinkle> Klumzeedragon: gmt, hence +at least 5
<Meanwhile> Planetside 2.
<RaveBrony> PLanetside 2
<what> o
<what> so erm
<twilight_sprinkle> what what?
<Meanwhile> Cheerio pip pip.
<what> whats your favirate (<---spelled wrong) pony
<RaveBrony> Lolwut
<MLP_Brovakiin> Klumzeedragon: I'll be if I know :P I will proabaly be on when you are on, put it that way :D
<Meanwhile> Pinkie Pie is best pony.
<RaveBrony> what: Rarity
<what> well there all good
<what> 6_9
<twilight_sprinkle> what: mine twiraightu sparkru
<RaveBrony> Meanwhile: Of all people, I didn't think You could spell 'Everypony' wrong ;)
<Klumzeedragon> Meanwhile: Fish and chips, wut wut?
<Meanwhile> RaveBrony: What do you mean? I spelled Pinkie Pie just fine.
<twilight_sprinkle> also "x is bets pony" is up to par with black alicorns
<twilight_sprinkle> *best
<RaveBrony> Meanwhile: Haha :D
<what> trollolololol
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: Alright man. :) I havent seen you on for a week. So I was curious.
<what> have you seen saberspark
<ASoftFluffyThing> And then chat goes into best pony discussion.
<Klumzeedragon> what: Of course.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Oh fair enough Klumzeedragon :)
<what> yeah
<what> 4 chan
<what> 3chan
<what> 2chan
<Meanwhile> There's never anything to discuss as far as best pony is concerned because inevitably someone says "Everypony is best pony :D" and then everyone else agrees with that.
<what> 1chan
<RaveBrony> inb4 kick
<what> go
<ASoftFluffyThing> But I thought everyone knew that Pinkie is best pony
<Reikim> BS, Meanwhile. Everyone IGNORES that and goes on bitching about who is best pony.
<Shizuka> 13hai rei
<Reikim> I know this from personal experience.
<Meanwhile> Rei what fandom do you think this is.
<Reikim> Also hi Shizu. And everyone else.
<what> mlp=asome
<RaveBrony> Because do to all the different opinion, there will Never be 1 pony that everyone finds to be the best :D
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: So unless you play offline, we need to play again. :P
<RaveBrony> *due to
<Reikim> Mean, which chat do you think you're in?
<Meanwhile> Not the same one you're thinking of apparently.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Klumzeedragon: I only play ofline if I am off of school :P
<Shizuka> 13what: I strongly suggest you familiarize yourself with our rules at http://www.bronystate.net/rules
<Chrysalis_> uh oh, the rules link is coming out
<twilight_sprinkle> oh, we had a rules page, whoda thunk it
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Reikim> The problem, Meanwhile, is that "everyone agreeing that everyone is best pony" implies either a) logic, or b) lack of butthurt.
<CK|Ded> Okay so. Does anyone happen to have a max-level character in WoW? I'm trying to get an idea what the approximate amount of experience is for a normal max-level quest.
<RaveBrony> Shizuka laying down the law up in here.
<what> hi
<Shizuka> 13aren't you supposed to reach max level in wow on your second day?
<Wirisme> Who's breaking rules?
<Wirisme> and how
<Meanwhile> Reikim you forget, this is the pony fandom. Love and tolerate is the motto for the generic.
<Klumzeedragon> Shizuka: Yes. Yes you are. If not on your first.
<Shizuka> 13that's what i thought
<alexxm> do we have a new guy?
<Reikim> And Meanwhile, you forget that despite being ponies, we are still an Internet fandom with the appropriate amounts of butthurt and whining.
<Shizuka> 13it's a feat that can only be managed by the most dedicated of grinders
<Klumzeedragon> Some people like to take baby steps.
<Klumzeedragon> :D
<RaveBrony> Oh hey, alexxm.
<alexxm> sup RaveBrony
<CK|Ded> I have no idea, I'm just trying to match it up with GW2's quest XP curve.
<Klumzeedragon> MLP_Brovakiin: Makes sense!
<what> this is the first time ive been on here :D
<Shizuka> 13played the ten day trial once, was bored to tears after three days of nothing but "go here kill ten x come back and talk to that guy"
<RaveBrony> We can tell ;)
<what> yep
<Shizuka> 13if wow has a story, they have it well hidden
<Meanwhile> Quite true Reikim, but more often than not I find chat in here tends to agree with itself because of the way the shows morals are interpreted.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: pvp is lotsa gun though, minus all the butthurt
<twilight_sprinkle> *fun
<Shizuka> 13can't stand pvp
<MLP_Brovakiin> Klumzeedragon: It stops people accusing me of bunking class :D
<RaveBrony> Shizuka: Its in the quests
<Reikim> Shizuka: You forgot "go here kill y until x z's drop and then come back to this guy"
<Meanwhile> Allow me to sum up PvP in WoW
<Reikim> True enough, Meanwhile. I concede/
<RaveBrony> Crying, lots of it ^
<what> bob>jeff
<Meanwhile> >Bubble Death and decay stun stun stun stun frost nova stun bubble lay on hands buble stun death grip totems stun stun stun frost shock stun
<LunasGuard> ello everypony
<Meanwhile> Did I mention stun?
<Shizuka> 13MMO pvp to me seems like it's inevitably guaranteed victory for the player who does nothing but pvp all day long
<RaveBrony> Ganking all around!
<what> hi
<alexxm> how are things LunasGuard
<Meanwhile> Namely because it is.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya LunasGuard
<twilight_sprinkle> there are several subcommunities. in this chat tthere arent many best pony arguments, on other sites there are
<Shizuka> 13at least in tf2, while exceedingly unlikely, you can still get hosed by a day one player
<Klumzeedragon> Turned from best pony discussion to best PVP stratedgy. HUMANITY!
<LunasGuard> very good alexxm
<Meanwhile> But nowadays in WoW the dedicated PvPers are generally kept in their own upper bracket.
<LunasGuard> how u doing MLP_Brovakiin
<Reikim> But Shizuka, then we get players like you, who are completely OP in their class and completely unstoppable.
<this> i
<Meanwhile> And the lower PvP is all about who rolled the right class when they started.
<Reikim> Where's the fairness there?
<this> hi
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good thanks LunasGuard, how about you?
<Meanwhile> Well Rei you stop sucking and learn to play.
<LunasGuard> great thanks 4 asking MLP_Brovakiin
<Meanwhile> I'd think of kinder words to phrase that with but I'm not in the mood to.
<Shizuka> 13silly rei i am quite stoppable
<CK|Ded> Shizu: Oddly enough, this is why I love GW2's WvW. >_>
<Shizuka> 13pyro vs heavy doesn't end well
<MLP_Brovakiin> Its fine LunasGuard :)
<Meanwhile> Anything vs heavy doesn't end well from the front.
<twilight_sprinkle> i liked the pvp system in wow until cata. it took practice and experience, and then it was quite fun
<CK|Ded> I wandered into it, and on day one, I straight up assassinated a few dozen people. >_>
<RaveBrony> I play Demoman.... Pyros are mean :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> never played cata so
<Reikim> Hold on, I forgot the :P on the end of my last sentence.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And I am back
<Meanwhile> To win at WoW pvp, roll a rogue or a frost mage.
<Klumzeedragon> You ricked him Wrek!
<RaveBrony> Lol
*ASoftFluffyThing prefers Engi because she can be lazy, upgrade, shoot people from the sentry and listen to her dispenser radio
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Meanwhile: is it safe to say Rogues are fucking OP in Pvp?
<RaveBrony> I would think so
<Meanwhile> Since I used to play a rogue, yeah you can say that.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They can stack shit loads of debuffs on you
<twilight_sprinkle> huh, i remember killing rogues very easily in wotlk as a pally
<Meanwhile> >Played pally in Wrath.
<RaveBrony> I played an Ele shammy. People hated me in PvP :D
<Meanwhile> Well I hate you now.
<twilight_sprinkle> >QQ pls
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I never got into Pvp
<RaveBrony> Nor did I
<Meanwhile> Go bubble hearth you ret git.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The matches got too bullshit
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Meanwhile: Guess what
<ASoftFluffyThing> And this is where I back into the corner
<Meanwhile> They removed bubble hearth?
<twilight_sprinkle> lol u mad. fyi i never bubble hearthed, but i would do it jsut for the sake of all the delicious rage
<twilight_sprinkle> i just did bubble+rocket boots
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Blizz made a glyph that increases hearth speed by 50% when you use divine shield
<RaveBrony> AV is best BG!! >_>
<twilight_sprinkle> then i came big and kileld everyone
<Meanwhile> What.
<CrazyCherry> Who be stremin'?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> No joke
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Theres a actual glyph that does that
<Klumzeedragon> CrazyCherry: Wrek be streamin.
<Meanwhile> They...they added...that...the...
<Meanwhile> I don't even.
<CrazyCherry> Wrek: Hejsan!
<twilight_sprinkle> hahaha
<Chrysalis_> Wrek be tired
<twilight_sprinkle> blizzard trolled you
<Chrysalis_> oh wow
<Chrysalis_> i just noticed
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Meanwhile: http://mop.wowhead.com/spell=115933/glyph-of-righteous-retreat
<Chrysalis_> thats an AWESOME desktop
<Meanwhile> Why would you make bubble hearthing a legitimate thing.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> BEHOLD
<twilight_sprinkle> haaaahahahahahaha
<SpadeMagnes[School]> AND DISPAIR
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wut... just got a torchlight gift copy
<Meanwhile> It was bad enough when you had pallies running away like little girls
<twilight_sprinkle> pally is best class lololo
<twilight_sprinkle> oh please
<Meanwhile> But encouraging them to do so? that's just weird, especially for blizz.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I never used it to be honest
<twilight_sprinkle> like wussy rogues running away are better
<RaveBrony> :o
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also trying to kill as a Holy paladin sucks
<Bronysith> CASTLE CRASHERS
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I no longer have Cosencrate or exorcism
<twilight_sprinkle> and i never used it either. i did bubble+rocket boots though
<Meanwhile> I used to love rocket boots.
<Klumzeedragon> Dat Lyra Steam Icon.
<Discord-Drocsid> hey hey hey Discord is here t play
<SpadeMagnes[School]> All I have for damage spells are Divine strike, holy shock, and jugement
<twilight_sprinkle> all the people who rage over pallies running away are just butthurt cuz they cant kill them. as if any sane player would stick around to get killed
<twilight_sprinkle> *wouldnt
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I quit being engi before MoP launched
<twilight_sprinkle> *no wait, would
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Engi had shit worth keeping it for and alot of it kept malfunctioning
<twilight_sprinkle> i sure forget what i write quickly
<Meanwhile> I always hated PvP tbh.
<Meanwhile> I only played PvE at a high level.
<Bronysith> deliciuos bag
<RAWRity> bonjour
<Chrysalis_> Ohai RAWRity
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Farming in Wow is interesting to say the least
<Chrysalis_> not seen you in a while
*Bronysith throws RAWRity off a 10 story window
<alexxm> how are things RAWRity
<Bronysith> hi RAWRity
<ASoftFluffyThing> All this talk about WoW....
<SpadeMagnes[School]> HAh

<RaveBrony> Dat login....wut
<Sylandest> mother bucker, he's playing WoW
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'll be on Gaia Online...probably...if you need me
<Sylandest> im in love
<Meanwhile> Pfft. Und dann WoW was on stream.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What realm are you guys on?
<RaveBrony> Yep
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I am In Cairne
<RAWRity> ASoftFluffyThing: Gaia? you poor son of a bitch
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Name is Vandoll the Pally
<Meanwhile> Urgh, I'm being haunted by nostalgia.
<Sylandest> Anvilmar here
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity: I haven't been on there in 5 years
<twilight_sprinkle> mists of Panda|Drawing ria
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You know what bothers me? Stormwind still hasent fucking fixed the statue
<RAWRity> Gaia is possibly the worst run site I've ever seen.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> And what happened to his hotbar?
<LunasGuard> dat twilight
<RaveBrony> Mmmm, dat mount
<Meanwhile> Stormwind hasn't fixed fucking anything.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I don't get the appeal behind WoW, honestly. I really don't.
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle XD
<twilight_sprinkle> hai Panda|Drawing :3
<RaveBrony> I ONLY reason I wanted MoP....was take Garrosh's damn head!! :[
<RaveBrony> *was to
<GilDash> Panda|Drawing: Oh, there you are. XD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Garrosh is a dick
<Wirisme> never even played it, nows my chance to be edumacated
<RAWRity> I understand Wow's appeal as much as any other MMO
<Meanwhile> I liked Garrosh better when he was a whiny bitch in Nagrand.
<RaveBrony> Dafuq is that thing?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Does anyone think the Cross realm idea is total shit?
<ASoftFluffyThing> I've never even touched it. I see it in the store and roll my eyes at it
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I do
<LunasGuard> getting borderlands 2 on xbox tomorrow
<Panda|Drawing> hello twilight_sprinkle :3 how are you hun?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: now hes a whiny bitch in orgrimmar
<Klumzeedragon> LunasGuard: Wewt!
<RAWRity> >never touched the game
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So where the hell is Thrall in all of this?
<RAWRity> >says they don't understand the appeal
<Meanwhile> Now he's a whiny racist bitch in Org with bigorexia.
<RAWRity> >what
<Wrek> 05SpadeMagnes[School]: i dont
<LunasGuard> Klumzeedragon: /)
<Wrek> 05cause i see the intent and pontential, and doesnt whien about issues that are obviously bugs
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Drawfriend Stuff #578
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: ehh, screwed up my last math quiz. worst two quizzes are dropped, meaning i have to be careful on the next ones. what about you?
<RaveBrony> Yay, drawfriendstuff
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So can some one explain how the hell the Skyfire can still fly?
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity: With what money am I supposed to buy the thing, and what computer which require said money that I don't have?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It took a fucking beating in Dragon Soul
<Klumzeedragon> LunasGuard: (\ What class you pickin?
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle, ah, yeah, last night I bombed a test too >.< but meh, ill do better next time. I'm just drawing, as usual ^^
<RAWRity> ASoftFluffyThing: if you don't want to play it, fine. But don't say something sucks unless you've actually played it.
<Meanwhile> Dragon Soul set the Skyfire ON fire entirely nine times out of ten during the Heroic Blackhorn fight.
<RaveBrony> and then Wrek's Viking pony is in drawfriend stuff
<LunasGuard> Klumzeedragon: assassin
<Klumzeedragon> Look at that Wrek. You made drawfriend again. :D
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What type of creature class are the sha?
<Wrek> 05LIINK
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: what test?
<Meanwhile> Seriously did anyone elses Hc Blackfire encounter just set everything alight on every other attempt?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> My holy attacks WRECK EVERY ONE OF THEM
<Klumzeedragon> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/09/drawfriend-stuff-578.html
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle Social Psychology.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I wonder how huge the Sha of Fear is
<RaveBrony> Wrek: Last link from dari bot
<RAWRity> yup, Number 7
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The sha of doubt was pretty big
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: ah. ill probably take that eventually
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[School]: Probably not as huge as Al'akir.
<Meanwhile> Or Thunderaan.
<alexxm> how are you twilgiht_sprinkle
<Meanwhile> Or the Qiraji Colossi.
<Meanwhile> Or Maws.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> So Al akir is dead right?
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity: I didn't say that it sucks. I just said that I don't see the appeal behind it. Probably because when it came out, just about everyone was playing it. (And the small bit of jealousy I had for those who did have it and were having fun >.>)
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: my brother was at the opening of ahn qiraj
<Bronysith> interesting shit
<Klumzeedragon> LunasGuard: Awesome. :) I have an Assassin and a Commando
<Meanwhile> I still have the scepter in my bag.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: you opened it on your server?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> is it actualy possible to kill a elemental permamently?
<RAWRity> btw, ASoftFluffyThing I believe they offer a free trial if you want to cut your teeth on it.
<Meanwhile> Never did get the chance to actually use the stupid thing though.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: so you got the scepter, but didnt open the gates?
<twilight_sprinkle> nuu twilight vanquisher, kill him!
<Meanwhile> I finished the scepter quest during Wrath, so no.
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle O_o you will?
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: oh
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity: The trial is 30 days, right? I forgot how long it is.....plus I can't play it without a new mouse
<Panda|Drawing> ASoftFluffyThing 7 days
<LunasGuard> Klumzeedragon: sad that I didn't preorder
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Can some one explain why Wrek's bar is all weird?
<Meanwhile> I used to pray that the gate would bug and check on it every day.
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[School]: You ever hear of addons?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I only use DBM
<Panda|Drawing> O-o what the hell?
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: yeah. i need o take some boring general education classes like history,english and stuff. but psychology and philosophy should be interesting
<Meanwhile> Pfft, only use DBM.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Im not kidding
<MadSurge> Inception is weird O__o
<Meanwhile> I had DBM, Omen, Recount, Bartender, and like 4 others I don't even know the name of.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have never had to use any other add ons,
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle, psychology is definitely interesting, hence why its my major ^^
<Klumzeedragon> LunasGuard: Aw. Still gonna buy the Mechromancer for 800 points?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Panda|Drawing: Aaaaaaaaaah not enough. I'll give it a shot. If it turns out I do like it and was bashing because of the popularity, I'll save up.
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: cool, what kind of stuff do you study there?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I'm not happy that Judgment is fucking usless now
<ASoftFluffyThing> Unfortunately, I tend to do that :<
<SpadeMagnes[School]> They took away the seal of insight mana regen for it
<LunasGuard> Klumzeedragon: yes
<Meanwhile> I wasn't happy when they removed our ability to craft our own poison.
<Meanwhile> Pointless? maybe, but it made it feel more interesting.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also alot of the gear I'm getting lacks spirit
<RAWRity> so guys
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Which is shit
<Kipkat07_USAF> THERES A BACON SHORTAGE!!!!!!!! :'(
<Meanwhile> Who cares.
<RAWRity> "Gangnam Style" is now the #2 song in the United States.
<Meanwhile> Bacon is meh anyway.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_USAF: aw sheet :O
<Kipkat07_USAF> Meanwhile: Dewhaaaaaaaaaaa
<SpadeMagnes[School]> What creature type are the sha?
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: im surprised its only №2. but on the bright side its dying out slowly
<SpadeMagnes[School]> the fuck is number one?
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: "dying out"? what weird, parralel universe are you living in?
<RAWRity> SpadeMagnes[School]: Maroon 5 song
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: ive already heard a lot of people say theyre tired of it
<ASoftFluffyThing> And then Party City commercial comes on. Reminding me to figure out what I'm going to be for Halloween
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I really need to build a Ret spec just for questing
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: doesn't mean it's dying out. It went from #11 to #2, beating out songs from hugely popular artists. It ain't going anywhere for a while.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I was SHIT at dps
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I could barely do 3K in cata :(
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle, well, quite a broad spectrum of subjects. I started off with Child and adolescent psych, psych and philosphy and a couple other hybrid fundemental classes ^^ quite fun if you ask me.
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: well it got famous very fast, but i think itll also become old news pretty fast. yeah itll be played a lot on the radio, but i dont think people will care for it much longer
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Only problem is... I dont know how to build my dps spec
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: is there a lot of biology involved?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I havent used a dps spec in months
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek I might not buy that Alpha squad thing for PS2. Every time I go to purchase it today, it sends me to my account options. I'm pretty much getting quite mad at the fact from all these errors that it is starting to put me off the game.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Does anyone have talent advice for making a Retrobution Paladin?
<Meanwhile> SpadeMagnes[School]: You should probably try Elitist Jerks.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I only plan on using it for questing
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle, of course :) but so far only when it directly effects cognitive ability. like inhereted traits and what not. other than that im not sure if i'll come across it much. cant be too sure though.
<twilight_sprinkle> wow, 32k hits. back in wotlk that was enough to kill almsot any player
<CK|Ded> Aha, there.
<twilight_sprinkle> in tbc to kill some three times
<CK|Ded> I've made my case. :3
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Has anyone encountered the Darkmoon rabbit yet?
<LunasGuard> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2we7mji4M1r5yhbco1_500.png
<Panda|Drawing> LunasGuard, so do I?
<DashWithRainbows> Did you say use a credit card or a debit card? I have to use a debit.
<CK|Ded> Had some dude arguing with me that GW2 is harder to level up in than WoW. So I, being a math teacher, gave him a math lesson and then cracked him across the jaw with a yardstick for giving me sass. :3
<Panda|Drawing> CK|Ded XD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It takes awhile just to get to 86
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: ah. cuz i remember going to a psychology olympiad(like a competition) without preparing or even knowing about it until 2 hours prior, i remember there were some biology-like quetions. i got 3rd place anyway :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: hell, i didnt even study psychology :D
<CK|Ded> Yeah, but WoW's XP curve gets really stupid at Lvl 86.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Its a good thing I have a shit load of cata gear I used for transmog
<LunasGuard> http://ponyconfessions.tumblr.com/ go confess ur sins
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle ^^ hehe awesome. what were you tested on? I mean, only 2 hours of preparation, I couldnt imagine you had a grasp of the many theoriums that are out there.
<Michael> howdy everypony, is this the new WoW?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I have enough for at least almost a full set
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: i didnt prepare for it either :D
<LunasGuard> Michael: ello
*Michael hugs LunasGuard
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Alas Poor Sock
<ASoftFluffyThing> And then I forgot what I was supposed to be doing.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I had it in my head before I drank the last of the orange juice
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: there werent many theorem quesitons though, it was mostly stuff like "what affects this type of judgement" or "what part of the brain controls this type of judgement" and "how to make these guys make peace". so pretty easy stuff, just needed logical thinking
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle xD that say more about the other contestants XD
<CK|Ded> Incidentally, while writing my case, I realized that GW2 is probably TOO easy to level in.
<SpadeMagnes[School]> It pisses me off none of the quest gear I got so far HAS NO SPIRIT
<Michael> is this the new WoW?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I fucking need Spirit!
<CK|Ded> You can run 15 events at Lvl 79 and poof, you're Lvl 80. >_>
<Maid_RainBow> Wrek is best DK
<Panda|Drawing> ah, twilight_sprinkle, seems mostly to do with social psychology. Wait until you start picking around the brains of those who suffer from schizophrenia and psychosis ;)
<Michael> well, dat was easy
<DashWithRainbows> brb
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: yeah, that id prefer to not think about <.<
<SpadeMagnes[School]> You need a lot of spirit now, but none of the fucking gear they give me has any
<CK|Ded> It's a ratio that's so absurd that WoW would need to give 320k XP per quest just to match the GW2 pace. Which makes me think it's really too easy to level in GW2. XD
<SpadeMagnes[School]> The shit
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: last term i had to change english classes because my teacher chose the class subject to be mental diseases. as if im gonna spend a term thinking about that :\
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle, meh, to each his own. I mean, I want to get a back ground in criminal justice as well, so studying dangerous mental conditions is something ill have to do.
<Lil_B> ... so, the FF6 OCRemix Kickstarter got over 45k , I cgot an e-Mail with the following messege:
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle, ah, well, it just interests me because I have close family members who suffer from it. and well... me now understanding it all just drove my curiosity :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: i know its rather interesting, but i dont like thinking about those things. makes me feel nutty too :P
<SpadeMagnes[School]> Also I have yet to upgrade my axe
<LunasGuard> do u play as a new race in the new WOW?
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I had the Axe of Purification for all of Cata
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle haha i know what you mean :)
<Michael> they added a new race?
<Lil_B> "We reached 45k , now every Pledger with 50$ or more will get a Copy of the FF7 Album too" included in the mail was a Picture of XZibit "Yo, I heard you like FF, so we put FF7 in your FF6 so you can FF7 while you FF6" ...
<mentallyeffedguy> hey hey hey!
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi mentallyeffedguy
<Michael> hai mentallyeffedguy
<Lil_B> hey mentallyeffedguy
<mentallyeffedguy> stay outta my shed! Michael Lil_B twilight_sprinkle !
<SpadeMagnes[School]> I think it may be time to upgrade my computer because the fps can tank on this sometimes
<alexxm> how are things mentallyeffedguy
<mentallyeffedguy> things are bad actually
<twilight_sprinkle> mentallyeffedguy: oh so we're always welcome in y our shed, got it
<twilight_sprinkle> *your
<LunasGuard> *cant stop thinking of south park WOW*
<mentallyeffedguy> is it WOW gameplay we are watching?
<Wirisme> That's the only knowledge I have of WOW :p
<twilight_sprinkle> yep
<Panda|Drawing> Odd... I expected to get a shit load of pings when pandaria came out. Heh, guess I misjudged XD
<CK|Ded> How do you kill that which has no life?
<mentallyeffedguy> everyone at my school says its nerdy, but what is the definition of "nerdy"?
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: well your name has |drawing right now, so :P
<Michael> all dat skill bars
<Panda|Drawing> twilight_sprinkle, the way my client is set up, it pings me on "panda"
<CK|Ded> "Nerdy" (noun): the art of being too much of a baws for normal people
<twilight_sprinkle> Panda|Drawing: ah, well idk then :P chat isnt very lively atm
<Wirisme> I'm watching someone play wow..
<Panda|Drawing> xD seems that way twilight_sprinkle :)
<GilDash> Panda|Drawing: It's only just come out. Give it some time and I'm sure you'll consider switiching. XD
<mentallyeffedguy> CK|Ded: oh, seems logic!
<mentallyeffedguy> playing games can be fun, i like COD its competitive and fun
<Kencolt> Server?
<mentallyeffedguy> but damn the hackers!
<CK|Ded> Dem bears
<CK|Ded> Da (panda) Bears

<LunasGuard> *flying kick*
<Meanwhile> CrimsonPhoenix: Why?
<mentallyeffedguy> nananana, those fists were fast as lightning!
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: uh how do you say that in english? oum no idea
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: hes trolling
<CrimsonPhoenix> I've noticed
<CrimsonPhoenix> good show
<Meanwhile> Untrue, I'm questioning everything.
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: you know fibunacci and stuff like that
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: hmm. integrals and derivatives?
<RaveBrony> Hey, Shizuka. Which is better for MvM? Degreaser or backburner?
<mentallyeffedguy> Meanwhile: its not untrue, its false
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: never heard of fibunacci
<Shizuka> 13personally i prefer degreaser for the switch time to detonator/ax
<CrimsonPhoenix> Meanwhile, actually that reminds me of kids
<RaveBrony> Ah, alright. Ty
<Shizuka> 13backburner probably works well but horribly nerfs your airblast ability because ammo
<CrimsonPhoenix> and their incredible curiosity
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: yeah, he was kinda awesome... like some egghead
<Meanwhile> If it's not true, then it's false, which is untrue...
<mentallyeffedguy> but false sounds cooler
<RaveBrony> Thats what I thot, lol. I have Rainblower for normal TF2 for the lulz.
<LunasGuard> mentallyeffedguy: just read ur name :D
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: whats your specialization?
<Meanwhile> Pfft, untrue sounds better.
<RaveBrony> I dont play pyro much, but I didnt want to scrap the better Item.
<ekips> Wrek looks so amused by playing this game
<mentallyeffedguy> LunasGuard: hope you got a laugh :D
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: pff specialisation... it would be accounting, but i hate that stuff
<LunasGuard> mentallyeffedguy: rocl
<Meanwhile> Why not do what I do and only scrap duplicates?
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: ah, so you study economy then?
<mentallyeffedguy> he knows the lyrics for the song to :P
<ekips> well, I'm off to bed, seeya

<Dark92Enigma> Eli oh good, i meant the boy genius
<twilight_sprinkle> ohh so thats where the red is from
<Nittany_Discord> Or lightning sparked by an ash cloud. That ash cloud is from a Chilean volcano.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: told you
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: and?
<Eli> Bronysith: i don't think that's something to make fun of...
<Dark92Enigma> A Chilean Volcano!?
<Dragonmatte> Before im killing myself for being bullied, i would kill the bully xD
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: how can you its chilean?
<MadSurge> FUCK guys, Inception is making me trip out D:
<Nittany_Discord> Seen it before.
<Kimori_Cookies> So...Gerpie...youve been a spyro fan for a long time?

<Eli> Brad[Laptop]: that's the moment it turns from fandom to obsession
<Brad[Laptop]> yep :P
<Dragonmatte> I think there are 2 pony references in MoP
<something> were do i get it
<Dragonmatte> Maybe moar
<MadSurge> something: google "desktop ponies" :)

<Eli> and i should be in bed. you're really hard to get away from, you know that?
<something> brb
<MadSurge> Eli: IKR
<Gerpie> rping as well?
<Nittany_Discord> It's the light from the lightning flashes reflecting off of the ash.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/5Es9e.jpg
<Dragonmatte> One does not simply kill the metall
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Eli: I know that feel
<Dark92Enigma> for the most part, my sarcastic behaviour is being caused by either my mom's hostility, or my dad's negativity.......
<twilight_sprinkle> wow
<Eli> AJIsAwesome|Tired: well, you look tired :3
<Bronysith> ohohoh the things i find in /r/wtf
<twilight_sprinkle> who knew ashes were so reflective
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Eli: :P
<MadSurge> Dragonmatte: in Borderlands 2's credits they mention Fluttershy :3
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Eli: Just got back from college classes.
<Dragonmatte> MadSurge: Yah, i've seen that too! :3

<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and I dont know if thats a guy or a chick.
<alexxm> bye Dark92Enigma
<Kimori_Cookies> What makes this show so good?
<Meanwhile> Master of Noodles.
<Meanwhile> Not the most imposing title in the world is it.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Bronysith: Reminds me of that one Garfield comic strip.
<MadSurge> Michael|Progamming: one of the programmers thanked her :3 bronies are everywhere!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> the writing, characters, animation
<Michael|Progamming> MadSurge: i saw it :D
<Gerpie> especially the characters
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> watch a few episodes and see if you like it.
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: welp. be happy the comic ends before the rape starts
<Kimori_Cookies> Its just a bunch of ponies right?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yep
<Kimori_Cookies> hmm...
<Kimori_Cookies> I'm starting to wonder if there is some collectable market for MLP
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its very big
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and lots of $$$ into it.
<Kimori_Cookies> Oh really? I might start researching it
<Millenium> xD
<Millenium> "Mothafucka." xD
<Kimori_Cookies> I always like getting collectables, wasnt expecting MLP to be one of em
<Gerpie> very big is an understatement
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But really, watch the first 5 episodes of season 1 and after that make a judgement if you like it or not.
<Kimori_Cookies> Is it like pokemon?
<Gerpie> it'll become bigger than pokemon soon
<Kimori_Cookies> Until I see MLP condoms ill believe it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> The first 2 episodes are a bit difficult to get through, they seem a little girly to some people
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I liked them though.
<LunasGuard> later everypony hope to see all of u friday
<Dark_Horst> bye
<Dovah> hello every pony and good bye LunasGuard
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> BYe, LunasGuard :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Im not heavily invested in mlp collectables.

<Barbetos|AtWork> something: so the website for desktop ponies did not re up its domain.
<Kimori_Cookies> Hopefully it didnt make things worse
<Barbetos|AtWork> They forgot to pay for their website, or did not care to do it
<Barbetos|AtWork> YOu gona have to hope some one uploads it for jo.
<Barbetos|AtWork> or something
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6614393344
<Dark_Horst> i'd like thosse mind bullets

*AJIsAwesome|Tired squeeks
<Kimori_Cookies> So just out of curiousity
<Kimori_Cookies> NOONE here has played skylanders yet?
<shibaru> I have
<Kimori_Cookies> Were you planning on getting the sequal?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Pony tags in Jet Set Radio. Yep. I need that game now.
<shibaru> Maybe
<ryaxnb> PSvita
<shibaru> I barely have any skylanders -sigh-
<Dark_Horst> i dont know why this song is so awesome... it jus is
<ryaxnb> it seems to me like manufactures make a goldmine off pony related references in games, tv shows, etc
<ryaxnb> haters hate but continue buying the game
<ryaxnb> publicity spreads, free pr
<ryaxnb> bronies buy the gmae for no reason other than "haz poniez"
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Barbetos|AtWork: Wait, what?
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Pony tags in JSR?
<ryaxnb> see my rationale for why it makes sense, AJIsAwesome|Tired
<RaveBrony> Damn, anyone got a spare sniper wep? Ill trade you backburner for it.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> That's it, I need to buy that game ASAP.
<Dark_Horst> what'S jet set radio?
<ryaxnb> there's no downside to mentioning ponies
<Gerpie> sorry for being quiet guys
<Gerpie> kinda working on stuff
<Kimori_Cookies> Its best to buy them when they are on sale :)
<ryaxnb> it's an automatic win for the publishers
<Kimori_Cookies> np Gerpie
<Meanwhile> I think I've got a shahansha kicking around.
<ryaxnb> free pr, bronies buy your games
<ryaxnb> publicity over game spreads amongst anti-brony, brony, and general net culture groups
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :) sup?
<ryaxnb> it's free marketing and free sales
<Dark_Horst> we get the idea, you're going in loops
<Barbetos|AtWork> Jet set radio has a custom tag designer.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Hi, Sketch_Toku_Brony :)
<flutter_spin> So let me get this straight. Wrek's picture got posted on EQD?
<ryaxnb> you're right.
<flutter_spin> That's kind of cool
<Dark_Horst> link?
<ryaxnb> on another topic, isn't jet set radio a sega game?
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Yep
<ryaxnb> i thought sega stopped making retail games other than osnic?
<flutter_spin> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/09/drawfriend-stuff-578.html #7
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> No, they just haven't made any other retail games beside SOnic in a long time.
<ryaxnb> ah
<ryaxnb> and football manager
<Moopy> Hey everypony sup wrek
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Sega needs some variety.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Hi, Moopy :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya Moopy
<ryaxnb> they're co-producing Bayonetta 2
<Dark_Horst> oh yeah, and wreks art popping up on eqd is no unusual
<ryaxnb> but nintendo is publishing
<Dark_Horst> they jus never ask before the post
<flutter_spin> Probably not unusual, but unusual for me to spot it
<Moopy> Hey wrek my step dad is playing wow to
<flutter_spin> I used to play WoW. Fun times, but my bro moved on.
<Moopy> where did he go?
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Same with CoD.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol i guess twilight doesnt like bees...:D http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=double+dragon+mlp#/d52ffg8
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> I wasn't obessed with it, but it was okay for the time being.
<ryaxnb> i play mario kart
<ryaxnb> 3ds is best dss
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> I needed something to play, and CoD filled the void.
<Gerpie> hey Spyrorocks? think you'd want to read a short I wrote?
<Gerpie> pony related ofc
<flutter_spin> I don't know. Got frustrated with the raid dismissals, among other horrible endgame problems
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02i liek CoD ^-^
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> DAT CHARMY
<ryaxnb> AJIsAwesome|Tired, i got a gaming pc recently
<flutter_spin> Otherwise I stuck with it until Wrath of the Lich King.
<Dark_Horst> AJIsAwesome|Tired: look up mechwarrior 4 mercenaries. it'S abandonware and thus free
<ryaxnb> been playing sonic generations
<ryaxnb> and sonic colors on wii
<flutter_spin> I think on and off for 5 years. My brother and I moved onto Lord of the Rings Online after that
<shibaru> I like ponies
<Meanwhile> Says everything anyone needs to know Super.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> ryaxnb: I love Generations. However I would've liked som DLC.
<ryaxnb> me too
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Meanwhile: :<
<Gerpie> Shibaru, brony? ;3
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome|Tired: lol ikr :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well thats a first...
<ryaxnb> really is a gorgeous game too
<ryaxnb> http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/sonic-generations/screenshots/gameShotId,558992/
<Kimori_Cookies> lol
<Meanwhile> I'm quite amused by being able to make you sad with only one sentence.
<Kimori_Cookies> I like cookies
<ryaxnb> the sonic engine is a beast
<SpadeMagnes[R]> That has to be the first Caramel/Twilight fic I ever saw...
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> What?
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[R]: i saw quite a few
<Moopy> Anypony in here plays WoW also besides wrek?
<Dark_Horst> never read em though
<flutter_spin> Is Reikim here? Aw. I wanted to tell him I looked at White Box fic
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What is going on with Wrek's bag?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Add on?
<alexxm> what it about flutter_spin
<flutter_spin> But I dislike sad/tragedy/dark fics like that one.
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[R]: probably
<ryaxnb> AJIsAwesome|Tired, which platform do you play generations on?
<Wrek> 05goan call it a night
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> ryaxnb: PS3.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Personally I dont see how add ons like those help
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Wrek: Sleep welL! :)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> It just looks messy to me
<ryaxnb> i play on PC
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> ryaxnb: Lucky.
<Wrek> 05of streaming
<ryaxnb> windows xp sp3/Core2Quad/Radeon7750
<MLP_Brovakiin> Goodnight Wrek
<Moopy> sleep tight wrek
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> ryaxnb: You can download modded levels.
<ASoftFluffyThing|Nap> Sleep well and thanks for the stream Wrek
<Wrek> 05not going to bed yet
<ryaxnb> sega's pc port engine is pretty awesome, incidentally
<Meanwhile> Thanks for streaming Wrek.
<Moopy> oh sorry
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does anyone else have that shield that looks like Deathwing's face?
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Wrek: Well you need to. :P
<ryaxnb> it supports running in 1080p/60fps/AA
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> anyone play the Double Dragon Neon demo? so awesome and full of 80's and mix-tape goodness :D
<ryaxnb> whereas the 360 game is 720p/30fps/noAA
<flutter_spin> alexxm: In a sense, it is about a story of someone who knows almost nothing. The google doc shows off some color text and suddenly he learns the truth about his past and the world around him
<ryaxnb> unfortunately, i need a faster computer to go all the way to 1080/60/AA
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03It's time!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Adventure time?
<ryaxnb> but if i did, it would look absolutely insanely good
<flutter_spin> alexxm: But the context of the story and the dreaded ending... I just couldn't bare it.
<Nittany_Discord> Scoot-Scootaloo time?
<Chrysalis_> to d-d-d--d- duel
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> ryaxnb: People have been making their own levels. You should check them out.
<ryaxnb> i will
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's time?
<ryaxnb> computers always get da mods
<ryaxnb> that's what made the sims a blast
<CrimsonPhoenix> hold on what's going on
<ryaxnb> i remember sims 1 modded objects were EXTREMELY common
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I wonder how hard Alagon was during the early days of Wrath
<ryaxnb> sims 2 it was more a focus on game mods
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> DAT INTERVIEW
<Meanwhile> Who?
<Dark_Horst> flutter_spin: think i read that one. the one with the drawing pony?
<Gerpie> well that;'s the chat dead ^^
<ryaxnb> than modded objects
<flutter_spin> *cough* http://store.steampowered.com/app/204360/ *cough*
<ryaxnb> both were great games and had some of the best mod communities on the pc
<CrimsonPhoenix> who is this?
<ryaxnb> anyone here a sims fan?
<flutter_spin> Dark_Horst: yeah
<Moopy> wait on the right is that gigabit dude?
<ASoftFluffyThing|Nap> ryaxnb: Me
<ryaxnb> ASoftFluffyThing|Nap, isn't it neat how the PC versions of Sims can be completely different thanks to mods, packs, and DLC?
<ryaxnb> it's just like amazing what modders & EA alike did with the Sims 1 and Sims 2 engines well past their prime
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> is that voice Dex from Sanity not Included? sounds kinda like him
<ryaxnb> modders made an apartment mod for Sims 1
<ASoftFluffyThing|Nap> ryaxnb: I knooooooooooooow. On one of my laptos, I had like over 3000 downloaded items for Sims 3
<ASoftFluffyThing|Nap> No lie
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sketch_Toku_Brony, I thought of that
<ryaxnb> you know Apartment Life?
<ryaxnb> Modders actually had implemented that in Sims 1 with hacked objects
<ryaxnb> it was a neat tech demo
<twilight_sprinkle> whos this guy?
<flutter_spin> Whoa! Wuthering Heights movie is coming out?
<shibaru> tfkhg fkgfkjfkjgfkjgfkjgfhgff hgjhgjhg hgk jhg g f jggf f jhgjh g
<flutter_spin> That's just...freaky
<Nittany_Discord> It's Samrose.
<Moopy> Wait is that lordflamgexfire that used to be on my friends that blocked me?
<Nittany_Discord> Get to hear my horrid voice again.
<ASoftFluffyThing|Nap> I never played the Sims 1. Didn't have a computer at the time and the few Sims 2 games I've played were for PS2

<Dark_Horst> AJIsAwesome|Tired: well, there a few real dieamonds out there. finding them is hard though
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Ok.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> I probably wouldn't cry.
<Dark_Horst> AJIsAwesome|Tired: try FO:E
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> I haven't legitimately cried in years.
<sub06905> dead island theme?
<Dark_Horst> takes husge amounts of time
<Gibson> hes interviewing this guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQCsh_Ryu0c
<Dark_Horst> but it's worth every minute
<Wirisme> it does what it's made to do
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> ^
<Dark_Horst> and i usually stay away from sadfics anyway. nothing really interesting there
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> ^
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> I'm not into sad fics.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> I'm trying to read "Keeping your Hooves on the Ground", but it
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> *it's hard to.
<MadSurge> OH, the MLD movie guy
<Brad[Laptop]> I dont read fanfics, but I like to see more fan content produced. its cool.
<MadSurge> ^
<Brad[Laptop]> I doubt its actually going to happen though
<Brad[Laptop]> a lot of announcements but not much happening...
<Dark_Horst> i just keep recommending FO:E to everyone
<Dark_Horst> it's a fanfic, but quality and story-wise, it's on par with many "real" books out there
<sub06905> FO:E?
<Dark_Horst> fallout: equestria
<sub06905> ah
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark_Horst, I wouldn't mind if I was a fan of Fallout
<CrimsonPhoenix> but sadly I am not
<Dark_Horst> ....that i'm a huge sucker for fallout 3 probably helps, but hey, it's awesoem anyway
<Dark_Horst> CrimsonPhoenix: you dont have to be a fan of fallout
<RaveBrony> Yaaaay. Now I have a Strange Scottish Resistance :3
<Dark_Horst> it works great on its own
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark_Horst, I still don't think it'll catch my interest
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> ^
<Dark_Horst> CrimsonPhoenix: maybe you'd be surprised. give it a shot
<Kurra> eh.
<Dark_Horst> its worth a try
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark_Horst, please don't enforce it
<CrimsonPhoenix> if I'm not interest I am not
<Dark_Horst> just saying

<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Saturn: :D
<DerpyWhooves> Saturn, u srs?
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyWhooves: as serious as i ever am
<Dark_Horst> there was a time when someone would say their age and the whole chat just spill theirs
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> :D
<Dark_Horst> there were so many numbers
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: 25 one day and 12 the next. dammit, i told you not to mess with time machines!
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Dark_Horst: Yesterday? :D
<Derpy_Hooves> sub06905 you really need to quit relying on tabbing
<DerpyWhooves> I'm not here often, so I don't know how serious you are.
<Dark_Horst> AJIsAwesome|Tired: naw, that was a dribböe
<DerpyWhooves> NOOUU LAGGG
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Saturn: Stop messing with the tardis.
<Dark_Horst> *dribble
<sub06905> o.o
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So what determines how much game fps your computer uses? the graphic card?
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyWhooves: how old are you?
<sub06905> didnt even realize :D
<Saturn> 08,01sub06905: everything
<DerpyWhooves> HMM. THAT'S SOME PERSONAL INFORMATION.
<Saturn> 08,01whoops
<Saturn> 08,01i mean SpadeMagnes[R]
<Saturn> 08,01SpadeMagnes[R]: that was the short answer
<Saturn> 08,01SpadeMagnes[R]: would you like the long answer?
<Wirisme> it's not personal when millions of people are also that age :p
<Saturn> 08,01(hint: i'm a computer scientist. you really don't want the long answer.)
<DerpyWhooves> OMG CANZ I DO RDDDDDDDDD
<Derpy_Hooves> MY AGE IS nein nein nein
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well my dad says the ram and cpu dont mean jack shit or the ammount of data it can hold
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And I dont buy that
<DerpyWhooves> I think your Dad is an idiot.
<DerpyWhooves> Sorry.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He uses a Mac to boot
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[R]: your dad is an idiot
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SpadeMagnes[R] cpu and ram are quite important
<DerpyWhooves> Extremely.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I had to argue the hell out of it to make him get me a desktop
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Very important.
<Chrysalis_> Saturn do the long one!
<Chrysalis_> go on
<Chrysalis_> also
*Chrysalis_ hugs Saturn
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Chrysalis_: Oh, mai........;)
<Saturn> 08,01SpadeMagnes[R]: mostly, it's the graphics card, but cpu and ram do also have an effect on framerate
<DerpyWhooves> Well, luckily he did. (Right?)
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yea he told me it doesnt matter how much cpu it has
*Saturn 08,01nuzzles Chrysalis_
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Chrysalis_ long time no see
<Chrysalis_> Saturn depending on the game, the hdd can have a MASSIVE effect
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis_: are you sure? i'm going to start talking about memory latency and associative caches...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I want WoW to be able to run at decent fps
<DerpyWhooves> So basically, this guy is making a movie about My Little Dashie?
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Thought he said Crackle. :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The most i get is 12-17
<Chrysalis> TheGreatAndPowerfulT yeah, been in london for work the last week
<DerpyWhooves> AJIsAwesome, i'm pretty sure he did.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The fps utterly tanks when alot of shit is on screen
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: for badly written games, yes
<Chrysalis> Saturn yup, though examples of where hdd affect the fps are rare, mostly games like minecraft
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> DerpyWhooves: No, he said "crack".
<Chrysalis> which are very heavy IO dependant
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: heh, aye; as i said, badly written games
<Foal_Brovakiin> Goodnight everyone :)
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> He was talking about the crack in her voice.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> NIght, Foal_Brovakiin :)
<thelonepony> night Foal_Brovakiin :)
<sub06905> bai Foal_Brovakiin
<DerpyWhooves> Tru dat.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Also my dad is such a fucking Apple purist
<DerpyWhooves> HOLY
<Chrysalis> Saturn iv yet to get an answer off you as to whether you control the bronyuk twitter
<sub06905> dat yay
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> wow
<DerpyWhooves> How can he do that?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He said the Mac was better than regular computers
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> He just can.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He didnt even give a god damn reason
<DerpyWhooves> Mac's are pretty bad for gaming, from what I've heard.
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[R]: well, that seals the idiot theory
<Chrysalis> SpadeMagnes[R] your dad is not so IT literate
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: the BUCK twitter is BronyUKCon, and yes, i have control over it
<Chrysalis> please dont link to more stores, my bank account is looking rather sad
<DerpyWhooves> I really don't care about what the interview is talking about.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I ask him why does he think macs are so great he says "They just are"
<Dark_Horst> macs are bad at gaming becasue they horribly overprice their hardware
<Dark_Horst> simple as that
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And he says a mac wont break down as fast as other comps
<Chrysalis> i bought the luna off the store you linked the other day within about an hour of you linking it
<Dark_Horst> buy a 2000 dollar desktop, it will laugh at state of the art graphics
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well all he uses it for is web browsing
<Dark_Horst> buy a 2000 dollar desktop, you're lucky if it can run minecraft
<Dark_Horst> *mac
<DerpyWhooves> lulz, dark_horst
<Dark_Horst> DerpyWhooves: dont you dare
<Brad[Laptop]> I bought an 11 inch macbook air for the sole purpose of watching tv shows and movies in bed at night.
<DerpyWhooves> "Don't you dare" what?
<DerpyWhooves> dark_whorst?
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[R]: and that is why he doesnt know jack about what he'S talking
<Freefall29> sup everypony
<DerpyWhooves> Hay
<sub06905> ello Freefall29
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Hi, Freefall29
<thelonepony> hi Freefall29 :)
<Freefall29> what are we watching
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Interview.
<Saturn> 08,01i've just put together a really sweet gaming machine for someone for about £900
<Freefall29> what interview is this for
<DerpyWhooves> I just love how little the interviewer cares about this.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yea... so all the arguments he said werent reasonable or facts were true...
<DerpyWhooves> He's just like, "IDGAF"
<Brad[Laptop]> Saturn nice
<thelonepony> wow Saturn :O
<Freefall29> what movie are they talking about
<Chrysalis> Saturn thats about what i just paid updating mine
<Dark_Horst> DerpyWhooves: jumping a typing error to put falsified arguments in this debate. i know youn wanted to. i can smell you grinning fro here
<DerpyWhooves> Needs some music, it's so... boring.
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: what spec?
<Brad[Laptop]> I built a gaming pc a year ago with an i7-2600k, 2x crossfired radeon 5850s, 120gb ssd for <$900
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Welp! Back to reading Dark Id lp's from the Archive!
<DerpyWhooves> Wha...?
<Chrysalis> quad 4.2GHZ, 250GB SSD 6870
*DerpyWhooves is confused.
<Dark_Horst> that'S also why you dont go for mac if you want actual performance. buy the parts seperatly, you cans ave huge amounts of money
<Chrysalis> bout 4TB in HDDs
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: also, got the details for that combination?
<DerpyWhooves> LOL!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What pisses me off is he planned on getting me a Mac book air WITH OUT TELLING ME FIRST
<Brad[Laptop]> When I move im probably going to build a new pc with 2x of the 7000 series cards
<Freefall29> can someone fill me in on what movie they're interviewing about
<Brad[Laptop]> SpadeMagnes[R] take it if its free :P
<Saturn> 08,01i7 3820, 16gb low latency ddr3 RAM, x79 motherboard, Radeon 7870, 1TB hdd, el-cheapo case, 800W power supply
<Chrysalis> mmm do want a new GPU
<Brad[Laptop]> I find myself spending a lot of money on power supplies because i dont want cheapo crap ones.
<DerpyWhooves> FlutterWonder rabiesbun edition.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> 16 Ram is overdoing it right now
<Dark_Horst> not bad. not bad at all
<Chrysalis> plan for next paycheck is to put maybe £300 into one
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> 8 will do just fine
<Brad[Laptop]> 16gb of ram is dirt cheap you cant afford not to get it
<Wrek> 05TheGreatAndPowerfulT i disagree
<Chrysalis> TheGreatAndPowerfulT not really, i run 8 and have issues where i run out
<Brad[Laptop]> I think I paid $50 for my 16gb kit
<Dark_Horst> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: depends. 3dartists will need it
<CK|Ded> Saturn: Pretty solid. I think it's a bit better than my rig. *jelly*
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but he want's it for gaming not 3d art
<DerpyWhooves> OMG GAIZ, IS DA GREAT AND POWERFUL T!
<Chrysalis> but then, part of that was buying a new win7 license
<gunter_the_penguin> :)
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Um.......okay?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well my WoW takes up like 20Gb or so
<Dark_Horst> if you just need your pc for gaming, 8 should do. even with newest titles
<Brad[Laptop]> I havent bought a copy of win7 ever
<DerpyWhooves> I wish I had windows 7.
<Brad[Laptop]> I figure i have laptops that I have junked that came with win7 so imma just use my "license" on another pc.
<DerpyWhooves> I hear so many good things about it.
<Dark_Horst> but multitasking could require more
<Dark_Horst> see streamers
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I have Vista...
<DerpyWhooves> Same here.
<Brad[Laptop]> vista after the service packs isn't that bad.
<DerpyWhooves> Well, right now I'm using a crappy XP.
<Dark_Horst> DerpyWhooves: just pirate it. easy
<Brad[Laptop]> but I do like 7.
<Saturn> 08,01CK|Ded: the CPU is a really good one for gaming; it's the cheapest Sandy Bridge E processor, and there are some cornerss cut, but none of them really affect gaming
<Saturn> 08,01and i found it in a bundle deal
<DerpyWhooves> I probably will, but I'm gonna get help from moi fatherr
<Freefall29> Derpy_Hooves: better upgrade soon, support for xp aint gonna last long
<Saturn> 08,01which meant i could up the graphics card to something nicer than originally planned
<Saturn> 08,01
<Brad[Laptop]> Ill probably go with one of the 6 core i7s on my next build.
<AJIsAwesome|Tired>
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Hm?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well unfortunately I'll have to hope my dad buys me a GOOD Desktop because apperently I don't get a say in what I exactly want
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Children of Faust / DJ octavia 03 / I Need This
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> What was that?
<Brad[Laptop]> SpadeMagnes[R] ever consider building one?
<Derpy_Hooves> Freefall29 stop ponging the wrong derpy
<DerpyWhooves> Freefall, this isn't my main computer, my main one has Vista.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'm 16 and lack a job. how would I even do that
<Derpy_Hooves> pinging
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: though, what does low latency on the ram tell us?
<doctor_whooves127> i tend to prefure dubs
<Brad[Laptop]> SpadeMagnes[R] well if hes buying you stuff ask him for money instead so you can choose your own...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek but you use art programms and 3d modeling programs those are heavy dependant of the Ram a gaming computer can do just fine with 8 Ram right now
<SpadeMagnes[R]> No...he just keeps saying its his money so he gets to decide <.< sigh...
<DerpyWhooves> Hey, do you guys know any good fanfictions?
<Brad[Laptop]> Take what you can get then and dont complain.
<twilight_sprinkle> i have to agree with Brad[Laptop]
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont even ask for a desktop
<Brad[Laptop]> ;)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis haven't try win 8 so i don't have a say in that
<Dark_Horst> SpadeMagnes[R]: well, thats a huge load of bullshit
<Saturn> 08,01Brad[Laptop]: the 3820 is a fantastic little chip. it has 10MB of 20-way L3 cache, which is great for gaming performance, and makes memory latency a non-issue
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I know, but its going to be the computer I'm going to be stuck with I should be allowed to have a say in for what I want
<DerpyWhooves> Who here likes Inception?
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: you are aware that we dont actually know what that means?
<Saturn> 08,01DerpyWhooves: i do!
<Brad[Laptop]> Saturn im not famailar with all the different models of chips intel has in the i7 family
<DerpyWhooves> :D
<DerpyWhooves> >:l
<DerpyWhooves> =D
<twilight_sprinkle> Derpy_Hooves: i do
<Saturn> 08,01Dark_Horst: i just explained what it means
<DerpyWhooves> *DerpyWhooves
<Brad[Laptop]> I just chose the 2600k because it was unlocked and a good price at about $300 when i bought it
<Derpy_Hooves> ...
<Saturn> 08,01it increases performence
<Brad[Laptop]> SpadeMagnes[R] beggars can't be choosers.
<Dark_Horst> i got that much
<Saturn> 08,01Brad[Laptop]: the 3820 is about £80 more, but is a *lot* better
<Dark_Horst> i still dont know what you just talked about^^
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I fail to see how thats relavent Brad
<Brad[Laptop]> Saturn unlocked chip?
<Dark_Horst> but i guess i had to study computer science for that
<Saturn> 08,01Brad[Laptop]: yup
<Saturn> 08,01can be OC'd to > 4GHz
<Brad[Laptop]> SpadeMagnes[R] you say you want something but don't have any money for it and your mad if your dad chooses it for you.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> If its going to be my personal computer for a while I should be allowed to pick one
<Chrysalis> Saturn my chip is 4.2ghz stock
<Brad[Laptop]> I run my 2600k at 3.8ghz
<Saturn> 08,01Brad[Laptop]: though, unlocking is a *really* bad idea on some of these chips
<Saturn> 08,01the reason they're locked in the first place is because the locked cores are ones that have failed testing
<Brad[Laptop]> I had it up at 4.3ghz
<Brad[Laptop]> but it wasn't good i didnt get one of the good 2600ks that can go to like 5ghz
<Brad[Laptop]> I meant unlocked multiplier and voltage controls.
<Brad[Laptop]> Not locked cores.
<Saturn> 08,01they get, say, a 4-core chip, and if 2 cores fail testing, they lock those 2 cores out and sell it as a 2-core chip
<DerpyWhooves> Wait, is there a sequel to My Little Dashie?
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> I guess so.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I have no idea what is going on
<Freefall29> DerpyWhooves: yeah. unoffical but approved by the author
<Brad[Laptop]> SpadeMagnes[R] discussing multiple things.
<Saturn> 08,01Brad[Laptop]: ah, right; yeah, the 3280 has unlocked mults and volts
<strawberrie_smuckerz> what's my lil dashie?
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Fnfic
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> *Fanfic
<Freefall29> SpadeMagnes[R]: we watching an interview for my little dashie: the movie, and in comments we talking about computers
<strawberrie_smuckerz> AJIsAwesome|Tired, one of those sexual ones?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I know alot on how to opperate a computer but I know jack shit about the components
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> No. :S
<Dark_Horst> strawberrie_smuckerz: fanfic. some mopy guy finds a rainbow dash. dont know more than that. there are people who love it and people who say it'S horribly overated. the usual
<Wirisme> lol
<Brad[Laptop]> SpadeMagnes[R] i used to be the same way, a programmer who didn't know anything about the inside of a computer lol.
<Freefall29> strawberrie_smuckerz: in a nut shell... mld is where filly rainbow dash comes to our world and a lonely brony who has nothing left raises her for 15 years....
<DerpyWhooves> I think we need a Pinkamena icon, for a sad face.
<twilight_sprinkle> dat music
<Dark_Horst> Freefall29 sems to sum it up well

<Ponies47> Ohai scout19_tf2
<CrimsonPhoenix> AdamTheDuck, real genuine sincere hugs make people feel better
<CrimsonPhoenix> not E-hugs
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> twilight_sprinkle: Actually, that doesn't sound like a bad idea.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gagh
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn streams classical music! Damnit I need to see Saturn streams for often. :|
*Ponies47 Ruffles Saturn 's mane
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: yeah, i missed the time he did too :\
<thelonepony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlbDPrSjNB0&list=UUJEEBGR1_4tM3uDaXQ-Aqjw&index=22&feature=plcp
<sub06905> or watch Saturn play his Cello :3
<Wirisme> Classical music you say? what kind?
<Saturn> 08,01Wirisme: lots of kinds
<Wirisme> :)
<DerpyWhooves> what just happened
<Saturn> 08,01i have a lot of late romantic and early 20thC music
<Wirisme> Excellent :)
<Saturn> 08,01quite a few of the nationalist composers
<Saturn> 08,01impressionists, expressionists, even some wierd stuff like Hindemith
<Wirisme> Don't know many of those. That'd be like Mussorgsky right?
<Wirisme> Nationalist that is
<Saturn> 08,01Nationalist woudl be like Stravinksy and Shostakovich
<Saturn> 08,01*Stravinsky
<Wirisme> What's your opinion on Messiaen?
<scout19_tf2> u got russian
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so catchy and full of 80's goodness :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEANHnqiyrU
*Ponies47 Goes back to working on Art
*Wirisme is Messiaen fan
<Princess_Cadence> <--is watchin back to the future par 3
<Saturn> 08,01i do quite like Messieaen
<Ponies47> Hmmm I need to restart my computer. BRB
<Freefall29> I'm gonna boot me up some worldcraft 3.3
<Wirisme> Good choice Princess_Cadence :)
<StinkomanFan> Nationalist is Sandvich?
<twilight_sprinkle> le sigh. i remember all those names but nothing more. 5 years of music school wasted, even though i knew the stuff at the time :\
<Princess_Cadence> ive seen 1 and 2 alreddy :P
<Wirisme> I need to listen to some Shostakovich, haven't heard much of his stuff at all
<Saturn> 08,01but i prefer Hindemith and Penderecki
<Wirisme> Prokofiev on the other hand :D
<Saturn> 08,01Prokofiev and Stravinsky are two of my all-time favourites
<Saturn> 08,01but
<scout19_tf2> man i just read this kick ass shiping story on EQD
<Wirisme> You mean early Penderecki or the neo-romantic stuff?
<Saturn> 08,01though i harp on about that time period a lot, i have a deep, deep love of baroque and renaissance music
<Wirisme> I quite like both
<Freefall29> scout19_tf2: what story was it
<Saturn> 08,01Wirisme: i prefer his neo-romantic phase, but i do quite like some of his earlier stuff
<Wirisme> I used to have most of his symphonies, was good stuff
<Saturn> 08,01my cello teacher when i was at school was a baroque specialist, and she imbued a love of that music in me
<scout19_tf2> it was really old though/soaring hearts
<Wirisme> I should listen to more baroque really, Bach is pretty much the only one I really love.
<Nife> I'm a filly and what is this.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Oh dear god that's a wonderful crossover
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> DAT Nife :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/ZGgf5.jpg

<BarbetosSMASH> CrimsonPhoenixwell she looks like a ghost in the Fall out equestria universe.
<CrimsonPhoenix> BarbetosSMASH, and nope it's not that
<alexxm> bye GilDash

<scout19_tf2> :'(
<BarbetosSMASH> CrimsonPhoenix what is relavent then?
<Ponies47> Night GilDash :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> any other guesses?
<BarbetosSMASH> No.
<AdamTheDuck> CrimsonPhoenix, Old World Blues in Fallout Equestria? ponyshrug.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> AdamTheDuck, nope
<BarbetosSMASH> That is what I said
<AdamTheDuck> Oh snap, there's a Phase5, shit just got real
<Ryunosuke> reminds me more of Shadowrun than Fallout
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it's not Shadowrun
<Ryunosuke> i am just saying, it seems a bit... hi-tech for fallout
<CrimsonPhoenix> Notice the character in focus, who is she? How is she right now?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Look at her surronding, those creatures, what are they, what can they do?
<AdamTheDuck> Well Ghost from Starcraft has similar armour and hairstyle... But I think she's blonde in Starcraft...
<CrimsonPhoenix> AdamTheDuck, Kerrigan
<AdamTheDuck> Right
<CrimsonPhoenix> and yeah it's from starcraft
<alexxm> night guys
<CrimsonPhoenix> Chrysalis being a pony in this picture
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight alexxm
<thelonepony> Night alexxm
<CrimsonPhoenix> get's ambush and captured by changelings, playing the zerg
<AdamTheDuck> Suddenly stream :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> and then that chrysalis becomes the queen
<CrimsonPhoenix> just like Kerrigan
<AdamTheDuck> Ahhhh, I get it now CrimsonPhoenix
<CrimsonPhoenix> gotta know the starcraft lore for this guess

<AJIsAwesome|Tired> ohai Shizu
<Moopy> Hello Shizuka
<Freefall29> what kind of game is this
<Ryunosuke> hey Shizuka
<thelonepony> Hi Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13this is one of two technically new things i have to stream
<Dovah> not sure if want..
<Cypresswolf> Doesn't want to watch because I havent made it that far in 4....
<Reactor> Hi, Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13but this first
*Shammy kicks Meanwhile "i said stoooops!"
<Shizuka> 13because revelation is stupidly hard
*Meanwhile clonks Shammy in the head with a cinderblock.
<Shammy> owwwww
<Ryunosuke> Freefall29, Myst is one of the original ... puzzle rpgs
<Shammy> i didnt even kick you thar hard Meanwhile!
<Freefall29> Ryunosuke: cool.
<Meanwhile> Yeah but yer a slag.
<Shizuka> 13the other thing i have to stream is an old classic, but requires booting a VM and wiring winamp up and bleh, too much to do
<Freefall29> this 90's or a 2000's title
<Dovah> Music is so beautiful! <3
<Derpy_Hooves> Shizuka: im digging this soundtrack
*Shammy glares at Meanwhile "meanie head"
<Shizuka> 13prepare yourselves for cheese-sha... i mean yeesha
<Ryunosuke> myst series isnt a bad series per se, I just dont prefer it myself
<Moopy> Hey everypony what does the scouter say about his power level?
<Meanwhile> Cheese? I hate cheese.
<Shizuka> 13myst is partially based on cheese
<AdamTheDuck> Hail Cheese-kun, the true ruler of Britiania!~
<doctor_whooves127> wht is this?
<scout19_tf2> cheeze6_9
<Cheese> Meanwhile: I like chocolate milk.
<thelonepony> so Mist IV is a steam punk game?
<Princess_Cadence> what movie is this?
<AdamTheDuck> Princess_Cadence, game, and It's Myst IV
<Meanwhile> Cheese: I hate you.
*Shammy facehoofs
<Princess_Cadence> o.o
<BarbetosSMASH> That patented Shizuka nod
<Shammy> owww i hurt my forehead
<Cheese> Meanwhile: I love you too.
<Princess_Cadence> it looks like a movie
<BarbetosSMASH> It makes me giggle Shizuka XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d5c7yvc
<Meanwhile> I think you should be quiet little girl.
<VenHur> Whoa, what game is this?
<BarbetosSMASH> Oh CrimsonPhoenix what was that pic referencing?
<Dark_Horst> interesting graphicdesign
<Shizuka> 13sure it's prerendered, but this sequence puts most in-game cutscenes to shame
<CrimsonPhoenix> BarbetosSMASH, you mean with chrysalis?
<AdamTheDuck> VenHur, Myst IV
<CrimsonPhoenix> or the one just now?
<Spitfire> BarbetosSMASH: shadow of the collosus
<CrimsonPhoenix> heeh you can see the one just now from the description...
<BarbetosSMASH> CrimsonPhoenix Oh I think I get it now
<BarbetosSMASH> Its a SC2 reference isn't it?
<CrimsonPhoenix> More like Starcraft but yes
<scout19_tf2> this is like a game/movie
<BarbetosSMASH> Well yeah.
<CrimsonPhoenix> since the story of Kerrigan's corruption was in the first one
<Shizuka> 13bzzt
<BarbetosSMASH> Oooooh ow... ooooh ow.... oooohh ow.
<Shammy> Shizuka! no premature deaths! we wanna see gameplay!
<BarbetosSMASH> Never learns
<CrimsonPhoenix> can you even die in myst?
<Shizuka> 13atrus and me go way back
<Shizuka> 13i'm sure he won't mind if i dig through all his stuff before saying hi
<Shammy> hehe
<Meanwhile> What's a little privacy invasion between friends.
<scout19_tf2> sneeky sneeky
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause I thought it was just an exploration game where you have to click the correct stuff in the correct order to progress
<Shizuka> 13i've only saved his gravelly butt three times now
<Meanwhile> Sneaky.
<Shizuka> 13i do love rand miller's voice though
<scout19_tf2> wut system is this for
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> PC
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> I think.
<Shizuka> 13moment...
<Dark_Horst> seeing how it's a point and click adventure, i'd say pc
*Meanwhile , moments later...
<Shizuka> 13four year old sister getting into things she isn't supposed to....
<RaveBrony> |:
<RaveBrony> Well thats not good
<Dark_Horst> ooooh... THAT old puzzle
<twilight_sprinkle> needs to be opposite phase at each point
<Dark_Horst> star trek elite force did tha too
<Shizuka> 13gtfo google
<Dark_Horst> not as complex though
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl
<Wirisme> dat crash
<Dark_Horst> ...i think
<Meanwhile> Google wants to see.
<VenHur> Okay, I looked up the Myst series over at Wikipedia...say to see that there were five games.
<VenHur> *sad
<Freefall29> speaking of puzzle games... you guys heard of a puzzle flash series called submachine?
<VenHur> Also, I have to say, live action-ish character models in a computer generated world is stunning for it's time.
<Shizuka> 13atrus you suck at this
<Mozdoc> You know if he built this damn thing, and he's the expert on this, why doesn't HE get on the controls?
<Shizuka> 13this went faster when i tested earlier >>
<Freefall29> brb guys. dinner
<AJIsAwesome|Tired> Need food. Brb.
<Princess_Cadence> im eating dinner now\
<Princess_Cadence> pizza :)

<Shizuka> 13ONE JOB ATRUS, DON'T BLOW UP THE THING
<Shizuka> 13BUT NOOOOOOO
<Shammy> had to go and fuck it all up atrus
<BarbetosSMASH> Well better not stop now. Blow up all the things
<VenHur> So, what's the Myst series all about in a nutshell?
<Shizuka> 13i have to do everything for this man...
<Shizuka> 13let me out of d'ni shizu
<Mozdoc> This sounds overly complicated.
<Shammy> VenHur! teleporating books and madman!
<Shizuka> 13safe my wife and kill my father for me shizu
<Shizuka> 13save the world an entire civ will be relocating to shizu
<twilight_sprinkle> hm, this game looks like fun, maybe i should get it

<Shammy> Shizuka: i take offense to the ADHD thing...
<scout19_tf2> and he didt do it
<LadyCanary> XD
<scout19_tf2> :D
<Dark_Horst> kid, it'S a gecko
<Meanwhile> Probably should have given him an easier job.
<Dark_Horst> what the hell is so fucking fascinating about a gecko in the desertß
<Meanwhile> So the necklace is weed.
<scout19_tf2> nods:D
<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, seems legit
<Obsidian> So this is live action mixed with CGI interesting
<Meanwhile> Necklace of +10 Altitude.
<VenHur> So I looked at Wikipedia, they said a movie based on the secound novel is at work.
<Tiberium126> What game is this?
<VenHur> Myst IV.
<Dark_Horst> myst 4
<Tiberium126> Looks nice
<p4ngya> pet the birdie :3
<VenHur> God, the enviorment of the game is so AWESOME!
<VenHur> I'm sorry, I can't be quiet over this, this game is SO high quality back in 2004!
<Dark_Horst> big hydroelectrical power plant? PRESS BUTTONS!
<superretroworld> whats this game about, science?
<Dark_Horst> what could go wrong, right?
<VenHur> No, it's a point-and-click game with challenging puzzles and whatsnot.
<Bronysith> my god, that bison burger was awesome
<Ponies47> Sorry I keep having to do stuff on my computer adjusting settings and such
<VenHur> "The ending has not been written"...Hrmm...
<superretroworld> oh cool, love puzzles, especially portal
<Ponies47> I also switched to Google Chrome like just now so I'm testing that out right now
<VenHur> I also starting to LOVE the soundtrack of this game.
<Shizuka> 13sorry about it occasionally spazzing the mouse
<VenHur> It gives that "mysterious world" vibe and actually kind of sounds sad...
<Reactor> Suddenly, I'm in the middle of a thunderstorm.
<Shizuka> 13oh btw this is 1800s earth
<Meanwhile> I question the historical accuracy.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Uh-oh.....
<Dark_Horst> ^^
<VenHur> 1800's Earth?
<Shizuka> 13they basically live in the middle of the new mexico desert
<Shizuka> 13so no one will find them anytime soon
<scout19_tf2> wut year
<Reactor> Didn't you guys recognise it?
<FlutterMEDIC> btw, i've been here for a while XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Guys...I think I'm about to go full 4chan now....
<Ryunosuke> think... wild wild west :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Check out
<CrimsonPhoenix> these
<CrimsonPhoenix> DUBS http://i.imgur.com/bV3BV.png
<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix, lol
<VenHur> I don't know, it's looked like more of an futuristic-like setting than an 1800s setting.
<scout19_tf2> ohey FlutterMEDIC
<VenHur> In my honest opinions anyways.
<thelonepony> hi FlutterMEDIC
<Phase4> wudis?
<Obsidian> I wonder why
<VenHur> Hello FlutterMEDIC.
<Shizuka> 13and there she goes....
<Phase4> Shizuka, this myst?
<Shizuka> 13keep an eye on yeesha...riiiiiiiiight
<thelonepony> Phase4 Myst IV
<VenHur> For a girl her age...she's kind of intelligent.
<Dark_Horst> clearly victorian
<Meanwhile> That's because she lives in the Desert.
<Meanwhile> Without any peers.
<Phase4> myst 3 and 4 seem imposible to buy
<Dark_Horst> i would even go as far as calling it steampunk
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<Shizuka> 13as much as i love revelation
<Shizuka> 13i hate hate hate the puzzles
<Phase4> also i have to stop watching lest it get spoiled :(
<Obsidian> Hello Bronysith
<CrimsonPhoenix> Holy cockatrice that's the most cutest thing I've seen http://fav.me/d57nytj
<Dark_Horst> thouhg, not sure on the punk part. doesnt seem very ounky
<scout19_tf2> olo Bronysmith
<Dark_Horst> *punky
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Bronysith :)
<thelonepony> hi Bronysith
<BarbetosSMASH> puzzles the puzzler
<scout19_tf2> Bronysith
<VenHur> Shizuka: A game has its flaws sometimes. But at least the setting and music of the game are beyond words.
<twilight_sprinkle> i thought the point of the game was puzzles
<Ponies47> I was not amused by Google Chrome's ways on this website. FireFox seems pretty good right now
<Meanwhile> The point of this game is getting that little girl away from her hallucinogenic necklace.
<Dark_Horst> ....i have no idea what shizu is doing there
<VenHur> I'm using Chrome and it's alright for me so far...
<VenHur> Sure, it freezes sometimes, but just barely.
<twilight_sprinkle> chrome is fine with this website for me too. although after the latest updates chrome seems to be memory leaking
<Shizuka> 13suddenly ocarina of time
<Dark_Horst> kid, you sound HIDEOUS
<Bronysith> good game
<VenHur> ....My ears...
<VenHur> My poor ears....
<Dark_Horst> Shizuka, make it stop!
<scout19_tf2> mu ears bleed
<Obsidian> I feel sorry for her brother
<scout19_tf2> my
<Reactor> "I've got to get it perfect so it takes me back in time"
<VenHur> Thanks Celestia!
<VenHur> Jeesh, now I need new eardrums...

<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome|Working, also http://fav.me/d57nytj
<Mozdoc> There's something still hauntily beautiful about the Myst worlds even when they're destroyed.
<VenHur> God, the enviorment looked more beautiful in nighttime...
<FlutterMEDIC> Dark_Horst: speaking of resonance cascade, i just finished Black Mesa
<Shizuka> 13Dark_Horst: DAMMIT ATRUS YOU HAD ONE JOB
<Meanwhile> What WAS Atrus's job?
<AJIsAwesome|Working> CrimsonPhoenix: Got any more? I love these.

<Shizuka> 13yeah
<Meanwhile> So he's an age writer.
<VenHur> Okay...this music is midly disturbing...
<Meanwhile> But he fails.
<AJIsAwesome|Working> VenHur: Adds to the atmosphere.
<Midnight_Stormwing> <_< >_>
<Midnight_Stormwing> its been ages since i talked in here...
<Freefall29> hello Midnight_Stormwing
<Midnight_Stormwing> so many... unknown people...
<Obsidian> Hello Midnight_Stormwing

<Bronysith> Midnight_Stormwing: oh hey man, we need to play dead island again or something
<Midnight_Stormwing> its probably been a couple months since i actually talked in here...
<VenHur> A couple of months?
<Midnight_Stormwing> someday Bronysith, but not anytime soon... college is very busy
<Bronysith> Midnight_Stormwing: jes, jes it is
<Midnight_Stormwing> yeah... couple months, i lurked alot though... just never said anything
<Mozdoc> Everything in Myst needs a lever.

<Midnight_Stormwing> using allons-y as a greeting... kinda ironic when its french for 'lets go'
<CrimsonPhoenix> not allos
<Freefall29> luna waved at me.
<CrimsonPhoenix> please don't do that mistake again
<CrimsonPhoenix> and yes what Midnight_Stormwing said

<cachi01|phone> now to wait another 7 months for 5 season 2 episodes :/
<Fluttercry> 05,15I see a point and click adventure of some kind...
<SpeedyBolt> i see a bit of puzzle there too.
<Reactor> You see Myst IV
<cachi01|phone> SpeedyBolt, i blame discovery kids
<Shizuka> 13on thing to remember
<SpeedyBolt> Same.
<Shizuka> 13there are no 3d models in this game
<Fluttercry> 05,15wait wut....
<Shizuka> 13everything is either a video file or static background
<SpeedyBolt> wat
<QuinnThePegaSistta> is it going to be scary??
<Shizuka> 13so that elevator with two windows
<Shizuka> 13that's two separate videos
<SpeedyBolt> That's pretty impressive, actually
<Obsidian> Interesting
<Mozdoc> Myst is quite spectacular in how it looks, yes.
<Fluttercry> 05,15I just feel alone whenever I try to play Myst
<cachi01|phone> speaking of static i just watched marble hornets 1 - 46
<Fluttercry> 05,15So alone
<otakon> Fluttercry: that's the point
<SpeedyBolt> D'awww
<Reactor> cachi01|phone: Why would you do that to yourself
<SpeedyBolt> I'm immune to being along, i already am
<Shizuka> 13AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION

<Fluttercry> 05,15Blue!
<FlutterMEDIC> BLUE
<SpeedyBolt> Blue
<Obsidian> Red!
<Reactor> purple
<Fluttercry> 05,15No wait. Take the red one. Travel down the rabit hole
<Tiberium126> Blue
<Obsidian> Too late
<otakon> lol
<SpeedyBolt> Dad wants me, brb
<cachi01|phone> Reactor, the series is awesome
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> BLue
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> WHoops.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Nvm.
<cachi01|phone> banana
<Reactor> cachi01|phone: I watched the first 4 or 5 episodes and couldn't continue.
<RaveBrony> :o
<Fluttercry> 05,15Am I the only one that's not terrified of Slender Man? Everyone's always like "AAAWWW BRO THIS S*** IS SO SCARY" but I don't see it.
<Reactor> I'm a baby
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^^
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Never saw Slenderman scary to begin with.
<Fluttercry> 05,15Even Marble Hornets is just "Well, that's awesome. Not scared though"
<scout19_tf2> still reading books shizuka?
<cachi01|phone> Reactor, really? this was my first time watching marble hornets lol
<cachi01|phone> i still have 20 episodes to watch
<otakon> buffer
<otakon> DAMN YOU BUFFER!
<Kandarihu> Fluttercry, I'm sure there are other people who don't fear the Slenderman
<cachi01|phone> 20 entries*
<SpeedyBolt> I dont fear Slenderman.
<Tiberium126> Crystals
<SpeedyBolt> ...Not in games, anyways
<Obsidian> Snapshot
<FlutterMEDIC> But do you fear SCP-137?
<Fluttercry> 05,15For example, one of my friends played Slender and was screaming and freaking out every five seconds. So then I played it and was bored to death.
<SpeedyBolt> If I saw some abnormally tall guy follow me in real life, I would be scared.
<Reactor> On Monday I was walking to the bus and saw a bunch of slenderman notes taped to trees. I walked faster.
<otakon> Reactor: good idea
<cachi01|phone> Fluttercry, same here
<SpeedyBolt> Slenderman isnt scary because its SO predictable.
<Shizuka> 13let's see where we'll be going~
<Fluttercry> 05,15Now saying that, The Weeping Angels and Amnesia scare the hell out of me
<Garettbrony> cool
<Garettbrony> who is playing
<SpeedyBolt> JUSTINE
<cachi01|phone> its boring before the 5 notes
<SpeedyBolt> LET ME TASTE YOU~
<FlutterMEDIC> But is anyone scared of SCP-137?
<Tiberium126> SpeedyBolt, I'm abnormatlly tall so im going to follow you
<SpeedyBolt> Crap
<Obsidian> Garettbrony: Shizu
<Garettbrony> oh
<Tiberium126> SpeedyBolt, joing im 6,3
<Garettbrony> is this myst 2
<Tiberium126> Joking*

<Garettbrony> oh

*Bronysith slaps Scoot-Scootaloo
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Scoot-Scootaloo: :I
<Fluttercry> 05,15Now, the BEN creepypasta and Mr. Widemouth...those are scary
<LadyCanary> Scoots!
<LadyCanary> ^_^
<Spectrum_Rush> oh plese not ben
<SpeedyBolt> I disagree on the BEN creepypasta
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Never heard of Mr. WIdemouth.
<Reactor> Never heard of them, don't want to know.
<cachi01|phone> BEN really scared the shit put of me
<FlutterMEDIC> again, SCP-137...thoughts?
<Garettbrony> Luna in the sky with diamonds
<SpeedyBolt> It doesnt scare me, really.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I don't find BEN scary at all.
<cachi01|phone> i do..
<Reactor> Fluttercry: Which one is that?
<SpeedyBolt> Now Majora's Mask as a game is scary, but...
<cachi01|phone> i dont even want to play MM again lol
<Bronysith> Fluttercry: im not scared of slenderman either, but one time in a dream he was there, so out of place, just appeared behind me out of nowhere, and i woke up screaming
<SpeedyBolt> Plz
<otakon> brb guys
<Fluttercry> 05,15Reactor the one with the posessed Majora's Mask game
<Shizuka> 13behold, haven~
<SpeedyBolt> I beat MM 3 times, after reading BEN.
<Shizuka> 13let's go!
<SpeedyBolt> HAVEN
<FlutterMEDIC> again, thoughts on SCP-137
<Bronysith> Majoras Mask is my fav zelda game, so awesome
<Garettbrony> I dont care for 12
<Spectrum_Rush> Bronysith: /)
<Fluttercry> 05,15HUZZAH!....what's Haven?
<SpeedyBolt> To the Scootamobile!
<ASoftFluffyThing> FlutterMEDIC: Don't you mean SCP-173?
<Bronysith> Spectrum_Rush: (\
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> What's SCP-137?
<FlutterMEDIC> ASoftFluffyThing: there it is
<Reactor> Yeah, don't want to know
<Fluttercry> 05,15If that's the one with the statue...Dr. Who did it first
<FlutterMEDIC> thats the Statue
<SpeedyBolt> This is like a rollercoaster
<Fluttercry> 05,15My favorite SCP is the colony of sentient Marxist Spiders
<FlutterMEDIC> that one was awesome
<SpeedyBolt> A very odd rollercoaster
<FlutterMEDIC> i think my favorite were the tomatoes XD
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> SCP-173? What are SCP's
<ASoftFluffyThing> I do admit that 173 is creepy-looking but if it weren't a Euclid and a Safe instead, I'd have it as a friend. Unfortunately, concrete doesn't make for good pillows
<cachi01|phone> SpeedyBolt, OH YEAH? well i.....i.....visited they disney website without my parents permissipn!
<Nittany_Discord> Anyone else that has tried to connect to a MLP heroes server having trouble getting on those servers?

<CrimsonPhoenix> http://derpy.me/RA-4p
<Shizuka> 13the crazy one :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> SIGN THIS
<CrimsonPhoenix> PLEASE

<Obsidian> Crystaline_Shard: Myst 4
<Crystaline_Shard> ah ok thanks.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tiberium126, what
<Kandarihu> I'm not signing that petition. It's not that I'm against what it's for. It's that you shouldn't be using the federal government as your golden hammer.
<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix, Signed it just for ya
<CrimsonPhoenix> Thank you
<RaveBrony> Tie to go exercise and shiz....Ill be back a bit later :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> YAC is an awful person and he shouldn't perform in any convention
<RaveBrony> *Time
<DashWithRainbows> Nittany_Discord They're not showing up for me either. I wish they would've posted a small notice as to why they are down.
<Reactor> Well, I'm going to bed. Thanks for reminding me of scary things, everyone.
<SpeedyBolt> I just read that thing...
<DoctorWhoovesV10> im back everypony
<SpeedyBolt> Normally, I would have any-
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Sleep well, Reactor :)
<SpeedyBolt> APPLES
<thelonepony> night Reactor
<Garettbrony> apples?
<Fluttercry> 05,15Honestly, I don't think people should petition to not have him perform.
<Tiberium126> Reactor, have good dreams. muhahahah
<Tiberium126> get that crab
<Nittany_Discord> Hope so DashWithRainbows.
<DashWithRainbows> Hopefully they will be back up shortly. PF2 heroes is my most played server and I don't feel like playing TF2 without being on it.
<Crystaline_Shard> CrimsonPhoenix: it's their fault for letting him appear in the first place. you host a convention it's your own problem you want a sexist to rap at your connvention you deal with it maybe listen to some of his songs before allowing him to perform.
<Kimori_Cookies> whys that?
<Crystaline_Shard> :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> Crystaline_Shard, well I guess your right...

<Crystaline_Shard> Darn. haha it's horrible and we need more suffering.
<Shizuka> 13feeling like nopony is watching anymore..
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome|Busy: What did they do?
<QuinnThePegaSistta> im watching
<Obsidian> Shizuka: I watchin..
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ASoftFluffyThing: They were originally fruit shapes and now they're ball shaped with swirls.
<Crystaline_Shard> I am I'm a Fan of Myst.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'm watching, Shizuka
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Me too.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Just working on other things as well. :D
<Crystaline_Shard> We just have no clue what's going on so can't talk about it.
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome|Busy: they....swirly balls....BLAAAAAAASHPHEMEEEEEEEEH
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Yep.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It killed Trix for me.
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: I'm watching - been sometime since I caught one of your Myst series playthroughs
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I also loved Tony's Cinnamon Crunchers.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I hope they still have the original in the stores. I haven't had Trix since I was a kid.
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/QRfDk.jpg
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome|Busy: They were balls to begin with, then they became the fruit shapes, then they went back to balls...though I kind of liked the fruit shapes better when they switched to them
<RAWRity> so you guys, you better hope I win B movie this week, because next week I have a new B Movie and it's much, much worse.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: i told you to delete that picture of me =_=
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> J_E_Smith71: I know. It's just that I prefer the fruit shapes/
<sub06905> Meanwhile: O.O
<Obsidian> Meanwhile: Dat Uncanny Valley

<Fluttercry> 05,15RAWRity oh god...what is it
<Cypresswolf> That feel of finding incredible treasure but nowhere to spend it
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dammit Meanwhile, put that away. We're talking about cereal
<RAWRity> Fluttercry: The Love Guru
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> I should suggest Borat one day but....nah, not gonna do that.
<superretroworld> RAWRity: is the point of b movies to pick a movie so bad it cant even be watched
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ASoftFluffyThing: NO. :D
<RAWRity> superretroworld: no, but that's always my goal.
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome|Busy: I know, right?
<Obsidian> Looks like someone took in a little too much caatus juice
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity, angering the crowds with his B movies.
<superretroworld> RAWRity: then i wonder who picked epic movie :D
<Fluttercry> 05,15My B movie is Fist of Fury AKA The Chinese Connection
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> RAWRity: So I guess you were the one that picked Epic Movie, right? :D
<RAWRity> people who purposefully pick terrible movies often don't have the balls to show up for their own films. Not me.
<otakon> well this is damn creepy
<LadyCanary> Someything.
<Bronysith> hehe, dethklok in equestria
<RAWRity> If Nudist Colony of the Dead gets picked, you best expect me to be here for the whole damn thing.
<Kurra> RAWRity, putting all his marbles in one shot, or all his eggs in one frying pan, or something like that.... @_@
<ASoftFluffyThing> My B movie is...god I forgot the name of it already....
<J_E_Smith71> Felidae's been my B since I joined (Well orignally it was my A but it was downgraded to B in July on the spreadsheet)
<Kurra> When I win the B movie, I'm just going to ask the Bronystate admins to stream two hours of C-Span.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Kurra, why?
<Tiberium126> BBBFF
<Fluttercry> 05,15not a movie. not elligible
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Would Kung Pow be considered a B movie?
<Cypresswolf> I'd like to come across such a creature in Myst
<Kurra> Because THEN, I'll forever have the dubious honor of picking worst movie that will ever be in the history of the universe.
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Yep
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Okay.
<otakon> and he DID
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome|Busy: That was my original B choice before Felidae got knocked back to B
<Kandarihu> J_E_Smith71, I'm somewhat concerned that a lot of people might be bored by my B-Movie choice. yours would be even more boring.
<Cypresswolf> although...I did meet Shroomie :)
<twilight_sprinkle> voting is closed now, right?
<Nittany_Discord> I put it as a B movie.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Okay.
<ASoftFluffyThing> I think my B movie choice was Piranha
<ASoftFluffyThing> The original one
<Fluttercry> 05,15twilight_sprinkle I haven't closed it yet. so if you're going to vote make it quick
<J_E_Smith71> Kandarihu: You've actually seen it?
<Cypresswolf> My B this week is Maximum Overdrive
<sub06905> Is a mayonnaise a B movie?
<Crystaline_Shard> Bird taunts you with food.
<twilight_sprinkle> Fluttercry: ok thanks, although i dont even know if im eligible to win twice in a row, am i?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *shrugs shoulders*
<thelonepony> The adorable creature is back
<Dovah> sub06905: yes, yes it is
<Kandarihu> J_E_Smith71, as in two hours of C-Span or my own choice of B-Movie?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: only for the thing you won last is all
<spitfirecolt> what game is this
<Cypresswolf> sub06905: by the sound of the title...Yes?
<twilight_sprinkle> o ok otakon
<otakon> it's Myst IIRC
<twilight_sprinkle> one sec then
<Fluttercry> 05,15You can win anything but the category you already won
<thelonepony> Mist IV
<twilight_sprinkle> ok ill vote quickly then
<Obsidian> spitfirecolt: Myst 4
<otakon> God a fourth one?
<twilight_sprinkle> one sec
<spitfirecolt> nice
<Kandarihu> Come to think of it, I guess my movie choice probably isn't really all that boring anyway.
<otakon> also WHAT is squeaking?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> So you can win all four categories? :D
<otakon> I do NOT trust the squeaking!
<ASoftFluffyThing> Fluttercry, do you have the link where we can vote?
<otakon> AJIsAwesome|Busy: yeah if you are REALLY lucky
<RAWRity> but yeah, I've actually got a NUMBER of movies lined up: Nudist Colony of the Dead, The Love Guru, Master of Disguise, The Asylum's Sherlock Holmes, The Incredible Bulk...
<Cypresswolf> When do we plunder Achenar's plunder?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> That's aweomse. :D
*Crystaline_Shard squaeks in otakon 's ear
<Obsidian> otakon: it was that bird dinosaur thing
<sub06905> Hopefully: Nothing To Lose, is a B movie
<otakon> AJIsAwesome|Busy: actually only 3 times, you only vote one pony ep
<Kandarihu> As an alternative to this, I also have a troll-choice for B-Movie that's not exactly a movie.
<Fluttercry> 05,15ASoftFluffyThing are you on the mailing list?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Oh, yeah.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Fluttercry, yes I am.
<J_E_Smith71> Kandarihu: Well you said my "choice would be more boring" so I was seeing if you actually saw Felidae before
<Fluttercry> 05,15Kandarihu if it's not a movie it can't be picked
<superretroworld> i dare someone to choose in the name of the king :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> I picked Chicken Run for my A :3 I love that movie
<twilight_sprinkle> ok i voted
<ASoftFluffyThing> Aardman FTW
<Crystaline_Shard> Never seen it/
<sub06905> chicken run <3
<AdamTheDuck> ASoftFluffyThing, /)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ASoftFluffyThing: Same here.
*Ponies47 Pokes the chat for no reason
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> OW!
<sub06905> o.o
<Kandarihu> Meh, fine. If that's the case, I might as well 'fess up about what it is. It's a 2 hour long Youtube video showing how to assemble a gaming computer.

*AdamTheDuck noms Ponies47
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> What was that for? :(

<Cypresswolf> what did I choose for A this week....
<ASoftFluffyThing> AdamTheDuck, AJIsAwesome|Busy (\
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Fluttercry Interstella 5555 counts ?
<Crystaline_Shard> Though if i do need a A list movie to pick. How to train your dragon looked good and I never seen it.
<twilight_sprinkle> i chose nothing for a movie
<ASoftFluffyThing> Owww Ponies47. My side :<<
<RAWRity> but yeah, my A movie for this week is Battle Royale
<Fluttercry> 05,15TheGreatAndPowerfulT yes
<Cypresswolf> Adventures of Milo & Otis
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Fluttercry as A or B ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would play that http://fav.me/d4u9itp
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Cypresswolf: That sounds familar..........
<Crystaline_Shard> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: YES YESSSSSSSS
<Fluttercry> 05,15not sure. I don't know much about budget or critical reception
<superretroworld> my A movie is dazed and confused
<ASoftFluffyThing> I remember what my B movie is now
<Crystaline_Shard> Fluttercry: it's a anime featuring a number of daft punk songs.
<otakon> HOLY SHIT!
<Fluttercry> 05,15I know that
<otakon> EPIC MUSIC!
<Tiberium126> CrimsonPhoenix, that game must be made
<J_E_Smith71> Well the reason I've been voting Felidae the whole time is that it's obscure and is unknown to people in the US (outside YouTube) and I want to see the chat response to it
<ASoftFluffyThing> Was the second Ace Ventura movie
<Mozdoc> Well that was sudden...
<otakon> OH SHIT!
<Crystaline_Shard> It's more B list then A list though it has a cult following.
<otakon> KILL IT WITH FIRE!
<Cypresswolf> :O Gremlin
<ASoftFluffyThing> What was that thing? It looked like a taller version of some elf creature thing.
*Bronysith puts a tonberry on otakon s face
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Fluttercry budget $4 million Rating: 7.7/10 still only 68 minutes long
<Kandarihu> Cult hits make for the best B Movies. Well, those and foreign blockbusters
<weeping_pegasi82> do you guys mined if I show you the new picture I did in Paint? (I used a mouse so it probably won''t be good)
<Obsidian> Follow the lemur?

<Fluttercry> 05,15I'd say B
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> weeping_pegasi82: Sure.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> PM it.
<superretroworld> i wonder if clerks is an A or B movie
<Cypresswolf> This reminds me of another game....something about a black panther....
<weeping_pegasi82> http://hyperion1997.deviantart.com/#/d5g73xg
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Good will vote for that next week
<J_E_Smith71> superretroworld: Clerks was shown recently
<J_E_Smith71> So you have to wait six months to vote for it
<thelonepony> looks neat weeping_pegasi82 :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> weeping_pegasi82: Very nice.
<Crystaline_Shard> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: so will i if I'm here :D
<Obsidian> Not bad weeping_pegasi82
<superretroworld> J_E_Smith71: ik, but i forget if it was a or b
<Cypresswolf> I want to rub their ears <3
<J_E_Smith71> I think it was B because it replaced that Samurai thing
<Tiberium126> weeping_pegasi82: have a look at the comments
<superretroworld> oh
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm going to get a proper art program and tablet in december
*Ponies47 Was bored at school so he sketched this http://ponies47.deviantart.com/#/d5g72fp
<J_E_Smith71> If Felidae ever wins, my next B choice will probably be The Wizard
<Shizuka> 13and now you know why the puzzles are stupid hard
<Cades> So some random person just walked into your house?
<FlutterMEDIC> J_E_Smith71: you talking about the one where that kid goes to a video game competition in California?
<Cypresswolf> Oh gosh...Felidae...not a bad movie, up to a certain point - distrubing though

<DerpyMuffins> Who is streaming?
<Cades> I saw a skylanders shirt at the mall a while ago. I kinda wanted to buy it
<sub06905|Gamecube> time to play the Super Mario Sunshine :3
<flutter_spin> SB
<Derpy_Hooves> NewSuperBronyU \:3/
<Rain> Crystaline_Shard you mean me? I've been around here for a long time.
<DerpyMuffins> Ahh, I wanted to brawl with him
<Cades> I didn't even fit me, so what's the point :p
<Kimori_Cookies> lol
<Crystaline_Shard> I'm new. Greetings.
<Kimori_Cookies> what was on the shirt?
<Rain> :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> hi Crystaline_Shard :)
*flutter_spin waves at Crystaline_Shard
<Cades> I think it was just a bunch of different characters
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Crystaline_Shard: Make sure to read the rules. :)
*HoodyNinja gives Crystaline_Shard a welcome bucket
<thelonepony> Chi Crystaline_Shard
<otakon> hmmm
<otakon> hiya NewSuperBronyU

<Kimori_Cookies> oh ok
<HoodyNinja> 15 lives?
*HoodyNinja grabs some popcorn
<NocturnalBlade> this kinda makes me wanna play lol
*HoodyNinja wishes he still had brawl...
<Crystaline_Shard> I dance around Like a idiot and troll them because I am very VERY good at dodging.
<flutter_spin> dat lalala
*HoodyNinja just hit stuff
<LunasGuard> *cant remember last time i played this*
<Yahooz> oh yeah, because the frame data of dodging is SO unpredictable :p
<RaveBrony> I wish i had brawl too... Ive only played the Wii like....3 times, for maybe 20 minutes each time :D
<TheMaster> what can you even do against a giant octopus?
<Crystaline_Shard> You underestimate how good I am at avoiding :D
<RaveBrony> ll it does is collect dust on my shelf
<RaveBrony> *All
<RaveBrony> LOL
<sub06905|Gamecube> mario needs more games with VA like Super mario sunshine :)
<superretroworld> does anybody hear play halo or gears online?
<weeping_pegasi82> I had this game... I was pretty good as Lucario
<HoodyNinja> RaveBrony: I'll take it from you
<flutter_spin> I still can't believe Zero Punctuation reviewed Guild Wars 2 with an oddly positive outlook
<superretroworld> sub06905|Gamecube: UNDERRATED GAME
<HoodyNinja> weeping_pegasi82: HOLEE SHEETO I'm not the only one!
<RaveBrony> HoodyNinja: NAh, family is hellbent on keeping it for some reason :D
<NocturnalBlade> weeping_pegasi82: i play gears with some friends in private games but not a lot online
<Princess_Celestia> what is this?
<flutter_spin> SB playing Super Smash
<Kimori_Cookies> Night
<Yahooz> BRAWL FUN FACT: using Jigglypuff's final smash in the crevice area just as its closing up will result in a cancelation of the FS animation, thus causing a permanent giant Jiggly Puff
<HoodyNinja> I miss my gears copies
<weeping_pegasi82> never had online access on the wii the game would have been a lot more fun if I had
<RDX|Sleep> Nighties
<Cades> cya rdx
<HoodyNinja> I knew that Yahooz
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Yahooz: I actually saw that as a picture and attempted that.
<HoodyNinja> :3

<flutter_spin> Last Nintendo console I had was ... well, Nintendo
<weeping_pegasi82> my brother was an expert as Snake so I got my but kicked everytime I faced him >: (
<Crystaline_Shard> lol.
<Princess_Celestia> I remember those tanks
<Shammy> i has that game in my ds still
<Crystaline_Shard> Advance wars
<Yahooz> BRAWL FUN FACT: These two need to use alot more back-air... seriously
<NocturnalBlade> BRAWL FUN FACT: if you have yoshi eat said giant jigglypuff you get a giant egg
<flutter_spin> That means I missed out on all the Mario games, Zelda games, and Metroid games
<Princess_Celestia> Advance Wars was amazeing
<Crystaline_Shard> lol nice SB
<Kandarihu> Dang, you guys better watch yourfooting with Final Smashes
<flutter_spin> What if SB is really playing his alter ego?
<HoodyNinja> Brawl fun fact: You CAN one-hit smaller characters if you fully charge a normal attack with Ike
<Crystaline_Shard> You mean Brawl Obvious fact :D
<Yahooz> BRAWL FUN FACT: Game and Watches judge move (B) is NOT randomnized. The humber is determined by which frame the move is initiated
<Yahooz> *number
<Crystaline_Shard> Derpy's getting nervious.
<HoodyNinja> and larger characters from 20%

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DAT POST :S
<Derpy_Hooves> Crystaline_Shard not really my laptop is starting to crash
<weeping_pegasi82> what would have been a cool feature was that in the pictochat arena you could connect your ds to it and just cause trouble for the players
<Crystaline_Shard> Oh wello Derpy_Hooves :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> What would've been cool was that they made LAN compatible with Melee.
<HoodyNinja> Yahooz: so you could KO anybody if you knew how?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I would've played that for years if it had LAN.
<HoodyNinja> Idk, something about playing fighting games with everyone in the same room just can't be replaced by LAN
<Yahooz> HoodyNinja: If done FRAME PERFECTLY, you can "choose" your desired number in that move. You can see this in some Brawl TASs

<Buytoast> anybody?
<Shizuka> 1340?
<Shizuka> 13no..
<HoodyNinja> It's a tie for me, only because of the smash feature in brawl
<Saigneur> what's the best character on smash bros melee ???
<[Alpha-Trinity]> ...
<Princess_Celestia> I ate 14 in a row
<twilight_sprinkle> tekken 5:dark resurrection didnt seem to have much imbalance, a lot of characters were pretty equal
<Princess_Celestia> I regreted it later
<HoodyNinja> I tried, but had to stop at 39
*Shizuka 13does not handle spice well
<twilight_sprinkle> *: dark
<Buytoast> man, them volcano tacos are good
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I've eaten 4 in a row but no more.
<Buytoast> i haven't had em since those 40 though
<Buytoast> taco bell still makes em right?
<Princess_Celestia> yes
<Kandarihu> I dig spicy food but I can barely handle several volcano tacos in close succesion, even theoretically
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT is tired of playing PIU
<Crystaline_Shard> Soul caliber massive imbalances :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^^^
<thelonepony> never had any Volcano tacos

<thelonepony> Night TheG- gone
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Two's pretty well regarded in balance
<Crystaline_Shard> I one hit kill with link
<Crystaline_Shard> :/
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Link was the worst character
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> He was?
<HoodyNinja> Buytoast: The fuck u say bout mah doritoes?
<Crystaline_Shard> fu link is awesome.
<Shizuka> 13help me ponies, whose hair do i want more http://i.imgur.com/bZkx0.jpg or http://i.imgur.com/g1jnk.jpg
<Buytoast> i said they're nasty
<Derpy_Hooves> im bad with peach
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, for some reason, he was considered to be the worst character
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Shizuka: Second.
<Princess_Celestia> http://i.imgur.com/g1jnk.jpg <- That one
<Yahooz> Shizuka: first
<Crystaline_Shard> I beat the whole game with him easy.
<Rain> Shizuka, first one :3
<HoodyNinja> Survey says number 2
<Yahooz> Rain says one so one it is
<LightTrooper105> and im back o.o
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Shizuka, why not both?
<Crystaline_Shard> Funny thing is hes the only one I could do it with :/
<[Alpha-Trinity]> yellow
<Yahooz> One is more real
<LunasGuard> Shizuka: go with http://i.imgur.com/g1jnk.jpg
<Crystaline_Shard> On hard anyway.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> SaxyPretender: That requires cloning. :P
<Crystaline_Shard> or extreame or w/e it's called
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Soul Calibur's an iffy thing because technically EVERYONE has a one hit kill due to ring outs
<HoodyNinja> I used Link and only Link in 2
<LunasGuard> Shizuka: go with the 2nd one
<HoodyNinja> Ring outs make it fun
<Crystaline_Shard> Saxy. Link has the most :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, Link was great for ring outs
<Crystaline_Shard> also the easyist to pull off.
<otakon> SaxyPretender: beware Astraroth
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and for getting through Weapon Master mode
<crazypony> http://i.imgur.com/g1jnk.jpg i like this one
<Crystaline_Shard> astra being my second best I mastered his combo that takes off half a health bar.
<Crystaline_Shard> :D
<HoodyNinja> Technically Shizu asked the chat and not Rain, but I guess you're right, Yahooz

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Soul Calibur V was gdlk
<Shizuka> 13nuuuuuuu
<Yahooz> btw, I kind of feel like explaining this anyway: Meta Knight is the best character in Brawl under unity ruleset essentially due to his excessive frame-safe options, such as planking, speed, and ridiculous gimping ability
<HoodyNinja> CK|Ded: WIll you at least tell me why you're dewad
<Crystaline_Shard> Yes AJIsAwesome|Busy
<otakon> Shizuka: but a cheapie is better than one that doesn't work right?

<Laurayne> 6_9
<Laurayne> Okay
<otakon> HoodyNinja: how is THAT a viable strategy? the Siren doesn't have ANY skills that enhance FFYL mode or work better when you're near death as far as I know.

<thelonepony> night Crystaline_Shard
<Crystaline_Shard> hopefully not so sick tommorrow
<HoodyNinja> otakon: NO! I get close to the enemy, but being incapped doesn't bother me
<Laurayne> You All Seem Very Friendly. Im Glad, I Usually Get Booted Out Of Chatrooms Or No One Talks To Me And I Just Leave... Its Pretty Hard For Me To Keep Up Since I Cant Read Too Fast With My Bad Eyes, Then I End Up Typeing Really Long Things.... Like This... :'(
<HoodyNinja> It just tends to happen
<CECtheRonin> otakon HoodyNinja Am I the only one who thought that Mark Meltzer's story was way more interesting than Delta's?
<otakon> CECtheRonin: no but considering Delta is very Mary Sue-ish I'm not surprised
<HoodyNinja> WHO the HELL is Mark Meltzer? I don't recall him
<otakon> HoodyNinja: yeah try KEEPING your distance
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: Use this website to help you: http://ponychat.net/faq/
<otakon> HoodyNinja: seriously it works wonders for survivability
<otakon> Even I do it as a Gunzerker
<Laurayne> What Is It?
<otakon> What is what?
<Laurayne> The Link...
<HoodyNinja> otakon: Also my main is now Zer0
<otakon> hiya Saturn
<Kurra> WAS IST DAS
<[Alpha-Trinity]> I'm mostly here just to past the time and this site has had an influence on me.....for the most part a good influence.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: It basically helps you with certain commands like /me and other stuff like that.
<otakon> HoodyNinja: well getting close is NOT a good idea unless you're going Bloodlust
<Kurra> ^
<otakon> HoodyNinja: the sniping tree is pretty doable however
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> [Alpha-Trinity]: Agreed.
<Kurra> ^
<Kurra> good influence yah indeed. Well 'cept sometimes when scary movies come on but.
<Kurra> cx
<HoodyNinja> otakon: I'm experimenting and trying to decide between Bloodlust and Cunning, but survivablity is still pretty good
*Kurra hides for those, goes eat cookies
*AJIsAwesome|Busy snags some cookies and dashes off
*HoodyNinja sits on AJIsAwesome|Busy
<[Alpha-Trinity]> Now I like to draw. I draw on paper, phone and tablet. I prefer pencil though I'm getting better at shading and sketching
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> HoodyNinja: :I
<CECtheRonin> HoodyNinja Mark Meltzer was a character who had a lot of audio files and appeared as a Big Daddy. His story was that he lived on the surface until a Big Sister came on land and took his daughter. Obsessed with finding her, he lost his marriage and almost his mind lookig for clues and slowly discovering Rapture before eventually going down there to find his daughter. Unfortunately, Sofia Lamb caught him and had
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Testing.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Nvm
<HoodyNinja> CECtheRonin: Oh that guy
<HoodyNinja> Yeah I loved him
*HoodyNinja feels stupid
<CECtheRonin> HoodyNinja I kinda wish the game was about him. And that you didn't have to do those stupid protection missions to rescue the Little Sisters.
<HoodyNinja> I love how the chat has nothing to do with the stream
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Be right back. Have to check on my bike.
<[Alpha-Trinity]> I still want to play Bioshock infinite
<HoodyNinja> Its just like background music at a casino
<Shizuka> 13it makes me worried nopony is watching..
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> I'm paying attention.
<HoodyNinja> CECtheRonin: I just killed the Little Sisters
<AJIsAwesome|AFK> Just working at the same time. :D
<thelonepony> i'm watching Shizuka
<HoodyNinja> STALKER^
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<otakon> Shizuka: no I'm watching I just have NO idea what you are trying to do is all.

<HoodyNinja> YESH Infinite comes out next year
<CECtheRonin> HoodyNinja Really? There wasn't? Aw man, that sucks.
*CECtheRonin hasn't finished the game yet
<HoodyNinja> CECtheRonin: I never found one
<[Alpha-Trinity]> It was supposed to come out this year....
<HoodyNinja> ^
<HoodyNinja> I don't care, long as the game is good
<CECtheRonin> Aww man, I was really excited for Infinite to come out before the world ended. :p

<otakon> brb need restroom
<[Alpha-Trinity]> I'm getting to old for this. I'm going to bed (I'm 17)
<Ponies47> Night [Alpha-Trinity]
<NocturnalBlade> nite [Alpha-Trinity]
<thelonepony> night [Alpha-Trinity]
<HoodyNinja> I have no idea what is going on
<HoodyNinja> All I know is I love it
<flutterchu> i got Fanny Evil leafy bomby dora lollipop and pie
<HoodyNinja> Details, details
<Shizuka> 13and then he gets really evil
<AwesomeSauce> what game is this?
<LunasGuard> (=_=)
<AwesomeSauce> i just got here
<otakon> Myst 4
*HoodyNinja sits on AwesomeSauce
<AwesomeSauce> thnks
<Dester> its 4hz
<AwesomeSauce> lol
<HoodyNinja> otakon: WB how was the shit?
<Dester> the frequency, that is
<otakon> HoodyNinja: non existant, took a wiz
*AJIsAwesome|AFK sits on HoodyNinja
<Shizuka> 13so basically this takes a bit of knowledge of the universe
*HoodyNinja makes a sit-stack
<Shizuka> 13the link in chamber is constructed of a material known as nara
<HoodyNinja> otakon: Did you hit the bowl?
<Dester> That's howa joke and frog are a like, if you disect it, it dies
<Shizuka> 13which is an ultra dense form of rock that puts diamond's hardness to shame
<otakon> HoodyNinja: no dammit
<Shizuka> 13sirrus has figured out that the crystals store energy and release it as a vibration when grounded
<HoodyNinja> I know dat feel bro
<HoodyNinja> NO
<Shizuka> 13so given the proper frequency, he can de-stabilize nara on a molecular level
<HoodyNinja> I DON'T WANT TO THINK
<Shizuka> 13and thus escape
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> YES
<otakon> HoodyNinja: NO I meant stop asking me sttuff like that
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> You WANT TO THINK
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hello?
<HoodyNinja> OH ok
<HoodyNinja> My bad :s
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Oh nvm
*HoodyNinja sits on AJIsAwesome|Busy
<Dester> Shizuka wouldnt you think instead that it would just, you know, go boom? like whAT HAPPENS when you destablize molecules?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> HoodyNinja: :I
<Shizuka> 13it's like he says
<Dester> I mean i get its a game
<Shizuka> 13it shatters like glass
<LunasGuard> lands on HoodyNinja
<Laurayne> I Just Finished Reading The Chat FAQ.. Thanks AJ For The Link
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> No problem. :)
<Shizuka> 13if you could vibrate at such a specific frequency, you could probably destabilize molecules in reality
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<Shizuka> 13it's just probably stupidly hard to find, sirrus is just lucky
<Shizuka> 13observe
<twilight_sprinkle> i dont think that works for most materials, though
*Laurayne Observes...
<Dester> shizuka that isn't posible because molecules have a rabbit ears ' random " motion when enegergized
*HoodyNinja sits patiently and waits
<otakon> still waiting
*AJIsAwesome|Busy watches in awe
<twilight_sprinkle> its not really that hard, im pretty sure they have instruments for creating verying sound effect with much precision
<LunasGuard> looks in aww
<Dester> all because of the nature of quanta
*HoodyNinja grabs some popcorn
<Laurayne> This Is All Way Over My Head...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> HoodyNinja: Pass the popcorn.
<Shizuka> 13so that's the rock frequency, but we need something with more power
<Shizuka> 13so
<otakon> so.......
<Dester> with bated breath
<twilight_sprinkle> Dester it sometimes works with glass, but yeah, usually its not possible
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> SO LA TI DO?
*HoodyNinja aims his popcorn cannon at AJIsAwesome|Busy
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :O
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *ducks and covers*
<Shizuka> 13derp it's contained
<HoodyNinja> otakon is unimpressed
*Laurayne See Popcorn Cannon
<otakon> did I miss it?
<Laurayne> yay~ :(
<otakon> I missed it didn't I?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ....
<Dester> twilight_sprinkle well if you vibrate molecules its called heat, you would need rapid heating/cooling to crack glass
*HoodyNinja gives AJIsAwesome|Busy some popcorn because the canon malfunctioned
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Oh. Thanks, HoodyNinja :D
<Polydunami> Well, this Twilight Sparkle theatre is looking a little... different.
<Shizuka> 13here we go
<Laurayne> Can I Have Some Popcorn Too...
<LunasGuard> http://ts3.mm.bing.net/images/thumbnail.aspx?q=4806816464765922&id=aad6d68b32402ba687c6d4a00d791425
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Polydunami: Side theaters are only active on BMN.
<Dester> Physicsn Brony, Away! (well not really away)
*HoodyNinja fires his popcorn cannon at Laurayne
<twilight_sprinkle> Dester not necessarily, im talking pure sound. even the mythbusters did it, which says its not hard to do
<Polydunami> I was talking about the page itself, AJIsAwesome|Busy
<HoodyNinja> to many smart people in here
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> HoodyNinja: But you said it malfuntioned. :(
*Laurayne Is Burried In Popcorn 6_9
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome|Busy: I LIED!
<Polydunami> I'm guessing this is something to do with the Myst series.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :O
<Dester> well thats hitting a resonance frequency, not energising molecules
<twilight_sprinkle> Dester i thought thats what they meant in the game
<LunasGuard> *eats fired popcorn*
<Shizuka> 13ready for a ride?
<HoodyNinja> Don't fall off
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Yes
<Polydunami> And just in time too; I just got in a couple of minutes ago :3
<sub06905|Gamecube> eating hot cheetos with tapitio is taking a toll on my stomach :S
<Dester> Weee!

<HoodyNinja> of course its a gamers diet
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> sub06905|Gamecube: oh.
<Shizuka> 13remember these colors
<Dester> HoodyNinja yeah, so?
<Shizuka> 13they will be important later
<doctor_whooves127> ok
<Laurayne> I Prefer Lemon Iced Tea Over Junk Food...
<HoodyNinja> purple green teal red teal green
<sub06905|Gamecube> lemon ice tea <3
<HoodyNinja> now copy paste for later
<Dester> I got nutella for my junk food
<LunasGuard> me bad memory
<Laurayne> Which Reminds Me... Brb...

<HoodyNinja> Purple at 8 o clock
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I could never get into tea.
<Polydunami> That's two greens and two teals side by side. Purple is on the left and Red is on the right.
<HoodyNinja> going clockwise
<sub06905|Gamecube> Cranberry juice <3
<flutterchu> i have some people who signed up on my show (3
<Dester> HoodyNinkja that sounds like a hipster band name
<Polydunami> Oh, why did I capitalise red there? :S
<Dester> purple at 8 0 clock
<flutterchu> i need to wait till it's complete
<HoodyNinja> Dester: Faded Paint
<Maid_RainBow> dat book

<HoodyNinja> You can make band names by looking at an ordinary classroom
<Dester> that rales are fun?
<Laurayne> Im Back
<twilight_sprinkle> screaming and hollering
<Kurra> raaa.
<Shizuka> 13we learned that achenar started repenting when he found the wildlife in his age was starting to like him
<flutterchu> Shizuka: that it's always harder than it looks
<HoodyNinja> that Vivi is our lord and master?
<doctor_whooves127> sound is powerfull?
<Shizuka> 13we learned that sirrus is evil and concocted a plan to bust out of spire
<Shizuka> 13BUT!
<Shizuka> 13why take yeesha
<Laurayne> I Learned.... That Iced Tea Goes Right Threw Me...
<Polydunami> I knew it; this is the Myst series.
<Shizuka> 13also yes
<HoodyNinja> I Learned That I Don't Have The Fingers For This
*Ponies47 Looks at clock
<Dester> i learned that ice tea is on law and oprder
<Shizuka> 13vivi and i can destabilize your molecules with wub
<flutterchu> join my battle for everything camp.........if that's okay with you
<Dester> order*
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ........
<Maid_RainBow> Myth?
<HoodyNinja> Alright bet

<HoodyNinja> Pip Piplup!
<Shizuka> 13not a capture card
<Shizuka> 13scrcap
<Shizuka> 13but more importantly it forces 640x480 resolution
<sub06905|Gamecube> there are pokemon in the chat o.o
<Shizuka> 13can't run windowed
<HoodyNinja> Damn, I have to go to sleeps, later

<flutterchu> I thought i was only half pokemon
<Shizuka> 13can't alt-tab
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Please take the RP somewhere else, please.
<Shizuka> 13that and games that force screen one to change screw up screen two
<Dester> Ash: get back in your poke ball
*Laurayne Sits And Eats Poke'Snacks...
<flutterchu> whatever
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Just saying.
<Polydunami> Well, that's just dandy :|
<Polydunami> :3
<Ponies47> Gah and the chat derped out on me. Did any one ping me before like about 30 sec ago?
<Polydunami> Well we still have Myst to explore.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: Nope.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Not that I can remember.
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Must of been another chat
<Polydunami> If there's one thing Monty Python taught me...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: I think it was HoodyNinja.
<Polydunami> Always look on the bright side of life
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: He asked where do you get all that bread.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^^
<twilight_sprinkle> egawd, a human
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome|Busy: I made it myself with wubs :3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :O
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: I made gold when I tried wubs. :(
*Laurayne Wonders What Her Cutie Mark Would Look Like...
<Dester> Random, thought, If Cadence is a princess and celestia is a princess (niece of celestia) and luna is a princess, who is this incestous Queen?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Incestuous Queen? :S
<Dester> niece is a princess, hence must be a daughter, and celestia is a princess
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I never thought of it that way. :S
<Dester> weird right?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> That's...........interesting?
<Laurayne> Dester Has A Point...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I guess it still needs to be explained later on.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> If they do, of course.
<Polydunami> In a kids show?
<twilight_sprinkle> Faust is the queen
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Kind of like AJ at the family reunion.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> She has family all over Equestria.
<Dester> Its also kind of odd how Celestia is kind of like Alexander the Great of equestria
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> for all we know, Celestia might have other sisters. I don't know.
<Polydunami> You kidding, Dester? I mean, she'd be conquering countries left and right if that were the case
<Dester> we never hear of another county
<Polydunami> Trottingham?
<Dester> she took down discord and took power that was not hers rightly
<Laurayne> Im Wondering... Why Are There So Many Princesses... No King Or Queen... And No Princess... You Would THink After 1000 Or So Years She Would Find Someone....
<Laurayne> Princes?
<Dester> Laurarne rigicide i guess
<Dester> Laurayne*
<Laurayne> How Do You Make Prince A Plural And Have It Not look Like Princess?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> The main reason she's a princess is that Lauren thought that the Queen title would seems too harsh, so she named her Princess Celestia instead.
<Ponies47> I'll most likely be on a for a few hours before I hit the road
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: Princes?
<Dester> Princessess is the proper pluralization
<Ponies47> tomorrow :3
<Polydunami> Princesses*
<Dester> i believe
<Laurayne> :P
<Dester> yeh, one too many s's
<Cades> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/9/25/N8UukVJckk6PzEufWY9blA2.gif
*Laurayne Goes Cross Eyed
<Shizuka> 13SPY!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> SPAI!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> SPAI IN DEH BASE!
<Polydunami> Lots of princesses in culture in general
<Cades> well never mind, it's all laggy
<Laurayne> Spy?
*Laurayne Look sRound For A Spy
<Polydunami> I mean, fictional works in particular
<Shizuka> 13SPY SAPPIN MAH... WHATEVER THAT IS
<Dester> but yeh, the mother of celestia must have been erm, CLOSE with family or cadence would simply be her sister, and as we know, she's a niece. okay, i got that off my chest, i feel better now
<Laurayne> Maybe Shes Princess Of A Different Area...?
<Dester> I'll see y'all in an hour, I need to go shower
<Laurayne> I Didnt Get That Far In The Series Yet... :'(
<Dester> of a country we never see and is lives in canterlot?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I doubt that any of the sisters are incestuous. I'm guessing that Celestia has sisters but hasen't told them about them. I don't know.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *other sisters
<Polydunami> Luna?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> We just have to wait.
<Dester> not saying the sister's are incestous, i mean the mother was, or something, anyway its just weird
<Dester> weird
<Polydunami> Other than Luna, AJIsAwesome|Busy?
<Dester> by
<Shizuka> 13nice hair
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Polydunami: Maybe. I HAVE NO IDEA. Just putting out a theory.
<Laurayne> I Wonder What Their Names Would Be... Celestia.. Luna.. Uhmm... Solstice...?
<otakon> The hell is on her face?
<Polydunami> She looks a little like Billie Piper :3
<LunasGuard> live action?
<otakon> Well anyway I'm out of here for the night
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night, otakon :)
<otakon> Shizuka: thanks for the stream
<Laurayne> Goodnight
<LunasGuard> later otakon
<sub06905|Gamecube> bao otakon
<otakon> night AJIsAwesome|Busy, night all take care I'll see you tonight at BMN for sure
<sub06905|Gamecube> bai*

<Laurayne> Thank You :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Shizu stream.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Myst 4
<Laurayne> I Could Never Get Into The Myst Games...
<Polydunami> I've never even played a Myst game :S
<Laurayne> Which Is Strange... Because It Seems Like A Game Im Usually In To...
<Polydunami> I've seen them played...
<Laurayne> Lately Though, Ive Been Really Into The Command And Conquer Games... Thoough Im Not Very Good... Ive Never Won An Online Match...
<Laurayne> Maybe One Day If I Figure out How, Ill Stream A Match On Here... If That Would Be Okay...
*AJIsAwesome|Busy uses Ubercharge on chat
<Polydunami> Bah. I have nothing to say at all :S
<Laurayne> Thats Team Fortress 2 Term, Yes? From Medic?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Yes. :$
*Polydunami doesn't play Team Fortress 2 :3
<Laurayne> Ive Played It Alittle... Though Im Not Any Good At That Game Either...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I'm trying to get it, but I have to clear up a TON of space.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Plus with updates, it's going to take a LOT of time.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Figured just getting a terabyte hard drive, transferring all my data there, downloading TF2, and then just switching it back.
<Laurayne> I Love This Background Music...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Wait, I meant terabyte USB port.
<LunasGuard> well night everypony
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night, LunasGuard :)
<Laurayne> Goodnight
<Polydunami> Good night, LunasGuard
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> That way I can keep TF2 on a USB port and my old data on my harddrive.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Either that or just upgrading my harddrive.
<Polydunami> How much memory do you need to PLAY TF2? :S
<Shizuka> 13HEAVY IS SPY
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Polydunami: Over 10 GB.
<Polydunami> Oh. That all?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I have 60GB space.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I have 1/10 of GB memory left.
<Laurayne> My Father's Computer Has A 600GB HDD
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: Lucky.
<Polydunami> We once had a 2GB computer.
<Laurayne> And 6GB RAM
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I think I'm better off just getting a terabyte harddrive.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Anyone know how much terabyte hard drives go for these days?
<Ninjazz> Hello everyone.
<Polydunami> My laptop currently holds about 283 GB.
<Laurayne> Not That Expensive
<Polydunami> Hey, Ninjazz!
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Ninjazz
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, Ninjazz :)
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsAwesome|Busy, not much, half a terabyte was $50 for me
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> AdamTheDuck: WHAT?! :O
<Polydunami> And I have about 233 GB of free space
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> HALF FOR 50$?!
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsAwesome|Busy, eeyup, or might have been a bit more, I can't remember :$
<Laurayne> Nowdays, A Terabyte USB HDD Is About $60 I Think
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Looks like I have some shopping to do. :D
<Laurayne> I Might Be Wrong THough
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Thanks, guys. :$
<Maid_RainBow> seems like there was water one time in there
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: I've seen 5TB's go for almost $100.
<AdamTheDuck> I remember the days when 4 gig usb's were the biggest you could get :$
<Laurayne> 5TBs.... Youd Almost Never Need Another HDD...
<weeping_pegasi82> my laptop holds 451 GB of space... I'm currently using 257 GB of it and I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S TAKING UP SO MUCH SPACE
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> SHEESH, that's alot.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I really need to upgrade.
<Polydunami> Do you have iTunes, weeping_pegasi82?
<weeping_pegasi82> yah
<weeping_pegasi82> oh...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Doesn't Itunes take up a LOT of space?
<Shizuka> 13DAMMIT ATRUS
<Shizuka> 13YOU HAD ONE JOB
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ONE!
<Shizuka> 13FOLLOW THE PRIME DIRECTIVE
<Shizuka> 13BUT NOOOOOOOOO

<Ninjazz> SHIZURAGE.
<Laurayne> lol
<weeping_pegasi82> I'm wondering if itunes is worth it... my brother's classic rock is the only thing on it...
<AdamTheDuck> Haha :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I actually never saw SB rage until last night. :D
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsAwesome|Busy, SB RAGED?!?
<AdamTheDuck> Noooooo I missed it
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It was the almost final level of Rayman Origins.
<Polydunami> Must have been after I left, AJIsAwesome|Busy. Damn
*Ponies47 Looks at the clock agian and facehoofs hard
<Ninjazz> SB rages are smart.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: GO TO BED. :D
<Ninjazz> Not just ragy.
<Ninjazz> Like... complainy rage.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ninjazz: True.
<Laurayne> Ive Never Seem Itelectual Rage Before...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Very true.
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, http://derpy.me/giQ3X
<Polydunami> Wow, intellectual rage?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: It's actually quite interesting.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> One of my favorite kinds of rages.
<Laurayne> Ill Bet
<weeping_pegasi82> anybody know of a free music player?
<AdamTheDuck> AJIsAwesome|Busy, aww was that raging? I thought he just seemed fustrated
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Yeah think? Also crazy Twilgiht FTW <3
<Ponies47> *Twilight
<Polydunami> "No sleep" is for the weak
<Laurayne> VLC Player Is Really Good
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> AdamTheDuck: More frustrated than anything.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> BUt I have to agree with him: that level WAS CHEAP.
<Ninjazz> Hence SB rage.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> INCREDIBLY CHEAP.
<Ninjazz> Since it's the closest thing to it.
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah I guess that is rage...
<Ponies47> Ok I go to bread for real now
<Ponies47> Good night
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night.
<AdamTheDuck> But I still haven't seen SB go *flip table* rage yet...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> MAKE SURE YOU GO TO BED.
<Laurayne> Goodnight
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Ponies47
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> AdamTheDuck: I'm not sure if he ever will.
<Polydunami> Good night, Ponies47 :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Can't see him doing that.
<AdamTheDuck> He doesn't seem like the type of guy to raise his voice or such
<AdamTheDuck> That's why I like him XD
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^
<Shizuka> 13calling it now, i get a water guide
<Shizuka> 13i've never had the others
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Never?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hm.
<Panda> HOLY CARP! Shizuka is still streaming???
<Shizuka> 13eeeeeeryp
<Ninjazz> Watcha playin' Shizu?
<durger> is this Myst3?
<Polydunami> 4, actually
<weeping_pegasi82> The Jayhawks, Rob Zombie, Van Halen, U2, The Rolling Stones, The White Stripes.... I think my brother was obsessed with classic rock...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Panda: SB streamed and she took over after.
<durger> ah
<Panda> AJIsAwesome|Busy oh.
<Ponies47> I'll most likely be on a little bit before I head out :3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: :I
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ponies47: SLEEP.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> NOW.
<AdamTheDuck> weeping_pegasi82, buy some Nicki Minaj to fuck with him :D
*Ponies47 Jumps into his bed and goes the (squee) to sleep
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> THANK YOU. :D
<Ponies47> zzzzzzzzzz
*DuskStarshimmer|sad| sneaks int Ponies47s bed
<DuskStarshimmer|sad|> c:
<Shizuka> 13anyway
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DuskStarshimmer|sad|: :I
<Shizuka> 13yeah saw it coming that i would get water again
<Shizuka> 13i'm pretty sure it picks based on how fast you get to this part
<weeping_pegasi82> AdamTheDuck: he left, I got his laptop. He won't be getting it back >: )
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> What other type of guides can you get?
<Shizuka> 13air and fire
*Ponies47 Huggles DuskStarshimmer as he falls asleep
<Shizuka> 13fire i believe you only get if you beeline straight here
<NocturnalBlade> nite Ponies47
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> WOw.
*AdamTheDuck noms on Ponies47 while he sleeps ._.
<DuskStarshimmer> .me snuggles Ponies47 while he sleeps :3
<Shizuka> 13water you get if you take your time getting to this point
<DuskStarshimmer> o.o
<Ponies47> :3
<Shizuka> 13air is somewhere in the middle i think
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ok.
<Shizuka> 13the general idea being water flows around problems and is patient, fire burns straight through
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Makes sense.
<Shizuka> 13far as i know anyway, i just know i've even TRIED to get the other two guides, water every single time
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, that's interesting ^
<Laurayne> SEE?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> That sucks.
<Laurayne> That Looks Like Twilights Magic Book.... To Me Anyway...
<weeping_pegasi82> AJIsAwesome|Busy: what are busy with? it's been on your username forever

<AdamTheDuck> Indeed Laurayne
<Laurayne> I Love Good BGM
<Shizuka> 13and there was a fire guide
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I'm considering taking up acoustic guitar.
<Panda> You would think that Shizuka gets fire, seeing she is a Pyro incarnation.
<Shizuka> 13but i'm not looking for them, i'm looking for the waters
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ah.
<weeping_pegasi82> play the cello its fun :$
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Maybe.
<Laurayne> I Play Drums... Im Told Im Pretty Good At It...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I've played the violin for a couple of years, but had to drop it because of school getting in the way.
<weeping_pegasi82> my class is playing Danse Macabre and Fiddler on the Roof...
<Shizuka> 13dammit...

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Dester: ALWAYS wanted to play the saxophone.
<Dester> and eveyone play the guitar, its kind of cliche now
<weeping_pegasi82> AJIsAwesome|Busy: do you have your own piano or do you have a keyboard?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> weeping_pegasi82: Both. I play keyboard more.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> My actual piano is out of tune. :D
<Laurayne> Has Anyone Ever Seen The Full Live Performce Of The Epic Sax Guy Thing...?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> So I settled on a keyboard.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: I haven;t.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *haven't

<Panda|Sleepies> night
<Shizuka> 13so apparently
<Shizuka> 13there's an ARG in black mesa
*DoctoDoctorWho hugs everypony
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night Panda|Sleepies ;)
<Panda|Sleepies> THERE IS?
<Shizuka> 13http://thepizzaisalie.wikia.com/wiki/Code_C see that video on the side, that's me! :D
<Shizuka> 13i didn't even know it was getting so big <3
<Laurayne> Theres A Pirate In Black Mesa...?
<OneTrickPony> Shizuka: almost 2000 veiws
<Panda|Sleepies> Shizuka O_O holy poop you are famous!
<Shizuka> 131500
<Shizuka> 13i think it is only because i was the first to video it
<OneTrickPony> I was rounding up
<Shizuka> 13a redditor beat me to the discovery by a few hours 6_9
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :O
<OneTrickPony> oh redditors
<OneTrickPony> they so silly
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im wearing a suit today!
<Panda|Sleepies> Shizuka, wait a second... how the hell did you get that image out of a sound file?
<Shizuka> 13http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackMesaSource/comments/zysx7/the_black_mesa_source_arg/c690t7t
<Shizuka> 13SSTV
<Laurayne> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_Mz0t3MjBA
<Panda|Sleepies> Shizuka forgive me, but I'm not very smart with that. What is it?
<Shizuka> 13SSTV is a format for converting a picture into sound
<DoctoDoctorWho> the mares at my school dont stand a chance;)
<Shizuka> 13specifically the bleeps in the video
<Panda|Sleepies> Shizuka... so... I can convert an image into sound and vice versa?
<Shizuka> 13back when we were building up for Portal 2's announcement, Portal was updated to have a bunch of radios, some played morse, others played random beeps
<Shizuka> 13ARG players worked out they were SSTV transmissions, decoded into pictures that spun off into all kinds of weird ways
<Crystaline_Shard> If you converted them into a imgae you got spoilers
<Panda|Sleepies> hm....
<Shizuka> 13any case, once you've heard SSTV, it's really obvious when you hear one
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome|Busy: I get to wear a suit to school today
<Panda|Sleepies> So how do I get a hold of this program Shizuka?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DoctoDoctorWho: Cool!
<Shizuka> 13so bumming around the BMS files i came across the odd man out qecode.mp3 (everything else is wav), and lo and behold it was SSTV
<Shizuka> 13threw it into the decoder and got a piece of the ARG i didn't know was happening :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome|Busy: so you live in georgia?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Nope.
<OneTrickPony> yay now back to studying mandarin
<Panda|Sleepies> Shizuka... what program is it? i wanna tweak around with it :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Back to my music report. :D
<Crystaline_Shard> Shizuka: Because Valve is fucking clever like that.
<Shizuka> 13not valve this time though :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome|Busy: It seems I am mistakin, which state r u from then?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Texas.
<Shizuka> 13valve hasn't learned how to manage ARGs either
<OneTrickPony> AJIsAwesome|Busy: have fun :)
<Shizuka> 13the ARG around the pyro update was supposed to take weeks
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome|Busy: austin?
<Shizuka> 13it was solved in hours
<Crystaline_Shard> If not the ones who did it they had a hand in it. after all it is their game.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I'll probably move up north after I graduate.
<Shizuka> 13not valve's game, the BMS team did everything from scratch
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DoctoDoctorWho: Arlington.
<DoctoDoctorWho> cool
<Crystaline_Shard> Valve made portal :/
<Shizuka> 13well yes
<Shizuka> 13as cute as the portal 2 arg was getting all the indies involved, the payoff was crap
<OneTrickPony> Crystaline_Shard: Valve made everything that exists now and everything that will exist
<Crystaline_Shard> OneTrickPony: has it right.
<OneTrickPony> XD
<Crystaline_Shard> They are currently fighting google over the souls lost playing Runescape.
<DeathStar> my dad plays Runescape ><
<Panda|Sleepies> WHAT!

<Panda|Sleepies> Shizuka, can I show you a video?
<DeathStar> Panda|Sleepies: he dose... he stoped for a bit but he got back into it recently now he has a laptop
<Shizuka> 13k
<OneTrickPony> ugh, now I have to go in 30 mins early for mandarin
<Crystaline_Shard> oh right finding the radios and getting them to emit the code was a challange in it's self useually in some out of the way spot in the level it's a challange for a steam badge.
<Dr_Fumbles> You know what really grinds my gears? Dentists.
<Shizuka> 13yup
<Shizuka> 13any case
<Shizuka> 13sleep time
<Panda|Sleepies> Shizuka >.> nvm

*cowers cowers in the corner
<MadSurge> :D
*AJIsAwesome|Busy cowers in the corner
<OneTrickPony> how do I add myself to another channel?
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: yes but how are you planing to unite the world? what sort of system will your government be run under. and historicly it works best if you get into politics first and gain followers that way and then take over
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02OneTrickPony '/join #nameofchannel'
<OneTrickPony> k thnx
<OneTrickPony> aww I failed
<tSparx> DeathStar: get into the military* first
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Anyone knowthe track name of the music that plays before you get a star in SUper Mario Galaxy? It's calm and peaceful.
<DoctoDoctorWho> "Indeed, the very process of construction and creation foreshadow destruction and decay. The palace of today is tomorrow's ruin, the maiden of the morning is the crone of the night, and the hope of a moment is but the foundation stone of everlasting regret."
<tSparx> DeathStar: :P
<tSparx> */"I am become death, destroyer of worlds."/*
<DeathStar> tSparx: not nessesary that actualy adds more steps. politics is the way to go
<tSparx> DeathStar: Alexander Magnus, Genghis Khan, and Napoleon would all beg to differ, though Hitler would agree, and certainly some other people, just no one's coming to mind.
<DoctoDoctorWho> see this master, they are all fools. they know not the true path and like sheep to a sheperd, we shall unite them
<NewSuperBronyU> 01,04DAWN OF THE 15TH DAY - 1224 Hours Remain...
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<DeathStar> tSparx: in modern times politics is more relevent and more influendial than the military
*AdamTheDuck shits bricks
<DeathStar> NewSuperBronyU: ^_^

<DoctoDoctorWho> even the strongest amongst them stand not a chance, for how could they stand against us when they're too busy killing eachother?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Moo \:3/
*OneTrickPony devours all the children
*AJIsAwesome|Busy waddles into corner and sits down.
<tSparx> DeathStar: Oh well no on that I truly disagree. In certain situations, in certain cultures, at certain times in the modern era, sure, but in other situations/cultures/times absolutely not; it's not that clear-cut.
*NewSuperBronyU glomps AJIsAwesome|Busy
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> NewSuperBronyU: :(

<DeathStar> tSparx: maybe but for taking over the world, going the military way is less effective and takes much longer

<MadSurge> Shake shake shake, shake shake shake...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DAMMIT :|
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: I never said they would know, but you clearly need to learn more about psycology. when given a common enamy humans will work together even if temorarily to take down the common threat
<OneTrickPony> AJIsAwesome|Busy: is it due tommorow
<LightTrooper105> o.o..
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> OneTrickPony: Yes. :D
<OneTrickPony> AJIsAwesome|Busy: yay for procrastination!
*DeathStar dances on MadSurge s head
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> OneTrickPony: /)
<OneTrickPony> AJIsAwesome|Busy: (\
<tSparx> DeathStar: What makes you say that? We don't exactly have an data on most effective ways to take over the world
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Have some relaxing music. :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AManXblFRY0
<DeathStar> tSparx: maybe you don't
<MadSurge> DeathStar: don't worry about my hair, they're like Pinkie's and are always a mess :D
*Laurayne Yawns
<LightTrooper105> MadSurge in a good way or bad way?
<DeathStar> MadSurge: pinkies hair is not a mess it's just curly there's a difference
<tSparx> DeathStar: Ooh ooh, please, tell me, who takes over the world in the future? Is it the Japanese!? I want it to be the Japanese!
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02I understood today that Phospholipids consist of two fatty acids that are estericized to a backbone molecule, typically Gylcerol, that then has a group attached to the third carbon molecule that is the Phosphate group and then attached to a head group that differs and identifies the specific phospholipid type :D
<MadSurge> LightTrooper105: good way! :D
<LightTrooper105> Science...
<DeathStar> tSparx: I'm not a psycic!
<AdamTheDuck> For science~
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I already knew that.
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: I understand that already, my plan revolves around setting them on eachother and simply cleaning up when they are weak
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I took AP Biology. :O
<OneTrickPony> NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: no, NOT BIOLOGY!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *:P
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02Just remember...
<MadSurge> DeathStar: mine are curly too, but they look like a mess too :D
<tSparx> DeathStar: Well then where did you amass this data on taking over the world if you're not a psychic or a time-traveler?
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02Bonds don't store energy ^_^
<DeathStar> tSparx: lots of free time ^^;
<OneTrickPony> bonds transfer energy
<DoctoDoctorWho> NewSuperBronyU|Zzz: I understood all of that
<LightTrooper105> http://derpy.me/z1Onr
<tSparx> DeathStar: No one's ever taken over the world before, how could you know the best ways to go about it?
<MadSurge> Science Woona :3
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: that could work, but how are you planing to deal with resistance after?
<OneTrickPony> mfw science http://mlfw.info/f/8055/
<LightTrooper105> lol
<DeathStar> tSparx: well you can look at how far people have gone, wich systems are easyest to exploit a touch of human psycology works too
<Laurayne> I Was Good At Science In School...
<OneTrickPony> I am meh at science
<OneTrickPony> I am good at physics and chemistry though
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: once my forces own the planet, it merely becomes a war of atrition, I beat down resistance where it rises and no matter what you say or belive they will eventually stop and see that life isnt all that bad under me
<MadSurge> What does the expression "dog and pony show" mean anyway?
<LightTrooper105> i use to love science..
<Laurayne> I Have A Question...
<OneTrickPony> if only http://mlfw.info/f/7775/
<taoumi> what has science done
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: but what exactly are you planing to do with the world once you've taken over, that seems unclear
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: not to mention I have already figured out biological immortality
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: ah that saves the problem of hairs and succsesors
<Laurayne> Mickey Mouse Is A Mouse, Yes? And Donald Duck Is A Duck, And Goofy is A Dog...?
<MadSurge> Laurayne: yep
<Laurayne> Then How Come Pluto Is The Only One Who Is Actually A Dog...? Is He The "Special" One?
<MadSurge> Pluto is just dumb and doesn't realize he could talk and wear clothes :D
<LightTrooper105> Laurayne... Cartoon
<tSparx> DeathStar: Speculation then, not fact. The only thing I'd consider semi-scientific is looking at history, and the biggest territories I can think of were gained militarily: the Persian Empire, the Macedonian Empire, the Roman Empire, the Napoleonic Empire, the Mongol Empire... the only counter-example I can think of is the Islamic Empire, born of Political and Social pressure.
<Crystaline_Shard> Logic in a cartoon? you must be new here.
<Laurayne> Im Sorry, I Thought It Was A Funny Joke...
<LightTrooper105> funny thing is Mickey Mouse is half naked..
<tSparx> DeathStar: Not that I think there's anything wrong with speculation -- I'm a theologian after all, lol.
<LightTrooper105> oh god there goes my childhood..
<Laurayne> Donald Duck Doesnt Wear Pants....
<DeathStar> tSparx: of corse it's only speculation, but it's only that untill one puts it into practise
<tSparx> The ponies don't usually wear clothes
<LightTrooper105> don't ruin my dam childhood...
<OneTrickPony> I dont wear pants :3
<Crystaline_Shard> Donald duck moonlight's as a flasher.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Donald Duck was banned in Finland because he doesn't wear pants.
<MadSurge> REALLY? :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Yep "D
<LightTrooper105> dam o.o
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *:D
<tSparx> Alright, into Hw mode
*Laurayne Curls Up With My Picture Of Rainbow Dash <3
<LightTrooper105> Dashie..
<LightTrooper105> MLD...
*AJIsAwesome|Busy stills needs to read a fanfic
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *still
<MadSurge> Celestia is not a monster, dammit
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I've never read one.
<DeathStar> no bad LightTrooper105 don't make me think of that! :'(
<LightTrooper105> DeathStar I can't help it Dx
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> MadSurge: Not really a monster, but just enforcing the law she upholds.
<MadSurge> Nightmare Moon, Discord and Chrysalis are evil!
<DeathStar> LightTrooper105: no I can't help dancing, you can controll what you type
<Crystaline_Shard> Molestia Trollestia.
<Crystaline_Shard> :/
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> As attached as they are, RD can;t stay with him forever.
<Laurayne> I Think Rainbow Dash And Applejack Make A Good Pair...
<LightTrooper105> DeathStar I type with my mouth moving Dx
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I don't ship.
<DeathStar> Laurayne: of friends
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> But if you do, more power to you.
*Crystaline_Shard drops a boat on AJ three times.
<DeathStar> LightTrooper105: ....odd... I type with my fingers moving
<Laurayne> DeathStar: Sure, If Thats How You Want To See It...
<Laurayne> lol
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It's not my style.
<Crystaline_Shard> Name the game referance and get a prize.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im terribly sorry, Omega level chat derp
<DeathStar> Laurayne: yes that is ^_^
<DoctoDoctorWho> what happened?
<LightTrooper105> DeathStar sorry I ment was when I talk my I type what im saying... even If I don't want it too
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Nothing much.
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: well part of what happend was you didn't answer my question ^^;
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: what were you saying? I underwent omega derp
<DeathStar> LightTrooper105: that's.... interesting....
<tSparx|Hw> If I were to ship anything, which I don't, but, y'know, from an outside perspective looking in, Rainbow and Pinkie seem like a reasonable ship (well, most ships are reasonable but)
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: I was asking you what exactly you where going to do with the world once you've taken over. you're not very specific about that
<DeathStar> tSparx|Hw: hmmm, I don't see it personaly. but alright
<Laurayne> http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w247/magnus1114/552120-20applejack20dream20fluttershy20human20madmax20rainbow_dash20rarity20twilight_sparkle.jpg
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: first off, there is the fact that admittedly I am a bit of a greedy bastard so...
<DoctoDoctorWho> the world looks pretty good from here
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: what do you mean?
<tSparx|Hw> DeathStar: I can understand shipping Rainbow with any of the mane6, honestly
<MadSurge> Laurayne: oh god, I just watched inception yesterday D:
<LightTrooper105> o-o...
<DoctoDoctorWho> second off, I plan on leading mankind into a new age of prosperity, the next step is space. I've already figured out the terraformation of mars:)
<Laurayne> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/096/2/9/rainbow_dash_and_applejack_by_smittyg-d3ddjxo.png <3
<DeathStar> tSparx|Hw: I don't see many of them being lasting relation ships though. maybe rainbow and apple jack could work long term and rainbow and fluttershy MIGHT work at a streach rainbow and rarity, but i don't see the others working out
<DoctoDoctorWho> and about my first point, Im also doing it for the money
<DeadpoolDash> poo
<MadSurge> That should be *pomf* Laurayne :D
<Crystaline_Shard> Theres a good fanfict out there with the mane 6 not shipped together but because of a magic mirror Flutterdash Rarijack and Pinkietwi get kids so the whole story revolves around protecting the kids untill they figure out what to do with them and stuffs because the mirror belongs to a old god. and stuffs.
<Laurayne> Hehe
<DeadpoolDash> You know who is the buttest? I'm the buttest.
<OneTrickPony> holy crap this is good http://dawkinsia.deviantart.com/art/Chrysalis-Cadance-with-rapunzel-style-298230073
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: how are you planing on taking man kind into a new age of prosperity, and what's the point in you having money? if you rule the world you can have whatever you like for free
<tSparx|Hw> OneTrickPony: *whistles*
<LightTrooper105> OneTrickPony very disney..
<OneTrickPony> ^
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> ^^
<DeadpoolDash> I wonder which mods are actually watching chat
<LightTrooper105> why?
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: thats something a dictator would do, Im a nice guy and Ill buy what I want
<DoctoDoctorWho> legally
<DeathStar> they are DeadpoolDash they always are
<DoctoDoctorWho> lemme check
<DeadpoolDash> they arent all always watching
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: my lord! have thou awakened?
<LightTrooper105> Im sure some of them are watching
<tSparx|Hw> DeadpoolDash: That's what they want you to think. You probably also believe that they are humans and not AI's. They want you to think that too.
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: of you don't have an air or are not going to step down and have people vote for leader you are a dictator. that is the term for is. the difference is weather you are a benevolent dictator or not
<DoctoDoctorWho> Saturn: are you awake my lord?
<DeadpoolDash> I've seen pictures and AIs would never make themselves look like that
<Crystaline_Shard> Damn all the fanficts I watch updated on the same night XD
<OneTrickPony> imma go to sleep now see ya guys later

<MadSurge> Laurayne: bad link
<Crystaline_Shard> THE SWEETIE CHRONICLES FRAGMENTS UPDATED!
<DeathStar> DeadpoolDash: that's what they want you to think
<tSparx|Hw> DeadpoolDash: They want you to think that too, see? See how this game works? They have you fooled completely.
<LightTrooper105> o.o...
*Crystaline_Shard spazez out
*AJIsAwesome|Busy calms Crystaline_Shard down
<tSparx|Hw> night OneTrickPony :)
<DeadpoolDash> la la la la
<LightTrooper105> OneTrickPony night
<Laurayne> Its Not Bad...
<Laurayne> Goodnight
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Nightm OneTrickPony :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: the term dictator is defined by how one rules, not ones time in office. a dictator has no limits and absolute power, I do have limits to my power and I listen to what the people
<DoctoDoctorWho> want
<Crystaline_Shard> oh gawd pupplysmiles so much D'awwww
<tSparx|Hw> DeathStar: Yeah what he is is a constitutional monarch without a legislative body.
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: what actualy brings up a question. what kind of govern ment will you be running
<DeathStar> tSparx|Hw: ah you're right?
<DeathStar> *minus the ?
<tSparx|Hw> DeathStar: Well, I guess you can't be a *constitutional* monarch without *some* sort of legislative body, but obviously in his government the power balance is basically the opposite of, say, modern UK
<tSparx|Hw> Great Britain*
<DeathStar> tSparx|Hw: understood
<DoctoDoctorWho> the funny thing is that it combines the best traits of the 3 most conflicting ideals, dictatorship, democracy, and communism
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: Communism or socialism?
<MadSurge> Stop HORSEING around guys :D
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: actually they're not all that conflicting,
<Crystaline_Shard> oh gawd a stable Sweetie is screwed :/
<Laurayne> ..... It Wasnt Bad Right...? I Didnt Send A Bad Picture....
<Laurayne> :(
<DoctoDoctorWho> well, I have the strength of a dictatoral ruler, the fairness and benevolence of a democracy, and the authority to controll business like a communist
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: Do you own the means of production and command the entirety of the economy?
<DeadpoolDash> pretty neat http://youtu.be/4Oku3aG839A
<tSparx|Hw> I'd also argue that benevolence isn't really a part of democracy, just a common (but hardly inevitable) product of it
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<tSparx|Hw> Laurayne: I didn't notice it, but I'm sure whatever it was was fine -- otherwise someone would've let you know and/or yelled at ya :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> tSparx|Hw: no, business owned by the people, but if things get out of hand I CAN step in and say no.
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: Then you're a socialist nation, not a communist one.
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: Wait wait, by "the people" or by individual people?
<therainbowvortex> hello every pony
<Moopy> hey dude
<therainbowvortex> hey Moopy sup
<Moopy> hows it going?
<DoctoDoctorWho> tSparx|Hw: never really put much thought into it, how does socialism work? and I mean like pple r free to start and own businesses of their own.
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: Yeah then you're a socialist nation.
<MadSurge> Hey therainbowvortex!
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: I like how you associate fairness and denevolence with democracy when all of the government styles mentiond can be fair as long as they are run correctly
<DoctoDoctorWho> mornin therainbowvortex
<therainbowvortex> good i owe a mate 40$
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, therainbowvortex :)
<LightTrooper105> hello Moopy
<Moopy> hey lighttrooper
<therainbowvortex> AJIsAwesome|Busy: hey can i ask you a qestion
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: I guess, It makes WAAAAY more sense when you are looking at it, I have it all written out
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: it probably dose
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> therainbowvortex: Sure.
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: I think that the easiest way to put it is to define in a communist (Leninist) nation, the people band together to form a Communist Party which overthrows the old government and takes its place, theoretically (though in practice this has never occured) paving the way for a Marxist / socialist society.
<therainbowvortex> i gessing by you name aj your favouite pony right
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> therainbowvortex: Yes.
<therainbowvortex> i was just wondering y
<DoctoDoctorWho> tSparx|Hw: Ill put more reaserch toward it
<Ninjazz> Hey is there a stream up?
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: In communism, the Party owns the means of production and dictates the goods to be produced, usually through 5 or 10 year plans.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Nope
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> No stream
<Ninjazz> Ah. Thank you.
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome|Busy: ya know what I like best about aj?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> No problem.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DoctoDoctorWho: What?
<therainbowvortex> no offense i like her just not as much as say pinkie or dasie
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> THat's okay.
<Ninjazz> Oh. AJ talk?
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome|Busy: that little thing she does with her hooves, ya know when she crosses them? I find it cute as hell
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Not a lot of people like AJ.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DoctoDoctorWho: Definitely. :$
<Ninjazz> Well, no really hates her either.
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: In socialism, there is theoretically no government, and the people own the means of production. Though admittedly socialism was defined by Marx more in terms of what it wasn't (compared to capitalism) than in terms of what it was.
<Moopy> So Therainbowvortex did you get another fluttershy toy yet or what?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> She's just not really an attention grabber like the other 5.
<therainbowvortex> AJIsAwesome|Busy: its just for me she sasent done a lot to stand out pinkies random dashie oh yer what u said
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It's pretty easy why the other 5 ponies get so much love.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> therainbowvortex: I know.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> therainbowvortex: I agree.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It's just that AJ stuck out od the group for me ever since episode one.
<Ninjazz> Well, I personally don't hate or love her. She's just... unremarkable.
<Laurayne> <3 http://mlpchan.net/pony/src/1346641466671.jpg <3
<therainbowvortex> AJIsAwesome|Busy: im just waiting a good epeisod to rely make her stand out awsomly
<Ninjazz> If you don't mind me asking, why do you call her best pony?
<DoctoDoctorWho> tSparx|Hw: the government DOES produce its own goods as a kind of "default competitor", But doesnt use its authority as an unfair advantage.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ninjazz: I can see that. I really can.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ninjazz: Hm? I never said that.
<DeathStar> AJIsAwesome|Busy: people tend not to like aj as much but those who love aj REALLY love AJ,
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ninjazz: I just find her my favorite.
<Ninjazz> AJIsAwesome|Busy, that's my way of saying "your favorite". :^_^;
<DoctoDoctorWho> I dont have a favorite pony
<DeathStar> hi Ninjazz
<Ninjazz> Ohai DeathStar.
<tSparx|Hw> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Word: T-Sparx and Pinkie Pie are my favourite ponies, that doesn't mean I think they're the "best" -- what a nebulous term anyway, haha
<Polydunami> Are we talking about how Applejack is underrated as a character or something?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DeathStar: I don't REALLY love aj. I just find her a REALLY good friend I could've needed in my life.
<Ninjazz> Lol. Almost pinged DeadpoolDash. Like the old days.
<Ninjazz> Ping.
<Polydunami> And now you did :3
<Ninjazz> Ikr. :D
<therainbowvortex> AJIsAwesome|Busy: thats a good point i like aj now
<Polydunami> About Applejack, she certainly stood out from her intro from my point of view.
<DeadpoolDash> pinged where?
<Ninjazz> Well, AJ to me seems more like the fanon's favorite mold.
<Ninjazz> NO WHERE!
<therainbowvortex> Moopy: what do ya think
<Ninjazz> LOOK AWAY!
<MadSurge> Hello Ninjazz! :$
<Ninjazz> Ohai MadSurge. :D
<tSparx|Hw> AJIsAwesome|Busy: Oh, hey, thanks, I'd never thought about that; that's why Pinkie Pie is my favourite. I've always wished I'd been friends with Twilight, but she's my co-favourite because she is /exactly like me/.
<Moopy> think about what?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> THe main reason why I find AJ to be my favorite is that she's the most OPENLY caring and supportive out of all the mane six. Sure she can seem bland at most times, but the fact that she is so supportive of her friends puts her at the top.
*Laurayne Sonic Rainboom!
<Laurayne> :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> I do however, have a soft spot for vinyl scratch
<DeadpoolDash> I'm on to your trixy tricks
<tSparx|Hw> I've always wondered what the specific reason I love Pinkie is so much -- beyond just her awesome personality, I mean :3
<Ninjazz> Since AJ doesn't have a specific character and personality other than being hard working and honest, she seems like the easiest to write as a main protagonist.
<DeathStar> Ninjazz: that's true she can be interperated in many different ways because she is a very plain charicter (not saying that's a negitive)
<DoctoDoctorWho> tSparx|Hw: the fact that she can bend physics?
<Ninjazz> DeathStar, exactly!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I can see that as well.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz~ http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/504ab51f2e274021cf708740e172d00e.png
<Polydunami> Down to earth?
<DeathStar> Ninjazz: though she can be interperated as having bad intentions as well
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Polydunami: That too.
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: No no, AJIsAwesome|Busy just made me realize: it's because I wish I could've been friends with Pinkie, I wish I could be friends with her right now
<therainbowvortex> for me pinkie / fluttershy /dashie is my fave mane 6 derpy fave backround luna favoite princes swetie bell my fave cmc
<Ninjazz> Polydunami, far more than most.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> SHe's also the most down to eath pony in terms of the mane 6.
*Laurayne Cuddles Her Rainbow Dash Picture
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, IT'S LOADING SLOWLY BUT I'M ALREADY LOVING IT SO MUCH.
<MadSurge> :D
<Ninjazz> OOOOHHHH MAAAIII GOOOOOOD I LOVE THIS.
<Polydunami> Took a few seconds for me to recognise the boy as Spike, MadSurge :D
<Ninjazz> ^
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> My life would've been SO MUCH EASIER if I had AJ as a friend IRL.
<DeathStar> AJIsAwesome|Busy: true, even twilight can be very unreasonable
<DeadpoolDash> found the original without the corner insert http://youtu.be/Twl5UB4ye44
*DoctoDoctorWho kicks ass in a classy manner with his nice suit
<MadSurge> Really? :D I recognizied him immediately :D
<Ninjazz> AJIsAwesome|Busy, I'm sure most of ours if we have /any/ of the mane as friends.
<MadSurge> It's because of the hair, right?
<Ninjazz> Even if it was our least favorite.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ninjazz: Agreed.
<Polydunami> Mostly, yeah. Also, non-purple skin.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: also, http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/026348c24687c01c4b203f6bd151fffa.png
<DoctoDoctorWho> If I could live in equestria I would drop all my plans
<Laurayne> I Love Dashie...~<3
<therainbowvortex> AJIsAwesome|Busy: i had this dreem where i was sad and pinkie huged me now I WANT A PINKIE HUG
<MadSurge> She looks a little more G1 in that
<tSparx|Hw> DeathStar: SHE JUST GETS FLUSTERED/ANXIOUS/OVERWHELMED/ETC
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, SO MUCH LOVE.
<Polydunami> Even though I was always partial to Rarity, I think Twilight Sparkle would be my favourite of the mane six.
<Polydunami> :)
<DoctoDoctorWho> brb, require food
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It wasn't the character development for AJ that sold me. It was her personality that made her my favorite. I don't really judge characters based on their development. Doesn't sound fair to me.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: for your daily fix of Rarity :3
<tSparx|Hw> Ninjazz: I've often said before, Rarity's my least favourite, but I'd still love to be bff's
<Polydunami> I guess Rarity would be tied with Twilight Sparkle...
<Polydunami> IMO
<Ninjazz> Thinking hard on it, I absolutely LOVE Rarity. As many of you know. But if an IRL situation, I'd probably have Pinkie Pie as my best friend.
<therainbowvortex> y cant i see streem wait is there a streem
<JRP2234> dang it i missed NewSuperBronyU|Zzz again
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: another question, how are you going to keep track of what's going on in all the different counties when you're leader? and how will you deal with the growing population and shrinking resorses?
<DeadpoolDash> Pinkie Pie is best pony
<DeathStar> DeadpoolDash: secconded
<AdamTheDuck> DeadpoolDash, False, Spike is best pony.
<Moopy> Rainbow Dash is the best pony
<Polydunami> If I were in Equestria, Twilight would be my bestest best friend in the whole wide world :)
<Laurayne> I Wonder If Rainbow Dash Would Take Me Flying With Her.......
<Ninjazz> tSparx|Hw, as I said, even if they're least favorite, they'd be nice friends to have.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Everyone knows Crackle is best pony. :P
<therainbowvortex> DeadpoolDash: i agree kinda im a so confused :'(
<Polydunami> Crackle's cousin, you mean?
<DeathStar> Moopy: technicaly she's a pegisus not a pony ^^;
<Polydunami> Semantics :|
<Moopy> well she said shes the iron pony
<therainbowvortex> AJIsAwesome|Busy: so aj yr fave pony what about backround pony
<tSparx|Hw> AdamTheDuck: He happens not to be a pony
<tSparx|Hw> DeathStar: All three tribes are ponies
<Laurayne> Derpy Is Cutest
<Ninjazz> She also cheated.
<Ninjazz> Pinkie Pie is the cutest. :p
<DeathStar> Moopy: yes but that dosen't meen she's a pony made of iron
<tSparx|Hw> DeathStar: Earth Ponies are ponies, Pegasi are ponies, Unicorns are ponies.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> therainbowvortex: Don't have one. They're all to great.
<Moopy> Pffft whatever dude i think shes still the best pony so there you go
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> *too
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, where ON earth did you find the anime Rarity one?! It's absolutely gorgeous!
<DeadpoolDash> think I might either play ME3 multiplayer or GW2
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: that flustered me for a while too, I plan on splitting the world up into country sized blocks called "provinces", then districts, and so forth
<therainbowvortex> Ninjazz: whoo dashie did not cheat
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: search in Bronibooru :3
<Ninjazz> therainbowvortex, okay, played unfair.
<DeathStar> tSparx|Hw: you see that's the only think I disagre with, they may be closely related, especialy to allow cross breading like with the cake twins, but pegasi would need raddicaly different bone structure to be able to fly and I'm sure unicorns would too to be able to chanel magic
<Ninjazz> Or the judges were just plain idiots. -_-
<therainbowvortex> Ninjazz: now that i agree to
<therainbowvortex> but yer it was unfair
<Buytoast> what's all this?
<DeadpoolDash> what is what?
<Ninjazz> therainbowvortex, I mean hanging AJ above the mud pit and they allow it?!
<Buytoast> you people talking about how rainbow horse blatantly cheated and then cheated again when she agreed to play fairly?
<Ninjazz> what what in the what?
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: and then what? will each provence have a sub leader? if not I don't see how that solves any problems
<tSparx|Hw> DeathStar: Brah, did you not watch the Christmas special? Also, when characters say, "Everypony," it's not like only earth ponies look.
<Laurayne> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9opnsHQppc
<Ninjazz> Buytoast, she didn't agree to play fairly, just agreed to play. :p
<Buytoast> that's horrific
<Polydunami> So they would be anthropomorphised?
<Ninjazz> I wish.
<Buytoast> alright, defend the cheating rainbow horse
<tSparx|Hw> DeathStar: Also they are clearly capable of interbreeding, which makes them the same species by definition, whether their bone structure differs between tribes or not.
<Ninjazz> I'm not defending her.
<Ninjazz> I condemn her.
<Buytoast> not like she purposefully broke rules to ensure victory or anything
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I'm fine with them staying ponies, IMO.
<Polydunami> Egad, I thought Fleur was naked for a second there :S
<Polydunami> -_(\ me
<DeathStar> tSparx|Hw: just because they identify themselfes as ponys dosen't meen scientificaly they are the same, and I acually can't remember what happend in the cristmas special >.> I need to rewatch that one
<Ninjazz> :3
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: authority is split up amongst different governers and ministers and so forth, who all eventually answer to me
<Ninjazz> I like they way you said that Polydunami. :3c
<DeathStar> tSparx|Hw: donkeys and zebras can interbread and so can lions and tigers, they are not the same speices
<Laurayne> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt3mo4pVvAw&feature=related ^_^
<Polydunami> Oh, Youtube. Why you give me suggestive... er, suggestions? :|
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: they are the same species, the unicorns and pegasi are simply sub species of a regular pony
<CrimsonPhoenix> Laurayne, dem K-On
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: that may cause trouble if a minister was to become corupt
<therainbowvortex> hey every pony i have school holdays right now
<Polydunami> That just screams generic
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> therainbowvortex: Nice.
<tSparx|Hw> DeathStar: Species = a group of animals that can interbreed, whose children can (inter)breed, etc. etc .; when Donkeys and Zebras mate, their offspring are born sterile.
<Moopy> thats cool
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: Bronibooru has so many great pictures and no smut/creepy comments! Only weird/creepy pics :D
<Laurayne> Crimsonphoenix: Dunno
<Polydunami> I mean, they're pretty much human. And this is My Little Pony.
<Polydunami> Ponies.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, that almost takes out half the fun. :D
<therainbowvortex> AJIsAwesome|Busy: it also meens i have been come on to brony state for a hole school trume
<CrimsonPhoenix> Laurayne, Personally I must say that video felt pretty lazy
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: thats okay, the Officio Assasinorum will "silence" him and he will be replaced soon enough.
<DeathStar> tSparx|Hw: hmm i was working under a different understanding of speceis
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: but the comments are there for the creepy stuff :D and they're glorious
<Laurayne> Maybe, But Its Still Good Im My Opinion...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Mmmmh I wonder what I should get this morning
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, huzzah!
<DeathStar> DoctoDoctorWho: I would question further but it's sleep time for me, lets continue this at a later date
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh I know
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/7761a93b0b0edb87e303f155c79c9506.png so smug
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> NIght, DeathStar :)
<therainbowvortex> hey i have a party to get to so i gota go
<DeathStar> good night every pony ^_^
<CrimsonPhoenix> I should get some FUCKING CRACKLING OAT BRAN http://youtu.be/pwud6Qh4e_c
<MadSurge> therainbowvortex: have fun! :$
<Polydunami> So they tell us; if My Little Pony was an Anime, it would have humans instead of ponies. And that's kind of generic, isn't it?
<DoctoDoctorWho> DeathStar: indeed, may the lunar princess protect you
<MadSurge> Bye DeathStar!
<Laurayne> Goodnight
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Polydunami: Agreed.
<tSparx|Hw> Vale DeathStar :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Polydunami: It's the pony concept that garners attention.
<Ninjazz> Nacht DeadpoolDash.
<DeathStar> Polydunami: I find that idea a bit silly, there are animes with animals as the main charicters, like hamtaro <3
<Ninjazz> DeathStar.
<Ninjazz> LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
<Crystaline_Shard> Heh I love Sweetie Chronicles fragments
<Laurayne> Is It Weird That Im A Girl And Have A Huge Sickeningly Massive Crush On Rainbow Dash...?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im actually not for the NLR anyway, I just like luna
<Polydunami> Well, that's true, DeathStar
<Crystaline_Shard> Good story glad hes updating it again.
<DeadpoolDash> night
<CrimsonPhoenix> Laurayne, Rainbow Dash is a tomboy
<DoctoDoctorWho> Laurayne: not at all...
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's a bit normal
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: Like a Girl-Crush?
<Crystaline_Shard> anyway Hi agai neverypony taking a short break from reading.
<DeathStar> Laurayne: no but that would cause people to question your sexuality
<Polydunami> But what I find peculiar is that it's My Little Pony... and the characters are HUMANS.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Hi, CrimsonPhoenix :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Wait
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I meant Crystaline_Shard
<Laurayne> As They Should DeathStar
<Polydunami> Okay, that oat bran commercial got way too annoying for my tastes :S
<tSparx|Hw> Laurayne: Well, I for one don't think that being bisexual or a lesbian (etc.) is weird, for one thing, and then secondly I don't think it's weird for a straight woman to have her exceptions or whatever.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I don't get it but I love her expression!
*DeathStar dances off to bed
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: neither do I to be honest
<Polydunami> Good night, DeathStar
<Crystaline_Shard> Night deathstar
<taoumi> nighty everypony
<Polydunami> Good night, taoumi
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> night taoumi :0
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> :)
<Ninjazz> Nacht taoumi.
<tSparx|Hw> Vale, Taumi, bonam noctem.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: http://bronibooru.mlponies.com/post/index?tags=rarity Go wild :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> For the Solar Empire!
<Crystaline_Shard> DoctoDoctorWho: LUAR REPUBLIC
*Ninjazz waves the United Equestrian banner.
<Crystaline_Shard> Lunar*
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: Great And Bountiful Human Empire* (cough cough)
<DoctoDoctorWho> Crystaline_Shard: HERETIC!
<Ninjazz> MadSurge. :O
<Ninjazz> I will save this page. :I
<DeadpoolDash> can has shirt please http://www.welovefine.com/3518-troll-harder.html
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: and make a little altar around it :D
<Polydunami> Oh, Celestia
<Polydunami> Why are you so awesome
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im fine with a double rule, Im just saiyan that if war broke out between the 2, I'd side with the celestia
<tSparx|Hw> For the Protectorate of Equestria!
<spitfirecolt1> hay everypony i was wondering if the new comic book comes with the varient covers or is that seperate
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, oh come on. I already got like 500 pictures on my computer alone. I don't to make an alter for it. :D
<Laurayne> So... I Was Trying To Be Subtle Because Its Kindof Embarassing To Just Say... But Im A Lesbian... I Hope No One Minds...
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: :D
<Polydunami> I'm wondering what this "comic book" deal is in the first place.
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: I'm cool with all these Luna fans, and I can't wait for her to regain her status as co-ruler (if/whenever it happens), but war is more likely to break out between the three tribes than for Princess Luna to gain a sizeable following in the mane 6's lifetime, and the three tribes going to war is almost impossible to think about.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: That's okay. You're among friends. :)
<tSparx|Hw> Laurayne: You're on a brony website. "Love and tolerance," remember? If anyone mind, I will punch them in the face.
<tSparx|Hw> And of course no one minds :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: Gay, Bi, Lesbian, we accept them all. :)
<Laurayne> Thank You All...
<Polydunami> You're among friends at Bronystate, Laurayne :3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: You have NOTHING to worry about. :)
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> We all love you, Laurayne :)
*tSparx|Hw is openly (but not obnoxiously) bi
<Laurayne> Your Going To Make Me Cry...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: Sorry. :$
<DoctoDoctorWho> tSparx|Hw: Impossible, pegasi, earth ponies, and unicorns are far too integrated into eachothers society to turn on eachother, luna is the only liability for an uprising
<Moopy> Well everypony im off to bed Moopy needs his rest talk to yall in the morning aight...............peace
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Night, Moopy :)
<Polydunami> See you, Moopy
<Laurayne> Goodnight
<Moopy> aight late
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It's very nice to meet someone like you, Laurayne. Glad to have you here. :)
<MadSurge> Laurayne: it's not like I already know a few gay/lesbian people :3 welcome
<DoctoDoctorWho> Holy crap, its like im the only straight person in the room
<tSparx|Hw> DoctoDoctorWho: But I'm saying that while it's really likely to see Luna come back to rule, there's no way that she's then going to be able to stake enough legitimacy and/or popularity to rise up against Celestia -- even though the people of Equestria are accepting of Luna, she *was* just Nighmare Moon, no one wants to help NMM lead a rebellion, they lived in fear of her for centuries.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Yeah, Saturn has a boyfriend and we don't mind. :)
<Polydunami> Nope, DoctoDoctorWho.
<Laurayne> Anyway, I Just Thought Id Let You All Know Before My Obvious Attraction To Same-Gender Relationships Makes Anyone Feel Weird....
<Ninjazz> DoctoDoctorWho, erm. False. Hai.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DoctoDoctorWho: I'm not.
<MadSurge> And now, for something I like! http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/292302d97396ad2269237a1272c24268.jpg :D <3
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> DoctoDoctorWho: I am. WHoops.
<Ninjazz> And honestly, I think you'll find most people here are very open minded to those sort of things.
<tSparx|Hw> Laurayne: If it makes anyone feel weird, they should get over themselves, haha
<doughnutjoe> HEY THERE YOU SEXY BRONYS!!!! :D
<Crystaline_Shard> Pfft Join my club Laurayne I'm making jackets.
<Ninjazz> Granted, you'll be able to tell when they arn't.
<Polydunami> Oh hey, doughnutjoe
<doughnutjoe> IM BAACK
<MadSurge> Ohai doughnutjoe!
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I prefer women, but if you prefer other genders I honestly don't mind. :)
<doughnutjoe> o hai everyone
<Laurayne> Ow My Eyes... :(
<DoctoDoctorWho> not that I hate homosexuals and their ilk, It just seems like half the pple here are gay/bi/lezz
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: What's wrong?
<Panda|Sleepies> So...
*Crystaline_Shard Hugs Laurayne ^_^ Fillyfoolers united.
<Panda|Sleepies> I wake up to get a glass of water

<Whistler> BTW MOVIE NIGHT IS TODAY!!!

<Ninjazz> MadSurge, our history... seems so dirty.

<Crystaline_Shard> Whistler: I am streaming right now enjoy my black screen with magic circle.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: but also endearing, in a weird way :D
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Laurayne: I know that feeling. :D

<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I'm not busy anymore.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Why do I find this video so entertaining? http://youtu.be/pwud6Qh4e_c
<Whistler> ONLY FRIDAY NIGHT!
<doughnutjoe> I met a brony at shool today!
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I still am. 6_9
<Polydunami> Yeah, My Little Pony is not the first thing I got into that was first popularised by 4chan
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> doughnutjoe: NICE!
<doughnutjoe> AjIsAwsome and then i found more and more...
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> CrimsonPhoenix: Randomness is fun sometimes.
<Whistler> I meta pegasister at my school today :D
<DoctoDoctorWho> doughnutjoe: how did you 2 find out?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Whistler: Very nice.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: not me, I always liked cartoons :D and Powepuff Girls and Foster's Home were great :)
<Whistler> Wait... that was yesterday...
<Ninjazz> CrimsonPhoenixm silly.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> It's important to allow a little simplicity into your life.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Polydunami, Wakfu?
<Polydunami> Katawa Shoujo, actually
<Ninjazz> ^
<doughnutjoe> Well anyways my new brony friend said hell make me some AJ stickers!!!
<Polydunami> I STILL haven't gotten past Lilly's route :S
<Ninjazz> I'm still on Emi's. -_-
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> doughnutjoe: Very nice. :O
<MadSurge> Still have to try Katawa Shoujo
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I know. I was just joking. I know very well why I like the show.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Polydunami, who's your "waifu"
<Polydunami> Waifu?
<AdamTheDuck> Mai waifu
<Polydunami> Is that some kind of martial arts?
*DoctoDoctorWho should really get back to working on his fanfic
<Polydunami> :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's a popular term in 4chan, especially in /a/
<doughnutjoe> AJIsAwsome except i have no where to stick them lol
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> doughnutjoe: Oh. :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> it means your virtual wife
<Polydunami> Oh, really?
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: when did you realize "Rarity is fabulous and best pony"? :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> as in so love with a character you want her to be yours
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, after Art of the Dress. After I heard her singing voice, i fell in love.
<Ninjazz> But mind, I wasn't a brony yet.
<DoctoDoctorWho> If I was my OC I would pull a tony stark and ship with everypony
<Ninjazz> Just appreciation for a character's voice.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: aaaah, makes lots of sense :$
<Polydunami> So this would be the character I wish were real and with me?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> I seriously wish I became a brony around the origin of Bronystate. Would've loved to see Vivi stream.
<Ninjazz> Polydunami, basically.
<DoctoDoctorWho> and I dont have any problems with that
<MadSurge> Polydunami: the waifu, yes
<doughnutjoe> hmmm strange
<doughnutjoe> my browser crashed
<Polydunami> Yeah, I knew what a waifu was the whole time :D
<Ninjazz> I don't like the term waifu.
<Ninjazz> Polydunami, O U.
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ninjazz: The definition?
<doughnutjoe> oh gawd 4CHAN is leaking
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Or the spelling?
<Polydunami> Pretty much, AJIsAwesome|Busy
<Ninjazz> AJIsAwesome|Busy, the apparent requirments that come with it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Polydunami, yeah, so who's your waifu?
<Crystaline_Shard> pony tit's Pen stroke has a new story too!
<Ninjazz> Like she's your literal wife.
<Spectrum_Rush> Polydunami: how could you lie :O, you must be punished http://i.imgur.com/HBgZD.png
<Ninjazz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V8fKBX3cvs
<tSparx|Hw> Ninjazz: That's not a requirement -- that's just what the word *means*
<Ninjazz> Have some electro swing, chat.
<Polydunami> Well, I really wouldn't consider myself to be overly obsessed with any particular character...
<Ninjazz> tSparx|Hw, no. I've actually seen a bit of the apparent Waifu guide.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well ok then
<Ninjazz> And I only summerized.
<doughnutjoe> Theres a waifu guide?
<AJIsAwesome|Busy> Ninjazz: Thank you.
<tSparx|Hw> Ninjazz: "Waifu guide"?
<Ninjazz> tSparx|Hw, eyup.
<DoctoDoctorWho> I would just pull a tony stark and ship with EVERYPONY!
<Ninjazz> AJIsAwesome|Busy, a pleasure.
<tSparx|Hw> Ninjazz: I will admit to not really being in the communities that regularly use this word, but I didn't realize it originated from someplace.
<DoctoDoctorWho> bye everypony
<doughnutjoe> so i met another brony today
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, DoctoDoctorWho :)
<Ninjazz> Cya DoctoDoctorWho.
<DoctoDoctorWho> fic's wont write themselves
<doughnutjoe> and he showed me some pictures on his phone
<doughnutjoe> sure enough
<doughnutjoe> ship pics
<doughnutjoe> i left
<Ninjazz> tSparx|Hw, to be fair, most can just say "mah waifu" and you'll know what they mean. BUT since I've seen the more hardcore base, I'd rather not confuse myself with them.
<Polydunami> How would you confuse yourself with other people, Ninjazz? :S
<Polydunami> :3
<Ninjazz> Polydunami, I are not grammar sensei.
<Ninjazz> AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. D:<
<doughnutjoe> whoa there
<Polydunami> Well, nobody's perfect!
<doughnutjoe> calm down saipan boy
<Polydunami> I need to see that movie
