<Kammerjunk> Nittany_Discord: I wasn't in the Mane 6 rooms at this point. I was spared the flood.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Aww :<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Every room flooded.
<Kammerjunk> Nittany_Discord: Not regulars.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think I was in RD when that happened.
<alexxm> one of my favorite PMVs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or main.
<TheKoreanBrony1354> sounds alot diffrent from oringinal
<Ponies47> I wasen't a brony when this episode came out. I became a brony the weekend "A Friend in Deed" aired. But my first epiosde was Lesson Zero :P
<pony_3803> hmm can you use your mic on these chat rooms
<Chrysalis> Kammerjunk mention this room in mane no more
<twi_sprinkler_GS17> MadSurge: btw im actually playing skyrim right now. and apparently i cant pickpocket children lol
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Nope
<Silverscreen> 1,11...that voice....is that RD?
<SploogeTheFish> If we could that would be cool
<Pale_Horse> Something that always made me wonder.... The Elements of Harmony are repesented by a Rainbow right?... And a Rainbow has seven colors... But there are only 6 listed elements... :|
<OohShiny> A Friend in Deed is indeed an awesome episode
<Kammerjunk> Silly filly, I just said regulars. Nopony joined, eh?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> we should watch some Arby n the Chief :3
<Ponies47> pony_3803: Nope.avi
<mitamaking> I was already watching ponies when that episode aired, but I hadn't caught up
<Kammerjunk> Nittany_Discord: Was #bronystate open at that episode? I thought that was after the main room was closed on live airings.
<Braviary> John Madden.
<pony_3803> k
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's Fall-Out Boy except they changed the pitch.
<beevarkian> Silverscreen: its modulated to sound like it
<Tokomo_sparkle> Not ReAl!
<Meanwhile> Half and half on this point.

<cowvarkian> >.>
<MadSurge> twi_sprinkler_GS17: Bethesda's children are invincible, don't you know?
<Silverscreen> 1,11oh.
<cowvarkian> there we go
<Silverscreen> 1,11Well, they did a good job.
<OohShiny> ICARUS
<Pale_Horse> Not with the right mods they're not!
<mitamaking> Rarity killed the Wonderbolts
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Might have done it to prevent copyright claiming.
<OohShiny> poor Spitfire
<cowvarkian> seems legit, Nittany_Discord
<alexxm> the wonderbolts never do anything
<Tokomo_sparkle> dat purfact mur Dr
<twi_sprinkler_GS17> MadSurge: Oo interesting. i also remember in WoW kids dont have a death animation. for the best i guess
<MadSurge> Silverscreen: it's the Offspring, not Fallout Boy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Kammerjunk: I don't remember when we started closing main during pony eps.
<Kammerjunk> Fair 'nuff.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Offspring. Whatever.
<pony_3803> hmmm
<SploogeTheFish> Fallout boy...I can only think of vault boy
<mitamaking> Rainbow should have been put into the Wonderbolts then
<Chrysalis> a) this is a style of music known as NightCore
<Pale_Horse> Ugh. i got to run to the pharmacy...
<OohShiny> Rainbow is just too awesome to be in the Wonderbolts
<Chrysalis> also, its Offspring - your gonna go far kid
<Tokomo_sparkle> dat tripzy
<kirzstryfe> 8,6mane started to get muted during the episodes about 2/3 of the way through s2
<Kammerjunk> Ah.
<SploogeTheFish> So much dubstep of this scene
<GarrettBrony> kirzstryfe why
<SploogeTheFish> its wonderful
<FlaschenJoe11> Regulars seems like a exclusive club
<RaveBrony> kirzstryfe: Mhhm

<xxMoopyxx> So was that all you guys reacted to derpy whooves and when she spkoed
<mitamaking> Man, how busy is this site going to be on Season 3 episode 1
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I smiled.
<SploogeTheFish> oh shit
<Kammerjunk> I suppose it's what the name says. For regulars.
<Ponies47> mitamaking: It's gonna be crazy
<cowvarkian> so busy it wont be up? mitamaking
<alexxm> mitamaking its going to be crazy
<Meanwhile> Probably because it kinda is.
<FairysHuff> mitamaking I expect the internet will break.
<OohShiny> well, when I saw derpy talking, I was not used to background ponies yet
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: pretty much :D
<kirzstryfe> 8,6because it's a bit difficult to moderate 4k people in a single channel
<SploogeTheFish> mitamaking: its gonna be worse than a DDoS
<OohShiny> so I did nothing
<xmasskills> hey mario_pony
<mitamaking> I mean I couldn't even pull up the video during the season 2 finale, I had to jump to BronyTV
<Ponies47> And that's how all the side chatrooms we're born ^^
<Kammerjunk> Also, INB4 main chat flood when BMN starts.
<GarrettBrony> kirzstryfe I know. during the season 2 finale. no pony could even be heard with all the people in it
<cowvarkian> didnt we have like, 6K people on here once, or was I just imagining that >.>
<mario_pony> Hi xmasskills
<Kammerjunk> cowvarkian: Probably not.
<cowvarkian> ok

<MadSurge> mitamaking: I just went to the Spike channel (no chat)
<Meanwhile> Ikr.
<xmasskills> mario_pony: im on it now message me im arsenicSwordsman

<alexxm> hey TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Why do they have to take it out?
<Eddmario> SploogeTheFish: You can pick up to 2 traits at the beginning of the game, you can mod certain weapons, and you get a perk every other level instead of every level, and certain outfits cause certain people to attack you on site
<turtlegod98> how do you makes videos like this?
<rabidsonic> good afternoon thegreatandpowerfult
<Waffles> sUp TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<sergio_scriptor> my favorite type of music is music from the medieval ages and from the 20's till the 80's :)

<Kammerjunk> I don't think FO3 was better than NV, but neither do I think NV was the better. I think they're both great, NV is simply slightly different.

<Spell-of-Gaming> Shrek?
<RobertRevenge> Eddmario: The space core does nothing but waste space in your inventory
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh no.
<SploogeTheFish> Fallout: Online sounds like somethnig you wont see.
<SploogeTheFish> If you do
<SploogeTheFish> Its gonna be a pay to play
<RaveBrony> Nittany_Discord: Oh shit >.<
<Kammerjunk> SploogeTheFish: Well, there was that thing they won the rights to do.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does the stream seem laggy for anyone else?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I had a Shrek toy which LITERALLY spilled slime. :I
<Eddmario> RobertRevenge: Actually, it can be used to make a somewhat unique helmet
<BlazeAngel> Nittany_Discord: I dont know, I look at it in the mirror, and with the fact that it was a sting, we had to get the stinger out, and my eye is just... messed.

<SploogeTheFish> Eddmario: You know Metal Arms?
<Eddmario> SploogeTheFish: Know it? I still own a copy of it!
<SploogeTheFish> Eddmario: Same here
<sergio_scriptor> SploogeTheFish: nope,it was beacuse the original the people working on the fallout online wore also the makers of the original fallouts,but bethesda bought the rights and bye bye fallout online,they decide to scrap the project :'(
<Eddmario> Now, I don't know where it went and I don't even think it works completly...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I miss Megaman
<sergio_scriptor> SpadeMagnes[R]: who doesn't ?
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Why do you want a fallout online? Cant you play like , the new Mmos that is coming out? Perfect world or what its called
<SploogeTheFish> Eddmario: The creators of the game, I think they went bankrupt due to their Underrated game, Metal Arms
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I really wanted Rockman Online
<Eddmario> Meh, the only Megaman games I've played are Battle Network 3 and an emulation of Battle Network 4.

<xxMoopyxx> i didn't know that
<Meanwhile> BlazeAngel: Woah wait, what's going on?

<sergio_scriptor> MaxTheSwedishBrony: beacuse fallout is unique in it's own way,it's something compeletly diferent from other apocalipict games,the atmossphere is unique,and i would love to see all of that in a multyplkayer experience :'(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> MIPS
<RaveBrony> BlazeAngel: Holy shit.... im sorry >.<

<GarrettBrony> Meanwhile at the Hall of Justice, Aquaman is just making a sandwich because he cant do shit
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You have to take medicine to keep your body from killing the foriegn organ
<RobertRevenge> sergio_scriptor: Fallout 3 and NV suck, if you've ever played Fallout 1 and 2. Bethesda scrapped the original story completely.
<BronyInstrumental> Nittany_Discord: ever heard of a glass eye?......

<Eddmario> Nittany_Discord, BlazeAngel: If they can replace corneas, they can replace the full eye
<Meanwhile> As for eye surgery, that's all very case-to-case. Eyes are delicate, there's no straight answer until they work out the kinks in that optic camera.
<Kammerjunk> I love Charlie Chaplin.-
<DIZZYRATCHET> medic
<sergio_scriptor> RobertRevenge: the others fallout games wore a diferent experience,and to be honest i prefer the bethesda fallout,even the story and experience i think it's better,they defenatly improved the old games in A LOT

<SpadeMagnes[R]> And why does this speech make so much sense?

<Meanwhile> Harsh. What kind of assignments?
<IshFrustratedPony> Math 190
<BlazeAngel> Why are Aj's freckles... white? O.o

<RobertRevenge> What's that SpadeMagnes[R]
*StuffCrusader hssn't played banjo kazzoie
<Kammerjunk> I remember playing Crash Bandicoot on the PS1 (That wasn't mine either). It was the one with the island and the tribal mask and the ooga booga. Don't remember what it's called.
<Eddmario> RaveBrony: Any of the first 4 Pokemon movies, or the Digimon movie
<SpadeMagnes[R]> How the hell does Gruntilda have grade A plutonium in Clanker's cavern?
<RaveBrony> BlazeAngel: Ill look it up :)
<kirzstryfe> 8,6then I'd suggest getting off the irc and focusing :p
<Tovler> Despicable Me was the last kids movie I can think of where I learned the words to the songs. I haven't done that since Disney.
<sergio_scriptor> SploogeTheFish: Scoot-Scootaloo never plays games...EVER :'(

<sergio_scriptor> everytime i ear this song i always remeber of "The Master" /)_*
<kirzstryfe> 8,6a partial would be better than a complete fail
<Kammerjunk> RaveBrony: No, B isn't necessarily bad.

<Dken2021> *video
<OohShiny> deal with it
<RaveBrony> Kammerjunk: Yeah, but its apparently not what its supposed to be :o Now it has to be a "B" movie :o
<Tovler> Young Frankenstein had an 8/10 on imdb. I shouldn't have been B, imoo.
<Eddmario> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2128/
<DIZZYRATCHET> deal with it
<RobertRevenge> I love the random Ask Princess Molestia pics
<Saigneur> plot
<RaveBrony> Kammerjunk: *what it used to be
<kirzstryfe> 8,6B movies include cult flicks, and bad enough to be funny, not necessarily bad for the point of being bad
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> xD
<Quick_Thinker> i know but they cant see the video so they think its a song and im getting the wrong ppeople talking
<DIZZYRATCHET> dance
<SpeedyBolt> AAAAAAAAAAA
<RaveBrony> Eddmario: Oh god o_o
<Eddmario> Ask Princess Molestia and Gamer Luna is hilarious
<Meanwhile> Dat video.
<sergio_scriptor> alexxm: a little video called " 10th doctor: the musical" uses this song when the master makes his second apperance so,now i always see the master when i ear this song :|
<DIZZYRATCHET> aaaaaa
<cowvarkian> like babes in toyland? kirzstryfe
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Eddmario: O.o
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Young Frankenstein is a B because it's a cult flick
<Kencolt> kirzstryfe: You forgot any film by Ed Wood.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6babes got WMC'd, so that's the answer there :p
<alexxm> sergio_scriptor ok then
<Dken2021> Quick_Thinker i'm sure they can recognize eminen
<RaveBrony> kirzstryfe: But i dont know any :( it would be nice to fully fill out the survey for once :D
<Tovler> Young Frankenstein is not a cult flick
<IshFrustratedPony> kirzstryfe I ave important scholarships that I will lose the support of if I'm not perfect, I can't afford to lose them, which mean I can't afford a partial
<cowvarkian> how about blazing saddles >.>
<StuffCrusader> what's the name of this vid?
<RaveBrony> o_o
<Saigneur> mic the microphone ?
<Kencolt> kirzstryfe: Mel Brooks considers Young Frankenstien his best work.
<RobertRevenge> cowvarkian: That's another good movie that's considered "B"
<Quick_Thinker> i know they can but im trying to find bronys in BO maybe even get a brohoof from oone so this song really fucks up all my efforts
<kirzstryfe> 8,6pick any Sci-Fi original movie, always a safe choice for a B
<Tovler> Blazing Saddles was an A movie here
<sergio_scriptor> cowvarkian: for b movie ? sure
<SpeedyBolt> That was...the weirdest video
<DIZZYRATCHET> lol suck
<Eddmario> cowvarkian: I don't think it's been long enough. Probably same with Spaceballs

<MaxTheSwedishBrony> Its going F2P soon :D
<Dken2021> and for some reason, mips is really laggy on my end, stupid ISP
<Kammerjunk> sergio_scriptor: That's pretty much how most MMOs work, yeah.
<MASF123> I'm just upset it won't have online play or the ability to swap between Mickey or Oswald.
<kirzstryfe> 8,6TOR crashed hard after what, 3 months?

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ah yeah the anthology :D
<OohShiny> dat music is awesome anyway
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Why does bowser never give up?
<Kammerjunk> twi_sprinkler_GS17: Basically, it means shooting lighting out of your crotch every time you level up makes you feel good. Bit more nuanced, but then I would have to go into detail, and that takes too long for my attention span.
<Dken2021> Scoot-Scootaloo the first of the sequel?
<rabidsonic> i suck at gaming so i suck at getting star coins
<MaxTheSwedishBrony> So awesome Picture/video
<Eddmario> Scoot-Scootaloo: Play BOTH Anthologies back-to-back. Screw the Friday Movie Night

<Eddmario> MASF123: The first is about half an hour. The sequal is about an hour and a half
<Kencolt> Heck-- Anthology II is practially a movie in itself-- it's certainly longer than a few shown here!
<DIZZYRATCHET> how long is 9000 seconds
<SpadeMagnes[R]> New Super Mario Brothers is the only game where bowser actually dies
<OohShiny> this one is Anthology II

It is the largest Russian intelligence agency, six times
