<SomeRandomPony> o mit umlaut
<Petrified_Discord> Alchemist: Seems legit
<Jim> Schrödinger's pony is dead and/or alive
<Petrified_Discord> Schrödinger's pony is alive, dead, alive and dead, and neither all at the same time
<SomeRandomPony> It's neither dead nor alive
<Lil_B> Alchemist slap them in the Face... with Chemistry...
<Alchemist> But it turns out there are two lists of the prerequisite table and the two are different and they say I looked at the "wrong" one.
<Petrified_Discord> Funfact: Schrödinger used his "cat" example to disprove quantum mechanics
<Cobellanez> Laptop overheated. AGAIN.
<SomeRandomPony> Hooray for powering through three hours of sleeps and meds
<SomeRandomPony> Cobel is it an HP?
<WindWhistler> You guys aren't taking this very seriously...
<Cobellanez> Dell
<Cobellanez> Laptop
<SomeRandomPony> Ahh, just as bad
<Cobellanez> Heres a thought
<Alchemist> So they screwed up and they want to blame it on me.
<Cobellanez> Make a laptop ABLE TO BE USED ON YOUR LAP
<Ray> 02Excuse me angel
*Lil_B rustles the Chat's Jimmies
<Aurora> 6EXCUUUUUSE ME PRINCESS
<Petrified_Discord> Cobellanez: Waaaaaaaaaaat?

<Cobellanez> What?
<Ray> 02Even tho it's not a battle song
<WindWhistler> It's a program that lets you make another computer
<Ray> 02It would fit good enough for one
<WindWhistler> But you have to have the setup disk for whatever series you're using.
<Lil_B> inb4 Inception reference
<Petrified_Discord> Computers making computers? I don't like where this is heading...
<Cobellanez> Its just that my laptop overheats when I play games whiles its on my lap
<WindWhistler> Oh no, it's perfectly safe
*Ray rests his case
<WindWhistler> You set up how much memory you want it to have.
<SomeRandomPony> Gaming laptop is an oxymoron
<Cobellanez> I've now got an icepack on my crotch
<Petrified_Discord> Yeah. Taking AI classes makes you realize just how unlikely a robot uprising is. Sigh... :(
<SomeRandomPony> Lol
<WindWhistler> But that takes up actually memory from your computer
<Aurora> 6is this about to be a fight theme battle?
<WindWhistler> It's useful for playing outdated games
<FillyFlam> I was wondering why everyone was so quiet.
<GilDash> Well, that's another crap day outta the way. =_=
<Jim> IT must be tuesday
<alexxm> what happened GilDash
<Echo> Alot of people I hear are using virtual machines as cloud servers because if they crash it's like MEH
<WindWhistler> Unfortunately...I don't think you can get internet
<GilDash> alexxm: Not much... Just still tired from yeserday basically.
<Lil_B> hello there GilDash :3
<WindWhistler> Which leaves me stuck because I have to register the computer in order to actually do anything on it
<Petrified_Discord> "Well I've got email and Google...now I just need to download the rest of the internet." O_O
<Elondras> Hey GilDash

<Ray> 02Mfw: http://puu.sh/dP3j and http://puu.sh/dP4p
<killerpony7733> GilDash i got a too good immune system i hardly get sick and when i do it knocks me out bad else i will be sick free almost a whole year
<FillyFlam> I could tell you why, but it would be violating my own ban on politics.
<SomeRandomPony> Hooray for autoimmune issues \o/
<Petrified_Discord> My white blood cells, they are made of STEEL! :[
<DuskStarshimmer> FillyFlam, Can I share your polotics ban?
<cow334> So no one is streaming at the moment?
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I've had flu twice that I've literally just shrugged off like it was nothing. :D
<Diablo> who will talk to me?
<FillyFlam> DuskStarshimmer: Please do, lol. Internet political discussion tend to end...badly.
<Alchemist> I was laways sick when I lived with my parents. then I moved in to an apartment and I got heqalthier :D
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL really tiny pictures that have larger versions on imgur
<killerpony7733> GilDash i kinda feel like a extremely immune system is both a gift and a curse :D
<Shimmer> Alchemist: Quite normal, that
<GilDash> I am convinced my room is bad for me. I always wake up with a blocked nose. :S
<killerpony7733> extremely good*
<Diablo> halo???
<Petrified_Discord> Alchemist: lolyeah. I remember on my very first break from college my parents got me sick :D
<Sylandest> GilDash: sorry for late reply, got pulled away. You need to definitely get some fluids in you and some medicine or something
<Ray> 02I know, but I like to resize them for storage problems.
<Ray> 02not enough space, lol
<GilDash> killerpony7733: I manage to pick up colds like no one's business, but they never really affect me, so... I guess I'd rather have the crap colds really. :D
<drfsupercenter> 03the internet has practially unlimited space :P
<Sylandest> GilDash: i hate colds...i have a rough enough time with allergies
<GilDash> Sylandest: Please, it'll be a runny nose again. I can handle a cold or two. ;)
<GilDash> Sylandest: I once had 3 colds in a month. *That* was fun. :D
<Sylandest> GilDash: Fair enough, hehehe. I just dislike seeing a friend ill :$
<alexxm> so still no stream then
<Sylandest> GilDash: geez! :O
<devildog> hey everypony
<killerpony7733> GilDash hahaha yeah all i really have had was a few major sicknesses that knocked me out quite badly in total i may have been sick less then 5 times in a whole year
<Elondras> hey devildog
<Aurora> 6technically, making a copy of something uses more space anyways
*AlienEd27 has not been sick since last year
<Angel_Espeon> 13I hate when Photoshop decides to lag >:/
<Aurora> 6or else i completely misunderstood you lot
<drfsupercenter> 03well I think he means he gets rid of the originals
<Alchemist> Petrified_Discord: yeah they are usually over protective and dont let you build up an immune system. I had to save some cash so in the winter the avregae temp was around 10°C in my apartment to save on the bill and I built up a quite strong immune system :D
<drfsupercenter> 03but if it were me, I'd just bookmark them
<alexxm> hey devildog hows your day been
<Sylandest> AlienEd27: you just jinxed yourself, lol
<Sylandest> howdy devildog
<Ray> 02You completly understood. I ->had<- the bigger versions

<Shimmer> Since we're talking about illness now; The last 2 days I've had back pain that reminds me of a muscle knot, only 5 times worse pain, anyone got any idea what it could be?
<Sylandest> AlienEd27: lol, its a joke. You said you haven't been sick all year, so now you're gonna get sick soon :D
*AlienEd27 is terrible at social interactions
*killerpony7733 hates not being sick to avoid work of sorts :D

<drfsupercenter> 03I didn't realize it was her birthday
<drfsupercenter> 03happy birthday LOL
<Soital> 12XD
<GilDash> Sylandest: The only reasons I have to take days off for migraines is because I go BLIND. >_<
<Soital> 12what is this nicks thing o.e
<Sylandest> GilDash: O.O never mind, no days off if thats the consequence for them!
<SomeRandomPony> Migraines are fun

<SomeRandomPony> It was sarcasm
<GilDash> SomeRandomPony: MIGRAINES ARE NOT FUN! :D
<devildog> how do send a message toward a person
<SomeRandomPony> And I get them frequently
<Soital> 12I see so everything has expired or something now? XD
<killerpony7733> GilDash you go blind due to migraines? :D
<Chrysalis> a migraine is sickening and horrible in every way
<Alchemist> Chrysalis: and you are like a vampire. running from any source of light.

<Chrysalis> seriously, for a while i didnt sit down, not cause the sitting down was a problem, but i was scared of the pain from standing up
*GilDash hugs Chrysalis.
<AlienEd27> nopony pays attention to me, well, story of my life :P
<Alchemist> Lil_B: well, nonetheless I dont like taking any sort of medication let alone extra strong ones...
<Sylandest> AlienEd27: my apologies, i missed your message
<Chrysalis> meh, tis alot better recently, as with anything you can learn to manage it
<Lil_B> Alchemist understandable :/
<drfsupercenter> 03Most anticipated episode in this series, hopefully it's good XD
*Petrified_Discord pays attention to AlienEd27 O_O
<Sylandest> AlienEd27: ive never really had visual distortions before, myself
<GilDash> Chrysalis: I never really had them long enough to. Pain is one of the few things that gets to me easily. :S
<GilDash> Sylandest: They're not fun. :(
<SomeRandomPony> Triptans are the main drug used to treat migraines, but most doctors prefer prevenitive drugs
<Sundaysmile> For all you sickies out there http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8_pkvlcRTE
<Sylandest> GilDash: I wouldn't imagine them to be. I'm sorry you all have to deal with so much trouble. makes me feel rather bad, somehow
<Chrysalis> yeah, i havnt gone back to the doctors after i came off my anti-depressants
<GilDash> I was never a priority for migraine cases. I just gave up and took them.
<AlienEd27> Sylandest never had your heart stop, and then start beating again?
<GilDash> Sylandest: Trust me, mine were probably nothing compared to Chrysalis.
<Alchemist> O_O
<Lil_B> I get Migranes when: a) Fast weather changes, b) REALLY Hard work for a Long time (or an heavy sport activity for a long time) or c) when i don't drink enough water
<GilDash> AlienEd27: A couple of times, I think. Probably not good really. :D
<SomeRandomPony> Worst pain I've been in was when I had meningitis
<Chrysalis> Lil_B that sounds more like dehydration than migraines
<Sylandest> AlienEd27: no, I cant say I have. that sounds terrifying
<GilDash> SomeRandomPony: Is that not poisoned blood?
<SomeRandomPony> Gil, wat
<Sundaysmile> Worst pain I ever experienced was taking my ex to a Justin Bieber concert.
<Sundaysmile> 2 hours...
<Ray> 02SOITAL
<Alchemist> :D
<Ray> 02ARE YOU THERE
<Sylandest> GilDash: so it would seem...you know, only for you lot would I somehow feel guilty for feeling good, you know that? :$
<Chrysalis> Sundaysmile wow, i feel for you
<SomeRandomPony> You brought that on yourself
<Chrysalis> i would take all the pain i do if it lets me avoid that
<Sundaysmile> love makes you do stupid things
*alexxm hugs Sundaysmile no one should experiance that
<Chrysalis> Sundaysmile know that feel bro
<pyrocatboy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1ila1dXb8o&feature=BFa&list=PL1B0FCEF532E3DC85
<GilDash> Sylandest: Eh, it's no shakes. I've been extremly lucky in all other areas of health, so I'm grateful really. :)
<AlienEd27> Sylandest it is, got freaked out yesterday since i noticed that my heart wasn't beating, and just when i tried to move it felt like it was going to be ripped appart 6_9
<alexxm> hey pyrocatboy hows your day been
<Lil_B> Chrysalis Well, I think its Migration caused by Dehydration, because the Migrane stays even hours after i drank enough water (mostly until the next day)... drinking to much water can also cause Migrane
<Sylandest> AlienEd27: I take it you have a heart condition then? thats what im understanding here
<Chrysalis> everything in moderation as they say
<Sylandest> GilDash: well, then thats good. We just gotta look out for the few rough patches you have then :)
<RyunosukeKnT> OOOO
<SomeRandomPony> I take atenolol for my heart condition
<GilDash> AlienEd27: Doctor. Now.
<AlienEd27> Sylandest , you really think so? i'm not overweight or anything...
<RyunosukeKnT> new PMV Mini Madness: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17YKUp-0Ip4
<Sylandest> AlienEd27: what Gildash said. Go see the doc. A irregular heart rhythm is no joke, especially if it stos
<Sylandest> *stops
<GilDash> Sylandest: Like I said, I haven't had one in 3 years. As far as I'm concerned, I'm all clear. :)
<Alchemist> Yeah Im greatful I dont have any progressive /genetic/mental illnesses. Having only migraines sounds like a godd deal compared to many many other people.
<AlienEd27> i'm going to die.... fuu.... :'(
<killerpony7733> GilDash ever tried to have you heart skip a few beats?
<Sylandest> GilDash: well, then thats good too. :) I'm glad
<SomeRandomPony> Genetics screwed me over. I have so many hereditary problems.
<GilDash> Alchemist: That's how I look at it.
<AlienEd27> I'm 15! how can i have a heart condition when i am a active 15 year old!? 6_9
<Ray> 02ANYWAYS
<Ray> 02http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/4459088_700b.jpg
<killerpony7733> AlienEd27 yes
<SomeRandomPony> Alien could be genetic
<Sundaysmile> I know a nine year old with a pacemaker, it's not uncommon
<Ray> 02So true
<GilDash> killerpony7733: It's felt as though it has, but I seriously doubt it *actually* had.
<Thorn> AlienEd27: You can still get one.
<SomeRandomPony> I've had one all my life, but didn't discover it till much later
<Aurora> 6LOL
<GilDash> AlienEd27: I once knew a kid who died at 14 from a heart condition. He was the best footballer int he shcool too.
<AlienEd27> yeah... when i think about it, had a cousin with some sort of leak in his heart.
<Aurora> 6thats so fabuloud
<AlienEd27> well, i still have
<Aurora> 6fabulous
<Sundaysmile> Although that's IF it's an irregular heart beat. Sometimes, depending on your position you can't feel your own heartbeat. Best thing to check, is your Pulse instead
<AlienEd27> he's not dead, luckily
<killerpony7733> GilDash i tried it once while waking up in the middle of the night i was slightly awake and i suddenly felt my heart stop and i couldn't move and i near fell into panic but after 2 or 3 seconds it strarted again :D
<GilDash> AlienEd27: I don't want to scare you, but you should go and see a doctor.
<killerpony7733> GilDash i agree
<alexxm> AlienEd27 that might be best
<SomeRandomPony> Panic attacks can make you feel like you're having a heart attack
<Sundaysmile> indeed
<Nick> o-o
<Nick> ouch
<AlienEd27> GilDash , i think it's just because i didn't breathe in a normal pace, my heartrate sinks when i don't breathe fast enough
<Sundaysmile> I still suffer from anxiety attacks too
<SomeRandomPony> I've had enough of those @_@
<Chrysalis> trying to deal with someone whos panicing is really tough
<Chrysalis> logic no longer applies
<GilDash> AlienEd27: Regardless, it shouldn't be skipping beats like that.
<SomeRandomPony> my heart wiring is messed up
<Sundaysmile> indeed Chrysalis, most become hypochondriacs *spelling
<AlienEd27> GilDash aw buck...
<Petrified_Discord> Sundaysmile: You got it right :)
<GilDash> Chrysalis: The best you can do is try to comfort them and give them some space. :S
<Chrysalis> there was a dog attack on my street last week, poor gal had massive puncture wounds on her arm
<Chrysalis> couldnt get a word of sense out of her
<killerpony7733> GilDash i got this condition http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectus_carinatum
<Chrysalis> asked me to put one of the dogs involved in the living room, with a god damn baby in there
<GilDash> Chrysalis: I doubt you could. Dogs used to absoultely *terrify* me when I was young. I never knew any dogs but friendly ones either.
<Alchemist> My sister in law was in a similar situation. she panicked first then went into a shock when we got a coll that my brother had a car accident.
<Chrysalis> yeah, bull mastifs arnt the most friendly of dogs
<NickDinner> bbl
<Chrysalis> Alchemist ouch, was he OK?
<Alchemist> he was fine (though it was a miracle he wasnt hurt)
<Bronysith> im back
<SomeRandomPony> I have scheuermann's which gives me a lovely odd walking motion
<alexxm> hey Bronysith hows your day been
<Alchemist> A drunk driver slammed him against the railings on the highway.
<Lil_B> hi Bronysith
*Bronysith crash glomps into alexxm
<Bronysith> alexxm: good
*alexxm hugs Bronysith bacj
<killerpony7733> GilDash checked the wiki page on that condition i have?
*alexxm hugs Bronysith back
<Chrysalis> Alchemist good to hear he was OK
<AlienEd27> killerpony7733 i did
<Diablo> someon there
<Diablo> ?
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Yeah. Weird. :S
<Chrysalis> killerpony7733 for anything like that, going online to search yourself is generally a bad idea, going to a doctor is a far better idea
<GilDash> I need to have food now. See you guys in a few. ;)
<Alchemist> Chrysalis: yes. and the bastard got a 1 year sentence because he already had his license pulled for a DUI earlier that year :D
<DuskStarshimmer> At the Gala!
<Cat> maybe
<Sylandest> GilDash: we'll be waiting! :)
<killerpony7733> Actually i'm diagnosed with it so i know what it is
<Cat> :O
<Lil_B> Bronysith you joined just as I was browsing threw the ew deviations on my DA Account and I saw a Photo of you XD
<SomeRandomPony> I love the list of problems on the visit summaries from my rheumatologist
<Chrysalis> Alchemist good to hear

<AlienEd27> does anypony else have two haircolors?
<Chrysalis> AlienEd27 i do,
<LoyalDash> AlienEd27: Not me.>_<
<alexxm> i don't
<killerpony7733> GilDash it's funny to have being born with a genetic defect that isn't harmful but instead just gives me two different eye colors :D
<devildog> i wis i did
<Chrysalis> i got brown, fading to red on the end
<AlienEd27> you do Chrysalis ?
<Viri> 14Staraptor :D
<Chrysalis> killerpony7733 thats SO cool to see when people get 2 eye colours
<LoyalDash> Chrysalis: Wow, that sounds like a cool color combination then.
<Staraptor> 2Halloo :3
<Sylandest> AlienEd27: I have brown hair, but my facial hair somehow has red hair...not sure how that happened
<DuskStarshimmer> twilight can be the best pony today :3 <3
<SomeRandomPony> I have two colors in the same eye
<SomeRandomPony> lol
<LoyalDash> DuskStarshimmer: Not to me.:3
<Chrysalis> Yup, when i finally get around to re-dying it im going gonna go for the end
<alexxm> SomeRandomPony how does that work
<drfsupercenter> 03ohai
<Chrysalis> i can change my hair colour by changing how i have my hair, brown when up, red when down
<Sundaysmile> brown hair, blue eyes. Mundane and boring ftw
*DuskStarshimmer glomps LoyalDash, fine *shrug*
<SomeRandomPony> green ring round the pupil and blue ring around that
<Viri> 14how are you?
<LoyalDash> DuskStarshimmer: Dat glomp.:D
<AlienEd27> well, i was talking more of having Blond hair, but on the right side of my head i had a palm sized spot of black hair
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis wanna hear the worst part people don't notice it but when they do. they feel very surprised i also kinda wished i could show you the pattern my eye color is in >_<
<Sylandest> alexxm: heterochromia iridum
<alexxm> thanks Sylandest
<Chimera> Drf
<drfsupercenter> 03?

<Sylandest> alexxm: you're welcome :)
<Chrysalis> killerpony7733 what colours are they?
<MadSurge> Sylandest: Same here :D red facial hair, wtf
<DuskStarshimmer> Ao much onbeat echoes *melts*
<Chimera> She wasn't allowed to have an end of the year event
<LoyalDash> MadSurge: ...wat.:D
<Chimera> But she was like "f*** that"
<Sylandest> MadSurge: Ikr? I checked my heritage and it kinda makes sense, yet it still confuses me
<Chimera> And we got 4 pies anyway LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03heh
<killerpony7733> alexxm i got the same condition as somerandompony
<Sylandest> LoyalDash: me and MadSurge have red facial hair, and we're not sure how that happened
<SomeRandomPony> I don't have heterochromia
<AlienEd27> Okay, i don't have a heart condition, it's all tied to my breathing pattern
<Chimera> And on top of that
<Lil_B> alexxm i read threw the Wiki-Article that got posted, these different colours can be partial, like only a Stripe in one eye
<Chimera> I'm suppose to be in Gym right now.
<DuskStarshimmer> Love's In Bloom > this day aria :3
<alexxm> ok killerpony7733
<LoyalDash> Sylandest: I'll side with Twilight magic as the answer to that question.:3
<Chimera> But NOPE.avi
<Sylandest> LoyalDash: hehehe, works for me! :D
<LoyalDash> Sylandest: Yesh, it sounds reasonable enough.
<MadSurge> Sylandest: Luckily I'm a very un-hairy guy and I can't get past "shitty stubble" :D
<AlienEd27> I'm fine as long as i don't go from a close-to-sleeping state and right into activity
<Sylandest> LoyalDash: wait, does that mean I have magic now? 6_9
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis from my eye view my left is blue right is 95% green with a tint of blue somewhere in the corner of the pattern

<EspyLacopa> Of course.
<SuperGotenks1989> Yo Sylan.

<GilDash> Om: Can I have some cream with my coffee? ;)
<Inquisitor> it's like I'm really in the 80s again
<Om> GilDash: I don't even want you to have the coffee!
<Iron_Edge> User0: Maybe some kind of plasma musical cutie mark...hmmm
<GilDash> Om: Please! :)
<Glacymr> drf likes facebook now
<Om> GilDash: No.
<GilDash> Om: One day, Omffee...
<User0> Iron_Edge: But I'm a computer engineer, and a juggler, and a chainmail(ler?), and a builder, and possibly an artist... not just a musician...
<Skylands> 10...
<Skylands> 10I hate my dad
<Iron_Edge> User0: Ah, but one of these skills is slightly stronger than the others!
<User0> probably engineer...
<Nick> why D:
<Skylands> 10He booked us for two days in Tennessee
<Iron_Edge> User0: And thats your challenge. To find out which one it is ^-^
<Om> GilDash: And won't that be a fun day for you. Until then. No. And more No.
<|Discord|> I know how to call a chicken! Scoota loooo scoot scoot scoot a loooo

<Sylandest|Writing> GilDash: I'll just leave you two to have your fun :$
<Iron_Edge> kirzstryfe: You drawing?
<Skylands> 10June 18, Pokémon Conquest will arrive from Amazon
<Om> Sylandest|Writing: >_>
<Skylands> 10It will be delivered at my dad's work
<User0> Iron_Edge: but what happens if my engineering overlaps my music (once I make a distortion pedal)?
<Nick> so whats the matter with that?
<alexxm> hey |Discord| hows your day been
<Nick> just you'll miss the delivery while you're away?
<Skylands> 10No one will pick it up (he works for himself)
<Sylandest|Writing> Om: I am removing myself from the situation, as you wished. You did say I wasn't helping, after all :P
<Nick> also WHEN IS THAT GAME GONNA GET A EU RELEASE ANNOUNCEMENT!!??!1
<kirzstryfe> 8,6yeah
<Skylands> 10A video game package sitting next to a door with tons of other suites nearby for a few days
<Nick> ah
<Skylands> 10left unattended
<Skylands> 10>_>
<GilDash> Om: There's only so many times you can say no, Omffee. ;)
<Nick> oh I see D:
<Iron_Edge> User0: Depends is it your passion? Do you wake up everyday just waiting for the smell of the next tool or piece of tech you get to dig into?
<Nick> well if it gets nicked he should reinburse you for it :\
<drfsupercenter> 03this is why
<drfsupercenter> 03get AceKard, download ROM, problem solved
<|Discord|> alexxm: Great actually
<alexxm> what happened |Discord|
<Skylands> 10he booked this behind our back too..
<|Discord|> alexxm: And you?
<Skylands> 10I don't want to go
<Iron_Edge> User0: -lol- When i get to work nothing fills me more with energy than the smell of melting metal, blazing hot fires steaming the air and the crisp pungent aroma of burnt leather. ^-^
<Skylands> 10We've been to Tennesse every other summer, same hotel, same area
<Nick> ah
<Iron_Edge> User0: I know it sounds weird but its what I love to do ^-^
<Om> GilDash: I cant spam it. Sometimes i'll mix it up and say Hello no.
<Skylands> 10Same everything
<alexxm> i'm good |Discord| got a trial shift at a cafe i gave my cv to
<Skylands> 10For me, it's a HUGE waste of time
<User0> Iron_Edge: that makes perfect sense.
<Skylands> 10But my mother won't let me stay home alone for two days, so
<GilDash> Om: No spam from my end. Just all my love, and then some. ;)
<|Discord|> alexxm: sOUNDS GREAT
<|Discord|> alexxm: Caps lock sry
<Iron_Edge> User0: -lol- I can smell your sarcasm :|
<Om> GilDash: Oi...
<alexxm> yep |Discord| if it goes well i'll have a job
<GilDash> Om: Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy!
<LoyalDash> No way.....the song...:)
<Vordox> GilDash: Yes?
*Gunthler ponies Nittany_Discord
<Om> GilDash: xD
<killerpony7733> GilDash hehehe ozzy :D
<drfsupercenter> 03so in other words, you're complaining that you get to go on vacation instead of playing Pokémon the very day it's released? :P
<User0> Iron_Edge: No, really, that smell has been linked with what you like to do
<Alchemist> alexxm: thats awesome :) I myself will be going to a job interview to a tannery.
<Nick> actually I would complain too *runs
<User0> alexxm: good luck
<alexxm> hope that goes well Alchemist
<GilDash> No one did, Oi, Oi, Oi. No one?! >_<
*Nittany_Discord 11,01puts ponies on Gunthler
<alexxm> thanks User0
<Nick> jk but its happened too many times I've gone on holiday when somethign is happening the same day
<Gunthler> Yay ponies :P
<Skylands> 10No. I'm not comfortable with a package just sitting next to a door for a couple days. Tons of other people walk through there
<Nick> including the darkrai event from years pack
<Om> GilDash: Remember, you get none.
<Skylands> 10>going to the same place every year
<LoyalDash> Nittany_Discord: Everyone has a pony on their head.>_<
<drfsupercenter> 03you can just complain to Amazon if it gets stolen LOL
<Skylands> 10or every other
<|Discord|> Nittany_Discord: Do I get ponies? No. ok...
<drfsupercenter> 03and they'll give you another
<Skylands> 10Sure
<Nick> well if you're getting it from amazon there's a good chance it'll come a day early
<Alchemist> clarification: tannery=/= a place where people go to get a tan. tannery as in leather tannery.
<Iron_Edge> User0: -lol- well yeah. I mean not everypony will realize there talent by smell. But for me its like how GIlDash enjoys Om's ears. You cant explain it really, but there's something there that makes it worth moving to go and do -lol-
<Nick> ordered games through the post usually sometimes do
<Skylands> 10Nick, how many days early?
<Skylands> 10Because the day before is a Sunday
<Iron_Edge> User0: My talent fuels me in other words. :)
<Skylands> 10Post offices aren't open on Sundays
<Om> Iron_Edge: Does everyone support that thing -_-
<Iron_Edge> Om: The ear thing?
<GilDash> Om: Yes. I'm lovable, see? ;)
<Sylandest|Writing> Om: well, if your ears taste like coffee, apparently, we do
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs |Discord|
<Nick> ah :\
<Om> Let me see if I can find a picture that equals my dissatisfaction.
<|Discord|> Nittany_Discord: :) thank you my dear friend.
<Nick> but yeah it sometimes happens my uncle got Battlefield 3 two days before store release
<GilDash> Om: Good luck with that. :D
<Sylandest|Writing> GilDash: we may have prodded him a wee bit too far :$
<Iron_Edge> Om: Shes weird, but ya' gotta admit she is just a silly filly. And the more you reject her ear nom's the more shell latch to you im guessing. IDK.
<GilDash> Sylandest|Writing: Pssh! Not far enough I say. :D
*alexxm hugs |Discord|
<GilDash> Iron_Edge: You don't know me very well, do you? ;)
<killerpony7733> Om how can't GilDash be loveable?
<Sylandest|Writing> GilDash: there's never an end in sight for you, hehehe :$
<Skylands> 10Maybe I'll get lucky and it will arrive on Saturday
<Om> Iron_Edge: I can see that.
<GilDash> Sylandest|Writing: There is. It involves a kick. :D
<LoyalDash> GilDash: Are you doing your antics again?:D
<|Discord|> What if Valve made a game that combined Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress 2 and just named it "3".
<Iron_Edge> GilDash: -lol- :D Im just a blacksmith kid. I dont know anything about ear nomming -lol-
<Sylandest|Writing> GilDash: ooh...good point :$
<Om> killerpony7733: Oh let me count the ways.
<Nick> yeah!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm currently streaming Retsuparae at Bronyfunds. I'll be playing a game when I'm done with some job hunting.
<Skylands> 10but gosh this boils my blood
<Nick> it can happen honestly
<Skylands> 10My dad can't be patient and wait for the big vacation trip we plan in August..
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Good luck with the hunt. I know what that crap's like. :(
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: Are you an good with metal?
<User0> Iron_Edge: well, there are a bunch of smells that invigorate me, including dust (taking apart old things), hot metal (building/disassembly/solder), cutting wood... apparently ozone from my plasma speaker ('-.-), what else...
<Iron_Edge> Nittany_Discord: There always looking for blacksmiths. The work is ropugh but the pay is good.
<Alchemist> If anyone is from the UK, can you tell me what are the chances for a eastern european guy with a masters degree to find a job over there?
<drfsupercenter> 03and here you were complaining about being stuck in Ohio but now you're complaining about going on vacation? LOL
<Nick> where you going for that?
<Skylands> 10Florida, prolly
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Iron_Edge: I'm looking for teaching or research.
<User0> Iron_Edge: Violin rosin has a pretty distinct smell...
<alexxm> Alchemist i don't know this the closest i've come to getting a job and i'm 18
<Nick> if I was booked a vacation to I dunno...Greenland I wouldn't be happy about it :\
<Skylands> 10Destin, FL, we always go there too but I don't mind as much because yaysunning
<Iron_Edge> User0: -lol- well maybe there is something that links all of those things. As far as I know i think there are specific types of engineering that take those into factoring.
<Nick> I love Florida
<Nick> I was like a kid reborn when I went there six years ago
<Skylands> 10I was complaining about being stuck in Ohio for the summer?
<Skylands> 10I don't think I did.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Even if I were to look for metalsmithing, I would probably not have any better luck getting a job in that field as I do now with the places I'm applying.
<drfsupercenter> 03you do at random times
<drfsupercenter> 03when your parents piss you off
<User0> Iron_Edge: computer engineering - the smell of old coffee, and the smell of stale cheetos dust from the keyboard
<Skylands> 10For the summer, no
<Skylands> 10but yeah
<Skylands> 10I want to move out
<GilDash> Alchemist: You've got as much chance as someone native to the UK. That is to say, not good.
<Alchemist> alexxm: from what I gathered I see that most british people frown upon foregin labour, especially people from poland/east europe....
<Chrysalis> Alchemist usually becuase foriegn labour is not only cheaper its better
<Alchemist> GilDash:I think its still much better than in Hungary.
<Chrysalis> british people have no work ethic
<GilDash> Alchemist: Not *all* of us do. :)
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Oi! I do! :|
<User0> Chrysalis: America is no better...
<alexxm> Alchemist i'm not like that
<Lighty> 13http://puu.sh/Aufx <-- found this gem in my old library
<Om> I cant find one
<Alchemist> GilDash, alexxm: thats why I said MOST and not ALL :)
<User0> Chrysalis: I'm the perfect example, I'm at work and I'm in bronystate...
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis foreign labor is hardly the answer :'(
<drfsupercenter> 03>making Windows look like OSX

<killerpony7733> User0 explain that like how does it work with how you have it as a job
<HyperMetalLugia> like a toss
<User0> I'm studying computer engineering and I try to get code to do what I'm told that it should do...
<HyperMetalLugia> next up- Having the entire screen be just one *huge* taskbar
<Nick> a toss
<Nick> which I do not give
<killerpony7733> User0 ah i see

<HyperMetalLugia> https liunk plz
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<User0> some days are better than others...
<Alchemist> I should've went for IT instead of chemistry. both my roommates are in that field, one has a bachelors, the other is doing his master's and they both are bombarded with job offers...
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohthere
<HyperMetalLugia> Okay

<Skylands> 10Still using that wallpaper
<User0> Alchemist: Comp Enge, and Comp Sci tend to be needed... but it does take a lot of patients and problem solving...
<drfsupercenter> 03why not?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's only the best wallpaper ever
<Skylands> 10Just pointing it out
<drfsupercenter> 03no intention of changing it
<Barbetos|AtWork> Jackle App right?
<Om> I still don't understand the reason behind your fixation on me GilDash.
<Skylands> 10Spaaace
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't see the point of changing wallpapers every few days
<drfsupercenter> 03considering I hardly minimize all my stuff anyway
<User0> patience* (obviously english isn't that important)
<drfsupercenter> 03generally I'll have Firefox or equivalent fullscreened on left monitor and IRC on the right :P
<Lighty> 13am i the only one that doesnt like Win7 gadgets?
<GilDash> Om: I don't understand why you bring me up every now and again, Om...
<Alchemist> User0: I know because I usually hear when my roommates get fed up with a 3000 line code and cant find the problem :D
<drfsupercenter> 03yes.
<Ray> 02Nope

<Ray> 02Hence why you can dissable
<drfsupercenter> 03especally when your taskbar is like 3x the normal size :P
<User0> Alchemist: the code base for where I work is magnitudes larger than that...
<GilDash> Om: I didn't say that. ;)
<User0> Alchemist: the one file I'm working on right now is 5545 lines long
<Lighty> 13i dunno, dun care
<Alchemist> User0: I guessed so, but consider that they both study so they are not yet working on "real" projects.
<Lighty> 13i liek it this way :3

<Panda> Sylandest|Writing: sorry i didnt see your ping ^^
<Stallion_of_War> kirzstryfe: That was a good 30 seconds I managed to catch!
<GilDash> Panda: Oh, what did Om and you get up to? ;)
<Panda> GilDash: you are loosing your touch xD
<Om> GilDash: A leap of faith would require I have something to belive in. And hope for.
<Sylandest|Writing> Panda: hehehe, only kidding :D
<Panda> GilDash: nvm, i thought you would never notice XD
<GilDash> Om: I'll catch you. ;)

<Shizuka> 13Refresh your streams please~
<Om> GilDash: Right. Cuse that is what I want.
<Panda> GilDash: :D
*Iron_Edge refreshed
<HyperMetalLugia> If you gave a mac user Ubuntu, they wouldn't be able to tell the difference because there is little difference :D
<killerpony7733> Oh dear doom 3 :O
<Om> Iron_Edge: There is a difference in not fearing death, and seeking it out.
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03see, so much for originality
<GilDash> Om: You'll never know if you don't try. ;)
<Ray> 02Well
<Ray> 02F my life
<Stallion_of_War> aww :(
<drfsupercenter> 03at least Windows XP made a somewhat unique GUI
<killerpony7733> What a awesome game minus its extreme jump scare
<Iron_Edge> Om: Oh, I was going with the assassins creed version -lol-
<drfsupercenter> 03as did Vista/7 with the Aero themes
<alexxm> this should be good
<Ray> 02Brb, getting jap 3ds
<Lighty> 13theming =/= originality?
<Ray> 02I had enough unlocalized games
<drfsupercenter> 03if you use theming to rip someone else off, sure

<GilDash> THAT'S FUCKING DOOM3, I KNEW IT! :D
<Lighty> 13i dun rip off, only the taskbars
<Om> GilDash: And if I have no need to know. Why would I try eh?
<killerpony7733> GilDash you don't say?
<Lighty> 13then using someone else's wallpaper would be rippin off too :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sucks that I never finished this game on stream.
<drfsupercenter> 03except that those images are actually made to be wallpapers
<User0> GilDash: it did kinda say Doom3...
<GilDash> Om: That's a poor excuse, Omffee. ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03I had to pay to get a membership at Digital Blasphemy XD
<Lighty> 13so, these bars too
<drfsupercenter> 03which is fine, that guy's awesome
<GilDash> User0: I mean, just from the loading screen I got it.

<Lighty> 13xD
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<killerpony7733> Nitanny_Discord it's a great game despite extreme use of jump scares
<drfsupercenter> 03ripping off people is one thing
<GilDash> Panda: I try with *everypony*. ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03but don't mention stealing art on TST
<drfsupercenter> 03you'll burn in hell for it
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03(though if you want any Digital Blasphemy stuff I can loan you my account *cough cough*)
<Om> GilDash: You don't have verry good reasons, so I don't need very solid excuses.
<killerpony7733> GilDash that you do :D
<Panda> GilDash: as long as you dony go on my territory im fine *growls*
<Lighty> 13i dun need that
<CrimsonPhoenix> Doom 3?

<GilDash> Om: Fun. That's enough for anypony. :)
<GilDash> CrimsonPhoenix: Aye.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh hey it is
<Lighty> 13and i used a special program made for changing that theme and such
<Panda> GilDash: that was a joke btw XD
<alexxm> hey CrimsonPhoenix hows your day been
<GilDash> Panda: Please, I'd be tempted anyway. ;)
<pony_2279> what is this?
<Sylandest|Writing> GilDash: dont know if should continue trying to write or stop to hang and watch stream. suggestions? :D
<Lighty> 13i has now: Custom bootlogo, Custom OS, Custum Startorb, full custom OSX Dock, and nice colours :3
<Panda> GilDash: hehe
<CrimsonPhoenix> Slept horribly, my new mouse arrived, looking up some houses.
<Om> GilDash: Only. Fun. -__-
<GilDash> Sylandest|Writing: I love Doom3 and I never write. What am I going to suggest. :D
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL custom OS
<Panda> Sylandest|Writing: watch what GilDash and Om will do next ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03yay sugar coating?
<killerpony7733> Sylandest what you writing on?
<Alchemist> Doom 3?
<Sylandest|Writing> Panda: I like your idea, lol :D
<drfsupercenter> 03"I resized my icons, look at how much of a mad hacker I am!"
*drfsupercenter hides
<GilDash> Om: Yeah. That thing you don't know how to do. ;)
<Lighty> 13i love customizing, everytime i get a device, i NEED to do stuff to it
<Panda> Sylandest|Writing: hehe its like they are a couple... without being a couple ;) twice the drama xD
<Iron_Edge> Shizuka: -lol-

<Om> GilDash: I know how to have fun. Just. Not with other poeple. Often.
<Lighty> 13never said it

<Lil_B> I still don't know fully what"dusts" means... does it mean that I get covered in dust?
<GilDash> Om: I don't view crows as macabre, for the record. And to me Doom 3 is just a very good game, nothing more.
<Om> GilDash: Yes, but your intrests are starting so seem rather dark :)
<Magical_pablez94> did i derped?
<WindWhistler> Lil_B: It means you get dusted.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Demon: "Surprise!!" Doom Marine: *shotgun*

<MegaMoonShine> That thing is alive!
<GilDash> Shizuka: Heh, he's got nothing on me. :D
<Alchemist> just gigantic guts hanging from the walls. nothing special :)
<Dark_Horst> somehow i'm thinking deadspce was scarier... and you even got used to that real quick
<Lil_B> Magical_pablez94 for me a brony is someone who is way more into MLP than me... I just watch it sometimes (the last time was i think a month ago) and I'm in this stream here daily (that and I like good Artwork and Music by the community
<alexxm> why is it becoming more organic
<Wrek> 05gna lie downm, bb all<3

<MegaMoonShine> Stop trying to kill me of cuteness CCCP!
<Dark_Horst> the guy who designed the primer on that grenade deserves buckshot to the face
<alexxm> how come Dark_Horst
<Magical_pablez94> Lil_B: i don't watch ponies daily... but i'm a brony anyway and i'm here almost everyday and love ponymusic and ponyart and above all PONY TUMBLRS *drolls*
<Lil_B> I just had an awesome Idea... how about Doom2, with Ponys? ... no, bad idea, unless you change the shooting into something else XD
<CCCP> MegaMoonShine: :3
<Barbetos|AtWork> Some one get the Mars Sysadmin to fix that network error!!
<Dark_Horst> alexxm: took way too long to go boom
<Kammerjunk> I just realised that I've been listening to smooth jazz the entire day.
<Shizuka> 13it's so smooth
<Shizuka> 13you can't take it?
<Om> GilDash: I understand that. I was just epistemic about crows and theri common veiw, and you know alot about Doom. Just making a light connection. I wasn't trying to insult you :(
*GilDash slides Kammerjunk across the floor.
<Shizuka> 13the club cannot even handle you?
<Kammerjunk> I'm slidin' out of this chair.
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: hai
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi
<Magical_pablez94> Lil_B: after dat ddom2 thing about ponies... u definetly are a brony. :D
<MadSurge> Kammerjunk: are you slipping out of your chair?
<Spriggals> I like portals

*Nittany_Discord 11,01slides along the floor
<Shizuka> 13and MORE
<alexxm> hey Kammerjunk hows your day been
<Kammerjunk> Slow.
<Dark_Horst> i went through the entire balloon party album today. after that my brain felt partially raped and it enjoyed it
<GilDash> Om: I know. It still winds me up when people make the assumption that I like crows so I must be macarbre. They are really amazing birds.
<CCCP> http://derpy.me/DBdI1
<Dark_Horst> it's a LONG album
*Barbetos|AtWork trips of Nittany_Discord "dafuq?"
<Barbetos|AtWork> over*
*GilDash uses Nittany_Discord as a surfboard.
<Kammerjunk> CCCP: :why:
<Alchemist> Magical_pablez94: I think a significant difference is buying mlp merchandise. While many people do, I dont and never will. But the term "brony" still has no official definition.
<Lil_B> Magical_pablez94 me too, I think the other reason i don't want to call myself that is, I don't really like the word itself, and that thing with the Doom 2 Ponys was more like a joke... (which i wouldn't mind to see in reality :D )
<MadSurge> CCCP: :'(
<CCCP> Kammerjunk: sorry :3
<killerpony7733> GilDash thats why i ask about it instead making a really stupid assumption :)
<Vordox> Wrek!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Pawnch!

<Lil_B> Alchemist excactly, thats with all these words that have no clear definition, its different for each person
<Shizuka> 13i love the subtle breathing effect
<MadSurge> HOW DARE YOU PUNCH ME *shotgunn'd*
<Om> GilDash: Alright. I appologize.
<Dark_Horst> is doomguy loading two shells at once into his pumpgun?
<Magical_pablez94> Lil_B: change ur sex and use "pegasister" :D:D:D
<Dark_Horst> how the hell does a loading system like that even work?
<Magical_pablez94> gender
<Magical_pablez94> dammit
<GilDash> alexxm: No, and I'm not interested. :D

<Lil_B> Magical_pablez94 nope... to painful... I wouldn't be a good woman XD

<Dark_Horst> we need more
<Iron_Edge> Shizu is a heavy??? -lol-

<Magical_pablez94> Wrek: if u don't mind i'd like u turn off dat 6mess/10 secs kicking... it's kinda awfull when u wanna correct ur self u know?
<Vordox> In Doom 3, Doomguy appears similar to his classic Doom incarnation, with the exception that his facial features are not concealed
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I never found those.

<pyrocatboy> alexxm Dunno.
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: A mod I'd assume.
<MegaMoonShine> Suddelny redness!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Holy shit tripin balls
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think Shizuka is cheating anyway. Always at 100 health.
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: I know a fair amount of this game and there are no light amplification goggles in there.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Nittany_Discord you mean the night vision? I think it is a mod.
<Alchemist> MadSurge: where was that first coined? I only remember it from Max Payne 2...

<GilDash> Om: That's my line! :D
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Ray> 02Oh
<Alchemist> Sumica is actually a decent shot. I watched an LP of this game made by theNecroscope and he wasnt that good.
<TheDreamShark> sorry shizuka, wasnt sure, but you could get the bfg a little bit ago :(
<Vordox> Wait wuut?

<Panda> Shizu-chan is DED
<MadSurge> DED 2
<Alchemist> Dark_Host: because on Saturdays they have the usual movie night, the trilogy marathon is an extra, not a substitute.
<Ray> 02Since now with the many games that aren't going to be lolcalized
<Ray> 02I'm starting to have an urge to import
<GilDash> Om: It's a shame you won't let me teach you what I want you to learn. ;)
<Aurora> what questions are these
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did something explody come and kill Shizuka?
<Om> GilDash: Cant always get what you want.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That wasn't me.
<pyrocatboy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m473f23Aho1rriakmo1_500.jpg LOL

<Midnight_Tempest> it was the demon version of Nittany_Discord...
<Aurora> I get the feeling she wouldn't be the person to ask about that
<Ray> 02Voltage and electricity stuff
<Aurora> wait what
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey all
<MegaMoonShine> pyrocatboy: lol indeed :D

<MadSurge> I'd actually like to see female dragons. Just to understand more of the dragons' society :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I would never go into the game except to give her a hug. She would probably still shoot me by mistake, though.
<Panda> CCCP: im gonna pront that out and post it at my school :D
<Om> GilDash: And how has that worked so far?
<Aurora> I mean yeah you can wait for her I guess
<Spriggals> Omnomnom
<Aurora> but seeing as she dissappears for months at a time
<Panda> Nittany_Discord: :( my thoughts exactly
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: by..."mistake" you say? like in the beginning with all the humans?

<RainBroDash> 10IMissOsamaBrony well whom is usually the object, not the subject. To say 'whom are you', 'you' is the subject. If you were to ask like "To whom am I speaking" then it'd be whom. It's not really a matter of what's 'proper'

<Ponies47> sub06905: Fruit scares me
<Kosoveon> nick, what aurora means is that I am going from a senior from high school to a freshman in college
<Nick> ah thanks
<Kosoveon> yeah
<Aurora> 6it's also used as an insult, as freshman are rather stupid
<Aurora> 6most of the time
<Aurora> 6like
<Om> GilDash: I still don't like it.
<Aurora> 6REALLY STUPID
<Aurora> 6because they haven't broken into life at the school

<Nick> xD
<Nick> heh well that was me at uni this year, it was a Lot different from college
<Orange_sub06905> Ponies47: i am now a fruit :$
<Aurora> 6when you're a high school freshman, you're still young and stupid cuz middle school is where they cram all of the young 6th graders with the older but not mature 8th graders
<Aurora> 6so HS freshman tend to be really immature
<Kosoveon> I don't know about "stupid" as much as "unknowledgeable," although there are those freshmen that think they are all that
<pyrocatboy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3jsswHTGz1r3gomwo1_500.jpg
<Ponies47> Orange_sub06905: One fruit does not make me snap. Lots of ponies must be fruit for me to loss it
<Kosoveon> both in high school and college
<Aurora> 6by the time they're seniors, they're top of the school food chain and are very self centered, which is AWFUL to be when you enter college freshman status
<Om> GilDash: Fine.
<Staraptor> 2Staravia what :O /late
<Aurora> 6nah
<Orange_sub06905> Come on everypony become a fruit for Ponies47 :$!

<Kosoveon> lol wow
<Aurora> 6of course, I'm giving nick the definition of why freshman is used so much in movies
<Staraptor> 2I imagine it's quite a change

<Staraptor> 2O_O
<alexxm> hey Arteza147 hows yoru day been
<Jim> hey Arteza147
<ZappyTheUnicorn> alexxm: Our school holds a discovery camp for preschool children for two weeks during the Summer. I signed up as a helper.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello Arteza147
<Staraptor> 2I watched the one where he evolved lol
<alexxm> how did that go
<Nick> but lol CITV was advertising 'new' episodes of pokemon...it's still the D/P/P saga
<Nick> fgs MOVE ON ALREADy Dx
<Arteza147> alexxm: WWell considering the fact that i had half of my foot burned off in surgery...... Alright

<Cypresswolf> I got another call from some political survey group earlier - wasn't in the best of moods at the time either - I kinda snapped at the person who called me when I heard the words political survey - :S gave the poor caller a short cuss out before hanging up the phone...
<ZappyTheUnicorn> alexxm: Today was not bad. Pretty exhausting though...
<sub06905> TF2 - Engineer Song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHu1RASUUPY

<alexxm> pyrocatboy the last film i saw was hot shots part deux is that bad
<Nick> but the thing about the UK is do something they like and they'll love it for eternity

<Aurora> 6if you're doing it to have a good time, then fine
<ZappyTheUnicorn> alexxm: yeah.
<Staraptor> 2Drinking doesn't always equal drunk though
<Aurora> 6drunk personalities take on and amplify the emotions you have at the time of drinking
<alexxm> what did you say my chat derped
<Arteza147> AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<Nick> in terms of drinking, I drink sociably in quiet places close to home like pubs

<Calcos323> cowvarkian: True, but tobacco is my main source of nicotine
<Diglett> alien 2
<Ascendant> Well
<cowvarkian> well, thats nice for you Calcos323
<Ascendant> I could possibly have it rotate quit messages
<SirGanjalf> http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRSdfNswIUjnfeE_JneE7_4n-TOBRmxbaWXlhj5DCkwWsMfdrLRrBnqARG2Bg
<Dashite> Does no one read the news? :/
<Losttimes> We would send in Fluttershy, but she had go to see an "Iron Will" something.
<Midnight_Fyre> AdamThePony: We do not speak of the latter
<Obsidian> Shizuka: Lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol Shizuka.
<cowvarkian> too expensive for me Calcos323
<AdamThePony> Terraforming...
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<Ascendant> But then I'd need to oper up ScriptBot so I can have it rotate the message
<drfsupercenter> 03how
<Calcos323> cowvarkian: No it's not. Smoking is the worst decision I've ever made
<derpy_pony> he will die in a honorless way
<AdamThePony> They still use that?
<Aurora> 6which is technically correct, chimera
<Aurora> 6lol.
<Judge_Holden> Thats slang for bein a hooker
<derpy_pony> because corporation
<drfsupercenter> 03that's too much of a hassle for ScriptBot IMO because it still goes down from time to time
<cowvarkian> yeah, I know Calcos323 twasn't being sincere
<Fenr> the same company that sent you to die
<junh1024-XD> inb4 drf is not an online supercenter

<Ascendant> well I'll just run a python bot from one of my servers
<Darf14> She has to finish the fight
<Dashite> Fenr: see they aren't total bastards!
<drfsupercenter> 03I thought you meant ScriptBot would be responsible for replacing the Mibbit quit message
<Chimera> roara lolyah :P
<Ascendant> And it doesn't need to be up 24/7
<Fenr> yeah
<SirGanjalf> inb4 getbackonthepony
<drfsupercenter> 03if you mean just change it whenever, then yeah k
<Fenr> they are really good peoples at the core
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah having them random could be funny
<Ascendant> ScriptBot will just rotate the message
<alexxm> stop calling her kiddo shes decades older then you
<Distortion> Second chance to face a horrible monster!
<Ascendant> And if it goes down, it'll just use the old message
<drfsupercenter> 03screw rotating, can we make it completely random? :D
<Dashite> Darf14, but this is only the second part of the series, not the third.
<Calcos323> Nice place she has there

<Nyria> When I first watched this movie I thought that the motion tracker sounds were my speakers breaking~
<BlueFlare> 02true :[D
<Dashite> Sumica: I was banned from using the flamethrower. :/
<Dark92Enigma> ponibas|AFK It's a Street Fighter (movie) reference. That's the money M. Bison has as his capitol
<drfsupercenter> 03why should making people go blind be acceptable at all?
<Meanwhile> Distortion: They weren't aware of what the aliens were like at the time. No point devoting heavy resources to something that's potentially easy to deal with, from a buisness point of view.
<drfsupercenter> 03but whatever, I won't argue
<Distortion> They said it was aliens on the shp.
<Calcos323> Dashite: The day Bison graced your village, was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday
*drfsupercenter has sensitive eyes, so sue me
<AdamThePony> Motion Trackers are worst HUD
<StinkomanFan> alexxm, They've got a drunk, an idiot, a mute, a kid who won't shut up, somepony who fakes there own death, a guy who's gun SHOOTS MEDICINE, and a loony who shoots rockets at himself

<StinkomanFan> It's just fair that they'll die
<Aurora> 6just gonna point that one out

<FairysHuff> @Shimmer Yes, shame the new version, from vapcom I think? was so bad.

<Darf14> Dang Gerbals!
<Meanwhile> Goddamn gerbil.

<Dark92Enigma> SO?
<Losttimes> NOPE! Chuck Testa!

<Nyria> Oh god a giant gerbal~
<Ascendant> I think it's acceptable as a joke
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm saying, those colors are banned for a reason, so why should people be allowed to use them?
<alexxm> hamsters are best aliens
<Calcos323> KILL IT
<Polydunami> Okay, my ping should work now.
<StinkomanFan> alexxm, the idiot is the Heavy and the guy who fakes his own death is the Spy
<Aurora> 6a joke
<Obsidian> Nittany_Discord: Me too
<Aurora> 6like
<drfsupercenter> 03I was just telling him as he's the one who did it.
<SirGanjalf> See, told you about gerbil feeders!

<Distortion> Don't leave the gerbil.
<Aurora> 6that was
<alexxm> thanks StinkomanFan
<Nyria> Shepard: So that's were my hampster went~
<Judge_Holden> errr how da fuq did the hamsters survive!?
<drfsupercenter> 03I generally complain when *anybody* does it...
<drfsupercenter> 03because it hurts my eyes >_>
<Midnight_Fyre> Gerbil is probably starving
<devildog> hamter blow it up
*Shimmer noms Nittany_Discord
<Ascendant> But not constant use like using that text colour script you use
*Polydunami glomps Shimmer :3
<Meanwhile> Acid for blood. Goddamnit aliens.
<SirGanjalf> Judge_Holden: Too small to be fecehugged?
*ponibas goes off to make sure Alien Swarm is installed
<StinkomanFan> HARVEY, HARVEY, HARVEY THE WONDER HAMSTER!

<Judge_Holden> SirGanjalf: no, how dey not starve to death? unless the survivors made feeding gerbils a top priority
<Sumica> 00,10Secured my ass
<Nyria> Ta ta cachi01~
<AdamThePony> Fun Fact: You can actually simulate that acid look with Acetone and Styrofoam
<Meanwhile> "secured"
<Vordox> Nitt went explode when "love this" XD
<alexxm> who does everything the aliens take over become more organic
<Fenr> sure guy with no combat experience AGAINST HUMANS
<Ascendant> in moderation, stuff like that is fine
<Calcos323> Once again, bad leadership is going to destroy them all
<Fenr> the arie is surely ALIEN proof
<cachi01> bye!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Everyone loves me explosions.
<Ascendant> It's not like he uses it every line
<Losttimes> Knows Alien is there, dosen't find Alien, Area Secured.
<Meanwhile> In this case meaning "Mostly unexplored and potentially hazardous"
<Litwick> This place is about as secure as a Kleenex.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Nittany_Discord: eeyup
<Litwick> A WET KLEENEX.

<SirGanjalf> Judge_Holden: Aliens attacked not so long ago/huge ass gerbil feeders
*ponibas cries
<ponibas> i have to reinstall

<Ascendant> drf you can ignore it
*Shimmer steals Nittany_Discord's duster and runs away
*alexxm hugs ponibas whats the matter
<ROHKARA> I'm pretty sure a face hugger is big enough to eat a gerbal
<Dashite> ponibas: that's what you get for not having everything installed all the time.
<StinkomanFan> FUCKING TEAM KILLING PEICE OF SHIT
<ponibas> I have to reinstall Alien swarm
<Ponies47> *explodes*
<ponibas> no biggie
<Fenr> yes...just...this was a bad idea
<Ascendant> it's not like you have to look at it 24/7
<Meanwhile> I'm pretty sure facehuggers lack the organs to eat anything.
<Sumica> 00,10MCP is best CPU
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Come back here Shimmer.
<FairysHuff> I just thought of something awesome.... AVP LARPING ^_^
<ponibas> I do have to watch my HD space
<Vordox> Why are they going alone...?

<AdamThePony> Didn't marines later have scouters as part of their uniforms?
<StinkomanFan> SCP?
<BlueFlare> 02Actually, it’s already/almost gone XD
<ponibas> lol, I like the Tron HISHE
<Distortion> The G-Force will avenge you!
<SirGanjalf> ROHKARA: Facehugger don't eat. They just "copulate" with your face:|
<Colt_of_Personalty> Gerbils have been breeding, eating their mates, breeding, eating their mates, etc etc
<Ascendant> Screen size, depends
<Dashite> Power is still up, what happened to all the lights?
<StinkomanFan> I prefer the SPC

<Arteza147> Here comes newt!
<Meanwhile> I love that it's apparently the scene of a big fight but there's no blood or bodies or anything. It's damn creepy.
<BlueFlare> 02but if your text was that small, it wouldn't hurt
<ponibas> Did you see Deep Blue Sea? A goddamned shark ate me!
<drfsupercenter> 03orly
<derpy_pony> always go alone!
<Fenr> the big gun sure will come handy in those small spaces
<Polydunami> ... but gerbils are so cute. How could they be so sadistic? :'(
<StinkomanFan> ponibas, I loved that movie!
<Polydunami> jk
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Simple Poo Creator?
<Dashite> Meanwhile: the aliens were hungry
<AdamThePony> See, this is why you have a sidearm, dipshits
<Shimmer> Nittany_Discord: Catch me if you can!
<Sumica> 00,10I played this game on a computer back ages ago.
<Meanwhile> Dashite: So hungry they ate the blood off the floor.
*Shimmer uses portal gun to create portal to Equestria and jumps through right before it closes
<devildog> wonder if fluttershy could befriend an alien
<SirGanjalf> Hamsters planned this, i tell you hwhat
<ponibas> Shimmer: also a good movie
<Meanwhile> Your face gonna get hugged.
<Fenr> oh hi,we are just taking a nap before facehugging you
<derpy_pony> no one ever suspected a hamster
<Aurora> 6keep talking
<Dashite> Meanwhile: nah, the bloodstains were all melted away by the acid.
<StinkomanFan> I tricked my little brothers into watching Deep Blue Sea by saying Samuel L Jackson was the hero
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Dead face huggers.
<Polydunami> See, hamsters are the Scarfies of the real world.
<Aurora> 6it moves the text up the screen

<StinkomanFan> I hate children
<Meanwhile> She looks like shit.
<Obsidian> Its okay. We only tried to shoot you.
<ekips> how could she survive for so long?
<derpy_pony> she is a shapeshifter
<Aurora> 6mainly cuz I'll admit (probably the first to admit) BlueFlare gets a lot of crap from people here
<Dashite> ...
<Midnight_Fyre> yes
<Lamp> Yes
<Colt_of_Personalty> little girl is the cat of this movie?
<Dashite> She's a vampire!

<devildog> she a zombie
<Arteza147> NEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWT
<Drake> 04yeah, but NS is a mod and she's used it plenty of times without getting on trouble so some people might mistake it as favouritism/abusing power
<StinkomanFan> AdamThePony BUT FRIENDLY FIRE'S ON!
<Darf14> at least she knows how to survive
<Lamp> There's a girl in this movie?
<AdamThePony> DAMN!
<devildog> nice house
<Aurora> 6welcome to the hell hole that is being a mod
<Distortion> Oh sure Ripley does not let the man into shuttle but she wants to protect the little sirl who might be infected?
<Lamp> I agree
<alexxm> how long has she had to live on her own
<ponibas> howd she get beads???
<StinkomanFan> THAT explains the hamsters being alive!
<StinkomanFan> She fed them!
<Vordox> I'm sure she's infested... :P
<Darf14> good point
<AdamThePony> First rule of infection movies, always shoot first.
<Fenr> you are going to be ok...up to alien 3 at least
<Sumica> 00,10damit riply cant you go in to an alien situation with out picking up strays.
<Lamp> Anyone else play TF2?
<Midnight_Fyre> Lamp: Yes. This is one of the few examples of a sequel that involves a kid where the kid doesn't end up making the movie worse
<Sumica> 00,10first the cat now a kid.

<Obsidian> Ponies47: Dont do it
<Distortion> Concentrate on Ripley's hair, it is far more bizarre than anything she has seen on the ship.
*ponibas paints a white strip on a black cat

<StinkomanFan> Fun fact: Timmy Turner is voiced by Twilight Sparkle
<Lamp> devildog...(sexy voice)
<drfsupercenter> 03there's only so many times it's "funny"
<Aurora> f*ing enforce it til they cry

<AdamThePony> Wow. Talk about blunt.
<RustyMeat> buffer?

<Judge_Holden> Ripley looks stoned
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd actually make him cry but then you'd yell at me for it :(
<StinkomanFan> So now you're imagining Twilight Sparkle being eaten by Zenomorphs
<AdamThePony> Tara Strong also voiced Raven
<Calcos323> BUFFERING
<drfsupercenter> 03but nah

<Aurora> 6if someone deserves it
<ekips> that face
<Darf14> Ok who let derpy take over the stream?
<Aurora> 6they deserve it
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord blew up FMLE: :P
<Drake> 04I swear BlueFlare only used it like, once
<Fenr> as usual,we get the best still frames when the stream derps
<drfsupercenter> 03why do you think I don't like banning people
<StinkomanFan> *Xenomorphs
<PrincessLuna> Dashite: :D
<BlueFlare> 02Actually, my eyes start to hurt if no one uses color. That’s why I don’t talk on #P-O very much
<BlueFlare> 02XD
<Meanwhile> God actually had Tara Strong voice the human race.
<AdamThePony> Ironically.
<Fenr> this one is a perfect "oh shit" face moment
<Espeon> 06I actually think
<Aurora> 6I've seen people like Ascendant and espeon use it several times
<dalekkahn> It won't make any difference because BUFFER
<Losttimes> Meanwhile: This explains EVERYTHING
<Aurora> 6which is why
<Aurora> 6this is funny
<StinkomanFan> TWILIGHT SPARKLE IS EVERYPONY
<RoboGerbil> in 15 mins we wont need rockets to fly through space
<Kyu> 07speaking of which
<Espeon> 06if the rules say those colours are banned, they should be all-around banned
<Aurora> 6and kyu
<Dashite> Vordox: He nuked it from orbit
<Obsidian> Screencap anypony?
<Ascendant> ironic how Articuno said that drf and Aurora are "an absolute pair"
<Om> That face says, I missed you buffer

<Espeon> 06like, even as xDDD funny jokes then people should be told to not repeat it
<Aurora> 6absolute what

<Aurora> 6absolute opposites maybe
<FairysHuff> Dammit you guys are making me want to be social and sit cuddled up with someone while watching a film. DAMN YOU ^_^
<Calcos323> Um, can anyone explain why stream no werk?
<StinkomanFan> Ripley Can't Beleive it!
<Losttimes> This is face I will see in my nightmares.
<AdamThePony> And I will call it morpheus.
<Drake> 04Absolute idiots.
<Espeon> 06because otherwise it becomes all "Okay but how much is acceptable as funny joking xDDD and where is it breaking the rules?"
<Deajer> ...THEY BLEW IT UP!
<Barbetos> Hm. Is there something on the stream?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL Drake

<Fenr> acid shower
<Meanwhile> That looks painful.
<junh1024-XD> related: [03:06] <prunedtree> when people don't understand a paper, they usually think it's their fault... it's pretty intimidating :|
<junh1024-XD> [03:07] <prunedtree> but it's pretty funny when you see a paper where they pretend they have a principled approach, and magically reach the final results, while it's pretty obvious they stumbled on them ;)
<StinkomanFan> Polydunami, the one who was eaten by the T-Rex
<Polydunami> Okay

<StinkomanFan> It's like Evil Dead up in this bitch?
<AdamThePony> Did nopony attend science in these marines?
<ponibas> or at least commandeered it
<Darf14> Those Marines are very unerleveled to tackle them
<alexxm> why don't they know acid for blood = shoot far away from them

<Staraptor> 2What did you do to my brain D:
<Colt_of_Personalty> That was a satisfying crunch
<StinkomanFan> Acid proof wheels
<ROHKARA> Wouldn't the acid have burned the tires
<ponibas> Sumica it wasn't in the script
<StinkomanFan> always useful
<Dark_Horst> surprizingly easy to break for a tank
<Skylands> 10Fried it
<RoboGerbil> lets open the sunroof
<AdamThePony> Hey yall, the tank is on fire, we don't need no water, let the muthaf*cka burn.
<Judge_Holden> Dashite: they busy wiping out the twilight cast
<Midnight_Tempest> these are spess mehrines based on the US Army... of course they are gonna be useless...
<Polydunami> I will be leaving within half an hour.

<RoboGerbil> how long is night? 16 days 23 hours?
<Barbetos> Kill it!
<Deajer> they are severely inebreated.
<StinkomanFan> I like Hudson. He's reacting the way most of us would be
<Barbetos> KILL IT WITH FIRE!1
<AdamThePony> Actually...
<Fenr> btw,hudson has taken his half-melted arm quite well
<AdamThePony> That's a good idea.
<Cypresswolf> Sumica: Boil 'em, Mash 'em, Stick 'em in a stew! Hope you've got a strong stomach
<StinkomanFan> Fenr, he's just hiding it
<alexxm> Judge_Holden ok iirc the whole ship was mostly an egg carrier
<Dashite> Fenr: that's because it half melted his brain in the process
<AdamThePony> I should suggest Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within for Next Week.
<Dark_Horst> how can they read this shit?
<AdamThePony> It's the perfect B Movie.

*Fleta wonders who hit him in the head with duct tape O.o
<Fenr> how can we name that gun...the awesomemcguyversubmachinelaungergun?
<Darf14> Shes after Mother Brain
<Distortion> Why do ships and buildings have self-destruct procedures?
<diglett> she has main character desease meaqning she cant get hurt
<Vordox> Fenr: Close enoug
<cachi01> Fenr: duct taped gun
<AdamThePony> DO-DO-DO-DO, DO-DO-DO-DO.
<Midnight_Tempest> Ellen Ripley, Xeno Hunter Extraordinaire

<OtakuTom> I've never actually seen any of the good Alien movies...heck, the only one I ever remember watching is Resurrection...
<Barbetos> I wonder if this is a recuring theme in Ellen Ripley's life. Everywhere she goes the place ends up getting destroyed in a nuclear explosion.
<drfsupercenter> 03you should watch more porn then
*drfsupercenter runs
<Dashite> Darf14: I don't think Newt can energy drain the queen though
<Staraptor> 2Lmao no thanks
<Fleta> Smoke 'em if you got 'em
<Vordox> OtakuTom: You'll love this then
<Fenr> There is no alien resurrection
<Midnight_Fyre> Lady who worked on a mining ship is better aty fighting aliens than space marines
<Meanwhile> ^
<Fenr> *jedi mind trick*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Movie skipping :<
<Ascendant> lol coughing up blood
<AdamThePony> If Metroid gets a movie, they need to have Ripley as Samus.
<AdamThePony> Just saying.
<TheRareP0N3> what happened to the girl?
<Vordox> HAI BUCKERS; Time to "BUY SOME APPLES" your PLOTS!
<TheRareP0N3> lol
<cachi01> Fenr: duct taped gun or the iwillpwnubeyatch
<Meanwhile> Ripley is more badass than your entire Marine Corp.
<HoboAddiction2> Like the I like trains kid except: "I like self-destruct buttons"
<Sumica> 00,10you should see her weading day Barbetos
<Pinkies4thWall> AdamThePony: but samus is blonde.
<Meanwhile> TheRareP0N3: She got nabbed by an alien.
<Dashite> AdamThePony: I think she's kinda old to play Samus now...
<Distortion> She look crazy
<User0> I love how she has absolutely no armor on...
<Midnight_Tempest> alien resurrection was directed by Joss Whedon... just to let you know...

<AdamThePony> You have to remember, she's got Chozo blood.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Movie has to derp at the end.
<Midnight_Fyre> TheRareP0N3: Captured by baliens. Ripley is going to save her
<Fenr> armor VS walls-eating acid
*Chains shoots at Nerom
<AdamThePony> and she was in stasis for a long while.
<Fenr> makes sense not bothering with it
<TheRareP0N3> lol
<Pinkies4thWall> Chozo blood is best blood
<Distortion> He also directed Avengers. Win some, lose some.
<OtakuTom> Midnight_Tempest: IIRC, it was his first movie, and it was pretty bad.
<AdamThePony> So that'd kinda make sense.
<Sumica> 00,10her popcorn is done
<panda> Saturn you there?
<Chains> Awww
<Shamroc> Midnight_Tempest: you seen kirz anytime today?
<Dashite> Pinkies4thWall: Seems legit
