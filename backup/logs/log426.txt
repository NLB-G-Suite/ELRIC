<XAX> what plushy? D: I wanna see
<Gunthler> Vinyl: Well, I came to the conclusion that would be completly normal for a Brony to feel becasue, what the ponies experience from the show is something that every human desires... and to experience that for themselves, with their own eyes, their own feelings, and being able to actually communicate with them... Its something that just seems, right...
<iammrcrap> seeya
<Kandarihu> Okay. What's the server name?
<Shizuka> 13not sure if that's as simple as putting $5 into steam wallet, but there you have it

<Jaketehsnake> Victory! Shizuka VICTORY!
<cachi01> PEELZ
<Twi_Fi> @raritymeter
<junh1024-XD> DSLRs have changeable lenses, this one doesn't
<Steven_Magnet> 6 You are 67% rarity. (51)
<Polydunami> This is something
<RawketLawnchair> Victory?
<ehm> sadfus
<XAX> sad fic
<Twi_Fi> My rarity meter is going down.

<cachi01> mutherfughker
<BronyJenkins> fugkers?
<YamaTHou> fugkes?
<YamaTHou> rs*
<Digitalis> HAHA!!!
<NightSeas> 02but no, not a dSLR
<NightSeas> 02SLR stands for single lens reflective, and in this case it’s not that
<Twi_Fi> Break everything!
<ghostbuster_EXTREME|> what is this
<YamaTHou> break all things!
<Polydunami> ghostbuster_EXTREME|: Exactly
<BronyJenkins> Everything needs text-to-speech.
<Digitalis> ^
<NightSeas> 02the single lens is the changeable lens
<XAX> ^^
<drfsupercenter> 03so what's the actual diff
<twilight_sprinkle> v
<Jaketehsnake> TF2 with text to speech would just be Penis Penis Penis
<junh1024-XD> i thought it was single lens reflex
<Twi_Fi> Could you imagine chat with text to speech during a new MLP episode.
<Polydunami> If only this chat had the text-to-speech feature
<ghostbuster_EXTREME|> WTF R THEY ON THE MOON ?????????????????
<cachi01> Jaketehsnake: hat hat hat
<NightSeas> 02nope, single lens reflective
<Polydunami> Wait, is that the discussion now?
<BronyJenkins> ghostbuster_EXTREME|: eeyup.
<ehm> Open the pod bay doors, Sam.
<Jaketehsnake> Shizuka, You must find Wooona before youreturn home
<ghostbuster_EXTREME|> oh dear.....
<dalekkahn> Phase4 : make bronystate text-to-speech please and thanks
<Polydunami> Different game? Okay
<Kyu> 07SLR/DSLRs use a mechanical flap to control the amount of light that goes into the sensor/film
<Shane377> hey SuperBrony64
<junh1024-XD> Single-lens reflex camera - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
<junh1024-XD> en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera
<junh1024-XD> The historic 1949 Zeiss Ikon VEB Contax S, manufactured in Dresden, the first pentaprism SLR for eye-level viewing. A single-lens reflex (SLR) camera is a .
<YamaTHou> what are they doing right now?
<Kyu> 07in addition to the aperture, etc
<drfsupercenter> 03so basically SLR has removable lens, that's the diff?
<NightSeas> 02yep
<Kyu> 07no
<Polydunami> So what happened with Spectrum_Rush last night?
<XAX> i laughed too hard at that, Shizuka
<Jaketehsnake> Shizuka has me in fits of laughter
<NightSeas> 02there's more though
<Digitalis> Oh god Shizuka xD
<Polydunami> He fess up?
<YamaTHou> HAHAHAH
<Steedius> God that mousetrap one got me haha. I'm laughing so hard.
<YamaTHou> me sides hurt
<Kyu> 07there are point and shoots with interchangeable lenses
<Aurora> 6heheh
<Aurora> 6aperture
<Jaketehsnake> I WATCH VEGGIE TALES DAMMIT Shizuka
<cachi01> potato
<YamaTHou> POTATO!!!
<junh1024-XD> DSLRs you are p. much guaranteed like more control like ISO, apeture, shutter, etc
<XAX> Steedius: dat feel. i know it
<Polydunami> I remember Veggietales
<Barrel_of_Fun> GTA moon
<Rocklobster> hey
<Steedius> XAX: I'm glad I'm not alone. <3
<Digitalis> HAHA
<Twi_Fi> I ate veggies.
<YamaTHou> gta moon??
<YamaTHou> hahahahaha
<Rocklobster> im playin with them
<junh1024-XD> PAS can have controls like that, but it's not guaranteed (i look for models that do)
<YamaTHou> GTA IN SPACe?
<YamaTHou> epic
<Digitalis> Oh god now I'm crying
<Polydunami> Oh hey Rocklobster I saw you on the stream
<Polydunami> xD
<Digitalis> damn you guys!
<YamaTHou> hahahaha
<Rocklobster> i left
<drfsupercenter> 03so how do you tell the difference just by looking
<Rocklobster> it got borin
<Kyu> 07and the SLR part is the mirror that reflects the light entering the lens over to the viewfinder
<junh1024-XD> DSLRs also may have RAW output mode, raw sensor data, more control, etc
<Polydunami> Digitalis: Huh?
<YamaTHou> <Digitalis> I know dat feeling
<junh1024-XD> PAS almost certainly don't
<Shizuka> 13wat...
<Polydunami> Oh yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<Polydunami> Righit
<Digitalis> I was laughing to hard xD
<Shizuka> 13quit drops you from the game
<Shizuka> 13that's just dumb
<Polydunami> Whoops
<GabeMoist> runs so slow for me
<homage> lol
<YamaTHou> ???
<Revolution08> that was fun
<Rocklobster> can we play somethin like tf2
<Rocklobster> or l4d2
<Jaketehsnake> homage, You are second best OC ever
<YamaTHou> where is the microsoft sam voice go??
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The moon is fun.
<Rocklobster> or l4d
<YamaTHou> d'aaaw
<Polydunami> That was... a thing
<NightSeas> 02dSLRs also have focusing points on a reflective mirror that you see when you look through the view finder which are called AF focusing points.
<Jaketehsnake> Nittany_Discord, You guys had me in tears
<Twi_Fi> The moon is a desolate wasteland.
<YamaTHou> that was.....epic XD
<Kyu> 07basically if it's a point and shoot, you're looking at a digital display or through just a couple pieces of glass
<MahBoi777> the moon is awesome
<Polydunami> Hmmm...
<Kyu> 07and a dSLR is what NightSeas just said
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Try to get into the next game.
<junh1024-XD> DSLRs are usually bigger than PAS
<junh1024-XD> look at some photos of both and you'll see the form difference
<Prince_Shane377> do it
<Jaketehsnake> Nittany_Discord, I wish I could, but I have school in the morning. Can we do a game tomorrow?
<Polydunami> Egad
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh.
<YamaTHou> dat RD theme...
<Twi_Fi> RD
<Jaketehsnake> Nittany_Discord, Actually I can play one game!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01OK.

<cachi01> JEEEEEEEEEEEENKINS
<MahBoi777> Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaah!
<NightSeas> 02They’re a lot faster and have greater accuracy then other methods used by point and shoots
<Rocklobster> look at my avatar
<cachi01> at least i have scootaloo
<Rocklobster> it rocks
<YamaTHou> ?
<Rocklobster> shit nooooooo

<kirzstryfe> 1,3that just looks like a really bad plan right there
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'll never be steamfriend with Nittany_Discord :'(
<Rocklobster> HAHAHAHA
<NightSeas> 02Also, dSLRs usually have a CMOS censor, which is a lot bigger than CCDs found in point and shoots.
<MahBoi777> that moonwalk
<Rocklobster> im sry for u
<BronyJenkins> Actually WATCHING the tutorial?
<Kandarihu> I'm watching, this time
<Polydunami> How do I shot asteriks

<Ninjazz> The included "DLC"
<Twi_Fi> @raritymeter
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Major game publishers need to go.
<Steven_Magnet> 6 You are 42% rarity. (59)

<DairyCannon> Nittany_Discord would you consider Valve a major game publisher?
<Meanwhile> AppleBloom. AppleBloom. AppleBloom. AppleBloom.
<Twi_Fi> @pony

<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: I love that gif.
<pablez94> alexxm: i'm ok.... i woke up sooemthing like 20 mins ago...
<Spectrum_Rush> :)
<Sumica> 00,10Still think Notch is just trolling
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<NightSeas> 02XD
<Ninjazz> Notch never really said that he is a brony...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But most of the major publishers are akin to record labels and movie studios as they're ruining games to further their control over them.
<Ninjazz> Just, "I like the show"
<Twi_Fi> dun dun dunnnnn
<Sumica> 00,10pssssss Nitt, video ended
<Ninjazz> Kinda like my situation.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know.
<Meanwhile> Idk, Notch wanted to settle a legal issue via Quak deathmatch, seems like a cool guy to me.
<pablez94> Spectrum_Rush: i'm fine! :$
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/DLsyk.jpg
<Meanwhile> Quake*
<Twi_Fi> Video ended, time to post ponies.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Origin requirement?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Terrible ending?
<Meanwhile> All of the above?
<Radu> There's actually a par2 on this video
<Ninjazz> Something about the Day 1 dlc...
<NightSeas> 02LOL
<Radu> part 2*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01EA-published?
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/qa50b.jpg
<Ninjazz> I wouldn't know about the ending.
<Twi_Fi> @pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12Twi_Fi is 15Tw6i4st
<Sumica> 00,10Silly nitt. it's not on the disk
<Twi_Fi> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<alexxm> so what is day 1 DLC
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Part of it is.
<Meanwhile> It's DLC. On day 1.
<Twi_Fi> bleepin
<Twi_Fi> no
<Ninjazz> No. Someone found out that the DLC was infact on the disc.
<Twi_Fi> @pony
*Twi_Fi cries
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/GPyKX.jpg
<Ninjazz> But you needed to download something to unlock it. blah blah blah
<Meanwhile> @pokemon
<Steven_Magnet> 10 Meanwhile is a/an 4 Salamence
<Meanwhile> I don't even know what that is.
<Sumica> 00,10Framework for the chracter on the disk
<NightSeas> 02http://i.imgur.com/WkzuR.jpg
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Someone used a code to unlock part of the DLC.
<Twi_Fi> Me neither.
<Twi_Fi> @pony
<Steven_Magnet> 12Twi_Fi is 12Spit8f7ire
<Ninjazz> Part?...
<Twi_Fi> Okay
<Twi_Fi> That's better.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah the frameworks that tells the game there is DLC charicters
<Twi_Fi> Applejack is the most loyalest of ponies.
<Twi_Fi> That's why she is the element of....
<Radu> STAN PEE'D!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Argument of early and on-disc DLC is that it's parts of the game removed to milk consumers.
<NightSeas> 02http://i.imgur.com/97W2e.jpg
<Ninjazz> dot dot dot
<Sumica> 00,10Yeah people complained they removed parts of the game to then re sell them and charge you for data you already had.
*Spectrum_Rush checks steam
<Lighty> 06Seems legit
<NightSeas> 02Manlyguy would like that one XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I won't be surprised if that actually happens.
<Meanwhile> This here award thingy.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially with online passes.
<Radu> Am I the only one whose stream is lagging a bit?
<drfsupercenter> 03so is it better to get like 2 hours of sleep before waking up for the day, or to just stay up?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*sigh*
<Twi_Fi> Some lag.
<Ninjazz> ...
<alexxm> nope Radu i was around the trophey
<Ninjazz> Damn it...
<Radu> alexxm: Oh you.
<Ninjazz> Damn it.
<Ninjazz> DAMN IT!
<Sumica> 00,10Then again I have always thought DLCs suck
<alexxm> what Radu
<Lighty> 06red bull
<NightSeas> 02any amont of sleep unless it's only like a few minutes is better
<drfsupercenter> 03no.
<Radu> Nothing... Nothing :3
<drfsupercenter> 03@ energy drinks
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lag.
<NightSeas> 02amount*
<Sumica> 00,10they used to call them expansions
<Mutterguy> *bleeeeeeeeeeep*
<alexxm> what about stuff like shivering isles Sumica
<Twi_Fi> LOL
<Twi_Fi> That was good.
<Twi_Fi> At the end.
<Ninjazz> I miss expansion packs.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Me too.
<Sumica> 00,10and you got ahell of alot more bang for you buck when it was expansions
<Prince_Shane> haha u guys do u remeber in ep 2 s1 where the mane 6 find out luna is celestias sister and they are all leaning foward and Pinkie falls over?
<Twi_Fi> Nope
<Viri> 14hi :3
<NightSeas> 02I've pulled a few all-nighters thinking the same before, makes you feel like a dead person all day XD
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Ninjazz> You know?... I REALLY hate EA right now...
*Twi_Fi needs to rewatch episodes.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I miss gaming before publishers starting fucking customers over with DLC and bad DRM.
<Sumica> 00,10wth is shivering isles?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm almost done with this paper
*Prince_Shane stares at Twi_Fi
<drfsupercenter> 03should be done in less than 15 mins
<Kencolt> That revelation was AFTER Pinkie took a nosedive, IIRC.
<drfsupercenter> 03and I need to get up at around 7:15-7:30
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And abusing licensing.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's now 5:00
<Viri> 14I stayed awake for ~35 hours once
<Viri> 14o.o
<alexxm> the oblivion DLC Sumica
<Ninjazz> Sumica: Expansion to Oblivion.
<Sumica> 00,10never played it
<Ninjazz> NOW that was DLC
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And draconian/Orwellian EULAs.
<LightTrooper105> o.o
<Viri> 14I slept for like 16 hours the night after xD
<Prince_Shane> Twi_Fi: watch from 19:52
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And online passes.
<pablez94> Prince_Shane: i do.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The last few years of gaming has gone to hell.
<Ninjazz> Onlines passes piss the HELL out of me...
<Sumica> 00,10Supprised no one called me out on haveing me2 dlc's
<Lighty> 06my pers. record is around 36 too
<drfsupercenter> 03I always sleep for like 12+ hours if I can :P
<Lighty> 06slept till 5PM next day O.o
<Kencolt> The nice thing about playing WOW is they never ask you to pay for their DLC. Which are called patches.
<Meanwhile> But Sumica, you have me2 dlc.
<Ninjazz> Well, I never played any of them, so you're kinda doing me a favor.
<Viri> 14lol
<Twi_Fi> Prince_Shane, nah I remember.
<Viri> 14I don't like sleeping too late
<pablez94> Prince_Shane: i love that scene just 'cause there's luna. it's not that hilarious.
<Viri> 14I love waking up at dawn :D
<Prince_Shane> nah i laughed at pinkie
<NightSeas> 02If I realize I’ll only get a few minutes sleep, then I’ll go ahead and pull an all-nighter.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sumica, you can take over if you want.
<Sumica> 00,10if it makes you fell better i did't pay for them
<Sumica> 00,10oki
<Twi_Fi> Sumica is a thief.
<Viri> 14but Summer pisses me off, because to wake up at dawn I should at 5am <.<
<Ninjazz> That does make me feel better actaully.
<NightSeas> 02but I think 1-2 hours is legit
<Prince_Shane> haha Twilights stomach in ep 3 sounds like dubstep
<Ninjazz> Makes sure that EA doesn't get anymore money than they actually deserve.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I feel better when I don't buy games from EA, Activision, or Ubisoft TBH .
<Sumica> 00,10I preffer the term Privater
*Twi_Fi donates money to EA.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or THQ.
<Mutterguy> 2k all the way!
<LightTrooper105> Ubisoft for me is fine
<Viri> 14I don't trust my brain when it comes to "yeah I'll sleep only for x minutes/hours"
<Ninjazz> I thought THQ was alright.
<Viri> 14or "I'll just close my eyes"
<Viri> 14:P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Nah.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They use online passes.
<NightSeas> 02LOL same
<Ninjazz> Ahhh.
<Ninjazz> Damn it!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And on-disk/Day 1 DLC.
<Mutterguy> or is that take 2 now...
<NightSeas> 02next thing you know
<Prince_Shane> the one thing that pisses me off is when u go to rent a game and u put it in and go play MP and it says u need a online code i end up flipping a couple of tables
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01THQ is almost dead though.
<NightSeas> 02brain goes into troll mode
<Twi_Fi> Lol
<LightTrooper105> so long the game is good
<Ninjazz> Yeah...
<Ninjazz> Man, I am going to miss Company of Heroes and Dawn of War when THQ goes under.
<NightSeas> 02"I'm going to sleep for 6 hours instead, you mad?"
<Ninjazz> I really miss the days when ID was king...
<Prince_Shane> THQ is dieing =( no more saints rows
<Twi_Fi> oh wow
<Viri> 14xD
<Ninjazz> or Id*
<drfsupercenter> 03I can't do that though
<Meanwhile> Like there needs to be any more Saint's Row.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saints Row 3 was a blast.
<drfsupercenter> 03gotta turn in a paoer at 8, and then I have a midterm at 10:15...
<Sumica> 00,10yep shes is allll *bleep*
<drfsupercenter> 03*paper
<Spectrum_Rush> hah
<Kencolt> Every time I see gilda I can only think of two words. Fried Chicken.
<Ninjazz> Saint's Row was pretty cool.
<Prince_Shane> saints rows are so bucking fun
<Sumica> 00,10Redfaction killed THQ
<Prince_Shane> kicking people in the balls
<NightSeas> 02what's your paper about? o.o
<Ninjazz> One of the few games that could actually be called a game.
<Twi_Fi> Whenever I see Gilda I think eagle lion.
<Spectrum_Rush> ow
<Prince_Shane> and the awkward moment when ur character does the ball kick animation to a girl
<Meanwhile> Tourettes Pinkie.
<Ninjazz> Sumica: Gorilla or Armageddon?
<drfsupercenter> 03sociology x.x
<Sumica> 00,10Arma
<NightSeas> 02:x
<Ninjazz> Ahhh. Indeed.
<Sumica> 00,10Gorilla was awsome
<DeadpoolDash> THQ is only good for 40K games now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Geurilla was awesome.
<Ninjazz> Gorilla was freakin awesome.
<Viri> 14well, that's easy
<drfsupercenter> 03no it's not
<drfsupercenter> 03it's about a book I haven't read
<Ninjazz> GT4 in freakin SPACE!
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Viri> 14essay about sociology in a few words:
<drfsupercenter> 03dude it has to be 1000 words
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<Sumica> 00,10I love the sledge hammer
<Prince_Shane> Sumica: would a hostel movie ever be shown on BMN or EMN?
<Sumica> 00,10hard to say.
<Viri> 14"WELL IF YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME SUCH A SO HARD PAPER TO DO I'D HAVE GONE OUTSIDE AND MAKE SOME SOCIOLOGY BY MYSELF. THE END"
*Viri runs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wasn't hostel picked once, but rejected?

<Ninjazz> Ahhhh...
<KwakLad> millions?
*Spectrum_Rush shudders
<Ninjazz> Cyborgs...
<KwakLad> the human race has billions, we can spare a few million
<Invi> only millions?
<Spectrum_Rush> WE ARE THE BORG
*pablez94 starts tracking da room using magic but cannot find that fucking caos lord
<Invi> Ninjazz super Cyborgs ^^
<Meanwhile> Reapers are mechanical, but the 'metal' that builds them is made of organic material taken during that whole blending thing from earlier.
<Ninjazz> Indeed, Invi.
<Locutus> Spectrum_Rush: I am Locutus of Borg, you will respond to my orders
<valoreins> i wonder how creating metal from flesh works...
<Ninjazz> Must take ALOT of material to turn into metal.
<Meanwhile> Well, tens of thousands of humans gets you that far.
<Dark92Enigma> DISCORD. If you win the rock off..........then you must take Spike back to hell (Spike: WHAT!?) Me: Trust me, it's the only way....(Spike: what are you talking about?) To be your little BI%&&&&&&&&&!
<Locutus> valoreins: there are a lot of metal in the human body
<Mutterguy> calcium.. iron, sodium poatssium...
<Ninjazz> Daayuum.
<Meanwhile> True, but it isn't just the metal in the body they use
<Chezne> where can I get that Sea Pony Lyra? my Desktop Ponies doesn't have it
<pablez94> Dark92Enigma: r u crazy?!??!??
<Spectrum_Rush> desktop ponies they kill
<Spectrum_Rush> with teh cute
<Mutterguy> it's not a lot but they did use millions of people and thens always the carbon
<Invi> poniez are evil
<Dark92Enigma> pablez94 You never heard Beezleboss? (Tenacious D reference)
<valoreins> i think if it has calcium in that giant thing... should it be look a little... bone-like?
<Ninjazz> Just some, Invi.
<Meanwhile> Presumably they knit the base elements of the body into a structured form using the same type of nanomachines that they use for the blending process.
<pablez94> Dark92Enigma: nope.
<HyperMetalLugia> yah
<HyperMetalLugia> nprob
<Twi_Fi> Meanwhile, have you.......done this?
<valoreins> seems like it has too much iron in that thing
<Invi> Ninjazz don't you know the song ''poniez are evil''? ^^
<Mutterguy> well that's assuming it's calcium phosphate
<Dark92Enigma> pablez94 Check it out, you'll see what i'm talking about........
*Spectrum_Rush stares suspiciously at Meanwhile
<Ninjazz> I don't believe I do, Invi.
<Meanwhile> They are an amalgamation of flesh and metal at the very basest state, like melding an alloy to a cell.
<drf-Droid> is the Japanese one OK?
<DeadpoolDash> harbinger talks a lot of smack for someone who fails alot
<Locutus> genetic + destiny = genestiny?

<Ninjazz> 's pings
<Twi_Fi> NOOOOOO

<Twi_Fi> No wrath?
<Ninjazz> It seems he's a bit preoccupied.
<Radu> But I surely do need a source on dat tasty "Oh my"
<Kammerjunk> Singularity + Throw = TO THE MOOOOOOOON
<Twi_Fi> I was just worried, since the last pony that came back after being banned was immediately banned again.
<Spectrum_Rush> ok he save then
<Ninjazz> Welp, too bad for pablez
<CrazyCherry> Sumica: Thanks!
<Ninjazz> or whatever
<Kammerjunk> Radu: It's George Takei on a TV commercial.

<FillyFlam> Is that heavy melee thing specifically a biotic power, or do all classes get it?
<Mutterguy> Um not sure if it's Just Nz but if the Governor general or monarchy is present i think God save the Queen is the anthem to usse.... not sure though
<Kammerjunk> "I think the Alliance sent backup." YOU DON'T SAY.
<Ninjazz> Dat ass...
<FillyFlam> Ah. Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

<Spectrum_Rush> injoke Radu
<Twi_Fi> The bot died....

<Ninjazz> Cya RainbowAsh
<At> In school I found a bunch of people that like MLP as well as me so I decided to sit with them. I didn't mention the fact that I to like MLP, I just sat there and talked. They got annoyed and told me to go away. I really want to be friends with them. What should I do?
<Invi> c ya rainbowA...gone
<Rodonies> My life is ruined
<Twi_Fi> Troll 2 is the B movie for movie night.

<Rodonies> Antrophology isnt updated

<Ninjazz> Patience, Rodonies.
<Rodonies> D:

<At> XD
<Rodonies> yeah, the song always works
<Invi> ^
<L[a]korv> cat ./Viri > /dev/bag/masterball
<Twi_Fi> I have heard that Troll 2 is really terrible.
<twilight_sprinkle> so is wrek sober?
<FillyFlam> At: They seem like kind of a-holes to me.
<Twi_Fi> So, I sad.
<FillyFlam> To be perfectly honest.
<twilight_sprinkle> Twi_Fi: if its as bad as the room, itll be fun
<At> Yeah but if they like ponies i wanna be friends
<Rodonies> FillyFlam: Depends on what At does when hes near
<Invi> ^
<Twi_Fi> twilight_sprinkle, clips from Troll 2 are often used on youtube like the Room.
<twilight_sprinkle> Twi_Fi: i kno
<Rodonies> If I see some dude I don't know creepin on me and following me everywhere
<At> I usually sit there quietly and occasionally laugh at there jokes
<Rodonies> I would ask them to leave also
<Twi_Fi> I'm going to have to ask everypony here to leave.
<FillyFlam> Well if he's doing nothing more than just coming up and having a conversation, there's no real reason to just be all "Eww, go away."
<Rodonies> At: not that you do that
<At> They dont move, they sit down at a table for 45 mins
<Rodonies> At: Just an example
<Ninjazz> And you just sit there for 45 minutes with them?
<At> yep
<Ninjazz> Kinda explains why...
<Invi> At when you just sit there with unknown guys and just laugh with them instead of speaking, that appears a bit weitd to them
<Invi> *weird
<At> i dont know wat i could say to them tho
<twilight_sprinkle> whatre yall talkin about
*Twi_Fi does ritual to raise bot from the dead.
<Ninjazz> You could say, "I liek poniez" :3
<At> lol
<Invi> At something topic related or about school or something
<Rodonies> Ask them why they like it and if you should give it a try
<Twi_Fi> Slam your fists down hard against the table and declare the truth, "Twilight Sparkle is best pony!"
<FillyFlam> ^
<Ninjazz> ...
<FillyFlam> Only spell Rainbow Dash correctly.
<At> I don't want to instantly say i liek ze poniez, i wanna become friends first
<Ninjazz> No comment on that lie.
<Invi> At do as if you are a non brony and ask them out about the show, then admit, that you are a brony ^^
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: tis the truth
<Ninjazz> Hmmm. Nah.
<Rodonies> Twi_Fi: That wouldn't work
<Rodonies> Twi_Fi: Since pinkie is best pony
<Twi_Fi> The truth, may it spread across the land!
<At> lol i guess i could pretend not to know about it, say i'll give it a go, then the next day know everything
<Ninjazz> Real men prefer Rarity.
*Ninjazz is a real men

<Invi> At and don't just sit there and laugh ^^
<At> I wouldn't like to have to pretend not to know the show and start from scratch tho
<Rodonies> I totally should become a shrink, you know
<Twi_Fi> Rodonies, that's so devious that it may just work!
<At> shrink = psycharatist?
<Rodonies> Oh well, Back to tending my fluttershy on my minecraft :3
<Rodonies> yes
<At> k
<Twi_Fi> @pony
*Twi_Fi fails
<Randomnerd> Pretened you don't know about Ponies?
<Ninjazz> Blasphemy!
<At> i see them drawing pictures of ponies and theyre really good at it so if i said that i just watch the show and nothing more they might feel as if im pointless
<twilight_sprinkle> one does not simply pretend he does not know of ponies
<Randomnerd> That seems dishonest
<Ninjazz> BOOM HEADSHOT!
<Ninjazz> Sounds like a tight knit group, At.
<BronyJenkins> Hi everypony.
<Twi_Fi> When my friends bring up bronies, I tend to play dumb.
<Randomnerd> Honesty is more important than anything else
*Kammerjunk begins chanting unintelligibly in an ancient, archaic language. Steven_Magnet rises to the Heavens and is never heard from again.
<Twi_Fi> Hi BronyJenkins.
<Ninjazz> BronyJenkins, welcome.
<Invi> At you can ask them about their favourite pony
<Kammerjunk> So in other news, I'm going to go do archery-stuff.
<At> U mean ask "who is best pony?"
<Randomnerd> lol
<BronyJenkins> :3
<Ninjazz> I wouldn't do that...
<Twi_Fi> Have you done archery before?
<twilight_sprinkle> who are we talking about anyway
<Ninjazz> But yeah...
<Kammerjunk|Away> Few times.
<Invi> At no, who is FAVOURITE pony ^^
<Randomnerd> The students asked teh Buddha, "Who is best Pony?"
<LiquidFire> Hi!
<Twi_Fi> Best pony, you say?
<Ninjazz> LiquidFire, welcome.
<Rodonies> Best pony is Badass Twilight
<Twi_Fi> Hi LiquidFire.
*Ninjazz cough Rarity cough
<At> IMO RD is best pony
<FillyFlam> Well to be honest, if they're really the kind of people you want to hang out with, they won't see you as pointless because you don't draw or write fanfics or anything like that.
<Rodonies> after that its a close battle for pinkie/twilight for me
*Ninjazz sighs
<Invi> Randomnerd and the budda answered everypony is best pony
<Randomnerd> ^
*DISCORD why its me obviously
<Randomnerd> Invi: Congratulations, you have acheived nirvana, :)
<pyrocatboy> Vinyl Scratch is best pony.
