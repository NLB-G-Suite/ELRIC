<Vordox> IT'S HIM!
<StinkomanFan> ZOMBIE PONIES?
<Deadlypon3> Aliens are invading the earth, but not physically; since space travel takes so much time, they rather use communication devices to transport themselves in 'ideas' Thus 'infecting' humans
<princess> that reminds me of story of the blanks
<princess> JOINNN USSS XD
<MadSurge> VAMPIRES
<Michael> lol
<Vordox> It's him! What's his name!? The one with the mask and then Sword!
<Vordox> An baseball bat
<Michael> dat was powerful
<Mozdoc> And suddenly, epic battle appears.
<Deadlypon3> So if you are infected, you have an alien entity in your mind in the form of an 'idea'
<Bronysith> I feel like watching Breaking bad
<princess> see what you did dio :S

<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: he's a major villain, he can't die!
<Deadlypon3> AJIsawesome The first scene is a dude who is infected by a simple flash on his computer; the next thing he knows, he is on top of a building, ready to jump because the alien could not understand the 'pain' of being a physical being
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: ?
<princess> DARN U CELESTIA :[

<princess> my "Friends" joined a queen chrysalis group so im spying
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not severe enough that I actually wear them IRL though.
<princess> roblox 3:
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: yet
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, I believe the word you meant to use is penchant?
<princess> they banned me for posting a animated picture
<Polydunami> Not quite a Corporal Klinger, eh? :3
<Eli> who doesn't like maid outfits? tho i must admit i prefer them at a fine female form
<Ponies47|Homework> And this is the song I blast into my ears everyday while I'm at school http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FvXznPl1J8 I do it ALL DAY. But of coarse not in class :P
<thelonepony> Roblox? similar to minecraft princess ?

<Ponies47|Homework> RAWRity: Oh myyyyy. She looks awesome ;3;
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Polydunami: No. Only here.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: so far
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: but one day...
<princess> Random Fact: line up the first word of every month and you'll get a amazing word
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Jason?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: Dunno.
<princess> yup
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01jfMAMJASONd

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Actually, jfMAMjJASONd
<alexxm> shawn michaels?
<AJIsAwesome> No love for Shaun? :D
<thelonepony> X
<RAWRity> One day, you'll get a maid costume in the mail. You won't know who sent it, or where it came from, but you won't throw it out. You'll just toss it in the back of a closet, laugh it off, and tell us about it.
<princess> nopr
<thelonepony> SHAWN!
<RAWRity> Then as time goes on
<Eli> i thought he meant Jfmamj. it's an amazing word
<princess> i must see shawn befor ei accept shawn :S
<princess> i accepted jason but i must accept SHAWN
<ASoftFluffyThing> relevant: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efZ0n2jpPJw
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Game over people, game over.
<RAWRity> You'll start thinking about it. One day you'll take it out of the packaging and just look at it, then put it back and go back to what you where doing. Then a few weeks later you'll take it out again, and decide to hang it up.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03My Little Dashie has been made into a film.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1PE0jRP-jo
<AJIsAwesome> My jimmies remain unrustled.
<Polydunami> Oh dear
<RAWRity> Then finally, after seeing it day after day, hanging there when you get dressed, you'll slip it on. You'll look at yourself in the mirror, maybe even sit around the house in it before you take it off and hang it back on.
<princess> Anypony wants to see silent hill relevation? :$
<thelonepony> the movie?
<AJIsAwesome> No thanks, princess. :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Scoot-Scootaloo: I think there are more than one projects.
<RAWRity> Then finally, after you've had it for months, you'll put it on, and you'll step out the door in 4 inch stilleto heels, and walk down the road, never looking back.
<Eli> Scoot-Scootaloo: and i thought you were serious
<princess> yea i saw some more trailers :D
<RAWRity> *The End*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RAWRity: Question is, who's going to get my address and send me a maid outfit?
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: We have our ways.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And will they know my size?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Scoot-Scootaloo, you and I have a mission....to find who did this and have a nice friendly talk with them
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Damn right son...
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03damn right.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm completely unfazed by this. :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because your story will fail if I put on the outfit and it doesn't fit.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I might as well tell Jenomoprh to stop his movie production ;_;
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: like I said. We have our ways.
<Polydunami> But if you have a girlfriend... :3
<Polydunami> Well, just a thought :P
<princess> how about paranormal activity AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, I would not recommend sending it now because I live with someone that wouldn't understand me in a maid outfit without booting me out of the house.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But if your story comes true, I'll show up at your door in the dress and offer to clean your house.
<princess> silence?
*alexxm kidnaps princess

<Canadian_Brony> Polydunami I am not kidding you, but the crime only is a problem if you're downtown, but roads and air quality is everywhere. Part of the reason I'm up here is because my mom went to UNBC.
<Polydunami> Oh dear
<Canadian_Brony> yeah
<Canadian_Brony> at least the cars move in rush hour up here
<RAWRity> I live in in North Carolina. We rarely have traffic more crowded than a fast-food drivethrue
<Polydunami> You mean than AT a fastfood drivethru?
<RAWRity> no
<RAWRity> picture drive-thrus
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ded?
<RAWRity> now you have the streets of greensboro and kernersville
<Canadian_Brony> RAWRity that's because your drive-thru is the equivalent of Vancouver's rush hour
<Eli> princess: i really tried to laugh about it... i really did. how old are you again?
<princess> Roblox accused me as a hacker >:O
<Canadian_Brony> I'm trying to think of something clever to help that sink in.
<Polydunami> Yeah, I don't even think even HALF of our roads are paved.
<Polydunami> In Canada, that is
<Canadian_Brony> at least we have roads
<Eli> Polydunami: what are unpaved roads? have never seen such thing
<Polydunami> It's very crazy when you think about it, Eli. We have roads that are just plain rocks.
<Canadian_Brony> My parents went to LA early in the summer, and on the way back, my dad talked to a lady who has never been to Canada. She asked him if we had roads. He said yes. But then she said "No, I mean, like, paved roads."
<Canadian_Brony> two guys behind him burst into laughter
<Polydunami> Did they talk about igloos as well? :D
<Canadian_Brony> no
<Eli> Canadian_Brony: here it's simple: the road is unpaved, you're in a forest. sometimes not even then.
<Eli> Canadian_Brony: and if a road has holes, give it half a year and you have a complete new road in place
<Lyra`> i lagued

<SaxyPretender> 0,14Fighting is Magic won't be done for a while, i'd think
<Canadian_Brony> Pink3 no clue about the game, but he probably uses a special audio-video converter to turn something such as RCA (yellow white red) into something the computer can take as input, such as USB.
<Canadian_Brony> also, hi Shizuka

<Kandarihu> Only female character in the game. And she's morbidly obese.
<Bronysith> CriticKitten: i am an adult
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: That's what I was thinking too. :D

<p4ngya> yeah r&c had an amazing soundtrack
<CriticKitten> What's funny is that this game aimed to copy Brawl, but....basically botched the whole thing by making killing much harder and fighting somewhat lifeless. O.o YOU HAD ONE JOB.

<CriticKitten> *isn't a carbon copy of Snake's
<Bronysith> SaxyPretender: what kind of fighter is P4A? 2d or 3d like tekken?
<Eli> this game seems copied, but god that music
<Stormy`> I don't exactly have the money to buy ponies now though :P
<Eli> metropolis... R&C... childhood
<Stormy`> although I do have a decent collection
<RAWRity> Overall, I think it's an improved game over B/W. The re-imagined gyms and setting were fun, the gameplay was smoother and better balanced, and there were more varied battles, helped by the expanded Regional Dex. However, the plot ultimately wasn't as well executed as B/W, with an ending that's satisfying, but not very enticing.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol dat echo :D
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I think I have a competition that weekend....I have to watch in on the DVR by myslef...:'(
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> when they get more in stock ill get you one as a thank you for reshipping
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and ill pay for shipping.

*AJIsAwesome eats the bread and jam :3
<thelonepony> can i has some Laurayne :3
<AJIsAwesome> ............
<Arcane> RAWRity and pray dual chop wont miss
<Kandarihu> Kingdom Hearts is one of those lines of games that I always wanted to play, but my Nintendo fanboyism prevented me from.
<Fluttershyfan158> Sora vs Twilight Sparkle.
<Laurayne> You Eat This And you Wont Know Where You Are For A Week =w=
<Mutterguy> .... um pass. my stomach called and it said Gone fishin'
*BroPony|MEDIC is the only on who knows of twisted metal :(
<Kandarihu> Well, my fanboyism of the time.
<HoodyNinja> Hamsters might be cute, but damn they be stupids
<thelonepony> okay :3
<superretroworld> Kandarihu: but its on DS
<HoodyNinja> Fluttershyfan158: Vampires? Sora. The pony? Twilight
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Same here.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know of Twisted Metal.
<AJIsAwesome> Except that I didn't have a PS2.
<thelonepony> D:
<Arcane> My very first memory in life is me and my brother playing a twisted metal game on the ps1 BroPony|MEDIC
<Fluttershyfan158> No.. KH Sora, Vs Twilight the pony
*BroPony|MEDIC hugs Nittany_Discord
<Laurayne> I VOTE TO HAVE A MLP FiM WORLD IN NEXT KH!! :D
<HoodyNinja> twisted metal <3
<Silver_Soother> Nittany_Discord: Twister Metal; that was a game I could play over and over again.
<Silver_Soother> Twisted*
*BroPony|MEDIC hugs Arcane
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs BroPony|MEDIC
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: Make that happen. :D
<thelonepony> ^:D
<Fluttershyfan158> Sora getting into a fight with Discord..Priceless!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. I enjoyed TM2 through to Black.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
*BroPony|MEDIC hugs Silver_Soother
<BroPony|MEDIC> 3 and 4 didnt exist
<Kandarihu> superretroworld, I'm also a stickler for continuity. And I don't think I'd feel right getting into the Kingdom Hearts series without starting with the first two games. I'm not so opposed to the PS2 as I used to be, though.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I never picked up the latest game. Maybe later.
<Laurayne> His Cutie Mark Would Be A Key Hole xD
<HoodyNinja> Discord would turn the keyblade into a cheese wedge
<Mutterguy> I think Disney needs to buy hasbro first
<Fluttershyfan158> Or a keyblade
<RAWRity> ...
<BroPony|MEDIC> Nittany_Discord: Its not that bad, but it needs alot of improvment
<RAWRity> OH MY GOD
<Silver_Soother> Nittany_Discord: I'd say rent the newest one. For me, it didn't have the charm of the original. It's dark like Black, but without all the endings.
<Kandarihu> Laurayne, FiM isn't Disney enough
<Fluttershyfan158> What about Riku?
<Fluttershyfan158> what would his mark be?
<Randomnerd> Hrm.
<Fluttershyfan158> or Kiari?
<thelonepony> Fluttershyfan158: a heartless egnima?
<RAWRity> So guys, apparently during filming of "The Hobbit" films, Stephen Colbert visited the set, and in an interview he hinted he might have a cameo in one of the films!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14wow
<Laurayne> Kandarihu: I Reject Your Reality And Substitute it With my Own
<Mutterguy> but that does mean SQUIRRELGIRL KEYBLADE!
<Randomnerd> FiM is not Disney, but like all animation, it kind of lives in Disney's shadow.
<Fluttershyfan158> ..Maybe
<Arcane> BroPony|MEDIC But i was just a tiny pony at the time and thats really all i know about TM
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that'd be neat, he /is/ a bit LOTR fan
<Bronysith> RAWRity: wah
<HoodyNinja> RAWRity: Is... is that good?
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: yes
<Mutterguy> and/or incredible hulk teaming up with Goofy
<BroPony|MEDIC> Arcane: I know EVERYTHING there is to know about twisted metal
<HoodyNinja> inb4 Smaug is voiced by stephen colbert
<Bronysith> My god Breaking Bad
<Fluttershyfan158> I think it'd be awesome to have Discord fight Sora..THINK OF THE POSSIBILITES!
<Kandarihu> Well, if a new Kingdom Hearts game leverages Disney's ownership of Marvel, it might be possible to include something based on G1, provided it's stripped of everything that Hasbro still owns: Spike, Applejack, and the name My Little Pony.
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: nah, Smaug's being voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: who is also playing Sauron/The Necromancer
<HoodyNinja> But... the necromancer was only mentioned in the hobbit...
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: so basically Benedict Cumberbatch is all the villains in The Hobbit films.
<RDash5000> roosterteeth is the best http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCTdCnC6j7w&feature=g-u-u
<HoodyNinja> he never appeared...
<superretroworld> Kandarihu: well just give it a try
<Kandarihu> But you should expect to see X-Men in the same game.
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: hia
<HoodyNinja> Damnit
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: yeah, but since they ended up expanding it to 3 films, they're going to show The Necromancer and all the stuff with him
<Mutterguy> Like i said incredible hulk teaming up with Goofy
<Fluttershyfan158> If we end up in Equestria in KH3, I'll sh#@ bricks
<Arcane> Is there a stream atm?
<thelonepony> not at,
<thelonepony> atm*
<HoodyNinja> I can't wait for PS all-stars ;~;
<Laurayne> The MLP World In KH Should Just Have Sora Helping The Mane 6 Fight Discord And Them Useing The EoH To Vanquish Him :3
<Arcane> thelonepony Kay i just wanted to make sure i wasnt bugged
<StinkomanFan> Hi~
<thelonepony> np :)
<Kandarihu> If the Disney side is going to incorporate their Marvel properties, then the Square Enix side might as well include the stuff they own. How about Deus Ex Human Revolution?
<HoodyNinja> Oh hai
<thelonepony> Hi StinkomanFan :)
<Fluttershyfan158> Or make Discord an Orginization 13 member..That'd be a twist.
*Bronysith sighs
<Silver_Soother> Fluttershyfan158: Whadda tweest!
<Laurayne> VAT A TVIST!
<HoodyNinja> WHAT A TWEEST!
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/YokFX.png yo dawg
<Bronysith> we dont need ponies in EVERY FUCKING THING EVER
<Mutterguy> nah hasbro will just release Plutocracy of Spleens
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...that's a lot of second best pony
<HoodyNinja> Bronysith: This is just speculation, calm yo tits
<StinkomanFan> According to TF2 Dues Ex is in t6he same Canon as it.
<StinkomanFan> Sooo.....
<StinkomanFan> Yeah
<Kandarihu> Guys! No G4 in Kingdom Hearts! The only way it would work is if it's G1. So it would be Tirac or the Smooze instead.
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: *Best
<Fluttershyfan158> Bronysith: I know it will never happen..I can dream!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14*second best :3
<JRP> Hia

<thelonepony> night BroPony|MEDIC :)
<Fluttershyfan158> I wanna have Twilight in my party fighting Discord..
<VenHur> Guys, Kandarihu is right about this, I mean, the humans enter the pony world via a well.
<Kandarihu> And if it comes down to auxillary properties, there should be an interesting X-Men/Deus Ex crossover that deals with naturals who are bigoted against mutants AND augs!
<Fluttershyfan158> Hell I even have a fanfic planned..It's not a ponyfication..It's a crossover...
<Fluttershyfan158> that sounded way different in my head.
<Laurayne> RDash5000: ._.
<HoodyNinja> Should I give a small rodent candy?
<Fluttershyfan158> no.
<Fluttershyfan158> It
<Fluttershyfan158> will kill them
<HoodyNinja> Just a gumdrop?
<Mutterguy> ooooh Hasbro means you get al the D&D titles So Bigby, Drizzt and Elminster could be in your party wirth ironhide and Derpyhooves
<Kandarihu> Humans in Equestria is unprecedented at best, taboo at worst. But there's already precedent for humans in Ponyland.
<Shizuka> 13drizzt... and derpy..
<Shizuka> 13FUND IT

<VenHur> Oh. how I wished that "toy" exists...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01~yay~
<HoodyNinja> Eh, bored now
<Kandarihu> Did I miss something about Square-Enix buying out Eidos btw?
<Laurayne> Did yall Know That China Is Already In Progress Working On A Real Life Hollographic Prjection you Can Touch And Interact With?
<Fluttershyfan158> VenHur: I heard from a friend who is a conspiracy person..He may be wrong..But I can dream!
<thelonepony> Laurayne: rly?
<HoodyNinja> Laurayne: Then it wouldn't be a holograph, because you can touch it
<Fluttershyfan158> Baka Neku is in here?
<Laurayne> Yeah. In Fact They Already Have A Working Prototype
<HoodyNinja> and then the dictionary comes into play
<Kandarihu> Laurayne, I heard that China is building ghost cities that nobody is going to live in for the sole purpose of giving workers something to earn their living wage with.
<Fluttershyfan158> I love his Lyra Bon Bon fic!
<HoodyNinja> So... a hamster will die if i give it a gumdrop?
<Laurayne> Well, China Is Also One of The Most Polluted Countries In History too
<Fluttershyfan158> Maybe.
<Bronysith> Laurayne: all the dead girl bodies
<HoodyNinja> What about a brick?
<Bronysith> friggin china
<Bronysith> why cant they be lnice
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, in America, some company is building a ghost city for the sake of testing new technologies. But they're gonna be experimenting with EMPs, so that might prevent any other research until they can perfect the Faraday Cages.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14but Clinton!
<Kandarihu> Clinton isn't best president
<superretroworld> you know if mlp only could write 13 episodes, couldnt they just hire more writers?
<StinkomanFan> Teddy Roosevelt is best president!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14The man played saxophone, that alone makes him 10x better than Teddy Roosevelt and 100x better than Washington
<HoodyNinja> superretroworld: They just made this season short for no reason
<Kandarihu> Ronald Reagan is best President
<CrimsonPhoenix> inb4movie
<RAWRity> Everyone knows James K. Polk is Best President
<RAWRity> i mean, Fort Knox is named after him!
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: They probably did it to give the animators/writers a break.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Polk is a close second
<Bronysith> HoodyNinja: i loved the inheritance cycle

<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: it so simple, and so popular, that it once again demonstrated why pop wont just die already, and by becoming so popular itll just promote more of the same cheap catchy pop
<taoumi> it's not teribly hard to get the base parts. it's like a kroean verison of solja boy
<princess> two new songs i made popped up in my mind :O back to agrueing with roblox..
<cuddly_kittehs> Meow.
<Bronysith> taoumi: except gangnam style is actually good
<Bronysith> taoumi: and souja boy is fucking shit
<cuddly_kittehs> princess: Aurguing with roblox?
<HoodyNinja> twilight_sprinkle: Well, alot of people like it, and just because you don't doesn't mean you have to constantly tell people on the internet they are wrong
<princess> yea they banned me
<HoodyNinja> Im done with this conversation
<taoumi> i'm talking about the dance Bronysith and i nterms of a dance solja boy is more interesting for it's base parts
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: i actually never said "you are wrong"
<princess> and its WAY past my due time
<cuddly_kittehs> princess: what for?
<Canadian_Brony> princess ah yes, those were they days. Back when I was 11 and Minecraft didn't exist.
<cuddly_kittehs> twilight_sprinkle: It's not just about saying it, its about heavily implying it.
<taoumi> in music you are absolutly right Bronysith

<princess> shirts
<cuddly_kittehs> twilight_sprinkle: Not on purpose. I mean, its just it looks like it; thats why your getting attacked. That and the part of your argument that i saw was the bare simple basis of stating that pop should die. I agree with you, but people are still feeling alot of stuff they dont like being implied
<Canadian_Brony> RDash5000 mfw I actualy saw that irl
<HoodyNinja> I CLEAN MY TEETH WITH PAPER TOWELS

<twilight_sprinkle> cuddly_kittehs: all i said is that its cheap pop that strengthened the position of pop above other music, thats all i said. im allowed to have an opinion and express it, i didnt say anything outside that
<twilight_sprinkle> HoodyNinja: oh for fucks sake i was joking
<Bronysith> sprinkle is such a hippocrite

<RainbowPie> hey everyone
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey RainbowPie
<thelonepony> hi RainbowPie :)
<DoublePint> Is it just me or is the stream off?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, RainbowPie. :)
<DoublePint> Because our net here sucks so I never know
<RainbowPie> how are you ASoftFluffyThing and thelonepony :)
<AJIsAwesome> DoublePint: No stream.

<AJIsAwesome> DoublePint: No problem. :)
<Kinixys> Hi everypony!
<RainbowPie> thelonepony, Im good thanks :) hey Kinixys
<HoodyNinja> Kinixys: Oh hai~
<Brad> so uhhh... for this thing http://www.indiegogo.com/brony have they released the actual ad that will be played?
<thelonepony> Hi Kinixys :)
<DoublePint> Hey Kinixys
<Brad> I cant seem to find it anywhere if they have
<Buytoast> oh god, the thank you ad
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Kinixys. :)
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 people flip out about the ad
<Buytoast> that'll be a gem
<HoodyNinja> Inb4 smart people rage
<Brad> I just wanted to see what it really contained... or if its friggen weird.
<Kinixys> Thank you for the warm welcome.
<AJIsAwesome> Kinixys: Sarcastic or serious?
<Kinixys> Serious
<AJIsAwesome> Oh. :D

<HoodyNinja> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jb5onftuiw&feature=autoplay&list=PLE8C4D4F2A84C3843&playnext=4&shuffle=67140
<Buytoast> then again, it's hearsay
<Brad> They should have just bought the adspace to play ponies gangnam style.
<HoodyNinja> ^
<HoodyNinja> Damn it sprinkle isn't here
<Brad> I didnt know adspace was that inexpensive... I thought it would have cost more than $12k for 10 30-second slots.
<Buytoast> they should've used the money to go to a charity or something rather than use it to plaster their faces onto the boob tube
<DoublePint> Did I read Boobtube? Where you must tell me!
<Brad> could have used that ad space to sell sugar snacks to kids.
<HoodyNinja> Could have used that ad space for bears who can't wipe their asses
<DoublePint> HoodyNinja: Those poor bears :(
<AJIsAwesome> Then again, it's their money and they can decide what to do with it. I'm not complaining about it.
<HoodyNinja> DoublePint: DAMN YOU CHARMIN! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!
<Brad> so Buytoast the ad isn't actually public yet as far as you know?
<Kinixys> Could have used that adspace to give thanks to lord smooze...
<DoublePint> ALL HAIL LORD SMOOZE
<HoodyNinja> ALL HAIL THE HOODY

<Kinixys> Tony McBrony. XD
<HoodyNinja> ^
<DerpyMuffins> Who do you like more: S1 Luna or S2 Luna?
<HoodyNinja> DAMN YOU KINIXYS!
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Both.
<HoodyNinja> S2
<HoodyNinja> OFCOURSE
<thelonepony> Both :3
<Kinixys> _/)___(\
<Brad> I want to see another luna episode.
<HoodyNinja> S1 Luna didn't exist
<HoodyNinja> Its all a myth
<Brad> S1 luna existed in the second episode
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Mutterguy> for about 10 seconds
<HoodyNinja> brb have to pee
<AJIsAwesome> More than that. :S
<DerpyMuffins> It seems Luna is just as popular as Derpy is
<Bronysith> and chrysalis had 2 minutes of screen time
<HoodyNinja> but no one cares
<Brad> also did anyone else notice NMM in the glass thing at the very beginning of S1E1?
<LunasGuard> DerpyMuffins: damn right
<AJIsAwesome> Brad: The first time I watched I didn't.
<Kinixys> Last song I listened to was Nightmare Night.
<HoodyNinja> Bronysith: and 12000000000000 pieces of fan content
<DerpyMuffins> Why dont they show more Luna anyway?
<Brad> AJIsAwesome, I wanted it for the second time last night and caught it
<Saturn> 08,01chrysalis is best alicorn
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Why don't they show more Celestia?
<Panda|LOL> ^
<Panda|LOL> what Saturn said
<AJIsAwesome> Panda|LOL: ;3
<AJIsAwesome> *:3
<Randomnerd> MOAR LUNA!
<DerpyMuffins> AJIsAwesome: because she has better things to do than screen time
<Saturn> 08,01Winona is best princess
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<thelonepony> ^^
<Kinixys> They don't show Celestia because she's always behind the camerapony.
<AJIsAwesome> I would still like to see more Celestia.
<NoctunalBlade> Gamers Luna is best Princess ^_^
<NoctunalBlade> *Gamer
<LunasGuard> ^
<DerpyMuffins> I liked to know how Celestia got into power
<NoctunalBlade> also good evening everypony :)
<Mutterguy> MLP: Diarchy is Fascinating would selas well to the target market
<Kinixys> Hi NoctunalBlade.
<thelonepony> Hi NoctunalBlade :)
<AJIsAwesome> I'd like to see Celestia have some character development.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, NoctunalBlade. :)
<LunasGuard> why is their no queen for the ponies
<Canadian_Brony> hi NoctunalBlade
<Mutterguy> *wouldn't
<DerpyMuffins> Did they elect her or did she just put a crown on her head and declared herself Princess
<Brad> AJIsAwesome, I think the more they develop her the less "powerful" she seems.
<AJIsAwesome> LunasGuard: You do know what Lauren said about the queen title, right?
<Kinixys> Well... there is that sun thing...
<AJIsAwesome> Brad: She can still be developed AND powerful.
<DerpyMuffins> Disney made "Queens" evil
<AJIsAwesome> Just look at Shinji in the reborth movies.
<Mutterguy> AJIsAwesome i do. Disney Queens are always evil
<AJIsAwesome> Or Simon in Gurren Lagann.
<Brad> AJIsAwesome, I have no idea what that is
<HoodyNinja> Back what I miss
<NoctunalBlade> Queen Chrysalis ^_^
<LunasGuard> AJIsAwesome: I miss it
<AJIsAwesome> *rebirth
<DerpyMuffins> I kinda want to see some more Nightmare
<AJIsAwesome> LunasGuard: Miss what?
<HoodyNinja> NoctunalBlade: Glad I missed it
<AJIsAwesome> Brad: Have no idea what what is?
<Brad> I wonder if they will do more winter episodes.
<DerpyMuffins> Alright Ima be afk, ping me if there is stream
<Brad> AJIsAwesome, shinji
<Kinixys> I want to see Celestia write a letter to Twilight.
<NoctunalBlade> HoodyNinja: o lol that feel into place pretty well :D
<DerpyMuffins> Dont tab fail either
<AJIsAwesome> Kinixys: She did in the Gilda episode, but only for a couple of seconds.
<LunasGuard> AJIsAwesome: wat did she say about queen titles?
<AJIsAwesome> Brad: He's from Neon Genesis Evangelion.
<DerpyMuffins> LunasGuard: Disney made Queens evil
<HoodyNinja> I had the weirdest thought the other day
<Brad> anime I assume?
<NoctunalBlade> DerpyMuffins: we probably will lol
<AJIsAwesome> LunasGuard: She said that the title of "queen' would sound cold for Celetia, so she changed it to Princess instead.
<HoodyNinja> I imagined bronystate as a room, and everybody got a fold-up chair and sat and talked
<Kinixys> AJIsAwesome: But not an "I learned something about friendship, too!" letter.
<Cades> oh awesome
<AJIsAwesome> HoodyNinja: I imagine it as a giant theatre where people come and go. :D
<Brad> "princess celestia" flows better.
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone want to see Luna take a personal protege?
<HoodyNinja> AJIsAwesome: There's a projector in the corner
<DerpyMuffins> It'd be intresting
<NoctunalBlade> Yes, but who?
<HoodyNinja> Trixie
<Brad> I love it how mlp mixes modern tech with old stuff as well.
<LunasGuard> AJIsAwesome: Oh, that makes sense
<HoodyNinja> I have had this idea before
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Wishing Well of HORROR! / Little Library of HORROR!
<Brad> its quite funny.
<DerpyMuffins> How many filly unicorns are on the show?
<AJIsAwesome> *shrugs*
<Kinixys> I imagine Bronystate as this ride you get on that takes you through some animated enviroments as songs playin the background.
<AJIsAwesome> Too much to count?
<NoctunalBlade> im with HoodyNinja lol
<DerpyMuffins> Only one really comes to mind for Luna's protege
<DerpyMuffins> Dinky anyone?
<NoctunalBlade> well that could work
<HoodyNinja> Um... NO
<Randomnerd> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTk6eY9EY5g&feature=BFa&list=FLQtFbXHXXgEowjYbd3_9Y8w Have you ever heard RD sing?
<AJIsAwesome> It could, but I'd prefer someone more well known in the show.
<HoodyNinja> Dinky would need backstory
<HoodyNinja> She would need to be a CHARACTER first
<Hanako> implying any of the characters have a proper backstory
<HoodyNinja> and that would be pretty hard to pull off
<Saturn> 08,01dinky is celestia's daughter.
<DerpyMuffins> ^

<HoodyNinja> You get milk from breasts
<Saturn> 08,01well

<Saturn> 08,01mostly apples.

<AJIsAwesome> ........
<Randomnerd> I was the invisible man.
<LunasGuard> -_-
<flutterchu> d-did you read my chat
<Randomnerd> Like, for serious. I had on medical gauze and stuff.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm trying to remember if I saw someone like that
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I probably did, but there were so many cosplays

<Saturn> 08,01so much pizza
<Saturn> 08,01i had pizza with fish
<Saturn> 08,01lots of fish on it
<Randomnerd> Mmm anchovies.
<Saturn> 08,01indeed
<Canadian_Brony> I made cinnamon buns with a yeast bread recipe.
<Saturn> 08,01anchovies + pizza = the most amazing thing
<Canadian_Brony> I made too much glaze though.
<DerpyMuffins> No such thing as too much glaze
<Big_Macintosh_1992> mmmmmm.... glaze....
<ASoftFluffyThing> anchovies and pizza....eh....
<DerpyMuffins> I could really go for a black forest cake right about now
<Canadian_Brony> DerpyMuffins you talkin' bout the icing kind, or Glaze aka WoodenToaster?
<NoctunalBlade> not a big fan of anchovies
<LunasGuard> anchovies+pizza = derp
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<DerpyMuffins> Canadian_Brony: Both
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Cold Sleep / Bookmark / That's What She Said
<Canadian_Brony> XD
<Big_Macintosh_1992> So you know that question I asked earlier... I'd like to re-phrase: Is anyone from around MN?
<Big_Macintosh_1992> I have yet to meet a brony IRL...
<Randomnerd> Big_Macintosh_1992: Check if there's a Meetup Group for your area?
<Randomnerd> There might be one in the Twin Cities.
<DerpyMuffins> I have yet to see Hasbro sell plushies
<AJIsAwesome> They have.
<DerpyMuffins> They would make billions
<AJIsAwesome> But they're the cheap kind.
<Canadian_Brony> Hasbro makes cheap plushies, but I've never seen a Hasbro pony plush
<AJIsAwesome> http://www.hasbro.com/common/productimages/en_US/4408b8555056900b10aa2999ee978fe3/441229855056900B101223CEB1A22F3F.jpg
<Canadian_Brony> until today
<DerpyMuffins> Eh
<DerpyMuffins> Not that great
<DerpyMuffins> I seen better
<AJIsAwesome> If you're talking about high quality plushes, then I would love that.
<Canadian_Brony> and HOLY MOTHER CELESTIA WTF IS THAT THING!?!?!?
<Randomnerd> I know people took pictures of me... but well, it's a common thing.
<Canadian_Brony> It looks G3!
<LunasGuard> ^
<Randomnerd> -People thought I was Darkman.
<Kinixys> Good plushes are in the hundreds.
<DerpyMuffins> But not the thousands
<ASoftFluffyThing> Canadian_Brony, that is a pony plushie by Hasbro.
<AJIsAwesome> I would love to see Hasbro make HIGH QUALITY plushes, but not the generic ones.
<NoctunalBlade> AJIsAwesome: i saw that in Toys R Us today lol
<AJIsAwesome> That way they would make so much more money
<AJIsAwesome> *.
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome, exactly. And they know there's people who make some damn good ones too.
*Big_Macintosh_1992 is forever alone
<DerpyMuffins> A good plushie will cost ya about 50-200 US dollars
*NoctunalBlade hugs Big_Macintosh_1992 "no you're not" :)
<AJIsAwesome> Aren't there some that go larger than that?
<Kandarihu> Oh. Ththat image that AJIsAwesome is the talking Pinkie Pie doll. We saw a video the other day of one running low on battery power. Remember?
<Brad> mass produced plushies wont look the same
<Big_Macintosh_1992> d'awww thanks NoctunalBlade
<AJIsAwesome> Like $500?
<NoctunalBlade> DerpyMuffins: the one i saw was about 25 i think
<Brad> they want to keep costs down obviously so people can afford to buy them.
<NoctunalBlade> Big_Macintosh_1992: any time :)
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Oh yeah, that. :D
<Randomnerd> NoctunalBlade: , Big_Macintosh_1992 , as Mr. Rogers put it "We're electronic neighbors."
<Dken2021> hehe
<NoctunalBlade> eeyup
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Randomnerd: wish i could find real real 'neigh'bors
<PON3> lol
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Randomnerd: searching for meetup groups... all too far away...
<Randomnerd> Big_Macintosh_1992: Understandable... I have it easy, I live in the NY metropolitan area.
<AJIsAwesome> Big_Macintosh_1992: Same here.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> ah... lotsa people
<AJIsAwesome> I found some meetup places, but they're either too far away or i have stuff to do that gets in the way of going to one.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> I live in small town central MN, have no car of my own, and am living at home because I can't afford anything else
<superretroworld> i still wish to meet a irl brony before i die
<Randomnerd> Big_Macintosh_1992: The Anime Convention might yield Bronies. They go to every con.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> superretroworld: right?
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: Don't we all?
<Randomnerd> Even Chiller -a NJ Horror Convention.
<superretroworld> you guys havent either?
<AJIsAwesome> I have.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> Randomnerd: i was borderline brony last year and chickened out of the brony-going. Gonna give it a shot this year
<Randomnerd> Good, life's too short to be ashamed of little ponies on your desk.
*LunasGuard is hiding a secret "dont tell any one its in luna's room" Derpy_Hooves
<Randomnerd> (I got a little bit of heckling from my brother when he saw Fluttershy)
*Dken2021 is also hiding secrets
<flutterchu> Randomnerd: what's heckling?
<Big_Macintosh_1992> flutterchu: teasing
<AJIsAwesome> My parents don't mind me being one. My mom's okay with it, but my dad couldn't really care about it.
<Dken2021> harassment
<flutterchu> :'(
<Dken2021> the only people that know I watch the show are my cousins

<DoublePint> LadyCanary: :O
<LunasGuard> metaknight fitw
*sonicandmario85 eats theloneponys brain
<RaveBrony> Wait, you cosplay, LadyCanary? (Im slow sorry)

<SpadeMagnes[R]> It never made it into the game
<thelonepony> Now i'm a zombie, everyone escape :3
<RaveBrony> Oh cool :)

<LadyCanary> Randomnerd: I was Canary, she was Byakuya XD
<SpadeMagnes[R]> How big is Olimar?

<thelonepony> DoublePint: do it man ;~;
<RaveBrony> O.o
<thelonepony> i cant become a walker ;~;

<Canadian_Brony> Shizua x VioletVanilla x Luna x LadyCanary x Rain is best ship.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> There are alot of story aspects that never get fully explained
<LadyCanary> Preach it, Canadian_Brony

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02LadyCanary: La :3

<Derpy_Hooves> NewSuperBronyU always likes to pick the troll levels

<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its hilarious
<Dken2021> oh ,new pork city
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Me too. :D
<Sabershy> Sonic is great for racking Damage, but lacks any killer moves.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He seems to be a hit and run kind of character
<Sabershy> ^
<Dken2021> in other words, he's the lighning bruiser
<AJIsAwesome> He can be good for team battles, but alone he's pretty bad.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Isnt this banned in tournaments due to size?
<AJIsAwesome> *shrugs*
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<AJIsAwesome> I haven't been to any Brawl tournaments.
<AJIsAwesome> But this stage I HATE.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I know for a fact Great Temple is banned
<AJIsAwesome> With a fiery passion.
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: It is? How?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> The massive size and the stallign tactics people can abuse
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: What about New Pork City?
<Dken2021> one I've been to only allowed final destination to be played, and they only had one song played -_-;
<AJIsAwesome> Dken2021: That sucks.

<DaringDerpy> good morning btw
<twilight_sprinkle> gentlemen-geeky: im ok, hows about u?
<gentlemen-geeky> DaringDerpy: hell you sir
<AJIsAwesome> This isn't really embarassing to me, but this is not the best way to represent the fandom.

<DaringDerpy> No one can understand
<AJIsAwesome> Still not embarrasing. I'm pretty sure I've seen worse.
<DaringDerpy> they look like bronies...
<Buytoast> and people still wonder why people don;t like bronies that much
<twilight_sprinkle> theres always worse
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02So...this is what a brony is...
<gentlemen-geeky> i saw a trench coat
<Mozdoc> I don't think I will ever consider myself to be a Brony of this nature...

<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: No, it's not. :D
<twilight_sprinkle> yes NewSuperBronyU , good thing they arent welcome here!
<gentlemen-geeky> NewSuperBronyU: yes it is my good sir
<twilight_sprinkle> hell, if i saw one a dem bronies
<NoctunalBlade> :D
<DuskStarshimmer> What are these hedious aliens? they look notihng liek ponies or even zebreas!
<Silver_Spoon> This looks more like typical young male than brony to me...
<gentlemen-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: i did that once
<twilight_sprinkle> gentlemen-geeky: did you beat him up and drink beer afterwards like a true man?
<Buytoast> damn, they're more obnoxious than a 1st grade recess
<NoctunalBlade> i wanna be a part of this :D
<gentlemen-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: yes for he has insolted my honor
<twilight_sprinkle> gentlemen-geeky: good, yay for manliness. as my old P.E. teacher used to say, man is derived from the word manliness!
<Buytoast> then again, at least they aren't those people that were ruining people's club photos by forcing horses into the background
<Buytoast> now those guys were dicks
<Mozdoc> Unless this guy owns that unicycle, I can only see pain and suffering in someones future...
<gentlemen-geeky> twilight_sprinkle: yes on the feild of manly combat

<Canadian_Brony> ohai Sumi
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: How long is this video?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,028 minutes 25 seconds :)
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You survived O-O
<twilight_sprinkle> cant imagine most meetups consisting of unicylce riding in the winter though
<AJIsAwesome> DaringDerpy: Meh. I'd go to meetups, but not like these.
<Buytoast> i died a long time ago
<DaringDerpy2> again!
<AJIsAwesome> 2/10, would not eat.
<twilight_sprinkle> tbh id be fun going to a meetup like this too,even if it would get a little awkward
<DaringDerpy2> AJIsAwesome: there are others?
<Buytoast> if you're going to act like that, at least do it in someone's house or something
<gentlemen-geeky> NewSuperBronyU: cold you show two men fighting manly combat on a field of honor
<AJIsAwesome> Plus, I'm PRETTY sure all meetups aren't like this. :S
<Buytoast> don't disturb people trying to eat a big mac
<DaringDerpy2> here on bronystate, they show only the awkward ones
<Buytoast> goddamn
<twilight_sprinkle> big macs r srs bsns
<AJIsAwesome> http://rustledmyjimmies.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MY-JIMMIES-REMAIN-UNRUSTLED.jpg
<Buytoast> i wonder how annoyed the other people in the bowling lanes were
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: lol thats new
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: :P
<twilight_sprinkle> meetups are always loud though
<Buytoast> can you imagine bringing your small child out for a round of family bowling, only to have to be next to a group of 16-30 year old men with neckbeards and gangly arms hugging and jumping around about horses on a screen?
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: "At the convention!"
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: the convention at least confined the bronies to a place :P
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: What's wrong with expanding on being childly? :P
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02gentlemen-geeky: O-o
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: eh nothing, as long as its civil
<twilight_sprinkle> its still better than getting hammered
<gentlemen-geeky> NewSuperBronyU: yes good sir
<sub06905> :3
<AJIsAwesome> Meh, I still wouldn't be shocked. People are weird like that.
<DaringDerpy2> no one really needs to know that I'm a brony. I don't even like the label. some people know that I watch ponies, but I would never sing this loud on the street or something like that
<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: "One, two three four..."
<NoctunalBlade> daaaaaaw, its too adorable
<AJIsAwesome> In fact, everyone's weird.
<sub06905> NewSuperBronyU: have you seen seal 3?
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 :3
<twilight_sprinkle> at least they arent drunk, when a meetup gets drunk, thats when things go to hell
<Vordox> NewSuperBronyU: "Compaaanyyyy!"
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, THAT's when things can get very hectic.
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: If people are drunk at convention here, they'll be tossed out faster then they even notice.
<DaringDerpy2> "I don't know these people!"
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: yeah and i dont drink, which is why i dont want to end up in a drunk company
<DuskStarshimmer> NewSuperBronyU, you have some weird fetishes o.O

<JRP> NINTENDO GIVE RETRO STUDIOS THE METROID LICENCING AND BUILD OFF THE SAME GAME ENGINE OR RECIVE REALLY ANGRY LETTERS
<JRP> huf

<MadSurge> Hello NinjazzMobile :3
<NinjazzMobile> Hey hey hey.
<gentlemen-geeky> JRP: classes sprort
<TheRandomkid321> Well I say I ahve never met a brony so rude in my life.
<TheRandomkid321> Ah superbrony.
<gentlemen-geeky> TheRainbowDawn: you have no honor
<MadSurge> NinjazzMobile: can you click chat linksfrom your mobile?
<NinjazzMobile> I think so... BUT id like to save the images onto my laptop.
*gentlemen-geeky sips tea
<TheRandomkid321> ell quiet chat...
<Kencolt> gentlemen-geeky: I am forced to wonder... You constant harping on honor. It seems your honor is a small, insecure thing, taking offense at any percieved slight, and assuming that all senses of honor must match yours. It brings into question the nature of this honor.
<TheRandomkid321> *well
<MadSurge> NinjazzMobile: k then, I'll wait for you to be on your laptop :)
<MadSurge> NinjazzMobile: have you been busy lately?
<NinjazzMobile> Ty Surge.
<NinjazzMobile> Oh so very.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'm a rude brony? :<
<NinjazzMobile> And between me3 mp and other things, its hard finding time to come online.
<TheRandomkid321> Kencolt You may have a view of honour but that doesn't ean everyone will see eye to eye to you. ALthough saying this I cannot call someones view of honour incorrect without being a hypocrite.
<TheRandomkid321> NewSuperBronyU No not you.
<gentlemen-geeky> Kencolt: ah finly anuthe gentelmen my honor is not small good sir i have a good seanes of honor and i welll defend it and uthers to the death
<TheRandomkid321> Someone on youtube.
<NinjazzMobile> SB, you're kidding right? You're far from rude. FAR.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You'd be surprised :(
<NinjazzMobile> I really would.
<gentlemen-geeky> NewSuperBronyU: your are a spiting exsample of gentelmenship
<Kencolt> gentlemen-geeky: One sign of a proper gentleman is not to constantly question other's honor at any provocation. A TRUE gentleman forbids such action, and only the most egregious of offenses would be cause for such a declaration, But, I can forgive this because of relative youth.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02i liek gentlemenshipness :3c
<Vivix> Everyone's got a tiny bitch inside them that roots for the rudeness~~
<MadSurge> I can be pretty rude too :| but NewSuperBronyU is a nice guy :$
*Vivix yaps quietly
*NewSuperBronyU hugs MadSurge ;A;
<MadSurge> Vivix: yep
<Kencolt> And as many here will tell youm,when I speak of youth, I MEAN it. :$
<TheRandomkid321> I want to talk to Flyboy.
<NinjazzMobile> Aaaaaah grandpaps. Don't feel like that.
<gentlemen-geeky> Kencolt: aye you are right sir but some times honor can only be defened on up held on the feld of combat
<Kencolt> NinjazzMobile: Thing is... I COULD theortically be your grandfather.
<TheRandomkid321> Kencolt how old are you?
<Kencolt> 55 come November.
*TheRandomkid321 spits out tea
<taoumi> more demos? well it's better then nothing i supose
<NinjazzMobile> Well, theoretically yes.
<TheRandomkid321> I say you're older than I thought.
<Kencolt> Yes. Even we olf guys can be bronies.
<NinjazzMobile> But both sides are 60 and above.
<TheRandomkid321> Kencolt think about it. Some people your age cannot even turn on a computer.
<Kencolt> TheRandomkid321: I know. Mom can, however-- does quite well. SHe likes to keep an eye on everyone's finances.
<NinjazzMobile> Lol.
<NinjazzMobile> Not /too/ suprised to see an older brony really.
<NinjazzMobile> Not common but shows the power of the show.
<flufflepuff> I'm sorry but I'm just so underwhelmed by the Wii U
<Vivix> considering the age of internet and computers, me neither~ Fun though, tosee it represented
<Hat> Wii Underwhelm?
<Kencolt> But I am something of the black sheep of the family-- theeldest son who, instead of becoming a "normal" member of society is instead, a gamer, anime fan, and brony. (The last of which is the least remarked on, actually)
<TheRandomkid321> Call me old but. I won't get the Wii U. The idea of a wireless touchscreen controller scares me..
<TheRandomkid321> DAT SWEET FILLY ASS!
<Vivix> Those two lines after eachother
<gentlemen-geeky> Kencolt: how u come acrost suche a fnadum and show may i ask
<NinjazzMobile> If I was in your shoes sire kencolt, wouldn't have it any other way.
<Kencolt> gentlemen-geeky: I mefrely heard things, decided to investigate it, and was pleased with what I found.
<Kencolt> As for anime, and gaming, well, been at that nearly 30+ years.
<flufflepuff> carrots ?
<gentlemen-geeky> Kencolt: ah
<Hat> I think of normality as popular because of its compatibility socially and in work and education, but if you are unafraid to forgo that ease then there are many more worlds to be a part of
<Kencolt> Back in the early days of Western anime fandom, well... No pro subs, no real dubs, god save you from Battle of the Planets (what that did to Gatchaman) and fansubs...
<gentlemen-geeky> Kencolt: i love Battle of the Planets
<Kencolt> Well, the PC had no video capability then, so what was used was raw third hand VHS tapes and 5000 dollar standalone subbing machines that entire video clubs chipped in to buy.
<Vivix> Niice
<Kencolt> gentlemen-geeky: Once you see the original, you become horrified at what Sandy Frank did. Then again I tend to be horrified at ANYTHING Sandy Frank did.
<gentlemen-geeky> Kencolt: i might look it up
<Canadian_Brony> Holy shit I'm still here.
<Canadian_Brony> Hi!
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Canadian_Brony :P
<gentlemen-geeky> Canadian_Brony: welcome back to life friend
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02How is quality? o.o
<Vivix> Open EQD, get DryNites (For children who wet their bed!) ad
<Vivix> be confused
<gentlemen-geeky> NewSuperBronyU: grate sir
<Canadian_Brony> gentlemen-geeky life? Bro, I just finished reading (legit) a good Human-in-Equestria story.
<Canadian_Brony> NewSuperBronyU tis pretty good.
<flufflepuff> Numbers! Those are strictly forbidden in Ponyville... >_>
<DeadpoolDash> quality looks good
<gentlemen-geeky> Canadian_Brony: ah
<Polydunami|LOST> Oh please, don't remind me about the numbers :S
<gentlemen-geeky> tis a shame but i have to leve and during a good ep to well im go night all
<Canadian_Brony> hey
<Canadian_Brony> hey Polydunami
<Canadian_Brony> 1234156156412301534
<Polydunami> I'm up to the eleventh episode of LOST and it's... a thing.
<gentlemen-geeky> night all
<Canadian_Brony> g'night gentlemen-geeky
<Vivix> Wiggle
<gentlemen-geeky> Canadian_Brony: night
<Canadian_Brony> Who is worse: Trixie or Diamon Tiara?
*Vivix likes both
<Canadian_Brony> :O
<Vivix> <.<
<Polydunami> I prefer character development, tbh
<Vivix> I wouldn't HANG with Tiara or Spoon, but I like them-
<Polydunami> I bet you'd like Sawyer :P
<Vivix> Actually, I didn't-
<Vivix> Well, he was okay- I liked hurley
<Polydunami> Actually, I like Hurley. And Sayid
<DeadpoolDash> MOAR APPLES!!!
<Vivix> Yeah
*Canadian_Brony noms on an apple
<Vivix> Fine Art
<flufflepuff> I'm an american
<DeadpoolDash> berry punch scared
<Vivix> Such a terrible salesmare
<Canadian_Brony> they have credit cards?
<Polydunami> I'm a metro. I live in Metro Vancouver :3
<Vivix> I also really like Lyra and Bon bon the way they've been shown in the show up til now
<Vivix> Young, femenine, a litttlee bitchy, and--fun
<Canadian_Brony> sounds like my sister
<Polydunami> And do they have their own personalities apart from ones created by the fans?
<Vivix> Kind of, glimpses. Iron Will episode, eh Fameous fluttershy episode- Wedding episode(Maybe canon for Lyra, not sure)
<flufflepuff> What a nice plot, Twist.
<Vivix> and just twisting their bg appearances
<Polydunami> I remember when Lyra first spoke; the chat exploded
<Vivix> Hehehe
<AdamTheDuck> Dat face :'(
<Vivix> I didn't see the chat at the time, but I was like D=!!
<Vivix> but yeah, I like that personality, I like fanon too, but I think the glimpses we saw in the show are a bit more interesting
<Kencolt> I have to say, MLP doesn't actually have "character development" so much as already well developed characters that do learn and evolve-- but still stay the same at core. Which I like a lot.
<Canadian_Brony> How does a pony learn, let alone master, a martial art?
<Polydunami> They have their ways
<flufflepuff> Sooo, Applebloom sucks at everything?
<Kencolt> These are not characters that need to learn a great, life-changing lession-- they are fine as they are. That's kind of the point.
<Vivix> Yeah, they--stay true to their personalities, but learn from their mistakes in a pretty natural way. Look at how... RD's relationship to Fluttershy changed after the Dragonshy episode. Especially in Hurricane episode
<Vivix> She still gets annoyed, but she reins it in
<Kencolt> Canadian_Brony: You know, one of the announcers for Deathbattle asked the same thing in the Rainbow Dash vs Starscream episode.
<Canadian_Brony> Kencolt so THAT's why it sounds familiar!
<Canadian_Brony> k thx
<flufflepuff> cupcakes with a Dash of Rainbow
<Kencolt> Actually, a Lemon Cupcake would take a bit of sour and some zest.
<Canadian_Brony> -__-
<Vivix> Ooooow, damnit Applebloom, my tongue hurts in sympathy now
<Canadian_Brony> I burnt my tongue last week.
<Canadian_Brony> My food still tastes like rubber.
<Vivix> Aww
<Canadian_Brony> I know, it sucks
<Canadian_Brony> better than having it frozen to a pole
<Vivix> Hehe, true
<MadSurge> Who's streaming?
<Vivix> Poor Twilight

<MadSurge> "3
<Polydunami> Oddly enough, Diamond Tiara does get outshone by Applebloom
<Vivix> Aw yeah, that's cuter too

<flufflepuff> trampstamps
<Vivix> Poor silver
<Canadian_Brony> DeadpoolDash not Scootaloo, the mod Scoot-Scootaloo.
<Vivix> Ignoored by her only friend
<DeadpoolDash> oh
<Canadian_Brony> he's MLG
<Canadian_Brony> so yeah
<flufflepuff> Her idea is better
<MadSurge> Cutie Mark Acquisition Program.
<DeadpoolDash> the free masons
<Polydunami> Oh wow, this is quite familiar of a fanfic I read recently.
<Kencolt> And thus did the eventual doom of Equestria was forged.
<Vivix> Twist, butting in
<Canadian_Brony> We could make a secret society, and the only way others can join is if they were funny hats! *puts on a funny hat and chuckles*
<MadSurge> Self-made cutie mark
<Polydunami> I mean, the secret society part. I've seen that in a fanfic I've read recently.
<Polydunami> Well, more like secret organisation of bureaucracy
<Vivix> Oh?
<MadSurge> Um
<Canadian_Brony> wha

<The_Engineer> I <3 Chikorita
<Moopy> so whats going on here phase4?
<Phase4> it was :3
<Phase4> Gold_Demona, Moopy: i is experimenting
<Moopy> ok
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Super Mario World too :3
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Oh yes, Mario World was awesome! It ties with Mario 3
<The_Engineer> I WANT TO BE THE VERY BEST
<The_Engineer> LIKE NO ONE EVER WAS
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: only complaint? too easy :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: If you say so. :P
<The_Engineer> Watcha doin in xp mode
<Vivix> Or wait, Phase4, site-title id refers to the <h1> tag, <hgroup> has no id
<Phase4> o_O
<Phase4> Vivix, wasnt the id on...
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: but then again, I think Ghouls 'n' Ghosts is a balanced game :D
<Phase4> oh wait, yeah
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: .....SERIOUSLY? o_o
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I've never played it, but I know I'd die in the first level easily.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Ghosts 'n' Goblins though, that was insane.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Wait... What? Which one's the one with the knight that loses his armor when he gets hit?
<The_Engineer> Saving pokemon just incase it breaks again
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Ghouls 'n' Ghosts is the second game of the series
<The_Engineer> Does anyone know castle crashers?
<Gold_Demona> The_Engineer: I've heard the title before, but I'm not really familiar with the game.
<The_Engineer> Check out the gameplay :D
<Starchaser> i just got the hot topic derpy for $50au + shipping
*Gold_Demona is jealous of Starchaser
<Spectrum_Rush> lucky sonava
<MadSurge> Starchaser: ENVYYYY
<The_Engineer> I have a twilight pony doll from mc donalds and it kinda looks like berrypunch with twlights hair
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Gold_Demona> I wish I had a derpy
<Starchaser> one was 4100
<Starchaser> 100$
<The_Engineer> TAKE THAT RATATATA
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the series is actually Ghosts 'n' Goblins, Ghouls 'n' Ghosts, Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts and Ultimate Ghosts 'n' Goblins :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sing my song and become nothing.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I've heard of Ghouls n Ghosts and Super Ghouls n Ghosts. I'm pretty sure those are the ones I'm thinking of that's ridiculously difficult and you only have two hits to live.
<Phase4> wow
<Gold_Demona> Run on sentence of doom. XD
<Phase4> ie 9 screws the page up horribly
<Vivix> Hm-
<The_Engineer> xD
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut :D
<Vivix> no css3 stuff, right?
<The_Engineer> White girls with asian guys
<Gold_Demona> Oh so THAT'S the Asian Women I've heard mentioned on here. XD
<Phase4> what is the command again
<Moopy> i got the same thing on here to
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the first three are like that. Only the last game has actual armor hitpoints
<Vivix> For?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I see. You must be some super madskill'd gamer then. :D
<Moopy> what are you trying to do phase4?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: in the second and last game though you can shoot also above and below you, and the third and last game have a double jump
<Phase4> Moopy, get this vm to talk to the webserver on my laptop
<Moopy> Gee that sucks
<Phase4> ah well
<Starchaser> i cantwait for season 3 to start all the chat spam
<Moopy> eeyup
<The_Engineer> MUD SPORT IS FAILING ON ME
<Phase4> oh thats right
<Phase4> we have cloudflare
<The_Engineer> NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Phase4> cant do a live demo for you guys
<Gold_Demona> I never use the sport moves...
<Gold_Demona> I find them pointless
<The_Engineer> I'm fighting a electric pokemon
<The_Engineer> i need it
*Vivix had to google Cloudflare
<Moopy> i can't wait untill i get 2 of my games coming out
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the last game is actually very accessible. You have actual hitpoints, lifes are easy to come across, you restart from where you died, and you have a variety of shields to block enemy projectiles with
<taoumi> ok machined the two halfs of the mane....now i can go to sleep happy
<Gold_Demona> The_Engineer: Don't have a ground type?
<The_Engineer> I do?
<Gold_Demona> Ground types are immune to electricity
<The_Engineer> I have a Onix a Pidgey and Chikorita
<Phase4> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51948537/img/banner3.png
<The_Engineer> I still need to get ratata
<Gold_Demona> Use the onix on the electric types
<Gold_Demona> Onix laughs at electric moves
<The_Engineer> I am
<The_Engineer> But it gets paralyze
<The_Engineer> Paralyzed*
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: of course, there's also a ton of things that hate you and bottomless pits. Also, the true final boss can be accessed only by collecting hidden golden rings :D
<Vivix> Looks pretty good
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: heh, I don't think I'd survive. I'm not nearly the gamer I used to be. :D
<Moopy> hey phase4 with all that stuff your doing it looks like your doing the hacking stuff
<Phase4> XD
<Gold_Demona> The_Engineer: Paralyze heals and berries.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: my platformer skills are up the task! :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/291/e/c/tropicalgif_by_1n33d4hug-d5i5qw8.gif
<Phase4> XD
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL, obviously. :D
<Gold_Demona> dem dancing ponies
<TheRandomkid321> FINISH THE INCREDIBLE EASY MAZE AND GET AN IPHONE!? OH BOY! WHAT COULD GO WRONG!?!!!?!
<Vivix> Ah 3d inspect, had me entertained for quite a while
<Gold_Demona> :O
<Moopy> thats pretty cool phase4
<Spectrum_Rush> love that animation CrimsonPhoenix
<Phase4> Moopy, its in every firefox install after 14 :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Spectrum_Rush, it's cuter with the music
<Moopy> i see
<Vivix> Can be good to see whether or not you messed up your containers
<Moopy> thats badaas
<Moopy> i mean ass
<Vivix> Is it displaying two banners or is that an artifact?
<The_Engineer> Guys do you think I should let my chikorita evolve or not evolve?
<Gold_Demona> yes
<The_Engineer> What do you mean by yes?
<Gold_Demona> Let it evolve
<Gold_Demona> Better stats
<The_Engineer> Screw that I aint letting it evolve
<The_Engineer> its cute
<Gold_Demona> A'ight
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Is there any point to not letting mons evolve?
<DerpyMuffins> So who is streaming?
<Phase4> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcYiFDgRdFk&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&feature=plcp
<The_Engineer> Phase4
<Moopy> phase4 is
<Phase4> ohai DerpyMuffins
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DerpyMuffins
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: The only benefit to not letting a pok?mon evolve is that they learn their moves faster.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Other than that, no benefit at all.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: then nope, bigger and stronger.
<TheRandomkid321> I'm writing a clip for a short comedy video... I have a slight idea of what I want. It to open on me and a friend playing a game of chess. My friend then movie a peice and saying "check mate" then me looking at him. Then the chess board and flipping the chess boad making the peices fly everywhere... where to go from there... where to go...
<Phase4> this music is beautifull
<The_Engineer> What?
<The_Engineer> Grammar pwease
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: unless they learn useful moves for mons evolved with an item, that is
<TheRandomkid321> The_Engineer typed in a hurry sorry.
<The_Engineer> FAFASFSAFSFAFASFASFSA
<The_Engineer> And there goes onix
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I've been with this site for little over a year now o.o
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: There are only a couple of species that learn something different if they don't involves, but more often than not in those cases, the evolved form learns better moves.
<Phase4> TheRandomkid321, how about "another game?" or something along those lines
<Lasharus> Surprising thought, isn't it NewSuperBronyU?
<Gold_Demona> Ugh, typing fail. "If they don't evolve" I mean
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Yesh o3o
<TheRandomkid321> hase4 I want that to just be the opening not the whole plot.
<Phase4> ah
<Lasharus> I know exactly how you feel. I think I've been here for over a year now as well. :P
<The_Engineer> Hey
<Vivix> I will have soon
<The_Engineer> Phase4
<TheRandomkid321> I've been here for almost a year.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yeah, I mean the mons that evolve with stones and that once they evolved they can't learn other moves
<Ninjazz> 6-7 months.
<Phase4> ?
<The_Engineer> How do you keep brony state chat up even though you're playing tf2
<Ninjazz> Feels like a year.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz! :$
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, those I can understand not evolving until later.
<Ninjazz> Ohai MadSurge.
<Lasharus> The_Engineer: Dual screen setup works wonders for me there. :P
*AdamTheDuck licks Ninjazz :3
<Ninjazz> Much much much easier to typing on a keyboard.
<Phase4> The_Engineer, borderless window
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: There are exceptions to that too. Like Eevee. You want to evolve that critter EARLY
<AdamTheDuck> The_Engineer, borderless windowed
<Phase4> its like fullscreen but alt tab works
<The_Engineer> I mean
<Ninjazz> o u Adam. Still licking people.
<The_Engineer> I ant to keep it open
<The_Engineer> Like
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02And here I thought, 'Would I really still be with this site this time next year?'
<The_Engineer> chat still on the side even though i click on tf2
<Lasharus> Then try dual screen. :P
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The answer was yesh :3
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: so it learns more moves of its evolved type?
<Lasharus> Same here NewSuperBronyU. :P
<AdamTheDuck> The_Engineer, open TF2 in windowed mode then
*NewSuperBronyU noms on Lasharus
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah
<Lasharus> Oy.
<Lasharus> I just had this suit cleaned.
<The_Engineer> I dont want it windowed
<Ninjazz> I'm not so much on the /site/ but I'm on chat.
<Phase4> The_Engineer, it looks the same as fullscreen
<Ninjazz> Since I STILL can't watch the damn stream.
<Lasharus> Then you're not going to be able to use IRC and TF2 at the same time.
<The_Engineer> I mean border windowed
<The_Engineer> not windowed
<Lasharus> It's a game of give and take.
<The_Engineer> POOTIS
<The_Engineer> And there goes pokemon
<The_Engineer> dieing
<TheRandomkid321> ADAAAM!
<DerpyMuffins> Is Phase4 skiing?
<The_Engineer> its surfing
<Phase4> surfing

<AdamTheDuck> Ohai TheRandomkid321 :P
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Ski Free?

*TheRandomkid321 puts on lick protection gear
<Gold_Demona> NewSuperBronyU: NO! Not Skii Free! Anything but Skii Free! o_o

*TheRandomkid321 snaps fingers!
<Lasharus> NewSuperBronyU|Zzz, your nocturnal perseverance has earned you a hidden gaming tip: GO TO BED.

<Gold_Demona> Imma go make me some breakfast. brb
<AdamTheDuck> Dat Phase disconnection
<DerpyMuffins> Speaking of which
<Phase4> interderps
<TheRandomkid321> I shall make there be a knock on the door and when it is answered it's my friend wearing different clothing... I won't spoil it here it'll be on youtube soon enough.
<DerpyMuffins> I need some lunch
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheRandomkid321, that's not Disney
<taoumi> wellp. good night everypony
<TheRandomkid321> CrimsonPheonix I don't get it.
<DerpyMuffins> Cya taoumi
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight taoumi
<CrimsonPhoenix> that picture you put there lies
<The_Engineer> Well everybody
<The_Engineer> I'm off for some GW2
<The_Engineer> Bye everybody
<AdamTheDuck> Bye The_Engineer, have fun.
<Phase4> stupid servers
<Phase4> they got reset at some point
<DerpyMuffins> Cya The_Engineer
<Phase4> and no one fixed
<The_Engineer> WAIT
<NewSuperBronyU|Zzz> 11,02Lasharus: Dungeon Keeper 2 o.o
<The_Engineer> before I go
<The_Engineer> Phase
<The_Engineer> Is that a genuine balloonicorn?
<The_Engineer> wait a sec..I WANNA JOIN IN THE TF2 SERVER
<DerpyMuffins> I still need to download TF2
<The_Engineer> Anyone know the ip?
<Ninjazz> ....wait WUT. DUNGEON KEEPER 2?!
<Ninjazz> LOVE THAT GAME.
<AdamTheDuck> The_Engineer, 203.26.94.80:27015
<LightTrooper105> im back o.o
<The_Engineer> INCOMING!
<The_Engineer> ITS COWARD KILLING TIME
<The_Engineer> HAHAHAHAHHAHA
<LightTrooper105> ok..
<Vivix> Like ice-skating and hitting gravel
<LightTrooper105> lol
<TheRandomkid321> If I was american I would vote for obama. He supports gay rights ^_^. I personally am not a homosexual but I don't mind those who are.
*Ninjazz doesn't care either way.
*Vivix isn't american
*LightTrooper105 dosnt give a dam
<Vivix> If I were, I probably wouldn't vote
<Ninjazz> I am American. Way I see it, we're still screwed.
<Phase4> ohai DashWithRainbows
*DerpyMuffins is confused by american politics
<Vivix> Damned if you do, damned if you don't
<Ninjazz> Zactly.
<Vivix> We've got 6 parties to vote for, like main, instead of ..2+thirdparty
<Phase4> DashWithRainbows, PING
<Vivix> but it still feels like voting for 2 parties saying the same thing
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, turrent at spawn >.>
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, got it
<LightTrooper105> ahh camper..
<Phase4> red team is nothing but campers
<Phase4> its anoying
<Ninjazz> I hate turtle engies.
<Ninjazz> I always went combat engie though.
<Phase4> Ninjazz, the best engi si turtle engi than can work as combat
*DerpyMuffins wants to download TF2, but is too lazy to
<TheRandomkid321> Cat's don't meow to communicate with cats... they do it to communicate with humans.... woah...
<LightTrooper105> so they communicate with their minds? O_O
<JRP|laptop> Phase4: go sleepies now
<Ninjazz> Phase4, I have yet to see that work effectively. I've tried. Using that shotgun that uses scrap as ammo, putting down a turret and dispenser down on a choke point but running around patrolling with the team.
<Ninjazz> Mini sentries, btw.
<The_Engineer> I am coming now
<The_Engineer> I was busy
<The_Engineer> getting food
<Phase4> Ninjazz, you can use the wrench that increases build speed
<Ninjazz> Phase4, I like having not to focus on the building at all and more so on the combat works best for me. Also, I can't even stay still on one spot easily.
<DeadpoolDash> I'd join, but these maps seem like a PITA
<CrimsonPhoenix> that song
<CrimsonPhoenix> what's that song?
<Phase4> solved the spawncamping AND the spawn timer
<Phase4> i solve practial problems
<CrimsonPhoenix> if I'm right this is notacleverpony
*AdamTheDuck suddenly imagines Phase4 bulding a button that sets off a nuke to the blue team
<Phase4> XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, what's the tune playing right now?
<Phase4> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NbyUtARW6I&feature=autoplay&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&playnext=7
<Nick_Scratch|Music> Hello
<Dark_Horst> hi
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Nick_Scratch|Music
<RainbowPie> hello every one!
*RainbowPie licks AdamTheDuck
*AdamTheDuck noms RainbowPie "Am I doing it right?"
<XAX> Ninjazz: Stand still in one spot on CSS and it'll only make my job easier
<Ninjazz> Onry if I accidently buy an AWP, XAX.
<RainbowPie> AdamTheDuck, nope :3 theres a special way you have to do it
*CrimsonPhoenix Sing my song and become nothing. Sing my song and become nothing. Sing my song and become nothing.
<XAX> Ninjazz: as much as an AWP seems like quite a noobish weapon, it takes a bit of aim still. I still miss over half my shots.
<Dark_Horst> if you wanna talk about skill sniping, talk about a game with bullet drop and travel time
<DerpyMuffins> Whats with the chorus Phase4?
<Dark_Horst> DerpyMuffins: celestia origins extended battle theme
<Phase4> ?
<Dark_Horst> iz musiks
<Phase4> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PLs7QuwzRc&feature=autoplay&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&playnext=8
<Ninjazz> XAX, I know. As much as an awpfag would like to argue with me that it takes more skill than any other weapon, it actually requires aim. Since I haven't played CSS in like... forever, I'm probably shit with it now. Used to get lucky with it though.
<Ninjazz> But Scout was always more fun to use.
<XAX> scouts noscope for days
<Ninjazz> Yes. Lol.
<XAX> the noscope spread is rather small even when you're moving
<Ninjazz> Suprise the hell out of me every time I get one with a scout. I wasn't used to the concept of getting a headshot with a sniper without using scope.
<Ryunosuke> talking about snipin
<alexxm> hey guys
<Ryunosuke> VS are op snipers now
<Ryunosuke> without the dropoff
<DerpyMuffins> Hai alexxm
<Ninjazz> Depends on which game we talkin' 'bout.
<Ninjazz> Unless you're going to be all high and mighty and bring real sniping in here.
<alexxm> how've you been DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> Alright
<RainbowPie> hey DerpyMuffins
<DerpyMuffins> Hey
<alexxm> what is this stage
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai alexxm
<AdamTheDuck> How are things?
<Gold_Demona> How the heck are ya alexxm?
<alexxm> test
<alexxm> i'm good AdamTheDuck and Gold_Demona you
<AdamTheDuck> Great alexxm, most of the "oh no the exams are near, lets give our students all the assignments so they can't revise" homework is mostly done. :$
<Gold_Demona> Doing good, thanks. I just finished having breakfast. :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> I hate having a job right now
<CrimsonPhoenix> I want to read more of Background Pony D:
<CrimsonPhoenix> ;-;
<Ninjazz> What a nightmare of a fic.
<Ninjazz> 300k words.
*AdamTheDuck sets a comfortable chair with a warm fireplace infront for CrimsonPhoenix
<Ninjazz> And SSAE didn't think he'd be working on it long and people would burn his house down.
<Ninjazz> Hah.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ninjazz, it's still So goddamn epic
<JT> hey guys ^^
<CrimsonPhoenix> and that lenght is nothing in compare to End of Ponies
<AdamTheDuck> Hello JT
<CrimsonPhoenix> but still yeah it's 300k words sure
<alexxm> how are things JT
<JT> They are good
<CrimsonPhoenix> but the story is just soooooooo awesome you forget about the lenght
<Ninjazz> CrimsonPhoenix, don't spoil. I only jumped on when Chapter one came out and couldn't continue because there was other stuff going on. >_>
<JT> Crimson ur talking about griffin the griffin?
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH GOD
<CrimsonPhoenix> Just chapter 1?
<Ninjazz> Mmmmmmhm.
<CrimsonPhoenix> duuuuuude you're missing some epic stuff
<Ponies47> Morning~
<CrimsonPhoenix> I do like
<Ninjazz> Priority has been changed.
<CrimsonPhoenix> 1 chapter each day
*AdamTheDuck licks Ponies47
<JT> Welcome ponies47
<AdamTheDuck> Good morning Ponies47 :P
<JT> Well Its midday here but still good morning XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> and each chapter becomes more amazing than the previous one
<Dovah> pon
<JT> crimson which story are ya talking about?
<Ninjazz> Hmmm. I'll take your word for it. I was just thinking it was gong to be feelsy moment after feelsy moment.
<CrimsonPhoenix> also what I love about Background Pony is that each chapter feels like its own story
<CrimsonPhoenix> There's quite alot of feelzy I admit but you actually get used to it.....like Lyra
<alexxm> whats background pony about
<Ninjazz> Still the fact that each chapter is almost 20k each turns me away somewhat. >_<
<JRP|laptop> Phase4: play doom
<LightTrooper105> wut I miss?
<Ninjazz> 20k words*
<JT> Ninjazz whats the problem with that? :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ninjazz, don't let that get to you, I knpw I felt the same
<JT> I've seen worse
<Ninjazz> JT, no problem. Just I have alot of things to do in a day.
<Ninjazz> Well, I'll certainly be picking it up again soon then, CrimsonPhoenix.
<Phase4> JRP|laptop, no :<
<JRP|laptop> Phase4: quake, duke nukem 3d, crap?
<CrimsonPhoenix> alexxm, Background Pony is about Lyra being stuck in a curse that would make everyone forget about her after a conversation, she cannot prove in any way that she exist and she cannot go too far from Ponyville without freezing from all over her body.
<JT> I've seen that fanfic but I wasn't that intressted
<alexxm> huh sounds intresting CrimsonOhoenix
<CrimsonPhoenix> but the thing doesn't stop just there
<Ninjazz> AAaaaaah spoilers.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lyra does some good deed while stuck in this curse and learn some philosophical aspect on life while doing them
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can't say any thing more without spoiling though so I'll stop for now
<LightTrooper105> o-o...

*AdamTheDuck <3 Avast Octavia's Plot~
<Ponies47> Me hate mornings .-.
<AdamTheDuck> Mornings are nice and peaceful Ponies47 D:
<Gold_Demona> Me too Ponies47
<Gold_Demona> I don't function well during the day
<Ponies47> AdamTheDuck: But I'm sleepy -.-
<Gold_Demona> Me too
<AdamTheDuck> Ponies47, there's a reason why I say "sleep is for the weak", weak having semantically meaning both as an insult or the physically tired.
*AdamTheDuck isn't sure if semantically is even a word >.>
<Gold_Demona> I'm pretty sure it is. :P
*alexxm banishes AdamTheDuck ot the 5th dimesion for his indesivness
<AdamTheDuck> both the semantic meaning of an insult as well as physically tired* that's a better way to word it
<JT> Sleep is for the weak, indeed but if you don't sleep you will become weak
*AdamTheDuck drags alexxm with him
<alexxm> so how does this map work
<JT> So the cycle is complete....
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm, magnets
*alexxm kicks AdamTheDuck off him
<AdamTheDuck> Ponehs \:3/

<Meanwhile> Technically it stopped being morning half an hour ago from my perspective.

<Meanwhile> Look for my coming at first light on the fifth day, at dawn, look to the east.

<Spectrum_Rush> AdamTheDuck: ya forgot the monocle
<Ninjazz> The highlight of the freaking day is when I can just sit down and watch hordes upon hordes of orcs just die.
<Meanwhile> Hark what light through yonder window breaks.
<Ninjazz> To be bored, or not to be bored. That is the question.
*alexxm steals Ninjazz's lungs
<Meanwhile> Flashback to series 1 of Voyager.
<Ninjazz> As long as I get to keep my liver, alexxm, take my kidneys too.
<LightTrooper105> im bored as hell..
<Meanwhile> Tell me about it.
<Gold_Demona> How bored is hell?
<LightTrooper105> i do not know myself.
<LightTrooper105> and that how bored i am.

<Gold_Demona> Didn't they play Slender once?
<Meanwhile> They've been playing a horror game every day of October.
<Ninjazz> Poor fools.
<alexxm> huh that sounds awesome\
<Meanwhile> It's pretty fun, if you appreciate their sense of humour.
<AdamTheDuck> Some October-fitting elevator music :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX5nDlafVEc
<LightTrooper105> wut o-o...
<Gold_Demona> I wouldn't wanna be hearing this on an elevator. o_o
<Gold_Demona> Not that first part anyway
<Meanwhile> If I heard this on an elevator I'd probably assume my death was imminent.
<LightTrooper105> agree
<AdamTheDuck> I wish there was an instrumental version without the lyrics
<LightTrooper105> if I hear that Im gonna think its elevator to hell
<Meanwhile> When it picks up it's like the elevator has stopped on a floor where all the lights are out and there's something following you in the corridor.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Ryunosuke> woah
<Ryunosuke> http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/9618342/Weighty-memento-war-veterans-secret-revealed-after-his-death.html -- forget all your arrow to the knee jokes... this guy had 6 oz of bomb shrapnel in his leg for 60 odd years
<Meanwhile> It just occured to me that I have to take an elevator later and it's one of those ones with mirror walls.
<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, D:
<Spectrum_Rush> godspeed Meanwhile
<Gold_Demona> Holy crap! o_o
<Ninjazz> It's fun looking at the endless reflections, then imagine one of your "yous" would lean towards you and warn you.
<Gold_Demona> How the hell did this man live with that much pointy metal in his flesh?! O_O
<LightTrooper105> o-o...
<Meanwhile> Daaaaamn, that guy was awesome.
<Ryunosuke> umm i dunno?
<Spectrum_Rush> well as they say... war is hell
<Ninjazz> A paradise to some.
<Meanwhile> Gah fuck this video.

*AdamTheDuck gives LightTrooper105 a glass of water .-.
<LightTrooper105> too much spicy..
<Ryunosuke> http://i.imgur.com/YokFX.png -- a picture of rarity :)
*AdamTheDuck knocks LightTrooper105's glass of water out of his hands

<Ninjazz> And then i realized that.
<Ninjazz> Closed that image.
<LightTrooper105> i just notice dat..
<Ninjazz> Not saving.
<LightTrooper105> xDD
<Meanwhile> From adorable to horrifying in two seconds.
<LightTrooper105> ^
<Gold_Demona> ^^
<Ninjazz> ^^^
<Ninjazz> I blame Gold_Demona.
<Meanwhile> Agreed.
<Gold_Demona> :D
<Ninjazz> You just had to enlighten me.
<LightTrooper105> indeed
<Phase4> oh god, Gold_Demona: DAMN YOU
<Gold_Demona> I'm sorry! Next time I'll let everyone stay ignorant! D:
*Phase4 hugs Gold_Demona
<Ninjazz> Ty very much.
*AdamTheDuck noms Gold_Demona
<Meanwhile> I'm generally against ignorance unless it's for the sake of not being horrified by the truth.
<Meanwhile> I can't handle the truth.
<Gold_Demona> Adam, y u noms meh :<
<Meanwhile> Let me live in my glass house of happy.
<Gold_Demona> Hooray for glass house of happy
<Ninjazz> As long as my glass box of emotion doesn't crack.
<Gold_Demona> Don't throw anything heavy
<Gold_Demona> Or eles it'll be broken house of sad. :<
<Gold_Demona> else*
<Meanwhile> I was happy in it until you threw a rock at me entitled "The mini Rarities have no eyes"
<LightTrooper105> well time to play WoT
<Ninjazz> Hard to believe that's all it took.
<Ninjazz> Such a small detail.
<Meanwhile> Then I was showered in the broken glass of exposition and my world crumbled as the horrors of eyeless marshmallow filled my psyche.
<Gold_Demona> I sowwy :<
<Ryunosuke> its stiill good if you dont look at the little stuff :)
<Gold_Demona> lol XD
<Ponies47> Gotta run
<MadSurge> I'm back guys, did I miss something? :D
<Ponies47> Bye
<Gold_Demona> laters Ponies47
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Ponies47
<LightTrooper105> Gold_Demona at least you notice it first
<Ninjazz> But now all I focus on is the small stuff.
<Meanwhile> That's fine, I got enough of a heart attack a minute ago from this Cry of Fear vid.
<LightTrooper105> take care Ponies47
<Ninjazz> Cry of Fear's scares get old fast though, Meanwhile.
<MadSurge> :O dat Rarity image
<Meanwhile> This vid is almost an hour long so I hope you're right.
<AdamTheDuck> Have some relaxing elevator music this time :P http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMiYq2TaYR8
<MadSurge> Someone could make that image with Rarity toys :D
<ShyBetaFemale> AdamTheDuck i love jazz fusion!
<ShyBetaFemale> :P
<AdamTheDuck> Jazz fushion? :$
<Ninjazz> Well I'm assuming it's all highlights so you'll get used to it sooner than later. :p
<AdamTheDuck> sion*
<MadSurge> Ohai ShyBetaFemale!
*AdamTheDuck licks ShyBetaFemale
<Ninjazz> And ShyBetaFemale said the magic word.
<ShyBetaFemale> AdamTheDuck there's a thing about jazz fusion that makes it sound like elevator music :P
<ShyBetaFemale> hey everyone!
<Meanwhile> 'Lo ShyBetaFemale.
<AdamTheDuck> ohai~ :P
<Ryunosuke> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOYtzqswlYg -- when you see it.... :)
<ShyBetaFemale> here AdamTheDuck, jazz fusion http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il8hyQCqJ9A
<ShyBetaFemale> hahaha it sounds like hold music when you're on the phone
<ShyBetaFemale> love it
<AdamTheDuck> May I ask why it's called "fusion"
<ShyBetaFemale> because it incorporates elements of jazz with rock music
<Meanwhile> Ryunosuke: I saw it.
<ShyBetaFemale> jazz fusion is more of an approach than an actual genre, or at least it was when it first came to light
<Ryunosuke> :D
<ShyBetaFemale> during the 70s and such it was kind of like "lets take this weird instrument, and play some extended chords under it during an improvised solo"
<Ryunosuke> at first I was "is that what i think it is?" and when i went back and looked at it... i realized it was what I thought it was
*TheRandomkid321 Licks AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<ShyBetaFemale> awww

<Meanwhile> That was some time ago.
<Ninjazz> I remember when I used to watch TV.
<DerpyMuffins> The good ol' days
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<TheRandomkid321> Ah when it was good I was young... hardly remember it now... all I remember from back then where previes for movie on old VCR tapes....
<DerpyMuffins> I feel sorry for the generation that came after us
<Saturn> 08,01Saturn sempai sama san sama sempai...

<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Writing is SO cool~
<Ninjazz> I was waiting for Uguu uguu.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm writing about the gamification of the learning process
<Saturn> 08,01particularly about teaching computer programming through programmatic logic games
<DerpyMuffins> In english?
<AdamTheDuck> Alright, I think I should hit the hay.
<Saturn> 08,01no, in swahili...
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight everyone~
<Spectrum_Rush> Ego Trip? whos streaming?

<MadSurge> Meanwhile: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/9b094c07b043457478f02cef580292e8.jpg heeheehee :D
<Phase4> Saturn, whats your opinion on that btw?
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Hehehe
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: on what?
<TheRandomkid321> Saturn please answer. What is the required age on bronystate? TELL ME!
<Saturn> 08,01TheRandomkid321: 29
<Phase4> Saturn, gamification of learning
<TheRandomkid321> :|
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: i think it's a wonderful idea
<Saturn> 08,01it's a great way of engaging otherwise unmotivated pupils
<TheRandomkid321> Saturn ... your joking right?
<Kandarihu> Is this what I think it is?
<Ninjazz> kid321 pls go.
<Saturn> 08,01TheRandomkid321: nope, deadly serious. gamification is awesome.
<TheRandomkid321> I mean about the age.
<Kandarihu> Ah, it IS Ego Trip
<Saturn> 08,01what do you think?
<Spectrum_Rush> Kandarihu: if its dexter then yes yes it is
<Phase4> Saturn, i've not seen it in practice but from what i'm hearing most gamification is essentialy the same as achivments in actual computer games
*AdamTheDuck is now curious
<Saturn> 08,01we generally don't enforce an age restriction here
<Kandarihu> But I seem to be having framerate issues.
<AdamTheDuck> What's gamification Saturn? :3
<TheRandomkid321> Satrn I just wanted to be sure. Here tell it's increased to 14 recently?
<Saturn> 08,01but, content on the chat and stream may be unsuitable for those under 14/15
<Phase4> Saturn, i'd love to see it done well though, does sound like a good idea
<Meanwhile> It's more like a warning than a restriction.
<Phase4> Meanwhile, "they're more like guidelines than actual rules"
<Meanwhile> Phase4 is best Keith Richards.
<TheRandomkid321> Saturn I have watched violent movies and played violent games since 7. My parents have been swearing since I was born. I knew about how humans reproduce for as long as I can remember. I tink i'll handle it.
<Phase4> dat dexters lab
<Spectrum_Rush> aslong as you're mature enough to have common sense then age is...
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: teaching by either using games or game elements
<Saturn> 08,01my daddy is home!

<Saturn> 08,01the game i'm using to teach programming is called Manufactoria

<naturesfury> that guy grows and shirks i tell you what
<FreNeS1> YO!
<Phase4> SE
<Phase4> XD'
<Starchaser> hey
<Gold_Demona> :D
<MadSurge> SIQUEWHAT
<Lyra`> oh hell yeah
<Saturn> 08,01dat hoof in the bg
<Lyra`> i love dexters lab
<Kandarihu> Ninjazz, Great and Powerful (guy living in a secluded center of a majestic city) is clearly a reference to the Wizard of Oz.
<Lyra`> who is streaming?
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: probably, i think some of the wrters are the same
<MadSurge> Lyra`: Scoot-Scootaloo
<Gold_Demona> So Dexter got tall and then got back short. :P
<Gold_Demona> Seems legit
<Lyra`> Scoot-Scootaloo, be my husband?
<Saturn> 08,01Lyra`!
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03che?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Nah~
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that's how old people walk :D
<MadSurge> *work
<Lyra`> fine, Scoot-Scootaloo, be a jerk
<Ninjazz> Kandarihu, at this point, it's a not even a legitamate reference to anything. It's just a common phrase.
<Lyra`> see if i care!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: That is one HELL of a slouch. XD
*Lyra` cries
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03:3
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Kandarihu> Ninjazz, good point.
*Saturn 08,01pies Lyra` inna face
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: my brain works in mysterious ways
*Lyra` drips pie goop and tears
<MadSurge> Ewwww
<naturesfury> ?
<Lyra`> where did the stream go?
<Lyra`> sad face!
<Ninjazz> Dat commercial break?
<FreNeS1> ah
<Lyra`> oh yay!
<Kandarihu> Then again, it's pretty much the same joke. Elderly Dexter is effectively Oz (or rather the wayward professor who created the hologram display that Oz was
<Kandarihu> )
<MadSurge> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
<Lyra`> looks like a bomb hit
<alexxm> well the worlds gone to hell
<Lyra`> ahah
<FreNeS1> dat houses
<Ninjazz> Kandarihu, I'll give you that. But I think you'd have to be specific if you want it to be a ref to Oz.
<Starchaser> you know for kids
<Ninjazz> Wow this is worse than Fallout.
<Lyra`> boot on head with big beard :D
<MadSurge> Dem crazy people
<Lyra`> at least fallout had intelegent people
<MadSurge> :D
<Ninjazz> And guns.
<alexxm> dumb bomb?
<Lyra`> goofy <3
<Meanwhile> Welp, places to go people to pretend to listen to, things to get out of the way.
<Meanwhile> See you folks later.
<Ninjazz> And then Dexter just made the tech level jump 10 times.
<Ninjazz> Cya Meanwhile.

<Ninjazz> I canNOT get over how Older Dexter sounds younger than young Dexter.
<Ninjazz> Also, he should have been riding his actual steed.
<Ninjazz> http://i.imgur.com/qwLup.png
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: more whiny, really
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: :D
<MadSurge> DAT MANLINESS
<Kandarihu> So far, we've seen 3 different incarnations of Mandark. and 3 different incarnations of Dexter are meeting a fourth.
<Ninjazz> And the kid grows into ginger Mr. T.
<Gold_Demona> LOL omg I vaguely remember this now XD
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: considering a previous episode :S
<MadSurge> DUN DUN DUUUUUN
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, "previous episode"?
<naturesfury> years he dug?
<MadSurge> Dumbening rays :D
<Kandarihu> Four conveniently sized wrenches
<Ninjazz> He was prepared.
<Phase4> Kandarihu, its almost like some form of time travel was employed
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: http://cdn.static.ovimg.com/episode/268745.jpg like i said
<Kandarihu> Phase4, as if child-Dexter was prepared for this.

<FreNeS1> my science teacher put us a video of this show in class
<FreNeS1> was epic
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: ah, I see
*TheRandomkid321 catches cancer from this show
<Saturn> 08,01Dear Princess Celestia, today i learned that Apple's proposed new HQ design looks like it will house a particle accelerator. Your terrified student, Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01http://landarchs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/apple1.png
<Laurayne> I Like How Back Then Everyone Was Content With Just A Small 3 Second Sign Saying Be Careful When You Mention A Knife... Nowdays That Show Would Be Cancelled lol
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the hologram doctor is great too though :3
<Lasharus> That is a preposterously huge building.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Sadly I have not watched enough Voyager to Make a fair judgement on him. :<
<Sylandest> Saturn: Thats the new Apple HQ? Straight up villainy right there
<Gold_Demona> I've watched every other series though...
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: he's a hologram, but he ain't takin shit either
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ohai Saturn *hugs*
<TheRandomkid321> Slylandest ever since steve jobs dies theya re pure villian are they not?
<Lil_B> Saturn ... this ... isn't seriously their new design ... right? RIGHT?!
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: i think it's fucking awesome, to be honest
<Lasharus> Sylandest, we could install red lights on the roof and turn them on at the same time and go 'look, Apple red-ringed'
<Gold_Demona> My husband and I have been going through a lot of them on Netflix. Currently watching through Next Generation. Will probably endure Voyager after we run out of Next Gen.
<Sylandest> Lasharus: ha!
<Saturn> 08,01it looks like it's going to take off
<Saturn> 08,01or house SCIENCE
<Lasharus> Saturn, it looks bloody preposterous.
<Laurayne> Hey, Im A Firefighter :)
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL, Yeah I know that much about him.
<TheRandomkid321> NO! FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER I WANTED TO SEE ADVERTISMENTS!
<Lasharus> Look at the buildings surrounding it, that thing is bigger than most buildings I've seen in my LIFE.
<Lil_B> Saturn it doesan't look bad, I just think that it is reduculus to build something like this
<Lasharus> That monstrosity is insane.
<Techmarine> Breakmania
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and I like Seven of Nine too :)
<TheRandomkid321> Is bill nye a real scientist?
<shadowboy8456> seven of nine?
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: why?
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Who doesn't like Seven of Nine? :D
<shadowboy8456> i learned a klingon drinking son because of her! I love it!
<shadowboy8456> song
<shadowboy8456> her and the docter were singing
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: best character of that series imo
<shadowboy8456> docter?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I dunno much about the other ST series :D
<Lil_B> Saturn it's freaking Huge, and has a lot of wasted Pace in the middle, it also looks a bit... whats the word...
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I honestly can't pick a favorite since I'm not familiar with the whole cast. I know their names and faces and generally what they do, but that's as far as it goes.
<Gold_Demona> <adSurge: All I know is Janeway's a sucky captain. :P
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge*
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: that much I got it too :D
<shadowboy8456> I personally liek Janeway...may it's her voice...or the fact that she got Q to fall for her
<shadowboy8456> maybe
<Lil_B> Saturn arrogant, that's the word I was löooking for
<TheRandomkid321> MAKE THIS TORTURE END!
<Laurayne> ..... This Show Is Too Enthusiastic For me.... o.o;;

<Mega_Milk> I actually appreciate that he gets around to many different topics in the same show. Not just sticking to the same thing for 30 minutes.
<shadowboy8456> probably
<TheRandomkid321> Ys I do believe bill nyw is a scientist.
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Kirk was abducted by Khan and bitchslapped him into submission, Janeway got gunpointed by a few Klingons and she got booted out of her ship without complaining :D
<TheRandomkid321> UUnlike this idiot.
<Lil_B> awell, you can also just use Oxygen as your fuel :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: the doctor and a minor character had to save their sorry asses!
