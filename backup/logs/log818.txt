<BaconMane> 0,5Wat?
<MadSurge> But I like fiddle songs D:
<Saturn> 08,01Dark92Enigma: for it not to be a vapid word-repeating childish jaunt
<Dark92Enigma> BaconMane: hi!
<BaconMane> 0,5I didn't say anything >_>
<Dark92Enigma> BaconMane: ok ;)
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: it was less than half-arsed
<Saturn> 08,01it was quarter-arsed
<Saturn> 08,01and that's being generous.
<Saturn> 08,01except the fiddle in it
<Saturn> 08,01that was cool.
<JRP2234> https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6900657408/h677F2741/ how i see the moon
<Bronysith> Dark92Enigma: it was just this "raise this barn, raise this barn, 1 2 3 4, raise this barn"
<Bronysith> thats the whole song
<jcelios> maybe it was infinitesimally-arsed
<Saturn> 08,01to be fair, the fiddle was awesome
<JRP2234> Saturn theere rebooting rott
<Saturn> 08,01and not many other kids' cartoons will actually have a real fiddle in a song
<Nittany_Discord> jcelios: It's a symbol for a thunderstorm. One with hail.
<JRP2234> they got the same devs and everything
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith ok, point taken. :S
<Dark92Enigma> i admit it
<Bronysith> Saturn: it just goes to show that the studio doesnt care at all for applejack
<Saturn> 08,01JRP2234: a nice thought, but i'll bet you the new one will be rubbish; i just have visions of DNF all over again...
<jcelios> Nittany_Discord: interesting, is there some kind of name for these symbols that I can google?
<Bronysith> Saturn: please dont bring that game into this
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: i'll bring anything into anything
<Serenity> Hey everypony
*Saturn 08,01brings a lion into a bar
<JRP2234> Saturn its got everyone who worked on the original
*Serenity slaps Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01the barman says "you can't leave that lion there"
*Bronysith eats the lion that Saturn brought
<rcman914> so is it just random images right now
<JRP2234> Saturn do you want to stream?
<Saturn> 08,01and i say, "that's not a lion, it's a giraffe"
<Saturn> 08,01and the barman says "you're in the wrong joke, mate"
<thelonepony> Ohai there Saturn :)
<Saturn> 08,01so i take the lion, and try to find the correct joke
<Saturn> 08,01we set out on an epic quest, through the metaverse of humour
<Saturn> 08,01we run into many foes and tribulations along the way
<Bronysith> Saturn: somehow TNG theme goes fittingly well with this
<RaveBrony> Oh hey, Saturn! :)
<Saturn> 08,01but also make new friends
<rcman914> so are we just showing a slide show right now?
<Dark92Enigma> Saturn: the possibilities are endless
<Nittany_Discord> jcelios: http://tornado.sfsu.edu/geosciences/classes/m201/WeatherMapAnalysis/wxmap.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01though we end up back home eventually, the journey has changed us, and we will never be the same, innocent and inexperienced children we once were
<Saturn> 08,01*ba dum tsh*
<Bronysith> Saturn: best joke ever
<cowvarkian> true
<jcelios> rcman914: yup
*Saturn 08,01has the best extended metaphors
<CriticKitten> Welp. Off to my parents' place for a few days. If I don't come back, it's safe to presume the flu finally got me. Otherwise I'll see y'all near the end of the week.

<Deacon> cachi01 slowpoke
<cachi01> Deacon pls i was the 3rd to comment on the ign trailer
<cachi01> lel
<Bronysith> anyways, The only games ill be playing on my vita are, persona 4 golden, Final fantasy 6-8 and chrono trigger when i buy it
<jcelios> Bronysith: good man
<Bronysith> and Legend of dragoon if its playable on it
<cowvarkian> Bronysith: its square enix, of course they're milking it
<Bronysith> jcelios: so far, i dont like final fantasy 8 as much as 7 or 6
<jcelios> Bronysith: its way different
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: yea, i miss square soft T~T
<Bronysith> jcelios: the magic system is balls
<Bronysith> HAHAHAHAHA
<cowvarkian> lelwat
<Bronysith> LT Data got stuck in a chinese finger trap
<Bronysith> HAHAHAHAHA
<jcelios> Bronysith: totally, probably the worst square's ever done XD
<cowvarkian> until the next game
<Deacon> was FF8 that bad?
<jcelios> I really like it, but the magic system is bad
<Bronysith> Deacon: the magic system is way different, the story is meh, and the characters arent as likeable as 6 or 7
<Bronysith> ill be honest, people are way too hard on Cloud...even though he does DREAD AND FUCKING ANGST
<Bronysith> i mean Dart Feld pretty much went through the same shit, and even then some, and he doesnt dread or angst
<cowvarkian> those sound like things that would make one hate a character
<Bronysith> in fact he just pulls a kamina and moves on
<Deacon> Bronysith same thing for cecil
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: yea, but cloud did go through a lot of shit and at one point believed his entire life was a lie
<JRP2234> im too tired to finish my song
<Bronysith> Deacon: which final fantasy is that?
<Deacon> 4
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: "Apple Family Reunion": Episode Followup
*cowvarkian has never played a final fantasy game
<texasboykc09> ^
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: final fantasy 7 is a great introductory final fantasy
<JRP2234> go hime prince-dari bot your drunk
<Bronysith> cowvarkian: after you beat that, play final fantasy 6
<Deacon> 5 is also a good start, gameplay wise though
<jcelios> when I was little I thought the gun blade was the most ingenious idea ever... combining a gun and a sword? how awesome is that!? Sigh lol
<cowvarkian> you're making it sound like I'm ever going to play a final fantasy game
<cowvarkian> which I'm not
<Bronysith> Deacon: are 4 and 5 on the PSN?

<DerpyMuffins> hai Ponies47
<Bronysith> cachi01: if only there was a larger library for the vita though....ah well, persona 4 golden makes it worth while
<Bronysith> cause JRPGs are usually great games
<Bronysith> cause you are guarentted at least 100 hours of gameplay, story wise of course
<Deacon> Bronysith though it be better to download ff4 complete, it has the original game with overhauled grafics, and a sequel
<cowvarkian> *graphics
<Bronysith> Deacon: aight
<Bronysith> though i really dont care for graphics, if its 16 bit i love it
<Bronysith> cause 16 bit final fantasy <3
<Deacon> if it's one thing I dread about RPGs, its that I keep picking up more, and never finish any of them
<kidzrul732> I keep thinking today is monday but it's sunday
<Bronysith> Deacon: i recommend persona 3, you wont get RPG syndrome and its only 5 bucks

<scout19_tf2> so why not dis one
<Chrysalis> cachi01: yes but saturn is the exception to any and all thins
<Nittany_Discord> Bronysith is going to stop his RP as well.
<Chrysalis> scout19_tf2: because they are the rules

<Saturn> 08,01i *love* Tolkien's creation myth from the Middle-Earth mythos
<Saturn> 08,01it's so awesome
<Shizuka> 13it was sneezed into existence?
<Chrysalis> "Bronystate is not an RP channel, and as such, excessive Role-Playing is discouraged"
<Saturn> 08,01i'd totally follow that religion, if i was in need of one
<Chrysalis> its in the rules
<cachi01> da rule
<cachi01> z
<matttheshadowman> scout19_tf2: it's there also some rules are obvious and if everything was put there the rules would be so long and boring noone would read them
<Saturn> 08,01Shizuka: the material world was created as a physical manifestation of a song which one of the "angels" had sowed thoughts of discord into
<MadSurge> :O
<Serenity> Go away streme

<cachi01> shizumobile: wat game is dis?
<cachi01> oh synaesthete
<Saturn> 08,01one thing i don't like about the Middle-Earth mythos, is that a lot of it (the bits concerning Sauron) are essentially saying that technology and science are bad
<texasboykc09> im back
<Eulshy> Somethings wrong with yotutube...
<shizumobile> You'll want to up your volume :3
<shizumobile> This music is awesome
<jcelios> Eulshy: nah they just changed the layout :P
<cachi01> jcelios: exactly
<Eulshy> No, whenever I try to watch the nes mlp episode, my player crashes
<Java> Saturn: Well, he wrote it based on his experience in WW2. They use tech for war efforts. So he hate it.
<cachi01> BEN stahp fakin round with bronies
<Eulshy> And it only crashes for the new episode
<Java> Eulshy: There's always something wrong with youtube.
<texasboykc09> shizumobile, what is this game called?
<jcelios> synaesthete
<cachi01> lel notes just liek mario
<jcelios> the lore in this game is batshit
<jcelios> I think I like it
<Eulshy> Java, I checked the video, the ad loaded, on every different one i tried to watch of it, it always crashed as it came it
<cachi01> Eulshy: BEN
<Kandarihu> So, what's this game?
<jcelios> synaesthete
<Eulshy> No clue wtf that is
<cachi01> Kandarihu: synaesthete
<Java> Eulshy: Go get adblock?
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I guess it's not on Steam
<Eulshy> You know, if you don't want to listen you only had to say
*Kipkat07_Scarf parachutes into the chat

<alexxm|colt> sentry down

<cachi01> jkljkjljk
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: wha is homework?
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: im not sure, i think its something on bronystate
<thelonepony> cachi01: I heard it was a hard paper that makes you learn and practice
<cachi01> blasphemy
<thelonepony> ikr
<Java> I just googled this game. It's a Digipen student's game?
<Java> Going to download it.
<Java> Is it okay if I put the download link for this game here?
<cachi01> well i better make a note in my phone called ''cool indie gmes i must download in my new pc''
<thelonepony> cachi01: or write it down in a piece of paper
<cachi01> HAHHAHAHAHAAHHA
<cachi01> nein
<cachi01> dats humwahrck
<thelonepony> cachi01: you might never know that you lost your phone
<Java> I'll put the link mmmkay
<Java> https://www.digipen.edu/?id=1170&proj=383
<jcelios> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<cachi01> thelonepony: o_o
<Java> Those people at Digipen made awesome game ideas.
<thelonepony> cachi01: well, i lose my phone constinly and i find it the next day
<cachi01> oh lol
<cachi01> bahs tiem
<thelonepony> lol, indeed
<Kandarihu> The Voxel King is attacking the stream!
<jcelios> scintillant hues!
<Kandarihu> thelonepony, is there another phone you can use to dial your main phone, like a landline?
<thelonepony> Kandarihu: nope, i said before that i find it the next day
<DerpyMuffins> This looks addictive
<jcelios> its funky beats have got a hold of me!
<cachi01> anypony here has an amazing gaming pc?
<jcelios> 4ish years ago mine was :<
<thelonepony> cachi01: nope
<thelonepony> my computers sucks
<cachi01> its because idk what graphics and how many ramn and what processor i must buy >.<
<cachi01> ram*
<cachi01> i want mah pc to run everything
<cachi01> no lag
<Chrysalis> cachi01: depends on your budget
<cachi01> but i dont want to spend 200 dollars on I7
<Chrysalis> if you have a very large budget, a top end i5/i7
<Chrysalis> for medium range
<Java> cachi01: You can ask someone who know how to build pc in your budget range.
<Chrysalis> go for a AMD Bulldozer
<twilight_sprinkl|mob> Buy a supercomputer cashie, should only cost a few hundred million
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkl|mob: lol

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: (Rumor) Possible Upcoming Episode Title
<cachi01> oh thx Kandarihu :)
<Kandarihu> cachi01, no problem
<Chrysalis> prince-dari: could you PLEASE move that eqd script to a seperate bot
<Chrysalis> so i can ignore it
<Bronysith> oi Chrysalis you hung over?
<Chrysalis> Bronysith: i dont get hangovers
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: good on ya
<cachi01> Kandarihu: i think i'll go for an outstanding thx :)
<cachi01> now i just need to show this to my dad
<Kandarihu> I've got my eyes set on making something akin to a Very Good
<Kandarihu> I hope you can afford all the parts, though.
<Chrysalis> Kandarihu: anyone on about building a serious pc
<Chrysalis> should realise that you should consider money a none object
<Chrysalis> to get a proper rig
<Chrysalis> op op oppan tiger style
<cachi01> yeah outstanding or excellent
<Kandarihu> Chrysalis, I don't have the kind of budget to even build a Destitute class right now. Not unless I'm going to go through super saving mode for several months.
<Chrysalis> seriously your assigning ship classes to desktop rigs?
<Chrysalis> this is an amazing idea
<Chrysalis> dibs on titan class
<Kimori> >.>
<Kandarihu> Chrysalis, what I really want out of my next computer would be more akin to Very Good, but it would work off of a Network Attached Storage device.
<Chrysalis> NAS are generally a pretty good idea
<Chrysalis> large portable storage without actually needing to move it
<Kimori> anyone around
<Kandarihu> So the NAS would just be sitting in some part of the house, and the main box would be in an HTPC on top of my VCR/DVD player.
<Chrysalis> i would definately recommend an SSD as the main drive
<shizumobile> Why did it have to be snakes
<Kipkat07_Scarf> whats a floppy disk?
<jcelios> it kind of bothers me that his tail in outside his suit in ithis D: http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/184/8/c/space_calpain_pony_by_acesential-d55w20q.png
<Afflict> yeah
<jcelios> that can't be healthy
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I know what a floppy disk is Im just joking. Dont hurt me....
<pony_1242> are we live?
*Bronysith takes Kipkat07_Scarf away to slumber
*Kipkat07_Scarf slumbers
<thelonepony> pony_1242: yes
<thelonepony> well, the stream is live
<pony_1242> ok
<thelonepony> :P
<alexxm|colt> does the stream keep bufferingn for anyone
<pony_1242> then why are watching a video game?
<Chrysalis> alexxm|colt: not here
<Kandarihu> jcelios, as long as there isn't a point where internal air pressure isn't contained, it should be okay.
<Chrysalis> pony_1242: becauase that is what is currently streaming
<Michael> hiya everypony :p
<pony_1242> but a video game isnt pony related
<Chrysalis> no
<Chrysalis> we do not stream pony related videos at all time
<Chrysalis> or it would get old
<pony_1242> oh
<shizumobile> Get over it
<Chrysalis> this is bronystate, not ponystate
<pony_1242> so is there anything we can talk about?
<Chrysalis> pretty much anything
<Michael> so... how are you doing all, and what game is that?
<Chrysalis> everything else is in the rules
<Chrysalis> Michael: this is synesthesia
<pony_1242> i know chrysalis
<Michael> Chrysalis: looks good :3

*Bronysith kirby suplexes Everlasting_Joy
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: no problem
<jcelios> AdamTheDuck: sounds gaaaaaaaaaaay
<Lil_B> Guys, have any of you heard that WarZ got pulled of Steam because... well, basicly they lied to everyone?
*Everlasting_Joy vanishes into a start.
<jcelios> Lil_B: yup
<AdamTheDuck> Lil_B, rofl WarZ
<wipergone2> Lil_B: yea
<Michael> lol
<GabeMoist> Lil_B, what happened?
<wipergone2> dayz came first
<Everlasting_Joy> What are we watching?
<Lil_B> well, the Guy behind WarZ was also behind another infamous game
<AdamTheDuck> I knew that game was going to die somehow, but not this bad XD
<GabeMoist> I'unno what WarZ is
<Lil_B> He also worked on "Big Riggs" xD
<rcman914> hello\
<jcelios> GabeMoist: nothing important XD
<GabeMoist> Big Rigs is a swell game
<AdamTheDuck> Hello rcman914
<Chrysalis> warz is incomplete

<GabeMoist> Big Rigs is almost as Good as Superman 64
<rcman914> what is this game?
<Chrysalis> AdamTheDuck: yeah
<Michael> they were selling a incomplete game?
<Vivix> terms and license was a copy paste, and part of the company history was fraudulent, I think
<Chrysalis> it was a pre-release on steam
<wipergone2> warz IS NOT the first zombie mmo
<AdamTheDuck> Chrysalis, ... A lesson for any other developer who wishes to release an unfinished game and "patch it later".
<Chrysalis> AdamTheDuck: minecraft
<Lil_B> Well, to be honest, there have been games before that got sold before they were incoplete on Steam
<Vivix> Stronghold 3
<wipergone2> speed gel
<AdamTheDuck> Chrysalis, I was thinking more like Fallout New Vegas
<Lil_B> But at least they didn't lied to the consumer as WarZ did
<AdamTheDuck> Chrysalis, Minecraft was in beta anyway
<Vivix> FNV worked on launch date to me
<wipergone2> bronies
<Chrysalis> AdamTheDuck: it was sold back in alpha

<wipergone2> u can have 100% refund
<Rocket> Lil_B inception
<Vivix> no, I can't, I didn't buy it on steam
<Vivix> and I didn't feel scammed
*Bronysith suplexes a nuclear Rocket

<Vivix> yes
<Serenity> Unless they hired this team too
<Java> Vivix: yep
<Vivix> Nebacular Drop
<Barbetos> so sticky
<Vivix> that's what the team did before Portal 1, Portal 1 team disbanded a bit before Portal 2, and some of them made some other potal style game
<Everlasting_Joy> Nice stick!
<Vivix> Never tried Nebacular Drop, can't see stream so don't know if that's what's on
<Java> Vivix: Quantum Conundrum right?

<Barb|Lappy> It would bring slacking at work a whole new meaning
<ouo> will you put bacon on the xmass tree?
<Barb|Lappy> lol first comment on that last one. "That's a-drawer-able!"
<Barb|Lappy> XDDDDDD
<Barb|Lappy> I love puns.
<Serenity> Grrr
<Serenity> I hate my laptop
<Serenity> Such a pain in the arse to work
<Rex_Mundi> Anybody here expecting to get pony related merchandise for christmas?
<Serenity> I'm getting money, shit tonnes of money
<Serenity> Which will all go towards a new laptop
<aniderp|bestcakeever> yes yes yes!
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hopefully i am
<aniderp|bestcakeever> <3
<ouo> Luna has hottiest eyes, but, she is best princess :3
<Luna> 07,01was there ever any doubt?
*aniderp|bestcakeever jumps up and down hoping she will get a bunch of pony stuff
<Serenity> I have some pretty hot eyes
<Rex_Mundi> ouo: its hard to tell who is hottest pony, but Luna is deffiniatly top tier
<Serenity> Saturn is hottest pony

<Barb|Lappy> http://i.imgur.com/zmF94.jpg
<Rex_Mundi> Anyways, im getting some pony toys for christmas, its so cool having a mom that thinks its "cute" that i like ponies, a 22 yearold male. Shes gonna drive me to Bronycon this summer if I dont have my liscense by then.
<Serenity> I'm going to BUCK next year, so woop for me, plus I could probably get some shit there
<ouo> but how could science explain pink fluffy unicorns dancing on rainbow?!
<Barb|Lappy> I wnat to go to BUCK too
<Barb|Lappy> Screw Bronycon.
*Barb|Lappy lives in texas
<Rex_Mundi> Doesnt science know that they found unicorn bones in North korea?
<Serenity> I'm not looking to Bronycon. Too American
<Serenity> I like to stay where it's British to put it nicely
<cachi01|SOTC> bronymexicon ftw
<ouo> http://img.ehowcdn.com/article-new/ehow/images/a06/98/h4/types-miniature-ponies-1.1-800x800.jpg
<ouo> aw
<jcelios> the BUCK acyronem confuses me
<Barb|Lappy> http://i.imgur.com/QX8w3.jpg So... This is why the 21st did not happen the way it was supposed to according to the Mayans
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, from my understanding, it wasn't a unicorn, it was a Kirin. And it's not scientifically proven. It's just the NoKo government making a silly claim that astonishes it's own people and entertains the rest of the world.
<Rex_Mundi> Kandarihu: It was a joke statement, I also dont belive that Kim jung il invented Golf. Whats a Kirin?
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, not sure.
<alexxm> Barb|Lappy didn't randy savage save us well
<Rex_Mundi> I sure hope Bronycon doesnt keep moving away. New York is a decent travel from Massachusetts, but Baltimore is even further! gahh!
<ouo> http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/252/4/5/rainbow__n__socks_by_avfrosty-d5e6fzs.png i can't ever handle this picture
<Barb|Lappy> What did you just say? http://i.imgur.com/ZGRbj.gif
<Canadian_Brony> You want to know what's further than tat Rex_Mundi?
<cachi01|SOTC> ouo: .-.
<Canadian_Brony> British Columbia
<Canadian_Brony> WEST COAST
<Serenity> Barb|Lappy: Hehehehehe
<Barb|Lappy> wat!
<Barb|Lappy> Noo
<cachi01|SOTC> Barb|Lappy: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
<ouo> tonight
<ouo> you
<Rex_Mundi> Canadian_Brony: Are you going to bronycon?
<Canadian_Brony> I wish...
<ouo> ow ow
<ouo> i got sweet tree
<Canadian_Brony> I'm broke and it's an 8-hour flight away, so I'm just hoping BronyCAN is close to home.
<Barb|Lappy> I love this http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/
<cachi01|SOTC> bronycan
<cachi01|SOTC> lel
<Barb|Lappy> Well. I have a new webcomic to keep me occupied for a while
<Canadian_Brony> BronyCAN. Canada's premiere Brony convention, being held in Beautiful British Columbia.
<Rex_Mundi> Canadian_Brony: Is it west coast, its still powerfully away if its in Montreal or something.
<Rex_Mundi> nvm
<cachi01|SOTC> Barb|Lappy: lolcats xd
<Canadian_Brony> it's far if I have to leave the province or mainland. Vancouver Island, Alberta, Yukon, and whatever state is below me.

<cachi01|afk> brb
<Barb|Lappy> Grammar nazis take it to the streets, and make sure you are historically accurate now. http://i.imgur.com/jebk1.jpg
<Barb|Lappy> If you gona offend, then do it correctly.
<Rex_Mundi> Do East coast canadians go to Bronycon, or is there a major east coast brony convention in canada?
<aniderp|bestcakeever> like i said yesterday.. if i get derpy hoodie i will take picture of me in it and post here
<Canadian_Brony> nah, they probably go to Bronycon. BronyCAN is the first Canadian brony convention and it's over here on the west coast, so I would suspect they'd head south.
<Saturn> 08,01http://krowzivitch.deviantart.com/art/Queen-Chrysalis-333324556
<Saturn> 08,01fuck yeah, chrysalis
<Canadian_Brony> shit bro, that's creepy
<Canadian_Brony> I like it!
<Barb|Lappy> http://i.imgur.com/WsbgC.jpg aw. That makes me wnat to be a dad. I would spoil my little girl so much. <3

<Canadian_Brony> Saturn how do you know? I haven't seen many details regarding BronyCAN other than it's in NC next year.
<Canadian_Brony> *BC
<Canadian_Brony> yes, hold a Canadian brony convention in North Carolina -__-
<Rex_Mundi> I know they have a pony meet within Anthrocon now, any bronies near Pittsburg might want to check that out.

<Rex_Mundi> "racist barn" what?
*Canadian_Brony|AFK WASN'T HERE
<rcman914> so nothing is on right now?
*Canadian_Brony|AFK dammit
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> Rex_Mundi "Raise This Barn" sounds like "Racist barn"
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> from the new episode where APPLEJACK SINGS and WRITES A LETTER TO PRINCESS CELESTIA
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> first for the series AND the season
<rcman914> yup
*Canadian_Brony|AFK walks away singing "racist barn racist barn 1 2 3 4~"
<rcman914> wasn't her first one that stated that she didn't learn anything
<Yahooz> technically, Applejack still does not have her own song
<Yahooz> also the new ep was meh
<Bronysith> technically shut up
<rcman914> if you look in the begin of that song, bonbon is techically a member of the apple family
<rcman914> you see her in the crowd
<Buytoast> applehorse's song sounded like something barney would sing in an amish episode
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> rcman914 Applejack writes the first letter of the season
<Bronysith> Canadian_Brony|AFK: false
<Buytoast> pink obnoxious wrote a letter son
<Yahooz> Ponies singing is just... a thing
<Bronysith> Canadian_Brony|AFK: pinkie pie did dumbass
<Buytoast> do you even horses?
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> Bronysith oh, well one of 2 then
<rcman914> didn't her first one in seaon 2 said she didn't learn anything
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> yes it did
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> I have a shirt that says it
<Bronysith> Yahooz: as for the new episode being meh, havent you learned the studio doesnt give 2 shits about applejack so they half ass everything for her?
<Canadian_Brony|AFK> mah favourite shirt http://www.welovefine.com/1708-drink-cider-learn-nothing.html
<jcelios> best part of new ep was FiddleSticks
<Bronysith> actually more quarter ass
<Bronysith> 1/8th ass
<jcelios> Infinitesimal Ass
<Bronysith> ^
<Yahooz> Bronysith: more like I had a terribad experience watching the ep
<Bronysith> Yahooz: did it violate you?
<SpeccyRush> huh http://derpiboo.ru/191010 seems Cloudchaser is also an apple
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Herro.
<jcelios> I think it would be cool to have carrottop some distant relative of applejack
<jcelios> and make her a carrot farmer
<SuperSanjitenks1989> You know what the people should stream?
<JRP2234> 99 luftballons
<SuperSanjitenks1989> A Disney movie.

<SpeccyRush> you missed it
<Bronysith> SuperSanjitenks1989: you should shush and they stream whatever the fuck they want to stream
<jcelios> for all the background filler ponies they used I miss Derpy...
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Bronysith: Geez man, sorry. No need to be harsh.

<Canadian_Brony> oh, puh-LEASE. Don't get me started on spaghetti..
<BaconMane> 0,5It's like, you can't put the stupid ponyisms away for two seconds?
<Barbetos> BaconMane What if everyone but you was turned into a pony? Not RP. Serious question.
<Bronysith> holy shit shut up about spaghetti
<Bronysith> i can enjoy the tasty dish anymore
<Barbetos> can't hold all dis spaghetti...
<BaconMane> 0,5I mean, people shouldn't say ponyisms in real life to start with.
<BroPony|MEDIC> my chat just losts its nuts
<cachi01|SOTC> yep this definetely is my fave colossus
<BroPony|MEDIC> i say em in real life
<Bronysith> BaconMane: the regulars skype caht changed you

<Barbetos> Well.. Yeah. Its different for Tara. She gets PAID to do it.
<BaconMane> 0,5Barbetos: I can't take that question seriously at all.
<Barbetos> BaconMane I dunno why I seriously even considered or asked it honestly
<BaconMane> 0,5Bronysith: I haven't used ponyisms purposely for a long time.
<Barbetos> Just my random I guess.
<Canadian_Brony> I don't go out of my way to say "everypony" irl, but I have said it before just to piss off non-bronies :p
<DashWithRainbows> Lies, BaconMane.
<DashWithRainbows> You use them all the time in skype calls.
<BaconMane> 0,5*purposely*
<Canadian_Brony> Make a craptonne of references to the show and watch the dumb bastard squirm *evil grin*
<Barbetos> Recent DWR ?
<Barbetos> recently*
<DashWithRainbows> Every time.
<Yahooz> Actively hiding your power level is the way to go. Not using ponyisms helps.
<DashWithRainbows> So yes.
<DashWithRainbows> He loves his ponies :3
<Barbetos> Yahooz XD

<BaconMane> 0,5Why must you do it here?
<AdamTheDuck> http://twilight.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/134659929002.jpg
<Barbetos> BroPony|MEDIC No no no.. all we know for sure is people are not expressing their true feelings on the matter. You should ask them if they have a problem with it
<BroPony|MEDIC> i guess rp'n is just impossible not to do
<BaconMane> 0,5Be like "yo man, let's do some rp" if that's your thing
<BaconMane> 0,5And take it elsewhere
<BaconMane> 0,5it's NOT THAT HARD.
<DashWithRainbows> It is, BroPony|MEDIC.
<Yahooz> And this is coming from BaconMane
<BroPony|MEDIC> Barbetos: I have, and they told me they dont care. just dont get carried away and i make sure not to
<DashWithRainbows> It is possible*
<Canadian_Brony> I know. I have been kicked before for excessive RP, so I know the limit.
<Yahooz> trust him when he says this
<BaconMane> 0,5Yahooz: >_>
<Yahooz> hehehehe
<BaconMane> 0,5Trying to purge chat of idiocy here
<Yahooz> BaconMane: oh can i help?
<Bronysith> BaconMane: you are wasting breath
<Prince_Lightstar> BaconMane: i just came and u lied alreadu :|
<Canadian_Brony> I have also been kicked because Wrek was really pissed at me and banned by Saturn simply because I have never been banned before.
<AdamTheDuck> BaconMane, one does not simply purge idiocy from the internet
<Canadian_Brony> I got a 1-minute ban...
<IFDreebs> One must use FIRE >:D
<Yahooz> Canadian_Brony: both typical
<BroPony|MEDIC> i have been kicked once by saturn over a misunderstanding
<Barbetos> Role Play is not a sign of idiocy last I checked. More like... annoyance for people wnating to just... Chat... In, you know, a chat rooom
<Prince_Lightstar> Canadian_Brony: so i had a 2 month ban :
<Yahooz> Ive been kicked at least a good 100+ times now
<Prince_Lightstar> :|
<Barbetos> Then agian.. Some Role Play does beg the question.
<BroPony|MEDIC> i mind my Ps and Qs here
<BaconMane> 0,5Yeah, Barbetos, and the RPers not getting the clue that it isn't a room for RP
<IFDreebs> I've been botkicked. I flood accidentally sometimes. :(
<CrystalPhoenix> Am I a masochist for not playing Bayonetta with Accesories?
<IFDreebs> I type too fast.
<Barbetos> "lightening bolt! lightening bolt!"
<BaconMane> 0,5That is where the idiocy spawns
<BaconMane> 0,5Or, rather, shows
<BaconMane> 0,5Also, *lightning
<cachi01|SOTC> lets sing the song of the lonely mountain mah brothers
<Yahooz> BaconMane: oh god, back in May
<BaconMane> 0,5May?
<Kurra> blah
<Yahooz> thats when it was worse
<Yahooz> the RP
<Barbetos> I spel everything exactly the way I mean to every time I spell it.
<Yahooz> *worst
<BaconMane> 0,5Ah
<Canadian_Brony> Yahooz the thing about it was I questioned something that Wrek said about Luna and then you know the rest.
<BaconMane> 0,5I don't keep track of months
<BroPony|MEDIC> Yahooz: what about may it bad
<BaconMane> 0,5The next month is August, right?
<BaconMane> 0,5:3
<String_Shredder> Yep.
<cachi01|SOTC> yes
<Prince_Lightstar> this is a place where brony meet to watch streams and chat not rp ya ropleplayers
<BaconMane> 0,5Oh sweet I was right :D
<Yahooz> Canadian_Brony: some mods naturally get pissed off more easily than others
<Prince_Lightstar> and talkin bout stream
<cachi01|SOTC> then its november
<String_Shredder> and after comes November.
<Prince_Lightstar> BaconMane: may u plz turn on some youtube vidos
<cachi01|SOTC> then july
<Barbetos> Yes. It can be August. Infact I am fairly certain all the other months of 2013 are just not going to show up.
<cachi01|SOTC> then march
<BaconMane> 0,5I don't stream.
<cachi01|SOTC> and then monday
<String_Shredder> Dont, elsie.
<Barbetos> August is the only one brave enough.
<Spectre|Afk> Wait a minute it's July? Why do I have a tree up>
<Barbetos> So we have... August, then Jan 2014
<Spectre|Afk> *?
<BaconMane> 0,5We can do IRC games
<Canadian_Brony> Yahooz I learned that the hard way. I'm actually quite surprised he didn't ban me for showing disrespect for another mod (in his eyes)
<Yahooz> YES
<Yahooz> IRC GAMES
<AdamTheDuck> IRC games ey?
<BroPony|MEDIC> wat are IRC games

<Canadian_Brony> this should be fun
<Yahooz> or hangman...

<Prince_Lightstar> BaconMane: like when i ask ppl to ask me questions?
<cachi01|SOTC> BaconMane: what about 6 mistakes = we r fucked

<otakon> okay I'm back
<BroPony|MEDIC> WB otakon
<TrixieMuffin> 20 hours dungeon , no trial
<Neotyguy40> Besides, I'm trying to reread Homestuck
*Bronysith protects otakon from chat
<Neotyguy40> I'm starting to actually understand what the heck is going on
<Canadian_Brony> hi otakon. We're playing hangman. Wait your turn and BaconMane will ask you to guess a letter (as soon as Speccy decides what the next phrase will be)
<TheBucket> You can't protect one from the chat
<kidzrul732> do you like cheetos?
<Spyrorocks> dont know what that is
<otakon> what I miss?
<cachi01> i liek trains
*Bronysith kicks TheBucket
<Saturn> 08,01LC! i should come visit you when i come to america!
<otakon> oh
<cachi01> otakon: hangman
<Meth> Why do ya'll like MLP
<otakon> um is there a stream?
<BaconMane> 0,5>_>
*Saturn 08,01shall spank LC for being naughty
<Bronysith> Saturn: be gentle with him
<TheBucket> OW THAT HURT Bronysith
<kidzrul732> I LIKE CHEETOS
<Canadian_Brony> otakon the end of the world.
<Spyrorocks> I dont think everyone here does.
<BaconMane> 0,5We have a phrase!
<cachi01> worst apocalypse ever
<cachi01> we are still alive
<Neotyguy40> Homestuck is a web series that is basically... Too difficult to explain
<BroPony|MEDIC> LETS DO THIS
<TrixieMuffin> neat , what is it ?
<Saturn> 08,01yyyeEEAAhhhh
<SpeccyRvsh> inb4 to easy
<cachi01> gotta go fast?
<Meth> lol
<Canadian_Brony> also otakon, I have determined that your computer is capable of performing tasks that do not require internet access.
<Spectre> This should be interesting
<BaconMane> 0,5New rule for you guys
<Afflict[phone]> I watched one episode, thats it. ive been meaning to watch more just because
<BaconMane> 0,5Since we're trying this out and all.
<TheBucket> rules aren't fun, but ok
<Neotyguy40> In a nutshell it's about 4 kids who play a giant game of The Sims in real life that brings upon the apocalypse
<Spyrorocks> I think its a good series, thats why I watch it.
<BaconMane> 0,5THe number of tries you get is the # of letters in the phrase, x 1.5
<Spyrorocks> http://www.snotr.com/video/8965/
<Spectre> Quick question is there going to be one new rule added after every game
<cachi01> BaconMane: k :)
<Canadian_Brony> a'right
<BroPony|MEDIC> mmm
<Canadian_Brony> let's do this
<otakon> okay back
<otakon> ANOTHER flash crash
<Canadian_Brony> lol
<cachi01> lolololol
<BaconMane> 0,5So our phrase from SpeccyRush is _ _ _ _ - _ _ - _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _ which gives us 24 guesses.
<otakon> this is ridiculous that's one a day now
<BroPony|MEDIC> otakon: Arent thay just lovely
<BaconMane> 0,5Everyone except Speccy can guess
<cachi01> gee i wonder what SpeccyRush is up to
<Canadian_Brony> BaconMane that's just about the entire alphabet there.
<BaconMane> 0,5Now we begin
<Yahooz> Wow
<BroPony|MEDIC> oh
<TheBucket> A
<Spectre> Four words hunh
<Yahooz> hmmm
<cachi01> TheBucket: its not your turn
<CrystalPhoenix> I'll try whenever I get called I guess
<Spectre> *Huh
<DerpyMuffins> BaconMane: U
<Zohrd> :o
<jcelios> otakon: happening to me also, about one a day :<
<TheBucket> :/
<cachi01> DerpyMuffins: ITS NOT UR TURN
<BaconMane> 0,5Otakon, guess: _ _ _ _ - _ _ - _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _
<Canadian_Brony> no
<Canadian_Brony> his name is ota
<Meth> sounds cool
<Canadian_Brony> get it right
<cachi01> lelelelel
<Neotyguy40> Yea
<Neotyguy40> It's very long
<cachi01> uhmm
<Canadian_Brony> quiet cash
<Spyrorocks> also, made a new video yesterday. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O5qBb3Y_Zs
<Spyrorocks> better than my previous haha.
<BroPony|MEDIC> otakon?
<Spyrorocks> still kind of boring.
<SpeccyRvsh> oi potato answer
*cachi01 planks on Canadian_Brony head
<BaconMane> 0,5Times up
<BaconMane> 0,5Canadian brony, guess: _ _ _ _ - _ _ - _ _ _ - _ _ _ _ _ _
<Canadian_Brony> otakon! You imbecile!
<Canadian_Brony> err
<Canadian_Brony> e
<IFDreebs> I call next! :3
<CrystalPhoenix> he's sure taking his time
<BaconMane> 0,5Nice one!
<Neotyguy40> quadrocopter?
<Canadian_Brony> hooray!
<BaconMane> 0,5There are four E's
<BroPony|MEDIC> Nice
<cachi01> EEEE
<Yahooz> hmmm
<Canadian_Brony> How many points do I receive?
<Spyrorocks> thats a hexa
<Canadian_Brony> oh
<SpeccyRvsh> none
<BroPony|MEDIC> Nope
<Neotyguy40> Oh wow
<Canadian_Brony> stfu speccy
<BaconMane> 0,5_ E _ _ - _ _ - _ _ E - E _ _ _ _ _
<Canadian_Brony> oh snap
<IFDreebs> Canadian_Brony, I award you no points, and may god have mercy on your soul.
<cachi01> lelel
<Yahooz> Thats three you imbecile
<pony_1242> let me guess flutter chu is not here
<BaconMane> 0,5oops
<Spyrorocks> this is my mini quad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLVp-0Ih0yc
<cachi01> LELELELEL
<BaconMane> 0,5_ E _ _ - _ _ - _ _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
<twilight_sprinkle> ooh i know, its EEEE EE EEE EEEEEE
<BaconMane> 0,5there we go
<Spectre> I was about to say
<Spyrorocks> no camera mount on the mini quad though
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: lol
<Neotyguy40> I've been wanting to make a quad with my raspberry pi
<pony_1242> whats going on?
<Spyrorocks> I need a proper mount for my hexa so I can stick a gopro on it and not the shitty contour.
<Yahooz> hmmm
<BaconMane> 0,5Cachi01, guess
<BaconMane> 0,5_ E _ _ - _ _ - _ _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
<cachi01> T
<Yahooz> i think i know 3 out of 4 of the words
<Neotyguy40> But I don't know how to get a battery that's both powerful and light enough to run 4 motors
<cachi01> cause theres obviusly a THE out there
<Meth> Whatever you say Mr. Brad
<cachi01> T
<Spyrorocks> I wouldnt use a raspi for flight control.
<BaconMane> 0,5There are two Ts
<cachi01> teen titans tower
<BaconMane> 0,52Ts
<Neotyguy40> Why not?
<BaconMane> 0,5*2Ts
<CrystalPhoenix> now that's surprising
<cachi01> i am real super sand
<taoumi> there is something so satisfying about going onto another plushie makers deviant art and being able to say to you self that their patern needs revision
<Canadian_Brony> sweet
<Spyrorocks> seems like it would serve better for a different project.
<twilight_sprinkle> i think i know 3 words too
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: The Truth / This One Counts! / A Present for Twilight / Rarity's Calm and Collected Solution / Gem Fever
<twilight_sprinkle> dunno the last one tho
<BaconMane> 0,5_ E _ _ - T _ - T _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
<Bronysith> taoumi: yay <3
<BroPony|MEDIC> cachi01: super pooper scoopers are just legenduh
<twilight_sprinkle> oh, nop nvm
<BaconMane> 0,5Bronysith, guess a letter
<weeping_pegasi82> I didnt think it was possible to play hangman in a chat
<cachi01> BroPony|MEDIC: you'll see freezy pop! im stronger than an ant
<Bronysith> BaconMane: was B taken yet?
<Phase4> ooo, hangman
<Neotyguy40> I would probably use vision tracking on it too
<Canadian_Brony> weeping_pegasi82 it is now
<Spyrorocks> the flight control needs a very tight control loop for functions, and its probably going to be a ton of extra work to make a raspi work when theres other options that are quicker.
<BaconMane> 0,5There are no Bs
<cachi01> if an ant was this big ( )
<BroPony|MEDIC> please*
<Spyrorocks> use raspi for vision processing and a dedicated board for flight control
<Phase4> BaconMane, your colour script needs improvments :P
<Neotyguy40> I have an arduino, but it's not powerful enough to run vision tracking software
<Neotyguy40> Good idea
<Yahooz> The first word is stumping me
<Bronysith> BaconMane: S then
<pony_6193> sup every pony
<cachi01> uhm ( )
<BaconMane> 0,5There is 1/24 guesses
<Neotyguy40> Por que no los dos?
<Canadian_Brony> Phase4 yes, now be patient and BaconMane may ask you to guess. Just don't be like ota and run away.
<DerpyMuffins> Why you naked Phase4?
<BaconMane> 0,5Phase4: halp me ;__;
<twilight_sprinkle> i think i know two possible ones for the first word
<BroPony|MEDIC> Ah, you're just fuckin with me
<Yahooz> Bronysith: you get only one guess at a time
<Spyrorocks> atmega328 is powerful enough for basic flight control
<twilight_sprinkle> idk the last one
<Spyrorocks> using arducopter.
<BaconMane> 0,5Bronysith, you cannot ask if a letter is taken, and then ask another one.

<Neotyguy40> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lt9zainYwB1qglqe6.jpg
<Phase4> can't imagine why
<Canadian_Brony> SO MUCH COLOUR
<cachi01> Phase4: lel
<Bronysith> BaconMane: i was asking if someone already said B
<[1]CrystalPhoenix> Dem colours
<Spyrorocks> i dont get it
<DashWithRainbows> I don't Phase4...
<BaconMane> 0,5i cnfyrt see whtay im toyping
<Neotyguy40> Aww
<BaconMane> 0,5u made me nhlind
<DashWithRainbows> You know I love that god damn rainbow text.
<Phase4> :D
<Neotyguy40> Let me check which arduino I got
<Spyrorocks> If you want to get flying, a KKMulticopter board is basic and like $25,
<Canadian_Brony> lol
<BaconMane> 0,5Allrighty
<Buytoast> that's pretty much the same thing bronysith
<Derpy_Hooves> http://ohn1ne.tumblr.com/post/38680555599/this-shit-is-real-i-have-a-bottle-of-the-special
<BaconMane> 0,5So there is 1/24 tries
<BroPony|MEDIC> can i guess a letter
<Spyrorocks> and has an atmega32u i think.
<BaconMane> 0,5Buytoast, guess a letter
<BaconMane> 0,5_ E _ _ - T _ - T _ E - E _ _ _ _ E

<Neotyguy40> I have a mega 2560
<Spyrorocks> Im a DJI Dealer so I sell all the DJI copter products.
<BaconMane> 0,5there is one O
<Yahooz> Of course theres an O
<Spyrorocks> yeah thats more than enough.

<Phase4> BaconMane, for various reasons there doesnt seem to be any way to fix that problem on mirc
<rd1985> hi
<twilight_sprinkle> nuu, do the last word
<Zohrd> h
<Spyrorocks> I only run DJI flight controllers.
<Zohrd> H!
<Phase4> silly dev decided to make his own language and didnt include any proper string formatting
<Sumica> 00,10Alex, i would like to buy a vowle
<twilight_sprinkle> goddamnit
<Neotyguy40> What's DJI?
<Spyrorocks> a company that makes copter stuff.
<Canadian_Brony> Zohrd hush and wait your turn.
<Phase4> because why would you possibly want to format strings in irc scripts
<Spectre> Why did someone say my name?
<Neotyguy40> Aw cool
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica they're free. Now wait your turn like the rest of us lesser folk.
<cachi01> dead to the ??????????????
<Spyrorocks> I crashed a dji s800 into my trampoline
<Spyrorocks> lol
<Sumica> 00,10pffff turns

<Meth> lol
<Canadian_Brony> inorite?
<Canadian_Brony> to bad they EXIST in this game
<Meth> @Neo, I get it
<Spyrorocks> Thats not a cheap copter. Thats the dji professional series.
<TheBucket> I LOST THE GAME
<Meth> Why don't we have both?
<CrystalPhoenix> what game?
<BaconMane> 0,5TheBucket, guess a letter
<BaconMane> 0,5_ E _ _ - T O - T _ E - E _ _ _ _ E
<Canadian_Brony> but I don't have the status to complain about these things
<TheBucket> Umm
<Canadian_Brony> hell, I don't have the status to complain at all
<TheBucket> Um
<TheBucket> U
<Canadian_Brony> "Um" is not a letter
<TheBucket> U is
<twilight_sprinkle> is mayonaise a letter?
<Spyrorocks> But Neotyguy40 if you want kits, I have copter kits and stuff at decent prices.
<TheBucket> Is the 34th letter twilight_sprinkle
<Canadian_Brony> no twilight_sprinkle, mayonaise is not a letter.
<Neotyguy40> That would be cool
<Canadian_Brony> Horseradish is not a letter either!
<twilight_sprinkle> :<
<Spyrorocks> with or without flight controller, if you wanted to do your own I have kits that just have motors, escs, frame, etc etc
<TheBucket> BaconMane: IS THERE A U
<twilight_sprinkle> NO U
<Saturn> 08,01my god, why hasn't anyone said H...
<Canadian_Brony> "No Skrillex, a mac book is not an instrument."
<Spyrorocks> You'd be surprised how much weight they can actually carry
<BaconMane> 0,5There are
<Neotyguy40> Well I have an arduino and a gyroscope
<BaconMane> 0,5No U's
<Meth> Do you sell a Pony Copter?
<Spyrorocks> large LiPo batteries are not a problem.
<TheBucket> FFFFFFFF-
<twilight_sprinkle> dammit dont say h
<Neotyguy40> Really?
<BroPony|MEDIC> Saturn: If i got chosen ._.
<SpeccyRvsh> hah
<Spyrorocks> yeah
<TheBucket> *sepukku*
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: there's an H in it, you silly
<BaconMane> 0,5That's 2/24 guesses.

<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: i know, and then Yahooz will win
<BroPony|MEDIC> Fuck me
<Spyrorocks> when it doesnt have the battery pack.
<BaconMane> 0,5no thnx
<Neotyguy40> I've never used anything smaller than a car battery for robotics projects
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm
<twilight_sprinkle> N
<Saturn> 08,01BroPony|MEDIC: you'll have to buy me dinner first
<BaconMane> 0,5no N's
<twilight_sprinkle> fudge
<BroPony|MEDIC> Saturn: that can be arranged
*SpeccyRvsh does a little dance
<Spyrorocks> If you want a quadcopter, a decent battery would be about 250-300 grams.
<BaconMane> 0,5That's 3/24 guesses. You know, what, only 10 guesses from now on. new rule.
<Saturn> 08,01BroPony|MEDIC: excellent
<Spectre> Again dang
<cachi01> BaconMane: i want to guess the word
<Saturn> 08,01i like indian food
<Neotyguy40> Seriously?
<BaconMane> 0,5That's 3/10 guesses.
<Spyrorocks> yes.

<Buytoast> Can i solve it baconMane?
<BaconMane> 0,5Saturn, you have to wait your turn
<Neotyguy40> Nice

<Saturn> 08,01doggamnit
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn hush silleh filleh
<Neotyguy40> Now let me see what I already have
<BaconMane> 0,5Buytoast, if you think you have it.
<Spyrorocks> On the s800, I run 2x 6S 6000mah packs
<Buytoast> I think I may
<Spyrorocks> for 20 minutes of flight time
*Saturn 08,01isn't good at waiting his turn
<otakon> goddammit
<Buytoast> Head to the Engine
<BaconMane> 0,5Wrong.
<Yahooz> now i dont know the last one
<Yahooz> hmmm
<SpeccyRvsh> WRONG
<Spyrorocks> Those are massive packs, but the s800 is a massive copter.
<Buytoast> shit
<otakon> that is THREE TIMES flash has crashed on this site for some reason
<Neotyguy40> I have an Arduino, so I could probably use that as the controller
<BaconMane> 0,5otakon, guess a letter
<BaconMane> 0,5H E _ _ - T O - T H E - E _ _ _ _ E
<Spyrorocks> its not that simple.

<otakon> L
<Canadian_Brony> otakon don't fuck it up this time
<Saturn> 08,01otakon: it's because you touch yourself at night
<Spyrorocks> You need a lot more than just an arduino
<twilight_sprinkle> dammit two l's i bet
<cachi01> lol
<BaconMane> 0,5There are no L's
<Saturn> 08,019instead of me)
<Neotyguy40> I need motor controllers too, right?
<twilight_sprinkle> hmm
<Canadian_Brony> welp
<Spyrorocks> Get a KKMulticopter board
<cachi01> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
<BaconMane> 0,5That's 4/10 guesses.
<Spyrorocks> its cheap and has everything.
<Canadian_Brony> that first word ain't "hell"
<BaconMane> 0,5Saturn, guess a letter.

<otakon> no L
<otakon> so it's not help
<Spyrorocks> the kits I have come with precalibrated motor controllers.
<Phase4> i want guess
<otakon> or hell
<SpeccyRvsh> oi wait your turns, no helping
<Spectre> Seriously?
<Spyrorocks> it really depends what quality you want and how much you want to spend
<TheBucket> Ponyfied versions of the countries you live in?
<CrystalPhoenix> These disconnection are getting troublesome
<BaconMane> 0,5Saturn?
<BaconMane> 0,5You going to guess?
<Neotyguy40> I have almost nothing to spend.
<Spyrorocks> for a quality DJI quad with a Naza Flight controller is $420
<Saturn> 08,01oh right
<twilight_sprinkle> dammit still last word
<Spyrorocks> $230 of that is the Naza flight controller.
<Saturn> 08,01have we had A yet?
<Canadian_Brony> no
<twilight_sprinkle> i know the first
<BaconMane> 0,5There are no As

<SpeccyRvsh> if everyone would click my link
<BaconMane> 0,5I'll make a phrase.
<twilight_sprinkle> okay
<Spyrorocks> then figure out the flight controller for yourself, or buy a flightcontroller kit from somewhere else.
<Canadian_Brony> is is "Shizuka is best pony"?
<BroPony|MEDIC> DENIED
<Canadian_Brony> *it
<cachi01> SpeccyRush: #1 best seller!
<Neotyguy40> I think the fun would be to figure it out myself :P
<Spyrorocks> Or buy a Naza, which is like the best easiest plug and play system you can get.
<Neotyguy40> (I hope)
<BaconMane> 0,5Intermission!
<Spyrorocks> it depends if you want to tinker or fly.
<Canadian_Brony> cue the music!
<Neotyguy40> Tinker
<cachi01> k brb gettin some pringles
<Neotyguy40> Definitely tinker
<Yahooz> Canadian_Brony: *Vivi
<Spyrorocks> then a KKMulticopter board is what you want
<Spyrorocks> or an ardupilot board.
<BroPony|MEDIC> I've only been chosen once :P
<ShizuKlaus> 13ping?
<Spyrorocks> probably ardupilot apm board, you'd like that.
<Spyrorocks> open source.
<TheBucket> INTERMISSION MUSIC: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHOBw6XwqRo
<cachi01> pong
<Neotyguy40> Is there any reason a generic Arguino wouldn't work?
<Canadian_Brony> have some classic intermission http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqtRBtIJULw&playnext=1&list=PL8926727A5E33D8B2&feature=results_main

<Spyrorocks> you need gyros, barometer, and everything to be laid out properly
<Canadian_Brony> oh shit, that's a playlist
<TheBucket> :/
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqtRBtIJULw
<Canadian_Brony> there
<Spyrorocks> otherwise you will get interference and it wont stabalize.

<Canadian_Brony> just the one video this time
<Neotyguy40> I2C
<Saturn> 08,01and with that, i'm off to bed

*Saturn 08,01thinks he should maybe shower first...
<Spyrorocks> if you want to try to make your own from scratch, you can, but it might not be as fun when it refuses to work after days of tinkering :P
<BroPony|MEDIC> HOLY CRAP TODAYS THE 23RD
<Neotyguy40> I know it would be, but for me the fun is in building it from scratch
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Saturn
<Spyrorocks> brb
<Neotyguy40> lol

<cachi01> Rex_Mundi: no because the show would be shitty after dat
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: Im watching.
<DashWithRainbows> Protip twilight_sprinkle: When it is an admin boss, prepare for incredibly OP-ness.
<KrazyNoobs> cachi01: They just disagreed on something and then my dad took off to New Zealand.
<thelonecubone|BL2> i'm watching :P
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: well, if theres a lot i'll just ask someone else over voice, that'll be easier instead of typing it
<DashWithRainbows> It's always in good fun though.
<BaconMane> 0,5Shizu: did you make the minecraft thing yourself?
<ShizuKlaus> 13dynmap is a plugin
<cachi01> KrazyNoobs: oh damn sorry bout that........
<DashWithRainbows> twilight_sprinkle There is an minimum age required to use the mic.
<ShizuKlaus> 13otherwise it's showing me in realtime more or less
<Rex_Mundi> cachi01: what if it happens after the show ends?
<KrazyNoobs> cachi01: Thanks, I don't think it is going to last long anyway.
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: hm they get special special abilities?
<BaconMane> 0,5As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted by gabens
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Rex_Mundi: mass suicide
<cachi01> Rex_Mundi: that would be cool then
<BaconMane> 0,5Thanks for being my guinea pigs for Elsie's first IRC game time
<BaconMane> 0,5yey
<loGanN> why is my brother twiching
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: i know, im pretty sure im over that age :D
<cachi01> and yeah lotsa suicides lol
<Meth> Ya'll should sign up for my forums
<cachi01> loGanN: cold i guess
<Kipkat07_Scarf> BaconMane: Youre welcome :3
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: i didnt plan to use mic anyway though :P
<KrazyNoobs> BaconMane: Did you manage to have that guy terminated by a PonyChat Mod?
<DashWithRainbows> They have 90k health usually, incredibly powerful rage that I think they get instantly.
<Neotyguy40> Haha
<Neotyguy40> No
<DashWithRainbows> For example.
<loGanN> cachi01: no it hot and hes like spazzing
<Rex_Mundi> Or hell, after the show ends, they should periodicly make TV/DVD specials and a full length feature film, just to Keep FIM alive until G5
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I sell scarves and scarf accessories.
<DashWithRainbows> The Lauren Faust hale uses ALL the rages of other hale's at once.
<twilight_sprinkle> thenks for conducting your experiments on us, BaconMane :P
<cachi01> BaconMane: whenever u need some guinea pig well, here we are :)
<KrazyNoobs> The show is not going to end anytime soon, everypony.
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: lol i didnt even know there is a Lauren boss
<DashWithRainbows> Only way to survive it is to stand on top of a health pack as a pyro, I think.
<DashWithRainbows> twilight_sprinkle Admin only due to being so OP.
<Meth> pwease
<Stormy> the last thing we need is another "darkspyroandcyder293.freeforums.com"
<Stormy> seriously
<Stormy> :P
<DashWithRainbows> Appledoom is my favourite admin hale though.
<Spyrorocks> spyroxcynder4000yolo.freeforums.com
<loGanN> im crying and i dont know why its freaking me out
<Stormy> XD
<Stormy> register it
<Stormy> I would join
<Stormy> :P
<twilight_sprinkle> loGanN: you just need to relax and distract yourself, or try to go to bed if you can
<Afflict> I would definitely join haha
<Spyrorocks> Stormy, got a shirt for christmas http://i.imgur.com/tohe6.jpg :P
<KrazyNoobs> You see, The Hub went from $350,000 per annum in 2011 to $35mil per annum in 2012, 98% being FIM's doing (EQD wrote about this). If DHX Media and Hasbro had any plans on cancelling the show (which would be stupid, they would lose money rapidly), The Hub would beg them to continue. Season 4 is already confirmed, I hope it keeps going.
*Dark92Enigma hugs loGanN
<twilight_sprinkle> DashWithRainbows: perhaps theres a site with information about them?
<Stormy> Christmas already huh?
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: he says his bro is twitchin
<cachi01> and spazzin
<KrazyNoobs> Sorry for dat wall
<Rex_Mundi> Wait, the ending episode for season 3 will have twilights older sister (who is never mentioned until that point) doing... marring somepony ells that we havent heard of to that ponit to!
<Stormy> lol nice
<Spyrorocks> we usually are away for christmas day
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: twitchin n spazzin how?
<Spyrorocks> so we do gifts early.
<DashWithRainbows> Hmm, I think I can grab you the link to their site.
<cachi01> idk
<loGanN> twilight_sprinkle: i have been up for 34 hors in like 30 min ill be 35
<Spyrorocks> and I work christmas eve
<KrazyNoobs> Rex_Mundi: lololol
<cachi01> Rex_Mundi: cadenco
<Stormy> aw that sucks
<GabeMoist> 34 hors!?
<loGanN> hors what are hors
<Spyrorocks> someone's gotta.
<Neotyguy40> I want one of those Wii Us
<Rex_Mundi> hors devours/
<Kimori> Thats perfect for you SR
<Stormy> I finally bought gifts for my brother and sister
<loGanN> im scared
<Stormy> Now just my parents I guess
<spypengen> hors are those people who do stuff with people
<twilight_sprinkle> horse, or prostitutes?
<spypengen> you'll know when you're older
<loGanN> hours not hors
<cachi01> both
<Spyrorocks> I bought my dad a soundbar for his tv
<Spyrorocks> and my grandma this tea steeper thing.
<Stormy> I got my sister a crap ton of makeup
<Dark92Enigma> Rex_Mundi: i doubt they would repeat the formula :D but then again, (new) Spongebob did this sgain and again
<KrazyNoobs> But I personally think that they are going to make Ep10 of Season 3 amazing, have a large waiting time until the other three, and, hopefully, make an epic three-parter halfway through the wait for Season 4. This is probably far from the truth, but it still may be possible.
<Spyrorocks> i got my sister some headphones
<Dark92Enigma> again*
<Stormy> and my brother a PSN card
<loGanN> isnt it spelled whores
<Spyrorocks> I didn't go nuts this year
<Stormy> and some chocolate pretzels
<Stormy> :p
<cachi01> oh yeah only 13 episodes right?
<twilight_sprinkle> it is, but i was making a funny :
<twilight_sprinkle> :P*
<Spyrorocks> I would like to buy someone who doesn't have an xbox 360 an xbox live card.
<KrazyNoobs> Why the w and r?
<cachi01> and we are already in episode 7 right?
<Spyrorocks> that would be funny.
<Kimori> sees candy is the best
<Dark92Enigma> yup
<cachi01> shit
<Neotyguy40> I want candy
<Meth> Kimori wanna join my forums?
<cachi01> this season was 3 months long
<Spyrorocks> Meth, no one wants to.
<cachi01> dafak
<Kimori> Sorry but I'm not a fan of forums
<Kimori> why did you make one?
<GabeMoist> kafad
<Stormy> No one wants to join a forum that doesn't even have any posts
<Kipkat07_Scarf> cachi01: long drought incoming...
<KrazyNoobs> Because we have no information on S3E10 11 12 and 13, (thus, no possibility of spoilers), what do you think the episodes will be on?
<Neotyguy40> Because Spyro Forum needs more competition or something
<Meth> :(
<Stormy> or subforums...
<Spyrorocks> you gotta make like 30 user accounts that are all you posting and talking to yourself.
<Spyrorocks> thats the secret to getting forums started.
<Stormy> lol
<GabeMoist> friendship
<Kimori> lol
<cachi01> twilight gets a visit from the future
<Neotyguy40> That's how Spyrorocks did it
<Stormy> That's not what happened with spyroforum
<Kimori> Something you did before SR?
<cachi01> from a guy called doc brown
<KrazyNoobs> GabeMoist: You just won 10 internet points.
<loGanN> cachi01: y is it only 13 eo?
<Stormy> Unless all of us starting members are secretly SR's alt accounts
<Spyrorocks> thats how I started soliforum
<cachi01> he is riding a time traveling delorean
<Stormy> and don't actually exist
<cachi01> and twilight has to saaaaaaaaave the wooooooooorld
<Spyrorocks> and a few other earlier forums
<cachi01> loGanN: eeyup
<Meth> lol
<Spyrorocks> spyroforum had enough initial people it didnt matter
<loGanN> cachi01: Y
<GabeMoist> cachi01, then they meet the doctor
<cachi01> yeah but he dies
<Meth> cool
<soulrider95> and ride off into the sunset on the backs on transformers?
<GabeMoist> the delorean crashes into the tardis
<loGanN> Y is it only 13 episods!!???
<Stormy> but really
<KrazyNoobs> I am hoping, for 10, a huge reference to pop culture or some more Equestria History, while for E11 - 13, a three parter going more into depth about the Crystal Empire... and Discord, we need lotsa Discord
<cachi01> soulrider95: oi dat season 4 premiere spoiler
<Kimori> You have to realize too Meth, our own Spyro forum here is not that active
<Kipkat07_Scarf> because god hates us.
<soulrider95> XD
<Kimori> We would rather have our forum more active..
<Rex_Mundi> I aint talking, they tried to get me to talk before, but i dont aim to now by gum.
<KrazyNoobs> loGanN: I am guessing Littlest Pet Shop had to be made to
<Kimori> than move to a brand new forum
<loGanN> awww
<Stormy> if you're actually serious about trying to compete with SF and dS, it's really not gonna happen
<loGanN> now im crying
<Meth> I'm not gonna try and compete
<Spyrorocks> Ill crush you like a bug.
<Meth> No reason too
<Stormy> Spyro really doesn't have an audience that uses the internet
<Kipkat07_Scarf> LPS! Y U TAKE AWAY FROM PONY
<Meth> haha
<Stormy> at least not anymore
<cachi01> BECAUSE HASBRO
<cachi01> THATS WHY
<Spyrorocks> we're like the mafia here.
<KrazyNoobs> loGanN: I watched Littlest Pet Shop, and it is just some cheap rip-off of MLP, in my opinion (no offence to LPS fans, sorry. :( )
<Spyrorocks> you wanna open another forum ehh?
<Stormy> lol
<Spyrorocks> well lets just see about that.
<Stormy> BAN BAN BAN
<Kimori> well, give it some time, eventually the kids will grow up and maybe join this place :)

<Meth> haha
<Stormy> D:

<KrazyNoobs> I hate LPS, and hopefully, it doesn't go into Season 2. If it doesn't go into Season 2, we will probably have 26 episodes for Season 4... i dunno, it is complicated
<pony_3059> is there anyone here that used to watch true capitalist radio?
<Kimori> noooo
<Stormy> mwahaha

<Kipkat07_Scarf> pony_3059: Sending spies into the GNAA is impossible sadly. They're like Anonymous. They have no leader and thus each member does what they want. Yes they can launch organized attacks but they are usually from a local area or website. Rarely is there ever a large scale assault and in the off chance that there is, they are rare, unpredicatble, and hard to prevent.
<Spyrorocks> my sister got justin beiber perfume.
<Meth[Television]> so...
<Stormy> lolwut
<loGanN> KrazyNoobs: i love you...
<Spyrorocks> I asked her if she now smells like justin beiber.
<cachi01> i shel star new utub zreas
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Why did I start a dolan riot... WHY?!!!
<soulrider95> I love everyone here. Full homo
<Meth[Television]> Is your sister hot?
<Stormy> I thought Justin Bieber wasn't cool anymore
<cachi01> ehts goin 2 b culld th uncl twoiloight show
<KrazyNoobs> There are plenty of bronies in the GNAA, me being one (I have no connection with the hack)
<Kipkat07_Scarf> soulrider95: me too
<Spyrorocks> I thought it was all about one direction now.
<KrazyNoobs> Haters hacked us
<loGanN> soulrider95:
<Stormy> Yeah
<Spyrorocks> Meth[Television], too hot for you.
<Stormy> My cousin is obsessed with them
*soulrider95 takes Kipkat07_Scarf to mah bed
<sub06905> more like hijacked
<Kipkat07_Scarf> If I knew how to hack I would maybe join Anonymous because they hack the people who deserve it.
<Meth[Television]> Hook me up with her ;)
<cachi01> ^
<Neotyguy40> Meth
<Stormy> =/
<Spyrorocks> hahahaha
<KrazyNoobs> But I knew about it, and when I see what those Ns put up on this site, I was laughing, but at the same time, crying, because I just wanted to see the episode.
<pony_3059> ^
<Stormy> dude you're 14, don't be stupid
<thelonecubone|BL2> yay, I found a gun similar to the Hunting rifle :3
<Spyrorocks> Only if you're rich.
<Neotyguy40> You can't even get your friend's girlfriend out of your mind
<soulrider95> Anon doesnt hack, they only DDOS....
<Stormy> oh wait
<Kipkat07_Scarf> KrazyNoobs: wait... you KNEW?!!
<Rex_Mundi> We can talk about the latest episode now right?
<KrazyNoobs> Anonymous is good, GNAA is evil.
<Spyrorocks> My sister is 16
<Kipkat07_Scarf> soulrider95: thats what I meant
<Meth[Television]> True
<cachi01> racist barn racist barn
<Buytoast> goddamn are you people STILL going on about the hijack?
<cachi01> together we can racist barn
<Buytoast> get over it already
<thelonecubone|BL2> Buytoast: looks like it
<cachi01> RACIST
<sub06905> ikr
<cachi01> BARN
<Meth[Television]> I make $200k a year though, doesn't matter
<ShizuKlaus> 13yay fireplace works
<sub06905> :I
<KrazyNoobs> Kipkat07_Scarf: Yeah, but everyone else in the GNAA hated the ones who were going to hack them anyway, they were the stupid ones that hacked.
<soulrider95> DDOS is easy, hacking? near impossible.
<Neotyguy40> Really?
<Meth[Television]> Yes.
<Neotyguy40> Through what? Modelling?
<Spyrorocks> Thats "well off", not rich.
<Meth[Television]> True.
*Stormy really hopes Neotyguy40 isn't actually that gullible...
<soulrider95> most 'hacks' recently were just backdoors left open, no cracking or anything required.
<Rex_Mundi> Did we see apple Fritter in the latest episode, i dont think I saw her.
<Meth[Television]> But if you are 14 making your own money -- more then your parents put together, it is all good
<Kipkat07_Scarf> KrazyNoobs: so why U in teh GNAA
<KrazyNoobs> All they had to do was connect their ManyCam to the site by hacking it, and then they played our anthem while showing ChickenMan.
<Spyrorocks> Theres well off, then theres rich, then theres "fuck you" money.
<pony_3059> by the way, how did they even hack the site anyway? does an admin here know?
<Neotyguy40> ***Stormy really overestimates my gullibility
<cachi01> pony_3059: hijacked
<thelonecubone|BL2> Hijacked*
<cachi01> not hacked
<KrazyNoobs> Kipkat07_Scarf: For trolling idiots, not trolling bronies. I am a brony, and I would never do a THING to other bronies. They are mah bros.
<Buytoast> it wasn't a hack
<cachi01> and it wasnt the site
<Buytoast> now drop it
<cachi01> it was the stream
<Neotyguy40> ***Neotyguy40 would like to know how one does the three asterick thingy
<Meth[Television]> I am not lieing
<pony_3059> kks
<thelonecubone|BL2> everyone, Drop it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> "hacking it" lol
<loGanN> i need slep
<Kipkat07_Scarf> KrazyNoobs: Space is 20% Cooler is our anthem
<KrazyNoobs> It was the stream.
<Stormy> Neotyguy40, /me
<Spyrorocks> rich is when your pulling in millions
<sub06905> it was silly mips security
<thelonecubone|BL2> Just, drop it
<pony_3059> meh, same thing
<Polydunami> Well, I came in at a MARVELOUS time :|
<Spyrorocks> well off is hundreds of thousands
<loGanN> I NEED SLEP
<Polydunami> Hey there, everypony!
*Neotyguy40 : Okay
<soulrider95> lol mips and security in the same sentence
<Spyrorocks> then fuck you money is pulling in billions.
<GabeMoist> Ohai Polynomial
<texasboykc09> hello Polydunami
*Kipkat07_Scarf knocks out loGanN
<Polydunami> :P
*Kipkat07_Scarf drags loGanN to bed
<Meth[Television]> ok
<Meth[Television]> lol
<loGanN> Kipkat07_Scarf: no u didny
<Kipkat07_Scarf> nighty
<cachi01> Polydunami: u missed hangsman
<Rex_Mundi> *snuggles up to Polydunami*
<KrazyNoobs> Just to sum it up, I am a member of the GNAA, but I do not support hacking. I just crapspam IRC boards (not this one, I respect this one too much to do something like that)
<thelonecubone|BL2> pony_3059: nope its not, haking needs skill, Hijacking is taking over
<Spyrorocks> That concludes our economics class of the day.
*Neotyguy40 is very gullible
<pony_3059> how did they hijack it then?
<Polydunami> You mean where you guess letters, cachi01?
<thelonecubone|BL2> there is a difference now drop the convo pls
<Polydunami> Because I know that as hangman
<Stormy> teach us about poor people
<cachi01> yep
<pony_3059> magic
<cachi01> Polydunami: how did that fucking s got there?
<Neotyguy40> You don't need to learn about them
<Spyrorocks> They be poor.
<sub06905> so how bout dem sea ponies
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Polydunami: I won two rounds :D
<Stormy> like broke college students
<SpeccyRush> INCOMING!!!
<Stormy> Oh wait, I can do that
<Neotyguy40> Just make sure you know it's illegal to be poor
<KrazyNoobs> There are automated programs that send 100 messages per second on any given IRC board, before I was a brony, I did that ONLY ONCE on here, but forgive me for that. That was long ago, I have almost no involvement in the GNAA now.
<thelonecubone|BL2> sub06905: I wub them ^w^
<Polydunami> Is it too late for more rounds?
<Meth[Television]> I used to be poor -- But I got myself where I am today
<Spyrorocks> Broke college students are worse than poor people because they actually think they are going to accomplish something.,
<thelonecubone|BL2> Polydunami: eeyup
<Meth[Television]> yup
<BaconMane> 0,5"GNAA"
<KrazyNoobs> dat fire
<Stormy> Spyrorocks, I hate you now :(
<Spyrorocks> hahahaha
<Spyrorocks> I told that to a few other friends
<Spyrorocks> and they be mad.
<BaconMane> 0,5Calling that group an association is nonsensical.
<texasboykc09> KrazyNoobs, hpw about what heppan this morning
<pony_3059> kk, thanks
<DaringDerpy> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America ?
<Neotyguy40> Broke college students are worse than poor people because they continually complain that they're poor but they can still afford to go to school
<KrazyNoobs> What happened this mornin'
<cachi01> KrazyNoobs: wait
<BaconMane> 0,5It doesn't even deserve an acronym.
<soulrider95> GNAA sounds like a angry sheep. GNAAAAAAA
<Rommulus> G'day all what are we watching?
<Stormy> Except they can't
<Polydunami> Everything about the name is nonsensical, BaconMane
<BaconMane> 0,5And KrazyNoobs that's enough out of you.
<Neotyguy40> Or have enough credit to get a loan to go to school
<KrazyNoobs> BaconMane: But then news channels would say the name on television
<Stormy> they pay for it with loans
<cachi01> KrazyNoobs: was it u last year january?
<KrazyNoobs> BaconMane: Okay, I be quiet now
<Meth[Television]> lol
<sub06905> ah the good ol' shizu fireplace
<texasboykc09> KrazyNoobs, spambots
<Stormy> and you don't need credit for student loans
<Spyrorocks> If you have $20 in your pocket and no debt, you have more than like 35% of amercians.
<KrazyNoobs> BaconMane: I don't do that stuff anymore, that was over a year ago
<KrazyNoobs> now lets drop it
<KrazyNoobs> pls
*Kipkat07_Scarf goes to his happy box
<BaconMane> 0,5We don't need to hear about your supposed "hacking skills" or whatever or your involvement in some pathetic internet troll group.
<Polydunami> I'm okay with dropping it.
<BaconMane> 0,5People are complaining.
*soulrider95 goes to happy sphere.
<Meth[Television]> lol
<texasboykc09> ^^

*Kipkat07_Scarf rolls his happy box down the stairs
<Meth[Television]> lol
<Kipkat07_Scarf> AHHH FUUUUUUU-
*Kipkat07_Scarf hits his head and faints
<Polydunami> You guys are lucky in the southern hemisphere :|
<Neotyguy40> <Insert circlejerk about philosophy, art, and english majors>
<Stormy> Yeah, as long as you don't do something dumb like liberal arts or philosophy or art history
<cachi01> u sure u want me to drop it? http://historylink101.com/ww2photo/atomic-bomb-fat-boy.jpg

<Meth[Television]> :D
<Stormy> Meth please don't start that again
<Stormy> It's just obnoxious
<KrazyNoobs> High temps?

<loGanN> i need to SLEEEEPPPP oodbye mery crhrismas
<Buytoast> because cold > warmth
<BaconMane> 0,5Okay
<soulrider95> Buytoast: yup
<Buytoast> you cannot prove me wrong
<Stormy> I don't think English is _that_ bad
<Ninjazz> But I like the cold, Poly.
<ShizuKlaus> 13basement's done
<BaconMane> 0,5Now I am going to leave
<Neotyguy40> I do
<KrazyNoobs> It is summer here in Australia.
<Stormy> I'd never major in it
<KrazyNoobs> Bye BaconMane!
<BaconMane> 0,5But the other mods and regulars will be watching
<texasboykc09> bye BaconMane
<thelonecubone|BL2> Bye BaconMane :)

<MakerDusk> always_watching.jpg
<BaconMane> 0,5If I get one more complaint about what's being said in here, we're going to have issues.
<Stormy> But it's not _completely_ useless career wise like philosophy
<Neotyguy40> There are not enough jobs available for English majors unless you plan to teach it
<BaconMane> 0,5Understand?
<Polydunami> Yeah, actually, I kind of prefer the cold air to hot myself
<loGanN> goodniye

<Meth[Television]> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-384328.html#384328

<Spyrorocks> I dont think it needs to be fixed.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> cachi01: yes.
<Neotyguy40> I don't think it can be fixed
<soulrider95> Buytoast: I prefer spicyness for flavors sake, not just to be hot. But if it isn't hot enough, the flavor can't save it. Tis a delicate balance.
<DaringDerpy> welcome to the herd :)

<Kipkat07_Scarf> thelonecubone|BL2: I try to be as mature as possible when life permits. I prefer people to think Im older than I am because I hate most people who are my age because a large number are so very immature

<Kipkat07_Scarf> I am going to regret the pain
<Meth> lol

<Kipkat07_Scarf> I have 3 years to think about it though.
<Neotyguy40> +o Neotyguy40
<Kimori> I think that would ban everybody
<thelonecubone|BL2> Kipkat07_Scarf: and you will regret when you try to remove it
<GabeMoist> RainbowDashSavior, ohgod
<twilight_sprinkle> RainbowDashSavior: at least that one seems temporary
<Neotyguy40> +kick All
<Polydunami> What did he stuff in his underwear? :P
<Neotyguy40> +kick Meth
<Meth> lol
<Stormy> kick would be like /kick
<Neotyguy40> +kick Neotyguy40
<RainbowDashSavior> lmfao

<Stormy> I had some tutorials on the epic-chat website
<thelonecubone|BL2> No, I mean, you have to pay thousands to get it removed and it's painful as hell which i had heard from
<GabeMoist> Some more advice. Never get a tattoo in a language you don't understand
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: i had a bunch of good rarity pics, but you didnt show your byrobowl-worshipping butt in here often enough
<Kipkat07_Scarf> AAAAAH JESUS FUCKING CHRIST

<Neotyguy40> Don't give me that
<Stormy> Halfop or above
<Kimori> you can kick yourself
<Kimori> type /quit

<Kimori> haha
<Neotyguy40> But typing 'why' requires the use of typing 'y'
<Meth> I am currently laughing out loud.
<Neotyguy40> The string literal contains the character literal
<Stormy> that's why I said instead of
<Stormy> :P

<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: where?
<Ninjazz> The first one I meant.
<Meth> Neotyguy40, what is your name?

<Neotyguy40> You know
<ouo> but not canon place
<RaveBrony> ShizuKlaus: Im hoping for it! :( But who would i play with?
<Kimori> You wanted a Critic on trolling Meth? ill give it a try...ok first when you impersonate people it is just anooying, but I told you this already, using actors names or famous people is new and havent seen someone try doing that before so ill give you that for trying something new, but why your doing this on purpose ill have no idea and will guess that you are just bored or want some attention, if this is too long for you then I will assume your n
<GabeMoist> ShizuKlaus, I have it
<ouo> you should did it higher
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: yeah, the artist is very good
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: I bought it as a five month early present with my moms credit card
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't think I'm gonna receive a gift for Christmas. :c
<Meth> my n?
<DashWithRainbows> And why should I, ShizuKlaus?
<Meth> noggin?
<Stormy> character limit
<Stormy> Just wait

<Ninjazz> twilight_sprinkle, I'll look at his other stuff. I like his style.
<DashWithRainbows> XD
<Kimori> where did it stop? it shows on mine
<DashWithRainbows> Fair do's.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> ShizuKlaus: If someone would code me maybe, I doubt my dad would buy it...
<cachi01> lego without the pain on stepping on one
<Meth> assume your n
<sub06905> ^
<Petrified_Discord> I have never stepped on Minecraft at 4 in the morning though
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ShizuKlaus: but it doesnt hurt when you step on it
<RainbowDashSavior> Kipkat07_Scarf: just lol xD
<Petrified_Discord> dat Kipkat07_Scarf
<Kimori> ou wanted a Critic on trolling Meth? ill give it a try...ok first when you impersonate people it is just anooying, but I told you this already, using actors names or famous people is new and havent seen someone try doing that before so ill give you that for trying something new, but why your doing this on purpose ill have no idea and will guess that you are just bored or wa
<Kimori> nt some attention, if this is too long for you then I will assume your not reading this far, if you are then kudos to you for actually reading to this point, anyways the trolling is still anooying, turn it down so we wont be so anooyed.
<GabeMoist> I think the best Minecraft world I've seen is Minecraft Gensokyo
<Kipkat07_Scarf> wait... the tatoo or my comment?
<Meth> k
<Kimori> enjoy the read :]
<Meth> kudos to me! :D
<Petrified_Discord> no idea
<Kimori> wow
<Kimori> I cant believe you read all that then.
<Neotyguy40> You want a critic on your critic Kimori? I'll give it a try. Okay, first of all the 'c' in critic is not capitalized. Second of all you forgot a bunch of apostrophes, but I will generalize it into grammatical mistakes. You also made it too long. Criticism should never reach past the character limit.
<cachi01> i dont even know what my fucking attacks are dude
<Meth> I read 130 WPM
<Stormy> I like random statistics too
<Kipkat07_Scarf> hahah

<Kipkat07_Scarf> http://i.techrepublic.com.com/blogs/arrogant_linux.jpg <---- Me.
<Meth> lol
<RainbowDashSavior> @Kipkat07_Scarf do you have Gentoo?
<Kandarihu> In order to be a total hipster, you need to be in a far more obscure restaurant that still uses wi-fi, while writing a book on your Mac. It has to be running Linux, and it can't be Ubuntu, any of it's varients, Debian, or Gentoo.
<Neotyguy40> "You captchalogue the IRRADIATED STEAK and save it for your trip outside."
<valoreins> http://cdn.duelinganalogs.com/comics/2007-04-02.png
<Stormy> let me guess
<Stormy> Homestuck?
<Neotyguy40> "You probably shouldn't waste much more time. You wouldn't want all those nice depleted steak isotopes to settle down."
<texasboykc09> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3-vBBQKOYU
<Kipkat07_Scarf> RainbowDashSavior: I have ubuntu but I want to start using Debian soon
<Neotyguy40> Yes
<RainbowDashSavior> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjGSMUep6_4
<ouo> what are you? Penguin?
<RainbowDashSavior> keep watching till you Install Gentoo
<Stormy> I feel like I'm missing out on some really big thing
<Stormy> But I can't make myself care enough to get past the first part of it
<Kandarihu> I guess I wouldn't mind Ubuntu. I guess that makes me a sellout to Canonical.
<Neotyguy40> Lol
<Neotyguy40> The first part is boring
<Stormy> I tried reading it twice
<Neotyguy40> It gets exciting and confusing after
<Stormy> It was incredibly boring
<Neotyguy40> I read through the entire thing once already. I'm trying to again because now I can understand it
<RainbowDashSavior> any /g/entoomen in here?

<Pokecolt> Guys, where's the chestnuts?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> fuck a duck that didnt work....
<Pokecolt> We can't have a fire without chestnuts!
<Pokecolt> D:
<ouo> but too many kids playing with linux :\
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MgNRTq4Uu4&list=PL0F49B3DB40DC9397
<RainbowDashSavior> can we start a google chrome vs firefox war in here?
<Pokecolt> Firefox is better. Kthx. :>
<Kipkat07_Scarf> chrome wins. Game over
<Polydunami> Maybe link the image rather than the google image page.
<Pokecolt> Nope.jpg
<Kipkat07_Scarf> OH ITS ON.
<RainbowDashSavior> agreed, firefox is better.
<thelonecubone|BL2> RainbowDashSavior: yeah let's not
<twilight_sprinkle> chrome ftw
<texasboykc09> ^
<thelonecubone|BL2> ^^
<thelonecubone|BL2> :>
<Polydunami> I seem to load pages faster with Firefox but that's just me
<Polydunami> :P
<Pokecolt> How about we just all get into agreement than IE is worst.
<Pokecolt> :>
<Pokecolt> that*
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Man I'm bored
<twilight_sprinkle> naw IE is best
<Polydunami> ^
<texasboykc09> IE is the worst
<Polydunami> ^_^
<GabeMoist> I prefer Netscape
<Polydunami> Opera all the way, baby
<Pokecolt> I prefer safari over IE. -.-
<twilight_sprinkle> IE is the best piece of software in existance, kthxbai
<RainbowDashSavior> Firefox has everything google chrome has, even without addons. Firefox also has a much larger add on community, and i dont decide which browser to pick based on a few millseconds of startup speed.
<RainbowDashSavior> pwned.
<twilight_sprinkle> firefox takes a ton of cpu
<twilight_sprinkle> chrome takes way less
<RainbowDashSavior> it takes 7% of mine
<Pokecolt> Lol, I think flashplayer is taking up all of my usage cause of the stream.
<RainbowDashSavior> and i got an amd 955
<twilight_sprinkle> one page on firefox is 20ish percent, which is about how much 7-8 tabs on chrome takes
<Pokecolt> Firefox is taking 00-02 atm.
<twilight_sprinkle> 20ish for me that is
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Firefox eats up alot of cpu
<RainbowDashSavior> Google supports CISPA.
<Meth> :d
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Chrome wins the internet. Nuff said.
<ShizuKlaus> 13anyone still watching? roof going up :)
<twilight_sprinkle> chrome and firefox both have their pluses and minuses
<Pokecolt> Shiza, why is the room on fire?! D:
<twilight_sprinkle> and multipliers
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> ShizuKlaus: I wish I could help...I want minecraft so badly
<Pokecolt> My video is just a fire... .-.
<RainbowDashSavior> firefox>chrome tho
<RainbowDashSavior> in terms of everything but speed
<twilight_sprinkle> speed And cpu usage
<Pokecolt> I always thought firefox was a lot easier to navigate through and I have always felt like it was a secure browser since I started using it.
<RainbowDashSavior> thats speed too lol
<twilight_sprinkle> and cpu usage is one of the most important things, and so is speed
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Chromium is best browser
<twilight_sprinkle> its not the same
<twilight_sprinkle> one is the result of the other, but not the same
<Pokecolt> I have never had a single unwanted pop up with firefox. And firefox tends to warn me a lot better than google chrome does about malicious websites.
<twilight_sprinkle> Pokecolt: odd, the opposite for me
<RainbowDashSavior> i usally have 30 tabs open daily, its not much of a problem for me
<texasboykc09> alot of tabs RainbowDashSavior
<Pokecolt> My clarifications with the three is this: IE: Most compatible. Firefox: Best security. Chrome: Best for running on dinosaur PCs.
<twilight_sprinkle> so do i, but 30 tabs in mozilla takes too much cpu for me
<RainbowDashSavior> my glorious tabs
<ShizuKlaus> 13hahaha ie compatibility
<twilight_sprinkle> i usually have 35ish tabs on chrome
<Pokecolt> IE can run any website ever without problems. xD
<GabeMoist> I somtimes reach 100+ tabs
<ShizuKlaus> 13except any site using reasonable CSS
<twilight_sprinkle> 75 is my max for tabs
<texasboykc09> 10 for me
<Pokecolt> I have found sites that still make me use IE to run them.
<Pokecolt> It's really annoying.
<Pokecolt> :l
<ShizuKlaus> 13yes because IE thinks standards are for the weak
<ShizuKlaus> 13microsoft has always preferred to pretend standards don't exist

<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Anyone feel like streaming?
<flutterfan99> BIG MEATY CLAWS
<twilight_sprinkle> britishness is so hilariously overrated. sure theyve done cool things, but people seem to think theyre theyre like a nation of geniuses
<flutterfan99> this IS streaming
<Afflict> night
<thelonecubone|BL2> naw, technicly it's not
<the_real_pony_1604> nation of geniuses, with bad teeth
<RainbowDashSavior> does the admin accept stream requests?
<twilight_sprinkle> dunno much about teeth
<killerpony7733> RainbowDashSavior Nope
<thelonecubone|BL2> RainbowDashSavior: not a stream
<flutterfan99> we need a dramatic reading of twas the night before christmas
<thelonecubone|BL2> just a loop
<killerpony7733> RainbowDashSavior Mods stream what they want.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So bored right now
<RainbowDashSavior> kks
<thelonecubone|BL2> and what killerpony7733 said
<Kipkat07_Scarf> The Sun Never Sets. Nuff said.
<Pokecolt> Guys... Why was Bon bon and Cloud chaser at the apple family reunion?
<the_real_pony_1604> yes
<Polydunami> Probably fillyfriends/dates
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FJKewvQ7-Q&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
<Pokecolt> I asked why was. >.<
<Pokecolt> Maybe.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Polydunami: CHEATER!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Lyra is gonna be piiiised
<GabeMoist> Welp, I'm goin nao
<GabeMoist> Bai gais
<flutterfan99> i was gone for the apple famly reunuon and it didn't record so i need to watch that soon
<RainbowDashSavior> bai bai
<thelonecubone> Bye GabeMoist
<Pokecolt> I am listening to the raise this barn song.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: so what, you actually like colonization?
<Polydunami> Whoops, I forgot about LyraxBonBon
<Pokecolt> And saw bon bon and cloud chaser.
<Pokecolt> >.<
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: yes.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I ask again
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The apple family is everywhere right?
<Sabershy> Hello eerypony:)
<Polydunami> Hey there, Sabershy
<thelonecubone> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: problaly
<RainbowDashSavior> yea, thats what they said in episode 1
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> How the fuck is Applejack poor again?
<thelonecubone> Hi Sabershy :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: you realize colonization requires murder of innocents, as well as aggressive and unjust behavior?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Seriously
<Pokecolt> Spade, applejack is not poor obviously. She has purchased almost 3 barns worth of wood already this season.
<Pokecolt> 2 during too many pinkies episode.
<Pokecolt> And 1 in most recent episode.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: not always. In some cases the ruling party is benevolent & understanding to the colinists desires
<twilight_sprinkle> AHAHAHA
<killerpony7733> twilight_sprinkle Soo can that include the mass murdering of the indians?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXZbQ0ZI4E4&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: there is always nationalistic elitism of a country that took over its new territories, they are always used for resources, and its people are always oppressed
<the_real_pony_1604> easy there, we did a fare share of that also killer
<RainbowDashSavior> considering how much acres of land applejack owns, and the amount of appletrees she harvests ever year, she should be a millionare
<Afflict> *sigh* what a day
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I cant stand countrys who think they're the best
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Fucking snobs
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<thelonecubone> ^^
<Polydunami> http://macalaniaa.deviantart.com/art/Waterfall-Rarity-344221121
<Kimori> yep..
<Kipkat07_Scarf> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Cough*amer*Cough*ica*cough
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You're no better than the rest of us asshole
<Buytoast> The only superior country is Uncle Sam's own pride and joy.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Kipkat07_Scarf: Hey I live in america and I hate the place
<Kipkat07_Scarf> me to
<Buytoast> you bite your tongue
<Kipkat07_Scarf> *Too
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: oh really, youre sayign britain is the best here
<RainbowDashSavior> U DONT TALK CRERP BOUT MERICAN' LAND
<Buytoast> Uncle Sam didn't give his life for you to squander his beautiful gift.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> America is run by morons who couldent manage a burger joint properly
<Polydunami> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvsX03LOMhI
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: exactly. I am american but I think britain is better,
<pyrocatboy> Aw shit AMURIKA!
<taoumi> i wana make a pon. but i need to make my blanket first.... but blankets are so BORING nuergh
<pyrocatboy> traior
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: it doesnt matter, that is nationalism, it is irrelevant where you are born
<RainbowDashSavior> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> nationalism is even worse than racism as it puts one nation above all others
<killerpony7733> You know try asking a regular ol' american about if he knows how exactly they got their land
<Buytoast> Of course I know how.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> IE Germany
<twilight_sprinkle> ive never heard a Single american say "our country is the best"
<Buytoast> We wrested it from the hands of Communists who wanted us living in caves.
<twilight_sprinkle> in fact they all said the opposote
<Buytoast> But we showed them.
<taoumi> MERICA #1
<killerpony7733> I bet'cha almost none will recall how the indians were murdered and pushed out of their country and forced to accept it.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: move to my town...
<Buytoast> MURIKA will stand tall and proud as the leader of this brave new world.
<taoumi> merica
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> twilight_sprinkle: I have a hard time telling if Buytoast is beign sarcasting or dead fucing serious
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Buytoast: Sure as soon as Obama fucking leaves town
<RainbowDashSavior> N ALL DON TERK CRERP BOUT MURIKA'
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: there are bad parts in all countries, saying britain is the best is nationalism and its no better than americans saying america is the best
<taoumi> ...merika?
<twilight_sprinkle> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: sarcastic
<pyrocatboy> taoumi 'MURIKCA
<taoumi> MURIKA!!
<RainbowDashSavior> N WE MURIKANS WLL RERISE UP N TERK ALL THUR LAND
<pyrocatboy> AMERICA! FUCK YEAH
<Buytoast> Obama was chosen by the spirit of Uncle Sam himself to lead this country.
<KrazyNoobs> im back everypony
<taoumi> ERR THER LURND
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: I think britain is better than america. I didnt say it was the best, I simply think that it is more efficient at running a country than the US government
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmEay7Ys83g&list=LLF7smc0TDtWWIknqKADKOUw
<Buytoast> Don't you go defiling the rpesidency because of your racist ways.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> TURK ERR JURBZ
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Buytoast: Then Uncle Sam must have been drunk off his ass to pick him
<RainbowDashSavior> DURKUR DURRR
<KrazyNoobs> Now arguing about countries? LOL
<pyrocatboy> kipkat has a point on that
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> He couldent run a buisness properly
<Buytoast> The only thing Uncle Sam gets drunk off of is patriotism.
<Buytoast> As we all are.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Not me
<KrazyNoobs> stralia
<Buytoast> Let us all drink deep from the waters of MURIKA and eat the Burgers of Oppurtunity.
<taoumi> YEAH STRAILIA
<Polydunami> I'm from Canada. All we get drunk on is whiskey.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: they have their own problems too, even if less perhaps, but its far from perfecy
<taoumi> BERTEN! WOO
<Buytoast> For we will stand strong and lead all in Uncle Sam's honor.
<pyrocatboy> Australia is a total bro though.
<Sabershy> come from Equestria!
<Sabershy> *I
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: also i recall you once saying that british people are smarter, and that is nationalism
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Buytoast: as soon as we get decent government and out of debt
<Polydunami> Is it warm there, Sabershy? :3
<taoumi> EREQWERSTERA!!
<RainbowDashSavior> N TERK, N TERKK, N WE MERIKANS N NO CER BERT UR LEURD, N WE MERIKANS R THE FREE PERPLE OF ORU LEUURD
<KrazyNoobs> Funny thing is, here in Australia, only the Westerns and Outback people have Kangaroos. Only very few of us have kangaroos as pets on the East Coast
<KrazyNoobs> Although Kangaroos are everywhere in Australia
<Sabershy> Why yes, Polydunami. Yes it is. :3
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: I said that because of teh lackluster education in America compared to other countries.
<Buytoast> Debt is merely the price of our superiority.
<pyrocatboy> true
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Buytoast: More along the lines of stupidity
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: but in terms of higher education, its actually one of the best countries
<pyrocatboy> i was not talking to buytoast
<Buytoast> We've saved the world so much that our enemies are using money in their latest tactic.
<Polydunami> I was wondering because I don't see the ponies wearing much in the way of clothing :$
<Buytoast> But we shall overcome.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Right... "saved"
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: but we could be doing better is all.
<taoumi> why would you buy toast? i know you can but i still don't understand why
<Polydunami> Because all toasters toast toast.
<Polydunami> Er, toast BREAD.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kipkat07_Scarf: thats not at all what you said though.
<Sabershy> Polydunami: Its like saying is it warm at that nudist beach... >_>
<Buytoast> We won the Revolutionary War, the War on Terror and the War of 1812 all by ourselves!
<taoumi> and preetaosted toast tastes funny
<Buytoast> We can handle a little tab.
<KrazyNoobs> Australia is best because of the spiders.
<Buytoast> Uncle Sam will see us through.
<Polydunami> But Equestria isn't a nudist beach... is it? O_O
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You mean like we "saved" those people in Iran?
<thelonecubone> Polydunami: a huge one
<Buytoast> If they die, Uncle Sam willed it.
<pyrocatboy> Buytoast The French helped us with the Revolutionary War.
<Buytoast> LIAR
<RainbowDashSavior> Anyone here from Perth?
<Sabershy> Polydunami: We... have... fur...?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Buytoast: we also got the white house destroyed by the canadians.
<taoumi> kay bak to dragons nest. fun game that
<Polydunami> Well, that's better
<Polydunami> I mean, warmer
<Buytoast> So the Canadians are our enemies as well now?
<Buytoast> damn you Communism.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> HELL NOW
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So....stream or is the fire going to be on all night
<Kipkat07_Scarf> *NO
<Polydunami> Canadi-what now?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Oh hell naw
<pyrocatboy> Kipkat Don't mess with the Canadians, they will kick your ass.
<Sabershy> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: Fire. I hope fire.
<RainbowDashSavior> fuck Communism
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I liek canada ;~;
<twilight_sprinkle> but seriously, all countries as all people are equal.
<Buytoast> The Communist Terrorists will not win so easily.
<Buytoast> We will destroy them.
<Buytoast> And we will be victorious.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: except for those damn hippies. loljk
<twilight_sprinkle> when people start imagining inequalities, thats where aaaalll the problems start
<killerpony7733> Sounds like a job for liberty prime eh Buytoast?
<KrazyNoobs> Australia tends to avoid conflict.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Welp, saying this now, We're gonna die by nuclear war
<Kipkat07_Scarf> probably
<Polydunami> It's NUCULAR.
<Polydunami> :P
<pyrocatboy> Buytoast jeez, Communist Terrorist, what else are they, Nazis?
<Buytoast> The Nazis have already lost you silly goose.
<Buytoast> Uncle Sam deemed them unworthy.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Also I hate Obama's wife she is so retarded
<KrazyNoobs> Now are we talking about Nazis? O_o
<Kipkat07_Scarf> My political views align heavily with socialism
<RainbowDashSavior> agreed spade
<Buytoast> And we don't need a Liberty Prime.
<Buytoast> We need only Uncle Sam.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> She has crap like suggesting to recycle old stuff to give as gifts
<Buytoast> And our MURIKAN spirit.
<Major> Allo
<pyrocatboy> Buytoast and apple pie.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Or eat healthy, when she has a fucking gigantic ass
<Polydunami> Hey there, Major
<RainbowDashSavior> Socialism would be good if it worked.. but it doesn't
<thelonecubone> ohai Major
<twilight_sprinkle> i like the theory of communism/ socialism, dunno if it can actually realized
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Major
<Kipkat07_Scarf> twilight_sprinkle: It would, but the people would need to let it work.

<KrazyNoobs> Please, let's not start about this.
<RainbowDashSavior> udonsay?
<KrazyNoobs> conversation ENDED
<Polydunami> Hey, look! Shizuka is building a house!
<Polydunami> http://minecraft.vortalcord.net/
<gold> yay fire place!
<KrazyNoobs> gold: You enjoying its warmth?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Good news My dad might get me minecraft
<KrazyNoobs> Gee, it SURE is boring around here. *waits for response*
<KrazyNoobs> Nah, nevermind.
<KrazyNoobs> Not many people are a fan of that anymore.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Mai boi this peace is what all true warriors strive for
<KrazyNoobs> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: :D
<KrazyNoobs> SpadeKyurem[WoW]: I just wonder what Ganon is up too.
<KrazyNoobs> *to
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I keep clicking on ShizuKlaus thinking I can drag her around
<Polydunami> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbxgYlcNxE8
<RainbowDashSavior> what happens when i drag her onto my task bar
<KrazyNoobs> Your majesty. Ganon's minions have seized the island of Coridie
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> It is written only Link can defeat Ganon
<RainbowDashSavior> Im going to Gentoolon to seek the triforce of wisdom
<Kipkat07_Scarf> KrazyNoobs: how boring is it?'
<KrazyNoobs> Hmmm... how can we help?
<lolcatformer> So warm.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Great! I'll grab my stuff!
<KrazyNoobs> It says here, only LINK can defeat Ganon.
<RainbowDashSavior> your sword is enough
<RainbowDashSavior> MAHBOI
<KrazyNoobs> Wow, look at those heads!
<KrazyNoobs> These, Link, are the faces, of EVIL.
<RainbowDashSavior> THESE, ARE THE FACES OF EVILL
<ShizuKlaus> 13lul just realized you can't see the fireplace from the iso angle
<KrazyNoobs> My SHIP sails in the mornin'. (inb4 :D)
<RainbowDashSavior> but father, what if something happens to you?
<KrazyNoobs> Is this a looped portion or an entire video?
<KrazyNoobs> I WONDER WHAT'S FOR DINNER!!!
<Polydunami> Entire video is looped
<KrazyNoobs> Thought so, it seems the wood has not undergone any change from the start of the video to the finish.
<RainbowDashSavior> lol
<KrazyNoobs> But still, it is nice video.
<Kimori> night
<KrazyNoobs> Very warm
<Kimori> going to go shower, will bbl
<Afflict> k
<Polydunami> I see villages to the west and to the east.
<KrazyNoobs> I love how the video uses a pile of wood at the bottom centre, and the fire in the complete centre, while having a rectangular brick wall surrounding 3 sides of it. Very relaxing that way. :)
<RarityisBestPony> I love fire
<Major> On a scale of 1 - 10 how badly do you think Wrek would want this? http://fav.me/d4xm9b0
<Polydunami> Observing thy handiwork

<Polydunami> What I'm wondering is why this picture is labeled as mature content. There's nothing remotely offensive about it.
<RainbowDashSavior> do i actually have to sign up to view it?
<KrazyNoobs> I hope S3E11 - 13 is an epic three-parter. (not confirmed yet, not a rumor yet, NOT A SPOILER)
<Sabershy> Way to cover your ass, KrazyNoobs.. :D
<Polydunami> I'm kind of skeptical about that idea, anyway.
<KrazyNoobs> Sabershy: :D
<Polydunami> Also, let's not talk about it
<Major> Polydunami, probably because its a maid outfit *shrugs* :/
<RainbowDashSavior> il be watching ponies on the Oculus Rift when that comes out : )
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Well i'm going to sleep, Goodnight everyone

<Phase4> 00,02Havok, "it's great because i can change core opperating system files to make it more like the old one" is not a valid reason to like an opperating system
<XAX> Phase4: I want voice for Christmas .-.
<XAX> lol
<Phase4> 00,02DaringDerpy, christmas is on the 25th :/
<SantaTheDuck> Phase4, 2 more hours \:3/

<XAX> Phase4: Please I need a quote for my e-peen
<XAX> >_>
<DaringDerpy> in germany, we get the gifts on the afternoon or early evening of the 24.12.

<SantaTheDuck> Goodnight Moo - damnit >.>
<KrazyNoobs> I'm back
<KrazyNoobs> Just watched an entire Holiday Movie with my mom...
<Gold_Dereindeer> It's the same with my family. We open all our presents on Christmas Eve, and then in the morning Christmas Day we open the presents from Santa Claus. :>
<Gold_Dereindeer> At least it was when I still lived with my mom, lol XD
<SantaTheDuck> Anyway, I bet my family thinks that all masculinity I had left is now gone :$ http://i.imgur.com/QraNO.jpg
<SantaTheDuck> I think they now know I like ponies >.>
<KrazyNoobs> Yeah, Christmas sucked this year... my parents split up 3 days ago, so Christmas was truely crappy this year. :(
<Jmo> You were never a man in the first place Adam.
<Jmo> geddirite.
<SantaTheDuck> Jmo, oh you :P
<ouo> in soviet russia we aint celebrate christmas :S Only new year, and i'm sitting at work and hate my live, i want to get drunk with my bear already
<ouo> kidding i have no bear :\
<XAX> Getting drunk with a head would be awesome.
<Gold_Dereindeer> Ohai Mojay! :D
<XAX> WITH A BEAR
<Jmo> Allo Dema
<DaringDerpy> Дед Мороз
<XAX> When has autocorrect ever helped someone.

<ouo> i miss him
<DaringDerpy> you have a bear?
<Gold_Dereindeer> Is it a panda bear? 8D
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good morning everyone :)
<ouo> DaringDerpy, OF COURSE!
<SantaTheDuck> Mornin' MLP_Brovakiin
<KrazyNoobs> My mom knew I was a Brony, and bought me A Very Minty Christmas (some G3 sh--). She doesn't know I saw it yet, what DO I DO!?
<DaringDerpy> :)
<KrazyNoobs> btw, i hate g3
<SantaTheDuck> KrazyNoobs, burn it.
<Jmo> You accepted it you twit.
<SantaTheDuck> With hugs \:3/
<KrazyNoobs> AdamTheDuck: LOL
<DaringDerpy> like...the government issued personal whales the fins get?
*SantaTheDuck throws a present at Jmo :P
<ouo> we're all have bears here :S
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhHVHhN7guQ&t=2m28s WHO LET THE HORSES OUT
<KrazyNoobs> Oh, and she also got me some G4 welovefine shirts. It would be safe to tell her the G3 sucked, but I will tell her I love the shirts, because, of course, I do.
<DaringDerpy> mailorder business really sucks right now. no one orders anything anymore since a week ago
<KrazyNoobs> She got me a 20% cooler shirt and a red 20% cooler hoodie, along with a Pinkieception shirt. :)
<KrazyNoobs> brb, gonna go thank the crap outta her
<DaringDerpy> something is wrong with this chat. the app freezes every few hours
<Phase4> 00,02DaringDerpy, yeah, lightirc isnt the most stable of clients
<Phase4> 00,02but theres technicall reasons why we use it
<XAX> DaringDerpy: If I were on the PC, I would give you a nice cracked version of mIRC.
<XAX> >for Christmas
<DaringDerpy> I have one, XAX
<Phase4> 00,02why mIRC? hexchat is free
<ouo> desmon the moon bear
<Phase4> 00,02hexchat > mIRC
<DaringDerpy> but...I want it with the stream and all
<XAX> Phase4: b-but... muh paid client
<Phase4> 00,02free and cross platform
<DaringDerpy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQnU5nSReNA a typical day in soviet russia
*Phase4 00,02scoffs at XAX and is purchased software
<Gold_Dereindeer> lol
<KrazyNoobs> IRC is interesting, I love how customable it is
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhHVHhN7guQ&t=7m07s ALLONS-Y
<ouo> lol
<ouo> i love g1
<XAX> Phase4: Thanks for Christmas gift. because implying I'll get anything better than voice in an irc channel.
<Phase4> 00,02the irc protocol is quite simple
<XAX> ohwait I'm getting a laptop if I can pick one.
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, you could start your own channel
<XAX> Phase4: 2lazy
<Phase4> 00,02but its litterally /join [channel that does not yet exist]
<ouo> +v My pingas is sized of god -v
<XAX> Phase4: Yeah, I know. I just don't want to be the one guy "Join my channel join my channel hey have you seen me channel you should join it"
<Phase4> 00,02if you're feeling slightly less lazy you can bug BotServ and have it attach a chanserv to your channel
<KrazyNoobs> Phase4: Type in, /msg ChanServ REGISTER #[channel that doesnt exist yet], and it's ALL yours
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, thats the bit i don't get, how channels get users
<Phase4> 00,02KrazyNoobs, i forgot about that XD
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhHVHhN7guQ&t=5m20s lolwat
<Phase4> 00,02only ever made one and it's not used for much
<KrazyNoobs> Yeah, it is a subfunction of PonyChat.
<KrazyNoobs> PonyChat is fairly advanced, in my opinion.
<XAX> Phase4: dsauce happened from mass invite and the people that came never clicked quit I guess >_>
<Phase4> 00,02by 'not used for much' i meen its there for BerryPunch to join and dump kick messages
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, that can also happen
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhHVHhN7guQ&t=5m58s WAT
<KrazyNoobs> Although when you create your own IRC channels as a sub-channel of PonyChat, I use mIRC to customize them a bit.
<XAX> Phase4: Thinkpads are the only laptop computers are allowed on the international space station.
<DaringDerpy> lobbyism
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, ...why?
<XAX> Phase4: I dunno. Because MUH IBM?
<KrazyNoobs> With mIRC, you can use color (which I will not do at the moment, because it is against the rules. Ctrl + K, you know)
<Phase4> 00,02i meen thinkpads arent bad laptops but still... why
<XAX> They look pretty solid.
<Phase4> 00,02IBM doesnt own the thinkpad trademark anymore
<DaringDerpy> this will not change before we have private spaceflight
<Phase4> 00,02sold it to lenovo
<XAX> oh.
<XAX> what does IBM do now then? :|
<Phase4> 00,02while they are a bit more expencive, before being sold thinkpads were exceptional laptops
<XAX> >zecoya
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, buisness and high performance computing
<Phase4> 00,02plus some other things
<KrazyNoobs> Oh, and we have a name for S3E10! :) (i will not say it... you know... spoilers?)
<Phase4> 00,02they're still heavilly into research, as evident by watson and other such machines
<XAX> Phase4: I've heard about the zecoya or whatever it is. Other than that, nothing else.
<ouo> a good thing about ibm notebooks is trackpad
<ouo> and they have it on lenovo
<Phase4> 00,02"In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program Watson, [...]" it's funny because watson isn't an ai
<XAX> A cool think about thinkpads is the clitoramouse on the keyboard.
<XAX> ...as its called.
<Phase4> 00,02it's a fancy search engine
<KrazyNoobs> XAX: I hate that thing...
<KrazyNoobs> THING
<Phase4> colour off
<Uboa-San> I'm Badk
<Phase4> XAX, https://xkcd.com/243/
<Uboa-San> Back*
<XAX> Phase4 powered down.
*KrazyNoobs eyes are burning from too much white
<Phase4> ouo, older thinkpads were built really well, cast aliminum frames and everything
<Gold_Dereindeer> LOL Nipple mouse. XD
<XAX> Phase4: lel'd
<ouo> yeah ibm was better
<Phase4> IBM's also doing a bit of hardware research
<Phase4> look up 'Racetrack Memory'
<Uboa-San> Brb, again
<Mutterguy> Merry XAXmas!
<KrazyNoobs> cya Uboa-san
<XAX> Phase4: How did you conjure up that comic link so fast? .-.
<Phase4> really wierd type of memory, stores information magnetically on a loop of metal, putting current through the metal causes the magnetization to move along the path
<Phase4> XAX, google
<Mutterguy> see what I did there
<XAX> Mutterguy: HA! You too c:
<Phase4> XAX, neat trick: xkcd keeps the comic text in an invisible div, google indexes the contents of that div
<Phase4> you can google xkcd comics by their text
<XAX> Phase4: >magnets
<KrazyNoobs> ThinkPadState.net
<XAX> how do they work
<Phase4> XAX, via some really wierd math
<Phase4> really wierd math that no one explains right
<XAX> Phase4: Did you see that programming language comic I linked you on steam from /g/?
<Phase4> yeah
<XAX> Is it accurate? x3
<Phase4> i actually replied in steam :P
<XAX> I didn't see. :c
<Phase4> link it again and i'll remake the reply
<KrazyNoobs> well, brb in half an hour
<XAX> b-but... the thread probably 404d, and I'm off MUH PC...
<XAX> I'll try find it...
<Phase4> its a cyanide and something comic
<Phase4> i forget what its called
<aniderp|bestcakeever> SuperChristmas64: did you see the picture?
<SuperChristmas64> 11,02aniderp|bestcakeever: Yesh :3 It was cool :)
<Gold_Dereindeer> Hi aniderp|bestcakeever =D
<SuperChristmas64> 11,02I sent a reply :D
<SantaTheDuck> Ohai aniderp|bestcakeever
<aniderp|bestcakeever> wait...
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> hm
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> dang to long..
<XAX> Phase4: http://cdn.churchm.ag/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/if-programming-languages-were-essays1-620x1596.jpg It's missing C# with the funny faces on it and one other
<Gold_Dereindeer> Aww
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> was gonna be best fruitcake ever
<Gold_Dereindeer> You will just have to be best fruitcak. :>
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> fine
<Phase4> XAX, PHP
<Phase4> TO GOOGLE!
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> you saw all 4 slides?
<XAX> Phase4: I found it on /g/. It might have been edited there. >le 4chan exclusive face
<Phase4> i've seen the edited comic before
<Phase4> the smaller one is just more common
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> 2 new notes
<Mutterguy> Secret Santa resulted me having +1 pony. Hasbro's combs are terrible.
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/nEY5d
<Phase4> ^ true story
<SantaTheDuck> Phase4, ... so true...
<ouo> oh lol
<ouo> so true about java
<Phase4> programing is still a young discipline, we're still figuring out the best ways to build things
<Phase4> and i totally didnt have to google discipline >_>
<Phase4> ouo, true about most all languages, java just sucks
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> thanks SuperChristmas64
<ouo> all languages have ridiculous things :D
<ouo> because peoples made them
<XAX> Phase4: MUH connection drop
<XAX> Find it?
<Phase4> nope
<XAX> Phase4: :c
<Phase4> critisizing programing languages can be dificult because you always have some jerk who things the language is awesome
<Phase4> and comes up with things llike "a good programer can work in any language'
<ouo> also that greatest trolling about 'functional and imperative' way to programming :D
<Phase4> and as i said, young discipline, lots of opinion still
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> i'm still working out the distinction betwene the two
<XAX> Phase4: >C#
<XAX> http://ponilauta.fi/int/src/13303713909052.png/pinkie_pie%20yaranaika.png
<ouo> C# java
<Phase4> XD
<Phase4> C# > java but thats not exactly dificult
<ouo> really honestly i never seen good interface on java
<XAX> Phase4: Is there a "hardest" language?
<ouo> without bugs
<XAX> >assembly
<XAX> >machine code
<Phase4> XAX, define hardest
<ouo> and always is so slow
<ouo> as fuck
<XAX> Phase4: don't know shit captain
<Phase4> well theres esoteric languages like brainfuck
<Phase4> theres a reason its called that btw
<XAX> lol.
<XAX> Who would make that...
<ouo> ikr :D And it turing complete
<Phase4> XAX, some guy, was essentially for teh lulz
<Phase4> wanted to see how small a vm he could make
<ouo> why not
<XAX> Phase4: Did he completely finish it and use it in something? .-.
<Phase4> 200bytes later he had brainfuck
<ouo> i love do some code with turing machine :D
<ouo> for fun
<Phase4> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck
<Phase4> XAX, its REALLY small, 8 opcodes
<ouo> also The Emperor new mind
<ouo> greatest book i think
<ouo> i ever read
<Phase4> should read that
<ouo> my father give it too me
<ouo> he such a great man... i hope i'll be him sometime
<Phase4> i plan to impliment brainfuck using mod_rewrite to prove that its turing complete
<ouo> sounds fun :D
<Phase4> i've got the HOW figured, but getting around to writing it is a diffrent matter
<Phase4> lots of fiddly regex
<Phase4> also just Try and do math in mod_rewrite, its insane
<XAX> Phase4: lol examples on wiki. That code just to print "hello world"
<Gold_Dereindeer> And now it's time for me to get ready for Christmas. See y'all Wednesday, Bronystate.
<Phase4> XAX, yeah XD, its got to incriment until it gets the value of each char
<Phase4> later Gold_Dereindeer
<Phase4> Turing-completness is such an interesting concept
<Phase4> if something is turing-complete it could in theory simulate a universe, given enough time and memory
<Phase4> also if you manage to write a universe simulator in brainfuck then you win life
<Serenity> Hey everypont..okay then, Phase4
<Phase4> ohai Serenity
<SantaTheDuck> Ohai Serenity
<Phase4> also this is beautifull http://www.google.com/doodles/alan-turings-100th-birthday
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Serenity :)
<Phase4> its a turing machine : D
<Serenity> Reinforcement arrives, and Phase just says about universal stuffs
*Serenity noms on cake
<XAX> Phase4: http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/30106013
<Phase4> Serenity, we were talking about turing-completeness, by which i meen i was talking and the channel was otherwise silent
<Phase4> XAX, apple and MS refused to suport webm
<Uboa-San> Back!
<Phase4> i imagine the mpeg consortium were around with some big cheques, just to be safe
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Uboa-San :)
<Phase4> plus the whole DRM thing which is a faulty argument either way
<Serenity> Wow, wow....just...wow
<Phase4> i'd be ok with everything suporting h264 but there are licencing issues which prevent firefox from doing so
<Serenity> Just realised I could zoom in thr webpage and I get better display on this website
<Phase4> Serenity, o_O
*Serenity facedesks into his cake
<Serenity> Originally, I had a lot of spare space
<XAX> Phase4: I don't even get it but I lol'd at the squabbling http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/30104172
<Phase4> i'm certin they are trolling
<Chrysalis> hai guys
<Phase4> well, some of them are trolling
<Phase4> ohai Chrysalis
<ouo> meh i'm too lazy to programming for money
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai Chrysalis :)
<ouo> so i do it fun :D
<ouo> then i'm not lazy :\
<Chrysalis> hai Phase4 and MLP_Brovakiin
<SantaTheDuck> Ohai Chrysalis
<Serenity> Lua is pretty confusing at first
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> im the best fruit cak ever!
<Serenity> Mainly because organisation is a HUGE issue
<XAX> Phase4: I figured, because 4chan.
<ouo> so i got many not complete pieces of code on random languages :D
<ouo> but it's still fun
<Chrysalis> Lua is quite an easy language as far as scripting is concerned
<Phase4> Lua feels like its for a certin type of software that i just never seem to use
<Phase4> as such i've never actually used it
<Serenity> It is, compared to a lot, but you have to remember all the tabbing after the if statements and such
<Chrysalis> Phase4: use computercraft in minecraft
<Chrysalis> lua controlled turtles <3
<Serenity> Chrysalis: Yeah, that's basically my full use of Lua
<ouo> turtles!
<Phase4> Chrysalis, i was actually looking at using redpower computers
<Phase4> 6502 FTW!
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> who likes fruit cake? :P
<Phase4> aniderp|bestfruitcak, /)
<Chrysalis> Phase4: also good, RP is 1.4.6
<Serenity> Phase4: That uses BIOS, doesn't it!?
<Chrysalis> and is in the DW20 pack on FTB
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> im the best ever!
<Phase4> Serenity, o_O
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> im sooo good :P
<ouo> Also Scala is new and hipster
<Chrysalis> Serenity: yes it does, it fully emulates the CPU
<ouo> ifyouknowwhatimean
<Chrysalis> which is how you can get entirely new OS's for it
<Phase4> FORTH is a really wierd language
<Phase4> at the same time its kinda neat
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> guiys... wish me luck about getting pony and zelda stuff tommorow!
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> and maybe pokemon
<Serenity> Chrysalis: Seen Star wars on FComputercraft?
<XAX> http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/30106018#p30106404 lol
<Chrysalis> yup
<ouo> i'm never tried it
<Serenity> You need a tonne of monitors, but in creative it's fine
<Chrysalis> <3ing the new updates to redpower. tubes in frames. the world will never be the same :D
<Serenity> Actually, what's the difference between a normal computer and an advanced computer?
<Chrysalis> colour
<ouo> also i love PDP assembler, this is so neat and fun!
<Serenity> Chrysalis: Colour? That's it?
<Chrysalis> the advanced ones have the ability to change background and text colour
<ouo> bad thing
<Chrysalis> yup
<Serenity> Ahhhh
<Phase4> i want to write a PDP emulator
<Serenity> I thought you just meant the golden case colour
<Phase4> got bored when it turned out theres a lot of different PDP's and boot disks are anoying to find :(
<Serenity> Phase4: Can't you just copy/pasta some code?
<Phase4> uh... not sure what you meen
<Serenity> Phase4: If you're still talking about minecraft (knowing my luck, you aren't)
<ouo> nah he aint talkin about minecraft...
<Phase4> PDP emulator in minecraft would be godly
<ouo> lawl
<Chrysalis> Phase4: enjoy :P
<ouo> i wnat to see it :D
<Phase4> actually... wonder how hard it'd be to build a PDP in minecraft
<Serenity> Java probably couldn't handle it
<ouo> Phase4 do it do it do it
<Phase4> redpower makes it a lot denser
<Chrysalis> the hard part would be balancing how much to do a tick
<ouo> i want it "D
<Serenity> Thing is with me, the only thing that keeps Minecraft installed on my system, never mind play it is mods
<Chrysalis> as soon as you get any amount of automation TPS drops
<Chrysalis> oh yeah
<Chrysalis> vanilla is so far behind what the modders are putting out
<Serenity> They've got so much shit to do if they are gonna get someone who played since Alpha 1.0.0 back
<aniderp|bestfruitcak> who wants a peice of me? :P

<ouo> i hate notch for java, but i love him for beard
<Serenity> I feel bad for Dinnerbone, he had to fuck around for a week to try and fix that shitty lighting bug, in vain
<Serenity> Lighting isn't even that hard to code in a game like that!
<ouo> really someone tell me about one interface app on java without shit glitches in it
<ouo> and it's mostly slow as hell

<ouo> IAlreadyStoned
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j4t185wl-0
<ouo> some classic need here
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> AI - Already Intoxicated
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> it's a concept film about the philosophical implications of robots becoming self-aware by experimenting with viruses that act like drugs
<cowvarkian> sounds fun
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> but in the end, cell phones become the dominant movers and shakers in the market, crushing PCs
<cowvarkian> ya mean like now
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> so in the future, everyone satisfies their sexual urges with tiny semiconductor cubes that emit holograms
<Chrysalis> DoYouWantToGetHigh: That is a horrific future
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> it's like THX 1138, but without the creepy dick vacuum and blad dancing black people in the nude
<Chrysalis> phone are an abomination now
<Serenity> I hate phonwa
<Serenity> phones*
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> exactly
<Chrysalis> but they will never replace desktops
<cowvarkian> or will they
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> it's also a nod to how the illuminati's power can be bought and sold through wars
<cowvarkian> DUN DUN DUUUUNNN
<Chrysalis> nope
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> photonics > everything
<Chrysalis> cause a phone can never be as powerful as a desktop
<cowvarkian> hey look, insane conspiracy theories
<Serenity> The most portable computer is a PDA
<cowvarkian> those still exist?
<Serenity> They aren't bad, but they are outdated as fuck
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> it's not insane
*SantaTheDuck puts on a tinfoil hat
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> it's accurate
<alexxm> hey guys
<SantaTheDuck> Ohai alexxm
<Serenity> Heya, alexxm
<Chrysalis> screw portable
<Chrysalis> i want power
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> hey santaduck you'll be better off trepanatng
<alexxm> how are things SantaTheDuck and Serenity
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: so, illumaniti existing/ running everything from behind a meta physical curtain, isn't insane?
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> the CIA made a brain scanner thatcuts through aluminum by excavating alien tech from Hell
<Serenity> My internet deserves to die for being slow, other than that, fine
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> not at all
<SantaTheDuck> alexxm, quite fine, 15 minutes till Christmas but I opened my presents early anyway :$'
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> it's more sensible to think that our right's haven't eroded completely
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> HA HA HA HA HA HA
<Serenity> SantaTheDuck: Where do ya live?
<SantaTheDuck> Serenity, Australia :P
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> *than thinking
<Serenity> Oh, of course
<Chrysalis> australia, cheating at christmas since timezones
<Serenity> The aussies are 11 hours ahead of Brits right now
<EspyLacopa> So, we streaming the animaniacs marathon tonight?
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> Australia > New Zealand
<Chrysalis> there are no official streams for the entire holiday period
<cowvarkian> New Zealand > Australia
<Serenity> Bronystate will be inactive tommorow
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> no, the zels are britfags
<Serenity> I'll probably log on, but only on my iPad
<Chrysalis> ewww ipad
<XAX> Phase4: >this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8qgehH3kEQ
<Serenity> DoYouWantToGetHigh: Australians are britfags
<Serenity> Oh shit, I'm a britfag
<SantaTheDuck> britfags? .-.
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> um I was implying that new zealand has a greater attachment to the UK than australia
<Chrysalis> this is not a bad thing
<Serenity> I was speaking historically
<Serenity> At least the NZ's spell correctly :p
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> look at events like the falkland island war and kultur of the two states
<Serenity> colour, honour, humour
<Chrysalis> Serenity: +1 to that
<cowvarkian> hey look, correct spellings of things
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> >implying English is inherently correct only in GB
<Chrysalis> yes
<Chrysalis> thats because english is from england
<Chrysalis> not bastard english
<Chrysalis> aka american english
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: well I spelt like that, in the US, when I was in 4th grade and told I was wrong
<cowvarkian> so, yes it is correct
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> you disregard the fact that language assumes regional differences
<cowvarkian> yes, yes I do
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> it is only correct as per the region of imposition
<EspyLacopa> What about that stuff they speak in what's it called. Welsh.
<Chrysalis> you assume that being somewhere else means it can be different
<Chrysalis> if its named the same, it should be the same
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> thus i reject your complex of long gone british supremacy
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> your empire is a mere commonwealth tackered to the States
<Chrysalis> LAWl
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: by spelling incorrectly and spouting insane bullshit?
<Chrysalis> someones living in the middle ages
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> no, im living after WWII
<cowvarkian> I'm sure you are
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> else i wouldn't be present
*Chrysalis facepalms
<Chrysalis> someone REALLY doesnt get it
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> memes are an acceptable alternative to spoilt patriotism
<cowvarkian> lelwat
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> NOT
<Serenity> When you think, it's the other way around. We have a ruler, yet all the Americans are under common wealth
<cowvarkian> true
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> it's a federal system with 50 political subdivisions
<cowvarkian> though your ruler is a bit of a tacked on figure head now
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> not a confederacy of aligned states
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> maybe if the South won
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> sure
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> but not in this world
<cowvarkian> >_ >
<XAX> Am I the only one that thinks the title of the next poni episode is absolutely_distgusting.jpg?
<cowvarkian> !cd
<Tom> Episode 10 of season 3 "Spike at Your Service" airs in 5 days, 2 hours, 36 minutes, 41 seconds (Dec 29 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Serenity> Hmm?
<cowvarkian> no
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> Spike at yer service
<Serenity> Oh my
<cowvarkian> I like the title
<XAX> Oh.
<Chrysalis> considering how bad hasbro are at naming episodes
<XAX> The one after that...
<Chrysalis> they should be classed as spoilers now
<XAX> not the spike one...
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> didn't see it
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> does it involve things near or within RD?
<cowvarkian> I hope not
<XAX> DoYouWantToGetHigh: >within
<XAX> lol.
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> nu ha ha ha ha
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> made you laff
<cowvarkian> you're welcome
<Serenity> That was an extremely random topic change
<cowvarkian> as most should be
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> American empire: 1 Commonwealth skeleton: zip
<cowvarkian> oh yeah, we are an empire, aren't we
<Chrysalis> american empire?
<Chrysalis> you do realise no one likes you right?
<cowvarkian> yeah
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> nor you for that matter
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> that's the price of being WASPS i guess
<Serenity> The thing that annoys me most about the American side of things, is the fact that most people in Britiain are English and use Americanism
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> Britain is americanised
<Chrysalis> Serenity: it works both ways, there are alot of britishisms that are used in america
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> your nation has suckled upon th teat ever since the Nais reigned Hell
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> *Nazis
<cowvarkian> http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14201796
<Serenity> Chrysalis: Must be pretty damn rare, 'cuz I hardly see it :/
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> at least we have two oceans surrounding our borders
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> doesn't stop la raza tho
<cowvarkian> britain is an island
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> goddamned attrition conflicts
<Chrysalis> cowvarkian: i have heard none of them actually used
<cowvarkian> well I don't live in the UK, so I wouldn't know
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> anglo-amerikan kultur exchange is like those odd cases where you're friends with a woman who had an abortion in college
<Chrysalis> yeah, no one actually uses those in real conversation
<moonslicer> hi everypony
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> you have this feeling you understand why she's so unsettled at coat hanger jokes
<Chrysalis> there are so many things wrong with what you just said
<cowvarkian> moonslicer: leave while you still can
<Chrysalis> hi moonslicer
<moonslicer> why cowvarkian abd hi chrysalis
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> Greetings moonslicer.

<moonslicer> cowvarkian i can handle this...
<moonslicer> after all... im the biggist troll on the internet well my friends say so
<cowvarkian> good
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> you see, people who take the "you were fun" approach are just inwardly compounding their own disgust and putrid constipation of better responses
<cowvarkian> thats nice
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> not for you
<cowvarkian> cool story
<moonslicer> ok ok break it up maybe if you can just start over!
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> brool story co
<SantaTheDuck> Merry Christmas Phase4 :P
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> I don't think the majority of the bron y community can release grudges.
*cowvarkian doesn't get grudges
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> despite their indoctrination of ideals
<moonslicer> "whatever"
<ouo> http://imgur.com/QmNmp
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> they still take things rather personally
<cowvarkian> though you'll probably say I do
<alexxm> i don't hold grudges
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> denial is not just a river in egypt
<SlenderManWoods> this makes me think of warm thoughts
<moonslicer> its also a feeling
<cowvarkian> so, how bout those ponies
<SlenderManWoods> awesome
<ouo> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33eKeMbgCok
<cowvarkian> also, inb4 eww ponies

<DoYouWantToGetHigh> I like Story of the Blanks.
<ouo> i fried knot
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> Why aren't there more things like Story of the Blanks?
<cowvarkian> because you touch yourself at night
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> with your significant other, yes
<cowvarkian> and because I don't have a real answer
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: of which I have none
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> boo hoo
<moonslicer> MY GOSH YOU TWO BREAK IT UP
<SlenderManWoods> story of the blanks is how i got into this
<cowvarkian> no, just destroying the joke
<cowvarkian> moonslicer: never had one
<moonslicer> ...
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> you did a poor deconstruction
<moonslicer> TROLOLOLOL
<Jmo> Na, keep going. This is humorous.
<cowvarkian> ikr jaymoo
<moonslicer> grrrrrr
<moonslicer> * bites self *
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> well, it appears the anger is surging through jack cowavarkian
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> make sure to milk those udders
<cowvarkian> lelwat... anger
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> wouldn't want you to piss and moan more
<SlenderManWoods> zombie ponies are the best, and zombie pinkamena is awesome
<cowvarkian> pretty sure I'm not angry
<XAX> Night gentlemen. Merry birthmas.
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> if you weren't, you would disregard this
<moonslicer> ok how about you two strip naked and run around saying im from the future!
<cowvarkian> I'm up for that
<SlenderManWoods> lol
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> sorry, im not gay
<cowvarkian> I'm sure you aren't
<moonslicer> im not gay im a girl
<moonslicer> nor am i a lesbian
<SlenderManWoods> sure you are
<moonslicer> ...
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> people who openly mock others for admitting their sexual orientation most likely have issues maintianing their own
<moonslicer> your kidding right>
<SlenderManWoods> how did you know
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: but I wasn't mocking
<moonslicer> i fell in love with someone called micheal to bad my friend chelsiea too him away!
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> you were appyling sarcasm
<SlenderManWoods> i dont smoke
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: as I do to most things
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> which is indeed a method of insulting another
<cowvarkian> doesn't mean I was mocking
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> i doubt that
<cowvarkian> well I wasn't mocking
<ouo> They'll never catch up.﻿ NCIS has two guys on one keyboard, but little do they know that the hackers have three guys on one mouse.
<ouo> :D
<cowvarkian> you might percieve it as that though
<moonslicer> do i have to look at a fireplace for ten more hours?
<cowvarkian> sure
<SlenderManWoods> yep
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> if you're so sarcastic, what reason do i have in believing anything you say
<moonslicer> hey hey i got a joke!
<ouo> moonslicer, do you like bananas?
<moonslicer> no
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: none, you don't have to
<ouo> why
<moonslicer> im not a fruit person
<ouo> they yum actually
<moonslicer> i hate fruit
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> then how can i judge your claims accordingly
<SlenderManWoods> i love apples
<ouo> i like bananas
<ouo> and bacon
<moonslicer> Hey i got a joke!
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> oh well, im reading too far anyhow
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: *shrug*
<alexxm> ouo put them together
<ouo> i sure do
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> apathy is not an excuse for insincerity
<cowvarkian> ok
<moonslicer> what happens when a dragon lands on two people argueing!?
<cowvarkian> I really don't care
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> what's okay?
<cowvarkian> you're statement
<cowvarkian> *your
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> you seem like you do
<SlenderManWoods> hmmm
<moonslicer> anyone know?
<ouo> moonslicer, seks?
<moonslicer> no
<ouo> well i pass
<cowvarkian> death?
<ouo> death seks?
<moonslicer> Nothing! because the two people argueing would be turned into pancakes!!
<cowvarkian> so, death
<ouo> zombie seks
<Jmo> ouo, Keep that shit out.
<moonslicer> * troll face *
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> but nothing implies that the arguers states haven't changed at all
<SlenderManWoods> ya, pancakes, woohoo
<Yahooz> moonslicer: dohoho you really got me there :p
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> so how can they be pancakes
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> is the dragon a worm hole from another universe?
<cowvarkian> its a joke
<cowvarkian> they commonly use exageration
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> aren't jokes supposed to be funny
<cowvarkian> it's a staple
<moonslicer> if the dragon was fat then two ponys would not be able to lift it
<moonslicer> if the dragon was heavy
<ouo> i just have a picture from Dead Alive movie :D
<moonslicer> theres your dragon pancake maker!
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> so the debaters are ponies?
<moonslicer> my brother is half dragon half pony
<SlenderManWoods> everythings a pony
<cowvarkian> lel dat bad OC
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> what subspecies are sad ponies?
<moonslicer> horses
<SlenderManWoods> hmmm
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> if one's a unicorn pony he could stop the dragon with magic
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> but ponies aren't much related to horses
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> moreso to dogs i believe
<ouo> ponies are horses :S
<moonslicer> yea is the dragon sat on a unicorn horn it would break
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> im aware
<moonslicer> damn typos
<SlenderManWoods> lol
<ouo> A pony is a small horse[1][2][3] (Equus ferus caballus). Depending on context, a pony may be a horse that is under an approximate or exact height at the withers, or a small horse with a specific conformation and temperament. There are many different breeds.
<ouo> mhhm
<ouo> last part
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> did you get that from wikipedia
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> because i don't trust wiki
<moonslicer> ok something really weird just got into my mind
<ouo> nope >_>
<SlenderManWoods> he cheated
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> it looks like you left the source note numbers in there
<SlenderManWoods> ha, proof
<moonslicer> you know i said i had a OC thats half dragon half pony right?
<ouo> i have sources
<ouo> in my mind
<cowvarkian> moonslicer: dat bad OC
<moonslicer> no
<cowvarkian> if it's half dragon, that immedietly makes it bad
<cowvarkian> *spelling
<moonslicer> not mine
<cowvarkian> whatever you say, george
<moonslicer> he is nice
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> as bad as twilight possibly beecoming an alicorn?
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: yes, that bad
<moonslicer> ...
<moonslicer> ANYSWAYS
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> finally, something we agree on
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: that if twi became an alicorn the show would be ruined?
<moonslicer> anysways? wtf kind of a word is that
<ouo> mmm
<SlenderManWoods> if i was doing live stream, i would play dead space 1 through 2 , then play dead space 3 when it comes out

<cowvarkian> hey look, wikipedia has that information
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> HQ in Georgia told GmBH to get the fuck out, but GmBH wanted to turn a profit.

<KrazyNoobs> Was supposed to be a trick
<pony_7459> again
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> i mean molesting physics to the point where butterflies can retrieve plummeting unicorns is fun
<KrazyNoobs> Copied that off of my own channel, sorry
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> but reality has a darker humour
<cowvarkian> unless they're made of dark matter, DoYouWantToGetHigh
<pony_7459> trollestia
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> but that would mean they flew out of luna's kunt
<cowvarkian> oh you
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> she was still...recovering
<cowvarkian> they could've flown down from the moon
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> you know, from doing ecstasy and rubbing pipsqueak too much into the carpet
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> the moon was just a large kidney stone of luna's
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> so still luna
<pony_7459> A-well-a everybody's heard about the bird B-b-b-bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word
<cowvarkian> so what, luna was just in rehab for being an alcoholic?
<arcium> Well, this is christmassy :D Hi btw.
<KrazyNoobs> pony_7459: Sorry, what was the word?
<pony_7459> surfin bird
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> you're a different person when you can't get buzzed off twenty prozacs
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> typically yu'd die but not when you're an immortal darkness moon pony god
<KrazyNoobs> pony_7459: It is better if you get someone to ask what the word is

<arcium> Well, i gotago :P Bye! and Merry Christmas!
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> they invaded the moon before we did
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> that's why we filmed the landing because we knew we couldn't touch the surface
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> just ask the ruskies
<ouo> don't ask me :\
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> remember the one that almost died from vacuum pressure?
<cowvarkian> I didn't think that inanimate objects could die
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> Yeah, he just happened to rip open his hermetically sealed suit outside by accident
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> In all srsness, the soviets really ganked their space programme to the macks.
<cowvarkian> ya know what we need?

<DoYouWantToGetHigh> Well, we got one with the Chinese
<cowvarkian> yeah
<cowvarkian> we do a bit
<KrazyNoobs> btw, that trick is pretty annoying, i should stop (not even a trick)
<cowvarkian> except they're out largest trading partner
<cowvarkian> *our
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> thing is, they still have coal dust on their cities
<ouo> cold war c: sounds fun
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> they're their own biggest ally and enemy
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> just imagine what's gunna go down when riots break out over here and the ethnic divisions in China starts to crack open
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> martial law, both ends!
<cowvarkian> then I'll go to *insert name of country that isn't either of those*
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> No snakes alive!
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> good luck
<cowvarkian> theres always canada
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> just before you're passed, theyll pass a quarantine
<ouo> daymn politics :\ never bothered
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> canada
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> ha ha ha
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> yeah, that's place is a death trap
*cowvarkian likes canada
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> *that
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> i mean, you get colon cancer and you're dead
<pony_7459> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzodZc8-sWE
<cowvarkian> wouldn't you normally die if you get colon cancer?
<cowvarkian> not just in canada
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> early stages are reasonably fought
<RaveBrony> Good morning everyone! :)
<cowvarkian> why would I get colon cancer anyways
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> it's at the early signs they give you a 40 percent range
<cowvarkian> hey RaveBrony
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> if it's not one cancer, it's another
<RaveBrony> Happy Christmas Eve :$
<cowvarkian> why would I get A cancer at all
<ouo> cowvarkian, Australia!
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> its incurring agents lie in things we use everyday
<cowvarkian> ouo: too hot
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> not to mention the environs we inhabit
<ouo> i would move here too if some shit starts growing up c:
<ouo> cowvarkian hot but fun! There is so many wonderful creatures
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> canada's just the soft spot on the baby's skull
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> just wait until the russians want more than alaska back
<cowvarkian> lel
<cowvarkian> russia
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> then it'll be split between russian federation the States as resources
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> *and the
<ouo> ah, there is only politics wnat something in any country :S
<ouo> so i don't care
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> the fires of Hell burn hottest for those who do not take sides
<cowvarkian> well hell always did sound like fun
<ouo> indeed!
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> if it even exists
<cowvarkian> all my friends would be there
<cowvarkian> if it exists
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> even then, you'll probably get stuck in some old guys version of heaven
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> try watching ponies there
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> hell is just a state of mind
<cowvarkian> I doubt I would get stuck in any heaven
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> and the grave an eternal thought
<ouo> maybe fire is hot, but i'll be with pitchfork
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> an old man's heaven is a young man's hell
<ouo> if it exists
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> the point is, hell will not be what you think it is. to me, the fear of dying is worse than any hell.
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> especially if you've been at that edge before
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: old man heaven actually sounds fun
<Saturn> 08,01 /win 13
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> your lfe does flash before your eyes
<cowvarkian> good to know
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> and all of that suspended fear and disbelief crashes down
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> i don't like how you belittle that experience
<ouo> DoYouWantToGetHigh, so do science and bring up immortalism already
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: I wasn't
<cowvarkian> I was sincerely saying that it was good to know
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> we won't achieve immortality in our time
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> that is a problem for our children, or what's left of them, to decide
<cowvarkian> you mean the 2 billion or so kids?
<cowvarkian> >_ >
<cowvarkian> <_ <
<Nittany_Discord> I frankly wouldn't want to live forever. Suffer with my problems for eternity? No.
<RaveBrony> Mmmm, living forever? I wish.....
<Serenity> Living forever would suck
<Nittany_Discord> And who's going to keep me up forever? I may not even be able to work.
<Serenity> What if you got a life sentence in prison?
<ouo> also internet did us free in information, there is no boundaries and boxes, if we got somehow fast matter transmission, physical boundaries will be useless too
<cowvarkian> you mean the deconstruction and restruction of particles?
<Nittany_Discord> Living forever is great if you're of perfect mind and body.
<ouo> maybe but i know it's impossible
<RaveBrony> :\
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> i'm talking about the two billion or less people who will be alive once the world has succumbed to war, famine and other strain
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> if vertebrate life still exists after the first ICBM is fired, then science will pose some rather intriguing questions to mankind
<RaveBrony> O_o
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> as always, he will find a way to pervert inquiry to his own ends, replacing question with more inquiry rather than legitimate answers
<cowvarkian> so this is the topic we're getting into now
<cowvarkian> great
<Kandarihu> And immortality isn't worth it if you're alone forever. But if your friends have it too, it'll be great.
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> im not a fan of the gene roddenbury alliance thing
<ouo> aww, you not first who thinking about it...
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: I am...
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> then you're naieve
<cowvarkian> yeah, a bit
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> i didn't say that to be mean, it's just not likely
<cowvarkian> I know
<cowvarkian> I don't take offense easily
<DaringDerpy> hello
<Serenity> The best way to cure imortality is to either jump in lava where it will melt every particle of you, or to give yourself an absolute SHIT TONNE of morphine to make you sleep for a long long time
<cowvarkian> *don't easily take offense
<DaringDerpy> sounds interesting. who are you talking about?
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> cryogenics may be a solution
<cowvarkian> in which statement
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> but that's only been tested on dogs and limited cases of humans
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> not sufficient to sustain persons, and if so, technology can rejuvinate them
<cowvarkian> all your limbs wouldn't work after being frozen that long
<DaringDerpy> http://humanityplus.org/
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> *can't
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> Eugh, transhumanists.
<Serenity> Eventually, you would be able to move
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> Maybe with hydraulic joints
<cowvarkian> true
<ouo> i think there is never be a 3d war, and i bet we never get a fast mattere transportation, the most real think for us - increasing life period
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> otherwise, you'd better not age faster than a rotten pear and have some good life support systems
<Serenity> I still think lava is the best cure for imortality
<Serenity> ouo: 3d war? What about the 3DS?
<ouo> :D
<cowvarkian> or the cold dark depths of space, Serenity
<Serenity> I'm so bored right now
<cowvarkian> then go to sleep
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> there may be a third, fourth and even fifth war
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> shit will have to break like it usually does
<ouo> and dephs of space is bullshit before with our life cycle
<Serenity> I can't go to sleep now, otherwise my sleep patterns of the next year will be affected
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> geopolitick and not enough resources contrive dangerous scenarios
<DaringDerpy> we will see immortality much earlier than world peace
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> immortality for the rich
<cowvarkian> isn't there this wonderful thing called mutually assured destrucion, DoYouWantToGetHigh
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> yes
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> clean again
<DaringDerpy> oh, you're a communist
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> just like God intended
<Serenity> The day scientists find out how to make hearts and spines regenerate will be the day imortality and old dodgerness is cured
<DaringDerpy> "if I can't afford it, it's worth nothing"
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> no, everyone would be too poor to afford immortality
<DaringDerpy> Serenity: hearts are easy
<ouo> communism growing up from capitalism :S But we have never build it right
<ouo> and never will be
<cowvarkian> thats because each time it was attempted, there was no capitalism to grow up from
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> that's the degeneration of socialism
<DaringDerpy> DoYouWantToGetHigh: you know nothing about that
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> about what
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> i dont need to be an aconomics professor to know about history of nations and their politick
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> *an economics
<cowvarkian> *politics
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> i prefer politick and other teutonic expressions
<DaringDerpy> you think you can project the history into the future? you think nations will be relevant in 500 years?
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> yes
<DaringDerpy> please
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> you can't see into a crystal ball
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> most likely,there will be no nations for people to build
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> because there will be no people
<cowvarkian> lel
<Serenity> DoYouWantToGetHigh: Why? It's not cloudy or opague?
<DaringDerpy> you are high, right?
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> not as high as you are
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> i'd not want to drink your kool aid nor smoke your crack
<cowvarkian> dat casual racism
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> dat over the head ignorance
<DaringDerpy> the kid called me a nigger?
<cowvarkian> I think so
<Serenity> Holy jesus
<Serenity> Portal 2 is 11 gig
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> look who's drawing assumptions
<DaringDerpy> americans...
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> eurotrash...
*cowvarkian is an american
<DaringDerpy> discussion completed
<DaringDerpy> :)
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> nice resignation bro
<ouo> but really all grows from basic economic forms, also states (i mean states not US) exists only because peoples lives in some local places, then speed of information transmission starts growing up we got some freedom
<DaringDerpy> no mods here?
<ouo> but we still living at tje local places
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> uh oh, is derpy trying to call the gestapo?
<DaringDerpy> flying has become extremely cheap

<DoYouWantToGetHigh> you didn't answer my question
<CrystalPhoenix> no stream today nor tomorrow because of the holidays
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> if you have a legitimate issue, maybe you should discuss it directly rather than calling in e-favours
<DaringDerpy> DoYouWantToGetHigh: You mean you don't get the answer
<kidzrul732> HEY BRONIES SANTA IS STARTING HIS TRIP AROUND THE WORLD!
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> pussy

<kidzrul732> Serenity: buck yeah!
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> otherwise, ignored
<Serenity> kidzrul732: Oh...About that
<DaringDerpy> you could have told me that earlier, CrystalPhoenix :)
<ouo> flying not an option actually, i mean you can't working in one country and go to sleep in another without huge transportation problem
<Serenity> Last year, around this time, this guy was trying to fit down my chimney, I came down to see what the noise was, and uhh, I shot the living crap out of him for trespassing.
<DaringDerpy> so you finally stfu, DoYouWantToGetHigh? thanks
<CrystalPhoenix> DaringDerpy, well I thought people would read the newsletter
<cowvarkian> Serenity: why would you shoot someone for trespassing
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> still here, just not wasting my time on an obvious troll
<ouo> then you could, states will not worth
<Serenity> cowvarkian: Because I can
<cowvarkian> DoYouWantToGetHigh: aren't you an obvious troll?
<DaringDerpy> CrystalPhoenix: I never read it
<DoYouWantToGetHigh> i dunno, aren't you?

<cowvarkian> Serenity: eating the cake
*AssertiveFluttershy1 we
<ouo> what in my pockets?
<Serenity> You're a third correct
<cowvarkian> Serenity: well, you would jump in lava
<cowvarkian> What walks all day on its head?
<cachi01> A basket contains 5 apples. Do you know how to divide them among 5 kids so that each one has an apple and one apple stays in the basket?
<Serenity> Here's what I would do
<cowvarkian> cachi01: kill a kid
<ouo> i think ill grow some wings and fly away
<Kammerjunk> cachi01: Shove one kid down the basket.
<cachi01> cowvarkian: xD
<Kammerjunk> That'll teach the bugger.
<cachi01> Kammerjunk: eeyup
<Kammerjunk> Wait, what?
<cowvarkian> What gets wet when drying?
<Serenity> I would eat the cake, and since Atroquinnine poison takes around 20-30 minutes to kill, I would go to the hospital after being let go and cured
<cachi01> well actually it was give one kid the basket with an apple >.>

<cowvarkian> that'd be a much more interesting answer
<AssertiveFluttershy1> Think of words ending in -GRY. Angry and hungry are two of them. There are only three words inThe English language. What is the third word? The word is something that everyone uses every day. If you have listened carefully, I have already told you what it is.
<cachi01> dungry
<cachi01> lungry
<cachi01> fungry
<cachi01> qungry
<Kammerjunk> DaringDerpy: It looks like that guy's leg is over the woman's chest, and it's messing with my mind.
<cachi01> A girl who was just learning to drive went down a one-way street in the wrong direction, but didn't break the law. How come?
<Serenity> Angry
