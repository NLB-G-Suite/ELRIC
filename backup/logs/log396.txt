<Meanwhile> Shizuka don't troll the newbies.
<[SWAG]MattSmith> bronystate points make the world go round
<Paradise92> Quote from a fan in response "My son loved the original clip, he played it over and over, and when it first aired, he said that Derpy "is clumsy and talks funny like me but they still let her try!" The original clip made a child who is﻿ bullied and made fun of in school very very happy. The edit made him cry because "guess she's just not good enough." He also wanted to know why Rainbow Dash now talks to her like she's stupid
<StinkomanFan> I had Nachos last night!
<Shizuka> 13you need bronystate gold membership to learn whether it's a joke or not
<Meanwhile> Theyr'e too delicate

<Firefly> My internet doesn't always derp, but when it does, it does it at the most random of time.
<CCCP> Pinkieruler124: yes u
<flutter_spin> I just can't see Fluttershy that bold.
<CrossChop114> Parasprites, no!
<flutter_spin> Applejack, maybe
<GabeMoist> Hopefully that works out

<otakon> NewDCD: um, how do they expect you to survive without a FRIGGIN JOB?
<flutter_spin> Yeah that 3rd pic sort of scares me on EQD
<Firefly> WHAT
<otakon> NewDCD: how old are you again?
<Firefly> I DON'T WANT MOLESTIA
<Firefly> or to be stood on

<otakon> Meanwhile: you would say that...
<Snuffsis> Wow, not being allowed a part-time job is harsh. :(

<Firefly> HNNNG
<Firefly> SAVE ME
<mario_pony> your just not the girl for mee~
<otakon> NewDCD: seriously, no. How does that even work? You need a job to afford housing and food and amenities, how do they expect you to live?
<Snuffsis> otakon: loans obviously!
<NewDCD> 09,01they expect me to live how I have till now
<StinkomanFan> Maybe Surprise will be up for some nice, tender loving

<Firefly> WAT
<NewDCD> 09,01no but seriously the culture over here is different
<mario_pony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZLfasMPOU4&ob=av3e
<otakon> NewDCD: and your how old? I'm not judging, I'm just wondering is all.
<Meanwhile> At least you're in training DCD. I'm in the same boat, minus that crucial part.
<NewDCD> 09,01kids don't move out when they go to college, at least not usually
<NewDCD> 09,0120
<otakon> NewDCD: bc I too live with my mother and am out of work.
<Firefly> I DON'T NEED NO SURPRISE LOVING
<Ziltoidian> HAI GURLZ
<NewDCD> 09,01but yeah, over here
<NewDCD> 09,01the "dorm system" doesn't exist
<Meanwhile> Allo Ziltoidian.
<RaveBrony> Better late then never for celebrating I suppose :D http://theagileraver.deviantart.com/#/d4rik89
<Randomnerd|Exercise> otakon NewDCD Oh wow! I live at home too :(
<StinkomanFan> Well Firefly, I wanted me to have the Surprise loving because you turned me down :c
<NewDCD> 09,01the universities/colleges are just institutions you visit, kind of like high school, and have no housing installations
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Same ~
<GabeMoist> I forgot...Where are you DCD?
<flutter_spin> Its ok. The dorm system is odd here sometimes too. I know colleges that require you to live in the dorm
<NewDCD> 09,01Panama
<Dken2021> I liked living in the dorms
<RaveBrony> They dont look like the ones from the show, but theyre still muffins :P
<GabeMoist> ah
<Randomnerd> Me too.
<otakon> NewDCD: yh, here you would have been expected to move out, get a full time job, take out a loan on a house and have a fiancee waiting to tie the knot right out of college.
<Randomnerd> I miss it a lot, to be honest.
<Snuffsis> What i find weird is that they can decide that you aren't allowed to work part-time on your free time. :P
<NewDCD> 09,01so yeah, over here, you don't move out till muuuuuch later
<Dken2021> so much freedom you can do
<CCCP> RaveBrony: YAY! HAPPY DERPY DAY!
<RaveBrony> :$
<Dken2021> i miss the dorms too
<Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon> This is the song written for the train chase, this is the song, Rocky and Ken, HE TRIED TO KILL ME WITH A FORKLIFT!
<NewDCD> 09,01or well
<CrossChop114> Muffins or Cupcakes? Which is more delicious.
<flutter_spin> But I know a ton of parents who just kick their kid out at 18
<Ziltoidian> celebrated derpy day by eating 3 muffins
<CCCP> Muffins
<RaveBrony> Depends
<NewDCD> 09,01that's how it works with most other faculties
<klaxa> Muffins
<NewDCD> 09,01but in my med school, it's kind of like
<Mr> hello
<Firefly> you people scare me
<Meanwhile> Muffins, cupcakes. Both kinda make me think "Eh"
<CCCP> muffins turn me on
<valoreins> never ate cupcakes, so can't decide
<Firefly> I'M NOT A TABLE
<RaveBrony> Red velvet cupcakes > all
<Randomnerd> I'm pretty much out of it. I broke up with my girlfriend of five years. So much for marriage.
<flutter_spin> I like cupcakes
<NewDCD> 09,01"We forbid it because bitch, if you worked, you would have a 0% chance to pass this shit, cause this shit is INTENSE"
<CrossChop114> I love cupcakes. So sweet and tasty.
<Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon> Firefly well, this is the internet
<mario_pony> you know i'm not the little boy that i used to be i'm all grown up and baby can't you see~

<Saigneur> well i stole your face :)
<Dken2021> oh, great scott! and doc brown just got shot! I don't know how, but they found him at the malllllll!
<Randomnerd> Too little that I recognize.
<LadyCanary> Randomnerd: Why is that? Though I may have a feeling why
<Cypresswolf> One of the movies that I managed to catch was Transformers or something of that nature, filmed in Japan
<Cypresswolf> Its older than the US movies
<Eulshy> Beef stroganof is delicious
<Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon> Eulshy eliminates all of Eulshy's eating utensils necessary to eat the pasta
<Dken2021> kids react to asdf?
<Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon> */me
<Cypresswolf> I wish I knew what the title was
<Randomnerd> LadyCanary: Not enough Anime I recognize. Aside from DBZ and Sailor Moon.
<Saigneur> 2:35AM, my alarm goes off at 6AM ... ffffffuuuuu
<Dken2021> also noticed that video is filled with quotes
<Saigneur> SEE YOU EVERYPONY

*Eulshy eats pasta with a dagger
<Randomnerd> But I do like "Gosick".
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon eliminates Eulshy's dagger
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon nomz LadyCanary
<Randomnerd> It's pretty funny, and isn't freaking fanservicey.
*LadyCanary ish nommed
<flutter_spin> I'm not a big convention type of guy. My brother works at Comic-con and I've been there 3 times.
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon nomz LordCelestia
<Randomnerd> flutter_spin: Nice! Conventions can be a bit much.
<Dken2021> I want to go to a con someday
*Eulshy eats with a sword, quite awkwardly
<Randomnerd> Dken2021: Go to BRONYCON
<Cypresswolf> never made it a comic con, Mainly one that are held in Texas.
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon eliminates Eulshy's sword
<Firefly> Puhhhh, you are eating with a sword?
<Dken2021> but Ihave no way to go to bronycon :(
<otakon> okay, NOW my mom is here
<Randomnerd> I'm planning on three conventions this year.
<Firefly> You people are weird.
*Eulshy uses another sword
<otakon> so I am off to go eat, see y'all later
*Firefly snatches Eulshy's other sword.
<Randomnerd> bye, otakon
<Dken2021> Bronystate: where everyone's a silly filly, even the males
<flutter_spin> I'm also not the person who would go to a concert either. Never have been to one.
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon eliminates all of the swords accessible to Eulshy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Later otakon ~
*Eulshy uses hand axe
<Eulshy> i have a lot of these things

<Dken2021> that should be the site's slogan

<Ingwaz> she looks good
*Eulshy uses cup
<Cypresswolf> If anypony lives in or around Texas, houston's next anime convention is Anime Matsuri in April
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon eliminates all hand cups accessible to Eulshy
<Dken2021> she has nice big "packages"
*Eulshy uses hoofs
<flutter_spin> I still think her bubbles are too big
<Ingwaz> agreed Dken2021, they are a bit big...
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon chops off Eulshy's front hooves
<flutter_spin> But that specific artist draws them big
*Eulshy uses wings
<Eulshy> mmmm blood sauce
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon chops off Eulshy's wings
<flutter_spin> Besides that, she looks awesome.
<Randomnerd> Better big than exposed.
*Eulshy uses back hoofs
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon chops off Eulshy's back hooves
*valoreins weird boner
<Randomnerd> This fandom...
<Eulshy> this is starting to be a bad fan fic
*Eulshy uses face
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon duct tapes Eulshy's mouth shut
<flutter_spin> Did do a good job on: http://jadenkaiba.deviantart.com/art/Commission-MLP-Gala-Dresses-Human-Versions-282852480
<Randomnerd> It's super-effective!
<Eulshy> wrong choice
*Eulshy licks tape till un adhesive
<Snuffsis> flutter_spin: Omg that is amazing. :O
<Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon> You can't eat pasta if you can't open your mouth
<Ingwaz> ive seen that pic before flutter_spin, guess you're right, they do just do them kind of big
<Dken2021> twilight "tomes" are kinda big for her body
<Cypresswolf> I need to pay more attention to the guests attending conventions I attend. The VA who voiced GIR of Invader Zim was at Oni Con last October. I passed her table in the dealer's room several times and didnt realize it until after I saw her in the VA panel
*Eulshy pushes off with tounge
<Snuffsis> What is too big in that pic?
<Randomnerd> Rikki?
<flutter_spin> The entire artist panel can be a bit um, out there.
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon cuts out Eulshy's tongue then re-duct tapes mouth
<flutter_spin> But the 3 human mlp versions are the best I've seen
<SilverStreak> rawr
<SilverStreak> :P
<Dken2021> but it's a pretty picture regardless
<Randomnerd> Cypresswolf: I thought Rikki was a man and they just completely warped his voice.
<Dken2021> rawr to you SilverStreak
*Eulshy bleeds on tape untill un adhesive

<Cypresswolf> The Usual VA guests I see are from the local ADV branch in Houston. Carrie Savage, Vic Minogna, Chris Ayers
<flutter_spin> http://jadenkaiba.deviantart.com/gallery/?offset=24#/d4p57nn on the 3rd one if you wanted to know
*Eulshy chews it off
*LadyCanary dislikes Vic Minogna. And his crazy fanbase
*Eulshy continues to eat
<Dken2021> human ponies are best humans
<LadyCanary> I'm more of a Yuri Lowenthal girl.
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon pulls out Eulshy's teeth then re-duct tapes mouth
<Cypresswolf> I havent seen Vin Minogna in a couple years now actually
<MASF123> 6_9 HAPPY DERPY DAY!!!
<Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon> LadyCanary Vic who?
<LadyCanary> Exactly
<Randomnerd> Minogna was Yu-Gi-Oh, right?
*Eulshy wonders why people are letting him be brutally disfigured while trying to eat pasta
<LadyCanary> Yes
<flutter_spin> Well, humans OR ponies. http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/202/d/4/friendship_is_magic_by_extvia-d416u0m.jpg cross-work can be odd-looking
<Randomnerd> Oh, and Ed! I know FMA well enough :)
<Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon> Eulshy because this is the internet
<MASF123> SilverStreak your back
<Dken2021> oh my, aanthro ponie :|
<Ingwaz> that one is really well done as well flutter_spin
<Vinyl> I like it
*MASF123 leaves
<Ingwaz> i'm trying to find another humanized at the gala one i saw previously, their "package" size wasnt as big so i preferred it
<MASF123> :(
<Vinyl> toot a loo MASF123
*Eulshy pushes tape in mouth on the bowl, eats tape, continues to eat
<Cypresswolf> Im not sure if Vic was Yu-gi-oh, I do know he voiced Edward Elric in original dubbed FMA
<flutter_spin> Yeah. I loved their outfits, but its a little awkward on the faces
<LadyCanary> That's actually pretty cute, flutter_spin
*Firefly throws Eulshy in a pond, snickering.
<flutter_spin> Twi in that outfit is awesome
<LadyCanary> I like Rarity's
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon eliminates all the pasta accessible to Eulshy
*Eulshy has endless pasta, uses magic to heal self, swims out continues to eat
<Randomnerd> The dresses were very well adapted
<Cypresswolf> I'd like to see Paranoi Agent again. Ever since Geneon went bankrupt, that series has disapeared
*Firefly kicks....cow dirt, if you know what I mean, on Eulshy, bursting out laughing.
<Snuffsis> ingwaz: http://klinanime.deviantart.com/art/MLP-College-AU-Gala-Dresses-245163851 was it that one? :P
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon the pasta is still eliminated and out of Eulshy's reach though
<Ingwaz> http://dash.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/132956586179.jpg
<Ingwaz> no, not that one

<Randomnerd> Okay, Cypresswolf, do you know Record of Lodoss War?
<Cypresswolf> no
<flutter_spin> I liked Sailor Mercury. You probably see a pattern seeing I like Fluttershy too
<Dken2021> I remember how yu yu hakusho was screwed over by Cartoon network
<Randomnerd> Dang.
<Eulshy> mmm my pasta is finally mine to enjoy in peace yay
<Snuffsis> I watched dubbed Sailor Moon every morning before i went to Elementary School. xD
<LadyCanary> flutter_spin: Indeed!
*Ish[InsrtPronoun]Pon teleports pasta away from Eulshy and uses anti-magic spell on Eulshy to eliminate his powers

<EspyLacopa> So, who wants Haaaaam?
*Eulshy spell sheilds my magic necklace
*Capn_fisty gives Eulshy anti-pasta

<Capn_fisty> (pasta that moves backwards in time)
<Cypresswolf> I've heard of a Funimation Channel, but dont know what became of it. I havent seen it in any channel line up from Dish, Comcast, or whatever other competitor satelite companies offer
<flutter_spin> Well, 5minutes of it before i realized what "The Room" was about
<Randomnerd> Was it the Spess Mehreens?
<Midnight_Tempest> no one Randomnerd, i tend to burst into flames on my own... usually on a whim
<Randomnerd> Ah, okay.

<kenne> Eulshy: god why did they make popo blue
<Randomnerd> Hm...
<Tovler> Those anthro ponies look kinda cute; probably because the originals don't quite look like ponies.
<Randomnerd> Sounds a bit forced, flutter_spin I could understand that
<Eulshy> guys who wants to play the quiet game, which also means no typing
<Gunthler> Fluttershy is the world champ, you know
<LadyCanary> Whut.

<Snuffsis> I'm going to see it normally
<Snuffsis> I'm not into the 3d hype
<Cypresswolf> I just hope I live to see it in the theatres :)
<mario_pony> 3d blows
<Randomnerd> But I'm their huckleberry, so I'll watch it.
<piyo> did i win the quiet contest?
<flutter_spin> I saw how they were filming it all in the 3d cameras, but I just can't muster up seeing 3d
<Snuffsis> Call me when they've launched Virtual Reality instead. :P

*Midnight_Tempest sits back and watches the world burn.
<piyo> is the quiet contest over?
<flutter_spin> I like the trailer better. That clip is awesome though otakon
<Snuffsis> I want to see this the most
<Snuffsis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn1I4Stb-o8

<Cypresswolf> ^_^ The barrel escape in the Hobbit! That looks fun
<Ingwaz> >.< i want to play mass effect 3 so very bad
<Randomnerd> I cannot wait for Bioshock INFINITE
<Eulshy> the Hobbit was a good book
<Inquisitor> my roomate was telling me about Hunger Games and first thing that came to mind was Battle Royal
<mario_pony> let's forget super mario bros the movie
*mario_pony shivers
<FlutterEul> i liked the Hobbit
<flutter_spin> lol
<kenne> doesnt me3 release on the 5th?
<Randomnerd> Running Man/ The Long Walk.
<Ingwaz> releases on the 6th actually
<Ingwaz> most places will be doing a midnight release on the 5th though
<Randomnerd> Stephen King would like his royalties, kthxbai
<kenne> close enough
<Ingwaz> indeed
<flutter_spin> 6th
<Snuffsis> stephen king?
<Snuffsis> for what?
<Ingwaz> and you can bet i will be up all night probably playing htat since its spring break
<FlutterEul> im bored
<mario_pony> stephen king now theres a good writer
<Eulshy> me too
<jffry890> i found this and maybe it can fuel you derpy situation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmOxnt215ek&feature=related
<Yahooz> yeah same :p
<flutter_spin> Wait wait wait... Disney XD is getting ... PacMan tv show?
<Cypresswolf> Im gonna go. I feel like sneaking out to a movie now :)
<Snuffsis> Meh, i'm already tired of watching movie trailers.
<Snuffsis> this is more fun
<Snuffsis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFzdIaBnckg
<Eulshy> :)
<FlutterEul> :$
<Randomnerd> Snuffsis: King wrote novellas about kids killing eachother in a dictatorship before Battle Royale
<mario_pony> Cypresswolf: go watch Project X
<Cypresswolf> I think......the Navy Seals movie
<Snuffsis> Yea, i know Stephen King... xD
<Snuffsis> If i were a deep one
<Randomnerd> Well, to be fair, the Kids don't kill each other in the Long Walk.
<flutter_spin> When that girl goes into Derpy-voice, I freaked
<Snuffsis> blublublublublub
<mario_pony> cthulhu?

<FlutterEul> :P
<Randomnerd> Dat Alter Kocker Cthulu
<Snuffsis> awesome song.
<Cypresswolf> Project X doesnt show until 12:01 am O_o
<flutter_spin> But it is awkward hearing her speech in that voice. I prefer only hearing the derpy-voice ... with derpy personality
<mario_pony> hey there cthulhu hows it in you sunken city?
<Snuffsis> hehe
<Gunthler> 106 push-ups, 3 sets of 35
<FlutterEul> :S
<Eulshy> :|
<flutter_spin> ;)
<Gunthler> is that bueno?
<jffry890> she makes very good points though
<Snuffsis> People in general are just afraid of offending people
<jffry890> although i was thinking her same solution before i even saw the video:
<kenne> thats 105 hombre
<flutter_spin> Yeah. I just wish she wasn't so sarcastic
<Gunthler> i did one extra
<flutter_spin> Reminds me of my step-sister. She was beyond annoying.
<Cypresswolf> Act of Valor 9:10 :) Im gonna get ready, later
<jffry890> change her voice, change her name, fine. change her eyes, god dammit hasbro
<kenne> its more than i ever did in one sitting

<FlutterEul> Hewwo
<Eulshy> Krackass
<otakon> http://postimage.org/image/sg8g8ktkv/
<RAWRity> meh, i fell out of interest with Neurotically Yours very quickly
*Midnight_Tempest is now installing MechWarrior 3. Awww yeeeaahhh.
<otakon> THIS is my reaction to all things odd now.
<mario_pony> no one corrupts the way you do you know it's true~
<jffry890> why
<flutter_spin> THATS YOU?
<jffry890> rawrity why
<flutter_spin> MAN! It is like looking into a mirror!
<mario_pony> the necromonicon~
<flutter_spin> Same glasses and everything
<FlutterEul> Midnight_Tempest i beat
<Capn_fisty> necronomeconomics
<Eulshy> Mechwarrior 3
<flutter_spin> *touches screen*
<Vinyl> So tired... to bed I go
<Inquisitor> I haven't watched a neurotically yours in a long time... I didn't think all the flashes were funny, some of em were
<Saturn> 08,01OTAKON IS NOT AMUSED: http://s19.postimage.org/ivotlp48y/PICT0006.jpg
<mario_pony> Capn_fisty: thats quite a mouthfull
<Vinyl> Da hell did you get that picture Saturn?
<Capn_fisty> ping scared she shite out of me
<LadyCanary> Saturn!
<Vinyl> Okay, whatever goodnight everybody
<mario_pony> lol
<Snuffsis> Suddenly: Saturn
<Snuffsis> :O
<flutter_spin> Except I have earphones.
<LadyCanary> Goodnight Vinyl <3
<mario_pony> g'night Vinyl
<jffry890> Pilze squirrel songs - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTYw91WWRME
<Saturn> 08,01Vinyl: he doesn't know, but i've got access to his webcam remotely
<RAWRity> jffry890: just didn;t find it very interesting. There's only so many times I could hear him rant about how stupid everybody else is, while perpetuating the same stereotypes he put on blast.
<Saturn> 08,01LadyCanary! *hugs*
<Vinyl> O U Saturn
<Vinyl> ^-^
<FlutterEul> Creepy picture
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> you have some big ass eyebrows!!!
<Eulshy> is creepy
*LadyCanary hugs Saturn back :3
<RAWRity> actually, the real story is that Saturn and otakon are secretly the same person.
<mario_pony> do any of you know the books the golden compass?
<Flaria> mario_pony: His Dark Materials?
<LadyCanary> Flaria!!!!
<RAWRity> mario_pony: you mean His Dark Materieals trilogy?
<RAWRity> yeah.
<Flaria> 'ey.
<otakon> RAWRity: enope, he's a six foot scot with pink hair
*Flaria hugs LadyCanary
<LadyCanary> Oh my gahh Flaria :3 :3
*RAWRity huggles Flaria
<LadyCanary> How I've missed your hugs, Flaria
<Inquisitor> Saturn 2 boxes bronystate, his other box... otakon
<mario_pony> my teacher told me what he did
*Flaria huggles RAWRity~
<RAWRity> otakon: I never said you weren't a master of disguise.
<FlutterEul> we talk
<Eulshy> funnily don't we
<kenne> hey guys my internets crapping out =( so im gunna go
<Flaria> I'm sorry, Lady... been busy :<
<Flaria> Bai kenne!
<otakon> I am NOT Saturn
*Flaria hugs
<RAWRity> see ya kenne
<mario_pony> that he wen't on t.v and said how much god doesn't exist
<otakon> see ya kenne
<LadyCanary> Flaria: Dont apologize! D: I completely understand!
<RoseyPony> heh......http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgnIjJexut4
<LadyCanary> <3
<LadyCanary> Ah that RoseyPony. VERY amusing.
<Inquisitor> you may not be Saturn otakon... but Saturn is you.... Mind - Blown
<RAWRity> mario_pony: well, seeing as that entire Trilogy was about KILLING GOD, I'm not surprised.
<RoseyPony> :)
<mario_pony> seriously!!:O
<otakon> Inquisitor: no, because I'm not a SIX FOOT SCOTSMAN!
<RAWRity> mario_pony: yeah. A pair of teenagers literally kill God in the last book.
<mario_pony> wow that makes my heart feel weird...
<RAWRity> and it's all about how the Church equates Free Will with Sin, and want all living people to be unthinking and unfeeling.
<Krakass> god creates dinosaurs. god destroys dinosaurs. god creates man. man destroys god. man creates dinosaurs
<FlutterEul> i feel as though
<Krakass> dinosaurs kill man, woman inherits the earth
<Eulshy> this is weird way of talking
<RAWRity> the author essentially said he wanted to create "an atheist answer to the Chronicles of Narnia"
<Inquisitor> jurassic park...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> what's going on here ~
<Krakass> We have a winner!
<RAWRity> Pullman! that's his name!
<RAWRity> couldn't remember it for a moment.
<mario_pony> the golden compass writer was evil....
<Inquisitor> never saw golden compass
<RAWRity> mario_pony: not evil. Just very, very pushy in his disrepspect for organized christianity.
<Krakass> What makes him evil? Does he flick off kittens and punch babies?
<mario_pony> Krakass: maybe
<RAWRity> Inquisitor: don't. That movie sucks balls.
<Inquisitor> who HASN'T punched a baby though? I mean... BOOOO
<FlutterEul> id punch a baby
<Eulshy> but never flick a kitten
<mario_pony> but why would he do that say bad things about other people religions
<Krakass> In my defense, the baby was kinda being a dick.
<RAWRity> mario_pony: because he's kind of an asshole. But asshole =/= evil.
<LadyCanary> ...That's kinda mean spirited :/
<LadyCanary> Dont hurt the babies :P
<CK|Asleep> :(
<FlutterEul> TURN ALL THE BABIES
<Eulshy> INTO KITTENS
<mario_pony> Krakass and FlutterEul: i would punch you two!
<jffry890> i know a squirrel who gave babies magical candies of dreams!
<RAWRity> and really, while I have serious disagreements with Pullman's feelings on religion and faith, the stories he wrote, and the way he wrote them, were damn good.
<Krakass> http://yudhaikeledai.deviantart.com/art/MLP-Thinking-with-Portals-Rainbow-Highway-287105543
<Inquisitor> whoo... I got off scott free from mario_pony's vengeance!
<FlutterEul> L
<Eulshy> o
<FlutterEul> L
<mario_pony> Ingwaz: i would throw you in a pit
<Flaria> RAWRity: Yeah, the worlds he describes are beautiful
<Krakass> Poor Ingwaz.
<Ingwaz> that crap for?
<mario_pony> Inquisitor: i would throw you in a fire
<RAWRity> mario_pony: but Ingwaz didn't do anything!
<Flaria> aaaaa I don't want to go find those books and read 'em again
<mario_pony> Ingwaz: sowy tab fail
<Krakass> mario_pony is just a very violent pony.
<RAWRity> I have the entire trilogy on my bookshelf right now.
<Krakass> He jumps on turtles' heads for no reason.
<mario_pony> no i'm not!!!!
<FlutterEul> :)<3;)
<mario_pony> Krakass: sooooo? i don't see your point
<Eulshy> ^ better love story than twilight
<Inquisitor> in mario's defense the turtles do ask for it...
<mario_pony> ^
<RAWRity> mario_pony x Krakass is best Love story
*Firefly makes a disgusted face.
<mario_pony> they look at me funny
<Firefly> You guys are mushy.
<mario_pony> Krakass? eeeeewwwwww
<FlutterEul> im having so
<Eulshy> much fun doing
<FlutterEul> this
<mario_pony> um....
<mario_pony> Krakass: lol jk
<Inquisitor> last book I read was Warhammer 40,000: Hammer and Anvil and now I'm pickin up Hitchhiker's Guide
<Krakass> Of course you were, cause I'm dead smexy.
<Snuffsis> Anyone here that knows math? Need a bit of help. :P
<mario_pony> smexy?
<mario_pony> Snuffsis: me!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Krakass> It's like sexy, but better.
<Capn_fisty> i tab back in to Krakass being sexy?
<Snuffsis> Okay, i'll PM you then. :P
<RAWRity> I have a book you all should pick up: http://www.amazon.com/This-Book-Full-Spiders-Seriously/dp/0312546343
<Krakass> Sounds like a book for Saturn
<Yahooz> SPIDERS!
<mario_pony> Snuffsis: what grade are you in?
<Yahooz> PUNCH EM!
<Inquisitor> I wen't to art school, I can't help you with anything remotely academic
<RAWRity> it's a sequel to "John Dies At The End"
<Snuffsis> I'm studying at university. :P
<Inquisitor> went to even
<LadyCanary> It is RAWRity? Well dang
<FlutterEul> Fear me i
<Eulshy> have many voices
<Krakass> Pythagorean theorem is the answer Snuffsis
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: eeyup. Due out in October.
<Snuffsis> Krakass: Thats just..., no, wrong... :P
<RAWRity> "John Dies At The End" followed by "This Book Is Full of Spiders: Seriously, Dude, Don't Touch It"
<Krakass> Well then you're asking the wrong question.
<Yahooz> Well thats a very attractive title :p
<RaveBrony> Oh, wth! What causes the chat to derp? My computer must hate me, lol
<FlutterEul> I am a pegasus and
<Eulshy> i have no idea what i'm doing
<Snuffsis> I'm not actually asking for the length of the hypotenuse
<Snuffsis> so....
<Inquisitor> I cause the chat to derp
<Yahooz> What are you asking for?
<Snuffsis> i got the number (5^x+5^-x)^2 and i'm supposed to simplify it. :P
<Yahooz> OH XD
<Yahooz> hold on one sec
<Randomnerd> 1
<mario_pony> 42
<FlutterEul> I derped my eyes today on purpose
<Eulshy> ran into stuff about 5 times
<Snuffsis> I got it as 5^2x+5^-2x but answer sheet says it's 5^2x + 2 + 5^-2x
<Inquisitor> wouldn't that be 0^2?
<Randomnerd> sorry, I'm dumb, that's not right, urgh. Hang on, lemme get some paper.
<BronyHunter> Math?
<Thunder> 6_9
<Yahooz> Snuffsis: Remember, dont just distribute the exponent to the other exponents
<pony_5743> ???
<FlutterEul> the answer to life, the universe and everything is 42
<Eulshy> the number twilight has in that episode
<Snuffsis> Yahooz, hmm?
<Inquisitor> wait I'm confused here, is the variable the exponent?
<mario_pony> um....
*mario_pony is confused with all this math talk
<RAWRity> Snuffsis: it's because you've got to set it as (5^x + 5^-x)(5^x + 5^-x
<Yahooz> (5^x + 5^-x)^2 = (5^x + 5^-x) * (5^x + 5^-x)
<Thunder> the fuck is this?
<Yahooz> So theres a third term
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> math
<Capn_fisty> Maths
<mario_pony> math
<Saturn> 08,01http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwRMYz1vfcQ
<Yahooz> which should be 3
<Yahooz> *2
<Eulshy> math
<NullRadix> This is mathematics, the language of science!
<Yahooz> lolmybad XD
<Eulshy> this is 0
<Snuffsis> Hmm...
<BronyHunter> Math its so hard
<RAWRity> then you just FOIL it.
<Krakass> FOIL?
<NullRadix> Or...you know... nonsense... we can do nonsense with Math too
<PinkieSpice> ...
<Snuffsis> I really don't see where the +2 comes from, but oh well. xD
<Shizuka> 13NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS
<Yahooz> FOIL
<Krakass> First Inner Outer LAST
<Yahooz> lol Shizuka XD
<PinkieSpice> minotaurs in equestria
<FlutterEul> Hey math guys
*mario_pony is nerd
<Eulshy> I divided by zero
*NullRadix puts on his best evil voice: "Argh! FOIL'd again!"
<Krakass> Damnit
<Snuffsis> Shizuka: <3
<PinkieSpice> and they are intelligent
<FlutterEul> now what
<PinkieSpice> ...
<Krakass> I could never do foil in the right order.
<RAWRity> Snuffsis: take (5^x + 5^-x) * (5^x + 5^-x) and FOIL it.
<Yahooz> 0/0 is NOT Undefined. Its indefinet form
<Eulshy> does the world explode
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> math is not hard it's just awfully repetitive ~
<LadyCanary> Shizuka!!! :D :D
<FlutterEul> or just the number
<Yahooz> Math is soooooooooooooo EASY
<Shizuka> 13canary~<3
<BronyHunter> true true
*PinkieSpice now forced to choose between being a dragon or a minotaur
*LadyCanary hugs Shizuka. How is you sweetie
<PinkieSpice> ;A;
<RAWRity> Math is useful. Learning Math is tedious as all hell.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^
<Shizuka> 13so busy ><
<Shizuka> 13big things coming~
<NullRadix> Dragons are bigger. Get Imp Knockdown and spam it like you mean it
<FlutterEul> Yahooz divide by zero then
*Flaria hugs Shizuka
<Eulshy> yes Yahooz divide by zero
<PinkieSpice> but math is pure and simple logic??
<Snuffsis> RAWRity: Foil meaning? It's a bit hard since i'm studying in Swedish, anot English. So i on'y know the Swdish terms. :P
<Flaria> Breadmeister~
<Shizuka> 13flaria~
<LadyCanary> :3 How exciting!
<Krakass> No, don't do in Yahooz, you'll kill us all.
<Yahooz> 0/0 :3
<Krakass> it*
<PinkieSpice> whats wrong with pure and simple logic?
<Yahooz> ITS INDEFINET FORM
<Yahooz> it doesnt count :3
<NullRadix> Logic requires rational thought! We cant' have that!
<Krakass> Snuffsis, First Outer Inner Last
<Inquisitor> 1/0.... oh shi-
<NullRadix> I mean... if everyone started using Logic...
<Yahooz> Inquisitor: NOOOOOOOO
<FlutterEul> what if something divided by zero
<Eulshy> will lead us to Equestria?
<NullRadix> the world would explode
<Yahooz> /Valno
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope
*PinkieSpice uses logic
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> pinkie logic ?
*mario_pony is freaking the buck out
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> right
<mario_pony> i lost my homework!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Krakass> Dog eat it?
<mario_pony> OMG what am i gonna do!?
<PinkieSpice> and pinkie pie uses logic, its how she breaks the fourth wall. :U
<jffry890> so movie night is tomorrow and the front page is still not updated
<FlutterEul> Troll logic +
<Eulshy> Pinkie logic =
<jffry890> whats movies/ponies are being played tomorrow
<FlutterEul> a black hole
*mario_pony is breathing hard
<PinkieSpice> using logic in a nological place breaks the diemsional walls
<mario_pony> oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god
<PinkieSpice> allowing for more sillyness
<PinkieSpice> and party fun
<jffry890> whats movies/ponies are being played tomorrow
<FlutterEul> oh you guys are soo boring
<Eulshy> don't even care im using two names
<RAWRity> Snuffsis: take the first number in each set of brackets, and multiply them. This time it would be 5^x * 5^x. Then the first in the first set of parentheses, and the last in the second. So it's 5^x * 5^-x. Then the 2nd number in the first set times the first number of the second set. 5^-x * 5^x. Then the last number in each set. 5^.x * 5^-x.
<mario_pony> what am i gonna doooo!?!?!?!?!?
<Yahooz> FOIL
*PinkieSpice is a twilight sparkle
<mario_pony> i'm gonna fail science!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<PinkieSpice> and a futtershy
<mario_pony> then i'm gonna have to redo the 8th grade!!!!!!!!11
<Yahooz> hmmm
<PinkieSpice> with a good dash of rainbow dash
<Snuffsis> Yea, did that. But i didn't get 5^2x+2+5^-2x. the +2 they say it is, became a +10 for me... :P
<Inquisitor> ask a rhetorical question then answer it mario_pony
<Krakass> They're going to send you to science kindergarten.
<mario_pony> oh wait it's in my pocket
<LadyCanary> Dun dun dun.
<RAWRity> Then you add the together, like this: (5^x*5^x)+(5^x*5^-x)+(5^-x*5^x)+(5^-x+5^-x)
*mario_pony facehoofs
<PinkieSpice> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tOtPERJ8r8&feature=player_embedded#!
<FlutterEul> shoot me
*Eulshy shoots FlutterEul
<mario_pony> nooo thats my math homework!!!1
<Randomnerd> What.
<Snuffsis> AAH i see what i did wrong
<mario_pony> wheres my scince homework!!!!!!!!
<Yahooz> Snuffsis: While foiling the broblem
<Yahooz> ...
<Yahooz> yeah you got it :3
<RAWRity> so you get (5^2x)+(5^0)+(5^0)+(5^-2x)
<FlutterEul> lol ping myself
<Eulshy> FlutterEul
<Yahooz> nonononono
<FlutterEul> is fun
<RAWRity> Whis is 5^2x+1+1+5^-2x
<mario_pony> mario_pony:
<Yahooz> 5^x * 5^-x = 1
<Snuffsis> Yea, i didn't do 5^0, i just removed the exponent completely making it 5+5 instead of 5^0+5^0 :P
<Yahooz> 1 * 2
<Yahooz> =2
<RAWRity> which is 5^2x+2+5^-2x
<Yahooz> so the middle term is two
<mario_pony> mario_pony: your gonna fail school!!!!
<Snuffsis> Thanks for helping me figure out what i did wrong. <3
<Yahooz> yep :3
<mario_pony> mario_pony: i know
<Yahooz> No prob ^_^
<mario_pony> mario_pony: how could you looose it!?
<mario_pony> mario_pony: i don't know!!
<RAWRity> no problem. I had that shit drilled into my head when I was learning Algebra in high school.
<Yahooz> lol Im not even in college yet XD
<Eulshy> FlutterEul double ping
<RAWRity> I don't even use it anymore, but I remember it. Damn you Mr. Wood and you're 1 1/2 arms!
<FlutterEul> Eulshy
<mario_pony> oh god
<Krakass> was the other half of an arm a wood prothstetic?
<Yahooz> but seriously though,you MUST FOIL it right
<Snuffsis> Math is awesome, but it's not really my favorite subject, i'm just learnign all this shit so i can go ahead with Game Development. xD
<Yahooz> Game Development?
<Krakass> Games = Physics = Much matho
<Yahooz> Do Computer Science dude :p
<Krakass> And math as well.
<Yahooz> Math is helpful for that...
<Snuffsis> Yea, i'm going to (if plands hold out) study at the same university as the guys behind Magicka
*PinkieSpice splashes twilight sparkle with cursed water from spring of drowned hot blooded stallion. :U
<Yahooz> but Learning to program is 90 percent of it
<Snuffsis> doing Game Development
<RAWRity> Krakass: nope, just a strange nub that bent at the elbow
<Snuffsis> Krakass Physics is simpler math though. Atleast i think so.
<mario_pony> maybe it's in my mom's car i'll go check brb
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mu reaction at my first day of college for software engineer "Oh God Why"
<Eulshy> DON'T YOU USE UR FANCY MATHMATICS ON ME
<Snuffsis> I got it easier to wrap my head around physics than complex mathematics
<RAWRity> Physics isn't necessarily simpler, but much more practical.
<Yahooz> Physics :3333
<Krakass> Dat vector math
<Eulshy> i wonder if any of my rp sites updated?
<Yahooz> its so easy because everything is formulaic
<Snuffsis> Yea
<Snuffsis> It's not THAT many calculations to do either
<Yahooz> at least in a vacuum XD
<Yahooz> irl physics is serious biz
<Snuffsis> I mean, everything has a letter to it so you can just write a formula in physics like E=mc^2
<RaveBrony> And Flash player crashes yet again! Talk about Derpy day :\
<Snuffsis> (not really, but the point remains hte same:P)
<Yahooz> well, not everything, Snuffsis :p
<Snuffsis> Most of the stuff, gravity, newton, force, wavelength, amplitutde
<Yahooz> yeah that stuff is simple
<Snuffsis> all the important basic stuff has a letter to it
<Krakass> As long as you ignore air resistance and friction physics is easy.
<Yahooz> Now PARTICLE PHYSICS
<Yahooz> thats hard
<Krakass> Ignoring gravity simplifies things even further
<Snuffsis> Yea, i'm not going into particle physics field
<Snuffsis> i'm going into game development. xD
<Yahooz> Idk if i will
<Krakass> Well don't use particle emitters then.
<Snuffsis> At most i'll need to be able to do calculations in 3d space, if i want to develop my own graphics engine
<Yahooz> game development is a cool thing to get into, but let me warn you, learning to program for the first time may induce RAEG
<Snuffsis> Otherwise it's all linear algebra
<Krakass> There's plenty of middleware availble these days for games development.
<Krakass> Physics engines, lighting engines, etc.
<jffry890> i only passed algebre skill II
<Snuffsis> Yahooz: I already know a little bit of basic programming, dabbled in it during my first gear in "Gymnasium" where i made a text game. :P
<DuskStarshimmer> id there anything to whatch tonight?
<jffry890> no dusk
<Yahooz> bah gtg :p Wont be here for BMN... so ill see you guys during the new ep ^_^
<Snuffsis> Krakass: True, but this university i'm at is high quality, they will let you develop your own engine completely.
<Inquisitor> awww.... later Yahooz
<Snuffsis> It's the same university where the Magicka team graduated from.
<Krakass> Bye Yahooz
<DuskStarshimmer> Thanks jffry890
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night Yahooz See ya ~
<Snuffsis> Night yahooz
<Krakass> I had to look Magicka up, seems like neat game.
<mario_pony> buck it,s not in my moms car!:'(
<Snuffsis> Wow, didn't know about Magicka? xd
<Krakass> mario_pony, check your other pocket.

<Snuffsis> Inquisitor you mean Temple of doom is second best
<LadyCanary> He thinks there are 4 Indy movies.
<LadyCanary> I think there are 3.
<gold> i just ate a baked bad
<Snuffsis> Isn't there only 3 movies?
<Inquisitor> I hate dbz, but that image is awesome RAWRity
*Krakass thinks LadyCanary is right
<LadyCanary> :3
<gold> and it's not that bad
<RAWRity> ther'es 3 movies nd an abortion.
<LadyCanary> Tell Saxy that when he comes in.
<Krakass> Just like there were no Matrix sequels.

*SilverStreak loves the muffin TheGreatAndPowerfulT gave
<DeadpoolDash> star wars had 3 abortions

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope
<Snuffsis> Well, sorry Canary, but i just forgot about "The Last Crusade" :(
<Meeplord> ah
<Inquisitor> eh, I never liked temple of doom, everyone but jones was an anoying plot devise or aping chimp
<Krakass> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdZ1va0AQYc should just be left on the stream when there's nothing else.
<LadyCanary> Snuffsis: Wasnt as bad as the supposed 4th.
<Snuffsis> Well, best movie is still evil nazis using magic
<RaveBrony> Indeed Krakass

<LadyCanary> In the words of Saxy to me: If jesus then aliens.
<RaveBrony> o.o
<Krakass> All of the Indiana Jones moview had their flaws.
<Midnight_Tempest> survives a nuke in a lead cased fridge... I CALL BULLLLLLSHIT!
<SilverStreak> aeiou
<Inquisitor> I remember walking into the student union at my school and there was a guy in the corner crying, I asked what was up, and one of his friends came up and said "aliens in the new indiana jones movie" and I had to supress the lulz
<mario_pony> and sometimes w
<Snuffsis> There are too many members in the Bronystate steam group. T_T
<Krakass> Raiders had the long submarine ride that he held his breath for.

<Snuffsis> It's a shame that there aren'y lots of conventions in Sweden, and most people aren't really that good at making decent outfits.
<Phase4> ohai
<Inquisitor> I wanted to do a gender reversal cosplay with all my guy friends and 1 girlfriend, do the main 6 with guys and she dress as spike
<RoflBot> so... when do i get my newsletter =/
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Phase4 ~
<Snuffsis> Inquisitor that would be awesome. :D
<otakon> Inquisitor: crossplay with ponies? seems legit
<LadyCanary> That would be interesting!
<Inquisitor> I'd so get a perm and do pinkie
<Phase4> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<LadyCanary> For some reasons I'd REALLY love to do Photo Finish.
<RoflBot> it'd be awesome if some ppl dressed up as molestia and trollestia

<Snuffsis> That sucks.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It took up my weeks to write my thesis.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Weekdays.
<RoflBot> life sucks but if you suck it up and be calm you can get through anything
<Ingwaz> got to have it checked repeatedly and approved, and some professors disagree with others on certain parts...

<Midnight_Tempest> singularity sucks
<RAWRity> MahBoi777: so her name would be Peemy?
<flutter_spin> I played TF2. Was no good at it.
<Ingwaz> its not that challenging, but the gameplay is fun enough and the idea and story were interesting
<MahBoi777> I guess so, LOL
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that...sounds like a baaaad name
<Midnight_Tempest> play more TF2, get better... thats legit

<RAWRity> also, I would pay good money to have Tabitha St. Germaine read, in the original Derpy voice, "You magnificent son of a bitch, I read your book!"
<flutter_spin> I played a bit of KOTOR & Fallout 3 but lost interest after about 3 hours in
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat comic made me a half decent spy and medic ~
<Midnight_Tempest> i cant play KOTOR... tanis is just sooooo booorrinngg
<flutter_spin> Fallout 3 kept glitching on me badly.
<MahBoi777> I put so many hours into Fallout 3
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah... its like that, but its still an awesome game
<Midnight_Tempest> ive put more hours into F:NV than Fallout 3... just cause of the DLC
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oblivion is the same, a bit glitchy but awesome
<RAWRity> so, what' the largest amount of time you've put into a game?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14360+ hours
<LadyCanary> Hm....
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Pokemon Sapphire

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> over ~ 400 hours
<LadyCanary> DAMN Saxy.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I think it's close to 400?
<flutter_spin> World of Warcraft. Who knows how many hours

<SaxyPretender> 0,14RIVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL
<RAWRity> I know Mine's on Pokemon White. Lemme check real quick.
<Taylorhound> :P
<LadyCanary> I'd say mine was in Pokemon Leaf Green.
<Midnight_Tempest> 600+ hours... Mass Effect 2, PC and XBo 360 verisons combined total...
<Taylorhound> anyone else think there should be a derpy hooves room?
<RAWRity> 317 hours in Pokemon White. Not bad for only being out a year, eh?
<Ingwaz> christ Midnight_Tempest ...how many saves do you have?
<flutter_spin> Here recently? 220 hours in Skyrim
<BritishBrony> :[_________________________]
<Midnight_Tempest> Ingwaz: i dont know anymore... my XBox HD burned out... thats why i played the PC version :$
<BritishBrony> : [______________________________]
<MahBoi777> hi BritishBrony
<RAWRity> especially considering there's jack shit to do when you finish the main storyline
<flutter_spin> I thought about getting Rift a trial and perhaps Aion since it went f2p
<BritishBrony> Heythar.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14317? that's my birthday!
<BritishBrony> :P
<RAWRity> wait, let me check something...
<LadyCanary> Saxy is oooooooooooooold.
<MahBoi777> LOL
<RAWRity> aww, that would have been cool.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<BritishBrony> Lol, there were quads born on the day of a leap year. :3
<RAWRity> I was hoping Black/White released in the US on 3/17
<RAWRity> but nope. 3/10
<flutter_spin> Skyrim was THE game I got excited about. These other games are just on my backburner. Games that people say are awesome but I still have no interest
<BritishBrony> Dat stream.
<BritishBrony> DER IS NONE
<MahBoi777> I liek the black stream
<RAWRity> Hmm...wonder if I can get to 350 before the release date. 9 days left, and I'd need 33 hours...that'd be around 3.5 a day.
<Gunthler> G'night everypony, i'm falling asleep
<flutter_spin> Cous recommends Fallout 3 as my next game. Says a good 90 hours in it.
<Phase4> night GuntherDW
<Midnight_Tempest> Skyrim... ive heard it defined as Fallout with swords... but i also heard Fallout described as Oblivion with guns so... *shrugs*
<Phase4> i meen Gunthler
<MahBoi777> gnight Gunthler
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Gunthler
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> night Gunthler
<LadyCanary> And now I watch my fave episode of Brave and the Bold~
<flutter_spin> Well I played a good 5 hours into Oblivion but didn't care for the combat. But Skyrim I loved to death.
<Phase4> Midnight_Tempest: to be fair the development was oblivion->fallout->skyrim
<RAWRity> also, It's now my goal to break 500 hours in Pokemon White before White/Black 2 releases in the states.
<flutter_spin> I just love mountains and dragons *cough*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14is it the Birds of Prey one, LadyCanary
<Midnight_Tempest> they refined the combat for skyrim, thats why its so good
<MahBoi777> SANDVICH TIEM, brb
<BritishBrony> I'm going to breakfast. Laters!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, sounds like a CHALLENGE, RAWRity
<LadyCanary> SaxyPretender: Actually, it's the one with Huntress and Blue Beetle (<3)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later BritishBrony
<Midnight_Tempest> mfw bethesda makes a Fallout Canada... that would make me gasm...
<LadyCanary> Jaime Reyes Blue Beetle to be exact <3
<DeadpoolDash> Fallout 3/New Vegas taught them so much about what gamers like, that why Skyrim is what it is.
<MahBoi777> Robot mounties:D
<Midnight_Tempest> ^ yes
<flutter_spin> It is a little odd that I have tired out on doing nothing. Maybe I should go spend another 200 hours trying to find another job.
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: You know, it's a shame what they did with Jaime after the New 52 reboot.
<Midnight_Tempest> i approved of Robomounties
<LadyCanary> I didnt read it yet, RAWRity.
<LadyCanary> BUT I did read Animal Man's.
<DeadpoolDash> In the Fallout lore the USA annexed Canada
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: well, he now keeps the Scarab secret from his family and friends, and there's lots of brooding about how evil the scarab is, and how he has to fight it for control.
<flutter_spin> How was Deux Ex Human Revolution?
<LadyCanary> ....WHAT?!
<Lunarletic> I never asked for it
<LadyCanary> I loved how he didnt keep it a secret. His family was so awesome and accepting of it.
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: eeyup. They gave Jaime a gritty reboot.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<Midnight_Tempest> in all the Fallout games, its taken place in what is left of the States... i would like to see a Fallout in another country... or continent, that would be interesting
<SaxyPretender> 0,14stupid grim and gritty
<LadyCanary> And plus.....Jaime is a sweetie :3
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: I know! it was really nice to have him be open with his family about it, and actually have FUN being a superhero.
<LadyCanary> ^
<flutter_spin> lol. Fallout in the desert. I'm sorry, nothing changed.
<LadyCanary> I loved his relationship with Milagro, his sister.
<LadyCanary> So cute.
<Polydunami> Hello there everypony ^__^
<RAWRity> But no, instead we've gotta have a book where The scarab takes control of Jaime, and he bitch slaps Brenda into a car.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<LadyCanary> ....
*DeadpoolDash if it wasn't in North America you wouldn't have any of the connections to the other games and the factions involved
<LadyCanary> WHAT.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14who's writing it again?
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: that happens.
<MahBoi777> hi Polydunami!
<LadyCanary> But...
*Midnight_Tempest is confused as to what is being talked about now. -__-
<flutter_spin> For someone who has yet to play ANY Fallout games, I would probably just lose out on all the lore.
<Polydunami> Indeed
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: I know. It's awful.
<LadyCanary> TT_TT
<Midnight_Tempest> play fallout 1, its pretty awesome and very different to 3 and new vegas
<LadyCanary> Why Jaime....:(
<flutter_spin> Well I dont have it. I have Fallout 3
<Midnight_Tempest> use the pirate bay to get a torrent
<flutter_spin> Well, I don't really know how to and I don't want to.
<Placebo> Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free~
<Midnight_Tempest> -_-
<flutter_spin> I rather just have my cous lend me the games.
<Midnight_Tempest> thats Pony Placebo... not pirate...
<RAWRity> Oh god...New 52 Blue Beetle is written by Tony Bedard. He wrote for part of countdown...
<Dismo> Ayyooo!
<LadyCanary> Hi Dismo~
<Placebo> Midnight_Tempest: Hmm.. Pony_Pirates?
<Midnight_Tempest> a wild Dismo appears
<Polydunami> Hey Dismo ^__^
<flutter_spin> Pip the Pirate
*DeadpoolDash New 52 Deathstroke is pretty awesome
<Midnight_Tempest> Placebo... maybe... maybe... *rubs chin*
<Placebo> Sudden fiction idea?
<Placebo> lol.
<Midnight_Tempest> :D
<LadyCanary> Ah Slade Wilson <3
<Dismo> n_n <3 I love you guys. <3
<Midnight_Tempest> wub wub
<Placebo> Dat Dubstep wub.
<LadyCanary> I'd love to read some Titans comics so I can learn a bit more about his daughter Ravager.
<flutter_spin> I'll figure it out. I just got back from my cous telling me how his wedding went in the Phillipines
<Midnight_Tempest> untz untz wubwubwub
<Dismo> I don't see my husband. :I
<Phase4> http://school.failblog.org/2012/03/01/homework-class-test-load-damn-you/
<Dismo> Ohshit, There he is
*Phase4 hugs Dismo and LadyCanary
*LadyCanary ish hugged
*DeadpoolDash someone should stream "Under the Red Hood" sometime
<LadyCanary> I never saw that D:
<Placebo> Phase4: I realized the other day that my university has it's own Memesite. LOL
*Phase4 hugs Tik
<Polydunami> Dammit. LOAD
<Phase4> Placebo: lolwut?
<Phase4> thats awesome
<Placebo> Ikr?
<RAWRity> also something to avoid: Red Hood and the Outlaws or whatever it's called.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<flutter_spin> I'm just not happy --- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r1CZTLk-Gk
*DeadpoolDash the movie was pretty damn awesome
<LadyCanary> Never heard of that.
<RAWRity> because jesus christ was that an unnecessary book to bring up.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: it's better known as the book where Starfire is rebooted as a sex kitten with a transparent bikini and sleeps with every guy who makes eye contact with her.
<LadyCanary> ....
<LadyCanary> NO.
<Midnight_Tempest> wait... wut?
*DeadpoolDash Starfire has always been a sex symbol
<flutter_spin> Teen Titans Starfire ^^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and that had the same misfortune to be release along Catwoman
<Dismo> Anypony wanna come play Tf2 LfD2 or Gmod with me? Or Saints Row 3. On steam, Of course.
<RAWRity> DeadpoolDash: yes, but she also was actually capable of having emotional connections with people, and her sexuality was part of her personality. Now she's basically the to flash cleavage and taint.
<LadyCanary> TT_TT WHYYY STARFIRE.
<Polydunami> Okay, RAWRity, that is way too contrived for my taste
<Midnight_Tempest> hmm... i shoud get back to killing everyone in the Mojave... lurk mode... ACTIVATE!
<Polydunami> I mean, WAY too contrived
<LadyCanary> RAWRity: I am sad now. TT_TT
<RoseyPony> hmm feel the power http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBSpcS0tXv4
*DeadpoolDash most female characters are like that in comics, especially DCs
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: ah yes, Catwoman, where for 5 pages, we don't even see her face. Plenty of shots of her cleavage and ass though. But out heroine's face? who needs it!
<LadyCanary> ....
*LadyCanary rages.
<Placebo> Dat Canary rage.
<GabeMoist> Nothing is more frightening than a raging canary
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep

<GabeMoist> Ohai Saxy
*flutter_spin randomly begins to pick a happy pic
<flutter_spin> http://rofldoctor.deviantart.com/art/Luna-Booped-287796717
<RAWRity> DeadpoolDash: In the hands of poor writers they are, but there are tons of strong female characters in the DC universe, and comics in general, but often times get relegated to fanservice because the editors are convinced that the way to be succesful is appeal to teenage boys who only want explosions and tits.
<Dismo> LadyCanary: c: Calm down, We shall be wedded soon.
<LadyCanary> Is LadyCanary gonna have to dropkick a bitch?
<GabeMoist> ...yes
<Phase4> flutter_spin: *boop*
<LadyCanary> Dismo: My heart belongs to Ollie.
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: ollie?
<Placebo> Oh, heating pad. How glorious thou feel.
<Polydunami> Dang it, I want to poke Luna's snout now. SO CUTE
<LadyCanary> Green Arrow.
<Dismo> LadyCanary: ;-; .... Pshaw
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: ah.
*DeadpoolDash the characterization of the Teen Titans in the animated show never really matched up with their comic counter parts, since the animated series were actually Teens not Young Adults
<LadyCanary> Oliver Queen.
<Placebo> Who?
<LadyCanary> I hope to find an Oliver Queen of my own someday ^_^
<flutter_spin> But Teen Titans was a good show on its own. It may not have held the comic-style but it definitely was good story telling
<LadyCanary> Green Arrow, Placebo
<Placebo> Who?
<ThatsAShinySkyi> Hey yall
<RAWRity> DeadpoolDash: I'm not talking about the disparity between Starfire in the comics and Starfire in the show. I'm talking about the difference between her Characterization in older Teen Titans comics as compared to her current inarnation in the New 52
<Dismo> LadyCanary: If it's any help. I really like the Green Arrow :c
<LadyCanary> XD
<RAWRity> Dismo: I'm afraid you'll always just be the Speedy to her true Green Arrow
<Dismo> :~;
<LadyCanary> D'aw RAWRity.
<Placebo> I used to like LadyCanary, then I took a green arrow to the knee.
<Phase4> we need a stream
*DeadpoolDash she was a model in the old comics and was often drawn nude back then
<Phase4> DeadpoolDash: dem /me's
<RAWRity> though trust me, you don't want to be Arsenal. It doesn't end well.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh boy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14THAT can of worms
*DeadpoolDash me me me me me me me
<RAWRity> DeadpoolDash: yes, but she still had an endearing character to back it up. Now she's there to just be a sex pinup.
<LadyCanary> Which dissapoints me.
<Phase4> SaxyPretender: which worms?
*DeadpoolDash what did you really expect from a reboot, something good?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14what happened to Arsenal
<LadyCanary> She's a strong female character. Hell, she even partnered with animal man at a certain point.
<Placebo> Are we talking about female super heros?
<RAWRity> Because really, while I'm not a big fan of fanservice, if there's good writing ot back it up, then I'm fine with it.
<RAWRity> Placebo: yes.
<Placebo> O.rite.
<Placebo> Sex appeal.
<Placebo> Quite.
<Phase4> SaxyPretender: what happened? and who/whats arsenal?
<flutter_spin> http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/09/22/starfire-catwoman-sex-superheroine
<RAWRity> DeadpoolDash: Yes, actually. Seeing as there HAVE been good titles to come out of the reboot.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Arsenal was Green Arrow's sidekick
<Dismo> Female SuperHeros? ;w; LadyCanary Is my saviour~ :I
<Polydunami> Same here. Fanservice for the sake of fanservice really doesn't do it for me
<SaxyPretender> 0,14who had a pretty sweet life
<SaxyPretender> 0,14he had a daughter, kicked an old drug habit and was an accepted super hero
<TrixieMuffin> Arsenal is Green arrows ex sidekick , gone batshit crazy and drug addict
<LadyCanary> .///. O-oh my Dismo.
<RAWRity> and then Cry For Justice happened!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14until one comic
<Dismo> Dat blushing LadyCanary :3
<Polydunami> I want female superheroes
<SaxyPretender> 0,14in the span of one comic, he lost all his good things
<RAWRity> and THEN Rise of Arsenal happened!
<Placebo> I don't need superheroes, I have ponies.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dead daughter, arm ripped off, and back to drugs
<LadyCanary> SUPERHERO ponies.
*DeadpoolDash I only pay attention to DC for the animated stuff, games, and toys. Their comics have never really sold me.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, he became a villain
<TrixieMuffin> but ponieshave superheroes
<TrixieMuffin> Mare do well
*DeadpoolDash I pretty much just do Marvel for the comics
<LadyCanary> http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrt13gBblf1qjqeiyo1_500.jpg Placebo, I did that with pony creator :3
<Polydunami> Mare-do-well was a gambit
<RAWRity> Seriously, Arsenal got kicked in the nuts with steel-toed boots.
<Placebo> LadyCanary: I've seen it. It was up when Wrek drew you :3
<LadyCanary> ^^"
<Phase4> SaxyPretender: O_O
<LadyCanary> She is my waifu.
<Polydunami> I'd say Mare-do-well has similarities with Batman
*DeadpoolDash although both are quite guilty for one dimensional characterization of females. It just seems like Marvel handles it better or jokes about it.
<Phase4> SaxyPretender: the hell happened?
<Placebo> Who's a pretty pony? :D
<LadyCanary> I dunn.
<RAWRity> oh! I forgot about an aspect!
<Polydunami> Placebo: ;)
<Placebo> o.o
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Phase4: a bad writer and mini-event
<Phase4> makes sense
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, I'm off to bed for now
<RAWRity> At the end of the first issue of New 52 Catwoman, she and Batman have in-costume, on-panel sex on the roof of a building.
<RAWRity> Because that makes total sense.

<MahBoi777> HELP ME
<Placebo> I get kicked by kirz for mentioning Justin Beiber, and we're having a Rebecca Black Karoke night? REeally?
<MahBoi777> someone please
<RAWRity> Polydunami: shhhh, gabe and I are having a moment.
*Shizuka 13is only partially looking forward to the weekend...
<GabeMoist> new pony ep this weekend
*Midnight_Tempest is looking forward at the screen
<Placebo> Shizuka: has colors even in the /me text o.o
<Polydunami> I'm getting a whiff of hypocrisy here
<Polydunami> :)
<Polydunami> ^__^
<MahBoi777> Placebo: u got kicked for mentioning *insert ban reason here*?
<Placebo> Justin Bieber is best pony
<Polydunami>
*Placebo throws up flame shield
*Midnight_Tempest explodes
<RAWRity> So you know what happened at the Oscars? Billy Crystal, in blackface, dressed as Sammy Davis Jr., called Beiber "The New Sinatra"
<Polydunami> If I have nothing nice to say...
<Polydunami>
<Dismo> So nopony wants to play videogames with me on steam? I'm about to go on netflix if no responce.
<Midnight_Tempest> beiber... the new sinatra... i dont wanna live on this planet anymore...
<RAWRity> also, Chris Rock said that being a voice actor is super easy and takes no effort.
<Placebo> Dismo: What ya playin?
<GabeMoist> RAWRity, seems legit
<MahBoi777> well if Chris Rock said it, then it must be true
<Placebo> Silly Chris Rock, Tom is best rock.
<Dismo> Placebo: l4d2 tf2 Gmod. or SR3
*Midnight_Tempest decides he's going to divide the music industry by 0...
<RAWRity> This prompted Tara Strong to order her 20,000 Twitter Followers to flame him. She has now challenged him to Mudwrestling.
<Placebo> Midnight_Tempest: And that's how JB was made~
<GabeMoist> but RAWRity, being a voice actor IS easy, being a good voice actor is a different sotry
<Polydunami> sic
<Midnight_Tempest> we could all be VA's... being a good one... that takes time and effort... T_T i wanna be a VA...
<RAWRity> GabeMoist: no, it's not easy. It's still a shit ton of work, even if you SUCK.
<RAWRity> Midnight_Tempest: no, we couldn't. We could TRY to be VAs, but 99% of us would fail miserably.
<Midnight_Tempest> but at least we would have tried...
*DeadpoolDash I would like to be a VA, but my normal voice is kind of naselly
<MahBoi777> wait....who's the 1%?
<Polydunami> <_<
<Midnight_Tempest> MLP VA's...
<Dumorimasoddaa> VAing is slightly easyer than plane acting in the acting part
<GabeMoist> Steve Blum is the 1%
<Polydunami> >_>
<Dumorimasoddaa> But it's harder with the getting ones voice right part
<RAWRity> MahBoi777: well, statistically speaking, we'd have 1 person here who's a decent VA
<Dumorimasoddaa> Less stress to it though
*DeadpoolDash steve blum does the same voice almost all the time.
<Midnight_Tempest> RAWRity: would that be Wrek... or prince-dari?
<GabeMoist> Steve Blum has done different voices though
*DeadpoolDash the good VAs have lots of range
<RAWRity> I will say that Voice Acting is comparitively easier than on-screen acting, but it is by no means an easy job.
<Dumorimasoddaa> ^
<Dumorimasoddaa> It's easyer than on screen as one you can the script
*DeadpoolDash all emotes have to be done through voice, you can't eyebrow act as a VA
<Polydunami> I could the script
<Placebo> I accidently the whole script.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Learning ones lines is always most tedious
*GabeMoist just accidentally the entire script
<Placebo> GabeMoist: ninja.
<GabeMoist> Placebo, Pirates are better
<Placebo> Mm, I'm thinkingi Minutemen.
<Placebo> Or Spartans.
<RAWRity> It's less physically taxing, yes, but it still takes tons of talent and hard work to be succesful at it. Unless you're a celebrity. Then they'll just give you the job regardless of ability. See: Chris Rock
<Dumorimasoddaa> Space pirate super sentai are the best
<MahBoi777> Spartans
<GabeMoist> Pirate ninja minutemen from Sparta
<Placebo> ^^^
<Placebo> Wait.. Pirate Ninjas? Or Ninja pirate?
<MahBoi777> Football playing king in space
<Placebo> JOHN MADDEN
<Dumorimasoddaa> They can be ninjas and samurai and mistics and are still pirates from space

<Phase4> Placebo: aeiou
<GabeMoist> Witch pirate detectives

<PinkieSpice> Sumica: no, i will lose the abily to have a logical disucsion and turn into mindless whinning with no reasoning
<Phase4> night Midnight_Tempest
<Sumica> 00,10wait, they are sticking around to watch the heros die?
<MahBoi777> gnight Midnight_Tempest! take care
<MahBoi777> WOAH

<PinkieSpice> Sumica: in other words, a rarity
<Phase4> did he break a leak
<Sumica> 00,10shinie purple
<Phase4> leek'
<Kencolt> Hey- the SUperman, Lanter etc weren't any better at the time.
<Stray> Riddler needs a friend...:(
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: wihtout a off switch
<applejack096> Get lost batman
<MahBoi777> WOAH, the villains never stay for the hero's demise
<Phase4> humph
<Phase4> MahBoi777: aparently not, even when they planed to
<Sumica> 00,10lets leave all barrles open.
<MahBoi777> it's a rule, lol
<Kencolt> By God. That's the formula for Kool-Aid.
<PinkieSpice> wait what?
<Phase4> about to be dipped into hot wax? time for chemestry, we need an explosion
<Stray> If you don't leave barrels open, then how will you swim?
<PinkieSpice> why would they have something highly explosive with heat with a factory that has big sources of heat?
<Sumica> 00,10if only they could swing.
<OtakuTom> why don't they just start swinging back and forth to...y'know...avoid the wax pool
<Phase4> PinkieSpice: so batman can escape of course
<MahBoi777> I was about to say SWING U FOOLS, lol
<Phase4> its one of the things in the building code, all things must be bat friendly
<Sumica> 00,10aime with the bat buldge.
<Mutterguy> they would but Robin is to young according to state law
<Stray> He nearly blinded the riddler! XD
<PinkieSpice> thats it
<Phase4> which caused them to fall into the wax, the end
<PinkieSpice> it must be a world without safty inspectors
<Sumica> 00,10seems the compression wave killed them.
<Phase4> look at him go
<OtakuTom> okay...HOW did that free them from the rope?
<Stray> :D explosions
<Kencolt> Way to go, Mister "You must learn to control your emotions".
<Phase4> riddler has had to much coffee
<applejack096> lol
<Julia> a little sunlight blows up barrels, I have to keep that in mind :[
<MahBoi777> OtakuTom: simple.....magic
<PinkieSpice> they either all died out, or there wasn't enough logic for saftey inspectors to exist in that world
<OtakuTom> But...this isn't Equestria...
<Sumica> 00,10you must reflect it with a highly polished belt buckle.
<Mutterguy> *snort* *snort*
<Phase4> inb4 they are not dead

<Mutterguy> so magic is canon
<Sumica> 00,10they are dead again?!
<Stray> Yeah, how do you think he got his freaking bat powers Mutterguy?
<Mutterguy> why not commit crime Away from Gotham City
<PinkieSpice> Sumica: .... wait, it just took a little sunlight to set it off? and yet they placed it in a room with a window?
<Phase4> a fridge?
<MahBoi777> WOAH
<Stray> hmm...
<OtakuTom> I was just gonna say a hamster in a wheel...lol
<Phase4> a fridge has 4 legs and runs day and night
<Sumica> 00,10dick use the damn door.
<Mutterguy> well i was being naive and assumed it was just his high calibre of skill and cunning
<Spanner-pony> 4 legs, runs day and night but never gets anywhere.
<Stray> The answer is probably derpy
<Phase4> fridges dont move
<Sumica> 00,10answer bat phone> ask who it is.
<Stray> Derpy with her wings duct-taped.
<MahBoi777> here's a suggestion Mayor, SEND BACKUP DAMNIT
<Mutterguy> CHECK THE PULSE YOU DOLT!
<Sumica> 00,10......
<Mutterguy> A race!
<OtakuTom> Robin wasn't on the phone...how did he know what the riddle was without Batman saying it beforehand?
<Sumica> 00,10man they jump to conclusions fast.
<PinkieSpice> ...
<Mutterguy> a race has legs
*PinkieSpice bashes his head in
<Spanner-pony> A fountain with 4 legs.
<Phase4> Mutterguy: but it gets somewhere
<OtakuTom> Yea...jumping to conclusions is Batman's superpower in this series.
<Stray> Matches Malone

<OtakuTom> That's the point.
*RainbowcrashNBurn finally remembers which final fantasy this is showing
<RoseyPony> the only final fantasy villain to actually acomplish what he sought out to do
<Polydunami> Oh who am I kidding, FMA was published by the same company I think

<Polydunami> This is the Japanese otaku's national anthem xD
<OtakuTom> I gotta make sure I still remember the whole song so I can start a singalong of it at ACEN in 8 weeks.
<Polydunami> I remember my friend showing me this video
<Sumica> 00,10Sad thing is I know most of the songs
<Lunarletic> Sumica here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHpkMiulH84 <--- instrumental version
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, It's Haruhi Suzumiya
<Sumica> 00,10what you dont like the niconico singers?
<OtakuTom> There's a lot more than Haruhi in it.
<Lunarletic> instrumental is nice repeatable
<Polydunami> I know that, I've seen this show
<Polydunami> *video
<Paradise92> oh lol
<Paradise92> i haven't
<Paradise92> watched this
<Paradise92> in a long time
<OtakuTom> I love automatic mario vids
<Paradise92> this is really epic video
<RainbowcrashNBurn> been two years since i watch this
<Lunarletic> HA NA SE@!
<RaveBrony> This is amazing! :o
<Stray> These things always left me speechless
<Polydunami> I remember when Super Mario RPG was still new
<RainbowcrashNBurn> this video single handedly led me to playing all the games featured as part of this
<Sumica> 00,10the video was rather epic even before set to automatic mario
<Stray> okkusenman
<Paradise92> this is Mario 3 correct?
<Polydunami> I didn't even know what an rpg was and I thought it was Super Mario 64 for some reason
*Lunarletic nods
<OtakuTom> Super Mario World
<Sumica> 00,10mario world
<Polydunami> And this is Super Mario World I think
<Polydunami> Yeah
<Sumica> 00,10uninstall uninstall
<Polydunami> And this is hacked, just so you know
<Lunarletic> i should watch bokurano again
<Kencolt> How do people THINK of these things?
<BronyinJapan> Air Awesome Anime
<OtakuTom> I still need to get the last volume of Air...
<Sumica> 00,10it's japan
<OtakuTom> I have DVDs 1-3 and the movie...
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, I've never seen AIR but I've seen Kanon and Clannad
<Stray> How does anyone think of ANYTHING? Don't underestimate people's brains, people.
<Sumica> 00,10dat precious thing
<Paradise92> imagine how much work this for this to be done properly
<BronyinJapan> Polydunami Clanned made me cry
<Lunarletic> wistful sigh Key stuff
<OtakuTom> I still haven't watched Clannad.
<BronyinJapan> :O
<OtakuTom> I've got so much I'm currently watching still...
<OtakuTom> I have over 550 anime DVDs in my collection...I've watched over 400 of them.
<Sumica> 00,10How about some epic anime after this?
<RoseyPony> hmm i recommend higurashi to anyone who can handle the insanity of it
<Polydunami> Clannad brought me close to crying
<BronyinJapan> yes
<RainbowcrashNBurn> if i remember correctly....each "screen" had a sprite limit, so this would have to find perfect timing to change screen to refresh sprite allowance
<Stray> I just wanna watch Black Jack the surgeon for some reason.
<Sumica> 00,10DCD shows that
<Polydunami> Black Jack is awesome
<Paradise92> i need another anime...currently watching Naruto,Bleach,Fairy Tail....but since Naruto and Bleach are gonna be going to a stop soon...i need something else...any suggestions?
<BronyinJapan> PoseyPony it, have you seen When The Seagulls Cry its by the same people
<Sumica> 00,10"God knows"
<RoseyPony> hmm no but i know of it
<Starflash> Paradise92 hitman reborn & one piece?
<Lunarletic> i guess i'm delayed by 10 secs
<Sumica> 00,10"lucky star"
<RoseyPony> i have the VN
<BronyinJapan> Paradise92 have you seen One Piece
<Polydunami> I've never seen that
<Paradise92> hitman reborn i've been thinking of it...
<Sumica> 00,10Xenopetain
<Starflash> its pretty cool.
<Paradise92> but one piece i'm upset a bit
<Polydunami> I couldn't get into Reborn
<Lunarletic> yay xenopittan :)
<Sumica> 00,10Age of aqueariaon
<OtakuTom> Yea, I don't have any good shonen anime to recommend....I'm sad that Bleach is ending in 4 episodes :(
<RoseyPony> one piece has an insane amount of episodes
<Lunarletic> yea
<Polydunami> I know it gets better, but still
<Paradise92> OtakuTom it isn't ending in 4 episodes
<Stray> Sumica, think you could link me to the place that plays Black Jack the Surgeon?
<Starflash> Its really something you need to get into, yeah
<Polydunami> RoseyPony, it's worth it
<Starflash> and the manga is way better than the anime
<Paradise92> OtakonTom manga started the last chapter...after that it is the end of Bleach
<Sumica> 00,10this is the place, just a diffrent streamer.
<dshannon> WHAT!
<BronyinJapan> Whos seen Code Geass
<dshannon> fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuq!
<Lunarletic> lololo tsurupettan
<RaveBrony> i have

<Sumica> 00,10R3 is due to come out soon.
<dshannon> qeue spike nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!
<Polydunami> Anyway, yeah, I've seen about 3/4 of season 1
<BronyinJapan> Gotta go bye every pony:(
<Polydunami> And I've spoiled myself
<OtakuTom> Yea, I know the manga is still going, but the anime itself is ending in 4 episodes. It may come back once they have enough to run through the whole final arc, but that's actually unknown if it is.
<RoseyPony> bye
<d3rb> bye BronyinJapan
<Stray> One Piece will continue to become stranger until it becomes completely ordinary.
<RoseyPony> the 2 year skips marks the halfway point of the story
<Stray> Bye BronyinJapan
<Polydunami> He's gone
*Stray is too slow
<Paradise92> One Piece is just bullshit....i am sry One Piece fans but i tried to watch it...watched 50 episodes of it and still can't like it...
<Paradise92> maybe cause of the way it is drawn
<RoseyPony> its all opinion
<Paradise92> or i hate the characters...
<OtakuTom> I'm not into One Piece, either.
<Paradise92> but something with One Piece i just don't understand
<RaveBrony> I wasnt a fan of One Piece either :\
<Sumica> 00,10it has way too much padding for my likeing.
<dshannon> wait what?
<Sumica> 00,10mind you I wont play the whole thing but it's still epic.
<Stray> I am cursed to ALWAYS hear the 4kids dub while reading the manga...
<RoseyPony> hmm how about elfen lied anyone?
<Starflash> Didnt like that one. Too blunt
<Paradise92> the only thing i liked about one piece is the marine war
<RaveBrony> I never saw that, is it good? I heard alot of things :D
<Polydunami> Is it Monster? I loved that show
<RoseyPony> hmm it was interesting if you could handle the first 10 minutes of the first episode
<Starflash> if you like blood all over the place, you'll love elfen lied
<Polydunami> Nope
<RaveBrony> o.o
<Paradise92> hahah
<Stray> oh HECK YEAH THIS

<Polydunami> And Elfen Lied? I've only read the manga

<OtakuTom> Sadly, this episode was Pre-Grant
<Lunarletic> yea
<MrBronyface> mr bean! :D
<RawketLawnchair> Misah Bean.
<Lunarletic> any quirks in win8?
<pony_2890> pedobear
<Onyxiaz> ah now i can see the vid ;o
<dr-whooves> no quirks
<OtakuTom> I can't wait to test Win8, just waiting to rebuild my PC first and set up virtual PCs
<MrBronyface> that sounded wrong
<Dark_Horst> give your kids into the caring hands of the mythbusters.... sound sane
<Ninjazz> ...
<dr-whooves> it works just nothing revolutionary
<dr-whooves> I'll stick to xp
<pony_2890> i stick to 7
<Onyxiaz> lolwut
<dr-whooves> I shoul be doing school, fuck that i have you guys
<Sumica> 00,10I just finaly gave up on XP.
<Derpy101> ooo mythbusters
<Lunarletic> I use 7 x64 seems fine compatibility wise
<Sumica> 00,10it gave me issues in streaming.
<Dark_Horst> can someone tell me why the chrome adblock wond fucking work?
<pony_2890> l4d2 doesent work for me
<dr-whooves> really i have used XP for 9 years
<Onyxiaz> pony_2890 : same here =\
<Sumica> 00,10cause it's crome.
<OtakuTom> It's working for me no problem. I'm running Chrome, no ads whatsoever.
<Lunarletic> dr-whooves: same I just started 7 a year and a half...or was it a year
<Lunarletic> ago
<pony_2890> compatibility issues when i close steam and you?
<Lunarletic> nope
<Sumica> 00,10all the balls
<pony_2890> only after i play l4d2
<Dark_Horst> i keep getting the covering ads in the stream
<Onyxiaz> bawlz
<pony_2890> add block plus ftw
<dr-whooves> ^
<Lunarletic> yea
<Lunarletic> adblock+ ftw
<Sumica> 00,10yep abp rules
<Dark_Horst> i have adblock
<Dark_Horst> that's the problem
<pony_2890> then stop using chrome
<Sumica> 00,10adblock+ and noscript are a must.
<OtakuTom> I ran the Vista beta and loved it, then the real version came out and I had a ton of problems. I then switched to the Win7 beta and used that in place of Vista. I've had the release version of 7 pretty much since day 1 and only recently started to experience crashes.
<Lunarletic> well i still have the old old issue of closing explorer process while playing old games
<Dark_Horst> my firefox wont work
<Onyxiaz> keeps laggin =\
<MrBronyface> chromr sucks with adblock
<Dark_Horst> i wouldnt be using chrome if it did
<MrBronyface> fire fox ftw
<Dark_Horst> connection issues alll the t
<Lunarletic> mine is smooth and installing win7 is fun
<Dark_Horst> ime
<Lunarletic> so fast
<pony_2890> i dont like chrome
<Onyxiaz> ow for
<Onyxiaz> -____-
<Lunarletic> i use firefox for addon compatibility....eats alot of mem tho
<pony_2890> i think you can costumize ff better
<Lunarletic> not a prob though
<OtakuTom> I like Chrome more than FF. FF is always real slow for me, even with almost no addons.
<dr-whooves> i like XP its been stable for years if you have an older OS or a touch pc then go for it
<Ninjazz> i dont know why im watching this on my tiny ass computer screen while i got a huge tv next to me
<Wrek|Observing> 05i have the juice for ff to work fine, henceforth i use it
<Sumica> 00,10same here
<pony_2890> i have 7 pony personas
<pony_2890> mane 6 and derpy
<dr-whooves> ^
<dr-whooves> link plox
<pony_2890> what one
<Lunarletic> my ff only has adblock+/downloadhelper/download statusbar and ankpixiv
<dr-whooves> link to derpy persona please
<OtakuTom> I'm on my gaming machine, i7 processor, 16gb RAM
<pony_2890> what persona dr-whooves
<Onyxiaz> cool otakutom
<Lunarletic> well thats kinda obvious lol even though 16g ram seems overkill even at ultra quality
<dr-whooves> doesnt matter GIVE ME PONIES
<OtakuTom> Even then, FF runs slow
<dr-whooves> yah8 is fine for me
<d3rb> no such thing as overkill
<Sumica> 00,10"jamie hold my balls"
<pony_2890> https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/search/?q=My+Little+Pony+Friendship+is+magic&cat=personas&appver=&platform=

<pony_2890> :)
<OtakuTom> I'm studying 3D animation and game design, I need a good computer to be able to run things like Maya and UDK.
<Dark_Horst> welp, lessee if reinstalling solves the ff problem
<Vallu> :)
<pony_2890> what graphics card do you have?
<dr-whooves> raedon 4350
<OtakuTom> I have 2 nVidia GeForce GTX 460's in SLI.
<pony_2890> Nvidia geforce 560 ti
<pony_2890> from MSI
<Onyxiaz> i bet my pc is the worst
<dr-whooves> ATI or NVIDIA
<pony_2890> i said nvidia
<dr-whooves> nah man ati
<OtakuTom> I'll be upgrading my video cards later on...probably a few months after I build the new rig. I want to upgrade my MB, CPU, and RAM first.
<dr-whooves> id love to have a nice rig but im poor as shit
<pony_2890> i want a pony game on steam
<Sumica> 00,10Frys is your friend.
<OtakuTom> I'm an nvidia guy. I've never had any luck with ATI.
<Lunarletic> yea
<Lunarletic> Fry ftw
<dr-whooves> nvidia gave me nothing but trouble
<Vallu> I can't wait until Fighting is magic is finished :)
<dr-whooves> ^
<Onyxiaz> are there any pony games tho ;o
<pony_2890> never played it
<Onyxiaz> i kno fighting is magic... but
<OtakuTom> Fry's is okay, but I use either Newegg or Micro Center.
<Appledash> are there any pony games? apart from flash games?
<Sumica> 00,10saw some kinda harvist moon game the other day.

<OtakuTom> Exactly! I think MLP is perfect for that genre.
<OtakuTom> Tons of different minigames
<Sumica> 00,10just think of the minigames
<pony_2890> i want a portal to equestria instead
<Vallu> I think story game would be better
<Onyxiaz> pony_2890 : you should talk to pinkie pie.. she knows about portals
<pony_2890> dear pinkie pie break that 4th wall allready
<OtakuTom> The first one I thought of was "Don't Feed the Parasprites", where you're supposed to keep the Parasprites from food at the Cake's Bakery.

<Lunarletic> Lesson Zero is awesome but Twi's insanity @ S01E10 was priceless
<RawketLawnchair> This isn't working.
<OtakuTom> I think my favorite episode has got to be the one where Fluttershy is babysitting the CMC. Her squee when telling them about the Shh game made me the happiest brony ever.
<d3rb> yaeah aus brony
<Sumica> 00,10Vegas woo.

<Meanwhile> TARDIS is more technologically advanced than your silly magic black hole orbiting asteroid.
<alexxm> i'm good F1uttershy
<prince-dari> If I could travel in time.
<prince-dari> Watching a TV show would not be on my list of things to do.
<prince-dari> Ever.
<Meanwhile> ^
<thatgrumpygit5150> even if it was ponies?
<MrBronyface> not even mlp :o
<flutter_spin> dat music
<prince-dari> I think I would probably forget ponies even exist.
<Cobellanez> :(
<prince-dari> If I had a time machine.
<EspyLacopa> I'd be tempted to first, get massive money through shenanigans, and then get a super-powerful future computer for gaming on.
<Iwubponiez> go everywhere yaaaaay
<Jim> but you don't, so therefore poni poni poni
<EspyLacopa> Assuming I could get past the burning hatred I have for time travel and don't just destroy the time machine first.
<prince-dari> Yeah Jim.
<prince-dari> XD
<Nugget21> ^-^ I Would learn tomorrows lottery numbers get the expasion pack for skyrim and get every ep of mlp then destory the time machine
<Meanwhile> If I had a time machine you'd never hear from me again.
<Meanwhile> Sorry can't hear you I'm playing pirate with Blackbeard.
<thatgrumpygit5150> suddenly, abrupt music stop
<GalaPonyslide> And this is according to EST time right?
<prince-dari> First thing I would do with a time machine is go to the future, get technology to fix all the shit that's wrong with the world today.
*flutter_spin whispers: "Do you have any milk"
<Cobellanez> DOOM
<qwdasdcfsg> If I had a time machine I would have a time machine. ._.

<flutter_spin> I would build a time machine and then go back in time and give it to myself *mind blown*
<thatgrumpygit5150> am I the only one who finds it funny that this ep is a better representation of Doom than the movie was?
<Iwubponiez> nugget21 : how you plan to do that by time travel?
<qwdasdcfsg> then you wold have two time machines!
<Meanwhile> KwakLad: What a dull idea. I could do anything I wanted in all of time and I'd go back far enough to set myself up as a deity? foolishness.
<Jim> Casual converstation
<prince-dari> The best and his armies will rise from the pit to make war with God.
<GalaPonyslide> If I had a time machine...paradoxes, paradoxes everywhere.
<prince-dari> beast*
