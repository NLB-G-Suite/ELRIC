<Shizuka> 13except when it stands for non-PG-13
<Shy> again, if you want link to my other tumblr then PM me
<Midnight_Tempest> lol, my OC is male

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I live in PA.
<Saturn> 8,1i will bring you some scottish beer! \o/
<LordCelestia> 0,5otakon He wasnt leaving he was saying help silly
<RAWRity> [$(5)$]

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Bronystate at BroNYcon July 2012?
<RAWRity> I'M RICH!

<LordCelestia> 0,5No but really I cant have someone in my house, I am but a 16 year old >_<
<Shizuka> 13why your PHP no work
<MirrorImage> Saturn: ...nevermind then
<RAWRity> highjack a plain: free flights anywhere.
<RAWRity> *plane
<otakon> damn it
<MirrorImage> though i have heard reports that the best time to book flights is 6 weeks before the flight itself
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have a place in PA, but I'm not certain that I'll still be here come BroNYcon time.
<otakon> why did my flash crash again?
<Yahooz> back...
<MirrorImage> so there'll probably be better offers appearing in April or May
<Saturn> 8,1but i might be looking in the wrong places
<RAWRity> MirrorImage: that's correct.
<Saturn> 8,1LordCelestia: just say i'm a... immigrant slave?
<Saturn> 8,1i dunno
<Yahooz> I always book a good 2-3 months before flights
<Yahooz> maybe thats a tad early
<LordCelestia> 0,5x3
<Saturn> 8,1anyhoos, yeah, my budget is as little as i can spend, what's accomodation pricing like in new york for hostels?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I happen to still be in State College, I have an apt and State College has an airport.
<Yahooz> ...
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord: yeah, but State College is... what, a 8-hour drive to Boston?
<pinkydash> hYAHOOZ
<LadyCanary> D:
<pinkydash> iS BACK
<MirrorImage> heck, i live in Pittsburgh and i know that'd be a decent drive alone
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. I'm about to calculate times.
<pinkydash> YAHOOZ
<Saturn> 8,1okay, looks like accomodation shouldn't be a problem
<Midnight_Tempest> i would love to go to any brony related cons... but i has no moneh
<Yahooz> someone fill me in... what are we talking about exactly?
<Saturn> 8,1now all i need to do is build a gigantic catapulty
<pinkydash> no idea
<Dken2021> oh look it's that other alicorn
<LawnchairRawket> I want to avoid all the spaghetti flowing at a Bronycon.
<LawnchairRawket> That would just be silly.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01New York is only 4 hours 13 mins from State College.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I-99 to I-80 straight there.
<Yahooz> Oh BroNycon travel. XD I live like 30 mins away from the city
<Kimori> yep
<pinkydash> dat Yahooz
<pinkydash> so lucky
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I might or might not go to BroNYcon. I'm not a con person, and I'm going to be moving around the end of June.
<Midnight_Tempest> i will now develope teleportation so all bronies can reach BroNycon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because I'm graduating this Spring.
<LadyCanary> :O Oh wow!
<pinkydash> or create a interdimensional portal
<Yahooz> cool ^_^
<pinkydash> so we can get the Pegasus to give us a lift
<LawnchairRawket> Open the portal jump in.
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm 6 hours from the Big apple.
<Dashie_Dashie> debating on going
<LadyCanary> I wants to go to bronycon...so that I can cosplay and stuff :D
<otakon> Dashie_Dashie: you can do it!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cosplay as gala ponies!
<LawnchairRawket> Take pictures, LadyCanary
<otakon> yeah
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I take Rainbow Dash.
<otakon> I'd like to go too
<LadyCanary> Nittany_Discord: OH GOD. I WISH
<otakon> but I has no monies atm
<RAWRity> I want to go to Bronycon so I can meet you guys!
<LadyCanary> If only I had the skills ;^;
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Though you better grab eye bleach.
<NewDCD> 9,1Wish I had the time and resources for a decent cosplay...
<Yahooz> Im definently going to BroNYcon. I hope to see as much of Bronystate there as possible :)
<Ingwaz> same dcd
<LadyCanary> Hello NewDCD ^_^
<LawnchairRawket> I am going to stay far far away from any Bronycon.
<LadyCanary> i just wish I could sew.
<Yahooz> ohey newDCD
<Midnight_Tempest> new plan... win lottery and buy personal jet to fly around the world meeting ALL the bronies
<Ingwaz> i'm definitely not going to bronycon, i dont have the money
<LawnchairRawket> Faaaaaaaaar away.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If we could get a bronystate panel, that would be interesting.
<LadyCanary> Amaaazing!
<LadyCanary> :3
<Yahooz> IKR
<Ingwaz> Midnight_Tempest....i dont even think the lottery would have enough funds for you to meet all the bronies
<Dashie_Dashie> Confound these ponies, I'll be back in an hours or two.
<Yahooz> That would be epic
<RAWRity> LawnchairRawket: why?
<Yahooz> or at the very least a group meet-up
<LawnchairRawket> Because I'm antisocial and I hate cons and oh my god that would just be embarrasing.
<kyle113> Sorry I got nothing to say...yet that is haha
<LadyCanary> Awww.
<Yahooz> so why are you here?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Me: Mom, look, I'm internet famous. Mom: What for? Me: A pony convention!
<Midnight_Tempest> Ingwaz: Then I will make them have enough funds... its for the good of the land!
<LawnchairRawket> I always hide my power level whenever I go outside.
<LawnchairRawket> Going to a con like that would be like going SS3
<Yahooz> then dont
<LadyCanary> I'm very shy. Heck, when I was Black Canary, I was still my shy self ._.
<LawnchairRawket> That's just ridiclious.
<RAWRity> LawnchairRawket: but you would be among fellow antisocial embarassed nerds! You could revel with your compatriots!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, like I said, I'm truly not a convention person.
<pinkydash> BRONYCON
<LawnchairRawket> I'd rather not.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I figure conventions are for the high-end fans.
<pinkydash> maybe it's time to go to the neighbouring country to the sotuh
<Dken2021> I never went to any kind of con, but wish to go to one
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: wait wait wait...you cosplayed as Black Canary?
<pinkydash> south*
<LawnchairRawket> Only so much spaghetti can fit in one room.
<Ingwaz> i wouldnt mind conventions, but i dont have th money for the hotel, travel fees, and all the money i would want to spend on the merch
<pinkydash> for the first time in my life xD
<LawnchairRawket> That, and I can't get to NY easily.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I'm introverted.
<LawnchairRawket> And I have no money.
<Yahooz> LawnchairRawket: I would go if I were you. You get to meet people that share the same interest as you, and so many of them are great people in general.
<Ingwaz> so i'll probably just do as i did during the last convention, stay home all day and watch the livestream
<LadyCanary> That I did RAWRity. Mind you, I dont think I did a fantastic job on it, but I was proud
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But BroNYCon looked fun. Also, I knew someone who went.
<Ingwaz> i watched the livestream from like 10 am cst to 19:00 cst
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: that's AWESOME!
<LawnchairRawket> Thanks but no thanks Yahooz .
<Dken2021> yea go to it LawnchairRawket, if you can
<LawnchairRawket> I'm staying right here.
<pinkydash> :(
<LawnchairRawket> Faaaaaaaar away from all that nonsense.
<Pony_of_War> Fox made Brony con look stupid :(
<pinkydash> I'm with Yahooz on this
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He brought back a couple of good print including an awesome Rarity pic.
<Pony_of_War> They focused on the weird people
<Yahooz> that nonsense keeps the communtiy alive LawnchairRawket
<RAWRity> Pony_of_War: fox made itself look stupid.
<Pony_of_War> True...
<pinkydash> that's Fox for you
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Red Eye? Just a comedy show from what I hear.
<LadyCanary> Why Fox news would even BOTHER to cover that is beyond me.
<RAWRity> especially with what he said to Nicole Oliver.
<LawnchairRawket> Its not the right kind of community, if you ask me. But whatever.
<LadyCanary> Any other news station BUT FOX.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01LadyCanary: For Lulz.
<Pony_of_War> There are SOOOOO many awesome bronies out there
<Dken2021> news reaactions?]
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: slow news day, plus a chance to try and make fun of the "Weirdos"
<Pony_of_War> Why did they have to focus on the weird ones?
<pinkydash> meh, alot of these reports are Biased
<Yahooz> LawnchairRawket: Why are you even here if you dont like the community?
<Pony_of_War> Wrek's pony art, for instance
<pinkydash> or all that AMAZING MUSIC
<Midnight_Tempest> Fox News has to make fun of anything that they see as stupid... hence why John Stewart and Steve Colbert make fun of Fox all the time
<LawnchairRawket> Because I'm a masochist and some of the stuff streamed here is neat.
<RAWRity> The guy made himself look like an ass. He wasn't just messing with some of the weird fans, he was belittling professional Voice Actresses and altogether being a dickbag.
<LawnchairRawket> Beyond that, no real rasin.
<Yahooz> rasins are not real. canon
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs LawnchairRawket
<LawnchairRawket> Bluh.
<Pony_of_War> Like this - This art

<Pony_of_War> O.O
<Midnight_Tempest> fox news isnt professional, they are paid to say what their owners want them to say
<Pony_of_War> it's so good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Isn't all American news stations like that now?
<Pony_of_War> Pretty much
<Dken2021> some, not all
<Pony_of_War> Rebellion in Lybia? Buck that
<Dken2021> but mostly the ones that have slow news
<Pony_of_War> Kim Kardashian isn't married!
<Yahooz> CNN does whatever the fuq they want. Not in a good way
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: sort of.
<Pony_of_War> Who wants to hear about government overthrow?
<Kimori> lol
<Kimori> its ok
<Dken2021> I rather like CNN, they were tolerable
<Midnight_Tempest> oh me!
<RAWRity> Fox is bent towards the Right, MSNBC is bent towards the left, and CNN lets Twitter do the reporting for them these days.
<Yahooz> ^
<Pony_of_War> Obviously Kim Kardashian is more important than an ENTIRE BUCKING COUNTRY!
<Midnight_Tempest> CNN is the only news group that tries to tell you about the outside world... but not well enough
<Pony_of_War> <endrant<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't even know who Kim Kardashian is.
<LadyCanary> Eh, I just ignore that stuff, Pony_of_War.
<Pony_of_War> >
<Pony_of_War> I don't watch the news
<Pony_of_War> There'd have to be news
<LadyCanary> It's not worth complaining over.
<RAWRity> also, we have a channel called "Headline News" that reports almost exclusively on celebrity relationships.
<Midnight_Tempest> i ignore everything... ignorance is bliss
<Yahooz> soooo while we are talking about modern day stuff, who is going to win the super bowl?
<Pony_of_War> Giants
<RAWRity> Yahooz: Giants
<Midnight_Tempest> no one cause super bowl is dumb
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01News to me became war and women's health, so I stopped watching.
<Yahooz> I say Dorritos
<Pony_of_War> IMO I don't care but meh awesome friend doesn't like the pats (und she's a girl :))
<Midnight_Tempest> the Sponsors win the super bowl every year
*Nittany_Discord 11,01doesn't care about the Super Bowl unless his team in it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*is
<LadyCanary> What's your team
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Panthers.
<LadyCanary> Ah.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: ouch.
<LunaTheBeloved> Falcons didn't make it so.....Go Patriots!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Yahooz> thats tough
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: how'd that record turn out again?
<Midnight_Tempest> go Blue Jays!... wait... thats baseball
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They were in the Superbowl once, but were defeated by the Patriots.
<Yahooz> Im sorta on the Tebow wagon myself
<LunaTheBeloved> ^
<Pony_of_War> Tebow is good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It wasn't bad this year.
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: I remember that. Twas a sad day.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<LunaTheBeloved> I liked Tebow even when he was in Florida
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01New team makes the superbowl.
<Pony_of_War> I started being interested in Football this year, before I didn't care
<RAWRity> I can't wait for Tebow to suck next year and thene everybody to complain about him.
<Pony_of_War> figures it was the last playoff game in the 4th quarter
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01What's the story of that game: Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01?
<Pony_of_War> (well, next to last)
<Yahooz> I sooooo wanted the 49-ers in the superbowl. The Giants did not deserve to win that game
<Midnight_Tempest> too much football... boo football
<Yahooz> That kick returner screwed EVERYTHING up
<Pony_of_War> But NY and Boston are rivals
<Yahooz> Not as much in football
<RAWRity> the ravens well and trully lost theirs. How do you fuck up a 26 YARD FIELD GOAL?

<otakon> "Are you kidding? I hate the furry little bastard, if I could I'd throw him in a sack. Throw the sack intoa river and hurl the river into a Black Hole! But I love filling out requisitions and this was a doozy..."
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Good movie.
<otakon> Airplane, GREAT MOVIE
<Phase4> Darf14: i'm sure its excelent, just not my kind of comedy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's actually Airplane!
<Yahooz> Airplane!!!!!!!
<otakon> oh yah
<Darf14> ok I understand

<Darf14> I concur
<Phase4> ^
<Yahooz> ohey pinkiepieswear
<Phase4> havent seen airplane, from that quote it looks funny
<Kencolt> Is it just me, or is the sound rather muted?
<Dashie_Dashie> It's just a flesh wound.
<Phase4> its rater muted
<otakon> Kencolt: SB is on a call
<Yahooz> Monty Python's Flying Circus > Holy Grail IMO

<KetaminaDianePie> still empty luckly
<otakon> eeyup

<otakon> in time for the stream to stall
<otakon> inb4 rage
<otakon> it's like breaking the speed limit
<KetaminaDianePie> what happend to SupeerBrony64?
<KetaminaDianePie> fk
<KetaminaDianePie> SuperBrony64
<otakon> he went to go answer a call
<otakon> and just getting to the red light first
<otakon> he's AFK
<otakon> I think Chrome must have froze again
<Dashie_Dashie> nope
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Sorry, phone ;____;
<otakon> Dashie_Dashie: then wat?
<otakon> that's oka
<Dashie_Dashie> the video still loaded after it was paused =o
<otakon> thought it might have been something serious
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Bit of a serious conversation right now...
<otakon> ah
<otakon> damn it
<Dashie_Dashie> We figured SB.
<Kencolt> Iguess it's working better... as far as incoming is going...
<Dashie_Dashie> anything that we could do to help?
<otakon> there goes ketamina
<otakon> and he's back
<KetaminaDianePie> back again.............
<Kencolt> Doubt I could be of any help. I suspect he doesn't have anyone he needs bitten.
<Dashie_Dashie> I return with applejuice
<otakon> wb
<otakon> hmmm
<otakon> he must still be on the phone
<Kencolt> I suspect he is.
<LadyHatapon> Then let us be patient.
<Kencolt> Okay. Question time. What is the single worst food you have ever eaten?
<KetaminaDianePie> cow's brain
<Dashie_Dashie> Meanwhile.. Pony OC
<Dashie_Dashie> http://tinypic.com/r/fcuv7k/5
<otakon> ummm
<otakon> has to be pickled herring
<otakon> yuck
<LadyHatapon> Cow tongue.
<otakon> it was sour and it CRUNCHED
<otakon> yet it was slimy too
<otakon> very nasty
<Dashie_Dashie> Sounds delicious.
<KetaminaDianePie> :P
<Kencolt> in my case, it was when I was in the Boy Scouts, and some self proclaimed idiot made for the troop shewy spahgetti. I donot mean al dente. I mean CHEWY.
<Kencolt> A properly prepared cow tongue is delish.
<otakon> yuck
<otakon> thought, I don't mind smoked neck
<otakon> or porigies!
<otakon> I LOVE porigies!
<Dashie_Dashie> 100x this ^
<Kencolt> Youmay have to get used to the texture-- but the flavor...
<otakon> it's TONGUE though
<otakon> as in, like the one in my mouth
<Kencolt> I like tripe-- if properly done. That said, it takes a while to do it properly.
<KetaminaDianePie> tha hell are porigies?
<otakon> hmmm
<otakon> a Porigie
<otakon> is a polish dumpling
<otakon> made with mashed potatoes and cheese as the filling
<Kencolt> otakon: If you kiss a girl (or boy) tongues are tasting tongues a lot anyhow? So what's the problem?
<KetaminaDianePie> whoaaa
<otakon> usually fry them up in light oil
<KetaminaDianePie> sounds delicious
<otakon> with some bacon and chopped onion
<otakon> and server with sour cream
<Dashie_Dashie> dat Fluttershy stare
<KetaminaDianePie> now im getting hungry......
<Saturn> 8,1what are your opinions on eating pets once they die?
<pony_2820> hi
<otakon> umm
<Dashie_Dashie> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXgFZgnivXs&feature=g-u-u&context=G204b2a8FUAAAAAAAHAA
<Saturn> 8,1i'm trying to settle an argument.
<otakon> are they fresh?
<Saturn> 8,1yup
<Saturn> 8,1perfectly edible
<otakon> were they healthy?
<Kencolt> If they died, it's not probably safe meat.
<otakon> yeah
<Saturn> 8,1we're assuming yes
<otakon> too risky
<otakon> if it died of natural causes
<KetaminaDianePie> well if it edible ill give it a try
<Kencolt> What did they die of? Is it possibly contagous? What are the local laws in your area? WHYTHE HELL ARE YOU EATING GERBIL? (not Guinea Pig-- that's different, Equador, they raise them there for eating. It's called Cuii.)
<otakon> umm
<otakon> you eat Guinea Pigs?
<otakon> WHY!?
<otakon> they are so cute and fuzzy
<Kencolt> Used to be delicacy for only the royalty. Nowadays, everyone can and does eat it.
<KetaminaDianePie> anyone has ever tried horse meat?
<otakon> O.O
<otakon> I haven't
<LadyHatapon> ....Not I.
<Kencolt> Yes, Otakon. they are cute, and fuzzy and YUMMY.
<otakon> but I hear you have to stew it
<KetaminaDianePie> nope
<otakon> because horseflesh is damn tough
<otakon> SuperBrony64: you okay man?
<LadyHatapon> N-not the guinea pigs
<KetaminaDianePie> you just use it like cows meat
<LadyHatapon> D:
<Kencolt> I have. In Mexico. Well flavore, but very very lean. Almost always used ground.
<otakon> what?
<otakon> Horse or Guinea Pig?
<Kencolt> That, or as has been noted, long stewed.
<otakon> Well
<Kencolt> Horse. I have yet to get to Equadorand try cuii.
<otakon> I've had gator before, just like beef really
<Kencolt> Also Burro. You eat what you can buy.
<otakon> in a chili dog, delicious
<Kencolt> Gator tastes NOTHING like beef. Closer to catfish IMHO.
<KetaminaDianePie> btw i dont like horse tht much..... but horse salame is good
<otakon> SuperBrony64: please say something man, getting worried
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hey, I'm back
<otakon> phew
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Sorry for worrying you all
<LadyHatapon> Everything alright, SuperBrony64?
<Kencolt> Is OK.
<otakon> indeed, you okay?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yeah I'm fine >_<
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Thanks for asking
<otakon> good to hear
<ScootalooWonderloo> hey there guys :3
<otakon> hiya ScootalooWonderloo
<Kencolt> I mean, IS OK he worried-- that's what Bronies are for. But indeed is YOU OK?
<KetaminaDianePie> SB!
<otakon> Kencolt: he said he's okay, if he wasn't he would say he wasn't
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I basically need to fight my school that a D- is enough of a grade to make a class count as a prerequisite.
<otakon> damn
<ScootalooWonderloo> THIS IS AMAZING
<Kencolt> Apparently not since he decided to assault us with this!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai KetaminaDianePie
<LadyHatapon> ...Oh dear...
<otakon> that sucks man
<SuperBrony64> 10,02They've been screwing me over since I first started
<otakon> well
<otakon> it is technically a passing grade correct?
<otakon> just below average IIRC
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Imagine half-way through the semester of a super hard course telling me that it's no longer a requirement.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02D- in their course catalog states 'Barely Passing'
<Kencolt> SB64: You're prolly going to lose. I had to take Calculus three times to get the needed C before it was accepted.
<ScootalooWonderloo> :OOOO <3 this song...kirbopher is a genus
<otakon> damn it that's not fair
<SuperBrony64> 10,02They've done so much to me that I should be arguing way more about what they did
<otakon> argh
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Changing requirements on me left and right
<otakon> whatever happened to student rights?
<otakon> your paying THEM
<otakon> not the other way around
<ScootalooWonderloo> raritys flank....should be feard by all ~.~
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Plus now our student government is passing a bill ON THEIR OWN BEHALF to be compensated financially for their work.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Real jerk move.
<otakon> damn it
<LadyHatapon> Dang. ;^;
<KetaminaDianePie> :O
<Kencolt> You're payingthem to be educated. And to make certain you are educated. I mean, I can see how it can be frustrating, but they do have a point.... and standards.
<otakon> US colleges piss me off
<otakon> what's the course SB?
<Kencolt> OK. The SGU is going beyond their perview.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Indeed they do, but I've worked hard getting great grades these semesters and because I got that grade in one class they are throwing their hands up in the air saying 'Too bad'
<otakon> wait
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Introduction to Materials
<otakon> they're busting your chops
<Midnight_Tempest> and i come back... to zelda ponies... AHHHHH!!!
<otakon> on one course?
<KetaminaDianePie> hey Midnight_Tempest!
<otakon> out of how many?
<Kencolt> SB, the silution is -- sadly-- simple. You retake the class and pass with the rightgrade. At the least you have a hoof up.
<ScootalooWonderloo> AYAAYAYAYAYAAAY
<KetaminaDianePie> never did this
<Midnight_Tempest> lolz
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Out of like at least 30-35 courses
<ScootalooWonderloo> <3 THIS VIDEO :3
<KetaminaDianePie> hey my ringtone!
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> bullshit
*Midnight_Tempest explodes, reforms, explodes again, reforms again then implodes
<otakon> one damn course
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It's the flaw of being a part of a new university that is offering a major in a relatively new industry.
<Kencolt> Been there, suffered though it-- it's not unusual.
<otakon> still bullshit
<ScootalooWonderloo> dat plot >.>
<Midnight_Tempest> o//o
<otakon> what the blazes....
<Kencolt> otakon, I can't agree. It's more that standards aren't always what you agree with.
<ScootalooWonderloo> she uses that think like a weapon..i swear :/
<Kencolt> Okay. This just got WRONG.
<Midnight_Tempest> its super effective
*Midnight_Tempest now has a nose bleed
<ScootalooWonderloo> > implications
<Dashie_Dashie> Sb, Play Fluttershys Lantment :3
*Midnight_Tempest actually does have a nose bleed, just started randomly
<otakon> Kencolt: so basically your saying it's fair that the make him retake it as a requirement despite doing well enough in the other courses? 1 out of 30 according to SB?
<ScootalooWonderloo> >.<
<Kencolt> The scary thing, is somewhere, somepony THOUGHT about this!
<ScootalooWonderloo> ONO
<SuperBrony64> 10,02"...Until it gets cut off and used as a half-mustache."
<otakon> oh lords
*ScootalooWonderloo facepalms
<LadyHatapon> Not this soooong ._.
<Midnight_Tempest> worst song EVAH
<otakon> damn you mesmerizing plot movement!
<Kencolt> otakon: Yes. If it's an essential course, yes. I had to do the same on my second degree.
<ScootalooWonderloo> fus ro yay :3
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm going to try something, but give me a few min. Stream will be down until then
<otakon> still sounds like pretentious college bull to me tbh
<pony_2781> hi
<LadyHatapon> Whatever you have to do SB64 ^_^
<otakon> but I'll take your word on it Kencolt
<ScootalooWonderloo> gives me time to check timblr
<KetaminaDianePie> GOGOGO SB!
<otakon> oh well
<ScootalooWonderloo> tumblr*
<otakon> I need a drink anyway
<Kencolt> Well, as I said,-- I have TWO baccalaureates. Experience. Some courses are more... critical than others. And they do make the rules...
<otakon> Yeah
<otakon> after they take your money
<Midnight_Tempest> i iz a smrat ponie lulz...
<otakon> I wonder how much MORE it's gonna cost him to retake that course?
<Midnight_Tempest> BOOMheadshot
<otakon> oh, a couple of grand mayhaps?
<Midnight_Tempest> probably
<otakon> oh well, that's just another year or two in debt after college
<Midnight_Tempest> its gonna take probably that much just for me to do my IT courses in september
<Kencolt> the important thing is PASSING the course.
<otakon> what the hell is the point of the collegiate system in the US nowadays? It's not like it can guarantee you a job now and it can leave you in years worth of debt.
<otakon> Actually glad I didn't go to college when it was suggested I should tbh.
<Kencolt> There are no guarantees ever of anything. I studied to be a journalist... and sadly, graduated just after the newspapaer market was saturated by a pack of loons.
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> well that's why most people go to college
<otakon> not for the sake of learning
<otakon> for the improvement of their chances in the job market
<Kencolt> Then I took a second degree in computer sciene-- and just after I graduated all the tech exploded, so all mu studies of CoBOL and Machine Language was rendered useless by the PC revolution.
<otakon> Have you ever heard of the old bit "If you don't go to college, you'll end up flipping burgers the rest of your life". Well, the burger flippers became owners and managers while the college goers are in debt and looking for gainful employment.
<Kencolt> I live on a trust fund-- and oddly happily. But I do miss the possible opportunity that I might have had had I graduated at the right time...
<KetaminaDianePie> cobol and machine language?
<otakon> hmmm, well that sucks in your timing it seems.
<Kencolt> I take it you're not familiar with those terms?
<otakon> Eh, I'm just being cynical about my own situation I should stop.
<KetaminaDianePie> im just wondering HOW OLD ARE YOU?
<KetaminaDianePie> my dad studied the same thingsa
<Kencolt> COBOL: Common Business Oriented Language. Oh- 54 last November.
<otakon> That's what I've been wondering too. But he didn't say.
<otakon> wat?!
<Kencolt> Yes. Mucho older brony.
<otakon> woah
<KetaminaDianePie> :D!
<otakon> and here I thought I was one of the older members here.
<KetaminaDianePie> my dad is 55
<Midnight_Tempest> 54? wow... thats like 2 of me
<otakon> good lord, your twice my age Kencolt
<LadyHatapon> ...54?
<Kencolt> I've never made a secret of it. I have an artificial hip-- broke it a few months back. Eyes suck, and my teeth aren't much better.
<LadyHatapon> o___o
<otakon> Well sir, I apoligize for my rude comments earlier.
<Saturn> 8,1who's the oldest here?
<otakon> Kencolt Saturn
<Saturn> 8,1i'm 24, i know otakon's 27
<Midnight_Tempest> im 27 too
<Saturn> 8,1how old?
<Kencolt> So you whippersnapper-- be wary! You have a bucking ELDER here!
<Kencolt> Like I said-- I speak from experience.
<otakon> 54
<Saturn> 8,1what?
<Midnight_Tempest> lol whippersnappers
<Saturn> 8,1seriously?
<otakon> he's 54
<Saturn> 8,1that's awesome!
<otakon> indeed
<Kencolt> How often do I have to say it?
<otakon> alright, I shall pay heed form now on.
<Midnight_Tempest> i love it when there are bronies that old, they have the best sense of humour on the planet
<otakon> damn, I have been surprised by this place yet AGAIN
<Saturn> 8,1Kencolt: sorry, i'm not good at context at this time of morning
<otakon> I thought Wrek was older
<Midnight_Tempest> morning?
<Saturn> 8,1but yeah, that's awesome
<otakon> he's 17
<Saturn> 8,1a real COBOL guy too
<otakon> I thought ScootaChicken was older
<Kencolt> November 13, 1957. I grew up during Vietnam and the Hippies. (who were mostly idiots.) I remember riots when Martin Luther King got shot, and watche the Moon Landing on w 12 inch B&W TV.
<otakon> he's 14
<LadyHatapon> Daaaaang.
<Midnight_Tempest> :D idiot hippies
<otakon> damn man, you live through it!
<otakon> actually
<Kencolt> And yes-- I votyed for reagan. Both times. The man may not have been everyone's cup of tea, but he did do womthing that no other president did...
<Midnight_Tempest> Scorpio's rule! November 7th for me
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Awww...I'm missing a certain cable to make it perfect...
<otakon> your as old as my dad
<SuperBrony64> 10,02BUT
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I will try and do what I'm about to do
<Kencolt> When he said he was goling to do something-- he DID it.
<Midnight_Tempest> you failed me for the last time SuperBrony64!!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:<
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It won't be perfect...
<KetaminaDianePie> ooooooowww
<Midnight_Tempest> now say what i said in Megatrons voice :D
<otakon> well, give it a shot
<KetaminaDianePie> GOGOGO!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Until I get the cable tomorrow
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Won't be able to talk while I do this though
<Midnight_Tempest> you better SB... Im watching you >____O
<Kencolt> So, otalon- I have some... small reason... to suggest that I have some idea of which I speak. :)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Here we go...
<otakon> orlly?
<LadyCanary> Go on ahead SB~
<otakon> what?
<otakon> oh
<otakon> OH!
<Midnight_Tempest> do eeeet SB
<otakon> I read that wrong the first time. Yeah, I elieve you now
<otakon> believe
<Kencolt> Actually, I lucked out during the MLK debacle-- I was in a small ht in Soutyh Carolina when it happened, we were on vacation, far from an urban center.
<otakon> Dear Princess Celestia, I learned to listen to my elders today. They got to be elders for a reason. Your faithful student, otakon
<otakon> I would say
<Midnight_Tempest> MLK... that sounds familiar...
<Kencolt> I believe the term is LOL.
*LadyCanary giggles.
<Kencolt> MArtin Luther King.
<otakon> Martin Luther King Jr. Midnight_Tempest
<otakon> yesh
<Midnight_Tempest> ok, thought so
<Saturn> 8,1Kencolt: what do you think of functional programming?
<Kencolt> I was in my early teens and the only thing I could think was "Oh, crap."
<otakon> yeah, that covers it.
<Midnight_Tempest> i would've thought the same thing
<Kencolt> My studies are sadly out of date. But assuming the term means what it implies, it sounds like a sensible thing.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02going live!
<Saturn> 8,1scheme, ml, haskell sort of thing
<LadyCanary> Yaaaay
<Kencolt> I'm a WASP 54 year old male. What ELSE wouldI have thought at that-- or any- time?
<Midnight_Tempest> AHHHHH!!!
*Saturn 8,1is becoming more of a functional junkie every day
<otakon> dat 3DS
<KetaminaDianePie> 3ds.................
<LadyCanary> Mario Kart! :D
<Kencolt> Again-- my studies ended with COBOL and Basic and some C+. Those I don't know about.
<ScootalooWonderloo> suddenly loud noises
<Midnight_Tempest> mario kart 7... i am disappoint...
<KetaminaDianePie> we can hear you breathe SB :)
<otakon> damn it's loud
<LadyCanary> Aw come on, Mario Kart 7 was great, Midnight_Tempest.
<Midnight_Tempest> that is some good sound capturing though, damn
<otakon> well, now I REALLY feel like a dullard around here.
<Kencolt> Ok, reload screen-- and it's stopping-- now starting, now... what?
<otakon> hmmm
<otakon> Kencolt: you might want to check your connection speed
<Midnight_Tempest> i havent played a mario game since the 64 LadyCanary... i havent had fun with mario kart since the SNES though
<LadyCanary> Ah.
<Kencolt> The usual 100 MBPS.
<Midnight_Tempest> dat buffering...
<Saturn> 8,1Kencolt: i was surprised to read the other day that COBOL is still in use in the big enterprises
<otakon> http://www.speedtest.net/
<otakon> well, run this anyway
<otakon> if it's that fast
<otakon> you shouldn't be experiencing starts and stops
<Kencolt> Oh-- it's got two advantages, really. One is that COBOL is PERFECT for accounting... it was designed for that. the other is it's self-documenting-- even a Vice President can learn to understand the basic idea of a program.
<otakon> lol
<otakon> damn
<otakon> You don't have much faith in the intelligence of the average Vice do you?
<Midnight_Tempest> well... i dl at about 6 MBPS... that sucks
<otakon> eyah
<otakon> your lucky
<Midnight_Tempest> lolwut?
<otakon> I only get 2 Mbps tops
<Midnight_Tempest> wow
<Saturn> 8,1bugger, hs'e gone
<Saturn> 8,1i really want to meet him irl now
<Saturn> 8,1he sounds aweosme
<KetaminaDianePie> 3.35 Mbps :(
<Midnight_Tempest> same Saturn
<otakon> hell, me too
*LadyCanary nods
<Midnight_Tempest> yay! i have highest speed so far
<otakon> he must have been dc'd
<Saturn> 8,1i might add COBOL to my learn list after Scala
<Saturn> 8,1looking into it, it's actually quite a nice language
<otakon> wow though, I can't believe that there are fans out there that old
<LadyCanary> I know! What a shocker.
<otakon> I think that really does say something about the show
<otakon> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1728986505.png
<otakon> there, my results
<otakon> at least my ping is low
<SuperBrony64> 10,02????
<otakon> what's up SB?
<Midnight_Tempest> the show is the perfect way of bringing the world together... i will now make a blimp that will transmit the show to every TV in the world
<otakon> don't forget every language
<Midnight_Tempest> you know... my upload speed is horrendous
<SuperBrony64> 10,02How was the stream?
<Midnight_Tempest> choppy
<KetaminaDianePie> audio out of synch...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Really? :<
<Saturn> 8,1i might submit a coursework assignment next semester in COBOL
<otakon> yeah, not just me for once
<Midnight_Tempest> my stream keeps on buffering
<LadyCanary> Yep.
<Midnight_Tempest> http://www.speedtest.net/result/1728986218.png
<otakon> it was choppy Sb and the audio was WAY out of sync I'm afraid
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Lemme drop quality and see what happens
<otakon> needs more fiddling
*Phase4|OnTheRoof is now off the roof
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Alright, going to try again
<Phase4> hello again
<otakon> hi agian Phase4
<KetaminaDianePie> GOGOGO!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Please keep me updated if something happens >_<
<Phase4> Saturn: cobol? thats still in use?
<otakon> Phase4: guess how old KenColt is?
<Phase4> 12?
<otakon> 54
<Phase4> wow
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> scroll up the chat a bit
<Phase4> it was either realy young or old, picked the wrong one
<otakon> lol
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I see you figured out who was about double your age
<otakon> yeah, you had a fifty fifty chance I guess along that line of though
<otakon> SuperBrony64: he IS double my age
<LadyCanary> Well. Im off to bed now. I've had a long bittersweet day. Goodnight all! Have a great day/night all <3
<Phase4> your 27?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yup, like I said before :P
<Phase4> night LadyCanary
<otakon> night LadyCanary sleep well.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Except didn't want to give a name...
<otakon> eeyup Phase4, why?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Anyway Night LadyCanary!
<Phase4> just wondering
*SuperBrony64 hugs LadyCanary
<otakon> SuperBrony64: I can understand that.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Let's try this again
*Phase4 is 18
*LadyCanary hugs everyone on #bronystate. Enjoy the stream!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02UPDATE ME ON PROGRESS
<LadyCanary> <3
<otakon> hell, one of the newbies that come in earlier is 10!
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: working
<otakon> ummm, it was FluttershyOHYEAH11
<otakon> eeyup
<Midnight_Tempest> o.o whoa... thats a good speed... http://www.speedtest.net/result/1728994151.png
<Saturn> 8,1hey sb, let's see your pretty face
<otakon> he won't show us
<Saturn> 8,1aw :(
<Phase4> stream died here
<otakon> we got buffer rings
<Saturn> 8,1come on, sb, we wanna see you
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> audio is still about 10 seconds out of sync
<Midnight_Tempest> my speed went up after i stopped dling Doctor Who :D
<otakon> hmm, maybe more
<Midnight_Tempest> damn you BUFFERING!!
<Saturn> 8,1it pauses a lot to buffer for me, but i think that might be my connection
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: ofc, when you run more than one thing it eats up your bandwidth
<otakon> Saturn: me too, it's on SB's end
<Phase4> btw, about the roof i keep going on. my 'workplace' is a catering company and the factory is in a building within a warehouse, buildingception if you will. i;m running tempreture sensors to 4 fridges, 1 freezer, 2 blast chillers and a room
<Saturn> 8,1ah, okay
<Midnight_Tempest> i noticed... my speed doubled after turning off my torrent otakon
<TrixieMuffin> morning everypony
<otakon> wb TrixieMuffin
<Midnight_Tempest> mmm... muffin...
*Phase4 has no training in the work he is doing, but is getting no pay so it evens out
<Saturn> 8,1hey sb, let's see your pretty faceu streaming at?
<Dashie_Dashie> Morning TrixieMuffin
<Phase4> ohai TrixieMuffin
<Saturn> 8,1also, make sure your cpu and ram utilisation are in check
<otakon> Phase4: so if they complain, buck em you don't pay me?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Mah face?
<otakon> Saturn: how I do that?
<Saturn> 8,1oh also, tell FME to drop frames if it's struggling
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Alright
<otakon> OH!
<otakon> your talking to SB
<Saturn> 8,1aye
<Phase4> otakon: meh, i enjoy the work and its more or less my project. they want real time monitoring and logging, so i;m giving them that
*otakon faceplams
<Kencolt> The results were... inconsistent.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But you want to see my face?!
<Dashie_Dashie> wait wait wait
<Dashie_Dashie> my stream is buffering
<otakon> Kencolt: wb
<Midnight_Tempest> show me your mugshot SB
<SuperBrony64> 10,02No ;____;
<Dashie_Dashie> gimmeh a sec D:
<otakon> how so Kencolt?
<Midnight_Tempest> go it SB... or I'll stalk you for realz
<Phase4> 59 people, thats a little low
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Cause then it'll ruin your mental image of me of being a tall, dark, and handsome young colt.
<Saturn> 8,1my dog keeps farting in his sleep
<otakon> lol
<Phase4> Saturn: whut?
<otakon> I hate it when they do that
<Kencolt> Well, I tried Pingtest... first time, an F-- second time an A.
<KetaminaDianePie> ahahahaha
<Saturn> 8,1SuperBrony64: my mental image of you is of a short, ginger, leprechaun
<otakon> Kencolt: hmmm
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hahaha
<Midnight_Tempest> uh... your desktop pic already ruined that image SuperBrony64
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: he followed my into my bedroom, and decided to sleep on the floor
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O U
<otakon> what about speedtest Kencolt?
<Saturn> 8,1i can't shift him
<Kencolt> SB64: No fears. I never had that image.
<Phase4> so its a big dog
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Alright, 5 seconds is all you get
<Saturn> 8,1and now he's asleep and he won't stop farting and my room stinks now
<Kencolt> Oh, that was national a B and local an A- consistently.
<Dashie_Dashie> dat stream is still buffering for me ;^;
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: very big
<Saturn> 8,1very very big
<KetaminaDianePie> wait stream is down!
<Saturn> 8,1he doesn't need to stand on anything or jump to nick food off the table
<Saturn> 8,1put it that way
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Be sure to have you eyes on the stream
<Kencolt> I could not have guessed, KDP.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Going live in 5 seconds
<Midnight_Tempest> O_____O
*Phase4 opens wireshark in hopes of recording this
<otakon> Kencolt: no, I meant the actual numbers you got, click the share button on the results
<KetaminaDianePie> O_O
<otakon> and post the link
<Kencolt> Oh, again? I don't really fell like it at the moment-- usually, things work OK, I'm not woried.
<otakon> I see nothing but buffer circle: the revenge
<otakon> eh, no worries
<Phase4> everyday i'm buffering
<Kencolt> Everpinnning in the blue. m Or rather black.
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> same here
<Midnight_Tempest> longest 5 seconds ever
<otakon> he lied
<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol
<Midnight_Tempest> he's a cake?!
<Dashie_Dashie> SB IS THE GREATEST TROLL EVAR.
<otakon> eeyup
<Kencolt> Of coursem when it IS online, what we get is watching games, which doesn't excite me...
<SuperBrony64> 10,0210 seconds
<KetaminaDianePie> SB wont deliver......
<Kencolt> Ah-- b ut WHICH 10? He's not telling us THAT!
<Midnight_Tempest> lol, innuendo
<otakon> Kencolt: what does then?
<otakon> lol
<Phase4> dat music
<Phase4> xD
<Saturn> 8,1hahaha
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:P
<Saturn> 8,1<3
<KetaminaDianePie> HEY THERE :D!
<Kencolt> GAH!
<Midnight_Tempest> screen CAPTURED!!
<Saturn> 8,1i'd tap that.
<otakon> ahahaha!
<Kencolt> I'd SHOOT it! What is THAT?
<otakon> Saturn: you'd tap ANYTHING you loony scot!
<otakon> Kencolt: that was SuperBrony64
<Dashie_Dashie> everyday i'm buffering..
*Phase4 kinda got a recording, just in case
<Saturn> 8,1SuperBrony64: actually, you do have really nice eyes
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Thanks ^_^
*Midnight_Tempest throws a pokeball at the screen 'SuperBrony64... get inside that... nao...'
<SuperBrony64> 10,02They match my Mod colors O___O
<Phase4> very dark eyebrows
<otakon> :D
<Saturn> 8,1indeed
<Kencolt> They freaking GLOW. And I have spinning lag circle again.
<otakon> Kencolt: your reaction, was PRICELESS
<otakon> I'd SHOOT it! What is THAT?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02:P
<Dashie_Dashie> I take it you all can see the stream? -_-
<otakon> it's buffering again
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So, how did I look?
<Midnight_Tempest> lol yup... screencapture worked
<otakon> umm, surprised tobh
<otakon> tbh
<KetaminaDianePie> just as i imagined you
<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol
<Kencolt> I see no stream. I see a face... a strange face... and a circle of lag.
<Phase4> hmmm, i'ma try something. brb
<Midnight_Tempest> you look... human... WHERE IS DA PONY!!
<otakon> it's not a cirlce of lag
<Kencolt> Buffering caounts as lag.
<otakon> it's RETURN OF THE BUFFER 2: THE BUFFERING
<Kencolt> Whatever. the point is IT'S THERE.
<Saturn> 8,1i heard a terrible joke today
<Midnight_Tempest> yay! jokes!
<otakon> yeah, he's setting it back up it seems
<Saturn> 8,1three old biddies were sitting on a park bench, when a naked stripper walked past
<Saturn> 8,1one of them has a stroke, but the other two couldn't reath
<Saturn> 8,1*rech
<Saturn> 8,1*reach
<otakon> ......
<Kencolt> I had a joke that would only make sense to anyone who played Final Fantasy 11 Online-- but damn, the players there loved it.
<otakon> okay, shoot
*Saturn 8,1shoots
<Midnight_Tempest> oh god... so wrong Saturn... I love it :D
<PartyCannon> hey there VioletVanilla
<Saturn> 8,1SuperBrony64: i've got one you'll like
<Midnight_Tempest> dat vivi
<otakon> hello VioletVanilla
*otakon hugs VioletVanilla
<VioletVanilla> 08,14>< hallo. . .
*VioletVanilla hugs everypony
<Saturn> 8,1what's black and white and causes a relativistic non simultaneity paradox?
<Kencolt> welcome to "Where's and what is the stream?" With your host, SB64, the Man without a Cable.
<Saturn> 8,1a nun with a javelin through he back running through a barn at near C
<otakon> lol
<Kencolt> Anchovies, Saturn. What else?
<Midnight_Tempest> gah... math joke...
<otakon> I dont' get it Saturn
<otakon> but Kencolts' comment is lol worthy
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Glad you all liked my face on stream >_<
<Midnight_Tempest> i got a joke, or more of a limrick...
<otakon> is it a dirty limrick?
<Saturn> 8,1otakon: it's a modification of "what's black and white and doesn't fit through doorways" but with the barn door relativistic thought experiment
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Time for YouTube
<Midnight_Tempest> yes otakon
<Kencolt> I seem to have... disturbed... someponies here tonight when they realised my... age.
<otakon> Kencolt: no disturbing, just wowing really
<KetaminaDianePie> SB you are getting lazy lately.........
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Lazy?! D:
<PartyCannon> lol
<Saturn> 8,1Kencolt: disturbed? morelike turbed.
<otakon> tb utterly honest, surprised.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Why? ;____;
<KetaminaDianePie> you stream less videogame and more youtube
<otakon> dat Braeburn
<Kencolt> I can't really relate to your surprise. Why shouldn't a 54 year old southyern male be a brony?
<Dashie_Dashie> SB SB SB SB SB SB
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai!
<Saturn> 8,1dat braeburn
<Saturn> 8,1<3
<Dashie_Dashie> Fluttershys Lantment :3
<Dashie_Dashie> do ettttt
<Saturn> 8,1braeburn x macintosh is sexiest ship
<otakon> Kencolt: well, I said earlier the show MUST have something going for it.
<Midnight_Tempest> ok, so a man goes out to the bar to drink but only finds one bar near his home. not wanting to travel to get drinks he enters and finds that it is a gay bar. not really caring he walks up to the bar and sits, then asks the bartender for a drink.
<otakon> oh boy
<Phase4> i'm back, didnt work
<Phase4> it didnt work'
<otakon> oh well
<Phase4> i worked
<Kencolt> you might want to repeat your letter for Vivi-- it was something of a hoot. ^_^
<KetaminaDianePie> :O?
<Phase4> suddenly this image again
<KetaminaDianePie> i
<Kencolt> That is a disturbing pony image. Not sure why-- maybe it's the navel.
<otakon> oh god
<Phase4> dear god this song
<otakon> not this one
<KetaminaDianePie> wut is this?
<PartyCannon> Let's Get Creative!
*Phase4 *mute*
<otakon> Kencolt: it's the humanization of it I think a bit
<Phase4> ding me when the song is over
<otakon> I don't know
<otakon> I muted it too
<Kencolt> It's the navel. It's SOO much the navel.
<otakon> I want to sleep sometime today
<Anthony> hello i am new here im a brony and someone recommended i come here
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai Anthony! Welcome ^_^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Now I am done with Saints Row 3.
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Halol Anthony
<Kencolt> Ponies are NOT naturally outies.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You watching our stream Anthony?
<otakon> it's a ring
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Welcome to BronyState Anthony.
<Midnight_Tempest> the bartender walks over and says 'i'll only sell you drinks if you tell me the name of your penis.' the man seems confused but is thirsty so he turns to the man on his left and asks what his penis' name is, then the man on his right. after some time the man calls for the bartender again. 'So, what's its name then?' the man looks at the bartender and says 'Its name is Secret, strong enough for a man but made for a woman'
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Kencolt. . . leteter? i am mial pony
<Kencolt> A... Okay. That's even MORE off.
<Anthony> no on my screen it just a grey block
<Phase4> Anthony: what browser are you running?
<Kencolt> 'otakon, what was that letter again?
<Anthony> internet explorer
<otakon> hold on
<otakon> I can't seem to find it
<Kencolt> Because it did flatter me somewhat.
<Phase4> well theres your problem
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Are you at http://www.bronystate.net?
<Anthony> yes
<Midnight_Tempest> aww... well... guess i wont tell a joke like that again... T_T
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You could pastebin it.
<Phase4> Anthony: ie6 wont run the site, you can install chrome frame and whitelist this site if you realy want to use ie, but i would REALY recomend installing another browser
<otakon> Dear Princess Celestia, I learned to listen to my elders today. They got to be elders for a reason. Your faithful student, otakon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Instead of posting a wall of text.
<Phase4> firefox and chrome are good
<Anthony> i will try mozilla and see if it works
<KetaminaDianePie> o_o

<HeavyMetalDash> neat-o
<Baka-Neku> *proud*
<Dashie_Dashie> Just finished reading My Little Dashie.
*HeavyMetalDash pats Baka-Neku on the back
<Dashie_Dashie> many tears were shed
<Dashie_Dashie> ;_;
<HeavyMetalDash> IKR
<Baka-Neku> i cried of happiness D:
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm happy crying right now
<Dashie_Dashie> oh god I'm bawing
<HeavyMetalDash> so much joys
<KetaminaDianePie> :(
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm a grown brony.
<Dashie_Dashie> a big guy, and i'm bawing like a baby.
<Baka-Neku> You OK Rainbow Dash? Anything i can do to HALP?
<KetaminaDianePie> i fell asleep 40 min before the episode
<KetaminaDianePie> :(
<Baka-Neku> poor thing
<HeavyMetalDash> darn that story!
<BewareOfRabbit> i have somthing that will change your lives forever
<BewareOfRabbit> ready to hear it
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm defintely bookmarking that, and I'll read all the time.
<HeavyMetalDash> sure
<BewareOfRabbit> blah
<BewareOfRabbit> its the password of life
<HeavyMetalDash> I have one of those
<BewareOfRabbit> Blue Light And houses
<BewareOfRabbit> Blah
<BewareOfRabbit> no one likes poor spike =(
<HeavyMetalDash> I don't
<HeavyMetalDash> I luvz da little guy
<BewareOfRabbit> awwwww
<BewareOfRabbit> your the odd one out
<Dashie_Dashie> I lost it when he was reading the album where Dashie left him the note.
<BewareOfRabbit> everyone else doesnt =(
<jingles> I like Spike! he's the only character from the original :D
<BewareOfRabbit> well technicly they are all from the originals
<HeavyMetalDash> Pretty sure thts not true
<jingles> Rarity's based on Majesty, but other than that, nope
<BewareOfRabbit> pinkie pie has the coat and mane of a G3 pegasus
<BewareOfRabbit> and name
<BewareOfRabbit> or somthing
<BewareOfRabbit> ect
<jingles> Those are NOT the originals XD
<BewareOfRabbit> well
<BewareOfRabbit> the not originals
<BewareOfRabbit> dont make me cry :'(
<jingles> I was sad that they renamed Wisteria from HER G3 pony
<BewareOfRabbit> now that derpy has talked dr hooves needs to be the new wheres pony
<jingles> You now know her as Cherilee, the schoolteacher...
<jingles> Yeah, I found this site watching you guys TOTALLY LOSE YOUR HEADS when Derpy was named
<HeavyMetalDash> good times
<KetaminaDianePie> :((((((((((((((((
<BewareOfRabbit> i will miss derpy being the wheres waldo
<BewareOfRabbit> dr hooves needs to fill derpys shoes
<BewareOfRabbit> horse shoes
<HeavyMetalDash> I think she'll still be the where's waldo
<jingles> fanservice lives
<BewareOfRabbit> once you talk you will never be the same
<BewareOfRabbit> i hope lauren faust makes dr hooves appear in a flash of light or somthing in a hidden spot
<BewareOfRabbit> and dissapear a few secs after
<jingles> nah, if they meant to make a habit of it, they'd've picked some lucky punk to voice hir
<BewareOfRabbit> tabitha
<HeavyMetalDash> puh-lease this show has a nack for disregarding the predetermined lines
<jingles> and, uh, since nobody seems sure if Derpy is male or female...
<BewareOfRabbit> shes female
<BewareOfRabbit> stallions almost always have a head like a hair dryer
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<jingles> OMFG way to totally stereotype
<jingles> maybe, since she... or he... sounded a little yellow bus special
<HeavyMetalDash> She
<jingles> he just finds it easier to let his gorgeous mane flow free >.>'
<HeavyMetalDash> she
<BewareOfRabbit> im kinda upset how they made derpy abit to derped
<HeavyMetalDash> stop disregarding the S
<BewareOfRabbit> when she spoke
<Dashie_Dashie> Derpy has female eye lashes, so therefore it's a she. :>
<Dashie_Dashie> Pony logic.
<BewareOfRabbit> plus her head does not look like a hairdryer
<HeavyMetalDash> is best logic
<jingles> I'm not disregarding it, I'm referring to the possibility that it could be male. Though... mostly teasingly, because yes, boyponies always have really distinct characteristics.
<BewareOfRabbit> yeh a headryer
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<jingles> In fact, if you go by the ponies you can buy...there's like two boys for a hundred girls
<Dashie_Dashie> I might have to do a youtube reading for My little Dashie, seeing as some people are annoying commentators.
<jingles> pretty much how a real horse herd works, so
<HeavyMetalDash> do eet
<BewareOfRabbit> hold on just abit of question here?
<HeavyMetalDash> hmm?
<BewareOfRabbit> why are there millions of female ponys
<BewareOfRabbit> but few and far males
<HeavyMetalDash> because science
<jingles> because it was a franchise directed at, and for, girls
<Dashie_Dashie> Big Mac get's all the flank.
<jingles> almost EXCLUSIVELY until this recent brony crazy
<BewareOfRabbit> lol
<jingles> craze
<BewareOfRabbit> eeeeeyup
<BewareOfRabbit> all the girls be loving big mac
<Dashie_Dashie> especially Molestia.
<jingles> Anyone else weirded out by Rarity being.... late teens to 20s? ish? flirting with and manipulating Spike, a baby dragon who's just turned a year old?
<BewareOfRabbit> XD
<Dashie_Dashie> OH DEAR GOD.
<HeavyMetalDash> inter-species
<BewareOfRabbit> jingles
<BewareOfRabbit> dragons age slower than ponies
<jingles> not what that long, agile tongue is foooor (I saw what he did with that cupcake)
<jingles> so it's even worse!
<Dashie_Dashie> Not to mention Spike can INSTA-GROW.
<jingles> That's not mental state
<HeavyMetalDash> Spike's been with twi since she was just a filly so he's probably not tht much younger
<jingles> we saw, if anything, his mental state deteriorates
<BewareOfRabbit> yeh
<HeavyMetalDash> and more often than not he can be the more adult of them all
<BewareOfRabbit> hey has anyone seen how in his daydreams he was always a bipedal civilized dragon guy type thing
<jingles> also, i apologize in advance should my typing deteriorate.. ambien makes you hallucinate just a little bit
<Dashie_Dashie> oh god..
<jingles> With big muscles and a sword?
<BewareOfRabbit> but when puberty becomes a bitch for him hes a monster
<Dashie_Dashie> everytime I see rainbow dash now I get teary eye'd
<Dashie_Dashie> ;_;
<BewareOfRabbit> maybe dragons turn different according to mental states
<HeavyMetalDash> IKR
<BewareOfRabbit> if they dont become greedy
<jingles> i totally knew as soon as he started collecting... "DRAGONHOARD!"
<BewareOfRabbit> they grow up bipedal and civilized
<BewareOfRabbit> grow up greedy
<BewareOfRabbit> monstaaaah
<jingles> Maybe, who knows...
*IshBestPony curls up, sleeps and looks cuddly and huggable
<Dashie_Dashie> Donald Trump is now Spike.
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<jingles> The dragon Fluttershy scolded seemed speechless, but intelligent
<BewareOfRabbit> -huggeth thy pony-
<jingles> nuuu spike is cute and deserves cuddles
*Dashie_Dashie hugs ishy
<jingles> trump only needs a thirty thousand volt cattle prod to the taint
<HeavyMetalDash> I sence a disturbance....
<Dashie_Dashie> in the farce?
*HeavyMetalDash hugs Ish
<BewareOfRabbit> id rather be a bipedal civilized dragon if i was in the mlp universe
<jingles> ...i'd rather be a pony
<BewareOfRabbit> if i was a dragon
<HeavyMetalDash> I'd rather be a party Streamer
<HeavyMetalDash> ...someday
<BewareOfRabbit> id be a zapapple tree
<jingles> or pinkie's party cannon <3
<IshBestPony> bai everypony
<HeavyMetalDash> nuuuu...kbai

<HeavyMetalDash> <3
<BewareOfRabbit> moar pegacorns
<BewareOfRabbit> moaaaaaarrrr
<HeavyMetalDash> Alicorn
<jingles> Those are only the two actual princesses, supposedly
<BewareOfRabbit> alicorn
<HeavyMetalDash> correct terminoligy
<jingles> according to who, terry brooks? XD
<Dashie_Dashie> looks like another Ajax episode this saturday.
<Dashie_Dashie> .__.
<HeavyMetalDash> the dictionary of mythical creatures vol.6
<BewareOfRabbit> alicorns ftw
<jingles> does it say anything about the phi kasue?
<BewareOfRabbit> tho in babycakes the unicorn could fly through magic.....
<BewareOfRabbit> unicorn ftw
<jingles> they're vampires, but they don't suck blood
<HeavyMetalDash> sounds unhealthy
<BewareOfRabbit> lol jingles u reminded me of twilight
<jingles> they shove their tongue up your ass in their sleep and SLURP OUT YOUR FECES
<HeavyMetalDash> do they drink the color red?
<BewareOfRabbit> lets me vege vampires
<jingles> so... you know, JUST like Twilight
<BewareOfRabbit> hey heavy
<HeavyMetalDash> yea?
<BewareOfRabbit> theres a game called the void where these women drink colour
<HeavyMetalDash> lol awesome
<BewareOfRabbit> search it up and love it
<BewareOfRabbit> its an epic game
<jingles> i've played that game, but it wasn't on the psp... it was on the lsd
<HeavyMetalDash> I wan't to drink the color green
<jingles> it tastes like licorice
<BewareOfRabbit> theres nerva and somthing else
<BewareOfRabbit> in the void
<BewareOfRabbit> that game you have no clue
<BewareOfRabbit> what your doing
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<BewareOfRabbit> and everything makes you go what the everfree forest
<Dashie_Dashie> Lol if I was still in high school...
<jingles> damn, do those still exist?
<Dashie_Dashie> Show MLD in english, make everyone BAWWW, get an easy A
<HeavyMetalDash> I would be best highschool brony
<jingles> i thought they'd gone right to prison camps these days
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm ok with this.
<Dashie_Dashie> Closet Brony no more.
<BewareOfRabbit> if someone starts livestreaming ask them to livestream the void
<HeavyMetalDash> I add elements of harmony to every periodic table now
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<jingles> but.. are they heavy metals? XD
<HeavyMetalDash> they are heaviest metals!
<jingles> I dunno
<HeavyMetalDash> they hold the most weight to me <3
<jingles> Pinkie's ... probably nitrous oxide -.-
<BewareOfRabbit> why dident i get a big crown thingy =(
<BewareOfRabbit> shes helium
<jingles> And Fluttershy would be something elusive and fluffy
<BewareOfRabbit> and nitrous oxide
<jingles> yeah, i think she's pretty much inspired by nitrous
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<jingles> she's even the color that it tastes like
<jingles> (synesthesia rocks)
<Dashie_Dashie> Rainbow dash is light hooved, but as hard as a rock
<Dashie_Dashie> what element would she be?
<jingles> i am painting pinkie pie
<jingles> it is not going well
<jingles> mercury duh
<BewareOfRabbit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_wZZ8SaLVU
<BewareOfRabbit> watch this if you wanna learn about the void
<jingles> HIGHLY POISONOUS too XD
<BewareOfRabbit> that game were people eat colours and you constantly go wtf
<HeavyMetalDash> makes sence
<jingles> Applejack'd probably be... carbon.
<jingles> Everywhere, basic, important, solid.
<HeavyMetalDash> dawwww very fitting
<jingles> Twilight Sparkle would be the rare earths and anything radioactive WITH MAGIC
<jingles> and Rarity's gold, silver, platinum... all the shiny things, oooooOOOooo
<HeavyMetalDash> lawl
<HeavyMetalDash> who is everyone's best pony?
<jingles> <---Pinkie hardcore
<KetaminaDianePie> Screw Ball
<jingles> And Fluttershy should be... idunno, something also light and fluffy and elusive.
<jingles> Argon?
<jingles> XD
<Dashie_Dashie> THIS PICTURE
<Dashie_Dashie> DAWWWWWWWWWWW
<Dashie_Dashie> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_z-PBmMmbwc/TxtZ81ygrqI/AAAAAAAAb5s/nC851eAtaaE/s1600/116088+-+artist+john_joseco+derpy_hooves+rainbow_dash.jpg
<HeavyMetalDash> lol
<jingles> So I can't manage to convince my mum that it's mostly guys who watch MLP
<BewareOfRabbit> is anyone watching the void
<Dashie_Dashie> Show her... bronycon.
<jingles> no, as i try to avoid chaos vents
<KetaminaDianePie> right
<jingles> ....that works to both, really
<HeavyMetalDash> whelp....I'm thinking that I either have to A work on my OC and watch MLP or B Play my guitar and watch MLP
<Dashie_Dashie> win/win
<Dashie_Dashie> either way
<jingles> i'm amazed there's a bronycon when the show's only been on a year xD
<HeavyMetalDash> IKR f'ing decisions
<Dashie_Dashie> Bronycon, less than 6 hours from where I live this year.
<jingles> where is it/
<Dashie_Dashie> TOTALLY GOING *squee*
<Dashie_Dashie> New york city
<jingles> i haven't driven six hours for a con since... uh. Otakon '05
<HeavyMetalDash> Y canada have no bronycon or even regular meetups?
<jingles> because lame canadiananans haven't arranged any?
<Dashie_Dashie> whar in canada dusk thou reside?
<HeavyMetalDash> I is feel secluded up here
<HeavyMetalDash> Manitoba
<jingles> soooo you have to worry about REAL Wendigo
<HeavyMetalDash> Wendigo in ancient indian lore was chopped into tiny bits and turned into misquitoes
<Dashie_Dashie> That's like a 14-16 hour drive for bronycon o.o
<Dashie_Dashie> *acquire plane tickets*
<jingles> yes, but a wendigo is created when a man's heart freezes and he turns into a cannibalistic monster.
<HeavyMetalDash> I can't no moar money to spend If I wanna make my anime convention perhaps next year...sigh
<jingles> furfest is turning into a mini ponythang
<Dashie_Dashie> I feel ya.. Jobless as of now, got laid off.
<jingles> which is kind of awesome
<Dashie_Dashie> sucks being 19. @_@
<jingles> someday, you'll look back at yourself and LAUGH for that statement
<HeavyMetalDash> indeed
<jingles> you might even laugh hard enough that you need a new colostomy bag
<Dashie_Dashie> Most likely.
<Dashie_Dashie> I'll read My little dashie when I'm 50 though.
<Dashie_Dashie> baw.
<Dashie_Dashie> die peacefully
<HeavyMetalDash> indeed
<jingles> why can i picture Pinkie as some kind of dr. kevorkian?
<HeavyMetalDash> I need a dash plushie to snuggle now
<jingles> feeding people special koolaid
<Dashie_Dashie> me to D:
<HeavyMetalDash> to the interent! wowthatwasfast

<Phase4> we must assume its posible, othewise we're stuck in this solar system forever
<RaveBrony> im sorry, what is FTL?
<Phase4> faster than light
<TrixieMuffin> *brohoof* i never understood why it wouldnt be possible anyway
<RaveBrony> AH
<RaveBrony> *Ah
<Phase4> wonder we're the up to with those ftl neutrino's, the news about them has kinda died out
<TrixieMuffin> the alternative , sublight spacetravel would either be a big ship with a viable ecosystem and self sustaining civilization on board
<ofna01> howdy everypony
<TrixieMuffin> or we just become immortal and ignore the time-aspect entirely
<ofna01> what

*RaveBrony brohoof :) (\
<ofna01> just watched one of my first MLP episodes
<Phase4> TrixieMuffin: to exceed that speed would, acording to relativity somehow, require infinite energy. you would need to ask a physics guy (cant spell the word) about why
<ofna01> it r epical
<RaveBrony> Which episode is that?
<ScootaChicken> have a brohoof ofna01 (\

<ScootaChicken> Spengbab
<Cypresswolf> I speculated over the weekend, givin that RD has shown she has a hard time keeping still, when she realizes she has to stay in that hospital bed, she'll try to make a run for it, winding up hiding in the library before getting caught. somepony sees her and gives her a book to read which she takes back to her room, having nothing else to do....she reads.
<Phase4> spongebob'

*Ictiv waits as canned cheer plays and dies off.
<LawnchairRawket> Got away Ictiv

<Ictiv> Got away?
<LawnchairRawket> Argh.
<LawnchairRawket> Damn this giant fingers of mine and this tiny keyboard.
<Ictiv> ..."fingers"?
<LawnchairRawket> These. THESE.
*Ictiv looks off towards but not into camera while canned laughter plays.
<Ictiv> I just realized I never saw "Married... With Children" in english. I'm afraid it may be one of those extremely few things where hungarian translation is actually better than original dub
<LawnchairRawket> Stop being silly there Ictiv.
<Ictiv> Any thoughts if I should look it up?
<Starflash> Back~ somewhat.
<Ictiv> Hey Sighi
<arrowtobroknee> hi people, what are we watching?
<Dken2021> oh thought the chat was silent for a reason....
<Starflash> Sighi?
<LawnchairRawket> I didn't even know Married With Children had a hungarian translation.
<Dken2021> ello arrowtobroknee
<arrowtobroknee> hi
<Ictiv> LawnchairRawket: If you'd kindly go to the SillyFilly room, you'd see I'm not just a Silly Filly but one of the rulers of SillyFillydelphia
<arrowtobroknee> is this the mummy?

*Cy` turns off stream and goes to listen to some more Beatles

<Ictiv> LawnchairRawket: You know what else Married with Children had in Hungary? A remake series... God do I want to slap those people
<Ictiv> Starflash: Me apparently
<Ictiv> But no worries :)
<Dken2021> as if that show was good in the first plce
<LawnchairRawket> Well. That's rather surprising there.
<Starflash> Ooo ok.
<Sumica> 00,10remake of an imported show..... that is silly
<Starflash> Dw Ictiv we still like you :3
<arrowtobroknee> they remade life on mars in the USA
<Dken2021> that show had more sexist joke than animes have fanservice
<Sumica> 00,10dosent make it less silly
<LawnchairRawket> Ruh roh.
<Ictiv> Sumica: A remake where they pretty much do the exact same thing, down the the plot of each episode with a diffrent set to shoot on
<LawnchairRawket> Things do not look good for our hero.
<Ictiv> If I heard 10 lines in the 6 episodes I was watching that wasn't straight from the original then I'm surprised
<arrowtobroknee> Fiish Him!#

<Yellowquiet> hi evrypony
<Ictiv> Hey Yellowquiet
<Dken2021> Ictiv must have a foreign keyboard
*Yellowquiet hugs everyone
<LawnchairRawket> God help you. Ha ha.

<Dken2021> lali-ho Yellowquiet
<Ictiv> Dken2021: I have a german keyboard, which types in Hungarian
<Ictiv> And I type english text with it
<Ictiv> It is also made in china... probably
<arrowtobroknee> everything is made in china
<Ictiv> *flips keyboard over* Yup, China
<Ictiv> arrowtobroknee: Untrue
<Ictiv> My Swiss Army knife was made in spain
<Ictiv> International economics FTW
<LawnchairRawket> Nice room.
<Sumica> 00,10it can push a ship through space and make booze, what a great ship drive system
<Ictiv> I'm wondering: Can "Odd Couple" be considered as a B (Given it is little known these days)
<Sumica> 00,10check IMDB
<Dken2021> the 1968 version?
<arrowtobroknee> oh god
<LawnchairRawket> Soo so be do.
<TrixieMuffin> Shoo bee doo
<Ictiv> Sumica: Okay, different question: What score is the big limit on A/B?
<Sumica> 00,10low score tends to be B movies as well as low budget
<LawnchairRawket> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7zJp-JeaKi4/TtnRCCmHcHI/AAAAAAAAWXg/qDqehUIHDpg/s1600/octo_octavia_by_shivanking-d4hvs6g.jpg Best seapony.
<Dken2021> I think I've seen this so much it doesn't even phase me anymore
<arrowtobroknee> dat applejack
<Ictiv> Sumica: I mean as in 6.5- is low? Or 7-?
<Yellowquiet> seaponies XD
<MirrorImage> arrowtobroknee: i believe that's supposed to be scootaloo in the background
<MirrorImage> Ictiv: it's a judgment call really
<LawnchairRawket> Octovia is best sea pon.
<MirrorImage> you can't use rating as an absolute indicator
<Yellowquiet> shu bi do
<MirrorImage> "good" - A; "meh" - A/B to be debated if/when it gets picked. "bad" - B
<Ictiv> MirrorImage: I know, but Sumica told me to check IMDb

<MirrorImage> alternatively, you might consider googling "List of B Movies" and see if it pops up
<Sumica> 00,10chances are if it's both lower score and or low budget it will be counted as A B movie

<Sumica> 00,10echo
<Ictiv> Shy: It's good you have Vinyl though. I for one have the Narrator who just loves to critisize me on every turn. But I know he's a great guy and is just messing with me.... *Wanders of jabbering on about nonsense*
<Sumica> 00,10still echo
<Ictiv> Try to lower your microphone feed (or what ever you call the limit at which it starts recording) BlackJack
<Shy> Like I said though, Vinyl and Kimiko are representational of each other and myself in the comic, so it's basically a comic about finding comfort in myself. c:
<Ictiv> Echoy still
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> hello
<Ictiv> Shy: Oh I know
<Ictiv> The Narrator is my evil second personality
<Sumica> 00,10it almost sounds like your mic is picking up your speakers

<Ictiv> "Why are you so frozen" ->Insta Lightning
<EspyLacopa> Who was frozen today?
<Ictiv> S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Knows
<ScootaChicken> I was frozen today!
<Ictiv> it knows
<Fleur> FluttershyOHYEAH11: and I dont know why people like dubstep
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC8zz95rm8s
<ScootaChicken> dat Michael Bay
<Ictiv> You've got a little quiet just now
<ScootaChicken> oh thank god there's people here who don't like dubstep
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> I despise it
<ScootaChicken> dubstep is awful
<Dken2021> depends, do you mean dubstep or that stuff skrillex puts out?
*Fleur just found a new friend
*Fleur is liking the chat atm <3
<Ictiv> I don't even know what Dubstep is to be honest... SI it that kind of "music" that is made of a beat and a... So the music that is made of a beat?
<Fleur> both
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> Dubstep to me sounds like "friday"
<ScootaChicken> it sounds like a baby being beaten to death by a half dead moose in a meat grinder
<Fleur> it doesnt count as music
<Fleur> it counts as som ass dicking around in FL
<Ivorilion> kill him bro
<Ictiv> Fleur: Ah... Okay, I think I'll go listen to a little Cole Porter now
<Ivorilion> KILL HIM
<Ictiv> Or maybe Jeremy Soule
<ScootaChicken> Cole Porter ftw
<Dken2021> the stuff skrillex does is brostep, or there's a drop in the song and goes bass heavy
<DubZbrony> lol it looked like metro for a second there
<Ictiv> BlackJack: I think you might be talking right now, but I can't hear a word
<DubZbrony> S´ serious sam any good?
<Fleur> what I hate most about dubstep, the people who listen to it think that anything electronic = dubstep
<Ictiv> Oh, mouse noise
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> Fleur: Same
<Fleur> >be listening to "Plasma"
<Dken2021> but that's just ignorant people
<Fleur> >someone comes up "I didnt know you like dubstep!" :D
<Fleur> >throw table at their head
<Ictiv> Fleur: Yeah like when I'm enjoying my Doctor Who, people claim it to be a Sci-Fi
<Ictiv> Except in this version, Both are good
<Ictiv> I tend to relate only to things that are good
<Ictiv> Prolongs the life you know
*Fleur hasnt tried to classify Doctor Who yet
<DubZbrony> 6_9
<Fleur> indeed
*Fleur power watches anime on netflix
*Fleur realizes that she only watches good anime on netflix
<Ictiv> That was way too much emotion for his character
<Ictiv> Show us one of your french mares
<Fleur> Spice and Wolf, Desert Punk, Popotan, Mushi-shi, Gurren Lagann, Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop, ect. shall I go on?
<Ivorilion> OH LOL
<Ivorilion> :3c
<Fleur> "Paniponi Dash!" was a good anime but I never got to finish it :(
<Dken2021> ^love it
<DubZbrony> Wow, youre computer loads Slooow man :O
<Dken2021> same here Fleur
<Ictiv> I have a quick question: Is any answer to the question "Is the answer to this question" either a paradox or indecisive?
*Fleur plucks Dken2021's cowlick and watches him deflate
<Ictiv> Is th answer to this question no?"*
<Fleur> yes
<Ictiv> Fleur: Why?
<Dken2021> wha?
<Fleur> because no
<Ictiv> Actually, you can asnwer "Not Really"
<Ictiv> Not Really=/=No
*Ictiv twists mustache.
<Ivorilion> hey Blackjack, stop looking at porn
<Ivorilion> and play the game already
*Dken2021 plays final fantasy V in the background
<Ictiv> That's what you get if you put a Raymond Smullyan book in the hands of someone like me :D
<Fleur> have you ever looked up, while falling down, while in an area where direction is negligable?
<Ivorilion> KEIKAKU DOORI
<Fleur> why did the little girl fall out of the swing?
<Dken2021> Up and Down and All Around?
<Ictiv> Fleur: Technically yes. Simply because question implies that a down direction exists, even if not for the area but relative to you
<Fleur> She had no arms.
<xcanox> Hi Ictiv.
<Ictiv> Hey xcanox
<DubZbrony> 10 min of loading screen xD
<Ictiv> BlackJack: That announcement wants me to hear you yell "SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY!"
<xcanox> DubZbrony: What are you playing?
<Fleur> but there is no sort of marker around you and if you turn you will be falling in a new direction. If you can even say you are falling and not instead accending, or not moving at all.
<Dken2021> Fleur I think this answers your question: http://youtu.be/dzBW9n313xw
<Ictiv> Thank you, thoug It seems you didn't hear demolition derby announcments before :D
<Fleur> If there is no marker around you, how do you know which direction you are moving? How do you know you are moving at all?
<Ictiv> Fleur: You don't.
<DubZbrony> All kind of stuff, Tf2, Css, MW3, Warcraft, Starcraft, stuff like that
<Ictiv> Fleur: Better question: How do you know you are looking at a scree right now?
<Ictiv> screen*
<Fleur> technically, I dont
<Fleur> I dream that I am chatting here all the time. I am not sure if this is real or fiction
<Ictiv> Fleur: Conclusion?
<Ictiv> "Who cares, Let's have fun people!"ú
<DubZbrony> What the eck´ saying youre something out of the Matrix or sum oO
<Fleur> Reality is what you make of it
<Ictiv> ^ that too
<Ictiv> And I make reality look good
<DubZbrony> Get to the Choppa!
<Fleur> lol
<FluttershyOHYEAH11> gtg bye
<Ictiv> Cya FluttershyOHYEAH11 :)
<Dken2021> bye FluttershyOHYEAH11
<DubZbrony> Run!
<Fleur> do any of you have an optomistic nature while being generaly pesemistic?
<DubZbrony> Must be hard playing, when half the game is Loading screens xD
<Ictiv> Fleur: Me
<Ictiv> Or maybe the other way around
<Ictiv> unsure
<Ictiv> I think the world is too stupid to be nice to itself, but I don't let that stop me from loving who I am and being nice to who I can be nice to
*Fleur will say that something will probably go wrong but doesnt worry because she knows that it will all be ok in the end
<Ictiv> ^
<Sumica> 00,10Expect the best prepair for the worst
<Ictiv> Though I DO say that it will be good in the end
<Fleur> exactly Sumica!
<Fleur> :D
<Ictiv> Besides. Everyone is so shook up when people talk about the end of civilization
*Fleur is always ready for failure but works her damn hardest to prevent it
<Ictiv> No one seems to notice the the universe works just fine with its beautiful nebulas and gravitational fields and time distortions without us moping about
<DubZbrony> yea just shoot for the Muzzle Flashe
<Fleur> I am not. I can handle myself
<Fleur> besides, I make friends with extrordinary ease
<Ictiv> Say somethign Spy worthy
<sam> why don't you save before the fight
<Ictiv> Strelok Dolmes
<Fleur> besides, civilization will always be here so long as there are two creatures that are near eachother
<DubZbrony> Tried turning up the Gamma, or brightness in game? oO, works for me when i cant see anything
<Nyria> Hello to all~
<Dken2021> hi Nyria
<sam> hi
<Fleur> maybe three creatures
<Ictiv> Fleur: Unless those two creatures are a Seagull and a tuna
<Nyria> What are we watching?~
<Nyria> Looks like a Metro game~
<Fleur> their civilization will be based on war Ictiv
<DubZbrony> -_- oh
<Fleur> also, that is why I said maybe 3
<Fleur> because one will have to chose a side
<Ictiv> Hm...
<sam> sleep until day
<ScootaChicken> ohai Nyria
<Ictiv> Actualyl I can see a story forming here...
<Nyria> Hey ScootaChicken ~
<ScootaChicken> my reactions are so delayed...
<DubZbrony> Hmm sorry then, was the only advice i could come up with =/
<ScootaChicken> Nyria...
<Ictiv> A Seagull, a Tuna and a dog
<Nyria> Inb4 tidle~
<ScootaChicken> your poor tilde key
<ScootaChicken> nope
<ScootaChicken> inaft4
<Ictiv> No, foget about the Tuna and the Seagull! They don't exist! They are all in the imagination of the Dog!
<Ictiv> "Woah, that is beautiful, look at me, I'm tearing up, just look at me!"
<Dken2021> oh snap, bartz hometown been sucked to the void, he's mad crazy now
<Ictiv> (Anyone got "The Majestic" refference there?)
<Nyria> So DCD or other wise known as BlackJack is streaming?~
<Ictiv> No?
<Ictiv> Nyria: Yup
<Fleur> each will either leave eachother alone (civilization based on respecting space), war over land/food (civilization bassed on war), or they will work together (civilization bassed on cooperation).
<Fleur> They can also mix the civilizations
<Ictiv> Fleur: Ah. I thought everythign else was dead in this scenario
<Fleur> plants = food
<DubZbrony> lol, no u did not!
<Ictiv> Fleur: Did you see a Seagull eat plants?
<Fleur> also, I said three
<Nyria> I do that all the time in fallout~
<DubZbrony> haha, Good luck finding it
<xcanox> Scootaloo is NOT a chicken!!
<Fleur> if only two then they can not mix the civilizations
<Ictiv> We need a good third
<Ictiv> Hm...
<Ictiv> I know!
<Ictiv> Doctor Who!
<Fleur> Ictiv: it would if it was bucking hungry
<sam> its night in the game man
<DubZbrony> Got no Nightvision? oO
<Fleur> DubZbrony: [11:49] <Fleur> maybe three creatures
<Ictiv> He'd surely check out such a scenario
<ScootaChicken> ohai xcanox
<Ictiv> Can his sonic screw driver hypnotize like The Master's?
<Ictiv> Or even better:
<Fleur> Doctor Who would love such a scenario
<Ictiv> Doctor Who gives two Fob Watches to the Seagull and Tuna
<DubZbrony> That would get me to Ragequit right about now :p
<Ictiv> and they become Time Gull and Timena
<Nyria> Doctor doctor~
<ScootaChicken> Doctor Doctor is best UFO song
<Fleur> Timey wimey chicken of the sea
*Ictiv does the awesome s:Ot
<Nyria> dat :o
*Shy jumps on Ictiv from behind and stabs him ninja assassin style
<Fleur> :o

<MadxHatter123> ...Uhh, I find don't think I should be watching DerpyHooves do that. But I cant look away.
<rainbowheaven> I was exploring. sry my first time on the moon!
<Saturn> 8,1which is his celebration of our great delicacy
<Ictiv> Since it seems there is no stream, I'm going to take a moment to give you all a piece of perfection:
<Ictiv> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m3IB7N_PRk
<Ninjapony> Cheftain Pudding, lovely :)
<Saturn> 8,1the poem actually ends saying basically "if you want to impress a girl, give her a haggis"
<LunaTheBeloved> That would impress me
*MadxHatter123 falls down well and will be back out in about 5 minutes
<MirrorImage> Haggis... if my recollection of Samurai Jack is correct, isn't that "Sheep's stomach?"
<ScootaChicken> pretty much MirrorImage
<StinkomanFan> Do I need to refresh to see stream or is it down for everyone?
<ScootaChicken> its one of the most horrible things to come out of Fair Scotland
<MadxHatter123> Heh, MirrorImage, that's how I learn what Haggis is too.
<ScootaChicken> despite what Saturn says
<Ninjapony> StinkomanFan: It's down for me
<ScootaChicken> don't listen to him
<StinkomanFan> ScootaChicken!
<Saturn> 8,1here's the entire poem, and a translation: http://www.worldburnsclub.com/poems/translations/address_to_a_haggis.htm
*StinkomanFan hug

<ScootaChicken> StinkomanFan!
<Saturn> 8,1MirrorImage, ScootaChicken, no
<MirrorImage> hmm?
<Saturn> 8,1it's boiled in a sheep's stomach as casing
<Saturn> 8,1but that's no worse than sausages
<Saturn> 8,1which are cased in pig's intestines
*rainbowheaven falls asleep on a nearby rock. "ashew, ashew, ashew"
<MirrorImage> "boiled in a sheep's stomach" - what kind of leap of faith comes up with that idea?
<MadxHatter123> I found something weird.
<LunaTheBeloved> Stream it works!!
<LulzSec> Stream!
<Saturn> 8,1the actual contents of the haggis is mainly lungs, heart, liver, oatmeal and spices
<DubZbrony> sort of
<Saturn> 8,1which are all delicious
<LunaTheBeloved> Kinda
<Ninjapony> Omnom
*IshBestKitty purrs and rubs against Fleur
<StinkomanFan> And then Wario ate everything
<Saturn> 8,1MirrorImage: in my mind, that's not as bad as the sausages
<StinkomanFan> Even raisins
<MirrorImage> so in other words, you take the rest of the sheep, shove it into the stomach of said sheep, and boil it...
<Saturn> 8,1i mean, at least poop doesn't go there, y'know?
<rainbowheaven> in case u don't know what "ashew" is, it's wut apple jack's snoring sound in Look Before you Sleep
<IshBestKitty> meow
<Saturn> 8,1MirrorImage: basically, yes
<LunaTheBeloved> Not another kitty.......
<MirrorImage> again... what kind of leap of faith comes up with that
<IshBestKitty> mew
<ScootaChicken> Scottish people, that's what
<Saturn> 8,1trust me, you find worse things in pack of sliced ham
*Fleur pets IshBestKitty and smiles

<AppIejack> howdy
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello there
<Arentius> quite a few ladies in this community here
<[SWAG]thehated5689> heyo appiejack
<Lasharus> I tend to avoid the term 'pegasister' altogether. Despite its origins, as far as I'm concerned 'brony' is genderless.
<AppIejack> bronystate y u no put AJ smilies in here :(
<TrixieMuffin> well i know of matilda and the chocolatefactory merely by name , and thats the movies , not knowing foreign childrens book authors is probably an excusable gap in my knowledge of the world
<Midnight_Tempest> yay, i like the ladies
<Arentius> none for you
<MirrorImage> Lasharus: that's because the internet itself is genderless
<Lasharus> (Plus, it just sounds ridiculous. Yes, I know, but really)
<GalladeXD> WE NEED APPLEJACK SMILIES!!!
<AppIejack> ^
<GalladeXD> *rageface*
<MirrorImage> the backlash over "Pegasister" is "omg women are trying to assert themselves," etc

<rainbowheaven> hi
<[SWAG]thehated5689> WB rainbowheaven

<ScootaChicken> hey rainbowheaven ^_^
<Lasharus> Not really MirrorImage. I just dislike the term because it sounds ridiculous.
<MirrorImage> what rule is it of the internet? "There are no women on the internet. Children are actually FBI agents."
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> Wrek?!?!
<[SWAG]thehated5689> the gender ratio in this chat is slowly tipping one way

<[SWAG]thehated5689> bai lunathebeloved
*rainbowheaven is out in the cholcolate puddled with a giant swivel straw

<Midnight_Tempest> bai LunaTheBeloved
<MirrorImage> you can see a brick coming at you
<rainbowheaven> *puddles
<Brawny> Hey everypony
<MirrorImage> good luck seeing a penny
<Ninjapony> Hi Brawny
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I think it's actually illegal to chuck pennies off the ESB
<[SWAG]thehated5689> true, but what if you throw a LOT if bricks
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Hai Brawny!
<Brawny> you can't kill someone by dropping a penny off the esb
<MirrorImage> "illegal," i doubt it. against the building rules, certainly
*rainbowheaven glomps LunaTheBeloved
<Ninjapony> SaxyPretender: Is it illegal to chuck bricks then?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...I would think so
<GalladeXD> What happens when ou throw an ANVIL off the empire state building?
<Brawny> Presumably
<Midnight_Tempest> you know whats a better stealth kill? a silenced Dragunov sniper rifle from a mile away
<GalladeXD> *you
<MirrorImage> security could probably throw you out of the building if they caught you, but i doubt that you can actually be charged for it
<MirrorImage> unless that penny manages to crack a skull
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02It's illegal to chew gum in front of a liquor store in San Francisco
<GalladeXD> XD
<[SWAG]thehated5689> why?
<Midnight_Tempest> thats retarded
<Brawny> It won't. It's too small to fight the air resistance to get to those speeds
<Brawny> It's illegal to sleep in the nude in Minnesota.
<Ninjapony> I think it is illegal to tie a giraffe to a parking meter in some state too
<GalladeXD> XDDD
<[SWAG]thehated5689> again, i propose bricks or other large heavy objects
<rainbowheaven> XD
<GalladeXD> A giraffe? Really? xD
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02And, yeah, I made up that fact :P
<GalladeXD> XD
<Brawny> I didn't make mine up
<Brawny> Unfortunately
<rainbowheaven> LunaTheBeloved is gone?! omg she left!
<Brawny> not that it's enforced or anythingf
<[SWAG]thehated5689> 70% of statistics are madde up

<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02Because you all are SILLY FILLIES
<Brawny> these aren't statistics
<[SWAG]thehated5689> i no
<rainbowheaven> i'm a silly filly!
<Ninjapony> The one about the giraffe is true, it was made in Chicago in 1962
<GalladeXD> I'm not a filly!
<GalladeXD> :O
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02:O
<TrixieMuffin> Im only 72 % Silly Filly , the other 77% are Muffin+
<Ninjapony> GalladeXD: We're all silly fillies here :D
<SuperBrony64|AFK> 10,02I liek muffins :3

<Brawny> oh lawd, it actually took me about 5 minutes to find a video of The Contact's cover of Major Tom(Coming Home)
<Brawny> I feel hipster
<GalladeXD> IT WAS ALL CAPS
<Sauceboss> hi super
<TrixieMuffin> Stallion is a male adult horse , the equivalent of a filly would be a colt right ? and foal is used for both male and female babys ?
<Sauceboss> yep

*Dumorimasoddaa reports Nyria for tilde abuse
<String_Shredder> i eat chimicherrychongas
<ekips> for example, internet explorer is good at downloading other browsers
<Ninjapony> MY cat just sleeps, that's all it does all day long
<Kammerjunk> I use Firefox because I can't bother learning the do's and don'ts of a new browser, and the Goddesses know I won't use IE.
<Nyria> Oh Dumorimasoddaa, that's my third strike~!
<StickySyrup> ekips: and thats it

<Nyria> Oh Starflash, what did I do this time?~
<ekips> our school also uses internet explorer, but we never had any virus scanners either so im not surprised
<Starflash> You're paying people to get ye out of jail~~
<StickySyrup> they waste money though.. cause people using IE end up smashing the computers
