<Sumica> 00,10we moved up movie night cause end of the world
<Vordox> Shizuka: Ya, only 1
<GabeMoist> IT'S FRIDAY NIIIIIGHT
<Vordox> Also some fun fact Shizuka Blizzard attempted to obfuscate the Butcher's identity in the game files during the Diablo III beta by assigning him a "code name", being "Withers", which like all of the Diablo III internal code names, was equestrian in nature. A "withers" is an anatomical term for a portion of a horse's shoulder area. :D
<Nicole_Hi> Blaze666: *Giggles and places my hands on my mouth*
<Cypresswolf> :D That Math
<Sumica> 00,10wait, why is it americas falt?

<Java> I think they run out of budget for a new stone
<ThunderRush> Sumica: It had a backside...wow that made me laugh.
<Kurra> Kandarihu, I honestly could care less about the Mayan calendar. I'm just being silly. XD

<Kencolt> Trivia: The Sarge shot Karl in the original novel. However, in the novel, the woman in Danger wasn't the hero's wife, but the daughter-- and she dies. The ending for the movie was rewritten for a slightly "happier" ending.

<cowvarkian> hah, that thing that isnt going to happen

<ThunderRush> Shizuka: Oh, Mystcraft is awesome. Did you played the original myst?
<cowvarkian> which would be silly

<Zamer> 4hrs of animaniacs not including the movie on the 24th
<Zamer> on the hub
<cowvarkian> OohShiny: I said that I was guessing australia, and then you said "I'm brazilian" and then I facetiously said "same thing"
<RDash5000> OohShiny: you guys ever get snow?
<OohShiny> RDash5000: In Brazil, it's summer all the year
<texasboykc09> ^
<RDash5000> OohShiny: i figured, just asking.
<Zamer> just like Alabama
<cowvarkian> and the rest of the south
<Stellafera> Wow, just got here in time for intermission
<Kencolt> OohShiny: Technically, it's not summer. It's just that winter is terribly inefficient down there.\
<texasboykc09> Sumica: lol
<Zamer> you missed Die Hard Stellafera
<RDash5000> Stellafera: you missed Die Hard

<Kencolt> OohShiny: Oh, you have winter, and it IS winter-- it just, from most people's perspective, sucks at BEING winter. ^_^
<Stellafera> Same, technically we have winter here in Arizona, but it's more like an extended spring because all the plants come back to life in the winter. They die of heat in the summer. ;)
<RDash5000> Zamer: i'm on it!
<Shizuka> 13i push a button on my phone and less than a second later hikari is booting up, 15 seconds later we have a terminal prompt

<Vordox> Start stopping Sumica
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> BATTER UP!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> MURDER!
<cratorkid> im just curious why we have everything set up the way it is, the world is round, so we could be looking at a map upside down or sideways for all we know
<Sabershy> Witnesses are eywhere.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sumica: STOP! You've violated the law!
<SpeccyRush> nice XAX , bit of the left eye is cliping through the curve there and the face is usually facing the opposite way
<flutterchu> computer is not respondning
<twilight_sprinkle> cratorkid: we chose the directions and their definitions, there are no natural directions
<GabeMoist> The dateline is the opposite side of the world as the Prime Meridian
<Kandarihu> Alright. I just bought the Deus Ex Collection, and come to think of it, I think this is getting in my way of the DXHR Augmented Edition.
<XAX> SpeccyRush: Yeah, it's facing to the right because looking right makes it look at my name when it comes up in a killcam
<SpeccyRush> XAX, oo that's clever
<cachi01> well, the new entity trailer is amazing

<cratorkid> twilight_sprinkle: that can be argued, im still curious why we chose north to be where it is, and why west isnt in its place, and why the dateline is where it is when a sphere has no begining or end, sorry, just lost in thought
<wipergone2> dem rants
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> thanks for the sandvich Phase4 xD
<wipergone2> Phase4: :D

<Kurra> I have a welovefine.com 10% off code if anyone wants to know
<Tassadork> if you actually shoot at the arms dealer?
<AJIsAwesome> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Maybe, but it's not really appropriate for thie chat.
<AJIsAwesome> *this
<otakon> DashWithRainbows: oh sure, no love for the enduring Heavy
<Kurra> I don't want it to just go to waste
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> AJIsAwesome saucy at best and that for a mod to decide i guess
<Kurra> its "2012cons" and it expires the end of March, so... go for it I guess
<DashWithRainbows> Yep, because the heavy was a potato,
<Buytoast> don't worry otakon, i got them all there money and i aint gettin a lick of praise

<sub06905|Gamecube> weeeeeeeeeee
<MirrorImage> i don't know the rules of side-lot Baseball, but i think that height is a home run
<Chrysalis> there we go
<texasboykc09> wheres the car?
<MirrorImage> Sumica - i think your car flew off the right of the building
<Goldframe> on the roof?
<sub06905|Gamecube> on the tracks?
<eraykaan> on the cloudsdale?
<MirrorImage> is that it?
<MirrorImage> by the taxi?
<eraykaan> y u no go here by dashie?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope pony63414
<MirrorImage> TOUCHDOWN
<eraykaan> *yay*
<texasboykc09> Sumica: shoot the water tank
<Goldframe> now that is funny
<pony63414> wtf...
<eraykaan> JUMP OFF!
<pony63414> again?
<eraykaan> JUMP OFF HERE!!!
<MirrorImage> can you use those stairs as a ramp?
<texasboykc09> hoped it will exploed
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> seems like it pony63414
<pony63414> this is rather annoying
<eraykaan> ded
<pony63414> [07:40:32] ->> Chrysalis :Nick/channel is temporarily unavailable
<texasboykc09> Sumica: park it on the tracks
<pony63414> this is not fun
<pony63414> not fun at all
<advisedcookie> yes
<eraykaan> hit a train!
<MirrorImage> it looks like he mistyped the command and tried to join the channel "Nick"
<eraykaan> say "i like trains"
<pony63414> MirrorImage nope
<pony63414> ./nick Chrysalis
<pony63414> i can't log in :(
<Goldframe> don't see the name active under the whois
<eraykaan> test
<eraykaan> :'(
<unfoundbug> right lets try it this way then
<unfoundbug> what, that nick is on this account
<Goldframe> Train surfing!
<MirrorImage> Goldframe - low ceiling ahead
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> unfoundbug i think there was a command to avoid the that
<texasboykc09> dead
<MirrorImage> jump off a 30 floor building in a car? 0 damage
<MirrorImage> fall off a train - LOLDED
<unfoundbug> euch i actually have to go to work now
<texasboykc09> MirrorImage: ikr
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: yeah gta 4 really lacks the ability of the prev games to hop on a vehicle, hit it to make it go fast and shoot people from there
<unfoundbug> but its gonna peave me off i couldnt log in
<Goldframe> when has physics ever worked in a GTA game?
<unfoundbug> actually, the physics are pretty good
<twilight_sprinkle> well in this case it worked, just not in favor
<unfoundbug> a little flaky
<unfoundbug> but better than msot
<unfoundbug> most*
<SirGanjalf> mornin' eveypony
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi SirGanjalf
<SirGanjalf> *every
<unfoundbug> Hai
<texasboykc09> hello SirGanjalf
<thelonecubone|BL2> Hi SirGanjalf :)
<sub06905|Gamecube> ello SirGanjalf
<eraykaan> hi sugarcube
<sub06905> dat slide
<twilight_sprinkle> Sumica: this is probably an obvious question, if skyrim runs badly on my laptop, is there any chance gta 4 would run better?
<sub06905> 10/10
<wipergone2> twilight_sprinkle: maybe
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - probably. a lot of Skyrim's performance issues could probably be chalked up to the fact that it saves EVERYTHING
<MirrorImage> including the fact that you stole that singular fork from Castle Whiterun
<eraykaan> Wait a minute! If you are in a police car... THEN YOU ARE INVINCIBLE
<twilight_sprinkle> hmm okay, maybe i should try it
<twilight_sprinkle> thx
<wipergone2> ded
<sub06905> they got one good shot on ya
<eraykaan> write "allcarsgoboom"
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: i know for sure that the lighting in skyrim was the biggest problem for me
<texasboykc09> Sumica: there was money
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - yeah, that'll do it as well
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: so i guess not much chance of gta 4 running better on that front?
<eraykaan> do u have pfone?
<MirrorImage> no, you should be fine
<twilight_sprinkle> heck, even tf2 was lagging for me a bit today
<MirrorImage> GTA4 doesn't have quite as detailed a lighting engine
<MirrorImage> what graphics settings?
<eraykaan> twilight_sprinkle: it lags me every time
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: i only set it to my laptops max resolution, didnt look at the other settings yet
<Azuredragon> Keep your eyes on the road Gentlecolts
<MirrorImage> Sumica - let me rephrase that then. it doesn't have as many objects to track (and by extension, less light/shadows to calculate)
<eraykaan> i've got some missing textures can you help me? :(
<MirrorImage> and twilight_sprinkle, a laptop will explain just as much
<twilight_sprinkle> i turned off the fancy lighting, and i even set a mod for simplified lighting in skyrim, but the lighting still hurts the fps, and i ran it on 800x600 as it is
<eraykaan> in portal 2
<Azuredragon> Or at least remember to wear a seat belt
<MirrorImage> laptops, even gaming ones, are notoriously underpowered
<Azuredragon> Apparently thay dont have those in the GTA world
<eraykaan> i've got missing textures in portal 2. Are you gonna help?
<eraykaan> "caution your blast"???
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: so if skyrim loses some framerate during battles with much lighting even though i turned everything off and have a light simplifier mod and i run it on 800x600 and i use a laptop, what are the chances of gta 4 running tolerably at least on 800x600?
<eraykaan> like a plane!
<eraykaan> like a boss parody
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - realize that Skyrim is much more "visually impressive" than GTA4
<MirrorImage> will GTA4 run well like Sumica has right now? no, probably not
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: i know, but i wanted to hear what you think of the chances, im thinking of whether i should bother trying or not
<MirrorImage> but it will almost definitely run better
<eraykaan> my friend's graphics card cant even open minecraft XD
<Evil_Spike> 5 minutes
<MirrorImage> eraykaan - that sounds like he's missing Java
<Evil_Spike> Indeed
<eraykaan> nope. bad graphics card

<Uboa-San> Pony videos on The Song of SEVERE Unhealing's Other Videos.
<Lil_B> Alchemist well, my grades are "Meh" and should be better for studying Chemistry, but the chances aren't 100% of my not getting in, but I will not have much chances making them better in the second half of this year (it's the lkast year) because it mostly consits of preparing for exams
<Alchemist> Well then just study like crazy and see what happens. You can try again 1 year later if you dont get in, right?
<Lil_B> don't quite know... I word try to get a Job if I don't get in... the other thing I could do would be trying this year over again, but that would offset my Mom, and as long as I still live here, I better not do that xD
<Alchemist> Doesnt sound that bad for a worst case scenario
<Alchemist> Leave me alone apocalypse, I have to get to level 90 http://derpy.me/eLvSg

<Moopy> Dude its not going to end my parents don't even beleave that
<Uboa-San> *believe
<therainbowvortex> it should hapan any time now oblivion awaits me
<Moopy> Well you know what dude my friends on the xbox told me that its not going to end and my parents don't think of that to as well
<Java> Man it's getting slower and slower here.
<Moopy> ikr
<Java> :/
<therainbowvortex> every thing comes to an end if not today i await the day this world burns
<Java> I ended up listening to this song on repeat. Even when I don't play the game X(
<Java> http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=P0CxIJBHBVQ
<Moopy> No dude i don't want the world to burn thats crazy man
<Java> Joker: "Everthing burn"
<AppleBloom> Java: Batman: WHEREEISHEEE!?
<Moopy> But the earth is protected like a big sheild around it
<therainbowvortex> Moopy: well time is the destroyer of all things
<Moopy> Uh huh sure like i want to beleave that
<MadSurge> But what about water? Can water burn?
<AppleBloom> therainbowvortex: if that's the case then isnt time the creator of all things aswell?
<Moopy> water can not burn water can put out hot stuff
<Buytoast> that Doom game is pretty interesting
<Java> lol hot stuff
<Moopy> im not kidding dude
<therainbowvortex> AppleBloom: that is true but nothing nothing can stop the end
<Java> Yeah, he's the best sniper
<Alchemist> Moopy: if you try to put out burning magnesium with water you will have trouble. It burns at such high temp that it will decompose the water into hydrogen and oxigen molecules and it will go boom.
<Alchemist> Moopy: so in a sense water can burn :D
<Java> Yes
<Moopy> Oh what like magma of course
<AppleBloom> I'd listen to the Alchemist, I mean just by his name I believe him
<AppleBloom> therainbowvortex: So nothing can stop the end, but without the beginning there will be no end. So if there is no beginning of the end, is there even an end?
<Alchemist> and who doesnt want to burn the whole world? :D http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61XUb28jkUI
<therainbowvortex> AppleBloom: end beging dose it really matter what is the end but the start of a new storie
<AppleBloom> therainbowvortex: right, but if the ending of the story ceases to begin, we go down a continuess path towards the end that will never stop. Thus an infinite loop toward's our demise with no end in sight.
<therainbowvortex> AppleBloom: okay im gona stop talking to u now jk
<AppleBloom> therainbowvortex: :'( you just began the end of the conversation, NOOOOOOO!!!

<AppleBloom> Java: how is the psn? I got a 360, but was curious how the psn runs
<geeky> AppleBloom: very smiler
<geeky> AppleBloom: i got both
<Java> PSN is free for online play. Also you got free games when you sign up for PSN+
<Marx> I'm doing fine geeky. The whole doomsday thing is actually already proven false by this point.
<killerpony7733> As if it weren't way way way before that
<geeky> Marx: yah cus link stoped the moon in time
<Java> 5-8 free games
<Phase4> 00,02i might just give up on this game
<AppleBloom> Java: are they any good though?
<Phase4> 00,02not going too well
<Uboa-San> Ze Lag!
<Marx> Funny you should say that geeky. That's exactly what I just did!
<Java> Bioshock 2, Infamous those stuff
<geeky> Marx: played that zelda game
<Java> they cycle the free games every couple months
<Java> you can google what free games they give to PSN+ users this month
<AppleBloom> Java: oooh infamous, its like the prototype of PSN
<Java> Boo
<Java> Prototype rely too much on gore.
<Java> Infamous is better :p
<geeky> Java: thats a bad thing
<AppleBloom> Phase4: how can you tell the games going bad? I have no idea whats happening :P
<Java> Commence the video gme flame wars :P
<JRP2234> my dogs are going ape shit
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Ninjazz> Prototype was more fun after the story.
<AppleBloom> Java: Meh, I did like prototype
<Ninjazz> Once you do all the story mission in inFamous, you're kinda done...
<Ninjazz> But Prototype you still get to play with an apocolypse.
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: that metal armour stuff looked so awesome!
<Java> Well, the story is good.I prefer to screw around in Saint Row
<Java> THQ is closing down :(
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, I did like that mode.
<Uboa-San> I once sprayed Random paint over a random neighbor. He has gone APE SHIT
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: the second Infamous is better :)
<Java> Dammit THQ, I love your games but your management is a mess.
<Ninjazz> Java, I'm just saying. Comparitively, I liked Prototype's endgame compared to inFamous.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, that I agree whole heartedly.
<Java> Oh well. That's alright
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: Just go ham on everyone with a face like this :[
<Java> Everyone have their own preferences
<geeky> IM BATMAN
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, he never shows emotion though...
<geeky> i got to go
<Ninjazz> He kinda just stays neutral about everything really.
<geeky> night all
<Ninjazz> Night Nerdy.
<DashWithRainbows> Phase needs to upgrade his melee speed.
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: yeah... Character development not so good.
<AppleBloom> night geeky
<Java> I still wait for Last of Us
<geeky> night samurizz
*geeky hugs AppleBloom
<Java> that thing is a beaut
<Ninjazz> :p
<geeky> :P
<MadSurge> Java: me too! Naughty Dog makes good games :)
*AppleBloom hugs geeky back
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, when you're a bio-weapon that can turn into a weapon BUT STILL use weapons, I couldn't care less about the damn character development.
<AppleBloom> I miss crash games >.> I miss frogger for that matter too
<Java> Ninjazz: If you want crazy fun go get Just Cause 2
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: Inweaption?
<Uboa-San> Only game of Crash i remember playing is Wrath of Cortex.
<Java> Dammit we need Crash
<Java> But planning to get Dragon Dogma.
<Ninjazz> Java, I wish I didn't just rent that game.
<AppleBloom> Java: thats what the world needs right now, A NEW CRASH GAME!
<Buytoast> Crash is dead
<Java> Conker and Crash are dead :(
<DashWithRainbows> Want me to join in, Phase4?
<AppleBloom> Buytoast: Why you gotta break my heart? :(
<Phase4> 00,02if you can
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, you know. He could use freakin helicopters. I loved that. Favorite part of that game was killing everything in those choppers.
<DashWithRainbows> Looks like you guys could use a Medic.
<Java> Spyro became toy seller :(
<Buytoast> If it isn't a realistic shooter, people won't pour their money into it.
<Buytoast> That's all the little bastards want these days
<Java> Rayman survive though
<Java> Better than ever
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: Copter hopping was awesome! Would kill one guy then use that sling like weapon to cling onto the next one
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, that's why I loved Prototype so much. Just the fact that you can do that stuff.
<MadSurge> Heard that Prototype's boss battles were a mess though
<AppleBloom> MadSurge: oh big time
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, definately.
<AppleBloom> MadSurge: Didn't make them any less awesome
<DashWithRainbows> Phase4 It disconnects me, saying that the server only accepts connections through matchmaking. Ad-hoc connections are not allowed.
<Phase4> 00,02:(
<Java> Ninjazz: with Just Cause 2 you can hook two 747 and see them flying around
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: Did you have any problems with the last boss? Because I died like 10 times before finally ending him lol
<Buytoast> that's MvM for you
<DashWithRainbows> Mmhmm.
<Ninjazz> Java, REALLY sad I only rented that game...
<Java> Go get it dude, winter sales. Also JC2 now have multiplayer.
<Buytoast> man i should've been asleep seven hours ago
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, I forgot how many times I died... And tbh, the ending wasn't worth it.
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: yeah.......... I know lol
<AppleBloom> Does anyone ever go to gamestop (or wherever you purchase games) and just buy the worst/cheapest you can find just for a good laugh?
<Java> Cheap=/=bad
<Java> Some games are too underrated
<Java> Nier for example
<MadSurge> Nier <3
<Ninjazz> I like Nier's music. Can't say anything for the game.
<Java> Ninjazz: It try to shy away from tween heroes
<AppleBloom> Java: I bought a game called stranglehold, long story short your jackie chan with dual wielding pistols that can slow time down and its called 'Tequilla mode'
<Ninjazz> Java, I have heard that.
<Java> AppleBloom: yep, finished that game too. I love every second of it.
<MadSurge> OOPS
<AppleBloom> Java: se...seriously? I laughed my butt off the whole time I played that game
<Java> AppleBloom: I love Chow Yun Fat and his movie Hard Boiled.
<Java> Also crotch shots :p
<AppleBloom> Java: are we talking just crotch shots in general?
<Java> Yes :p
<AppleBloom> Java: oh well yeah, who doesn;t like them?
<Uboa-San> Pootis?
<Uboa-San> !cd
<Tom> Episode 8 of season 3 "Apple Family Reunion" airs in 1 days, 3 hours, 29 minutes, 4 seconds (Dec 22 15:30:00 2012 UTC)
<Java> Slowmotion + crotchshots = hilarity
<AppleBloom> Tom: Is best updater
<AppleBloom> Java: Diving crotch shots, then rolling on cart in slow mode
<Java> AppleBloom: absolutely.
<Ninjazz> So let's see if they're going to throw pandas at the AJ fans tomarrow.
<Java> Okay I need to cook my dinner, brb in 1 hour.
<Java> still online though
<AppleBloom> dinner? where on earth do you live?
<AppleBloom> its 4:00 am for me lol
<Java> Java, Indonesia :p
<AppleBloom> oooooh, Hi indonesia!
<Java> 7 PM here
<Java> Hello AppleBloom :)
<Java> ok brb
<AppleBloom> kk
<Uboa-San> Phase4: Each time. Bomb Explodes.
<AppleBloom> I just one of my talking buddies... I am sad now :'(
<AppleBloom> lost one*
<CrystalPhoenix> Well I must part but before I go
<CrystalPhoenix> I must say
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/45bf91b2aa13196787dd13980d54342b.png it's not easy being regal...
<Uboa-San> Has Weak PC. Wants to play TF2
<CrystalPhoenix> if you watch any episode without thinking about the fandom
<CrystalPhoenix> there is no fan-pandering
<CrystalPhoenix> think about it
<CrystalPhoenix> anyway
<CrystalPhoenix> au revoir mes amis
<AppleBloom> CrystalPhoenix: err okay lol
<MadSurge> CrystalPhoenix: later!
<AppleBloom> CrystalPhoenix: Crystals speaking in fancy! Night though
<Ninjazz> Trixie's episode sure does confirm that. But not at the level everyone's crying about. But yeah. There's definately no pandas.
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, my queen.
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: Well obviously there's gonna be a fandom episode here and there, but give it time and people will claim it to be just another regular episode
<AppleBloom> so wait, how many episode there going to be this season?
<Phase4> 00,02you guys seeing this lag right?
<Phase4> 00,02AppleBloom, 13
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, I blame this season's feel. There's a damn reason people are crying about pandas. It's just as bad to ignore as well to exagurate it.
<Uboa-San> Yes. I do.
<AppleBloom> Phase4: is it like a mid season break and then they continue to 26? or are they gonna be wierd by ending oddly
<Phase4> 00,02no, 13 episodes
<MadSurge> There's rumors about a movie length episodes, but nothing sure
<Uboa-San> Phase4: What is causing the Game lag?
<AppleBloom> Phase4: well that stinks >.> I wanted another 26 episodes on netflix lol
<Phase4> 00,02Uboa-San, not a clie
<Phase4> 00,02clue'
<MadSurge> And it suddendly got way worse
<AppleBloom> wow
<AppleBloom> that was same seriously bad lagg
<Uboa-San> Off-Air now.
<Invi> hai everypony ^^
<AppleBloom> The ponies being shown, are they the OC'S of the sites admins? (Excluding characters obviously within the show)
<AppleBloom> hi Invi
<Ninjazz> Ohai Invi.
<AppleBloom> Invi: you missed the end of the world party we had going on here, where were you?!
<Invi> isn't the end of the world in 4 hours?
<Invi> that's what they said in tv
<Invi> wait, here was a party?
<AppleBloom> IDK ghosties was counting down. and according to Java, its 7pm where he's at. Idk if thats still yesterday or today so I think it's already passed
<Pinkieshy> what will be today's movie from movie night?
<AppleBloom> Invi: Well no not really... But we called it a party
<Invi> anyways... Ninjazz, do you have a good fanfic to suggest? :3
<aniderp|bestcakeever> i hear funny noises outside..
<Ninjazz> Invi, adventure? Romance? Comedy? Heart of a Dragon?
<AppleBloom> I would suggest a friend of mines, but he writes messed up stuff o.O
<cowvarkian> >_ >
<cowvarkian> <_ <
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: can you suggest a romance to me?
<Invi> Ninjazz, what do you mean with heart of a dragon?
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, Heart of a Dragron. But it REALLY depends on your favorite shipping. I just that one because it's one of the best written ones I've read.
<Ninjazz> Invi, my personal favorite.
<Ninjazz> I shamelessly say that one if you ask.
<Ninjazz> Every time.
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: do you have one via octavia or lyra, they my fav background :3
<Invi> hm okay i'll try it ^^
<Invi> thankies Ninjazz ^^
<Invi> AppleBloom, if you like lyra, try anthropology
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, well...I did start off with an Octavia one called Sketchy Salad Synphony. I never finished the ending chapter though.
<Ninjazz> Invi, no problemo.
<AppleBloom> okidoki I shall.
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: ooh send link, I wish to read your work
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, I didn't write it. Did I say I did?... Oops.

<Ninjazz> Oh. Damn.
<AppleBloom> hi aniderp|bestcakeever

<AppleBloom> I wish the world had ended, I stayed up too late. Gotta be at work in like 3 1/2 hours
<Invi> then get a really strong coffee
<aniderp|bestcakeever> mocha
<Invi> espresso
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, http://www.fimfiction.net/story/1506/sketchy-salad-symphony there. Next time however, you should go look it up yourself.
<d3rb> screw liquid, eat the coffee
<Invi> d3rb, my father said, i should better chew coffee beans than drinking energydrinks
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: I thought it was a none finished chapter, so I asked for the link because I figured it was none published
<d3rb> those things are junk so yeah he's probably right
<Invi> yeah, probably ^^
<Ninjazz> AppleBloom, oh. Welp. It's been done. For months.
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: also, my jaw just hit the floor from seeing all the views, upvotes and words
<Snowlight> the end of the worled!!!!!
<Ninjazz> Like I said (or at least I think I said), it was a good one. I hope you don't mind OCs though.
<AppleBloom> Ninjazz: Nah i love OC's infact. I made you own story with mine and it didn't go over near as well as yours xD

<Saturn> 08,01earth: 1
<Saturn> 08,01mayans: 0
<JRP2234> yay
<Phase4> 00,02Ninjazz, the wii had per-console encryption, these keys (or something similar) are used to authenticate with the nintendo store
<Phase4> 00,02"The robbers loaded the consoles onto trucks using the warehouse's forklifts sometime between 9pm on Saturday night and noon on Sunday and made off with them."
<Phase4> 00,02what the heck
<Invi> and then sell it on evay :D
<Invi> *ebay
<Ninjazz> Phase4, and they can pin point each one that's been stolen and track them? Welp. That's one way of keeping track of their customers.
<cowvarkian> >_ >
<cowvarkian> <_ <
<JRP2234> "The thieves broke into an air cargo warehouse and made off with 7000 Premium and Basic Wii U bundles worth a total of $2.28million according to Eurogamer's calculation."
<cowvarkian> lolwut
<JRP2234> holy shit
<Phase4> 00,02Ninjazz, i don't think its set up for that but they have enough information to do so
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Phase4> 00,02they will be able to differentiate stolen ones, then send off to the police the ip of the stolen console
<Phase4> 00,02it's not rocket science
<Ninjazz> Course not.
<Ninjazz> Well, justice be done.
<cowvarkian> so, how bout them ponies
<JRP2234> shh

<Phase4> 00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzedJZzmAMc
<Jmo> I'm not being pissy.
<cowvarkian> sure you're not
<Jmo> You should really learn what pissy is.
<cowvarkian> uh huh
<cowvarkian> cool story
<d3rb> jmo just has low tollerance for stupid, right?
<Jmo> Keep trying cowvarkian.
<Alchemist> Phase4: burgerpaul ftw :D make sure you watch all of his "I broke ..." videos :D
<cowvarkian> Jmo: thats nice
<Phase4> 00,02Alchemist, i have :)
<Ninjazz> d3rb, if that's the case, why is he here so much? >_>
<djblazekin> just like pinky pie being hyper is normal but as pinkamena depressed state we all know where that goes
<d3rb> hmmmm, good point Ninjazz
<Jmo> I'm here in hope that the chat actually gains intelligence.
<cowvarkian> Jmo: thats funny
<Ninjazz> Not near the goddamn week ends, that's for sure.
<d3rb> you will be the smart bringerer
<Jmo> My point is proven even more.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hey jaymoo you think im smart? o.O
<Phase4> 00,02if i ever get prototype 2 i'm trying that chair
<cowvarkian> *cough*
<djblazekin> do you think bullete proof windows and armed faculty keep schools safe
<cowvarkian> israel seems to think so
<djblazekin> yet america dosent
<cowvarkian> well we aren't constantly in a war with our neighbors
<cowvarkian> also, we don't have rockets shot at us every day
<d3rb> Not yet, Canada is long overdue for an invasion
<cowvarkian> they were fairly succesful last time
<cowvarkian> when they burnt down DC
<djblazekin> yeah but every two years or so a mass shooting accures
<cowvarkian> djblazekin every two years?
<cowvarkian> there were like, 5 this year
<djblazekin> i know the theater and the school where else
<Phase4> 00,02whats really disturbing about those shootings is what people blame
<d3rb> finish this sentence djblazekin, Bullet proof windows stop shootings because....
<aniderp|bestcakeever> the mall
<Phase4> 00,02everyone runs around saying 'this cause it, its that video game, arragafgsagf'
<aniderp|bestcakeever> theater,mall,school
<Phase4> 00,02no one ever seems to thing that the guy who is at fault is the one who shot people
<aniderp|bestcakeever> maybe a church also but i only heard of the theater mall and school
<djblazekin> they cant breake in
<Ninjazz> People like blaming objects because objects can't argue back. Too afraid to blame a person.
<aniderp|bestcakeever> bullets kill people
<cowvarkian> the bullets that people fire from guns
<aniderp|bestcakeever> the person who has the gun with bullets kill :\
<Alchemist> Phase4: since it is a common occurence now, people look at patterns. And the most obvious one is that all incidents included guns :D
<String_Shredder> Phase4: And the Westboro jerks are saying "Oh, God toldm him to do this because of all of the gay people and gay supporters" or some crap like that.
<rdibp> HAPPY DOOMSDAY EVERYPONY!
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: guess I'm careless then, because I always call the shooters "that asshole"
<cowvarkian> String_Shredder: lel wat
<MadSurge> Hi rdibp!
<d3rb> hey rdibp
<Phase4> 00,02String_Shredder, yeah but thats westboro, i honestly dont give a crap about anything they say
<aniderp|bestcakeever> if someone killed me because im lesbian.. that is a hate crime :\
<cowvarkian> pdidr yeh
<cowvarkian> *pbidr
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, get on the news.
<djblazekin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIY41LrvMFQ
<djblazekin> apocallyps pony
<rdibp> thats cool naikravwoc
<Ninjazz> No seriously. I haven't heard one person blame the guy.
<Alchemist> thats because the guy was mentally ill and people usually blame the illness and not the person. Its quite common.
<cowvarkian> one real people, or just TV people
<rdibp> Death Pony is best pony
<djblazekin> yea thay always blame games and guns but not the person
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: my mom always says "if they're so eager to kill why don't they shoot themselves first"
<cowvarkian> hah
<Ninjazz> Well IF ONLY.
<MadSurge> Ikr
<Phase4> 00,02another big problem is a lot of people honestly think its as simple as 'ban guns'
<Alchemist> MadSurge: because they want to hurt others?
<Phase4> 00,02thats whats happened here, there was a lot of knifings, so they baned knives, there are still a lot of knifings
<djblazekin> cuz half the murderers kill themselves after the rampage despite either way the burn in hell
<Alchemist> asking "why kill others" in these situations is pointless.
<Phase4> 00,02and yes, we have laws against pointy things in victoria, its quite silly
<cowvarkian> pointy things...
<MadSurge> Alchemist: the bad thing is that they often commit suicide at the end, so why don't they skip the shooting innocents part
<rdibp> my school was just on tv talking about someone bringing a gun to school
<rdibp> we are not allowed to bring backpacks
<Ninjazz> Phase4, are they going to ban sticks in the near future?
<Phase4> 00,02Ninjazz, i wouldnt put it past them
<Ninjazz> Lel.
<rdibp> lel
<Alchemist> MadSurge: thats assuming they think rationally. In their mind killing others and ragequitting is a perfectly logical procedure...
<Phase4> 00,02whats really funny is the way they class weaponry, i don't have the details but suposedly a japanese katana ends up being clasafied the same as a kitchen knife
<cowvarkian> lawl
<rdibp> lwal
<Phase4> 00,02so you can legally carry one around
<Alchemist> Here any knives which are longer than 4 inches are illegal to wear. Switchblades are illegal regardless of size.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: you must have a license here to have a gun and there are still a lot of hate crimes here. Still, not many mass shootings
<djblazekin> seriously they might as well have up naked cuz anyone can kill anyone with just about anything
<Phase4> 00,02but if it is a sword, then you need a licence
<Phase4> 00,02djblazekin, i'm prety sure i could do damage even if naked
<Phase4> 00,02they'd have to ban motion entirely
<cowvarkian> I'm sure it'll happen eventually
<MadSurge> Just be buff enough or hit people with a big enough object
<rdibp> Putting a ban on guns will not put a stop to crime. Shooting up a bank can land you in prison so whats the difference of if guns are illiega;
<Phase4> 00,02rdibp, thats exactly what people dont get
<Phase4> 00,02no one accounts for black markets
<cowvarkian> don't they just want to renew the ban on assault weapons?
<djblazekin> exactly with just the guies hand he killed a perve who was sexually assaulting his daughter bare fist
<Phase4> 00,02which are verry real things
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I'm still uncertain if banning weapons ever solves the problem. Problem being getting people to shut up. Even if weapons are banned and crimes happen less, they ARE going to happen. Maybe not as controversial but it's going to happen and people are going to complain.
<Phase4> 00,02banning weapons won't solve anything
<Alchemist> Ninjazz: no law in the world will make certain crimes disappear. The point is to lower the occurence.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Good afternoon everyone :)
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: I'm not saying "ban guns", I'd just like more severe requirements to get one in America
<Ninjazz> Alchemist, the cycle will just continue.
<Phase4> 00,02afternoon MLP_Brovakiin
<rdibp> hai MLP_Brovakiin
<Phase4> 00,02and then you have the psychological effects of banning, ever read about the alcohol prohobition?
<djblazekin> cant wait till the new ep
<Alchemist> Ninjazz: Im sure they will happen one way or the other, but will there be less or more?
<Phase4> 00,02djblazekin, neither can i :3
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, that would help. But would that help everyone? I wouldn't think so.
<Ninjazz> Alchemist, that's the plan.
<MadSurge> Phase4: no need to, I already know how it went :D
<rdibp> djblazekin: but the mayans arent though
<Ninjazz> Alchemist, less, misread.
<Alchemist> Ninjazz: besides, seeing how it comes down to cultural differences, I cant really argue about this.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: it's just that anyone can point a gun and shoot, but less people have the nerve and the guts to knife someone :D
<rdibp> i heard something about allowing firearms to teachers
<Phase4> 00,02what seems to be happening here is because knives are banned, having one becomes a status symbol
<MadSurge> Pfft
<Phase4> 00,02i imagine exactly this would happen with guns in america
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Ninjazz> MadSurge, well I've always thought that a person has a right to defend himself at least. Having a gun, knife or whatever shouldn't be taken away from himself if he wants to be safe.
<cowvarkian> probably
<Ninjazz> Alchemist, it is hard to argue about. Since one thing that works in one place doesn't seem to work in another or doesn't flat out work at all.
<Phase4> 00,02^^^^^^^^^^^
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: I dunno, all I have is a better lock on my door :D (also plenty of kitchen knives if needed"
<djblazekin> heck in japan only military and police can have guns the rest of cociety well have thier tools
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: that too
<Phase4> 00,02this kind of thing is very sensetive to culture, one population would reject prohibition, another would acceptr
<Phase4> 00,02accept it'
<Phase4> and i feel my colour is distracting
<cowvarkian> good
<cowvarkian> because it is
<MadSurge> I like colours though :)
<Phase4> 09,02M03,02a06,02d04,02S07,02u08,02r09,02g03,02e06,02,04,02 07,02o08,02 09,02r03,02l06,02y04,02?
<Sylandest> saw that coming :D
<djblazekin> according to som nuthead on fb the zombies will rise on the 22nd
<cowvarkian> those colors
<Ninjazz> Tempted...
<Phase4> Sylandest, /)
<String_Shredder> Hi djblazekin! I've heard so much about you.
<Sylandest> also, morning, everypony :)
<Sylandest> Phase4: (\
<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai again Sylandest :p
<d3rb> morning Sylandest
<MadSurge> Phase4: yarly :D
<Sylandest> howdy again MLP_Brovakiin, and d3rb :)
<djblazekin> String_Shredder: what
<String_Shredder> Ah, the chat went silent for a minute! Everyone, go back to having the IQ of a lima bean!
<cowvarkian> no, thanks
<Ninjazz> I think lima beans have are smarter than chat most times...
<Phase4> ^
<aniderp|bestcakeever> cya work time
<Phase4> some of the people in here are... yeah
<Ninjazz> >_>
<Phase4> right now though its great :3
<Phase4> prince-dari, learn 2 auto ident
<Alchemist> they drop 2 more IQ points and they'd start to photosynthetize?
<prince-dari> Normally does
<prince-dari> I must have DCed
<String_Shredder> Ninjazz: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdz3c09QsO1qg898o.jpg

<MLP_Brovakiin> Ohai DerpyMuffins :)
<Phase4> strange
<DerpyMuffins> Hmm, still alive
<prince-dari> I just have it set to ident for current nick rather than prince-dari specifically
<Phase4> prince-dari, why doesnt it ident after a diconnect?
<Phase4> oh
<Phase4> prince-dari, you know this network lets you specify the nickname in the ident
<prince-dari> Yeah, I just haven't really thought about changing it
<XxNightHawk64xX> happy apocalypse day
<prince-dari> Or I'm too lazy
<prince-dari> Either way
<prince-dari> XD
<Phase4> i know the feel
<Phase4> alternatively you could use sasl, i'm not certin how thats implimented though
<Phase4> i've got my client using it so it idents before joining channels, some channels on freenode need that
<valoreins> hello~?

<Kipkat07_Scarf> wat
<Jake> Because there is a mlp marathon right now on the hub.
*Kipkat07_Scarf never used AOL
<rdibp> :O STREAM IT!
<ScootaChicken> Also djblazekin, you do realize that the point of bringing new streamers on is to improve the site quality, not degrade it, right?
<Swiftheart> I know, I don't get the hub.
<Jake> but some mod here does....
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I should watch ponies, I hear it cures everything
<rdibp> i dont have the hub either :'(
<Ninjazz> I have no words.
<alexxm> hey guys
<Jake> if i had the hub i would never visit bronystate and that would be sad
<rdibp> well, apparently Link saved us all once again
<String_Shredder> Kipkat07_Scarf: Cartoons cannot have healing properties. Sorry.
<Swiftheart> They can make you feel happy.
<Jake> well actually they can heal on a psychical level
<rdibp> String_Shredder: i heard that the rate of heart attacks and diabeetes went up since season 3 aired
<Jake> ...true story
<alexxm> so what have you guys been up to
<Jake> getting a mod to stream hub right now
<djblazekin> hey i also have metal gear hd collection and mortal kombat along wit c o d bo declassified among some psp titles and ps1 titles like parasite eve and crash bandicoot warped
<Swiftheart> Well I have bunch a snow in my front yard.
<djblazekin> same here
<rdibp> Swiftheart: you're saying it like its a bad thing
<Jake> I have a bunch of ice in my yard...
<rdibp> :3
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I cant watch ponies on hub because I force myself to 3 eps per week on bronystate. If I watch too many episodes, I'll become bored and desensitized to MLP.
<rdibp> i have a bunch of grass in my yard :'(
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I dont have a yard
<cowvarkian> rdibp: most do
<Swiftheart> I'm sick so I can't do anything
<Swiftheart> :(
<Jake> i have a bunch on ponies on my tv
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Swiftheart: join the club :3
<rdibp> i want to see snow one day :(
<MLP_Brovakiin> rdibp: Google is your friend
*Kipkat07_Scarf used to live in florida and didnt know what snow was like till he moved to Utah for a year and a half
<rdibp> Swiftheart: have you noticed all the people getting sick recently? THIS IS HOW IT BEGINS! :O
<Kipkat07_Scarf> THIS IS THE APOCALYPSE!! :o
<Jake> people catching a cold when waiting for aliens?
<Swiftheart> NOOOOOO
<Kipkat07_Scarf> a lot of kids at my school werre sick
<Kipkat07_Scarf> including me
<DerpyMuffins> Inb4 S3 is cancled
<MadSurge> Pfft
<Jake> ping me when someone decides to stream. I'm back to borderlands now
*Kipkat07_Scarf would kill himself if that happened
<String_Shredder> Jake
<rdibp> DerpyMuffins it already began :3
<cowvarkian> thats idiotic
<rdibp> Jake
<cowvarkian> ekaJ
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I have severe emotional problems and three doeses of pony per week keeps me stabel
<Kipkat07_Scarf> *stable
<cowvarkian> meh ok then
<Jake> what have I gotten myself into...
<Swiftheart> Could you stream the MLP marathon on the hub?
<DerpyMuffins> Mood swings?
<Ninjazz> There just arn't any words.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> no, just inferiority complex. I have a huge ego to protect myself from my failures
<rdibp> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVmB3lRjCmc something relevent :3
<cowvarkian> lel no
<rdibp> lel yes?
<cowvarkian> lel maybe
<rdibp> :-D
<Swiftheart> lol
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I actually leveled myself off when I became a brony and now I have ponies to help increase my happiness levels and reduce stress
*Kipkat07_Scarf is awesome
<cowvarkian> thats interesting
*Kipkat07_Scarf is better than you at history
*cowvarkian doubts this
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ^ my ego
<rdibp> its been a good year http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOAOyypPvSM
<prince-dari> I bet that depends on whose history you're talking about.
<prince-dari> Because if you mean American, then it's so recent you can barely call it history
<Kipkat07_Scarf> prince-dari: WWII history to be exact
<prince-dari> :P
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I have actually stalemated a history debate with my vice principal who was a history teacher. Not a bad start
<Kipkat07_Scarf> ask me a history question. I must train myself.
<String_Shredder> ScootaChicken: Spotted dick is quality.
<Swiftheart> I asked my principal if he was a brony.
<rdibp> Kipkat07_Scarf: where was derp when herp was derping?
<Swiftheart> That was earlier in the year though
<ScootaChicken> Kipkat07_Scarf: Tis a shame that no one here actually cares then.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> rdibp: 42
<rdibp> CORRECT!
*Kipkat07_Scarf rolls in his now inflated ego
*cowvarkian pops Kipkat07_Scarf 's ego with a pin
*String_Shredder rolls in his already quite large ego
<rdibp> the fire of friendship lives in our hearts (cont...)
<String_Shredder> the fire of old episodes live in youtube (cont...)
*Kipkat07_Scarf rolls over cowvarkian and crushes him under his ego that he patched up with a pony band-aid
<cowvarkian> hmm
<Sceptileknight> hello
<rdibp> hai
<cowvarkian> hey
<Swiftheart> howdy
<rdibp> NARF

<Ninjazz> Welcome to it.
*Kipkat07_Scarf 's back hurts
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Ninjazz: But... were on bronystate. This is the polar oppisite of hell
<DerpyMuffins> Hell looks alot likeh ome
<DerpyMuffins> home

<Kipkat07_Scarf> Ninjazz: hmmm... lets see... Benny Goodman and Peggy Lee playing music in the background and bronystate.... seems like heaven to me
<rdibp> >_> <_<
<Ninjazz> Then I'd hate to see your hell.
<rdibp> hell isnt so bad. i mean it has wi-fi.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Ninjazz: Being in a room with people of low intelligence (i.e. my school)
<Ninjazz> I'm done.

<Gray_Ham> I understand a moment of silence for the victims of the massacre
<Gray_Ham> but all the kids in Conneticut?

<Kipkat07_Scarf> I live in CT and I hope the guy who did it roasts in hell but is it bad that I didnt cry? I feel great remorse for them all but I never cried. I think I might still be a bit in denial that this could happen in my state.

<prince-dari> We're going to be around a lot longer than that unless we get unlucky with a meteor.
<MadSurge> cachi01: better late than bever
<alexxm> so has anyone here read leauge of extrodrinry gentlemen
<cachi01> alexxm: i really dont fucking know lel
<nightwatchman> I'm just waiting for Galactus to eat the earth.
<Ninjazz> prince-dari, you say unlucky. I saw freaking finally.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> I prepare for the apocalypse. I dont have a life so I choose to prepare for the US's eventual invasion
<Ninjazz> say*
<Rocket> prince-dari i think that we will have alot wars and peaces then again wars
<MadSurge> prince-dari: and we could also finally go to space one day
<prince-dari> Kipkat07_Scarf: What the fuck are you talking about?
<cachi01> nightwatchman: meh the avengers will save us
<rdibp> rdibp going out the way he lived
<prince-dari> Ninjazz: Why?
<rdibp> *turns a page of playpony*
<cachi01> oi i want that magazine
<alexxm> so anyone read league of extrordriny gentlemen
<nightwatchman> cachi01 or the fantastic four.
<cachi01> alexxm: watched the movie lol
<Ninjazz> prince-dari, aside from my bitter annoyance at the world for being shit today and pretty much every day, no reason other than wanting to see it burn.
<alexxm> cachi01 what did you think of it
<rdibp> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB_sZA2pJdc
<Rocket> Ninjazz youre right
<prince-dari> MFW people say they want the world to be destroyed
<Alchemist> in this form we wont be able to exist too long. We are using more rescources for energy than the earth can provide it for us. Once we run out of energy well be back in the stone age.
<rdibp> for no raisen :)
<cachi01> alexxm: i think it was good. the little i remember about it
<MadSurge> prince-dari: Ikr
<prince-dari> MFW they're all talking bullshit and would be crying their eyes out if it were to come about
<Kipkat07_Scarf> prince-dari: I think america is overdue for an invasion. We think we are the rulers of the world and our country is full of idiots. Lucky Romney didnt win though. Id've been the UK or Canada the next day
<cachi01> prince-dari: lol
<prince-dari> Unless you're literally a total mental case who will one day snap and kill 30 people you don't want the world to end.
<MadSurge> Enough pessimist talk guys :|
<rdibp> Alchemist: well no matter what we o we are all going to die, so lets wreck the place and party
<rdibp> do*
<Ninjazz> I just want people to shut up.
<cachi01> prince-dari: and also kill ur mom.
<cachi01> and then commmit suicide
<prince-dari> Yep
<prince-dari> Seriously, why even say that?
<MadSurge> rdibp: but let's not leave a mess, ok? :D
<prince-dari> You don't want the world to end.
<Alchemist> rdibp: meh.
<cachi01> god.........why the fuck did that asshole killed those kids.
<cowvarkian> cachi01: because he did
<prince-dari> You don't wish for the deaths of your entire family, all of friends, and every human being on this planet.
<Kipkat07_Scarf> cachi01: Because humans are horrible creatures.
<rdibp> wow, adobe crashe for some reason
<rdibp> crashed*
<Alchemist> rdibp: it crashes about 2-3 times a day for me. you just get used to it.
<Ninjazz> I told you why. Don't act like that when I told you why.
<Rocket> rdibp saved ?
*rdibp goes on an adventure to find adobe in Nairobi
<cachi01> you wont find adobe
<cachi01> HERE IN NAIROOOOOOBIIIIIIIIIII
<prince-dari> You told me why?
<rdibp> put they do have spectacular hotels :$
<Ninjazz> Yep.
<prince-dari> Because you 'want people to shut up' is good reason for the decimation of the entire human race?
<Jay-Kay> uh
<cowvarkian> apparently taffy
*Kipkat07_Scarf is sad because Neil Armstrong died this year
<cachi01> rdibp: http://scratch.mit.edu/static/projects/asicthehedgehog/2361465_med.png but we sure have great hedgehogs!
<Ninjazz> In a hyperbole way, yeah.
<cowvarkian> *hyperbolic
<Ninjazz> Besides, we'll kill each other off soon enough.
<Rocket> In my personaly opinion, humans need to learn how to use our inteligence
<cowvarkian> hah, no
<rdibp> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwYKKTGBDlU
<cowvarkian> *saying hah no to Ninjazz not Rocket
<prince-dari> Well now you're saying it was hyperbole, before you were just saying 'I want to see the world burn'
<nightwatchman> okay i'm sensing hostility. let's change the subject shall we? :)
*Gray_Ham is sad because Neil Armstrong, Ravi Shankar, Dave Brubeck, Damne Elizabeth Murdoch etc. have all passed away this year
<Ninjazz> Thanks for making that clear, cowvarkian.
<rdibp> and that guy from Armeggedon
<Rocket> nightwatchman good idea
<XAX>  
<Ninjazz> prince-dari, I also stated how bitter I was in that statement.
<prince-dari> Which conveys that it's exaggeration in what way?
<nightwatchman> so... star wars episode 7. anybody excited?
<Kipkat07_Scarf> prince-dari: I dont hope humans get destroyed, I just hope that humans learn live with the planet instead of being parasitic lifeforms that suck the planet dry
<cachi01> lel
<cachi01> suck the planet
<cachi01> lel
<rdibp> lelel
<Rocket> lele
<Kipkat07_Scarf> Oh god... I just realized... I SOUND LIKE A HIPPIE!!! *screams nooooooo!*
<alexxm> shut up with the lel or your not going to disney world
<Ninjazz> You said it. I don't wish the deaths of the entire world to come to pass. I just want people to shut up about it not happening. And maybe stop being stupid for a good few minutes.
<Jay-Kay> sounds good
<Ninjazz> You were willing to read between the lines, weren't you?
<nightwatchman> Man of Steel comes out this summer. the trailer is amazing! I cried a little.
<cachi01> aaaaaaand i cant die yet
<Rocket> nightwatchman try harder :D
<cachi01> i still hhave to see entity >.>
