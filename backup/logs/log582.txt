<oni_link> Whoa,Mario Party?
<cachi01|mobile> Mario party gets worse every year
<cachi01|mobile> Best mario party is.4
<Alpha-Omega_> Well you can build your own ponyville
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This is actually the best Mario Party game that's come out in a while
<oni_link> I think 2 is best Mario Party
<Phase4> 00,02luigi is best player
<cachi01|mobile> The series died on number 6
<SuperBrony64> 11,02And yes, Mario Party 4 was the best :3
<Dark_of_Max> XD hi every 1
<lowfn> I leave for 2 minutes to go potty and you guys have already gone all mario in here
<SuperBrony64> 11,02The series died on 5
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hai Dark_of_Max :3
<noname> cachi01|mobile: They tried to make a change :\
<cachi01|mobile> Phase4 Heck yeah!
<oni_link> Hello Dark_of_Max
<OtakuTom> I'm sorry, SB, but I have to greatly disagree with you. I thought 9 was the single worst Mario Party game ever.
<Dark_of_Max> C:
<cachi01|mobile> Now fortune street
<cachi01|mobile> Thats a piece of
<Dark_of_Max> hi SuperBrony64
<cachi01|mobile> CRAP
<oni_link> OH I know what this is. Its "Luigi wins by doing absoulutely nothing" !
<Souporcat> lol
<noname> I just wished you had the normal stars instead of "mini stars"
<lowfn> Troll Card
<Ponies47> Chat is ded :(
<SuperBrony64> 11,025 was the worst Mario Party game.
<oni_link> hey Ponies47
<TheRandomkid321> Well I just gave a TF2 F2Per their first hat...
<cachi01|mobile> 5 was meh
<Ponies47> Hey oni_link
<SlurryMoon> 3I really loved 5 :<
<cachi01|mobile> I think 8 was the worst
<Spectrum_Rush|> what just happed there
<oni_link> Ponies47: how ya been?
<SlurryMoon> 38 is the worst
<Dark_of_Max> i just it was 11:34 i fell sleep and is now 2:04 XD
<Alpha-Omega> Also I'm not sure how the game will be but it is coming out this year. Gameloft refuses to reveal details and hasbro is giving them license thor the creation as well as helping them create the game
<noname> 5 was the first mario party I got :(
<SlurryMoon> 3eight is the worst imo
<TheRandomkid321> I feel like I have commited a crime of sorts...
<lowfn> Weegee wins by doing absolutley nothing
<Ponies47> oni_link: Good thank you. You? :3
<SlurryMoon> 3I enjoyed my time with 5
<SlurryMoon> 3I did not enjoy my time with 8
<cachi01|mobile> 5 was fun
<TheRandomkid321> I ahve played the original mario party
<OtakuTom> I had a ton of fun playing 8.
<Shizuka> 13vivi ist not worst :<<<
<Phase4> 00,02SlurryMoon, dat colour script
*Spectrum_Rush| sees title... ooooooooh
<oni_link> Guys, guys. Its LITERALLY Luigi wins by doing absolutely nothing, its a youtube series :D
<SlurryMoon> 3nothing I can do to fix that problem Phase4
<cachi01|mobile> 5 had 3 special games
<SlurryMoon> 3Unless there is
<Phase4> 00,02SlurryMoon, there is
<SlurryMoon> 3No one has told me
<Phase4> 00,02depends on how your colouring though
<cachi01|mobile> Which i had shitload.of fun with them
<lowfn> Wait whos streaming?
<Phase4> 00,021 mine handles numbers just fine :P
<TheRandomkid321> What is the difference between + and @?
<oni_link> Ponies47: Ah, well today could have been better but it all good now that Im comfy cozy and on Bronystate :P
<cachi01|mobile> + is.voice
<Spectrum_Rush|> SuperBrony64: thats you in the middle right?
<cachi01|mobile> @ is.mod
<Ponies47> oni_link: Goodie ^^
<OtakuTom> I really hated 9, 'cause I felt the minigames were bad, plus the change to how you navigate the board. It no longer has that "board game" feel it used to have, which is where it really excelled in the past.
<Phase4> 00,02"* SlurryMoon has quit (Excess Flood)" and this is why we dont copy paste scripts via irc :P
<lowfn> Who is sttreaming?
<SlurryMoon> 3but I like to
<cachi01|mobile> Lol
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Spectrum_Rush|: Yesh
<oni_link> Ponies47: i dont wanna go to work tomorrow
<cachi01|mobile> Dont go
<cachi01|mobile> Get some beer
<OtakuTom> Just trying to unlock the extra boards and characters in 9 is a huge pain in the butt, to the point where I never finished it. I got screwed over so many times by the "random" numbers that I was repeating boards constantly due to a single roll.
<cachi01|mobile> Burn your pants

<Ponies47> noname: Maybe I did. I mean my step brother is a total kiss(squee) to my brother and my brother USE to be a parasprite. I sort of think my step bro does like MLP but he's pretending to hate MLP to look cool around my bro. My step brother doesn't know that my brother isn't a parasprite anymore and is just nuetral :P

<Starflash> heheh
<Starflash> It's still awesome though x3
<OtakuTom> I need to buy more of their music.
<oni_link> Wrek: Mind you, this isnt a gaming laptop at all. Its an 08 macbook pro... this is why I want my desktop already... I want more power
<Dovah> 3 hours b-b-but I need sleep?
<OtakuTom> I'm buying a new gaming laptop in the next month or so.
<oni_link> OtakuTom: lucky, how much are you spending on it?
<OtakuTom> There's some real good ones out there right now for around $1,200
<noname> Dovah: see that big red X button? click it and all your problems are solved :P
<Wrek> 05mine isnt opted for gaming either, but for 3D and work n stuff
<Wrek> 05gona cram anotehr 8 in once i can afford it htough

<Ponies47> *some
<P4ngya> i need 64bit, cant take 32 much longer
<oni_link> OtakuTom: yeah theyre getting to be more affordable but im gonna go all out on a full tower and spend that much too :D
<fluffle_puff> Lol, how can Twilight read with all that screaming going on?
<Dovah> night Ponies47
<noname> Night Ponies47, have fun tomorrow :)
<noname> Dovah: what will you do if your internet goes off then? :P
<oni_link> bye *hugs Ponies47 tight*
<killerpony7733> fluffle_puff: A calm mind?
<OtakuTom> I have a full tower already with basically the same specs as the laptop I'm planning on getting, so I'll have a portable version :P
<Ponies47> I might get to come on 1 more time before we head out. So will just have to see :P
<Dovah> noname: kung fu action jesus
<noname> can't argue with taht
<noname> that*
<oni_link> OtakuTom: nice. I think Ill get more ram for this thing but after I get my tower. Thats gonna be my baby :D
*Ponies47 Hugs oni_link back
<OtakuTom> Gah! Sabaton was just here in Chicago a couple months ago! How did I miss that?!
<noname> OtakuTom: bad luck?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i want a better pc but i can't justify the price until this laptop can't handle to work, wich knowing me will be for another 3 to 5 years if nothing outside my control happens to it :p
<SlurryMoon> another test
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6417270784
<SlurryMoon> test again
<SlurryMoon> odd
<OtakuTom> Now I'm sad. I really want to see them. I'm also hoping Van Canto finally comes to the US.
<FlutterShy2000> hello
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also SAI cost 60 bucks ;A; and i'm broke right now
<OtakuTom> Hello FlutterShy2000

<SlurryMoon> 03 So from now on I'll have a space before my text
<OtakuTom> lol
<Chrysalis> desktops for the true master race
<SlurryMoon> 03 I hope you can accept my oddity
<SlurryMoon> 03 I don't want to be an outcast ;A;
<Chrysalis> of course SlurryMoon ~
*oni_link accepts SlurryMoon 's oddity
<Wrek> 05we still love you even if you are different SlurryMoon <3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis well can't afford anything else and i need it for school ._.
<noname> Night Ponies47, have a fun day tomorrow :)
<Dovah> SlurryMoon: I actually didnt notic it until you pointed it out
<OtakuTom> See you later Ponies47
<Chrysalis> TheGreatAndPowerfulT building an equivelant desktop would be cheaper ~
<SlurryMoon> 03 :3
<SlurryMoon> 03 okay, so now I can say this:
<SlurryMoon> 03 1 2 buckle my shoe
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis can't take a desktop to programming class ....
<SlurryMoon> 03 3 4 open the door
<oni_link> Chrysalis: im sure they need the portablity
<oni_link> *portability

<XAX> SlurryMoon: Congratulations.
<TrixieMuffin> but its 1 2 Freddy comes for you
<Dovah> Alright must leave befor another song starts bai!
<Ponies47> noname: It will eb hell for the car ride but it will be worth it. Plus I shall be wearing *Pulls out his Brony shirt* this. Oh this gonna be a fun. Lets see how many brohoofs I get or shout outs or what :P
<Ponies47> *be
<Ponies47> Bye Dovah
<oni_link> Ponies47: I wish you the best XD
<killerpony7733> Dat sign
<noname> Ponies47: which reminds me, what is the brony shirt? rainbow dash? :s
<Ponies47> oni_link: This is gonna be FUN. :3
<oni_link> Ponies47: hahaha i know!
<OtakuTom> Chrysalis, I'm getting a laptop with Windows 7, 1TB hard drive, 8GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 660M graphics, and 17 inch 1920x1080 display for $1,200. That's comparable to my current gaming rig and will cost me LESS.
<Ponies47> noname: It just says BRONY and has Rainbow Dash is on it. She's just black I think it's like her shadow or somthing. The only that has colors is her cutie mark but I like it ^^
<Chrysalis> and how olds the rig
<OtakuTom> Including bluray drive. Forgot to mention that, too.
<OtakuTom> Less than a year old.
<oni_link> OtakuTom: Wow
<noname> Ponies47: i've seen it before, somewhere, it looks cool :)
<Ponies47> noname: Got mine at Hottopic also got a DJ PON-3 shirt and brony wristband :P
<Chrysalis> ooh yeah you heard how were fucking up the olympics already?
<Chrysalis> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/7/25/o-bBEcngZ0eIQ9GBkS8Uvw2.jpg
<Spectrum_Rush|> Conglaturation SlurryMoon you have conpleted a great rhyme and prooved the justice of your will now go and rest our heroe!
<killerpony7733> Chrysalis: Yep saw it in the news today
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6411160576
<OtakuTom> Am I missing something in the pic that Chrysalis just linked?
<Chrysalis> OtakuTom thats a north korrean footballer
<Wrek> 05i dont get it Chrysalis...
<OtakuTom> Ah
<Chrysalis> next to a south korrean flag
<Wrek> 05oh
<Chrysalis> they refused to play
<Wrek> 05tough luck
<OtakuTom> Yea, once you said North Korean, I understood the mistake :P
*Spectrum_Rush| Chrysalis joke --> my head V
<Chrysalis> hmm http://cheezburger.com/6453349888
<Chrysalis> what happens if you take an opening ceremony
<Chrysalis> and throw up british
<OtakuTom> I don't know. I think the report that security is supposedly supposed to prevent access to anyone wearing clothing advertising products that compete with the sponsors was pretty bad...
<Chrysalis> OtakuTom theyv been doing that at wimboldon for YEARS
<Ponies47> Ok for real I'm going to bed now. But before I go you may say your goodnights and tell me a bed time story :P
<noname> Ponies47: haha, night, hope you have a fun day tomorrow :)
<Ponies47> Oh I will :P
<oni_link> Ponies47: There was once a lad who had a brother who he very much disliked his brother. He made it his life goal to be a sucess and never have to take any of his crap anymore. That kid is you. goodnight. :)
<Spectrum_Rush|> Wrek: who's currently playing?
<OtakuTom> I wasn't aware of that happening at Wimbledon. I think that's kinda crazy. Someone wearing a Pepsi shirt where Coke is a primary sponsor doesn't detract from Coke getting all their normal advertising (using Coke as an example since they're a sponsor for the Olympics)
<oni_link> lol dat repeat
<Ponies47> oni_link: :3
<oni_link> but youre gonna go far kid :D
<Wrek> 05Spectrum_Rush|: sabaton
<OtakuTom> Spectrum_Rush|: Sabaton
<Spectrum_Rush|> danke Wrek OtakuTom :)
<noname> oni_link: is there a conclusion to that story? whats gonna happen to the brother? The suspence is killing me.
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6402008832
<oni_link> noname: the brother became a servant to the younger successful brother and he lived happily ever after in his castle :D
<noname> oni_link: :D
<oni_link> OtakuTom: okay... are you ready for this? so you remember how my laptop was scraping by for minimum sys reqs? look at this. same machine, same website... how does this happen?http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/analysis.aspx?name=Dead+Space+2&id=11104
<oni_link> noname: I like telling stories :D
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6394473984
<Wrek> 05love this one
<oni_link> OtakuTom: wrong link here it is
<noname> oni_link: BEST. STORY. EVER. :D
<Chrysalis> thegt90 ikr
<OtakuTom> It doesn't let me pull up your specs directly like that :P
<oni_link> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77751705/lolwut.png
<oni_link> noname: lmao glad you liked it
<Malmortius> i hate my life right now, sucks so bad. 3 girls wanna date me but i dont know which one to choose
<P4ngya> lol mal
<P4ngya> ur lucky
<oni_link> Malmortius: what are your preferences and what are your options?
<Malmortius> i like redheads
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> >My life sucks > 3 girls want to date me > Does not compute
<oni_link> Malmortius: is there a redhead amongst these 3?
<OtakuTom> oni_link, that actually does make sense. Your build still looks fine, other than the fact that you're still running 32-bit Windows :P
<Malmortius> yes oni but not natural :l
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6391906304
<oni_link> OtakuTom: but how do I suddenly have more Video Memory? I only have 256MB on that card
<Wrek> 05TheGreatAndPowerfulT: send 1 or 2 my way
<OtakuTom> Oh, I didn't notice that in the first image.
<Malmortius> The RAM fairty visited you
<Malmortius> fairy*
<Chrysalis> TheGreatAndPowerfulT send the rest my way
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek don't have one for myself, talking about what Malmortius said
<oni_link> OtakuTom: yeah that is what got my jimmes rustled
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Chrysalis same answer
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/5779026176
<oni_link> Malmortius: yay
<Malmortius> it aint any less plausible than god lolo
<Wrek> 05i only heard 3 girls
<Chrysalis> heres why desktops are awesom ehttp://theadmin.co.uk/img/ZldeWR.png
<OtakuTom> Either way, your card still meets requirements.
<Chrysalis> although, its reading my gpu mem wrong, i have more than that
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek [03:21] <Malmortius> i hate my life right now, sucks so bad. 3 girls wanna date me but i dont know which one to choose
<oni_link> OtakuTom: Yeah it does. but Im confused o.o
<OtakuTom> If I had the new laptop, I'd outperform that. I'll still outperform it once I get to my gaming desktop, Chrysalis :P
<oni_link> Chrysalis: I cant see it
<Chrysalis> OtakuTom youd outperform a 5.9ghz overclock
<Chrysalis> on a quadcore
<OtakuTom> I haven't overclocked, but I have a quadcore
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> OtakuTom i don't trust systemreq, everytime i run a scan it says that i'm using xp :p
<thegt90> id watch it http://cheezburger.com/6377433088
<OtakuTom> I wonder what it would say on this laptop (running Linux Mint)
<Chrysalis> also, i have decent cooling in my rig
<Chrysalis> youll never get that in a laptop
<Wrek> 05sweden: where most of the hardcore heavy metal bands are gay
<oni_link> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: That might explain why it says I have 869.5 MB when I have 256MB :D
<Wrek> 05xD
<oni_link> Wrek: lmao
<Chrysalis> it says i have 751 i have 2048
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wrek cani move to sweden ?
<oni_link> Chrysalis: is there a better site? hahaha
<OtakuTom> CPU power isn't everything, Chrysalis. I've got a cooling system in my desktop that would allow me to overclock my quadcore to 4.0 Ghz safely, but I just haven't done it.
<Chrysalis> though ram wise, it says i have 8.2gb somehow?
<Chrysalis> OtakuTom look at my gpu specs then
<Chrysalis> but realise its a 2gb card not a 768
<OtakuTom> Yea, I have a Nvidia GeForce GTX 670, what's the big deal?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oni_link the page gives you an idea but never trust it completly
<Chrysalis> you get those specs in a laptop they catch fire
<Chrysalis> or crash in under a minute due to overheating
<OtakuTom> Yea, which is exactly why the gaming rig I'm getting has exactly that...
<Chrysalis> though i should actually replace my cooling system
<oni_link> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: lmao yeah this isnt gonna be my primary pc anyways, im gonna be spending a cool $1200 for the tower
<Chrysalis> i cant actually play games with my cpu clocked like that
<Malmortius> No one streaming? :(
<killerpony7733> Malmortius: Wrek is streaming
<Malmortius> It says offline ;O
<oni_link> Malmortius: yeah wrek is
<oni_link> refresh?
<Malmortius> Wrek, you gonna play that dungeon game?
<OtakuTom> Laptops are more than able to do graphic-heavy applications now. Companies like Nvidia have developed mobile graphics processors and have been using them for years now. I've had no problems playing high-end games even on this laptop, with the only limiting factor being the other hardware.
<Malmortius> dungeons of...
<Malmortius> grimrock..?
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6375284992
<Malmortius> i think its called that
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Malmortius legend of grimrock
<Chrysalis> yeah but a) they run hot reducing the overall life of the chips
<Chrysalis> b) theyre still slower than the desktops and have to run at reduced settings
<oni_link> thegt90: this needs to happen
<thegt90> yes
<OtakuTom> Aw hell yea! Primo Victoria!
<Malmortius> My name is pinkie pie, and i am here to say! Im gonna make you cum all night, and i will make you gaaayyy!
<Malmortius> It doesnt matter now!
<Malmortius> If you are sad or blue
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i guess he left his computer unattended
*Chrysalis jumps
<oni_link> Malmortius: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/6212/
<OtakuTom> Chrysalis, I've been using this laptop for 3 years with no problems. It's just getting outdated. I've been able to play everything from Minecraft to Diablo III with no overheating and no slowdown aside from the limits of the older hardware.
<Chrysalis> at what settings
<Chrysalis> the one they come with
<Chrysalis> or can you turn em up
<OtakuTom> Again...this laptop is older now, so I had to use reduced settings. It only has 4 GB of RAM and and 4-year-old graphics processor. Plus, the display is only 1366x768. Once I get the new laptop, I'll be able to play at much higher settings at 1920x1080 with no problems, and I'm sure of it.
<Chrysalis> you know what, this is a redundant argument overall
<Chrysalis> pc > laptops > consoles > poo > mobiles
<Chrysalis> PC are still the master race
<Chrysalis> but laptops are better than any of the consoles
<OtakuTom> I wasn't trying to say that they weren't. I was just trying to point out that laptop's aren't bad (at least anymore)
<oni_link> Chrysalis: I think mobiles are better than poo and yes, PC is on top
<Pinkies4thWall|Sleep> Oh, yeah. FUN FACT: The MLP:FiM intro song is 95 syllables long.
<Chrysalis> and nintendo staying behind the times as usuall means the wiiu is only just catching up to 360/ps3
<Chrysalis> i miss the days when nintendo did stuff original
<OtakuTom> I still use my desktop almost exclusively at home unless I have company over.
*OtakuTom crosses fingers for 40:1
<oni_link> Chrysalis: yeah but theyve always been about software
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nintendo lost me the moment i saw the wii controler
<Chrysalis> oni_link which is just as unoriginal nowadays
<Chrysalis> mariokart 7
<Chrysalis> mario is getting old
<Chrysalis> and has never gotten any good
<Chrysalis> oooh fireworks
<oni_link> Chrysalis: Well yeah, nothing topped SM64 but idk Zelda is alright
<Chrysalis> euch, i dont like zelda
<OtakuTom> Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 were great. New Super Mario Bros was also a great return to 2D. The franchise that I think really has started to stagnate is Zelda (though I still really love the franchise)
<Chrysalis> its overrated though
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> mario is the next sonic bound to die slowly
<P4ngya> did he just..
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6363290880
<Chrysalis> P4ngya yes he did
<oni_link> Chrysalis: ... http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5806/
<P4ngya> rofl
<XylemTube> Hi! and whats this?
<Wrek> 05this is WCH currently showign Sabaton Live :3
<Chrysalis> oni_link no, i heard it was a really good game, and was severly dissapointed when i played it
<OtakuTom> They need to do something to breathe new life into the Mario franchise, I agree, but the games are still good. Mario and Zelda both transitioned into 3D well, and Nintendo really cared about the lives of both franchises. Sonic's first couple of 3D games were decent, but then Sega really dropped the ball, and that's really what led to Sonic's downfall.
<oni_link> OtakuTom: Skyward Sword was hit and miss. Im hoping the WiiU game will be good.
<oni_link> Chrysalis: Even the N64 games?
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6358152704
<oni_link> On a side note, if they had made sonic generations minus the "cutscenes and having his annoying friends (excluding tails), it would have been awesome/
<oni_link> i meant "cutscenes
<oni_link> damnit....
<Wrek> 05enjoy guys
<Wrek> 05its time for the heavy stuff
<oni_link> "cutscenes" there.
<OtakuTom> I actually haven't heard Therion yet...
<oni_link> Wrek: ooh what is this?
<P4ngya> nice set
*Chrysalis can't hold it
<Chrysalis> its too heavy
<Chrysalis> :P
<Malmortius> CAN YOU GUYS REMMEBER THE LYRICS to winter wrap up... HERE WE GO..
<Malmortius> Three months of winter coolness and awesome holidaaays!
<Chrysalis> Malmortius how about no
<Malmortius> SSHH
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6349886208
<oni_link> 60s Spiderman is best Rarity :D
<Malmortius> you guys are no fun
<Chrysalis> its spamming
<Wrek> 05we are jsut bored of every single time someone gotta bring up the WWU lyrics
<Malmortius> people do that alot?
<oni_link> ALOT
<Wrek> 05atleast once a day
<Wrek> 05guranteed
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also ay this time most people are sleep or awaking up
<thegt90> whats WWU
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> at*
<Chrysalis> inb4 he tries another song
<Wrek> 05winter wrap up
<oni_link> Winter Wrap Up thegt90
<thegt90> ah thank u
<oni_link> So how do you guys feel about Sonic 4?
<thegt90> i dont know many ibreviations or how to spell that word
<OtakuTom> I hated Sonic 4
<oni_link> OtakuTom: Just curious but why?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> haven't play it
<OtakuTom> I really would have rather it not be episodic, and have them focus on an actual linear game. I really didn't like the ability to select the stages individually.
<oni_link> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: They have demos, try for yourself. I'd like to hear how you feel about it.
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6349964800
<Wrek> 05hot opera chicsk 12 o'clock
<oni_link> OtakuTom: Well, it being episodic was kinda cheap but i think the stage select is being a bit nit picky isnt it?
<OtakuTom> I was excited to the return to 2D, but I just felt like they dropped the ball.
<Wrek> 05or if i am to be proper: 2 very fine ladies~
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehh i dunno the only sonic i really miss is sonic adventure 2 and that is for the chao garden
<oni_link> ^ ^ ^ ^
<OtakuTom> I don't really think I'm being nit-picky about it. If they had made it linear instead, they could have really focused on making early stages easier than later stages, forcing the player to improve over the course of the game.
*oni_link shares the same interests as Wrek
<oni_link> OtakuTom: Yeah, it was a bit easier than earlier games. Are you basing all of this off of Ep1, 2 or both though?
<OtakuTom> I didn't like 1, so I never got 2
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6340208896
<Malmortius> Wrek did you finish the robo rarity?
<Wrek> 05not yet
<oni_link> OtakuTom: I have yet to get 2, one wasn't bad IMO. A hell of a lot better than the 3D games. 06 left a bad taste in my mouth for all of eternity
<oni_link> thegt90: CANNOT BE UNSEEN D:
<thegt90> i know so want to find that book now
<oni_link> ^ ^ ^
<OtakuTom> 4 was really the nail in the coffin for me with Sonic. I really had high hopes for it, but I just plain didn't like it.
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6317276672
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6322845440
<Wrek> 05d'aaw
<oni_link> OtakuTom: Thats probably why I actually had fun with it then. I didn't have high hopes. I just wanted it to play good and it did. But they need work still. Far from perfect but not bad. I don't think I'll ever get another 3D Sonic game though. I heard great things about Colors but never got it because I was afraid it would suck. And Unleased drove me away with that fowl "werehog". *shivers*
<oni_link> Story is too thick too...
<Wrek> 05the one to the right
<Wrek> 05<3
<oni_link> Wrek: totally :3
<OtakuTom> Yea. The older games, such as Mario and Sonic, really are best with as little story as possible. They need to be just pointlessly fun and simple yet challenging platforming (or whatever genre it was originally made for :P)
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/5821911296
<Wrek> 05the original point of the story in both sonic and mario was to say "this isthe bad guy at the end"
<Wrek> 05when they derrived form that is where it went wrong
<Wrek> 05from*
<Wrek> 05and yeah
<OtakuTom> Exactly, Wrek. It just needs to be Mario vs. Bowser or Sonic vs. Robotnik. Nothing more.
<oni_link> OtakuTom: And that isnt so hard. Hi speed, platforming and little to no story. Just imply things, we dont need long, un inspired cutscenes and stories...
<Wrek> 05im totally having a crush on her to the right
<oni_link> Wrek: She is soo cute <3 and I totally agree. Bad guy is bad, good guy is good. Good stops bad. That way they have no reason but to focus on making it fun and challenging.
<oni_link> i didnt need that but there at the end. oh well...
<oni_link> actually it belongs there :D
<Wrek> 05where is sumica when you need him
<thegt90> http://cheezburger.com/6309625088
<killerpony7733> Wrek: Sleeping most likely?
<Wrek> 05he'd totally dig the brunette aswell :P
<oni_link> thegt90: dat logic

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ehhhh something about beiber being a brony
<Hrafn> well, he is a little girl, so technically he belongs to the target audience
<Underpony_> lawl that picture as fake
<Underpony_> *was
<Chrysalis> the whole bieber tweet is fake
<derpy_pony> hrafn...why so sexist?
<Hrafn> derpy_pony: I'm just kidding of course :)
<Hrafn> didn't mean to offend <3
<derpy_pony> teenage boys and their bieber...you talk about the guy all the time...

<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, can you type :kickbot 6 10
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i hope so ._. i just can't stand his fan base ._.
<Underpony> what is really going on then?
<derpy_pony> you are part of his fanbase
<derpy_pony> you spread the word whenever you can
<killerpony7733> I have one reason to hate him, And it has nothing to do with he is a person but rather the fact he hardly if not even makes good music
<derpy_pony> you wouldn't talk about ponies that much
<MaxTheBrony> Whom?
<MaxTheBrony> do you hate?
<derpy_pony> killerpony7733: is he your neighbour or something?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> derpy_pony to who are you talking to if it's okay to ask ?
<derpy_pony> no one in particular. except you :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> uhmmm you know sometimes this chat gets weird
<derpy_pony> when bieber becomes a brony, bronies aren't cool anymore and we go to another fanbase!
<killerpony7733> derpy_pony: Hah, Hardly i don't live in the US. I just don't like JB's music due extreme overuse of words over and over again more or less repeating them, Even worse he sings about teen love which is to say never good
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> derpy_pony never said that
<Thrackerzod> hai everyone
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, Ping

<derpy_pony> good night, TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
<MaxTheBrony> Sleep well
<Hrafn> sleep well TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Very_Silly_Filly> Then I just so happened to of found a pair of gunboats, so Iput them on and rocketjumped to the exit
<Very_Silly_Filly> I went down the elevator and woke up :3
<derpy_pony> I want portal dreams too
<Very_Silly_Filly> Mine was portal: My way
<Hrafn> I had a TF2 related dream a while back :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> I do get the most retarded dreams in the world
<Very_Silly_Filly> But that's only because how screwed up my life is :)
<Underpony> I get the most retarded dreams
<alexxm> what do you mean Underpony
<Hrafn> I was back at my old school, and my boyfriend was there for some reason, and he let me stab him so I could disguise as his team, it was all kinds of messed up
<Underpony> you don't even want to know about my dreams XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have roughly 2 dreams a week
<Very_Silly_Filly> So I probably won't get any more this week, since I had one on Monday
<Thrackerzod> I have a dream every day
<Hrafn> actually, I've read that everyone dreams several times a night, you just don't remember most dreams :3
<Thrackerzod> Hrafn yup excepted i remeber all of them
<Very_Silly_Filly> I had one about a zombie apocolypse last week
<derpy_pony> true ladies have no last name ^^
<Underpony> I haven't dreamt in ages until last night
<Very_Silly_Filly> Pretty much went on the roof and sniped zombies with the one shot one kill sniper rifle
<Hrafn> I've had tons of zombie dreams... probably due to my extreme interest in horror movies and whatnot :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> Then it started to sleet, and I slipped off, fell down and woke up.
<Thrackerzod> this week 50% pony 20% zombie 30% random 20% cool
<Very_Silly_Filly> I presume I woke up because I was killed
<ekips> that's more than 100% Thrackerzod O.o
<Very_Silly_Filly> Which actually would of been the first fatality in a while
<derpy_pony> I never dreamed of ponies. It would probably take several hours of massive pony exposure to get such dreams...
<Thrackerzod> ekyps how much more :P
<derpy_pony> don't know if it's worth it
<Hrafn> I've never dreamt of ponies either that I can remember, which is actually a bit odd
<ninja> wtf is thi
<Very_Silly_Filly> I don't think I had a death until last week since ages ago when I was testing my new weapon which at that point, I hadn't invented
<derpy_pony> wacken, ninja
<Very_Silly_Filly> I accidently shot and blew up the building near me
<Very_Silly_Filly> was walking away, and it suddenly ended
<Very_Silly_Filly> I *presume* I was hit be debris
<ninja> derpy_pony: an awesome band or something
<Underpony> what are the NSFW rules here?
<Very_Silly_Filly> This site is 13+

<Underpony> that would have been funny
<Corrupt> but it happens at least once a week
<alexxm> Corrupt well at least you have dinner now
<Corrupt> any idea why they keep doing that
<JRP2234[Web]> Zelda
<Underpony> nope
<alexxm> they probably don't understand how windows work Corrupt dont think the window will stop them
<Underpony> but I always thought it would be funny if like, a pigeon flew head-first into a window died
<Corrupt> but the shades are down as far as they are concerned it's a wall
<Corrupt> idk what the deal is but they have already cracked the glass
<MadSurge> Ohai Bronystate! Different computer, and Steam games work! :$

<AdamTheDuck> Can't tell if chat is ded or my internet just ded.
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, ded chat
<TheRandomkid321> Holy crap mates. I just saw a guy pretending to be mickey mouse on a TF2 server.
<TheRandomkid321> Wow... CHat sure is dead Phase
<JRP2234[Web]> Phase4: cartridge crashed
<AdamTheDuck> So no stream going on?
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234[Web], kinda distracted
<TheRandomkid321> And I'm guessing lack of chatting = lack of dtream
<JRP2234[Web]> IT TOOK A DUMP
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut?
<alexxm> who had a shit
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, ping
<MaxTheBrony> D:
<JRP2234[Web]> my zelda cartridge crashed while i was streaming
<TheRandomkid321> Well this is... fun... yay...
<AdamTheDuck> Ever get Fallout to... well... not crash Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, not yet
<AdamTheDuck> That's a pitty
<Phase4> 00,02i think new vegas might work
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah but New Vegas didn't have the epic moments and story like Fallout 3...
<d3rb> hello dead chat
<Underpony> hi
<Corrupt> New Vegas ending was epic
<BronyJemkins> Hey there d3rb. ._
<d3rb> Corrupt, as good as fallout 3 ending?
<AdamTheDuck> Corrupt: Then you haven't tried Fallout 3 then...
<Corrupt> yes
<Corrupt> I beat them both
<d3rb> thats a big call but i might have to buy it and find out
<AdamTheDuck> Was it that good? I thought it was too simple.
<Corrupt> Fallout 3 had a epic ending too, just a different kind
<BronyJenkins> Never played them myself.
<d3rb> BronyJenkins, do yourself a favour, get fallout 3
<Corrupt> In NV I love how all the factions you get on your side come to help you at the end
<BronyJenkins> Will do in future. :/
<d3rb> its pretty good, i doubt youll regret it
<AdamTheDuck> As long as it doesn't crash as much as it did with Phase xD
<d3rb> lol yeah, maybe get the physical copy, i never had a problem with mine
<BronyJenkins> Mkay, no money at the mo, but I'll bear it in mind. :3
<TheRandomkid321> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaqRwFyoGgQ&feature=plcp DO YOU!?
<BronyJenkins> Yes.
<d3rb> i'm sceptical
<BronyJenkins> prince-dari
<Thrackerzod> d3rb good not everone should
<Corrupt> I'm going to have to reinstall Fo3
<TheRandomkid321> I play consoles... :/
<AdamTheDuck> TheRandomkid321: No mods for you :/
<d3rb> i've already played it through 3 times but i wanna play it again after thinking about it
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck I cant install em anyways.
<Corrupt> I overdid the mods for fallout 3
<AdamTheDuck> Corrupt: Lol who didn;t?
*d3rb has never modded fallout 3 and plays it on pc...
<d3rb> the shame!
<Underpony> haha, modding
<Corrupt> For NV I got more perks and perks every level best thing I ever did
<d3rb> wouldnt that just make the game super easy Corrupt ?
<Underpony> ^
<Thrackerzod> not if you a good modder
<Thrackerzod> <----
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah, I just install the realism mods
<Corrupt> a little but a lot of the perks don't do too much
<d3rb> so you can counter the mods by making it harder?
<Corrupt> I always beat the game before I go mod crazy
<d3rb> ah good
<Thrackerzod> Corrupt likewise
<AdamTheDuck> No. 1 rule, beat game on vanilla or get bored of vanilla before attempting to mod...
<d3rb> so its just screwing around and having a bit of fun with it
<Corrupt> yep
<AdamTheDuck> Pretty much
<Thrackerzod> poni poni?
<d3rb> pudi pudi?
<Corrupt> I have been trying to get one of the mods that let you put your own songs into the radio to work but I can't get it to work
<Thrackerzod> corrupt thats easy
<d3rb> i would have thought that would be one of the easier things to do
<Corrupt> My brain just messes up on one part
<Thrackerzod> there's litteraly the radio mp3 file that you can find lol
<Corrupt> link?
<TheRandomkid321> AFTER A WEEK OF SEARCHING I HAVE FOUND IT AGAIN! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AACPUsgO_e0

<Chrysalis> mr ill
<Chrysalis> man a man
<Chrysalis> out of you!
<Chrysalis> make*
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02i've now crashed linux
<Chrysalis> easier than people make it sound
<Phase4> 00,02how hard can it be to partition a usb
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, it realy isnt
<AdamTheDuck> So... we get to watch you play Zork?
<Chrysalis> your trying to partition a USb
<Chrysalis> are you crazy?
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, ikr
<Phase4> 00,02who wants to do that
<MaidWhite> Explode it?
<Chrysalis> though i did it for my xbox
<dalekkahn> Explode it twice?
<Chrysalis> fat music stor and an ntfs main store
<Phase4> 00,02i did it to install ubuntu
<Phase4> 00,02ntfs is a bad idea for solid state
<Chrysalis> external hdd
<Phase4> 00,02but yeah
<Phase4> 00,02the guest modules caused a kernel panic
<Phase4> 00,02um
<AdamTheDuck> Use more duct tape?
<Phase4> 00,02actually i think virtualbox crashed
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Chrysalis> it would be faster to upload to a remote host and download it
<Phase4> 00,02i crashed virtualbox
<Chrysalis> that go through all this
*Liokin has all the strength of the raging fire
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, i need to wipe the partition table
<Phase4> 00,02it'd be quicker to reboot to linux
<killerpony7733> Liokin: It's funny how it's actually true :D
<Liokin> -lol
<Phase4> 00,02wat

<Saturn> 08,01so i was visiting my parents
<AdamTheDuck> ohai Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01and my mother insisted on making me lunch
<Saturn> 08,01she asked what i would like to drink
<Underpony> Apple juice!
<twilight_sprinkle> AdamTheDuck: its the theme song of the sherlock holmes movies
<AdamTheDuck> Apple cider?
<Saturn> 08,01and i've been in an exceptionally silly mood all morning
<Saturn> 08,01so i almost shouted out "PENIS!"
<Phase4> 00,02lets have another go at fallout 3
<AdamTheDuck> *yay*
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, what did you shout instead?
<XAX> Saturn: Were you around people?
<Saturn> 08,01as some of you might know, my mother is a very conservative little old woman, who was brought up in india
<AdamTheDuck> Lol and thought the mods were mature adults xD
*XAX reads up chat
<XAX> Oh
<XAX> Never mind :|
<Saturn> 08,01shouting this out would not have gone down well
<AdamTheDuck> I though*
<Saturn> 08,01so i shouted out "MOTHBALLS!" instead
<Saturn> 08,01was still not amused
<XAX> mothballs
<Saturn> 08,01but at least it wasn't penis.
<XAX> ._.
<AdamTheDuck> o.o
<AdamTheDuck> Doesn't feel the same...
<AdamTheDuck> Mothballs...

<Liokin> EggWhite: Advertising
<XAX> EggWhite: I love the way you worded that.
<MadSurge> Nephy: Welcome to the stream :D
<Olol> I'm sorry. I just wondered if you would want tot make someone who's sorta half dying a bit happy... I thought the Brony community would have a heart for that (Seeing as they've been kind to me in the past...
<Spectrum_Rush|Sleepy> EggWhite: are you Data
<EggWhite> Oh ok danke Liokin
<Nephy> Thank you :D

<Liokin> Nephy: Double click the persons name from the names on the list to the right of the chat.
<XAX> Nephy: That list of people on the right. Double click a name to open a PM box.
<EggWhite> Spectrum_Rush|Sleepy: No misa is is HK-47 from KOTOR

<XAX> DAMNIT Liokin.
<Nephy> Nice!

<twilight_sprinkle> Olol: you cant afford minecraft yourself? surely you can afford 27$ for a dying friend
<Liokin> Olol: You want minecraft for your friend so bad? Pirate it
<Olol> I have barely any money...
<Liokin> Olol: Or download it fro youtube
<Nephy> Thank you all for being so kind. :D
<Liokin> Olol: Its just that simple
<XAX> lol download it from YouTube
<Spectrum_Rush|Sleepy> when did minecraft become $27?
<Liokin> XAX: Yeah >:3
<MegaMoonShine> Can you really do that?
<killerpony7733> Olol: I had a self updating pirated copy once so get that if you can't afford it
<allponiesarebestponi> Olol: get it on xbox or something
<Liokin> MegaMoonShine: Yes! -lol
<allponiesarebestponi> it only 20$
<XAX> Because every FREE 100% DOWNLOAD video on YouTube is legitimate.
<AttacktheAndalite> Wait, you can download Minecraft from YouTube? Whut? That seems impossible.
<BaconMane> 0,5Olol, truthful or not, it's simply against our rules to advertise it here. If I had a bacon strip for every time someone wanted to spam or advertise here I'd have a truckload of bacon.
<killerpony7733> ^Pretty much
<Olol> I don't want to do anything illegal
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: I did it! >:3
<Hat> Bacon please
<Underpony> Olol: I don't know who you are, I don't know what you want. If you're looking for money, I can tell you that I don't have any. But what I do have is a very particular set of skills. Skills I have aqcuired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you don't link that again, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not persue you. But if you do, I will look for you, I will find you, a
<Underpony> nd I will tell on you.
<XAX> Olol: We realized. But read what BaconMane just said.
<AttacktheAndalite> BaconMane: You forgot those that come in trying to "troll" us
<killerpony7733> Olol: Well it's your call, Just saying that it's possible to get
<twilight_sprinkle> Spectrum_Rush|Sleepy dunno i just looked at the official page
<XAX> Underpony: I laughed.
<alexxm> seems legit
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Whuuuu?
<killerpony7733> Underpony: Dat reference
<allponiesarebestponi> Unerpony: lol
<Liokin> XAX: Thats true. Not everyone has a legit download. But if you want it bad enough you'll find it -lol
<MegaMoonShine> Underpony: Dat wall of text
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: I can link you to a legit download of a copy if you want it.
<Underpony> :3
<MegaMoonShine> What movie is that even from? :S
<XAX> Liokin: ...it is true that i have found some helpful shit on YouTube.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hey everypony, managed to cut myself on a latch :/
<Olol> But what I don't understand is how it's advertising?
<allponiesarebestponi> MegaMoonShine: Taken
<MegaMoonShine> Hey Very_Silly_Filly :)
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: PM me. I don't have to pay for it once I launch it, do I?
<Spectrum_Rush|Sleepy> twilight_sprinkle: eh me no care really since i already have it 6_9
<Liokin> XAX: So you kinow how easy it is to get something if you REALLY want it.
<alexxm> how'd that happen Very_Silly_Filly
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Not a cent
<Hat> Sorry Very_Silly_Filly
<Liokin> AttacktheAndalite: Gimme one sec to find the video again.
<allponiesarebestponi> Olol: if it is asking for money its advertising
<Nephy> Hmm...
<killerpony7733> Olol: You were asking for money to get minecraft or someone to buy it for you correct?
<AttacktheAndalite> I remember one time my friend from Maine texted me at like 7 in the morning just to tell me that he had Minecraft. I was like "Dude, are you fucking serious?"
<EggWhite> If BaconMane got a bacon strip for the people that have came on here in an attempt to troll, would it be a planet of bacon?
<AttacktheAndalite> Liokin: Mmmm
<Very_Silly_Filly> alexxm: I was trying to take off one of the top parts of a gun, and it was wedged
<AttacktheAndalite> EggWhite: More like a small galaxy
<Very_Silly_Filly> So I used a knife to get it off and slit myself with it
<alexxm> EggWhite we don't get that many trolls do w
<Olol> It's not money.. It gives me a point everytime the link is clicked, I'm on 3 points right now, and a minecraft code is 6 points

<XAX> I would go and grill some bacon. If it weren't 3am.
<XAX> And I weren't in bed.
<AttacktheAndalite> You guys keep me from getting irritated early in the morning. I love you guuuuuuyysss *hugs the chat*

<Liokin> thats about it
<RaveBrony> Ah, ok.
<RaveBrony> No special classes or anything?
<Liokin> IDK about that

<Kandarihu> Oh, I see. It says, Please enter a new tag that is at most most 4 characters.
<Zanon> not me caumen
<RaveBrony> Ah :P
<Kandarihu> But it seems to have no problem letting me enter in Bronystate.
<Kandarihu> It also doesn't get in the way of me making BrSt
<RaveBrony> See a tree, go right through it! :D
<Zanon> he will be doing some artwork for my oc soon

<Bronysith> skyrim is fun but i need to play more deus ex 1
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: ah good, i hate zombie burials :I youd think theyd burn corpses instead of giving them the chance to become zombies
<Very_Silly_Filly> I always remember that name as deu sex
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: where did you find most of them? underground or outside?
<Bronysith> I am still waiting for the amazing RPG. i want it where you can make your own backstory for your character

<cachi01|phone> So you guys already played lollipop chainsaw?
<alexxm> twilight_sprinkle i think most of the zombies were people who were chosen to guard the tombs and i found the words by shouting in areas in the game wait about a ingame day and a courier will send you a letter about a dragon shout location
<Dumori> NO one is really willing to read a setting primer b4 playing a game
<GarrettBrony> nope

<XylemTube> Arn?
<ShadowStep> Yeah but dont they usually have like a main force leading them like the french or english? Dermathil
<Dermathil> ShadowStep: I don't know which it is
<Wrek> 05last grand master was english
<Dermathil> Most likely english
<Wrek> 05the current one i think was french
<ShadowStep> ehhh doesnt matter :) good viewin
<Jim> it's called Arn  The Kingdom at Road's End, I believe
<Ryunosuke> thats why they lost wrek... the frinch only won against one other people, and that was the french :)
<shaggypenguin> ok i have learned something new
<Jim> that's a good thing
<Dark_Horst> poisoned
<shaggypenguin> alright so tommorow is the day when they show pony episodes correct?
<Dark_Horst> i'm calling it
<Michael> shaggypenguin: yed
<Barbetos|AtWork> shaggypenguin in between movies yes.
<Michael> *yes
<Fisheh_Fish> It's at 7pm right?
<shaggypenguin> alright sounds good
<Barbetos|AtWork> 7pm eastern, yes
<Fisheh_Fish> Cool. EST for the win
<shaggypenguin> i just look at the timer thing
<Imperios> Hello people
<Dermathil> yes, 7PM EST
<shaggypenguin> it tells you when
<Jim> hi Imperios
<shaggypenguin> kinda
<Imperios> I consider making a pony OC
<Fisheh_Fish> Hey ya Imperios
<Imperios> I wonder
<Michael> howdy Imperios
<Dark_Horst> so many douchebags
<Imperios> Should a pony engineer be a unicorn or an earth pony?
<Dermathil> So, have other people seen the latest Planetside 2 trailer? (Death is No Excuse)
<Barbetos|AtWork> He went to go get his nunchukus
<ShadowStep> Uhh earth Imperios
<Dark_Horst> Imperios: earth ponies. unicorns are better for artsy things
<Dark_Horst> Imperios: or science
<SirGanjalf> Imperios: Earth cause AJ
<Fisheh_Fish> Pegasi are better for bad assery
<shaggypenguin> a real quick shout out for sea ponies lol
<Imperios> I have designed him
<Ryunosuke> backstory: Saladin and Arn are... .rivals, not really mortal enemies, but closer to friends
<Barbetos|AtWork> Lets not forget: Griffons can do it all, probably better.
<shaggypenguin> i dont like griffons anymore
<Imperios> He's a muted brown tall but skinny male pony with a tophat with engines in it
<Ryunosuke> oh shit son
<shaggypenguin> the whole fluttershy thing
<SirGanjalf> Ryunosuke: Was Arn a historical figure?
<shaggypenguin> and making her cry
<Imperios> And probably a gear cutiemark
<Jim> He is fictional I believe
<Jim> But his environment was factual
<SirGanjalf> Guy looks like a Jesus....
<Imperios> Can he use mechanical steam-punkish wings for locomotion?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Don't hate the griffons just becuase of Gilda. She is only one sentient being after all.
<Ryunosuke> it was stated in the last movie
<Emocakes> Is that jesus?...
<Michael> true
<Michael> hate produces more hate
<XylemTube> looks an awful lot like jesus
<SirGanjalf> Emocakes: He sure looks like him
<Fisheh_Fish> ^
<Ryunosuke> thats what I thought too
<Dermathil> Imperios: I wouldn't recommend pushing it too far with the unique little snowflake stuff. Otherwise your stuff will end up being as fun as a black and red alicorn OC.
<Imperios> Would a pony with mechanical wings be stupid?
<Barbetos|AtWork> GOLD
<Dark_Horst> monez
<shaggypenguin> ok ill give them a chance but gilda better stay out
<RaveBrony> Well damn
<Imperios> What do you mean by unique snowflake
<SirGanjalf> Imperios: Not, it would be awesome:)
<RaveBrony> :)
<shaggypenguin> jesus be takin bribes sence 1ad
<SirGanjalf> *no

<Emocakes> I lost 7 bits
<kirzstryfe> 8,6my bet is on a movie to coincide with the 30th anniversary
<Thrackerzod> what wrek isnt telling you is twilight has been translating the inter time
<SaxyPretender> 0,14maybe not faster, but it can give 'em more time to plan what direction to take for the future
<Shooeie> I bet u they die of starvation
<mishia> WINNERS! TIME FOR FAMILY REGROUPING!!!
<Mekapix2> wait, who bet hed liive?
<Shooeie> no one
<ShadowStep> no one XD
<kirzstryfe> 8,6I'd rather see the show end before it jumps the shark
<FouLou> damn lost 10 bits
<Thrackerzod> mishia need more death pony, death pony of freindship
<Mekapix2> lol then we keep our bits
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is not going to be the last season that's for sure

<FouLou> were so bad
<Wrek> 05hollywood have spoiled you all
<RoboGerbil> well if it goes to half the episodes, maybe it will be twice as long episodes?
<FouLou> Dark_Horst: that doesnt count
<Dark_Horst> i'm still rigth B)

<Dark_Horst> oh shit, he died
<Alchemist> hes just tired
<ShadowStep> okay so he does die
<Meanwhile> Awww what.
<Meanwhile> He was back home for fucks sake.
<mishia> Thrackerzod: yeah death ponies of friendship are important!

<Emocakes> now he ded? do i get my 7 bits back?
<Mekapix2> well he sure can drag it out cant he
<Wrek> 05but it probably got infectedin the cold
<cachi01> lol final fantasy XXVII
<Mekapix2> nvm
<SaxyPretender> 0,14might be harder to write for as well
<Wrek> 05and in the end took his life
<mishia> Wrek: medince that isnt' just brews they THINK solve problems. or soultions like blood/fluid draining
<Dark_Horst> at least the kind of medicine that doesnt involve old men with beards dancing around you waving dead chickens
<Wrek> 05for him to die in his wifes arms
<SaxyPretender> 0,14big difference between a 1 hour show and a 30 minute show
<ShadowStep> Well everyone won the bet :D
<FouLou> Except Dark_Horst
<RoboGerbil> yeh but all the popular eps are the 2 parters
<mishia> theres like no dialouge, and yet i feel sad
<Mekapix2> can you cure a sword to the stomach with medicine?
<ShadowStep> ooooooooooo
<mishia> *SNIFFFFFF*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you'd have to change around pacing, and that probably would mess with the formula we've enjoyed
<Dark_Horst> FouLou: actually, he survived the battle
<Bronysith> Mekapix2: medi gun
<mishia> Thrackerzod: are you laughing...?
<Dark_Horst> even made it home
<Bronysith> Wrek: it sucks they dont have the medi gun
<Wrek> 05Mekapix2: aye. needle and thread to seal the wound. and desinfectant to keep it clean
<Emocakes> *sniff* im not crying....:'(
<FouLou> Dark_Horst: he actually didnt. He may not fell in it but got mortaly wounded.
<crazypony> :'(
<Mekapix2> ok but he did keep it hidden, kind of his own fault really
<ShadowStep> we are gathered here dearly beloved...
<Dark_Horst> fun thing is, the romans already had invasive surgery
<Dark_Horst> but it got lost with the fall of the empire
<Wrek> 05that ivory cross adn his swords he has carried with him since he first left the monastery many years ago
<Meanwhile> Inb4 it ends faster than we hoped it would.
<Wrek> 05they followed him into the end
<Bronysith> damn
<ShadowStep> to bear witness to what happens when many people make a bet that
<mishia> Mekapix2: they have no disinfectint. in fact, most people die in thouse times from an infection due to the medical equiment's qaulity
<Bronysith> Hi dont understand anything. but it is so good
<SaxyPretender> 0,14;__;

<Wrek> 05Hope you enjoyed the second and final part (so far) in this movie series. even if the subs failed half way, most of the scenes were barely easy to understand
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> they are probably aiming for the movie anyway
*AttacktheAndalite applauds Wrek
<Emocakes> Thank you Wrek
<mishia> Mekapix2: though around thouse times people were realizing if they took alittle of a virus*or somthing it produces, like a fluid/scab, and snort/ingest a small amount of it, they can get a lighter verison of the sickness and began to work up an immunity

<sagas> This is a bit of an extreme response
<Sumica> 00,10no RAWRity

<StinkomanFan> ALL THE GASLINES
<Sumica> 00,10still expecting there to be 26 with the other 13 being done by studio B
<RAWRity> Sumica: Top Draw said they were making 13 eps, that didn't mean s3 was only going to be that.
<otakon> Sumica: wait...Studio B isn't doing them?
<Ryunosuke> micheal bay folks
<RaveBrony> ^
<AttacktheAndalite> StinkomanFan: ALL the gaslines?

<Barbetos> Soooooo... An explosion near a car does not blow it up?
<RaveBrony> Does it really matter how many episodes there are?? Bronies will MAKE the episodes Thmeselves if theres only 13!!! :D
<AttacktheAndalite> Barbetos: Hollywood logic
<otakon> GOD DAMN IT ALL TO BUCKING TARTARUS!
<Barbetos> If that car was empty or had bad guys in it I am sure it would of blown then.
<AttacktheAndalite> See?
<cachi01> RaveBrony: its true
<Meanwhile> Heeheehee
<Petrified_Discord> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4032/
<cachi01> lol
<RAWRity> Barbetos: seeing as it was Meghan McCarthy, the show runner of S3, who said it...I'd say it's more or less confirmed.
<Sumica> 00,10wrek are you on 5 in 10 again?
<otakon> RaveBrony: that is not the problem, the problem is that Studio B is not doing all of them.
<RAWRity> Unless Hasbro's working on a 2nd set of episode that nobody knows about.
<GarrettBrony> Star Wrek 12 the P files
<otakon> Sumica: it says he's 6/10
<Sumica> 00,10the text says what ever we tell it to say
<RaveBrony> otakon: Oh, i see
<RAWRity> otakon: have you seen the animation for the released songs? Looks pretty good to me.
<Shooeie> Luna is still asleep in the corner
<AttacktheAndalite> otakon, the script loves you extra today
<Emocakes> ~yay~~
<Barbetos> RAWRity how much does Meghan really know though? Nothings official untill it comes from the company footing the bill imo.
<otakon> RAWRity: it's not all Studio B though
<cachi01> text i command you to say hi
<ShadowStep> KID getting my ass kicked is part of my job, LET ME DO IT
<cachi01> text: fuck you

<GarrettBrony> Star Wrek 13 rise of the Simple machines
<RaveBrony> Fuuuuuuuuuu
<RAWRity> Barbetos: Again, seeing as she's the one in charge of MAKING the episodes, she has a pretty good idea.
<RustyMeat> uh oh
<Ryunosuke> ALL THE POWER
<JESmith71> Well if it is true wouldn't McCarthy still write them all? I mean it would still have the same VAs anyways right?
<RustyMeat> her daughter
<otakon> yh
<JESmith71> Or still be the show runner. Not write them all. My mistake
<otakon> anyway brb need some drinkage
<RustyMeat> lol warlock
<cachi01> season 3 is supposed to be more brony oriented right?
<Wrek> 05a new hope
<RaveBrony> Y u no go see Shaman?
<RAWRity> otakon: except one thing: The WRITERS are the same. It's a different animation studio.
<RAWRity> cachi01: no idea.
<Thrackerzod> gigity
<otakon> RAWRity: nope still don't trust them.
<Wrek> 05inb4 animation quality is noticably different

<cachi01> well there are some leaked season 3 songs
<Wrek> 05we say fuck no
<RAWRity> otakon: you want to see if the animation's different? There have been TWO songs released with animation by the new studio. Go look it up.
<cachi01> and the animation is the same
<Ryunosuke> better than CoD flying
<Fou_Lou> otakon: just wait and judge them when they are out
<Ryunosuke> at least they got off the ground :)
<Obsidian> Ill wait and see
<cachi01> RAWRity: they look the same for me
<RAWRity> cachi01: exactly.
<Sumica> 00,10of corse the animation is the same it's all software
<sagas> Does he have his own generator?
<ZappyTheUnicorn> I gotta go. G'night everypony.
<Fou_Lou> RAWRity: isnt the animation studio in charge of the backrgounds too? I mean BG pony placements and stuff
<JESmith71> So it wasn't Studio B that did the animation for those? It was another studio?
<cachi01> what if MLP was animated by pixar
<sagas> Heas getting past you because he has access to ALL ELECTRONICS!
<AttacktheAndalite> Night, ZappyTheUnicorn
<RAWRity> Fou_Lou: yes, but seeing as Derpy was a scripted BG character, I don't imagine she'll disappear.
