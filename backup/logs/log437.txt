<Mutterguy_> no was wondering about the Starwars song by weird Al
*Rain curls up infront of the fireplace with Shizuka and pulls a blanket over her
*Rain drifts off to sleep
<BarneyAndPonies> whelp, it's been a time and a half, 'night all
<BronyJenkins> *Tumbleweed*
<iLoveSpike> test
<iLoveSpike> does this work?
<Shane377> No Strea,?
<Shane377> stream*
<Rain-in-a-bottle> no, the mods are sleepy.
<iLoveSpike> can you people see this?
<Rain-in-a-bottle> yes, iLoveSpike
<iLoveSpike> wooo
<iLoveSpike> so i was thinking today...
*Rain-in-a-bottle goes back to the fireplace and curls up with Shizuka again, muttering something about being woken up by tests
<iLoveSpike> I'd like to see Spike masturbate his cute little dragon penis until its dripping wet with precum, and then have him stick it inside of Big Macintosh's penis sheath and jack off feverously until he fills up Big Mac's cock pouch like a twinkie. Spike could pull out and watch Big Macintosh become erect as his growing member glistens with Spike's warm sperm. Spike could then jack off Big
<iLoveSpike> Macintosh fast with both hands until Big Mac sprays Spike's face and body down with cum, it would be like a semen fire hose.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dafuq?
<XAX> That wall
<XAX> I recognize it
<XAX> Same person came here a few days ago, and said exactly that :l
<Spell-of-Gaming> That's inappropriate
<Spell-of-Gaming> :I
<iLoveSpike> can you imagine if Big Macintosh blew his load onto Spike, especially if he saved it up for a few days?
<Rain> yeah, and got banned I think
<XAX> I know :(
<iLoveSpike> Spike would be drowning in sperm
<XAX> Slurreh banned him
<iLoveSpike> its probably not the exact same paragraph, i rewrote it an hour ago :)
<XAX> ._.
<iLoveSpike> and i added the part about the semen fire hose
*Rain calls in the hit squad
<XAX> And im sure you had so much fun
<XAX> HELLO GHOSTIES
<iLoveSpike> oh i did
<XAX> How art thou?
<Ghosties> 04Thou art tired
<Emerald_Chocolate> Hellow!
<XAX> :(
<Ghosties> 04Thou is also apparently the only mod on at this hour
<Emerald_Chocolate> Ghosties!
*XAX needs to l2stream
<MaidSurge> Hey Ghosties!
<Ghosties> 04Yo
<iLoveSpike> do you prefer Spike having 1 or 2 penises?
<iLoveSpike> I think he looks cuter with just 1
<XAX> What the fuq
<XAX> I don't even
<Monfang_> Why would he have two anyway?
<Monfang_> I never understood that.
<MaidSurge> Monfang_: some lizards do have two.
<Monfang_> Why?
<Emerald_Chocolate> Ghosties, I haven't seen you for a while.
<Monfang_> Meh, doesn't matter.
<MaidSurge> Monfang_: ask that to evolution, I guess
<iLoveSpike> http://tinyurl.com/79lbf8f
<Spell-of-Gaming> OH GOD
<Spell-of-Gaming> WHY DID I CLICK THAT LINK
<XAX> I don't even want to click that
<Spell-of-Gaming> WHHHYY
<XAX> Knowing what he has been pasting
<Ghosties> 04People please don't click the links
<Emerald_Chocolate> Ghosties, couldn't you ban him?
<XAX> iLoveSpike was kicked from the room by Ghosties. (GOODSIR, I SAY GOOD DAY TO YOU)
<Rain> he just did >_>
<Emerald_Chocolate> Okay, but I mean "ban ban".
<Rain> He /did/
<MaidSurge> HAHAHAHAHAHA I've seen worse. No really, I've seen worse.
<XAX> He did
<Rain> [04:17:49] * Ghosties sets mode: +b *!*@75.10.vgj.nxv
<XAX> ^ that
<Ghosties> 04inb4 he ban evades
<Ghosties> 04Again
<Rain> lol
<Rain> if he does
<XAX> That would be just saaaaad
<Rain> call on MakerDusk to k-line 'em
<Emerald_Chocolate> Okay. Well, who's going to watch season 3, when it comes out..? I know I sure am.
<Rain> I might not
*Rain shrugs
<Emerald_Chocolate> Why Rain?
<MaidSurge> Who won't?
<XAX> I'm going to watch Dan vs. in the MLP off-season.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Depends on my schedule.
<Rain> because I am slowly loosing intrest in the show
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have school when Season 3 comes out.
<Emerald_Chocolate> Yeah, sometimes life is just hard..
<Ghosties> 04Wow
<Ghosties> 04It's weird being in the chat at this hour
<BronyinJapan> wft?
<Emerald_Chocolate> I just finished my homework, due tomorrow.

<Rain> ^
<Emerald_Chocolate> Mmhhmm
<XAX> It has been like this a few nights in a row
<Ghosties> 04Well, fortunately, this is how things typically are when it comes to mods and shifts
<Rain> because the season ended (thank god)
<Ghosties> 04For all this summer I'll be up until like 7 AM in the morning, at least until another mods comes on
<Emerald_Chocolate> Yeah, atleast we won't have as many people as we did when the Canterlot Wedding was on.

<XAX> Oh mai
<Ghosties> 04So while 5K is a bit too idealistic at this time, I don't think it'd be too much of a dream to hope for
<XAX> Well done :D
<Mutterguy_> Brony State ish best Streamer
<Emerald_Chocolate> Man, I loved the songs.

<Shane377> Ghosties: i heard after the stream in the early days the mods would go into a free for all kick all the other mods off to be the last one in the chat
<Starflash> >Ghosties talks >all the lurkers start talking.

<Ghosties> 04Mhm
<Ghosties> 04That's true, Shane

<Emerald_Chocolate> Female bronies of course.
<Rain> NO
<Rain> that is not cool
<Ghosties> 04Huh, interesting
<Emerald_Chocolate> I'm a female.
*Mutterguy_ winced at that
<Rain> as am I
<Ghosties> 04Don't think I'll sit through the whole thing
<Shane377> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4826/
<Ghosties> 04But I'll definitely keep it in mind
<Shane377> Ghosties: lol my link or XAX s?
<Rain> I find it stupid to give different names based on gende
<Rain> r
<Rain> it makes the fandom look like two different parts
<XAX> Shane377: BronyinJapan's :p
<Rain> which it's not
<BronyinJapan> Shane377 Mine
<Shane377> XAX: ahh k
<Shane377> Ghosties: did u see my link
<XAX> >__>
<Ghosties> 04I saw both links but typed it in myself
<Emerald_Chocolate> Anywho, Rain, what has your favourite part of MlP FIM been?
<Rain> hmm
<BronyinJapan> LOL wtf is with that Nigel meme, its sooo funny :D
<Rain> I was going to say the community, but that has started to fade for me
<Ghosties> 04Oh yeah, some female fans call themselves 'pegasisters'
<Rain> ewwwwww
<XAX> Das silly
<Ghosties> 04Nothing wrong with that in my mind
<Shane377> Ghosties: yea same
<Emerald_Chocolate> Just a name.
<Rain> I know, but it just makes it look like a different fandom
<Shane377> haha i kno BronyinJapan
<Shane377> BronyinJapan: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwRbOm2Pvg
*Rain is all about equallity of the sexes
<Emerald_Chocolate> Pegasi, Unicorns, Earth ponies, Princess Celestias twins, what else is new?
<Rain> as in, giving a different name just because of gender just doesnt sit right with me :\
<Rain> besides, Im pretty bro :p
<Emerald_Chocolate> As am I.
*XAX read that as "I'm pretty, bro"
<XAX> :(
<Rain> lol
<Rain> Im not a narsacist
<Rain> :p
<Emerald_Chocolate> Look rain,Males should have a males name, and Females should have a females name
<Emerald_Chocolate> Just sayin
<Rain> I know a guy named Sue and a girl named Henry
<BronyinJapan> Love it how 92 people are on but only like 6 ponies are chatting
<Ghosties> 04You know a girl named "Henry?"
<Shane377> Rain: wow
<Emerald_Chocolate> That's fine.
<Rain> lol
<Shane377> Ghosties: theres girls called henri which is short for henriette
<Mutterguy_> Bronies and pegasisters would make sense if Bronydom was modelled on the Catholic Church...
<Emerald_Chocolate> I know a girl calle jack and a boy called lucy.
<Starflash> hmm. Dat documentary is pretty cool oO
<Ghosties> 04Ah, that makes more sense
<BronyinJapan> Mutterguy lol right

<Rain> First episode stream I watched was season 2 ep 1
*XAX was too late to the party
<Rain> but first time I was here was week 23 of BMN

<Shane377> haha np RainbowAsh
<Rain> Babes in Toyland
<XAX> Oh lord
<Rain> boy, that was a fun movie night
<XAX> Why did that get WMC?
<Rain> Because it ended about 2 hours after everyone wanted it to
<XAX> Lol
<Rain> also, it /created/ the WMC
<BronyinJapan> Think mine was Season 2 EP 15
<XAX> How long is it? :o
<Ghosties> 04Too long
<Rain> too damn long
<Ghosties> 04Babes in Toyland is horrible
<Rain> ^
<Ghosties> 04Probably the worst film I've seen here
<Rain> ^
<Ghosties> 04And yes, like Rain said, it created the WMC
<Rain> the entire chat agreed aswell
<BronyinJapan> LOL Wish I was there to see it
<Ghosties> 04No you don't >>
<Rain> no, never wish that
<Ghosties> 04It was terribad

*XAX became a brony after reading Cupcakes

<MaidSurge> XAX: really?

<Ghosties> 04What time?
<XAX> I'm srs. It was the first MLP related content I ever looked at
<BronyinJapan> XAX LOL Cupcakes is what led me to watch the show
<XAX> voluntarily
<Starflash> Wait a sec...
<Ghosties> 04Okay
<Starflash> 48:50
<XAX> BronyinJapan: /)

<Starflash> yeah
*BronyinJapan Hugs back
<Starflash> Its like people said already, just a reference though.
<Starflash> Still cool
<Ghosties> 04Success, thanks for that
<MaidSurge> For me it was youtube poops though so I'n on the same boat :D
<Starflash> Sure thing~
<Ghosties> 04Pretty neat that he mentioned us, kinda wish he would have said something outside the documentary to one of us :I
<Spell-of-Gaming> :I
<CountDoofus> Hai everybrony
<RainbowAsh> Ohai CountDoofus
<Starflash> You mean told you that he made a reference? meh
<Spell-of-Gaming> #JustinBieberForCandyCuties2012 is trending on Twitter :I
<MaidSurge> Hi CountDoofus
<Spell-of-Gaming> HOW ABOUT NO http://th03.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2011/187/8/9/mlp___fim__rarity_no_1_by_sileresp-d3l5p43.png
<XAX> What.
<Shane377> 40:23 in the documentary
<Ghosties> 04Well yeah, it would have been neat if he had said something to one of us so we'd know
<Ghosties> 04But still, it's awesome how he mentioned us alongside only EqD and Ponychan
<BronyinJapan> lol This video crackes me up http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zqlVJNsI4o
<Shane377> when did he mention us in the doc?
<Starflash> 48:50 or so
<MaidSurge> That's how awesome this site is Ghosties!
*XAX is cold
<Ghosties> 04Thanks, we try :)
<Starflash> oh btws
<XAX> mofuking winter
<Starflash> Anypony seen Hackers last night?
*BronyinJapan Gives XAX a blacket
<Starflash> I went to bed after Bueller
<XAX> I wish I could have got up to watch it
<XAX> The anniversary movie nights start at 6am here
<XAX> -_-
<BronyinJapan> I was in school:'(
<Starflash> Oh btw, Ghosties, thx for Pi :3 thats just cool.
<MaidSurge> Starflash: me too
<Ghosties> 04Oh, hey, no problem :D
<MaidSurge> Everyone ready for some spaghetti western tonight? (Kurosawa will sue)
<Ghosties> 04I was planning on changing it if the viewers didn't like Requiem for a Dream too much but it appears that most people really enjoyed the film
<Starflash> Ok
<MaidSurge> Ghosties: is Pi equally depressing?
<XAX> Ghosties: Your chat commentary during movie nights make them so much funnier ^_^ Thanks
<Starflash> Just wondering which The Wall you guys will show. There are a lot of The Wall's.
<MaidSurge> The Pink Floyd one I think
<Shane377> Ghosties: what were u playing on changing it to?
<RainbowAsh> MaidSurge, I love myself a good spagetti western
<Starflash> MaidSurge: Pi isn't really depressing, rather thrilling
<Starflash> so it's rather a connection of emotional weight, I guess
<MaidSurge> RainbowAsh: my mom hates them, I don't mind them :)
<Shane377> MaidSurge: u mum h8 ponies/
<Shane377> ?
<MaidSurge> My mom hates spaghetti western
<MaidSurge> Or western in general
<Starflash> what do you guys mean with spaghetti.
<RainbowAsh> MaidSurge, I was about to say that I don't understand how someone can dislike an entire genre, but then again, Romantic Comedies.
<XAX> oh lawd
<RainbowAsh> Starflash, because they are filmed mostly in Italy
<MaidSurge> Starflash: it was a subgenre of western so called because it was born in Italy :D
<Starflash> oo ok.
<Starflash> Dat stereotypical naming
<Shane377> i heard the part about colgate
<Shane377> lol she was named that cause her mane loooked like toothpaste
<Starflash> ehm.. yeah
<MaidSurge> I'm iffy about romantic comedies too, unless they're something like Shaun of the Dead :D
<Starflash> why did you think :P
<XAX> I watched Ballad of the Brony before i ever watched an episode of the show
<BronyinJapan> Imma get off, bye everypony;)
<MaidSurge> XAX: were you impressed?
<RainbowAsh> MaidSurge, I wouldn't put Shaun of the Dead in that category, though
<XAX> So when I finally did, I sat there saying "OH LOOK, THERE'S THAT BACKGROUND PONY BALLAD OF THE BRONY WAS TALKING ABOUT"
<XAX> MaidSurge: Mmm
<MaidSurge> It's a mix of zombie movies and romantic guwaffing, really
<Ghosties> 04<Shane377> Ghosties: what were u playing on changing it to? <-- Probably Shawshank Redemption
<Shane377> ahh k
<Ghosties> 04<MaidSurge> Ghosties: is Pi equally depressing? <-- Not so much, but it still has that paranoia goodness :)
<Ghosties> 04<XAX> Ghosties: Your chat commentary during movie nights make them so much funnier ^_^ Thanks <-- I appreciate the compliment :)
<MaidSurge> We need to put Fargo or The Big Lebowski as movie night candidates
<XAX> I'll probably only be able to catch Friday's anniversary movies (Friday 2 pm in the states is Saturday 6am here)
<Shane377> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4826/
<Starflash> Good guy Ghosties > reacting to old comments he missed~
<RainbowAsh> MaidSurge, true, but, strange as it sounds, it isn't as shallow as most mainstream romantic comedies. Also everything is better with zombies. And bromance.
<MaidSurge> XAX: where do you live?
<XAX> MaidSurge: New Zulund
<XAX> yeah yeah, *Zealand. I know.
<MaidSurge> RainbowAsh: Ikr :) that's how most comedies should be, zombies or not
<Shane377> XAX: http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/307/8/c/you_shall_not_pass_by_edokage-d4ex754.jpg
<Shane377> and MaidSurge maid time is over
<MaidSurge> XAX: I'm a master of typos, so I won't say anything
<MaidSurge> I LOOK GOOD IN THIS SO I WON'T TAKE IT OFF
<RainbowAsh> MaidSurge, yrah, there are too many movies that just don't care about characters and messages.
<MaidSurge> I only accept shallowness as a parody
<Candy_Mane> hello there everybody :)
<Ghosties> 04Hello new person
<Rain> probably only knew to you, Ghosties
<Rain> :p
<RainbowAsh> Hai Candy_Mane
<Rain> new*
<CountDoofus> Hai Candy_Mane
<RainbowAsh> Even in parodies I find shallowness sometimes grating, especially if it's attempted to make it the only trait of a character. It's just been done to death and the parody often isn't that different from what 'serious' movies contain.
<Starflash> ugh. mfw I missed like 4 out of 6 of them nominated B movies. =w= I should come here more often
<Ghosties> 04Indeed, I suppose Candy_Mane is new to me :P
<prince-dari> God, someone donated $10,000 to that bronycon documentary project...?
<MaidSurge> You should Starflash :3c
*Rain hugs prince-dari "Long time no see!"
<prince-dari> Hey Rain! :>
<Starflash> But but but I was so busy T_T
*prince-dari hugs Rain
<Starflash> Ohai prince-dari ^^
<RainbowAsh> prince-dari, mind = blown. I know fans like to spend their money, but this is just wow.
*CloudRunner hugs back
<prince-dari> Hey Starflash.
<MaidSurge> Sorry, but I'll keep that little money I have with me (if there's no big charity involved)
<RainbowAsh> MaidSurge,
<Candy_Mane> prince-dari: i bet it was gabe newel
<Candy_Mane> well not really but ...
<Ghosties> 04Oh hey, the chatroom is alive again
<292AB9WF3> 2O_o
<Starflash> ikr~
<292AB9WF3> 2I like this nick
<prince-dari> Who?
<Candy_Mane> Ghosties: YAY
<MaidSurge> What RainbowAsh?
<Ghosties> 04YOU KNOW WHO, YOU BRITISH ASSCLOWN
<RainbowAsh> MaidSurge, as long as you don't have money, like me, that's ok. But there are also fans out there that do have some disposable income and it comes quite natural to spend it on what they like.
<Candy_Mane> prince-dari: he is the one who created TF2 he is a brony
<prince-dari> Trolololo. (:
<RainbowAsh> MaidSurge, sorry, I spoke too soon before. ^^;
<Ghosties> 04Oh, Dari
<Candy_Mane> i has prove
<Ghosties> 04Dude
<Ghosties> 04have you been around lately?
<MaidSurge> I still don't have an income :(
<prince-dari> Nope, exams
<prince-dari> Taking a break today though
<Ghosties> 04Wow
<Ghosties> 04You missed it
<prince-dari> It?
<Ghosties> 04In the midst of our anniversary weekend, Silverscreen returned
<prince-dari> Wow
<Ghosties> 04And he rejoined the team
<prince-dari> HAH, that's AWESOME
<Ghosties> 04I KNOW RIGHT
<Ghosties> 04I knew you'd be stoked to see him back :D
<prince-dari> Rebuilding the OG team! :D
<Ghosties> 04I know :)
<Ghosties> 04Except Hipster hasn't returned any of my messages >_<
<prince-dari> :<
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, I know
<Ghosties> 04But still, almost all of the original crew is here
<Ghosties> 04You should definitely hang out Friday, Silverscreen will be around for BMN
<BlueFlare> 02derp
<Rain> What is this, +m?
<Rain> Why is nobody else talking? XD
<Starflash> Nah, the rest of the room is lettin em reminiscence for a bit.
<prince-dari> I'll definitely turn up if I can
<RainbowAsh> MaidSurge, keep looking, I am sure something will turn up for you eventually. ^^
<Rain> Im all for that, but still
<Ghosties> 04Awesome man, I look forward to some classic BronyState :>
<Starflash> woohoo~
<Ghosties> 04He even brought back his RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA too XD
<prince-dari> Now all we need is some Battlefield Leverage.
<Starflash> ohhh. That was silverscreen?
<prince-dari> Hahaha, damn I've missed his movie trivia
<Ghosties> 04Speaking of that, I'm incredibly disappointed that Battlefield Leverage didn't even make Best B film nomination
<Starflash> cool.
<prince-dari> What
<Ghosties> 04Seriously
<MaidSurge> Fuck leverage, we require more vespene gas!
<Ghosties> 04It didn't make it
<prince-dari> But it's the best film we've ever shown
<Ghosties> 04I know
<Ghosties> 04I know
<Ghosties> 04Leverage didn't even win best meme :(
<prince-dari> Damn, I am disappointed.
<MaidSurge> Sea ponies won
<Starflash> What was the leverage thing again? <.<
<prince-dari> ...
<Ghosties> 04...
<prince-dari> Clearly too many new members Ghosties, not enough OG who remember the good times.
<Ghosties> 04Too true
*Rain remembers
<Ghosties> 04I miss how things were
<Rain> so does pepridge farm
<Ghosties> 04It was such an awesome night
<prince-dari> Yeah, I'm with you there...
<MaidSurge> Oh don't make me feel bad :'(
<Starflash> So, whats it then =w= sorry for only being here for 7-8 months
<Ghosties> 04I counted how many times Leverage was said and then at the climax of the film everybody started RPing with the film and saying leverage all over the place XD
<Ghosties> 04Like it was one big damn warfield in chat
<prince-dari> Virtually every single comment during the whole film was about leverage
<Shiny_Latias> Herp
*Rain remembers bowing down to the Bowie crotch
<prince-dari> Leverage was said > 1000 times
<MaidSurge> Not enough leverage?
<prince-dari> It was just amazing
<Ghosties> 04NEVER ENOUGH LEVERAGE
<Ghosties> 04Red Leverage, reporting
<prince-dari> Oh damn, I just remembered pizzacake as well. XD
<prince-dari> PIZZACAKEPIZZACAKEPIZZACAKE
<Ghosties> 04Pizzacake?
<Ghosties> 04>feels bad he doesn't know what Dari's talking about
<Mutterguy_> I think Rain is really the only old timer
<Starflash> ._.
<Ghosties> 04@Mutterguy: I hope you're only talking about viewerwise
<Ghosties> 04Because I've been here since the very first Movie night
<Starflash> mfw older people calling me new and shit. =w=
<Starflash> oh wells.
<Mutterguy_> of course!
*Ghosties nods
<MaidSurge> But where was Gondor when we required more leverage?
<Ghosties> 04Eh, don't take too much offense Starflash
<Starflash> Naw, I just wanna see BF earth right now :D
<CountDoofus> *throws railings into the mix*
<Ghosties> 04This kinda happens when two or more people of the original team get together
<Rain> how many weeks has BMN ran so far?
<Mutterguy_> one simplly doesn't walk into Mordor, they take the bus!
<prince-dari> Ty, it was because all the humans kept shouting pice of cake. :P
<Rain> because I came in at weak 23
<Starflash> CountDoofus: you saw that railing animation last night?
<prince-dari> piece*
<Ghosties> 04OH GOD
<Starflash> That was simply awesome.
<Ghosties> 04YOU MEAN WHEN THAT WAS LIKE THEIR FIRST WORDS
<Ghosties> 04THAT THEY LEARNED
<CountDoofus> Wasn't here last light, so nope, sadly :(
<prince-dari> Yeah!
<prince-dari> PIZZACAKE PIZZACAKE
<Starflash> aw ok :T
<Ghosties> 04XDDD Fucking hilarious!
<MaidSurge> Piece of cake
<Ghosties> 04Man, shit, we gotta show Battlefield Leverage again
*Mutterguy_ has bussed across 'The Desert' where Mordor was set
<CountDoofus> light? night*
<prince-dari> Evil Dead 2 needs a restream as well.
<Ghosties> 04Speaking on that...
<Ghosties> 04Oh, I can't say anything :I
<Starflash> Anyways (I believe it was Luna?) there was a pony animation about the necessity of railings.
<CountDoofus> Had a busy week thus far, haven't been able to catch any movie :'(
<prince-dari> Is it just me, or the films we streamed back then were so much more awesome?
<Rain> almost gave something away, Ghosties. you need to be more careful :p
<prince-dari> We got memes out of the films every week
<Ghosties> 04Times were different
<Ghosties> 04To be fair we got a meme out of a movie on Monday
<prince-dari> OH GOD, now I'm thinking about FLOOT and barrels.
<Ghosties> 04...though you'll never guess which one
<Starflash> ..Meanwhile still gets memes out of films every week though
<Ghosties> 04OH
<Ghosties> 04AND
<Ghosties> 04DUDE
<Ghosties> 04speaking of FLOOT and barrels
<Ghosties> 04We're showing A Fistful of Dollars today
<prince-dari> HAHA, AWESOME
<prince-dari> So much nostalgia.
<Starflash> Meme outta the movies on Monday?
<Starflash> You mean Sumerpan?
<MaidSurge> All this Battlefield talk and no "when you were learning how to SPELL YOUR NAME"
<Ghosties> 04Yeah
<prince-dari> This happens every time we talk Ty. XD
<Starflash> Well yeah.
<Ghosties> 04We got a new meme out of Superman IV
<Ghosties> 04Since we showed it on Monday
<Ghosties> 04Nittany accidentally called him 'Sumerpan'
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Ghosties> 04And I immediately started noticing how awesome it was
<Ghosties> 04So I called attention to it
<Starflash> And then someone made a poster about Sumerpan - The warrior of Bronystate.
<Ghosties> 04We got a new pic and a new drawing out of it :D
<MaidSurge> Sumerpan is an awesome name.
<prince-dari> Hahaha. XD
<Ghosties> 04But man, I expect you to be there for a restream of Battlefield Leverage
<prince-dari> Oh, don't worry, I wouldn't miss it for anything.
<MaidSurge> Ferris Bueller should be "Ferris Bufferin's day off"
<MaidSurge> Were you there Ghosties?
<Starflash> Although, MaidSurge, the "So much bufferiiiiiiing" doesnt count as a meme
<Starflash> Plus we already have a better buffering pic out of the iron giant :D
<BlueFlare> 02:3
<MaidSurge> We got a few new pics out of the movie though, courtesy of Meanwhile
<MaidSurge> And a new "haha! time for ponies" pic
<Rain> Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
<Ghosties> 04Awesome Dari :D
<Ghosties> 04Was I there for what, MaidSurge?
<prince-dari> INB4 BronyState worst movie night with Epic Movie, Spider's Web, and Babe's in Toyland.
<Ghosties> 04NO
<prince-dari> :D
<MaidSurge> For Ferris Bueller
<Ghosties> 04We can't do that :O
<Ghosties> 04It's against the rule
<Starflash> Thank god.
<prince-dari> Rules were made to be broken.
<Ghosties> 04Oh, for Bueller? Nope ><
<Ghosties> 04There's no way in hell we'd show those three films again
<prince-dari> One day...
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<prince-dari> SOON.jpg
<MaidSurge> Showing horrible movies is against the rules?
<Ghosties> 04Least of all fucking Babes in Toyland
<Starflash> suddenly ALL the wc's...
<Ghosties> 04Oh man, SOON.jpg
<Ghosties> 04...you just made me think of Bjornfot
<Ghosties> 04I miss Bjornfot :(
<prince-dari> At least Spider's Web isn't WMCed.
<Chimera> Nya
<BlueFlare> 02Chimera :3
<prince-dari> Haha, that crazy bastard.
<BlueFlare> 02hi
<prince-dari> Bjornfort is best fort.
<Ghosties> 04Yes he is
<Ghosties> 04Man I miss him

<HyperMetalLugia> I want rockbox or something decent on there
<Twi_Fi> Now there needs to be a drawing of all the ponies who visit bronystate.
<CountDoofus|ME3> Well... it remains to be seen, then. I'm visiting a friend in Amarillo, and I don't want him to feel snubbed if I decide to cut my visit short with 3 days, plus I've also paid for a hotel room I won't be using for 3 days.
<Litwick> Who is this Diftaku person?

<Bronies4evar> Please stream "Last roundup" this sunday morning at 8/7c so we can all see if derpy was resureccted by the power of love.
<CountDoofus|ME3> I'm craving some KFC, actually, but Blue Bell vanilla ice cream sounds good for dessert :)
<Bronies4evar> It's 8:15 pm here, which was the former airtime of Regular show.
<flutter_spin> I can't believe I lost 15 pounds

<flutter_spin> Well, whenever she cooks a meal, she makes enough to last 4 days
<ofna01> a soldier died in the field of battle and came up to the gates of heaven,where he met god. He said to god,"Lord,i know i did many things im not proud of,and many more you wouldnt approve of,so if you send me to hell,i wont argue. god stood there for a moment,then turned to the gatekeeper. "let him in", he said. the gatekeeper,confused,asked why. god looked down at the soldier and said,"this man just came from hell."

<CrazyCherry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-awBxtI8IDw This is my everyday...
<Kammerjunk> Actually, a golf ball is probably one of the worst things you can get hit with related to sport.
<prince-dari> I'd say cricket ball is worse.
<CrazyCherry> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVUEYlyQVI8

<Kammerjunk> prince-dari: But does a cricket ball hit you with an equally bad speed?
<LightTrooper105> and to have all plane and explosion without lag you must have a super PC
<twilight_sprinkler> indeed.
<CrazyCherry> OH SHIT!
<Kammerjunk> Dat Twilight.
<ShiningArmor> Uhhh
<[Zzz]JRP2234> Kammerjunk cricket ball is hard
<Shane377> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yophEP0gIbo&feature=plcp
<CrazyCherry> Don't ask.
<Dark92Enigma> HOW BOUT NO
<prince-dari> Kammerjunk: Dunno, but I'm press sure batsman have to wear helmets because it could kill them if it hit them in the face.
<CrazyCherry> ....
<ofna01> LOL
<ShiningArmor> O-O
<Yokupony> ..................wat?
<prince-dari> pretty*
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Oh, this fandom.
<Litwick> >complains about cloppers >bronies is about accepting people despite who they are
<CrazyCherry> Wat.
<ShiningArmor> Yes!
<Dark92Enigma> What's the name of the video
<Kammerjunk> This is like Pony Thread Simulator 4.2.
<CrazyCherry> WAT!
<prince-dari> ...
<Dark92Enigma> Poor Dash
<prince-dari> Damn this is messed up
<Dark92Enigma> LOL
<Litwick> Seriously. Bitching about cloppers when you're a brony is ridiculous.
<Dark92Enigma> sooooooooooooooooooo Wrong!
<RainbowcrashNBurn> 0.o
<Kammerjunk> prince-dari: Ah. I think I mistook cricket with another sport.
<Shane377> this is actually messed up
<CrazyCherry> prince-dari: In know right?
<Dark92Enigma> WROOOOOOOOOONG
<Bronies4evar> 9.51 am BST (Bronystate Time) now.
<diddutz> Why isn't there a seperate Internet for those ppl ...
<Litwick> Ok: beware an incoming rant from me.
<ofna01> NOVA
<Kammerjunk> Dat Ghost.
<CrazyCherry> Wat.
<Yokupony> So much for love and tolerence....
<Shane377> NOVA is that u
<prince-dari> ...
<ofna01> it was nova
<ShiningArmor> I saw a video of the guy saying GOD DAMMIT
<prince-dari> Why...
<Kammerjunk> This is so many kinds of funny.
<RainbowcrashNBurn> ...
<MaidSurge> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjQejI1A7-I Can we watch some fighting game? :D
<Dark92Enigma> i don't want to know the title anymote
*Twi_Fi cries.
*Om shudders
<Dark92Enigma> anymore*
<CrazyCherry> LOL!!!
<Litwick> Bitching about cloppers when you're a brony is retarded beyond beleif and eliminates the sole purpose of bronies.
<Kammerjunk> ShiningArmor: It sounded like Ghost from True Capitalist Radio to me.
<Bronies4evar> Thank god I muted before it said *censored*.
<ShiningArmor> Wait who r we watching click videos
<oatflake> ok just talking
<ofna01> i dont want to live on this planet anymore....
<Dark92Enigma> THIS WAS.........shocking
<Yokupony> I agree with Litwick
<CrazyCherry> AND THAT'S MY EVERYDAY FOLKS!!
<Kammerjunk> Oh yes.
<Kammerjunk> Clash.
<Yokupony> yay ^_^
<Twi_Fi> yay
<Dark92Enigma> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ6gC_4q9tg
<MaidSurge> It's back to the better part of the fandom! :D
<prince-dari> Bleh, too many requests.
<Kammerjunk> Litwick: I agree. I myself don't "clop", but I don't have a problem with people who do. I've spent enough time on the Internet to see worse things.
<Litwick> By being a brony, you accept people into your fandom for who they are, regardless of what they do. Insulting cloppers because of who they are AS broies is EXTREMELY hypocritical.
<Shane377> prince-dari: can u show mine plz
<ShiningArmor> R we watching people here click videos o-o?
<Shane377> prince-dari: u will defs laugh
<Litwick> Glad to get that off my chest.

<LordCelestia> 0,5Don't.
<RainBroDash> 10Challenge accepted?
<LordCelestia> 0,5Everyone knows that I have a secret alternate universe ship with everybody I meet
<Om> Warning considered
<RX-78-SweetieBot> LordCelestia's banana x ScootaJailbait
<Kammerjunk> LordCelestia: According to the theory of the multiverse, I suppose that'd always be true.
<MaidSurge> LordCelestia: I don't care about any shipping, so I won't care about yours either
<LordCelestia> 0,5x3
<LordCelestia> 0,5Jailbait, or Johnny bait, is slang for a person who is younger than the legal age of consent for sexual activity, but physically mature enough to be mistaken for an adult, with the implication that a non-deviant older person might reasonably find them sexually attractive. The term is highly nuanced due to its criminal law connotations. In the United States, the age of consent varies
<LordCelestia> 0,5by state, so the age at which a person can be considered "jailbait' varies.
<Kammerjunk> wat
<LordCelestia> 0,5So THATS what it means.....
<RainBroDash> 10... you didn't know?
<prince-dari> You didn't know?
<Kammerjunk> I always thought it meant something different.
<LordCelestia> 0,5Not completely
<RainBroDash> 10get out of my head!
<prince-dari> That's why Scootachicken is jailbait.
<RainBroDash> 10^
<Kammerjunk> I thought it meant someone who was above the legal age of consent, but looked younger.
<RainBroDash> 10the opposite :D
<LordCelestia> 0,5I actually thought it meant someone who gets raped in jail a lot and loves it
<Kammerjunk> wat
<RainBroDash> 10O________________________________O
<LunaTheBeloved> xD
<prince-dari> If you think about the word, it makes sense.
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Wow
<valoreins> ...
<prince-dari> Jail...Bait...
<LordCelestia> 0,5Which is why I thought Scootachicken was jailbait
<Dusky> Lol, LordCelestia
<Yokupony> Old people in a nutshell
<prince-dari> Because you are younger than you look.
<Litwick> LC, if you ship me, I'm voting for Luna.
<RainBroDash> 10indeed, and you're like bait for jailtime :D
<LordCelestia> 0,5Huh
<MaidSurge> I'm no jaibait
<prince-dari> And I'm always in your head Olly.
<prince-dari> :P
<SlurryMoon> 3heheheh x3
<LordCelestia> 0,5I knew it meant a young sexual person, but I didnt know the exact words for it
<RainBowJack> scotaloo is jailbait indeed
<prince-dari> Not Scootaloo.
<prince-dari> Scootachicken.
<prince-dari> :P
<RainBowJack> NO she no Chicken :[
<RX-78-SweetieBot> LordCelestia, this explains SO MUCH
<Kammerjunk> What's this about best mod?
<Om> Not a clue
<Kammerjunk> RainBowJack: No no, the person on BronyState named Scootachicken.
<valoreins> Tom is best mod
<prince-dari> I KNOW NOTHING

<red_ony2> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_gun
<Very_Silly_Filly> But that's false alarm, as it always makes me think it's Sumica
<Midnight_Fyre> It wasn't a Maxim or a Volley gun
<DitzyHooves> OH YEAH
<Sumica> 00,10huh? what's that?
<Kammerjunk> Starflash: Cleast Eintwood.

<SlurryMoon> 3^Sumerpan
*GilDash kisses Om.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumerpan is best hero
<GilDash> Om: You're forgiven. :)
<Kandarihu> Man, I'm really not following this story very well.
<Kammerjunk> He is not the hero BronyState needs.
<Dark_Horst> Midnight_Fyre: course it didnt. the guy who wanted this in the movie appearantly didnt do his homework. it looked liek a volley gun and behaved like a browning
<fluttercry> 05,15Kandarihu he's playing both sides of the conflict for money. He works for both crime lords
<Very_Silly_Filly> Shaddap Kammerjunk, you're ruining the moment
<GilDash> Kandarihu: Westerns have story beyond honour and shootings?
<Om> GilDash: That didn't make me feel forgiven.
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: Sorry D:
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm sorry, I was harsh :c
<Kandarihu> Okay. Thanks
*alexxm hugs GilDash
*Flutters likes this film
<Kencolt> Hmm... it looked like a volley gun, but fired more like a gatling or maxim... in other words it's movie convention.
*Very_Silly_Filly spins and explodes
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: Ha ha ha. Story.
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: wat
<red_ony2> the story in this is actually quite nice..if lifted directly from another movie
<DitzyHooves> inb4 Troll_manwithnoname
<GilDash> Om: Believe me, if you weren't forgiven the punishment would be *much* more severe. ;)
<Kammerjunk> Yes, Terry. Mine for BRAINS!
*GilDash hugs alexxm.
<LilB> GilDash of course they have! Just like Japanese movies have more then just Honour and Samurais
<DitzyHooves> Clint Eastwood is going to be troll

<ACS13123|TF2> i dont get it :/
<fluttercry> 05,15red_ony2 yeah Sergio Leone admits that this is a remake of Yojimbo. But the other two of the series are also very good and those are original stories
<GilDash> Om: Maybeee... Keep asking and you'll get another. ;)
<Om> ........
<red_ony2> he had to pay royalties as well imo
<red_ony2> for zthis movie
*GilDash brushes Om's mane.
<SonicTheStallion> Another what? Can I haz? :3
<Om> e_o
<GilDash> Om: Your hair is all tangled...
<Midnight_Fyre> Fun Fact: There was another remake of this story also with Bruce Wilis in the 20s or 30s, but nobody cares about that one
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Om> GilDash: Its wavy, its gets that way.
<alexxm> whats it called Midnight_Fyre
<LilB> fluttercry it's funny another western (whos name i can't recall) is also just a Western version of The Seven Samurai, the smae director who made Yojimbo
<SirGanjalf> alexxm: Last Boy Scout

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're going to have fun with them!
<Midnight_Fyre> Fun Fact: Kurosawa got started by making propaganda movies during WWII. They were OK, but not as good as his later stuff
<Very_Silly_Filly> Google is retardedly slow today
<SirGanjalf> And then: RDR Undead Nightmare
<Tovler|Twibfm> thepiratebay is blazingly fast today
<red_ony2> Rashomon is my favourite kurasawa
<Kammerjunk> PrincessLuna: Qui? ._.
<red_ony2> simple and brilliant
<derpy_pony> I heard they were under a ddos attack a few hours ago, Tovler|Twibfm
<Kammerjunk> Et "quod".
<Midnight_Fyre> Seven Samurai was the first Kurosawa film I saw. It's also my favorite
<GilDash> Kammerjunk: Where's you other one? The upside-downy one?

<fluttercry> 05,15Fun Fact: RDR has 3 chapters, each based off of the different styles of westerns. Chapter1: Classic John Wayne, Chapter 2: Spaghetti Westerns, Chapter 3: New, gritty westerns
<LilB> Midnight_Fyre mine too. Such an awesome movie
<Kammerjunk> GilDash: Non intellego.
<red_ony2> it is :)
<Calcos323> fluttercry: Cool, I never noticed that while playing
<Tovler|Twibfm> Piratebay's been gone for over a day. That's all I know.
<DaringDude> wat movie is this?
<Dken2021> pirate bay's gone now?
<Kandarihu> So a Space Western would be out of the question for RDR orwhat?
<SonicTheStallion> *hops around the place randomnly*
<Tovler|Twibfm> Space Cowboys?
<BaltoDork> showing up late. fashionably.
<SirGanjalf> What about acid western?
<Midnight_Fyre> If I pick Seven Samurai for A movie would they play it, or would they not like the idea of a 3.5 hour black and white foreign film?
<LilB> Cowboy Bebop?

<Icy> HELLOOO, what are we watching !?! SUP
<DitzyHooves> preemptive yay
<Pony> Midnight_Fyre, next movie should have been first choice

<GilDash> Icy: Holla! :)
<Midnight_Fyre> SirGanjalf: ikr
<Starflash> East Clintwood is owning shit and stuff. So yeah
<DitzyHooves> Hoof-ful of Bits

<Kammerjunk> I have Clockwork Orange somewhere on my hard disk, but I've never watched it.
<Midnight_Fyre> Kandarihu: It's a classic, a perfect character study
<red_ony2> you should

<Midnight_Fyre> SirGanjalf: :D
<SirGanjalf> oops, wrong link: http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&section=&q=pinkie+orange#/d4vj42k
<MaidSurge> Kammerjunk: I don't but Pink Floyd are an immensely awesome band
<red_ony2> the new restored version of metropolis`?
<Pony> DitzyHooves, first choice I said :P
<SirGanjalf> ;)
<DitzyHooves> You guys should stream EDEN OF THE EAST
<Kammerjunk> Resaluta itera!
<Om> PrincessLuna: You leave a lot.
<DitzyHooves> its a good show
<Shizuka> 13DitzyHooves: except RHPS and Hackers
<fluttercry> 05,15LilB that's not how the Lottery works
<LilB> red_ony2 I wished they would use the new version
<Kammerjunk> MaidSurge: That they are.
<PrincessLuna> Om: Sorry :( A friend of mine that was visiting from out of state just left
<Kencolt> What I'd like to see-- if possible-- would be Yojombo and the original Japanese version of Godzilla. Subbed, of course.
<GilDash> Om: You try to. ;)
<DitzyHooves> HAckers was an A movie
<SirGanjalf> Also I'd love to see my favourite Kubrick movie: FMJ
<Midnight_Fyre> LilB: Glad I'm not the only one who has nominated a silent movie (My B movie is Nosferatu)
<DitzyHooves> or at least an A-
<prince-dari> [19:37] <Shamroc> no game streams? aka superbrony playin skylanders again
<Om> PrincessLuna: Ahh, I understand then.
<Shizuka> 13much as i'd love to agree with you.. it isn't
<prince-dari> SB play Skylanders?

<prince-dari> Very.

<LunaTheBeloved> Yeah
<Om> GilDash: Soo >>
*Rain hugs Shizuka

<LunaTheBeloved> I dunno, it looked kinda cool
<Shizuka> 13do you ever sleep? :3
<derpy_pony> they all die so clean. no one pukes out his intestines or cries for his mother two hours long
<Rain> yes ^_^
<fluttercry> 05,15no...no you subscribe to the newsletter and fill out the lottery ticket that comes with it
<prince-dari> It ruined Spyro. :/
<prince-dari> And shat on my childhood
<Rain> I slept well, Shizu dear <3
<Starflash> Meh.
<red_ony2> I didn't know so many people here had really good taste in movies! :D (no offence)
<DitzyHooves> I would love to see Rescuers down under
<Kammerjunk> Damn, these guys are gullible.
<Shizuka> 13<3
*somepony_else hugs Midnight_Fyre for choosing nosferatu
<SirGanjalf> derpy_pony: It's not Saving Private Ryan;)
*Midnight_Fyre hugs somepony_else back
<Kandarihu> I pick the 10th One Piece movie as my A Movie.
*Starflash has no idea what Skylanders is. oO
<Jim> ohai everypony
*Rain checks her skype for her last message sent
<BaltoDork> Has anybody here seen Felidae? Probably too gory to show here but just a random question.. I was just curious considering it's not that well known.
<Midnight_Fyre> hi Jim
<PrincessLuna> Eventually they're all just going to be laying on the stomachs reading comics and occasionally shooting at each other looking bored
<red_ony2> i hAVCE FELIDAE
<DitzyHooves> they were already dead you idiot
<Rain> I fell asleep around 6:35am, Shizuka
<RainbowAsh> I am off again, visiting a friend. Bai
<Jim> What are we watching?
<Starflash> Ohai Jim :3
<Shizuka> 13oh my
<red_ony2> its a nice enough movie
<LilB> fluttercry ok... :/ Then the persorn i asked about how to make an movie entry ether lied or derped :/
<Midnight_Fyre> Jim: A Fistful of Dollars
<BaltoDork> red_ony2: I really loved Felidae. ^^ more than I thought I would.
<Rain> but I slept until 12:40, so it is ok, Shizu <3
<LunaTheBeloved> Well, I was never into Spyro
<Jim> ooh, neat
<red_ony2> the sex scene was great :D
<BaltoDork> I also have the book, but it's on my kindle and I'm missing the charger.. so.. oops. XD
<derpy_pony> leather bags!
<BaltoDork> red_ony2: I laughed through that scene XD I thought he and Felicity were adorable though ;_;
<Calcos323> You made a mistake, Clint.
<PrincessLuna> falcopunch!
<prince-dari> The PS1 Spyro games are just awesome.
<Om> She got hit.
<prince-dari> TLOS is meh.
<Starflash> errr... woopsie
<Kandarihu> But I guess the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th could be considered A movies. 1st, 7th, 8th, and 9th would be B movies. 3rd is WMC material.
<prince-dari> And the PS2 Spyro games are pretty meh
<Pony> Clint would be the best Brony (inb4 Chuck Norris sells out again)
<Kammerjunk> LilB: Probably neither. When you've subscribed to the lottery, you get a lottery "ticket" in the way that you are able to fill out a form listing the two films you want chosen.
<prince-dari> And Skylanders is a piece of shit.
<derpy_pony> bury her in desert before someone misses her
<derpy_pony> too late
<PrincessLuna> Surprise buttsecks
<Starflash> oh. Ok
<BaltoDork> How do you subscribe to the lottery? o3o
<prince-dari> It's like that stupid cartoony version of Prince Of Persia that came along and shat all over the GOOD PoP games.
<ScootaChicken> so prince-dari, I herd u liek Spyro?

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01GilDash: I mis-spelled Superman.
<Om> GilDash: I would use the word untrusted.
<Kencolt> A movie about a nameless American in Mexico that was filmed in Spain. Gonna have a few glitches.
*PrincessLuna licks GilDash's cheek
<VenHur96> Lots of western movies, but I don't watch them sadly
<SirGanjalf> Midnight_Fyre: I always wondered, did Clint spoke italian in the original or did he was dubbed?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I actually laughed at the mistake.
<MaidSurge> LilB "Il mio nome è Nessuno"?
<LilB> MaidSurge sorry I don't speak that Language
<DitzyHooves> Rio Bravo is a good western
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Oh, well, it was still you who started it. :p
<PrincessLuna> He's thinking "Awkward..."
<Midnight_Fyre> SirGanjalf: I think he speaks English in them. He does speak Italian though

<PrincessLuna> Shot through the heart, and you're too late darlin you give loove a bad name

<PrincessLuna> Suckface!
<Pony> I have sworn celibacy, like a good priest should, in the honor of Nittany.
<MaidSurge> fluttercry: can you believe that there's plenty of semi-desertic landscapes here in Italy? :D
<Midnight_Fyre> How can it be an "old Mexican proverb" when the revolver and Winchester were relatively new inventions at the time?
<GilDash> Pony: Then you're a very, *very* naughty sinner, aren't you...? ;)
<Kencolt> It's paraphrasing a scene in Yojimbo where an antagonist, who has a sixgun, says that a gun will always beat a sword.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Pony: Don't start.
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk: I guess that armor will stop a bullet from a pistol, but not a rifle.
<red_ony2> rifles and pistols werent
<fluttercry> 05,15MaidSurge I would believe that yes

<Kencolt> OK... A film about an unnamed American in a Mexican border town filmed in Spain sparked the genre of Spaghetti Westerns... Spaghetti being Italian. Just wanders all over thye place, since this is based on a Japanese film inspired by the works of Dhaiell Hammet.

<LunaTheBeloved> Felling any better emangamer?
<Aurora> 6I'm working on an animation reel
<Aurora> 6it's already not too impressive imo
<CriticKitten> Vordox: It's actually rather simple. You see, according to certain political parties in the United States which shall remain nameless, teachers are rich, greedy, evil people who don't care about the poor children they teach.
*IshPonyPony turns otakon into a potato and feeds him to Nittany_Discord

<emangamer> LunaTheBeloved: not especially. I cant find my hard drive so either it actually got stolen, or I lost it and I'm going to tell them it got stolen anyway
<CriticKitten> So the natural solution to a budget shortfall is "just get rid of those evil greedy teachers and their UNIONS, it's ruining EVERYTHING"
<LunaTheBeloved> otakon, you're not a potato, but a french person
<twilight_sprinkler> Nittany_Discord: that even rhymed
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: And we <3 you. :)

<FillyFlam> Ooh, a political debate. /popcorn
<ShiningArmor> I <3 a pony :D
<DitzyHooves> didn't they try to ban interracial marriage in the 1950s, its the same thing. It's denying a group of citizens their rights, which violates the 14th amendment

<emangamer> I have TheDoctor registered I think
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So of course he'll lose.
<TheRainbowDash> GilDash: Yeah, I was really fretting on Mobday, but today, very relaxed.
<Viri> 14wait
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Care to point out precisely how Romney differs from Obama?
<FillyFlam> MFW we're still talking about this.
<emangamer> but I know I have emantrollslayer registered
<CriticKitten> I'll wait. :P
<DitzyHooves> Socialism gave us many good things
<Cypresswolf> O_O YES! I didn't miss Clint Eastwood ^_^

<ShiningArmor> <PrincessLuna> Where are youuu :(
*Viri slaps himself
<PrincessLuna> GilDash: As long as I'm on top :)
<CCCP> i dont have CCCP registered :/
<icybeauti> Obama sorta has more chances of winning though
<red_ony2> as a european i have to say...you have no idea what communism or socialism are
<WallDives> and I come back to politics. great.
<TheRainbowDash> Gunthler|Xbox: Oh hello there!
<Angel_Espeon> 13y u so unoriginal D:
<DitzyHooves> Public roads, national parks, public education
<Kandarihu> He was raised on communism from an early age. Romney wasn't.
<LunaTheBeloved> You might want to
<GilDash> TheRainbowDash: That said, don't get too relaxed. :D You need a little bit of nervous energy.
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: that is a scary thought, I dont want ron paul to win but if thats the reason he'll lose...
*Gunthler|Xbox hugs TheRainbowDash closely
<red_ony2> were i live obama would be far right
<PrincessLuna> ShiningArmor: OH SHINING ARMOR, I'LL BE THERE VERY SOON!
<Judge_Holden> and thus Clint and his pony head into the sunset

<GilDash> PrincessLuna: If you think you can take me. :p
<LunaTheBeloved> NOt that anyone else would use it
<emangamer> do eeet
<CriticKitten> Let's face it. Obama ran on a campaign that said he'd be different than Bush. LOL DIDN'T HAPPEN.
<Pony> Moive body count: Clint Eastwood - 638, Arnold Schwarzenegger - 547, Sylvester Stallone - 492, Chuck Norris - 338, so who's the best pony?
<red_ony2> nope
<CCCP> i dont know how it works though
<derpy_pony> ron paul has to many radical plans...makes too much trouble...people don't like when politicians interfere too much, Nittany_Discord
<ShiningArmor> <PrincessLuna> Hahaha!
*Pinkies4thWall hugs Nittany_Discord, RedScootScootaloo, fluttercry, and SlurryMoon. HUG PILE!
<red_ony2> its great here in germany^^

<VenHur96> Pony: All of the above.
<CriticKitten> And I'm supposed to buy this why?
<Tovler> It the racist free market would ruin my life so, I'm glad Ron Paul is gone.
<Cypresswolf> What? No - It's over? :(
<PrincessLuna> GilDash: It's not about if I think I can handle you, can you survive me ;)
<emangamer> so we dont have that shit going on again
<LunaTheBeloved> And don't forget about CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCP

*PrincessLuna spanks GilDash gently
<VenHur96> Curese you United Artistts!

<emangamer> I'm so glad the intermission song hasnt changed <3
<Pony> Movie body count: Clint Eastwood - 638, Arnold Schwarzenegger - 547, Sylvester Stallone - 492, Chuck Norris - 338, so who's the best pony? you may choose only one.
<Midnight_Fyre> CritticKitten: Healthcare, for starters
<SirGanjalf> Now i gotta find some pmv with music like in the movie.
<DitzyHooves> its called FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE

<TheRainbowDash> Movie that is not James Bond in it=not good. (just kidding):D
<CriticKitten> Midnight: It functions very, very similarly to Obama-Care, just at a state level. People have analyzed them and the similarities are undeniable.
<emangamer> CCCP: type this "/msg NickServ Register

<Midnight_Fyre> CriticKitten: The GOP doesn't care about that now, and he will do what they say. They want him to kill Obamacare and he would do it
*ShiningArmor Wonders why this is BronyState if it shows no pony shows
<emangamer> needs more hugs from RedScootScootaloo

<DitzyHooves> The romney ads don't even attack Obama properly.

<emangamer> wait RedScootScootaloo isnt that an paradox?
<otakon> ouch!
<GilDash|EqD> PrincessLuna: He doesn't seem to like me. Can't possibly imagine why... ;)
<TheRainbowDash> To get the story straight about politics, anyone will cause damage, you just pick the president that will do the least amount of damage. No one president has greatly denefitted the country.
<Tovler> I find Romney to be a prick ALL of the time, imo.
<fluttercry> 05,15ShiningArmor should pay more attention to the name and realize it's BRONYstate not PONYstate
<CriticKitten> Anyways, gonna be gone for a while. Need to inform my parents that they might need to clear out a room for me after all.

<ScootaChicken> Yeah, the last time otakon asked for ponies he ended up being a French person.
<IshPonyPony> When someone tries to block, show them your cock
<ScootaChicken> Wait hang on.

<Hawksight> god i remember the music from Civ 3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You ask for ponies, you'll get ponies. You just won't always like what you get.
<emangamer> holy shit
<WallDives> because it makes more sense to use metric instead of imperial?
<emangamer> this is insane
<emangamer> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m44sgrDoNi1r3oznx.gif
<icybeauti> GilDash|EqD: It's so easy! Customary is way too complex.
<ShiningArmor> :P
<RedScootScootaloo> 00,03I never asked for this....
<Tovler> I hope in after Obama get reelected, we hit the ground running and see if we can get some French-style Socialists into Washington.
<Starflash> apparently, you can link certain nicknames to a registered account
<emangamer> this is fucking insane
<emangamer> http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m44sgrDoNi1r3oznx.gif
<red_ony2> imperial is insane..
<emangamer> yeah
<WallDives> actually, no, I need to stay out of this.
<TheRainbowDash> icybeauti: Free leathcare will put this country in so much debt, oh wait, this country is already in debt. That will cause unbelievably negative consequences.
<Kandarihu> Look. At the very least, Mitt Romney would probably respect Congress. We know for sure that Obama wants to centralize all the power of the government in his branch. So just getting Romney elected isn't enough. We need to reform Congress as much as possible. I know the difference between the two guys don't seem substantial on the surface. But if Congress sends Pres Romney a bill to repeal Obamacare, he'll probably sign it, eve
<CCCP> :o emangamer
<Midnight_Fyre> I want G4 pon ies as seen on the Hub
<PrincessLuna> Yea, earlier sucked T_T

<icybeauti> TheRainbowDash: I wanna move to europe. It's less worst there.
<Om> You don't actualy have a direct vote in america
<Tovler> The Constitution is so vague. It's no wonder other countries haven't modeled their governments after it.
<WallDives> so yeah, someone get me when political discussion is over.
<emangamer> Nittany_Discord: when do you think we can portal it up?
<RedScootScootaloo> 00,03Sorry twilight_sprinkle, I don't listen to rap~

<IshPonyPony> I can haz sexy tiem
<icybeauti> Most people don't care about politics here. The only voting we do is American Idol and things like that.

<FillyFlam> Hiya SB
<emangamer> blind bags?
<Obsidian> Hi SuperBrony64
<Midnight_Fyre> Kandarihu: His economic policy is to some extent OK, but he is way too extreme. If the GOP wants to remain relevent it needs to find a sane middle ground between the Santorum/Gingrich wing and the Paul wing of the party

<Tovler> It bugs the crap out of me that the southerners were all Dixiecrats and love big government. Suddenly women and black got a people of the pie and then those same Dixiecrats discovered their inner Ron Paul.
