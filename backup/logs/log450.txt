<Ascendant> go fix the stats now
<superretroworld> Saturn: pills that cures stomach aches i meant
<drf-Droid> LOL
<nettrilex> how do you get over your dads death i really need to know
<Saturn> 8,1otakon: well, actually, food that's been out for a while is okay so long as it's cooked after
<Kyubree> 07I told you that didn't fix it lol
<WallDives> nettrilex: time.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn: just pump your stomach with a common household vacuum cleaner.
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> ^
<WallDives> and acceptance.
<CupcakeWarrior> I had food poisoning once, it woke me up at 4 in the morning and lasted all day
<Ascendant> You changed it in all the themes?
<Saturn> 8,1so if it was cooked, then left out, then that's bad
<Obsidian> Thanks for the eps Wrek
<Ascendant> And the main theme as well?
<Saturn> 8,1but if you nuke the shit out of it, it'll be fine
<Ascendant> Because that should have fixed it
<Ponies47> I feel like dancing
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey ascendant
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: We don't need to round op the maids for Saturn, do we? ;)
<Ascendant> hi
<Ponies47> Dances
<nettrilex> time?
<otakon> Saturn: it was old deer roast that I ate that was sitting out in 90 degree weather then cooked
<Biglaw> CupcakeWarrior ouch...

<Dark92Enigma> Ok, gotta go everypony......college first thing in the morning......SHOW (is) OFF

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maid Hour is taking a break.
<otakon> pony_801122: you random
<pony_801122> wait ccan i make a username?
<Saturn> 8,1otakon: there are some toxins that won't be gotten rid of by cooking
<RainbowAsh> nettrilex, in most cases, you don't. But it gets easier with time. After a while at least.
<Dark92Enigma> Ponies47 the essence of all comedy......TIMING!
<HyperMetalLugia> Making a shell script, as I'm on Mint12 now
<Dark92Enigma> bye
<otakon> pony_801122: use /nick
<pony_801122> ok
<Saturn> 8,1but you won't get an infection from properly cooked meat
<Ascendant> lol mint 12
<otakon> Saturn: yeah, I figured
*Ascendant dislikes mint 12
<Saturn> 8,1so it's mostly likely that it was the undercooking, rather than the leaving out
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It really depends if people can stop RPing in here.
<Ascendant> what sort of shell script? I'm not very good at bash
<SirGanjalf> Is there gonna be another ep?
<pony_801122> Alright, this is my first MLP chat place ever
<otakon> Saturn: I cooked it until it was damn near burnt, two hours at 350 degrees F
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> LOLNOPE
<nettrilex> okay well at lease it gets better at least thank you
<Ascendant> I can do it but I haven't actually really looked into it
<Kyubree> 07there's a preview in the css editor, when I changed any of the themes it didn't help fix it
<pony_148> ok guys bye im off now
<superretroworld> Saturn: were the burgers pink inside?
<Ponies47> HEY EVERYPONY! Sparkle sparkle sprakle
<Ascendant> Kyu, the preview is retarded
<Saturn> 8,1otakon: burnt on the outside, or burnt the whole way through?
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Bai pony_148
<otakon> pony_801122: well welcome :) and please make sure to read the rules
<pony_801122> ok
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So cutting the RP will get Maid Hour back faster :)
<Ascendant> Change it first, save, and then test it actually
<Saturn> 8,1superretroworld: they were pork, so no
<superretroworld> Ponies47: FUCK YEAH SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Fuck yeah SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE
<otakon> Saturn: cooked through, slightly burnt outside
<Ponies47> Bye bye bye pony_148 guy stay outta my shed ok?
<HyperMetalLugia> pretty simple, I just need it to do love-unstable ~/desktop/mari0_1.6.love and then kill Cinnamon and restart it
<Cobellanez> Then what exactly IS maid hour Nittany_Discor?
<Saturn> 8,1otakon: what temperature inside?
<Om> I'm okay with less rp.
<RainBroDash> 10^
<Ascendant> just put those commands onto a new line?
<OmegaMaidtroidBrony> Pork you say Saturn... could be a chance of Tapeworms
<otakon> Saturn: no idea, but the blood was cooked clear. This happened like 7 years ago
<Obsidian> no more stream tonight?
<FlareChaserxOctavia> Octavia~<3
<panda> Nittany_Discord: oh..i see
<otakon> Obsidian: no idea, someone might pick it up
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord: i was unaware maid hour was on hiatus, i'll stop now
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't know *how* to kill a process from terminal
<HyperMetalLugia> tried to figure it out, but nope
<Ascendant> kill pid
<Woodenfan> ok sooooo
<WindWhistler|Games> Man, Ristar is fun
<Ascendant> or you can use killall process-name
<Kyubree> 07I'll do it when I have time
<Saturn> 8,1otakon: aye. when cooking a whole roast like that, it's generally a good idea to check the internal temperature with a food thermometer
<otakon> Chrysalis: it's just that people are RPing too much when it happens
<Woodenfan> oh that works, hi everyone
<Ascendant> and you'll need sudo most likely
<Ascendant> lol okay
<WindWhistler|Games> But for some reason, it creeps me out a bit...
<Cobellanez> Hey Woodenfan
<otakon> hello Woodenfan
<Ascendant> it does need fixing though
<OmegaMetroidBrony> Oh hai Woodenfan
<Kyubree> 07I actually have work I need to do for the next couple weeks lol

<CupcakeWarrior> Ohai WindWhistler|Games

<Ascendant> Well
<drf-Droid> >Angry Birds underwear
<Kyubree> 07what I do know is that the code is right on the shadow lugia theme
<drf-Droid> this fad is a bit obnoxious
<Ascendant> It won't hurt anything, Kyu
*Saturn 8,1nuzzles Wrek
<Ascendant> Ah
<WindWhistler|Games> Anyways, what's with these classic games and this unsettling feeling they bring me?
<Saturn> 8,1night night
<otakon> night Chrysalis sleep well man!
<Ascendant> Well I was on the Ho-Oh theme
<Kyubree> 07but changing it to the one you told me to on the other themes didn't work

<CeilingKirz> 1,3food, then zombies
<superretroworld> night Chrysalis
<WindWhistler|Games> I experienced the same feeling while playing Ristar
<Ponies47> My bro is weird he buys like 2 of each game system
<WindWhistler|Games> WallDives: I don't think that's it.
<Woodenfan> Ponies47: yeah i am
<otakon> WallDives: hell yes I have, great RPG. So glad it came out cheap on the next gens. Missed it's first release
<Cypresswolf> O_O 8:30? great...now I'll be up all night
<WindWhistler|Games> I dunno, but I get the impression the classic games are darker in a subtle way...
<Cobellanez> Zombie, yay~!
<Woodenfan> is there a commands page that lets me see all the different commands you can do?
<GilDash> Wrek: Night. :)
<WallDives> WindWhistler|Games: outside of having a crap childhood (guilty), then I dont know...

<MrPoniator> Mega Man X was my first game ever
<MahBoi777> so awesome
<CupcakeWarrior> My first game was Pokemon Yellow
<Octavias_Pride> *nods silently*
<Ninjazz> Mine was Doom.
<CupcakeWarrior> Actually, it might have been Super Mario World
<CrimsonPhoenix> My first game ever was a tank game on atari
<Dermathil> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<MahBoi777> good times
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My first game was Super Mario Bros / Duck Hunt.
<DaringDude> Satan is my motor!
<Ninjazz> I poured milk all over my Super Nintendo when my dad was playing Super Mario World. :$
<Dermathil> I wasn't warned SRW was being streamed again!!!

<PartyCannon> Nittany_Discord true dat
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica: Red Bull overdose?
<MahBoi777> DaringDude: lolwut
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, I can't even get 1 games in 1 these days
<Ninjazz> Sumica: Obviously getting hit with a Red Bull Can.
<DaringDude> song Xd
<Sumica> 00,10seems legit, and i do ahve like 3 cases of it from work
<MrPoniator> I drank 15 red bulls the other weekend
<MahBoi777> OH
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<CupcakeWarrior> I saw you there Lyra
<Dermathil> Stage 58?
<Sumica> 00,10bartenders always gave me a can
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Unless you buy the DLC.
<MrPoniator> It's like soda for me, really
<Dermathil> LELOUCH
<MahBoi777> dayum
<Midnight_Tempest> i would like to see the Mecha from Xenosaga in this game... that would be awesome
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nittany_Discord: http://derpy.me/dMzzk
<DaringDude> MrPoniator: thats not healthy
<Spell-of-Gaming> My first handheld was... a bootleg from China. .-.
<MahBoi777> so much red bull
<VioletGreySha> My first game was maniac mansion on C64
<Sumica> 00,10I never drak them unless I am dea tired
<CECtheRonin> So I finally read Rainbow Factory.
<otakon> When did LeLouch get a battleship?
<MrPoniator> I know, but I wanted to stay awake
<Suinide> Fuck i feel like a retard
<Ninjazz> CECtheRonin: Regret it?
*PartyCannon has never had Red Bull
<CrimsonPhoenix> CECtheRonin: from AuroraDawn?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01This is why you avoid EA, THQ, or Capcom titles with their damn on-disc DLC.
<MrPoniator> And they had free red bull at the venue I was in
<DaringDude> CECtheRonin: really i heard it was kinda sad
<otakon> PartyCannon: it's tangy
<MrPoniator> So why not?
<Sumica> 00,10halfway through R2 otakon
<Dermathil> otakon: around episode 13 season 2?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I love how China is pretty rich but they continue to make bootlegs. :I
<otakon> Dermathil: I meant in game here
<CECtheRonin> DaringDude No, it was really stupid.
<Dermathil> otakon: Halfway through?
<MahBoi777> MrPoniator: lol seize the opportunity
<CECtheRonin> CrimsonPhoenix I think so.
<Caramel> 2,14 he has it in the beginning
<CrimsonPhoenix> Link
<CrimsonPhoenix> in PM
<Ninjazz> I haven't had Red Bull yet. They say that it tasts just like beer...
<Caramel> 2,14 and at one point he breaks into his separate unit
<GabeMoist> Spell-of-Gaming. IIRC, they've bootlegged entire companies
<DaringDude> CECtheRonin: never read it so i wouldnt know... dont plan to either :D
<MrPoniator> It doesn't
<Caramel> 2,14 if you don't take his command unit out, he assumes control of the battleship
<CECtheRonin> Ninjazz Kind of. That's a few minutes of my life I'll never get bacik.
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: I tasted it once, hated it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rainbow Factory is meh.
<MahBoi777> spit it back out
<DaringDude> dat penetration
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RBD Present's interpretation is many times better.
<Dermathil> btw Caramel. I started a new game of SRW J. I'm getting Tekkaman Blade right now.
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I enoyed Rainbow Factory
<MrPoniator> I can't exactly describe how it tastes like, but it's closer to a soda than beer
<otakon> ^
<CrimsonPhoenix> better than Cupcakes
<MrPoniator> Tekkaman Blade is a cool fellow
<otakon> BIG O!
<DaringDude> Nittany_Discord: my thought exactlty :D
<Kimori> why?
<Dermathil> BIG O
<CECtheRonin> Nittany_Discord Yeah, you can't even say it was well-written, like Cupcakes.
<otakon> AND ACTION!
<Sumica> 00,10SHOWTIME
<Ninjazz> Fucking screw Cupcakes. :|
<Suinide> I dunno
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RF is better written.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3sleepy time, have a good night everypony :)
<DaringDude> ^
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: imagine salt mixed with pickle juice with a sweaty sock dipped in
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Night kirz
<MrPoniator> Cupcakes, Cheerilee's Garden, and the like
<DaringDude> Ninjazz: pinkie is still best pony
<otakon> night kirzstryfe sleep well
<Ninjazz> MahBoi777: Ohh god...
<GabeMoist> G'night Capt Kirz
<CupcakeWarrior> I love how I dont recognize anyone in this game except Renton and Simon
<Ninjazz> Night kirzstryfe!
<Suinide> The fact that im talking about this and should have know youd shoot me down hard
<Ninjazz> Take care.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Cupcakes is beyond overrated
<MahBoi777> gnight kirzstryfe
<Suinide> *crashes like a lil plane*
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BIG O!?
<Suinide> :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's just gore, oh my
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: FOR SHAME!
<Ninjazz> DaringDude: I love her to death too, but Rarity.
<MrPoniator> The biggest problem I've with them is that the characters go to bit extremes or otherwise turn out to be such nutjobs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Cheerilee's Garden?
<Ninjazz> NO
<CrimsonPhoenix> but the writing was horrible
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the puns oh god why
<Dermathil> otakon: I saw the first episode myself. Never got to watch the other episodes.
<Sumica> 00,10all dem lockons
<Spell-of-Gaming> Grimdark Pony Fanfics > Screamers
<GabeMoist> CupcakeWarrior, not even Viral?
<CECtheRonin> otakon I've never seen Big O either.
<CupcakeWarrior> GabeMoist: Hes in this game?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh wait, it's the other around
<MahBoi777> DaringDude: /)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Never heard of Cheerilee's Garden.
<otakon> Dermathil: argh, you of all people would probably like it
<MrPoniator> I like Prince Charming the best from that type of fics, but the second part was pretty stupid, and maybe the end of the first in a few ways
<Dermathil> IKR
<Kimori> shoot you down hard?
<Ninjazz> One of the few good Grimdarks I like is Solar Flare.
<GabeMoist> CupcakeWarrior, he was with Simon
<Kosoveon> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Kosoveon, you are a 10Drowzee.
<Kosoveon> LOL NO
<DaringDude> (\
<Sumica> 00,10spacial bullets, that's just evil
<MrPoniator> Cheerilee's Garden is SAW meets ponies, really
<MrPoniator> Except, no escape for the victims
<junh1024-XD> its your DESTINY!
<MahBoi777> oh my
<Dermathil> SEND 00RAISER
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Best Grimdark I've read so far is Silent Ponyville.
<otakon> SHENLOGN!
<Ninjazz> MrPoniator: Thanks for the warning... Not going to touch that... -_-
<CrimsonPhoenix> You guys want something
<Sumica> 00,10claw rape
<CrimsonPhoenix> creepy?
<Ninjazz> Nittany_Discord: It's one of the better ones, indeed.
<otakon> Sumica: it's nothing on Granzon
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://tinycartridge.com/post/866743831/super-creepy-pokemon-hack
<Dermathil> I heard Gundam Seed is terribad
<Bluestrom_S> good night everyone
<MahBoi777> DIDNEY WURLD
<CupcakeWarrior> CrimsonPhoenix: I remember that
<Sumica> 00,10macross quarter!
<otakon> night Bluestrom_S sleep well
<MrPoniator> For the most part it's just a gore fest that gets a bit too boring after a while, despite some of the situations being rather intriguing
<Dermathil> MACROSS ATTACK
<Ninjazz> Gnight Bluestrom_S. Take care.
<Dermathil> lol lyra
<CECtheRonin> It feels weird being an ME3 fan right now.
<MahBoi777> gnight Bluestrom_S
<PartyCannon> Shiny
<Ninjazz> That thing is huge...
<Dermathil> BTW guys, this is a PSP game
<MrPoniator> But the ending of the second part of Cheerilee's Garden was pretty well set-up, which for me justifies the time it took to read it
<Ninjazz> Awesome music too.
<Suinide> Lol
<Sumica> 00,10it is a command ship
<PartyCannon> SHINY
<CrimsonPhoenix> Then CupcakeWarrior can you vouche me on how creepy it is?
<CupcakeWarrior> CrimsonPhoenix: Not very imo
<CrimsonPhoenix> well dang
<Suinide> I kinda wanted to flirt with you, but im an idiot for thinking youd want to
<Ninjazz> MrPoniator: What could possibly justify pointless slash and gore?
<MrPoniator> Well, that Macross isn't as big as the colony ones :p
<Cobellanez> Goodnight everyone
<Dermathil> GETTER ROBO
*Dermathil sings along Heats
<CupcakeWarrior> CrimsonPhoenix: But the polemon creepypastas are my favorite creepypastas

<Ninjazz> Night Cobellanez. Take care.
<Sumica> 00,10getter axe
<CupcakeWarrior> pokemon*
<MrPoniator> Ninjazz, I like Shakespeare tragedies
<Kimori> >.>
<Ninjazz> Ahhh. I see.
<MrPoniator> And Cheerilee's garden used that pretty well in its ending
<Kimori> oh umm
<Kimori> yeah I wasnt expecting that
<Ninjazz> I guess I could give it a chance...
<Dermathil> HEATS is among the best songs there is
<Ninjazz> Better than Cupcakes?
<MrPoniator> And since that part didn't even involve gore or so
<MahBoi777> hmmmmm
<Suinide> Lol yeah
<Dermathil> MAP ATTACK
<Suinide> Thats why im an idiot :C
<MrPoniator> better than cupcakes, just prepare for more gore
<Sumica> 00,10NBE missles
*Ninjazz sighs
<Kimori> :/
<CupcakeWarrior> Id much rather read clopfics than gore
<Dermathil> I read neither
<MahBoi777> Ninjazz: challenge accepted? lol
<Ninjazz> Alright... I suppose I should atleast try that one out before I decide to burn it.
<MrPoniator> But yeah, it's really the ending that's the only neat part of it, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone
<Suinide> Sorry
<MrPoniator> Unless you've hots for gore or something
<Suinide> Ill run away now
*Nittany_Discord 11,01goes to read Cheerilee's Garden.

<Suinide> Bye
<CupcakeWarrior> Yep
<Dermathil> NO KALLEN
<Ninjazz> I think so...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It has to be as bad or worse than Sweet Apple Masssacre to even start to bother me, and SAM was just blatant sex/gore/stupid.
<Sumica> 00,10those red guys have cool attacks
<otakon> oh crap that is GONNA HEART
<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah so that dude died?
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah

<junh1024-XD> yes
<otakon> ouch

<Caramel> 2,14 they're experimental dimensional beasts
<drfsupercenter> 03since >no school Friday
<drfsupercenter> 03and I want to go home
<drfsupercenter> 03if I do, though
<Tovler> oh. Samurai cop got insta WMC'd, so I thought- yeah.
<Dermathil> Dimensional Beasts are assholes,.
<Caramel> 2,14 designed to take revenge on Zexis for fucking up their boss
<Sumica> 00,10pinkie monsters, got it
<drfsupercenter> 03I could play that song or efven Staying Alive
<drfsupercenter> 03-f
<drfsupercenter> 03the irony :P
<MrPoniator> I like how those basic enemies rip a hole to the space time continuum, and yet, only do like 1k damage
<otakon> oh lovely Dimensional Beasts
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Samurai Cop is porn.
<otakon> THEY SHATTER THE FOURTH WALL!
<junh1024-XD> ohohoho
<MahBoi777> Lol how weak
<Dermathil> SUZAKU GO
<Ninjazz> I hate how famous stupid fan fics get to the point where people actually redo them.
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: you're kidding right?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Porn is instant WMC.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We screened it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's pretty much a porn flick.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it's realy pointless porn too
<Ninjazz> But that's the best kind! D:
<Octavias_Pride> ......well then......
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica: Most porns are pointless
<PartyCannon> I figured it was gonna be a C
<Sumica> 00,10Dont get me wrong she had a nice rack but yeah. Full frontal
<Dermathil> Ninjazz, Not when there are 13 year olds attending the BMNs.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know we've seen worse, but rated X is not allowed.
<PartyCannon> Sumica lol
<Shizuka> 13we DO have standards
<Sumica> 00,10eh it's no X raited
<Tovler> like skinemax quality?
<Ninjazz> Dermathil: I was just joking... and I forgot about that...
<otakon> Shizuka: we know that!
<PartyCannon> It's R, but very strong sexual content
<otakon> wow, so what's the B movie again?
<Ninjazz> Lol Shizuka
<Sumica> 00,10just lots of clothing on rubbing
<Dermathil> yeah. NEVER FORGET the 13 year olds.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think Reqiuem/Evil Dead will be the most "adult" movie set we'll ever show.
<Sumica> 00,10but still not fitting
<Caramel> 2,14 the only sexual content we allow is the boob physics from this game >: (
<otakon> Caramel: indeed!
<MrPoniator> lol
<MrPoniator> Why are you showing my videos, then?
<Ninjazz> I doubt that... >_>
<Vordox> So the movie will be replaced with..what?
<MahBoi777> shield ur eyez children
<otakon> MrPoniator: that doesn't count!
<Tovler> It's even worse than The Room?
<Sumica> 00,10you should change your colors if you are gonna be Caramel =p
<Sumica> 00,10dat polandamy
<otakon> Man, I was looking forward to Samurai Cop too, sounded campy.
<Dermathil> GOOOOOOOOOO
<Shizuka> 13we'll try to get a hold of the idio--I MEAN wonderful viewer that voted for it and get a repick
<Shizuka> 13otherwise we'll see
<otakon> Too bad it's just a skinflick
<Ninjazz> Aye, otakon.
<Caramel> 7,8 Luna doesn't like me using her colors :P
<otakon> OUCH MY EYES!
<PartyCannon> :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Rob Zombie's Halloween with the most "pornographic" thing we'll ever show (though I doubt we'll see it again).
<CupcakeWarrior> Shizuka: That was chosen for this weekend?
*Ninjazz cringes
<Vordox> And who was the winner Shizuka ?
<otakon> Caramel: BLUE ON YELLOW DAMMIT!
<Dermathil> Caramel, you need MORE TRANS AM
<otakon> Nittany_Discord: that crappy movie should have been WMC'd
<MrPoniator> What movies are planned for next friday, if any?
<otakon> THE HELL!?
<Ninjazz> Didn't we show a girl get raped by a tree in Evil Dead?
<Dermathil> GETTER BEAMU
<Shizuka> 13A movie this week is Footloose
<otakon> he's riding a GIANT DRAGON!?
<Ninjazz> I mean Fluttershy.
<Sumica> 00,10it might have been an ok movie if it did't have the pointless sex bits
<Tovler> Not WMC, but Halloween was by no means an A movie.
<Dermathil> otakon: that's a getter ship.
<Vordox> I still find Footloose to NOT be an A movie, hardly even close to a B :p
<CupcakeWarrior> mfw Ive never seen Footloose yet
<otakon> Ninjazz: yeah, but hey just show it poking her in thr crotch.
<Petrified_Discord> Ohai bronystate. Ohai giant robots. :)
<otakon> Tovler: Halloween 07 was crap
<otakon> hiya Petrified_Discord
<Ninjazz> otakon: Still... Rape, man.
<Sumica> 00,10cause caht would have had fun with samerai cop
<Dermathil> Dancouga GO
<otakon> Ninjazz: aye
<sub06905> how about we just skip past the sex bits?
<Sumica> 00,10chat*
<MrPoniator> Really wish there were more epic-tier mecha games
<otakon> sub06905: we can't
<PartyCannon> Sumica I thought about some... things that would be said
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did Samurai Cop have a plot, or was it just a porno?
<otakon> sub06905: don't know where they are at
<Ninjazz> MrPoniator: We got some dance movie called Footloose coming.
<MrPoniator> I like Zone of the Enders, but there's not enough content or gameplay
<Vordox> MrPoniator: There's something called Force now that's pretty wicked MEcha game
<Dermathil> Dat Lyra jumping out of the explosion
<Shizuka> 13from what i read, the "plot" is just an excuse to get from pointless sex scene to pointless sex scene
<Sumica> 00,10not sure I would have to watch in real time to know of any thing besides chipmunk voices
<Tovler> I was hoping it was Footloose 2011. I kinda want to see that.
<MrPoniator> What was that one FPS with a mech thing going on
<MrPoniator> By some pretty small team too
<Kandarihu> I gotta know. Is this the last stage or what?
<Dermathil> Another Century's Episode?
<PartyCannon> Shizuka so basically, like a porno
<Shizuka> 13eeeyup
<sub06905> we should watch Arthur
<Ninjazz> MrPoniator: I think I know what you're talking about... Mecah Assault I think.
<Sumica> 00,10softcore at best
<Polydunami> I see robots!
<Ninjazz> Mecha*
<MrPoniator> I don't think it was that
<otakon> MrPoniator: Section 8?
<Ninjazz> Hey Polydunami!
<Polydunami> Also, hey there everypony! n_n
<CupcakeWarrior> Hi Polydunami, its Shizuka's birthday today
<otakon> Sumica: it's Skinemax material
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I don't feel like watching pointless sex (or sex at all).
<otakon> hiya Polydunami
<MahBoi777> hey Polydunami!
<MrPoniator> Nah, not that one either
<Octavias_Pride> watermelon is best melon
<Dermathil> Nittany_Discord: Don't forget to think about the 13 year olds!
<Polydunami> Hey Shizuka!
<Ninjazz> MrPoniator: When was it made?
<Polydunami> Happy birthday!
<Sumica> 00,10there was never penetration so realy it would not rate skinamax
<Tovler> I'm partial to Honeydew myself
<otakon> MrPoniator: there are no other recent FPS that have you playing in a giant mech suit
<MrPoniator> I believe it's still in the works
<Dermathil> GODMARS
<DaringDude> Wait so if a man had the tip of his ummm thing cut off and he had sex.. would it be pointless sex?
<Sumica> 00,10perhaps late night comidy central or scifi
<CupcakeWarrior> Dammit DaringDude
<MrPoniator> They posted gameplay footage last year at least
<otakon> Sumica: there is none of that in a skinemax. although lots of dry humping I'm afraid
<Shizuka> 13<3
<DaringDude> XD
<Petrified_Discord> Wait, whose birthday is it?
<Shizuka> 13all the wub
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We had 13-year-olds watch Requiem.
<MahBoi777> Lol DaringDude
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope they learned from it.
<sub06905> lol dry humping
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We did warn them, though.
<otakon> MrPoniator: Steel Battalion? That is gonna suck
<Polydunami> So we have some Caramel robots again? I'm okay with that :3
*Rain hugs Shizuka

<Dermathil> Or is it SEED Destiny that is in here...?
<otakon> MrPoniator: eeyup, and it's coming back as a KINECT ONLY title
<MrPoniator> Huh
<Ninjazz> :|
<MrPoniator> I've missed that memo
<Petrified_Discord> Shizuka: http://derpy.me/0oIZU
<Dermathil> HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFACE
<Dermathil> also, YES
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: It makes the game way cheaper, at least
<otakon> MrPoniator: the first Steel Battalion was GREAT! It had a HUGE FRIGGIN CONTROLLER.
<Shizuka> 13awww <3
<MrPoniator> yeah, I know
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: But of course the controls will suck, being on Kinect
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: you still need to buy a 180$ KINECT to play it, so no.
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/MPNaw.jpg <- So this comes as a result of my boredom :P
*drfsupercenter runs
<MrPoniator> I've been intrigued to get the game just because of the controller
<Polydunami> Rainbow Dash is... pretty cool, I guess
*Shizuka 13is tearing up, so used to being ignored on her birthday
<Shizuka> 13<3
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: the original release of Steel Battalion was cheaper
<Dermathil> HAPPY BIRTHDAY SHIZUKA
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I know there was only one female character, so sue me
<MahBoi777> lol
<Dermathil> SIMON
*otakon hugs Shizuka "You could NEVER be ignored here dear!"
<Polydunami> Wait, it's the 22nd for you. Is that your birthday?
<MahBoi777> NEVA
<CupcakeWarrior> Doesnt Steel Battalion erase your saxe when you die?
<CupcakeWarrior> save*
<MrPoniator> Yep
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know what I could get Shizuka.
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: eeyup, so you have to remember to eject.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Sumica: u still there or u asleep
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: and there is even a self destruct switch
<MrPoniator> Oh yeah
<Ninjazz> He'll be back in a bit, Shane.
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: it goddamn rocked
<MrPoniator> The game I was thinking about was Hawken
*Phase4 hugs Shizuka
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane glomps Shizuka
<CupcakeWarrior> I wish I had an original Xbox
<Shizuka> 13oo hawken looks awesome
<Shizuka> 13like tribes but with mechs
<sub06905> we should watch Nothing To Lose :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> sub06905: is that a movie?
<otakon> MrPoniator: Hawken is PC, and not even out until next year, the beta is coming in six months though.
<Dermathil> Shizuka: My nametag is already registered for Hawken.
<MrPoniator> Though, I wish Hawken used the mech aspect more creatively
<sub06905> yup
<otakon> Shizuka: same here
<Dermathil> otakon: 12/12/12 MY BOY
<Dermathil> THIS YEAR
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> thx to Sumica i got the Code Lyoko song stuck in my head again :$
<Polydunami> I actually had an original Xbox.
<Shizuka> 13HERE WE ARE
<Shizuka> 13GOING FAR
<Shizuka> 13TO SAVE AAAALL THAT WE LOVE
<CrimsonPhoenix> sub06905: Suggest it in the lottery at the next newsletter
<otakon> Dermathil: lol yeah right, I BET you it gets pushed back.
<Shizuka> 13you're welcome :3
<MrPoniator> At the moment you could just replace the HUD with a typical FPS and gun, it wouldn't look much different
<otakon> lol Shizuka
<sub06905> Nothing To Lose: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119807/
<MrPoniator> Other than looking more like Tribes
<CupcakeWarrior> Apparently people found out that the mayan calendar doesnt end this year
<junh1024-XD> sosumi
<Dermathil> otakon: pretty sure it won't. The closed beta starts then
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Caramel: do u double screen?
<Dermathil> TIERIA GO
<CrimsonPhoenix> sub06905: Suggest it in the lottery at the next newsletter

<Aurora> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03YEs
<drfsupercenter> 03and well
<otakon> um, that Gundam has a FACE ON ITS BACK
<MrPoniator> But yeah, something like Zone of the Enders, but with more content and all would be nice
<drfsupercenter> 03only a few make sense
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm the hulk because... yeah that should be obvious
<Dermathil> otakon: TWO-IN-ONE DEAL
<otakon> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03I let Chimera be Iron Man because that's like his favorite superhero ever
<Shizuka> 13two monitors i think he means
<CupcakeWarrior> Ah, there is my lottery link :)
<Aurora> green text
<Polydunami> On December 21st, we blare air raid sirens as a mockery of the 2012 fiasco >:3
<Dermathil> the mech can separate into TWO
<drfsupercenter> 03and Aurora got to be the female character because >female

<drfsupercenter> 03who has no pwoers
<drfsupercenter> 03:D
<CrimsonPhoenix> having two monitors is awesome
*Petrified_Discord feels this chat should have significantly more cake
<otakon> dat Amuro Ray
<drfsupercenter> 03no but that's because he's the um
<Aurora> hawkeye
<drfsupercenter> 03least manly of the 3
<Caramel> 2,14 no, I stream from a laptop
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<MrPoniator> I like some Gundam VS arcade game I played the other day, and it was pretty cool
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane magically creates Shizuka a birthday cookie
<Aurora> he has powers :<
<Ninjazz> In the end, people just want giant fighting robots so I'm not sure how you'd get a good robot game going.
<junh1024-XD> what powers do i have?
<MahBoi777> needs moar cake!
<otakon> oh crap, no that's TETSUJIN 28!
<drfsupercenter> 03Captain America is a super soldier really
<Aurora> captain AMERKA
<drfsupercenter> 03and wait what
<Tovler> Too late, I already turned in my survey, which will lose.
<otakon> aka GIGANTOR!
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: yup, and the other one can operate seperately... like a mobile doll
<drfsupercenter> 03since when does Hawkeye have powers
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Caramel: so how r u playing at typing at the same time?
<MrPoniator> Only if it was expanded little more than just small deathmatches in closed areas
<drfsupercenter> 03he just shoots arrows
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: nice
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> and* not at
<Aurora> hawkeye has ridiculous eyesight/accuracy :>
<drfsupercenter> 03I questioned why he even got to be part of the team until I saw the movie XD
<Ninjazz> Aye.
<Caramel> 2,14 it's not running fullscreen
<drfsupercenter> 03OK fine
<otakon> GO TETSUJIN!
<Aurora> it's nothng special
<Polydunami> Wow, Gundam?
<Octavias_Pride> anyone else phsyched for the return of Toonami?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Caramel: ;p; k
<Aurora> but it is a power
<drfsupercenter> 03supposedly both he and Black Widow do have powers in the comicx
<drfsupercenter> 03s
<Dermathil> This is NOT a gundam
*Petrified_Discord gives chat cake
<Polydunami> Oh.
<MahBoi777> Octavias_Pride: HELL YEA
<drfsupercenter> 03lik eshe's supposed to be really old or something
<Dermathil> Tetsujin 28
<drfsupercenter> 03and not aging as much
<Ninjazz> Octavias_Pride: I'll have you know that I AM!
<otakon> Polydunami: no, the ORIGINAL giant robot, the granddaddy of them all, TETSUJIN 28
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> imma kinda physced that code lyoko is running for a 5th season
<Polydunami> I see
<Dermathil> But there ARE gundams around
<otakon> damn, just SHORT of killing them
<MrPoniator> lol, 10
<otakon> and HA Iron Will for the win!
<Dermathil> DAI-GUARD!!!!
<drfsupercenter> 03also that picture is about as artistic as I get :P
<Dermathil> KNOT-PUNISHER ATTACK
<Aurora> I'm not even
<MrPoniator> Is that even supposed to hurt?
<Tovler> I became a Toonami hater before it got cancelled. I don't wanna seem like a hypocrite.
<Aurora> not even sure how to handle this picture lmao
<Shizuka> 13see now that everyone's seen some of lyoko, they'll recognize what my picture was inspired by http://i.imgur.com/it7Wi.jpg
<otakon> MrPoniator: some pilots have skills that when used reduce all incoming damage to 10
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<drfsupercenter> 03I was just having fun
<MrPoniator> Yeah, but still
<Aurora> cuz admittedly, it's true OTL
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Shizuka: *gasps*
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Petrified_Discord> I still think it's hilarious how they did Toonami as an April Fools thing and were surprised wheneveryone was like "YES! That's what we wanted!"
<drfsupercenter> 03It was like
<otakon> MrPoniator: it does hurt however
<Caramel> 2,14 which I use against people I know are going to violate my anus
<drfsupercenter> 03ordinarily we don't all side together like that
<drfsupercenter> 03so I thought that was worth noting XD
<Aurora> I live a frustrating life
<Shizuka> 13someone drew that for me in high school
<MrPoniator> More like tickle?
<drfsupercenter> 03you get to interrogate people all day?
<Ninjazz> ... Whoa ...
<Aurora> I don't care of other's opinions, but once someone doesn't tolerate someone else, I don't tolerate said intolerant person
<otakon> Caramel: well, after seeing what these guys can do I'm not surprised, they look like anus destroyers for sure.
<Aurora> I basically am the definition of hypocritical
<Petrified_Discord> Orange!
<MahBoi777> Petrified_Discord: Ikr? they need to open their eyes lol
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i use to watch code lyoko like 5, 6 years ago
<Aurora> HOLY CRAP
<otakon> the hell kind of mech is that?
<Aurora> THAT IS WEED
<Dermathil> ORANGE KUN IN THE SUTHERLAND KRIEG
<Ninjazz> I didn't know Code Lyoko was so popular.. My friends hated it. :$
<Aurora> WHY ARE YOU SMOKING IT AGAIN
<drfsupercenter> 03Everybody's a hypocrite in its own regard
<drfsupercenter> 03wait what
<Caramel> 2,14 and they're the trash mobs of this level
*Aurora shuts window
<Ninjazz> I liked it though.
<drfsupercenter> 03er
<Petrified_Discord> Memorize THIS!
<drfsupercenter> 03in their own regard, I mean
<Caramel> 2,14 I haven't even triggered the round 2 reinforcements
<otakon> Caramel: oh god,the boss THE BOSS
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> brb coca runner shootign time
<otakon> Caramel: wait..........THIS IS ROUND ONE?!
<Dermathil> Oh so I got here THAT early have I Caramel?
<Dermathil> yes otakon.
<Petrified_Discord> Just have Lelouche unlock the fleija and we can go home :)
<Octavias_Pride> haven't seen code lyoko since cartoon network ran it.....and it's still going on?
<MrPoniator> Why hello there, little guy!
<Aurora> SOMEONE directly near my apartment
<Aurora> smokes weed
<Caramel> 2,14 yes Dermathil, and you should consider yourself lucky I didn't decide to just finish it on my own after yesterday
<otakon> he's so cute...............
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<drfsupercenter> 03that sucks
<Aurora> all the time
<drfsupercenter> 03we had this kid who did in my dorm
<Ninjazz> lol
<otakon> and then he wrecks their shit
<MahBoi777> awwwwwww
<Aurora> and it wafts into my room
<Dermathil> GRRR
<drfsupercenter> 03and he made the halls smell like it
<Dermathil> you better not do that
<Shizuka> 13Octavias_Pride: season 4 was the end but there's a rumored fifth season coming now
<Dermathil> I WANT TO WATCH
<Ninjazz> He's damn fast too! :O
<Shizuka> 13some four years after
<Aurora> it's either the people next to me, under me, or kitty corner
<Caramel> 2,14 then don't bitch about the things I stream
<Aurora> it's too strong to be any further
<MrPoniator> And doesn't even change his facial expression
<otakon> Seriously, it's a VOTOM that is basically the lowest tech mech there besides Boss Borot
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Shizuka: code lyoko season 5 is coming out in oct
<Dermathil> I had merely expressed my distaste for the show before leaving.
<Octavias_Pride> ah.....if I remember right, season four ended with Xana's manifestation, yes?
<Polydunami> So... who is this Kiriko or whoever that is?
<otakon> it's basically a exoskeleton with big guns
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Shizuka: its not rumored its actually happening
<MahBoi777> no complaints plz
<Aurora> in other news
<otakon> MAZINGER Z!
<Caramel> 2,14 yeah, and it's incredibly rude
<Aurora> it is 10:30 I NEED TO FINISH MY ROOM
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
*Petrified_Discord complains about complaints
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah I actually made my humanities teacher laugh today
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Shizuka: but their live actioning the the parts that arent in the virtual world?
<Ninjazz> Xana got manifested?! :O
<drfsupercenter> 03she was like, what's this author trying to convey
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Caramel: whats rude?
<Aurora> btw
<Tovler> Next, you'll be telling me that Boondocks Season 4 is happening.
<drfsupercenter> 03some kid goes "He's saying not to be a hypocrite"
<Aurora> who's nick fury
<DaringDude> ............
<otakon> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: complaining about what's on the stream
<Aurora> he doens't have anyone's name
<MrPoniator> They hit the skybox's limits
<drfsupercenter> 03and then she goes on about how the author IS a hypocrite
<Aurora> :<
<MrPoniator> Ow
<Shizuka> 13http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Code_Lyoko_Evolution_logo.jpg is it me or are they borrowing heavily from tron legacy >>
<otakon> Tovler: if only man, if only
<drfsupercenter> 03and I'm like "Everybody'sa hypocrite in their own regard"
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> OctaviaIsBestPony: probs i havent seen it since 2008
<drfsupercenter> 03she LOL'd like "True"
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Caramel: i have to say this
<drfsupercenter> 03and well
<MahBoi777> Petrified_Discord: Lol u shud have been here yesterday
<drfsupercenter> 03for one, Nick Fury isn't an actual Avenger
<Aurora> yeah but I'm a rather obnoxious case of it lol
<DaringDude> dis music
<drfsupercenter> 03and two, we don't have any black people
*drfsupercenter runs
<Aurora> that you know of :<
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> TO THE PEOPLE WHO DONT LIKE WATS BEING STREAMING SHUT THE BUCK UP!
<otakon> Eh, need mor Baram Doban
<DaringDude> oh nd this guy owns
<Ninjazz> Indeed, Shizuka.
<drfsupercenter> 03nah but mainly because he's not one of the 6
<otakon> or Time to Come
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> THE STREAMERS WILL STREAMER WHAT EVER THEY LIKE
<Shizuka> 13unknown if an english version will be produced, bummer
<drfsupercenter> 03the only put him in the poster, because he's (as I quote), Samuel L. Motherf***ing Jackson
<otakon> or hell, Blade that Cleaves Evil
<Polydunami> Alicorn_Prince_Shane, do you need to stick up for the streamers?
<otakon> or TROMBE!
<MahBoi777> calm down Alicorn_Prince_Shane lol
<DaringDude> bewm
<PartyCannon> I don't like that it's live action now
<Aurora> he's still got a rather big part thogh
<Dermathil> Shizuka: If they don't, then find the subbed version. They're better anyway
<Aurora> though
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Polydunami: well im sick of the shit streamers get
<Octavias_Pride> Alicorn_Prince_Shane : exactly
<drfsupercenter> 03true
<Shizuka> 13unless they have new characters it just won't be right without sharon mann heading aelita and jeremie
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Aurora> he doesn't do any fighting normally. but he's still technically an avenger I believe
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> streamers srs get so much shit from people
<Aurora> mainly, the head of it
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't think anyone else was involved in that discussion on either night
<Tovler> almost 2 weeks until everyone laughs at the Wii U again.
<drfsupercenter> 03or else I'd add thenm
<drfsupercenter> 03*them
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> its ridicoulous
<Polydunami> I'm not one to complain about the streamers myself
<Ninjazz> That's funny coming from you, Shane. :$
<otakon> Dermathil: why did you freak over CL anyway? and calmly please.
<MahBoi777> me neither
<Petrified_Discord> loljk http://derpy.me/DDOvK
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: stfu lol
<Polydunami> If I don't get enjoyment from the stream, I'll enjoy the chat itself
<PartyCannon> Tovler not sure if that's a compliment or not
<Ninjazz> hehehe :$
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ninjazz: i ask if they show something yea but i dont complain about the stream
<MahBoi777> random chat is best chat
<Ninjazz> Better not. You'll know what will happen. :|
<Petrified_Discord> MahBoi777: ^
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> SuperBrony64|AFK: is best Cow
<PartyCannon> lol
*Tovler tries to remember if the e3 press conferences were streamed here or not.
<Petrified_Discord> Ohai dragon robot? :O
<otakon> wow, he looks pissed
<Midnight_Tempest> lion...
<MahBoi777> whoa
<Ninjazz> That would be pretty awesome...
<otakon> Petrified_Discord: I think lion
<Midnight_Tempest> Ganleon... lion...
<Phase4> Shizuka, by 'borrowing heavily' you meen 'completly ripping off tron legacy's art style'
<otakon> and ded
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> brb
<Petrified_Discord> Because lions are known for their wings and firebreath. :
<Petrified_Discord> *:D
<Ninjazz> Will BronyState be showing E3? It'd be awesome to see chat's reactions to what Gaben anounces. :D
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Phase4> though i'd still like to see it
<Dermathil> Go Tieria! Kick his ass!
<MahBoi777> Gaben is a baws
<otakon> Ninjazz: it won't happen
<Phase4> Ninjazz, lol, bronystate at e3
<Ninjazz> Damn...
<otakon> HYPER BURST MODE!
<Phase4> that would be epic
<Kriel_Pony> HI Everypony
<Ninjazz> lol Phase4 :D
<Polydunami> Hello Kriel_Pony :3
<MahBoi777> hi Kriel_Pony!
<Petrified_Discord> Just give me my E3 demo of AC3 and I'll be content :)
<Ninjazz> Kriel_Pony... Watch out for Ghosties.
<otakon> hiya Kriel_Pony welcome tot he Super Robot Taisen Power Hour
<panda> Kriel_Pony: :D you're back
<Phase4> ohai Kriel_Pony
<MahBoi777> Lol Petrified_Discord
<Octavias_Pride> that akward moment when you bite into a piece of watermelon only to get nothing but rind.....
<otakon> damn, STILL not enough
<Shizuka> 13http://screensnapr.com/v/LNHGit.png not bad
<Kriel_Pony> Ninjazz: hmmm?
<Ninjazz> Kriel_Pony: Turns out your advice nearly broke his laptop. :(
<Dermathil> Woohoo Dai-Guardo!
<MahBoi777> EPIC ADVICE
<Polydunami> Advice?
<Kriel_Pony> Ninjazz: No way. Combatibility mode literally can't do that.
<otakon> Kriel_Pony: what did you tell Ghosties?
*Petrified_Discord still can't figure out why every AC:MLP crossover has Octavia as an assassin. Is there something I'm missing? 6_9
<Ninjazz> Kriel_Pony: Not sure what happened but man was he PISSED.
*CupcakeWarrior finished voting in the lottery
<otakon> Petrified_Discord: no idea, I guess she just looks better in it is all
<Phase4> Shizuka, so they are ripping of both trons?
<Phase4> :P
<otakon> the Assassin robes I mean
<Kriel_Pony> Ninjazz: I suggested trying to run steam in combatibility mode for his KoTOR mod
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, the lottery
<MahBoi777> Petrified_Discord: your right, it should beFluttershy lol
<PartyCannon> All I'll say about the lotto is that I hope my B movie wins
<Polydunami> ... I'll be right back
<Petrified_Discord> Hidden chello bow perhaps?
<Shizuka> 13it was always pretty heavily related to tron
<Kriel_Pony> I mean, to undo it, you need to click one sincle check box
<Dermathil> Knot punisher arm!
<Ninjazz> Kriel_Pony: I know. He did that. He said his laptop went into fits and had trouble starting back up.
<PartyCannon> eeyup
<CupcakeWarrior> The new Lyoko is live action?
<Petrified_Discord> "Lemme just ARM myself"
<Tovler> I sold out and only picked movies that would make me beloved.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> how do u categorise A movies from B movies?
<Petrified_Discord> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Columns
<Shizuka> 13at least in concept, cause the environments were more natural than tron
<Phase4> fair enough, it just looks a smidge too much like the end of the original tron imho
<Kriel_Pony> Ninjazz: Well that is more likely related to the mod that was already shutting down his PC than anything
<Shizuka> 13and colorful
<Phase4> Alicorn_Prince_Shane, check the faq
<Polydunami> Alicorn_Prince_Shane, http://www.bronystate.net/faq/
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> k
<Dermathil> HAHAHA nice block
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/534171_10151148593798289_36261648288_13498899_541604300_n.jpg
<otakon> GOddammit I like that pan flute in the beginning of this them
<drfsupercenter> 03"Disney" "The Other Disney"
<Phase4> Alicorn_Prince_Shane, ^ Polydunami
<otakon> theme*
<Kriel_Pony> Ninjazz: Hell, I ran compatibility mode on steam on my PC first to make sure it wouldnt cause a problem
<Ninjazz> Kriel_Pony: Indeed. But I advice to watch out for Ghosties when he comes back. He should be calmed down now, so there's that.
<otakon> FIRE ALL OF THE MISSILES
<Ninjazz> Just saying.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> what category would District 9 fall under?
<Shizuka> 13the idea of a second supercalculator with a replika core is a very interesting idea since season 4 established that one replika is equivalent to a quarter of lyoko's capacity
<otakon> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: we've shown it already, A
<Kriel_Pony> Ninjazz: Well, thanks for the heads up. I really was jsut trying to help...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Shizuka: u sure do know ur lyoko /)
<sub06905> one question how do i submit a movie for movie night? 6_9
<otakon> dodgey dodgey
<Shizuka> 13looks like they're keeping the major character designs and environments, so that's good
<Ninjazz> Kriel_Pony: I know, I told him that. I'm sure he understands now. He was just freaking out is all. :)
<drfsupercenter> 03also mfw
<drfsupercenter> 03Hollywood wants to distance itself from its own anti-piracy efforts, by no longer referring to downloaders as thieves
<otakon> and then he took a shot to the crotch
<CupcakeWarrior> Well,
<Polydunami> Well, it looks like our B movie this week was cancelled...?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Shizuka: but in code lyoko their making the non lyoko scenes Live Action
<Tovler> oh, Pandora's Pinata drops today.
<Polydunami> Or replaced?
<otakon> Polydunami: gonna get another one
<CupcakeWarrior> I'm done for the night
<otakon> Polydunami: gonna get replaced
<PartyCannon> Shizuka I think I'll watch an ep, and we'll see~
<Shizuka> 13best of luck to them for casting a live action aelita cause very few people can pull off pink hair well
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Polydunami: y?
<otakon> night CupcakeWarrior sleep well
<Kriel_Pony> Ninjazz: NOW I feel all guilty though...
<Shizuka> 13PartyCannon: find one from season 3 or 4
<panda> um... jiggle?
<otakon> dat boob jiggle
<Aurora> wuh
<Aurora> what are they gonna call em now
<Polydunami> Alicorn_Prince_Shane, the B movie was removed
<PartyCannon> I've seen the whole series :)
<otakon> panda: SRT's are INFAMOUS for jiggle
<panda> otakon: you got ninja'd :D
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Shizuka: i dont remeber but did aelita come into the real world i think she did?
<Shizuka> 13well tehre you go~
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Polydunami: y tho
<otakon> panda: bye milliseconds
<panda> otakon: hehe :D
<Ninjazz> Don't worry about it, Kriel_Pony.

<Shizuka> 13yeah aelita got out at the end of season 1 but xana attached the plot thread to her to keep season 2 running, was pretty weak
<Polydunami> We'll have an update, I guess
<Shizuka> 13by season 3 she was solid out of lyoko and it was established she is originally from reality
<Polydunami> Right, I have to write my ballot. Be right back
<otakon> Shizuka: how are you guys gonna go about picking the new B?
<PartyCannon> Shizuka yeah Franz Hopper was far more interesting
*PartyCannon zips lips
<Shizuka> 13otakon: trying to find the guy that voted it to get a re-pick, otherwise we'll see
<otakon> Shizuka: I just say re-pick from the lottery of last week, you have the records of it somewhere right?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Shizuka: u sure do kno ur lyoko
<Shizuka> 13dunno, i don't run the lottery >>
<Tovler> Footloose is kind of a cult hit B movie. Replace it with Wall-E
<Shizuka> 13Alicorn_Prince_Shane: like i said, i was a major aelita fangirl before asuka
<otakon> Tovler: I second this idea
<Dermathil> Nu Gundam!!!!
<Midnight_Tempest> dem PsyCommu Funnels...
<otakon> good shot
<Shizuka> 13plus i remember stuff about shows a lot... for instance you give me one or two frames from any season 1-3 episode of spongebob i could probably name the ep and start quoting the scene
<otakon> lol Shizuka
<otakon> you ARE a silly filly
<PartyCannon> Shizuka I know that feel
<otakon> I'm the same way with many games sadly
<Shizuka> 13though now it's usually the opposite.. someone starts quoting spongebob, i dive the archive and pull a screenshot of the scene
<Dermathil> Oh my, here comes the mech that's powered by orgasms.
<otakon> Dermathil: huh?
<Polydunami> Shizuka, I'm a similar way with M*A*S*H
<otakon> and then
<Dermathil> Aquarion works on orgasms.
<otakon> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOONAH!
<Dermathil> I wish I was joking.
<otakon> Dermathil: you're ..........not joking.
<otakon> -_-
<Polydunami> Right, is City of God too violent for bronystate?
<otakon> and yet no Mizuki Tachibane on it
<Polydunami> I mean, we saw Evil Dead on here
<Polydunami> And Requiem for a Dream...

<otakon> and hit
<otakon> and hit HARD
<MrPoniator> Still, it was a bit sad excuse for Harmony Gold to blend the shows like that, and then keep the rights so hard that Macross still hardly steps to America
<otakon> Tieria needs a heal
<Midnight_Tempest> oh damn... that was a good amount of damage
<Dermathil> not yet otakun
<Polydunami> I haven't even SEEN Robotech so I don't really have any kind of opinion on it
*BronyJenkins pokes panda
<otakon> Dermathil: dude, that was 40% of it's HP!
<Dermathil> He can take 40% more
*panda pokes BronyJenkins back :)
<Sumica> 00,10damn that things a tank
<Caramel> 2,14 he has a shield that mitigates damage
<BronyJenkins> :3
<Caramel> 2,14 so if he's attacked next turn, I'll just defend
<MahBoi777> need moar powah!
<otakon> Dermathil: and if they get a critical? he's screewed
<Caramel> 2,14 his shield will keep him alive
<GarrettBrony> need moar railings
<MrPoniator> I've watched some of Robotech, and I've watched Macross in its entirity (except Macross II) as well as Mospeda
<MrPoniator> haven't touched the third one they had in Robotech, though
<GarrettBrony> MrPoniator Anything new Animations wise
<panda> dat Caramel using "mitigates" :D
<otakon> dat little kid
<Caramel> 2,14 I really should have activated wall
<Dermathil> oh lol
<Caramel> 2,14 I should probably mention that if Trider dies, the universe explodes
<MrPoniator> Takin' a lil' break since I've been working the whole night on this promo I should've finished already dangit
<otakon> Caramel: yes you should have, say goodbye to Trider
<Ninjazz> D:
<MahBoi777> not the universe!
<Dermathil> so does the planet if Godmars dies
<otakon> goodbye univers
<dshannon> ooops
<GarrettBrony> and the would be terrible
<otakon> well, that was a hit but not too hard
<Ninjazz> Take your time, MrPoniator. The drought's only begun.
<Dermathil> Godmars dieing = nonstandard gameover
<Ninjazz> Well...
<MrPoniator> I'll attempt to get the season finale things out before June 15th, though
<Hodiku> MahBoi777! howdy
<MrPoniator> Since I'll be going to Sweden for a full week or so then
<otakon> MrPoniator: you are one of the creative minds that will get the community through the long ponyless summer. so, don't burn yourself out.
<MahBoi777> HEY Hodiku!
*MahBoi777 glomps Hodiku
<Ninjazz> Agreed with otakon.
<GarrettBrony> MrPoniator during droughts like these I consider your work to be a viable substitute for new pony episodes
<MrPoniator> heh
<dshannon> 0.o oh shnap
*Hodiku is glomped. Dropped loot includes muffins and tacos.
<otakon> Caramel: okay, how many of those are gonna show up in the nest stage? 20?
<MahBoi777> XD
<Dermathil> otakon: It is indeed better if he does his work, but we went through last year's drought without any single problem. The drawfriends and fanfics and songs were all there was.
<Caramel> 2,14 you got me
<otakon> MahBoi777: it happens.
<Caramel> 2,14 this is my first playthrough
*Phase4 is so tempted to hug Caramel
<Hodiku> <3 Drawfiends
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, I forgot to check your work out, MrPoniator :S
<MrPoniator> Is this "you die, character is dead permanately" thing?
<Caramel> 2,14 bitch dont touch me
<otakon> lol
<Polydunami> I've been meaning to check it out
<otakon> Caramel: you have a thing about hugs
<Caramel> 2,14 no, with the exception of godmars and trider, all mechs are repaired at the end of a mission if they die
<Caramel> 2,14 at the cost of money
<MrPoniator> kk

<Meanwhile> I can feel the buffering leaking out of the computer and into the world.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> i would link u a better one MahBoi777 but theres a stream
*Spectrum_Rush you are so small DeathStar
<Meanwhile> If this keeps up I'll become trapped in a bubble of buffered time, where a second for you is a decade for me.
<DeathStar> Spectrum_Rush: yeah
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Spectrum_Rush: she maybe small but shes fiesty
<MahBoi777> time bubblez
<Meanwhile> And then it'll wear off and I'll be in the year 5012.

<dshannon> ohohoho
<Phase4> i'll try somethign else
<Ninjazz> But, bare in mind my internet is CRAP.
<Ninjazz> So, if others can get it, I'm not too much of a priority.
<Wrek> 05bare in mind zits are evil
<Ninjazz> Aye.
<Ninjazz> Blemishes be one of the most terrible evil to walk the face of man.
<Phase4> i'm dropping the bitrate
<OneTrickPony> good morning
<Phase4> hopefully that will work
<Ninjazz> Hey OneTrickPony!

<OneTrickPony> hello Phase4, Wrek, and Ninjazz
<Wrek> 05hi OneTrickPony

*OneTrickPony hugs Ninjazz back
<DeathStar> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: you there?

<Ninjazz> Alright... It's a bit better now. Still getting a bit of lag here and there.

<Kandarihu> The sale ended a bit bofore Monday
<OneTrickPony> oh idk
<OneTrickPony> I just wish I got it at the time
<Phase4_> OneTrickPony: you could get an account
<Ninjazz> Heh. Didn't stop me from not getting it.
<Ninjazz> Hey Kandarihu, btw.
<Phase4_> plus its still cheap now either way
<Spell-of-Gaming> WAIT
<OneTrickPony> Phase4_: my computor is too slow right now I am waiting till I get a new one
<DeathStar> by any chance dose anyone know what colours duskstarshimmer wanted to be?
<Ninjazz> Eh. I already played it on PS3. Don't feel like getting it again. :S
<Phase4_> ah, its gone back up to $20
<Spell-of-Gaming> PORTAL 2 WAS ON SALE FOR $7?!
<Phase4_> OneTrickPony: i know the feel
<Spell-of-Gaming> DARNIT, I MISSED IT D:
<Ninjazz> Eyup.
<Phase4_> Spell-of-Gaming: yup
<Ninjazz> Last week.
<Kandarihu> So, is Wrek streaming this? Or who?
<Ninjazz> Lemme just scroll up, DeathStar.
<Phase4_> Kandarihu: i'm streaming
<Kandarihu> Ah
<Ninjazz> Ahh welcome to a Phase4 stream, Kandarihu.
<Meanwhile> Load weed everyday.
<Phase4_> i need to find something interesting
<Phase4_> and stream that
<Phase4_> portal 2 is all fine and good but still
<OneTrickPony> imma get this one: http://www.digitalstormonline.com/gaminglaptoploadx15.asp?id=568648
<Spell-of-Gaming> Phase4_: Japan.
<Phase4_> uh oh
<Phase4_> Meanwhile: server connection problems
<Kandarihu> I saw you streaming yesterday morning. You were playing Beyond Good & Evil, so I thought I"d download it myself.
<Phase4_> awww
<Phase4_> Kandarihu: you should, its an excelent game
<Phase4_> hmmm, different game?
<Kandarihu> But I'm having driver compatibility issues. Lots of graphic glitchyness. And I can't seem to get the game out of Fullscreen mode
<Meanwhile> :3
<Ninjazz> Sorry, DeathStar. Too much text to find any specific colors. :(
<Phase4> Kandarihu, that will happen
<Phase4> Meanwhile, lol, problems?
<Ninjazz> DeathStar: But I did hear Yellow and pink or that might have been Shane.
<Kandarihu> I need to find a way to put this game in a Windowed mode
<Phase4> Kandarihu, there isnt one
<Meanwhile> I had a brief loading delay
<Phase4> i looked
<Meanwhile> Then you disconnected.
<Phase4> Meanwhile, it told me there was connection problems
<DeathStar> Ninjazz: yeah that;s shane but it's ok thanks for trying
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<Meanwhile> Eh. Told you it might blow up at any moment.
<Ninjazz> DeathStar: Sowwy :(
*DeathStar hugs Ninjazz it's ok :)
<Phase4> tf2 time?
<Phase4> XAX, you there/
*Ninjazz hugs DeathStar back :3
<Meanwhile> On the bright side, think of how good you are at science.
<Phase4> ah, he's ingame
<Ninjazz> FOR SCIENCE!
<Phase4> Meanwhile, ^_^
<DeathStar> I'm going to dance off to bed now good night everypony
<Phase4> we did seem to make a good team there once i got the lag figured out
<Ninjazz> Gnigth DeathStar! Don't be a moon!
<Meanwhile> Night DeathStar
<Phase4> night DeathStar
<Ninjazz> Let's see if my computer still has enough strength to run TF2.
<Phase4> i'ma join xax in tf2
<DeathStar> if shane of duskstarshimmer comes on can you tell them the I losr dusks colours?
<DeathStar> or*
<Ghosties> 04I should probably stop what I'm doing
<Meanwhile> Needs to be about 20% more Sumerpan. http://i.imgur.com/jCrJx.jpg
<Ghosties> 04Lest I begin to feel sick again
<Ninjazz> Sure, DeathStar. :)
<Meanwhile> What're you doing Ghosties?
<Ninjazz> Time for a break, Ghosties. :$
*DeathStar dances out of chat "good night everypony"
<Phase4_> awww, servers full
<valoreins> i really want to make an OC pony with a superman suit, but with a frying pan as a cutie mark
<Ghosties> 04Looking at a bunch of videos of gameplay footage of incredibly obscure Mortal Kombat knock-offs from the early to mid 90's
<Phase4_> DODGEBL
<Phase4_> DODGEBALL;
<Meanwhile> lolwut.
<Phase4_> you'll like this
<LightTrooper105> im back o3o
<Phase4_> once it loads
<LightTrooper105> and whats going on?
*Meanwhile used to rock the house at dodgeball games.
<valoreins> welcome back LightTrooper105
*Ninjazz doesn't play sports but is pretty good at them
<Ghosties> 04Thea Realm Fighters, Bloodstorm, and Catfight are really bad looking but Tattoo Assasins is the absolute *worst*
<Meanwhile> Before that tragic accident with the waffle iron anyway.
<Ninjazz> Tattoo assasins?...
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: Dodgeball is a custom TF2 game mode.
<Ninjazz> Oh.
<Ghosties> 04I remember I sat through a fatality video for Tattoo Assassins alone that was about 15 minutes long
<Meanwhile> Involving homing missiles airblasts and rampant gibbing.
*Ninjazz feels like an idiot now.
<Phase4_> note that i suck at this game but its still fun
<dshannon> dat mouse
<Ghosties> 04I felt nauseous after I was done
<LightTrooper105> i hear sound and only see the mouse..
<dshannon> omfg dat mouse is sexy
<Meanwhile> Not just me seeing the black screen then
<Meanwhile> Wonder why that is.
<dshannon> ooooo myyyy goooosshhhh
<Ninjazz> I hear the smexy boice PIE RO.
*Ninjazz staring at boice
<dshannon> umm wut
<LightTrooper105> Phase4 something might be wrong seeing only blackness and sound.
<Kandarihu> Yeah. Mortal Kombat really kicked off the Western Fighting Game craze. All of them vying to be bloodier and gorier and more shockingly violent than Mortal Kombat. Whether the other ones succeeded was a moot point, because they weren't fun
<Phase4_> XD
<Phase4_> instadead
<Phase4_> allso i cant rotate
<Phase4_> blackness?
<Meanwhile> I'd totally try and get in on this dodgeball game if I didn't have a bus to catch in 20 minutes.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> DeathStar: y u no sleep?
<Ninjazz> Let's just agree that Mortal Kombat was the best of the bunch.
<LightTrooper105> yes Phase4 now i see a mouse.
<Meanwhile> Yeah Phase4 we're getting a mouse and a black screen.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> DuskStarshimmer|Zzz: is asleep DeathStar
<Kandarihu> Phase4: no video
<Phase4_> oh damnit
<dshannon> pure entertainment! keep it up bro!
<Giger4444> what is happening?
<Ghosties> 04The makers of the game boasted that Tattoo Assassins had, and I shit you not, 2,196 fatalities
<Ninjazz> Seems like we got some technical difficulties.
<valoreins> i see the mouse is making a ruckus
<Giger4444> hello everyone
<Ninjazz> Got a meme for that Meanwhile?
<Meanwhile> Admittedly, the sounds of flying rockets and airblasts and MMPHMM are quite funny.
<dshannon> is that you talking...... who's talking?
<Ninjazz> Hey Giger4444!
<Phase4> gah, stupid game
<Meanwhile> Ninjazz: A meme for what?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey guys ill bbl ok :D
<valoreins> ohai Gigen4444
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile: Technical Difficulties
<Meanwhile> Bye Alicorn_Prince_Shane.
<LightTrooper105> take care Alicorn_Prince_Shane.
<Ninjazz> Cya Alicorn_Prince_Shane! Stop being an alicorn.
<Ghosties> 04I mean, how are you gonna come up with 2,196 fatalities? And further, how would you implement all of them in a single system board
<Ninjazz> On the other hoof, are those music mods on server or your own, Phase4?
<Giger4444> Yesterday night we talked about staying up late, or for staying up for 48 hours and such. Now I am up for the 30th hour and its starting to show :D
<Phase4> on the server
<Phase4> hurry op tf2
<Ninjazz> Oh.

<Ninjazz> Get excited.
<Ninjazz> I know I am.
<LightTrooper105> lul
<Phase4> ok, so tf2 is broken
<LightTrooper105> its seem like it
<Meanwhile> Danananananananana derpderp
<LightTrooper105> either that of TF2 hates your stream
<Phase4> tf2 works excelently
<Phase4> just wont stream
<Meanwhile> Needs more Vs Saxton Hale.
<Phase4> uh....
<Phase4> Meanwhile, ikr
<Phase4> Meanwhile, theres this low gravity saxton server i realy like
<Phase4> but they havent updated :(
<Meanwhile> Low grav Saxton.
<Meanwhile> I can only imagine.
<Phase4> Meanwhile, axifortress low gravity saxton
<Phase4> it is EPIC
<Meanwhile> Vagineer is best Vs character.
<Giger4444> Vagineer sounds dirty...
<Phase4> Meanwhile, :<
<Phase4> Giger4444, it is
<Phase4> his face is a *censored*

<Ghosties> 04But uh
<Phase4> no idea what to stream
<valoreins> let's watch sumerpan
<Ghosties> 04I think we've hit the very bottom of the shame barrel now
<Giger4444> how about streaming a new series?
<dshannon> pony fantasy 6?
<Phase4> interesting
<Giger4444> House, ER, Walking Dead etc?
<dshannon> just a thought
<valoreins> or watch campy shows
<dshannon> brb
<Ghosties> 04There was a game that came out in 1996 where Jackie Chan starred in a fighter called "Fists of Fire" that also included fatalities -________-
<Phase4> top one looks good
<Phase4> lets watch that
<dshannon> having a shower I smelly XD
<LightTrooper105> o.o....
<Ghosties> 04Et tu, Jackie?
<valoreins> oh... my...

<Ninjazz> Hmmm. It appears my internet is lagging.
<Phase4> my brother is on tf2
<Ninjazz> Time to get rid of him. He he he he he...
<Phase4> and i have bugger all upload
<valoreins> am i the only one singing along here?
<Ninjazz> Atleast you are trying, Phase4. That still counts in my book. :)
<Giger4444> derp
<Malavolent> valoreins: I would sing too, if I wouldn't liste to something else.
<valoreins> :s
<Phase4> stupid slow mouse interface
*Phase4 is linux guru
<Malavolent> Dat Linux.
*Ninjazz is not familier with linux
<Phase4> i'm accepting requests in #Vinyl_Scratch
<Ninjazz> Oh, Phase4! Get ready for my list!
<Ninjazz> :D
<Malavolent> No way, first time I see that requests are allowed!
<valoreins> i'll take an oreo, and eat it!
<Giger4444> how about streaming just some music playlist for now?
<XAX> Your list?
<Phase4> INTERNET
<prince-dari> Well it was always my view that you guys didn't need it, so I never had it set to run here
<Phase4> y u so slow tonight
<prince-dari> But if you guys want it that much
<prince-dari> Sure. :P
<Phase4> repeat it is
<Malavolent> Princesses: Party hard.
<Phase4> 01,06 the colour script?
<Phase4> lol purple
<Phase4> i see no requests
<Phase4> #vinyl_scratch << there
<Malavolent> Muted :D
<Giger4444> I love it when the buffering takes more time than the song itself
<Phase4> oh, so it is
<Wrek> 05*yawn*
<Phase4> in here then
<Malavolent> Wrek can fix this! :D
<Ninjazz> Aye, XAX. I always keep videos I'd stream on a list.
<Ninjazz> WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T SEE ANY REQUESTS!? :[
<Phase4> Ninjazz, #vinyl_scratch is muted
<Malavolent> Ninjazz, you've been posting on muted channel. :D
<Phase4> lol quit
<Mutterguy|Sleep> hi all!
<Phase4> Ninjazz, #vinyl_scratch is muted
*Ninjazz facehoof...
<Phase4> brohoof if you recognise the music /)
<Ghosties> 04Oh my lord, the political incorrectness of Western fighters in the 90's is hilarious
<Ninjazz> I would if I could hear it.
<Phase4> Wrek, you feeling ok?
<Malavolent> Reminds me of dubstep dishwasher.
<Kandarihu> All I know about that song is Bass Cannon
<Wrek> 05yeh
<Ninjazz> Ahhh Dat Basscannon!
<WhimsicalG> Anything airing besides music?
<Ghosties> 04You can play as a prostitute in a game called "Time Slaughter" where her post match win quote is "My pimp hits harder than you!"
<Phase4> Wrek, bug me when you want to take over, i'm just gona stream music for a bit
<Ninjazz> (\
<Ninjazz> Forgot about that. :)
<Phase4> and now for something completly different
<Kandarihu> So more Portal 2 is out of the question?
<Mutterguy|Sleep> Phase4 is streaming OMG!!!
<Ninjazz> Hey Mutterguy!
<prince-dari> Ghosties, Skype?
*Phase4 hugs Mutterguy|Sleep
<Wrek> 05ill take over afer maintinance
<Mutterguy|Sleep> HI Ninjazz
<Mutterguy|Sleep> OOPS
<Giger4444> this program reminds me of fast tracker :D
<Giger4444> oh the memories
<Ninjazz> Dat Bass Cannon song... Where did you get it, Phase4? I must have it.
<Phase4> Ninjazz, google 'bass cannon extended', its not the actual song, just bits and pieces pasted together
<Ghosties> 04Fucking fuck, man
<Phase4> brb
<Ghosties> 04"Too bad I didn't lose...I like lying flat on my back."
<Ninjazz> Thanks, Phase.
*Mutterguy hugs Phase4 back
<Ninjazz> Wtf Ghosties o.o
<Wrek> 05gotta love it ghosties
<prince-dari> Ty?
<Ghosties> 04Again, another win quote from the prostitute character from the fighter "Time Slaughter"
<Ninjazz> Hey prince-dari!
<prince-dari> Hey.
<Ninjazz> Doing good?
<prince-dari> Yes thanks, you?
<Phase4> back
<Ninjazz> Been better, but good. Thank you. :)
<Ghosties> 04Oh, that makes sense. The game was made by a couple of sixteen year olds
<Ninjazz> That's what happens when you have hormones make a game.
<prince-dari> Nevermind then. BBL.
<Ninjazz> Cya prince-dari!
<Giger4444> dammit why do I always want to click on the recommendations in the stream window?
<Kandarihu> Wow. Dat irony
<Phase4> Giger4444, solved ^_^
<Ghosties> 04There's even a modern website for the game where you can download it in its entirety -_-
<Ninjazz> lol No thanks.
<Giger4444> :)
<Phase4> this song is called 'elements of harmonics' btw
<Ninjazz> Yes... Now I can make mods with Just Mah BASS CANNON!
<Ninjazz> THE POWER IN MAH HANDS!
<Phase4> y u default to 360p youtube
<Malavolent> Sexy Octavia.
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Phase4> ohai Saturn
<valoreins> ohai Octavia
*valoreins kneels
<Wrek> 05ok ready Phase4
<Wrek> 05just say when
<Phase4> Saturn, ffmpeg doesnt rate limit correctly :( i was having problems with it earlier
<Phase4> i like this song
<Kandarihu> So, you were having problems with Beyond Good & Evil glitching up too?
<Malavolent> I like this pony.
<Phase4> Kandarihu, yeah
<dshannon> ...element of harmonics, by chain algorithm?
<Phase4> dshannon, yup
<dshannon> boom
<Phase4> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqB1MbXSeGk << link
<Kandarihu> http://www.gog.com/en/forum/beyond_good_and_evil/graphical_difficulties
<dshannon> I got it in my media player playlists
<Malavolent> Guys, does anyoneknow a game called "Outlive"?
<Phase4> Kandarihu, are you on a multi core machine?
<Kandarihu> Yes
<Phase4> Wrek, ready
<Phase4> Kandarihu, thats half your problem, the games engine is not thread safe
<Kandarihu> This song. I can't grasp it's form
<dshannon> lol element of harminics without harmony?
<Phase4> dat wow
<dshannon> ....
<Kandarihu> I tried merely turning off the HW Vertex Processing. That stopped the glitching, but also caused a lot of lag.
<Malavolent> Phase: You nailed it.
<Kandarihu> So I went by the whole guide. I"m going to see how well it works.
<Phase4> Kandarihu, i've found that the more powerfull the gpu, the less problems you get
<Phase4> allso fouind zero problems when running within wine on linux
<Phase4> Malavolent, XD
<Phase4> wow and diablo look so similar to me
<RaveBrony> Good morning everypony! :)
<Ninjazz> Hey RaveBrony!
<valoreins> ohai RaveBrony
<Malavolent> The character screen does look similiar.
<Phase4> Kandarihu, thats why i'm guessing its a threading issue, opengl on wine is explicitly synchronised, on windows theres no such luck
<Malavolent> Even the objectives, messages... ok, it's from the same company.
<Ninjazz> Eh.
*Ninjazz never played WoW
<RaveBrony> Who is streaming? :o
*Ninjazz doesn't have plans to play Diablo 3 either
<Ninjazz> RaveBrony: Wrek.
*valoreins only played during the Wotlk expansion
<Malavolent> Diablo 3 is overrated.
<RaveBrony> Oh, i thot it was, just making sure :P
<Ninjazz> I agree.
<Ninjazz> I think I'll go rest my back for a bit.
<RaveBrony> You hurt your back Ninjazz?
<LucidDream> I'm enjoying Diablo 3
<Malavolent> Cya, Ninjazz.
<Nabronyan> Hello, everypony
<LucidDream> Hater's gonna hate
<Ninjazz> RaveBrony: Nope. My chair doesn't have a backside on it so it's basically a stool on wheels.
<RaveBrony> Ninjazz: Ouuuuch >.<
<Phase4> mostly unrelated note: if anyone here has a newer laptop with 'nvidia optimus
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: You should invest into a new one.
<Phase4> herp derp enter
<Ninjazz> Indeed. I should...
<RaveBrony> Ninjazz: Yeah, you should go rest your poor back then... :\
<Ninjazz> My back is begging for one!
<valoreins> can't judge about something until i tried it, except alcoholic drink and drugs lol
<Malavolent> Since you spend a lot of time on it, I guess.
<Phase4> with optimus, you will need to force all the .exe 's in the bge folder to use the dedicated card
<Ninjazz> Aye. I'll go do that, RaveBrony.
<LucidDream> Level 53 Demon Hunter :D
*Mutterguy saw optimus and immediately assumed transformers. alas.
<RaveBrony> ^ same :D
<Malavolent> So... according to Know your meme there are 800 000 bronies total.
<RaveBrony> So, from what ive been told, you cant enter fun little random make games in D3 like you could in D2? O.o
<LucidDream> Not sure what you mean RaveBrony, but you can join public games
<Mutterguy> Malavolent i think that factioid has a expiry date
<RaveBrony> LucidDream: did you play Diablo 2?
<LucidDream> Yes
<Malavolent> Mutterguy: I think there are more of us.
<Wrek> 05random make games?
<LucidDream> I guess you can't join 'random games', because you can pick what quest you want to do in a public game
<Mutterguy> yes indeed. you have to consider the time of writng
<LucidDream> and it finds people around your level on that quesat
<LucidDream> quest*
<RaveBrony> Wrek: Ah, i cant really explain it.... :\
<Malavolent> When I look at the succesful brony meetups, I wish there was one in my country.
<Nabronyan> Diablo is awesome
<BlazeAngel> Sumica Hey... *poke poke*
<valoreins> ohai Nabronyan
<Nabronyan> Hello
<BlazeAngel> Oh and Hi everypony.\
<Ninjazz> Hello BlazeAngel!
<OneTrickPony> k i back, I just finished making a 20 min mix
<valoreins> and hai BlazeAngel
<RaveBrony> Like, in Diablo 2, you would go to battlenet and just make a name and password and enter a game? You know, to have everything respawn?....or can you like, do that automatically?
<Giger4444> I'd rather go to a convention or a VA panel. But the closest one is about 10000 kilometers away :D
<OneTrickPony> hiya BlazeAngel
<BlazeAngel> Is tehre a mod here today?
<LucidDream> You can start on any quest you have already got to RaveBrony
<Ninjazz> Well, Wrek is streaming atm, BlazeAngel.
<Nabronyan> I heard from my brother that you can make real money off of Diablo 3
<Nabronyan> Is this true?
<BlazeAngel> Anybody else Ninjazz
<LucidDream> In theory.... The real money Auction house isn't up yet
<Ninjazz> Ghosties and prince-dari, I believe.
<Nabronyan> :L
<BlazeAngel> Nabronyan: You can make real money off of every game.
<valoreins> oh well back to drawing :D
<Nabronyan> Nope
<Nabronyan> Not Tetris
<BlazeAngel> Ill tell ya how.
<Giger4444> BlazeAngel: just not every method is legal :D
<BlazeAngel> No, its legal.
<BlazeAngel> Sell it. Trolololol.
<Nabronyan> LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
<Woodenfan> OH GOD IT'S 6:30 WHAT IS THIS
*Ninjazz didn't see that one coming
<RaveBrony> LucidDream: Start on any quest? O.o so i cant make a "Dropping random rare items" game? D:
<Giger4444> that's not making money, thats cutting losses :D
<BlazeAngel> prince-dari: Hey. *pokes you*
<Woodenfan> Eh, I'll come back later
<Nabronyan> In my case, it's giving back wasted time.
<prince-dari> Hello.
<BlazeAngel> prince-dari: I have a couple questions that will benifit mankind.
<prince-dari> Ok, go ahead.
<Nabronyan> I have a couple mankinds that will benefit question.

<Malavolent> Ninjazz: On the internet noone knows you're a pony.

*Ninjazz throws a tomato at Malavolent
<prince-dari> I didn't really decide I wanted to be a mod. I didn't submit a mod application or have an interview. I was made mod right back in the early days, and this happened just because I thought I had skills that could help out, and offered them. At the end of the day I was just offered a position in the team.
<Ninjazz> Gotcha, Phase4.
*Malavolent throws a pillow at Ninjazz.
<RaveBrony> Malavolent: Yeah, i smiled at it
*Ninjazz face covered in pillows.
<Ninjazz> OH
