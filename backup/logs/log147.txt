<Apokalipse> Hi Bjornfot
<pony_586990> well

<Octavia> 13It's a secret, if you're new. ;)
<Bjornfot> i just remembered that we had this thing :3
<Bjornfot> even though it's all dead
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<SploogeTheFish> lol

<Bjornfot> http://www.veemi.com/embed.php?v=qwertyasfasdfasdfaxc&vw=720&vh=500&domain=www.bronystate.net
<Starchaser7> a bit of lag but no matter
<Saturn`> aaand back
<mib_1ynxki> I like that Tony Guy
<CriticKitten> Huh, we're five minutes in and plots are getting blessed. Must be a good movie.
<Apokalipse> And you're not helping making it less dead by not even joining :c
<Kalisia> Thank ye kindly.
<Darf14> The artwork and animation looks good
<Octavia> 13I hate that term "Pegasister". Sounds stupid.
*CloudRunner doesnt care about a small chance that Octavia is not a girl. Octavia's plot wins all no matter the gender.
<TrickQuestion> am I behind?
<Shad> Holy plot
<Flutterz> ah there we go
<Silverscreen> Dat eye
<mib_1ynxki> Pegasister sounds too long
<TrickQuestion> huge eye
<Luna> 07,01dem eye
<GGgala> but main hasn't been too crazy lately it seems... i seem to remember it being impossible to follow on movie nights before o_0
<SploogeTheFish> Stop staring at me o.e
<Grundle> <3 bunny
<prince-dari> I'll change just one last setting, should fix lag.
<Shad> you missed the blessing of the plots trickquestion
<RAWRity> so...what have I missd about the movie?
<Apokalipse> This art style is creeping me out...
<Grundle> may that bunny live a long, healthy life
<Darf14> BUNNY! :)
<ThePretender> reminds me of the opening to Lost
<PinkamenaDianePie> BUNNEHS

<Apokalipse> It's never crazy on saturdays
*CloudRunner cant look at bunnys now. too distracted by Octavia's plot
<mib_1ynxki> Just do with brony. it's not like mankind and womankind are separated.
<MeteorVenture> how far into the movie are we?
<Sumica> Oh are we back on Octavia's plot again?

<InsertCupcake> he has great HARE
<CloudRunner> there for Octavia's Creed is best
<SploogeTheFish> Implying that the grass in his mouth is brighter than the one on the ground
<GGgala> that'd be the sensible approach
<RAWRity> starchaser0 isn't it?
<prince-dari> It IS a kid's film.
<Starchaser0> WHAT
<Shad> this film is unclassified
<Octavia> 13Somehow that rabbit actually grew hair on his head...
<Nyst> It's a kid's film with nightmare fuel.
<Dumori> Hell I'm a proud brony but I'm not gonna start flame wars ect
<GGgala> if going against the grain is really too harrowing

<Roxas> well... maybe that new Weird Al Polka video?
<Luna> 07,01however, I will stream S2 episode 1 & 2 tomorrow
<Scorchman1337> I've had all my weird al after last night xD

*Kalisia tolerates the shit out of this show (just pretend it's a troll)
*Luna just loves cats

<CloudRunner> it is not making me sad (thank god) because of all that cheeze!
<Lagmobile> No really is it? I cant remember...
<herospirit> Cheese is delicious
<Anhedonia> the first time I saw Twilight "turn" in that episode I got really really sad.

*MoonDasher is shufflin'
<Anhedonia> one of my fellow brony pals told me that there's some contest or something that OCs can become canon background ponies
<Anhedonia> is this true?
<herospirit> One man can break a friendship in ten seconds flat.
<CloudRunner> herospirit: just about killed me when he said that... I am so lucky the next thing I looked at was this. http://i.imgur.com/ADyAR.gif
<herospirit> I dunno, Anhedonia.
<MoonDasher> LMAO CloudRunner
<Anhedonia> hmm. It would be interesting to know. Just curious.
<MoonDasher> Thats so cute
<Lagmobile> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/ponychan-imager-crawler.html
<Natleyn> Anhedonia: They were taking in OC's for background ponies later on, but that was a while ago
<Ziltoid> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XVYH6UWDSeI/Toel-QkZxwI/AAAAAAAANGQ/_53afMlOZbU/s1600/CNYFZ.gif
<Anhedonia> I think it's really cool that this site streams movies a lot. I can't help but always ask this, but, what are you guys's favorite movies?
<Lagmobile> for that thread of wallpapers I gave you guys
<Ziltoid> That is best gi
<CloudRunner> herospirit: a true friendship is physicaly impossible too break. Ive had people try
<Anhedonia> Natelyn: oh, okay. Thanks.
<Natleyn> I am a supercreeper and I've turned it from Facebook to ponies and EqD :l
<herospirit> In that case CloudRunner
<herospirit> I have never had a true friendship, and never will.
<CloudRunner> my ass you never will
<herospirit> Deal with it. BI
*Natleyn huggles herospirit
<Natleyn> You're my little beta tester and you will be forever. :l
<Natleyn> Long after we stop testing~
<herospirit> Mm.
<Natleyn> ... Now I sound like GLaDOS.
<herospirit> In my experiences, no matter how strong a friendship, it can, and will, shatter.
*Natleyn shrugs
<herospirit> :I
<Anhedonia> I'm really sorry to hear that herospirit...
<herospirit> Actually no.
<herospirit> Shatter would be better.
<herospirit> It wil just dissappear.
*Veewave is never amused!!!
<herospirit> Sienty.
<Anhedonia> it sounds like you've had a lot of emotionally draining friendship experiences... I mean I wouldn't know, but, that's just the sound of things...
<herospirit> :I
<Anhedonia> is that true?
<CloudRunner> herospirit: do you need another dose of Dawww to straighten up your additude!? http://i.imgur.com/Aqhtf.jpg
<Lagmobile> Oh hey I JUST found a new wallpaper thread
<Lagmobile> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/462612.html#462612
<herospirit> LOL. Dat auto kick
<Natleyn> I've seen that a lot, hero, but every friend I've kept on the internet I've kept for years
<SploogeTheFish> Was gone longer than expected. Sorry guys.
<Natleyn> 's cool SploogeTheFish
*Lagmobile feels thae hate from Natleyn
<Natleyn> No worries
<SploogeTheFish> Hey can i make a song request?
<Ziltoid> I dear
<Natleyn> Lag...
<Flutterguy> Hey Splooge
<Flutterz> oh no
<CloudRunner> RD's voice is best her
<Flutterz> not this
<herospirit> Daribot does NOT APPRECIATE MY BULLSHIT
<Natleyn> I'm not sure whether you love me or want to see me suffer watching me download this.
<CloudRunner> no Luna is asleep now
<Flutterz> Splooge, Luna is asleep
<MoonDasher> At the gala
<SploogeTheFish> I wanted to make a request for the 8-bit "At The Gala"
<herospirit> But no, really. My friendships always last, mmm, a few years, I'd say.
<SploogeTheFish> But i guess its a lost cause now.
<herospirit> And then they just quietly vanish.
<SploogeTheFish> But this song seems really odd.
<SploogeTheFish> O.e
<Anhedonia> I've had a lot of bad friendship experiences herospirit. I'm not claiming to know how you feel or exactly what it's like for you, but I know that things like that are very painful.
<SploogeTheFish> Is GGgala for real here this time?
<Anhedonia> Just yesterday I got in a really bad argument with my sister. It sucked a lot.
<CloudRunner> how old are you herospirit ?
<SploogeTheFish> Oh lord.
<herospirit> Well, they're not painful, really, since they're so, I dunno, quiet.
<CloudRunner> and do you move a lot?
<SploogeTheFish> The person that sounds here...Is for real the Queer in the steer.
<herospirit> Not too old, and I haven't moved since I was little.
<MoonDasher> This is actually a little catchy.
<SploogeTheFish> Last time i moved was about 6 months ago.
<herospirit> Me and my friends just deift apart, I guess.
<Natleyn> hero, I'm going to love and tolerate you as long as I can contact you :l
<Anhedonia> still, I'm sorry to hear that.
<herospirit> drift*
<SploogeTheFish> I just really wish somebody was for real streaming, Not on a damned playlist.
<SploogeTheFish> One thing he forgot..
<Natleyn> I hope you know what you're in for, hero.
<SploogeTheFish> PINKIEQUEST
<herospirit> Yah, sorry. I'm dragging everypony down again. :I
<Anhedonia> I'd stream if I could. I have no way of doing it
<Anhedonia> you're not dragging me down herospirit
<Anhedonia> I don't mind talking about these things
<Flutterguy> hero, I know how you feel. Cause nobody really speaks to me anymore.
*Veewave heard the words "love and tolerate" and is now in the mood
<SploogeTheFish> This pony who is singing is really dragging me down
<MoonDasher> I don;t understand. Is he a pony, that like, freakin sings?"
*Natleyn hugs Veewave
<Lagmobile> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/465129.html
<Flutteryay> TOOT
<Anhedonia> oh I saw this video, it was funny!
*Veewave hugs Natleyn
<SploogeTheFish> Bronystate in a specific video? HOW CAN THIS BE?! :D!!!
<Ziltoid> This is so great
<Natleyn> Lag...
<Natleyn> FUCK IT
<Natleyn> I'M NOT DOWNLOADING ANYTHING UNTIL I GET SOME CELESTIA BANNED TORRENTS
<CloudRunner> hmm... untill recently herospirit, I havent stayed in the same place for more than a year. I can still remember my friend in 4th grade. every last detail. I can remember all of my friends in 6th grade. and so on. I havent seen/contacted them in years but they are still my friends. forever.
<MoonDasher> TheItalianStallion is Italian and this translation is COMPLETELY ACCURATE
<SploogeTheFish> I feel good for that old man.
<MoonDasher> I cant believe theyre bronies too! ^^
<SploogeTheFish> It looks like he just won his hears content.
<Veewave> Is Pinkiequest still on their playlist?
<SploogeTheFish> *hearts
<CloudRunner> 4th grade was when I made my first friend btw
<Anhedonia> I think there will be world peace once everyone alive becomes a brony
<Veewave> ^

<CloudRunner> herospirit: but I normally dont do these to people because I like being neurtral
<Lagmobile> And love for animals
*SploogeTheFish still thinks this playlist needs a little dab of PINKIEQUEST or SCOOTAQUEST.
<MoonDasher> PinkieQuest! Yes!
<herospirit> Answer me this bronystate. What is the essence of "distrust"?
<Fluttershy`> 08,01Wut you think I have pink hair in real life? lol not QUITE yet at least
<Lagmobile> Luna just left the stream on a playlist and went to bed
<Anhedonia> pink hair is awesome
<SploogeTheFish> Distrust? That element does not exist
*Veewave agrees
<Fluttershy`> 08,01she did? Luna really did that? o-o
<CloudRunner> someone has to start a conversation with me in order for me to talk to them.
<SploogeTheFish> Pinkie proved this.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01oh look
<Fluttershy`> 08,01wait hmmm
<SploogeTheFish> Orlynao? I dont think he fell asleep, Or i dont really know what the fuck he did
<CloudRunner> SploogeTheFish: I distrust everybody untill they can prove otherwise

<SploogeTheFish> Well...Let me tell you
<SploogeTheFish> "Distrust is the best way to lose a friend....FOREVER!!"
<Veewave> I tolerate and love you, CloudRunner.
<Anhedonia> I'm sorry if I ever provided a reason for you to distrust me CloudRunner
<herospirit> EXACTLY, SPLOOGE.
<CriticKitten> lol, Fluttershy`, you are adorable. xD
<herospirit> It's for the OHC.
<CloudRunner> by distrust I mean neither trust nor have reserves about
<herospirit> Orbital Hatred Cannon, for the uneducated.
<CloudRunner> 100 percent neutral
<Anhedonia> well okay but still. Hope I don't bother you
<SploogeTheFish> You dont tolerate and love me? :'(
<CloudRunner> SploogeTheFish: thats why it is very importiant that my friends are trust worthy
<Lagmobile> Right so who wants more pony stuff?
<Natleyn> ... never again.
<Lagmobile> Well im doing it anyway!

<Lagmobile> lol Chicago
<SploogeTheFish> But for now on, Ive been addicted to The ducktales music
<CloudRunner> ok Im good for the night. That fic wont get to me. Have moved it to the "steel box" section of my mind. It wont get out for at least 16 hours. (unless I re-read the fic itself)
<Anhedonia> oh man
<Natleyn> SploogeTheFish: THE MOON
<SploogeTheFish> Especially the moon soundtrack
<Natleyn> 'nuff said
<Lagmobile> what would the title of ponified Chicago be?
<SploogeTheFish> Yup
<Anhedonia> I had an ex girlfriend who was all over Chicago
<CloudRunner> Took a bit to do but it is done
<SploogeTheFish> Exactly what im listening to
<Anhedonia> you know what I wanted to do?
<Anhedonia> dub Bridesmaids over FIM
<Anhedonia> sounded like fun
<Anhedonia> too bad my video editing programs stink : /
<MoonDasher> INTO HIS HEAD
<CloudRunner> use to do that with my anger. ended up bad after a few months of it
<MoonDasher> ^lol
<SploogeTheFish> Ive always wanted a girlfriend who didnt care i was a brony...This seems like a lost cause :'(
<herospirit> My anger comes in violent bursts, usually.
<Natleyn> ^this
<Natleyn> So true.
<Anhedonia> I don't know how it affects my chances, but
<Anhedonia> I haven't dated ever since I became a brony
<Anhedonia> my ex left me before I became one, though
<Lagmobile> You mean this Anhedonia ? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgqx3o0JmhU
<Natleyn> herospirit: Have you ever played Oblivion?
<herospirit> >Mfw Spike is the guy who gets killed in every story
<Anhedonia> AW DAMN
<Anhedonia> someone beat me to it DX
<MoonDasher> arsenic. haha
<Lagmobile> I ve played oblivion
<Anhedonia> oh well
<herospirit> Yes, Natleyn. Why?
<Anhedonia> at least I don't have to do it now
<Natleyn> herospirit: Do you remember the Adoring Fan?
<CloudRunner> Calmest person you could ever meet. untill I snaped. when I snaped I snaped hard. last time I broke my wrist because I was litteraly trying to kill my brother. Couldnt control it either. stoped "bottleing" my anger after that.
<herospirit> ...Yes.
<SploogeTheFish> When i get angry, I hold it all in, But then when i finally get pissed off the notch, I just let of a really big ass angry scream, And i feel better.
<herospirit> I remember the adoring fan.
<Natleyn> herospirit: I am your adoring fan. Except, I'm slightly less annoying, a lot more huggy, and I'm faster and more invulnerable. :l
<CloudRunner> I dont like screaming.
<CloudRunner> so that didnt work for me
<Lagmobile> dont think i got far enough to meat the adoring fan
<herospirit> Silly Natleyn.
<Lagmobile> meet*
<herospirit> There are a LOT better people to adore.
<CloudRunner> herospirit: so humble *swoon*
<CloudRunner> lol no homo
<CloudRunner> :p
<CloudRunner> this vid is...
<CloudRunner> what?
<Natleyn> Oh hero, I'm not exactly adoring you
<herospirit> I don't hurt people when I get angry. Unless like, they deserve it.
*Tovler can't rap and can't sing but will do anything for loo-ooove.
<Natleyn> Tovler's got it right ;D
<CloudRunner> herospirit: exactly
<Lagmobile> brb
<Natleyn> herospirit: This is just normal friendship for me. xD
<herospirit> Your bro deserved it? :I
<Natleyn> I do this to everyone. :l
<CloudRunner> my bro threatened me with a knife. Sharp objects are something nobody should ever point at me
<SploogeTheFish> Finch-What is it to burn plays when it get it too much over the edge..
<herospirit> Well, in that case CloudRunner, I'm glad you beat his arse.
<CloudRunner> did not beat it
<Lagmobile> and back
<SploogeTheFish> What is it to burn is my angry song
<CloudRunner> held him off the ground vader style
<Anhedonia> sorry : /
<herospirit> Still works CloudRunner.
<CloudRunner> then my other brother lifted me into the air. freked out because of it and let me drop
<herospirit> he had it coming.
<herospirit> he had it coming.
<herospirit> He only had himself to blame.

<CloudRunner> he doesnt tell whole store
<MoonDasher> implaed upon a stick?
<CloudRunner> storie

<MoonDasher> KILL THEM.
<SploogeTheFish> And he says that we are faggots for watching it.
<herospirit> ...I wub my siblings. They are fucking awesome.
<CloudRunner> suddenly... what would happen if I bottle what that fic did to me over and over again?
<SploogeTheFish> I told him that he is missing out
<CloudRunner> hmm
<SploogeTheFish> He told me to fuck off
<SploogeTheFish> I just left him after that
<herospirit> Really. My brother introduced me to MLP FiM.
<SploogeTheFish> Mongreled bastard needs to try it out before critisising it..
<Anhedonia> oh wow
<CloudRunner> I think before I go to sleep every night I will just have a good cry so I dont get all emo or some shit
<ctrlx> guys i have a problem
<Anhedonia> I was introduced to FiM by a friend
<Natleyn> Cloud...

<Anhedonia> I don't know what to do
<MoonDasher> I love this video!
<CloudRunner> Anhedonia: what?
<SploogeTheFish> I feel left out all time, I reallly dont know why.
<Anhedonia> about everything
<Anhedonia> your emotional stress
*Tovler unmutes his gay-music playlist
<Anhedonia> sounds very painful
<SploogeTheFish> I was gone from the room for a long time now
<CloudRunner> no dude not your fault
<ctrlx> a while ago i had a pinkie pie plushie. i cuddle it every night. today i got a twighlight sparkle plushie and i don't want her to feel left out but i don't know how to snuggle two ponies without favoring one over the other...
<CriticKitten> Anhedonia: My bro's the same. I just point out to him that I'm perfectly comfortable with who I am and what I like, and that maybe he's not comfortable with who HE is if he's mocking my tastes.
<CloudRunner> its actualy very refreshing
<Lagmobile> Also the original song for this is "Frontier Psychiatrist"
<Anhedonia> huh?
<herospirit> Ctrlx.
<Tovler> haha, I just now read the rule change that happened from Toyland.
<CloudRunner> havent felt emotions like this EVER
<herospirit> You have
<ctrlx> how do i snuggle two ponies?
<Lagmobile> have it on my iPod
<SploogeTheFish> Snuggle with em both. I got 2 smurfs. Thats what i do.

<CloudRunner> dog died. didnt car
<Anhedonia> oh...
<CloudRunner> e
<Veewave> My brother is a homosexual and thinks ponies are childish, I kicked him out of my house (I tend to kick people out of my house when I'm angry.)
<herospirit> You have the BEST FUCKING PROBLEMS EVER, ctrlx
<CriticKitten> Whoops, *Splooge. Sorry for the accidental highlight, I'm just trying to catch up to the convo :p
<Lagmobile> more OxVS http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/src/131709526344.jpg
<Tovler> Babes in Toyland isn't legendary. Nobody could have seen that coming.
<CloudRunner> one of my closest friends died. still didnt care
<SploogeTheFish> Its ok :P
<Natleyn> Lagmobile <3
<CloudRunner> I got a little woried about it actualy
<CriticKitten> But yeah, I basically turn it on my bro when he does that.
<herospirit> Maybe if I had a Twilight or Pinkie plushie, I wouldn't hate the world with such a fiery passion.
<Tovler> Frontier...
<SploogeTheFish> Still guys
<ctrlx> i guess i'll just kinda like...stack them...
<Natleyn> herospirit: This is now one of my goals. :l
<SploogeTheFish> What should i do? My brother wont shut the hell up about it.
<herospirit> What is, Natleyn?
<CloudRunner> herospirit: get this man a plushie!
<ctrlx> well let's see how it goes. gnite everypony~
<Natleyn> 2) Get herospirit a pony plushie

*Natleyn huggles ctrlx goodnight
<Natleyn> Sleep well!
<Anhedonia> I wouldn't hate the world with a fiery passion if I died and passed away into Equestria. >___>
<CloudRunner> love that pic
<Lagmobile> Night ctrlx
<SploogeTheFish> 3) Get me an Apple jack plush Oh gawd. I would be happy.
<herospirit> I don't think I could hate anymore if I had an MlP FiM plushie with me. :I
<Lagmobile> John Joseco is freaking awesome
<Tovler> crookedtrees is a genius
<Natleyn> I love Joseco and Crooked to death
<Natleyn> TO DEATH
*herospirit is halfway expecting Natleyn to learn hacking just to find my hometown/address and send me a Twilight plushie
<Lagmobile> MagaSweet is... well, MegaSweet
<CloudRunner> anyways I have never felt love/sadness over any living thing. this emotion feels good. still cant apply to actual things but still. its nice
<Natleyn> herospirit, it's not very far from what I know already :3
<SploogeTheFish> *looks at pinkie pie plush images*
<SploogeTheFish> inb4 g3.5 ponies invade
<SploogeTheFish> (aka 80's ponies)
<Tovler> suddenly Applejack is best pony.
<herospirit> Welllll, I guess you know my state, Nat.
<Lagmobile> Whole Octavia image thread... just octavia stuff: http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/447808.html#447808
<Anhedonia> Applejack is so great >_<
<CloudRunner> LAG IS A GOD!
<herospirit> And my age and gender
<herospirit> But that's a lot of potential herospirits. :P
<Tovler> Applejack: The pony everyone forgets when someone tries to recall the main 6.
<SploogeTheFish> I dont know why i laugh when somebody does an inb4 joke
<Anhedonia> >_> I always remember Applejack.
<herospirit> I don't forget any of them, but I lose count and think I do. :0
<CloudRunner> Inb4 SploogeTheFish laughs again
<herospirit> Somehow.
<Tovler> ah ah ah ah ah ah ah AH
<Lagmobile> Actually I just have a thread with a link to everything... I may be Agnostic but I still dont want to be smitten so here it is http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/465129.html
<Natleyn> Lagmobile: Why.
<Natleyn> WHy.
<Natleyn> I'm...
<CloudRunner> agnostic = win
<Natleyn> It's so hard not to just go download everything ever. :l
<CloudRunner> love it
<MoonDasher> I absolutely love this video
<Lagmobile> Did you need help downloading stuff? http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/ponychan-imager-crawler.html
<CloudRunner> Natleyn: second
<Tovler> agnostic = neutral neutral
<Natleyn> Lagmobile: I don't have the space, though. :[
<herospirit> Agnostic is kinda like...
<herospirit> like...
<Lagmobile> Agnostic means dont belive there's a god but the possibility of a higher power
<herospirit> "What religion are you?" "Like I fucking know."
<SploogeTheFish> ponies IRL is my favorite meme of ponies
<SploogeTheFish> God its so gullible
<Natleyn> Agnostic won't believe anything without proof, but they don't doubt anything from lack of proof....
<Anhedonia> I'm technically agnostic I guess
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I love singing this song...
<Natleyn> Fluttershy`: Same
<Dashite> I'm just apathetic
<CloudRunner> I feel that there may or may not be a highter power, bu tim not going to waist my time wondering and Im just going to live my life.
<herospirit> "The absence of proof is not the proof of absence"
<Lagmobile> If he does exist I like to believe he has a stach of thunderbolts in a giant bucket just for people like us
<CloudRunner> thats what agnostic means to me
<herospirit> Anyways, I'm still Christian.
<Natleyn> herospirit: I think you mean "The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence"
<herospirit> :I
<CloudRunner> what herospirit said!
<MoonDasher> AWAKEN!
*herospirit slaps Natleyn around a but with a trout
<herospirit> bit*
<herospirit> XD
<Natleyn> .... sorry. ;---;
<Tovler> I just assumed Agnostic don't think about God. As in they don't care enough to think about.
*Starflower hugs Natleyn
*Veewave slaps herospirit around a bit with a large trout
<Veewave> No
*Natleyn hugs Starflower
<herospirit> :I
<herospirit> ...Sorry Nat 20.
<Lagmobile> can we not turn this into a religion thing? Thats wat episodes of "Feeling Pinkie Keen" are for
<herospirit> NNNG
<CloudRunner> I say Im agnostic because there is no better way to describe it in one word. but the best way to describe it is "I just truely dont care"
<Tovler> Feeling Pinkie Keen was my first live episode.
*Natleyn hugs herospirit
<herospirit> I still CANT BELIEVE people turned that episode into a religious debate
*Veewave slaps Veewave around a bit with a large trout
<Anhedonia> sorry >_>
<CloudRunner> Lauren couldnt either
<Tovler> The lesson made perfect sense in the pony universe.
<Lagmobile> Ya I thought that was going to happen but I never really expected it
<herospirit> It kinda pisses me off, you know?
<CloudRunner> lol I wouldnt know actualy
<herospirit> :0
<Lagmobile> wait who said they loved the ponies IRL meme? http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pic/res/466089.html#466089
<Tovler> I hope lesson zero does away with the letters.
<CloudRunner> I really wouldnt. I was born a counter troll
<Natleyn> Lagmobile: Splooge did
<Lagmobile> well tht was a link for him then
<Veewave> All I have to say on the matter is: Haterz gonna hat but we'll still love and tollerate the shit out of them.
<herospirit> It doesn't upset you that they turned every discussion of that episode into a religious debate?
<Lagmobile> Kinda
<CloudRunner> ponies IRL is cool
<Tovler> It's a one-sided debate so far
<CloudRunner> herospirit: nope. bacause I didnt participate in those debates
<herospirit> I know, I dont either
<CloudRunner> It didnt effect me therefore why let it make me mad?
<Veewave> *hate
<herospirit> but I cant mention the episode without a debate popping up.
<SploogeTheFish> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wHwJoxw4i4&feature=related once again hooked to another 8 bit song by randomly navigating
<Tovler> welp, back to my gay-music list
<Natleyn> .... dat beat
<CloudRunner> herospirit: ignore it and it will actually go away
<Lagmobile> There needs t be more fan art of Film Reel
<Fluttershy`> 08,01please don't post too many links kthxbai >>
<Lagmobile> only 2 artists have even noticed film reel
<Fluttershy`> 08,01;p
<Lagmobile> aww
<CloudRunner> lol ok Fluttershy`
<Veewave> religions have been known to pass...
<Fluttershy`> 08,01srsly... I know it's not very crowded and all... but... yeah don't spam too much lol
*herospirit is still Christian
<CloudRunner> :)
<Tovler> Zoroasterism is making a comeback thanks to that new Pokemon Zoroark.
*Veewave opens a can of Spam "Oh sorry"
<Lagmobile> Christianity is never going away though, one of the mega cities in the world is based soleyon christianity
<Tovler> (that was random even for me)
<CloudRunner> herospirit: born christian. saw so many diff religions and views. decided they were all the same thing. realized fighting over it was stupid. quit religion.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01TO THE LUNAR REPUBLIC
<CloudRunner> at age 8
*SploogeTheFish asks if anybody is streaming on there computer currently
<Fluttershy`> 08,01<(^w^)>
<CloudRunner> parents didnt know untill I was 16.
<Fluttershy`> 08,01(>^w^)>
<SploogeTheFish> Didnt know what cloud?
<Fluttershy`> 08,01<(^w^<)
<Fluttershy`> 08,01^(^w^)^
<CloudRunner> that I didnt believe in a god
<Anhedonia> I'm fine with anyone believing in whatever they want to believe in. You know, as long as they don't like, try to force people into converting and stuff.
<CloudRunner> grounded for a month after that
<Fluttershy`> 08,01v(^w^)v
*Veewave is not here to instigate
<Fluttershy`> 08,01Please stop theology debates D:

<SploogeTheFish> Hey why is there ei in some episodes?

<SploogeTheFish> Look at the screen
<Fluttershy`> 08,01This is why I say Dari sounds like David Bowie!!!
<Tovler> E/I says "No Luna for you, Faust"
<Anhedonia> I hadn't analyzed that in FIM but... hmm...
<SploogeTheFish> Look in the top left orner
<Anhedonia> oh

<Anhedonia> OH

<Fluttershy`> 08,01xP
<Lagmobile> You gotta stop apologizing Anhedonia
<Natleyn> But I don't wanna. :l
<SploogeTheFish> I know what we should watch

<Fluttershy`> 08,01My....

<CloudRunner> well that isnt good. you should go to sleep
<MoonDasher> Wheezing? Do you have asthma like I do?
<Lagmobile> Who do?
<Lagmobile> You do

<Lagmobile> What babe?
<CloudRunner> feels bad for Fluttershy`
<MoonDasher> Fluttershy` I have asthma too. Do you have an inhaler?
<herospirit> Counting my meds was depressing last night.

<CloudRunner> herospirit: whyso?
*Natleyn huggles herospirit
<Fluttershy`> 08,01No I mean... I haven't needed one yet anyway, even though I've been given one before
<CloudRunner> SploogeTheFish: reply
<Tovler> I don't think I've ever wheezed before. Sounds scary.
<herospirit> 15 pills a day, with an inhalent twice a day.
<CloudRunner> what you need SploogeTheFish ? the anthology thing?
<MoonDasher> Oh. Well maybe bedrest can do some good. I usually wake up and im not wheezing anymore. MOST of the time that is, Fluttershy`
<SploogeTheFish> It would be cool if we could play it, But i still think luna is still streaming
<CloudRunner> Luna is streaming but is asleep
<Fluttershy`> 08,01hopefully it wont turn into anything worse >_<
<Shutterfly> how can you do that?
<Fluttershy`> 08,01I get bronchitis easy D:
