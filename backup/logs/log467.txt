<Ghosties> 04What's wrong with being called Napalm? :P
<Ghosties> 04That's a pretty badass nickname
<valoreins> lemme guess, is it because you blew up things during chemistry class?
<Chrysalis> yes, a viscous acidic combustable liquid designed to kill
<Life_Essence> if that was the case half of our school would have that nickname
<Chrysalis> which dissolved skin while burning people alive
<Chrysalis> great nickname
<Life_Essence> natural gas outlets
<CrazyCherry> Hiya BronyState!!!
<Life_Essence> and matches
<Chrysalis> hiya CrazyCherry
<valoreins> ohai CrazyCherry
<Life_Essence> heya CrazyCherry
<Ghosties> 04But it's such an ACTION NAME
<Ghosties> 04NAPALM
<valoreins> like a badass codename
<Life_Essence> it's better than cheezles
<CrazyCherry> GilDash is probaply so angry at me right now....
<Chrysalis> why
<CrazyCherry> Ah wasn't here yesterday...
<Ghosties> 04Because he obviously ate all of GilDash's raspberries
<Ghosties> 04I would be angry too
<Life_Essence> I think you have an unhealthy obsession Ghost :P
*Chrysalis gives Ghosties some raspberries
<Chrysalis> and some lemons
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> any idea Where xmasskills went?
*Ghosties noms raspberries
<CrazyCherry> Ghosties: How do you know what he's angry at me?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: do u still h8 it when people lick u?
<Ghosties> 04It's not an unhealthy obsession, Life_Essence, it's just my food of the day
<Chrysalis> Alicorn_Prince_Shane just lick Saturn if he does
<valoreins> i dont mind if its in chat
<Ghosties> 04I don't know, Crazy
<Ghosties> 04And yes, no licking me
<CrazyCherry> Imma playing minecraft.
<valoreins> but NO IRL
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: apparently Twi_Fi is scared of u
<Chrysalis> CrazyCherry pc or xbox
<CrazyCherry> Pc
<Chrysalis> awesome
<Life_Essence> or handheld
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> oh and Ghosties can i ask u a question?
<Ghosties> 04NO
<Ghosties> 04.......................................................................................................yes
<Life_Essence> too late you've already been asked
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol
<Ghosties> 04What is your question
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> umm Ghosties itss related to my head phones umm when i bend the cables a little bit the sound cuts in and out? wut do i do
<Ghosties> 04Well first
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ghosties: should i just send it back to the company
<Life_Essence> "Can I ask you a question" "You didn't really give me a chance to object"
<XAX> dat tech question
<Ghosties> 04You put them in a trash compactor
<Ghosties> 04Then
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol
<Ghosties> 04You take out what's left (whatever's salvageable), then you reconstruct the core of a nuclear reactor
<Ghosties> 04Then
<Ghosties> 04You apply duct tape
<Ghosties> 04And you're good :D
<dshannon> then profit!
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> note to self dont ask Ghosties a tech question
<CrazyCherry> Now where's my wood....
<Chrysalis> So ghosties, what do you do when there is a netsplit
<CrazyCherry> Mere coal.
<Ghosties> 04In all honesty I just keep bending and twisting the wire until I get sound in both phones back, but typically, in my experience, it's a sign that they're dying
<Ghosties> 04Well
<Ghosties> 04When there's a netsplit
<Ghosties> 04First
<Life_Essence> ^ then tape then in the postition they work XD
<Ghosties> 04You get an IRCop
<Ghosties> 04Then
<CrazyCherry> Where the hell is my axe?
<Ghosties> 04You tell them that if they do not have catfish that they should really invest in the tuna market
<Ghosties> 04Then
<Ghosties> 04You go to said market (catfish or tuna, either doesn't matter as both will work) and confront the manager
<Ghosties> 04From there you ask him for the secret password
<Chrysalis> this is the best tech advice ever
<XAX> ^
<Ghosties> 04And if he doesn't give you the password then he's a filthy commie, and you should just tar and feather him
<Ghosties> 04And that's how you fix a netsplit
<XAX> my sides
<XAX> oh god
<Life_Essence> it's like if tech advice was an Adventure Game
<Ghosties> 04Glad I could help
<Chrysalis> not really
<CrazyCherry> Dem red text walls....
<Chrysalis> for a netsplit
<Chrysalis> thats reasonable advice
<Chrysalis> just wait it out
<XAX> Ghosties: You didn't just help. You made my night.

<Ghosties> 04And I'll charge $230 a pop to glance at it from a 5 foot distance

*N4X eats rapsberries
<Shane377|Angry> Ghosties: so u have no idea about channel bans ?
<Ghosties> 04I do, but what I'm saying is that if someone banned you normally then they're permanent depending on the type of ban they placed

<Sylandest> Invi: frying a banana is delicious?
<Invi> oh god yes
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm

<Sylandest> Invi: I have never attempted it, lol
<Twi_Fi> I love how the scout falls to his death but stops in mid-air, like it's too much trouble to fall al the way.
<Meanwhile> The others for the scout milestones being the Bonk and the Sandman,
<Invi> Sylandest look up the recipe and try it. it's worth it ^^

<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Have I shown you what I've drawn?
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Welcome to the SLAG servers :P

<Ninjazz> No you have not, Malavolent.
<Ninjazz> Always the case, Invi. :)

<Malavolent> It's not really a big thing, but I'm happy I'm making small progress: fav.me/d50wrkq
<Ninjazz> Indeed. :D
<panda> Malavolent: you just earned yourself a watcher :D
<Ninjazz> Oh I remember that one.
<Lil_B> Malavolent is it ok if i ad you as a friend on DA?
<Ninjazz> Yeah... Good lines.
<Malavolent> panda: Well thank you, sir :D
<Malavolent> Lil_B: But of course, go on.
<panda> Malavolent: octavia is my fav background pony... and who ever draws her.... is mah best friend D:
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Really? I guess it's truth if more people say so. I still need a lot of practice though.
<Malavolent> panda: She is one of my favourites too. :)
*Lil_B is only person without favourite background pony
<brony_swan> so who all is on this server
<panda> Lil_B: why? :D
*pyrocatboy is enjoying the sounds of combat.
<Ninjazz> Still good, Malavolent. Looks good.
<Malavolent> brony_swan: I've watched the MLD trailer.
<Malavolent> The animation of Dashie is surprisingly good.
<brony_swan> did you like it
<Lil_B> panda I don't know, I just don't see something special about them :/ not even Derpy
<Bacon[Hazard]> pyrocatboy: its so.... eroooootic
<brony_swan> hang on im in game
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Thanks, guess who's next to draw? :D
<Ninjazz> Well, you don't need a favorite, Lil_B.
<pyrocatboy> Bacon[Hazard] Better than any kind of music.
<Bacon[Hazard]> damn right
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: You should draw... Lyra is always a popular choice.
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: I don't have any strong feelings for Lyra, but I might draw her someday.
<pyrocatboy> Bacon[Hazard] ... we're sick fucks, aren't we?
<Bacon[Hazard]> Why can't I hold all these Bonbons?
<Malavolent> The next one is Trixie, though.

<dishwasher_EXTREME> what?
<Phase4> 00,02i airblasted before it hit
<brony_swan> so close to living
<Bacon[Hazard]> :D
<Ninjazz> Perhaps you should consult Imdb, Reikim.
<Reikim> I'm trying to fill out my survey form, but I'm not sure in which category to place it...
<Reikim> For that matter, not sure whether it would actually be permitted here.
<dishwasher_EXTREME> ehh Ninjazz no specific mood today?
<Ninjazz> Tired.
<Ninjazz> Want me to put the tag up? :$
<dishwasher_EXTREME> oh;)
<FillyFlam> Reikim: You would be surprised.
<Reikim> Ninjazz: Okay, it doesn't explicitly say A/B, so how should I go about this?
<|Discord|> No one has taken the Battle net tag name "Discord" yet. I just did
<Ninjazz> Okay... Let me check this out for myself. Battle Royale was it?
<Reikim> Ninjazz: Yup.

<Petrified_Discord> Glad to have you back WallDives :)
<Bacon[Hazard]> yeah
<valoreins> zeus be mad
<Kandarihu> How long were you out of power, WallDives?
<FillyFlam> We're not allowed to pick documentaries for our movie choices, right?
<Petrified_Discord> Wow. Watching someone watch someone play a a video game. Truely we are through the looking glass :D
<Ninjazz> I'm sure you can pick one FillyFlam.
<WallDives> Kandarihu: it was out when I woke up, so...more than 4 hours.
<Ninjazz> It's all up to the mods whether or not they'll show it.
<CrazyCherry> http://blip.tv/joshscorcher/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-a-canterlot-wedding-review-6166403
<FillyFlam> Ninjazz: Oh, sweet.
<Light_Latias> 12good luck with that :3
<drfsupercenter> 03it's on Friday, but thanks
*Petrified_Discord breaks the chat silence
<WallDives> quiet.
<Kandarihu> Wow. A few weeks ago, I had a power outage that lasted for one hour. It was freaky seeing my laptop running on battery power while nothing else ran... not even my fridge or router.
<Petrified_Discord> Laptop > fridge
<Phase4> 00,02dinners cooking
*Petrified_Discord wonders what's for dinner...
<|Discord|> Petrified_Discord: Hai
<Petrified_Discord> ohai |Discord|
<brony_swan> now what
<Kandarihu> Well, it's not a matter of that. Everything without an internal battery was dead... except for the phone.
<Meanwhile> Prophunt!
<Meanwhile> Yay
<Phase4> 00,02now, prophunt i know
<brony_swan> ugh...
<brony_swan> lets do it
<WallDives> do what?
<Petrified_Discord> Combine?
<Meanwhile> Inb4 a bunch of people spam fire and die.
<Ninjazz> Da magics.
<Meanwhile> Aww and it's this level. Boss.
<WallDives> wait. if this is what it looks like...
<Kandarihu> Why are we talking about MY power outage? That was weeks ago. WallDives just came back from an even longer one.
*WallDives shrugs
<Kandarihu> Anyway, welcome back to the internet, WallDives.
<WallDives> yay for being in the middle of nowhere. cant wait until I move to somewhere with a backup generator.
<Skydroid> I've had
<Ninjazz> Can you compare that to having your router screw up and not have internet for 2 days?
<Skydroid> In total, one call for an interview
<Ninjazz> Turns out 2 days is a lot longer than you might think...
<Skydroid> That was summer 2010 :I
*Ninjazz twitches
<Kandarihu> WallDives: you can buy your own generator, you know. Even if you live in an apartment complex, you can run it from a balcony.
<drfsupercenter> 03well, >co-op jobs
<WallDives> Kandarihu: its a money issue, I'm a unemployed student.
<drfsupercenter> 03also o.o

<WallDives> Bacon[Hazard]: also, assassinated by your own invention, but rich all the same.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Mah Boi!!! SPAGHETTI FOR DINNER!!!
*Petrified_Discord could eat an octorok
<Bacon[Hazard]> WallDives: i shall use magnets >:D
<WallDives> doesnt change my point.
<WallDives> It'll be like Red Faction 2.
<Dken2021> allo you crazy people
<WallDives> you'll be walking along, then BAM! Blue beams.
<Ninjazz> Hey Dken2021! I'm not that crazy. :D
<Bacon[Hazard]> i mean i will use magnets for my Rail Gun
<WallDives> hello Dken2021.
<WallDives> Thats kinda how a railgun works...
<Bacon[Hazard]> handheld?
<Dken2021> custom map is zelda? neat
<Ninjazz> Uh Oh... Isn't Phase AFK? :S
<Airpuff> Zelda.. map? o.o
<Ninjazz> Nope.

<Dken2021> allo Airpuff
<Airpuff> Hai Ninjazz :¨P
<Bacon[Hazard]> :D
<Airpuff> and Dken2021 :P
<Bacon[Hazard]> what is this?
<WallDives> Bacon[Hazard]: handheld, you'd probably be better off with a coilgun.
<brony_swan> found a dead ringer
<Nerom> Hide and seek Is the best servers in tf2
<Dken2021> a custom TF2 map
<Petrified_Discord> Oh, so THIS is how prophunt works :D
<Ninjazz> I like the concept of a railgun.
<Phase4> 00,02i was planks
<Ninjazz> And we spai Meanwhile.
<Cobellanez> Johnny! You dropped your face!
<Meanwhile> >_>
<Ninjazz> Hey Cobellanez!
<Petrified_Discord> Cobellanez: I'll get you a new one!
<Airpuff> lol are people disguised as random items? xD
<Cobellanez> Hey Ninjazz!
<Dken2021> anyone tried the ultimate chimera hunt mod?
<Ninjazz> :)
<Cobellanez> Yes Dken2021
<Ninjazz> Yes, Airpuff. The point is to hide from the people with guns.
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: xD
<Ninjazz> Kinda like hide and go seak. :S
<Ninjazz> Only with guns. :S
<Petrified_Discord> Hide and shoot
<WallDives> bot seaking sucks.
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: and the ones who are found dies xD
<Petrified_Discord> Seaking fuck yeah
<Cobellanez> It is like Hide and go seek. Only YOU DIE!
<WallDives> haha, I saw what I did there.
<Bacon[Hazard]> my design will contain four electromagnets on each side of the gun, connected to a main battery (which can be replaced with another fully charged battery) and when shot down the center of the device, the metal bead will go atleast two times the speed of sound
<Bacon[Hazard]> ATLEAST
<Ninjazz> Horribly, Airpuff. :D
<Hawkie> :(
<Hawkie> ok
<Dken2021> playing as a sack?
<Hawkie> no student housing for me!!!
<Bacon[Hazard]> i need to work out some design flaws though :)

<twilight_sprinkler> mmmmh?
<Phase4> 00,02wrek is normaly up by now
<twilight_sprinkler> hmmmm
<HyperMetalLugia> Funny thing about GRUB and Mint is that you can hibernate Windows and Mint and be able to resume from either
<Viri> 14xD
<Dken2021> da majicks
<HyperMetalLugia> very carefully
<Petrified_Discord> Dat speedreading
<Bacon[Hazard]> FUCK DE MAJICKZ
<Viri> 14how are you two? :3
<twilight_sprinkler> Petrified_Discord: and backwards reading
<Meanwhile> Bomberman. Never played this game.
<Petrified_Discord> da saiense
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm okayish
<drfsupercenter> 03HML why is that funny o.o
<drfsupercenter> 03all hibernation does is make an image file
<Meanwhile> I played the old Bomberman on PC though, so I think I can probably adapt.
<drfsupercenter> 03that it boots from
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Saturn> 08,01are any of you familiar with the fundamental dogma of electronics?
<HyperMetalLugia> Because Windows 7 likes to hog the resume
<Petrified_Discord> Zap shit?
<HyperMetalLugia> and when I dualbooted XP and 7
<Bacon[Hazard]> No.
<Meanwhile> Don't spill water on it?
<Dken2021> only bomberman I played was on the gameboy
<Ninjazz> I don't think so... :S
<Saturn> 08,01there are 2 principles of the dogma
<HyperMetalLugia> I could only hibernate and resume from 1 OS
<Airpuff> Saturn: which is?
*twilight_sprinkler gets a pen and some paper
<Saturn> 08,01the first is that all electronics contain magic smoke, which is what makes them work
<Bacon[Hazard]> Don't submerge it in liquid even partially?
<Airpuff> xD
<Ninjazz> OF COURSE!
<Dken2021> magic smoke, got it
<Saturn> 08,01the second is that if the magic smoke escapes, the electronics will no longer work
<Airpuff> ._.
<Ninjazz> Everytime... :|
<Bacon[Hazard]> lol
<Saturn> 08,01i managed to make the magic smoke escape on the RCD in my shed
<Airpuff> Dem magic electronics..
<Meanwhile> This is epic.
<Saturn> 08,01so it no longer works
<Ninjazz> But now your shed is magical.
<Om> Ninjazz: Boo
<Saturn> 08,01i just recently bought an electric lawnmower, and was mowing the very long grass
<Ninjazz> Oh shut up, Om.
<Saturn> 08,01suddenly, it stopped working, so i went to check out the RCD in the shed
<Ninjazz> Wait... Hey Om!
<Saturn> 08,01(for those who don't know what an RCD is, think of it as a fuse box. if there's too much current, it will shut everything off)
<Saturn> 08,01so, on this RCD unit, there is a button marked test
<Om> Ninjazz: You're a slow one aint cha?
<Bacon[Hazard]> Saturn: FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU...?
<Ninjazz> Om: Tired as hell, more like.
<Saturn> 08,01the 'test' button *should* overcurrent the RCD and switch everything off
<Saturn> 08,01y'know, to test
<Om> Ninjazz: Ahh, cant blame you for that
<Dken2021> wha?
<Ninjazz> Om: No you can't. You can never blame me for anything.
<Saturn> 08,01instead, the test button was, at this moment, not the test button, but the 'release magic smoke' button
<Bacon[Hazard]> lol
<Airpuff> ... Saturn ... wha?... xD
<Saturn> 08,01this situation has a pro and a con
<Saturn> 08,01pro: i don't need to mow the grass anymore
<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn is high on magic smole
<Om> Ninjazz: Not fairly anyway
<twilight_sprinkler> *smoke, damn.
<Bacon[Hazard]> Pro: It works. Con: You get electrocuted.

<Saturn> 08,01today is proving to be interesting
<Petrified_Discord> Technology: noun. Anything that does something cool, but you don't know how it works. If it breaks, you have to buy a new one.

<Pinkies4thWall> RAWRity: how to reg to do so?
<Ninjazz> You shouldn't light a match when you smell magical smoke.
<Airpuff> I think its normally capped at 20 mins or something :s
<Dken2021> huh, so today is Daniel Tosh's birthday, neat, we share the same birthday

<twilight_sprinkler> Saturn: should i take c++ programming or matlab, the former is a better for me schedule-wise
<Meanwhile> Oh and this fits the sound very nicely. http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-party-with-class.gif

<Invi> Meanwhile that fits almost every song
<Bacon[Hazard]> suddenly..... links!
<Onyxia> Meanwhile: LOL
<PartyCannon> tl;dr good standing, mobile verification, no copyright issues
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: http://images.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw2933-1329602553300.gif
<Phase4> 00,02what the heck is going on
<Meanwhile> Phase4: Smash bros.
<WallDives> partying reasonably sucks. either be a good DD, or get plastered/be the last person standing.
<Dken2021> you tell me
<Meanwhile> Look out for pyros.
<Ninjazz> So much Rarity...
<|Discord|> Phase they are posting hilarious links
<Ninjazz> Me likey.
<Kandarihu> Smash Fortress?
<Meanwhile> Dat bat.
<RAWRity> So...how bout that new season of Red Vs Blue?
<Dken2021> sentry launched
<Meanwhile> So...what's Red Vs Blue.
<Meanwhile> :I
<WallDives> I dont like halo, and I know what RvB is...
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: the longest running American Sci-fi series.
<twilight_sprinkler> from what ive seen red vs blue has the same jokes over and over
<PartyCannon> The next Smash Bros. needs Kingof The Hill mode, just sayin
*Meanwhile shrugpony.
<Kandarihu> A popular series of Halo Machinima.
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkler: then you're seen wrong.
<PartyCannon> *King of
<WallDives> PartyCannon: the next smash bros needs actual fighting game mechanics.
<Petrified_Discord> WallDives: We already have that. It's called any other fighting game :)
<Dken2021> PartyCannon that be a good idea I tell ya hwat
<twilight_sprinkler> RAWRity: riiiiite
<Ninjazz> I kinda just stopped watching RvB after the third season I think.
<Bacon[Hazard]> :D
<PartyCannon> what Petrified_Discord said
<Meanwhile> Und then Phase4 brought the Slag Shop up.
<WallDives> Petrified_Discord: yes, but I hate the ensuing bitchfest that comes with the SSBB arguement.
<RAWRity> the next Smash Bros needs a 16 character roster, and a bunch of DLC character options.
<Meanwhile> How many games will it take to figure out I wonder.
<Meanwhile> Batter derp.
<RAWRity> also, it should have On-disc DLC
<Petrified_Discord> No items Final Destination? Fuck that. ALL ITEMS ON SUMMIT.
<PartyCannon> RAWRity and they need to be on the disc
<|Discord|> We should play Demoknights only.
<|Discord|> *THey
<WallDives> All Items on, 200m, READYGO!
<Kandarihu> Nintendo hasn't gotten into the whole DLC game, have they?
<Dken2021> nope
<WallDives> Kandarihu: not really.
<Kandarihu> Good.
<PartyCannon> They've dabbled in it
<Dken2021> they're still puzzled by online gaming
<Meanwhile> Nintendo hasn't gotten in to much that they haven't already done a billion times already.
<PartyCannon> With Nintendo Wi-Fi Plus or whatever it was called
<Meanwhile> That's how Nintendo works.
<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzschooloffail.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/homework-class-test-looks-like-i-need-a-number-pen.png
<WallDives> OR, you could say Nintendo did DLC first with pokemon.
<Ninjazz> Nintendo makes more couch multiplayer games.
<Dken2021> wii doesn't have a hdd so they can't really do dlc
<WallDives> and the first Casino in Ohio is supposed to open today.
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL SAT/ATC/TerraNova test
<HyperMetalLugia> I remember those
<drfsupercenter> 03TerraNova?
<Kimori> yo
<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzdatingfails.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dating-fails-saving-you-from-two-hours-of-vampiric-romance.jpg
<Onyxia> i have a nintendo DS since... oh god i dont remember
<Kandarihu> So most of the people on this map are playing Scout, I see? Inspired by the Smash Bros theme to go with the character who double jumps?
<WallDives> Onyxia: have had mine since 2004.
<RAWRity> So, less than a month til B/W 2 releases in japan!
<Kandarihu> Dken2021: good point.
<BlueFlare> 02LOL
<WallDives> RAWRity: YES.
<Bacon[Hazard]> gtg bye!

<RAWRity> Ninjazz: Pokemon Black/White 2
<Onyxia> WallDives: i see :p
<WallDives> Ninjazz: Pokemon Black/White 2.
<Ninjazz> Oh.

<Dken2021> Pokemon Black and White 2: electric boogaloo
<drfsupercenter> 03http://chzdatingfails.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/dating-fails-to-answer-your-question-yes.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Meanwhile> Und then Phase4 went to the mooooooooon
<Ninjazz> That was a good one.
<Pinkies4thWall> PartyCannon: where do i go to verify my account
<Pinkies4thWall> ?
<WallDives> not really, remember, GSC was a direct sequal.
<WallDives> and the original title being Pokemon 2.
<Cypresswolf> RAWRity: I'd give you my Kanji study ds study guide, but it's also untranstlated :P
<Airpuff> Ima log for a while, talk to you guys later.
<Airpuff> Bye
<WallDives> bye Airpuff.
<RAWRity> WallDives: of a sort. Though you didn't find out about that until afterwards.
<Dken2021> seeya Airpuff
<Pinkies4thWall> this video took a whole day to save on my computer
<Ninjazz> Cya Airpuff! Stay puffy!
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, ikr
<BlueFlare> 02lmao
<Meanwhile> Seeya Airpuff
<PartyCannon> Pinkies4thWall I can't link it directly cause my account is verified already. See the help article I posted
<panda> bye Airpuff :D
<WallDives> RAWRity: naturally.
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: Always :P
<Ninjazz> :)
<Skydroid> >viagra commercial in class
<Ninjazz> Ow.
<Cypresswolf> RAWRity: the least you can do is draw the symbols :P but unless you can read kanji, it has no other purpose
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: I'm almost afraid to ask, but how's your literary stuff doing?
<WallDives> although, B/W actually had a storyline this gen., so I'm actually interested to see what B/W2 adds.
<RAWRity> B/W 2 is in the same region, 2 years later, with several characters showing up from the last one.
<drfsupercenter> 03http://artoftrolling.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/internet-troll-thats-so-sweet.png

<RAWRity> Ninjazz: I just love the reference.
<Meanwhile> Allo mitamaking.
<WallDives> ...I dont know how I feel about that, seriously. Like I thought I'd be repulsed and outraged, but I'm all "meh" about it.
<Ninjazz> I see no reference, RAWRity. And I'm not calling you one of them.
<mitamaking> Does anyone play Team Fortress 1 anymore?
<pyrocatboy> Malavolent : I don't think it is. -gags-
<Malavolent> Well, this is why everyone hates us. :S

<Sylandest> I don't often play the competitive games, because once I get into a niche and master a character, folk get mad and ragequit...:$
<Om> Nothing works for me.
<WallDives> too bad I get destroyed when I go to a actual tournament, although its more for getting matched up against sponsored players.
*Ninjazz pats Om on the back

<Glacymr> this ipod app is amazing
<pyrocatboy> Anypony here watch the Amvs i linked?
<WallDives> thats unfair, although for me.
<drf-Droid> that's kind of an oxymoron
<WallDives> also, thats old and I was REALLY n00by.
<Glacymr> it's not a joke
<Glacymr> it's an app of this like 40 dollar game
<Dken2021> which one were you?
<Kosoveon> is it a dungeon crawler?
<Om> I have to get on my other computer to watch it, so i'll let you know when I see it
<Glacymr> 40 dollar board/card game
<Glacymr> no
<Kosoveon> oh
<Glacymr> Ascension
<WallDives> np.
<HyperMetalLugia> hii glacy
<Glacymr> it's this game made by magic players
<Kosoveon> I was gonna say, because ubisoft pulled that one
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Kosoveon> with a vita launch game
<WallDives> also, thats where I got the nick from :(

<Dken2021> so you were vega?
<WallDives> I'll scroll up and look at them later.
<WallDives> Dken2021: yeah.
<panda> WallDives: cherilee is a whore :(
<pyrocatboy> WallDives : ok
<BlueFlare> 02Vita looks pretty good if you ask me :P
<panda> Wait... no stream?
<BlueFlare> 02although EW back touch screen
<drf-Droid> yes but you also think the 3DS is good
*drf-Droid runs
<Dken2021> eenope
<panda> then.... watch this?
<panda> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZBysLAVUc
<Om> panda: You would know >.>
<WallDives> Honda/Claw is a 6-4 disadvantage for Claw.
<BlueFlare> 02I think the 3DS is good for something Nintendo would make XD
<panda> Om: oh hi... i didnt see you there
<Ninjazz> panda: Funny thing, I've seen that like 10 times but still laugh.
<panda> Ninjazz: gosh... about 20 times here.... XD
<Dken2021> it could definately use just a little more glitter
*Om sneaks increaced to 23
*Skydroid wants to see DRF and HML argue over the 3DS
<panda> Ninjazz: needs MAOR LITTER!
<Ninjazz> GLITTER.
<Skydroid> since usually you two like/dislike the same products
<panda> Ninjazz: ninja'd again :D
<BlueFlare> 02does HML like or dislike the 3DS?
<BlueFlare> 02I can't tell
<Kosoveon> IMO, 3DS>>>Vita, but both are good in their own ways
<drf-Droid> he likes it
<Ninjazz> Not really.... What the hell is LITTER? :D
<Skydroid> Yeah
<BlueFlare> 02ah
<drf-Droid> well
<panda> Ninjazz: I thought it said litter :s
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: another form of glitter? XD
<Om> He isn't a ninja, he just distracs ponies with his diamond plot
<drf-Droid> the fact I've paid for two 3DSes
<WallDives> panda: but I dont have cats, and I dont want to be arrested, so why would I need moar litter?
<drf-Droid> I obviously don't hate it
<drf-Droid> its just a major disappointment
<Skydroid> drf should give me one
<panda> WallDives: arrested? O__o for catts?
<WallDives> for LITTERING.
<drf-Droid> next time I gift one... LOL
<Skydroid> For cheaper price than GameStop is asking for refurbished
<panda> Ninjazz: PUNCH!!!!!!!!!
<pyrocatboy> panda What a CATastrophy.
<panda> wall.. you are stupid XD
<Dken2021> coooooomming
<Sylandest> oh howdy, panda!
<drf-Droid> EW GAMESTOP
<panda> Sylandest: :D herro ^^
<BlueFlare> 02don't worry, drf just gives stuff away for free
<drf-Droid> Amazon or GTFO
<Skydroid> GameStop makes it $10 off original price
<Skydroid> :I
<Skydroid> I've tried second hand stores
<Sylandest> panda: how are you today?
<Skydroid> They never have any used 3DS
<Ninjazz> PAWNCH
<drf-Droid> use Amazon or eBay
<panda> Sylandest: good :D and yourself?
<Skydroid> Maybe
<panda> Ninjazz: do you think miss cherilee and miss cherilee should get married?
<drf-Droid> And BlueFlare, -_-
<Kosoveon> the 3DS so far has good software, good apps/downloadable games, and it has a great community behind it
<drf-Droid> I don't just give things away
<Skydroid> I still need that PS2 of yours too :P
<BlueFlare> 02pro tip: Say you hate Apple stuff when you says he got a new 3DS. Then you'll have one
<Ninjazz> panda: *throws up*
*BlueFlare runs
<BlueFlare> 02he*
<Kosoveon> there are only a couple things about it I'm disappointed with and they are relatively minor
<Sylandest> panda: im doing good, if a little bored with no stream. its a good day off from work though! :D
<panda> Sylandest: haha well... do what I do when there is no stream :D
<BlueFlare> 02same Kosovo
<drf-Droid> the only good games so far are remakes
<drf-Droid> cameras suck
<drf-Droid> resolution sucks
<Kosoveon> >Resident Evil Revelations
<panda> Ninjazz: um... you know... the scootaloo parts make me a tad uncomfortable :s
<drf-Droid> etc
<Sylandest> panda: what do you do?
<alexxm> hey panda hows your day been
<drf-Droid> to each their own, I hate games like that
<BlueFlare> 02Super Mario 3D land was good
<Ninjazz> panda: I find those HILLARIOUS. :D
<Ninjazz> Ohhhh! Coooommmme!

<ChimeraReiax> Levels were too short
<BlueFlare> 02true drf XD

<Kosoveon> KH 3D should be good when it comes out but I'm not a fan of the voice acting (aside from the TWEWY characters)

<twilight_sprinkler> this guy makes the best tutorials http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH4NrUxcsYs
<BlueFlare> 02well, 2D can be 3D if you know what I'm saying XD

<drf-Droid> did you hear? if you look out a window, everything is in 3D!
<panda> WallDives: :( but... i like her accent...
<Kosoveon> yeah, but I mean it controls on a 2D plane
<BlueFlare> 02Really?!
<Dken2021> twilight_sprinkler excellent
<BlueFlare> 02D:
<Kosoveon> true but I doubt you'll ever see missilies and giant balls of fire thrown at you in 3D

<alexxm> going to get diner back soon
<drf-Droid> but the way the 3DS does it

<Skydroid> Why does BlueFlare bring up irrelevant things when drf never said 3D is fakr
<Skydroid> e
<Om> Naw, the mod stole our mod
<Skydroid> o.o
<Kosoveon> if Brave New World is correct, movies will be truly 3D because you'll be directly involved in them o.o

<twilight_sprinkler> Shizuka: either the one with real estate or when spongebob almost got fired
<Ninjazz> Sylandest: Yes... Now that I finally have you... I'd like to buy all your chocolate.
<Viri> 14without any fairness, since I still had one more test to do

<drfsupercenter> 03apparently you have to modify some firmware

*SayWhat dusts Mish.
<junh1024-XD> ohhm
<Rain> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03but, apparently I can modify 4.11

<iMusik> Guys, don't worry. They'll respawn.

<TheRainbowDash> What, not the puppy!!
<CCCP> :(
<TheDamShadow01> Hi Michael
<drfsupercenter> 03since, those unlock codes are one time use only, every time you restart the system it re-locks
<Irish_Pony> xD
<iMusik> A guy and a girl alone in a dark cave...
<drfsupercenter> 03and it'll prevent you from updating to non-promo firmware
<TheRainbowDash> Adorable things are her weakness? Really?!:D
<Irish_Pony> TIME FOR RAPE!
<drfsupercenter> 03so I updated to 3.55 official by modifying it with that
<Mish> 2 left >:) and the episode only began
<TheDamShadow01> what anime is this???
<SayWhat> iMusik: Tom Sawyer all over again
<Stormman3100> Ponies are her weakness
<drfsupercenter> 03but you can modify 4.11 with that as well, and there's a box "allow unsigned packages"
<drfsupercenter> 03so LOL
<TheRainbowDash> TheDamShadow01: "Angel's Beats"
<Sylandest1> Irish_Pony: down boy

<Airpuff> Shizuka: .. i guess..
<Cypresswolf> Redwall & Mossflower location found - now for some terraforming
<Mish> :O
<SayWhat> I'm just reading what's on the right side of my screen while Japanese language comes out of my speakers. L00l
<drfsupercenter> 03so just use a package manager, install it to a USB drive
<drfsupercenter> 03and you'll have decrypted files
<Airpuff> Shizuka: but hers.. are just sad....
<drfsupercenter> 03I already tried it
<Shizuka> 13ja
<TheRainbowDash> Shizuka: Sad backstory+ god animation= good anime.
<TheRainbowDash> *good
<TheDamShadow01> i like Mirai Nikki
<CCCP> sad? :(
<Airpuff> TheDamShadow01: agree.. its awesome xD Quite... gore though
<Sylandest1> such an odd anime...then again, I did step out for a fair portion
<Midnight_Tempest> pff... sad backstories are over-rated... everyone has one of those, its kinda boring...
<Airpuff> Sylandest1: You lost 1 episode. xD
<Airpuff> Omg.. this soundtrack..
<TheDamShadow01> Airpuff: yep
<junh1024-XD> is there a way without installing linux to copy-decrypt PS3games TO ISO?
<Airpuff> Beautiful music in this anime if you noticei t.
<Sylandest1> Airpuff: that one episode could've meant everything!!
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont notice cause im not watching it...
<Irish_Pony> all dat blood
<Airpuff> Sylandest1: Pretty much your understanding of the whole bottom plot xD
<Petrified_Discord> "Now Jerry, what can you tell us about the value of this vase here?" "Well, it's really heavy, so that's a good indication that it has a high market value."
<TheDamShadow01> D:
<Irish_Pony> xD
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: Oh my, that plot...o_o:D
<Rain> someone needs to revise all of the scripts so that prince-lemon is exempt from the kick
<Sylandest1> Airpuff: why did you say plot....agh my brain!
<drfsupercenter> 03um
<drfsupercenter> 03use ImgBurn to creat an ISO? :P

<Mish> XI
<Airpuff> TheRainbowDash: .. I'll give ya some of it.. all the people there have died irl, and ended up there, to... say rebel against god for their unfair life.
<junh1024-XD> i thought you said it's encypted?
<drfsupercenter> 03and what would you do with teh ISO anyway? All of the package managers, you have to extract them first
<drfsupercenter> 03it is
<drfsupercenter> 03but it's a regular disc
<drfsupercenter> 03the PS3 decrypts on its own
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff: ...I wasn't talking about that plot.
<CCCP> lol
<Airpuff> TheRainbowDash: ah Okei xD

<RyunosukeKnT> he was apparently warned, and disregarded said warning
<derpy_pony> being banned is no fun
<JetTheLatios> The shade of red for the 3ds sucks
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Kriel_Pony: nope not my fault
*CK|Ded happens to know a few folks who would most certainly not find that "joke" very funny.

<Skylands> 4 Chimera is paired with MysticLugia
<flutter_spin> oh. Did I join a banishment party?
<Chimera> ohai mystic
<RyunosukeKnT> then there is nothing to contest imo
<Obsidian> Then it was claUDE'S FAULT
<derpy_pony> boring party
<Obsidian> oops sorry caps lock
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Obsidian: basically
<derpy_pony> what did you need help with, flutter_spin?
<pyrocatboy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsK4RAAgTRM&feature=BFa&list=PLE3A0309D71C33362
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> um Shizuka
<CCCP> what would happen if everyone except Tom was permabanned?
<VenHur96> Banned is an cruel thing, it's takes everything away from you, because let face it, the person that's got banned has no social life whatsoever.
<JetTheLatios> Yes
<JetTheLatios> o:
<BlueFlare> 02I like black and purple 3DS the most
<flutter_spin> I'm still looking at this comic and I don't get it at all. People say its brilliant and ... well, I don't get it
<Shizuka> 13I have no sympathy for someone who makes such callous jokes.
<JetTheLatios> I like blue
<JetTheLatios> :3
<Rain> ^
<derpy_pony> banned even from bronystate
<RyunosukeKnT> VenHur96: I have actually had worse
<Chimera> Sky
<Chimera> that DS was mine
<Chimera> x3
<Shizuka> 13Use the ignore feature of your IRC client.
<BlueFlare> 02which blue?
<BlueFlare> 02dark blue or aqua blue
<BlueFlare> 02?
<Skylands> 10Female German voices are manly
<derpy_pony> which comic?
<Airpuff> VenHur96: No need to go on a personal assault.
<JetTheLatios> Aqua o:
<Chimera> they are
<StupidSexyCJ> flutter_spin: I think Rainbow Dash lost her ability to speak, so Pinkie did her fourth wall breaking thing to use the author's drawing software to resolve the issue
<BlueFlare> 02ah
<RyunosukeKnT> he's lucky he didnt get k-lined
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Shizuka: how does one appeal a ban?
<Obsidian> flutter_spin: Take a closer look at the final pannel
<derp_derp> RyunosukeKnT & everyone else: i vote we talk about something else = u=
<Skylands> 10And male German voices sound like they're mad
<Airpuff> VenHur96: he got banned, he did something bad, do not try to push him further down.
<Shizuka> 13Alicorn_Prince_Shane: http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<flutter_spin> That's the joke? .. kind of lame if you ask me
<Petrified_Discord> Dem rules
<Scooterview> 00,03Let's just hope you don't do anything ban-worthy and leave it at that, okay?

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Scooterview: how iz u?
<Skylands> 10Ickk
<derp_derp> NEW TOPIC: did you guys hear about the zombies man in miami?
<CCCP> derpy_pony: it should be a communist chat
<Airpuff> What are you guys "voting" for?
<RainbowAsh> flutter_spin, it's a bit clever. But you know how it is with jokes, if they don't work at once they fall flat when you have to explain them
<RyunosukeKnT> Luna
<Petrified_Discord> Vinyl Scratch is a pretty cool pony. She plays music and doesn't afraid of anything.
<Phase4> morning
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> derp_derp: oh yea the homeless man thing
<BlueFlare> 02leik
<derp_derp> that was crazy
<derpy_pony> vinyl scratch is seventh best pony
<flutter_spin> I guess its like making a Spongebob reference to someone who has never seen Spongebob.
<RainbowAsh> derp_derp, what did Arnold do now?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Shizuka: Claude is asking me if its perm ban
<Skylands> 10Listening to Kyoko's German VA makes it worse
<alexxm> i did derp_derp isn't he the guy who toke some bad LSD and went crazy
<CCCP> there needs to be a communist chat
<Kriel_Pony> derp_derp: No, i did not.
<Shizuka> 13Yes.
<CCCP> aww
<Airpuff> Shizuka: A perm ban? You banned him for such ealrier?
*Magical_pab|Shower walks in, naked. notices it , blushes and teleports away. then back with a towel wrapped around him
<RyunosukeKnT> he should have asked Shizuka or another mod
<Airpuff> Just asking..
<CCCP> Magical_pab|Shower: lulz
<Obsidian> Is everypony okay with her "cannon" eyes. I am but Im just getting everyone's opinion
<GilDash> Magical_pab|Shower: I saw you. ;)
<BlueFlare> 02hmm
<derp_derp> Alexxm they put 7 rounds in him, he was still standing
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> lol Magical_pab|Shower
<Petrified_Discord> Obsidian: Magenta is best eye color :)
<Magical_pab|Shower> GilDash: :P
<Kriel_Pony> Obsidian: I don't see why not.
<CCCP> Obsidian: you mean Vynil?
<Shizuka> 13Rape jokes aren't funny. End of story.
<Om> GilDash: STALKER!
<RyunosukeKnT> Obsidian: red isnt a bad color :)
<Obsidian> Yes
<alexxm> hey Magical_pab|Shower what have you been up to
<CCCP> Obsidian: i like them
<BlueFlare> 02that's the voice Skylands wishes she had
<Scooterview> 00,03I'm glad I missed that.
<Magical_pab|Shower> CCCP: 23 minutes... close enough
<pony_6500> Obsidian: I actually think they're better than red
<Kriel_Pony> Obsidian: I had no real preference before she had cannon eyes
<VenHur96> I love Vinyl Stratch, when she makes the debut on the show, she was no one special, aside from her fans, then came the big change, in "The Canterlot Wedding", the show took the bronies by storms when they revealed Vinyl's eye colour, and no, they're not red.
<GilDash> Om: He walked into my LOS. That's not my fault. :D
<CCCP> Magical_pab|Shower: ha!
<Magical_pab|Shower> alexxm: nick talks on his own :D
<Airpuff> Shizuka: Very well.. i think its a bit out of line, but very well, if its your decision
<derp_derp> rounds -> bullet
<Shizuka> 13If Claude so desperately wants to come back and make more rape jokes, they can go through the appeal process.
<BlueFlare> 02amirit?
<Skylands> 10Nope
*BlueFlare flees
<Om> GilDash: Oh. Oke den
<Petrified_Discord> Besides, in most cases a pony's magic relates to their eye color
<CCCP> poor claude i bet he didn't mean anything by it
<RyunosukeKnT> sounds like someone didnt read the rules
<TheDamShadow01> i gona play battlefield 3 see ya!!
<VenHur96> Sorry for my long message, but that's what I think of Vinyl...one of the best characters...
<alexxm> what Magical_pabs|Shower
<RyunosukeKnT> vinyl isnt bad tbh
<BlueFlare> 02what kind of voices do you like? XD
<CCCP> bye TheDamShadow01
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> [07:23:15] <Claudey> I understand that and I regret that and I would not do that again but that was too extreme
<derp_derp> im going to nap
<BlueFlare> 02on girls
<Obsidian> VenHur96: Feel free to speak your mind
<Kriel_Pony> Shizuka: I for on support you completely. Not that you need my support but it is the spirit of the thing
<JetTheLatios> She likes
*Skylands shrugs
<CCCP> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: not gonna work! :P
<Magical_pab|Shower> alexxm: i have been up to....shower??? (capitain obvious mode activated)
<RyunosukeKnT> hey Alicorn_Prince_Shane can you take that to pvt mssg?
<JetTheLatios> Stereotype high pitched anime voices
<JetTheLatios> .w.
<WindWhistler> VenHur96: are you new here?
<Skylands> 10Nothing sqeuaky high, nothing incredibly deep/low
*CCCP nomz off all his limbs
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ryunosuke: it is
<BlueFlare> 02so just normal?
<Skylands> 10Suuure

<RyunosukeKnT> ;)
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> im copying something she said
<Skylands> 10My voice is inbetween, but I still hate it
<CCCP> she?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ryunosuke: logic please
<BlueFlare> 02hurr
<alexxm> so who here has heard of a band called alestorm
<Magical_pab|Shower> GilDash: btw i hoped u saw me *sexy face*
<CCCP> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: she?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Ryunosuke: how can i talk with claude in mane chat if shes banned
<BlueFlare> 02mine is inbetween-low
<VenHur96> WindWhistler: Not really, been here for almost a month.
<flutter_spin> Oh. You have to read the book? No wonder. I couldn't even see the book. Well, at least I wasn't losing my mind now.
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> CCCP: yep
<RainbowAsh> Alicorn_Prince_Shane, does he realize there is no use in telling you all these thing? He can write all that stuff in an official ban appeal
<CCCP> ah
<GilDash> Magical_pab|Shower: I said I did. :D
<DrPug> no season 3 till september
<DrPug> qq
<RyunosukeKnT> ie. I dont think it is wise to post something that Shizuka said was over and done with in public clhat :)
<RyunosukeKnT> *chat
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> RainbowAsh: he is she
<CCCP> mfw some one gets banned in chat, chat talks about it for next 2 hours
<Magical_pab|Shower> GilDash: and i was hoping u did :D
<Shizuka> 13That makes it even more disgraceful
<Petrified_Discord> I move to close debate on the subject!
<DrPug> how would you get banned from chat?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> CCCP: yep
<RainbowAsh> Alicorn_Prince_Shane, duely noted, that doesn't invalidate my point, though
<StupidSexyCJ> this had been going on for two hours?
<flutter_spin> I won't be here for 2 hours. Just was super annoyed in not getting the joke. That comic tried way too hard to be funny.
<Magical_pab|Shower> GilDash: when i walked in, i mean:D
<DrPug> saying fluttershy sucks?
<BlueFlare> 02Well, it depends. I have a easy time adjusting my pitch XD
<thespitfirecolt> hay shizuka best pony in the world
<CCCP> StupidSexyCJ: it wil be
<CCCP> :/
<RyunosukeKnT> hence the pvt msg, (i meant a pvt convo with shizu)
<GilDash> Magical_pab|Shower: I've got eyes, haven't I? :D
<Om> GilDash: Not always
<RainbowAsh> DrPug, no, that would just get some goons sent to your home address
<VenHur96> While we wait for the 3rd season, we'll wait for MLP Online, let's face it, the bronies are crazy on the game, We're all going to play it because urimas, the creator of the game, deserves a pat to the back.
<mario_pony> ....
<Obsidian> So how does everypony feel about the movies this week?
<RyunosukeKnT> every time I see the word goons
<Om> GilDash: Your big head consumes them sometimes
<CCCP> hai mario_pony *nomz*

<GilDash> Om: Go play with some chocolate sauce Om.
<Petrified_Discord> VenHur96: Why wait for season 3? Let's make our own episodes! :D
<flutter_spin> That's ok. I already wrote 2 fanfics. That kept me busy while I wait for season 3
<alexxm> i saw the new karate kid just for jackie chan Obsidian
<Om> GilDash: I don't wana.

<Litwick> Shizuka's drunk, never mind.
*otakon hugs Shizuka
<otakon> LOST IN SPACE!!!!!!!!!!!
<icybeauti> portal 2 would approve
<Shizuka> 13not drunk either
<|Discord|> I like this so far
<Shizuka> 13i am certain drunk shizu would be horrifying...
<HatsuneMikuFan> Where is Space Core?
<DerpStar> Japanese population opens Chinese restaurant in space... INCONCIEVABLE
<otakon> |Discord|: this is CLASSIC stuff man, classic
<Irish_Pony> Shizuka: So...your not willing to try it? :'(
<RustyMeat> FUCKING
<icybeauti> ADIDAS!
<DaringDude> kenne:
<otakon> DerpStar: I dunna think you know what word what you think it means...
<Derpy_hooves> :V
<|Discord|> otakon: This is better than the current stuff
<Litwick> This is sober Shizu, imagine DRUNK Shizu.
<Ponies47> Bye bye icybeauti :)
<Rain> I agree entirely with what you mean, Shizuka. I wont drink or do drugs for the exact same reason.
<icybeauti> Ponies47: Later

<Ponies47> icybeauti: Are you leaving? You said bye in spanish
<otakon> curse you buffer!
<Irish_Pony> O_O
<Irish_Pony> dem eyes
<CK|Ded> I'm pretty sure drunk Shizu would be amusing, myself, since normal Shizu is friendly and usually drinking just amplifies your normal behavior to silly levels.
<otakon> Man, The Captain is SO badass
<icybeauti> Ponies47: :D I'm not leaving. That's the name of a korn song. Look it up
<Irish_Pony> O____O
<Irish_Pony> Those eyes....

<Ponies47> icybeauti: O I see. I'm not leaving wither :P
<Litwick> The eyes...
<otakon> Irish_Pony: I know man, they look..........off.

<RustyMeat> WHAT WASW THAT?
<Irish_Pony> btw Sumica .... Your cutie mark is an Ace???
<icybeauti> Ace is the name of one of my book charecters ironically.
<Stormman3100> I must be pathetic, I just fell while sitting down in my own chair... fml... :'(
<Sumica> 00,10it started off as a draftsmans compass but yeah
<Woodenfan> I remember an anime scene where a guy screams that if a girl doesn't do what he wants, he'll rape her
<Irish_Pony> Sumica: So what does the Ace represent?
<DerpStar> He should get a uniform it would make him much more attractive like that other fighter pilot
<owlicious> does he want her to be raped?
<Sumica> 00,10it's cause I live in vegas =p
<icybeauti> Makes sense
<Irish_Pony> Sumica: So you gamble like a maniac?
<Stormman3100> Sumica Does it suck to live there?
<Sumica> 00,10Or i guess Las Pegisis now
<Sumica> 00,10no I dont gamble at all
<RustyMeat> pegasisisisisisisis
*Rain likes to believe that Sumica's cutie mark is actually a baked good of some kind, but he keeps it covered up with a fake cutie mark for reasons that are his own
<DerpStar> I'm going to get some milk and cookies

<Woodenfan> OH GOD THOSE YAYS SUMICA THOSE YAYS
<icybeauti> What are everypony's cutie marks?
<Stormman3100> Extreme crime rates, you think it would be a bag place to live in.
<Woodenfan> If I had an OC, I'd make it a Leaf. Combo of fluttershy and grovyle or something.
<Sumica> 00,10crime is't that bad here
<Stormman3100> bag place?
