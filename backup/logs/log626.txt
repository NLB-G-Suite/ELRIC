<Wrek> 05its good ^_^
<Invi> Lil_B, wait what?
<otakon17> Not complete either
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: Sewing school?
<Alchemist> Yes thats the one Wrek :)
<AlphaThroughZeta> SRSLY has any one tried splicing rainbow dashs lines so that she says gimme twenty bits
<AlphaThroughZeta> !!!!!!!
<Lil_B> Invi because Angry Birds is worthy of getting an Orchestrated version over everything else appearently :(
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Wait, wait?!
<RAWRity> AJIsAwesome: oh shit, she's late for friendship http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9fwtzGIWZ1qfcanco1_500.jpg
<Invi> Lil_B, yeah... apparently....... I bet they bought it since they want to become a trademark
<Wrek> 05i cant have doom music without this one!
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome scroll up and look at my previous post XD
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Angry Birds is overrated in my opinion.
<Alchemist> nuu, poor bunneh :(
<Wrek> 05all i can hear are arch-viles everywhere >.> <.<
<Lil_B> never played this Physics engine :/
<AlphaThroughZeta> has any one tried splicing rainbow dashs lines so that she says gimme twenty bits
<Eli> angry birds is fun... the frist time you play it, and the first few levels...
<Bronysith> psh
<Bronysith> casuals
<AlphaThroughZeta> some one ANSWER MEEEEEE!!!!!!
<Invi> yeah. it's a simple slingshot game
<Invi> but it gets boring
<RAWRity> Angry Birds is a decent little time waster, but the company behind it is oversaturating. There's AB plushies, fruit snacks, keychains, pillows, EVERYTHING
<Bronysith> fucking casuals
<Invi> ikr?
<AJIsAwesome> Invi: Combine that with various themes, it's the Ipod of CoD.
<Lil_B> it's not really the game that I dpn't like, it's the Company... Rovio thinks they will be as big as Disney... with Plushys, Cartoons and Coockboocks all out or in the making
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: Agreed.
<Lil_B> Cookbooks*
<Invi> AJIsAwesome, you mean CoD of Ipod ^^
<AJIsAwesome> I don't hate Angry Birds, it's just they keep milking it.
<Eli> RAWRity: I'm actually really pissed that you find Angry Bird toys everywhere where I live, but you have to search for ages for a mlp toy :(
<RAWRity> Also, out of morbid curiosity, I watched the "Annoying Orange" TV show on CN. Good christ was it horrendous.
<Invi> Lil_B, megalomania is very common today ^^
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: Same here.
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: Why?:(
<Wrek> 05meh
<Wrek> 05bad one
<Wrek> 05here we go
<RAWRity> AJIsAwesome: like I said, morbid curiosity. Same reason I watched Carebears for an episode.
<Eli> RAWRity: i liked the frist episode of annoying orange, then it gets repetitive
<Bronysith> the hobbits to isengard
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: The new one? How is it?
<Applejack2012> I do not know what Care Bears is about
<Lil_B> I ripped the Doom Samples from the SNES game... if only I had a DAW that could strech samples without transposing them I could make god music with them (they are all awfully short)
<RAWRity> AJIsAwesome: boring as all hell.
*Bronysith sets a tonberry next to Wrek
<Invi> Applejack2012, it's a children TV show without awesome mlp elements

<Invi> Alchemist, wow she is good
<Lil_B> Invi well, 5 may be dedicated to the C64 version which is a COMPLETLY different song ( yet still awesome, maybe even more) and some are Type B and Type C music, but it also didn't counted Remixes that didn't had "Tetris" in the Title like "Soviet Mind Game"
<Eli> though it's an ugly muffin
<Alchemist> Eli: you cant have that muffin, she accidentally ate it: http://derpy.me/PdXPy

<Lil_B> trying to recreate a guitar in the Oeatmeal VST Synth... i did in once somehow, but the safe file doesn't work
<Alchemist> and this one just makes ma laugh http://derpy.me/Zw1Z8 :D
<Alchemist> dont know exactly why
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: Don't get me wrong, but that joke has been run into the ground.
<flutter_spin> bah. My text is all goofy. I think my flash broke
<Alchemist> AJIsAwesome: I just came across it yesterday
<alexxm> so is the judge dredd movie good
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: what is that a picture of anyways?
<AJIsAwesome> Alchemist: Oh. That makes sense.
<Bronysith> it seems they are desperate to make a meme out of anything these days
<Alchemist> AJIsAwesome: didnt even know what it was about
<Alchemist> AJIsAwesome: the news didnt report it in my country
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: i still find it pretty funny... just because i find it hard to believe they let her do it, and that she didn't realise she has no talent
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: It was a terrible attempt at a resotration of a famous picture of Jesus by an amateur artist.
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: and tehy made it official?
<Pinkies4thWall> Is there a mod in chat?
<MASF123> What are you guys talking about?
<MASF123> Wrek just left and I think Sumica is here.
<Pinkies4thWall> Ohai MASF123
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: People have been trying to make this a meme, but it's been really annoying.
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: she's not even an amateur artist... she's jsut an ole lady
<MASF123> Hi Pinkies4thWall
<Pinkies4thWall> Sumica: you in here?
<Applejack2012> hi
<Pinkie_Brony> Applejack2012: hi
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: I know, but they call her an "amateur artist".
<MASF123> Sumica you there?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Oh man, I have really screwed my self over in terms of sleep this holiday :S
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: because otherwise, the shame on them would be greater for letting her do it
<Lil_B> AJIsAwesome I kinda liked the pictures I saw on memebase XD
<AJIsAwesome> I feel bad for her, though. I didn't even laugh at it when I first saw it.:(
<MASF123> I guess he left...he was here a while back.

<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64: I is in a Xbox party with Moopy, and he's wondering when his ban expires.
<AJIsAwesome> poniesareweird: Bye!
<MASF123> I need to refresh
<Pinkies4thWall> Do you know?
<MadSurge> Hello SuperBrony64!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I no see a stream
<MASF123> Pinkies4thWall SUperBron64 is here
<Dovah> no stream?
<MASF123> dunno
<Applejack2012> stream not flowing
<Lil_B> Vordox I finished my Remix of Luna, now I can work in the animation again, I made a CTR (or TRC? :/ ) TV on a chest but I'm not quite satisfied with the design (especially the chest looks WAY too old XD
<Eli> SuperBrony64: sorry, didn't see any steam :(
<MadSurge> Hey Kawaii_icybeauti!
<MLP_Brovakiin> I am in dire need of tea and jaffa cakes, brb
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Ohai MadSurge
<Vordox> Lil_B: Show me later =3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Pinkies4thWall: He was unbanned over a month ago :)
<Lil_B> ok :)
<AJIsAwesome> Is there a stream?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Can you believe back to the future is 2 years from now P
<Kawaii_icybeauti> :P*
<MASF123> Who?
<Pinkies4thWall> I tell him
<MASF123> ...
<MASF123> :(
<MASF123> Ok fine then.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> dafaq is going on?
<tSparx> So, is that a new stream software I see over there, or just reskinned?
<MASF123> I miss KwakLad...I wonder if he comes here anymore.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I see no stream.
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: no sister to play with? =3
<SuperBrony64> 11,02She's at school >>
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Kawaii_icybeauti: Refresh your stream embed
<tSparx> Not the stream, but the like, player. It looks nothing like the one I'm used to.
<MASF123> A stream is up?
<MASF123> I did.
<tSparx> Also I have no stream.
<MASF123> nothing happende
<tSparx> But I don't think anything's up
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Do I like copy the wierd code thing?
<Vordox> Evil stream service is EVIIIIIIL!
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Oh Superbrony, you have MIPS on your end, but it's LimeV on the stream embed
<tSparx> Kawaii_icybeauti: Nah, there is no stream on right now, I don't think
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: But there's still no stream...:(
<thelonepony> stupid asian women ads!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Try again now :)
<tSparx> Kawaii_icybeauti: When there is one, you can click the 'refresh" button right below the player.
<MASF123> ok
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: There we go. =3 You're welcome
<Kawaii_icybeauti> oh there it is
<tSparx> Oh hey, that's the one I'm used to, haha
<MASF123> Refresh is next to pop-out
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Vordox: Yeah, I know, I just swapped it :P
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I had actually pressed refresh multiple times.
<tSparx> Someone ping me, I'm trying out the embedded client
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Silly Ubertechie SuperBrony64 :D
<Kawaii_icybeauti> he said mexico o.O
<AJIsAwesome> Yay, NSMB Wii.
<flutter_spin> Super Mario?
<MASF123> Get 99 lives to get Mario without a Hat.
<Vordox> Kawaii_icybeauti: Didn't you know, Mario is anti mexican
<AJIsAwesome> MASF123: I did that too.:D
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I never knew what the POW did...
<MASF123> The infinite 1-Up glitch is still in this one.
<Vordox> Kawaii_icybeauti: It goes... "POW"
<AJIsAwesome> As good as this game looks graphically, it tends to drag on. Plus the music seems recycled as you keep playing, making it boring.
<MASF123> Wait is SuperBrony64 talking in the stream?
<tSparx> So I know that I'll get a lot of grief for this, but I've never played any Mario games besides Kart and Party
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: No problem.
<flutter_spin> tSparx: I'm worse. I've only played NES Mario
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: You're not really missing much.
<tSparx> Huh, I get no ping noise. That won't work.
<Moopy> Hey guys im back did you all miss me
<MadSurge> YAY NSMB!
<flutter_spin> Same applies to Zelda. I just never went Nintendo past NES
<AJIsAwesome> I rented Wind Waker when I was young, but it was Twilight Princess that got me hooked on Zelda.
<Moopy> hey im sorry what i did back then i just wanted to chat thats all
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: ... i can't agree with you on that one. New super mario bros has always been a great game to me. it's a game that doesn't get old in my opinion
<away-Tsparx> Those smilies sure are cute though.
<MLP_Brovakiin> I have returned with biscuits :) Biscuits for everyone :D
<MadSurge> flutter_spin: do you prefer other companies?
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: That's fine. I think it's a good game. It's just not a game I would keep playing over and over again.
<flutter_spin> its not that. I just never got an SNES, N64, or Wii
<flutter_spin> Without those, no way i can play the games
<MadSurge> Is SuperBrony64 going for a speedrun? :D
<AJIsAwesome> MLP_Brovakiin: Thank you.
<CrimsonPhoenix> OH SHAT SuperBrony64 stream?
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: yep :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> fan neato
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: have you ever played vs on the ds? it's the single most amazing game on a ds. sadly, no one ever challenges me anymore :(
<Moopy> and i promiss i will listen to the mods i pinkie prmiss and i will not be a troll ever again
<flutter_spin> I went through a phase when my mother remarried. Everything had to be "fair" with my stepdad
<Rex_Mundi> Whos streaming?
<flutter_spin> And if my stepsister couldn't play... well I couldn't
<Lil_B> console wise I still go with Nintendo, if though they too do things that make me cringe sometimes, it's the least bad of the 3 console manufactures
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: SB64
<LoGaN> wait who streaming
<tSparx> LoGaN: SB64
<MadSurge> ^
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: You were talking about the DS one? I LOVED the DS one. :O I wish it had online versus, though.
<MASF123|> Piece of crap disconnected
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: I was talking about the Wii one.
<MASF123|> Anyway, is SB64 talking on the stream?
<Dark_Horst> we have a stream and i was not infomred? shame on you! SHAME ON YOU ALL!
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: oh yeah, that would be awesome :) i liked the wii one. but the DS one was better yeah
<flutter_spin> no talking
<AJIsAwesome> Dark_Horst: Hey, there's a stream on!:D
<LoGaN> SuperBrony64: could you do live pony reactions after this? every time you have one its late at night and i cant be involed cause im asleep. just asking...
<tSparx> I don't pick sides in the console war. I love PC, I love all three consoles, but when I have to choose I go Playstation, then Nintendo, then X-Box

<MASF123|> LoGaN yes I do. CCCP because that's the way the game is spelled on the box art.
<CrimsonPhoenix> ^^^^^^At Bronysith
<CCCP> MASF123| oh i downloaded the game so i wouldnt know

<CrimsonPhoenix> 360 is basically, advertisement the console
<LoGaN> MASF123|: friend me wait whats your name
<Bronysith> CAUSE THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE ADVERTISEMENTS
<Bronysith> thats why you pay 50$ a year
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ya yoshi! wooo
<Bronysith> cause they have to pay the advertisers
<MASF123|> CCCP the boxart is still shown when you pick the game on the dashboard :/
<flutter_spin> Sorry. My bro msg me. He was asking about playing Minecraft.
<Vordox> Don't kill Yoshie D:
<Eli> yoshi is my favourite nintendo char of ALL time :)

<Vordox> YOOOOSHIEEEEEEEEE
<Bronysith> YOSHI IS EVIL
<CCCP> i like Red Dead's story more than the multiplayer personaly
<MASF123|> Umm...I dunno.
<CrimsonPhoenix> those hips are too small
<Vordox> Dat porn Bronysith
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Yoshi's story is the first game I can remember. That and pokemon stadium :(
<MASF123|> What are your Gamertags?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and it ain't porn
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's cosplay
<Bronysith> Vordox: thats not porn
<MASF123|> CCCP Agreed.
<tSparx> I don't own any of the current consoles, and I've missed out on SO many good games, like RDR
<CCCP> tSparx: PC
<CrimsonPhoenix> isn't RDR on PC?
<Rex_Mundi> Anyone here who has Rome Tota war should check out EB, ie-the greatest mod for anything ever.http://www.europabarbarorum.com/
<MASF123|> I think it is.
<Eli> Vordox: how is that porn?
<MASF123|> What are your Gamertags...the ones that want to play RED DEAD with me?
<Vordox> Eli: It just is... Ever heard of a "Playful " or "Dirty mind"? :P
<tSparx> (the reason I don't own any of the current consoles is because I'm a poor college kid. even $60 is too much for a game, waiting til RDR goes down in price significantly. If I owned a console, though, I'd rent it from somewhere.)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, that's a perv
<Vordox> Is it hard controlled, SuperBrony64 ?
<Kawaii_icybeauti> how did this get to porn o.O
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Hard controlled?
<Eli> Vordox: well, your opinion i guess. i don't even find it pretty. more like a turnoff
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Images of sexual content, wether it's suggestive or not = Porn or leads to it =P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox comment a Jessica Rabbit cosplay pic porn
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Hard to control Mario
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Not really
<CrimsonPhoenix> Vordox, you have a loose definition of porn
<CCCP> people would be much more peacful if they were Asexual
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: The world is lose, not me =P
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Don't help him.:D
<CrimsonPhoenix> for me it's the moment a genital is present in the pic it's porn
<tSparx> haha
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: I think that's too tight.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> CrimsonPhoenix: True dat
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Inb4 World Freudism. :P
<Ponies47> Hey everypony O_O
<tSparx> I personally don't try to define porn.
<tSparx> Sup Ponies47 !!!
<RAWRity> CrimsonPhoenix: but what if it's nudity for the sake or realism?
<CCCP> CrimsonPhoenix so then some old epic works of art art porn?
<MASF123|> Last call for RED DEAD REDEMPTION Muliplayer
<CCCP> are*
<Bronysith> MASF123|: dat caps
<Dark_Horst> there is this thing we call tasteful nudity. that aint porn either
<CCCP> hi Ponies47
<Bronysith> dem
<CrimsonPhoenix> RAWRity, CCCP good point
<Kawaii_icybeauti> porn according to urban dictionary: the reason you need a new hard drive.
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: And that's why the world is lose.
<MASF123|> Yup that's how it's spelled
<tSparx> Kawaii_icybeauti: Lawl
<MLP_Brovakiin> MASF123|: I accepted the friend request, just waiting on you now :)
<Bronysith> RAWRity: some of the best art throughout history is nude right?
<MASF123|> What about the other guy?
<Vordox> Bronysith: Technically, yes
<LoGaN> MASF123|: wat ur name?
<Eli> Kawaii_icybeauti: or the reason you GET a hard drive :P
<Vordox> As I said, the world is REALLY lose on words atm, due to saturation and subjectiveness, thereby causing misunderstanding based on tecnical terms.
<Vordox> And that's...World is Lose
<Vordox> loose*
<RAWRity> Bronysith: yes, though back in the day, the Pope actually went ind of batshit, and had the penises of many statues in Italy torn off. Meaning that somehwere, there's a big old warehouse full of cement dongs.
<CCCP> porn is stupid
<Barbetos|AtWork> waaat?
<Barbetos|AtWork> it is not
<LoGaN> CCCP: go die
<CCCP> LoGaN :(
<MLP_Brovakiin> CCCP: Agreed
<tSparx> RAWRity: You don't think they just crumbled them up?
<Eli> LoGaN: don't ever react...
<MASF123|> LoGaN, MASF123
<Eli> over*
<Barbetos|AtWork> LoGaN: wow. I wouldn't go THAT far
<Barbetos|AtWork> We love CCCP here
<RAWRity> tSparx: my idea is funnier
<tSparx> LoGaN: Maybe we don't ask people to day?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Still I would hardly call a cosplay of a classic character straight out porn
<Kawaii_icybeauti> when I went to italy, I remember seeing all the nekkid statues.Being 9 at the time, I laughed extrememly hard at each one.
<tSparx> RAWRity: Oh, my bad. I never let truth get in the way of a joke either, entirely my fault :P
<tSparx> to die*
<Eli> CCCP: it is stupid. but can you really say you don't do it?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kawaii_icybeauti: Haha I still do the same, god I am immature :D
<Kawaii_icybeauti> MLP_Brovakiin: Most humans have the humor of a 12 year old boy at most.
<CCCP> Eli im fairly sure there is no porn of me... one sec
<RAWRity> so yeah, the Vatican is filled with castrated statues.
<Eli> CCCP: :P
<Vordox> Okay, enough talk about porn=/= Nudity/genitals etc etc, Let's get back to within realms of the rules here, would we? :P
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: Agreed.
<CrimsonPhoenix> You started it
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Yeah this chat is getting a little awkward.
<LoGaN> im 13 so my humer is around 6 Kawaii_icybeauti
<MLP_Brovakiin> Kawaii_icybeauti: I find life to be better when you are immature
<AJIsAwesome> I wasn't even paying attention to the conversation.:D
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: It's the Art paradox again, there's no end to it =P
<CCCP> LoGaN u hate me? :(
<LoGaN> MASF123|: invite me
<LoGaN> CCCP: idk
<Bronysith> CCCP: your emotes dont help your case
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Like how I went to the american girl place to meet allie raisemann (I did get to meet her.) And I saw the dolls and wanted them all?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Art Paradox?
<MASF123|> Hold up both of you finishing a mission.
<MASF123|> Almost done.
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: "Everything and nothing is art"
<CrimsonPhoenix> The pic had nothing suggestive
*Stallion_of_War das Mario
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: I disagree
<Eli> sometimes i'm so tempted to spam Bronysith with emotes :P :)
<CCCP> Bronysith im not holding a case and even if i was im pretty sure my arm would be enough to support it off the ground
<Barbetos|AtWork> I like how we had a stream of doom before this
*Stallion_of_War do be do be do be
<Bronysith> CCCP: and thus why LoGaN hates you
<CCCP> :C
<CrimsonPhoenix> It's Jessica Rabbit dammit a bit more and you could say Who framed Jack Rabbit is porn
<Bronysith> CCCP: you're a friggin smartass
<Dark_Horst> guys, the picture was a pinup. at most. those are not porn. there is nothing to discuss
<Stallion_of_War> seaponies
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Her very essence of a depth character was based on her suggestive form and style...
<CrimsonPhoenix> roger rabbit**
<Kawaii_icybeauti> CrimsonPhoenix: Wait, thats what all this is about? Yes, she is suggeststive, but not to the point of being considered porn.
<Vordox> Images tells words. P
<LoGaN> hi Moopy
<AJIsAwesome> Seriously, why are we still on this topic?:D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Kawaii_icybeauti, exactly
<Dark_Horst> well, actually there is a lot to discuss, but that steers off into different directions
<AJIsAwesome> If you want to argue, PM each other.
<Ponies47> Oh yeah if you wanna know how freshman only day went for me. PM me O_O
<Vordox> Dark_Horst: All over the place, therbey, the World is Loose :P
<MASF123|> Ok I'm hosting just wait.
<Vordox> LARRY KOOPA!
<LoGaN> hi Moopy
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Hmm, I just got back onto the stream and I notice that my old comp isn't liking mips
<Stallion_of_War> neither is mine
<Barbetos|AtWork> what a HACKER
<Moopy> hey logan
<Vordox> You know SuperBrony64 ...Next time you play a game, play on the hardest, and no save, once you die you change game. :D
<Bronysith> no stream?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Each time I have a discussion with you Vordox I have this bitter taste of unsatisfaction because of how blunt you close the subject.
<tSparx> Bronysith: SB64 doing Mario
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: A sec then CrimsonPhoenix
<Bronysith> o there we go
<Bronysith> i had to refresh lol
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Aw, they removed the article. :(
<Barbetos|AtWork> The swim noisein this game reminds me of Donkey Kong. =P
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: The thing is, what is art, and what is not, what is consider art for art sake, and what is consiered not art when it does not want ot be art.
<Vordox> ><
<tSparx> Pop quiz: if all the ice at the North Pole melted, by how much would the sea level rise?
<Vordox> It's a heavy philosiphical discussion, which has no end, due to opinions.
<Ponies47> Is this the new Mario game SuperBrony64 is playing?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I can see that
<Vordox> Ponies47: Nah it's the old MBSWII
<Ponies47> Vordox: Ah
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: Therefore, an art paradox. :(
<Vordox> I hate i, but I cannot deny it's existance.
<Dark_Horst> oh look, past sins has been revised.... wait what, they still work on that?
<Vordox> DAT SPAM
<CrimsonPhoenix> so basically if one would think that Jessica Rabbit cosplay is porn than that individuals has a pervy mind that would influence his opinion.
<Dark_Horst> i thought the whole thing was like... closed case
<Vordox> CrimsonPhoenix: That's one way
<MASF123|> Invite him
<MASF123|> the mailbox guy to the posse
<Bronysith> god
<Bronysith> tidus is so ughhhhhhhh
<Vordox> I personlly would say that JEssica Rabbit was MADE for being suggestive in her core, due to her artstyle, floosy character and what not, "Sexism" is the very basis of her creation
<Vordox> I see that when I watch any picture of it.
<Bronysith> how do i describe tidus? whiny, bitch?
<Vordox> The lines by the creator under the art <--- I like to analyze.
<CK|GW2> Welp.
<CK|GW2> I knew it.
<tSparx> Answer: Not at all! It just so happens that ice, being slightly less dense than water, floats at the top. The amount of ice left below the surface of the water takes up the same volume as the whole ice cube would if melted.
<RAWRity> Bronysith: a walking advertisement for partial birth abortion
<Dark_Horst> the sole purpose of jessica rabbit was to get men drooling over a cartoon character
<Bronysith> RAWRity: how do i snapshot that?
<Dark_Horst> and from what people tell from back then, it worked
<Dark_Horst> still, FAR from porn of any kind
<Bronysith> is everyone still bitching about that jessica rabbit cosplay i posted?
<CK|GW2> Kenpachi's been killed. OFFSCREEN NO LESS. Someone, most likely monsters in GW2, will pay dearly for this. :|
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:<
<RAWRity> CK|GW2: not necessarily dead yet.
<Vordox> CK|GW2: YOU ARSE
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<Champion_of_Harmony> Oh bad luck
<Barbetos|AtWork> What a dick move game
<Vordox> CK|GW2: DON'T SPOIL FOR F*CK SAKE
<RAWRity> CK|GW2: just like I'm damn sure Byakuya ain't totally dead either.
<CK|GW2> I predicted that one, too. >_>
<AJIsAwesome> CK|GW2: What?!:|
<Dark_Horst> Bronysith: dunno, i just throw something in now and then at the keywords "jessica rabbit" "porn" and "art"
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Who is Kenpachi?
<CK|GW2> I knew it was gonna happen. Kubo purposely set up Kenpachi to face the big bad just to kill him.
<AJIsAwesome> CK|GW2: He doesn't even know what his Bankai's name is!:|
<RAWRity> CK|GW2: plus, y'know, Bleach could stand to kill off a few dozen characters
<Dark_Horst> can yield interesting results
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: character from Bleach
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: A character from Bleach.
<Vordox> ...
<Vordox> Fine
<Vordox> You want SPOILERS
<Vordox> I'll remember this
<CK|GW2> RAWRity: I expect they are, actually. The first two are confirmed kills.
<RAWRity> CK|GW2: I refer you to the tried and true standard: Nobody dies in bleach
<Barbetos|AtWork> oops
<Moopy> Hey superbrony64 i got your message from pinkies4thwall on xbox live dude also i got minecraft for the xbox dude
<tSparx> Oh man, they're still updating Bleach? I got to somewhere in the middle of the dude's with the numbers, in the manga, and I went, "NOPE, I AM DONE."
<CK|GW2> RAWRity: Granted, no one's said Kenpachi is dead yet, but given that the big bad has his hand jutting through Kenpachi's skull, I'm calling bullshit if he lives
<Vivix> Maybe his skull was made of jello
<Vordox> But seriously, CK|GW2, Don't spoil stuff
<RAWRity> CK|GW2: wouldn't be the first time somebody lived through something batshit. Remember Hiyori? SHE WAS CUT IN HALF
<AJIsAwesome> CK|GW2: It would be a shame if he died, though.
<CK|GW2> RAWRity: Yeah, I know.
<CK|GW2> RAWRity: But it's the final arc, and Kubo's pissed about that. Killing off characters to be petty is within expectations.
<tigher1001> hello every one
<tSparx> CK|GW2: Wait, Bleach is ending!?
<AJIsAwesome> tigher1001: Hello!
<CK|GW2> I actually kinda figure this will be Kubo's version of Countdown or Ultimatum.
<tSparx> Hello tigher1001
<RAWRity> CK|GW2: Personally, I think Kubo's kind of happy about it being the final arc. It's felt like he's hated his own creation for years now.
<WindWhistler|School> Ewww.....why are you playing this game SuperBrony64?
<CK|GW2> tSparx: Yep.
<WindWhistler> Mario is overrated.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WindWhistler: :<
<WindWhistler> :
<AJIsAwesome> WindWhistler|School: Becuase it's a good game?
<WindWhistler> :|
<Vivix> watgeim?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Guess I can't play this anymore cause WindWhistler doesn't liek it ;~;
<CK|GW2> tSparx: The anime's ended and this manga arc is the last one apparently. Sales are down by millions of copies so Shonen Jump is canning it.
<AJIsAwesome> WindWhistler: So you would say he's mainstream?
<tigher1001> who is streaming?
<Barbetos|AtWork> What!
<tSparx> WindWhistler: Not necessarily, you just don't like it. Which is fine, I'm not a huge fan either, but.
<WindWhistler> AJIsAwesome: If by good you mean "the same thing as in every other game"
<Barbetos|AtWork> No keep streaming SB64
<Barbetos|AtWork> Ignore party pooper
<Kandarihu|OldComp> SuperBrony64 of course you can play it.
<CK|GW2> SB64: Octogirl gaem nao pls
<WindWhistler> The mechanics are the EXACT same
<Vordox> WindWhistler: Dude...
<Vordox> WindWhistler: EVERY GAME IS EVERY GAME
<WindWhistler> as in every other game
<RAWRity> inb4 WindWhistler is and avid COD fan
<Vordox> WindWhistler: We MAKE it good, not other way around
<WindWhistler> RAWRity: nope.avi
<Vivix> Now I'm curious *openstream
<Vivix> And always remember, just because something is wellmade, does not mean everyone will like it
<WindWhistler> We need more Luigi games
<Vordox> WindWhistler: Guess what...
<Vordox> WindWhistler: YOU PRESS RIGHT TO WALK RIGHT
<WindWhistler> Luigi's Mansion was different.
<Vordox> Wait wait WAIT WindWhistler I have the PERFECT VIDEO FOR YOUR Attitude
<Vivix> Ah, mother was a huge fan of this
<CK|GW2> Also, Vordox: >implying you were masochistic enough to torment yourself by reading the last arc of a series that stopped being good years ago.
<tigher1001> who is streaming
<Vordox> CK|GW2: The manga JUSt came out
<CK|GW2> Only someone like me is so bold as to torture myself like that. >_>
<Vordox> It's like screaming spoilers of a movie on it's openning night CK|GW2
<Rex_Mundi> CK|GW2: What series are we talking about?
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: I think I know what video you're talking about.
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: Sellout Mario
<Kandarihu|OldComp> WindWhistler, you talk about how every game in the Mario series has the same mechanics, as we're watching Mario with a propeller on his head doing super-boosted spin jumps. In my book, I'd call that NEW
<CK|GW2> Vordox: No, it's like screaming "Bella marries Edward" on the night of Breaking Dawn Part 2's opening
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: Oh. I thought you were talking about the video from Dorkly.
<tSparx> I really, really enjoyed Bleach, and I was worried it was just going to get to Inuyasha levels of "This should've ended years ago."
*Sumica flips a table in a fit of rage
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: It is
<Vivix> Bella marries Edward?
<Vivix> I thoguht she died
<Barbetos|AtWork> Vivix: almost
<Vivix> Aah
<Vordox> Vivix: What is dead in that movie? =P
<Vivix> I haven't seen the last one
<Vivix> Hehehe, true
<WindWhistler> Nice job Vordox, you almost made my browser crash with that link
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: Oh.
<Rex_Mundi> Oh, bleech, I lost interest inthat series at the filler arc where the Zanbato rebel or something of that ilk.
<Barbetos|AtWork> But Edward turns into a vampire and saves her at the last second for our continued pain
<WindWhistler> I don't care if the game is mainstream
<Eli> wat? are we seriously talking about twilight now?
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: The way you titled it sounded like something different.
<Vivix> Aah
<Vivix> Twilight isn't any worse than anyo ther teen movie- so I didn't mind seeing it
<Eli> that's what i get for fetching me a muffin :P
<CK|GW2> tSparx: It already did. Really, the Arrancar stuff dragged on too long, if it had concluded faster and ended right there, the series would have been better for it.
<Vordox> AJIsAwesome: It's called Sellout Mario :P
<tigher1001> FUN FACT : that witch is actualy a boy
<tSparx> Arrancar, that's the arc I dropped at, yeah.
<Ihop> is anyone excited for dr who saterday
<Rex_Mundi> The Hunger games are a teen movie and its 100times better than Twilight
<AJIsAwesome> Vordox: I saw it on Youtube as "Mario is too mainstream".
<RAWRity> CK|GW2: actually it's more like shouting "This movie is gonna suck for anybody who's not a sexually repressed teenage or middle age girl!" at Breaking Dawn part 2
<Lil_B> I like Mario, I like that they trry to make new games with new mechanics, but the recent 2D Super NMario Titles and Super Mario 3D land just look so damn bland... I mean, Good grafics, good sound, but no soul, no personality -.-
<tSparx> In the manga, I never watched much of the anime.
<tigher1001> Ihop: oh god i REALY have to catch up
<CK|GW2> RAWRity: ....point
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Bowser Jr. is second worst character in the Mario Universe.
<WindWhistler> Lil_B: Exactly my point
<Eli> tSparx: i just read the last chapter. i hope they're gonna make some decent last chapters, and then leave it be
<WindWhistler> The new games are just the old ones with better graphics
*Ponies47 Huggles dat SuperBrony64 :3
<WindWhistler> and one or two new things thrown in
<Barbetos|AtWork> SuperBrony64: then who is the worse?
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: right behind Toad
*SuperBrony64 huggles dat Ponies47 back :3
<WindWhistler> Which get old REALLY fast
<Barbetos|AtWork> oh hai Ponies47
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Waluigi
<Barbetos|AtWork> lol
<tigher1001> who i streaming this game???
<pony_6776> Hi
<tigher1001> is
<WindWhistler> Now Luigi's Mansion...that was something completely different
<AJIsAwesome> tigher1001: SuperBrony64.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02hai pony_6776 :)
<WindWhistler> And Super Mario Galaxy was also interesting
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Gello!
<Barbetos|AtWork> I want a new Wario game
<WindWhistler> It provided something new
<CK|GW2> RAWRity: But yeah, I don't actually know of anyone who reads the series for enjoyment any more. It's mostly just people like me who feel some odd compulsion to know how it ends, even knowing it will undoubtably suck.
<tSparx> tigher1001: SuperBrony64
<tigher1001> AJIsAwesome: Thx
<AJIsAwesome> *Hello*
<JESmith71> Kinda irrelevant to have both Bowser Jr and the Koopalings in this
<Lil_B> WindWhistler yes
<Ponies47> Hey Barbetos|AtWork freshman only day has my mind so full of buck right now
<Barbetos|AtWork> Infact the recent super mario bros game, with the coins and everything, would of made a better wario game
<WindWhistler> Now they're just remaking the same old games...
<RAWRity> CK|GW2: considering where Bleach has been in the popularity polls the last couple years, it seems that way.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Whoops.:$
<Eli> Barbetos|AtWork: i really enjoyed the Wario lands
<Vordox> WindWhistler: Dude... Every game is every game =P
<Vordox> Enjoy stuff for what it is, not for what i can be
<WindWhistler> It's forgivable if the series is only a couple of games
<Ponies47> Ohai pony_67.... Gone
<Hat> Mario games are good
<Kandarihu|OldComp> WindWhistler, point taken. But keep in mind that Nintendo has had a lot of anecdotes about how "different" to make a game, especially with everything that happened over Zelda II.
<WindWhistler> But this series has been around for like...20 years
<CK|GW2> RAWRity: Yeah, hasn't it lost over a million readers a year since '08 or sommat?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Eli I enjoyed it a lot too. I did not even mind the eye bleeding from the virtual boy I liked it so much
<tigher1001> WindWhistler: it seemes like in movies/games there isnt much originality
<CK|GW2> RAWRity: Arterial bleeds can't match that sort of speed.
<Vivix> There isn't, but there will be at times
<Ihop> One Piece > Bleach
<tSparx> WindWhistler: people enjoy it. You and I don't. We aren't right, they aren't right either.
<tigher1001> WindWhistler: any more
<AJIsAwesome> Everyone has different opinions. There's always going to be diagreement one way or another.
<Vivix> Just because nothign seems original, does not mean that we shuld accept it
<Hat> AJIsAwesome: I disagree
<RAWRity> CK|GW2: It's lost something like 2 million in Volume sales since 2009, and it's been consistently in the bottom 5 popularity wise cor 18 months, save when it gets a color page.
<Vivix> Hehehe
<tSparx> Hat: *facepalm*
<WindWhistler> OMG LUIGI'S MANSION 2 PREVIEW!?
<WindWhistler> CLICK IT SuperBrony64
<Eli> Ihop: yeah. right now, Fairy tail and One Piece are my favourites
<AJIsAwesome> How was Luigi's Mansion 2?
<thelonepony> ^^
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MOOO o3o
<alexxm> moo
<RAWRity> Fairy Tail is still somehow worse than Bleach though.
*Bronysith glomps SuperBrony64
<WindWhistler> What about the Luigi's Mansion preview? D:
<tigher1001> drum roll
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: You're a duck, right?
*WindWhistler shoves BronySith out of the way
<Ihop> Eli: good
<CK|GW2> I've had people recommend One Piece to me but I could never get into the early stuff. When I first tried it was too goofy and out there for me to enjoy proper.
<WindWhistler> ONLY I CAN GLOMP HIM
<tigher1001> dadadaddadaddadadaddadada and its?
*WindWhistler glomps SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AJIsAwesome: I'm a poneh :D
<tigher1001> ...
<WindWhistler> .............
*SuperBrony64 hugs WindWhistler back ^-^
<tigher1001> oh god
<Vordox> O GOD
<WindWhistler> Somehow this is even worse than the new Mario games
<Hat> Du du just dance
<Rex_Mundi> Im almost positive that fallout 4 will be set in Boston, it turns out that MIT has a video game department, and a lot of the guys at Bethesda went there. And now Bethesda is known to be researching Boston. Plus "the institute" is based on MIT.
<Vordox> SuperBrony64 don't torture your body D:
<tSparx> CK|GW2: I'm the exact same way.
<JESmith71> I'm out for now. Have a funeral to go to
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Oh, shoot! I was so close.....:D
<Lil_B> New Super Marario bros Wii summed up for me is: Generic 2D Platformer with Mario and Luigi with new Powerups decent design, decent music" ... thats it, nothing that really makes me interested, like SM galaxy, or at leat the Coin Rush thing looks like a interesting change of persopective
<tigher1001> -_-
<Lil_B> perspective*
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64, I'm holding a gun to my head
<tigher1001> lol
<Eli> RAWRity: WHAT? fariy tail is so much better than bleach. at least in it's current state
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: Bye.:(
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WindWhistler: ;~;
<Bronysith> time to browse my favorite sub reddit
<tigher1001> WindWhistler: good idea
<RAWRity> CK|GW2: I love one Piece, but the early chapters are a little uneven between action and goofiness. Until the Arlong Park arc, it's just sort of middling. Plus, it's a looooong read.
<tSparx> JESmith71: God bless, good luck.
<WindWhistler> Oh yay now we can see Luigi's Mansion 2 preview! :D
<Lil_B> bye JESmith71 :(
<Vordox> WindWhistler: Go check the video I linked to you.
<JESmith71> My uncle passed on on Sunday
<AJIsAwesome> How was Luigi's Mansion 2?
<Vordox> It'll open your minda bit
<WindWhistler> Vordox: I already told you it almost crashed my browser
<CK|GW2> RAWRity: No kidding. It would take me forever to catch up.
*Hat hugs JESmith71
<Bronysith> Was Captain planet an anime?
<Rex_Mundi> Im never going to do Onepice because i dont want to do something that freaking long. It has like 20 movies for goodness sake.
<CK|GW2> RAWRity: And given my nick, let's just say my free time is spent elsewhere these days. XD
<Vordox> WindWhistler: If anything, thatll make you think twice before saying the game is the same :P if you get it to work
<RAWRity> Bronysith: no
<tSparx> Bronysith: Nope, it's western cartoon
<Ihop> no sith
<Eli> RAWRity: i think it's worth the read. but i follow OP for almost 10 years now :)
<JESmith71> Bronysith: No it was Turner show
<JESmith71> Thank you people.
<tigher1001> OH SHIT IS ABOUT TO GET REAL
<WindWhistler> Vordox: That video is just saying Mario is too mainstream. I don't have a problem with mainstream.
<Vordox> OH ANG
<Hat> Luigi has the worst luck in houses
<Vordox> Luigi!
<RAWRity> Fairy tail: All the poor comedice timing of early One Piece, with all the lazy writing of current Bleach!
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: I wish I could say something, but I can't. He's YOUR uncle, not mine. Sorry. I hope everything goes well.:(
<Bronysith> Hat: its a mansion
<Rex_Mundi> LM had a sequile!:(
<Eulshy> Oooooh new luigi's mansion
<MadSurge> CAKE GHOST
<Vordox> LOOK AT THEM REAL GRAPHICS
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: No, it's *going* to have a sequael
<Vordox> SO AWSOME
<WindWhistler> This looks epic~
<AJIsAwesome> Are those what the ghosts look like?
<Hat> At least Luigi is the star
<MadSurge> Spider is not a ghost!
<WindWhistler> The fact Luigi is the star makes it more awesome
<AJIsAwesome> Or are these Beta ghosts?
<WindWhistler> Because Luigi needs more love
<Barbetos|AtWork> That ghost looked like hand banana
<Barbetos|AtWork> oh my...
<Eulshy> Luigi has more serious adventures
<Vordox> When are you going to buy it, SuperBrony64 ? :D
<Vivix> Ghosts remind me of Worms
<Vordox> LAWl
<WindWhistler> I wish they didn't make Luigi such a coward though...
<Vordox> Elevator Music
<WindWhistler> It makes me feel so bad for him...
*pyrocatboy returns with one side of his mouth numb.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Vordox: When it comes out O.O
<MadSurge> Silent Hill stairs:D
<WindWhistler> Poor guy
<AJIsAwesome> WindWhistler: Agreed.
<Vordox> WindWhistler: ....Seriously?
<Hat> OHWOWOWOW
<WindWhistler> Though the ending of the first game made me laugh
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WindWhistler: But if he was not a coward, then Luigi's Mansion wouldn't be as silly and funny :D
<Vordox> WindWhistler: Luigi is Luigi, Mario is Mario, let them be what they are :P
<WindWhistler> Luigi got his revenge
<tigher1001> I NEED A 3DS NOW
*pyrocatboy returns with one side of his mouth numb.
<Ihop> play the pikin tralir
<WindWhistler> Well I just hate that Mario is getting all the games...
<tSparx> pyrocatboy: We gotcha the first time, Pyro.
<WindWhistler> What about Luigi?
<tSparx> pyrocatboy: What'd you do? Dentist?
<pyrocatboy> yep
<Barbetos|AtWork> pyrocatboy: don't let dentists take advantage of you.
<WindWhistler> Oooh what's that Kirby's Dream Collection?
<AJIsAwesome> I like Luigi as a coward, but they milk it a little too much. He should really only be a coward in the Mansion games only.
<Eulshy> ohohoh new paper mario!!
<Lil_B> WindWhistler I'm so looking forward to this!
<Moopy> hey ponies47 remember me? did you miss me?
<WindWhistler> Yeah his performance in Brawl was pathetic
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: agreed
<Eli> WindWhistler: no kidding. who ever plays him in brawl?
<AJIsAwesome> I miss the badge system in Paper Mario.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Wii U. Still sounds like a question to me.
<WindWhistler> Eli: Oh my cousin does. He's amazing as him
<NocturnalBlade> Eli: i did ^_^
<tSparx> Luigi isn't a coward, he's a scaredy-cat, big difference! The bravest people are the ones who're terrified, but still do what needs to be done; the biggest cowards are those who aren't afraid, but won't do anything.
<Eulshy> I'm pretty sure the badge system is back in the new paper mario
<WindWhistler> Eli: I was just talking about his single scene where King DeDeDe owned him.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This better come to San Francisco and I better be invited :I
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: True.
<Eli> nevermind... I'll jsut stay Ike and shut up :P
<Barbetos|AtWork> tSparx: Luigi is just a moron. He has no idea why he breaks into peoples homes.
<NocturnalBlade> oh btw i'm back
<NocturnalBlade> ^_^
<Lil_B> WindWhistler it's basicly the first Kirby games (Dreamland to Kirby 64) + some special Stages + a Soundtrack CD + a little Trivia
<tSparx> hey NocturnalBlade
<Ihop> wii u is bad idea
<WindWhistler> Barbetos|AtWork: Aren't you mistaking him for Link?
<pyrocatboy> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9j58lWjwA1rq0gqko1_500.jpg My favioute pic
<AJIsAwesome> They were paid to say positive things about t.:P
<tSparx> Ihop: That's what everyone said about the Wii...
<Barbetos|AtWork> WindWhistler: Link knows what he is doing at least. "GET SHINEY RUPEES!"
<AJIsAwesome> *it*
<CrimsonPhoenix> ew Nintendo Land
<WindWhistler> Barbetos|AtWork: But he should be getting sued for millions of rupees
<tSparx> Ihop: I think so too, but mostly I'm just witholding judgement.
<WindWhistler> For destruction of property
<AJIsAwesome> I'm actually pretty excited about the new Wii U.
<Barbetos|AtWork> WindWhistler: It is Hyrule, not america
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^
<Lil_B> Ihop well, it's new, and it actually has quite the potential, Nintendo is (as they always say, but everybody always ignores it) "We create unique things"
<WindWhistler> I just want Pikmin 3 and Rayman Legends
<Vordox> MEgAMAN LEGEND
<tigher1001> PIKMIN 3
<WindWhistler> ROCK PIKMIN ARE ADORABLE
<tigher1001> '??????
<tSparx> MEGAMAN LEGENDS??
<Barbetos|AtWork> RIP Megaman Legends
<CrimsonPhoenix> tSparx, Rayman
<tSparx> Oh :(
<WindWhistler> lol
<Moopy> Hey superbrony64 i sent you a message on your xbox dude
<WindWhistler> Oh hi Perry shirt
<tSparx> I want Megaman Legends 3 so, so baldy.
<Ihop> PIKMIN 3 WII U IS NOW BEST IDEA
<CrimsonPhoenix> they said Rayman Legend
<WindWhistler> Ihop: We've been waiting for it for years.
<CrimsonPhoenix> tSparx, shame it'll never exist
<Barbetos|AtWork> tSparx: the best we are going to get now is a spirtual successor.
<Ihop> sure have
<Lil_B> I heard Capcom is making one big Megaman Collections
<tigher1001> Ihop: HECK YES
<WindWhistler> ......Furry Legends....?
<tSparx> CrimsonPhoenix: Never's a long time. A *long* time. Hell, I'm still holding out for a second Threads of Fate, haha.
<WindWhistler> that sounds wrong...
<NocturnalBlade> WindWhistler: yea, furry legends lol
<MASF123|> Furies?
<WindWhistler> Eeeew Rabbids
<tSparx> I'm hoping that, eventually, the gaming industry will be in a spot like hollywood, where they pick up old franchises.
<tigher1001> WindWhistler: Ramon rabbids was my first wii game
*WindWhistler gets the gun out again
<CrimsonPhoenix> then it'll be horrible
<pyrocatboy> tSparx And make shitty remakes?
<WindWhistler> oh wait nevermind
<tSparx> Because I want Threads of Fate II and Legend of Dragoon II and Megaman Legends 3 and...
<Lil_B> well... in 2011 the gaming industrie made more money than the movie industry
<Barbetos|AtWork> We are talking about furries and Rabbids. something tells me that this is about to turn into an admission of a sick fantasy.
<AJIsAwesome> Yay, we get to see SuperBrony64 danc- oh wait, nevermind.
<Champion_of_Harmony> Play....Pokemon!
<WindWhistler> I still can't find my Skylanders game...
<tSparx> pyrocatboy: Well, obvsiously, I want them to do better than Hollywood :P
<tigher1001> plz be ssbb
<WindWhistler> Champion_of_Harmony: All the Pokemon games for the Wii suck.
<tigher1001> awwww
<WindWhistler> YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
<MadSurge> YES
<MadSurge> YEEEEEESSSSSSS
<Champion_of_Harmony> not revolution
<Ponies47> Oh yeah in all did I have fun at freshman only day? NO! :[
<AJIsAwesome> How was Skylanders? Is it any good?
<tigher1001> still good
*WindWhistler spazzes and foams at the mouth like the foamy mouth guy
<WindWhistler> AJIsAwesome: It's awesome
<thelonepony> chat derp?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I like Skylanders :)

<RainbowDash> hihi all

<tSparx> Alrighty, as awesome as Rayman O would be, I must depart. Farewell!
<AJIsAwesome> Just wanted to know. :)
<WindWhistler> I'm surprised it got a sequel so quickly...
<thelonepony> hai RainbowDash
<MadSurge> Ohai RainbowDash!
<Eulshy> cool rayman
<CrimsonPhoenix> WindWhistler, it's Activision
<NocturnalBlade> bye tSpa...danr it
<NocturnalBlade> *darn
<Champion_of_Harmony> *is thinking of getting skylanders for 3ds just for "Dark Spyro"*
<Ponies47> Hello Rainb.......
<Barbetos|AtWork> Rayman - a cracked out hyper version of pit fall
<WindWhistler> Champion_of_Harmony: I wouldn't.
<WindWhistler> Champion_of_Harmony: Dark Spyro is only different in the 3DS version...and the 3DS game isn't that good...
<WindWhistler> The console games are better.
<NocturnalBlade> dat fairy
<pony37938> hi moopy if you can see me
<AJIsAwesome> Can't you attack the sisters?
<Champion_of_Harmony> Why do the faries have huge tits?

<Eulshy> them fairies
<Vordox> Champion_of_Harmony: Cause.
<WindWhistler> Champion_of_Harmony: They're bodacious nymphs
<Moopy> hey dude
<WindWhistler> NYMPHS
<Barbetos|AtWork> Why is her face derped?
<WindWhistler> GET IT RIGHT
<tigher1001> DAT DERP EYES
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Champion_of_Harmony: Because they are the bodacious nymphs.
*WindWhistler spazzes
<NocturnalBlade> WindWhistler: ah, my mistake lol

<Dark_Horst> oh, rayman
*SuperBrony64 is petted ^_^
<tigher1001> I MISS DERPY
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Won't the nymphs attack you if you attack them?
<CrimsonPhoenix> You haven't seen their hips?
<pyrocatboy> Has anyone played Ocarina of Time the 3ds? How are the controls?
<pony37938> sir derps alot?
<MadSurge> SURPRISE, NEW LEVELS
<WindWhistler> AJIsAwesome: No. They're friendly
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64 likes being petted :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> pyrocatboy, they're alright
<SuperBrony64> 11,02pyrocatboy: I played it, they are pretty good :D
<WindWhistler> pyrocatboy: it's good for me.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ponies47: Moo :3
<Eulshy> PADDLE FASTER I HEAR BANJOES
<Ponies47> SuperBrony64: Moo :3
<AJIsAwesome> Oh. I heard they would.
<Champion_of_Harmony> right...and are you serious only on 3ds? so even If I had dark spryo and put him on xbox he be regualr spyro?
<Moopy> try backing out and type in your user name
<WindWhistler> Champion_of_Harmony: No. He'll still be dark Spyro. But his attacks are the same as regular Spyro
<Eulshy> ded
<WindWhistler> On the Wii
<tigher1001> SuperBrony64: Oink
<WindWhistler> But on the 3DS he has a different set of moves
<WindWhistler> And the 3DS game isn't worth it.
<Champion_of_Harmony> Oh, okay then
<CrimsonPhoenix> Skylanders will probably be the one game I would despise the most
<Eulshy> Secret door
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Because they make you pay to get figures to play the game?
<CrimsonPhoenix> WindWhistler, yes
<MASF123|> Furries? Wut.
<MadSurge> Eulshy: the food level nymph is even plumpier than the rest :D
<pyrocatboy> What about Resident Evil: Revelations? Is that a good game?
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Considering they're optional...
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's like real life DLC
<Champion_of_Harmony> Well you only need one of each class to access the doors.
<CrimsonPhoenix> for extra characters?
<tigher1001> dat dance
<WindWhistler> You don't need all the figures to beat the game
<Eulshy> MadSurge, fat nymphs need love too
<CrimsonPhoenix> Where in other games you can select your characters?
<WindWhistler> You can just use the three they give you
<pyrocatboy> What about Resident Evil: Revelations? Is that a good game?
<RainbowDash90> o.O
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Hey, at least they have more than ONE character to play as...
<WindWhistler> There's a wide range of characters to play as...
<Moopy> thats great dude
<MadSurge> Eulshy: she's the RIGHT plumpy kind of woman :D
<WindWhistler> And they already give you three of them.
<tigher1001> i think im done bye evrey one
<Eulshy> MadSurge, exactly
<CrimsonPhoenix> also Spyro is UGLY AS FUCK
<NocturnalBlade> bye tigher1001
<RainbowDash90> lawl @ Moopy
<Eulshy> Nother door
<pyrocatboy> What about Resident Evil: Revelations? Is that a good game?
<CrimsonPhoenix> but that's my opinion
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: You talking about Beta Spyro or the actual Spyro used?
<Marx> So I tried taking on the Super Single Line in Pokemon today.
<Moopy> lawl back
<WindWhistler> Because most people are talking about Beta Spyro...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Beta Spyro?
<AJIsAwesome> Back. My internet derped.
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: The picture of Spyro from when the game was a beta.
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: It was horrifying.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yeah it was
<Marx> On the second round, got stopped short because Garchomp got killed by Lickylicky's Ice Beam.
<Lil_B> ok on September 19th this year Megaman has it's 25th anniverary and there will be a 10CD Soundtrack Collection and more
<RainbowDash90> Facehooves in reply to moopy :P
<WindWhistler> But he looks a lot better in the Alpha
<CrimsonPhoenix> though I admit I haven't seen the actual spyro now that you mention it
<Moopy> thats great
<Champion_of_Harmony> Hmm or maybe just get a legendary pack for it if I get it...
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: He doesn't look that bad. And he has a nice voice.
<MadSurge> Poof
<RainbowDash90> anyway whats yall up to today :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> voice?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Did he really needed a voice?
<AJIsAwesome> RainbowDash90: Hello!
<CrimsonPhoenix> was he voiced in the PSX games?
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Well you can't have them all be silent.
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Did you get my message?
<Moopy> yes i did
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Yup.
<pyrocatboy> Has anyone here played RE:Revalations?
<WindWhistler> Didn't you play any of them?
<CrimsonPhoenix> heeeh guess I can't complain there
<Marx> So I guess the next time you take on the Battle Subway and your Garchomp encounters Lickylicky, switch to Ferrothorn instead.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I still despise the whole concept of skylanders
<CrimsonPhoenix> optional or not
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: I think it's an interesting concept, even though it's a blatant moneymaking scheme.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AJIsAwesome: Where?
<CrimsonPhoenix> WindWhistler, yeah
<WindWhistler> I know they just want my money...
<WindWhistler> But I can't help myself...
<CrimsonPhoenix> blatant money making scheme
*Bronysith glomps SuperBrony64
<MASF123|> I wantz that game! :O
<WindWhistler> Because I like the game.
<Marx> (Yes, I'm kinda cheap using these uber pokemon, but I don't care, as long as they get BP quickly and reliably.)
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Give me one second.
<Eulshy> splish
<RainbowDash90> splash?
<WindWhistler> HE DIED AGAIN?
*SuperBrony64 hugs Bronysith back :D
<WindWhistler> SB stop dying.
<WindWhistler> :|
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Here it is: "Seriously, thank you for streaming this game. This is one of my favorite games to watch AND play.:)"
*WindWhistler slaps SuperBrony64
<Flyboy> is this... rayman?
<WindWhistler> If you don't stop dying, I'll kill you.
<Eulshy> It occurs to me that you need to jump across those enemies to get that coin fingy
<AJIsAwesome> Flyboy: Yep.
*SuperBrony64 is slapped ;~;
<WindWhistler> I miss Gex.
<Flyboy> OH MY CELESTIA
<Moopy> hey rainbow dash90 what happend?
<WindWhistler> WHY CAN'T THEY MAKE A NEW GEX GAME!?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AJIsAwesome: :D
<Flyboy> nostalgia... destroying... body...
<WindWhistler> THEY EVEN PUT Q-BERT IN THE NEW PIXAR MOVIE
<AJIsAwesome> WindWhistler: You can't really kill someone who's already dead.
<WindWhistler> SO WHY NOT GEX
<WindWhistler> AJIsAwesome: that's the point
<Eulshy> Gex was annoying
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah no Spyro is still ugly
<AJIsAwesome> WindWhistler: I know.:D
<Champion_of_Harmony> huh only 52 bucks on amazon...but cant decide, skylanders, red dead, portal 2, or dead space?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and that's from watching a lets play on PS3
<Marx> WindWhistler, That Wrecking Ralph movie?
<JESmith71> Any difference between the Wii and 360/PS3 verisons (Yeah I know I said I was leaving but it turns out I have another 10-15 minutes)
<Flyboy> must...resist...urge...to find... SuperBrony64's... house...
<CrimsonPhoenix> and Wrecking Ralph ain't Pixar
<pyrocatboy> What about Resident Evil: Revelations? Is that a good game?
<WindWhistler> Marx: Yup
<XAX> Flyboy: ._.
<WindWhistler> Flyboy: I already know where he lives. :D
<Eulshy> Door
<Vordox> Oy CK|GW2 , you still herE
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Yes it is.
<Marx> WindWhistler, They got ALL the big video game characters didn't they? Who's next, Solid Snake? Liquid?
<CrimsonPhoenix> WindWhistler, so Tangled is Pixar as well?
<pyrocatboy> BROTHER!
<WindWhistler> Marx: They have some big names with VOICE roles
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Uhhh...yes...
<Eulshy> poof
<CrimsonPhoenix> WindWhistler, nope
<Vordox> Oy CK|GW2 =P
<Lil_B> I'm exited for Wrek it Ralph even if it isn't Pixar, if the Producer and he Director know what tehy are doing and have a good vision, than I don't fear it :)
<WindWhistler> Wait so it's just Disney, not Pixar?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Walt Disney Animation Studios
<WindWhistler> .....................
<CrimsonPhoenix> they turned 3D just recently
<Lil_B> I hear the Super Mario galaxy Overtuere
<WindWhistler> WHYYYYYYYYYYYY!?
<Applejack2012> Hyped for Wreck too
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: Agreed. I hope they'll be able to make good jokes about video games in general.
<CrimsonPhoenix> because
*WindWhistler sobs
<CrimsonPhoenix> Disney
<WindWhistler> WHY IS DISNEY GOING 3D?!
<WindWhistler> DISNEY IS DEAD
<WindWhistler> WAAAAAAAAAAAAH
*WindWhistler dies
<CrimsonPhoenix> heh
*AJIsAwesome uses Phoenix Down on WindWhistler
<CrimsonPhoenix> is Wrecking Ralph good?
<WindWhistler> (I'm spazzing out on purpose. I don't actually feel this way)
*WindWhistler is revived
<Lil_B> CrimsonPhoenix we will se when it comes out i believe :(
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: It sure as heck looks good.
<Eulshy> hey look a coin fingy
<Champion_of_Harmony> ....what about...kingdom hearts? I know that was a good game.
<WindWhistler> They got freaking Q-BERT in it!
<Eulshy> in the ccorner
<CrimsonPhoenix> well what's there to complain
<SirGanjalf> Is stream on?
<XAX> WindWhistler: The kickbots are staring at your soul
<WindWhistler> XAX: thanks for the warning.
<NocturnalBlade> SirGanjalf: yes
<SirGanjalf> thanks NocturnalBlade
<WindWhistler> maybe I should see how many kicks I can get in a row...
<WindWhistler> There's a lot of mods on...
<WindWhistler> Whaddya say? Should I try?
<MadSurge> Not worth it
<CrimsonPhoenix> though I heard Tangled was pretty mediocre
<Eulshy> secret door
<AJIsAwesome> They have Eggman in it. FREAKING EGGMAN. I'm pretty sure Bowser was a given for that movie, but NOT Eggman.
<SirGanjalf> Oh Rayman
<WindWhistler> AJIsAwesome: I hear Sonic is also in it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, Robotnik
<CrimsonPhoenix> WindWhistler, woah there
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Does it really matter at this point?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I heard villains are in
<Spademagnes[R]> Oh great... my stream keeps buffering
<CrimsonPhoenix> but hero?
<Spademagnes[R]> I hate this computer
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Nope, Eggman. It's his modern design.
<WindWhistler> He's the same person.
<WindWhistler> LOL FAIL
<CrimsonPhoenix> while Q'Bert is one he's quite old
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: I can't believe people still remember him.
<WindWhistler> SO WHERE'S GEX AND BANJO AND KAZOOIE?!
<WindWhistler> AND WHERE'S PARAPPA THE RAPPER?@
*WindWhistler spazzes
<JESmith71> Mario's not in it because it was more expensive than the Bowser cameo
<MadSurge> To me he's still Robotnik :D
<Rex_Mundi> Comix zone
<AJIsAwesome> WindWhistler: One word: Microsoft.
<Eulshy> door
<Spademagnes[R]> Just how much did it cost to get rights from nintendo and sega?
<WindWhistler> Oh yeaaaah...
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't think any FAMOUS hero would be in
<WindWhistler> But where's GEX?!
<WindWhistler> Gex has been dead for far too long!
<AJIsAwesome> WindWhistler: Plus, Nuts and Bolts.
<Dovah> what's the current discustion about?
<WindWhistler> At least B-K got revived...
<CrimsonPhoenix> QBert is a classic
<WindWhistler> And Crash. And Spyro
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gex isn't
<CrimsonPhoenix> as much
<Spademagnes[R]> FUCKING STREAM! Why computer WHY!
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Darn. You're right.
<NocturnalBlade> This will settle it...his name is Doctor Ivo Robotnik aka Doctor Eggman...so either way is fine ^_^
<WindWhistler> hey number 350
<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: Agreed.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Double kick
<MadSurge> NocturnalBlade: Yesh
<Spademagnes[R]> I call him Doctor Ivo "eggman" robotnik
<Rex_Mundi> What bout Ecco the dolphine, those Genesis games are the ultimate unrecognized/unremembered classics.
<NocturnalBlade> Spademagnes[R]: good enough lol
<WindWhistler> Well that was weird
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: "It's Super Effective!"
<CrimsonPhoenix> but seriously from what I've seen
<NocturnalBlade> AJIsAwesome and MadSurge thats from the wikipedia page ^_^
<CrimsonPhoenix> no Hero
<Spademagnes[R]> God damn it stream stop fucking up.... man I need a new computer
<Champion_of_Harmony> Cant wait to see rise of Guardians.
<AJIsAwesome> NocturnalBlade: Still, I like that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> just people fan-gasming and pointlessly dreaming of seeing their favorite character so they can fangasm some more
<WindWhistler> Disney must have a lot of money to spare if they could get so many popular characters in there...
<WindWhistler> Chun-Li is in the movie.
<WindWhistler> Isn't she a hero of some sort?
<Rex_Mundi> So, I tend to devolpe massive crushes on ponies, and I realize that im OK with that.
<Spademagnes[R]> And her thunder thighs?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Pic
<Spademagnes[R]> Rex_Mundi: not alone my friend
<NocturnalBlade> WindWhistler: eeyup, Street Fighter lol
<Flyboy> would have thought we would be watching the paralympic opening ceremony. oh well
<Spademagnes[R]> I assume M Bison is in it
<AJIsAwesome> I've seen image macros of Wreck-it Ralph. They're hilarious.:D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Of course Vega is in it
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/09/the-familiar-faces-of-wreck-it-ralph
<MadSurge> BEST LEVELS
<Eulshy> Dat chest
<MadSurge> LOOK AT ALL THOSE TRAPS <3
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: See Chun-Li?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I see....
<WindWhistler> Isn't she a hero?
<pony_4050> Rayman Origins?
<pony_4050> Is the Wii U out?
<CrimsonPhoenix> well it is a fighting game
<SpadeMagnes[R]> My computer has to be broken or something because the stream keeps pausing
<Rex_Mundi> SpadeMagnes[R]: Truly, its just so damn easy to fall in love with those ponies.
<Eulshy> Stab
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the MAIN hero of Street Fighter are Ryu and Ken
<WindWhistler> Oh oh! Ken is in there!
<WindWhistler> And he has a speaking role
<CrimsonPhoenix> WindWhistler, where have you seen that?
<MadSurge> Eulshy: who's your fav/least fav pony btw?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So close
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/19/sonic-street-fighter-characters-confirmed-for-wreck-it-ralph
<WindWhistler> oooh, Ryu has a speaking role too...
<Eulshy> MadSurge Fav is Sweetie Bell, least fav is Rainbow dash
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Just to confirm its my shit computer the stream isnt pausing for anyone else is it or lagging?
<pony_4050> I got random lags, as well
<WindWhistler> SpadeMagnes[R]: It's lagging tons here
<CrimsonPhoenix> well fuck me
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: BWA HA HA
<MadSurge> Eulshy: glad we agree on the least fav :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Oh so it isnt just me
<CrimsonPhoenix> Sonic is actually in it
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: What?:O
<WindWhistler> Lol that was awesome.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but one said it was only rumored
<Rex_Mundi> My fav pony at this very moment is rarity, but that changes all the time. My least fav is granny smith, i actually dont like her. Dont care for Snips and Snails either.
<WindWhistler> But Ryu and Ken do have speaking roles.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Snips and snails are morons
<WindWhistler> That much we do know~
<CrimsonPhoenix> I have to admit I don't know how to feel about this
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I knew Eggman was in it, but I'm not sure about Sonic.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Ohai DeathMaidBot :3/
*WindWhistler is proud that she got CrimsonPhoenix to react.
<WindWhistler> I AM THE WINNER
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Were all those spike really nessicary??
<WindWhistler> SpadeMagnes[R]: Yes, yes they were.
<WindWhistler> Lol Rayman is glomping the crystal
<Rex_Mundi> is it constantly buffering for you people too?
<CrimsonPhoenix> WindWhistler, you're quite a dick
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Rex_Mundi: yep
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: I'm a female so I can't be one of those. :P
<NocturnalBlade> Rex_Mundi: yea, from time to time
<CrimsonPhoenix> acting all proud about some trivial thing
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: It was a joke. :{
<Tovler> This isn't Rhythm Heaven :'(
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Ok can we all relax here
<Eulshy> need more cheast running
<WindWhistler> Why would I be so proud of something like that?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Thats not how you spell monkey
<AJIsAwesome> I think we all need to calm down.:S
<CrimsonPhoenix> I asked that myself
<AJIsAwesome> DAT BLINKING
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What's going on in here? :I
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix: Well now you know I was just kidding.
<pony_4050> I ADORE the art style in this game
<Rex_Mundi> This game reminds me of earthworm Jim
<pony_4050> It is so fluffy!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yeah
<WindWhistler> CrimsonPhoenix took something I said seriously so I'm explaining to him.
<WindWhistler> Okay so we're all on the same page now?
<CrimsonPhoenix> I take everything seriously and at heart when I'm acting serious
<AJIsAwesome> Silly Rayman! That's not how you spell Ponies.
<Rex_Mundi> Is Foamy the squirle singing in the background?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WindWhistler and CrimsonPhoenix, please stop arguing.
<NocturnalBlade> Rex_Mundi: i think so yes
<Rex_Mundi> :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64, kinda late for that
<Eulshy> i win the argument
<WindWhistler> We were arguing? O_o
<Eulshy> cause i win
<WindWhistler> Okay Eulshy, have a trophy
<NocturnalBlade> Rex_Mundi: or he is just thinking of something cause it sounds like he is going "ummm ummm ummmmmmm"
<CrimsonPhoenix> and yeah we weren't really arguing
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Either way, I said stop it.
<Eulshy> WOOOH
<Eulshy> Trophy
<WindWhistler> SuperBrony64: I'm sorry. D:
<CrimsonPhoenix> and we have before you warned us
<WindWhistler> Will a hug make you feel better?
<Eulshy> I'm really digging this background hum
<Eulshy> aww
<WindWhistler> Yikes, I think I just put everyone in a bad mood.
*WindWhistler slinks away....
<Eulshy> Now Rayman is gone
<CrimsonPhoenix> WindWhistler, you haven't really done anything wrong
*SuperBrony64 hugs WindWhistler
<WindWhistler> Oh phew...
<WindWhistler> I was worried.
<NocturnalBlade> its ok WindWhistler you is forgiven ^_^
*WindWhistler hugs SuperBrony64 back

*WindWhistler pauses stream
<thelonepony> wait south park. i liek
<WindWhistler> Ewww Comedy Central...
<WindWhistler> They sucked after they took off MST3K
<WindWhistler> And this is after MST3K switched to Sci-Fi...
<Vivix> I thouht MSt3K sounded really cool by description, but when I watched it--it was so boring
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Vivix> to each their own
<WindWhistler> Vivix: You probably watched the wrong episodes
<Vivix> I dunno, they were just too long
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Woah Skippage
<WindWhistler> Vivix: Try the short "Johnny at the Fair"
<SirGanjalf> Oh hey Christmas episode
<Vivix> It was some space sci fi movie?
<twilight_sprinkle> mst3k and rifftrax dont make enough good jokes in the hours they have
<Vivix> I've seen or well, heard quotes, from some of the ones Shizuka streams at times
<Champion_of_Harmony> Is the tsream messing up? It seems like its skiping.
<Vivix> like during HP origina lstream, and yeah not for me I htink
<WindWhistler> The cast was on a roll in "The Final Sacrifice" and "Space Mutiny"
<Vivix> I might give a short one a chance just in case, so yeah
<WindWhistler> Vivix: I recommend "Johnny at the Fair" it's only 10 minutes and it's hilarious.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02lol
*Vivix writes it down in notepad
<twilight_sprinkle> is anyone else getting an occasional lag?
<twilight_sprinkle> guess not.

<Bronysith> Twiluna is best shipping
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: BUt don't forget the fact that they become stronger from the expierences. Plus, if they didn't go through these things, they never would've been the characters we know and love today.:)
<Buytoast> people fluffed up nightmare horse so much that they need to say she's the best character so that the canon version doesn't alter their precious fanon version
<Kandarihu|OldComp> I wouldn't be surprised if Derpy Hooves accrues more screentime via cameos than Luna did in the 3 episodes she appeared in.
<otakon> LoGaN: okay...
<LoGaN> hi
<otakon> Kandarihu|OldComp: well BG's do not count
<Canadian_Brony> otakon yeah. "Luna Eclipsed' shows more of Luna than the entire series shows of Celestia
<Vivix> Celestia shouldn't meddle in the business of mortals, her backing off kinda makes sense
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> if they ever make another NMNight episode i wanna see Luna in Sheperd's armor :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AJIsAwesome: Obviously not, Rarity still acted spoiled even after learning her lesson.
<Chrysalis> you know what
<Chrysalis> i just want more ponies
<Chrysalis> SEASON 3 SEASON 3 SEASON 3 SEASON 3
<NocturnalBlade> ^
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: well true, that's she's a serious, if slightly out of touch character that does know how to have a good time.
<LoGaN> season 3?
*Chrysalis repeates BUCK chant
<otakon> Chrysalis: soon
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Suited for success?
<twilight_sprinkle> aw but i wub Rarity
<Bronysith> just imagining luna and twilight kissing eachother as they share their saliva covered mouths together as sweat drips around their warm fur as luna slowly kisses down twilights neck ever closer to her....Im sorry what was i talking about?
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: :S
<CCCP> Rarity is the only character that i personally think is slightly complex but im not sure if its all intentional
<otakon> Bronysith: ... the HELL
<JRP> SuperBrony64: wheres me stream

<Bronysith> otakon: YOU DONT SAY
<CCCP> haha
<Chrysalis> i like the twiluna ship even more than otakon x _____ ships
<Chrysalis> they are soooo cute
<twilight_sprinkle> whoever linked that spanish flea video a few days ago, i salute you again
*LoGaN hugs CCCP and appologizes for being a dick
<Chrysalis> hmm
<CCCP> LoGaN tanks C:
<Chrysalis> is that still a rule
<RainbowDash90> meep
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: spanish flea?
<Canadian_Brony> Bronysith he doen't say. He typed that. If he said it, you wouldn't hear it.
<Chrysalis> or can we give otakon to UPS again?
<otakon> ...
<otakon> NO
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle lol why?
<Chrysalis> no its not a rule?
<otakon> I am not getting shipped with everything in God's green Earth again.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYxbSRpVJ3s&feature=watch_response i can listen to that song for hours
*LoGaN admits hes a big dick everypony so make fun of me while you can!!!!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: its a very fun song :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I mean, just think about it, she complains about boasting in Boast Busters yet boasts when she has her wings in Sonic Rainboom.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: oh that
<CCCP> Is there still a stream?
<otakon> SuperBrony64: I don't know
<otakon> CCCP: no
<CCCP> oh!
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: the show lacks consistency my brother
<Canadian_Brony> please no more shipping. I'll end up as the new otakon
<Vivix> She does, and that's why many people like Trixie
<CCCP> ty otakon
<otakon> Shizuka! Are you there oh mighty Pyro?
<Bronysith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Uz1icjwrM
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> man i LOVE this harmonica tune,kinda sad http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWzHLpM2DZg
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6f5Dz19Bk&feature=g-vrec
<Vivix> It's not a consistency error rather than a show of doublestandards, which is common
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Vivix> claming it is cont. error is simpsons league nerdery
<Metronome> So stream is over..... :'( Random video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewDMPLRvzl0
<LoGaN> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QZMjFC_RgY
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'd rather write letters to Princess Luna
<twilight_sprinkle> mlp isnt really That good story and character-wise
<Vivix> I like it- because- everyone have traits that they might need to improve, but might not be able to
<Chrysalis> Vivix but no one likes trixie as much as Meanwhile
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dear Princess Luna, HAI :D Your faithful follower, SB
<Vivix> Hehe
<twilight_sprinkle> but the characters are pretty good in terms of relatibility, if thats a word
<Vivix> yeah-
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dear SB, Ohai :3 Your faithful princess, Luna
<twilight_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: ALL HAIRU ZE SONAR REPABRIK!
<Vivix> I like the stories, because they feel like a story rather than a presinium sketch like many cartoons
<NocturnalBlade> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkhCNx-8Qos
<Metronome> ^^
<Vivix> but I am- that cartoon fan, I don't like anime, I don't like sketches-
<Chrysalis> who here would chooose celestia over luna?
<Bronysith> i dont understand what people have against clop or r34 in general i mean, some of the greatest art in history is R34, nude statues, paintings of nude people etc, its not like it is pedophilia or necrophilia, not having sex with children or dead bodies, in fact some of the art looks really good
<Vivix> well- dependso n the sketch
<CCCP> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu1UiaENGBg
<Vivix> remember that porn and nude art is two different things
<otakon> yes
<twilight_sprinkle> Vivix: yeah most little kids cartoons are pretty bland
<LoGaNs> it said my nick was in use
<StinkomanFan> "Dear Princess Celestia, today my father taught me the magic of shaving... it hurts like a bitch and I'm going to have to end up doing it for the rest of my life."
<otakon> but still nudity is a no-no
<Bronysith> CCCP: WHY YOU LISTEN TO EMO MUSIC?!
<LoGaNs> umm
<DJ_POn-3> im back check this out everypony :) http://pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/when-you-are-crossing-the-street-and-someone-honks-at-you-to-hurry-up.gif
<Vivix> I have noothing against clop, nooooooothing, but I never try to- justify it? It's not worth arguing about
<CCCP> Bronysith i actually like all music :3
<Canadian_Brony> StinkomanFan don't worry. After 3 or 4 you get used to it and don't get nicked as often.
<Canadian_Brony> if at all
<otakon> Bronysith: nudity is different from R34, which is LITERALLY pornography of character that were NEVER meant to be in pornography.
<LoGaNs> i think i know but he would hate me if i said why Bronysith
<Bronysith> CCCP: but my chemical romance is pure emo music, no wonder you think the way you do
<CrimsonPhoenix> guys
<LoGaNs> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QZMjFC_RgY
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm a clopper
*CrimsonPhoenix quickly hides behind something
<NocturnalBlade> *gasp*
*Bronysith slowly claps
<CCCP> Bronysith i still liek them and dont care what other people think :3
<DJ_POn-3> clopper :P
<Vivix> Many of us are, but there's no realy reason to bring it up in a pg chat, or try to turn people into accepting it when they should just tolerate it
<Bronysith> CCCP: they put messages into your mind, make you want to feel bad
<Applejack2012> I'm a clopper too
<CrimsonPhoenix> exactly Vivix
<CrimsonPhoenix> I for one
<Buytoast> Well now LoGaNs, you see, that's an example of a compeltely shitty in all aspects remix
<CrimsonPhoenix> am a person of many weird fetish
<CCCP> Bronysith -_- then how come i feel happy when im listening to them?
<LoGaNs> Buytoast: aww depression
<Buytoast> oh, are we talking about our fetishes now?
<CrimsonPhoenix> and MLP is just one thing from the many stuff that....well turn me on
<Buytoast> get comfy, this is gonna take a while
<NocturnalBlade> and this conversation stops now XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh boy
<Vivix> With how feral furries are becoming more normal, that's not really a weird thing
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol agreed NocturnalBlade
<CrimsonPhoenix> yeah we should stop before it gets out of hands
<Vivix> especially after Pokemon, feral porn --became more abundant
<Metronome> Chat talks about fetish ಠ_ಠ
<Vivix> <,<
<Buytoast> i'm not too surprised
<Buytoast> it was only a matter of time
<NocturnalBlade> -_- i think it already has CrimsonPhoenix
<Vivix> I love the psychology side that studies this, you know- but it's not really fit to discuss here
<Canadian_Brony> I have no opinion on this topc.
<CCCP> Bronysith also i dont think youve ever listened to one of their songs, its like in the 50's when older people thought that rock and roll made theire kids go crazy
<Canadian_Brony> Can we please move on?
<CrimsonPhoenix> just remember though, while you don't enjoy looking at an R34 pic, there's nothing really wrong to it and there's nothing really bad for one to use it for personal pleasure
<CCCP> and 60's
<CrimsonPhoenix> I am done with that
<Vivix> I thouht MCR was emo bull, but then I listened to it and enjoyed it imensly
<CCCP> it never ends
<Bronysith> CCCP: THE GENRE IS LITTERALLY EMO
<JRP> SuperBrony64: preety plz
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Please limit the R34 and Porn talk please :)
<DJ_POn-3> MCR ROX :D
<Canadian_Brony> thank you
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: yes aniki
<AJIsAwesome> SuperBrony64: Thank you.
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64, I am being carefull don't worry
<Buytoast> make a channel for em
<NocturnalBlade> I like MCR, just a couple songs though
<Vivix> Bronysith, the genre emo is not really MCR, man. Emo is like.. Death cab for cutie, and is beautiful
<otakon> ^
<CCCP> Bronysith it is? Is that supposed to make me hate them?
<Bronysith> CCCP: never said to make you hate them. BUT THEY ARE GENRED AS EMO
<Canadian_Brony> have some Whose Line http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4uUsZD-GOQ
<Vivix> Emo is a fairly clean 90s genre, MCR is more--pop punk with elements of emo, and a lot of their stuff is really really good
<CCCP> Bronysith but why do i care?
<Vivix> now if you want SAD deppo music, listen to Codeine or LOW, sadcore is amazing
<CCCP> i like music that sounds good dont care if fucking adolf hitler made it
<Bronysith> if someone wants to see a cute pic, please pm me
<Canadian_Brony> brb, I have chores to do.
<Vivix> CCCP Totally
<Bronysith> it isnt r34, but GODDAMN SUGGESTIVE
<CCCP> well i would still think its fucking creepy if he made it but still
<Vivix> Like Burzum
<Vivix> I can't listen to that without shuddering
<Vivix> Neo nazi murdere who tried to blow up a church
<Bronysith> i like Final Fantasy OSTs
<Vivix> ofcourse, the music is pretty bad, so I don't have to listen to it
<DJ_POn-3> this is for all the mlp fim lovers http://www.pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/when-you-hear-the-intro-of-your-favorite-tv-show.gif

<Applejack2012> yay!§

<Bronysith> otakon: "I wonder why my child got raped by that ugly old guy"
<Bronysith> otakon: if that child gets raped i will not be surprised if the parent says this
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> thats just not right :|
<otakon> well none the less I hope that doesn't happen
<otakon> what Sketch_Toku_Brony said

<CCCP> Hi TheLivingTombstone!
<Bronysith> TheLivingTombstone: you the real thing?
<Shizuka> 13This is not the place for this kind of discussion.
<NocturnalBlade> well the conversations we have here would probably be the reason XD
<TheLivingTombstone> Bronysith: Yes.
<Shizuka> 13Take it elsewhere.

<TheLivingTombstone> Buytoast: How do I make my crap delicous? I try adding some sugar.
<JRP> seems legit
<Rex_Mundi> Oh, Dead island. Isnt this that game that, when the trailer hit, everyone thought it was going to be this powerful story with characters you care about, but then it diddnt turn out to be that at all.

<TheLivingTombstone> I appreciate your opinion though!

<Buytoast> i didn't ask what others thought though
<Rex_Mundi> Did anypony see the interview with Andrew WK on Conan? the one that involved him talking about pinkiepie?
<Barbetos> l4d sounds... different from what I remember
<Buytoast> would you answer instead of redirecting?
<NocturnalBlade> DJ_POn-3: comsume the rainbow, throw up the rainbow
<Vivix|Awai> Rex_Mundi, I'm gonna try to catch it when it airs here, used to be a big Conan fan

<Pearly> hey there AJIsAwesome
<Buytoast> I'm asking WHY you did, not what MY opinions mean to you.
<CCCP> Bronysith they could of used other IRC chats before
<Vivix|Awai> I don't think it's real either, but that is no proof
<Buytoast> if you can't answer just admit you can't answer.
<TheLivingTombstone> Because I wanted to, Buytoast.
<Pearly> hey there Vladmir
<Buytoast> there you go

<JRP> SuperBrony64: ban?
<DJ_POn-3> http://pleated-jeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/when-you-finally-think-life-is-going-great.gif

<CCCP> hai otakon ^-^
<AJIsAwesome> JRP: We don't know if this the real TheLivingTombstone.
<Vivix|Awai> Buytoast, the question is unanswerable, because the motivation is..unrelated to the result
<Ponies47> CCCP: Then when the mods came back they return the favor
<otakon> probably that guy that was imitating TLT
<DJ_POn-3> CCCP why :'(
<Barbetos> I don't think you would be a mod for long CCCP
<Ponies47> Ohai AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Hello!

<CCCP> Bronysith you could of just said when pigs fly so i could think of a come back...
<Bronysith> Rex_Mundi: try communists
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Welcome back!
<Canadian_Brony> pfft, Communism
<otakon> bugger all flash crashed on me
<otakon> I blame Firefox 15 update
<Vivix|Awai> They are republic though, aren't they? Socialist or not
<CCCP> Communism 4th best thing on earth
<otakon> either that or Ant Video Downloader
<Bronysith> otakon: why not the tonberries i set into your net?
<otakon> Bronysith: bc those things creep me out!
<CCCP> Marxism 3rd best waaaay better than communism
<Rex_Mundi> Communism doesnt imply non-democracy. Republic doesnt have to = democracy.
<Biglaw> CCCP Then bacon at third, maple syrup at second, and Ponies at #1
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> huh same thing happened to me not long ago
<Vivix|Awai> Socialism is beautiful
<CCCP> Biglaw lol
<Buytoast> Is someone dissing democracy?
<WindWhistler> I thought politics weren't allowed
<Buytoast> becuase when you diss democracy...
<otakon> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Flash crash after Firefox 15 update?
<CCCP> any way hi! Biglaw *glomps*
<Viper> CCCP : Socialism
<Buytoast> YOU DISS MURIKA
<Vivix|Awai> Socialism is democratic

*Biglaw huggles CCCP back
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> otakon yep but its working fine now
<Canadian_Brony> pfft, 'Merica
<CCCP> Viper socialism is overrated

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Viper> CCCP : Its a good idea
<otakon> WindWhistler: it's still a Republic
<Vivix|Awai> We're part socialist, but not enough, dentist still too expensive for many
<Rex_Mundi> All republics are somewhere on a scale of Oligarchy on one side, and true Democracy on the other. Its a sliding scale.
<otakon> still we're getting off that point
<WindWhistler> otakon: a DEMOCRATIC republic.
<otakon> OKAY NVM!
<Viper> Ireland is a Republic
<WindWhistler> well whatever
<otakon> ENOUGH!
<WindWhistler> Back to RiffTrax

*WindWhistler holds back an otakon shipping
<TheLivingTombstone> Its okay CCCP.
<Panda|Chimera> :kickcount otakon
<otakon> goddammit
<Rex_Mundi> Cuba is a more oligarchic republic, but USA isnt a true Democracy either.
<WindWhistler> otakon: Nope. I'm watching somewhere else
<Buytoast> I ain't sorry
<CCCP> why is everypony so angry right now? :C
<Kandarihu> Rex_Mundi, communism only takes the form of all the power falling to a small oligarchy. It only carries the banner of democracy but it never stays like that.
<Panda|Chimera> otakon you missed it last night, I did a you!
<Buytoast> you can say it all you want

<Biglaw> see ya TheLivingTombstone!
<Vivix|Awai> Very few people acknowledged him Buytoast
<Vivix|Awai> like..4 guys?
<WindWhistler> and I'm guessing no one recognized what I was talking about?
<Vivix|Awai> wait- more, but wahtever

<CCCP> Bronysith it doesnt last long for fat people
*NocturnalBlade revives CCCP with phoenix down

<Marx> So add 3 more rounds to the 90+ rounds I have to win to get all the TMs.
<AJIsAwesome> Not everyone likes the same things. That's a natural fact of life, but you should never insult someone who likes what they like.
<VladmirMakarov> i mean these days they're even stupider than normal
<CCCP> Bronysith it should have been a wild thornberry
<Marx> And other crap I'm rambling on about.
<BronyInstrumental> for once, i actually agree with Buytoast. just because someone is good at something doesn't mean you should act towards them any different than you do others
<Bronysith> CCCP: you obviously have no idea what a tonberry is you prick
<CCCP> VladmirMakarov eh not really
<Bronysith> CCCP: that was in no way clever
<Bronysith> CCCP: just showed your ignorance

<BaconMane> 0,5ew
<Canadian_Brony> some female bronies prefer brony, some pegasister, and I've seen them go either way. It's a matter of opinion.
<Rex_Mundi> I like the term pegasister, to me, its just a nickname for female bronies, so i dont get the hate torwards it.
<CCCP> BaconMane what is it?
<RaveBrony> Canadian_Brony: True
<AJIsAwesome> BaconMane: What is it, BaconMane?
<Canadian_Brony> hi BaconMane. There was something I was going to ask you, but I can't remember now . . .

<BaconMane> 0,5Bile as in, like, stomach

<NocturnalBlade> RaveBrony: so true lol
<Kandarihu> The word pegasister, I can't put my finger on the problem with that term. Maybe I will later on.

<Canadian_Brony> in your opinion, that is
<CCCP> DashWithRainbows it was alright not much happend thank you for asking :)
<Ihop> if they dont agree with mine that to is an oppinon
<Rex_Mundi> To me, 'Brony' is 'Brother pony' rather than 'Bro pony', because who wants to be assossiated with "bros"? And dont even start to sugggest "/b/ronies".
<BileGraze> :o
<otakon> No opinion is inherently wrong unless it is based off of wrong information
<BileGraze> Yay.

<RainbowDash90> :D :P :(
<Buytoast> ponies still shit up the board everyday
<AJIsAwesome> There are many different theories on where the term "brony" came from. I honestly couldn't are which theory it is, so I'm going with "Brother pony".
<CCCP> i like /wsg/
<AJIsAwesome> *care*
<Rex_Mundi> Buytoast: So does furry porn and gifs of annimals getting thrown off bridges
<IMIGalil_Nyan> The term brony was coined by a fan on /co/ before the fandom even left 4chan.

<otakon> BaconMane: it's in bad taste
<AJIsAwesome> :kickcount otakon
<Canadian_Brony> BaconMane he didn't say it. He typed it. If he said it, you would never hear him.
<CCCP> honestly /b/ was never good nor was it funny at all, in fact basically any one who went on there back in 2005 doesnt go on anymore so who gives a shit?
<BileGraze> JRP said a bad word. O:
<BaconMane> 0,5yes i would
<BaconMane> 0,5I have

<Buytoast> it's true, /b/ is shit these days
<Kandarihu> BaconMane, Hell is the name of a terrible place.
<Canadian_Brony> I don't know why I find that funny
<IMIGalil_Nyan> Everyone likes kicking otakon. Especially when he's down.
<Canadian_Brony> but I do
<otakon> it's also a place in Sweden IIRC
<BaconMane> 0,5RainbowDash90 watch yourself

<BileGraze> Okay, back again.
<BaconMane> 0,5your point isnt very pointy
<Buytoast> permaban him
<BronyInstrumental> RainbowDash90: if you're gonna rant at the mods, at least spell things right, and use punctuation!
<Buytoast> he's ignoring direct orders
<otakon> it's actually Alma's music box theme
<RaveBrony> you wont win against mods. Youll be gone long before you can make a point :D
<Ihop> #bordem
<RainbowDash90> dont start
<JRP> ...
<JRP> advertising
<Canadian_Brony> you spelled it wrong Ihop
<Buytoast> he's talking back
<Ihop> quiert
<BileGraze> Can the play, Shuzuki, or whatever his/her name is, type?
<Canadian_Brony> it's "boredom"
<Rex_Mundi> Chat derped on me
<CCCP> the only good thing that ever happend to /b/ was the justin beiber to Norht Korea prank and /fur/day massacre and of course the tome green prank
<BileGraze> player*
<CCCP> yom*
<CCCP> tom*
<otakon> can we please stop talking about 4chan?
<otakon> also lol
<Ihop> no
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP- how was the /fur/ day masacre good?
<otakon> I wish Chuck Norris was here
<Canadian_Brony> Chuck Norris doesn't simply "come here"
<CCCP> otakon awww but i like 4chan
<otakon> no one does
<otakon> lol
<BaconMane> 0,5Chuck Norris jokes are stupid
<Canadian_Brony> pfft, 4chan
<Buytoast> 4chan aint that bad
<otakon> Buytoast: it is the Mos Eisley of the interent
<otakon> internet*
<RaveBrony> Im never going bad to 4chan, the things i saw cannot be unseen...
<RaveBrony> *back
<Buytoast> i mean "Oh man, 4chan! Obviously it's all CP and stuff that I've heard it contains!"
<IMIGalil_Nyan> BaconMane jokes are stupid :I
<otakon> It's the most wretched hive of scum and villainy you'll ever find.
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi okay sorry i personally thought it was funny, but thats just me, im alright with furries but honestly couldnt they have their oen site?
<Buytoast> not really
<RaveBrony> otakon: I agree
<AJIsAwesome> I'm indifferent about the Chuck Norris jokes.
<Buytoast> there are far worse places
<RainbowDash90> 4chan sucks thats all i have to say about it
<otakon> BaconMane: IMIGalil_Nyan is RX-78
<Kandarihu> I generally stay away from the bad parts of 4chan. The only go to /c/ and /g/ for the most part, and I watch my step on /f/
<Dovah> BaconMane: correct one of the rules of the interntes says "if you make chuck norris jokes you are a newfag, no exeptions" (im not kidding)
*BaconMane 0,5has never been on 4chan :D
<CCCP> do itt!
<Canadian_Brony> BaconMane agreed. He's a washed-up has-been who receives to much praise. I'm surprised to hear Chuck Norris stuff around my school still. Just kicking a dead horse.
<otakon> Buytoast: yeah but at least those places TELL you they are far worse and for that express purpose of being far wors
<CCCP> now
<RainbowDash90> its not worth going on Bacon
<BaconMane> 0,5Naaw
<RaveBrony> Im so lost with these "/?/" things :D
<Canadian_Brony> no pun intended
<BileGraze> Has anyone here ever bought a Rainbow Dash plushie? And I don't mean the really crappy ones that look like crap. I'm talking about a perfectly made plushie that resembles RD in every way. Sadly the high priced ones.
<BaconMane> 0,5RaveBrony best to not get involved with what theyre talking about
<otakon> enope
<Buytoast> deviantart is worse than 4chan and it doesn't wran you
<twilight_sprinkle> RaveBrony: sections on 4chan
<CCCP> RaveBrony /be/
<otakon> I like the show but I don't buy merch
<otakon> brb
<AJIsAwesome> BileGraze: No. But I know people who have.:D
<Canadian_Brony> BileGraze I've seen alot, but either they were too damn expensive or not for sale.
<RaveBrony> BaconMane: I shall not then :D
<BaconMane> 0,5I hear 4chan isnt good so i avoid it as best i can
<BileGraze> If only they wearn't so overpriced...
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP- all the /fur/ day masacre do is ensure that the only kind of furry art that gets put on 4chan is of the erotic kind, and everyday huge threads of it pop up and grow large before it gets deleated. Its why the 4chan term "furry fryday" exists.
<RaveBrony> otakon: mlp merch?
<Kandarihu> /c/=Cute (generally G rated stuff) /g/=Technology /f/=Flash
<RainbowDash90> smart thinking bacomnmane
<BaconMane> 0,5Fryday?
<BronyInstrumental> Rex_Mundi: what's the /fur/ day massacre?
<Rex_Mundi> *friday
<BileGraze> But, why can't Hasbro just make a Rainbow Dash Plushie. IT would probaly look just like the really high priced ones.
<Ihop> i get my porn from 4chan
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Buytoast> it's a good place to go
<BileGraze> And only be like $20.
<CCCP> Rex_Mund honestly i didnt know furries liked anthromorphic creatures for any other reason than sexual ones, but thats just me being ignorant
<Rex_Mundi> BronyInstrumental: They gave the furries their own bord, just to deleate it and ban everyone who posted in it.
<Buytoast> beautiful
<RaveBrony> BileGraze: The recent ones ive seen in Walmart are decent considering theyre only lik $12
<Kandarihu> CCCP, not all furries. The term applies to people who aren't even perverts.
<Canadian_Brony> BileGraze the main problem with RD plushies is she's the most detailed from the Mane 6. Her mane and tail are 12 unique pieces altogether, and then there's her wings to consider.
<BileGraze> D:
<CCCP> come on it was still funny!
<BronyInstrumental> Rex_Mundi: okay. i won't join the 'furry' debate because my IRL best friend is a furry, and he's pretty important to me, so i try my best not to argue about it anywhere
<BileGraze> I could donate. :)
<Bronysith> CCCP: no it was not
<RaveBrony> BronyInstrumental: Same here! (\
<BileGraze> So they have enough money to afford all da stuffing and stuff.
<CCCP> Kandarihu i didnt know
<Canadian_Brony> BileGraze I've seen a Gala RD plushie that went for over $2750. It was really detailed, though.
<RaveBrony> I dont mind furries, the ones ive met are Very nice people.
<BronyInstrumental> RaveBrony: /) we seem to have a lot in common >.>
<Canadian_Brony> I'll try to find it for you
<BileGraze> Are you kidding me?...
<Canadian_Brony> no
<Canadian_Brony> I'll find it
<BileGraze> $2750...
<BaconMane> 0,5Who the fuck
<BaconMane> 0,5would pay that much for a plushie
<RaveBrony> BronyInstrumental: :D
<CCCP> Bronysith i found it funny, not because that it happend to furries but just because that it was a successful prank
<Buytoast> a brony BaconMane
<AJIsAwesome> BaconMane: We would.:D
<Kandarihu> RaveBrony, you're basing your opinions on personal experience. That's good.
<Bronysith> http://yayacosplay.deviantart.com/art/Jessica-Rabbit-costume-preview-324093997?q=boost%3Apopular%20meta%3Aall%20max_age%3A8h&qo=2 jessica rabbit cosplay <3
<Canadian_Brony> BaconMane take a look at ot http://www.tomopop.com/this-is-a-2-275-handmade-rainbow-dash-plush-22369.phtml
<otakon> nearly 3K for a plushie?
<otakon> really?
<Buytoast> 3k for a doll
<BronyInstrumental> BaconMane: britannia was auctioned off at BUCK for £1000, a lot of cash but nowhere near $2750 so i don't know :D
<Buytoast> so pathetic
<RaveBrony> Kandarihu: :$
<BronyInstrumental> $2275*
<RaveBrony> ^
<AJIsAwesome> BronyInstrumental: Don't get me wrong, but why are you bringing this up again? You know where this got us last time.
*CCCP once went to a store saw rainbowdash toy wanted to buy it, but had no money :'(
<RaveBrony> Aw D:
<Buytoast> ah, 2k
*CCCP pussied out
<Bronysith> ugh
<CrimsonPhoenix> They are all fuzzed about that when it's normal?
<Buytoast> that's barely more reasonable
<BronyInstrumental> AJIsAwesome: bringing what up?
<BaconMane> 0,5Yeah, uh.... that's not worth $2000 +
<Canadian_Brony> CCCP when I did see one, she was a brushable, which makes her look G3.
<Bronysith> CCCP: you dont need to say that in RP form, just say you pussied out, not in /me format
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Don't get me wrong, but why are you bringing this up again? You know where this got us last time.
<RaveBrony> I buy my pony merch with pride :D
<BaconMane> 0,5Even if it's physically worth that much, it's not mentally worth it
<AJIsAwesome> BronyInstrumental: Tab fail.
<Canadian_Brony> bidding war?
<RaveBrony> BaconMane: But it was for Charity D:
<BronyInstrumental> AJIsAwesome: dammit! misping
<BaconMane> 0,5I wonder what idiot spent that much on a plush toy.
<CCCP> Bronysith did that change the course of human existance? I think not
<Canadian_Brony> dunno, but he must've been rich
<Buytoast> probably some neckbeard in his mom's house surrounded by his other plushies
<CrimsonPhoenix> I think BaconMane is my number 1 favorite mod
<AJIsAwesome> BaconMane: Well, it WAS made with a great amount of detail.
<BaconMane> 0,5Crimson: I dont screw around :3
<BaconMane> 0,5AJ: Yeah, so?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Noooooooooooooooo totally nooooot
<BileGraze> Do I really need to pay $100-$1000+ just to have something to snuggle up with when I go to sleep?
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> ^^
<Buytoast> you can easily pay 50 ish for a cheap whore maybe
<BaconMane> 0,5That's $2000 that could have been spent on like, food, or clothes, or payments. Or stashed for savings.
<RaveBrony> Lol!!
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle hiya!
<BaconMane> 0,5Buytoast has the right idea
<Barbetos> Anyone here up for some advanced MvM?
<otakon> BaconMane: well maybe they have disposable income
*twilight_sprinkle hus CCCP :)
<Canadian_Brony> I don't want a cheap one, but I don't want to go into a $500 investment to buy it either.
<BaconMane> 0,5You know how many hookers I can hire wi- wait...
*twilight_sprinkle *hugs CCCP :D
*CCCP hus twilight_sprinkle
<BronyInstrumental> BaconMane: ikr? i'm strapped for cash for musical equipment and people spend 3k on plushies :S
<twilight_sprinkle> CCCP: Xd
<CCCP> twilight_sprinkle haha
<Buytoast> hey, as far as I know, it's not illegal if ya don't pork em
<Canadian_Brony> I'm saving up to buy a gaming computer.
<RaveBrony> If i had the money id buy a damn accordion.... Such a fun looking instrument :D
<BronyInstrumental> pork em?
<Rex_Mundi> CCCP- read this.http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryFandom Furries are simply art nerds. Im somewhat of one (albiet a mild one) but there are indeed some really weird people in the fandom. But also a lot of awesome people. There is porn, but thats not a bad thing and there are plenty of furries who dont like that stuff.
<BaconMane> 0,5Idk, -$3000.... +1 small plushie
<CrimsonPhoenix> Canadian_Brony, inb4 Alienware Laptop
<Canadian_Brony> er, lemme rephrase that
<Buytoast> end of game
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, you mean like Bronies?
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi okay :P
<Canadian_Brony> I'm going to upgrade my old computer so A) it works and B) it works well.
<Canadian_Brony> I don't want laptop
<Canadian_Brony> I want a desktop
<BaconMane> 0,5That reminds me of the time I was playing Skyrim and I bought an enchanted mace for S9000+ and never used it.
<RaveBrony> :o
<Buytoast> goddamn francis
<CrimsonPhoenix> though be aware that I didn't meant Bronies are furries
<Rex_Mundi> CrimsonPhoenix: Bronies are alot like Furries. Many Furries are bronies themselves.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yeah
<BaconMane> 0,5Rex you're wrong
<BileGraze> Soo...I heard there's gonna be a MLP commic somewhere in November.:$
<Bronysith> point?
<BileGraze> I'm excited. :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> BaconMane, please explain
<Bronysith> BileGraze: have fun with that
<BaconMane> 0,5Im too lazy to explain in detail
<BaconMane> 0,5Furries like furry things
<BaconMane> 0,5bronies like MLP
<Rex_Mundi> BaconMane: A lot of fandoms are similar really
<RaveBrony> I think "Cloppers" are like furries. O.o
<BileGraze> Let's not mention those people.
<BaconMane> 0,5I think cloppers is a really bad term. :/
<CrimsonPhoenix> BaconMane, that's different how?
<Buytoast> depends on what they're spanking the plank to
<Canadian_Brony> BaconMane you can just let Silverscreen explain furries.
<Rex_Mundi> Ponies are anthropomorphic animals. Furries like anthropomorphic animals. bronies like ponies.
<RaveBrony> BaconMane: What term do you want me to use without being very blunt? lol
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix as Silverscreen when you see him.
<RaveBrony> :D
<Canadian_Brony> *ask
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rex_Mundi, now you're wrong
<CCCP> Rex_Mundi i skimmed threw it a bit and its a cool fandom i guess just honestly i dont really like anthromprphic things
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ponies are quite feral
<BaconMane> 0,5I don't mind NSFW at all, but I don't "clop" nor am I "clopper."
<RaveBrony> Oh O.o
<BronyInstrumental> BaconMane: i share that view
<CrimsonPhoenix> anthropomorphic are animals with human shape and traits
<Colt_Discord> hey
<Buytoast> it's better to just not join any fandom, because the assholes of it will always ruin you
<RaveBrony> I dislike looking at ponies in a pervert view
<CrimsonPhoenix> or humans with animal traits and fur
<Ihop> i cloped once man those cobblestones had it comin
<CCCP> is society so stupic that we name ourselves off of the porn people watch?
<Shizuka> 13still not sure if anyone is paying attention
<BaconMane> 0,5I don't identify myself as a brony anymore
<BronyInstrumental> Buytoast: remind me again, why are you even here? you hate everything, so why come to a place full of love?
<Barbetos> So. Any advanced MvM?
<Canadian_Brony> I have no opinion on this topic.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Are we seriously on the topic of porn .-.
<RaveBrony> Ihop: Oh god, hahaha :D
<Shizuka> 13I thought we said to stop with the porn discussion.
<Rex_Mundi> Anthropomorphism is simply humanlike characteristsics given to non-human characters. MLP ponies have personalities and can talk, thus, anthropomorphic
<CrimsonPhoenix> SuperBrony64, no porn
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ooh. I have I Hate Mountains.
<Buytoast> This palce aint full of love
<otakon> GUYS!
<ShadowQuill> Season 3: Sept. 17

<BileGraze> Okay, fuck this room. Fuck it. I'm not gonna look at fucking porn comments. Fuck this. I'ma go to a different room for a bit.
<otakon> ShadowQuill: do not even hit at it
<ShadowQuill> otakon: I will not
<BronyInstrumental> Buytoast: don't question my question, just answer it
<BaconMane> 0,5Just because people see brony as such a bad thing I'm not going to bother with assholes and not identify myself as a brony

<ShadowQuill> SuperBrony64: Wasn't gonna spoil it, just telling them what things have been found and the date of the season release
<Eulshy> whats going on?
<Rex_Mundi> BaconMane: Wait, who sees bronies as a bad thing?
<BronyInstrumental> Buytoast: and so if you hate everything, how is a bunch of "bronies" talking entertaining to you?
<RaveBrony> Yay!
<CCCP> i dont think i should adentify brony as a persnoaitly trait but i must admit that honestly i am a brony
<otakon> oh no

<Barbetos> Source does shadows really well

<ShadowQuill> He's not here, is she?
<CCCP> chats crazy today
<Shizuka> 13I am getting sick and tired of people being disrespectful to each other and streamers and carrying on conversations we specifically say to stop.
<RaveBrony> So am i
<RaveBrony> :(
<otakon> ShadowQuill: she's streaming mate.
<ShadowQuill> Why are people mean today?
<Canadian_Brony> ShadowQuill S3 does not yet have a release date. If it did, Tom might say somthing besides "Season 3 does not yet have a release date."
<Barbetos> I didn't do it!
*CCCP hugs RaveBrony
<Canadian_Brony> or somethin' like that
*RaveBrony hugs CCCP

<pony_4050> "Elven ropes. We sell them all over Middle-Earth to all those suicidal guys who want to be sure."
<Rex_Mundi> So is Equestria somewhere around Rivendell?
<Canadian_Brony> not sure
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: One can only hope......
<Freefall29> god this buffer
<Canadian_Brony> I don't have a map of all mythical lands
<Meanwhile> Everyday ahm bufferin'
<otakon> safe as a sixpack in a AA meeting
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'm kind of sad Luigi's Mansion 2 got delayed
<otakon> Meanwhile: so...does that mean it's not just me?
<Canadian_Brony> that doesn't sound safe
<Canadian_Brony> otakon nnope
*Spectrum_Rush One Buffering to Rule Them All
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: don't be, that means it'll be better when it does come out
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Those were beta ghosts right?
<Rex_Mundi> I have to leave everypony, maybe see you later!
<Canadian_Brony> Spectrum_Rush buffeRING
<Canadian_Brony> LoLz
<AJIsAwesome> Rex_Mundi: Bye!
<Canadian_Brony> seeya Rex_Mundi
<mineroo> whats happening
<thelonepony> byw Rex_Mundi
<Meanwhile> otakon: Every now and then there're pockets of buffer, but it sounds like you've got it worse.
<Freefall29> otakon: yeah, but if it gets delayed and the game sucks, the delay will not be helping the game out.
<otakon> http://scranton.mylittlefacewhen.com/media/f/img/mlfw7692-1343905071857621.gif buffer disappoints the ponies
<Canadian_Brony> Hi mineroo. Fellowship of the Ring + Rifftrax
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Take Duke Nukem forever for example
<Bronysith> otakon: yes it does
<VenHur> Luigi's Mansion 2 was delayed? FFFFFFffff-
<AJIsAwesome> mineroo: Hello!
<Canadian_Brony> VenHur GODDAMIT
<mineroo> is this abriged?
<Animorph11> Hello ^^
<Ryunosuke> oh
<thelonepony> hai mineroo
<AJIsAwesome> mineroo: Rifftrax
<Canadian_Brony> that's a game I'm looking forward to
<Freefall29> SpadeMagnes[R]: perfect example. 12 years and it was everything that's wrong with modern gaming all wraped into one
<Cypresswolf> mineroo: this is the theatrical version
<AJIsAwesome> Can't waitt until Pikmin 3 comes out.
<AJIsAwesome> *wait*
<Animorph11> I agree
<Freefall29> can't wait till doom 4 comes out
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Sadly Pikmin 3 isnt a launch title
<StinkomanFan> Fun fact: if you replace every instance of "elves", "elvish", and "elf" with Elvis it becomes funnier
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Which is stupid
<Canadian_Brony> I want to play ZombiU
<mineroo> i have the game
<otakon> the strength of mane failed
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: Couldn't agree more.
<Buytoast> wait wait wait
<otakon> No
<Cypresswolf> :| Noo!
<Buytoast> Pikmin 3 isn't a launch title?
<Meanwhile> And yet again, Elrond could've just shivved him and thrown him into the lava, ring and all.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I mean Pikmin 1 was a GC launch title
<AJIsAwesome> I remember NC doing a parody of this.
<otakon> why didn't he JUST TAKE THE RING!
<Meanwhile> But nooooo.
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: IKR?
<Canadian_Brony> otakon dumbass
<otakon> Seriously, Elrond was a badass Elvis
<otakon> he could have taken it and thrown it in himself
<otakon> there, done deal
<Bronysith> azul, wat r u doin? azul, STAHP
<otakon> Mead for all
<SpadeMagnes[R]> But we have to have plot!
<Animorph11> wow lol to this
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: The power to resist the ring varies between each person.
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: well in the BOOKS that never happened
<Freefall29> is it just me or does it keep jump cutting?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> We cant have logic in things it would make it too easy!
<RainbowDash90> 030
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: and yet Elrond didn't even TRY to take it, which means zero hold on him I think
<mineroo> whares pinkes forth wall
<Canadian_Brony> perhaps he couldn't bring it to himself to kill someone he fought alongside in a great war
<otakon> mineroo: not on atm
<Freefall29> man, I paid 200 rupees for that thing. broke just like that
<Cypresswolf> :| You dun goofed, Boromir
<Bronysith> Freefall29: lol
<StinkomanFan> NO SHIT SHERLOCK
<Meanwhile> Staaaaaare.
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: True, but the ring corrupts everyone who touches it.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> You need 100 smithing to repair that
<AJIsAwesome> Freefall29: :D
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: let's see, fate of ALL the world for one more life OR the continuation of a great evil? ...I vote first.
<Bronysith> SpadeMagnes[R]: bad reference is bad
<Cypresswolf> :3 I know I do
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I'm at least happy we get a new paper mario game this fall
<otakon> finally
<otakon> only took a dog's age
<otakon> and he died
<Freefall29> SpadeMagnes[R]: and its not gonna be like super paper mario, but its gonna be hard to be the 1000 year door
<otakon> R.I.P. Old Yeller
<AJIsAwesome> SpadeMagnes[R]: True, but not to sound like a hardcore fanboy but I kind of miss the badges.
<mineroo> this part was in family guy
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I like hard games
<Canadian_Brony> otakon think of the person closest to you. Would you ever bring the will power to kill them?
<Cypresswolf> that background music
<SpadeMagnes[R]> But 1000 year door wasnt that hard for me
<Freefall29> sorry, I was trying to say beat.
<Freefall29> spelling fail
<AJIsAwesome> I love Paper Mario: TTYD. The only game that I find better than the original.
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: yeah, loved every minute of that game
<DoctorWhoovesV10> the music is making me fall asleep
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Paper mario 1 still has the biggest dick move ever
<Canadian_Brony> Thousand Year Door is awesme
<Canadian_Brony> SpadeMagnes[R] never played it. What was it?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> if you fail one of the quizes in the final dungeon you can fight 3 anti guys at once
<Ryunosuke> those 5 kisses
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: one, Elrond and Isildur were comrades in arms; not lovers. Two, it it was over destroyin the greatest evil in the world FOREVER then I think I would.
<AJIsAwesome> The only part I founf hard about TTYD was the final boss. But that's because I got 3 Poison Mushrooms on the roulette and she killed me.:|
<mineroo> is there a spitfire here?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> One anti guy is hard enough
<otakon> That was NOT one of them
<Cypresswolf> And then they...went they're seperates ways
<AJIsAwesome> *found*
<Meanwhile> Morrrdor
<otakon> mineroo: I don't think so

<Ryunosuke> I appologize
<Barbetos> Huh.
<flutter_spin> I so hated that table
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: bc they dropped the price bc the 3DS was kind of bombing at first
<Barbetos> That is missing atleast 100 elements.
<Cypresswolf> The .ic Table
<flutter_spin> Had to memorize it and take a test
<DrSteveSCARz> Uup...
<mineroo> ir iron
<RAWRity> So, some guy got up in Bill Nye's face about not believing in evolution. Nye told the guy to scientifically fuck himself.
<DrSteveSCARz> Krypton :P
<Barbetos> You silly humans and your periodic tables.
<flutter_spin> "Why are we taking a test over the table? It's right there. We can google it if we forget."
<Barbetos> I mean... er...

<HoodyNinja> I like Boromir
<Canadian_Brony> Belt Buckle to rule them all.
<Meanwhile> Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
<otakon> superretroworld: small town here, and no car in the middle of the goddamn country
<Midnight_Stormwing> i honestly rarely ever talk in this chat anymore...
<RAWRity> Brace Yourselves. Winter is Coming.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> He certainly wont betray anyone
<Flootahshy> Midnight_Stormwing: Why not?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> <_<
<Barbetos> Now run along scant, to Mordor!
<cowvarkian> certainly
<Reikim> I like the artwork for this.
<Canadian_Brony> Midnight_Stormwing you should. We have some rather . . . interesting conversations
<superretroworld> otakon: oh, sorry then :(
<cowvarkian> One cannot simply walk into mordor
*Barbetos walks into Mordor
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its like the movie Birds
<Barbetos> This is a silly place.
<Reikim> The install screen is quite lovely on its own.
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: One ring to rule. One ring to find them. One ring to track them down and in the darkness bind them. At least i think thats it
<Charlie_The_Bronco> i dont know why they didnt just fly on the eagles to mordor
<Midnight_Stormwing> Flootahshy: cause... well... i kinda got bored of this chat... and i have poor multitasking skills at best
*Barbetos walks out of Mordor
<RAWRity> Funfact: in a deleted scene from this, we see Boromir being instructed to steal the ring to save Gondor.
*HoodyNinja teleported into mordor
<SpadeMagnes[R]> One does not simply rock into mordor
<cowvarkian> Because that would've been boring, Charlie_The_Bronco
<Shizuka> 13one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
<Canadian_Brony> Charlie_The_Bronco because that wouldn't make a good story.
<Rex_Mundi> *go east, toss Ring into Ocean*
<Meanwhile> One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them. One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
<superretroworld> Charlie_The_Bronco: arrows
<Meanwhile> In the land of Mordor, where the shadows lie.
<HoodyNinja> thx Shizuka

<RaveBrony> $60?
<Shizuka> 13RAWRity: eeyup
<Reikim> s...sixty + dollars...
*Charlie_The_Bronco ponders like reptie
<Canadian_Brony> One does not simply bring down a mountain.
<HoodyNinja> I used to have a one ring
<flutter_spin> LOL
<Reikim> It's 59.99 without taxes taken into account.
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Fus ro dah?
<superretroworld> Charlie_The_Bronco: ppl can shoot arrows at the eagles
<Reikim> That places it between 60 and 70 dollars.
<otakon> One does not simply say "One does not simply"
<cowvarkian> one does not simply one does not simply
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Use the clear skies shout!
<Charlie_The_Bronco> one does not simply count to potatoe
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> but no montly fee so it's worth it i guess
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: he's a wizard, not a Dovahkhin
<HoodyNinja> One does not simply make fun of lord of the rings
<Canadian_Brony> okay, who played the Song of Storms?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Damn
<Dovah> otakon: dat ping
<cowvarkian> Canadian_Brony: you caught me
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: You mean Dragonborn?

<Meanwhile> No monthly fee and actually being worth playing is something not many MMOs manage.
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: yes Dovahkhin
<SpadeMagnes[R]> NO SHIT
<AJIsAwesome> Okay, who scared Fluttershy?
<Dovah> otakon: also its Dovahkiin.
<Charlie_The_Bronco> im a canadian brony as well....what does that make at this poin t? like 5 of us?
<StinkomanFan> ONE MOVIE TO RULE THEM ALL, ONE MOVIE TO FIND THEM, ONE MOVIE TO BRING THEM ALL AND ONE MOVIE IN THE DARKNESS TO BIND THEM
<cowvarkian> Charlie_The_Bronco: maybe 7
<Meanwhile> Usually no correlation there, but it's a general occurence.
<cowvarkian> pure nuget indeed
<Canadian_Brony> "Up the mountain" which was obviously being hit with lightning
<Charlie_The_Bronco> we can have a bronycon at a dennys in yahk

<Canadian_Brony> compred to crap I've seen
<Canadian_Brony> *compared
<Shizuka> 13(that's about as far as i got... LOTR is bloody DENSE)
<Meanwhile> I played for 5 years.
<Rex_Mundi> Shizuka: Yeah, back in Bagend
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: *Looks at Birdemic*
<Cypresswolf> Sounds like a marriage pep talk :P
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: I read them when I was 11
<Reikim> That's a lot.
<HoodyNinja> I read the first two books, never finished the third, don't even remember a word of any of it
<tSparx> Shizuka: Bro, there wasn't even dialogue for like 30 pages. LOTR IS BLOOD DENSE
<Pearly> :D yay Rex_Mundi
<Barbetos> Gandalf really has the creepy old man whistle going on
<Shizuka> 13they must not have invented paragraphs in tolkien's time
<Barbetos> listen close
<Canadian_Brony> I have never read a single LoTR book.
<Meanwhile> I learned in The Burning Crusade, I refined through Wrath of the Lich King, and I ruled Cataclysm.
<cachi01|phone> HoodyNinja i t
<RAWRity> Shizuka: never try reading the Silmarillion. It makes LOTR look like See Spot Run
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Could you use it as a paper weight?
<Cypresswolf> When in doubt, Go Left
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: what are these paragraphs you speak of
<Shizuka> 13i think i checked out silmarillion once
<HoodyNinja> cachi01|phone: a n
<cowvarkian> I own that
<cachi01|phone> HoodyNinja i thought there were 6 books
<RAWRity> Shizuka: ONCE
<Rex_Mundi> Shizuka: You should read the "council of Elrond" chapter...
<Shizuka> 13i promptly turned around and returned it
<Reikim> That sounds way more badass than it should.
<BaconMane> 0,5Behold, Doralius
<HoodyNinja> cachi01|phone: 3 in the Lotr series
<BaconMane> 0,5THE MIGHTY ZEPHYRBLADE
<superretroworld> ive only read the hobbit, great book
<Meanwhile> Ikr.
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: WHat's it about?
<cachi01|phone> HoodyNinja fellowship of the ring part 1 and 2
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: that's because its fucking boring, but a good readd
<Shizuka> 13even atlas shrugged understood what paragraphs were
<Spectrum_Rush> inb4 Disemaudio ruins an epic scene
<Dark92Enigma> and i turned left toward the mid east
<cachi01|phone> The two towers part 1.and 2
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So many pillars
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: its lore heavy
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka wow
<RAWRity> Seriously. Tolkein was a fucking genius at world building, but his writing style was fucking dry as the sahara.
<cachi01|phone> And return of the king 1 and 2
<Shizuka> 13also yes, disembaudio syncs the "you shall not pass" line which totally blows the awesomeness of the scene
<HoodyNinja> cachi01|phone: Thats the extended edition movies
<tSparx> Me: Aw yeah, LotR! Me a second later: Aw, more Rifftrax!
<Canadian_Brony> gee, great
<RainbowDash90> MMMMUUUUUUFFFFFIIIIIINNNNNNNSSSSSSSSSS
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its a trap!
<Chocolate> hello everypony! What're we watching? :)
<Barbetos> diet sprite?
<Canadian_Brony> this will be . . . interesting?
<Barbetos> Ugh
<tSparx> (it was a good Aw!)
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka REALLY?

<Shizuka> 13yeah
<AJIsAwesome> Chocolate: Hello! LoTR.

<cachi01|phone> HoodyNinja i know but in my school library there is a book which contains all books
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka then i'll write it here to make it up for them
<Shizuka> 13thing is it's a good line to sync because everyone knows it's coming
<cachi01|phone> Inb4 Cry
<tSparx> Is it just me, or is the music way, way louder than the dialogue?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Damn thats a thick book
<HoodyNinja> cachi01|phone: Your school library is stoopid
<cachi01|phone> HoodyNinja yes it is lol
<Dark92Enigma> I feel his pain unlike the animated version
<HoodyNinja> SpadeMagnes[R]: My auto shop book is larger
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 Frodo dun goofed.
<Shizuka> 13tSparx: this sync has the riff in the left channel only, and quite a bit louder than the movie audio
<Dark92Enigma> HERE IT COMES
<HoodyNinja> and the safety section is six pages long
<Cypresswolf> And the book is never mentioned again
<tSparx> Ah kk
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Well fuck
<Shizuka> 13stream is in mono mode to balance the panning, and i have volume leveling on to bring the movie up
<Buytoast> oh boy
<Buytoast> here it comes
<Canadian_Brony> I wonder if they ever watched "Silent Movie". That would be kinda impossible to sync.
<cachi01|phone> INCOOOMIIIING
<Charlie_The_Bronco> YA DUN BEEN SHRUNK!
<Meanwhile> How can you tell if a shadow moves in the dark, exactly?
<Buytoast> goddammit
<Shizuka> 13so what pippin just did
<Reikim> So while I'm installing this game, care to give any pointers?
<cowvarkian> ikr Canadian_Brony
<cachi01|phone> BUUFFEEE
<Shizuka> 13we call that a nat 1
<cachi01|phone> R
<StinkomanFan> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU-
<HoodyNinja> Meanwhile: Its darker than the other darkness
<RAWRity> FOOL OF A TOOK
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: any way too shutup disemaudio for that one scene?
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Canadian_Brony> dat clanging
<Cypresswolf> Darnit Pippin! You've doomed us all!
<Shizuka> 13mm
<Shizuka> 13wait
<tSparx> The funniest thing is that this scene is even more comical in the book xD
<Barbetos> Dwarves have some talented stone masons.
<HoodyNinja> dat grounding
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Shizuka> 13i *might*
<Canadian_Brony> dat insult
<AJIsAwesome> Pippin dun goofed
<otakon> Barbetos: thats all they DO
<Shizuka> 13if you'll let me rewind a little?
<Canadian_Brony> sure
<Canadian_Brony> I don't mind
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Sure.
<HoodyNinja> GO FOR IT GIRL!
<StinkomanFan> DJ P0N-3'S A COMIN!
<Shizuka> 13nope
<RAWRity> Shizuka: eh, don't bother. It's a scene we've all seen plenty of times before.
<thelonepony> RUN!!!!!
<Rex_Mundi> Hey Shizuka- Do you have an OC pony?
<Shizuka> 13yep won't do it
<HoodyNinja> RAWRity: You, sir, are not a true nerd
<Cypresswolf> You've awokened the cheerleaders - they've waited centuries to show off their pep
<tSparx> "You cannot pass. You cannot pass. ... You cannot pass!" -- what Gandalf says in the book
<Shizuka> 13mike does a scary good robin williams
<Meanwhile> Movement is important, the minimap has a zoom function, f is the interact key, story is personalised, and names can have spaces.
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: :D
<HoodyNinja> Damn, i gotta go at 10:00, in 13 minutes
<cachi01|phone> ,
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I would make a arrow joke but I wont
<pony_4050> "They have a 4chan Troll!"
<cowvarkian> mork indeed
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: a true nerd means being mindlessly entertained by something I've seen plenty of times before for no other eason than that it's familir?
<Shizuka> 13Rex_Mundi: http://fav.me/d5bxohx
<Meanwhile> Give thought to your class choice.
<Shizuka> 13hm wait let me try something again
<tSparx> I've seen this scene a dozen times, heard the rifftrax 0 times.
<cachi01|phone> SpadeMagnes[R] u were about to say an arrow to the knee.joke
<Shizuka> 13after the battle
<pony_4050> "WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT JESUS!"
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka did kirz draw that?
<Rex_Mundi> Shizuka: How very lovely.
<Shizuka> 13ja kirz did :)
<cachi01|phone> BUT THE U TOOK AN ARROW TO THE KNEE
<HoodyNinja> RAWRity: Okay, your not a BIG lotr fans, you just dont mess with that scene
<HoodyNinja> Im sorry i've had this franchise in my childhood since i was 3
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka remind me to give him praise next time I see him, k?
<Shizuka> 13RAWRity: yeah we all know what he says and how he says it, just a shame that dis syncs it
<Barbetos> lol
<cachi01|phone> Dat mike tyson
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Woah
<RAWRity> HoodyNinja: I'm a lotr fan, but going to unnecessary trouble for a few lines of dialogue we all know already seems pointless
<p4ngya> ok that was pretty funny
<Shizuka> 13seems it converts to mono if i tell it to cut a channel
<Barbetos> That mike tyson impression
<Barbetos> lmao
<Reikim> Suggestions?
<Cades> oh no!
<Shizuka> 13so can't remove riff

<Cypresswolf> *Lothlorien
<Rex_Mundi> 1 human mage, 1 Dwarf warior, 1 night elf hunter, 2 human wariors, 4 gnome. Low level loot fetch quest.
<Canadian_Brony> these elves talk funny
<Shizuka> 13i wouldn't put boromir in mage
<pony_4050> You, Sean Bean, will die in this movie, as well
<Shizuka> 13cleric at most
<Cypresswolf> And then Boromir was sent to the moon
<pony_4050> As it is your fate
<Shizuka> 13wait
<Rex_Mundi> Shizuka: Gandalf
<RAWRity> Boromir's the Cannon fodder
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: Aragorn's a ranger
<Shizuka> 13oh you meant gandalf
<Shizuka> 13deeeerp
<tSparx> He dual-classes warrior in Return of the King
<pony_4050> "Let's get HAMMERED! This is a Jägermeister-Fountain!"
<Charlie_The_Bronco> can ponies do jagerbombs?
<Shizuka> 13gandalf pretty much multiclasses everything by the end
<Charlie_The_Bronco> i think they can
<Ryunosuke> well gandalf could be 4th ed mage ;)
<Charlie_The_Bronco> gandalf should have been in a nursing home by the end
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: boromir as barbarian?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: and Sam doubles as a pack mule
<Rex_Mundi> Gandelf teled back to Lumbridge
<pony_4050> Introducing Morgan Freeman: "Lemme tell you something. Hope is a dangerious thing!"
<Shizuka> 13ubiquitous bad guy
<tSparx> Charlie_The_Bronco: Gandalf is an ancient spirit who's existed since almost the beginning of the world.
<Ryunosuke> boromir would be a fighter
<Ryunosuke> either tank or dps
<Charlie_The_Bronco> nursing home. rest my case
<Shizuka> 13Rex_Mundi: gandalf's busy looking at his items, uncrating a few boxes, he'll pick his class and get back next movie
<tSparx> Charlie_The_Bronco: He's *immortal*
<Reikim> What.
<RAWRity> considering how many arrows Boromir can take, I'd say he makes a good Tank
<Reikim> Just read that post and...what.
<Malk> broke back mount doom
<Barbetos> Shizuka then they the devs found that gandalf cheated to get them stats, and banned bim by way of boat from Middle Earth.
<tSparx> Malk: LAWL
<Charlie_The_Bronco> so are rocks, doesnt make them good sorcers
<Shizuka> 13gandalf gets VAC banned
<Rex_Mundi> Shizuka: Maybe hell try that "Melee hunter" thingy.
<pony_4050> Shit, seeing Sean Bean reminds me that I have to wait almost a year still till the next season of Games Of Thrones! DAMMIT!"
<Ihop> lies you die b man
<Shizuka> 13frodo too for completely breaking the most powerful game artifact
<pony_4050> "Here, take a sip from the Jägermeister-Fountain!"
<Barbetos> Gandalf had like 1000 dollars worth the games too.
<tSparx> Gandalf is a mage, dual-classes warrior. Boromir's a tank warrior. Aragorn's a ranger, dual-classes dps warrior.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: not to mention completely fucking up the final instance.
<Charlie_The_Bronco> nnoooo....noooooo....a miser gandalf no home...nooooo
<Shizuka> 13totally crashed the mordor server
<tSparx> Gimli's a tank warrior, Legolas a ranger
<Rex_Mundi> Aragorn would be a rouge
<Malk> Drink the sunny-d
<Charlie_The_Bronco> nooo..noooo a miser gandalf he no home
<Ryunosuke> Barbetos, it would also depend on the rules you are using :)
<Meanwhile> Rex_Mundi: rogue*
<Malk> It is good sunny-d
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: No, like, Aragorn *is* a ranger.
<Ryunosuke> aragorn is ranger/fighter
<Ihop> boromir fail tank 2 stabs dies
<Shizuka> 13aragorn's ranks in tracking and such definitely put him into ranger
<tSparx> Rex_Mundi: When they first meet him, he's known as the most famous ranger in the lands surrounding the shire.
<Ryunosuke> ihop he rolled critical fails
<Rex_Mundi> I know
<Shizuka> 13he puts a level or two in fighter before the end though
<Barbetos> And then after the banning of Frodo and Gandalf, the guild Fellowship of the Rings was just not the same. With everyone assuming it was full of hackers, the prestige was never restored.
<Shizuka> 13a vision of lord of the rings as directed by michael bay
<tSparx> The one scene that's, imo, better than the book, right here.
<pony_4050> "This is Wacken 2013!"
<Shizuka> 13frodo is that a ring in your chest or are you happy to see her?
<Ryunosuke> most elves are either rangers or Fighters (Bow spec.)
<Ryunosuke> or mages
<tSparx> Stirder the Ranger.
<Shizuka> 13they couldn't afford to animate her mouth this scene
<Rex_Mundi> Aragorn puts his skill points into Melee and unarmed, witch is redundent he should have put some points into guns. With his agility set to 9... wait... wrong game.

<twilight_sprinkle> glorious audio desync
<Dermathil> Reikim: also, if they were planted in the ground they are more likely to cause infection.
<Cades> make sure they suffer
<Malk> Canadian_brony can you read every fanfic and show me the good ones?
<Reikim> Arrows are one of the most ineffective instruments of murder...but one of the greatest at maiming/crippling/hindering
<shibaru> Yup~
<cachi01|phone> Ded....
<flutter_spin> I recall "Twilight needs a new quill" , "Pinkie watches paint dry" , and "Days of Wasp & Spider"
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin read the story and make it 11. Comedy, Slice of Life. Not too large, but still really good.
<tSparx> They're also really cheap, and easy to mass produce.
<Charlie_The_Bronco> hey what is this wallet made of its really nice.....oh yeah....my younliiiinggss :'(
<Cades> i have an idea
<Rex_Mundi> For Winterfell
<Cades> death by bass ;)
<flutter_spin> And even those I vaguely read through
<cachi01|phone> SLOW DEAD IS SLOW
<shibaru> Hmm?
<Reikim> Oh? Are we talking fanfiction again? White Box.
<Shizuka> 13luna in a special cameo as legolas
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: Arw those normal fanfics?
<Reikim> White. Box. Best fanfic I have ever read.
<flutter_spin> define normal.
<RAWRity> I've read "...and the Kitchen Sink" where Rainbow Dash falls in love with an actual Kitchen sink
<Malk> tSparx and the crossbow is deadly when you have tons of farmers fighting for you
<cachi01|phone> twilight gets a free salad
<Ihop> oh captain my captain
<flutter_spin> The guy who did "Days of Wasp & Spider" redid it like 50 times. It surprised me of the detail put into it.
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome the first and second are comedies, not sure about the third.
<Cades> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYGioWinQQE
<Cades> something like that
<tSparx> RAWRity: See, this is why I don't read fanfic, right there
<AJIsAwesome> Technically, there is no "Best" when it comes to fanfics. Just really good.
<flutter_spin> "Twilight needs a new quill" is kind of the first one I actually wanted to read. Kind of weird.
<tSparx> RAWRity: It could even be good, Idc.
<Reikim> RAWRity: Have you read White Box yet?
<flutter_spin> "Pinkie watches paint dry" really freaked me out. A new take on such a simple matter. I kind of stopped reading after it.
<Derpy_Hooves> going to bed
<Canadian_Brony> Who here read, and really liked, "Rainbow Factory"?
<tSparx> Night Derpy_Hooves
<Rex_Mundi> Has anyone huged RAWRity today?
<Reikim> Not discussing.
<Malk> Someone needs to make a fanfic site with the good ones
<Shizuka> 13come on guys enough of the creepy fanfics
<Canadian_Brony> I'm asking because a sequel is being written
<Shizuka> 13movie time
<Reikim> We are not discussing that one.
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka ok

<Canadian_Brony> g'night Derpy_Hooves
<AJIsAwesome> Dermathil: Night!
<Dermathil> uh?
<flutter_spin> But seriously, yeah, I don't read fanfics. I just write my own little fanfics and hope people read them.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: to be fair "...and The Kitchen Sink" is actually kind of romantic.
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Read. White Box.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony cool rifftrax lotr
<Barbetos> Still on about that stupid litter.
<flutter_spin> lol

<Canadian_Brony> hi Sketch_Toku_Brony. Eeyup
<AJIsAwesome> We should get back to the Rifftrax.:$
<Canadian_Brony> wait a sec . . . holy crap almost over already?
<Dermathil> The movie trivia for the LOTR movies are so good.
<Rex_Mundi> What I never got, what does the Silmarills actually do, the Book never says.
<Cades> i fucking hate that tune
<Dermathil> and here comes the glass shard.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Frodo needs some inspirational 80s music
<tSparx> Canadian_Brony: ALREADY? I got here at MORIA and I'm already amazed at how long this has been.
<Reikim> Rex_Mundi: Isn't there another book that tells that?
<flutter_spin> I remember someone saying, "You want featured? Write shipping, gore, or anything ponies don't usually do. You get the big crowd, but hate yourself in the morning for writing it"
<Shizuka> 13three hour movie
<shibaru> I hope Mike continues the let's play he started c:
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx I've been here the entire time.
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Featured on what?
<Shizuka> 13longer than return of the king i think, that's only like 2:45
<Canadian_Brony> Sam sinks like a stone
<flutter_spin> featured on Fimfiction :P
<StinkomanFan> NOT SAM! I LIKED SAM!
<Barbetos> he does that really good
<Cades> what game?
<AJIsAwesome> StinkomanFan: Don't worry.
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Who cares about that? I don't need it. As long as I can get on EQD I'm proud.
<Rex_Mundi> Call apon the Sea ponies!
<Ryunosuke> sam should have called upon the sea ponies
<flutter_spin> This part, I actually had to ask my brother "What, he can't swim?" and he explained to me about hobbits and water :P
<shibaru> http://youtu.be/BRkWLH1pJiQ
<Maid_RainBow> SHOO BE DOO Call apon the Seaponies
<tSparx> Wait, is there anyone here who's unfamiliar with this story?

<AJIsAwesome> Oh, I didn't know Hobbits couldn't swim.
<VenHur> flutter_spin: So true, it has a meaning that more attention makes you less the man you wanted to be, it's a path that must starts off small, or in a big way.
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: They're like Gorons
<Rex_Mundi> How does one call apon the sea ponies when your drowning?
<shibaru> Watching it for the third time xD
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Mostly
<RAWRity> Shizuka: not the extended cut. That's over 4 hours.
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: :D
<Canadian_Brony> RAWRity holy crap that works
<Dark92Enigma> D'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwww <3
<Canadian_Brony> I like that ending
<flutter_spin> lol
<Reikim> Well that accomplished nothing.
<tSparx> AJIsAwesome: Frodo and his family (not the Baggins but the other ones, can't remember their name) are considered weird because they're big boaters.
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: I didn't remember
<AJIsAwesome> tSparx: Ok.

<Reikim> Also antics in manechat, but really, manechat in general accomplishes nothing.
<AJIsAwesome> Can anyone explain the "Press X" meme to me?
<Barbetos> Quicktime events?
<AJIsAwesome> RAWRity: I'm not sure if I want to click that...
<flutter_spin> RAWRity: I remember that pic
<Barbetos> Probably X to jason really

<desertman2> It has something to do with Youtube videos
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
<Rex_Mundi> AJIsAwesome: you want to click that
<VenHur> Press Right to Win
<Reikim> AJIsAwesome: General criticism of quicktime events. You know, when the game yells "PRESS A!" or something.
<flutter_spin> I had to wait a second before clicking to make sure :P
<shibaru> I love his voice so much :) I love almost everything about him xD
<StinkomanFan> AJIsAwesome, You mean Jason what?
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Ok.
<StinkomanFan> PRESS X TO FRODO
<Reikim> Either way, I still think everyone should read White Box.

<Reikim> It is amazing.
<Reikim> I love it beyond words.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> already read it good stuff
<Barbetos> tSparx nice.
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 Pyro is really creepy at the end...
<Reikim> My heart tries to break apart every time I read it.
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx I threw myself at the ground once.
<Barbetos> I need to finish the last book in that series.
<flutter_spin> or find a hole that goes through the ground
<Shizuka> 13here we go
<RaveBrony> Back ,what have i missed? :P
<otakon> O_o

<flutter_spin> LOL
<shibaru> I wonder if the grey man would scare him...
<Shizuka> 13sounds awesome
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx :D
<otakon> POTATO!
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: inb4 Pyro gives me nightmares.
<Reikim> I ranted about the poor state of the common man's understanding of the English language.

<Cades> lol
<Canadian_Brony> tSparx I did it yesterday by accident. I tripped on the stairs while going up. My father comes over and says "What did you do?" I said "I tried to throw myself at the ground and miss. I didn't miss."
<tSparx> Shizuka: It was the only one I spent a ton of time on. It didn't take me long to figure out, roughly, what I had to do, but it took me HOURS to finagle everything just right.
<Cades> LOL IT HAPPENED TO ME
<Cades> FUCK OFF GREY MAN

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai kirzstryfe
<kirzstryfe> good evening everypony :)
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo oh, nevermind. Talking to your cousins on Skype isn't as fun as IRL, cuz then you can gang-up on one, wrap him in a blanket, stuff him in a box, wrap that in a blanket, turn it upside-down, and watch him try to get out. Somehow it's always me.
<kirzstryfe> hey
<Ponies47> Hey kirzstryfe!
<Meanwhile> Allo kirz.
<cachi01|phone> Eddmario if u see Andrew wk in something It means epicness
<Canadian_Brony> hi kirzstryfe
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03...yes... exactly Canadian_Brony
<Malk> Hi Krizstryfe

<cachi01|phone> (\
<Meanwhile> How was work anyway?
<Ryunosuke> hey kirzstryfe
<kirzstryfe> not sure which server I want to end up on, or if anyone's decided on one everyone can agree on
<Maid_RainBow> (\
<Canadian_Brony> kirzstryfe I saw your finished drawing of "Shizuka's Bakery". Dayum, that is good!
<Reikim> I think US is a good idea.
<Malk> :)
<Moopy> hey shizuka bill nye is way better then spongebob
<Reikim> Also kirz I got GW2!
<kirzstryfe> long, 8 3/4 hours training, 5 days/week for the next 11 weeks
<cachi01|phone> ^^
<Meanwhile> You're the only other person whose playing I'm aware of.
<kirzstryfe> :)
<Reikim> It is updating!
<cachi01|phone> Moopy NO
<cachi01|phone> NO
<Moopy> eeyup
<Shizuka> 13http://fav.me/d5bxohx kirzplug
<kirzstryfe> I'm on Stormbluff Isle I think, let me check
<Meanwhile> Rei is still loading and T doesn't mention it.
<Malk> eenope
<Canadian_Brony> that one!
<Moopy> eeyup
<Reikim> Right now I'm looking at something like 5 GB of patches! It is ridiculous!
<Reikim> And it only released under a week ago!
<Reikim> Argharghargh
<Phase4> does GW2 have a demo?
<Meanwhile> Pfft. 5GB of patches.
<Malk> Shizuka do you make blue berry muffins?
<kirzstryfe> yeah, I'm just glad I had most of it downloaded already from the betas
<kirzstryfe> no demo yet
<Shizuka> 13nope
<Canadian_Brony> no stream . . . epic MV http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVCFV7jT9ho
<Reikim> I actually got it on disc, k?
<Reikim> And yet
<Meanwhile> Can you imagine if you tried to load WoW, from scratch, right now?
<Reikim> HOURS OF UPDATING
<kirzstryfe> silly Shizuka <3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> haven't buy it yet but will do in a close future
<Ponies47> Moopy: I like Spongebob :<
<Canadian_Brony> *PMV
<Shizuka> 13also
<Ponies47> Spongebob is kewl :3
<Moopy> oh
<Shizuka> 13those of you with l4d1
<Reikim> Loading WoW from scratch, right now, would involve me sticking a knife into my hypothalamus.
<Phase4> Meanwhile, i installed wow from scratch about 4 or 5 years ago
<Shizuka> 13http://www.ihatemountains.com/download-left-4-dead-1/ DO IT NOW
<kirzstryfe> I've reloaded WoW once, took the better part of a day
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> buy it or bought not sure ...
<Malk> Kuddle buns
<Phase4> Meanwhile, it was 12GB then
<Meanwhile> 4 or 5 years ago. Pfft. You'd be running TBC.
<Jmo> Dat map.
<Jmo> I still remember playing it x_x
<Meanwhile> 2 expansions later.
<Phase4> i cant remember dates
<Eddmario> Shizuka: I would, but I have the console verison of the game, and it's back home with my brother in Illinois
<Phase4> think it was 4 or 5
<Shizuka> 13it's like above valve quality
<Ponies47> I shoudl add more games to my Steam when I get my new computer. Which should be Friday! :D
<cachi01|phone> Wow its from the creators of portal prelude
<Moopy> hey you ponies want to hear something great well watch this click the link here
<Ponies47> *should
<Moopy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7zEmtB2giU&feature=player_detailpage
<cachi01|phone> Must be good
<Reikim> Good golly, I can't imagine that the game will be able to top itself after this!
<cachi01|phone> Dem farts
<Reikim> I mean, who could possibly hope to outdo this loading sequence?
<Eddmario> Shizuka: Wasn't Cold Stream, the newest L4D2 DLC, originally a mod for the PC version?
<cachi01|phone> And dat kik
<Reikim> Even IF the artwork is gorgeous!
<Meanwhile> Look at him, all bright eyed and shiny.
<Moopy> sorry guys cheese
<kirzstryfe> hehe
<kirzstryfe> haven't seen the boxed version load screens
<Ponies47> What was the link? I'm not clicking it with how my computer is -_-
<Reikim> Oh it's gorgeoous.
<cachi01|phone> Ponies47 SFM farting
<Meanwhile> I can't imagine his first five minutes...
<Eddmario> So, I see the next A movie is based on a newspaper comic strip
<kirzstryfe> I'm guessing it's the same style as the intro videos though
<Meanwhile> "Look at all the buttons!"
<Reikim> I want to find the artist who created this, shiv him, and then absorb his soul.
<Moopy> well i told you guys its funny untill i got kicked
<cachi01|phone> SfM ponies on a fart compertition
<Reikim> Oh there were no buttons.
<Ponies47> cachi01|phone: =_(\ Wow
<Reikim> There was, however, a COLOURED BAR.
<Reikim> And it was all white but then it became less white and more red.
<kirzstryfe> yeah, Stormbluff Isle, was one of the only US servers that wasn't capped on the first day
<Reikim> And then it was full!
<Reikim> And then I LOGGED IN!
<Canadian_Brony> Not much can feel more awkward than your mother walking in while singing along to a song.
<kirzstryfe> runs medium pop I think, which is good
<Reikim> It was exciting.
<Ponies47> And my chat is derping
<Moopy> im sorry i will never do that link ever again
<kirzstryfe> so Meanwhile, swap to my server :3
<Meanwhile> You're on US, my connection'd be fudge.
<cachi01|phone> Fun fact: wow backwards is platypusdinosaurwordijustinventedandnomayonnaiseaintaninstrument
<flutter_spin> Alright Every pony. This is all I have to say right now: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsMaBta4SxI
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin with what?
<Phase4> i've seen gw2 screenshots
<kirzstryfe> yeah >.<
<flutter_spin> (for tonight)
<Phase4> they know how to art
<Reikim> So what, should we fiind a halfways server?
<Shizuka> 13a poorly captured video of a television?
<Shizuka> 13i see
<Reikim> Like one in New Zealand?
<Meanwhile> I got clocked in the face by spiders earlier because of a bit of lag delay, I can't imagine what that'd be like.
<Reikim> Yes, good God the GW2 staff know how to art.
<Jmo> Professionaaaal.
<cachi01|phone> Btw guys what do you think of the square enix in-browser game feature?
<flutter_spin> :( I couldn't find a good clip
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin done with what?
<kirzstryfe> that they do
<flutter_spin> I'm done watching stream :P
<Canadian_Brony> . . .
<Reikim> Half the development cycle must have been dumped into solely art.
<kirzstryfe> they've had 6 years to work on it though, so it'd had better have been good
<Canadian_Brony> as in, it just stopped?
<cachi01|phone> Ponies47 y new name?
<Jmo> >__>
<Reikim> They probably chained brilliant minds to desks and commanded them to churn out beauty by the bucket.
<flutter_spin> Fine. I instantly thought of it when the stream ended, but couldn't find a clip of it
<Reikim> Only the extremes of hunger and fatigue could create this.
<Canadian_Brony> oh
<Canadian_Brony> okay
<cachi01|phone> mmm watchaaa saaay
<flutter_spin> So when I finally DID find a reference to it... the gag was already gone
<Canadian_Brony> gotta remember that
<kirzstryfe> when you do start though, never underestimate a Skale
<Reikim> Starvation is the key to TRUE ART
<Canadian_Brony> darn
<Reikim> Skale?
<flutter_spin> cachi01|phone: dat imogen
<kirzstryfe> bipedal fish things
<cachi01|phone> Eeyup lol
<kirzstryfe> can regen health like crazy if you don't finish them off
<flutter_spin> imogen heap: hide and seek
<Canadian_Brony> have a Hoedown http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlB1CLbEewU&NR=1&feature=endscreen
<cachi01|phone> hide and seek is best kiñling song
<cachi01|phone> Killing*
<Moopy> come on dude im trying to make everypony happy about the link i sent i mean come on the kicking........really
<Canadian_Brony> "Your mother is a drunk"
<Canadian_Brony> topic of the hoedown
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Phase4> they probably just took their time
<Meanwhile> Skale are pansies.
<Phase4> thought about it
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIIwwCi2zwk check this one out (its long, but funny)
<Phase4> and built it as they go
<Meanwhile> I went through them like a weedwhacker.
<cachi01|phone> Mmmmmmmm http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLyzscHXtWM&feature=youtube_gdata_player
<Phase4> unlike something like swtor which was $200,000,000 spent on overpaid contractors
<cachi01|phone> flutter_spin not available for phones
<kirzstryfe> yeah, but if you let one live thinking it'll die from dots or something, they can surprise you
<Phase4> EA doesnt know how to art
<Meanwhile> So as it is, I think I /can/ move to the server in question, but I dunno if it'd take a while or if it'd be screwy when I did.
<flutter_spin> cachi01|phone: that's old
<flutter_spin> I remember that from years ago
<Phase4> i want to try gw2 :(
<cachi01|phone> Dear sister is an old meme...
<cachi01|phone> Its a meme right
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin you have one bucked up textbook
<cachi01|phone> Right?
<flutter_spin> Canadian_Brony: lol
<Ponies47> Why do I keep losing coneection to the server!?! :[
<Ponies47> *connection
<Reikim> Shell out 67 USD and you, too, can experience the joy of patching.
<Jmo> The server doesn't like you. o.o
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin I can't stop laughing! This is great!
<cachi01|phone> Weeeird phone is weird
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO7tseyAMF0 another one
<Meanwhile> lol
<kirzstryfe> I have a pet shark :3
<cachi01|phone> Writes Ponies47 and i get Penis47 in the suggestions
<Moopy> that was not funny at all dude
<Meanwhile> I can stomp so hard things near me go flying.
<Big_Macintosh_1992> bye everyone
<Reikim> If you really want to have fun, though, try League of Legends.
*Ponies47 Slaps cachi01|phone "Shuda up"
<Ponies47> Later Big_Macintosh_1992
<Maid_RainBow> bye bye everypony have to go to work
<Reikim> The ULTIMATE patching experience, and it's ABSOLUTELY FREE.
<Meanwhile> Huehuehue.
<cachi01|phone> Ponies let me send u pic
<cachi01|phone> Its not a joke
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin do you have to do the problems IRL, or are you doing it for LoLz?
<Canadian_Brony> seeya Big_Macintosh_1992
<Ponies47> Later Maid_RainBow ;)
<Eddmario> Needs more sweedish redneck techno: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gFyKFEsCeo
<Ponies47> cachi01|phone: Don't you dare -_-
<Phase4> Reikim, plus you get to run around saying you play 'LoL'
<flutter_spin> Canadian_Brony: lol. They aren't mine, if you are implying that.
<Reikim> The best part of it?
<Canadian_Brony> ah
<Canadian_Brony> ok
<kirzstryfe> gw2 even comes with a platforming minigame :3
<Canadian_Brony> nvmd
<Reikim> They release a new patch practically every other week, if not more!
<Reikim> So you can have fun OVER AND OVER AGAIN!
<Canadian_Brony> makes you wonder, tho
<Meanwhile> The last time I platformed on here, I got hit in the foot by a trebuchet and flew forty feet to my death.
<Reikim> Ouch.
<flutter_spin> yeah definitely
<Reikim> Okay, think I'm done being bitterly sarcastic, anyone up for an MvM game.
<Reikim> ?
<flutter_spin> No Artie did it. The same guy who did EXTREME <insert here> : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrSwaA-FAj4
<Canadian_Brony> so much tinfoil
<cachi01|phone> Accept the file ponies47!
<flutter_spin> (may want to turn it down a little)
*Panda|Doingstuff looks at Moopy
<VenHur> Well folks, gtg for the night...
<Canadian_Brony> seeya VenHur
<cachi01|phone> Night VenHur :)

<Moopy> umm.....ok
<Canadian_Brony> so much yelling
<Reikim> Team BStateRegs is best bot-bashing team.
<flutter_spin> ugh. rap.
<kirzstryfe> I have to stay ahead of Meanwhile on the levelling curve >.>
<cachi01|phone> ^
<Reikim> Can't you...can't you both take a break? Mebbe?
<Reikim> So I don't fall even more behind?
<Ponies47> Night Ve.....awwww :<
<Reikim> I'm still twelve hours away from actually playing.
<cachi01|phone> Told u it wasnt a joke
<Meanwhile> But I just moved server, I have to see if I can flatten kirzs head with my shield.
<flutter_spin> Naw. Artie just has a lot of "we are a bunch of guys coming up with crazy stuff to do on our spare time" type of guys
*Reikim sighs
<Reikim> Fiiiiiiine
<Reikim> I'd much rather see it myself but fiiiiiine
<kirzstryfe> you know, stuff patches faster if you're not downloading other stuff :P
<Reikim> 'M not!
<Shizuka> 13uh huh
<Shizuka> 13we all know your pony addiction
<Reikim> No
<Reikim> No that is not a thing
<Reikim> Don't judge me!
<Panda|Doingstuff> Moopy fine then, dont say hi :(
<cachi01|phone> Ded chat is ded
<Moopy> what im just playing left 4 dead 2 with my friend on the xbox
*Reikim quickly hides his ponies
<superretroworld> he dead
<cachi01|phone> Dead
<RainbowDash90> that friend is me :D
<RainbowDash90> lol
<flutter_spin> Artie does a ton of impersonations. My personal favorite is from Uncle Buck: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k4O_id93o0 Yes, that's his voice.
<cachi01|phone> That weird moment when you realize ezio VA is the same as sonic
<flutter_spin> Ezio?
<kirzstryfe> that's not what ponies are for...
<cachi01|phone> Auditore
<superretroworld> really? who plays them?
<Ponies47> Ponies47: What the buck? I'm on my computer and I see no p***s47 here :|
<flutter_spin> oh oh Assassins Creed
<flutter_spin> I'm bad with personal names
<Ponies47> That's just sick -_-
<Reikim> What are they for, then?
<cachi01|phone> Roger Crai
<cachi01|phone> G
<Reikim> I cannot think of any concievable use for ponies other than watching them out of amusement.
<cachi01|phone> Ponies47 ikr
<superretroworld> Ponies47: is there an impersonater?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I really dont see me buying a laptop since all I'm gonna do with it is play WoW and other shit and watch streams and youtube
<flutter_spin> I'm just going through this out there. Not sure if anyone will have fun with it. http://www.incredibox.com
<Reikim> I suppose, were they larger, one might ride them as a form of transport.
<cachi01|phone> Incredibox?
<flutter_spin> its a sound mixer type of application
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02dX6VexfcA&list=PL297445C6A3381D39&index=55&feature=plpp_video
<cachi01|phone> Thx.for the eargasm spade

<Ponies47> superretroworld: I think cachi's phone is messing with him
<flutter_spin> I didn't think it was too loud
<Reikim> Why can't I play Half-Life 2?
<cachi01|phone> eargasm is a good thing

<Petrified_Discord> flutter_spin: This is strangely addicting :)
<flutter_spin> yes it is Petrified_Discord
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25m3wuYo994 Oh hey new rubberfruit video
<flutter_spin> It is also v2. Much better than v1, but the other has different sound effects
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> volibear so awesome
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> anyway is there enough people for MvM ?
<cachi01|phone> LOL Shizuka
<Reikim> What, he's the giant armoured polar bear isn't he?
<Reikim> Well, there's me.
<Meanwhile> Yo kirz, you paying attention?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim yes he is
<Reikim> Meanwhile seems to be occupied, so that eliminates the only other potential player I can think of.
<Meanwhile> I'm trying to figure out if I'm actually on the server or not.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizu want to play MvM ?
<Meanwhile> My UI says yes, kirz says no.
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Shizuka> 13not sure
<flutter_spin> dat random vid...
<superretroworld> cachi01|phone: like music?
<Meanwhile> I guess I can wrap up this story quest and come play.
<Ponies47> Ugh. My computer is glitching up agian. When it masks me afor somthing a white box appears problem is the box is just blank and I can't do anything about it :|
<Reikim> Okay, so pin Shizu as a "maybe".
<cachi01|phone> Yep i like music
<Reikim> Same with Meanwhile.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe leave guild wars and come to play MvM
*SpadeMagnes[R] throws a tumble weed
<flutter_spin> sorry. Still having fun with Incredibox
<Reikim> You could probably go into manechat and make Phase fail another will save, if he's there.
<cachi01|phone> Ponies47 kick it and if that doesnt work use duct tape
<SpadeMagnes[R]> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3XeLmQBDeM&feature=BFa&list=PL297445C6A3381D39
<Reikim> I dunno, for whatever reason I can't see.
<superretroworld> cachi01|phone: no i mean is eargasm liek listening to good music?
<Ponies47> cachi01|phone: Duct tapes solves all problems! :D

<Canadian_Brony> don't worry
<Reikim> Oh, and Shizu possibly, that would make six.
<Spectrum_Rush> its only a gif
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kirzstryfe then don't get mad if someone steal your spot :p
<SpadeMagnes[R]> man this place is quiet as a crypt
<superretroworld> what is a gif exactly?
<Reikim> Nobody's going to steal it.
<Moopy> sorry rainbowdash90 my time limit from my step dads computer dude sorry
<cachi01|phone> Dat sexy pinkie
<Kammerjunk> You wouldn't download a police officer!
<flutter_spin> Pinkie dancing like gandam
<Canadian_Brony> flutter_spin :D IE is a dead horse
<SpadeMagnes[R]> What ever that is
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim inb4 someone joins
<Reikim> Bah
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Canadian_Brony: Yet my school insists on using it ._.
<Reikim> Even if they do it'll leave a spot open.
<cachi01|phone> IE is Chrome's bitch
<Reikim> Now let's see if I can actually, yknow, get Steam to start TF2.
<Kammerjunk> IE is the best browser for downloading another browser.
<Canadian_Brony> the only use for IE is to download a new browser
<cachi01|phone> ^^
<cachi01|phone> ^
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Never use IE and is good in the same sentence
<kirzstryfe> what should our guild name be? (hint: not Bronystate)
<flutter_spin> My mom invited some people over and I asked them about their browser. They said Firefox. I suggested Google Chrome and he said, "I don't use anything by google. They monitor what you type"
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> prince-dari I am printing out a twilight sparkle on my 3d printer :P
<Reikim> It should be
<Reikim> Um
<SpadeMagnes[R]> unless its IE is good for getting a new browser
<Reikim> Shoot I'm bad at this.
<Celes_Chere> To say IE is good is a prequalification for mental insanity
<flutter_spin> I am dead serious. So they don't use google mail, google search, google maps, google....
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So that guy is paranoid?
<Kammerjunk> flutter_spin: Well, yeah. Google collects everything they damn well can about you, and that's what makes them so good.
<cachi01|phone> flutter_spin XDDDDDDDDD
<Ponies47> http://ponies47.deviantart.com/#/d5cszwb Dawwwwww :3
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Does this guy wear tinfoil?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> the League of justice!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> wait i heard that before
<Reikim> Anything I come up with will either be satirical or an anime reference, just because I suck ass at naming.
<flutter_spin> His excuse was something about searching for a school and suddenly his inbox was full of ads. He came to that conclusion.
<Kammerjunk> Bing might think you're looking for blasphemic pictures, but Google knows what you're actually searching for when you type "Jesus fucking Christ".
<Celes_Chere> the pony's face is all...wat
<cachi01|phone> Dat filly pony ponies
<kirzstryfe> tempted to go with one of the old guild names I've had, either Bastion or Cupcake Kitten Brigade
<cachi01|phone> PONYCEPTION?
<flutter_spin> He doesn't use Bing either.
<Celes_Chere> nvm i'm going blind ;_;
<Shizuka> 13guild name?
<kirzstryfe> yeah
<Shizuka> 13guild of ponies
<Reikim> Make it
<Ponies47> Celes_Chere: That's my OC as a wittle colt. :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Cupcake Kitten Brigade sounds cool
<Reikim> The Technicolour Pony Brigade.
<Reikim> That, or the Steel Rangers because reference.
<Shizuka> 13flaming fist

<cachi01|phone> Ponies47 ur oc looks like bronydanceparty OC
<Reikim> Oh, we're going to be like that then.
<Malk> anyone wana play tf2?
<Reikim> um
<Reikim> Shoot
<SaxyPretender> 0,14The Buster WOlves
<Reikim> I'm all out of reference NO SAXY
<Meanwhile> Never end a guild name with the letter s.
<Ponies47> Celes_Chere: The colt faces that pony maker has SUCK. That's really a Celestia face. Fine by me :P
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Cool league of ponies kirzstryfe
<Yahooz> Busted Wolves
<cachi01|phone> I CANT PLAY TF2 :[
<Kammerjunk> Nah, I gotta get some UNIX learning done.
<Ponies47> cachi01|phone: But I liek my OC :<

<SaxyPretender> 0,14the Kewl Kids Club?

<Celes_Chere> Ponies47: Apparently she's working on a better version for the iPhone
<kirzstryfe> -.-
<kirzstryfe> bad Yahooz
<Ponies47> Celes_Chere: O.O
<Yahooz> The overall cool guys guild?
<Reikim> Okay, looking up references. Again.
<Meanwhile> League of Extraordinary Gentlefolk.
<Ponies47> Celes_Chere: YA- Oh wait I don't have a Iphone. :/
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yep no one got it or most are just ignoring it
<flutter_spin> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/24300/Drocsid my fanfic plug
<Reikim> I'd suggest the Gurren Brigade but fuck no.
<Reikim> Oh
<sub06905|iPod> :p
<Yahooz> Order of the Unrustled Jimmies
<Reikim> Name us NERV. Or SEELE. Because Evangelion.
<Meanwhile> I find that the best guild names are fairly short.
<kirzstryfe> probably too long, Yahooz
<Celes_Chere> http://generalzoi.tumblr.com/post/28132018204/pony-creator-update
<Reikim> Fight Club?
<Shizuka> 13Equine Victory Alliance
<Canadian_Brony> I haven't even started my fan-fic
<Yahooz> ScootaChicken would aproove
<kirzstryfe> going with an iconic name sets bad standards for the guild, I've found
<Reikim> Aha Shizu, I see what you did there.
<Meanwhile> Indeed.
*Dov is uber procrastinating on his fanfic.
<flutter_spin> heh. I've been working on my fanfic ever since Season 2 ended
<cachi01|phone> Mah oc looking at something that makes him happy http://My-Life-With-Ponies.deviantart.com/art/My-OC-Cachi-321044189?qo=0&catpath=gallery:my-life-with-ponies:36928323&order=0&offset=0
<Canadian_Brony> my third one, that is
<Shizuka> 13Equine Victory Alliance
<flutter_spin> I think I'm up to about 70,000 words total
<flutter_spin> I shoot for 1,000 words a day (roughly)
*Celes_Chere is procrastinating on 4 fanfics...at once
<Yahooz> Gondor Guild
*Ponies47 Has never wrote a fanfic
<Reikim> All in favour of the Equine Victory Alliance, hit Meanwhile with a brick.
<Meanwhile> You're better off with something that sounds good, doesn't have any particular links to irl things and isn't too lengthy.
<kirzstryfe> but then nobody would ever be able to find us
*Kammerjunk has never uploaded a fanfic.
<Dov> Celes_Chere: tsk tsk tsk
*cachi01|phone was planning on doing a fanfic
*Celes_Chere is not pressuring Ponies47 : >_>
<Reikim> Yeah, that's what I thought.
*cachi01|phone is too lazy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Will anihilated leagues leaders eternaly
<superretroworld> id love to write a fanfic, just need to think of a story
*Celes_Chere wonders about all of the actions
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Wall-e for short
<kirzstryfe> of course, I have to find the damn guild registrar again first
<Canadian_Brony> I'm still planning my fic
<Canadian_Brony> I don't know how to start it off
<Reikim> Damn we suck at naming things.
<cachi01|phone> i,can give you my story if you want superretworld
<Celes_Chere> Canadian_Brony: Start at the middle, maybe?
<flutter_spin> My writing keeps improving. Yes, I've included the mods here in my story, especially S-U-M-.. well you know
<Ponies47> I have no idea what to make a fanfic about. Plus story making ain't worth a (squee) :/
<Dov> I hit a wall in my fan fic.... (damn filler chapter)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim told you someone will join
<Meanwhile> Well, what do we want the guild to say?
<Reikim> That would be because I have Malk as a friend.
<Kammerjunk> >iPhone
<Kammerjunk> >Flash
<Kammerjunk> Sorry, what?
<Reikim> Hm
<Reikim> What do we want the guild to say?
<cachi01|phone> Iphone has flash?
<kirzstryfe> Equine Victory Alliance [PONY]
<Kammerjunk> Hah, no.
<kirzstryfe> ?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim i have it to i think that's why i told you
<kirzstryfe> :3
<Barbetos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH72I1NmxWg
<flutter_spin> Ponies47: I think it comes down to what you want to do as a "hobby" Some do artwork, others do plushies. Custom blind bags...
<Kammerjunk> They shun the idea.
<Meanwhile> Are we going for something relevant to the game, or something for the site, or the show, or what?
<Reikim> kirz has implied that it's not related to the site.
<Reikim> If we put up a pony name, we'll be flooded with membership requests.
<kirzstryfe> would like to have [PONY] as the tag, but free from the site so not to discourage people from joining
<flutter_spin> heh Barbetos
<Shizuka> 13kirz only still has hop here because inertia is a property of matter
<Reikim> BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY sorry
<flutter_spin> Me? I like to write. I did fanfics for WoW, LotR, Star Wars...
<Moopy> umm........guys whos Tom?
<Canadian_Brony> Celes_Chere that ain't my style. I'm trying to get main ideas down in my head before I start typing, then I fill it in as I go along.
<flutter_spin> Tom is our little bot that tells how much longer for the next episode
<Meanwhile> So are we making the guild public? I assumed we'd just be using it as a sort of chat related affair.
<flutter_spin> you can also do the little code....
<cachi01|phone> !cd who are you?
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<flutter_spin> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<Ponies47> flutter_spin: Well I'm not much of a artist. I just do it when I'm bored I mean look my DA only ahs 4 postings :/
<Reikim> That was my assumption as well.
<cachi01|phone> Thats tom
<Canadian_Brony> I've seen him actually talk once.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> same
<Ponies47> *has
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'd still vote for Cool league of ponies
<Canadian_Brony> he has white text in a grey box
<cachi01|phone> Same here Ponies47
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> just for the joke
<Celes_Chere> Tomtom, who is tom?
<Meanwhile> The joke only you get.
<kirzstryfe> reason to have it semi-public would be to get bonuses faster
<cachi01|phone> Canadian_Brony holy shit really?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile probably
<Canadian_Brony> eeyup
<Moopy> yeah whos Tom?
<Reikim> Yeah, it's not a good joke if you're the only one laughing at it.
<cachi01|phone> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<flutter_spin> Ponies47: Sad to say, my family dislikes me being a brony. They don't do anything about it, just perhaps an evil look and maybe a word in here and there
<kirzstryfe> but review apps in some fashion, or keep herd-minds as a base rank to keep them under control
<cachi01|phone> ^ same here
<flutter_spin> My cousin and work kind of like it, seeing I wrote a fanfic
<Moopy> oh sorry tom didn't know you spoke
<Reikim> Hm
<cachi01|phone> !cd
<Tom> Next episode air time is unknown.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> soo everyone got EVA but no one got that one
<Meanwhile> Well, what's the purpose of the guild?
<Reikim> So, it'll be semi-public.
<Shizuka> 13oh now i see it
<cachi01|phone> :kickbot give me icecream
<Reikim> kirz has implied that there are bonuses involved.
<Canadian_Brony> not sure. He has a bot running, but it's only under his name cuz bots need a user. What he actually does . . . IDk. ask a mod
<Eulshy> theres no stream?
<Meanwhile> Oh right it's an abbreviation of clop.
*Eulshy Is sad
<Reikim> Also Shizu made an unconscious reference, haha.
<Moopy> time for a bronystate intermission time that my favorit
<Reikim> Oh wait
<Reikim> No
<cachi01|phone> What happens Eulshy?
<Ponies47> flutter_spin: WELL TO BAD! You like what you like if they can't handle it to bad! My mom likes me watching the show my dad is just meh and doesn't give a flying feather
<Shizuka> 13need a k...
<Reikim> I see it now
<Reikim> Dammit
<Celes_Chere> flutter_spin: Did you show them the charity work we do? Or do they find the idea of liking My Little Pony creepy?
<Reikim> Fffff
<flutter_spin> I actually... enjoy it. My brother has been EXTREMELY busy with the house and family. My friends all got married, had kids, moved away. I work part-time min wage and have loads of free time.
<Canadian_Brony> Party Quirks? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcSiCsapb3Q&feature=endscreen&NR=1
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat kick
<Meanwhile> Keeeeku.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> we need 3 more i think
<Reikim> Auto-kick. Refreshing.
<Eulshy> cachi01|phone, no stream..
<Meanwhile> Anyhoo, bonuses are nice but shouldn't the guild be for the sake of Bronystate shenanigans?
<flutter_spin> Celes_Chere: My mom has her... pet peeves. Not sure what it is about the show, but he hates guns & zombies
<Reikim> There would be shenanigans with or without a guild.
<Canadian_Brony> Eulshy watch Whose Line
<flutter_spin> she* :P I'm tired.
<cachi01|phone> But we have bill duffer the buffer guy!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile Shizuka kirzstryfe :D Join to the game!
<Shizuka> 13A Silly Union Killing All
<Meanwhile> Well yes but it's more convenient.
<Reikim> Oh haha Shizu
<Meanwhile> If we name it that Shizu I'm not joining.
<Eulshy> Canadian_Brony, whas that?
<Reikim> Hilariously that's appropriate for her :P
<Meanwhile> Your favourite characters best moment was being eaten by a flock of bird things.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> next time i'm making capital letters so people get it at the first try
<Canadian_Brony> Eulshy a very funny show which is comprised entirely of improv.
<Canadian_Brony> I'm linking skitttttt
<flutter_spin> No, she has been uber critical ever since I stopped giving her money
<Canadian_Brony> *skits
<Reikim> Asuka's best moment was in Rebuild when she was actually useful.
<Eulshy> Canadian_Brony, how does one watch it?
<Shizuka> 13and promptly had a bridge dropped on her
<Meanwhile> She's useful at some point?
<cachi01|phone> Eulshy youtube
<Canadian_Brony> Eulshy click on a link which I post.
<Reikim> Hey, she's coming back.
<flutter_spin> hey Eulshy
<Reikim> Didn't you see the trailers, Shizu?
<Eulshy> hewwo flutter_spin
<Canadian_Brony> v
<Canadian_Brony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5myJRlVA7s&feature=relmfu
<Moopy> hey im watching your link now
<Reikim> Getting crushed by a giant hand apparently gives badass points.
<Shizuka> 13yes
<Shizuka> 13still got a bridge dropped on her
<Meanwhile> I wouldn't really know of course, all I've seen of that show are bits of her being a douche and being thoroughly shredded.
<Canadian_Brony> it's also against Friends
<Reikim> Shizu, getting a bridge dropped on you means you die.
<Reikim> Out of the series.
<Canadian_Brony> some idiot put the two shows on at the same time
<SaxyPretender> 0,14see, the Rebuild movies are objectively good
<Meanwhile> Anyhoo, guilds made for the sake of having a guild don't tend to work well.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but when that scene happened
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I flipped out
<Reikim> What, Asuka getting crushed?
<Meanwhile> Guilds made for friends to have their own little funhouse do.
<Reikim> It was far better in Rebuild than the original.
<flutter_spin> hahaha. The skier. I love this one.
<Reikim> I mean, dammit that guy wasn't really all that important and I barely cared about him and now he's offed I mean what
<cachi01|phone> Guys G2G to sleep
<cachi01|phone> Cya!
<Canadian_Brony> g'night cachi01|phone
<dshannon> what's up
<Reikim> So, are we making a Bronystate guild?
<kirzstryfe> Cupcake Kitten Brigade [PONY]
<Canadian_Brony> hi dshannon. The sky, clouds, my roof, Luna~
<kirzstryfe> because how can you not command respect with a guild name like that?
<dshannon> nice
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Reikim> The only other purpose of a guild would be to amass an army of followers and thus gain power.
<Shizuka> 13Piles Of Noobs Yelling
<SaxyPretender> 0,14you could sell cookies
<Shizuka> 13oh wait that would still be too descriptive of bronystate..
<Reikim> Only Manechat.

<kirzstryfe> password for the TF2 game?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ponies
<Shizuka> 13phase's servers are all 'ponies'
<Reikim> Prickly Objects Necessitate Yelping?
<Shizuka> 13he still needs to name them
<Canadian_Brony> those were great
<Ponies47> Ok BRB restarting my computer this glitch is annoying the buck outta me -_-
<Moopy> Oh hey guys you want to see a machinama video link?
<kirzstryfe> haven't played MvM yet, so does it matter which class I pick, or just have fun? :)

<Canadian_Brony> Meanwhile was that an insult? Cuz I'm laughing at it.
<Eulshy> Shizuka es third fav mod
<Meanwhile> Was that the best you could come up with to try and deflect that accusation?
<Ponies47> Ohai Cipher :)

<Kammerjunk> Oh. Used to play on that server when I played WoW.
<Prick> what did i miss...
<Kammerjunk> Sweet dreams, Dovah.
<Meanwhile> Lok'tar ogar Buytoast.
<Canadian_Brony> my friend and I once played WoW. We had no bucking clue what we were doing at any point in the game. Our conversations were mainly composed of "What the fuck am I doing?" or "What the fuck are you doing?"
<Buytoast> yeah yeah orc orc orc and all that shit
<Kammerjunk> That's usually what I say when I try playing LoL.
<Moopy> im going to start lestining to the mods now
<Buytoast> even though i was a troll and not a smelly halfwit
<Canadian_Brony> we gave up after and hour and switched to TF2
<Shizuka> 13only now?
<Ponies47> The only game play I ever saw for WoW was becasue of that one South Park episode
<Buytoast> that wasn't gameplay
<Meanwhile> I played WoW for 5 years, stopped after Cata ended.
<Buytoast> what in the hell is that
<Buytoast> is that the new talent thing?
<Celes_Chere> Yup
<Kammerjunk> Stopped when TBC wasn't fun. And when Wrath wasn't fun. And when Cata wasn't fun.
<Eulshy> Wrek what level are you?
<Kammerjunk> Only good thing I've heard about MoP is that I don't have to farm TLPD again.
<Meanwhile> You played in TBC decided it wasn't for you but tried again in Wrath?
<Kammerjunk> Yup.
<Moopy> my mom actually let me play wow for my first time but she was telling me the little bit of the math stuff
<Meanwhile> That's just silly.
<Celes_Chere> Resilient and tranquil grip don't work together :/ that makes me a sad...panda
<Buytoast> maybe I'll get World of Warcraft: Pandaland
<Kammerjunk> What can I say, I'm easy to convince.
<Canadian_Brony> I'll stick to TF2. Then I'll actually know what I'm doing.
<Moopy> so much lag
<Meanwhile> Guess it's too late to complain about losing my spot.
<Kammerjunk> TF2 is fun, but so few people I know actually play it.
<Celes_Chere> I imagine the lag is mostly us
<Celes_Chere> but I vould be wrong
<Moopy> i play TF2 on the xbox
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03*
<Buytoast> disgusting
