<Reikim> Oh, you're talking about /those/ sorts of things.
<Bronysith> Dovah: all you did was call me ignorant and accused me of not playing the game, it was just a politician battle with no intellecutal gains, dont waste my time ever again
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> yes
<Dken2021> ello comrades
<Reikim> Sorry, overlooked those.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> no one cares about kinect
<Reikim> Mostly because personally I don't pay attention to them, sorry.
<Freefall29> Bronysith: hush. don't start something
<thelonepony> hi Comrade Dken2021
<Bronysith> hi Dken2021
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: could you repost that plz? my flash crashed as you posted it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> well i only look hardware and software wise
<Shizuka> 13http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/12/why_the_japan_china_island_dispute_is_an_american_problem
<twilight_sprinkle> thx
<AJIsAwesome> hi Dken2021 :)
<Reikim> Same here. I just tend to overlook stuff like Avatars/Miis.
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome yay he has the spanish rom :)
<Reikim> Yeah, Avatars were completely a copy of Wii's Miis. Possibly they might have been an upgrade, but who cares about them really?
<Dovah> eh well no worrys i found it quite fun and even won a few games of chess :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> xbox > failed to add wi-fi > avatars > better store
<twilight_sprinkle> flutter_spin: i still think its an awesome site, they have tons of cool stuff like the drawfriends and animations and such
<flutter_spin> But the reason why my fanfic is obviously flawed: 1st person, self-insert, original character, similiar color/name/preferences as Twilight Sparkle, meets mane 6, doesn't have a cutie mark.
<CCCP> Hi Dken2021
<Reikim> Better Store? As i- Yeah I'll give you that.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Agreed.
<flutter_spin> But I love every bit of it.
<cachi01|phone> Cutie marks are too.mainstream
<DerpyMuffins> The rules for submiting a story now is kinda stupid
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and well same goes for sony who did add the wifi and better graphics
<Freefall29> DerpyMuffins: what are the rules
<Dken2021> flutterchu oh ,your fic didn't get get that much praise?
<Reikim> All ze graphics everywhere
<Reikim> I will contest, however
<twilight_sprinkle> Dken2021: le misping
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> they outright copy the first one and upgrade everything it have
<Dken2021> d'oh
<DerpyMuffins> No and I quote "X-rated content, including sexually transgressive or gorey stories"
<Reikim> Perhaps from a software standpoint.
<flutterchu> Dken2021: i didnt finish a fanfic what are you talking about
<flutter_spin> Dken2021: Naw. I threw it up and people didn't care for it. I revised it, but still nothing.
<Reikim> I have a feeling that Sony was doing their own thing, though. However I can't back this up having never touched a single Sony product other than my PSP
<Kandarihu> We're gonna get in a lot of trouble whether we honor our agreement or not... especially if Romney is present by the time this war goes hot.
<Reikim> (which I adore due to cracking shenanigans and Dissidia)
<Dken2021> DerpyMuffins is that only one of the rules?
<cachi01|phone> And now we talkin bout war
<Reikim> About graphics, though.
<Cynder7> 6I have 11482 favourites on dA.. o.0
<DerpyMuffins> There is a few more
<Cades> :O
<Cades> thats alot :P
<CCCP> Did you hear about that American ambassador?
<DerpyMuffins> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/01/story-submission-guidelines.html
<Reikim> I feel obligated to mention that, despite the graphics limitation, some of the most artistically beautiful games are on the Wii.
<Cynder7> 6Yeah xD
<Shizuka> 13was the ambassador the eve player or was that a different diplomat?
<Reikim> PS3 has some too, but they aren't games that use the graphics engine for its intended purpose (playing Crysis)
<Reikim> ^ Joke
<Shizuka> 13saw a bunch of reddit threads about how eve online has come to a halt for a memorial, really nice
<Cynder7> 6It's 3 years worth of favs but it still seems like too many :P
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Flootahshy> HAY GUYS
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6de_DXS4z4 watch dis
<Reikim> Heck, even the 360 had beautiful artistic games.
<Dken2021> hallo Flootahshy
<Reikim> Actually
<Freefall29> sup Flootahshy
<Shizuka> 13note to self
<Reikim> Fuck everything I've said before
<Shizuka> 13english needs syntax highlighting
<flutter_spin> DerpyMuffins: lol you beat me. I was checking out the japan-china story thing
<thelonepony> hi Flootahshy
<AJIsAwesome> hi Flootahshy :)
<Flootahshy> Why is the chat dead?
<Reikim> I'm happy that more art games are happening.
<Reikim> Syntax highlighting?
<flutter_spin> Flootahshy: no stream
<Freefall29> its like 10:25PM and I should be going to be.... naw screw it! ponies are worth it.
<AJIsAwesome> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RSF7Z8nGwQ&feature=BFa&list=FL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ
<Shizuka> 13been reading C source most of the day...
<Cades> One does not simply have too many favorites
<Shizuka> 13huge block of chat text without colors is making my eyes blurry..
<Cynder7> 6xDDD
<Flootahshy> flutter_spin: What are you talking about? The Buffer Show is a GREAT show!
<Reikim> We would use colours, but we'd get kicked for it.
<Freefall29> AJIsAwesome: my childhood... so awesome.
<Reikim> Silly, don't lament your own rules.
<DerpyMuffins> Ok I might have a chance of getting on EqD
<flutter_spin> AJIsAwesome: I always thought about that. I don't like freeform jazz. I don't like freeform anything. Just noise.
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT 5 i dunno i don't think it has been fix so far
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nope
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome dat spongebob scene :D
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> here comes the kick
<Shizuka> 13forget who's running color kicks but ja ctcps still aren't checked
<Reikim> Anyway, Trix...what I'm saying is, I prefer games like Masamune that have an "artsy" style.
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: That's alright. That's your opinion, and I'm going to let you have it. :)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim i liked okami
<Reikim> Or Okami.
<Cynder7> 6Kinda wish I hadn't eaten those cookies 4 hours ago..
<Reikim> Okami is a damn beautiful game.
<cachi01|phone> flutter_spin according to spongebob we must appreciate it to become a man!
<flutter_spin> But yeah, none of my stories (http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&user=30937) will ever reach EQD
<Cades> Why?
<Cynder7> 6Brb..need to find something to eat.. ._.
<Reikim> I'm sick of the market's massive bias towards "realistic" graphics.
<Cades> haha k
<Cynder7> 6Cause I'm hungry and there isn't much atm xD
<Bronysith> flutter_spin: they didnt even read one paragraph of my fic
<Reikim> But that's just me.
<Cynder7> 6:O Noodles..k,brb xD
<Dken2021> flutter_spin never know man
<Phase4> TheGreatAndPowerfulT, that has been fixed, but neither of the people with the kickbot are here
<Flootahshy> flutter_spin: All these made by you?
<flutter_spin> Bronysith: yeah. I think they read the first chapter and stopped. I think I remember you saying that before too.
<Freefall29> Bronysith: your fic was actully cool.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> k
<cachi01|phone> Bronysith Really? But its a fuckin awesome fic
<Bronysith> flutter_spin: they read one sentence man
<Reikim> Does BP do that?
<Phase4> Reikim, not yet because lazy
<Bronysith> flutter_spin: "oh another star wars fic" didnt even give it a fair shot
<flutter_spin> Flootahshy: yeah. I'm still working on 2 more fics. One is 2,000 words so far (one shot) and the other highlights Su... a Bronystate mod (10,000 words in so far)
<Cades> mmmmm
<cachi01|phone> DAFUQ DAFUQ DAFUQ DAFUQ DAFUQ WHATS WITH FIMFICTION PIC
<Dovah> Bronysith: what is the name of it, sounds like it might be interesting
<Flootahshy> flutter_spin: Reading one. As of now.
<Reikim> Anyway
<Reikim> I'll be fair with all consoles.
<Reikim> I don't think any console is "better" than another.
<cachi01|phone> Weeeird... I just saw an Aj x rarity pic.in fimfiction
<Flootahshy> I WANT THAT PICTURE
<Freefall29> I don't get it. Bronysith's fic was awesome, it gets rejected. A decent fic like my little dashie comes around, its hailed as the greatest piece of literature even written.
<Reikim> It's the devs and the publishers that make the difference.
<Phase4> a console is a tool
<flutter_spin> Oh Bronysith worked hard on his fics. I still have a hard time reading other fics, though.
<Reikim> It's how they are used.
<DerpyMuffins> Well its turns out my fiction is more original than I thought it was and the EqD is gonna get back to me
<Phase4> ^
<Reikim> For example, the PS3.
<Bronysith> Freefall29: my fic wasnt that great man, stop kissing ass
<cachi01|phone> Flootashy just refresh till u get the pic
<Reikim> It started off badly because nobody could figure out the processor system.
<Reikim> Then it got better.
<flutter_spin> cachi01|phone: oh yeah. Fimfiction has new ... shipping banners
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6de_DXS4z4 <- this
<Flootahshy> cachi01|phone: No, the Pinkie/RD pic.
<Reikim> Then the entire market got flooded with FPS clones.
<Phase4> bad game companys can produce crap on any console
<cachi01|phone> WUT
<cachi01|phone> DAFUQ
<flutter_spin> You can scroll through all of them.
<Bronysith> Freefall29: one day you say, not good, next day it is amazing, then 3rd day not good then 4th day it is amazing
*cachi01|phone refreshes fimfiction
<Reikim> Then graphics became more important than gameplay.
<Reikim> But now...
<Shizuka> 13speaking of, i get the sense chat's had enough mvm stream for a while
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: It's funny. You want to get featured on Fim Fiction, just put shipping into one of your fics.
<flutter_spin> A couple friends of mine on Fimfiction have agreed that the site has gone downhill. They really don't have standards much anymore.
<Shizuka> 13unless someone else goes, i might stream, but at a loss as to what..
<Reikim> We've also got gems like The Last of Us coming out.
<Shizuka> 13unless i did day after tomorrow rifftrax tonight
<Freefall29> Bronysith: I really can't decide if I like it or hate it. the hype was just getting to me.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka stream guns of icarus :p
<Reikim> I still have not gotten over that one...
<Reikim> Yes
<Shizuka> 13don't have that..
<Reikim> I'm looking for an excuse to play- dammit
<Dken2021> is it me, or is fimfiction actually supports shipping?
<Shizuka> 13oh that was the beta thing
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome ikr lol
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i gave you a key
<Shizuka> 13still don't have it
<cachi01|phone> And dat RD x PP is cute
<Reikim> Trix gave you a key...
<Bronysith> Dken2021: shipping and love stories in general
<Bronysith> and sex
<Bronysith> lots of sex stories
<cachi01|phone> lots of se
*Shizuka 13checks log
<cachi01|phone> Dammit ninja'd
<Cynder7> 6Back.. ^^
<flutter_spin> Fimfiction supports? ... Fimfiction doesn't care if you have gore, etc in your fics.. as long as you tag them.
<Shizuka> 13wasn't this month was it
<flutter_spin> The only thing they care is if there are ponies from the show and it isn't a metafic
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> around2 weeks i think
<Reikim> Oh, Trix
<cachi01|phone> or My inmortal..... Pony version.....
<Reikim> About system copying.
<Cynder7> 6Now I just have to turn off the beeping thing as soon as possible so my mom doesn't wake up.. ^^
<Reikim> I finally got my research links open...
<Shizuka> 13would have been august then, PMs are purged at the end of the month on my system
<Bronysith> flutter_spin: and dont forget, if there is a human in there then it is a no no according to EQD
<Reikim> Yeah, they copied off one another, but only in software.
<Dken2021> heh, the things they let you get away with these days.....
<Bronysith> just because my OC was human then became a pony it is automatically bad
<Bronysith> fuck you EQD
<flutter_spin> I have a lot of work to do for my fics, but I've slowed down a lot. I'm being careful with my writing style.
<Bronysith> and go fuck your electric sockets
<Reikim> The base systems, as they were released, could not have been clones. They were too close together.
<Shizuka> 13could l4d1 some more.. haven't streamed blood harvest recently
<flutter_spin> whoa.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i don't delete my keys until sure
<Reikim> Hm
<cachi01|phone> Electick sockets lolwut
<Reikim> We still haven't played Alien Swarm, have we?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't think so
<Dken2021> Bronysith take in mind, that the staff has probably seen those fics a thousand times
<Reikim> We should do that.
<cachi01|phone> electric*
<Shizuka> 13alien swarm was kind of... eh..
<Bronysith> Dken2021: so? that doesnt give them an excuse to not read the whole thing and give i t a fair opionon
<DerpyMuffins> Anyone seen Reikim anywhere?
<flutter_spin> Hey, when I posted my fic... I never knew about the whole 1 fic per 5minutes
<Reikim> It's fun with friends.
<Shizuka> 13may have just been the people we got stuck with but i didn't find it particularly interesting :/
<Ponies47> DerpyMuffins: Nope
<flutter_spin> or is it 10minutes, whatever
<Cades> lol
<Bronysith> Dken2021: they are like "oh human right" toss into garbage
<Reikim> It's more fun when you have good people.
<Reikim> I spent a solid three hours on it once with a friend.
<Bronysith> Dken2021: they literally judge stories by teh covers
<DerpyMuffins> Its one of their rules
<Cades> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7Hiqa8ainU&feature=plcp
<Reikim> Part of the problem was there were only two of us, but eh.
<DarkStratos> no stream?
<Cades> what do you think about it so far?
<Reikim> Is otakon in chat?
<Freefall29> Dark92Enigma: nope.avi
<DerpyMuffins> No human fanfics
<AJIsAwesome> no
<Reikim> Damn, no
<Dken2021> ello DarkStratos, doesn't seem like it
<Reikim> He would have been hilarious.
<DarkStratos> aw
<cachi01|phone> "holy shit this is amazi- oh wait. Human" *drops it to trash*
<Bronysith> well i have to call an airstrike on jersey
<Dken2021> but it's fine, we're still here
<Bronysith> cachi01|phone: exactly
<Buytoast> Are you people talking about Equestria Daily now?
<Reikim> Ooooh
<Reikim> Shizuka, have you played Dear Esther?
<Shizuka> 13the original
<flutter_spin> I read "Drocsid" (the more completed fic) to my cousin. He liked it. My boss read the first chapter of it. He was blown away.
<DerpyMuffins> BC I had them wish me luck with my fic
<Reikim> Chat might like that one.
<Shizuka> 13followed the remake development up until he disappeared to make it a $10 mod
<AJIsAwesome> yep.
<Reikim> Yeah, that sucked.
<twilight_sprinkle> If EQD doesnt want to post human fics, then theres probably a reason for it, and its still an awesome site. Its like a capital city of the fandom. I wont complain if they change something because its like complaining that someone gave you 200 bucks and then asked 50 back.
<flutter_spin> When people who don't know about writing or the community read my fics, they like it.
<cachi01|phone> Drocsid........ Thats celestia backwards right?
<Reikim> I got the original a while ago. Fun little one-hour game.
<Reikim> Mind screwy.
<Shizuka> 13the original had some major sound problems for me
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Agreed.
<Reikim> Hm?
<Cades> he hates ignitus O_O
<God_the_Atheist> why would celestia have a d in it
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: Yes. :P
<flutter_spin> cachi01|phone: You have to say something about it everytime, eh?
<Shizuka> 13like the narration worked but the music was way choppy
<Bronysith> cachi01|phone: fucking really?
<Shizuka> 13sounded awful
<Dken2021> flutter_spin hehe, clever naming
<Reikim> Never experienced that.
<Reikim> I did manage to break the game though by going places I wasn't supposed to.
<flutter_spin> Dken2021: Took me 3 weeks to come up with
<DerpyMuffins> You never notice that Dken?
<cachi01|phone> celestiad
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim did you check " To the moon" ?
<Buytoast> Ah, Equestria Daily. Who knew a man who jacks it to dragons and a blue pompous asshole could lead such a thing.
<Reikim> Right, not that then.
<Reikim> Stanley Parable?
<cachi01|phone> flutter_spin everytime huh?
<Shizuka> 13could do stanley again
<Shizuka> 13encore of my first stream
<twilight_sprinkle> Buytoast: do you even know him?
<Dken2021> DerpyMuffins about as creative as Cinos
<Reikim> Done all the routes yet?
<Shizuka> 13oh yes
<cachi01|phone> BLONIC
<Shizuka> 13my first stream was 45 minutes, all endinggs
<flutter_spin> cachi01|phone: uhhh, I recall 4 times. I may have linked it more than that here.
<Reikim> Oh my
<Bronysith> i dont feel like talking about the lameness in EQDs fanfiction policies
<Reikim> Quite the nostalgia trip then.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> cool Bayonetta 2 is coming out...exclusive to Wii U
<Shizuka> 13waaaay back in february
<Bronysith> im goign for a very enthusiastic walk
<cachi01|phone> Ikr
<cachi01|phone> Fucking 349 dollars i dont have
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: I"M NOT JOHNNY QUEST! I'M MY ORIGINAL CHARACTER, JOHNNY TEST!
<Shizuka> 13freespace and darwinia are still on the FINISH STREAMING ME shelf but i'm not much up for them..
<Buytoast> You can getthe 299 one you know
<DerpyMuffins> EqD isnt that bad. They must have put a ban on human fanfics for a reason
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Still better than not getting it at all.
<cachi01|phone> AND IM.NOT SCOOBY DOO. IM MY ORIGINAL CHARACTER DUKE
<Bronysith> night all
<Freefall29> bye bronysith
<AJIsAwesome> night Bronysith :)
<Dken2021> seeya Bronysith
<Reikim> I started the Stanley Parable with the "blow everything up" ending.
<cachi01|phone> night Bronysith
<flutter_spin> I just wish I would have some proof-readers. Everybody I talk to is like me - "I write, but I don't read"
<thelonepony> bye Bronysith
<DerpyMuffins> Cya Bronysith
<Buytoast> wait, they actually flat out put a ban on human stories there now?
<Reikim> I panicked pretty hard when everything became hopeless.
<flutter_spin> Buytoast: pretty much
<Cynder7> 6Back
<DerpyMuffins> Yup
<AJIsAwesome> yup
<Buytoast> ahaha
<Freefall29> what's wrong with human fics
<Cades> front
<DerpyMuffins> Dont you read teh memos?
<flutter_spin> Buytoast: that also goes for "a brony in equestria" even if they are turned into a pony
<Buytoast> better not defile seth's precious trixie by making it human
<God_the_Atheist> I LIKE PIE
<Dken2021> I guess since they've seen so much of it, they get tired of seeing another one
<Dovah> flutter_spin: i read, but i dont write, much :P
<Shizuka> 13you heard there's a remake of that coming ja?
<Reikim> Anyway, if you still have the beta key for GoI
<Reikim> Remake?
<Shizuka> 13it's on greenlight
<AJIsAwesome> Probably because the ones usually sent in before were not well developed fics or just plain terrible ones.
<flutter_spin> Dovah: It's two-fold. I want people to read my fics, but if they don't - I understand.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> key is not working for some reason
*Ponies47 Throws himself across the chat
<Reikim> (awkward moment when two people type something in at the same time)
<DerpyMuffins> Well Im doing pretty good for a first time writer
<Shizuka> 13coming up fast now that black mesa is ready
*AJIsAwesome catches Ponies47
<Reikim> Wait
<Reikim> Black Mesa is ready?
<flutter_spin> I just like the references to the bronystate moderators in my fics
<Shizuka> 13http://blackmesasource.com/
<Shizuka> 1312 hours
<Reikim> ...
*Reikim flips
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: I was trying to fly! D:
<Shizuka> 13so at the least
<Phase4> the datacenter that berry is in is still broken
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: But nice catch :P
*Reikim flips Trixie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh yeah must re-install half life
<Shizuka> 13the NEXT time i stream i'll be doing that
*Reikim flips Shizu
<Dken2021> wait, is there such a rule for a pony in the real world?
<Dovah> flutter_spin: i'd read them, eventualy :P i procrastinate like a boss
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: But you can't fly. :( Also, thanks. :$
<flutter_spin> "Moon Time" might not be fleshed out, but Wr.... a special artist is in there
*Shizuka 13is upside down .-.
<Reikim> And it's free, isn't it?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> it's
<DerpyMuffins> EqD likes my sotry. They didnt even give me a strike for submiting it for the first time
<Reikim> I can finally play Half-Life.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is not complete
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: What story was it?
<DerpyMuffins> My fanfic remember....
<flutter_spin> cool. I watch EqD in non-fanfiction mode
<Reikim> It releases in twelve hours.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> is just until what chapter was it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i forgot
<flutter_spin> I think they want a link DerpyMuffins
<Reikim> And they completely redid the soundtrack.
<DerpyMuffins> To?
<Reikim> You know what, the people who did this? They're just awesome.
*flutter_spin laughs
<AJIsAwesome> The fic.
<Reikim> I worship these people as demigods.
<Reikim> Seven years? Dedication.
<flutter_spin> I guess I'm not the only one having an odd day
*Dovah takes Derpm muffins and muffins derpy
<Dovah> DerpyMuffins: *

<DerpyMuffins> I still need a way to get the Mare 6 into it
<Shizuka> 13attention ponies
<Shizuka> 13in 12 hours
<Reikim> Mm? Coding what?
<Shizuka> 13black mesa source releases
<Shizuka> 13which happens to be 8:47am mountain time
*Dovah is now stalking flutter_spin and DerpyMuffins on fimfiction
<Dken2021> neato
<Shizuka> 13also known as the time gordon freeman enters the test chamber
<flutter_spin> I like stalkers!
<Dovah> Shizuka: :O
<cachi01|phone> Lol theres a fic about twilight being an MLG
<Shizuka> 13C
<Shizuka> 13the hard way
<Freefall29> Shizuka: this game is gonna kick ass
<Shizuka> 13(so it says)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> well theyre more like skin ideas like Pyro head is brain in a jar,etc. :$
<Reikim> So just doing practice then?
<Shizuka> 13basically
<Reikim> Does it at least give you practice problems?

<AJIsAwesome> Anyone like Christopher Walken? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giAQuLntqXY&feature=BFa&list=FL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ

<Shizuka> 13am up to ex19 which is shoehorning objects into C
<Reikim> Oh yey it's free!
<AJIsAwesome> JESmith71: :D
<Cynder7> 6Looks pretty good! :O
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Discord being Discord
<Reikim> Objects in C...I thought there was a way of doing that already?
<Reikim> Or was that C++?
<Cynder7> 6xD
<Freefall29> I'm gonna go to bed everypony. bye
<Dken2021> laters Freefall29
<DerpyMuffins> Cya Freefall29
<Cynder7> 6That was the Chronicler Ignitus,right?
<Cades> yeah
<flutter_spin> flutterchu: I have no idea, but that reminded me of: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv4E9175EOY
<cachi01|phone> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOEmwC6zfXo&feature=youtube_gdata_player
<Shizuka> 13C++ does objects, C is too dumb to get it
<PinkiePry> Does anypony think Valve is gonna make another Portal? (I wub Portal :3)
<Reikim> Blargh
<Reikim> Why bother learning it then?
<Shizuka> 13i kind of stopped five lectures into the stanford programming paradigms videos cause i was getting too confused by pointers and stuff
<Shizuka> 13so i'm learning up from bare metal :3
<PinkiePry> Does anypony think Valve is gonna release another Portal? (I wub Portal :3)
<Dken2021> who knows?
<Kandarihu> Well, I'm going to be without my mom's laptop at that time.
<flutter_spin> JESmith71: they look like dogs
<CCCP-> Uh uh
<Reikim> I know there's still a lot out there that's programmed in C, but I thought it was being all phased out in favour of C++?
<Shizuka> 13you can do C in C++, though i think there's a couple things you're supposed to change
<Reikim> When I tried both I found C++...easier? More fluid? More elegant?
<AJIsAwesome> I'm fine with the ending given in Portal 2, IMO.
<Reikim> Elegant's probably a good word.
<Shizuka> 13but otherwise C is still huge because there's compilers for it on practically everything
<Phase4> c++ confuses me
<Shizuka> 13you could compile C on toast i'm sure
<Shizuka> 13not the toaster, the toast
<cachi01|phone> PinkiePry the prequel without portals they were planning to do maybe
<Reikim> Could say the same baout Java.
<Reikim> *about
<Phase4> i meen clases are simple enough, but refference types? streams?
<PinkiePry> ah
<Kandarihu> Portal 0?
<Dovah> Night everypony
<cachi01|phone> Yeah
<Phase4> its bizare
<AJIsAwesome> night Dovah :)
<cachi01|phone> Night Dovah
<Dken2021> seeyas Dovah
<Reikim> I love classes.
<Shizuka> 13streams get into how unix does stuff i think
<Shizuka> 13how everything is a file
<Reikim> Classes are happiness for me, having done what little program I have.
<Reikim> *programming
<Dovah> yes it is night time, that is what i just said :D
<Cades> that moment when one of your favorite artists uploads the first tune in 3 months :P
<thelonepony> night Dovah
<RaveBrony> God bless you coding people..... I felt like my brain was melting in my java class yesterday :(
<Dovah> lol jk
<Shizuka> 13my programming started in autoit which also didn't understand objects... so i forced it to
<Shizuka> 13with a four dimensional array
<Dovah> but really i need sleeps
*Reikim is not a coding person, merely knowledgeable enough to pretend he knows what he's talking about
<JESmith71> flutter_spin: Are you talking about Celestia and Luna without their manes?
<flutter_spin> I've been out of it all day. I took a nap and snapped out of bed thinking "My alarm didn't go off! I'm late!" and running out the door I said "Wait, its 6PM"
<flutter_spin> JESmith71: yes
<Reikim> ...Actually I could apply that statement to everything I say.
<Reikim> I think I disappoint people a lot.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm seeing if i can get another key btw
<Nittany_Discord> I'm off to bed for tonight.
<AJIsAwesome> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY1j5Ultpq8&feature=BFa&list=FL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ
<Reikim> "Oh my god you're so intelligent!" "Actually I was bullshitting you, sorry."
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Nittany_Discord! Get some rest! :)
<flutter_spin> I played some Starcraft 2, but I kept running into idiots. One person asked when Heart of the Swarm patch was coming. He snapped when I told him he had to buy it.
<Reikim> Says a little something about the gullibility of the average person.
<Dark92Enigma> Goodnight Nittany_Discord !
<Dken2021> seeya nitty
<DerpyMuffins> Cya Nittany_Discord
<thelonepony> bye Nittany_Discord
<Ponies47> Bye Nittany_Discord
<PinkiePry> I really picture a new portal as a more open world style. I'm not saying rpg or anything, but maybe use of a portal gun on the outside world. That would be fun
<cachi01|phone> Cya Nittany_Discord
<flutter_spin> ~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbE9-3s7qvo classic.
<CK|Catnap> ....people seriously didn't know that the Starcraft expansions would need to be purchased?
<CK|Catnap> How can you be that dumb? ._.
<flutter_spin> CK|Catnap: I know.
<cachi01|phone> Pinkiepry i would rather ask for the prequel
<MASF123> Hey everyone I just walked in and I not- O_O The NewSuperBronyU?!?!
<Dken2021> PinkiePry too bad that none of the surfaces in the open world are made of moondust
<Reikim> I'm liking this book, Shizu.
<Reikim> The author has a personality. I'm not falling asleep.
<Shizuka> 13http://hg.vortalcord.net/learnc/src can look at the hideous results too :3
<cachi01|phone> NewSuperBronyU Y U ONLY HAVE 8 GB
<flutter_spin> But I love play 3v3VH AI on Starcraft 2. The new players really stand out.
<cachi01|phone> i dont have 349 dollars to get the 32 GB one :(
<PinkiePry> I thought that maybe they would make something like a portable container of moondust? I'm a silly fillie. XD And to cachi, if they did a prequel I would want to find out why Chell is deaf.
<cachi01|phone> deaf?
<AJIsAwesome> Chell's deaf?
<cachi01|phone> She aint deaf
<Ponies47> Still no stream? O.O
<PinkiePry> sorry, mute
<Dark92Enigma> By the way......i'm trying to get into the survey.......but it won't let me sign in with my e-mail
<Dken2021> do you mean mute?
<PinkiePry> yeah
<AJIsAwesome> PinkiePry: Oh.
<PinkiePry> my bad :$
<AJIsAwesome> No prob.
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Try using the home page of the site.
<Dark92Enigma> Ok
<MASF123> I played TF2 for the 1st time on PC
<Dken2021> how was it?
<Reikim> ...Well the Hello World isn't hideous.
<flutter_spin> Guild Wars 2 sells 2 million copies in first 2 weeks. That's cool.
<flutter_spin> I knew the headstart at around 400,000
<cachi01|phone> OctoG123 is best pony
<AJIsAwesome> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYAGB11YrSs&feature=BFa&list=FL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ
<Reikim> Also: MFW I realize I've actually doen some of these.
<RaveBrony> Time for sleep!! Goodnight, Bronystate! Take care! :)
<flutter_spin> AJIsAwesome: that clip. Sadly, I can't say that around work. They think I say something else.
<Shizuka> 13he might be grabbing some from K&R, dunno
<AJIsAwesome> Night RaveBrony :)
<Shizuka> 13i have some version of the K&R bible here but never dove in
<thelonepony> night RaveBrony :)
<DerpyMuffins> Cya RavenBrony
<MASF123> Dken2021, it was great
<cachi01|phone> Night RaveBrony :)
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: Is it what I think it is?
<Shizuka> 13OOOOOOOOOOOOLD
<Shizuka> 13seriously eqd keep up with reddit
<Kinixys> Thank you for the links AJIsAwesome
<Reikim> I blame Seth.
<Reikim> Why? Because why not.
<AJIsAwesome> Kinixys: No prob
<flutter_spin> well I've always kind of had a problem with speech. I'm also quiet (like Fluttershy).
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol half of the things they post i already see them
<flutter_spin> So my 'th' may come out as 'f' and my 'v' come out as 'b'
<Reikim> So I got lost around Excercise 7
<AJIsAwesome> Who wants some Castlevania music? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmyK3FdTu_Q&feature=BFa&list=FL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and that makes me sad
<cachi01|phone> MEMEMEMMEMEMEME I WANT
<Dken2021> ooh, sweet
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0TqVaEMlgI Italian Fluttershy is the cutest thing ever
<Dken2021> though I prefer Julius's theme
<otakon> HEY GUYS!
<Reikim> I think it's partially because of the Netvvork fiasco.
<otakon> Anyone see the new TFS video yet?
<AJIsAwesome> Hi otakon. :)
<otakon> It's pretty funny if short
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: TFS?
<Reikim> They might be checking what they get more thoroughly now.
<thelonepony> HI otakon :)
<CCCP> It's hot :(
<otakon> Team Four Star
<Dken2021> yup saw it, it was ok
<Reikim> Plus they have to wade through, what, several thousand e-mails a day?
<Dken2021> and hello there otakon
<AJIsAwesome> Team Four Star? Never heard of it. :$
<CCCP> Hi otakon
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: O_o
<Reikim> Still, they could at least employ people just to watch these specific things...
<otakon> hiya Dken2021 and CCCP
<MASF123> DBZ Abridged
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: GO LOOK IT UP NOW DAMMIT
<Klumzeedragon> MASF123: :P
<flutter_spin> lol otakon
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: NOW! and LAUGH YOUR ASS OFF
<Ponies47> Dat otakon
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: meh, season 2 was good, but season 1 was pretty dull
<Reikim> Arrays are fairly understandable.
<Dken2021> "let go of my food, my friend, my emergency food, and my son, all in that order"
<Shizuka> 13i think i had help from the paradigms videos and from doing hack on understanding pointers/arrays
<flutter_spin> I don't know why I bother going to the Minecraft Middle-Earth server. People freak out when I tell them I never read the books.
<otakon> Dken2021: "I'll see you in Space Hell, cousin Jeice..."
<Dken2021> books of?
<Reikim> One thing I really hate about C? Using backslash.
<flutter_spin> Lord of the Rings
<otakon> flutter_spin: YOU ARE ON A SERVER DEDICATED TO THE FICTION
<Reikim> Such a completely unnatural motion for me.
<otakon> flutter_spin: KNOWING the fiction before hand is kind of expected
<flutter_spin> otakon: lol. I know! To make things even funnier, one of the main guys on the server is named "Eeyup"
<flutter_spin> Yes, they take MLP seriously over there
<Shizuka> 13been doing all my work in vim so far... esc is throwing me off more than everything else
<cachi01|phone> AjIsAwesome are you AjTheMightygamee in youtube?
<flutterchu> Matt's doing somthing stupid isnt he/HELLO EVERYONE I GOT A NEW KEYBOARED
<cachi01|phone> Gamer*
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01|phone: Nope. :D
<otakon> hiya flutterchu
<Reikim> vim...compiler?
<cachi01|phone> Oh lol

<flutterchu> flutter_spin: no i just say a line from some show or book when i enter and say hello this one was from eddsworld
<Ponies47|Shower> BRB shower
<flutter_spin> oh yeah. Eddsworld. I've only seen a couple flics
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT is still trying to undestand phyton
<Reikim> I thought Python was THE noob language.
*Israphel deep bass tone
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> started with c then java
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> never worked with console until now
<flutterchu> can anyone hear me?
<Cynder7> 6:3
*Israphel stares at flutterchu with glowing red eyes
<Reikim> Don't worry, I've never worked with it period.
<thelonepony> fucking internet
<AJIsAwesome> Who misses E102 Gamma? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2sOpyF1nF4&feature=BFa&list=FL5QyBGi4t1uDa0FwakXNeYQ
<Reikim> About the only thing I'm any good with is Visual Basic, and that barely even qualifies as a language anymore.
<Shizuka> 13vim's a text editor
<oni_link> aw i do AJIsAwesome
<Shizuka> 13locked in an eternal holy war with emacs
<Dark92Enigma> To any mod available: I tried to access the survey for the lottery, i write my name, last name, and then i go for the e-mail. IT'S ALL DOWNHILL from there......the page says: ''the e-mail you used is already registered'' WTF??? Do i have to make a new e-mail or something? And YES i tried from the homepage, but same result.......can any(mod)pony help me? :(
<Reikim> Do their clashes sear the land with divine flame and scar it eternally with the brands of the gods?
<cachi01|phone> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjK-LzkekCU&feature=youtube_gdata_player LOL
<flutter_spin> WHY? Why Eddsworld!? Why did you have to make that PMV to Yaplap of Fluttershy? Freaked me out!
<Shizuka> 13that's part of this book, you do stuff at the command line, no IDE or fancy schmancy abstractions between you and bare metal
<Shizuka> 13just about
<Israphel> That'sssss a very niccccceee email you have there...
<Shizuka> 13consider vi vs emacs has been going on since the 70s
<AJIsAwesome> ohai Israphel :)
<flutterchu> i just realized somthing
<oni_link> Famitracker, WHY YOU MAKE SUCH BIG WAV FILES ??? :[
<Dark92Enigma> Herbert reference much?
<flutter_spin> oh. He didn't make it. He just faved it. Well.. same thing
<Shizuka> 13i think emacs runs on "we can do more than text edit" while vi runs on "we only text edit, but we do it well!"
<Shizuka> 13vim is an enhanced fork of vi, i like it cause for plain editing you don't have to dig too far in
<oni_link> Im happy, I finally finished an original 8 bit piece :)
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: I was going to say. I don't remember them making that.
<cachi01|phone> Can we hear it oni_link?
<flutter_spin> It was on the main page. The UI is weird.
<cachi01|phone> or see it or wutever lul
<AJIsAwesome> flutter_spin: You mean Featured?
<flutter_spin> I'm trying to dig up what I remember from Eddsworld
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> Bookmarking this for now and going back to my writing.
<flutter_spin> No. My brother works for newgrounds and I remember seeing his stuff on the site
<oni_link> cachi01|phone: be warned, this thing is a whopping 19.6 MB

<Shizuka> 13:3
<Reikim> Or rather, fixing other people's writing.
<Israphel> Terminator 3: Skynet needs more money, and to screw up a perfectly good cannon ending to the two-movie series.
<Reikim> Every tense shift I see makes me want to stab something.
<oni_link> Also, its loud guys sorry to tell you a bit late :P
<flutter_spin> its going to kill me unless I figure out the exact video
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i love when devs support their game :3
<PinkiePry> Does anypony know a good zombie movie? I've watched all romero ones.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> asked for 1 key got sent 4 :3
<cachi01|phone> 19 MB HOLY SHIT O_O
<AJIsAwesome> Did anyone here know that A Christmas Tale is getting a sequel and a lot of people massively disliked its trailer?
<thelonepony> shuan of the dead?
<flutter_spin> THATS IT! http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/382765 "Sugar, Sugar"
<oni_link> cachi01|phone: I told you :/
<Reikim> Should've bugged you for one rather than buying the game.
<AJIsAwesome> I think that's the title.
<Cades> You should make a video telling spyro fans to come here. I can't make one cuz of my stupid computer -_-
<PinkiePry> Seen it
<flutter_spin> wait, I can link newgrounds right?
<Shizuka> 13the ball was thrown by shizu
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i remember giving you one
<otakon> yes
<otakon> as long as it's not NSFW ofc

<flutter_spin> heh. Rose's older sounding voice didn't do it for me. Now Junebug. Junebug's voice is awesome.
<Reikim> Thank you for understanding the English language.
<oni_link> cachi01|phone: I really love the way the ending came out :3
<otakon> JESmith71: NO NO NO NO NO WHO THOUGHT A SEQUEL FOR A CHRISTMAS STORY WAS A GOOD IDEA?
<Reikim> My issue is with things like this:
<otakon> FOR CHRIST'S SAKE LEAVE IT ALONE
<otakon> DO NOT MAKE A GODDAMN SEQUEL!
<Reikim> "It has only been a few days since Nightmare Night, but Luna still remembered it like it had happened only a mere few hours ago"
<Shizuka> 13mere few
<Dken2021|FireEmblem> a sequel for a christmas special? how absurd
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I HAVE N IDEA. The trailer on Youtube has a MASSIVE AMOUNT of dislikes.
<AJIsAwesome> *NO*
<Reikim> Let's play Spot Reikim's Bersek Trigger~
<JESmith71> otakon: Watch if you dare: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHJNBZ2rrMM

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> even i got that one
<Kinixys> G'night.
<cachi01|phone> oni_link dude...... I fucking love your song

*Shizuka 13starts rereading to parse in grammar nazi mode... slowly curls up into a ball...

<Reikim> Incidentally, the same thing happens over and over across some several thousand words.
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Prepare to have your jimmies rustled.
<AJIsAwesome> night Kinixys :)
<Dken2021|FireEmblem> no, no, not that christmas story!
<flutter_spin> lol
<JESmith71> At least it's DVD only and won't be wasting theater space
<HoodyNinja> Good evenink, bronystate
<otakon> thank gd for that at least
<Reikim> So. Tense shifts. Stabbity stabbity.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi HoodyNinja. :)
<otakon> but goddammit
<cachi01|phone> Hi HoodyNinja :)
<Dken2021|FireEmblem> lemme guess, it's set in modern times eh?
<Cades> Going to bed. Peace :D
<Dken2021|FireEmblem> oh wait, nvm
<Shizuka> 13has, remembered
<Kinixys> Bye AJ.
<HoodyNinja> No stream? :o
<DerpyMuffins> Hi HoodyNinja
<Shizuka> 13few days, few hours
<Dken2021|FireEmblem> ello there HoodyNinja
<oni_link> cachi01|phone: thanks :) thats my original piece for that Famicompo-Mini competition I told you about. And that was all done on Famitracker, and its a straight up 2A03 (stock NES) song with no samples for the drums :3
<flutter_spin> At least Hansel and Gretel: Witchhunters looked interesting
<Shizuka> 13only a mere few hours is making my hair stand on end...
<flutter_spin> Not that I would ever see it.
<thelonepony> hi HoodyNinja
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: silly
<SaxyPretender> 0,14say what
<Reikim> Well, to be fair, that's not /technically/ incorrect.
<Reikim> It's just really, really bad.
<Shizuka> 13it's horribly redundant
*HoodyNinja pulls AJIsAwesome, otakon, DerpyMuffins, and thelonepony into a glomp pile
<cachi01|phone> oni_link nice! I hope you win. I really like the song but........man.....
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hey saxy want to play guns of icarus ?
<Reikim> And repetitive and redundant and yeah.
<cachi01|phone> 19 MB
<cachi01|phone> Lol
<PinkiePry> Is dead snow good?
<Shizuka> 13it's horribly terribly awful and redundant
<Reikim> It's bad writing but not, strictly, bad grammar.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14firearms of who now?
<flutter_spin> I cannot wait for Wrek-it-Ralph
<flutterchu> HoodyNinja: what's going on?
<Reikim> Shhhh Shizu I'm trying to stop myself from throwing my laptop out the window.
<HoodyNinja> ^
<otakon> neither can I
<HoodyNinja> flutterchu: The sky
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm not familiar with that game, TheGreatAndPowerfulT >.<
<Cynder7> 6D:
<otakon> however, Christmas Story 2 can die in a fire
<otakon> and then throw the fire into a lake
<HoodyNinja> Wut? Christmas Story?
<otakon> and then throw the lake into the sun
<flutterchu> HoodyNinja: youre only supposed to say that when i say whats up
<Reikim> It's the tense shift that is slowly fragmenting my psyche right now.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> no excusses
<otakon> PUT UP THE LINK
<HoodyNinja> and then throw the sun into a black hole
<Reikim> I don't /care/ what your native language is, you have NO EXCUSE for a tense shift.
<PinkiePry> What do you throw the black hole into?
<oni_link> cachi01|phone: its Famitracker... when you create a WAV file it tends to be big. If you had something that plays NSF files then the ORGINAL file would have been 11KB :/
<Cynder7> 6I could try to but it'd probably take forever cause it keeps getting stuck >.<
<HoodyNinja> PinkiePry: Pinkie Pie
<Dken2021|FireEmblem> so who else expects another gritty story reboot?
<PinkiePry> :D
<Cynder7> 6Night ^^
<JESmith71> HoodyNinja: Yeah they're making an stupid DTV sequel to it
<HoodyNinja> after that, nothing
<Reikim> If you come from German or one of the Romance tongues especially, I will have zero tolerance.
<HoodyNinja> JESmith71: I dont even know what Cristmas story is
<cachi01|phone> oni_link can you transform it to mp3?
<cachi01|phone> Convert*
<HoodyNinja> im just happy to add to the conversation
<Dark92Enigma> How bad is A Christmas Story 2? iT CAN'T BE AS BAD AS NOT GETTING IN THE DAMN LOTTERY WITH ONE SAME E-MAIL!!! Or can it be, otakon?
<cachi01|phone> I dont hace pc and my phone is really lacking.of memory
<otakon> PinkiePry: another galaxy
<HoodyNinja> So, I shake my ass better than all the girls at my school, and I go to a ghetto ass school

<Dark_Horst> timelord magic
<Dark_Horst> love it
<Spectrum_Rush> question why does a hobo have a camcorder
<Pwnies> The face
<Pwnies> of a million satans
<Dark_Horst> Spectrum_Rush: "found" it
<Meanwhile> Because ten years off nine hundred
<Sumica> 00,10not a hobo
<Spectrum_Rush> its nawt
<thegt90> free internet im stayin
<Meanwhile> Man that'd be soul destroying.
<Buytoast> goddammit rose
<Buytoast> why does he still let them come along when they always got to mess everything up
<Pwnies> I'd steal everything I could find
<Meanwhile> Because he's lonely.
<Sumica> 00,10bet he wishes he had a sonic leash
<Pwnies> Then travel between universes
<Dark_Horst> yeah mickey, he has known you for what, 3 episodes? of course he'll follow YOU!
<Dark_Horst> idiot
<Meanwhile> Still, imagine how much it'd suck if you found another world where your parents are way better off and the key missing thing is you.
<Pwnies> AH
<Sumica> 00,10those ear things are just silly
<Meanwhile> I imagine carrying phones around by hand probably looks silly from that point of view.
<Pwnies> He's listening to Deathcore silly
<Spectrum_Rush> should they be using L85s?
<Pwnies> Why would they
<Sumica> 00,10le sigh

<Meanwhile> I'd mail you mine Sumi but Idk how much the post'd cost.
<Sumica> 00,10that could be kinda deadly if say you were driveing
<Pwnies> What would happen if you where flying a plane
<Buytoast> maybe it makes them all stop their cars
<Sumica> 00,10eh it's not that Meanwhile, some one stole mine.
<Meanwhile> Yeah doesn't seem that practical.
<Pwnies> Or jumping in the air for that manner
<Dark_Horst> daily download. or: free buffet for every pickpocketing hobo
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Really? That sucks fierce.

<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: thought you said you quit the casino and worked at a bakery, or am i just crazy?
<Meanwhile> Pfft.

<Sumica> 00,10best song to slaughter to
<Meanwhile> You report the theft?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah

<Pwnies> oh
<Pwnies> well maybe then
<Sumica> 00,10aye

<Sumica> 00,10I have no hopes on that one
<Pwnies> Oh god my back hurts so much
<Sumica> 00,10but it would be nice
<Sumica> 00,10this ep seems long
<Dark_Horst> says black
<Dark_Horst> says "sorry black guys" directly afterwards
<Dark_Horst> oh box
<Meanwhile> I think this was a two parter originally.
<Dark_Horst> *boy
<Meanwhile> Maybe it's condensed it.
<Sumica> 00,10more of sorry mr president for serveing illigale booze
<Spectrum_Rush> oh i love that gif
<Dark_Horst> maye both
<Sumica> 00,10still is a two parter
<Meanwhile> Hmm. Uncut footage?
<Sumica> 00,10posable but doubt it with netflix
<Meanwhile> Maybe it just looks longer than usual then.
<Spectrum_Rush> maybe it was a... three parter
<Spectrum_Rush> or a special
<Sumica> 00,10I think it's more of it's dull
<Meanwhile> Yeah, two parter, this is the slow part.
<Jim> Ohai Bronystate
<Meanwhile> Allo Jim.
<Dark_Horst> torchwood drop
<Spectrum_Rush> Torchwood
<Meanwhile> Gotta love that marching sound.
<Jim> Tennant is just an amazing Doctor

<Meanwhile> Cybermen are very tragic things.
<Sumica> 00,10I realy do love this version of the theme
<Jim> so symphonic
<Meanwhile> Tenth Doctor had pretty much the best /everything/ of all the reboot series.
<DaringDerpy> nice work for a low budget production
<Jim> derp
<Dark_Horst> wu?
<Meanwhile> Guess I'll use the intermish to replenish my tea.
<XylemTube> Operand, op-operand
<DaringDerpy> I think the eleventh doctor fits into the madman role better. The tenth one looks too clean.
<DaringDerpy> too perfect

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Hai Jim :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I want the Wii U o-o
<Jim> it looks fun, aye
<Meanwhile> I hate Nintendo.
<Jim> when will it be out?
<Spectrum_Rush> Cybusmen
<Jim> awww
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Jim: November 18th in North America
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Meanwhile: :<
<Panda> Nintendo Sucks.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:<
<Buytoast> oh boy
<Phase4> 00,02Panda, you must have had a booring childhood :P
<Jim> ah, looks like I won't get to try one for a while then
<Sumica> 00,10I hear if you give game stop a ton of games you can save 150 bucks on a preorder
<Meanwhile> I spent my childhood outside.
<Panda> Phase4, allow me to explain. I love old nintendo... I dont like what it has become today.
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, as i said, booring
<Jim> Why would you give away games, Sumica ?
<Sumica> 00,10I would not
<Meanwhile> It was only after everyone moved away that I started morphing into a nerd like you lot.
<Phase4> 00,02Panda, its not that different from what i've seen
<Panda> besides, SB, I wouldn't be streaming for you if I hated *all* of nintendo would I ^^
<Jim> The games you'd have to give away would probably exceed 150$ too
<Resonantwaves> Hello! everyone
<Jim> hi Resonantwaves
<Buytoast> he looks sort of like carlton
<Jim> Shocking!
<Meanwhile> I wouldn't mind Nintendo if they didn't poor their resources into motion controls and the same 6 or 7 franchises they've got every year.
<Jim> Future (C)
*NewSuperBronyU licks Panda on the nose
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02When is your gaming stream again? :D
<Spectrum_Rush> now was it Ricky or Mickey that died?
<Resonantwaves> Hi Jim
<Meanwhile> pour*
<Resonantwaves> Superbrony!
<Panda> Phase4, these days its just recycles of classics slapped with a new name... I wish they would branch themselves out and do more other than just recreate older titles. Furthermore, I dont like the fact they do certain things for money under the guice of "Improvement"
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Rush: Ricky.
<Jim> dat salute
<Meanwhile> Panda: Finally someone who gets it. I could snog you.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02But...Nintendo :<
<Panda> NewSuperBronyU, Well I said tomorrow, only because I thought today was friday ^^ But I'll be streaming for 24 hours starting saturday >.<
<Sumica> 00,10so how much are they chargeing for wattered down internet and nintendo approved facebook?
<Panda> Meanwhile, we could be possibly thinking the same thing.
<Panda> Sumica XD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Sumica: But...it not dat ;^;
<alexxm> hey guys
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Panda: Okies :3
<Meanwhile> However much, it's too much.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02alexxm: Hai :D
<Buytoast> 399 united states american money
<Meanwhile> Allo alexxm.
<Jim> 1 million monies
<Jim> ohai alexxm
<Panda> ^^ SB, please PM me ideas :) I dont have an extensive library of games :)
<DaringDerpy> making video games is a risky business. 80% of the projects never amortize. only 5% bring decent profit. not an environment for experiments
<Jim> The Doctor never really has a plan, it's all on the fly
<alexxm> hey NewSuperBronyU Meanwhile and Jim how are things
<Meanwhile> DaringDerpy: Which is tragic.
<Panda> ^
<Sumica> 00,10only nintendo could rebrand the internet and sell it as new
<Jim> They're doing that?
<Jim> Man, miss the time when game consoles could stay consoles, and not try hard to be computers.
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<Buytoast> mickey is so damn useless
<Meanwhile> Well, given how much better computers are in general, can't blame them.
<Sumica> 00,10you can even leave tweets in games how you died alot at one point
*Resonantwaves makes weird sounds
<Sumica> 00,10and every one else can see it when they die
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I wish computers would just go back to doing Excel documents and leave gaming to the consoles.
<Panda> Phase4 :( btw I didnt mean to upset you.
*AdamTheDuck licks Resonantwaves
<alexxm> aw i missed some doctor who
<Meanwhile> Pfft, you're like a luddite Super.
<Sumica> 00,10computeres gamed before consoles
<Phase4> 00,02Panda, you didnt, it was all in good fun
<Jim> PONG
*Resonantwaves points at AdamtheDuck
<Resonantwaves> O_O
<Panda> NewSuperBronyU I disagree :) that fave that there is PC gaming means I get to torrent all the titles I please. err... I mean Buy all the titles I please.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, computeres everythinged before home consoles
<Panda> fact*
<Malk> Dr.Whooves?
<Jim> yyay~
<Dark_Horst> gaming started with computers and will die with computers when time ends
<Buytoast> @NINTENDOMINATION lawl i deid at thsi level leik 15 times XD i'm such a nerd ;P
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Computers Created, Consoles Innovated
<Dark_Horst> consoles are just oversized gameboys
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Just because you're the first to something doesn't make you automatically the best.
<Meanwhile> I have nothing against consoles, I have something against bad consoles.
<Sumica> 00,10innovation is not always good
<Phase4> 00,02consoles are platforms for games, its the games that matter
<Jim> not really, game boys are downsized consoles
<Prick> what happen to Superbrony64
<Dark_Horst> innovated. riiiight7
<Phase4> 00,02good game designers can make good games on any platform
<DaringDerpy> still waiting for a console interface that can compete with keyboard and mouse. the guis of the console ports are horrible
<Sumica> 00,10and Phase4 is right
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Prick: He was replaced by me. Too outdated. I'm more for the 21st Century lifestyle :D
<Panda> Phase4 that is a very good point ^^
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah, computeres did VR and failed but hey nintendo had to try it too
<Dark_Horst> means: fangasming for the wiiU
<Jim> So like all the BS microsoft promoted at E3?
<Prick> NewSuperBronyU: I miss the thee ol SuperBrony64, I don't like change D:
<Dark_Horst> VR is a tricky bitch anyway
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, the gameboyfacehugger thing COULD be done now but its not yet worth it imho
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02You mean MicroPOOP and STUPIDony?
<Meanwhile> There's nothing wrong with innovation, but Nintendo hasn't 'innovated' anything worth existing.
<Sumica> 00,10man you realy had to reach for that one super
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game << there is this thing
<Malk> Consoles just a money pit for me
<Buytoast> oh boy, kickstarter
<alexxm> why wern't the guards for the blimp cybermen
<Phase4> 00,02NewSuperBronyU, you have no idea how right those are
<Buytoast> It's like you're really throing your money away!
<Phase4> 00,02knowing some of the tech behind their consoles and software
<DaringDerpy> nice
<Sumica> 00,10plot alexxm
<Jim> but I like throwing my money at the computer screen
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Nintendo is bringing true 1080p HD gaming to home TVs for the first time with the Wii U
<Meanwhile> Woop de doo
<Meanwhile> And the first thing they'll glue to it is a remake of Mario
<Meanwhile> Again.
<Engi> ^
<Meanwhile> Because that's all they can do. Remake Mario.
<Phase4> 00,02its about time they tried something new with mario
<Meanwhile> And people will buy it, because people are thick.
*Engi is not impressed with Nintendo.
<Jim> Super Duper Mario Universe Extreme Makover 2.0
<Malk> Buytoast I could buy a 50 inch tv and a really nice computer for the price of 2 consoles
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I actually kid about that statement I said before ><
<Sumica> 00,10first time for them perhaps
<Meanwhile> Nintendo should change it's name to Rehash.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02The Wii U will be the best console ever \:D/
<Jim> Ah, queueing, something britians know
<Sumica> 00,10till it's outdated in 2 years
<Phase4> 00,02everyone complained about the controllers but i actually liked them
<Phase4> 00,02for the wii i meen
<Meanwhile> Motion controls are such a waste of time.
<Prick> Groovy...
<Phase4> 00,02wiimote + nunchuck is very comefortable to hold
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: when will i be able to buy that VR thing there?
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, i dont agree but we've not seem them used particuarly well yet
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, no idea
<Jim> Emotions
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Sumica: Mass Effect 3 is coming to the Wii U :)
<Meanwhile> And we won't see them used particularly well in this generation.
<Meanwhile> Not until there's some form of actual motion feedback.
*Resonantwaves pokes Superbrony
<Sumica> 00,10about time nintendo got a system with some power to run good games >_>
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02^-^
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02It will include all the DLC too :O
<Meanwhile> The Wii U can go drown in a ditch.
<Malk> Ill just run the games on my computer instead of a console
*Spectrum_Rush not sure if attempt at trolling
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Meanwhile: whhhy ;~;
<Sumica> 00,10shame it will be all alone in the multyplayer
<Meanwhile> For propogating the intense waste of space that is Nintendo.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Nintendo is GOOD
<Meanwhile> No, it isn't.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02It is the future.
<Meanwhile> Hahahahaha
<Engi> Not really.
<Malk> Lol
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, meh, i'ma be over here enjoying my zelda
<Meanwhile> Nintendo makes all its money by remaking it's old stuff.
<Meanwhile> And you want to label it "the future" ?
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, no, it makes all its money by remaking its old stuff really well
<Engi> Nintendo would be good if they knew how to do anything that wasn't a rehash or a new "game" for little kids and older folks
<Sumica> 00,10poor cybermen
<Meanwhile> Buzz off Phase, played one Super New Mario Bros Super New 2 played them all.

<Meanwhile> So Sumi, or Phase, do you play on the same server on this Ogame thing?
<Sumica> 00,10too many full song moments
<Spell-of-Gaming> I think the rule one of making a sequel is that the sequel shouldn't be aware of its popularity.
<Klumzeedragon> alexxm: It's going well. :) How are you?

<PinkiePry> Morning everypony. :)
<Jim> Hi PinkiePry
<alexxm> how are you PinkiePry
<MadSurge> Hey PinkiePry!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Some of the long musicals were unnesscary.

<Jim> Mad Moxxi
<therainbowvortex> hey everypony i need a hug
<MASF123|> Normal Mann vs. Machine is no upgrades per wave or extra unlockable items?
<Klumzeedragon> Rainbow was very Tony Stark there.

<Sumica> 00,10MASF123|, you get an item for wining in mann up
<Ryunosuke> that thunderstruck
<Jim> Surplex that
<Ryunosuke> that ff6
<MadSurge> ^
<Gold_Demona> Bear was a boss?
<Klumzeedragon> MASF123|: Nah. It has upgrades per wave and some items can be found, but Mann Up has a gaurenteed item.
<Sumica> 00,10and it's the hard modes of the maps
<MadSurge> MOTHERFUCKER SUPLEXED A TRAIN
<alexxm> fluttershy suplexed a bear

<Madbro> LOL u2 relference pinkie
<Ryunosuke> that lambcho[
<Gold_Demona> Who bothers fighting the ghost train? *gives it a Phoenix so it dies*
<Gold_Demona> Phoenix Down*
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: did you see Sabin suplex the Ghost Train boss? :D
<Sumica> 00,10this bit was some great editing
<DoctoDoctorWho> vamanos vamanos!
<AdamTheDuck> Because then I can infect you with the g-virus therainbowvortex o.o
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: No, cuz I always give the train a Phoenix Down, and it dies instantly. :P
<Klumzeedragon> MASF123: But they only cost $.99 a Mann Up ticket. It's not that that neccassary.
<MASF123> So Mann Up mode, is basically "Don't pussy out hard mode" with an 100% of winning an item.
<Sumica> 00,10if you do manage to do all 6 maps in mann up mode you get a strange weapon
<therainbowvortex> AdamTheDuck yay im infected do i get off school now?
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Phoenix Downs are precious! Don't waste them! :D
<Buytoast> Aren't there 9 maps?
<Madbro> whoever made this vid is pr0
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I didn't waste it. It made the boss fight a hell of a lot easier.
<Sumica> 00,10yeah MASF123, you can also get extra items if some one has a squad ticket
<Ryunosuke> ...
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: I heard that there's another one like that with Luke climbing up pinkie and like cutting her belly in that style. Don't know about that though...
<Sumica> 00,10mann up only uses the hard modes
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I don't remember the Ghost Train being difficult...
<Ryunosuke> that tank
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Me neither. Cuz I always instant kill it. XD
<alexxm> i'd vote for him
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: With Phoenix Downs
<DoctoDoctorWho> no, medic for president
<MASF123> There are squad tickets as well, wow just to add confusion.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh my god, yes, it's raining in our place

*Klumzeedragon claps "Best answer!"
<Pwnies> The dancing ruins the mood :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> 42 is actually from Alice in Wonderland
<Spell-of-Gaming> Winrar's estimated times are seriously wrong as hell.
<Pwnies> Winrar is retarded
<Pwnies> But it gets the job done
<Ponies47> Spalt
<alexxm> forever
<Gold_Demona> Is that a knife or a spatula?
<MadSurge> And thus Pinkie was born!
<Pwnies> Then she kills everyone with a knife
<Spell-of-Gaming> "9 hours" left before a file finishes extracting.

<Meanwhile> Don't be silly. It's proven fact that gingers are soulless.
<Pwnies> No one have any souls
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, proven how and when?
<Meanwhile> Proven by poking them with sticks and seeing if anything leaked.
<Pwnies> Gingers just lack perfect skin
<Pwnies> And have those ugly as shit freckles
<Pwnies> OH GOD THEY ARE SOMEWHAT ANNOYING
<Gold_Demona> Whooooo are yo?~

<Gold_Demona> Metal Gear Pinkie
<Sumica> 00,10infact I am sure it will max out your storage for a bit
<Pwnies> Well this is better that when I first saw it
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu you're apparently not familiar with the common "Gingers don't have souls" joke so I'll just nudge that aside for now.
<Gold_Demona> Are YOU Afraid of the Dark? O.o
<Pwnies> This video lacks Splinter Cell
<Saturn_> 08,01wheeee
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, I've heard it before. It's dehumanizing to gingers.
<Ponies47> Hi Saturn_
<Meanwhile> You're too kind Sumica, now let's hope I can figure out how to properly utilise it.
<thelonepony> hi Saturn_
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: In which case you should acknowledge it's only for comedic purposes.
<Pwnies> YESH
<Klumzeedragon> Hows it going Saturn_ ? :)
<Rommulus> Hi Saturn_
<alexxm> how are things Saturn_
<Sumica> 00,10eh not realy, that is like 3 hours of production from one planet
<Saturn> 08,01good
<Saturn> 08,01ksh
<Saturn> 08,01*ish
<Saturn> 08,01i kinda blacked out from exhaustikn yesterday
<Pwnies> What and why
<Saturn> 08,01working for 24 hours straight
<Saturn> 08,01not good
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, I acknowledge that it is for comedic purposes. I also acknowledge that despite it's comedic purposes, it's racist humor.
<Meanwhile> Yeah not good, you need more sleep.
<Klumzeedragon> Well that's not that good Saturn. ): Are you okay now?
<Pwnies> That sounds so boring
<Saturn> 08,01im fine now
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu: Implying gingers are a race.
<Resonantwaves> Hello everyone!
<killerpony7733> Pwnies May be so but he has to.
<Pwnies> Like I can barely sit still without punching someone
*Resonantwaves panics
<Saturn> 08,01back at work
<Rommulus> Hi there Resonantwaves
<Saturn> 08,01last day
<thelonepony> hi Resonantwaves
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Resonantwaves
<Saturn> 08,01hen im freeee
<Resonantwaves> howdy! :)
<Klumzeedragon> Hey Resonantwaves. :)
<Meanwhile> Sumica there some manner of friends list in this thing?
<Saturn> 08,01well, free to study and run a pony con
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Ponies47> I remember when I first became a brony I didn't watch this video until maybe 2 maybe 3 months after I became a brony :$
<Pwnies> Willy Wankas
<Sumica> 00,10should be able to by going to my planets under the galexy tab and such
<Sumica> 00,10check for my planet
<Pwnies> Oh god the stomach
<killerpony7733> Epix sax spike
<Kandarihu> If the whole "Blood Type implies personality" can be shot down as racist, the "Gingers have no Soul" joke is certainly more blatant racism.
<Resonantwaves> o3o
<Pwnies> Not racism
<Klumzeedragon> Ponies47: I probably didnt see this until 2 months ago. :P And I've seen both like 5 times. :D Love them so much.
<Pwnies> More just beingn a douche
<Saturn> 08,01geneticism
<Meanwhile> Says I don't have enough deuterium if I attempt to alter anything.
<Sumica> 00,10I am not raceist, I hate everyone.
<Saturn> 08,01phenotypism
<Ponies47> Klumzeedragon: They are so awesome! :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't think you know what a joke is.
<Meanwhile> ^
<Kandarihu> Pwnies, you were the one complaining, even if it was in jest, of gingers' freckles.
<Spell-of-Gaming> You're kind of taking a joke seriously.
<Saturn> 08,01im not racist, i just miss my man.
<Pwnies> It was jest
<Sumica> 00,10I hate space
<killerpony7733> Sumica what's space? >_>
<Klumzeedragon> Saturn: Go get him Han Solo!..... When you can!
<MadSurge> So. if we can stream these, why not the Grand Galloping Collab? :D
<Pwnies> :D
<Pwnies> Great Idea Madsurge
<killerpony7733> Putting on the ritz
<Pwnies> But the earrape is horrifying
<MadSurge> KOOYANISQATSI
<Meanwhile> Sumica apparently I need deuterium to even look at your planet.
<DrBlade> :[
<Klumzeedragon> MadSurge: I have not seen these... are they similar? Or is it bad? :D
<Sumica> 00,10yeah takes 10 per page view
<Saturn> 08,01mfw i accidentally ha bittorrent running in the background on my tablet, seeding while im connected to the ultra fast uni netwprk
<Klumzeedragon> These being the Grand Galloping Collab.
<Meanwhile> That's...interesting.
<MadSurge> Klumzeedragon: quality varies because it's all different authors :D
<Saturn> 08,01they really dont like people bittprrenting illegal content
<Pwnies> yeah
*Saturn 08,01will probably receive a warning e-mail abput it
<Pwnies> But what can they actually do
<MadSurge> MORE OFFSPRING
<Resonantwaves> goodnight everyone!
<Sumica> 00,10never said we could not stream it just saying I dont plan on streaming it
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, you have encryption turned on?
<Meanwhile> Night Resonantwaves.
<Sumica> 00,10because it's long and it's mostly crap
<Saturn> 08,01Phase4: of course
<Klumzeedragon> Saturn: I remember your email you posted here. :D
<MadSurge> Sumica: Kinda :D
<Saturn> 08,01so i guess hey can really tell
<Meanwhile> Scrubs. <3
<MadSurge> Sumica: we should find the better bits
<Phase4> http://www.blackmesasource.com/ << its half life and there is a 3
<DrBlade> :'(
<MadSurge> And stream those
<Sumica> 00,10problem is better is subjective
<Klumzeedragon> :D
<Phase4> lol theres like no one in here
<Phase4> ohai Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Great. I know little of Half Life and have no intentions of learning about it.
<Sumica> 00,10most seem to think better invloce the lets crack speakers sounds
<MadSurge> Sumica: the ones without earrape, mostly
<Meanwhile> Heya.
<Pwnies> Madsruge
<Sumica> 00,10invlove*
<Pwnies> Madsurge What are you doing man

<Phase4> i've still not finished hl2
<Sumica> 00,10ok fuck it it's too early to try and type proper
<Pwnies> Is
<Pwnies> The goddamn principle
<Meanwhile> I played that for about...twenty minutes then got bored and uninstalled it.
<MadSurge> I don't know what I'm rambling about!
<Phase4> ^ about my reaction with cod4
<Pwnies> The Great Gallopiong Collab :P
<Pwnies> And how you don't want earrape
<Phase4> first level was excelent, then everything got really dark and i couldnt see where i was suposed to go
<Sumica> 00,10yeah i dont care for it Pwnies so it wont be streamed
<Meanwhile> Sounds fun.
<Klumzeedragon> I don't know what we're yelling abooooout!
<Sumica> 00,10and that is the princaple of what i do
<Pwnies> I wasn't counting on it
<Pwnies> I'm not retarded
<Kandarihu> Hmm, would Koyaanisqatsi count as an A or a B movie? I'm thinking B, right?
<MadSurge> Sumica: good thing we have the Friendship is Gic poops, huh?
<Meanwhile> Hey why do you need deuterium to look up planets on Ogame?
<Sumica> 00,10never heard of it
<Pwnies> You guys aren't going to just melt your brain cells for fun are you
<Klumzeedragon> Sounds like a B movie. Cause I have heard f it.
<Saturn> 08,01Kandarihu: b, definitely
<Pwnies> Madsurge that's kind of too far :P
<Sumica> 00,10go blow your brains out on your own time
<Klumzeedragon> havent*
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: philip glass?
<Phase4> to what now?
<MadSurge> YESH
<Spell-of-Gaming> OH GOD YES.
<Ponies47> YES THIS! :F
<Ponies47> *:D
<Meanwhile> Well I tried looking up Sumi's planet but it won't let me without deuterium.
<Phase4> oh wow
<Phase4> i never noticed that
<Klumzeedragon> They played this on Brony Breakdown tonight. :D
<Kandarihu> That Diamond Dog is looking SUUUUUUUUUPPEEEEEEEEEER!
<Meanwhile> You probably had deuterium by the time you tried making a friends list. :I
<Phase4> Meanwhile, whats the cordinants for your planet? i can send you some
<MadSurge> EWW DERPY
<Klumzeedragon> Maybe cause he's a rooooooobot!
<Sumica> 00,10if you look later flutter shys haduken is in pinkies bit
<Meanwhile> 1:8:12
<Kandarihu> Klumzeedragon, more like he's a cyborg.
<Phase4> 00,02SOMEONE MAKE THIS
<Sumica> 00,10then again so is spike that rarity hit.
<Pwnies> How would a Pony go about getting a earring?
<Klumzeedragon> Kandarihu: True...
<MadSurge> Who's Mystery Ben?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh god
<Ponies47> o3o
<Saturn> 08,01Pwnies: samme way as a human/
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: And so it the "Eat the pea proffesor!" Luna. :D
<Klumzeedragon> is*
<Pwnies> Without thumbs?
<Kandarihu> Phase4, would this be a romhack then?
<Sumica> 00,10time to put on a playlist and get some sleep
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, arguable, last console to use actual roms was the n64
<Phase4> 00,02then again 'diskhack' doesnt have the same ring to it
<Kandarihu> Phase4, how about a romhack of the GBA or DS version.
<MadSurge> Sumica: Ok. tell us when you leave so we can tell you good night :D
<Phase4> 00,02oh yeah, ds still uses roms
<Kandarihu> ISOhack
<Klumzeedragon> Sounds good Sumi. :) Sleep well! Hope you arent bummed tomorrow~
<Sumica> 00,10also sounds like some painfull thing done to ones junk Phase4
<Meanwhile> Night Sumica.
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, XD
<Spell-of-Gaming> I think N64 was the last Nintendo console that uses ROMs.
<Phase4> 00,02this is a good pmv
<Spell-of-Gaming> Home console, I mean.
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, i meen the last any console, roms started to become more expencive than disks
<Sumica> 00,10heading out now enjoy some g3.5
<Phase4> 00,02by which i meen non portable
<MadSurge> Phase4: they'll find other ways to emulate
<Phase4> 00,02hey guys, ponies
<MadSurge> :O WUT
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> hooray
<Meanwhile> Trolled.
<DrBlade> WUT
<Ponies47> Sumica: Yay!
<Meanwhile> Damnit.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh god, G3.5?
<Pwnies> SUMICA :|
<Spell-of-Gaming> NO.
<DrBlade> NOONO
<Pwnies> :|
<Meanwhile> Hehehe.
<Pwnies> :|
<Spell-of-Gaming> We didn't even ask for any.
<Pwnies> :|
<DrBlade> :'(
<Pwnies> :(
<Kandarihu> We never asked for this
<DrBlade> NO
<Phase4> 00,02Spell-of-Gaming, roms still make more sense than disks for portable devices. dvds in the psp were a silly idea
<Pwnies> I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS
<DrBlade> HOLY SHIET
<thelonepony> NONONONONO!
<DrBlade> DRUGS
<DrBlade> DRUGS!!
<Gold_Demona> Okay, guys. I'm back with breakfast, and I'm AHH!!!!
<Meanwhile> People sure do overreact to old pony gens.
<Pwnies> GAHHHH
<Spell-of-Gaming> Is this where we all turn out to be ******** in the end.
<Klumzeedragon> Gold_Demona: Good timing. :P
<Pwnies> ITS ALL TOILET SOUNDS
<Phase4> 00,02Meanwhile, to be fair this is absolute crap
<Kandarihu> Okay. Is this G3 or G3.5?
<Gold_Demona> Meanwhile: Just Gen 3. o_o
<Spell-of-Gaming> G1 wasn't that bad.
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, 3.5 i think
<Phase4> 00,023.6 is the one you run screaming frmo
<Pwnies> yeah 3.5
<Gold_Demona> Kandarihu: I don't think it matters. :P
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: it's an endurance trial! :D
<Phase4> 00,02from'
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z204/prince-dari/ManUp.jpg
<Meanwhile> Phase4: True, but regardless, people would overreact anyway.
<Spell-of-Gaming> I don't run around screaming how horrible G1 or G2 is.
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/DRXo4.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush|Zzz, that looks like a mallet head ontop of a spanner
<Pwnies> http://www.matthollingsworth.net/home/photos//hrvatska/new_years_2006_low/images/DSC00293.jpg
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: also, it's Sumi. He likes to troll us :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> Don't knock it till you try it.
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: lol, I know. It's all in good fun. XD

<Ponies47> Oh Sumica and your trolling. Thanks for the stream as always. Godo night :3
<Ponies47> *Good
<Meanwhile> Klumzeedragon: Thankfully, he's not.
<Kandarihu> ATTENTION: FOR EVERYPONY WHO STOPPED THEIR STREAM DUE TO G3.5, THE VIDEO HAS BEEN PREEMPTED. IT IS SAFE TO RETURN
<Phase4> you buy it or get epic lucky and find it
<Meanwhile> I hope sea ponies show up in G4 at some point.
*Kandarihu instantly regrets the allcaps

<Pwnies> bread means bed
<Pwnies> I hate bread
<Meanwhile> Sigh. Why do I have to mess with the power levels this early.
<Klumzeedragon> Sumica: What kind? :O
<Meanwhile> That should be stuff I'm doing after I've got ships, not before.
<Meanwhile> Berry Punch is best Sentry Buster.

*Spectrum_Rush|Zzz shudders at the thought of a hole puncher ,feeling a twinge of pain in his left index finger -_¬
<Pwnies> Uh oh

<Klumzeedragon> I have next to nothing on TF2. :D I have only Mann Co. Hat. And I think a new ax.
<Pwnies> It feels good to be a 2010 TF2 Player
<Gold_Demona> Same here. :p
<Ponies47> And Roller Coaster Tycoon won't install on my new computer. IT WAS SO CLOSE! D:
<Gold_Demona> D:
<Pwnies> I trick F2P's into binding keys to hrrible things
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Pwnies: if you truly want to know ask me another time
<Kandarihu> Uh oh. The Desktop Ponies website is dead.

<Klumzeedragon> Kandarihu: Whaaaaat... D: Lame...
<Ponies47> I'm best at Engineer, Heavy 2nd
<MadSurge> I love how a reliable strategy to deal with them is "pick up sentry, wait for the thing to get close, go away once it stops, watch it hermlessly blow up :D
<MadSurge> *harmlessly
<Ponies47> When I'm playing MvM sometimes when there is a Sentry Buster I start running and it chases me around the map.
<Klumzeedragon> Pwnies: I suck with all characters. :) I can only do good on MvM. And only with Engie or Pyro. :D

<Saturn> 08,01its a bit too suggestive

<AdamTheDuck> Lol dat quick close tab

<Bronysith> my face hurts
<Saturn> 08,01what'd ou do to it?
*AdamTheDuck licks Bronysith
<Bronysith> when i was practicing my sword art yesterday, i landed on my face after practicing a roll
<Bronysith> still fun though
<AdamTheDuck> Is rolling in sword arts practical?
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: fast dodging
<Bronysith> you can also gain more distance from rolling instead of just a quick sidestep AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> Seems like a bit too much effort, you're losing eye contact and you're on the ground for a short second. :/
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: well if you are an amateur
<Ninjazz> Hello, everyone.
<Bronysith> hi Ninjazz
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Ninjazz
<Bronysith> damn it
<AdamTheDuck> When you say sword arts do you mean it as a sport?
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: yea, i train in it
<Bronysith> using a katana, very fun and very demanding
<Bronysith> swift strikes, fast movements
<Bronysith> Phase4: how are le mods for tf2?
<AdamTheDuck> Right, sorry I'm just thinking in my MMA mode, more into self defense and by rolling you put yourself in great risk in fights :/
<Phase4> 00,02all i have right now is applebloom hat and derpy scout
<Bronysith> Phase4: get big mac heavy
<AdamTheDuck> Phase4, get Tara Strong minigun :D
<Bronysith> AdamTheDuck: well sword fighting is much different from MMA
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah
<Bronysith> also recovery swings are fun to do
<Bronysith> as you come back from the roll you do a quick spin to gain more room
<Bronysith> and knick someones leg in the process
<AdamTheDuck> So much like fencing?
<Bronysith> nonononono
<Bronysith> Katanas
<Bronysith> not rapiers
<AdamTheDuck> Right oops, forgot you mentioned katanas 6_9
<Bronysith> when i spar with people we use non bladed katanas cause solid wooden ones hurt much more
<AdamTheDuck> So... What was it called? Kendo?
<Bronysith> especially since getting whacked in the kidneys with blunt weapons is very painful
<Bronysith> no it is a korean sword art called Gum Do
<AdamTheDuck> Right.
<AdamTheDuck> Interesting
<Bronysith> btw gum means sword in korean
<Ninjazz> Detective Swordshoe.
<Bronysith> HA
<Bronysith> dont be mocking my martial art please
<Ninjazz> Who called it mocking?
<Bronysith> you
<Ninjazz> No I didn't.
<Bronysith> gum in english is different then gum in korean
<IshSexiestPony> ohai poner pepple
<Ninjazz> It's called a play on words.
<Ninjazz> Hey, Ish.
<Bronysith> and phoenix wright is made by capcom, japanese people not koreans
<AdamTheDuck> Hello IshSexiestPony
*Bronysith glomps IshSexiestPony into Saturn
*IshSexiestPony licks Bronysith's cheek
*Bronysith licks Saturn s nose
<AdamTheDuck> Yay another lick enthusiast :D
*AdamTheDuck licks IshSexiestPony too :P
<Bronysith> LICKING PILE ON Saturn
*IshSexiestPony is hungry for duck a l'orange
<Moopy> Hmp dem freakin spawn killers
*IshSexiestPony stares at AdamTheDuck in hunger
*Bronysith puts Saturn ontop of IshSexiestPony
*IshSexiestPony puts Bronysith on top of a pike
*AdamTheDuck licks everyone on the pile :P
<Meanwhile> There is far too much /me in here.
<Ninjazz> ^
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<Bronysith> i shall eat you Meanwhile
<Moopy> 20% cooler
<Meanwhile> I'd be mean to you but I have a stomach ache and it's throwing my mood.
<IshSexiestPony> why does this look like a hacked level
<Bronysith> my brother went to waffle house last night...he was obviously hammered
<Bronysith> IshSexiestPony: cause it is
<Meanwhile> How is it hacked. It's a surf map.
<Bronysith> cause
<Bronysith> Tuning forks are the next BFGs
<IshSexiestPony> If he's playing multiplayer, hows he doing it on a hacked level
<AdamTheDuck> Dat dancing fish
<Meanwhile> That makes no sense Ish.
<Bronysith> y r people not using ?
<Ninjazz> Because correct grammar does not exist in most enclaves of the internet.
<Bronysith> and now Meanwhile is Ninjazz
<AdamTheDuck> Heil grammar!~
<Ninjazz> Also, IshSexiestPony, because it's a Valve game and they allow mods and hacks and other neat stuf.
<Bronysith> cause valve is best
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/26Vmo.png
<Bronysith> thats good stuff Meanwhile
<Bronysith> survey says
<twilight_sprinkle> grammar is overrated anyway
<Ninjazz> I just think correct word usage and pronunciation is sexy. So there you go.
<AdamTheDuck> Applejack engineer! Yes!
<Meanwhile> I respect the language.
<Bronysith> Mcdonalds is good stuff
<twilight_sprinkle> for me grammar is only important as long as the other person can understand you. beyond that, imo its not important
<Moopy> well not really
<Bronysith> I mean for using orphan meat, it is pretty good
<twilight_sprinkle> and Ninjaxx why cant i tab you
<twilight_sprinkle> *Ninjazz
<Ninjazz> Because you're pressing x twice? Lol.

<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz yeah
<Meanwhile> Holy shit, Mcdonalds isn't good for your health? Really? Stop the damn presses.
<Ninjazz> But you can't tab me?
<twilight_sprinkle> si seniore
<Ninjazz> That's... odd as hell.
<AdamTheDuck> Friendship Hooooves!
<Ninjazz> Perhaps I'm cursed?
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, tabbing has been glitchy for me lately

<killerpony7733> Sylandest Have you ever wanted orange but got lemon lime from a vending machine?
<Ninjazz> Do you not know that it's Half Life one updated on to true Source standards?
<Saturn> 08,01killerpony7733: coincidentally, that's the same amount of time a stable wormhole can be kept open for in stargate
<Ninjazz> The more you know! ~*
<Sylandest> killerpony7733: I cannot say I have, no :$
<Sylandest> morning, Saturn
<Bronysith> Saturn: you know, there is no such thing as coincedence
<killerpony7733> Sylandest Please tell me you got the reference~
<Bronysith> Saturn: only the illusion of coincedence
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: what makes black mesa source so good?
<Sylandest> killerpony7733: ...im gonna have to say no...granted, i only came to consciousness...30 minutes ago? :$
<killerpony7733> Bronysith ya know the half life source version of HL1 right?
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: OMF YOU'RE SUCH A PSEUDO GAMER IF YOU DONT KNOW ABOUT BLACK MES SOURCE
<Bronysith> i have half life source yes
<Bronysith> Saturn: no i have heard of it and everyone talks about it
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Then you know it made VERY FEW changes to the base game
<killerpony7733> Hardly source
<Ninjazz> ...
<Saturn> 08,01:P
<killerpony7733> This is a mod or total conversion of HL1 to actual source with alot more improved source graphics and weapons etc etc
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: im takin the piss
<Bronysith> Saturn: dont drink it
<Bronysith> killerpony7733: and it is free right?
<killerpony7733> It's techinally a HD HL1
<killerpony7733> Bronysith Yep you only need Source SDK 2007 to run it or any source game in general
<Bronysith> ahh
<Bronysith> well i will get it i guess
<Bronysith> Saturn: or be a bear grylls, should be interesting
<killerpony7733> But this is part 1 of the mod. It will contain 11 hours of the game the last and final part is gonna be released later
<flutterchu> HOLT IT/um hello everyone
<Alchemist> is black mesa source a new prequel or contemporary story for HL1?
<Ninjazz> It's just a true remake.
<killerpony7733> Alchemist Pretty much what Ninjazz said
<killerpony7733> It's a total HD remake of HL1 from scratch with guns models everything
<Alchemist> oh, but I thought there was a cource remake already, though I've never played with it.
<Dark_Horst> oh hey, 32 minutes
<Ninjazz> Alchemist, see the thing about that is that it's HL1's texture's and models put into the source engine. This was built from the ground up with Source.
<Vivix> The official source remake was a port to the source engine
<flutterchu> no one replied just as i expected :'(
<Dark_Horst> to waht
<killerpony7733> Vivix Yeah hardly anything remake worthy tbh
<Vivix> yeah-
<Alchemist> Ninjazz: wait, if its the same textures/models etc put into the source engine then what's the difference?
<Vivix> BMS however- oh man I've waited so many years for this
<Vivix> Alchemist, you got ragdolls and fancy water <,<
<Alchemist> thats it?
<Vivix> yeah HLS was--pretty much HL1 with ragdolls
<killerpony7733> Vivix Gotta say 11 hours or so is pretty damn impressive for just part 1
<Vivix> pretty much
<Vivix> yeah
<Alchemist> wow, sounds like a lazy money making effort...
<Vivix> well it was more like
<Ninjazz> Alchemist, nothing really.
<Vivix> it was free
<Ninjazz> Oh and a better flashlight.
<Vivix> but it was more like.."Hey, look what's possible with sdk"
<Ninjazz> That's pretty much Half Life Source.
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> but it was free right? I payed nothing-
<Ninjazz> Black Mesa Source attempts to fix that "problem".
<Vivix> or free with hl2?
<XAX> just under half an hour now till BM:S
<Vivix> aw yeah- so excited
<killerpony7733> Ninjazz Alongside making it even better
<Vivix> we'll probably crash the dl server <,<
<XAX> ikr.
<Ninjazz> killerpony7733, so much.
<Ninjazz> So much.
<Alchemist> Vivix: its 8 euros on steam
<killerpony7733> Yeah god knows how many are getting ready to DL the heck out of the server
<Vivix> The way they just reimagined maps for BMS- it looks so good
<Vivix> hehe
<Vivix> Alchemist, ah really? I think we got it for free with hl2 or... previous owners of HL1- or something
<Alchemist> Vivix: that might be, but now they actually want money for it :D
<Vivix> yeah
<Barbetos|AtWork> less than 30 minutesss...
<killerpony7733> Hehe i still got my original copies of HL1 HL1 OPFOR Blue shift+CS
*Vivix jitters
<killerpony7733> Mines a game of the year disc box
<Vivix> I have my original 1998 hl1 cd and opfor-
<Vivix> I had several hl1s because of the CS pack and such, but those are the only ones that survived time <,<
<Reikim> hl1?
<Reikim> Half Life 1?
<Vivix> yeah
<Alchemist> its frightening to think that when I had half life 1 I didnt have internet yet.
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Well, I'll be downloading it when I get my computer back.
<Bronysith> oh hi there Reikim didnt know you were up this early
<Vivix> Hehe, same
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Er, when I get my mom's laptop back.
<Reikim> I see Shizuka is following through on her promise.
<Reikim> Anybody here to rant at?
<flutterchu> my eyes feel wired when i move them now it's not pain i wonder why
<Reikim> Or ded?
<Vivix> brewing headache?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Reikim: eh?
<Meanwhile> You can rant at me in a short while once I've finished cleaning the degu out.
<Reikim> You've been up to long, go to sleep.
<Vivix> sometimes cold or headache makes them feel weird
<Reikim> Barbetos|AtWork: She said she'd be playing Black Mesa today last night.
<flutterchu> now my eyes are fine
<flutterchu> yay
<Reikim> Hm
<Reikim> Am I still here?
<Vivix> yeah
<Reikim> Huh.
<killerpony7733> Reikim nope >_>
<Twiglet_Spackle> apparently
<Alchemist> if you are seeing auras you are not a psychic, you are about to have a migraine :)
<Reikim> Odd, my computer claims it has no connection.
<Vivix> weird-
*Bronysith licks Reikim
<Barbetos|AtWork> We are your imagination.
<Vivix> Don't listen to him, we are real. promise
<Barbetos|AtWork> we always have been. You have been without internet for about 6 months now.
<Barbetos|AtWork> And you kind of made us to make up for that.
<Reikim> O.o
*Reikim has a nervous breakdown
<Bronysith> Reikim: why you break down?
*Reikim .exe has stopped responding. Would you like to send an error report?
*Bronysith puts Saturn ontop of Reikim
<flutterchu> nintendo power's coming to an end
*Barbetos|AtWork sends error report
<Alchemist> yeah, that should fix it :D
<Reikim> Really?
<RaveBrony> Good morning, everyone :)
<Reikim> Why would they be coming to an end?
<Bronysith> Saturn: have fun with Reikim
<Barbetos|AtWork> Morning Rave
<Barbetos|AtWork> RaveBrony:
<RaveBrony> :D
<Ninjazz> Hey, Rave.
<flutterchu> wasnt there a pegusister who said she has 20 days to live and wanted this to be messaged ALL OVER THE BRONY WEBSITES
<Ninjazz> Also, Reikim.
<Alchemist> are we about to adopt solipsism?
<RaveBrony> Hiya Barbetos|AtWork and Ninjazz :$
<Jim> ohhh
<killerpony7733> flutterchu Heck if i know and i honestly don't care. People can easily claim something like that to get fame REALLY quick
<Jim> almost life
<Reikim> Oh?
<Reikim> Me?
<flutterchu> killerpony7733: im surprised I SEE NOTHING ABOUT IT NOT EVEN AN EQD POST
<Jim> Been busy with this http://meta.filesmelt.com/downloader.php?file=spongebob-guild-wars-2.gif
<Alchemist> yeah, in this day and age you have to back up what you say...
<Reikim> Ninjazz: Le hm?
<flutterchu> i beleve it's a scam
<Ninjazz> Reikim, twas a le "hai".
<Reikim> Aha
*Reikim goes back to sleep.
<Sylandest> flutterchu: i heard nothing about that at all, so imma go with scam
<Ninjazz> Le gnight then.
<Bronysith> Reikim: guard your anus from molestia or Saturn
<RaveBrony> ._.
<flutterchu> Sylandest: if this isnt a scam........oh boy
<killerpony7733> Sylandest As i said just a quick attempt to gain popularity by playing on peoples sympathy if it ever gets that far
<Reikim|Prereading> Or rather, by sleep I mean work.
<Alchemist> its fishy for someone to say that Ihave 20 days. diseases dont exactly work that way.
<Reikim|Prereading> ...
<Reikim|Prereading> My Internet is broken.
<Reikim|Prereading> I have this but no browsing.
<RaveBrony> Maybe they waited?
<Sylandest> killerpony7733: eeyup
<killerpony7733> Alchemist Techinally it's possible to get a estimated time of when a said illness gets to you but that's about it
<Alchemist> killerpony7733: yeah, an ESTIMATE, but 20 days sounds a bit too specific
<Reikim|Prereading> Oh hey it's back.
<Bronysith> what would happen if i set Reikim|Prereading s fanficiton on fire...
<Reikim|Prereading> And Jim gets a brohoof for being amusing.
<flutterchu> My reaction if it isnt a scam: IM SO SORRRY............I HAD TO http://derpy.me/nGoTW
<Reikim|Prereading> I wouldn't get my prereading done and someone would be very disappointed.
<Reikim|Prereading> On the other hand, I personally will not have to deal with it.
<Vivix> Do you think that would be a valid excuse?
<Alchemist> I wouldnt be sorry for me being a skeptic...
<Vivix> "Sorry, I didn't get it done. Someone set it on fire"
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Reikim|Prereading> My point exactly.
<Reikim|Prereading> On the OTHER hand, if I have an excuse to not get it done, I won't ahve to deal with it.
<Reikim|Prereading> *have
<Jim> (\
<Reikim|Prereading> And that would make me happy indeed.
<Vivix> hehe
<alexxm> back
<Vivix> I wonder how many people get sick when new games come out, and such.
<pony_350537> Cough
<killerpony7733> Vivix Too many from what i know
<flutterchu> Vivix: my brother does it alllllll the time
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> I wonder if it especially affects like gameshops
<Bronysith> gamestop sucks
*Gold_Demona throws pony_350537 a cough drop.
<Vivix> geim shoops
<Bronysith> oh hey Gold_Demona how are you today?
<flutterchu> Bronysith: cant find one better
<killerpony7733> A friend in my class is going to report sick for when Mists of pandaria gets out :S
<Gold_Demona> I'm doing alright, Bronysith. And yourself?
<Bronysith> fine
<Vivix> My sisters boyfriend said he would vanish when it's released
<Bronysith> just gettin ready to grab some awesome lunch
<Reikim|Prereading> I've never called in sick for a game. That sounds...kind of irresponsible?
<Reikim|Prereading> But so is being here.
<Saturn> 08,01the only time i ever did that was for the original Half Life
<Bronysith> Saturn: really?
<flutterchu> killerpony7733: a brother of mine is gonna report sick when black and white 2 come out
<Saturn> 08,01i *really* enjoyed that game when i was 12
<Vivix> I've never done it either, but- I am a terrible liar
<Vivix> you stayed home from school?
<Reikim|Prereading> On the other hand, when I got Brawl, I literally shut down everything else for about a week while I beat Subspace Emissary.
<Gold_Demona> Me too Vivix
<Alchemist> I've never reported sick for a game. skipped some chores, sure, but never reported sick.
<Bronysith> the only time i took a day off for a game, i still got all my work done before the day it came out
<Bronysith> wrath of the lich king of course
<Saturn> 08,01flutterchu: er, hasnt tha been out for years?
<Reikim|Prereading> Nope Saturn
<Alchemist> it has
<BroHoof> Saturn: dat was a long friggin' time ago 12!
<Vivix> but I have BW2
<flutterchu> THE WII-U WILL BE COMING HERE TO AMERICA AT NOVEMBER STARTING 299.00$
<Reikim|Prereading> Actually Saturn, yes and no.
<Gold_Demona> Saturn: Black and White 2? It's not out yet
<Reikim|Prereading> Saturn: He's referring to the Pokemon games, not the Black and White series.
<Vivix> Black and White 2 is ancient- is this a different black and white? Or is it a joke?
<flutterchu> Gold_Demona: wait IT IS OUT
<Saturn> 08,01BroHoof: about 13 years ago
<BroHoof> Saturn: damn
<Vivix> I was..
<Vivix> in 1998 I was..9
<Gold_Demona> Pokemon Black and White 2
<Vivix> it was the first game I bought on my own
<Alchemist> http://www.gamespot.com/black-and-white-2/
<Vivix> half life, that is
<Saturn> 08,01Gold_Demona: oh
<Alchemist> oh
<BroHoof> Vivix: lol i was 1 x)
<Saturn> 08,01i thought ou meant Black and Whote
<Vivix> !
<Reikim|Prereading> Whote?
<Bronysith> 13 minutes till black mesa source
<Reikim|Prereading> Is that some new colour?
*Vivix shudders happily
<Gold_Demona> Saturn: I have no idea what that is. :P
<Alchemist> and then server crash
<Saturn> 08,01*white
<Gold_Demona> I only know of Pokemon Black and White
<Vivix> really?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hello everyone :)
<Vivix> Black and white was the BEST god game out there
<Reikim|Prereading> Shizuka: I'm guessing that after BMN tonight we're going straight to Black Mesa, huh? :P
<RaveBrony> Hey MLP_Brovakiin :)
<Vivix> like...I played that for weeeks
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: the non pokemon black and white wasnt that bad
<Gold_Demona> What's it about?
<Vivix> Populus the beginning, and black and white, best god games from my childhood
<flutterchu> GODAMMIT I MEAN POKEMON BLACK AND WHITE 2
<Vivix> You're a god, that needs to help your people to prosper-
<Reikim|Prereading> Anyway about ranting.
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Like Sim City and Civilization?
<flutterchu> POKEMON
<Vivix> kiinda but--different gameplay
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: its more like a building game. Strategic, you play as a god and you have to conquer other people either by force or by religion
<Maid_RainBow> Sim Citty 3000
<Reikim|Prereading> Just dealing with some atrocious use of the English language here.
<Vivix> yeah- and it was pretty inovative back then, I think-
<Gold_Demona> Alchemist: So... Like Civilization. :P
<Reikim|Prereading> On top of that, I've got a pretty bad plot to deal with.
<Vivix> you're not in direct control thoguh
<Maid_RainBow> i loved Sim City
<Reikim|Prereading> I may be required to vent.
<Gold_Demona> Ah
<Vivix> it's--hard to explain
<Gold_Demona> So you can't select the people and make them do stuff?
<Vivix> you control your god, and your god creature, and kinda--people pray to you and you can tell them to build stuff-
<Gold_Demona> It's one of those things where you control the world to influence what the people do, right?
<Alchemist> Gold_Demona: yes, but its not turn based, and has a different style and more open ended considering constructing cities
<Vivix> you can't select individual people, but you can pick up people and give them a "divine calling"
<Vivix> yeah-
<Vivix> and like all Lionhead games, you can be bliterhingly evil, or shining goodness
<Gold_Demona> Interesting. I may have to look into this. I like games like that
<Jmo> Black and White 2?
<Gold_Demona> But I'm also looking forward to Pokemon Black and White 2. It comes out next month. :3
<BroHoof> Vivix: that black and white game confuses me >_< i play from dust kinda like it
<Alchemist> also, jerking the mouse in all directions possible for a fraking miracle...
<Vivix> I liked from dust, yeah- very neat game
<Vivix> yeah you use mouse gestures to call miracles and stuff
<Meanwhile> Sounds lovely.
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Alchemist> Vivix: but for me it was buggy, some miracles was a pain to gesture
<Vivix> and, what I thought was the coolest, your only physical interaction with things outside your belief range- is your creature, and you have to train him
<Meanwhile> Right, was called on to clean rodents, what's going on now?
<Vivix> and if you don't train him, you can't really complete the game
<Vivix> true- I could do most of them, but sometimes it took me a while
<Alchemist> yeah, you can train it to eat citizens
<Alchemist> or tress
<Vivix> yeah
<Alchemist> *trees
<Reikim|Prereading> First off
<Reikim|Prereading> TwiLuna.
<Vivix> and catch rocks when you throw it at him
<Reikim|Prereading> Apparently this is a ship that happens.
<Vivix> or just beat him up with the rocks-
<Alchemist> or to be a builder or gatherer or soldier etc
<Vivix> yeah
<alexxm> i find it confusing in games like that you can only be a paragon of viture or a complete monster with no middle ground
<Reikim|Prereading> Also Celestia can get involved, making a love triangle.
<Vivix> well in BM you can be kinda middle I think
<Vivix> I was a few times-
<Alchemist> alexxm: here its gradual so there is a middle ground
<Vivix> it only really changes your eh..interaction with your population and the way you look
<Meanwhile> If you're questioning TwiLuna I wonder if you've even interacted with the fandom you're part of.
<killerpony7733> 7 minutes!
<MaxTheBrony> heya :)
<Vivix> Woo!
<Vivix> Hiya MaxTheBrony
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai Vivix !
<alexxm> Alchemist ok but in most games like that it isn't at least in my experiance
<Reikim|Prereading> I interact with it but I reserve the right to question its sanity.
<BroHoof> some how in B&W 2 i never got that fountain to be water always fire ._.
<Vivix> Hehe
<alexxm> how are things MaxTheBrony
<Reikim|Prereading> If it were a crack pairing, and treated as such, then that would be okay.
<Reikim|Prereading> But taking it seriously?
<Alchemist> yeah I think you can get mana or resources by sacrificing people, thats NOt going for the good side of the scale :D
<Vivix> I thouht I was being good, protecting my city with fire and brimstone, and then suddenly I was evil <,<
<MaxTheBrony> Its all good here , How are things at you alexxm :)
<Meanwhile> There is no rule of shipping that I'm aware of, but it's pretty much the same as R34, nothing is sacred and there are no exceptions.
<alexxm> i'm good MaxTheBrony
<BroHoof> Vivix: lol same here x)
<Gold_Demona> lol, Evil is as evil does, Vivix
<Vivix> hehe
<Reikim|Prereading> And here I thought I'd seen everything.
<Reikim|Prereading> Question for you, grammar-guru.
<Vivix> I think it was because fire makes your enemy suffer- and that's not good
<Reikim|Prereading> How should numbers be written out?
<BroHoof> Vivix: it made me feel like i was raisin' hell over those ppl xD
<Vivix> yeaahh
<Alchemist> you can give people a divine call to... erm... "get busy" if you know what I mean.
<Vivix> It was the most powerful attack I knew in BW2, so I used it all the time
<Meanwhile> For story purpose, depends on the context.
<Vivix> Alchemist, oh yeaah
<Reikim|Prereading> Personally I've always erred on the side of word form (e.g. one thousand) but is it wrong, technically, to use the number form (1000)?
<Vivix> "God told me to make love to you all!"
<flutterchu> http://derpy.me/-YprE :D
<Alchemist> it was awesome! :D
<Bronysith> 3 MINUTES
<prince-dari> Till what?
<Reikim|Prereading> "God has told me to have children. Whelp, better get on that then."
<Alchemist> I also loved the music and side quests
<Vivix> Also because of the destruction engine, I liked to accidentally break houses <,<
<Reikim|Prereading> prince-dari: Black Mesa.
<Bronysith> prince-dari: till i set you on fire
<prince-dari> Oh
<Meanwhile> If you were reading the text as the story you should use the word form, if you were reading a text within the story itself you would use whatever best paints the image you're trying to convey.
<prince-dari> Meh
<prince-dari> :O
<BroHoof> flutterchu: lol he's sittin there like :C
<Jmo> dabi pls
<Bronysith> http://www.blackmesasource.com prince-dari
<prince-dari> jaymoo no u
<Reikim|Prereading> Thanks. It's good to know I haven't been wrong all this time.
<Jmo> <3
<Meanwhile> For example, "The note reads '1 17 2 5'"
<Alchemist> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdKuNtV9WbM
<flutterchu> what's gordon
<Reikim|Prereading> I see.
<Vivix> In the test chaaambeer
<Reikim|Prereading> Good, I'll make sure to note that.
<BroHoof> Vivix: "accidentally" ? u sure xP
<Maid_RainBow> i heared that season 3 will start in october ^^
<Vivix> <,<.. that's what I told their insurance company
<prince-dari> if i dint wub u jaymoo i wuld kil u
<Reikim|Prereading> But back to ship-rants.
<Jmo> :>
<flutterchu> Alchemist: GODAMMIT POKEMON BLACK AND WHITE 2 I WAS TALKING ABOUT
<Reikim|Prereading> A love triangle between Celestia, Luna and Twilight.
<BroHoof> Vivix: ahaha:D
<killerpony7733> Maid_RainBow YOU heard yes but no official date has been announced
<Vivix> We know flutterchu but we started talking about bw
<Meanwhile> I can probably google that and get several pages worth of fics.
<killerpony7733> So try to not set yourself up for disappointment
<Alchemist> flutterchu: I know, but we were talking about the other one in the last 15 minutes
<flutterchu> Vivix: -_(\
<Maid_RainBow> i hopr it will be 13 oct
<XAX> 2 MINUTES
<Reikim|Prereading> But none of them are good.
<flutterchu> what the hell is gordon?
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/Cv9JU.png
<Vivix> main character
<Reikim|Prereading> It's not even bloody justified, it's just /there/.
<Bronysith> 60 SECONDS
<RaveBrony> Uuuugh. Why is that Deus Ex collection on sale Again! Steam needs other selections :[
<Vivix> Yaarrr
<Reikim|Prereading> Twilestia on its own simply breaks my mind in two.
<BroHoof> i dont want december to come ._.
<Meanwhile> Remind me to find you that Luna/Applejack fic.
<killerpony7733> 1 minute
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu: What do you mean what's Gordon?
<RaveBrony> Why?
<flutterchu> BroHoof: ohhh i <3 cristmas
<XAX> T-MINUS ONE MINUTE
<BroHoof> Meanwhile: that's creepy
<Reikim|Prereading> I know it all exists.
<Vivix> I love December- cold though, and sun goes down at 1600
<Reikim|Prereading> It's just...unjustified.
<flutterchu> Gold_Demona: it said 3 minutes until gordon what's that?
<Maid_RainBow> fluttechu : /) brohoof
<BroHoof> flutterchu: ur lucky u celebrate it atleast xP
<killerpony7733> 20 seconds!
<Reikim|Prereading> I question whether or not people /think/ before pairing characters.
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu: I'm assuming Gordon Freeman from Half Life
<killerpony7733> and 10
<Gold_Demona> I could be wrong tho
<Reikim|Prereading> The answer thus far has been "nope".
<Alchemist> 40 seconds for me
<killerpony7733> and go!
<XAX> 5
<XAX> 4
<XAX> 3
<XAX> 2
<XAX> 1
<Alchemist> but it will crash regardless :D
<Ninjazz> HAPPY NEW YEAR!

<flutterchu> i dont think they announced a new half life
<Meanwhile> Quite right.
<killerpony7733> 403 forbidden wut
<Ninjazz> LOL.
<Vivix> 403!
<killerpony7733> I knew it they got bombarded

<Reikim|Prereading> I HAVE NO CONNECTION!
<RaveBrony> For what?
<killerpony7733> I'm in but black screen~
<flutterchu> Gold_Demona: im not trying to watch it
<Meanwhile> It's become my favourite image.
<BroHoof> Gold_Demona: if stream then yes
<Reikim|Prereading> I'm probably not going to get Black Mesa until a week from now...
<Gold_Demona> flutterchu, it's not a video. It's a website
<Gold_Demona> blackmesasource.com
<Bronysith> still offline for me lol
<Vivix> We're probably crushing the server
<flutterchu> Gold_Demona: ?????
<Meanwhile> What's blackscreened?
<RaveBrony> Dunno
<Reikim|Prereading> What, no love for Starship Troopers' many buffer moments?
<Vivix> a blank black screen
<Gold_Demona> Nope. site's still blackscreen
<Meanwhile> What site?
<flutterchu> bye
*Vivix shakes
<RaveBrony> Some game thing
<Gold_Demona> blackmesasource.com
<Jim> oh god I'm glad I don't read those kinds of fics
<Meanwhile> Oh, don't care.
<Reikim|Prereading> Meanwhile: Black Mesa. HL1 rewritten for Source.
<RaveBrony> Meanwhile: Nor do i :D
<Meanwhile> Yeah I've heard of it, not interested.
<Reikim|Prereading> Good for you.
<Snow> hi everypony ^^
<Reikim|Prereading> Don't worry about it, though.
<Meanwhile> There are far too many buffers for lagship troopers.
<Bronysith> maybe when i get back it will be ready
<Gold_Demona> Hiya Snow
<RaveBrony> Hey Snow :P
<Meanwhile> 16, I think.
<killerpony7733> Their servers must be bombarded with all the constant refreshing and all
<alexxm> how are things Snow
<BroHoof> hiya Snow
<Reikim|Prereading> Should compile them and dro
<Vivix> yeah we're probably killing it
<Reikim|Prereading> *compile them into one neat little package.
<Jmo> Hai Snow
<Reikim|Prereading> Stupid twitchy fingers.
<Ninjazz> Like a dropship of images.
<Ninjazz> Do ho ho, comedy.
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/Mdj1t.jpg
<Snow> how's it going here?
<Phase4> 00,02ololololo
<Phase4> 00,02black mesa source site has bugs
<Gold_Demona> Eeyup
<Gold_Demona> Black screen of blackness
<Ninjazz> Give the poor team a chance.
<Ninjazz> They ain't no Valve.
<Hat> Man Black Mesa is excellent
<Phase4> 00,02the cloudflare 'is offline' page is being appended to the normal page
<Ninjazz> And we're treating them like Valve.
<Phase4> 00,02and the normal one is broken
<Hat> Anyone played the first level yet?
<RaveBrony> :D
<Meanwhile> Part of me is hoping it turns out Black Mesa is just an elaborate troll virus.
<Hat> I couldn't believe it when a headcrab got the gman
<Gold_Demona> Hat: We can't get to the website yet. :P
<Ninjazz> That's a good one.
<Gold_Demona> Man, I hope not. I like Half Life. :<
<Phase4> 00,02wait nvm, the append was just a derp (i clicked wrong thing)
<Phase4> 00,02page is just broke
*Reikim|Prereading has no browsing. Again.
<Vivix> yeah-
<Meanwhile> Frankly I think the best one that came out of it was the one at the end. http://i.imgur.com/JwwqF.jpg
<Ninjazz> That made me lol.
<Gold_Demona> I wonder when it'll come out on Steam
*Reikim|Prereading throws hands in the air
<Ninjazz> Ah 'Gine monster.
<Vivix> Who knows- hopefully soon
<Ninjazz> 'Gina*
<Ninjazz> You ugly.
<Hat> How is it's Greenlight page going
<Vivix> approved and contacted by valve to figure out details
<Reikim|Prereading> Black Mesa is free, yes?
<Vivix> even if approoved by greenlight valve can turn you down, or the dev can turn the terms down
<Vivix> yeah
<Phase4> 00,02these guys obviously have the same problems bronystate had
<Vivix> it's illegal to sell it
<Barbetos|AtWork> Black Mesa has become 403 Forbidden.
<Phase4> 00,02sheer damned load
<Vivix> yeah~~
<Gold_Demona> Oh! I got something!
<Gold_Demona> A load bar!
<Vivix> !
*Vivix jealously watches
<Gold_Demona> On the website! I refreshed and got a loadbar
<Gold_Demona> And it works! 8D
*Maid_RainBow hugs Vivix
*Vivix holds on to Maid_RainBow
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, its started wroking here too it seems
<Phase4> 00,02SLOW
<Phase4> 00,02but working
*Vivix got time out
<Gold_Demona> They've still got some kinks to work out, but they're getting it. =)
<Reikim|Prereading> asdf
<Reikim|Prereading> I have to stop and I barely got...
<Reikim|Prereading> Maybe a page done?
<Hat> http://release.blackmesasource.com/pages/download_manager.html#
<Ninjazz> Doing a fic?
<Meanwhile> Progress is progress.
<Reikim|Prereading> Editing.
<Reikim|Prereading> See my tag?
<Ninjazz> Mmmm.
<Reikim|Prereading> Oh god I've got two thousand words of this.
<Reikim|Prereading> And that's the first chapter.
<Jim> That's quite impressive
<Ninjazz> That reminds me that I should go back and edit my old fic from way back when.
<Reikim|Prereading> I'm not writing it, I'm editing it.
<Reikim|Prereading> And it /hurts/.
<Meanwhile> Given Rei's tendency to get lumped with bad fics, I imagine it's quite painful.
<Alchemist> yay http://derpy.me/ddDJ0
<Ninjazz> Lol.
<Reikim|Prereading> You'd think I'd have built up a resistance to it by now.
<Reikim|Prereading> Noooooooo
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/F5zd7.jpg
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So... how 'bout dat black mesa?
*Vivix pushes Scoot-Scootaloo
<killerpony7733> YEEEEES got a download going!!
<Vivix> !
<killerpony7733> Or not...
<Ninjazz> My face, all day every day.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I don't know what's the deal with black colored tables :S
<killerpony7733> File providers are getting shelled too
<XAX> GUYS
<XAX> http://www.mediafire.com/?ba8kfb4xu4jjvna
<Reikim|Prereading> I hope this isn't indicative of a masochistic streak or something.
<XAX> ^ THERE
<XAX> It's the torrent link from release.blackmesa
<Vivix> D=
<Reikim|Prereading> But really, just looking at this.
<Alchemist> is this game free?
*Reikim|Prereading shoots self
<Jmo> 3GB.
<Hat> Yes
<Vivix> yes
<Ninjazz> Do you read "bad fics" and scoff at them? Or do you actually enjoy them?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I suppose i'll DL it when I get back home. BRB <3
*Meanwhile casts revive on Reikim.
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Alchemist> then I might give it a try. Im broke atm
<Phase4> 00,02oh neat they have a torrent option
<Reikim|Prereading> People say "my fic sucks help"
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Someone link me a DL page when I get back, k? :$
<Reikim|Prereading> I say "FINE".
<Vivix> kaai
<Phase4> 00,02if you guys want i'll link the torrent
<Alchemist> or torrent
<Reikim|Prereading> And then I hate myself forever after.
<killerpony7733> Alchemist If you got Source SDK 2007 you can easily play it or any source game
<XAX> do.
<Jmo> wut
<Gold_Demona> Don't you have to have the Source SDK installed to play it?
<Vivix> XAX realsies?
<XAX> i'm not getting much from the torrent i'm trying
<Vivix> SDK 2007 yeah
<killerpony7733> Gold_Demona That or a source GAME
<Ninjazz> So that's why you're tag is that. You're an actual prereader.
<Meanwhile> Can't you just say "Yeah it really does suck, I can't do a thing with it."
<Hat> I liked Goldeneye Source
<Gold_Demona> I have both, so I'm set. :P
<Vivix> you need SDK 2007 specifically I think-
<Vivix> greenlight page has requirements
<Reikim|Prereading> Oh, probably, but some twisted bit of my psyche says I can't.
<Barbetos|AtWork> The torrent option is not working! D=
<Barbetos|AtWork> Panic!!
<Phase4> 00,02the site that distributes the torrent is down
<Reikim|Prereading> It's a hellish combination of "too nice to do so" and "this is obviously a challenge" and "grammar nazi says MUST FIX NOW".
<Phase4> 00,02this is anoying
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/pzdBz.jpg
<Vivix> damn
<killerpony7733> Figures
<Reikim|Prereading> Anyway, I'm off.
<Phase4> 00,02if anyone can get the torrent hash i might be able to scrape it via dht
<Dken2021> what kind of illegal activities are you guys up to now?
<killerpony7733> Also i managed to punch through the main page
<Phase4> 00,02Dken2021, black mesa source has a torrent option
<killerpony7733> I got through and got a download link again
<Dken2021> meaning?
<Meanwhile> Frankly I hope none of you ever get it downloaded, just so I can point and laugh.
<Ninjazz> Crazy bastard.
*Vivix pouts at Meanwhile
*Ninjazz manly tear.
<Dken2021> free stuff I guess
<Vivix> yeah
<XAX> release.blackmesa is a blank page atm
<XAX> for me
<killerpony7733> Well that and any of the file providers are getting shelled to death by it
<Meanwhile> Quite.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Why u no set up more mirrors BMS?
<Barbetos|AtWork> D=
<Gold_Demona> I'm getting zero activity from this torrent. O_o
<Barbetos|AtWork> Same
<Dken2021> so what's special about it? some new props for SFM?
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, you has it?
<Wrek> 05gona get me some kebab tonight
<Barbetos|AtWork> Dken2021: nuuh. Its a remake of the first Half Life, and it looks amazing.
<Meanwhile> It's a remake of Half Life apparently.
<Gold_Demona> Yes Phase4 I has it and it's opened on my Bittorrent, but there's no download activity going on
<Wrek> 05gona be fantastic
<XAX> Phase4: http://www.mediafire.com/?ba8kfb4xu4jjvna
<Gold_Demona> That's where I got it from ^
<Ninjazz> And chat is full of Half lifes and kebabs.
<Dken2021> Barbetos|AtWork ooh, does it have a new engine or it's just the old one dressed up pretty?
<Ninjazz> Wonderful.
<Ninjazz> Ohey, Dken2021.
<Phase4> 00,02if i can make my vps boot i'll put the torrent on there
<Jmo> Wait, aren't you suppose to be asleep phase?
<Meanwhile> Never played the original Half Life, never wanted to either.
<Phase4> 00,02an extra gigabit of bandwidth cant hurt
<Gold_Demona> Dken2021: It's completely remade using the Source engine
<Wrek> 05ill seed this torrent for a day
<Dken2021> ello there Ninjazz
<Phase4> 00,02Jmo, >_>
<Jmo> <_<
<Wrek> 053gb shouldnt take too long
<XAX> If anyone knows how to Magnet, magnet:?xt=urn:btih:VG2UNOAUDQQQQ4GOBHCDAOFGV3U6AFL7&dn=BlackMesa&tr=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gameupdates.org%2fannounce.php
<Dken2021> ah, so it's still using that 2000 engine
<Ninjazz> Meanwhile, why not? It's got a reputation behind it.
<Vivix> Not everything is for everyone
<Ninjazz> That is actually legit for once.
<Wrek> 05btw was black mesa source a f2p thing?
<Vivix> just how I can't stand FF
<Meanwhile> So has polio Ninjazz.
<Gold_Demona> Dken2021 It requires Source SDK 2007
<Vivix> It's free yes
<Ninjazz> Polio isn't fun, though.
<Wrek> 05torrent is dead so
<killerpony7733> So gamefront directs you to it's main page now. The middle one has 403 forbidden
<XAX> Wrek: Free remake of HL1 on source engine.
<Vivix> selling BMS would be illegal
<Wrek> 05ill give it an hour to kick in
<killerpony7733> torrent heck if i know
<Phase4> 00,02aw crap
<Wrek> 05Vivix: thats what i thought
<Phase4> 00,02Gold_Demona, its because the tracker is down
<Wrek> 05but was unsire
<Meanwhile> Aye but really, I've never cared about Half Life as a franchise and I'm not about to start now.
<Dken2021> oh
<Wrek> 05torrents are legal
<Wrek> 05as logn as the content is legal
<Phase4> 00,02this is what dht is designed to solve
<XAX> The release page is working for me now...
<Vivix> Indeed
<Phase4> 00,02but they disabled dht
<Jmo> So much activity.
<Jmo> LOUD NOISES.
<XAX> But the 3 mirrors are still down.
<Phase4> 00,02which is stupid for free content
<Vivix> So many nerds sitting up at night trying to download
<Vivix> Aww- and yeah I get no contact from any of the mirrors- hoping the torrent will kick in
<Gold_Demona> It's late morning for me. :P
<Unnr|Laptop> Ohai all
<Dken2021> if only they had more mirrors
<killerpony7733> XAX One goes directly to the main page of the site and the middle is just 403 forbidden and torrents are derped atm
<Phase4> 00,02Vivix, cant untill the tracker comes back up
<Hat> Magnets, how do they work?
<Dken2021> hey Unnr|Laptop
<Phase4> 00,02they chose a stupid provider
<Phase4> 00,02Hat, magnet links or actual magnets?
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Unnr|Laptop
<Vivix> damn-
<Barbetos|AtWork> Meanwhile: it looks like you will get to finally live your fantasy and laugh at the misfortune of Bronystaters.... again.
<Hat> Phase4 there's no difference right
<Phase4> 00,02actual magnets are bloody strange, i'm taking a class that teaches me how they work
<Ninjazz> Seeing as how alot of Ponychat is like this, I wonder how other parts of the Internet is fairing.
<Gold_Demona> They work on magic. :D
<Jmo> ^
<Vivix> Also, damn irc client, when you mods ping me it does not work.
*Meanwhile mocks chat.
<twilight_sprinklenap> Phase4: theres an entire class for that? i thought it was just cause the electrons move the same so their electromagnetic fields dont cancel out
<Jim> Chat needs more Indian Stallone http://i.imgur.com/K9b90.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02twilight_sprinklenap, its the 'electrical machines' class
<Ninjazz> G'morning, twilight_sprinklenap.

<Ninjazz> MadSurge, I just tend to think every black individual is a born comedian.
<Meanwhile> Fahr.
<Kandarihu|OldComp> Most cats don't pay attention to images on a screen. My late cat Anna would sometimes try to pounce at onscreen sprites, sometimes.
<PillowPoni|Phone> Is that the remix or the original?
<Ninjazz> Ld. Jesusofar.
<ArcherJoe11> Hey, everypony

<Dken2021> I feel like i've been shortened a few years
<Ninjazz> And now I'm fat as a pig.
<Ninjazz> Goddamnit.
<PillowPoni|Phone> What's on stream?
<Ninjazz> Wonderful ideas.
<Barbetos|AtWork> And tits
<Meanwhile> Aint nobody got time for wonderful ideas jeezus.
<MadSurge> Uuum
<MadSurge> Oh, more Heroes .__.
<Meanwhile> Cliffhangers, the series.
<PillowPoni|Phone> Oh god, Heroes is on stream??!!
<Agrold> haven't seen heroes in a long time:3
<MadSurge> Meanwhile: I heard Gundam 00 had it as much as bad :D
<SploogeTheFish> Yeah...I think i should run off to play some ratchet and clank
<SploogeTheFish> Cya guise
<SafariMonkey> Oh I haven't watched heroes, is it good?
<gold_demona_> Aha! Got a working torrent! Somebody on Facebook posted it.
<Ninjazz> Like your life depends on it, SploogeTheFish.
<prince-dari> Heroes is brilliant
<prince-dari> Well S1 anyway
<Ninjazz> Lost was bettar.
<Barbetos|AtWork> gold_demona_: share it?
<prince-dari> Meh Ninjazz
<Kandarihu|OldComp> SafariMonkey, for the first season. It starts going downhill with each successive season though.
<Agrold> Hiro is best hero
<PillowPoni|Phone> Oh god, whyy does my computer have to be deeeead?
<Ninjazz> I didn't watch either too much anyways, Dari.
<Ninjazz> But I liked Lost because I live on a island and I can relate with the story. ;_;
<SafariMonkey> prince-dari: I only heard bad things. (probably later seasons) Is it worth watching?
<prince-dari> S1 is definitely worth watching
<prince-dari> It's brilliant
<Ninjazz> But Heroes got pretty confusing after a while.
<Vivix> I saw S1 on TV and loved it, kinda got bored during S2
<Meanwhile> Power of schizo.
<alexxm> since when was schizophernia a super power
<prince-dari> Well, her 'other half' literally rips people in half
<Vivix> The power of DID!
<Meanwhile> Technically it's not schizophrenia, it's MPD.
<prince-dari> So it's more than just that.
<Vivix> DID or MPD yeah, Schizo tend not to have multiple personalities ithink
*Vivix noot sure-
<SafariMonkey> prince-dari: And it's self-contained enough not to leave me frustrated at the end, knowing I can't watch the rest because it's rubbish or whatever?
<prince-dari> Yeah
<prince-dari> S1 has a pretty conclusive end IIRC
<Dken2021> welp, gotta go, have soem stuff to do, bye
<Saturn> 08,01yo
<Unnr|Laptop> Ohai Saturn!~
<Unnr|Laptop> o/

<Gold_Demona> http://www.mediafire.com/?khmzyygg4vetko0
<prince-dari> I can skip ahead
<PillowPoni|Phone> Hi Saturn
<Unnr|Laptop> Season 1 of Heroes was pretty good. The rest... Meh.

<Meanwhile> Last one I remember was the fight with...watshisname.

<Gold_Demona> Sylar
<Saturn> 08,01
<Meanwhile> Yeah that prick.

<Saturn> 08,01oooooh heroes!
<Saturn> 08,01<3 dari
<prince-dari> <:
<Unnr|Laptop> Saturn: You got between grad students and free food? You mad?
<Meanwhile> Yeah that's right.
<Meanwhile> YOU CAN'T SEE ME I'M INVISIBLE.
<Agrold> wait.. Eccleston played in Heroes:O I didn't know that
<prince-dari> I'll check
<Vivix> Using the BMS new trackers torrent from Facebook gives me 0.1kbps!
<Lil_B> Saturn I have a question!! My scottish english teacher told us 2 shottish sayings. Can you say "It's a braw bricht moonlicht nicht the nicht." ?
<prince-dari> >nicht
<prince-dari> German? Wut
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: aye
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: nicht = 'night' in scottish; 'no' in german
<Vivix> I keep imagining Saturn in different ways- now I see him with a huge bearda nd kilt
<Lil_B> prince-dari that's how he wrote it on the chalkboard :/
<prince-dari> Oh yeah, Hiro and the t-rex
<Lil_B> Saturn and "Mony a mickle maks a mukle" He said that british people can't say these sentences
<MadSurge> Saturn: what a strange g you have :D
<prince-dari> Dat Eccleston
<Meanwhile> Eccleston. <3
<PillowPoni|Phone> Who?
<Lil_B> appearently shottich people look more like germans than brits
<prince-dari> The skipping is because I was opening some page
<prince-dari> And it always lags when I open it
<prince-dari> Ok
<Meanwhile> Yeah this is where we were up to, in any case.
<prince-dari> Nikki turned herself in to the police last ep I think
<Saz> Oh my Gah, what is this that I'm watching?
<Meanwhile> Heroes.
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: that's right
<Saz> Oh my.

<killerpony7733> Wrek meh....i don't care i can wait
<killerpony7733> I just don't like torrent
<Moopy> Well im just saying though gosh
<prince-dari> Dat Mr Muggles

<Lil_B> Vivix ok, I'm torrenting it now too, but I'll probably not going to upload good XD mx 50kbit/s up I think
<prince-dari> And back to best hero
<Vivix> Hehe, the more the merrier
<Unnr|Laptop> Do the hatian sounds like a sketchy 60´s surf-rock dance

<prince-dari> Yep, she always found a way of making some money
<Sundaysmile> bowchickabowwow
<Saturn> 08,01i once considered being a male prostitute
<prince-dari> Saturn wut
<XAX> I'm busy downloading BM:S, and watching Hot Fuzz while it dooes so.
<Saturn> 08,01prince-dari: when i had a better figure, obviously
<XAX> Saturn: What a legitimate career choice.
<Saturn> 08,01XAX: not as a career; just to get some money so i wouldn't be evicted
<XAX> I see.
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, hell... i like sex, i like money...
<Saturn> 08,01i'm good at it too
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos
<Jmo> >__>
<Vivix> Weren't you homeless for a short while too?
<Saturn> 08,01yup
<Vivix> I think your life could be a nice novel
<Unnr|Laptop> Wow, lady gaga is actually kind of a cool person
<Unnr|Laptop> Sees twitter user doing sketches of her > offers artist a job on personal creative team
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr|Laptop: she really is; vocally talented too. unfortunately, over-produced and not really my kind of music
<Gold_Demona> My IRC keeps derping...
<Vivix> Lady Gaga is nice, just not my type of music-yeah
<kinixys> Her last album was inspired by MLP.
<prince-dari> And den Sylar was ded
<Vivix> There was a girl on Norwegian Melodi grand prix with a giant my little pony necklace, like one of the biiig dolls covered in rimstones and hung around her neck
<Unnr|Laptop> Saturn: its still nice to see pop-artists not being complete and total asshats to their fans.
<Meanwhile> But not really.
<Vivix> and she was a mlp fan- probably gen 1 fan too
<Saturn> 08,01Unnr|Laptop: aye
<kinixys> Yes. Gen1
<Vivix> You saw her too?
<Unnr|Laptop> Okies, see everyone later. Its puppy o´clock
<Unnr|Laptop> o/
<Vivix> seeyaa
<Barbetos|AtWork> puppy o'clock?
<Saturn> 08,01see you Unnr|Laptop <3
<Barbetos|AtWork> Bye Unnr|Laptop
<Unnr|Laptop> Barbetos|AtWork: making some extra money dog-sitting, tis time for their run.
<Vivix> Ah nice
<Barbetos|AtWork> AH.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Caps are fun
<Barbetos|AtWork> =P
<Vivix> hey weren't we supposed to ping someone when torrent worked?
*Vivix scrolls
<Vivix> Apparently HydraIRC won't let you scroll very far back
<gold_demona_> Hmm
<Vivix> was it phase?..
<gold_demona_> I forget
<Barbetos|AtWork> Probably was
<Vivix> Phase4 were we supposed to ping you?
<Vivix> If he's sleeping, we'll get such a trashing
<Vivix> Man that download is really beating your internet, huh?
<Barbetos|AtWork> D=
<Gold_Demona> Yes it is
<Gold_Demona> Torrents tend to do that to me, which is why I usually avoid them. =/
<Vivix> It's gonna be woorth it in the eend
<Vivix> ah yeah-
<Barbetos|AtWork> Limit the upload speed, that might help Gold_Demona

<Panda|Sorting> Had no idea cunts were lovable.
<shana> so is anyone going to stream black mesa source?
<Meanwhile> I hope not.
<Panda|Sorting> ^
<shana> because spoilers?
<Panda|Sorting> No.
<Meanwhile> Because I don't care about it.
<Dark92Enigma> Hello i'm back.........and boy am i pissed off
<Dark92Enigma> SPONGEBOB! :D
<DaringDerpy> hi bronies
<Panda|Sorting> Meanwhile, why does it seems we end up agreeing on the most random of things?
<Barbetos|AtWork> worth it
<Dark92Enigma> Anyway, i'm pissed off as f**k :|
<ArcherJoe11> hey DaringDerpy
<Meanwhile> I don't know Panda.
<kinixys> hi DaringDerpy.
<alexxm> how are things DaringDerpy
<ArcherJoe11> why that Dark92Enigma
<Barbetos|AtWork> Oh I know who made this video. I love this guy
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo DaringDerpy
<DaringDerpy> things are alright, alexxm
<Panda|Sorting> Meanwhile, we need to converse more.
<alexxm> what happened Dark92Enigma
<Dark92Enigma> ArcherJoe11 alexxm did YOU guys get the newsletter?
<Meanwhile> Panda: Indeed. But it'll probably turn out we only share a hatred of Nintendo and an uncaring attitude towards Half Life.
<alexxm> yeah Dark92Enigma
<ArcherJoe11> yes
<Barbetos|AtWork> Find waldo knife to jaw.
<ArcherJoe11> today that is
<Dark92Enigma> I TRIED TO, alexxm ArcherJoe11 but THEY WON'T LET ME SIGN MY E-MAIL
<Meanwhile> I got the newsletter.
<Saturn> 08,01hmm
<Saturn> 08,01you know what i should do
<Panda|Sorting> Meanwhile, some how I doubt that. Many times when 2 people share a couple commonalities, they tend to share more.
<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile and you used a DIFFERENT E-MAIL TO DO SO????
<DaringDerpy> i got the newsletter to the spam folder this week
<Saturn> 08,01i shouhld give Koen a surprise visit on Valentine's Day
<DaringDerpy> they probably used some banned words
<Saturn> 08,01just randomly turn up at his
<Meanwhile> Dark92Enigma: Nope, same email I've always used.
<Saturn> 08,01only problem is that it's on a Tuesday
<Saturn> 08,01and total travel time is about 5 - 6 hours each way
<Saturn> 08,01actualy, more than that including trains
<PillowPoni|Phone> Saturn: school on Tuesdays?
<Saturn> 08,01but yeah, i think it'd be quite romantic to just make an impromptu international flight and turn up with some flowers
<Meanwhile> Plan that for just a random day and it's more romantic.
<Dark92Enigma> Meanwhile: I didn't get a message on my Hotmail, i tried to get in with my name and last name.....and all i get is : The email you used has already been registered.You must be registered to complete this survey
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Saturn> 08,01i think i will
<Meanwhile> Dark92Enigma: Well that sucks for you then.
<Barbetos|AtWork> So many operations
<Dark92Enigma> Where do i re-sign?? At least on Twitter and Facebook, they let me in, but i don't know where to ''re-assume'' my account
<MadSurge> Dat Dr Who! :D
<Dark92Enigma> Dr Who.......helps me to calm my anger
<somepony_else> what is the name of this song?
<Dark92Enigma> only for a while
<prince-dari> Doctor Who Gallifreyan Buccaneer
<alexxm> i remember the reboot version of this
<somepony_else> thanks, prince-dari
<Panda|Sorting> Dark92Enigma, you realize you can use a different email. Right?
<Dark92Enigma> Panda|Sorting: yes, but what if i run out of emails?
<Dark92Enigma> why use a different e-mail?
<dr-whooves> Hey guys...
<Jmo> lolrunoutofemails
<ArcherJoe11> hey dr-whooves
<Panda|Sorting> Dark92Enigma, how can you run out of emails. The amount of emails there can be on the internet are nearly infinite.
<Meanwhile> Tennantface.jpg
<Dark92Enigma> If Meanwhile can use the same e mail why some other don't? THIS MAKES AS MUCH SENSE AS THE ENDING TO BLAIR WITCH 2
<prince-dari> That game is so glitchy
<Meanwhile> There was a Blair Witch 2?
<MadSurge> :D
<prince-dari> It's brilliant
<dr-whooves> Been conemplating suicide due to an infinite amount of bullshit, then i thougt, fuck taht ive got ponies, so i need some cheering up, whats streaming?
<Meanwhile> Mock the Week clip apparently.
<Panda|Sorting> First, Dark92Enigma, anything having to do with the "Blair Witch," makes no sense. Second, its probably a glitch in the system. Just make another email. It's what I would do anyway.
<Dark92Enigma> Panda|Sorting: yes, but i need to get into my mom's e-mail account, and that would mean to blow my cover as a brony
<lyrical> are
<lyrical> you all
<lyrical> undercover bronys?
<ArcherJoe11> Dark92Enigma: just create a new one.
<Panda|Sorting> lyrical nope.
<Dark92Enigma> Ok, i'll try to make another e-mail.....the key word being try
<Meanwhile> Depends, is that a misspelling of bronies?
<lyrical> panda
<lyrical> what is this?
<Panda|Sorting> Dark92Enigma you do not need higher privleges on a computer to create an email.
<Panda|Sorting> lyrical what is what.
<lyrical> go to
<lyrical> gmail
<lyrical> and create email
<lyrical> easy
<DaringDerpy> what is this and why are these people laughing?
<Jmo> Typing in one sentence is easy too.
<Panda|Sorting> lyrical, not using the enter key is easy too.
<lyrical> hey man its just an addiction
<lyrical> like smoking
<lyrical> you know
<lyrical> nothing can be done
<lyrical> i know its wrong
<Jmo> LOL
<lyrical> but its just how it is
<DaringDerpy> flood kick
<Meanwhile> Being a twonk is an addiction now?

<prince-dari> lyrical
<Panda|Sorting> lyrical, I'll leave the explainations to Meanwhile, but seems he is Spiderman.mp4.
<lyrical> i dont know about that my friend
<Meanwhile> Or gimboid. Or halftop. Or jerrycan. Or dingleberry.
<lyrical> he must be that stimpy from cartoon
<lyrical> a fucking stupid one
<MadSurge> Nice hooters. :D

<lyrical> i have enough alcohol
<lyrical> till like 11h at night
<lyrical> im good
<lyrical> thanks for reminder tho
<lyrical> dari
<Panda|Sorting> otakon used the enterkey often before using the enterkey was cool.
<lyrical> you know what? if you dont want to see me just kick me or ban me i wont get mad
<lyrical> honestly
<Meanwhile> It's easy to understand if you have greater mental comprehension than a cheese sandwich. Which is probablt why you're having difficulty.
<Meanwhile> probably*
<prince-dari> Ouch
<Jmo> dabi wouldn't mind that offer
<prince-dari> Dem Geordies
<Panda|Sorting> Couldn't have said it better.
<lyrical> you know whats the funny part is?
<lyrical> im in this channel

<Meanwhile> No non image links during a stream.
<Vivix> Some of us do
<lyrical> well its that good you dont need to understand it
<lyrical> Vivix
<lyrical> you do?
<Vivix> not me, but I think some russians hang here
<lyrical> nice
<Meanwhile> If you're going to hang around this room lyrical you should read the rules.
<lyrical> rules?
<lyrical> what kind of rules there can be?
<Panda|Sorting> lyrical, you arent special. Russian is a language. People know it.
<lyrical> i aint even russian man
<Meanwhile> http://www.bronystate.net/rules/
<lyrical> i live with them
<lyrical> what the fuck
<lyrical> is the stream?
<DaringDerpy> oh wow...now the primitives attacked the german embassy
<lyrical> is it some roleplay shit ?
<Meanwhile> Guess you wandered in here from the chat client as opposed to the website.
<lyrical> in IRC
<Meanwhile> This room is linked to a livestream video service.
<DaringDerpy> http://www.bronystate.net/theater/twilight-sparkle/
<lyrical> you mean
<lyrical> some one streaming the chat?
<Panda|Sorting> look, you are being an annoyance at the moment. I usually have a shy, calm demeanor, but you need to go, or stop.
<Meanwhile> I mean, someone is playing videos for the chat.
<lyrical> i dont getit
*Jmo slaps prince-dari around a bit with a large trout
<Meanwhile> Like I said, intellect of a slab of brie.
<lyrical> please
<lyrical> vonderkid
<lyrical> explain better
<Vivix> lyrical, we're watching a video stream, so we're not allowed to link non image links
<dr-whooves> Anyone else try to click the anotation?
<Vivix> this chat is directly linked to said videostream
<Meanwhile> I'm sorry but I'm just not thick enough to explain it simpler.
<lyrical> you mean this chat goes to some streamers video chat?
<Meanwhile> I guess I could try and headbutt a wall a few times and then try again.
<Vivix> opposite, this chat is on a video stream site
<Vivix> like irc imbed
<lyrical> where the shit it streams
<prince-dari> You know, there is a channel topic
<lyrical> give me website
<ArcherJoe11> http://www.bronystate.net/theater
<DaringDerpy> http://www.bronystate.net/theater/twilight-sparkle/ click the link, lyrical
<Kammerjunk> prince-dari: But alas, the topic is read about as often as the rules.

<Vivix> Jimmy Carr is hilarious
<Meanwhile> This guy on stream.
<Panda|Sorting> Hold on, let me turn the stream on.

<Jmo> w.u.t
<Panda|Sorting> Oh! This guy.
<prince-dari> Jimmy Carr is loving this
<prince-dari> This is why you don't heckle comedians

<Gold_Demona> I think I'm just gonna leave for the day, since my IRC won't stop derping. It'll free up more bandwidth for my torrent.

<Wirisme> Hi AJIsAwesome!
<DaringDerpy> hi AJIsAwesome :)
*AJIsAwesome hugs Wirisme and DaringDerpy. :)
<DaringDerpy> :)
<alexxm> how are things AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> alexxm: Pretty good. Just finished some tests.
<ArcherJoe11> hey AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> Hello, ArcherJoe11! :)
<twilight_sprinklenap> Mfw my programming teacher took off 5% of my score for an assignment because i added a few extra spaces before a few lines of code and its not aligned with the other lines, even though i did it to distinguish it from the rest
<Meanwhile> God damn this is funny.
<Vivix> coomplaain
<Wirisme> dat comment section
<prince-dari> Dat Iranian culture
<RainbowAsh> twilight_sprinklenap, learn from it. Misaligned code can be a real pain in the flank.
<twilight_sprinklenap> RainbowAsh i did it on purpose though, it was a small program so it helped distinguish that part from the rest
<twilight_sprinklenap> RainbowAsh and its not worth 5 percent
<Meanwhile> Pistachio nuts.
<Kandarihu> EXACTLY
<Kandarihu> Iran's claiming that they aren't making nuclear bombs, but they just want it for energy and nothing else.
<Kandarihu> Er, the Iranian government.
<RainbowAsh> twilight_sprinklenap, yeah, probably not. But there are better ways to distinguish parts of code, like comments or putting it in seperate functions or methods.
<Meanwhile> Go away Kandarihu, you're too much of a stick in the mud for comedy streams.
<Kandarihu> Meanwhile, could you please not censor me?
<Meanwhile> Only when you stop being someone's grumpy dad.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya guys
<RainbowAsh> Kandarihu, yeah, but how believable are those claims?
<Kandarihu> RainbowAsh, some people are falling for them... I think.
<twilight_sprinklenap> RainbowAsh i know but the program and lines were so small, that adding comments would just be unncssary
<Vivix> would he have decked you five percent if you had tabbed them?
<prince-dari> Woo
<prince-dari> Dance tiem
<AJIsAwesome> ohai MLP_Brovakiin ")
<AJIsAwesome> *:)
<alexxm> nice dancing
<Dragonmatte> Aww... I just bought deux ex, the original.
<Vivix> One thing about tests in art and writing that took me a while to get, is that we're testing if we've understood the rules, not whether or not we can bend them. Once you understand the rules you can break them to do what you need to do. Don't know if the same principle stands in that programming test
<Dragonmatte> But i can't play it, cuz it says: Failed to find steam
<Vivix> O.o-
<Dragonmatte> Need help q_q
<RainbowAsh> Vivix, well put.
<twilight_sprinklenap> Vivix: he only sent out the criteria after the assignemnt tho. plus i dont thats in there
<Kandarihu> All I really know about the Iranian people are that they're a nice people who have no ill will towards anyone.
<KnifeH> My brain just twitched from the last message.
<Vivix> Ah- okay
<KnifeH> But fair enough, hi all
<Vivix> Hiya
<alexxm> i like this guys godzilla impression
<Kandarihu> Godzilla bellydancing to indian music, wow
<alexxm> how are things KnifeH
<Vivix> but yeah RainbowAsh, if I had gotten that during the time I had art tests and such, I probably woulda gotten better grades <,<.. /regrets
<prince-dari> Next Heroes ep?
<KnifeH> alexxm: Busy. Wanna get home and draw
<Kandarihu> Sounds fine
<twilight_sprinklenap> omg i missed a heroes ep?
<prince-dari> Yeah, you missed ep 13
<twilight_sprinklenap> crap
<Kandarihu> Alright. Black Mesa Source is downloading now.
<twilight_sprinklenap> yay for recaps
<AJIsAwesome> What's the synopsis of Black Mesa Source?
<MadSurge> Bye guys, gotta start getting ready for meeting my ex schoolmates :D
<Kandarihu> I also figured out how the friend invite system works.
<prince-dari> Cya MadSurge, have fun
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Bye! :)
<Kandarihu> ...on PSO2
<twilight_sprinklenap> bye MasSurge

<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: indeed
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: another country
<Kandarihu> RainbowAsh, it's kind of a re-imaging by fans of Half-Life in the Source Engine.
<KnifeH> And suddenly elbows. Elbows everywhere :/
<RainbowAsh> Saturn, nice, I'll have to have a look at that.
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: Does he have Skpye?
<Vivix> they started working on it in 2004
<Jmo> dat KnifeH
<Alchemist> Saturn: well that sucks. At least you can get virtual hugs here :D
<Vivix> it's--soo fun to finally have it
<shana> Vivix: wait I thought that was half life source oO
<Vivix> tghat was a fast port, this is a total remake by fans
<Vivix> from 2004-2012, and part - XEN and the rest is still not finished

<Kammerjunk> AJTheMightyGamer: Yes and no.
<AJTheMightyGamer> ah
<Kammerjunk> AJTheMightyGamer: That was a parody.
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: So this isn't canon?
<AJTheMightyGamer> i see

<Meanwhile> Pfft, no that's exactly what happened.
<Kammerjunk> I see a little silhouette of Tennant.
<AJTheMightyGamer> oh boy, it feels like years since i have been on the site.
<Sylandest> Tennant! <3
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: Do you have a Desktop OC, prince-dari?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back AJTheMightyGamer
<MLP_Brovakiin> :P
<Kammerjunk> I think only Sumica, Wrek and Phase4 have desktop OCs.
<AJTheMightyGamer> hooray!
<AJIsAwesome> Well, welcome back, AJTheMightyGamer! :)
<Meanwhile> Nittany has one too.
<Kandarihu> Well, Black Mesa Source is installing now
*AJTheMightyGamer spins on the floor
<Kammerjunk> Oh?
<AJIsAwesome> I thought Scoots had one too.
<VenHur> Hello everyone.
<Meanwhile> As does Scoots.
<AJIsAwesome> Ohai VenHur! :)
<AJTheMightyGamer> hi VenHur
<Kammerjunk> I thought they only had regular OCs.
<AJIsAwesome> And what about SlurryMoon?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Heya VenHur
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Tennant.
<Meanwhile> Don't think Slurry has one.
<LadyCanary> Hi Mr.Tennant <3
*LadyCanary swoons
<Shizuka> 13.////.
<Kammerjunk> I was going to get a cup of tea, but I think that can wait.
<AJIsAwesome> Wasn't there one OC where he makes a tornado?
<Sylandest> LadyCanary: might I swoon alongside you?
<Bronysith> hi there Shizuka
<DaringDerpy> oh, dr who
<Agrold> yay this episode:)
<Kammerjunk> Suddenly, Shizuka.
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome Nittany's yes
<LadyCanary> Shizu, can we share? .////.
<Shizuka> 13ancient romans don't notice a man in a suit
<AJIsAwesome> killerpony7733: OH........:$
<prince-dari> I think he explains that
<prince-dari> Can't remember
<DaringDerpy> big city, lots of crazy people
<Sylandest> prince-dari: oh you
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome Ya like his OC?
<Kammerjunk> Si fueris alibi, vivito sicut ibi.
<AJIsAwesome> killerpony7733: Yeah, I like it. I just haven't seen it in a while.
<killerpony7733> AJIsAwesome Nittany hasn't been too much around for a while
<Kandarihu> My installation of Black Mesa Source is going slowly.
<prince-dari> So apparently Rome is like Soho
<Kandarihu> And I think I know why.
<Kencolt> Well, that's enough for the clothes.
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu I can't even get a hold of a decent non turrent DL
<AJIsAwesome> killerpony7733: I know. I hope he's alright.
<Shizuka> 13little red riding hood noooo
<prince-dari> XD
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu torrent*
<Kandarihu> killerpony7733, oh, I think the torrent is part of the problem, but not from being defunct.
<AJTheMightyGamer> OH NOES!
<Meanwhile> Hahaha, property damage.
<LadyCanary> ...Oh shiiiit
<AJIsAwesome> And he rhymed. :D
<Shizuka> 13all the children look forward to volcano day
<Flyboy> volcano day, brings back memories of Captian jack :(
<MLP_Brovakiin> dat reference
<killerpony7733> Kandarihu Well for me the EU download is down then one or two of the global ones are sucky and really can't DL for me
<AJTheMightyGamer> this is the first time for me seeing dr who
<Kandarihu> I put it on my external HDD, and I'm seeding it from there, AND I'm trying to install it from the 7z atthe same time.
<Shizuka> 13the torrent has abysmal seeders
<Shizuka> 13but i'm 33% through so no sense starting the direct now
<AJIsAwesome> AJTheMightyGamer: You're alright. People say this is the best doctor.
<DaringDerpy> oh the noes
<Kandarihu> The real screwiness is that my upload is going at about 6MB/s which is about twice the upstream I'm supposed to have.
<AJIsAwesome> I'm new to Doctor Who, too.
<AJTheMightyGamer> AJIsAwesome: well, he seems pretty cool
<Meanwhile> Was anyone going to stream the Black Mesa thing?
<DaringDerpy> new riches
<Sumica> 00,10by the time you hit 50 Shizuka the direct would be done
<Alchemist> I just realised that I need steam to play black mesa source and I dont have steam :D
<Kandarihu> So I'm probably overloading my USB Cable like this
<HavokOC> Hey Guys
<Shizuka> 13not at my direct speeds
<Shizuka> 13i never get 1M/s with http
<Bronysith> Shizuka: where do i put the file for the Black Mesa port?
<Meanwhile> No? Good.
<Sumica> 00,10Sounds like a limiter problem
<LadyCanary> Sumi!
<Sumica> 00,10LadyCanary~
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/6nBST.png so apparently this is happening
<Alchemist> star trek?
*LadyCanary tilts head.
<prince-dari> Shizuka: I dun geddit
<Meanwhile> Shizu: Not sure if fashion or new Star Trek movie.
<AJTheMightyGamer> both
<LadyCanary> Face of...stone? Oh sh-.
<alexxm> is the daughter the woman who plays amy pond?
<prince-dari> No
<AJIsAwesome> Makes sense to me. :P
<Rainbow> hey
<AJIsAwesome> I'm guessing it's Star Trek fashion?
<prince-dari> TARDIS Time Lord, yeah
<AJTheMightyGamer> so... can someone tell me what this show is about?
<Meanwhile> Spaceman
<Rainbow> whats is the movie/show
<alexxm> doctor who
<AJIsAwesome> AJTheMightyGamer: Time traveler who saves the universe.
<prince-dari> It's set in ancient Roman times
<Kandarihu> Rainbow, this is Doctor Who
<prince-dari> With a man who's ahead of his time
<prince-dari> And wears a suit
<AJIsAwesome> ohai Rainbow. :)
<Rainbow> oh i've never seen doctor qho
<Rainbow> *who
<Barbetos|AtWork> Return the slab!
<AJTheMightyGamer> AJIsAwesome: seems normal to me. :)
<prince-dari> Oh, an there's some random person made of stone
<Rainbow> ohai AJisawesome
<prince-dari> and*
<Rainbow> not bad
<Shizuka> 13oh there's why
<AJIsAwesome> Remids me of the drapes in The Room. :D
<Shizuka> 13blocks are 4MB on the black mesa torrent
<AJIsAwesome> *Reminds*
<Rainbow> :D doctor who has epic british voice
<Shizuka> 13which means the bad seeds will take longer to give you their piece and move on
<Barbetos|AtWork> Yeah. Started the torrent this morning when it released. Its only 50 percent done. Direct download will be done a lot faster.
<Rainbow> brb letting mah dog out >.>
<DaringDerpy> true, Rainbow
<LadyCanary> XDD
<AJIsAwesome> Wait, does it cost money to download then?
<AJIsAwesome> Via direct?
<Kandarihu> Alright. Firing up Black Mesa
<Sumica> 00,10was wondering if it was a badly writen torrent, seeing as the tracker was 16megs
<Shizuka> 13they should have made the piece size much smaller, you're committed to 4MB at a time from a seed the way it is now, and these seeds are stupidly slow
<DaringDerpy> marvel inspector
<Rainbow> back
<Rainbow> :p
<Rainbow> brb
<DaringDerpy> wb

<prince-dari> Psychics, psychics everywhere
<MLP_Brovakiin> a shitlord
<Rainbow> not even watching the show just hearing it
<AJTheMightyGamer> oh man, october is best month, the texas weather gets cooler, my birthday, nightmare night/ halloween, and ponies!

<Shizuka> 13other than the shacknews download, all the other mirrors are broken
<AJIsAwesome> ohai IshSexiestPony :)
<AJTheMightyGamer> hi IshSexiestPony
<XAXpod> Okay, so the Transit system ride on Black Mesa Source. It's BEAUTIFUL.
<IshSexiestPony> Stupid Sexy Dari
<prince-dari> Ohai
<Shizuka> 13don't spoil it
<alexxm> how are things IshSexiestPony
<Shizuka> 13i want to stream it later
<Wirisme> They should announce the date for the announcement for the S3 date
<Rainbow> ad
<Rainbow> back
<Meanwhile> Oh so there will be Black Mesa stream?
<RanbowDash90> o3o
<Shizuka> 13comcast willing
<AJIsAwesome> Even if they did, we'd still have to wait.
<RanbowDash90> i is here tooz
<Kammerjunk> Ipso facto, arcanum arcanorum.
<Meanwhile> Damn, I was hoping to not have to ignore stream for however long.
<RanbowDash90> ^^
<Sumica> 00,10inb4 every one streames it
<grayhoof> Hi Guys!
<Barbetos|AtWork> Shizuka: I got the fileshack one to work.
<AJIsAwesome> DAT JUMPCUT
<AJIsAwesome> ohai grayhoof :)
<Shizuka> 13someone will beat me to it anyway i'm sure
<Meanwhile> Sumica: Mm, probably. Going to be a very dull day.
<IshSexiestPony> Stupid Sexy Docter
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Shizuka> 13i spoke too soon, the fileshack one crashed
<AJIsAwesome> That sucks.
<Rainbow> back
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: It's all slow, as far as I can tell.
<Reikim|Preread> Shizuka: Toreeeeent
<AJIsAwesome> wb Rainbow
<Shizuka> 13i am using torrent
<Reikim|Preread> Also hi everyone
<XAXpod> Shizuka: Just get it from shacknews :$
<Shizuka> 13the seeds are horrible
<RanbowDash90> what we eatching anyhow guyz???
<XAXpod> ^
<Barbetos|AtWork> Eyep
<AJIsAwesome> ohai Reikim|Preread :)
<Shizuka> 13i just told you the shacknews crashed
<XAXpod> Oh...
<Reikim|Preread> Funny, you'd think everyone and their mother would be torrenting it.
<Sumica> 00,10if this direct works shizu we can try skype, it's probably faster =p
<Rainbow> its showing doctor who
<XAXpod> Fileshack = shacknews. derp.
<Shizuka> 13skype barely breaks 100k/s
<Meanwhile> Reikim|Preread: Which is why they're all goofed.
<Rainbow> :|
<Reikim|Preread> Meanwhile: The torrent, not the DDL.
<Sumica> 00,10the torrent is pooorly witen and full of seeders that dont know how to torrent properly
<AJIsAwesome> It dun goofed.
<Sumica> 00,10exactly Shizuka =p
<Reikim|Preread> There's a proper way to torrent?
<AJTheMightyGamer> ha, i just time traveld to the futrue, and i know all about season 3! morgan freeman saves the man 6 from bowser, fluttershy turns into a dish washer for some reason, and rainbow dash becomes an orange
<Meanwhile> Reikim|Preread: Yeah that really doesn't mean anything to me.
<Rainbow> they have eyes on their hands?
<Shizuka> 13found a tarball link someone on spuf is hosting, going to see if laptop can wget faster than torrent
<Kandarihu> Sumica, I'm seeding like crazy here.
<Sumica> 00,10well there are better ways to torrent yes
<Rainbow> thats wrong
<Reikim|Preread> Meanwhile: There's torrenting and then there's Direct Download. They're different thingies, and work differently. That's about all you need to know.
<Shizuka> 13i'm doing 340k/s down, 220 up
<Barbetos|AtWork> AJTheMightyGamer: I knew that season 3 would ruin everything. The Man 6. =\
<Bronysith> holy fuck 1 day to download this
<Kammerjunk> I am so, so sorry.
<Meanwhile> Reikim|Preread: Fair enough.
<AJTheMightyGamer> lol brb
<Rainbow> *mane
<Reikim|Preread> So what's a *good* way to torrent?
<Rainbow> =/
<killerpony7733> Shizuka If this link and all is gonna keep up from shacknews i say 4 hours max till it finishes
<Barbetos|AtWork> Even the falsehoods are important.
<Reikim|Preread> I usually just pop open torrents in my client and forget about it...
<Sumica> 00,101.2 down on the direct from that one you said was down Shizuka
<Rainbow> <_<
<Sumica> 00,10Bronysith, it should go faster as more seeded are finished
<Bronysith> Sumica: righto, but still along time lols
<IshSexiestPony> Is he in the past or future?
<Reikim|Preread> Bronysith: I spent a week downloading Mass Effect. Your argument is invalid.
<Kammerjunk> Hm. GameConnect was pretty fast for me.
<pony_7616> BROHOOF anyone?
<Rainbow> i'm auctally kinda engoying doctor who
<Shizuka> 13wasn't down, just died
<Rainbow> *enjoying
<AJIsAwesome> pony_7616: /)
<Meanwhile> Anyone really not care about Black Mesa at all?
<Rainbow> pony_7616 /)
<AJIsAwesome> pony_7616: You new here?
<Rainbow> ima girl though
<Wirisme> pony_7616 /)
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Me. :$
<pony_7616> yeah
<IshSexiestPony> We should watch Hercules the Legendary Journeys
<alexxm> i have no idea what this black messa thing is all i know is that it's the science place in half life
<AJIsAwesome> pony_7616: Well, welcome to Bronystate! Make sure to read the rules. :)
<Meanwhile> Great, that's a total of 3 including myself.
<Rainbow> i needa see the rules where are they?
<prince-dari> Meanwhile: Me too
<Meanwhile> 4.
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: It's not my style, but people can like it if they want to.
<Shizuka> 13great now we get to listen to people bitching about the general excitement for a mod that's been in development for eight years
<pony_7616> i already did
<Meanwhile> Yeah you do
<Meanwhile> Deal with it.
<LadyCanary> Im meeeelting me-or not
<Rainbow> rb
<AJIsAwesome> I'm not bitching, it's just not my style of game. :S
<prince-dari> Well, he asked, so I answered
<Bronysith> AJIsAwesome: what? you dont like good games?
<prince-dari> I haven't been on anyone's back about it
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: It's just not something I would really play, TBH.
<Reikim|Preread> I'm going to try it out just for fun.
<AJIsAwesome> Take Borderlands, for example. It seems like a great game, but it's not something that I would play.
<AJIsAwesome> *Borderlands 2*
<Reikim|Preread> Never played Half Life. I'm psyched to have a chance to play it for free.
*Reikim|Preread is a cheap bastard
<AJIsAwesome> Same thing with Mass Effect and Half Life.
<Bronysith> Reikim|Preread: hehe, i only paid 10 bucks for every single half life
<Bronysith> thank you steam sales
<Shizuka> 13pulling 1M/s from this tarball even while torrent is still going
<Bronysith> 22.3 KB/s for me right now
<Meanwhile> I'm hardly going to begrudge people for wanting to play it, I'm just wholly uninterested.
<Reikim|Preread> Is that...is that a whole megabyte per second?
*Reikim|Preread dies of envy
<Shizuka> 13it comes and goes rei, it's averaging closer to 600k/s
<Reikim|Preread> See Shizu, thing is, a rate like that is a bit of a punch in the gut for me.
<Shizuka> 13it's pulling directly from some guy's seedbox they linked on the steam forums
<Bronysith> i have no rush to play this game
<Reikim|Preread> You know, seeing as I usually average...maybe twenty kb/s? On a good day.
<Bronysith> so i dont care how long it takes lol
<prince-dari> >20 kb/s
<Kammerjunk> Gesundheit.
<PillowPoni> What did it say?
<Reikim|Preread> Most days I'm pulling single-digit download speeds.
<AJIsAwesome> WHat?
<Shizuka> 13DSL?
<DaringDerpy> danke
<AJIsAwesome> What did it say?
<prince-dari> That's almost the level of otakon's carrier pigeon system
<Reikim|Preread> Single-digit kilobytes, mind you.
<Meanwhile> Hehehe.
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: Oh, that's terrible. :D
<Bronysith> HA
<Kammerjunk> DaringDerpy: Bitte.
<Bronysith> prince-dari: ha
<Shizuka> 13dialup?
<alexxm> watch out he has a water pistol
<Reikim|Preread> You know, I'm kind of annoyed he's not here for that.
<DaringDerpy> :)
<IshSexiestPony> Stupid Sexy Everypony
<Shizuka> 13carrier pigeons make up for in transfer time what they do in amount
<Bronysith> only fucking 19.2 Kb/s :D
<Rainbow> ok i read the rules
<Reikim|Preread> No, it's not dialup, but it tends to go reeeaaaally slowly. I have no idea why.
<Shizuka> 13strap an SD card to a pigeon and he'll average gigabytes per second
<prince-dari> XD
<Reikim|Preread> Don't they have hundred-gigabyte USB drives by now?
*AJIsAwesome still likes carrier pigeons. :$
<DaringDerpy> filesharing is very underdeveloped
<Shizuka> 13shipping a terabyte hard drive somewhere is faster than transferring over network
<Reikim|Preread> I know 32G is common.
<DaringDerpy> no commercial networks
<Shizuka> 13micro-SD is in the 64GB range i think
<AJIsAwesome> I would LOVE to have a terabyte hardrive. :O
<Meanwhile> Vulcan neck cult
<Stallion_of_War> I bet she's had a lot of rocky relationships
<AJIsAwesome> *hard drive*
<Shizuka> 13those things are as big as my thumb nail
<AJIsAwesome> Stallion_of_War: Booooo..........
<Reikim|Preread> Meanwhile: A cult of Vulcans that worship the beauty of necks?
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: I have 3 TB across two hard drives. I'm going to need more soon.
<Meanwhile> Reikim|Preread: Something like that.
<prince-dari> Kammerjunk: Same here
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: Wow........:O
<prince-dari> I've got a 2 and a 1
<Reikim|Preread> How do you even
<Kammerjunk> Ditto.
<Stallion_of_War> this was the first episode of Doctor Who I saw, incidentally prince-dari introducted me to it.
<Stallion_of_War> THANKS DARI!
<Shizuka> 13i'm sitting on 2.5TB if you don't count my other externals and boxen
<prince-dari> <:
<Reikim|Preread> I've got a mere 500GB here on this laptop and I'm far from filling it.
<Shizuka> 13if you do, probably 2.8
<Kammerjunk> Oh yeah, there's the fileserver with a few TB, but I don't count it.
<Kammerjunk> I barely use it, anyway.
<AJIsAwesome> I need to find a terabyte hard drive. :D
<Stallion_of_War> Pompeii is fixed! It can't have children.
<Bronysith> i have 2 TB of memory
<Shizuka> 13my server is only 80GB
<Reikim|Preread> How do you need a terabyte?
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: They're not that expensive, I reckon.
<Shizuka> 13steam
<Rainbow> XD
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: Really? :S
<Reikim|Preread> O.o
<Shizuka> 13seriously the vast majority of my drive space is steam
<Kammerjunk> Reikim|Preread: On my fileserver, I have 1 TB video alone.
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: For that much memory?
<Reikim|Preread> You must have a LOT of Steam games, SHizu.
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: Yeah, Steam takes a lot.
<Shizuka> 13i do
<prince-dari> £60 for a 2TB drive maybe?
<Shizuka> 13i play a small fraction of them, but i leave almost all of them installed
<AJIsAwesome> Wow.......
<Shizuka> 13because install time is pffft
<AJIsAwesome> That's cheap. :O
<Eli> the balrog left middle earth i see
<Shizuka> 13yeah 2TB is crashing in price
<ekips> they dug too far
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Stallion_of_War> I think the monster may be a little hot under the collar. Seems angry.
<ekips> now the balrog is not amused
<Kammerjunk> I'm already excited about getting a petabyte hard drive when I can.
<Kammerjunk> ekips: It's because it wasn't allowed to pass.
<Stallion_of_War> lol petabyte
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: Wait, petabyte?
<Reikim|Preread> ...Petabyte.
<Reikim|Preread> That's a thing now?
<Meanwhile> Rocky 4.
<Kammerjunk> AJIsAwesome: 1024 TB.
<Eli> Gandalf should have used a water pistol too... he would have won instantly
<Rainbow> hardrive talk
<AJIsAwesome> Kammerjunk: OH MY GOSH...........:O
<Kammerjunk> Reikim|Preread: Well, not realistically, but yeah.
<Shizuka> 13google runs in the petabytes
<Rainbow> i gtg
<Shizuka> 13if not exabytes, the next tier up
<AJIsAwesome> bye Rainbow :)
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: Yup. What was it? 20 PB per day?
<Kammerjunk> Handled data, that is.
<DaringDerpy> bye rainbow
<Stallion_of_War> Rock solid plan Doctor
<Shizuka> 13basically a stupidly high number
<prince-dari> Dat pun
<AJIsAwesome> I didn't even know there were exabytes. :D
<IshSexiestPony> Not being too familiar with the series, I must ask, does the show have a reason for why he doesn't go back in time to stop certain deaths and disasters?
<AJIsAwesome> IshSexiestPony: Paradoxes.
<Meanwhile> No. Bad pun.
<prince-dari> Because they're fixed points in time
<Shizuka> 13yottabyte is the highest recognized tier i think
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: How much memory?
<Reikim|Preread> IshSexiestPony: The timeline does not like paradoxes.
<prince-dari> If he changed them the whole of history and the future would be destroyed pretty much
<Shizuka> 13or might be zetabyte, not sure which one's higher since we don't usually operate up there yet
<Stallion_of_War> You can't go back in time and interfear with your own personal history either.
<Stallion_of_War> Or else you might end up being your own grandfather
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: Probably will eventually.
<Shizuka> 13each tier is 1024x the next lower
<Wirisme> why 1024?
<IshSexiestPony> Stallion_of_War thats Futurama silly
<Kammerjunk> Wirisme: Because binary.
<AJIsAwesome> I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE THINGS EXISTS. :O
<Wirisme> Oh yeah
<AJIsAwesome> *EXIST*
<Shizuka> 13bytes are 8 bits, 1024 is 1 followed by 10 zeroes in binary
<Stallion_of_War> YOL TOR SHOL!
<Shizuka> 13so it's sort of like base ten, only expressible in round binary
<Kammerjunk> Well, it's Pompei or paradox.
<Reikim|Preread> Oh, someone asked why 1024?
<prince-dari> They gon' kill everyone in Pompeii
<Reikim|Preread> Because powers of two, of course.
<Kammerjunk> By the power of two!
<Kammerjunk> I have the power!
*Bronysith gangnam styles on Sumica
<Shizuka> 131024 is the nearest power of two to a power of ten
<Stallion_of_War> 20k v all of humanity...
<Meanwhile> If he were a vulcan he'd have no problem whatsoever.
<IshSexiestPony> So I can't use a tardis to go back in time and make my life better? :(
<Meanwhile> The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: and the british
<AJIsAwesome> IshSexiestPony: Nope. Paradoxes.
<Stallion_of_War> http://nooooooooooooooo.com/
<shana> Shizuka: what about 0?
<Reikim|Preread> Guess which race most often gets labeled as cold-hearted bastards?
<Kammerjunk> IshSexiestPony: One of two things would probably happen: 1) TIME PARADOX. 2) Alternate reality.
<Shizuka> 130 is zero
<bicyclerepairman> but 1MB == 1000kB
<Meanwhile> Reikim|Preread: The English?
<Shizuka> 13zero doesn't count
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim|Preread: Which one?
<AJTheMightyGamer> chat derped on me, well i am back from lunch
<DaringDerpy> losing the whole planet would cause a few problems in the plotline
<prince-dari> bicyclerepairman: Wut, no
<Shizuka> 13just like 1
<Sumica> 00,10if you tryed that then langolears show up and eat every one on earth who is not in a realy old building
<Reikim|Preread> Meanwhile: Yes, but not the answer I'm looking for.
<prince-dari> 1MB = 1024 KB
<shana> and why do they not count :(
<Shizuka> 13zero isn't a power of anything
<LadyCanary> LOL Tennants face.
<bicyclerepairman> you're thinking about about MiB
<Shizuka> 13or rather
<Shizuka> 13zero is a power of everything, it doesn't count
<Reikim|Preread> Whut not
<Reikim|Preread> *no
<Shizuka> 13you can't reach zero by exponents, anything to the power zero is 1
<bicyclerepairman> 1MiB == 1024kiB
<Stallion_of_War> LUNA NO!
<Reikim|Preread> Yay Shizu
<IshSexiestPony> I heard Vesuvius might be on teh verge of blowin again
<Shizuka> 13mebibytes can go die
<Kammerjunk> ^
<Eli> they would have never made it... the whole point of pompej was that it was one of the fastest vulcano erruptions ever
<prince-dari> bicyclerepairman: Da fuck are you talking about?
<Shizuka> 13we were here first, megabytes is 1024 kilobytes is 1024 bytes
<IshSexiestPony> now kiss
<AJIsAwesome> IshSexiestPony: No. :D
<Shizuka> 13kibibytes and tebibytes can die too
<shana> lim b^x x->-infinity --> 0
<IshSexiestPony> AJIsAwesome Yes
<Meanwhile> Now I am become Gigabyte, destroyer of systems.
<Stallion_of_War> Fun Fact: Soothsayers sometimes reincarnate as Amy Pond
<bicyclerepairman> prince-dari: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_bits#Multiple_bits
<Kammerjunk> Meanwhile: Do ho ho.
<IshSexiestPony> Roo, ringer in ry rutt
<bicyclerepairman> because kilo, Mega and all the rest are SI prefixes defined by powers of ten
<prince-dari> Well screw that
<Kammerjunk> You've got to go back, Doctor! Back - to the future!
<prince-dari> 1MB = 1024KB, I don't care about the other system
<Stallion_of_War> Just this once Rose, EVERONE DIES!
<bicyclerepairman> there's no other system :D
<Shizuka> 13except the other system is metric
<Stallion_of_War> Kaunt
<AJIsAwesome> I can see why people love this doctor.
<Stallion_of_War> He just kaunt
<Shizuka> 13SI wants to define a megabyte to mean 1000 kilobytes
<Meanwhile> He did nauht.
<prince-dari> Now what he needs to say here
<prince-dari> Is definitely
<prince-dari> "Come with me if you want to live"
<Meanwhile> This is killing my heartstring.
<Shizuka> 13and if a kilobyte is defined as 1000 bytes, then the new megabyte is significantly smaller than the true megabyte in powers of 1024
*Stallion_of_War dat vworp
<AJIsAwesome> Wait a minute, doesn't this cause a paradox?
<AJTheMightyGamer> ADVENTURE
<Kammerjunk> prince-dari: I would pay a lot of money to hear Tennant say that in a Schwarzenegger imitation.
<Barbetos|AtWork> "Get to the chop... Tardis!"
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Close enough.jpg prince-dari
<AJIsAwesome> Oh wait NVm.
<Brad[Laptop]> http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=591_1347578176
<prince-dari> Why would is AJIsAwesome?
<Shizuka> 13nonetheless, hard drive manufacturers build to powers of ten, which is why a 1TB hard drive only holds 900GB
<bicyclerepairman> well, the true Megabyte is 1,000,000 byte
<Meanwhile> 4 people in 20,000. Who'd notice?
<AJIsAwesome> prince-dari: Never mind, this scene explains it.
<Reikim|Preread> Shizuka: Wouldn't that completely screw over the entire thing? I mean, powers of two are just /natural/ for data, what with everything being in binary. A 1000-kb megabyte would just cause unnecessary problems.
<bicyclerepairman> and the one in powers of 2 is just the binary approximation to the true megabyte
<Shizuka> 13and now you understand the mebibyte/megabyte holy war
<Stallion_of_War> That roman guy looks oddly hispanic
<Shizuka> 13just like vi/emacs and pc/mac before it
<Stallion_of_War> ECHO

<Reikim|Preread> Shizuka: There's absolutely no possibility of loaning me a bit of your connection, is there? Via magic?
<Kammerjunk> Shizuka: Really? ._. I'm on 1.7MB/s.
<Stallion_of_War> Vulcan's all "Get the buck off my island, dumb mortals"

<prince-dari> It's great to be you, I suppose
