<thehated5689> heyo butterfly_pony
<ScootaChicken> Morrowind...
<Nyria> That NPC...
<Ninjapony> Eeek, don't use me as a nom-shield :O
*SaLKiD99 gives Ninjapony Skittles
<ScootaChicken> what a beastly game
<Kammerjunk> That is, when you have a headache.
<Ninjapony> Now this I can nom!
<Butterfly_Pony> : D
*Ninjapony omnomnomnoms
<Nyria> The soundtrack sounds like Back to the future's old west theme~
<thehated5689> i feel for ya kammerjunk, headaches are the worst :P
*SaLKiD99 just got 20% happier
<ScootaChicken> never would have seen that one coming Kammerjunk
<Kammerjunk> Well, off the top of my head, I could name a few things worse. Don't know why I'd have them on the top of my head, though.
<Kammerjunk> That's just silly.
<ScootaChicken> dohoho
*thehated5689 has been sat down
<Kammerjunk> So I made myself a cup of Earl Gray instead.
<SaLKiD99> Lag?
<Ninjapony> Use fus ro dah for maximum sprint
<thehated5689> no lag here
<Butterfly_Pony> jumping around?
<Darf14> Looks like walking than lag
<Kammerjunk> Jump around.
<Kammerjunk> Jump up, jump up and get down.
<Darf14> oh, hes carrying too much junk
<SaLKiD99> no , the part where he was getting his Necklace
<Kammerjunk> Do ho ho. Wrek is carrying too much junk.
<Kammerjunk> That sounds a lot like me, actually.
<Nyria> Your overencumbered and cannot run~
<Darf14> well, he can sell the extra stuff for money
<Ninjapony> Daedric is better than dragon armour
<Butterfly_Pony> jumping :D
<PartyCannon> skipping through the village~~~~
<SaLKiD99> lol
<Kammerjunk> That's literally the only thing I forget to do when I'm in down.
<Kammerjunk> Sell stuff.
<thehated5689> dragon armor is legendary
<thehated5689> most of it anyway
<Kammerjunk> in town*
<SaLKiD99> does Wrek have Wuuthrad? does anypony here have a Wuuthrad? (not showing off)
<Kammerjunk> Ugh. How do you ponies cope with laptop keyboards?
<Kammerjunk> They're so frustrating, I could just scream!
*thehated5689 is a level 15 and should play more often
<String_Shredder> BUMTAZER is best weapon
<Ninjapony> I don't, I have an extra USB keyboard
<Kammerjunk> String_Shredder: Mod it!
<PartyCannon> Kammerjunk: when I dock my laptop, I use a full size keyboard. :)
<Nyria> I wish I could have a type writter themed keyboard~
<String_Shredder> ^
<Kammerjunk> I will die a happy stallion if I'm never stuck with a laptop keyboard for two weeks again.
<ScootaChicken> no you don't Nyria, because typewriters don't have tildes
<Ninjapony> Yes, quite
*Ninjapony puts on monocle
<Nyria> ScootaChicken: I can fix that ^^
<SaLKiD99> i don't know why my younger brother is messing with my Privacy >:(
<Kammerjunk> Screw you, table ornaments.
<thehated5689> i sweat i thought that "struck with a laptop keyboard"
<SaLKiD99> (meant the angry face)
<pony_2539> c
<EatPinkPies> My friends could be real jerks sometimes
<String_Shredder> c
<SaLKiD99> c what?
<Nyria> You have thrown a labtop keyboard... It's super affective~!
<Ninjapony> c++
<Kammerjunk> SaLKiD99: I don't know why the film and music industries will be allowed to infiltrate our privacy.
<SaLKiD99> what's that?
<Ninjapony> Programming software
<thehated5689> hi eatpinkpies :D
<ScootaChicken> isn't it impossible to throw a laptop keyboard by itself?
<String_Shredder> a++ they all say. they love me on ebay
<Nyria> dat Suacy Armor~
<Nyria> saucy*
<EatPinkPies> hello
<Ninjapony> Tell me why
<SaLKiD99> well , i don't know that kind of stuff
<EatPinkPies> Be right back
<thehated5689> kk
<Darf14> Its possible if you throw the laptop
<Kammerjunk> Am I silly if I never knew you could rename stuff?
<SaLKiD99> didn't see you there , EatPinkiePies
<MirrorImage> ScootaChicken - a laptop keyboard can be removed if you know where the latches are
<Kammerjunk> I haven't played Skyrim much, anyway.
<SaLKiD99> me too
<thehated5689> aye
<arrowtobroknee> dat name
*Nyria doesn't have Skyrim~
<MirrorImage> though if you're referring to "throwing the keyboard in rage," then yeah, you typically just throw the whole laptop
<Ninjapony> I've played skyrim waaay too much
<otakon> Why is it you can only enchant the helms with crap?
<String_Shredder> Wrek's saucy armour is legendary
<otakon> none of the enchants are useful
<otakon> except for a mage
<thehated5689> gray
<otakon> eeyup
*Nyria enchants otakon's beard~
<MirrorImage> i beg to differ otakon
<SaLKiD99> 99 Chatters but a Hater aint's one :)
<otakon> MirrorImage: like what?
<Ninjapony> Reinforce Alchemy and smithing is useful
<MirrorImage> Alchemy
<otakon> don't do it
<Kammerjunk> SaLKiD99: Do ho ho.
<MirrorImage> or my shield of +50% blocking
<String_Shredder> shoot him in the knee with an arrow!!!
<otakon> MirrorImage: for a HELM
<arrowtobroknee> you called?
<otakon> a HELM
<otakon> not a shield
<SaLKiD99> Kammerjunk thank you
<MirrorImage> ok, so block his sword with your helmet
<EatPinkPies> If I had to recommend something for Pinkies parties, DEFINETLY WAFFLES!!
<MirrorImage> you're hard headed enough, aren't you?
<Darf14> If I ever hear one of them say that catch phrase I will attack them
<Nyria> D'awww That last NPC~
*IshBestKitty purrs
<Kammerjunk> Guys... I have a confession to make.
*Nyria pets IshBestKitty ~
<Darf14> ok confess
<Kammerjunk> Sometimes... I dream about cheese.
<arrowtobroknee> inb4mlphasskyrimreferences
<Kammerjunk> Cheeeeese.
*IshBestKitty rubs against Nyria
<Darf14> *GASP* CHEESE!!
*String_Shredder d'aaaaaaawwws at IshBestKitty
<SaLKiD99> the Gaurd said that there'sFur coming out of your Ears...
<Nyria> IshBestKitty is so cute~
<Ninjapony> Throw the cheeeeeeese
<MirrorImage> and failing those otakon, there's helms that raise the various attack stats (+x% archery, etc) or provide elemental defenses
<SaLKiD99> that means Wrek is a Khajit!
*IshBestKitty purr purr
<otakon> MirrorImage: no there aren't
<otakon> are at the very least
<otakon> there are none YOU can craft
<Butterfly_Pony> Awkward silence
<MirrorImage> i've seen plenty of Circlets of Archery, so yes there absolutely are
<thehated5689> khajit are awesome
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> CIRCLET not HELM
<SaLKiD99> i agree
<MirrorImage> and helmets can receive that enchantment too
<otakon> I shall check
<arrowtobroknee> *dangles string in front of IshBestKitty*
<MirrorImage> my Iron Helments have received archery enchantments a couple of times
*IshBestKitty bats at string
<String_Shredder> ow!
<arrowtobroknee> *pulls string away*
<MirrorImage> *the string bursts into flames*
*otakon pulls out the guide to check enchantment list
*IshBestKitty chases string
<String_Shredder> y am i on fire aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<arrowtobroknee> *extinguishes string*
<Ninjapony> I've heard that it is possible to wear a falmer helmet on top of one of the priest masks
<Darf14> lol, Derpy with a portal gun
<otakon> yeah
*String_Shredder lays down "i hate u broknee"
<otakon> nothing useful for a warrior
<otakon> except waterbreathing
*SaLKiD99 Divided by Zero by accident (can be stopped if wanted so)
<MirrorImage> yes, go show those Slaughterfish how to fight
<thehated5689> KILL
<otakon> it's ALL magic boosts or one archery boost
<Ninjapony> The one with magic resist is quite good though
<Darf14> wait.... was that a kid? 0_o
<Ninjapony> What?!?
<MirrorImage> there should be elemental resists though
<thehated5689> no one cares
<Nyria> Nobody cares~
<thehated5689> WIN
<otakon> Ninjapony: NOT if you don't use MAGIC!
<thehated5689> lmao
<otakon> damn
<otakon> I'm sayint
<MirrorImage> otakon - magic *resist*
<SaLKiD99> OMG the kids are not Immortals anymore!
<otakon> nope
<Ninjapony> Well, doesn't it resist magic damage?
<String_Shredder> agh dead body!
<PartyCannon> rofl!
<arrowtobroknee> you killed a child?
<thehated5689> 2 actually
<Darf14> Stop right theree criminal scum!
<SaLKiD99> BEARD
<otakon> You can only put Magic Resist on Shields, Rings and Necklaces
<ScootaChicken> Wrek you evil man
<Darf14> I thought it was impossible to kill kids
<MirrorImage> and even if you don't use magic, i'm sure you occasionally use Restoration Magic to heal yourself
<otakon> in the console it is
<String_Shredder> bumtazer is bumtazing
<ScootaChicken> I love you so much
<Ninjapony> I guess you can mod it
<arrowtobroknee> Kill ALL the children
<MirrorImage> there's Fortify Restoration, which is therefore universally useful
<otakon> MirrorImage: I do.
<SaLKiD99> what kind of Enchantment he used?! I WANT THAT
<otakon> Man
<thehated5689> no one gives a damn that he killed to kds and a guard, thats amazing
<MirrorImage> or, failing that even, Fortify Lockpicking
<Butterfly_Pony> lol
<arrowtobroknee> lol meatpies and dead bodies
<thehated5689> 0_0
<Darf14> HAX!
<String_Shredder> noclip FTW
<Nyria> It's magic nothing more
<MirrorImage> so for a warrior, yes i'll agree, probably not that much good stuff
<otakon> yeah, he's enabled console commands
<MirrorImage> that's not to say there aren't valid options
<thehated5689> bwah bwaah bwaaaaaaaaaaaaah
<String_Shredder> HAaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAXXX
<otakon> MirrorImage: true, but nothing to really boost a warrior
<SaLKiD99> what times are it in your Cou-OMG HE NOCLIPPED AND KILLED HIMSELF

<SaLKiD99> hmm...true
<[WERK]Yahooz> StinkomanFan: Fighting is Magic will be out soon
<Dken2021> because the synopsis would be odd to handle?
<arrowtobroknee> because it would be terrible most likely
<StinkomanFan> THQ would probably do it
<arrowtobroknee> *looks at doctor who*
<StinkomanFan> They made piles of crap into piles of... somethinfg better
*Ninjapony is fetching something to eat
*RainbowDash is spacing out
<StinkomanFan> Well, other than that OTHER official one

<[WERK]Yahooz> Deathnote :3
<StinkomanFan> Light's the jerk with the book right?
<Dken2021> yes
<[WERK]Yahooz> L is such a boss
<Dken2021> too bad he's dead

<[WERK]Yahooz> XD
<[WERK]Yahooz> Dken2021: its in the whole anime
<RainbowDash> i've heard of death note, but i never really watched it. It looks interesting though
<arrowtobroknee> I'd hardly call the ware house fire hilarious
<[WERK]Yahooz> people die left and right
<StinkomanFan> Depends on the victim
<StinkomanFan> Hey, I think a cloud moved
<Dken2021> RainbowDash it's an interesting anime/manga

<arrowtobroknee> and cake
<Shizuka> 13the game is paused... see those two figures on the road, they haven't moved, no NPC conversation lasts this long
<[WERK]Yahooz> Deathnote becomes less awesome without L in the picture, but the rest is still definently worht watching
<[WERK]Yahooz> *worth
<Dken2021> L sure eats alot
<arrowtobroknee> lol spike is best shinigami

<RainbowDash> arrowtobroknee: not yet....
<[WERK]Yahooz> the last ep is a giant "WHAT A TWEEEEEEST"
<StinkomanFan> Like every anime ever?
<derpy_derpy> I wonder how he got up there...I've never seen the town from this perspective before
<arrowtobroknee> oh you're stil on about death note.
<Dken2021> and probably after I finish it, might watch golgo 13
<StinkomanFan> He cheated Derpy_pony
<[WERK]Yahooz> alright im off for now. ill be back in about a few hours
<StinkomanFan> But it is a nice looking town
<SaLKiD99> there's nothing for me to talk about...

<StinkomanFan> Talk about how silly it is for Doctor Who to be a pony
<Kammerjunk> Have fun, [WERK]Yahooz.
<StinkomanFan> That always works
<arrowtobroknee> oh god what

*RainbowDash sighs as she starts to run out of ideas of what to say....and grabs a muffin and noms it..
<Kammerjunk> Muffins!
<Kammerjunk> I prefer cupcakes, though.
<Kammerjunk> Because you can decorate a cupcake.
<Dken2021> oh god, he's so in heaven right now
<Kammerjunk> oh u
<Kammerjunk> Well, I'm going to watch Quarantine 2 now.
*RainbowDash ditches the muffin for a basket of cupcakes and starts nomming

<Gumri> Why have you been eating off food?
<Altair> Hello Dken2021
<String_Shredder> it puts the head in the bucket
<Saturn> 8,1RAWRity: i think it may have actually been the 9 month old cheese
<Cypresswolf> 4 year old twinkies are better *no they're not*
<StinkomanFan> "Murder is the wittiest reply"-Yahtzee Croshaw
<Saturn> 8,1or the carbonara that expired a month ago
<RAWRity> Saturn: naaaaaaaah. It's most likely the 7 week old half-eaten cup of yogurt.
<Gumri> damn right it is :D
<Saturn> 8,1RAWRity: that's actually quite close to the truth
<StinkomanFan> Jump!
<Honey_Whistle> Anyways, I be alive.
<String_Shredder> "If it's alive and you make it dead it's murder"- Ian Christopher Duff Campbell [me!]
<Gumri> I wont eat things that have the current date on, let alone a month after
<Saturn> 8,1i ate a cup of yoghurt that expried 2 months ago, and had a pierced lid
<RAWRity> Saturn: I would say I'm sorry for you but...if you did that, ya kinda earned your suffering.
<Saturn> 8,1it tasted of mouldy cheese
<String_Shredder> lololololol
<Cypresswolf> isnt cheese mold anyway?
<Saturn> 8,1thing is, i only noticed it tasted of mouldy cheese when i was half way throguh it
<Saturn> 8,1Cypresswolf: some blue cheeses are
<Gumri> how...
<RAWRity> Saturn: are your taste buds broken?

<Cypresswolf> I love blue cheese
<Kammerjunk|Films> Saturn: But... how?
<Saturn> 8,1RAWRity: to be fair, it didn't taste very strongly of mouldy cheese
<StinkomanFan> Wrek would not do well with the CMC
<Saturn> 8,1and was lemon flavoured
<Wrek> 05speaking of lemon
<Saturn> 8,1and lemon kills pretty much every other smell
<[WERK]Yahooz> yes?
<StinkomanFan> Lemon par-/shot
<Wrek> 05i has rum&coke with a piece of lemon in it
<[WERK]Yahooz> nice
<RAWRity> Saturn: the fact that you didn't immediately hurl it up says nothing good about your self-preservation instincts.

<CriticKitten> Damn, the Force is strong with that one
<Randomnerd> No, RainbowDash, I mean *I* am depressed.
<Yahooz> why?
<DashWithRainbows> Randomnerd you read MLD?
<Randomnerd> Just now.
<RainbowDash> Oh.... okay.. sry
<SaLKiD99> i read it
<Randomnerd> lol it's okay
<DashWithRainbows> Randomnerd you are shedding manly tears yes?
<MirrorImage> and thus, Randomnerd's depression is understandable
<Randomnerd> The Manliest!
<Gumri> My little Dashie was the saddest thing ever
<Randomnerd> No, no... it was pretty sad, but I didn't cry.
<Yahooz> try reading Transcendence
<Cy|Nap> Gumri: No, my life is. xD
<otakon> waht wa?
<Ghosties> 04There we go
<MirrorImage> ehh... i think Trancendence is a little long for the Manly Tears effect
<Yahooz> waht?
<DashWithRainbows> Im sure there is a sadder fic out there but MLD is one of my favourites.
<SirSprinkles> 00,06...=/
<SaLKiD99> i wanted to cry...but then i knew that my father's wife (not my mother) would've heard me crying
<herostar> omg skyrim!
<Luna> 07,01flags really need to be synced..
<Yahooz> MirrorImage: it has those Man-Tear moments though
<SirSprinkles> 00,06They are.
<RainbowDash> :"'(
<RainbowDash> :'(
<Luna> 07,01why does he get auto banned?
<otakon> SaLKiD99: to what?
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Don't know why it only prevents him from coming in...
<MirrorImage> yes, but at the same time it's not from a first-person point of perspective
*Nyria hugs SaLKiD99 ~
<Luna> 07,01not across all channels though?
<RainbowDash> It was such a sad fic... MLD
<MirrorImage> or rather, not an unnamed protagonist one
<SirSprinkles> 00,06It auto bans if you're not identified.
<herostar> ohdearheavens not the sad fluttershy
<SirSprinkles> 00,06Oh, no, was going to do that today.
<MirrorImage> so the connection isn't quite as deep
<SaLKiD99> the part where Dashie runs away and the man is Very , Very Sad
<herostar> who's playing skyrim?
<otakon> Wrek
<Luna> 07,01Alright so what's on the agenda tonight?
<String_Shredder> not me
<SirSprinkles> 00,06...but once you're identified, even if you're banned, it should let you in, since you have OPs... =/
<SirSprinkles> 00,06So confusing.
<Ghosties> 04The document I drafted for you guys
<herostar> im playing on my xbox 360

<LordCelestia> 0,5Dawnstar is boring
<Ghosties> 04Thanks
<herostar> talk to him and do his quest, you can either get him as a teamate or get a magic staff doing 20-50 depending on if you steal peoples dreams with it
<LordCelestia> 0,5But theres a daedric quest there
*RainbowDash is now listening to Intensive Pony Unit
<Ghosties> 04And yeah, I only saw dusk_fly like three times. And that was at the beginning of the summer

<ValtheJean> 2,14 you don't
<Ghosties> 04Just let them know that they can change their name AS LONG AS it resembles their original name; as long as there is something that is familiar to it
<LordCelestia> 0,5It is!
<Yahooz> Wrek's? No shot
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he only sees the chat when he stops playing
<Ziltoid> Thats garus isnt it?
<Yahooz> Wrek's wired in
<Ghosties> 04So SuperBrony64 could change it to SuperPony64, or SuperBrony32 or something
<herostar> dang
<Cy|Nap> Mention booze?

<LordCelestia> 0,5Nope. Wood.
<Ziltoid> I think
<otakon> brb
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06One or the other, she can honestly pick, I don't care.
<NewDCD> and you guys reaaaaally gotta memorize I don't drive xD
<Yahooz> SaLKiD99 only the regulars have parts. I dont think you were a regular when this occured
<SaLKiD99> ?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 eeyup, that's the reason. I'm just an evil old guy
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06^ I know that feel
<Yahooz> indeed
<Cy|Nap> -.-
<CriticKitten> A bunneh?
<CriticKitten> :D
<SaLKiD99> Dovahkiin : Wuud...Nah KEST!!!
<Yahooz> random_bunneh.exe
<Kammerjunk|Reading> So, apparently, my country signed ACTA.
<NewDCD> so yes we're on the way home but I am using le phone...anyways! Infractions?
<Kammerjunk|Reading> So that sucks.
<Ziltoid> dohvahkin is such a fun word to say
<Yahooz> FUUUUUUUU
<LordCelestia> 0,5WAT
<LordCelestia> 0,5Which coutnry did this?
<Kammerjunk|Reading> Denmark.
<Ziltoid> poland?
<Yahooz> >:|
<Ghosties> 04Were you okay with the document I made?
*Randomnerd is having a breakthrough day.
<Ziltoid> I heard poland is in it too
<Kammerjunk|Reading> Aye.
<Luna> 07,01-Mod Infractions
<Luna> 07,01	
<Luna> 07,01Mod infractions can consist of the following:
<Luna> 07,01	-Abuse of power (which includes nick spamming, color spamming, msg spamming, bullying or hazing of certain viewers, attention whoring (i.e. trying to purposefully draw attention to yourself beyond normal levels of interaction with the viewers), etc.)
<Luna> 07,01	-Promoting or advertizing of other streams or FiM related channels within BronyState without the proper authorization of the admins
<Luna> 07,01	-Attacking other BronyState moderators or admins
<Luna> 07,01	-Stream jacking without consent from the mod/admin who is streaming
<Luna> 07,01	-No showing new FiM eps without giving a typed notice to admins
<Luna> 07,01(just gonna run through it)
<Luna> 07,01Any comments?
<Luna> 07,01suggestions / feedback?
<Yahooz> Why is the EU agreeing to this shit?!
<Ziltoid> its not
<Ziltoid> its done in secret meetings
<Kammerjunk> In the words of the Medic, "I have no idea!"
<Kammerjunk> Oh, wait.
<Ziltoid> away from the public
<Kammerjunk> I just broke the law.
<Krakass> Assuming you're in the EU you're safe until the European Parliament approves it.
<Nyria> That's how you ask a question~!
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14there ist no way. .
<SaLKiD99> WTF
<Ziltoid> dat moonwalk
<Kammerjunk> Dude.
<Kammerjunk> What?
<NewDCD> that's the document Ghosties redacted a few weeks ago, right?
<Shizuka> 13oh... this thread again
<Gumri> Woah woah what is EU messing up again?
<Luna> 07,01yes
<SaLKiD99> nope , he was walking backwards
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Shizuka.
<Luna> 07,01we're running through it now
<Kammerjunk> Gumri: Nothing yet, but we're getting there.
<Kammerjunk> 'Tis ACTA.
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/W6kEx.gif this thread is now about muffins
<Kammerjunk> Muffins!
<Nyria> yay~
<Kammerjunk> I still prefer cupcakes, though.
<otakon> oh yeah!
<SaLKiD99> if ACTA was Spyin' us , then how would they find us at all?
<Kammerjunk> Cupcakes are the master desert!
<Ziltoid> whats the synopsis for the next episode?
<Kammerjunk> SaLKiD99: That's another thing.
<Ziltoid> is it the RD one?
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06Again, only problem I had with it is that the part saying that they will have a talk with Luna and Ghosties should be changed to they will have a talk with at least two of the administrators. It'll still be the two of you most of the time, but it's just formality in case one of you is on break or whatever.
<Kammerjunk> It's literally impossible to closely monitor the data of every single citizen using the Internet.
<otakon> Okay, bread is in the oven
<SaLKiD99> only God can do that
<SaLKiD99> you know , see us all
<Luna> 07,01that's the second part
<Luna> 07,01that's punishments
<SaLKiD99> at the same time
<Kammerjunk> Soon, so can lobbyists.
<Luna> 07,01let's focus on infractions first
<Ziltoid> indeed
<Kammerjunk> Via 1's and 0's.
<otakon> eeyup
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06Again, have no problem with the infractions part.
<Ghosties> 04DCD said he didn't either a while ago
<Ziltoid> oh no wrek is sick
<NewDCD> well I remember being all right with it....gimme a moment to think
<Ghosties> 04Dunno if he changed his mind
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06I see nothing that needs changed, nor know of anything that needs added.
<Ziltoid> hmmmm?
<Kammerjunk> I mean, Google automatically stores all data entered by it's users, but still they don't actually monitor it all.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 inb4 IMMAVAMPIYA
<Kammerjunk> wat
<SaLKiD99> Jareera is a weird name , because there is a Bookstore called Jareer in KSA
<Ziltoid> inb4 betrayal
*RainbowDash wakes up with a start as she realizes that she dozed off...
<Kammerjunk> RainbowDash: I do that from time to other.
<Kammerjunk> Also when I sleep.
<Luna> 07,01good, I like it as Ghosties wrote it. no comments from me
<Kammerjunk> I keep waking up when I sleep, and it makes me believe I got no sleep at all.
<Luna> 07,01Waiting for DCD's feedback
<SaLKiD99> DECAPITATIOUNN!!!
<RainbowDash> Kammerjunk: Okay... nice to know
<Kammerjunk> I know, right!
*Midnight_Tempest pokes everyone
<Kammerjunk> Ow.
*Altair prods Midnight_Tempest
<Midnight_Tempest> O.o
<CriticKitten> Bloodband Marauders....I can't believe they betrayed you, Wrek, their name sounded so trustworthy! ;_;
*Dken2021 pokes Midnight_Tempest
*Midnight_Tempest is poked and explodes
*LunaTheBeloved pokes back
*SaLKiD99 jumps from the Dummy that got poked by Midnight_Tempest
<NewDCD> got something....need a minute tho
*SaLKiD99 pokes back
<NewDCD> go ahead in the meantime
<CriticKitten> It's the walrus! Koo Koo Kah Joob~
<Ziltoid> those are horkers silly
<CriticKitten> Pft, walrus is best horker.
<Ghosties> 04We're all good with it
<CriticKitten> ....besides, horker is much too close to hooker. :|
<Luna> 07,01Punishments
<Luna> 07,01Punishment for infractions of moderator rules follow:
<Luna> 07,01	-1st infraction: A private discussion between the mod who has made the infraction and 2 admins
<Luna> 07,01	-2nd infraction: A warning is issued to the mod from administration, and further infractions will result in severe consequences
<Luna> 07,01	-3rd infraction: Temporary demodding of the mod for any set period of time deemed applicable to the severity and nature of the infraction (this includes being kicked out of BronyState skype groups, and not being allowed access to the forum)
<Ghosties> 04So, we're just waiting for you
<Luna> 07,01	-4th (final) infraction: Complete dismissal as a moderator without chance to return in the future
<Ziltoid> no it isnt
<CriticKitten> It'd be easy to typo.
<NewDCD> okay so
*Luna holds
<Ziltoid> more like whoreker amirite?
<SaLKiD99> which Facility is more Evil : Aperture Science or Rainbow Factory?
<CriticKitten> When did everything become grey?
<NewDCD> in light of recent events
<CriticKitten> o.o
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: Sure, if you accidentally move your hand from the O to the R.
<Kammerjunk> It happens.
<otakon> hmmm
<CriticKitten> Discord strikes again :|
*DerpyHooves` dances on the chat
<SaLKiD99> nobody replies...
<SaLKiD99> ...but why?
*LunaTheBeloved is danced upon
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14i jsut dun kno wsa wnet wrgno
<DerpyHooves`> 08,146.9
<Ghosties> 04Oh Derpy
<CriticKitten> Oh, sorry, they're "Blackblood Marauders". That's even more trustworthy-sounding.
<NewDCD> I think we should add a clause concerning BS semsitive information
<Kammerjunk> I am trying SO hard to not go all out spelling freak.
<Shizuka> 13careful derpy~
<SaLKiD99> Chatters ,
<SaLKiD99> Y U NO Reply my Qeustion?!
<Ghosties> 04Sure
<Ghosties> 04Sounds reasonable to me
<SaLKiD99> *Question
<Kammerjunk> What question?
<NewDCD> be it project info or stuff like with...you know
<CriticKitten> ._.
<Kammerjunk> Oh.
<Luna> 07,01I do have a item for that
<Luna> 07,01hang on
<Kammerjunk> No clue.
*DerpyHooves` hugs everypony
<Kammerjunk> Never read the latter.
<CriticKitten> With one axe swing, you just knocked that dude into the air and sent him flying backwards
<CriticKitten> Good lawd
<Ziltoid> what question what?
<otakon> hi DerpyHooves`
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: His arm is augme- Wait, wrong game.
<Luna> 07,01Communication & Filesharing
<Luna> 07,01- make sure you inform everyone who needs to know about everything, even if you think someone else already has. It's better to be told twice than not at all.
<Luna> 07,01- As for filesharing, all movies and eps should be uploaded to dropbox in a timely manner, and images/audio/visual for projects should be brought to everyone involved in the project as soon as completed. And by timely manner I mean NOT on Thursday night.
<Luna> 07,01- make sure to record all BANS!
<Luna> 07,01- Who wants to sign up to help us retrieve the movie selection?
<Luna> 07,01-We want a rotation of certain ponies every week who are responsible for getting the files and putting them in the BMN folder.
<Luna> 07,01Please make also sure, if you are selected to check the quality if it's the correct movie / quality
<Luna> 07,01- Newsletter html uploads a soon as possible no delay untill the end of the week. [techies should get a login to check the newsletter pogo)
*Nyria hugs DerpyHooves` back~
*LunaTheBeloved hugs DerpyHooves` back
<Ghosties> 04Jesus
<Krakass> Why is Spike best pony is the question.
<SaLKiD99> Which Facility is more Evil : Aperture Science or Rainbow Factory?
<Ghosties> 04Dat wall
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Kammer: he never asked for it
<Luna> 07,01Information sharing
<Luna> 07,01- What happends between bronystate stays between the bronystate team unless
<Luna> 07,01- If there's anyone around that's not BS Staff don't talk about BS stuff
<SaLKiD99> that is the question
<Kammerjunk> What a shame.
<Luna> 07,01not complete
<otakon> Rainbow Factory by far
<Luna> 07,01derp brain
<otakon> the ponies!
<Ziltoid> why y no loot ring wrek?
<CriticKitten> XD
<Kammerjunk> I never read Rainbow Factory, but I know the grimdark part of it.
<Luna> 07,01first sentence is not complete
<NewDCD> sounds like you got it covered
<Luna> 07,01if you can help me complete it
<Luna> 07,01we have it covered
<Kammerjunk> And I'd say that GLaDOS didn't actually want to kill all her test subjects, she wanted them to further SCIENCE!
<Luna> 07,01for the teammeeting
<NewDCD> you're awesome big sister<3
<Ghosties> 04But we need to add that one thing to the infraction
<Luna> 07,01but I can also add it to the infraction document
<Luna> 07,01the big question is where
<LunaTheBeloved> Oh great......Tornado watch on my town......:(
<Kammerjunk> There are never any tornados in Denmark.
<Kammerjunk> And yet, we build them to withstand one.
<Kammerjunk> build our houses*
<SaLKiD99> although , GLaDOS is Evil for killing ALL the Employees with Neurotixin (except for Doug Rattman)
<Ghosties> 04-No sharing of BronyState information or material with anyone that is not a member of the team
<Ziltoid> There is no such thing as natural disasters in canada
<Ghosties> 04Sound good?
<NewDCD> "unless stipulated otherwise by at least two members of the admin team"
<Ghosties> 04What?
<Krakass> We get tornado alerts all the time here in ND. You learn to make sure your wifi works in the basement.
<otakon> damn it irc chat derp
<SaLKiD99> play Portal 2!
<otakon> dat derpage
<SaLKiD99> or TF2
<NewDCD> could be something we WANT leaked....
<otakon> hello InsertCupcake
<Ghosties> 04:/
<Ghosties> 04We're not doing viral marketing yet
<Kammerjunk> Salvê, InsertCupcake.
<InsertCupcake> oh hai
<Ghosties> 04We haven't even really touched on something like that
<LunaTheBeloved> Cello InsertCupcake
<Ghosties> 04So let's leave it out for now
<SaLKiD99> or , open the Chat Room in the Stream
<Dken2021> hi InsertCupcake
<SaLKiD99> making Chatception
<InsertCupcake> hello everyone
<NewDCD> yeah but I supposed that when Luna said "unless", there could be exceptions
<SaLKiD99> hi , InsertCupcake
<Ghosties> 04I have no idea what the "unless" is
<Ghosties> 04What her "unless" means, that is
<LunaTheBeloved> Dat pony
<Nyria> Hey InsertCupcake ~
<fluttercry> 05,15Her cutie mark was XXX hahaha
<NewDCD> I suppose it could be something like
<SaLKiD99> true
<SaLKiD99> we should rename Greenland "Iceland"
<Kammerjunk> I don't know why, but I suddenly got Comfortably Numb stuck in my head.
<Luna> 07,01I don't recall it... but either works for me but for now maybe; (No sharing of BronyState information or material with anyone that is not a member of the team) is the best
<SaLKiD99> and Rename Iceland "Greenland"!
<Kammerjunk> I'm blaming you ponies because it's always you ponies.
<Luna> 07,01we can review / update the document later
<Ghosties> 04Yep
<SaLKiD99> Startled by Song
<ekips> "what to d'aww" ?
<Dken2021> nah, I like them both named that way
<Luna> 07,01so just those two?
<Ghosties> 04So then I think we're good?
<Luna> 07,01yea for information sharing we are
<SaLKiD99> i wonder when to sleep...
<Ghosties> 04Also, don't forget that there's the asterisk at the bottom of the document and it states that not every case will be the same but these are generally the guidelines
<Ghosties> 04Again, as a mod your judgment is your best tool
<NewDCD> disclosing certain sensitive to a non staff member whom we want on board for a project
<otakon> Gilda
<NewDCD> but yeah
<Luna> 07,01we're not done yet
<otakon> draw Gilda
<ekips> choose a random chatter and draw him/her by the name
<SaLKiD99> 3:00 AM , 3:15 AM , or 3:30 AM?
<ekips> as a pony
<LunaTheBeloved> You really have a thing for Gilda don't you otakon
<Ghosties> 04That seems to still be encompassed with the rule
<Dken2021> wouldn't he need a reference?
<otakon> LunaTheBeloved: no, but he's NEVER drawn her.
<LunaTheBeloved> Sure......
<Kammerjunk> I've never heard this song before, but I like it
<otakon> Hell

*Randomnerd was away for a while.
<ekips> and i thought i had a bad hand-writing...no offense
<otakon> hi Toshatron
<Ghosties> 04Because I really believe it'll be me and Luna about 95% of the time doing the private discussion
<Gumri> me in a seksy pose?
<Ghosties> 04I realize that it may not always be that way, but yeah
<SaLKiD99> what did you choose...
<Midnight_Tempest> i think he should do a film noir pony, that would be awesome
<Luna> 07,01then again we will post all private discussions on the forums
<Shy> is fleur around???

<Luna> 07,01all discussions will be recorded and will be posted in the admin section on the forums
<SaLKiD99> @Wrek?

<Ghosties> 04Can't remember what
<Gumri> Andrew Bird? what?

<Kammerjunk> I would cheer if it was.
<SaLKiD99> 3:30 AM it is , then
<Luna> 07,01We decided to recruit forum mods and IRC mods.. does this mean that after BS 2.0 the forum mods lose their hops?
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Phantom Tollbooth
<Ghosties> 04Private discussions with the mod who made the infraction, DCD
<Shizuka> 13<33
<Luna> 07,01^

<RainbowDash> :P
<Luna> 07,01alright

<Ghosties> 04If we haven't told the forum mods that IRC is only temp, then we should tell them now
<SaLKiD99> why do i always get startled when a music suddenly begins?
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06We have told them.
<NewDCD> ohh, yeah everything cool <3
<Ghosties> 04But I think we have
<Luna> 07,01maybe we should do that...
<Kammerjunk> So, guys. What if SOPA and PIPA were distractions for ACTA?
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06Multiple times.
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, okay
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14anytihg i cna do to heeeeeelllppp?
<Shizuka> 13vivi und me should be the princesses of rhyme und reason~
<Luna> 07,01to avoid drama fest
<Luna> 07,01during the teammeeting
<Ghosties> 04We need evidence probably
<SaxyPretender|Food> 0,14...
<Kammerjunk> And what just if ACTA is a distraction for something even worse?
<Gumri> is this supposed to be Fluttershy` or what?
<Kammerjunk> conspiracykeanu.png
<SaxyPretender|Food> 0,14and then DerpyHooves` was Terry Bogard
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06We'll bring it back up, but yeah, we have told them.
<Luna> 07,01want to do that now?
<Ghosties> 04I say tell them again during the team meeting
<Shizuka> 13OKAY
<SaxyPretender|Food> 0,14^
<RainbowDash> No! nothing! for the love of celestia just sit there and do NOTHING!
<Luna> 07,01I don't know maybe telling them before the meeting would be better...(again)
<Luna> 07,01just as a reminder
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14was ist the entire world is a distraction for another world
<Kammerjunk> Oh, Goddesses...
<Kammerjunk> You're a genius, DerpyHooves`!
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06...tell them twice in the timespan of a couple days?
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14was if ponies are watching your life und laughing as a sitcom?
*Midnight_Tempest points behind everyone and yells 'Distraction!' then runs off
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06Seems a tad pointless, honestly.
<Shizuka> 13i do not know if i would watch The Shizuka Show .-.
<Nyria> Brillant~!
<Ghosties> 04Just in case
*RainbowDash O_o
<fluttercry> 05,15http://i.qkme.me/35mm2h.jpg
<NewDCD> so who are gonna remain as forum mods and who's gonna remain on IRC?
<CriticKitten> o.O
<NewDCD> will some be both?
<Ghosties> 04Kirz, Shizuka and Saxy, I think, are IRC
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Luna> 07,01Forum mods: LordCelestia/Slurrymoon/Scoot-Scootaloo/Fluttercry
<Luna> 07,01IRC mods: Nittany Discord/Shizuka/Kirzstryfe/Saxypretender
<Luna> 07,01Techies: Shizuka/Saturn
<LunaTheBeloved> Then the ponies watching me are listing to Andrew Bird with me
<Ghosties> 04AH, yeah
<Ghosties> 04*Ah
<Midnight_Tempest> i want my life to be a sitcom... that would be amazing

<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Eeyup

<DerpyHooves`> 08,14RainbowDash: . . . Flutterbutt
<Kammerjunk> This song.
<RainbowDash> no
<Ghosties> 04If our last meeting was NINE hours, imagine how long *this* one is going to be ;_;
<Honey_Whistle> I am making a series like Turnabout Storm, if you're familiar with it.
<Dken2021> are you now?
<Randomnerd> What the?!
<Honey_Whistle> Indeed.
<Luna> 07,01actually the meeting with Tobias will be short
<Gumri> This song makes me think about when i became a brony *manly tear*
<RainbowDash> if you give up i will tell you...
<Luna> 07,01it's just a meet & greet
<Randomnerd> Who is this?
<Luna> 07,01there will be more meetings with him in the future
<Ghosties> 04But you said the tech meeting
<Randomnerd> The art, I mean.
*herostar returns from his pc needing debugging
<fluttercry> 05,15This was one of the first videos I saw on bronystate
<Honey_Whistle> I am the writer, LavenderHarmony is the musician, and we... don't have an artist, unfortunately.
<herostar> owo!
<Luna> 07,01the tech meeting with our techies... I don't think would last 8 hrs... we're a small group.. it's not like the team-meeting this weekend
<SaLKiD99> this is not a Video
<Ghosties> 04Wait
<herostar> guess what im studying
<SaLKiD99> this is a Live Stream! :)
<fluttercry> 05,15Flutterwonder video
<RainbowDash> derpy. do you give up?
<fluttercry> 05,15not the stream
<Dken2021> herostar ponies?
<Ghosties> 04Wait
<Ghosties> 04Wait
<herostar> jus so happens to be art
<Luna> 07,01tech-meeting / team-meeting is different
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14RainbowDash: Ja
<herostar> both
<Honey_Whistle> Once the time is needed, I might need voice actors, and more artists, naturally.
<Ghosties> 04...the tech meeting is *next* Saturday, yeah?
<RainbowDash> DerpyHooves`: Ja? what?
<Luna> 07,01yea.. we were talking about that
<Ghosties> 04Okay
<Ghosties> 04So
<Ghosties> 04I don't have to worry about Sunday
<herostar> ponies art skyrim not picky XD
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14.-.
<Luna> 07,01it was scheduled for Sunday
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14I do give up
<Ghosties> 04o.O
<Dken2021> herostar oh doing that artist training grounds thing?
<Luna> 07,01but we are re-scheduling
<RainbowDash> okay. It was Pinkie pie...
<Ghosties> 04Then what about next Sunday?
<Honey_Whistle> 4 cases have been planned out. This is not a human in Equestria.
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14AHA!
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14I KNEW IT!
<Luna> 07,01Sunday is always problematic for Dari
<herostar> taking classes for art, i might be able to help in the future
<NewDCD> yeah...
<Luna> 07,01I was suggesting running 2 meetings on Saturday
<Luna> 07,01the meeting with Tobias is like I said short
<Honey_Whistle> They'd need to be show quality artwork.
<herostar> and pc classes, so art+pc=NEW ARTIST
<NewDCD> it should probably be a weekday but yeah
<Ghosties> 04So then the Tobias meeting and the tech meeting next Saturday?
<Luna> 07,01yes
<otakon> BEHOLD! My bread: http://postimage.org/image/gbuff3u0v/ STAGE 1!

<SaLKiD99> otakon : when i open those links , it shows me a blocked URL by the KSA Govorment
<Ghosties> 04And braveer was during a time when we had literally nobody in the channel
<Ghosties> 04Except for like two people
<otakon> it's BREAD!
<Ghosties> 04That's why we allowed it
<Shizuka> 13i have idea... wrek should change the picture of me so i am looking left, und then put vivi in <3
<otakon> goodlord thats horrible
<SaLKiD99> ikr
<Shizuka> 13so that i am giving vivi mein rose~

<Nyria> Chat's derping let me restart it~

<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06But yes.
<otakon> not pony!
<Ghosties> 04Should we allow NSFW?
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06No.
<Honey_Whistle> Anyways, 3 case designs had been made. 5 planned. 4 ideas. And a new "Sphere" mechanic that will have Twilight using a combination of Psyche Locks and logic, as I describe it, to find out when somepony is hiding something.
<SaLKiD99> Live Stream ,
<RainbowDash> :P 6_9
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06Borderline, yes.
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06But not NSFW.
<RainbowDash> fail
<SaLKiD99> Y U NO stop buffering?!
<Ghosties> 04DAT LINGERING TIE TO THE OLD BRONYSTATE
<Gumri> Everything needs more pony
<NewDCD> Well how about
<SaLKiD99> gonna refresh...again
<Honey_Whistle> 1 had been RPed.
<Ghosties> 04Fine, then at least let them call each other faggots and niggers
<Honey_Whistle> And it was a pretty damn good RP, too.
*RainbowDash goes to get snacks.... specifically TWIZZLERS!!
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06-_-;
<Dken2021> Honey_Whistle so is it game, video?
<Gumri> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD2TbtxjTho&lc=rMuIn_QPkaICDbsD-bBJQk_p1lPqrhmsDd4v69v2ggM&context=G2da42adFAAAAAAAABAA&feature=g-all-c
<ekips> time to activate second hdd until the stream is up again
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06I hate those words.
<Ghosties> 04It's an "anything goes" board for christ's sakes
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06Soooooo much.
<NewDCD> a silly filly room? A chat equivalent to Ghosties' proposed boards
<LordCelestia> 0,5Gumri i was pinged from that "lc" in there
<Gumri> ha
<Ghosties> 04We want to show the community we're not so damn stuffy
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06Ohgawdno.
<SaLKiD99> still doesn't stops buffering...
<Honey_Whistle> Well, the mechanic would have been added to a game, but it's gonna be part of the series.
<SaLKiD99> DARN IT
<otakon> for all those lacking in Vitamin Br>>>> http://postimage.org/image/57954tnsv/
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06I said I hate those words, I didn't say no.
<Ghosties> 04Oh, well
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06But as for the chat room... gawd no.
<Ghosties> 04Don't go in there then
<Dken2021> so video?
<Honey_Whistle> I'd explain it, but the Sphere mechanic is complicated.
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06Everyone would flock to it, and it would be an arse to moderate.
<Honey_Whistle> So yes, it's a video.
<Dken2021> ah ok then
<CeilingSprinkles> 00,06The anything goes forum would at least be easy to moderate because... it's a forum.
<Krakass> PonyKart looks sweet
<SaLKiD99> going to close the site , open it up , and seee if it doesn't stops buffering
<Ghosties> 04Yeah, let's just have an anything goes board
<Ghosties> 04Easier to moderate, like Sprinks said
<Honey_Whistle> I will also need voice actors, and I'm just here to get as much help as I can.
<Honey_Whistle> It's far too early to get voice actors, though.
*RainbowDash noms on twizzler
<SaLKiD99> Awww...:'(

<SaLKiD99> it still doesn't stops buffering , so i will miss the drawing of Fancy Pony :'(
<Nyria> Yeah~ Stream doesn't work for me~

<Dken2021> welcome back RawketLawnchair
<Gumri> I was a christian last month... no longer.

<otakon> Well technically Methodist*glares at LordCelestia *
<LordCelestia> 0,5^-^
*RainbowDash snuggles up in her nice warm blanket. "ah... mush better.."
<Gumri> I guess, just feels wierd putting it.

<Saturn> 8,1i'm an Onanist
*Nyria is Roman Calthoic~
<Dken2021> well do you appreciate god or deny his presence?
*LunaTheBeloved is Evangelical
<emangamer> Magical white ponies are suited for leadership; black ponies are suited to be servants.Stop learning! You will overcome any obstacle by resorting to strength in numbers (of friends).Girls that wear rainbows are butch.You need the government (ideally a monarch invested with supreme ultimate power and a phallic symbol strapped to her forehead) to tell you what to do with your life.
<emangamer> Seems legit
<Nyria> catholic*
<otakon> emangamer: woah
<Gumri> holy shit dat temptation to put brony

<LordCelestia> 0,5Diary excerpt: “I love wearing heels, it makes me feel like a pony!
<emangamer> Dken2021: No but something brought it to my mind and I felt like I should share
<LordCelestia> 0,5wut....
<ValtheJean> 2,14 old article is old
<emangamer> Gumri: indeed she did. She put the SMACK DOWN on her
<LordCelestia> 0,5She did?

<Dken2021> yup
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah
<emangamer> ValtheJean: I Know but otakon hasn't read it
<LordCelestia> 0,5Linklinklinkplz

<Dken2021> that woman was looking into the cartoon way too deeply
<emangamer> LordCelestia: http://msmagazine.com/blog/blog/2010/12/24/my-little-non-homophobic-non-racist-non-smart-shaming-pony-a-rebuttal/
*RainbowDash is extremely tired. falls asleep behind a rock. (still on the moon by the way)
<emangamer> ValtheJean: percisely
*LunaTheBeloved picks up RainbowDash and places her in a Moon bed
<Dken2021> way too much than what the general audience would anyway
<LordCelestia> 0,5Thanks! ^^
<Gumri> Im worried people are going to think badly of me now for putting atheist on that form, i know a lot of crazy people...
*RainbowDash snores in her sleep
<LunaTheBeloved> brb
<emangamer> Additionally, I’d just like to assure anyone who might still question the guards at the foot of the Princess’s throne that their colors were picked arbitrarily–and they are paid for their service.
<Phase4> hello again
<RawketLawnchair> Blah blah blah feminism blah blah blah.
<Gumri> Phase4: hello!

<Dken2021> lali-ho Phase4, again
<Phase4> no stream?
<emangamer> RawketLawnchair: Faust is a self proclaimed feminist
<RawketLawnchair> Impossibu
<Gumri> what is a feminist exactly?
<emangamer> "I have been a lifelong feminist"
<Gumri> i don't really understand it
<Dken2021> suprise you don't know
<emangamer> Gumri: a person who wants women to have equal rights to everyone else
<emangamer> Gumri: not only rights but be treated the same as men.
<Gumri> oh well that sounds reasonable then... Who doesnt want that
<Phase4> wow, flash has already died on me
<Phase4> didnt take long
<emangamer> Gumri: no one. thats why feminists are kinda out dated
<Phase4> "Feminism is a collection of movements aimed at defining, establishing, and defending equal political, economic, and social rights for women."
<Phase4> yep, they won
<Dken2021> well everyone ridicules it because the loud obnoxious ones (like that woman who wrote the artice) are always heard

<LadyCanary> And the happiness of ones heart.
<RAWRity> Bronystate Oscars. We take all the movies in 2011 that we watched, and the mods make a list of their top 10 A and B Movies. and then Top 10 worst, and we vote on them.
<Yahooz> Thats because its a sequel to perhaps one of the greatest movies of all time
<RawketLawnchair> I've never seen Ferris Bullers Day Off.
<RawketLawnchair> Ha ha.
<LunaTheBeloved> Babes In Toyland wins
<Cypresswolf> I didnt see alot of movies in 2011, and of those...I dont remember much
<RAWRity> then, after the votes are in, they announce them.
<LunaTheBeloved> That was terrible
<pinkydash> IT'S YAHOOZ
<RAWRity> I think it'd be a fun little event for everybody, plus we would make the mods remember all the worst films they've had to sit through.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...Babes in Toyland...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ugh...
*SaxyPretender shudders.

<RawketLawnchair> Where the streams at.
<RAWRity> Shizuka: if you're here tomorrow, you'll be here for the 3rd.

<LunaTheBeloved> I know all caps....
*pinkydash still has no idea what your talking about
<SaxyPretender> 0,14RAWRity, I have a question for you...
<RAWRity> also known as the WORST of the Twilight films so far.
<LadyCanary> Oh dear~
<Yahooz> ...
*pinkydash is lost under a rock :(
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: inb4 kick
<RawketLawnchair> By the way
<LadyCanary> I thought that was ALL of them RAWRity.
<Yahooz> you havent seen Ferris Bueller's day off?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Why would you pick that?
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> all of them suck
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dat aversion
<RawketLawnchair> I don't know if anyone cares, but I haven't been on skype recently.
<RawketLawnchair> Maybe I should fix that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd have to script my lines.
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: Breaking Dawn P1 is much, MUCH worse than the others. Trust me.
<pinkydash> eeenope
<otakon> also
<Yahooz> Great movie
<Yahooz> I reccomend you watch it if you can
<otakon> Frankie after the two year time skip is awesome!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ohai.
<pinkydash> Movie Night?
<RAWRity> while the other Twilight films were full of stupidity and misogyny and idiocy, but this one has all that AND is trying to talk to us about the touchy subject of abortion.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I haven't seen that movie. Throw it in the lottery.
<Yahooz> no
<pinkydash> :D
<pinkydash> Spam the Mods
<pinkydash> oohhhhh
<Yahooz> You havent seen Bueller's day off?
<pinkydash> I wanted part of this movie before
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No.
<Yahooz> Didnt you see the chat go crazy like 10 minutes ago?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes.
<pinkydash> no, because I came on 5 mins ago xD
<Yahooz> Its because they are making a sequel
<Yahooz> and it will be glorious
<RAWRity> The series that gave us sparkling vampires and Shirtless werewolves is trying to tell us about abortion and maternity. LOLNOPE.
<RawketLawnchair> Nope.avi
<Suinide> Im crazy?
<Suinide> Oh cmon
<pinkydash> and that's the trailer?
<pinkydash> xD
<RawketLawnchair> Or rather
<Suinide> :P its not that bad
<Yahooz> its a teaser
<RawketLawnchair> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wFSX7hH3Io&feature=related
<Yahooz> Trailer comes out Superbowl day
<pinkydash> same guy?
<pinkydash> now that would be intresting :P
<meh> hehehe
<Yahooz> yeah it actually is XD
<pinkydash> woah there
<Yahooz> the original was from the 80s
<Cypresswolf> Twilight almost ruined vampires for me. Until I watched the Underworld series and everything by Anne Rice
<Yahooz> so yeah XD
<pinkydash> he got olllld
<Yahooz> indeed
<Yahooz> alright, be back in 30 min or so
<Shy> I am a banana.
<pinkydash> okie dokie lokie pokie
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some say sequels are a sign that the movie industry is conservative with their movie ideas (as in, not trying new ones).
<Shy> WAIT.
<Shy> I am a pineapple.
*Shy disappears
<Cypresswolf> Sparkling Vampires - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-YZ1h1_Wvo

<Shy> I am NINJA.
<pinkydash> like the rise of the planet of the aps
<Yahooz> : D
<pinkydash> apes*
<pinkydash> version 2
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It could also be a sign that Hollywood is out of ideas.
<Yahooz> an Art Ninja?
<RAWRity> Anne Rice's vampires aren't exactly fantastic either. and Underworld after the 1st film is pretty lame.
<Shy> That too.
<Shy> =D
<pinkydash> they should ask Bronies
*Shy disappears
<meh> how to be ninja is the dvd for you
<Yahooz> yesh!
<pinkydash> they have tons of ideas
<Kimori> I dont watch suspense movies like that
<otakon> Cypresswolf: I counter with THIS! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl-7ZaHydUk
<Suinide> Why not?
<pinkydash> just look at the Fanfics, comics e.t.c
<otakon> BEHOLD IT AND TREMBLE!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The gaming industry has sequitis as well right now.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and now I am listening to Kiss From a Rose

<pinkydash> Call of duty 8 ?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14is amazing
<pinkydash> xD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and one of the few high points of Batman Forever

<otakon> I WILL be as awesome as Armstrong!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14(\ Flaria
<pinkydash> and that's part of the reason why we all love ponies so much
<pinkydash> ORGINALITY
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Activision is all about profit and franchise milking.
<pinkydash> ^
<meh> you WILL
<meh> YOU CAN DO IT!
<pinkydash> Same game, different skin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They'll drop it once it's dry (Like with Guitar Hero).
<otakon> hi meh!
<meh> hi otakon
<otakon> but sadly
<kirzstryfe> 11,14only reason CoD hasn't been run into the ground is because you can't drag+drop songs like Guitar Hero
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CoD is fun, but you can't deny that they are low-effort.
<otakon> I'm not seven feet tall
<Suinide> :/ say it like im a retard why dont you
<pinkydash> yeah
<pinkydash> once you played one, you've pretty much played them all
<pinkydash> espically multiplayer
<RAWRity> otakon: yet
<meh> eh whateverr you're at is close enough
<otakon> besides, I look more like Sig than Alex
<Dashie_Dashie> Armstrong is truely the only man who can sparkle and be manlier then ever.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Well, CoD is just a jovial hardcore MP game now.
<meh> ^
<otakon> hell yeah!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I'm not an MP fan.
<kirzstryfe> 11,14^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Especially of the theoretical anti-newbie imbalance of that game.
<Kimori> to each their own
<pinkydash> lol
<kirzstryfe> 11,14well, I like multiplayer games that require a bit of skill and cooperation
<Suinide> What?
<pinkydash> CIVILIZATION!
<Kimori> everyone has their own likes and dislikes
<Suinide> I know
<Kimori> wasnt trying to talk you down
<Suinide> The question mark you put on it made me feel stupid though
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd rather stick to killing programs then frustrate of getting killed repeatedly by humans.
<otakon> that's it!
<RawketLawnchair> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByLaRZqL4Xg

<meh> hi NullRadix
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hard games centered on stats.
<otakon> that MUSIC!
<pinkydash> lol
<otakon> Courage hundrefold, muscles THOUSAND FOLD!
<pinkydash> I prefer games with a good story line
<RawketLawnchair> Best music?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Most of my time playing BC2 consisted of complaining over stats.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<otakon> damn inspiring is all
<pinkydash> Chrono Trigger :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've jumped out of FPSs for the moment.
<Suinide> What kind of suspense do you like?
<pinkydash> lol I jumped out of gaming in general, I don't really play that much
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saints Row 3 was fun. I actually got every non-DLC trophy for i.t

<Phase4> hello NullRadix, night NullRadix
<NullRadix> *sigh* What's done Phase4?
<RawketLawnchair> Well, alright. Fair enough.
<Derpy_1337_2> freezer sounds like a fag
<Phase4> NullRadix: some boring sensor logging code
<Dken2021> and he looks weird

*RAWRity just got done rereading the first part of Dragon ball
<otakon> RAWRity: ah, good times
<Phase4> now to pony for a bit before moving onto the alerting code
*RAWRity really thinks it should have ended after Gokue beat Picollo Junior.
<Phase4> after a water break
*Pony_of_War wishes Dari would stream some Doctor Who
<otakon> me too
<Pony_of_War> I could go for some Who with the bronies atm
<Dken2021> yes it should
<RAWRity> Because after that, we got the Saiyans...and then Frieza and Namek..and then the Androids and Cell...and then fucking Majin Buu
<otakon> RAWRity: but I like Z
<Dken2021> but toriyama was asked to do more
<RAWRity> and then GT.
<otakon> no
<otakon> GT had NOTHING to do with Toriyama
<otakon> it is a bastard child of Z if you ask me
<RAWRity> otakon: Toriyama actually did write some for GT, as well as acting as a consultant.
<otakon> yeah
<Derpy_1337_2> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reYxSyENA00&feature=channel_video_title best use of duke nukem theme
<RAWRity> so he approved everything that ahppened there.
<otakon> but he didn't do it like Z and the origanl
<RAWRity> otakon: only because the last 350 Chapters of the manga had been nothing but editorial mandate.
<Pony_of_War> what is this i don't even...
<Phase4> back from my water break. water is good
<otakon> argh
<RAWRity> so as much as people dislike it, GT IS canon.
<otakon> Still, love me some Dragon Ball
<Dken2021> I really did like dragon ball, at least half the supporting characters did something, in Z, their just there
<Bravery> sup everypony
<otakon> well
<MirrorImage> Freiza ate a crab... wait that happened?
<vfvccc> is the stream down?
<LadyCanary> Yes

<RawketLawnchair> http://i40.tinypic.com/ritd7m.jpg Pony? More like Coney. Ha ha.
<StringTheory> DUDUDUDUDUUUBBSSTEEPPPP.
<RAWRity> Z was essentially "Vegeta and Gohan try to fight off the big bad until Goku returns from whatever has killed/incapacitated him this time"
<Phase4> hi vfv... he left?
<Phase4> and then my chat died
<Phase4> huh
<Derpy_1337_2> dat wood derpy
<Dken2021> the thing I liked about Z was seeing gohan growing up between sagas
*Phase4 is so glad he wrote the 'Reload Chat' code but so annoyed he needed to
<RAWRity> Dken2021: and STILL not doing crap.
<Phase4> that he'
*Phase4 never understood dragon ball
<otakon> I do
<otakon> well
<Dken2021> he's done stuff, like defeated cell...... and.......
<otakon> the original at least
<RAWRity> Phase4: what's not to understand? People fight and yell and throw energy at eachother.
<otakon> Z is a little too much GAAARRRRR!!!!!
<Phase4> RAWRity: i find that boring
<otakon> I shall scream for five minutes!

<Phase4> otakon: have fun AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAing
<Derpy_1337_2> Surprise
<otakon> at least Dragonball had lovable characters and good story
<RAWRity> Phase4: the first part (pre-saiyans) was a lighthearted romp for the most part, and was more focused on gags and stuff than fights, until the last couple arcs.
<otakon> and one of the best fights

<RAWRity> as far as I'm concerned, this should have been the last page of dragon ball: http://i22.mangareader.net/dragon-ball/194/dragon-ball-1949701.jpg
<Phase4> RAWRity: i tend to prefer storylines more than comedy, are we talking about the show or the manga?
<otakon> the manga was great for Dragonball
<RAWRity> Phase4: manga. Show was padded to all hell because they wanted as much money out of it as possible.
<Phase4> ah, well the show bored me silly
<Phase4> manga might be good
<Phase4> there hasent been a stream for 2 days, wonder why
<MirrorImage> there was stream earlier today

<RAWRity> Phase4: you poor son of a bitch, having to be subjected to taht song.
<Phase4> my brother has played it enough i've developed an immunity
<StringTheory> =/
<RAWRity> until Nicki Minaj released "Stupid Hoe" I honestly felt Sexy and I Know it was the worst song of the modern era of music.
<StringTheory> I don't even wanna know what that sounds like.
<otakon> I don't either
<otakon> thank god
<StringTheory> I'll stick with dubstep and stuff.

<Phase4> xD
<RAWRity> the difference is that Baby was just a bland, poorly sung song.
<Dken2021> sounds like if soulja boi was a woman instead
<Phase4> you closed it so hard chrome went with it
<MirrorImage> my god that Sweetie Deraille at 0:50
<StringTheory> xD
<Phase4> on the friday vid?
<StringTheory> What?
<RAWRity> "Stupid Hoe" is actively horrible in a way that can't be understood by most sentient life.
<StringTheory> No.
<StringTheory> It was that^
<Tovler> This song is actually worse than big sean's dance.
<RAWRity> Dance was at least awful in a way that you could laugh at.
<Phase4> dafaq?
<StringTheory> I don't see how people can listen to that stuff and actually enjoy it.
<Flaria> RAWRity: It's like I was watching a parody video made to be a parody video
<Flaria> ... except they're actually trying to sell this
<RAWRity> Stupid Hoe is just...you can't do anything but look exasperated at the screen as it keeps going...and going...and GOING....
<RAWRity> Flaria: and that's why Nicki Minaj is awful.
<Flaria> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35TbGjt-weA

<RAWRity> I've done it MULTIPLE TIMES as I've showed it to people.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14And you're a hero for that.
<Tovler> Which came first, this or Chingy's Holdiae Inn?
<RAWRity> Afterwards, you feel...accomplished in having survived it.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but I don't wanna dream tonight ;n;
<Phase4> i'm going to do what alot of viewers did (judging by the liked/disliked counts) and ignore that song
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and since nightmares are part of dreams
<LadyCanary> Dream a Little dream of meee~
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: trust me, you have to do it once. It's a right of passage.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I had my rite of passage already
<SaxyPretender> 0,14when I became a MOD
<Tovler> I can actually ignore the voice and pay attention to the beat.

<otakon> my ears
<Phase4> allso hello gmt-5
<otakon> god
<otakon> I can take this
<RAWRity> Because this song, THIS SONG, is what I point to when anybody tries to complain about whatever overplayed popsong they think is the currectn worst song ever.
<otakon> except
<RAWRity> You do not get to talk about bad music until you've sat through an entire BOTDF song.
<otakon> I suddenly feel like puking now
<Derpy_1337_2> Hasbros R&D Department http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=4MXa4L6-UpA

<otakon> damn it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14You know what?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Fine, I'll do it.
<otakon> I never knew noise could make me physically ill
<SaxyPretender> 0,14If I don't make it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I love you all
<otakon> Is
<RAWRity> otakon: that's how bad this song is.
<otakon> yes
<otakon> I knwo
<LadyCanary> You're my hero Saxy ;^;
<otakon> ogsd
<RAWRity> otakon: and i've sat through it OVER A DOZEN TIMES.
<Tovler> well... that wasn't so bad.
*SaxyPretender salutes.

<RAWRity> You can do this!
*Phase4 does not have a clue how to find it actualy
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<Derpy_1337_2> Phase4: no comment?
<otakon> how the HELL did you sit through this 12 times?
<otakon> this is the equivalent to the brown noise!
<Phase4> Derpy_1337_2: comment on what?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14It's bad.
<otakon> it's over
<Derpy_1337_2> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=4MXa4L6-UpA
<otakon> oh thank god it's over
<Tovler> I wonder if I've now built up enough tolerance to sit through Whitney?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but not in a way that makes me wanna destroy things
<Phase4> Derpy_1337_2: no, that seems about right
<SaxyPretender> 0,14more like
<SaxyPretender> 0,14this baffles me
<otakon> okay, back to FMA: B
<Derpy_1337_2> XD
<Tovler> Back to Dan Vs for me.
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: basically, that's how it is for me. It's the type of bad that inspires a world-weary "...what?" more than rage.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ahhh
<Tovler> Dan Vs. FIM is now the best tumblr
<otakon> RAWRity: you must have built up a tolerance, that made me physically ill more than anything actually disgusting
<RAWRity> now, if I weren't convinced that this was meant to be a joke by some kid with garage band, THIS would be the worst song I've heard: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdOrtleIg4Q
<otakon> I can stand the smell of 10K rotting chickens in the summer heat
<otakon> Fish bait dog vomit
<otakon> but THAT almost made me puke
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I find it odd that I can stand this, but not Emperor
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: emperor?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Death/black metal band

<RAWRity> otakon: you listening to that other song I posted?
<Phase4> redstone computer with 150 BITS of ram http://youtu.be/lB684ym3QY4
<otakon> I just don't like Death/Black Metal really
<otakon> RAWRity: which one?
<RAWRity> otakon: this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdOrtleIg4Q
<RAWRity> "Lincoln Log Holocaust" by Hello Kitty Suicide Club
<SaxyPretender> 0,14in any case, that BOTDF was terribad
<otakon> it's all on the left channel
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: just try to listen to the first 30 secs of the first one.
<otakon> and reminds me of a horror game from teh 8 bit era
<StringTheory> Dude. Redstone is love.
<Honey_Whistle-> Good night, everypony...
<Phase4> RAWRity: nope, cant listen to the helo kitty song
<StringTheory> Night Honey.
<otakon> night Honey_Whistle- sleep well

<StringTheory> xD "Night Honey"
<Honey_Whistle-> Live long and prosphere, as they say it.
*Honey_Whistle- shifts eyes
<StringTheory> Prosphere? o.o.
<LadyCanary> prosper*
<otakon> actually this would be good in a horror movie tbh
<otakon> or a horror game
*Phase4 is pro sphere
<SaxyPretender> 0,14MY EARS
<StringTheory> Is that like, a sphere that's a pro at being a sphere?
<RAWRity> otakon: no. no it would not.
<Phase4> squrs are so yesterday
<otakon> but that screaming in the left channel is annoying
<Phase4> squares'
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but I lasted 14 seconds
*Phase4 lasted 25
<otakon> eh
<StringTheory> Triangles.
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: not long enough. to become a true man, you must go at LEAST 30 secs
<otakon> I'm sitting through it all
<Phase4> StringTheory: wouldnt you be all for strings?
*RAWRity has sat through this one over a dozen times as well.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh come on man ;n;
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: DO IT FILLY.
<StringTheory> Wellll.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14NO
<otakon> RAWRity: HOW? you MUST have built a tolerance to it
*LadyCanary lasted...5 seconds.
<StringTheory> String theory refers to about three things.
<RAWRity> otakon: because I have a motto. If I'm going to talk shit about a song, I'm going to listen to it through its entirety.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3lQPCm0DhU
<StringTheory> String instuments, music theory, and string theory, the physics thing.
<RAWRity> plus I've shated it with others in order to spread the pain.
<otakon> hmm
<RAWRity> *shared
<SaxyPretender> 0,14my link is what happens when you take good fighting game music
<otakon> thanks RAWRity, the four horsemen would be PROUD
<StringTheory> It works so perfectly, I had to use it.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and add cheesily terribad American lyrics/vocals to it
<Phase4> StringTheory: allso refers to character sequences
<StringTheory> Huh? O.o
<Phase4> computer science / programer lingo
<RAWRity> Same thing with talking about movies or shows. If I haven't watched all of it, I won't talk about it outside of my first impressions of it, and even then will make it clear that I haven't seen it in its entirety.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ahh, strings
<StringTheory> That's why. I'm no programmer. Though I tried...
*Phase4 has to leave
<StringTheory> Nuuuu. Ok. xD
<Phase4> brb, about 20/30 min
<otakon> see ya Phase4
<LadyCanary> Bye Phase4!
<StringTheory> Alright.
<StringTheory> Baaaiii.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14later Phase4!
<otakon> actually SaxyPretender this isn't that bad tbh
<StringTheory> OH
<StringTheory> String.
<StringTheory> Character string.
<StringTheory> I remember o=
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the song is kinda in the "So bad, it's good" territory
<LadyCanary> Ahh.
<RAWRity> also, i don't know how Lana Del Rey has a music career.
<otakon> eh
<LadyCanary> Who?
<otakon> same way Jonah Hill got a nomination for a Oscar I guess
<RAWRity> lana del rey is the woman who gave us THIS performance: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zrvD-o8cII
<Darf14> *pant*...im....back -_-; *colapses*
<otakon> you okay?
<LadyCanary> Hello Darf14!
<Darf14> work.... to... hard....
<StringTheory> Whatever you do, don't die.
<Tovler> I'll now watch RedLetterMedia's long review on Red Tails.
<RAWRity> i hear Red Tails sucked
<Darf14> Hi LadyCanary
<otakon> really?
<otakon> I heard different from the usual source
<RAWRity> otakon: 33
<RAWRity> % on RT
<otakon> well that's RT
<RAWRity> otakon: generallys peaking, a score that low isn't a good sign.
<otakon> hmmm
<Darf14> dang, should have put Red Tails for B movie
<otakon> this girls not bad
<otakon> Darf14: it's only in theaters so far
<otakon> it JUST came out
<Darf14> ok.... never mind
<Tovler> The podcast I like said it was horrendous. The editting and music were even bad.
<RAWRity> more evidence that George Lucas needs to retire.
<otakon> eeyup
<Darf14> I concur
<CriticKitten> Then good news, RAWRity! He did.
<otakon> before he ruins more movies
<Tovler> I think he was just an executive producer of something.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: not really. He's just said he isn't doing Star Wars anymore.
<Darf14> Good thing he retired before he made starwars V10.5 with more Jar Jar
<CriticKitten> Exactly, so he retired
<otakon> gods more Jar jar? really?
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: Star Wars wasn't the only movies he made.
<CriticKitten> Because Star Wars is pretty much all he's actually directly done in the last several years. >_>
<RAWRity> and he's still working as a procuder.
<Darf14> Theres Indiana Jones
<CriticKitten> Producer, there, am pretty sure.
<StringTheory> Procuder.
<StringTheory> Yeesss.
<RAWRity> and they ARE planning Indy 5 from what I hear.
<CriticKitten> He hasn't written films in a while.
<LadyCanary> ....RAWRity.
<Darf14> At this moment if there is no ad for Indy 5 then its a rumor in my book
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: yes?
<Tovler> The guy who directed The Wire directed Red Tails :(
<LadyCanary> I did NOT just hear that. NOPENOPENOPE
<CriticKitten> Mostly produced. Only stuff he's written "recently" was the Star Wars prequels. Him saying no more Star Wars is basically retirement.
<CriticKitten> >_>
<LadyCanary> There are only 3 Indiana Jones movies. THREE.
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> four
<SaxyPretender> 0,144
<LadyCanary> I did not like the "fourth" film.
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: depending on the person, the Producer can have a lot of say on what goes on with a movie.
<CriticKitten> No, there's three. There's also no Last Airbender movie. :D
<otakon> you know? with the toasting the fridge?
<LadyCanary> Not this AGAIN Saxy >.<
<Darf14> Indy 4 is ok, its not bad but its ok
<otakon> ^^
<RAWRity> Darf14: incorrect: CGI Groundhogs.
<LadyCanary> If explosion then refridgerator.
<StringTheory> If potato then soup?
<Darf14> oh yeah, I forgot about the CGI Groundhogs
<RAWRity> there's a reason "Nuking the Fridge" became a new phrase for Jumping The Shark
<SaxyPretender> 0,14If Jesus then Aliens
<StringTheory> Yes.
<LadyCanary> XD I remember you saying that Saxy.
<otakon> what?
<otakon> no Frying the Coke?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14eeyup, LadyCanary
<StringTheory> Cocaine?
<Darf14> lol, NC Reference
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> good eye
<StringTheory> o.O...
<RAWRity> otakon: Frying the Coke is a forced meme if i ever saw one.
<otakon> hmmm
<otakon> maybe but I like it
<Darf14> yeah, even thoug his review was funny the meme was forced
<RAWRity> granted it's not on the level of cancer as Arrow to the Knee, but still.
<otakon> ah
<otakon> Arrow>>>>>>Knee
<StringTheory> Arroz.
<Darf14> I prefer Foh Shro Dah than arrow to knee
<Fleur> >>>>------(knee)------>
<otakon> Ar Row Knee!
<StringTheory> Fus roh yay?
<Darf14> hmm.....
<StringTheory> Hmm.. I wonder how many pony words of power we can create.
<otakon> no idea
<RAWRity> also, can I just say? I really hope they don't make Ferris Beuller 2.
<LadyCanary> Why?
<Darf14> ......I wonder if Derpy would be in the next episode.... just a thought...
<otakon> RAWRity: funny you should mention that.....
<RAWRity> Well, WHEN has making a followup to an older movie ever worked well.
<RAWRity> otakon: I knw
<RAWRity> that's why I mentioned it.
<StringTheory> Huh? I dunno
<RAWRity> Indy 4,
<RAWRity> Superman Returns
<RAWRity> Tron Legacy
<LadyCanary> You never know RAWRity.
<otakon> OOOh
<Darf14> Ugh, that Superman movie >_<
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...all movies that I had no problem liking
<otakon> we need Talladega Nights for B one day!
<Dalekkahn> Hey, the soundtrack for tron was great
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<Darf14> which tron?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Legacy
<LadyCanary> Damn right it was.
<Dalekkahn> Legacy
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: I do know. I know that it's only because Broderick is running out of money.
<Darf14> ok
<StringTheory> I have like, no clue what you all are talking about xD
*Pony_of_War enters the room
<StringTheory> Besides the Tron music. That music was amazing.
<Pony_of_War> I want a black overcoat
<RAWRity> taking something that's been around that long, and trying to modernize it, or bring it back, doesn't work because the way cinema and storytelling works has evolved greatly since then.
<Pony_of_War> so many mods, yet no stream :(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I haven't earned the right to stream ;n;
<RAWRity> So you end up with either a movie that feels like an anachronism that we can't take seriously, or a film that feels too distant from its predecessors to feel like a continuation.
<Darf14> wow, didnt know that
*Pony_of_War gives Saxy the left to stream
<SaxyPretender> 0,14woooooooo
<Pony_of_War> Now you have the left to stream saxy!
<StringTheory> Tron was still good though.
<Dalekkahn> Childish example that goes along with Rawrity is charlie and the chocolate factory
<MirrorImage> speaking of movies, when is the lottery this week?
<StringTheory> xD Lottery.
<Pony_of_War> Friday methinks
<Darf14> I think its either tomorrow or Saturday
<Pony_of_War> Darf...
<Pony_of_War> :P
*MirrorImage thwacks Darf14 with a rolled up newspaper
<Darf14> X_X\
<RAWRity> Dalekkahn: that's more of just a bad reboot/remake.
<Pony_of_War> If the mods would get the newsletter to the home page...
<Pony_of_War> Saxy...
<RAWRity> At the party for finishing of recording episode 307 Fluttershy just had seven tequila slammers and made out with a fish.
*Pony_of_War blames the mod that's awake

<Pony_of_War> You have to use it the opposite way you'd use the right to sream Saxy
<StringTheory> ... I should make a twitter.
<Pony_of_War> Try blowing on the cartridge Saxy
<Pony_of_War> That might help
<StringTheory> Did you try a hard reset?
*SaxyPretender blows on the stream cartridge.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14you know...
<Pony_of_War> The first part, before the actual "poetry" starts
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: because it's Paw Dugan saying "Ass" over and over.
<Darf14> This poetry is brilliant
<Pony_of_War> that describes poetry
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I think I should make readings

<Pony_of_War> That poetry was
<Pony_of_War> well
<Pony_of_War> crap
<Pony_of_War> But the first verse was ok
<Pony_of_War> The first verse reminded me of Bender
<RAWRity> I would hope it's crap, it's "Dance (A$$)" by Big Sean
<StringTheory> ... Alright, I'm bored of it.
<Pony_of_War> Yawp...
<LadyCanary> And now, he's something I hope you'll really like.

<Darf14> I feel like taking over the world... *starts installing evil genious*
<StringTheory> Hmm... They should do that.
<Phase4> awesome, all new youtube videos are being converted to webm
<otakon> umm
<otakon> yay?
<StringTheory> What?
<Phase4> i get the html5 player on most youtube videos now
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh sweet
<otakon> it's a video format
<otakon> but I'm not familiar why it's better than flash tbh
<RAWRity> after subjecting you guys to some not-so-great music, I feel I have to make up for it.
<Darf14> whats sweet? *gasp* Is it a cherrychanga?
<StringTheory> Alright.
<StringTheory> ... ^ no.
<otakon> why thank you RAWRity
<SaxyPretender> 0,14HTML5 is more lightweight than Flash, iirc
<RAWRity> so here's some good music: "Che" by Break of Reality http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSxqadOz4r0
<Phase4> otakon: flash is crap and requires a large broken plugin, html5 video players run in the same javascript engine that the rest of the web works on
<otakon> ah
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh shit, Sinfest
<otakon> then why is it every time I sign up for the HTML5 beta
<Shizuka> 13uh oh
<otakon> it SUCKS
<Shizuka> 13uh oh~
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ikr?
<Phase4> actualy runs faster than flash, doesnt have the same layering isues
<otakon> what Shizuka?
<Darf14> uh oh what?
<Shizuka> 13i wonder...
<Pony_of_War> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQPF-wgBGis
<Shizuka> 13what if slick bumps into storytime zombie...
<Shizuka> 13or..
<otakon> Phase4: tell that to my slower loading video
<Shizuka> 13FYOOSH
<Pony_of_War> Dat Electric Guitar, dat pipe organ!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh man
<StringTheory> ... Chrome has been mean to me tonight.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Sinfest has the potential to be very very epic
<Phase4> otakon: never had that problem, infact i have the exact oposit. loads faster in html5
<Shizuka> 13it already is
<Shizuka> 13deep character arcs everywhere
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well true
<RAWRity> anyone here read the webcomic "Blip"?
<otakon> Phase4: well, goodie for you. HTML5 hates me and so does Google Chrome
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but I'm very interested in seeing what happens with Slick
<otakon> RAWRity: I have a bit
<Darf14> never heard of Blip
<Shizuka> 13and updates every day... unlike a certain other really good comic who will remain nameless but whose initials are megatokyo
<otakon> ummm
<StringTheory> Google Chrome usually loves meh.
<Phase4> mfw pony is in most viewed http://www.youtube.com/videos?feature=mh
<otakon> no idea what you speak of Shizuka ....
<Pony_of_War> I wonder if I'll ever write my MLP+Doctor Who+Superman+Portal 2 crossover story
<Phase4> otakon: not a clue
<Shizuka> 13it's code
<SaxyPretender> 0,14he's technically the main character, but has had no spotlight for a while
<RAWRity> I recomend it to everybody. Great characters, great humor, and a very, very unique premise.
<otakon> eeyup
<otakon> I hate those damn
<otakon> well
<otakon> those damn bastards
<Darf14> so whats the basic setting and story of Blip?
<Tovler> 66 degrees at night!
<otakon> Darf14: you have to read it
<Shizuka> 13i wish it were that warm
<otakon> no spoiling
<Shizuka> 13i have to settle for a high of 22
<RAWRity> first page of Blip for those interested: http://blipcomic.com/1/
<Darf14> *sigh* Ok..... *goes to google*
<Phase4> why is this recomended for me? http://youtu.be/Awmu0-8aXSQ
<Darf14> oh.... that works too *abandons google*
<Pony_of_War> I'd be more intersted in a TARDIS
<otakon> Darf14: you have to give it a few strips, but it's good
<RAWRity> Darf14: it's set in our world...kinda
<Pony_of_War> Phase4 because ponies
<Darf14> Ok ill give it a shot, I will give it my 30 Pg rule
<Phase4> i must go, i leave you with this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zac3N7LHzK8
<Phase4> later
<RAWRity> 2 Pages in is where the weird starts, Pg 40 is where the premise is fleshed out, and you learn what the hell the weirdness was about to begin with.

<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'm really used to balddumborat's voice
<otakon> yeah, me too
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but I feel like what they went with in the show
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fits the character archetype well
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and as such, I'm ok with it
<RAWRity> From Trolestia Twitter: Applejack recently realized that sales go up when your store motto is "Bucking for your pleasure"
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD

<RAWRity> mfw I actually understood that.
<Midnight_Tempest> lol not me
<Shizuschlafen> 13staring at impossibly tiny wires (ALL your data goes over those things!) less than a few inches from your eyes for about half an hour each... not good
<RAWRity> College IS paying off!
<Shizuschlafen> 13this was earlier today... just still feeling the strain...
<otakon> yeah
<otakon> sleep will help with that
<Shizuschlafen> 13i think i may always remember TIA-EIA whatever the number is B... white-orange orange, white-green blue, white-blue green, white-brown brown
<Shizuschlafen> 13so like i said earlier as advice... don't buy flat patch cable... you will have a headache if you have to re-jack it...

<Phase4> soooo..... seems to be just you and me Fleur
*Fleur stares at Phase4 blankly
<Phase4> what.....
<Phase4> it is
*Fleur continues to stare with a blank expression
*Dalekkahn occasionally is stopping in to check on echos in chat
*Fleur 's right eye looks over to Dalekkahn while her left eye continues to stare at Photon-Phoenix
<Fleur> Phase4*\
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/z8yhW
<Mutterguy> helloes
<Phase4> ohai Mutterguy
<Phase4> so now its Mutterguy Fleur and i
*Fleur just stares at a wall
<Mutterguy> hurray
<Dalekkahn> Anyway, I won't really be talking much since I've got a ton of meaningless notes to take
<Phase4> what are the notes about?
<Phase4> hmmmm, my internet apears to be dying
<Dalekkahn> just boring notes for spanish about a spanish person we have to do a spanish presentation about
*Fleur turns her head and stares at Phase4 blankly
*Dalekkahn stares at the now recognizable female know to the bronystate community as Fleur
*Mutterguy glomps fleur and flees before knifes are drawn
*Fleur turns and stares at Mutterguy blankly as he runs
<Mutterguy> k, that's freaky. What broke her?
<Phase4> not sure
<Phase4> Fleur: http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1892/
<Phase4> lets see if some pinkie fixes her
*Fleur stares into nothingness
<Mutterguy> that might be as good as the intravenous antibiotics I'm on. oh wait. nope
*Mutterguy looks at the wall, what's there?
*Fleur stops blinking as she stares at nothing
<Mutterguy> Midnight_Tempest:, Fleur is brokened, what do we do??
<Phase4> http://xkcd.com/1008/ i love xkcd
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont know, who was she borked?
<Midnight_Tempest> how*
<Dalekkahn> Yes, xkcd is great
*Fleur 's ear moves slightly at the sound of her name
<Phase4> hmmmm
*Fleur continues to stare
<Dalekkahn> I particualarly like the math ones
<Phase4> Fleur
<Mutterguy> she just stares
*Midnight_Tempest pokes Fleur
<Phase4> Dalekkahn: the math ones i get are some of the best
<derpy_derpy> good morning bronystate!
*Fleur 's right eye looks at Midnight_Tempest
<Phase4> morning derpy_derpy
<Dalekkahn> and Fleur, if you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back into you
<Midnight_Tempest> o.o whoa... thats creepy... but so cool... *stares back at Fleur*
<Dalekkahn> anybody here read dragonlance?
<Mutterguy> I have previously
<Mutterguy> just the main series though
<Dalekkahn> I felt so nerdy, but so great when last saturday I was taking a computer science test, and one of the questions referenced LoTR, Merlin, and Raistlin and Fisban in the same question
*Fleur recites, unblinkingly "If you are to hunt monsters, take care as you may become a monster yourself""
<Dalekkahn> Someone should probably get some crucifixes and holy water for Fleur
*Fleur ;s left eye looks at Dalekkahn
*Dalekkahn 's left eye looks back
<Midnight_Tempest> so... she's quoting nietzsche now? hey Fleur... have a picture http://manticore912.deviantart.com/#/d4notcd
<Mutterguy> nah, we only need to worry if she draws a knife
*Fleur 's right eye returns to staring at nothing
<Midnight_Tempest> I have diagnosed the problem... its severe stream deficiency...
<Phase4> interesting fact about mew, the character data for mew is not stored with the rest of the pokemon but is actualy where the debugging code used to be before it was removed for shipping
*Fleur 's left eye returns to staring at nothing
<Dalekkahn> O.O that's cool
<Phase4> it was put in as an easter egg, nintendo wasnt aware of it when it was released
<Dalekkahn> although pokemon has been run into the ground so much by now it's sad
*Fleur 's eyes dialate and her muscles go limp
<Phase4> yeah, 5 generations is a little much
*Mutterguy does worry about the consequences of sentient icecream
*Fleur continues to stare at nothing
<Phase4> http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/ << is where i read about the mew info
<Dalekkahn> I wonder if fleur is becoming skynet
*Mutterguy hands Fleur some CHOCOLATE
<Dalekkahn> and if I ever coded a game for nintendo I would definatly put in an easter egg like that
*Fleur doesnt move a muscle, still staring
*Midnight_Tempest stands in front of Fleur, staring right back
*Fleur stares past Midnight_Tempest at nothing
*Phase4 sits down in the corner and opens his laptop
<Mutterguy> Dalekkahn: I got an idea, we need to hack her mind and break down her firewall
<Midnight_Tempest> she needs ponies... lots of ponies in the form of internet streamed media... also dont make her mad IF she is becoming skynet
<Mutterguy> yeah I dunno if using her belly button as a usb point would be pleasant. thanks for talking me down man
<Midnight_Tempest> o.o
<Phase4> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/678/
*Midnight_Tempest dances around doing a jig then explodes
<Phase4> btw, be carefull when looking for pinkie images on mylittlefacewhen
*Fleur 's eyes slowly move around slowly, independant from eachother
<Fleur> @____@
<Midnight_Tempest> O_O she's gone derpy
<Phase4> there is a certin youtube video based of a fanfic, nither of wich will be named, thats poluted the pinkie tag
<Phase4> my god, Fleur is now canon
<Mutterguy> she's been canon for ages
<Mutterguy> like 4 months
<Dalekkahn> maybe she needs a canon
<Mutterguy> you mean cannon
<Dalekkahn> ya, that
<Phase4> neat, i got google talk working with pidgin. now if only i had a need for google talk
<Dalekkahn> I know the feeling. I got my older sister to let me have her webcam, and got it set up with a second one working at the same time, and then I realized I had absolutley no reason for having them
*Fleur blinks and her eyes lock on Midnight_Tempest
<Midnight_Tempest> O_O uh oh...
<Phase4> you better be carefull
*Fleur blinks again
<Midnight_Tempest> well... she's blinking... thats good, right?
*Fleur blinks twice quickly
<Mutterguy> i think so...
<Phase4> um... i'm not sure
<Midnight_Tempest> once for yes... twice for no?
*Fleur turns her torso quckly and pops her back
<Shy> =____=
<Phase4> O_O
<Phase4> -_-
<Phase4> O_O
*Fleur turns the other direction and pops her back again
<Phase4> ohay ninja Shy
*Midnight_Tempest starts to back away slowly
<Dalekkahn> I feel like this is the Dr. Who episode midnight.
<Shy> why am I awake...? =____=
*Mutterguy waits in suspense
<Midnight_Tempest> I feel its more like Blink...
<Dumori> Shy as you have issues sleeping
*Phase4 is now afraid to blink
<Dalekkahn> well, just the silent person in a courner, then blinking, then learning
*Midnight_Tempest stops moving and thinks, then starts moving towards Fleur slowly
*Fleur blinks a few more times
<Fleur> Ohai
<Midnight_Tempest> O.o lolwut?
<Phase4> oh good, Fleur's better
<Fleur> I was meditating
<Dalekkahn> should we try to learn what broke her, like a debugging team
*Phase4 just relised that his internet might be out tomorow
<Shy> urghhh...
<Mutterguy> she's good
<Phase4> :'(
*Midnight_Tempest hugs Fleur
<Phase4> if its out i will miss the episode
<Dalekkahn> :( you will be missed at the stream
<Mutterguy> I'm going to anyway
<Midnight_Tempest> as long as everyone is ok and DerpNet didnt activate... we're all fine
<Phase4> you ok Shy ?
<Mutterguy> I wouldn't worry about derpnet anyway
*Fleur hugs Midnight_Tempest with a confused look on her face
<Midnight_Tempest> ^_^ hai Fleur, welcome back to the chat
<Shy> why was I woken up...?
<Mutterguy> Fleur, I was worried so I glomped you. hope you're ok with that?
<Kimiko> ohaey...
<Kimiko> I can still change my name... eheh...
<Fleur> hello Kimiko ^_^
<Dumori> I belive +d was removed as a cmode
<Midnight_Tempest> Mutterguy: just you wait... when DerpNet turns on and the world is plunged into Muffinpocalypse and all the Derpinators come out to finish us off... then you'll be sorry you didnt worry
<Fleur> yep
<Phase4> might have been me that woke you
<Mutterguy> I'll be fine because I live in one of the remotest parts of the world
<Phase4> with alot of sheep
<Midnight_Tempest> madagascar?
<Mutterguy> besides we'll have decades before derpnet can figure stairs
<bluestrom_S> good night all
<Phase4> hello bluestrom_S , night bluestrom_S
<Midnight_Tempest> but all the Derpinators can fly!
<Midnight_Tempest> they dont need stairs!
<Mutterguy> then they'll just crash because they weren't provided with enough fuel
<Midnight_Tempest> powered by muffins... infinite fuel source
<Phase4> http://derpy.me/z8yhW
<Midnight_Tempest> yay... muffins
<Fleur> damn you all
<Fleur> now I want banana nut muffins
<Midnight_Tempest> i didnt do it *cowers*
<Midnight_Tempest> actually... i think i did... *cowers more*
<Phase4> damn you Fleur, now i want some too
<Mutterguy> "	powered by muffins... infinite fuel source" <--- suddenly I think we're heading into Maretrix territory
<Midnight_Tempest> crap... i want muffins too...
<Fleur> muffins are not an infinite fuel source
<Phase4> think i have to leave soon
<Fleur> they are as finite as the wheat they are made from
<Fleur> that sucks Phase4
*Mutterguy is proud of his muffin immunity thanks to an almost life long gluten free diet
*Fleur thinks that Mutterguy was just waving his life long gluten free diet in our faces
<Phase4> that feel when your programing, you encounter a problem, then after a little thinking and ponies you find an simple, intuitive solution to the problem
<Midnight_Tempest> but muffins SHOULD be infinite... like oatmeal
<Phase4> feels good man
*Mutterguy probably is
<Saturn> 8,1urgh
<Phase4> ohi Saturn
<Midnight_Tempest> hai Saturn
<Saturn> 8,1my internet died
<Phase4> sucks dont it
<Midnight_Tempest> NOOOOooooo
<Fleur> Phase4 I had no internet at my house all last week
<Saturn> 8,1im on my phone at the moment, but rural scotland isnt exactly known for its wireless connectivity
<Fleur> I have no phone and am not allowed to visit friends
<Fleur> my TV was also down
<Phase4> Fleur: wondered why you wernt online... wait, what?
<Fleur> I could only get online from the college campus while waiting inbetween classes
<Saturn> 8,1ive traced the fault to one of two places: the BRAS server, or its associated authentication database
<Midnight_Tempest> lol... bras...
<Fleur> sounds shitty Saturn. I feel bad for your situation
<Phase4> oh poo, the b movie didnt get changed
<Fleur> so?
<Phase4> Saturn: bras?
<Phase4> Fleur: i've seen epic movie.
<Saturn> 8,1in the former case, all of scotland's BTw based broadband (ie anything 8meg or under)is down
<Fleur> daaaaaaamn
<Mutterguy> BT = British telecom?
<Dumori> yup
<Saturn> 8,1in the latter, all TalkTalk broadband throughout scotland and possibly the rest of the uk is down
<Mutterguy> whoooooooa dang
<Phase4> hmm, never looked to deep into broadband networks
<Midnight_Tempest> aliens...
<Saturn> 8,1BTw = BT Wholesale
<Saturn> 8,1bt =british telecom
<Dumori> more likely to be talk talk
<Phase4> Saturn: wait, what? its down for the entire country?
<Dumori> cos they are super relable
<Phase4> someone somewhere is loosing alot of money
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: scotland has only 1 BRAS. server
<Dumori> ^
<Fleur> Scotland is not a huge country Phase4 :p
<BronyKing> only one bra
<Dumori> Scotland needs some more infrastructure even then
<Phase4> sure, but only one? no fallback?
<Mutterguy> it's got more people than NZ though
<Mutterguy> ...I think
<pony_9851> quick question, is this IRC on canternet, or is ponychat separate?
<Phase4> i think ponychat is seperate
<Fleur> ponychat is its own
<Phase4> never heard of canternet
<Dumori> I belive so
<pony_9851> oh, it's what EqD is on
<Saturn> 8,1now, its not certain that the geographically closest BRAS is the one you use, but a BRAS being down still represents a huge problem
<Mutterguy> ok... a million more
<Fleur> ponychat is seperate
<Mixolydian> canternet?
<Saturn> 8,1i believe there are only about 7in the whole uk
<Phase4> wasnt aware eqd had an irc server
<Phase4> or room, whatever the term is
<Saturn> 8,1pony_9851: canternet
<Dumori> it has a channel some place I know that much
<BronyKing> eqds irc is noto as goot as bronystates
<pony_9851> just wanted to make sure. all i see is the channel (#bronystate) but nothing else so I couldn't see what network this was (IRC noob here)
*Fleur 's mind was drifting and she almost found her way into brony again
<Saturn> 8,1this is bronychat
<Saturn> 8,1eqd is on canternet
<Mixolydian> this channel is hosted by ponychat.net
<Dumori> ponychat
<Phase4> wow, bronies have 2 irc networks
<Fleur> Saturn this is ponychat
<Mixolydian> yeah, kinda sucks
<Midnight_Tempest> this channel is best channel
<Saturn> 8,1oh, i have is down wrong
<Mixolydian> now let's not start with the channel elitism
<Saturn> 8,1its ponychat not bronychat
<Phase4> 'i have is down' is my new slogan
*Fleur is on fluttershy.ponychat.net
<pony_9851> oh ok so it is the ponychat network at the bottom then, thanks
<Phase4> i'm on rainbowdash aparently
<Mixolydian> i'm on fluttershy too
*Fleur is debating on switching to celestia.ponychat.net
<Fleur> or luna.ponychat.net
<Mutterguy> rainbowdash it seems but I'm using mibbit
<Phase4> you have the ip for celestia?
<Mixolydian> do they have those servers?
<pony_9851> wait, can people in different mane6 chats read each other's messages then? i joined #rainbow_dash but then clicked #bronystate for the more general chat
<Mixolydian> i thought it was just like the mane six?
<Phase4> that was not a sentence i would have ever guessed me saying
<Saturn> 8,1anyhoos, so the BRAS handles your authentication; this sucks for me as i know i am actually physically conected to the internet, but i cant have my packets routed because im not authenticated with the bras
<Fleur> what people say in one of the side rooms doesnt show up in this room
<Fleur> that does indeed suck Saturn
<Mutterguy> no those are different, #[pony] just refers to the stream chat channels while servers also have pony names
<Phase4> pony_8654_: you can join other rooms, i;m in #Twilight_Sparkle but i could join #Rainbow_Dash as well
<Midnight_Tempest> so... can anyone tell me how the lottery works on BMN?
<Fleur> Midnight_Tempest have you signed up for the newsletter?
<Midnight_Tempest> yes
<Phase4> well that explains derpy's voice
<Dumori> x3
<Fleur> then you will get an email that has a link to the form that you fill out
<pony_9851> ah, i saw that post on facebook a few hours ago, i feel like such a hipster now
<Saturn> 8,1grr
<BronyKing> derpy was derped
<Dumori> inb4 Derpy is first canon transexual
*Saturn 8,1shakes a hoof at TalkTalk
<Dumori> ^
<Dumori> it's not the best ISPSaturn
<Midnight_Tempest> i see... i already have the newsletter in my email... but nothing else
<Phase4> sounds like someones just tripped over the cable connecting one to the other
<Saturn> 8,1if it were up to me, id buy my own DSLAMs and put them in the exchange myself, then lease out a line to the nearest tier 1datacentre
<Saturn> 8,1but that would be horrendously expensive
<BronyKing> why does #brony exsist?
<Fleur> there are two newsletters sent out every week Midnight_Tempest
<Dumori> Yeah it would be Saturn
<Fleur> the first with the link
<Saturn> 8,1BronyKing: it acts as a u-bend for sanity
<Dumori> If I could I'd get a unigrade conection for private use too
<Dumori> BronyKing it keeps the other channels more sane
<Midnight_Tempest> >_< i so confoozed...
<BronyKing> oh so the crazys go there
<Fleur> when did you sign up Midnight_Tempest?
<Mutterguy> incase a magic bot appears...
<Midnight_Tempest> i got SB64 to sign me up on saturday i think
<Saturn> 8,1phoneternets keep derpin derpin
*Phase4 has never liked wwan's
<Saturn> 8,1its fine in the city
<Fleur> so you got your newsletter on the 23th right Midnight_Tempest?
<Midnight_Tempest> no
<Saturn> 8,1but out in the land of manure and sheep, its not so great
<Fleur> then you got it on the 26th?
<Phase4> even in the city, latencies exceed 200ms round trip to the tower and bandwith is low. then again this is australia.
<Dumori> ^
<Dumori> reason 21 why I'm not an ex=pat
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah, i got the one on the 26th
<Mutterguy> which one are you talking about Midnight_Tempest ?
<Fleur> that one does not have the link
<Fleur> sorry Midnight_Tempest
<Midnight_Tempest> >_<
*Phase4 didnt get one on the 26th
<Fleur> next week you will get one near the start of the week and it will have a unique link in it
<Mutterguy> *Saturn
<pony_9851> so, do most people just hang in this chat, or go to one of the man6 chats? i'm closest geographically to #applajack but chat was pretty much dead so i came here
<Fleur> pony_9851 it doesnt matter which of the rooms you use silly
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: funny that, when i actually have a signal here, i get 130ms roundtrip *to a host*
<Midnight_Tempest> ok, thanks Fleur... do we get to suggest the movie and MLP episodes using the lottery?
<Mutterguy> no the channels don't relate to geography
<Dumori> te channels =|= the severs
<pony_9851> well, i know, lol, i just looked at the map on the site
<Saturn> 8,1the problem for me is the number of dropped packets
<Dumori> they just have the same names
<Phase4> Saturn: 130ms? i'm jelly. dropped packets wern't that much of a problem for me thoug, normaly withon 2k of a tower
*Randomnerd struts in.
<Dumori> but EVERY brony network more or less haves the frist 6 severs after made 6
<Fleur> Midnight_Tempest you fill out your username, the A movie you want to see, the B movie you want to see, and the ep you want to see
<Fleur> then they will use a random # gen to pick out of the entries
<Midnight_Tempest> cool
<Randomnerd> Hey everyone
<Phase4> turns out i DID get an email dated the 26th, but it was sent to the wrong address
<Saturn> 8,1actually, and you'll like this, that's 2/3my average ping *on a wired connection*
<Saturn> 8,1insanity
<Fleur> that /sucks/ bro
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai everypony ^_^
<Phase4> ohai SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I managed to get that newsletter out @__@
*Fleur throws SuperBrony64 to the ground and then hugs him while he is stunned
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O____O
<Phase4> Saturn: 130ms over wired?
<Randomnerd> Hi, SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai Fleur :3
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: more
<Saturn> 8,1usually over 200
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Do we not have a stream?
<Fleur> nope
<SuperBrony64> 10,02BLASPHEMY
<Phase4> takes 200ms round trip to the us here, 200ms within the same network is absurd
<Midnight_Tempest> SB!! SAVE US!

<SuperBrony64> 10,02NO ALLCAPS

<Midnight_Tempest> lol ninja'd
<Randomnerd> So, I met a woman, and I got her to watch the first eight episodes of MLP :)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Because I didn't want to fail school ;____;
<Midnight_Tempest> ^
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: its because of the funky way BTw does their contention multiplexing
<Dumori> the rules are no exessive all caps ot /me
<Midnight_Tempest> thats a good reason SB
<Fleur> PS3 = failing school?
<Saturn> 8,1the bottleneck is at the exchange
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But I would have loved to play games on it with you Fleur ;A;
<Midnight_Tempest> i need a tv so i can play my PS3 again
<Anthony> only 1 tv?
<Saturn> 8,1SuperBrony64: you should have looked down and whispered "no"
<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol why?
<Fleur> Did I just detect a ref from Saturn?
<Midnight_Tempest> you know... i havent had a tv of my own for over a year... im good with my computer tbh
*SuperBrony64 glomps Saturn
<Anthony> we have a tv in every room in my house lol
<Midnight_Tempest> oh Saturn, dat Watchmen ref
*Saturn 8,1hugs the crap out of SuperBrony64
<Midnight_Tempest> o.o omg its everywhere!
<Fleur> They will cry out for salvation, and I will look down and say "Tunnel Snakes rule!"
<Phase4> Saturn: that imply's a store and foward, wasnt aware they did that at those kinds of bandwidths

<Midnight_Tempest> O_____O stalk mode activated
*SuperBrony64 hugs back
<Phase4> Saturn: not sure what you meen by 'contention overloading'
<Mutterguy> /me hears Lyra shouting 'And kiss'
<Phase4> unless your equating them
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat Lyra
<Saturn> 8,1Phase4: or rather, oversubscribing
<Midnight_Tempest> come here big boy! *puckers up for SB* :D
<Saturn> 8,1they load way too many connections onto a sin.gle backhaul
*Fleur makes Midnight_Tempest kiss a large trout

*Fleur jabs Midnight_Tempest with an anti allergie needle
*Fleur injects

<NotYourAverageBrony> Last episode... I was not expecting Derpy to talk like that.
<SaLKiD99> i hate the ping while playing TF2 on the PC , too (i used to play it , WAY long ago)
<NotYourAverageBrony> That kinda freaked me out.

<Dken2021> ?
<NotYourAverageBrony> wait... wait.. hold up... stop... no....
<Sumica> 00,10It's what I expected her to sound like, sadly I got used to the fan voice for her.
<derpy_derpy> I didn't like the voice...she sounds mentally challenged
<NotYourAverageBrony> They made her male for the show??
<Sumica> 00,10no
<Dken2021> "I brought you a letter!"
<Dken2021> I like the fan voice too
<dashie> i think they might change her sound after what happened

<Tovler> so Epic Movie is basically 2006 pop culture: The movie.
*Phase4 has bugger all internet :(
<Phase4> Tovler: 2006 bad pop culture: the movie
<Dken2021> that's pretty much all the movie parodies
<Tovler> It'll be depressing to see how little we've evolved in 5+ years.
<Tovler> I haven't seen a good movie parody since Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story
<Phase4> yfw it was made in 2007
<Phase4> Ratings: 2.2/10 from 59,469 users
<Phase4> "In the past 10 years, I've probably seen more than 200 movies at theaters. This is the first movie that I've ever walked out on. 45 minutes in, I couldn't handle the torture anymore. This is the most unfunny piece of garbage I've ever seen. Although, I did get a good chuckle when about 50% of the audience had left before the halfway mark."
<Phase4> aparently it sucks
<Dken2021> lol
<Tovler> I've never finished Epic Movie either.
<Sumica> 00,10So what to stream.....

<Sumica> 00,10aye it is kinda loud

<Sumica> 00,10He always had a shaved head.
<SaLKiD99> true
<Sumica> 00,10but inorder to stay hidden he let it grow out
<NotYourAverageBrony> I know. I've only seen him with a shaved head. thats why I thought it was of odd that he had hair
<JumpingJoysticks> Have you seen all the epps?
<NotYourAverageBrony> me?
<SaLKiD99> AZURA!!
<JumpingJoysticks> yushums

<MrPoniator> Oh, that one
<NotYourAverageBrony> and after about 5 minutes the wall of fire falla appart from the burning rope.. haha

<Sumica> 00,10its chains not rope
<NotYourAverageBrony> ohh. ok makes more sense
<Tovler> mah boi
<JumpingJoysticks> How do you burn chains, after they've been in water the entire time
<derpy_derpy> this is where they all will die
<Sumica> 00,10coat them in oil
<JumpingJoysticks> The oil would wash off
<NotYourAverageBrony> they are all benders of logic in some form or another it seems. why not?
<derpy_derpy> magnesium coating
<Sumica> 00,10iroh you are not a jedi
<SaLKiD99> he's tricking her!
<JumpingJoysticks> They knew about it back then?
<NotYourAverageBrony> heat the atoms around the chains to ignite.
<JumpingJoysticks> Magnesium coating that is
<SaLKiD99> it's so obvious...
<derpy_derpy> magix
<Tovler> Whale blubber, maybe?
<JumpingJoysticks> AHHH MAGIX, that's it clearly
*Tovler can't wait for Ron Paul to legalized whaling

<JumpingJoysticks> Way to piss a chick off
<Dken2021> drama?
<Tovler> chekhov's snacks disappointed me.

<NotYourAverageBrony> kind unfair for fire... seeing as they have air,water, and earth against them..
<Dken2021> sleep chating as usual?
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02Tabitha is a SILLY FILLY :3
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02Also
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02Zzzz...
<Tovler> We got lucky. They could have used an actual male to voice Derpy.
<derpy_derpy> these tanks are cool...I want one
<SaLKiD99> FILLY MAYS
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02ZING
<SaLKiD99> TANKS?!
<Sumica> 00,10goddzilla!
<NotYourAverageBrony> what the hell is the moss man?
<derpy_derpy> I hope they make it sound more female next time
<derpy_derpy> hippies
<NotYourAverageBrony> must be seaweed
<NotYourAverageBrony> or hemp
<Tovler> too late. I bet most of Season 3 has already been voiced.
<Sumica> 00,10dad's a baws
<NotYourAverageBrony> really fire clan? wood?? are you kidding me? forge some steel with your "fire"
<Dashie_Dashie> suddenly Cid, from FF
<derpy_derpy> so they have a contract for the second half of season 3?
<SaLKiD99> Nick Toons are probably like "Screw your Mechanics , History! Fire Nation can make Tanks!"
<ekips> isnt it strange that no one ever dies in these battles?
<Jim> Your idea was bombs?
<Tovler> It was implied at Bronycon that Season 3 would be full length
<Dken2021> kid friendly kinda ruins wars
<derpy_derpy> hm...
<NotYourAverageBrony> they people frozen like that will die of hypothermia..
<NotYourAverageBrony> so death is there
<Sumica> 00,10pull pin then throw
<derpy_derpy> dad died
<SaLKiD99> First Death!
<JumpingJoysticks> Nope
<SaLKiD99> ...Ever
<Jim> I know right, Dken2021, They've got swords, and they just punch them
<OneTrickPony> he took a firebolt to the knee
<JumpingJoysticks> Oh shut up
<OneTrickPony> lol
<Lasharus> Afternoon all.
<Dken2021> ohey OneTrickPony
<OneTrickPony> hey
<Jim> Hai Lasharus
<Dken2021> and hey Lasharus
<NotYourAverageBrony> just looked like a scratch. how is he hurt that badly?
<SaLKiD99> hi Lasharus and OneTrickPony
<Dken2021> and now it's sokka's time to shine
<Jim> hai OneTrickPony
<SaLKiD99> HE'S ALIVE!
<JumpingJoysticks> "Dont be crazy saka, your a fucking failure
<SaLKiD99> lol
<derpy_derpy> can't find any concrete evidence for season 3...so the bronycon thing is all we have
<SaLKiD99> some MLP : FiM Staff Confirmed it
<Sumica> 00,10seems the town took a holiday
<derpy_derpy> hmhm
<SaLKiD99> i've read teh interwebz
<Tovler> We'll have to wait for another Amy Keating Rogers email
<NotYourAverageBrony> there has to be a season 3, because how will season 4 exist with no 3?
<SaLKiD99> WTF
<JumpingJoysticks> Clearly there all in madagascar where the lethal deseases can't get them
<Dken2021> lol NotYourAverageBrony
<derpy_derpy> season 3 has 12 confirmend episodes so far
<Dashie_Dashie> MLP: FiM is the most popular out of all the series and the fans keep it alive with their ideas, hasbro listens to their fans and incorperate their ideas into their show, I'm most positive there will be a season 3.
<NotYourAverageBrony> its true, isnt it?
<Sumica> 00,10good thing the bomb trucks did't get shot at all
<derpy_derpy> the rest is darkness
<JumpingJoysticks> Yeah it's true, they've even had an unvieling of season 3
<Lasharus> You mean the bomb trucks that would've gone up in a huge fireball at the lightest touch Sumica?
<Tovler> They still need to do the eat-healthy episode where Pinkie gains a ton of weight.
<Sumica> 00,10exactly
<Jim> That would be cool
<derpy_derpy> hasbro sells to kids...the fandom wasn't planned and no marketing plan for it is implemented afaik
<SaLKiD99> Fire Lord is Trolling Avatar!
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 10,02Zzz...
<JumpingJoysticks> I bought some pinkie pie crackers today

<JumpingJoysticks> No it's definitely not a tarp

<JumpingJoysticks> Fuck why can they firebend underground? Where is logic, did they eat it?
<TrixieMuffin> The moon is a singular spirit , not compatible with the sun , thus blockage , the earth on the other hoof acts as a conduit , thus firebending a t night
<SaLKiD99> brb
<Sumica> 00,10suddnly
<Tovler> Firebenders are goblins?

<NewDCD> 09,01SHAKE SHAKE
<NewDCD> 09,01just like Mischief Makers
<MrPoniator> Yeah, if you get the right screen/tv, the input lag isn't that horrible. But I like playing old consoles (SNES is off-screen), and also that wii is pretty nice with that
*Phase4 hates crt's
<NewDCD> 09,01dat pretty much perfect victory

<Gumri> oh dear Fleur don't go and get insomnia like i did
*Fleur nuzzles into Sumica again and tries to take a nap
<Fleur> Gumri I have had insomnia for as long as I can remember
<TrixieMuffin> How abaout for next week : A: 300 , B: Meet the Spartans
<Dken2021> oh my
<Simon> I prefer 300
<Randomnerd> So they moved BronyCon to New Spursey.
<Fleur> that is not how it works TrixieMuffin, you silly filly
<Randomnerd> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Dken2021> don't like either of those films
<Simon> Meet the spartans, oh god, it's bad enough that they air it on TV
<Tovler> another double B movie night
<Fleur> what are we watching?
<Randomnerd> But it is at the Meadowlands :D
<Gumri> Meet the spartans is the besst film ever
<Simon2> I got School ELA while the stream is on :[
<Fleur> well, that is arguable Gumri but I do like it ^_^
<Gumri> no, the best film is Monty Python and the holy grail.
<Dashie_Dashie> Takes 4 hours to get to Medowlands from where I live, and lucky me I know how to get there :>
<Fleur> where?
<Dashie_Dashie> Went to MLG medowlands for a tournment few years ago :>
<Fleur> where is medowlands?
<Dashie_Dashie> New Jersey
<Fleur> sorry I asked
<Fleur> :p
<Dashie_Dashie> XD
<Dashie_Dashie> Mfw Jersey shore cast are bronies.
<Gumri> what now? :|
<Gumri> oh sorry im an idiot ignore me :D
<Polaris> PONYS FTW
<Fleur> oh my god I just imagined an MLG tourny populated with people that go by names like "The Situation"
*Fleur just vomited a little
<Jim> Eeeyup
<Gumri> ugh
<Dashie_Dashie> LOL
<Gumri> What graphics card is SB using?
<Polaris> so is the next episode episode 15?
<Fleur> That would be the most annoying fucking place on earth. You are winning 1k-5 and one of them gets a point making it 1k-6. Suddenly the entire team of Situations jumps up and goes OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! WHAT NOW!?
<Dken2021> that would be annoying
<Fleur> and then they make themselves look like complete ass'
<Gumri> Something tells me you have seen several episodes of that Fleur :P
<Dashie_Dashie> ^^^^
<Fleur> indeed Gumri. I always give every show a 4 episode minimum
<Fleur> before I will allow myself to hate it
<Tovler> even Whitney?
<Fleur> that way I can say I dont just blindly hate it
<Fleur> I havent seen Whitney so I dont have an oppinion about it
<Gumri> I do too, usually at least but not for that. I saw one and then i understood everything
<Dashie_Dashie> WOW
*Fleur is surprised she had the willpower to sit through 4 hour long eps of that crap
<Gumri> it's impressive to say the least.
<Dashie_Dashie> Kim Schmitz, owner of megaupload got 50 years in prison for sharing digital archives.
<Gumri> holy shit!
<Gumri> really?
<Dashie_Dashie> yeah I just read it.
<OneTrickPony2> hey guys
<Gumri> hey OneTrickPony
<Dashie_Dashie> This government.. so silly.
<Tovler> wow. judge jury and executioner
*Fleur holds up her shirt to show off her abs while grining and nodding her head like a retarded jackass
<Dashie_Dashie> unce unce unce unce unce unce
<Tovler> whoa. you have abs?
<Gumri> Dashie_Dashie: i believe the company was from New Zeland but im not certain about that.
<OneTrickPony2> lol im on my ipod at school i cant believe this is working
<Tarkuranach> lol
<Dken2021> secret pony chat fun
<Gumri> somehow i can imagine someone doing that Fleur :D
<Fleur> they do
<Fleur> he goes by the name "The Situation"
<Fleur> I shit you not
<Gumri> I know that much
<Tovler> If I had abs... I dunno if I can blame them
<Gumri> Is this game black ops?
<Fleur> wear tighter shirts. Dont just walk around holding your shirt up like some sort of social failure
<Cy`> Looks liek it
<d3rpy> who is playing COD? O_o
<Cy`> like*
<RawketLawnchair> Bluh
<RawketLawnchair> What's going on here now?
<Gumri> they are social failures though
<d3rpy> looks like mw3
<Fleur> exactly
<d3rpy> thats is so mw3
<Fleur> All CoDs look the same to me
<arrowtobroknee> are there 87 people here or 23?
<Gumri> We are somehow talking about Jerzey shore RawketLawnchair, not so sure how that happend/
<Gumri> Suddenly Wii
<Tovler> o look, this again.
<Simon2> lol
<RawketLawnchair> Oh. Well, there you are.
<Fleur> Medow somethingorother
<Fleur> that is how
<Dashie_Dashie> Medowlands
<OneTrickPony2> brb
<Dashie_Dashie> lolwut
<Fleur> what Dashie_Dashie said
<Gumri> MLG medowlands with Jerzy Shore people :D
<Fleur> ^

<ScootaChicken> hey Yellowquiet
<ScootaChicken> hey Ingwaz
<Gumri> bugeyes8: people with a @, % or + mods and everyone else is awesome.
<Ingwaz> bugeyes8: we're all important here, bronies are family, if you mean mods and admins, anyone whos name is in the chat list and has a @ or % next to their name is a mod i believe
<ScootaChicken> wait, morning?
<Ingwaz> + sign i'm not so sure on
*Randomnerd now looking up hotels in Seacaucus.
<Dken2021> well I'm the most imortant person here /sarcasm
<ScootaChicken> lolwut
<Radu> I told someone I never read FiM fanfics. He told me I wasn't a brony. Is that true?
<prince-dari> ^ Lol no
<Gumri> no
<Ingwaz> of course not radu
<Randomnerd> Of course not
<Yellowquiet> laggie sonic
<bugeyes8> No, but i would reccomend My little dashie at least.
<Dken2021> and then dari comes
<ScootaChicken> lolnope Radu
<Randomnerd> Do you like brightly colored ponies?
<Ingwaz> i dont read many fanfics, i do read a few though
<arrowtobroknee> nah Radu, just watch the show and like it.
<ScootaChicken> ohai dari ^_^
<prince-dari> Hey
<Radu> Thanks, screenied c:
<MirrorImage> Radu - all that means is you haven't faced the initiation tests - Cupcakes and My Little Dashie
<Randomnerd> Ignore that.
<bugeyes8> Everyone is a brony until proven otherwise to me.
<Ingwaz> main reason i dont read too many fanfics is the psychologically shattering grimdark or sad ones and all the shipping that goes on in between
<ScootaChicken> we don't mention that first fic you mentioned here MirrorImage
<Gumri> don't read cupcakes.
<Radu> Never gonna read the first one, but planning on reading the second
<arrowtobroknee> it was a watershed moment
<Ingwaz> MirrorImage: i refuse to read the unspeakable fan fic, i've seen and heard enough of it as is
<Fleur> dont even bring that fic up in here
<Gumri> My little dashie is so damn sad.
<MirrorImage> hey, at least i didn't mention the big mac version
<Dken2021> reason for not reading fanfics: some fans seem to be ship crazy
<Yellowquiet> my little dashie is rly good
<Fleur> people have gotten banned just for mentioning it
<Ingwaz> indeed Dken2021
<ScootaChicken> urgh, I'm stuck at school for the next five hours :(
<prince-dari> Read My Little Dashie for lulz
<prince-dari> :P
<arrowtobroknee> C******s is horrific though
<Gumri> how are you online ScootaChicken
<Tovler> I've watched cupcakes. I no longer need to read it.
<ScootaChicken> Gumri, school computers
<Ingwaz> although i have recently picked up a ship fic, the rason i am reading it is is more of a comedy/slice of life, and what shipping there is is done very tastefully
<bugeyes8> I have read it-that-shall-not-be-named, and i must just be really desenitized to violence, because it didn't bother me.
<Yellowquiet> black ops
<arrowtobroknee> and back to CoD
<Gumri> Oh! We would have had this site filtered
<ScootaChicken> and the internet filter hasn't banned BronyState for reasons I still don't understand
<MirrorImage> that only depends on how vivid your imagination is arrowtobroknee
<arrowtobroknee> very
<bugeyes8> Screw black ops and lets get back to pastel ponies!
*Dashie_Dashie reads my little dashie not thinking i'd shed one tear.
*Dashie_Dashie many many man tears were shed
<RawketLawnchair> My little dashie.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<RawketLawnchair> Umbasa. . .
<Yellowquiet> XD
<ScootaChicken> My Little Dashie is a really manipulative fanfic
<Gumri> Wait a second... THIS ISN'T LIVE!
<Ingwaz> bugeyes8: its not the violence in it, its the psychology of it
<prince-dari> Fanfics don't make me cry. :P
<bugeyes8> I know, it just didn't get to me anything like MLD
*Ingwaz is a cryer
<Tovler> I guess I'm supposed to be offended and horrified by "baked goods" in order to be a brony.
<Dashie_Dashie> wait are we talking about the fic that shall not be named?
<Dashie_Dashie> because that gave me mental scaring .__.
<prince-dari> No, we're not.
<Gumri> Anything makes me cry and i always make myself look like an idiot :D
<Fleur> prince-dari made me cry once
<Yellowquiet> my little dashie
<bugeyes8> I don't cry at anything, but i cried like a man at my little dashie
<Yellowquiet> not that other horrible thing
<prince-dari> Why, did all the wub get to your head? :P
<Radu> Dad exits house, flash crashes. Seems legit.
<Ingwaz> wub wub wub
<Fleur> MLD is nothing
<Gumri> lol Radu
<Radu> Really, Fleur?:O
<Randomnerd> That was written by someone overcompensating for liking ponies.
<arrowtobroknee> My Little dashie is beautiful and it made me cry
<Radu> Share more c:
<Gumri> I do believe my d key is about to fall of :|
<Randomnerd> The disliked fic, I mean.
<Ingwaz> lol trixie face
<Fleur> prince-dari you remember that zombie fic you did a live reading of? It had to do with a cough.
<prince-dari> Oh yeah.
<prince-dari> That one.
<Ingwaz> no Randomnerd, it was written as a prank on someone actually
<valoreins> I just read my litttle dashie minutes ago...
<Gumri> oh the cough god damn
<RawketLawnchair> You have a Trixie under your D key there, Gumri ?
<Randomnerd> lol really?
<Ingwaz> indeed
<Starflash> valoreins cool :O

<Ingwaz> well everypony, i must be going now, my planet needs me
<Radu> Fact: Rainbow Dash is hiding under your S key. Lesson? Never press the S key again!

<Randomnerd> See ya, Ingwaz
<bugeyes8> NEVER AGAIN
<Fleur> I am /so/ glad you stopped reading the fic that followed it before anything happened though. Thank you for that prince-dari. ^_^
<RawketLawnchair> Ingwaz died on the way back to his home planet.
<Ingwaz> RD hiding under your keys? rip the key off!
<prince-dari> Eugh, wish I'd stopped reading Skittles.
<ScootaChicken> Skittles?
<bugeyes8> The only fic i ever finished besides MLD and It was fallout equesatria
<Radu> Don't you eat Skittles?
<prince-dari> You don't want to know.
<ScootaChicken> I've heard people mention that before
<Ingwaz> prince-dari: what fic were you reading? the unmentionable?
<ScootaChicken> but I have no idea what it is
<arrowtobroknee> Never heard of the skittles fic.
<ScootaChicken> Ingwaz, he was reading the Cough I think
<Gumri> RD is under my keys and that is why about half of them are now gone :D
<ScootaChicken> I wasn't there though
