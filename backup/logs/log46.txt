<Metal_Link> Close curtains, thwart snipers.
<Elky> I like movies late at night
<SirSprinkles> 6Eyup.

<CAJ> Twilight broke... DA RULES.
<Ghosties> You didn't miss much, honestly
<SirSprinkles> 6It's... so bad.
<Hipster_Brony> 8Espy: that scene in Fantasia scared the hell out of me when i was a kid
<CAJ> and messed up an entire day's worth of work.
<Darf14> This is what you get for using magic
<Tyranico> Irony...
<Elky> brozilla: what's that 'ass' you speak of?
<DragonRage> Things start going a little wrong, Twilight panics instead of keeping her cool.

<EspyLacopa> More importantly, she used magic poorly.
<CAJ> besides, Twilight only cried because she tried everything and messed up at it.
<Novakhast> I feel sooo bad for her
<NewManiac> Thhat "Oh," at the end gave me Diabetes.

<SirSprinkles> 6Realistically you kinda have to stare at the flooding most of the time anyway...
<TGPFluttershy> D'awwwww...
<ValtheJean> Don't use yer fancy magic to mudder the issue!
<Metal_Link> Spike should stop talking bushes.
<DashAttack> it's okay Twilight, you suck at practical stuff, but you're still adorkable
<Elky> because you wouldn'T be angry if someone ruined all your day's work...
<Hipster_Brony> 8RainBroDash: I know that feel bro
<EspyLacopa> RainBroDash: The advancing coffin from Fantasia.
<Ghosties> To be honest, I'm not even really watching WWU right now

<ValtheJean> and then they hatched a new Spike, and nopony could tell the difference
<Fengor> actually SirSprinkles this is what Faust said about Ditzy Doo "Lauren Faust has acknowledged the fan following of Derpy. She revealed that, in one of then unaired episodes at the time, Winter Wrap Up, there is a mention of an airheaded pegasus called Ditzy Doo whose appearance is never established on-screen, and should Ditzy make an appearance Faust may--

<EspyLacopa> Sultana wants the Stalker.
<Ghosties> 4You know, I gotta admit, Deathstalker's kind of a likeable protagonist...
<NewManiac> 90% of her line are "STALKER!"
<Darf14> dam broad, she could have ended the movie early

<DashAttack> "you was dead"
<Hipster_Brony> 8HUH?!
<NewManiac> Ghosties, he's a sexist who only says one-liners!
<DashAttack> good grammar is good
<TurniBrony> >TVtropes
<DragonRage> Not really surprising that he'd be likable in that case.
<TurniBrony> Nope.avi

<SraKe> da da da da!
<Elky> but she's a woman!
<Nittany_Tiger> EAWWWWW

<Elky> she can't possibly be useful

<Barry> What year was this made?
<WinstonChurchill> win arrows
<dance1212> so 1.05 against 1
<DarkenedPath> girls? girls can't fight...
<SilverMane> that's how they say it
<SraKe> Suddnely more peole
<Fengor> 1987
<dance1212> thats uneven
<Barry> ah
<ValtheJean> this needs more pie weapons
<DashAttack> LESBIAN TRIBE RAPE SOUND
<Darf14> Quick, cast 2 lightning!
<DragonRage> HAY!
<DashAttack> ARROW RAPE SOUND!
<Hipster_Brony> since we're doing the wicker man on halloween, im changing my picks
<dance1212> MAGIC
<Nittany_Tiger> Feminists!
<SilverMane> you know, the enemy is all melee, so just arrow-kill them
<kir13> epic music for epic battle
<prince-dari> Friendship! Friendship everywhere!
<Nittany_Tiger> Lol
<RenegadeBrony> 0Damned if I don't have a headache for the ages right now... glad I turned my speakers down.
<DashAttack> rape sound for everything!
<Hipster_Brony> im gonna do black dynamite if i get the b movie and no country for old men if i get the A movie
<SilverMane> DAT FRIENDSHIP
<Aponymous> 0Charging into battle wearing bikinis? Smart, very smart.
<Ghosties> And I can't ask for Vampire's Kiss if I get b movie
<NewManiac> How did they get so many people to "act" in this movie?
<Darf14> Hes a wizard so he has a magical advantace
<Barry> prince-dari: not likely
<RainBroDash> 10mine are Die Welle for A movie, and Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus for B movie
<kir13> free cupcakes newmaniac
<dance1212> epic fighting with props
<Aponymous> 0What happened there?
<SilverMane> i love the credits page, where they have about 100 names that are too small to read, on top of the entire army of people
<SirSprinkles> 6It's bikini mail
<NewManiac> kir13, fair trade.
<Hipster_Brony> 8dari, that better not be a wordfilter :D
<SirSprinkles> 6It gives epic AC
<RenegadeBrony> 0My guess, newmaniac, is that the actors in this movie have no self respect and mightn't ever will.
<prince-dari> Look at his swrod giving the guy a hug.
<Razyn> The best Overworld Themes can also serve as battle themes.
<Ghosties> So, I'll probably do Who Framed Roger Rabbit? for A movie or What Dreams May Come for A movie
<Fengor> if you pay attention you'll notice this is the same set from the beginning of the film just redressed
<prince-dari> sword*
<Ghosties> I don't have a B movie yet
<DashAttack> i killed someone! oopsie!

<EspyLacopa> Multicolored houses are the best houses.
<SirSprinkles> 6We WILL
<Elky> 400 babies!
<Ignaesia> this montage is tear inducing
<Tacowiz> I WANT TO HAVE THIS MUCH SEX
<Rider> Incoming dark turn
<DragonRage> Entire sky is babies!
<SraKe> I gets sad Now...
<Bjornfot> DAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
<CAJ> YOU'LL HAVE SO MANY BABIES
<DarkenedPath> entire team is babies!
<charmin> babies, babies everywhere
<prince-dari> Did she died?
<Ghosties> 4NO babies :(
<Hipster_Brony> godfather: strong and graphic violence and some sexual content
<DashAttack> BABIES ARE KENYANS
<RainBroDash> 10SHUSH AND ENJOY IT DARI
<Toty> sterile lol
<TwilightFan> .....
<RainBroDash> 10>:3
<charmin> nope
<SraKe> No shes sterile
<Darf14> no baby, CAD Reference?
<SraKe> Maybe
<CAJ> So can she not have babies, or did she miscarry?
<Elky> you should be condemned toty
<CAJ> I assume the former.
<Ghosties> 4Why didn't they ever just adopt?
<TwilightFan> I missed it didn't I?
<SraKe> Either one
<Tacowiz> Word of God says she miscarried.
<EspyLacopa> It's never mentioned. Just, no babies.
<HaveTubeWillTravel> I was just thinking the EXACT SAME THING, Ghosties :D
<TwilightFan> Well fuck. -.-
<CAJ> That's... a good point, Ghosties.
<HaveTubeWillTravel> Maybe the law about that sort of thing was different back then
<themarewhoarrangestheblocks> thats an expenisve whell
<WinstonChurchill> Insurance maybe?
<Tacowiz> Well, Word of God technically said "lost her baby"
<Elky> it wouldn't be the same thing
<Hipster_Brony> battlefield earth: some violence
<Darf14> That is a good point
<Tacowiz> I assumed that meant miscarriage.
<EspyLacopa> Dang you tree!
<Ghosties> 4Adopting was different laws for a white couple?
<Ghosties> 4Seriously?
<Tacowiz> Does lost her baby=miscarriage?
<RainBroDash> 10suddenly, square chin/
<Ghosties> 4No offense, honestly
<Ghosties> 4But I'm just saying
<CAJ> Maybe they didn't want to "replace" her child who died?
<Darf14> Bow ties are cool
<Elky> I love this chin
<SraKe> Soo cute
<Purple`Prose> Incoming really damn dark turn
<Kaezone> oh fu...I just got here
<Tacowiz> A balloon salesman his entire life? Really?
<TwilightFan> How much of this did I miss exactly?
<HaveTubeWillTravel> CAJ probably has the right idea, but it's still a little odd
<Nittany_Tiger> It pays good I bet.
<Nittany_Tiger> :p
<EspyLacopa> Tacowiz: He is an epic balloon salesman.
<SraKe> I gets sad again now
<Ghosties> 4If their child did die
<prince-dari> Now did she died?
<EspyLacopa> Sells balloons to anyone, anytime, anyplace.
<Ghosties> 4We don't know if she's sterile or just miscarried
<CAJ> Up 2: Carl totally adopts Russel.
<Hipster_Brony> link when its up so i can watch it
<Purple`Prose> ...
<Kaezone> ffffuuuu :(
<Tacowiz> Ellie was a Jehovah's witness. She refused to get a blood transfusion. Thus, she died.
<Ignaesia> tears :(
<Purple`Prose> I've got something in my eye... I got something in my other eye...
<Darf14> now its getting depressing....:(
<Bjornfot> Up 2: Carl dies
<RainBroDash> 10lol tacowiz

<TwilightFan> 0They can ALL talk? I thought it was only Dug. O.O
<Metal_Link> It's a talking dog!
<Rider> Only Dug can make the word prisoner sound adorable
<Purple`Prose> Nicest, captor, ever
<Rellek> Samuel
<Polarfire> BUT ITS A TALKING DOOOOOG!
<Darf14> Yes dog, you can be my pris- er....I mean companion....yes.
<DragonRage> Mayhaps you desire SQUIRREL!
<charmin> lol
<Hipster_Brony> 8SQUIRREL!
<summerstorm> alpha is a good looking dog lol
<Rellek> IZMA! Ugly
<Nittany_Tiger> More talking dogs!
<Bjornfot> >mfw worms voice
<Polarfire> Alpha voice
<EspyLacopa> It's a small mailman!
<Ziltoid> is alpha a pinsher?
<Soarin> dat voice
<Purple`Prose> Someone's been sucking on the helium
<DashAttack> why am i suddenly reminded of Zim?
<mysterypony> who send talking dogs to fight?
<Darf14> If that's alpha, what ever happen to beta and omega?
<Ghosties> I wouldn't mind putting up a partnership, but I'd still like to know their plans
<Metal_Link> SQUIRREL
<Darf14> Oh that answers my question
<EspyLacopa> Someone is begging for the cone of shame.
<CAJ> FORESHADOWING
<DragonRage> Russel is best small mailman.
<TheKataklyst> Alpha is Fomay the Squirrel?
<summerstorm> lol at small mailman
<Purple`Prose> That is a BUILT damn dog
<mysterypony> who send little dog to fight me
<HaveTubeWillTravel> Alpha is the best part of this movie
<summerstorm> omg alpha is toatally foamy
<NewManiac> Darf14, beta comes after alpha and omega is much later in the Greek alphabet. The third one would gamma.
<mysterypony> $100
<charmin> epsilon
<charmin> delta
<Purple`Prose> Small mailman XD
<Rellek> i thought the third one was gamma
<Nittany_Tiger> Why am I reminded of the 2006 hurricane season.
<Bane> Hello
<Nittany_Tiger> ?
<summerstorm> BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL BALL
<Darf14> @NewManiac oops I completely forgot about gamma
<NewManiac> Rellek, it is. That's what I said.
<Purple`Prose> uh oh..
<Ray> 02Hi Jet~
<charmin> hi bane
<TwilightFan> 0DashAttack: Who's reminding you of Zim?
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, it's not like it would much matter.
<Rellek> then where'd the omega come from?
<SraKe> I think Doug is Delta
<summerstorm> HAI THERE
<EspyLacopa> A ball!
<DragonRage> Hi master.
*Nittany_Tiger is reminded of 2 Stupid Dogs.
<mysterypony> oh hi master
<DashAttack> Alpha giving commands in that high pitched voice
<HaveTubeWillTravel> I think Doug wasn't important enough to get a Greek letter
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm sure they'd take suggestions on things if we gave them. *shrug*
<Elky> the bees!
<TheKataklyst> All Dogs Go To Heaven!
<SirSprinkles> 6And it's really just plugging eachother.
<Rider> Not the BEES!
<JetTheLatios> Hey Ray D:
<mysterypony> all over my I's
<HaveTubeWillTravel> It's been a while since I've seen Up, but I remember [spolier] having more dogs than there are Greek letters
<DashAttack> just the way he was talking XD
<charmin> all dogs go to heaven!!!!!!!!!
<JetTheLatios> Its dead silent ._.
<DragonRage> Movie froze on me for a second.
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Purple`Prose> >___>
<SraKe> Ouch
<Aponymous> 0Ouch
<EspyLacopa> Hi master.
<Darf14> U MAD OLD MAN?
<Ray> 02Yeah ._.
<SirSprinkles> 6HaveTuba, he doesn't call them all by greek letter though
<DragonRage> Tentfail.
<Purple`Prose> <Dug> *trollface*
<HaveTubeWillTravel> Ah, right
<DashAttack> GPM's
<SirSprinkles> 6i.e. Gray leader, gray one, and gray two.
<summerstorm> GPM LOL
<NewManiac> I don't know the whole Greek alphabet. Most of what I know comes from Snic Adventure.
<charmin> more blood???
<HaveTubeWillTravel> Remember now.
<NewManiac> Sonic*
<charmin> ah no
<charmin> that was the shadow
<Ghosties> In that case, that's fine. I don't know if it's possible to have partnerships through steam, but I'll promote them in stuff in the group
<Hipster_Brony> they have 3 people in their group, so its more like we would be absorbing them
<Polarfire> lol
<charmin> in russels face
<JetTheLatios> I hate today, nobody is online D:<
<Purple`Prose> tentapult
<Ghosties> Also
<Darf14> I learn it from Sonic Adventure as well, it was fun for its time period
<Rider> The safest place to be. Under a house suspended in air.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, but they may get people down the line.
<SirSprinkles> 6Since it'll be a gaming clan, of sorts.
<Purple`Prose> Cue Dorothy
<EspyLacopa> A house suspended by balloons.
<summerstorm> held up by ballons
<mysterypony> you not my fucking mother!
<DragonRage> Ah, Sonic Adventure.
<Rider> Helium baloons
<EspyLacopa> Balloons that have been stated are losing their lift.
<Ghosties> We're about 7 members away from "tieing" with FiM Theater Night
<DragonRage> E-102 Gamma is best protagonist.
<Purple`Prose> Again, Cue Dorothy
<SraKe> Psi
<summerstorm> lol
<Purple`Prose> ...owch
<SirSprinkles> 6Which has been on steam much longer.
<NewManiac> Sonic Adventure was back when Sonic was awesome.
<Darf14> Too bad they can't get up there and sleep in their house
<Ghosties> Well, they never have any kind of events
<SirSprinkles> 6We'll re-plug it after the stream.
<DashAttack> hope to fly
<Bane> myterypony hahahaha! :)
<SirSprinkles> 6No, they don't.
<summerstorm> sonic was awesome for the first 3 games after that crapp
<DashAttack> stick a cupcake in my eye
<Ignaesia> Sonic Colours is awesome though
<DragonRage> Stick a cupcake in my eye.
<Hipster_Brony> 8meanwhile, an amber alert goes out for russell
<CAJ> so is Russell's mom dead?
<Purple`Prose> Yes, it is
<EspyLacopa> Sonic did poorly in the transition to 3D.
<Purple`Prose> Yes, she is
<Ghosties> 4summerstorm: Well, that's, like, your opinion man
<charmin> eyup
<summerstorm> its a dreamworks movie so of course shes dead
<DragonRage> That poor frog.
<Ghosties> 4Sonic Adventure 1 and 2 were good titles
<Fengor> i think the fact the bottom of the house hasn't fallen out in the absence of a foundation speaks wonders for it's quality of construction
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<DragonRage> Pixar, not Dreamworks.
<Purple`Prose> ...WRONG STUDIOU SUMMERSTORM
<HyperMetalLugia> Nobody wants to talk today
<Hipster_Brony> 8lol fengor
<Darf14> I concur with Ghosties
<Bane> MY GOD
<mysterypony> I like the genesis sonic
<summerstorm> oops sorry
<Rellek> lmao
<Aponymous> 0Sonic Colors was awesome.
<Bane> Ghosties, I love you
<NewManiac> And then Sonic '06 came along.
<charmin> lol summer storm
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> inb4 Frog
<DragonRage> Point!
<Darf14> Ahh the glitch fest of 06
<Ghosties> 4o.o Bane
<DashAttack> Sonic Adventure 2 was good minus the Knuckles/Rogue, and Eggman/Tails segments
<mobileDCD> guys, sorry I kind of shut up, but was walking
<Bane> Ghosties you saw The big Lebowski?
<NewManiac> Don't forget the bestiality.
<mobileDCD> allow me to elaborate on them ideas
<Ignaesia> Sonic Colours redeemed 06
<Rider> 1/3 of Sonic Adventure 2 was good
<Ghosties> 4Sooooo...DashAttack only liked Sonic
<DragonRage> I liked the Eggman/Tails segments.
<DashAttack> and Shadow
<DragonRage> They reminded me of Gamma. =/
<Ghosties> 4No, I haven't, Bane
<Purple`Prose> Point!
<mobileDCD> the first one would obviously be "expansion"
<Rider> Stealth Pun
<Soarin> get off of his wroof
<Bane> ....oh.
<Rellek> XD
<DashAttack> it's just that they were tedious is all
<RainBroDash> 10SA2 was great, gonna put my foot down :P
<Bane> D:
<Hipster_Brony> 8DAT GUILT TRIP
<NewManiac> Bane, I've seen the Big Lebowski. My science teacher recommended it to me.
<mysterypony> woof
<mobileDCD> for that, we need to get a number of small partners before plugging for the big ones
<DashAttack> when, you know, i'd rather be rolling at the speed of sound
<CAJ> *brohoofs RainBroDash*
<Rellek> lol guilt trip
<RainBroDash> 10(back btw, sorry to interrupt dcd)
<Rellek> Izam trip
<Ignaesia> I wish they would bring back Chao Garden
<HaveTubeWillTravel> "Everybody up" That's a subtle title drop there
<Aponymous> 0The Adventure series was awesome.
<Purple`Prose> Carl doesn't give a damn
<Ghosties> "big ones?"
<mobileDCD> I'm gunning for us to achieve partnership status with the main FiM Steam Group
<charmin> chao garden?
<Bane> My god those effing chaos
<Purple`Prose> I have to admit, I admire his dedication
<RainBroDash> 10Ignaesia <3 damn straight. CAJ you know it dude *brohoof*
<mobileDCD> which has, y'know, 8000 members
<charmin> that was kinda boring
<Ghosties> You mean partners with My Little Pony
<Ghosties> Gotcha
<NewManiac> RainBro, the music in the Knuckles segments were terrible.
<Darf14> Oh I remember those chao, they were fun to toss and abuse >=)
<SraKe> Alpha Beta Gamma Delta Epsilon Zeta Eta Theta Iota Kappa Lambda Mun Nu Xi Omicron Pi Rho Sigma Tau Upsilon Phi Chi Psi Omega
<EspyLacopa> It least it doesn't have sonic-wolf.
<Fengor> the Knuckles segments were just terrible period
<DragonRage> Oh gods, Pumpkin Hill.
<NewManiac> Let us not forget "I can sense it in my feet."
<RainBroDash> 10NewManiac but it was COMPLETELY outdone by the shadow music. that was SICK and you know it
<Ghosties> 4All I know is: Sonic Generations
<Rider> Chao's are stupid. Everytime I hatched one, it tried to drown itself in the pond.
<Aponymous> 0Knuckles stage music was hilarious.
<Elky> testin'
<Rellek> SraKe *claps*
<RainBroDash> 10I CAN SENSE IT IN MY FEET THE GREAT EMERALD'S POWER ALLOWS ME TO FEEL
<RainBroDash> 10I CAN'T SEE A THING BUT IT'S AROUND SOMEWHERE
<DashAttack> the only good thing about Knuckles' stages was the music
<DashAttack> because it was terrible
<RainBroDash> 10haters hatin yet?
<Hipster_Brony> 8this is why sonic is awesome: http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110702145402/gyropedia/images/d/d2/Doctum_Face.png
<mysterypony> 1,2,3, and sonic and knuckles for me
<CAJ> I AM THE FIGHTING FREE KNUCKLES
<RainBroDash> 10lmao hipster calssic
<TwilightFan> 0Rider: It hated you maybe? :P
<charmin> hahaha
<CAJ> AND I'M AT PUMPKIN HILL
<CAJ> YOU READY>!
<Purple`Prose> PUPPIES!!!
<Ignaesia> I have 4 words to say about the Shadow game: FIND THE COMPUTER ROOM
<Fengor> oh god is that one of Chris Chan's abominations?
<Ghosties> 4I'm the only person happy about Sonic Generations? What's this world coming too...
<summerstorm> dem cheekbones
<mobileDCD> now for that, our greatest ace beneath the sleeve would be the fact that, y'know, we will stream the S2 eps live
<Darf14> I prefer the first 4 sonic games on genesis, and yes I am including sonic and nuckles
<RainBroDash> 10I AIN'T GONNA LET IT GET TO ME CAJ
<DashAttack> i kinda want it Ghosties, but i'm skeptical
<mysterypony> I sometime like the 3D one
<TwilightFan> 0Why do some of you have colors?
<Aponymous> 0Sonic Generations looks great.
<NewManiac> Ghosties, I've yet to play it.
<mysterypony> but not really
<Purple`Prose> The puppies are not amused
<DashAttack> though, i really loved Sonic 4 on XBLA
<Ghosties> 4I can understand skeptical
<RainBroDash> 10I must stop this lyricspam though
<Darf14> Land of the evil dogs
<SraKe> Theyre mods TwilighFan
<Ignaesia> TwilightFan because Sonic Colous was surprisingly awesome
<Ghosties> 4But When I saw Classic Sonic and a remade Green Hill Zone? And the music?
<TwilightFan> 0Ah.
<Ghosties> 4Amazing
<mysterypony> >thinking that sonic went downhill after sonic 06
<EspyLacopa> Oh hi Muntz.
<Purple`Prose> Muntz is what happens when Twilight and Pinkie's child got old and angry
<Ignaesia> oh you mean text nvm
<TwilightFan> 0Ignaesia: Not what I meant. LOL
<Bjornfot> DARNDEST THING
<Hipster_Brony> 8Fengor: it's the Doctum face
<NewManiac> The theme to Sonic Heroes is catchy as fuck.
<Ignaesia> hahaha
<RainBroDash> 10RBD has Fish n Chips *hoping that I get some love from my Brit buddies <3*
<DragonRage> I like you temporarily!
<TwilightFan> 0Hmm.....
<DragonRage> Dogs.
<Darf14> We came all this way for sugar and you are going to give it to us
<Bane> hahahaha
<HaveTubeWillTravel> *gives love to RBD*
<TwilightFan> 0Yep.
<mobileDCD> so once we get the Partner System rolling we should aim to get our episode streamers to finally contact said group
<SraKe> TwilightFan Mods=Colors
<Ignaesia> <3 Haddock and Chips :D << British brony
<HaveTubeWillTravel> Fish n chips are proof that god loves us
<TwilightFan> 0I see......
<Bjornfot> I'm not too big on fish rainbrodash, but it's better that american fatty crap.
<RainBroDash> 10FFFFFUUUUUUUU I FORGOT MY CHIP FORKS
<Aponymous> 0The Small Mailman smells like chocolate!
<Purple`Prose> Me and Rider have muffins

<Bjornfot> WAT
<Purple`Prose> Muuuuufffiiiiiiins
<Darky> 06Gnite all :3
<Elky> I love how different their faces are
<Darf14> Be...our Guest be our Guest.
<Bjornfot> YOU EAT CHIPS WITH A FORK?
<Elky> there are some things you can't jsut do in live action
<NewManiac> Also, SOnicSATAM was bad-ass.
<mysterypony> Sonic puzzle fighter
<HaveTubeWillTravel> Yes, Bjorn. Brits are classy that way
<mobileDCD> but our first objective should be a bit less ambitious: let's try breaking into the Ponychan Pwn Party in Steam
<Bjornfot> You eat freakin chips with your hands.
<Purple`Prose> Amen NewManiac
<EspyLacopa> Go dirigible go.
<Darf14> I am going to take this chip and EAT IT!
<Purple`Prose> SatAM was epic
<RainBroDash> 10Bjornfot you must live in one of those ridiculous countries. let me show you:
<Purple`Prose> CONE OF SHAME
<Ignaesia> Cone of shame lol
<RainBroDash> 10http://www.bluejigsaw.co.uk/xphotos/12328/1.jpg
<DashAttack> Darf14: lulz, dramatic potato chip
<RainBroDash> 10Chip forks.
<NewManiac> I'm not even going to correct my accidentally capitalizing two letters anymore.
<mysterypony> sonic underwater racing
<Fengor> those are sporks dude
<Bjornfot> I live in Sweden, so yeah RainBroDash, very ridiculous-
<DragonRage> Dogs are terrible at pouring wine.
<Elky> that doesn't look classy at all
<Ghosties> DCD, you think like a business man
<NewManiac> Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog was complete shit, though.
<RainBroDash> 10yes, ridiculous country without wooden chip forks. Every single fish n chip shop has them
<HaveTubeWillTravel> It doesn't look classy but it is, if you hold the fork right
<mysterypony> I like Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog my good sir
<Bjornfot> >implying we have fish n chip shops
<Elky> we have those forks too, just noone uses them
<Purple`Prose> Muntz is such a badass
<SirSprinkles> 6BMN is srs bsns
<RainBroDash> 10also, you try to eat everything else with the chip fork; so you eat fish with a chip fork, sausages with a chip fork, whatever you bought with your chips
<Fengor> really? cause they gave me normal plastic forks when I got some fish and chips while in London
<charmin> epsilon
<Purple`Prose> Muntz is so badass that Celestia decided to just leave him alone in the Everfree.
<JetTheLatios> I do, but nobody listens >.>
<Elky> what the
<RainBroDash> 10Fengor london is shit
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Fengor, that is the HEIGHT of class.
<Darf14> He is more evil with that voive
<Rider> Starring Doctor Claw as Alpha
<mysterypony> super sonic eating challenge
<RainBroDash> 10plastic forks are bleugh
<Darf14> i mean voice....*sigh*

<mobileDCD> Funny, cause I'm a future doctor.

<Fengor> ah and now the full depth of his crazy is revealed
<Darf14> Treat? Where!

<DragonRage> Chocolate is delicious.
<Purple`Prose> Pinkie Muntz is full of rage
<Bane> Reese's puffs is my cereal of choice
<Darf14> So, he was hunting for that bird for over 100 years, and a different old man that wasn't even trying found it in 15 minutes. FAIL!
<Purple`Prose> or is it Muntzy Pie?
<Fengor> sometimes Pixar needs to let off some grimdark after making movies like Wall-E and Cars
<RainBroDash> 10>mfw I just fabricated a chip fork out of a magnum ice cream stick *fucking macgyver in this hizzle*
<Ghosties> 4Serial killer? IN MY PIXAR?

<charmin> musafa fall to his death and hes not a villain
<Purple`Prose> QUICKTIME EVENT GO
<NewManiac> Bane I have never noticed and it is completely fucking true.
<DragonRage> You're good, Carl, but I'm better!
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just to keep from constant turbochat.
<Aponymous> 0Apparently Pixar REALLY wanted to avoid a falling death but felt they had no choice.
<RainBroDash> 10hm
<Bjornfot> i don't understand how this guy is "evil"... he just wants to prove himself. for science
<DragonRage> He's evil because he's a murderer.
<SraKe> Hes like Glados
<Darf14> Gun's are very rare to appear on a animated film.
<EspyLacopa> Considering the setting of the movie, falling to death really isn't that out of place.
<Purple`Prose> and a lunatic
<Bane> He tried to send a kid plummeting to the earth
<Ghosties> That's why we'd be splitting the channel into different rooms, so a couple mods can be in one room
<NewManiac> He has an old guy and a kid at gunpoint.
<Ignaesia> why are level action and bolt action guns so manly?
*Ray yawns and takes a nap on Jet's head
<Fengor> he evil because he's trying to kill the protagonists
<Bane> and chop an old man in half
<Ghosties> And keep from horrid turbo chat
<mobileDCD> now that's why making them themed is a good idea. We will probably not have full rooms, as most people will flock to their favorite pony rooms
<DragonRage> You're in my sights! You're going down!
<Bane> yup
<thetrollside> HA
*JetTheLatios flies while Ray is on head.
<DragonRage> What the heck?
<JetTheLatios> owo
<mysterypony> fuuuuuuuuuu
<EspyLacopa> Curse you balloons@!
<Ghosties> How many rooms are we talking?
<DragonRage> I... can't... looooooooose!
<Bane> needed more balloon
<Hipster_Brony> 8KILLING YOUR CHILDHOOD IDOL LIKE A BOSS
<SraKe> Those Balloons will save him
<Ghosties> 4Did he died?
<TwilightFan> 0Bye bye bad guy.
<SirSprinkles> 6Six? :D
<Purple`Prose> Adventure awaits you... ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET DOWN
<mobileDCD> we can also react accordingly. For example, we can expect the Rainbow Dash room to hit more traffic.
<Rider> Don't worry. He was still tied to some balloons.
<EspyLacopa> Remember what he had a daydream about earlier in the movie?
<mysterypony> KILL MY IDOL
<Fengor> CURSE YOU PERRY THE PLATYPUS!!
<mysterypony> LIKE A BOSS
<RainBroDash> 10I just realised Kevin makes the same noise as those little dinosaurs in Jurassic Park
<RainBroDash> 10...
<DragonRage> It all comes full circle, Espy.
<Darf14> What a horrible way to go, this is why you always carry a leaf to turn into a racoon.
<mobileDCD> Furthermore! There is also another vital part of my plan!
<SraKe> NOOOOOO ELLIE!
<charmin> bye bye house
<Elky> they're pretty cheerful, considering they just killed a guy
<Bajar> he survives, lands in equestria
<NewManiac> Purple'Prose: YEEAAAAAAAAH!
<Ghosties> *gasp* :O
<SirSprinkles> 6Six mane mods, six mane ponies, six rooms.
<Purple`Prose> GET A SWEET BLIMP! LIKE A BOSS!
<Rocker32703> Yeeeaaah
<EspyLacopa> Where upon they love and tolerate the shit out of the old crazy guy.
<mysterypony> fly into the sun!
<mobileDCD> OBJECTION!
<CAJ> And thus, Carl kept his promise to deliver the house in a blimp.
<mysterypony> like a boss
<Bjornfot> :V
<thetrollside> i like to thin we'll all go to equestria when we die :S
<mobileDCD> I'm not talking about six rooms to start with...
<thetrollside> think*
<Ignaesia> We will dont worry
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, we /could/
<RainBroDash> 10>kill old guy >steal his shit >open the door >get on the floor >everybody walk the dinosaur
<mobileDCD> ...I'm talking about seven.
<DashAttack> ROFL
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL WUT?
<Hipster_Brony> also, i think the plan was 2 main mane mods per room
<Bane> I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN EQUESTRIA
<EspyLacopa> lol
<mobileDCD> *Cue Objection!2004.mp3*
<Fengor> lol RainBroDash
<Hipster_Brony> mane*
<NewManiac> RainBroDash, you win comedy.
<Ghosties> Seven?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Thirded
<Rellek> lol
<Ghosties> Wut?
<Purple`Prose> And the Great Fox takes off
<mysterypony> ha
<Darf14> That cane has a lot of iron on it, that's why they want to eat it
<DragonRage> Fourthed.
<Elky> disregard house, acquire airship
*Hipster_Brony 8brohoofs RainBroDash
<Ignaesia> Ill come trotting the rolling hills with you
<Rocker32703> Fifthed.
<SraKe> Grand theft Derigible
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, Hipster, that would limit us greatly...
<WhatPayne> Seriously I want effin Zepelin!
*RainBroDash 10brohoofs
<mysterypony> he seen bored out of his mind
<Purple`Prose> Disregard grandbabies, ACQUIRE DOGGY MINIONS
<DragonRage> Wild Animal Defensive Arts.
<EspyLacopa> Wow, he's so excited about handing out badges.
<Rider> Star Fox. We are forever in your debt
<SirSprinkles> 6And we'd obviously be watching eachother's rooms a bit anyway.
<Sathi> awww
<Elky> zeppelins are fraking impractical
<Purple`Prose> manly tears T__T
<mysterypony> and this go's to *yarn*
<charmin> for being an epic hero...
<SirSprinkles> 6Poking our heads in and whatnot.
<Fengor> I present you this Medal of Honor
<Hipster_Brony> also
<charmin> a shitty plastic medal
<Rellek> Waaaaht?
<RainBroDash> 10it makes me sadface splitting mods into seperate rooms
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> inb4 Woah
<NewManiac> "You have saved me from the ninjas, dudes! Want to go get a burger?
<Hipster_Brony> this is a minor thing
<Bjornfot> CALL OF DUTY OLOLOLOLOLOL
<NewManiac> "
<Hipster_Brony> but
<Bane> Elky, It's a giant balloon house... in the SKY.
<mysterypony> woah
<Soarin> daaaaaaw
<RainBroDash> 10just saiyan, i see it's necessary
<Darf14> A bottle cap, *salutes*
<EspyLacopa> D'awww
<Rider> Apparantly he never washed up between now and leaving
<Elky> then just us a normal balloon
<Hipster_Brony> we should have a pic of Celestia that links to the mod room
<mobileDCD> yes. One room with no limits, mostly unmoderated because said conditions would not allow for effective moderation. However, the existence of said conditions would also make it so that moderation isn't so vital.
<Aponymous> 0SO MUCH DOG
<Rocker32703> Gray one
<Hipster_Brony> you would have to type in a password and such still
<EspyLacopa> Caw caw, RAWR!
<Fengor> and not a fuck was given by his mom that day
<mysterypony> red one
<mysterypony> BLUE
<mobileDCD> ...Anything Goes Chat Room! Derpy Hooves! *finger point*
<Bane> I have a feeling Dug will win
<DragonRage> Dug is best talking dog.
<Ghosties> A room with no limits?
<Rocker32703> Gray?
<Ghosties> No moderation?
<Elky> a compromise between steering and floating ability doesn't work
<Ghosties> You're joking
<SirSprinkles> 6The room for if your banned should be LUNA
<RainBroDash> 10an anything goes chat? :S
<Hipster_Brony> hmmmm
<EspyLacopa> And lo, they travel the world in the Spirit of Adventure.
<Purple`Prose> Your son is friends with a guy who has a badass airship
<Ghosties> Everyone would go there
<Hipster_Brony> i dunno about that
<Bane> Roses are gray, Violets are gray
<Purple`Prose> ... T____T
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> THE END
<Darf14> Screw your Car I have a Blimp, U JELLY?
<SirSprinkles> 6That's not a good idea...
<RainBroDash> 10it would be like a /b/ room
<Rider> Ow. My heart.
<Elky> that house crushed all his furniture
<DashAttack> then they fucked
<SirSprinkles> 6It would be SO bad.
<DragonRage> My son will never be friends with a guy who has a badass airship.
<SraKe> FRENCH!
<mobileDCD> consider the following scenario
<DragonRage> =/
<mysterypony> how?
<Hipster_Brony> that seems like it could backfire horribly
<RainBroDash> 10sorry to kinda shoot it down, but bah D:
<Ghosties> Everyone would go there, DCD
<WhatPayne> That's no blimp...
<Pattyrick|away> 0__o
<Aponymous> 0I want a dirigible. :(
<RainBroDash> 10Great film :)
<Fengor> this is where they need to show Muntz trudging through the jungle all like 'Next time Gadget, NEXT TIME!!!"
<Nittany_Tiger> Is this all in french?
<thetrollside> roses are gray, violets are gray, im dead and color blind
<Purple`Prose> And an army of talking dogs
<TheKataklyst> Happy ending!
<EspyLacopa> For a moment I was expecting the MLP:FIM ending song at this point.
<Ghosties> We wouldn't get any real viewers in the other rooms
<SirSprinkles> 6Everypony would go there...
<prince-dari> That ending...
<prince-dari> Wut?
<mobileDCD> Hold It!
<Elky> this movie needs more rape sounds
<DragonRage> Me too Espy, me too...
<Ghosties> No, sorry
<Darf14> oops I mean Zip-line.
<RainBroDash> 10dari just because there was no suicide
<Ghosties> No hold out
<Hipster_Brony> especially since by then we would have our own website with a domain name
<DragonRage> The two fit so well together.
<Rocker32703> Espy, same.
<Rider> God bless you John Lasseter
<Ghosties> That's just a bad idea
<DashAttack> i agree Elky
<charmin> copypasta song is boring
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> novaeu
<WhatPayne> That's a Zeppelin.
<Elky> but otherwise, it was good
<Pattyrick|away> I mean, hi everybody =D
<Soarin> needs more dramatic deathstalker sound
*JetTheLatios waves to Patty.
<Ghosties> What's the point of mods if there's a room with NO MODS
<mysterypony> roses are gray, violets are gray, i am dead and so are you *pull out gun*
<JetTheLatios> :>
<mobileDCD> what if one of the requirements for being in said room...is to be present in another one?
<SraKe> Star wars?
<TwilightFan> 0What's next guys?
<Bane> Needed more Rarity laugh
<Ghosties> Makes absolutely no sense
<EspyLacopa> Star Wars!
<Hipster_Brony> so if people were posting CP or something in there, we would be responsible for it
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> Starwars FTW!
<Purple`Prose> Stare Master
<Ghosties> Exactly
<Ghosties> Too risky
<Pattyrick|away> Hi Jet =D
<Ignaesia> Stare Master is next
<Ghosties> Sorry DCD
<Darf14> errgh, I even spelled it wrong, man I suck
<HaveTubaWillTravel> And then they saw Revenge of the Sith. The End
<SraKe> Og god!
<prince-dari> Needs more cyanide.
<Rocker32703> Suddenly dogs
<Pattyrick|away> How be you?
<Rocker32703> Thousands of them
<SirSprinkles> 6Way too risky.
<mobileDCD> now don't misunderstand me
<Ghosties> Too risky
<Ghosties> Bad idea
<Bjornfot> Dug scored big time.
<mobileDCD> I'm saying "mostly unmoderated" but not "without mods"
<EspyLacopa> Hey look, the kid got a new GPS.
<JetTheLatios> I to be good.
<Ghosties> No
<Purple`Prose> Carl lost his house, but got a surrogate son, a sweet airship, and an army of doggy minions
<Hipster_Brony> i would really rather not have an unmoderated room
<Ghosties> There's either "all" or "none"
<Purple`Prose> I think this counts as a net gain
<SirSprinkles> 6It would be too difficult to moderate that and a regular room.
<Hipster_Brony> "unmoderated"*
<Rocker32703> And another house.
<JetTheLatios> How to be are you? :o
<DashAttack> and his wife
<DragonRage> He also lived the dream.
<DashAttack> =/
<Nittany_Tiger> Now it's in English.
<Fengor> lets see Photo finish take his house now eh Purple'Prose?
<Ghosties> Let's just stick with the regular rooms and a mod room
<EspyLacopa> He also killed off his hero-turned-crazy-old-man
<Rellek> Ratzenburger
<Ghosties> Sound plan
<Darf14> That Zeppelin counts as his new house
<RainBroDash> 10But there's hardly anything to be moderated as it is, and where do you draw the line between 'fine for this room, not fine for the other'
<SirSprinkles> 6And the appeals room.
<Purple`Prose> XD
<mobileDCD> well, we have to consider the possible scenario of the other rooms becoming full
<SirSprinkles> 6Derpy can be the vid suggestion room.
<charmin> and he hit a man in the head with a cane
<EspyLacopa> Crazy dog man?
<TwilightFan> 0Trivia: John Ratzenberger is in EVERY FRIKKIN PIXAR MOVIE! :P
<mysterypony> pony time?
<Pattyrick|away> I
<SirSprinkles> 6We can raise the cap, DCD
<Ghosties> That's why we wouldn't allow an "unmoderated room" in the first place
<EspyLacopa> The alternative to the crazy cat lady?
<Pattyrick|away> 'm good
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not hard to do.
<Ghosties> That's way too much lee way
<SraKe> How much does it cost to fuel a zepplin?
<RainBroDash> 10DJ P0N-3 for suggestion room pony.
<Rellek> Twilightfan Yupperz
<mysterypony> give her time..
<Purple`Prose> It's an airship
<JetTheLatios> Ciao!
<JetTheLatios> :o
<Ghosties> Every room is moderated
<Fengor> nothing if you just let it float there
<RainBroDash> 10>:3
<Ignaesia> The Empire State Building was originally going to be a Zepplin port before we abandoned the technology, I saw it on Fringe
<Ghosties> Every room
<Purple`Prose> It runs on awesome
<Pattyrick|away> I'm talking with somebody on Skype, and I'm seeing if it's possible for me to use mIRC on my iPad
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (nickstr10) 11WB10»11•. 10- (3:17:02 PM) Yauncle[Eee]: welcome to the future, nickstr (3:17:18 PM) nickstr: sorry, I smoked a callender
<Darf14> and they say violence doesn't solve everything, this movie proves that those people are wrong
<Purple`Prose> It doesn't need to refuel
<Ghosties> And no "sorta kinda maybe" mod room
<EspyLacopa> Hmmm. An excellent point.
<NewManiac> TwilightFan and also has the most Jewish last name EVER!
<Ghosties> All rooms
<SraKe> WHat? No.... It has propellers
<Elky> heh, 'I saw it on fringe'
<nickstr> you can't
<nickstr> its only built for Windows
<SraKe> And eventually the Helium would run out!
<EspyLacopa> Lauren Tofal. . .for a second I thought that said Lauren Faust.
<charmin> it fuels with magic
<HaveTubaWillTravel> The ship in futurama is fueled by alien animal excrement. Maybe Muntz used the same principle centuries earlier
<SirSprinkles> 6Sorry DCD, it just... wouldn't work.
<Rocker32703> Espy, you and I both are way into this show. xD
<nickstr> you can use Colloquy for the iPad, iPod Touch, and iPhone though
<thetrollside> its magic i aint gotta explain shit
<SraKe> I runs on Dog shit
<Purple`Prose> This was a better Indiana Jones movie than the last Indiana Jones movie
<Pattyrick|away> they've made an app for it, though
<Pattyrick|away> let me see if it works, just installed
<Ghosties> It's three to one, sorry DCD
<nickstr> not the developer of mIRC
<HaveTubaWillTravel> SraKe said it far better than I ever could
<Purple`Prose> That makes a frightening amount of sense...
<SraKe> lol
<Elky> I never saw the fourth indiana jones movie
<Fengor> the last Indie movie sucked because of Shia LeButtz
<Rocker32703> prodUction
<Elky> was it okay?
<SirSprinkles> 6Four to one.
<nickstr> nope
<SirSprinkles> 6I think.
<Elky> hm
<DashAttack> and aliens, Fengor
<SirSprinkles> 6...
<EspyLacopa> Who's Shia LeButtz?
<NewManiac> Elky, there were aliens.
<Ghosties> Don't know where RBD stands
<nickstr> there is no such thing as an mIRC build for iOS devices
<Bajar> it was decent
<Ignaesia> No it wasn't
<Purple`Prose> Shia LeBouff
<RainBroDash> 10I'm a no
<EspyLacopa> Again, who?
<Sathi> Anypony seen Labyrynth?
<Elky> no nazis?
<Rider> Shia was the least of that movie's problems
<Hipster_Brony> i just cant imagine it ending well
<Ghosties> Four to one then
<Ignaesia> SOVIETS
<RainBroDash> 10:<
<Elky> then it must suck
<Fengor> I've seen Labrynth
<Darf14> I think it was o - *stabbed* URK!
<Ghosties> It wouldn't end well, it would cause a massive split and massive arguing amongst viewers
<NewManiac> Elky, Nazis and aliens.
<SirSprinkles> 6Even if the other mods all said yes, it would still be majority no.
<Elky> oh
<thetrollside> wtf does a radiation patch stand for O.o
<Fengor> it proves that any movie is improved by casting David Bowie as your villain
<Ghosties> We don't want OUR stream to become what Ponychan's like now
<Ignaesia> You mean commies and aliens
<Sathi> heheh
<SirSprinkles> 6Precisely.
<Purple`Prose> Sovienazis
<NewManiac> Possibly alien Nazis but I don't remember.
<TwilightFan> 0I only wanted to see THIS movie, so see ya.
<EspyLacopa> David Bowie as the villain, Bruce Campbell as the hero?
<Elky> anything is improved by david bowie
<mysterypony> take me back
<charmin> nazi commies
<mysterypony> IN TIIIIIME
<SraKe> Woah what?
<Hipster_Brony> and DCD is gone
<RainBroDash> 10Jewish Nazi Zombies?
<Elky> have you seen the prestige?
<SraKe> What is this Music?
<SirSprinkles> 6...LAWL
<Ghosties> I hope he's not upset
<Ghosties> But too bad
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I dunno the title, but I love it
<SirSprinkles> 6Hopefully not.
<Hipster_Brony> i dont think so
<HaveTubaWillTravel> This song is the cherry on top of a great movie
<Darken_Skye> I don't think I've ever heard this
<Sathi> and what about The Rocky Horror Picture Show
<Purple`Prose> Ziggy Stardust vs Ashley Williams
<RainBroDash> 10he probably lost 3G
<NewManiac> RainBro, >Jewish Nazis lolwut
<Hipster_Brony> he tends to drop in and out when hes on his blackberry
<Pattyrick|away> hmmm
<Rider> Directed by Sam Raimi
<SraKe> Sounds like a song from FallOut
<Darken_Skye> and I've seen this movie at least 4 times before this
<RainBroDash> 10NewManiac you wanna go?
<Darf14> sounds like Fallout / Bioshock music
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Darken: this is why I always stay for the credits in movie theatres, especially with Pixar movies ;)
<RainBroDash> 10Let's rumble >:3
<Fengor> Saw bits of the Rocky Horror on Bravo as a kid, was a bit of a mindfuck so I kinda want to see it now that I'm older
<Ghosties> Point is, there's just no way we can have a "mostly unmoderated" room. Waaaaaaay too much leniency and it would look bad on the mod staff
<Elky> I'm sure we'll have a Rocky Horror evening this summer
<Apokalipse> Yay guess I just came in for the end credits...
<Sathi> Sign me up for that ;)
<Ghosties> It would look unprofessional and we'd look weak
<Hipster_Brony> yeah
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> LIFE.
<SirSprinkles> 6So, mane six for rooms, Celestia is mod room, Luna is appeals room, Vinyl is suggestions, and Derpy is questions room?
<SraKe> Up the Video game
<thetrollside> FO:E chapter 29 made me sad face, poor twilight ;_;
<NewManiac> RainBro, no thank ypu.
<Hipster_Brony> and people would just spend the whole time there
<NewManiac> you*
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> THQ?
<RainBroDash> 10"<Elky>: I'm sure we'll have a Rocky Horror evening this summer" viewers suggesting viewers' suggestions
<Elky> either somebody will choose it, or they'll make a special show
<Ghosties> Exactly, "unmoderated room" would become the new /oat/
<RainBroDash> 10NewManiac :(
<Ghosties> Everyone would go there
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> FUUUUUU
<Sathi> oh yes please
<Purple`Prose> Someone needs to write Up/FiM fic
<DragonRage> I really need to man up and start reading FO:E.
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> WHEN IS THIS OVER
<HaveTubaWillTravel> FRENCH VOICES OUT OF NOWHERE
<Ghosties> It wouldn't be fair to the other rooms
<NewManiac> thetrollside, DON'T SPOIL IT! I'm only on chapter 4
<Hipster_Brony> i mean, if there were a board on ponychan where you could post ANYTHING and not get banned, would you go anywhere else?
<DragonRage> The sheer length of it makes me nervous.
<Ignaesia> >Havent read FO:E yet
<Ghosties> Exactly
<mysterypony> already did
<RainBroDash> 10apokalipse we still love you
<Purple`Prose> FO:E?
<Hipster_Brony> not even like /oat/
<SraKe> lulwot
<EspyLacopa> David Bowie in the Naruto The Abridged Comedy Fandub Spoof Series Show.
<thetrollside> well maniac
<Ghosties> Well, I'm sure SOME people would
<Apokalipse> :)
<Hipster_Brony> it would be like /b/
<thetrollside> it gets sad
<Ghosties> But still
<prince-dari> I have no problem with unmoderated rooms.
<thetrollside> some points
<DragonRage> Fallout: Equestria.
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> Oh
<Apokalipse> I missed out on all the manly tears though
<Ghosties> dari, no
<RainBroDash> 10film's over
<mobileDCD> okay sorry internet fell
<Rocker32703> I'm tempted to read. Is it really all that good?
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> I was thinking of that title
<Darf14> Will that lame ever learn?
<RainBroDash> 10wb DCD :>
<mysterypony> pinkie pie and her balloons
<thetrollside> its best fic eva
<mobileDCD> also which films won?
<prince-dari> Ghosties: No what? That's just my opinion.
<Elky> Stare Master now?
<Ghosties> I know :P
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> My Little Pony tiem.
<NewManiac> Rocker, it's awesome.
<Rellek> Because Europe
<Darf14> I mean lamp
<Ghosties> But still, too much risk
<SraKe> Pony timw?
<RainBroDash> 10>:3
<DashAttack> dumb fabric
<Bane> : O
<Elky> arrgh, rellek!
<Rocker32703> Then I'll read it.
<Bjornfot> demm clicks
<prince-dari> And I probably have more IRC experience than most of you. :P
<Ziltoid> wrong episode?
<EspyLacopa> Gold silk
<mysterypony> she looking at us
<thetrollside> NEIN ZE LAG ISH HERE
<NewManiac> I want to see that computer wallpaper.
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> Feat/ Cutie Mark Crusaders!
<charmin> derp
<Elky> I can't bring myself to hate that phrase
<Rocker32703> This is Stare Master.
<thetrollside> oh god
<SraKe> SHes breaking the 4th wall
<thetrollside> she sees us
<Ghosties> That wouldn't matter in an unmoderated room, would it?
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> *Feat.
<RenegadeBrony> Awwww sweetiebelle is adorable.
<Fengor> question, why is it that the view of your desktop is so small on the stream?
<NewManiac> And Rocker, be warned. It's 600 pages long. literally.
<RainBroDash> 10GIEF TEH PONIES
<Rocker32703> Oh neato. xD
<DragonRage> Sweetie Belle is always adorable.
<Ignaesia> Sweetie Belle is the best crusader
<Apokalipse> She is pure marshmallow, my god!
<Hipster_Brony> 8Scootaloo is only good CMC
<Rocker32703> I'll take my time reading it then.
<prince-dari> What I'm saying is that in my experience people tend to look after themselves.
<Elky> what ignas said
<DashAttack> yes
<Rellek> Every pony is only good pony
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD, it's Battlefield Earth and The Godfather
<prince-dari> All you need is a spam filter, links filter.
<Rocker32703> RIBBON
<thetrollside> i hope it gets turned into a book
<charmin> sweetie belle is the best of the CMC
<NewManiac> Hipster, all CMC are best CMC.
<Ghosties> Still, it would look bad on us
<Elky> also hipster, you like anything that remotely looks like dash
<SirSprinkles> 6And yet there'd be trolls.
<mysterypony> hell
<RainBroDash> 10No newmaniac. no.

<prince-dari> You can't mod all rooms 100% of the time.
<Hipster_Brony> 8elky: eeeeeyup
<Elky> so I kindly disregard your opinion on the cmc
<CAJ> Hipster_Brony you keep saying that, but I don't think you know what it means.
<Ghosties> And there'd be an aweful lot of people favoring it
<Hipster_Brony> 8dealwithit.jpg
<thetrollside> rainbow pony is best pony so duhhh
<Purple`Prose> And then Rarity murdered everypony. THE END
<NewManiac> Why not, RainbBro?
<Ghosties> Yeah, you can, for now
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> Thumbs up for Cartoon Noises
<NewManiac> RainBro*
<Ghosties> There's just the one room
<prince-dari> Especially if we plan to have chats where people talk all the time.
<DragonRage> Balloon!
<Purple`Prose> The sweet, sweet song
<mysterypony> magic with me
<RainBroDash> 10newmaniac scootaloo is only good cmc :>
<EspyLacopa> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/07/id-tech-camp-professor-converts-entire.html <-- Heh
<Angel_Espeon> 13!espeon
<Rocker32703> I can't pick any favorites for this show. Seriously. The Mane 6 are all great in their own way. So are teh CMC.
*Espeon now belongs to Angel_Espeon for 8 minutes
<Ghosties> I have faith that we'll be able to look after the rooms when S2 starts
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
<Purple`Prose> BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAR
<Aponymous> 0Of course an overgrown chicken thinks Scootaloo is best CMC
<charmin> freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeens
<mysterypony> rainbow dash took a bath with rainbows and cupcakes
<RainBroDash> 10espylacopa we're still streaming, ask mods if you need to post a link, but technically no links :<
<Ghosties> That's why we're doing so much hiring as well
<Purple`Prose> NO
<Rocker32703> If I HAD to pick, I'd choose Fluttershy and Apple Bloom respectively.
<SirSprinkles> 6Especially since we should have a good few more mods by then.
<mysterypony> <_>
<Ghosties> Sathi
<NewManiac> RainBro, Scootaloo is awesome but Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom are adorable.
<Ghosties> Gotta look at her app
<DragonRage> Saying which of any of the ponies is my least favorite is like saying which ice cream flavor I least like.
<SirSprinkles> 6We're looking to have AT LEAST two mods beneath each of us.
<lighty> I shoild be sleeping
<Purple`Prose> Rarity has a -job- you silly filly. Stop bothering her
<Hipster_Brony> oh yeah, DCD
<Rider> I'm sorry sis, I didn't think cartoon physics would take hold
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> WHAT NOW
<Hipster_Brony> Sathi applied
<JetTheLatios> Why'd you come back on Lighty?
<DragonRage> And I have never had ice cream I didn't like.
<JetTheLatios> xD
<Angel_Espeon> 13What time is it there?
<lighty> But iPads can be handy
<Elky> it's that artificial stuff
<Hipster_Brony> and she is QUALIFIED AS FUCK
<charmin> I hate you FS
<Rocker32703> *jaw drop*
<Darf14> Rarity has it right, time = money
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Agreed, DragonRage.
<SirSprinkles> 6AMAZING application.
<Elky> with weird colors
<Ghosties> Six main mods, 12 half ops
<SraKe> I hate that cat
<lighty> Im not tired yet xD
<Elky> I don't like that ice cream
<mobileDCD> okay guys gimme a sec to explain what I'm thinking
<Hipster_Brony> I want her on the mod team sooooooooo bad
<NewManiac> FORESHADOWING!
<Pattyrick> it's 11:52 PM
<Rocker32703> >:3
<mobileDCD> she's in.
<mysterypony> u mad
<mobileDCD> I've said it a million times.
<Rocker32703> Did you see the cats face?
<Purple`Prose> Trollpal
<charmin> no, just no
<RainBroDash> 10Am I the only person who thinks if you eat chocolate icecream with ANY other icecream, it instantly ruins the flavour of that other icecream?
<DragonRage> Opal is best hairdresser.
<Rider> Dat Grin
<Darf14> Dang, that cat is deadly
<mobileDCD> we need a female mod.
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohay, you're one hour ahead of me
<Bjornfot> cats are best pets
<Ghosties> We can't just TAKE HER
<SirSprinkles> 6LOL
<Purple`Prose> AMEN
<Sathi> agreed
<Darf14> agreed
<Rider> That damn cat
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Suddenly, hair grown back
<Apokalipse> I just don't like chocolate icecream
<NewManiac> And, Rainbro, you have to admit Sweetie sing in this episode awesome.
<DragonRage> Chocolate ice cream is pretty strong, yeah.
<mobileDCD> this mod room is too much of a sausagefest
<Ghosties> She has to go through the proper interview, silly :P
<Ignaesia> stream is lagging me
<lighty> Yep
<Hipster_Brony> were gonna interview her on weds at 5 Eastern anyway
<Purple`Prose> I have two cats. Or rather, two cats have me
<SirSprinkles> 6Well, we're doing interviews Wednesday
<RainBroDash> 10What's with all this SHES A GIRL WE NEED HER xD
<Elky> dunno rainbro, I never eat chocolate ice cream with anything else
<Sathi> hehehe
<Sathi> not trained them?
<Pattyrick> yeah, because I'm in Italy :P
<lighty> In timezone +1
<Rocker32703> I think Sweetie Belle's cutie mark should be a bell. It's a play on her singing talent and her name.
<SirSprinkles> 6Metal_Link at 4 and her at 5
<RainBroDash> 10NewManiac oh shit... true.
<DragonRage> I actually had this one kind of chocolate ice cream that tasted kinda like coffee.
<mysterypony> nope
<Ghosties> DCD, how old are you?
<RainBroDash> 10DAMN YOU MAKING ME QUESTION ME
<Purple`Prose> A bell with a bow
<mobileDCD> obviously. I'm just messing around.
<lighty> heya zapdos
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Rocker: In Hoity Toity's words
<Zapdos> hi
<HaveTubaWillTravel> BRILLIANT
<DragonRage> I thought I didn't like it at the time, but then I finished it anyways.
<Elky> I think Sweetie Belle's Cutie Mark should be a Slowpoke
<mobileDCD> 19
<Purple`Prose> I love how it takes a second for her to register
<NewManiac> And Apple Bloom is adorable in episode 1.
<DragonRage> And then had more.
<SirSprinkles> 6Also, I CALL HER FOR MY ROOM
<Rellek> YAY!
<SraKe> God damn Sweetie is a ninja... Ninjaing that gold silk
<SirSprinkles> 6DIBS
<Ghosties> PFFFFFFFFFFFFT
<mobileDCD> turning 20 in September, should it be any consolation
<Ghosties> Whatever Sprinks
<NewManiac> ya
<Hipster_Brony> http://thesportsblahblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/i_called_it.jpg
<Purple`Prose> Yay
<RainBroDash> 10shotgun with sprinkles in his room x)
<NewManiac> yay*
<Elky> y'know, because she's slow
<Ghosties> I found you, so, technically, she's mine
<CAJ> THE CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS!!! yay
<thetrollside> my fammily doesnt know i like ponies and theres one in the same room as me >_>
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> My Little Pony : KIDS ARE F***ING A*****ES
<Darf14> U MAD RARITY?
<mobileDCD> relax, bucko
<Purple`Prose> And then Rarity killed Sweetie Belle
<DragonRage> Worriedshy is cute as a button.
<Rocker32703> I'm not sure what Scootaloo's or Apple Bloom's cutie marks would be.
<SirSprinkles> 6...I dunno RainBro, depends on who else we get. :D
<prince-dari> Lol wow.
<RainBroDash> 10bucko
<SirSprinkles> 6trololololol
<prince-dari> You guys are so possesive.
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<Hipster_Brony> whoa guys
<DragonRage> Apple Bloom's is a hammer.
<Purple`Prose> TROLLY BELLE
<RainBroDash> 10dari this is madness
<Darf14> in an alternate cut Rarity rages out and kills everyone
<Ghosties> We gotta mark our territory :P
<Hipster_Brony> lets decide the teams later
<mysterypony> SUPER AWESOME CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS ADVENTURE WHOO
<RenegadeBrony> Alright Bronies, thats about it for me, been up all night and I'm off to hopefully catch some z's.
<mobileDCD> by the time we implement the room system I fully expect us to have more than a single female mod
<Aponymous> 0Trollie Belle
<RainBroDash> 10hipster we're having some fun
<RenegadeBrony> Night everyone
*JetTheLatios waves.
<Ghosties> Yeah, we'll decide all that later
<SirSprinkles> 6I was just joking for the most part. XD
<Bajar> Scootaloo's cutie mark is a picture of RD
<JetTheLatios> :>
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Sweet dreams Renegade
<SraKe> Applebloom=2x4
<Elky> Scootaloo's cutie mark should be a doormat
<DashAttack> rofl
<Purple`Prose> Rarity's taking this surprisingly well...
<DragonRage> Ciao, Renegade.
<Sathi> sleep well Renegadebrony
<Aponymous> 0Night Renegade
<Ghosties> And yeah, we were just joking hip
<RainBroDash> 10thetrollside flaunt it
<lighty> Well

<lighty> Gnite then :3
<Ghosties> brb
<RainBroDash> 10night dude
<Rocker32703> lol
<JetTheLatios> By Lighty :3
<NewManiac> My family knows I like ponies but it's not that they think it's girly. They think bronies don't exist.
<Rellek> yay!
<mobileDCD> anyways you guys
<Pattyrick> goodnight, lu! =D
<Darf14> For angels there horns are really showing
<Rocker32703> I love Fluttershy. xD
<SraKe> Hah
<NewManiac> But they do think it's girly.
<SirSprinkles> 6So, interviews Wednesday, trial-by-fire on Friday for Soarin and possibly them?
<Aponymous> 0Hear that? CMC are not Ponies, they're small creatures.
<mobileDCD> back to business
<DragonRage> Show them us, NeManiac.
<DragonRage> NewManiac*
<Purple`Prose> Fluttershy is mai waifu
<mobileDCD> dari, I need to know if there's any way to conceal a channel's name
<Metal_Link> Oh Fluttershy you are such a girl.
<JetTheLatios> Patty
<NewManiac> I'VE TRIED!
<JetTheLatios> Wanna pm? :O
<Bane> Futtershy monologue is so cute
<Rocker32703> I'm not much for waifu's - but I relate best with Fluttershy.
<Pattyrick> Jetty
<Pattyrick> sure
<Fengor> The Everfree Forest, scary because physics apply there
<SirSprinkles> 6Not on fail mibbit
<prince-dari> From who, the person who's on it?
<thetrollside> rainbow pony is best pony, everypony knows that 8D
<Darf14> Sure Twilight, I believe you, for now
<SraKe> ~yay~
<JetTheLatios> They call me Jedi
<JetTheLatios> But sure
<Hipster_Brony> i told soarin we would consider him for the next round of mod hirings
<JetTheLatios> :>
<Apokalipse> My family must never know about ponies <.<
<mysterypony> and not rape them
<charmin> fluttershy = butters of south park
<Pattyrick> Jedi mastah!
<SirSprinkles> 6I know Hipster
<SraKe> Halos
<RainBroDash> 10when you do a whois you can see the names of all the channels they're in
<mobileDCD> from the common user, yes.
<RainBroDash> 10D:
<Rocker32703> They will at some point, Apokalipse
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/lHZDe.jpg
<Pattyrick> IDK how to start xD
<Rocker32703> Ponies are taking over the world
<Lambda> sonic rainboom irl
<Metal_Link> Are those tickets?
<Purple`Prose> and then, Angel killed the annoyances
<Hipster_Brony> what im saying though is that we arent doing a trial run for him
<Darf14> CHAOS!
<mobileDCD> here's why:
<Bjornfot> inb4 accidentaly perspective
<Apokalipse> Not a hind of ponies here yet
<SirSprinkles> 6Why not?
<Apokalipse> hint*
<Rocker32703> Sweetie, how'd you do that?
<NewManiac> I've been meaning to sit my family down and show them Party Of One.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Derpyloo
<mobileDCD> when I proposed the unlimited room, it was for a reason.
<JetTheLatios> I am your father
<SraKe> I told my Mom and she didn't believe me
<JetTheLatios> owo
<Pattyrick> you're kidding
<Elky> I guess you Fluttershy lovers love Bubbles best too.
<DragonRage> Distressedshy is cute as a button.
<Fengor> did you show her EQ daily?
<Pattyrick> ....right?
<mobileDCD> what if all other rooms are filled?
<Elky> like
<prince-dari> It'd involve either me making an IRC client (which I've done to some extent), or hosting a server and adding modules to it which would be a lot of work.
<Hipster_Brony> we can do it when he's actually going to become a mod
*JetTheLatios is not a Star Wars fan.
<JetTheLatios> lol
<Hipster_Brony> it will be better
<Rider> Fridge Horror = If the CMC never disobeyed Fluttershy, Twilight would have remained petrified and missing
<Ghosties> We can just raise the cap, DCD
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD, we can raise the caps.
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not hard.
<Elky> When Blossom is infinitely better
<Pattyrick> neither am I
<Ziltoid> YAY
<JetTheLatios> And yeah :P I am owo...
<Aponymous> 0Oh God, Rider is right.
<Purple`Prose> Like most children, the CMC have no sense of danger
<Rocker32703> Suddenly blackness
<JetTheLatios> Are you kidding too?
<mobileDCD> should we have an unlimited room, the user would be redirected there in such a case.
<Pattyrick> maybe I am
<DragonRage> Honestly, I didn't really like the Powerpuff Girls.
<NewManiac> Fengor, I don't think that would help. That's just one site.
<charmin> rider has a point
<Elky> slow sweetie
<DragonRage> Loved the show, though.
<Darf14> With their voices combined the create wind
<Pattyrick> but the question is, are YOU kidding?
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> SPOILER: Twilight was a Stone
<Purple`Prose> This is why anime always picks kids to pilot robots are capture monsters
<mobileDCD> how will we know that we NEED to raise the cap, though?
<Fengor> then show her the know your meme entry
<mysterypony> and she lv 4
<Ghosties> We can just look
<Hipster_Brony> DCD, are you really expecting 1500+ people?
<RainBroDash> 10DragonRage THIS IS MADNESS
<charmin> cutie mark crusaders pokemon trainers
<Rocker32703> Oh Fluttershy
<SirSprinkles> 6Redirect them to the questions room I was proposing.
<mysterypony> inb4
<Zapdos> o.o
<mobileDCD> we need some sort of measurement, ja?
<Elky> I like the show, and blossom is kinda likable too
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I wanna be the very best, like nopony ever was
<Purple`Prose> Hammer
*Ray wakes up
<SraKe> Aww
<RainBroDash> 10inb4 hammer
<RainBroDash> 10FUCK
<Ignaesia> Hammer!
<DragonRage> This! Is! Um... a place.
<Purple`Prose> hamer
<Rocker32703> Hammer.
<Pattyrick> That was a short sleep
<NewManiac> I converted a friend of mine by asking Poychan to tell me their age, gender, and why they like the show.
<DashAttack> STOP
<Ray> 02No. I'm serious
<RainBroDash> 10You win this time purple...

<RainBroDash> 10in after hammer
<mysterypony> table: kill me
<JetTheLatios> For real :O?
<SraKe> tlc
<mysterypony> later
<NewManiac> DAMMIT! This is always how IKEA turns out for me!
<charmin> you're not using power tolls, are you?
<mobileDCD> events like the Fighting is Magic tournament. Somewhat plausible.
<Ghosties> Look, DCD, we just can't have an unmoderated room
<Ghosties> We just can't
<Apokalipse> Just noticed how my family will find out about ponies!
<DragonRage> Apple Bloom looks so funny there.
<Nittany_Tiger> Hammer sounds like saws?
<charmin> tools
<Ignaesia> EEEEEEEEEEE
<Rocker32703> This part always makes me daww
<Apokalipse> OH NO
<Hipster_Brony> Let's use the Derpy room for overflow
<HaveTubaWillTravel> MC Hammer Pony wants one
<Ghosties> That would look bad on us, the guys that run the stream
<DashAttack> I LOSE!
<charmin> i lost the game!
<Rocker32703> I LOSE
<CAJ> inb4 squeek
<DragonRage> World Championshy is cute as a button.
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, Derpy the question room.
<SraKe> Squee
<Ghosties> And most people enjoy that we're good at our jobs
<Fengor> I love the squeak noise Fluttershy makes sometimes
<CAJ> SO ADORABLE
<Bane> awwwww haha
<Bjornfot> SPIT OR SWALLOW WOMAN, SPIT OR SWALLOW
<charmin> dammit
<Rellek> i love that squee sound
<mobileDCD> let me state correctly what I'nm trying to say, though.
<Ziltoid> NO
<Rocker32703> NO
<Hipster_Brony> we can assign mods there if we have people
<Elky> he, you'Re all worse than me!
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> inb4 NO
<Elky> wait...
<HaveTubaWillTravel> They all lost the game
<Purple`Prose> Such a cuddly pony
<SraKe> BO!
<mysterypony> yes
<SraKe> NO!
<Ghosties> You said "mostly unmoderated"
<Rocker32703> Snuggly wuggly?
<thetrollside> NEIN
<mobileDCD> forget the unmodderated stuff
<mobileDCD> it will have mods
<Ghosties> That just can't work
<Hipster_Brony> ok
<Rocker32703> Dark
<Bane> Cutie mark crusader chilean coal miners!
<NewManiac> I actually ordered some pony toys online. So I'm sure my family will be happy to see that on Facebook.
<SraKe> Yes and capes
<DashAttack> this episode needs more Sweetie Derelle
<Purple`Prose> Yay!
<DragonRage> My bed won't be snuggly wuggly for a few more months. =/
<Ghosties> DCD, you said mostly unmoderated, now you're not
<Ignaesia> I think Fluttershy sold MLP to me, she is the most adorable thing ever
<Rocker32703> Aww.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> IKR. Have they made an official Fluttershy plushie yet? Or is it just Twilight and Pinkie?
<Ghosties> What are you getting at?
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> inb4 Hush Now Quiet Now
<Hipster_Brony> 8NewManiac: i am jelly
<charmin> dude, coal miners have a tough live
<thetrollside> inb4 epic fluttershy singing
<RainBroDash> 10inb4 EPIC
<Bjornfot> AWW YEAH
<mobileDCD> forget what I said earlier, except for the "unlimited" part
<DragonRage> <3
<RainBroDash> 10whelp, wrong chat
<Elky> maybe their special talent is dreaming?
<thetrollside> <3
<prince-dari> People don't just go crazy because there aren't mods on.
<RainBroDash> 10>.<
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> inb4 Loud song
<Apokalipse> I am aquiring diabetes
<HaveTubaWillTravel> All I can think of is the PPG in bed
<Bjornfot> Sweetie rocks the flank off of Fluttershy.
<Purple`Prose> GOSPEL MODE ACTIVE!
<RainBroDash> 10SO EPIC
<Rocker32703> I told you Sweetie Belle was gonna be a singer.
<mysterypony> nope
<Elky> also, induring eppic fluttershy interruption
<Hipster_Brony> 8i liked Fluttershy's version more
<NewManiac> Hipster_Brony, ponyorders.wordpress.com
<Fengor> Sweetie Bell is so black
<mobileDCD> now consider this.
<DragonRage> Panickshy is cute as a button.
<SirSprinkles> 6Dari, it's trolls I worry about.
<Rocker32703> I liked Flutter's better too. xD
<thetrollside> TOOT TOOT
<RainBroDash> 10Hipster just go die kthxbai
<HaveTubaWillTravel> BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
<charmin> seeeeeeeeeeeensaaaaaaaaasiooooooooooonaaaaaaaaaal AUCH!
<Ghosties> And all you need is one person to get spam going
<Aponymous> 0You woke the Scootaloos
<Elky> I prefer Sweetie Belle's
<Ghosties> So yeah, mods are needed
<prince-dari> Filter kicks people who spam.
<SraKe> ELIZABEAK!
<Hipster_Brony> dari, have you been on ponychan?
<mysterypony> sweetie blacklle
<Rocker32703> YEAH
<Ziltoid> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<prince-dari> Links can be disabled.
<Ghosties> dari, if we have all these mechanisms, then why do we have mods?
<thetrollside> rainbow pony is best pony, shy pony is best singing pony
<Elky> ugh, worst pun ever
<Rocker32703> Come back here you little asshoel
<Hipster_Brony> when people find out there isnt a mod on, they go crazy
<Ghosties> We might as well not even be here
<mobileDCD> we could raise the caps for the rooms, yes, but what happens if it's raised far more than what our mod squads can handle?
<SraKe> GET OVER HERE ASS HOLE
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> GET OVER HERE YOU ASSHOLE
<mysterypony> where your wing!
<DashAttack> dat stare
<Rocker32703> STARE
<Elky> pink pony is much better singing pony
<Purple`Prose> I! FLUTTERSHY OF EQUESTRIA, COMMAND YOU TO GET BACK IN THE DAMN CHICKEN COOP!
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> DUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
<Ghosties> DCD, that's why we plan on having new mods
<prince-dari> Ghosties: To ban people, and decide if what people say breaks the rules.
<thetrollside> YOU COCKS ARE BEING MONITERED
<SirSprinkles> 6We hire more mods and make more rooms, DCD?
<Ghosties> That's why we're hiring
<NewManiac> I learned that song on guitar. Also, the toy I got was the molded 4-pack. Not those shitty looking brushables.
<DragonRage> Dominantshy is... okay sorry ma'am, I'll stop.
<SraKe> Theres some good chickens
<Ignaesia> ALL GLORY TO THE FLUTTERSHY
<prince-dari> If mods aren't on, people can be banned when they get back.
<Rocker32703> ^_^
<mobileDCD> now I'm not saying we won't have cap increases in these cases
<Ghosties> It's not right to have a "no hands on" approach
<thetrollside> OHSHIT
<Bane> Fluttershah
<charmin> fuck you fluttershy
<Ghosties> We'd be detached from our own stream
<Elky> FLUTTERS FOR THE FLUTTER GOD
<Purple`Prose> Fluttershy is either a Druid, or she has a Geas
<mobileDCD> but a cap increase just seems mostly as a temporary solution.
<thetrollside> i was allmost caught watching this
<RainBroDash> 10I don't get it. If we expect people to be good in the unmoderated chat, why have it?
<Ghosties> Not to mention that we'd want to see the eps as well
<Rocker32703> charmin, the door is to your left.
<Elky> what charmin said
<mobileDCD> yes.
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD, as I just said, we could add more rooms and hire more mods.
<mobileDCD> that's what I'm getting hat
<mobileDCD> however!
<SirSprinkles> 6i.e. CMC rooms.
<Ignaesia> anypony else just want to hug Fluttershy?
<DashAttack> i do!
<Purple`Prose> I do
<DragonRage> All that brohoofing in there was adorable.
<thetrollside> me
<Apokalipse> I do
<mobileDCD> we need a way to make a headcount, ja?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> At least one, Ignaesia
<HaveTubaWillTravel> :D
<Ziltoid> I want more then hugs
<SraKe> Talking to her self
<Rocker32703> Too quiet!
<Ghosties> Look
<Fengor> I met a guy at school who said when he watch MLP episodes he keeps porn open in a browser window so he can switch that if anyone walks in on him.
<Purple`Prose> I want to hug her and pet her mane and tell her it'll be okay
<Ignaesia> Heheheh :D
<charmin> no
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, I'm saying we'd have a questions room.
<NewManiac> thetrollside, accept it. If people leave hate you for it, they were never your real friends.
<The_Kataklyst> Fluttershy is the cutest ever
<Hipster_Brony> do you guys mind if we do this on skype?
<RainBroDash> 10lmfao fengor
<Stormy> o.o
<Elky> hug her all you want, then she can't be in the episodes at least
<SirSprinkles> 6...why?
<Ghosties> Yeah, let's skype
<Hipster_Brony> makes it easier to keep an eye on the main room
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Well said, NewManiac.
<mobileDCD> we raise cap, redirect people to their desired rooms, WITH A CATCH
<SirSprinkles> 6No.
<SirSprinkles> 6I can't.
<Purple`Prose> Door's to your left, Elky
<Ghosties> Talking is easier than typing
<SraKe> Fengor Yah I read that a a comment on youtube...
<Ghosties> Well, Sprinks can't
<mysterypony> applebloom, did you learned everything from the last time when you enter Everfree Forest?!
<RainBroDash> 10I've had a solid eye on the main room all the way through this
<Elky> nope, it's to my right
<Hipster_Brony> i just meant by typing
<Ghosties> Because ofSDOFEOUIAHEFOHWEFUAWLEUIHLEF
<RainBroDash> 10euromod be handling it
<Elky> to my left is the window
<DashAttack> though, i think i wanna brohoof out of Rainbow Dash more
<SirSprinkles> 6...just by typing is fine.
<mobileDCD> we ask them to remain in the unlimited room, just not chatting.
<Bjornfot> inb4 scootaloo
<DragonRage> She learned that adults are silly and that nothing bad can happen to fillies who enter the forest.
<Ignaesia> in b4 SCOOTALOO
<DashAttack> minus the out
<mobileDCD> just the mibbit tab open.
<Ray> 02Yep ._.
<SirSprinkles> 6DCD, QUESTIONS ROOM
<Ghosties> So what you want is to silence the unlimited room?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> She did learn something, but Scoot and Sweeite are bad influences
<Rocker32703> SCOOTALOOOOO
<Ghosties> Not fair to them
<HaveTubaWillTravel> *Sweetie
<RainBroDash> 10in after ignaesia ruins the fun
<Darf14> sorry....did I went too far?
<thetrollside> who else wants a brohoof from rainbow dash then >_>
<SraKe> Scootaloo ScootScootaloo!
<RainBroDash> 10SHUUNNN
<Pinkamina> SCOOTALOO! SCOOT-SCOOTALOO!
<Elky> SCOOT SCOOTALOO
<DragonRage> Scootalooo!
<SirSprinkles> 6We could set up a counter for how many people are redirected there.
<SraKe> y U!
<mobileDCD> so we can see the user numbers and react accordingly.
<mobileDCD> basically a room that allows us to do headcounts.
<Rocker32703> ARGUING
<Ignaesia> rainbrodash :(
<Pinkamina> Scootaloos everywhere
<Elky> Applebloom is epic troll
<DragonRage> The trees are alive!
<Hipster_Brony> 8inb4 4chan
<mysterypony> foxnews
<CAJ> If Fluttershy is so scared of the everfree forest, why does she live so close to it?
<DashAttack> apparently just me thetrollside
<Rocker32703> Eee
<Ignaesia> eeep
<thetrollside> but
<Purple`Prose> Because she needs to be on hand
<Purple`Prose> er, hoof
<thetrollside> rainbow pony is best pony
<thetrollside> ;_;
<Purple`Prose> in case something bad happens
<SirSprinkles> 6If the room was on mute constantly, I'd be okay with it... and raising caps immediately.
<Rocker32703> Dun dun dun
<ChaoMagma> 4Osha-Hello
<HaveTubaWillTravel> CAJ: Maybe she's scared BECAUSE she lives so close
<Ghosties> As I was gonna say, we can't gauge for anything really until Season 2 starts and we see how many viewers we get
<charmin> creepy time
<HaveTubaWillTravel> But the rent on her cottage is so good, she can't just move
<DashAttack> hipser isn't paying attention, or he'd agree
<Aponymous> 0Twi got pretty stoned
<mysterypony> she dead
<Fengor> I want a life sized Twilight statue
<mobileDCD> if we have, say, 300 people in the unlimited room, we KNOW we have to make another room, and so on.
<Rellek> She lives close to it for the critters
<NewManiac> Twilight looks *sunglasses* stoned. YEAAAAAH!
<Ghosties> I just don't think it's fair to completely mute an entire room
<Bjornfot> Dear Princess Celestia. Today I saw a cock and got totally stoned.
<SirSprinkles> 6FOX NEWS
<Darf14> Oh no! She been stoned!
<The_Kataklyst> Don't move!
<charmin> duh
<RainBroDash> 10Faux News*
<JetTheLatios> Lati-o hi
<JetTheLatios> :D
<Elky> What's weird is that fox news actually covered bronies the most positively.
<Ghosties> Likewise, I like the six mane rooms
<ChaoMagma> 4:3
<Hipster_Brony> 8fengor: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
<Ghosties> idea
<SraKe> Everyone shut up
<RainBroDash> 10LOL ELKY NO
<Ghosties> that is
<ChaoMagma> 4Jet~
<SirSprinkles> 6They'd be directed to another room almost immediately, Ghosties.
<Rocker32703> Cocka what now?
<Elky> My Little Pony: BETTER THAN TERRORISM
<Darf14> If you believe Fox News I will call child services on you brain!
<Bjornfot> inb4 r34
<mysterypony> a cock
<Rocker32703> xD
<RainBroDash> 10Did you not see that RIDICULOUS program covering bronies elky?!
<mysterypony> teehee
<SirSprinkles> 6The mute is just to prevent problems.
<Nittany_Tiger> http://forums.filefront.com/pub/437886-document-richard-nixon-library-fully-proves-fox-news-100-republican-propaganda.html
<mobileDCD> additionally, by using a system like this, we can make it so that mod squads have a lesser load.
<Ghosties> Why mute a room?
<RainBroDash> 10No links dude
<RainBroDash> 10:<
<mobileDCD> see what I'm getting at?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> A cock. It's a terrifying creature with the body of a snake
<Ghosties> What's the point
<WhatPayne> "A cock a what now?"
<Nittany_Tiger> Sorry
<thetrollside> hipster isnt a true fan of rainbow
<Hipster_Brony> ghosties
<Rider> Dear Princess Celestia, I just got stoned by a monster cock
<thetrollside> >:(
<NewManiac> Elky, the fuck are you talking about? They called us equal to men that dress as babies and stay home.
<Hipster_Brony> its so we get a headcount on how much overflow we have
<Darf14> If you stare at it too long it will blind you
<charmin> 3 chickens
<DragonRage> Seriously, the cockatrice really is one of the silliest mythological creatures.
<Hipster_Brony> then they get redirected
<ChaoMagma> 4how are yuu?~
<Ghosties> It doesn't need to be our main room though
<mobileDCD> I just want a way to supervise the amount of viewers we have so we can do the necessary preparations
<mysterypony> better then zombie ponies
<SirSprinkles> 6It would just be an overflow room dude.
<SraKe> NOOOOOOO ELIZABEAK!
<DragonRage> The only reason it has half a dozen "turn you to stone" powers is because nobody could take it seriously if it didn't.
<NewManiac> That cock is *sunglasses* hard YEAAAAAH!
<RainBroDash> 10dragonrage: >silly, mythological
<JetTheLatios> I'm fine
<Darf14> Good thing Link never encountered a chicken like that
<thetrollside> barak obama

<DashAttack> FLutterboss
<RainBroDash> 10Darf14 implying that an army of cuccoos isn't all-powerful, unlike this weedy little stone-making cockawhatnow
<Ghosties> That's another thing, depending upon the amount of people we'd have in a room like that, I don't see how it'd be possible to direct certain people to certain rooms without people filing our improperly
<HaveTubaWillTravel> YOUR MOTHER
<Quanyails> 7I'm still on a YouTubeWalk. o.o
<DragonRage> But yeah, Badasshy is best pony.

<SirSprinkles> 6That would be me. :D

<Bjornfot> eeyup
<thetrollside> anyone notice how cups in equestria are modeled for human hands?
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Hey everypony, is there anything to contradict the fact that Rarity could be making Sapphire Shores' capes in this ep? Winter Wrap Up/Fall Weather Friends proves not all episodes are chronological, so...
<SilverSonic> PRESEA

<Darf14> Dear Princess Celestria: Today I learn the feeling of being stoned, I actually like it and I want to experience it again, so I made it my mission to find that chicken again. Your faithful student Twilight Sparkle
<Rocker32703> Wait wat?
<mobileDCD> however, there is a problem if we use the questions room

<JetTheLatios> owo
<thetrollside> anyone notice it?
<CaitSith> Lies.
<Ghosties> If we had the six main rooms, Questions room, Requests room, Mod room, that makes sense. What I'm trying to wrap my head around is that DCD suggested silencing the room, and now he's not
<Lolipop_of_Doom2> Ok guys
<mysterypony> hot damn
<RainBroDash> 10NewManiac thanks for telling me I'm an idiot after I announce it in full caps :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13Of course
<prince-dari> I think the only plausible way to sort this out is set up a server.
<mysterypony> it
<Angel_Espeon> 13:P
<Rocker32703> Well, what if it were Hoity Toity needing those as well?
<Rellek> :P

<Ghosties> This is why we need to have skype sessions
<Bjornfot> Dear Princess Celestia. Today I got totally stoned, and learned to avoid cocks thanks to my dear friend Fluttershy. PS could you ask Luna if she wants to go out with me?
<Hipster_Brony> 8Dash x Dash is best ship

<Rocker32703> I have to be honest, I've never watched this show.
<ChaoMagma> 4though xros wars is more like transformers :P
<RainBroDash> 10Sathi Nigel Thornberry (the ghastly man with the incredible nose) just randomly became popular on the internet
<Rocker32703> Is the little boy mentally unstable or just hyperactive?

<HaveTubaWillTravel> INTERIOR CROCODILE ALLIGATOR
<Ignaesia> didnt like this show, my favourite nicktoon was AHHHH! Real Monsters
<Rocker32703> Alligator pissed off for no reason?
<NewManiac> Hipster_Brony that's what I thought when I was about to watch the second Care Bears movie recently.
<Darf14> The weird creatures that you can find in swamps are Red Necks and Hillbillies.
<charmin> real monsters was good too
<Hipster_Brony> 8NewManiac: wat
<charmin> but rocko is the boss
<Hipster_Brony> 8never compare care bears to the wild thornberries
<Ignaesia> oh yeah and rocko
<DragonRage> Isn't that the one with DARK HEART?
<Rocker32703> She's gonna drop it.
<Ziltoid> DERP
<Fengor> and they lose the watch
<Ghosties> 4Wild Thornberrys is only good for Nigel
<Aponymous> 0Dumb bitch, a compass is supposed to do that
<Rocker32703> Oh hell
<Ghosties> 4And Rocko is the best animated show on Nick
<Rocker32703> Exactly. She's an idiot. xD
<NewManiac> Hipster_Brony, they both suck. DragonRage, yes it is. And Ignaesia, Rocko was the shit.
<Darf14> I Personally like Invader Zim
<CAJ> Ghosties that's not how you spell Invader Zim
<Ziltoid> I am the cheese
<Elky> thanks for explaining Apon, I didn't get it until then
<thetrollside> thats not how you spell my little pony
<charmin> crazy alligator lady
<thetrollside> dumbasses
<Ghosties> 4>CAJ actually thinks Invader Zim is better than Rocko
<DashAttack> CAJ, don't be silly
<Ghosties> 4Zim was only good for Dib's sister
<RainBroDash> 10Oh, while the numbers gradually diminish, I'd like to say that I really appreciate all you eurobronies clocking in for the stream, we love you. I share your pain if you live in one of those areas where there's no other bronies around and it sucks. That's what this saturday stream is for <333
<Ghosties> 4Gaz
<Elky> heh
<DashAttack> everything about Rocko was awesome
<Hipster_Brony> 8>implying Invader Zim was a good show
<DashAttack> Zim had Gir
<Ghosties> 4Gaz was the only reason to watch Zim, while Rocko was amazing all around
<DragonRage> The mosquitoes really dig Nigel Thornberry.
<DashAttack> oh, and Gaz
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Thanks, RBD <3
<CAJ> >implying that's not just your opinion, Hipster_Brony

<Elky> >implying implying
<charmin> MR BIGHEAD > Squirdward
<Hipster_Brony> 8CAJ: dealwithit.jpg
<Aponymous> 0I'm confused by Nick's treatment of Invader Zim. What did they expect from a guy who made Johnny The Homicidal Maniac?
<RainBroDash> 10thetrollside I have to show some love for my eurobronies, it's saturday <3

<NewManiac> I will drink a rainbow!
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Inb4 Rainbow Dash Laugh
<Bjornfot> In sweden we refer to 20xx as "the 20-hundred years"
<Elky> 2001+ - 21st century. It's kinda logical if you think about it
<Srake> katapony damacy
<Elky> oh, didn't know that
<Bjornfot> it is, but it's confusing
<Ignaesia> 21st century as 0-99 was the 1st century
<Bjornfot> most european languages do tha
<Sathi> I like this compilation
<Pattyrick> gah, my internet went blah
<NewManiac> Bjorn, what about 0xxx-0099?
<Elky> they do? german doesn't
<Pattyrick> Aww, Jet left D=
<Srake> this is like half a movie
<SirSprinkles> 6It's sad because this is longer than a pony ep...
<Bjornfot> we don't usually casually talk about years 0-99
<Angel_Espeon> 13I need to buy some more batteries before Monday
<Srake> yah...
<Angel_Espeon> 13My mp3 player's battery died today and I need to replace it :<
<Pattyrick> what kind?

<Angel_Espeon> 13AAA
<Bane> Are you guys accepting video requests?
<Polarfire> yay
<Elky> bane: only if you ask in caps
<Darf14> lol
<Bjornfot> or "around 100"
<Pattyrick> that's interesting, never heard of an MP3 player using AAAs
<Angel_Espeon> 13it's depressing when I'm listening to a song I really like and it suddenly cuts off and dies |D
<Aurora> 6I hate batteries, they always die at inopportune times
<Elky> dat horse
<RainBroDash> 10xD
<TheKataklyst> Lulz
<Aurora> 6my mp3 uses AAA

<Srake> *Srake has left the chat*
<Elky> srake: story of the blanks
<Elky> look for it
<Elky> it's cute
<NewManiac> Elky, you beat me to it.
<SilverMane> Story of the Blank was awesome, but this song was in it?
<Zapdos> made american anime look good..
<Elky> nope
<SilverMane> I thought it only had the opener
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Srake is still here

<Polarfire> I sisn't get story of the blank. what was it supposed to mean?
<Polarfire> *didnt
<Zapdos> not cartoons, but the anime mimics
<Elky> it's about applebloom
<NewManiac> SilverMane, no. This song is by RainbowCrash88 and was featured in Dash Away.
<Angel_Espeon> 13.w. Tomoya's English voice, I'm not too keen on it
<Polarfire> I know but why?
<Srake> lol beer
<Angel_Espeon> 13Don't get me started on Sunohara, he sounds like he hasn't reached puberty yet
<Darf14> Wait the song is different on the Newgrounds game my mistake

<Zapdos> lol
<Srake> hah jesus

<Srake> My little street fighter
<NewManiac> Can I post the link to Story of the Blanks?

<Ziltoid> um whats this?
<maxaminusOne> That shit is unwatchable.
<Elky> I love this song
<Bjornfot> Fun fact: Lauren Faust originally wanted to feature Seaponies in FiM, but couldn't due to time and budget constrains.
<SilverMane> IT'S APPLEJACK
<Ignaesia> Leaked footage from season 2
<Hipster_Brony> 8that old AJ is a horrorshow
<RainBroDash> 10bjornfot take that heresy somewhere else
<Elky> it's better than half the songs in FiM
<maxaminusOne> lol Ignaesia
<Hipster_Brony> 8elky: nope.avi
<Elky> old AJ's voice is great
<Lolipop_of_Doom> @SilverMane nope.avi
<Apokalipse> but if Lauren Faust did sea ponies they would be AWESOME
<Bjornfot> ^

<HaveTubaWillTravel> Ever notice how AJ humanisations often look like Megan in the hair and clothes department?
<RainBroDash> 10BUT WHO WAS GRATE?
<maxaminusOne> They'd probably be some sinister fusion of ponies and Naga
<HyperMetalLugia> Creepy
<SilverMane> BUT WHO WAS PHONE
<NewManiac> Turns out, it's Dash Off. Not Dash Away.
<Srake> BUFFER!
<maxaminusOne> ah, ty

<SirSprinkles> 6...*twitch*
<Polarfire> Oh. Didn't realize sorry:(
<RainBroDash> 10brb
<Darf14> Just to warn you its considered as a art game so don't expect any type of quick button presses
<SilverMane> i did play that game... it was terrible...
<HaveTubaWillTravel> ...what a shame this was made pre-Best Night ever
<Elky> eh, the game is short anyway
<Elky> terrible?
<SilverMane> well, not very fun
<SilverMane> Story of the Blanks was great
<Elky> you haven't played luna's game, have you?
<NewManiac> Oh Celestia. I broke SirSprinkles.
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I've tried playing that game, but the zombies are fucking impossible. Maybe it's my slow computer, or maybe I'll just watch a playthrough
<SilverMane> i've had this song stuck in my head at work so often lately
<SilverMane> mostly the DBZ Abridged version
<NewManiac> I also recommend a cool game called "Luna Game."
<NewManiac> It has 2 sequels.
*SirSprinkles 6is surprised nopony has said anything about the Desktop Ponies yet...
<Bjornfot> NewManiac confirmed for troll
<Elky> trollhoof maniac
*SilverMane is about to kill NewManiac for paraspriting
<Hipster_Brony> 8cuz we cant see them sprinkles
<Srake> ...For 15 minutes
<SirSprinkles> 6WUT?
<Elky> but two sequels?
<SirSprinkles> 6That's AWESOME
<NewManiac> Bjorn, I'm sorry.
<Elky> never saw any
*Bjornfot glares evilly at SirSprinkles the liar
<SilverMane> what desktop ponies?
<SilverMane> i don't see any
<Elky> maniac, what sequels?
<ChaoAqua> 2so far
<SilverMane> there are 3 Luna games.
*SirSprinkles 6watches Apple Bloom spin on the screen
<Bjornfot> aww yeah
<NewManiac> Elky, Luna Game has two sequels.
<ChaoAqua> 2i am a zombie is confusing me
<Bjornfot> Have we watched Hercules yet?
<ChaoAqua> 2i thikn my brain has fried
<Elky> not counting the two different pictures?
<ChaoAqua> 2i'll need a new one
<Darf14> nope
<Apokalipse> not yet bjorn
<ChaoAqua> 2*think
<SirSprinkles> 6No Herc yet
<Bjornfot> damnit
<Elky> huh, gotta look for them sometime
<Bjornfot> i really need to win the lottery, then
<Ziltoid> That would be cool
<NewManiac> Elky, what do you mean by two different pictures?
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Do My Little Derpy - Episode 1
<NewManiac> And why would you look for Luna Game?
<SilverMane> Elky, if you want to play Luna Game, search it on EQ Daily
<Hipster_Brony> 8finally, a video with some Dash
<Elky> in the original game you had one pic of Pinkie and one of Applebloom
<SilverMane> the link takes you to a site that has all 3
<Hipster_Brony> 8SilverMane: TROLOLOLOLO
<Ziltoid> Dont
<Elky> just gonna look for playthroughs
<Darf14> I don't trust you
<Elky> I don't want it messing with my folders
<SilverMane> yeah, don't play that game. It's like the treat we don't speak of, but in a game
<Elky> heh
<SilverMane> poor Rainbow Dash...
<Elky> I watched the first one, but not the others
<Elky> that applebloom image is still scary
<NewManiac> I've yet to play them. I've only watched video of the first and read the synopsis' on Equestria Gaming.
<Polarfire> What time is it in the UK now?
<Ziltoid> the third is the most messed up
<Elky> 0:33
<ChaoAqua> 2can't decide where to go?
<SilverMane> just watch the videos, it's safer for your computer that way
<ChaoAqua> 2ohlookit'sSkylands
<Elky> eeeyup
<Srake> What?
<Skylands> 10His connection is bad
<Skylands> 10Hi Chao
<Bjornfot> >implying it could harm your computer
*ChaoAqua 2throws a cookie at Skylands
<Polarfire> cool.
<SilverMane> all 3 have play-throughs
*Skylands doesn't eat it
<ChaoAqua> 2wait
<Elky> well, it doesn't do harm
*Pattyrick eats it for her
<Elky> per se
<SilverMane> but it is annoying
<Polarfire> Luna game doesn't do anything except create a bunch of files.
<Hipster_Brony> 8for those who dont know, the luna game crashes your computer, so dont actually play it
<ChaoAqua> 2but to change names, don't yuu have to type it manually???
<Pattyrick> omnomnom, cookies
<Polarfire> That are annoying to remove.
<Elky> but it makes files and doesn't let you quit
<Skylands> 10It's a bouncer, Chao
<ChaoAqua> 2the cookie wasn't for eating
<Bjornfot> lol no hipster_brony it doesn't
<Elky> stuff like that
<junh1024-XD> I'm used to listening to the dub of CLannad, souyea
<ChaoAqua> 2it was to hit yuu on the forehead
<Pattyrick> What was it for?
*ChaoAqua 2flees
<Darf14> It can harm the computer, does it affect the hardware or the software?
<Hipster_Brony> 8it crashed mine
<Pattyrick> well, it missed, and I ate it
<Pattyrick> so too bad, you're out a cookie :P
<Polarfire> It didn't on linux :)
<NewManiac> Hipster, no it doesn't. It just makes a bunch of files. No harm done.
<Bjornfot> Hipster_Brony don't seem to know how to computar
<Elky> maybe your computer can't handle luna?
<ChaoAqua> 2then yuu'll asploud in a few seconds
<SilverMane> LUNEY LUNA
<NewManiac> His computer got scared.
<ChaoAqua> 2*asplode
<Darf14> I better run the game on deep freeze if I decide to play it
<Bjornfot> http://myfacewhen.com/i/451.jpg
*Pattyrick burps out fire
<SilverMane> hey, whoever is running the stream, can we watch the Hero pmv, starring Fluttershy and RD?
<RainBroDash> 10Oh, everypony who has been added by TehDavies on steam, that's me
<Polarfire> Just read about it on EQ daily.
<Elky> eh, it's easier to just watch the playthroughs
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, i guess it technically didnt crash it, but i couldnt exit out of the game
<Hipster_Brony> 8so i had to restart my computer
<RainBroDash> 10I added all the people i could fine
<Elky> it's not like there's actual gameplay
<RainBroDash> 10find
<Polarfire> yeah.
<NewManiac> Hipster, it does that. You have to use task manager.
<Darf14> so its not worth the time
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Can i do my Subbmition?
<Bjornfot> As I said Hipster_Brony, you don't seem to know how to computar if you couldn't even manage to close a simple program. http://myfacewhen.com/i/451.jpg
<TheKataklyst> *bobs head*

<SilverMane> fabulous dahlin
<NewManiac> I hope I haven't just made a reputation for myself as a parasprite. I will let you I am not.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not on steam currently.

<SilverMane> Trolling is a art
<BronyTj> ok, so what are are we watching this friday?
<RainBroDash> 10I did this yesterday :3
<Bjornfot> sure, newmaniac, sure...
<Elky> >implying we haven't already judged you silently
<SirSprinkles> 6Since I can't play from this wifi anyway...
<SirSprinkles> 6I know.

<RainBroDash> 10:<
<SilverMane> >implying it was silent
<SirSprinkles> 6:D
*Angel_Espeon is considering going to sleep due to boredom and slight tiredness
<Elky> >well, if I said out loud what I think of maniac's trolling...

<Hipster_Brony> 8the task manager
<BronyTj> ...
<SilverMane> love is never saying you're sorry. unless you are the man, then it's apologizing at the end of every argument.
<Hipster_Brony> RBD, im barely on Steam
<Bjornfot> then force it open, duh
<Hipster_Brony> i never use it
<TheKataklyst> *still head bobbing*
<Angel_Espeon> 13and Chao, I have NO IDEA how Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka is confusing to you :B It's pretty straight forward
<Ignaesia> Ok im playing Story of the Blanks how do I do that block pushing puzzle?
<Srake> Hammerbob
<NewManiac> I can judge myself too!
<NewManiac> Andy, you paraspriting bastard!
<CAJ> paraspriting is a art
<Elky> i dunno, there are good trolls and there are bad trolls, and if they're bad I wouldn't call it art
<Bane> I like to hold the power button on my computer. It's like I'm suffocating it to death
<Angel_Espeon> 13even easier to understand considering I already told you the base storyline xD
<Darf14> hmm.....try reseting the computer, its may be a little drastic but it might kill the program
<ChaoAqua> 2hmm
<SilverMane> Ignaesia, push the top 2 blocks all the way, then push the first of the bottom two out of the way
<Polarfire> Love is:
<ChaoAqua> 2well don't forget
<Elky> and if you're really good at it anything could be called art
<RainBroDash> 10BronyTj good question. The movies next week are: A Movie: The Godfather, B Movie: Battlefield Earth (lol), Ponies: Green isn't your colour, and Over A Barrel I believe
<ChaoAqua> 2i've only seen one episode :P

<Angel_Espeon> 13but when I found out that he's not the flesh-eating, rotting kind of zombie and that it's actually a comedy, I instantly loved it
*HyperMetalLugia can see the 3D perfectly with his glasses on
<NewManiac> HaveTuba, I read a fanfiction just like that.

<Elky> not as good as the real drunk cooking though
<Angel_Espeon> 13It's an anime where it eventually gets to the point where you consider a male zombie in a magical girl outfit to be perfectly normal to you |D
<Zapdos> oh wait, cross dressing, magical transforming zombie
<Srake> NOOOOOOOOOO!
<SirSprinkles> 6>implying I'm doing requests, btw

<maxaminusOne> lol Jack in the watercooler
<Zapdos> ya
<SilverMane> I am a member of a school group that is against the killing of seals. We made it into a club. We are no longer allowed to meet though, something about people disliking our motto. What's wrong with our name? Club Seals is genius name!
<Zapdos> that anime was pretty funny

<Sathi> ohwell my bad then
<Polarfire> Today, tomorrow, forever
<NewManiac> Anypony read the Ballad of Twilight Sparkle?
<Srake> Ithink crossovers are the best
<Polarfire> is pretty sad.
<Ignaesia> Ok Story of the Blanks was really cool but scary as fuck
<Bjornfot> LUXURY HOME BUILDERS

<Srake> Ad!
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Cutie Mark Crusader Luxury Home Builders
<RainBroDash> 10dat ZZ Top

<Srake> Ad went away
<Angel_Espeon> 13When you finish the anime, let me know what you think of it~
<SirSprinkles> 6No it didn't.
<NewManiac> Elky, Twilight goes to Manehattan to resolve legal problems with Trixie but it turns into musch more.
<Srake> awww
<RainBroDash> 10it's faint
<NewManiac> much*
<Elky> poor pinkie will ruin her neck
<Srake> it didn't
<SilverMane> Lyrical Musings is hilarious, especially after reading Out in the Cold
<Srake> go away
<Polarfire> durr hurr
<mib_e30hu8> Ballad of Twilight Sparkle is epic
<mib_e30hu8> so many crossreferences
<Elky> maniac, was it the one where twi gives trixie a new cart?
<Darf14> looks like Pinkie Pie is filling in for DJ-PON3

<NewManiac> Also, the Vinyl Scratch Tapes are pretty awesome.
<Ignaesia> I just finished that Story of the Flanks game btw, it scared the bejeesus outta me
<Srake> I liked Feathers of steel, Heart of GOld alot
<Elky> It's not where you go...

<Ignaesia> I wanna know what the story was about ues
<RainBroDash> 10NewManiac is so right. Vinyl Scratch Tapes. VinylxOctavia is one of those shipping pairings that just makes me all giddy and junk
<SilverMane> Unforeseen Turbulence is an epic shipper that introduced me to the term 'Wing Boner'
<Ignaesia> yes
<Sathi> hehe
<SilverMane> and it is really short
<Elky> nut I though dj octy was the canon name!
<Srake> ummm
<Sathi> my cats sit like that all the time
<Hipster_Brony> 8HOLY SHIT THAT LOOKS LIKE MY CAT
<Darf14> oh crud, a legless cat, it must me No Legs the cat
<RainBroDash> 10it is, hipster
<Hipster_Brony> 8EXACTLY like my cat
<SirSprinkles> 6My cat does that all the time. XD
<NewManiac> RainBro, it isn't really shipping so far. Except for Vinyl talking about their "date
<SilverMane> wtf, did you guys here Winter Wrap Up in the background?
<NewManiac> "
<RainBroDash> 10I broke into your house, stole your cat and filmed that
<Sathi> yay catlovers <3
<Elky> my cat is lighter
<Elky> and misses a tooth
<RainBroDash> 10oh yeah newmaniac, but that's why I love any fanfic that involves the two of them
<RainBroDash> 10>:3
<NewManiac> brb
<RainBroDash> 10shipping or not
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I aaaaaaaw'd at the I'm in hell part
<SilverMane> the ponies were such dicks in Over a Barrel, not one gave Pinkie support after her song
<Elky> now I imagine rainbro as a sneaky ninja cat thief
<Elky> it kinda works
<RainBroDash> 10elky you better believe it.
<SilverMane> YEAAAH
<Pattyrick> Floof
<Kalas> would you support pinkie in a hooker outfit?

<SilverMane> ILU TRIXIE
<Elky> Progress was awesome until she left canterlot. It was mediocre after that.
<SilverMane> I hope they bring back the two OC ponies from Canterlot
<Elky> also, it has LunaxBig Mac
<RainBroDash> 10i dunno when July - Moon is starting kalas
<Elky> agreed silver
<SilverMane> 'never ever EVER ask for a 3-some, no matter HOW hot it would be...'
<RainBroDash> 10but I'm lurking the stream

<Elky> it'sstar craft 2
<Elky> the trailer, but with ponies
<Darf14> It is Pony Craft 2, I hate dealing with the Parasprite rush

<Ignaesia> ahh right that makes never, never played that

<SilverMane> i'm on an Asus, running windows. Oh look, a right mouse button
<Elky> I use a mac and couldn't care less about this debate
<Zapdos> hi
<SilverMane> I hate that song
<Elky> also, I'll have to install windows on it anyway
<SilverMane> Windows on Mac defeats the point, in my mind
<Elky> since uni wants us to work with visual studio
<Elky> those jerks
<Darf14> I don't care about the debate, I like being in a middle of a debate war despite which side is winning
<Elky> I'll just partition it
<NewManiac> I don't use Mac or PC. I use an abacus.
<SilverMane> NewManiac is now friends with Luna
<Bjornfot> Elky, Visual Studio is BAWS for programming/debugging.
<Elky> maybe try out linux too
<SilverMane> sounds like Shaggy
<Elky> I just have to use it for the cli compiler
<NewManiac> SilverMane, what you talkin' 'bou?
<NewManiac> 'bout*
<Ignaesia> Spent my college time as a huge Mac elitist. Finished and looked for work, no company ever uses macs. mfw
<Elky> and I suck at programming anyway
<SilverMane> hey, random fact: The voice of Shaggy from Scooby Doo is now a DJ at a radio station near Flint, Michigan
<Ignaesia> haha thats awesome
<Elky> heh
<SilverMane> Newmaniac, Luna uses an Abacus in most of her fanfics
<SilverMane> KILL IT WITH FIRE
<Elky> lunaxabacus is best ship
<SilverMane> LunaxAbacus I have an image for that
<NewManiac> SilverMane, okay. I don't read a lot of Luna fic.

<SilverMane> night HaveTubaWillTravel
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm still gonna be here.
<Ghosties> 4Shit took me much, much longer than anticipated; I got locked outside my house for about 20 minutes
<SirSprinkles> 6Just updating the homepage with next week's lineup.
<SilverMane> well then screw you sprinkles! gawsh, makin me say bye and shit
<Elky> sounds vaguely threatening
<SilverMane> kidding kidding don't kill me!
<SirSprinkles> 6That. Sucks.
<Presea> o.o
<SilverMane> how long is this loop?
<Sathi> 1 hr at least
<Ziltoid> FOREREVER
<Sathi> :)
<Elky> ∞
<NewManiac> So, Srake how's the game?
<SilverMane> why didn't they do the Equestria Girls song for an hour? or even Nyan Pony
<Elky> that'd have been great silver
<Elky> oh well
<SilverMane> I survived over an hour of Nyan Pony once... was... horrific
<Darf14> This video is going to last FOORREEEEVEEERRR
<RainBroDash> 10welcome back :>
<NewManiac> My fondest memory of Yardiovich's stream was watching all of the 1 hour Equestria Girls.
<Elky> I had a screencap of me watching 1 hour of equestria girls but I deleted it today
<SilverMane> wow
<Srake> Wierd
<NewManiac> we called it "The Man Challenge."
<mobileDCD> guys I'm back
<SilverMane> i got about 20 minutes into EQ Girls loop before i got bored
<NewManiac> Those who quit were shunned.
<Ghosties> 4ANYWAYS
<SilverMane> wandered off to do other stuff
<Ghosties> 4yeah
<Elky> I was at the filly stream, why were those fighting by the way?
<Srake> I finished it...
<Ghosties> 4I apologize for taking so long
<NewManiac> Srake, how was it?
<SilverMane> speaking of, I have video games to play, like the Uncharted 3 beta
<RainBroDash> 10hey y'all
<Darf14> @Srake *clopclopclop*
<NewManiac> Fun, right?
<Srake> It was weird
<Srake> ok game though
<Darf14> It was also creepy
<Elky> oh, welcome back at sane country srake
<SilverMane> needs sequels or more length
<Elky> creepy? not so much
<Elky> but weirdd
<SilverMane> Hey, who here has read Bittersweet?
<Srake> Such is the fate of Blank Flanks
<mobileDCD> Rainbro have you installed Killing Floor
<NewManiac> Srake, she was going to ruin the party. We coudn't have that.
<Darf14> @SilverMane Depends on what you are talking about, does the character have a scarf and the other has a bow?
<Srake> yep
<Elky> then no
<SilverMane> @Darf14 what are you talking about?
<thetrollside> its still going? xD
<Ziltoid> Isnt blank flank really just a ripoff of big fish?
<Darf14> Oh I thought you are talking about something else
<Darf14> nevermind
<SilverMane> Bittersweet is a sad-fic starring RD and PP, really long, but awesome
<Elky> we're on a loop while sprinkles works on the site trollside
<Darf14> Yeah I was thinking of something else completely
<thetrollside> to be an alicorn is sadder
<thetrollside> :S
<Elky> uh... okay
<SilverMane> the first chapter parodies the saddest episode of Scrubs perfectly
<NewManiac> Three words: circle of Friends.
<Drake> 04Is everyone in a more talkative mood today?
<SilverMane> to be an Alicorn IS pretty sad. The Sun Never Sets is depressing
<Elky> saddest episode of scrubs? I remember something like that...
<Pattyrick> I wish I was
<Elky> which one was that?
<NewManiac> Elky, the one with How To Save A Life?
<Elky> ugh, epic sax is melting my memory
<Elky> I'll look it up at eqd
<RainBroDash> 10kalas if you're still here dude thanks i was sorting some stuff out
<Presea> rawr
<RainBroDash> 10hoping for a july - mc final personally
<Kalas> I'm still here
<Kalas> same
<RainBroDash> 10I think so
<NewManiac> What is the song that somepony said to listen to while reading Circle Of Friends?
<RainBroDash> 10checkan
<thetrollside> id bring it up but ive said it earlier and id look like an ass
<mobileDCD> I'll be home in a while
<SilverMane> saddest episode of Scrubs is the one with the funeral of the one guy who's nameslips my memory
<SilverMane> Circle of Friends?
<mobileDCD> that way you can help us get Ghosties's achievements
<Ghosties> 4Sprinkles, what did you want to talk about
<Quanyails> 7Drake?
<Elky> heh
<Ghosties> 4And yes, I WANT MR. FOSTER
<Srake> How does he play Saxophone with one hand
<Darf14> Dang, I thought it ended
<Elky> magic
<thetrollside> cause hes epic
<Kalas> but mostly I want to see good games
<SilverMane> oh fuck, one of those fics. and now I need to read it
<SilverMane> i need to read 33 more fics by next Sunday
<Kalas> i heard that most of the quarterfinals sucked
<Kalas> many <10 minute matches
<Srake> I'm officially sick of shipfics
<RainBroDash> 10>.<
<SilverMane> how to save a life would be pretty sad with a fic like this
<mobileDCD> Ghosties here's the plan
<Ghosties> 4i don't like being idle
<Elky> why srake?
<RainBroDash> 10I want some good, straight up macro matches with long bouts of harassment
<mobileDCD> we make a password-protected beginner room
<Srake> Just way tooooo many
<thetrollside> wich one silver?
<mobileDCD> and get the ten achievements
<Elky> hm
<mobileDCD> we leave the map achievement for last
<thetrollside> bittersweet?
<Ghosties> 4Sounds good. Also, question?
<Elky> silver: why, are you a prereader at eqd?
<RainBroDash> 10harassment and people trying to out-macro, instead of manage to all in harder
<Ghosties> 4Can it just be me, you, and RBD in the game?
<mobileDCD> when it's time for the map achievement, we go into another server, with actually experienced players
<Ghosties> 4I'd like to play with people I know >>
<Elky> or do you have a personal schedule?
<Ghosties> 4That's fine then
<Kalas> pretty much this
<Sathi> i'm soooo going to bed with this tune in my head...
<Sathi> later on
<SilverMane> I would love to become a prereader, as I have nothing after work typically
<thetrollside> so whats next fridays choices
<mobileDCD> yeah, for the first ten
<mobileDCD> The last one...we're going to need heavy backup, baby
<Elky> so you just read up on fanfics for fun?
<Darf14> this tune is driving me crazy, isn't that right Mr Computer mouse
<Ghosties> 4What's the last one like?
<mobileDCD> we have to kill the Patriach, and he is a BITCH
<Kalas> but I'm affraid that this will be pretty cheesy
<SilverMane> pretty much, I keep a Fanfic Faves post on Flankbook, which I need to do today or tomorrow again
<thetrollside> anyone? D:
<Ghosties> 4You mean the "COME ONE, COME ALL" wears a top hat and has a chain gun guy?
<mobileDCD> Beating Abusement Park in Normal or Above
<NewManiac> SilverMane, Circle Of Friends is a sadfic. Here is the link: http://miburl.com/XWXb3I . But you have to read it while listening to this song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Ih_Bvnjpc.

<Senor_BroZilla> Wait until his computer station times out from streaming I guess
<NewManiac> Elky, massive clopfest.
<Elky> uh... okay
<Senor_BroZilla> There was a discussion that somehow got around to talking about RedTube roulette and motherless
<Senor_BroZilla> last week, I think it was
<Elky> what's redtube roulette?
<Elky> I know motherless is a game...
<Kalas> gg
<NewManiac> You have Elky interested.
<Kalas> oh lord
<Hogia|GIMP> 7._.
<HyperMetalLugia> hrm

*Hogia|GIMP 12balances ot the colours :3
<Hogia|GIMP> 12*out
<Senor_BroZilla> Anyone care to explain? I'm dying of laughter right now and I don't think I can do it justice
<idahoninja> It's on the internet and it's obscure, what do you think?
<RainBroDash> oh god. I come back and people are talking about motherless
<Elky> oshit
<RainBroDash> 10At least wait till mods are asleep
<Ghosties> 4Nothing much, we're just closing the stream
<RainBroDash> 10;)
<WhatPayne> Well I guess that means I'll hit the sack too. Night ya'll.
<NewManiac> Elky, I'm guessing, like Chatroulette with more tits.
<Senor_BroZilla> Yes, mods need their chloroform, then BMN afterdark can really begin
<RainBroDash> alrighty, killing floor soon?
<Elky> I thought chatroulette was exclusively penises?
<Senor_BroZilla> Night, WhatPayne, may your dreams be filled with Deathstalker's cheesy one-liners
<Elky> night payne
<Nittany_Tiger> Ugh.
<WhatPayne> Thanks

<WhatPayne> :)
<Bjornfot> YOU GOT MAIL
<Nittany_Tiger> I've seen way, way, way too many masterbators on Tinychat.
<Senor_BroZilla> Redtube roulette is taking four random numbers (generally from a post on an imageboard)
<RainBroDash> I'll go when the stream is over
<Ghosties> 4Same here
<NewManiac> ANSWER YOUR DAMN MAIL SPRINKLES!
<Senor_BroZilla> and putting it in the redtube video URL
<RainBroDash> plus I want to make sure this motherless discussion doesn't continue while I'm here
<Elky> which will return porn?
<Senor_BroZilla> And you must watch/clop to it, no matter how horrendous you may find it
<Elky> oh, okay
<Senor_BroZilla> precisely
<Hogia|GIMP> 12fff, I lost my coloured layers D:
<Elky> I've seen some of this on 4chan, but really, who does that?
<RainBroDash> I don't mind people talking about porn late in stream, but some of the stuff on that website..
<RainBroDash> oh lawdy
<Ghosties> 4Motherless?
<NewManiac> Okay. *closes eyes* 6483. Someone now has to do that. Lord knows I won't.
<Ghosties> 4Wutttttt
<Elky> I always thought it was trolling
<idahoninja> Not it.
<Sol> Given what's on redtube, it could be
<Elky> >implying it's possible to clop with epic sax guy on
<mobileDCD> it's like fancy european wording for "bastard"
<mobileDCD> I guess?
<Senor_BroZilla> WELP
<Kalas> epic sax guy is pure unfiltered sex
<RainBroDash> 10>implying I don't clop to epic sax guy
<Senor_BroZilla> At least there's a girl involved
<Kalas> dat pelvic thrusting
<RainBroDash> oh. lol
<RainBroDash> no no no
<Bjornfot> >implying spike humping is not DEAD SEXY
<RainBroDash> it's a porn site
<Lolipop_of_Doom> RainBroDash
<Ghosties> 4Motherless is a...uh
<Ghosties> 4Yeah
<Ghosties> 4Porn sit
<Ghosties> 4e
<RainBroDash> let's call it that.
<NewManiac> I nominate *closes eyes and runs finger along chat list* Kalas.
<Lolipop_of_Doom> I think why you got mod
<Elky> now that you mention it... he is oddly endearing
<idahoninja> that's more belly thrusting than pelvic...
<mobileDCD> really?
<Kalas> FFFFFFFFF
<mobileDCD> I'm guessing a bad, grosstastic porn site ja?
<RainBroDash> 10kalas can't clop, he's watching starcraft matches :P
<Kalas> double rax
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Because you went through 10 brony movie nights
<RainBroDash> 10 2rax?
<Ghosties> 4It's not for your vanilla porn people
<Sol> If you really want a good dangergame, use stileproject instead of redtube
<Kalas> yeah
<Ghosties> 4I used to go there
<RainBroDash> 10fffff
<Ghosties> 4But it's dangerous, viruses plague the site

<Armageddon> ._.
<Aurora> no lol
<Silverscreen> Is anypony here?
<Polarfire> ME IM HERE
<Silverscreen> Were you here for the lottery today?
<Polarfire> yes I was
<Polarfire> thank you I was getting sooo lonely..
<Silverscreen> Would you mind telling me what the showing order is and what'll be playing?
<Polarfire> You have no idea...
<PTS> Yea
<Polarfire> um.
<PTS> The first one was better
<Polarfire> Ok give me a minute.
<Polarfire> One was battlefield earth. The A movie iirc.
<Silverscreen> ...no way.
<Silverscreen> There is no way in hell Battlefield Earth would be selected as the A movie.
<Polarfire> yes way.
<Polarfire> I think it was. in fact I'm about 99% sure.
<Polarfire> Now that I think about it.
<Polarfire> Sorry I would have remembered better if I had known I would be quizzed...
<Polarfire> >.<
<Silverscreen> If Battlefield Earth is the A movie, then The Super Mario Brothers movie is an oscar winning masterpiece.
<Polarfire> but I'm almost positive about battlefield earth.
<Polarfire> and lol.
<Silverscreen> It's fine, thanks for telling me at least one of the movies.
<Polarfire> they had some wierdies picking tonight.
<Polarfire> and the b movie was something I've never heard of.
<Polarfire> trying to think...
<Polarfire> one of the eps was green isnt your color.
<Polarfire> Im positive about that.
<Polarfire> and the other was over a barrel.
<Polarfire> yep
<Polarfire> did that help?
<Polarfire> I can't remember order.
<Polarfire> ugh that's going to drive me crazy
<Polarfire> ah you got it. The godfather.
<Polarfire> why didn't I remember that XD
<Silverscreen> The GODFATHER?!
<Polarfire> yes.
<Silverscreen> I'll be missing a damn good BMN. >.<
<Polarfire> u not gonna be there?
<Silverscreen> Fucking dialup.
<Polarfire> you can't watch the streams or something?
<Polarfire> I thought I saw you on one before...
<Silverscreen> There's absolutely no way The Godfather was selected as B and Battlefield Earth selected as A. You HAVE to had that backwards.
<Polarfire> Probably.
<Polarfire> hey I said I didn't remember order....
<Polarfire> but yeah then I got it backwards.
<Silverscreen> Dialup.
<Polarfire> I've never seen either movie in its entirety, so not sure which would be likely to be b and which would be a.
<Silverscreen> It takes me forever to refresh a page on Ponychan, there's no way I can get a stream to work with this internet.
<Polarfire> have you always had dialup?
<Polarfire> wow it really must be pretty bad XD
<Polarfire> are you going to be here for a little while?
<Polarfire> Noooooo! don't go to sleep D:

<Silverscreen> 2
<Silverscreen> XD
<Polarfire> yeah
<Polarfire> lol I can't type this late.
<Polarfire> but yeah it was pretty.... awful.
<Polarfire> in a good way XD
<Silverscreen> I was able to follow along with UP because of the comments in chat. XD
<Polarfire> yeah up is a classic. I love up.
<Polarfire> Pixar magic.

<Silverscreen> :D
<Polarfire> so... Is it fun being a mod XD
<Silverscreen> So Deathstalker was bad?
<Silverscreen> Yes, especially during the Saturday and special showings.
<Polarfire> lol. Yeah it was pretty bad. Like I said, my first time seeing it.
<Silverscreen> whenever chat's slow, us mods tend to be a bit playful with our powers. :D
<Silverscreen> I'll be sure to look that movie up with netflix.
<Polarfire> lol. It must be fun. Hey I have a good idea!
<Polarfire> You guys should do like a mod for a day thing XD
<Silverscreen> Yea-no. :P
<Polarfire> On second thought that might be a bad ides
<Polarfire> *idea
<Silverscreen> probably would.
<Polarfire> Have you never seen deathstalker 2?
<Silverscreen> Nope.
<Polarfire> Oh. Don't. Its torture.
<Polarfire> Only on BMN was it bearable.
<Silverscreen> haha, that bad?
<Polarfire> I had the others to encourage me.
<Silverscreen> Couldn't have been worse than Spider's Web.
<Polarfire> I almost left a few times. It. is. AWEFUL.
<Polarfire> I wasn't here for that...
<Polarfire> and I'm glad based on what I've heard about it.
<Silverscreen> oh, yeah, THAT was torture.
<Polarfire> lol
<Silverscreen> It was PAINFUL
<IsaacClarke> Yup
<Polarfire> I've never seen it and I don't plan too.
<Polarfire> Hey, we have 3!
<Silverscreen> good idea.
<Silverscreen> No, he left
<Polarfire> Its a PARTY!
<Polarfire> :(
*Silverscreen is using mIRC for his chat.
<Polarfire> aww man.
<Polarfire> I think the most comfortable chat is 4-8 people. You can have legit conversations without things moving too fast.
<Polarfire> Its like IRL i guess in a way.
<Silverscreen> In a way, yeah, I know what you mean.
<Polarfire> during the movies its hard. There's like 10 things going on at once. And I really like talking to people.
<Polarfire> Especially other bronies like me.
<Polarfire> Do you play any instruments?
<Armageddon> bbl movie
<Silverscreen> I used to play the trumpet, but I kinda fell out of it.
<Polarfire> I play piano
<Polarfire> and I love it.
<Silverscreen> Awesome. Pianos are good instruments.
<Polarfire> There's so much feeling in piano. Everything from jazz to rock to lullaby's sound good on it.
<Polarfire> What kind of music do you listen to?
<Silver> Success.
<Polarfire> please stay
<Polarfire> UGH!
<Polarfire> Oh...
<Polarfire> I thought there was a party...
<Silverscreen> 11I switched to Mibbit.
<Polarfire> Oh ok I see.
<Polarfire> Cool :)
<Silverscreen> 11yep
<Polarfire> if I have miirc can I just join this room when I want?
<Silver> Whoops.
<Polarfire> i r confused
<Silverscreen> I accidentally the chat.
<Polarfire> oh.
<Polarfire> ees fine :)
<Polarfire> So can I join this room from any chat software?
<Polarfire> or just mibbit.
<Silverscreen> Any irc software can join the server and room that BMN uses.
<Polarfire> Thanks.
<Polarfire> So what kind of music do you listen too?
<Silverscreen> the server irc.irchighway.net
<Silverscreen> The room is, of course, #Bronystate
<Polarfire> I see now. Thanks.
<Silverscreen> I prefer rock, personally, though I listen to anything.
<Alucard> Soyuz
<Alucard> http://toonamiarsenal.com/
<Alucard> \:D/
<Polarfire> me too. I like everything rock from 60's to 90's.
<Silverscreen> Rap, southern, blues, bluegrass, rock, techno, goth...
<Silverscreen> any.
<Polarfire> and of course pony music
<Silverscreen> Pony. :D
<Polarfire> I don't care much for hip hop as a generalization bu there are a few exceptions.
<Polarfire> no southern which is ironic for me.
<Polarfire> I hate vountry.
<Silverscreen> Good hiphop is indeed rare to find.
<Polarfire> mah typing is turrible XD
<Polarfire> Do you have many IRL brony friends?
<Silverscreen> Country in general is alright, though again, it's rare to come across something particularly good.
<Polarfire> Country music reminds me of my town. Which I hate with a passion.
<Silverscreen> I know that feel, bro.
<Polarfire> The music itself isn't that bad, but its just association I guess.
<Silverscreen> Makes sense.
<Polarfire> I like guitar music tho. which is in almost all country.
<Polarfire> but in a lot of other genres as well.
<Silverscreen> Guitar is great when used with old rock. :)
<Polarfire> Yes. Yes it is. Do you have many IRL brony friends?
<Silverscreen> None that I know of.
<Silverscreen> Hope to convert the few IRL friends I have. :D
<Polarfire> Really? none?
<Polarfire> me too.
<Polarfire> I live in an ultra conservative racist stuck up town with a jacked up social heiarchy government.
<Polarfire> It makes me mad.
<Silverscreen> I live in something similar. Not SO stuck-up, but it's certainly getting there.
<Polarfire> I hang out with the more liberal crowd anyway as a general rule, and even the most open minded of my friends didn't accept me being a brony :(
<Silverscreen> It's past the point of needing to know people to get ahead, at least.
<Silverscreen> I understand that.
<Polarfire> It was a bad feeling bc I thought he would tolerate.
<Silverscreen> :/
<Polarfire> He doesn't treat me the same.
<Polarfire> and I thought he was a good friend too.
<Polarfire> Oh well. In times of weakness people show their true colors.
<Silverscreen> Yeah, I know of that as well. -_-
<Polarfire> u leave??
<Polarfire> aww man...
<Polarfire> I'm sad now...
<Polarfire> :(
<Polarfire> Well I guess I'm going to leave :( sorry silverscreen if you some back in and I'm not here.
