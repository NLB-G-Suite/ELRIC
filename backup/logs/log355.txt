<kirzstryfe> 1,3we may be streaming the marathon here, ponies are more fun with more people :)
<TheDr> your internet hates you :(
<SayWhat> otakon, it's your internet's fault :(
<GabeMoist> AWWWW YEEEEAAAAAAAH

<SayWhat> Because CenturyLink is a troll company
<TheDr> who let these trolls in the company

<Midnight_Tempest> anime law 11 Law of Inherent CombustabilityEverything explodes. Everything.
<TheDr> ^LOOL
<Kencolt> Okay. Now he's Harry Potter.
<Moonlight> what's going on now
<Midnight_Tempest> Large cities are the most explosive substances known to human science. Tokyo in particular seems to be the most unstable of these cities, sometimes referred to as "The Matchstick City".
<otakon> TheDr, it's Mikoto Zondered
<TheDr> epic name
<SayWhat> This > Nagasaki + Hiroshima combined
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I know in the US the Hub is a mix of Hasbro and Discovery Kids, after DK flopped
*emangamer is not the biggest fan of anime "let the hating begin"
<TheDr> ^ thats funny
<Moonlight> Wait what is going on?
<Saturn> 08,01Midnight_Tempest: there is a more explosive substance, actually

<Saturn> 08,01it's called explodium, and cars are made of it
<GabeMoist> yay~
<NewDCD> 09,01err, Gai
<Midnight_Tempest> :D
<Kencolt> Actually, Tokyo survives quite often-- but the Tokyo Twoer gets smashed at least once a week.
<bear2229> .....
<Midnight_Tempest> that is true Saturn
<TheDr> saturn: LOLLLLLLL :D
<GabeMoist> erryone nekkid
<Darf14> Good gravy! There naked!
<Lasharus> So it would seem Kencolt. :P
<SayWhat> It's more rare than Unobtainium
<Midnight_Tempest> Law of Phlogistatic Emission: Nearly all things emit light from fatal wounds.
<SayWhat> Is unobtainium difficult to obtain?
<mario_pony> that kid just saw his brother naked.:P
<Moonlight> I have no clue what is going on
<Tovler> More rare than Tritium from Spiderman 2?
<TheDr> this is why anima is so damn epic!
<Saturn> 08,01TheDr: i'm choosing to read your name as "Thehdurr"
<SayWhat> Pikachu destroyed the city
<Saturn> 08,01:P
<Pegasister16> In a way, yeah.
<SayWhat> the end
<SayWhat> That's all you need to know about this movie
<TheDr> ?? wait whaa?
<GabeMoist> Why can't I hold all these robots?
<Kencolt> Well, Actually it's impossible to opbtain Unobtanium. However, it's rather easily aquired, gotten, gathered, and possesed.
<Midnight_Tempest> and this is how cities are repaired so quickly in anime
<SayWhat> Magnemite is now fixing everyting
<Darf14> They are rebuilding the city in 10 seconds flat
<Dken2021> they even have a plan to rebuild tokyo, it's like they knew the city get's it's a ss beat everyday
<Arceus-pony|Fancy> SUDDENLY ROBOTS

<Hazard3> in Game Informer it says the best video game line up in history was the SNES with Super Mario Bros.
<Corwyn> Well, yes, Memorable vs Good... One remembers the mistakes in life. Fortunately I never got that one.
<SayWhat> Super Smash Bros 64 is probably the best, then Mario Kart, then Starfox, then Golden eye, Then SM64
<Darf14> I was unfortunite enough to play Superman 64 when I rented it :(
<Hazard3> RENT?!
<IngloriousPony89> I remember that Hazard3
<Corwyn> Supersmash brothers, Blast Corps was another game that was interesting.
<Hazard3> WHATS WRONG WITH YOU!
<Darf14> :'(
<Hazard3> its ok
<SayWhat> Has anyone here played Croc?
<Hazard3> how far u get on ur rent Darf?
<Darf14> I WAS YOUNG!!! *sob*
<SayWhat> Croc is probably my number 1 game of ALL TIME
<IngloriousPony89> Murder time in Dark Souls
<IngloriousPony89> :D
<Corwyn> Except once beaten trying to get all platinum metals. I rented breath of fire so many times, always returned late because I wasn't finished yet.
<Darf14> I didnt have a memory card back then, so I never beat it
<emangamer> mfw I read Super Smash Bros as SuperBrony64
<Cypresswolf> I'd love to replay the original Doom...but despite growing up on MS Dos, I can't for the life of me remember how to open files with it now
<Hazard3> Darf14: its a very fun game but the stars get SCARCE!
<emangamer> Cypresswolf: it's called google
<SayWhat> So nobody here has played Croc... What is wrong with this world? Am i the only blessed sould to every lay eyes on the holy game that is Croc?
<BewareOfBunny> is anything playing or is my internet just not wanting to work?
<SayWhat> Refresh
<emangamer> I personally dont think SM64 holds up today...it was fun for the time but now it just gets rather repetitive
<Corwyn> There's a stream of a game playing right now.
<Hazard3> emangamer: ur right...still fun
<Corwyn> I need a platform jumping game that doesn't have the character shouting woohoo every time.
<SayWhat> Oh my god... I forgot it's almost 10 and i'm drink DP :P

*Rainbowjack hugs Derp3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai LadyCanary
<Ingwaz> i suspect i've been watching ponies a bit much. Heard the word "bit" earlier today and thought of equestrian money. Saw something with a W on the television airing schedule and thought it said wonderbolts

<Placebo> Ingwaz: That's dedication, holmes.
<MasterBrony> but they are bad quality
<otakon> Ingwaz: ah yes, the signs of TOO much pony
<Phase4> Ingwaz: you can never watch to much pony
<MasterBrony> well
<Placebo> ^
<MasterBrony> not bad
<MasterBrony> just not great
<Ingwaz> indeed Phase4, didnt say it was bad
*Midnight_Tempest is overjoyed with the addition of the ice cream and keeps eating
<Ingwaz> just said that i'd been watching it a bit much
<PonyFlare> To be expected with most old shows.
<TOY_PON3> :3
<MasterBrony> and they are REALLY hard to find
*Placebo is eating a chocolate chip cookie

<Placebo> Midnight_Tempest: Keep strong! *waves brownies in front of face*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14(\ LadyCanary
<MasterBrony> whats funny is all the characters from the OS that didnt survive the transition
*TOY_PON3 gives LadyCanary bird food. Get it cause she's a bird? ;)
<LadyCanary> Double is my favorite.
<Placebo> I love going home for the weekend.. I come back with noms
*MahBoi777 steals bag of brownies
<TOY_PON3> Just kidding
<LadyCanary> I am not bird. I am Black Canary!
<Placebo> O U
*Midnight_Tempest brohoofs the brownies into Placebo's face >_<
<PonyFlare> They somehow lost the rights to a few of them
<Ingwaz> saxy, planning on getting me3?
<PonyFlare> From what I understand
*TOY_PON3 gives LadyCanary jar of cookies
<TOY_PON3> :p
*LadyCanary noms the cookies
*Placebo takes all the noms, and pushes them somewhere else
<otakon> you nom those cookies!
<MasterBrony> the OS had 3 witches, teh 2 sisters and brother, and some creepy gnome guy that lived in a mushroom
<MahBoi777> NOM NOM NOM
<Placebo> ohai otakon
<kirzstryfe> 1,3toy/show rights were really screwed up back then
<otakon> yh

*TOY_PON3 noms on cookies and cream ice cream
<otakon> hurray
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Haven't played the previous ones >.>
<MahBoi777> forget you, I can eat all these sweets!
<Placebo> SaxyPretender: You need to. Now.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I've heard amazing things about the series though
<kirzstryfe> 1,3g1 had spike too, and I think I spotted a pony with trixie's cutie mark in one of them
<Midnight_Tempest> oh Saxy... i am disappoint
<Placebo> ^
*MahBoi777 a few minutes later
<Ingwaz> you dont have to, you can jump in regardless and the game will fill you in on the basics
<Armageddon> ohmygod
<Armageddon> nearly Altair's birthday
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777 is Pinkie Pie?
<TOY_PON3> :O
<Placebo> Importing your character >>>>> chosing a present
<SaxyPretender> 0,14true, but I like to have a solid background when it comes to series like that
<PonyFlare> There's one of the mane six that's from G1 yes?
<MahBoi777> Hi, I'm Wilford Brimley and I'm here to talk to you about diabeetus:S
<Placebo> I'm going to replay ME 1 and 2 because I lost my saves, just to have an import.
<Ingwaz> well sax, you can get the previous ones for like $15 each
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I have no money >.<
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I spent everything I had into Soul Calibur V
<TOY_PON3> damn you Wilford Brimley...:|
<Ingwaz> already had to do that when my harddrive fried placebo, whats your favorite class?
<MasterBrony> want to hear my theory on spike vs g1 - g3.5?
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3: I couldn't handle all that sugar
<Placebo> Ingwaz: I got ME and 2 other games for a total of 15 over a year ago.. lol
<Ingwaz> oh saxy saxy saxy, you make me sad
<PonyFlare> Sure
<Midnight_Tempest> im not sure if i'll be able to use my ME2 save if ME3 isnt going to be on steam...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I regret noooooooothiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
<MasterBrony> spike is preent in most of the OS and some of the movies
*LadyCanary spent her money on school books ;^;
<kirzstryfe> 1,3applejack was g1
<Ingwaz> not hatin on sc5, but me3 will be a better buy
<TOY_PON3> :(
<MasterBrony> pinkie pie was too if i recall
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and twilight, but she had different coloring
<MahBoi777> Sugar Rush!
<Placebo> Ingwaz: My main playthrough was with Soldier class. I guess that's my favorite, because of the teammates I love to use
<kirzstryfe> 1,3yeah, pinkie too
<Phase4> i might have bought me3 but origin is a poo poo piece of poo
<PonyFlare> :D
<MasterBrony> and RD
<Placebo> Lol dragonage.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...it would be ironic if I won my schools' SC5 tourney and used the money to get ME3 XD
<Ingwaz> you make me sad placebo, 80% of people who play me just pick the standard soldier
<Midnight_Tempest> doooo eeeeet Saxy
<Ingwaz> theres so much potential in the other classes that i dont see why people dot hat
<TOY_PON3> ^
<MahBoi777> Heavy eez credit to team!\
<LadyCanary> Lots of luck Saxy! Is there a set date for the tourney?
<MasterBrony> i believe that the reason most of the early G's ended
<SaxyPretender> 0,141st place is $50 GS gift card, 2nd is $25
<Placebo> Ingwaz: I've also used tech and tech/biotic. But I love using Garrus, so I try to stay away from Tech..
<Ingwaz> personal favorite is adept, but i've done infiltrator, sentinal, and working on a vanguard
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and yeah, tourney is the 28th
<MasterBrony> is because spike couldnt stand them and ate them
<Midnight_Tempest> awesome
<MasterBrony> i mean...look at the prook
<SaxyPretender> 0,14all day saturday
<Midnight_Tempest> you better win Saxy
<MasterBrony> proof*
<otakon> Ingwaz: GIVE me a Soldier any day
<Ingwaz> mordin is by far my favorite me2 squad mate
<Ingwaz> got to love the cracked out hamster
<PonyFlare> He did almost eat Rarity
<TOY_PON3> Saxy gots this!
<Placebo> Ingwaz: His singing voice. xD
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I'll do my best to win
<LadyCanary> You can do it Saxy!!
<TOY_PON3> Like I said, Saxy gots this ;)
<Ingwaz> they've apparently gotten a new voice actor for mordin....thats going to kill me on the inside
<SaxyPretender> 0,14just gotta keep training and learn Ezio
<Placebo> I enjoy the soldier, though. As good as your teammates are, none of them are as good of a shot as you are.
<LadyCanary> I believe in you! Kick Will's buttocks.
<MahBoi777> badaba baba bada space space wanna go to space
<MasterBrony> out of all the OS ponies, non survived each gen...but spike was found hibernating at the begining of each gen
<MasterBrony> new gen*
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yfw Will doesn't play SC5 XD
*Placebo doesn't know what sC5 is.
<Midnight_Tempest> Ingwaz: i always prefered Grunt and Zaeed as my squad
<MahBoi777> Soul Caliber
<SaxyPretender> 0,14SC5 = SOul Calibur 5
<TOY_PON3> ^
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<Placebo> oh. was thinking star craft. Lol
<LadyCanary> ...Ooopsie xD
<TOY_PON3> :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14aka my most anticipated game of the year
<MahBoi777> lol
<PonyFlare> Spike's the only one who stayed with each gen is he?
<MasterBrony> yea
<Midnight_Tempest> :D dat star craft 5 :D
<Ingwaz> they dont have to be as good a shot as you are Placebo, i use my gun heavily and my powers heavily
<SaxyPretender> 0,14don't worry, Placebo, I find that's a common thing to happen XD
<MahBoi777> :D
<LadyCanary> I just want my SkullGirls. NOW.
*TOY_PON3 hates Soul Calibur
<TOY_PON3> >.>
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Equestrians reincarnate, canon
<TOY_PON3> Sorry...
<MasterBrony> and several times hes found hibernating
<DoctortimeyWimey> SuperBrony64:
*MahBoi777 gives TOY_PON3 a shield
<Midnight_Tempest> i loved Soul Edge and the first 3 Soul Caliburs
<Placebo> SaxyPretender: honestly, at first I thought you just mistyped Cs5, and it was some art-sy competition..
*TOY_PON3 takes in hate
<Ingwaz> Midnight_Tempest: zaeed is a dick, he and I don't see eye to eye on our methods so i dont keep him around much
<SaxyPretender> 0,14heh
<Placebo> doctor_whooves127: O hai!
<MahBoi777> Like a Baws
<Placebo> Dat tab fail.
<DoctortimeyWimey> Does anyone know if SuperBrony64 is on?
<MasterBrony> so he eats the ponies, hibernates, then wakes up for the new generation of ponies
<doctor_whooves127> hi
<MahBoi777> hi DoctorTimeyWimey!
<MasterBrony> wash, rinse, repeat
<Placebo> DoctortimeyWimey: He hasn't been talking :s
<DoctortimeyWimey> I noticed.
<TOY_PON3> so many doctors
<Midnight_Tempest> Ingwaz, yeah same... but to get him to be loyal you have to be a renegade for his mission and one mission of being a dick is fine for me
<DoctortimeyWimey> Hmm..
<TOY_PON3> we need nurse otakon!
<MahBoi777> hi doctor_whooves127
<Ingwaz> no youdont
<otakon> um
<MahBoi777> Medic!
<Placebo> DoctortimeyWimey: Call him..?
<otakon> I'm not a nurse either
<Placebo> SPAH?
<Ingwaz> i refused to be renegade for that mission, punched him in the face, and still got his loyalty
<MahBoi777> ....oh
<TOY_PON3> otakon is a patient!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not necessarily true
<otakon> DoctortimeyWimey: hi!
<DoctortimeyWimey> I would but my phone is dead if he comes back on tell him to call me.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and suddenly ValtheJean
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if you're a REALLY high paragon
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you can keep his loyalty
<DoctortimeyWimey> I'm sorry I can't stay on.
*otakon hugs DoctortimeyWimey just bcause
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I've been here all the time -_-
<TOY_PON3> :D
<Midnight_Tempest> oh right...
<Ingwaz> yo ValtheJean
<otakon> ValtheJean: that was me, I was VERY Paragon
<Placebo> ^
<Placebo> Paragon playthrough as main, Evil sonnofabitch playthrough for the "why the hell not"
<Midnight_Tempest> i tend to do Zaeed's mission early in the game so i forgot about the high paragon thing
<Ingwaz> solid paragon as well, only time i use renegade interrupts in me2 is if the person drew a weapon on me, you draw a weapon on me and you're fair game now
<Midnight_Tempest> ^
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's the same with Morinth, though you can go either way
<Ingwaz> well Midnight_Tempest, if you import your me1 char and its got high paragon, you can still get by
<PonyFlare> Ah
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you just have to be REALLY high in it
*TOY_PON3 is now lost in convo :p
<PonyFlare> I see.
<MahBoi777> ಠ_ಠ
<otakon> eeyup
<Placebo> Lets dumb down the conversation, then..
<Placebo> Aeiou!
<Ingwaz> zaeed needed a really good punch in the face though
<Midnight_Tempest> my ME1 char was always neutral... about equal amounts of renegade and paragon
<MahBoi777> now you're speakin my language
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dude, I don't blame zaeed at all
<otakon> Basically, the game only rewards those who stick to one path
<Chocobo> Cool story.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he gets shot in the face by his closest partner
<PonyFlare> I see an analogy to R2D2 here.
<otakon> Zaeed was driven by revenge
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I'd be pretty fucking pissed too
<Placebo> spoilers.
<Placebo> Lol
*TOY_PON3 backs away from convo and noms on some more cookies
<ValtheJean> 2,14 phfff
<otakon> but I wouldn't sacrifice the workers for it
<kirzstryfe> 1,3wouldn't that mean g4 is before g1 then, assuming it's the same universe?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 oh noes, you know Zaeed was betrayed!
<Chocobo> Almost my birthday as well.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3since we've seen spike hatch
<Ingwaz> i doubt he considered him much of a friend, and i'd be pissed too, but you don't sacrifice innocent lives for it, thats now how i roll and its my ship
<ValtheJean> 2,14 he only talks about it, like, every chance he gets =/
<Ingwaz> not how*
<MasterBrony> interesting theory
<Midnight_Tempest> still i shit a brick at how awesome the DLC Arrival was... blowing up a whole system was badass
<otakon> eeyup
<Placebo> ValtheJean: Quite a few folks haven't played ME, but it was sarcasm. so yeahh..
*Shizuka 13yawns und curls up by the fireplace
<MasterBrony> the series COULD be like star wars
*TOY_PON3 decides to take shower while convo is still going
<PonyFlare> Maybe he just reverts to egg state with each major hibernation.
<TOY_PON3> brb
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: yeah, but that one fight was bullshit
<MasterBrony> 4,5, and 6 now
<Midnight_Tempest> yeah
<Ingwaz> "that one fight"
<MasterBrony> 1,2 and 3 later
<Ingwaz> thats real helpful otakon
*otakon puts a blanket over Shizuka
<Midnight_Tempest> the wave fight
<otakon> Ingwaz: I don't want to spoil
<MasterBrony> i dunno
<Ingwaz> that? that was easy
<otakon> not for me
*kirzstryfe smack PonyFlare with a logic, that's now how dragons work :p ;)
<MasterBrony> i think kirz is on to something here
<LadyCanary> Shizuka <3
<Ingwaz> should have gone adept then
<Ingwaz> adept is master of crowd control
<Midnight_Tempest> it wasnt for me... i was playing on hardcore >_<
<PonyFlare> Heh
<otakon> Ingwaz: I didn't, I was a soldier
<otakon> and Biotics doesn't work when they have shields
<Shizuka> 13canary~
<Ingwaz> and thats why i dont like soldier, sure, you've got raw power, but you're lacking in options
<DoctortimeyWimey> People everyone should hug SuperBrony64 ( use his username )
<Armageddon> ah
<Ingwaz> thats what guns are for otakon
*otakon hugs SuperBrony64
<DoctortimeyWimey> Get his attention please c:
<MasterBrony> that could also be why there are no witches in g4
*DoctortimeyWimey hugs SuperBrony64
<MasterBrony> cause they havent found the ponies yet
<Phase4> otakon: for a moment i thought you ment you were in the military
*SaxyPretender GIGA BRO HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGS SuperBrony64
<otakon> Ingwaz: I did! but by GOD so many at once with NO support
<Shizuka> 13but... we played "get SB's attention" last night..
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: ding!
<Shizuka> 13or this morning..
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: ding!
<Placebo> His Steam is away.. so he's probably not even at the computer..
<MahBoi777> PING
<Shizuka> 13or... TIMEZONES
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: ding! ding!
<DoctortimeyWimey> It's important
<DoctortimeyWimey> SuperBrony64: DING
<Ingwaz> i didnt have any trouble with it, and at least i'm fairly sure it was on veteran difficulty if not hardcore
<Midnight_Tempest> then send him a pm
<Simon2> sup everyone
<MasterBrony> but therein lies a new question
<Phase4> ohai Simon2
<Ingwaz> it got a little close near the end, but no great cause for concern
<Phase4> we're attempting to bug SuperBrony64
<MahBoi777> sup Simon2
<Placebo> DoctortimeyWimey: Why don't you just call him?
<Phase4> with copius pings to SuperBrony64
<Simon2> yo Phase4 MahBoi777
<MasterBrony> were the buck did the fluterponies come from
<MasterBrony> ?
<DoctortimeyWimey> I'll brb.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3you kept SB up too late Shizuka :p
<Simon2> Dat SuperBrony64's sister
<otakon> Ingwaz: hardcore, lvl 30
<Midnight_Tempest> Ingwaz: i was also playing soldier class that time around... soldiers always need someone around for biotic support
<MahBoi777> indeed, lol
<kirzstryfe> 1,3those are the fairy ones right?
<Placebo> Midnight_Tempest: I NEVER used a biotic.
<MasterBrony> yea
<Simon2> Is there streaming going on?
<otakon> enope
<Placebo> Garrus + Tali tech overuse.
<MahBoi777> I dun think so
<MasterBrony> I GOT IT
<kirzstryfe> 1,3well, depending on the time difference
<Ingwaz> well, a good solid biotic can usually take care of themselves, might take awhile, but we've got enough crowd control and firepower
<kirzstryfe> 1,3they may not have evolved yet
<MasterBrony> they had wings like rarity did from Twi's spell
<otakon> Ingwaz: unless you've got a dozen guys bearing down on your position from multiple angles
<MasterBrony> the residual magic
<Ingwaz> i've never done a playthrough of soldier, just doesnt feel right
<PonyFlare> Hmm...
<otakon> AND those damn mechs
<MasterBrony> must have altered raritys DNA
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol
<Placebo> Overload
<MasterBrony> and when she reproduced
<Placebo> nuff said
<Midnight_Tempest> heavy mechs...
<MasterBrony> the Flutterponies where born
<ValtheJean> 2,14 mechs are the best things ever
<PonyFlare> lol
<MasterBrony> im
<otakon> Placebo: more than one guy, nuff said
<MasterBrony> a
<Ingwaz> otakon, thats what careful placement of singularity, throws, shockwaves and pulls are for along with heavy smg supressing fire
*MahBoi777 wonders what's for dinner
<ValtheJean> 2,14 hit them in the head, mini-nuke to clear out the room
<Placebo> Overload. Incendinary rounds.
*LadyCanary loves her Deathscythe <3
<PonyFlare> Ooops?
<otakon> Ingwaz: SHIELDS!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3she's a unicorn, she's more likely to have absorbed any residual and used it in a future spell
<kirzstryfe> 1,3lol, das boot
<MasterBrony> #pinkie_pie
<Ingwaz> thats what the smg is for
<Simon2> MahBoi777: Mah Boi
<kirzstryfe> 1,3she's a unicorn, she's more likely to have absorbed any residual and used it in a future spell
<MasterBrony> damn it
<otakon> ValtheJean: did that, so much fun
<MahBoi777> LOL
<SaxyPretender> 0,14like Gundam Deathscythe?
<MasterBrony> what i miss?
<PonyFlare> That
<Placebo> ^
<kirzstryfe> 1,3that was it
<Ingwaz> smg takes down shields and does so very effectively, powers then become available
<Placebo> Suddenly, Gundam Wing theme
<MasterBrony> got kicked for speed typing
<otakon> but when you pop your head out and get shot 10 times in a second it doesn't matter
<otakon> I've done tests
<MasterBrony> and that is a valid point
<PonyFlare> Lol. Just type it all on one line rather than multiple lines
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: yeah, smg's are really good at bringing sheilds down
<kirzstryfe> 1,3more likely, the same type of magic was used on dissatisfied earth/unicorn ponies that wanted to fly
<Ingwaz> dunno what to tell you otakon, i didnt have much trouble with it and it was at least on veteran, possibly hardcore
<LadyCanary> Yes indeed SaxyPretender.
<otakon> 1 guy can shred 1000 points of shielding in3 seconds
<Phase4> who's here because of MasterBrony ?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Niiiiiiiice.
<otakon> 1 guy
<Placebo> So are a soldiers Cryo rounds
<MasterBrony> me
<otakon> kills you
<otakon> in
<Placebo> Wait, cryo? What are they called...
<otakon> 3 seconds
<kirzstryfe> 1,3we're discussing Equestrian history and evolution
<LadyCanary> When my friend played one of the super robot taizen games, Deathscythes ultimate was HNNNNG
<Ingwaz> otakon, bonus power, get barrier and pump it all the way up
<MahBoi777> 10 seconds flat
<otakon> Ingwaz: THAT WAS WITH BARRIER
<Ingwaz> barrier is the adepts best friend
<Placebo> Geth Shield boost?
<Phase4> neat, i had one like that a while ago
<otakon> bc that's the ONLY way to get your shields that high
<Midnight_Tempest> i dont think so otakon... i made it to the last wave before getting killed, on hardcore
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: class
<Ingwaz> perhaps you're thinking on insanity otakon
<Midnight_Tempest> soldier
<otakon> also, I did too
<Shizuka> 13wer ist playing mass effect
<MasterBrony> i wonder when the ponies will discover that people are real?
<otakon> but it took me a couple of tries
<kirzstryfe> 1,3if g1 is far enough away from g4 in the timeline, after Celestia/Luna disappeared and the ponies were left to evolve on their own, that could explain the rise of flutter/sea ponies
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and magic could have caused or sped up the process

<MasterBrony> did you notice the sublimal message the celestia has no friends?
*TOY_PON3 comes back all neat and with monocle on
<kirzstryfe> 1,3one reason I really respect the show as it is now, gives a lot more respect to girls then many, many previous shows

<MasterBrony> through the power of friendship
<TOY_PON3> Vi it's nice to have you back ಠ_ರೃ
<LadyCanary> No need to apologize my dear!!!
*Rain hugs LadyCanary
<LadyCanary> It's perfectly understandable.
<LadyCanary> Rain <3
<MasterBrony> Luna and celestia used them once to trap discord
<kirzstryfe> 1,3immortality usually hurts the immortal, especially if they've made friends before
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Oh hai Rain
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I'd hate to live forever
<Rain> so, whats going on?
<MasterBrony> if i was married to princess luna, i could deal with immortality

<VioletVanilla> 06nice to see you all as well
<Rain> what is wrong with VioletVanilla? >_>
<MasterBrony> celestia trapped discoed once
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Celestia had Luna with her to rule Equestria, but had to banish her
*Rain hugs VioletVanilla
<otakon> Rain: she's ill, like me
<MahBoi777> hi VioletVanilla
<Rain> that sucks :<
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Everybody gotta get better ;_____;
<otakon> it does
<MasterBrony> what was stopping her from doing it again?
<otakon> trying
<MasterBrony> as a side note
<otakon> but the weather is not helping
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> SaxyPretender: Indeed ಠ_ರೃ
<MasterBrony> luna WAS back when discord showed up
<LadyCanary> So fancy.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3*long text mode*...
<Ingwaz> quite
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> ;)
<MahBoi777> Such class
<otakon> indeed

*MasterBrony waits.....

<VioletVanilla> 06it opens up massive. .
*LadyCanary giggles
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Yoshi?
<otakon> VioletVanilla: it's not that cold here, but the weather has been so variable hay fever has spread early
<MahBoi777> I dare say that's rather chilly
*TOY_PON3|Fancy nods
<kirzstryfe> 1,3when Celestia had to banish Luna as Nightmare Moon, that would've broken their connection with the EoH, which was noted that's how they defeated him before, and the EoH found new hosts in the mane 6
<otakon> Coughing, sneezing, hacking, headache, body ache....
<otakon> argh
<otakon> I feel like crap
<SaxyPretender> 0,14;n;

<LadyCanary> D:
*LadyCanary is sad.

<otakon> I'm trying
<GabeMoist> Gentlemen
<SaxyPretender> 0,14That goes for everyoooooooooooooone
<MasterBrony> AH-HA!!! a valid point appears.....
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> VioletVanilla: I apologize for my sudden laugh :(
<kirzstryfe> 1,3since the EoH were with new hosts, Celestia wouldn't have been able to call upon them 1: without Luna at full strength, and 2: without harming the mane 6
<otakon> been drinking lots of water and taking medicine
<otakon> VioletVanilla: have you been to the doctor dear?
<LadyCanary> Good good.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe, had this part of the discussion back when s2 started
<MahBoi777> ┌─┐
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Let my burning spirit guide you to recovery!
<MahBoi777> ┴─┴
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also oh hai GabeMoist
<otakon> nice try MahBoi777
<GabeMoist> Ohai Saxy
*Rainbowjack curls up and falls asleep
<otakon> hiya GabeMoist
<MasterBrony> ok, as a curious question.....what good was it doing to have celestia keep hold of them?
*TOY_PON3|Fancy feels bad but sees money and smiles
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> :)
<Noir> Is eny one else seeing a black screen?
<MahBoi777> otakon: LOL all I need is a tophat!
<MasterBrony> thats a very good point btw
<GabeMoist> I feel like I arrived shortly after disaster has fallen upon Bronystate
*otakon puts a blanket on Rainbowjack
<SaxyPretender> 0,14no stream atm, Noir
<Rainbowjack> no streaming
<otakon> hi Noir!
<Noir> Ah
<otakon> long time no see
<Noir> Hey
<Phase4> we got to about the same point when i was talking with some other guys about this
*Rainbowjack smiles and cuddels the blanket
<kirzstryfe> 1,3keep them from losing them probably, and they're supposedly a myth/secret and very important to Equestria
*TOY_PON3|Fancy gives money to stream but it won't show anything
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> Hmmmm...
<Ingwaz> its not a stripper TOY_PON3|Fancy
<otakon> try yelling at it!
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> Want more money stream? ಠ_ರೃ
<otakon> or punch it!
<Phase4> different reasoning though, we were focousing on the timeline of luna/celestias apearence and when discord showed up
*VioletVanilla does . .
<otakon> OOH!
<kirzstryfe> 1,3pretty sure RBD would leave it lying around, Pinkie would probably lose it, and Rarity would be showing it off with anything she could
<MasterBrony> well, she didnt do a very good job, as discord got them
<otakon> or trying yelling AND punching it!
<Dumori> try eating it to steal it's power
<otakon> um
*TOY_PON3|Fancy gives VioletVanilla check for 100,000,000 dollars
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> There ;)
<Phase4> well discord is Q
<MahBoi777> I say sir, are you implying that the chat is a harlot?
<otakon> that'll just give him indigestion
<otakon> indeed
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> maybe you will get better soon
<otakon> That's a bit rich
<Phase4> its not fair to expect her to survive against Q
<MasterBrony> q is John deLancie
<PonyFlare> What I wonder is if Luna & Celestia had another 4 ponies on their team when they used the Elements
<otakon> brb need a drink
<kirzstryfe> 1,3god of chaoes, since Luna was (theoretically) still recovering, she may not have been able to act against him
<otakon> and some advil
<MasterBrony> from waht i understand
*TOY_PON3|Fancy invests in ponies so became rich
<MasterBrony> is they did not
*Rainbowjack snugels the blanket
<kirzstryfe> 1,3they've yet to be mentioned at least
<TOY_PON3|Fancy> invested*
<MahBoi777> you shall become wealthy
<MasterBrony> maybe luna and celestia have other Bro/sis ponies
<MasterBrony> 0.0
<PonyFlare> Maybe
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and if the 2 goddesses had to work together to stop Discord, if he caught Luna unawares right after his escape she may not have been able to do anything
<MahBoi777> so
*TOY_PON3|Fancy gives MahBoi777 book, "How To Invest in Ponies by Fancy Pants" There you go chap ಠ_ರೃ
<Phase4> theres something about a candence who is suposedly going to apear, its all rumors from what i know
<MasterBrony> i just want luna to have more air time
<MahBoi777> a good read indeed!
<Phase4> ^
<kirzstryfe> 1,3Princess Cadence
<PonyFlare> Heh
<MasterBrony> he showed up and made friends
<Phase4> did i spell that right kirzstryfe ?
<MasterBrony> then dissapeared, never to be seen again
<kirzstryfe> 1,3rumors are something about a wedding, if you go by the playset info that has come out
<Phase4> MasterBrony: he?

*MahBoi777 gives Derpy ALL the muffinz
<Dashie_Dashie> I know SuperBrony64 is lurking... somewhere.
<TOY_PON3> I was too distracted by chat to understand it
<TOY_PON3> :(
<Dumorimasoddaa> Then I'm gonna read a book and drink my coco with cream and marshmallows.
<MahBoi777> watching, waiting, windling weaving....
<Dumorimasoddaa> I discovered coco is my pro get to sleep drink
<Dumorimasoddaa> This fact could be life changing
<Placebo> So.. can I put my cloths back on now?
<MahBoi777> life changing!
<MahBoi777> ............
<Placebo> ^
<Polydunami> Please don't take away Derpy :'(
<Dken2021> well it wasn't about derpy, but it was mostly how hasbro feels about us
<MahBoi777> do they like us? LOL
<TOY_PON3> DerpyHooves` is here to stay! :3
<Dashie_Dashie> uhh.. yeah.
*Midnight_Tempest splashes Placebo with ice water 'thats for blowing me up'
<Ingwaz> of course they like us? why wouldnt they?
<Dashie_Dashie> Hasbro wubs us <3
*DerpyHooves` taesk all muffinz happily
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Ingwaz> we're a heavily expanded user base with money
*Placebo shivers
<MahBoi777> just askin, lol
<Dashie_Dashie> Bronies have a major effect on the show.
<Dumorimasoddaa> I have an interment phobia of sleep
*Placebo Turns Midnight_Tempest into a rug again, uses it as a blanket
<Dashie_Dashie> so many references we get, they make.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Something that removes it will make my life much better
<Midnight_Tempest> o.o
<TOY_PON3> Without Bronies I believe the show will already be cancelled
<MahBoi777> such a good community
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
*Midnight_Tempest smoothers Placebo as a rug
<Placebo> Silly filly, Placebo's doen't need oxygen
<Dashie_Dashie> We also give hasbro and the writers ideas to use in their episodes, together with the community and hasbro we can keep this show alive for 5+ seasons.
<TOY_PON3> ^
<MahBoi777> big effect
<Midnight_Tempest> that would be awesome
<TOY_PON3> It will happen
<Dashie_Dashie> if it happens MLD was right.
<Placebo> I think the killer is going to be lack of material.
<Dashie_Dashie> also, ponies exist.
<Dashie_Dashie> :>
<Dken2021> whoa, 5+ seasons? that's probably more seasons a girl-geared show wishes to get to
<Dumorimasoddaa> Well s3 is 50% length
*Midnight_Tempest turns back to normal and jumps up and down on Placebo
<Placebo> Ow. ow. ow. o-ow. ow

<Thunderpony> Digimon xros
<PinkiePie101> oh
<moop> RAINBOOM?
<PinkiePie101> dat rainbow ring
<Thunderpony> Funny thing about this is it's the most violent and burtal out of all the other digimon seasons
<PinkiePie101> "art is explosion!" what the fuck
<NewDCD> 09,01Digimon Xros Wars
<Thunderpony> Naruto reference
<Starflash> Dat obvious reference
<HeavyMetalDash> sounds METAL
<NewDCD> 09,01and it's awesome
<GiantLawnchair> Weeaboo digimons and stuff.
<PinkiePie101> ^
<NewDCD> 09,01this is my favorite Digimon series so far
<NewDCD> 09,01because
<moop> FOS DO RAH!\
<PinkiePie101> Holy/....
<Thunderpony> Weaboo means a person trying to immitate japanese culture...
<GiantLawnchair> Wasn't Beezlebub a devil or something?
<Thunderpony> Yeah
<moop> i dont like weeboo
<PinkiePie101> Same
<Thunderpony> Beelzebumon is suppose to be a demon like digimon
<NewDCD> 09,01it's Digimon (my childhood) fused with HOT BLOOD, GUTS, GIANT ROBOT TROPES, HOT BLOOD, COURAGE, AWESOME, HOT BLOOD, AND DID I MENTION HOT BLOOD?
<Thunderpony> Like devimon and lucemon obvious plays off devil and lucifer
<HeavyMetalDash> metal
<moop> i wish i was a drum
<PinkiePie101> fuck you ads
<GiantLawnchair> It's an anime, gotta have floating islands.
<HeavyMetalDash> lol I have like six thousand digimon cards from back in the day
<PinkiePie101> WISH UPON A STAR
<GiantLawnchair> Ha ha, oh wow.
<moop> he said Die Hore!
<Thunderpony> OH hell no
<moop> whore
<Thunderpony> What the crap is lucemon doing here?
<Thunderpony> Wasn't he the digimon that devoured the digital world a few seasons back?
<NewDCD> 09,01XRos Wars is an alternate world
<Thunderpony> That would explain it
<moop> is digimon still around?
<NewDCD> 09,01apparently Tai from S1 appears in XRos Wars: The Boy Hunters that Jump Through Time
<Thunderpony> So it's set in the first seasons world?
<NewDCD> 09,01not as a regular character, but Digimon has had alternate-world-traveling-shenanigans since S02
<HeavyMetalDash> Tai is still around thaT G1 gangsta!
<PinkiePie101> lol.
<Thunderpony> True dat
<NewDCD> 09,01yeah but this isn't the same Digital World as any of the other series
<Thunderpony> That would explain why lucemon isn't a dick and planning to blow the frack out of the human world
<RawketLawnchair> Time travel 'n' stuff.
<NewDCD> 09,01Taichi is the one that went through them worlds and stuff
<Thunderpony> Shakkoumon. I didn't like him as the DNA digivolution
<NewDCD> 09,01also I love the role of humans in this show
<Thunderpony> You mean the fact they have a role?
<NewDCD> 09,01the only one who actually does something is Taiki, who is their "General"....basically a Tactician
<PinkiePie101> I'm gonna go npw
<PinkiePie101> now*
<PinkiePie101> Cya later everypony
<moop> bye pinkiepie101

<moop> holy shot
<NewDCD> 09,01the other two humans are here by accident...but the other boy is a badass, going to BATTLE with the other digimans as well
<Thunderpony> I remember when shoutmon got stabbed in the stomach
<NewDCD> 09,01Zenigata Tsoujirou
<RawketLawnchair> You should have paid the fine.
<Thunderpony> I was like "Whaaat?! They allowed that?!"
<RawketLawnchair> Hmmm. Mmmm. It keeps skipping for me.
<HeavyMetalDash> I remember when wizardmon died
<HeavyMetalDash> I was all like "nuuuuuuuuuuu"
<Thunderpony> Wizardmon, i don't remember seeing him in any series
<Thunderpony> Any other*
<HeavyMetalDash> I think it might be an outdated season final of season 1 don't quote me on that though
<HeavyMetalDash> I have not kept up on digimon over the years
<moop> au revoir everypony
<HeavyMetalDash> bye moop
<Thunderpony> What a epic law system

<Kammerjunk> I prefer both.
<Simon> who's streaming?
<otakon> hiya Simon!
<otakon> Simon: guess
<deadhoar5> sumi.i.think
<Queen_Rarity> @ot: that would be a first
<diddutz> cuz I never heared about "The new seasson of Mythbusters!!"
<Kammerjunk> DJ-P0N3 would be a stage name.
<otakon> deadhoar5: why.all.the.periods.?
<Simon> Mythbusters? Watched it up to Season 9
<Jim> otakon: Also relevant: http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_losp57dW0C1qha245o1_500.png
<ScootalooWonderloo> techincally that is her name... its sad :(
<deadhoar5> spacebar.broken.otakon
<ScootalooWonderloo> Vinyl Scratch is better
<Simon> lol deadhoar5
<otakon> that.sucks.
<deadhoar5> get.it.simon?
<RawketLawnchair> otakon. . .get a hold of yourself.
<Simon> does anyone got a problem where the server disconnects whenever it's 12:00am?
<otakon> never.I.am.ALWAYS.out.of.touch!
<Sumica> 00,10I would say use the tab key instead but that could be intersting with auto compleat
<deadhoar5> .no
<deadhoar5> wait,what?
<deadhoar5> tab.key.for.what?
<Jim> tab key autofills the rest of a nick
<Simon> (type) dead (then) <tab> (result) deadhoar5

<Fazana> Seening paips
<deadhoar5> deadhoar5: yesh
<deadhoar5> otakon: yesh
<Sumica> 00,10tab key is normaly used for inserting 5 spaces at once in a text field
<otakon> ALSO! Is ANYONE interested that Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning comes out?
<Simon> I've been using too much tab lately

<deadhoar5> ?
<ScootalooWonderloo> Sumica: so this is the first season of mythbusters?
<deadhoar5> Queen_Rarity: explain
<Krakass> I wouldn't recommend pouring soda on it. That does not help.
<Stallion_of_War> Dead - use a hammer
<Sumica> 00,10yep ScootalooWonderloo
<Krakass> Trust me.
<ScootalooWonderloo> Sumica: cool
<Stallion_of_War> If a hammer helps fly the TARDIS, it should fix your keyboard
<Simon> Am I missing an eyebrow?
<Queen_Rarity> take it appart
<deadhoar5> Krakass: no.crap
<deadhoar5> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L20Zs7_NIc&feature=related
<Stallion_of_War> You mean soda doesn't help fix electronics? :O
<Simon> soda + mentos!
<Krakass> Rubbing alcohol or something else the evaporates readily may help.
<Queen_Rarity> test the button, if it doesn't respond you need a new keyboard
<ScootalooWonderloo> who was streaming the japanese powerrangers yesterday?
<deadhoar5> might.start.doing.some.Vinyl.Scrathc.drawings.soon
<KetaminaDianePie> you can use Ctrl+V
<Queen_Rarity> ^

<diddutz> A fried of mine believes he fixed his graphics card by putting in in his oven and backing it for 10-15 minutes at 150°C

<Jim> People go to space, do stuff, that's what there's to know
<moop> I have only seen the original series the animated show and the next gen but never seen this
<Randomnerd> Star Trek is "Wagon Train to the Stars"
<Tao-mell> best Star Trek series so far
<Tovler> I never did see Enterprise
<Tao-mell> Tom Paris is a STUD
<moop> Why does evey one exept me like the original series?
<Starflash> whoa
<Sumica> 00,10enterprise was disapointing due to time travle and re-writeing canon
<otakon> Um
<Starflash> who's streaming this?
<Tao-mell> it's okay, moop
<otakon> is this a D&D ep?
<Tao-mell> I hate the original series too
<otakon> REALLY?

<Sumica> 00,10borg ponies would destroy us all. /billy

*Simon is kind of sleepy, but he continues to stay up
<KetaminaDianePie> Star Trek: Feminism is Magic
<derpy_pony> there rarely was a direct interaction...the trade took a lot of stations
<Rainbowjack> Star Trek : DATA!!!
<Randomnerd> Had they claimed to be from another contienet, they'd have bought their foreign appearance
<derpy_pony> probably
<derpy_pony> the language would have been the worst problem...telling them the necessary stuff before being jailed or killed on the spor
<derpy_pony> spot
<Simon> matrix...
<KetaminaDianePie> dejavooo......
<Rainbowjack> that like us Bronies everone hates us just to hate on us

<Fazana> It's like barriers

<Fazana> It's the same
<GLaDOS> Heh?

<GLaDOS> Where am I?
<MirrorImage> Fazana - Indy 500 really doesn't apply

<otakon> my god the SMOKE
<Fazana> That's usual
<MirrorImage> otakon - yes, nothing like contributing to the polution in the general vicinity
<Fazana> You should see the amount of smoke from an engine failure
<moop> diddutz: thanks
<Jim> What's this?
<Dashie_Dashie> This is pure awesomeness
<Midnight_Tempest> to do a drift... on an incline like that is madness
<otakon> THIS IS INSANE!
<MirrorImage> Jim - Car Porn, lets leave it at that
<RawketLawnchair> This is the first prototype TransAM.
<Fazana> Sometimes, there's bagger all, but sometimes, the place is flooded with smoke
<Midnight_Tempest> sparks
<otakon> how the FUCK?
<Jim> Oh gawd
<Jim> Spinning
<Midnight_Tempest> his tires are dead
<MirrorImage> otakon - 4 wheel drive helps
<KetaminaDianePie> :O?
<MirrorImage> ALOT
<Dashie_Dashie> his back tires are gone.

<otakon> I need a pic of my face
<Sumica> 00,10dead camera
<diddutz> red glowing breaks ...
<otakon> I can't lift my jaw
<otakon> THAT is waht we should be watching instead of Nascar!
<MirrorImage> otakon - nah, combine the two
<Midnight_Tempest> your jaw is now the floor otakon
<Jim> Ohai tetris theme
<MirrorImage> 43 guys doing this AT ONCE
<Fazana> Nascar = cars driving in ovals
<otakon> MirrorImage: my god
<moop> 1912
<Midnight_Tempest> nascar is just a waste of gas
<KetaminaDianePie> this stream is degenerating soo much.............................
<RawketLawnchair> Well, I gotta do some homework now.
<Jim> MirrorImage: That might just be crazy enough to work
<RawketLawnchair> Unot momento.
<Fazana> I'm thinking about watching Indycar
<moop> 1917
<Fazana> as Boobens Barrichello has joined the parp-tay
<KetaminaDianePie> :O?
<otakon> Sumica: that was the most awesome thing I've seen recently
<moop> TETRIS!
<KetaminaDianePie> wtf hahahahahahahahahahaa
<MirrorImage> though full disclosure, i enjoy NASCAR as is
<otakon> MirrorImage: NASCAR has NOTHING on what we saw just now.
<MirrorImage> agreed, but you can't do Gymkhana for that long
<MirrorImage> NASCAR is more about consistency and speed than it is over pure performance
<MirrorImage> (at least it is now adays)
<Fazana> I must be honest, I fail to see how 40 odd cars racing in circles is intresting
<moop> im a Czar
<Midnight_Tempest> nascar needs to be put out of its misery... its so boring and needs MOAR DRIFTING!
<Jim> Der Führer is dead, the world is now red.
<MirrorImage> Fazana - eh... it's a redneck thing
<Jim> Too early :O
<MirrorImage> remember, NASCAR was born from people running Moonshine back in the prohibition era
<moop> this is like the russian revolution
<Dken2021> lali-ho everypony
<Jim> ohai Dken2021
<Fazana> If it had some actual turns, like F1 or something, it would make it about 5 times more intresting
<Dashie_Dashie> if you want to see some drifting just watch the x-games this year.
<Sumica> 00,10There are nasscar road tracks
<MirrorImage> Fazana - again, NASCAR is about speed rather than performance
<Dashie_Dashie> ^
<unfoundbug> but they dont go that fast
<MirrorImage> it's not about turning necessarily, it's about "ok, how fast can i get this car to go before i peg the rev limiter?"
<derpy_pony> Ken Block Gymkhana is not available due to copyright bla...
<Jim> Spaaaace
<Sumica> 00,10that sucks derpy_pony

<Dken2021> moop, let me be the first to say, cute pic
<alexxm> hi yellow
<otakon> bc I react usually
*Lasharus slaps Midnight_Tempest
<otakon> and my messages are short
<ScootaChicken> Jesus Christ this video is epic
*Midnight_Tempest kicks Lasharus >_<
<alexxm> beat u to it dken
<otakon> I've been kicked 80+ times by daribot
*Lasharus smacks Midnight_Tempest upside the head. Stop fighting back, you deserved that slap.
<otakon> over the course of 3 months
<Jim> I know this..

<Jim> Oh portal
<ScootaChicken> oh my god Want You Gone
<moop> Dken2021: u can the picture is so well drawn you can see the butterfly in her eye's reflection
*Midnight_Tempest whacks Lasharus with a newspaper. Nevah!
<ScootaChicken> I love this man
<otakon> and apparently have over 60K posts since I joined
<Rainbowjack> PORTAL!!!
<Lasharus> Ow.

<Midnight_Tempest> minecraft has a kind of 'ending' but in the end its still a sandbox game... no true ending
<PartyCannon> Sumica I could feel the heat from that burn :3
<Jim> But still, if you defeat it, you continue playing
