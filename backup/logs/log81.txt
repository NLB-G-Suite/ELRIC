<NewDCD> 9so if you prefer dub or sub, just tell me
<FallSilently> But then, I can rhyme most anything, as long as I'm not asked to sing.

<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13;w;

<StephenCawking> Your rhyming I despise
<Roara|Touhou> 6on the run I beat remilia, I actually completely missed the life block on 5th stage
<StephenCawking> it brings tears to mine eyes
<Roara|Touhou> 6and basically cried when I saw it vanish off screen
<IceMane> I have to go, and don't say no.
<Dermathil> what's that?
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13LOL wow
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13of all the things you had to miss

<IceMane> For I'll be back! Just don't follow my track.
<Roara|Touhou> 6if I had that life, I wuoldn't have had to bomb so many times in remilia's fight
<NewDCD> 9also I can switch to Dub or Sub in your preference
<Roara|Touhou> 6I feel like technically I didn't beat her, since I bombed like crazy on her last spell
<DesertRose> i chose to say: doorbell
<prince-dari> From my experience I prefer sub.
<Dermathil> why?
<Roara|Touhou> 6I probably could have done it, but I wanted to 1cc so badly I just went LOLXXXXXXXXX
<NewDCD> 9YOU UNDASTAN
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13By the way, do you have a replay of the run where you beat Remilia?
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13I wanna see it :D
<Manearion> I'm listening!
<Roara|Touhou> 6yeah I'll show you sometime
<Crainy> i cant ryhme
<FallSilently> What is Celestia Radio? I must confess I do not know. If you could just provide a link, I'll have a look and see, I think.
<Crainy> so i wont even try
<Blums> Your rhymes are as smooth as a bucket of bricks
<prince-dari> I had a look at an anime both with the original Japanese and then with English subbed.
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'll be back with my computer on saturday or sunday
<Roara|Touhou> 6and I'll show you
<Blums> And all in the same scheme aswell
<drfsupercenter> 03sigh
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13and I'll get to see how you play it as well, which I'm always interested in~
<Angel_Espy|Touhou> 13Awesome :D
<Blums> Why not try a different pattern for kicks
<prince-dari> The voices just sounded annoying and didn't seem to fit as well.
<drfsupercenter> 03I have this png that somehow got corrupted
<BlacklightShining> http://ponify.me/
<Manearion> I just tuned in!
<Blums> Variety is sure to sell
<DesertRose> MY BRAAIIN YOUR MELTING MY BRAIN
<drfsupercenter> 03anyone have any idea how to open what's left of it?
<NewDCD> 9some dubs ARE good
<prince-dari> I prefered the Japanese.
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm downloading MoF right now since as easy as it is....it's one of the most difficult for me
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<NewDCD> 9it's just that many are pretty bad
<ValtheJean> yeah, unfortunately it's REALLY hard to be a good anime VA
<prince-dari> Meh.
<Roara|Touhou> 6not really
<Dermathil> example: TTGL dub is awesome.
<drfsupercenter> 03:/
<Roara|Touhou> 6I've never seen a png be successfully recovered
<CogWeaver> is the melted fluid going down the drain?
<ValtheJean> IS GODZIRRA
<drfsupercenter> 03frick
<ELT> If your brain is melting you better head over to thhe freezer
<Manearion> Ok everypony TUNE. IN!
<NewDCD> 9yeah. It's mainly because of the nature of the Japanese Language
<NewDCD> 9it's difficult to dub
<drfsupercenter> 03why does my phone's memory card have to randomly corrupt thigns x.x
<Roara|Touhou> 6how corrupted is it
<ValtheJean> yeah
<prince-dari> RUBBAH DUCK ZIRRA
<Dermathil> yeah.
<drfsupercenter> 03bad enough that it says
<drfsupercenter> 03"Windows Photo Viewer can't open this picture because the file appears to be damaged, corrupted, or too large"
<ValtheJean> which is why I think people should go away from trying to lip synch it
<Dermathil> But TTGL's dub is top-notch though
<drfsupercenter> 03and nothing I tried will work
<drfsupercenter> 03Adobe Fireworks fails
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm assuming the "too large" isnt the problem?
<ValtheJean> I mean, just get a stronger translation, don't worry about the animation, you know?
<NewDCD> 9TTGL's dub is okay
<drfsupercenter> 03nopr
<drfsupercenter> 03*nmope
<drfsupercenter> 03*NOPE
<NewDCD> 9I've seen much better
<Roara|Touhou> 6lol
<drfsupercenter> 03Windows Photo Gallery says corrupted
<ValtheJean> if worse comes to worse, you can always edit the existing animation
<Roara|Touhou> 6can you send me the file maybe?
<FallSilently> I've never seen a thing like this. He speaks of queries... What'd I kiss?
<Jason> http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loupw3YWGF1qjql2lo1_500.jpg
<Jason> lol
<FallSilently> miss*
<Crainy> Celestia Radio?
<NewDCD> 9many people HATE the GL's dub and frankly it doesn't deserve all the hate it gets
<StephenCawking> if more people tune in, the DJ will apparently do something
<Crainy> are you serious???
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah maybe
<drfsupercenter> 03let me try something first
<NewDCD> 9Dai-Guard's summary: Alternate Universe Apollo Justice pilots a mech.
<Dermathil> they think Kamina's voice lost part of its crazy in the dub.
<DesertRose> You know what the most awesome password is?
<drfsupercenter> 03...

<DesertRose> wierd thing is ive been using the same 4 passwords for the past 5 years and not one of them has been hacked/guessed

<drfsupercenter> 03hm
<Dermathil> Et tu, Bruti? (You too, Brutus? from Julius Caesar by Shakespeare)
<Crainy> mhpf
<drfsupercenter> 03Aurora, does this look like the same Art Institute you said is good?
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/0g3MB.png
<Manearion> Considering the sparse material they have presented, the lack of a website and the fact that they have no budget!
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm seeing "AiPrograms.info" and it looks incredibly sketchy
<Roara|Touhou> 6thats it
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf
<FallSilently> What did he say he'd do when he gets 200 listeners?
<drfsupercenter> 03they don't have a .edu?
<MrPoniator> Also, you'd better not hurry a fighting game
<Manearion> Nope!
<Roara|Touhou> 6I recognize the locations and the logo

<drfsupercenter> 03then why the frick is that commercial so sketchy looking
<Roara|Touhou> 6each individual school treats itaself as such
<Roara|Touhou> 6there's no ai.edu
<drfsupercenter> 03ah
*DesertRose Somehow poked his eye when doing up his zipper/fly
<Darkside> hehe, the server url for celestia radio is molestia.ponify.me

<SirSprinkles> 6=/
<The_Crowing> and winter wrap up
<Darkside> The_Crowing: more like a remix
<FallSilently> It's a sledghammering of the theme song
<Roara|Touhou> 6yep
<Manearion> Gay R-D?
<Crainy> yeah, nice remix
<The_Crowing> but what does it have to do with rainbow dash being gay?
<SirSprinkles> 6It's really incredibly easy, but I have to leave for work NOW.
<drfsupercenter> 03then again, music is the same way
<Roara|Touhou> 6I honestly hate it, considering there ARE normal people there
<Darkside> nothing
<Manearion> Please stp that communit..
<Lakorv> gah.
<drfsupercenter> 03some people make it big, but most end up living in a garage somewhere LOL
<Crainy> how can rainbowdash be gay?
<Roara|Touhou> 6but that's also half the reason I'm not going to a true art school
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm going to a university with a pro art program
<Dermathil> if you gotta leave now, then hurry.

<Crainy> oh ponys
<Steven_Magnet> Has Sathi got VAC yet?
<The_Crowing> Oh god, the zebra episode
<Manearion> But I think it'd be more interesting if Rarity found out she was gay!
<The_Crowing> Ponys are RACIST!
<drfsupercenter> 03OK so
<NewDCD> 9don't know if she got the correct one
<Glacymr> 12guess it's not the same thing

<Manearion> Yes but they learn....
<The_Crowing> i know
<Crainy> i mean

<The_Crowing> Crainy chill out
<Sathi> yer i'm sure someone can help me on another version?
<Crainy> Zecora or whatever shes called isnt a stereotypew
<Unidentified29933> I have the urge to troll some of those radio stations with a trololo rendition of Duel of the Fates
<Crainy> wasnt that the whole point of the entire episode?!
<FallSilently> Obviously we still like the show, Crainy.
<Crainy> to accept whats different?
<Unidentified29933> I don't know why I have this urge.
<abirkin2> SIEG ZEON!
<NewDCD> 9BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
<Dermathil> >mfw my keyboard don't even type the same things whether I type in in mibbit or in Steam
<Dermathil> BA BA BABABABABA
<prince-dari> You need to make a VAC in the control panel
<Darkside> ok what the hell is this
<Crainy> i mean
<StephenCawking> Crainy: She lives in a mudhut and collects masks, which part of that is not stereotypical?
<NewDCD> 9Best fucking song
<abirkin2> darkside: hmm?
<Darkside> Pinkies Cocaine Party?
<The_Crowing> ....what is this?
<BlacklightShining> …what is this I don't even
<Crainy> everything can be a stereotype
<FallSilently> Peculiar.
<Crainy> but thats not what counts
<Dermathil> NewDCD, it is, after Sorairo Days and ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH
<StephenCawking> uhh no
<Darkside> very peculiar
<The_Crowing> this isnt even a song
<Crainy> what counts if it is portrayed as something bad
<Darkside> i'm not that excited about this track
<StephenCawking> only stereotypes can be stereotypes
<Manearion> Zecora is stereotypical yes! I hope they develop her more in season 2!
<Dermathil> I SAW SPEAR-ARM
<Manearion> I really do!
<BlacklightShining> O_o
<BlacklightShining> o_O
<FallSilently> Does this radio ever play normal music?
<Crainy> mhpf
<mib_1k85go> Hi!:D
<Darkside> FallSilently: i doubt it
<mib_1k85go> Wait..
<FallSilently> Or is it all crazy stuff like the last four songs?
<Darkside> haha
<StephenCawking> he plays everything
<SillyNilly> I unmuted the music and all I hear is a random bumble of noise.
<BlacklightShining> normal music?
<Manearion> Brony music IS crazy!
<BlacklightShining> lol
<Darkside> YES
<SillyNilly> Back to 8-bit!
<Crainy> today, everything seems to be racist and whatnot
<FallSilently> More 8-Bit :) Must be tonnes of it.
<Dermathil> trololol
<CogWeaver> Fall: It's always oatmeal, 25/8
<The_Crowing> I <3 the 8 bit theme song
<BlacklightShining> …maybe a bit TOO much eight bit
<Dakota> Hi!
<Crainy> less 8 bit, more ponybeat
<BlacklightShining> ^
<drfsupercenter> 03someone hasn't heard of /nick >_>
<Crainy> also
<Darkside> i admit, i do like the renard mix of this track
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/XNdXt.png <- yay movies that don't attempt to hide commercial operatying systems? XD
<Crainy> what kind of stereotype is Zacora?!
<NewDCD> 9LOL
<Dermathil> MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH

<prince-dari> AHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Dermathil> Evil laugh at work
<Crainy> nice stereotype there, guys
<prince-dari> AHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA
<FallSilently> This is not a good version of Giggle.
<Paul_McColtney> She's african steretype
<Darkside> http://lapfox.bandcamp.com/track/got-my-pony-spam-for-you
<Crainy> says who?
<Manearion> The Zecora incident is about not being racist, so it's not racist, but it's still EXTREMELLY stereotypical...
<Paul_McColtney> stereotype
<BlacklightShining> At the Winter Gala?
<prince-dari> Sathi, open up the VAC control panel
<StephenCawking> Crainy: http://www.healthanddna.com/ancestry-dna-testing/african-ancestry_clip_image002.jpg

<StephenCawking> okay hold on

<BlacklightShining> O_o
<BlacklightShining> o_O

<Roara|Touhou> 6dakota
<Roara|Touhou> 6when you want to change your name
<Crainy> i know
<StephenCawking> AFRICAAAA
<Crainy> but shes still a zebra
<Roara|Touhou> 6just type /nick yournamehere
<NewDCD> 9dat mood whiplash
<BlacklightShining> :/
<StephenCawking> an anthropomorphic zebra
<Dakota> okay
<Roara|Touhou> 6obviously filling yournamehere with the name you want
<Darkside> hrmm, not the biggest fan of this mix
<StephenCawking> used as a hamfisted metaphor for an african
<Roara|Touhou> 6it makes it way more convenient
<The_Crowing> that collects masks
<The_Crowing> and lives in a hut
<Crainy> the show never told you that
<The_Crowing> and brews potions
<Dakota> thanks!:)
<Dermathil> dem idiots blocking the roads with cars
<BlacklightShining> …well…
<Crainy> that was your interpretation
*Darkside listens to some pony spam
<StephenCawking> and speaks in rhyme
<Manearion> Well, since most of the mane six are breaking their stereotype, it's sad they would make her so very stereotype
<StephenCawking> just like black people
<Roara|Touhou> 6your welcome
<Roara|Touhou> 6..
<Manearion> Except... I love zecora!
<Roara|Touhou> 6you're
<Roara|Touhou> 6GOD
<BlacklightShining> …
*drfsupercenter sighs
<Roara|Touhou> 6I HATE THAT TYPO LOL
<BlacklightShining> StephenCawking: now YOU'RE being stereotypical
<BlacklightShining> HYPOCRITE
<StephenCawking> WRONG
<Manearion> And Iprobably wouldn't as much if she wasn't all mystical and talked in rimes!
<The_Crowing> 8 bit giggle at the ghostys...
<StephenCawking> I'm stereotyping
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm one of those people who hates the you're/your and the there/they're/their typos
<StephenCawking> it's a verb too you know
<MrPoniator> Hope you don't think I'm a drunken bastard who doesn't talk!
<Blums> Maybe for the zebra race, they can have every zebra talk in a different rhyme scheme
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<Darkside> http://lapfox.bandcamp.com/track/got-my-pony-spam-for-you <-- still an awesome mix :P
<BlacklightShining> same thing
<Roara|Touhou> 6and yet I tend to perform said typo more than most people LOL
<Crainy> all of this "waaaah stereotypes and racist and whatnot" interpreted in everything is really getting on my nerves
<StephenCawking> no
<StephenCawking> jeez
<Darkside> probably the best one of giggle at the ghostie :P
<StephenCawking> lern english
<Roara|Touhou> 6I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE, I SWEAR I DO

<Dermathil> RBD

<SillyNilly> Random video of the day: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mjcOZf1BfU&list=FLtF17ymRGgUs&index=34
<StephenCawking> Manearion: I love Zecora too. I think maybe the message of the episode is that being a stereotype isn't a bad thing?
<Roara|Touhou> 6m
<BlacklightShining> zeeb?
<NewDCD> 9UNDASTAND
<Roara|Touhou> 6hold on, mibbit ate that link
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL

<prince-dari> Sathi?
<Roara|Touhou> 6tastes like chocolate or somethin
<Light_Latias> 12o-o

<The_Crowing> i kind of like this
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/pJRBv.jpg
<Unidentified30780> and i'm actually glad that there is someone like her, because you don't have totaly soulless clones
<drfsupercenter> 03http://i.imgur.com/ pJRBv.jpg
<Roara|Touhou> 6LOL
<Dermathil> (but they be not bright to think of that on their own, right?)
<drfsupercenter> 03WE SO NEED THAT
<Roara|Touhou> 6THAT'S SO AWESOME
<drfsupercenter> 03I know right
<Roara|Touhou> 6we need that not only on one site, but the internet in general
<CureZen> Hello every one.
<drfsupercenter> 03yep XD
<drfsupercenter> 03but also one with their/they're
<CogWeaver> hello
<drfsupercenter> 03and you're/your
<Dermathil> dem non-aerodynamic planes
<Manearion> Why is celestia radio silent?
<Light_Latias> 12OH
<Darkside> yeah i think he stuffed something up
<drfsupercenter> 03as I swear I see people going "your an idiot" all the time and want to slap them
<Light_Latias> 12Roara
<Darkside> o
<SillyNilly> I am unsure as to why Mr. Bean has Pinkie Pie's hair, MrPoniator
<Darkside> it hit 200
<StephenCawking> so, back to our topic: is it ok for RBD to be gay? shouldn't she be breaking the gay stereotype?
<Light_Latias> 12do you have to do online training as a part of your job?
<Crainy> HOW CAN A GIRL BE GAY?!?!?!?
<StephenCawking> ITS A BLANKET TERM
<Manearion> I do not want RBD gay
<StephenCawking> JEEZ
<Paul_McColtney> Really.
<chocolates> She likes penis
<chocolates> Duh
<drfsupercenter> 03oh hm
<Paul_McColtney> You don't know how a girl can be gay?
<Manearion> I think it would kill what makes her awesome
<chocolates> So she's gay
<Crainy> i doesnt matter
<drfsupercenter> 03THIS Art Institute commercial looks legit
<CogWeaver> chocolates, this is a PG chat
<NewDCD> 9AOYAMA, DAT SMOOTHNESS
<FallSilently> Want or otherwise, it's absolutely never going to come up on the show so all speculation is irrelevant.
<drfsupercenter> 03the link they show is artinstitutes.edu/stories
<Blums> I dont think they'll do sexuality in the show
<Roara|Touhou> 6LL
<Roara|Touhou> 6no
<CogWeaver> that type of talk must go to #EquestriaAfterDark
<drfsupercenter> 03but wtf @ having a .info link for a college, that just made me think it was some poser place LOL
<Dermathil> she's so disappointed...
<Blums> too many parents will rge
<Darkside> swag off?
<Light_Latias> 12good
<Crainy> that stereotyping
<Darkside> what does this mean?
<chocolates> they just said gay and sexuality
<Roara|Touhou> 6the only training outside of on the job was an alcohol training
<chocolates> ._.
<StephenCawking> Sexuality is already in the show
<Roara|Touhou> 6which was a 26 question test
<Roara|Touhou> 6that was it xD
<Light_Latias> 12ah
<StephenCawking> Rarity is straight
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL WTF Alcohol training?
<Light_Latias> 12well
<Light_Latias> 12I bring it up
<Dermathil> THREE OF THE SAME ONES
<Manearion> I have a lot of tomboyish friend, and thaéy are all fed up with this whole "gay" and "manly" thing
<Dermathil> wait
<StephenCawking> heterosexuality is as much sexuality as homosexuality
<Light_Latias> 12because we have online training
<Dermathil> maybe there are people with same firstnames?
<Roara|Touhou> 6drf, laws are really strict about alcohol
<chocolates> Ok
<chocolates> ?
<Light_Latias> 12and this one lesson
<Crainy> only because RBD acts alittle manly, all of the pony community is like : "waaaah lesbian"
<Roara|Touhou> 6and target's policies are just as strict
<Manearion> It's not like all tomboys are Gildas
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03isn't it just
<Unidentified30780> there is more sexuality in your speculations that in the show actually ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03don't sell to anyone under 21
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Light_Latias> 12KEPT mispelling "their" as "thier"
<Light_Latias> 12I cringed
<CogWeaver> a point was made a few moments ago
<Light_Latias> 12each time I saw it
<NewDCD> 9Remember Japanese write the surname first
<CogWeaver> stop discussing this topic
<Dermathil> oh
<CogWeaver> NOW
<Dermathil> members of same family?
<Roara|Touhou> 6don't sell to anyone under 21, you are required to swipe their ID regardless of appearance (even 92 year olds get carded), you can't be under 18 to sell it
<Roara|Touhou> 6etc etc etc
<CogWeaver> or move to #EquestriaAfterDark with it
<CogWeaver> it's not strictly PG appropirate
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<NewDCD> 9yeah, but it's easier finding mistakes like that
<Roara|Touhou> 6I could go on forever lol
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf iTunes
<Light_Latias> 12these are adult people in the company
<Dermathil> ah
<Roara|Touhou> 6there's a lot more to the 21 rule
<Light_Latias> 12who can't spell
<drfsupercenter> 03it just said I inserted a blank CD when there are no such thing o_O
<drfsupercenter> 03*is
<CogWeaver> so make a new topic or go there
<Light_Latias> 12or use spellcheck
<CureZen> Has nothing to sex just relationships
<StephenCawking> ^
<Dermathil> OH SNAP
<Nick> its getting worse in Manchester now...

<Glacymr> 12i fail to see the humor
<Manearion> *Barack
<drfsupercenter> 03but i mean, surely there has a to be a reason people are "pillaging" etc?
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: that's not funny.

<Lakorv> You forget I'm Norwegian, drf
<Light_Latias> 12shouldn't need, but DO need
<ZekeS> CogWeaver: I may or may not have remembered to unset the default autounban time, so you may get your shot :D
<Roara|Touhou> 6police need guns
<Lakorv> our police is unarmed
<drfsupercenter> 03there are people who do shoot at cops
<Glacymr> 12they should be at least armed with high quality tranqs
<Roara|Touhou> 6but then again, this is the US
<Manearion> You guy's fighting over who gets to ban
<Roara|Touhou> 6I dunno about the UK
<Glacymr> 12so they don't harm anyone but can knock them out at a distance
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03tasers only go so far
<Darkside> my goodness, all the noobs in the celestia radio channel
<Crainy> Kick the next guy who goddamn mails me
<CureZen> Johnsey that's impossible
<NewDCD> 9DAT CUTE DESIGNER
<CogWeaver> well he wasn't spamming on purpose
<Crainy> that sound is annoying
<Dermathil> dat designer
<CogWeaver> so I'll unban him
<drfsupercenter> 03I've seen lots of high speed car chases that end with police shooting the tires out LOL
<Roara|Touhou> 6<Light_Latias>	shouldn't need, but DO need
<drfsupercenter> 03good like tasing a tier
<CogWeaver> FAIL COZ
<drfsupercenter> 03*tire
<CogWeaver> FAIL
<CureZen> XD
<Glacymr> 12tier
<Glacymr> 12lol
<Lakorv> our police officers usually wear bats, nothing more.
<FallSilently> !mail Crainy kick
<DerpyBot> Mail delivered! Thank you for using the Derpy Mail Service 6_9
<ZekeS> lol
<Manearion> That's really good intentions
<Roara|Touhou> 6lakorv
<Dermathil> they do make it look bulky and heavy. That be his charm...
<Roara|Touhou> 6that can't happen around here
<drfsupercenter> 03Lakorv, so what happens if someone starts shooting?
<Light_Latias> 12is that an agreement, Roara?
<drfsupercenter> 03do they just die?
<Soital> 12some people's houses were destroyed, thats how out of hand they're getting .w.
<Crainy> nice one....
<Dermathil> ohai Ziltoid
<johnsey> CureZen: you just saw why
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: special forces.
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<StephenCawking> how can you spam on accident?
<Roara|Touhou> 6not when this country is built upon drug cartels and guns
<Roara|Touhou> 6yes, LL
<Manearion> like on cops, when they say it's been a good night when they catcha lot of criminalls...
<Light_Latias> 12he said SHOULDN'T need
<Lakorv> also
<CureZen> So Guys I have an idea
<Lakorv> people don't 'start shooting'
<CureZen> This song
<Light_Latias> 12but they do
<CureZen> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz8n2hzQ0t0&feature=BFp&list=FLqmFzBdeJRCk&index=14
<CureZen> Plus pinkie pie
<Manearion> Isn't a good night if there aren't any crimes going on..?
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah but what if you're dead before you have time to call in special forces
<FallSilently> No, it just means awesome crimes are happening.
<Roara|Touhou> 6it's all regional
<johnsey> StephenCawking: i dunno, it's relatively impossible!
<Lakorv> welcome to Norway, where everything isn't centered around economy, guns and drugs.
<Roara|Touhou> 6yep
<Blums> That song doesnt fit pinkie CureZen
<Lakorv> we have the strictest gun laws in the world.
<Roara|Touhou> 6welcome to the US, the exact opposite
<drfsupercenter> 03it doesn't need to be CENTERED around them
<drfsupercenter> 03see
<drfsupercenter> 03laws
<drfsupercenter> 03mean nothing
<drfsupercenter> 03if you're a CRIMINAL
<Blums> I'd liek to see appleack, rarity, rainbow, or Luna sing it though
<Light_Latias> 12until you get caught
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03but that's not the point
<Dermathil> Dai-guard may have the body of a real robot, but he's got the soul of a super.
<CureZen> Pikie's always wearing costumes
<Lakorv> if you're criminal you don't get guns, and getting them illegally is actually not that easy.
<NewDCD> 9yeah, pretty much
<Lakorv> the Utøya terrorist tried and failed.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's incredibly easy here
<CureZen> or you could switch suit with parties
<CureZen> Either or
<NewDCD> 9it's also realer than most reals
<Roara|Touhou> 6it's horribly easy around here
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Dermathil> eeyup
<Dermathil> that's the charm
<drfsupercenter> 03then there's also things like in Terminator
<drfsupercenter> 03walk into a gun shop
<drfsupercenter> 03take the gun
<drfsupercenter> 03point it at owner
<drfsupercenter> 03bam
*drfsupercenter runs
<Light_Latias> 12a gun store opened up a few months ago here
<Blums> CureZen try putting this to a pony: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGaOQKJik-s
<Roara|Touhou> 6heck, you see how our border situation is right now
<StephenCawking> no one in equestria after dark wants to debate the morality of RBD's orientation
<Sathi> @dari i'm on skype if you need me
*Light_Latias ><;'d
<StephenCawking> lame
<drfsupercenter> 03Light_Latias
<Lakorv> guns are silly.
<drfsupercenter> 03in case of a zombie apocalypze
<drfsupercenter> 03you'l be covered
<drfsupercenter> 03:)
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<drfsupercenter> 03*pse
<Crainy> i dont even want to know what they debate about...
<Dermathil> dat glancing hit
<drfsupercenter> 03Lakorv, I can see where guns would come in handy for hunting, but that's it really
<Light_Latias> 12there's plenty of blunt objects that serve the same purpose :B
<StephenCawking> figures you would be underage
<MrPoniator> Now, Steins;Gate
<Lakorv> you can't provide your population with legal weapons like that and expect them not to use them.
<johnsey> orientation?
<Blums> Stock prices and the stability of the market ofc
<StephenCawking> you know
<StephenCawking> whether she likes colts or not
<drfsupercenter> 03I gave a speech in my class about why handguns should be illegal to own
<drfsupercenter> 03which they aren't >)_>
<MrPoniator> The only show that distracts me from ponies
<Dermathil> DON't TURN THE BOOSTERS ON
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't hunt with a handgun
<johnsey> it's clearly skywards
<Dermathil> OHH SNAP LAZORS
<drfsupercenter> 03so it's basically just designed for killing people >_>
<Roara|Touhou> 6^
<abirkin2> there's no morality to it?
<Lakorv> drfsupercenter: here you need a strict hunting licence in order to even buy a gun.
<Roara|Touhou> 6see
<Roara|Touhou> 6drf
<Light_Latias> 12they're "for protection"
<StephenCawking> is too
<Light_Latias> 12tho
<drfsupercenter> 03rifles and shotguns actually serve a legit purpose
<Roara|Touhou> 6thats actually half right
<Roara|Touhou> 6handguns are legal
<abirkin2> since morality is likely an abstract concept forged by man?
<Light_Latias> 12you shouldnt keep them on you
<Roara|Touhou> 6for house protection
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Roara|Touhou> 6but people lie about that
<drfsupercenter> 03why do you need a handgun
<Roara|Touhou> 6so that's the problem
<drfsupercenter> 03youc an protect yourself just as well with a shotgun
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<Light_Latias> 12because then you NEED protection from those who have them
<Skylands> 10[15:52] <drfsupercenter> so it's basically just designed for killing people >_> <- Nope, you can use them in shooting ranges to hit targets
<StephenCawking> and ponies have likely forged the same concept?
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Skylands> 10It's a hobby
<Light_Latias> 12hai Sky
<NewDCD> 9USING FOOT TO PILOT ROBOT
<abirkin2> and thus is likely wholly subjective?
<drfsupercenter> 03You don't need to own a gun to shoot targets
<Dermathil> nice one with the spin reversal.
<NewDCD> 9LIKE A BAWS
<Lakorv> ban all handguns, then no one can attack with them, so you don't need them for protection.
<drfsupercenter> 03just go to the range and borrow one :P
<Dermathil> I wouldn't have thought of that one
<Crainy> Ô.o
<Light_Latias> 12Lakorv
<drfsupercenter> 03Lakorv
<Roara|Touhou> 6lakorv it's too late
<drfsupercenter> 03you don't get the point
<Light_Latias> 12ban+eliminate
<Roara|Touhou> 6ban wont do squat
<drfsupercenter> 03CRIMINALS
<drfsupercenter> 03DO NOT
<drfsupercenter> 03FOLLOW
<drfsupercenter> 03LAWS
<Roara|Touhou> 6there are millions of guns in this country
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Lakorv> sheesh, drf
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm all for making them illegal
<StephenCawking> and people like to debate about their subjective values?
<Light_Latias> 12^
<prince-dari> ORDER THE TAKEOFF!
<CureZen> Blums I don't know about ponies but thats going in my favorites
<Lakorv> no reason to yell
<Glacymr> 12i like watching world's dumbest o3o
<Blums> XD
<Flamerunner> What the party MEANS.
<Roara|Touhou> 6and the ban wouldnt help, unless you find a way to spontaneously combust every gun in the country at once
<drfsupercenter> 03but that doesn't mean you wouldn't need them
*drfsupercenter slaps Glacymr
<Skylands> 10banning guns in America would just result in more crimes
<Light_Latias> 12unless they're all destroyed
<Dermathil> They should prepare all the papers in advance
<Roara|Touhou> 6in which case, HERE COMES THE BLACK MARKET LOL
<Lakorv> I'm perfectly competent of reading your words on one line, all lowercased.
<Light_Latias> 12then nothing'll change
<drfsupercenter> 03Lakorv, when I've said it like 20 times, it kinda proves you aren't paying attention.
<Glacymr> 12what?
<Blums> "Hey you, give me a thousand dollars" "A thousand dollars? wow! why?*moustache flys off*"
<Light_Latias> 12except the innocent will feel more inclined to break the law
<drfsupercenter> 03you used that face D:
<Dermathil> you know, you make a template where you scan and copy the paper multiple times.
<Light_Latias> 12and keep one on them for protection
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Peter_K> hey Fella
<Dermathil> just 1 signature needed
<drfsupercenter> 03I think they should just not let you buy a gun that can't be used for huntinmg
<drfsupercenter> 03you can easily protect your house with a shotgun
<drfsupercenter> 03or a rifle
<drfsupercenter> 03you don't need to MURDER someone who gets on your property
<Skylands> 10lolrifle
*Dermathil needs to cook something.
<Dermathil> Brb
<drfsupercenter> 03rifles are awesome
<Roara|Touhou> 6drf
*drfsupercenter actually enjoys shooting rifles
<Skylands> 10Indeed
<Roara|Touhou> 6yuo can actually
<drfsupercenter> 03at targets, obviously.
<Roara|Touhou> 6*you

<johnsey> StephenCawking: <twilight>prove it</twilight> ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03sniper scopes make them more fun XD
<Roara|Touhou> 6you don't know what someone has planned when they break into your house
<NewDCD> 9*SHEEP
<DesertRose> badabumbee
<Light_Latias> 12^
<Roara|Touhou> 6in which case, the law protects you against killing them
<Dermathil> BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
<Roara|Touhou> 6it's self defense
<Ziltoid> BABABBABABBABABBABABABBA<
<Lakorv> drf, when you've said it 20 times, it kinda proves you've said it 20 times. I heard you and I /know/ criminals don't. That's why they're criminals.
<StephenCawking> prove what?
<Blums> ponies have made it into HTML5? awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03no but I mean
<Skylands> 10The thing with being able to use rifles to protect yourself, yes, but they're very noticeable
<Crainy> it
<Roara|Touhou> 6for all you know, it could be some mentally deranged kidnapper
<drfsupercenter> 03you can also just shoot them in the foot
<drfsupercenter> 03you don't need to KILL Them
<Roara|Touhou> 6drf
<Dermathil> Ziltoid, get in #P&D early, alright?
<Light_Latias> 12Sky
<Skylands> 10Hand guns can be hidden
<johnsey> 21:53:07 < StephenCawking> and ponies have likely forged the same concept?
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm aiming at their chest if they break into my house
<Roara|Touhou> 6end of story
<Ziltoid> ok
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm not thinking WHERE to shoot
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm shooting
<Skylands> 10and your enemny/whoever won't know you have one on you
<drfsupercenter> 03well we don't own a gu./
<drfsupercenter> 03*gun
<Light_Latias> 12only more dangerous people need to keep something like that hidden
<Roara|Touhou> 6if they die, then so be it
<johnsey> Blums: nah, XML :P
<Dermathil> Btw, NewDCD: mind checking if that's with Sub?
<Dermathil> BA BA BA
<Dusklight> what the hell is this?
<NewDCD> 9it is
<StephenCawking> well, they seem to have some pretty solid concepts about right and wrong
<NewDCD> 9I just put them on
<Lakorv> if people break in here, they're pretty low to start with
<Lakorv> but if so were
<Dermathil> alright
<Skylands> 10Light, whut
<Roara|Touhou> 6^
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like the discussion I had yesterday about how security systems only keep the honest out
<Lakorv> there's not even a topic about shooting
<Lakorv> no one keeps guns here.
<Crainy> what are you guys talking about O_....
<Light_Latias> 12you shouldn't need to have a concealed weapon
<Lakorv> luckily.
<drfsupercenter> 03if you have a giant sticker on your house saying you have ADT, then criminals will just find someone who knows how to crack ADT alarm systems and you'll be robbed anyway.
<drfsupercenter> 03<Light_Latias> you shouldn't need to have a concealed weapon <- agreed
<Blums> Everything and Nothing
<Roara|Touhou> 6lol
<Skylands> 10So DRF
<Light_Latias> 12because
<Skylands> 10What happens when police forces won't be able to protect you?
<Dermathil> a fort? It is a PIER
<BitZero> Lovely assumptions.
<Light_Latias> 12lets say your neighbor feels uncomfortable
<drfsupercenter> 03Skylands, protect me against what?
<Skylands> 10There's not enough of them
<Blums> Yes, No, Both, Superposition, and Entaglement
<Roara|Touhou> 6intruder, potential murderer
<Light_Latias> 12that they feel you have a concealed weapon because you feel the same about them
<Roara|Touhou> 6whatever
<Ziltoid> dat drill arm
<Skylands> 10I don't know, say economy collapse and everyone goes berserk
<Dermathil> eeyup
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<Light_Latias> 12you both buy handguns and conceal them
<drfsupercenter> 03police != citizens
<PsychicKid> "came out of the stable"
<Roara|Touhou> 6like right now in UK, riots
<PsychicKid> Really now?
<drfsupercenter> 03police already have handguns LOL
<Roara|Touhou> 6lol
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL ragequit
<Roara|Touhou> 6he left
*Skylands facepalms
<Minnet> Okay, bye!
<Roara|Touhou> 6I actually enjoy these debates
<Light_Latias> 12'it'll end up with one or both of you shooting
<Roara|Touhou> 6they're quite interesting
<Skylands> 10Citizens will be attacking EACH OTHER
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah Skylands I don't get your point
<Skylands> 10To fight for survival of food etc
<drfsupercenter> 03I never said I didn't want police to have guns
<drfsupercenter> 03so o_O
<Roara|Touhou> 6what dont you get?
<Light_Latias> 12what Sky said
<drfsupercenter> 03I just said security systems are pointless
<Roara|Touhou> 6actually hold on
<Dermathil> dat ignored
<Roara|Touhou> 6I lost mysefl here
<Light_Latias> 12is comparable to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina
<Peter_K> Hi!
<Light_Latias> 12where people in that area
<Light_Latias> 12did just about anything
<Flamerunner> i feel like killing somepony.
<Peter_K> That's no good.
<NewDCD> 9I wish my job involved piloting a giant robot
<Blums> "Pony stomping day"
<Skylands> 10^
<Dermathil> dem hair-horns
<Light_Latias> 12attacking each other, looting, etc
<Light_Latias> 12they were scared
<Light_Latias> 12confused
<drfsupercenter> 03where are we going with this
<Skylands> 10Not enough police force to keep everyone in their shoes
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Light_Latias> 12and a cornered animal WILL attack
<drfsupercenter> 03there are around here
<Skylands> 10My point: hand guns should not be banned
<Light_Latias> 12same goes with people
<drfsupercenter> 03...
<drfsupercenter> 03why does a gun need to be concealed to protect you
<Dusklight> remember, its the music that we choose
<NewDCD> 9AMERICANU DORIIM
<Peter_K> When's that? jk
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Ray03)02WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<drfsupercenter> 03shotguns easily do more damage anyway :P
<Skylands> 10Think of it this way too:
<^Stargazer> hihi everypony
<Dermathil> DAT AMERICAN DREAM
<drfsupercenter> 03just tear a hole in their chest LOL

<Dermathil> he's gonna be so disappointed
<NewDCD> 9Celestia comissions a Giant Robot
<NewDCD> 9wat do
<Light_Latias> 12maybe weight is a factor
<Dermathil> GURREN LAGANN
<Dermathil> MIXED WITH DAI-GUARD
<Dermathil> IN PONY FORM
<Light_Latias> 12as aren't shotguns and rifles heavier?
<Dermathil> mehehehe
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03but unless you're a 3 year old
<drfsupercenter> 03you should be able to hold it
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<Skylands> 10If someone sees you have a rifle on you, either A) they'll attack you for it (yes, some people are very brave and go after anything they can get) or B) they'll run away scared
<Fireant> Hey.
<Skylands> 10So
<FallSilently> Hello
<Skylands> 1050/50
<Roara|Touhou> 6ok I've actually lost everyone's views on this topic
<drfsupercenter> 03whereas if you have your gun hidden you'll just be shot before you get a chance to shoot back
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Roara|Touhou> 6we went ona tangeant here LOL
<NewDCD> 9I was more thinking of developing a mass production Real Robot line under the line of "Mount Blades"
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, why are we talking about complete chaos situations anyway
<Skylands> 10Also
<Light_Latias> 12Roara, we've gone on multiple at this point
<Dermathil> lololol
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm talking about actual LIKELY scenarios
<User_1121> What did I just read?!
<Skylands> 10"It's not guns that kill people, but the people with the guns"
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<Peter_K> Stuff
<Peter_K> probly
<Light_Latias> 12because they happen
<Skylands> 10Or however that went
<FallSilently> What DID you just read?
<drfsupercenter> 03Skylands
<Skylands> 10We have too many irresponsible people out there
<Roara|Touhou> 6^
<drfsupercenter> 03it's legal to own assault rifles
<drfsupercenter> 03now
<drfsupercenter> 03what good reason is tehre for that

<drfsupercenter> 03I mean like AK-47 type assault rifles
<drfsupercenter> 03my uncle has a few
<Crainy> like a ninja
<Skylands> 10I dunno
<FallSilently> Zero Tolerance
<drfsupercenter> 03he's a collector, but still... why would anyone need to have a gun like that
<Light_Latias> 12some people collect them
<User_1121> If you ask me,the writer of cupcakes should be dragged out into the street and shot.
<Light_Latias> 12strange hobby tbh
<Skylands> 10So guns aren't really the problem, it's the people
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't conceal it, and hunting with an assault rifle is stupid, it's basically just aimed at serial killers LOL
<Crainy> well
<Crainy> why do you read that?
<Dermathil> yes he do, Justice.
<Dermathil> or they fire him.
<Crainy> i mean
<Dermathil> give him the pink slip.
<Crainy> i´ve never red it
<NewDCD> 9ACE ATTORNEY: GIANT ROBOT EDITIONS
<Light_Latias> 12then lets aim them at serial killers?
<Dermathil> hehehe
*Light_Latias shot
<Skylands> 10:P
<drfsupercenter> 03still
<Crainy> why did it became so famous in the first place?
<Roara|Touhou> 6I honestly think the current gun laws are way to lax, and way to scattered
<Light_Latias> 12^
<FallSilently> Yeah I haven't read Cupcakes either and don't plan to.
<drfsupercenter> 03^
<^Stargazer> what became famous?
<Roara|Touhou> 6drf has a good point that the kind of guns allowed are ridiculous
<Fireant> Well.
<Crainy> cupcakes
<FallSilently> Because it was early, I think.
<^Stargazer> oh, that fic

<johnsey> it's allowed actually
<Light_Latias> 12it's paranoia
<Fireant> ^

<Skylands> 10Light, no
*Light_Latias hides
<drfsupercenter> 03those things were as much dangerous to the user as the person being shot at
<NewDCD> 9DERP
<Roara|Touhou> 6ok well
<User_9089> 5th of August,yeah.
<Skylands> 10It's a weapon wielded by one of the characters in that anime
<Fireant> CogWeaver, seriously, we are not American PG :p
<Light_Latias> 12oh
<Roara|Touhou> 6my views on guns to restrict them to personal territory only, unless hunting
<Dermathil> in the stadium that was used to group up the evacueees
<drfsupercenter> 03agreed
<Blums> Can we use it in the context of "Fornification Under Consent of King" or "For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge"?
<CogWeaver> w/e
<Roara|Touhou> 6in which case, hunting is a whole different story
<Crainy> American, LOL
<Fireant> Even minors know the word fuck, so don't try to be victorian prudes here ;)
<drfsupercenter> 03and even then
<Roara|Touhou> 6because that requires separate permits, certain locations, etc
<drfsupercenter> 03only if you registered as private property and you have a sign up saying it's such
<User_9089> But,*in AppleBloom style* I WANT THE NEXT ONE NOWWW!
<drfsupercenter> 03because legally
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't shoot someone on your property unless it's private property that you own
<drfsupercenter> 03even now
<Sketchy_Sounds> Knowing a word doesn't mean we want to see it used.

<drfsupercenter> 03they can sue you if they break their leg
<CogWeaver> don't worry about it, Sketchy
<Blums> Ok so extended forms then
<Dermathil> I dunno why but I actually like the MiB
<drfsupercenter> 03what makes you think you'd win that case
<Dermathil> he looks like a nice fella

<Flamerunner|AoE2> Yay for Age of Empires 2
<Light_Latias> 12-8
<Blums> Bits? sorry i'm not versed in gundam
<Crainy> yay
<User_9089> Thank you.That's all I needed.
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<NewDCD> 9man
<drfsupercenter> 03if they have a gun
<Light_Latias> 12only THEN can *I* sue?
<drfsupercenter> 03and it looks like they're going to use it
<drfsupercenter> 03then you could say it was self defense
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<Light_Latias> 12then I'm already dead
<abirkin2> Blums: Bits are psychically controlled flying beam guns, allowing the so-called "All Range Attack"
<drfsupercenter> 03if someone sets a foot on your yard and you shoot them on sight
<drfsupercenter> 03that wouldn't win
<drfsupercenter> 03as self defense
<NewDCD> 9I should try hosting "Giant Robot Saturday Night" or something
<Light_Latias> 12yes
<Light_Latias> 12but your HOUSE
<Dermathil> OH THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.
<drfsupercenter> 03again, only if it's private property
<Crainy> wow
<drfsupercenter> 03same thing
<Crainy> thats...
<Light_Latias> 12door/window broken
<Crainy> interesting
<abirkin2> the difference between a Bit and a Funnel is that a Bit has an onboard reactor and a Funnel runs off of a battery
<Dermathil> BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
<crono_flash> Second that
<drfsupercenter> 03self defense means they have to do something that puts your life at risk first
<Light_Latias> 12I'll defend myself
<Skylands> 10[16:18] <drfsupercenter> if someone sets a foot on your yard and you shoot them on sight <- That rarely, if never happens though
<Crainy> fascinating
<NewDCD> 9>Child of the Sun
<Light_Latias> 12yes
<drfsupercenter> 03says the one whos dad walks around with a gun
<Nightseas> 12Robbery don’t always equal murder
<Fireant> Not really.
<NewDCD> 9DAT KAMEN RIDER BLACK RX REFERENCE
<Light_Latias> 12they're in my house uninvited
<Light_Latias> 12and
<User_9089> Season 2 is coming out in December right?
<Dermathil> What we could try to make could be like a tv channel?
<Light_Latias> 12since I'm not a mind reader
<Skylands> 10DRF
<^Stargazer> that's when it finishes
<Light_Latias> 12I can't tell their purpose
<Skylands> 10What do you mean?
<CogWeaver> no
<^Stargazer> they never said when season 2 would start
<abirkin2> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2womniRmq0 funnels in action
<Roara|Touhou> 6ok
<Roara|Touhou> 6here's a situation
<Sunny> 02herro :3
<Dermathil> imagine Bronystate turning in the equivalent of a tv channel with ponies but other stuff too
<^Stargazer> and that's probably an estimated guess at best
<drfsupercenter> 03your dad seems like the type that WOULD shoot someone just for stepping on your grass LOL
<CogWeaver> at latest the HUB will put it out in december
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Skylands> 10No
<prince-dari> Would be cool.
<Light_Latias> 12...
<Skylands> 10>_>
<prince-dari> We need to download 100s of different programs. XD
<Fireant> Beginning of December.
<drfsupercenter> 03so then why carry it with you
<Light_Latias> 12that was RUDE Danny
<CogWeaver> they'll be done with animation and such around mid to late september
<crono_flash> that could be interesting
<Dermathil> hehehe
<NewDCD> 9The problem would be...yeah.
<Skylands> 10He is responsible with his
<User_9089> So,anywhere between now and December?
<Sketchy_Sounds> About the only thing we know for certain about season 2 is it has more Luna, more Derpy, and all the animatic stuff has been done.
<prince-dari> I've got series 1-5 Doctor Who
<Skylands> 10and what Light just said
<NewDCD> 9not to mention the electric bill and the difficulty of setting stuff in auto-pilot
<prince-dari> And series 1-2 Torchwood
*Sunny just joined the convo
<Skylands> 10I took MUCH offense to that
<Fireant> And return of Snails.
<Sathi> you forgot someone
<Fireant> Yay.
<prince-dari> My computer is on 100% of the time anyway.
<Crainy> and dont want more derpy...
<Sathi> House MD!
<Light_Latias> 12hai Sunny
<^Stargazer> the guy who makes the music also mentioned a Twilight solo song as well was in the works
<Skylands> 10You don't know my dad
<crono_flash> I'm currently watching The Doctor
<BlacklightShining> moar Derpy!
<User_9089> They didn't replace any voice actors did they?
<Roara|Touhou> 6You've gone to bed for the night, someone decides to break into your house. You hear the noise, pull out your gun not knowing who it is. You walk out and find a man in the halway, someone you don't know, and he is only a few feet from the door that leads to your child's room. He seems to be looking around for things to steal, but you don't know for sure.
<Dermathil> I mean stuff like Sci-fi monday, Mecha Wednesday, PONY Thursday, etc
<Sunny> 02hi LL :D
<Sketchy_Sounds> I don't believe they did
<Fireant> Yes User_2164 they did.
<prince-dari> Sathi, yeah I'll have that too when it's downloaded.
<Dusklight> Derpy needs to not be a background character
<^Stargazer> daniel... I forget his last name
<BlacklightShining> ^
<NewDCD> 9I could only stream late Saturdays with my current schedule though
<Fireant> Twilight is now voiced by Morgan Freeman.
<Nightseas> 12He carries around a musket like a boss
<drfsupercenter> 03what if you shoot him, miss, and hit your kid instead :P
*Nightseas runs
<Roara|Touhou> 6you have the gun, you dont know if this man is simply a burglar, or if he's going to enter your child's room, and if he's armed or not
<Xiagu> Daniel Ingram does the songs
<CogWeaver> Daniel Ingram, ^Stargazer
<Crainy> is that a negative?
<Fireant> And Rarity by Jim Carrey.
<Roara|Touhou> 6you have the gun in your hand-
<Roara|Touhou> 6drf
<^Stargazer> ty
<Roara|Touhou> 6what the hecll
<Roara|Touhou> 6hell
<NewDCD> 9that's why I'm not streaming Movie Nights when the semester starts, remember?
<Zanzibar> I'm not sure if that would make it better or worse.
<Dermathil> also, the european viewings of the movies could impact with the shows
<Roara|Touhou> 6did you REALLY just say that?
<^Stargazer> names were never my strong point =/
<Dermathil> yeah
<Blums> Applejack is now voiced by taylor swift
<drfsupercenter> 03yes
<drfsupercenter> 03I did
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<Nick> lol hecll
<CogWeaver> o_o
<NewDCD> 9And thus I could host Mecha Nights on Saturdays at 9:30 PM EST or something
<abirkin2> basically, the key advantage of Bits and Funnels is that they can allow a pilot to attack from many different angles of attack, making combatting them that much harder
<drfsupercenter> 03also so much for not swearing @ Aurora
<drfsupercenter> 03o.o
<Light_Latias> 12in the HALLWAY Danny
<Blums> and trixie by justin bieber
<Roara|Touhou> 6to humor you
<BitZero> That sounds terrible.
<Fireant> And Charlie Sheen voices Celestia.
<Light_Latias> 12LRN 2 READ
<Roara|Touhou> 6the door is shut
<Dermathil> stuff like that
<CogWeaver> O_o
<CogWeaver> oh gosh, Blums
<SillyNilly> Correction. Morgan Freemane.
<drfsupercenter> 03OK fine
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Roara|Touhou> 6as in your shot will not hit the kid
<Xiagu> Bonbon gets a new voice actor every word this time instead of every appearance
<CogWeaver> no
<Skylands> 10[16:21] <drfsupercenter> what if you shoot him, miss, and hit your kid instead :P
<Peter_K> Well. i just finished reading cupcakes. can i get a kleenex
<Skylands> 10It's called going to a shooting range and practicing
<FallSilently> :)
<CogWeaver> Celestia is going to be voiced by Morgan Freeman
<drfsupercenter> 03if you're asleep
<^Stargazer> lol @ Xiagu
<BlacklightShining> O_O
<Fireant> Peter_K, you fapped to it?
<FallSilently> Depends on who you plan to kill with the kleenex
<Dermathil> we shoose three or four different mecha shows, 1 episode of each every Saturday, for example
<drfsupercenter> 03I doubt you could fire with that insane accuracy if you're woken up
<Fireant> Oh, sorry... clopped?
<Light_Latias> 12adrenaline
<BlacklightShining> you…you read Cupcakes?
<Dermathil> *choose
<Roara|Touhou> 6I swore because that was even colder than the last thing you said about too bad if you live in ghettos
<Peter_K> NO
<Skylands> 10^
<crono_flash> Wish I could help
<drfsupercenter> 03not always LOL
<Light_Latias> 12is the key
<Peter_K> EW
<Blums> Xiagu how about every syllable?
<Xiagu> Peter_K, I would suggest a paper bag for the vomit instead of a tissue
<User_9089> As soon as they hear Justin Bieber there,MLP will be gone for good.
*Sketchy_Sounds cackles
<Roara|Touhou> 6ok drf
<Roara|Touhou> 6what would you do
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like how in L4D2 if you take adrenaline, you can still die :P
<BitZero> Heh.
<Roara|Touhou> 6would you really just stand there and watch?
<Peter_K> I READ IT NOW IN GOING TO CRY IN A CORNER
<BlacklightShining> User_9089: ?!?
<Psyentific> I've fapped to Cupcakes.
<Light_Latias> 12wtf
<User_9089> NOTHING will revive it.
<BlacklightShining> O_O
<Psyentific> Was hot.
<Light_Latias> 12is the point
<drfsupercenter> 03I wouldn't stand ther no, but I'd run up going WTF are you doing
<Roara|Touhou> 6let the guy possibly murder you, the kid, kidnap, etc
<Light_Latias> 12of bringing up a GAME
<Xiagu> Blums, that would be too hard to pull off. Don't be silly :)
<Nightseas> 12This conversation keeps getting better |D
<FallSilently> http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/Gross.jpg
<Sketchy_Sounds> We don't need to know this
<Roara|Touhou> 6and if he has a gun of his own?
<Crainy> you guys are unbelievable
<BitZero> ^
<CogWeaver> you really are
<Psyentific> Watch, somepony is going to make that quote of the day.
<BitZero> But I'm used to it.
<Roara|Touhou> 6then you're dead
<Yetti> User_9089 - now that wasn't funny :/
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<Roara|Touhou> 6so bye
<Sunny> 02how did that convo got started anyway?
<drfsupercenter> 03then pull some epic Batman move and slap the gun away before he has a chance to use it
<Light_Latias> 12your natural adrenaline
<Light_Latias> 12wakes you up
<Roara|Touhou> 6>.>
<Dermathil> what they need to do is fire up the production lines
<Dermathil> and make MOAR DAI-GUARDS
<Sunny> 02specially fear
<User_9089> Because it's the truth.
<Roara|Touhou> 6that line right there made me not pay attention to this conversation anymore lool
<drfsupercenter> 03it takes time to pull a gun out of your pocket
<Blums> So... Rebecca black guest voicing in a musical instead?
<Light_Latias> 12just seeing someone suspicious in your house near your child
<Roara|Touhou> 6drf
<Dermathil> for military and civillian uses
<CogWeaver> e_o
<drfsupercenter> 03if they're already holding it, fine
<Light_Latias> 12and under adrenaline
<Light_Latias> 12you move faster than normal
<User_9089> And you say I'm bad!
<Roara|Touhou> 6actually no
<Crainy> NOT FUNNY
<Roara|Touhou> 6I don't feel like responding lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> To quote Spike
<Fireant> OH
<drfsupercenter> 03but if not, you can run up and just tackle them before they even get a chance to get it
<Fireant> Look!
<Roara|Touhou> 6it's not going to go anywhere
<FallSilently> What's Rebecca Black doing these days, anyone know?
<Fireant> Its muted now :p
<CogWeaver> orly?
<Fireant> Yes, magic.
<drfsupercenter> 03LL, moving faster != being accurate with a gun in the middle of the night
<CogWeaver> NOWAI
<Fireant> How about them ponies, Rite?
<Dermathil> >facepalm
<Light_Latias> 12it means you can get it aimed faster
<CogWeaver> inorite?
<Skylands> 10[16:23] <drfsupercenter> it takes time to pull a gun out of your pocket
<Light_Latias> 12etc
<Roara|Touhou> 6my point being if I have a gun in my hands, and this person could potentially have one, I'd either use the gun on the spot or hold it up as a threat
<Skylands> 10Better than not having a chance at all to defend yourself
<Light_Latias> 12^
<Roara|Touhou> 6and the first aggressive response from the stranger, I shoot
<Roara|Touhou> 6in better chances, the stranger would run
<Fireant> Sweet and cute, IMMA RIGHT?
<BitZero> I know left.
<Nightseas> 12.-.
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, holding the gun up is fine
<Fireant> Ohoho BitZero
<CogWeaver> so...um
<drfsupercenter> 03but you don't need a handgun to scare someone :LOP
<drfsupercenter> 03*:P
<Roara|Touhou> 6skylands, I think he was talking about the intruder pulling a gun out of his pocket
<Fireant> You are such a game!
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<CogWeaver> not that this isn't fun or anything, but...
<Skylands> 10k
<Roara|Touhou> 6since I had stated you'd pulled the gun from your drawer already
<Light_Latias> 12it's an added bonus
<CogWeaver> ??
<Blums> Because friendship, Is magic.
<FallSilently> *gasp*
<Roara|Touhou> 6so it's assumed to be in your hand lol
<SilverSonic> o_O what in the bloody hell did i return too O_o
<Dermathil> CUTE PUPPY
<Light_Latias> 12XD SS
<Roara|Touhou> 6gun debate
<Dermathil> DAAAAAWWWWWWWW
<drfsupercenter> 03oh woah
<drfsupercenter> 03our power just went out
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh yay we can talk again
*Fireant look at CogWeaver with evil eye.
<Peter_K> You need voice (+v) (#EquestriaDaily) what does this mean?
<drfsupercenter> 03I heard a loud thunderclap and boom went the power
<Light_Latias> 12brb
*^Stargazer has no issues with silence, laughs a little
<Fireant> "Don't you dare to play with my console!"
<Blums> quick! use the counter evil eye!
<FallSilently> I always feel like I'm being force-choked when that happens.
<Roara|Touhou> 6I think a gun would be more helpful in scaring a man from my house than just fists
<drfsupercenter> 03GOD DANG IT STOP BEEPING BATTERY BACKUP I KNOW THE POWER IS OUT
<CrazyPurple> who needs voice?
<drfsupercenter> 03there we go, generator kicked on
<Roara|Touhou> 6especialyl if the intruder decides he could take me ina fight
*CogWeaver shrinks back from his Overlord's gaze* I'm sorry! dun kill meh! DX
<Peter_K> ?
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's an IRC thing, Peter_K
<Sunny> 02sad...
<CogWeaver> there fixed!
<CogWeaver> DUN KILL MEH!
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL well, that part I guess depends on how tough you look
<drfsupercenter> 03someone like my dad could easily scare someone off with fists
<Dermathil> ANOTHER SHELL
<Nightseas> 12Same
<Blums> it happens when he sets +m . It mutes the channel
<BlacklightShining> …
*BlacklightShining glowers at CogWeaver
<BlacklightShining> what for you do that?!
<CogWeaver> okay, enough of this
<Sketchy_Sounds> Basically it means anyone who hasn't been +v'd by the admins can't be heard.
<Xiagu> Peter_K, 	TL;DR When somepony sets the channel mode +m (mute), only hops/ops and people with voice (+v) can talk
<Dusklight> lol
<Dusklight> really?
<drfsupercenter> 03I've seen way too many movies to justify keeping a gun in the house LOL, that almost never ends well for the people in the movies
<CrazyPurple> oh okay... i think i understand xD
<Crainy> this chat has sound ?...
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<Sketchy_Sounds> Really.
<Roara|Touhou> 6and then there are the idiots who dont care and will fight anyways
<Skylands> 10Movies =/= reality
<Yetti> hehe, good old irc times :P
<abirkin2> I HATE TL;DR
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...
<Light_Latias> 12movies are dramatized
<drfsupercenter> 03like, you think soemone's broken in so you get ready to shoot them and then realize it's just your husband coming home from work at 3am
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
*Sketchy_Sounds bangs head against desk
<Xiagu> it's metaphorical Crainy :/
<StephenCawking> Vanned? Who's getting vanned?
<Blums> i guess you could keep changing your nickname to communicate through the mute
<StephenCawking> I swear I didn't know their flanks were blank
<Light_Latias> 12fists vs gun
<Light_Latias> 12gun wins
<Blums> but they'd probably ban you for that
<Fireant> Blums, eeeenope.
<drfsupercenter> 03not if you punch them first
<Light_Latias> 12gun vs gun
<Roara|Touhou> 6ok well
<Peter_K> iu
<Solistlugia> O.o
<Roara|Touhou> 6think about it lol
<Fireant> It wouldn't work ;(
<Fireant> ;)
<Light_Latias> 12guns have a longer reach
<Roara|Touhou> 6turna light on, see if you know the person LOL
<Light_Latias> 12derp
<NewDCD> 9but yeah
<NewDCD> 9got to think about which series to stream
<Blums> Really fireant? I've seen namechanges when +m was set
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<NewDCD> 9Gundam X is obligatory
<Crainy> ...
<drfsupercenter> 03given your scenario
<drfsupercenter> 03did you turn the light on? :P
<Roara|Touhou> 6I think a husband would even let you know its them
<NewDCD> 9might insert some Z Gundam there too
<Roara|Touhou> 6"who's there?"
<NewDCD> 9some SRW, some Dai Guard
<Sketchy_Sounds> Name changes don't get around +m though
<NewDCD> 9some Eureka 7
<drfsupercenter> 03what if he was just checking on the kid
<Light_Latias> 12^
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<Roara|Touhou> 6intruder- no answer
<Dermathil> Gurren Lagann, Dai-Guard, Gundam X, what about Evangelion?
<Roara|Touhou> 6husband- me
<^Stargazer> lol
*Sunny carries solistlugia out while coveringl his ears ... too young for this xD
<crono_flash> How about MEGAS XLR
<FallSilently> They seemed to.
<Light_Latias> 12^^^^^
<Light_Latias> 12@Roara's
<drfsupercenter> 03that's what I mean, I'd at least see wtf is going on before I just shoot someone
<Dermathil> Megas ain't japanese
<NewDCD> 9Will stream the Gurren-Lagann movie eventually. Everyone's watched GL already so yeah
<CogWeaver> yeah, it SAYS you shouldn't be able to change your nicks while it's +m'd....but yet it still happens... >_>
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<Dermathil> actually
<drfsupercenter> 03just seeing someone in my house is not reason enough to shoot
<Crainy> damn it
<Light_Latias> 12we're not saying shoot at a moments notice
<NewDCD> 9it's GIANT ROBOT NIGHTS, not Japanese Giant Robot nights
<Dermathil> I heard a few in chat haven't
<Crainy> needed to relog
<Dermathil> oh
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm not going to shoot on instinct, I'm going to find out who it is
<Dermathil> yeah
<Sketchy_Sounds> What i mean by that is, it still wouldn't let you be heard lol
<NewDCD> 9I used to stream Megas before
<Blums> you didnt miss nuthin
<Roara|Touhou> 6unless it's very clearly aggressive
<NewDCD> 9I'd be willing to
<Dermathil> then Megas is good too
<BitZero> ... That wouldn't make sense, CogWeaver. +m is channel-wide while chaning your nickname is network-wide.
<Fireant> <Sketchy_Sounds> What i mean by that is, it still wouldn't let you be heard lol
<drfsupercenter> 03also Light_Latias I love how you're supposedly non-violent, but yet you're in favor of shooting people o9_O
<drfsupercenter> 03-9
<Dermathil> no problem then
<NewDCD> 9okay, Megas
<Light_Latias> 12but it's better to have and not need then need and not hsve
<Light_Latias> 12*a
<FallSilently> Well that's great, but I gave my FallSilently nick such a long and awkward password that it'd be too much hassle to abuse.
<BitZero> *changing
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<Fireant> Exacta
<Solistlugia> Lol
<CogWeaver> that's odd
<Light_Latias> 12if it's for a mother's child
<Fireant> And well, also, banhammers, rite? xD
<Roara|Touhou> 6in which case, that's either not my husband or he's clearly not a good person lol
<Crainy> thanks Blums
<NewDCD> 9I'll research more series
<Dermathil> DAT BASEBALL
<Light_Latias> 12the mother would do anything
<drfsupercenter> 03well I'm just saying, given the scenario you gave, if you see someone walking towards your child's room, it could easily be your husband checking on the kid LOL
<Skylands> 10During rough times, of course LL would be for it
<Dermathil> what about Evangelion^
<Light_Latias> 12to keep the child safe
<Dermathil> I heard it was good
<Barry> Hi
<Blums> Banvils to make the collection complete
<Dermathil> ohai Barry
<NewDCD> 9Evangelion's good but WAY overrated
<drfsupercenter> 03plus
<NewDCD> 9and too manestream
<Sketchy_Sounds> Am I actually "audible" so to speak currently?
<Roara|Touhou> 6I did mention it was an intruder
<Light_Latias> 12then you tell them to self-identify
<Roara|Touhou> 6not the husband
<CrazyPurple> ...best pony battle!?
<CogWeaver> (speaking of banhammers, mine's bigger than Fireant's! XP)
<Dermathil> alright
<Xiagu> I've always imagined banhammers having a little adjustable dial on them
<drfsupercenter> 03there are drawbacks to every situation
<drfsupercenter> 03how would you KNOW it's an intruder
*CogWeaver runs away*
<FallSilently> Yes, Sketchy, we can hear you
<drfsupercenter> 03they aren't going to have a sign on their backs aying I BROKE IN
<Light_Latias> 12they don't respond?
<Sketchy_Sounds> OK cool.
<Dermathil> what about the Nadesico show that I once heard about?
<Roara|Touhou> 6if it was the husband...I'd think I'd look in YOUR OWN BED to see if he was there
<Dermathil> It is good?
<Crainy> mhpf
<Roara|Touhou> 6er
<Dermathil> Or horrible
<Roara|Touhou> 6my

<Roara|Touhou> 6KJRG
<Roara|Touhou> 6RTH
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Light_Latias> 12better yet
<NewDCD> 9I want to give more exposure to giant robot series that don't get enough
<drfsupercenter> 03OK still
<drfsupercenter> 03as I was saying
<Xiagu> ``Set banhammers to kick.''
<Light_Latias> 12BOTH parents
<Sketchy_Sounds> I just momentarily wondered why Fireant was quoting me.
<drfsupercenter> 03there is no perfect solution
<Light_Latias> 12side-by-side
<drfsupercenter> 03for example
<NewDCD> 9Nadesico TV is hilarous, but the movie is pretty contrived
<drfsupercenter> 03you ask who's there and he shoots you before you even get a chance
<FallSilently> Well you are pretty amazing
<CogWeaver> "Set banhammers to KILL"
<Crainy> because he can
<drfsupercenter> 03but does that mean you should just shoot anyone you see?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Well there is that @ Fall
<Crainy> not to ban?
<Roara|Touhou> 6no theres not, I don't like the concept of killing someone
<Dermathil> alright then. Maybe we could Stream Nadesico TV.
<Roara|Touhou> 6I will though if I have to
<NewDCD> 9also Nadesico was made by the same people as Dai-Guard, only it's older
<Light_Latias> 12^
<CogWeaver> no
<Dermathil> hehehe
<CogWeaver> we don't ban here
<CogWeaver> we KILL
<Blums> Whats higher than kill? Crash server?
<Dermathil> also, real robot show.
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd try doing anything that avoids killing them if at all possible
<drfsupercenter> 03like just downing them
<drfsupercenter> 03injuring etc
<NewDCD> 9Gravion or Aquarion
<drfsupercenter> 03so that the police can arrest them for life
<drfsupercenter> 03etc XD
<CogWeaver> no, crashing the server is still lower than killing
<Crainy> a banhammer can crash a server?
<Dermathil> could be cool too
<NewDCD> 9Gundam X is Real Robot
<Sketchy_Sounds> The setting above kill is the one that closes the internet
<drfsupercenter> 03as to most people, spending your life in jail is worse than death
<BitZero> K:Line every single one of you.
<Light_Latias> 12then you're paying to keep them alive
<Light_Latias> 12:B
*Xiagu imagines that on CogWeaver's banhammer, past ``FOREVER'', there is the word KILL written in crayon with one of the Ls backwards
<FallSilently> Man, having this Celestia Radio on in the background is damned trippy.
<drfsupercenter> 03LL we're already paying for prisons
<Dermathil> (I meant that Nadesico was Real robot too)
<CogWeaver> LOL Xiagu
<CogWeaver> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03adding one more person isn't going to change that
<Light_Latias> 12shoot them there
<Fireant> Dudes.
*Sketchy_Sounds lol'd
<Fireant> Topic change.
<Fireant> Ponies.
<Light_Latias> 12you paid for a couple bullets
<FallSilently> It's the same dozen or so songs endlessly remixed.
<Fireant> GO!
<Light_Latias> 12but knowing
<Blums> Frying the 13 DNS routers that service the internet?
<BitZero> Ponies.
<drfsupercenter> 03what are you, cheap now?
<Blums> Ponies?
<Light_Latias> 12that you're helping keep that person alive
<Roara|Touhou> 6they wouldnt get life in jail lol
<FallSilently> Has everybody heard my cat theory?
<CrazyPurple> PONIES! the reason why everybody should be here!
<Crainy> PONIES
<drfsupercenter> 03well yeah not life
<Roara|Touhou> 6intruding is a minimal jail time usually
<Light_Latias> 12for ANY amount of time
<drfsupercenter> 03but they could easily get several years
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Blums> Rarity is best pony. No exceptions
<FallSilently> I would like to propegate it.
<drfsupercenter> 03just breaking in by itself yes
<Dermathil> OH CRAP
<Roara|Touhou> 6if my family's life is threatened in any way
<Crainy> Applejack....
<Roara|Touhou> 6I don't care
<Dermathil> getting bigger than the robot
<drfsupercenter> 03but if they were making an indication of harming someone
<Roara|Touhou> 6I will end theirs
<drfsupercenter> 03that's another crime
<Sketchy_Sounds> I should properly get round to actually drawing Salad.
<abirkin2> fallsilently: is it pro-cat or anti-cat?
<drfsupercenter> 03which is why armed robbery is worse than just normal robbery
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<FallSilently> The ponies aren't ponies. They're cats.
<Light_Latias> 12I agree with Roara
<Sketchy_Sounds> I created her first and yet I drew Sketchy first
<drfsupercenter> 03Light_Latias
<FallSilently> Look at them. Clearly cats.
<drfsupercenter> 03you should see the movie Taken, then
<Blums> So who are the cats then? ponies?
<crono_flash> How about Macross/Robotech?
<abirkin2> ...
<Crainy> Ponies
<Light_Latias> 12I have
<abirkin2> they have hooves
<Sketchy_Sounds> Well OK technically no i drew Salad first but my drawing of her is rubbish.
<drfsupercenter> 03oh
<KalarasOfHaven> I can't decide between Twilight and Fluttershy, myself.
<abirkin2> and horns
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<abirkin2> and manes
<drfsupercenter> 03good movie, no?
<Light_Latias> 12think of this
<FallSilently> They have squarish paws.
<Dermathil> basically, any good robot show we can take.
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<Light_Latias> 12OUR child
<Crainy> and Pinkie Pie
<Blums> Some fan characters rank above some mane 6 for me =D
<Light_Latias> 12we both arise after hearing a noise
<NewDCD> 9gonna stream Do You Remember Love in the first Mech Night
<drfsupercenter> 03make sure it's not Santa on the roof first
*drfsupercenter hides
<Nightseas> 12XD
<FallSilently> Look at their heads, and smooth curves, and snouts.
<drfsupercenter> 03JK
<Blums> by fan i mean background
<abirkin2> their legs and postures are not feline at all
<FallSilently> Very feline.
<Light_Latias> 12we see the above tall dark stranger near her/his door
<NewDCD> 9as the opening show to it
<Dermathil> So that basically eliminates Transformers. and I'm REALLY glad we don't stream that.
<Dermathil> no problem
<drfsupercenter> 03run up with a baseball bat and hit them
<Light_Latias> 12would you let them go in there?
<drfsupercenter> 03before they get a chance to do anything
<NewDCD> 9but no plans of doing Macross TV
<CogWeaver> it is 3:33 over here! DANCE O' CLOCK!!
<Light_Latias> 12which can kill them
<Light_Latias> 12:B
*CogWeaver dances*
<NewDCD> 9maybe Macross Plus
<drfsupercenter> 03it's VERY unlikely
<CogWeaver> ~~EVERYPONY DANCE NOW!~~
<drfsupercenter> 03that it would kill them on first impact
*Psyentific dances
<drfsupercenter> 03unless you continually beat themn with it
<drfsupercenter> 03-n
<crono_flash> cool
<Light_Latias> 12still happens
<FallSilently> The males look more like foxes.
<drfsupercenter> 03still
<Blums> <Sweetie Belle> No. </Sweetie Belle>
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd try to be like Batman about things
<Light_Latias> 12...
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<drfsupercenter> 03try to solve the problem without killing anyone
<Sketchy_Sounds> What kind of crazy-ass foxes have YOU been watching? o-o
<Light_Latias> 12leave the comic book crap
<drfsupercenter> 03no but
<Skylands> 10Living in a fantasy world, lulz
*^Stargazer dances and just falls over, decides to stay put
<Light_Latias> 12out of a serious debate
<Roara|Touhou> 6drfsupercenter	which is why armed robbery is worse than just normal robbery <-HOW CAN YOU TELL LOL
<Blums> Rita ofc
<drfsupercenter> 03Roara|Touhou
<Xiagu> It just sunshowered outside
<crono_flash> agreed dermathil
<drfsupercenter> 03if you hit someone with a bat or shoot them in the foot etc
<Dermathil> confirmation of no Transformers, right NewDCD?
<drfsupercenter> 03and police come
<FallSilently> Ones that have been told by an evil horse queen that they're ponies!
<Nightseas> 12I actually agree with drf there
<Blums> Sunshowers are pretty
<drfsupercenter> 03and find a gun on the person
<Roara|Touhou> 6"Hey, intruder? Do you have a knife? A gun? Are you just going to walk into my kid's room?
<drfsupercenter> 03then you can tell :P
<NewDCD> 9not really
<Blums> once the entire sky glowed orange
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Dermathil> oh snap
<NewDCD> 9I might stream GOOD Transformers eventually
<drfsupercenter> 03you can't tell beforehand no
<NewDCD> 9like Beast Wars
<Dermathil> yeah
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm not giving them the chance
<Dermathil> good transformers ia okay
<Light_Latias> 12^
<A> What?
<Dermathil> but bad is HORRIBLE
<drfsupercenter> 03but given how the legal system works if you just shoot them without even finding out if they have a weapon there's a good chance you'll get sued for everything you own in court
<drfsupercenter> 03by their relatives
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<Light_Latias> 12call it paranoia
<A> I didn't write "A".
<Skylands> 10Why does it matter if they have a weapon or not anyway? They're still intruding
<Light_Latias> 12but
<Roara|Touhou> 6by the time I find out, it could be because they've actually SHOT me, my husband, or my kid
<CrazyPurple> yay
<Light_Latias> 12safe than sorry
<Dermathil> they're like the G1-3.5 Ponies.
<Blums> If season two has a main antagonist it should be Bad Horse
<FallSilently> You can't do spaces in your user name
<Light_Latias> 12always go hand in hand with chilkdren
<drfsupercenter> 03Skylands, it doesn't, i'm just saying armed robbery is a worse crime
<Sketchy_Sounds> If you put in a space after the A, IRC doesn't care.
<Light_Latias> 12-k
<drfsupercenter> 03and will give more jailtime XD
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03LL
<Psyentific> Bad Horse/
<Skylands> 10Well
<drfsupercenter> 03comic books aside
<Xiagu> according to my research, ~7 species of animals just got married
<CrazyPurple> hey fluttershy! show me your best cheer!
<Psyentific> Bad Horse!
<drfsupercenter> 03just because someone has a gun
<drfsupercenter> 03does not mean shooting them is the only solution
<Black> Ah,thanks for clarifying.
<Psyentific> He rides across the nation, a throughbred of sin!
<CrystalWalrein> Oh hey. o.o
<Psyentific> He got the application that you just sent in!
<drfsupercenter> 03if you're fast enough you can smack the gun out of their hand before they get a chance to use it
<Blums> someone did a pmv of that letter-song
<Dashite> Question. What is considered bad Transformers?
<Light_Latias> 12it's the best if they're an unwanted gues at 2am near your child's room
<drfsupercenter> 03then point their own gun at them :P
<Roara|Touhou> 6ok
<Nightseas> 12Also, you don't have to kill them with your gun
<BlackAlicorn> That's better.:D
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm not fast enough
<Psyentific> ...
<Light_Latias> 12fast enough
<Sketchy_Sounds> If you want a space, use an underscore instead.
<Psyentific> Link it nao
<Roara|Touhou> 6and I'm not strong
<Light_Latias> 12if they're armed
<Roara|Touhou> 6I have the gun
<Roara|Touhou> 6I shoot
<Blums> ok ill find it
<Light_Latias> 12^
<Barry> This might seem odd, but I went looking for a MLP music video using the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers theme song
<drfsupercenter> 03in that case I would too, but I'd shoot them somewhere that wouldn't kill them
<Light_Latias> 12going by your rules, Danny
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Pattyrick10) 11WB10»11•. 10- [11:31] <Pattyrick> Yup, but since ArcaninOMGPONIESPOOOONNNIIIIEESS
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm not aiming
<CrazyPurple> spaaaace!?
<NewDCD> 9Dashite: Stuff like Transformers: Cybertron
<drfsupercenter> 03then good luck hitting them
<Roara|Touhou> 6if I kill or dont, I don't care
<Light_Latias> 12it's like in Indiana Jones 4
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm shooting
<Blums> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP3CwPLl9Mo
<crono_flash> I consider Transformers: Energon bad
<Roara|Touhou> 6well
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'd aim enough to hit them
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<NewDCD> 9that
<Light_Latias> 12"looks like you brought a knife to a gunfight"
<drfsupercenter> 03OK well then aim enough to not kill them :P
<Dermathil> yeah, the Cybertron and Energons were bad.
<Roara|Touhou> 6you do know it's easier to hit the chest than the foot right?
<Xiagu> I think there are PMVs for most of Dr. Horrible's songs
<Dashite> Okay, just checking.
<Dermathil> And they were basically among the only transformers I've ever watched.
<drfsupercenter> 03yes, but say you shoot them in the stomach
<drfsupercenter> 03that's just as easy to hit
<Blums> actual song starts at :40
<drfsupercenter> 03that'll knock them over but not kill them
<drfsupercenter> 03usually
<Light_Latias> 12can easily kill them tho
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<ValtheJean> howdy gents
<drfsupercenter> 03depends on how much blood they lose LOL
<Light_Latias> 12stomach acid
<Dermathil> Ohai Val
<Light_Latias> 12is HIGHLY acidic
<Nightseas> 12You shoot someone in there foot or somewhere like that, they're going act like you killed them, so in reality, there’s no need to kill them :p
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm aware
<NewDCD> 9sup Val
<Roara|Touhou> 6hey
<ValtheJean> howdy derma

<Roara|Touhou> 6then ok
<ValtheJean> ohai NewDcd
<prince-dari> Why'd he kill it?
<Dermathil> you going back to #P&D right?
<Roara|Touhou> 6they survive, I dont have to kill them
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03Light_Latias
<NewDCD> 9yeah I was wondering the same thing dari LOL
<crono_flash> Yo Val
<drfsupercenter> 03are you telling me
<drfsupercenter> 03that once we have a kid
<Roara|Touhou> 6but that will perfectly imobilize them
<drfsupercenter> 03you're going to keep a gun in our house?
<Nightseas> 12That would kill you, Roara |D
<Dermathil> dari, too big to recover.
<ValtheJean> hello crono_flash
<Roara|Touhou> 6how?
<Light_Latias> 12maybe
<drfsupercenter> 03:|
<Nightseas> 12Think about it lol
<Roara|Touhou> 6how would shooting them in the stomach kill them?
<Roara|Touhou> 6er
<Roara|Touhou> 6kill me
<drfsupercenter> 03and then that awkward moment when our 3 year old finds the gun and kills himself with it
<Light_Latias> 12safety lock
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<Light_Latias> 12:B
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'd keep mine safet-
<drfsupercenter> 03LL
<drfsupercenter> 03you know childproof medicine?
<drfsupercenter> 03that's really adult-proof? :P
<drfsupercenter> 03Children are smarter than you think
<drfsupercenter> 03it's like
<Dermathil> happy justice is happy
<Skylands> 10Lock combination
<Nightseas> 12I'd rather aim for the leg or arm to play it safe
<drfsupercenter> 03having a button that says do not press, everyone's going to press it, right?
<Light_Latias> 12then we can go the honest route
<Skylands> 10Like they could figure that out
<NewDCD> 9oh right
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03they could guess
<Light_Latias> 12which is YOUR preferred method
<Skylands> 10I don't think they would
<Roara|Touhou> 6safety lock isn't a button lol
<Roara|Touhou> 6GUESS LOL
<drfsupercenter> 03no
<drfsupercenter> 03but I mean
<Skylands> 10and if you kept the safe somewhere unnoticeable
<drfsupercenter> 03Skylands
<Roara|Touhou> 6 4 number lock, the kid guesses and gets it
<drfsupercenter> 03if you keep it somewhere unnoticeable
<Dermathil> currently cooking pasta
<drfsupercenter> 03then good luck pulling it out at a moment's notice
<Dermathil> well, heating water
<Light_Latias> 12Roara
<Pattyrick> I got the adapter today, drf
<Light_Latias> 12if thats the case
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm starting to get hungry
<Roara|Touhou> 6nightstand drawer, under a couple papers
<NewDCD> 9Also guys
<Barry> Just out of curiosity, what episode were the original zords destroyed in?
<Light_Latias> 12that child's a genius
<drfsupercenter> 03Roara|Touhou, usually people use personal stuff as passwords
<Skylands> 10That's why you keep one-
<Roara|Touhou> 6 5 seconds to open it and take the gun out
<Skylands> 10[16:40] <Roara|Touhou> nightstand drawer, under a couple papers
<Skylands> 10That
<NewDCD> 9I'm going to try to stream all of Dai-Guard during the week
<Dermathil> Question: if the heterodyne made the South pole melt, HOW DID JAPAN NOT GET FLOODED
<Light_Latias> 12^
<Roara|Touhou> 6I've done it
<Dermathil> alright, NewDCD.
<Barry> magic
<Skylands> 10There are drawers that can be locked BTW
<Roara|Touhou> 6not with a gun, but I've done a similar task
<Pattyrick> Thanks for sending it to me! =D
<drfsupercenter> 03yes I know
<Blums> "Brand new day" "everyones a hero" "slipping" "my eyes" "so they say" and the end song havent been done I think
<drfsupercenter> 03Pattyrick, no problem
<Light_Latias> 12Sky
<NewDCD> 9I'll start it on the Mech Nights much later
<drfsupercenter> 03did it work?
<Roara|Touhou> 6locked drawers tend to be a problem
<Dermathil> no problem
<Roara|Touhou> 6but yeh
<Light_Latias> 12making it hard for the owner to access is
<NewDCD> 9as in, when we finish another, unwatched show
<Skylands> 10I know
<Light_Latias> 12counterproductive
<Skylands> 10But for when the kid is around
<Pattyrick> Let me try it out now
<Dermathil> Gurren, for example?
<Light_Latias> 12well, yah
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway Roara|Touhou all I'm saying is, if you use a combination lock, and you use something personal, if the kid knows what your birthday or anniversary is... LOL
<Blums> nvm sliping is done
<Dermathil> or something else like Gundam X?
<Nightseas> 12Kids think guns taste good :p
<Skylands> 10Anyway
<ValtheJean> O_o do you take requests for shows to stream?
<Skylands> 10If your kid is going through your guys' stuff
<drfsupercenter> 03still
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd just say
<NewDCD> 9something like that
<drfsupercenter> 03no guns in the house
<NewDCD> 9well I take suggestions
<drfsupercenter> 03end of discussion
<Light_Latias> 12Danny
<Skylands> 10You guys aren't looking after your child very well
<Dermathil> BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
<Light_Latias> 12locks
<Light_Latias> 12and discipline
<Light_Latias> 12work wonders
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Light_Latias> 12the latter especially
<drfsupercenter> 03fine, maybe they won't find it when they're 3
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<ValtheJean> iiiiiiinteresting
<prince-dari> By the way was it you I was talking to about GunZ Dermathil?
<drfsupercenter> 03say they're an angry teenager
<Dermathil> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03they know you have a gun somewhere
<drfsupercenter> 03we leave the house for 10 minutes
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<Dermathil> it was me
<prince-dari> Thought so.
<Roara|Touhou> 6by the time the child is able to get into that drawer and potentially open the lock, it should be an age that it should learn not to
<Nightseas> 12Creepy .-.
<Light_Latias> 12tangent, Danny
<Skylands> 10So you don't trust your child?
<Dermathil> is there a problem?
<drfsupercenter> 03if I had a gun in my house? I wouldn't even trust my best friend
<Light_Latias> 12besides
<Dermathil> BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
<Nightseas> 12Sometimes you can't lol
<Pattyrick> It does seem to work
<Dermathil> BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA BA
<Roara|Touhou> 6if it's an angry teenager, then well, that's probably a time to remove the gun lol
<drfsupercenter> 03Told you XD
<Light_Latias> 12if we discipline the child right
<Crainy> ok
<ValtheJean> I like how it has subtitles for "bararara"
<Crainy> im gonna watch some MLP now
<drfsupercenter> 03that's the big if
<Light_Latias> 12violence shouldn't even be a concern
<Crainy> what Episode shall i watch?
<prince-dari> Not sure if you can stream fullscreen games.
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<Light_Latias> 12same @u
<Black_Alicorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si-7SCxdWgg&feature=related.
<drfsupercenter> 03kids like the ones who shot up Columbine
<Blums> every. single. one
<Dermathil> eh
<drfsupercenter> 03do you think their parents knew they were going to steal their guns?
<NewDCD> 9you can on Livestream
<drfsupercenter> 03prolly not
<prince-dari> I did make it windowed, but it crashes when you do.
<NewDCD> 9but not really on Veemi
<Light_Latias> 12I have a counter
<drfsupercenter> 03they just acted like typical shy teenagers
<Crainy> only one for today
<Pattyrick> Yup, it does
<Light_Latias> 12did the parents bring them up right?
<Light_Latias> 12prolly not
<drfsupercenter> 03maybe, maybe not
<drfsupercenter> 03I mean
<drfsupercenter> 03this is one of those things
<Light_Latias> 12just as you said
<drfsupercenter> 03if you try to teach a kid
<drfsupercenter> 03that guns are bad
<drfsupercenter> 03then they'll go
<drfsupercenter> 03"Then why do you have one"
<drfsupercenter> 03what are you going to say to that LOL
<ValtheJean> bitch just got legally pwned
<MrPoniator> Ponychan 502-ing on any of you?
<Roara|Touhou> 6um
<prince-dari> You could run a stream on Veemi of the stream on Livestream. XD
<Dermathil> UST
<Nightseas> 12Ii's not a risk you should take no matter how good your kids are
<Blums> Oh. Show stoppers =D
<Roara|Touhou> 6probably the same thing we just had an hour discussion talking about LOL
<Nightseas> 12it's*
<Light_Latias> 12^
<prince-dari> Does livestream have a viewer limit or something?
<Roara|Touhou> 6guns for defense, not offense
<drfsupercenter> 03Nightseas, agreed
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> 50
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<prince-dari> Wow.
<drfsupercenter> 03that sounds good on paper
<NewDCD> 9unless you pay or somehow
<prince-dari> That's poor.
<Light_Latias> 12teach your child self-discipline
<Light_Latias> 12and defense
<Dermathil> that's for free accounts
<drfsupercenter> 03but teenagers are easily stupid
<NewDCD> 9get approved by Livestream
<Roara|Touhou> 6the people who go out there offensively shooting, god have mercy on their soul because they should die themselves
<drfsupercenter> 03and could think they're doing the right thing
<drfsupercenter> 03like
<Light_Latias> 12karate helps ironically enough
<ValtheJean> though to be fair
<NewDCD> 9but out of all the people that have applied for verification have failed
<NewDCD> 9myself included
<Dermathil> then there's the small pay account I think with limit 150
<Pattyrick> D=
<drfsupercenter> 03"Oh, someone bullied me, I'm just giving them what they deserve"
<Xiagu> That's not the sound a bear makes!
<ValtheJean> the non-main bmn streams usually don't have more than 20-30 people
<NewDCD> 9it was fair back in the day, but now for me it's a lot
<drfsupercenter> 03some would see that as defensive LOL
<Light_Latias> 12again
<Light_Latias> 12no
<Pattyrick> I hate my generation, tbh
<NewDCD> 9it's too little, I mean
<Light_Latias> 12that's extreme
<NewDCD> 9I derped
<Light_Latias> 12which
<drfsupercenter> 03it would be extreme if it only happened once
<Light_Latias> 12we would teach them not to do
<Nightseas> 12Because sometimes your kids might not be in there right mind
<drfsupercenter> 03but you know how many school shootings there have been?
<drfsupercenter> 03Light_Latias
<drfsupercenter> 03my mom taught me not to lie
<drfsupercenter> 03you know how much I have to
<drfsupercenter> 03>_>
<Dermathil> Well, I know that what you can do is a streamception to get more viewers.
<Pattyrick> So many weird things wrong with us it seems
<Light_Latias> 12so did mine
<drfsupercenter> 03<Nightseas> Because sometimes your kids might not be in there right mind <- this
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah, LL, and yet you lie to them
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<Light_Latias> 12yes
<drfsupercenter> 03so
<prince-dari> How do you get verification then? O_o
<drfsupercenter> 03we can teach our kids all we want
<drfsupercenter> 03does that mean they're going to follow it?
<drfsupercenter> 03Absolutely not
<Light_Latias> 12no
<Light_Latias> 12but
<NewDCD> 9it's an application
<NewDCD> 9and then Livestream reviews it
<Dermathil> TheOtakuAscended did that with BronyComms when they had more than 50 viewers for their Back to the Future stream
<Solarstorm> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJINiK9azc o.O DO WANT!!!
<drfsupercenter> 03so let's just make this easy on ourselves and not have a gun LOL
<Light_Latias> 12it's not for our lack of trying
<Light_Latias> 12just your genes
*Light_Latias HIDES
<drfsupercenter> 03wtf?
<Dermathil> (they had 49 normal viewers and 50th was Bronycomms who was streaming their stream
<Dermathil> with 20 people in there
<NewDCD> 9and then you get a notification whether it's
<NewDCD> 9approved or fail
<prince-dari> But how do they decide whether to approve it or not?
<Light_Latias> 12I was joking lol
<funkydalek> Wassup
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03still
<drfsupercenter> 03I'm getting tired of this debate LOL
<NewDCD> 9nobody knows
<prince-dari> O_o
<FallSilently> Hello.
<Skylands> 10Let's end it now?
<drfsupercenter> 03I'd figure you would agree with me that having a gun in our house would be bad :P
<drfsupercenter> 03@ LL
<Light_Latias> 12it IS bad
<FallSilently> Not sure what's up.
<drfsupercenter> 03so why do it
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHA
<Light_Latias> 12I'm not disagreeing
<funkydalek> how is everypony?
<drfsupercenter> 03there are other ways to defend yourself
<drfsupercenter> 03heck
<FallSilently> T'was busy a moment ago.
<drfsupercenter> 03get some pepper spray
*drfsupercenter runs
<funkydalek> oh
<drfsupercenter> 03that works from a distance
<Light_Latias> 12for the safety of our family
<funkydalek> came at the wrong time :D
<drfsupercenter> 03or even a taser
<FallSilently> Then I looked away for a bit, and it seems everybody else did, too.
<prince-dari> $350 per month
<Roara|Touhou> 6so I can go onto actually playing my game
<drfsupercenter> 03I've seen sites selling tasers for $10
<Skylands> 10Pepper spray
<prince-dari> O_____________________________________________________o
<Roara|Touhou> 6I'm giong to sum up my points
<Dermathil> EEYUP
<Skylands> 10Pfft
<ValtheJean> horry sheeeet
<Light_Latias> 12old skool
<prince-dari> Who actually PAYS for livestream?
<FallSilently> Nah, I just have a lot of influence around here.
<prince-dari> What the hell.
<Dermathil> that's why I prefer justin.tv NO fee
<drfsupercenter> 03what's old school, pepper spray?
<Skylands> 10While it's a handy thing to carry around
<NewDCD> 9approvals will give you unlimited viewer limit without having to pay anything though
<Sketchy_Sounds> I just went to switch my fryer on.
*Nightseas uses Pepper spray on everyone in chat
<drfsupercenter> 03but yeah, actually, tasers are probably a lot more ideal for home defense
<Skylands> 10I wouldn't rely on pepper spray these days
<FallSilently> People didn't want to say anything if there wasn't any chance that I'd notice them.
<Dermathil> (hell, there are streams with 10K+ viewers)
<NewDCD> 9Justin.tv's streaming applications suck dick
<Nightseas> 12:3
<funkydalek> hehehe
<drfsupercenter> 03useless for lots of people
<Skylands> 10Someone could knock you out before you can spray them
<NewDCD> 9that's why I use Veemi
<funkydalek> WHAT ARE YOU FRYING!!!!
<drfsupercenter> 03but if it's just one person
<drfsupercenter> 03it'll work
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<NewDCD> 9best quality, no viewer limit, and the chat can be transferred to IRC
<Dermathil> yeah, but I think Jtv is the most used
<ValtheJean> I imagine the approvals are based on a) how likely you are to purchase if the application fails and b) how likely this stream will be used for marketting exploits
<Sketchy_Sounds> I'm gonna fry chips.
<funkydalek> :D
<funkydalek> can i have some?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Or fries, for the anglicaly challenged.
<Nightseas> 12I’d just use a high power pellet gun lol
<FallSilently> So. Rarity is best cat.
<NewDCD> 9AOYAMA WISHES TO FORNICATE
<drfsupercenter> 03eh
<funkydalek> nah I be from good old blighty
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate airsoft guns
<Dermathil> EEYUP
*^Stargazer yawns
<Roara|Touhou> 6-I don't have a problem with owning a gun in the house. I don't like the concept, but I'd rather not have my family harmed. I just as easily use the baseball bat I ALREADY HAVE, but if my husband wants one in the house for defense, Im ok with it
<drfsupercenter> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<drfsupercenter> 03one of my IRL friends almost lost his eye to one of those
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh awesome
<drfsupercenter> 03because he and a friend were goofing around and he got shot in the eye
<Blums> wrong. Twilight is best cat
<funkydalek> be you too?
<Dermathil> HAHAHA
<ValtheJean> why is it that the main character in these shows is always a complete bafoon?
<^Stargazer> I'm a little tired, I need to make sure this pony hits the hay early tonight lol
<Sketchy_Sounds> Which part? Scots Brony here.
<FallSilently> Then you may continue to call them chips.
<Nightseas> 12lol
<NewDCD> 9>Akagi
<Dermathil> It needs to have a comical component.
<funkydalek> South west
<NewDCD> 9>Buffoon
<NewDCD> 9he's pretty badass
<Solarstorm> gn8
<Nightseas> 12That seems to happen a LOT
<FallSilently> See yah
<Light_Latias> 12that goes back to bad parenting
<ValtheJean> yeah, but he's also oblivious
<drfsupercenter> 03LL
<NewDCD> 9also because people like those got more heart than normal
<drfsupercenter> 03bad parenting on his FRIEND'S parents
<drfsupercenter> 03not HIS
<Skylands> 10That goes back to irresponsible people owning guns, rather
<ValtheJean> I'm not doubting his "skills" or anything
<drfsupercenter> 03heck
<Light_Latias> 12and his
<drfsupercenter> 03it wasn't even his gun
<drfsupercenter> 03he went over to a friend
<Dermathil> they don't use brains.
<drfsupercenter> 03*Friend's house
<drfsupercenter> 03and friend goes "hey, check this out"
<ValtheJean> it's just what I observe to be the "Goku" effect
<Dermathil> they just want to do the right hting
<Nightseas> 12You can't blame the parents for everything there kid does :p
<drfsupercenter> 03and next thing you know
<NewDCD> 9and heart is everything you need for piloting a super
<funkydalek> pommes frites
<drfsupercenter> 03he gets shot in the eye
<Light_Latias> 12then it's BAD PARENTING
<drfsupercenter> 03LL
<ValtheJean> >incredibly talented, so intelligence is used as a hamper
<Dermathil> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03Not on my friend's parents though
<NewDCD> 9I mean, he isn't a Real, y'know
<Light_Latias> 12I didn't say whose
<drfsupercenter> 03how should he have known that his friend had an airsoft gun?
<drfsupercenter> 03OK
<drfsupercenter> 03then sure
<drfsupercenter> 03but
<drfsupercenter> 03my point being
<drfsupercenter> 03that I hate airsoft guns
<Light_Latias> 12o...k?
<drfsupercenter> 03because I know someone who almost lost their vision due to one
<drfsupercenter> 03is that not a valid reason?
<Light_Latias> 12no
<nickstr> I would say its valid
<Blums> too much german
<Light_Latias> 12because if they had been taught right
<drfsupercenter> 03and really, that comment was aimed at Nightseas
<Sketchy_Sounds> Convo with my friend
<Dermathil> Yeah.
<drfsupercenter> 03<Nightseas> I’d just use a high power pellet gun lol
<drfsupercenter> 03it was in response to that
<Dermathil> Dai-Guard has the body of a real, but the soul of a super.
<nickstr> idiot+gun=disaster
<NewDCD> 9also Akagi isn't stupid, like Goku
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03LL
<drfsupercenter> 03The thing about airsoft guns
<drfsupercenter> 03is that they're marketed as being toys
<NewDCD> 9he's just sort of naive
<funkydalek> Koennen wir jetzt Deutsch sprechen!!
<NewDCD> 9and straight-forward
<Sketchy_Sounds> Me: I think I've not gotten this stuck into a fanbase since the time of my originally getting stuck into Sonic stuff. Friend: Hah, you'll never escape now Me: imokwiththis.jpg
<drfsupercenter> 03so parents who might not be the most educated
<NewDCD> 9but he's actually pretty smart
<drfsupercenter> 03might buy one for their kids thinking it's like a nerf gun
<NewDCD> 9OH SHIT IT'S THAT ONE ANGEL FROM EVA
<ValtheJean> well I would say goku is portrayed the same way
<Light_Latias> 12BAD
<Light_Latias> 12PARENTING
<drfsupercenter> 03Light_Latias
<Dermathil> Wuh?
<funkydalek> hehehe
<Light_Latias> 12must I repeat it 50 times?
<drfsupercenter> 03are you going to research every single thing you ever buy for anyone?
<Dermathil> there's an angel in evangelion that's that shape?
<NewDCD> 9SORTA
<Skylands> 10How many times does LL have to repeat hersel- yeah
<Skylands> 10Hiveminds, I should shut up now
<Light_Latias> 12if it's something like that'
<Light_Latias> 12then yes
<ValtheJean> it's the ditzyness =/= stupid debate basically
<NewDCD> 9dat tech
<drfsupercenter> 03if anything it's sketchy marketing at the people who make the guns who make it look like it's a children's toy >_>
<FallSilently> I've never been this stuck in a fanbase.
<Dermathil> DEM 3 EYES
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Psyentific> Does anyone know any mods I could use to Ponify Fallout NV?
<drfsupercenter> 03you'd buy a Nerf gun, right?
<drfsupercenter> 03if someone asked for one?
<Light_Latias> 12there's prolly safety tags?
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<drfsupercenter> 03it says something like
<NewDCD> 9I'D WRECK THAT
<Sketchy_Sounds> tbh I don't think I was this stuck into Sonic as I am MLP.
<NewDCD> 9WITH A DAI-GUARD ROCKET PUNCH
<drfsupercenter> 0313 and up
<Dermathil> hahaha
<Dermathil> yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03the kid was 15
<drfsupercenter> 03etc
<Dermathil> also, SPEARFISTO
<funkydalek> i used to be an avid hoosiers fan
<Light_Latias> 12things like those
<Light_Latias> 12have caution signs
<funkydalek> still like em tbh
<drfsupercenter> 03not all the time
<FallSilently> I also followed Sonic, on a site called Green Hill Zone.
<Dermathil> SHIELDED
<drfsupercenter> 03depends on who makes it LOL
<funkydalek> but im more ponies now
<Light_Latias> 12ones that can cause damage like that
<Blums> Sonic just isnt relateable or likeable
<drfsupercenter> 03if it's some random Chinese company
<Sketchy_Sounds> Though I could be wrong, I was pretty stuck in when I was younger.
<drfsupercenter> 03they can get away with crap
<drfsupercenter> 03you'd be surprised
<Light_Latias> 12thats when you either test it
<Light_Latias> 12or warn your child
<drfsupercenter> 03OK well
<Sketchy_Sounds> And likewise here.
<drfsupercenter> 03all I'm saying is
*HyperMetalLugia reads
<Nightseas> 12I read Nerf gun as durf
<drfsupercenter> 03my friend almost lost an eye to that
<Light_Latias> 12Hyper
<drfsupercenter> 03end of discussion
<FallSilently> I think GHZ is still around but I haven't visited in years.
<Light_Latias> 12you'll be there for a while XD
<Sketchy_Sounds> It is
<Light_Latias> 12yes
<nickstr> I have a similar story
<HyperMetalLugia> I just finished catching up :P
<drfsupercenter> 03I've seen Judge Judy cases too
<Sketchy_Sounds> Did you ever visit Sonic HQ and its Mobius Forum, by the way?
<funkydalek> ooohh, who was your first crush/
<drfsupercenter> 03someone was trying to sue a friend for breaking their TV with an airsoft gun
<nickstr> my black lab nearly lost his eye due to a BB gun
<funkydalek> mine was pingu
*Skylands yawns
<drfsupercenter> 03and she was like, you're stupid if it's YOUR gun and in YOUR house
<nickstr> again the idiot+gun thing
<FallSilently> I may have but I probably didn't sign up.
<^Stargazer> what's wrong with sonic? =/
<Skylands> 10Now we're just arguing to argue
<HyperMetalLugia> Skylands is just boring :P
<drfsupercenter> 03OK

<FallSilently> Or I shall have to assume malevolence
<Psyentific> Except when it's shit.
<Pyroh> Or a fanfic is this situation
<CogWeaver> language...
<Crainy> language?
<funkydalek> lol, failsilently is quite ood i thought
<SilverMane> it's on the top of EQD
<Sketchy_Sounds> Most ponyfics I've read have been good.
<FallSilently> And counterattack accordingly

<Pyroh> Seenging Paipes >:L
<FallSilently> You gotta stop hitting Enter in between words, dude, it makes you very difficult to follow.
<Blums> is that a meme or just something to do?
<Polarfire> I get this: * #P&D :You must be a channel half-operator
<Blums> *you
<Crainy> i just like doing it
<prince-dari> Hm
<prince-dari> Half op
<prince-dari> Dunno then
<FallSilently> ...yeah, but the point still stands
<MrPoniator> That was the most dissappointing Optimus vs Megatron, Crainy
<Blums> Well maybe you can enjoy your transformers... *whispers* on the moon
<Crainy> well
<prince-dari> You still haven't registered the channel. :P
<Crainy> i guess

<Light_Latias> 12she put a toothpick in my cake
<Light_Latias> 12._.
<Roara|Touhou> 6chose a fairly normal stage for you to watch
<Polarfire> somebody needs to
<Crainy> why?
<funkydalek> nomnom
<Roara|Touhou> 6since it's way to easy for me to link to some godawfully hard level
<HyperMetalLugia> The cake is a lie
<Blums> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/43231 <-- thats probably going to end up on today's drawfriend
<funkydalek> he was already n the moon
<prince-dari> Stream's up.
<MrPoniator> Or better yet, the writers for the second and third movie
<Crainy> ah lol
<Crainy> yeah
<FallSilently> If I explain why the fish was flung it will defeat the purpose of flinging the flung fish.
<Crainy> he was already on the moon
<Polarfire> Woooo!!!
<prince-dari> Ok.
<prince-dari> Let's see how much this lags me. XD
<Winter-puff> kitty
<ValtheJean> KITTIES
<Crainy> for an action movie, the script for the third one was actually really good
<funkydalek> I did ated the fish already
<funkydalek> was it for something important, im sorry
<CogWeaver> fish?
<CogWeaver> FISH??
<Pegacorn> Ohai GunZ.
<funkydalek> FEEESH!!
<Pattyrick> so I'd guess stage 2 is pretty easy?
<Blums> Now that I finally have you two where I want you... *maniac face*
<Blums> *normal face* I'd like to buy all your fish
<Roara|Touhou> 6well to state the obvious: you play on one of 4 difficulties, and there are 6 stages in each (5 for the easiest difficulty)
<Roara|Touhou> 6and each stage gets more difficult
<Pattyrick> ok
<prince-dari> Just to check
<Roara|Touhou> 6but yeah, general rule of thumb:
<funkydalek> IM SORRY I DID EAT IT!!!
<prince-dari> Can you guys actually see the game?
<prince-dari> XD
<CogWeaver> I wish for a fish on a dish that's delish with relish in a quiche that goes squish!
<Nick> hey Lati
<Larscis> My goldfish can neither be bought nor sold. Mostly because it gave up being solid matter long ago.
<MrPoniator> But for a Transformers movie, only the first one really felt like something
<ValtheJean> *trollface* nope
<Winter-puff> yes we could
<prince-dari> :P
<Nick> how's things?
<funkydalek> (im sorry failsilintly, i also failed)
<HyperMetalLugia> WB Lati
<Polarfire> what size is your monitor dari?
*FallSilently 's name is FALL
<funkydalek> yeh i know, its just funny, hehe
<Roara|Touhou> 6stage 1- ridiculously easy, stage 2- easy with an annoying boss, stage 3- picking up difficulty, a somewhat challenging boss, stage 4- SO MANY BULLETS, stage 5- usually the hardest boss in the game, stage 6- still a very hard to beat boss
<prince-dari> 1920x1240 or something is my current resolution.
<ValtheJean> so technically
*FallSilently forgets what happens after that bit in the Matrix, but does it anyway
<prince-dari> Can't remember exactly
<Roara|Touhou> 6and it follows that pattern through the games
<FallSilently> Oh yeah.
<ValtheJean> you wont be able to read the chatlog while playing
<ValtheJean> >: D
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> :P
<Psyentific> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1My_lYEYDb1xR4dFYFnFZbCRKJMJa_ILI_qBHEVWi02Y/edit?hl=en_US
<Psyentific> Wow.
*FallSilently squashes funky under a train
<Polarfire> D:
<Psyentific> This is pretty good.
<Pattyrick> hmmm
<ValtheJean> *malicious snicker*
<Roara|Touhou> 6with the exception of the 10th game, where the 6th boss EASILY outranks the 5th....but a god amount (literally)
<Polarfire> <.<
<Polarfire> >.>
<Dermathil> no sound?
<funkydalek> nice t know im on track with all this
<Pyroh> BRB

<Soital> 12!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Soital, you are a 6Illumise.
<Roara|Touhou> 6I hate that card
<Larscis> Internationally, it's Lazy Day, but in the US, it's National S'mores Day.
<Soital> 12=o
<Roara|Touhou> 6but honest man death gave me SO MUCH TROUBLE
<Roara|Touhou> 6!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Roara|Touhou, you are a 14Skarmory.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Honest Man's Death isn't that bad once you get used to it xD
<Roara|Touhou> 6ok
<Roara|Touhou> 6yeah
<Angel_Espeon> 13I used to hate it, now it's kinda fun xD
<Blums> theres an international lazy day?
<Roara|Touhou> 6but it's still annoying lol
<Larscis> Apparently
<Roara|Touhou> 6it's like Cirno's non spells
<Roara|Touhou> 6easy
<Dermathil> maybe closing skype?
<Roara|Touhou> 6BUT FFS THEY'RE ANNOYING
<Pattyrick> How many bullets can you be hit by without dieing?
<Pegacorn> YES!YES!
<Roara|Touhou> 6once you get hit
<funkydalek> sounds good Rra
<Roara|Touhou> 6you lose a life
<Roara|Touhou> 6you have 4 lives
<FallSilently> I was going to tell you, but meh, couldn't be bothered.
<Sketch> Sounds relaxing
<Nightseas> 12Hi Lati :3
<Winter-puff> my god we can see whats going on
<Roara|Touhou> 6but can gain lives through points and picking up lives from the 3rd and 5th midbosses
<funkydalek> hehe, i see what you did thar
<Blums> Imagine if all these holidays counted as statutory holidays
<ValtheJean> it's a miracle!
<Angel_Espeon> 13Deathbombing always makes you feel like a pro
<Blums> Nothing would get done.
<Roara|Touhou> 6^
<Blums> Ever.
<Dermathil> dat sneak attack
<Ray||Minecraft> 02^
<prince-dari> This is impossible.
<Roara|Touhou> 6deathbombing makes you feel like a pro
<Pattyrick> !pokemon
<Sketchy_Sounds> So it'd be like how things are anyway
<Dermathil> Dari, close Skype.
<ScriptBot> Pattyrick, you are a 5Croconaw.
<Roara|Touhou> 6but you know what's better?
<funkydalek> sounds guud
<Roara|Touhou> 6NINJAING THE BULLETS AND LASERS
<Sketch> Also sounds relaxing
<Larscis> The 18th might not be a good one for Equestria Daily. August 18 is Bad Poetry Day.
<Ray||Minecraft> 02^
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL YES
<Dermathil> You don't really need it now do you?
<Blums> Yeah but at least people pretend
<Roara|Touhou> 6"OH GOD I'M GONNA DIE NOOOOOOO- I went right though that crap without knowing what i was doing"
<Angel_Espeon> 13I swear I got hit in Mokou's last spellcard like 3 times
<Angel_Espeon> 13but I apparently survived them all
<Angel_Espeon> 13It was great |D
<Roara|Touhou> 6lol yeah
<funkydalek> HEY, lets make a poem NOAW!!
<Ray> 02I got hitted at least 5, lol\
<prince-dari> Hmm.
<Roara|Touhou> 6her hitboxes are weird
<Roara|Touhou> 6speaking of weird hitboxes
<prince-dari> This'd be so much easier if the game had a windowed mode.
<prince-dari> >_>
<Roara|Touhou> 6YUYUKO AND MARISA ANYONE? LOLOLOL
<Pattyrick> Naawww
*Roara|Touhou 6runs
<Ray> 02and the extra spell of mokuo. :<
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Blums> "Shall I compare thee to a summer's pickle?"
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yuyuko's butterflies
<Drake> 04Play any monster Hunter before MH3 and wonder what the hell the designers were thinking with hitboxes.
<Roara|Touhou> 6oh god last words
<Pegacorn> Dat stream
<Ray> 02got to the half of it
<Larscis> August 28th is the anti-Fluttershy holiday with Race Your Mouse Day.
<Drake> 04Or just hunt a Plesioth with Dual Swords. Pain incarnate.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I remember panicking and charging straight through a bunch of bullets
<Roara|Touhou> 6last word cards
<Roara|Touhou> 6are
<Angel_Espeon> 13and survived
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Roara|Touhou> 6amazingly horrible
<funkydalek> oh gosh, whats a sonnets rhyme scheme again???
<MrPoniator> That's a day I refuse to accept
<Roara|Touhou> 6angel, I love doing that
<Ray> 02so true, lol
<Roara|Touhou> 6ike, some magic gap in the bullets as they go other directiong
<Roara|Touhou> 6directions
<Roara|Touhou> 6"uh...I KNEW THAT GAP WOULD BE THERE"
<Angel_Espeon> 13I hate when bullets SPAWN INSIDE YOUR HITBOX
<Angel_Espeon> 13.w.
<Xiagu> There are quite a few rhyme schemes for sonnets, funkydalek
<Roara|Touhou> 6oh fuuuuuu those
<funkydalek> shakespearian one
<Sketchy_Sounds> One of my favourite holidays is next month
<funkydalek> he uses all the same
<Roara|Touhou> 6or even worse, the ones that spawn so close that yuo HAVE the chance to get away
<Larscis> Apparently August is meant to make people happy, since this week is National Smile Week and next week is Friendship Week
<Roara|Touhou> 6but you dont get away
<Sketchy_Sounds> That being the 19th of next month.
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Roara|Touhou> 6so you feel like a moron
<Ray> 02^
<Ray> 02;_;
<prince-dari> >lock room with password of random string letters
<prince-dari> >someone immediately joins
<prince-dari> Wut
<Ray> 02aka: Mokuo's second spell card
<prince-dari> I don't think this is going to work. XD
<Angel_Espeon> 13I. AM NOT. A MORON.
<Angel_Espeon> 13But yeah I agree
<Sketch> Brb
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Roara|Touhou> 6lol
<funkydalek> i just heard a spider in my room O.o
<Sketchy_Sounds> Of course my favourite day of September is four days after that.
<Blums> heard a spider?
<Sketchy_Sounds> ...you /heard/ it?
<Blums> I'm afraid for you.
<funkydalek> ayup
<Larscis> Sketchy_Sounds: September 19...National Butterscotch Pudding Day?
<Dusty_Nails> My poetry = bad/ Yet I spout it anyway/ Do you ponies mind?
<Larscis> Or the other one?
<Ray> 02for anyone who wants the replay, lol. http://puu.sh/4b5C
<Sketchy_Sounds> Larscis: Nope, International Talk Like A Pirate Day.
<prince-dari> Hmm
<Larscis> Ah, so the other one
<funkydalek> once i heard a spider in the middle of the night
<Ray> 02anyway
<Polarfire> there's always option 2.
<funkydalek> i thought it was a ghost
<Ray> 02Angel RE-DOWNLOAD TH9
<Roara|Touhou> 6I still glorify the person who beat EoSD's extra with no deaths
<Blums> once i woke up in the middle of the night and there was a spider on my face
<Roara|Touhou> 6LOL PoFV
<Angel_Espeon> 13I kinda feel like a cheat though, for some reason my copy of PCB and IN already had extra mode/phantasm/last words unlocked
<Larscis> Though many people prefer the holiday that begins on September 17 instead.
<Roara|Touhou> 6that game is so fun
<Sketchy_Sounds> funky I thought you lived in Britain
<FallSilently> September 17th is a holiday?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm playing fairly of course, only trying the extra modes after I 1cc'd normal mode myself
<Sketchy_Sounds> We don't have spiders big enoug to have health meters in this country
<ValtheJean> the can can
<Pegacorn> EXPLOSION
<funkydalek> it was so big it was scraping along my posteEEEEWW NO blums i gonna have nightmares!
<Dermathil> DOCTOR WHO
<Larscis> FallSilently: First day of Oktoberfest
<Angel_Espeon> 13but seeing as every last word has been unlocked and completed
<Ray> 02I haven\t unlocked PCB's extra ._.
<Polarfire> ....
<Polarfire> pacman
<FallSilently> Oh right.
<Angel_Espeon> 13whoever uploaded my copy of IN must've been such a pro
<funkydalek> i do live it britain!
<Unidentified54799> sup
<ValtheJean> MUTHER FUCKIN SOCK PUPPETS
<Blums> XD when i woke up I just waited untill it crawed off and went bac to sleep
<funkydalek> It was a house spider!!
<FallSilently> I'm not german and don't drink.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ray, use Sakuya in PCB, she makes it so much easier LOL
<Larscis> FallSilently: It's also Constitution Day and Citizenship Day here in the US.
<Winter-puff> i vote for sock puppets
<Ray> 02I knooooow
<funkydalek> You didnt do anything!!!
<Ray> 02Buuuut I suuuck at deathbombing
<FallSilently> I see....
<Ray> 02:'<
<funkydalek> YOu went back to sleeep!!!
<Roara|Touhou> 6there's a demotivational for PoFV I must link
<Winter-puff> awww
<Pegacorn> OSHITSON
<Blums> yeah....
<ValtheJean> He was gone before I mentioned them
<ValtheJean> whore
<Sketchy_Sounds> But yeah the 23rd is my favourite day of September.
<prince-dari> Lies
<Sketch> funkydalek, your name inspires an amusing mental picture
<funkydalek> woah
<Roara|Touhou> 6http://www.deviantart.com/download/147480948/touhou___mindfck___demotivator_by_zk306.jpg
<Ray> 02Got way to used to TH8's 19384942358732465923847563 seconds to react
<Angel_Espeon> 13Adapt so you bomb a split second before the bullet actually hits you xD
<funkydalek> :3
<Angel_Espeon> 13I had to adapt to it when I started playing MoF
<Blums> Well what was i supposed to do? squish it on my face?
<FallSilently> Eat it.
<funkydalek> you're hard core
<Angel_Espeon> 13since deathbombing is practically impossible in that game LOL
<Roara|Touhou> 6MoF has like.... .000000000001 seconds to react
<Ray> 02LOL
<Roara|Touhou> 6add a few more 0s to that
<FallSilently> Just flick your tongue out, and pop, no more spider.
<May> 14sorry D:
<ValtheJean> overruled
<funkydalek> D:
<FallSilently> Yummy.
<Blums> nah funkydalek, I'm actually very squeemish of spiders
<Pegacorn> HOLD IT!
<funkydalek> mee toooo
<Roara|Touhou> 6deathbombing is fairly hard in EoSD too
<Dermathil> btw, Justice is now a MECHA PILOT
<ValtheJean> cough SOCK PUPPETS cough
<Roara|Touhou> 6I actually didn't know about deathbombing until like 2 weeks later
<Ray> 02EoS-- ninja'd
<funkydalek> how big was the spider??
<Sketchy_Sounds> I have nothing against spiders when they're in plain sight.
<Sketch> I think spiders are kinda cool
<Roara|Touhou> 6because it's so hard in that game
<SilverMane> omygoshomygoshomygosh
<FallSilently> Spiders are grand. Cute little things.
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's when they turn up in unexpected locations I go a bit nuts.
<Pyroh> Im baaaaaaaack
<Sketch> it's bugs I don't like, so spiders prevent the things I don't like from being around
<Pyroh> Dun dun dun
<CogWeaver> except turantulas
<Ray> 02so true lol
<Angel_Espeon> 13Have you ever played Touhou and clearly seen a bullet heading towards you
<Angel_Espeon> 13and you know you should bomb
<CogWeaver> those are just freakish
<Angel_Espeon> 13and you want to bomb
<Angel_Espeon> 13but for whatever reason
<Sketchy_Sounds> For example the time I found one on the underside of my towel right after getting out of the shower.
<funkydalek> how do you do that thing where you're like, bleeeeep, to other people?
<Sketch> amusing enough for a brony, I'm actually somewhat afraid of real horses. (not really ponies mind you)
<Angel_Espeon> 13you don't press X
<Angel_Espeon> 13and you die
<prince-dari> I'll try and play a quest page with this lag. :P
<Angel_Espeon> 13._.
<prince-dari> It might be possible.
<FallSilently> Tarantulas are awesome. I wish I had one.
<Ray> 02Yes.
<funkydalek> Hahaha!
<Ray> 02It's painfull, lol
<Roara|Touhou> 6yep
<FallSilently> I bet the budgie would love him.
<Roara|Touhou> 6thats like
<Roara|Touhou> 6the definition of touhou
<Roara|Touhou> 6thinking you can make it
<Roara|Touhou> 6and then you dont
<Sketch> tarantualas are indeed kinda cool
<F-Frost> Real horses are evil...
<Angel_Espeon> 13I kick myself so hard whenever it happens LOL
<Roara|Touhou> 6yep
<Angel_Espeon> 13My brain is telling me to bomb, but my finger doesn't react
<Angel_Espeon> 13D:
<Blums> I know F-Frost. Have you seen bad horse?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Real horses are bonkers.
<Sketch> I tend to agree F-Frost, even if, by only irrational thinking
<johnsey> <3 horses
<Roara|Touhou> 6there are somethings you just cant avoid
<Roara|Touhou> 6for everything else, there's master spaerk
<Roara|Touhou> 6-e
<Blums> oh and funkydalek, you just have to spell out someones full name in your message to ding them
<The_Si> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/43242
<johnsey> (no, not in _that_ way)
<Xiagu> real horses are huuuuuge
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<CogWeaver> hooray for irrational thoughts!
<johnsey> hah
<funkydalek> oooooooh
<Ray> 02LOL, I'm like" HI HIGHLY DEATHLY BULLET, MAY I RUN INTO YOU?!
<Sketch> I keep thinking they are going to Christopher Reeve my ass when I get close -.-
<funkydalek> ok, check this out...
<ValtheJean> I've learned my lesson
<Blums> ponies are pretty big too..
<ValtheJean> I'm not clicking links again
<Sketch> (bad joke aside)
<funkydalek> Blums blumson
<Angel_Espeon> 13I do that on stage 1 sometimes when I get a bit too cocky, LOL
<Blums> Dinged!
<funkydalek> YAY!!
<Sketchy_Sounds> Although that said I've noticed it seems to depend on the breed and the raising of said horse as to how bonkers it will be.
<NewDCD> Dari you should
<Angel_Espeon> 13Flying all over the screen around the bullets, collecting points and powerups like a pro
<F-Frost> My arms are covered with scars from horse injuries...
<Ray> 02But for me.. it's like ALL THE TIME.
<Sketch> and indeed, hooray irrational thoughts
<NewDCD> stream some SRWJ for us
<Angel_Espeon> 13and I run right into a stray bullet I didn't notice
<ValtheJean> ohhell yes!
<Roara|Touhou> 6yep
<Roara|Touhou> 6same
<Xiagu> at least most ponies aren't taller than I am
<Roara|Touhou> 6you feel so legit
<Roara|Touhou> 6getting everything
<ValtheJean> GET IT WHORE
<Sketchy_Sounds> For example when I lived out in the country there was a nearby farm that had a great big Clydesdale, and it was the most docile thing ever.
<Sketch> yeah, ponies are kinda small, and seem docile enough
<ValtheJean> WHOOOOOOOOORE
<Roara|Touhou> 6and then you run into that one bullet going .05 mph
<SilverMane> I KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD PLAY
<Sketch> horses though...
<FallSilently> I've never seen a real pony.
<Roara|Touhou> 6OR WORSE
<SilverMane> I KNOW I KNOW
<Ray> 02y do that in almost everystage .-.
<Roara|Touhou> 6THE FAIRY WHO DOESNT SHOOT ANYTHING
<Ray> 02I*
<Ray> 02OH
<Ray> 02Nuuu
<F-Frost> I just love one of the police horses I saw, it killed a rabbit and ate it, true story.
<SilverMane> Go to Kongregrate.com, look up Mardek Chapter 1
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Sketch> O.O
<Blums> I made up my username then looked it up.. turns out Blums is the name of a swimwear and intimate apparel store...
<Ray> 02I ragequit when that happens
<SilverMane> Play the Mardek series for us!
<FallSilently> At least, I don't remember seeing any.
<Ray> 02it's like... NO...
<Sketch> lol Blums
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm laughing so hard knowing I'm not the only one who's done that
<FallSilently> hehe
<Blums> Just my luck =D
<Xiagu> F*** being a herbivore, I do what I want!
<SilverMane> i hav eno iea what is happening on screen
<Sketch> lol.
<johnsey> oh well, cloppy time
*Sketch is a herbivore.. mostly
<Pegacorn> The_Si,what IS the image you posted?
<ValtheJean> he's shooting at what can only be described as clayface monsters
<johnsey|snoremode> nite all!
<Roara|Touhou> 6xD
<Roara|Touhou> 6OH YAY IT WORKS
<Blums> good night
<FallSilently> See yah
<Sketch> night Johnsey
<Roara|Touhou> 6 3 HOURS LATER
<Sketchy_Sounds> Oh no wait
<F-Frost> I share name with some russian weirdo...
<Roara|Touhou> 6I HAVE A WORKING SA
<Ray> 02WHAT WORKS?
<Sketch> don't come back silently and make derpy evil now
<funkydalek> guten nacht
<Roara|Touhou> 6bring it
<Sketchy_Sounds> It was a Shire horse, not a Clydesdale.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I remember running backwards into a boss character after going up to collect points once ._.
<Sketchy_Sounds> It was way too big to be a Clydesdale.
<F-Frost> Shire horses, TANK!!
<Roara|Touhou> 6I do that a lot
<FallSilently> I wouldn't know the difference.
<F-Frost> 900kg of DOOM
<Ray> 02^
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Solar Flare (Update Story 2!) (http://tinyurl.com/6d7rbfz)
<Roara|Touhou> 6"LEMME GRAB THESE ITEMS- OH HELLO SAKUYA LEMME JUST RUN INTO YOU"

<Pegacorn> It's safe ValtheJean.You can click it.
<F-Frost> I´ve had one running towards me, I shat bricks
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Sketch> aw :(
<Ray> 02nah.

<Ray> 02I need to play more Th's :< I only have TH6-9
<Blums> She's sad that all the pie's gone
<Pegacorn> It's just a frame from the "Socks" comic on EqD.It's Rarity with a wierd face looking at Fluttershy.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I went up to collect powerups and as I was coming down she appeared right in front of me
<Angel_Espeon> 13;w;
<Roara|Touhou> 6I've beaten meiling's, remilia's, and patchouli's
<funkydalek> that too
<FallSilently> I need to actually do something with my DeviantArt page. Haven't really used it since I joined a week ago.

<FallSilently> Nyx everywhere!
<MrPoniator> Since the url begs you to fav
<Roara|Touhou> 6I still havent beaten that game
<Ray> 02lol.
<Angel_Espeon> 13I don't remember where I got my copy from, but google usually gives you plenty to choose from :3
<Roara|Touhou> 6I don't try much anymore
<Flamerunner|TF2> what the hell is a nix
<Roara|Touhou> 6but youmu DESTROYS ME
<Roara|Touhou> 6EVERY TIME
<Pegacorn> Dat air tbag.
<The_Si> That Mario stomp wasn't very effective.
<Blums> wait nyx?
<Blums> wot?
<funkydalek> oooh, whats gringing MrPoniator??
<ValtheJean> reverse tbag
<Sketch> eh, in name, but at least the url is short
<Sketch> and it lacks ponybooru's epic slowness
<NightmareMoon> Yay, my new sequel is posted.
<FallSilently> Nyx is an OC pony from the Past Sins fanfic.
<Xiagu> ...she's sitting on Celestia's head. aargh that's adorable :D
<Flamerunner|TF2> Nyx*
<Pegacorn> Good luck.
<MrPoniator> I know
<Angel_Espeon> 13Youmu doesn't bother me much anymore o-o
<Dermathil> OH SNAP
<Xiagu> Also in Creeping Darkness, iirc
<Dermathil> STAIRWAY LEVEL
<Ray> 02tha
<Angel_Espeon> 13then again, I've played stage 4, 5 and 6 so many times now
<Dermathil> I remember it
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<MrPoniator> Just that the short-form links with their "fav.me/something" gringes me
<ValtheJean> dari's lying
<Ray> 02asdhd\d
<FallSilently> She's spread!?
<ValtheJean> he just sucks ass :P
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: League of Extraodrinary Gamers Charity Event (http://tinyurl.com/3pfvksj)
<Roara|Touhou> 6true lol
<Polarfire> aaaaaaaaaah
<Xiagu> no, Creeping Darkness was first
<Pegacorn> OBJECTION
<funkydalek> file not found
<Roara|Touhou> 6I can run through the first 3 stages with NOOOOOOOOO problem
<Polarfire> aaaaah
<F-Frost> I wont read those, I think what I am doing is too similar...
<Roara|Touhou> 6no bombs, bo lives
<Flamerunner|TF2> What is Nyx supposed to be
<FallSilently> We need Season 2, quick, before she gets any more accepted.
<Roara|Touhou> 6and I can get clear to yukari's like, 2nd spell
<Roara|Touhou> 6before I use a bomb
<Roara|Touhou> 6then youmu walks in
<Blums> an OC of filly nightmare moon, flamerunner
<Angel_Espeon> 13I hate nearly all the stage 3s apart from Patchouli's :<
<Roara|Touhou> 6I picture her with a troll face these days
<Pegacorn> This game.'Nuff said.
<MrPoniator> From Past Sins
<FallSilently> Nyx is the Nightmare Moon extracted from Luna and turned into a baby.
<funkydalek> i havent read that yet
<F-Frost> spoiler alert...!
<Zanzibar> You should, it's a good fic.
<Blums> thats not a spoiler..
<Xiagu> They're spoilers of like the first chapter
<F-Frost> ok maybe not...
<Xiagu> People can deal with it.
<Angel_Espeon> 13On my very first 1cc of CtC, I was doing brilliantly up until Yukari
<Pegacorn> TAKE IT LIKE A MAN SHORTY!
<ValtheJean> he's just setting our expectations low
<Ray> 02lmao
<Zanzibar> Anything that happens in chapter 2 really shouldn't be called a spoiler.
<funkydalek> i knew that and ihavent read it
<ValtheJean> so that way we're impressed when he wins :P
<FallSilently> That's basic info. I haven't read it and even I know that.
<Angel_Espeon> 13where I ran into Ran by accident
<funkydalek> its like the blurb
<Pegacorn> brb,gotta eat
<Angel_Espeon> 13then she took like 2 more lives off me
<Angel_Espeon> 13then I thought "screw this"
<Xiagu> ...yeah actually I think it is in the blurb, lol
<Zanzibar> "filly NMM" is pretty much what the fic is all about.
<Angel_Espeon> 13and somehow got to stage 6 without losing any other lives
<funkydalek> ehehe
<Angel_Espeon> 13which I've never done before |D
<Roara|Touhou> 6...wow
<Roara|Touhou> 6lol
<Blums> hmmm... first bananas refrence on ponybooru came up
<Sketch> I actually think I'm fanfic'ed out for a few days. I marathoned Of Mares and Magic, and it left me feeling Melancholy.
<Sketch> of course I'm probably only fanfic'ed out until something I normally read actually updates.
<Xiagu> Sketch, do you want a hug?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I remember saying out loud to Youmu "get out the way, I'm not in the mood for you right now"
<Sketch> yes
<Sketch> yes I do
<Sketch> heh
<Ray> 02lol.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Well, that's not exactly what I said, but I'd be kicked if I typed it word for word :P
*Xiagu hugs Sketch ^^
<Angel_Espeon> 13It worked though~
*Sketch feels loved
<Sketchy_Sounds> brb
<FallSilently> The bananas are inevitable.
<Blums> well this is a pony board of friendship and magic so
<F-Frost> On feathered wings did the same to me...
<ValtheJean> YOU GOWNA DIE DARI
<ValtheJean> YU GOWNA DIIIIIE
*Blums pulls everyone in the entire chatroom into one big hug
<funkydalek> i have to go to bed
*Ray pokes Angel
<funkydalek> ive got work in the mornin
<Angel_Espeon> 13x.o
<Ray> 02Eeeehh.. is the patch included? .-.
<funkydalek> yay hugs
<Sketch> have a good night there funkydalek
<funkydalek> thaaaaankyoup :D
*Sketch enjoys grouphug. Ponypile!
<Xiagu> hugs for everypony!
<Angel_Espeon> 13Patch?
<Angel_Espeon> 13English patch, you mean?
<Ray> 02Yep
*FallSilently readies crossbow
<Angel_Espeon> 13I wouldn't know, like I said I just googled and found that link for you xD
<FallSilently> Back! Baaack!
<Angel_Espeon> 13gensokyo.org will have the patch for you though
<Blums> Oh no.. we're reaching critical mass! Shoot we're gonna make a blackhole!
<Ray> 02to lazy to type English
<F-Frost> *Readies crossbow* was one of the first things I saw in here -.-
<Blums> XD
<Xiagu> FallSilently is resisting! Quick, activate SADPANDA EYES
<BludSpammd> Listen up everypony! I know alot of holes they possibly could fill up in season 2!
*Sketchy_Sounds chuckles
<Blums> Like luna dissapearing for one?
<FallSilently> Good heavens, Blums
<Angel_Espeon> 13Speaking of MoF I still need to beat Suwako
<BludSpammd> 1. How Luna became nightmare moon
<Angel_Espeon> 13I haven't really tried lately =w=
<Blums> already explained
<BludSpammd> Yes Blums thats a good point too
<Roara|Touhou> 6I watched someone beat suwako at fanime
<Roara|Touhou> 6he was pretty insane LOL
<FallSilently> Blud, I mean
<BludSpammd> How?
<Roara|Touhou> 6it was the opening to his panel
<FallSilently> I do tend to ready the crossbow at the slightest provocation.
<Sketch> 2. Why most of the population of Equestria is seemingly female?
<Sketch> heh
<Roara|Touhou> 6he was like "ok, my name is so and so, and what is touhou? let me show you" *whips out laptop)
<Roara|Touhou> 6*
<Blums> she was all sad and resentful that everyone shunned her night, so she became her sorrow manifest
<Sketchy_Sounds> *Snerk*
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<BludSpammd> That was never explained in the series
<F-Frost> ep1?
<Blums> well.. its a girls show =P
<FallSilently> Most male ponies kill themselves when they see the happy pastel hell they've been born into.
<Sketch> I think it's kinda like China
<Blums> yeah nightmare moon was covered in the beginning of ep 1
<Sketch> they must have a colt policy
<Dermathil> yeah Boss
<Roara|Touhou> 6now then
<ValtheJean> see? told you he was just lowering our expectations :P
<drf|away> 02*WB03(May03)02WB* - <May> I always thought you were one of the smartest people here
<Sketch> keep the population of colts down per capita
<Roara|Touhou> 6I have a working game
<Ray> 02Angel ANGEL
<ValtheJean> ohai moria pillars
<BludSpammd> 3. Its possible Pixie would return to take revenge on Twilight Sparkle
<Ray> 02you are awesome, lol.
<Dermathil> Yes,
<Roara|Touhou> 6Imma play to see if I can actually learn the other teams
<Paul_McColtney> Trixie
<Sketch> Trixie
<Ray> 02The link. has the OST\
<Roara|Touhou> 6I want to see whch would be best before going up to utsuho
<Ray> 02not the game, lol xD
<BludSpammd> Trixie I mean :(
<Blums> *trixie fanfare*
<Roara|Touhou> 6the game itself doesnt bother me actually, I find it and EoSD the easiest
<Angel_Espeon> 13wait what
<Angel_Espeon> 13|D
<Roara|Touhou> 6WHCH IS WEIRD I KNOW
<FallSilently> Celestia is a harsh matriarch. The colt population is kept under strict control. Rarity keeps hers in a pen beside her house.
<Angel_Espeon> 13LOL
<Dermathil> Tell em about the goblin army
<Angel_Espeon> 13Roara is different
<Roara|Touhou> 6wait
<Angel_Espeon> 13:D
<Sketch> indeed. Tis a sad world for colts in equestria
<Roara|Touhou> 6that link had the ost too?
<Roara|Touhou> 6oh
<Sketch> Pull a carriage, work in the guard, work on a farm. Or gtfo
<Roara|Touhou> 6just the ost
<Roara|Touhou> 6nvm
<FallSilently> They're occasionally allowed out to drag snowploughs.
<F-Frost> Were there any colts in earlier gens...?
<CogWeaver> but hey, plenty of fillies
<Kalliope> Chop down a tree.
<Roara|Touhou> 6I was gonna say, SMALL GAME FILE WTF
<BludSpammd> Yeah, there must be some explonation why there are so few colts
<Sketchy_Sounds> There were, yes.
<F-Frost> Oh god the horror of being an early gen colt...
<Blums> Early gen colts had it good
<Sketch> you know, I've tried to watch some of the old gens on Youtube. just for the flanks and saddles. But yeah. it's bad. really pretty bad
<Roara|Touhou> 6you know
<FallSilently> Spike was in the earlier gens, and the cracks in his sanity were very visible.
<Pegacorn> I'm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!
<Roara|Touhou> 6NO ONE uses aya as a partner in SA
<Winter-puff> wb
*Roara|Touhou 6does so
<Blums> they seemed normal albeit maybe being segregated from the fillies for long periods
<Pegacorn> Thanks Winter-puff
<F-Frost> Yes, the swe dubed spike is... o.o!!
<DracoSemiAway> Blums: Word of God said some external force was ALSO corrupting Luna. Also that Trixie won't be back.
<Pegacorn> Yeah right dari
<Angel_Espeon> 13There must be a reason why :P
<Zanzibar> They've released a Swedish version now?
<Blums> External forc? where did you hear that?
<Zanzibar> Anyone have a youtube link?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I personally don't like her ability
<DesertRose> http://img.ponibooru.org/images/31/31a5932978b2f8090d4f4dbff4e4a778
<BludSpammd> What do you mean"Trixie wont be back"?
<Sketch> You know, fanfic seems to paint trixie as eventually having a change of heart or a goodness inside her. But I kinda doubt it.
<Roara|Touhou> 6being super fast?
<DesertRose> SOCKS!!!!!!!!!!
<SilverMane> GREAT WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT DARI
<Sketchy_Sounds> Lauren Faust herself said that was the idea @ external force.
<Sketch> I just think, if she came back, she would still be a jerk
<F-Frost> No, the earlier gens is dubed
<Winter-puff> er..sure
<ValtheJean> dari sucks donkey balls
<Angel_Espeon> 13since you don't really need all that speed when you're spending most of the game being surrounded by bullets |D
<Pegacorn> We say that you're gonna die.
<Roara|Touhou> 6yeah
<Blums> uh oh
<Roara|Touhou> 6I prefer speed tbh
<Roara|Touhou> 6whch is why I refuse to be reimu in EoSD
<Pegacorn> SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!
<Ray> 02I prefer being slooow
<Zanzibar> Ah. Would have surprised me if it was this quick.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hi Rainy
<Pegacorn> HYES
<Pattyrick|MiragicaTR> ^
<Angel_Espeon> 13I have better control over slower characters, hence Reimu xD
<Pegacorn> lol
<BludSpammd> And probably cause the fans like Lyra, Ditzy, Vinyl I am pretty sure there will be episodes about them as well
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also homing amulets
<Angel_Espeon> 13<3
<Blums> maybe they should hit her with the elements of harmony
<Sketch> but you know, gotta look at the nicer side. I did recently read a Gilda fanfic that did actually get me on her side. Amazing what fanfic can do
<Ray> 02which is why I use Youmu in TH9/Reimu on every other TH
<Sketch> Hi RainDancer
<Roara|Touhou> 6LETS BE A TENGU, SEE IF WE CAN CHEAT THE SYSTEM
<Roara|Touhou> 6simply because
<RainDancer> Heya

<Steven_Magnet> 6 Caramel is 54% Tasty. (1388)
<Sathi> I wish I could stream...but since my soundcard is not realtek... I encounter problems
<Angel_Espeon> 13Also Ray, if MoF doesn't play at 60fps for you, click vpatch.exe and play it from there
<Sketch> what is? lol
<CogWeaver> ...
<Angel_Espeon> 13just so you know if you didn't already .w.

<DesertRose> Pistols bits
<BludSpammd> You have to register to make Derpy listen
<FallSilently> Some sort of back-mounted Cutie Mark Crusader launcher seems about right.
<Sketch> which is just fun to say
<Dman> Pegacorn u smexy boi
<Sketch> battle saddle

<ValtheJean> Dari, you are a cumslut, that is all
<Pegacorn> WUT

<Xiagu> DracoSemiAway, you're not satisfied with handwaving using one handed weapons in their mouths? swords and stuff?
<DesertRose> Unicorn
<Dman> 'Cumslut'
<Dman> whatisthis
<Angel_Espeon> 13The impossible has been done
<Angel_Espeon> 13:P
<DracoSemiAway> Does "battle saddle" have a defined meaning?
<ValtheJean> O_o
<Dman> cumslut A person seen as one who will do anything to receive a man's semen, particularly in an orifice
<ValtheJean> *facehoof*
<Pegacorn> God.Everypony is comming onto me.
<Dman> Google defenishun
<FallSilently> Yeah. It's a saddle used in battle.
<Sketch> lol
*DesertRose derps
<FallSilently> Or worn outside of battle but is still battle saddle.
<Dman> So nothing's streaming?
*ValtheJean is now suddenly reminded that he's of the "older generation" of bronies >.<
<ValtheJean> OH WHAT THE FUCK DARI
<ValtheJean> TOO FAR
<FallSilently> Or just not worn, like left on the ground somewhere, but is still battle saddle.
<AppleDashWINS> why are we talking about pony weaponry?
<Dman> Valthejean wat do u mean 'older G' of bronies?
<DracoSemiAway> Xiagu: Well, those are one option, especially with stainless steel-and-leather mouth-guards for handles.
<Roara|Touhou> 6pacifist?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Because we can
<DesertRose> Fallout Equestria related?
<DesertRose> somehow
<Sketch> I like the idea of buck-knives. like the knives that pop out of the back of shoes? except for the back hooves of ponies
<Flamerunner|TF2> For the good of all of us
<CogWeaver> do you have a paddle on your battle saddle?
<RainDancer> The generic human battle-saddle has specially reinforced places for rifle holders, pistol holsters, sword scabbards, or lance crutches. The like.
<Flamerunner|TF2> Except the ones who are dead
<ValtheJean> old enough to drink alchyhawl in the states :P
<Roara|Touhou> 6what is pacifist?
<ValtheJean> *facehoof*
<Dman> as in bronies before others? or you have more age?

<Roara|Touhou> 6I thought it was another word for Ultra/Ultimate mode
<Sathi> eeeyup
<Sathi> :D
<The_Crowing> battle saddles?
<DracoSemiAway> But sharp wires strung between the hindhooves could work for pegasi, or saddle-bags filled with javelins (just to a roll over the enemy, beyond reach).
<Dman> Dari - 2 chrome themes. not much
<ValtheJean> you know it dari ;)
<Dman> Sathi - oh
<Pegacorn> I'm never safe.EVERYWHERE i go somepony reveals that they love me.

*Sathi wonders what she's looking at
<Dman> so...sod all is going on in thes tream right now?
<DracoSemiAway> Spiked shoes carefully NOT enchanted to be solid to clouds could work for pegasi (others would dull them too quickly walking around).

<ValtheJean> >implying there isn't a bomb under your house
<FallSilently> PinkiePie's next, though we don't really share online times.
<ValtheJean> indeed, I am implying that :P
<Barry> How many people have read "Beyond the Fourth Wall"?
<ValtheJean> the trick is knowing when it goes off ;)
<Luna> I'd like to dualboot linux, I don't know how, or even if I can though
<MrPoniator> And what
<HyperMetalLugia> Don't do it
<HyperMetalLugia> Bad idea
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 Microsoft names the next GUI something like Windows Aurora
<Dermathil> Dari, it will go off when the stream stops.
*drf|laptop hides
<Fish609> ugh got to read book for school but just want to roll around with ponies
<drf|laptop> 03that would seem the most logical
<Dermathil> Be careful.
<MrPoniator> You'd have enough time to beat me anyway since I'll be off between thursday and sunday
<HyperMetalLugia> I bet 'he' gave you that terrible idea ;P
<drf|laptop> 03of anyone else's here
<HyperMetalLugia> Aurora channel
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol
<ValtheJean> >implying it isn't a gas bomb
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Dermathil> Dari, not really.
<NewDCD> 9Okay guys
<FallSilently> Bwahahaaa
<drf|laptop> 03what other person could you see having a graphical theme named after them XD
<Barry> My mistake, it's actually called "The Breaking of the Wall".
<Fish609> Do you think ponies are big enough to ride?
<Blums> buy a twilight plush and read with that Fish609?
<Luna> Actually, Lightning gave me the idea
<Sketchy_Sounds> Mmm delicious stats
<HyperMetalLugia> Crystal
<HyperMetalLugia> Lolhim
<ValtheJean> holes
<Fish609> Like, how would a pony compare with like a german sheppard
<HyperMetalLugia> Don't listen to him
<Fish609> or are they big like, a pony.
<Sketch> I have the next few days off. I'm going to be a chat vagrant
<ValtheJean> that I dug
<Luna> who?
<HyperMetalLugia> Linux is terrible :P
<Dermathil> What if it simply destroys the basement and causes the house to crash down on you. You wont die on the spot)
<HyperMetalLugia> Both!
<ValtheJean> tapped into your ventilation system
<Luna> Lightning is a girl
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh
*Sketch drinks sweet tea
<RainDancer> I always thought the ponies the size of horses....and now that I think about it, they're really big. ._.
<HyperMetalLugia> Confusing names
<ValtheJean> boi, don't you go questioning my methods
<Luna> And I'll listen to "him" as you refer to it, as much as I want
<Blums> ponies are smaller than horses, but still pretty big
<Blums> google it up
<ValtheJean> I need your body intact in order to ra-...I mean bury you
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh my God I did it again, what is wrong with me ._.
<drf|laptop> 03anyway yeah
<Luna> What'd you do?
<drf|laptop> 03dualbooting Linux is actually really easy
<Sketch> not too big though, only come up to about my chest
<Dermathil> Val, check P&D. DId I say something?
<drf|laptop> 03as long as your hard drive is big enough to hold both operating systems

<Fish609> well I know how big a pony is but that still is a ton larger than I imagine them. If you compare fluttershy to angel bunny she is not that big.
<Sketch> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bRca8BsNKM&NR=1
<Luna> How big does it need to be?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Considering the overall size of the ponies in relation to the objects they interact with, I think it's safe to assume the ponies in the show are about the size of iRL ponies, height wise at least.
<ValtheJean> "<Dermathil>: (WUT DID DARI SAY) <Dermathil>: (also SIlvermane, #silvershipper ) <Dermathil>: (and when do RS usually get on?) <Dermathil>: (Chatlag for me?) <Dermathil>: (SOMEPONY SAY SOMETHING)"
<HyperMetalLugia> Why not use LiveCDs to save space :P
<Dman> Sathi - it loaded.
<Dman> OMAAAAAAAAAAAAGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<HyperMetalLugia> Over 30 GB?
<Dermathil> ah
<drf|laptop> 03a couple GB
<drf|laptop> 03no
<Sathi> 7pfew
<Dman> BEST. IMAGE. EVEEEEEEEEEEER.
<Sathi> 7was worried a moment
<drf|laptop> 03probably 2-3GB at the minmum, I recommend 10 or 15
*Dman is zoomed in on luna, and has been for like 1 min.
<Angel_Espeon> 13Closed a tab that was uploading a large file to MegaUpload
<Luna> Oh, then I have lots then
<FallSilently> I think they're small. I assume Angel Bunny is about the size of a normal rabbit.
<Dermathil> This isn'
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<Dman> SOOO GOOOOOD and not even on other yet
<Angel_Espeon> 13I'm not even reliable with uploading files anymore :<
<drf|laptop> 03basically, the Linux CD should come with GParted, you use that to shrink your Windows partition down by a few GB
<Luna> Aw AE, that sucks
<HyperMetalLugia> But does Luna have enough internets to download it
<drf|laptop> 03then install Linux to that empty space
<FallSilently> It is called "My LITTLE Pony"
<Sketchy_Sounds> I think the apple scale was more reliable - an entire apple can easily be munched up by a pony.
<Blums> Jackrabbits arent that short when they sit up
<Fish609> For example
<Fish609> http://imnotparanoid68.deviantart.com/art/Fluttershy-and-Angel-bunny-233893746
<HyperMetalLugia> (Luna, try Chrome OS/Chromium OS for Linux :P)
<ValtheJean> so which doctor series is this? the good one or the one I pretend is good to troll dari? :P
<Dermathil> BLINK AND YOULL MISS is what I'm looking forward
<Angel_Espeon> 13If I accidentally close this tab again I'm gonna shoot someone and blame it on them .w.
<Dermathil> Val, this is the Ecclestone one
<prince-dari> First series.
<Luna> Unfortunately, where I bought my laptop, they would only give me the CDs unless I paid them to set up the computer for $100
<prince-dari> Eccleston is good.
<prince-dari> (though I prefer Tennant)
<Fish609> Oh yeah. Fluttershy is my favorite.
<JetTheLatios> Luna you talked for once in the chat.
<JetTheLatios> owo
<Sketchy_Sounds> There's just some cartoonish deformation of proportions is the thing.
<JetTheLatios> Why are you always so quiet?
<Blums> well can you imagine it if angel was properly sclared to fluttershy? she'd squish him by accident
<Dermathil> Yeah
<Dermathil> Tennant is best doctor
<drf|laptop> 03LOL what
<Winter-puff> same
<HyperMetalLugia> I wonder why
<Luna> I guess I don't have anything to say o.o
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<drf|laptop> 03do you have a CD burner though?
<Fish609> I want to make sweet freinship with Fluttershy.
<Sketch> can't. stop. listening. to. verses. of. pony. swag
<Luna> Yes
<drf|laptop> 03you can just download the image file and burn it
<Dermathil> uh oh
<Luna> Alright
<Fish609> If that makes sense.
<Luna> Actually
<Fish609> Anyone else listening to Equestria Radio?>
<drf|laptop> 03As for what version of Linux, that's entirely up to you
<drf|laptop> 03I USED to suggest Ubuntu, but I hate the new ones
<Dermathil> UH OH
<Luna> One minute drf, just a random question
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<HyperMetalLugia> Hey DRF, what terrible Linux distro do you think she should use :P
<Dermathil> WRONG DAY OR YEAR
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<Fish609> Ponify.me?
<Sketch> you know, I haven't yet listened to equestria radio
<MrPoniator> Welp, just read another grimdark fic
<junh1024-XD> xubuntu?
<The_Crowing> you mean celestia radio?
<HyperMetalLugia> I think all the main ones are horrible, IMO
<drf|laptop> 03I dunno, Fedora seems alright
<Sketch> must rememdy that here eventually
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<MrPoniator> Guess I could finally dig into Past Sins tonight
<Fish609> yeah thats what i meant
<HyperMetalLugia> Partedmagic as a desktop OS= Profit
<Fish609> Read "Of Mares and Magic"
<Blums> "Sweet music, Oooosweet music. I like the sound when you're around. Sweet music, oooo sweet music!"
<Fish609> my favorite so far
<The_Crowing> what about Everypony radio?
<Sketch> blarg, didn't end up likeing Of Mares and Magic too much. but it was good
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> But it's also fun as nobody supports it
<MrPoniator> Of Mares and Magic?
<Zanzibar> Of Mares and Magic was decent. But not more than that.
<Fish609> I was PO'd until the epilogue came out lol
<prince-dari> BAD WOLF
<Blums> I prefer the ballad of twilight sparkle, its funnier
<Luna> I was thinking ubuntu, isn't it free?
<Sketch> holding off on Past Sins for some reason. It's like that movie you -know- is good. You've heard is good. everyone is talking about it. But your waiting till it's on video?
<HyperMetalLugia> So yay finding 'packages' for updates
<HyperMetalLugia> Ohgod ubuntu
<Zanzibar> Yeah, Ballade is better
<drf|laptop> 03All Linux versions are free except Red Hat
<Luna> And I have a 4.7GB DVD-R, is that big enough?
<Luna> Aah
<HyperMetalLugia> Doens't anybody talk about ano other Distro
<HyperMetalLugia> And yes
<HyperMetalLugia> Big
<HyperMetalLugia> Way too big

<Glacymr> 12?
<D_man> just sayin'
<Fish609> In the July 3rd, 2011 Equestria Daily post[1] that dealt with these socks, blogger Sethisto pointed out that they were “almost shaped like they would fit on hooves from this angle.” The very next day, DeviantArt user Egophiliac[2] drew the first known picture of a pony (Princess Luna) wearing socks[3].Subsequently, many other fan artists began drawing images of ponies wearing socks on their hooves.
<Xanbreon> 06Real men run over non moving objects

<RainDancer> "A lunatic may be 'soothed,' as it is called, for a time. But in the end, he is apt to become obstreperous. His cunning too is proverbial and great. If he has a project in view, he conceals his design with a marvelous wisdom; and the dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity presents to the metaphysician one of the most singular problems in the study
<RainDancer> of the mind. When a madman appears to be thoroughly sane, indeed, it is high time to put him in a straightjacket."

<Angel_Espeon> 13True LOL
<Luna> Well, I've tried it, but my sister said I suck
<Angel_Espeon> 13I was pretty desperate a couple years back though
<Angel_Espeon> 13I seriously lacked people to talk about it with
<ValtheJean> Welp, it is now official
<Luna> I don't mind the music, though it comes out of my sister's room so often that I'm sick of it
<Angel_Espeon> 13so i tried getting people into it
<ValtheJean> Dari has the hots for Pegacorn
<Angel_Espeon> 13I succeeded with a couple of people, but that's about it
*Ray pokes Angel, "has the upload finished? .-."
<Sakuya> Luna, when i tried, I failed miserably
<GGgala> dari's fetish is angry pegacorn?
<Denied_Existence> TIME TO WRITE SOME FANFICTION
<Sakuya> Why are you uploading it angel?
<Winter-puff> beep
<Angel_Espeon> 13then you and Aero and everyone found Touhou, and I was eternally happy |D
<Sakuya> Have him just download it lol
*Pegacorn jumps while running,propelling himself in the air and pulls out a katana
<Dermathil> STOP SAYING HIS NAME
<Pegacorn> DIE!
<Angel_Espeon> 13Because I can't be bothered finding a download link |D
*Pegacorn decends towards dari,katana pointing at him
<Angel_Espeon> 13Plus my copy has vsync and an English patch included
<Angel_Espeon> 13and stuff
<Sakuya> So youre wasting over 6 times the time
<Sakuya> Vsync?
<Pegacorn> DIEEEEEE!
*Pegacorn tries to stab dari
<Angel_Espeon> 13Yeah, for some reason MoF only plays at 50fps for me these days
<bromigo> is this censored chat?
<Dermathil> OH SNAP SON

<Blums> no, but its regulated

<Sakuya> Weird
<Pegacorn> Why was i kicked?
<bromigo> so no cursing?
<Angel_Espeon> 13I did the same for other games with that problem, like EoSD and PCB
<Dman> LOL *read up* *see dermathil herdminded*

<Sakuya> Huh
<DeniedExistence> Goddamn connection
<Pegacorn> FOR MY SANITY!
<bromigo> *goes to curse in response to lack of ability to curse*
<ValtheJean> against the power of mods, there can be no hope

<Dermathil> hehehe
*Dermathil brohoofs Dman.
<prince-dari> Dash?
<Sketch> hello again
<prince-dari> *Clop clop clop*
<Pegacorn> Running
<prince-dari> :P
<Sakuya> I'm glad aero got me introduced to this lol
<MrPoniator> yo
*Pegacorn pulls out a shotgun
<Sakuya> Yay bad apple
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ray, 15 minutes to go |D
<^Melody> Heya!
<bromigo> was expecting more than this...
*Pegacorn stops running,e-braking right in front of dari
<Barry> Did you know that Looker, from Pokemon Platinum, is actually a Lawyer-Friendly Cameo of The Doctor?
*Dman brohoofs Dermathil
<Dman> Sorry bro, i'm showing a friend FiM
<Blums> Well bromigo.. when it does get hectic its hard to follow anything
<Dermathil> no problem
<Angel_Espeon> 13First Touhou-related thing I ever saw was a video of scans from one of the doujins or something
<Angel_Espeon> 13then I had a friend who linked me to Marisa Stole the Precious Thing
<Sketch> So is anypony else riled up by this Verizon restricting tethering thing?
<Angel_Espeon> 13and yeah |D
<bromigo> ^^^^
<bromigo> yeah that's a load of BS
<Sketch> I hardly ever tether mind you, but the fact that they are doing it is really pissing me off
<MrPoniator> I'm no American, so care to elaborate as to what it is?
<Sakuya> I guess if I had actually listened to aero, I would played touhou like a year before
<CogWeaver> tether?
<Sakuya> But I was too lazy lol
<CogWeaver> what be that?
<GGgala> suddenly forehead zipper
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's where you use your mobile phone as a modem.
<Sketch> Tethering is a term used when you set up your smartphone to be a wifi hotspot
<Sketchy_Sounds> Basically.
<CogWeaver> oh
<Pegacorn> Dari,I NEED ANWSERS!
<CogWeaver> yeah, that sucks
<bromigo> you use your phone as a modem for your computer
<bromigo> basically
<Sketch> so you can connect your laptop/whatever to your cell and use 3g for your internet
<Sketchy_Sounds> My understanding is that some providers have taken a disliking to it.
<Angel_Espeon> 13The first time I ever saw Touhou gameplay, I remember thinking it looked boring and I wondered why it was so popular
<bromigo> yes
<prince-dari> I'm just messing around for the lulz.
<Pattyrick> brb, switching to iPod
<prince-dari> As I said. :P
<DeniedExistence> OHSHEET
<Sketch> now Verizon, being stupid, is saying that they want to charge you extra for tethering
<MrPoniator> Oh, a couple of my buddies do that
<bromigo> especially companies that provide both phone and internet
<Blums> all the providers in canada and the us are tyring to put in caps for internet usage
<Sathi> 7what the...
<Sathi> 7dat laugh
<Angel_Espeon> 13of course, the reason I downloaded it in the first place was to see if it was as boring as it looked to me
<Angel_Espeon> 13then I was hooked |D
<Pegacorn> SHIT JUST GOT REAL SON.
<Sakuya> The first game play I saw was mokou, I was scared
<Sketchy_Sounds> We already have them here in the UK.
<DeniedExistence> Your on ugly motherfucker
<Sketch> which is rediculous. If you are paying for the data, what right do they have to say how you distribute it on -your- hardware
<MrPoniator> Ah, so the fuzz is about paying exta for that?
<Dman> :O
<bromigo> verizon realizes that some hacker will figure out how to bypass whater security they put in place
<Angel_Espeon> 13Same, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if we saw the very same video xD
<DeniedExistence> ARM UP WOMAN
<Dermathil> GET THE KITCHEN KNIFE HOE

<Dman> Eh, i'm missing this for FiM. llesser of 2 evils i'm afraid :(
<Angel_Espeon> 13ohai Shiny :3
<Dman> OH ITS HIM
<Sketch> well yeah, you can packet spoof, but that doesn't fix the fact that they are being unethical
<Dman> that's y comments kicked off :P
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Hey Espy
<Pegacorn> Dem effects
<Sketchy_Sounds> Over here in the UK you can pay for being able to tether, I think.
<DeniedExistence> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU STANDING AROUND FOR!? OPEN FIRE ON THAT BITCH
<MrPoniator> hacker or cracker?
<AppleDash[ZorkIsSoConfusing]> !link http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/43257

<DesertRose> Fair Usage Policy taints every inch of brittish internet
<DeniedExistence> FEUER FREI!
<Dermathil> BABY FACE
<Sketch> they are double charging you for the same data because of functionality that they did not invent
<GGgala> no, not expendable extra!
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, Lambda and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>

<Sathi> 7suddenly LRAD
<Pegacorn> Dat seizure
<Sketchy_Sounds> Technically the data is not the same.
<Sketch> they make the argument that tethered users use a lot more data. Fine. but if you are using a capped plan their argument is irrelevant
<DeniedExistence> FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Sketch> it's capped, who cares how I use it
<Pegacorn> Dat titledrop
<Sketch> it is and it isn't, depends on what you are doing
<Winter-puff> cliff hander
<GGgala> sloooowmo
<Dermathil> PLAY PART 2!!!!!
<GGgala> braaaaaave neeeeewwww wwooooooorld
<Dermathil> AND STOP WITH THE FLIPPING SLOWMO AND FASTUP
<Sketch> I realize laptops tend to *chatter* and leave open connections
<DesertRose> In the UK, turning your router into a wireless hotspot for BT gets you money back from BT
<Sketch> but so does my phone when I use AndChat
<DeniedExistence> TO THE NEXT PART
<GGgala> mmm time-dilated doctor who
<Pegacorn> lol
<DeniedExistence> ALSO, STOP THE SKIPPING SHIT
<bromigo> it's because tech savvy super nerds
<bromigo> like myself
<bromigo> would buy unlimited cell phone plans
<bromigo> and then just tether
<bromigo> thus avoiding paying for additional internet access
<Pegacorn> LOOOL.
*Sketch has an old, grandfathered unlimited plan
<Glacymr> 12Shiny-Growlithe~~
*Glacymr tosses bread sticks

<Dermathil> POLARFIRE
<bromigo> nice
<Pegacorn> I'm pretty sure it's more then "Messing around" dari.
<Sketch> but I basically chat and read the news on my phone, and occassionally pandora. I really don't do much to "screw" verizon
<bromigo> they're a corporation
<DeniedExistence> prince-dari Reboot that shit!
<^Stargazer> oh wow, I didn't realise how easy Twilight's cuttie mark was to draw on her... I thought it was going to actually give me trouble lol
<DeniedExistence> DO EET
*Sathi 7is being hypnotized
<Dermathil> MUUUGEN PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANCHE
<bromigo> you "screw" them, just by existing and not being their slave
*Shiny-Growlithe catches and noms
<Sketch> glad it gave you no trouble there 'Stargazer
<prince-dari> What you try'na say Pegacorn?
<Sketch> lol, you are probably right bromigo
<DesertRose> they are making you pay for something they cant even provide service for
<Sketch> exactly
<Pegacorn> dari,don't lie.Lying is bad.
<GGgala> dat PREVIOUSLY ON
<Sketch> it's unethical to charge for something you did not create or have a hand in
<bromigo> ummm
<bromigo> verizon provides internet
<bromigo> outside of cellphones
<bromigo> so does AT&t
<Glacymr> 12how oges
<Glacymr> 12goes
<Sketch> true, but they did not make tethering apps
<Sketch> or the phone's ability to tether
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Recovering
<Denied_Existence> Them some ugly ass aliens
<Sketch> and we are already paying for 'net access
<Dman> OOO new episode?
<DracoSemiAway> Stargazer: That gives me hope... I am wanting to reproduce it in painted metal on the backs of a pair of leather gloves that I cut the fingers off of, and add in linked-on rings on each finger for the other 5 of the Mane Six.
<GGgala> Dman PART TWO
<Sketchy_Sounds> It's basically poor planning on their part at the end of the day.
<Denied_Existence> Fuck, my stream is being a dick
<Sketchy_Sounds> They didn't expect people to use their phones that way
<ValtheJean> hey DCD, are you there?
<Pegacorn> I think i know what you're REALLY thinking dari.
<Sathi> 7wut..?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Hence they didn't plan for the extra network traffic
<Denied_Existence> WHY WONT YOU PLAY DAMMIT!?
<Dermathil> SMEXY PICKLE
<GGgala> prince-trolli
<Sketchy_Sounds> So now they have to find a way to deal with it.
<prince-dari> Trololo
<Blums> Well if they find some disticnt reason to give you another bill...
<Dermathil> THEY ARE ALL TOGETHER
<Dermathil> THEY ARE ALL LINKED
<Dman> GGgala oh snap!
<Sketch> I dunno. Like I said, people on their phone already Hulu, youtube and pandora all day long
<Dman> it's auwn
<ValtheJean> well, maybe dari will know
<Sketch> how much more data are you really using when you tether?
<ValtheJean> so dari
<bromigo> exactly blums
<prince-dari> Yeah?
<Sketchy_Sounds> Perhaps, but they're doing that on connections optimised for a phone.
<Dermathil> DAT PIC
<ValtheJean> remember earlier today when DCD mentioned...*shudder* a certain person who recently announced being a brony?
<GGgala> lawl Mickey
<MirthTinker> heya bronies
<Sketchy_Sounds> And they're getting heavily compressed data.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So good
<GGgala> Val YES
<ValtheJean> howdy mirthtinker
<ValtheJean> so here's something on ponychan
<GGgala> now let us never speak of it again
<Pegacorn> Ohai MirthTinker
<ValtheJean> I'm not accusing ANYONE
<ValtheJean> but
<ValtheJean> maybe...
<SilverMane> ohai shipwrecker1
<ValtheJean> just maybe...
<SilverMane> !
<Sketch> still being trafficed through the device on the same network. I'm not sure I see the distinction in how the data necessarily changes
<ValtheJean> http://www.ponychan.net/chan/pony/res/35746360.html
<Sketchy_Sounds> Simple
<ValtheJean> it is possible this is him
<Pegacorn> What are you talking about ValtheJean?
<MirthTinker> shipwrecker1 makes me sound like a submarine :D
<ValtheJean> pegacorn, you don't want to know
<Sketchy_Sounds> When you browse the internet on a PC, you're using a user agent that requests the PC version of everything you go for.
<Sketch> additionally bronies: sorry for the rant topic :/
<Sakuya> Gonna go at sa again
<bromigo> rants are fun
<CogWeaver> ?
<Sakuya> Parseeeeee y u so annoying
<Sketch> ah, fair enough there, I did not think of that
*Ray yaaaaaaawns
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02All right
<Sketchy_Sounds> And pages for PCs are bigger due to larger stylesheets and images and lack of compression.
<Denied_Existence> FUCK
<bromigo> nothing important cna be discussed in less than 10 comments
<ValtheJean> I feel terrible in the event that it isn't
<Dermathil> AHAHAHA
<GGgala> DOHOHOHOHO
<Glacymr> 12hmm
<prince-dari> Oh God.
<Denied_Existence> STREAM, Y U NO WORK!?
<prince-dari> Not him.
<ValtheJean> but...it could be
<ValtheJean> and I'm concerned
<Denied_Existence> FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
<ValtheJean> concerned that he found ponychan
<ValtheJean> and has thus tainted it
*Dman is showing a nonbrony CMC talent show =D
<prince-dari> >tainted
<MirthTinker> that baby alien...thingie...is terrifying
<prince-dari> Implying it was good in the first place.
<prince-dari> :P
<Pegacorn> I DO want to know ValtheJean.
<Sketchy_Sounds> There is an absolute crapton of optimisation going on in the background when you're browsing the net on your phone or using a mobile app.
<bromigo> not really sketchy
<Denied_Existence> Why does my stream REFUSE TO WORK!?
<Locke> quick question
<Denied_Existence> FINALLY
<Dermathil> S.O.S
<Dermathil> SHOOT ON SIGHT
<Locke> Am I the only one who sees Scootaloo as an ophan?
<ValtheJean> there's...a particular sonic fan who...let's just say is bad....who is potentially on ponychan
<ValtheJean> again, I'm not outright acusing him
<Pegacorn> Bye guys,seeya tommorow.
<ValtheJean> because it's possible it's someone else
<Sketch> fair enough there Sketchy
<Pegacorn> Sonic fan?
<Sathi> 7@dman hows the conversion going?

<Crainy> hiho
<Dman> Good
<GGgala> ooh Margaret ooh
*Light_Latias huggles Shiny
<Dman> so far :P
<Dman> sorry for lack of talk
<Sathi> 7np
<SilverSonic> ohai LL o3o'
<Sathi> 7working on some stuff for you guys aswell
<bromigo> first off is the format
<Dman> =] w00t
<ReticentSmolder> i've never seen this Dr who and I'm terrified to know about wtf is going on here
<Denied_Existence> Dammit, I missed how Dr. Who made it out of the conference room...
<DesertRose> yay drawfriend
<Sketchy_Sounds> It depends on how lazy the designer of a site or whatever is, bro
<Dman> sadly, like about 99% of Granada, Spain, he doesn't really use the web
<DesertRose> about damn time
<Pattyrick> Back
<Sketchy_Sounds> Some designers will just be very lazy and only make a mobile stylesheet
<SilverSonic> ;o
<Dman> aka knows no memes / pop culture / anything
<Dman> Just facebook and youtube
<Sketchy_Sounds> That only works though if your site is well coded.
<Denied_Existence> I hate my computer
<Dman> but hey! show's coming to spain soon, so glad he's liking it :D
<Denied_Existence> Why does the stream keep stopping!?
<Denied_Existence> GRAAAAAAHHHH
<prince-dari> Maybe I'm streaming at too high kbps for you.
<Sketch> heh, I guess my argument is more about capped data plans. Sure, my tethered pc will get more data. but my data is still capped, why do you care how I use what's under that cap?
<prince-dari> I could lower it, see if that'll help.
<Sketch> except to be money-grubby
<Sketchy_Sounds> The more thoughtful designers will also look into making sure the thumbnails are set to compress to a nice small size so that using their site doesn't consume all your data.
<Denied_Existence> Also, can anyone enlighten me as to how the Doc made it out of the conference room?
<bromigo> ^^^^
<bromigo> that
<bromigo> yes
<GGgala> Denied, you mean the electric trouble or the guys with guns trouble in the conference room?
<Dermathil> loool
<Dman> hmm
<Dermathil> nice job at improvising
<Dman> try it dari
<Sketchy_Sounds> And yeah, that's an excellent point Sketch.
<Denied_Existence> prince-dari I don't think that is the problem
<DesertRose> time to change ISP i think
<prince-dari> Ok.
<DesertRose> no wait
<bromigo> was about to say then thumbnails and embeded files and programs are compressed
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ray, you there? :3
<Denied_Existence> The Electric part
<prince-dari> Stream's back up.
<bromigo> I have no ISP
<DesertRose> your talking about mobile internets arnt you?
<Blums> I think the ISPs work together on their plans... at least they seem to adopt the same policies near the same time
<prince-dari> He pulled off the ID card.
<prince-dari> And put it on one of the slitheen.
<Sketchy_Sounds> Yep @ DesertRose
<GGgala> also he had two hearts, it was only designed to kill one-hearted people
<Denied_Existence> And the others?
<GGgala> or something
<bromigo> well I do
<prince-dari> They're all linked.
<Dman> dat rape face
<prince-dari> So they all got shocked when he put it on one.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02.-.
<bromigo> but you can't buy it
<prince-dari> Ok Denied_Existence.
<prince-dari> See if this is better.
<Sketch> but yeah, mebbe is time to change to Sprint
<Dman> play it colt
<Dman> qualitee noticably lower : /
<Sketch> but I'm afraid they will do the same thing soon
<Dman> but hey! it's fine!
<Sketchy_Sounds> But yeah. Certainly charging you for the ability to tether makes no sense if your monthly data usage is already capped.

<Blums> gentlestallions?
<Angel_Espeon> 13And good luck~
<Sketchy_Sounds> It only makes sense when your usage is unlimited, because then as you pointed out you will use a crapton, and if a lot of people do it the network won't handle it too well.
<Roara|Touhou> thanks x.x
<Roara|Touhou> I forgot that even in easy
<Psyentific> And, if this wants to co-operate...

<Psyentific> eeyup
<Psyentific> I think you mean Pinkie Pie
*Sketchy_Sounds is a FLuttershy fan
<Blums> I dont like fluttershy =D
<Sketch> I'm ok with Fluttershy. She's middle packish for me
<prince-dari> DeniedExistence, is it better now?
<DeniedExistence> Yeah
<The_Crowing> Fluttershy? Thats a weird way to spell Rainbow Dash
<Angel_Espeon> 13Ok, PM time
<Sketchy_Sounds> But to be honest I like pretty much all of the cast.
<Blums> j/k, though she is last on my mane 6 list
<Dermathil> Polarfire
<prince-dari> Sometimes high quality kills the stream for some people.
<bromigo> I like quiet people
<Dermathil> We gotta talk to ya Polarfire
<prince-dari> Too much bandwidth required.
<Dman> : /
<Sketchy_Sounds> Fluttershy has masses of moe factor
<SilverMane> Polrafire
<bromigo> the animal loving/hippie side of her is meh thogh
<bromigo> though*

<DesertRose> RainbowDash? Oh you silly pony, thats not how you spell Luna
<Dman> Flame of the North star
<BlacklightShining> it makes no sense
<Sketchy_Sounds> So that's the game that has the good ships Salad Sandwich and Sketchy Sounds among your fleet then XD
<Psyentific> Yep
<The_Crowing> Rainbow Dash is so awesome that she automatically gets the first three places
<GGgala> antarctic inferno
<Glacymr> 12hi Light_Latias
<Psyentific> Though they may or may not be resting in the Chesepekedue to a botched naval blockade
<Blums> having one of the cmcs be one of your favourite ponies doesnt make you a pedo
<SilverMane> winter heat
<BlacklightShining> so is one instance of her actually Rainbow Dash (20% cooler) or something?
<Psyentific> Chesapeke Bay*
<Sketchy_Sounds> :<
<The_Crowing> Anyway getting off of ponies for a sec, anyone here a Coheed and Cambria fan like me?

<HyperMetalLugia> o.o
<Psyentific> Stars huh?
<Star_Lancer> Might as well join the crowd.
<Aponymous> >Ignore alien expert
<GGgala> they need to call in Ace, give her a baseball bat, and lock her in a room with it.
<Star_Lancer> Oh wait no underscore. That works for the better
<NewDCD> 9so, this is Torchwood?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<BlacknightShining> MY nick was already really close
<prince-dari> Doctor Who
<BlacknightShining> dontcha think?
<NewDCD> 9oh
<prince-dari> Torchwood is much more adult
<NewDCD> 9...I don't recognize this Doctor
<Starlancer> eeyep
<NewDCD> 9who is it?
<DracoSemiAway> I have no comet (sic) on these developments.
<prince-dari> Eccleston
<Dermathil> Eccleston
<prince-dari> 10th
<prince-dari> 9th*
<NewDCD> 9number I mean
<Aponymous> It's the 9th
<Starlancer> I c wut u did thar
<Cloudgazer> puuuuuns
<NewDCD> 9oh
<Dermathil> Tennant is 10
<BlacknightShining> ^.^
<Starlancer> Also, I suddenly have a hankering to play Crusader Kings
<Skylands> 10Misread for Exodius
<Skylands> 10One of the few YuGiOh names I remember
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<drf|laptop> 03I usually shout "exodus" when 3 or more people leave one after another
<NewDCD> 9fucking Daleks
<Cloudgazer> But yeah im an astronomy nerd thats studying to be an astrophysicist so I figured this name works
<Skylands> 10Why?
<NewDCD> 9SOMEONE GET KOUJI KABUTO IN THERE
<NewDCD> 9STAT
<NewDCD> 9A ROCKET PUNCH SHOULD SOLVE THIS
<prince-dari> Just one dalek.
<prince-dari> You wait DCd.
<prince-dari> DCD*
<Starlancer> Cloudgazer, I wish I was as nerdcool as you
<drf|laptop> 03because an exodus is a lot of people leaving?
<prince-dari> Some later episodes...
<Skylands> 10k
<prince-dari> XD
<Dermathil> LIGHTNING
<drf|laptop> 03it's like why Kyu used to say Ping or w/e
<Starlancer> Correction: I wish I could hack it in a /real/ science
<drf|laptop> 03when there was a ping timeout
<Denied_Existence> INTERESTING STRATEGY
<Winter-puff> lol ownd
<NewDCD> 9>yfw you're imagining Daleks in SRW
<GGgala> looks like the Dalek plays Magicka
<Starlancer> Comp Sci major here
<prince-dari> That would be awesome.
<Cloudgazer> Comp sci is too complicated for me man
<Dermathil> the Daleks INVENTED magicka.
<Cloudgazer> jesus
<Xiagu> hard sciences sort of suck for jobs though
<Starlancer> Eh. It's satisfying as all get out though.
<GGgala> the Daleks are Scandinavian! OF COURSE
<Cloudgazer> Yeah theres about 3 job vacancies for my course
<Cloudgazer> and they are all with nasa so thats one hell of a journey for a job
<Xiagu> i see you like ending sentences in though too though
<killerrabbit> comp science is too theoretical imo
<Starlancer> Wrestling with a computer for a week straight, then FINALLY getting it working is the best feeling.
<killerrabbit> doesn't teach practical programming, what you really do
<Cloudgazer> you could always try reformatting
<Starlancer> I'd agree.
<Cloudgazer> if its windows
<Starlancer> Cloudgazer, why would you sign on with Nasa?
<Starlancer> That ship is sinking.
<killerrabbit> although the data structures class I took was useful, but not much else
<Starlancer> Go private, or go with the Europeans or something.
<NewDCD> 9I always have trouble understanding what the Daleks said
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02lmao
<pinkie> any one wanna talk about bg ponys
<Cloudgazer> They are sinking apart from the 9 proposals that they have for new reusable deep space craft?
<prince-dari> "Then what should I do"
<Cloudgazer> Best background pony is applejack
<drf|laptop> 03?
<Cloudgazer> (dont hit me)
<killerrabbit> ^^lol
<prince-dari> "The daleks must survive"
<Starlancer> They axed the shuttle without having a replacement in service. That seems like a bad move
<Starlancer> Plus, I just don't have a good feeling about them.
<prince-dari> "You would make a good dalek"
<Blums> background pony
<Nuclear> NASA!
<Dermathil> DAT LINE
<Blums> since when wa applejack demoted?
<killerrabbit> Starlancer: satalites don't require maintenance, right? lulz
<Cloudgazer> They had it up for being axed for a year
<Nuclear> FTW!
<Cloudgazer> it was meant to be closed down last year
<Dermathil> CHILLING
<Dermathil> and I LOVE it.
<BlacklightShining> Applejack is one of the Mane Six!
<Cloudgazer> They had to finish the ISS first
<stripes> great!..prince-dari, THE INTERPRITER lol
<BlacklightShining> satellites*
<prince-dari> XD
<Starlancer> Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that all they have is proposals.
<killerrabbit> what's the point of the ISS if we can't get to it?
<Cloudgazer> Satellites need to be boosted every now and then due to trace atmosphere
<pinkie> whats demoted mean
<Starlancer> Yep
<Cloudgazer> Have you heard of the russian soyuz?
<stripes> hehe g'day all..
<Cloudgazer> thats how they are getting up there right now
<Starlancer> Okay, this is confusing and I want my name back
<Nuclear> YEs
<BlacklightShining> pinkie: some authority was revoked
<pinkie> ok
<Blums> uhhh.. to have their standing changed to a lower rank
<BlacklightShining> in this context, it means a character became less important
<Cloudgazer> And NASA isnt just spaceflight
<NewDCD> 9sup Stripes
<Blums> yeah
<Cloudgazer> I want to work with the telescopes
<killerrabbit> Cloudgazer: well yeah, but that's russia, and not the US -.-
<pinkie> can we talk bg ponys alredy
<BlacklightShining> someponies are apparently saying Applejack was demoted from a Mane character to a background pony
<Cloudgazer> But your astronauts are going up in soyuz
<BlacklightShining> (apparently) *
<killerrabbit> Colgate is best background pony
<NewDCD> 9O SHIT
<Blums> Berry punch is best bg pony
<prince-dari> You gon' die.
<prince-dari> EXTERMINATE!
<Cloudgazer> Roseluck is the prettiest bg pony
<prince-dari> EXTERMINATE!
<pinkie> derpy is the best bg pony
<Silverscreen> what dis?
<NewDCD> 9ROSE
<stripes> not alot, enjoying the dr
<NewDCD> 9CQC THAT DALEK
<Winter-puff> hugs?
<NewDCD> 9PUNCH THE SHIT OUT OF HIM
<killerrabbit> Cloudgazer: hmm, apparently I missed that, I guess canceling the space shuttle program isn't so bad then
<BlacklightShining> they're all good ponies
<prince-dari> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.gif
<Psyentific> Princess Luna is the best BG pony
<BlacklightShining> …WTF
<Dermathil> Dalek shall demonstrate compassion.
<Blums> Lyra, Berry, Bonbon, Cherilee
<BlacklightShining> Luna should be a minor character!
<Dermathil> Dalek Exterminated the camera
<Cloudgazer> And proposals in space flight have a habit of clearing up quickly
<prince-dari> Shh no spoilers.
<Psyentific> Agreed, but right now she's BG
<Cloudgazer> I mean you got from the wright brothers to the space shuttle in like 60 years
<Dermathil> oh, so I called it right?
<BlacklightShining> >:(
<Dermathil> (never saw the episode)
<prince-dari> I'm just saying, no spoilers.
<prince-dari> :P
<Silverscreen> 11What are we watching?

<BlacklightShining> wb DJMidli|Working

<GGgala> well that was a dumb line
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Lol don't worry
<killerrabbit> I don't think they will ever release a gilda toy
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Not laughing at you or anything

*Jazza sips some wine and says "Octavia... play us a song won't you dear"
<Colgate> hihello
<Jazza> I don't actually have wine
<Pizzicato> I do!
<GGgala> holy shit a giant hookah
<Jazza> Well lucky you
<Pyroh> Hello Octavia
<Colgate> I have some boxed wine...
<Pizzicato> I have some chardonnay, it's awful.
<Paintsplash> All I got is water.
<Jazza> Oh yes, I have some boxed wine too... somewhere
<Pizzicato> Chardonnay is disgusting.
<Furril> I keep up a modest spreadsheet of links

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Such a cute Braviary picture
<Jazza> I don't drink wine so I'll say.... YES
<Pizzicato> I think it's about getting drunk.
<^Stargazer> good night everypony, sweet dreams!
<Colgate> Octavia: no, not really, but it is dirt cheap for the alcohol content -.-
<Jazza> I'm more of a spirits / premix type of drinker
<Aurora> link
<Pizzicato> Like, wine has an alcohol content of 10%+, usually.
<Pizzicato> Beer is like, 4.5-6.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02http://images.cheezburger.com/completestore/2011/7/11/50c30349-b723-40ee-bcd1-f547bb3cc4e1.jpg
<Pizzicato> So, if you want to get drunk faster, wine!
<Jazza> Vodka is like 40%+
<Colgate> same Jazza, I mostly drink liquers
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Maybe just cute in my eyes though XD
<Pyroh> Beep :3
<Pizzicato> Or Jäger.
<drf|laptop> 03that's not cute at al
<Aurora> OH GOD

<Shiny-Growlithe> 02IKR? <3
<Colgate> vodka is what I drink when I want to get drunk fast
<drf|laptop> 03marwhat
<Aurora> from rescuers down under
<Jazza> Yeah
<Pizzicato> I go for Jäger and cheap wine, but whatever, I'm not an alcohol snob.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02The golden eagle
<Pizzicato> I'm in it to get drunk.
<Jazza> I turned up at a party 3 hours late and binged vodka just to get drunk
<Pyroh> Jesus what
<Colgate> smirnoff 100 proof, got a 1.75L jug for 30$, lol
<Pizzicato> I don't think any of it tastes very good.

<killerrabbit> I have a friend that makes this apple/cinamon stuff
<Pyroh> Cinnabon?!
<killerrabbit> it's really good, can't even taste the alcohol in it when sober
<Octavia> Mmm, cinnamon.
<killerrabbit> and it is strong too, like ~140 proof
<Octavia> yea, that is how our moonshine tastes
<Pyroh> lol
<Pyroh> When sober
<Pyroh> What happens when you arent
<killerrabbit> hey, being drunk makes a big difference!
<Octavia> You are face down in the dirt?

<GGgala> it's anime science, they ain't gotta explain shit

<GGgala> what about that new cartoon... bio-something?
<NewDCD> 9sym-bionic titan?
<NewDCD> 9not a bad idea
<NewDCD> 9not a bad idea at all
<GGgala> yeah that
<Dave_BroZilla> Question: Are there any live-action mech movies outside of Transformers around?
<Dave_BroZilla> I know there's Real Steel coming out the weekend of my Birthday
<killerrabbit> so... am I the only one who uses empty liquor bottles as decorations?
<NewDCD> 9remember that these series will eventually be over
<GGgala> we can see the latest and the oldest all together
<NewDCD> 9so the lineup will go changing every once in a while
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02The HML clone was really a secret agent holding Espeon hostage!
<Dave_BroZilla> Tis understandable
<NewDCD> 9what I don't know
<Dave_BroZilla> Hell, I got all three seasons of Megas on my HDD already, plus soudntrack
<Pyroh> ...
<NewDCD> 9is something I still got to decide
<NewDCD> 9okay
<NewDCD> 9there are shows like Gravion
<RobotPinkie> but it's only anime and no tokusatsu?
<Pyroh> I fill mine with Melted tree's
<Pyroh> Does that count?
<NewDCD> 9it's only Giant Robots
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Anywho gotta restart the comp
<HyperMetalLugia> I know, but I dealt with him :>
<Blums> I heard someone used old AoL disks for christmas decorations on their tree
<NewDCD> 9Tokusatsu is for my preshows yo
<RobotPinkie> I guess that makes sense
<NewDCD> 9plus I'll eventually host Toku Events
<NewDCD> 9just got to find the time for it
<killerrabbit> uh, what's a melted tree? o.O
<Paintsplash> the best use for AOL discs I've heard of.
<NewDCD> 9anyways
<NewDCD> 9shows like Gravion
<Pyroh> paper
<Pyroh> Duh
<killerrabbit> AOL discs made for good coasters
<NewDCD> 9it has a 13-episode first season
<NewDCD> 9then there's season 2, Gravion Zwei
<killerrabbit> although my current coaster is a hdd platter
<NewDCD> 9I'm wondering whether to just have S2 take these show's timeslots
<RobotPinkie> Same with Big-O?
<Pyroh> Hey
<NewDCD> 9or take the timeslot for something else, and later on stream said S2
<Blums> Just be careful if it's made of glass
<Pyroh> What are Moltov's made of?
<NewDCD> 9basically doing seasonal play here as well
<killerrabbit> Blums: the hdd platter???
<MrPoniator> Apparently I didn't go to bed at all
<NewDCD> 9not waiting a whole season for a continuation, mind you
<Blums> yeah
<Blums> some of them are made of glass
<NewDCD> 9but something around the same lenght
<NewDCD> 9*length
<NewDCD> 9air it in the time slot
<MrPoniator> Or, I tried, but couldn't get any sleep even after a hour of waiting
<NewDCD> 9and later on replace it with S2 of the original show
<NewDCD> 9which do you guys prefer?
<NewDCD> 9back-to-back, or season play?
<Paintsplash> I don't think I've ever seen that.
<killerrabbit> uh, it is very much metal, and I have never heard of a glass hdd
<Dave_BroZilla> Hmm...
<Blums> well.. it acts like glass when it breaks
<Paintsplash> Well, that sounds like a serious design flaw
<Dave_BroZilla> I'm partial towards back-to-back, but I know all to well what it means to have too much of a good thing
<Pyroh> So
<killerrabbit> can glass even be magnetic?
<Flareon> hi Sheena
<NewDCD> 9the first option allowsus to enjoy a full run of a show directly
<SheenaFox> hi Flareon
<RobotPinkie> I'm not sure how many times I'll be able to be here for it, so
<Blums> its nto actually glass but breaks like glass
<NewDCD> 9the second option allows us to have a bigger variety of shows
<Flareon> how are you?
<SheenaFox> good
<SheenaFox> you?
<Dave_BroZilla> You know, I think more variety might be a good thing
<killerrabbit> well, as long as I don't slam things on it, I think it'll be fine
<Paintsplash> why wold they make an HDD that breaks like glass?
<Pyroh> ...
<Dave_BroZilla> We're a fickle bunch, us bronies. Not everything is always to our tastes, aha
<Pyroh> Bye
<Pyroh> !lullaby
<MrPoniator> HDD aren't supposed to be treated like that anyway
*DerpyBot carries Pyroh off to bed
*DerpyBot tucks Pyroh in and hums a lullaby
<Flareon> feeling ok. Just got through reading more on the riots in UK and came on here
<AtomicBrony> Who has quit?
<AtomicBrony> Well, we're screwed.
<Paintsplash> ?
<Blums> It's just a side effect, Hdds arent made to be broken...
<Paintsplash> !muffin
<DerpyBot> Muffins!! You have any? :3
<Paintsplash> yes
<DerpyBot> Thank you!!
*DerpyBot glomps Paintsplash
<killerrabbit> Blums: true that, but it was giving me the click of death, so decided to make something uesful out of it :D
<NewDCD> 9I'm also thinking of adding Beast Wrs o the lineup eventually
<GGgala> yeah, switching up between seasons i like
<NewDCD> 9that, as well as Getter and Shin Mazinger
<GGgala> Beast Wars, yesssss...
<NewDCD> 9Gurren Lagann and EVA will only make appearances with their movies
<NewDCD> 9they're too manestream to air the full shows xD
<Pizzicato> Huh.
<drf|laptop> 03It was the first to broadcast the innuendo-based Rainbow clip, featuring Zippy and George singing a highly dubious song - this was originally done on a "christmas tape" for Thames Television employees only, just for a laugh. Victor managed to get it on TV Offal, but neglected to explain its context. Thus, we have a lot of people who think it's a 'real' Rainbow clip, especially when someone mpegged it from TV Offal a
<drf|laptop> 03xD
<GGgala> you mean the Rebuild movie right?
<Pizzicato> My tumblr post about the use of 'brony' has actually started a discussion http://doctormowinckel.tumblr.com/post/8703583063/the-term-brony
<killerrabbit> quit party!
<Blums> Mine just makes a really loud high pitched whine from time to time
<NewDCD> 9yeah
<Pizzicato> BLUMS THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID YEAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<GGgala> End of Evangelion in isolation would just be weird
<GGgala> thought so
<Pizzicato> That doesn't even make sense.

<Dragoran> And I posted logs anyway

<GGgala> ahaha trollizard, i remember that guy
<Barry> I think anyway
<Flamerunner> Okay i'll take it.

<Dragoran> also, indos ;_;
<Flamerunner> vertibirds.
<Dragoran> they found the BNC service and now i'm ready to buttfuck them
<RePod> wat

<Paintsplash> Can I send the error report?
<Altair> soon to be my new ride
<SillyNilly> Nuke it Octavia.
<Blums> Why did you give Flamerunner 8388608 bits? he only asked for 1000
<Octavia> i never finished that game because of that.
<Dragoran> haha
*Octavia had extra!
<Altair> DARE ME NOT TO
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You're gonna be sitting on the back of that while someone drives?
<Paintsplash> I can't vouch for vegas, but 3 was alot of fun.
<Blums> (yes i took out my calculator for that)
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Makes sense, sure it's the only way to drag around a Lugia
<Altair> no, i'm gonna be carrying it around
<Dragoran> Altair could fly though
<Paintsplash> then again...I played in on xbox...I'm not part of the glorious PC gaming race.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Make sure to get a really big seat belt back there
<Altair> duh @_@
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02LIES
<Dragoran> he'll be dragging it along
<Dragoran> and then drop it on his school
<Octavia> fo3 crashes all the time for me
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Lol
<Altair> Damn you for giving me quality ideas
<Flamerunner> Thank you Octavia
<Altair> :(
<Dragoran> lmao
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I want to see
*Flamerunner gives Octavia a kiss in the cheek and leaves to Mars.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Planet of the Apes :E
*SillyNilly wishes he had fingers to pry the bottlecap off of his chilled Nuka Cola, so he bites down on the cap instead, leaving it partially deformed after prying it off
*AtomicBrony installs Inkscape, pretends to be an artist
*Octavia giggles
<Paintsplash> Thats why I don't play on PC, well that and my lack of a game capable PC...

<Altair> ba dum tssh
<Paintsplash> Minecraft chugs a bit on this thing
<Octavia> the minecraft xbox thing i bought was terrible
<Blums> Minecraft isnt really optimized yet
<drf|laptop> 03hi Ascendant
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I dunno how to work torrents XD
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02They're so hard to get
<drf|laptop> 03but yes, AT&T does suck
<Altair> nah :P
<MrPoniator> It's funny how ridicilously heavy the game is, despite how it looks
<Paintsplash> I can imagine it would be.
<killerrabbit> MrPoniator: it is coded in java, nough said
*Flamerunner starts burning a giant heart in Mars with his ability, make green fire while running or flying at very high speed
<Blums> Its horrible if you play it in firefox
<Altair> all you gotta do is download utorrent, open the file you download from the torrent site with it, and you're off
<Xiagu> Sort of like Dwarf Fortress, right?
<MrPoniator> Yeah, I know
<Altair> but i totally don't condone piracy.
<Altair> totally
<Blums> Yep, 3d dwarf fotresss
<Blums> Though i think it's simpler
<Dragoran> XD
<Octavia> Flamerunner, captain subtlety.
<Dragoran> anyway brb
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Wait
<MrPoniator> Java is kind-of cool, since it allows the game to be ported easily, but other than that it's not really meant for gaming
<Dragoran> class shit
<Xiagu> I'm pretty sure DF is way more complicated than mincraft
*Shiny-Growlithe makes Altair a pirate's hat
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02There we go
<Altair> http://raleigh.craigslist.org/ctd/2531259136.html < do want

<Xiagu> the dwarves have fricking eyelids. they can get their eyelids damaged. they have SOCKS.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And we're having the most spectacular party ever
<Blums> yeah I meant minecraft, sorry if that wasnt clear
<killerrabbit> java is great in theory, but yeah........
*Flamerunner comes back
<Altair> and you're crashing the party v__v
<Octavia> socks = ultimate win.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh snap
<Flamerunner> A gift for you Octavia.
<Barry> Hi, Polar
<MrPoniator> Only if Java wasn't so slow
*Octavia wiggles her hoofiesocks. yay.
*Flamerunner bows.
<Polarfire> ohai
*Altair puts on said hat and breakdances
<SilverSonic> I am not V-v
<Altair> oh?
<Altair> well as long as you brought beverages
<Altair> you're OK
<Polarfire> Is anyone else still here?
<Barry> @strongmeter Jayden
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Jayden is 80% strong. (1393)
<Blums> Least it wasnt written in flash
*SilverSonic has a shit ton of soda
<Polarfire> besides GGgala
*Octavia whispers to Flamerunner, "That was entirely unnessecary, though sweet."
<Barry> Not that I know of
<Altair> that works
<Altair> :3
<Octavia> flash gets a side-pardon in the room.
<MrPoniator> I can tolerate Flash better than Java, though
*Flamerunner smiles
<Flamerunner> I still wanted to do it.
<Polarfire> ah.
<Flamerunner> You deserved it.
<Barry> @Pony Jayden
<Steven_Magnet> 6 Jayden is 5Little Strong7heart
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02No
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I can't drink soda :U
<SilverSonic> what do you drink Shineh
<Altair> beer
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Well that is what we make here XD but usually just juice and powerades(gatorades)
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02And tons of milk
*SilverSonic gives Juice to Shineh
*Shiny-Growlithe gulps it down
<Altair> that's like
<Altair> exactly what i drink
<SilverSonic> XD
<Altair> milk and gatorade
<Altair> plus other things.
<mook> there's psp emu written in java, it's authors claim that java can be just as fast as c
<mook> i have no reason to not believe them
<MrPoniator> lol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02If I could drink soda I would drink Dr. Pepper
<Altair> ^ best soda
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02^
*SilverSonic has that soda
<Blums> They should write it in assembler, then debug it for the rest of their mortal lives
<Altair> even though i work under pepsico
<Altair> but whatthehellever
<Octavia> guhhh.
<mook> asm is not xplatform
<SilverSonic> PEPSI = WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
<Altair> nah
<killerrabbit> java is not as fast as C -.-
<Altair> :P
<Blums> Well yes theres that problem mook
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Now I crave Dr. Pepper
<SilverSonic> so, Dr. Pepper = Win?
<Altair> yessir
<Octavia> ogre-python. lulz.
<mook> sdl-python
<Blums> an entire game in javascript
*SilverSonic drinks 2 pops at once then smashes the cans together
<SilverSonic> ;3
*MrPoniator stares at Unity JavaScript
<Dragoran> never tried Dr Pepper
<Dragoran> Actually I tried a bit
<Dragoran> it tastes weird
<SilverSonic> ^
<Octavia> javascript linux? http://bellard.org/jslinux/
<Dragoran> [15:19] <SilverSonic> o_______________O Holy crap, only the 3 founders are talking [15:19] <Shiny-Growlithe> And we're having the most spectacular party ever [15:19] <Altair> and you're crashing the party v__v
<Dragoran> haha
<killerrabbit> any interpereted language is going to be slower than a compiled language
<Dragoran> we are actually alive ya know :p
<SilverSonic> All i could see was like <~nickhere> line after line
<Altair> dr pepper has a hint of cherry
<Altair> i think
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It's more surprising to hear from Altair and me though
<Altair> ^
<mook> python is nice, it's a shame that my college switched to c#
<SilverSonic> NS isnt that surprising, you 2 pretty much
<Larscis> My goldfish plans to place a Saiga 12 where Pinkie Pie will find it and see what happens.
<mook> teaching proprietary tech is gross
<killerrabbit> mook: I've heard good things about ython, but I jsut can't get into it
<killerrabbit> the whole, white space is important, thing is just... too weird to me
<mook> yeah, took me some time to get used to it
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I need to make this Captain of the Seas picture
<mook> !link
<DerpyBot> http://arch.413chan.net/1292955980253-(n1293713950669).jpg
*Paintsplash has nothing to add.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02NS is always on the chat
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02It's more surprising when she gets on the forums/cbox
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Unlike me where I'm almost always on the cbox
<Dragoran> yeah dr pepper tastes like cherry coke
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Altair is just a surprise in a box
<Xiagu> Aww, lookit dem. Adowable.
<killerrabbit> hmm, apparently xchat doesn't recognize parathensis as being part of a link
<Blums> You could always add ponies paintsplash
<AtomicBrony> D'aaaaawwwwww.
<Altair> you know you love me
<Altair> ^_______________________^
<Xiagu> killerrabbit, whose IRC client has more features now lol?
<Paintsplash> I don't feel right arbitrarily steering the conversation...
<PsychicKid> This is depressing
*SilverSonic has never used the cbox
<SilverSonic> ;o
<Xiagu> I guess if you count bugs as features yours has the same number :D
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Oh yes
<killerrabbit> hey now, that's like, 1 minor thing
<killerrabbit> and since it is open source, I could change it!
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Exactly
<Paintsplash> I envy those who know about programming though
<killerrabbit> which... I just might
<SilverSonic> SHINY is more FLOOOOOOOOOOOOOFY <3
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02<3
<Paintsplash> most I can do is crap and a half websites.
<PsychicKid> All I want for my birthday is a damn book and it costs $40 to ship
<killerrabbit> what book?
<Dragoran> actually
<SilverSonic> Altair is just.....well...idk, just Altair i guess.
<PsychicKid> http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E9%A6%AC%E8%B6%8A%E5%98%89%E5%BD%A6-%E6%9D%B1%E6%98%A0%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%AF%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9-%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%A1%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%82%A2%E7%B7%A8%E9%9B%86%E9%83%A8/dp/4758012210/ This one
<Dragoran> it's more surprising to see me do things
<Dragoran> other than nothing
<killerrabbit> that's a lot of hex numbers!
<Xiagu> PsychicKid, that sucks :c also, JAPANESE
<Paintsplash> Oh, happy early bday...or bday....or late bday
<Paintsplash> and...thats a link.
<PsychicKid> It seriously blows my effing mind that it costs $40 to ship a book
<Paintsplash> its a mess
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Nah
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02NS you do things, we just don't see it.
<killerrabbit> 40$ for shipping? wow
<killerrabbit> what a ripoff
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02So it's surprising to actually hear you accomplished something
<Paintsplash> Perhaps you could dig up a PDF version?
<PsychicKid> Hah.
<Paintsplash> I mean, nothing beats cracking open a book.
<PsychicKid> Yeah maybe on Share.
<mook> nothing will replace the real thing
<PsychicKid> But good luck getting connected to Share in the US
<killerrabbit> I can't read books on my comp, anything longer than 5 pages, it just isn't happening
<mook> get yourself a kindle or something
<PsychicKid> Also the book's like 2-3 weeks old
<Xiagu> I've read a whole book on the computer actually.
<PsychicKid> A pdf likely doesn't exist
<Dragoran> orly
<Paintsplash> Well, nothing beats cracking open a full reference book...
<PsychicKid> Man I want to like punch a goat or something
<Dragoran> I just complain to Altair about most things
<Xiagu> Now that I think of it it's not that much different from fanfic aaaand oh wait you're the person who reads fanfic on their ebook.
<Dragoran> especially regarding the forum
<Paintsplash> but I had to get several in PDF for the time being...
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02I complain to you who complains to Altair
<killerrabbit> I read fanfics on my nintendo DS
<Dragoran> since he set it up and I didn't and I have no fucking idea where he puts everything
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02MANLY
<PsychicKid> The worst part is is it's effing amazon
<Xiagu> ....right! that
<PsychicKid> Amazon has 1 copy
<killerrabbit> if that counts as en ebook :P
<PsychicKid> All the other places listed through Amazon that have them are all like
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02~squee
<PsychicKid> "LOL CANNOT SHIP TO THIS ADDRESS"

*stripes is still here
<SilverSonic> LOL I didnt notice LL had the WB script
<PsychicKid> And I told them it was $35, not realizing that Amazon screws you on shipping

*Colgate has "everyone" set to auto replace with everypony
<Polarfire> I think I like it better with all the ponies in just 1 series
<Barry> Call of the Cutie was intended to be the Poorly Disguised Pilot for that new series
<mook> xiagu made an exception for himself, of course
<Blums> I never type everypony in conversations with bronies unless I try... but I have to stop myself when conversing with non bronies
<Polarfire> lol
<AtomicBrony> Prominence:
<Paintsplash> I have to prevent myself from using everypony in skype chats
<AtomicBrony> u there?
<Xiagu> Well, the quote was just everyone
<Barry> And the series would have been aimed at an even younger demographic.
<Xiagu> so... it would have been inaccurate...
<Colgate> inaccuracy... schmaccuracy
<Colgate> which makes no sense at all
<GGgala> that explains the "suddenly two new characters we've never met before" ending
<Octavia> i have text-replace set, so i just type everypony and my client changes it (every-one)
<Colgate> why is it when you're drunk, half of your thoughts are about how drunk you are? I don't get it
<Blums> It's the neurotoxin. it's taunting you
<mook> dawg
<Prominence> Hm?
<Barry> Actually, those two other characters were given early bird cameos in episode 1
<AtomicBrony> Just wonderin' how you're doin'
<Colgate> neurotoxin? don't use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue
<AtomicBrony> And how "work" is going
<GGgala> yeah, but not really... established
<Prominence> Been better on both counts.
<Prominence> I'll leave it at that.
<Barry> True
<Blums> You're not applejack
<AtomicBrony> Gotcha
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Sethisto: Story: Endless Gifts (http://tinyurl.com/3e3b824)
<GGgala> their introduction in CotC would make sense in a pilot... but was absurdly awkward in an ongoing series
<Unidentified20473> Neurotoxin? Don't use your fancy organic chemistry to muddy the issue.
<GGgala> where they aren't going to be in the next episode
<Barry> Only time will tell if they'll adapt the planned series, or change it into a series about the Mane 6 as fillies
<Octavia> dont let your fancy issues muddle the math. i am doing this wrong, are i not?
<Fluttershy> hi
<Pizzicato> Close enough.
<GGgala> ...not sure if want
<Pizzicato> That's something Twilight would say, probably to Rarity.
<AtomicBrony> Don't use your fancy muddles to issue the mathematics.
*Octavia laugh
<Pizzicato> Oh shit son.
<Pizzicato> I mean, poop.
<Pizzicato> oh poop song.
<SilverSonic> ohai Drake o3o
<Pizzicato> OH GOD I SWORE
<Pizzicato> SON
<Drake> 04hey SS
<Pizzicato> NOT SONG!
<AtomicBrony> There's a low-tolerance level for it.
<Flamerunner> Desu.
<Coz> Poop.......
<Pizzicato> You ever smell your armpits a few hours after you showered just to go 'ew'?
<Coz> >,>
<Barry> If they adapt the former, we can expect to see much more of Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon, as well
<Polarfire> yeah. let's hope they get season 2 over and done with before they break off with another series.
<AtomicBrony> Horseapples
<Pizzicato> Horseapples, that's a good one.
<GGgala> >mane 6 as filles
<AtomicBrony> That's what Rainbow Dash uses in "Fall Weather Friends"
<GGgala> how would that even work? they have established first meetings already
<Blums> seems more like an applejack euphamism
<AtomicBrony> And it's connotation is EXACTLY what you interpret it to be.
<Barry> True
<GGgala> it's not like The Muppet Show
<AtomicBrony> "OH SHI--"
<Pizzicato> Dash is a jerk. Like, Dash is just a jerk, that's why she hangs out with Gilda.
<Barry> lol
<Pizzicato> 'cause they're both jerks.
<Xiagu> Dash is sometimes not a jerk!
<Pizzicato> Haha.
<Blums> Ones slightly less jerky
<AtomicBrony> Applejack's is "What the hay"
<Pizzicato> Yeah like once a week.
<Polarfire> There's a lot more potential for something like a spin off series later on vs. right now.
<Xiagu> She's pretty jerky in FWF though...
<Polarfire> I mean not spin off.
<Polarfire> you know what I mean XD
<Blums> also jerky at the end of ticketmaster
<Xiagu> she's also a big dick in Dragonshy...
<Pizzicato> Yeah and in like 25 other episodes.
<Barry> yeah
<Pizzicato> The only time Dash wasn't a dick was with the Shadowbolts.
<Xiagu> Blums, that's amusingly jerky though.
<Blums> "But the rainbow one kicked me" *rainbow nods contently*
<Pizzicato> And she was like 'Later, bros!'
<Octavia> i like bad girls, so they are good with me.
<Pizzicato> Pfft, bad girl? Like, what does she do that's so bad?
<Barry> I just can't shake this feeling that Season 2 could end up being Darker and Edgier than Season 1, since Hasbro knows about all the older fans
<Xiagu> I was thinking more the intolerance of Fluttershy
<Pizzicato> Spits apples in peoples faces then grins?
<Pizzicato> 'cause she did that.
<Polarfire> I know that feel bro
<Xiagu> ``but the rainbow one kicked me'' *nod* is one of my favorite parts actually :D
<Polarfire> but I think its all good.
<Polarfire> for season 2 atleast.
<Pizzicato> Lookit! http://doctormowinckel.com/pictures/mlp/dash_is_kind_of_a_dick.gif
<Octavia> because most jerks are.. bad?
<Pizzicato> She just spits apples at people.
<Pizzicato> Who even does that?
<Polarfire> beyond that.... who knows.
<Colgate> spits apples? wut?
<Steven_Magnet> 12 Hello, GGgala_ and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Xiagu> Dash comes through when she has to though
<Pizzicato> AJ doesn't seem to mind, she was like 'Wtf you son of-ooooooh apple!'
*drf|laptop wonders if using that face was really necessary
<Blums> Well I'll be going now, its late soo..... bye
<GGgala_> crap. internet derped
<Polarfire> I doubt it will change that much though.
<AtomicBrony> l8r Blu--
*AtomicBrony missed.
<Colgate> BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
*Colgate /QQs
<Pizzicato> Laterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
<Paintsplash> b ye
<Barry> Yeah, I guess. I mean they wouldn't go from sunshine and rainbows to violence and blood
<Paintsplash> whoops
<Paintsplash> spacebar
<AtomicBrony> He didn't waste much time.
<Pizzicato> I wanna meet this AJ in the rl so we can buy apples and whatever like ponies or whatever AJ's into http://doctormowinckel.com/pictures/mlp/this_AJ.png
<BlacklightShining> (darnit!)
<BlacklightShining> (missed a chance for an inb4)
<Colgate> inb4 inbr
<Colgate> inb4*
<AtomicBrony> inb4 *
<Polarfire> Lauren wrote, or was involved in, all the season 2 scripts so season 2 is pretty much going to be like the first as far as plot and stuff
<Jazza> inb4 inb4
<Colgate> inb4 inb4 inb4
<BlacklightShining> ( ‘inb4 Xiagu is kicked by Rainbow Dash with reason ‘NOW the rainbow one has kicked you’ ’ )
<Jazza> NOOOOOOO

<BigMacintosh|SortingPonyFolder> 4735 images left to sort
<Drake> 04SHINY

*Shiny-Growlithe hugs back
<mook> !link
<DerpyBot> http://i.imgur.com/q5soj.gif
<Polarfire> There will probably be a few shoutouts and stuff for us (like derpy) but for the most part..... it should be the same.
<stripes> well as lomng as the animation and the look of the characters stay the same
<Polarfire> That's guranteed :)
<Barry> I'm sure they will
<BlacklightShining> CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS MIND READERS! YAAAAAAY!!
*Xiagu is so proud of himself
<stripes> when another company trying to do the same thing...ya never know what changes could happen
<Barry> The question is, if they do a Season 3, will they stay the same?
<Colgate> BlacklightShining: that would have been so funny, but yet so wrong
<Polarfire> The characters?
<Barry> yes
<Polarfire> probab;y.
<BlacklightShining> the kick I described?
<Polarfire> They won't sell toys if they go changing crap up.
<Barry> right
<Barry> Though they managed just fine with the gen 4 toys compared to gen 1
<Colgate> kick kick kick!
<Colgate> ban ban ban!
<stripes> you only have to look at the pound puppies , in the 1980's 2 seasons and yet such different looking characters
<Colgate> puch punch punch!
<Polarfire> Maybe new characters.... but changing what they've got going right now is a terrible marketing decision.
<mook> kick punch it's all in the mind
<BlacklightShining> wrong…how?
<Colgate> (ignore the drunkard please)
<Polarfire> And they won;t ignore money :P
<Barry> New characters in a new season, co9uld happen
<BlacklightShining> kz
*BlacklightShining is now ignoring Colgate
<Barry> They might even bring back the Sea Serpent and Manticore
<BlacklightShining> (not really…)
<AtomicBrony> Punch Kick Block BAN
<Flamerunner> Mustache.
<stripes> true, but any originals must look identical..
<Flamerunner> WHAT WORLD.
<Polarfire> stripes, the 80's was a.... down time for cartoons.
<stripes> hehe
<Drake> 04How are you?
<Barry> Maybe another episode with the Poison Joke
<Barry> but with different characters being affected
<Polarfire> its like comparing shit to rainbows :P
<stripes> i grew up on astro, starblazers and kimba..they were great times
<Barry> lol
<stripes> lol
<Colgate> I feel dumb right now
<Colgate> and I don't know how to unignore people
<Colgate> :(
<Barry> That ain't even a proper comparison
<Flamerunner> romana.
<Colgate> /ignore help didn't help
<Polarfire> back in the 80's anything went. 90's to pretty much now, there are standards.
<Polarfire> which you don't break, especially if the show is for a toy line.
<Barry> Not that big in the 90s. One look at Animaniacs will tell you that
<Glacymr> 12great job SilverSonic
<Glacymr> 12you made drf mad
<SilverSonic> Lol
<Jazza> What client?
<AtomicBrony> help ignore
<SilverSonic> i use that face periodicly ;p
<AtomicBrony> Or /help ignore
<Polarfire> well standards as far as success.
<Barry> Though that would explain The Legend of Zelda's failure
<stripes> well i hope your right Polarfire
<Barry> The Super Mario Brothers Super Show, however, was a success and went on to have two sequels
<Polarfire> I enjoyed the innuendo's of 90's cartoons, they make them just as fun to watch now as back then.
<stripes> yupers
<Barry> *smooch* Good night everybody
<Polarfire> night barry
<Barry> Not really going to bed
<GGgala_> same
<Polarfire> sleep good
<stripes> night night barry.sweet pony dreams!
<Polarfire> oh
<Barry> just a quote from Animaniacs
<Colgate> naw, I got it figured out
<Polarfire> OH
<GGgala_> oh lawl
*Flamerunner flies.
<Colgate> now I can see BigMacintosh|SortingPonyFolder's messages again
<Colgate> for better or for worse!
<Barry> Yakko would do that every time they managed to slip by the censors
<stripes> dito for the GGgala_ to
*Polarfire slaps himself around a bit with a large trout
<Flamerunner> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8sE5kWvlhU
<Polarfire> how did I miss that?
<Flamerunner> Random song :P
<Polarfire> well anyway
<stripes> hehe
<Polarfire> ok here's a good one.
*AtomicBrony is having fun watching esoterradubstep's dubstep face
<BigMacintosh|SortingPonyFolder> trolololol
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02Recovering, but good.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02You?
<Paintsplash> So...I'm thinking about going to Bronycon in NYC in September...
<AtomicBrony> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEcj2xi9Ctc
