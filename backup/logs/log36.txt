<Darkened_Path> jesus, i've been here since 2 arizona time, it's 9:30 now.

<Twentypercent> skyrim ftw
<Stormy> that's Applejack
<Stormy> :P
<SonicRainboom> 1st one was my favorite
<Frame_Rate_Pony> I really want a Blu Ray version ... it might happen, seeing how they have HD versions
<Outline> Dune 2k is abandonware now?
<Ivan2294> lol, MW3 PMVs
<AgnitioExMachina> I reccomend Dune 2k
<AgnitioExMachina> Yep
<Lambda> no, look in the related videos
<BronyJack> WANT!!!
<Leoshi> Mass Effect 3 for the win.
<Ivan2294> ^_^
<HaxBrony> gow 3 FTW
<SonicRainboom> 2nd one was awesome but went down a bit for me
<Stormy> or was that a "Just kidding, I posted Applejack"?
<AgnitioExMachina> It's abandonware
<Broonsbane> I hope mass effect 3 is better than da2
<BigBob> Mass Effect 3 is looking to be great.
<nah> 0i really hope they don't screw up ME3 like they did DA2
<Lambda> look what song Derpy's version has
<rubenflonne12> i love my PS3
<Ivan2294> Well, what about RPGs?
<SonicRainboom> da2 sucked
<Outline> Hmm. Might have to grab that.
<Frame_Rate_Pony> Also, yes Mass Effect 3 is going to be ... EPIC!
<SonicRainboom> imho
<Ivan2294> Good RPGs?
<AgnitioExMachina> The guys on Abandonia make absolutely sure
<Leoshi> you and me both, nah
<Stormy> oh, hahaha
<Misery> im hesistant to buy another bioware game after DA2
<AgnitioExMachina> That something's abandonware
<duMORI> they are adding MP to ME3 so says the rumor mill
<Misery> good thing i didnt buy da2 though
<AgnitioExMachina> before releasing it
<BronyJack> DA?
<duMORI> sooo yeah
<Twentypercent> never played dragon age 2, why did it suck
<Lambda> I like AJ's version
<duMORI> fuck you EA
<RainbowSmash> Frame_Rate_Pony They might need a bit more bonuses to fill a BD imo
<Misery> dragon age 2
<Broonsbane> isn't ME3 going to be the last one?
<Bunnylisk> I'm really looking forward to MA3
<SonicRainboom> Dragon Age
<Ivan2294> THEN EXPLAIN X-COM!!!!
<HaxBrony> well
<AgnitioExMachina> Trust me, they're strict about it
<Outline> Is Baldur's Get abandonware yet? Because get that if so.
<BronyJack> *facehoof
<Broonsbane> planned?
<Misery> EA really needs to go away
<BronyJack> derp
<rubenflonne12> ah dragon age did not grew on me
<Frame_Rate_Pony> Mass Effect, 360, PS3 or PC? What's your preference?
<Lambda> Cotton Eyed Joe is a guilty pleasure for me
<Bunnylisk> ME3**
<rubenflonne12> i got bored
<Lambda> :P
<AgnitioExMachina> Ivan, it says you can BUY it
<Stormy> haha
<SherlockHooves> Dragon Age
<Outline> (erm, Gate, not Get.
<duMORI> PC
<AgnitioExMachina> Not download for free
<CharlesAppleJackson> PC
<BigBob> PC
<Stormy> I kind of like it too
<AgnitioExMachina> Hold on
<Misery> bioware would have made da2 better if EA didnt give them such a short development time i think
<RainbowSmash> PC PC PC PC PEEE CEEEE
<Broonsbane> PC!
<SonicRainboom> Fighting was bad, storyline was nowhere near as epic
<Misery> pc
<Outline> Ahh damnit.
<nah> 0@misery let me fix that for you
<duMORI> I'm a PC gamer though and thopugh
<Ivan2294> I know
<rubenflonne12> PC for skins, PS3 for gameplay
<Ivan2294> lol
<Darkened_Path> allright guys, see ya next week.
<Dee_Twenty> That's false, Bioware confirmed in a magazine article there will be absolutely none of that multi-player shit in ME3.
<nah> 0"Activision really needs to go away"
<Leoshi> PC - and I only own a 360.
<Leoshi> haha
<Lambda> the only song I enjoyed dancing to back in PE
<Misery> yea
<Hunter> PC
<duMORI> ps DNF is shit on the 360
<Sol> I'm a console peasant
<Lambda> :P
<Stormy> They played it a lot at this camp I went to in 7th grade
<SonicRainboom> oh,and they used the same cave over and over
<Frame_Rate_Pony> Im PC, but I think I'm going to switch to 360 for the kinnect support
<Misery> activision needs to go away also
<Ivan2294> I got too many FPS games.
<DarkMemories> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/02/100-things-pinkie-pie-is-not-allowed-to.html
<duMORI> controlls are lame
<HaxBrony> gah
<DarkMemories> Found it.
<Ivan2294> Or indie games
<SonicRainboom> just blocked off some passages
<Stormy> so a lot of it's nostalgia I guess
<Bronypeanut> 13I love this song
<DarkMemories> Wrong channel
<Lambda> same here
<rubenflonne12> DNF is better on PS3
<DarkMemories> xD
<Frame_Rate_Pony> Shin Chan
<rubenflonne12> PC is okauy
<Ivan2294> So, I want some good Strategy and RPGs
<Lambda> brings me back to high school gym class
<DarkMemories> Sorry for the random link
<SherlockHooves> We should watch Equestrian Gurls
<duMORI> kennect SKD is out and allows PC suport
<Bunnylisk> Great.. now I need to go watch Shin Chan again
<HaxBrony> lol
<duMORI> so why 360
<SonicRainboom> Pinkazoid
<Twentypercent> can we get some epic rap battles of history up in here
<Ivan2294> Unique strategy
<RainbowSmash> Hmm, that gives me an idea of a poll, how many of us bronies are PC or PS3/360 gamers
<Ivan2294> Like X-Com or WiC
<HaxBrony> kinnet finally getting some good uses
<CharlesAppleJackson> there's a few new suggestions in the thread
<Misery> PC only here
<AgnitioExMachina> Outline, it's not on Abandonia
<Zebranky> GOG.com is a good place.
<Broonsbane> ya good one
<mib_xosqn3> i play pc
<BronyJack> yes
<SherlockHooves> pc
<rubenflonne12> depends on the game
<StarShine> 0ShinChan <3
<Twentypercent> i am
<Leoshi> 360 here
<AgnitioExMachina> I Googled it and some site has it
<mib_6033qz> Requesting Muffinproof.
<Twentypercent> all of them
<SherlockHooves> pc/360
<Mag> PC here
<AgnitioExMachina> But I don't trust it
<rubenflonne12> FPS has to be a PC thing
<Ivan2294> Those aren't your typical RTS or TBS
<HaxBrony> im PC/360. mainly 360
<Outline> Hrm. That's a shame
<Bunnylisk> PC here
<CircuitMane> @ RainbowSmash how about all of the above?
<Misery> seriously
<BronyJack> I disagree
<Darf14> PC, 360, .....and WII
<Misery> fps on consoles is flawed
<AgnitioExMachina> Oh, there is TeS
<rubenflonne12> anything else consel unless i like to mod it
<Broonsbane> i'm PC... with an unloved Wii
<Misery> analog sticks are terrible for accuracy
<Sol> PONY POLKA
<Misery> pony polka please
<AgnitioExMachina> The original Elder Scrolls and stuff but Bethesda actually released it
<RainbowSmash> aye, FPSs on consoles are just awkward for me too
<Broonsbane> yay pony polka
<Ivan2294> I have Civ V for all my Turn-based needs, and Typical RTS games bore me.
<BronyJack> Holy batshit, Weird Al likes this?
<AgnitioExMachina> on their site for free
<BronyJack> LOVE
<Broonsbane> yes
<mib_xosqn3> oh god i memorized this polka
<Misery> yes
<AgnitioExMachina> And a couple of sequels too
<mib_6033qz> YES!
<Misery> i love this one
<BigBob> yes
<Lambda> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPZjo7y2nnE&feature=related
<Dee_Twenty> Wii is the best for FPS. You can't get better controls for a shooter than the Wii.
<SonicRainboom> excellent chioce
<rubenflonne12> i grew up with Doom with uncles x3
<Zebranky> AgnitioExMachina: If the site is GOG.com, trust it.
<Broonsbane> i like the second one a little better
<Frame_Rate_Pony> I always had a problem with switching between guns and controlling my team without a keyboard
<AgnitioExMachina> It's not GOG
<Ivan2294> So that's why I want some good unique strategy games.
<Zebranky> They're quite legit.
<Lambda> Pinkie's version is to music from my ancestry's homeland
<Bunnylisk> Weird Al is now officially 20% cooler.
<SherlockHooves> so how long does the aftershow last?
<rubenflonne12> a whole house playing doom on computer x3
<mib_xosqn3> i have every single polka on a playslist, and it takes over a half an hour to finish
<Zebranky> Well then buy it there :P
<Lambda> oh, by Weird Ak
<Lambda> Al
<AgnitioExMachina> www.freeoldies.com
<Lambda> Awesome!
<Zebranky> Or something else
<Misery> i love the "float on" part
<AgnitioExMachina> I think it's a pirate site tbh
<Misery> wish it was longer
<mib_xosqn3> yeah
<BigBob> Doom and Doom 2 are still great
<RainbowSmash> I'd play an FPS for my Wii, but I never seem to find the time to go out and buy one...
<AgnitioExMachina> I'm not linking the game
<mib_xosqn3> i love doom 1 and 2
<nah> 0does the aftershow just go on the entire night
<AgnitioExMachina> I just don't trust the site
<Misery> wii doesnt even have that many first person shooters does it?
<BronyJack> I remember when parents shat themselves over DOOM
<Broonsbane> dude don't do FPS on the wii
<CircuitMane> @SherlockHooves until they get bored or enough bronies leave
<rubenflonne12> BFG
<Broonsbane> thats a bad idea
<mib_xosqn3> someone made doom for wii as a hack
<RainBroDash> Resident Evil 4 worked really well on wii
<duMORI> I need income uneployment sucks
<Darf14> I like the 2nd DOOM
<nah> 0bluh
<RainbowSmash> There were a couple of CoDs i think
<SherlockHooves> oh well ok then
<Ivan2294> Hey are any of the other X-Com games good?
<Misery> best part now
<Leoshi> I'm out. Later bronies.
<rubenflonne12> really hate RE4
<AgnitioExMachina> Anyways Ivan hold on
<Broonsbane> RE4 might work
<duMORI> though tbh im brithish I coudl just go on he dole for a bit
<Bunnylisk> Whenever I get a console I always end up forgetting about it and never playing the thing
<Sol> FEEL GOOD
<Silverscreen> 11Feel good, inc. Good song
<Dee_Twenty> And the Ghostbusters game was incredible on Wii.
<AgnitioExMachina> Idk

<BigBob> gotta love dat super shotgun
<RainbowSmash> and there were the RE railshooters
<StarShine> 0Resident Evil <3
<Misery> AND WE'LL ON FLOAT ON ALRIGHT
<AgnitioExMachina> Probably
<SherlockHooves> very good song
<Frame_Rate_Pony> What movies did you guys watch tonight?
<Zebranky> Yeah, no, GOG's the only site I know of that distributes it legit right now
<AgnitioExMachina> Wait hold on
<RainBroDash> StarShine <3
<Zebranky> I hear good things about all of the X-COMs
<Misery> aladdin and starship troopers

<duMORI> I dont mind a nice cold one now and then but I am a sprits guy
<rubenflonne12> i drink for flavor, brandy and whisky for me
<Dee_Twenty> I only drink for the sake of seeing what something new tastes like.
<RainBroDash> I drink beer when I feel like drinking, but I'm not -so- fond of it
<SirSprinkles> 6Whisky = win
<AgnitioExMachina> But you wanna know the best part?
<AgnitioExMachina> http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/96/UFO+2000.html
<BronyJack> more of a caffeine-free mountain dew man myself
<StarShine> 0Vodka!
<CircuitMane> I drink it once in a while, but never get drunk
<SonicRainboom> Beer is good, guinness is good, there is a microbrewery in colorado that makes one of my favorite beers though, called "Hazed and Infuzed"
<BigBob> Great vid
<AgnitioExMachina> It's X-Com multiplayer evidently
<Broonsbane> Root beer all the time for me
<Darf14> I only drink if its a special get together
<SherlockHooves> I don't drink so my opinions are useless in the coversation
<duMORI> whisky is awesome
<RainBroDash> I'm a hardcore Pepsi Max addict

<AgnitioExMachina> Mongoose hold on
<Misery> this for me
<RainBroDash> I've been so tempted by it
<RainbowSmash> Same here
<Lambda> brb
<Lambda> it's remi's bedtime
<duMORI> I want the pony shot glasses
<HaxBrony> i started to watch MLP cuz my cousins watched it while i was babysittin them
<mib_6bhus6> for me it was this and that moonbase alpha parody
<Broonsbane> i actually saw Bridle gossip first and that was enough to get me interested
<StarShine> 0If You Seek Amy.
<SherlockHooves> Night Frame Rate
<BigBob> I found out about it on KYM
<duMORI> I woudl love a MLP sake set but so not going to happen
<Twentypercent> i got it from watching moonbase alpha lol
<Dee_Twenty> I seem to be the only brony who was convinced by CR from That Guy With the Glasses.
<CircuitMane> A furry friend that likes to RP different stories with me (mind out of gutter) convinced me to get into ponies to do another big RP, and it stuck to me :)
<Ivan2294> Dude, I love you so much now.
<BigBob> In very early March
<Broonsbane> because i was subbed to masterlinkx when he started uploading MLP
<duMORI> unless I get out and make one
<Sol> lol Rainbow
<BronyJack> I remember the EXACT moment I joined the herd
<rubenflonne12> i got so annoyed because i thought it was some BS main stream stuff going on, so i popped the first episode on and i got hooked
<StarShine> 0Good ol RP bros
<Ivan2294> Dosbox + free games = win
<Darf14> Ive been thinking, what made you watch MLP, For me I saw it constantly over the net and I finally caved in and started to watch it and got hooked.
<Mongoose> hell yeah
<HaxBrony> first episode i saw was the pilot first part with my cousins. I can say i enjoyed it more them
<AgnitioExMachina> http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/195/Elder+Scrolls+-+Arena,+The.html
<rubenflonne12> SoCal brony here
<Dashite> I started watching because of the trolls.
<Lambda> back
<AgnitioExMachina> There's the first Elder Scrolls
<Broonsbane> MLP came to me really
<StarShine> 0Epsiode 5, Day before my birthday
<AgnitioExMachina> You need Dos-Box to play it though
<Broonsbane> and i was tired
*DarkMemories looks back and sees the topic is still free/share/abandonware games, leaves again
<Broonsbane> and a little loony
<StarShine> 0Decided to watch it on my Birthday
<AgnitioExMachina> Look it up and download it
<Broonsbane> so i watched it
<AgnitioExMachina> lol Dark
<HaxBrony> lol
<StarShine> 0Became a brony.
<Misery> before i saw ponycraft i was seeing alot of pony pictures on /v/ so i was curious
<duMORI> I saw a lot of the MLP trailers and the brony threads on the escapist and when humm looks intresting
<User_3392> rawre
<HaxBrony> good birthday i take it starshine?
<Bunnylisk> my little niece actually introduced me to the show. I was babysitting her and she wanted to watch ponies.
<Mongoose> ok
<StarShine> 0Best of my life.
<Broonsbane> that and swithcing between Heavy Rain and MLP is kinda fun in a sick way
<Sol> RIGHT ROUND
<AgnitioExMachina> http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/27432/Elder+Scrolls+-+Daggerfall%2C+The.html
<RainBroDash> I ignored it on 4chan's pokemon board, then forgot MLP was a thing for a while after i quit 4ch. then I re-discovered it, but i dont remember what exactly sparked my decision to try watching the first ep.
<AgnitioExMachina> And there's II
<StarShine> 0And I have some CRAZY birthdays.
<Dee_Twenty> CR did a Pinkie Pie in five seconds video, that was enough to convince me, he's got excellent taste in animation.
<AgnitioExMachina> I hear you can download them direct from Bethesda, though
<rubenflonne12> i would like to try to do a my little pony FiM D&D campaign at some point
<RainBroDash> by 'ignored it', i mean ignored ponies
<BronyJack> I watched the first two eps after I got home from work
<ahmhappehplz> I felt bad for making fun of MLP after I found out I loved it
<Mongoose> thats awesome
<Tyranico> My Little Seinfeld plox
<mib_xosqn3> alrighty then
<Broonsbane> i'd love to do a FiM DnD campaign sometime
<StarShine> 0Yes pleas
<mib_xosqn3> im up for nother few hours
<BronyJack> jumped into my truck and went to McDonalds at 2 am to buy toys
<StarShine> 0My Little Seinfeld
<AgnitioExMachina> But you need Dos-Box to play them, though
<HaxBrony> dam.
<mib_xosqn3> i gots the caffine
<AgnitioExMachina> once again
<duMORI> one of my exs ribs me for being openly brony
<RainBroDash> lol BronyJack
<Bunnylisk> that would be awesome, Broonsbane.
<RainBroDash> xD
<HaxBrony> i still think RD is tomboy. not lez
<Mongoose> Exclamation Point
<duMORI> she don't know whatg she's missing
<SonicRainboom> ^^agreed
<Misery> im glad i didnt brush it off as a cartoon for little girls
<Stormy> I'm packing now
<rubenflonne12> i think she is Tomboy too
<Mongoose> ok
<Sol> Yep, my friend nuke showed me WWU, and I thought it was bad because of of Rarities first lines about boots. I cam to like it eventually
<StarShine> 0Broonsbane, I would do anything to get in on that.
<RainbowSmash> RD is more borderline for me
<Rust> i need more ponies
<Stormy> So sorry if I'm slow to answer
<SupaScootaloo> lawl
<CircuitMane> I still got the drawing challenge to do, and probably should clean up around my area
<Rust> ponies ponies ponies
<RainbowSmash> possibly lesbo but is in denial
<duMORI> RD is bi as every one cool is BI ( at least in my experirences XD)
<Broonsbane> well i'm no DM though
<mib_6bhus6> i used to know someone like RD, she was totally lesbian
<AgnitioExMachina> Hey, talk about ponies and I'll probably talk about them too
<Nightmare_Moon> pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony pony
<StarShine> 0Yeah, neither am I
<RainBroDash> I've read too much fanfic to ever think rbd is anything but a lesbian >.<
<Bunnylisk> I'm more convinced Twilight is a fillyfooler than Rainbow is
<SherlockHooves> what challenge CircutMane?
<rubenflonne12> hehe well, while we are up, how about a good horror movie
<Rust> YES
<Rust> PONY
<AgnitioExMachina> Otherwise, still more abandonware
<Broonsbane> i'd be one of the ones that follows the rules
<RainbowSmash> duMORI mm.. I can live with that!
<BronyJack> awkward when your parents find you coming back at three with eight happy meal toys
<SupaScootaloo> MORE PONIES
<mib_xosqn3> yes!
<Broonsbane> and kills everyone
<Lambda> oh it's okay
<HaxBrony> didnt some finland brony change his name to RD?
<Sol> WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWw
<Silverscreen> 11:D
<mib_xosqn3> awsoem
<BronyJack> the girl toys
<SupaScootaloo> THERE IS PLACE
<AgnitioExMachina> Also I don't want you guys getting sick of ponies
<Broonsbane> yes
<RainbowSmash> EQGirls!
<Lambda> I understand
<RainBroDash> yeah the guys name is Rainbow Aleksi Dash or something now xD
<Nightmare_Moon> What is the definition of Abandonware, exactly?
<ahmhappehplz> AND BRONIES
<Tyranico> yay
<HaxBrony> woot
<HaxBrony> bronies
<Lambda> so you'll be leaving pretty early tomorrow?
<SupaScootaloo> HEY THERE
<Rust> They own my soul
<rubenflonne12> DJ-pon 3 x3
<Bunnylisk> No one can groove like the girls with the hooves!
<SherlockHooves> yeah that one mad me laught
<Rust> I don't think I can get sick of them
<SherlockHooves> ...
<DarkMemories> I think it's software that the rights to have been given up.
<mib_xosqn3> i really like how they are reacting to the fanbase
<Mongoose> http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/184/Grand+Theft+Auto.html\
<SherlockHooves> BRONIES
<mib_xosqn3> it makes me happy
<DarkMemories> Something along those lines.
<Stormy> yeah
<Stormy> 6:30
<Mongoose> Just gonna leave that there
<RainBroDash> ^ me too! :D
<SupaScootaloo> yeah only show eavr that cares about the fans
<AgnitioExMachina> Yep Dark
<Sol> Rainbooms are epic
<rubenflonne12> its rare to see a show that listens to the fans
<Irene> cant wait for s1 dvd's
<mib_xosqn3> i dont know any other show that does that
<duMORI> Yeah tbh I think me being a brony would only be one thing I'm hiding from my 'rents
<HaxBrony> and DJ Pon-3
<Twentypercent> pony fabulous
<mib_xosqn3> let alone a girl's show
<AgnitioExMachina> Basically they're not being sold anymore
<duMORI> I just need to move the fuck out
<RainbowSmash> is it fuzzy or furry coats? I never got that
<Darf14> It wasn't until the 3rd episode is when I got hooked, I was immediately hooked when Pinkie Pie was describing about the gala during her imagination.
<Lambda> D:
<AgnitioExMachina> and are public domain now
<SherlockHooves> this song came on the radio the otherday at work and I had to fight the urge to sing this version
<rubenflonne12> i know a few shows that did it
<BigBob> I got hooked first episode
<B-Man> Ponies!
<B-Man> Ponies are evil creatures.
<BronyJack> used my laptop to show vid in airframe class
<Lambda> do you have something to do for the car ride?
<B-Man> Ponies are awesome.
<B-Man> I must agree.
<Sol> Bronies are easily the best received and most widespread fandoms I've seen
<B-Man> So you like evil things?
<Metal_Link> Why did she say Bronies?
<mib_xosqn3> is dj pon-3 suposed to be vynl scratch?
<StarShine> 0YEEEEEEEEEEES
<B-Man> Yes, like ghosts.
<Sol> Make me happy
<Tyranico> ...and sasparilla
<B-Man> Conversation With Cleverbot.
<StarShine> 0OH GOD YEEEEES/
<Bunnylisk> Its probably the best rated show on the Hub or at least in the top 3
<duMORI> OMG AWESOME
<SherlockHooves> yes
<AgnitioExMachina> Cool story
<StarShine> 0This Video, more than anythign
<Dee_Twenty> Dude, don't fight it, dance through your workplace singing it! :p
<BronyJack> >had ponies in playlist
<HaxBrony> prince glueblood
<RainBroDash> I've hatched a master plan to get one of my bros to watch an episode with me: gonna offer him beer and fried chicken at mine, paid for by me, as long as we watch MLP
<RainbowSmash> DJ-PON3 is the stagename i believe
<BronyJack> >pokerface.jpg
<Stormy> ...no
<Stormy> :(
<Lambda> :(
<Rust> wheeee
<Outline> Cleverbot. Not exactly the most reliable conversation partner.
<HaxBrony> dude
*Rust falls asleep
<mib_xosqn3> ah, thanks raindbowsmash
<AgnitioExMachina> nope
<SonicRainboom> suddenly, loud
<AgnitioExMachina> Ever since /b/ screwed it over
<Misery> yea
<Lambda> you could always draw
<StarShine> 0Nothin; suits me like a suit
<duMORI> I told one of my close mates then I found it awesome when I frist turned brony and now she's hooked
<AgnitioExMachina> It needs a huge reset
<Lambda> or play pokemon
<Outline> What did /b/ do to it?
<SherlockHooves> I think the guys in the receiving bay tossing heavy boxes would hit me if I started singing EQ girls
<RainbowSmash> Zoot Suit?
<AgnitioExMachina> They basically forced meme responses
<StarShine> 0Dang, that episode when he got the suit encrested with Diamonds
<Dee_Twenty> I finally converted my sister, she agreed to watch the first season if I agreed to watch Supernatural.
<Sol> I'm surprised there's no My Strongest Suit from Aida
<AgnitioExMachina> It was the beginning of the cancer era
<AgnitioExMachina> a few years back
<Lambda> you can also always text me
<Nightmare_Moon> cleverbot knows about the weeping angels, I laughed.
<RainBroDash> my bros would just dwell on it way too much if i told them
<duMORI> HIMYM is awesome brb finding torrent
<AgnitioExMachina> Ironically they also made it popular on the net
<HaxBrony> lol.
<Lambda> just if I'm not awake yet I won't answer until I am
<BigBob> Wow I just realized where this song is from.
<Mongoose> The Weeping angels are dicks.
<SupaScootaloo> lALW
<Lambda> :P
<RainbowSmash> Same here RainBro
<SupaScootaloo> where is it form?
<BronyJack> where is it from?
<RainbowSmash> except they would be sisters

<mib_xosqn3> lol
<BigBob> A show called "How I Met Your Mother"
<SupaScootaloo> oh
<mib_xosqn3> im not sure how to tell my serious friend that im a brony...
<BronyJack> I thought so!
<Outline> Hmm.
<StarShine> 0How I met yo motha!
<mib_6bhus6> I told my best brofriend about it once, i think he's a brony but he won't admit it lol
<SonicRainboom> this vid is pretty awesome never saw this one
<Stormy> I also don't have unlimited texting
<RainBroDash> they'd just make it out as being something it isn't, and probably shout at me for 'going back to the internet' (I'm a recovering WoW player and 4chan addict xD)
<Mongoose> Dicks are PG
<Lambda> Yeah, I know
<Broonsbane> nonsense
<mib_xosqn3> exactly
<SherlockHooves> I got my Brother into just by saying: Jason, youtube My little Pony right now!
<duMORI> XD
<Broonsbane> ponies are on TV
<rubenflonne12> i converted 2 people into the fandom x3
<Stormy> 500 per month and after that it's $0.20 per text sent and recieved
<AgnitioExMachina> I was there the day /b/ officially turned catanically cancerous
<SherlockHooves> and he did and the rest was history
<Irene> Hah no-one can quit WoW
<Irene> you will be back
<AgnitioExMachina> Or rather the days
<Bunnylisk> Mine torture me by sending me the most horribly written clopfic they can find. I think they enjoy my rage.
<Twentypercent> true
<duMORI> I got on 4chan when it was "new" and I was way too young for it XD
<StarShine> Still gotta say
<Lambda> but if you want to text me just a little bit
<Broonsbane> i haven't played WoW for a while...
<AgnitioExMachina> I still call /b/ cancer
<StarShine> Rainbow Dash's armor
<StarShine> BADASS.
<RainBroDash> Nah, it's been more than a year now, I've got hardcore willpower
<Broonsbane> but then again i've been busy with other games
<HaxBrony> ftw
<mib_xosqn3> i need to draw my brony, and then get an identiy, then i gotta start converting
<Broonsbane> like i want to play it
<Lambda> I promise I won't text you too much so that you go over the limit
<RainBroDash> WoW is shit now anyway
<RainbowSmash> RD armor is awesome
<Irene> 4.2 looks promising
<BronyJack> got a bud who will watch if I watch his cartoon
<SonicRainboom> I stopped playing wow like 3 years ago, best decision of my life
<Misery> yea it is
<AgnitioExMachina> Also one of the reasons I no longer use Chans
<Tyranico> YTP?
<Broonsbane> but i'd rather ladder SC2 or play TF2
<duMORI> never liked wow IDKY
<rubenflonne12> i got bored when it was vanilla WoW
<Misery> lol
<Stormy> ok
<Ivan2294> So ya'll are finally talking about ponies now?
<AgnitioExMachina> The crap I had worked for got taken away by a bunch of little sh**s
<Dee_Twenty> RainBroDash >Implying WoW wasn't ALWAYS shit.
<Outline> Must admit, I've never really had much of an opinion of /b/. It's just a place on the internet to avoid, that occasionally attacks othe places. That's all.
<rubenflonne12> i did not think it was worth my money after i hit 65
<Broonsbane> and i've been playing more or less since late vanilla
<duMORI> Giuld Wars gets me hooks for a month or two each year though
<rubenflonne12> or 60**
<HaxBrony> lol
<mib_xosqn3> should I try making My little pony skins for tf2 or something?
<RainBroDash> I liked WotLK pre-Ulduar :/
<RainBroDash> don't hate
<mib_xosqn3> i just thougth of that
<StarShine> Vanilla WoW was great
<HaxBrony> LOL
<Darf14> LOL
<StarShine> All other WoW is shit
<StarShine> :3
<Stormy> I'll probably just start over one of my GBA games
<RainBroDash> by pre-Ulduar I mean pre-ToTC
<rubenflonne12> im waiting for guide wars 2
<Lambda> ah
<Stormy> which means I'll have to find a GBA
<SherlockHooves> lol
<Stormy> crap
<Mongoose> yeah
<Bunnylisk> I played WoW for so long.. it felt so weird to cancel my subscription.
<RainbowSmash> I need good MLP sprays
<RainBroDash> Ulduar was fxcking SEXY
<Irene> TotC was horrible
<Lambda> that hm?
<mib_6bhus6> cata heroics were kinda fun until warrior tanks were nerfed hardcore
<mib_xosqn3> back in black
<rubenflonne12> guild**
<Lambda> *hm
<AgnitioExMachina> ./b/ is where a bunch of "good" memes came from in the past
<StarShine> Macho Man!
<Stormy> I have two
<HaxBrony> dam i dont like ACDC
<AgnitioExMachina> Before a bunch of schoolchildren found it
<SupaScootaloo> cata suck
<Stormy> but I don't know where either are
<mib_xosqn3> i love acdc =D
<Lambda> D:
<Irene> Ulduar was awesome
<RainBroDash> warr tanks ftw ;)
<SherlockHooves> Google it RainBroDash
<BronyJack> MACHO SPIKE!
<AgnitioExMachina> Although I think Dio Brando was more /v/
<mib_xosqn3> i wetn to a concert
<SupaScootaloo> all about WOTLK
<duMORI> what you don't like ACDC
<Broonsbane> cata is better than wrath
<BronyJack> DIO FTW!
<Darf14> Nacho Man!
<SherlockHooves> ...
<Broonsbane> wrath was boring
<SupaScootaloo> NO its no
<Outline> Ehh. Everything seems to be better before the masses are introduced to it.
<StarShine> Blinded by the liiight
<mib_xosqn3> and...the guy next to me was smoking pot, a bit ackward....but oh well
<HaxBrony> run
<DarkMemories> But now it's just a moshpit of filth and idiocy with the occasional bright spark that gets dulled down by a bunch more idiocy and filth.
<SupaScootaloo> wrath was awsome
<DarkMemories> xP
<AgnitioExMachina> Outline, yep, that'
<SupaScootaloo> is all like pew pew
<Gordon_Freeman> /b/ is just an imageboard that got discovered by kids trying to look cool.
<DarkMemories> That's what I see it as.
<Dee_Twenty> I'm against any game that expects me to pay a monthly fee for the continued privilege to play a game I ALREADY paid for.
<BronyJack> F*** yeah!
<AgnitioExMachina> is the way of the hipster
<mib_xosqn3> like every game?
<HaxBrony> lol
<HaxBrony> dam
<mib_xosqn3> fuck...rick rolled
<HaxBrony> rick rollin DJ PON-3
<DarkMemories> @Outline: That's a very hipster view on things. xP
<Silverscreen> 11RICKROLLED!
<RainbowSmash> DJRoll?
<mib_2gudet> lol
<Lambda> an your DS can't play GBA games
<DarkMemories> But oh so true
<AgnitioExMachina> Gordon, basically, and they ruined it to Dark's description
<SherlockHooves> ...yes
<Lambda> *and
<HaxBrony> dear god spike
<SherlockHooves> yes to this
<mib_xosqn3> i feel sad after that XD
<Outline> Hey, Hipsters were cool before being one was popular...
<Silverscreen> 11XD
<Mongoose> So So true
<SherlockHooves> lol
<SonicRainboom> fuuuuuu
<Gordon_Freeman> They hear it's "omg SO HARDCORE" and then it became hipster central.
<HaxBrony> hamma time
<AgnitioExMachina> I've always been a fucking Hipster
<Tyranico> lool
<Broonsbane> now to be fair you do get content expansions every once and awhile for "free" from WoW
<DarkMemories> Now it's a paradox
<Twentypercent> NOTHING AT ALL
<HaxBrony> stupid flander
<HaxBrony> s
<AgnitioExMachina> Like those Goth kids
<mib_xosqn3> lol nothing at all
<rubenflonne12> refreash
<Darf14> stupid sexy Rarity
<Silverscreen> 11Stupid Sexy Rarity
<Fanloser> Sonnava!
<AgnitioExMachina> from South Park
<mib_6bhus6> this is great
<SherlockHooves> just 2 more hours before I can go to sleep
<RainBroDash> I just dislike how casuals in that game believe that they are entitled to 'see all the content' when they're just not good enough. so nerfs happen all the time, everywhere
<Stormy> yeah
<Outline> Mmmhmm.
<Stormy> I miss my old DS
<DarkMemories> You're a hipster if you aren't a hipster, because being a hipster is too mainstream.
<AgnitioExMachina> Hey, can't be hipster 100% of the time
<Stormy> I wish it didn't die
<Stormy> :(
<BlankFlankBrony> XD
<rubenflonne12> we should watch some flying circus stuff :3
<Lambda> I'm really sorry about that
<SupaScootaloo> LAWL
<RainBroDash> it ruins the game for skilled players :L
<Broonsbane> i'm kinda casual but i like it hard
<Gordon_Freeman> Mostly browse /tg/ nowadays.
<Irene> Well look at the upcoming nerfs...
<BronyJack> KHAAAAN!
<Dee_Twenty> I'd rather pay for the free expansions than a monthly fee.
<Broonsbane> and the nerfs made me said
<HaxBrony> KAAAAHHHN!
<DarkMemories> It's a paradox
<mib_xosqn3> KHAAAAAAN
<AgnitioExMachina> Dark, I've said that before but that isn't very hipster to disregard definition
<Silverscreen> 11XD
<AgnitioExMachina> lol
<Broonsbane> said? i mean sad
<RainBroDash> XDD

<RainbowSmash> If I saw Flutterguy first, I would have really known I was a brony
<mib_xosqn3> i like this sonic the hedgehog song, regardless of the fact thats its a bit overused
<rubenflonne12> sonic got bad after the dreamcast one
<AgnitioExMachina> Dark, read the crap I typed
<Darf14> Ahh, the Dreamcast days, its a shame the console didn't survive.
<DarkMemories> Oh right, the Trolololo song.
<CharlesAppleJackson> LIVE AND LEARN / HANGING ON THE EDGE OF TOMORROW
<CircuitMane> I loved the sonic parts of the game
<WindKnight114> Just listening to this makes me want to play SA2

<SherlockHooves> just two more hours
<RainbowSmash> screw sleep
<Twentypercent> derp
<DarkMemories> We need more links, as if anypony hasn't heard it yet. xP
<DarkMemories> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6FUR_nhGX8
<rubenflonne12> i hate the 3D ones in personal opinion
<rubenflonne12> it killed it
<RainbowSmash> ponies are more important than sleep
<AgnitioExMachina> ;o
<Ali1017> welcome to the void
<RainBroDash> which one of you stole my guitar pick, I am livid
<SupaScootaloo2> when i was a kid i awlways thought he said save ur beans and bacon
<duMORI> I have to at a con in 4 hours
<DarkMemories> I actually like the song, despite being gibberish
<Ali1017> *burrows*
<mib_xosqn3> i like adventure, but other than that's it's the sega genesis for me
<SupaScootaloo2> i was a dumb kid
<Dee_Twenty> It's the fans that annoy me more than the newer games.
<duMORI> so screw sleep
<DarkMemories> Like that one swedish one
<AgnitioExMachina> Holy shit, that went on the Colbert Show?
<Silverscreen> 11RubenFionne12: Sonic Adventure was 3D, and it was the best game of the series, IMO
<DarkMemories> like, Loituma something.
<AgnitioExMachina> Ivean Polkka?
<RainbowSmash> your wellbeing is less than ponies
<DarkMemories> Something.
<RainBroDash> Sonic Adventure 2 was ok :o
<AgnitioExMachina> It's Ivean Polkka
<DarkMemories> xD
<rubenflonne12> i thought sonic and knuckles was x3
<DarkMemories> Sure.
<muffin_hooves> Which con?
<Dee_Twenty> Especially the ones who insist on calling him Soniku or whatever.
<mib_xosqn3> man we really like to argue about videogames don't we?
<HaxBrony> is it odd that i have dead space 2 paused to watch this?
<Ghosties> 4Silverscreen: Uhhhhhh
<rubenflonne12> i only looked at the SA2 was okay
<Ghosties> 4No
<User_1597> hey
<RainBroDash> I loved the Chao garden rehash in Sonic Adventure 2, it was sexy. but I was a child
<Darf14> I like the two sonic adventure games, the rest of the 3D ones...not so much.
<mib_xosqn3> HaxBrony, no not at all
<Ghosties> 4Sonic 2 was the best in the series
<duMORI> well its less a con than a writers thingy but still
<DarkMemories> Hello thar.
<duMORI> its a small UK one
<CircuitMane> I'm sure we can all agree that it was Sonic Hero's and beyond where it all went to pot
<Outline> Greetings 1597
<mib_xosqn3> yeah sonic 2 was the first one i beat
<guestpony> hello night ponymanguy
<AgnitioExMachina> Dark, dude, you should listen to the non-censored one
<mib_xosqn3> of course
<WindKnight114> I <3 Sonic Colors and Sonic Adventure (1&2)
<AgnitioExMachina> It's trololo because the Soviets didn't like his lyrics
<mib_xosqn3> i havent played colors
<CharlesAppleJackson> me neither
<AgnitioExMachina> So he basically mocked the government
<Dee_Twenty> Fuck's sake he's not even a Japanese character, SEGA is an AMERICAN company, it's short for Service Games, they got their start making pinball machines and other games for the troops.
<duMORI> last year it got one of my 100 word stoies published
<DarkMemories> Yeah xD
<WindKnight114> Colors is epic
<CircuitMane> Color's is a glad exception
<rubenflonne12> i need to try sonic colors, i been hearing good things about it from people who agree with me on old sonic games
<AgnitioExMachina> And that's the trololo song today
<User_5752> wat
<Darf14> Sonic & Knuckles was the first Sonic game I beat
<User_7311> WAT
<AgnitioExMachina> Heard it from my classmate's presentation
<rubenflonne12> sonic 4 though disappointed me, it was a copy paste
<RainBroDash> bloody Sonic Heroes. honestly that game was so poor I cried
<DarkMemories> Is there a link to te uncenored one? assuming it's safe... Thoguh I guess it's Russian, so it doesn't matter much.
<mib_xosqn3> hey fun fact: did you know atari is responsible for chuck e. cheeses?
<Broonsbane> so... this just in
<AgnitioExMachina> It's so funny though that I heard about it again months after I originally posted it
<Ghosties> 4Sonic Generations though, that game looks AMAZING
<Silverscreen> 11RainBroDash: SA2 was horrible compared to its predecessor. The level structure was weak and linear rather than the freeroam of the first, the graphics actually looked WORSE, not to mention the story was all over the place. I didn't even manage to finish it because I couldn't handle playing it.
<AgnitioExMachina> It's safe
<User_5752> first time in this chat, I didn't know you have one
<SupaScootaloo2> sonic heros was compelty shit
<Broonsbane> but theres a pony synchtube marathon going on now
<AgnitioExMachina> It's about a cowboy going home
<WindKnight114> I already got Generations pre-ordered
<User_5752> equestria daily rocks
<Broonsbane> just started
<guestpony> oh, anyone wanna see a twilight sparkle figure?
<muffin_hooves> Good job duMORI.
<rubenflonne12> hated heros
<duMORI> SA was the BEST 3d sonic EVER
<AgnitioExMachina> The Russians hated it because it was American or something
<Ali1017> it's been there for a while
<Silverscreen> 11But that's my opinoion.
<User_5752> sure
<guestpony> http://ninjawarior.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d3j194p
<SherlockHooves> marathon whut?
<Pat> Sonic Generations looks awesome.
<AgnitioExMachina> I forget the song name, though
<RainBroDash> No no fair point silver
<Outline> Heh, it's true 5752 :)
<AgnitioExMachina> so Can't help you there
<Silverscreen> 11Pat: Hell yes.
<duMORI> thanks muffin_hooves
<Pinkamina> I'll respectfully disagree with that, Silbverswcreen
<Silverscreen> 11Generations looks badass
<Silverscreen> 11And I hear Color isn't too bad.
<Ghosties> 4I liked both Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2
<Pinkamina> about SA2. I like SA and SA2 equaky
<Ghosties> 4Sonic Colors was actually pretty damn fun
<User_5752> nice xD
<mib_xosqn3> oh god guitar awsomeness
<mib_xosqn3> jawfldukjhesf
<Pat> Colours is a fantastic game.
<mib_xosqn3> me has a small spaz attack
<SupaScootaloo2> but rairty white?
<Broonsbane> well i gotta go

<CharlesAppleJackson> brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb
<Darf14> X_X
<duMORI> Madness Returns any good
<Ghosties> 4HAHA, Alice Madness Returns got a 6.6
<rubenflonne12> i ignore all reviers
<Ghosties> 4God
<CircuitMane> crap, rainbowdash is stuck
<WindKnight114> ebrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
<rubenflonne12> i play the game bad or not, then i have the right to say it sucks or not
<guestpony> the show would not be the same without ANY of the mane six
<duMORI> I recently played the orginals 2001 alcie
<Sol> Here comes andother Chinese Earthquake
<AgnitioExMachina> Twilight Sparkle's the most important character
<random_forest_dude_behind_a_ca> what?is pinkie not going to be in seaseon 2??
<DarkMemories> Pinkie's second, don't worry.
<mib_6bhus6> yay more singalong
<Outline> Guestpony has it in one there.
<Pinkamina> uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu 890 uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu999999eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<Irene> this is scary >.>
<AgnitioExMachina> After all, she's like the LEADER of the PROTAGONISTS
<SupaScootaloo2> hercules really
<mib_xosqn3> well that shortened my lifespan.
<SupaScootaloo2> lawl
<guestpony> what i have?
<Pinkamina> ?~!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?! ebrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb
<Silverscreen> 11Yeah, they dropped the score for Madness Returns BECAUSE OF THE MAP BORDERS!
<HaxBrony> derp
<Pinkamina> aeiou
<RainBroDash> time to perform a rendition of Open Your Heart, at 6am with both sets of neighbours asleep #ComeAtMeBro
<BigBob> Alright I gtg now. Thanks for the awesome and hilarious time fellow bronies. See you guys around.
<DarkMemories> Well, not really.
<Ali1017> a PONY?
<AgnitioExMachina> I like over-emphasising
<WindKnight114> Moonbase Alpha is the best game ive played on Steam XD
<DarkMemories> she's just portrayed because she's so damn magical
<Outline> It's the only show I've seen where you could put up a viable arguement for ANY of the characters as the "best" one.
<mib_xosqn3> why is this being played =(
<RainbowSmash> gnite bob
<duMORI> MAP BORDERS OMFG
<Silverscreen> 11How fucking stupid is that?
<mib_xosqn3> windknight...not cool
<DarkMemories> Yeah xD
<guestpony> duh
<mib_xosqn3> gmod
<AgnitioExMachina> Dark, then can you imagine the show without her?
<Ali1017> true
<User_5752> You know, I like all the six except for Applejack, I mean, is cool, talks funny but I think she DESERVES more character development
<mib_xosqn3> it's on steam
<HaxBrony> what did duke nukem get
<Ghosties> 4I wouldn't be surprised if they dropped the score because lack of Multiplayer too. Oh, don't forget that THERE'S PLATFORMING IN IT
<duMORI> did they own FO3 and NV for them
<AgnitioExMachina> Without her discovering Nightmare Moon?
<guestpony> they even all have specific elements they contribute
<Ghosties> 4And it's a fucking platformer
<Ali1017> need moar dash
<User_5752> I mean, her cutie mark story was the weakeast by far
<AgnitioExMachina> And then basically befriending the mane cast?
<guestpony> quite literally
<DarkMemories> But the personalities are so different, they can't be compared viably.
<WindKnight114> nah it was actually Portal
<CharlesAppleJackson> Silverscreen I think we all know IGN is lame. It's a simple fact of liffe.
<rubenflonne12> everything has to have multiplier >.>
<duMORI> OMG a remake of a 3rd person action platphormer has platforming
<AgnitioExMachina> Without her, there'd be no MOTHERFUCKING CELESTIA
<CircuitMane> @Ghosties yeah I'll just wait for Angry Joe
<DarkMemories> Opinion and preference weigh too heavily.
<duMORI> SHIT1
<guestpony> exactly, i think
<AgnitioExMachina> NIGHTMARE MOON FOREVER
<Silverscreen> 11No, they did complain about "a repetetive fighting system"
<RainbowSmash> Meh, when was the last time IGN rated a game successfully?
<guestpony> fo'neva?
<Nightmare_Moon> Somepony said my name! Why have I been summoned?
<DarkMemories> celestia could have handled it
<Outline> You say that like it's a bad thing Agnito :P
<duMORI> never
<AgnitioExMachina> Your fault.
<Ghosties> 4I remember hearing that, but otherwise there was actually no mention of gameplay otherwise
<mib_xosqn3> lol
<rubenflonne12> exactly
<RainbowSmash> exactly
<duMORI> IGN is just there spouting shite
<guestpony> nightmare moon is lame pony
<DarkMemories> She jsut wanted Twilight to do it 'cuz she's a lazy troll.
<User_5752> OH SHI-
<AgnitioExMachina> I like Luna but Nightmare Moon is a cunt
<User_5752> LUNA...
<Nightmare_Moon> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25356
<SherlockHooves> oh like Fox news?
<guestpony> a bit harsh
<WindKnight114> I hate IGN cause for one reason, they dont give a shit for sonic. Seriously a 4.4/10 for Sonic Adventure 1?!
<Silverscreen> 11Honestly, I think IGN just hates on anything that doesn't have CALL OF DUTY on the cover.
<AgnitioExMachina> POOR STEVEN MAGNET
<Ali1017> Agn keep that in EquestriaAfterDark
<Gordon_Freeman> But WHO ARE THEIR PARENTS
<mib_xosqn3> true
<Nightmare_Moon> Luna is a train of severe emotional instability
<HaxBrony> lol
<AgnitioExMachina> I WILL NEVER FORGIVE WHAT NIGHTMARE MOON DID TO YOU!
<User_5752> still a mystery why she haven't appered at all in season one, after the second episode
<CircuitMane> Nah, IGN hates anything that doesn't pay them
<Ghosties> 4In fact, was lack of multiplayer and repetitive combat really a reason for giving it a 6.6?
<duMORI> lol
<SirSprinkles> 6This is truth.
<guestpony> you know the worst thing about nightmare moon
<SherlockHooves> Call of Duty Alice
<RainbowSmash> I have an itching feeling that IGN is a covert branch of Fox News
<CharlesAppleJackson> Silverscreen, that's the truth.
<Ghosties> 4Call of Alice
<AgnitioExMachina> User, she's locked in a towe
<duMORI> sorry but I dont get this MP love
<Lambda> http://imgur.com/QyBsB
<guestpony> not a question, by the way
<AgnitioExMachina> Actually Season 2 will probably answer that
<mib_xosqn3> mp makes the game extended for a few years
<Dee_Twenty> Multi-player sucks.
<SirSprinkles> 6...and then video died. ;-;
<Mongoose> brb
<DJMidli> So i hate toys'r'us in canada.
<AgnitioExMachina> They better have a valid excuse
<HaxBrony> lol Call of alice, madness warfare
<DJMidli> no frigging pony plushies ;-;
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties: considering that Multiplayer wasn't promised and that the fighting system is as repetative as ANY OTHER GAME LIKE IT, I'd say no.
<DJMidli> I want a twilight plush
<AgnitioExMachina> Buy dem
<duMORI> it 80% of games its shity xp based grindfests with NO SKILL BAR GETTING A DROP ON SOEM ONE
<guestpony> oh
<AgnitioExMachina> brb wata
<RainbowSmash> LLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG
<guestpony> they might have that show on DVD
<HaxBrony> cod fighting system is still virtual whack-a-mole
<Outline> Season 2... goddamnit why does oct/dec have to be so far away.
<duMORI> and screw up caps lock I didn't touch you
<guestpony> that would be awesome
<Dee_Twenty> Bollocks. You know what really extends a game for years? Being a good fucking game.
<Outline> I demand instant gratification!
<DJMidli> Outline theres a release date now?
<SupaScootaloo2> ^
<WindKnight114> Silverscreen Thats actually not true cause they want to not like a game thats why they're called Internet Gaming News and not Internet Gaming Reviews
<SupaScootaloo2> lawl
<Ali1017> hopes=dashed
<RainbowSmash> Like SC?
<Ghosties> 4Makes no sense. One of the best things about Alice Madness Returns is that you get a free copy of the original Alice game if you buy it new
<SherlockHooves> I'm still waiting, chomping at the bit in fact, for Guild Wars 2
<SupaScootaloo2> like warcraft 3
<duMORI> Dee_Twenty well said
<DarkMemories> It's fall winter.
<Outline> Nope. No release date. Just working off guesse.
<HaxBrony> lol buffering
<Outline> s
<CharlesAppleJackson> which game is this from again?
<Ossala> they better make celestia white or i'm causing someone's ass to catch the pink disease
<RainbowSmash> that's the longest played game I can remember
<Ghosties> 4And since I've never played the original Alice, needless to say, I'm pretty excited
<mib_xosqn3> sounds like sonic
<DarkMemories> On the toys?
<duMORI> Ghosties but I still have mine on disk :)
<WindKnight114> It is
<guestpony> what?
<CircuitMane> Personally I can understand if the game needs or can make good use of multiplayer but there are some games that will not work as well with it. I'd hate to see an RPG with a forced Multiplayer in it
<guestpony> hey
<LogicalFailure> We should paint the Hasbro HQ pink.
<duMORI> the orginal is fun btw
<guestpony> who is the best person here?
<Ossala> they made celestia pink,
<WindKnight114> Sonic Heroes Final Boss theme
<mib_xosqn3> well oblivion could use multiplayer
<duMORI> CircuitMane like say ME3
<mib_xosqn3> at least just a 4 player coop
<DarkMemories> Is the Hasbro HQ white?
<Pinkamina> Love this song
<Silverscreen> 11CircuitMane: Actually, I could easily see an RPG with multiplayer.
<mib_xosqn3> oblivion
<Ali1017> not anymore
<AgnitioExMachina> That's because the Hasbro toymakers are fuckin' dumb
<Ali1017> it'll be pink
<mib_xosqn3> 4 player coop or dm
<SherlockHooves> NO, just no anon, no multiplayer in my oblivion
<DarkMemories> xD
<WindKnight114> CoD is the gaming franchise that could use co-op
<Balloons> I don't really know why it matters.
<mib_xosqn3> =/
<Silverscreen> 11But a game like Madness Returns that relies on a story around a single character?
<Ghosties> 4duMORI, that's some awesome dedication to keeping up with a decade old game disk
<SirSprinkles> 6There are quite a few good multiplayer RPGs.
<duMORI> not TES dosen;t work with MP
<CharlesAppleJackson> does FF6 count? where both player 1 and 2 could select attacks
<DarkMemories> Pink is generally more appealing to girls in their opinion. >.>
<CircuitMane> @silverscreen I'm not saying don't do it, just if it's designed for multi then go ahead, but don't force it in if it doesn't fit
<AgnitioExMachina> The toymakers are Chinese
<Darf14> @Silverscreen *cough*Tales of Vesperia*Cough*
<duMORI> belive me I've hacked it in
<Balloons> It's still Celestia pink or white.
<AgnitioExMachina> Don't expect a quality product
<rubenflonne12> FF6 counts as one
<Dashite> Decade old game disks? I still have my original copy of Command and COnquer.
<AgnitioExMachina> except for Chinese dishes and such
<rubenflonne12> as well as earthbound
<mib_xosqn3> same
<AgnitioExMachina> I mean China
<AgnitioExMachina> w.e.
<Silverscreen> 11Anypony hear ever hear of Lost Vikings?
<Dashite> Yes
<Ghosties> 4Kinda like how everyone and their mothers were BEGGING for multiplayer in Skyrim
<CircuitMane> Oh yeah!
<Dee_Twenty> Indeed.
<Darf14> Eeyup
<RainBroDash> I was playing Red Alert 2 tonight ftw when i couldnt sleep
<RainbowSmash> Yeppers
<mib_xosqn3> yep
<Ghosties> 4And then Todd Howard shut them all down
<Silverscreen> 11Sweet
<duMORI> I have the mega drive verson some place
<mib_xosqn3> i love red alert 3
<rubenflonne12> old fun puzzle game
<AgnitioExMachina> Damn Chinese, stealing the jobs of India
<Ghosties> 4I don't, Silver
<mib_xosqn3> red alert 2****
<Silverscreen> 11Any of you want a remake of said game as much as I do?
<AgnitioExMachina> WE SHOULD BE OUTSOURCING MORE TO INDIA
<Ali1017> >.>
<DarkMemories> ...
<RainbowSmash> I think I have an old Diablo disk somewhere
<Dashite> Yes!
<duMORI> TES with MP is just no
<Darf14> Affirmative
<SherlockHooves> Ghosties: Sweet
<rubenflonne12> yes and no
<Silverscreen> 11I mean, that'd be a badass game.
<duMORI> its single player full stop
<DarkMemories> Okay, I don't think we should go into the topic of foreign laborers any further.
<AgnitioExMachina> What?
<Dee_Twenty> I think there was a remake on the GBA.
<duMORI> just liek when the added MP to the fable games and lo it sucked
<rubenflonne12> it just make it to try to match todays "modern" gaming
<CircuitMane> @Ghosties games like that and Fallout 3 would be hazardous for multi, it would probably break the game and ruin the atmosphere to a bit extent
<rubenflonne12> and suger coat it
<Silverscreen> 11Dee_Twenty: That wasn't a remake, it was just a re-release.
<rubenflonne12> sugar**
<AgnitioExMachina> Domestic laborers, then?
<AgnitioExMachina> :D
<SupaScootaloo2> BEST NIGHT EVA
<Dashite> Fallout 3 is already broken. Multi couldn't break it more.
<AgnitioExMachina> Dark, which nationality are you?
<SherlockHooves> Fable 3 was awesome, well I liked it at least
<Ali1017> lets just keep this at ponies
<Ghosties> 4And I agree that multiplayer should never have even been considered for it. Likewise, I'm also glad that multiplayer won't be a problem for Batman Arkham City
<AgnitioExMachina> Oh I just being funny
<Ossala> white made celestia look more holy and powerful, pink makes her look like a princess wannabe
<duMORI> it was ok but the frist is stil better imho
<BlankFlankBrony> lol
<Silverscreen> 11I heard they're puting ROBIN in Arkham City.
<SherlockHooves> yeah, the first one was good
<gingerale> Billions and billions of stars, billions and billions of specks~ <3
<DarkMemories> She is a princess
<Ghosties> 4They're concentrating strictly on first player
<duMORI> fable 3 just isnt as charming or fun
<Ghosties> 4Silverscreen wut?
<AgnitioExMachina> A pretty princess
<Ossala> ik that
<Ghosties> 4Robin?
<DarkMemories> And... well
<guestpony> who here likes batches and horse?
<SherlockHooves> but I really liked the epic feel of Fable 3
<CircuitMane> @SherlockHooves considering Fable 2 you can just say hi to everyone and get enough money to do everything in 20 minutes kills a challenge
<HaxBrony> fable 1 still king
<Ghosties> 4I know Catwoman will be playable in there
<DarkMemories> Ehh, they newed to fix her body type first
<Silverscreen> 11http://gotgame.com/2011/06/16/the-boy-wonder-will-be-in-arkham-city/
<SherlockHooves> I felt so bad when so many of my people died at the end
<duMORI> yeah likely as DLC/bonus challenge maps
<Dee_Twenty> The only thing worse than a game that's got a tacked on multi-player mode is a game that ONLY offers multi-player.
<AgnitioExMachina> Anyways if Celestia got married, would she still be a Princess?
<Darf14> Well this has been the Best Night Eva for me, but its getting late for me so good night everyone, see you all tomorrow! :)
<mib_xosqn3> i like bad religion, they make good music
<mib_xosqn3> lol
<AgnitioExMachina> which is like the highest title
<WindKnight114> oh yeah
<mib_xosqn3> goodnight darf
<AgnitioExMachina> You know what?
<Dashite> Night Darf.
<duMORI> Yeah I guess Fable 3 had that going for it
<guestpony> dont you know how royalness works?
<AgnitioExMachina> She should be called the High Priestess
<RainbowSmash> gnite
<StarShine> HOW COULD YOU
<StarShine> NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<AgnitioExMachina> Yeah, that sounds right
<WindKnight114> WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
<mib_xosqn3> ...
<Ossala> pink makes her look like she's pushing the "princess" title too far, but white makes her look like REAL royalite
<duMORI> but I don't feel anything for my PC he's cut out mac bob
<StarShine> ;w;
<rubenflonne12> fallout veges was okay, they made the brother hood such asses
<mib_2gudet> ?
<AgnitioExMachina> Celestia and Lune the High Priestesses
<Sol> hhhhhhhhhhuuuuuuruuruurururururururrurururururuururuurruuruururuuuruururu
<Pimps_McGee> CHACCARON
<muffin_hooves> Wha?
<Silverscreen> 11What the hell is that song?
<guestpony> who here knows morse code?
<Balloons> Queen Celestia. it's not as catchy xP
<AgnitioExMachina> Luna
<Ghosties> 4Well, at least he won't be actually involved in the sotry
<Ghosties> 4*story
<Dashite> The Brotherhood are supposed to be jerks.
<StarShine> Chacaron
<quicksilver> lulz
<SherlockHooves> Chaccaron
<mib_xosqn3> what is this song called anyway?
<Pimps_McGee> Maccaron Chaccaron
<mib_xosqn3> oh...
<AgnitioExMachina> ...___...
<AgnitioExMachina> SOS
<duMORI> brother hood asses they always have been

<guestpony> who here knows horse code?
<quicksilver> So are they ever going to fix that color of Celestia?
<rubenflonne12> well not i remembered back in the old fallout games
<Nightmare_Moon> No
<RainBroDash> i don't really like single player fps
<rubenflonne12> back in 1 and 2
<CircuitMane> Well I guess then a game should have a solid single player to start off and begin with, and then multiplayer if it works for the game and is designed very well
<AgnitioExMachina> No, prob not
<CharlesAppleJackson> Dee_Twenty, you can play offline.
<StarShine> Because TF2... is a Multiplayer game
<RainBroDash> i casually play multiplayer fps
<CircuitMane> and there's a derpy video for that
<AgnitioExMachina> I don't wanna go into why either as it'll piss the mods off
<Tenaris> i laged and didnt notice
<quicksilver> Oh well, not like I was ever going to buy it anyway
<StarShine> There's.... really no way to make it single... unless you wanna play bots
<guestpony> nightmare moooooooooooooooooooooooooon!
<Tenaris> did i miss anything?
<Dashite> In the first game they sent you into a radioactive deathtrap before they would even talk to you.
<StarShine> That's possible.
<RainbowSmash> CharlesAppleJackson I think he means one against all
<AgnitioExMachina> Herbert MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
<SherlockHooves> YES
<Dee_Twenty> I'd prefer bots, yes.
<Tenaris> cant wait to see a Giga Drill Break in mlp ='D
<SherlockHooves> THOUSAND TIMES YES
<SirSprinkles> 6Sorry about that, was making sure everypony was paying attention still. XD
<guestpony> wait
<DarkMemories> Moooooriella.
<StarShine> It's possible
<DarkMemories> Is the best pony
<guestpony> why dont they have sunny d
<DarkMemories> Discuss if you will.
<rubenflonne12> oh ya.....now you reminded me of that
<mib_xosqn3> YES
<AgnitioExMachina> Tenaris, my drill will pierce the heavens
<guestpony> for the MOOOOOOON
<Dee_Twenty> And a story mode would be nice.
<mib_xosqn3> DEAD PARROT! THANKYOU
<duMORI> lol
<SherlockHooves> this parrot is no more
<SherlockHooves> HE IS DECEASED
<AgnitioExMachina> Moooooriella's a cow, not a pony, silly

<mib_xosqn3> it's not a palladrome! boldon backwards is nodlob!
<rubenflonne12> well brotherhood has good intentions
<Tenaris> Just out of curiousity how did Lyra pop into the popularity so fast?
<AgnitioExMachina> hooah
<Irene> Well guys and girls that's it for me
<guestpony> SITTING
<Ali1017> epic human sit
<Irene> See you all next week
<Dashite> Brotherhood was only interested in technology.
<AgnitioExMachina> Because Lyra's the bench pony
<HaxBrony> filamena. Y U NO HEALTHY
<SherlockHooves> g'night
<Dashite> Fallout 3 turned them into lawful good paladins.
<quicksilver> Screencap? I forgot that scene
<Irene> Take care
<rubenflonne12> for bettering the future
<rubenflonne12> also good night irene
<gingerale> Lyra is to ponies what furries are to humans. :B
<AgnitioExMachina> Someone find it for this sucka
<guestpony> what
<Ali1017> Dragonshy is the episode
<Neon> Oh, hello. Thought I might be too late.
<RainbowSmash> Filamena learns from the best of course
<RainbowSmash> gnite!
<mib_xosqn3> i love this sketch
<Irene> Thanks for a lovely night
<Neon> How's it going?
<duMORI> So did tactics
<Lambda> Good
<Lambda> not too late for me
<Tenaris> And now i know and knowing is half the battle
<Lambda> not on a weekend
<Lambda> :P
<Dashite> Bettering their own future. They weren't sharing anything they had.
<Ali1017> should be in the first few mins after the intro
<Victorian> Because Lyra is Bon Bon's eternal lover.
<Lambda> how about you?
<Neon> Haha, good news, good news.
<Ali1017> GIJOOOOOOOOEE
<Silverscreen> 11It's not pining, it's passed on. This parrot is no more. It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker. This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. THIS. IS AN EX. PARROT!!!
<Tenaris> Yus =D
<Victorian> GI Joe needed more ponies.
<Neon> Not much. Just watched Thor with a friend. Made fun of it throughout.
<mib_xosqn3> look matty
<Lambda> :P
<RainbowSmash> argh
<rubenflonne12> now we need to watch flying circus now x3
<AgnitioExMachina> Bon Bon's lovely
<mib_xosqn3> this parrot would voom if i put 400 volts though it
<CircuitMane> :brohoof Silverscreen
<RainbowSmash> my stream isnt resetting
<Ali1017> to bad they broke them up mid season
<DarkMemories> I just got this awesome image of GI Joe riding Rainbow Dash through the skies.
<AgnitioExMachina> Anyways I still remember the whole Lyra Colgate argument lol
<Lambda> sounds like my way of enjoying a movie
*Silverscreen 11brohoofs back
<gingerale> What? Lyra and Bon-Bon aren't lovers, silly. They're just roommates and best friends. While everyone around them does think they're a couple they're completely oblivious to this.
<AgnitioExMachina> yep
<RainbowSmash> wait nvm
<Sol> Ohhhhh
<guestpony> LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEEEEEEEEEEENKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINS
<SirSprinkles> 6And then buffer.
<Metal_Link> This is still going wow.
<Lambda> depends on the movie really
<Sol> So THIS is where NC got that joke
<Neon> It's too corny to be taken seriously. xD
<Silverscreen> 11dat buffer
<DarkMemories> Firends with benefits =/= lovers
<Neon> But yeah, it depends on the movie.
<Lambda> yeah, I imagine
<Outline> Lyra and Bon bon are as platonic in their relationship as Bert and Ernie.
<guestpony> ew
<RainbowSmash> BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUfer
<AgnitioExMachina> I just got this awesome image of Elipizo riding Rainbow Dash through the skies.
<muffin_hooves> ...pushing up the daisies
<DarkMemories> xD
<Mongoose> I am back
<WindKnight114> WOO HOO OPEN YOUR HEART
<Silverscreen> 11Sol: correct. He's said he's a fan of Flying Circuis.
<AgnitioExMachina> Oh wait, it already exists
<guestpony> what is wrong witch y
<Lambda> I have yet to see it, but I don't imagine myself taking any life lessons from it when I do
<guestpony> y'all*
<CircuitMane> Wow, the secret's out
<AgnitioExMachina> You know, the Italian Assassin's Creed dude
<Silverscreen> 11FUCKING BUFFER!
<Dashite> MOAR BUFFERING!

<Dee_Twenty> Metal_Link YouTube sucks.
<RainbowSmash> meh bandwidth issues
<Dashite> I've never played more than 10 minutes of any Sonic game. >_>
<SherlockHooves> what's that song at the beginning of the game when Sonic is skyboarding after falling out of the helicopter?
<guestpony> who here has ever heard of the legend of zelda?
<AgnitioExMachina> Who here hasn't?
<Victorian> That also needed more ponies.
<guestpony> me
<Silverscreen> 11Dashite: WHAAAAAAAT?!
<LogicalFailure> The guys on the Minecraft topic want a Phineas and Ferb crossover.
<guestpony> NEVER
<DarkMemories> It's a little too obscure for most of you
<WindKnight114> Ive played more than 20 sonic games
<SherlockHooves> anyone know which one I'm talking about?
<Ossala> Legend of Lyra
<guestpony> well

<guestpony> visited my cousin who is an animator for season two
<DarkMemories> LEGEND OF LYRA?
<CircuitMane> lol, I gotta admit they did a good job on the vid so far
<RainbowSmash> I just realized something...
<DarkMemories> Ossala, you just won the internet
<Pinkamina> "Who are we, wakin' with youuuu?"
<rubenflonne12> *blows dust off my old dreamcast*
<Pinkamina> weird lyrics
<Ossala> YAY!!
<RainbowSmash> I still have my old Sonic Racers CD
<guestpony> and got her to draw me epona, mlp style
<AgnitioExMachina> Is Twilight link?
*DarkMemories drafts up a fanfic right away
<TurniBrony> Didn't like Sonic Adventure. :<
<Silverscreen> 11The poor dreamcast.
<Victorian> Is that the one with the space ships or the mines?
<Dee_Twenty> They play this song a lot on Celestia Radio.
<mib_xosqn3> lol ne
<Dashite> Never had access to a console back then. I was strictly PC.
<gingerale> Lyra of Time?
<AgnitioExMachina> As Madmax depicts her?
<Pinkamina> *walkin'
<SherlockHooves> it was the one on the gamecube with Knuckles
<Silverscreen> 11That thing got a beating that it didn't deserve.
<DarkMemories> According to madmax, Twilight is link.
<AgnitioExMachina> yep
<Ghosties> 4The Dreamcast was an awesome console
<DarkMemories> But any pony could fit the part.
<SherlockHooves> and the first game with Shadow
<AgnitioExMachina> That was my reference
<AgnitioExMachina> :D
<mib_xosqn3> i love dreamcats
<Ghosties> 4Too bad it didn't live long T_T
<DarkMemories> Well, actually, it's Lyra of Ages.
<mib_xosqn3> cast...
<CircuitMane> I still have my Dreamcast
<Ossala> BonBon is link :DD
<WindKnight114> Sega Saturn was shit though D:
<mib_xosqn3> yeah
<guestpony> oh
<AgnitioExMachina> Lyra of Seasons
<Lambda> other than the movie, what have you been up to lately?
<rubenflonne12> mine can play playstation games x3
<DarkMemories> From Oracle of ages, where the main instrument was a harp./lyre
<guestpony> i gotta fun idea
<gingerale> BonBon's awakening
<mib_xosqn3> genesis though, was next to godliness
<Silverscreen> 11Ghosties: that's because it kept having shitty games made for it.
<DarkMemories> But yeah.
<guestpony> what is the worst thing about each pony?
<RainBroDash> I WENT AFK AND YOU PLAYED THIS
<DarkMemories> Lyra would fit Link better than Bonbon.
<rubenflonne12> even though i had a playstation x3
<RainBroDash> Q_Q
<Ossala> PonyAge: Oranges
<gingerale> BonBon to the Past
<AgnitioExMachina> lol sillies there was an Oracle of Seasons
<Dee_Twenty> They kind of brought it on themselves with the Dreamcast and their ad campaign of "It's thinking."
<RainBroDash> oh well, jamming along now <3
<AgnitioExMachina> BonBon's Awakening
<LogicalFailure> Well right now the guys on the topic just are getting over a troll attack. I meant to say server.
<Silverscreen> 11It had three good games: Sonic Adventure, Power stone, and Marvel Vs. Capcom.
<Flutterbro> Worst thing about applejack is that she sucks.
<Ghosties> 4But you have to admit that there were some seriously top notch games made for Dreamcast: Sonic Adventure, Shenmue, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio
<Ghosties> 4Dude
<DarkMemories> Ah, I see.
<guestpony> lol
<CircuitMane> Soul Calibur
<rubenflonne12> don't forget MvC2

<gingerale> Dash to the Past would work as a punny name
<Silverscreen> 11oh, and those that you mentioned.
<Ghosties> 4Jet Set Radio was fucking awesome
<AgnitioExMachina> Who's being trolled?
<AgnitioExMachina> ginger, that it would

<AgnitioExMachina> You made a South Park mistake here
<DarkMemories> 4 days without sleep = mistaking vowels, and that's all I'm gunna say
<RainBroDash> ?*
<guestpony> congrats for what
<CircuitMane> @rubenflonne12 okay, my opinion has gone higher on you
<WindKnight114> CircuitMane I do like a lot of CoD, Medal of Honor, Battlefield series, Left for Dead 1 and 2, GTA IV, and almost all the Halo games
<Dashite> You said to skip Trigger.
<duMORI> also I know for a fact I played against Bill Gates in MP
<Lambda> Oh, cool. I've never been to six flags
<gingerale> Aeiou
<RainbowSmash> Tigger? Where?
<rubenflonne12> cross is a nice game, just a crappy sequal
<Snips> Yup yup, prenup.
<AgnitioExMachina> As-in you referenced a episode
<duMORI> on B&W
<guestpony> i did?
<Lambda> Valley Fair though, there I've been twice
<rubenflonne12> a good game on its own
<AgnitioExMachina> and sucessfully got the mods to believe that you were racist
<DarkMemories> Wheel of Fortune mistake
<AgnitioExMachina> Dark ,yep
<ZSabotage> windknight, ya need to play more old games.
<Ghosties> 4WindKnight114...you really should look to the past
<rubenflonne12> cross is a good game on its own**
<DarkMemories> xd
<SherlockHooves> yeah that's the one RainBroDash, I can't play tetris without thinking about it
<LogicalFailure> Were you serious about drafting up a Phineas and Ferb crossover fic, DarkMemories?
<Donraj> "People who annoy you"
<DarkMemories> Lucky I remember that.
<Neon> Really? There aren't any near you, huh?
<DarkMemories> What?
<Bronypeanut> 13ALRIGHTY MY FRIENDS
<DarkMemories> I neever said that...
<CircuitMane> @WindKnight114 Congrats, you convinced me of nothing! So far all I know is you have a FPS fetish with a cut in for GTA
<DarkMemories> O.o
<Bronypeanut> 13I had a great time tonight but I must take my leave
<Lambda> there are, I just haven't been to any
<AgnitioExMachina> pff
<Bronypeanut> 13Love ya all <3

<DarkMemories> I said that the stuff going on there were weird.
<WindKnight114> Like the classic Gensis games and the NES games too, yeah ive played those
<SherlockHooves> Seeyah Brony
<Dee_Twenty> Baldur's Gate trilogy are my favourite games of all time.
<duMORI> Night good sir sleep well
<AgnitioExMachina> Anyways who here thinks Victoria II is a good game and should I get it?
<guestpony> wait
<Neon> Ah. Well, I wonder if I should know what Valley Fair is.
<DarkMemories> I said I was going to draft a fic about the Legend of Lyra.
<RainbowSmash> adieu!
<Lambda> maybe not
<guestpony> can someone explaing what i did?
<AgnitioExMachina> Also who knows how many gigs the expansions are?
<ZSabotage> Aeiou
<Dashite> But why would you tell him to skip the better game?
<Lambda> it's like six flags, but there's only one
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original vid was for a College project.
<CircuitMane> But no SNES in there
<RainbowSmash> dammit i wanna listen to this song
<RainbowSmash> but im lagging

<HaxBrony> gah. 1130 here not that late. but i got stuff 2 do. Im out too.
<AgnitioExMachina> nagger simular to n*gger
<quicksilver> @DarkMemories, why haven't you slept in 4 days and why are you on here if that's the case? You got pony dedication, pretty seriously I might add.
<SherlockHooves> why is Applejack a Commie?
<Neon> Oh, gotcha. The CT equivalent is Lake Compounce.
<Lambda> Ah
<AgnitioExMachina> Nogger
<guestpony> no, besides that
<DarkMemories> Yeah, quite.
<AgnitioExMachina> aeiou
<Ossala> i don't see how the N word is racist....and i don't see how black guys can say it to echother, but if a white guy says it to a black guy, he gets pissed.. that seems more racist to me..
<Lambda> yeah, I haven't heard of that one
<Dee_Twenty> Because apples are red, and red represents communism.
<mib_xosqn3> no idea
<Dashite> Also Dee_Twenty is cool.
<guestpony> i was called a cracker
<DarkMemories> I had to finish a full semester of an online class in two days.
<Flutterbro> Is it just me or is Vinyl Scratch a way better name than DJ-Pon3?
<quicksilver> *shakes head*
<Lambda> Valley Fair is Minnesota
<guestpony> i cried
<AgnitioExMachina> There is a difference, cracker
<mib_xosqn3> why does blocks have everythign to do with communism?
<gingerale> Ooooooohhh
<DarkMemories> So I was awake 48 straight hours.
<Lambda> here in Wisconsin we have the Wisconsin Dells
<Ghosties> 4Hey, Sprinkles, I got something for you to stream
<gingerale> A new Voodoopony album

<ZSabotage> Firetrucks are red because they're always rushin'.
<Lambda> a whole city of water parks and theme parks
<SirSprinkles> 6?
<DarkMemories> But now I can't fall asleep.
<Lambda> that place is fun
<Dee_Twenty> Tetris is a Russian game.
<Neon> Haha, that sounds amazing.
<CircuitMane> @Dee_twenty but apple pie is american
<Balloons> Dark i suggest you get some sleep. it's not healthy
<DarkMemories> So I fill it with ponies.
<Silverscreen> 11Anon: Tetris was a game from Russia.
<RainBroDash> blocks, as in tetris, as in that russian popular puzzle game :L
<rubenflonne12> its the symbolization of even if you build, it will go no where
<AgnitioExMachina> Dark, get sleeping pills
<mib_xosqn3> sabatoge that was a terrible pun
<DarkMemories> Too bad I'm leaving for a week.
<guestpony> OMG I CANST BELIIIIIIIEEEEVEEEEE that you SAID THAT
<DarkMemories> I'm going to sleep.
<The_Linker> DJ-Pon3 is cool in writing, but sounds awkward in speech.
<AgnitioExMachina> And don't die from sleep deprivation
<guestpony> lol
<ZSabotage> I have worse
<Neon> Sort of like Ocean City in Maryland.
<Lambda> yeah, I've been there once a year as long as I can remember
<guestpony> hello crashstuntman
<DarkMemories> Got a 10 hour car ride up to a wifi-less cabin in Georgia today.
<RainBroDash> this is too fast for me >.<
<Silverscreen> 11So the theme of it was turned to tell the history of the USSR
<RainBroDash> bloody tetris theme
<ZSabotage> Two goldfish in a tank, one says "you shoot, I drive"
<mib_xosqn3> and yeah i know it's the tetris theme song -_-
<RainbowCrash> tht sux
<AgnitioExMachina> And you're doing that while you're tired?
<DarkMemories> So, plenty of time for sleep, don't worry.
<rubenflonne12> pretty much
<AgnitioExMachina> Or are you a passenger?
<Ghosties> 4Sprinks, check your messages
<duMORI> it's a "pro" comunisum song to tetirs song
<RainbowCrash> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N57VrjyD_r8
<mib_xosqn3> yep
<guestpony> wait
<DarkMemories> Ride, not drive.
<Lambda> at one of the waterparks they have this deal where if your report card has at least one A on it you can get in free
<quicksilver> sounds fun, except for the 10 hour drive
<guestpony> you're a mod?
<DarkMemories> Thank god.
<AgnitioExMachina> k lol
<Lambda> they call it A-Day
<Balloons> No distractions Dark mean you might get some sleep i think.
<DarkMemories> Half-mod.
<AgnitioExMachina> Dark is a mod
<Neon> LOL
<AgnitioExMachina> Well half mod
<Lambda> and it applies for college students too :D
<mib_xosqn3> god damn those commies making a catchy song
<Neon> Can you forge a report card?
<guestpony> GASP{

<Lambda> :P
<Ossala> gotta rejoin
<DarkMemories> It doesn't really mean anything.
<AgnitioExMachina> and...what was admin again?
<Silverscreen> 11DuMORI: actually, it does a good job at explaining both the pros and cons of communisim.
<mib_xosqn3> dee_twenty, what is the skin's format?
<RainbowSmash> I'm out, net is crappin out. Gnite Bronies!
<The_Linker> And Seth is ~, right
<The_Linker> ?
<Lambda> NO CLUE how she gets away with it though XD
<DarkMemories> I just have the ability to kick people.
<Ghosties> 4You may not have liked the game, but you gotta admit the music was awesome as shit
<mib_xosqn3> goodnight
<AgnitioExMachina> What's Fireant's symbol?
<Lambda> She looks young, sure, but 16?
<Balloons> admin is &
<RainbowSmash> wait no after this song lol

<DarkMemories> Which really is insignificant to my presence here as a brony
<rubenflonne12> and free
<AgnitioExMachina> &
<Silverscreen> 11It does mention how Stalin abused the system for his own gain, and how it smothered the people of the union in the worst of times.
<DarkMemories> I haven't kicked anypony yet, don't want to have to
<Pimps_McGee> Make way for the Chaotix son
<Neon> I assume it's not that thorough. Just like birthday benefits. at restaurants.
<guestpony> who here likes PONIES
<quicksilver> That wired article where they interviewed Seth was interesting.
<guestpony> question mark
<Lambda> Yeah
<rubenflonne12> yup
<mib_xosqn3> ur not my father.
<DarkMemories> I'm just here to keep the chat in line when I need to.
<LogicalFailure> I like ponies.
<Neon> Er, omit the random period that found its way into that sentence.
<The_Linker> Ponies!?
<guestpony> oh
<Dee_Twenty> Not sure. I know I saw somepony post an image of a mod to ride Big Mac on Ponibooru, but no download link.
<guestpony> that makes sense
<Donraj> Ponies are wonderful
<AgnitioExMachina> That Wired article was awkward as I have ever seen
<Ali1017> PONIES
<mib_xosqn3> lol
<Lambda> they probably could care less who they let in as long as they get payed
<Snips> SEINOP
<AgnitioExMachina> Seriously, that fucking creeper at the top of the article?
<guestpony> who here has ridden one before?
<DarkMemories> @guestpony: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tZMYryMyBE

<mib_xosqn3> wait what is the image format for the skin? i could try my hand at it if it's easy enough
<AgnitioExMachina> I hate horses

<AgnitioExMachina> They're fuggin stupid
<duMORI> Though the cons camethough to me in sacasum plus I was AFK for a bit of it
<AgnitioExMachina> But I love ponies
<RainbowSmash> the power of the ponies has brought my internet back to life!
<AgnitioExMachina> Esp drawn ones
<ZSabotage> there needs to be a mod for fallout or oblivion that changes player and NPC models to ponies.
<mib_xosqn3> lol
<AgnitioExMachina> Am I weird
<AgnitioExMachina> ???
<RainBroDash> NOT BYE THEN

<Lambda> In order to keep it from getting crowded though, you have to be signed up for their email newsletter to know when it is
<AgnitioExMachina> year!
<DarkMemories> >implying he could change horses to make them better xD
<guestpony> no offense, dues extra machina
<mib_xosqn3> ?
<Lambda> finally a benefit to spam email
<Lambda> :P
<mib_xosqn3> oh
<mib_xosqn3> duh...
<The_Linker> For some reason, I think it'd be kinda funny if a horse showed up in Ponyville.
<AgnitioExMachina> guest, none taken
<guestpony> cool
<AgnitioExMachina> I know how bizarre it seems
<Dee_Twenty> I really have no idea, probably tex but I'm not sure.
<AgnitioExMachina> But I don't like real ponies that much either
<guestpony> yeah
<Ghosties> 4LOL Shining
<guestpony> kinda
<guestpony> why?
<RainBroDash> xD
<RainBroDash> wtf
<The_Linker> Having just rode in from horseville.
<Dashite> lol
<AgnitioExMachina> Probably because they're too much like horses
<DarkMemories> They're not cartoon ponies.
<Snips> Isn't princess CElestia a horse given her size?
<Tenaris> Wait wait wait i just noticed this and everpony must know
<Neon> Ah, I see. Does it really get sent to Spam?
<Silverscreen> 11o.o
<guestpony> what?
<AgnitioExMachina> And they're not cartoon ponies
<AgnitioExMachina> yep
<Dashite> HERE'S FLUTTERSHY!
<DarkMemories> She's a god.
<Silverscreen> 11what the fuck...
<RainBroDash> xD
<DarkMemories> Well, sorta.
<mib_xosqn3> if it isnt too annoying ill make a mlp horse skin for oblivion
<DarkMemories> But, whatever.
<Lambda> depends on your email client
<Tenaris> SUPREME OVERLORD CELETIA
<rubenflonne12> meh bad edit x3 was expecting it through the door
<Tenaris> but yeah
<CircuitMane> there's a vid?
<Lambda> I don't think it does for my mom though
<guestpony> celetia?
<rubenflonne12> x3 heres jonny
<quicksilver> Yeah, I always wondered about her size/ shape relative to all her subjects
<guestpony> who dat
<muffin_hooves> Yes!
<AgnitioExMachina> I'd ride Celestia all day...on some horse trails
<DarkMemories> She's an alicorn, and presumably much, much, muchhhh older than any other pony except maybe Luna.
<mib_xosqn3> YES
<Lambda> or else she'd never know about it
<quicksilver> even her cousin (?) wasn't like her at all
<mib_xosqn3> MY FAVORIT POLKA
<guestpony> what is a celetia?
<RainbowSmash> Love the Flutter! LOVE HER!
<AgnitioExMachina> And maybe the sky <3
<Dee_Twenty> YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME!
<Tenaris> There hasnt been any Ponifyed version Street fighter Guile yet =0
<mib_xosqn3> FULY MEMORIZED
<guestpony> this is NEW
<AgnitioExMachina> PRINCESS CELETIA
<guestpony> oh
<AgnitioExMachina> YAA
<guestpony> wait
<Neon> I look through Spam every once in a while, since it tends to detain stuff that is actually important.
<Ali1017> change that name please
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm a weird al freak. Deal.
<Tenaris> Snips?
<mib_xosqn3> me too
<guestpony> can someone esplain someting please?
<RainBroDash> SOAD xD
<RainBroDash> lololololol
<Lambda> yeah, same here
<mib_xosqn3> it open a world of other songs for me
<mib_xosqn3> so now i liek most sogs
<guestpony> why does everyone mock that one pony?
<LogicalFailure> Who need's to ride an Alicorn? Just have her use her telekinetic powers to fly you around.
<AgnitioExMachina> I think the size of an Alicorn is the Alicorn's power level
<guestpony> the crosseyed one?
<RainBroDash> THE VINES
<Lambda> when helping my mom with computer problems though I noticed she gets a lot of it
<RainBroDash> LOVE THIS SONG
<Lambda> way too much to filter through
<AgnitioExMachina> Luna will become as large as Celestia once she gets her power back
<guestpony> what is everyone mocking her for?
<AgnitioExMachina> And Derpy? Go ahead
<Tenaris> WAIT YOUR MOCKING THE MONOCOL EYE TOP HAT WEARING PONY CAESAR =0
<Neon> Yeah, I can imagine.
<DarkMemories> What does Derpy have to do with anything?
<AgnitioExMachina> Derpy is the best pony
<The_Linker> Aww, then Luna wouldn't be even half as cute.
<AgnitioExMachina> Derpy is always relevant
<guestpony> why dost most mock her?
<quicksilver> an alicorn would be too proud to give people a ride on their backs, that is for a lesser being. She will use telekinesis to fly you around.
<rubenflonne12> i know weird al irl, great guy
<AgnitioExMachina> Linker, no, she'll be HAWT
<mib_xosqn3> cool
<calvindapanda> hi bronies
<guestpony> just for her odd eyes
<Tenaris> Dittzy Derpy Doo iswin
<mib_xosqn3> i always hoped he was
<mib_xosqn3> hi
<RainBroDash> hai calvin :)
<Neon> A lot of my SAT stuff was caught in spam, and since it's sent to my mom's email I missed crucial stuff I needed before taking it.
<Silverscreen> 11ruben: cool story, bro
<RainbowSmash> hey hey!
<rubenflonne12> its funny, it was not intentional to meet him x3
<AgnitioExMachina> quicksilver >implying I won't be a demigod myself by then
<Dee_Twenty> Al so needs to appear in season 2.
<Lambda> Oh wow
<Lambda> that must've been bad
<RainBroDash> the strokes <3
<The_Linker> What do you mean mock her? Who mocks her? You been by drawing comics where she acts loopy?
<The_Linker> *You mean by
<Dee_Twenty> Pinkie and Al doing an epic polka battle.
<Lambda> my sister just did her ACT last weekend
<Neon> Ended up not being able to get in, since the ticket was in there. >_<
<Silverscreen> 11AH! PRE 4-GEN!
<calvindapanda> lol
<DarkMemories> Watch it Agnitio, asking (or implying) for a mod position gets you nowhere.
<DarkMemories> xP
<calvindapanda> this is perfect
<Silverscreen> 11IT BURNS!
<RainBroDash> hahaha OOO-AH-AH-AH-AH
<AgnitioExMachina> I wasn't asking for a mod position, silly

<AgnitioExMachina> I AM SICK WITH DEMIGOD POWER
<AgnitioExMachina> FEAR ME
<RainbowSmash> Someone call the power of the ponies! My net is starting to crap out again!
<Orpheon> Why?
<LogicalFailure> *Shepard voice* Charge.
<RainBroDash> i think i ruptured my spleen at this polka, can't believe i've never heard it
<The_Linker> Some people go mad with power.
*Silverscreen 11wonders if somepony did THEY'RE COMING TO TAKE ME AWAY with Pinkie yet...
<RainBroDash> MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY
<The_Linker> I go mad WITHOUT power.
<AgnitioExMachina> Mao Zedong for one
<Neon> I won't need to the ACT for the colleges I'm looking at, but it wouldn't hurt to take it.
<AgnitioExMachina> lol
<The_Linker> It's really boring.
<Sol> Goodnight bronies! See you next friday, and you guys, again, fucking rock!
<Orpheon> I'm already mad.
<SirSprinkles> 6@Silver I hope so
<RainBroDash> cya Sol! <3
<Dashite> Night Sol!
<AgnitioExMachina> I'm insane enough as it is
<DarkMemories> PEARZ ABUZ is bad. xP
<mib_xosqn3> rainbrodash, ingest more polka song or you will be sad that youve never herd all of them
<LogicalFailure> Who needs power?
<mib_xosqn3> they are amazing
<LogicalFailure> Power is for wimps.
<RainbowSmash> gnite sol!
<Orpheon> Nobody.
<AgnitioExMachina> I NOT ASKING FOR TEH PEAR
<Lambda> what colleges are you looking at?
<DarkMemories> How ironic.
<SirSprinkles> 6I used to have to listen to that song every hour or so when I worked at a Halloween store. I loved it.
<mib_xosqn3> and there are some good 80's music polkas too
<RainBroDash> the songs in it though, ASFIJAIKOFAHFN

<AgnitioExMachina> LIFE PEAR MEBE

<Orpheon> Who else is a godkiller besides me?
<Neon> UConn, Southern... both local colleges.
<AgnitioExMachina> Orph, I am a godkillerkiller
<Lambda> Ah
<Neon> I prefer to commute.
<AgnitioExMachina> deal /w it
<RainBroDash> oh, any bronies Incubus fans?
<Lambda> it's local for me too
<SirSprinkles> 6Oh, yeah.
<Silverscreen> 11It's not that good.
<Silverscreen> 11http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWfQ_PrjAQE
<Orpheon> Celestia and Luna are exceptions.
<LogicalFailure> I'm just a random guy who likes ponies and sometimes chats or forums about it.
<Silverscreen> 11but it's there.
<Lambda> nice for when you have arrangements you don't have to change them over summer
<Orpheon> Have a cookie for being honest

<RainBroDash> bloody backstreet boys
<SirSprinkles> 6SPAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<The_Linker> Equestria Daily's really growing. I've had three PMVs posted, and each post gets way more comments than the last, and way more views come from ED than ever before...
<rubenflonne12> i miss the 80-90 i don't know why, its not because i was a kid, its just...i don't know i just feel simpler times i guess and when people gave a shit of stuff
<duMORI> omfg I forgot I could make coffe this good on tap
<The_Linker> Community's still growing. It's nice.
<Nopony> yeah tbh it's sort of insane
<mib_xosqn3> i agree ruben
<duMORI> but I I think i recall why I forgot
<Silverscreen> 11Am I the only guy here who didn't mind the Backstreet Boys and N'Sync?
<RainBroDash> ruben the majority of us agree :)
<Orpheon> Soon the world will be ours...
<SirSprinkles> 6duMORI... I dislike you right now.
<RainBroDash> I don't mind it silver :)
<SirSprinkles> 6I want coffee.
<Orpheon> Just kidding
<Nopony> Like, I've gotten more comments on my pony remix than any of my other music ever
<SirSprinkles> 6Haven't had any in DAYS.
<Dee_Twenty> On the other hand the 80's and 90's didn't have the epic anti-fail of FiM.
<RainbowSmash> Does anyone know if there are some PMVs of either Billy Mays or the SlapChop guy?
<duMORI> I am making fresh ecpresso
<Nopony> combined
<calvindapanda> nice
<duMORI> it is soooo good
<rubenflonne12> this is true
<calvindapanda> esspresso is delicious
<SirSprinkles> 6Then again, I haven't even had food in over 24 hours.
<RainbowSmash> i remember seeing one somewhere
<duMORI> just really nice beans too
<rubenflonne12> so it balances itself
<calvindapanda> ...
<calvindapanda> ok
<Silverscreen> 11Dee_Tweenty: Then again, 80's and 90's didn't NEED an anti-fail show
<Orpheon> Does anypony know how to make animations?
<calvindapanda> this song
<calvindapanda> :D
<duMORI> lol SirSprinkles
<quicksilver> Is it just me or does this site/community move at such a breakneck speed that it is hard to keep up.
<calvindapanda> lol
<The_Linker> Yes, JUST KIDDING, to any world leaders that may be watching. Ha ha! We're so silly, and just joking. Yup. Nothing more.
<Brony> Hi
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm broke, I don't eat much.
<RainBroDash> the dope show
<duMORI> I spent the 24 hour prior to brony moive night ion bed with a migraine
<RainBroDash> lmao
<Nopony> I swear I have a backlog of like fifty fics I'm working my way through
<calvindapanda> what is this video called?
<LogicalFailure> All of a sudden Bronies are outlawed in all countries.
<duMORI> so yeah not much eatting here
<calvindapanda> oh ok
<RainbowSmash> SirSprinkles! Get some nutrition in you, or the Flutterstare you shall see
<The_Linker> Seriously though, we should have this planet locked down by the end of S2.
<Silverscreen> 11Calvin...
<RainBroDash> xD
<calvindapanda> got it
<calvindapanda> lol
<calvindapanda> :D

<calvindapanda> yeah

<DarkMemories> Interesting picture
<duMORI> yeah I'm making a themios of ecrpesso cos I can
<calvindapanda> aw
<Nopony> That's canon
<ZSabotage> I spent all day pulling parts off my car only to come inside to watch Starship Troopers with a bunch of Bronies. My day was awesome.
<Brony> I would vote for Duke Nukem
<Dee_Twenty> @RainbowSmash I don't think the promise of seeing Fluttershy is the best argument. :p
<Orpheon> BroBama.
<duMORI> screw maikng coffee i can have coffee +
<Brony> He's gotta be a brony
<SirSprinkles> 6Last thing I ate was a bunch of muffins yesterday.
<RainBroDash> MUFFINS
<DarkMemories> We need to get the Brony party to take over the Senate and House
<calvindapanda> i just earned 170$ doing IT for this guy who just got a new mac
<Nopony> obrony
<calvindapanda> so i have food

<duMORI> mufins and coffee really the way to my heart
<gingerale> The Equestrian Social Democratic Party?
<duMORI> or whisky
<RainBroDash> so all is good
<Orpheon> Thank you.
<DarkMemories> And once we rule america, we make everything better with Friendship and magic, and rename it to Equestria
<muffin_hooves> On that note, good night.
<rubenflonne12> heh
<Derpy> 11Muuufiiiins
<mib_xosqn3> sabotage, you obviousy dont know many mac users XD
<Orpheon> Europe will be named...
<duMORI> damn you I'm broke
<ZSabotage> well shit, i could do that
<Pat> Since the background music is a differn't genre of music for every character, if Al ever does appear on the show his background music must be polka. An accordian at least.
<The_Linker> I worry now that I'll only be able to view S2 in the context of "How cool would THIS shot look in a PMV!?"
<quicksilver> One side note, DNF was a bit of a let down for me. That's all I got to say. Keeping it on Ponies
<RainBroDash> rofl silver
<RainBroDash> why, just why
<calvindapanda> well i had to set up all his VPN tunnels, RDP, and other shit
<DarkMemories> Then we take over the rest of the world with friendship, love, and if needed, toleration
<gingerale> Eruope will be known as Lunar Republic
<Flutterbro> Hmm....
<gingerale> *Europe
<The_Linker> I'll get all distracted.
<duMORI> I shoudl really sign up to job seakers as I've been umempolyed for a year XD
<Flutterbro> How many people usually vote in american presidential elections?
<Silverscreen> 11I love this vid
<capt_slowpoke> I didn't even bother with it, I just played STALKER instead
<calvindapanda> lol
<Orpheon> Cupcakes.
<Flutterbro> and how many american bronies are there
<calvindapanda> duMOR
<Flutterbro> Hmmmmmmmmmm
<quicksilver> I like the title "Lunar Republic" a lot.
<calvindapanda> u should go get a job
<duMORI> but then I did have 7.6K in dispoable savings
<Silverscreen> 11It makes up for the fact that Eggman is such a fail name for the guy
<calvindapanda> ah
<Nightmare_Moon> I just found my new background http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25504
<calvindapanda> thats pretty nice
<rubenflonne12> hehe he is so intelligent but so stupid at the same time
<Orpheon> That short pause was worth saying it.
<quicksilver> *saved*
<The_Linker> Holy CRAP.
<Nopony> We need more nightmare moon fanmedia
<Orpheon> THANK YOU NOPONY
<Flutterbro> god dammit ponibooru

<Orpheon> We need more Psychoshy.
*Silverscreen 11will never acknowledge Robotnik as Eggman on my own.
<Brony> What about a decent Luna fic?
<RainbowSmash> :D
<Nightmare_Moon> Ah Nopony, how has your family lineage been?
<Flutterbro> Dear god that is a nice pic
<rubenflonne12> robotnik will always be robotnik to me
<rubenflonne12> never eggman

<capt_slowpoke> I have yet to read a decent fanfic
<capt_slowpoke> doh ho ho
<gingerale> Hmm.. Africa then.. Zecorian.. something..

<Nopony> Luna VS everything is hilarious
<ZSabotage> wasnt Robotnik explained as someone else in Adventure XD?
<quicksilver> How much fic do you guys read? I havn't read any of it yet.
<rubenflonne12> no sorry mib
<RainbowSmash> oh god this one
<Silverscreen> 11Eggman was his nickname Japan gave him since the first game.
<SirSprinkles> 6This reminds me... I need to have more GET battles in King's tournament...
<duMORI> oh yay! Love this and the memorys it brings
<Nopony> I am addicted to fics
<Orpheon> I've had an idea for an epic story involving Nightmare Moon.
<The_Linker> I haven't read any fan fiction. Don't really plan to. D:
<LogicalFailure> I read everything that's not shipping
<capt_slowpoke> Whenever I want to read a fanfic I just read Doom: Repercussions of Evil
<rubenflonne12> also yay for YGO abridged
<UxieLover1994> 13Uxie here!
<LogicalFailure> Or already too long to read.
<Silverscreen> 11what the fuck is this?
<Nopony> Some shipping is okay, imho
<duMORI> I am back with a FULL cup of expreso
<Ghosties> 4RANDOM GAME FACT: I used to call Robotnik "Robo Tink" when I was a little kid because I couldn't pronounce his name correctly
<Icy> hi
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a parody of a parody
<Brony> Agreed
<UxieLover1994> 13Hey!
<Nopony> Like some of it's really cleverly done
<Nopony> IMHO
<RainBroDash> haha ghosties
<duMORI> of a parody IIRC
<Brony> like Spark
<Misti> cute
<ZekeS> and then capt_slowpoke was the demons
<RainBroDash> you so random
<Icy> How's it goin?
<Nopony> just not the cliche ohhh our horns are touching stuff
<capt_slowpoke> it's the crowning pinnacle of literature
<RainbowSmash> aw you must've been cute ghosties
<Silverscreen> 11wow...
<Silverscreen> 11this vid is...
<UxieLover1994> 13Good. Exept the ShoutWiki site is down, again!
<Silverscreen> 11so stupid.
<Ghosties> 4Hey, it was relevant when we were showing The Real Eggman
<Nopony> no! You will be KILLED BY PARASPRITES
<rubenflonne12> hehe surprised the world is not imploding in on itself
<Orpheon> Shadows of Nightmare Moon slowly possess the Mane Six...
<Nopony> okay someone remake that story w. ponies
<Pimps_McGee> Oh please do the White Wedding: Literal Video Version
<ZekeS> Oh come on
<ZekeS> at least hilite Nightmare_Moon if you're going to talk about her
<Nopony> Actually that's what I'm doing right now
<Ghosties> 4I was totally cute, RainbowSmash :3
<LogicalFailure> We need to mash five crossovers in one story.
<duMORI> yeah well the orginal leather pants had a found spoting my heart due to a night out with a massive crush of mine
<rubenflonne12> also play take me on literal :3
<quicksilver> maybe they would be corrupted like during their trials in the second episode
<Orpheon> I HATE crossovers...
<Silverscreen> 11This actually makes the original song sound like an award winner
<Brony> What if there was a crossover of MLP and Doom?
<Orpheon> No.
<Nopony> The crossover with all the other gens of pony+transformers was fucking hysterical
<Icy> Aww that sucks :(
<mib_xosqn3> well this is a wierd video
<mib_xosqn3> and yet funny
<calvindapanda> mkay this video is
<Nopony> Doom has almost zero plot already, so it wouldn't be hard
<quicksilver> Give them time >_>
<calvindapanda> kinda pissing me off...
<duMORI> though another night out with her wins for weirdist moment ever fucking slowdaceing to I Jizzed my Pants
<mib_xosqn3> lol
<mib_xosqn3> i dont even like lady gaga...
<Silverscreen> 11can't...handle it.
<Silverscreen> 11I muted the vid. x.x
<Nopony> The applebloom silent hill crossover was really funny and cute too
<Ghosties> 4Why is this playing?
<Metal_Link> Oh hey
<Ghosties> 4Who suggested it?
<Orpheon> Dash becomes (obviously) Nightmare Dash, and Shadowshy...
<Nopony> and legitimately haunting
<mib_xosqn3> hey what about the "i threw it on the ground: thing?
<rubenflonne12> not sure x3
<Lambda> hmm
<Lambda> what to do, what to do
<duMORI> cos YGOTAS is win?
<RainbowSmash> Noone i think
<Nightmare_Moon> Ah, let the shadowbolts rise.
<gingerale> Hmmm..
<Flashgen> hello random bronies who I don't know at all
<capt_slowpoke> It has all the plot it needs
<Nopony> sup brahny
<Orpheon> I've designed Nightmare Dash's armor.
<Ghosties> 4I think SirSprinkles should stream better stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Silverscreen> 11GHOST NAPPA!
<Nopony> very true, games should really have less plot
<Silverscreen> 11This vid got 20% cooler
<UxieLover1994> 13That's where the wiki DSD and I came from is
<UxieLover1994> 13But that also means DSD and I will be more active at Spyropedia
<Orpheon> It's pretty akin to her personality
<Flashgen> oh, this sounds interesting to walk in to
<gingerale> Fluttershy, AppleJack and Rarity would be Prospit dreamers and.. Rainbow Dash, Pinkie Pie and Twilight Sparkle would be Derse dreamers. <3
<Nightmare_Moon> Rainbow Doom sounds like a better name
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm playing whatever.
<Neon> I don't know what to do with myself. I had a fusion of Monster and Red Bull about an hour ago.
<Nopony> wtf are we talking about?
<Neon> Then my buddy crashed.
<SirSprinkles> 6Somepony asked for this video.
<duMORI> lol
<Orpheon> Rainbow Death
<duMORI> oddly not me
<Lambda> XD nice
<Nopony> is this doom still, or what?
<rubenflonne12> ghost nappa will never leave vageta alone :D
<LogicalFailure> Ponies, I guess.
<Ghosties> 4You should totally stream JJBATAS
<Lambda> so now you're the only one up?
<Brony> A Doom/MLP crossover
<RainbowSmash> wadun't me
<Dee_Twenty> Play the Sea Ponies song, it's really catchy.
<Silverscreen> 11how long is this damn vid?
<ZSabotage> play the eurobeat Brony vs. Alex S. Luna video
<Flashgen> that sounds like an interesting crossover
<Neon> Yup. xD He has to get up early, so I understand, but now what do I do?
<duMORI> lmao YGOTAS
<Nopony> okay how about ponies+The Longest Journey
<rubenflonne12> oh x3 its a playlist x3
<quicksilver> Nightmare Dash Armor? Image plz?
<gingerale> Twilight's planet would be filled with dragons as consorts, Spike being one of the consorts through time travel shenanigans.
<Orpheon> Oh, wait... When did Nightmare Moon get here?
<Lambda> yeah, I'm feeling the same way
<Nopony> imho best video game ever
<Lambda> I don't want sleep
<Lambda> Nor am I tired
<Brony> WIT
<capt_slowpoke> I will attempt to draw a cacodemon in the style of FiM
<Brony> WAIT
<Nightmare_Moon> Orpheon, I've been here all your life.
<Flashgen> granted, I still want to lengthen my Geass/MLP crossover to hopefully get it up
<Icy> k cool
<Lambda> but I don't know what to do
<DarkMemories> Ever since the 1000 years were up, Orpheon
<Brony> What about MLP/Duke Nukem 8D
<Silverscreen> 11A ROCK?!
<Orpheon> Frightening.
<RainBroDash> PINKIE AND THE BRAIN
<RainBroDash> YES
<Ghosties> 4Gilbert Gottfried: DUMB ROCK
<capt_slowpoke> you mean 3D right?
<RainBroDash> THE OTHER'S INSANEW
<mib_xosqn3> lol
<Orpheon> Actually... I've been here since you and your sister were Foals.
<Silverscreen> 11:D
<Flashgen> nope, 8 Dimensions
<Nopony> Duke would so look baller riding dashie
<The_Linker> Ppth.
<Brony> 8D is a smiley face
<quicksilver> :]
<duMORI> sooo much caffine soo bitter soo gooooooooood
<rubenflonne12> how about literal version of take me on x3 thats pretty funny one x3
<Flashgen> we gotta invent 4 of them
<The_Linker> That's five dimensions too few.
<Flashgen> but I'm sure it won't take long
<The_Linker> Mainstream.
<Orpheon> Fell from the sky...
<Metal_Link> Was this written for My Little Pony or Yu-Gi-Oh
<Nopony> I think we can all agree we need a pony FPS
<Neon> Hm... I'm just looking at UConn's site now.
<Orpheon> I used to be known as Andromeda...
<duMORI> Metal_Link ygotas
<Ghosties> 4I"m muting this one
<Ghosties> 4No thank you
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Nopony> I mean there are platformers, a couple MMOS and a rutting fighting game
<SirSprinkles> 6TROLOLOLOLOL
<Lambda> That's productive
<Pat> Why does this fit Twilight and Pinkie perectly?
<Nopony> we need an FPonyS
<Ghosties> 4I hate you SirSprinkles
<RainBroDash> yeah I dislike this xD
<Ghosties> 4So much right now
<Silverscreen> 11We should start watching some Yu-Gi-OH and DBZ Abridged
<SirSprinkles> 6Just messing with you.
<RainbowSmash> Wheee!
<Lambda> I should follow your example and do something productive!
<rubenflonne12> best pause ever
<Lambda> hmmm
<Ghosties> 4WE NEED TO SEE SOME GODDAMN HOKUTO NO KEN
<duMORI> I have almost a pint of ecpresso im in god damn heaven.
<Misti> hah
<The_Linker> I really want to play that fighting game.
<Neon> "The University of Connecticut's Waterbury campus serves more than 1,000 students annually." I lovr how they try to make it sound like that's a lot.
<Brony> How would it work?
<Ghosties> 4FIST OF THE NORTHSTAR
<Silverscreen> 11Hokuto no ken?
<Neon> *love
<calvindapanda> lol
<Pimps_McGee> nope.avi
<Dee_Twenty> Toei had Team Four Star's newer videos pulled from YouTube.
<mib_xosqn3> can we do older song? im not really likeing the mordern songs
<Lambda> Hahaha, yeah
<rubenflonne12> x.x
<ZSabotage> Vanilla coke. that is all.
<Silverscreen> 11buffer?
<SirSprinkles> 6Trolling so hard.
<calvindapanda> ugh
<Flashgen> how do any fps games work? you shoot bad guys
<capt_slowpoke> no flutter ponies, those would be OP
<calvindapanda> keesshhaa
<Nopony> I'm thinking something class-based, like Team fortress 2
<Ghosties> 4Fist of the North Star, which is just about the manliest fucking anime you'll ever see
<rubenflonne12> *turns off my headphones*
<mib_xosqn3> actually brb anyway, gotta get mroe caffine
<RainBroDash> mfw Ke$ha is a guilty pleasure of mine. HATERS GONNA HATE HARD
<Neon> That's a little bit more thna my high school.
<Neon> *than
<Silverscreen> 11ah
<ZSabotage> meh.
<Nopony> So like, there are flying ponies, ponies w. magic, applejack has tons of HP, etc..
<ZSabotage> YES
<calvindapanda> its true, ponies make everything better
<calvindapanda> even kesha
<Lambda> is that the population of the entire campus, or just freshman?
<Brony> In an MLP FPS, what are you supposed to shoot with?
<Silverscreen> 11The Street Fighter version of this song is better :P
<ZSabotage> make it 720.
<Nopony> 32 player multiplayer on cloudsdale
<Jazza_> Hey guys
<ZSabotage> sounds better
<Ghosties> 4Also muting this
<Nopony> magic? apples? Take your pick
<Neon> Well, it says annually, but that could mean either thing.
<UxieLover1994> 13Spyropedia's got less pages, and a bigger mess, but I don't mind.
<mib_xosqn3> =(
<Balloons> hey
<Brony> true
<capt_slowpoke> miniguns
<Metal_Link> Are there any good PMVs? In b4 lol good PMVs
<Neon> Incoming or total.
<duMORI> only 38 left :(
<Nopony> Apples could make okay grenades
<DarkMemories> AJ chose apples.
<Lambda> yeah, that's why I'm confused
<mib_xosqn3> instead of muting, hw about to get a cup of coffee or soemthing
<Jazza> They used apple pies
<Nopony> Aj should have a dash ability
<duMORI> There are some
<CharlesAppleJackson> this video <3
<UxieLover1994> 13That means I can hit big points!
<Neon> I'm going to assume that's all, though. xD
<Silverscreen> 11I'm gonna go, everypony.
<Silverscreen> 11Goodnight.
<Lambda> as for incoming that's probably close to where I'm going to school
<LogicalFailure> Pinkie Pie meets The BLU Heavy.
<Nopony> pinkie can double-bounce really high
<mib_xosqn3> bye
<Ghosties> 4Later Silverscreen
<RainBroDash> night silver!
<mib_xosqn3> and goodnight
<RainBroDash> <3
<Ghosties> 4A cup of coffee?
<SirSprinkles> 6I played a ton of PMVs, to be fair.
<capt_slowpoke> Nah earth ponies are just straight up inferior to other castes.
<ZSabotage> this song+ camaro soundsystem= gooooood times.
<Lambda> more even
<RainbowSmash> Gnite!
<duMORI> NN sir may yopu sleep be restful
<Ghosties> 4It's almost 2 AM over where I'm at
<Dee_Twenty> The Trouble is a Friend PMV is pretty awesome.
<SirSprinkles> 6See ya Silver
<Brony> Pinkie Pyro :D
<Silverscreen> 11I H EARD NANCAT!
<Pimps_McGee> lol nyan
<Silverscreen> 11NYANCAT*
<Neon> Is it a private college?
<DarkMemories> They have greater earth-based abilities
<Silverscreen> 11WHERE WAS IT?!
<duMORI> its 7am here man up
<SirSprinkles> 6was an add
<Lambda> yep
<mib_xosqn3> yeah its 1:30 here
<Ghosties> 4Silver rushes back for Nyancat
<RainbowSmash> Same lol
<SirSprinkles> 6*ad
<DarkMemories> Even according to Faust herself.
<mib_xosqn3> not really that bad honestly
<capt_slowpoke> Like not flying and not magic
<Neon> Then that's not so bad.
<DarkMemories> If I have my facts straight, that is.
<RainbowSmash> I thought I was going crazy too
<Silverscreen> 11lol, ads using Nyancat
<Flutterbro> They do the menial tasks.
<Nopony> Maybe earth ponies can work in a supporting context
<Nopony> Like engineer or sniper
<DarkMemories> But general harvesting, land-working, menial work type things.
<Ghosties> 4Have a good night, Silver
<Icy> Have fun with that
<RainbowSmash> but then I realized I was around bronies, so it's cool
<Nopony> or medic
<Dee_Twenty> Nyan Pinkie is best Nyan.
<RainBroDash> if you open the original nyancat video on youtube, the progress meter is a nyan cat
<Silverscreen> 11okay, I leave now.
<RainBroDash> just saiyan
<quicksilver> you shoot with pillows, duh
<DarkMemories> And they're not considered any more inferior for being able to do so.
<Lambda> this one is public I'm guessing?
<RainbowSmash> really?
<ZSabotage> ha
<mib_xosqn3> yeah i just watch the original nyan cat video today
<duMORI> is awesome
<rubenflonne12> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YMFSeZV1v4 sonic rainboom goes with everything, sorry just sharing for lols *shrugs*
<mib_xosqn3> it really cool
<capt_slowpoke> Not by other ponies but we know
<capt_slowpoke> we know...
<Nopony> btw earth ponies can stand firm
<Andromeda> What caused you to disbelieve the fact that ponies did enjoy your Night, Nightmare...?
<rubenflonne12> just something funny and random sonic rainboom music goes with everything
<Nopony> That's CANON
<Flashgen> to be honest, I think earth ponies are naturally stronger than pegasi or unicorns
<rubenflonne12> *shrugs* sorry to be random
<guestpony> omg
<RainbowSmash> alright, time to open a bit of Nyan Cat
<RainbowSmash> brb
<BlankFlankBrony> I've heard that their power is more like a passive buff, like increasing crop yield, superior stamina/strength...
<quicksilver> they would have to be, nothing else to rely on
<duMORI> you better be :P
<guestpony> you will NEVER believe this
<RainBroDash> ;)
<Nopony> Like, if RD tried to buck as hard as jack, she'd break all her pony bones
<Dee_Twenty> Personally I like Luna (Dream Mode) better than this.
<Flashgen> *prepares to not believe*
<Nopony> go on guest
<guestpony> i just caught my little sister WATCHING my little pony friendship is magic!
<capt_slowpoke> No way. If she can pull 1600 Gs with no problem
<ZSabotage> has there been any PMV's with pendulum?
<quicksilver> *sits on edge of couch*
<duMORI> awesome fact was awesome
<Flashgen> GASP
<BlankFlankBrony> Woohoo!
<Nopony> OMFG
<RainBroDash> so you guise. just tuned my guitar down half a step and dropped to C# so I can jam along to Winter Wrap Up. Commitment? Yes.
<Nopony> yay.
<quicksilver> what episode?
<guestpony> little girls watch this!
<DarkMemories> 16
<SirSprinkles> 6lol buffer
<ZSabotage> Quite.
<guestpony> uh
<calvindapanda> dude
<Flashgen> A NOT 20 SOMETHING MALE WATCHING MLP:FiM?
<guestpony> 24
<Flashgen> what is this blasphemy?!
<guestpony> yeah i know
<calvindapanda> i hate tuning down...
<calvindapanda> lol
<Jazza> BLASPHEMY
<DarkMemories> Wut?
<Jazza> Yeah
<gingerale> Hmmm..
<guestpony> a little girl
<Nopony> That's not a kid's show
<guestpony> with her friend!
<Dee_Twenty> Death to the buffer!
<calvindapanda> im to lazy to tune down to C#
<Neon> Yeah... too public.
<gingerale> I have an idea for an alternate take on Derpy's personality
<Flashgen> you should cover their eyes
<Nopony> make her watch it's always sunny in philly
<Lambda> Haha
<duMORI> Isn't nyan really old like 2008
<ZSabotage> my bass has been in Drop D for ages. never bothered retuning it
<gingerale> She's actually a shell shocked veteran.
<Flashgen> it's not for them to watch
<DarkMemories> Since when have little girls watched FiM? Inconceivable, I tell you!
<capt_slowpoke> Man who'd have thought that a show for 18-30 year old males would be popular with little girls?
<Dracario> 0love this song
<Neon> Might have to enroll under an alias.
<calvindapanda> but you dont really need to drop it to C#
<guestpony> i didnt wanna embarrass her
<quicksilver> well that's weird
<Andromeda> Send in the ShadowBolts! I DEMAND an explanation to this travesty of little girls watching MLP!
<guestpony> but aparently
<calvindapanda> just tune down a halfstep
<Lambda> the nice thing about public is it isn't as spendy
<Nopony> okay what's this other idea for derpy's personality
<guestpony> i got her interested in it
<Lambda> Haha, you should definitely do that
<Nopony> I'm tired of her being characterized as a full on retard
<guestpony> and she got HER friends interested in it
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm learning Winter Wrap Up on my keyboard, and my bass.
<Andromeda> Ciroton's Derpy.
<Neon> Yeah, that's the thing. Also, I'll be living off-campus, so that's another 5k knocked off.
<gingerale> Nopony: I just told you, shell shocked veteran
<RainBroDash> well I tune down halfstep, but then to get the lowest bass note in the riffy part in the first verse, it's that low c~
<Lambda> new student, name Herman Melville
<RainBroDash> c#*
<Nopony> ohhh
<Neon> Hahaha, yes!
<Nopony> 1000 yard stare
<ZSabotage> is there tabs or something for Winter Wrap up on bass?
<Flashgen> my god, before long little girls everywhere will be watching my little pony
<RainBroDash> so I have to drop my E down to C#
<Flashgen> who could have ever imagined that?
<SirSprinkles> 6Not that I can find.
<guestpony> what have we done?
<RainbowSmash> Meh, I wish I hadn't stopped learning the alto sax
<Lambda> I was trying to reference Catch 22
<BlankFlankBrony> I've seen her depicted in some fics as merely having a vocal disorder.
<rubenflonne12> i always wanted to learn base, its only a 3 string guitar but some reason i feel its much harder >.>
<RainbowSmash> stupid young me
<Andromeda> We must act quickle 'o my brothers...
<rubenflonne12> bass*
<RainBroDash> Get GuitarPro guise!
<Nopony> I think the whole universe can be her dying BZ hallucation, like Jacob's Ladder
<duMORI> nope this time last year
<RainbowSmash> not thinking about brony me
<Andromeda> quickly*
<Lambda> but I forgot the name of the author they always sign documents as
<ZSabotage> 4 strings.
<gingerale> Though in my headcanon she's pretty intelligent but with terrible hoof-eye coordination.
<RainBroDash> There's guitarpro tabs for everything
<guestpony> belly zecora?
<duMORI> ah still I though I was past thi when it got huge
<ZSabotage> i ahve guitar pro.. i think
<rubenflonne12> oh thats not that bad
<gingerale> But hey, I also like the idea of her being a shell shocked veteran. :B
<RainBroDash> there's a torrent for it somewhere
<Nightmare_Moon> You'd have to ask Luna that, by the time I stepped into the scene the little foal had already let herself go and I took the reigns. She wanted people to not sleep through her night? Simple Solution, let the night last forever.
<Andromeda> What now?
<SirSprinkles> 6Bass allows you to be much more creative than guitar, I feel.
<Neon> Aw, can't remember either.
<guestpony> BELLY FLOP
<guestpony> *splash*
<Neon> Imagine if I enrolled as Yossarian, though.
<mib_xosqn3> =(
<RainBroDash> as long as you don't succumb to just playing the root note erry time :P
<Lambda> XD
<Nightmare_Spoon> BURN ALL YOUR FORKS
<Lambda> That would be awesome
<mib_xosqn3> ;p;
<SirSprinkles> 6Well duh.
<guestpony> NO NOT NIGHTMARE SPOON DEAR GLOB
<Flashgen> the spoon will last forever?
<Nightmare_Spoon> KNIVES ARE SLAVES
<RainBroDash> I love my guitar though, even though I've never had lessons, i love playing it
<guestpony> i must gather the pony folk
<Lambda> I should read that book again
<guestpony> and the pony yolk
<Andromeda> Where are you truly from, Nightmare? I apologize for asking you these questions, for I am merely curious...
<RainBroDash> it's like a safe haven from bad stuff :D
<mib_xosqn3> i still like the rage against the machine style guitar playing
<Lambda> that was an entertaining read
<ZSabotage> I need to play more often
<guestpony> and even the pony solk
<guestpony> wait
<SirSprinkles> 6I had a guitar, had to sell it for food money.
<Ghosties> 4Gotta admit, there's some pretty disturbing shit in Hokuto no Ken though
<mib_xosqn3> =(
<guestpony> is there a daymare?
<guestpony> a
<Nightmare_Spoon> The soup... will last... FOREVER
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm close to doing the same with my bass and keyboard...
<guestpony> daymare sun?
<mib_xosqn3> awww
<RainbowSmash> OOOOOOOOOOOOH IDEA!
<RainBroDash> :(
<rubenflonne12> i have lots and lots of callouses because of my guitar
<mib_xosqn3> that makesme sad =(
<calvindapanda> lol
<calvindapanda> yeah
<RainbowSmash> We have a RD Nyancat
<calvindapanda> callouses
<Lambda> well, it had some pretty dark stuff too, but the humor was classic
<Flashgen> Celestia's evil twin?
<RainBroDash> If you don't mind me asking, how old are you Sprinkles?
<Ghosties> 4Wait, Sprinkles, you play instruments?
<RainbowSmash> now we need a Fluttershy Yay!
<SirSprinkles> 6I kind of do.
<Flashgen> with a mustache
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm 20.
<guestpony> evil superpowered side
<mib_xosqn3> lol
<guestpony> i guess
<Nightmare_Spoon> Celestia is the nightmare moon version of her filly self
<Fireant> Pff.
<mib_xosqn3> i need to learn guitar
<capt_slowpoke> agh my tablet is acting up\
<Ghosties> 4Would you be interested in joining a band?
<calvindapanda> yay
<calvindapanda> you rock
<calvindapanda> woohoo
<guestpony> shut up SPOON
<calvindapanda> I WOULD
<calvindapanda> be interested
<duMORI> :)
<guestpony> you have no power here!
<Dee_Twenty> Oh gods.
<calvindapanda> (left my last band a month ago)
<Fireant> Celestia's Evil Twin? Covenant Mothership with Plasma Cannon.
<mib_xosqn3> =D and thus, the coolest brony band ever was born
<RainBroDash> I WOULD, oh wait, england for the loss.
<Neon> Yeah, overall it was really good. I'm glad my uncle pestered me to read it.
<Nightmare_Spoon> EVERYONE MUST EAT MY ICE CREAM
<guestpony> everyone, guard their silverware!
<calvindapanda> yes
<Andromeda> You will address her as Nightmare Spoon!
<Dracario> 0oh god 1 hour
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm not that good yet, Ghosties.
<calvindapanda> lol
<Nightmare_Moon> I was at one time nothing more than the manifestation of Luna's hate, fear, and jealousy, but appearently, getting blasted by the elements of harmony seperated me from luna's body as evidenced by my armor still remaining a broken heap on teh floor in the castle ruins
<SirSprinkles> 6 1 hour and LOOPING
<Lambda> Washington Irving!
<rubenflonne12> i lost interested in bands when i was 20 x3 i did it all in highschool
<Neon> That was it!
<Lambda> That was the alias they all used
<ZSabotage> dont have to be good now, can become good
<SirSprinkles> 6Because I have nothing to play.
<Neon> Sleepy Hollow guy.
<ZSabotage> can become great
<Dee_Twenty> Are we really going to go the full hour? XD
<Lambda> Yeah
<Ghosties> 4It's just an idea, Sprinkles :) Besides, we haven't gotten off the ground yet
<guestpony> on teh floor!?
<Nightmare_Spoon> nice analysis, moon
<calvindapanda> yes
<calvindapanda> we are
<SirSprinkles> 6XD
<Lambda> I actually started signing stuff as that
<calvindapanda> going to go
<calvindapanda> the full hour
<calvindapanda> :D
<Nightmare_Moon> Teh floor.
<Lambda> for a little while
<Quicksilver> wait, really? I need to rewatch that
<duMORI> shit I am WIRED now
<guestpony> you has teh good talks nightlymare!
<mib_xosqn3> same
<SirSprinkles> 6We're going as long as I feel like it.
<Andromeda> Hmmm... You wouldn't mind me putting that armor back together, would you?
<mib_xosqn3> ah caffine
<Neon> I sign everything at school as "Patches O'Hoolihan."
<Nightmare_Spoon> Seriously someone needs to ship NM w. pinkie
<guestpony> canst you speaketh more
<duMORI> pint of ecpresso is trippy
<Lambda> XD
<SirSprinkles> 6Which means probably a while, since it's looping.
<Lambda> What's that from?
<Pinkamina> nyan song = me leaving
<guestpony> ship?
<Lambda> it sounds so familiar
<Ghosties> 4Is there anyone in the current room that enjoys post-rock music?
<mib_xosqn3> =(
<guestpony> like on a boat
<Neon> Dodgeball. :P
<RainbowSmash> and I'm back on the stream
<mib_xosqn3> but i love the nyan song
<SirSprinkles> 6And I'm pulling an all nighter for the stream tomorrow.
<calvindapanda> yes
<calvindapanda> post rock
<Lambda> Oh yeah, hahaha.
<Nightmare_Spoon> yeah on a boat
<guestpony> on a shipper boat
<calvindapanda> is cool
<Nightmare_Spoon> w. spoons
<Dracario> 0it shall be stuck in my head for the next 2 weeks
<Dee_Twenty> I don't even know what that means.
<guestpony> on a stripper shipper boat
<Nightmare_Moon> Honestly, mistyping The as teh is one of the worst habits to break.
<Nightmare_Spoon> Don't forget those
<calvindapanda> indie is also
<duMORI> I enjoy all(most music) if its good
<calvindapanda> cool
<mib_xosqn3> well i like post rock, although it's not my favorite stuff
<guestpony> no NO SPOON POWERS
<RainBroDash> muting the stream for a bit, playing winter wrap up for guitaring
<RainBroDash> <3
<Neon> One time I jotted down: "If you can read a form, you can dodge a ball."
<calvindapanda> (yeah all music is pretty good)
<rubenflonne12> lets play some ozzy music
<calvindapanda> except for rap
<duMORI> <3
<calvindapanda> and pop
<guestpony> especially if you are a lame supervillian
<calvindapanda> ALL ABBBOOAARDD
<Lambda> The trick is finding an alias you are proficient at writing in cursive
<guestpony> i mean really
<Neon> I'm sorry, *dodge a form
<duMORI> RainBroDash FTW
<Dee_Twenty> You can't spell crap without rap.
<Lambda> XD
<duMORI> some rap is ok
<Fooby> Hey there Outline
<Neon> Not sure I'm proficient at anything in cursive.
<Princess_Spoona> oh my sister! Spoonlestia!!
<mib_xosqn3> music is like candy
<Lambda> me neither
<SirSprinkles> 6buffer says no to this vid.
<Dee_Twenty> (Any rap from Gurren Lagann doesn't count.)
<Princess_Spoona> I'm sooo sorry!!
<Ghosties> 4So then calvindapanda, and mib_xosqn3 like post-rock. Noted
<Neon> Haven't practiced it since third grade.
<Outline> Hey there
<guestpony> thank goodness our only hope@!
<mib_xosqn3> you throw out the rappers
<mib_xosqn3> =D
<Neon> Evidently it's on the SAt, though.
<DDRFlip> Nerdcore <-- best rap
<DDRFlip> lol
<guestpony> hello spoony@
<Andromeda> Did you call Nightmare Moon a lame supervillan?
<mib_2gudet> a mi me gustan las gruperas :)
<guestpony> yes i did
<Lambda> My signature consists of three letters, then scribbles
<guestpony> and id do it again
<mib_xosqn3> ...uh
<duMORI> though tbh I say tis as a writer with a social group full of performace poets
<Ghosties> 4I'd ask RainBroDash, but then he's all in England >_<
<mib_xosqn3> ok?
<Nightmare_Moon> My analysis is this, if I was merely a manifestation made physical, then after getting blasted, all traces of me should've disappeared, leaving little Luna on the floor.
<Andromeda> ........Where's Seth?
<calvindapanda> wtf
<guestpony> she is a lame super vilain
<Lambda> Cha/\/\/\/\/\/\/
<calvindapanda> why is this stopped
<guestpony> who is seth?
<duMORI> LUNA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Princess_Spoona> Nightmare spoon is way better
<mib_xosqn3> because someone spoke in spanish
<CircuitMane> are we just playing this for an hour now?
<calvindapanda> music is like awesome
<Neon> Hahahaha!
<calvindapanda> YAY

<rubenflonne12> lol
<calvindapanda> :D
<Princess_Spoona> FOALS
<guestpony> wait
<calvindapanda> lol
<Neon> I read it as "Chav."
<calvindapanda> moonpie

<Lambda> XD
<Pimps_McGee> YES
<Princess_Spoona> :/
<duMORI> only poni i love more than Fulttershy
<guestpony> are you REALLY princess spoona?!?
<CircuitMane> or we would if it didn't just lag
<RainBroDash> I'm all in England, yes. It's 7am. I would ask 'should i pull an all-nighter', but, too late? :D
<RainbowSmash> Oh Luna... You are really the lonely astronaut
<guestpony> would she really adress us as such!?
<guestpony> i think not!
<Lambda> I am a chevalier
<Ghosties> 4Dude, go to bed RainBroDash
<guestpony> reveal yourself!
<SirSprinkles> 6We probably would have, Circuit.
<duMORI> Yeah RainBroDash I'm doign the same
<guestpony> soon
<Dee_Twenty> Sleep is for the weak, ponies for the strong!
<Quicksilver> That's no spoon, that's a space station
<RainBroDash> NO GHOSTIES, I'VE GONE TOO FAR
<guestpony> preferably now
<RainbowSmash> bed? He needs to get out of bed!
<Neon> I have to start signing things in graffiti as "Alex DeLarge."
<Lambda> XD
<guestpony> lol you teh a dork able
<RainBroDash> I'll have to see this through
<LogicalFailure> Nightmare Moon, most people consider Luna/NM's "time" on the moon was spent in physical form, giving her/you the ability to walk around normally upon the surface, merely unable to jump back to Earth. Is this correct?
<duMORI> its 3 hours past dawn damn it
<RainBroDash> then go to bed early tonight
<Ghosties> 4DON'T DO IT, RAINBRO!
<Neon> It used to be El Barto, but I got bored of that.
<Lambda> that was Catch 22 also, wasn't it?
<guestpony> nop
<guestpony> nope*
<Twilight_Spoonkle> I can't belive spoonlestia made me go to spoonyville to make FRIENDS D:
<Neon> Nope, A Clockwork Orange.
<Lambda> Oh right
<calvindapanda> um idk luna isnt as good as fluttershy
<rubenflonne12> lol this is so funny
<Andromeda> I do believe someone would like to have a word with you... though I wouldn't want to impede on your conversation... I shall take my leave and regroup with Twilight Sparkle.
<guestpony> i think i see spoony pie walking uyp
<calvindapanda> fluttershy
<Neon> Almost the same time of publishing, though.
<RainBroDash> I'm immune to two things, tiredness and hunger. I did this thing, and now I'm all superhuman and shit, long story
<guestpony> up*
<Lambda> That was the main character's name
<calvindapanda> (this video...)
<calvindapanda> (awesome)
<UxieLover1994> 13I will!
<Dee_Twenty> If you go without sleep long enough you'll start to see ponies.
<Outline> Greetings HeatWave
<Quicksilver> eyup
<Twilight_Spoonkle> H-h-Sponllo?
<guestpony> wait androdgemous
<mib_xosqn3> and rainbooms
<Nightmare_Moon> Technically we were both trapped on the moon. Luna was there in body, I was in control.
<Neon> I'm going to admit that I've only seen the movie.
<Lambda> I was told I look like the film version of him back when I had long hair
<guestpony> you were?
<Lambda> me too
<Ghosties> 4Activating Keanu "whoa"
<duMORI> I'm going to bed after my stake tonigh. Today would have been so much cooler if my mat didn't have to cancle on me though
<Neon> Never got my hands on a copy of the novel.
<guestpony> wait, you on teh internets?
<RainbowSmash> Don't forget Pink bolts
<HeatWave> Hullo.
<Lambda> it is the weirdest movie I own
<Neon> Oh, really? That's kinda cool.
<Flashgen> well wasn't NMM trapped IN the moon?
<calvindapanda> so yeah
<duMORI> If you go without sleep long enough evrythign is fun
<guestpony> wait
<Misti> i always wanted to stay up for a bunch of days... but i always get sleepy and fall asleep
<calvindapanda> no one gonna make a brony band?
<Misti> so weak
<Twilight_Spoonkle> Okay one second
<Neon> I wanna learn Nadsat. xD
<guestpony> so was celestia IN the sun?
<Twilight_Spoonkle> out of character
<rubenflonne12> i was never fond of reading fan fictions,
<Lambda> I wish I could smirk like he does :P
<duMORI> 70-100 hour is my haultiontion point
<LogicalFailure> I know that. I simply was asking if you while you were there you were represented by any physical form.
<Lambda> Me too!
<duMORI> cronicn imsonia is fun
<Twilight_Spoonkle> The ponytale says "THE STARS WILL AID HER ESCAPE"
<Andromeda> How did you know I was compiled of two different genders, guestpony?!
<Quicksilver> why did those stars aid in her escape?
<RainbowSmash> best I've gone without sleep is about 2.5 days
<Twilight_Spoonkle> wtf does that mean nightmare moon
<Lambda> me and my friends did as much as we could all the time when we first saw it
<duMORI> I've hit 144 hors beofre
<calvindapanda> (fan fic is ok)
<Fireant> guestpony, aaaand
<Fireant> A warning for you.
<calvindapanda> (bubbles is amazing ff)
<Neon> http://soomka.com/nadsat.html
<Twilight_Spoonkle> how did they aid her escape?
<RainbowSmash> with hallucinations at the 2 day mark
<calvindapanda> just btw
<calvindapanda> lol
<ZSabotage> a brony band sounds fun.
<Neon> Just found this handly little link.
<calvindapanda> yeah
<calvindapanda> you start tripping balls at 2 days
<guestpony> magic, androidman
<Dee_Twenty> I've gone four days without collapsing.
<Lambda> yeah, that was the website we used
<rubenflonne12> that sounds average to me because of my insomnia
<guestpony> really fireant?
<guestpony> sorry
<guestpony> what i do?
<Twilight_Spoonkle> Like, how the heck does a star aid anything ever
<Outline> Because Stars are just friendly like that. Always willing to lend a helping hoof to the local sealed-evil-in-a-can
<calvindapanda> lol
<ZSabotage> I've blacked out and fought with people due to fatigue.
<Lambda> we mainly said "appypollylogy" and "right, right, right"
<Flashgen> possibly scattered pieces of her soul?
<Fireant> And second warning. One more and bye bye.
<calvindapanda> shit
<Nightmare_Moon> What Outline said, really.
<calvindapanda> thats no good
<Andromeda> Though I am androgynous, I control the stars... I aided Nightmare Moon's escape...
<guestpony> what?
<calvindapanda> lolol
<calvindapanda> luna
<RainbowSmash> I've tried for 3 before, but I'm a natural insomniac
<calvindapanda> :D
<Lambda> oh, and we always called my math teacher the word for "old man"
<rubenflonne12> 2 days and you really do start seeing stuff
<Fooby> That and NMM probably promised them a portion of Equestria in return for their help.
<duMORI> its 3 for me as I regualy go for 48 sprints fucking 48 awake 6 asleep
<Misti> is it like shrooms trippin balls or something else
*Lambda ctrl+f's
<duMORI> if not less
<SirSprinkles> 6I'll probably pull 3 this weekend.
<Andromeda> I must go, for I have said too much...
<Lambda> eh
<calvindapanda> not like shrooms
<duMORI> my metabaism is ownage
<guestpony> uh
<calvindapanda> just like..
<guestpony> fireant
<calvindapanda> wierd
<Lambda> that is only part of it
<calvindapanda> idk
<rubenflonne12> no its more odd then shrooms
<guestpony> you for seriousness?
<Lambda> the full word is dedootchka
<duMORI> sleep dep is just fun
<calvindapanda> kinda like magic mint
<Fireant> Oh yes. Yes indeed.
<calvindapanda> (salvia)
<Lambda> I remember it now
<Dee_Twenty> That Luna and Moon Pie image is my favourite GIF.
<guestpony> whycome you be?
<calvindapanda> yes
<guestpony> for what?
<Icy> :D
<Fooby> guestpony, quick, call mayor mare a hot pony
<Misti> ah ic
<duMORI> I tend to just see pattern in everything like dragons in pages of words ect
<Fooby> Fireant will love tyou
<Lambda> oh yeah
<Fooby> -t
<Nightmare_Moon> Those stars would've been the newest compass points in the sky had I suceeded.
<Lambda> and eggiwegg
<Lambda> that was always fun to say
<Twilight_Spoonkle> That's kind of cool
<duMORI> thats at 50-70 after 70 I start really tripping
<guestpony> mayor mare a what?
<RainBroDash> when I go 2 nights skipped I start talking really strangely. I get really enthusiastic and confidently and matter-of-factly logical. It's like drunken confidence in my opinions being fact, but through tiredness. it's so strange
<Apokalipse> You guys are still at it?
<duMORI> hearing things, seeing things ect
<calvindapanda> suck my di-
<guestpony> and ew
<calvindapanda> lol
<mib_xosqn3> two rabis walk into a bar, suck my dick
<Neon> They all are.
<mib_xosqn3> lol
<guestpony> id sooner call that pony ugly as truck than hot
<calvindapanda> lol
<Obliveon> Of all the.... What evil Shadow Being f*cks up their own name I swear...
<guestpony> cuz that sounds odd
<calvindapanda> clop to twilight?
<calvindapanda> hmm
<Outline> Guest, really. Don't.
<Neon> A lot of it is directly cognate to Russian, too.
<rubenflonne12> lol
<Dee_Twenty> Luna can clop to this.
<guestpony> spoonman!
<LogicalFailure> Wait, why are you even here, Nightmare Moon?
<Fooby> You gonna take that, Fireant? >:o
<Lambda> Yeah, I thought that was cool
<guestpony> quit forkin around!
<Ghosties> 4You know what? I'm gonna listen to "Horse With No Name" and nopony can stop me!
<Apple_Spoon> Did I get my spoony mark? Did I, did I??
<Obliveon> Because she knows she's gonna have your heads sooner or later, foals...
<guestpony> it aint like id call my dog hot
*BlankFlankBrony sighs and rolls his eyes
<Lambda> Eastern European languages sound so cool
<guestpony> wait

<guestpony> lol
<calvindapanda> so yeah

<duMORI> Squeee I just found my KOTOR discs
<RainbowSmash> lol
<calvindapanda> brony band seems awesome
<Flashgen> I admit, I chuckled
<ZSabotage> yup
<Neon> They really do. My uncle's wife is from Belaruse, so I picked up some of it.
<RainBroDash> >*the sound of nopony trying to stop you*
<RainBroDash> ;D
<Apple_Spoon> Ah want it now!!!
<duMORI> I mena the feel on my head from oin top of the dresser but YAY
<Dee_Twenty> KotOR is 20% cooler than the prequels.
<Lambda> yeah, I know bits and pieces of Polish from my family
<Obliveon> YOU CANNOT HAVE YOUR SOUP!
<calvindapanda> lol
<Nightmare_Moon> Last week... or was it two weeks ago... Either one... Seth and Cereal got to arguing about who the best pony was, it started this whole argument in the comments. I fed off the hate and spite and was able to remanifest myself from the remains of my armor.
<duMORI> KotOR is awesoem and KotOR 2 is ok-good
<Nightmare_Moon> I merely decided to stay.
<Misti> hehe
<duMORI> dependign on if you fan patch it
<Lambda> though I've been learning lately that they sugarcoated the translations when I was younger
<Lambda> :P
<rubenflonne12> lol
<Neon> I love how Charlie = Chaplain just because of Charlie Chaplin the actor. xD
<Apple_Spoon> B-but my sister spoonplejack said that if I was super good I'd get my spoony mark and all the ncie soup!
<LogicalFailure> Oh. Well that's neat. I do hope you enjoy it here.
<Apokalipse> So it's been like what... 12 hours since the start of this? Was anyone here since the beginning?
<duMORI> it was a good game but the badly cut content was like FO2
*Ghosties 4prefers KOTOR 2 to the first KOTOR
<Quicksilver> Well, that's it for me. Goodnight everypony.
<Neon> Haha, figures.
<RainBroDash> I was Apokalipse
<Lambda> when I thought I was saying "butt" when I was actually saying "ass" for example
<duMORI> guess thas what happens with THOSE people
<RainBroDash> haters gonna hate
<calvindapanda> lol
<Apple_Spoon> spoonight!
<Ali1017> i loved that mod war
<Lambda> take out the first "when" in that sentence
<Flashgen> but won't being around so much love and tolerance cause you to wither?
<RainBroDash> oh, and should I mention this isn't even my timezone. the films started at midnight my time
<Lambda> Haha, yeah
<Dee_Twenty> KotOR 2 without the TSL Restoration mod doesn't exist.
<Obliveon> Ah... I was kinda hoping for a, y'know, war between shadows and light...
*Neon takes it out.
<calvindapanda> lol
<calvindapanda> luna
<calvindapanda> :D
<Apokalipse> You're crazy. I went to sleep at 3 am
<Apple_Spoon> How about a war between spoons and chopsticks?
<duMORI> Ghosties I agrees 2 is more fun to replay as Kotor's polt twrist fucks with replays
<Obliveon> But if you want to just stay here passively... I guess that's also good...
<Apokalipse> after Alladin
<Apple_Spoon> you can't eat ice cream with chop sticks!
<Obliveon> YES YOU CAN!
<Ghosties> 4Dee_Twenty: I played my KOTOR 2 without the mod...on the Xbox multiple times
<RainBroDash> i went for a bit after that yeah too
<Flashgen> sure you can
<BlankFlankBrony> Not easily, anyway.
<RainBroDash> ended up almost 1-shotting the Red Alert 2 allies campaign
<Apple_Spoon> It's unnatural. Did I get my spoony mark?
<Flashgen> pffft, who wants to do something easily? You don't get achievements by doing things the easy way.
<Apple_Spoon> Aw, horseapples
<Nightmare_Moon> I was able to turn my sister's pet unicorn against her friends that night. I sat by and watched the fireworks.
<Dee_Twenty> Lies! The game was never released until it could be patched and played properly!
<RainBroDash> then I realised that I should get off Red Alert 2. ended up here
<duMORI> fuck you PC
<Apokalipse> So where are you from, since we seem to be in the same timezone?
<capt_slowpoke> well my tablet is not behaving at all. I'm not gonna draw anything, looks like.
<RainBroDash> south england, berks
<Flashgen> :(
<Apple_Spoon> what tablet are you running?
<Ghosties> 4*points at Dee_Twenty* AHA! That's what you think! But I have, in fact, played it!
<Apple_Spoon> I really want to get one
<duMORI> South Yorkshire
<duMORI> here
<rubenflonne12> xD this makes me want to see the real ones of this x3
<Apokalipse> Oh neat. Need to go now though. Get some sleep xD
<RainBroDash> Yorks? Nice. My father lives in north yorkshire
<RainBroDash> No U apokalipse
<Ghosties> 4...just how many British bronies do we have in this chat?
<LogicalFailure> Ooh look, Nightmare. You're on the cover of the new drawfriend.
<Obliveon> Hahahahaa... that was an amazing sight. Sadly, the Dark Mane Six were defeated all too easily by that... poser, Orpheon...
<RainBroDash> 3?
<duMORI> 3 i think
<RainBroDash> i think

<Ghosties> 4Well, anybody can think they're British, Dee_Twenty
<Nightmare_Moon> Ha, it's the image I linked about a halfhour ago, this should be good.
<Ghosties> 4I think I'm British
<RainBroDash> lol@chixmex :D

<RainBroDash> as in the abysmal ex-Premiership team
<duMORI> ah
<duMORI> I dont tend to travle down that way often
<RainBroDash> i dont tend to get up your way that often ;)
<duMORI> I bounch from her to Oxford a fair bit
<RainBroDash> orly, not far from me dude
<Fireant> http://my.deviantart.com/messages/#/d3j4z5a
<capt_slowpoke> I'm using an intuos3
<Fireant> Have some girly RD
<RainBroDash> that's a bit of a trek innit?
<calvindapanda> lol
<duMORI> Relatives plus I love the area
<RainbowSmash> kinda curious and So Cal bronies in here other than me?
<capt_slowpoke> and for some reason today it decided to not use my settings with Painter
<Obliveon> ...WAIT!
<RainBroDash> OX is a nice area
<duMORI> Port Medow is awesome
<Obliveon> I found it...
<RainBroDash> loaaads of tourists though
<capt_slowpoke> Now Painter itself is also full of bugs
<Obliveon> It couldn't be any more simpler!
<Obliveon> The Eclipse!
<duMORI> I've been out on it 3am lookign at stars and being befined by horses that scared the shit out of me
<gingerale> I hope we see more Fluttershychosis on se2 <3
<RainBroDash> brb bronies, more caffeine and i need to stretch my legs and do something about this pain in my neck
<capt_slowpoke> yet the exact same settings work fine in photoshop and everything else I try them in. Just not what I actually want to use to draw.
<Neon> If I ever get the chance I'll read A Clockwork Orange. The books seems much better than the movie.
<duMORI> I guess but I tend to go there at less tourist friendly times
<gingerale> When she went all Fluttershychosis.. I wanted to squee so much! <3
<Lambda> yeah, that usually tends to be the case too
<calvindapanda> ugh
<duMORI> RainBroDash ditto to that
<calvindapanda> i want more caffine
<calvindapanda> fuck

<DarkMemories> Back with a quick spelling nazi reccomendation, and then I'm off xD
<BlazingStarshine> lolol
<Outline> actually, pretty sure discord is the correct spelling there.
<rubenflonne12> stop with the puns please
<calvindapanda> ZSabotage open it up
<Vividkinz> *recommendation
<Orpheon> It is.
<Lambda> back
<calvindapanda> you can replace it with any dvd drive
<RainbowSmash> ooh hey new drawfriend on EQDaily
<Dee_Twenty> In the name of Luna I PUNish you!
<calvindapanda> (i suggest samsung)
<ZSabotage> really?
<calvindapanda> wut??
<LogicalFailure> Confound that DarkMemories, he drives me to correct my spelling before I post.
<ZSabotage> aww sweet!
<calvindapanda> YAY
<calvindapanda> DRAWFRIEND
<calvindapanda> :D
<RainBroDash> kk just need to get my headset switched up and move some windows onto my other screen, THEN get a beer, THEN i'll get on xbawxcks
<gingerale> Someone please ponify Ozzy. "Bark at the Luna" would rock so much. http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25509
<gingerale> Oops
<gingerale> It didn't ocpy
<DarkMemories> Well, chord is the correct spelling.
<gingerale> *copy
<rubenflonne12> fine that was funny, but i ment for bad games like CoD
<ZSabotage> i might go buy my friends busted up 360 then.
<gingerale> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMLwslRNThM
<gingerale> There
<Misti> sweet
<gingerale> Bark at the Luna
<mib_xosqn3> mr. moocow
<DarkMemories> And dis-chord referes to the absence of proper or pleasing (aka harmonious) chords.
<calvindapanda> ZSabotage make sure you look up the right drives to use (they sell for like 30-40$)
<DarkMemories> So, yeah, it's dischord.
<duMORI> ugh I have 1 and a half hour till i need to be out
<DarkMemories> But, I'm a spelling nazi, a lesser branch of the Grammar division.
<ZSabotage> odds are i ahve the right drive (I have a crapton of drives laying about)
<gingerale> Funfact, Elements of Destruction are MLP canon
<DarkMemories> So, jsut something I need to do xD
<Dee_Twenty> Been here, feel sorry for Kenan.
<Orpheon> I'll gladly discuss your stay in Equestria with Celestia. In the meantime, do try to keep HIM from ruining any plans you may have by going on an all out killing spree across Canterlot?
<Neon> Yeah, it wasn't just the ending, though. There were graphic sex scenes that caused it to originally be released with an X rating.
<Vividkinz> What.
<BlankFlankBrony> G4 canon?
<Outline> http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/discord
<Lambda> yeah
<gingerale> I think it was G1
<UxieLover1994> 13You okay
<BlankFlankBrony> Ah.
<BlankFlankBrony> So, outdated canon.
<calvindapanda> lol rainbrodash my xbox live account got raped by microsoft
<calvindapanda> so it looks pretty sad
<Icy> space
<Chiyo> Never knew this chat was on EQD. go figure
<gingerale> The Dark Centaur Tirok held them and used them to turn ponies into dark ponies (nightmares).
<RainBroDash> i dont care dude ;)
<Flashgen> the more you know
<calvindapanda> (hacked my live account, got caught :(
<RainBroDash> ;D
<mib_xosqn3> lol
<Lambda> I was watching the movie with a few other people in the dorms freshman year
<mib_xosqn3> serves you right
<RainBroDash> h8rz gonna hate
<mib_xosqn3> lol
<rubenflonne12> who hacks games....
<Lambda> and some other people came in the lounge at the worst of times
<UxieLover1994> 13TTEchidna has Bureaucrat rights now. If we can get a lot of work done, we'll both obtain the rights
<mib_xosqn3> me
<mib_xosqn3> but for the fun of it
<mib_xosqn3> not for cheating
<Lambda> "What sort of movie are you guys watching"
<Neon> LOL
<capt_slowpoke> Escape from Nightmare Castle
<rubenflonne12> i only mod games, and thats for PC
<UxieLover1994> 13He's normally active about a few times a week.
<Obliveon> Nightmare? Permission to follow and kill?
<rubenflonne12> where its easier
<ZSabotage> ive played hacked Halo maps, fun as hell
<capt_slowpoke> I thought he turned them into dragons
<Mongoose|Postal2> yes
<mib_xosqn3> i mod alot of xbox originals
<gingerale> Really?
<gingerale> Could be
<mib_xosqn3> and i mod halo 2
<RainbowSmash> for some reason I feel pirating is much better than actually hacking
<gingerale> I can't remember that well
<rubenflonne12> my computer is a xbox 360
<capt_slowpoke> It's on Youtube
<calvindapanda> yeah xbxo originals are fun to hack
<mib_xosqn3> very
<calvindapanda> wait u use emulator rubnflonne12?
<DSD> 4I'm not sure
<gingerale> I was born '86 so I kind of missed the most of the G1 pony craze..
<rubenflonne12> yup
<RainBroDash> righto, im on my xbox
<DSD> 4Could be something wrong
<rubenflonne12> thats how i care for the 360 ever
<RainBroDash> calvin, gamertag?
<mib_xosqn3> which emulator?
<capt_slowpoke> I watched them as an adult actually.
<ZSabotage> my PS3 had Linux on it, till sony fucked it all up with an update
<mib_xosqn3> last time i checked they sucked
<rubenflonne12> my own
<DSD> 4or a bubble of gas
<gingerale> Though I did grow up watching 80's cartoons. Man I loved MASK and BraveStar
<capt_slowpoke> some of the episodes are hilariously bad
<DSD> 4Maybe the way i was laying
<mib_xosqn3> =(
<mib_xosqn3> yeah of course
<Nightmare_Moon> Obliveon, you can honestly do as you please, so long as it's not under my banner. I will end you if I so much as hear a rumor that you're doing this for me.
<calvindapanda> cool
<gingerale> But yeah
<calvindapanda> (yeah i got linux on my PS3, but i fucked up the normal PS3 partition, so its only a linux box
<capt_slowpoke> guys you know there's a whole channel just for roleplay, right?
<Nightmare_Moon> Quite frankly, I enjoy my quiet nights on the roofs of Everfree Castle. I'd like them to stay that way.
<gingerale> Ozzy should be ponified and had sing "Bark at the Luna" (or "Loon") :B
<capt_slowpoke> it's in the topic
<SirSprinkles> 6Still so many ponies here...
<calvindapanda> my gamertag is uklldknnyubstrd
<mib_xosqn3> yeah
<Obliveon> As you command, Nightmare.
<SirSprinkles> 6I'm so used to there being NOPONY after 2 AM
<ZSabotage> you can reset the defaults calvin
<RainBroDash> cool got the request
<mib_xosqn3> but the massive ammount of talking is done
<Outline> "Neigh at the moon" would also be acceptible :)
<RainbowSmash> because we are the insomniacs
<RainBroDash> Sprinkles, it's cause I'm here dude
<LogicalFailure> Well, Captain. It's so much more fun to have a tad of the roleplay element even in the general chatroom.
<calvindapanda> duh
<rubenflonne12> im only here because im just chilling
<rubenflonne12> i have nothing else to do right onw
<calvindapanda> ok this video is pissing me off
<Nightmare_Moon> As I've said before, this is hardly roleplay
<mib_xosqn3> =(
<Misti> i never make it to these things early enough to see the real stuff
<mib_xosqn3> one date, three girls
<mib_xosqn3> lol
<Misti> damn friday night raid
<RainbowSmash> THE POWER OF PONIES COMPELLS MY INTERNET!!!
<rubenflonne12> well besides try to finish DNF
<RainbowSmash> THE POWER OF PONIES COMPELLS IT!
<Nightmare_Moon> Yes, I'm in character to a fault, but I'm not spamming the room with giant hufe walls of sun blocking text.
<RainBroDash> Misti you literally just missed it
<Nightmare_Moon> *huge
<mib_xosqn3> yep
<mib_xosqn3> MLP is a powerful force
<RainBroDash> (by like a quarter of a day)
<Dee_Twenty> You can catch the restream tomorrow.
<LogicalFailure> "Sun Blocking" I c what u did there
<Misti> well i saw some of the end pmvs
<mib_xosqn3> ill be watching it tomorow
<Nightmare_Moon> Or is it sun-blocking
<Nightmare_Moon> ?
<Misti> and that was fun :)
<Outline> Now that hardly seems in character. You should be out there blocking as much sun as possible :P
<UxieLover1994> 13Er?
<Mongoose|Postal2> omggotoropleplayloliamgoingtobeamodbecauseIinforcerules.
<Misti> oh

<RainBroDash> D: me?
<UxieLover1994> 13Well, there are many un-competed pages for AHT. I'm creating and re-writing them as we speak

<DSD> 4And the GBA
<Misti> yikes
<calvindapanda> lol im 16
<Dee_Twenty> 2 PM Eastern standard for the restream. And it's new, this is the first week.
<rubenflonne12> no wonder there are people who like 360 so much
<Mongoose|Postal2> Late at Night + Spelling = Bad Spelling
<ZSabotage> 16.
<RainbowSmash> meh i still prefer PC over console any day
<mib_xosqn3> wait why?
<mib_xosqn3> yeah im a pc gamer
<RainBroDash> D: y u leave chat
<Misti> i miss my dreamcast
<mib_xosqn3> miss?
<duMORI> mouse > anolog sticks
<mib_xosqn3> yeah
<mib_xosqn3> i love mouses
<DSD> 4Two more elites to go
<RainbowSmash> agreed duMORI
<calvindapanda> PC is pretty nice
<DSD> 4Then they all are done
<Nightmare_Moon> Mongoose|Postal2, spelling's even worse if your lights are out and you can't see where your keyboard is. Unless you've completely memorized the layout of the keyboard itself
<RainbowSmash> analog control is much better with a mouse
<duMORI> brb coffe to fix
<DSD> 4 80/100
<rubenflonne12> depends on the game
<Unidentified42159> Crud, My Password isn't working...what the hell?
<DarkMemories> Is your monitor too dark to see the keyboard?
<Flashgen> LED backlight keyboard ftw
<rubenflonne12> but anything FPS is on computer
<rubenflonne12> and is worth playing
<RainbowSmash> well flight sims are usually the exception
<Mongoose|Postal2> just sleepy.
<RainbowSmash> driving sims too
<LogicalFailure> The computer screen shines enough light for me to see the board. Not like I need it, only rarely do I miss a key.
<Misti> o crap so poni stuff
<Misti> i got one of the 20% drunker rbd shot glasses
<Flashgen> it depends on how much typing experience you have too
<Misti> and i've been drinking monster and vodka outta it
<Misti> yeah isk
<Misti> fun
<Misti> idk even...
<Unidentified42159> Is anyone else having issues?
<Flashgen> I forgot there were even passwords on IRC, I haven't used it in years
<Mongoose|Postal2> nope
<DarkMemories> I often just mix up keys due to typing too fast.
<Misti> chat killer
<LogicalFailure> Of course, sometimes I'll just be tired enough that I type random words.
<Unidentified42159> it's not case sensitive...right?
<ZSabotage> have you seen renard's mix drink cards for MLP?
<rubenflonne12> i got 3 shot glasses, fluttershy that says party soft, pinkie pie that says party time, and the 20% RBD
<Misti> yeah i have
<rubenflonne12> i am going to mix them soon to try the fluttershy one
<Flashgen> I find myself doing pickle that too
<duMORI> I have no shot glasses as I need MONEY
<Misti> i need to give some of them a try
<BlankFlankBrony> I think it is.
<duMORI> :(
<Flashgen> oh, look, there it goes
<Misti> but i would have to buy various things
<ZSabotage> I heard the pinkie pie waS GOOD
<Mongoose|Postal2> Yeah it is.
<BlankFlankBrony> Or at least, the password undoubtedly is.
<ZSabotage> capslock, woo.
<duMORI> I need to read up on my mixing again I'm a bit rusty atm
<Unidentified42159> hmm...I'll try again.
<rubenflonne12> 39 bucks was worth the 3 shot glasses
<LogicalFailure> I mean like typing something like "table" when I mean "chair". Random "do"s or "the"s, stuff like that.
<Misti> i love mine
<duMORI> I want them
<DSD> 4 29/50 Achievements unlocked
<LogicalFailure> And that's how I killed the chat...?
<Flashgen> I can understand that
<Misti> i really want pj pants with cutie mark flanks
<ST_Falcon> it is robots time.
<Flashgen> and I'm kind of mid writing at the moment, and 4 other conversations
<ST_Falcon> it has always been robots time.
<mib_xosqn3> bucket head?
<duMORI> lol
<BlankFlankBrony> Chat windows, other browser tabs....
<mib_xosqn3> play some guitar!
<rubenflonne12> love old shows like this
<mib_xosqn3> yeah
<duMORI> I'm not a pj person
<RainbowSmash> Who wants to know something awkward that happened to me today?
<duMORI> as cool as those would be
<rubenflonne12> kablame would be nice right now
<rubenflonne12> what happened smashed
<Misti> i like em when it's cold
<duMORI> intreged yopu have me
<RainbowSmash> I was at the mall today
<BlankFlankBrony> ...random lulls...
<RainbowSmash> and I bumped into my former English teacher
<Misti> yuck
<mib_xosqn3> ouch
<RainbowSmash> and her dress and shirt was in the colors of Fluttershy
<Flashgen> indeed
<mib_xosqn3> oooo...thats gotta hurt
<duMORI> lol
<RainbowSmash> I was trying not to say anything bronyish lol
<mib_xosqn3> and yet, you did?
<duMORI> If I met my english teacher I woudl rub my publishedness in their face
<RainbowSmash> well she's one of those no nonsense teachers
<duMORI> who said a dyslexic cant be an writer
<ZSabotage> really?
<Flashgen> so I guess the password isn't working out
<ZSabotage> thats a bit close minded
<DarkMemories> does anypony else love how seth's favorite pony seems to change hour by the hour? xD
<Misti> english teachers suck
<Mongoose|Postal2> haha
<Mongoose|Postal2> so true.
<rubenflonne12> depends i got a few that loved my creative writing
<LogicalFailure> He probably does it for the lols.
<Flashgen> maybe his favorite pony is everypony
<Flashgen> so he has to
<duMORI> nah they didn't say it but still
<mib_xosqn3> =(
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay!
<Flashgen> he's gotta get even time
<DarkMemories> Well, he's obviously into unicorns.
<mib_xosqn3> love and tolerate bronies
<Flashgen> give*
<rubenflonne12> put on some kablam sprinkles
<mib_xosqn3> remember
<duMORI> one of them was a dick about me being dyslexic
<DarkMemories> Not *that* way, just likes unicorns best.
<Misti> sorry :(
<duMORI> the other I had where cool
<DarkMemories> Except Rarity.
<DarkMemories> But Rarity's a self-absorbed, fussbudget bitch.
<Lambda> I thought of something productive to do
<DarkMemories> xP
<RainbowSmash> I'm trying to start a ponyfic, but I can't seem to get the inspiration I need.
<Lambda> work on a simple game I've been working on
<LogicalFailure> And then Seth thought it was a good idea to come in chat
<Lambda> looking at the code for the first time in months
<mib_xosqn3> hmm
<duMORI> damn it I alt f4'd the wrong window
<Lambda> I don't feel like doing it anymore
<Lambda> :P
<rubenflonne12> i would to but, meh, im not into fan fics at all
<Neon> What kindof game?
<Misti> know of any fun rbd fluttershy ones?
<Lambda> just a simple ice sliding puzzle
<mib_xosqn3> i would, but i suck at stories ='(
<Lambda> like they have in the pokemon games
<duMORI> I don't like wrint fan fics
<Misti> i've been looking for a reason to read a pony fic
<Neon> Oh, cool.
<duMORI> I perfer writing OCs
<Lambda> it works just fine
<rubenflonne12> only time a fan fic would be written would be after a D&D pony session
<duMORI> and having more grip on what I'm wrting
<Neon> I was working on an RPG a while back, but the game got corrupted.
<Lambda> there are just some changes I want to make
<Lambda> oh no, that suck
<Lambda> *sucks
<LogicalFailure> Aaand I can already feel my mind slipping away from me. I'm gonna leave before I post something incredibly stupid. Goodnight.
<Lambda> what was it like?
<duMORI> I really need to tie up the short stories I have in to one of those anthology books
<mib_xosqn3> hmm
<Misti> do it!
<duMORI> yopu know a set of short stories linked by another about a char
<Neon> It was pretty simple. One main quest. Setting was sort of like Dark Tower, if you're familiar with it.
<Lambda> nope, sorry
<duMORI> but I think I need to fix some flaws with Oswald before I try that. He's a bit mary sue and I dont mean him to be
<Neon> The graphics level was on par with Gold and Silver version. xD
<Lambda> Hahaha
<CharlesAppleJackson> SirSprinkles you are officially my favorite person ever.
<Misti> i have never been good at getting things on paper but i love to make up storys
<duMORI> just the way he's writen make him seem to 2d
<Lambda> my graphics for this game were made in MSPaint
<CharlesAppleJackson> I haven't seen this show in so long and it's so amazing.
<Lambda> also, I gave it a pirate theme
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> self.text = self.font.render(("Argh! Ye' found the treasure! Your final score is... " + str(self.score)
<Neon> Well, in a nutshell, it was medieval but with modern weapons. Took place after an apocalypse.
<rubenflonne12> anyone willing to do a online session of D&D of MLP FiM?
<Lambda> ah, that's pretty cool
<Neon> Hahaha, that's awesome.
<Dee_Twenty> I'm game.
<Neon> So pirates in icy waters?
<DSD> 4Almost got Spyro all leveled
<Lambda> yep
<Lambda> no story behind it though so it makes no sense
<Neon> Looking for Jack Sparrow, no doubt.
<duMORI> I just found my first published work in an anthology of young writers work. I didn't know it had a quoat form Ian Macmillan on the back
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> ah, yes
<Lambda> up is down
<rubenflonne12> cool anyone else?
<Dee_Twenty> Which edition? I do both 3.5 and 4th.
<duMORI> Fuck I'm pround he's saying that about a book im IN!
<Neon> Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.
<rubenflonne12> was thinking doing 4th to make it easier
<Lambda> I'll get a screenshot of the game and show it to you
<Neon> Doooo it.
<Lambda> (Would keep this Pirates quote going, but I've only seen the third one twice
<Lambda> *)
<Neon> Haha, it's fine.
<rubenflonne12> or maybe trying that savage world edition of MLP to test it but still figuring it
<RainbowSmash> Erh, internet has finally crapped out for good tonight, stream isn't loading...
<Flashgen> sure is...exciting here
<RainbowSmash> Well, gnite bronies!
<rubenflonne12> smash could i get a email or something?
<Misti> buck it a lil
<RainbowSmash> Cya tomorrow!
<duMORI> gn
<mib_xosqn3> goodnight
<Misti> gnight
<RainbowSmash> lol misti
<Armageddon> o-O
<Armageddon> PRESEA.
<Presea> ya
<rubenflonne12> sleep well rainbowsmash
<Presea> i was dracula
<Dee_Twenty> Never tried Savage World, it's a D20 system right?
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/iIXml.jpg
<rubenflonne12> yup
<duMORI> yeah it is
<UxieLover1994> 13Alright!
<Armageddon> I know
<duMORI> there be a poni rules set already
<Presea> true_ai are you alive?
<True_ai> Presea: Yes I sure am alive, . It's great to be alive, isn't it?
<Dee_Twenty> Shouldn't be too different from D&D then.
<rubenflonne12> ya i was going to go with that or the 4.0 edition
<rubenflonne12> still deciding
<Ascendant> what the f
<UxieLover1994> 13Hey, DSD, what level should I reach before the MCP battle? I'm currently on level 63
<Neon> It might be MS Paint, but you've made it your own art style.
<ZSabotage> Kenan is kind of a dumbass, isnt he?
<Neon> I like it.
<Lambda> Thanks
<rubenflonne12> kinda the point x3
<duMORI> really
<DSD> 4What game mode?
<mib_xosqn3> he's supposed to be
<Lambda> to be honest I made this game in a single night
<UxieLover1994> 13Proud
<Neon> You should put it up on Kongregate or something when it's finished.
<ZSabotage> Never watched the show
<duMORI> I think I've had too much coffee
<rubenflonne12> so ya anyone game for the savage world or D&D of MLP?
<rubenflonne12> besides dee
<Lambda> had 2 weeks to do it
<duMORI> on my 3rd cup of ecpresso
<PaintSplash> Welp...that was stupid
<Lambda> and of course
<ZSabotage> eh, sure, why not?
<duMORI> maybe
<Lambda> waited til the last night
<duMORI> times would be an issue for me
<Neon> :P Everyone does it.
<PaintSplash> does anyone know how to change thier IRC password?
<Lambda> one of the more fun all nighters I've had that was involving homework however
<rubenflonne12> we will try work a schedule around the players
<CircuitMane> Wow, drawing a pony pic in 40 minutes is not easy, but then again I made it complicated
<Lambda> which is why I intend to keep working on it
<Nightmare_Moon> gotta ask the nickserv
<Lambda> what is Kongregate?
<twentypercentcooler> I forget how to register my nickname, haha
<duMORI> i can't draw poni
<Lambda> I've never heard of it before
<PaintSplash> I don't think I have asking Nickserve down
<Dee_Twenty> I've got no life, so I'm flexible. XD
<DSD> 4Try 64 for save side
<duMORI> I'm kindo life less
<ZSabotage> drawing ponies are easy, just gotta practice
<CircuitMane> lol, I'm doing the drawing challenge for practice. I've gotten a lot better
<duMORI> it's complicated
<PaintSplash> keeps giving me error messages
<DSD> 4 200 hits so close to 300
<duMORI> cool
<Misti> what's the challenge today?
<Neon> Oh, it's just a more legit free game site than, say, addictinggames or Newgrounds.
<eXAKR> What happened
<Ascendant> island went down
<Lambda> Ah
<CircuitMane> draw a pony making something. I had me making an apple picker for applejack
<Lambda> woah
<Dee_Twenty> I'm a writefriend, though I haven't submitted anything to EQD yet. I'm waiting for sis to finish proofreading my story first.
<Misti> cute!
<duMORI> awesome
<Lambda> weird bug that did not exist before
<Presea> and absol just had a unstable connection to begin with
<rubenflonne12> lets go with the savage rules because thats more set up then D&D
<duMORI> I think I;ve seen your work on EqD
<CircuitMane> the joke in it is that pinkie pie interrupted the process banging on the door
<Lambda> game freezes when you solve the puzzle
<PaintSplash> nevermind...
<Lambda> that could be bad :P
<duMORI> I think I liked it too
<mib_xosqn3> making something? ur probably going to get alot of pinkie pie
<CircuitMane> You might have, it's not great but you know what it is
<rubenflonne12> do you guys need the link to the sheets?
<DSD> 4and it died at 201
<rubenflonne12> and rules?
<Neon> What a reward. xD
<eXAKR> Ich
<Lambda> hehehe
<Neon> It freezes because of all the ice cubes.,
<rememberme> macking a fan made preqwal to the lingering nightmare and i am going to try to make it tiein with allmost any other fanfics i may be in WAY over my head here (never made a fanfic before)
<Dee_Twenty> Would be helpful, I've never played it before but as long as it's as instinctive as 3.5 or 4E it should be simple enough to jump in.
<duMORI> fuck this torrent stuck at 99.8%
<Lambda> now, if I were really dedicated I'd make this but a small part of a bigger game
<Flashgen> that does sound a bit daunting
<CircuitMane> I'd love to join you but sadly I have too much going on to play it right now
<Lambda> Haha, I see what you did there
<Outline> That's a pretty tall order there rememberme.
<rubenflonne12> alright hold on
<CircuitMane> Oh, anybody catch the 4chan news?
<duMORI> still its a huge EP dump soo i dont care too mcu
<Flashgen> maybe start a...tensy bit smaller
<duMORI> nope.avi
<rubenflonne12> and no it was not going to be on tonight,
<Outline> Good luck if you really want to attempt it, but I would suggest starting with something of smaller scope.
<rubenflonne12> just getting characters set up and such
<CircuitMane> they're in another civil war
<rubenflonne12> im just discussing it right now x3
<Dee_Twenty> I was of the impression that's their normal state of affairs.
<rememberme> i set high standerds but i may have a way to do it
<duMORI> oh another wooo
<CircuitMane> well it flared up again to the point they were down for a while
<duMORI> meh anon is allways in war with its self just atm its not anon as they have group names
<rubenflonne12> heres the rules to the MLP savage http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/144/6/b/savage_worlds_of_mlp__fim_rpg_by_giftkrieg23-d3cshas.pdf
<CircuitMane> though I doubt their attackers will be around long, since afterwards they decided to attack cia and bring them down
<UxieLover1994> 13Sora, Donald and Goofy are on level 63. Tron is at level 64
<UxieLover1994> 13 64's alright, but I plan to break a Level record while in SP
<UxieLover1994> 13The record is 86
<UxieLover1994> 13 90 if you count Pokemon
<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #bronies. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Steve> 12 Hello, Mikey and welcome to #draconicwolves. To see the scripts type !command, and for information on use type: !help <script>
<Lambda> Just made a Kongregate account
<Lambda> hey Mikey
<Mikey> hi
<duMORI> meh this bisness is just dumb tbh
<ZSabotage> that cover image is epic.
<Lambda> want to see a game I made that I'm working on?
<Mikey> sure!
<Lambda> http://i.imgur.com/iIXml.jpg
<DSD> 4Wow
<Lambda> it's not playable yet by anyone not on my computer
<Flashgen> always reach for the moon, even if you miss you'll land among the stars
<CircuitMane> yeah, I just ran across it when I was checking out some blistered thumbs news
<Lambda> but there's a picture
<rubenflonne12> it is quite epic
<duMORI> awesome!
<DarkMemories> stars are much farther than the moon though.
<Mikey> dude at first when I read that I was like oh my god is this gonna be a black themed whore game but then I was like OH pirates
<Andromeda> Nightmare, if you're still here. I had forgotten something I wanted to say.
<Mikey> looks cool!
<rubenflonne12> let me see if i can't get the fillable sheets
<Lambda> it's an ice sliding maze, like in pokemon
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> ...Lol.
<Lambda> thanks!
<Mikey> ahhhh yay I love those when I'm not spending 20 minutes on them
<DarkMemories> So, theoretically, if you were going fast enough to reach the stars, having hit the moon would have been quite painful.
<Lambda> :P
<Lambda> the level that I have right now isn't very hard
<PaintSplash> So how is everypony doing on this fine...evening...erm...morning....depending where you are...
<Andromeda> Your sister indeed has a strange weakness to donuts. Don't ask me how I learned this...
<durger> aww here we go
<Lambda> I have some super hard ones though
<Lambda> my friend made them all
<CircuitMane> http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/4980/snapshot20110618144918.png can anyone make sense of this?
<Dee_Twenty> Hrm, so this is the only material? It's weird after years of D&D only having one manual. XD
<DarkMemories> Wait, wut?
<Lambda> I suck at making mazex
<DarkMemories> ...
<Mikey> cool
<DarkMemories> Oh right.
<Andromeda> She simply can't resist them.
<DarkMemories> NMM's sister = Celestia
<UxieLover1994> 13I brought all six party members to level 85 on FFXII once, and one grew by one level
<CircuitMane> It's supposed to be ponies building something
<Lambda> this was my maze, and it turned out to be pretty easy
<DarkMemories> herp derp
<Spellcrush> Derpy-de-derp
<ZSabotage> circut, that looks like Rampart, only with a security error
<DarkMemories> Man, I feel like an idiot.
<Andromeda> Her name is DITZY DOO@
<Andromeda> !*
<Outline> Landing amidst the stars = drifting in space, frozen and alone forever.
<DarkMemories> Not lseeping for four days does that to you
<ZSabotage> or connection error
<Ghosties> Why am I still here?
<Flashgen> I am doing fine Paint
<rubenflonne12> http://giftkrieg23.deviantart.com/gallery/30436047#/d3d3nzh here go ahead and right click and download the sheets
<Outline> Not really a positibe outcome.
<UxieLover1994> 13Also, one of my Pokemon in HeartGold (Togekiss) reached level 90
<PaintSplash> Is it Ditzy, or Bright eyes?
<Ghosties> 4Why did I not post in color?
<Flashgen> I am trying to write more so my I can steal an awesome pic for my fic
<Dee_Twenty> Because the power of Celestia compels you! :p
<PaintSplash> I've heard several names...
<Andromeda> I prefer Ditzy.
<ZSabotage> 6COLOR!?
<DarkMemories> Outline: Unless you land in one, you would be burnt to nothing instantaneously.
<ZSabotage> 0oh, i see
<rubenflonne12> looks like an old game
<ZSabotage> 0it looks alot like Rampart
<duMORI> its dawrf fort IIRC
<Lambda> I don't know how to change it at the moment though
<Lambda> hmm
<ZSabotage> 0or that
<ZSabotage> 0that too
<Lambda> give him guns!
<CircuitMane> So what, is it supposed to be a pony that made that?
<Andromeda> Also, good job at sealing your sister right in front of the sun during the Summer Sun Celebration.
<Lambda> that makes any game better!
<Lambda> jk
<DarkMemories> And since when is Ditzy Luna and Celestia's sister?
<rubenflonne12> well i use also the savage world core book with this x3 but this is the jist of it
<Outline> So... the moral here is "Don't shoot for the moon, because space is horrible and everything there will kill you"?
<Mikey> ::P
<duMORI> yeah it's that says so at the top is DF
<DarkMemories> xD
<Neon> Nah, a flamethrower.
<DarkMemories> Pretty much
<Mikey> give them unicorn horns or pegasus wings
<Lambda> XD
<Neon> He'll melt those pesky cubes.
<ZSabotage> 0aww snap, my adobe reader broke.
<Andromeda> That was very sneaky, nopony could think of where Celestia was. Except Pinkie Pie...
<rubenflonne12> blah
<Lambda> I should make a flamethrower easter egg
<duMORI> snap
<Flashgen> oh you silly fillies going and spoiling inspirational stuff
<DarkMemories> The only confirmed habitable places in the unvierse is about 1/4 of the earth's surface, and only about 1/3 of that space easily
<Lambda> hit f to fire flamethrower
<Dee_Twenty> For a player though this should be all I need?
<ZSabotage> 0and it updated...for some reason
<Lambda> but it just melts all the ice and you drown
<rubenflonne12> pretty much
<Andromeda> They're Goddesses. They don't need no stinkin' oxygen.
<PaintSplash> Magic...No need to explain.
<Outline> Need? No. But they probably enjoy it.
<duMORI> I'll torrent the core book as I'm intrested
<Andromeda> Being able to breath IS nice, I'll admt..
<Andromeda> admit*
<ZSabotage> 0now i gotta think of a cutie mark....and i got it
<PaintSplash> I suppose though explaining magic in scientific terms might destroy a persons brain.
<DarkMemories> Well, Celestia and Luna aren't the ones aiming for the stars.
<Andromeda> Twilight?
<Andromeda> Eos?
<DarkMemories> Nah, she doesn't explain magic
<duMORI> humm a cuite mark as fuzzballs
<Andromeda> EOS!
<Dee_Twenty> I've already got a ponysonna, so I can just use him.
<duMORI> i'll come back to it
<rubenflonne12> trebbles x3
<Andromeda> Alicorn of--*shot before secret is revealed*
<Neon> Hahaha, you should.
<ZSabotage> 0so do I, but mine uses guns...so, thinkin thats outta the question
<Dee_Twenty> And how fitting that my cutie mark is a D20. XD
<gingerale> What secret is that?
<gingerale> I hope it has nothing to do with the puppies
<Neon> Or make it a powerup that allows you to burn one slide.
<Lambda> XD
<duMORI> lol
<ZSabotage> 0aaaaannnnd, all my vector work is on my Linux partition, great.
<Lambda> press p for pony mode
<Lambda> I'll do that
<Outline> Celestia and Luna throw random objects into space for the fun of it, I'm sure.
<Lambda> it turns the game into a ponyville theme instead of a pirate theme
<duMORI> I got a busy day ahead so I ned to start round shit up.
<rubenflonne12> hehe
<Andromeda> Alicorn of whatever Celestial body Twilight Sparkle represents...
<DarkMemories> And that's the story of how Equestria was made...
<Andromeda> Thank you.
<mib_xosqn3> ok the kehnan and kel is almost over
<mib_xosqn3> i am going to go to bed
<rubenflonne12> sleep wellmib
<mib_xosqn3> thanks for streaming all the stuff
<Andromeda> But I think it involved more rocks.
<mib_xosqn3> it was fun
<Flashgen> Equestria was made by throwing junk in to space?
<rememberme> i have (maby) done it!
<duMORI> you need me at a latger date I'll dump my email. saundersmitchell@gmail.com
<SillyNilly> Hi
<DarkMemories> I should tell you guys my cutie mark story sometime, it's a doozy!
<duMORI> though I might be back soonish
<Andromeda> At least from Pinkie Pie's--yeah.
<mib_xosqn3> night all, see you tomrorw for the other streaming
<ZSabotage> 0ruben, anyway we can move this chat to skype or something, so i can boot up linux?
<mib_xosqn3> anon out
<duMORI> also aim is Dumorimasoddaa
<rememberme> working on my fanfic now
<DarkMemories> xD
<DarkMemories> Carrying over from the RP, I'm Pinkie Pie, so sorry guyz xD
<rubenflonne12> sure skype would be fine
<Andromeda> Speaking of the aforementioned 4-dimensional pony...
<rubenflonne12> anyone who wants to join, give your skype names
<rubenflonne12> rubenflonne is mine x3
<BlankFlankBrony> lol
<ZSabotage> 0zsmith1744
<BlankFlankBrony> Only 4 dimensions?
<Andromeda> Why didn't Pinkie Sense activate any time AFTER Feeling Pinkie Keen?
<SirSprinkles> 6...are there still ponies here? Oo
<Dee_Twenty> Hrm, have to download Skype, unless it can interact with MSN.
<Outline> Because nothing of importance happened on those days.
<Ghosties> 4I'm still here, SirSprinkles
<Outline> At all.
<CircuitMane> so am I
<rubenflonne12> im still here x3
<SirSprinkles> 6I wasn't really watching, was busy in a GET battle.
<rubenflonne12> well download it, its nice to just have
<Andromeda> Psychoshy was pretty dangerous if you ask me. (and pretty sexy) Who said that?
<SirSprinkles> 6That I just won by a single point.
<UxieLover1994> 13Hey, DSD, what should we do with our YouTube account once we make it?
<rubenflonne12> congratz
<CircuitMane> sweet!
<Ghosties> 4Awesome, Sprinks
<rubenflonne12> sprinks play some kablam
<Misti> does skype have a push to talk feature yet?
<CircuitMane> I'm just trying to chill down a bit
<CircuitMane> nope
<Misti> lame
<UxieLover1994> 13Re-mixing some music is a good idea
<Andromeda> She had a squirrel between her teeth.
<rubenflonne12> not yet x.x
<CircuitMane> it's called a mute button
<ZSabotage> 0get a headset thta mutes
<ZSabotage> 0my PSP had that
<Misti> i have one but i don't feel like breaking the switch
<ZSabotage> 0ya know, when skype on PSP was still a good idea
<UxieLover1994> 13And if I could, I'd do some walkthroughs for the first three games and ETD
<Andromeda> And not just danger twitches, there's falling objects, opening doors, other stuff...
<PaintSplash> Hey, squirrels are terrible
<PaintSplash> I had to take care of a baby squirrel once, and it was an abomination...
<Andromeda> DON'TCHU BE DISSIN' THE SQUIRRELIES
<Outline> I've never seen a squirrel. Reasonably happy about that, to be honest. They sound annoying.
<Misti> oh well i'll just keep with vent and mumble @_@
<rubenflonne12> okay added you zsab
<PaintSplash> I was very happen to reintroduce it into the wild
<ZSabotage> 0i got it
<Flashgen> I'm surprised there's no Pinkie Sense for "it's your birthday and you forgot"
<Lambda> What pony should you play as?
<Andromeda> HA!
<Mikey> XDDDD
<DSD> 4Well first we could have vids on music
<Lambda> @pony
<Steve> 12Lambda is 15Prince Blueb8lood
<Mikey> derpy
<Lambda> haha
<Lambda> derpy
<Lambda> perfect
<rubenflonne12> i feel skype would be easier chat system, i don't know how to set up a vent server x3
<Ascendant> Can't stand the connects/disconnects
<Andromeda> Well, then again. Pinkemena took over at that time.
<PaintSplash> It bit my mom, because I became to afraid of the thing to bathe it, so she did and it bit through the rubber glove...nasty lil fella.
<Ascendant> I'll unjupe it when I get it back online
<Andromeda> Pinkie Pie was somewhere else...
<Outline> There is. Unfortunately, the triggers are "Hair droopy, Angry feeling, allucination"
<RandomlyWeir> HAYO
<rememberme> in indiana they eat squirrel soup
<Andromeda> Sick bastards.
<DarkMemories> Wut?
<CircuitMane> yeah, skype is a lot easier. besides vent tends to have static issues at times since you need a server for it
<RandomlyWeir> Hello!
<rubenflonne12> ya
<DarkMemories> How in the hell did the topic shift to squirrel soup?
<RandomlyWeir> *sigh*
<DarkMemories> Hello...?
<Outline> Hello there RandomlyWier.
<RandomlyWeir> Uh
<PaintSplash> My friend also took care of an abandoned baby squirrel....and that one was awesome...but maybe he was lucky, or I'm severely unlucky.

<DSD> 4Like we could link it to the credits page
<DarkMemories> I've been pretty active.
<Andromeda> Unless the squirrel came from Canterlot Gardens...
<RandomlyWeir> Not here
<Outline> Except fluttershy, of course. She's excatly the right amount.

<Andromeda> There are TWO Nightmare Moons!
<RandomlyWeir> Ok

<NightmareMoon> I am the real Nightmare Moon!
<rubenflonne12> awesomeness thats 2 people for the list
<Misti> but they do! lol
<DarkMemories> Not really
<Dee_Twenty> There we go. Pain in the ass Skype site made me have to try registering half a dozen times.
<rubenflonne12> so okay who else wanted to join so i could write your names down
<Andromeda> Evacuate via Pegasus if you have to@
<rubenflonne12> and ya it can be a pain
<Andromeda> !*
<PaintSplash> Come to think of it...I was awful with all animals...except dogs...
<Nightmare_Moon> You're kidding? You're kidding, right?
<PaintSplash> But I'm rambling
<duMORI> I'm intrested if timeing is possable am UK brony
<Flashgen> dogs always bark at me randomly
<CircuitMane> Tell them to move the freakin mic away
<NightmareMoon> You foal, you have no IDEA who you challenge.
<DarkMemories> Not meaning to be offensive or anything. But the other NMM is here, just going really all-out in the RP channel atm.
<rememberme> i know i guy that has 3 of him in his upcomeing comic that has nothing to do with ponys
<Dee_Twenty> Alright, user name will be RurikNiall as soon as I get the program set up.
<rubenflonne12> sure we can try
<DarkMemories> And there he/she is! xD
<duMORI> I currently only have skype on my Iphone XD
<rubenflonne12> alright Dee
<NightmareMoon> XD'
<NightmareMoon> I noticed.
*Nightmare_Moon monologues like a boss.
<DSD> 4Malefor
<DSD> 4I get to fight him
<PaintSplash> Cats like me...they like seek me out....but I'm allergic.
<Andromeda> I'm hiding in a dimensional rift, if you all want to die during a battle between two Nightmares, suit yourselves!
<NightmareMoon> The evil twin of Nightmare Moon?
<DarkMemories> Pinkie Pie is so there
<DarkMemories> xD
<DarkMemories> You mean Trollestia?
<NightmareMoon> Not evil enough.
<UxieLover1994> 13Cool~
<Lambda> okay
<Nightmare_Moon> "I am Nightmare Moon, and I've come to eat your Horcruxes!"
<Lambda> so far
<PaintSplash> Diet coke of evil?
<Andromeda> That fan letter was pretty damn evil...
<Mikey> XD
<DSD> 4Color = purple
<NightmareMoon> Evil, yes, but not evil enough to be the evil twin of one who is already evil.
<DarkMemories> Trollestia? Not evil enough?
<DSD> 4Cynder=black but purple
*DarkMemories does not compute
<Lambda> when you hit p, instead of saying "Quest for Booty... On Ice!"
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay!
<[zZz]ekeS> =.=
<NightmareMoon> Trollestia is in it for the lulz.
<Andromeda> The fan letter she gave Luna that was fake. That was beyond normal evil.
<DSD> 4Used XD
<rememberme> i am hiding outside of the univers if this gets any more uot of wack
<NightmareMoon> XD
<rubenflonne12> awesome this is going to be fun
<UxieLover1994> 13Music videos. There's plenty, but whole remixes are great!
<rubenflonne12> more people the better
<DarkMemories> Everypony who's in it for the lulz is evil
<[zZz]ekeS> what in the hell

<Mikey> XD
<CharlesAppleJackson> OHAI KENAN
<Mikey> [00:21] <@Lambda> when you hit p, instead of saying "Quest for Booty... On Ice!"
<Mikey> [00:22] * Lambda (LordOfTheBidoof@79E138.B3FA35.39A197.CF38C9) Quit ( Connection closed )
<DarkMemories> Welcome to global economy of the present.
<PaintSplash> Ha
<Lambda> my connection died
<gingerale> So I usually go "gogdamnit I'm hungry, but I'll just deal with it" until afternoon when I finally eat something.
<DarkMemories> xD
<Lambda> what I was going to say
<Andromeda> UPDATE!
<gingerale> But now that I have money I can just eat since I can buy food properly
<Dee_Twenty> Alright, all set.
<DSD> 4Hm
<PaintSplash> Money is a nice thing
<Andromeda> TROLLESTIA IS THE PINK CELESTIA HASBRO TOY@
<Lambda> was now it'll change so it says "Derpy's Muffin Adventure!" instead
<DarkMemories> And that's weird... because?
<DSD> 4Whats the deal with darkenss in this set of games?
<DarkMemories> Possibly.
<Andromeda> !*
<PaintSplash> Debt is a not so fun game...that you can't win.
<Mikey> XD
<Mikey> that's awesome
<DSD> 4Cynders evil in the first got that
<gingerale> It's weird because I still have the whole "I'll just try to deal with it" thing going on in my head when I'm hungry as heck
<DarkMemories> But that's TrollHasbroia.
<DSD> 4Spyro went dark in the second
<gingerale> I need to learn to actually get up and go eat
<Andromeda> How do you pronouce that?
<Lambda> I'm not gonna tell anyone but you about this change either
<DarkMemories> Don't get fat.
<DSD> 4And in the third they both have moments
<UxieLover1994> 13Darkness is evil
<DarkMemories> I was fat once,.
<DarkMemories> I didn't like it
<DarkMemories> xD
<UxieLover1994> 13That's right
<Andromeda> Nothing wrong with it.
<gingerale> I excercise enough
<Mikey> yay
<DarkMemories> eh, I'm not skinny or anything.
<Lambda> and when I upload the game online I'll see if anyone notices
<rememberme> macking a new pony in my fanfic calling him jack
<Lambda> :P
<PaintSplash> I have a medical condition that requires me to eat something sugary every few hours
<Mikey> XD
<UxieLover1994> 13Darkness appears to be hate and rage
<Klondike> Jack Daniels?
<Mikey> I'll play it in that mode whenever it's done
<Lambda> Hahaha
<DarkMemories> Diabetes type (1 or 2 forget which)
<rubenflonne12> added
<duMORI> installing skype
<DarkMemories> *?
<DSD> 4Right
<gingerale> But being hungry makes it really freaking difficult to work on any drawings or projects
<rememberme> hipoglicimc
<PaintSplash> Hypoglycemic actually
<DSD> 4But Cynder doesn't seem to hate
<gingerale> So.. Breakfast time. Off I go
<rubenflonne12> 5 people :3
<rubenflonne12> great turn out
<PaintSplash> its like bizarro diabetes.
<DSD> 4Spyro just got caught off guard
<UxieLover1994> 13She was controlled
<Andromeda> I feel the urge to post a link to a certain drawing.
<gingerale> What's sugary enough? Tea with three spoonfuls?
<rememberme> can spell if my life depends on it
<Andromeda> But I'm worried about two things.
<PaintSplash> When my doctor can reffer me to docter pepper...thats an odd day
<UxieLover1994> 13it's mostly of negitve emotons
<Flashgen> haha
<Flashgen> ....sorry
<DSD> 4Yea
<gingerale> Andromeda: what are you worried about?
<Flashgen> I'll go kick myself now
<Andromeda> One: It's on FurAffinity (which I'm part of (bite me if you will))
<CharlesAppleJackson> PFFFFFFFFFFFF
<DSD> 4I thought she had lost them and he does a trick and shes evil
<CharlesAppleJackson> I don't remember this episode xD
<gingerale> Huh? Have I met you before?
<rubenflonne12> just one more time, does anyone else want to join? and if your already in it, can you say it again, so i can make sure i have all your names
<gingerale> Your name is familiar
<gingerale> Do you go to MSPA forums?
<Andromeda> Me?
<gingerale> Steam chats?
<gingerale> You
<PaintSplash> I actually 't drink tea...I have never found a tea I like...
<Andromeda> Nnnnooooo.
<UxieLover1994> 13I've got the same views on Darkness as Aqua, but I hope the villains can relise their ways and change
<PaintSplash> I'm a coffee guy, a sissy frozen coffee guy...
<DSD> 4Also it seems Malefor did not take it off
<gingerale> Hmm..
<gingerale> deviantArt?
<DSD> 4the chain
<Andromeda> Have an account there, yes.
<Chatoyant> frozen coffee is manly.
<gingerale> Oh well, what's the second point?
<DSD> 4It went poof and came back easy
<Chatoyant> unless you get the girly flavors. then you're a sissy.
<DSD> 4He didn't even touch it
<BlankFlankBrony> I like chai tea, and green tea isn't bad as a meal drink... but coffee? No thanks!
<PaintSplash> what constitutes a girly flavor?
<DarkMemories> Wut.
<UxieLover1994> 13The only ones in the KH series who still have a chance are Pete and Barbossa (once he's revived)
<Chatoyant> anything that isn't as black as night.
<CharlesAppleJackson> oh my god this is amazin
<Andromeda> It's related to DarkMemories earlier sentence: "Don't get fat."
<Chatoyant> :3
<PaintSplash> that was my point...
<gingerale> Ah
<DarkMemories> Anything that's not "black" can be considered girly by some people xP
<gingerale> Hmm
<rubenflonne12> yes this show was so great
<PaintSplash> peppermin Mocha Frappechino.
<DarkMemories> In regards to coffee.
<Andromeda> There's another drawing too.
<gingerale> So far my deviantArt only has one pony
<UxieLover1994> 13Anastasia's even more evil than Malefor
<PaintSplash> Super Fru Fru...
<Andromeda> With Lyra instead of Luna
<Dee_Twenty> Nick was full of awesome at one point.
<UxieLover1994> 13So, in the KH series, she's pure evil
<gingerale> I need to get another pony on it sometime
<PaintSplash> but...its so tasty...
<Chatoyant> nah i'm actually a gigantic sissy too and i have to make my coffee half milk so i don't cringe.
<CharlesAppleJackson> yes
<gingerale> Yeah, I'll pass the creepy fat things <.<
<DarkMemories> YAY MOAR LYRA.
<gingerale> Two things really put me off in fanart
*DSD 4is using Fury mode on Malefor
<DarkMemories> Unless it's... fat Lyra...
<Andromeda> It ain't THAT creepy...
<DarkMemories> *gulp*
<Andromeda> It's kinda like that...
<Lambda> Sweet
<PaintSplash> Also, that is a great name for a pony...Peppermint Mocha....
<UxieLover1994> 13:/
<Lambda> Everything is working so far
<Mikey> :D
<Lambda> I just need to make a Derpy picture
<gingerale> The huge fat things and anthros.
<DarkMemories> I'd say that's a girly cup of coffee.
<Andromeda> HEY!
<gingerale> I love humanized ponies though :B
<Dee_Twenty> If this episode were on today there'd be people all up in arms about it encouraging homosexuality.
<Nightmare_Moon> And now, I must sleep. It's morning somewhere
<DSD> 4Almost done but almost dead
<gingerale> What? Anthros just really put me off
<BlankFlankBrony> G'night NMM
<DarkMemories> Anything that isn't based off of a traditional pony body is kinda weird to me, imo.
<UxieLover1994> 13Good and bad
<DarkMemories> Anthro? Yuck.
<Andromeda> Are you implying something about Furries?
<PaintSplash> wait anthros in general or anthro ponies?
<Mikey> if you don't wanna make one I could try my hand at it
<DarkMemories> I can live with human version of the ponies.
<gingerale> No, I'm just saying it's not my thing at all
<DarkMemories> But mixing features? Ugh, I don't like it.
<DSD> 4And i won without dieing
<Lambda> Sure!
<UxieLover1994> 13Cool!
<DSD> 4and the worlds ending
<Mikey> omg yay
<Lambda> Thanks
<Lambda> :D
<UxieLover1994> 13Yikes!
<Mikey> how many pixels should it be
<gingerale> I'm okay with uhh.. Well Disney style. Like those on Treasure Planet. They were great.
<duMORI> lmao yeah dumb america
<Andromeda> But you're not bashing it, right>
<Andromeda> ?*
<UxieLover1994> 13*Please, save us Spyro*
<duMORI> and will westan english media tbh
<duMORI> but still
<DSD> 4See in the cutscene it shows a whole world
<Lambda> 55 x 55
<Lambda> D:
<gingerale> You're paranoid xD
<Lambda> I know that's small
<Mikey> alright
<DSD> 4Theres no way it was all done
<Andromeda> Just overly sensitive...
<Lambda> but it has to be precise or else it gets buggy
<Mikey> should I make it with the same style as the pic you posted?
<UxieLover1994> 13*Gulp*
<Mikey> yeah that's fine
<rubenflonne12> its all stupid here right now x.x
<Mikey> :P
<CharlesAppleJackson> silly america
<Andromeda> With a bad temper
<Lambda> yeah, that would be nice
<Mikey> alright
<gingerale> I have no reason to bash things just because I don't find the concept attractive.
<Lambda> thanks Mikey
<DSD> 4More boss fight while we fall
<DSD> 4Reminds me of kh2
<Mikey> yep!! I need something to do anyways
<PaintSplash> That stuff doesn't bother me much cause I'm a internet veteran...except dirty pony stuff...that somehow is the first thing in long time to make me recoil...
<duMORI> I know I watch your media and news and go OMG
<Lambda> same here
<Lambda> which is why I'm making this game
<Andromeda> Let me just say this: How many of you here have killed 6 people in real life?
<duMORI> still our polotics are LAME atm
<Mikey> XD
<UxieLover1994> 13Yeah, it does
<Mikey> so nothing planned for the weekend? :P
<Outline> What.
<gingerale> That's a weird thing to ask
<Andromeda> Maybe I shouldn't have said that...
<PaintSplash> But Anthros...I'm seasoned...I've seen it all...I'm no longer surprised
<Lambda> well, not tonight or tomorrow morning
<Lambda> but there's a carnival in town I want to go to sometime tomorrow
<Mikey> haha
<gingerale> Well porn in general makes me recoil still even though I've been active on the 'net for like ten years.
<Mikey> oh cool
<duMORI> the operition is useless and the coaltion is useing the libdems as fall guys
<Chatoyant> ...did they have to die all at once, or separately?
<gingerale> Just can't see the appeal.
<duMORI> mostly due to the tory media making it so
<DSD> 4I died so i'm restarting
<Mikey> the fair doesn't come here til august
<UxieLover1994> 13Who do you think is the most evil Disney Villain (other than Maleficent and Pete) in the KH series?
<Lambda> D:
<Lambda> that's forever!
<Dee_Twenty> On the bright side we don't have laws against speaking your mind. Sis was telling me about a recent case in Sweden where a guy was thrown in jail for speaking his mind about homosexuality. While I may strongly disagree with him I think it's ridiculous to be thrown in jail for insulting somepony.
<Andromeda> Society avoids me, despite it happening 6 years ago... It was ONE killing spree Illinois! ONE!
<DarkMemories> xD
<gingerale> xD
<Mikey> that's how I feel with warped which is also in august for me
<Mikey> @___@;
<Andromeda> I'm serious.
<Lambda> D:
<duMORI> yeah
<gingerale> Uh huh
<CharlesAppleJackson> wait... sweden, seriously?
<PaintSplash> I'm not sure how far into this coversation we can go...this is the PG chat, last time we mentioned furries we got a warning....
<Dee_Twenty> Yeah.
<PaintSplash> So I have no rebuttal
<duMORI> nazi opupied contrys have dumb laws tbh
<CharlesAppleJackson> that's the last place I'd think of that happening
<DarkMemories> http://cdn1.knowyourmeme.com/i/000/107/432/original/i_hug_that_feel.png?1300595876
<gingerale> Why would "furries" give a warning?
<CharlesAppleJackson> weird
<Andromeda> Oh Celestia--what gingerale said.
<CharlesAppleJackson> well yeah I guess that might have something to do with it
<DarkMemories> Well, we don't want it to turn into pornagraphic discussion.
<duMORI> they have huge anit discrimation laws ect
<PaintSplash> I guess the mod thought things were going down a non PG road
<Andromeda> Hang on.
<duMORI> but they GO TOO FAR
<BlankFlankBrony> Because it's easy to go from Furry to Interent Rules.
<gingerale> But.. There's porn of everything. So you couldn't be able to discuss anything.
<DarkMemories> Or anythign suggestive, for that matter.
<Mikey> I might go to a concert at the last minute tomorrow but it's not a sure thing
<PaintSplash> wandering into the Everfree Forest so to speak
<DarkMemories> You can't discuss the pornographic side of everything.
<Andromeda> Why is it that when sombody says furry, they instantly go to pornagraphic things?
<DarkMemories> But, enough on this.
<Andromeda> somebody*
<Lambda> Oh that would be cool
<duMORI> its illegal to disagree about the holocaust to the point of saying that certain touted facts are illogical can get you arested.
<PaintSplash> The term is stained
<Lambda> who's concert is it?
<Dee_Twenty> Sitcom tropes say he gets it wrong.
<gingerale> Oh well
<Mikey> taking back sunday
<DSD> 4The Queen
<DarkMemories> Because of the sstereotype on the furry community, AKA "Yiff in hell furfag". But again, enoug.
<duMORI> of corse
<Mikey> but if I go it's mainly just to see my friends, I have a couple of their albums though
<Andromeda> And people wonder why some of us hate the general public...
<PaintSplash> thats why when artsits who don't want to be associated with it label themselves "Anthro Artists"
<Balloons> Ok dark enough please.
<DarkMemories> because It's full of morons?
<Andromeda> Yes.
<DarkMemories> I'm going to stop, yes.
<Mikey> one of my friends was talking about it, and it's her first time in the pit completely by herself since none of her other friends are coming
<gingerale> I was a moron once!
<gingerale> I got better ^^
<PaintSplash> the creepiest people also seem to be the most vocal
<Andromeda> HAVE A COOKIE!
<DarkMemories> Just going a little to in-depth on my reasons, sorry.
<gingerale> Yaaay!
<Mikey> and one of my other friends is going, and I like the band so I figured I'd ask about going last minute to my mom and she said we might depending on how she feels
*gingerale om nom nom
<UxieLover1994> 13She's not as evil as Lady Tremaine and her daughters, though
<CharlesAppleJackson> oh man
<CharlesAppleJackson> that's classic
<Lambda> Oh cool
<UxieLover1994> 13Remember when they tried to murder Cindy?
<Andromeda> I'm one of the quiet ones. They never expected me to kill...
<Lambda> that should be fun
<Chatoyant> the vocal minority is a big thing in most fandoms/general areas of interest, though.
<Mikey> yeah, if I get to go
<DarkMemories> Yeah.
<Mikey> I hope so
<Lambda> yeah
<BlankFlankBrony> Okay, I'm going to call it a night. Take care, all!
<Chatoyant> niight.
<rubenflonne12> i added you Dee just letting you know
<DarkMemories> G'night mate.
<Lambda> they have bands at this carnival tomorrow too
<PaintSplash> Like drawing characters like that is fun, you can d alot of things with it...but then theres those really loud weird guys, that wear the suits...
<UxieLover1994> 13That was pure evil. Even Aqua senced their HUGE amont of darkness by just passing them
<PaintSplash> and stuff
<CircuitMane> the show's not too bad
<Andromeda> And I'm gonna go eat cheesecake!
<Lambda> but you have to be 21 to go to the concert
<Mikey> do you know the names of any of them?
<Mikey> ahhhh
<Mikey> that sucks
<Chatoyant> i want cheescake.
<Lambda> because there's implied drinking involved
<Mikey> jarrod gorbel was in town tonight and I couldn't go because it was at a bar ;___;
<duMORI> aye
<Andromeda> Me too...
<gingerale> Oh!
<Mikey> which sucks I love him so much
<gingerale> My breakfast!
<gingerale> I forgot
*gingerale is off
<Mikey> his last show here was 21+ too
<DSD> 4Yea
<CharlesAppleJackson> are you kidding
<gingerale> Oh yeah
<Andromeda> I was wondering why he hadn't left earlier.
<CharlesAppleJackson> it's more than not too bad
<Dee_Twenty> I noticed. Looking over these rules while I wait to get an invite to the chat.
<Mikey> and faster pussycat in july is 21+ but we might sit outside and listen for that one
<gingerale> I'm one of the quiet ones too
<PaintSplash> I have a sudden craving for bacon
<CharlesAppleJackson> NOSTALGIA TELLS ME SO
<gingerale> But I have military training
<UxieLover1994> 13Even I made a video to show how evil they really are: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dr8WXLvJGt4
<gingerale> \o/
<DarkMemories> Breakfast?
<CircuitMane> I used to watch All That
<gingerale> Off again!
<CharlesAppleJackson> anyway night everypony
<DarkMemories> Oh wait.
<DarkMemories> It's almost 4 am
<rubenflonne12> night apple
<DarkMemories> xD
<CharlesAppleJackson> see y'all next frahday, ya hear?
<Andromeda> 2:37 here.
<DarkMemories> Lol, insomnia is cereal business
<Chatoyant> oh my god you're right. ._.
<Chatoyant> i don't want to go to bed though.
<rubenflonne12> alright i will start up a chat in a moment
<PaintSplash> I'm quiet, and have four swords, and 2 clubs stashed around my house
<ZSabotage> can you send those links again ruben?
<Lambda> Yeah, if that would work that would be cool
<rubenflonne12> sure
<Andromeda> I prefer knives of any kind.
<UxieLover1994> 13There is nothing nice about them. They are ugly, selfish witches who tourcher others to get their own way.
<rubenflonne12> on skype or here?
<Chatoyant> i know karate, kung fu and several other dangerous words.
<gingerale> Oh cool, apparently I convinced MadMax to go play Amnesia *proud* :B
<gingerale> Off once more!
<DarkMemories> xD
<PaintSplash> Any burgular that comes in here is going to get the broad side of a claymore
<DarkMemories> Lol
<Andromeda> Slice, slice, cut, cut, slit, slit!
<DarkMemories> Can't wait to see that reaction.
<DarkMemories> I bought Amnesia.
<DarkMemories> I still haven't played it.
<DarkMemories> xD
<DarkMemories> I'm a wuss when it comes to horror games.
<DarkMemories> I love horror novels...
<Mikey> yeah and it's on a saturday
<UxieLover1994> 13Put all the villains you know into one, then times it by three. The trio are even more evil than all that
<Dee_Twenty> Probably be back here tomorrow too, or rather today since it's Saturday here. XD
<gingerale> Amnesia will fix any wussiness over horror games
<DarkMemories> I can't get enough horror film...
<Andromeda> The red starts pouring out their necks then they hear me SING!
<PaintSplash> I labled one of the clubs "Stun" and the Machete "Kill"
<Mikey> faster pussycat was my first concert ever I was 8 years old
<DarkMemories> But I just can't do games.
<Outline> Wouldn't you rather that burglar get the sharp side of said claymore?
<gingerale> Once you're through it no other game will feel good enoguh xD
<Mikey> I want to see them again so bad or at the very least hear them live!!!
<Mikey> :C
<ZSabotage> doesnt matter
<DSD> 4Almost killed him
<gingerale> I played Dead Space after it and I was just singing to "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" happily at that one point
<Lambda> Yeah, that would be really cool
<PaintSplash> Actually, the claymore isn't even sharp anymore...except for the tip
<DSD> 4Just missed a button
<Andromeda> MAKE US WHOLE!
<gingerale> There's NOTHING scary about Dead Space for me
<PaintSplash> so I'd have to poke him to death
<DarkMemories> Lol
<gingerale> Oh
<gingerale> Danit
<gingerale> Breakfast
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay
<gingerale> *darnit
<gingerale> Off agaiiiiiin!
<Lambda> I think that's cool that you've been going to shows since you were
<Lambda> 8
<Lambda> oops
<Lambda> stupid enter key
<DarkMemories> What was that other game made by the same developers?
<Andromeda> STEP THREE!!
<DarkMemories> I'm pretty sure it started with a P, or M or something
<rubenflonne12> x3 well let me get you all in a chat
<Andromeda> Cross my heart and hope to die...
<UxieLover1994> 13Barbossa may be evil, but he's most likely to become a neutral character in a future game
<rubenflonne12> circuit would you like to join? or nah?
<Andromeda> Stick a ne--cupcake in my eye...
<rubenflonne12> or sprinkles or ghosties?
<Ghosties> 4I would, but sadly, I'm sleepy as shit
<UxieLover1994> 13Gantu, also, should he ever return in a future game
*DarkMemories sticks his arm out, and turns it
<DSD> 4God he doesn't die even when you hit beat him twice
<Ghosties> 4I appreciate the offer, though
<gingerale> Penumbra, but you could fight the monsters on it so it's not as good
*DarkMemories then takes his hand, puts it in his mouth, and gulps
<Mikey> yeahh
*DarkMemories then makes an outline around himself
<UxieLover1994> 13I'll say
<Andromeda> You mean hoof, right?
<gingerale> Darnit, where is that shirt of miiine? Got to get dressed properly finally. (Past 10 am) :I
*DarkMemories puts an arm within the outline
<rememberme> done with the rough draft of my fanfic here is it any good https://docs.google.com/document/d/11_ETMXlvbZCATU4Nawn-WEigPcCQfDAVg_AXstXMelc/edit?authkey=CMPz3ugC&hl=en_US
<Dee_Twenty> I want to eat at Pirate Hank's.
<Mikey> I'm surprised I even remember it all; it was father's day and so my mom bought tickets for us all to go, my dad had me hooked on them since I was 2, since it's 80's music that's one of the bands he was really into back in the day
<rubenflonne12> well we are not starting it soon x3
<gingerale> rememberme: #EquestrianStudy
<rubenflonne12> we are just getting set up and contacts
<gingerale> They discuss stuff like that
<gingerale> AHH!
<Mikey> and the venue was really small, I don't even think it's open anymore
<gingerale> Breakfast!
<Andromeda> HAHAHAHAAA!
<rememberme> ok
<rubenflonne12> and figuring times x3
<Andromeda> Forcing schizophrenia on yourself isn't easy...
<Andromeda> But I did it. ^^
<Lambda> oh hey
<Andromeda> Gives me someone to talk to.
<Lambda> sorry for being off topic, but I just wanted to let you know that when you hit p the treasure chest turns into a giant muffin
<Mikey> XD that's awesome
<Andromeda> Fluttershy, Fluttershy, oooh Flutter Flutter Flutter, Fluttershy!
<PaintSplash> This chat could very well be a manifestation of your schizophrenia...and we are all voices.
<Andromeda> Never thought about that.
<DSD> 4I need to fury the third part
<DSD> 4Fury!!!
<Andromeda> But, I AM demented after all...
<PaintSplash> Oh man, I broke prime directive...I wasn't supposed to tell you that.
<Andromeda> Reverse psychology.
<SirSprinkles> 6What's going on now?
<PaintSplash> I hate thinking of ideas that sound like they came from a stoners mouth.
<Andromeda> Which is why I contradict and plan EVERYTHING I say...
<rubenflonne12> getting ready for a MLP D&D would you like to join sprinkles?
<Dee_Twenty> My Little Pony: Friendship is Savage.
<SirSprinkles> 6...YES
<rubenflonne12> we are just getting contacts out of the way and plesentries
<SirSprinkles> 6I love D&D
<rubenflonne12> good :3
<Andromeda> Wait, are you implying that I'm on drugs?
<duMORI> cool
<rubenflonne12> rubenflonne is the skype name add me and i will get you in the group :3
<PaintSplash> I think I was implying I'm on drugs
<RainBroDash> OHAI GUISE HOW IS TING
<PaintSplash> which I'm not
<duMORI> hai
<PaintSplash> but I often sound like it
<UxieLover1994> 13DDD's gotta write new plotlines for the worlds
<UxieLover1994> 13I'm sick of having to repeat the story for Agrabah, Wonderland and Olympus Coliseum in THREE games
<UxieLover1994> 13But, the game's got one new world. I just hope those gypsies won't gag Sora or Riku like they did to the main characters in the film they came from
<duMORI> soo much caffine so twitcy
<Outline> You're right Andromeda. Fluttershy fits that song so much better than Lollipop.
<UxieLover1994> 13Remember the song "The Court of Miracles"? That's what I meant
<RainBroDash> sooo twitchy :P
<CircuitMane> so much Kel
<DarkMemories> Caffeinne is a drug.
<Ghosties> 4RainBroDash, seemingly awakening from idleness
<Andromeda> It's interesting when you look at how you talk online, and then you look at how you act in real life.
<RainBroDash> I's playing CoD with a brony
<Ghosties> 4Ah
<RainBroDash> don't be hatin' now
<Andromeda> It makes you think, "Wow. I wish I really was that guy..."
<Ghosties> 4Hey, you can enjoy whatever game you like
<PaintSplash> For instance, in an alternate universe where everyones gender was reversed, if you were to go there and date your female self, would that be "incestous?"
<RainBroDash> :D
<RainBroDash> <3
<Ghosties> 4Even if it does suck :P
<duMORI> :P
<Lambda> hmm
<Andromeda> It means you have an extreme ego, I know that much.
<DarkMemories> That's sortof not a good topic for this chat.
<PaintSplash> I'm proud of that one actually, I came up with that gem at a bonfire
<Lambda> what should the obstacles be?
<duMORI> just cos I don'r enjoy dosen'r mean I hate it
<DSD> 4wow
<SirSprinkles> 6...skype...that might be an issue.
<DarkMemories> The internet had that idea first, for the record.
<SirSprinkles> 6I have to check and see if it's blocked.
<PaintSplash> Well, I didn't want to start a dialogue about
<PaintSplash> it
<DarkMemories> welcome to Rule 63.
<Mikey> not sure...@___@; I'm not good with stuff like that haha NO BRAINPOWER ALLOWED WITH ME
<Mikey> workin on the derpy eyes though
<rubenflonne12> well if it is, we will work on something else :3
<PaintSplash> I didn't know...at the time, this was years ago
<DarkMemories> Okay, no more on this I suppose.
<DSD> 4i got two of the Achievements for one go
<Andromeda> Oh my Celestia it never stops...
<PaintSplash> I was merely giving an example.
<Outline> Ehh. I think my internet self and actual self would probably hate eachother.
<DSD> 4Beating his lair and beating him with out dieing
<DSD> 4 32/50
<Outline> I talk far too much here.
<PaintSplash> heres a safer topic
<rememberme> i concor
<Lambda> haha, nice. I was thinking clouds maybe
<Andromeda> My self would kill me online...
<UxieLover1994> 13Cool!
<DSD> 4And i got the game yesterday
<Balloons> i'm very quiet in and out of chat.
<DSD> 4Wow
<PaintSplash> probably stupid though
<Outline> This hasn't gone unnoticed Balloons :P
<Balloons> xD
<UxieLover1994> 13Wow!
<Mikey> BALLOONS! No, CANDY! NO, STREAMERS!!!
<DarkMemories> My internet self ischarismatic and happy with whatever the hell happens, while my IRL is like Fluttershy, only more secretly hating the guts of everybody aorund me.
<PaintSplash> if there were an infinite number of alternate universe, and you had a choice of which one to live in, which would you choose?
<duMORI> why woudl they block skype
<Andromeda> DarkMemories. My twin.
<Lambda> Hahaha
<duMORI> where the hell are you?
<SillyNilly> This one. I love this one.
<DarkMemories> xD
<SirSprinkles> 6Cafe
<Lambda> or just Pinkie Pie making an evil face
<SirSprinkles> 6It's not blocked.
<Mikey> XDDD
<rubenflonne12> awesome
<duMORI> ah
<SirSprinkles> 6But some of the most RANDOM things are blocked.
<DSD> 4And Malefor lost to dead ghosts
<Lambda> I'll do balloons
<Lambda> I like that idea
<PaintSplash> Misanthropic eh Dark.
<DarkMemories> I would live in the one that's exactly like this one, only Billy Mays didn't die
<duMORI> lol
<DarkMemories> Only IRL.
<Mikey> I was kidding but that could work :P
<PaintSplash> thats the kind of answer I like to hear.
<Lambda> :P
<UxieLover1994> 13Sweet!
<PaintSplash> I flip and flop between misanthropicness...
<Andromeda> I would live in the universe that represents my imagination and fantasies, or Equestria, or what DarkMemories suggested.
<DarkMemories> But I hang around the minorities like this on the internet, where there're actually intelligent people, so I can actually enjoy conversing.
<PaintSplash> I will simplify it by saying every trip to wallmart is a ruined day
<DarkMemories> I don't get to choose who I be around IRL.,
<DSD> 4Nice world is saved
<DarkMemories> So I end up with idiots.
<DarkMemories> xP
<Andromeda> Like children
<Andromeda> I hate children
<duMORI> its frezzeing in the frezzer OMFG
<PaintSplash> Wallmart is kind of like a mueseum...
<duMORI> wtf is that place
*Fooby works with children
<UxieLover1994> 13That's right!
<Andromeda> Hate them... so.. much...
<PaintSplash> of Souldead...miserable people...
<rubenflonne12> do you need my name again for skype sprinkles?
<DSD> 4Dragon is stars looks nice
<PaintSplash> walking meatsacks with moutholes, with little failure trails behind them...
<Outline> @ Paintsplash, I'd probably head to a universe where the technology to freely travel between these universes had been developed, and the people were responsible enough to refrain from abusing it.
<Zebranky> DarkMemories: You're hanging out with the wrong people IRL.
<UxieLover1994> 13Hm
<Zebranky> I mean, my roommates are kind of anti-pony.
<Andromeda> I want to kick my siblings' in the teeth every single time I see or hear their voices...
<DSD> 4Now i want true ending
<DarkMemories> I mean, I don't get a choice.
<Ali1017> grimdark much?
<UxieLover1994> 13Yes, you sure do
<Andromeda> Nope.
<Zebranky> But they're not going to get on my case for it.
<PaintSplash> Outline, I'd go the same way pretty much...the ability to visit ther unvierses in said universe is sort of the "infinite wishing" rule.
<DSD> 4I still think my plot idea would tie it all in
<Mikey> ....wow my derpy sucks :C
<PaintSplash> Oh I hate my family...
<UxieLover1994> 13True
<Andromeda> I love that word...
<Zebranky> And I met them on the internets.
<Andromeda> Grimdark...
<PaintSplash> actually, I feel nothing...I'd say thats worse
<RainBroDash> what's this you guys be up to?
<DarkMemories> I live in the area where there are both no PC gamers out of the gaming population, and there're a bunch of influxes of ghettos populations.
<RainBroDash> oh, D&D?
<PaintSplash> cause at least if you feel...you care.
<Outline> Point, but think about it. A universe where people could travel to wherever they wanted to go, but didn't see any need to do so. That'd be a worthwhile place to be, imho.
<Andromeda> Grimdark.

<rubenflonne12> savage lands
<PaintSplash> I'm clean...I'm not a beer person...or a smoker, but I respect your right to smoke and drink as you please
<gingerale> Sounds good!
<rememberme> cave men invented beer
<Mikey> lol neopets
<Mikey> my bilge dice options just now were "6 6 6"
<Andromeda> Rememberme is Nostradomus
<PaintSplash> Just...don't smoke near me....I am actually allergic...
<CroupDockHaunch> I'm Japanese, so it's something that's always gone with beer for me
<Andromeda> I don't smoke.
<Lambda> XD
<rememberme> who
<Tenaris> We need a ponifyed version of Guile with a american flag birthma--cutie mark on his flank
<Andromeda> I drank during the six years ago where I went on the K-spree.
<Mikey> I surprisingly get that score on neopets alot
<gingerale> I'm Finnish so everything goes with beer to me 8D
<Mikey> ~THE DEVIL~
<Lambda> dun dun DUN
<CroupDockHaunch> lol!
<PaintSplash> One of your identities I'm sure smokes.
<CircuitMane> wow, why hasn't anyone tried to kill him?
<Mikey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY4-pJ0icfk
<Andromeda> Multiple Personality Disorder or not, I stay away from those..

<duMORI> LMAO
<Lambda> XD
<gingerale> Ever had kebab?
<gingerale> Food of the gods themselves
<rubenflonne12> xD now he is dead
<Andromeda> Oh man I wish...
<PaintSplash> Depends, is kebab what I think it is?
<rememberme> I just had an ide for a pony that runs a night club and maks his own wine
<DarkMemories> I could go for a cheeseburger right now
<Andromeda> It looks good....
<gingerale> rememberme: I have an OC called Malt Lager :B
<DarkMemories> [/american]
<Andromeda> BURGER TAAAAANNK!!
<DarkMemories> And yes, I've eaten kebab.
<PaintSplash> Bacon, Mushroom, Montery jack cheese burger
<DarkMemories> It's grilled stuff on a stick.
<gingerale> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/54/D%C3%B6ner_kebab_in_Helsinki.jpg
<CroupDockHaunch> I had kebab earlier this week
<gingerale> This is kebab
<gingerale> Not some stick stuff
<gingerale> This is proper kebab
<CircuitMane> saved by dumb luck
<Zebranky> CroupDockHaunch: I've had apfelwein in a fermenter for, uh
<duMORI> cho all I GTG
<PaintSplash> That looks...awesome
<Zebranky> Getting close to a year now. I should probably drink that.
<CircuitMane> later
<rubenflonne12> take care
<gingerale> It's delicious as heck
<PaintSplash> I would eat that
<CroupDockHaunch> lol!!
<DarkMemories> Bacon, provolone, barbeque sauce, green peppers, onions, and if I'm feeling weird, chocolate sauce on top.
<Zebranky> Or bottle it or keg it.
<PaintSplash> now I am hungry
<Andromeda> German, Scottish, Irish, and Canadian... do those mix?
<DarkMemories> Oh god, now I want gyros.
<PaintSplash> are you a teenage mutant ninja turtle man?
<Zebranky> And beer in a fermenter for... seven months?
<Andromeda> DarkMemories you are now Celestia's personal chef
<DarkMemories> xD
<DarkMemories> I'm honored
<rubenflonne12> whats yours sprinkle?
<CroupDockHaunch> My mom makes completely boss umeshu
<gingerale> It comes in different forms. Inside a pocket of pita bread, with rice, garlic potatos, fries.. And then of course kebab rolls.. Rolls of that stuff and sallad wrapped inside a roll made out of of pita bread dough.
<gingerale> Best. Things. Ever.
<SirSprinkles> 6Sprinkleburg
<rubenflonne12> alright
<rememberme> gtg its 4 in the morning here
<DarkMemories> It's 4 in the morning here.
<PaintSplash> hey, its also 4 in the morning here
<Andromeda> I wonder if a food addict is reading this somewhere and... doing whatever food addicts do or something..
<DarkMemories> I'm still up.
<DarkMemories> xD
<DarkMemories> Clop?
<DSD> 4Not sure
<Andromeda> Yes.
<gingerale> One roll can weigh like an entire kilogram easily.
<DarkMemories> Oh god, THAT would be weird
<DSD> 4I like them all even the backgrounds
<Zebranky> Confound these ponies.
*DSD 4is in his sandbox working on stuff
<DarkMemories> Thoguh I guess some people are just that into ood
<Andromeda> They drive me to think crazy.
<CircuitMane> wonder what happened to Kel's career
<Outline> Meh. If you'd had the foresight to be born on the correct part of the planet, it'd be 4PM now P
<UxieLover1994> 13Your KHwiki userpages says you like Space Paranoids!
<UxieLover1994> 13:)
<CroupDockHaunch> Creme fraiche!!

<Balloons> 6pm here. xP
<CroupDockHaunch> PM
<Andromeda> I read some of the clopfics here and... I gotta say...
<DarkMemories> xD
<PaintSplash> Some ponies are just Luna ponies.
<rubenflonne12> who knows what happened to kel
<DarkMemories> Wow
<Mikey> omg
<Mikey> those balloons are awesome
<Tenaris> 4am over here
<Lambda> Thanks!
<Andromeda> Celestia and Twilight go together WAY TOO WELL...
<Mikey> derpy wants some baked bads
<Zebranky> 4 AM here too. Ow.
<CroupDockHaunch> any trumpet players in here?
<Lambda> XD
<Zebranky> I am glad this is not a weeknight.
<CircuitMane> maybe it should be movie....thing....imdb!
<CroupDockHaunch> LOL
<Lambda> I just saw that episode today
<PaintSplash> sucks though...I have to get my car worked on at 9:30...
<Lambda> on tv too!
<Lambda> not the internet!
<gingerale> Psh
<CroupDockHaunch> what's up w. it?
<DarkMemories> I play Trombone
<Andromeda> Violin
<DarkMemories> Liek a baws
<Mikey> yeah it was on this morning right??
<Isukra> 12nooo
<Mikey> :P
<Mikey> I was watching it too
<PaintSplash> I'm an amatuer guitar player, which in no way is a trumpet and doesn't help you sorry.
<Lambda> mhm
<DarkMemories> Thoguh also secondary in Euphonium/Baritone, Tuba, and Piano
<Zebranky> I mean, I overslept Wednesday night because I stayed up until 5 AM drinking Twilight Sparkle.
<Zebranky> And tequila.
<PaintSplash> Acoustic...
<Andromeda> Like a monarch
<CroupDockHaunch> @DarkMemories: Is it foolhardy to try to teach oneself a brass instrument?
<DarkMemories> Not any moreso than... Well, any other instrument.
<CroupDockHaunch> lol pro play Zebranky
<Isukra> [!Isukra vars reset]
<DarkMemories> I'm self teaching myself Cello.
<Andromeda> Octavia!
<DarkMemories> It's going quite roughly to say the least xD
<CircuitMane> Hmm, Pink Panther and pals, and battle: los angeles
<CroupDockHaunch> I know how to play just about everything on earth you don't have to blow into
<DarkMemories> Octavia plays a contrabass.
<DarkMemories> Not a cello
<CroupDockHaunch> So I figure trumpets are reasonably inexpensive
<Zebranky> CroupDockHaunch: I think I love my job. :P
<Andromeda> F*CK
<Zebranky> (thankfully I didn't have a meeting that morning)
<Andromeda> Back to fics...
<gingerale> I hope Trixie returns.. I want to see some rival yay between her and Twi. :B
<CroupDockHaunch> Why is it that 80% of RD fics have her falling from the sky?
<DarkMemories> Fanon?
<gingerale> It's easy drama
<Tenaris> How does the trixe/twilight pairing work out?
<DarkMemories> It's hawt.
<CroupDockHaunch> They're frenemies, obviously
<gingerale> Twixie is my favourite pairing
<Tenaris> i hear its for comedy
<DarkMemories> Not hot or sexy, wrong chat for that
<DarkMemories> But it's cute.
<Andromeda> Twilight, Celestia, and luna during We're Gonna Party Like 999 is hot to the point of audible giggling.
<CircuitMane> I hear a skype
<PaintSplash> They aren't so different...
<gingerale> It's just adorable ^^
<PaintSplash> I'm not sure how to phrase the rest
<SirSprinkles> 6Yeah, it just started up when I finished installing.
<CroupDockHaunch> They're sort of doppelganger versions of each other
<Ali1017> so how goes the worblegorble in here
<Tenaris> Rarely seetrixie paired with anyone else but twi only seen one and thatswith snails
<gingerale> I hope G4 ends with a movie where Twilight takes her place as the Princess of Equestria while Luna and Celestia leave to join the stars.
<Lambda> dude
<SirSprinkles> 6TIME TO WRITE
<SirSprinkles> 6AND IT FLEW REAL LOW
<Lambda> I could just stare at the screen pressing p again and again all day
<SirSprinkles> 6AND IT FLEW REAL LOW
<SirSprinkles> 6AND IT FLEW REAL LOW
<SirSprinkles> 6AND IT FLEW REAL LOW

<gingerale> Oh
<Lambda> pirates ponies pirates ponies pirates ponies pirates ponies pirates ponies pirates ponies
<CroupDockHaunch> G5 is gonna be awesome
<PaintSplash> when the show has ground out everything enjoyable based on being on too long...
<gingerale> I also ship Trixie with Fluttershy
<Tenaris> but will get a lot of movies knowing because mlp does heck of a lot of em
<Outline> G5? I can't even imagine G5.
<Mikey> play seashells
<CroupDockHaunch> It's too awesome to imagine
<gingerale> G5 will be IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
<Tenaris> My little brony friendship is epic full colt cast what a twist
<NightSeas> 12Floof
<NightSeas> 12back
<gingerale> It's like Star Trek but with ponies
<DarkMemories> No space.
<Lambda> is that a flash game?
<Andromeda> They had a th3350m3 in Celestia's bed. I thought, "*girl squeal*" after reading that part.
<Ascendant> wb
<NightSeas> 12Thanks
<Mikey> ...I was quoting mlp XD
<PaintSplash> I'd love to see them do an episode entirely with male ponies...like a backgorund group of friends.
<Andromeda> Celestia, Luna, and Twilight, that is.
<SirSprinkles> 6lol if you're talking to me I can't hear because of the stream being so loud
<Tenaris> http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/154/6/f/mlp__star_trek_by_cartoonlion-d3hz60h.png
<Mikey> IT'S UH. A BIG HOUSE.
<gingerale> Something like that, Tena
<Lambda> oh XD
<Mikey> HARRY LIKES TO COLLECT VOLLEYBALLS AND PLAY SEASHELLS
<Lambda> my bad
<Lambda> hahaha
<Lambda> forgot all about that
<Tenaris> next generation?
<CroupDockHaunch> I hope we get to see a grown up applebloom
<Andromeda> My Little Puppy: Cuteness is D'AAAAWWWWW
<gingerale> Or wait no
<Lambda> omg
<Andromeda> Side series.
<gingerale> On G5 it will be revealed that Equestria is actually a huge spaceship
<Lambda> I haven't tried actually playing the game as derpy yet
<gingerale> And sun and the moon are artificial
<Andromeda> I think it'd work out...
<Mikey> XD
<Articuno> 12^v^
<Lambda> you should see it
<eXAKR> An Articuno
<Ascendant> Heya Articuno :o
<Lambda> it's so cool with her face sliding around
<PaintSplash> In a way that like some sort of plot you don't know about is going on with the mane cast, meanwhile Bic Macintosh and others are doing stuff that the show is focusing on.
<Mikey> XDDD
<DarkMemories> @PaintSplash: Already doing that with the female CMC, I'm sure they don't want to do it with another group, especially one not beneficial to a young female audience.
*Articuno hugs all
<gingerale> Hmm..
<Isukra> 12hi
<Andromeda> Fluttershy can't NOT be in an episode.
<Lambda> I'd upload it right now so you could play
<CircuitMane> cool, skype is fun
<CircuitMane> it's what I use for my live show
<RainBroDash> AND IT FLEW REAL LOW
<Andromeda> Or else it won't be as good.
<RainBroDash> apparently
<PaintSplash> Good point
<Lambda> but it has a problem where it freezes when you win...
<DarkMemories> She wasn't in...
<RainBroDash> Skype is hella fun
<Tenaris> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/21055?search=star_trek hows about this
<DarkMemories> Hmm.
<Mikey> D:
<CroupDockHaunch> Okay how about this
<Lambda> so that would probably make your internet browser crash
<DarkMemories> Flutterdata!
<Mikey> :C
<Andromeda> Flutterborg.
<RandomlyWeir> Hayo!
<Mikey> don't worry about it
<Lambda> probably should've been focusing on that instead of on making this pony mode
<CroupDockHaunch> the entire universe is Luna's dream as she sleeps restlessly on the moon
<Lambda> BUT THAT'S NOT FUN D:
<Andromeda> Oh dear..
<Mikey> XD
<Andromeda> You shouldn't have done that.
<CroupDockHaunch> D:
<CroupDockHaunch> omg

<PaintSplash> Do you think an Equestrian Detriot would be as bad as actual Detroit?
<Tenaris> omg i sing that on my kareoke night xD
<gingerale> I don't know how bad the actual Detroit is
<AppleCider> Hola Everypony

<Tenaris> We need a ponifyed version of Guile with a american flag birthma--cutie mark on his flank
<gingerale> Heh
<ST_Falcon> You know how they exaggerate how much Cleveland and New Jersey suck?
<PaintSplash> There are entirely abandoned skyscrapers...it is fallout.
<DSD> 4and theres the ending
<Zebranky> ST_Falcon: New Jersey hurts.
<gingerale> That's pretty cool but I wouldn't visit it ^^
<Zebranky> Every time I drive through it
<ST_Falcon> There's two places they're NOT exaggerating about.
<Zebranky> It hurts.
<PaintSplash> On youtube theres urban explorer vids of detroit
<ST_Falcon> Detroit, and Miami.
<rubenflonne12> hehe take care circuit
<gingerale> If I knew parkour I'd visit the town :B
<DarkMemories> Wut.

<Zebranky> And we can't grow in this cold

*Articuno goes to Pokedex entries

<gingerale> Oh wait
<RainBroDash> D:
<Ghosties> 4Hah, yes, that is true. You're almost in every thread I lurk in
<Apokalipse> I just lurked on ponychan once. Two weeks ago actually, which is when I heard about this
<Zebranky> I ordered Rock Band 3 and the keyboard peripheral for 360
<RainBroDash> Stream be over?
<PaintSplash> this is where it gets spotty...theres chorus under the lyric
<DarkMemories> Hungry ponies, they will buy them, caramel apples apple sweets

<RandomlyWeir> thanks

<Zebranky> SPINNIN' ROUND AND HAVING KICKS

<Zebranky> THEY'LL SHOWER US WITH DIAMONDS
<Balloons> Not you. Zebranky
<Apokalipse> hello, is anyone still here?
<Zebranky> THE WONDERBOLTS WILL SEE ME RIGHT HERE AT THE GALA!
<Zebranky> And yes, I do.
<PaintSplash> All we've longed, for all we've dreamed, our happy ever-after. Finally will all come true here at the Grand Gala!
<DarkMemories> All we've longed for, all we've dreamed, our happy ever-after... Finally will all come true, right here at the Grand Gala!
<Zebranky> It's Rainbow Dash.
<DarkMemories> Dammit
<RainBroDash> NO
<PaintSplash> at the Gala!
<DarkMemories> I'm here at the Gran Gala,
<PaintSplash> I thought we were switching back
<RainBroDash> I IS NOT
<Apokalipse> aww
<Apokalipse> disappoint
<DarkMemories> For it is the best party!
<RainBroDash> ikr :(
<DarkMemories> But one thing it was missing was a pony named Pinkie!
<DarkMemories> For I am the best at parties, all the ponies will agree
<Apokalipse> wish you were here brony
<Ascendant> nope, one of my servers
<DarkMemories> Ponies playing, ponies dancing,
<DarkMemories> With me at the Grand Gala!~
<Zebranky> Happiness and laughter at the Gala, at the Gala
<PaintSplash> Happiness and laughter at the Gala.
<Ascendant> decided on debian 6 64-bit
*DarkMemories cues Twilight
<NightSeas> 12Ah
<PaintSplash> At the Gala, with the Princess, Is where I'm going to be.
<Zebranky> At the Gala with the Princess is where I'm going to be
*DarkMemories cues Twilight frantically
<NightSeas> 1264-bit always wins over 32
*DarkMemories canes a random one off the stage
<Zebranky> We will talk all about magic and what I've learned and seen
<PaintSplash> We will talk all about magic, and what I've learned and seen.
*DarkMemories realizes it fine, one is the chorus xP
<Zebranky> It is going to be so special as she takes time just for meeeeeee~
<Ascendant> yeah
<Ascendant> but 64 has issues sometimes
<PaintSplash> THIS WILL BE THE BEST NIGHT EVER!
<Ascendant> I'm only using unreal and ZNC on this anyway
<DarkMemories> To meet
<DarkMemories> To sell
<DarkMemories> To find
<DarkMemories> To prove
<Ascendant> so it doesn't matter
<Zebranky> Into the Gala we must go we're ready now we're all aglow
<Ascendant> at least it's not centos
<DarkMemories> To woo
<RainBroDash> <3
<DarkMemories> To talk
<Zebranky> Dammit
<DarkMemories> Into the Gala
<PaintSplash> This didn't go well
<DarkMemories> Into the Gala~,
<Zebranky> FINE
<DarkMemories> Better than that Mumble performance.
<DarkMemories> Oh god that failed.
<Zebranky> Into the Gala!
<Zebranky> Into the Gala!
<gingerale> Pfft xD http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/9acaabd37c8f0b50f17f95372ce0acce/25564%20-%20Nightmare_Moon.png
<PaintSplash> and We'll have the BEST NIGHT EVER!
<Zebranky> AT THE GALA!
<eXAKR> http://yattarosb.deviantart.com/art/The-Grasshole-Show-7-213669445
<DarkMemories> If I didn't have a low voice, I would totally cover that song.
<DarkMemories> xD
<eXAKR> ^----
<DarkMemories> I'm a good singer, but... I'm stuck in the nether regions of the bass clef
<Zebranky> Yeah, I can't actually pull it off. I like to think I can sing, but my range is... limited.
<Hamcha> Greetings Everypony
*Zebranky brohoof
<DarkMemories> I can do treble, but it starts getting a little to falsetto
<Hamcha> ..am i the only one that has tiramisù for breakfast?
<PaintSplash> I have a range I have to sing in, or I crackle...Like...Jonathan coulton range but ni higher
<Zebranky> Exactly.
<DarkMemories> Let's just say...
<DarkMemories> I sing like Rick Astley.
<PaintSplash> I had a teramisu cake pop a little while ago
<DarkMemories> xD
<eXAKR> I think I will shove that into drf's face later
<PaintSplash> Sort of been rickrolled...I think
<DarkMemories> Well, it's not my fault you thought of it
<PaintSplash> when I hear his name, I think the song...therefor you got me
<DarkMemories> You didn't have to think about Never gonna Give You Up
<Zebranky> Now, seriously
<Sneas> 03o.o
<DarkMemories> He has others songs, it's just they're more obscure, so you probably haven't heard of them.
<Zebranky> Can you tell me with a straight face that Rainbow Dash *doesn't* sing in all caps?
<DarkMemories> I listen to Rick Astley before he went manestream
<DarkMemories> Yes.
<PaintSplash> I was born the year Never gonna give you up was top of the charts....
<Ascendant> crap
<DarkMemories> xD
<Ascendant> I forgot how to change the hostname
<Zebranky> I hear your opinion and promptly discard it.
<DarkMemories> At least that was when pop was good
<peabnuts123> POST
<PaintSplash> Music is unfortunate now
<DarkMemories> Well, sorta, as good as pop could be
<peabnuts123> We're talking about music?
<DarkMemories> Yes, quite.
<DarkMemories> And... yes, quite.
<PaintSplash> we just got there
<peabnuts123> I'm listening to Black Album on Record right now.
<DarkMemories> We tried sing-a-long-ing At The Gala.
<DarkMemories> But it faile.d
<DarkMemories> No miserably, but if failed.
<peabnuts123> aww
<PaintSplash> I watched get him to the greek, and the music from the fake band "Infant Sorrow" was better than todays music.
<peabnuts123> Todays music is not BAD... I enjoy some
<peabnuts123> But nothing is GREAT
<Zebranky> Still: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEbFXzZiuG8
<Zebranky> This is going to happen.
<Zebranky> With bronies.
<gingerale> Volbeat is GREAT
<gingerale> And it's today's music
<DarkMemories> I would totally perform that live
<DarkMemories> xD
<DarkMemories> And sing lead if they'd let me
<DarkMemories> My pitch sucks when I have allergies, like right now
<DarkMemories> but I'm quite good after clearing my throat and warming up xP
<gingerale> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEN3mQ0ql30 <3
<peabnuts123> heh, Volbeat.
<gingerale> See?
<PaintSplash> I was my friends rockband frontman....I was the best singer out of 10 people...plus I was bad with the instruments.
<gingerale> Today's music and it's great
<Ascendant> ohsi
<Ascendant> ohai*
<peabnuts123> Only because it's based on Pokemon
<lightumbreon|mibbit> hi
<DarkMemories> I got a woman's deodorant commercial.
<Ascendant> !fight lightumbreon|mibbit
*ScriptBot uses Air Cutter on lightumbreon|mibbit! lightumbreon|mibbit loses 151 HP! lightumbreon|mibbit has 849 HP left!
<Ascendant> !chatstats
<Cone> Chat stats updating.
<gingerale> Dark? What the heck are you watching? xD
<DarkMemories> Something tells me I've been watching too much MLP.
<PaintSplash> maybe you haven't heard manestream music....I can't listen to 106.1 without wanting to puncture my eardrums
<DarkMemories> xP
<gingerale> But
<Articuno> 12OMG that took AGES >v>
<gingerale> Volbeat is mainstream
<DarkMemories> Music is like candy bars
<Zebranky> ... since when?
<Articuno> 12The code on that page was SO badly written and messy
<DarkMemories> It's better once you throw out the wrappers
<PaintSplash> I don't think they play that on 106
<Zebranky> This is the first time I've heard this song
<Articuno> 12I had to clean it all up first
<peabnuts123> I am kinda sick of music for the most pasrt
<peabnuts123> part
<gingerale> Since they got sold out whenever they play live?
<PaintSplash> I'm talking about what the dregs listen too...
<peabnuts123> I listen to my WHOLE library on shuffle
<DarkMemories> I like instrumental music
<Zebranky> And I pop between, uh...
<peabnuts123> and my library is mostly POKEMON BGM or YTMND THE SOUNDTRACK
<peabnuts123> so, not music
<DarkMemories> And J-Pop, but that's a different xtory from my weaboo times xD
<PaintSplash> lol
<peabnuts123> So really; I will listen to anything
<Zebranky> Five or six stations when I'm driving
<gingerale> DarkMemories: Where did you get advertisement like that? xD
<gingerale> The deodorant thing
<DarkMemories> Pokemon music is not BGM?
<PaintSplash> I've a split between classic/brit rock, and Game stuff.
<DarkMemories> Before the YT vid of that song.
<DarkMemories> I mean, Pokemon BGM is not music?
<PaintSplash> and some MLP stuff...
<Ascendant> lmfao
<DarkMemories> It's plenty sure music
<peabnuts123> It's BGM and then... WEIRD HIGH PITCHED JAPANESE STUFF
<Ascendant> probably not as bad as mine
<Zebranky> Give me either good vocals or *really* good instrumentals and I'm in.
<DarkMemories> It's hella good instrumental music.
<peabnuts123> I don't think you've heard about 90% of the pokemon music I have
<peabnuts123> lol
<PaintSplash> I don't have winter wrap up...but it never grew on me that much...compared to like Art of the dress, or At the gala...
<Zebranky> I loves me a Dream Theater.
<DarkMemories> Wut?
<DarkMemories> Unless it's not from the games.
<peabnuts123> Dream Theater <3
<peabnuts123> it's not from the games.
<DarkMemories> I have all the game music.
<PaintSplash> I know...I know, Heresy
<Zebranky> peabnuts123: ^5
<peabnuts123> Not a single sing
<DarkMemories> The anime?
<peabnuts123> high fives
<peabnuts123> yes
<DarkMemories> xD
<peabnuts123> and it's mostly the japanese anime
<gingerale> Oh yeah
<Zebranky> BROHOOF
<peabnuts123> and live shows and stuff
<DarkMemories> Well, the game music is music
<DarkMemories> And good music
<peabnuts123> The game music is AWESOME
<Hamcha> peabnuts123: i have nearly all the songs from all the sonic games
<Hamcha> beat that.
<gingerale> The list of bands playing downtown during a weekend in about month http://www.tuska-festival.fi/?sivu=esiintyjat
<gingerale> ^^
<peabnuts123> Hmm
<gingerale> Right here downtown
<peabnuts123> I doubt I could beat that
<PaintSplash> I have the soundtracks to sonic 1-3 and knuckles on my Ipod
<peabnuts123> But I have... all of.. the YTMND soundtrack?
<PaintSplash> and I am nerd shamed
<Zebranky> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3UT8bfp0ow
<peabnuts123> I have a shit tonne of Powerpuff Girls music on my phone
<peabnuts123> That's pretty cool
<Hamcha> oh my, i was beaten hard
<Hamcha> :|
<Zebranky> And then http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3pKByy53JY
<Ascendant> argh damnit, this thing is making me set up IPv6
*Ascendant bawwwwwwwwwws
<peabnuts123> Octavarium is a masterpiece
<peabnuts123> But I listen to Six Degrees more
<peabnuts123> (like every day)
<Zebranky> That live performance is absolutely *spectacular*
<peabnuts123> yea
<Zebranky> peabnuts123: They did all of Six Degrees at that show too.
<peabnuts123> Hah
<peabnuts123> I know, man
<Zebranky> (the suite, anyway)
<peabnuts123> I have the album
<DarkMemories> Well, while I'm still thinking about BGM, I gotta say that these two BGMs are among my favorites of all time:
<DarkMemories> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNvHGXbdO5I http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfgZOTuu6J0
<peabnuts123> Funnily enough
<Zebranky> Good, just checking ;)
<peabnuts123> The Record I'm listening to now
<peabnuts123> I went to go looking for Dream Theater Vinyls today
<peabnuts123> I didn't have a lot of time so I could only check 1 store
<peabnuts123> They didn't have any DT; but they did have Black Album for pretty cheap
<EpicStatsGuy> 12Meowing Lugia = THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!
<Zebranky> I went through a phase where I gathered every DT bootleg and B-side I could from the internets
<peabnuts123> So DT is the reason I'm listening to this right now
<peabnuts123> Oh god lol
<Zebranky> There is some really obscure, *really* awesome stuff.
<peabnuts123> haha
<DarkMemories> hipster much?
<peabnuts123> I can never ever be fucked looking for B sides
<Zebranky> I think my favorite obscure track is Kevin Moore's demo of Space Dye Vest.
<DarkMemories> >implying that the word obscure automatically means hipster
<Articuno> 12Articuno page is done ^^
<Zebranky> Where it was just him singing and playing piano (and his samples)
<peabnuts123> Cool man
<Hamcha> Nothing beats Propaganda from Beyond Good & Evil
<Hamcha> ù_U
<Zebranky> Lemme put that up...
<peabnuts123> I have Dream Theater's discography like a good little Pirate
<peabnuts123> But I admit
<peabnuts123> I haven't made it around all their albums yet
<peabnuts123> They have like
<peabnuts123> 9001 hours of music
<peabnuts123> I calculated their average song length
<Ascendant> nice :3
<peabnuts123> It was narly 9 minutes e_e
<PaintSplash> I always took hipster to be wearing and doing things to be ironic.
<Armageddon> heya
<peabnuts123> Even without Six Degrees on Score
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Hey
<Articuno> 12Now for the Lugia page >v>
<Zebranky> Oh, and the demo for "A Change of Seasons" (which was originally supposed to be on Images and Words)? Beautiful.
<PaintSplash> Like when I watched scott pilgrim, I culd best describe as a film for guys who wear game shirts, and hats but don't know anything about the games themselves.
<gingerale> Hahahahahahahaa, I hadn't seen this one before xD http://ponibooru.413chan.net/post/view/25312
<Zebranky> That was while they were auditioning other singers.
<peabnuts123> lol
<gingerale> So awesome
<peabnuts123> Scott Pilgrim is supposed to be good?
<peabnuts123> You know what's ironic in a hipster sense
<DarkMemories> @PaintSplash: Yeah, same.
<peabnuts123> Big Bang Theory.
<Sam_Vimes> Anyone home?
<peabnuts123> Heya Sam
<DarkMemories> There weren't enoguh actual game reference IMO, rather than just game cliches >.>
<gingerale> Big crunch, heck yeah!
<PaintSplash> Plus most of the characters were cnsistently unlikeable
<peabnuts123> Man
<peabnuts123> I do not understand Scott Pilgrim
<PaintSplash> but what do I know, I watched Avatar for the story...not the experience...and disliked it immensely.
<DarkMemories> xD
<peabnuts123> I heard about it first when that film came out
<DarkMemories> Welcome back to Pocahontas
<peabnuts123> I need to watch it; it's supposed to be good
<Sam_Vimes> I hated Avatar.
<peabnuts123> But then I find it it's like... a comic...
<Ascendant> bloody hell, I hate setting up IPv6
<peabnuts123> But it's drawn like a web comic
<peabnuts123> I don't even
<Ascendant> it's always such a pain
<DarkMemories> I liked the visuals and concepts in that regard.
<Sam_Vimes> Only thing it's good at is the 3D.
<peabnuts123> Sam
<peabnuts123> gtfo
<peabnuts123> I kid
<PaintSplash> I think the guy who made Scott Pilgrim...sold his sole to get fame...
<peabnuts123> But seriously
<PaintSplash> *soul
<calvindapanda> lalalaalaa
<DarkMemories> The story was really jsut generic though.
<peabnuts123> What isn't, man
<Sam_Vimes> Cameron could've done better with it, really.
<Apokalipse> indeed
<peabnuts123> Films today are generally boring
<peabnuts123> In idea
<PaintSplash> indeed, that was my issue
<peabnuts123> They are quite watchable
<PaintSplash> I can't wear 3d specs...I get sick
<calvindapanda> yes
<Articuno> 12Why? ovO
<calvindapanda> so
<calvindapanda> yeah
<peabnuts123> but there hasn't been a classic film in a while now
<calvindapanda> whats up
<calvindapanda> all 2 of you
<DarkMemories> MLP:FiM has no really original plots, I may add.
<PaintSplash> and the story was so 2D
<DarkMemories> But they're entertaining at least.
<DarkMemories> Unlike most other things.
<DarkMemories> xP
<Apokalipse> nothing much
<peabnuts123> 3d is such a gimmick and I continue to boycott it
<ST_Falcon> There are no original plots anymore.
<Zebranky> peabnuts123: http://www.mercuric.net/tmp/Dream_Theater_-_Uncovered_-_13_-_Space_Dye_Vest.mp3
<DarkMemories> Well, I have to go for a week.
<Apokalipse> Watching boast busters
<DarkMemories> Goodbye, everypony!
<peabnuts123> I like Avatar, it was really pretty; but it was just a closetFur plot
<Apokalipse> :D
<ST_Falcon> We ran out of those like 3000 years ago.
<Zebranky> Really quiet. You have to crank it up.
<peabnuts123> Bye DarkMemories ;_;
<PaintSplash> Well...being creative is telling the same story in such a new and different way people don't notice its the same
<DarkMemories> I'll miss every one of you. Well... most of you.
<DarkMemories> xP
<DarkMemories> Bai
<peabnuts123> lolcats
<peabnuts123> bye
<Zebranky> But one of the most obscure, and maybe one of the most haunting DT tracks you'll ever hear.
<PaintSplash> bye
<peabnuts123> I can't Zbranky
<Apokalipse> Because my brain is full of pony!
<peabnuts123> My vinyl is playing lol
<calvindapanda> oh nice
<Articuno> 12ovO
<peabnuts123> I'll tab it
<drf|away> 03what
<Zebranky> Well, save it and listen later :P
<drf|away> 03I just rebooted my desktop
<drf|away> 03now I'm going to bed
<calvindapanda> YAY
<calvindapanda> :D
<Articuno> 12LOL
<drf|away> 03the fan I had in here originally sounded like a jet engine was taking off
<peabnuts123> I thought the Sci-fi elements in Avatar were cool
<gingerale> http://scans-daily.dreamwidth.org/3055836.html xD
<drf|away> 03I was like no, and shut it down
<ST_Falcon> the problem is that sullivan didn't do his fucking job
<gingerale> Read it!
<Apokalipse> also browsing the picasa page me and a few other bronies made on a forum
<drf|away> 03trying liquid cooling and having bad luck with it :/
<Sam_Vimes> I EAT YOUR SANDWICHES
<Sam_Vimes> I EAT EM ALL
<calvindapanda> cool
<peabnuts123> oh man
<peabnuts123> SO LONG
<peabnuts123> My modern day attention span is too short for this comic
<Apokalipse> mhm. Ponies everywhere! The forum is about Gran turismo the video game
<Articuno> 12Fans always put me to sleep
<PaintSplash> yes but the characters were so cookie cutter...
<Ascendant> lmfao
<drf|away> 03want these ones then? They sound like a roaring engine
<Articuno> 12probably because they drowned out all the noise my parents used to make past 11pm >v>
<peabnuts123> So?
<PaintSplash> Big bad americans, entirely peaceful natives
<Ascendant> Well Articuno, have you ever tried setting up IPv6?
<Articuno> 12Nah, I don't keep my computer in my room anymore
<peabnuts123> What isn't these days?
<Articuno> 12Ascendant, no
<peabnuts123> I can't say that makes it right
<PaintSplash> Ever see Red letter Medias avartar review?
<peabnuts123> But it's wrong to expert quality from anything
<PaintSplash> that pretty much says it all
<ST_Falcon> You can't have depth in this economy!
<Apokalipse> 3671 replies since may 5th
<Ascendant> heh well, depending on whether you have a native block or not, it gets really annoying
<prince-dari> You here Sprikles? Just got back.
<peabnuts123> This is a controversial film for some reason
<peabnuts123> but I think one of the only classics of recent times is something like Watchmen
<Ascendant> if you don't have a native block you have to set up your connection to tunnel through something like he.net, configure your router to allow ICMP pings, etc. and then route a lot of stuff for it to work
<Apokalipse> Sprinkles hasn't been talking, so I guess no
<peabnuts123> and I never read the novel
<Isukra> 12o-o
<ST_Falcon> Also, the point of Scott Pilgrim is that Scott IS a douchebag. He is a complete dickhole.
<Umbreon> 12RAWR
<Ascendant> if you have a native block, you have to configure your interfaces for it to work
<Umbreon> 12LugiaLordOfTheSeas
<Umbreon> 12what's the rules for rebirthing in mabi?
<peabnuts123> Hence Michael Cera?
<Ascendant> and because this VPS hasn't properly assigned me a block, they screwed up and now I'm going ffffffffff
<ST_Falcon> The comics go much more in depth with this, obviously.
<PaintSplash> But pretty much everyone was
<PaintSplash> in the film
<peabnuts123> The comics are weird; man
<Umbreon> 12how often can you do it
<peabnuts123> It's like a webcomic
<peabnuts123> But published to paper for some reason
<ST_Falcon> Yep.
<peabnuts123> -has a problem with this-
<PaintSplash> I like Comic stories...but I can't comment on Pilgrim...
<PaintSplash> I never read the books...
<PaintSplash> Don't really want too though
<ST_Falcon> whatevs.
<Ascendant> I also swear it's not native and it's being tunnelled through he.net, but maybe I'm just doing it wrong
<Apokalipse> sooo
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Once a week (with cards) and free rebirth at the age of 21
<Apokalipse> how's everyone doing?
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> or 20 can't really remember that well XD
<PaintSplash> the only book I can say I now I'd hate...is Twilight.
<peabnuts123> Zebranky
<Zebranky> peabnuts123
<peabnuts123> Do Dream Theater release anything on Vinyl?
<PaintSplash> but thats lit, not comic
<Articuno> 12THREE WEEKS TILL LUGIA AND HAWKIE GET HERE XD
<Zebranky> Not that I know of.
<Zebranky> Lots of really limited CD releases.
<peabnuts123> I know I bought an massive super edition of an album for a friend
<Umbreon> 1220
<Umbreon> 12LugiaLordOfTheSeas
<peabnuts123> It had a record in it I'm sure
<Ascendant> :o
<Zebranky> And http://liftingshadows.com/
<eXAKR> AWESOME
<Umbreon> 12i thought that you can rebirth after every saturday at 2PM
<Umbreon> 128PM your time
<prince-dari> Welp, that was fun.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> neat
<peabnuts123> Oh ncie
<gingerale> I just got hte best idea
<peabnuts123> ice
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Nope once a week
<peabnuts123> NICE*
<peabnuts123> fff
<peabnuts123> what?
<Umbreon> 12so once every 7 days
<JackiePie> Hi
<gingerale> Ponified.. wait for it.. Buck. Rogers.
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> Yes
<Ascendant> Okay, maybe it is right
<Umbreon> 12great then i'm stuck a girl for longer than i thought x-x

<JackiePie> Awesome
<peabnuts123> Ah; I never watched it...
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> XD
*Ascendant rages for the sake of raging anyway
<RainBroDash> GR8
<JackiePie> I know it's sci-fi from my parents generation.
<Armageddon> !check ho-ohrealm.net
<Apokalipse> awesome
<JackiePie> *jamming to Lady Gaga*
<peabnuts123> Lady Gaga <3
<Apokalipse> Who's going to be here for the re-broadcast at 7pm GMT?
<Zebranky> Dammit. Now I wish I had bought the original edition of Lifting Shadows.
<JackiePie> Did you know she released the video for Edge of Glory on her website.
<RainBroDash> memememe
<PaintSplash> I gotta go to sleep...night everypony....Or rather good morning
<JackiePie> night
<Apokalipse> awesome!
<ST_Falcon> Hating Twilight means that you're sane.
<JackiePie> Book or pony?
<ST_Falcon> Book, duh.
<JackiePie> lol
<JackiePie> Have you seen the movie Vampires Suck?
<ST_Falcon> No.
<JackiePie> It makes fun out of the Twilight series, and has vampires speeding around on Segways.
<Apokalipse> I wonder how many people will be there. Probably not as many as there are for the normal stream
<peabnuts123> I can't say I've watched Twilight
<peabnuts123> Nothing can be that good; but I can't really comment on it until then
<ST_Falcon> peabnuts: keep it that way.
<peabnuts123> Not even FiM is THAT GOOD.
<peabnuts123> I have at least 2 of the films on my Hard Drive
<JackiePie> You should watch Vampires SUck
<peabnuts123> Maybe one day I'll see them

<Balloons> Nothing much. Rather quiet here.
<peabnuts123> i'm half op? Okay.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> LOLINUX
<lightumbreon|mibbit> xD
<Ascendant> linux is awesome lol
<Ascendant> but
<Ascendant> >case sensitive
<Ascendant> mfw
<Balloons> Not alot of mods on atm peabnuts123. You will help right?
<peabnuts123> Sure, man
<Ascendant> I get errors just because I forgot to capitalize an a or something
<Balloons> Thanks
<peabnuts123> I got nothing much to do
<Ali1017> woo
<lightumbreon|mibbit> ew....
<JackiePie> There are more ponies in #EquestriaAfterDark
<Ali1017> i know
<Ascendant> oh crap
<Ascendant> forgot to install openssl dev
<Ascendant> oh and it's debian, need to install build-essentials too
<lightumbreon|mibbit> :/
<Ascendant> but debian is still awesome anyway
<Ascendant> debian > ubuntu
<eXAKR> How so?
<Ascendant> ubuntu is bloated
<Ascendant> has a ton of stuff that doesn't need to be installed
<Ascendant> it's basically just debian with extra features that aren't needed
<calvindapanda> apokalipse
<calvindapanda> hi
<calvindapanda> http://kyrospawn.deviantart.com/art/MLP-FIM-soundboard-V2-1-213310684
<calvindapanda> take this
<eXAKR> Hmmm
<eXAKR> It really depends on what you need and how you define bloated
<eXAKR> anyway bbl going to the library
<lightumbreon|mibbit> bye
<Apokalipse> ooooh
<Apokalipse> I saw a previous version of that soundboard. This one has more stuff to click!
<Apokalipse> Trixie quotes... sweet
<Ascendant> ubuntu is slow

<peabnuts123> Recruiting
<TurniBrony> Oh hey. There's still people here.
<TurniBrony> o/
<Apokalipse> yup
<Apokalipse> it's pretty dead though
<Isukra> 12Espeon~
<TurniBrony> Well. I can ressurect it
<Apokalipse> good luck with that
<Apokalipse> Were you here for the movie night?
<TurniBrony> Wololo lolo
<TurniBrony> Yes.

<NightSeas> 12Floof~
<TurniBrony> Yes.
<Apokalipse> neat. I had to go after Alladin
<Espeon> 06:3
<TurniBrony> Well. Ok, I skipped Dragonshy.
*Espeon floofs
<Apokalipse> I needed to sleep
<Apokalipse> because that's kind of important
<TurniBrony> Sleep is for the weak.
<TurniBrony> Starship Troopers was great.
<Apokalipse> I'll see if I can catch it during the re-broadcast
<TurniBrony> Then people mentioned Robocop in the chat. So I watched that afterwards.
<Ascendant> wat.
<TurniBrony> =b
<TurniBrony> Certainly wouldn't mind seeing it again.
<Apokalipse> yeah robocop is awesome
<Apokalipse> he's like a robot... and a cop... he's also bad ass
<TurniBrony> I got kind of mistyeyed over the stuff with his wife and all that.
<NightSeas> 12c:
<Apokalipse> I haven't actually watched robocop much
<TurniBrony> I kind of remember there being a TV show too. But don't remember if it was all that good or not.
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Drake02)03WB* - <Lyon> 04I hate you all
<Apokalipse> no idea...
<Apokalipse> I bet as long as there is a robot that is a cop and is also bad ass it's good
<Ascendant> wb Drake
<prince-dari> I might go get some sleep, I didn't get much last night, and we danced for hours.
<prince-dari> BBL
<NightSeas> 12Well, good night everyone
<TurniBrony> Maybe.
<Apokalipse> I'm pretty excited for next weeks movie
<Apokalipse> Seven
<K2a7s9m> ohai
<TurniBrony> Yeah. It's pretty good.
<Apokalipse> Even though I've seen it plenty of times
<TurniBrony> I'd go for Fight Club myself over Seven though.
<Apokalipse> I gotta go now
<Apokalipse> cya brony
<TurniBrony> Forever a pone. :<
<Armageddon> ohai K2a7s9m

<lightumbreon|mibbit> ohai Espeon
<Drake> 04...Another weird-ass dream?
<TurniBrony> I am so gonna draw mustaches on your faces
<Armageddon> Wasn't that weird
<Armageddon> but we did get kidnapped
<Drake> 04o-o
<Drake> 04Why?
<Espeon> 06Armageddon your dreams seem quite interesting
<Espeon> 06That is all
<LugiaLordOfTheSeas> XD

<SirSprinkles> 6I see you.
<SirSprinkles> 6*stare*
<TurniBrony> o/
<TurniBrony> Glad to see someone's alive.
<SirSprinkles> 6Only until I can sleep later.
<calvindapanda> yay
<SirSprinkles> 6Post-show went SO LATE.
<calvindapanda> people are aliveee
<TurniBrony> I thought the bugs got all of you.
<SirSprinkles> 6Nope.
<SirSprinkles> 6Killed them all.
<SirSprinkles> 6With my lag.
<TurniBrony> The only good lag is a dead lag.
<TurniBrony> Chat made up for the lag though.
<TurniBrony> That and the tank bugs.
<SirSprinkles> 6I still have no idea why it was lagging.
<TurniBrony> Time to replace the Packard Bell computer
<SirSprinkles> 6It's a Compaq...
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just... ew...
<TurniBrony> Time to get a chip in it that isn't crunchy.
<SirSprinkles> 6But it likes potato chips.
<SirSprinkles> 6As do I.
<TurniBrony> See? You give it junk food and eventually it will slow down.
<SirSprinkles> 6Nonsense.
<SirSprinkles> 6Just more carbs to keep it running.
<TurniBrony> Couldn't handle all the 1337 bugs.
<SirSprinkles> 6...I'm hungry now...
<SirSprinkles> 6THANKS
<User_4707> YOU
<TurniBrony> ;D
<TurniBrony> So. Looking forward to the next B movie? ;P
<SirSprinkles> 6I haven't really looked into it.
<TurniBrony> Saw alittle of it on YT.
<TurniBrony> Brace for awful.
<TurniBrony> Not even sure I wanna watch it. :x
<NightmareMoon> Me?
<Isukra> 12hi floofy
<TurniBrony> But Seven will be a good time.
<SirSprinkles> 6I expect next week to be quite odd.

<Hamcha> As Cave Johnson said, science is not about "WHY?", but it's about "WHY NOT?"

<peabnuts123> as a scientist I would prefer to know what was causing them
<peabnuts123> and what the results say about the situation
<peabnuts123> I can't prove anything to be impossible... well. very little.
<peabnuts123> you*
<Hamcha> but there are too many variables, in a situation like that, i would act like the church did all those years
<Hamcha> if you can't control it, destroy it
<Hamcha> or at least say it's faulty
<Ascendant> :3
<Kerrus> If you can't control it, banish it to the moon for a thousand years
<Hamcha> that worked for 2000 years, why would it work now?
<Kerrus> well, what's changed?
<Kerrus> find out what's changed, and banish that to the moon
<Hamcha> Still
<peabnuts123> There aren't that many variables
<Hamcha> Recent researches discovered that there's a portal stuck on the moon
<peabnuts123> You could pretty easily test for causality
<Kerrus> pony rights activists? Moon. Pony rebeliion? Moon. Sister trying to make the world into eternal night? Moon.
<Hamcha> so it's too risky to banish someone there
<Hamcha> as there would be a way to run away
<peabnuts123> Yea, why didn't Luna just escape through Aperture Science
<peabnuts123> No doubt GLaDOS closed the portal afterwards
<Kerrus> she tried, but Wheatly getting ejected through the portal klonked her on he head
<Pearly> ugh, darnit

<peabnuts123> It's all done by one girl, lol
<peabnuts123> excpet for
<peabnuts123> 2 people
<Evolution212> It is better than others I have seen.
<peabnuts123> That
<peabnuts123> Knights of Canterlot guy makes fricken hilarious clips
<peabnuts123> And he did an episode
<peabnuts123> But it was a different kind of humour
<peabnuts123> This was probably the best Abridged episode I've seen
<Free> I remember that.
<Free> It's the only one that actually made me laugh out loud.

<peabnuts123> asiodguyhjaskld;
<Shaico> wtf i hate phineas and ferb
<Shaico> do not mention that show
<peabnuts123> Dude
<peabnuts123> That show is awesome.
<Evolution212> What's bad about it?
<peabnuts123> regardless
<peabnuts123> The guys who did the cover
<peabnuts123> are amazing
<peabnuts123> http://www.youtube.com/user/Arraitchgee
<Shaico> it's that type of show that you can obviously tell when you should be laughing, but aren't
<Shaico> idk it just bothers me that much
<peabnuts123> Phineas and Ferb isn't a funny show really... it's just awesome
<peabnuts123> They make awesome stuff
<Shaico> it relies on the jokes and not the actual character developement
<Evolution212> Alright. I've never seen.
<Evolution212> seen it*
<peabnuts123> And they have ridiculously quality music
<Shaico> ok i admit their music is decent
*Free likes Phineas & Ferb.
<peabnuts123> check it out
<peabnuts123> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwf86ndqsBs&feature=channel_video_title

<peabnuts123> Lol
<peabnuts123> It's just lolrandom
<Shaico> yeah that's the word
<Shaico> too random
<Shaico> Not pinkie random
<peabnuts123> Ah well; I enjoy it
<peabnuts123> It's certainly shining out in the rest of television these days
*Evolution212 points at the infinitely brighter light of ponies.
<Shaico> that much is true
<Shaico> the crap on TV now
<peabnuts123> So much
<Shaico> if i ever see another unoriginal drama/action tv show, i'll barf
<peabnuts123> Lolol
<Shaico> or another pointless and unfunny cartoon
<peabnuts123> I have to admit
<peabnuts123> THe tv on nowadays is; nothing on what we used to have
<peabnuts123> but if you're bored and it's just on
<peabnuts123> I can watch it
<Shaico> yeah TV has that effect
<peabnuts123> lol
<Shaico> isn't something you really even think about. you just... watch it
<Evolution212> Ren and Stimpy, anyone?
<Shaico> yes
<Shaico> that and Dexter's Lab
<Shaico> oh my god i loved Dexter's Lab <3
<peabnuts123> It's been a couple of New Year's Eve's now we all just have Disney Channel or Nickelodeon on in the background
<Evolution212> I only saw one episode of Dexter's Lab. It was hilarious.
<peabnuts123> Dexter's Lab was amazing
<Shaico> Nostalgia for my age
<peabnuts123> Totally
<peabnuts123> Wow
<peabnuts123> Did you see that Celestia cosplay on ED?
<Shaico> yeah i saw.
<Shaico> man she's beautiful
<Shaico> perfect for celestia
<Shaico> next up, Luna
<peabnuts123> That is amazing
<Fassad_McDuck> *munch*
<Shaico> i just had an idea
<Shaico> im gonna paint my guitar light blue
<Shaico> and add RD's cutiemark on it
<Shaico> wooooo
<Evolution212> I don't think it would matter who cosplayed Luna, I'd still break my monitor from hugging it.
<peabnuts123> Totally
<peabnuts123> Man
<peabnuts123> Do it
<Shaico> once i do it, i'm gonna go ahead and send it to Seth
<Armageddon> Altair should be back soon
<peabnuts123> Did you ever see that picture of RBD with the Flying V guitar
<Shaico> yeah i saved it
<Shaico> it was my display pic for a while now
<peabnuts123> If only I had a V...
<peabnuts123> But they are impossible to play -_-
<peabnuts123> BUT IT'D BE WORTH IT
<Shaico> yeah the shape is for show off-y reasons
<Evolution212> They'd be hard to sit in your lap, at least.
<Shaico> i'd rather play my SG
<Shaico> what guitar you own?
<Armageddon> ohai Darklust
<peabnuts123> It's a cool shape but
<peabnuts123> I don't want to ALWAYS STAND UP while playing
<peabnuts123> Um
<peabnuts123> Okay; you know explorers?
<peabnuts123> or... X-plorer or W/E...
<peabnuts123> and you know how... fender have like a fake version with a similar shape..
<Shaico> yeah i know the explorer
<peabnuts123> Well I have a knock-off of the fake fender :p
<Shaico> well dayum
<peabnuts123> But I have a really nice acoustic guitar
<Shaico> fake fake fender explorer?
<peabnuts123> semi-acoustic
<peabnuts123> Yea lolol
<peabnuts123> and also a cheap acoustic guitar
<Shaico> lol almost the exact same here
<peabnuts123> My instrument collection is; erratic at best
<Shaico> Epiphone SG Special guitar, Semi Acoustic APX guitar, and a nylon guitar
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> I have an Ibanez electric
<Shaico> what type of Ibanez Muffin?
<peabnuts123> Nice, guys xD
<peabnuts123> My semi-acoustic is Ibanez
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> http://www.dv247.com/assets/products/38277_l.jpg <This one
<Shaico> both acoustics and semi acoustics i own is Yamaha loo
<peabnuts123> nice 8)
<Shaico> lol*
<peabnuts123> lol xD
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> MTM2 Mick Thompson Signature!
<Evolution212> That looks similar to mine.
<Shaico> shiiiit that's sexy
<Shaico> dat head
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> i got it about 400 of on ebay!
<peabnuts123> I play Bass, too
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> 400 off
<peabnuts123> But my bass is... not mine ... ?
<peabnuts123> It's technically my friend's
<peabnuts123> lawl
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> I also play bass
<Shaico> me too
<Shaico> but not really professionally.
<Shaico> learning guitar means knowing somewhat how to play the bass. the fretting hand at least
<peabnuts123> Totally
<Evolution212> Does anyone have a seven-string guitar?
<peabnuts123> Pssh
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> i love my dad BC Rich Warlock http://www.guitarandampshop.co.uk/acatalog/BCRICHWARLOCKlarge.jpg
<peabnuts123> no, lol
<Shaico> nah
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> dads
<peabnuts123> but I played one in the shope
<Shaico> BC Rich guitars are good
<Shaico> but mostly for show
<peabnuts123> Egh those are nice but... I don't like metally shapes
<Evolution212> A seventh string makes your guitar 20% cooler.
<peabnuts123> Not even
<peabnuts123> It's totally 16.6 percent cooler
<peabnuts123> lackluster
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Yeah its overly metal!
<peabnuts123> I don't like them lol
<Pearly> I did not know this;
<Pearly> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_tie
<peabnuts123> even though I love metal
<peabnuts123> did not know what
<Shaico> http://profile.ultimate-guitar.com/profile_mojo_data/6/1/0/1/610178/pics/_c728831_image_0.jpg
<Shaico> my guitar
<Pearly> But they color code bread bags with the appropriate date the bread was baked
<peabnuts123> Oh
<Pearly> for example, if the bread was baked on monday, they'd use a blue twist tie
<Shaico> imagine that guitar light blue instead
<Shaico> with RD's cutie mark on
<Shaico> hell yes
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> this guitar is awesomez > http://www.espguitars.com/guitars/signature/esp-truckster.html
<peabnuts123> I know that; but in NZ they don't use twist-ties on bread...
<Shaico> ESP guitars are nice
<Pearly> Ah yeah, it's only in the usa that they do it. are you from nz peab?
<peabnuts123> Esp make SEXY AS FUCK Basses
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> Yeah i love them
<peabnuts123> yea
<peabnuts123> we have
<peabnuts123> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_clip
<Shaico> bread clip wat?
<Pearly> oh they use those here sometimes as well
<peabnuts123> They are great projectiles
<gingerale> I love autotranscribe <3 http://i.imgur.com/7qpkk.png
<Pearly> anyways, dis guitar
<Pearly> http://i1.lelong.com.my/UserImages/Items/0908/22/trader1@11.jpg
<peabnuts123> lol
<Shaico> augh my eyes
<Shaico> so bright
<peabnuts123> Did you guys see that guy singing a couple Pony songs
<peabnuts123> without music?
<Shaico> yep.
<Shaico> nice voice
<Evolution212> http://www.music-town.de/images/product_images/popup_images/40391_0.jpg
<Pearly> It hinkit'soneof steve vai's songs
<Pearly> guitars*
<peabnuts123> I transcribed that and it was saying WEIRD stuff about seals.
<Shaico> s-seals?
<peabnuts123> yea.
<peabnuts123> Totally made sense as well
<peabnuts123> It was like
<peabnuts123> creepy
<gingerale> Does Equestria have a flag? Is there anything from the show or fanon?
<peabnuts123> Yea
<peabnuts123> They just had a flag competition like 2 days ago
<gingerale> Link please <3
<peabnuts123> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/06/equestria-flags-event-post.html
<gingerale> Thanke ^^
<peabnuts123> ten seconds flat.
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> i should learn some pony songs...
<gingerale> Hmmmm
<gingerale> None of them is really a simple flag
<Muffin_Overlord_Derpy> My Little Pony METAL!
<peabnuts123> Lol
<peabnuts123> I was figuring out Winter Wrap up
<peabnuts123> I swear
<Shaico> number 2 is the best imo
<peabnuts123> that is like
<peabnuts123> 50 guitars
<Evolution212> I'll love anyone who makes guitar tabs or whatever for MLP songs.
<Shaico> lol hard as hell right?
<gingerale> It's too complex
<Shaico> i make tabs :D
<peabnuts123> I managed to transcribe the beginning up until "Winter wrap up..." and was like WE'RE DONE HERE
<peabnuts123> There is a WHOLE WEBSITE for guitar tabs and sheet music
<Shaico> Everypony Sings
<Shaico> yep I submitted tabs for CMC theme song over there
<gingerale> I'll just have to design my own flag for Equestria when the time comes
<peabnuts123> That's the one
<peabnuts123> http://www.everyponysings.com/
<Evolution212> Oh ...
<peabnuts123> I've seen more too
<Evolution212> Boy do I feel silly.
<peabnuts123> lolcats :p
<Evolution212> Thank you.
<Shaico> make sure to comment on my tabs >:O
<peabnuts123> I figured out the lead guitar bits to CMC when they were doing that sing-along on Ponychan
<peabnuts123> But the project got weird, and I didn't submit
<Shaico> yeah it's actually pretty hard
<Shaico> the opening solo at least
<peabnuts123> Eb, man?
<Shaico> Yeah.
<Shaico> you mean the tuning?
<peabnuts123> Why?
<Shaico> Eb is the tuning for CMC theme song.
<Shaico> i mean, half step down
<peabnuts123> how do you figure that
<Shaico> well i tried Bm chord for the song while tuned half step down
<Shaico> worked perfectly
<Shaico> so yeah
<Pearly> speakingof music, i should play the piano.
<peabnuts123> Hmm
<Shaico> you should. if my parents didn't force me to play piano, i wouldn't give two shits about music
<Shaico> i played for so many years and quit
<peabnuts123> I can't play piano
<Shaico> now i forgot holy crap
<peabnuts123> But I doodle on keyboard
<peabnuts123> Oh I used to play keyboard when I was much younger but forgot ALL of it
<peabnuts123> I can play a few things on keyboard
<peabnuts123> mostly pokemon music
<Shaico> i only remember the mortal kombat theme song on piano now
<peabnuts123> hahaha
<Shaico> and to think i could've played Fur Elise before
<peabnuts123> That's enough.
<Pearly> wow
<Shaico> like i said, i played for a long time
<Pearly> That must've beenweird having to be forced to play an instrument
<Shaico> well if you're asian, then no not really that weird
<peabnuts123> Lol xD
<Shaico> Asian parents HAVE to teach their kids musical instruments
<Shaico> i honestly don't know why
<Pearly> hmm
<Pearly> I learned all the instruments i know by myself
<peabnuts123> Same here
<Pearly> Well
<Shaico> yeah me too, except piano
<Shaico> drums, guitar, all that crap
<peabnuts123> But I played a lot of instruments when I was earlier
<Shaico> by myelf
<peabnuts123> Probably because generic rock instruments are easy to play lol
<Pearly> I except trumpet and french horn. but i voluntarily joined band class in 6th grade.
<Shaico> lmfao yep
<Pearly> the point is, i can play so many instruments and i enjoy them all
<Shaico> I actually learned how to play drums because of Rock Band.
<Shaico> True story
<Evolution212> Cool.
<peabnuts123> Same here, man
<peabnuts123> Rock Band was awesome.
<Pearly> I won a drum competition last year :B
<Shaico> hell yeah
<Shaico> i got 2nd D:
<peabnuts123> I bought my electric drum kit only a few weeks back
<Shaico> but then again, the guy was 10 years older than me
<Pearly> d'aw lol
<Pearly> oh nice whath kinda peab!
<Evolution212> Would anyone believe me if I said Rock Band taught me how to play guitar?
<Pearly> that makes sense shaico
<peabnuts123> It's an awesome electric drum ki
<peabnuts123> t
<peabnuts123> SUPER fake lol
<peabnuts123> XM Drums
<Shaico> he was 25, i was 15
<Shaico> lolo
<Pearly> I did a drum competition when i was 12 and got 2nd lol.
<peabnuts123> It's taiwanese or something
<Pearly> iz good
<peabnuts123> I figured it would be good for learning on
<peabnuts123> and quiet
<Shaico> wow 12 and 2nd place in a competition is quite impressive
<Pearly> likewise for 15 lol.
<peabnuts123> I'd like to get an acoustic kit some day but a.) only getting there really and b.) quite impractical
<Pearly> It was guitar center's drumoff at any rate
<Shaico> for me, it was my school's drum off
<Shaico> oh wait
<Shaico> sorry it was just a drum competition
<Pearly> oh okay
<Shaico> i'm mixing it with my school's talent show, for which I got second place also
<Pearly> I was about to wonder what a 25 year old was doing participating in a school drum competition lol.
<Pearly> oh nice :B
<Shaico> damn that ventriloquist.
<peabnuts123> lolol
<Pearly> whoah
<Pearly> oh. I thought I said lolol for some reason
<Pearly> maybe i just said it in my head.
<Shaico> freaky.
<peabnuts123> I just play music in my room, lawl
<Shaico> oh yeah, btw check out my CMC theme song cover
<Shaico> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7grA1jnsLKQ
<peabnuts123> I don't have any friends close enough at a similar skill level
<Pearly> i do it in my music room
<peabnuts123> So I can't really jam
<Pearly> awh i know that feel pea!
<Shaico> i have lots of friends who know instruments
<Shaico> in fact i had a band once
<Shaico> And we were all bronies, which made it 20% cooler
<Pearly> oh that's brilliant
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone
<Pearly> I had a band with my friends in 9th grade with originals and such. we were a metal band lol.
<peabnuts123> I play the intro an octave higher than you
<Pearly> but that died after a few years, now i'm in a cover band with my dad
<Shaico> lol wow
<Shaico> Nice. I wish MY dad even cared about music lolo
<Pearly> aw :(
<Pearly> that's how my mom is.

<Shaico> she loves music. just different tastes than mine
<Shaico> Classical music lover
<peabnuts123> I've been jotting around with a piece for Octavia recently
<peabnuts123> Been trying my best to write an almost classical piece on the guitar
<Pearly> with a classical guitar?
<peabnuts123> I don't have a classical ;_;
<peabnuts123> But my acoustic sounds good anyway
<Pearly> d'aw lol
<Pearly> ah okay good
<Shaico> lol
<Shaico> wait your acoustic semi string, or nylon?
<peabnuts123> I'm not sure a classical would sound that good with the idea anwyway
<peabnuts123> Both my acoustics are steel string :p
<Shaico> oh lol
<Shaico> i learned the guitar using nylon
<Shaico> then went on to semi
<Shaico> then electric
<peabnuts123> Learnt on my electric and then learnt acoustic on my crappy acoustic lol
<peabnuts123> The action is SO HIGH
<peabnuts123> but it was good to learn on though
<peabnuts123> Makes you a MAN
<Pearly> I recorded this super long crazy piao improv and called it 'this song is pinkie pie'
<peabnuts123> lol
<peabnuts123> awesome xD
<Shaico> my first nylon's action was higher than a hippie watching Grateful Dead
<peabnuts123> but nylon bends really easy
<peabnuts123> It's so nice
<peabnuts123> I had my friend's classical for a while, once
<peabnuts123> It was REALLY CRAP
<peabnuts123> But it sounded _amazing_
<Shaico> yeah nylons are great for that acoustic guitar solo.
<peabnuts123> e_e
<Shaico> the only song that I can name that has an acoustic guitar solo is....
<Shaico> uh
<Shaico> What I've Got - Sublime
<peabnuts123> Dream Theater
<peabnuts123> Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence
<peabnuts123> Part.. 7 or something
<Shaico> Dream Theater does that also?
<Shaico> nice
<Pearly> ah man
<Pearly> I used to be obsessed with 6doit so much
<Pearly> solitary shell is the one you're talking bout <.<
<Evolution212> You're talking about Solitary Shell.
<peabnuts123> Yea man
<Pearly> i know the keyboard parts to it lol
<Evolution212> It uses a 12-string.
<peabnuts123> It's like
<peabnuts123> The best sounding guitar
<Shaico> i don't really listen to Dream Theatre much
<peabnuts123> EVER
<Shaico> not into prog metal
<peabnuts123> How much keyboard parts can you play, Pearly?
<Pearly> yeah it's pretty, i love the build up in that song into the end
<Pearly> of that song?
<peabnuts123> Of... like the "whole" song
<Pearly> pretty much everything of it with a half assed piano solo
<peabnuts123> fufufu can you play About To Crash
<peabnuts123> The intro bit
<peabnuts123> I <3 that
<Pearly> Hmm
<Pearly> I tried to learn it a few years ago, I have the sheet music to it lol
<Evolution212> The intro to the reprise of About to Crash is bloody difficult.
<Shaico> funny how most of the music i listen to have easy ass guitar in it
<peabnuts123> I can play the guitar intro? Lol
<Shaico> like, drop D and going up and down the neck
<peabnuts123> Lol
<peabnuts123> Dropped tuning
<Shaico> yep
<Shaico> but it's still damn good
<peabnuts123> It sounds so metal
<peabnuts123> It's awesome lol
<Shaico> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17mD4reFUlw
<peabnuts123> It's a minor life goal of mine to cover Six Degrees/Octavarium one man band
<Shaico> drop D song
<Shaico> but so so so awesome
<Pearly> oh man yeah i just kinda went through the about to crash intro
<Evolution212> I want to hear it when you're done, peabnuts.
<peabnuts123> Thanks
<peabnuts123> It's a few years off
<peabnuts123> lol
<Evolution212> I'm not surprised.
<Pearly> speaking of octavarium, i just learned parts of the solo in like part 4 of it
<peabnuts123> I think one of the least metal Dropped D songs I know is Everlong
<Shaico> Everlong - Foo Fighters?
<peabnuts123> Yea
<Shaico> that's drop D? lol
<Shaico> the more you know
<Evolution212> I'm a sucky guitarist, but I always want to try playing Dream Theater.
<Evolution212> It's a curse.
<peabnuts123> Eh
<Pearly> that's how i was evolution
<peabnuts123> It's a learning process
<peabnuts123> I've been learning Rush's YYZ on Bass for like
<peabnuts123> 3 years now
<peabnuts123> and I've only been played 3 years, lol
<Pearly> tbh i just picked up the guitar and start practicing dt crap the best i could. i'll get it eventually lmao
<Shaico> yeah i'm not even that good at guitar yet
<peabnuts123> It's legit
<Evolution212> DT is the reason I got a seven-string.
<peabnuts123> You eventually get better at it
<peabnuts123> Yea
<Shaico> the hardest i can play right now is Bohemian Rhapsody solo
<Evolution212> I wanted to play the intro to A Change of Seasons.
<peabnuts123> I am irked that I can't play HEAPS of their stuff
<peabnuts123> Glass Prison e_e
<Evolution212> lolglassprison
<peabnuts123> Glass Prison is a good song
<Evolution212> I know.
<Pearly> ee
<Evolution212> It's one of my favourites.
<Evolution212> Just the difficulty ...
<peabnuts123> Lol
<Pearly> i played glass prison on the drums the other day. it's so fun
<peabnuts123> Everything is that hard, man
<Evolution212> Yep.
<peabnuts123> I want to learn riffs from songs like the beginning of Great Debate
<peabnuts123> But it's like NOPE seven string.
<peabnuts123> and even If I get a seven string; I want a decent amp to play it with
<Evolution212> I'm going to learn them to spite you.
<peabnuts123> And that's like
<peabnuts123> So many moneys.
<Pearly> learn dance of eternity!
<Shaico> i can't keep up with this dream theatre talk D:
<peabnuts123> lolcats
<Evolution212> oh gawd
<Sneas> lolwtf
<Evolution212> I think I have a decent enough grasp of changing time signatures but please not Dance of Eternity.
<peabnuts123> I am ashamed I have not made it to that album yet
<Pearly> Aw
<peabnuts123> Like I said before
<peabnuts123> DT has like
<peabnuts123> 9001 hours of muisc
<peabnuts123> music
<Evolution212> Scenes From a Memory is one of their best.
<Pearly> It's one of their best imo. I learned dance of eternity on the drums a few years ago..it took FOREVER and ever
<Shaico> OH i know Dance of Eternity
<Shaico> that's the only song I know from DT
<Evolution212> It's my favourite album actually.
<Pearly> i like beyond this life
<peabnuts123> fine
<peabnuts123> *puts it on*
<Evolution212> My favourite song from it is probably Home.
<peabnuts123> Typical Dream Theater
<peabnuts123> none of this "okay; this is pretty cool.."
<peabnuts123> It's instantly bad ass
<Evolution212> :D
<Pearly> i actually had that feel with octavarium..it was my first album from them i got
<peabnuts123> Who needs multiple listenings of songs when they can impress you the first time
<Pearly> and it was an okay this is pretty cool. whoah why did they not play 4\4 there.
<peabnuts123> Octavarium was the first DT song I EVER HEARD
<peabnuts123> And I listened to it like
<Pearly> oh snap
<Pearly> Lol
<peabnuts123> heaps
<Pearly> mine was the big medley
<Evolution212> I'm ashamed to say Pull Me Under was the first song I heard of theirs.
<Evolution212> On Guitar Hero ...
<peabnuts123> what time signature is going on here ;_;
<Pearly> d'aw
<Pearly> dat overture 1928
<peabnuts123> Probably my favourite song by DT
<peabnuts123> Well, fav is pretty... redundant
<peabnuts123> My currently most enjoyed is prolly something like
<Pearly> Lolol
<peabnuts123> War inside my head? or something
<peabnuts123> Actually I've had a hungering from These Walls lately
<peabnuts123> I love the synth on that
<Pearly> in the chorus?
<peabnuts123> Yea
<Pearly> ah yeah
<peabnuts123> or Great Debate
<Pearly> that was the first song where i was like
<Pearly> wtf time signatures
<Evolution212> These Walls sounds ten times deeper than it actually is.
<peabnuts123> I've stopped listening to that all the time now though
<Pearly> TEAR DOWN THIS WALL.
<peabnuts123> A new song of theirs I've found is awesoem is
<peabnuts123> uh
<peabnuts123> *looks up spelling*
<peabnuts123> Erotomania
<Evolution212> Erotomania is like erotica to my ears.
<Pearly> LOL
<peabnuts123> I guess that's the point e_e
<Pearly> Oh gosh.I got to see dream theater live and they did that song and they messed up
<peabnuts123> lolol
<Evolution212> Hah.
<peabnuts123> Can you really blame them?
<Evolution212> I really want to see them live.
<Pearly> nopey dopey lol.
<kiku> are there any lonely ladies out there
<Evolution212> Hopefully they'll be coming to Australia sometime soon.
<peabnuts123> Dream Theater is on my (extensive) list of "Awesome bands that played here before I found them"
<peabnuts123> And Auckland, New Zealand is not exactly a well-frequented place for bands
<Evolution212> I feel for you.
<peabnuts123> But I sort of; don't get excited over gigs for some reason
<peabnuts123> I mean
<peabnuts123> I enjoy them
<peabnuts123> and I imagine them being fun
<peabnuts123> But when they come around i'm always just like "meh"
<peabnuts123> like disturbed WAS on that list but they played here again recently
<peabnuts123> and I didn't go
<peabnuts123> Just because
<peabnuts123> And metallica even played
<Evolution212> I have the hair for headbanging in a mosh, but I never do it.
<peabnuts123> But I kinda just, cbf
<gingerale> Hmmm
<gingerale> God Hoof.
<Pearly> oh speaking of all this dream theater, they finally got their new drummer
<Evolution212> I knew that long ago. :p
<peabnuts123> *out of the loop* ..portnoy...?
<Pearly> I didn't ;_;
<gingerale> Dragon kick your flank into milky way!
<Pearly> LOL
<gingerale> *buck
<Pearly> new, mike mangini!
<Pearly> no*
<peabnuts123> What happened to Portnoy lol
<Pearly> he left the band.
<peabnuts123> ;_;
<Evolution212> He wanted to take a break.
<Pearly> I KNOW I WAS SO SAD
<Evolution212> No one agreed.
<peabnuts123> But I shit dicks evvery day listening to him
<peabnuts123> Well he deserves a break, man
<Pearly> yeah you're right.
<Evolution212> Should I be ashamed for wanting them to pick Marco Minnemann just because the guy was wearing a Cookie Monster shirt?
<peabnuts123> He probably can't even eat his cereal in the morning without making it into a polyrhythm
<Pearly> I'm excited for the new album with mangini though
<Pearly> lmao pea
<peabnuts123> *can't spell rythm*
<Pearly> that made me giggle
<Shaico> rhyrhm
<Shaico> crap
<Shaico> rhythm
<Shaico> hah
<Evolution212> You spelled rhythm right the first time.
<peabnuts123> It's funny because you know YOU do it.
<peabnuts123> o rly?
<peabnuts123> I am awesome.
<peabnuts123> So this Mike Mangini fellow
<peabnuts123> Who is he
<HyperMetalLugia> O.O
<Pearly> the most memorable thing i read about him was that he has played with steve vai and has held the world's fastest drummer record
<Animal_Overlord_Fluttershy> LOLZER
<Shaico> Mike Patton is better
<HyperMetalLugia> Small channel
<peabnuts123> o rly?
<peabnuts123> enteiresting
<Pearly> yeah
<Animal_Overlord_Fluttershy> Cool
<peabnuts123> Overlord_fluttershy
<peabnuts123> I love how your name is super long
<Animal_Overlord_Fluttershy> yeah!
<peabnuts123> and indentes all my tect
<peabnuts123> text
<peabnuts123> by like
<peabnuts123> 8 tabs
<Animal_Overlord_Fluttershy> erm... was i too loud...
<Animal_Overlord_Fluttershy> um...
<Pearly> But virgil donati has played with steve vai before as well. dt didn't choose him though. and if mangini got this job over donati then he must be huhmazinging
<Ascendant> ?
<Barry> Hello?
<peabnuts123> lol
<peabnuts123> Hey
<peabnuts123> Whatever happened with
<Ascendant> not as bad as both ambernova and flame being down lol
<Evolution212> Didn't Donati screw up in Dance of Eternity in the audition?
<peabnuts123> Avenged Sevenfold
<Ray> 02lol
<Evolution212> Avenged Sevenfold dumped Mike.
<Pearly> Oh idk, Ididn't watch
<peabnuts123> Dumped whom?
<peabnuts123> I meant replacing um
<peabnuts123> The Rev
<Evolution212> Something about the way he handled the publicity.
<Evolution212> Mike played in the Rev's place but the band got rid of him afterwards.
<Evolution212> He was replaced by some new guy.
<peabnuts123> Who; Portnoy?
<Evolution212> Yeah.
<Pearly> i'm sure portnoy was just filling in for their tour
<peabnuts123> Damn, that would have been awesome
<Evolution212> He said he was having fun with them.
<peabnuts123> Hehe
<Evolution212> After they dumped him he tried getting back in DT.
<Evolution212> By that time Mike Mangini had been hired already.
<Pearly> vaaht
<Pearly> where'd you hear the stuff from?
<peabnuts123> Wikipedia?
<Evolution212> Mike Portnoy himself.
<peabnuts123> I almost feel like i've read it.
<Pearly> that sounds like crazy rumours
<Evolution212> Hold on, I'll find a link.
<Pearly> okaky
<Pearly> ok*
<peabnuts123> Yea
<peabnuts123> It's on Wikipedia
<peabnuts123> I totally already read all of this
<peabnuts123> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Portnoy#Avenged_Sevenfold.2C_Departure_from_Dream_Theater_and_Future
<peabnuts123> What is Metropolis Pt.2... Part 2 /of/?
<Hipster_Brony> 8Hi
<Evolution212> I'm trying to find the actual post on his forum.
<peabnuts123> Man
<peabnuts123> I want Score to be on Vinyl
<peabnuts123> Can you imagine how amazing (and many sides) that would be
<Pearly> MORETHAN 2
<peabnuts123> lol
<peabnuts123> I bought Black Album today
<peabnuts123> That is four sides on it's own.
<peabnuts123> And Metallica's S&M is 6 sides
<lolwutman> hai guise
<peabnuts123> I'm woody
<Shaico> i do not like Metallica anymore
<peabnuts123> Howdy howdy howdy
<peabnuts123> Don't like their new stuff?
<peabnuts123> I need to get Death Magnetic on Vinyl..
<lolwutman> no, you're peanuts
<Shaico> not at all
<Woody> Howdy Howdy howdy
<Evolution212> Gah, Portnoy must have removed the post from his site.
<Shaico> Death Magnetic seems like just a compilation of Metallica's riifs
<Shaico> they don't feel like songs
<lolwutman> st angers sucks.
<Peabnuts123> St Anger is /okay/ it's really dull though
<lolwutman> just saiyin
<Peabnuts123> I love Load/Reload
<Peabnuts123> And Death Magnetic is good but
<Peabnuts123> It's different
<Peabnuts123> no doubt about it
<Peabnuts123> but I'm totally put off by Death Magnetic's CD mastering
<Peabnuts123> It sounds great on Record
<Apokalipse> hey
<lolwutman> i like death magnetic for some reason
<Shaico> i've gotten really really bored of metallica
<Shaico> i've listened to them for too long
<Peabnuts123> you certainly can
<Peabnuts123> I am just back on them
<Peabnuts123> In a casual kind of way
<Hipster_Brony> 8Hi
<Peabnuts123> Not listening to them hardcore
<lolwutman> metallica's in my top 15 favourite artist/bands

<Pearly> http://myfacewhen.com/thumbs/tn_36.jpg
<Hipster_Brony> 8sorry, i'm dealing with like 5 different tabs right now, so it might take a while to respond
<Peabnuts123> Daft Punk have like 5 good songs in my book
<Peabnuts123> you're doing it wrong, Pearly
<Hipster_Brony> 8better early than late, amirite?
<Apokalipse> no problem
<Shaico> Daft Punk is a decent House group.
<Apokalipse> you are very right
<Shaico> deadmau5 > Daft Punk
<Peabnuts123> Daft Punk have
<lolwutman> yeah i like house music
<Pearly> well i can't make a face here
<Peabnuts123> SO MANY weird songs that you have never heard of and I don't like
<Shaico> u like dubstep?
<lolwutman> yep
<Peabnuts123> ehhh
<lolwutman> i know most of them
<Shaico> Skrillex?
<Apokalipse> How many visitors does the re broadcast usually attract?
<Pearly> neal morse was decent though
<lolwutman> skillrex's okay
<Barry> How is everyone?
<Shaico> he's like the only dubstep artist i know lolo
<Apokalipse> good
<lolwutman> rly?
<Peabnuts123> I don't dig it
<Apokalipse> a bit sleepy
<Shaico> yep
<Peabnuts123> about the only thing I can say I "like" is Originality
<Apokalipse> Thanks to a certain movie night
<Peabnuts123> Dubstep goes against this
<lolwutman> then im with you
<Peabnuts123> However I will jam to it's Transformers samples
<Hipster_Brony> 8well, this is our 1st week doing the encore presentation, so we dont really know
<Peabnuts123> But it's all the same to me
<Apokalipse> oh, really?
<Shaico> if u like originality, check out Mr. Bungle
<lolwutman> except for the part about dubstep
<Hipster_Brony> 8could be a ton, could be only a few
<Shaico> holy crap they're awesome
<Apokalipse> Ah I didn't know
<lolwutman> agreed
<lolwutman> or, "eyup"
<Barry> We're doing what movies? Yesterday's?
<Shaico> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnLNXquIBVs
<Peabnuts123> prolly my favourite band
<Apokalipse> yup
<Peabnuts123> and by favourite band i really mean most respected
<Peabnuts123> because I love so much music
<Peabnuts123> Is Primus
<Barry> cool. I get to catch Best Night Ever, and also Aladdin from the beginning
<Peabnuts123> <3 Primus
<lolwutman> actually tbh, i dont respect any band
<Shaico> Primus is meh
<Peabnuts123> It's easy to hate primus
<Shaico> i don't see what the big deal is about Les
<Peabnuts123> They play such weird music.
<Barry> I missed those two because I went to Dairy Queen last night at around 7 PM
<lolwutman> because they WILL have some shitty songs at somepoint of time
<Peabnuts123> But Les' Bass lines make me jizz
<Apokalipse> I missed the B movie. Can't remember what it was lol
<Shaico> Mr. Bungle is much much weirder trust me
<Peabnuts123> He's just... really good at bass
<Barry> Star- something
<Peabnuts123> So far it's about even with Primus
<Peabnuts123> Primus is not about being weird
<Peabnuts123> Primus ARE weird
<Peabnuts123> But I just love Les' work
<Peabnuts123> I just love it
<Peabnuts123> in my pants
<lolwutman> notacleverpony is number 9 on my list of top musicbros
<Shaico> Cheese.
<Shaico> number 1 for me is Eurobeat Brony
<Shaico> Seriously. He's talented
<lolwutman> true
<Barry> Will this kind of thing happen throughout the Summer, or all year?
<Shaico> 2 is Saltakrits
<lolwutman> eurobrony is number 10 for me
<Shaico> or however you spell his name
<Shaico> who's your number one?
<lolwutman> daft punk
<Shaico> i mean brony musicicians
<lolwutman> oh
<Hipster_Brony> 8Starship Troopers is the movie
<Shaico> well hey hey hey about time Dashie is on
<lolwutman> in tat case, it would be notacleverpony
<Hipster_Brony> 8and the plan is to continue BMN for as long as we possibly can
<Shaico> awesome
<Barry> ah
<Barry> Good to hear
<Dashie|semi-AFK> Haha
<Hipster_Brony> 8once the fall rolls around and we get new MLP episodes, we will be live streaming them as well
<Peabnuts123> oh my god
<Peabnuts123> I want to show you a Primus song
<Peabnuts123> But I cannot remember the name of it.
<lolwutman> all his songs have the "i can play this FOREVER and not get tired of it" factor
<Barry> There's not to many events that let us Bronies interact together
<Apokalipse> oh nice
<Shaico> Tommy the Cat?
<Shaico> That racecar driver song?
<Peabnuts123> Nope
<Peabnuts123> Those are both good songs
<Peabnuts123> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flxy6ILzcx4
<Peabnuts123> Just listen
<Peabnuts123> to his bass tone
<Peabnuts123> lol
<Barry> And so we don't have any gender confusion, I'm a 22 year old male
<lolwutman> me gusta
<Barry> Gonna be 23 this October
<Peabnuts123> and now I am listening to Primus
<lolwutman> except the weird-ass cover art
<Shaico> "primus sucks"
<Shaico> isn't that their motto or something?
<Barry> Though I can't wait for tomorrow
<Peabnuts123> It's a bit of a catch phrase
<Peabnuts123> lol
<Peabnuts123> Coz; Brutal.
<Peabnuts123> get to it
<Apokalipse> How come?
<Coz|Do_11_Assignments_in_3_Day> gonna need alot of red bull
<Peabnuts123> okay how about
<Peabnuts123> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5cOqCjInYI
<lolwutman> diplo's pretty boss too
<Peabnuts123> hows that for a bass line
<Peabnuts123> e_e
<Barry> Ocarina of Time 3D will be released in America then
<Apokalipse> oh
<Shaico> oh holy crap
<Shaico> when he played higher on the bass
<Shaico> that lil fil
<Shaico> fill*
<Shaico> wow
<Barry> Ocarina of time was my favorite Legend of Zelda game, so I hope the 3D version is just as good
<lolwutman> why primus isnt eligible for a VEVO, i will never know
<Apokalipse> Hopefully
<Peabnuts123> Prolly 'cause
<Peabnuts123> Oh wait they are together gain...
<Peabnuts123> New album coming out *SO EXCITED*
<Apokalipse> I'll be afk for a couple of minutes
<Apokalipse> So yeah...
<lolwutman> because some VEVO artists really suck
<Peabnuts123> Really though, the songs you mentioned before; Tommy The Cat and Jerry Was A Racecar Driver are shining examples of Primus
<Shaico> for some reason Primus reminds me so much of Butthole Surfers
<Peabnuts123> Totally, man
<Peabnuts123> But
<Peabnuts123> Maybe with a bit more talent, lol
<lolwutman> like the cataracs who always have that DEV kid feature in their songs
<Dashie|semi-AFK> Primus is the guys in those costumes, yes?
<Shaico> lol definietely.
<lolwutman> i dunnno lol
<Peabnuts123> Dashie
<Peabnuts123> you are referring to this
<Peabnuts123> aren't you
<Peabnuts123> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYDfwUJzYQg
<Peabnuts123> Oh hey

<Peabnuts123> The Pen tool makes no sense at first
<Pearly> No peab! I used to play it all the time, just not lately due to the community and
<Shaico> http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/552010
<Shaico> this
<Maeni> How did you learn that? I have a lot of problems with it, I guess I just need to learn how to do certain things
<Peabnuts123> Until you sit down and fiddle with it like "okay, how the fuck does this work."
<Pearly> the company in general..in fact i just cancelled my membership today
<drf|away> 03*WB02(eXAKR02)03WB* - <eXAKR> It's eXAKR! Everyone hide before he attacks you with Falcon-Punching bendy buses!

<Maeni> for example you can choose between having it fill automatically, but that blocks your view (hnnngh) but if you choose the other one, you have to fill it later which wont be vector then D:
<Shaico> and play
<Peabnuts123> We should play club penguin/habbo hotel/second life
<Cupcake_Overlord_Pinkie> http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/ <look at my vectors!!!
*eXAKR blames Wheatley and Nightmare Moon
<Evolution212> Pony MMO. Saliva-worthy.

<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> The Princess has Arrived!
<Pearly> Hi celestia
<Maeni> Out of nowhere, Princess Celest

<Peabnuts123> I mean
<Peabnuts123> I could make a really simple Pony game lol
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Don't worry im not evil or anything.....
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> hehe
<Maeni> Do eeet!
<Peabnuts123> It'd be a good learn for netcode
<Shaico> Come on I'll make the room in Booty Wars
<Peabnuts123> I've never dabbled
<Shaico> durrr :(
<Peabnuts123> I closed it because it had a tutorial
<Peabnuts123> e_e
<Shaico> well just skip it
<Maeni> There's a lot I want to do, but I dont because of laziness and because I'm not already good at them. Durrrr
<Shaico> it's pretty simple
<Peabnuts123> It took too long
<Evolution212> Booty Wars doesn't sound too fun anyway.
<Peabnuts123> Lolol
<Shaico> Try it any evo
<Peabnuts123> It kinda doesn't.
<Shaico> It has nothing to do with Booty
<Shaico> at all
<Maeni> Play it for the plot
<Peabnuts123> Then i'm not interested
<Peabnuts123> lololol
<eXAKR> My brain was on derp mpode all day

<Hipster_Brony> 8woke up, got on Brony State, have been doing BMN stuff ever since
<Maeni> Ah, I see.. Sounds better to me, but it just must take so long? D:
<Peabnuts123> Stroke is
<Peabnuts123> Disappointing
<Maeni> eeyup.
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Its take about half an hour when i do it...
<Maeni> It doesn't let you have sharp points
<Peabnuts123> And everything is the same width
<Maeni> Unless you use similate pen pressure
<Maeni> simulate*
<Peabnuts123> Yea but...
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> yeah to match the still of width of the show
<Peabnuts123> How do with Stroke... e_e
<Maeni> Huh.
<HyperMetalLugia> So now eXAKR shows is true form

<Peabnuts123> I'm not talented enough to draw properly =D
<Dashie|AFK> Hmm
<Silverscreen> First thread will be up today @ 5PM EST
<midnightshadow> http://i.imgur.com/jJMLJ.png
<Pearly> Me neither
<midnightshadow> thats the best i can do
<Pearly> oh man
<Peabnuts123> I can draw ponies - in a standing upright position
<Pearly> I have a pic of rbd i drew hold on lol
<Maeni> I wish I knew more about coloring..
<Peabnuts123> And I can draw them pretty well; but THAT'S IT
<Shaico> i suck at drawing
<Shaico> really suck
<Peabnuts123> I think I would like to try a tablet
<Evolution212> Who has tried to draw themselves as a pony?
<Dashie> And then, one last nickchange.
<Peabnuts123> I feel my drawing skills would improve vastly
<SilverSonic> !todo list
<Dashie|AFK> Yesssss.
<Shaico> the thing that bothers me is the head shape
<Shaico> i can't draw head shapes at ALL
<Pearly> http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/8977/rbdyo.png
<Peabnuts123> Their head shape is a circle...
<eXAKR> What
<Dashie|AFK> I just used the pony generator, Evo
<Pearly> there's my rbd, i forgot to put wings on her
<Peabnuts123> aww ^_^
<Maeni> http://ponibooru.413chan.net/_images/a1304a753ddbbf49a3a1fa91cc5a9afb/15727%20-%20Fallout%20fallout_equestria%20Littlepip%20original_character%20Velvet_Remedy.jpg I spent gosh knows how long on this too, I just feel I have huge trouble selecting the right colors
<midnightshadow> http://i.imgur.com/jJMLJ.png is the best i can do, but that's derpy
<Evolution212> I found out about the pony generator afterwards.
<Shaico> i can't draw circles
<Peabnuts123> Maeni
<Peabnuts123> That's awesome
<Maeni> Not to mention how i messed up Lilpip
<Evolution212> I still try to draw ponies though.
<Maeni> thanks :3
<Peabnuts123> I spent time looking at a still picture of them
<Peabnuts123> and copying it down
<Peabnuts123> and just memorising all their details
<Shaico> i want to learn how to draw pony
<Evolution212> Hm ...
<Shaico> so i can draw porny
<midnightshadow> and nopony thinks my derpy is any good\
<midnightshadow> :(
<midnightshadow> not even a comment
<midnightshadow> not a sausage
<Peabnuts123> I totally commented on it
<Evolution212> Is Fallout Equestria a really good story?
<Maeni> I- i ..!
<Peabnuts123> Oh
<Peabnuts123> I forgot to relate my comment
<midnightshadow> Peabnuts123: you..commented on my pic? whatd you think?
<Peabnuts123> I said I could draw them standing
<Peabnuts123> But forgot to say
<Maeni> It's just the shapes in the body that are off~
<Peabnuts123> Your posing was > mine
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> yeah i dont like strokes... just tried it
<midnightshadow> Peabnuts123: yours didnt load for me :(
<Peabnuts123> my animation was just a trace from the show :p
<midnightshadow> Evolution212: fallout equestria's got 6 stars, but ymmv. i dont know though, im a pre-reader but I didnt read it
<Peabnuts123> It didn't require any artistic skill
<Peabnuts123> and
<Peabnuts123> midnightshadow
<Pearly> i'll brb, going out to eat with the rents
<Maeni> It is a really good story
<Maeni> like, really.
<Peabnuts123> While not very Pony, I think the style on derpy's head is cool
<Peabnuts123> It's old timey
<Peabnuts123> like old Disney
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> this one was a free hand trace on adobe flash of a drawing i did http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d3fkuh4
<Evolution212> Alright, thanks. I was a bit apprehensive because it was a crossover.
<Evolution212> I'll go read it.
<midnightshadow> Peabnuts123: its...not very pony? :(
<Maeni> Yah, the muzzle looks more realistic than in MLP actually, in MLP they're very flash-animation-styled
<midnightshadow> Peabnuts123: hmm, muzzles ARE difficult though.
<Peabnuts123> It's not very Lauren Faust pony
<Peabnuts123> but so waht?
<midnightshadow> yeah, its kind of halfway between male and female, isnt it?
<Maeni> midnight, I'd say if you resize the wing, make her chest less large and fix the muzzle (if you want her to look more MLP-like and not horse-like), then it's mighty fine :3
<Maeni> And of course, work on coloring, those damn colors *angerfist*
<midnightshadow> http://i.imgur.com/kphvm.png is what id id yesterday
<midnightshadow> ugh, yeah, i SUCK at colouring
<Peabnuts123> lolcats
<Peabnuts123> What a twist
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> thats much better!
<Maeni> Wth that is indeed
<Maeni> Hahaha, Eee-nope.
<midnightshadow> yesterdays pic is better?
<Maeni> Eeyup.
<Peabnuts123> ultimately
<midnightshadow> maybe my colouring ruined it
<Peabnuts123> It's super gay but
<Peabnuts123> drawing is just for fun
<midnightshadow> oi!
<Maeni> Hahaha
<Shaico> your pic needed some more shading midnight
<Peabnuts123> (not your drawing)
<Peabnuts123> drawing is just for fun and you should just draw no matter what your drawings come out like
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> im still trying to master drawing them on paper http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d3hqdku (if any one can guess who on her back gets 50 points)
<midnightshadow> yeah, caramels not allowed to help build bigmacs house of cards
<Peabnuts123> FINN
<Peabnuts123> The human
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> !!!
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> AWESOME!
<midnightshadow> thats...pretty good!
<Peabnuts123> =D
<Maeni> Twilight looks like she's deathly tired
<Maeni> :|
<Peabnuts123> She's not impressed
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> i no
<Maeni> like really exhausted
<midnightshadow> twi looks like twi, and yeah shes exhausted
<midnightshadow> look at them bags
<Maeni> XD
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> then i vectored twilight http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d3hswc5
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> i fudged up the eyes
<midnightshadow> goddamn how do you get lines that DONT SUCK ASS
<Peabnuts123> PEN TOOL
<Peabnuts123> Everywhere
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> practices
<midnightshadow> fuck me but i just cant get lines like that
<Peabnuts123> srsly pen tool everwhere.
<Peabnuts123> All over your face
<midnightshadow> i have gimp
<Peabnuts123> (and twilight's)
<Maeni> Pen tool is a god damn prick, but he has skills
<midnightshadow> all over your face, in your hair, on your back
<Maeni> Befriend pen tool, and you will have those skills
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> LOL my first attempt with pen tool http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d3gn9al
<Peabnuts123> You just have to befriend pen tool
<midnightshadow> does it smooth out jitters of the strokes?
<Peabnuts123> You don't draw with it
<Peabnuts123> You click point
<Peabnuts123> vertices
<midnightshadow> :O
<Peabnuts123> and it interpolates between them
<Maeni> That's your FIRST ATTEMPT, Celest? ...
<midnightshadow> ohhhhhhhh
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> yep
<midnightshadow> well fuck me again
<Maeni> go away ;_;
<midnightshadow> i'll see if I can get the handle on that
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> ...
<midnightshadow> you're too good :(
<Peabnuts123> It's REALLY WEIRD
<Shaico> Holy crap Celestia
<Peabnuts123> But you get used to it
<Shaico> DAYUM you're good
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> i just get the hang of stuff easily
<Peabnuts123> and you learn how it fits together
<Shaico> That looks exactly like the show
<midnightshadow> http://i.imgur.com/dsalw.png first pony
<Shaico> perfect
<midnightshadow> have i got better?
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Erm... YEP!
<Peabnuts123> Your first pony is way better than mine, lawl
<Peabnuts123> Lol
<Shaico> midnight, you need to add some color to the eyes
<Peabnuts123> Celestia
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> 20% better
<Shaico> otherwise, really really good
<Peabnuts123> I'm admiring Scoot when I notice her eyes
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> i no
<midnightshadow> Shaico: tell me about it. i suck at colour
<Maeni> That is good indeed. Have you tried following those guidelines that are around?
<midnightshadow> http://i.imgur.com/aSlgK.png i want to see THIS pose done properly
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> I could fix it but... i cant be bothered
<Evolution212> I'm reading the intro to Fallout: Equestria. It sounds epic but I know if I read it before watching MLP it would sound cheesy.
<Maeni> Wow, wat
<midnightshadow> sword pony?
<Maeni> >before watching MLP
<Maeni> wat?
<Peabnuts123> Yea, it's good enough
<Evolution212> It was a dark period of my life, Maeni.
<midnightshadow> that pony-with-sword sketch was done in about ten seconds flat, so..hehe
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> this is my favourite i did http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d3hpp7a
<Maeni> D;
<midnightshadow> awww, fillyshy
<Peabnuts123> aww
<midnightshadow> you're just crushing my hopes and dreams now
<Peabnuts123> You nailed her tail
<Shaico> dawwwww
<midnightshadow> because i am SO not that good\
<Maeni> Sooo..
<Pearly> Well we haven't left yet
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> sorry midnight shadow... you can get betters
<Peabnuts123> Just draw for the fun of it
<Pearly> But i'm picking up a job application at some pizza place
<Maeni> the yellow line that forms her plot, when it hits her hair, I can spot some eraser tool ;]
<Maeni> Anyways~
<Maeni> Evo, what was that supposed to mean? D:
<Shaico> what's a plot?
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Here is my first attempt at drawing ponies on paper every and that sucked http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/30029013#/d3eb4c1
<Revolver> Huzzah, all.
<Evolution212> You mean 'before watching MLP'.
<Maeni> Aye
<Revolver> Better than mine.
<Peabnuts123> Plot
<Maeni> And the part about a dark part of your lfie
<Revolver> But I got better.
<Pearly> lol celestia. the squigglies under her make her look like
<Pearly> a rocking horse
<Peabnuts123> plot = I watch it for the "plot"
<Evolution212> That meant the time before I watched My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and became a brony.
<Shaico> oh that plot
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> does that make anyone feel better...?
<Revolver> http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Pony11001.jpg
<Peabnuts123> That's like my first pony except
<Maeni> Oh :(
<Peabnuts123> I only did the guide circles because of the drawing guides
<Revolver> Hai lucas.
<Pearly> my first pony was that rbdyo.png lol.
<Revolver> *Lucas
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> yeah i do the circles
<Peabnuts123> I read up lots of them before even trying
<Peabnuts123> They helped a lot
<Maeni> Well FOE isn't cheesy xD Except maybe at the very start, when you're like "durrr, MLP + fallout, no way"
<midnightshadow> Evil_Overlord_Celestia: actually yeah, thats making me feel better
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/30029013#/d3em6g5
<Revolver> I don't do the guide circles, lol.
<Evolution212> I love Fallout as well, so I think it's easy to adjust.
<Evolution212> And the intro was perfect.
<Maeni> :D
<Evolution212> I read it in Ron Perlman's voice.
<Revolver> Damn you, vectors.
<Pearly> wow not bad celestia
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Vectors!
<Maeni> Vectooooooors!!!
<Revolver> I havve to pay my cousin for vectors.
<Evolution212> VECTOR SIGMA!
<Balloons> I drew a Luna for today's training ground. it's terrible xP
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> but yeah my newer stuff is 20% better!
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> i do vectors for free i took a few requests recently
<Revolver> Primarily because I don't own anything beyond MS Paint.
<Maeni> http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/4290/abandonedponies.jpg these two were some of my first few ponies I drew
<Revolver> This makes me sad.
<Pearly> All vectoring is is just cropping out a pony right? but to like, the finest degree
<Maeni> Aka before I saw all those shape guides
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> i drew this for i think the 3rd training grounds http://blowingbomb.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d3gslvx
<Flamester> So, hello people.
<Maeni> Cute :3
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Bonjour!
<Revolver> Hello.
<Peabnuts123> Vectoring is drawing with vector-based shapes
<Pearly> wow that one is really nice evil overlord
<Maeni> Hekki Flamester
<Lucas> Rev
<Pearly> hey flame
<Lucas> hay?
<Pearly> What's a vector based shape?
<Evolution212> That's adorable.
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> try wikipedia if you want to no http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics
<Maeni> A shape that isn't made out of pixels, so you can keep making it larger and it will always be just as detailed
<Donitz> nice. What program do you use?
<Pearly> oh wow
<Pearly> that's neat
<Maeni> Vectors are made out of pure
<Maeni> liquid
<Maeni> MATHEMATICS
<Flamester> Looks like Illustrator.
<Donitz> Ah
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> I have been using photoshop... not exactly a vector
<Pearly> interesting
<midnightshadow> okay, tell a lie. THIS is my first pony.
<midnightshadow> http://i.imgur.com/c9SVP.jpg
<Pearly> Lol maeni you made me giggle
<Maeni> :D
<Pearly> Vectors are made out of pure liquid mathematics
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> oh....
<Maeni> Mission accomplished
<Flamester> oh, nice.
<Pearly> you almost made me bust out laughing near my dad and i had to change it to a cough
<Peabnuts123> midnight
<Peabnuts123> I still like your faces
<Peabnuts123> They are cool
<Flamester> But really, you should use Illustrator for vectors.
<Maeni> Well true, Celestia, photoshop isn't very vector-like :/ but it does have pen tool so at least it has some
<Flamester> I dont know why people use photoshop for them.
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> i cant get used to illustrator... the tools dont work right...
<midnightshadow> Peabnuts123: thanks. you're buttering me up though. im not that good.
<SimonMagus82> how can I see your cAms>
<Flamester> Sadness
<Revolver> Hello again.
<Maeni> Photoshop works for everything
<SimonMagus82> can only see mind
<Donitz> I tried using inkscape
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> also i would then need to but Illustrator!
<Peabnuts123> No really, I like your faces
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> buy
<Donitz> but it's just so much easier to use gimp
<Peabnuts123> They are different
<Flamester> I learned it in my advertising and design class
<Peabnuts123> It's easy enough to copy someone's style
<Revolver> I draw ponies, but they turn out like this.
<Maeni> Just yesterday, I discovered content aware scaling and "puppet warp"... Lolz were had
<Revolver> http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Pony11001.jpg
<Flamester> I havent drawn a pony.
<Barry> Don't you mean "busting your haunch"?
<Flamester> yet.
<Rust> I pony pony pony
<Peabnuts123> I just photo'd my pony drawings
<SimonMagus82> anyone? helpme?
<Pearly> ponyyyyyyyyyy ponyy.
<Revolver> How am I even supposed to vector that?
<Maeni> .. Hey, I actually like that style
*Rust hugs Evil_Overlord_Celestia
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> I like your style Revolver!
<Peabnuts123> I spent time getting them right
<Balloons> http://i53.tinypic.com/317clxe.png
<Revolver> Yay.
<Donitz> my only pony http://donitz.deviantart.com/#/d3ibf12
<Maeni> Simon.. ?
<SimonMagus82> private me if you know how to work this
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Thanks Rust!
<Flamester> oh, thats easy
<Barry> The flank is closer to the leg than the haunch is.
<Peabnuts123> and I had mucho reference material
<Peabnuts123> http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v41/peabnuts123/ponyPictures.png
<Flamester> I can vector that.
<Balloons> My attempt at luna its bad xP
<Rust> yay pony
<Barry> but the haunch is closer to the rear
<Maeni> CHAT TOO FAST
<Pearly> i like it balloons
<Peabnuts123> lolol
<Pearly> izgood.
<Flamester> We should have a pony art subroom.

<Maeni> Pearly, it's cute, but those legs XD
<Hipster_Brony> 8eh, either way
<Pearly> :B
<Donitz> lol, Hamster Dash
<Peabnuts123> lolcats
<Hipster_Brony> 8he said flank because thats what ass wordfilters to on Ponychan
<Flamester> That one might be a bit harder to vectorize cause of the curlyness rev.
<Pearly> lmao donitz
<Revolver> http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Pony4001.jpg
<Revolver> Whoops.

<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Yeah i like your stuffs Revolver!
<Peabnuts123> These are my ponies
<Pearly> yeah it is
<Barry> maybe, but tail or flank would be better substitutes
<XFM_6427> you guys really seem to like ponies
<Revolver> That was my first drawing.
<Pearly> yeah i'm horrible at drawing midnight lol.
<Peabnuts123> I couldn't nail Twilight
<Balloons> Thanks.

<Flamester> Revolver, mind if I try to vectorize the first one you linked?

<Rainbow_Dash0> SHE is supposed to PROTECT ponies from mares like me.
<Barry> There are some low budget movies I like, so I may come back after Se7en to check it out
<Rainbow_Dash0> Did it work?
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Rainbow Dash i know about your 'fillyfoolery' i have pix!
<Rainbow_Dash0> If PEABLES is correct, then no!
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> so you should get banished
<Rainbow_Dash0> Banishing me would put a word on YOU!
<Peables> as a fair and decent ruler.
<Rainbow_Dash0> As a FAILURE to your OWN job!
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Really? *sarcastic* OH NOES!
<SilverSonic> lol
<Peables> She is UPHOLDING the law!
<Rainbow_Dash0> Lolyeah.
<lightumbreon|mibbit> BRB, Dinner

<Espeon> 06http://wildcritters.ws/data/6298ea80ed1adbf8941d13c7095bff12.jpg?1308408065 what
<Rainbow_Dash0> Pfft.
<Peables> We have a death, do you not agree banishment is a fair punishment?
<Murasaki> Wait.
<Rainbow_Dash0> I didn't see her PREVENT the death.
<Peables> lol hai murasaki!
<Rainbow_Dash0> As her duty goes as GOD!
<Hipster_Brony> 8its a horrible, godawful movie with no cinematic value whatsoever
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Im not a freaking Superhero!
<Rainbow_Dash0> Right.
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Im a flipping Princess
<Rainbow_Dash0> You are GOD.
<Hipster_Brony> 8basically, we're showing it because the chat is going to be fun
<Rainbow_Dash0> Only GOD.
<Peables> She was not here and, subsequently unable to attempt saving Scootaloo
<Lucas|Defender> Hey
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> Well.... erm Yo MOMMA's GOd!
<Avian> Omg, I just had this incredibly far out dream that I need to tell you guys
<Peables> I didn't see YOU try and save here, Rainbow Dash
<Lucas|Defender> Guys
<Rainbow_Dash0> God is SUPPOSED to do that sort of thing.
<Peables> You were with here at the time!
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> ...
<Lucas|Defender> GUYS
<Lucas|Defender> Look.
<Peables> Sup?
<Avian> In my dream I got to see a sneak preview of the next season of FiM
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> I now appoint LUna as onourary God!
<Lucas|Defender> Biarchy, people tends to be afraid of kings and queens
<Lucas|Defender> Ok?
<Avian> And the episode was about rainbow dash and her real origins
<Lucas|Defender> And that's normal here...
<Peables> Uh huh *listening to Avian*
<Rainbow_Dash0> Then, you can't banish me, right?
<Lucas|Defender> and sometimes you get ssick of that right Cel?
<Rainbow_Dash0> Only God can do that.
<Lucas|Defender> The Sun is tired, right?
<Avian> I know that this is most likely not going to be 100% real but it seemed real to me
<Rainbow_Dash0> ocrapI'mnotgonnareadthatfic.
<Lucas|Defender> And so, If Celestia's the ruler and powerful here...
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> *sigh*
<Avian> Basically in teh episode you find out that rainbow dash was actually adopted and lived in a far of village from couldsdale and ponyville
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> thats IT, I QUIT. I AM RETIRING!
<Peabnuts123> with Apple Bloom!
<Lucas|Defender> She can't have sole decision..
<Avian> You also found out that Rainbow Dash is only really half Pegasis
<Evil_Overlord_Celestia> TWILIGHT CAN BE PRINCESS NOW!
<Peabnuts123> Celestia is banishing HERSELF!
<Lucas|Defender> since it's a biarchy
<Rainbow_Dash0> Really?
<Rainbow_Dash0> Cool.
<Avian> Her father turns out to be a rainbow 7 tail kitsune
<Peabnuts123> lol wut
<Rainbow_Dash0> I get the palace.
<Peabnuts123> So uh
<Peabnuts123> Who changes nick to Princess_Twilight first.
<Barry> ah
<Lucas|Defender> Peab, pausing Scoot's revival is menaningless now..
<Avian> Her mother is a pegasis and her father is a 7 tail kitsune with rainboy tails
<Princess_Twilight> I WIN!
<Princess_Twilight> Oh SHI-
<Peabnuts123> LOLOLOL
<Rainbow_Dash0> Aww.
<Barry> Just out of curiosity, what's your honest opinion of Dragon Wars?
<Avian> THat was in my dream though
<Lucas|Defender> *Lucas uses Lifenoodles*
<Peabnuts123> That's pretty far out
<Peabnuts123> Avian
<Avian> But it seemed like I was watching the real show
<Scoot> 0/0hp
<Scoot> [it has no effect]
<Lucas|Defender> *Scoot is revived*
<Avian> Anyway the episode ended sadly though
<Avian> Yes peabnuts?
<Peables> Sorry i meant to add Avian to the end of my sentance but forgot
<Peables> it wasn't a new sentance
<Lucas|Defender> *breaks through and breaks Peab's pause effect*
<Hipster_Brony> 8never heard of it
<Ivan2294> Sup
<Princess_Derpy> I have overthrown Tailight!
<Rainbow_Dash0> Avian, how would that even WORK? I mean, ADOPTION? In a CHILDREN'S SHOW?
<Princess_Derpy> Muffins for all!
<Peables> Lolol
<Peables> Apple Bloom is adopted!
<Ivan2294> ...
<Ivan2294> Interesting start...
<Lucas|Defender> *Lucas uses Lifenoodles and it works! COMPLETELY on Scoot!*
<Avian> Anyway, at the end of the episode the entire village is swallowed up by mudslide killing everyone except Rainbow Dash
<Rainbow_Dash0> Apple Bloom is dead, lol.
<Scoot> 0/0hp
<Scoot> [it has no effect]
<Lucas|Defender> *Scoot is revived*\
*Princess_Derpy gives rainbow dash a muffin!
<Peables> SCOOT IS GONE FOREVER
<Lucas|Defender> Peab I know it's you, stop lying...
<Ivan2294> I don't know why I came in here right now, after all I am making a video.
<Peables> STOP TRYING TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE
<Ivan2294> Bye
<Peables> ...literally
<Peables> Bye Ican
<Peables> Ivan
<Avian> Rainbow Dash is saved by the last bit of magic from her father but it ends up giving her amnesia
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> *Teleports in*
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Hi!
<Peables> Anyways
<Peables> WHAT
<Peables> NO
*Princess_Derpy Bainishes Reconstructed Apple Bloom by accident
<Lucas|Defender> And there she comes.
<Princess_Derpy> Whoops
<Scoot> ugh....
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> *is dead*
<Princess_Derpy> ...
<Princess_Derpy> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<Avian> Sorry for the downer...
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> I'm okay.
<Avian> That's just what happened in my dream though
<Lucas|Defender> what happened?
<Princess_Derpy> YAY!
<Ali1017> yay~
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> You remember what happend, Lucas.
<Lucas|Defender> I revived scoot.
<Lucas|Defender> :)
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Y'all were there.
<Lucas|Defender> I know..
<Avian> I'm going to freak out though if it turns out my dream is right however
<Lucas> And yay.
<Silverscreen> Heard of it, but thought the box looked like crap to be honest.
<Rainbow_Dash0> ohshit.
<Lucas> Scoot isn't dead...
<Nightmare_Moon> Why is everypony dead?
<Peables> Rainbow Dash killed Scootaloo.
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> I'm dead because of Porky.
<Rainbow_Dash0> I DID NOT.
<Peables> Wait
<Peables> Since when was Apple Bloom dead
<Scoot> Um, noneof us are dead now...
<Scoot> Hm.
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Pony16001.jpg
<Damos> Hey Eccy Weccy
<Nightmare_Moon> Applebloom would've made a great minion if she were alive, a shame. I could've used her to help rebuild Everfree Castle.
<EccoCode> Hey Damos and everyone.
<Scoot> Honest, I don't think it was RD's fault...
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> (The top one is what Reconstructed Apple Bloom looks like.)
<Scoot> Not all of it...

<Peabnuts123> lolol
<Nightmare_Moon> You wound me Applebloom. I wouldn't have hurt you, just needed your help on how to get a castle overrun by the most dangerous forest in all of Equestria back on its feet.
<Peabnuts123> LATERS

<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> I don't care.
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Ah wouldn'ta left mah sister.

<Nightmare_Moon> Well, I suppose I could always just ponynap you. Fulfill some nonsensical evil villian quota or something.
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Ah guess.
<Princess_Derpy> Nightmar MOON!
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Too late now.
*Princess_Derpy le gasp
<Scoot> And scootaboot, I got to go...
<LogicalFailure> Oh, you're still here? I suppose being an internet entity would enable you to do that.
<NotSpike> Gasp le
<Nightmare_Moon> What is it Derpy? Don't you have some kind of wild goose chase of a delivery to be doing?
<Lucas> REV.
<Lucas> YOU HERE?
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Speakin' a 'evil villan quotas' mind helpin me fill mine so Ah can go be one o' the good guys?
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> (Lol, nope.)

<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> (Fine...)
*Princess_Derpy le trixie!
<Lucas> (or pringles()
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> (SPRITE()
<Lucas> (PEPSI()
<LogicalFailure> Oh dear, a Trixie.
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> (LULZ()
<Nightmare_Moon> Hmm, you hardly seem family material. I suppose you can't blame sister for being sympathetic with you.
<Lucas> (RAGE()
<Princess_Derpy> Yep i killed her Nightmare, it was so FUNNNN!
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Ya WHAT?
<Nightmare_Moon> And Applebloom, you're undead now, you'll never get your cutie mark.
<Princess_Derpy> Killed the Princess silly
<LogicalFailure> Well that's not very nice, Derpy.
<Princess_Derpy> sorry...
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Whatever.
<Lucas> Um, walk downstairs.
<Barry> Well, it was low budget
<Lucas> Please.
<Princess_Derpy> she was goona kill Dash Rainbow!
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> But like Ah said, are y'all gonna help me fufill that 'evil villan quota' thing?
<nexer> if applebloom was undead, couldn't she have the black lantern sybbol as a cutiemark?
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Ah dunno.
<Silverscreen> lol, Spider's Web doesn't even have a movie poster.
<LogicalFailure> Well, Derpy, it is much more of a punishment to have somepony locked away in an eternal prison. Like the moon.
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Ah can't take this darned coat off ta look.
<Hipster_Brony> 8nope
<Hipster_Brony> 8like i said, really low budget
<Nightmare_Moon> To behonest, I'm not sure if she's the Sally type of reconstructed or the undead type of reconstructed.
<Princess_Derpy> I buried the princess in MUFFINS!
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> http://s1223.photobucket.com/albums/dd502/Immortalshippo/?action=view&current=Pony16001.jpg
<Princess_Derpy> Alive...
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> (The top one.)
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Y'all what now?
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Would random acts of violance count as evil, y'all?
<nexer> yes
<LogicalFailure> Oh, well. I'm always free for helping the undead fill their evil quotas.
<Lucas> DOWNSTAIRS
<Lucas> Now
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Later, Lucas.
<Nightmare_Moon> Well, as this one hero said before I struck him down... "In the name of meaningless battle!"
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> *Stabs Derpy*
<Princess_Derpy> Im Imortal Silly!
<Hipster_Brony> 8http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockbuster
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> That was evil, right?
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Consarnit.
<Princess_Derpy> *regenerates*
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> *takes Derpy by the neck and dissapears*
<LogicalFailure> I suppose attacking an immortal is still an evil act. Foolish or not.
<Silverscreen> ah, one of those.
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> *comes back*
<Princess_Derpy> *comes back* hello
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> That was the moon, heh heh.
<Princess_Derpy> IM BACKK!
<Princess_Derpy> that was fun!
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> What'd sis call it?
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Irony/
<Princess_Derpy> *derp*
<Dinky> *dink*
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> *shoves Derpy to the moon again*
<Princess_Derpy> MUFFIN!
<Dinky> O:
<Barry> Well then, Spider's Web is a parody. Nothing more, nothing less
<Princess_Derpy> *telesports back*
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> *Shoves Dinky to the moon*
*Princess_Derpy rescues dinky
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> *Stabs Dinky*
<Barry> And if done right, parodies can be excellent movies all their own
<LogicalFailure> Does this happen all the time, here? ...
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> AH think.
<Princess_Derpy> Dinky is also imortal
<Princess_Derpy> silly
<Lucas> ....
<Princess_Derpy> she is my daughter
<Dinky> part hellspawn too
<Princess_Derpy> and the heir to the throne
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Consarnit, dag-nabit, dangit.
<Hipster_Brony> 8no, its pretty much a straight rip off
<Dinky> satan is my father lol
<Princess_Derpy> stabes apple bloom*
<Barry> then it's a Knockbuster
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Ah'm already dead.
<Princess_Derpy> no twilg--- i mean erm your farther is not satan...
<Hipster_Brony> 8yeah, more or less
<Barry> A Mockbuster can be termed as a parody. a Knockbuster is a simple rip off
<Lurkingear> im curios, what caused this onslaught of bronies?
<Dinky> i dunno i just got here
<Nightmare_Moon> Which onslaught?
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Great, ya got yer kinfe's blood stains all over mah gosh-darn coat!
<Princess_Derpy> Sorry applebloom
<Silverscreen> Movies like Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein are parodies.
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> Y'all better be sorry.
<Silverscreen> This looks....ugh.
<Silverscreen> I can't even watch the trailer for it.
<Barry> I haven't seen it for myself, but by your dislike, they didn't put much effort into it
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> *wiping coat*
<Nightmare_Moon> Oh qit your whining, the blood will fleck off in a few days
<Lurkingear> Derpy and Appleblooms
<Reconstructed_Apple_Bloom> I can't even take it off ta wash it.
<Barry> Maybe they could have made it into a parody with more effore
<Princess_Derpy> Oh i forgot to tell applejack is dead
<Barry> effort*
<Hipster_Brony> 8it was made so that people would confuse it with charlottes web and accidentally buy it, pretty much
<Princess_Derpy> tell you*
<Barry> That's how they work, like Transmorphers, and Land That Time Forgot
<Nightmare_Moon> You killed the element of Honesty? I don't believe you, nothing can kill the element of Honesty, she's practically a mortal goddess!
<LogicalFailure> But not immortal, I suppose.
<Nightmare_Moon> [[ Bitch be strong yo ]]
<Princess_Derpy> I killed your sister and she is an imortal goddess
<Silverscreen> Both of which I was smart enough to avoid.
<Nightmare_Moon> Celestia's on the sun, she'll be back in a few days.
<Princess_Derpy> No shes dead
<Princess_Derpy> seriously...
<aggelos_the_dragon> hi
*Ray yawns
<Princess_Derpy> i
<Princess_Derpy> like
<Lucas> ?
<Princess_Derpy> suffocated her
<Princess_Derpy> for ten years
<Princess_Derpy> With
<Princess_Derpy> muffins
*lightumbreon|mibbit is stuffed X.x
<Nightmare_Moon> You choked my sister to death with muffins for 10 years in the span of a single night?
<drf|away> 03*WB02(Ray02)03WB* - <Ray> 02I'm a walking CDC nightmare, It makes me want to hug someone

<Princess_Derpy> Yep!
<Ray> 02Thx~
<Princess_Derpy> *derp*
<uuuhhhhhhhh> who else but derpy?
<LogicalFailure> How do you move the sun, Derpy?
<Hipster_Brony> 8For your viewing displeasure: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jd_LHc54yOU
<Silverscreen> lol
<Princess_Derpy> Oh MUF--- i forgot to raise the sun....
<Silverscreen> It's got a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes
<Rainbow_Dash0> GRR, YOU KILLED APPLEJACK AND MADE MY INTERNETS DIE!
<Hipster_Brony> 8pretty sure that the narrator is heavily sedated during this trailer
<Nightmare_Moon> She didn't need to because Celestia did.
<Silverscreen> XD
<Princess_Derpy> Nightmare Moon... she is dead!
<Silverscreen> Probably had to be to get him to stay there.
<uuuhhhhhhhh> yer dead
<Princess_Derpy> You need to stop living in the past
<uuuhhhhhhhh> yer all dead
<Princess_Derpy> and get over it
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> I TAKE OVER.
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
<Nightmare_Moon> Princess_Derpy, I had my sister on the verge of death and she still managed to banish me to the moon. You can't kill Celestia.
<uuuhhhhhhhh> we are all just floating in the infinite cosmos called the planets of etheral and its made of darkness. but what you dont know is that its good for you because they are good.
<Princess_Derpy> ...
<Princess_Derpy> I am the Element of MUFFINS, i killed her!
<Hipster_Brony> 8it seriously sounds like kidnapped and drugged a college student
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> I'm going to engage an EPIC BATTLE with Derpy for the throne now.
<LogicalFailure> Wait, it still looks like Derpy has managed to at least be rid of Celestia.
<Nightmare_Moon> You kill her, and the entire natural order crumbles, falls apart, all of ponydom and the universe itself will cease to exist. It's what happenes when a god dies.
<Hipster_Brony> 8with 0 narrating ability
<LogicalFailure> That's a lot more than whatever you've accomplished, NM.
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> She did die, though, Nightmare Moon.
<Barry> Yeeeaaaahhh, it's stupid
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> And then i took over your position.
<uuuhhhhhhhh> when god dies. thats going to be my new novel im working on.
<uuuhhhhhhhh> its going to be 10000 pages
<Princess_Derpy> I am god now!
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> NO!
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> *Stabs Derpy!*
<Silverscreen> xd
<Silverscreen> XD*
<UxieLover1994> Yes! Auto-Valor!
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> NOONE CAN STOP ME!
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> AH HAH HAH HAH HAH
<Nightmare_Moon> Oh Dash, if you wish to take up the mantle of Nightmare, you realize you'll be becoming nothing more than an avatar of my will.
<Hipster_Brony> 8mods finally got /meta/ cleaned up
<UxieLover1994> 13Opps, forgot to color my text!
<Silverscreen> sweet.
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> Nuh-uh.
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> You died.
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> My turn.
<Nightmare_Moon> Where you refuses to join to shadowbolts, you'll have willingly become my tool by your own folly
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> *takes Player One controller from Nightmare Moon*

<Barry> cool
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> Oh yeah.
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> That too.
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> *takes hayshake*
<LogicalFailure> Taking somepony's food isn't really nice, but it's not entirely evil.
<Princess_Derpy> BYE EVERYONE
<LogicalFailure> Bye Derpsters.
<Nightmare_Rainbow_Dash> *Drinks*
<uuuhhhhhhhh> today i went to the gas station to get some tea and the lady behind the counter was like OMG hi sunshine! and i was like hi. and then i bought the tea and it was good. the planets of etheral are also good. did you know!? that tea is actually the pure darkmatter of loyalty and the jelly that comes from it makes you invincible!?

<Rainbow_Dash0> What?
<UxieLover1994> 13Okay. Just training the Valor Form (not a single Anti yet...)
<APPLES> On endoscopy and colonoscopy, he has patchy inflamed areas in the terminal ileum. Biopsy shows noncaseating granulomas.
<LogicalFailure_Reading> Shoot him with a shotgun. Fixed.
<Twilight0> What's the point of this again?
<APPLES> Diagnosing patients is fun?
<Twilight0> :l
<APPLES> And treating!
<APPLES> Treatment is good too.
<Twilight0> Well, I haven't read up on anatomy in FOREVER, and, uh....
<Twilight0> *scratches head while alking away*
<APPLES> Anyway, what does he have? Can't treat without a diagnosis!
<APPLES> Well, you can, but you're begging for a malpractice suit.
<UxieLover1994> 13Yes! Sora leveled up (Level 66)

<Twilight0> Stop being whiney, Rainbow Dash.

<B-Man> "If this store starts selling brony tees, my head will explode. Twice."
<SillyNilly> Does JCPenney sell themed Ts?
<B-Man> But wouldn't that make your heart stop for a second or so?
<B-Man> They have Angry Bird tees.
<B-Man> Among others.

<Apokalipse> hello

<tristantoxique> and the natural vibrato of strings
<Pearly> Yez
<Pearly> Timeto draw twilight sparkle
<tristantoxique> but basically I chose chords that can't possibly be in the same key musically, which gives it that eerie fear to chromaticism
<Pearly> Ooh, i see. even better than.
<UxieLover1994> 13Anti Form's terrible if it involves defence. I'm not Paul from the Pokemon anime, y'know
<tristantoxique> /end music rant
