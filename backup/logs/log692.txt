<The_Awesomeness> im going to stick up lost cat signs but it doesnt have a collor so im kinda doubtful its owner will come looking for it
<Rex_Mundi> Saturn: Maybe you need to plug in your computer, is that the problem?:P
<Shizuka> 13this is why we don't ninja streams -_-#
<Kandarihu> The_Awesomeness, well enjoy your kitty. Considering you rescued off the street, it's going to thank you for the rest of it's now-prolonged life.
<JRP> Saturn: give it a sec
<pot80> I think its probably because of the skydive thing and now the internets is all crowded up o.O
<JRP> Saturn: no it dosent seem to be showing mica stream
<The_Awesomeness> it was starved when i found it so i doubt it wouldve lasted much longer
<Kandarihu> pot80, the internet is getting lagged from everyone obsessing with the supersonic skydive?
<Saturn> 08,01okay
<Saturn> 08,01one more try

*MadSurge has met Saturn irl and EET WUZ GWEAT
<flufflepuff> more like 20
<thelonepony> Saturn: your a Killing Machine :3
*pot80 turns off barbershop and unmutes
<Rex_Mundi> We should all hug Saturn *hugs saturn*
<ASoftFluffyThing> MadSurge, envy
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol i remember seeing a mod of doom w/ megaman sprites and was a deathmatch style thing,really cool
<Dark_Horst> he's having fun
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn and Wrek should play Doom together. See who gets the most kills.
<GilDash> Saturn: Your sound is lagging behind your audio.
<Rex_Mundi> are there dfferences in the level desighns for the dfferent versions of doom, i mean big ones.
<GilDash> Or maybe not..
<Michael> lawl
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> barrels? lol insert Pewdie Pie here :D
<MadSurge> Barrels o'Fun :D
<thelonepony> i fine Saturn voice cute
<Rex_Mundi> amazing how many open radioactive barrels are just placed randomly about this facility
<ASoftFluffyThing> thelonepony, so do I.
<MadSurge> I love Saturn's laugh :D
<Michael> my very first FPS :D
<pot80> love the shotgun you can one shot everything until level 4 or something
<GilDash> Doom is practically the origin of today's FPSs.
<Rex_Mundi> i gotta go, hopefully ill be back later
<pot80> bye Rex_Mundi
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> cya Rex_Mundi
<Michael> bye Rex_Mundi
<killerpony7733> GilDash But most do not keep to that root. Doom had enemy variety COD doesn't for example
<GilDash> Saturn vs. Wrek on a Doom Deathmatch? Oh, yes please. :D
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Hey, I didn't say they all improved on it! :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> GilDash: Lots of blood
<GilDash> if you've never played Doom, go and bloody play it.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> GilDash: idk i was thinkin of the Megaman Deathmatch w/ ALL the Mods! :D
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: you might wanna lower
<GilDash> Sketch_Toku_Brony: To be honest, when I think of Deathmatch the first thing that comes to mind is the old Unreal Tournament.
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: the volume of doom
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: gets hard t understand when you start shooting
<GriffonCherry|Maid> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbqlmn7lBS1rbonovo1_1280.jpg
<pot80> yes it is XD wow this feels kind of weird because he can read the comments
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: much better
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> GilDash: oh i meant this doom mod i saw on YT and it looked pretty fun,lol plus ya can play as any boss from MM
<GilDash> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Fair enough. Never played MegaMan. :S
<pot80> damn you buffer
<Eli> GriffonCherry|Maid: i would do the same if my best friend would die
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> GilDash: :O huh?!
<GilDash> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Before my time.
<GriffonCherry|Maid> Eli: THE MANLIEST TEARS! ;^;
<MadSurge> http://i.imgur.com/gpdj4.jpg :D Twilight is shifting planes!
<Michael> MadSurge: omg
<pot80> 1% health lol
<Eli> GriffonCherry|Maid: i think mlp already made me shed my manliest tears, but yeah
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> GilDash: oh well there are many megaman games on DS and stuff though those arent Original MM
<MadSurge> http://i.imgur.com/X4ESM.jpg nope, everything's normal, it's Pinkie being Pinkie.
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/2yToX.jpg dawww
<JRP> Saturn: the aim is not to die
<BladedWings|AFK> MadSurge: that last mouth looks evil lol
<Eli> i think what doom is to you supermario64 is that to me Saturn :)
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> anyone played Haunting Ground on ps2? saw a hard mode playthrough and MAN does it look like TRUE survival horror :$
<GilDash> Saturn: Don't forget to kill everything! And make it to the next level! :p
<thelonepony> Michael: <3
<pot80> in what game is the aim to die? apart from karoshi of course :P
<Jesse_> What game is this?
<Zephyr> Jesse: Doom
<pot80> Jesse_: DOOM!?!?
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/on920.png dat chrysalis
<Zephyr> is he playing a source port?
<pot80> damnit Zephyr
<Chrysalis> ?
<Zephyr> no mouselook or jump =P
<Eli> Michael: she looks cute in an apron
<GilDash> Doom's story: Demons invaded. Kill them all. Pretty much it. XD
<Michael> Eli: IKR?
<Ponyloverforever1> is that guy on the bottom chucky or somthing
<killerpony7733> GilDash doom 3 tried to do that different
<thelonepony> thats doom guy
<Zephyr> back when fps games didn't have stories, you just killed stuff and moved on the next level
<Ponyloverforever1> oh
<thelonepony> so true Zephyr
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Now, I like Doom 3. I really, really do. It's not quite "Doom" to me though.
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/FzAzz.gif to much dawww on this
<alexxm> dust monster?
<Shizuka> 13inb4 nopony here remembers my doom 3 stream... or nittany's for that matter..
<killerpony7733> GilDash Oh yeah Doom 3 was indeed a good game from most games due to keeping to most of it's roots though it really really tried too hard with jump scares but the atmosphere was good
<thelonepony> Michael: :3 cute
<killerpony7733> Shizuka I did
<killerpony7733> I remember enjoying it a ton
<pot80> boom headshot
<Rustymeat> Oh saturn stream
<DashWithRainbows> Shizuka I remember you using the shotgun a lot.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Never finished Doom 3.
<GilDash> killerpony7733: Doom 3's biggest failing was the heavy use of scripted scenes. It made it the same game on every playthrough.
<GilDash> Shizuka: I remember!
<Michael> thelonepony: the animations are just aweseme
<Kandarihu> Hooray for Portal 2
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka used cheats. I didnt'.
<killerpony7733> GilDash Oh yeah that.
<Michael> *awesome
<Chrysalis> Saturn have you seen Wracked?
<thelonepony> It is Michael
<Shizuka> 13only godmoded once .-.
<GilDash> killerpony7733: If they'd focused more on actually gameplay AI, I think it could have been even better.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Scripting is a problem with mainstream shooters.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wish FPSs evolved into games more like Turok 2 and less like CoD.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At least SP-wise.
<GilDash> Oh, Turok 2... what a game.
<alexxm> i find it pretty awesome that one guy takes on the armies of hell
<Zephyr> Wow thanks for reminding me of Turok
<GilDash> Never did get to finish that... :(
<Zephyr> amazing level design
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I beat Turok 2 twice.
<Michael> Gnight everypony HF with Doom!
<Eli> Nittany_Discord: or black
<thelonepony> Night Michael :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Non-linear level design. Fun weapons. Good story. Good music.
<GilDash> Michael: G'night! :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Black was fun as well.

<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: what the fuuuu
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: that was fast
<Eli> Shizuka: personally, i think he's an idiot
<MadSurge> Sketch_Toku_Brony: luckily it's probably just Pinkie being weird, and not... the manga's reason.
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: hell yeah
<BladedWings|AFK> Shizuka: saw that earlier today lol
<oGriofa> I don't know if this is a good idea or not, but we should get togetehr somtime and all play minecraft hungergames challenge together.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: perfect "I regret nothing!" gif
<pot80> omg yes if i actually had minecraft :'(
<Eli> MadSurge: be careful with that phrase
<MadSurge> Eli: ?

<The_Awesomeness> the multipul reality princepal allows for someone to go back in time and kill themselves
<The_Awesomeness> thats alot of fucking up
<pot80> The_Awesomeness: i think that may have come out wrong
<The_Awesomeness> yeah it might have
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> The_Awesomeness: so the movie Looper? lol
<The_Awesomeness> well its like how there is an infinte amount of ralites based on actions that happen every second it also works through time

<GilDash> Why are only half of them in jumpsuits? :S
<SirGanjalf> *parallel
<alexxm> well that was quick
<pot80> i dont think a toilet is the right place of one of these scenes
<The_Awesomeness> when you go back in time u enter a reality were u went back in time and when you kill youself from the past you create a parallel reality were u killed yourself but u still survive as yourself from the reality were you didnt kill yourself

<Chrysalis> awesome
<oGriofa> Saturn: I can play those on guitar.
<BroPony|MEDIC> alexxm: Things are goin great :)
<Chrysalis> i want to support smile smile smile
<Lasharus> Saturn, you sick, sick person.
<Lasharus> (In the case of the former, that is)
<Chrysalis> but gangnam has a stronger chance of resisting the bieber
<ekips> I just tuned in, what the fuck is going on
<Dark_Horst> so the comics he draws manipulate people. i knew it
<Chrysalis> this is the youtube version of tactical voting
<Saturn> 08,01Lasharus: it was fun to learn
<Lasharus> Sorry, I have an in-built hatred for things like Gangnam Style. :P
<Saturn> 08,01it's only a few chords; took me approximately 30 seconds to figure out
<ekips> What is on stream?
<Chrysalis> Lasharus which do you hate more
<Chrysalis> bieber or gangnam
*pot80 dances gangnam style
<Lasharus> 'hate more' is a relative term.
<Chrysalis> yes
<Chrysalis> then give the relative answer
<Chrysalis> id rather gangnam keep the top spot
<Chrysalis> than let bieber take it
<DerpyMuffins> The lip sync off for anyone?
<twilight_sprinkle> whats the point of getting people all to vote on one day
<twilight_sprinkle> why not just tell them go like that video
<oGriofa> DerpyMuffins: For me yea.
<twilight_sprinkle> you only get 1 dislike anyway
<Chrysalis> a) you can only like a vid once
<kidzrul434> I wish Pinkie Pie ran her own bakery! I would never leave!
<twilight_sprinkle> yes so why tell people when to go vote
<Chrysalis> b) its something to do with how youtube tracks popular videos
<Saturn> 08,01is the sync any better now?
<Chrysalis> 460 million views
<Chrysalis> holy cow
<ekips> What is on stream?
<Dark_Horst> misfits
<thelonepony> ekips: misfits
<Vash> hello! what's streaming?
<Saturn> 08,01Vash: misfits
<twilight_sprinkle> well if everyone votes on the same day, id think all it would do is give it most popular of one day, but i dont know how the outube vote thing works
<thelonepony> Hi Vash the stampede :3
<ekips> thanks
<ekips> I'm not sure if I like what I'm watching yet.
<Vash> thelonepony its a shame more people don't get the ref
<thelonepony> i know
<twilight_sprinkle> also i hate gangam as much as bieber, so screw that
<thelonepony> people have to see trigun
<Stary> Hi everyone! :)
<alexxm> how are things Stary
<thelonepony> Hi Stary :)
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Stary
<alexxm> inb4 her nans barely 40
<Saturn> 08,01i love Gangnam Style
<Vash> 'ello
<Saturn> 08,01the video is absolutely hilarious
<Saturn> 08,01the tune is catchy
*Chrysalis does the gangam style
<Saturn> 08,01what's not to love?
<Stary> Nice to see you again thelonepony :3
<thelonepony> :3
<Luigifan365> I also like it
<Lasharus> The song, the melody, the dance, and everything related to it, Saturn.
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: its insanely primitive, and its simple catchiness promotes generic simple pop music
<Vash> so what is Misfits about?
<Lasharus> twilight_sprinkle, may I commend you on your good taste? :P
<Stary> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Vash: heroes only less pretty
<thelonepony> Wait, wheres nathan?
<Dark_Horst> no idea
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: so? i didn't say it's the height of high brow entertainment, but it *is* catchy
<twilight_sprinkle> Lasharus: depends, is that sarcasm?:P
<cachi01> hi everypony :) misfits?
<Stary> I for one agree with Saturn
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: well you asked whats not to like, so i said why i hate it
<Lasharus> You hate Gangnam Style, I hate Gangnam Style, I approve of your sense of taste. No sarcasm involved, for once. :P
<Saturn> 08,01i guess
<cachi01> did they saved the inmortal guy that was buried?
<Saturn> 08,01well, each to their own
<twilight_sprinkle> Lasharus: /) then :D
<Saturn> 08,01i like it for what it is
<cachi01> BULLSHIT
<Stary> What movie/show is this?
<Saturn> 08,01but it's nothing more than what it is
<Vash> aha take on me flashback!
<Lasharus> twilight_sprinkle: (\
<ekips> dafuq
<cachi01> dem not enough budget scenes
<ekips> I think I had to watch the whole series if I wanted to understand what's going on
<Lasharus> Fair enough, Saturn. I just have a built-in hatred of memes, or songs that become memes, and so on.
<DerpyMuffins> How small is the budget?
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: in a way it kind of is more than just a song, when a simple pop song becomes This popular, all other companies will try to exploit the same simplicity, in other words, pop is once again on the top of music
<Stary> ekips: Yeah
<cachi01> DerpyMuffins: 100 dollars lol
<Lasharus> Any meme stopped being funny about a year before it became a meme.
<Stary> Even I don't get it >_<
<cachi01> Lasharus: not dolan
<cachi01> Lasharus: not troll face
<Lasharus> ...wot.
<Lasharus> You're trying to argue that trollface is still funny?
<cachi01> it is
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: i think that's less to do with the industry, and more to do with the people listening to it. it's always been like that; there have always been simplistic stupid things in vogue
<Lasharus> I may have to back out now, before I grab a flamethrower.
<Lasharus> The size of a small city.
<twilight_sprinkle> trollface can be good, but its so horribly over- and mis-used
<Stary> twilight_sprinkle: Eeyup..
<Lasharus> On exceptionally rare occasions, it's used right and amusingly. In practically all others, it's not, and not.
<cachi01> yep trollface is fun http://bwaff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/slenderman-facebook-account.png
<Lasharus> twilight_sprinkle, stop echoing me. It's freaky. :P
<cachi01> trolling is fun
<Dark_Horst> ist that the power.dealer?
<twilight_sprinkle> Lasharus: im in yo head, stealin yo thoughts (ironically, this is a meme:D)
<Lasharus> That statement makes me want to slap you cachi01. :P
<Stary> cachi01: I'm guessing that you troll?
<cachi01> Stary: yep :) but just in facebook and while im playing videogames
<Lasharus> People are either idiots or trolls these days. Considering that I feel that trolls are synonymous with idiots, it doesn't really count as a saving grace. Ever.
<Bunny_Striker> BRITISH ACCENTS!
<Stary> cachi01: Heh, I'm sure we all do sometimes :)
<cachi01> eeyup lol
<cachi01> brb eating tacos
<Lasharus> I think I prefer to just be a cynical git. It serves me better.
<Stary> Hey Saturn does Luna ever go online? o-o
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: but the songs tremendous popularity, which is indeed caused by the people who made it a huge internet meme, demonstrates how simple pop is an easy machine. just when you think people are getting sick of pop, this comes out. only pop music gets This famous nowadays
<Lasharus> It's why I prefer gaming music in many cases, twilight_sprinkle.
<brony2447> hello everypony!
<Stary> twilight_sprinkle: same here
<Lasharus> Mainstream music, at the risk of sounding like a hipster, is becoming exceptionally bog-standard and boring.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I found that being cynical did nothing but wind me up, make me jump to conclusions, and obtain a borderline personality. Didn't like it.
<Stary> hi brony2447 :3
<thelonepony> Hi brony2447 :3
<Bunny_Striker> twilight_sprinkle: I hate pop, ROCK MUSIC FOREVER!
<Lasharus> Nittany_Discord, the trick is to be cynical, yet amused by it. :P
<thelonepony> ohai Bunny_Striker :3
<God> hello everypony
<Dark_Horst> she can see through other poeple'S eyes now
<twilight_sprinkle> i myself prefer classical and orchestral stuff mostly, and some individual songs from various genres :P
<brony2447> i just found out there is a brony convention coming to houston! IM SO HAPPEH!!!
<Dark_Horst> that might come in handy
<Lasharus> There's no point in being cynical and in a bad mood about everything. That's a recipe for sadness.
<Stary> Hi God
<Stary> XD
<Bunny_Striker> POLICE SEARCH WARRANT
<DerpyMuffins> Dat fail hacking
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think I'll pass on being cynical. I don't want to make any more uninformed opinions.
<Stary> You've all heard that Season 3 is coming out in November right? :)
<Lasharus> That's fair enough Nittany_Discord.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm sure those two are mutually exclusive though.
<Lasharus> Far be it from me to tell someone how to be.
<twilight_sprinkle> ...
<twilight_sprinkle> really
<Lasharus> I just prefer sarcasm and cynicism. I just try not to annoy people with it, but rather to amuse.
<twilight_sprinkle> he draws what happens?
<God> why do we have ads of russian girls loving americans on this site anyway
<AwsomeNick> Wut?
<Stary> *shrugs*
<twilight_sprinkle> so wait, i just turned on stream, but is this right, he draws the future?
<Bunny_Striker> HE KNOWS!!!!!
<Stary> Maybe they like to have those kind of ads? o-o
<AwsomeNick> i have never experianced that lol xD
<Saturn> 08,01he's like inverted Isaac Mendez
<Bunny_Striker> LAG!
<Bunny_Striker> VEVA! LAS VEGAS
<twilight_sprinkle> hows he inverted?
<Saturn> 08,01twilight_sprinkle: what he draws comes true
<twilight_sprinkle> isaac drew the future too
<Stary> O_o
<twilight_sprinkle> ok
<Saturn> 08,01instead of what happens to be true being drawn

<Rex_Mundi> https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/309227_270486429737381_26929361_n.jpg
<Everlasting_Joy> What are we watching?
<Jesse_> Make the douche stop trying to make out with her.
<cachi01> ./
<cowvarkian> Everlasting_Joy: a silly nazi alternate reality of misfits
<cachi01> o/ heil celestia
<twilight_sprinkle> yay incompetence
<Dark_Horst> so how come they arent speaking german
<Dark_Horst> little logic flaw here
<Stormy> Lambduh / Lambdur whichever you're using
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: because of a reason
<twilight_sprinkle> cause we couldnt understand it
<Jesse_> Tyranny
<cowvarkian> Dark_Horst: because subtitles and german lessons are expensive
<doctor_whooves127> also hitlers dead so why are there still nazis?
<cachi01> Dark_Horst: u thin this show has enough budget to afford subtitles?
<Saturn> 08,01doctor_whooves127: the jew didn't kill him
<Dark_Horst> doctor_whooves127: becasue he won
<Everlasting_Joy> doctor_whooves127: Do you think his empire would die with him?
<Lambdur> Yes'm?
<doctor_whooves127> yes
<flutterchu> doctor_whooves127: *sigh* some people are too much of dia hard fans of anything
<twilight_sprinkle> so wheres the immortal douchebag?
<flutterchu> *die
<DerpyMuffins> Isn't hitler dead by now?
<Dark_Horst> twilight_sprinkle: vegas
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I am the man that arranges the tanks that make all of the Nazis keep away.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dark_Horst: figures lol
<Jesse_> Not the hot girl!
<Stormy> :P
<Jesse_> Don't kill the hot girl!
<Saturn> 08,01but the Nazis won the war because of technology from the mobile phone
<Stormy> Never mind
<twilight_sprinkle> dat tetris
<cachi01> E.T. CALL HOME!
<Stormy> Did you know your quit message says "row, row, row your boat"?
<cowvarkian> Derpy_Hooves: clones
<Barbetos> She can grow her finger nails really long
<DerpyMuffins> ded
<cachi01> GENIUS
<Dark_Horst> dakka'd#
<Jesse_> ouch
<cowvarkian> Saturn: technology they probably couldnt even use
<flutterchu> so......ive seen a few episodes.....what exacly is this show about
<doctor_whooves127> but how the tech would be next to useless
<twilight_sprinkle> i actually dreamt of Heroes today
<Lambdur> Yep
<Saturn> 08,01cowvarkian: on the contrary; there are several things in the phone that could have influenced the war, even if only through inspiring scientists
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: have you ever seen Heroes
<Lambdur> Hang on a sec
<Stormy> oh
<cachi01> they won because having a nokia = world's hardest material
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: um......no
<Stormy> thought it might be a default one
<Ponies47> Hello everypony!
<Dark_Horst> already the fact that it had was a computer
<Lambdur> My app is being word
<cowvarkian> Saturn: please do go on
<cachi01> hi Ponies47
<Lambdur> Weird
<Saturn> 08,01not necessarily duplicating the technology, but attempting to
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Ponies47!
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: ok well short version is its about people with superpowers
<cowvarkian> Saturn: and making a shitty chinese knock off?
<thelonepony> Hi Ponies47 :)
<cowvarkian> by chinese I mean german
<flutterchu> twilight_sprinkle: understandable enough
<Dark_Horst> they would get the knowladge how to built advanced computers fromt hat phone decades before veryone else
<Lambda> Back
<cowvarkian> or chinese, they still exist
<Dark_Horst> that's one huge advantage in wars
<Saturn> 08,01cowvarkian: they could have got integrated circuits from that. just the basics, but enough to be influencial
<Everlasting_Joy> Is the video/sound sync off for anyone else?
<oGriofa> Why didnt the guy just use a gun to kill hitler anyway?
<Jesse_> Can we forget the logical flaws and just find the show entertaining?
<DerpyMuffins> Its the clones again
<cowvarkian> Saturn: whatever you say, george
<cachi01> oGriofa: logic
<flutterchu> oooh........(c) nintendo.......?
<cachi01> and inception again
<cowvarkian> oGriofa: I don't know why he didnt just kill baby hitle
<Stormy> Eating now, brb
<oGriofa> damn you logic, why dont you work in tv shows
<cowvarkian> *hitler
<Dark_Horst> oGriofa: becasue you cant buy guns at every corner in britain
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Lambda> K
<Jesse_> L....ol....
<twilight_sprinkle> wow thats some serious incompetence
<cachi01> Dark_Horst: he brought a fucking cellphone to the past why not a gun?
<cowvarkian> Just kill baby hitler, that'll solve all our problems
<cowvarkian> cachi01: because england
<Dark_Horst> cachi01: probably becasue he ddnt have a guj
<Dark_Horst> gun
<oGriofa> Dark_Horst: He was going to go kill hitler, you would think he would just go invest in one in sweden.
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: he robably couldnt get a gun
<Bunny_Striker> back, computer crashed
<cachi01> Dark_Horst: he has fucking superpowers he could just go steal a gun from a cop idk
<Jesse_> Duh duh duh
<cowvarkian> so, this is all just going to be a shitty dream sequence, right
<doctor_whooves127> also how is there still a resistance
<cowvarkian> doctor_whooves127: magic
<cachi01> doctor_whooves127: hope
<cowvarkian> all of the above
<Jesse_> Lets just find the show entertaining! XD
<cowvarkian> Jesse_: fuck that
<cachi01> dem peelz
<doctor_whooves127> wait what about the brainwashy chick?
<cachi01> ALCOHOL YAY
<Brony_Pony26> im back

<thelonepony> wb Brony_Pony26
<Brony_Pony26> thanks
<cowvarkian> and do we not develop atomic bombs?
<Brony_Pony26> misfists right
<prince-dari> cowvarkian: Why are you bothering to debate the semantics?
<prince-dari> It's a TV show.
<Jesse_> We didn't use atomic weaponry on Germany.
<prince-dari> People in it have super powers
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: because I have nothing better to do
<prince-dari> Is that realistic?
<cowvarkian> Jesse_: we could've
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: cause it can be itneresting
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: might as well be
<cachi01> fucking murrica government. killing inocent japanese people
<doctor_whooves127> 1.get cellphone 2. 3. win war/profit
<Brony_Pony26> wonderbal
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: indeed that was dumb, but why are you brining it up
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: because I sortof brought it up
<oGriofa> wouldnt everyone speak german if germany won over.
<oGriofa> ?
<Brony_Pony26> how do i get the adverts of my screen
<cachi01> oGriofa: TELEVISIOOOOOOON
<prince-dari> Yes, but it's an English TV show.
<twilight_sprinkle> oGriofa: we wouldnt understand it thouh
<Dark_Horst> oGriofa: they would, if this had a higeher budget
<prince-dari> And we don't all speak German in England.
<AJIsAwesome> Brony_Pony26: Adblock. Either that or they'll time out.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Brony_Pony26: Download adblock plus.
<doctor_whooves127> maybe it was to much work to inforce language
<oGriofa> prince-dari: im aware of that
<alexxm> so if the nazis took over why are is curtis still around
<cachi01> why didnt the german dub made this episode and thats it
<cowvarkian> or maybe they all are speaking german, but its like the tardis, and we just hear an english accent
<oGriofa> good observation
<cachi01> ^^
<twilight_sprinkle> so whats he doing?
<twilight_sprinkle> is he giving out powers?
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: he's taking them
<thelonepony> stealing ut

<cachi01> u know what that means.........kill him
<cowvarkian> FINISH HIM
<twilight_sprinkle> cowvarkian: why did the nazi guy like it being stolen
<Kandarihu> For once, an episode of Misfits that I'm not watching an wishing that I could watch.

<prince-dari> Why would it end when he dies?
<prince-dari> They have to change what he did, surely?

<cowvarkian> and had considerable time to research it...
<twilight_sprinkle> i wonder if they have nazi ponies in this timeline
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: true
<cachi01> what dafuq was that
<cowvarkian> pew pew
<cachi01> fock
<Barbetos> The driver side is on the right
<Barbetos> AG!
<cowvarkian> cachi01: a shrubbery
<cachi01> dem anonymous
<Barbetos> o_0
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<cachi01> DEM HITLERS XD
<cowvarkian> hah, hitler masks
<thelonepony> XD
<Dark_Horst> love the masks
<Jesse_> he's dead
<Brony_Pony26> heil
<twilight_sprinkle> gee i wonder who it is
<doctor_whooves127> best solder ever
<Rex_Mundi> If the nazis took over, than wouldnt the local fascist party of britian be the ones in charge?
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: wasn't hitler a socialist, and the italians fascist
<Jesse_> lol
<Dark_Horst> Rex_Mundi: no. the one in charge would be the local nazi party
<Rex_Mundi> cowvarkian: Hitler was never a socialist
<otakon28> Hiya guys
<twilight_sprinkle> hitler was a communist!
<otakon28> Whats up?
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: nazi's are the national socialist party
<Jesse_> Agile like a cat, excellent excuse.
<alexxm> seems legit
<thelonepony> hai otakon28 :)
<Shizuka> 13national socialist workers party...
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, otakon28. :)
<otakon28> Why are you talking about Hitler?
<cachi01> so the ones in charge would be this guys? http://www.elistmania.com/images/articles/259/Original/The_Nazi_Party.jpg
<otakon28> Hiya Shizuka
<Dark_Horst> otakon28: becasue stream
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: there we are
<otakon28> Uh huh
<Ralin> The nazi's weren't actually socialist.
<weeping_pegasi82> what are we watching?
<Rex_Mundi> cowvarkian: Cleverly named so in order to get some of the lower class into his party, wasnt really socialist. fascism was most popular with middle-class, not lower class.
<Bunny_Striker> otakon28: why do you have a 28 in your name?
<Shizuka> 13cause this is the internet and because godwins law
<otakon28> What is on stream?
<thelonepony> Misfits
<Dark_Horst> otakon28: misfits
<doctor_whooves127> misfits
<otakon28> Shizuka: figures
<sonicdude558> "ahem" The Misfits
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: we've been discussing hitler since the beginning of the episode
<Brony_Pony26> actually god dosent win if there is no proof he is real
<otakon28> Yh the 28 means on tablet
<Zawan> so this hitler thing, has it gone on for many episodes or just this one?
<cachi01> well you fucked it up oldman
<twilight_sprinkle> wow, the jew guy must feel like sh*t after what hes done
<Dark_Horst> this one
<doctor_whooves127> one
<cowvarkian> Zawan: just this one
<otakon28> Anyway just popping in, brb
<Jesse_> I don't understand why he doesn't just go back and time and kill him again.
<alexxm> this is why you should have taken a gun
<Bunny_Striker> Brony_Pony26: Don`t talk of my religion, dude
<twilight_sprinkle> Jesse_: injured atm
<cowvarkian> Jesse_: because that would make sense
<flutterchu> so........is there a main character in this series
<Jesse_> Go back to when he was a baby and kill him without a struggle? XD
<flutterchu> ?
<cowvarkian> Jesse_: I don't understand why he didnt just kill baby hitler
<Brony_Pony26> im just saying there is no proof he could but i think he might not atheism dude
<Dark_Horst> five, actually
<cachi01> Brony_Pony26: you have proof it isnt real?
<Rex_Mundi> Fascism was really what is called third-way econonomics, neither Socialist nor capitalist. It was a hybred system. A form of state controlled Corporatism,
<cachi01> Brony_Pony26: no? then stfu
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: mmk
<Brony_Pony26> do you have proof he is real
<twilight_sprinkle> flutterchu: well no, although the nerd is becoming the super guy mainly
<sonicdude558> yay drawfriend
<cachi01> Brony_Pony26: you have proof it isnt?
<thelonepony> Shut up with religion
<Brony_Pony26> no
<cachi01> he*
<thelonepony> not in this place man
<cowvarkian> cachi01: loads of it
<Bunny_Striker> Brony_Pony26: Do you have proof he isn`t real?
<cachi01> cowvarkian: like what?
<Rex_Mundi> Hitler was most likely agnostic, at least he comes off as a vaugly agnostic semi-deist to me.
<cachi01> cowvarkian: and dont bring me that bullshit of evolution
<cowvarkian> cachi01: I could show you, but then it would violate my beliefs
<Bunny_Striker> CUTTING BANANA
<thelonepony> go somewhere else if you want to talke about Religion
<Brony_Pony26> no but you dont have any proof he is so lets just watch misfits
<Jesse_> Nazis!
<thelonepony> talk*
<Everlasting_Joy> thelonepony: Agreed.
<cowvarkian> cachi01: and no, I'm not being sincere
<sonicdude558> stream, WHY U LAG
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: video is getting laggy
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: youre religious?

<Jesse_> Gay lover lol.
<doctor_whooves127> hes not to bright
<sonicdude558> refresh
<Jesse_> Sausages?.....Really?
<Everlasting_Joy> I was waiting for that "gay is evil in Nazi Germany" line.
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: religious addict like those crzy guys that say that if they win in cod is because god helped them? no
<Barbetos> Suasage muffin.
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we should drop this subject before it gets out of hand.
<Bunny_Striker> Those guns didn`t look German
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: i just beleave in god thats it
<sonicdude558> :|
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: evolution isnt bullshit though
<cowvarkian> cachi01: so, what's with the "evolution is bullshit"
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: agreed
<Brony_Pony26> yep it isnt
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: we probably should, yeah
<cachi01> idk it seems pretty stupid because. if we come from monkeys. shouldnt our babies be born like monkeys?
<sonicdude558> someone will save- o
<thelonepony> Talk of Religion somewhere else, but here Please
<Dark_Horst> thoose aren seconds
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: no, our genes have changed, our patterns are different
<cowvarkian> cachi01: you should really learn more about genetics before you talk out of your ass
<Bunny_Striker> thats not a german gun, is it?
<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: besides, evolution doestn contradict god anyway
<Dark_Horst> Bunny_Striker: the rifles are
<twilight_sprinkle> just contradicts some bible stuff
<cachi01> twilight_sprinkle: yeah u r right
<sonicdude558> ITS U
<cachi01> still i find evolution pretty weird lol
<Bunny_Striker> STOP TALKING ABOUT GOD! IT PISSES ME THAT FUCK OFF
<Bunny_Striker> THE
<cowvarkian> twilight_sprinkle: bible's just a silly book full of myth anyways
<cachi01> OK LETS STOP
<Brony_Pony26> cachi01: put it this way if it was adam and eve alone then we are all inberd and are doing it with our relatives
<Rex_Mundi> Yes, lets go back to talking about Hitler
<twilight_sprinkle> cowvarkian: ye
<GilDash> I thought religious talks were banned from this chat?
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: lol ok

<twilight_sprinkle> yay incompetence
<cowvarkian> Bunny_Striker: thats cool
<cachi01> Brony_Pony26: same with the evolution. where do all the monkeys come from? there must be the first 2
<GilDash> Religion and politics, I thought. For usually good reasons.
<Jesse_> Not too bright........
<Dark_Horst> cachi01: mono cell organisms
<cowvarkian> Bunny_Striker: may I request a reason for thine hatred
<sonicdude558> WHAAAAT? Hitler existed? When does this show take place
<Dark_Horst> cachi01: for fuks sake, what did you do during biology class?
<doctor_whooves127> you see hitler getting ahold of a future gun would make more sense
<sonicdude558> Welp
<sonicdude558> It definately takes place in the 21st century
<Bunny_Striker> cowvarkian: you talking about the bible, it pisses me off
<twilight_sprinkle> if he weremt so incomptenet, they wouldnt have messed this up
<Brony_Pony26> no there were multiple apes and multiple other species that grew out of the molecules and atoms and they slowly started to evolve
<cowvarkian> Bunny_Striker: oh, me saying that it's basicly not all ture
<Jesse_> . . . . . . . . . . . . .
<cowvarkian> *true
<Rex_Mundi> I dont need the Bible to belive in God
<sonicdude558> Open up and say aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

<Lambda> Did he really just say that!?
<cowvarkian> blazefoot: sounded like it would be
<GilDash> blazefoot: Oh no... not that monstrosity. XD
<Lambda> How infinitely horrible!
<blazefoot> i want a copy due to the unadulterated ham
<cowvarkian> >.>
<GilDash> blazefoot: I want to know how many pigs were killed in the making of that comic.

<cowvarkian> GilDash: a bajillion
<oGriofa> i walk in my room and hear EHHHHHH and it scaredthe shit out of me
<Bunny_Striker> this game hurts my eyes
<maid_cachi01> lol
<blazefoot> it was very hammy and goofy
<blazefoot> 5000000000000 by the way
<GilDash> cowvarkian: Try a septillion. Real number, too.
<cowvarkian> GilDash: I know
<Rex_Mundi> so Saturn, it would be funny if in December, you or another sreamer were to stream the Star wars christmas special.
<blazefoot> yes
<cachi01> cowvarkian: 700,000,000?
<GilDash> cowvarkian: Though my standard numerical responce for "a lot" is 48 billion.
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: or the doctor who christmas special
<cowvarkian> GilDash: ok then
<blazefoot> GilDash, are you a fan of mister lewis "linkara" lovhaug?
<cachi01> is doctor who based irl events?
<cachi01> is mlp based irl events?
<Rex_Mundi> I wonder, does playing a game over the live stream make it funner, Saturn?
<cachi01> is superman based irl events?
<GilDash> blazefoot: No, not really. You're lucky I know of him at all.
<Rex_Mundi> oh bollucks
<blazefoot> he's awesome
<p4ngya> Rex_Mundi: im sure it does
<Stormy> what a complete and utter jerkrocket
*cachi01 imagines himself in the night in 1993
<GilDash> And then Doom 3 did it... -_-
<cachi01> do ho ho
<Rex_Mundi> I miss the 90s, sooo much.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. 90s were fun in a way.
<Kandarihu> As one who played SMB1 when the game was relatively new, I can relate to the newness of that.
<thelonepony> same here Rex_Mundi
<cachi01> i was born in 1998 goddamit
<Rex_Mundi> Born 1990, the era of N64 and Nicktoons and saturday morning cartoons.
<cowvarkian> I was born in 97...
<thelonepony> cachi01: but your still a 90's kid
<blazefoot> 96 over here
<cowvarkian> I still have seen quite a bit of 90's cartoons...
<thelonepony> 96 here
<Rex_Mundi> is it weird that i feel a little old when im only 22?
<cowvarkian> and 80's
<twilight_sprinkle> i didnt watch much tv or play many games in the 90s
<Bunny_Striker> just imagne if the remade this without the 90s graphics
<cowvarkian> I saw a crap ton of re runs
<cowvarkian> Bunny_Striker: doom 3
<GilDash> Bunny_Striker: Someone did a Doom 3 conversion mod that did just that.
<Bunny_Striker> oh
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey guys I'm back
<cowvarkian> ASoftFluffyThing: I'm sure you are
<GilDash> Saturn: I would not trust you with a rocket launcher. :p
<thelonepony> wb ASoftFluffyThing :3
<cachi01> thelonepony: yeah atleast i could play my ps1 when i was 2 years old
<Bunny_Striker> ASoftFluffyThing: NOW GET OUT! JK
<Rex_Mundi> I go to Jobcorp, and the place is filled with teanagers who dont get the references i make or remember the things i do.
<ASoftFluffyThing> cowvarkian, thelonepony, Bunny_Striker lool *hugs*
<ASoftFluffyThing> Also
<twilight_sprinkle> no strafing seems pretty annoying though
<thelonepony> cachi01: i never had a ps1, instead i had a N64
<p4ngya> im sorry but that guys face at the bottom is creeping me the hell out :D
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: thats fun
*ASoftFluffyThing scoots over to Nittany_Discord and fluffs
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: I probably would atleast get half of them
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: You can strafe though...
<cachi01> thelonepony: every morning i asked my parents to buy me a n64...
<twilight_sprinkle> oh ok
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thanks for fluffing me.
<cachi01> thelonepony: i just bought it 2 years ago :/
<sonicdude558> thatsssss a nice mic you got there Saturn... It would be such a sssssshame if something happened to it....
<ASoftFluffyThing> You're welcome, Nitt ^^
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: but then again, I spent most of my days watching cartoons and movies
<Rex_Mundi> my roomates never saw groundhog day, the classic Bill murrey movie
<cowvarkian> and playing video games
<thelonepony> well it's still fun having cachi01 :3
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: he must die
<thelonepony> one*
<cachi01> thelonepony: yeah lol
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: I've seen it like, 3 times in the past 6 months
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: In fact, running diagonally would produce a bug due to pythagoras and stuff, so you would go at about 1.3 times the normal speed.
<ASoftFluffyThing> oh Saturn, you and your laughs when you kill <3
<cachi01> thelonepony: i asked for n64. i got gamecube. i asked for n64 i got ps2 :D
<thelonepony> :D
<Rex_Mundi> I think im the only brony there, except one guy who i dont like
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: thats fun
<HURRICANE> me
<cachi01> a brony in bronystate?
<cachi01> dafuq
<cowvarkian> cachi01: he means at the job corp thing
<thelonepony> whats a brony >_>
<GilDash> Nah. Nothing bad ever happens when you pick up a level-specific item.
<blazefoot> i want a brownie!
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: lol i guess they just made the x and y speeds add
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lolol Saturn. You so silly :3
<thelonepony> blazefoot: me too :3
<blazefoot> i call dibs
<cowvarkian> I have some brownies...
<Bunny_Striker> Doom guy vs Master Chief
<cachi01> cowvarkian: oh lol
<cachi01> GilDash: yes it FUCKING DOES
<Rex_Mundi> I remember when The Mummy, was a new movie
<cachi01> Bunny_Striker: doom guy
<Dken2021> mmm, brownies, haven't had those in awhile <3
<cachi01> Bunny_Striker: doom guy wins in less than a second
<thelonepony> cowvarkian: does it have... you know >_>
<cowvarkian> thelonepony: heh, no
<thelonepony> oh :(
<blazefoot> diediediediediediediediediediediedie
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: I remember not knowing it wasnt a new movie
<GilDash> twilight_sprinkle: Basically. Doom doesn't actually have hight co-ordinates either, so shooting at something close on the x-axis but far on the y-axis gives the illusion of the projectile travelling really fast.
<cowvarkian> because I was like, 6
<GilDash> Saturn: Back when it was released, those walls looked *exactly* like circuitry. XD
<twilight_sprinkle> GilDash: yah i noticed that lol
<Bunny_Striker> cachi01: Master Chief won, check out Death battles. Master Chief has supior armor and weapons and more agile
<cachi01> IMPOSSIBRU
<cachi01> BUT ACCORDING TO DEATH BATTLES
<GilDash> Yeah, but can't Doomguy run at like 60mph?
<cachi01> STARSCREAM WINS AGAINST RAINBOW DASH
<cowvarkian> cachi01: why are we trusting the internet to be a nerd for us
<HURRICANE> no
<Bunny_Striker> cachi01: how Rainbow Dash won
<Rex_Mundi> I think older games are in some ways more immersive that new games. for some reason, Resident evil 2 has this immersion that RE1 remake, with its awesome graphics, doesnt have as much of.
<blazefoot> false my good cachi
<cachi01> wait rainbow dash won?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Viewing Musical Photos of Mewtwo on Pokemon Black.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh god...
<HURRICANE> dash won
<Bunny_Striker> cachi01: yup

<thelonepony> Bunny_Striker: she ate his spark
<Lyra`> oh god XD

<Dken2021> Rex_Mundi sure, they like ponies, we like ponies

<cachi01> if not
<cachi01> well u are not
<Rex_Mundi> Yeah, but they have been liking ponies for a long tme, and then we pop up and they are suddenly bronies now
<sparkarez> I ONLY like g4 I hate all the other ones
<cachi01> Rex_Mundi: yes if they like g4 they are bronies
<Dken2021> well, veteran fans would be a fitting term
<thelonepony> ^
<cowvarkian> cachi01: I like the old ones, mostly
<cachi01> Really? i cant stand the old ones
<Bunny_Striker> never heard of mlp until the teens reacted to it, lol

<blazefoot> i saw a forum thread on gaia

<CrimsonPhoenix> pony5807, no advertisement
<sparkarez> I can't decide whether my favorite is Rainbow Dash or Twilight
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02JRP: I'm sorry :(
<cowvarkian> sparkarez: spike is best pony
<Dken2021> pony5807 it appears non-members cannot see the content that is in the link
<CrimsonPhoenix> sparkarez, you're favortie is Rarity
<cachi01> cowvarkian: i checked my tv for my little pony and sadly. its on discovery kids but they were repeating the first episodes so i watched mlp from the first episode
<CrimsonPhoenix> your even
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: fix my sleepies

<sparkarez> party of one was my first ep
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02JRP: Go sleepies D:
<cachi01> and season 2 airs on december here in mexico

<DIK> party of 1 reminds me of the cupcakes fanfic
<cowvarkian> cachi01: but thats why you have the internet
<cachi01> eeyup
<Rex_Mundi> You think it will be like Transformers. When g5 comes around, many G4 fans will be like "G4 is the only good gen", and G5 fans will be like "G5 is better than FIM"
<cowvarkian> also, brb
<cowvarkian> Rex_Mundi: I'll probably like G5, but fuck if I know
<Dken2021> Rex_Mundi that like with every fandom with generations
<p4ngya> something tells me g5 will be crap
<sparkarez> My only fear is if MLP FIm loses it's popularity
<CrimsonPhoenix> we don't even know if G5 will have a show
<p4ngya> CrimsonPhoenix: it is inevitable o.o
<scout19_tf2> im back wuts goin on

<CrimsonPhoenix> p4ngya, almost inevitable
<Dken2021> G5 might not even come in the next 10-20 years, who knows?
<CrimsonPhoenix> let's not forget that MLP is a TOYLINE
<Rex_Mundi> hey guys, what key do you press to make typing put the letters between letters and not replacing the one in fron, i must have accidentally pressed something and its anoying.

<LadyCanary> O_______O

<thelonepony> :D
<Silver_Spoon> nameley he does ALL of this on purpose
<GigabitHarmonie> That cop theme.
<LadyCanary> Well...

<Dken2021> Silver_Spoon oh... Stefan?
<AJIsAwesome> Well, they're bucked. :D
<RDash5000> HOSTAGE SITUATION
<Silver_Spoon> Dken2021: precisely
<cachi01> 368 POINTS IN WOLFPUNCHER BEAT THAT BRONYSTATE!
<Ponies47> sub06905|TARDIS: I love you forever now (No homo) <3
<Dken2021> wolfpuncher?
<Kandarihu> It's been too long since I've last seen it. And it seems to have aged better than I could have expected.
<Rex_Mundi> *starts a small buisness with thelonepony* selling cabages to Earth Kingdom villagers*
<Kandarihu> Seen this.
<GigabitHarmonie> Silver_Spoon: Or, perhaps, he follows a set list of lines and acts that are written down on a piece of paper or booklet, sometimes known as a script?
<RDash5000> kill the hostages. then he won't have leverage
<Quick_Thinker> man its only 8:34 and yet it feels like 10 o'clock
<Silver_Spoon> GigabitHarmonie: Even better :3 Imma steal that
<VenHur> We don't have sitcoms like these anymore...

<Dken2021> VenHur yea, Tyler perry tried but....ya know.....
<Quick_Thinker> :D
<Kandarihu> RDash5000, hostages have a higher priority than the cops in this situation. And the perpetrator has lowest priority.
<GigabitHarmonie> Dken2021: Tyler Perry failed hard.
<thelonepony> okay Boss Thinker
<Rex_Mundi> VenHur: But Eurkle took over this show, it practicly became his show with the rest of the family supporting minor characters.
<Quick_Thinker> gun person... so hes a smith
<RDash5000> Kandarihu: it was just a joke...
<Rex_Mundi> thelonepony:I vote for Kandarihu, hes got buisness acumen.

<thelonepony> Hi flutterchu
<sub06905|TARDIS> warning wolfsplosion, wolfsplosion!
<Dken2021> nah, imo, it would count as borderline fanservice
<cowvarkian> thelonepony: but that's happened before, and... yeah

<Dken2021> s
<oGriofa> asdfghjkl;'

<cachi01> BTW if u see CCM in wolfpuncher boards thats me
<Cypresswolf> Ev'ry day we're buffering
<Rex_Mundi> The intro to Karin, the chibi vampire is the most blatent fanservice ive ever seen

<thelonepony> wanted to talk to you i mean
<prince-dari> Well if there's no stream, fine
<PsychoticDoc> you guys gonna stream walking dead?
<Rex_Mundi> twilight_sprinkle: Yeah, but it really is over hyped and formulaic. No good character ever dies, ever. Its just DBZ fights with less tension. The villain is made of plastic and has no personality or faults or real motivation. The redeaming qualities of the show is the animation and characters.
<BaconMane> 0,5Well if there's no stream, fine
<prince-dari> ...

<twilight_sprinkle> cachi01: well if you can easily afford it, then buy it i guess
<Kandarihu> But if that thing is called something other than Battle Frontier, that would be a spoiler to me.

<Bronysith> simon the digger <3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohhh well i'll keep looking someone who wants it :3
<otakon> cowvarkian: ALL endings are cliche, and FLCL's was NOT silly in any case...well no more than the rest of the show
<taoumi> super mario world 2 cowvarkian :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 do you want a copy of the ship ?
<cowvarkian> taoumi: hmm
<otakon> besides GL did NOT have a cliche ending
<otakon> not by a long shot
<Phase4> 00,02?
<taoumi> *troll face*
<Ponies47> INB4: TheGreatAndPowerfulT ends up asking everyone
<otakon> MOKUUUUUUUUUUUUU!
*Bronysith licks taoumi s nose
<cowvarkian> otakon: yeah right, flcl not having a silly ending
<taoumi> hallo there Bronysith *hugs*
<twilight_sprinkle> GL is meh
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ponies47 you want one ? i have two
<otakon> cowvarkian: no sillier than the rest of the show
<Phase4> 00,02oh THAT game, seen that before
*Bronysith drills twilight_sprinkle in the nose
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: what is your reasong that GL is meh?
<Ponies47> What's the game about?
<cowvarkian> otakon: doesnt mean it wasnt silly
<Ponies47> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: ^
<otakon> ValtheJean: the hell was that...thing that popped up?
<cowvarkian> otakon: but yeah
<taoumi> OMG NOOOOO not the Eureka seveN movie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> scroll a little there is a steam link in chat
<taoumi> it was terible
<Bronysith> otakon: he doesnt enjoy good anime
<Dken2021> I
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: well from what i saw, i was mediocre story and cahracters and lotsa fanservice
<ValtheJean> 2,14 in the movie, the Nirvash has a....thing
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: how far did you get?
<cachi01> FANSERVICE FTW
<taoumi> and the nirvash never got homeinglazors
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Phase4 yep, want it ?
<cachi01> ValtheJean: penis?
<otakon> ValtheJean: it really isn't explained is it?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 the movie sucks ass
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: whatever was shown, several eps i think
<otakon> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: who me?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: better than just being a deathnote ripoff like code geass
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: code geass is really nthing like death note
<Dken2021> I'll somewhat agree with twilight_sprinkle, TTGL was interesting at first, but...wouldn't really watrch it twice
<LadyCanary> BIG O
<taoumi> yes ValtheJean you are correct. the movie did indead suck ass. season 2 is turning out ok though
<LadyCanary> ACTION
<Sumica> 00,10needs more dakka
<LadyCanary> Sumica \:3/
<ValtheJean> 2,14 remember the time Lelouche route a list, and then those people died?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: highly intelligent males with the power to make people do whatever he wants, including having people kill themselves or doing something to his will
<cowvarkian> needs more desu
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: yeah NO the dub has NOTHING on the sub. it's inferior to the HOTBLOODEDNESS of the sub. Also you saw the obligatory hot springs ep EVERY show has...that was the most fanservice it had really besides you always mentioning Yoko's bikini top for full mobility
<otakon> ValtheJean: two different shows mang
<ValtheJean> 2,14 also, there is no season 2 of Eureka 7
<otakon> ValtheJean: lol aren't they making one though?
<otakon> wait, Big O has 'Hit & Away'?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 they are, but its with different characters
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: see, youre already narrowing down from saying code geass is a death note ripoff to saying that lelouche and kira are the same, and even that isnt true
<otakon> seems odd for a Super Melee type to have H&A
<taoumi> yes there is ValtheJean wou lyou like a link?
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: im not a fan of purely hotblooded anime
<cachi01> ledouche........lol
<ValtheJean> 2,14 otakon, it's pilot ability
<Bronysith> GNIGHT everypony
<cachi01> im so funny
<cachi01> hehe
<Phase4> 00,02yeah actually, it should be fun
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> kk
<otakon> ValtheJean: oh so it's...
<cachi01> nnight Bronysith!
<Dken2021> seeya Bronysith
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Bronysith. :)
<Bronysith> otakon: i enjoyed the dub of gurren lagann TBH
<otakon> dat running Twi was so awesome looking
<taoumi> night Bronysith
<Ponies47> Eh. I don't mind
<otakon> night Bronysith sleep well mate
<Phase4> 00,02php, why you throw me more edge cases
<otakon> Bronysith: I found it lacking compared to the sub
<otakon> THE HELL?
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: their characters are completely different, kira was just a psycho with god-complex who lied to everyone and himself that he wanted to ehlp the worl, whereas lelouche genuinely wanted to help the world, and he was ready to sacrifice anything for it
<Ponies47> But really. I need to find other games to play besides TF2. I'm wasting my money on it ;_;
<taoumi> just for you ValtheJean http://anilinkz.com/series/eureka-seven-ao
<cachi01> O_O
<Phase4> 00,02to be fair, i'm doing something where you could actually justify the behaviour as 'this is what you get for doing weird stuff' but still
<otakon> the hell robot was that from?
<otakon> seriously is JUMPED on him and killed him
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no links during a stream
<taoumi> it's not a viedo link ValtheJean
<otakon> taoumi: have you read the rules mate?
<taoumi> IT'S NOT A VIEDO LINK
<otakon> taoumi: just go with the flow on this
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's not an image link

<otakon> HIT WITH A WRENCH!
<RAWRity> so, saw the Walking Dead premiere. Was okay.
<oGriofa> RAWRity: NEVERMIND THE :'(
<Ponies47> May 7 if I recall was when I joined
<otakon> okay buzzsaws work too
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: the comic books are still better
<Ponies47> 2012
<cachi01> oGriofa WHAT ANNOUNCEMENT
<RAWRity> cowvarkian: congratulations. I give not even a single fuck.
<RaveBrony> This was my first internet chat thingy. So i made sure to read the rules first thing :D
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: I couldnt give a fuck that you culdnt give a fuck
<twilight_sprinkle> well someone is in a bigger mood than usual
<cowvarkian> *couldnt
<Ponies47> It was for me to\
<RAWRity> *Couldn't
<otakon> RAWRity: you okay man?
<RAWRity> apostrophes are important
<Ponies47> It was only a temp ban but still
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: I know
<RaveBrony> Yeah :P
<otakon> damn
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: I just assume that people are smart enough to know what the fuck I'm trying to say
<RaveBrony> Ive been kicked quite a few times tho. None of them were for a legit reason tho :D
<otakon> Head Vulcan did that kind of damage?
*Ponies47 Will never forget when he got the ban hammer
<Ponies47> May 20, 2012
<ValtheJean> 2,14 fully upgraded*
<superretroworld> cmon guys no fighting
<otakon> oh nice
<RaveBrony> Dang :o
<cowvarkian> ValtheJean: he looks the same
<otakon> FINISH HIM OFF!
<cachi01> FIHGT FIGHT i meaan...
<RAWRity> otakon: fine. Just heard "The book is better" or "The comics are better" or "the short story is better" that it's become a meaningless phrase to me.
<Ponies47> How do I remeber?
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: cool story bro
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Ponies47> That was the same day I made the Ponies47 Youtube channel
<RAWRity> It adds nothing to the conversation other than saying that the speaker is familiar with some other form of the story.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Somehow, saying "the book was better than the movie" is pretty hipster.
<otakon> RAWRity: oh since it seems to be bandied around so much when comparing one adaptation to another?
<RaveBrony> Oh, lol
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: yes, the better version
<RAWRity> otakon: more or less, yes.
<cachi01> RAWRity cowvarkian u guys might want to use this image.. http://iambrony.steeph.tp-radio.de/mlp/gif/162402%20-%20animated%20fluttershy%20image_macro%20Look_At_All_The_Fucks_I_Give%20macro.gif
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: but were you going to say something else?
<otakon> or at least the original version of it
<Ponies47> I was son young and stupid when it happened
<cowvarkian> cachi01: LOOK AT THEM LOOK AT ALL OF THEM
<Ponies47> I was still pretty new to the chatting thing
<RaveBrony> Heh
<LadyCanary> RAWRity: ;___; W-What happened to DC nation....
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: hmm?
<RaveBrony> I remember when i first came here. No one noticed me at all :D
<RAWRity> I haven't seen Young Justice yet
<RaveBrony> I felt so left out
<LadyCanary> Neither have I
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: tis good
<RAWRity> had it DVR'd but mom's been hogging the TV all weekend.
<LadyCanary> But I heard something happened to DC Nation
<Ponies47> I didn't tell anyone I was new until later that night
<Sumica> 00,10buy ereything
<cachi01> LOL ==========> YOUNG JUSTICE <======= LOL
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: I just torrented young justice a few days ago, its pretty good
<cowvarkian> cachi01: what
<Ponies47> I remeber Scoots was the first mod to talk to me
<RaveBrony> I joined after an anime marathon thing was shown... im so mad that i missed it :D
<RAWRity> but anyway, the whole "The comic's better" thing is even more meaningless considering the Walking Dead tv show deviated from the comic storyline an entire season ago.
<RaveBrony> Sooo many of my fav movies shown that week
<Ponies47> It's a shame I can remeber stuff like this but stuff I need to remeber for tests on such ._.
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: yeah, I know
<Ponies47> :<
<cachi01> LOL =========> POINTLESS ARGUMENT <============ LOL
<oGriofa> I just lost all sense of reality..
<RaveBrony> Meh
<Ponies47> *but not
<RaveBrony> Thats life :I
<RaveBrony> remember the bad. Throw the stuff you need out the window :D
<oGriofa> I went to cheak out the other theaters, and they were all the same thing.. damn im a noob.
<cachi01> LOL ==========> REALITY <========== LOL
<Stormy> http://www.spyroforum.com/user-5492.html this new person was apparently born in 2004
<cowvarkian> the young justice tv show is actually more similar to the teen titans comic books, and the teen titans tv series is more similar to the young justice comic books...
<cowvarkian> just saiyan
<Stormy> that makes me feel really old ._.

<oGriofa> Woops comp crashed
<otakon> RAWRity: damn what? that sucks just when YJ was just getting good
<Stormy> someone born in 2004 is old enough to use the internet
<otakon> TWI IS MAD! THROW THE TWI!
<cowvarkian> otakon: I meant mostly the laughing part, and the fact that kids... bah whatever
<Spell-of-Gaming> I can't install Forge
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dang
<RAWRity> no official reason as to why, though some speculate that it's to make room for the retro programs that they're airing as part of the 20th anniversary
<otakon> dammit Boss FIGHT BACK!
<RaveBrony> Oh, and is that you on your DA, Ponies? With the 'watched mlp' caption on it?
<Cades> woah
<AJIsAwesome> I still need to get back into Young Justice. Ever since the hiatus I pretty much forgot about it.
<flutterchu> i saw this playthrough of a GREAT tutorial of how to play the legend of zelda blind
<flutterchu> LITERALLY BLIND
<RAWRity> however, the latest Young Justice episode's available for download through iTunes

<superretroworld> flutterchu: maybe they say that just for credit :D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes, running a stream can be a bit of a preoccupance
<otakon> since I know that Z deals with multiple dimensions and all...I think
<RaveBrony> The first picture on your DA
<cachi01> otakon watchu talkin bout willis?
<cowvarkian> ValtheJean: I see that
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but seriously, is it so bad that I tried to trust the chat?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 unfortunately, that

<Ponies47> No. That's Denis Leary :D

<LadyCanary> Blow up ALL THE MECHS
<oGriofa> night LadyCanary
<otakon> ValtheJean: at this point why not for simplicity just say no links whatsoever during a stream? It'd be easier to deal with it seems.
<cachi01> confound my non working tab
<Ponies47> Comedian, actor, he even wrote a book or 2
<otakon> night LadyCanary sleep well.
<dj-pon-3> i finnaly found the place where i can watch mlp movies :D
<superretroworld> flutterchu: maybe hes secretly looking on his left eye
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes it would, but image links are a tradition of ours
<The_Awesomeness> hello everypony
<Cades> lol I'm gonna get my mom to play portal. I wonder how bad she's gonna do :p
<cowvarkian> hey
<dj-pon-3> hello
<thelonepony> hi The_Awesomeness
<superretroworld> hello The_Awesomeness
<CrimsonPhoenix> Well pictures aren't as distracting
<The_Awesomeness> hows it going
<CrimsonPhoenix> youtube is a flat out insult
<The_Awesomeness> why
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, The_Awesomeness. :)
<dj-pon-3> thats not true
<CrimsonPhoenix> it shows how much you don't care for the streams and encourage other people to do so
<AJIsAwesome> Posting them publicly during a stream, it is.
<otakon> ValtheJean: yeah but for cripe's sake everytime someone posts a non image link that ISN'T a video you guys start waving your various ban weapons about.
<Stormy> haha, I got my mom to play New Super Mario Bros once
<The_Awesomeness> guys today i found a cat thats about 1 year old and looked like hed been lost for months
<Stormy> She didn't understand that you can't just run into the enemies
<RaveBrony> Ah, i see :o
<cowvarkian> otakon: I really only see val do it
<Stormy> it was pretty funny
<oGriofa> otakon: because their ban weapons are always freshley polished and shiny.
<CrimsonPhoenix> The_Awesomeness, are you going to adopt it?
<otakon> oGriofa: love that shiny trident
<ValtheJean> 2,14 we treat videos the same damn way otakon. If you've witnessed otherwise it's because I'm trying to manage a stream, 3 chats and many other things
<Ponies47> He's hilarious! :D
<The_Awesomeness> its kinda funny really we were driving by and this cat just crosses by us at a stopsign so i just get out and pick it up
<CrimsonPhoenix> that sounds very stressing
<Ponies47> I look nothing like him :P
<The_Awesomeness> its hair was all matted down and it was really thin
<CrimsonPhoenix> The_Awesomeness, are you going to adopt it?
<The_Awesomeness> i guess
<Kandarihu> 3 chats?
<otakon> ValtheJean: no no, don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's a bad thing just suggesting it would be easier to say no lings at all so you don't have to tell someone "no [link]" every time is all. I wasn't trying to be confrontational about it just saying.
<Sumica> 00,10I restart and things get intersting I see
<thelonepony> have you taken the cat the vet The_Awesomeness ?
<CrimsonPhoenix> indeed Sumica
<cowvarkian> Sumica: you could say that
<RAWRity> Sumica: boredom is a dangerous thing
<oGriofa> IS that bitching i hear? AGAIN?
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: I guess so.
<cowvarkian> oGriofa: where have you been
<otakon> Sumica: I'm suggesting that you guys just ban links altogether during streams for simplicities sake.
<The_Awesomeness> i would but its sunday
<cowvarkian> otakon: fuck that
<The_Awesomeness> so the vets closed
<oGriofa> cowvarkian: i just read the stuff.
<Sumica> 00,10many would like to do that
<otakon> Now I'm not saying I would
<cachi01> what is this dusk dawn fan episode??????????????
<superretroworld> The_Awesomeness: congrats to your new pet
<CrimsonPhoenix> otakon, may I add that people will STILL post link beside that
<thelonepony> The_Awesomeness: well try to get the cat to the vet tomorrow as soon as possible
<Ponies47> ded
<Cades> My mom was having trouble looking at the painting on the wall haha
<otakon> but it seems to be a problem and I think that would be the easiest way to solve the issue
<AJIsAwesome> cachi01: Fan made episode of a fanfic, I think.
<CrimsonPhoenix> flutterchu got told 100 times now about no video links
<cachi01> oh
<cowvarkian> CrimsonPhoenix: I've posted site links here, and only got told not to once...
<oGriofa> otakon: ban links?!
<otakon> cachi01: it's sadly a lacking full length fan ep... needs a lot of work.
<oGriofa> me/ kicks otakon
<cowvarkian> I posted the site links like, 5 times
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Agreed.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 thank you for admitting to breaking the rules cowvarikian
<cowvarkian> so... yeah
<The_Awesomeness> i cut the cats matted hair out and gave it small amounts of canned cat food frequently as intructed by the internet
<cachi01> oh hey gameloft is doing a MLP SIM
<otakon> ugh
<otakon> gameloft?
<otakon> ugh
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dask's dawn is an abomination
<cowvarkian> ValtheJean: I didn't know I was breaking the rules until you told me I was at one time
<ValtheJean> 2,14 rather than gloat about getting away with it, why not realize that sometimes things get missed
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dusk's Dawn**
<Spell-of-Gaming> SIM?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh god.
<cachi01> i mean
<cachi01> you are twilight sparkle
<Spell-of-Gaming> No, just no.
<Dark92Enigma> Twilight Sparkle just evolved
<The_Awesomeness> but i dont know if the cat will survive its pretty thin and might have a disease, plus it already has diarhea
<cachi01> and u build ur own ponyville
<Dark92Enigma> i'm back!
<oGriofa> Lets just let the link thing go guise.
<cowvarkian> oGriofa: I'm fine with this
<RaveBrony> Sorry, went on a DA clicking rampage :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> Someone will hack it for Rule 34.
<taoumi> see i'm w/ otakon here. it's rather confuseing what constatues a 'ok' link. becasuse some images have as much text a a normal site. so it gets rather grey
<cachi01> soooo lets just see how the game ends
<Spell-of-Gaming> I just know it
<Dark92Enigma> Done watching TNA Bound for Glory.....it was awesome
<CrimsonPhoenix> The_Awesomeness, check it with a veterinarian?
<cachi01> and apparently its coming to the app store SOON
<Ponies47> Ah
<cowvarkian> cachi01: everyone dies
<RaveBrony> Looking at all the lovely pony artwork i will never be able to do :FD
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh god
<RaveBrony> *:D
<cachi01> and everyone lies
<Spell-of-Gaming> Why
<Ponies47> XD
<RaveBrony> Im so jealous of JJ's work :'(
<RaveBrony> Talk about awesome artwork!
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Not an abomination, just a bad attempt. The VA was bad, the story seemed weak, plus various other things. Is it an unholy abomination that should burn eternally in a volcano? No, of course not. Does it need work? YES, and LOTS of it. I'd still give it a chance if they remade it or fixed a LOT of things.
<Ponies47> Ah
<The_Awesomeness> guys do you think society has progressed soically in any mahor way scince its begining other than science and technollogy
<Stormy> well to be fair first person games are pretty confusing
<Stormy> for me at least
<Stormy> :P
<cowvarkian> The_Awesomeness: yes
<AJIsAwesome> Otherwise, I don't hate it.
<The_Awesomeness> how
<cowvarkian> The_Awesomeness: arts?
<cowvarkian> The_Awesomeness: culture?
<The_Awesomeness> hows that improved
<Sumica> 00,10emo seed
<twilight_sprinkle> The_Awesomeness: good question
<thelonepony> Sumica: ikr
<AJIsAwesome> Also, welcome back, Dark92Enigma. :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, You're saying they should change the whole thing for you to like it.
<Ponies47> Dat EQD bot
<oGriofa> http://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350269202646.jpg
<cowvarkian> The_Awesomeness: are you seriously asking how much humanity has improved since we became humans?
<The_Awesomeness> anchents had culture and arts its not like its become something greater than it was back when engineers bult the pyrimids
<CrimsonPhoenix> I respect their ambition and patience on the project
<twilight_sprinkle> The_Awesomeness: since its creation id say yes, but relative to science in terms of importance and overall progress, id say no
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: i'll be here for a very short time.....because i'm just done watching a PPV
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: So do I. I'm just stating problems in the episode.
<cowvarkian> The_Awesomeness: we developed societies, we built cities, walls, and other fucking fantastic shit
<Sumica> 00,10only problem was CrimsonPhoenix, they said they rushed the project
<CrimsonPhoenix> but really it felt like they just wanted the title of the very first fan-made episode
<CrimsonPhoenix> and that
<CrimsonPhoenix> I cannot accept
<cowvarkian> The_Awesomeness: do you not count literature as well?
<The_Awesomeness> im talking about anything but science i mean culturally do you think humans have improved as peaople?
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: What ep----OH DOUBLE RAINBOOM? NO SPOILERS FOR ME, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!
<cowvarkian> The_Awesomeness: yes
<cowvarkian> I do
<The_Awesomeness> how
<Sumica> 00,10no Dark92Enigma
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dark92Enigma, Dusk's Dawn
<ValtheJean> 2,14 fanmade episodes are an abomination, and we shouldn't be embracing them so wholeheartedly as a community
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: The Dusk's Dawn episode.
<cowvarkian> ValtheJean: cool story
<The_Awesomeness> how have we improved
<CrimsonPhoenix> I'm skeptically looking forward to Double rainboom
<Sumica> 00,10ValtheJean, on the whole people are not
<Dark92Enigma> CrimsonPhoenix: Oh, Dusk Dawn and not MLP FIM
<oGriofa> ValtheJean: Why the heck not? Fan made stuff is awesome.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 then some faith in the fandom restored
<cowvarkian> The_Awesomeness: I honestly can't explain it, I just know we have
<twilight_sprinkle> The_Awesomeness: well its hard to say since we can only mopstly judge from our own lifespan, but id say no
<Yahooz> Its one thing to make a fan-made episode, its another to make one with OCs and a COMPLETELY revamped style and storyline
<Maid_RainBow> good morning everypony
<Eddmario> Did you know that a fanfic writer in the fandom recently got a novel published?
<twilight_sprinkle> The_Awesomeness: not much at least
<ValtheJean> 2,14 because it's an insult to the show's creators in exchange for self-service
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Maid_RainBow
<Sumica> 00,10especaly seeing as the "first" fan ep was rushed and it shows
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Maid_RainBow.
<thelonepony> Hi Maid_RainBow :)
<The_Awesomeness> anchent societies have acheived and surpassed our level of social equallity many times
<cachi01> pinkie pie is best 133t HAX0R
<CrimsonPhoenix> I wouldn't say it'll be the best thing ever but if Double Rainboom will be decent
<cachi01> https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/pinkiepie-strikes-again-compromises-google-chrome-pwnium-contest-hack-box-101012
<flutterchu> they said double rainboom was gonna be the first fan made episode........
<cachi01> flutterchu: WELL NOPE
<Sumica> 00,10heheh you bumpd the home button ValtheJean
<Lyra`> twilight!
<RAWRity> so, looking at "Dusk's Dawn" the first 10 seconds make me think that this was animated by old-school South Park animators.
<MakerDusk> we need more Dr. Who knock off episodes
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Giggity~
<Lyra`> you dont belong up there!
<Lyra`> WATCH OUT!
<cachi01> RAWRity: lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> I really cannot accept Dusk's Dawn as a whole. As what it is meant to be and what it wanted to do
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03So yeah, more pics coming tomorrow!
<Yahooz> Double Rainboom is going to seem like its not even made by fans
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,031So yeah, more pics coming tomorrow!
<Kandarihu> Dusk Dawn, is this a fanmade episode of FiM? Or something else?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Freaking computer..
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's not the first fan-made episode of MLP:FiM
<cachi01> it would be funny if double rainboom sucked
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Night y'all!
<cachi01> night Scoot-Scootaloo :)
<thelonepony> Night Scoot-Scootaloo :)
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Scoot-Scootaloo.
<The_Awesomeness> its not like we've made some revolutionary change to the human condition scince its begining. i mean sure we have all this technollogy but have we improved as a people have we changed?
<Sumica> 00,10best review of Dusk dawn that I have seen compared it to "the room"
<Lyra`> oh twilight, youre not a gundam :3
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: it's what happens when somebody takes 6 OC's and tries to make an episode of FiM
<Yahooz> cachi01: only i've seen the WIP at bronycon, and so far, its as if the fans had complete assistance from the animators, only they actually didnt
<Ponies47> Meow :3
<RAWRity> good lord
<cachi01> Yahooz: i mean the story
<RAWRity> There's pre-youtube Flash Animations made with better animation than this.
<Yahooz> cachi01: the trick to a good story is planning EVERY detail out beforehand. Im fully confident they did so
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Ponies47. :3
<Lyra`> why is eureka seven in here as well?
<RAWRity> "Ultimate Battle of Ultimate Destiny" moved more fluidly than this stilted pile of puke
<thelonepony> Hi Ponies47 :3
<Lyra`> i thought this was gundamn.
<Kandarihu> The_Awesomeness, we humans are fundamentally imperfect beings. The darkest ages in our modern era have happened when people have tried to deny that.
<Ponies47> Hi AJIsAwesome thelonepony :3
<Lyra`> i dont understand!
<Lyra`> ValtheJean! explain this!
<cowvarkian> >.>
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, seriously I really wish Dusk's Dawn didn't exist or at least did not claimed to be the first fan-made episode
<Lyra`> why is eureka 7 in this gundam game?
<Sumica> 00,10it's Super robot wars Lyra`
<Lyra`> oh.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: one would hope we would at least have gotten better, but that doesnt seem to be the case
<RAWRity> OH GOD NOW THEY'RE TALKING
<Lyra`> >.<
<Maid_RainBow> Caramel did you ever had one that got stuck on 1 HP?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Explain what? Then I'd have to explain why so many other animes are in it
<flutterchu> i guesse Double Rainboom will be "the first Fanmade episode not starred by OC's"
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: I can understand that.
<Sumica> 00,10it's mechs from many anime
<Lyra`> im never on why youre on babe'
<RAWRity> This is worse voice acting than spanish Fluttershy
<NullRadix> Here's kudos for the Dusk's Dawn team for getting out and doing something. The Level of Quality was clearly not up to snuff though. If that's because they specifically rushed it, then shame on them. If it's because they were learning, then hopefully they'll do better next time.
<Lyra`> *while
<cowvarkian> RAWRity: this is voice acting?
<Yahooz> NullRadix: Completely agree
<Ponies47|Shower> BRB shower
<AJIsAwesome> NullRadix: Agreed.
<NullRadix> Although I can see Val's point about it being insulting to the shows real animators
<CrimsonPhoenix> NullRadix, but again the fact that they claimed to be the first fanmade episode makes me sick
<NullRadix> but that goes for Fan episodes in general
<Lyra`> val can read mandarin?
<RAWRity> It's not so much insulting as it is kind of pitiable that they though this would hold up to snuff.
<Lyra`> that looks like a mix of japanese and chinese
<Lyra`> i dont even.
<NullRadix> CrimsonPhoenix: I suppose that's a point, it's not a FiM episode, it doesn't use FiM characters
<Yahooz> Like I said, its one thing to make a fan made episode, its another to make one with OCs and a revamped storyline and style, while keeping the concept constant
<RAWRity> Like, I'd watch Mysterious Mare-Do-Well on repeat for a week before watching this thing more than once.
<NullRadix> therefore it's just "in the style of FiM"
<CrimsonPhoenix> NullRadix, and yet they claimed to be first
<otakon> Lyra`: you do know that there are THREE Japanes alphabets right?
<Brad__> http://i.imgur.com/IC63D.jpg
<CrimsonPhoenix> while Double Rainboom project was announced far before that
<Lyra`> i dont
<panda2> Lyra`, i think he is just going with the flow.
<RAWRity> New Born Cuties had better animation than this.
<otakon> Seriously why fight a giant robot with another giant robot? JUST SEND IN THE OLD YAKUZA GANG!
<Yahooz> CrimsonPhoenix: they are the first to release a full version
<Lyra`> i dont think you can post that Brad__
<Lyra`> thast borderline bondage pony play
<Brad__> Lyra`, oops sorry.
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, we used to be better people. We've gotten worse over the past decade.
<Lyra`> AHHH! i see what yo did there XD
<otakon> Brad__: THAT is NSFW
<Yahooz> Double Rainboom may take another year or so before its done
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yahooz, a full version of what?
<Lyra`> pony play :3
<cachi01> Brad__: wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut .-.
<Brad__> otakon, is it?
<Lyra`> XD
<Yahooz> CrimsonPhoenix: of their work
<RAWRity> Kandarihu: what are you prattling on about now?
*Lyra` rofl
<otakon> Brad__: yeah would you post that at work? if no then it's NSFW.
<Lyra`> its fine
<CrimsonPhoenix> which can't be titled a fan-made episode
<Lyra`> he said sorry :3'
<Kandarihu> RAWRity, dangit. Suddenly I'm the agressor.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: that could be, although its hard to say how it was before without actually being there. but yeah, we certainly havent made any progress on that matter
<panda2> otakon, i think Sumica or SB posted that pic a couple weeks ago...
<Brad__> Different channels have different definition of NSFW, so I didn't know sorry.
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: okay, what are you both prattling on about now?
<Lyra`> well, i forgive you Brad__ :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: nah, hes always the agressor, dont worry about it
<Brad__> Lyra`, thx :P
<Sumica> 00,10I most certenly did not
<Lyra`> but i laughed XD
<Lyra`> pony play~
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, no. I'm always the aggressor.
<cachi01> Brad__: wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut .-.
<cachi01> Brad__: whyyyyyyyyyy .-.
<panda2> Oh... maybe it was SB who showed me xD
<otakon> Brad__: well next time if you're not sure if it's NSFW PM the link to a mod and ask if you can post it or not
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: Nu >:I
<Sumica> 00,10where I dont see any thing exactly wrong with that image it's certenly disterbing
<ValtheJean> 2,14 protip:
<Brad__> cachi01, I don't know! someone linked me on a different channel and I thought it was strange enough to warrant sharing
<otakon> panda2: yeah PMing you something and posting it in commons is different
<otakon> Sumica: agreed
<ValtheJean> 2,14 if you're having trouble deciding if it's NSFW, chances are it is
<Lyra`> protip: val weilds the ban hammer like he gets a quarter for every time he uses it :D
<Sumica> 00,10but seeing as you join and imeadatly post it I am sure you were just fishing for reactions and looking to start shit Brad__
<RAWRity> considering some of the awful cosplays I've posted on here, that thing's rather tame.
<otakon> Lyra`: no no, he has the ban TRIDENT remember?
<Lyra`> oh yeah
<Lyra`> dari has the ban hammer :3
<Brad__> Sumica, I wasn't trying to offend, just thought it was kind of WTF so thought others might get a kick out of it.
<RAWRity> otakon: well he did until I stole it.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 only towards you Lyra`, and that's only because you break rules as if someone promised you candy for it
<otakon> lol
<Kandarihu> We're so eager to claim the shame ROFL
<RAWRity> brb
<panda2> otakon it was in the chat >.>
*cachi01 hides the candy
<Lyra`> who told you about my candy deal?
<otakon> lol
<NullRadix> wait, we get candy for breaking rules?
<otakon> Lyra`: what? no muffins?
<Yahooz> Wrek give candybars for rule-breakers... they also come with a tase in the bum though
<Lyra`> oh yeah nullradix, so advertise #Bronystate in #bronystate all you like
*Spectrum_Rush -_(\
*panda2 gives Lyra` candy
<Brad__> I idle here all the time, its not like I just was looking for a pony channel to troll or something.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 or don't, since it's still spam
<Lyra`> okay ._.
<Yahooz> Its redundence
*Maid_RainBow give Lyra` also some candy
<Yahooz> not ALWAYS spam
<twilight_sprinkle> bronystate is spam
<Lyra`> ^-^
<Kandarihu> NullRadix, it's special candy that's designed to minimize flavor and maximize tooth decay.
<Lyra`> like air burst?
<NullRadix> so... it's Black Licorice?
<otakon> lol
<Yahooz> you know whats spam? toot
<Spell-of-Gaming> BronyState is /oat/, not /spam/
<Kandarihu> NullRadix, that's tasty.
<otakon> CRUSH HIM BOSS!
<NullRadix> no, red licorice is tasty
<NullRadix> black licorice is awful
<AJIsAwesome> Speaking of oats, I'm craving some oatmeal right now. :D
<Lyra`> i want some nature valley bars
<otakon> dammit I'm hungry
<otakon> Lyra`: oh I LOVE those, the honey granola are great
*RAWRity just ate a donut
<Lyra`> IKR!
<Yahooz> ur fyat
<Spell-of-Gaming> /me hides his chocolate oatmeal
<Lyra`> and i'll even give one to ValtheJean
<otakon> Renton, seriously it's not incredible EVERY TIME YOU DODGE
<Spell-of-Gaming> Derp
<Spell-of-Gaming> Fail.
<Lyra`> he can roast it on his ban trident
<otakon> you're in a Real Type, they're MADE to be dodgey
<AJIsAwesome> MmmmmmmmmmmmmmmBombs
<cachi01> otakon: honey granola are my fave bars!
<Kandarihu> Judging from these bad guys, I'm guessing Val's going through a mission based on one of the older series.
<otakon> welp that looked painful
<RAWRity> what do you expect, it's Renton
<otakon> Kandarihu: I think so
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yes, they're enemies from Mazinger
<otakon> RAWRity: true, he's as easy to impress as dangling keys in front of a baby
<ValtheJean> 2,14 with some dimensional beasts thrown in
<Lyra`> mine is the drill that will pierce the heavens! WHO DO YOU THINK I AM?!?
<Yahooz> your Lyra`
<Kandarihu> Oh, okay.
<Yahooz> now sit down
<cachi01> Lyra`: obama?

<otakon> Lyra`: me too
<otakon> eeyup DEAD
<Lyra`> ^-^
<otakon> He just caught a bad case of explosions
<Kandarihu> And it doesn't matter that Mazinger Z originally aired 3 years before I was born.

<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: Me too :D
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: Shizu stream :)
<VenHur> I remember those...I had nightmares for life the first time I sawed those things...
<Canadian_Brony> FUCK YEH!!
<AJIsAwesome> SMB Movie would be a B movie right? :D
<doctor_whooves127> dialga=t.a. giritina=r.d. palkia=i.s.
<Dark92Enigma> A little TRIVIA: ''CLOVERFIELD'' was originally supossed to be the codename for the movie, but instead, it turned out to be the ACTUAL TITLE! <------
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: yeah
<Sumica> 00,10this movie got my 7 bucks because they made it seem intersting. I was disapointed
<flutterchu> what movie?
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<Eddmario> Why the FUCK is it even called Cloverfield anyway?
<Everlasting_Joy> "It's me, the UPS guy. I'm here to deliver you a package."
<twilight_sprinkle> 6.47 am, if that were me trying to slap, id already have shoved that camera up his-
<superretroworld> surprisenly, i liked the mario brothers movie
<Shizuka> 13Eddmario: clover is one of the first plants to come back after a nuclear blast
<cowvarkian> Everlasting_Joy: a penis?
<Kandarihu> The SMB Movie would be worth riffing
<otakon> Eddmario: something to do with the you-know-what
<Ponies47> I needs sleep? I got Rifftrax :P
<twilight_sprinkle> *trying to sleep
<Ponies47> *Who
<Cypresswolf> I hear the original title to this movie was Rampage (the movie of the NES game)
<Canadian_Brony> So, what is this movie about?
*Dark92Enigma this moment has been brought to you by UPS
<Everlasting_Joy> cowvarkian: I said a package, not a penis ;).
<Shizuka> 13the end of the movie involves nuking central park, thus the codename (and the note at the start saying formerly known as central park)
<PeachStreak|Base> who does how can i make that robotic voice
<Kurra> oh this is Cloverfield movie?
<Eddmario> Canadian_Brony: I actually have no idea, and I've seen it before!
<Dark92Enigma> Eddmario: Movie writing....
<Kurra> i've seen this movie before.
<Sumica> 00,10more transformers rips
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: this movie has writing?
<ntfwc> ok the stream is moving smoothly now :)
<sub06905|TARDIS> this movie any good?
<Dark92Enigma> cowvarkian: poor one
<Kurra> Can someone who knows what the ....aww nevamind]
<Cypresswolf> Still waiting for a sequal to this - or at least more monster movies like this
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: huh ok
<AJIsAwesome> Same here, didn't hate it but was disappointed.
<Shizuka> 13sub06905|TARDIS: not really, thus the riff
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka so, this is supposed to be a home video of what happens when New York gets nuked in WWIII?
<Everlasting_Joy> What's up with those lines that are higher pitched? Is one of the riffters or was that an effect?
<otakon> Cypresswolf: Monster
<Eddmario> sub06905|TARDIS: The non-riftrax version is terrible
<sub06905|TARDIS> then i shall enjoy the rifftrax :$
<cowvarkian> Canadian_Brony: actually, because of an alien, godzilla thing
<Canadian_Brony> . . .
<Shizuka> 13Canadian_Brony: no no see a satellite owned by a japanese company somehow crashes into the ocean and wakes up a baby giant monster that starts bumbling around new york
<MirrorImage> Everlasting_Joy - it's a sound sync
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: Not bad or good it's ok
<otakon> Everlasting_Joy: that's Disembodio, the tracer line that makes sure the riffs are in sync
<Cypresswolf> Monster! what did I type?
<Shizuka> 13even though NONE OF THAT is explained in the film
<MirrorImage> those pitches are in the rifftrax so you know that it's lined up
<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Exactly.
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: it's like an a-bomb of adequacy
<superretroworld> Shizuka: wtf kind of story is that?
<Shizuka> 13hud here was obviously cast to be ugly because he'll be behind the screen for the rest of the film
<Everlasting_Joy> MirrorImage and otakon: O.K.
<Kurra> for real Shizuka?? Goodness 8C
<therainbowvortex> hey every pony
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka that is the stupid bullsh*t idea I've heard in a long time. And I know stupid shit; I'm in high school.
<superretroworld> hey therainbowvortex
<Canadian_Brony> *stupidest
<Shizuka> 13yeah ded srs btw
<VenHur> Shizuka: ...It's always to be blamed on Japan, isn't it?
<thelonepony> hai therainbowvortex :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey therainbowvortex
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, therainbowvortex. :)
<ntfwc> oh dam, no-one shakes the camera that much
<Shizuka> 13afaik there's a sequel in development hell
<Eddmario> The 2000 Godzilla movie was better then this POS
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy therainbowvortex.
<Shizuka> 13that would involve the clover monster's mom or something
<Eddmario> Shizuka: How the FUCK can they even do that?
<Sumica> 00,10the first of many motion sick pukes
<VenHur> I mean, we see a TONS of "Made In Japan" product, why the hell not?
<Dark92Enigma> cowvarkian: I REMEMBER the Mario Brothers Movie......the most i can remember is that it took FOREVER to get to the action
<cowvarkian> Dark92Enigma: that'd be fun to riff over
<Shizuka> 13but yeah the core of it is the monster's supposed to be a baby looking for its mom, because that totally makes sense from the film's point of view
<ntfwc> it's like they shook it on purpose
*superretroworld wonders why he loved the mario bros movie
<Shizuka> 13and it revolves around japan because godzilla
<Eddmario> Shizuka: It's a BABY!?!? It's the end of Boast Busters all over again...
<Shizuka> 13ah there she is the only likable character in the whole movie
<Sumica> 00,10this movie could have been twice as good if they just invested in a steady cam
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka I wasn't saying I didn't believe you, if you saw it as that.
<Shizuka> 13look at it this way sumi, this isn't an 80 foot screen :3
<VenHur> I think the baby must be Godzuki...y'know...from the cartoon? ...Watch it peoples.
<Eddmario> Sumica: An uncensored lesbian sex scene couldn't save this movie...
<pony_666> what are yall watching?
<ASoftFluffyThing> 'Lo SaxyPretender
<Cypresswolf> The sequal involving the monster's mom? That was a BABY monster?
<ntfwc> even if they just stuck it on someone's head it would be relatively steady
<cowvarkian> Eddmario: It'd make it better
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh hai everyone
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, SaxyPretender. :)
<Sumica> 00,10I did't say save it
<cowvarkian> SaxyPretender: hey
<Ponies47> Hey SaxyPretender!
<Sumica> 00,10I said twice as good
<thelonepony> ohau SaxyPretender :)
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy SaxyPretender!
<superretroworld> hello SaxyPretender
<sub06905|TARDIS> ohai SaxyPretender
<Canadian_Brony> pony_666 a Rifftrax of a movie with a stupid plotline
<Canadian_Brony> hi SaxyPretender
<Shizuka> 13Cypresswolf: i think the only way they could possibly save a sequel would be to make the clover monster's mom actually be cthulhu
<cowvarkian> Canadian_Brony: this has a plotline?
<Eddmario> cowvarkian: You're thinking of the 2000 Godzilla movie. NOTHING could save this movie...
<Canadian_Brony> cowvarkian I dunno
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so we're watching one of my favorite movies?
<pony_666> soo someone comentating cloverfield?
<ntfwc> why is the camera being held non-level
<SaxyPretender> 0,14SWEET
<sub06905|TARDIS> dat extra
<Sumica> 00,10we should watch skyline next
<ASoftFluffyThing> Shizuka, but isn't Cthulhu a male?
<cowvarkian> Sumica: that was a shitty movie
<Shizuka> 13i didn't say it was a *good* plan
<Sumica> 00,10yeah it would go great with this
<Eddmario> SaxyPretender: Can't tell if troll or [banned from BronyState for bashing a mod]
<Cypresswolf> I'd watch the HELL out of that movie if Cthulhu was the monster
<Canadian_Brony> Oh hey, does anypony here who plays Borderlands 2 tried out the Mechromancer?
<Shizuka> 13if i had another scary rifftrax i'd queue it but sb is up after me and it'll be like 2am by then
<cowvarkian> Sumica: I wonder if Shizuka has a rifftrax for that
<Canadian_Brony> *has
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Not trolling, I actually do like the movie
<sub06905|TARDIS> inb4 shit movies marathon on bronystate
<pony_666> i have its op Canadian_Brony
<Dark92Enigma> superretroworld: maybe you liked it for how creative it was for TRYING to adapt the videogame to the big screen, even though they don't look like the originals? yeah....you can't stomp on a turtle in real life, gotta give that movie credit
<Shizuka> 13i have sixth sense though, if that counts as a scary movie
*ASoftFluffyThing thinks that Cthulhu is male, though she'd be fine with a Cthulhu mother
<cowvarkian> sub06905|TARDIS: thats already happened
<sub06905|TARDIS> cowvarkian: it did
<Dark92Enigma> A
<Dark92Enigma> s
<sub06905|TARDIS> :o
<Cypresswolf> Hug?
<Sumica> 00,10I am Heads up Display
<cowvarkian> brb
<cowvarkian> maybe
<cowvarkian> yeah
<Eddmario> Shizuka: E-mail SB the rifftrax and have him steam it then. Or you could switch to a rifftrax of a movie that's actually savable...
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: oh, WHEN you'll show the Sixth Sense?
<Canadian_Brony> pony_666 very op, but I'm not talking about that. I gave her the skin "Reddy Steddy Go" and renamed her "Pinkie Pie"
<ASoftFluffyThing> I'M HIDING MY HORRIBLE ACTING BY SHAKING THIS CAMERA AND TRYING TO LOOK COL!
<ASoftFluffyThing> cool*
<ntfwc> lol
<VenHur> Shizuka got I See Dead Peoples: The Motion Picture? SWEET!
<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: it was pretty creative, but i think i liked it for the story
<Sumica> 00,10Supprise you walked in to a crapy movie
<Everlasting_Joy> It's S2E14 all over again.

<oGriofa> i love this movie
<DARK> wat is this???
<SaxyPretender> 0,14this is part of the reason I liked how that borough got wrecked
<Sumica> 00,10main dude
<Eddmario> DARK: A rifftrax of Cloverfield, AKA the WORST movie in existance
<Dark92Enigma> You know, this movie reminded me of Blair Witch, camera and all
<cowvarkian> SaxyPretender: you're welcome
<otakon> I hear Gorillaz
<doctor_whooves127> so wait guy headed to japan gets attacked by giant monster talk about ironic
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, dat Gorillaz
<Shizuka> 13Eddmario: nah that's anything produced by the epic movie guys
<Sumica> 00,10and the entire budget of this film when to this 30 second loop of gorlliza
<Dark92Enigma> O Hai DARK!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<Eddmario> The ONLY good part about this movie is the music
<Canadian_Brony> SaxyPretender remind me never to go to NY then, I deal with enough crazy people up here.
<Eddmario> Shizuka: No, this is worse
<J_E_Smith71> Eddmario: Well I don't know if they'd do Evil Dead 1 since we saw it within the last six months
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: Thank you for bringing that nightmare up again.
<cowvarkian> Sumica: basicly
<Shizuka> 13sorry .-.
<Shizuka> 13um ponies?
<Dark92Enigma> superretroworld: And you gotta understand how angry they were
<Shizuka> 13just lie back and think of ponies
<Dark92Enigma> GORILLAZ! F*** YEAH!
<Eddmario> J_E_Smith71: I don't mind, as I actually haven't seen the second or third movie
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: >.>
<Eddmario> *movies
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: Actually, that worked :).
<Dark92Enigma> Eddmario: i agree with Shizuka there
<Sumica> 00,10even the camera is drunk
<sub06905|TARDIS> epic movie with ponies?
<therainbowvortex> hey guys i cant help but think ive missed somthing
<Shizuka> 13i'll give them credit for the editing in this film since it's not one continuous shot by any stretch
<SaxyPretender> 0,14we passed by the chick passed out on the couch right?
<superretroworld> Dark92Enigma: oh yes
<AJIsAwesome> In this segment the Buddha isdrunk
<Eddmario> Well, I'm outta here before this movie makes me forget what I did last week
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: OH WAIT WHA--- NO....THE NIGHTMARES AGAIN!
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica the camera's always drunk
<ASoftFluffyThing> SaxyPretender, yep
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: jk
<Everlasting_Joy> What the?! Did the camera have a seizure
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Eddma- gone.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that chick is a big figure in the ARG that led up to the movie
<cowvarkian> SaxyPretender: the arg?
<Shizuka> 13in that segment the buddha is holding a camera in one hand and a PBR in the other
<Shizuka> 13cowvarkian: 90% of the film's story was done in an alternate reality game before the movie's release
<Sumica> 00,10can we just nuke them now?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Alternative-
<Shizuka> 13that's why the movie itself sucks so bad
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: ok then
<ASoftFluffyThing> In time, Sumica. In time.
<Shizuka> 13sorry saxy.. years of typing practice .-.
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica *sigh* we all wish
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: No, we have to make you hate them more.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's coo' XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> I just finished reasing Bridge in Background Pony from shortskirtandexplosion....
<Sumica> 00,10Everlasting_Joy, that is not posable
<DARK> why this movie??
<Sumica> 00,10that would be like haveing too much dakka
<SaxyPretender> 0,14actually, to get the FULL story, you need the Blu-Ray
<Canadian_Brony> DARK because Rifftrax
<AJIsAwesome> Because Rifftrax.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and people say MLD is the most tearing piece of litterature of the fanbase
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ARG has such a little payoff in the movie
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: That ninja. :P
<Shizuka> 13DARK: cause let's face it, no one was voting for this movie anytime soon
<Sumica> 00,10this movie is why I did't go see super 8
<DARK> lol ^
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Super 8 was alright
<Spectrum_Rush> In that segment the buddha just ninja'd someone for the millionth time
<Everlasting_Joy> Sumica: :)
<DerpyMuffins> Super 8 wasnt that bad
<CrimsonPhoenix> anyway late now and I have work tomorrow
<Shizuka> 13i heard super 8 was relatively okay, might have to look into it sometime
<cowvarkian> Sumica: super 8 was.. yeah alright
<SaxyPretender> 0,14not shakycam, at least
<AJIsAwesome> BYe, CrimsonPhoenix. :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> good bye everyone
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: and i see why
<DARK> it was
<ntfwc> well that's good
<Shizuka> 13the trailer of sorts in portal 2 was... odd
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome that's impossible, I'm playing as Mechromancer, not Zero
<Sumica> 00,10the only think intersting about super8 was the interactive trailer
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Super 8 was essentially, "What if JJ Abrams made a Spielberg movie?"
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: I'm gonna check Super 8 sometime too-----
<Everlasting_Joy> "They're sleeping together." What a shock. . . :|
<Shizuka> 13oh marlena, if only you didn't get a bridge dropped on you
<Sumica> 00,10useing sourse
<RAWRity> so, anybody here seen The Cabin in the Woods?

<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome so then you heard what I renamed her?
<Cypresswolf> Tell EVERYBODY!
<Sumica> 00,10they do have super8 on netflix i might give it a shot
<Shizuka> 13hey hey
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Yep. Nice.
<superretroworld> CrimsonPhoenix: a fanfic?
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: hey
<Shizuka> 13ready overanalysis?
<CrimsonPhoenix> yes
<Dark92Enigma> oOGriofa Oh ....SNAP?
<ntfwc> I haven't been following the plot, but I don't think I'd learn anything useful anyways XD
<Everlasting_Joy> I love how the camera is trying to get boob shots in. . . Really poor taste.
<Shizuka> 13so this is supposed to be the DOD replaying this tape right
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dudemanmandudedudemandude
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yep, Shizuka
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: yesh

<Sumica> 00,10I love that song
<Shizuka> 13wouldn't they crop it?
<VenHur> What I missed?
<sub06905|TARDIS> juggle cats
<Shizuka> 13i mean really, the DOD doesn't care about these kids any more than we do
<cowvarkian> Shizuka: they should've
<cowvarkian> cropped it
<CriticKitten> Need to sleep, Shizu starts streaming. Ffffffffff. ;_;
<Sumica> 00,10this is the first screaning of it Shizuka
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: no wonder why he never showed his face
<ASoftFluffyThing> CriticKitten, Sleep is for the weak
<Everlasting_Joy> Shizuka: Can we then call the DOD heros?
<Shizuka> 13explosions will arrive in a few moments ponies
<ntfwc> yay explosions
<ntfwc> and death
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: and the Nostalgia Critic references
<RAWRity> Shizuka: eh, just don't bother thinking about the gimmic. It'll cause nothig but headaches, adn there's enough headaches in this film.
<Cypresswolf> perhaps leaving the boring stuff in was a defense tactic - oh this is just a family video - nothing classified here
<Ponies47> O.O
<cowvarkian> studied rhetoric under shaggy...
<otakon> finally
<otakon> goddamn finally
<Canadian_Brony> oh look, a blackout. PANIC!!!

<pony_2978> It is in every hollywood movie
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So where the hell did the monster right now?
<Sumica> 00,10why the dutch angle

<Kimori> Cynder7 :D
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Yep she dies next
<Geoff_Parker> mwhahahaahhah
<Silver_Soother> Sumica: Well;Dutch angle is supposed to make the viewer uncomfortable, to give a sense of dread. BUt, I dunno why they used it here, the whole movie is pretty dreadful...
<SpadeMagnes[R]> I knew it
<Kimori> I'm really idly just so you know
<pony_2978> This is a J.J. Abrams production, SpadesMagnes[R] - of course there are Lensflares
<Sumica> 00,10this was the point of the movie where I had to stop watching
<Kimori> But some of us are still alive here :P
<Sumica> 00,10was too sick
<VenHur> Be right back, bathroom break for me.
<pony_666> imabout to esplode

<pony_2978> "Give me all the eggs and bacon you have."
<Dark92Enigma> It's a shame when you see that the MONSTER IS THE BEST ACTOR IN THIS MOVIE......:(
<Geoff_Parker> i rember i was here and was watching family matters and fresh prince
<pony_666> :(
<Sumica> 00,10move move move
<Cynder7> 6xD That's good ^^
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: no....GREEN EGGS AND HAM!
<Shizuka> 13boomer
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Cant there be one movie where the millitary stands a chance against a alien force?
<Geoff_Parker> who was here watching fresh prince and family matters?
<DARK46> send in my little guns
<Canadian_Brony> Sumica . . . not sure which that falls under, but I don't blame you. I'd have a migraine if I didn't have something else to look at
<Geoff_Parker> :L
<Dark92Enigma> WHAT ABOUT BOOMER, Shizuka !?
<superretroworld> SpadeMagnes[R]: just like the guards in mlp
<Everlasting_Joy> SpadeMagnes[R]: What about ID4?
<Geoff_Parker> :T
<Shizuka> 13you're about to see

<AJIsAwesome> Dark92Enigma: Oh I, frquently think every know and then, of the glorious food of the noble hen~
<Sylandest> Total boomer inc
<Geoff_Parker> >:-)
<pony_666> out comes the xenomorphs
<otakon> yeah not what you think there
<SaxyPretender> 0,14So, the monster (and therefore the ticks) feed on some sort of "sea nectar", and when they bite you, you get a whole bunch of it in your blood. It doesn't react well with humans on such a massive scale.
<Canadian_Brony> wait, chest burster?
<pony_2978> "I am freaked out and scared of my crush, but I will still dutifully keep recording."
<AJIsAwesome> .................
<Shizuka> 13cause... that makes sense...
<Canadian_Brony> Now this is ripping of Alien?
<Geoff_Parker> what does this mean, i am trying to figure it out,FTW
<Canadian_Brony> It's bad enough by itself!
<Geoff_Parker> what is ftw
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: makes as much sense as Vampire Venom in Twilight
<otakon> SaxyPretender: actually it was theorized that they cause local welts to get TO the blood on the creature.
<Sumica> 00,10she just inflated till she popped
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Am I wrogn to say I dont get anything about this plot?
<Shizuka> 13so, the only likable character is dead, half an hour to go
<Everlasting_Joy> They're ripping off "Alien". Wow.
<Dark92Enigma> IT'S.........AN ALIEN RIPOFF!!!!
<Geoff_Parker> i don't go on chat's that often
<otakon> SaxyPretender: sadly on humans it causes the blood pressure to build into you explode
<pony_2978> Shizuka: Who was the likable character in this movie?
<otakon> IT IS NOT
<ntfwc> so she was killed by...inflation?
<Shizuka> 13the one that just blew up
<Dark92Enigma> Shizuka: i can do this!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nope, it's the sea necter
<Canadian_Brony> Dark92Enigma I just said that..
<pony_666> its godzila with facehuggers
<otakon> ntfwc: blood pressure actually
<SaxyPretender> 0,14blu-ray commentary confirms it
<pony_2978> Shizuka: She was likeable?
<Canadian_Brony> SaxyPretender but the real question is: WTF is sea nectar?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> go go go\
<pony_2978> These are all asshole yuppies
<Sumica> 00,10yeah she expanded and popped
<Everlasting_Joy> I am going to hit the hay folks. Good night!

<SpadeMagnes[R]> :P
<[Name_Invalid]> hi
<Dark92Enigma> WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE THE MONSTER AGAIN!
<RAWRity> Shizuka: also, it doesn't NEED to be explained. We can surmise from the dialogue that something caused by the spider-thing bites leads to exploding. That's all we need given the POV
<Shizuka> 13SaxyPretender: given how he like immediately zooms in when she enters the party, i think hud's had a crush on her for a while before
<Canadian_Brony> hi [Name_Invalid]

<Canadian_Brony> It's creative!!
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Right...because when a monster is rampaging, WE WANT TO GO UP
<SpadeMagnes[R]> WHY
<SpadeMagnes[R]> JUST WHY
<pony_2978> The ending of this movie is the stupidest part. When the stupid helicopter operator didn't just fly in the opposite direction
<ntfwc> why are they going into a building?
<RAWRity> ...oh my god
<Canadian_Brony> Eddmario yes. The only likeable character

<Canadian_Brony> Sumica yes. They are that stupid
<RAWRity> basically, a group of people called the Donner Party were heading west to stake their claim in the unclaimed lands of the US. They left late in the year and with minimal supplies, and eventually had to resort to eating one another to keep from all starving to death.
<Shizuka> 13now, if i had enough brain cells removed that i was designated camera pony for this disaster

<Canadian_Brony> His name is Robert Hawkens
<otakon> Okay hold on
<DARK467> yup
<ASoftFluffyThing> His name is Robert Hawkins
<Dark92Enigma> OH MY GOD HE SPAT ME ONTO THE ISLAND FROM LOST! LOCKE, LOCKE, DID YOU SEE THE GIANT MONSTER? HE WAS SO CREEPY! HEY, IS THAT GUY FROM LORD OF THE RINGS REALLY DEAD? I LIKED THAT GUY! HE WAS COOOOL!
<otakon> HOW did this tape SURVIVE a nuke?
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: waIL
<Shizuka> 13magic
<VenHur> His name is Robert Hawkins...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14who said it was a nuke?
<Shizuka> 13actually
<Canadian_Brony> JAYSON!
<otakon> SaxyPretender: everyone does
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's like a MOAB
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: WAIT.....i saw it
<VenHur> I hope Steve Hawkins is watching this.
<Shizuka> 13otakon: plot armor, it's kept the camera safe so far
<AdamTheDuck> Good afternoon BronyState :)
<AJIsAwesome> His name is Rober Hawkins...
<otakon> Shizuka: the ONLY character to survive
<MegADooms> 3
<ntfwc> MOAB?
<MegADooms> 2
<ASoftFluffyThing> otakon, it was made of the same material that indestructible Nokia phone was
<SaxyPretender> 0,14actually, they did say it was a MOAB
<Dark92Enigma> AJIsAwesome: nostalgia critic reference in 3...2...1....
<MegADooms> 1
<Shizuka> 13SaxyPretender: the title cloverfield, meant to be a codename for a nuked zone, since clovers are the first thing to grow back
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So is the monster just on a baby temper tantrum?
<thelonepony> Hi AdamTheDuck :)
<otakon> SaxyPretender: so yeah nuke
<taoumi> gota get dat moab
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that was the popular theory
<SaxyPretender> 0,14buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
<Shizuka> 13though
<otakon> and nuked
<Dark92Enigma> .BULLSHIT! ALL THAT BUILD UP, ALL THIS TIME, ALL OF THAT JUST FOR A FUCKING MONSTER? SUCK MY DICK! IF I WANNA SEE MONSTERS I GO TO THE DMV TO GET MY LICENSE RENEWED!
<Shizuka> 13yeah that's not a nuke
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the only reason it's called that
<RAWRity> man, that sure was a powerful Nuke
<Shizuka> 13aaand there's the satellite that kicks off the movie
<AJIsAwesome> Testing.
<otakon> and that is where it ends
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So wai what did he tape over?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14is because there was a street called Cloverfield outside of thr studio
<Petrified_Discord> Everybody get ready to NOT see the ufo even if you're looking for it.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14JJ Abhrams liked the name
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's literally it
<Canadian_Brony> where is this, Disneyland?
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Good news the pony survived
<Canadian_Brony> oh, Coney Island
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: well, that's Abrhams for you
<ntfwc> and that was the end?
<Eddmario> Guess what? It's the best part of the movie: THE ENDING!
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: full of shit
<AJIsAwesome> Testing.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so the bomb is not a nuke, it's a Fuel-Air Ordinance Bomb
<SpadeMagnes[R]> it found its way to equestria before the nuke
<Canadian_Brony> ntfwc eeyup
<otakon> yeah that's it
<otakon> ugh
<SpadeMagnes[R]> So what im getting is...the monster was a baby...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also
<VenHur> That was it...?
<XylemTube> I think i love this stream, and everybody here
<ntfwc> wow, that was dissapointing
<otakon> Let's watch Super 8 next time shall we?
<VenHur> THAT was it?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14depends on who's being asked
<Shizuka> 13and yeah
<Shizuka> 13that was it
<Sumica> 00,10droping a moab is also BS
<Silver_Soother> XylemTube: I'm loved?! <3
<AdamTheDuck> So I just missed out on a movie? ;~;
<otakon> Shizuka: fast forward creds?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Monster is either dead
<SaxyPretender> 0,14or....
<otakon> AdamTheDuck: you didn't miss much
<Canadian_Brony> that was a disapointing ending
<Sumica> 00,10they are so big they cant be droped normaly
<Shizuka> 13nah people say the credits music is good
<SpadeMagnes[R]> And was it just on a temper tantrum or something?
<Petrified_Discord> AdamTheDuck: "Missed out" is kinda subjective
<AJIsAwesome> That was it? :S
<otakon> SaxyPretender: I doubt it's dead
<SaxyPretender> 0,14still alive
<Shizuka> 13i haven't sat through it though
<VenHur> ...What happens? Did they both died? Did they lived?! EXPLAIN TO ME, MOVIE!
<DARK467> so thats it
<otakon> SpadeMagnes[R]: it got woke up from under the ocean, it's a baby
<Shammy> good night everypony~ Shammy is off to sleep
<Dark92Enigma> THIS. FILM. WAS. OKAY. Just...okay. Not good, not bad, it's just...okay. How's the monster? It's okay. How's the acting? It's okay. How are the special effects? IT'S ALL OKAY! It's like a giant, flaming, nuclear ball of adequacy! So if you like shaky cameras and monsters going "WAAH!" chances are you're gonna like Cloverfield. 5/10
<otakon> VenHur: got blown up by the military
<Silver_Soother> VenHur: All you need to know is... Boomer will live.
<AJIsAwesome> Night, Shammy. :)
<ASoftFluffyThing> Night, Shammy
<thelonepony> Night Shammy :)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14btw, would people be okay, if I cleared up plot details with a +m?
<Invi> nighty Shammy
<flutterchu> surprises........not much digital camera last an hour and 13 minutes
<Dark_Horst> Sumica: i thought they fit a b2 bomb shaft?
<otakon> SaxyPretender: go ahead
<Shizuka> 13go for it :3
<killerpony7733> Shammy Night~
<Sumica> 00,10they then packed the remans of the monster in a train car and called it super 8
<DARK467> whos streaming

<Canadian_Brony> SaxyPretender more than happy
<Petrified_Discord> HOLY SHIT/10
<VenHur> ...Oh well, maybe we'll find out...never...
<Dark92Enigma> VenHur: everyone died except for BOOMER and the PONY
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Shammy
<Shizuka> 13super 8 was an actual alien from what i recall from reviews
<Cynder7> 6Gtg..see you guys!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14alright guys
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so, a few key things
<Sumica> 00,10nope Dark_Horst, MOAB has to be droped from a C17
<Cades> cya
<Shizuka> 13i mean it's an alien not a monster woken up
<SaxyPretender> 0,14THAT is not the only monster
<Kimori> awww
<Kimori> just missed :/
<SaxyPretender> 0,14there are many more, and one attacked Japan
<Cades> :(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's an underwater creature and a baby looking for mommy as Shizuka said
<Shizuka> 13anyone hearing godzilla theme tribute here
<Sumica> 00,10they had to tribute somthing
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it feeds off of "sea nectar" (that they put into soft drinks)
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the ticks eat that too
<Shizuka> 13it takes this many people to make a movie suck this bad
<SaxyPretender> 0,14so raw sea necter + blood = BOOMER
<Shizuka> 13cause that makes sense..
<Sumica> 00,10all I am hearing is bullshit bullshit retcon retcon
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh yeah, the satellite at the end clonked the monster and woke it up, i think
<SaxyPretender> 0,14aand the kicker?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Hud gets a posthumous medal
<SaxyPretender> 0,14highest one a civilian can get
<Shizuka> 13how exactly did the satellite fall intact enough to wake a monster presumably way down in the ocean without making a bigger wave
<SaxyPretender> 0,14oh no wait
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it was awake before that
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02so many colors
<Shizuka> 13suddenly sb
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it attacked a off shore oil rig
<Shizuka> 13thought it was the mom that did that
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02What's the +m for? o.o
<SaxyPretender> 0,14did they ever confirm that?
<Shizuka> 13is what i read anyway
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Oh, I'm clearing up the plot for Cloverfield
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but yeah
<Shizuka> 13mom attacks oil rig, baby is woken by satellite
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Okay, then after you I have an important announcement to make.
<Shizuka> 13uh oh
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, monster can be controlled by people :3
<Shizuka> 13wait what
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and the ticks too :3

<SaxyPretender> 0,14liscened by JJ
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I do believe it's in canon
<Shizuka> 13see kids, if you're going to make a movie, put plot details IN THE GODDAMN MOVIE
<SaxyPretender> 0,14which means humanity is FUCKED if its siblings wake up
<SaxyPretender> 0,14okay, I'm done
<Shizuka> 13in summary, japan

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Alright, time for my announcement

<ASoftFluffyThing> SaxyPretender but how do humans control it?
<VenHur> HAH, SEE WHAT I DID THERE?! I MADE A PUN!
<Silver_Soother> Why are you going to Illinois Shizuka ?
<Buytoast> at least there isn't a colverfield fanclub they're thanking
<ntfwc> The credits are better than the movie! XD
<pony_666> 8)
<Shizuka> 13RAWRity: central illinois, nothing but corn and soybeans for miles around
<Sumica> 00,10so as I said, JJ is full of shit and made all this crap up after the movie tanked so hard
<otakon> Shizuka: how can a movie done in SHAKY CAM have THIS many credits?
<Buytoast> also
<Buytoast> ILLINOIS
<SaxyPretender> 0,14actually, manga and ARG came out before the movie
<Shizuka> 13normal to be precise, was born there, some family still lives there
<VenHur> So, Shizuka...is it likely that they lived?
<RAWRity> Shizuka: so like central NC is with Tobacco
<Shizuka> 13we visit once a year
<Silver_Soother> Shizuka: Don't make fun of Central Illinois! We pride ourselves on soybeans and corn!
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it was an issue of the writers not carrying over the stuff to the movie
<Buytoast> mm
<ntfwc> seriously, watching the scrolling text and listening to the music is more entertaining than the movie.
<Shizuka> 13exactly :3
<otakon> Man I remember the HYPE about this movie trailer
<Buytoast> corn
*SpadeMagnes[R] turns on E.G.G.M.A.N for no reason
<VenHur> I mean...from all that exploshion and what's not.
<pony_666> theres still min of credits for the crap movie?
<Shizuka> 13and having better rain >>
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02HEY, THIS SUMICA GUY IS TALKIN' SHIT ABOUT JJ
<Cypresswolf> looking up the wiki for this movie - Hasbro made merch for a successful opening weekend - 14 inch monster w/ sound & its parasites
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, the song is called ROAR! by Michael Giacchino
<Sumica> 00,10yep
<otakon> Hell there were rumors that it was VOLTRON
<Silver_Soother> Shizuka: We had a good storm last night, shame you missed it.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Are we talking about the pony artist JJ?
<Sumica> 00,10FUCK JJ and all things he touches
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, i wanted that one, Cypresswolf
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: it's also the fact that all this stuff? doesn't need to be explained considering the POV
<Shizuka> 13yeah there was a good system over iowa-illinois-wisconsin
<Shizuka> 13cleanly missed the twin cities though :<
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also also, there's 5 easter eggs in this movie
<Silver_Soother> That's a shame, I was hit by it, and I loved it. :3
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,026 easter eggs if you want to get technical
<ASoftFluffyThing> NewSuperBronyU, he's talking about J. J. Abrahms
<Shizuka> 13no easter egg will ever top gehn singing opera
<Shizuka> 13just putting that out there now >>
<flutterchu> hey.....um.....im the 100,000th visitor of this website
<Shizuka> 13in fact
<flutterchu> crap in ran away
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: the entire POINT of having the POV be from a random uninvolved civillian is that you get into the mindset of somebody who doesn't know what's going on or why. THAT'S where there horror is supposed to come from. Explaining the monster RUINS THAT.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02i liek putting blue and yellow stripes on my easter egg \:3/
<thelonepony> flutterchu: don't click it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14the Dharma initiative logo at the beginning, and 4 screens of classic monster movies including Godzilla and King Kong
<Shizuka> 13and spongebob
<thelonepony> trust me flutterchu
<Shizuka> 13because...
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that's actually why I enjoy the movie itself aside from the ARG, RAWRity
<ntfwc> goodbye credits, I will miss u
<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: so it's not bad enough they made a bad, gimmicky film. They then actively took away anything unique or interesting that DID make it through.
<otakon> ntfwc: I won't
<otakon> and there BETTER be some post credits reveal
<Sumica> 00,10click on it flutterchu, win your I pod nano
<Shizuka> 13nope

<otakon> and now myst
<pony_666> pretty much RAWRity :P
<SpadeMagnes[R]> wut
<RAWRity> that's like cutting somebody's arm and then trying to bandage it by eating asparugus and peeing into their womb.
<twilight_sprinkle> and den Sumica screwed up flutterchu's computer
<VenHur> otakon: Really?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14that little static, reversed, says "It's still alive"
<Shizuka> 13best easter egg right here

<RAWRity> SaxyPretender: funfact: when the phrase "It's alive" was in the first Cloverfield trailors (which were super cryptic and indirect as part of a viral marketing campaign) some thought it said "It's a lion!" and believed it was a live-action Voltron movie.

<taoumi> husky stadium
<taoumi> they are rebuilding that
<Kandarihu> Very punny
<otakon> oh wat
<twilight_sprinkle> NewSuperBronyU: just the scalar center of mass?
<J_E_Smith71> taoumi: Yeah and that's why heh
<MirrorImage> dat Tacoma Narrows
<twilight_sprinkle> or rather mass of center i guess
<Polydunami> A very funny dialect, that Yoda clone did use.
<gold> ...
<otakon> lol
<Polydunami> Welcome to Inception.
<twilight_sprinkle> oh dis, i remember watching this in class
<Sabershy> We must dig deeper.
<taoumi> actauly no J_E_Smith71 the university wants to make more money so they are expanding the stadium to sell mroe tickets
<twilight_sprinkle> but balance actually wasnt why it broke
<Sylandest> dat acting
<twilight_sprinkle> the reason that bridge broke was because its natural frequency was the same as the winds frequency pushing on it
<twilight_sprinkle> so it resonated
<J_E_Smith71> taoumi: I know it was a joke since you said they were rebuilding and they that old clip of it falling
<Kandarihu> You know, I kind of like this Pyro soundboard.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02twilight_sprinkle: Should be a vector since it's a coordinate, not a value.
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - it's much simpler than that
<MirrorImage> "Bridge too thin"
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: bridges are often thin
<MirrorImage> hence, *too* thin
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: the thicker it is, the heavier it is, though
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: that can be a problem if its long
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - you ever tried to bend a steel bar as compared to a paperclip?
<MirrorImage> same concept
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: you would have to build additional suppor
<Polydunami> So terribly unpretentious.
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: its not the same concept...
<Petrified_Discord> No shoes...or socks :P
<Sabershy> No shoes at work.
<MirrorImage> yes it is - yes, you'd have to account for the weight when building the supports
<Petrified_Discord> Grunteld
<twilight_sprinkle> NewSuperBronyU: there are no vectors in that equation though
<MirrorImage> but the road won't wobble like it was
<XylemTube> Now i know!!
<Petrified_Discord> I remember this! This is how I learned how elevators worked! :D
<Polydunami> Whoa, sassy :3
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: well obviously its always better to build it with a bunch of support

<Sylandest> oh god

<AJIsAwesome> HAX!!!!!!!!!!!
<Sylandest> haaaaax
<otakon> hax!
<otakon> HAAAAAAAAAAAAX!
<wowviewer> Boooooooooo >.>
<twilight_sprinkle> ban girls!
<thelonepony> HAX!
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: you girls and your hips :/
<sub06905|TARDIS> i call hax on Shizuka
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - and it wouldn't collapse then
<NocturnalBlade> lol girls be hax :D
<Shizuka> 13bill's got boat :3
*Polydunami is a man and about 5'7"
<Sabershy> Shizuka is female... Hax.
<Polydunami> So, hah :3
<Queen_Chrysalis> my chain snapped xD
<Queen_Chrysalis> LOL
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02twilight_sprinkle: You can get a resulting vector after solving it :3
<XylemTube> Har Har Har
<gold> wooow
<taoumi> that stucture is actualy fiber glass
<AJIsAwesome> HAX!!!!!!!!!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: probably not, but its not always necessary, an optimal solution for price, weight, support was made, because of that resonance situation it broke
<Petrified_Discord> yay song
<Shizuka> 13i didn't have a chain snap.. though i did have the rear derailleur shatter once
<Shizuka> 13that was a fun walk home >>
<gold> tools --> minecraft
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle -yes, but my point is that if the roadway / road beams were thicker, it wouldn't be moving quite so much
<Science_Brony> I'm back. Stupid f*cking chair . . .
<MirrorImage> the road itself would absorb more of the force, rather than all the structural supports
<MirrorImage> yes, the resonance caused the collapse, but only because the road wasn't build thick enough to absorb it
<Buytoast> i wish my bike still worked
<Petrified_Discord> Science_Brony: Just in time for the song OF SCIENCE
<Science_Brony> Petrified_Discord yay~
<MirrorImage> which goes back to my "steel bar vs paperclip" analogy
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: well they tried to optimize it, and it didnt work out
<taoumi> i would point tword wikipedia but it would get yelled at
<Shizuka> 13wasn't it also because the trusses were solid, so the air had to push against the road bed?
<taoumi> there you go Shizuka
<sub06905|TARDIS> puns
<Shizuka> 13that's what i remember, the resonance built up because the air couldn't flow around the bridge so the wind kept pushing it
<sonicandmario85> im drinking chocolate milk the milk is powderd with sugar in it
<gold> *puns* --> *falls down* ...
<taoumi> aeroelastic flutter
<sonicandmario85> all you need to add to powder milk is water and stir it
<Petrified_Discord> Bill Nye: "Some people say that sleeping out under a full moon will cause you to go crazy. Now, I've slept under plenty of full moons. Do I seem crazy to you? HUH? DO I?!"
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: if the air couldnt flow it wouldnt oscillate though, it wouldve just pushed it to a side if i understand what youre saying
<Science_Brony> what are we talking about?
<Sylandest> transitionnnnn~
<twilight_sprinkle> Science_Brony: the collapse of a bridge that was shown
<Science_Brony> ah
<Kandarihu> And there goes the bar again
<J_E_Smith71> And another number added to the pile. It ain't over yet
<Science_Brony> must've missed it
<otakon> more transitions!
<Polydunami> I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING.
<Buytoast> so this is amnesia?
<MirrorImage> ah, here we go
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: hell
<MirrorImage> shizuka, can i post a wiki link?
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, Riven
<Buytoast> loo;s like sim coastere2:Mines of moria

<AJIsAwesome> Night, Sabershy. :)
<Sabershy> Thank you for the stream, Shizuka. :)
<otakon> GARBAGE!
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: :D
<taoumi> thanks Shizuka
<MirrorImage> yep, that was going to be the link
<Science_Brony> err, yeah

<Science_Brony> g'night Sabershy
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - look at the last paragraph there under "Design and Construction" - you'll see what i was referring to
<otakon> well I hate to say it but it's 2 am here
<sub06905|TARDIS> night Sabershy
<otakon> I gotta go for now
<Starchaser> i hate bill nye >_>

<sonicandmario85> otakon:1:04 AM here
<Sabershy> Night otakon. :P
<otakon> Shizuka: thanks for the stream!
<sub06905|TARDIS> bai otakon
<otakon> night all take care!
<Science_Brony> g'night otakon
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, otakon :)
<taoumi> nighty otakon
<NocturnalBlade> nite otakon
<Science_Brony> 2kg per day, per person?
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: im not denying they shouldve made it thicker, but it says "This change was a substantial contributor to the difference in the projected costs of the designs." so they did it to save money and they screwed up
<Science_Brony> holy shit
<TheRandomkid321> What is this? ANd who is streaming?
<twilight_sprinkle> ew
<sonicandmario85> i feel bad for all the sprite i ever drank now
<J_E_Smith71> TheRandomkid321: Bill Nye, streamed by Shizuka
<Science_Brony> TheRandomkid321 Bill Nye the Science Guy - Garbage. Shizu's streaming
<TheRandomkid321> I assumed it was Bill Nye.
<Science_Brony> you made a correct assumption
<sonicandmario85> BILL NUYE THE APERTURE SCIENCE GUY
<taoumi> the pony in the corner is missing so you can't tell right away
<Shizuka> 13fair warning, compost piles REEK
<sonicandmario85> nye*
<taoumi> YES
<Science_Brony> Shizuka ugh, tell me about it
<TheRandomkid321> Suddenly LAG!
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - maybe it's just my local compost pile, but i actually find the smell rather fruity
<twilight_sprinkle> smelly science
<J_E_Smith71> taoumi: Well you can tell Shizuka's streaming because she has the little numbered status bar at the bottom
<sonicandmario85> taoumi:i know when shizukas streaming because of the little video thing on the bottum of the screen
<Kandarihu> Yeah. KMPlayer IIRC.
<MirrorImage> J_E_Smith71 - and because each time we say "Shizuka," it goes "ba-ding"
<MirrorImage> >_>
<Shizuka> 13pings shouldn't actually be getting through >>
<Shizuka> 13unless they do when i have line 1 on for soundboaring
<sonicandmario85> Shizuka
<sonicandmario85> XD
<taoumi> bing
<Gunthler> Panda :3
*Gunthler noms Panda
<taoumi> srsly.. that name. fresh kills
<Kandarihu> She's also one of the mods who sometimes streams TF2, but she hasn't lately.
<Shizuka> 13HIPPY ALERT
<Buytoast> SPIRIT JOURNEY TIME
<taoumi> native american
<sonicandmario85> I LIKE HIPPIES!
<Kandarihu> She did some Trackmania United Forever the other day. Hey Shizuka, have you made a Mania Zone yet?
<taoumi> not all hippies
<Shizuka> 13nope
<sonicandmario85> but i love every hippie in the world
<taoumi> now they have mukelshoot casino
<sonicandmario85> not really XD
<Buytoast> oh god
<Shizuka> 13oh the 90s
<taoumi> -_(\
<Buytoast> TAYKATDATRAYAYASHA
<Shizuka> 13they're going to be the future... kid there are soooooo many more ways they're hosed than garbage buildup
<taoumi> rly
<Shizuka> 13cause we've pretty much got garbage down to a science, garbage compacts easily
<Queen_Chrysalis> VAN DYKE XD
<sub06905|TARDIS> luna!
<Shizuka> 13taking all garbage in the US into one big landfill would be like 100 miles square if i remember right
<J_E_Smith71> Yep that 90s heavy save the world environment stuff
<Buytoast> what a shame
<klobb> I read something similar too, Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13that's why how it's made recycles plastic
<Buytoast> plastic plastic plastic
<twilight_sprinkle> bill nye mustve discovered many wonderful smells during this episode
<taoumi> and then they went back to celulose base plastics that will biodegrade
<Shizuka> 13yep, run out of places, planet's kind of big bill
<thelonepony> night everypony, got school tomorrow ;3;
<taoumi> the first plastics were actualy celulose. then they found petro lwas so much cheeper
<NocturnalBlade> nite thelonepony
<Polydunami> Good night, thelonepony
<AJIsAwesome> Night, thelonepony. :)
<MirrorImage> i say we build a giant cannon that fires trash into the sun
<twilight_sprinkle> bye thelonepony
<Kandarihu> My mom and I recycle. Every other Tuesday, I lay about 5+ bags of plastic, metal, and paper on the front lawn to be picked up for recycling.
<NocturnalBlade> play them off johnny
<Polydunami> Family Guy was not first :D
<Buytoast> no shit
<Polydunami> Err, yeah. No fucking shit.
<XylemTube> did somebody mention BP?
<taoumi> we should make a giant ball then use our mob ties to buy a rocket and fire it into space
<Buytoast> i recycled when i lived on campus
<Shizuka> 13was it the EPA that did that three Rs thing.. cause god that was EEEEVERYWHEEERE in the 90s
<MirrorImage> inb4RainbowDashCutieMark
<sub06905|TARDIS> EEEEEPAAAA
<taoumi> i AM AN ADULT
<Shizuka> 13this kid so grows up to be a brony
<Shizuka> 13we all know it
<sub06905|TARDIS> lol
<J_E_Smith71> Recycle, Reduce, Reuse, and close the loop we can close the loop
<Buytoast> "Reduce. Reuse. Recycle. Die."
<J_E_Smith71> Oh god I remember those ads
<Science_Brony> Shizuka it was EEEEEEEVERYWHEEEERE long after the 90's
<J_E_Smith71> "If don't be kind to Mother Nature she'll kick our butts!"
<Polydunami> Basically, rainbow is light.
<twilight_sprinkle> Die. FOR SCIENCE
<Polydunami> Light is part of SCIENCE!
<Shizuka> 13that's why we burn it
<twilight_sprinkle> i havent thrown out a bottle in months, i just reuse the one i have
<taoumi> i keep my soada bottles to put achohol in
<Cypresswolf> now all of a sudden, the only thing I can think about is John Ritter telling me to recycle :D
<twilight_sprinkle> but i only drink tap water though
<twilight_sprinkle> mostly that is
<Polydunami> I know this name
<taoumi> :D
<taoumi> close your mouth
<klobb> I go through a couple bottles everyday since I don't trust the water on my job site.
<Shizuka> 13and then how it's made shows us they can chew up huge piles of tires for a whooole lot of new rubber
<Science_Brony> eeyup
<Kandarihu> Man, I hate being downwind of people who burn leaves. I can't air out the house when the air gets all smoky.
<twilight_sprinkle> klobb: back when i lived in a dorm, i didnt trust the water there either, so i boiled it
<taoumi> mmmm
<Shizuka> 13recycle antifreeze... where exactly?
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - local auto part store could probably tell you
<taoumi> dogs do sadly
<Polydunami> No facilities?
<Cypresswolf> put that anti freeze back in your car, and recycle it
<DocSane> You dispose of car waste at service stations.
<MirrorImage> i think most of them have at least some kind of large vat for used motor oil
<twilight_sprinkle> owaw
<Shizuka> 13we drink it raw?
<twilight_sprinkle> nuuu it killed plankton
<Buytoast> damn bill
<Shizuka> 13bill, it's called city tap, we invented it for a reason >>
<twilight_sprinkle> owaw, hes actually swimming in garbage
<Polydunami> So coffee?
<MirrorImage> not sure if dubstep or Stomp
<DocSane> Can anyone tell me what the winners of the lottery this week are?
<Shizuka> 13frosted CORN SHARDS
<taoumi> stomp
<Buytoast> Corn Shards
<Cypresswolf> aww yeah! aww I was just starting to jam :(
<Science_Brony> Shizuka there are places you can take "toxic substances", such as batteries, dirty oil, and used antifreeze. We just take it to our local landfil and they do something with it from then on
<Shizuka> 13at least little boxes like that are pretty dead
<Buytoast> "If you're going to cut your mouth, do it with Corn!"
<Kandarihu> The only other people on my street who recycle live far down the street from me. Everyone else has overflowing dumpsters every Thursday.
<DocSane> I generate about one kitchen bag of garbage a week.
<Cypresswolf> I havent seen those little cereal boxes in ages
<J_E_Smith71> DocSane: I actually can't remember, but I know for B we have a three hour TV movie followed by Return of Harmony both parts, so it'll be a long one
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: Same here.
<Shizuka> 13i think we average two a week, plus a full can of recycling
<Buytoast> just to spite this brat, i;m going to only use little boxes
<Queen_Chrysalis> i want cerial now -.-
<Queen_Chrysalis> lol
<Buytoast> also
<DocSane> A three hour TV movie?
<Buytoast> that's one giant ass box
<Kandarihu> Moon goes woosh
<AJIsAwesome> DocSane: Yep.
<Cypresswolf> I loved getting a 10 pack - eat my favorite cereals first :) and the rest just sat on the counter collecting dust
<DaringDerpy> hello
<Polydunami> So where is the fetus?
<Science_Brony> hi DaringDerpy
<Shizuka> 13VAC why you stuttering...
<DocSane> AJIsAwesome: Now I'm intrigued.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, DaringDerpy. :)
<Science_Brony> Space Oddessy 2000?
<NocturnalBlade> hi DaringDerpy
<AJIsAwesome> DocSane: Me too. :)
<Polydunami> More like 2001
<Science_Brony> oh
<XylemTube> Recycleing odesy
<Science_Brony> never saw the movie
<MirrorImage> Thinking? in MURICA?
<MirrorImage> herecy
<Kandarihu> MirrorImage, it's more likely than you think.
<Jmo> heresy.
<Shizuka> 13imma counterpoint poor bill after this
<Shizuka> 13:3
<MirrorImage> Kandarihu - Honey Boo Boo.
<DocSane> Okay, I need to wake up in four hours. Jury duty tomorrow. Wish me luck that I get released at noon, folks.
<twilight_sprinkle> wasnt the same as the odyssey song(which is actually from strauss maybe? dont remember), me thinks they changed it a bit to avoid copyright
<J_E_Smith71> DocSane: Kung Fu Hustle and The Color of Magic
<MirrorImage> your argument is invalid
<AJIsAwesome> Night, DocSane. :
<twilight_sprinkle> bye DocSane
<J_E_Smith71> Had to check the backlog for a sec
<AJIsAwesome> *:)
<DocSane> J_E_Smith71: Thanks
<AJIsAwesome> Good luck!
<Cypresswolf> Bill Nye Rants! :) How I love these
<Shizuka> 13if a product can't be recycled, don't throw it out?
<DocSane> Night, all.
<Cypresswolf> For crying out loud!
<Science_Brony> g'night doctor_whooves127
<Science_Brony> GAH
<Kandarihu> MirrorImage, not all Americans are into that. Please don't stereotype us.
<Science_Brony> g'night docs-
<Science_Brony> dah
<XylemTube> oh god, another one of these
<J_E_Smith71> Oh man this was an actual commerical
<AJIsAwesome> DAT PYRO
<XylemTube> *boop*
<Shizuka> 13problem is this is pretty much the only bill nye song i remembered before getting this torrent .-.
<J_E_Smith71> It had animated recycle products in the shape of the letters
<Shizuka> 13it's awful..
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah MirrorImage not funny
<Science_Brony> Is anypony here (besides the mods) old enough to remember when commercials were interesting?
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: and im not even american.
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - hence my point?
<AJIsAwesome> Honey Boo Boo is a disgrace to television and it never should've existed. It should've even been PLANNED.
<MirrorImage> i live in Pennsylvania anyways
<ShadowReaper898> :D Pyro
<Silver_Soother> Good to know Pyro is into it.
<Polydunami> Is that NewSuperBronyU in the background?
<AJIsAwesome> *SHouldn't
<J_E_Smith71> There was also that Rocko episode. "R-E-C-Y-C-LE Recycle, C-O-N-S-E-R-V-E Conserve..."
<Kandarihu> Science_Brony, I still find some commercials interesting.
<PeachStreak> dat pyro yell
<Silver_Soother> AJIsAwesome: Yeah; well, the bar has been lowered pretty low, can't get much worse then this.
<Shizuka> 13OOOOOOOO HE SAID A BAD WORD
<Buytoast> i heard that
<twilight_sprinkle> what did he say?
<Shizuka> 13blew the take and muttered 'shit'
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<Cypresswolf> Honey Boo Boo exists because shows like Diamonds & Tiaras are being watched
<AJIsAwesome> I feel bad for those children.
<Cypresswolf> Toddlers & Tiaras
<Silver_Soother> AJIsAwesome: The worst part of it all is the fact that show is on TLC... TLC of all channels...
<AJIsAwesome> Silver_Soother: I know.....*sigh*....
<Polydunami> Cypresswolf :D
<taoumi> does we get jurneyman?
<twilight_sprinkle> oh boi
<Science_Brony> Penn and Teller
<Silver_Soother> I love Bullshit. :D
<Buytoast> penn and teller?
<Science_Brony> heh
<Polydunami> Okay, too bad we get mixed messages.
<Silver_Soother> Please; tell me, where did you get this?
<Cypresswolf> TLC really went downhill :| The Learning Channel? :D there's nothing worth learning about on that channel anymore
<Shizuka> 13i've had the torrent for months
<Shizuka> 13luna streamed some earlier this year
<taoumi> "/
<Silver_Soother> Okay, I guess I just dont know how to internet. xD
<Cypresswolf> :O Bacon too fatty? NEVER!
<Spectrum_Rush> lugnuts?
<Science_Brony> bacon is . . . meh
<Silver_Soother> So much love for Teller. <3
<Cypresswolf> I'm instantly loving this :)
<Shizuka> 13is the baby really necessary in the shot
<Silver_Soother> Cypresswolf: As you should, it's an awesome show. They still have a version of this on Discovery last I knew of.
<Cypresswolf> the baby is to prove she's a Real Mom
<Silver_Soother> Shizuka: Gotta get her baby out there somehow.
<Shizuka> 13yeah i think they ended after season 8 or so, then moved to a new thing
<Shizuka> 13it's got what plants crave?
<Polydunami> Eight seasons of this bullshit? :3
<Buytoast> that wasteful ass
<Silver_Soother> That poor guy...
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Buytoast> an entire bag of food
<Buytoast> who does that
<Shizuka> 13might do some more next time :)
<Science_Brony> Shizuka yes, it's to show that she is a caring mother. It's also to draw attention. Baby = "cute". "Cute" = views.
<Polydunami> So?
<Kandarihu> Is there an episode on this about anthropogenic climate change?
<Science_Brony> it's a gimmick
<MirrorImage> "More people recycle than vote" - that's because a lot of places make recycling a law, unlike voting
<Shizuka> 13i think so, i'll check
<Silver_Soother> Kandarihu: Yes, there is.
<Shizuka> 13there's a general one about environmentalism
<Shizuka> 13that one's pretty good
<ShadowReaper898> night everypony
<Cypresswolf> I dont recycle - the trash end up in the city dump anyway, let them city folk sort it out
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, ShadowReaper898. :)
<Buytoast> HA
<Polydunami> Good night, ShadowReaper898
<NocturnalBlade> nite shadow

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Dj_Cyber-4G. :)
<taoumi> okie Dj_Cyber-4G
<Science_Brony> hi Dj_Cyber-4G
<Silver_Soother> Dj_Cyber-4G: Enjoy your stay whilst you can! :)
<Cypresswolf> Global Warming included?
<pony_1066> Silver_Soother: That goes by the name . . . ?
<Shizuka> 13i love this gag so much
<Shizuka> 13this is just the best
<Silver_Soother> pony_1066: Yup, its the show "Bullshit" hosted by Penn and Teller.
<Cypresswolf> Bullshit Recycling Truck of Science
<Silver_Soother> I suddenly just had flash backs to this episode. God I love this show. <3
<Shizuka> 13just watch how horrible this gets
<Science_Brony> Cypresswolf I approve of this
<Silver_Soother> This is the recycling for the OCD.
<Science_Brony> how many is that, 8?
<Dj_Cyber-4G> wow a lot of Doctor Who fan-based names in the chat box
<AJIsAwesome> ............
<Shizuka> 13japan

<Shizuka> 13brodude
<Silver_Soother> Dj_Cyber-4G: There just MAY be a few DR. Who fans. :P
<Shizuka> 13modude
<Cypresswolf> so just throw plastic bottles in the trash then...ok
<sub06905|TARDIS> mobro :D
<Silver_Soother> I wish I was into Dr. Who, but I have no one to enjoy it with me. :(
<Dj_Cyber-4G> im a big Doctor Who fan myself

<Shizuka> 13DAN
<JRP> NewSuperBronyU: write me a story
<Shizuka> 13VS
<Shizuka> 13THE EPA
<Cypresswolf> I await the day when space travel becomes cheaper & more mainstream - then we could just shoot off all that trash to the nearest star
<sub06905|TARDIS> i need to get the 11th doctor's screwdriver next
<DaringDerpy> https://images.4chan.org/b/src/1350281903422.jpg
<Science_Brony> Shizuka that actualy sounds interesting
<Dj_Cyber-4G> my friend has that
<Polydunami> o_O blarg.
<sub06905|TARDIS> i only have the 10th's screwdriver
<Dj_Cyber-4G> 4CHAN SUX (sorry for caps)
<Kandarihu> I could imagine how a Dan vs the EPA episode would go.
<Shizuka> 13the new york times, the polar opposite of all that
<Science_Brony> New York Times is overrated
<Polydunami> Even worse, it's a Cupcakes reference :|
<Silver_Soother> Okay, Who-fans, where should I start watching the show? I really need to know where to start.
<Science_Brony> when it's involved with something, people go all over it
<XylemTube> so much conservative XD
<Shizuka> 13NYT is so much a shill they don't even hide it anymore
<DaringDerpy> Cypresswolf: It has to become far more reliable too. Imagine a transport with radioactive or toxic waste explodes in the atmosphere. Problem.
<Dj_Cyber-4G> hey look.... (mudders) NO NOT POLITICS NO!!!
<Science_Brony> iIt says something's good, people automatically love it. It says something's bad, people automatically hate it.
<Science_Brony> *It
<taoumi> actualy alot of times farmers are paied subsidies to NOT grow certain crops
<Shizuka> 13yep
<DaringDerpy> cupcakes are cool
<Kandarihu> My recycling program only requires ANY sorting to happen if I miss the recycling trucks.
<Shizuka> 13ours just says nothing hazardous like batteries and not frozen food things
<Polydunami> In other words, they're worse than us.
<Shizuka> 13these poor guys
<Science_Brony> I recycle pop cans and bottles. That's about it.
<Shizuka> 13ohai wrek
<Silver_Soother> Work for us minions!
<twilight_sprinkle> GO FOR A THREE-POINTER
<taoumi> oooo wrek is on
<taoumi> that's early
<twilight_sprinkle> OHHHH and she misses...
<Science_Brony> hi Wrek
<J_E_Smith71> If you get them all right in one minute you win this fabulous prize
<sub06905|TARDIS> all the trash!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Wrek. :)
<taoumi> lol rainbow
<Science_Brony> >pizza
<Science_Brony> >wet food
<Science_Brony> what the flying fuck
<DaringDerpy> we have a garbage chute on every floor. all the trash goes into a non-transparent plastic bag and down there
<MirrorImage> Science_Brony - "Will it leave a mark on your clothing? Yes/No"
<Polydunami> Yeah, use bullshit to denounce bullshit :P
<sub06905|TARDIS> now if we had that many trash cans in every house
<Shizuka> 13penn, what have you created... YOU'VE DOOMED US ALL
<Polydunami> Then again, it is proving a point
<DaringDerpy> in the end, they burn it all in the same power plant anyway
<Silver_Soother> Always bothered me the fact it took me 5 seconds to throw away from trash. Instead, give me an hour to deal with trash. Eeyup....
<Dj_Cyber-4G> 4chan is complete rubbish
<Polydunami> How do you know that, Dj_Cyber-4G?
<Science_Brony> because it's 4chan
<Science_Brony> requires no explanation
<Dj_Cyber-4G> were you there for the war? i think not!
<DaringDerpy> 4chan created the brony phenomenon
<XylemTube> Didn't bronydom start at 4chan?
<Buytoast> it did
<pony_1066> My problem here is that even if we accept the problems of recycling as they show them, it doesn't really justify throwing things we could recycle in the landfills.
<XylemTube> or whatever
<DaringDerpy> you probably heard of it
<Cypresswolf> local grocery store parking lot used to have a can crushing machine - that was taken out in around 95 - dont think there are any left now
<MirrorImage> be careful when you say "bronydom started at 4chan"
<Kandarihu> pony_1066, I agree
<Dj_Cyber-4G> YEAH IN THE WAR THE BRONY'S WERE CREATED... that doesn't make 4chan any better
<MirrorImage> too many people automatically assume 4chan = /b/
<Polydunami> Yeah, that was not the fault of 4chan. I should not have to let you know that there are people behind those keyboards.
<Buytoast> people just prefer to go to LE REDDIT XDXD and such because they can't handle people disagreeing with them
<Shizuka> 13our can crusher actually broke >>
<Buytoast> and being honest
<DaringDerpy> MirrorImage?
<Shizuka> 13LELELELELELELELELE
<Dj_Cyber-4G> we created ourselves out of the dust
<Cypresswolf> those old can crushers are harder to find than phone booths]
<twilight_sprinkle> if you keep starting from scratch, youll run out of material and places to store the garbage
<MirrorImage> DaringDerpy - a lot of people will use 4chan and /b/ - slash - anonymous interchangeably
<Polydunami> All these people are saying is bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
<Cypresswolf> :) I used to fill some of those old cans with sand to make them weigh more so we got more change back
<Science_Brony> Polydunami that's why they call the show "Penn and Teller: Bullshit"
<DaringDerpy> well...it was /co/...the wars on /b/ did their part too
<Kandarihu> Yes. Paper and wood are renuable resources. Yet most of the recycling I do IS paper
<Dj_Cyber-4G> more political nonsience
<pony_1066> Earth isn't an entirely closed system--we do get some energy from the sun, but hardly enogh to offset what we waste, nor do we have the space to just keep throwing more energy into landfills.
<Shizuka> 13teller is hax
<Shizuka> 13nerfplx
<Shizuka> 13dammit vac
<taoumi> that was cool trick
<Science_Brony> he just turned shredded paper into a hat
<Science_Brony> dufuq
<Shizuka> 13sec
<taoumi> uuuu
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry guys, I have to get some sleep. Good night and enjoy Shizu's stream! :)
<Science_Brony> g'night AJIsAwesome
<taoumi> yey~
<NocturnalBlade> nite AJIsAwesome|Sleep
<DaringDerpy> night AJIsAwesome|Sleep
<twilight_sprinkle> goot naight AJIsAwesome|Sleep :)
<Science_Brony> SCREENCAP THIS
<Kandarihu> VAC?
<Science_Brony> DO IT NAO
<Cypresswolf> Goodnight AJIsAwesome|Sleep
<J_E_Smith71> Night AJIsAwesome|Sleep
<taoumi> night AJIsAwesome|Sleep
<Silver_Soother> Night AJIsAwesome|Sleep Sleep well.
<Shizuka> 13stupid vac....
<sub06905|TARDIS> night AJIsAwesome|Sleep
<Shizuka> 13there we go
<taoumi> woot
<Kandarihu> Science_Brony, I fail to see the humor in a freezeframe without a buffer circle
*AJIsAwesome|Sleep hugs Science_Brony NocturnalBlade DaringDerpy twilight_sprinkle Cypresswolf J_E_Smith71 taoumi Silver_Soother and sub06905|TARDIS good night. :)
<pony_1066> As for this paper bit--the problem isn't just cutting down old trees . . . because, it's cutting down old-growth trees because such trees are part of old-growth forests, which are important to the environment in general. Tree farms are in no way an acceptable replacement for a forest that's been around longer than the human race.
<Shizuka> 13now and then it gets stuck in a CPU bottleneck
<Science_Brony> Kandarihu did you not see the buffer circle?
<Shizuka> 13didn't buffer, just paused while i poked around
<Science_Brony> oh
<AJIsAwesome|Sleep> Take care, everyone. :)
<Science_Brony> ok, ignore me
<J_E_Smith71> Kandarihu: Unless the streamer pauses and backs up on purpose so we can cap a funny face
<DaringDerpy> putting people in threadmills for energy production can create millions of jobs
<DaringDerpy> and it's eco friendly too
<Shizuka> 13and we don't cause it's a monumental waste of effort better put to better tasks
<pony_1066> A dirty job is worse than no job? Mike Rowe would like to speak with you.
<Science_Brony> "running out of space"
<Science_Brony> bullshit
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/PXC8g.png
<TheRandomkid321> EPA
<taoumi> trash energy works.... it's suuuper stanky though
<twilight_sprinkle> wait i mustve msised something, how is it worse for the environment
<Rosfox> :O
*AdamTheDuck licks TheRandomkid321 :P
<Shizuka> 13i love bait and switch jokes like that :3
<pony_1066> Science_Brony: who are you talking to?
<TheRandomkid321> AdamTheDuck... ew.... i'm used to it though
<Science_Brony> pony_1066 myself, as usual
<taoumi> i thought it was going to end up with biat. but .....
<Silver_Soother> Science_Brony: We all end up background noise at some point. :3
<Science_Brony> How the governemt works.
<Science_Brony> it doesn't
<twilight_sprinkle> so what exactly is ther big solution, just ignore everything and be wasteful?
<Shizuka> 13there it is
<Shizuka> 13oh... i wasn't even close with my estimate
<pony_1066> twilight_sprinkle: they don't feel a need to provide solutions--they just bitch at the things people are trying.
<taoumi> it's pandora
<taoumi> :3
<Silver_Soother> taoumi: Indeed. Lol.
<Science_Brony> taoumi I was just playing Borderlands 2 :D
<Kandarihu> I'd like to show this to my mother sometimes, but the f word makes this a no-sell.
<Science_Brony> that is so true
<DaringDerpy> pony_1066: the people trying do it with other people's money
<Shizuka> 13penn's pretty hard libertarian, the problem with government funded makework is it's government funded makework
<Kandarihu> ...then again, maybe she might be able to bear it for this.
<Shizuka> 13that's taking money away from consumers that would otherwise be put to uses the market actually wants
<Science_Brony> ie roads
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: I would rather waste money trying than save money by trying nothing--nothing ventured, nothing gained.
<Shizuka> 13well... government is DAMN good at wasting money
<twilight_sprinkle> ^^^^
<pony_1066> At the very least you could learn how to do it better.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^^
<Shizuka> 13see solyndra and a slew of other green job failures >>
<twilight_sprinkle> money is Supposed to be wasted on these things
<Kandarihu> WHAT? It all gets buried?
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah it could be better
<twilight_sprinkle> but life isnt about eating up all the money you can
<Shizuka> 13no it isn't, money is a method of transferring effort to goods
<DaringDerpy> pony_1066 you would waste resources for nothing...that's the opposite of efficiency or green
<Kandarihu> ...power from decomposing garbage? ...AWESOME!
<Shizuka> 13taking money and diverting it to things the market doesn't actually want has vastly worse consequences down the line
<DaringDerpy> material that is worth being recycled gets recycled. the rest can be burned
<XylemTube> He;;s not kidding those landfills really do burn methane for power
<Science_Brony> MANDATORY
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: like i said, it Could be better, but if its helping even slightly, with something as important as the world ecology, it should be done. yeah it could be improved, bnut im not sure i believe this show
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: It's not wasted if you learn from failure.
<Shizuka> 13the collective might of millions of humans is more efficient than the decree of a few politicians
<pony_1066> Assuming it fails.
<taoumi> trash for the trash god
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - it turns out going naked 24/7 is helpful for the environment.
<Kandarihu> But... decomposing garbage gets... recycled into Methane gas.
<MirrorImage> would you do it?
<Shizuka> 13but also, everyone should be required to read this http://steshaw.org/economics-in-one-lesson/
<DaringDerpy> pony_1066: it's wasted if you failed because you didn't do the math before
<pony_1066> @Shizuka: who exactly do you think does what politcians decree?
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: why
<Kandarihu> It's not the community who betrayed her.
<Shizuka> 13people who are threatened with fines or jailtime if they don't comply
<Shizuka> 13who do YOU think does it?
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: It's wasted even more if you don't do anything with it at all.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<TheRandomkid321> ^^
<twilight_sprinkle> obviusly the government isnt being honest
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - think about it. less water wasted on laundry. less factory work making the clothing. less wasted materials that could be used for other things.
<Shizuka> 13no see you're thinking in zero sum terms
<Science_Brony> THIS
<J_E_Smith71> Oh thank you Shiz
<DaringDerpy> pony_1066: so brainless actionism?
<XylemTube> The ep about swaering!
<Science_Brony> THIS is one of my favourites
<twilight_sprinkle> but since we cant do anything about it unless we go into politics, we should at least spend the money to slightly improve the ecology
<taoumi> :D
<Panda> you know... this might be the first night i actually go to bed before Shizuka...
<XylemTube> BURN
<J_E_Smith71> We go from Trash to Spongbob Trash talking
<flufflepuff> working off the clock
<DaringDerpy> more trash tv?
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: ...really
<Panda|Sleepies> Night night bstate!
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: and how would we live during the winter
<Polydunami> Good night, Panda
<pony_1066> @Shizuka: You're right. Everything ever mandated by the government is done by prisoners. Sounds legit.
<NocturnalBlade> nite Panda|Sleepies
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: or would we hibernate
<Science_Brony> g'night Panda|Sleepies
<AdamTheDuck> Night Panda|Sleepies
<TheRandomkid321> Krabs is a FUCKWITR
<taoumi> you kiss your mouth with that mother?
<twilight_sprinkle> night Panda|Sleepies
<DaringDerpy> good night Panda|Sleepies
<Shizuka> 13pony_1066: don't pay your taxes for a while and then tell me it's voluntary to pay for wasteful government programs
<Kandarihu> Krabs is a dolphin
<flufflepuff> you know for kids
<Silver_Soother> Sentence enhancer? Like Entenze for your grammar?
<MirrorImage> twilight_sprinkle - it was mostly a rhetorical point
<XylemTube> LOVEING FUCKIN DAY
<Panda|Sleepies> and I exit on tax evasion XD
<taoumi> i don't have an option to pay pay my taxes. it gets pulled out of my check
*Panda|Sleepies noms twilight_sprinkle
<flufflepuff> wow
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: its better to waste it on these things than on pointless luxury
<flufflepuff> just wow
*twilight_sprinkle nomz Panda|Sleepies ^.^
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: so you know how better to spend my money than i do?
<twilight_sprinkle> MirrorImage: okay
<Shizuka> 13that's pretty much diametrically opposed to what the country was founded on
<DaringDerpy> twilight_sprinkle: pointless luxury like bronystate?
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: No, just action over inaction. no one else did anything as far as I know. At least someone is trying in this regard.
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: idk, im saying for the average person. basically i msaying that even if inefficient, its still a worth ycause
<TheRandomkid321> HOW THE FUCK ARE YA!?
<Science_Brony> Sad fact of life: I swear more in one day than all the swears heard total in this episode.
<taoumi> dem kids
<Shizuka> 13pony_1066: inaction in something you're focusing on, but it becomes action in something else that otherwise wouldn't get done
<J_E_Smith71> I expect that kind of talk from Denny's but this place?
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: i dont spend money it
<DaringDerpy> pony_1066: as I said, actionism for the sake of actionism.
<XylemTube> fuck fuck fuckity fuck
<Cypresswolf> :D Im surprised Nick allowed this after getting Angry Beavers cancelled for saying "shutup"
<pony_1066> @Shizuka: I'm an anarchist--I don't think government si the best way for humans to live. But unless you have a magical solution, I'll bear with it for now.
<Cypresswolf> *breaks out Happy Snacks*
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: also dont worry, i dont buy games or movies
<Shizuka> 13mmm anarchists
<Dj_Cyber-4G> WOA IM LATE!!!! GOODBYE EVERYPONY SEE YOU ALL TOMMOROW!
<Shizuka> 13the most idealistic of all~
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Dj_Cyber-4G
<taoumi> nighty Dj_Cyber-4G
<flufflepuff> It's funny that Derpy caused such an uproar, but not this
<Sumica> 00,10well that felt like an exploit if I ever saw one in PS2
<Shizuka> 13spoiiiiits~
<XylemTube> Mekrob
<Science_Brony> I can think of 8
<Shizuka> 13there's an l in there somewhere..
<Cypresswolf> was that a George Carlin reference? :3
<Shizuka> 13well you have the canonical seven from carlin
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: If someone were developing a better plan, I'd like to see it. Otherwise, complaining seems like an exercise in bitching.
<Shizuka> 13sort of, as i recall he has fuck and motherfucker, which is a bit redundant
<Kandarihu> It's dangerous to confuse libertarians with anarchists. In the face of overbearing government, it's hard to tell the difference, though.
<Ponyloverforever> Hello everypony!! :)
<DaringDerpy> pony_1066: you don't get it
<Sumica> 00,10almost empty server, enter huge base as infltrater, cap one item station go max, thrash base, fo engi, capture base, repair base
<Science_Brony> hi Ponyloverforever
<Spectrum_Rush> ahh George Carlin, probably my favorite comedian ever
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: Apparently not.
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_1066: anarchy wouldnt let people develop, l=plus i suspect people would band together and control others anyway
<Polydunami> Hey there, Ponyloverforever
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Ponyloverforever
<SirGanjalf> mornin' everypony
<Shizuka> 13anarchy offers the least amount of freedom because you are always focused on protecting your own property
<AdamTheDuck> And hello SirGanjalf :P
<Ponyloverforever> Morning SirGanjait
<Shizuka> 13those with the biggest guns gather the power and you end up in a monarchy
<sub06905|TARDIS> :D
<TheRandomkid321> Troll dice
<XylemTube> this is me when i play TF2]
<NocturnalBlade> hello Ponyloverforever and SirGanjalf
<awesomes8wc3> :D
<taoumi> you said the bluluva
<DaringDerpy> anarchy is unstable. you can see it in every slum of the world. gangs deliver security and take political power quite fast
<Science_Brony> hi SirGanjalf
<J_E_Smith71> This is me when I play anything:p
<pony_1066> twilight_sprinkle @Shizuka I'm glad both of you noticed that I'm content with the current system. Besides, the anarchy I think of is not the anarchy you are thinking of.
<Shizuka> 13dat face
<Rosfox> :D
<pony_1066> Screenshotted
<Ponyloverforever> woah
<Shizuka> 13favorite part of the episode there
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_1066: nobody likes the current system, it should get a kick in the ass
<Shizuka> 13dammit vac...
<J_E_Smith71> I' ll cap it after wards
<Science_Brony> J_E_Smith71 this is an average conversation when I'm not around parents, teachers, my sister, and the like.
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: http://i.imgur.com/fHL2W.png
<NocturnalBlade> he said some things <_<
<Shizuka> 13wish i knew why it starts derping like that..
<pony_1066> twilight_sprinkle: I said content, not liking.
<Kandarihu> So the Valve Anti Cheating is CPU spiking?
<Flyboy> DADADADADDADADA
<MirrorImage> Spectrum_Rush - "GASP! Who said they don't like ponies?"
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_1066: i know, im agreeing :P
<pony_1066> This is anarchism in its proper form, not that nonsense the media has impressed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_1066: imo the main problem of the world right now is peoples' egoism and how they put their own wellbeing above all else
<J_E_Smith71> Never mind seems Spectrum_Rush somehow knows how to get them fast before I can
<Sumica> 00,10derping how Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13starts stuttering like that
<MirrorImage> no stutter on our end
<Sumica> 00,10oh
<Polydunami> Is it never going to be revealed?
<Shizuka> 13least i assume it goes through to... wow really?
<awesomes8wc3> run
<Science_Brony> HA! I understand that joke now!
<Sumica> 00,10yep no studder
<DaringDerpy> www.ebay.com/itm/Large-Princess-Celestia-Chibi-Plushie-My-Little-Pony-FIM-/251166840793
<Science_Brony> Goes to show how little I watch this show nowadays.
<Shizuka> 13unless maybe it's windows' forwarding from line 1 to speakers, whereas fmle is taking line 1 directly
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIL!! 0.0
<sub06905|TARDIS> :D
<taoumi> it's the elder swear
<awesomes8wc3> :[
<flufflepuff> :O
<DaringDerpy> pony_1066: proper form? anarchism is not a sect.
<Science_Brony> :D
<J_E_Smith71> So how did they know the other 12?
<SirGanjalf> I think i'll reinstall TF2 before Halloween, cause error reports are gettin unbearable
<Sumica> 00,10would depend alot on the set up Shizuka
<Science_Brony> J_E_Smith71 it's Spongebob.
<Flyboy> such a scream of ***************** have i ever heard in my days
<Shizuka> 13kmplayer goes to line 1 via directsound, windows copies line 1 to speaker output, fmle takes line 1 directly
<Science_Brony> . . . why am I still on SCIENCE(!!!)?
<Shizuka> 13i don't use the repeater
<Polydunami> But she was not all dead :P
<Canadian_Brony> that's better
<Shizuka> 13old people know the more classic swears
<SirGanjalf> agagagaga
<J_E_Smith71> There was another cappable bit
<Kencolt> That one isn't on the list even.
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: Yes, it is. Anarchy has many different divisions and shades. It's not simply chaos.
<sub06905|TARDIS> :D
<Flyboy> o.o
<awesomes8wc3> wHooaAAAAaa
<XylemTube> Welp
<Sumica> 00,10no need to use the repeater if you have win 7 unless you want to talk on stream Shizuka *snicker*
<Ponyloverforever> thanks for stream
<Cypresswolf> That was a great stream, Thanks Shizuka :)
<sub06905|TARDIS> tnx Shizuka :)
<Queen_Chrysalis> trippyyyy
<J_E_Smith71> And this concludes our Shizuka broadcast day
<Polydunami> And this is the part where we all say THANKS SHIZUKA :3
<Shizuka> 13there, just started stuttering here
<Flyboy> thx for the stream Shizuka
<Sumica> 00,10now i hear it
<Silver_Soother> I always get a bit sad when I hear this music. Thanks for the stream Shizuka :D
<Canadian_Brony> yeah, I have stutter
<Sumica> 00,10that is a sound overflow
<pony_1066> I hear static.
<Cypresswolf> Bedtime for me - Goodnight
<Canadian_Brony> clear now
<Shizuka> 13hm.. any fix?
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Cypresswolf
<Shizuka> 13yeah clear now
<AdamTheDuck> Thanks for streaming Shizuka :3
<Ponyloverforever> Thank you for the stream Shizuka
<PeachStreak> Shizuka: thanks for the stream
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka much better
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Cypresswolf
<Sumica> 00,10too much data and it's fillinf the buffer
<Shizuka> 13hm
<NocturnalBlade> thanks for another awesome stream Shizuka
<J_E_Smith71> Thank ya Shizuka, espically for running Sailor Mouth there
<Queen_Chrysalis> thanks shizuka for teh stream ^^
<DaringDerpy> pony_1066: you can label everything you want "Anarchism". doesn't change anything. in the end only one question is relevant: "who makes the decisions?"
<Silver_Soother> Sumica: Are you going to be streaming next?
<Sumica> 00,10tends to happen if you have alot of things runing or you run low on memory
<Canadian_Brony> Thank you Shizuka for the always awesome stream.
<Shizuka> 13definitely not low on memory, 5 of 8GB free
<Sumica> 00,10I belive NewSuperBronyU is next
<DaringDerpy> thanks Shizuka
<Silver_Soother> Sumica: Okay. :) Thanks.
<Shizuka> 13cpu's about 30% across six cores
<Shizuka> 13pretty standard
<Kencolt> Sailor Mouth. To an old school anime fan, that brings up very very creepy mental images.
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, THANK YOU for the stream. You had me ever since I came back when that Rifftrax of the movie I'd rather see non-riffed was over.
<Phase4> dat hex core
<Sumica> 00,10but mostly it's just VAC is wonky
<Canadian_Brony> hi Phase4
<Phase4> Shizuka, try ffsplit :P
<Shizuka> 13still need to look into that...
<J_E_Smith71> And of course you have the PPG episode like the Spongebob one where they learned to curse
<Sumica> 00,10i recomend after you finish Shizuka you disable the vac cables in sound
<Shizuka> 13will probably do that when back from illinois
<Sumica> 00,10then restart the vac driver
<Canadian_Brony> Anyways, I'm hitting the hay.
<Polydunami> This was preceded by Tiny Toon Adventures, you know.
<Canadian_Brony> G'night everypony!
<sub06905|TARDIS> night Canadian_Brony
<Silver_Soother> Night Canadian_Brony :)
<J_E_Smith71> Polydunami: Oh yeah Foulmouth
<MirrorImage> yep, i agree
<MirrorImage> bed time
<MirrorImage> later folks
<Queen_Chrysalis> bye ccanadian
<Silver_Soother> Aww....
<Polydunami> Yeah, Fowlmouth :D
<J_E_Smith71> And here's the Rocko recycle song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEpG3UsKv54
<DaringDerpy> aww
<AdamTheDuck> Goodngiht Canadian_Brony
<NocturnalBlade> lol dat sleepy rarity ^_^
<sub06905|TARDIS> dat rarity :3
<NocturnalBlade> nite cana
<SirGanjalf> dat sleepyface
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, ROFL
<Silver_Soother> That is one cute marshmellow...
<Queen_Chrysalis> dat dat
<Queen_Chrysalis> lol
<flufflepuff> Rarity just moved up a rank in my book
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: Depends on which form of anarchism you're looking at. You could have individualist anarchy, fairly self-explanatory. But there's also collectivist anarchy, where voluntary associations come together to make these decisions.
<DaringDerpy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hUXsfU14Sc have some music
<Kandarihu> The Sailor Senshi of Planet Mouth
<Kencolt> For the last time-- RARITY IS NOT A MARSHMALLOW. She's a lot closer to fondant.
<J_E_Smith71> And since I got cut off here's the Space Jump Chat Reactions: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-moUvLG2Nes
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: And since you seem to have such a bone with it, for the record, once again, I don't think anarchy is anywhere near feasible at the moment.
<sub06905|TARDIS> :3 http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/171/mallow.png
<DaringDerpy> pony_1066: that's all voodoo theory, most of it was never touched by people with even basic social sciences education.
<MadSurge> Rarity mirrors my own sleepyness :D Good morning Bronystate!
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: I think anarchism is only possible in a completely post-scarcity society.
<DaringDerpy> anarchism is possible whereever central authority fails.
<Kandarihu> pony_1066, anarchy is the complete absence of government. It's impossible to dictate specific varients within that scenario, since it's all chaos.
<DaringDerpy> but it doesn't last
*Sumica wonders if NewSuperBronyU passed out
*sub06905|TARDIS pokes NewSuperBronyU
<Silver_Soother> Sumica: He is building up suspense.
<sub06905|TARDIS> oi u awake
<pony_1066> Kandarihu: No, it's the absence of the state--an absence of rulers. Not the same.
<flufflepuff> <3
<pony_1066> DaringDerpy: Let me rephrase--I think it's only feasible in a post-scarcity society.
*Panda|Sleepies is in bed with SB >///>
<Kandarihu> Well, it's still the absence of whatever determines and maintains the structure of the laws. So whoever is quickest to sieze power becomes the new rulers.
<DaringDerpy> and I think it's not at all. there is no post scarcity in power and influence. there will always be conflicts between humans
<pony_1066> Kandarihu: What power is there to seize in a post-scarcity society?
<Shizuka> 13physical property will always have some amount of scarcity attached
<Shizuka> 13until we figure out how to conjure materials from thin air
<DaringDerpy> If you can destroy the goods distribution channels, you control them. And everyone dependent on them.
<Sumica> 00,10nanotech and relecaters
<MadSurge> Awww I missed Shizustream :(
<Kencolt> One might note tha those who seek power for power's sake-- and such have sadly always existed-- could artificially create scarcity.
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, it was an awesome stream.
<pony_1066> @Shizuka: When I say post-scarcity, I mean COMPLETELY post-scarcity. Land is also a non-issue, so obviously such a society would need to be space-faring. Or be capable of building massive ships.
<NocturnalBlade> ok guys, my eyes are getting heavy so i shall see yall again whe i awaken ^_^ night guys
<NocturnalBlade> and galls
<Polydunami> It's okay, MadSurge. Some of it was bullshit anyway :3
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight NocturnalBlade
<Polydunami> Good night, NocturnalBlade
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, that seems to be the EPA's only real function, to create scarcity.
<Shizuka> 13you can't be completely post-scarcity, there is a finite amount of matter in the universe, and a miserably tiny fraction of it within humanity's reach
<DaringDerpy> good night NocturnalBlade
<twilight_sprinkle> there are however hints to creating matter from energy
<Kencolt> Kandarihu: Being a Republican, I have to admit it certainly seems that way at times. I've no doubt they are well intentioned-- just not well operated.
<pony_1066> @Shizuka: A miserably tiny amount of the universe is an awful lot. Besides, it doesn't need to be infinite, it only needs to be limitless.
*NocturnalBlade hugs AdamTheDuck Polydunami and DaringDerpy :)
<DaringDerpy> :)
<twilight_sprinkle> bye NocturnalBlade
<Phase4> pony_1066, doesn't need to be infinite, just without a finite limit :P
<DaringDerpy> maybe we will see commercial terawatt fusion reactors in our lifetime. cheap energy means cheap everything. but there are still limits. nothing is infinite
<sub06905|TARDIS> Sumica willl you be streaming if NewSuperBronyU doesnt?
<Shizuka> 13see... earth is the only planet we know of that can naturally sustain life, anything else will require either massive construction (supported by limited resources at home) or terraforming (also supported by limited resources at home)
<Silver_Soother> I do believe I am calling it a night now. Sleep well my pony folk, like young Rarity is. ;)
*NocturnalBlade hugs twilight_sprinkle
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, but how was it well-intentioned to declare Co2 a pollutant? Even though plants depend on it to produce our O2?
<pony_1066> twilight_sprinkle: last theory of the creation of the univeRSE I heard was that it actually did emerge from nothing. Has to do with the state of virtual particles and how they simultaneously exist and don't exist.
*NocturnalBlade bows and takes his leave
<sub06905|TARDIS> night Silver_Soother
<MadSurge> OH BOY Retsupururae made a video about Pewdiepie :D
<Polydunami> Kandarihu, Cobalt?
<Kencolt> Kandarihu: They seem to be worried about "excess" CO2. How they define excess is still something of a mystery to me.
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_1066: there are many theories, none have been completely proven
<Shizuka> 13co2 is a pollutant, everyone stop breathing right now
<Sumica> 00,10probably sub06905|TARDIS
*AdamTheDuck holds his breath :<
<DaringDerpy> gaia smiles
<twilight_sprinkle> ok Shizuka but im leaving a note taht it was you who killed me
<Polydunami> I died.
<Shizuka> 13i want to know the metric of how much co2 we put out as part of manufacturing etc compared to the sum total exhalations of every aerobic organism on the planet
<pony_1066> @Shizuka: So? For like the fourth bleeding time now, I do not think it is currently possible, this is all theory. I am anarchist at heart, for now I just settle for libertarianism.
<Sumica> 00,10it's ok Shizuka I have this peice of paper that says it's ok for me to polute a bit
<Kandarihu> Kencolt, a lefty who I met on another IRC network basically told me that deforestation is now the new world-destroying environmental epidemic.
<Shizuka> 13Sumica: give you two buds for it :3
<Sumica> 00,10wooooo
<Sumica> 00,10got to love carbon vouchers
<pony_1066> twilight_sprinkle: It's hard to prove something happened 14 billion years ago. We just need a theory that fits the model.
<Sumica> 00,10especaly how they are on paper.
<Sumica> 00,10it's like ironic
<DaringDerpy> Shizuka: http://www.spin.de/forum/msg-archive/16/2010/02/272882
<twilight_sprinkle> pony_1066: yeh
<DaringDerpy> humans produce 2 billion tons per year, combustion and industry 31 million tons
<Shizuka> 13just a wee bit short :3
<pony_1066> I'm off. See you all later. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> night pony_1066
<DaringDerpy> oh wait...31 billion tons
<Kencolt> well... streamless, and it is getting very late... laters.
<Queen_Chrysalis> bye ken
<Kandarihu> Hoo boy. Cap & Trade. We gotta be on the lookout for that.
<twilight_sprinkle> its 31 million
<twilight_sprinkle> if chrome is translating right
<Shizuka> 13yeah millionen is million
<DaringDerpy> he corrected it one post later
<Shizuka> 13i seem to recall german uses the milliard == billion convention but we didn't really focus on numbers that high
<Kandarihu> Do you know how easy it would be for a human to breathe when in the middle of a thick leafy forest? That's how a tree feels in the middle of human industry.
<DaringDerpy> I just stumbled over a site with people who do yoga do lower their co2 production...
<DaringDerpy> humans are idiots...
<Polydunami> I don't even do yoga :S
<Kandarihu> The solution to excess CO2 is simple. PLANT MORE TREES!
<Polydunami> Besides, what comes in, must go out.
<MadSurge> Shizuka: Italian uses milliards
<Polydunami> Actually, scratch that last comma :S
<Shizuka> 13milliard was brit usage for a while too but slowly moved to billion, as far as i know
<Polydunami> In other words, became obsolete.
<Shizuka> 13i'm relatively small town american so my exposure to world culture is a bit limited >>
<Polydunami> Archaic, even
<Phase4> NewSuperBronyU, Ping
<Phase4> NewSuperBronyU, Ping Ping
<MadSurge> Shizuka: same. Thank god for the Internet :D
<Shizuka> 13true dat
*AdamTheDuck helps Phase4 by licking NewSuperBronyU :P
*Polydunami lives in Vancouver. Lots of culture here :3
<DaringDerpy> german is million, milliarde, billion, billiarde, trillion, trilliarde, etc...
<AdamTheDuck> He's ded, Jim. :|
*Mutterguy live in Christchurch. STILL lots of rubble here.
<DaringDerpy> english million, billion, trillion
<Polydunami> Well, billiard is not obsolete in English.
<Polydunami> It's a heck of a lot of fun, though :3
<Polydunami> *too
<Kandarihu> Polydunami, lol.
*Shizuka 13hasn't played pool in years...
<TheRandomkid321> I just won 10$ off my father..
<Shizuka> 13was vaguely competent at it.. virtual pool with tracer lines does actually help you line things up in reality, assuming you can hit straight >>
<DaringDerpy> Kandarihu: I like excess co2. imagine a green, fertile canada. green antarctica.
<Polydunami> Oh, Yahoo!.
<Mutterguy> I remeber there was Pool game show where contestants had to do elaborate pot shots...
<Mutterguy> it was on the Beeb
<TheRandomkid321> Why are we talking aout pool now?
<Shizuka> 13was french wasn't it? saw a clip of something like that where a guy clears three tables with one shot
<DaringDerpy> because pool
<twilight_sprinkle> milliard=billion in russian too
<Moopy> sup yall
<Mutterguy> no it was definately British
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Moopy
<Moopy> Hoi
<Polydunami> Uhh, hate to break it to you, but the Canada I'm familiar with is quite green.
<DaringDerpy> where it matters, we use x*10^y anyway
<Mutterguy> they may haev copied the french though..
<Moopy> so whats going on here?
<Shizuka> 13might have been british, i might just be confusing multiple clips
<Polydunami> Heck, we have a bog here.
<twilight_sprinkle> DaringDerpy: everyone uses that, its scientific notation
<DaringDerpy> yes
<Kandarihu> Pretty much the perfect imagery to deconstruct the excess CO2 argument would be a group of sentient trees all worried over excess O2, and demanding their own arbitrary population control in order to combat this while the woodland animals look on in disbelief.
<DaringDerpy> Polydunami: except the white parts.
<Shizuka> 13Kandarihu: TREEEEE? I AM NO TREEEEEEEE, I AM AN ENT
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Mutterguy> Kandarihu the funny thing is.... they use O2 at mnight time.
<Polydunami> In other words, not where I live.
<DaringDerpy> they steal out air
<DaringDerpy> our
<Kandarihu> Oh, right. Yeah. Suicidal Ents
<Shizuka> 13Polydunami: probably a good moderating effect from the pacific
<Polydunami> Seriously, I live in Vancouver. We don't usually get a lot of snow.
<twilight_sprinkle> anyway im out, bye
<Mutterguy> *they respire at night
<Polydunami> Moderating?
<Shizuka> 13i'm sure.....whichever province is north of minneota, manitoba i think... is a horrible place in winter
<Kandarihu> Hmm, I never heard about that.
<DaringDerpy> sea climate, Polydunami
<Mutterguy> yep it fucking rocks
<Shizuka> 13considering international falls mn barely gets above freezing like half the year
<Moopy> Hey guess what my mom told me to not to stay up late but im doing it anyway
<Polydunami> Yeah, my grandmother had plenty of stories of her hometown of wintery Winnipeg
<Mutterguy> Few horrible blizzards, tornadoes, storms...
<Polydunami> Yeah, we have an island to the west of us.
<Polydunami> Still, a sea climate.
*Shizuka 13misses illinois climate so much
<Shizuka> 13warm summers that catch the big rain bands that move through all the time, mild winters that don't force you into hibernation for six months
<Kandarihu> Well, I hope you' enjoy the snow, Shizuka. I loved it when I lived in Michigan. I missed it when I lived in Alabama. I only get traces of it in Tennessee.
<Polydunami> Well, it rained. In Vancouver.
<Polydunami> What's new?
<Shizuka> 13moved up here from arizona when i was 10... sure at first it was YAY SNOW AGAIN
<Shizuka> 1312 years later... snow can go melt >>
<Mutterguy> It was white here for 3 whole days... this winter
<Kandarihu> Aw
<Shizuka> 13was cold as hell but last winter was relatively mild snow-wise
<Polydunami> Well, look at us ponies talking about the weather :3
<Mutterguy> sounds like it was just dry then
<Moopy> 3 months of winter coolness and awesome holidays
<Polydunami> Damn, I forgot the words :S
<Shizuka> 13so that's... political ideology > CO2 > millions milliard billions billiard > pool > weather
<Shizuka> 13bronystate!
<Mutterguy> YEAH!!!!
<MadSurge> FUCK YEAH
<Shizuka> 13Moopy: six >>
<Moopy> lol
<Kandarihu> That pretty much summed up this conversation.
<Shizuka> 13when halloween night is routinely a couple degrees above freezing >>
<MadSurge> Shizuka: so wait, are you conservative or liberal? I wasn't looking .__.
<Polydunami> But FREE CANDY!
<Jmo> o.O
<Mutterguy> 'Die hard commie' i think....
<Shizuka> 13i tend to fall on the right side, couple things i'm not thrilled with the more hard line republican stances but that puts me more in the libertarian category than anything
<Moopy> But don't eat to much candy or you will get sick
*Mutterguy is definately me
<Mutterguy> *one
<klobb> cool to hear the Shizuka
<Polydunami> Yeah, I know about savouring each and every bite
<Kandarihu> Yeah. I'm kind of that way too.
*Polydunami wants to try balut some day :3
<MadSurge> Shizuka: as long as you're not racist and an idiot, I don't care, we can meet half-way :)
<Shizuka> 13tbh i generally set my alarm to wake me up to rush, but more because my brain just can't stand to sleep in during OPEN LIIIIINE FRIIIDAAAAAAY
<Shizuka> 13that is when i'm actually using my alarm, otherwise i just follow /r/libertarian and filter out the OMGTWOPARTYNOTFAIR
<Shizuka> 13also "upon sighting a tank" http://i.imgur.com/iMhVO.jpg
<Shizuka> 13coach's face looks more like he sees a tank made of chocolate
<Polydunami> Dang it, now I'm salivating :D
<Shizuka> 13aha, /r/mylittlepony finally delivers http://i.imgur.com/QFPPG.jpg
<Polydunami> So somebody actually jumped from space?
<Shizuka> 13yep, 120k ft, 38km
<Polydunami> I mean, and not burn up as well?
<Shizuka> 13yep
<Shizuka> 13i think it's mid stratosphere, shuttle reentry is a couple dozen more km up i think
<Polydunami> Well, that must have been an alright day for that person.
<J_E_Smith71> Polydunami: Yeah we saw the thing here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-moUvLG2Nes
<Shizuka> 13think it was.. just under 5 minutes of freefall, took ten minutes to land once he popped his chute
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02o3o
<sub06905|TARDIS> suddenly NewSuperBronyU
<Sumica> 00,10clearly they did it wrong Shizuka
<Sumica> 00,10the 2 hours to reach altitude
<Sumica> 00,10next time strap his ass to a rocket
<Shizuka> 13he should have tossed a marshmallow out first then dove to catch it?
<Phase4> Sumica, Ah, the kerbal method
<SirGanjalf> Yeah, you could play entire "Free falling" while he was... free falling:P
<Sumica> 00,10would have been an intersting exparamnt Shizuka
<Phase4> SirGanjalf, it would finish and you'd still be falling
<Sumica> 00,10just seeing waht happend to a marshmellow when he poped the hatch
<Phase4> Shizuka, but how would he eat it, theres a helmet in the way
<SirGanjalf> Phase4: Then i would play Guile's Theme
<Shizuka> 13Phase4: worked for patrick
<Phase4> XD
<Shizuka> 13patrick to spongebob, i like going *kssh* over
<J_E_Smith71> SirGanjalf: Free falling? Is that a song?
<Shizuka> 13yeah it's a thing
<SirGanjalf> eeyuo
<Shizuka> 13van halen's Jump would also have been appropriate
<SirGanjalf> *eeyup
<SirGanjalf> ^
<Shizuka> 13sort of... as i recall it's actually a more morbid song about telling a suicide jumper to... well jump .-.
<J_E_Smith71> Who's the artist?
<Phase4> Shizuka, but its such an upbeat song
<Shizuka> 13van halen
<Shizuka> 13let me double check
<SirGanjalf> J_E_Smith71: Free falling - Tom Petty
<Kandarihu> Oh dear. I must've been out at Wal-Mart when that was going on
<J_E_Smith71> Dang it,, since my video had no sound YouTube's offering me a song suggestion. I'm looking up Free Fall but I don't see that Tom Petty one there
<SirGanjalf> J_E_Smith71: There's also a cover by John Mayer
<J_E_Smith71> Then again that's a 4:30 song and my vid's like 19 minutes so I don't know where to fit it in
<J_E_Smith71> The jump last longer than the song doesn't it?
<Shizuka> 13"David Lee Roth has given various accounts of the meaning behind the lyrics, but he usually says they are about a TV news story he saw where a man was about to kill himself by jumping off a building (Roth thought, "Might as well jump"). He's also said the song is about a stripper."
