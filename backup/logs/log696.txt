<Vivix> Alcohol, electro, and too many people
<Vivix> I never drink
<ShyBetaFemale> oh

<Moopy> yay ponies
<Vivix> Pooniees
<ShyBetaFemale> i usually just stock up on a lot of beer and some shots

<TheRandomkid321> Why do I watch this?
<Vivix> Yeah, but- I don't want to enjoy something because I'm drunk
<Vivix> Like, I go to concerts for music, then leave when they're done
<ShyBetaFemale> being drunk is an amazing lubricant for making new friends
<TheRandomkid321> ShyBetaFemale I take it you're a party animal?
<Vivix> Drunk people can be fun, but I don't like it myself
<ShyBetaFemale> haha
<ShyBetaFemale> maybe just a little ;)

<Lil_B> Malavolent ok, still, I want to give you at least one complete finished sprite :)
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: With a pok?mon Center and a gym and everything.

<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: In fact, the first gym is right there in the starting city
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Sure, just dont overdo it :D

<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: and there's a close patch of grass for catching mons, right? :D
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Yeah, it's nice, but having it start in a town actually worth noting is actually refreshing.
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: What edition of pokemon is that?
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Black and White 2
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: Oh, I'm playing fire red atm.

<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: I've never really liked the later generations. The first two are my personal favourites.
*Jmo sits on Gold_Demona
<Jmo> Woo :>

<Wrek> 05love this song

<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Same here. I regained my interest in the later games after HeartGold and SoulSilver came out though.

<AdamTheDuck> Bye Moopy
<TheRandomkid321> I remember when there where only 150 of you. Well technically 151 if you are counting Mew.
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: It takes everything that was awesome about the original Gold and Silver and improves on it. And adds neat bells and whistles
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Having your pok?mon following you around is an added bonus. :3
*Gold_Demona loves HeartGold and SoulSilver
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: Sounds pretty cool, is it still for gba?
<RainbowPie> Hey everyone :)
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: fifth gen is really good though. The story is actually interesting in that one.
<BoroBrony> hello RainbowPie :)
<TheRandomkid321> They need to release pokemon blue/red on the 3DS. No changes. No improved graphics. zJust the original game I LOVE!
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: Nope. It's for DS. It was released after Diamond Pearl and Platinum.
<AdamTheDuck> Hello RainbowPie~
<RainbowPie> hey BoroBrony dont think ive seen you here before, Nice to meet you :)
*RainbowPie licks AdamTheDuck
<RainbowPie> ha beat you to it AdamTheDuck
<Malavolent> Malavolent: Still, you can play it on PC, can't you?
<AdamTheDuck> :<
<RainbowPie> :D
<Malavolent> I mean Gold_Demona -.-
<AdamTheDuck> Preemptive licks are best licks :$
<BoroBrony> i am not new been here about 4 weeks now i think lol
<Jmo> DEEERRRR
<RainbowPie> hahaha
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: If you can somehow find a working DS emulator, then sure.
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: I've yet to find one that isn't glitchy as hell.
<RainbowPie> There not that hard to get Gold_Demona?
<RainbowPie> I use to have one
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: 3DS shouldn't be so hard to emulate.
*AdamTheDuck gives Jmo a lick as well :P
<TheRandomkid321> Malavolent I would give you my DS. But I'm from australi so it probably won't work where you are.
<Jmo> Ewww
<Gold_Demona> RainbowPie: I keep finding glitchy ones that have compatibility issues. T^T
<Jmo> Licking, how gaay.
*RainbowPie licks Jmo
<BoroBrony> time to make a sasage egg and bacon sandwich and then good to the gym and get rid of it and extra then a run home lol :)
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: I said DS, not 3DS
<TheRandomkid321> Jmo Well yes I am very jolly this evening sir.
<Malavolent> TheRandomkid321: Well then, off to Australia I go. :D
<Jmo> You didn't even lick and I didn't even speak to you.
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm, is JmoxJmo OTP considered gay or masturbation?
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona DeSmuME worked well enough in my opinion
<Malavolent> Gold_Demona: Oops, same thing though.
<RainbowPie> Gold_Demona: http://www.ndsemulator.com/ try this site,
<RainbowPie> get the NO$GBA its the best one
<RainbowPie> or DeSmuMe

<RainbowPie> hehe it works well for me
<Malavolent> I promised to myself I'll watch all the pokemon episodes.
<RainbowPie> just have to get use to the keys
<Lil_B> NO$GBA never really worked that good for me, + I like that you can switch the screens in DeSmuME so they are next to each other instead of ontop
<RainbowPie> Malavolent: I tried that once, Theres so many episodes!
<Gold_Demona> Malavolent: What? Why? The show stopped being good ages ago. D:
<RainbowPie> Gold_Demona: pokemon never gets old!

<Lil_B> I thjink Pokemon lost me after the first Season, I mean every episode was the Same, 1) meet someone 2) Team Rocket 3) TEam Rocket defeated. And every season was the same too, Ash looses the finale
<Gold_Demona> RainbowPie: I watch old episodes for nostalgia. The newer episodes just disappoint me. =/
<Rommulus> I am good BoroBrony =)
<RainbowPie> Gold_Demona: I haven't seen any of the news ones yet
<AdamTheDuck> Rommulus, commerce, like accounting and business management
<TheRandomkid321> Malavolent making a hit Youtube video... Forgot to switch off the lens guard though... But you know us teenage males. Me and my mate always getting into shennagins. The pluses of living in houses that have lots literally touching.
<Gold_Demona> RainbowPie: They're.... let's just say a shell of its former self.
<RainbowPie> Gold_Demona: I like the pokemon movie (the one where it shows the creaters of mutwo) Thats my favorite!
<Jmo> mutwo

<Malavolent> TheRandomkid321: Oh you :D
<Rommulus> AdamTheDuck: Ooooh I see, I guess those types of things can get a little tiring, try find a way to excite yourself again or a way to chill well I guess thats why you are here actually :)
<Gold_Demona> There are several movies, so it's good thing you said Mewtwo, or I wouldn't know which one you're talking about. XD
<RainbowPie> Gold_Demona: haha yeah thats why i mentioned that pokemon :D
<Gold_Demona> And by several I mean like ten.

<BoroBrony> heels yeah RainbowPie
<BoroBrony> oops meant hell lol
<RainbowPie> haha
<Gold_Demona> Not I. Not into horror
<RainbowPie> Gold_Demona: honestly its not that much horror
<BoroBrony> walking dead is so good :)
<RainbowPie> Its more action
<AdamTheDuck> RainbowPie, I'm reading it actually~
<Malavolent> Is it any good?
<RainbowPie> AdamTheDuck, reading it? I didn't know there was a book
<Gold_Demona> zombies isn't horror?
<Gold_Demona> O_o
<AdamTheDuck> RainbowPie, it's a graphic novel
<RainbowPie> Malavolent: Its a really good show
<RainbowPie> Nah its more action than horror
<BoroBrony> i cant wait for season 3
<AdamTheDuck> Comic book pretty much
<RainbowPie> AdamTheDuck, Ah thats cool
<AdamTheDuck> BoroBrony, season 3 is already out from what my friend says
<Gold_Demona> Alright I'll rephrase. Not into zombies unless I'm shooting them with plants.
<RainbowPie> BoroBrony, Season 3 Episode 1 has been released
<BoroBrony> not in england
<Jmo> That awkward moment when you have no friends.
<Wrek> 05+5 if you know this next one
<AdamTheDuck> Ahh ok

<RainbowPie> Gold_Demona, hahah :3
<Gold_Demona> Or gravity guns
<BoroBrony> not for me in england lol
<AdamTheDuck> Jaymoo pls
<TheRandomkid321> Huamn beings are monsters. I hope I don't live to see the first encountrer with extra terrestrial beings for we would surely mistreat the. I just saw a bunch of people in mexico trying to get a rare fish close to shore just to exploit it because it was 6 metres ong.
<Jmo> tl;dr
<Malavolent> Who there Charles Dickens.
<RainbowPie> I can't wait for a zombie apocalypse, It would be heaps fun for the first few weeks then boring then prob go mad with lonelyness

<Malavolent> BoroBrony: How come an egg attacked you?
<BoroBrony> i am frying one for my mate and as it went into the pan it spat at me ouch
<Malavolent> The last revenge.
<Gold_Demona> Had that happen. Not fun
<BoroBrony> all i could here is my mate laughing at me
<Gold_Demona> It's especially bad when I'm making something with oil
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/7924/
<MadSurge> I had pastries try to assault me, but they got eaten :D
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: D: why u so mean
<BoroBrony> i used to cook at a resturante but now i am a GCO lol big change but i still cook for me and my mates and my girlfriend since she cant cook lol
<Gold_Demona> My father in-law likes to assault me with chocolate bars.
<Gold_Demona> And then I eat them
<Jmo> I don't see the issue there.
<MadSurge> ^
<Malavolent> BoroBrony: Please explain GCO to poeple like me.
<Gold_Demona> GCO?
<CrimsonPhoenix> MadSurge, because I got swad http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4589/

<BoroBrony> general construction officer Malavolent when a new development goes up like houses or summit my team and i are the frist in we take down tress then put new ones in we flatten the ground and put in pipes and lines then we move on and let them biuld the houses so i get to mess around with JCBs and stuff lol
<Jmo> That was bad and you should feel bad.
<AdamTheDuck> MadSurge, oh Jesus wat :D
<AdamTheDuck> Dat abomination tag
<Malavolent> BoroBrony: Oh yeah, I get it. How did you get from being a cook to being a GCO? And what is JCB? :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1231/
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: it's a horrible plushie, but it's fun to look at :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> ok let's get serious now
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: It's... terrifying. o_o
*CrimsonPhoenix puts on his kitty top hat
<Gold_Demona> That's worthy of Dolan and Gooby
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: makes for a great example of knockoffs though :D
<XylemTube> TWLIGHT SPARKLE COMMANDS YOU TO READ
<Gold_Demona> lol
<DerpyMuffins> Hai everypony
<DeadpoolDash> wrek, you should play GW2, its fun
<AdamTheDuck> Hello DerpyMuffins
<Rommulus> Hi DerpyMuffins
<BoroBrony> well Malavolent i was bored of being a cook and went to do and apprenticeship then got a job as a GCO and a JCB is diggers and excavators and stuff like that lol and on the side of most of them it says JCB the company that supplies them lol
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: "What retarded changeling morphed into this thing?" :D
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: LOL I don't know. XD
<Wrek> 05DeadpoolDash: nope
<BoroBrony> also Malavolent i love to get dirty lol :D
<Jmo> DeadpoolDash do you talk about any other game.
<DeadpoolDash> TF2
<XylemTube> EXTREME READING
<Jmo> GW2 dis GW2 dat.
<Malavolent> You Americamen and your glorious sounding job positions.
<DeadpoolDash> MW4MERCS
<Malavolent> BoroBrony: Yeah, I didn't need to know that :X
<DeadpoolDash> DCUO
<Jmo> Uh-huh
<Spectrum_Rush> Books
<DeadpoolDash> MWO
<CrimsonPhoenix> BOOKS
<BoroBrony> no not like that Malavolent mud and stuff lol
<DeadpoolDash> FO1,2,3,New Vegas
<DeadpoolDash> Skyrim
<BoroBrony> also i am english from the UK :)
<Malavolent> BoroBrony: You really enjoy that? :D
<DeadpoolDash> ME1,2,3
<DeadpoolDash> I can keep going
<Jmo> Must be a rare occurrence.
<Malavolent> BoroBrony: Oh, let me rephrase my sentence then.
<Malavolent> Oh you British chaps and your fantastic sounding names.
<CriticKitten> Jmo: What's wrong with talking about GW2? :P
<CrimsonPhoenix> Who said villains can't be cute as fuck http://i.imgur.com/5o5Q8.jpg
<DeadpoolDash> everytime I see WoW, I die a little inside
<Jmo> Nothing, it's just that is all I've seen him talk about really.
<Malavolent> CrimsonPhoenix: So kawaii.
<BoroBrony> yeah i love it we go in all clean and come out like a bag of shit but thats how we know we did good
<Wrek> 05DeadpoolDash: why? cant you jstu let others have fun?
<Malavolent> BoroBrony: Or... you know... you can get dirty as pig but still do nothing. :D
<DeadpoolDash> I have seen people destroy their lives with the game
<Jmo> And GW2 can't?
<Malavolent> DeadpoolDash: Well it's not really the game's fault.
<Jmo> Don't try playing that card bro.
<CriticKitten> See, that's the person's fault, not the game
<AdamTheDuck> Here comes another internet arguement... :<
<CrimsonPhoenix> Bronystate general http://i.imgur.com/Doxoy.gif
<CriticKitten> I don't personally like WoW but I'm not about to say no one should play it even if they enjoy it. :P
<Rommulus> Not everyone gets addicted to WoW and if it gives someone enjoyment from playing it then let them play. If they are smart then they know when to stop.
<DeadpoolDash> lack of subscription fee makes it so you dont feel like you need to play all the time
<BoroBrony> Malavolent yeah that works but after sometime it stinks and that sucks lol you should have seen me yesterday had to jump in a pit and shovel some stuff out i went in clean came out as a pile of dirt lol :)
<Jmo> lololol
<Gold_Demona> That flying mount is cool
<Malavolent> BoroBrony: World needs more people who like to get dirty for sake of others :D
<Gold_Demona> I've played a lot of MMOs... Oddly enough WoW is not among them.
<DeadpoolDash> but MMO debates go nowhere fast and just turn into rage and butthurt, so not going to talk about it anymore
<BoroBrony> yep me and my team are so good but mostly we know that someone is going to get a new house are somepeople we get a job when we finish there office its a good feeling :)
<Jmo> Only if you make them like that lel.
<Gold_Demona> I'd love to see a Pok?mon mmo
<CriticKitten> Like I said, I think people should play what they enjoy. If people struggle to manage their time, that's their fault. :p
<Jmo> Oh lord no, not unless the developers are good.
<Wrek> 05enough techno shit
<DeadpoolDash> that would be the ultimate grindfest a Pokemon MMO, GOTTA CATCH'EM ALL!!!
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: I mean like an actual real official one. Like actually endorsed by Nintendo
<Rommulus> Your mount sways to the beat
<BoroBrony> also Malavolent that last one made me blush no one has eversaid that to me or anyone from my team :)
<Jmo> Would have to be good to satisfy todays industry
<DeadpoolDash> japan would eat it up
<Gold_Demona> Pok?mon's a huge cash cow. An MMO would be a huge success.
<AdamTheDuck> lvl 90?
<AdamTheDuck> Is that the lvl cap?
<Rommulus> Yes
<Gold_Demona> EverQuest's level cap is 95. .....Good luck getting there though. :P
<Jmo> Alot of money doesn't mean it would be a success.
<DeadpoolDash> the new expansion raised it I think
<Jmo> :<
<Rommulus> The new expansion made the lvl cap 90
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: I mean a business success.
<Rommulus> the previous lvl cap was 85
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:<
<Jmo> Touche~
*AdamTheDuck drags NewSuperBronyU into the chat
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02O.O
*CriticKitten goes to work. :p
<Gold_Demona> Jmo: Whether it would actually be good would depend on how they make it.
<DeadpoolDash> behold my numbers, they are larger then yours!!!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Have fun CriticKitten :3
*Starflash hugs NewSuperBronyU
<Jmo> Yeah :>
<Vivix> I always liked the sound of MMO, but never found one that suited me
<Jmo> Cause you're picky Vivix.
<Vivix> I am--hysterically so
*NewSuperBronyU huggles Starflash back :3
<Starflash> :3
<DeadpoolDash> I'm cheap
<DeadpoolDash> will never play anything with a subscription fee
<Gold_Demona> Currently the MMOs I play are Star Trek Online and Star Wars: The Old Republic
<Vivix> I often dislike NPC's in MMo's, but having a 100% player controller world is not hteb est idea either, since not everyone likes to rp
<BoroBrony> well i think it is time to get dirty and then come home and watch the england v poland match bye everypony :) :)
<AdamTheDuck> Bye BoroBrony
<Wrek> 05for such an old game
<Wrek> 05dayum is it beautiful
<BoroBrony> bye AdanTheDuck :)
<Vivix> I think, if I started to play mmo's, I would have fun if it were with the right people. That's probably the most important
<Jmo> Which?
<Gold_Demona> Wrek: You think THIS is old? You should look at EverQuest some time
<Jmo> o.O
<Rommulus> I wanted to get into Star Wars: The Old Republic but when I went to try the free trial wouldnt even install.
<DeadpoolDash> NPC's will always be a part of any RPG, MMO or not
<Vivix> RPG yes, MMO no
<Vivix> you can have 100% player controlled environments
<Vivix> without a prewritten story or events, or even quests
<DeadpoolDash> most MMOs are RPG based
<Vivix> where quests are made by players against other players or ..well animals count as npc
<Wrek> 05Vivix: cough planetside 2
<Jmo> lolmost
<Vivix> Maybe, PS2 looked like fun when you guys played it
<Vivix> in a 100% pc controller mmorpg setting you don't need a quest handler either, the player just needs a notebook
*AdamTheDuck never gets to play PS2 with everyone else on BronyState because of timezones ;~;
<DeadpoolDash> would need a new computer for PS2
<Rommulus> PS2 still fun, especially Digimon World 1
<Rommulus> Wait Planetside 2 Derp
<Rommulus> *le facepalm*
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> I think my dream mmorgp is many other's nightmare-
<Rommulus> How so Vivix?
<Gold_Demona> What exactly do you want in an mmo, Vivix?
<Vivix> no npcs or prewritten stories- no money system other than actual money items, no quest system- or trade system- loot is first get first have-
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: ......What? How the hell would that even work?
<Vivix> I think it SOUNDS like fun in my head, but might be a nightmare
<Jmo> Hohohoho
<Vivix> Well, it's like a LARPA, all the story and quests are bascially just "stuff that happens"
<DeadpoolDash> so a giant free for all
<Vivix> yes
<Vivix> factions are created naturally- wars naturally-
<Vivix> money can change currency between factions on their prefered items- creating an economy like EVE
<DeadpoolDash> that would be a complete cluster fuck
<Rommulus> However from a quest you wouldnt get rewards from the player quest giver as no items are traded
<Gold_Demona> So... A big white empty vast land of nothingness...
<Vivix> he throws it at you
<Vivix> or, says "tricked you"
<DeadpoolDash> EVE is the closest you will probably get
<Vivix> yeah-
<SuperBrony64> 11,02SAAAVE MEEE
<Vivix> well, fancy beautiful fantasy map setting
<Vivix> but story is what the players have done since serer day 0
<Vivix> IT's..not a good idea
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Woah, let that one slip out.
<Vivix> but I still want it-
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Off to bed, night all ^-^
<DeadpoolDash> without a narrative most people will get bored
<Vivix> Niight SB
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz
<Rommulus> good night NewSuperBronyU
<Lil_B> NewSuperBronyU I tried to safe you, but they said that you were in another castle
<Vivix> yeah, that's the problem
<Gold_Demona> Very boring very quickly
<Starflash> Gnight NewSuperBronyU|Zzz :)
<Vivix> Yeah~~
<Lil_B> night NewSuperBronyU|Zzz :)
<Vivix> but EVE is the closest as it is now, but I'm not that big a fan of space or..yeah that gameplay
*NewSuperBronyU|Zzz licks Lil_B
<Gold_Demona> Play the game..... There's nothing to do... Leaves game.
<Vivix> EVE has a prewritten story, but all history is what players have done
<DeadpoolDash> the EVE gameplay does kind of suck
<Vivix> well there's things to do, but the things to do are what players want you to do to help them
<Vivix> not a quest marker,
<DeadpoolDash> at least the last time I played it
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: What if you're playing by yourself?
<Vivix> Like, if player group A wants to control the server- they might snap up new players to initiate them
<AdamTheDuck> You know Vivix, your "dream" MMO sounds like DayZ if it had a bigger server limit :P
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Vivix> Maybe~~
<Gold_Demona> A solo player would get REALLY bored really fast in a setting like that
<Lil_B> damn, still have to start working on the Presentation about Mercury and another one about a Project my class did about Genes >.<
<Rommulus> Theres no NPCs though so no Zombies
<Vivix> I think so too Gold- I don't think it's possible withou ..you know, a lot of planning and some sacrifice, like adding some story or quest
<DeadpoolDash> Griefing would be a huge problem in a game like that
<Vivix> yeah, well you don't fight zombies in DayZ anymore
<Vivix> you fight other players
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, I can't just "wander around aimlessly and do whatever". I need quests to keep me occupied. =/
<Vivix> It would be, but griefing would be part of the game
<Rommulus> There are still Zombies that can kill you however
<Vivix> True~
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, imagine a post apocalyptic simulator, that might work~
<DeadpoolDash> so Fallout Online
<Rommulus> Ya true
<Vivix> yeah, I would love a fallou setting with that crazy massive free world roam I described- but- I don't think it would be popular for the reasons you guys said-
<Rommulus> Fallout Online with no NPC's
<Vivix> Kinda like how- people form clicks, right? Based on woh they like, where they are,
<Vivix> Factions would be formed- but it would be hard for new players to enter-
<Rommulus> The DayZ idea but - zombies is a good idea
<Vivix> but that might create a new faction-
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Sounds like guilds
<DeadpoolDash> fallout has huge backstory that could easily be filled by players without a narrative
<Vivix> Yeah, but without programming support
<DeadpoolDash> people would naturally band together to survive in the wastes
<Gold_Demona> I don't really see how that would work, given human nature. I see that only ending in a lot of anarchy and chaos and probably a lot of hate.
<Rommulus> If you made main servers for DayZ, added in more of a apocalyptic setting, terrain changing what not and natural disasters with a larger player base it could work.
<Vivix> It would be, but wouldn't someone form to fight that chaos?
<Vivix> like a group of friends who hate griefers-
<DeadpoolDash> the brotherhood of steel would form
<Vivix> I dunno- it would probably fail horribly, but- I think it could work out if you gave the players absolute control, as a social experiment
<Gold_Demona> Like I said. A lot of hate.
*AdamTheDuck imagines a Pony faction in said setting :D
<Vivix> Hehe
<Gold_Demona> Giving the players absolute control of the game is asking for complete chaos.
<Vivix> It iis
<Vivix> but that chaos might be interesting-
<Rommulus> The Pony Faction. Pure. Win.
<Wrek> 05fuck fallout and elder scrolls MMOs
<Gold_Demona> Not my thing. T^T
<Wrek> 05jsut give me coop
<Vivix> ^
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, hehe, ikr :D
<Gold_Demona> There's gonna be an Elder Scrolls mmo
<DeadpoolDash> you would still need enemy AI creatures like Deathclaws and shit to wonder around the wastes or else it wouldnt be Fallout
<Rommulus> I enjoyed Skyrim however I agree.
<Vivix> True, you would need animals and creatures
<Jmo> Yeah and I can see that failing.
<Rommulus> I stick by the Dayz idea
<DeadpoolDash> there are co-op mods for the fallout games
<Vivix> I would love to set up such an mmo as an experiment, but I--yeah- I don't think it would succeed. I'm just a fan fo that maximum freedom you get in some RP settings
<AdamTheDuck> DeadpoolDash, nah those mods died
<Vivix> Only natively for BoS
<Rommulus> DayZ - zombies with Natural disasters and larger playerbase
<Gold_Demona> Maybe it's because I don't like PvP and I don't interact much (if at all) with other players, but that idea really doesn't seem appealing to me.
<Vivix> Yeah, I don't think it would be something everyone would enjoy
<Vivix> But it's eh, the thing that often bugged me in MMO's, is how quests were global. If I completed a quest, it wasn't completed
<Vivix> some mmo's apparently have global quests that if one complete it is copmelted for ever- but yeah
<DeadpoolDash> PvP in an MMO for me is about choice, unless that is what the MMO is based around
<Gold_Demona> global... what?
<Gold_Demona> I've never heard of quests like that
<Vivix> I don't know the real names-
<Vivix> but one quest is for all players, and every player can complete it at any time
<Vivix> even if a nother player has already completed it
<Gold_Demona> The only quests I get are ones I can actually finish and get stuff from.
<HavokOC> Hai ^.^
<Rommulus> Do you mean like quests such as get get this man 5 wolf meat and when you complete the quest you see 5 other people trying to get the guy 5 wolf meat aswell
<DeadpoolDash> well you have event progression and regression in a game no one wants me to take about
<DeadpoolDash> talk
<Vivix> Rommulus, yeah, and that kinda irked me when I was a kid and tried MMO's
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Oh! Those things! I think they're called Progression Quests.
<Vivix> Yyeah
<Gold_Demona> At least that's what they're called on the Progression servers in Everquest
<Vivix> now I think I heard someone talk about--events happening on big MMO's, like--wars--and htat sounded cool
<Gold_Demona> Everquest has special servers for people who like to do them
<Vivix> Aah
<DeadpoolDash> ...
<Vivix> What was that..first huge MMO? A..a something
<Gold_Demona> I've never actually done progression quests because... I've only known that to exist in Everquest
<Vivix> Mm, I think they're pretty common, or maybe progression quests are a bit more specific
<Gold_Demona> And I only played on the one regular server, so the Progression quests were never a concern for me.
<Gold_Demona> I've played several MMOs and I've only seen them in Everquest
<Vivix> but yeah- I think I'd enjoy MMO with people, social and pretty worlds, but that crazy mmo idea has been in my head for ages
<Vivix> Mm then progression is more specific-
<Wrek> 05world boss time~
<Vivix> I mean eh, quests, once you complete them they are not complete for everyone
<Rommulus> World bosses <3
<DeadpoolDash> well progression/regression events happen on a constant basis in various zones depending on the action of players in the event area in a certain game
<Vivix> mmm, that's what I like, events that change the world forever in games
<Gold_Demona> DeadpoolDash: Yeah, I've only seen that in EverQuest. What other game does that?
<Gold_Demona> All other games I play, the progression happens by server patches and expansions
<ShyBetaFemale> well it took me a few minutes but i managed to cut a splinter out of my foot, what are you guys up to?
<DeadpoolDash> ...the one I always talk about, but the changes go back and forth
<Gold_Demona> Not the players' ability to complete quests
<Vivix> Oh! yes, I mistook progression quests for level progression
<Rommulus> Actually Vivix, I just realised something my friends were talking about
<Rommulus> Might be your style
<Vivix> Hm?
<Gold_Demona> And in Everquest, the progression quests only happen on the one server. All the other servers are up to date based on patches and expansions.
<Rommulus> It is yet to be released but it is called Vampire of the Masquerade, it is going to be a MMO set in modern day, the heirachy of vampires is all players, there is a prince of every city.
<Rommulus> The player that is the prince can only be overthrown by being killed
<Rommulus> if a character dies
<Rommulus> it will be perma death
<Gold_Demona> Ugh, I hate games like that. T^T
<DeadpoolDash> ewww perma death
<Vivix> I love permadeath for some reason-
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<Rommulus> That might be more your style when it comes out
<Vivix> Might be, yeah-
<Gold_Demona> It's one of the reasons I never made it through Fire Emblem. Incessently restarting my game to make sure NOBODY FREAKING DIES!!!
<Rommulus> My friends and I are going to be making a Sabat group ( pritty much Terrorists of the Vampire world) and we are going to try overthrow the Masquerade (the Government) in a city.
<Vivix> Aah
<Rommulus> Interesting this is they actually give you benefits for being in the Masquerade (government) instead of the Sabat so the players dont all go terrorists
<Vivix> hm, it sounds kinda fun
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> I think my game taste is a bit eccentric- but not all the time
<AdamTheDuck> There's no shame in being deviant :P
<Vivix> Like, I really wanted a war game that was abot being a woman with child in London
<Vivix> 1943 ish
<Vivix> and just..surviving
<Vivix> no battle
<Vivix> Maybe end it with a bombing-
<AdamTheDuck> .-.
<Gold_Demona> wut
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah just throw a bomb in there for fun
<Vivix> A --story game
<Vivix> Nono not that eh
<Vivix> the london blitz
<Rommulus> A rpg
<AdamTheDuck> Oh right
<AdamTheDuck> Reminds me of a beautiful song
<Vivix> It could be fun- semi-linear game, almost dear esther ish
<AdamTheDuck> Although I can't link because there's a stream :/
<Vivix> but more interactive with several endings
<Vivix> Aah
<Wrek> 05won the tier gloves
<Wrek> 05go me!
<naturesfury> gratz
<MadSurge> Time for minestrone, bbl :)
<Gold_Demona> Yay!
<AdamTheDuck> Hey Wrek, what does one do once they get full tier armour?
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: How would a game like that end tho?
<Rommulus> Here you go Vivix http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/62202/Vampire-The-Masquerade-MMO-Details-Emerge
<Vivix> Well, basically, with the london blitz, maybe an outro with whether or not your child survived, and the future based on your choices
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: That might actually be interesting. Your success would be based more on your intellect than your ability to fight.
<DeadpoolDash> they has all the gearz of course and are the 1337
<Vivix> Yeah, I think it could be fun, interesting
<Jmo> MASH THE B BUTTON DAMN YOU
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Wrek> 05tough bastard
<naturesfury> wish i could help ya
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: And you could end up in a variety of scenarios based on where you go and what you do.
<Vivix> Yeaah, almost like..almost like a modern version of interactive novellas-
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: The only real violence would be if you get caught and die. :P
<Vivix> Yeaa
<Gold_Demona> interactive novellas? Never heard of 'em. O_o
<Vivix> like CYOAs
<Gold_Demona> What now?
<Vivix> eh Choose your own adventure
<Gold_Demona> Ooh!
<Gold_Demona> Those things
<Gold_Demona> That'd be pretty cool, actually
<DeadpoolDash> turn to page 33 not to die
<Vivix> yeah- hehe I'd play it
<Gold_Demona> Me too
<Gold_Demona> I'm a dork for things like that
<Vivix> Hehe, me too, I've been addicted to eh Choice of games lately
<Gold_Demona> That sort of storytelling can apply to any story though, not just a woman trying to survive the blitz.
<Vivix> yeah, it could--open up for a lot of really cool story based games
<Vivix> maybe not 10 hours of gameplay, but- still
<Gold_Demona> Kinda like those point and click adventure games, but more linear.
<Vivix> Yeah
<Gold_Demona> Less complicated
<Vivix> Ah, I wish I had a indie game studio at my hands
<XAX> >mfw crystal pony r34 while looking for pinkie pie vector
<XAX> ._.
<Gold_Demona> I think the best way to describe such a game is like a "choose your own adventure movie".
<AdamTheDuck> .-.
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome to the internet XAX
<Vivix> Yeaah
<Gold_Demona> XAX: wut
<Jmo> Like I'm gonna believe you were looking for a pinkie pie vector.
<Jmo> Liar kiwi.
<Gold_Demona> Cuz that's basically what it is. You make a choice, and then you watch a cut scene. And then you're met with another set of decisions.
<XAX> Jmo: srs
<Jmo> LIAR.
<XAX> no
<XAX> u
<Jmo> nou
<Gold_Demona> gais dnt fite D:
<Vivix> Yeah, depending on how interactive you want it- and- yeah
<XAX> Nein du
<Vivix> I think the closest we have might actually be Walking dead game, veery CYOA ish
<Jmo> Racist.
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I'd buy something like that. =)
<XAX> k
<Gold_Demona> I'm easily amused, so that'd keep me occupied for hours
<Vivix> Me too~~ I'll throw money at devs
<Jmo> wub u long tim kiwi
<Gold_Demona> dat dragon
<XAX> wub u long time in return jaymo
<Jmo> hah ur gay
<XAX> you would.
<AdamTheDuck> Dat kick
*AdamTheDuck slowclaps for Jmo
<Jmo> orly
<Gold_Demona> Jmo stahp :<
<Pink3> Too Bad i lost my world of warcraft account
<Gold_Demona> I got banned from WoW, and I never even owned it.
<AdamTheDuck> ^ lolwut
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: Some asshole hacked my Blizzard account and used it to sell money on WoW. :P
<Gold_Demona> Only reason I have a Blizzard account is because I have StarCraft 2
<XAX> Gold_Demona: Stahp came from a reference to Jersey Shore ಠ_ಠ
<AdamTheDuck> .-.
<Wrek> 05dunno why
<Wrek> 05but i really like this song
<Gold_Demona> XAX: I wouldn't know. I never watched Jersey Shore.
<AdamTheDuck> I thought it just sounded silleh, and Jmo is always silleh
<Vivix> I thought it was from MSPaint adventures
*Vivix shrugs
<Gold_Demona> XAX: I just think "stahp" is funny. :P
<AdamTheDuck> ^
<XAX> Gold_Demona: I read the know your meme page. Yeah, it is pretty funny, but now I think of jersey shore every time I hear it :<
<Gold_Demona> That sucks. :<
<Pink3> :P
<dj-pon-3> what is up everypon3?
<Vivix> Jersey Shore..ruining things since ddmmyy
<Gold_Demona> Unless you're American, then it's mmddyy
<Vivix> yyes
<Gold_Demona> :P
*Vivix shify eyes
<Gold_Demona> >_>
<Vivix> Those two always confuse me, release dates on the internet is terrifying unless one of them is over 12
<Vivix> are*
<Gold_Demona> You were right the first time
<Gold_Demona> is
<Gold_Demona> One is
<Vivix> Oh, but the release dates on the internet is terrifying?
<dj-pon-3> what is up everypon3?
<Vivix> I'm trying to nail is are, they sometimes escape me
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Oh that. lol XD
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: I thought you were talking about the other is
<Vivix> ah yes hehe
<Gold_Demona> You are correct sir
*Vivix does a little jig
<Gold_Demona> dates are terrifying
<Vivix> that and deadlines
<Vivix> - /appointments
<Gold_Demona> Yeah I get confused when I see a date posted in the rest of the world's date format. :P
<Gold_Demona> My brain goes "Date first asdofehwfiupahfelwhfud-- Does not compute!"
<Gold_Demona> My feeble American brain D:
<Vivix> especially if you're not sure where that person is from, and its something like 02/09/12
<Gold_Demona> Yesh. Not sure if February 9th or September 2nd...
<Vivix> yee
<Gold_Demona> See, that's why we put month first, cuz that's how we say it out loud.
<Gold_Demona> February 9th = 02/09
<Vivix> Yeah, but in Norwegian we say Andre September, which is 02 09
<Gold_Demona> Makes sense
<Vivix> I guess that's why they're different-
<Gold_Demona> I think most people say it that way
<Gold_Demona> The 2nd of Septamber = 02/09
<Gold_Demona> September*
<Vivix> Hm, on a world basis yeah, maybe- I think Japan has same as USA?
<Gold_Demona> I have no idea
<Vivix> I used to know that one, from buying tons of cd's from japan
<Gold_Demona> heh
<Vivix> now I can't remember-
<Phase4> chat is full of Gold_Demona and Vivix
<Vivix> Hiiiiii~~~phaaaseeee
<Gold_Demona> ohai Phase4 :D
<AdamTheDuck> .-.
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, chat is dead otherwise. XD
<Vivix> Yeaah~
*AdamTheDuck plays ded
<Gold_Demona> Just me and Vivix yakkin' away
*Vivix holds the duck
*AdamTheDuck licks Vivix
*Vivix prepares duck roast
*Gold_Demona defibrillates AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> :<
*Gold_Demona makes roast duck as a result
<Vivix> Woops
<Gold_Demona> Um...
<Vivix> Yeaahh- maybe the dogs can get him
*Gold_Demona squeezes an orange over the duck
<Gold_Demona> Duck L'orange anypony? :D
<Vivix> orange? Hm Never tried that
<Gold_Demona> I've never had duck, so I have no idea what I'm doing. :P
<Vivix> Hehe
<Vivix> I've only had it in vietnamese and thaifood
<Gold_Demona> I only assume that's how Duck L'orange is made
<Vivix> I'd assume so-
<Gold_Demona> cook the duck in orange juice
<Vivix> Adam! You must know, you are the duck
<Gold_Demona> So he'd know how to cook a duck? lol XD
<Vivix> Ah yeah, cannibalism or..something
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: mmm, I taste delicious!
<AdamTheDuck> Did I ever tell why I put my name as a duck?
<MadSurge> Nope
<Phase4> AdamTheDuck, nope
<Vivix> No, story tiime
<MadSurge> ^
<Gold_Demona> Do tell
<AdamTheDuck> Well, it was a documentary at school
<AdamTheDuck> Of the Arctic
*Gold_Demona gathers with everyone to hear AdamTheDuck's story
<AdamTheDuck> Was pretty boring actually, until the food chain part
<AdamTheDuck> And there was this one duck
<AdamTheDuck> Bottom feeder
<Vivix> D=...I think I know that documentary
<AdamTheDuck> Because it couldn't hunt, it ended up scavenging seal flesh from other hunted seal
<AdamTheDuck> Cannibal duck is best duck <3
<AdamTheDuck> Well not really cannibal
<Vivix> I think I saw that too- or heard of that duck, creepy
<AdamTheDuck> but still ate flesh
<Gold_Demona> But... If the duck is eating seal, how is it a cannibal? O_o
<Vivix> Carniduck
<MadSurge> ^
<Gold_Demona> Ducks are omnivores aren't they?
<Vivix> Last day of college we sat around watching nature documentaries in the basement
<AdamTheDuck> That and this is my steam display picture http://fav.me/d1w4b5f
<Vivix> I think so
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: I think so
<Vivix> Oh that image
<Gold_Demona> You kill Hello Kitty! D:
<AdamTheDuck> So I felt obliged to use duck in my name :$
<Vivix> POor kitty
<Gold_Demona> heh
<MadSurge> Badass scavenger duck is badass
<Vivix> Birds are fun
<Vivix> And sometimes, cute
<Rommulus> Hey all, can you recommend me a band/some music to listen to?
<AdamTheDuck> Rommulus, what type?
<MadSurge> Tbh I think birds are my least fav kind of animals :/
<Rommulus> Rock or something loud. Not screamo however.
<AdamTheDuck> Rommulus, maybe some post rock/ambiance perhaps?
<Gold_Demona> If I had to pick a least favorite kind of animal, it'd be bugs. :<
<dj-pon-3> what is up everypon3?!
<Rommulus> I am in one of those moods that I just want to destroy my eardrumbs.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai dj-pon-3
<Gold_Demona> I don't hate all bugs, but a lot of them are just bleh, and I'd rather not ahve any in my house
<dj-pon-3> hello AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> Rommulus, damn, was about to suggest something relaxing >.>
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: but bugs are all kinds of fun :( they can do all sorts of stuff
<Gold_Demona> Rommulus: Rammstein
<Rommulus> I am usually all about Beethoven and Motzart but today not so much
<Vivix> Rommulus listen to eh..2morromorroland
<Rommulus> I will be writing the bands down so suggest a bunch if you like
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: They gross up my house
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: I want them OUT
<Vivix> Lightning Bolt is eardrum destroyers- I guess, not big fan, but yeah.
<Vivix> I'm scared of bugs, most of them, but some- like moth Saturn posted last ngiht, was pretty adorable
<ShyBetaFemale> i think tarantulas are cute
<Gold_Demona> I like pretty bugs. I mostly don't like the creepy bugs that feed on things in your house.
<Vivix> Grizzly Bear - Caribou - Sparklehorse - Animal Collective - Steel pole bath tub - pavement | all bands I've listened to a lot lately
<Gold_Demona> Cuz that means they move into your house... And you have to kill them...
<Vivix> Totally- spiders freak me out the most
<ShyBetaFemale> aw
<ShyBetaFemale> spiders are so nice though
<Vivix> ;__;
<Vivix> They do good, but I can't look at them
<Gold_Demona> Spiders bite. I don't like biting bugs
<ShyBetaFemale> spiders bite as a last resort
<Gold_Demona> Spiders are welcome OUTSIDE my house
<ShyBetaFemale> they aren't out there to kill you
<Vivix> They bite me in my sleep
<Gold_Demona> They can eat bugs outside my house
<Vivix> a loooot
<ShyBetaFemale> i mean we are like giants to them, it's not a battle they want to fight dude
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: don't get me wrong, I don't like bugs crawling on me, but they're cute to watch!
<Gold_Demona> ShyBetaFemale: That doesn't make them any less dangerous
<ShyBetaFemale> they aren't dangerous
<Vivix> I think of the great species, I like Avian, Cervine, Equine and Feline the best
<Vivix> and whatever foxes are..Vulpine?
<ShyBetaFemale> they're dangerous if you try to make them bite you
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: birds instead are dumb, aggressive and they poo all over the place :(
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, I think so too. But outside. I don't want them in my house
<Gold_Demona> Bugs I mean
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Yesh Vulpine
<Vivix> Vulpines are cuuute
<Gold_Demona> I like Corvines. :3
<Gold_Demona> Corvines are shmart
<ShyBetaFemale> i like canines :D
<Vivix> I don't want a bird as pet, but I think they're beautiful
<Vivix> not big on canines- but cute too
<ShyBetaFemale> and lions
<Gold_Demona> Same here Vivix
<ShyBetaFemale> lions are awesome
<Vivix> Corvines? *googles
<Gold_Demona> Cats in general are awesome
<ShyBetaFemale> i'm a dog person
<Gold_Demona> Dogs are awesome too
<Vivix> Oh a type of fish?
<ShyBetaFemale> cats are fine but you don't really put time into training them and teaching them
<Gold_Demona> I love both cats and dogs equally.
<Gold_Demona> But I don't want to own a dog cuz they're too much work
<Vivix> I have both cats and dogs, but I must say I prefer cats-
<Vivix> And neglected dogs can be hard to handle, cats tend to handle themselves when you're too busy
<Gold_Demona> Exactly
<Vivix> oh Corvine Crow?
<Gold_Demona> Cats aren't pack animals, so it doesn't hurt their feelings if you don't pay attention to them
<Gold_Demona> Vivix: Yes, Corvines are the crow family
<ShyBetaFemale> neglected dogs aren't hard to handle unless you're a sloppy owner, the first dog i grew up with was a doberman we got from a shelter in africa
<Gold_Demona> I especially like Ravens
<Vivix> Yeah, dogs can feel..rejected I suppose? If they're neglected, and can then try to become alpha--it can be a weird
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Dog Whisperer docet :D
<Vivix> yeaah, crows are beautiful-
<ShyBetaFemale> you don't get a dog if you plan on neglecting it
<ShyBetaFemale> you get a cat for that
<Vivix> Yeah, so when I move out on my own, I don't plan to have a dog
<Gold_Demona> Exactly, but I don't neglect my cats
<Gold_Demona> I sometimes ignore them, but neglected they are not
<ShyBetaFemale> cats are fine with neglect they're more territorial than personal anyways
<Vivix> Me neither- they seem happy enough
<Vivix> One of our cat wont let us pet him, but he likes being in the same room as us, and seems most happy when he can sleep knowing we are there
<Gold_Demona> My cats generally hang out wherever I am in the house
<MadSurge> Vivix: agreed :3 to be honest I really hate only commonbirds like pigeons and seagulls
<Vivix> Ahh, pigeons and such can be a bit creepy- especialyl how forceful they are
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Yeah, those bastards suck
<MadSurge> Crows are smart birds:)
<Gold_Demona> Especially ravens
<Vivix> Crows are crazy smart- like that traffic trick
<Gold_Demona> Ravens know how human fishing techniques work!
<Vivix> And what's that bird that creates tools to lure out insects from wood?
<MadSurge> And magpies are self aware :$
<MadSurge> Vivix: and who uses human traffic to break nuts?
<Gold_Demona> Blue Jays are crows too, but I don't hear very much about their intelligence. :P
<Vivix> I think it's a type of raven- or croow-
<Vivix> They drop them on crosswalks, so they can get them when the lights turn green
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: Mordecai is the exception :D
<DeadpoolDash> well time for sleep
<MadSurge> Night DeadpoolDash!
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Is that the one from Regular Show?
<Vivix> night DeadpoolDash
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight DeadpoolDash
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: yeah :D never watched it though
<Gold_Demona> MadSurge: Me neither
<Vivix> Regular Show is fun , actually
<Gold_Demona> I don't have cable, so I can't watch it
<MadSurge> Vivix: heard so
<DeadpoolDash|Zzz> nite everypony
<Vivix> Ah, I don't have cable either, but it goes on parabol here
<Vivix> eh..sattelite
<Gold_Demona> I consider them the same thing. :P
<Vivix> Ahh
<DeadpoolDash|Zzz> watchcartoonsonline.com has it
<Vivix> I think Netflix and such too, not sure
<Gold_Demona> It's an outside service that's beyond the boundries of broadcast television.
<Vivix> ah yeah
<Vivix> Broadcast is digitalized here
<Gold_Demona> Here too
<Vivix> so it's basically all--subscription
<Gold_Demona> Not here
<Gold_Demona> Broadcast is free.
<Vivix> I miss non digital broadcast, it was all free and..cool
*Vivix misses that
<Saturn> 08,01hi all
<Vivix> I think some of it is technically free, but you have to buy a riksTV package, and thats subscription and license fee
<Gold_Demona> I don't understand charging for channels your TV antenna can pick up...
<SirGanjalf> I haven't seen a magpie in my neighborhood from sime time.
<Vivix> Yeah, its--odd
<Rommulus> Hi Saturn
<Vivix> Hiya saturn
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Saturn

<Gold_Demona> Panda, you stole Jmo's trout again!
<JunkerKun> Well, Pikachu's bowel wasn't so yummi X)
<Panda|Sketching> Why does everyone say that D:
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: oh, i didnt know puyo puyo was a puzzly game, i only know of a puyo puyo dj who makes very weird techno remixes lol
<Panda|Sketching> dis trout is mine!
<Gold_Demona> Jmo's the one who's always slapping people with large trouts. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: his name makes a little more sense to me now lol
<Calcos323> Soviet Pones
<twilight_sprinkle> what if... Panda is jaymoo :O
<Moopy> i know this song
<Gold_Demona> :O
<Moopy> i played it a long time ago
<JunkerKun> Ouch... RA3...
<Panda|Sketching> Gold_Demona ive been slapping people before it was cool. Just not in mane chat :3
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: it's kinda like a cross between Dr Mario and Puzzle Fighter :D
<Gold_Demona> Panda: heh
<killerpony7733> Fuck yeah RA2 or RA3
<killerpony7733> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: ah k lol
<Gold_Demona> Yeah I did hear that it was an actual command in some client.
<twilight_sprinkle> hipster panda
<Gold_Demona> like /trout or something
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: trout? O_o
<Panda|Sketching> Gold_Demona eeyup. for me its just rightclickname>slap
*Panda|Sketching slaps JunkerKun around a bit with a large trout
<Gold_Demona> heh
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: Who would make a command like this?
<JunkerKun> Panda|Sketching: HEY! Stop it!
<Panda|Sketching> JunkerKun ME!
<Gold_Demona> JunkerKun: Whoever thought it was funny to slap people with large trouts. :D
<Gold_Demona> And they're right
<Panda|Sketching> JunkerKun D: not till you gimme yo art talent!
<JunkerKun> Panda|Sketching: O_O
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, my client doesn't give me the slap option if I right-click. :P
<JunkerKun> Oooookay... just... just don't saw my arms off, okay?
<Panda|Sketching> D:
<Panda|Sketching> why would I do that?
<Gold_Demona> So if I slap people with trouts, I have to write the whole thing out, and I don't quite have it memorized. XD
<JunkerKun> Panda|Sketching: Well, I've heard that it is all in hands!
<Panda|Sketching> Gold_Demona, repeat after me :3 /me slaps ___________ around a bit with a large trout
<JunkerKun> Panda|Sketching: Don't like the term "talent" though
<Gold_Demona> Actually, You get better results in your art if you use your whole arm to draw and not just your hand.
<JunkerKun> Panda|Sketching: In my book it is all about training
<Panda|Sketching> JunkerKun oh my~ you have talented hands? ;)
<Panda|Sketching> JKJKJK!
<Gold_Demona> JunkerKun: I'm of the opinion it's a combination of talent and skill.
<Gold_Demona> The best artists have both
<Panda|Sketching> JunkerKun yeah Gold_Demona yelled at me cuz i got it wrong /)_(\
<JunkerKun> Gold_Demona: Nah. For me talent itself is a combination of skill and will
<Gold_Demona> I have talent but not a whole lot of skill.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Wait whats this about slapping?
<Panda|Sketching> I have LOTS of will power!
<Panda|Sketching> does that count?
<Gold_Demona> JunkerKun: Talent is something you just have innately. You develop the skill through training.
*ASoftFluffyThing slaps BladedWings|HW around a bit with a large trout
<JunkerKun> Panda|Sketching: Sure. I've been training for 6 or 7 years and still don't draw as good as I want
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh my god there actually is a command for slapping with a large trout
*JunkerKun takes trout from ASoftFluffyThing
<Panda|Sketching> JunkerKun 18 years .___. and i didnt get tolerable till i started drawing ponies.
<ASoftFluffyThing> JunkerKun, you took my right click!
<JunkerKun> ASoftFluffyThing: Who? Me? O_O
*BladedWings|HW looks up from homework " ASoftFluffyThing , what was that for?" :(
<JunkerKun> ASoftFluffyThing: Wasn't me! <_<

<Panda|Sketching> Everyone press ctrl V then enter!
<JunkerKun> Panda|Sketching: Well, I wouldn't even start drawing until I got into CDRR stuff

<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Ryunosuke> err i take it
<Kimori> Turned on the computer this morning to get a notification of a hard drive failure :/
<Cades> hey
<Stormy> D:
<Wrek> 05qat
<Blako> oh, and could you save some data?
<Wrek> 05w*
<Kimori> Im still on the computer
<Kimori> using it right now :P
<Calcos323> Stop killing yourself
<Blako> than do backups!
<Kimori> Everything is backed up
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<Stormy> My old computer used to always have BSoDs
<Calcos323> lawl
<Blako> ok
<Ryunosuke> wrek
<Ryunosuke> what are you doing? :p
<Stormy> everything was always fine after restarting
<Ryunosuke> sniper =/= front line grunts :)
<Wrek> 05i have the shotgun
<Wrek> 05so im infiltrating
<Ryunosuke> ooo going the stealth shotgun
<Wrek> 05getting nice 1shot kills
<Ryunosuke> i need moneys to get the ar or shots
<Kimori> Is anyone here good in knowing the details of a hard drive?
<Ryunosuke> or anything better than a pistol :p
<Stormy> what do you mean by details?
<Ryunosuke> kissu kissu
<Cades> nope
<Stormy> by the way Spyrorocks[Laptop]: I'm going to Lacrosse this weekend so I can probably pick up that Rainbow Dash if you still want it
<Kimori> http://imageshack.us/a/img51/7339/harddrivechart.png
<Kimori> This
<Kimori> This is what I checked when I was getting the failure message
<Stormy> oh. D:
<Ryunosuke> also,i can never drive the quad in fps I suck at it :p
<Kimori> What does the Reallocated Sector Count supposed to do?
<Stormy> sorry, no idea what that means
<Kimori> oh ok
*Stormy googles
<Kimori> I figured id ask because I know some of you know a lot about computers :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy yes please ! :)
<Stormy> I pretty much only know the basics of hardware stuff. :(
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I will paypal you monies
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> reallocated sectors is a hard drive trying to repair itself
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> marking a sector as "bad" because it cannot be read, and redirecting it to a good sector.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> too many reallocated sectors means you have a bad disk.
<Kimori> Is there a way to predict how much time the hard drive has?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> nop
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> nope
<Kimori> So it could run for another year....right?
<Kimori> or am I dreaming? :P
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/a132bdef131d13b9a1ae0bff805f8f71.jpg best airplane :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> it could
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> reallocated sectors are kind of normal.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> its only a problem if you see that number constantly increasing.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> all hard drives have small maufacturing defects
<Kimori> ill keep an eye on it from now on
<VioletGreySha> Wrek: check that shazbot: http://greyshaa.deviantart.com/#/d5i69g9 it fits the luna one you made a while ago :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> reboot your pc a few times and check the count
<Wrek> 05hehe
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> if it keeps going up, failure is probably close.
<MadSurge> VioletGreySha! :)
<VioletGreySha> hay MadSurge :P
<MaxTheBrony> Heya again :)
<Dken2021> hai MadSurge
<MadSurge> :P
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, MaxTheBrony. :)
<Wrek> 05stroking mah scruff <3
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> If you have many reallocated sectors, it is statitstically probable that your drive will fail sooner than one without.
<Wrek> 05such an ego booster a beard is
<BladedWings> hi MaxTheBrony and VioletGreySha
<MaxTheBrony> O.o?
<Wrek> 05even if its jsut scruff :P
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<killerpony7733> Argh stupid planetside 2
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> The drive isn't making a "clicking" noise is it?
<MaxTheBrony> I know that feeling :p Thought i cant even call my thing on my chin scruff
<Kimori> nope it isnt
<Kimori> its pretty quiet, I didnt notice any change
<Kimori> I did restart it too and the number hasnt changed
<Gold_Demona> Heffalumps and Woosels?
<Invi> oh that song...
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/c7bd31428f8945b123d3082a911551f9.png MANLYPIE
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> your probably fine.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> clicking noises on hard drives means impending doom.
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: .........
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Just keep backups, like you should anyways even if your drive is 100% perfect.
<Kimori> Well at least everythings backed up
<Kimori> yeah
<Gold_Demona> This song fits so well with the rest of the playlist. Eeyup! Sure does. XD
<MadSurge> ^
<MaxTheBrony> :P What is this song from?
<MaxTheBrony> where*
<MaxTheBrony> Whiney puh?
<Chrysalis> wrek, can i link this vid for its sheer stupidity?
<Gold_Demona> Whinnie the Pooh
<MaxTheBrony> ah
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/a132bdef131d13b9a1ae0bff805f8f71.jpg
<Gold_Demona> Specifically, Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too. :P
*Gold_Demona is a Disney nerd
<MadSurge> Oooh this song
<Chrysalis> there is a vid, of duke nukem
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: i love beauty and the beast
<Chrysalis> reading 50 shades of grey
<MaxTheBrony> Heh I love disney but i dont know all the songs in english :D
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: hahahahah
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: Me too. That one's awesome. =)
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Stormy> I got my car :D
<Stormy> drove it to school today
<MaxTheBrony> Chrysalis is it good xD?
<MadSurge> Chrysalis: is it hilarious as they say? :D
<Chrysalis> its absolutely hilarious
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: i love it alot, i need to read the original story
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> hows it running?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> do you like it?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> pics?
<Bronysith> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc0wc5gB231qbe9hqo1_500.jpg
<Stormy> I love it
<Gold_Demona> Bronysith: The original story's quite a bit sadder.
<Bronysith> Gold_Demona: arent they usually sadder?
<Bronysith> then disney makes it happier
<Bronysith> cause you know
<Bronysith> DISNEY
<Gold_Demona> Yup
<Stormy> it's got a few dents and scratches and stuff but as far as I can tell nothing else is wrong with it at all
<Bronysith> like hunchback of notre dame
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Gold_Demona> lol Yeah
<Stormy> the first owner obviously took really good care of it
<Bronysith> or the little mermaid
<Bronysith> that is a depressing one
<Bronysith> depressing yet beautiful
<Stormy> Insurance was only $60/month
<Gold_Demona> Disney's notorious for taking HUGE artistic license on everything they make. That's why I try not to worry about the original content when I watch them. :P
<Bronysith> hehe
<Kimori> not bad
<Gold_Demona> It's more enjoyable that way
<Kimori> Id like to see pics too
<Bronysith> but im a sucker for original stories
<Gold_Demona> Like how I try not to think about all the Greek mythology they got wrong in Hercules. :D
<Stormy> I've got one on my phone... one minute
<Bronysith> but disney does a great job
<Gold_Demona> That it does
<Bronysith> and my god
<Bronysith> the villain songs
<Bronysith> my god
<Bronysith> once you hear hellfire everything else isnt as good though
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> what kind of coverage do you get for $60 a month?
<Bronysith> https://images.4chan.org/mlp/src/1350494776532.png the face of my childhood nightmares
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> theft? collision? liability amount?
<Stormy> Just bodily injury and property damage
<Stormy> I didn't do collision because it wasn't a very expensive car
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> without collission mine was like $135 a month
<Lil_B> Dat Feel when you buy a new game and play for almost 5 hours streight >.<
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> shows you what the private market can do to reduce rates
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Gold_Demona> ^^
<Bronysith> dat feel when you download RIFT and play it for 20 hours straight forgetting to go to the bathroom and e3ating
<Bronysith> no seriously
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you are forced to use one insurance company here, ran by the province of british columbia.
<Dken2021> in fact, I'm doing that right now
<Stormy> I also get emergency roadside coverage and renter's insurance basically free so that was nice
<Bronysith> i bought rift and that actually happened
<Stormy> oh, that sucks. =/
<Dken2021> dang grinding
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you had a small accident before didnt you?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> did that effect your rates?
<Bronysith> but it didnt feel like it
<Bronysith> RIFT was a great MMO
<Stormy> Yeah, but I didn't have my license yet so it "didn't count"
<prince-dari> Bronysith, you're like those Korean people that die because the plays Starcraft without eating or sleeping.
<prince-dari> they*
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Stormy> I didn't even have to tell them about it
<Bronysith> prince-dari: hence why i stopped playing MMOs dabi
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> interesting
<Bronysith> now if you exuse me
<Lil_B> Bronysith that reminds me of a cconversation I once read about "according to the class book I wass missing on this day... one might think I would notice wehen you 'forget' a day" other guy "Well, I know what happened, Diablo 3 came out, I skippd school that day too xD"
<Bronysith> i have to go to the bathroom and watch the Rebuilds
<Stormy> Yeah, I'm not entirely sure how that worked out
<ShyBetaFemale> I CAN'T WAIT TO GO CLUBBING TONIGHT
<ShyBetaFemale> IT'S GONNA BE SO FUN
<Stormy> the accident was completely my fault
<Bronysith> i give no fuck
<Stormy> I'm not complaining though :P
<Dken2021> excellent ShyBetaFemale
<Lil_B> ShyBetaFemale the poor seals :( why club them?
<Stormy> Also helps that they gave me discounts for going through their safe driver thing a few months ago and getting good grades
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> my brother took his road test again
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> failed the second time
<ShyBetaFemale> because Lil_B those seals are actually bottles of beer and they need to be neutralized
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> ah
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I took a driving course but it didn't effect my rates or anything
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but I got extra credit for school.
<Kimori> What kind of car did you buy?
<Lil_B> oh... ok xD
<Stormy> 2000 Honda Accord, I'm uploading the picture now
<ShyBetaFemale> ;D
<Kimori> Spyrorocks would it better if I didnt turn the computer off?
<Lil_B> I hate clubbing, Discos are always full of Jerks and bad music + I'm terrible (according to SaturnxD)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Kimori doesnt matter.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> your disk probably isn't failing.
<Stormy> http://imgur.com/qp1xs
<Dken2021> I don't recall disco being popular these days
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Just keep an eye on things if you start to notice issues with opening files or programs, or the disk is making strange noises...
<alexxm> i think he means clubbing
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Stormy that car should last many more years
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> honda keeps on running.
<Lil_B> yeah, everything that Involves non classical music with dancing is Disco for me
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> how much?
<Stormy> $3995
<Kimori> That car looks good
<Stormy> with taxes and title transfer fees it ended up costing about $4300
<Stormy> they had a nice discount at that lot that day; I was really lucky
<ShyBetaFemale> well Lil_B, if that's what saturn has told you about clubs, he makes himself sound like...well...
<ShyBetaFemale> kind of a bitch.
<Kimori> Was the previous owner the first owner?
<MaxTheBrony> can you guys give me some pointers on a work in progress :)?
<Stormy> Yeah
<Kimori> Nice
<MaxTheBrony> http://maxtheswed.deviantart.com/art/Dishonored-OC-WIP-1-332872903?ga_submit=10%3A1350496578
<Lil_B> ShyBetaFemale no, he did none of that xD thats all my own opinion
<ShyBetaFemale> well that's a mean opinion
<ShyBetaFemale> clubs are fun
<prince-dari> >a mean opinion
<prince-dari> u srs?
<ShyBetaFemale> yeah and a wrong one too
<prince-dari> pls go
<ShyBetaFemale> who are you?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I paid $400 for my '99 rav4 lol
<prince-dari> This is something entirely subjective
<Lil_B> I'm sorry, but I'm just speaking of what I personally have expirienced so far myself
<prince-dari> You can't just say "it's wrong. ;'("
<Kimori> What was wrong with it?
<AJIsAwesome> MaxTheBrony: I like it. :)
*MaxTheBrony stands back, dont want to get engaged in that.
<MaxTheBrony> AJIsAwesome: Thank you :)
<Lil_B> maybe the CLubs at your place are awesome, and you have a really good time there with nice people, but I have none of that
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> head gasket blown
<Kimori> Did you fix it yourself?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> cost like $1k to get it fixed
<Kimori> :/
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> No im no mehcanic
<Kimori> Thats still a good deal
<ShyBetaFemale> it really depends on how you perceive nice
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> mechanic
<prince-dari> Are you sure you're even old enough to go clubbing, just I wouldn't have guessed you're 18.
<Chrysalis> everything you know is wrong
<Chrysalis> clubbing is overrated
<ShyBetaFemale> maybe for you
<ShyBetaFemale> i love it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But I dont like dealing with used cars
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> especially ones like 13 years old like the rav4
<Lil_B> yes, and that's your opinion :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> stuff just starts dying eventually
<ShyBetaFemale> i meet new people, i party with them, get new friends, have an awesome time
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and it becomes a moneypit, and unreliable.
<ShyBetaFemale> i mean if you don't like clubbing that's cool but don't blame everyone else for it :P
<Kimori> We are a big fan of Ford Escorts
<AJIsAwesome> Anyone going to the Anime Evolution con?
<Kimori> The problem with used cars is that you don't know what the previous owner did
<Blako> brb

<Stormy> Assuming I take the full loan amount they allow for next semester
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> wellp… could be worse.
<Barbetos> Most games run off of 2, and I am pretty sure it is that way with PS2
<Stormy> hah
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> do you have a job lined up?
<Barbetos> It does not make sense from a dev stand point to make a game use more at the moment
<Stormy> No :(
<Wrek> 05reason comp crashed was that the streaming app capped memory
<Barbetos> Cuase most people only have 2
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I know people who are like, $60k-$120k
<Wrek> 05or slowed down enough to warrant me to reboot
<Wrek> 05not really a crash
<Stormy> I got lots of scholarships
<RaveBrony> Wait.... tabitha is going to be at Anime Evolution??
<Barbetos> Hrrrmmm.
<Stormy> And I've worked in the food service all four years
<Barbetos> Is that core an APU or is the new FX series wrek?
<ShyBetaFemale> Lil_B it'll be fun :D usually i don't like the music either, but when i'm really drunk i don't care, and i'm optimistic enough as it is so whatever
<Lil_B> does PS2 use multiple Cores? I know a lot of modern Games don't even really use 2 cores max no matter how many you have
<AJIsAwesome> RaveBrony: Yep.
<RaveBrony> Fuuuuuu!!!!!!!!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> did your parents help you out?
<Stormy> most people apparently aren't willing to do that even if they're going to have to pay back thousands of dollars of debt =/
<Stormy> yeah they had some money saved
<RaveBrony> That. totally. Sucks.
<Lil_B> ShyBetaFemale xD another Point, I don't drink alcohol, I'm a damn big partybomb, trust me xD
<Stormy> but I have two siblings and they're both going to college too
<Barbetos> Lil_B Honestly, I do not know for sure
<Kandarihu> I had a bit of a scary experience yesterday in which my comp just froze up completely.
<Barbetos> PS2 does not have a multicore option
<MadSurge> Lil_B! :$
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> your brother is probably in college now is he?
<Lil_B> hey MadSurge !
<Barbetos> So I assume, it is either on by default, or not on at all
<Stormy> Yeah, he's a sophomore
<Barbetos> Which if not at all then that would be real dumb
<Stormy> My sister is still only a freshman in high school
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: happened to me when it occasionally overheats
<Barbetos> Wrek having two cores running at 4.5 is better than what some i7s can do
<Kandarihu> I just let the computer stay like that for a while, and it just slowly came back to life. That's the really wierd thing.
<prince-dari> Huh, didn't even know you had a sister
<Barbetos> Which is another reason why, kiddies, always go AMD.
<Kandarihu> MadSurge, what CPU are you using? AMD or Intel?
<Stormy> I didn't used to get along with her at all :P
<Lil_B> well, AMD has some mayjor Problems atm
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: Intel
<Stormy> So if I ever mentioned her it was probably to complain about how annoying she was
<Wrek> 05Barbetos: hmm
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Wrek> 05lemme check
<prince-dari> Lawl, I think you might have actually compared her to Hail at some point
<Stormy> hahaha
<Lil_B> and if they don't fix them within the next year they will be gone
<prince-dari> Or maybe I'm imagining things
<Kandarihu> I see. I have AMD. It's a cheapo Laptop
<Wrek> 05AMD thenom II X6 1100T
<Stormy> that woudldn't surprise me if I did that
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: this is an OLD laptop
<Wrek> 05its close to... 1 or 2 years old by now
<Barbetos> Aight. I might see what I can get for that one with a black edition
<Barbetos> Cuase that clock you ahve, yeah.
<Stormy> she would've been about the same age I think... maybe a little older
<Barbetos> I have a boner right now
<Barbetos> It hurts.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you come to like your siblings more as you grow older.
<Lil_B> I know some HardCore AMD Fans who are switching to Intel now because the Bulldozer and Piledriver AMD CPUs have big problems
<Stormy> yeah, once you don't live with them anymore
<Wrek> 05comp never goes above 55 degrees either
<Stormy> same with my parents
<Wrek> 05gotta love proper cooling
<Barbetos> Dear god
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Barbetos> Water cooling?
<Barbetos> Or air?
<Wrek> 05air
<Barbetos> It must be that Swedish air
<Stormy> I don't have to put up with crap from my family every day so they don't annoy me anymore
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<Wrek> 05most likely
<Barbetos> Nice cool and crisp
<Wrek> 05i got a decent GPU aswell
<Wrek> 05TGX580
<Stormy> My sister became a lot less annoying though
<Lil_B> They have 8 Cores, yet get outperformend bye the i7 and even the previous AMD Processor, although I'm not technical enough to explain what a "Floating point issue" is
<DashWithRainbows> Wrek So, how much did that cost you all together?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> she grew up.
<Barbetos> I have a ATI 6970
<DashWithRainbows> Estimated of course.
<Barbetos> Beastly card
<Stormy> and I stopped being mean to her, so that helped :P
<Barbetos> Just, my proc sucks
<Barbetos> the fucking HT is stuck at like 200
<Wrek> 05all my hardware is aprox worth 2000$ at this time
<Barbetos> And if I take it up any it does not stay stable
<Wrek> 05countign screens, joysticsk darw pads adn everything inside the case
<DashWithRainbows> I cringed at that price
<Barbetos> Sounds about right
<Barbetos> Same here for mine
<DashWithRainbows> but that seems like to be a sweet ass computer
<Barbetos> Just need a new mobo and proc now
<Stormy> it's weird, she's going to be learning to drive soon
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lolol
<Wrek> 05only quirk i have with it is the OS :p
<Stormy> and she's taller than me -.-
<Wrek> 05ratehr have linux but oh well
<Barbetos> Cause ps2 is bringing my proc to its knees.
<Stormy> how'd that happen
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> "I stopped being mean to her", that made me lol.
<Stormy> well I was a bitch to her :P
<Lil_B> yeah... Facebook has had a really awesome Idea... construckt a Serverfarm in Scandiinavia, it will be ekofriendly cooled by air... because it's cold there!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yeah my little brother is about my height
<Stormy> but only because she annoyed me
<Kandarihu> I once saw a Youtube video that compared how various CPUs handle high load if the heatsink is removed. All of the Intels recovered, and all of the AMDs died.
<Barbetos> Dual os wrek?
<Stormy> it was an endless cycle
<Wrek> 05right now my focus is to upgrade to 16gb memory and anotehr 580 to bridge with the existing one
<Wrek> 05too lazy Barbetos
<Barbetos> I feel the same way
<Barbetos> Need more instentive to daul os.
<Lil_B> Wrek you do 3D Work or other actual Producing Work on your PC?
<Barbetos> Considering that Linux supports zero games
<Barbetos> welll...
<Wrek> 05yeh
<Barbetos> That ruins its chances
<alexxm> is there a stream?
<Lil_B> Barbetos a lot of Indies + Steam for Linux this Winter
<Barbetos> I play real games
<Barbetos> Sorry
<Wrek> 05the games will come once win8 is launched
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> ah
<Barbetos> Oh.
<Lil_B> Barbetos like Soccer?
<Kandarihu> Steam is coming out for Linux? Really?
<Wrek> 05casue all publishers fear win8
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> is it bad that I dislike reading fanfiction of any kind
<Barbetos> Sorry. Nah I know. Indie games are awesome <3
<Barbetos> I love soccer
<Lil_B> Kandarihu yeah
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/6c6b18b13509be02ab340bc9254a756c.png OH DEAR GOD WHAT D8
<Stormy> I feel pretty bad for it now
<Barbetos> football is what I call it though
<Stormy> Lol no, definitely not
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I just can't stand it
<Stormy> most fanfiction is terrible
<Barbetos> I figure there rest of the world calls soccer foot ball, so I figure I will too.
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: :|
<Barbetos> Follow the crowd right?
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: ..........
<Stormy> Some of it is good but I just don't have time for it
<MadSurge> Ikr :'( poor Twilight
*GriffonCherry huggles the whole chat.
<Barbetos> I missed it, did MadSurge make a poo in the chat again?
*AJIsAwesome hugs GriffonCherry :)
<BladedWings> hi GriffonCherry *hugs back*
<Lil_B> Wrek I was just asking because 16GB RAM is enough for a serious Gamer, but I would suggest waiting for DDR4 RAM wich should come out next year
<Barbetos> back to ps2
<MadSurge> Barbetos: I found a scary image D:
<Lil_B> hi GriffonCherry
<GriffonCherry> I still have my eyes on you... BladedWings....
<AJIsAwesome> It's the link he posted, Barbetos/
<Sylandest> howdy Lil_B
<AJIsAwesome> *.
*Chrysalis rocks outy
<Barbetos> I was kicked
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Lil_B :)
<Barbetos> Can i see?
<Wrek> 05Lil_B: i worry about compability
<BladedWings> GriffonCherry: :O CrazyCherry!?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> people always link me to stuff
<Lil_B> Good day there Sylandest and MaxTheBrony :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and they are like, its so good
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: Link it again?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but i dont find it entertaining at all.
<MadSurge> PM'd
<Lil_B> Wrek yeah, a new Mainboard will probably be required
<GriffonCherry> BladedWings: Yup. How didn't you see the similarity?
<Kandarihu> DDR4 RAM? Is it going to be as cheap as DDR3 RAM?
*Sylandest huggles Lil_B
<Stormy> I seem to recall you saying you don't like reading
<Wrek> 05not on release Kandarihu
<Wrek> 05but yeah with the additional ram and graph card
<Stormy> so that could be part of it
*Lil_B hugs Sylandest back :3
<Wrek> 05this machine will last me 5+ years
<Wrek> 05then i can consider upgrading again
<Kandarihu> What's the good thing about DDR4 RAM?
<BladedWings> GriffonCherry: this chat room has tons of similar nicknames...i just assume everyone is different until proven otherwise :$
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I can't read fiction.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> But i read all day on my computer :P
<GriffonCherry> Wrek: What. You rich bitch. :D
<Stormy> that's something I can't do
<Wrek> 05it hasnt to do with being rich
<Stormy> reading on a computer screen
<AJIsAwesome> Wait
<GriffonCherry> Wrek: :P
<Wrek> 05it has to do about prioritizing and long term planning
<AJIsAwesome> GriffonCherry is CrazyCherry? :O
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> well since I got my new laptop text looks clearer, so its like your looking at paper
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I turn the brightness right down and can read for hours
*GriffonCherry headkeyboards.
<Stormy> for some reason I just zone out when I'm trying to read long blocks of text on a screen
<AJIsAwesome> :$
<Lil_B> Kandarihu faster, here is an example, 4GB of DDR3 Ram is better than 8GB of DDR2 RAM
<GriffonCherry> I'm done!!
<AJIsAwesome> BladedWings: Same here. :$
<Chrysalis> Lil_B thats why you get 8gb of ddr3
<Stormy> So if the article or whatever has really long paragraphs I just don't read it
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> tldr ?
<Stormy> Pretty much
*BladedWings hugs GriffonCherry "it's ok" ^_^
<Lil_B> Kandarihu and every Mainboard and OS has a Maximum of GB of RAM that it can work with, so if you can the most out of each one
<Lil_B> Chrysalis I'm planning 16GB for my new PC
<Stormy> I could have summed up everything I just said by just writing tl;dr
*GriffonCherry nuzzles BladedWings. "Okies. :3"
<Stormy> kind of ironic
<BladedWings> yay
<Chrysalis> should be getting 32 at christmas
<Wrek> 05so yeah
<AJIsAwesome> Sorry, GriffonCherry. :D
<Wrek> 05more planetside... or anotehr game..
<Barbetos> Wrek 500 more Aux and I can get Zepher
<Barbetos> Want to bomb for it?
<Barbetos> Bombing is loads of fun
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> OK this is terrible
<AJIsAwesome> I'd like to see another game. :)

<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> looks a bit fake though.
<Stormy> wait so Pinkamena Diane is okay, but Twilight Sparkle isn't? :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> yes.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you are correct.
<Stormy> wat
<Stormy> if you say so
<BladedWings> damn, flash crash XD
<Lil_B> MadSurge I saw a Picture once of Spike as Pony surrounmded by the Main 6 as Dragons :)

<Wrek> 05Amp Station: Overcharged base turrets, longer overload times on facility generators
<Wrek> 05Tech Plant: Access to MBTs - yes, facilities will be unable to spawn MBTs without a connected tech plant
<killerpony7733> Oooh

<Stormy> ...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> i dunno...
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you can kind of order them online for $15...
<Stormy> seems... legit?
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/ebadb0f29d60c49a2cda00e3db162e80.jpg :D :3
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> Unless your me
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> in that case they are like $50
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> because they jack up the shipping to an unholy amount.
<AJIsAwesome> MadSurge: WUT :D
<MadSurge> http://s3.amazonaws.com/bronibooru/42fac59639be70d03b26226e8b4cc842.jpg Mane 6 are best hamsters!

<GriffonCherry> pot80: I see nothing but a pot. Who spoke?
<VenHur> Wrek: Play the Jak and Daxter series chronologically, expect Daxter, since there isn't a good emulator for the PSP/Vita...

<Lil_B> btw alexxm|colt you here?
<alexxm|colt> yeah Lil_B
*pot80 vigorously shakes Lil_B 's hand as well
<Wrek> 05suggesting me to play console games of any kind is a bad idea
<VenHur> And I wouldn't want to spoil about Jak 3, but to those that haven't played it, there's a good "WTF" moment.
<Wrek> 05also in addition to bullshit
<Wrek> 05im thinking of gettign all seasons of dexter
<Wrek> 05cause why not
<Lil_B> alexxm|colt just wanna thank you for Kung Fu Hustle :3
<alexxm|colt> thanks Lil_B
<Lil_B> I love that Movie :)
<GilDash> Holla everypony! :)
<GriffonCherry> pot80: Wut. D:
<Eli> Wrek: i loved the J&D series. but i only played until the 3d one
<pot80> Wrek: dexter the series or dexter's lab the cartoon series?
<Chrysalis> socks are cool
<Everlasting_Joy> pot80: I think the serial killer.
<Kandarihu> Ah, this song
<VenHur> Rainbows are cool.
<pot80> Everlasting_Joy: aw :(
<Eli> Wrek: the Dexter with Michael C. hall is nice too
<Everlasting_Joy> pot80: I have S1 of Dexter's Lab.
<Lil_B> guten Tag GilDash :)
<GilDash> Lil_B: Umm... holla? :D
<pot80> GriffonCherry but you asked who was speaking and how you only saw pot and I got confused
<Eli> Lil_B: you're confusing him...
<Lil_B> GilDash it's just good day xD
<GilDash> Lil_B: I know roughly what it means. I was just being silly. :p
<Lil_B> Eli ?Que?
<Lil_B> GilDash I know :P
<pot80> It's been so long since I last saw dexters lab :P
<GriffonCherry> pot80: So I saw you! :O
<Eli> Lil_B: want me to start speaking french or swiss german? cuz that is REAL hell
<GilDash> Lil_B: If I really wanted to be silly I'd go all British and complain about the blitz or something. XD
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/gnPvQ.jpg
<Lil_B> Eli swiss german... Dat Jänner xD
<pot80> GriffonCherry: oh... sorry :P
<XxNightHawk64xX> wazzup guys
<Eli> Lil_B: Jänner?
<Lil_B> GilDash Blitz? whats the british definition of Blitz?
<Lil_B> Eli sorry, Jänner is Austria >.<
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, XxNightHawk64xX. :)
<GilDash> Lil_B: The period during World War 2 where Britain was being bombed? :S
<Lil_B> hi XxNightHawk64xX :)
<Eli> Lil_B: if it's supposed to mean January, well we say that too, but it's slang
<GilDash> XxNightHawk64xX: Holla! :)
<XxNightHawk64xX> yo does anyone know excactly how fast rainbow dash goes during the sonic rainboom. not according to fanfic but actual official fact
<pot80> alloha XxNightHawk64xX
<Lil_B> GilDash ... I only know about operation Sea Lion, but this operaTION NEVER STARTED .7
<Lil_B> Eli I know
<pot80> take that floor
<GilDash> Lil_B: Never heard of it. XD
<Eli> XxNightHawk64xX: finding facts in a cartoon series, you're gonna have a bad time
<AJIsAwesome> XxNightHawk64xX: Not sure but there have been experiments/videos, I think.
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<Kandarihu> Ah, the song has an ending
<XxNightHawk64xX> i know ust im a huge sonic/mlp fan and i really want to find out who is faster sonic or RD
<AJIsAwesome> Ah, I see. :)
<Lil_B> GilDash well, the operation never started, because... Sowjets and D-Day and Stuff :P
<GilDash> Lil_B: Yay? :S
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: i've seen one of these vids, i think it's quite famous, but i think it's BS. assuming a pegasus has the same weight as a normal pony with that wingspan... just doesn't add up
<pot80> XxNightHawk64xX: I think I saw a ytube vid about how fast she goes based on the shape of the cone on air around her but of course im not allowed to send it to you atm XD
<AJIsAwesome> Eli: I can understand that. I'm not one to question logic in a cartoon, anyway. :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Nice, the NC has basically taken the map :).
<Lil_B> GilDash I'm ok with History :) *unless someonme is a douce with it, than I can get REALLY uncomfortable)
<Eli> AJIsAwesome: me neither. if it were all logic, it would be as boring as RL
<GilDash> Lil_B: I know next to nothing about history at all. Honestly, I can't even tell you what happened last week hald the time. XD
<Lil_B> GilDash ok, I'm terrible at what's going on int he World right now, but in everything that's before the fall of the Berlin Wall I'm interrested :P
<MadSurge> Hello GilDash! :$
<GilDash> Lil_B: Well, to summerise today's issues: We're all going to go bankrupt and it's the end of society. XD
<GilDash> MadSurge: Holla! :)
<BladedWings> this has probably been asked and answered but what song is playing?
<Chrysalis> DCd wtfd
<GilDash> I wouldn't know. My internet is being quite crap today and refuses to load the stream.
<Ralin> XxNightHawk64xX: She goes 1635 m/s or around 3400 mph.
<XxNightHawk64xX> Ralin: is that official fact
<Ralin> According to her mach cone it is.
<GilDash> What offical fact? The Sonic Rainboom doesn't exactly have official figures. XD
<BladedWings> chat derp :P
<pot80> XxNightHawk64xX: found the vid says something about a mach cone and after measuring it and working it out she was going at 1635.31 m/s- damnangit Ralin
<XxNightHawk64xX> k
<Ralin> The formula would be sin(X) = V(sound)/V(Rainbow Dash)
<Kimori_mobile> hey all, hope I didnt miss much
<Ralin> And since the andle is about 12 and the speed of sound (on earth) is 340 m/s, it works out to that.
<Ralin> *angle
<XxNightHawk64xX> Ralin: but if the sonic rainboom is just a sonic boom and ranbow at the same time doesnt that just meen she goes the speed of sound when she hits the sonic rainboom which is 750-1000 mph
<Panda|Sketching> GOOD MORNING SB!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02HAI :D
<pot80> XxNightHawk64xX: yep thats what the guy on the vid said was wrong as well
*Panda|Sketching glomps SB and gives him Denny's
*NewSuperBronyU hugs Panda|Sketching back while nomming on the Denny's
<Panda|Sketching> ^^
<Stormy> nope
<XxNightHawk64xX> pot80: so she goes 750-1000 miles per hour at max speed
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, NewSuperBronyU :3
<pot80> but... it could be different (ie different air pressure) in equestria XD XxNightHawk64xX
<Kimori_mobile> did you have to do any repairs on the car?
<pot80> because speed of sound depends on the air and its pressure and stuff
<Stormy> No, actually
<AJIsAwesome> Silence.........
<Sylandest> chat derp
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02AJIsAwesome: :3
<AJIsAwesome> :3
<Stormy> we got it looked at and didn't find anything wrong with it
<pot80> but yes id think on a place with an earth like atmosphere pressure she would travel at about 750-1000 miles per hour XxNightHawk64xX
<Stormy> the first thing to go is going to be the break pads, but that's not going to be for a while
*Lil_B huggles NewSuperBronyU
<XxNightHawk64xX> but if the air pressure is the same doesnt that mean RD's max speed (rainbowdash
<Kimori_mobile> I probabaly should have mone checked too soon
<Kimori_mobile> mine*
<Ralin> XxNightHawk64xX: But the mach cone also changes with the speed of sound, so then she still goes several times the speed of sound.
<XxNightHawk64xX> is the same exact speed as sonics average speed
<Stormy> what kind of car do you have?
<Kimori_mobile> Ford escort :)
<Stormy> ah
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lolwhat random screw http://i53.tinypic.com/b8krp.jpg
<Kimori_mobile> what is that?
<Ralin> And the pressure can't be that much different or all the ponies would die of anoxia.
*NewSuperBronyU huggles dat Lil_B back :D
<pot80> I know I was just trying to think about how the mach cone would appear before the actual rainboom :P
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> something a guy was working on
<butthurt> so metal
<alexxm> is there a stream?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> for some reason he has a randm screw hot glued in there that does absolutly nothing
<AJIsAwesome> Yep.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> he calls it the "ground screw"
<Ralin> Maybe she already broke the sound barrier, and the rainboom is some kind of secondary effect once she hits several mach?
<Kimori_mobile> lol..
<Lil_B> I like that we are discussing about a Mach Cone that has the Ability, that has the ability to forse RD back to 0 Speed, hold her there for a comedix pause, and than even give here a acceleration towards the other direction
<ShyBetaFemale> aww yeah gonna put on my fancy cologne
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> apparently the guy at radioshack told him the third terminal had to be conencted to the "ground screw"
<ShyBetaFemale> fuckin' irresistible lemme tell you
<Ralin> Lil_B: We must, for Science!
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> which is an automotive term I suppose for "ground"
<AJIsAwesome> Even thought I'm not one to question logic in cartoons, it's actually quite interesting to hear you guys talk about these kinds of things. :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> because it must be an automotive part
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> so he took it litterally and glued a wire to a screw and glued the screw in
<pot80> Ralin: but there was no sonic boom (of sound) before the rainboom appeared... hell why am i thinking so deeply into this XD
<XxNightHawk64xX> pot80: cause where nerds dude its in our nature
<Ralin> Rainbow dash doesn't make enough noise to cause an appreciable sonic boom?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> http://i.imgur.com/65dDF.gif
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> (its not what you think it is.)
<Blako> :D
<pot80> or maby she was so high up in the atmosphere that the sound wasnt as loud and there wasn't as great an effect
<BladedWings> dat skype
<Ralin> But she was below Cloudsdale, and that means that there should be more than enough atmosphere to breathe in, so there still should be enough to carry sound well.
<scout19_tf2> hey YO wuts up everypony:)
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, scout19_tf2. :)
<scout19_tf2> hmmmm chat must be sleeping eh
<scout19_tf2> whos streaming
<scout19_tf2> ?
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek.
<scout19_tf2> shud of known he pllays dis game alot
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm going to take off folks.
<pot80> ralin but she started off above cloudsdail and above the collusium?
<Stormy> just found out my paper is due tonight at midnight :(
<scout19_tf2> later Everlasting_Joy
<Stormy> and I have other work to do too
<Sumica> 00,10well that was a dick move
<alexxm> bye Everlasting_Joy
<Stormy> damn school
<AJIsAwesome> BYe, Everlasting_Joy. :)
<BladedWings> hi scout19_tf2 and bye Joy
<Ralin> pot80: But not that much higher, and we already know that the difference in air pressure between the surface and cloudsdale is negligable.
<ASoftFluffyThing> http://imgur.com/kt6Ss
<pot80> though it was high enough for the suns rays to suddenly become powerfull enough to burn raritys wings suggesting a much lower pressure as well as the fact that rarity was struggling to breath up there?
<Ralin> And since pressure scales linearly, then it that means that the difference between cloudsdale and the site of the rainboom should also be negligable.
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: :D
<BladedWings> lol ASoftFluffyThing
<Ralin> pot80: I interpreted the trouble breathing as panting from the heat.
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome, BladedWings: Dat paperclip. If I ever saw that, I wouldn't know whether to :D or D:
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: Me too. :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome: So many memories of rage that little thing bought us.
<pot80> and the sudden burning of the wings?
<Ralin> Idk.
<BladedWings> ASoftFluffyThing: i always changed it from the paper clip to the robot lol
<AJIsAwesome> I always changed it to the wizard. :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> BladedWings, I disabld ALL of them
<Ralin> Also, magic wings, made of moring dew.
<BladedWings> ASoftFluffyThing: :D
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> you should quit.
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> school that is, not irc.
<Ralin> But either way, it shouldn't matter, because the rainboom occured below cloudsdale.
<Bromany> Hallooooooo everypony :)
<scout19_tf2> helloooooooo Bromany
<BladedWings> hi Bromany
<alexxm> how are things Bromany
<pot80> yes but I was making a sugesstion for the sonic boom that should have occured earlier due to the mach cone but didnt
<pot80> hey Bromany
<Bromany> fine fine, don't know why but I am in a great mood tonight
<Ralin> ok, thats legitamate.
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Bromany. :)
<Bromany> Hi there AJIsAwesome
<AJIsAwesome> Glad to see you're happy. :)
<Bromany> thank you ^^, hope you are in a good mood too
<Emmie> Hello~
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, Emmie. :)
<Bromany> Hiya Emmie
<Emmie> hai ^^
<Lil_B> hi emmie :)
<pot80> hey emmie get it :P
<pot80> cause hey an...
<Lil_B> gonmna plöay some more Harveys new eyes, gonna train my brain a bit, some good old Point and Click Adventure Time :)
<scout19_tf2> olo emmie
<MadSurge> Yaaaaay Black Swan is on tv :D
<Stormy> lol
<Stormy> I only have one semester left to pay for
<MadSurge> Lil_B: so it's a good game?
<Stormy> so not getting a degree might be kind of a waste of money
<Lil_B> ... oin the other Hand... My Dad just called me, Citizen Kane is on TV
<Lil_B> MadSurge I think so, it got humor, the loading times are ok, the Interface is easy, and the Writing and Voice Acting is good
<MadSurge> Ooooh, great movie :$
<Lil_B> MadSurge It's made in germany though, I don't know how good the english dub is
<Lil_B> MadSurge and it is a Sequel to another game, but so far you didn't really needed to know anything major from the first game
<Lil_B> I like how it starts, you are a little innocent Girl in a monastery together with other Children and a Grumpy Nun, the first Chapeter ends with you killing basicly all of the other kids by accident
<MadSurge> Lil_B: it's humorous then?
<Lil_B> and all the gore, dead bodys, or splattered blood is removed by a Gobling whith Pink Paint :P
<Lil_B> MadSurge yes
<Lil_B> MadSurge like Monkey Island
<Bromany> oh, harveys eyes
<Bromany> awesome game
<Lil_B> MadSurge the first game even had a Sticker on the Front "From the Creators of (crossed out), From the Guys who liked Monkey Island"
<Lil_B> but I think the Girl with the Long Pink Hair called "SHy" is a coincident and not a reference xD
<Lil_B> Shy*
<Lil_B> it's currently on Sale on Stream because it just got there, only ~12or 14$ I think
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> lol
<Bromany> Lil_B did you already play Whispered World ?
<Lil_B> the one where you play Edna?
<AJIsAwesome> 2 minutes and 44 seconds.
<Cades> hey
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> sup
<Bromany> no, Whispered World is from Daedelic too, but in another setting
<Lil_B> I'll google it
<Bromany> i would recommend it too, backgrounds are hand-drawn and it's got a nice soundtrack
<Lil_B> ah, ok , I've seen only Screenshots so far, it looks nice
<Cades> at school, you?
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> at work
<Cades> ah

<StinkomanFan> Oh thank GOD! I thought it was another generic Space Marine game.
<BoroBrony> hells yeah killerpony7733
<BoroBrony> :D
<Stormy> they would toss your application and look at the hundreds of others they have to read over
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> If its a big company
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> but if its a small one they might get a kick out of it :P
<Stormy> maybe, but you'd still probably never hear from them
<Cades> or you could just screw around at a job interview
<MaxTheBrony> Ohai :)
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> I also want to get a bunch of movie prop money
<Stormy> I'm extremely cynical about the job market at the moment
<Queen_Chrysalis> ohai
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> walk into a mall with a backpack that accidentally unzips and spills stacks of $100 bills all over
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> and see what people do
<Stormy> 75% of my applications get nothing
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> thats common.
<Stormy> The ones where I get interviews I never get called back
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> do you press them afterwords?
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya MaxTheBrony
<Spyrorocks[Laptop]> call in a week later and ask how its going
<Amu-chan> The last time I did a job search, I got two interviews out of however many applications I put out. Lucky me one of the places liked me enough to hire me. XD
<BoroBrony> dam right :) TR FTW lol and hi MaxTheBrony :)
<Stormy> I used to, but I've heard that that usually just annoys them
<Stormy> because everyone does it now
<Stormy> So they just delete all the voice mails of people asking about that

<Stormy> That's smart
<Michael> BoroBrony: LMAO
<Keir> Pink3: Intel has a problem that will tell you. What os you on?
<Stormy> Looking back I think I really should have done that
<Amu-chan> I actually kind of enjoy the pace and atmosphere of working in retail for now, so I figure I'll stick with it until I find something that really calls to me. If it does and I need a degree, then I'll go to college.
<Keir> program*
<Pink3> Keir: Os?

<Stormy> Eventually I just picked a college without any idea of what I wanted to do just to shut my parents up and make them give me my laptop back
<[Alpha]> alright just cleared 4,000 emails :P
<Michael> MadSurge: :)
<Keir> Pink3: right click "My computer" icon and go to properties at the bottom the general tab should show you
<Stormy> They tell you you can just do general education credits for two years until you figure it out, but that's completely untrue
<Kimori> Did they help you with money to pay for college?
<AJIsAwesome> http://th02.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2012/290/2/a/derpy_summons_her_persona_by_suikuzu-d5i4a18.png

<AJIsAwesome> Hi, NxPaqu. :)

<[Alpha]> He already knew it was the scary maze game.
<[Alpha]> I didn't show it to him either
<BoroBrony> i see why did he play then
<Socks> Does that not spoil the suprise somewhat?

<Kimori_mobile> I dont know what to say....that college really did screw you
<Socks> Agreed ^
<BoroBrony> second that ^^
<soulrider95> what did they change this time?
<Reikim> To be fair, Youtube, while becoming exponentially more annoying, has added exponentially new things.
<Kimori_mobile> but you will get the degree, it cant be a total loss
<Reikim> Fun things.
*Laurayne Covers My Ears "Oh Noez Its Starting!" D:
<Reikim> Like shows.
<AJIsAwesome> Reikim: Agreed.
<twilight_sprinkle> i was fine was the last change, even though it was annoying, but now theyre asking for real names and they arent allowing you to hide your channel. if you dont unhide it, they delete it
<Reikim> Did you know Funimation has a Youtube page with a crapton of their shows? For free?
<Laurayne> My Fantasiez Is Comeing Out! >.<
<Hat> Youtube keeps changing things for the sake of it
<Laurayne> http://i752.photobucket.com/albums/xx170/redyuri12/untitled2.jpg
<soulrider95> reallY? I was allowed to keep my non-real name....
<Hat> I'm looking forward to CoH2
<Socks> Some features on new youtube I don't mind but the new style of video player bugs out like hell.
<Laurayne> xD
<twilight_sprinkle> nittany was told to set his real name
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01twilight_sprinkle: Wut?
<ekips> Does someone know if there is a version of the german musical Elisabeth with english subtitles?
<Laurayne> I Have FUNimation's Youtube Page In My Bookmarks xD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Oh.
<Socks> And Reikim, yes, I watched quite a bit of Full Metal Alchemisy on it :)
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: Same here. :D
<Reikim> They only ask for real name if you choose to use the stupid +1 thing.
<twilight_sprinkle> Nittany_Discord: didnt you say youtube asked you for your real name a while ago
<Socks> *Alchemist
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just remembered that.
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/Ra1w1.jpg
<soulrider95> Nittany_Discord: I was allowed to not do it, did you have that option?
<Eli> you know, i hate names like Elisabeth or words like Elite. i always think someone pinged me
<Cades> brb
<twilight_sprinkle> thats dumb, and so is the fact that they delete your account if you didnt open it to everyone
<AJIsAwesome> Shizuka: Cookies? :3

<Kimori_mobile> why does the school have a bad reputation
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome to Youtube, Youtube! :D
<Laurayne> My Name Is Youtube :D
<BoroBrony> LOLZ ^
<[Alpha]> lololol
<BoroBrony> :D :D
<Laurayne> Toushe' Random Youtube User >:3
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Spectrum_Rush> Touché
<Stormy> It doesn't really, it's just not good for the major I picked
<p4ngya> i remember seeing a T:A stream up here once, anyone know who was streaming that?
<Socks> A little too che...
<Laurayne> http://i752.photobucket.com/albums/xx170/redyuri12/KoihimeMusou-OneEyedWarrioress.jpg En Gaurd!
<Stormy> Most people at that school go into education
<Stormy> Or business/theology/other stuff like that
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: I want that sword. :O
<Laurayne> Nah Not My Style. I Prefer Bigger Swords
<AJIsAwesome> Like Buster Sword Big?
<Laurayne> Hmmm...
<Stormy> Since I was a dumb teenager and didn't know anything about colleges, I picked it because they gave me the most scholarships
<AJIsAwesome> Or Tetsugiya big?
<AJIsAwesome> Is that how you spell it?
<[Alpha]> just deleted my youtube account
<AJIsAwesome> *Tetsugaiya I think
<AJIsAwesome> [Alpha]: Who did? You?
<[Alpha]> eeyup
<AJIsAwesome> Why?
<Stormy> Tuition costs over $30000 per year and they basically gave me half that in scholarships
<Laurayne> http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y218/angelrei/Others/girlsxswordsinsaneld1.png
<Laurayne> That Big
<AJIsAwesome> Woah :O
<[Alpha]> I felt like it needed to be done
<AJIsAwesome> THat's a giant sword. :O
<AJIsAwesome> Doesn't seem sharp, though.
<twilight_sprinkle> Laurayne: perfect waifu for sephiroth
<Stormy> So I thought since it was a private school and more expensive than others it would look more presigious on resumes than the public school ten minutes away
<AJIsAwesome> Well, "that" sharp
<Laurayne> Who Needs Sharpness When you Can Flatten Them xD
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> like clouds buster sword
<Amu-chan> It's not necessarily your fault, though. I doubt you'd have made the same decision if you weren't pushed into college in the first place.
<Laurayne> Enemy Sees Sword: Ha! That THing isnt That Shar... *Squish*
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Kimori_mobile> your still young though, you can change directions
<BladedWings> aaaaand im back ^_^

<thelonepony> Ohai SafariMonkey :3
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, SafariMonkey! :)
<MadSurge> Hey SafariMonkey!
<Alchemist> I could never come up with jokes like that :(
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: -chan is usually for younger people afaik
<Eli> thelonepony: good. my "mangaish" isn't that rusty
<SafariMonkey> So what are we talking about?
<MadSurge> Alchemist: I can come up with dumb yet hilarious jokes :D
<Laurayne> *Cries And Notices* Wait Whaaaa? o.o
<MadSurge> SafariMonkey: weird stuff :D

<thelonepony> SafariMonkey: talking about Oniichan~
<AJIsAwesome> :O
<SafariMonkey> Oh?
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: so a horse walks into a bar, and the bartender asks "why the long face"?
<AJIsAwesome> Turn around and say it again!
<Alchemist> twilight_sprinkle: then 4chan means "for kids"? Seems inappropiate, which is appropiate considering its 4chan.
<thelonepony> OniiChan~
<AJIsAwesome> Turn around and say it again!
<thelonepony> OniiChan~
<AJIsAwesome> OH
<Laurayne> HEY! D:
<Laurayne> Who Dressed me Up?!
<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: how should i know why they named it 4chan
<thelonepony> Laurayne: Nittany_Discord :3
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: Nittany_Discord.
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: and the horse went "bonk" on the bar first :D
<Alchemist> twilight_sprinkle: dunno, was just guessing...
<twilight_sprinkle> Chan (ちゃん?) is a diminutive suffix; it expresses that the speaker finds a person endearing. In general, chan is used, but is not limited to, babies, young children, grandparents and teenage girls. It may also be used towards cute animals, lovers, close friends, any youthful woman, or even between friends.
<thelonepony> you look cute in a maid outfit Laurayne :3

<twilight_sprinkle> Alchemist: did 4chan start as a cute image site? thats the only obvious connection to chan i see
<Eli> speaking of maid outfits: today i saw the Big Bang episode where Sheldon gets to wear one... scarred for life
<Alchemist> dunno when was the last time I saw the maid prefix in front of nittany's name...

<alexxm> hasn't 4chan always been like that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes Laurayne.
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: maybe it's short for channel?
<AJIsAwesome> sparkarez: WUT

<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: at least MJ should be legalized
<Wrek> 05when peopel say legalize drugs
<Phase4> i've heard that maruana over time causes some kind of brain damage, i've also heard that theres a teapot orbiting the sun and that it is the one true lord, so who knows what to belive

<DJPON3> lololol
<Wrek> 05they dont say legalize deathdrugs as crack cocaine

<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: yep. i used to be a pothead
<TomatoPotato> I don't think Bronystate is a weed thing D:
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Legal drugs can be just as bad as illegal ones.
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: how would legalizing it help
<LadyCanary> Of course.
<Everlasting_Joy> Nittany_Discord: That.
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Fun that it's both sides being pounded. :P
<twilight_sprinkle> "tell the truth on this show" bahahahahaha
<SadisticPony> :D
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: like alcohol?
<LadyCanary> I assume this one is on guns. Sweet.
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: at least here it would help. it would be less "cool". which would stop a lot of young ppl here
<twilight_sprinkle> MadSurge: sure doesnt sound like theyre saying theyre not biased
<DJPON3> ???
<killerpony7733> Nittany_Discord Isn't morphine extremely addictive?
<Alister> American governement overthrow ? I'm liking this idea

<Vordox> Ah thanks
<Vordox> Shizuka: :|

<prince-dari> Eh, I heard that the only stress relief you get from fags is actually just becuase they make you breath deeply.
<brony90> sup... i just wanted to say that i´d like to see this psa bulliyng stuff... but i cant watch it, because my i promised to watch the walking dead with my father... what now?!

<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: hello Aniki
<LadyCanary> If we got rid of guns, then we'd be fucked. There are still other ways to kill people.
<LadyCanary> So it wouldnt be solving much.
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: its called a knife
<brony90> ???
<Bronysith> or a keys
*Laurayne Hides From Nittany_Discord
<Bronysith> or anything period

<Bronysith> ^

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm not going to dress you up anymore Laurayne.
<TomatoPotato> Guns don't kill people. People kill people.

<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: im ready
<Laurayne> Promise? >.>
<Wrek> 05as for gun regulation
<Cameh_Dude> >_>
<prince-dari> Yeah, but if you got rid of guns, people going crazy and gunning down a whole school full of people is less likely.
<twilight_sprinkle> TomatoPotato: false, its bullets
*Shizuka 13whispers BANG at wrek :3
<Everlasting_Joy> If self-defense was dangerous, I'd of killed someone by now.
<Phase4> brony90, i'm not ure what 'this psa bullying stuff' is, if its on the stream i can't watch right now for various reasons
<cuddly_kittehs> Shizuka: because, if you take away guns, the true criminals will bring in guns from out of the usa.
<LadyCanary> D: NO SHIZU! D:
<Twilight> guns = good for children when their older
<Bronysith> Wrek: doesnt ever household in sweden have machine guns or something?
<Wrek> 05i say sure have a hunting rifle, a shotgun or revilver and pistol. but no heavy assault rifles.
<DJPON3> anyone see that amazing love is in bloom autotune so that it sounded like duskshine?
<Twilight> :|
<Vordox> Bronysith: Lol...
<Shizuka> 13prince-dari: if you give everyone a gun and train them in its use, it's also less likely
<killerpony7733> prince-dari That and paranoid twats cannot get their hands on them and many americans are like that
<Cypresswolf> :3 Assault weapons still legal in Texas - I <3 Texas!
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: yep
<TomatoPotato> Shizuka: You killed Wrek!? D:
<Shizuka> 13the moron that wants to shoot up the school is countered by a school ready to shoot back
<prince-dari> Shizuka: You can't deny that gun crime is way higher than it would be if they weren't so readily available.
<twilight_sprinkle> ^
<Twilight> Fuck it their good for children and grown ups
<Wrek> 05though if i were stupid enough to move to the US
<taoumi> actauly you don't need to have a license for long guns such as rifles and shotguns
<alexxm> the issue is keeping the gun locked away then
<Shizuka> 13it's the black market that makes them so available
<Wrek> 05id def get hold of a a proper sniper rifle
<taoumi> only for small fire arms liek pistols
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: You would :).
<TomatoPotato> I like Archie Bunker's method for airport security. You give everyone a gun on the plane to use as they see fit then they return them when they get off the flight.
<cuddly_kittehs> It is ok if you have locked away guns and licenses.
<DerpyMuffins> Since when did BState become a debating website?
<Vordox> Wrek: Aren't we too patriotic for Sweden already? :P
<brony90> it says "the stream starts on friday 4pm EDT" (newsletter)
<Twilight> its their fault killing them selfs
<LadyCanary> If you did come to the U.S. Wrek...well :3
<prince-dari> DerpyMuffins: Bullshit tends to spark debates
<Shizuka> 13and wimpy twits that think it'll be safe if no one has an equivalent defense against guns

<Twilight> she almost killed that bear
<DJPON3> Dont kill but hury
<prince-dari> There are always going to be crazy people in countries, if they can get guns, then you're just giving them better means to kill people.
<DJPON3> *hurt
<Shizuka> 13prince-dari: then give their targets the means to defend themselves, it's a deterrent
<brony90> when would you upload it?!
<Scootaway> 00,03MURRI-... wait...
<TheMaster> so don't let the crazies have guns, don't let those people ruin it for eveyrone else
<Wrek> 05sweden doesnt even have a gun law
<prince-dari> You might say you have better means to defend yourself, but that's shite, if someone pulls a gun on you, there is no way you're going to be able to gets yours out before you get shot
<Kandarihu> Yeah. The key is to make sure that the sane people are armed too.
<Wrek> 05casue we've never needed one
<Bronysith> Shizuka: http://imgur.com/mtxM8
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: and guns dont offer any defense, because criminals wont just run at you screaming with a gun
<Wrek> 05well malmö needs one
<Shizuka> 13if you're trained you would be
<Wrek> 05but thats about it

<prince-dari> Bullshit, they could be behind you
<Vordox> Wrek: It's the New York of Sweden. :P
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: And you're still alive? (/sarcasm)
<LadyCanary> Pew pew.
<Twilight> if crazy people dont have guns they uae their hands
<TheMaster> the guns are not for criminals, dari. Criminals would prefer nobody have guns. Criminals tend to be huge and intimidating. That all goes away when a 5' nothing woman has a revolver.
<Wrek> 05Everlasting_Joy: axe
<Shizuka> 13you're still ignoring the point
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, FlutterMEDIC. :)
<Twilight> *use
<Shizuka> 13it's a deterrent
<DerpyMuffins> Mods are arguing
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: My sarcastic point still stands.
<DJPON3> y u no FlutterSPY
<TomatoPotato> Shizuka: The point is GUNS ARE COMIN' OVER HERE AND TAKIN' R JERBS
<TheMaster> a 5 foot tall woman with a gun doesn't have to worry about a 6 foot 3 gangbanger
<Shizuka> 13if there are two people, one of them i'm not sure is armed or not, the other i'm certain is not, which one am i likely to shoot

<prince-dari> If it's a deterrent, why is gun crime so high?
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: *shrugs* :D
<Shizuka> 13because only outlaws have guns
<FlutterMEDIC> Twilight: so can't I
<TheMaster> because irresponsible people will always be irresponsible
<Twilight> early november squee
<cuddly_kittehs> I am sorry to say, but they can't compltely ban guns. I know we have clearly NEARLY breached our own orginal amndments. So....yah. Rember; if they take our guns and break the amendment, whos to say theres going to be no giant mob?
<DJPON3> crystal ponies????
<prince-dari> If that's the case, why is gun crime so low in UK?
<Wrek> 05its too late america
<Wrek> 05you got the guns in there already
<Shizuka> 13people are so damn scared of having the ability to defend themselves, and too damn stupid to train themselves

<Vordox> Wrek: "We must stop violence with guns" *Creates more guns* *Facepalm*
<Eli> I HATE GUNS! i still learn how to use them. you can never know
<TheMaster> why is free speech illegal in the UK? How do you plan to stop people from being arrested for posting on facebook?
<Dark_Horst> yeah, but the time of civil war is over
*twilight_sprinkle screams and shouts in Scootaway 's ear
<Dark_Horst> these gun laws are pretty much antique

<Wrek> 05no Shizuka
<TomatoPotato> Yeah, because bad guys really are afraid of someone else packing a gun.

<DJPON3> and I will be happeh
<LadyCanary> ...The...canary, Wrek? .///.

<Kandarihu> prince-dari, British criminals use baseball bats to do their dirty business.
<Everlasting_Joy> I have to go through a process to get a CCW permit, yet I can carry a gun in plain sight w/o a permit.
<MadSurge> The only guns I've seen around here are on cops. :I
<Vordox> OH OH
<Vordox> Wait!
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: the more people with guns, the more people that are brave enough to attack someone with a gun, it doesnt deter everyone
<DJPON3> dat gun
<prince-dari> Kandarihu: Mainly knives actually
<cuddly_kittehs> I dont care if the gun laws are old. Trust me, once you breech one amndment, it will get worse....
<killerpony7733> Wrek 44. mag with scope? that would be rather funny
<Bronysith> Laurayne: its called cavity
<Wrek> 05as for my sniper

<Wrek> 05a longsword whipserhead
<Laurayne> lmao

<Wrek> 05also i prefer no scope for handguns
<DJPON3> AKIMBO SHOTG- oh wait
<TheMaster> why do you need to lower the bar to criminals and irresponsible morons? Think about how many people in the u.s. have guns, do you think we're all shooting each other and themselves?
<Vordox> Wrek: I'll defend your back while you focus on sniping, Wrek :P
*Vordox swings around the two swords.

<LadyCanary> O_O

<Eli> Vordox: you... swing around a claymore wiht one hand?? hell you must be strong
<Twilight> name my gun fluttershy
<Kandarihu> My friends who live in the country are forced to shoot at coyotes more than humans.

<TheMaster> they went after religion dari, hardcore. Why would americans support that?
*DJPON3 why did I think this was a good iddea??? ;;A;;
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01You're welcome.
<Shizuka> 13voting obama into office thoroughly debunks that
<Wrek> 05the fuck is libertarian
<twilight_sprinkle> prince-dari: that and they just like sound loud, while providing almost no facts and twisting all the facts they do provide
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ran out of maid corsets?
<TheMaster> they're libertarians, most americans are statists
<LadyCanary> Murica, thing Wrek.

<Vordox> Wrek: Democratic :P
<TheMaster> why are you so afraid of responsibility?
<Laurayne> Thou Speakith The Truth Sir Pen!
<Alister> Mfw when you people don't even know what Libertarian is
<prince-dari> TheMaster: On the whole the younger generation would

<DJPON3> TheMaster Dat amazing username
<TheMaster> its about whether you think people are responsible enough to own guns. Apparently you don't
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl
<twilight_sprinkle> da :O
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, most Americans being statists... I wouldn't be sure about that.
<Vordox> Wrek: I would vote Ron Paul. :P
<alexxm> that might actually work
<cuddly_kittehs> .....did they hate on religion? *slightly displeased Christan* :<
<Twilight> womsn dont kill people
<Vordox> The only one with sense.
<taoumi> it's soem one who sais that goverment should let them d owhatever they want so long as they don't hurt others wrek
<Twilight> *woman
<twilight_sprinkle> people dont kill people ,pinkies kill people
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Would vote Paul, but he wasn't nominated :<
<TheMaster> They're statists when it comes to the government enforcing their ideals on other people usually
<Twilight> this is why some men are stupid
<Shizuka> 13cuddly_kittehs: only in as far as people using it for their benefit, misleading people
<Kandarihu> cuddly_kittehs, yes they did *another displeased Christian*
<Twilight> :[
<Wrek> 05guns dont kill people, people kill people. and monkeys do to (if they have a gun)
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03The horror, The HORROR :O
<DJPON3> I could kill you 10 ways with a fork and they arn't outlawed >_> <_<
<Eli> i stay to my opinion. they are biased
<Vordox> Wrek: Imagine Flies/Moqsuitos with Guns...
<TheMaster> irresponsible kill people and themselves. The solution is only giving guns to responsible people
<FlutterMEDIC> Speaking of Revolutionary War, who here is excited for Assassin's Creed 3?
<Twilight> thank you
<Laurayne> What Are The Movies This Week?
<cuddly_kittehs> Shizuka: mvm then. It has been used that way before. Why do you think the people of britian followed thier king? ;)
<pony_7018> i am
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, there are plenty of Americans who aren't like that.
<Wrek> 05Laurayne: says on the front page
<DJPON3> YEAH AC3
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: monkeys are dangerous to kill even without guns, they can be quite frightening if theres a lot of them
<Wrek> 05learn to check it
<LadyCanary> Not the monkeys ;3;
<Twilight> i wish they would show a pony episode
<prince-dari> Bullshit
<Shizuka> 13eeyup

<prince-dari> Foxes ate my rabbit
<taoumi> well english know what to do when guns are removed. stab the crap out of them
<prince-dari> So fuck that
<Twilight> but they dont :<
<TheMaster> Oh sure, I know. I'm libertarian myself, which is why I like this show
*DJPON3 unable to afford AC3 ;;;w;;;
<Shizuka> 13and then dari missed the point
<Alister> What's the next step ? outlawing training because people will get strong and merely have the POSSIBLITY to hurt people ?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And Obama's a socialist, which won't work in America unless you want a third-world America.
<Twilight> fucking foxes
<Wrek> 05now the fuck is libertarian
<TheMaster> oh wow, they got a guy whose as tall as washington

<DJPON3> JIMMYS HAVE BEEN RUSTLED
<twilight_sprinkle> this was tellers last episode
<Twilight> thelonepony:not much
<AJIsAwesome> Welcome back, thelonepony. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> notlry
<TheMaster> Libertarians are basically anti-state. They think government needs to be out of the way and basically just build roads and run the military ideally
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01One's a party that wants little government (and legal marijuana), and the other is an ideaology.
<DJPON3> lolwut
<Twilight> DGPON3: what?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*ideology
<TheMaster> socialists are the opposite, government highly involved in just about most all aspects of peoples lives.
<Everlasting_Joy> This music <3.
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: dat illusionism :3
<Wrek> 05thanks TheMaster
<TheMaster> noprob
<CCCP> whats this?
<Cypresswolf> That's a beautiful sight
<Wrek> 05i knew i could count on your literacy
<CCCP> hi
<Twilight> DJPON3: what?
<TheMaster> I'm just here to help
<Twilight> i spelled it wrong
<thelonepony> ohai CCCP :3
<Vordox> Wrek: Basically.. Individual democracy :P
<CCCP> hi thelonepony
<DJPON3> I want a airsoft AK-47
<TheMaster> i think all kids should learn how to handle guns
<DJPON3> Twilight: wat?
<cuddly_kittehs> Nittany_Discord: I would belive that the goverment balance with freedom is needed...
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy CCCP!
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai CCCP
<Eli> any americans here? are you for Romney or Obama?
<CCCP> hi Everlasting_Joy and Colt_Brovakiin
<DJPON3> Allos CCCP
<Twilight> Djpon3: wat?
<TheMaster> kids hardly have any responsbility. Guns teach responsibility to people. Make them shoot and clean them.
<CCCP> hi DJPON3
<Kandarihu> Eli, I'm for Romney
<MadSurge> CCCP! <3
<thelonepony> Eli: none right now
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03Airsoft guns... hurt >_<
<Alister> Criminals don't respect the law , DUH !
<Twilight> obama :|
<CCCP> MadSurge hi!
<DJPON3> Twilight What?
<Spectrum_Rush> Scoot-Scootalooo: tell me about it
<alexxm> night guys
<Twilight> obama = zecora
<Everlasting_Joy> Scoot-Scootalooo: Paintballs hurt more.
<twilight_sprinkle> whats the difference, if people Own guns
<Dark_Horst> saying that gun-free zone and shootings are related is pretty fucking stupid
<Everlasting_Joy> Nigh tnight alexxm!
<AJIsAwesome> Night, alexxm. :)
<thelonepony> Night alexxm :)
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03Don't een get me started on BB's...
<DJPON3> Twilight Dat logic
<Twilight> Djpon3:what
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm slightly Romney because he understands how to run a capitalist economy. I just hate his attitude.
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03even*
<CCCP> guns are still stupid and pointless to own i dont get why people "need" them
<Colt_Brovakiin> Goodnight alexxm :)
<TheMaster> at the end of the day, guns are equilizers.
<Dark_Horst> it's that gun free zones are usually areas with many, many people
<twilight_sprinkle> no-gun zone or not, if people are allowed to buy a gun, they can bring it anywhere
<TomatoPotato> Night alexxm !
<Shizuka> 13Dark_Horst: which means more targets
<cuddly_kittehs> Nittany_Discord: To a point, that is. Because, im still annoyed that when you vote, the votes arent what choose the presdient; The repersetive of your state vote. He can dismiss your collabertive votes at his/her lessure.
<Twilight> DJPON3:Thats right
<DerpyMuffins> Cya alexxm
<Wrek> 05oh look hes from IRA
<Dark_Horst> so that's why shootings happent here. becasue there are many fucking people
<Wrek> 05or was that NRA?
<DJPON3> Twilight o3o
<LadyCanary> NRA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01cuddly_kittehs: You mean the electoral college?
<Kandarihu> Nittany_Discord, have you seen him in the debates?
<Twilight> DJPON3: :D
<TheMaster> he was a former member of a gang
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yes Kandarihu.
<DJPON3> owo
<cuddly_kittehs> Nittany_Discord: Yes.
<Shizuka> 13if you want to shoot a bunch of people, and you have a choice between a "gun-free zone" where no one is armed, and a space where any number of people you aren't shooting could be armed, you're going to pick the gun free zone
<Shizuka> 13you are guaranteed to cause more damage
<TheMaster> ^
<cuddly_kittehs> Nittany_Discord: ;~; our teacher told us
<Twilight> DJPON3:wat?
<DJPON3> .-. wat
<DJPON3> BRB
<LadyCanary> ...Oh dang
<Twilight> wat?
<Dken2021> ouch
<twilight_sprinkle> "no gun zone" is pointless unless its enforced well. whats important is that people arent allowed to buy it
<SadisticPony> D:
<Dark_Horst> why am i suddenly lagging?
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: but the point is criminals. don't. care.
<LadyCanary> ....Oh my god.....
<TheMaster> though most criminals arn't so logical. The point is that people with guns are either responsible or irresponsible. Stop making it harder for responsible people to get guns
<Twilight> Nittany_Discord: hi
<cuddly_kittehs> twilight_sprinkle: i agree with you :P
<Dark_Horst> what did she say? i lagged over it
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Twilight.
<prince-dari> Well that's the government's fault for deciding that there should be 'gun free zones' when guns are legal
<Twilight> ello
<Shizuka> 13you are not allowed to buy a gun, oh well, i'm already going to break the law so i'm just going to get one anyway
<Dken2021> lali-ho Twilight
<Phase4> yeah, weapon regulation is a bit odd
<taoumi> horses
<Shizuka> 13you're only putting the innocent people at a disadvantage
<Alister> twilight_sprinkle: Have you ever heard of the prohibition ? people will get what they want
<Alister> ^
<Twilight> elllo Dken2021
<Phase4> you can't let everyone have guns, but at the same time you can't stop everyone from having them
<Twilight> *ello
<DJPON3> Back. Extreme paranoid self made me turn on all of my lights and check the house
<TheMaster> this is about responsibility. Stop making the people doing the right thing not able to defend themselves.
<Shizuka> 13(and yeah having just seen the war on drugs ep, this isn't much different)
<thelonepony> Ohai Alister :3
<Derpy_Hooves> :3
<Vordox> Accidental Deaths...
<Everlasting_Joy> 1 death a tragity, 1,000,000 is a statistic.
<Vordox> Wrek! I GOT A VIDEO FOR YOU!
*Nittany_Discord 11,01puts twilight in a gala dress
<Twilight> i wish pony episodes would come on but they wont :<
<thelonepony> Hi Derpy_Hooves :3
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: but this way non-hardened criminals wont have access to such easy murder . real criminals will ambush you anyway. of course, having no-gun zones that arent enforced well in a country that allows everyone to buy gunsis dumb
<Twilight> hi TheLonePony
<CCCP> Im not sure if making guns illeagle would help because then like drugs there might be a black market on them, ibut i dont know anyhthing about guns
<thelonepony> hi Twilight :3
<Vordox> Wrek: Seen the video of where the Police shoots his leg? :D
<TheMaster> there are of course a black market for guns
<Eli> more ppl have been killed with chairs? think about that very closely. BULLSHIT
<Shizuka> 13there already is a massive black market for guns
<Dken2021> forks?
<Colt_Brovakiin> Hai thelonepony because everyone is saying it :3
<LadyCanary> So....penn and teller dont like furries.
<TheMaster> where do you think criminals -get- guns?
<Alister> CCCP: It's not about safety , it's about the fundamenta right to ensure your own survival
<CCCP> Shizuka it would be bigger
<Shizuka> 13exactly
<Phase4> i reckon there should be some training, like getting a boat here in aus. 2 day course where they explain how to captin, safety equipment, signals and the like
<CCCP> Alister XD
<Wrek> 05need subtitles
<Laurayne> lmao Ahh Penn, You Waskwy Widdle Waskle
<LadyCanary> ...He's speaking JEWISH.
<thelonepony> Twilight: you didn't have to put caps to every Begging word to my name :P
<doctor_whooves127> ban legs lol
<DJPON3> more people have been MAULED by FERRETS then sharks. OUTLAW FERRETS
<cuddly_kittehs> I was taught responsiblity like evryone in my and my friends family; We recive a knife at age 11, and are allowed freedom to explore on our own, as long as we say where and why we are going somewhere. We get to hunt at age 16.... but i wont. Don't like shooting.
<LadyCanary> I CAN UNDERSTAND IT.
<TheMaster> children at school should have gun safety classes
<Twilight> i know TheLonePony
<Eli> i'm slowly starting to HATE that show
<thelonepony> Again :P
<CCCP> i must say i agree with the Amazing Athiest on this topic
<Dken2021> insane in the mainframe
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: because its very hard to tell who got them legally and who didnt. if guns were illegal for everyone, itd be obvious when someone got them from the black market, and like i said, it doesnt allow that much protection
<Vordox> Dken2021: Membrane*
<Alister> CCCP: > 2012 > Listen to fat whale > mfw
<Dken2021> I know what I said
<TheMaster> it'd be obvious, after the police are zipping up your body bag twilight_sparkle
<Vordox> BLAMING DUMB PEOPLE FOR USING THINGS IN A DUMB WAY!? Hell no!
*Dken2021 pouts
<Twilight> fuck
<CCCP> Alister i know but he somtimes actually has some good points somtimes
<Shizuka> 13that doesn't help at all though twilight_sprinkle, you have still created a world where criminals have hilariously easy access to guns and innocent citizens can't defend themselves at all
<TheMaster> ^
<Twilight> i hurt myself
<Everlasting_Joy> The 2nd protects the 1st.
<TheMaster> how are you going to defend yourself from a gang of thugs if you don't have a gun? They don't even need the gun if you're unarmed
<Alister> Shizuka: It's not even about safety , it's about the right to ensure your own survival
<TheMaster> they'll just beat you up
<Twilight> dat fake war
<prince-dari> The only reason criminals would have such easy access to guns is because of America's attitude towards guns
<Eli> i agree, that most laws against laws are usless. the thing that would work, is destroying all guns. but again, THAT is a multiple billion dollar industry
<Vordox> "Faith in america"
<TheMaster> criminals do not -need- guns if their victims are unarmed
<Shizuka> 13Eli: then criminals just start importing
<Bronysith> Eli: im not giving up my gun
<Wrek> 05hahaha
<prince-dari> Guns are illegal in the UK, you don't see people gunning down everyone here, because law abiding citizens don't have guns.
<TheMaster> stop thinking about the lowest denomination. Citizens need guns to defend themselves from both criminals and the government
<Bronysith> im not giving up my right to defend myself
<LadyCanary> MURICA
<twilight_sprinkle> Shizuka: but they already cant defend themselves properly, thats what im saying. the only thing legal guns allow is let everyone kill others. even for the deterrent purpose, the more people with guns there is, the more people that arent afraid of such hypothetical detterrent when they can ambuysh anyway
<Eli> ... yeah and i'm sad about this Bronysith
<Alchemist> just like many things, one would need to change people's mentality. somehow in many many countries burglars dont bring a tire iron with them let alone guns...
<Shizuka> 13correlation does not imply causality
<Twilight> ill brb
<Everlasting_Joy> ^
<Shizuka> 13britain is a very different society
<TheMaster> and yet you guys have riots all the time
<Shizuka> 13^
<LadyCanary> And then hot chicks with guns.
<MadSurge> prince-dari: What happened to using a door to keep people out of your house in America? :D
<DJPON3> wat naow
<Shizuka> 13over football
<prince-dari> > because of America's attitude towards guns
<DerpyMuffins> Shizuka : yup
<prince-dari> I already said that
<Eli> Bronysith: I just think guns are just NOT cool.
<CCCP> mfw people think that owning a a gun makes them safer
<Everlasting_Joy> "The what sir?" Best, answer, ever.
<TheMaster> when was the last time the united states had a major riot? are british people more riot prone?
<Alister> And then George Washington was all like wat ?
<Vordox> "The what sir" XD
<TheMaster> the last major U.S. riot was in 1992
<Bronysith> Eli: what? the right to protect yourself?
<TheMaster> the last major british riot was...a few months ago
<CCCP> a guns not gonna save you from a nuke :3
<MadSurge> ^

<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Oh god...
*Panda|Homework polygraph tests Nittany_Discord
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Besides, best Lie detector is....
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: Common Knowledge
<MadSurge> Shizuka: although in Penn and Teller: Fool Us, they're out of character and Teller is much more talkative
<LadyCanary> Nittany_Discord: YOU ARE NOT THE FATHER
<CriticKitten> Electrodermal skin conductance.

<Everlasting_Joy> I must take off, I have some stuff to take care of. Take care BroState!
<AJIsAwesome> Toph is best Lie Detector.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01LadyCanary: Phew.
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, Everlasting_Joy. :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I was scared there for a sec.
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: thats because you are the mother

<AJIsAwesome> WUT

<Bronysith> LadyCanary: yay..
<LadyCanary> OH GOD IT'S JUNIOR ALL OVER AGAIN
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Didn't even know I could become pregnant.
<Ryunosuke> o/
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<Wrek> 05this is a very itneresting episode
<MadSurge> LadyCanary: I hope it's not as boring though...
<TheMaster> why can't you just...ask him?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Do I have to be a chick now?
<Vordox> <---- That Divorce Actors
<Panda|Homework> Nittany_Discord, but you can. havent you seen that one movie with arnold shortsenegger?
<Sprite-Bot> HA-low
<TheMaster> that bitch be crazy
<Shizuka> 13personally i think the lie detector output has no correlation with whether you're lying or not
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have Panda|Homework. He took a serum.
<Eli> ...very trusting
<Dark_Horst> aaaaww, lookit how sad he looks
<Shizuka> 13BUT, it's a good way to intimidate you out of lying
<Vordox> <--- "Ask" < "Lie Detector"
<Megalomanic> They look so enthusiastic.
<Panda|Homework> Nittany_Discord but he got prego~
<CriticKitten> He's such a dumb guy. :D
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03Wait... guys can be pregnant? .... :3c
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Because of the serum.
<prince-dari> Polygraph tells whether you're stressed or not, is my take on it
<Panda|Homework> Nittany_Discord but he got prego~
<CriticKitten> If someone is polygraphing you before you've married, bitch be crazy, get out of there
<Wrek> 05if they have a womb Scoot-Scootalooo
<Dark_Horst> prince-dari: it doea. and that's all it does
<Lil_B> ehhmmm... Ben and Teller is kinda hit and miss I notice... they made a Great episode about PETA, but what I see here and saw during the Gun-Law previously I do not approve :/
<Dark_Horst> *does
<Laurayne> In my Mind, It Would be? Polygraph? You Want To See if Im Lieing? Fine, I Was Lieing, I Dont Love You Because I Didnt Know You Didnt Trust me. Cya
*Sprite-Bot flitters off to a dark corner
<Shizuka> 13yeah but generally if you're being subjected to a lie detector, of COURSE you're stressed
<TheMaster> it presumes you're a.not a sociopath. b.not nervous if someone asks if you're a murderer
<prince-dari> And quite a lot of people are stressed when they're lying, but then so do people who aren't depending on what they ask you
<Shizuka> 13but like i said i think it's more for intimidation, the guy administering the test can interpret the results any way he wants
<Dark_Horst> getting interrogated stresses you out
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But I never touched fertility serum.
<Dark_Horst> nothing else
<Panda|Homework> ... yeah... you can be telling the truth but be nervouse and fail a lie detector test... I know... ive tried.
<Shizuka> 13scare you into whatever he's aiming at
<Sprite-Bot> Hallo?
<AJIsAwesome> Yes?
<Vordox> Wrek: I want to check the Swedish general rate of Lie Detect beeps for ANY questions.
<LadyCanary> Brb, gonna go get ice cream cake \:3/
<AJIsAwesome> Lucky. :(
<Vordox> Wrek: We ARE one of the most "calm" people around :P
<Panda|Homework> hm...
<Vordox> Only beaten by Finnish and Norwegian
<Panda|Homework> that reminds me
<Panda|Homework> I have to go eat .__.
<Wrek> 05Vordox: do we even have polygraphs?
<Vordox> Wrek: Oh yeah we don't XD
<Sprite-Bot> W-wat are we watching ponies?
<CriticKitten> ...wow.
<TheMaster> the cops pressure and intimidate witnesses and suspects ALL the time
<Alchemist2> my chat derped and it says my name is already in use...
<TheMaster> never talk to a cop
<TheMaster> ever
<Eli> Sprite-Bot: some bullshit
<Dark_Horst> and that's how people with lie detectors manipulate the results into whatever the fuck they want them to be
<TheMaster> their job is to arrest someone. if you talk to a cop you are wrong
<Panda|Noms> TheMaster a little impossible in the ghetto >.>
<TheMaster> don't answer their questions, ask for a lawyer
<twilight_sprinkle> objection!
<Panda|Noms> they follow your ass
<TheMaster> just know your rights and don't let cops trick you into arresting you
<Alchemist2> thats bullshit too. You dont HAVE TO swear to god in court.
<Lil_B> All these fancy polygrafs... can't we just use some Monografs?
<TheMaster> don't let them search you illegally, tell them you don't give your consent, ask if you're being detained and on what charge and then invoke your 5th amendment if you're under arrest and then shut up
<CriticKitten> Yes you are :D
<Shizuka> 13Lil_B: no no that's just putting your initials on something
<StinkomanFan> Hiiii~
<CriticKitten> Lex Luthor! I knew he looked familiar
<Dark_Horst> "we're not emasuring nervousness" fuck you
<Wrek> 05the polygraph is as bad as holding a finger on someone feeling their pulse, and deciding if its a truth or lie depending on if you feel the pulse at the point of answer
<Laurayne> God I Love Penn xD
<Ryunosuke> RULE BROKE
<TheMaster> never talk to cops, its not their job to find truth, its their job to arrest you and put you in jail and they're very good at making people violate your own rights
<Ryunosuke> "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, unless its an STD"
<Ryunosuke> :p
<TheMaster> so don't talk to cops
<CriticKitten> wat
<twilight_sprinkle> yay job in Iran
<BaconMane> 0,5Hiai

<thelonepony> Hi BaconMane :)
<Wrek> 05they were then sued and decisted by the gov for rigths violations
<Sprite-Bot> Hallos BaconMane~
<Buytoast> ha
<CriticKitten> ....and we branded this guy a traitor? Oh fer.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They're commonplace here Wrek.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We need those laws.
<Wrek> 05i fire you cause you said this on face book
<CriticKitten> Poor guy. :/
<Vordox> <--- They found out about my dislike on my work through facebook
<twilight_sprinkle> i fire you and unfriend you from facebook! ;_;
<Lil_B> Companys over there just don't have the right to ask you personal Stuff, you HAVE the right to LIE IN THEIR FACE should they dare to ask you something private
<Alchemist2> wow, 1 am already... gotta go to bed. Goodnight everyone!
<Colt_Brovakiin> Goodbye Alchemist2
<twilight_sprinkle> bye Alchemist2
<Lil_B> Vordox There is a Universaty here that requieres you to have a Facebook account >.<
<TheMaster> if morons want to post information abou thtemselves on a public forum anyone can see they deserve to lose their job
<Lil_B> bye Alchemist2
<TheMaster> a job is not a right
<AJIsAwesome> bye, Alchemist2. :)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope those laws come about soon. I doubt a ban on assessment surveys will happen anytime soon, though.
<twilight_sprinkle> lol Lil_B
<TheMaster> learn self control and awareness of yourself
<Vordox> TheMaster: So... I cannot lose my aggression at home so I have to do it at work instead? SMART!
<Wrek> 05in fact acera care got decisted when they refused to keep company secrets public
<Wrek> 05oh and theyre a gov funded company
<StinkomanFan> :o
<TheMaster> no, you can say what you like in your own home. but don't post about it on the internet
<Wrek> 05gov funded companies are forced to keep secrets public
<StinkomanFan> SPY
<TheMaster> the same way you can't scream the N word in the middle of a store and not expect a reaction
<Lil_B> and there are multible companys in america that requier you to give them your Facebook Password... no prtoblem wqith me, it would just be a PW for a blank page, but WTF man
<TheMaster> the internet is NOT private. unless you set your facebook to totally private
<Vordox> TheMaster: So buck Free Speach and Free Will?
<CriticKitten> Jesus.
<TheMaster> free speech doesn't mean you're not responsible for it
<TheMaster> again, you can say the n word all the time. good luck getting a job for it
<CriticKitten> xD
<TheMaster> and nobody is stopping you from posting your drunken binges on facebook
<TheMaster> but your boss can see it
<TheMaster> and his customers can too
<Vordox> TheMaster: I wonder how that works in Sweden...
<Buytoast> ah yes
<Buytoast> the ass is power
<Vordox> At most we get a slap on the wrist =P
<taoumi> :D he's right
<Laurayne> No Comment....
<Wrek> 05how what works?
<Dark_Horst> yes i am
<Ryunosuke> DAMNIT PENN, STOP READIN GMY MIND
<Eli> they cought me
<StinkomanFan> Oh god that feels too good
<TheMaster> well i'm in america, and for the most part our values are about being responsible
<Vordox> Wrek: If company finds out about our opinion on stuff at work
<BaconMane> 0,5Oi
<CriticKitten> lol
<Vordox> Wrek: According to TheMaster You deserve to get kicked, and not improve the Work place.
*twilight_sprinkle calls 1-800-555-anal
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I wonder if class-action lawsuit waivers are legal in Sweden?
<Colt_Brovakiin> haha
<MadSurge> Tl;dr: the lie detector reads only your nervousness, and with training you will be able to fool it.
<TheMaster> facebook is a public thing, you need to be mindful that anyone can see it
<Wrek> 05legally, you cannot be fired for something you do on your spare time
<Wrek> 05in reality
<MadSurge> Oi BaconMane :)
<TheMaster> well then thats being in the UK
<Wrek> 05they do have the right to fire you anyways
<BaconMane> 0,5hihi
<Wrek> 05but if you are fired for it
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya BaconMane
<Wrek> 05you can go to the uhm
<Wrek> 05ombudsman for your area
<Vordox> Wrek: Or Union
<Wrek> 05which will look into your case and see if they violated your rights or not
<Lil_B> I thought it works like that: You think about the Number and the Number will get drawn on the Polygraf :P
<CriticKitten> HA. That's amazing.
<Wrek> 05no not union
<StinkomanFan> Yay!
<Sain> mfw RAWRity
<Wrek> 05thats a different thing
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Might have to quit Facebook if I get this data entry job.
<CriticKitten> It's that easy to fool? XD That's pathetic
<Sain> I WAVE TO YOU
<Wrek> 05spokesman is more like it
<StinkomanFan> Me gusta
<StinkomanFan> Yaaaay!
<StinkomanFan> :o
<TheMaster> daw
<StinkomanFan> :D
<Dark_Horst> that shit is tasty
<AJIsAwesome> WUT :D
<RAWRity> oh hey
<twilight_sprinkle> err ok
<RAWRity> polygraphs
<thelonepony> :D
<MadSurge> TOOT
<RAWRity> aka Bullshit
<TheMaster> again, cops are assholes. Don't talk to them
<Lil_B> we need James Rolfes - "You know whats Bullshit!"
<Vordox> Wrek: Well then you dont want to work at that place if you get fired for them doing something wrong
<thelonepony> so true TheMaster
<Dken2021> not all of them are
<TheMaster> know your rights, don't talk to them if you don't have to
<Vordox> Wrek: If the company cannot change for the better, what's he point of it's existance?
<RAWRity> TheMaster: depends on the cops
<TheMaster> cops want to arrest someone. if they can find a way to put you in jail they will
<Lil_B> Vordox leeching Money
<TheMaster> its in their interest to arrest people they suspect are guilty, its not for them to figure out if you are or not
<RAWRity> TheMaster: no, they do not
<CriticKitten> This poor guy.
<CCCP> Hi RAWRity
<TheMaster> cops have quotas. They need to arrest people to keep their job. Lawyers are for figuring guilt out
<Wrek> 05most cases they do RAWRity
<Megalomanic> He's so screwed.
<Wrek> 05atleast in the US
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: but you dont live in the us
<Buytoast> cops dont care
<Wrek> 05most errors over here are cause of incompetence
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi RAWRity.
<TheMaster> cops will arrest you if they think you're guiltty, and they will trick and intimidate you into confessing or incriminating yourself
<DerpyMuffins> This really isnt fair for the guy
<Cades> wb
<RAWRity> Wrek: I have friends and family in law enforcement. They do not go out to try and arrest people for the fun of it.
<Stormy> thanks
<twilight_sprinkle> back in my country cops were as dangerous as criminals, that i know, idk whaqt its like in usa
<Dark_Horst> in the US there are incidents of half a dozen cops emptying their revolver into a car at a checkpoint, becasue he didnt break fast enough for their taste
<TheMaster> watch an episode of cops, really look at how the cops do things
<RAWRity> yes, there are croooked cops, but they are not the majority in any way.
<Wrek> 05TheMaster didnt say for the fun of it RAWRity
<Dark_Horst> that'S the kind of cops you'll meet in the US
<RAWRity> Dark_Horst: again, no.
<CriticKitten> ....oh what an ass
<StinkomanFan> :o
<TheMaster> its not for fun, its their jobs on the line. Their interest is to arrest people when a crime has been commited. They -do not- care if you did it or not. They do not establish guilt, that is for your lawyer and the prosecution
<Lil_B> you know.. is iut actually illegal trying to bullshit the test?
<Dken2021> what test?
<RAWRity> TheMaster: it's in their interest to arrest the correct person.
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: its illegal to lie
<TheMaster> not really
<Buytoast> oh boy
<TheMaster> they will make you incriminate yourself
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: i mean if youre accused of something, itd be illegal to lie
<Buytoast> Cue Ball's goin all out
<Wrek> 05so look how he turned "i grabbed an arse when drunk" into "i fucked a hooekr in vegas" for the girlfriend
<DerpyMuffins> lol
<TheMaster> see that guy? he's a trainer pro at weedling confessions you don't have to get out of you
<TheMaster> thats what cops do
<CriticKitten> What an asshat.
<Wrek> 05and this
<Lil_B> twilight_sprinkle yeah, but they can't use graf as proof that you lied, that's whjat I ment
<GilDash> G'night everypony! :)
<twilight_sprinkle> well i dont believe any of these experiments, its pretty obvious that the lie detector doesnt do any good
<TheMaster> and they scream at you, in your face and do that for hours and hours at a time
<Wrek> 05this is true assholery
<Wrek> 05douchebaggery
<thelonepony> Night GilDash :)
<AJIsAwesome> Night, GilDash. :)
<Wrek> 05axe to head-able behaviour
<Buytoast> what?
<DerpyMuffins> Cya GilDash
<twilight_sprinkle> Lil_B: well yeah, i dont see how the polygraph can help, even if this show is anything but legit
<Colt_Brovakiin> Goodnight GilDash :)
<RAWRity> TheMaster: no, they don't. Some cops do that and are then reprimanded and have the testimony gained from that thrown out
<Buytoast> oi, i'd like to box this bastard's ears
<twilight_sprinkle> oh dem actors
<Lil_B> night GilDash :)
<Vordox> ....
<Vordox> Wow...
<Laurayne> Elmer Fudd xD
<StinkomanFan> What an asshat
<TheMaster> well she was a psycho anyway. Mike was saved from a bad relationship
<RAWRity> Police are not some large, blobulous force focused on making you miserable because they're lazy.
<DerpyMuffins> This is really fucked up
<CriticKitten> Ugh.
<Megalomanic> How do I get a job like that?
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: but theyre murricans, all urricans are bad from birth
<TheMaster> its not about making you or anyone miserable RAWRity. Its about arresting people. That is there job
<Laurayne> Howey Mandell from Hell xDD
<Laurayne> :D
<DerpyMuffins> Really?
<RAWRity> TheMaster: theri job is too investigate crimes.
<StinkomanFan> Oh
<StinkomanFan> :o
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: I know right? :S
<RainbowPie> Hey everyone
<TheMaster> if they don't arrest people then they're bad cops. Iits not about guilt. Cops are not lawyers. if they think you're guilty they are going to abuse your lack of knowledge about your rights to get you to confess or trick you into incriminating yourself
<Ryunosuke> poor teller
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, RainbowPie. :)
<Wrek> 05twilight_sprinkle: this show is more credible than you think
<CriticKitten> Folks, if your "significant other" asks you to take a polygraph....RUN.
<Wrek> 05its all about being critical to their presentation
<thelonepony> Hi RainbowPie :)
<oGriofa> Umm.. I didnt know you guise showed this stuff on here..
<TheMaster> they don't investigate. They respond to calls and then arrest who they suspect, suspect, of a crime. They will get you into a situation where they can arrest you if possible
<Vordox> THANK YOU PENN
<CriticKitten> It means they're fucking nutters and have trust issues
<Ryunosuke> oh mai
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh, is Bullshit on?
<thelonepony> Yes
<AJIsAwesome> oGriofa: We don't really do. Just this moment.
<RainbowPie> How are you AJIsAwesome and thelonepony
<Ryunosuke> ASoftFluffyThing, yes
<Dark_Horst> it is
<MadSurge> Yep
<ASoftFluffyThing> Yay
<Laurayne> He Doesnt Care. He Got Paid
<thelonepony> Hai ASoftFluffyThing :3
<Lil_B> CriticKitten or Trust Issue-them back :/
<TheMaster> watch a episdode of cops. They invade peoples homes if a door is open. Look through a car, browbeat someone to let them go through their pockets.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hai thelonepony
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: hardly, i dont believe any of their experiments, even if i cant prove it, but i often notice how they dont provide any facts to support their opinions, and when they do, they completely twist
<RAWRity> TheMaster: you forget something. Those lawyers? they base their case off of investigations DONE BY THE POLICE. Thus, it IS the police's job to do as much as possible to ensure that the person they charge is actually the one who commited the crime.
<oGriofa> AJIsAwesome: Yea i thought if i wanted porn and ponies id go to 4chan
<SadisticPony> Porn+Ponies=Me giving up on life.
<CriticKitten> Who knew that Mr Clean was such an asshole? ;_;
<Bronysith> SadisticPony: why?
<twilight_sprinkle> SadisticPony: r34, there is no escape
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: I did. Mr. Clean was also my middle school vice rincipal
<Laurayne> CriticKitten: I Knew xD
<Bronysith> hi RAWRity
<RAWRity> *principal
<Wrek> 05thats not the point of the show
<TheMaster> Not every arrest leads to a conviction. Any very often people have veyr poor notions of how the law works, their rights and have little access to proper defenses
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: because, some people want ponies to stay innocent
<Wrek> 05the point is to get you to think
<Dark_Horst> SadisticPony: stop being such a sissy
<Ryunosuke> I have something to say
<thelonepony> SadisticPony: R34 welcome to the internet
<TheMaster> and what I mean is that they weedle you out of your rights.
<oGriofa> Who is streaming?
<Eli> twilight_sprinkle: you think tehy are biased oo?
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: ahahahhaha, thats not happening
<Eli> too*
<Wrek> 05of course they are biased
<thelonepony> oGriofa: Wrek
<Wrek> 05they even admit to beign biased
<Ryunosuke> Comparing Penn and Tellar to say... Bill Nye, is akin to comparing Trixie to Twilight :)
<Shizuka> 13like i said before, they're both openly skeptic atheist libertarians
<TheMaster> They make you talk when you don't have to. violate your right to not being searched. The cops -want- to arrest people and obviously they do not have your interest at heart
<TheMaster> here, this looks like a good episode for this issue
<RainbowPie> my friend read a clopfic out loud to me one day, I can't look at rainbow dash, fluttershy or pinkie pie the same way again ...
<twilight_sprinkle> Wrek: im thinking, and im thinking theyre extremely biased. and ive heard about them admitting it, but i havent seen it yet, and an ep ago they said they were telling the truth on this show
<thelonepony> and hi oGriofa :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Still wonder if there's a piracy episode.
<Shizuka> 13nope
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli: ye
*Nittany_Discord 11,01trumpets
<AJIsAwesome> RainbowPie: That sucks.
<Eli> Wrek: you find everything you search for. and if it serves for a good show and you get rich for it, all the better
<TheMaster> cops are generally jerks and any randomly good cop is outweighted by the assholes pointing shotguns in the face of teenagers
<Dark_Horst> RainbowPie: and that is pretty damn stupid
<CCCP> I wish I could write with both hands
<AJIsAwesome> Dark_Horst: VERY stupid indeed.
<RAWRity> Wrek: and that would be fine if the poeple watching it did take this as an oppurtunity to think about preconcieved notions. Instead they use this show as a way to say "See, the other people are totally stupid."
<Laurayne> I Wish I Had A Big Burger
<Shizuka> 13burger? mmmm
<Dark_Horst> RainbowPie: sadly, not stupid on hsi part
<StinkomanFan> They do a special on Ghosts yet?
<RAWRity> Wrek: it's like the people who say Religion is evil because they watched Bill Maher's "Religilous"
<RainbowPie> Dark_Horst, Hows it stupid on my part?

<CriticKitten> LOL
<DerpyMuffins> Hey Reikim
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Enjoy.
<Lil_B> well, I already know that the american patten System is beyond broken
<RAWRity> Wrek: I agree. But "Religulous" is a movie that focuses on the extremists, and is then used by tumblr posters as evidence that all religious people are crazy and stupid.
<StinkomanFan> :o
<Shizuka> 13DUN DUN
<MadSurge> I hate Law and Order :D
<JRP> Centerlink why you stuff up
<Wrek> 05RAWRity: which makes said tumblr posters idiots
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Eh, stupid people are always stupid.
<twilight_sprinkle> this show always chooses to show the most extreme extremists, actors i suspect
<DerpyMuffins> Dat Teller
<RainbowPie> Dark_Horst: called having a good imagination, Its not my fault if i can picture the scene perfectly and i dont know about you but i for one dont want to remember ponies are porn

*Bronysith dusts Nittany_Discord and pours lemon pledge on Reikim

<TheMaster> how quickly would penn and teller be discredited if they were proven hacks? I doubt this isn't accurate
<CriticKitten> Oh god, Lars Larson.
<Eli2> did i just get kicked?
<TheMaster> they play to a niche audience, where is the incentive to lie?
<Bronysith> Eli2: most likely
<twilight_sprinkle> TheMaster: theyre already cancelled
<Dark_Horst> RainbowPie: i haven imagination too. i'm still able to see canon and "fanon" as two different things entirely. it's not hard
<TheMaster> if you suspect they're lieing, look it up
<RainbowPie> Dark_Horst: its not hard, just disturbing
<CriticKitten> If you arrest people, crime stops. It's magical. :D
<StinkomanFan> MAAAAAAAAAAAGIC
<Lil_B> yes, be Harsh onm crime, BUT WHEN YOU ARE HARSH ON CRIME, Than watch out that it hits the right people!
<CCCP> RAWRity their not all crazy, they just don't really except fact.
<Dark_Horst> people are making way too much of a deal out of porn. WAY too much
<Bronysith> its just porn
<killerpony7733> Dark_Horst Yeah but what can you expect?
<Wrek> 05ill show the porn episode afterwards
<Dark_Horst> it's just porn guys
<Bronysith> seriously
<killerpony7733> Oh boy wrek
<twilight_sprinkle> TheMaster: i could, maybe i will a bit later. but i dont need look anything up to see they dont provide enough facts adn avoid all the main problems with their claims
<Eli2> was just wondering. Wrek i think that came out wrong myself. i think the "organisations" that call themselves religions are evil. not all people in religions are evil.
<JRP> Shoo be do
<TheMaster> most of the people sent to prison these days are non violent drug offenders
<Dark_Horst> not terrotists
<Bronysith> its just porn, get over it, not that big a deal
<SadisticPony> Idk if i said my words wrong but porn is porn... i just dont care for pony porn.
<TheMaster> most prisoners are people who were caught with weed, non violent drug users
<CriticKitten> ...wat
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: almost nobody said anything..
<twilight_sprinkle> popelice
<killerpony7733> SadisticPony Then stop bringing it up cause bs main does not really like that topic

<mitamaking> hey
<Eli2> twilight_sprinkle: sure. i should create a brony skypee so you can reach me easily
<mitamaking> Oh god this show
<Shizuka> 13Nittany_Discord: 2010 i believe
<mitamaking> bye
<Reikim> What are you guys watching? (Is streamless)
<Ryunosuke> i think the root problem with the criminal justice system, is that our prison system is private corporations
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dken2021: the La Li Lu Le Lo? Metal Gear...:D
<TheMaster> they use prisoners are virtual slave labor now. Naturally there is no conflict of interest in such a system whatsoever. -sarcasmoff-
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli2: okay, wel ltil tomorrow then i guess :)
<Lil_B> yes... I think my point states... Be hard onn crime, but be very very sure that it goes against the right people
<Dken2021> Sketch_Toku_Brony dwarven greeting!
<Wrek> 05arent the prisons in the US private?
<Lil_B> there really isn't much more to saY ABOUT THIS
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't think so.
<Ryunosuke> wrek they are
<Shizuka> 13some are
<RAWRity> Wrek: some are
<Shizuka> 13not all
<Wrek> 05...but whyyyy
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Dken2021: ah i see lol metal gear came to my mind hearing it :D
<TheMaster> you know who gives the police the nice equipment they use to catch speeders and traffic violators? Oh right. The insurance companies.
<Reikim> Because capitalism, Wrek.
<Ryunosuke> because cost savings
<Shizuka> 13Wrek: means less out of taxes
<TheMaster> because people are dumb and don't pay attention
<TheMaster> and don't care
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01When did prisons become private?
<Wrek> 05but that means its a profit organization
<AVS619> how is everypony?
<CriticKitten> Teller would buy that for a dollar.
<Wrek> 05which encourage malpractice
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How would they make money?
<thelonepony> hi AVS619 Doing well and you? :)
<Ryunosuke> exactly wrek
<Shizuka> 13actually... i think i'd have to look into this
<Bronysith> and now they are talking about forensics...ill brb
<RAWRity> Nittany_Discord: put the prisoners to work
<TheMaster> the cops have a total conflict of interest, the states prosecution system has a conflict of interest, the prisons have conflict of interest. There is no way to win in the criminal justice system
<Panda|Noms> and im back, and now the subject is on jails XD
<Shizuka> 13my first instinct is the government pays a private prison to hold a criminal
<Wrek> 05only thign i can think of is if its a private company
<Wrek> 05but gov funded
<Shizuka> 13but that's not much better than the government running the prison itself
<Wrek> 05yeh
<CriticKitten> I'm pretty sure the US pays private prisons to hold prisoners.
<Ryunosuke> Nittany_Discord, that and I believe they get ... some money from the govt for keeping prisoners
<AVS619> thelonlypony: im doing well too
<Lil_B> I still think we should build a wall around the english coast and put everything above a certain crime level there
<Wrek> 05ratehr have the gov drive it directly
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: either that or Tax cuts/benefits
<Wrek> 05than a profit seekign company
<thelonepony> AVS619: In not Lonly :P
<Shizuka> 13i mean unless the private prison charges less than the cost for the government to run the prison itself
<Lil_B> he looks pissed off xD
<AVS619> yea soyy i messed
<TheMaster> in the past judges have been bribed by private juvanile halls to send children to their facilities despite not really having a reason to
<AVS619> sorry
<StinkomanFan> He's always pissed off
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Wrek: Totally agreed.
<CCCP> Superjail is how jail should be
<TheMaster> http://corruptauthority.com/pa-judge-convicted-in-juvenile-court-kickback-scheme/
<TheMaster> enjoy your criminal justice system
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some things should be private and others public.
<Shizuka> 13Private companies in the United States operate 264 correctional facilities, housing almost 99,000 adult convicts.[date missing][11] Companies operating such facilities include the Corrections Corporation of America, the GEO Group, Inc, and Community Education Centers. The GEO Group was formerly known as Wackenhut Securities.

<ASoftFluffyThing> Did chat derp?
<TheMaster> Ciavarella, 61, left the bench in disgrace two years ago after he and a second judge, Michael Conahan, were accused of using juvenile delinquents as pawns in a plot to get rich. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has dismissed 4,000 juvenile convictions issued by Ciavarella, saying he sentenced young offenders without regard for their constitutional rights.
<Bronysith> d
<Laurayne> Bronysith: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<TheMaster> 4000 kids, sent to jail for things they didn't do
<Lil_B> "That is ART not Science" I love that
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, private prisons isnt a good idea

<Dken2021> allo sonicdude558`
<Shizuka> 13wiki article doesn't go into much about *why* private prisons pop up
<Bronysith> others just happened to see it
<Eli2> twilight_sprinkle: don't worry :) i'm fuked tomorrow but i lke to sleep late anyways
<TheMaster> see? Cops do not care about your potential innocence.
<Reikim> They pop up because complicated reasons.
<TheMaster> cops want you to go to jail, that should scare you.
<TheMaster> Why would you help them?
<Reikim> Society. Economy. Politics. Probably a bunch of other factors.
<TheMaster> yay boobs
<Laurayne> HELLO!
<twilight_sprinkle> Eli2: lul :P well i just sent the request and it found you
<Laurayne> owo
<AVS619> lol wut
<twilight_sprinkle> dat science~
<Reikim> My guess is that it's cheaper for the govs to pay a private firm to run the prison.
<StinkomanFan> Mmmmmmm
<Ryunosuke> because boobies
<Dken2021> um...wha?
<MadSurge> Boobprints! :D
<killerpony7733> Wow i'm surprised no outcry about nakedness
<Dark_Horst> yes. they should start doing that
<oGriofa> I think everyone in my family has a strong hate for cops.
<StinkomanFan> Me Gusta
<oGriofa> BOOBS
<Lil_B> .... it's only science if you Document it Guys...
<Shizuka> 13that won't work because a) men, b) men have hair there
<CCCP> I totally want to become a crooked cop in the future
<Reikim> The prison probably absorbs some of the cost via prisoner labor. In theory, anyway.
<Shizuka> 13it would fuzz the result, no hair on your fingerprints
<TheMaster> because it helps lines peoples pockets if its not government run.
<Bronysith> CCCP: go to hell
<TheMaster> its corruption
<Eli2> twilight_sprinkle: good. sadly, i'm on the only computer in the house that doesn't have skype installed :) i'll accept you later
<DerpyMuffins> So boobprint?
<Laurayne> Can I Be An Official Government Boobie Examiner? ;w;

<Eli2> twilight_sprinkle: i don't like dolan.
<CriticKitten> Go directly to Jail, do not pass Go or collect $200
<Laurayne> I Promise Id Be very Thurough :3

<TheMaster> no conflict of interest at all -sarcasm-
<Reikim> Oh boy, copyright law.
<Brad[Laptop]> TheMaster he got a settlement after they stole 2 years of his life.
<Shizuka> 13the penalty for copyright infringement is higher than murder
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Copyright law is horrible.

<Reikim> We've had this discussion a bazillion times before.
<sonicdude558> SETH
<CriticKitten> I know about the doctor one. My father works in a private practice and can vouch for that, his pay is based on how many people he sees.
<sonicdude558> GOTO BED
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's abused all of the time, and the punishments are draconian at best.
<TheMaster> cops forced 3 teenagers, one of them -mentally retarded- to testify against themselves.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And there's no due process in a copyright violation claim.
<Reikim> Let's just back away slowly from the copyright law and move onto something a little less flame-prone.
<Reikim> Like, I dunno
<Reikim> Abortion
<StinkomanFan> :o
<CriticKitten> ...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Which helps make it easily abused for censorship.

<ASoftFluffyThing> IRC, why you derp so hard today?
<RAWRity> TheMaster: I'll remember that next time I'm assaulted and mugged.
<TheMaster> There is nothing to gain by talking to the police
<twilight_sprinkle> guns dont kill people, teller kills people
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No Laurayne. Not going to hurt you or dress you up.
<sonicdude558> Its time for me to do my annual barf
<Reikim> Someone ping me if anything interesting happens...

<Laurayne> Promise? >.>;;
*Bronysith vacuums Shizuka
<TheMaster> the cops don't stop crime, they only go after criminals. Hence why you could be assualted or mugged
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lolita Asuka?
<something> mlp s3 is coming out next november
<TheMaster> your best bet is to defend yourself and kill the guy(s) so you don't get charged with assault yourself
<Bronysith> dont care
<Ryunosuke> uh oh
<soulrider95> lol lololol this one
<twilight_sprinkle> heeey, this doesnt look like porn
<DashWithRainbows> Lies.

<ASoftFluffyThing> My god, is IRC being a douche today?
<Lyra|work> the bible?
<Lyra|work> i liek bullshit :3
<Bronysith> Anyone else think they added shit to the bible during translation?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Uh oh.
<TheMaster> as fictional as it is its a good book. Just not to think its literal
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Chat's going to love this.
<something> bullshit
<Lyra|work> they did, Bronysith
<twilight_sprinkle> ikr
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: hold me?
<Laurayne> uh Oh... I Feel A Religious War Comeing on... o.o
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hey Lyra|work.
<TheMaster> no actually. The bible has not really been tampered with
<Chrysalis> i lost my bible a long time ago
<Lil_B> ok, I'm of for... today... damnit, already 1:40am ... see you in maybe 10 hours
<Bronysith> Lyra|work: i think they added in the whole "no gays" during translation
<Lyra|work> Nittany_Discord, i love anything you sy, because its in a beautiful shade of aqua <3
<AVS619> i dont have a bible
<Reikim> ...What are you guys watching now?
<Shizuka> 13but anyway i think they're not using the KJV one cause when i followed along the quotes didn't match up quite perfectly
<oGriofa> How about we all just act like atheists for this one?
<MadSurge> Remember guys, the big guy talks to distract you from the little silent man!
<Lil_B> but I'll leave a Statemnent about the Bible anyway xD
<twilight_sprinkle> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqpuxdZN421r0ojhto1_250.gif
<Chrysalis> Bronysith they did ALOT of ommisions
<TheMaster> the Masorites were very, very, very, very, very, very hardcore about making sure the old testament was the same as it was originally written
<Lyra|work> also, without ace ventura, i wouldnt know how to spell beautiful
<Reikim> Religion, huh?
<Shizuka> 13i think this one is more for taking stabs at fundies
<StinkomanFan> :) I'm DEFINATELY going to hell for this but I REALLY don't give a toss.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thanks Lyra|work.
<Reikim> Oh luverly
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: hold me?
<Kandarihu> Oh boy. THIS again
<Ryunosuke> oh dear
<something> i love this show
<Shizuka> 13canary canary <3
<Wrek> 05TheMaster: there was apparently a translation error, and dont quote me on this caisue its probably wrong. that was from hebrew to latin/greek to english that turned young woman givign birth to virgin birth
<Chrysalis> StinkomanFan if you really didnt care
<Chrysalis> you wouldnt be going to hell
<Reikim> I'm permagone until this blows over.
<AVS619> lol this show is awesome
<LadyCanary> Shizu Shizu :333
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs Lyra` and holds Bronysith

<RAWRity> LadyCanary!!
<LadyCanary> PRAISE VAMPIAH JEBUS
*Reikim has had waaaaaaay too much religious debate in his life
<something> lol
<Lil_B> I hope they don't directly compare the old to the new testament
<Bronysith> i dont mind religion...i do mind WHEN PEOPLE SHOVE IT IN MY THROAT
<twilight_sprinkle> odd, i thougm ythbusters couldnt do that
<TheMaster> suprisingly enough. The catholic church takes the bible very seriously. Don't worry Wrek. any translation error is going to be just on synonym basis, not on content
<CriticKitten> Pizza!
<LadyCanary> RAWRity! :3
<Lyra`> pizzA <3
<Dken2021> pizza?
<something> pizza
<Lil_B> anyway, good night people :)
<LadyCanary> Religion: Pizza

<Ryunosuke> pizza
*Nittany_Discord 11,01gives Lyra` pizza
*Spectrum_Rush has pizza
<something> i love pizza
<Wrek> 05most likely
<Buytoast> ahaha
<Ryunosuke> oh shit
<Buytoast> oh boy
<Cypresswolf> Well, I guess that counts me out - grew up in church since before I could speak
<TheMaster> they did a lot of the important scholarly work. The bible is very well translated and has been for thousands of years.
<something> give me pizza
<Kandarihu> Well, it bothers me when atheists SHOVE THEIR DISBELIEF DOWN MY THROAT
<Buytoast> religious nutters time?
*Bronysith puts bacon bits on Lyra` s pizza
<Lyra`> just because i dont care doesnt mean i dont listen :3
<CriticKitten> Well this bible thing can't be all bad, if it's got pizza
*DerpyMuffins hates pizza
<TheMaster> the problem is nobody knows context
<Ryunosuke> inb4 jesus rode dinosaurs
<Dken2021> nighty Lil_B
<twilight_sprinkle> warm and fuzzy~
<Lyra`> wow, im fucking awesome as always :D
*Spectrum_Rush nothing good will come from this
*LadyCanary had delicious cake :3
*sonicdude558 yawns
<Lyra`> and im just typing things to watch my fingers move :D
<Shizuka> 13mmmm cake
*Lil_B hugs Dken2021 :)
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: have you seen the Young Justice episode that came out on iTunes before DC Nation was put on hold?
<TheMaster> I don't see why people get so hung up on whether the bible is literally true or not. Just read it as good literature
<sonicdude558> Why are we watching this?
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai sonicdude558
<LadyCanary> Why not?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lyra`: Taking funny stuff?
<AVS619> i think the bible was an amazing troll played on humanity
*Dken2021 returns the hug :D
<Ryunosuke> sonicdude558, because boobies
<Bronysith> sonicdude558: cause Wrek wants to
<TheMaster> the hebrews were originally polytheistic
<LadyCanary> sonicdude558: Dont like it? Dont fucking watch.
<Shizuka> 13TheMaster: point of the ep is people going around claiming it's literally true
<Lyra`> mmmmaybe
<Shizuka> 13point of the show is calling people like that out :3
<sonicdude558> dat os
<twilight_sprinkle> LadyCanary: calm down, he didnt say anything bad
<TheMaster> yahweh (god) is actually one of many semitic gods. Yahweh is actually the Thor of hebrew mythology
<LadyCanary> Dont think so, RAWRity
<TheMaster> so god is thor
<something> im died
<Cypresswolf> I find most religious debates interesting - I gain a bit of new understanding listening to the different viewpoints
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: he was being an ass
<Kandarihu> You claim you're only going after fundies, but the level of ridicule the basics of our faith face render anyone who isn't a total atheist a fundie.
<something> im a ghost
<Laurayne> http://www.lolbrary.com/post/12798/delayed-reaction/
<Ryunosuke> oh here we go
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: go watch it, So I can talk about how much I hate Miss Martian.
<Lyra`> LadyCanary, i will huggle the soul out of you if you dont chill babe
<Wrek> 05dont insult me by callign me an atheist
<TheMaster> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh
<LadyCanary> RAWRity: Shes being a hoe, again?!
<Ryunosuke> that snake hat
<Wrek> 05i dont wanna be associated with bandwagoning pricks
<something> lol
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: worse.
<Ryunosuke> SNAKES ON A HEAD
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: he only asked why we're watching this. which is what a lot of people are wondering, its a highly flamable subject
<TheMaster> here you go, yahweh is one of a pantheon of semitic gods.
<soulrider95> Wrek: lol so true
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01TheMaster: No non-image links during stream.
<killerpony7733> Wrek Yeah i honestly hate that.
<TheMaster> oh sorry
<twilight_sprinkle> god creates adamtehduck
<LadyCanary> Im tired of these monkey fighting snakes on this monday to friday head
<Shizuka> 13no no guy, god gives him a "help-meet"
<StinkomanFan> ...?
<Shizuka> 13i'm still stumped what that's supposed to me
<Shizuka> 13mean rather
<Ryunosuke> wat?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Huh?
<Lyra`> wait! hold up.
<StinkomanFan> ...Buh?
*LadyCanary places her head on Wrek's shoulder.
<something> just saying i hate black pll
<TheMaster> Despite the bible's story, according to which the Israelites originated from Mespotamia via slavery in Egypt, the evidence indicates that they were native to Canaan.[1] Yahweh, however, was not a Canaanite god, and modern scholars see him originating in Edom, the region south of Judah.[2][3] The goddess Asherah may have been Yahweh's consort in the earliest period. Originally the main god of the Iron Age kingdoms of Isr
<TheMaster> gah
<Lyra`> did LadyCanary call me a hoe?
<TheMaster> way to long
<Shizuka> 13serious too, pull out your bibles and look when god creates eve, he says she's a "help-meet"
<Bronysith> God bans Gay sex...Male Gspot in rectum lol
<MadSurge> Wrek: you and me, pal. "Agnostic" is better
<Lyra`> oh, it is on!
*Lyra` catfight
<LadyCanary> D: Good heavens no, Lyra`!!!
<Shizuka> 13you cannot catfight with canary
<DerpyMuffins> Wasnt Jesus jewsih?
<MadSurge> Bronysith: God likes to troll us
<something> yes
<DerpyMuffins> Jewish
<Shizuka> 13she ist under the vivi-shizu peace treaty~
<DeadpoolDash> BIBLE FIGHT!!!
<thelonepony> eeyup
<TheMaster> Despite the bible's story, according to which the Israelites originated from Mespotamia via slavery in Egypt, the evidence indicates that they were native to Canaan.
<AVS619> lol
<Lyra`> not even if mud and or jellow is invovled? Shizuka?
<Ryunosuke> uh oh
<LadyCanary> Oh my god dat swag
<something> lol
<Bronysith> "I GIVE YOU freewill, so use it EXACTLY as i command you to"
<StinkomanFan> ELVIS! WOOOOOO
<LadyCanary> I dont fight dirty like that Lyra` ^^"
<something> swag swag swag
<TheMaster> Elvis is jesus
<TheMaster> makes sense
<MadSurge> Shizuka: the most adorable peace treaty ever <3
<CriticKitten> See, but that's what the Bible was trying to do: tell stories. Parables are VERY common literary tools in the Bible used to indicate proper ways of behavior. A lot of them aren't meant to be literal.
<prince-dari> Oh dear, religion argument?
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, ever heard of such a thing as responsibility?
<twilight_sprinkle> false, Roger Federer is the king of kings
<Wrek> 05you can blame me for that dari
<Lyra`> no, but i do, LadyCanary, i promise that i can make you filthy`
<Kandarihu> How about moderation?
<Wrek> 05since i couldnt show a movie
<StinkomanFan> ...I like Elvis :)
<Wrek> 05i kept coing
<Wrek> 05g*
<MadSurge> prince-dari: yeeeeep
<Wrek> 05:3
<Ryunosuke> Elvis is dead? NOOOOOOOOOOOO
<prince-dari> Ahh, is it a relgion Bullshit ep?
<Ryunosuke> :)
<LadyCanary> No thanks, Lyra` ^^ Im god.
<CCCP> Why do people get so angry during religious arguments?
<Wrek> 05eeyup
<AVS619> Elvis is alive and so is tupac
<MadSurge> prince-dari: yesh :D
<prince-dari> Hah
<Shizuka> 13CriticKitten: i think i'm going to have to keep reading later cause.. at least as far as genesis goes, there's not much morality there other than "don't kill your brother or i'll kill the earth mmkay?"
*Lyra` throws spaghetti at LadyCanary
<Bronysith> AHAHHAHAHAHA
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: you're god?
*RAWRity bows
<TheMaster> CCCP people take religion seriously because they put a lot of their identity into being religious
<LadyCanary> No no no RAWRity O_O
<Bronysith> RAWRity: new church?
<LadyCanary> Im just a bird!!!
<something> it look good
*LadyCanary flails
<TheMaster> when you talk to them about religion and disagree you're basically attacking their identity
<CriticKitten> Shizu: I didn't say it was GOOD morality. God in the Old Testament is a total wanker.
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: dat canon now
<Shizuka> 13:3
<Chrysalis> probably the one with paprika
<Lyra`> a bird with spaghetti on her :3
<Kandarihu> CCCP, because it tends to involve atheists ridiculing and denegrating something which we Christians value higher than our very lives.
<LadyCanary> I meant to say Im good!!!
<Chrysalis> cause paprika is badass
<TheMaster> "just a little"
<MadSurge> Shizuka: the Old Testament's God is a dick :|
<Wrek> 05my guess is also paprika
<Buytoast> POSSIBLE
<LadyCanary> Not god!!! GOOD!
<Shizuka> 13does he get more into the "i'm a good god" in new?
<Buytoast> AHAHA
<sonicdude558> FarFetch'd is ok Pokemon
<StinkomanFan> ...Did they just defend The bible? :O
<LadyCanary> Why not cinnamon, Wrek
<RAWRity> Alright. Moderator 4 is gonna have LadyCanary ascending into godhood.
<AVS619> you would need a big boat
<twilight_sprinkle> no shit sherlock
<MadSurge> Shizuka: yes, surprisingly
*Shizuka 13is still ded in that universe :<
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Consider the Book of Job. In which God makes a deal with the Devil and royally fucks over the entire life of one of his most loyal followers just to test his faith.
<LadyCanary> ...Im okay with THAT RAWRity. xDDD
<Ryunosuke> where's the velociraptors?
<twilight_sprinkle> the point is magic though
<CriticKitten> Shizu: God is an asshat.
<Dark_Horst> yes. every predator and prey species of the world. take two fo em. keep em alive ona fucking boat
<CCCP> Kandarihu that's a little bit of generalizing
<Wrek> 05RAPTOR JESUS IS MY LORD
<Cypresswolf> Where's the unicorn?
<LadyCanary> Shizuka, that means I can bring you back to life \:3/
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3rcj64#by=ad
<Shizuka> 13:O
<Lyra`> maybe only the animals from that continent
<TheMaster> CriticKitten. Job is a morality tale. Satan is -not- the devil.
<Dark_Horst> also, keep em from eating each other. good luck
<Shizuka> 13DO IT DO IT DO IT
<RAWRity> Shizuka: I'll have you live on as a red-haired constellation in the sky
<Lyra`> or that region of the world
<sonicdude558> DO IT
<LadyCanary> Flying spaghetti monster all day erryday
<TheMaster> satan is actually a common heavenly lawyer figure. Not the devil invented by modern day christianity.
<MadSurge> LadyCanary: :D
<TheMaster> theres no devil or hell in judiasm
<TheMaster> no such thing
<RAWRity> LadyCanary: damn Pastafarians
<CriticKitten> Shizu: Yeah, New Testament God apparently started taking his happy pills because all of a sudden he loves everyone
<Lyra`> where there is only like, 100 types of animals
<Ryunosuke> wat?
<TheMaster> its a myth invented to scare children and people who don't think about theology very hard
<LadyCanary> But seriously, I meant to say good, not god ^^"
<oGriofa> h
<Kandarihu> Old covenant vs new covenant guys
<RAWRity> CriticKitten: to paraphrase Lewis Black, the Old Testament was meant to scare the Jews into calming their shit.
<TheMaster> seriously. If there was a devil, apart from god with his own power and designs...how is god omnipotent?
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3p5ek4/
<StinkomanFan> Spoilers: FLUTTERSHY MEANS NOAH
<CriticKitten> TheMaster: The effect is the same. God screws his follower for basically no reason except to fuck with him. :P
<Shizuka> 13see, that's a much better story
<Lyra`> we all know LadyCanary has a bigger ego than Lyra`
<StinkomanFan> FLUTTERSHY IS NOAH!
<Dken2021> Bronysith what? no good guy lucifer?
<LadyCanary> Jesus went sailing?
<TheMaster> lots of people have a problem with job. I actually like it myself
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/Ct6/
<Laurayne> http://www.lolbrary.com/post/12739/hesus-shoe-repair/
<LadyCanary> D: E-ego, Lyra`? Good heavens no.
<something> is that blood
<RAWRity> TheMaster: the Devil exists according to God's plan (as far as I've been told), and is the ultimate "necessary evil" used to test humanity.
<LadyCanary> I dont think I have an ego.
<TheMaster> the point of job you're suppose to take away is that bad things just sometimes happen. You're not suppose to question god.
<sonicdude558> Jose!
<Lyra`> see, youre talking about youre home already
<Wrek> 05that girl remidns me of you LadyCanary :<
<Chrysalis> i dont think elvis did drugs
<Wrek> 05:|
<Wrek> 05*
<Ryunosuke> that has been proven, but not in the way that most people think
<prince-dari> I heard that they mistranslated 'red sea'
<LadyCanary> ? What girl, Wrek?
<Chrysalis> Wrek thats LadyCanary :O
<something> :|
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, God has to respect the free will of the people he created. That doesn't stop him from giving people warnings not to do certain things.
<Buytoast> when did sarah silverman revert to a child?
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Yep! Old Testament God is a vengeful asshole, New Testament God is a hippy. I think at some point, God developed MPD.
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: everyone has an ego, but not everyone has egos the size of kenye...
<prince-dari> It was meant to be 'reed sea' or something.
<CCCP> Chrysalis lol
<Wrek> 05check stream LadyCanary :o
<Mega_Milk> LadyCanary: You got on TV? Nice.
<TheMaster> the only modern take on the devil is from the last chapter of the new testament. A feverdream which, is at best a allegory for the persecution of the roman empire at the time
<StinkomanFan> So these guys ARE defending not only the bible but the scientests? Wow!
<prince-dari> But when they translated it from the Hebrew they got it wrong or something.
<LadyCanary> Im watching stream Wrek. The lady passed quickly.
<Cypresswolf> Exodus- great story
<Lyra`> because god is a DICK
<LadyCanary> Or WeSker, Bronysith
<CriticKitten> Egypt dun goofed
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: i havent played that resident evil...
<TheMaster> When jesus talks about hell in the gospel he's using a metaphor for a common burning ground for garbage. Gehenna. its a metaphor, not a literal place
<StinkomanFan> :o
<something> awsome
<Lyra`> god hates fish
<LadyCanary> SCREAAAAAAM BLOODY GOOOOOOOOOOORE

<RAWRity> I'm waiting for them to get to the story of Job
<AVS619> FIRE
<Kandarihu> Lyra`, God doesn't hate his creations.
<something> fire bad
<CCCP> The bible would be better if it had dinosaurs
<AVS619> fire good
<LadyCanary> O_O
<Lyra`> god hates first born children
<TheMaster> Job isn't so bad. I like it. Its next to my absolute favorite book of the bible

<Wrek> 05that chat is bashing religion rightnow
<Wrek> 05atleast most of you are
<TheMaster> Look at it as just morality stories and a groups story about themselves
<TheMaster> I'm not
<RAWRity> just saying, Job's a pretty good summary of God being a dick for no adequately satisfying reason
<DerpyMuffins> I havent said a thing
<Wrek> 05when the show is only bring ing up some facts and interpetations
<AVS619> idgaf about religion
<CriticKitten> Mer?
<twilight_sprinkle> im not bashing religion, its too easy
<Dken2021> CriticKitten God was a very vengeful god in the old testament, but he was more loving in the new
<Wrek> 05why cant ychat act liek the episode?
<Buytoast> agnostic master race
<TheMaster> I'm comfortable enough to say its all not true, but I find theology and religion fascinating
<StinkomanFan> I'm a good christian but even I can laugh about it.

<Dark_Horst> now parting a sea. THAT seems unliely
<Ryunosuke> at MOST it takes 2-3 months to walk from cairo to jerusalum
<TheMaster> red/reed in english, not ancient hebrew
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01How is that bashing Wrek?
<CriticKitten> I'm not bashing Christianity. O.o I'm pointing out that the Bible portrays two versions of God, one of whom is a total asswipe, and that's sort of nonsensical. I actually respect the concepts and ideals of Christianity, though I don't like the church itself.
<Rex_Ivan> wrek that WAS a pretty big desert :P
<prince-dari> Called the reed thing
<prince-dari> :P
<MadSurge> Wrek: the plagues though were kind of an overkill.
<Lyra`> i ruck marched 100 miles since ive been in the army.
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35fzze/
*sonicdude558 barfs on Wrek
<Wrek> 05true
<RAWRity> CriticKitten more or less stated my stance on religion
<Lyra`> in less than six months
<CriticKitten> "kind of" ._.
<Shizuka> 13uh penn we did
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/Dfv/
<Shizuka> 13i mean i was four but
<TheMaster> well heres the thing. Christianity and Judiasm are different religions. The new testament (mostly paul) makes the argument that you don't need to be jewish to be saved.
<Buytoast> ah, the illustrated children's bible
<LadyCanary> JEEEEEEEESUS
<twilight_sprinkle> btw prince-dari do you have any idea when you will stream heroes?
<Shizuka> 13we heard the first born thing
<prince-dari> Not srue
<twilight_sprinkle> hm ok
<CriticKitten> "Jesus thing"
<Mega_Milk> Lyra`: I RAN more than that in raiders! >:3
<twilight_sprinkle> lawl
<Ryunosuke> Life of Brian
<Ryunosuke> :)
*twilight_sprinkle does the jesus thing~
<TheMaster> Judiasm as a religion is a religion of purity and atonement for sins.
<StinkomanFan> NEW TESTAMET: CANON
<MadSurge> Life of Brian is awesome :D
<CriticKitten> Yes, he did.
<Dark_Horst> i think jesus existed. i also think that the stories about him are obscenely exaggerated. also made up by his followers
<Bronysith> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/of0/
<Colt_Brovakiin> Ryunosuke: I love that movie :3
<thelonepony> Ohai Mega_Milk :3
<RAWRity> I learned about the Ten Plagues from the Rugrats passover episode.
<LadyCanary> ^
<StinkomanFan> ^^
<Mega_Milk> thelonepony: Sup.
<LadyCanary> Awesome RAWRity.
<Shizuka> 13oh yeah that episode
<Ryunosuke> oh then there was history of the world
<LadyCanary> I learned about it from...well being Jewish.
<Shizuka> 13why aren't any of us streaming rugrats
<ASoftFluffyThing> I learned about it from The Prince of Egypt movie
<LadyCanary> ^^
<Dken2021> RAWRity but...didin't that covered Hannakah?
<Ryunosuke> Hey Josephus
<RAWRity> Shizuka: because god is dead
<Lyra`> hesus
<LadyCanary> YES SHIZUKA. YES. DO IT <3
<twilight_sprinkle> all hail da jesus
<TheMaster> you should just read the bible
<Dark_Horst> in the end, jesus was probably just another random carpenter. jsut happened to be a little more neighbourly
<LadyCanary> You dont fuck with the Jesus.
<CriticKitten> Were the stories recorded about him accurate? Eh. Up to speculation. But I find it pointless to speculate that the foundation of the religion is based on a fake person, that sorta seems....pointless to even consider.
<Dark_Horst> none of that miracle gunk
<Cypresswolf> CCCP: Job's Behemoth - starts at Job 41:15
<RAWRity> Dken2021: they did Chanukkah too

<CCCP> Kandarihu yus very
<LadyCanary> D:
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03Jebus :O
<TheMaster> do you know how many people have spent thousands of years studying the thing? and now nobody cares.
<something> lol
<CriticKitten> Maybe he was taking a nap
<Kandarihu> CCCP, why?
<DeadpoolDash> Optimus Prime has resurrected way more times
<Mega_Milk> Scoot-Scootalooo: Scoots! =D

<CCCP> Kandarihu because I'm obsessed with eyes they are the best feature in human beings
<thelonepony> Hi Scoot-Scootalooo :)
<Cypresswolf> Jesus looked unremarkle as a man - not as most artworks or commonly thought features would have you believe
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya Scoot-Scootalooo
<Lyra`> Wrek, LadyCanary, Stahp! pls.

<twilight_sprinkle> i thought the whole basis of the bible was magic, whats the point of arguing with magic
<Wrek> 05please tell me why
<CriticKitten> IT ALL FITS TOGETHER
<ASoftFluffyThing> Uh oh
<TheMaster> The council of Nicea invented the bible
<Kandarihu> Scoot-Scootalooo, lol
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lol Scoot-Scootalooo

<thelonepony> lol Scoot-Scootalooo
<Reikim> This room is basically dead isn't it.
<something> let go wrek
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, they picked out which books comprised the bible.
<CCCP> Scoot-Scootaloo what's wrong with that?
<TheMaster> Council Of Nicea was a bit more important than a committee
<something> kick me wrek
<Mega_Milk> 6
<Wrek> 05Scoot-Scootalooo: im a socio-democrat. something: you still havent told me why you hate me.
<Mega_Milk> ^
<RAWRity> Hey, who here likes Bugs Bunny?
<sonicdude558> lol the context of that kick is funneh
<Wrek> 05fuck off guys
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03I love butting in sometimes~
<Wrek> 05im trying to talk to him
<Cypresswolf> Where are the 10 Commandments located? Exodus?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk, hohmygawd, I'm not pregnant. If I were, I'd tell you directly. But since I'm not (and don't plan on it till I'm married), I have no say in it
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dresses something as a maid

<twilight_sprinkle> well Ryunosuke , when a man and pavement love each other very much
<Lyra`> come at me wrek!

<something> i hate all black pll and u wrek
<Chrysalis> inb4 gangnam style soon becomes best selling
<Lyra`> so we can hug :D
<ASoftFluffyThing> Cypresswolf, I believe so. Been a while since I read the bible
<TheMaster> and the founding fathers were not christians
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Thanks Bronysith. You make a great maid, and a great-looking one too.
<Wrek> 05please explain why you hate me
<CriticKitten> Don't do bad stuff
<Reikim> (Just a quick note...he probably came in to say that just to piss you off and is not going to respond.)
<StinkomanFan> It's a frigging statue!
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, yes they were.
<Wrek> 05without interruption this time
<Lyra`> or~ i could just hug LadyCanary
<TheMaster> most of the important founding fathers were deists
<Bronysith> Nittany_Discord: thanks Aniki
*Lyra` offers LadyCanary a hug
*Mega_Milk kills steal murders theft takes lives
<sonicdude558> What about SaxyJanitor?
*CriticKitten knew several of them off the top of his head.
<Dark_Horst> how to follow the ten commandments: dont be an asshole. all you need to know
<StinkomanFan> We STILL follow them, even if they're religious!
*LadyCanary gives Lyra` a hug ^_^
<Shizuka> 13dammit i was busy typing out from memory...
<CriticKitten> ....yeah, no it's not
<Kandarihu> They were better Christians than our current generation.
<Lyra`> <3
<Shizuka> 13probably got seven i'm sure
<twilight_sprinkle> YOU AINT GOT NO PANCAKE MIX
<LadyCanary> ^
<TheMaster> the founding fathers that established this country were deists, olden day versions of athiests
<StinkomanFan> ...The hells a graven image?
<Ryunosuke> the 10 commandments can be summed up in one sentence, from Bhuddism. basically: Do unto others as you would have done unto you
<RAWRity> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc1g212J8f1qezg8qo1_1280.jpg
<Lyra`> you bible and you faith are important
<CriticKitten> ELVIS DIDN'T DO NO DRUUUUGS
<Chrysalis> didnt do no DRUUUUUGS
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, no they weren't.
<TheMaster> they were diests. Thomas Jefferson cut out every supernatural aspect of the bible.
<TheMaster> look up the jefferson bible
<sonicdude558> inb4 DRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGS
<Wrek> 05thanks Scoot-Scootalooo, thanks Shizuka. you got him to shut up. really helpful
<something> u suck wrek i hate admins
<Wrek> 05next time dont kick my targets
<sonicdude558> oh no a troll
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03I heard somewhere that Moses took shrooms before writing the 10 commandments
<Kandarihu> Do you know what Divine Providence is?
<Shizuka> 13i don't think he's here to talk wrek .-.
<Wrek> 05ah finally
<CCCP> Christianity really helped alot in advancing our technology :p
<Cypresswolf> Steal, Lie, Adultary, False Gods, Honor Father & Mother, Covet....thats all I remember
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh boy.
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03Nah, he's a hamrless little non MLG~
<Wrek> 05so something: you have yet to give me a proper reason
<Shizuka> 13anyway StinkomanFan i think it's related to the golden calf
<TheMaster> In the 1820s congress created the treaty of tripoli. They firmly rejected the idea that they were a christian nation
<ASoftFluffyThing> I smell a ban
<TheMaster> 1820
<CriticKitten> Actually there were fifteen, but then Mel Brooks dropped the third tablet
<Ryunosuke> "These 15 commandments..... These 10 commandments!"
<CriticKitten> Ryun: /)
<something> k
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Maybe we shouldn't stream sensitive material anymore :./
<StinkomanFan> :s
<sonicdude558> me too ASoftFluffyThing
<Shizuka> 13these.. FIVE FIVE COMMANDMENTS
<LadyCanary> Oh, the bible.
<TheMaster> controversy isn't bad
<Shizuka> 13crack..
<something> im high 6_9
<Chrysalis> these 15 commandments
<Shizuka> 13umm ... THIS ONE COMMANDMENT, THOU SHALT CARVE COMMANDMENTS ON BETTER STONE
<Cypresswolf> Ryunosuke: :D That scene is timeless
*Chrysalis crash
<TheMaster> I don't like these arguments, its stupid and ignores the obvious problem
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03Nittany_Discord: But that will run me out of business :O
<Chrysalis> 10, 10 commandments
<TheMaster> Paul already settled htis
<LadyCanary> Commandment number 1: Shut the hell up
<Mega_Milk> Shizuka: tHOU SHALT FIND A PIECE OF PAPER.
<Shizuka> 13StinkomanFan: sec i'll look it up
<CriticKitten> xD
<Shizuka> 13used to know it
<LadyCanary> Comandment number 2: THERES NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT THE SON
*Chrysalis is shamed
<LadyCanary> sun*
<sonicdude558> right Nittany_Discord, I come here for anime, not this kind of stuff
<TheMaster> all of these parts are from the old testament. Paul wrote that you didn't need to be jewish to be a christian, hence the argument only applies to jews.
<Wrek> 05something: final chance~ explain why you hate me. or i will take it as you dont hate me
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lolol LadyCanary
<Kandarihu> Where do you even see Christians advocating any of these in modern society?
<Spectrum_Rush> I prefer this one Commandment, Keep thy religon to thy self
<Shizuka> 13Kandarihu: fundies
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03Commandment number 3: There are no more Jolly ranchers, they're all gone!
<TheMaster> this argument was settled IN THE BIBLE
<something> wrek u r mean
<Darf14> err.... I sense a lot of angry Die Hard Christians..... I better hide
<CriticKitten> The first commandment is that you don't talk about the first commandment
<Wrek> 05ok so I am mean
<Wrek> 05what else?
<TheMaster> read paul's letters to eveyrone
<Freefall29> hello everypony
<Chrysalis> they do that with a quran
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, what fundies?
<something> ur dum
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hi Freefall29
<Chrysalis> and shit would hit the fan
<sonicdude558> oh no its a real live troll
<thelonepony> hi Freefall29 :)
<StinkomanFan> In this segment the Buddah is holding a bible
*sonicdude558 puts up a forcefield
<TheMaster> he says you don't need to be jewish. These arn't issues anymore
<Shizuka> 13pretty much where it begins and ends, fundamentalists that take the book literally
<StinkomanFan> ...Wait what?
<Colt_Brovakiin> Heya Freefall29
<OneTrickPony> hi Freefall29
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh shit, sonicdude558
<DeadpoolDash> wrek, hate doesn't have to be rational. In fact most of the time hate isn't rational.
<something> wrek ur dum
<CCCP> Is it possible that Jesus walked on water because it was ful of salt?
<Reikim> "First commandment: I am your only god, bitches. You will accept no other, for I am the real deal, and I am all that there is."
<RAWRity> Wrek: clearly he hates you because you kissed LadyCanary
<sonicdude558> This is sure to stop the troll!
<Kandarihu> Where are the Christians who are calling for that? I'm asking for examples here.
<Wrek> 05so i am mean and dumb. (thats how dumbius spelled btw)
<Shizuka> 13StinkomanFan: ah i was right, the idea that you bow to god and not build a statue or some idol you worship instead
<Bronysith> CCCP: it wasnt the dead sea
<Wrek> 05what else are yoru reasons?
<Lyra`> dumbius
<Chrysalis> oi old guy, we have proven that complex carbon chains can form through random events
<something> rape all the womans
<TheMaster> the point is they mean the biblical literalists think its 100% true, but its not
<LadyCanary> =_____________=
<Kandarihu> Fundies is too broad of a generalization here.
<StinkomanFan> So... when we bow to Celestia...?
<Reikim> Shizuka: Building a statue of God with which to worship Him is a-ok, though.
<Wrek> 05Lyra`: i went sudden latin
<Lyra`> something is just trying to troll/get kicked
<Canadian_Brony> Hello everypony.
<twilight_sprinkle> me thinks someone is using something 's account
<Lyra`> i know, it was awesome :D
<sonicdude558> hello Canadian_Brony
<TheMaster> but the founders were still not christians. At best they were diests. The foundation of america is based in John Locke and the enlightenment. Not religion
<CriticKitten> I read it when I was younger.
<thelonepony> Hi Canadian_Brony :)
<sonicdude558> There is a troll, ignore him
<Shizuka> 13Reikim: you sure? that i know of people make jesus statues and god paintings
<TheMaster> name one part of the constitution inspired by the bibl
<TheMaster> bible*
<twilight_sprinkle> something doesnt usually behave like that iirc
<Shizuka> 13but it's still god so okay by them? iunno
<Canadian_Brony> sonicdude558 oooh, where?
<Chrysalis> Shizuka why?
<something> i hate u all
<LadyCanary> Cool.
<Darf14> lol
<sonicdude558> someting is
<AVS619> lol
<Chrysalis> bible says though shall not worship idols
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, Deists believed that God just created the world and left it alone.
<Canadian_Brony> found him
<Wrek> 05well dear something. i have considered the reasons you have given me, and I have decided to live up to your expectations, and permanently ban you without any chance of appeal.
<Lyra`> the bible has a gun included?
<Darf14> Now thats a good use for a bible
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03stahp something. ur drnk. stahp
<Shizuka> 13yay wrek
<Lyra`> i need to buy the bible
<Reikim> Shizuka: The "no images of God" thing is pretty much uniquely Muslim, possibly Hebrew. Christians make sooooo much art of God. And they use it in their worship.
<TheMaster> they say A god. They never said it was Yahweh
<Chrysalis> didnt do no DRUUUUUGS
<Darf14> :D
<Ryunosuke> that disclaimer
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dat disclaimer
*sonicdude558 claps for Wrek
<DeadpoolDash> loz ban
<ASoftFluffyThing> dat ban
<TheMaster> diests don't believe in the judeo-christian god
<Shizuka> 13Reikim: that makes sense
<MadSurge> :D
<LadyCanary> That's our Wreky ^_^
<Canadian_Brony> Hi something! How are you this fine evening?
<CCCP> Why is it alright to make fun of Christianity but if its Liam people get really offended?
<CriticKitten> Buddha never did no druuuuuugs.
<sonicdude558> Everypony clap for Wrek!
<Reikim> ...
<Reikim> Why do I know these things
<OneTrickPony> lololol
<CCCP> Islam*
<Lyra`> stahp! Lyra`, hes drunk! pls, stahp!
<TheMaster> Yahweh isn't anymore likely to diests then the flying spaghetti monster
<Dark_Horst> *applauds*
<Cypresswolf> that was a good episode, I enjoyed the debate
<TheMaster> deists*
<Chrysalis> CCCP because liam was a cool guy
<CCCP> Fucking auto correct
<CriticKitten> CCCP: Who's making fun of Liam Neeson? D:<
<Shizuka> 13other than jesus i can't think of any statues of god ever, generally people can't agree on what god's supposed to look like other than michelangelo's sistine chapel
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03That's why I'm sticking with Raptor Jesus.
<Ryunosuke> that creeper teller
<Lyra`> aww, teller is embarased :3
<Darf14> best disguise ever
<TheMaster> Why do you think the semitic storm and hill god is any more likely to be the one true god than Thor or zues?
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03All hail his holy Raptor-ness
<CCCP> XD
<RAWRity> Shizuka: the general consensus seems to be "Old dude with big white beard"
<TheMaster> I like Thor more, he's got a hammer. Yahweh isn't close to as cool as Thor
<Canadian_Brony> unless Eating is a religion, I am non-religious
<Reikim> Statues less so, Shizu, but there are many many paintings. He also shows up in medieval art basically any time you see a light source.
<Ryunosuke> wat?
<AVS619> wat
<Chrysalis> you guys ever seen the church of google?
<TheMaster> Thor > YHWH
<ASoftFluffyThing> wat
<Darf14> Hes a mage
*sonicdude558 sneezes
<Lyra`> im okay with genie teller
<DeadpoolDash> behold the internet
<Canadian_Brony> hey, I just noticed something
<Bronysith> YAAAAAAY PORN
<AVS619> haha the internet
<StinkomanFan> Yay :)
<Ryunosuke> rule 34
<Canadian_Brony> Penn looks like Saturn
<sonicdude558> dat monitor
<Ryunosuke> that is all
<Cypresswolf> The Internet is for Porn!
<OneTrickPony> pr0n!
<Canadian_Brony> Have you noticed that?
<Kandarihu> The entire basis for Penn to claim that the Bible is a terrible source of morals was from the old testament. It's the old law that passed away.
<Lyra`> ahah
<ASoftFluffyThing> Oh god.
<TheMaster> try and match my l33t debate skills. Thor vs. YHWH. Thor has a hammer, and he's in movies. Thats why Thor is the superior god.
<DeadpoolDash> good old pron
<AVS619> hahah
<LadyCanary> Ooooh! Porn!
<Darf14> I wish for a pony
<Shizuka> 13she's right though
<sonicdude558> dem special effects
<Lyra`> i wish i was a pony!
<ASoftFluffyThing> This is going to be fun.
<Shizuka> 13really wish for a car with infinite gas
<Chrysalis> erm
<Shizuka> 13THEN get your porn
<DerpyMuffins> Porn really?
<Canadian_Brony> porn is bullshit?
<Chrysalis> why is one of his nails painted
<Lyra`> and everyone else was a pony
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate
<CCCP> What if god was Lauren Faust?
<Shizuka> 13god... men get your priorities in line
<ASoftFluffyThing> hi FillyFlam

<Chrysalis> Wrek and thors hammer is fucking badass
<MadSurge> Okay guys, bedtime for me. Goodnight! :)
<DeadpoolDash> I believe according to someone if you watch porn you are more likely to commit, which is clearly bullshit
<TheMaster> either you think theres a god or you don't

<Lyra`> uhh, whate were we talking about?
<RAWRity> Wrek: obviously they thought you were asatru or something.
<Metronome> If people ban porn, people will go out raping
<CCCP> But what about the WBC?
<Bronysith> You can never prove god exists. PERIOD, you have to accept him on faith alone
<killerpony7733> Porn is porn :D

<Darf14> *shivers* I logged off bronystate and only open this window ...*shivers* ...tell me when its over
<Lyra`> rrawr
<Lyra`> >.<
<DeadpoolDash> VHS and Blu-Ray owe their success to the porn industry
<Shizuka> 13Reikim: unlimited breadsticks, now there's a wish i can get behind
<RAWRity> Lyra`: you rang?
<Shizuka> 13especially if they're olive garden breadsticks
<Lyra`> uhh, umm.

<Dark_Horst> wow, they went all out on this one xD
<Ryunosuke> obligatory
<Freefall29> so, what exactly is this?
<TheMaster> porn isn't bad for women. How are the women in porn being mistreated? They consented and paid for it
<Lyra`> oof
<oGriofa> brbgotta mastur... do my homework
<Cypresswolf> Shizuka: don't tell him, I'm afraid of what he'll find to beat said challenger
<LadyCanary> Unlimited wubs, Shizuka :3

<Bronysith> Saturn: get ur sexy plot in here
<thelonepony> :D
<twilight_sprinkle> dayum shes full of wisdom
<killerpony7733> Wrek Many of us totally overreact?
<Dken2021|afk> alright, what happened Wrek?
<RAWRity> funfact: John Quincy Adams used to have sex outdoors wearing fur coats, and considered it a distinctly american freedom to do so.
<Mega_Milk> Wrek: <3
<Lyra`> Saturn
<Canadian_Brony> Chrysalis >got weird
<AVS619> bronystate just got more awesome diddnt think it was possible but it did
<Canadian_Brony> Chrysalis when was it never?
<Ryunosuke> boing!

<Chrysalis> it was always wierd
<Darf14> to be honest, I didnt see that coming at all
<Lyra`> teller XD
<Chrysalis> but its getting wierder
<CCCP> RAWRity I like this idea
<Canadian_Brony> Chrysalis always was, always will be.
<LadyCanary> Oh joyus Regan.
<CriticKitten> Butbutbut, Reagan was perfect, just ask Fox. D:
<DerpyMuffins> BState got weird fast
<twilight_sprinkle> porn actually seems to help people get rid of their..desires..which is what i think japan tries to do
<Dken2021> what the heck happened?
<Cypresswolf> After this episode, I'm going out for whiskey for this weekend :)
<Chrysalis> and Allegr0 comes in to the porn show

<Lyra`> umm.
<twilight_sprinkle> Allegr0: you chose an odd time to join bronystate :P
<thelonepony> lol
<LadyCanary> PRAISE TITTIES.
<Canadian_Brony> hi Allegr0! Get out while you still can!
<Allegr0> Chrysalis: I'm what o.0?
<TheMaster> grow up people who are uncomfortable. its just sex
<Lyra`> they do porn
<StinkomanFan> "JESUS WAS BLACK, REAGAN IS THE DEVIL, AND THE GOVERNMENT IS LYING ABOUT 9/11!"
<Chrysalis> Allegr0 watch the stream
<RAWRity> >North Carolina
<TheMaster> whats wrong with sex?
<CriticKitten> twilight_sprinkle: If so, it worked all too well. Japan's not meeting the necessary child-bearing quota to maintain its population.
<RAWRity> >oh lord
<DerpyMuffins> Get out Allegr0
<Dark_Horst> SPIRIT-TITS OF JUSTICE! word of the week
<Lyra`> you can tell by the guys clothing.
<DerpyMuffins> While you can
<TheMaster> sex is one of the most natural things people do
<DeadpoolDash> ...show hardcore...oh wait, this is HBO right?
<TheMaster> why is it bad?
<Ryunosuke> "I think I need an adult"
<Ryunosuke> OH MAI
<Wrek> 05they need better music though
<Shizuka> 13showtime
<Lyra`> told you!
*ASoftFluffyThing slaps StinkomanFan "You had that dream again, didn't you?"
<twilight_sprinkle> CriticKitten: iirc rape rates there are pretty low too
<Lyra`> NAILED IT!
<LadyCanary> O_O
<Alister> ewww
<Mega_Milk> oh mai~
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/HSFvM.png
<Allegr0> Chrysalis: I would if my universtiy wouldn't put my connection on a choke hold >.<
<Dken2021> Wrek c'mon, old 70s mood music it the thang
<Allegr0> but what is it?
<LadyCanary> lol Shizuka <3
<Lyra`> he has a great porn facial hair
<Spectrum_Rush> I think Wrek has won the raunchiest stream for now
<Chrysalis> Allegr0 brenn and teller on porn
<ASoftFluffyThing> Am I the only one that feels some heat around their neck?
<Canadian_Brony> Allegr0 Penn and Teller: Bullshit
<Lyra`> chewing her toy?
<Wrek> 05meh
<StinkomanFan> :o
<Wrek> 05never liked it
<sonicdude558> dat mac
<TheMaster> I've never heard a compelling argument against porn
*Bronysith dusts Allegr0
<CriticKitten> xD
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: :D hahaaha
<Lyra`> uhhh
<CriticKitten> Dat disclaimer
<Lyra`> uhhh.
<Bronysith> dem gloves
<Allegr0> hey Bronysith !
<Mega_Milk> Children avert your eyes
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk: lolol means I'm blushing
<Chrysalis> i will agree with her there
<Lyra`> mmmnn rawr
<Chrysalis> <3 satin
<Canadian_Brony> . . .
<RAWRity> y'know, i've always wondered what it's like for kids of porn stars. Like, imagine you hit 13, start looking at porn on your computer, then all of a sudden you see your parents doing the horizontal monster mash.
<TheMaster> is anyone actually uncomfortable? Its just sex
<Mega_Milk> While I go find my camcorder
<DeadpoolDash> sex at strip clubs isnt prostitution if it is recorded, then it is labled as porn
<Darf14> lol I am having a good time reading your reactions :)
<Dark_Horst> Allegr0: the show busies itself with reaonably bashing bullshit. this episode: "porn is evil!"
<Kandarihu> CriticKitten, there is a great deal of abortions going on in Japan, I hear. That's why the childbirth is so low.
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity, I imagine they would be scarred for life and never look at it again
<twilight_sprinkle> lul
<killerpony7733> TheMaster Nope i find this hilarious :D
<sonicdude558> uh Wrek
*StinkomanFan leans in unconfortably close to Lyra`
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: why?
<TheMaster> hahaha
<Kandarihu> Pregnancies are happening out of pure lust without love.
<Wrek> 05feels good to be considered hated for proper reasons now
<TheMaster> hah. fuckityfuckfuckfuck
<Dark_Horst> you heard that? you all heard what penn just said?
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03We here at bronystate does not approve minors viewing pornography, so if you're under 18, SHEILD YOUR INNOCENCE!
<Dark_Horst> tae it to heart
<Lyra`> yay
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: yeah a lot of people are like that nowadays..
*Mega_Milk doesnt hate Wrek
<Colt_Brovakiin> 6
<Colt_Brovakiin> 66
<thelonepony> ^^^
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, and that's a problem.
<sonicdude558> 666
<LadyCanary> Wubs Wrek anyway \:3/
<DerpyMuffins> I turned 18 last month....
<Colt_Brovakiin> ^
<Cypresswolf> I dont see a problem with it - we're all sexual beings after all - take away our intellegence, ability to reason, all the things that make us different from animals & what are we left with? thinking about nothing more than food & reproducing
<TheMaster> pictured: people who couldn't get into porn
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: agreed
<Spectrum_Rush> wut
<LadyCanary> .....Oh my god this woman is an IDIOT.
<Chrysalis> that woman needs her priorites
<Darf14> Im 12 and what is this .....JK I wanted to say that line
<TheMaster> how many people here are over 18 anyway?
<StinkomanFan> I'm 18 >_>
<Dark_Horst> ....you fucking serious lady?
<Bronysith> i enjoy porn
<Chrysalis> sociology AND womens studies?
<ASoftFluffyThing> TheMaster, me
<LadyCanary> And of WOMEN'S STUDIES. Seriously?
<Ryunosuke> wait
<Chrysalis> damn she has NO prospects
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: raising kids aint cool nowadays
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootalooo yeeeaaaaah, I can't legally and truthfully reply to that.
<CriticKitten> Yes it is
<DeadpoolDash> I love the people bullshit gets to be on TV
<Colt_Brovakiin> my keyboard derped, I was trying to agree with Mega_Milk :/
<Dken2021> Big news?
<Wrek> 05we do however aknowledge that americas view of nudity is outdated and children should be spared the cruelty of a boobless upbringing
<LadyCanary> ???
<DerpyMuffins> Im too lazy to watch any porn
<LadyCanary> War?
<Chrysalis> Wrek amen to that
<TheMaster> not all americans dislike nudity
<killerpony7733> What?
<Buytoast> ah yes, say tehy started it
<Mega_Milk> Wrek: FACT
<Ryunosuke> uhh
<CriticKitten> Let's not lie, lady, you're a feminist and you're against porn because omg there are boobs on camera. >_>
<TheMaster> I for one am a big fan of nudity
<LadyCanary> ...Yes. Yes it is.
<Spectrum_Rush> wut
<killerpony7733> Really you are stupid good woman
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, it's a dirty job but lots of people have to do it.
<Canadian_Brony> Dken2021 take a wild guess. What the f*ck are we waiting for?
<StinkomanFan> BABY TRAUMATISED UPON SEEING UNCONCEALED NIPPLES
*DeadpoolDash loves the titties
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03And I am aware that in some countries the legal age is lower, but still, unless you had some... GO AWAY!
*DeadpoolDash and guns
<LadyCanary> Oh yeah, he loves the cock.
<TheMaster> men should work! for womens bodies
<CriticKitten> See? Feminist.
<RAWRity> this woman realizes that there's plenty of guy-only porn too, right?
<DashWithRainbows> ...
<Reikim> Soooooo much ded.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: dirty at first, but i think its a good cause, you can raise a good person if done right
<Wrek> 05Shizuka: <3
<Chrysalis> Scoot-Scootalooo what about if youv had some but not legal?
<DashWithRainbows> wut de fack, Canary XD
<Reikim> I should dump some kind of massive rant here just to fill up space.
<Dark_Horst> i like how she doesnt notice that male porn actors are sexualized all the smae in the industry
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03Chrysalis: Then you're MLG legit
<Reikim> Justify this room's existence.
<DashWithRainbows> What a thing to see when you glance at chat.
<Reikim> And mine, at the same time.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Wrek, as an American I find it very stupid that the rest of the world is desensitized about nudity but the America isn't. Like, everyone was born naked. Don't know why they freak about a boob on TV >.>
<LadyCanary> ._.
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, sorry. I was just going by the saying.
<Chrysalis> awesome
<Allegr0> all the chatting :P
<CriticKitten> Holy shit. 84%?
<TheMaster> if anything. male porn actors are under-sexualized. if you really think about it.
<Darf14> In soviet Russia Porn Watches you
<LadyCanary> ....Huh.
<LadyCanary> How interesting.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: ah ok, dont apologize, i shouldve realized it :D
<StinkomanFan> :o
<TheMaster> male pleasure is very much underwhelming compared to female pleasure in porn
<Canadian_Brony> Darf14 uuuuuuh
*sonicdude558 stabs Darf14 with a knife
<Ryunosuke> that ebay
<Darf14> X_X
<TheMaster> how often do you see the mans face in a porno?
<FillyFlam> Ponies?
<StinkomanFan> THE MORE YOU KNOW
<Chrysalis> the internet is really really great
<Chrysalis> for porn
*Mega_Milk is a man who appreciates a good random boob form time to time
<OneTrickPony> porn
<Chrysalis> iv got a fast connection
<twilight_sprinkle> porn porn porn!
<Chrysalis> so i dont have to wait
<DeadpoolDash> lots of male porn stars have to go through gay porn to get to straight porn
<TheMaster> how often do you hear or see a man actually enjoy the sex compared to the women in porn?
<Lyra`> CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Mega_Milk /)
<twilight_sprinkle> i think they were making a reference to that porn song there
<Metronome> Tis a lie, Pony>Porn
<sonicdude558> orly Chrysalis how fast >=-)
<Chrysalis> for porn
<Dark_Horst> good point he has xD
<Lyra`> STOP PMing me trying to cyber!
<Mega_Milk> ASoftFluffyThing: (\
<Bronysith> Metronome: ponies make everything better...right?
<TheMaster> infact, just look at this tv show. Almost all of the show is focused on the women enjoying the sex
<Allegr0> will the real slim shady please stand up, Lyra` ?
<LadyCanary> Fuckin. \:3/
<Chrysalis> sonicdude558 not really that fast, it barely keeps up with the stream some times
<twilight_sprinkle> me thinks its the opposite actually
<Darf14> ...ok... never making that joke ever again
<TheMaster> society is incredibly misandrist
<Ryunosuke> that posh
<TheMaster> ...fuck you lady
*StinkomanFan covers the Twilight Sparkle dolls eyes

<LadyCanary> JESUS CHRIST.
<Yahooz> Allegr0: "we're gonna have a rpblem here"
<Mega_Milk> Lyra`: XD hahahaha
<Lyra`> DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I DONT WANNA CYBER WITH YOU!
<p4ngya> Lyra`: what's your opinion on all this?
<LadyCanary> ....
<CriticKitten> Feminist.
<CriticKitten> Of course.
<TheMaster> fuck that lady.
<LadyCanary> Her "theory"
<StinkomanFan> This woman has no breasts.
<DeadpoolDash> its HBO, they cant show penetration
<StinkomanFan> Nothing!
<Lyra`> p4ngya, my opinion is that people need to calm their hormones, im not in th mood.
<Kandarihu> I've heard charges that porn is nothing more than a way to promote prostitution. I'm not so sure of that, myself.
<TheMaster> she's just mad she didn't get to be in porn
<Dark_Horst> by her logic, every man on the planet is a fucking rapist
<CriticKitten> LOL
<Chrysalis> incoming diagram
<Mega_Milk> StinkomanFan: I think her vag fused with her gut....
<LadyCanary> Jesus christ could her pants BE any more high up?
<Darf14> oh HBO, that explains it
<Canadian_Brony> >complicated diagram
<p4ngya> Lyra`: lol i was talking about the stream :D
<Canadian_Brony> >*CENSORED*
<Yahooz> not sure if reverse psychology
<TheMaster> how about male objectification?
<Wrek> 05i am objecticied for my penis and my hsoulders.

<ASoftFluffyThing> LadyCanary, but then they'd get stuck at her armpits
<Colt_Brovakiin> Bye sonicdude558 :)
<LadyCanary> Wrek: Dem shoulders.
<Chrysalis> Hmmm, while this is on, i feel its a legit time to ask this
<Chrysalis> Ass or titties?
<StinkomanFan> ...what
<Bronysith> i enjoy porn pictures, i dont really care for the actual videos >.>
<Lyra`> i keep losing focus on what the stream has, because porn and the stream has porn, and the chat is not as good
<StinkomanFan> Titties, poo comes from ass
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: i say ass
<TheMaster> why is one of his fingers painted and none of the others?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Chrysalis, both
<Darf14> well cya guys, even though it was short
<Laurayne> SUDDENLY! http://www.lolbrary.com/post/12640/a-wild-johnny-depp-appears/
<Chrysalis> i expected more hate for that
<DeadpoolDash> ass and titties, why choose?
<CriticKitten> HAHAHA
<ASoftFluffyThing> Ohai teller

<TheMaster> IT BURNS
<LadyCanary> XDDD
<TheMaster> IT BURNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNS

<ASoftFluffyThing> What's the freakout for?
<SadisticPony> lol
<RAWRity> she's got a pretty fine ass for a woman her age

<LadyCanary> Involves vegatables.
<ASoftFluffyThing> Well.....
<Lyra`> its rape if you say "DONT FUCKING TOUCH ME"
<Lyra`> because if no meant no, everyone would be a virgin
<CriticKitten> ....
<LadyCanary> Oh yes. Stammering DEFINITELY alludes confidence.
<LadyCanary> Nice work lady.
<TheMaster> some people can actually talk another human being into having sex with them
<DeadpoolDash> if consent isnt given or cant be given its rape
<Chrysalis> wasnt there a study on this
<TheMaster> I have!
<CriticKitten> LadyCanary: But she's got a doctorate degree! D:
<TheMaster> 2 studies
<Chrysalis> but they couldnt find a large enough sample size that hadnt watched porn
<Kandarihu> p4ngya, the rapists claim that rape is nothing more than "surprise sex" and it's what the victim "didn't know she wanted"
<CriticKitten> And this is why all degrees are not created equal.
<LadyCanary> CriticKitten: From Uptight Uninformed Bitch University.
<Dark_Horst> Kandarihu: no, that'S a 4chan meme
<Mega_Milk> LadyCanary: So that's nice going "Doctor Lady"
<StinkomanFan> :|
<Bronysith> I love Princess Molestia tumblr, funny and great drawings
<BaconMane> 0,5lolwut
<Kandarihu> Dark_Horst, ...you're right.
<Lyra`> no good science XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Bronysith, I second that
<Lyra`> and she has a cute O face
<DashWithRainbows> Elsie
<Cypresswolf> that was an actual experiment? O_o

<Canadian_Brony> ohai BaconMane
<DeadpoolDash> hmmm....time to watch real pron
<DerpyMuffins> Im reminded of Molestia all of a sudden
<DashWithRainbows> You're too young for this, BaconMane.
<CriticKitten> With a bulldog as their mascot?
<DashWithRainbows> Go to bed.
<AVS619> lol happy people
<StinkomanFan> Oooh!
<Chrysalis> i think hes happy
<Dken2021> it's official, I hate Emolgas!
<CriticKitten> Kinda sorta.
<TheMaster> its not degrading
<TheMaster> how is it degrading?
<LadyCanary> ....
<LadyCanary> Okay.
<LadyCanary> You gotta be kidding me.
<CriticKitten> ....
<Mega_Milk> -lol
<killerpony7733> No facehoofing can describe the stupid
<StinkomanFan> So, Chrysalis. Does lust taste like love or what?
<BaconMane> 0,5O fooohck
<CriticKitten> LOL
<Chrysalis> StinkomanFan not really
<TheMaster> women are being paid to be in porn. whats degrading about it?
<LadyCanary> ...
<DeadpoolDash> DP Inc
<Dark_Horst> great. she has lemmings
<BaconMane> 0,5...wat
<CriticKitten> "To explain why porn is bad, I'm going to show you some now."
<BaconMane> 0,5HAHAHAH
<DerpyMuffins> Oh yea
<Lyra`> shes doing what?
<Lyra`> :O
<StinkomanFan> ...ME GUSTA
<Lyra`> HOW HORRIFYING
<Spectrum_Rush> pfft
<DashWithRainbows> dem pixels
<DeadpoolDash> oh showtime, not HBO
<Mega_Milk> Lust: Its like flying a kite, Through a buuurning poppy field"
<Chrysalis> om nom nom
<twilight_sprinkle> ohhhh so thats what DP stands for..now i get it..>.>
<ASoftFluffyThing> All the pixels
<TheMaster> man, she made porn boring
<Canadian_Brony> God damn it, I can't say anything about this!
<taoumi> boobies
<CriticKitten> Those kids look riveted
<taoumi> wat
<CriticKitten> ....
<CriticKitten> wait wat
<Chrysalis> Well
<Silver_Spoon> wat
<DerpyMuffins> Did she just make porn boring?
<Kandarihu> Cypresswolf, about us being reduced to animals. At least mammals care for their young after they're born.
<StinkomanFan> NO
<LadyCanary> ....
<RAWRity> TerribleFact: in Conneticut, there is now legal precedent that women are in "a constant state of consent" unless otherwise stated, and thus it legally isn't rape unless the woman says no.
<Spectrum_Rush> come back when its DVDA
<Chrysalis> that escalated quickly
<Lyra`> they arent even listening to her
<StinkomanFan> NO
<LadyCanary> Oh my god.

<CriticKitten> ....
<Dark_Horst> soooo?
<LadyCanary> Certain times yes, I find it degrading.
*Mega_Milk is a man who enjoys his porn
<Cypresswolf> Kandarihu: cant argue with that. its a dispicable pratice
<TheMaster> ...its not because they look like children. who would even...what?
<DeadpoolDash> men shave their pubic hair too
<Dark_Horst> ...yeah, right
<Chrysalis> woman you have no idea what your talking about
<Lyra`> is it stagatory if youre both under aged?
<TheMaster> the only one with twisted logic is that woman
<Bronysith> Chrysalis: *you're
<StinkomanFan> The audience look either confused or too distracted by the picture
<LadyCanary> But that's not the point. It's for pleasure purposes.
<CriticKitten> Lady.
<Ryunosuke> BUFFER
<CriticKitten> What are you doing.
<TheMaster> maybe people don't like hair in the first place?
<CriticKitten> Lady, stahp.
<Silver_Spoon> screen cap opportunity?
<Sain> CriticKitten: ikr
<Chrysalis> Bronysith you are aware i barely passed english right?
<Dark_Horst> captain buffer again. not so day-saving this time
<TheMaster> gender study classes are bullshit themselves

<Bronysith> Chrysalis: sorry, meanwhile has conditioned me beyond belief
<Lyra`> pls, LadyCanary stahp
<ASoftFluffyThing> Nice, scout19_tf2
<Canadian_Brony> WB scout19_tf2
<DocSane> I really despise non-scientists who made sweeping generalizations without any sort of data to back it up.
<RAWRity> personally I like it when they shave lightning bolts or racing stripes into their pubic hair
<TheMaster> just like the debate last night. They use awful, awful logic and awful, awful non-facts
<Chrysalis> hell, i actually DID fail one of my english gcse's
<Mega_Milk> scout19_tf2: Looking sharp there tex :3
<Lyra`> i like to shave mine into a heart :3
<Silver_Spoon> I keep shouting show me the study. I just wanna see a study :x
<ASoftFluffyThing> Uh.....
<fluttercry> 05,15We're done with that, change the subject now
<CriticKitten> Didn't mean you, LadyCanary, I meant the twatburger saying she has no studies to prove the bullshit she's spewing. :P
<TheMaster> that "women make 75% of men" 'fact' came up yesterday at the debate. and one of my students used it too. its such bullshit.
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03We here at Bronystate would like to apologize if you're minds were corrupted in some way...
<BaconMane> 0,5And that ends Bronystate After Hours. Come back tomorrow for *content visible to Bronystate GOLD members only*

<Dark_Horst> "we are doing maintenance, will be back soon" AGAIN?
<TheMaster> ...we're all adults here and can handle boobies I think
<Mega_Milk> Nittany_Discord: Hot. Thats all ill say.
<twilight_sprinkle> oh limeV, i guess that means yes
<Dark_Horst> something ahtes me
<Canadian_Brony> ohai fluttercry
<CriticKitten> Just making sure. ^_^
<DocSane> This woman is basically earning a living making up wild claims and then not doing anything to prove or disprove them.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01We're not showing that again.
<TheMaster> who here can't handle boobs?
<Canadian_Brony> good
<DeadpoolDash> the censors have returned
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03SO ANYWAYS.... How 'bout dat Derek Jeter?
<LadyCanary> ;__;
<StinkomanFan> How about we watch the episode on Ghosts Nittany_Discord?
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootalooo who?
<scout19_tf2> TheMaster: da fuq
<LadyCanary> He's gonna be out for 4-5 months, Scoot-Scootalooo
<fluttercry> 05,15That was terribly inappropriate. And we're sorry about that. Anyway, how bout dat baseball
<twilight_sprinkle> funny, that was actually less flammable than religion though
<Dken2021> in other news, Emolgas are the devil!
<TheMaster> What was innapropriate about it?
<Mega_Milk> fluttercry: -lol
<Dark_Horst> did he just change the embed?
<twilight_sprinkle> but yeah, i guess its for the best
<DeadpoolDash> baseball sucks
<Silver_Spoon> fluttercry: Go Red Socks?
<StinkomanFan> Pitching or recieving Fluttercry? ;)
<Lyra`> what did i miss?
<Bronysith> so wait, Wrek in big trouble?
<killerpony7733> TheMaster Good question. Guess we'll never know
<Cypresswolf> I dont care for baseball - my hometeam is the Astros :|
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry pfft, baseball. Play lacrosse, the REAL Canadian sport!
<Chrysalis> quick
<TheMaster> B-but...what?
<Chrysalis> post ponies
<Chrysalis> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/14/_6hgOARoN0OtXuqzFONaiQ2.png
<ASoftFluffyThing> That was interesting.
<DocSane> Did the mods suddenly remember that middle schoolers hang out in this channel?
<TheMaster> Middle schoolers shouldn't watch it then
<Ryunosuke> guess we know which side of THAT arguement the mods were on :p
<TheMaster> this is the internet, the big boys room.
*Mega_Milk is for whatever side is for the boobs....
<Lyra`> so what are we doing now?
<TheMaster> We're not responsible for what they see. You can literally look at nudity on google in 5 seconds.
<Canadian_Brony> TheMaster good thing I'm in high school :)
<Cypresswolf> http://arch.413chan.net/sparta_pony-%28n1294304865058%29.png
<Canadian_Brony> wait . . .
<Chrysalis> https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/13/tTBsCdLNOUqcb9JV7UFxjQ2.jpg
<Lyra`> Nittany_Discord, i find what you said offensive
<TheMaster> you're canadian, your age of consent law is like 16. you're fine
<Canadian_Brony> that doesn't mean a damn thing, does it?
<StinkomanFan> Imbed switched!
<TheMaster> and its not like you're permanently scared for seeing tits
<Bronysith> hey Shizuka is wrek in deep trouble?
<Lyra`> about that thing, the one time
<Cypresswolf> :3 http://bulk.destructoid.com/ul/user/2/25438-214118-PONIESjpg-620x.jpg
<LadyCanary> O_O
<Ryunosuke> anyone who cannot find porn on the internet, fails at life :)
<DeadpoolDash> age of consent varies from state to state
<Chrysalis> inb4 wrek has been banned off the streaming site
<ASoftFluffyThing> And country to country
<TheMaster> Wrek should not be in trouble. Theres nothing wrong with boobs. Bullshit never even went below the waist
<Dark_Horst> i would be really grateful if you could switch the embed back to mips again. limeV is down for me here. again
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lyra`: Sorry, but we have standards.
<TheMaster> every single person in this stream -has- boobs
<TheMaster> what is offensive about it?
<DerpyMuffins> So...Wrek banned?
<doctor_whooves127> you can find porn without even looking for it
<scout19_tf2> TheMaster: da fuq
<fluttercry> 05,15TheMaster let it go. it wasn't appropriate to be shown, therefore it was cut.
<StinkomanFan> But I like Wrek :'(
<TheMaster> fine. whatev
<Lyra`> i dont even know what we're talking about anymore, Nittany_Discord XD

<LadyCanary> SHE'S GORGEOUS RAWRity
*CriticKitten hugs Sain
<ASoftFluffyThing> RAWRity, that Rarity. NYCC?
<Silver_Spoon> youtube apparently has a censored version of that episode :x
<CriticKitten> Wow, that cosplay is really pretty. Sheesh. ._.

<Kandarihu> I dragged my XChat over the stream all episode long. Kind of what I do for my pony fast, only I covered the WHOLE stream this time.
<Allegr0> so, while we wait for someone else to take the helm, I present to you the third romney/obama debate!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX_1B0w7Hzc
<TheMaster> Why is it okay to show R rated movies like fight club but not a episode of Bullshit?
<Dark_Horst> is someone streaming right now? cant tell, limeV is pulling that maintenace crap on me again
<fluttercry> 05,15TheMaster I said cut it out

<CriticKitten> Allegr0: Oh god. This gun be good
<Bronysith> Allegr0: sorry, but i really dont like seeing middle schoolers argue
<ASoftFluffyThing> That Rarity looks like one of my friends
<StinkomanFan> NOPONY likes politics
<doctor_whooves127> you know this is why i like japan
<Allegr0> Bronysith: I promise you'll like this link ;)

<Wrek> 05yeah and its annoying me
<DerpyMuffins> Oh good, Wrek isnt banned
<Wrek> 05anyways lets see
<Ryunosuke> wrek when was the last time you defragged?
<J_E_Smith71> Looking away from the chat and the stream for a while. What the heck happened? Was that ep of Bullshit too hot for Bronystate?
<Wrek> 05too logn ago
<Ryunosuke> might be a part of the problem ;)
<Dken2021> J_E_Smith71 apparently we aren't that mature enough, sad really
<Canadian_Brony> ASoftFluffyThing agh, no thank you. I gave up on Epic Rap Battles after S1 ended. Don't ask me why, I honestly don't find it funny any more.
<Wrek> 05J_E_Smith71: yes it was, but i still crashed
<CriticKitten> ....that was glorious. Especially the ending
<LadyCanary> The episode was so hot, it made your computer crash.
<DeadpoolDash> balls so hot
*Chrysalis grabs meanwhiles cinderblock and hits DeadpoolDash with it
<J_E_Smith71> So is Bullshit banned, or just that one episode whatever it was?
<Scoot-Scootalooo> 00,03So anyways, this exists http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHOVRhN5yTA&list=PLC3CAD22F3C1E41EC&index=102&feature=plpp_video
<Dark_Horst> Allegr0: the eagle won. definately
<DeadpoolDash> tis a fleshwound
<Kandarihu> I wouldn't consider that hot, just too sexual.
<ASoftFluffyThing> J_E_Smith71, I'm guessing just that episode but I'm not gonna go into it
<Canadian_Brony> J_E_Smith71 that one ep probably.
<Allegr0> Dark_Horst: eagle!
<CriticKitten> Eagle was definitely best pony in that video.
<Canadian_Brony> gtg, see y'all later!

<ASoftFluffyThing> J_E_Smith71, Wreck It Ralph?
<Bronysith> Allegr0: middle schoolers bashing on eachother, they only let retards be president
<Bronysith> its like requirements

<Wrek> 05where a man got jailed for not keeping his lawn in "proper" with the rest of the community the house was in
<J_E_Smith71> I don't know if anyone cares about the Country Bear Jamboree, but they cut five minutes from the show and axed two songs, and cut one song I liked in half
<fluttercry> 05,15gotta love home owner's associations
<Allegr0> Bronysith: then just do a write-in for your favorite neighborhood Duke of Bronystate :)
<Allegr0> I promise I'd be a benevolent tyrant!
<Chrysalis> god damnit youtube

<Lyra`> IKR1
<Kandarihu> Bronysith, we're choosing between a guy (hardly the first) who royally screwed over our economy and someone with the knowhow to get it working again.

<fluttercry> 05,15Makes the neighborhood uniform
<SpadeMagnes[R]> Its my house I can make it how I choose
<taoumi> is there any streem going? or does this school block things?
<Lyra`> also, Wrek hasnt said sorry, given me a hug, or told LadyCanary shes beautiful yet.
<doctor_whooves127> ??
<Lyra`> just wanted to point that out.
<LadyCanary> >___<

<Lyra`> Supervisor: Why?
<Lyra`> Me: There’s a cat gang bang happening on top of my car.

<Lyra`> Supervisor: Well can’t you break it up?
<Lyra`> Me: Who am I to break up a cat gang bang? They’ve probably been organizing it for days on Craigslist.
