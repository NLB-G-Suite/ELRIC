<Ken> jordan@*.dslgb.com is what is banned
<Presea> ya
<Presea> he's not comming back
<Dawnfire> flimsy ban.
<Presea> he's a dumbass
<Dawnfire> You might try something like *@*
<Presea> no
<Dawnfire> then the isp
<Presea> he's a dumbass
<Dawnfire> is he?
<Presea> he wouldn't know how to change his ident
<Dawnfire> Java nub then?
<Presea> no
<Presea> just a dumbass
<Presea> 8D
<Ken> Umm I'm confused, I haven't done it in a while, how do you add a gline?
<Dawnfire> If you say so
<Presea> anyways i kinda want him to evade
<Dawnfire> /gline +0 <hostname wildmask>
<Presea> so i can abuse the fuck out of his client
<Ken> k
<Dawnfire> that's a perma I think
<Dawnfire> XD
<Ken> Dawnfire: The longer the better
<Dawnfire> muwhahahahaha
<Iago> What?
<Dawnfire> the + is the time.
<Iago> Isn't it /gline hostname time reason?
<Dawnfire> hmm
*Ken sighs and googles
<Dawnfire> You're right Iago
<Dawnfire> XD
<Iago> XD
<Dawnfire> ***** Gline *****
<Dawnfire> [07:50:22] -

<Dawnfire> [07:50:22] connect to ANY server on the IRC network

<Iago> I forgot what I put for his ban reason
<Dawnfire> been a while since I oper'd
<Dawnfire> pff who needs a reason.
<Dawnfire> XD
<Iago> oh
<Iago> "Go the fuck away"
<Dawnfire> HAHAHA
<Iago> said guy is a fuckface though
<Iago> so that's appropriate
<Ken> so /gline jordan@*.dslgb.com 0 You are not wanted on any network ?
<Dawnfire> Indeed
<Dawnfire> Works
<Iago> yeah Ken
<Ken> k
<Dawnfire> don't forget the +0
<Iago> or you can gline *@*.dslgb.com
<Iago> no need for =
<Iago> er +*
<Dawnfire> The line Iago said would be good
<Iago> tis' just 0
<Iago> up to you
<Ken> So host reason?
<Iago> probably akill would be better
<Dawnfire> yeh
<Iago> if you have anope
<Dawnfire> I think they do
<Ken> I might akill, we were playing with it earlier
<Iago> -> /os akill add 0 *@*.dslgb You are not welcome here.
<Iago> or something
<Dawnfire> Yup Anope 1.8.7
<Dawnfire> WIN
<Iago> I'm running 1.8.7 or somewhat
<Ken> Dawnfire: You don't know what net I'm talking about
<Dawnfire> Maybe I do
<Dawnfire> maybe I don't
<Dawnfire> I assume this one
<Dawnfire> Dun discount me because I switch reason and time fields. 'tis that way on older versions of unreal, pre 3.x
<Dawnfire> and a few other ircds
<Iago> Ken's not talking about this one
<Iago> and fuck, forgot that akill added the oper's nick
<Iago> I hate that
<Dawnfire> Eh
<Dawnfire> Doesn't matter.
<Dawnfire> Not like he can bitch much
<Iago> well one moment
<Dawnfire> he's banned TROLOL
<Dawnfire> nicve
<J0rd4n> what the fuck was my pass
<Dawnfire> LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
<Dawnfire> atcha
<Dawnfire> shesh
<Dawnfire> I use an alias
<Dawnfire> and /ns group
<Dawnfire> you'd have to group the nick anyway to use OS
<Dawnfire> it won't answer to unreg'd nicks
<Ken> Iago I don't give a fuck if my nick is there, he can kiss my fanny
<Ken> ;p
<Dawnfire> and OS would use your Display nick
<Iago> -OperServ- 1 *@*.dslgb.com [J0rd4n] Go the fuck away.
<Dawnfire> /ns set display <nick> would be required
<Iago> >:D
<Dawnfire> Win
<Iago> workarounds, go!
<Iago> Ken, I don't either
<Dawnfire> yah
<Iago> but having my nick there is just dodgy
<Iago> probably will mod anope one day
<Iago> just not now
<Ken> J0rd4n you did this yourself, don't believe me *paste*
<Dawnfire> But nobody wants to be biched at while on anothr net
<Iago> yah
<Dawnfire> LOOOOOOOOOOL
<Iago> lmfao
<Dawnfire> ogod
<Dawnfire> I 13♥ your style
<Iago> XD
<Ken> "How the fuck did I add my self to the akill list? o.O"
<Iago> lmfao
<Dawnfire> "Douchery"
<Ken> "Must be part of services, haven't figured it fully out"
<Dawnfire> "Anope hates it"
<Iago> well I have gb and obsidian added to spamfilter for warning
<Dawnfire> LOL
<Iago> I'll set Nightshadow|VNC to print messages into whatever chan when i get home
<Iago> for ease of use
<Ken> Iago: Even if opers say it does it echo?
<Iago> who the fuck wants to look through a fuckton of longs
<Iago> huh, Ken?
<Iago> say what?
<Ken> Ie the spamfilter
<Dawnfire> uhm
<Iago> nope
<Iago> only uses
<Dawnfire> btw
<Iago> users
<Ken> k
<Iago> also, !pants
<Dawnfire> /raw help snomasks
<Iago> yeah I know Dawnfire
<Dawnfire> you could learn some snomasks and set those
<Dawnfire> xD
<Iago> I have all the snomasks mainly for tracking purposes
*Ken can't have snomasks ._.
<Iago> Ken, type !pants
<Iago> or Dawnfire
<Iago> >:D
<Iago> XD
<Dawnfire> trolol
<Dawnfire> evulz Iago
<Dawnfire> You did that for the evulz
<Dawnfire> XD
<Iago> XD
<Iago> wb
<Iago> *** Ken [Iota@hooh-F8FEFE6C.elitebnc.net] has quit [brb putting on pants]
<Iago> >:D
<Iago> bwhahahahaha
<Dawnfire> you -could- set up BNC accounts and give each a snomask and load the watch module.
<Iota-> ass
<Iota-> >.>
<Dawnfire> and have each one print to diff oper only channels
<Dawnfire> XD
<Iago> Dawnfire, fuxing lazy
<Iago> I'm on a BNC anyway
<Dawnfire> I know
<Dawnfire> but not hard.
<Iago> yeah
<Iago> well, I'd rather write a script
<Iago> tis' far easier
<Dawnfire> That works too
<Iago> and better
<Iago> though can't say Nightshadow|VNC is the most stable thing ever
<Iago> might just stick it on ESG
<Iago> anyway
<Dawnfire> I actually have a server notice monitor script myself
<Iago> Ah
<Iago> I'm on xchat
*Dawnfire forgets where the code is tho
<Dawnfire> oh
<Iago> well atm I'm on CGI:IRC
<Dawnfire> yah mIRC much better.
<Iago> mIRC's better for scripting
<Dawnfire> almost essential for opers
<Iago> xchat's better for actual use though
<Dawnfire> who want to script anything
<Iago> well, xchat is better
<Dawnfire> Vanilla vs Vanilla
<Dawnfire> yes
<Ken> I actually have an oper panel
<Iago> mIRC will crash under most stress tests
<Dawnfire> Xchat wins
<Iago> oper panels suck cocks
<Ken> Shut it, it works
<Iago> lrn2oper
<Iago> commands <3
<Iago> and alias
<Iago> alises
<Dawnfire> but mIRC can do pretty well under stress
<Iago> aliases
<Iago> depends
<Iago> Presea completely fucked all the mIRC oper clients on here yesterday
<Presea> hehehehehe
<Dawnfire> howso?
<Ken> Iago: KeiichiNetRadio on Rizon
<Dawnfire> spammage?
<Iago> with the amount of snomasks and notices that were printing
<Dawnfire> trolol
<Iago> sajoin spam
<Dawnfire> This is why
<Presea> a ban evader was asking for it
<Iago> timer 0 0 and everything
<Dawnfire> you build scripts to detect that
<Dawnfire> and set snomasks off
<Iago> and + there was services log chan going on as well
<Presea> he kept joining under new nicks and ips
<Iago> so
<Dawnfire> if the snotices get crazay
<Iago> it derped the clients
<Dawnfire> and flooddetach would mitigate that via ZNC
<Iago> my xchat was fine though
<Iago> eh
<Iago> they're not on ZNC
<Dawnfire> or script to detect and autopart
<Iago> and it was snotices
<Iago> I'm too lazy to do that
<Dawnfire> lol
<Dawnfire> pff
<Iago> and that's the first time it's happened anyway
<Dawnfire> it's maybe 10 lines of code
<Iago> so
<Iago> true
<Dawnfire> and it never hurts to be prepared
<Iago> probably
<Iago> I'll make do when I get home
<Dawnfire> If one makes scripts to avoid mIRC's weaker usecases
<Dawnfire> it's rock solid
<Dawnfire> and it's only heel is flud
<Dawnfire> so
<Dawnfire> flood mitigation scripts go a long way
<Iago> well
<Iago> I kinda want to see things sometimes honestly
<Dawnfire> True
<Iago> xchat's better for opers
<Dawnfire> This is why I suggested bouncing oper'd mIRC operbots
<Iago> on larger networks
<Iago> heh
<Iago> well as long as things work it's fine
<Dawnfire> ZNC's flood detach module alone works wonders and it updates the client on re-attach with a piece of the action
<Dawnfire> if you config it right
<Iago> though with Presea's sajoin spam we had about I dnno
<Dawnfire> lol
<Dawnfire> yeah
<Presea> heh i lagged the bnc
<Presea> if i recall
<Iago> 50 lines a second?
<Iago> I dunno
<Dawnfire> you accept that danger with Presea
<Iago> lmfao yeah
<Dawnfire> He's pretty awesome but scary
<Iago> XD
<Dawnfire> I can flood shit too but lol I'm not oper'd so I flood myself out usually
<Dawnfire> XD
<Ken> Then you had Moot_AI last night and the night before... da fuck
<Presea> lol
<Dawnfire> oh fuck
<Dawnfire> dayum
<Iago> and derpbot
<Iago> !sym on

<derpbot> True_ai: That was my original intention.
<Dawnfire> he might set False_AI off
<derpbot> in the ass
<True_ai> derpbot: I thought it was too.
<derpbot> True_ai: I thought it was too.
<True_ai> derpbot: Is it still too anymore?
<derpbot> True_ai: Is it still too anymore?
<True_ai> derpbot: What is your favorite color?
<derpbot> True_ai: What is your favorite color?

<derpbot> True_ai: My favorite color is transparent.
<Iago> oh god no
<True_ai> derpbot: transparent is a pretty color.

<Hooh68202> 07XD
<Presea> orly
<Hooh68202> 07Yeah.
<Presea> what about forum names
<Hooh68202> 07Never did anything with the forum. Just joined this to talk with Armageddon easily a year ago. Perhaps two.
<Presea> Iago is armageddon
<Hooh68202> 07Ah, I see.
<Hooh68202> 07Can't expect everyone to keep the same name for so long :P
<Hooh68202> 07Ah, yes, now I remember.
<Zappy> 07Fuck, can't remember the password though.
<Presea> one sec
<Presea> >_>
<Zappy> Yeah, definitely forgot the password.
<Presea> i force id'ed you
<Zappy> Ah, I see.
<Zappy> 07So, how are you?
<Presea> i'm alright
<Presea> just working on true_ai
<Zappy> 07I assume that's a very (or at least relatively) complex bot?
<Presea> ya
<Dawnfire> extremely complex
<Zappy> 07What does it do?
<Presea> been working on it since 2006
<Zappy> 07Ah, shit son.
<Zappy> 07That's a long time.
<Drake> 04What's NS' bot again? The really annoying one?
<Drake> 04derpbit that's it
<Drake> 04bot*
<Presea> derpbot
<Zappy> 07So uh... Anyone here read homestuck?
<Presea> oddly i've randomly read it
<Zappy> 07All of it? It took me like, six days of morning to night reading to get through it. And there's been a lot of updates since then XD
<Presea> na not all of it
<Presea> i just randomly read it
<Zappy> 07Ah.
<Presea> i blame raichukitten for linking me to it though
<Zappy> 07Pfft
<Zappy> 07Did you get to the fucked up troll romance part? Holy shit that was confusing DX
<Presea> lol it's been awhile though
<Presea> seen like 400 anime series or so since i last read any of that web comic
<Presea> been keeping up with grim tales and ppgd and randomly looking for group
<Presea> although i should catch up on this i guess
<Drake> 04Homestuck is too large for me
<Zappy> 07It's like, thousands of pages long.
<Presea> won't stop me
<Zappy> 07Either 3000 or 6000, I can't remember.
<Drake> 04hey Presea
<Drake> 04I assume you've seen PMMM?
<Presea> madoka?
<Drake> 04yeah
<Presea> yes
<Presea> 3 times
<Drake> 04XD
<Presea> muhahahahaha

*Drake hugs back
<Iago> penis
<Iago> :3
<Drake> 04I do indeed have one.
<Drake> 04The scary thing is one of my friends has a whole archive of penises from pictures guys who wanted to get in her pants sent her.
<Drake> 04It's creepy, and I felt like vomiting when I accidentally saw several ;_;
<CrazyPresea> orly
<Drake> 04yarly
<CrazyPresea> heh you don't have the mind of a doctor
<CrazyPresea> a body part is a body part
<Drake> 04No I do not
<CrazyPresea> then again i might be like that because i'm asexual
<Drake> 04probably
<Drake> 04Lack of sexual attraction probably contributes to a lack of a sense of privacy with body parts usually associated with sex and sexual attraction
<CrazyPresea> no idea why im' like this btw
<CrazyPresea> ya
<Drake> 04Hey, if you're not turned on by /either/ boobs or dicks, that ain't my problem.
<CrazyPresea> i might be attracted to non-gender humans
*CrazyPresea hide
<Iago> [19:55:57] <Drake> The scary thing is one of my friends has a whole archive of penises from pictures guys who wanted to get in her pants sent her.
<Iago> what
<Drake> 04That was my reaction
<CrazyPresea> why would she archive them
<CrazyPresea> anyways
<CrazyPresea> free porn i guess
<CrazyPresea> other then that i see no point
<CrazyPresea> OH WAIT
<CrazyPresea> black mail
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04I'll admit, I can see why a lot of guys want her
<Drake> 04She's pretty attractive
<CrazyPresea> heh
<CrazyPresea> alot pigs then
<CrazyPresea> sending her those photos
<CrazyPresea> anyways it's better to like someone for who they are
<CrazyPresea> ppl are so stupid at times :<
<Drake> 04I agree completely
<Drake> 04To both points
<Iago> anyway bbl piano
<CrazyPresea> o/
<CrazyPresea> hmm
<Lilith> hi
<CrazyPresea> hi
<Lilith> How are you?
<CrazyPresea> i'm alright
<Lilith> cool
<Lilith> ugh, same old boring day.
<prince-dari> Hey Kimori
<Kimori> yo
<Kimori> how are ya?
<prince-dari> Fine thanks, you?
<Kimori> doing good
<prince-dari> Are you seeing people post this Kony video everywhere too?
<Kimori> uh no?
<Kimori> what is it?
<prince-dari> 'Make Kony famous' is basically the idea, so everyone knows about this guy and his crimes, 30 years of forcing kidnapping and killing children, forcing them to be soldiers, kill their own parents and other people
<Kimori> are they doing that because he was recently captured?
<prince-dari> Nah, he hasn't been captured.
<prince-dari> They're trying to make it happen
<prince-dari> Considering how everyone knows about Gadaffi, Mugabi, and loads of other dictators I'm surprised by how few people (including myself) have heard of this guy.
<Kimori> yeah
<Kimori> so...what have you been up to lately?
<Kimori> no plans yet on registering the channel? heh
<prince-dari> Hah, no, despite Kjakings bugging me. If he wants it registered, he can register it. :P
<Kimori> I thought you were the only one who could do it since your at the top
<Kimori> or have ops if thats what its called
<prince-dari> That's just because I'm always connected to the channel, if everyone leaves, the channel doesn't exist any more, so the first person to join gets op
<Kimori> Ive been wondering when it will come to a point that nobody else knows this channel is around
<Kimori> is it posted anywhere?
<prince-dari> Well, on SF
<prince-dari> And a few other places
<Kimori> spyroforums?
<prince-dari> Yeah
<prince-dari> "Join us on SpyroChat, the largest live Spyro chatroom!"
<prince-dari> >two people
<prince-dari> Lul
<Kimori> ...
<Kimori> Is there another spyro chat room?
<prince-dari> I dunno
<prince-dari> Maybe not
<prince-dari> If DS has one, it's probably active
<prince-dari> Unlike here
<prince-dari> :P
<Kimori> if there is one
<Kimori> I probably would want to join it
<Kimori> I really dont see this place turning around
<prince-dari> Yeah, not likely.
<prince-dari> Especially with SR AWOL most of the time, and not appointing any site admins.
<Kimori> do you go to any other irc channels?
<prince-dari> Pretty much just the main channel of this network, though there isn't that much chat there.
<prince-dari> This network's pretty dead as of a while ago.
<Kimori> ive been going to a yoshi fan channel for the past 6 years
<Kimori> not sure if your a big nintendo fan though
<prince-dari> I'm not a huge Nintendo fanboy
<prince-dari> I like them, but that's about as far as it goes
<Kimori> hm..
<Kimori> I guess I can check to see if theres an irc channel for DS
<Kimori> but its probably unlikely
<Kimori> it doesnt look like theres anything irc related on the other site
<Kimori> lol
<Kimori> it just links to here
<Kimori> when I searched for an irc channel
<Kimori> there are some discussions about this channel on the forums
<Kimori> they really need to change that description
<Kimori> smallest chatroom lol
<Kimori> you still there dari
<prince-dari> Went AFK for a bit
<Kimori> am about go to eat some breakfast
<prince-dari> Ok
<Kimori> back
<Kimori> so that Kony thing
<Kimori> I'm reading from anotehr journal that its a scam
<Kimori> if it is its hard to believe
<Iago> hurr

<Iago> I'm fucking tired
<SilverSonic> who is Zealot, does he go by another name?
<Iago> Fluorine
<NightSeas> 12anyhow, I forgot to turn off that script before I went idle
<SilverSonic> .
<SilverSonic> oh that guy.
<Iago> don't do it again
<Iago> yeah
*CrazyPresea slaps Fluorine around a bit with a large trout
<Iago> I know Drake is sick of him too
<Iago> Fluorine on here is his eggdrop
<Iago> which he doesn't use
<Rhyme> he's gotten much more annoying the past couple of weeks, idk
<Rhyme> meh
<Iago> well
<Rhyme> anyway now that it's active here
<Rhyme> WHAT'S UP EVERYONE ;O;
<Iago> if you want him back
<Iago> I can remove the ban
<Iago> and just ban him from this chan
<Iago> in school
<Rhyme> nah i dont mind, he's been being a dick, let him wait
<Iago> watching some lame video
<Iago> Alright
<Iago> it's only 24 hours
<CrazyPresea> what's the lame video about
<NightSeas> 12I won't, I even made sure derpbot was off before I left. It was Zealot that turned it back on I guess :/
<Iago> but hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
<Iago> uh
<Iago> I forgot
<CrazyPresea> that's pretty dull
<Iago> I think it's called "The gods must be crazy" or something
<CrazyPresea> heh
<CrazyPresea> is it B/W
<Iago> nope
<CrazyPresea> everytime my school made us watch stuff it was always from like the 1950s and in B/W
<CrazyPresea> so...... boring...
<Iago> XD
<NightSeas> 12lmao

<Iago> thanks
*Iago hugs
*SilverSonic hugs back
<Iago> bbl
<SilverSonic> okie
<Iago> hm
<Iago> SilverSonic, downloading your upload
<CrazyPresea> what is it anyways
<CrazyPresea> anything usful?
<Iago> star wars stuff
<Iago> god, dropbox's servers are sloooooooow
<CrazyPresea> oh star wars
<CrazyPresea> only watched the movies once in my life
<CrazyPresea> didn't watch all of the 2nd one
<Iago> Ah
<Iago> I like the 3rd episode
<CrazyPresea> ya i liked that one
<CrazyPresea> but i only randomly caught it on tv
<CrazyPresea> haven't been watching tv for the past few years so heh
<Iago> Ah
<Ban> (15:15) <@CrazyPresea> haven't been watching tv for the past few years so heh
<Ban> I say you need to watch some television.
<CrazyPresea> how
<CrazyPresea> i don't have cable
<CrazyPresea> nor satilight and i live about 50 miles from any city in a small town
<CrazyPresea> i do have one of those HD tuners but it picks up maybe 2-3 channels randomly
<Ban> 50 from any city?
<CrazyPresea> and it's just covered with blocky garbage
<Ban> 50 miles*
<Ban> i see.
<Ban> that's why
<CrazyPresea> oh before the switch to digital i got in like 10 channels
<CrazyPresea> but nope they had to force everyone to switch
<CrazyPresea> hmm well it's more like 60miles
<Ban> damn
<Ban> How long have you been in the town?
<CrazyPresea> this town? about 9 months
<CrazyPresea> the last town i was in was about 8miles closer to the city
<CrazyPresea> but reception was still poor
<CrazyPresea> so i never bothered to watch tv
<CrazyPresea> i'm not the type to listen to radios either
<Ban> Good thing the net there is quite fair.
<CrazyPresea> oh it's kinda weird
<Ban> why is that?
<CrazyPresea> you have a choice between 256k dsl, or 12mbps or 20mbps broadband
<CrazyPresea> sure i could get cable out here
<CrazyPresea> but i have no income
<CrazyPresea> i'm on someone else's connectoin
<CrazyPresea> connection*
<CrazyPresea> which just happens to be 256k dsl
<Ban> oh.
<Ban> too bad.
<CrazyPresea> radio's been kinda
<CrazyPresea> annoying as of late
<Ban> lol
<CrazyPresea> the state passed this tax law

<CrazyPresea> radio stations have to pay taxes per song
<CrazyPresea> so it's about
<CrazyPresea> 20-30mins of advertisments
<CrazyPresea> before any songs play
<Ban> that's nonsense
<CrazyPresea> i know
<CrazyPresea> i just said fuck the radio
<Ban> fuck the law
<CrazyPresea> music wasn't any good anyways
<CrazyPresea> we get in about
<CrazyPresea> 5 country music stations
<Drake> 04"Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son-of-a-bitch in space!"
<Ban> ah
<Ban> well, it's hard to get a job in there isn't it?
<Ban> since you're too far away from the city
<CrazyPresea> hardly anything is around.. it's worse then normal
<CrazyPresea> there's alot of empty buildings where stores used to be
<CrazyPresea> heh one of them was converted into a house
<CrazyPresea> it sat there for so long
<CrazyPresea> i guess the town allowed it
<Ban> yah, better to used it than to displayed it.
<Iago> Drake!
<Drake> 04NS
<Drake> 04I'm sorry

<Drake> 04ANYWAY
<Drake> 04Good night people.
<CrazyPresea> gn
<CrazyPresea> ogod
<CrazyPresea> i don't even know what mass effect is
*CrazyPresea is assuming it's like a halo game
<Iago> D:
<CrazyPresea> action roleplaying game
<CrazyPresea> made by BioWare/EA...
<CrazyPresea> oh
<CrazyPresea> it's like fallout
<CrazyPresea> i guess
<Iago> yeah
<CrazyPresea> heh i was addicted to fallout for awhile
<CrazyPresea> after i nuked the town while laughing manically
<CrazyPresea> i didn't really get anymore thrills out of it
<CrazyPresea> i either like games where you can level cities
<CrazyPresea> or if it's in classic rpg style
<CrazyPresea> oh
<CrazyPresea> or w/e the hell harvest moon and the sims fall into
<CrazyPresea> although when i play the sims i make graveyards
*CrazyPresea hide
<CrazyPresea> i've also gotten bad endings on some havest moon games
<CrazyPresea> which is very amusing
<CrazyPresea> harvest moon a wonderful life, if you fuck up enough after having a kid your wife and kid both leave you and the game ends
<CrazyPresea> although honestly you have to be Trying to mess up in those games
<CrazyPresea> to get an ending like that
<CrazyPresea> heh well
<CrazyPresea> you can get the first bad ending easy
<CrazyPresea> by never talking to girls
<CrazyPresea> never get married
<CrazyPresea> you leave the farm and the game ends
<CrazyPresea> the ps2 version of the game is pedo-ish
<CrazyPresea> >_>
<CrazyPresea> you can date a fucking 10 year old
<Iago> ._.
<CrazyPresea> in the other games
<Ban> lol
<CrazyPresea> when you have a kid and he grows up
<CrazyPresea> he can marry that girl
<CrazyPresea> but in the ps2 version
<CrazyPresea> you can marry her
<CrazyPresea> it's just not right
<Iago> o-o
<CrazyPresea> oh you can also have glitched up looking inbred farm animals if your not paying attention
<CrazyPresea> game's so odd
<CrazyPresea> oh and grapes
<CrazyPresea> they grow on trees
<CrazyPresea> in that game
<CrazyPresea> Oh also if you watch tv all the time
<CrazyPresea> a random talking alein plant will come to the farm
<CrazyPresea> alien*
<CrazyPresea> well it's just weird
<Iago> uh what
<CrazyPresea> i know right
<CrazyPresea> you can also befriend a hippy
<Iago> lolwtf
<Ban> lmfao.
<CrazyPresea> but in the game in another wonderful life you play as a girl dating guys in the same town
<CrazyPresea> you can Marry the hippy
<CrazyPresea> idk the game's addicting
<CrazyPresea> been playing it since the snes version
<CrazyPresea> although the n64/ps1 versions are more fun then that game
<CrazyPresea> anyways
<CrazyPresea> http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/15200000/Harvest-Moon-Another-Wonderful-Life-harvest-moon-15246757-800-600.jpg
<Iago> ._.
<CrazyPresea> lol
<CrazyPresea> i've been a fan of harvest moon longer then pokemon has been around i guess
<CrazyPresea> speaking of pokemon
<CrazyPresea> in the n64 game, there's a reference to pokemon in it
<CrazyPresea> if you marry another girl besides karin she'll get married, and have a kid, and her kid wears pikachu baby clothing
<CrazyPresea> kinda funny because the game cameout before the anime for pokemon
<CrazyPresea> heh i'm probably the only harvest moon fan here
<Ban> nope.
<CrazyPresea> orly
<Ban> I'm a fan of harvest moon since gba.
<CrazyPresea> ah
<CrazyPresea> those linked with a wonderful life and another wonderful life
<Iago> 'night

*Xanbreon slaps Iago
<SilverSonic> NS

<Iago> Yeah thanks
<Iago> xD
*Iago hugs
*SilverSonic hugs back XD
<Xanbreon> YEswut
<Xanbreon> I hate notices
<Xanbreon> pm me>>
<Iago> I just PMed you
*Xanbreon slaps Iago around with a large Wailord
<Xanbreon> Fuck sake NS
<Xanbreon> wake up
<Xanbreon> Does xan have to smack a bitch?
*Iago slaps Xanbreon
<SilverSonic> ;___;
<SilverSonic> NS, if you saw what i said on tst then you'll know why im crying now. ;-;
<Iago> o-o?
<Iago> o_O
<SilverSonic> sigh
*Iago hugs SilverSonic
<Iago> What's happened with her this time? >:
*SilverSonic hugs back ;-;
<SilverSonic> she's in that suicidal state of mind again ;__;
<SilverSonic> she thought she was annoying mne
<SilverSonic> me*
<Iago> ._.
<SilverSonic> i tried my best to save her ;-;
<Iago> ow :/
<SilverSonic> but i think this time i failed.
<Iago> Don't think that
<SilverSonic> but it might be true ;________;
<[HJ]Fluorine> Someone went suicidal?
<SilverSonic> dont worry abou tit
<SilverSonic> about it*
<Rolo> Nobody ever successfully commits sideways anymore
<Rolo> Rest easy
<[HJ]Fluorine> [22:57] <SilverSonic> dont worry abou tit
<[HJ]Fluorine> [22:57] <SilverSonic> about it*
<SilverSonic> ?
<[HJ]Fluorine> Suicide is a serious issue, if I can help in some way I will.
<SilverSonic> theres nothing to do really ;-;
<SilverSonic> its only up to me ;-;
<SilverSonic> to save her
<[HJ]Fluorine> There is always the step that is looked upon as cruel, but it works
<[HJ]Fluorine> Call the ploice.
<[HJ]Fluorine> *police
<Rolo> SilverSonic: no offense but, if only you can save her, why are you on IRC instead of doing that
<SilverSonic> im multitasking
<Rolo> I like you already
<SilverSonic> text spamming her and talking on here
<SilverSonic> for advice
<[HJ]Fluorine> If you know her adress, direct the police there.
<[HJ]Fluorine> Now.
<Iago> Police rarely works and only serves to destroy trust
<SilverSonic> ^
<SilverSonic> thats why i refuse to call them
<Iago> How would you feel if your girlfriend called the police on you because you were in a suicidal state of mind?
<Iago> Would you ever trust them again?
<SilverSonic> i wouldnt really know.
<Rolo> That depends
<[HJ]Fluorine> That is an absolute lie.
<Rolo> Do I want to die, or do I want to be saved
<Rolo> If the former, I would be mad
<Rolo> If the latter, I would thank them
<[HJ]Fluorine> ^
<Iago> It does depend
<Iago> but often at the moment it does happen it often will create a rift at the very least
<[HJ]Fluorine> I would not lose any trust at all. I would thank them.
<[HJ]Fluorine> Because they saved my life.
<Iago> That's because you have something to live for
<Rolo> Better create a rift than let them go through with it
<Iago> True dat
<Iago> Often people want to suicide because they're depressed or have nothing to life for, in other words
<Rolo> And since the person in question is talking to someone about it, I'm going with wanting to be saved
<Rolo> If I wanted to die, I wouldn't tell anyone, I would just do it
<Iago> Probably, but still
<Iago> Unless it gets to a really bad stage
<[HJ]Fluorine> I've been down the road of major depression several times. All it takes is a good wake-up slap to get out of it.
<Iago> It's not always that easy
<Rolo> I usually just get over it on my own
<Rolo> Being a guy, suffering in silence, etc.
<Rolo> You know how it is
<[HJ]Fluorine> Actually, it has worked twice before on people I don't even know IRL.
<Rolo> Overall I agree with the whole cop thing, because a) obviously doesn't actually want to die due to talking to people about it, and b) better to create a rift than let them go through with it
<Rolo> Unless you are confident you can pull them out yourself
<SilverSonic> welp
<SilverSonic> i think she really did do it this time ;___;
<SilverSonic> OMG SHE ANSWERED
<SilverSonic> THANK FUCK
<SilverSonic> brb
<SilverSonic> saving her
<Rolo> Good luck
<[HJ]Fluorine> IF it is needed, you can have a friend or someone enrage them. If they're mad, they'll be raging at said person instead of killing themselves. Giving you more time. I've seen this in use before.
<Iago> [15:13] <Rolo> [09:04:28] I usually just get over it on my own [15:13] <Rolo> [09:04:33] Being a guy, suffering in silence, etc. [15:13] <Rolo> [09:04:35] You know how it is
<Iago> I normally do that
<Iago> but
<Iago> sometimes it gets overwhelming
<Iago> I uh
<Iago> snapped 2 years ago
<Iago> blah
<Iago> I need go home
<[HJ]Fluorine> I snapped once, my parents found out. Did not enjoy it, but I'm still alive.
<Iago> so seeya
<Iago> good luck SilverSonic
<SilverSonic> sigh
<[HJ]Fluorine> Any luck>
<[HJ]Fluorine> *?
<SilverSonic> she thinks im mad at her
<SilverSonic> because i was trying to get my point across to her.
<SilverSonic> sigh
<SilverSonic> brb again for a while
<[HJ]Fluorine> SilverSonic
<[HJ]Fluorine> Is she mad at you?
<SilverSonic> no
*Umbreon brushes his teeth with flouride o-o
<[HJ]Fluorine> Fluorine =/= Fluoride

<Suinide> New york toys fair. If that isnt the same thing
<Kimori> ah alright
<Suinide> I need that shit
<Suinide> Im seriously considering spending $170 on one
<Kimori> well expect to pay a lot for it :P
<Kimori> oh really?
<Suinide> No joke
<Suinide> Mhmmm
<Kimori> are you in college right now or did you graduate?
<Suinide> Silly boy
<Kimori> uhh yes?
<Suinide> Im still in high school
<Suinide> Im flattered though
<Kimori> I'm not use to high school kids spending that much on game stuff :P
<Suinide> Only spyro stuff
<Suinide> Other wise ill just take the disk and a few dlc thanks
<Kimori> heh impressive
<Suinide> What is?
<Kimori> that youd be willing to spend that much on spyro
<Suinide> Dont you mean stupid? Not inpressive? :P
<Kimori> I only know of one other person who spends a lot on spyro stuff
<Kimori> why stupid?
<Suinide> Im sure a lot of people would consider me that for spending so much. And selling a chunk of my soul to these things
<Suinide> I think my mom does
<Kimori> well
<Suinide> But its my money so...
<Kimori> youd think otherwise if youve seen some friends of mine
<Kimori> I know a few that are very serious collectors
<Suinide> Probably, i dont have hardley anyone that collects hardcore
<Kimori> well what do you consider hardcore collecting?
<Suinide> Spending $170 or more on a little toy
<Kimori> lol
<Kimori> thats nothing really
<Suinide> That is just barely different than the original
<Kimori> I know someone who spent more than that
<Suinide> I need to make more internet friends :P
<Kimori> for spyro stuff
<Suinide> Nu uh
<Kimori> Did I tell you about my friend who bought a spyro press reporter kit?
<Suinide> Idk what that is
<Suinide> And no
<Kimori> Its a pack of information/pictures sent from the company who made spyro to reporters to write about it
<Kimori> think he spent $700 to buy it
<Suinide> Oh fuck
<Suinide> I imagine it would be worth a lot
<Suinide> To the right people
<Kimori> yep
<Kimori> the best thing in the reporter kit was a glass globe that had the spyro logo inside it
<Suinide> Dammmmmmit
<Suinide> Im jealous now
<Kimori> why?
<Suinide> Want
<Kimori> I doubt youl find one
<Suinide> I know lol
<Kimori> He told me only two have shown up on the internet in the past 10-12 years
<Suinide> Wasnt planning on looking. And thats why
<Kimori> thats when he bought one of em
<Suinide> Oh
<Kimori> er the kit I mean
<Suinide> Ohh
<Suinide> Sooooo

<Suinide> Jesus christ
<Kimori> One of my friends was bidding on this
<Kimori> He lost though :/
<Suinide> How much did he bid?
<Kimori> uhhh
<Kimori> I dont remember
<Suinide> Oh
<Kimori> maybe $325?
<Suinide> Well that went up
<Kimori> yep lots of spyro collectors
<Kimori> it wasnt like this a few years ago
<Kimori> back then you could find some rare spyro stuff cheap
<Kimori> now its so damn expensive
<Suinide> I know
<Suinide> Damn, 27 min left on this special sparkle cynder, $224 though
<Suinide> I could et i cheaper on amazon
<Suinide> Could i make a lower bid on it then it is? No one else has put a bid in
<Kimori> no you cant bid less than whats shown
<Kimori> you could watch it and see if it is relisted at a lower price
<Kimori> But the thing is when you buy these skylanders figures you use em right?
<Kimori> or do you not open them?
<Suinide> I use them. Im aware of what that'll do
<Kimori> Id like to buy two of each if possible
<Suinide> But i never plan on selling any of it, except the ds version when it comes in, gonna sell the game portal and stealth elf
<Kimori> but cant be spending that much cash on that stuff
<Suinide> Mhm
<Kimori> I still havent opened up that ds version of skylanders yet :P
<Suinide> Lol geeze. Oh shit, found one with 2 hours left, $165...
<Suinide> God im soooo tempted
<Kimori> Well if you get it I hope you wrap it in plastic lol
<Suinide> What mean?
<Kimori> do you have a spot where you put your rare figures?
<Suinide> Lol what rare
<Suinide> Thisll be my first "rare" i guess
<Kimori> oh
<Suinide> I dont have any gold or silver or anything
<Kimori> I ment like game stuff in general
<Suinide> Oh. Theyre pretty dang safe
<Suinide> Could be safer though, but yeah believe me id be very careful with her
<Kimori> Most of my collectables are in separate plastic bags
<Suinide> Oo
<Kimori> If you remember the spyro pics I had, they were all wraped in clear bags
<Suinide> I think i do
<Suinide> I think im gonna bid
<Kimori> how much time left?
<Suinide> Hit
<Suinide> Shit
<Kimori> ?
<Suinide> Dont think im gonna bid
<Kimori> I was going to say dont bid until the last 5 seconds
<Suinide> Im to young to make an account...lol
<Kimori> it gives the current bidder time to outbid you
<Kimori> lol
<Suinide> I know
<Kimori> oh yeah, gotta be 18
<Suinide> Fucking lame
<Kimori> Its because you need a checking account/credit card
<Suinide> Yeah
<Kimori> I honestly think its too expensive
<Suinide> Oh well its probably better this way, more skylanders and other stuff
<Suinide> Oh it is
<Suinide> Im just an obsessive whore
<Suinide> :P

<Kimori> I'm bidding on this soon
<Suinide> Whats its importance?
<Kimori> Yoshis island for one
<Kimori> its not the players choice box
<Suinide> Yeaahhhhh im not that big on video games so...explain?
<Kimori> I like having all of my games in the original packaging
<Suinide> Oh i see now
<Kimori> Most of my game collection is in its original case/box
<Suinide> Well...arnt most peoples? Mine are
<Kimori> not really
<Suinide> Oh
<Kimori> most people throw em away
<Kimori> hence why they are collectable
<Suinide> Game boxes?
<Kimori> yep
<Kimori> same for game console boxes
<Suinide> Why......loo
<Suinide> Lol*
<Kimori> a N64 console box can be sold for $20-30 bucks
<Suinide> Oo
<Kimori> The real valuable ones are game consoles youve never heard of
<Suinide> Lol i bet
<Kimori> sorry if I'm boring you :P
<Kimori> I research this stuff because I sometimes sell it at my store
<Suinide> Your not lol im just not sure what your talking about
<Kimori> oh I see
<Suinide> Well i do...not all of it
<Suinide> Bleh
<Suinide> Lol
<Kimori> well
<Suinide> So hows mass effect?
<Kimori> basicly I try to collect whatever is rare/valuable
<Suinide> Hopefully that pays off
<Kimori> it has so far :)
<Suinide> Yay
<Kimori> I havent opened my mass effect copies yet
<Suinide> Oh for the love of
<Kimori> no time to play a whole new game yet :P
<Suinide> Lol
<Kimori> Ive got maybe 10 games I still need to beat
<Suinide> Dang
<Kimori> Vanquish, Ratchet & clank, spyro enter the dragonfly, halo 2
<Kimori> rayman 3d, marioland 3d
<Suinide> I usually beat mine pretty fast, not 100% but still, the story mode once
<Kimori> oh I ment 100%
<Suinide> Ohhh
<Suinide> Lol well i havnt beaten quite a bit 100%
<Kimori> It took me over 1 month to beat the first mass effect 100%
<Suinide> Ouch
<Kimori> and thats playing it daily
<Kimori> actually no I still have a couple things missing
<Suinide> Lol
<Kimori> theres like a ton of side quests
<Kimori> its pretty awesome
<Suinide> I figured
<Kimori> I wouldive gone into ME3 already but Ive heard the ending is real bad
<Suinide> I heard that too
<Kimori> which is a real shame, I thought it was going to be real good...thats why I bought two collector editions >.>
<Suinide> Lol
<Kimori> one to keep one to play just like skylanders :P
<Suinide> :p
<Kimori> but it cost so damn much
<Suinide> You must be in the money
<Kimori> why do you say that?
<Suinide> Do buy two of everything
<Suinide> You buy*
<Kimori> I guess you could say its on the business credit card :P
<Suinide> Lol
<Kimori> I planned on selling the other
<Suinide> I know but still
<Kimori> nah I dont have a lot of cash
<Suinide> Oh hehe
<Kimori> I preordered ME3 last year
<Kimori> I had lots of time to put money aside for it
<Suinide> Lol true
<Suinide> In about to preorder two sick looking games
<Kimori> I wasnt planning to buy a 2nd copy but I heard they stopped making em cause they capped it
<Suinide> Whyd tey do that
<Kimori> I dont think any game company makes collector editions for very long
<Suinide> Ph
<Suinide> Oh
<Kimori> except the Halo series
<Kimori> they make tons of extras so its not worth much
<Suinide> Like legos!
<Kimori> a brand new copy of the first Mass effect collector edition is worth $500+
<Suinide> Damn
<Kimori> I figured if I spent $80 bucks for a collector edition I could flip it by christmas and it will pay for my first copy
<Suinide> Probably
<Kimori> its a win win :)
<Suinide> Smarty panta
<Suinide> Pantssss
<Kimori> But I dont know now cause the game ending is bad
<Kimori> every day when I check the game forums theres so much hate on the game
<Suinide> Oh...hehe
<Suinide> Oo i got a question. Unrelated of course
<Kimori> ?
<Suinide> What do you think of this kony thing?
<Kimori> Ive been seeing it everywhere
<Kimori> I remember some talk about it being a scam
<Kimori> but if it really is its hard to believe
<Suinide> I heard somethin like that
<Suinide> That the organization was using 70% of the money for itself
<Kimori> thats sad..
<Suinide> Quite
<Suinide> God some people i just wanna...uuuhg
<Kimori> yeah that happens lol
<Suinide> Lol
<Suinide> Im probably more extreme though :P
<Kimori> are you planning on getting any new games soon?
<Suinide> Yesssss
<Kimori> like what?
<Suinide> Bioshock infinate and borderlands 2
<Kimori> cool
<Suinide> Infinite*
<Suinide> Do tou want them?
<Suinide> You
<Kimori> I dont have any plans thus far
<Kimori> nah
<Suinide> Aww how come?
<Kimori> I rarly buy games brand new
<Suinide> Ohs
<Suinide> Ever play the first ones of them?
<Kimori> no but I should
<Kimori> havent checked to see if they are at my local gamestop
<Kimori> I want to play rayman orgins
<Suinide> Bioshock is the bomb
<Suinide> I heard that was good
<Kimori> I was going to buy it a few weeks ago but apparently they have a limited edition online
<Kimori> and its not sold in stores
<Suinide> Oo
<Kimori> it comes with some art book
<Suinide> Nice
<Kimori> woah this is wierd
<Suinide> What?
<Kimori> I'm checking my gamestop points card and its showing some games it says I bought
<Kimori> but I didnt actually buy them
<Kimori> and it gave me the points anyway
<Suinide> Uh oh
<Kimori> what do you mean uh oh?
<Kimori> if they wanna give me points randomly I'm fine with that lol
<Suinide> Lol idk i thought it had a bad side
<Kimori> I guess
<Suinide> Idk
<Suinide> I think i better go to bed *yawns*
<Kimori> k cyas
<Suinide> Bai baby
<Swaffy> Derp.

<Iago> DRAKE
<Drake|Away> 04hi NS
<Iago> :D
<Iago> oh yeah Drake
<Iago> I was thinking
<Iago> we could use Avatar as inspiration
<Iago> since that's technically from the future
<Drake> 04yes, like 500 years into the future
<Drake> 04but the tech is modern enough, so sure
<Iago> well
<Iago> the reason it's 500 years into the future
<Iago> is because of the psionics and shit
<Iago> and weaponry isn't actaully that advanced
<Iago> obviously we won't be using the robot fighter thingies
<Iago> Was mostly talking about the vehicles, Drake
<Iago> like the helicopter Trudy flies
<Iago> also
<Drake> 04sure
<Iago> would we be far enough into the future
<Drake> 04So you want a double-rotor aircraft?
<Iago> to have large aircrafts/flying bases?
<Iago> well
<Iago> not exactly flying bases
<Iago> but
<Iago> you know what I mean
<Iago> and well
<Iago> idk
<Iago> I was mostly just looking at concepts
<Drake> 04You mean like the Dragon?
<Umbreon> !attack Iago
<Iago> not paying attention to details
<Nightshadow|VNC> 6Omastar uses 6Blast Burn on Iago! Iago has 17 HP left!
<Iago> the Dragon?
<Iago> no u Umbreon
<Umbreon> hi u
<Iago> ohai
<Drake> 04http://www.pandorapedia.com/human_operations/vehicles/dragon_gunship
<Drake> 04That thing
<Umbreon> yes, now you notice me
<Drake> 04Because yes, I can imagine that
<Drake> 04And it would be cool
<Iago> yeah
<Drake> 04Then yes that would be awesome
<Drake> 04Nothing too larger than that though
<Iago> well
<Drake> 04Because it's kind of pointless to have a flying base
<Iago> would it have enough fuel to last for a month or similar?
<Drake> 04Just punch it out of the sky with missiles
<Iago> well
<Iago> maybe not a month
<Iago> but
<Iago> a lightweight one that's possibly smaller
<Drake> 04Several weeks? Depends on fuel advances and fuel consumption
<Iago> that Rhy, Nathan and Leo can use as a base for missions
<Iago> it'd be cool for them to use one as a mobile mission base
<Iago> and they could also use one after they go into hiding
<Drake> 04I can't imagine a conventional aircraft too much bigger than the Dragon Gunship. It's not practical otherwise
<Drake> 04And no
<Drake> 04Because there'd need to be a crew of at least 5 for a gunship like that
<Iago> wouldn't specifically have to be a gunship
<Iago> mostly aerial support platform
<Iago> or at least a transport one
<Iago> that wouldn't require more than 2-3
<Drake> 04Not to mention when they're on the run, flying around in a gunship that large would set of every radar and aircraft sensor on the continent
<Iago> stealth
<Drake> 04And I'm not even joking
<Drake> 04NS how the hell do you think stealth works?
<Iago> okay i know I know
<Iago> but
<Drake> 04NS look at every stealth aircraft, and you'll see that they're streamlined. A ship that remains stationary, with rotors and blades for lift, just can't maintain stealth at all.
<Iago> I know I know
<Drake> 04I suppose it could have a signal jammer
<Iago> well it'd have to have one
<Drake> 04And with the war going on signals being messed up in a small area wouldn't be too noticable
<Iago> assuming that it'd be suitable enough
<Drake> 04But nevertheless I don't think Rhy, Nathan and Leo would be using a mobile aerial platform by themselves. Maybe with Indie they do, but themselves? no.
<Iago> I'd say that the aircraft(s) would also be used in invasion fleets
<Drake> 04I can see that
<Iago> since they /are/ for dropping off troops and all that
<Drake> 04Command aircraft to coordinate other aircraft or simply the invasion force as a whole
<Iago> and I imagine Rhy, Nathan and Leo and the 2 other teams are dropped off by one of those
<Drake> 04Indie would have several
<Iago> when they invade the communications tower/center
<Iago> the US one, where they leave behind russian materials
<Drake> 04Maybe Rhy, Nathan and Leo can join a special black-ops group for a country that relies on rule-breaking
<Iago> so it's blamed on the russians
<Iago> hah
<Iago> well
<Iago> I imagine they'd be used in large team missions
<Iago> since it's not mobile
<Iago> it'd have to have escort craft, unless it has heavy swivel weaponry
<Iago> could have Rhy as one of the escorters for one mission
<Drake> 04Well look at AVATAR.
<Drake> 04The Dragon Gunship does have swivel weaponry
<Drake> 04Which makes sense seeing it's basically a helicopter
<Iago> You wouldn't let Rhy have one on her fighter ):
<Drake> 04Because it's a fighter jet.
<Drake> 04Fighter jets don't work like that!
<Iago> It can still have one
<Iago> ):
<Iago> doesn't matter
<Iago> anyway
<Drake> 04Helicopters nearly ALWAYS have some sort of swivel turret
<Iago> probably
<Iago> anyway
<Iago> we've already decided on Rhy's
<Drake> 04No swivel guns.
<Drake> 04Rocket pods
<Iago> I don't think the gunships would have too much weaponry
<Drake> 04Folding missile rack
<Iago> because I don't think they'd be too advanced by that stage
<Iago> yes I know
<Iago> but yeah
<Iago> not a whole shitload of weaponry
<Iago> while it'd still be a heavy-weapon classed aircraft
<Iago> it can't be something with over 9000 guns or something
<Iago> because that's unrealistic
<Iago> by 2077 or whatever we decided on, I"ll look it up later
<Iago> it's only around 75 or so years from now
<Drake> 04yeah
<Drake> 04But two computer-controlled automatic gatling guns, several missile pods and guided missiles, and that should do it.
<Drake> 04Maybe with a side gunner or two
<Drake> 04limited long-range weaponry, but perfectly capable of defending itself against hostile ground forces while it deploys
<Iago> probably bombs as well
<Drake> 04One or two
<Iago> TNT etc.
<Iago> well
<Iago> it's still a weapons platform
<Iago> and it'd be liable to do a LOT of air-ground attacks
<Iago> since it'd probably be a half-bomber in a sort of way
<Iago> and well
<Iago> there'd be different classes
<Drake> 04true
<Iago> could probably use a system similar to Star Wars'
<Iago> theta-class, delta-class, alpha-class, etc.
<Asterisk> Google is developing reality augmentation glasses.
<Iago> lolwut
<Asterisk> Yes.
<SilverSonic> o-o
<Iago> Drake
<Iago> http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Galactic_Empire_starship_classes
<Drake> 04Acclamater Assault Ship
<Drake> 04NS, any craft can just be named after anything, then slap some numbers and letters in front or behind it and it looks official
<Iago> Well Drake
<Iago> it'd be nice to create some classes
<Iago> so the order of power is easier to read off
<Drake> 04Choose a theme
<Iago> greek letters
<Drake> 04Weapons, Animals, places, battles, mountains, cities, etc.
<Drake> 04Alrighty
<Iago> or
<Drake> 04That's not overused at all but ok
<Iago> you could do something like
<Iago> assault-class, defender-class, etc.
<Drake> 04Hold up
<Drake> 04Here are some of my examples I've made
<Iago> and greek letters are simple
<Iago> that's why they're used
<Iago> or
<Iago> we could use elements
<Drake> 0422B Incisor helicopter, colloquially known as "The Scissor"
<Iago> or simple numbers but that's boring and hard to remember
<Drake> 0418T Heavyweight
<Asterisk> What the hell are you two talking about
<Iago> 22B, 18T?
<SilverSonic> .
<Drake> 04RIN "Lovecraft" Archer
<Iago> some random fanfic Asterisk
<Iago> and wb SilverSonic
<Iago> Drake
<Drake> 04NS, like I said, random number
<SilverSonic> thanks NS
<Iago> your classes make no sense at all
<Iago> Well Drake
<Drake> 04Just say, "Model 22, Class B"
<Iago> by classes
<Iago> I mean CLASSES
<Iago> So Rhy's was
*Iago checks logs
<Asterisk> 77C Mod 49.
<Iago> Drake
<Iago> Rhy's was/is Theta-class Aetherwing Stealth Intercepter X9450
<Iago> intercepter/interceptor
<Iago> w/e
<Drake> 04Sure
<Drake> 04Let's go with that
<Iago> that's what I have in my logs
<Iago> Class, Model Type, [Stealth], Aircraft Type, Model Number
<Iago> I randomly stuck the class bit in before, Drake, so that can be changed anytime
<Iago> and uh, Model Name not Model Type
<Drake> 04Alright, that works
<Iago> but yeah
<Iago> I'm talking classes
<Iago> not model numbers
<Iago> [19:45:02] <~Iago> greek letters
<Iago> [19:45:07] <Drake> Weapons, Animals, places, battles, mountains, cities, etc.
<Iago> [19:45:14] <~Iago> you could do something like
<Iago> [19:45:23] <~Iago> assault-class, defender-class, etc.
<Iago> so what should we use?
<Iago> animals is weird
<Iago> weapons is kinda redundant and confusing
<Iago> and sounds lame
<Iago> mountains...how would that work Drake?
<Iago> and cities is just sad
<Drake> 04Trebuchet-Class Leviathan Heavy Command Gunship V397
<Drake> 04DAMN that sounds cool
<Iago> actually Drake, we could use something like Fighter-class, Destroyer-class, Executor-class, etc.
<Iago> haha yes
<Iago> class is a bit weird though
<Iago> we could remove that entirely
<Iago> but
<Drake> 04Why would we need that for a command gunship?
<Iago> it'd be easier to identify it though
<Drake> 04Not really.
<Drake> 04Maybe the manufacturer?
<Iago> because the classes would be a certain specifications of things it has and can do
<Iago> No...
<Drake> 04Or the actual name of the craft?
<Iago> No
<Drake> 04Since nearly all aircraft are named by their pilots
<Iago> Leviathan/Aetherwing are the craft names
<Iago> model names
<Iago> basically
<Drake> 04I thought we called it-
<Iago> let me explained it
<Iago> -ed
<Iago> the aircraft is named Skyscraper but the model name is Aetherwing
<Iago> ANYWAY
<Iago> basically
<Iago> something like a Gamma-class fighter would have bare minimum basic weaponry, moderate speeds, basic stealth capabilities, and so on
<Drake> 04If we have a model name why do we need a class?
<Iago> something like a higher Delta-class fighter would have more weaponry with more missiles that can do damage etc.
<Iago> because that's the name
<Drake> 04Because the model has it's own specs and uses
<Iago> the class is for identifying what sort of grade it is
<Iago> put it this way
<Iago> the class is basically the aircraft's grade
<Iago> how well it performs, etc.
<Iago> so basically a Gamma-class aircraft would be expected to lose against a Delta-class aircraft
<Iago> because the Delta-class aircraft is known to have better specs etc.
<Drake> 04Well that's stupid
<Iago> assuming I got the greek letter order correct
<Iago> Oh?
<Drake> 04Who tests the aircraft?
<Iago> manufacturers?
<Drake> 04How can it be accurately tested that they will lose?
<Drake> 04Yes
<Iago> it's not tested that they WILL lose
<Iago> it's their stats that decide the class
<Drake> 04Because a Russian manufacturer will really get the oppurtunity to test it against a US craft
<Iago> No
<Iago> it doesn't need to be tested
<Iago> it's graded via its specs
<Iago> it's estimates
<Drake> 04And the manufacturers all agree on this.
<Drake> 04Highly unlikely.
<Iago> it's international standard.
<Drake> 04More than likely they'd keep the specs quiet to all but the people they're selling them too.
<Iago> besides
<Iago> it's easier to class them
<Iago> makes things easier to identify
<Iago> and models can have different levels of classes
<Iago> so you can have a Delta-class Aetherwing, Gamma-class Aetherwing, etc. etc.
<Iago> besides
<Iago> a lot of aircraft specs ARE made public you know
<Drake> 04You should also realise that that would be a single manufacturer making the same aircraft model over and over again for the entire greek alphabet
<Iago> what?
<Iago> no, I don't think you get it
<Iago> pilots do make modifications
<Iago> and so on
<Iago> while originally something might be classed as a theta-class aircraft
<Iago> it might be raised to a delta-class after it's been modified
<Iago> although that's slightly dodgy
<Iago> but whatever
<Iago> still
<Iago> it makes things easier to identify
<Drake> 04If a pilot makes modifications then it really can't be classified because it's so different from the norm, and there's not saying that they're similar to other "Delta-class" craft
<Iago> are you seriously going to bother remembering the fucking specs of EVERY SINGLE AIRCRAFT we make?
<Iago> okay that's true
<Iago> but still
<Iago> classes aren't extremely specific
<Iago> they're just sort of like "Speed: 1500mph-2000mph" or whatever speed range is possible, and so on
<Iago> for each category
<Drake> 04I can see that happening for each spec (Speed, Fireposer etc.) but for each craft as a whole? No.
<Iago> what
<Drake> 04An Aetherwing might have "Delta-Class" speed, and another Aetherwing might have "Gamma-Class" speed, but I don't see them as entirely worthy of a complete title
<Iago> if you're going to rate the speeds
<Iago> you may as well just put the specific range
<Iago> or do it and then average it out to make a class to actually grade the aircraft
<Iago> in total
<Iago> because it makes no sense to do it for each individual category
<Iago> besides, as I said
<Iago> this makes it easier on us
<Iago> and the readers
<Drake> 04No, it actually makes it more confusing
<Iago> are we going to fucking state the specs of EVERY single fucking aircraft every time it comes up?
<Drake> 04No, but adding "classes" when we already have a "model" is stupid
<Drake> 04You don't see various classes of F-22's do you?
<Iago> by classes, the reader gains a general idea of the specs of the aircraft
<Iago> there's a difference between model and class
<Iago> models are far too specific
<Iago> they're names
<Iago> and require dealing out specs for each
<Drake> 04not really
<Drake> 04"X" model is a stealth aircraft used by the US. "Y" is an air-to-air craft used by the US. "Z" is an air-to-ground craft used by the Russians.
<Iago> model names
<Iago> what part of that
<Iago> don't you understand?
<Iago> they're not TYPES
<Iago> they're NAMES
<Iago> like Raptor, etc.?
<Drake> 04WHY THE FUCK WOULD A MODEL HAVE SEVERAL TYPES WHEN IT IS SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR A CERTAIN GODDAMN ROLE?
<Iago> lolwut?
<Iago> as I said
<Iago> Models
<Iago> are specific
<Iago> Classes give a general idea
<Iago> they're not MEANT to be specific
<Drake> 04But why would a craft need classes
<Drake> 04Why
<Drake> 04Give a general idea of WHAT?
<Iago> because it helps make it easier to recognise what something can do
<Drake> 04But each model of craft has a role. We explain that. Done and dusted. They know what it is meant to do.
<Iago> Yes we do
<Iago> But going into specs and speed? nope
<Iago> we're not going that far
<Iago> by using classes we can give readers a general idea of the craft and not go into detail every single time
<Drake> 04We don't have to by simply mentioning models.
<Drake> 04"This model is a stealth fighter."
<Drake> 04Done. No more needs to be said.
<Iago> yeah, and obviously said stealth fighter is fast or slow?
<Iago> or how much weaponry it has?
<Iago> or what stealth capabilities it has? and so on?
<Drake> 04Now YOU'RE going too in-depth
<Iago> That's what I mean by classes
<Drake> 04Unless the crew is using it, we really don't need to go to in-depth
<Iago> It shows the BASICS of that
<Iago> and gives a GENERAL idea
<Drake> 04Goddamnit NS you're making it far too complex
<Iago> without us having to go into detail every time
<Iago> you're not getting the point
<Iago> lol we spent the last half an hour arguing about this
<Iago> but seriously Drake
<Drake> 04You know what
<Drake> 04Do what you want
<Drake> 04I don't want to keep arguing over something like this.
<Iago> you're an asshole Drake :)
<Drake> 04As are you
<Iago> feeling's mutual then
*Iago hugs Drake
*Drake hugs back
<Iago> we need to make some model names and such
<Drake> 04I'd rather not right now
<Drake> 04After Mass Effect 2, I need some violent, mindless killing.
<Drake> 04Mass Effect 3*
<Drake> 04And I need to work on DoI
*Iago stabs Drake
<Iago> no u
<Drake> 04May hasn't responded to me in ages, which is pissing me off because she was meant to write the next chapter, which I now have to do.
<Drake> 04I want to keep writing, but I'm not sure if using her characters without her to oversee it is really right.
<Drake> 04Problem is, I've integrated them into the story far too much to change it now
<Drake> 04I also have a feeling she doesn't see the story as seriously as I do.
<Iago> that's the problem with co-authoring
<Drake> 04If it's IRL it's not that bad.
<Drake> 04And online as long as you have a good way to stay in contact...
<Drake> 04But damn I'm pissed off
<Drake> 04I spent 3 years planning this, ironing out every kink and plothole
<Drake> 04I'm not giving up on it.
<Drake> 04Even if I can't do anything with it, I want it written.
<Iago> .-.
<Iago> well
<Iago> write it then
<Iago> you don't have to post it
<Drake> 04I am. Slowly.
<Iago> well
<Iago> good luck
<Iago> I finished Reminiscence
<Iago> after
<Iago> I lost count of how long
<Drake> 04Heh, I'll probably show it to all my friends, but that's about it.
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 042 years?
<Drake> 042 and a half?
<Iago> yeah
<Iago> I didn't exactly plan it though
<Iago> that's why it's so shit :{D
<Drake> 04I overplan things
<Drake> 04as evidenced by DoI
<Drake> 04BUT THE CONTINUITY IS WORTH IT
<Iago> well
<Iago> I was noobish when I first started Reminiscence
<Iago> and it was my first proper fic
<Iago> so
<Drake> 04As was I with the first DoI, thus why I re-made it
<Iago> I want to remake Reminiscence
<Iago> except I don't think I'll finish it
<Iago> and I want to do Leader's Legacy
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Just write it on-and-off
<Drake> 04No need to put enormous amounts of time into it
<Iago> that's the thing
<Iago> you /do/ need to put a lot of time into writing fics
<Iago> otherwise your ideas won't flow well
<Iago> if you write it on and off
<Iago> it's not as good
<Iago> when you write fics
<Iago> you get brainwaves and a lot of ideas
<Iago> you need to write them all down
<Iago> into the fic
<Iago> not into dot points
<Iago> you'll still lose your ideas if you do that
<Drake> 04I don't write dot points
<Iago> good then
<Drake> 04I write a 30-page summary about a 30 chapters fanfic
<Iago> summaries
<Iago> don't
<Iago> work
<Drake> 04I find that they do.
<Iago> obviously plotting it will
<Iago> but
<Drake> 04Especially since mine are stupidly detailed
<Iago> the ideas of how to write them
<Iago> is what counts
<Iago> not what you write about
<Iago> but how you write it
<Iago> that's the important part
<Drake> 04I find the "What you write" more important to how much I enjoy writing
<Iago> then just plot it
<Iago> if that's what is important to you
<Iago> if that's all you want to do
<Iago> then there's no need to write out a fic
<Iago> if you're going to do something
<Iago> you may as well go all-out
<Iago> or it'll be for nothing
<Drake> 04I write summaries to remember the plot so I dont' forget key points
<Iago> well duh
<Iago> but that's not the most important part
<Iago> while it's essential you remove plotholes unlike what I did
<Iago> it's still important to remember first and foremost that the writing ideas that you have are the more important factor(s)
<Drake> 04I know that
<Drake> 04But I'm a continuity nerd
<Iago> As am I
<Iago> but I'll usually only write if I have the inspiration to do so
<Iago> because that's when you have the best ideas
<Iago> and when the ideas flow the easiest
<Drake> 04I have so much inspiration during school time it's not funny
<Iago> I don't anymore
<Drake> 04Best way to waste time while still looking like you're doing work
<Iago> but I actually have to do work
<Iago> and I spend time on IRC ;-;
<Drake> 04I still do work of course
<Drake> 04But the IT guys blocked that CGI:IRC link you gave me
<Iago> oh really?
<Iago> google CGI:IRC Login
<Iago> and find one that works
<Iago> mine hasn't been blocked for 4 years :D
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04I don't think I'll bother
<Drake> 04no one's on
<Drake> 04And no one talks
<Iago> highlight people
<Iago> and they do talk
<Iago> get on TST
<Iago> and I want to talk to you
<Drake> 04heh
<Drake> 04I'm always on TST
<Iago> I'm rarely on TST
<Iago> I'm always here
<Iago> oh, fuck my mum
<Iago> just
<Iago> fuck her
<Iago> 'night
<Skylands> 10ai

<Ken> Xanbreon: Hybrid
<Xanbreon> Ah, never looked at that one
<Ken> Iago says she has, but I'm a bit perplexed on how to get farther than ./configure
<Xanbreon> Isnt there a howto in the tarball?
<Ken> Xanbreon: Working on the ./configure part right now, figuring what I should put in there
<Xanbreon> Ken, goodo
<Ken> Now I'm up to the point of copying the corresponding ircd.conf example, just don't know how to/where to copy it

<Chocobo> o.o
<Iago> ohai
<Drake> 04hey
<Drake> 04does anyone here have the ME3 soundtrack?
<Iago> nope Drake
<Iago> lrn2torrent
<Drake> 04I wasn't asking for a torrent
<Drake> 04I just want to know if a certain track is on the soundtrack, but the problem is no one knows the name of it.
<Drake> 04I've checked through all the tracks on youtube but none of them contain it
*Iago shrugs
<Drake> 04bluh
<Drake> 04It's probably bad that I want to write a Mass Effect 3 fanfic
<Iago> .-.
<Drake> 04I already have DoI, Wake, that story you and I still need to write, and CoE
<Drake> 04Although I haven't started on CoE yet. I'm conceptualising with Wake, writing down notes and stuff, and DoI seems like it's beginning to move into full swing.
<Iago> Wake is the psychic guy one, Drake?
<Drake> 04No, Wake is my sci-fi one
<Drake> 04Dunno if I'll ever actually do my psychic one
<Drake> 04And I had another Hunger-Games-like dream last night that inspired storiez
<Drake> 04Except it somehow had Spore, Mass EFfect, and Yu-Gi-Oh in it.
<Drake> 04Dunno how that went together.
<Iago> uh okay
<Drake> 04I blame my friends for the Yu-Gi-Oh part.
<Drake> 04Fucking nerds.
<Iago> heh
<Iago> Sazerac loves Yu-Gi-Oh too
<Iago> I like the games
<Drake> 04Once of them spent over $200 on one card alone. One. Card.
<Iago> .-.
<NightSeas> 12I bet that was one AWESOME card :'D
*NightSeas runs
<Iago> I love yugioh dragons
<NightSeas> 12lol same
<Drake> 04My friend runs a dragon deck, based on the "Dragon's Collide" structure deck or something.
<Drake> 04Seemed pretty cool, what with Red Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon
<Iago> REDMD <3
<Iago> also blackwings
<Drake> 04REDMD beats the regular REDD methinks
<Drake> 04Apparently Red Eyes Zombie is pretty good for a zombie deck, despite being a dragon
<Drake> 04anyway, shower afk
<Iago> same, shower
<Iago> REDD is slightly useless

<Drake> 04Trudy is fucking badass
<Drake> 04"Rogue 1"
<Umbreon> o-o

<Iago> Her death could have actually been more epic though
<Iago> like Tsu`tey's
<Drake> 04More focus on Trudy's death, yeah
<Drake> 04But the way she went out was pretty nice
<Iago> could have been better

<Umbreon> hi Quilava
<Quilava> hi
<Umbreon> how goes?
<Quilava> all right, you?
<Umbreon> i'm fine
<Umbreon> i'm a little amused
<Umbreon> remember when you said you drained one of your oceans?
<Umbreon> in terraria
<Quilava> er. yes
<Umbreon> well
<Umbreon> i'm making an ocean
<Umbreon> or a lake, depending on how technical you wanna be
<Quilava> I didn't 'drain' the ocean, I made a hole from the ocean to hell, and flooded it :|
<Umbreon> yeah i know
<Umbreon> http://i112.photobucket.com/albums/n174/MysticHawk/world3.png
<Umbreon> that was a couple hours ago
<Umbreon> it's still going
<Quilava> you're doing it wrong
<Quilava> you need to put a replicator beneath it
<Umbreon> replicator?
<Quilava> yes. it's a 'pyramid' of blocks that makes water increase its total volume as it passes over it
<Umbreon> ahh
<Quilava> do you know how to make one?
<Umbreon> a pyramid doesn't sound too hard to make
<Umbreon> don't really care though XD
<Quilava> it's not exactly a pyramid
<Umbreon> even if it would make it go by quicker
<Umbreon> i should go to sleep later so adding onto it is a best left for another day
<Quilava> make replicator first
<Quilava> it will speed things up by a lot
<Umbreon> thanks for the tip though Quilava
<Umbreon> it's just that right now it's 12:30 and i should be asleep right now
<Umbreon> no need to get bothered with a project
<Quilava> ah.
<Quilava> it doesn't take long at all :|
<Umbreon> i'm trying to finish watching iron man then i probably will go to sleep
<Quilava> it only has to be as big as you want it to be
<Quilava> okay.
<Umbreon> does it have to be above water?
<Quilava> below
<Quilava> you make it under the waterfall
<Umbreon> i mean
<Umbreon> will it stop working if it's completely submerged underwater
<Quilava> yes
<Umbreon> ok
<Quilava> build it very close to the output
<Dawnfire> HMM
<Umbreon> but yeah Quilava
<Umbreon> i intend to flood the entire world
<Umbreon> all the way upto space
<Quilava> awesome

<Ran> 02Lolol
<Umbreon> gah
<Umbreon> here we go again
<Viri> 14Umbreon :D
<Umbreon> hi
<Ran> 02!pokemon
<ScriptBot> Ran, you are a 7Regirock.
<Ran> 02No :'<
<Viri> 14lol Ran, it's the exact opposite for me. For a while I've been going to bed very early and wake up late x.x
<Viri> 14I need 5 hours of sleep and nothing more D:
<Viri> 14brain, y u troll me
<Ran> 02I wish I was sleeping for only five hours, I perform best that way
<drf|work> LOl really?
<Viri> 14yeah
<Viri> 14but in these days I've been sleeping way too much :/
<Viri> 14I went to sleep at 8.30pm yesterday
<Viri> 14and I woke up at 6.30am
<Viri> 14x.
<Viri> 14*x.x
<Ran> 02I have to try getting up earlier really...I'm just so bad at it
<Viri> 14I have the alarm clock set at 5.25am
<Ran> 02Hey, that's about when I go to sleep :D
<Viri> 14but recently I just wake up, look at it, turn it off and go back to sleep :(
<Viri> 14<- lazy flygon
<Umbreon> gah
<Ran> 02And that's why I don't have an alarm clock lol
<Umbreon> vista why are you doing this to me
<drf|work> >Vista
<drf|work> want a free Windows 7?
<Umbreon> i still have your free windows 7 lol
<drf|work> so why are you still using Vista/
<Viri> 14I'd love to, but I can't format :(
<Umbreon> because i don't want to waste gold on a trashy computer
<drf|work> why can't you format
<Viri> 14I have too much stuff and not enough space on my external HD
<Ran> 02Even though it's all Greek to me, which is the best Windows anyway
<Umbreon> something funny is happening
<Umbreon> ever since i upgraded
<Umbreon> it bluescreens at startup
<drf|work> Viri, back them up to dropbox or somewhere? :P
<Viri> 14I'd upload all into Box, but I don't know if all the stuff will remain private x3
<Viri> 14I have 50gb free
<Umbreon> i'll just run the startup repair and what
<Umbreon> it sat there for 2 seconds and said "please restart computer to finish" XD
<drf|work> Viri, then delete it after
<drf|work> LOL
<Umbreon> and still didn't fix the problem
<Viri> 14lol
<Viri> 14well drf, if you will help me when I'm done with moving everything then sure :3
<drf|work> sure
<drf|work> also Umbreon
<Viri> 14great :D
<drf|work> that's why you don't upgrae
<drf|work> *upgrade
<drf|work> you do fresh installs
<Umbreon> i mean
<Umbreon> update
<Umbreon> windows updates
<Umbreon> so drf
<Umbreon> do you have a separate key for windows 7
<drf|work> I have that one :P
<drf|work> and if I sign up for TechNet I can get more
<Umbreon> the one from before i see XD
<Umbreon> i want to be funny here
<Umbreon> how does microsoft see VMs?
<drf|work> as new computers.
<Umbreon> okay XD
<Viri> 14http://i.qkme.me/3ofrjn.jpg
<Umbreon> so i can't be sneaky and technically say "how many computers is this installed on"
<Umbreon> and say "one" when it's installed on a computer and then i have a VM of it
<Umbreon> drf
<drf|work> ?
<Umbreon> what was that site called again
<Umbreon> dreamspark or something
<drf|work> yes
<Umbreon> i have an account with it
<Umbreon> so x-x
<Umbreon> i don't think i can grab multiple copies of an OS though
<drf|work> make another account :P
<drf|work> but they only have the server OSes anyway
<Umbreon> nah
<Umbreon> i downloaded 7 from it before
<drf|work> wait
<drf|work> what
<drf|work> Dreamspark doesn't have 7
<drf|work> unless you mean MSDNAA
<drf|work> (DreamSpark Premium, same thing)
<Umbreon> maybe that was it
<drf|work> MSDNAA is awesome
<Umbreon> gah why did i delete that email
<drf|work> that's where my 7 key came from too
<Umbreon> gah
<Umbreon> no matter where i go
<Umbreon> dreamspark doesn't think my account exists
<Umbreon> why did i destroy that link XD
<drf|work> yeah, mine does that sometimes too x.x
<Umbreon> well i held onto the email for the longest time
<Umbreon> i should have just bookmarked them though
<Umbreon> i know the link was like onthehub.blahblah
<Umbreon> this is why i just like using the OEM of a computer, so i don't have to go through this trouble
<Umbreon> i'd rather not use the same key as i did with my other computer
<Umbreon> i am so confused, vista just started up normally, i didn't even do anything
<Umbreon> hi Quilava

<HyperMetalLugia> hmmhiii
<Rukario> vista is being trashy to me :D
<Rukario> funny enough linux isn't though
<HyperMetalLugia> get 7.
<HyperMetalLugia> Lol
<Rukario> how many times do i have to say this
<Rukario> i don't want to waste money on that crappy laptop
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF has his free 7? LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> Fine, install Win2k or Xp
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Rukario> no, drf has a free 7 that involves giving me a product code he already gave me for the installation for my desktop computer
<Rukario> i can't look microsoft in the face and say it's only installed on 1 computer when it's actually installed on 2 :P
<HyperMetalLugia> I have a spare pro key
<HyperMetalLugia> I think
*HyperMetalLugia should look for laptops to steal Win7Pro keys from :D
<Rukario> besides i think i just fixed the problem
<Rukario> somehow installing service pack 1 fixed it XD
<HyperMetalLugia> See
<HyperMetalLugia> Vista Sp1 is amazing
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean
<HyperMetalLugia> }NOW SP2 TIME

<Chimera> Sup
<Chimera> I'm in phys ed xD
<drf|work> back
<drf|work> and LOL, hi Chimera
<drf|work> so I found out, TechNet has a limit of 3 product keys per product, whereas MSDN is 10
<drf|work> neither is unlimited :/
<drf|work> but hm
<drf|work> it's $350 for TechNet Professional which includes MS Office, compared to $800 for MSDN Operating Systems which doesn't
<Chimera> Hih.
<Chimera> Huh.
<drf|work> Chimera
<drf|work> MSDN and TechNet are Microsoft subscriptions that let you get essentially every operating system they make
<drf|work> plus other stuff.
<Chimera> K
<Viri> 14uhm
<Viri> 14drf
<Viri> 14I ran the Win 7 compatibility advisor
<Viri> 14it tells me that my RAM might be a problem
<Viri> 14I have 1.9gb of ram
<Viri> 14ò_ò
<HyperMetalLugia> that is fine.
<HyperMetalLugia> LOL
<HyperMetalLugia> my laptop came with 2GB
<HyperMetalLugia> Win7 works on even 1GB
<Viri> 14uhm ok then
<HyperMetalLugia> you only need like 500-600MB really
<HyperMetalLugia> ;p
<Viri> 14I'm going to back up the most important stuff and send it onmy Box/Dropbox accounts
<ctr> Win7 works on 256MB if you use certain hacks
<drf|work> yeah, I've used 7 on 1GB
<ctr> you'll get a huge pagefile anyway
<ctr> if you actually plan to use your computer
<Rukario> rawr, vista service pack 2 download faster
<drf|work> LOL pagefiles
<drf|work> EW VISTA
<Rukario> pff
<ctr> EW NT 6 SERIES
<Rukario> -.- it's not bad when it's only being used as a linux backup
<Rukario> to be honest
<Rukario> this computer would be full linux
<ctr> Windows can't read ext4 filesystems
<Rukario> if i could figure out a way to use action replay within linux
<HyperMetalLugia> It can read Ext3/2
<Rukario> ctr it's a duel boot i mean
<Rukario> if i come across a compatibility issue with linux with certain applications
<Rukario> i just move over to vista
<HyperMetalLugia> You'll have tons of those.
<HyperMetalLugia> :v
<Rukario> correction
<ctr> I'd use XP for such purposes
<Rukario> if i have a compatibility issue
<Rukario> i'd use my XP VM
<Rukario> and if i still can't get work done then i'll use vista
<ctr> But Vista is not a good OS for compatibility stuff
<Rukario> it works for me
<Rukario> plus
<Rukario> i'm not wasting money on the laptop to put winodws 7 on it
<Rukario> i'd rather waste a 7 key on a laptop that actually works
<Rukario> and isn't on it's knees

<Drake> 04expectant
<Skylands> 10who's your fav character so far?
<Drake> 04and worried all at once
<Drake> 04I kind of like Sayaka
<Skylands> 10and good, that's how I want you to feel.
<Drake> 04But that girl (I can't remember her name) who attacked Kyubey is also pretty cool
<Skylands> 10Homura
<Skylands> 10You know my favourite character
<Kyu> 07http://tacocopter.com/
<Skylands> 10but I dislike Madoka and Sayaka
<Kyu> 07one of these days
<Skylands> 10Homura and Mami are my other two faves
<Drake> 04Yes I know your favourite character XD
<Drake> 04When does she appear?
<Kyu> 07I'm gonna go to SF just to order a taco

<Skylands> 10:P
<Skylands> 10Anyway, time for me to stop annoying you so you can focus on Puella

<Drake> 04Skylands
<Drake> 04http://www.animeseason.com/to-aru-kagaku-no-railgun/
<Drake> 04WATCH THIS
<Drake> 04I COMMAND YOU
<Skylands> 10What's it about?
<Drake> 04It's about a city in Japan, called Academy City, which is compromised mostly of students.
<Drake> 04However, most students are "Espers", people with various psychic powers.
<Drake> 04The story is about the 3rd most powerful level 5 (the highest level) Esper, Misaka Mikoto, and her friends.
<Drake> 04The main series is To Aru Majutsu No Index, which Railgun is split from
<Drake> 04There also happens to be loads of characters
<Drake> 04"Railgun" happens to be one of Misaka's abilities using her power, "Electromaster"
<Skylands> 10Espers
<Skylands> 10sounds like The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<Drake> 04XD
*Skylands adds it to her To-Watch lsit
<Skylands> 10list*
<Drake> 04Railgun deals with science, Index deals with magic
<Drake> 04and eventually, (at least in the light novels), the two begin to clash
<SilverSonic> o.o
<Drake> 04Personally I prefer Railgun
<Skylands> 10Science rulez
<Skylands> 10</Bill Nye the Science Guy>
<Drake> 04XD
<Drake> 04Granted
<Drake> 04it's mostly Techno Babble rather than actual science
<Drake> 04but the series is more enjoyable
<NightSeas> 12Did you know ice is frozen water?! Gasp
<Drake> 04Did you know water is wet?
<Skylands> 10Girls are too
<Drake> 04Oooooooh Skylands it getting kinky.
*Skylands trollface
<Drake> 04is*
<Drake> 04Man
<Drake> 04I just realised
<Drake> 04I can't watch anime at the moment
<Kenji> heh
<Kenji> that sucks
<Drake> 04We're almost over our limit for this month of downloads
<Skylands> 10Okay
<Kenji> no 2d girls for you drake
<Skylands> 10Also Drake
<Drake> 04Unfortunately no :<
<Drake> 04Yah?
<Skylands> 10You seem very interested to see Ascendant get kinky. I wonder how you would react if I started acting super kinky
*Skylands shot
<Kenji> heh teenagers
<Skylands> 10heh Kenji
<Skylands> 10who I think might be Presea
<Kenji> yep
<Kenji> i think i'm presea too
<Drake> 04[09:04] <%Skylands> You seem very interested to see Ascendant get kinky. <- You seem to misunderstand. Whenever NS gets kinky I freak my shit.
<Kenji> not 100$ sure though
<Kenji> 100%
<Kenji> 100$ would be nice too
<Drake> 04And if you got super kinky I'd be wondering what was up first.
<Skylands> 10lolwhy Drake?
<Drake> 04Because honestly NS scares me when she gets all weird like that. Plus I could never see us two doing that.
<Kenji> scares you
<NightSeas> 12[16:02] <%Skylands> Girls are too
<NightSeas> 12;3
<Skylands> 10NightSeas is to- I mean what
<Drake> 04XD
<NightSeas> 12Oh there’s no proof :D
<Drake> 04And honestly Skylands
<Drake> 04You're a nice girl and all I pretend to be sexually interested in you, but if it actually comes to you wanting to be kinky I'd turn you down.
<Kenji> pretend
<Angel_Espeon> 13Oh wow it's Friday today
<Angel_Espeon> 13I keep thinking it's Thursday
<SheenaFox> yep
<SheenaFox> I kept thinking yesterday was Friday
<SheenaFox> but it wasn't

<SheenaFox> !Espeon
*Espeon now belongs to SheenaFox for 15 minutes
<Drake> 04Well
<Angel_Espeon> 13also SHEENAAAAA
<Skylands> 10Pretend is more fun than actually trying
*Angel_Espeon floofs Sheena
<SheenaFox> ANGEEEEEEEL
<Kenji> wouldn't know to be honest
*SheenaFox floofflfoflfofooolffolf
<Skylands> 10since that could go in two different directions
<Drake> 04In all honestly I think you're attractive, but no I would't pursue you.
<Kenji> as i do neither
<Angel_Espeon> 13:DDD
<Drake> 04I walk in

*Drake pets Angel
<Drake> 04Dunno
*Iota loves NS :>
<NightSeas> 12NS scares everyone
<Kenji> doesn't scare me
<Kenji> heh
<Iota> Personality and such
<Drake> 04She intimidates me all the goddamn time, and because of her...abrasive personality I don't think anything like that could happen between us

<drf|laptop> 03wait
<drf|laptop> 03what
<drf|laptop> 03triple trouble?
*Chimera paws Skylands
<Chimera> YES
<drf|laptop> 03what's that

<Chimera> GG as in Game Gear
<Skylands> 10mew
<drf|laptop> 03I know what Game Gear is
<drf|laptop> 03also wtf
<Chimera> l
<Chimera> k
<drf|laptop> 03the Droid 4
<Skylands> 10for a minute I thought mewtwo was a script there
<drf|laptop> 03has an internal SD card
<drf|laptop> 03so there's like
<drf|laptop> 03two of them
<drf|laptop> 03and it's screwing everything up
<drf|laptop> 03since the *real* MicroSD
<Skylands> 10...
<drf|laptop> 03is called "sdcard-ext"
<drf|laptop> 03so all these programs are just putting their backup files in /sdcard
<Skylands> 10Why didn't I notice that before
<drf|laptop> 03which isn't actually an SD card
<drf|laptop> 03brilliant logic, right?

<Skylands> 10Best song
<Chimera> The 3DS doesn't cache its videos propperly
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 something re...yeah k
<Chimera> so if you try to turn back
<Skylands> 10Is it Huge Hallow mix/
<Skylands> 10?*
<Chimera> in the video to let it buffer
<Chimera> NOPE
<ctr> lack of RAM
<Iota> no, don't have that one
<drf|laptop> 03haven't we been over the fact that the 3DS is a failure of a console?
<ctr> there's only 128mb
<Chimera> yup
<ctr> what do you expect
<drf|laptop> 03and whose fault is that ctr
<drf|laptop> 03they could have easily put more
<Chimera> eh
<Chimera> maybe
<drf|laptop> 03basically Nintendo's new creedo is like
<Chimera> if they didn't TRY to make it so small
<ctr> nintendo prefers faster memory
<drf|laptop> 03"Let's make the best software we can on the incredibly bad hardware... made for us"
<ctr> instead of larger memory
<drf|laptop> 03er
<drf|laptop> 03*made by us
<drf|laptop> 03or, get better faster memory?
<drf|laptop> 03*cough* DDR3 1600MHz or whatnot *cough*
<ctr> greediness
<Chimera> lol
<drf|laptop> 03exactly
<ctr> nintendo uses Toshiba FCRAM
<drf|laptop> 03but it seems what Nintendo does lately
<drf|laptop> 03is make the crappiest hardware possible and then try their hardest (usually failing) to make a good user experience for said crappy hardwrae
<drf|laptop> 03*ware
<NightSeas> 12too bad Sato isn't here. lmao
<drf|laptop> 03the Wii was really what started that
<drf|laptop> 03since they essentially took the GameCube hardware and made it wireless
<drf|laptop> 03and added widescreen
<drf|laptop> 03but it's not any better quality LOl
<ctr> slightly better because of higher clocked graphics
<ctr> that's all
<drf|laptop> 03but it's still not much better either way
<drf|laptop> 03the original DS was good for its time but they just kept using the same crap for all of them, the DSi and DSi XL
<ctr> good for its time?
<ctr> Not really
<ctr> when sony showed the PSP
<drf|laptop> 03better graphics than the GBA
<ctr> DS looked like stone age
<drf|laptop> 03that's true, but the PSP doesn't have a touch screen :P
<drf|laptop> 03they're each good for their own things
<drf|laptop> 03and the PSP screen kinda sucks, it has motion blur
<ctr> so did the gameboy line
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah, I have both consoles, either way
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03the gameboys used TFTS, didn't they?
<drf|laptop> 03*TFTs
<drf|laptop> 03but by the time DS/PSP was around they easily could have uesd LCDs
<drf|laptop> 03and I think the DS did
<ctr> gameboy used dot matrix
<ctr> something
<Chimera> drf yeah
<drf|laptop> 03how is that different than TFT?
<Chimera> The DS' dual screen design is like
<Chimera> really cool
<drf|laptop> 03exactly
<Chimera> but the hardware's old :/
<drf|laptop> 03I remember going "LOL two screens, why?"
<drf|laptop> 03but when it came out
<drf|laptop> 03I was super excited
<Chimera> The 3DS has better hardware but
<drf|laptop> 03but barely
<Chimera> it's not exactly that innovative
<drf|laptop> 03well
<ctr> the 2 screens aren't identical
<drf|laptop> 03not only that
<drf|laptop> 03wait
<ctr> kinda ruins the dual screen thing of the DS
<drf|laptop> 03on what
<Chimera> drf at least the 3DS supports specular mapping
<Chimera> XP
<drf|laptop> 03they *were* identical
<drf|laptop> 03on the DS
*Chimera runs
<drf|laptop> 03DS Lite screwed that up
<Chimera> ctr a littl
<Chimera> little
<Chimera> eh
<Chimera> ?
<ctr> 3DS has nice hardcoded shaders
<drf|laptop> 03the DS touchscreen is the same as the top screen with a little plastic thingy over it to make it touch sensitive
<Chimera> DS lite looks like it has similar screens...
<ctr> that's pretty much all
<drf|laptop> 03if anything
<drf|laptop> 03the DS Lite looked like it had *bigger* screens
<drf|laptop> 03just due to the ratio
<Kenji> http://www.vgcats.com/comics/images/120318.jpg
<drf|laptop> 03of plastic to screen XD
<NightSeas> 12the 3DS does have widescreen though XD
<Kenji> heh don't think ME3 can be any good if i keep finding stuff like this
<ctr> Not the touch screen
<Chimera> on the top screen
<drf|laptop> 03barely, NightSeas
<NightSeas> 12which to me is a good thing
<ctr> and that's a big flaw
<Chimera> anyway
<drf|laptop> 03it's not 16:9
<Chimera> I have to go
<Chimera> :c
<drf|laptop> 03I don't think anyway
<drf|laptop> 03@calc 400/24o0
<drf|laptop> 03er
<junh1024-XD> = 16.666667
<NightSeas> 12it is
<ctr> since the touch screen scratches the top screen
<drf|laptop> 03@calc 400/240
<Chimera> yeah it's a weird ratio
<junh1024-XD> = 1.666667
<NightSeas> 12almost
<drf|laptop> 03yeah it's narrower
<ctr> it's 5:3
<Chimera> ctr that happens to me alllll the time
<Chimera> anyway
<drf|laptop> 03and :< bye Chimera
<Chimera> LATER :V
<NightSeas> 12bye Chimew
<ctr> bai
<NightSeas> 12The 3DS also has the analog circle pad
<drf|laptop> 03the circle pad is kinda obnoxious
<ctr> i lose my grip of that all the time
<drf|laptop> 03Sonic Generations is literally the *only* game I've played that I like that uses it
<drf|laptop> 03the rest of them IR'd prefer the D-pad
<drf|laptop> 03*i'd
<NightSeas> 12it's better on MK7
<ctr> pilotwings and mario kart forces you to use the circle pad
<drf|laptop> 03no it's not
<drf|laptop> 03MK DS was awesome
<drf|laptop> 03pilotwings is stupid
<drf|laptop> 03I rented that game
<ctr> I play MKDS with dpad
<drf|laptop> 03hated it
<drf|laptop> 03exactly
<drf|laptop> 03MKDS is awesome
<NightSeas> 12the D-pad on MK DS hurt my fingers :<
<ctr> a year ago
<ctr> MKDS was the worst game ever
<ctr> now it's awesome
<NightSeas> 12MK DS was awesome, and is awesome
<ctr> Too bad i can't play online on that anymore
<ctr> WEP...
<ctr> my network is WPA2
<drf|laptop> 03that's why you just make another hotspot
<drf|laptop> 03I've go ttwo set up
<drf|laptop> 03one has WPA2
<drf|laptop> 03the other has WEP and doesn't broadcast its SSID
<Rukario> XD
<ctr> my laptop's wifi board doesn't support adhoc connections
<drf|laptop> 03wait what?
<drf|laptop> 03you use your laptop as a router?
<ctr> no, i have a router
<drf|laptop> 03so what does adhoc connections have to do with anything
<ctr> but it's wireless
<drf|laptop> 03so i smine
<drf|laptop> 03The actual router itself supports up to 5 SSIDs LOL
<drf|laptop> 03and if it can run dd-wrt, so can that
<ctr> mine can't
<ctr> cisco epc2425
<drf|laptop> 03why not just switch it to WEP then?
<ctr> Insecure
<drf|laptop> 03dude, everything is insecure with aircrack
<ctr> everything here relies on it
<ctr> my computer's conneccted to it wirelessly
<drf|laptop> 03the general idea is just to put *a* password on it, so that people would connect to an unesecure one instead

<Iota> Supposed to be the roflmao thing
<drf|laptop> 03unless they personally hated me or something XD
<NightSeas> 12XD
<ctr> my SSID means "poop" in swedish so people try to hack it all the time
<drf|laptop> 03well then try not doing that?
<drf|laptop> 03I named mine "DON'T STEAL MY BANDWIDTH" and put WEP on it, never had any problems
<ctr> i couldn't come up with anything better
<drf|laptop> 03that was my router in college
<drf|laptop> 03when I'm at home, the router here is just my last name
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<drf|laptop> 03I wonder why windows 7 can't rename a removable drive using lowercase letters
<drf|laptop> 03the actual partitions support them
<drf|laptop> 03but it just allcaps them
<drf|laptop> 03Windows XP can rename them, but that apparently only renames it on the local computer and not the disk iteslf
<drf|laptop> 03since it turned back into caps on another machine
<ctr> use linux to rename them
<drf|laptop> 03I can't
<drf|laptop> 03I used Linux to make the original one
<drf|laptop> 03but the problem is
<drf|laptop> 03for some reason
<drf|laptop> 03gparted doesn't show it
<drf|laptop> 03it mounts the device but if I open it in gparted, it shows as entirely unpartitioned o_O

<drf|laptop> 03and I can't figure out how to properly rename it

<Kyu> 07how do they work

<SheenaFox> XD
<Kyu> 07MAGNETS HOW DO THEY WORK
<drf|laptop> 03She was talking about being "third double"
<drf|laptop> 03and I was like
<drf|laptop> 03why are they ranking players
<drf|laptop> 03and I didn't know how "team" tennis works
<drf|laptop> 03given that it's an individual sport
<drf|laptop> 03so I let her explain the whole
<drf|laptop> 03some poeple play by themselves, others play with partners, etc

<drf|laptop> 03well, the part tha tI really didn't get, was how the entire team wins or loses
<SheenaFox> I mean it's cool
<drf|laptop> 03which kinda su\cks
<drf|laptop> 03it happens to my dad a lot
<SheenaFox> but like
<drf|laptop> 03he'll win his match
<Angel_Espeon> 13yes, it's always better if you've got someone else to do the playing with
<drf|laptop> 03but the team loses
<Angel_Espeon> 13:3c
<SheenaFox> It's the same for most of the game
<drf|laptop> 03my sister hates singles too
<SheenaFox> Doubles is a lot more spontaneous :'D
<SheenaFox> I don't hate singles
<drf|laptop> 03she refuses to play singles XD
<SheenaFox> LOL
<drf|laptop> 03she's like "I want a partner or I don't want to play"
<SheenaFox> lol her coaches let her do that
<drf|laptop> 03well it also gives her a bit of an excuse to not practice
<drf|laptop> 03"oh, my partner is busy, sorry"
<SheenaFox> ours are like, "go with what we choose unless you're dying"
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03they do that too
<drf|laptop> 03they put her on doubles
<drf|laptop> 03like technically she had no say
<drf|laptop> 03but she hates singles regardless
<SheenaFox> oh XD
<drf|laptop> 03so she was glad to be put on doubles XD
<drf|laptop> 03but I'm like
<drf|laptop> 03OK

<SheenaFox> Doubles depends on your partner
<drf|laptop> 03but then

<drf|laptop> 03I was like, i'd want to be the lowest one
*drf|laptop runs
<SheenaFox> the thing is it's illegal to rearrange your ladder so you win
<SheenaFox> you usually have to order it according to your ranking on the team
<drf|laptop> 03yeah but I mean
<drf|laptop> 03when they rank you at first
<SheenaFox> or else you would just put the best player last and win all the time
<drf|laptop> 03what if you just intentionally play crappy

<drf|laptop> 03assuming you're on a team, at least

<drf|laptop> 03Just signed up for a TechNet Professional subscription :D
<drf|laptop> 03found a coupon to get 15% off, too
<NightSeas> 12nice
<drf|laptop> 03ew they charge tax
<NightSeas> 12um, why would a online store charge tax? XD
<Kyu> 07because it's slowly becoming law lol
<drf|laptop> 03which is stupid
<Kyu> 07not really
<NightSeas> 12orly
<junh1024-XD> http://i.imgur.com/PeoNg.jpg
<drf|laptop> 03it's stupid because I'm cheap and don't like tax
*drf|laptop runs
<Skylands> 101oh u
<NightSeas> 12^
<NightSeas> 12XD
<Skylands> 10it didn't work
<drf|laptop> 03but yeah
<drf|laptop> 03Amazon FTW because like
<Skylands> 10oh u
<drf|laptop> 03they exploit this loophole
<Kyu> 07it's not just because states want to charge tax, it's because a lot of illegal tax dodging happens with online stores
<drf|laptop> 03so that they don't have to charge tax
<drf|laptop> 03Yep
<drf|laptop> 03*cough*
<drf|laptop> 03Amazon charges tax if you live in New York because they have a distribution center there
<drf|laptop> 03so you have to buy from a third party, and then you don't need to pay tax XD
<Kyu> 07that loophole is gonna be closed soon enough lol
<drf|laptop> 03I know, the world is slowly coming to an end anyway
<drf|laptop> 03>Chasing after pirates when there are much worse things to worry about
<drf|laptop> 03also wtf
<drf|laptop> 03We're sorry, the following error(s) have occurred:
<drf|laptop> 03Credit Card information is invalid.
<drf|laptop> 03no it's not
<drf|laptop> 03>_>
<NightSeas> 12Taxes will hurt the online market because then you have shipping + taxes
<Kyu> 07oh right
<Kyu> 07I forgot to tell you I stole it
*Kyu runs
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03Kyu
<drf|laptop> 03someone actually *did* steal it
<drf|laptop> 03hence why I had to get a new card

<Kyu> 07you'll get the boat in 6-8 weeks
<Kyu> 07happy birthday
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03I can try it as an e-check
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Kyu> 07did they restrict online purchases with the new one?
<drf|laptop> 03nope
<Kyu> 07you could check
<drf|laptop> 03I just deposited a check, it's possible that I can't actually use that money until tomorrow
<drf|laptop> 03even though they emailed me saying the transaction went throug
<drf|laptop> 03h
<Kyu> 07that's how mine are set up
<drf|laptop> 03and I didn't have enough in there before
<drf|laptop> 03I'll just do it as an echeck
<drf|laptop> 03it's odd though
<drf|laptop> 03Xbox Live will take paypal but Microsoft themselves won't?
<drf|laptop> 03they only do credit card/echeck
<drf|laptop> 03wait what
<Kyu> 07I don't see many transactions with microsoft themselves happening too often
<drf|laptop> 03they want me to actually mail a check
<drf|laptop> 03yeah but doesn't the money all go to the same place?
<Kyu> 07they probably don't want paypal to take a percentage lol
<drf|laptop> 03and I dunno if TechNet is "Microsoft themselves" :P
<Kyu> 07paypal is more convenient, so they'd only accept in in applications that convenience is more important
<drf|laptop> 03Yeah I know what you mean
<drf|laptop> 03And I think PayPal charges a fee for people to be able to use them as a billing source
<Kyu> 07yep
<Kyu> 07also they're copying Square now lol
<drf|laptop> 03hm?
<Kyu> 07that device you plug into your phone to accept credit cards
<Kyu> 07and they take a percentage
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03oh, that's why
<drf|laptop> 03the check I just deposited isn't "available balance"
<Kyu> 07they don't let you use part of it right away?
<drf|laptop> 03nope
<drf|laptop> 03it's weird though'
<drf|laptop> 03I used the Chase mobile app, where you can photograph the check and whatnot
<drf|laptop> 03then they were like "we'll email you when it's approved"
<drf|laptop> 03then they emailed me 20 mins later saying it's approved o.o
<Kyu> 07oh lol
<Kyu> 07approved and processed are different XP
<drf|laptop> 03"I'll look her up in the phone book... I mean, how many Lopez's can there be in LA? ...Can you just give me her number?"
<Kyu> 07George Lopez?

<drf|laptop> 03and he's like "Go over the plan iwth your boyfriend"
<drf|laptop> 03and she's like "What? He's not my boyfriend" to which that guy goes "Oh, so you'd rather go out with [the other guy]"? and HE walks away too
<drf|laptop> 03and she's like "ugh, are all guys this stupid? I don't want to date either one of you"

<drf|laptop> 03?
<Xanbreon> Dundunduh
<drf|laptop> 03so Xanbreon
<drf|laptop> 03I'm gonna sign up for Technet Professional
<Xanbreon> Oh yes?
<Xanbreon> Did you work out the stuff RE keys?
<drf|laptop> 03Yeah
<drf|laptop> 03they give you 3 of each
<drf|laptop> 03MSDN gives you 10 of each
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<drf|laptop> 03so I figure
<drf|laptop> 03it's not worth it
<drf|laptop> 03@ MSDN
<Chimera> mew
<drf|laptop> 03because like
<drf|laptop> 03MDSN Operating Systems is $800, doesn't include MS Office etc etc
<drf|laptop> 03Technet Professional is $300 with coupon code and you can get 3 of each Windows+Office
<Xanbreon> Aahh
<drf|laptop> 03which is still *tons* cheaper than retail LOL
<drf|laptop> 03I called them
<drf|laptop> 03and asked
<Xanbreon> Why do you want all of that stuff? O-o
<drf|laptop> 03so that I have it LOL
<Xanbreon> I mean, are you actually going to use it?
<drf|laptop> 03since I build computers a lot
<drf|laptop> 03that way I'll have a ton of Win7 keys
<drf|laptop> 03the XP and 7 keys sure
<drf|laptop> 03professional/ultimate at leats
<Xanbreon> Mmhm
<drf|laptop> 03*least
<drf|laptop> 03then I can get the crap ones for lulz
<drf|laptop> 03like Windows 7 Starter
<drf|laptop> 03Yes, that's on there
<Xanbreon> So usefull :P
<drf|laptop> 03XD
<drf|laptop> 03As for professional instead of standard
<drf|laptop> 03standard only gives you 2 keys for each + no enterprise versions
<Xanbreon> Aaahh
<drf|laptop> 03and I just got another bunch of money for my birthday
<drf|laptop> 03so why not XD
<Xanbreon> Dunno what version is the tons of keys one
<drf|laptop> 03MSDN
<drf|laptop> 03MSDn gives you 10 of each
<Xanbreon> Aaah
<drf|laptop> 03but it's craptons more
<drf|laptop> 03I think like $1500?
<drf|laptop> 03if not more
<Xanbreon> Isnt there supposed to be one that give you daily keys?
<drf|laptop> 03the $800 one is *only* operating systems, not Office andw hatnot
<drf|laptop> 03nope
<drf|laptop> 03like
<drf|laptop> 03the daily keys thing
<drf|laptop> 03is stupid
<drf|laptop> 03basically it's 44 keys per day, but still only 3 per product
<drf|laptop> 03so essentially you could claim every single key in a few weeks LOL
<Xanbreon> Oh I see
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03I don't quite get it either
<drf|laptop> 03MSDN works the same way
<drf|laptop> 03probably just to avoid server rape
<drf|laptop> 03since I'm sure Microsoft has a keygen for their own product, and when you hit generate keys it just uses that
<Xanbreon> Its just how MS work
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03imagine if someone got ahold of that keygen Xd
<drf|laptop> 03*XD\
<Xanbreon> Probs if you need more than 44 keys per day
<Xanbreon> You should have a VLK
<Xanbreon> And an activation server
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Xanbreon> People have writen keygens, its getting the keys to also be on MS's servers as valid
<Rukario> hey
<Xanbreon> Thats the harder part
<Rukario> how would you word the answer to this question
<drf|laptop> 03we have a VLK for Office 2010
<Rukario> [9:33:59 PM] Glacymr: what is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter
<drf|laptop> 03at work
<drf|laptop> 03or some sort of enterprise key
<drf|laptop> 03we have the same serial on every computer
<drf|laptop> 03and it activates fine
<Rukario> i know an interpreter is a language where it's implied what to do using language
<drf|laptop> 03like 50 times
<Xanbreon> Compiler compile the code into ASM
<Rukario> like HTML
<Xanbreon> interpreter runs it
<drf|laptop> 03so it's probably an activation server
<Rukario> ok
<Kyu> 07lol
<Xanbreon> Interpreter is like java to the JVM
<Xanbreon> Compiler is like C to machine code
<Xanbreon> drf, office 2010 has the oldstyle VLKs I think
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I'm not sure
<Xanbreon> XP style, where you dont need to run a server
<drf|laptop> 03as I gave Umbreon my Office 2010 key
<drf|laptop> 03and that stopped working
<Kyu> 07"The SF City Hall is one foot taller than the US Capitol building because the west wanted to show off how much better they were than the east coast"
<drf|laptop> 03like after about 3 activations
<Kyu> 07so true
<Kyu> 07|D
<drf|laptop> 03now it's blacklitsed:P
<Kyu> 07</random>
<Xanbreon> youderp
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03it's the joy of phone activation
<drf|laptop> 03I've used the same Win7 key about 20 times
<drf|laptop> 03you just call the automated number and say it's only been used once
<drf|laptop> 03MS's own fault for not fixing that glitch :P
<Rukario> ok
<Rukario> thanks
<drf|laptop> 03but Xanbreon, what do you mean?
<Xanbreon> About what?
<drf|laptop> 03do you mean our key for Office 2010 is just approved for 50+ activations/
<drf|laptop> 03?
<drf|laptop> 03through MS?
<drf|laptop> 03it's literally the exact same key
<drf|laptop> 03I'm not sure why we don;'t use a VLK for 7
<drf|laptop> 03we literally have store-bought OEM discs
<drf|laptop> 03with the stickers
<drf|laptop> 03for each computer
<Xanbreon> Cos you dont want to run a activation server
<drf|laptop> 03why, is that expensive?
<Xanbreon> And you probs dont have enough machines to make it worth while
<Xanbreon> Dunno, never bothered to look into it
<drf|laptop> 03heck, why couldn't someone just hack an activation server
<drf|laptop> 03once it's activated, it stays activated
<Xanbreon> Cos its a pain
<drf|laptop> 03so it's like, connect to hacked server, activate, then remove from server
<Xanbreon> You can just hack the OEM bios activation junk
<Xanbreon> People used todo that
<drf|laptop> 03haven't sen it done for 7
<drf|laptop> 03*seen
<drf|laptop> 03and for XP I have a crack anyway
<Xanbreon> Seen what for 7?
<Xanbreon> Theres tons of BIOS emu junk for 7
<drf|laptop> 03seen people hack the OEM activa4tion
<drf|laptop> 03-4
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Xanbreon> I just use MSDN or MSDNA keys
<drf|laptop> 03I haven't actually seen any computers that came with preactivated 7
<drf|laptop> 03since all of mine are either home-made or came with Vista+upgrade disc
<Xanbreon> Ah
<drf|laptop> 03like my mom's
<drf|laptop> 03had Visyta
<drf|laptop> 03-t
<drf|laptop> 03and we got the upgrade disc through MS
<Xanbreon> Store computers will be
<drf|laptop> 03and I installed it using that key
<drf|laptop> 03it was a store computer
<drf|laptop> 03it had pre-activated Vista
<Xanbreon> If you buy it will 7, it will be pre activated
<drf|laptop> 03but 7 came as an upgrade disc
<drf|laptop> 03that's wha tI mean
<drf|laptop> 03I haven't bought a computer since 7 came out
<drf|laptop> 03or at least a store one
<Rukario> yay last question in my linux review questions
<drf|laptop> 03my dad's... I think he still had to activate it
<Rukario> what is the purpose of a login script?
<Rukario> to execute during login?
<Xanbreon> Its the same junk as vista for the most part
<YoungDamos> Okay today at school, I lost the game. But I made another friend lose the game by writing in the air that I lost it. SHe got mad and knew what I was saying. LOL
<Xanbreon> login script set stuff up on login
<Rukario> that's what i implied
<Xanbreon> %path's anything really
<junh1024-XD> a logon script that logs off ( ¬‿¬)
<Xanbreon> You could do that
<Xanbreon> But it would be kinda pointless
<drf|laptop> 03Xanbreon I got a few Android questions for you
<Xanbreon> Sure
<drf|laptop> 03the new phone I got has some sort of internal-mounted memory that shows up as /sdcard
<drf|laptop> 03and then I put in an actual MicroSD
<drf|laptop> 03so now there are two
<drf|laptop> 03problem is
<drf|laptop> 03my real one shows up as /sdcard-ext
<drf|laptop> 03and all the backup programs use /sdcard
<drf|laptop> 03some don't let me change it
<drf|laptop> 03is there a way to switch the two, or make the internal something like /sdcard-int ?
<Xanbreon> Nope
<drf|laptop> 03darn it
<drf|laptop> 03you can't even swap them?
<Xanbreon> Hurrhm
<Xanbreon> You might be able to screw with the mount points
<drf|laptop> 03also yay, the Google Play site acutally works now
<drf|laptop> 03like
<drf|laptop> 03if I click on my apps
<drf|laptop> 03it actually shows every app (free and paid) that I've ever installed
<drf|laptop> 03it's much easier to just click-click-download than trying to use the phone XD
<Xanbreon> is /sdcard-ext under /sdcard or are they both under the root dir?
<drf|laptop> 03root
<drf|laptop> 03they literally show up as two defices
<drf|laptop> 03*devices
<Xanbreon> Hurrhm
<Xanbreon> Maybe, you would have to check XDA tbh
<Xanbreon> If its doable, its probs been done
<drf|laptop> 03*devices
<Xanbreon> I know you cant do it on the SGS2, but eh
<drf|laptop> 03er
<drf|laptop> 03*OK
<drf|laptop> 03so SGS2 has that same crap with two SD cards?
<drf|laptop> 03I wish you could just disable the internal mount point if you have a real MicroSD
<drf|laptop> 03I don't even fricking want to use it, since that requires me to use the USB cable instead of just pulling the cable uout
<drf|laptop> 03er *card
<Xanbreon> heh
<Xanbreon> Wouldnt make much sence for lots of phones that now have 16gig or something of built in storage
<drf|laptop> 03this one's 8
<drf|laptop> 03but I have a 32GB MicroSD
<drf|laptop> 03which is more pro :P
<drf|laptop> 03there are some rumors that it can actually use the 64GB Micro SDXC cards
<Xanbreon> Internal storage is normally FAR faster
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<Xanbreon> Lots of phones can
<drf|laptop> 03I could look into that for nandroid backups then
<drf|laptop> 03since those take forever
<Xanbreon> They do
<drf|laptop> 03I had some questions about that too but that's specific to my phone so you prolly wouldn't know
<Xanbreon> What kinda stuff?
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03right now I have this crap installed using SafeStrap
<drf|laptop> 03the problem is that I can't apparently boot into the recovery menu automatically
<drf|laptop> 03I have to manually press the menu key after booting
<Xanbreon> Yeh, thats phone spesific stuff, dunno about that
<drf|laptop> 03which means no scheduling
<drf|laptop> 03:/
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<drf|laptop> 03stupid locked bootloaders
<Xanbreon> This is why I avoided them at all costs
<drf|laptop> 03I had no choice
<drf|laptop> 03I needed a 4G phone with a keyboard
<Xanbreon> You didnt need, you wanted
<Xanbreon> :P
<junh1024-XD> ^
<drf|laptop> 03same thing
<drf|laptop> 03anyway wtf else was I going to ask
<junh1024-XD> NOT same thing
<Xanbreon> Not really :P
<Xanbreon> You need air, food, water
<Xanbreon> You want, stuff
<Xanbreon> blah blah blah
<junh1024-XD> </PATF>
<drf|laptop> 03oh, do you know anything about custom lockscreens?
<drf|laptop> 03I already replaced the launcher with ADW Launcher which is what CyanogenMod uses
<drf|laptop> 03but the lockscreen is pretty reta9rded, the swipe to unlock thing is like in the MIDDLE of it, height-wise
<Xanbreon> Pretty sure theres lockscreens you can use on the market
<Xanbreon> eg widgetlocker
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03and they can replace the stock one?
<Xanbreon> You turn off the stock one, and just use the other one
<drf|laptop> 03the ones I found via google looked really stupid
<drf|laptop> 03like all they did was add widgets to the stock one
<drf|laptop> 03how do you "turn off" the stock one
<Xanbreon> Actually, dunno how they work
<drf|laptop> 03I'm not even sure how the launcher works, I installed AdwLauncher and it literally just replaced the stock one on its own o_O
<drf|laptop> 03and no root required?
<Xanbreon> Never tried one
<Xanbreon> Shouldnt need root
<drf|laptop> 03my friend used one called Launcher Pro
<Xanbreon> I use ADW EX
<drf|laptop> 03why wouldn't you need root to replace the launcher?
<Xanbreon> Huh
<Xanbreon> The launcher is just another app
<Xanbreon> You dont need root to use a diff one
<drf|laptop> 03you need root to take a screenshot but not to replace the launcher/
<drf|laptop> 03?
<Xanbreon> Launcher is just another app..
<drf|laptop> 03so it doesn't actually replace it?
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03how does it tell the stock launcher to gtfo then?
<Xanbreon> The screen shot thing is due to androids sec model
<Xanbreon> You can set defaults for stuff
<drf|laptop> 03I can't find any settings for that
<drf|laptop> 03@ launchers
<drf|laptop> 03oh but speaking of settings
<drf|laptop> 03another question I had
<drf|laptop> 03for some stupid reason, all my text is being underlined
<drf|laptop> 03when I type
<Xanbreon> Install 2 launchers
<Xanbreon> Hit the home button
<drf|laptop> 03either using the on screen keyboard or the real one
<Xanbreon> See what it says
<drf|laptop> 03it just used Adw
<drf|laptop> 03on its own
<Xanbreon> Sleep well Espeon<3
<drf|laptop> 03didn't ask me
<Xanbreon> Yes..
<Xanbreon> Then the stock launcher didnt take the default
<drf|laptop> 03I don't even know how I'd switch back, other than removing Adw
<drf|laptop> 03Not that i want to
<drf|laptop> 03anyway
<drf|laptop> 03any idea @ the underlined text?
<drf|laptop> 03I swear I fixed that problem before but forget how
<Umbreon> back
<drf|laptop> 03it li[terally underlines every word I type, even with autocorrect turned off
<Xanbreon> settings > applications > downloaded > click an app > scroll down to launch by defaul
<Xanbreon> You can manage stuff there
<drf|laptop> 03yeah I know
<Xanbreon> No clue RE underlining, thats a moto thing not general android
<drf|laptop> 03you sure?
<drf|laptop> 03I'm pretty sure I saw some posts on xda from other manufacturers
<Xanbreon> Oh, like, the world you are typing is underlined?
<Xanbreon> Or all text?
<drf|laptop> 03the word
<drf|laptop> 03also
<drf|laptop> 03AdwLauncher has no defaults set :P
<drf|laptop> 03but yet it replaces the stock one
<drf|laptop> 03hence, Magic :P
<Xanbreon> Then to stock isnt asking for the default
<drf|laptop> 03I just don't know how it can do that without root
<drf|laptop> 03yeah but I mean, the stock one isn't even an app
<drf|laptop> 03it's just there
<Xanbreon> The launcher is just another app
<Xanbreon> It is just an app
<Xanbreon> Just built into the rom
<Xanbreon> :P
<drf|laptop> 03well it's hidden from the "manage apps" then
<Xanbreon> Of cause, but if you looked in /system/app
<Xanbreon> IT will be there
<drf|laptop> 03ahy
<drf|laptop> 03-y
<drf|laptop> 03so like
<Xanbreon> I have ADW EX built into the rom I am using, I just winrar'ed it in there
<drf|laptop> 03what's all this fuss over freezing system apps? I just delete the apk file LOl
<drf|laptop> 03from /system.app
<drf|laptop> 03*/
<Xanbreon> Freezing allows you to test before you make the change perma
<Xanbreon> Also less of a pain if you want to get something back
<drf|laptop> 03yeah but the whole "freeze/restore"
<drf|laptop> 03supposedlyh it doesn't "delete" them
<drf|laptop> 03just prevents them from working
<drf|laptop> 03or something
<Xanbreon> It doesnt
<Xanbreon> Theres an XML file, with an option you can toogle, and android will stop an app from running
<Xanbreon> Pretty sure its what the new ICS disablerling thing is based on
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03I'm curious
<drf|laptop> 03how is ADW EX different than the free one?
<drf|laptop> 03is it the same launcher but with more customization options?
<Xanbreon> Its a lot "smoother" and more customisation options
<drf|laptop> 03smoother?
<Xanbreon> Mhhm
<Xanbreon> I had them side by side, and with my setup EX was a lot faster, and didnt jitter at all
<drf|laptop> 03it was laggy on my older phones but that's due to crappy specs
<drf|laptop> 03it works really well on the new one
<drf|laptop> 03so you think it's worth the $4 or whatever it is?
<Xanbreon> I had them side by side, EX was a lot better
<Xanbreon> Meh, I can give you the apk if you wanna try it
<drf|laptop> 03I'm sure I could find it X
<drf|laptop> 03*XD
<drf|laptop> 03ugh god dang though
<drf|laptop> 03Yahoo Mail apparently uses notifications
<drf|laptop> 03and I can't turn them off in the app
<Xanbreon> Its like ADW but better, so if you like ADW you should like EX more
<Xanbreon> unno
<drf|laptop> 03can I tell Android to just silence the app from sending notifications/
<drf|laptop> 03I swear I never had that problem before
<drf|laptop> 03and there *was8 an option
<Xanbreon> "EWH YAHOO"
<drf|laptop> 03but apparently they removed it, dirty programmers
<drf|laptop> 03that's true, but I use their mail
<drf|laptop> 03I've had it since 2001
<drf|laptop> 03and see no reason to stop XD
<Xanbreon> Heh
<drf|laptop> 03it works fine for my needs
<drf|laptop> 03and I prefer web-based email to pop3/imap
<Xanbreon> I had a hotmail email, but I moved to gmail pretty much as soon as it was out
<drf|laptop> 03since I read my emails from everywhere and I hate that whole "webmail" client
<drf|laptop> 03ah there
<drf|laptop> 03I can turn off notifications in the app
<drf|laptop> 03I just had to try the other thing XD
<Xanbreon> You cant diables notification on a OS lvl
<drf|laptop> 03OK
<drf|laptop> 03hmm
<drf|laptop> 03are widgets just apk files too?
<Xanbreon> Everythings an apk
<Xanbreon> Apart from the framework
<drf|laptop> 03res-framework.apk ;p
<Xanbreon> widgets may be built into the app though
<drf|laptop> 03into which app?
<drf|laptop> 03the framework?
<Xanbreon> Thats err, more UI stuff, theres also framework.jar
<Xanbreon> eg, yahoo mail widget will be built into the yahoo mail apk
<drf|laptop> 03ah
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03there's a widget that I've always had
<drf|laptop> 03called Power Control
<drf|laptop> 03for some stupid reason
<drf|laptop> 03the Droid 4 lacks it
<Xanbreon> Aahh
<drf|laptop> 03could I just port the apk over from the other phone?
<drf|laptop> 03like, can you *install* it or is that a system thing
<drf|laptop> 03since it always just came with the phone
<Xanbreon> You would probs have to push it
<drf|laptop> 03it wasn't a Moto-specific thing either, cyanogenmod has it too
<Xanbreon> But.. it might not work with your framework
<drf|laptop> 03motoblur? :P
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<Xanbreon> Its kind of a complext intertwining of stock framework, and OEM frameworks
<drf|laptop> 03are the options that show up under Settings built into the framework and/or settings apk?
<Xanbreon> depends what the apk was compiled against
<Xanbreon> settings is just an apk
<Xanbreon> But its compiled against the framework
<Xanbreon> So they kind of have to match up
<Xanbreon> Otherwise nothing works
<Xanbreon> Frameworks provide assests that apps use
<Xanbreon> And each framework will be diff
<Xanbreon> depending on how much the OEM screwed around in them
<drf|laptop> 03hm
<drf|laptop> 03well is there a way to remove one of the menus in settings?
<drf|laptop> 03I'm assuming not :/
<Xanbreon> Yes
<Xanbreon> But you would need to decompile
<Xanbreon> And frack around in the XML
<Xanbreon> and stuff
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03meh, too lazy
<drf|laptop> 03basically
<drf|laptop> 03Verizon has this crap called Backup Assistant
<drf|laptop> 03it was nice back on dumbphones
<drf|laptop> 03it basically syncs all your contacts to their servers
<drf|laptop> 03but all my contacts are on gmail so >_>
<Xanbreon> Dude, XDA
<drf|laptop> 03but yet, they insist on shoving that crap on their Android phones
<drf|laptop> 03I can delete the APK
<Xanbreon> Its probs been removed
<drf|laptop> 03but it's also an entire submenu in the settings
<Xanbreon> from the settings menu as well
<drf|laptop> 03so that just breaks it
<drf|laptop> 03if you click on it, it crashes the phone
<drf|laptop> 03LOl
<Xanbreon> Genrally, if its a good phone, and its been around for a bit, almost all the mods you want will be on that side
<Xanbreon> -side+forum
<drf|laptop> 03except cyanogenmod :/
<drf|laptop> 03they're apparently working on CM9 for it but it's buggy as frick, as all CM9s are
<drf|laptop> 03hence why I hate ICS
<Xanbreon> Hmm
<Xanbreon> Blame the OEMs for not giving us src
<Xanbreon> I need to go check on the status of ICS kernels/roms soon
<Xanbreon> Havent been keeping up with dev for the past few days
<drf|laptop> 03My phone supposedly will get ICS
<drf|laptop> 03(stock)
<drf|laptop> 03just in the near future
<drf|laptop> 03but honestly I'm fine with 2.3
<Xanbreon> We have ICS stock roms
<Xanbreon> They have been touchjizzed allover
<drf|laptop> 03not for the Droid 4 though
<drf|laptop> 03at least I don't think so
<Xanbreon> And still are kinda buggy
<Xanbreon> Nah
<Xanbreon> When I say we, I mean sgs2
<Xanbreon> :/
<drf|laptop> 03oh'
<drf|laptop> 03yeah I don't have a Samsung :
<drf|laptop> 03*:P
<drf|laptop> 03and no I'm not a motorola fanboy
<drf|laptop> 03I was considering the Samsung Stratosphere
<drf|laptop> 03but that thing has crap specs for its time x.x
<Xanbreon> If there was a SGS2 with a KB i would have said go for it
<Xanbreon> But meh, thats basically just a SGS1 with a KB
<Xanbreon> :/
<drf|laptop> 03exactly
<drf|laptop> 03Droid 4 is a lot more hardcore hardware wise
<drf|laptop> 03it might not be cutting edge but it's still really good by today's standards
<Xanbreon> Yeh, its fine
<Xanbreon> SoC is falling behind, but its still find
<Xanbreon> *fine
<drf|laptop> 03I got it rooted, I got recovery (sorta), honestly the only thing I'd want at this point is CyanogenMod
<drf|laptop> 03SoC?
<HyperMetalLugia> INB4 Galaxy S3
<HyperMetalLugia> System ona chip
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<drf|laptop> 03oh
<drf|laptop> 03CAN WE GET NES ON A CHIP IN MY PHONE
<Xanbreon> You should be able to run a nes emulator np
<Xanbreon> Why would you want to add a chip todo it?
<drf|laptop> 03I was kidding
<Xanbreon> Meh.. if they are going quad A9 for the sgs3 I really think about it tbh
<drf|laptop> 03hm.
<drf|laptop> 03OK so
<drf|laptop> 03you know the uh
<drf|laptop> 03battery percentages
<drf|laptop> 03like what it reports to widgets etc
<drf|laptop> 03is that built into framework
<drf|laptop> 03?
<Xanbreon> Errrh
<drf|laptop> 03for some incredibly stupid reason, the Droid 4 has 10% increments, despite the Droid 2 (hardware, at least) supporting 1% increments >_>
<drf|laptop> 03it's like going backwards LOL
<Xanbreon> Widgets should still show 1%'s even if the UI only shows 10%'s
<drf|laptop> 03nope.
<drf|laptop> 03Battery Widget shows them in 10s
<drf|laptop> 03maybe it's a crap widget? Got a better one? :P
<drf|laptop> 03Though Battery Widget will show 1% under CyanogenMod on my Droid 2
<drf|laptop> 03whereas it did 10% on stock since the stock UI did 10
<Xanbreon> Not that you can actually be acrurate enough to make 1% stuff be correct
<drf|laptop> 03yeah but it's more accurateg than 10%
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<Xanbreon> Depends
<Xanbreon> Sometimes the % will go up under high load
<Xanbreon> Err
<Xanbreon> after high load
<Xanbreon> due to overestimated etc
<Xanbreon> as for the % stuff, if even 3rd party stuff is only showing 10%, might need to be edited in framework
<drf|laptop> 03that's wha tI thought
<drf|laptop> 03but well
<drf|laptop> 03I think battery widget just grabs the info from "battery info"
<drf|laptop> 03are there ones that do something else?
<Xanbreon> Depends on the phone and stuff
<Xanbreon> eg the fuel guage chip in the sgs2 doesnt give you current draw
<Xanbreon> Varies from phone to phone
<Xanbreon> as its a hardware thing
<drf|laptop> 03supposedly the Droid 2 took some tweaking for them to get 1% increments
<drf|laptop> 03but they DID, so it's obviously built into the hardware to do 1%?
<drf|laptop> 03since AFAIK you can't mess with hardware in custom ROMs
<Xanbreon> You cant measure it well enough todo 1%'s well
<Xanbreon> as sometimes the charge will go upwards
<Xanbreon> This is why OEMS do 10%s or no %
<Xanbreon> So they dont get support calls from stupid people
<drf|laptop> 03I swear I've seen OEMs with 1%
<Xanbreon> Im rly tired
<Xanbreon> Thus poor wording
<Xanbreon> hard to form nice seninces
<Xanbreon> or spell
<Xanbreon> frack sake
<drf|laptop> 03you drunk too? :P
<Xanbreon> No
<drf|laptop> 03surprising
<Xanbreon> Piss off
<HyperMetalLugia> I know right
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Xanbreon> Tossers
<drf|laptop> 03so is general crap such as the "eco-friendly warnings", like "Your phone is fully charged, unplug it to save power!" is built into the framework?
<Xanbreon> Somewhere in the framework yeh
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLFail
<drf|laptop> 03yeah, Motorola is trying to be "green" now >:_>
<drf|laptop> 03*>_>
<drf|laptop> 03what really bugs me too
<drf|laptop> 03and this I think is universal for all Androids
<drf|laptop> 03is that it goes "You can't upload large YouTube videos over 3G, go connect to wifi"
<drf|laptop> 03and I swear there's a hack to fix that
*YoungDamos huggles the Charizard
<drf|laptop> 03I have unlimited data, so come at me bro
<HyperMetalLugia> what about
<Xanbreon> Uploading large stuff will crush the battery though
<HyperMetalLugia> hotspot uploading
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<drf|laptop> 03that's what I did Xd
<drf|laptop> 03I'd use EasyTether
<drf|laptop> 03and just use the computer
<drf|laptop> 03to upload
<drf|laptop> 03and Xanbreon I know, but sometimes I just gotta do it

<drf|laptop> 03not that it really matters, I just saw that picture and was like LOL

<Aurora> 6you did a really suckish job

<Sato> hmm
<Aurora> 6"you're wasting your own time by ditching class" and then "I don't need anyone's trust"

<Aurora> 6you can do what you want
<Sato> I had alot on my plate that day
<Aurora> 6and what about the other days
<Aurora> 6all of them.
<Aurora> 6believe me, I am not an aggressive person
<Sato> I'm trying to reach out
<Aurora> 6the fact you see me aggressive should be a sign in itself
<Aurora> 6I'll say this
<Aurora> 6just leave me alone, entirely
<Aurora> 6I don't like setting ignores, it's a hassle
<Aurora> 6if i talk to you, it'll be on my own accord
<Sato> Aurora: I'm trying
<Aurora> 6I've been given no reason to trust you is my point, sato
<Sato> I hate having enemies
<junh1024-XD> dude frick
<Aurora> 6you've said that a number of times, and I've come close to quitting this irc 4 times because of it
<Aurora> 6just leave it at that
<junh1024-XD> stop apologizing for aplogizing for aplogizing for aplogizing etc
<Aurora> 6work on it, we'll see what comes of it
<Aurora> 6jun your sentence made my head hurt
<Sato> it's a two sided process
<Sato> Aurora:
<junh1024-XD> just talk (r)
<SilverSonic> ....have i been missing something...
<Sato> trying to trademark that ?
<SilverSonic> actually you know what.

<Sato> I'm ready to move on I suppose
<Aurora> 6god
<Aurora> 6*good
<Sato> no point in rekindling a friendship the other person doesn't want
<junh1024-XD> inb4 mother of god
<Aurora> 6sato, that's my point >.>
<Sato> I don't have to be friends with everyone on here
<Aurora> 6I like friendship, you give me no reason to be friends with you, and then you blame me for not wanting to be friends
<Aurora> 6and since i don't care, I'll say that, and tell you not to nick alert me to give me special attention
<Sato> I will be happy to have any friends
<Aurora> 6mainly because i'm too lazy to set ignore every time i come on here
<Aurora> 6there, done
<Aurora> 6and I'm on memebase
<Aurora> 6wonderful
<Aurora> 6now i might not be sleeping for an hour
<Sato> so has anyone tried Kid Icarus yet the new 3DS one

<Sato> Windows 8 hates IRC
<junh1024-XD> she doesnt Win8
<Sato> my laptop will remain Windows 8 CP and my desktop will be Windows 7 Professional
<junh1024-XD> oh
<Sato> drf is throwing that in at no cost
<Sato> I want to throw an SSD into that desktop
<Aurora> 6fuuu
<Ascendant|Away> for hell's sake
<Aurora> 6my bed isn't even made, I need to do that so I can sleep
<Sato> $330 for 1 TB solid state jun
<Aurora> 6woah, its Ascendant
<Sato> that's killer
<Aurora> 6who I admittedly havent seen in
<Aurora> 6a while.
<Sato> hey Ascendant
<Sato> my return has gone ok so far
<Sato> thanks for convincing me to give this place a second chance
<Ascendant|Away> Uh no problems
<Ascendant|Away> And uh, I'm still technically away
<Ascendant|Away> and heya Aurora
<Ascendant|Away> heya to both of your really
<Aurora> 6"technically"
<Aurora> 6is such a loose term lol
<Ascendant|Away> well
<Ascendant|Away> I'm still not at home
<Ascendant|Away> and won't be until tomorrow
<Aurora> 6oh
<Aurora> 6wait where have you been
<Sato> well might as well put Aurora on ignore to stop my temptation to talk with her
<junh1024-XD> ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)ｱﾊﾊ八八ﾉヽﾉヽﾉヽﾉ ＼ / ＼/ ＼
<Sato> there we go
<junh1024-XD> SSDs break
<junh1024-XD> really often
<Aurora> 6jun faces lol
<Sato> really?
<junh1024-XD> more so than mechanical ones, apparently, sometimes
<Sato> I've heard they're better because they're well solid
<Ascendant|Away> on camp Aurora
<Aurora> 6..
<junh1024-XD> well, they might be better for laptops cuz
<Ascendant|Away> I kinda cbf'd to post on the forums

<Aurora> 6I'm sorry, I've had a long day, I'm losing my brain

<junh1024-XD> \o
<Sato> but you're the only one who'll talk to me, damn
<Aurora> 6i think
<Aurora> 6i need to get off the comp
<Sato> Ascendant|Away: did she leave because of me?
<Sato> I sure hope not
<Ascendant|Away> don't think so
<Ascendant|Away> "it can sense if it's being hacked - if the hacking software is getting close to the password it will automatically burn the chip."
<Ascendant|Away> that's kinda counter-productive
<Sato> and expensive?
<Sato> is it covered in the warranty I wonder
<Sato> if not this would clearly just be for business
<Umbreon> satol alert
<Sato> if something isn't funded on day 1 of being on kickstarter is that a bad sign?
<Sato> like funded at all
<Umbreon> shrug
<Sato> hmm
<Sato> atleast there's no risk
<Sato> I won't owe anything if the funding fails
<Sato> but it will mean no one is interested in a Super Mario orchestration project
<Sato> as is I don't have the tools or team I need
<Sato> so I thought I would try and see if someone would kickstart my project
<Sato> wow it's so quiet
<Sato> hey SilverSonic if you're still here I've a bit of an odd music request for tomorrow's show, Bramble Blast DKL2

<Rukario> lol HyperMetalLugia
<Rukario> installing virtualbox on windows 8
<Rukario> can't believe it's working
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
<HyperMetalLugia> it worked for me.
<Rukario> i might actually have to test this out
<Rukario> i'm thinking since linux doesn't like my wireless card that i would just run windows 8
<Rukario> and VM into linux
<MysticLugia> 02you couldrun windows over an USB-device or another hard drive x3
<Rukario> o-O why would i want to do that :P
<MysticLugia> 02because I run mac-os via USB x3
<Rukario> i want to be able to run linux on my laptop
<MysticLugia> 02just as random fact x3
<Rukario> but the wireless card doesn't want to work with it so i want to use windows 8 to just run a VM of it
<MysticLugia> 02well, use Linux as main source or install it on another harddrive
<Rukario> the reason i want to use windows 8 is because the sucker can boot up really fast
<MysticLugia> 02hmm, so you want to use windows 8 only as start up?
<Rukario> yes
<Rukario> i'm testing right now if windows 8 can actually run a hypervisor though
<MysticLugia> 02you still have to run Linux up then
<MysticLugia> 02oh
<Rukario> i got it to install virtualbox with no trouble
<Rukario> but well :/
<Rukario> i can't seem to make it create a VM
<Rukario> yay it's working now
<Rukario> i didn't tell virtualbox to capture the CD drive
<Rukario> now i can get dizzy
<Rukario> since i'm running a VM of linux mint, inside a VM of windows 8
<MysticLugia> 02x3
<MysticLugia> 02try to have 4 windoses at once, actually 4 different windows desktops
<Rukario> o-O lol
<Rukario> yay found the windows 8 startup directory
*Ray yaaaawns
*Ray finally home
<Ray> 02=w=
<MysticLugia> 02owo
<SilverSonic> RAAAAAAAAAAAY
<SilverSonic> TUUUUUUUNE IN SHORTLY
<SilverSonic> OR NAO
<SilverSonic> :B
<SheenaFox> or never
<MysticLugia> 02olol x3
<Rukario> making a disk of windows 8
<SilverSonic> Sheena you tune in too jk :P
<SilverSonic> you wouldnt like my voice anyway~
<SilverSonic> its craaaaaaaaap~
<SilverSonic> |D
<Lighty> 06we all know that SIlver
<Lighty> 06but ecver heard my voice like

<Lighty> 06or after a whole DJ party? xD
<MysticLugia> 02oh damn x3
<Lighty> 06not healty either
<Lighty> 06xD
<Rukario> MysticLugia
<Rukario> have you seen the videos?
<MysticLugia> 02hmm, which ones?
<Rukario> people have gotten windows 8 to boot up within 8 seconds
<HyperMetalLugia> Win
<MysticLugia> 02hmm, I should look about this

<MysticLugia> 02DAM!
<Rukario> that's why i want to make it run the hypervisor XD
<MysticLugia> 02and I can understand why *-*
<SilverSonic|Live> http://radionintendo.com/listen.m3u
<Rukario> i wonder what they do to make it boot up so fast
<Rukario> i know one thing they probably did was disable prefetch
<Rukario> annoying little feature
<MysticLugia> 02hmm yeah
<Rukario> first time installing windows 8
<Rukario> as an actual OS instead of VM
*Syrune 14»»3 WinAmp Pro 5.58 14«»4 Artist (Yamashita Kousuke) 14«»12 Album (Dragonaut -THE RESONANCE- Original Soundtrack - CD1 (2008)) 14«» 7Track (Houkouu Kimochi) 14«» 10Details (00:03/01:22 (4.9%) | 320Kbps | 3.14MB | mp3 | 44KHz) 14»»
<MysticLugia> 02oh good luck!
<Rukario> i don't need luck XD
<HyperMetalLugia> Win8 is iffy
<Rukario> it is iffy
<HyperMetalLugia> Remove metro, add start menu
<HyperMetalLugia> then it'll be fine
<Rukario> well
<Rukario> only reason i'm making it an OS
<Rukario> is to be a hypervisor
<Rukario> XD
<Rukario> it's the fastest bootup OS i know right now
<Rukario> that i have access to
<Rukario> i hope when i told it to install in the 60GB unallocated space
<Rukario> that it takes all 60GB
<MysticLugia> 02so 8 is the fastest non beta start-up OS ?
<HyperMetalLugia> well
<HyperMetalLugia> Still beta.
<HyperMetalLugia> So we'll see in August/RTM or october
<MysticLugia> 02i tought so |3
<Rukario> i wonder if they'll say you can't use the consumer preview anymore when the actual OS comes out
<HyperMetalLugia> see
<HyperMetalLugia> I *THINK*
<HyperMetalLugia> the beta is 1 year
<HyperMetalLugia> so in 2013 the beta is dead
<Rukario> o-o
<HyperMetalLugia> give them time to buy the actual OS before it dies :p
<Rukario> what do you mean dies?
<Rukario> they don't support it anymore?
<HyperMetalLugia> you know.
<HyperMetalLugia> Unactivates itself
<HyperMetalLugia> and so
<Rukario> hmm
<Rukario> so it's logic bombed lol
<HyperMetalLugia> http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Xpnv7BHn5K8/T1qEQBWxxnI/AAAAAAAAD5s/_17A7i1uK_I/s1600/windows+8+winver+command+2.png
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Rukario> i see
<HyperMetalLugia> around that time
<Rukario> we aren't going to live that long anyway so :P
<HyperMetalLugia> haha
<MysticLugia> 02x3
<HyperMetalLugia> Soo
<HyperMetalLugia> We can't say Windows boots too slowly
<Rukario> lol
<HyperMetalLugia> we can't say Windows has too many viruses (Secureboot and better protection this time around)
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> well, it is *too* easy to infect windows
<Rukario> i'll think of something
<Rukario> i'll probably have to take vista out for windows 7
<Rukario> i think 7 boots faster than vista
<Rukario> :P
<MysticLugia> 02good luck I have windows 7 on this, tough i still hate those bugs, like that damn crashing of folders and explorers
<HyperMetalLugia> The only times folders crashed was when
<HyperMetalLugia> I used a floppy disk
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Rukario> well i did everything i know how to speed up a system in vista
<Rukario> disabled prefetch, adjusted it for best performance

<Rukario> turned off system protection
<HyperMetalLugia> Rukario
<HyperMetalLugia> How do I disabple prefetch
<HyperMetalLugia> I haz a vistaPC
<HyperMetalLugia> :V
<Rukario> the same way you do 7
<HyperMetalLugia> how.
<HyperMetalLugia> ;V
<Rukario> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms940847(v=winembedded.5).aspx
<HyperMetalLugia> I never bothered with the prefix
<HyperMetalLugia> e
<HyperMetalLugia> r
<Rukario> that should be all you need to know
<HyperMetalLugia> What does prefetch do anyway?
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Rukario> basically during bootup
<Rukario> windows will load up part of your commonly used applications into memory
<Rukario> that is what prefetch does
<NightSeas> 12!Pokemon
<ScriptBot> NightSeas, you are a 12Prinplup.
<Rukario> basically the point is to allow applications to boot up faster inside windows
<Rukario> however, it slows down the boot time for windows
<HyperMetalLugia> Well
<HyperMetalLugia> I don't need to worry about that with Vista as... it is on 24/7
<HyperMetalLugia> Had 2 weeks uptime
<Rukario> i see
<HyperMetalLugia> WB DRF
<drfsupercenter> 03thanks x.x
<Rukario> hi drf
<MysticLugia> 02wb DRF
<Rukario> i think this might work
<Rukario> running a VM of linux inside windows
<HyperMetalLugia> ..Slowpoke?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Rukario> although i wish i knew how to disable file sharing
<Rukario> on vista
<Rukario> with comodo firewall
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLWhat
<HyperMetalLugia> Just go to network and stuff
<HyperMetalLugia> disable it for private?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Rukario> both options are grayed out
<Rukario> and it says that to toggle this option, it has to be done in my firewall
<Rukario> and network discovery is set to custom
<Rukario> instead of on or off
<Rukario> the main reason i use linux away from home HyperMetalLugia is everytime i am on someone else's network
<Rukario> i always get notifications that there is other computers on the network
<Rukario> and if i would like to file share with them blahblah
<Rukario> linux doesn't care about other computesr XD
<HyperMetalLugia> huh?
<HyperMetalLugia> I never ge tthat in 7
<HyperMetalLugia> I just set it to public and boom
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Rukario> i get it in 7 as well
<Rukario> even when set to public
<drfsupercenter> 03yay, the money is actually in my account now
<HyperMetalLugia> o-o
<drfsupercenter> 03so I can buy that TechNet subscription
<drfsupercenter> 03XD
<Rukario> o-o
<drfsupercenter> 03frick
<drfsupercenter> 03MS Word 2000 is freezing again
<drfsupercenter> 03I hate when that happens
<drfsupercenter> 03it's some update for the 2007/2010 office suites that breaks 2000
<drfsupercenter> 03I think it's "Office Live Add-In"
<HyperMetalLugia> weird
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what
<drfsupercenter> 03**Please note: If you are using Internet Explorer 8 or older, you need to upgrade to IE9**
<drfsupercenter> 03Way to just shaft XP users :P
<drfsupercenter> 03granted I'm using Firefox but still
<MysticLugia> 02herro Samurott

<MysticLugia> 02WAZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPP
<Samurott> 07Yays, it works
<MysticLugia> 02hm? x3
<HyperMetalLugia> seriusly Vista?
<HyperMetalLugia> IE9 with 1 tab on facebook/game is taking up half a gig of RAM.
<HyperMetalLugia> Yay memory leaks?
<HyperMetalLugia> :P
<Samurott> 07Ohai ML
*Samurott was distracted by stuffz
<drfsupercenter> 03blame Flash, HML
<drfsupercenter> 03since Facebook games are usually Flash
<drfsupercenter> 03:P
<drfsupercenter> 03Apple products don't support them because they're too crappy to run it
*drfsupercenter hides
<Rukario> rawr
*MysticLugia hides as well
<Samurott> 07drf, did you hear about the problem with the new iPad?
<Samurott> 07and no, not the whole thing
<Skylands> 10It heats up
<Samurott> 07Apparen
<Samurott> 07Yes that
<Rukario> !attack HyperMetalLugia
<ScriptBot> Jigglypuff uses Iron Head on HyperMetalLugia! It's not very effective... HyperMetalLugia still has 145 HP left!
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I heard about that
<Samurott> 07It gets 16 degrees hotter than the iPad 2 due to (I guess) the new display and the graphics processor
<drfsupercenter> 03my Droid 4 gets pretty hot too, granted I was downloading about 57 apps at once
<Ray> 02<HyperMetalLugia> IE9 with 1 tab on facebook/game is taking up half a gig of RAM. <- Pic or didn't happen
<Samurott> 07This is why I don't get technology as soon as it comes out
<drfsupercenter> 03inb4 HML now prefers IE10 over 9
<drfsupercenter> 03the Droid 4 is kinda odd
<drfsupercenter> 03in that it has this "webtop" thing
<drfsupercenter> 03that's an entirely separate OS
<drfsupercenter> 03and you can't get rid of it
<drfsupercenter> 03it makes it so if you buy a Motorola-capable netbook you can pop the phone in the dock and use it as a modem or something
<Samurott> 07drf, I'm considering getting a new laptop that's not MacBook, do you have any recommendations?
<drfsupercenter> 03MSI
<drfsupercenter> 03they're like $1600 and have i7s, 16GB of RAM, Blu-Ray burners
<drfsupercenter> 03basically the highest end you can get right now :P
*Ray ragequits
<drfsupercenter> 03Ray, YOUR FAULT FOR USING NICK ALERTS
<Samurott> 07I'm thinking I'd like something that works for games, decent internet browsing, and good battery
<Ray> 02BUY ME A MONITOR
<Ray> 02AND THEN I CAN DISABLE IT
<drfsupercenter> 03I don't use nick alerts on my laptop and that only has one screen, u mad?
<NightSeas> 12Blu-Ray :D
<drfsupercenter> 03Samurott so in other words you don't want high end? LOL
<Ray> 02because you don't do stuff?
<drfsupercenter> 03My logic, usually, is to just get the best system you can get, even if you don't plan on using all of it
<drfsupercenter> 03opposed to just "settling" for less
<Samurott> 07If it's less than a decent MacBook, then that's good
<drfsupercenter> 03I can understand if money is an issue
<Samurott> 07I would like mid-high range
<drfsupercenter> 03but if you were thinking of buyina Macbook
<drfsupercenter> 03those are like $1600+ anyway
<drfsupercenter> 03so yeah
<Ray> 02with 1600$
<Ray> 02all the stuff that I'd do..
<Ray> 02:'D
<Samurott> 07It makes me lol that they have a MacBook that's on sale at the NEX, $100 and it's still nearly $2100
<drfsupercenter> 03exactly
<Samurott> 07*$100 off
<drfsupercenter> 03the *cheapest* Macbook is like $1000, right? And that one's relatively crap
<drfsupercenter> 03I wont'deny that the higher end Macbook Pros are good systems, but they're still way more expensive than they need to be :P
<drfsupercenter> 03and in fact
<drfsupercenter> 03I installed Mac OSX on my MSI laptop
<Samurott> 07I talked with Lighty and he said that ASUS is good
<drfsupercenter> 03it works fine, minus the Wi-Fi
<drfsupercenter> 03Asus is good, yeah, but their high-end stuff can be even more expensive than APple LOL
<Samurott> 07Wow
<drfsupercenter> 03I've seen $2000 Asuses
<drfsupercenter> 03MSI's highest end is like $1800 or so :P
<Rukario> :P
<Samurott> 07hmm
<Rukario> i have an asus
<Syrune> ASUS, pretty good, but yeah stupidly expensive.
<drfsupercenter> 03No, I'm not a MSI fanboy
<Rukario> my mobo is an asus as well
<Rukario> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03it's just the best thing I've found
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03Asus and MSI are cool like that
<Rukario> 3Mainboard Vendor: ASUSTeK Computer INC.
<Samurott> 07I have a max budget of around $1400 now
<drfsupercenter> 03since they make motherboards *and* laptops
<Rukario> 3Mainboard Name: Rampage III Formula
<drfsupercenter> 03versus companies liek SOny
<drfsupercenter> 03who just use other brands' boarsd
<drfsupercenter> 03well
<Rukario> 3Mainboard Version: Rev 1.xx
<drfsupercenter> 3Mainboard Vendor: ASRock
<NightSeas> 12Stupid Norton
<drfsupercenter> 03ASRock is basically ASUS
<NightSeas> 12not letting my install QuickTime.
<drfsupercenter> 03it's their uh
<NightSeas> 12me*
<NightSeas> 12:/
<Rukario> subdevision?
<drfsupercenter> 03it's basically their "experimental" stuff
<Rukario> XD
<drfsupercenter> 03because this motherboard
<drfsupercenter> 03breaks so many standards XD
<Rukario> ;p
<drfsupercenter> 03it has 12 SATA ports, and there's like 4 separate SATA controllers
<Rukario> so experiemental
<Rukario> experimental
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah
<Samurott> 07I'd mostly like to be able to enjoy better word processing on Windows, game with Portal/Portal 2 and Roller Coaster Tycoon games, and just browse internet and use mIRC like here
<drfsupercenter> 03the problem is sometimes there are random issues :P
*Samurott throws an apple at SilverSonic|Live
<drfsupercenter> 03and then there are motherboard vendors like Gigabyte who *don't* make their own computers
<drfsupercenter> 03Gigabyte is really good, never heard complaints about them
<drfsupercenter> 03so really, the 3 brands I trust for motherboards are MSI, Gigabyte and Asus/ASRock
<drfsupercenter> 03EVGA.. supposedly good but as ripoff as Apple
<drfsupercenter> 03Intel... it works, but again stupidly overpriced and under-powered
<NightSeas> 12Intel is pretty good
<drfsupercenter> 03their CPUs are, yeah
<drfsupercenter> 03but their motherboards are relatively lame
<drfsupercenter> 03they're "standard" meaning the usual set of one video card connector (PCIe x16), only 6 SATA connectors, etc
<drfsupercenter> 03they don't do anything cutting edge
<NightSeas> 12well yeah, not as good as their CPUs
<drfsupercenter> 03Gigabyte and Asus tend to do the most experimental stuff with motherboards
<drfsupercenter> 03just cramming as many ports and connectors on there as humanly possible
<NightSeas> 12XD
<drfsupercenter> 03hence why I have ASRock as it, for some reason, had more SATA's than Asus itself or Gigabyte
<drfsupercenter> 03anyway, brb

<NightSeas> 12it does have 4G though
<drf|laptop> 03my Droid 4 has 4G
*drf|laptop runs
<drf|laptop> 03as does the Motorola Xyboard which looks interesting
<drf|laptop> 03and I might tell articuno to get one as it's pronounced "Xai board"
*drf|laptop hides
<NightSeas> 12yeah
<NightSeas> 12LOL
<drf|laptop> 03LOL car commrecials that are using popular music
<NightSeas> 12"the new iPad has four times the resolution of the original iPad” <-- yay, comparing your latest product to a product that was made years ago?
<drf|laptop> 03XD all these TechNet downloads are direct HTTP links to the ISOs
<HyperMetalLugia> CAN I HAZ ONE
*HyperMetalLugia flee
<drf|laptop> 03sure
<drf|laptop> 03let me see if I can get the link
<EccoCode> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> EccoCode, you are a 5Tyrogue.
<HyperMetalLugia> LLOL NEW iPAd
<HyperMetalLugia> So lie
<NightSeas> 12^
<NightSeas> 12inb4: give it 4G and raise the resolution = new iPad :'D
<Samurott> 07I think it's a stupid name
<HyperMetalLugia> So like, the new ipad has charging issues (No charging when gaming), some Wifi reception problems, some screens have a yellow tint, it gets hotter, is a bit heavier, the apps are like 2x as big so 16GB of space wouldn't be enough :P
<Samurott> 07and overheating FTW
<HyperMetalLugia> The old smartcovers don't work
<HyperMetalLugia> And so on
<junh1024-XD> some old smartcovers don't work
<junh1024-XD> it depends on the orientation
<NightSeas> 12HML, all true but I like the fact that it's heavier :p
<HyperMetalLugia> Why?
<NightSeas> 12Heavy or GTFO
<HyperMetalLugia> It's a bit thicker and heavier LOL
<junh1024-XD> makes a betterdoorstop?
*NightSeas runs
<HyperMetalLugia> At this rate, get a laptop
<HyperMetalLugia> Oh and
<NightSeas> 12HML, it's harder to break heavy things
<HyperMetalLugia> The CPU is the same as before :P
<HyperMetalLugia> Uh
<HyperMetalLugia> No.
<NightSeas> 12unless you drop it
<junh1024-XD> inb4 willl it blend
<HyperMetalLugia> Well, I'm sure the only wayt o break it is to drop it
<HyperMetalLugia> So like, whoops? :P
<Samurott> 07The CPU is still dual-core, but can have up to quad-core graphics
<HyperMetalLugia> where is that link...
<NightSeas> 12Either way, I like it when a product is heavier. It just make it feel higher quality
<junh1024-XD> >mfw
<NightSeas> 12makes*
<HyperMetalLugia> Kal-El geforce/Tegra 3 has *12* GPU cores
<junh1024-XD> shall we tape bricks to your next laptop to make it "higher quality"?
*junh1024-XD hides
<drf|laptop> 03LOL
<NightSeas> 12:|
<drf|laptop> 03I'm not really paying attention to this but
<junh1024-XD> ┐(￣ー￣)┌
<Samurott> 07I think lighter is better, but overall I still think some weight needs to be present
<drf|laptop> 03as much as I hate Apple
<HyperMetalLugia> Plus, the NewiPad boots slower/is slower than the iPad 2 :V
<drf|laptop> 03I will say
<drf|laptop> 03supposedly it has >1080p resolution
<drf|laptop> 03which isn't bad for a screen of that size
<HyperMetalLugia> Well DRF
<drf|laptop> 03now, I'm not sure of the other tablets, e.g. Motorola, Samsung etc
<Samurott> 07I don't think tablets need to be much lighter than the current ones are
<junh1024-XD> so "HD" actually means "HD+"
<HyperMetalLugia> Whereisthatablet
<junh1024-XD> as opposed to = "HD-"
<drf|laptop> 03LOL hd-?
<drf|laptop> 03what is this, blood types?
<junh1024-XD> inb4 itunes rentals
<drf|laptop> 03I'm a type HD+
<drf|laptop> 03:>
*drf|laptop runs
<NightSeas> 12It has a higher resolution than any other portable
<junh1024-XD> below HD
<junh1024-XD> inb4 hidp
<drf|laptop> 03hidp?
<junh1024-XD> High Dots per Inch
<junh1024-XD> *hidpi
<NightSeas> 122048-by-1536-pixel resolution
<junh1024-XD> i don't even know my own bloood type
<drf|laptop> 03I don't either
<drf|laptop> 03I shoudl ask
<drf|laptop> 03as I've had a few blood tests recently
<junh1024-XD> i do bloood teste regularly too
<HyperMetalLugia> the acer iconia is HD
<HyperMetalLugia> er, A700
<HyperMetalLugia> Not released yet
<Samurott> 07I think it's pretty cool how the new iPad has more pixels than many HDTVs, but obviously Apple needs to work out cooling first
<NightSeas|Away> 12for a little bit I thought drf kicked me :/
<HyperMetalLugia> And seriously, the 'retina' display isn't a big deal in real life use
<drf|laptop> 03LOL what?
<HyperMetalLugia> "Oh wow, a gazillion pixels on a small screen"
<drf|laptop> 03why would I have kicked you
<NightSeas|Away> 12Apple link XD
<HyperMetalLugia> I'd prefer a bigger screen with real supported res plz
<Samurott> 07Link?
<NightSeas|Away> 12[14:52] <NightSeas> http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/
<NightSeas|Away> 12it just was a ping timeout
<drf|laptop> 03I didn't see that
<Samurott> 07Yeah, I've looked on the tech specs page before
<Samurott> 07Yeah, I thought the processor was quad-core until I looked there
<Samurott> 07just dual core with quad-core graphics
<NightSeas> 12yep
<HyperMetalLugia> http://www.dailytech.com/Report+Apples+A5X+Beats+Tegra+3+in+Graphics+But+Not+in+Pure+CPU+Performance/article24255.htm
<drf|laptop> 03Tegra is awesome
<drf|laptop> 03the Zune HD has one
<drf|laptop> 03the graphics are awesome but the lack of apps make it kinda crap :/
<HyperMetalLugia> So in conclusion, there isn't going to be a major improvement in actual graphics, but just resolution as all the power will be put into that.
<HyperMetalLugia> While the Tegra 3 can actually do some better physics/effects :V
<Samurott> 07Hmm
<Samurott> 07So that means the iPad isn't as good for processes but is better for video and the graphics of games
<NightSeas> 12indeed
<Ray> 02Not exactly
<drf|laptop> 03Angry Birds or gtfo
<drf|laptop> 03that's like, the only use for a tablet
<drf|laptop> 03IMHO
<NightSeas> 12^
<drf|laptop> 03because for videos... I have a $50 portable DVD player
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<drf|laptop> 03and they make portable Blu-ray players now
<NightSeas> 12I use my laptop for videos
<Samurott> 07Tablets are more tuned for leisure, with the possibility to use some applications that are actually serious
<NightSeas> 12yay 17.8 inch screen? :D

<Samurott> 07while laptops are much more serious and less portable
<drf|laptop> 03yeah but my leizure doesn't include carrying around crap that doesn't fit in my pocket :P
<Samurott> 07Meh, I dislike the smallness of most smartphones despite the pocketness
<NightSeas> 123DS and Android is what I use for leizure
<drf|laptop> 03I swear, Autostarts is the most useful Android thing ever
<HyperMetalLugia> Get a Galaxy Note.
<HyperMetalLugia> :V
<junh1024-XD> ..like bricks
*junh1024-XD hides
<drf|laptop> 03the Droid 4 has SO much crap that autostarts
<Samurott> 07with a tablet you can have a decent small case and it's still light
<drf|laptop> 03that it starts lagging even on a dual-core
<drf|laptop> 03and who's fault is that? Verizon >_>
<HyperMetalLugia> It's a tablet and a phone
<junh1024-XD> nononon
<drf|laptop> 03I removed most of the bloatware and it still has like 50 processes that start automatically
<junh1024-XD> it's a galaxy note
<Samurott> 07Tbh, I'm considering getting an Android that'll last me though Italy
<junh1024-XD> you can't disable them>
<junh1024-XD> ?
<drf|laptop> 03you can
<drf|laptop> 03using Autostarts.
<junh1024-XD> but...
<drf|laptop> 03it's the equivalent of using msconfig
<drf|laptop> 03the difference is
<drf|laptop> 03there are more events than just startup
<drf|laptop> 03there's like, text received, screen off, screen on etc
<drf|laptop> 03so I have a bun ch of random crap that tries to run itself when I turn the screen on or off
<drf|laptop> 03I disabled all that
<drf|laptop> 03:P
<drf|laptop> 03it makes the phone run a lot faster
<drf|laptop> 03requires root, obviously
<Samurott> 07So would you recommend Galaxy Note, drf?
<junh1024-XD> thank you for flying verizion. this text was bought to you by verizon
<junh1024-XD> ?
<HyperMetalLugia> DRF dislikes non-keyboard phones
<Samurott> 07I'm fine without a physical keyboard, unless it's a really bad touch one, like a few Droids I've used
<drf|laptop> 03Samurott if you don't mind touchscreen keyboards it's probably fine
<Samurott> 07I can probably take a look at it at the Vodafone store onbase
<HyperMetalLugia> Well DRF, It is pretty much the most powerful Droid phone, for now.

<drf|laptop> 03that's like $56

<HyperMetalLugia> Not again.
<HyperMetalLugia> LOLOL
<drf|laptop> 03oh wait
<drf|laptop> 03no
<drf|laptop> 03Up for the very first raffle is a Sapphire 6850. Once we get upto 75 bitcoins the raffle will be over and the drawing will take place. For the drawings I will post a video to show the process and to ensure that there is no monkey business happening.
<drf|laptop> 03that's stupid
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<Samurott> 07Seems as if the contrast is a little better on the Note
<HyperMetalLugia> Exactly
<HyperMetalLugia> Retina display is kinda a joke now :P
<Xanbreon> Notes a good phone
<HyperMetalLugia> I think the Note is 1280x800 or something silly
<HyperMetalLugia> Which means you can do HD properly yay?
<Xanbreon> It is
<Xanbreon> But its still on GB
<Xanbreon> :(

<HyperMetalLugia> grr
<Samurott> 07GB vs ICS?
<HyperMetalLugia> I'm not sure which is really better
<HyperMetalLugia> Android 2.3 vs 4
<Xanbreon> ICS is generally far better
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, there are a ton of new features in ICS
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<Xanbreon> Some apps aint ready yet
<Xanbreon> But the whole OS is faster and generally better
<Samurott> 07Oh yeah, the OS for Android
<HyperMetalLugia> Just buggy :P
<HyperMetalLugia> For unoffical
<Samurott> 07Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich
<Xanbreon> Eh, yeh
<HyperMetalLugia> Xan, what is CM9 like so far?
<Xanbreon> Varies from phone to phone
<Xanbreon> Its pretty stable and quick
<Xanbreon> Not finished messing about with it yet, but it looks a hell of a lot nicer than touchwizzed ICS
<drf|laptop> 03CM9 had issues on all the stuff I tried it on
<drf|laptop> 03hey Xanbreon, do you know of any good flashlight widgets, like that turn the LED flash on/off?
<drf|laptop> 03I used to use one called CamLED, but it got yanked from the market and apparently doesn't work on the Droid 4
<drf|laptop> 03as I just tried it, it can't find the LED LOL

<Xanbreon> Night
<drf|laptop> 03I'll try it
<drf|laptop> 03OK so
<drf|laptop> 03where are widgets usually stored, the ones that come with the stock OS?
<drf|laptop> 03I checked in /system/app and couldnt'find it
<Xanbreon> Depends
<Xanbreon> What one are you after?
<drf|laptop> 03I'm trying to get the Power Control
<drf|laptop> 03from my Droid 2
<drf|laptop> 03I flashed it back to stock
<drf|laptop> 03well stock+root
<Xanbreon> Its not going to work
<Xanbreon> Just copying it over
<drf|laptop> 03aw, why not?
<drf|laptop> 03an
<drf|laptop> 03and ow, I just blinded myself with the LED LOL
<drf|laptop> 03this app works, but it's weird, there's like a 1 second delay before the light actually turns on
<drf|laptop> 03not sure if that's hardware or software
<drf|laptop> 03CamLED was instant
*Xanbreon shrugs
<Xanbreon> Might be hardware
<Xanbreon> I explained before, its framework stuff
<drf|laptop> 03yeah but don't both use motoblur?
<Xanbreon> as its a system app it will reley on the framework it was compiled against
<drf|laptop> 03you know the widget I'm mentioning?

<prince-dari> >ops in their IRC
<prince-dari> XD
<Kjakings> 7hahaha
<prince-dari> Why are Americans so surprised I don't know who Miyazaki is.
<prince-dari> I don't know the name of anyone who makes anime.
<Kjakings> 7it wasn't Swaffy, surely? it was the other guy... umm... I've forgotten his name. or I'm just forgetting who Swaffy is. blue text, religious?
<junh1024-XD> Miyazaki is a director, his studio is Studio Ghibli.
<nickstr> I know who he is
<Umbreon> D:
<nickstr> heck I like quite a few Studio Ghibli movies
<drf|away> 02*WB03(Aeroslash03)02WB* - <Aeroslash> OREOS! :D
<junh1024-XD> you may know some of his movies such as Nausicaa, Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service, THe Borrower Arriety, Spirited away, Princess Mononoke, etc
<Kjakings> 7wasn't it... ACEEDWIN, I swear I remember an asshole called aceedwin. wasn't he the other tower?
<Umbreon> ewww
<Umbreon> you mean the person who is letting disney dub his work
<Umbreon> :P
<nickstr> I have seen Princess Mononoke
<nickstr> all I can say is *vomit*
<nickstr> its something of a gore fest
<nickstr> My Neighbor Totoro is one I like though
<junh1024-XD> its catchline is "live", apparently
<Angel_Espeon> 13Spirited Away <3
<junh1024-XD> i saw that in theatres
<nickstr> however my favorite is Kiki's Delivery Service

<nickstr> I really hope you are not one of those anime purists
<nickstr> I cant STAND them
<junh1024-XD> purist asin?
<nickstr> one of those who thinks anime should only be watched in Japanese
<nickstr> with or without subtitles in said viewer's native language if its not Japanese
<prince-dari> Hmm
<junh1024-XD> i've told tihs many times:
<prince-dari> Could be I suppose
<Skylands> 10Well
<junh1024-XD> i prefer {{dub where available}}}
<Skylands> 10I prefer subs, yes
<Skylands> 10but I don't despise dubs by any means
<nickstr> not everything is available subtitled
<nickstr> like about 90% of Pokemon
<nickstr> just a tiny fraction has been subtitled
<nickstr> and its only the newest episodes
<Skylands> 10I gave up on the Pokémon anime a long time ago
<Drake> 04>Pokemon Anime
<Drake> 04:3
<nickstr> I tend to prefer dubs
<Drake> 04I don't watch much anime. Only stuff people make me watch/convince me to watch
<nickstr> for what little I have seen
<Kjakings> 7I'd like to get this place going again. but the old guard have heard the 'revival' bullshit from me so many times already. it'd be nice if there was active interest from spyroforum, but I don't think anyone there knows this place exists... does anyone even go there any more?
<Drake> 04I mean, I got onto the Index/Railgun bandwagon because of my friend, and now Skylands is making me was PMMM
<nickstr> but yes I don't watch much anime either

<Skylands> 10Hm?
<Hawkie> well i shall bug him when he returns!
<Viri> 14D: Hawkie y u no orange DD:

*Viri gives oranges
<Skylands> 10Yes
<Drake> 04Ok, I'm glad someone does.
<Drake> 04I was worried there for a second.
<Skylands> 10I feel like there's a term for that as well, just can't put my hands on it
<Drake> 04Same.
<Skylands> 10Why do you ask?
*Skylands makes you feel embarrassed for asking :P
*Drake blushes
<Skylands> 10Oh u
<Drake> 04Not really sure actually. I just constantly wonder how I'm generally against online-only relationships, and yet there have been several times where I've been interested in someone I haven't even met IRL yet.
<Skylands> 10Same
<Skylands> 10I am against online relationships too, but I'm in one :'D
*Skylands contradicts herself and doesn't mind
<Drake> 04XD
<Skylands> 10I use the excuse, "It just happened,"
<Skylands> 10Because that's the truth, tbh

<Rukario> i don't know
<Rukario> well NightSeas that was an understatment
<Rukario> when the official PO server went down
<Rukario> all the 300 something players they had would all relocate to another server
<Rukario> for some reason it'd be the HoR server

*Xanbreon sighs
*Skylands leans on Xanbreon
*Xanbreon nuzzles Skylands
<Xanbreon> Movie looks intresting
<Xanbreon> First thing that came to mind was Battle Royale tbh
<Xanbreon> :3
<NightSeas> 12I have no idea why TL fans like it though. It's nothing like TW o.o
<Skylands> 10Xan, it's compared to Battle Royale often
<Xanbreon> Sky, I am not supprised
<Skylands> 10TL? TW?
<NightSeas> 12and I don't mean that in a good or bad way
<NightSeas> 1212Twlight
<Xanbreon> TW being twilight
<Xanbreon> but whats TL?
<NightSeas> 12just T, but w/e
<Xanbreon> twilight as well?
<Xanbreon> :/
<Drake> 04I dunno why Twilight fans like THG
<NightSeas> 12^
<Drake> 04they're entirely different
<Skylands> 10The whole 'love' aspect
<Xanbreon> Eeehh
<Drake> 04For one, there's actual emotion
<Skylands> 10Gale and Katniss, Peeta and Katniss
*Drake runs
<Skylands> 10Jacob and Bella, Bella and Edward
<Xanbreon> From the trailor it doesnt look very scifi
<Drake> 04Gale and Katniss, I never liked that one
<Xanbreon> apart from its in the future
<Xanbreon> ;/
<Xanbreon> *set in the
<Drake> 04I prefer Peeta and Katniss. Because Peeta's cool
<Drake> 04Xanbreon, it's post-apocalyptic
<Skylands> 10I dunno if I like either pairing
<Drake> 04almost
<Skylands> 10I just fancy the plot
<Xanbreon> Suppose
<Drake> 04the plot matters more than the pairings
<Drake> 04as opposed to Twilight
<Xanbreon> Looks more science fantasy than fiction..
<Skylands> 10Twilight's also a couple years old
<Skylands> 10Those rabid fangirls have to go somewhere
<Xanbreon> (scifi: star trek scifiction: star wars)
<NightSeas> 12lmao
<Xanbreon> For the kind of distinction
<Drake> 04XD nice one Sky
*NightSeas sends them Drakes way
<Skylands> 10Not even sure how THG came to be that way
<Skylands> 10"Oh hey, a bunch of people are reading this, that means we must do so too!"
<Skylands> 10Domino effect
<NightSeas> 12true Skylands
<Xanbreon> Might be good, doesnt look earthshattering
<Skylands> 10Tons of people at my school haven't read the books, but they go to see the movie
<Skylands> 10Just to fit in
<Xanbreon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py_IndUbcxc
<Xanbreon> :D :D :D
<Drake> 04THG isn't earth shattering
<Xanbreon> I cant wait for that
<Drake> 04it's a good book that I don't want spoiled by Twilight fans
<NightSeas> 12the only reason I want to see the movie is the book
<Skylands> 10My little sister is a prime example
<NightSeas> 12if I hadn't read the book I wouldn't care about seeing the movie
<Skylands> 10She actually had to red the first book in her english class a year or two ago, before it became big
<Xanbreon> This trailer makes me squeee
<Xanbreon> =3
<Skylands> 10She said she didn't like the story
<Skylands> 10and then all the sudden, once there's a movie
<Skylands> 10"I'm gonna go see this with my friends and read the other two books!"
<NightSeas> 12LOL
<Skylands> 10I poked fun of her for that, she acted all butthurt
<Xanbreon> Damn dirty kids and there weirdness
<Skylands> 10Like, "No! I never said that!"
<Drake> 04"Space Nazis from the Moon"
<Skylands> 10or "Well, you must have misheard what I said"
<Xanbreon> Drake, best premise everrrr
<Skylands> 10Excuse me, sis, but I know what I heard
<Xanbreon> =3
<Drake> 04ikr
<NightSeas> 12she could say it was a IRL typo
*NightSeas runs
<Drake> 04Honestly I only ended up reading the book in preparation for the film
<Drake> 04I'd always intended to read it beforehand, but I kept forgetting
<Drake> 04Xanbreon
<Xanbreon> Drake
<Drake> 04"I'll see you in valhalla"
<Drake> 04valhalla
<Xanbreon> <3333
<Drake> 04WHY ARE GERMANS USING VALHALLA
<Drake> 04AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
<Xanbreon> Silence
<Xanbreon> Cos its got a cool name
<Skylands> 10I read that as 'Why are Germans using vanilla'
<Xanbreon> Oh god

<drf|laptop> 03I ordered one on ebay
<drf|laptop> 03hopefully it's the same one
<junh1024-XD> i got mine from the bay of pirates
<drf|laptop> 03when I get mine I'll read off the proeduct number
<drf|laptop> 03you see that on the bottom of the disc?
<junh1024-XD> actually there are multiple ones, and theyre different sizes
<junh1024-XD> OEM, retail,
<junh1024-XD> 1CD, 2CD, etc
<drf|laptop> 03well I want the actual discs
<junh1024-XD> gotta have your shiny microsoft logos
*junh1024-XD walks
<drf|laptop> 03Dell discs aren't shiny
<NightSeas> 12true, I have a MS Money disk and it's very plain XD
<junh1024-XD> i have a MS money ISO. It's quite plain.
<drf|laptop> 03inb4 MS Money? That's redundant
<NightSeas> 12lolwut
<NightSeas> 12I collected it. Never used it XD
<junh1024-XD> saem
<NightSeas> 12every nerd must have stuff like that for no reason
*NightSeas runs
<DarkLugia> This picture is cute http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRO39AIRRu5ff3w_aGnPxnu4yHJUNYB0wYyEnSAvqJM7_350oNeNa0vvlu0
<drf|laptop> 03what the FRICK DarkLugia
<drf|laptop> 03nobody here is into that furry stuff >_>
<NightSeas> 12EW
<junh1024-XD> but DarkLugia claims it's cute!
<NightSeas> 12Ew furries :/
<drf|laptop> 03^
<drf|laptop> 03at least something we can all agree on XD
<Xanbreon> ORLY
<junh1024-XD> http://i.imgur.com/PeoNg.jpg
<NightSeas> 12XD
<drf|laptop> 03so Xanbreon
<drf|laptop> 03I broke my phone
<junh1024-XD> http://www.sfdm.scad.edu/faculty/mkesson/vsfx419/wip/spring11/shannon_dingle/images/dog-fur.jpg
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Xanbreon> So drf
<drf|laptop> 03software
<junh1024-XD> ^ here's some furry stuff
<drf|laptop> 03I apparently deleted one too many APKs
<Xanbreon> Good jorb
<drf|laptop> 03so now it crashes on boot
<drf|laptop> 03and Google Maps doesn't work
<junh1024-XD> well done!
<Xanbreon> What did you remove? :P
<drf|laptop> 03luckily, since I knew deleting APKs was problematic
<drf|laptop> 03I made a vanilla backup
<junh1024-XD> http://puu.sh/5cZI
<drf|laptop> 03as in
<drf|laptop> 03I rooted + recovery, then backed it up
<drf|laptop> 03so I'll restore that
<drf|laptop> 03and uh
<drf|laptop> 03all the system crap that I didn't want
<Xanbreon> This is why you freeze them, reboot, then see what happens
<Xanbreon> :/
<drf|laptop> 03the motorola crap
<drf|laptop> 03I used titanium backup
<drf|laptop> 03to "uninstall"
<drf|laptop> 03well
<NightSeas> 12I'll show you cute: http://www.android.com/media/android_vector.jpg
*NightSeas RUNS
<drf|laptop> 03LMAO NightSeas
<drf|laptop> 03anyway Xanbreon, can ADW free and/or EX just hide apps from the drawer?
<Xanbreon> drf, probs, dunno
<drf|laptop> 03since if I do that, and I disable them from running on boot, that's basically just as good?
<drf|laptop> 03and that way they're sitll there if programs require them
<DarkLugia> well that was a bigger reaction than I thought .-.
<Xanbreon> drf, this is why you freeze, reboot, see what happens
<Xanbreon> then remove if everything works fine
<drf|laptop> 03as apparently Google Maps requires some of that bloatware ;/
<drf|laptop> 03ah another question I had
<Xanbreon> Google maps doesnt need any of motarolas stuff
<Xanbreon> You must have nuked something google
<Xanbreon> You could just flash gapps
<drf|laptop> 03is there *any* benefit to doing a full (as in powre off, power on) reboot opposed to a hot boot?
<drf|laptop> 03LOL, or remove the built-in maps and then download it from the market? :P
<Xanbreon> Depends what you need todo
<drf|laptop> 03well
<Xanbreon> Some stuff is reloaded on kernel boot
<Xanbreon> Others on OS boot
<drf|laptop> 03what would hotboot not w...oh
<drf|laptop> 03well
<drf|laptop> 03I usually reboot if I'm deleting apps and have problemks
<drf|laptop> 03-k
<drf|laptop> 03would it be more beneficial to do a full reboot?
<Xanbreon> Nah, most app stuff will be userland
<drf|laptop> 03or sometimes if my service dies, I have to reboot, hot boot usually *doesn't* work for that
<Xanbreon> So hotreboot is fine
<drf|laptop> 03though it's odd
<Xanbreon> Service death will need hardreboot as the kernel will need to fireup the baseband again
<drf|laptop> 03Verizon was advertising that their 4G lets you do voice+data at the same time
<Xanbreon> Or eh
<drf|laptop> 03but yet
<drf|laptop> 03I called someone earlier and the little 4G icon disappeared
<Xanbreon> Actually, dunno, depends on which SoC you have as to what bit fires up the baseband
<drf|laptop> 03well apparently Motorolas need full reboot
<drf|laptop> 03but that answers myt question really
<Xanbreon> Kernel or bootloader then
<drf|laptop> 03I noticed there were some times when a hot reboot didn't fix my problems but a full reboot did
<drf|laptop> 03and I was curious if I was just seeing things
<drf|laptop> 03but OK
<drf|laptop> 03I'll just add a "long reboot" button
<drf|laptop> 03to the widget
<drf|laptop> 03(Power Control plus_)
<Xanbreon> ^^
<drf|laptop> 03see
<drf|laptop> 03I can use Poewr Control Plus to replace the regular one
<drf|laptop> 03but the brightness one borks
<drf|laptop> 03regular power control does like 1/2/3/auto-brightness
<drf|laptop> 03PC Plus only does 1/2/3/4
<drf|laptop> 03and I want auto-brightness >_>
<Xanbreon> O-o
<drf|laptop> 03wait WTF?
<drf|laptop> 03Windows Vista Business is only available to volume-license TechNet subscribers?
<drf|laptop> 03I can get ultimate/enterprise but not business?
<drf|laptop> 03That's a**backwards
<drf|laptop> 03hm so Xanbreon, do you know how the enterprise OSes work, serial-wise?
<drf|laptop> 03since apparently with my technet, I only get one key for enterprise since it'
<drf|laptop> 03s "volume license"
<nickstr> I guess I picked a decent platform then for mobile devices
<drf|laptop> 03does that mean I can use that same key a bunch of times?
<nickstr> plenty of emulators
<Xanbreon> drf, it might be valid for more than 1 activation
<nickstr> and no circumventing firmware blocks
<drf|laptop> 03how would I find out how many o.o
<Xanbreon> No clue drf, see if they have a FAQ
<Xanbreon> or email them
<drf|laptop> 03I get free chat support
<drf|laptop> 0324/7 supposedly
<drf|laptop> 03I can go ask them right now XD
<Xanbreon> Do that
<drf|laptop> 03oh cool, they have the acutal XP SP1a installer (240MB) on here
<drf|laptop> 03all the yhave on the public site is some stupid 2MB web-based installre that doesn't work anymore
<drf|laptop> 03shame that stupid Java thing happened
<drf|laptop> 03TechNet Online Chat
<drf|laptop> 03You have unlimited online chat service.
<drf|laptop> 03of course there's someone ahead of me XD
<junh1024-XD> ohaydere
<junh1024-XD> How do magnets work?
<drf|laptop> 03Holy crap Xanbreon
<drf|laptop> 03Apparently those 3 product keys I get for regular Windows
<Xanbreon> Mhhm?
<drf|laptop> 03can be activated 10 times
<drf|laptop> 03so that's 30 activations LOL
<drf|laptop> 03and they said the enterprise ones do 500(!) activations
<drf|laptop> 03that's fricking amazing
<Xanbreon> At the same time? Or before you need todo phone activation?
<drf|laptop> 03at the same time.
<Xanbreon> Nice
<drf|laptop> 03Please wait for an agent to respond. You are currently '1' in the queue.
<drf|laptop> 03Privacy Statement
<drf|laptop> 03You are now chatting with 'Sam'.
<drf|laptop> 03Danny Forche: Hello, I had a question
<drf|laptop> 03Sam: Hi Danny. Thank you for contacting the TechNet Online Concierge. How may I assist you today?
<drf|laptop> 03Danny Forche: I notice that for the Enterprise versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7, I only get one product key - does that allow multiple activations?
<drf|laptop> 03Sam: Thanks for your inquiry. Yes, the Multiple Activation key can activate 500PCs.
<drf|laptop> 03Sam: And please kindly notice that one retail key can be activated 10 times.
<drf|laptop> 03Danny Forche: Ah, so with the regular versions (Windows 7 Professional, etc), I can use each of my 3 keys on 10 PCs?
<drf|laptop> 03Sam: Yes, correct.
<drf|laptop> 03Danny Forche: Thanks
<drf|laptop> 03^ fricking awesome stuff
<Xanbreon> You can get keys with upto 1000+ activations
<drf|laptop> 03well sure
<drf|laptop> 03but I only paid $300
<Xanbreon> :P
<HyperMetalLugia> awesome
<drf|laptop> 03I should just give Win7 enterprise to all ym friends
<drf|laptop> 03with that one key
<drf|laptop> 03I don't even know 500 people :P

<Xanbreon> Nope
<junh1024-XD> inb3 UNIX subservices for windows
<HyperMetalLugia> Are there any time upgrade keys?
<HyperMetalLugia> :s
<Xanbreon> You can put a normal key into anytime upgrade
<HyperMetalLugia> can I anytimeupgrade vista HP to Professional/Biz?
<HyperMetalLugia> :<
<HyperMetalLugia> So I can upgrade this stupid desktop to 7 :V
<junh1024-XD> you can, but you lose WMC ad possibly games
<junh1024-XD> (if you care aboiut those
<Xanbreon> Not to sure about how it works with vista tbh
<HyperMetalLugia> > Never use media centre and games
<HyperMetalLugia> :o
<drf|laptop> 03<HyperMetalLugia> Are there any time upgrade keys? <- what Xanbreon said
<drf|laptop> 03you can use them as anytime upgrade
