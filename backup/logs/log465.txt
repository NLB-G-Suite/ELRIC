<Lil_B> The SID Chip in the C64 was a 6581
<alexxm> good so far Hat

<Lil_B> Im voting for Assembly Demos
<Vordox> Bits are 4 binary numbers
<Life_Essence> there's videos of a buy in youtube that does physics really cool
<Vordox> I think..
<Vordox> It was it 8?
<Lil_B> Vordox yes 8
<Phase4> 00,02a bit is a single 'switch'
<Phase4> 00,02its 0 or 1

<Phase4> 00,02its more of a memory problem
<overcastgabe> xbox 360 have 3 gigs
<Major_Frank> http://bit.ly/rLXUc0
<Vordox> overcastgabe: Yet they have such incredible games
<Phase4> 00,02the ps3 had a bizare memory layout
<Major_Frank> Damimt
<Major_Frank> Wrong one
<Vordox> When is graphics GOING too good while gameplay goes lower. =/
<junh1024-XD> 11.•10«11WB10 (Lighty10) 11WB10»11•. 10- i sooo love e-mail, i win atleast 5 cars everyday
<Major_Frank> http://bit.ly/KmGve0 <-- right one
<SirGanjalf> I'd say it's a processor problem too
<Phase4> 00,02not realy
<Life_Essence> overcastgabe: because memory is where its at
<alexxm> so is rage good
<Phase4> 00,02ps3 has a fairly powerfull processor
<alexxm> has the chat derped
<Major_Frank> :\
<overcastgabe> yes but thingk of this i can barly run border lands at max settings
<overcastgabe> at 40 fps with 16 gigs
<MysteryPony> OBJECTION
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: how does ps3 have bizare memory layout
<Major_Frank> Why are we talking about consoles..
<Vordox> Prototype...MY WORST ENEMY
<Vordox> As a game designer
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hey Ghosties \)
<overcastgabe> ps3 had 1 gig of ram
<alexxm> so is rage good
<Airpuff> Hahaha Vordox xD
<overcastgabe> thats why fallout and nv for ps3 doesnt work good
<Vordox> Airpuff: It's true =/ My personal enemy
<dshannon> loooooool
<Ghosties> 04Hello Shane
<Airpuff> Vordox: Ehehe :O
<Life_Essence> PS3 CPU is more like a GPU
<Phase4> 00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, 256MB system memory, 256MB gpu memory, both exist inside the same address space
<Phase4> 00,02bandwidth problems
<dshannon> ohhhh dat babe
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: iz that good?
<overcastgabe> the cpu is the gpu!
<alexxm> hey Alicorn_Prince_Shane hows your day been
<SirGanjalf> alexxm: Good if you speak about tachnology
<dshannon> bom chica wow wow
<overcastgabe> the cell broad band engine is both in one
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> goo alexxm
<Phase4> 00,02plus audio memory is in a strange place too
<SirGanjalf> But it kinda fails in gameplay
<Vordox> Phase4: The new PS4 is on the go, so is Xbox and WiiU...
<SirGanjalf> *technology
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: iz what u said good?
<Phase4> 00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, the mapping is, but theres not enough memory for most engines
<Vordox> Phase4: There'll be huge improvements over these 5-6 years of the Console gaps
<overcastgabe> audio on ps3 suck i cant use my 3 k bose system
<Lil_B> Vordox Sony said that they won't
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> so its bad Phase4 and wens ps4 coming out
<Vordox> Lil_B: It will.
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, i saw a thing that claimed to be the tech specs for the ps4
<Phase4> 00,02it claimed some epic large numbers
<Vordox> Phase4: Anything interesting?
<dshannon> my problem wasn't the graphics I really didn't care about
<Phase4> 00,02similar memory setup
<overcastgabe> i have the smallest game on earth
<Life_Essence> Vordox: anything has to be better than the ancient tech that is current gen consoles
<Phase4> 00,02but 10GB instead of 256MB
<OtakuTom> We won't see anything about PS4 until next year (unless Sony goes back on their word and announces something at E3 this year)
<dshannon> its that I started on the hardest difficulty
<Vordox> Phase4: That's...very very unrealistic...
<dshannon> and got 10 hours of gameplay
<Phase4> 00,02plus the thing looks like a damned supercomputer
<Airpuff> Phase4: 10 GB?! o.o
<Vordox> Phase4: The risks of having that much within a console station is...
<Lil_B> Vordox say specifically said, that they believe the PS3 will work from at least 2 more years
<Phase4> 00,02256 SPU's, compared to the 7 in the ps3
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: is the ps4 coming out?
<Nerom> Dude how will someone afford that machine? just saying
*alexxm hugs Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<overcastgabe> thats going to use a lot of money meaning loss of profit if it doesnt sell
<Phase4> 00,02but this is all rumor, not sure of anything
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane licks nuzzles alexxm
<Life_Essence> you thik it won't sell?
<Phase4> 00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, late next year iirc
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: LEGASP
<overcastgabe> dude 10 gig of video ram thats fuck 5k on a normal computer
<Vordox> Phase4: There's a chance they may have that power, but the cost would be epensive... Unless they reuse old software to maintain that high order of specs. D:
<Airpuff> overcastgabe: i know right.. overkill... -.-
<Phase4> 00,02the cpu was allso somewhat a hinderance for cross platform, but i blame that on lazy programers
<Nerom> And here is where console contracting begin
<overcastgabe> my laptop is 8 time faster than an xbox 360 and a 360 is 300$ my alptop was 800$
<Life_Essence> overcastgabe: but RAM isn't the only thing in the system, someone could make a GPU with 10GB of RAM quite cheaply
<Phase4> 00,02fun fact: acording to that document the ps4 will be backward compatible with every other playstation
<overcastgabe> think of it a 5000$ xbox who the hells going to buy that
<alexxm> who the hell could afford that Phase4
<overcastgabe> but will they get rid of it
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: LEGASP SRS
<overcastgabe> the reason why ps3 got rid of backward compatibility
<Nerom> And apperently not have a disk drive from what i heard
<Phase4> 00,02ps3 got rid of it due to cost
<overcastgabe> is because they need 4 cd drives
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: whats the expected price for thr PS4?
<Phase4> 00,02it had the ps2 hardware in it
<overcastgabe> that what i mean
<overcastgabe> you can emulate offical games
<overcastgabe> cant
<Phase4> 00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, no idea, more than i can afford thats for sure
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: 1000$?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> o hai Airpuff
<Life_Essence> PS4 will run solely on Steam
<Airpuff> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: Atleast :P
<Vordox> Phase4: WAIT!? we can play ALL backwards games?!
<Airpuff> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: And hai :)
*Alicorn_Prince_Shane nuzzle, tickles and licks Airpuff
<Vordox> Even back as PSX?!?!?!
<Lil_B> 1099 UD-Dollars!
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, yes
<OtakuTom> lol, Live_Essence
<overcastgabe> now imageion backwards for ps3 ps 2ps1 psx ps 4cd and blu rays
<overcastgabe> !!!!
<Phase4> 00,02they probably just wrote emulators
*Airpuff laughs from being tickled by Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<Airpuff> >.<
<Vordox> Phase4: I find that VERY VERY ...lying..
*alexxm hugs Airpuff
<Phase4> 00,02heck, ps1 and 2 emulators already exist
<Vordox> Phase4: The amount of lost revenue for doing so, would be millions.
*Airpuff hugs alexxm back :P
<overcastgabe> yes but a legit disk is required
<Phase4> 00,02to make emulators?
<Phase4> 00,02probably not
<Life_Essence> ps2 ones aren't very good though
<overcastgabe> legit disk dont emulate
<Vordox> Thats the same reason WII has the emulator inside the game, to be buying old library stuff for a cheap cost.
<Phase4> 00,02its cpu is compatible with the ps3, and they had most of a ps2 emulator already
<Vordox> It may be cheap, but the amount of selling is past millions of dollars.
<Twi_Fi> Isn't Sony already in a bit of a financial pinch?
<overcastgabe> yes they are
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: one question if we had a backwards compat ps3 and played Starwars BF 2? could we play it online?
<Vordox> Twi_Fi: Depends
<alexxm> Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<Life_Essence> WII has awesome retro games for it
<alexxm> Alicorn_Prince_Shane http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o05xPuZF2I8
<Airpuff> All i say, the best machiene when it comes to multiplayer games: N64.
<Airpuff> xD
<Life_Essence> and can ever run youtube
<overcastgabe> no because starwars shutdown the server last year
<Phase4> 00,02and with the ammount of power they have, being lazy with the ps1 emulators performance is acceptible
<Lil_B> Twi_Fi yes, they loosing a lot with their electronics department
<Life_Essence> Airpuff: Golden Eye
<Phase4> 00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, i assume so
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: LEGASP
<Airpuff> Life_Essence: Mario cart .. Mario party. Super smash.
<overcastgabe> i miss mercenares
<Life_Essence> Airpuff: 4 fat guys in towels in the snow
<overcastgabe> it was a good game for ps2
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> well guys im off to play max payne 3... again
<Vordox> Atleast sony is progressing the tools
<Airpuff> Life_Essence: ahaha
<Lil_B> Airpuff i agree, best Multiplayer games XD
<Vordox> That 2Sided Television is a great addition to gaming
<Phase4> 00,02anyone want to see a talk about the ps3's security system?
<overcastgabe> i got a joke two person walk in a bar i forgot the rest
<alexxm> bye Alicorn_Prince_Shane
<Vordox> Phase4: Pre theft or post?
<Phase4> 00,02pree
<Phase4> 00,02pre'
<Airpuff> Lil_B: They were so fantastically easy. But awesomely entertaining :
<Phase4> 00,02i think
<Vordox> Sure. :P
<dshannon> meh why not
<dshannon> I'm feeling lazy and ignorant
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: why is it really good? or over the top
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: r u gonna stream it?
<OtakuTom> lol, sounds like a good laugh
<Phase4> 00,02its broken in the funniest way
<overcastgabe> think of this what if we could invent a universal disk drive it would make millions
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: wut is
<Phase4> 00,02there are some idiots at sony
<Lil_B> In japan Sony had a programm so you could Get Your PSP games online for a small price for the Vita, but not in America or Europe :/
<Phase4> 00,02the ps3 security
<overcastgabe> mabey even SEXTILIONS
<overcastgabe> the sony surity sucks
<CrimsonPhoenix> what is this?
<overcastgabe> sony spent 50 million on make sonys copy protection
<Life_Essence> FAIL OVERFLOW
<Phase4> 00,02allso some stupids at nintendo, someone used strncmp instead of memcmp, which ment you could fake sign things
<Life_Essence> very fitting
<Phase4> 00,02hence homebrew channel
<overcastgabe> the copy protection can be defeated by a marker
<alexxm> which is Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02Life_Essence, the ammount of fail in the ps3's security is huge
<overcastgabe> a fucker maker kills 50 million dalars
<Phase4> 00,02alexxm, a way to run homebrew on the wii
<Phase4> 00,02sry about the volume
<alexxm> thanks Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02its that way on my copy too
<overcastgabe> 50 million by a craona ONE CRAOLA
<Lil_B> I think i'll try to put Homebrew channel on my wii when i get the wiiU and play all my Wii games on there
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, you should, theres some cool stuff on it
<overcastgabe> overcastgabe: blewup
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> so Phase4 is this a talk about ps4? or?
<Life_Essence> wii had a good run? they make it sound like it's dead
<Phase4> 00,02the xbox had a very lazy security system, the 360 on the other hand was much better
<Phase4> 00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, ps3's security system
<Lil_B> Phase4 I know, like Emulators and Musicplayers, but right now I'm to worried to brake it
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> hha Phase4
<overcastgabe> xbox was ok
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> this is gonna be funny for ps3
<Vordox> Phase4: Why not just do it like "all out"
<Vordox> Phase4: Fuck security.
<Phase4> 00,02you cant run homebrew on the 360, but you can run pirated games
<Vordox> Phase4: Play openly.
<Phase4> 00,02little strange
<Airpuff> Phase4: what makes the 360 suck though, is its design making the machiene ofthen end in a death from overheating xD
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, they screwed up bad with the 360's hardware
<Airpuff> >.<
<overcastgabe> i have the best idea ever universal disk drive like all cds ever blu ray to vhs!?!?!?
<Life_Essence> Airpuff: that's why you pull it to bits and improve
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff: u kno for example some games life final fantasy on 360 theres 4 disks but on ps3 theres one
<overcastgabe> yeah byt the rrod could be fixed easy
<overcastgabe> i fixed the rro xon a 2005 xbox
<Lil_B> Sony is such a lying company
<overcastgabe> rrod
<Lil_B> lie*
<overcastgabe> that 2005 xbox is still working to this day
<Airpuff> Alicorn_Prince_Shane: no.. i didnt know that xD
<alexxm> bye guys
<Vordox> You know...remove all hackers and the world wouldbe safe, but so ..so...wat's the word?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Airpuff: well now u do
<Lil_B> bye alexxm
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> bai alexxm

<Life_Essence> have fun alex
<overcastgabe> well need hackers
<overcastgabe> to show how good companies care about you
<Vordox> overcastgabe: Not need.
<Nerom> Hacking is good for the comunity in someways and bad for it in others just saying
<Phase4> 00,02Alicorn_Prince_Shane, buffer overflow, you could run code from a usb if you did some strange stuff
<overcastgabe> microsoft can make or breka you for being suspectd
<overcastgabe> i was broke
<Vordox> overcastgabe: If we removed all safety on consoles, it would be better, but less personal information = Better to "push away " hackers
<dshannon> ? why is ps2 grey?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> why iz ps3 not been hacked yet
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> Phase4: run code?
<overcastgabe> i was broke my microsoft bought an illigal car on forza 4

<Vordox> Phase4: Who are they....poking fun at?
<Twi_Fi> This video amuses me.
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, sony
<overcastgabe> newcloppingrepublic.tumblr.com
<doughnutjoe> overcastgabe give me a better link
<Vordox> Phase4: So they are exposing issues?
<Deadeagle> lol
<overcastgabe> www.newcloppingrepublic.tumblr.com
<Vordox> <.<
<Vordox> How is that a bad idea?
<Vordox> Just cause "They want revenge"?
<Lil_B> One does not simply... piss of hackers
<rdibp> hey guys, wat are we watching
<Deadeagle> overcastgabe: OH GOD
<dshannon> because now they are out to destroy them
<rdibp> OVER 9000
<Twi_Fi> Hello rdibp
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, have you ever seen what happens when you try to controll a geeks tech?
<overcastgabe> i told you!
<Phase4> 00,02<< this is what happens
<overcastgabe> dont watch it!
<dshannon> aaaaaand he IS outa heeere!
<overcastgabe> DONT
<rdibp> what are we weatching?
<rdibp> watching*
<Phase4> 00,02rdibp, a talk about the ps3's security
<dshannon> gooodbyeee overcast!
<Vordox> Phase4: Buuuuut....
<Deadeagle> well i have no interest in ps3 sorry XD ima outta here
<doughnutjoe> Dear Princess Celestia, Today i learned what clop means .-.
<rdibp> is this like e3 or something?
<Vordox> Phase4: It's dumb, by hackers...
<Vordox> Really dumb
<Twi_Fi> Cya Deadeagle
<overcastgabe> I TOLD YOU DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISH WIREDO
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, they enjoyed using other-os on their ps3's, sony stopped them doing that
<Vordox> Makes them look like pure criminials out for revenge rather then having a reason for what they may be able to do
<Phase4> 00,02so they fixed it
<overcastgabe> risk
<Vordox> Phase4: But it's LEGAL on their part to do so
<Vordox> ._.
<Lil_B> Vordox Its basicly, "Oh you want to do that? Well we don't let you!" and the hackers are like "Well, we gonna show you D: !"
<doughnutjoe> but im sooooo curious its dangerous
<rdibp> I dont understand this, i dont speak telechonese.
<Phase4> 00,02and its legal for the hackers to do so ^_^
<Bronysith> http://arch.413chan.net/1288859782062.jpg
<overcastgabe> yeah like i jailbroke my iphone
<Vordox> How is IT legal for them to CHANGE PS3?
<rdibp> technolonese
<overcastgabe> the goverment says one you but it you have full rights
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, they own the device
<doughnutjoe> Cause they are chinese
<overcastgabe> thats how i can jailbreak my iphone leagly
<overcastgabe> buy
<Phase4> 00,02can do whatever you want with something you own so long as you dont break any other laws
<Vordox> Phase4: Correct, and everything within it as a full schematic.
<Lil_B> Vordox, it is their PS3, they have the right to do anything with it they ont.
<XAX> Implying jailbreaking is illegal
<doughnutjoe> and chinese people are powerful
<XAX> Which it isn't
<XAX> Here at least
<overcastgabe> like if you dont pirate if fine
<Vordox> Lil_B: Yeah, that's my point
<overcastgabe> if you dont pirate
<Vordox> Phase4: Which is fine, so how is it legal for Hackers to change things within it?
<rdibp> achivement unlocked: become a hack nerd
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, because they own the device
<Phase4> 00,02i'm allowed to change the software on my laptop
<Vordox> Phase4: Oooh, thye implemented a OS3?
<Phase4> 00,02ps3 is the same
<Vordox> Phase4: I thought that was not true anymore
<overcastgabe> doughnutjoe: just earned trophy clop for 1 hour you wirdo
<XAX> dshannon: Remember when they said they were going to put that law in place here that would fine you if you torrented? Lol.
<Phase4> 00,02thats what the geohortz case was abotu
<Phase4> 00,02about'
<Vordox> Phase4: Geohortz?
<Phase4> 00,02kinda annoyed they settled that one, never set a precident
<dshannon> .......yes....wait no?......that happened?
<rdibp> do you think valve is just trolling us by saying they arent going to present anything at E3 this year?
<doughnutjoe> overcastgabe thats not very nic
<Phase4> 00,02http://hackaday.com/2011/04/12/geohot-case-settlement/
<dshannon> :D
<overcastgabe> well you wanted to know
<overcastgabe> aparently you wanted to see it
<XAX> dshannon: That did cone into effect. I just havnt heard anything about it. Me and my mates still torrent like crazy and none of us have heard shot about it.
<overcastgabe> spoa passed now a uk student is being extrdited for terrist act for dowloading 1 song illigaly
<overcastgabe> us i lake a uk student
<rdibp> whats spoa?
<overcastgabe> is takeing
<Vordox> SOPA has not passed yet
<Vordox> It won't pass.
<XAX> Phase4: Didnt geohot like... invent the jailbreak for the iPhone or somehint
<XAX> something*
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, yeah, he did that too
<overcastgabe> geohot did the iphone AND the ps3
<rdibp> the internet will NEVER DIE!!!
<doughnutjoe> ^
<XAX> Phase4: What was his main accomplishment?
<Phase4> 00,02he worked on the ps3
<Twi_Fi> XAX: <Notice> You are to cease and desist all torrenting activities immediately.
<XAX> Ph
<XAX> Twi_Fi: k sorre admon won't do it agen
<Phase4> 00,02something about some keys he leaked or some thing he did to his ps3 made seca angry, so they tried to sue hi
<Phase4> 00,02him'
<Lil_B> Well, with the Rasberry Pi, hacker groups are already making plans to "make a second Internet" with low-orbit sattelites and consumer ground stations
<rdibp> dat accent
<Phase4> 00,02as such the code he wrote to create signed executables was mirrored by damn near everyone
<Phase4> 00,02i have a copy
<DeadpoolDash> heh heh heh heh....this touches me in a special place... http://fim.413chan.net/art/src/132648590590-Marvel_secret_butt_f.jpg
<Phase4> 00,02<< what their talking about now
<Twi_Fi> Lil_B: You serious!
<Phase4> 00,02he wrote code to creat 'self's
<Bronysith> i can survive on a diet compised entirely of crayons and lighter fluid
<XAX> Phase4: What would you use said code to do?
<Phase4> 00,02run code on the ps3
<doughnutjoe> i....i...i think im gonna delete my history now..... O-o
<Bronysith> composed
<XAX> What kind of code? What would it let you do on your PS3?
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, anything
<Lil_B> Twi_Fi currently, its only plan, but it is possible with recent technology with not much money
<Twi_Fi> ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!
<XAX> Play me some pokemon red on my PS3
<Bronysith> i can survive on a diet composed entirely of crayons and lighter fluid
<Phase4> 00,02yup
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, but sony doesnt want you to do that
<XAX> That's cool :o
<Twi_Fi> Lil_B: That is something I have wondered if it could be possible.
<Phase4> 00,02hence the court case
<XAX> /
<doughnutjoe> im gonna go now bye
<doughnutjoe> bye
*XAX doesent even own a PS3
<Twi_Fi> Lil_B: I'm happy that such things are being considered.
*XAX kind of wants a PS3
<Twi_Fi> Bye doug..........noooooooooo, gone!!!!!!!
<Phase4> 00,02too many loaders
<Lil_B> Twi_Fi the Sattelits would be about ballon sized, you could launch a hundret with one go, and the ground stations would be ~100$ but right now, its all theoretical
<Bronysith> i can survive on a diet composed entirely of crayons and lighter fluid
<XAX> I would probably only use it to play PS1 games from the store, and PS2 games that I have. I'm down right horrible at playing FPS games on consoles.
<XAX> I can't do I for the life of me
<XAX> it*
<Lasharus> I'm pretty happy with my own PS3, overall. Despite all the complaining about consoles. And XAX, finding a PS3 that's backwards compatible to PS2 games is very hard now.
<Bronysith> ps3 is okay
<Bronysith> PC GAMING FOR LIFE
<XAX> Lasharus: fffffffffffffffff
<Lil_B> Twi_Fi but its so awesome that all f this is very much possible, and nobody would shoot them down, because you don't want scrap metal floating around, hraming all other sattelites XD
<Lasharus> Only the very first few models did that, most of the later ones no longer had the backwards compatibility.
<XAX> Bronysith: Omgyes
<Lasharus> I have one of the very first models. *smug*
<Phase4> 00,02the ps3's with 'emotion engines' are rare and expencive
<OtakuTom> I like my PS3, but I accidentally broke my backwards compatible one >_>
<Lasharus> Phase4: That's why I'm smug. :P
<OtakuTom> So I had to go back to my PS2 for the old games.
<overcastgabe> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOj-Ssf4y8&feature=related watch i dare you worst them my last post it will smash you mind in to puny cracker
<XAX> Phase4: Emotion engines? >_>
<Bronysith> XAX: u a pc gamer?
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, the ps2's cpu
<Phase4> 00,02Lasharus, lucky you
<XAX> Bronysith: Since I was 3
<Lasharus> I'm just a gamer Bronysith. PC, PS3, DreamCast...
<OtakuTom> The PS2 which is modded, btw
<Lasharus> I don't care about the medium, gimme games.
<Bronysith> Lasharus: pc gaming is best gaming
<Phase4> 00,02now this right here is epic fail
<Lasharus> Oh no no no, not going into a "best platform" discussion.
<Bronysith> I CAN SURVIVE ON A DIET OF CRayons and lighter fluid
<Lasharus> Each platform has its merits and demerits.
<Bronysith> Lasharus: cept PC its just really good
<Lasharus> Oh good grief.
<overcastgabe> oh plese i can surrvive a diet of hot pockets
<XAX> Phase4: But what if you jailbroke it? Would it play PS2 games then?
<Lasharus> I greatly enjoy PC games. I also greatly enjoy PS3 games. I.e. stuff the 'best system' concept.
<Phase4> 00,02that line of code is a high-school i learnt on basic mistake
<Lasharus> Any questions?
<Bronysith> overcastgabe: they are the same thing really
<overcastgabe> thats hard they fucked eplode in your hand nearly killing youw ith 1degree burn from melting cheese
<Twi_Fi> I love how everyone applauds after each ding.
<Phase4> 00,02XAX, not without the hardware or an emulator
<XAX> Right
<Bronysith> Phase4: can u survive on a diet of crayons and lighter fluid?
<Phase4> 00,02this bit
<Lasharus> Admittedly, squealing about how hard the PS3 failed now is a bit behind the curve, if I'm honest.
<Phase4> 00,02is epic fail
<Phase4> 00,02sony failed so hard
<Lasharus> Yeah, they screwed up. Oh deary me.
<Phase4> 00,02Bromany, lighter fluid is probably toxic
<Lasharus> Are there games on my PS3 that I like? Yes? Okay, I'll go play those games then.
<Bronysith> im Bronysith
<Bromany> huh ?
<Bronysith> Phase4: im Bronysith not Bromany
<Lasharus> I realise they buggered up massively, but at the same time, it doesn't affect me and it won't affect me, so I feel very little reason to go up in flames about it. :P
<Phase4> 00,02lol
<Phase4> 00,02sry
<Bromany> ^^
<Bronysith> Phase4: its fine
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bromany and Bronysith
<Lil_B> how old is the guy talking right now?
<Twi_Fi> Hello Bromany
<Bromany> hi there, Twi_Fi
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, dont know
<Phase4> 00,02thats the fail right there
<RainbowAsh> The same random number every time? Did they roll a dice and hardcode the result?
<overcastgabe> what would happen if we combined brony and the steam store?
<Twi_Fi> Hello RainbowAsh
<RainbowAsh> Hi Twi_Fi
<Phase4> 00,02k
<Phase4> 00,02is the private key
<Phase4> 00,02the bit thats suposed to be secret
<Vordox> That's...the secret?
<Lil_B> I hate k from all of my Physics lessons :/
<XAX> wat
<overcastgabe> i honestly have a derpy hoover floting around my screen
<overcastgabe> hooves
<Phase4> 00,02with it, you can sign things and they are indistinguishable from sony's signitures
<Vordox> ....
<XAX> Phase4: THE MIGHTY K
<Vordox> LAWL
<overcastgabe> www.desktopponies.com
<OtakuTom> lol xkcd joke
<overcastgabe> dare you
<XAX> overcastgabe: Implying no one else knows about desktop ponies
<Vordox> Full open sources...
<overcastgabe> oh so im suppoed to have my pen and stick it in my tv?
<Lasharus> Yeah, just do that.
<Lasharus> Then film it and put it on youtube
<Lil_B> maybe they should show Desktopponys on the Stream... would be a nice addition :V
<Lasharus> Goodness knows I could use a laugh.
<Bronysith> DESKTOP PONIES WHY YOU NO WORK FOR ME!!!
<Bronysith> rage
<Lasharus> Lil_B, more than half the streamers have that program active.
<Bromany> actually, i didn't know about desktop ponies till yesterday :'(
<Lil_B> Lasharus I know XD
<overcastgabe> no it would derpy hooved will make it buffer and then say i JUST DONT KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG!
<XAX> Bronysith: I have a boot screen rainbow dahs
<Lasharus> Ah, sorry, I failed to pick up on the sarcasm.
<XAX> dash*
<Vordox> Phase4: So they go through XBox an Wii too?
<Vordox> Phase4: Or are they bias arseholes? =P
<overcastgabe> ive been up for 2 days !??!
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, these guys did the wii, other guys did the xbox
<overcastgabe> crap
<Vordox> Phase4: Good, hate one sided critizise. :P
<Lasharus> Agreed.
<overcastgabe> omg todays monday shit!!
<XAX> overcastgabe: How old are you?
<pony_911> wat is this?
<Lasharus> If they'd only focused on the PS3, I would've discounted most of this. :p
<Lil_B> Vordox Nintendo didn't really pissed off so much people XD
<Bronysith> overcastgabe: doesnt matter to me i am outta school
<overcastgabe> 14
<XAX> Ah.
<Twi_Fi> Hello pony_911
<Bronysith> well
<Phase4> 00,02the ps3 had horribly broken security
<pony_911> hi whats this?
<Phase4> 00,02but the xbox was worse
<Bronysith> time to pl,ay kotor
<Vordox> Phase4: Thank you :P
<Phase4> 00,02pony_911, talk about the ps3's security system
<Lasharus> The XBox had a shoddily designed console. :P
*XAX is still reppin' the PS2
<Phase4> 00,02i'm probably going to reboot and play a game now
<pony_911> ohh i dont have a ps3
<Lasharus> I mean, if the original console is practically guaranteed to fail? Something's misdesigned. :p
<pony_911> my xbox does need a upgrade asap though
<Lasharus> Ghehe.
<Lasharus> I don't own an XBox.
<Lasharus> Oh no, wait, I tell a lie. When my brother went to China he gave me his old one. It's gathering dust... some...where.
<Vordox> That question, her her her
<Lasharus> Damnit, now I'm going to have to search for it, aren't I?
<Phase4> 00,02the xbox's security is broken, the xbox 360's is ok
<Phase4> 00,02except for the fact that you can pirate games
<Phase4> 00,02cant run your own code but you can pirate
<Lasharus> True enough Phase4, but the XBox 360's console design is a bit worrisome for me.
<Phase4> 00,02:P
<Phase4> 00,02its hardware is shoddy]
<overcastgabe> I cant pirate games its no ok with my religion
<Phase4> 00,02i have a broken one here, suffered 3 different faults
<Lasharus> Sorry, but if "to red-ring" becomes an industry for completely failing, I tend to shy away from buying the system. :P
<Phase4> 00,02reboot time!
<Lasharus> *an industry term
<Lil_B> when doesn E3 start again?
<overcastgabe> i fixed the rrod permanetly for my 2005 orignal xbox 360
<XAX> Phase4: Sleep time
<overcastgabe> just do a headsink mod
<Lasharus> I'm impressed. That's fairly rare.
<XAX> Have fun with your games
<Lasharus> Sleep well XAX
<pony_911> the only problem im having now is that i cant connect to xbox live ....yet
<Twi_Fi> Goodnight XAX
<Lil_B> are you going XAX?
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> night XAX

<overcastgabe> good mooning? pax
<Lil_B> ok, good night XAX

<Lasharus> Phase4 is just rebooting, then he'll stream games.

<Lasharus> Oh come on overcastgabe... :P

<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> #spamcentral
<|Discord|> Rule:This is not a roleplay server. RP consits of acting as a certain charecter or having fake battles in the chat. Rule:No emotocon spam please. We hate it just as much as the next guy so no emotocon spam.

<Phase4> 00,02Ghosties, Ping
<Phase4> 00,02Ghosties, Ping Ping
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> Is Phase4 summoning the god?
<Dr_Robotnik> Well, that appears to be the sensible thing to do here.

<Vordox> Ghosties: Wake up.
<valoreins> wat a lovely day... bronystate got visited by some new kids...
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> Do not awake the silent serpent!
<Dr_Robotnik> But yeah, if my taking the role of Dr. Robotnik as a joke was annoying, I do apologise.
<|Discord|> valoreins: More like trolls if you ask me
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> Dr_Robotnik: :D
<Dr_Robotnik> Amusement was my intent, after all, not annoyanc.
<Vordox> Dr_Robotnik: This is merely a social stream and chat.
<Dr_Robotnik> *annoyance.
<valoreins> well they are acting like one
<Vordox> Dr_Robotnik: any other activieis can be refered elsewhere
<Dr_Robotnik> That's fair enough.
<Dr_Robotnik> I just picked it up for a laugh after the whole emote spam.
<overcastgabe> overcastgabe: blows up
<Vordox> Dr_Robotnik: How would you like it if a random person ran into your house and starting doing yoddeling? :P
<Dr_Robotnik> And be honest, if I'd ordered the Egg Fleet to fire and they'd then get banned, you'd have laughed. I know I would've. :P
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> I swear, I come on this chat and there is dancing, mass licking, or emote spam.
<Vordox> Dr_Robotnik: I would... XD
<Vordox> Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: Don't forget Dusting
<|Discord|> Lolz you guyz
<Dr_Robotnik> Anyway, I'll try to curb the joke RP a bit. :)
<valoreins> and glomp pile
<Vordox> CHAAASE
<overcastgabe> yeah got to go fast real fast your too slow way fast cool totaly radical gotta speed up
<Dr_Robotnik> So, with that in mind, back to Lasharus.
<overcastgabe> chilli dogs
<overcastgabe> thats no good
<|Discord|> Oh my god why does he call her Miss Jane?
<Lasharus> Much better.
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> inb4 Lasharus gets banned.
<Lasharus> Why would I get banned Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit?
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> Lasharus: Just kidding.
<Vordox> Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: If anything he fed the troll, nothing too bannable about that
<Lasharus> It's against the rules to threaten with bans. You could get banned.
<Vordox> Dat_muffin and overcastgabe is the ones in danger here.
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> But I have not the power.
<|Discord|> Lasharus: Do you know of any good roleplay servers?
<Lasharus> (Is it against the rules? I have no idea, really :P)
<Phase4> 00,02sry bout that
<Phase4> 00,02power dropped
<overcastgabe> in the thin ice
<|Discord|> It is aganist the rules
<Lasharus> None whatsoever |Discord|. I just picked up RP'ing Dr. Robotnik some time ago through a forum.
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> I have not the power........
<Vordox> Phase4: Right in a chase? :(
<overcastgabe> im on the thin ice
<Phase4> 00,02 Vordox yup
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> |Discord|: What is?
<Phase4> 00,02i totaly didnt fail right after either
<Lasharus> We had a halloween event where we could change our forum names, so I became Dr. Ivo Robotnik. And started an Ask Robotnik thread.
<Phase4> 00,02<_<
<Lasharus> It's still going strong. :P
<Phase4> 00,02>_>
<|Discord|> Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit: Rolelay
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm, wont let me restart the stream
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> I laugh at that rule because roleplay happens waaaaaay too often here.
<Lasharus> After 76 pages of answering questions, it's astonished me. :P
<Vordox> Well good streaming then Phase4 XD
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> I tend to stay away from doing so while on the mane chat though.
<Phase4> 00,02!ping
<Phase4> 00,02huh
<Lasharus> Yeah, same here Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit. I just succumbed for once. :p
<Phase4> 00,02my internet still works
<overcastgabe> two shots are what ever its like tug of war trying to pull myself togeter im a pimp under pressure live my money on the dresser
<Phase4> 00,02wonder what happened there, power went again
<overcastgabe> leave
<overcastgabe> tell me where is that from
<Lasharus> A pretty bad song.
<overcastgabe> yep
<Twi_Fi|biohazardsuit> Lasharus: You had succumbed to the dark side of the chat.
<Lasharus> The moment the word 'pimp' is mentioned, it's almost certainly going to be a bad rap song, and thus loses my interest altogether.
<Phase4> 00,02ok, i cant seem to push to the embed
<Phase4> 00,02gona change it
<Vordox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PjIhs72l0A&feature=fvwrel <--- While we wait
<overcastgabe> two are what ever its like tug of war tring to pull myself togeter i could problably do beter but that like never im a pimp under pressure
<overcastgabe> lol
<Lasharus> See? Again with the 'pimp' reference. I'm going to assume the horrendous song's title is something like 'pimp under pressure', because the guy can't seem to ramble about anything else.
<Phase4> 00,02ok, everyone refresh your streams
<Phase4> 00,02had to change embed
<the_real_pony_1604> streamseption

<Twi_Fi> So ponies only became a focus later or was it always since the site's inception?
<Hawkie> i was more thinking age but ok
<pony_911> the internet is so boring these day
<Hawkie> :P
<Viri> 14HAWKIE
<RyunosukeKnT> just because we like ponies, doesnt mean that ALL we like are poneis :)
*Viri glomps
<Twi_Fi> It doesn't?
<Twi_Fi> Oh
<RyunosukeKnT> besides
<Hawkie> titi
<Hawkie> hihi*
<Hawkie> LOL
<Skylands> 10Hawkie, PM?
<RyunosukeKnT> ponies 24/7 would get real old real quick ;)
<Espeon> oo
<Ascendant> nice one Hawkie
<Twi_Fi> Yeah I guess.
<Ascendant> and hah
<Ascendant> I'm not as old as you yet
<Ascendant> >:p
<Starflash> Twi_Fi: began as a movie night for bronies :3
<Twi_Fi> Some bronies are already getting burned out now as it is.
<Twi_Fi> And it is making me sad.
<Starflash> what, how the community is pretty much degrading?
<Phase4_> THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE WORKED XD
<Twi_Fi> Starflash: Degrading?:(
*Espeon old?
<StupidSexyCJ> one should always tkae ponies in moderation, just like anything addictive and potentially hazardous to your health
<Starflash> well, that may be a bit too extreme.
<Starflash> but you know what I mean.
<Ascendant> you're ancient
<Twi_Fi> Starflash: Yeah, I think I do.
<Twi_Fi> We need that Fighting is Magic game ASAP.
<Espeon> ;;
<Starflash> ikr
<Phase4_> every second of that last room i did all wrong
<Phase4_> and it worked
<StupidSexyCJ> huh aaaahhh
<Phase4_> this game is soo much fun XD
<pony_911> Twi_Fi the hell we do ,when will it come out again?
<Phase4_> >fuse in paralel
<Phase4_> if you're an electronics nerd you'll know why thats wrong
<Starflash> eeyups
<Hawkie> Skylands sure
<pony_911> pew pew
<Hawkie> haha, ilu guys
<Twi_Fi> pony_911: I'm not sure. Trying to find out now.
<Twi_Fi> Actually, does anypony know when the Fighting is Magic game is intended to come out? It looks from the website that it won't be for a long time.
<Starflash> You got kicked by Phase4_. You will explode in 3 seconds.
<Phase4_> XD
<Starflash> bge logic
<Bromany> watching beyond good and evil really makes me miss the good old platformers like: Donkey Kong 64, Banjo Kazooie/Tooie, Conkers Bad Fur Day and so forth
<Phase4_> what the heack
<StupidSexyCJ> Fighting is Magic will be become the Duke Nukem Forever of brony games, calling it now
<Phase4_> did you guys hear him die?
<pony_911> Twi_Fi i dont think it will come out at all
<Starflash> StupidSexyCJ: what do you mean?
<ehm> Twi_Fi: The usual fan-made reply is, "when it's ready".
<Espeon> Then i r glad
<Twi_Fi> pony_911: They are still working on it, but the longer it takes the less likely it will be finished.
<Irish_Pony> Hey everypony Im back from destroying tanks :)
<Twi_Fi> In my opinion.
<Twi_Fi> Welcome back, Irish_Pony.
<Twi_Fi> ehm: True.
*Skylands dead tired
<StupidSexyCJ> Starflash: we'll wait years for it to come out, then when it does, the finished product wont be quite what we were expecting
<Twi_Fi> ehm: And if it takes them time to do it right, then I welcome it.
<Irish_Pony> Dat voice acting
<Starflash> ahh.
<ehm> ask that in any fansub channel, and you're likely to get banned for pestering them :p
<Skylands> 10Couldn't fall asleep due to the warm weather, I suppose
<Starflash> oh well
<Skylands> 10Last time I checked my clock, going on 3:30am
<Twi_Fi> I would try to create my own game if I had any knowledge or talent in the area.
<Skylands> 10And we've woken up to hear our air conditioner outside is making odd noises, that'll need to be fix. I pray it doesn't just suddenly stop working
<pony_911> Twi_Fi how long has it been since the projrct started?
<ehm> then mod some other game
<Espeon> at least here the nights aren't as warm .ww.

<Clover> transformers robots in deguise
<Kandarihu> We need to get some anime on this stream that's a bit less stereotypical. Too much action.
<RaveBrony> Only killed about 20 people :) np
<Soital> 12otherwise we wouldn't have been able to hold one back in school =)
<Sumica> 00,10oh rick is great at saving the world

<Kandarihu> Great. I check The Pirate Bay. It's right there, but now I have to figure out magnet links.
<Videofreak1127> Dken2021: Oh ya. Just finished reading it. It's a future military setting with some dark themes

<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: darn you shoulda told me i bought it for me and sb64 yesterday

<Princess_Cadence> o.o brb i need to pay for staying lol
<Luna_of_Assassins> Also, everyone has to download Mine Little Pony, so we can have PONY HUNGER GAMES
<Videofreak1127> Dken2021: It gets pretty screwed up in parts
<CupcakeWarrior> Luna_of_Assassins: But Im not hungry
<|Discord|> DerpStar: I doubt it bro. Most girls hate me cause I am well...anyoing. I would like to meet a nice Pegasister one day but that will have to wait
*Magical_pablez94 barf with |Discord| hearing at Trixie's name
<Kandarihu> I looked at Civ V on Steam. Looks like the devs are being a bit mean with the DLC
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The only thing I hated about last night game night: We never hit a sever with mod support.
<Princess_Cadence> back
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have mine little pony
<Very_Silly_Filly> But why is my skin Bonbon D:
<Luna_of_Assassins> Nittany_Discord: All those Luna retextures gone to waste??? :'(
<|Discord|> Nittany_Discord: Those servers dirve me crazy! HEY YOU GOT POINTS TO SPEND! I hate that...
<Dken2021> never could get mine little pony mod to work
<Magical_pablez94> Very_Silly_Filly: it's random :D
<Bronysith> ILL BRB EVERYPONY have to work. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL
<Very_Silly_Filly> I know that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I mean ones supporting user mods.
<|Discord|> ovr and ovr and ovr agian it just sucks
<Shizuka> 13it's cause you're modifying models and textures, which makes sv_pure mad
<Dermathil> is your copy ready, Kandarihu?
<Shizuka> 13and we were on official servers all night
<DoublePint> First I'm a woman |Discord|, just adjust your way of thinking I'm sure she'll come along
<Princess_Cadence> Be patient you'll see,you may call it fake but this is real MAGIC....REAL MAGIC
<Very_Silly_Filly> sv_pure: umad
<Shizuka> 13sound mods worked perfectly for me
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In other words, my MLP weapon skins didn't show up.
<Magical_pablez94> Very_Silly_Filly: mine was a fluttershy *d'awwwws*
<DoublePint> lol DerpStar don't need to jack my laptop
<|Discord|> DoublePint: Maybe your right.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not for me.
<Shamroc> Nittany_Discord: yep...
<Kandarihu> Not yet. I'm gonna try to torrent it, but last time I was on TPB, there were torrent links. Not anymore.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And I have a sound mod.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Two.
<DerpStar> It was closer!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01One for weapons, and the jockey mod.
<Princess_Cadence> aww man :( i need to go now
<Very_Silly_Filly> Guys, we really need to do techniks on MC if we haven't done already
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01None of them worked.
<Very_Silly_Filly> For MP
<Dermathil> Kandarihu: all you need to do now is to click on the magnet, Kandarihu. It works pretty much the same way as before.
<Luna_of_Assassins> I need a BRIAN BLESSED mod
<alexxm> bye Princess_Cadence
<Princess_Cadence> see you all at june 5th now everybrony/pony! :(
<Very_Silly_Filly> Honestly, the only reason I actually play the damn game
*DoublePint sighs
<Sylandest1> laters, Princess_Cadence
<Mirju132> bye Princess_Cadence
<DoublePint> Cya Princess_Cadence
<|Discord|> Ya know what I find funny? Kriz kept me on his friends list after the game. I assumed him to take me off right after but he didn't...I wonder why?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I found a funny mod that replaces the opening cinematic of L4D2 with Mister Davey's Cupcakes animation.
<Shimmer> Princess_Cadence: brohoof
*Princess_Cadence waves sadly and goes
<Kandarihu> I click on the magnet and Firefox asks me what program to use to open magnet links.
<Om> I think I may have acidentaly ingested some plasitc
<Luna_of_Assassins> Nittany_Discord: I have that :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't install it because I couldn't dare stream that.
<CCCP> STOP CISPA
<Mirju132> :(
<CCCP> CISPA new SOPA
<|Discord|> CCCP: It already passed dude
<CCCP> :O
<Shizuka> 13i just disable the opening vid..
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It hasn't.

<SOPA> IM HERE TO CENSOR YOU ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01RIAA and MPAA are worst ponies.
<Luna_of_Assassins> To quote Left 4 Speed 2: "That, was the scariest ******** thing that I've ever seen in my entire life."
<Shizuka> 13WE HAVEN'T HAD A CRISIS ON THE INTERNET THIS WEEK FIND ONE NOW
<alexxm> bye Magical_pablez94
<Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: this. very much this.
<DerpStar> You guys in the States still pasing laws like that?
<CCCP> bye Magical_pablez94
<Very_Silly_Filly> Shizuka: The trolls trolled me agen :c
<Magical_pablez94> bye
<DerpStar> Cya Magical_pablez94
<|Discord|> Saturn: Whats up bro? /)
<DoublePint> Bye Magical_pablez94
<ACS13123> Shizuka: you could do the fact i wasnt here yesterday to watch the stream :'(
<Saturn> 08,01inb4 i move to sweden into wrek's basement.
<Magical_pablez94|EAT> bye
<Kandarihu> DerpStar: you make it sound like the American People in general are in favor of it.
<Luna_of_Assassins> I outsourced my resource mining in Minecraft to my little sister :D
<Saturn> 08,01|Discord|: i'm listening to pony music
<Dken2021> have fun Magical_pablez94|EAT
<Very_Silly_Filly> No Saturn, stay at Britain where it's British
<|Discord|> Saturn: Sounds fun to me
<Kandarihu> All I heard about so far is the U.N. wanting to regulate the internet.
<Irish_Pony> Saturn: Or come here to Ireland and have a pint!
<Saturn> 08,01Very_Silly_Filly: but... sweden has wrek, and internets and stuff
<Dken2021> Kandarihu that's because the majority don't even know it exist
<Saturn> 08,01Irish_Pony: YES
<DerpStar> No I'm just saying your government is still trying to pass laws that are extremely unpopular
<|Discord|> I will stay at America because this is the only country with good burgers.
<Luna_of_Assassins> I'd like to visit Britain sometime
<Very_Silly_Filly> But Britain has british people. And me
<Meanwhile> One does not simply regulate the internet.
<Shizuka> 13not trying, succeeding
<Airpuff|Drawing> GilDash: Which color do you wanna be? xD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah. Hollywood meddling in politics to support their forced; heavily controlled and outdated business models and copyright-based censorship makes my blood boil.
<Shizuka> 13and that's the wonders of a political elite that shields itself from its constituents
<|Discord|> Airpuff|Drawing: I will be green
<Kandarihu> Dken2021: you know that's not true.
<Very_Silly_Filly> As soon as you get used to the amount of sex spam we have, you'll come to like britian quite a bit
<Shizuka> 13who will continue to vote them in because they don't know better
<Luna_of_Assassins> Would any British bronies mind if I just randomly showed up at your flat and stayed for about a week?
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff|Drawing: Eh, I'll be the Rainbow Dash colors.
<Dken2021> not sure why you would move to another country, the locals will hate you too
<Shimmer> Any diablo 3 gamers? Feel free to add me, Thendris#2436 on european servers :)
<|Discord|> Shizuka can be purple, and Nittany_Discord can be blue!
<Airpuff|Drawing> Omg guys xD
<Meanwhile> Luna_of_Assassins: It's not a flat but it does have a large couch. Also several cats and a dog.
<Airpuff|Drawing> GilDash: You there?
<Sylandest1> Airpuff|Drawing: i believe gil is away right now, sorry, lol
<Shizuka> 13color?
<Airpuff|Drawing> Sylandest: .. meh >.<
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01CISPA hasn't passed the Senate yet.
<Om> Airpuff|Drawing: Last I heard it was buisy.
<Luna_of_Assassins> Meanwhile: I'll bring my alergy meds for the cats.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Luna_of_Assassins: I wouldn't mind, but wouldn't really have room
<Irish_Pony> http://ninjapony.deviantart.com/art/Dead-Tea-Drinking-Nazi-216609523 Richtofen?
<Airpuff|Drawing> Shizuka: yeah making GilDash 's OC
<TheRainbowDash> Airpuff|Drawing: Is anything wrong with my color choice?
<Luna_of_Assassins> I like cats though
<Kandarihu> Well, internet freedom needs to become more of a hot-button issue.
<|Discord|> Shizuka: Someone asked what colors we should be
<|Discord|> lol
<Sylandest1> Airpuff|Drawing: went to go get food, i believe. should be back in a few minutes or so
*Shizuka 13is between pink and red
<Airpuff|Drawing> Sylandest: kk.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Since no tech companies are against it, I don't see an internet blackout coming from CISPA's possible passing.
<Airpuff|Drawing> Shizuka: hmpf.. so you think i should make it something between that then?
<Shizuka> 13for what
<Shimmer> So you're sore Shizuka?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Gah, all this talk of us British is making me luster for a nice cuppatea
<Kandarihu> We should be urging the tech companies to oppose this. We are their users.
<alexxm> I want more wenches More wenches and mead Lots of wenches is what I need
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Best thing to do is to vote out the bill supporters.
<DoublePint> Honestly I don't think you guys should be overly worried about these things
<|Discord|> I must say Pizza I am eating is simple marvolis. I must get more of it, BUT WHERE!?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka is light red.
<Luna_of_Assassins> I think I'd do all the things they do on the YogPod. I'd eat jaffa cakes while listening to Tina Barret.
*Shizuka 13is medium rare
<Luna_of_Assassins> Then I'd watch Bryan Blessed
*Nittany_Discord 11,01wants pizza
<RainbowAsh> Nittany_Discord, I'd hope non-commercial sites like wikipedia would speak up against it at least
<alexxm> what pizza is it |Discord|
<Airpuff|Drawing> >.>
<|Discord|> Luna_of_Assassins: Are the Yogscast bronies?
<|Discord|> alexxm: Hawaiin
<Dken2021> I could go for a good panini right now
<Luna_of_Assassins> I think Simon is. They did do Sunshine of Israpony
<Luna_of_Assassins> Also Hannah might be
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01So ham and pineapple?
<Shamroc> Shizuka: when were you cooked?
<|Discord|> Luna_of_Assassins: Well what title does that make fun of?
<Shimmer> I'm making tacos for dinner! In b4 everypony jelly
<|Discord|> Nittany_Discord: Yep
<Very_Silly_Filly> I find it retarded how american government will affect the whole world
<Luna_of_Assassins> Shadow of Israphel?
<Shizuka> 13was burned years ago
<alexxm> i heard firefox is against CISPA
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01/)
<Dken2021> |Discord| delicious! <3
<|Discord|> Nittany_Discord: \(
<DerpStar> Well DoublePint and I are off its a nice day and we have plans to make!!!
<|Discord|> ops
<Very_Silly_Filly> I can say that's a slightly selfish comment, but seriously, you're running america, not ALL the countries
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I love pineapple on my pizza.
<|Discord|> Nittany_Discord: (\
<|Discord|> Nittany_Discord: I do to
<Very_Silly_Filly> Blaegh, pinaples *dies*
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I usually get pepperoni and pineapple.
<Kandarihu> There's one Senator from my state who is DEFINITELY part of the problem. But he's not going to be up for reelection until 2014.
<Shimmer> Eww pineapple
<Om> Very_Silly_Filly: I agree with you. And I live here -_-
<Luna_of_Assassins> Very_Silly_Filly: We have the most nuclear weapons and the largest military. Basically that unfortunatly gives us license to do whatever we weant.
<LordCelestia> 0,5I like bacon on my pizza
<Shamroc> Shizuka...so that makes you cooked?.......
<LordCelestia> 0,5and barbeque sauce
<LordCelestia> 0,5and pineapple
<Very_Silly_Filly> Um..well. I have Fluttershy.
<LordCelestia> 0,5mmmmmm
<DoublePint> Actually one quick bragging point before DerpStar steals my laptop
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I hope Pat Toomey goes next election cycle.
*Very_Silly_Filly aims Fluttershy at America
<|Discord|> Nittany_Discord: Dont think I am gross or anything...but i like chocolate and bananas on my pizza
<Dken2021> had barbeque pizza once, it was awful
<Dark_Horst> LordCelestia: dude, wat?
<|Discord|> yum
<Om> Very_Silly_Filly: Please fire.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I should try that.

<alexxm> is it out yet DoublePint
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01But possibly less.
<alexxm> i heard firefox is against CISPA
<DoublePint> No Dken2021 early screening at the con I went
<Dken2021> Dark_Horst iirc, the ones at dominoes do
<Kandarihu> At the same time, we need to make it clear that piracy isn't harming the entertainment industry. And we also need to make it clear that the anti-piracy IS harming our freedoms.
<Luna_of_Assassins> Firefox is made by people
<DoublePint> And DerpStar stayed home :p
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Letting senators and rep who supported internet censorship bills stay in office is wrong.
<Luna_of_Assassins> they would be
<Dken2021> Dark_Horst no wait, papa john's
<Dken2021> DoublePint lucky you :\
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Papa Johns is good, but expensive.
<Meanwhile> Und then chat was a whole bunch of stuff about internet censorship and whatnot.
<alexxm> was it good DoublePint
<Meanwhile> Also pizza. Apparently.
<Luna_of_Assassins> How old does one have to be to run for Senate?
*Nittany_Discord 11,01dust Meanwhile
<Dark_Horst> Dken2021: who ARE those people.... also i think it should be ham. not bacon.i thinkz

<RainbowAsh> alexxm, ok so far. As good as completely back to health. Good thing too, because there is a lot of work wating for me during the next few days.
<Invi> is it a good or a bad thing that i never visited 4chan?

Her exact role is difficult to tell, but she is believed to be an assistant in
<BlueFlare> 2Patchouli's library, due to being the midboss of her stage.
