<Zuxxez123> Hello Meanwhile
<AJIsAwesome> ohai, Meanwhile! :)
<thelonepony> hi Meanwhile
<FlutterMEDIC> Pinkie and Goku http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1927/
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Meanwhile.
<Invi> hio Meanwhile
<Invi> dat +K
<Stary> Invi: Hi's are the best thing around! In fact, hi Invo!
<AJIsAwesome> FlutterMEDIC: I can see that happening. :D
<FlutterMEDIC> hi Invi
<Michael> FlutterMEDIC: awesome
<Meanwhile> So what're we watching?
<FlutterMEDIC> HI FOR EVERYONE
<Stary> Man I meant to say Hi Invi
<AJIsAwesome> I see Saturn is streaming, correct?
<Stary> Yeppy do!
<Invi> Stary, you did ^^
<Everlasting_Joy> FlutterMEDIC: There's an old pic, but one of my favorites :).
<AJIsAwesome> YAY!
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Meanwhile!
<Meanwhile> If you type part of a name and press tab Stary it'll fill the rest out by itself.
<Stary> Ohhh okay :p thanks for the tip! :)
<Zuxxez123> Meanwhile: That saves up on time. Lol.
<Meanwhile> You're welcome.
<CriticKitten> DOne.
<Everlasting_Joy> Stary: Just make sure the name is the one you want.
<FlutterMEDIC> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1526/ RUN WOONA
<Stary> Everlasting_Joy: Yep
<CriticKitten> 14 question test, 6 of which are ball busters. Let's see my calc kids brag how "easy" this is. >_>
<Stary> If I asked everyone here who their favorite Princess is, the leading vote would be Luna am I right? :3
<AJIsAwesome> Probably not.
<thelonepony> ^
<AJIsAwesome> I don't have a favorite princess.
<FlutterMEDIC> ^
<Zuxxez123> Same here.
<Dken2021> I'm more of a Cadance person
<Everlasting_Joy> Cadance for me :).
<Saturn> 08,01i prefer queens.
<Stary> True, not many people would have a favorite Princess...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I like Luna the most.
<Invi> I like evil Celestia, but Luna is the cutest ^^
*Michael has not fav princess
<Zuxxez123> Invi: Yeah, I could agree with that. :3
<LadyCanary> KILLER queens, Saturn? :3
<Meanwhile> Cadence has amused me more than the other two so far.
<Stary> Zuxxez123: Yeah... :)
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: I actually would've preferred Queen Celestia, but I think Lauren's choice was a good decision.
<Zuxxez123> The silence... It's akward...
<MilkyWhiskers> But if Celestia and Luna is Princesses there must be a king and a queen!
<FlutterMEDIC> posting ponies time http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1986/
<Stary> Queen Celestia kind of sounds odd... but it would fit her since she's the eldest and all.
<Saturn> 08,01LadyCanary: changeling queens
<LadyCanary> Ohohoh~
<LadyCanary> Same thing I guess.
<Saturn> 08,01if i had a Chrysalis, she could be any pony princess i wanted.
<Zuxxez123> MilkyWhiskers: Maybe they will have the parents show in the third season.
<Stary> MilkyWhiskers: Fanfiction will fulfill those dreams :)
<MilkyWhiskers> Stary: Eyup.
<Chrysalis> I think some people might have a problem with that
<Invi> Stary, fanfiction already did ^^
<AJIsAwesome> For anyone who doesn't know, Lauren Faust wanted Celestia to have a Queen title, but she considered that the title would sound cold and tyrannical. So she went with Princess Celestia.
<Stary> Invi: Eeyup!
<Stary> Even without the title of Queen, Celestia is still treated like a tyrant in fandom anyways.
<AJIsAwesome> Also, hi LadyCanary :)
<Dken2021> that and queen = evil, princess = good
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: A little backstory, I didn't know that. You are making me a bit more smarter, well played.
<GLaDOS> she still seems cold and tyranical
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Ye the fandom makes jokes about her being a tyrant anyway
<Michael> i cant imagine what type of power can have one upon celestia
<Saturn> 08,01i want to be a pretty pretty princess
<Meanwhile> Alas.
<Michael> or luna
<LadyCanary> But you CAN be Saturn!
<Stary> And Molestia and Trollestia
<FlutterMEDIC> btw, saw the new Princess Cadance toy commercial
<Ponyloverforever> what is this song called?
<Saturn> 08,01Stary: i'd prefer Molestia
<Kandarihu|Birthday> Guess who's birthday it is today!
<GLaDOS> so id say the title didnt make much of a difrence she still seems cold and tyranical, at least in the fanfiction
<AJIsAwesome> Even though I don't have a favorite princess, I prefer Celestia over Luna.
<Invi> Saturn, you are a pretty princess :3 *puts him a tiara on*
<Stary> Saturn: Much more better than the rest I guess.
<Meanwhile> Kandarihu|Birthday: The Queen's mother?
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu|Birthday: mine?o.o
<Kandarihu|Birthday> Mine
<AJIsAwesome> Happy birthday, Kandarihu|Birthday! :)
*Nittany_Discord 11,01gives Saturn a princess outfit
<GLaDOS> i like luna over celestia
<Everlasting_Joy> Happy birthday Kandarihu|Birthday!
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu|Birthday: oh, well happy birthday then! :D
<Stary> Trollestia seems odd anyways, Luna has the better fanbase!
<Michael> Kandarihu|Birthday: happy birthday!
<alexxm> happy birthday Kandarihu|Birthday
<Zuxxez123> Oh my Kandarihu|Birthday happy birthday.
*Princess_Saturn 08,01is now a red and black alicorn
<Stary> Happy birthday Kandarihu!
<FlutterMEDIC> happy birthday Kandarihu|Birthday
*Meanwhile kicks Princess_Saturn in the teeth.
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01i'm celestia's cousin
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Saturn is a bad OC now?
<AJIsAwesome> Princess_Saturn: :D
<Michael> lawl
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01and i move the planets
<AJIsAwesome> NO.
<Invi> cool
<AJIsAwesome> PLEASE STOP.
<MilkyWhiskers> Happy BirthDay Kandarihu|Birthday! ;)
<LadyCanary> Oh, Princess_Saturn, I have a music exam tomorrow @_@
<Stary> Princess_Saturn: We would have many questions if you were Celestia's niece or nephew.
<thelonepony> Happy Birthday Kandarihu|Birthday :)
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01only i can save equestria by sleeping with all of the mane 6
<Stary> XD
<Michael> wut
<thelonepony> :D
<GLaDOS> princess Celestia/Molestia/Trollestia seems cold and tyranical to me anyway even if she doesnt have a queen title
<Zuxxez123> Princess_Saturn: Oh my...
<FlutterMEDIC> 6_9
<Stary> GLaDOS: Yea me too.
<Everlasting_Joy> Princess_Saturn: . . . What?
<AJIsAwesome> GLaDOS: I can see that.
<Alchemist> dammit for about 4-5 times have I entered my A and b movie choices to find out just now they awerent eligible :[
<GLaDOS> though alo of that opinion is based on the way shes portrayed in fanfiction shes a total ass to humans
<Stary> Princess_Saturn: Isn't that Molestia's job? :P
<Invi> Princess_Saturn, at once? :D
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01Stary: sssh! i'm actually Molestia
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01and a changeling
<MilkyWhiskers> >_> <_<
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Everlasting_Joy> Princess_Saturn: Oh! Well o.k. than.
<DashWithRainbows> prince-dari Actually, you're Scottish Molestia.
<Stary> Princess_Saturn: Okie, Dokie, Lokie!
<Zuxxez123> Alchemist: That's a shame, what movies were they?
<MilkyWhiskers> <_< >_>
<thelonepony> :D
<Chrysalis> oh prince-dari
<Chrysalis> Princess_Saturn*
<MilkyWhiskers> :S
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01so that was Clear Skies 1
<Everlasting_Joy> prince-dari getting mixed up with Princess_Saturn :D.
<DashWithRainbows> I meant Princess_Saturn.
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01who would like to see the next one?
<Meanwhile> Does their acting improve in Clear Skies 2?
<DashWithRainbows> Then again, I don't really care.
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: it does
<Stary> X3
<thelonepony> I do (
<Meanwhile> Then sure.
<Midnight_Splendor> I want to see the next one.
<Alchemist> Zuxxez123: Man on fire was the A movie (there is a different earlier version of it I wasnt aware of and thats why it was omitted), and Animatrix was the other, which was omitted because its a collection of 4-5 shorts and its not a "coherent" movie.
<Invi> hai thelonepony
<thelonepony> :)*
<thelonepony> hi Invi :3
<Stary> Wow, that was one long video, sweet! :D
<Zuxxez123> Alchemist: Interesting choices; I actually like your choices.

<mentallyeffedguy> guys*
<Alchemist> Zuxxez123: I was wondering if I could replace "The intouchables" with animatrix. Is it considered to be a b movie?
<thelonepony> hi mentallyeffedguy :)
<Stary> Which reminds me... I have to answer History Class homework....
<DerpyMuffins> lol Luna in her teenage years?

*Chrysalis is in all the cutest pics
<Alchemist> Princess_Saturn: thats fine, I just didnt know it wasnt considered to be a movie, and I didnt see the logs from previous ltteries so I couldnt check.
<Stary> DerpyMuffins: Saturn died and made Saturn a Princess!
<Michael> Chrysalis: because Chrysalis is a cute queen
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01who just posted that Chrysalis?

<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/UXZt1.png
<Chrysalis> if eve ever gets sub-system targeting
*kirzstryfe hugs Luna
<Meanwhile> To be honest you're only likely to freak her out with that kind of welcome.
<Panda|Drawing> Meanwhile nope
<DerpyMuffins> Im more of a NMM person than Luna
<Chrysalis> warning: incoming titans
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01Meanwhile: no, it hink that was our Luna; not sure , though
<Meanwhile> I know who it was.
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01she was dialing in from teh Netherlands

<Princess_Saturn> 08,01so, speaking of Luna
<DoctoDoctorWho> srsly, what is a titan and whats so bad about one?
<kirzstryfe> DoctoDoctorWho, Titans are the largest class of ship in Eve, takes a lot of skills and money to get one together
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01you may or may not have heard about this: http://www.indiegogo.com/saveluna
<kirzstryfe> tough ships, lots of weapons, planet-crackers
<Chrysalis> kirzstryfe you also lose some of said skills if you die while piloting one
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01Luna is in a bad state, and we're trying to raise funds to help her
<DoctoDoctorWho> kirzstryfe: so, uber uber superweapon battleship?
<Stary> Princess_Saturn: Really? I heard she had a good rep in the fandom.
<Meanwhile> Wasn't the point of that thing to be quiet about it?
<Barbetos> Sounds familiar.
<LadyCanary> ...Oh sweet jesus XD
<ekips> so exhausting...
<Barbetos> Paper Tongues?
<Chrysalis> when i was
<Barbetos> Yeah
<Chrysalis> a young boy
<Barbetos> Wow
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01even though we've reached the stated goal, we still need more people to donate if you can
<Chrysalis> my farther
<Cadance|Away> I'm contributing right away
<Chrysalis> and thats enough MCR
<Barbetos> I think that is wrong actually...
<Dark_Horst> not the rusty but dependable scrap-ship :(
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01Stary: read the link, it'll explain it better than i can
<Michael> gotta donate moar money
<Alchemist> Princess_Saturn: I think I donated for that, didnt check up on it lately though. Its good to see it reached it's goal.
<Stary> Princess_Saturn: Alright
<Chrysalis> yeah i donated already
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: it's not thoguh; the goal is arbitrary, and only there because a goal had to be input
<Dark_Horst> o, i get it
<Zuxxez123> I would donate if I had money... It is good that the community is helping Luna in her time of need.
<DoctoDoctorWho> kirzstryfe: so, uber uber superweapon battleship?
<GilDash> The goal would be reached when she's better. If she's not better, the goal's not been reached. :S
<Chrysalis> ramming with sheilds still up?
<Chrysalis> fail
<Dark_Horst> he's gonna go independance day on them
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01we still need as many people to help as possible
<Stary> Oh...
<Stary> Poor girl :(
<Alchemist> Princess_Saturn: do we know approximately how much she needs?
<Michael> http://i.imgur.com/IW7jZ.png
<Meanwhile> I wish I had the disposable income to contribute. Alas.
<Dark_Horst> awesome destruction sequence there
<Chrysalis> pop goes the titan
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: as much as possible, really
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01it's to pay for meds and transport to the hospital
<Chrysalis> there goes several hundred dollars of ship
<Alchemist> If she is far from the needed amount I may be able to donate once more in a month.
<Barbetos> hah
<Barbetos> Ironic
<Midnight_Splendor> That couch
<Meanwhile> Spaced.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Im going to assume that is impressive by their standards
<GLaDOS> Space
<Chrysalis> thats a damn badger not a calipso
<Chrysalis> its just a hauler
<Barbetos> space couch is not amused?
<Chrysalis> at least use a logistics ship
<Barbetos> So in eve... do they not have sheilds or something? How could that couch even hit that glass let alone break it.
<Chrysalis> Barbetos there is shield armour and hull
<Barbetos> I mean.. Is taht even really glass?
<Chrysalis> but no shields was convenient for the scene
<Zuxxez123> Chrysalis: It's scary how much you know about Eve... Impressive really.
<Chrysalis> Zuxxez123 i did play for 2 years
<Chrysalis> and only paid for 2 months of that
<ScootaChicken> What in the name of god are we watching on the sream

<Princess_Saturn> 08,01ooooh, you know i love it when you talk... meteorogically...
<AJIsAwesome> .........

<Chrysalis> oh saturn you silly planet
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i *really* must get on with some work now
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Princess_Saturn: I could teach you meteorology if you teach me computer programming. Learn me C# so I can find a decent job. :p
<Kurra> rah
<DoctoDoctorWho> and I've sworn undying loyalty to this guy...
<Meanwhile> We all make mistakes DoctoDoctorWho.
<Chrysalis> :( i have to work in c# next week
<Chrysalis> and cpp
<Chrysalis> and SQL
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01Nittany_Discord: i don't know C#, but i could learn it and teach you. i hear it's similar to Java, but without good memory management
<taoumi> woohoo
<Chrysalis> someone want to redisgn this database for me?
<GilDash> Chrysalis: Could be worse. Could be VBA. -_-
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just learned SQL Chrysalis.
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: what if i told yout Saturn/ Princess_Saturn was dead and the person you see talking is actually my spy?
<DoctoDoctorWho> Meanwhile: its the least I could do, he fixed bronystate 4 me.
<Bronysith> since tomorrow is the 1st of october i shall finally buy doom complete pack and persona 3~
<Chrysalis> Princess_Saturn c# has a good memory system
<Chrysalis> GilDash some of it is vb
<Chrysalis> and others is aspx
<DoctoDoctorWho> Dovah: ha, blasphemy
<Chrysalis> its a horrifically hacked together system
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I've only worked with C, Perl, and Matlab. I've practiced SQL though not for anything important yet.
<AJIsAwesome> >October 1 tomorrow
<AJIsAwesome> >Candy corn time
<Allegr0> alright, brb everypony
<Dovah> Princess_Saturn: You are now a Spy.
<GilDash> Chrysalis: I've got no formal training in it whatsoever. I'm literally making shit up as I go and referencing Google as often as possible. XD

<Chrysalis> there is no standard language
<fluttershyFTW> so what i miss
<Dovah> Well I'm going to go eat Granny Smith.

<sagas> Cleveland: We're Not Detroit!
<Chrysalis> avoid vb/scripts like a plague
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Then I taught myself Perl and Matlab.

<AdamTheDuck> Meanwhile, nah I'm just quietly watching the art while I sip my coffee :3
<Lunar_Brony> I'm taking a break from building a massive and complex Minecraft rail system

<AJIsAwesome> Okay. :D
<kirz|art> which would you fall under for your area
<Zuxxez123> Hello there Iwanabethatguy. :3

<Meanwhile> Polydunami: Oh dear, she alright?
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: That sucks.
<kirz|art> trying to check for known outages
<AJIsAwesome> Polydunami: She feeling better.
<AJIsAwesome> *?
<sonicdude558> What?
<sonicdude558> Your sister a Unicorn?
<Lunar_Brony> Polydunami yikes. She alright?
<thelonepony> Polydunami: is she alright?
<Polydunami> She's better; we thought it was serious so she is at the hospital right now.
<Sir_Slendy> ....
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<sonicdude558> o
<AJIsAwesome> Hope everything goes better.
<sonicdude558> Good
<DerpyMuffins> A fainting spell?
<Zuxxez123> Polydunami: I wish her the best. I'm sure she is in good hands. :3
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: hope she gets well
<Lunar_Brony> DerpyMuffins she passed out
<RaveBrony> Albany I guess.
<sonicdude558> he's trolling u DepyMuffins
<Polydunami> She will, everypony.
<sonicdude558> *derpymuffins
<AJIsAwesome> sonicdude558: How is he trolling? :S
<Polydunami> It's not as serious as we had thought.
<sonicdude558> nah
<sonicdude558> not him
<twilight_sprinkle> Polydunami: what caused it?
<DerpyMuffins> Stress most likely
<Sir_Slendy> ....
<sonicdude558> Polydunami was for a second
<Sir_Slendy> brb
<sonicdude558> Diabeties?
<AJIsAwesome> I've never fainted before. Wonder what that feels like.
<Wrek> 05gona fix that properly later
<sonicdude558> Too much ponies?
<AJIsAwesome> sonicdude558: That's not somehting you joke around with.
<Wrek> 05but it gives a rough of what it'll look
<sonicdude558> ooooooooook
<AJIsAwesome> It looks very nice, Wrek. :)
<RaveBrony> Nice :3
<Polydunami> One of our friends is a piercing artist. She had some kind of a panic reaction to the needle.
<Meanwhile> Still think the expressions should be swapped.
<AJIsAwesome> Ah.
<sonicdude558> oh wow
<sonicdude558> I would be scared too
<Zuxxez123> Wrek: I think it looks great. Would you mind giving me a lesson on how to do that good? :P
<Kimori> Ive still got a speech to finalize x.x
<DerpyMuffins> It looks so lifelike
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek needs to make a "How to use Paint Tool SAI" playlist.
<Polydunami> No worries, however. It's all good.
<AJIsAwesome> It would be very helpful.
<kirz|art> not seeing anything
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome it's kinda like falling asleep, except it's sudden instead of gradual. Scared the crap outta me when I did. One moment I was walking down the hall, the next I was on the couch with a numb face
<AJIsAwesome> I'm considering becoming an artist if college doesn't take over my life.
<sonicdude558> Is Paint Tool as lightweight as Paint.NET?
<kirz|art> but I'd say give them a call to make sure, not everything makes it onto the websites
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: i almost fainted once after blood was taken out of vein, although a doctor sprinkled me with a bit of cold water and i snapped out of it. it sort of goes dark slowly, you feel badly, obviously, and then fall asleep
<RaveBrony> Ill try that, thanks kirz
<AJIsAwesome> Wow. That's very intersting.
<AJIsAwesome> Nice to know. Thanks. :)
<sonicdude558> ouch, twilight_sprinkle
<Queen_Chrysalis> hiya AJ :D
<AJIsAwesome> Hiya, Queen_Chrysalis :D
<twilight_sprinkle> sonicdude558: yeah it wasnt fun, but it couldve been worse
<DerpyMuffins> Sudden sleep, to put it bluntly AJsAwesome
<kirz|art> sorry there's not much we can do, but if it's a few different people on the same network and it's not the router/modem, then it's probably the isp :(
<AJIsAwesome> DerpyMuffins: Wow. That's.....very shocking.
<sonicdude558> What was that
<sonicdude558> anyways
<otakon> I heard a ping
<MirrorImage> sounds like Sumica just connected to wrek's stream
*RaveBrony kicks at the ground
<Cades> fun
<sonicdude558> Why hello, Queen_Chrysalis. Don't turn us into changelings now! :)
<twilight_sprinkle> hoi Queen_Chrysalis
<RaveBrony> What isp do You use?
<otakon> sonicdude558: doesn't work like that you know
<thelonepony> hi Queen_Chrysalis :)
<MirrorImage> unless i'm thinking a different sound when he joins on planetside
<kirz|art> embarq, it's a dsl service

<otakon> ShizukaXVioletVanilla: OTP
<AJIsAwesome> OTP?
<Meanwhile> otakon x the kitchen sink. OTP.
<Lunar_Brony> I almost blacked out by standing up. I was sitting on the couch and then stood up. Everything went black and I felt light-headed, like someone was squeezing my head. I stumbled around, knocked over a few things, and came to a few seconds later. Scary as hell
<Polydunami> One true pairing, AJIsAwesome
<otakon> One True Pairing
<AJIsAwesome> Okay.
<otakon> Meanwhile: no
<Meanwhile> otakon: yeees.

<kirz|art> do you know if the issue is just your house, or if neighbors are having the same issue?
<Lunar_Brony> Bronysith WTF am I listening to?
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: DO you mind linking that one MvM video with Pinkie and the Scout?
<otakon> THAT'S IT!

*otakon slaps AJIsAwesome over in enthusiasm
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/cugSU.jpg
<AJIsAwesome> What's wrong withcupcakes?
<Rainbow_Lunar> Pinkie Pie
<Bronysith> AHAHAHAHAH
<AJIsAwesome> You mean that overrated fic that needs to die?
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome you don't want to knwo
<Zuxxez123> There is nothing wrong with cupcakes. They are great, with just a little dash of rainbow to it. MMmmmm...
<AJIsAwesome> I still eat cupcakes to this day. Cupcakes doesn't scare me one bit.
<RaveBrony> Im not sure. Dont really talk to my neighbors, lol. They change so often (I live in an anpartment).
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: That's the one. Lol. I didn't think it was good either, but it's fun to mess with other people. :3
<DerpyMuffins> I check my cupcakes everytime I eat one now
<Wrek> 05there we go
<Wrek> 05its 2am
<Wrek> 05good night
<Bronysith> what people need to realize is... GORE does not mean SCARY
<Cades> I don't know
<Rainbow_Lunar> Oh sh*t you exorcist
<AJIsAwesome> Night.
<Wrek> 05hope ya liked
<Bronysith> Scary doesnt mean gore
<Cades> I don't think so
<Meanwhile> Night Wrek.
<Zuxxez123> Good night Wrek.
<Polydunami> Good night, Wrek.
<DerpyMuffins> Cya Wrek
<Lunar_Brony> g'night Wrek
<Bronysith> Scary would be psycological
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Wrek!~
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: EXACTLY.
<Bronysith> that makes you shit your pants
<otakon> Wrek: thanks again man, sleep well
<otakon> brb guys
<Kinixys|afkish> Bye Wrek.
<RaveBrony> Plus 'They' use the internet given to them with the apartment. My family has our own router and such.
<Zuxxez123> Cupcakes was more of a Saw kind of scary. And by scary, they mean gory, stupidly gory.
<Meanwhile> At least Cupcakes didn't have SAW's plot, all over the place calling back to things everyone forgot happened.
<Bronysith> cupcakes is not scary
<Bronysith> just gorey as all balls
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Zuxxez123> Bronysith: eeyup.
<AJIsAwesome> And gore doesn't justify as scary, IMO.
<Bronysith> now scary would be Silence of the lambs
<Lunar_Brony> balls aren't gory
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: Amen to that.
<Bronysith> the thought of someone getting into your head....ugh
<kirz|art> most of the time the isp is the same, cable providers in most places have a monopoly
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Rainbow_Lunar> I WILL NOTVE TURNED INTO CUPCAKES
<RaveBrony> Mhhm.
<AJIsAwesome> What?
<kirz|art> like since you have TW, everyone in the building will have TW
<Zuxxez123> Bronysith: THAT is a psycological movie.
<Bronysith> psycological is scary
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Wrek> 05time for porn
<Bronysith> the only way to be scary is psycological
<Polydunami> Psychological, you mean?
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: .......
<Meanwhile> I have sith on ignore, what movie was that?
<Wrek> 05i mean Superbrony64*
<Bronysith> Wrek: gorey ponr?!
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: Silence of The Lammbs.
<AJIsAwesome> *Lambs
<RaveBrony> It could be flash in toop of that too.
<Lunar_Brony> Wrek you have rendered me speechless.
<Meanwhile> Ah, fava beans and chianti.
<kirz|art> could always check with the landlord if you're on good terms, if they even use the internet
<Rainbow_Lunar> NOONE WILL TURN ME INTO CUPCAKES
<twilight_sprinkle> oh that movie wasnt that scary
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The earlier Saws were more psychological. The later ones became torture porn.
<Bronysith> yup
<MirrorImage> Nittany_Discord - isn't that how most gimmicky movie series turn out?
<AJIsAwesome> Rainbow_Lunar: No offense, but are you still going on with this?
<twilight_sprinkle> the human centipede and antichrist are waaaay worse
<Zuxxez123> Meanwhile: High five for reference?
<MirrorImage> the first one is typically good / great, the second is meh, and 3+ are just gimmick porn
<Bronysith> SAW is not scary...to the people who go through those games it would be scary though
<Meanwhile> Zuxxez123: (\
<Zuxxez123> Human Centipede was just a stupid gore movie.

<kirz|art> :3
<otakon> Dark_Horst: mostly because it's a Wii U sequel
<oni_link> otakon: shut it! theyre fun, and thats what matters.

<kirz|art> cool
<CrimsonPhoenix> different enemies altogether

<DashWithRainbows> NOPENOPENOPE
<Meanwhile> So douchebag.
<Dark_Horst> then they asked if the people wpuld have prefered it not coming out at all to it being exclusive. and guess wjhat, people said YEAH! WII DOESNT DESERVE BAJONETTA
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome, do you even want to know?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>.>
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01AJIsAwesome: have you ever lit 1,000 candles at the same time?
<Meanwhile> <3
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01it's pretty cool
<kirz|art> makes sense
<lowfn> prince-dari: That sounds..... dirty.
<sonicdude558> how is it sold out if it's just pre order?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I want dis game :D
<princess|on> i'd spend $50 on a wonderbolt hoodie;)

<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: NO
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but yeah, it was great
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: DO NOT BUY THAT GODDAMN GAME
<CriticKitten> No srsly. I don't even care honestly. You wanna say "every Mario is the same" and "every Zelda is the same", I dun care. I ain't even mad. Because I know a lot of those same kids are going out and buying Medal of Modern Warfare: Halo Edition every single year, so I just laugh at them now.
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01also, candles are good for candleplay... >.>
<prince-dari> >Wii

<otakon> prince-dari: Wii U is actually pretty powerful
<SaxyPretender> 0,14saw part of grand finals
<AdamTheDuck> Is this the part where I ask what candeplay is Princess_Saturn? XD
<sonicandmario85> otakon:if you were a game i wouldnt buy you either
<Lyra`> whats up babe?
<Kandarihu|Birthday> Buytoast, he was proud of how masterfully he cheated, but he doesn't advocate others cheating.
<otakon> prince-dari: capable of 360/Ps3 level of graphics
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02prince-dari: Here's gameplay of it :)
<Meanwhile> Wii U is actually a waste of time money and effort.
<Lyra`> :o
<Lyra`> RAWR!
<flutterchu> i thought everyone here liked the wii u :(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14game's looking neat
<prince-dari> otakon: It could be the most powerful thing in the world, it's still a shitty design
<ASoftFluffyThing> Wait, who's streaming?
<Dken2021> Meanwhile but....screen on the controller D:
<ASoftFluffyThing> I know Wrek was about an hour ago when I was on my phone
<Kimori> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=os5TXyJlEMc
<Meanwhile> Dken2021: Wooooow that's fucking amaaaaazing.
<lowfn> Wii U seems more like a glorified DS to me.
<oni_link> NewSuperBronyU: the new control is gonna take some getting used to for me at least
<Zuxxez123> Playing on the GamePad will be a pain in the ass in my opinion.
<Brony> forza horizon ftw
<Princess_Saturn> 08,01ASoftFluffyThing: so long as you use the right type of candle, it's relatively sage
<Reikim> I have yet to see RD yet, I'll admit.
<ASoftFluffyThing> lowfn, same here
<Zawan> zzzzzz
<Pink3> amen lowfn thats why i want one :)
<princess|on> lowtn: im with u
<prince-dari> >can't hit anything
<AJIsAwesome> I don't mind the Wii U. I honestly couldn't care.
<prince-dari> Lul
<Dark_Horst> i cant get over how it looks like an oversized gameboy advance. then again, i never cared much for consoles
<Reikim> I hear she's either broken, underpowered, or both.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14considering switching main to RD, her offensive pressure looks fun
<Meanwhile> You could theoretically do some cool stuff with this, but they won't, because they're Nintendo.
<princess|on> ima earn my $50 if i wake up befor emy dad :T
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ignore that for now, game's not even finished
<oni_link> lol was that a wii u remote he pulled out to control the dron in the game XD
<ASoftFluffyThing> Princess_Saturn, depends on what the subject is allergic to as well such as certain scents
<Meanwhile> All they'll do is make what they've been making for the past decade.
<Reikim> 'Course.
<MirrorImage> prince-dari - well the game mode is called "Combat Training"
<otakon> oni_link: maybe
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02princess|on: Lol, you can do it :D
<Reikim> I might play her because her movelist is short and easy to remember.
<princess|on> ik :P
<MirrorImage> did he just say they're "introducing" Create-A-Class?
<Meanwhile> Leverage.
<Reikim> Built around outmaneouvring the rest of the cast, if I'm seeing things correctly.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dunno if that move list is finished
<ASoftFluffyThing> And then chat went into Nintendo discussion
<princess|on> sadly i woke up at 5:30 before anyone else on a weekend
<oni_link> I want AC3 for the Wii U
<Lunar_Brony> I'm back . . . CoD . . .
<Dark_Horst> wow.... these guys aim SLOWLY!
<AJIsAwesome> ASoftFluffyThing: IKR? :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14don't see anythng that looks like her flip kick
<Dken2021> ello Lunar_Brony
<CriticKitten> I'm gonna wait until I see what they end up implementing. It's actually a cool design IF you implement it smartly, but....remains to be seen if they'll actually do it, so yeah, holding onto my money for now.
<Meanwhile> Whatever controller you're using, you still wasted your money on a bad game.
<ASoftFluffyThing> AJIsAwesome, Mmmhmmm
<princess|on> cause i had a dusturbing but yet fun dream :U
<prince-dari> >not for novelty
<Dark_Horst> and that, children, is why you play shooters with a mouse
<Reikim> "Flip kick"?
<prince-dari> Suuuuuuuuuuuure
<AJIsAwesome> Dark_Horst: >Implying that they've played this game before

<thelonepony> ^
<Lunar_Brony> AND I CAN'T HAVE IT
<AJIsAwesome> ^^
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: So no games then
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Waheeeeey
<CrimsonPhoenix> I want fatal frame on Wii U
<Dken2021> that gives advantage to the one using the controller
<oni_link> I dont care, Im getting that Wii U darn it! not for COD but for the first party releases (and AC3) I want a new HD Zelda and F-Zero
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I like games that make me happy and not what everypony else thinks of it.
<flutterchu> Meanwhile: but im not a video game ;_;
<Dark_Horst> you just dont play shooters with analog-sticks. that's like wacking a retarded child with a dead cat. you just dont do it
<oni_link> NewSuperBronyU: me too! /)
<Meanwhile> More power to you Super, you still have horrible taste.
<MirrorImage> NewSuperBronyU - agreed. Which is why one of these days i'm going to play Skyrim and give myself all the spells before i'm even out of Helgan
<Dken2021> Dark_Horst I take it you play FPS on PCs?
<Meanwhile> That's looking sweet kirz.
<Lunar_Brony> Who's streaming?
<sonicandmario85> NewSuperBronyU:same
<Dark_Horst> yup. grew up with battlefield
<CriticKitten> I'll wait and see on new Zelda, myself. I ended up getting both TP and SS because they both made some great steps forward. But I sort of expect the next Zelda to take steps backwards now, it's Nintendo's pattern. :.
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back Lunar_Brony, NewSuperBronyU is streaming
<sonicandmario85> SKIP IT!
<CriticKitten> *:/
<ASoftFluffyThing> Lunar_Brony, looks like NewSuperBronyU since all I'mm seeing is WiiU stuffs
<Dken2021> Lunar_Brony I take it superbrony is
<MirrorImage> NewSuperBronyU - skip that add please...

<Lunar_Brony> k thx
<Meanwhile> More sports games. Of course.

<Dark_Horst> that ad makes no sense
*Dken2021 is laying the smackdown
<oni_link> CriticKitten: me too
<CriticKitten> Okay, the sports thing is actually sort of cool.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Lyra`: D:
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, http://derpy.me/qfOct XD

<CriticKitten> I could see you playing Madden, using the touchpad as a playbook.
<oni_link> dat kart racing :3
<Lunar_Brony> Winner wasn't even in the room
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb6weuBSAP1rxzaoho1_1280.png dang it Pumpkin cake is such a bitch
<Kencolt> You can play as a caddy. That's... actually, kind of brilliant.
<Lunar_Brony> I find that amusing
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ah
<AJIsAwesome> I don't have an opinion on the Wii U yet. I'll wait to see how they'll implement the control scheme for games, then I'll make one.
<Dark_Horst> i'm still waiting for the day someone makes a cross-platform shooter that actually pitches consoles vs PCs
<Wrek> 05gotta love yahtzee AdamTheDuck :D
<Meanwhile> Ok so basically what this advert is for is to remind you that they do not in fact have original ideas in Nintendo
<Dark_Horst> that would settle this age old conflict once and for all^^
<Wrek> 05which vid was that from now again?
<Dark_Horst> with global scores
<shiningdawn> this is what i think of the wii:|
<kirz|art> not the same pony, just to get a sense of the difference :P
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Originality is dead.
<CrimsonPhoenix> PC is still better for FPS
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Sadly.
<CriticKitten> May as well give up on it.
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix I imagine their voices are like phil and lil
<Reikim> EVOLUTION
<superretroworld> go nintendo style
<CriticKitten> The proof of that? Sony All Stars.
<oni_link> Dark_Horst: kinda like shadowrun?
<AdamTheDuck> Wrek, can't remember, it's been a while since I watched anything from him :/
<Wrek> 05fps works so well on PC due to the accurate controls
<Pink3> lol
<Reikim> Almost makes me want to draw more.
<Reikim> Aaaaaaalmost
<Wrek> 05you dont need to have aim assist to have a chance at snipign someones head
<kirz|art> lol
<Lunar_Brony> ^
<Dark_Horst> oni_link: thought that was a bookseries
<Cades> lol
<prince-dari> You don't need aim assist with dual analog either
<CriticKitten> "Hey guys, we herd u lyke SSB, so we gun make a shitty ripoff with a terrible roster so we can steal your money lul"
<Reikim> For the moment though, my current goal is to finish this first chapter of the TWIGROPE SAGA
<Lunar_Brony> that is why TF2 will never succeed on consoles
<Wrek> 05if consoles could provide that kind of control over ones char, i wouldnt mind fps on consoles as much
<Reikim> And then send it off to otakon.
<kirz|art> hey Saxy, remember this one? http://kirzstryfe.deviantart.com/art/Pony-Bag-269279824?q=gallery%3Akirzstryfe%2F2104168&qo=28
<kirz|art> I'm sure Shizuka does
<prince-dari> Mouse usually has lower top sensitivity than dual analog IMO
<CrimsonPhoenix> I want a joystick for movement in PC
<Dken2021> CriticKitten but.....they have combos D:
<Shizuka> 13<3
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: stick a mouse in an usb port
<otakon> prince-dari: yes yes you do but it's usually too damn much
<Meanwhile> That looks...creepy.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14hehe, I do
<prince-dari> Well I always play top sensitivity on FPS games
<Reikim> > lewd connotations
<kirz|art> was a crazy night Meanwhile :)
<Meanwhile> Like that one creepy pasta with the handbag doll.
<prince-dari> On PC or console, and it's never 'too fast'
<otakon> prince-dari: that's why for you
<oni_link> Lunar_Brony: it hasnt, lobbys are dead. no hats, or weapons, or sprays or anything. its a vanilla TF2 with no plans to change it.
<Lunar_Brony> oni_link O______O
<otakon> prince-dari: are you kidding? I've tryed top settings and I can't even tell what the hell I'm doing
<Lunar_Brony> PC FTW
<Lunar_Brony> screw 360
<prince-dari> otakon: Then you don't play enough
<Wrek> 05when scoped i have very low sensitivity, otehrwise i got high sensitivity so i can actualyl turn aroudn before i die when shot in the back
<oni_link> Lunar_Brony: I own the Orange Box on 360, never again.
<otakon> prince-dari: I play plenty
<prince-dari> You get used to it after a little time

<Reikim> Hooray for VG butthurt in mane.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Problem is, Microsoft and Valve may never settle their differences about DLC policies.

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Lunar_Brony: 49 days \:3/
<Lunar_Brony> AND I CAN'T HAVE IT
<Lunar_Brony> cuz I'm broke

<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, I'm staying out of that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01At least for TF2.
<Reikim> You'd get flattened.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01With L4D2, Valve had to charge for the DLC.
<CriticKitten> Honestly, the console is cool. But the question remains whether or not it'll be used well. *shrug* I'm holding out until I know for sure.
<oni_link> Nittany_Discord: Thats microsoft for ya. >.>

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I saw Halo4 SP footage, and I wasn't really impressed by it.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim internet is not compatible with otanet
<prince-dari> >have your own real eastate on your gamepad
<Meanwhile> A plague upon it's house.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14yeah, yeah, repetative and shit
<otakon> GIVE US ANIMAL CROSSING!
<kirz|art> I hold 12yo's responsible for that Meanwhile
<prince-dari> What is this bullshit he is speaking?
<Queen_Chrysalis> bbboooooooooo wiiU
<oni_link> otakon: they released it on steam :o
<otakon> mario chase?
<otakon> really?
<Meanwhile> Twelve year olds aren't the ones who built it.
<otakon> REALLY!?
<Dark_Horst> and who the fuck is supposed to buy that?
<Reikim> I hold idiot consumers and the publishers that feed them responsible.
<RoboGerbil> wy did they call it wi u when they havnt named any of their consoles after another.. ever
<kirz|art> but they're the ones shelling out the money and bitching about it
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Meanwhile i hold CoD
<otakon> FUCKING REALLY!? INSTEAD OF GO KARTS YOU GET TO RUN AFTER EVERYBODY
<Dark_Horst> that'S the nkind of game people play when there'S mario on the cover
<Dark_Horst> BUT THERE ISNT
<oni_link> otakon: yeah
<otakon> Metroid Blast
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have to blame CoD.
*kirz|art kills the arguement before it hits the "this is why EA is bad" point
<otakon> looks a bit interesting
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<kirz|art> take it to mane :P
<Meanwhile> Health regen, space marines, the desire to tack on multiplayer, ironsights.
<otakon> oh
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm done with EA hate forever. It does no good.
<Lyra`> was taht?
<otakon> it's ALL mini games
<kirz|art> -.-
<Lyra`> WAS THAT!?!!?!
<oni_link> otakon: search for Strangers Wrath HD
<otakon> it's a mini game Game
<oni_link> on steam
<Lyra`> PIKMIN 3?!?!
<otakon> oni_link: yeah I know
<Dark_Horst> nintendo land. we can watch that get moldy in the shelves
<SaxyPretender> 0,14okay, minor nitpick, but Halo doesn't have ironsights
<Lunar_Brony> Lyra` eeyup
<otakon> Lyra`: no that was mini game pikmin
<Lyra`> ._.
<Lunar_Brony> oh
<otakon> OH FUCK YOU!
<Reikim> My personal favourite is the whole "add multiplayer to it" trend.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's just because that's what sells Meanwhile.
<Lunar_Brony> nevermind
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> SaxyPretender yet
<otakon> Wii U EXCLUSIVE weapon
<prince-dari> Oh, fuck everything.
<Meanwhile> No, it's because that's what sold.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Lyra`: Oh yeah, they announced Pikmin 3 :)
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Wasn't MArio Party a mini game game?
<CriticKitten> Dark_Horst: Er, you do realize that the Wii's top selling game was Wii Sports, right?
<otakon> WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN MAPS!
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02I'll show the trailer after this ;3
<Reikim> Also health regen was, I believe, pioneered by CoD.
<otakon> FUCK YOU EA YOU FUCKING BASTARDS!
<Yahooz> d-d-d-double kick
<otakon> WE SHOULD HAVE HAD MAPS! AND RADAR!
<AdamTheDuck> (You sent 7 messages in 10 seconds.) otakon XD
<CriticKitten> And that's top selling, as in "people actually bought the game individually, not counting bundle sales"
<Dark_Horst> CriticKitten: welp, mankind is fucked
<Meanwhile> If Halo hadn't done as well as it did then those wouldn't have become the staple.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> http://lolpics.se/pics/7735.jpg
<Meanwhile> And we wouldn't be where we are.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02YEAH FUCK THEM FOR BRINGING GAMES TO OTHER CONSOLES, HOW DARE THEY
<Dark_Horst> but this here has to be a joke
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I do hate forced MP, but people sometimes complain when it's not there.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14man, there's so much butthurt in here
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: IKR? :S
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's like everyone sat on tacks
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's delicious
<oni_link> I wanna try NintendoLand
<Shizuka> 13yep... not going to bother streaming tonight..
<kirz|art> lol TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: no fuck them for taking shit out of the game that was done in the original and then PUTTING IT BACK IN afterwards ON A PORT
<Reikim> Because nobody is capable of enjoying a good single-player campaign anymore.
<CriticKitten> Shizu: D:
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and those tacks were covered in lemon juice and salt
<kirz|art> ^
<otakon> ME1 had maps
<otakon> and radar
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Reikim talk to yourself
<Meanwhile> ^^
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And MP lets some publishers attach online passes (oh joy! </sarcasm>)
<Reikim> Everything is about multiplayer now.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and that salt came from babies punched in the face
<oni_link> Shizuka: how come?
<otakon> ME2 and ME3 did NOT
<Reikim> Whuzzat Trix?
<CrimsonPhoenix> ME3 is weak anyway
<AdamTheDuck> Shizuka, you're not going to stream any glorious music today? :<
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: With a little bit of rust on the nails, too.
<Shizuka> 13nope
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i enjoy singleplayer over MP
<otakon> CrimsonPhoenix: true but still it's a slap in the face
<DerpyMuffins> Never though I see ME3 on the Wii
<Meanwhile> Oh well.
<Shizuka> 13even had something special
<SaxyPretender> 0,14A /little/ bit of rust?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14pfft
<Lunar_Brony> aww damn
<Shizuka> 13but there's too much complaining
<AdamTheDuck> That's a pitty...
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Pikmin 3 \:3/
<CriticKitten> ;-;
<Lunar_Brony> I blame otakon
<oni_link> shizuka pls :<
<Wrek> 05tell me about it shizu
<otakon> Shizuka: no no PLEASE stream it's just me about the superior Wii U port of ME3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> my gaming list says so
<kirz|art> I agree with TheGreatAndPowerfulT, it's much nicer to have a solo jerk than a circle jerk
<Reikim> You know what I was saying applied only to a general representation of the popular gaming world today.
<kirz|art> >.>
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Just game chat Shizuka. Gaming chat is ripe with complaining.
<Meanwhile> More Pikmin. Wooo. sarcastic face.
<otakon> Shizuka: it's JUST me please stream ;_;
<Kencolt> Shizuka: I think it would be okay if it's not more gaming stuff.
<Wrek> 05theres always a few that jsut cant stop whining about the free content :|
*AJIsAwesome is sitting back, enjoying the butthurt.
<sonicdude558> Yay this game
<Lyra`> <3
<Lyra`> <3 <3 <3
<Zuxxez123> This game; one of the biggest reasons I am getting WiiU.
<Lyra`> so much WUB!
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: nah, turn in early. save yourself the trouble.
<Dark_Horst> the one thingi really minded about ME3 was the ending.... gameplay.... well, they kinda blunted it a lot
<Lyra`> rock men?!?!
<Lunar_Brony> yeah
<Lunar_Brony> rock pikmin
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but yeah, what I mean to say is that there's a whole lot of kvetching
<Dark_Horst> like, really, BLUNTED it.... but it worked
<Reikim> Trix, is that MvM still going?
<CrimsonPhoenix> SaxyPretender, kvetching?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> haven't started only you responded
<kirz|art> whining, bitching, etc
<otakon> Wrek: it's not about free content it's having a working map and radar in a game that was taken out originally then put back in afterwards. It's like buying a car and then going back and finding out just after you bought that car a better version came out for the exact same price the next day.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Kvetching is Yid-
<AJIsAwesome> It means bitching.
<sonicdude558> rock music
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dammit, kirz
<Reikim> So anyone else willing to get in on this?
<oni_link> Damn multiple dudes controlling the pikmin
<AJIsAwesome> YES
<Dark_Horst> SaxyPretender: welp, i learned a new word today
<Meanwhile> Eh, maybe.
<AJIsAwesome> Can't wait for this game.
<otakon> That's all I was raging about on ME3
<RoboGerbil> so why are we just watching youtubes?
<kirz|art> ninja :3
<otakon> RoboGerbil: bc we are
<RoboGerbil> like we cant watch youtubes on our own?
<AJIsAwesome> RoboGerbil: Because.
<Reikim> Actually I should go bug otakon.
<AdamTheDuck> RoboGerbil, because Wii U
<CrimsonPhoenix> This game is art
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Reikim> otakon. MvM?
<otakon> NewSuperBronyU: can you show the Black Betty one please?
<Obsidian> Finally made it back
<otakon> Reikim: to play atm? no thanks
<Reikim> Mebbe Shizu.

<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Good game
<sonicdude558> o
<AdamTheDuck> sonicdude558, Good game
<sonicdude558> I must learn more text language
<AdamTheDuck> To show a bit of good sportsmanship as you will
<sonicdude558> i guessh
<therainbowvortex> hey whats the game???
<Derpy_Hooves> this fucking stage!
<Dken2021> sonicdude558 sit with the girls with their phones open all the time, you'll learn alot
<AdamTheDuck> therainbowvortex, Super Smash Brothers Brawl
<Zuxxez123> Yup, if only people would be more like 'GG' and not 'WTF YOU PRICK!' anymore...
<sonicdude558> Ladies?
<sonicdude558> Like Tara Strong? :trollface:
<RaveBrony> Back
<AdamTheDuck> Tara Strong is best Twilight
<Dken2021> yea, sure, you're cool, whatever
<oni_link> Zuxxez123: Tf2 gamers are like that most the time
<RaveBrony> kirz|art: Love the art :o what program do you use??
<AJIsAwesome> Or calling hax.
<CrimsonPhoenix> fun fact
<oni_link> lol
<AJIsAwesome> >Sniping someone? Hax.
<CrimsonPhoenix> GG can be seen as an insult in some games
<kirz|art> sai
<sonicdude558> "Grandma's a wig", "Finish our homework" What?
<RaveBrony> Damn.... everyone has sai....
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: really, which ones?
<RaveBrony> I need it
<AJIsAwesome> >Shooting someone near the middle/lower body? Noob
<kirz|art> you can find a free version
<Zuxxez123> oni_link: Yeah, I'm aware. At least on RTS games (Starcraft 2 is my instance) people normally say GG or GL-HF(Good Luck Have Fun) before the game.
<CrimsonPhoenix> League of Legends mainly
<RaveBrony> I already used the trial :D
<DerpyMuffins> Is it wrong that Im rooting for Derpy to win?
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: What would GG mean in that game?
<twilight_sprinkle> dota 2 came out yesterday btw
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: lol yeah, you dont go for headshots, youre a noob apparantly
<kirz|art> there's another spot with the free one
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's Good game
<Zuxxez123> DerpyMuffins: No, I am doing the same. :P
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: IKR, :S
<otakon> welp guys I hate to say it
<oni_link> Zuxxez123: ti would enjoy that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but League of Legends is like torture if you're losing
<otakon> I gotta go I'm being forced off my PC
<oni_link> *i
<RaveBrony> O.o
<AdamTheDuck> bbl, playing tf2 :P
<sonicdude558> I will be forced off pc soon
<sonicdude558> :(
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Poll Results: What Kind of Pony Merch Do You Own?
<Dken2021> take care otakon
<otakon> bc apparently there is so much to do beside watch tv and be here
<oni_link> that sucks bye otakon
<otakon> bye guys take care
<twilight_sprinkle> CrimsonPhoenix: LoL, HoN, DoTa- theyre all torture for players who arent good, the communities are very douchy
<superretroworld> bye otakon
<AJIsAwesome> bye, otakon :)
<twilight_sprinkle> bye otakon
<DerpyMuffins> Go Derpy GO!
<Kinixys|afk> Bye ota
<DerpyMuffins> Cya otakon
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, exactly
<Reikim> There are places you can find the free version.
<Reikim> Also: otanet SUCKS.
<CrimsonPhoenix> except LoL are prebubescent morons who THINKS they're good
<therainbowvortex> my life was empty then i met ponys and then seesion 2 ended now im empty again
<RaveBrony> :\
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02gg :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> actually...same goes for HoN
<Reikim> Time to go try and fix that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dota MAYBE less
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Last match :D
<twilight_sprinkle> if you play on russian dota servers, everyone knows your mother
<superretroworld> therainbowvortex: you wont be empty for long
<RaveBrony> But 'free' do you mean pirated? :I
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: lol wut
<AJIsAwesome> Meh. I actually managed to get interested in other shows and series ever since Season 2 ended.
<Reikim> No.
<twilight_sprinkle> oni_link: their insults always involve it :P
<RaveBrony> Oh cool, is it on the site?
<therainbowvortex> twilight_sprinkle: what what the hell are you talking about
<Reikim> I mean illicitly gained through semi-shady means that skirt the borders of illegality and are largely untraceable by the authorities.
<Dken2021> I've been watching breaking bad from start to end of season 3 right now
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: lol oh yeah, same for kids on COD (for consoles at least)
<RaveBrony> Lol.....
<RaveBrony> Id like to legit have it :D
<sonicdude558> I do not care for COD
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: Ive been watching Dr. Who :P I love it. CGI is still a little cheesy for me but I love the show as a whole
<Reikim> Look at it like Photoshop.
<AJIsAwesome> I've yet to watch Breaking Bad.
<AJIsAwesome> I hear it's really good.
<CrimsonPhoenix> therainbowvortex, if you feel empty because of the lack of NEW pony episode then you need to re-evaluate your life
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: everyone tells me to watch that show too XD
<Reikim> Who do you think actually buys that for six hundred dollars?
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: Same here, it's on Netflix if you have that.
<RaveBrony> If i wasnt worried about pirating, I would have Photoshop and be making a desktop pony for myself.
<Reikim> You don't need Photoshop :/
<AJIsAwesome> OKay. Thanks. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> therainbowvortex: their insults always involve saying something about doing something to your mother is what im trying to say in a subtle way...
<otakon> this sucks I wanted to see Shizuka stream
<twilight_sprinkle> wow charizard sucks
<Reikim> Personally, I use GraphicsGale for spriting. Hell, it's practically built for it.
<therainbowvortex> oh lol
<Dken2021> oh yea, it has Bryan Cranston, which I never though he do a serious role since he was Hal on malcolm in the middle
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: If you don't know how to use him.
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02gg :)
<twilight_sprinkle> wow
<sonicdude558> what a delay
<CrimsonPhoenix> lolwat
<Reikim> Build a spritesheet, port into some sort of GIF creator, PROFIT
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I was brutally destroyed by someone using Hcarizard.
<AJIsAwesome> *Charizard
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: eh, ive never played that game tbh
<CrimsonPhoenix> needs more fox
<CrimsonPhoenix> and less items
<Reikim> Photoshop is really overkill if you're just making a desktop pony.
<Derpy_Hooves> that fucking wario map always ruins the session for me
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Oh, okay. You're not really missing out.
<Dken2021> and now, darkness
<sonicdude558> good stream
<Reikim> And if you really want a good, free Photoshopp clone, look no further than GIMP.
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: really? looks kinda fun, minus the imbalanced characters
<CrimsonPhoenix> twilight_sprinkle, that's the point
<sonicdude558> The buffer show
<Dken2021> where's kingdom hearts when you need it?
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's no balance for a reason
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I guess. It's more online battles than anything for me.
<sonicdude558> Wheres Tara Strong when you need her?
<CrimsonPhoenix> it insult the tourney aspect of the game
<sonicdude558> :3
<therainbowvortex> CrimsonPhoenix: wait a sec hat was an insalt
<CrimsonPhoenix> Brawl?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Yes
<Reikim> Photoshop is for...well, shopping photos, and high-end digital artwork.
<RaveBrony> Meh. Do to what ive seen, i desperately want SAI
<CrimsonPhoenix> Broken character
<CrimsonPhoenix> Tripping
<Reikim> *Due
<CrimsonPhoenix> items
<CrimsonPhoenix> hazards
<RaveBrony> Lol
<Reikim> Torrents are magic.
<RaveBrony> Just about to fix that, but thanks :P
<princess|on> nnn brb
<Zuxxez123> Is someone really going to defend that SSB is a perfect series with no flaws?
<AJIsAwesome> I still like the game, not as much as Melee or Smash.
<Lyra`> i will :3
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Oh, no.
<AJIsAwesome> It's got flaws.
<Dken2021> brawl can be competive, if you use Brawl+
<Dken2021> or vanilla
<AJIsAwesome> I usually go back to Brawl for online matches.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dken2021, lolbrawl+
<AJIsAwesome> Either than that, nothing else.
<sonicdude558> I have never herd of this "Brawl+", what is it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Dken2021, what's Vanilla?
<thelonepony> Supermeatboy :3
<RedDragonX> lol Kjakings
<Dken2021> CrimsonPhoenix just the basic game
<CrimsonPhoenix> with items?
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: stock
<CrimsonPhoenix> and level hazards?
<CrimsonPhoenix> also no sound
<Cades> haha
<CrimsonPhoenix> to streamer
<oni_link> Dken2021: I cant find a good ISO for brawl+
<RedDragonX> can't believe that sick bastard isn't in jail yet
<twilight_sprinkle> i have sound
<oni_link> so im on vanilla
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02There is sound though o.o
<oni_link> I hear it NewSuperBronyU
<Lyra`> i have sound
<sonicdude558> I have sound too
<thelonepony> i have sound
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh wow
<Zuxxez123> Sound is a go. :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's very low
<Dken2021> sonicdude558, it's a mod for brawl, changing codes so it feels more like melee
<sonicdude558> ok
<RaveBrony> The only thing i have torrented is the 'Derpy' version of 'The Last Roundup'
<princess|on> bk
<sonicdude558> burger king
<AJIsAwesome> Dat Castlevania Reference.
<CrimsonPhoenix> even melee shouldn't have been tourney
<RaveBrony> My friend legit bought me the rest of the seasons :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause let's be honest
<kirz|art> I plan on buying the set when it hits dvd
<CrimsonPhoenix> what did you need to remove to actually make it competitive?
<AJIsAwesome> Melee isn't the perfect game, but I prefer it over the first and Brawl.
<RaveBrony> So was I, lol.
<superretroworld> i still think the original is perfect
<RaveBrony> But my friend bet me he wouldnt get addicted to mlp if he watched the first 3 eps :D
<Lunar_Brony> I'm back. How much did I miss?
<sonicdude558> er
<sonicdude558> you missed Brawl
<thelonepony> not that much
<superretroworld> Lunar_Brony: wb, not much
<Zuxxez123> Competive SSB game would have to remove all items probably.
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: me too! Although i didnt like the dash glitches
<CriticKitten> >competitive
<CriticKitten> >SSB
<oni_link> CriticKitten: its a thing, yes
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: True.
<RaveBrony> He lost, so I wasnt going to turn down the episodes :D
<CriticKitten> Sort of missing the point. :P
<AJIsAwesome> Although I LOVE powershielding in that game.
<AJIsAwesome> In fact, it was the CPU's that taught me it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Zuxxez123, exactly
<quicksilver52170> ello :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> removing half of the game to make it competitive
<Polydunami> It makes just as much sense if you substitute SSB with video games, CriticKitten.
<thelonepony> hi quicksilver52170
<quicksilver52170> :3
<Cades> XD
<Dken2021> rllo quicksilver52170
<princess|on> hi quick >:P
<quicksilver52170> :P
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, quicksilver52170 :)
<princess|on> ik him hes on my game on roleblox guys :3
<Polydunami> Anyway, I need to take a nap. Later
<Lunar_Brony> hi quicksilver52170
<quicksilver52170> ohai
<RaveBrony> aaaaand my vids and such still dont work :(
<quicksilver52170> :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> Street Fighter is a good and way better game for competitive
<Lunar_Brony> g'night poly
<Lunar_Brony> gah
<RedDragonX> yeah don't bother asking him questions lol he wont answe ryou
<princess|on> stalking me eh silver? >:3
*RaveBrony flips a table
<RedDragonX> if you see him again anyways
<quicksilver52170> oyusiam
<quicksilver52170> :3
<twilight_sprinkle> this game makes me want to rage just looking at it
<quicksilver52170> y?=/
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I can see that. :D
<Rustymeat> oh hey is NewSuperBronyU still playing?
<AJIsAwesome> Yep
<Dken2021> mmhmm
<princess|on> you know how to respond to ppl silver?
<princess|on> like this
<quicksilver52170> =/
<Cades> haha I'll keep that in mind
<princess|on> quicksilver52170: hi :3
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I actually saw someone do a drunk attempt at this game. :D
<quicksilver52170> LOL
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: lol live?
<quicksilver52170> XD
<RedDragonX> he's a very...strange breed of internet troll
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: its just preference. SSB is a different type of fighter but it still has lots of competetions, its actually not as niche as you'd think
<quicksilver52170> ssb?
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, it's a horrible game for competition
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's a party game
<quicksilver52170> stop giving me nostalgia from my childhood =/
<CrimsonPhoenix> even SAKURAI HIMSELF said that
<Mozdoc> What on earth is this game and what is that thing swimming around in the sludge?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:D
<quicksilver52170> anyone have a youtube?:P
<Meanwhile> Would appear to be a giant blood clot.
<twilight_sprinkle> that was a close one
<princess|on> i should get dat on here but insted you used your so called AXE banned him somehow:[
<superretroworld> quicksilver52170: never heard of it
<CrimsonPhoenix> Mozdoc, it's Super Meat Boy
<Rustymeat> poor meat blob :(
<quicksilver52170> never heard of youtube?D:
<Dken2021> oh god, natural light!
<CrimsonPhoenix> a sadistic plate-former
<superretroworld> quicksilver52170: sarcasm xD
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:D
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: Okay if he said that thats fine. But it still doesnt stop people from competing in it. It just goes to show how much people like it. If you make tourneys, they will come
<quicksilver52170> who has never heard of youtube :D
<Rustymeat> :)
<thelonepony> so cute :3
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Nope. Recorded. But it was hilarious. :D
<AJIsAwesome> Super Smash Brothers.
*TheGreatAndPowerfulT will buy it if it comes with enlgish lenguage option
<CrimsonPhoenix> I still find SSBB tourneys to be horrible
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: is it on youtube?
<Dken2021> how does one even beta test this game?
<Cypresswolf> What...did I come back to this time O_o
<superretroworld> quicksilver52170: elders maybe
<Kurra> tsoboe no tsetsya dalshe...
<CrimsonPhoenix> they ain't even playing the actual game on how it's meant to be played
<oni_link> Cypresswolf: super meat boy
<Meanwhile> Welp, that about does it for me. Need some sleep.
<CrimsonPhoenix> because of how broken it is
<Cades> he seemed a little weird the first time i met him :p
<Meanwhile> Night everyone.
<Cypresswolf> that was creepy
<Lunar_Brony> g'night Meanwhile
<thelonepony> night Meanwhile
<princess|on> silver you should really come on friday the last movie was epic
<Dken2021> seeya Meanwhile
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: how so?
<superretroworld> night Meanwhile
<quicksilver52170> CHAPTER COMPLETE!:D
<AJIsAwesome_> Night, Mea- gone.
<quicksilver52170> derp
<kirz|art> back to art
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, Meta-Knight, odds
<SaxyPretender> 0,14work them magics
<CrimsonPhoenix> you don't play with odds in a competition game
<princess|on> you guys know in a trailer theres a new Dc universe comeing out in 2014
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's meant to measure the player
<CriticKitten> Oh no, I can understand people wanting to compete in a game.
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: yeah, you dont. hes OP same goes for several other characters, they were tailored for casuals.
<CriticKitten> But there are different forms of competition. Expecting a solid tournament fighter out of your party game is missing the point.
<Kurra> is that.... salt? o.o
<oni_link> Kurra: yeah
<quicksilver52170> .__.
<Lunar_Brony> Kurra IKR?
<Kurra> o-oh... myy~
<Cypresswolf> :) Ah, I love finishing off the last of the whiskey - strong enough for a slight hangover in the morning
<quicksilver52170> im getting the small feeling that sombodys gonna start a 4chan thread like conversation
<princess|on> Kurra yup its also DEATH SODUIM liek soduim can kill us in real life
<quicksilver52170> =/
<oni_link> quicksilver52170: they were eariler XD
<princess|on> soduim is basicly this acid and flooride i guess
<quicksilver52170> oh god
<quicksilver52170> >Not being 4chan
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, see even you admit it's broken
<quicksilver52170> >4channers invade
<CCCP> :o this game!
<quicksilver52170> >derp
<quicksilver52170> LOL
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: Never said it wasn't
<oni_link> no game is to be honest
<quicksilver52170> he just ran head fisrt into salt :P
<princess|on> guess what quicksilver52170
<quicksilver52170> WHAT
<CrimsonPhoenix> then why can't meta-kknight be in the game?
<OneTrickPony> is SB64 still streaming?
<princess|on> i exploded u XD
<CrimsonPhoenix> in the tourney even
<thelonepony> eeyup
<Lunar_Brony> I think so
<Kurra> do not want 4chan here, thankyou
<Zuxxez123> OneTrickPony: He is, yes.
<CCCP> derp?
<oni_link> i think he was mis interperted. he was making fun of the 4channers
<superretroworld> was anybody scared of big mac in ponyville confedential?
<AJIsAwesome_> Nope.
<OneTrickPony> this game is insane
<AJIsAwesome_> Just shocked.
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: he can just not in tourneys.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, why not
<CrimsonPhoenix> he's in the game
<CrimsonPhoenix> so are items
<CrimsonPhoenix> why can't they be in tourneys?
<Kurra> oni_link, i don't care either way whoever was kidding, I just make blanket statement.
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: his moveset is broken. Items get in the way of the competetion.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, but those are in the game
<Rustymeat> This level sucks
<CrimsonPhoenix> removing them doesn't make you play the game on how it's intend to be
<Lunar_Brony> certainly looks challenging
<CrimsonPhoenix> you're playing a different game instead
<Rustymeat> nice
<AJIsAwesome_> It doesn't suck. It's just difficult.
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: Well yeah, youre playing with rules. Rules make the game.
<oni_link> Tournaments have rules.
<Zuxxez123> Gotta restart for updates there?
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, nothing in Super Street Fighter 4 is removed
<CrimsonPhoenix> and the FULL game is in the tourney
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: but not all tournaments are the same.
<AJIsAwesome_> Well, that wasn't hard.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, I'm just saying
<CrimsonPhoenix> SSBB is dumb to play in tourney
<Dken2021> what's your view on competitive pokemon battling?
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: I see your points but people are gonna do what they want. *shrug*
<CrimsonPhoenix> you're not even playing the full thing
<AJIsAwesome_> I don't mind competitive pokemon battles. It's not my thing, though
<Lunar_Brony> >reach top of level
<Lunar_Brony> >die
<CrimsonPhoenix> pokemon is a whole other thing
<CCCP> i hope i dont ebola :s
<Zuxxez123> Yeah, I don't play PokeMon to be competetive, I play to relax. :3
<CCCP> get*
<Rustymeat> There are far worse things in this game
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Agreed.
<Kurra> there are far worse things in life, period.
<Rustymeat> If he gets there I would like to see NewSuperBronyU get to the bandage girl levels
<AJIsAwesome> I don't play Pokemon for EVs, IVs, Natures, or Abilities. I play it because I enjoy it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, don't get me wrong I did enjoy SSBB
<Zuxxez123> I really don't play ANY game competively yet. Maybe try TF2 Professionally but I doubt that will last long.
<CrimsonPhoenix> but I just play it for the heck of it
<SadSaturn> 08,01hm
<CrimsonPhoenix> heck I put Brawl - in it
<AJIsAwesome> SadSaturn: Why are you so sad?
<CCCP> SadSaturn y u sad?
<sonicandmario85> SadSaturn:Y U SAD?
<Lunar_Brony> hi SadSaturn. Why are you sad?
<TheBadger> It's amazing that people still play pokemon a decade after the last games came out
<SadSaturn> 08,01i don't know
<Rustymeat> Lets put a smile on that face
<twilight_sprinkle> lol
<SadSaturn> 08,01i'm just... bleh
<RedDragonX> yep
<Lunar_Brony> I know that feel bro
<OneTrickPony> SadSaturn: smile smile smile
<AJIsAwesome> SadSaturn: I seriously know how you feel.
<CrimsonPhoenix> TheBadger, actually Black and White came out less than a decade
<Zuxxez123> SadSaturn: It's been one of those days for me too.
<AJIsAwesome> I get that ALL the times.
<AJIsAwesome> *time
*Kurra sadface too?
<thelonepony> SadSaturn: i know that feel
<pony_4889> theyre definitly running out of ideas for new pokemon though, an icecream pokemon, really?
<OneTrickPony> dat feel
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: in terms of smash, items and certain characters take away from the competetive aspect. so thats why they do what they do. I know youre saying that the game wasnt meant to be played competetively in the first place but there are hardcore players. and thats what these tourneys cater to.
<CrimsonPhoenix> and I think B&W2 came out recently
<OneTrickPony> dat feel is bad
*Kurra v_v
<Kandarihu|Birthday> Oh how I wish I could watch this game
<Dken2021> pony_4889 a pokemon shaped like a pokeball, gen I
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu|Birthday: hows your bday been going?
<TheBadger> Pony, what do you mean? I saw no ice cream poke mon in gold silver red or blue.
<CCCP> Kandarihu|Birthday happy birthday :)
<Kurra> :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, they're just morons really
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: oh yeah pokemon :D I gotta get that game. I play the first one competetively haha
<twilight_sprinkle> this game just became N-game
<AJIsAwesome> >Says that gen 5 was unoriginal
<derpy56> hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii:SDDD
<Kandarihu|Birthday> It's been alright. I ate out at Genghis Grill
<derpy56> :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> if they want real hardcore stuff
<AJIsAwesome> >DOesn't look at the other gens
<AJIsAwesome> Really?
<CrimsonPhoenix> there's actual true fighting games for it
<Zuxxez123> Normally, if there is a tourney around a game that wasnt for tourneys, the people doing the event with all the stuff figured out on what is fair and what isn't.
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu|Birthday: cool, altho i dont know what kind of food they have there :D
<Zuxxez123> I'm sure you explained that, just throwing my 2 cents. :3
<Dken2021> hahha, that's a laugh, playing gen I, the most unbalanced and broken gen of all competitely
<princess|on> try to go for the top when the soduim shooter goes up
<TheBadger> >Implying that there have been pokemon games after Silver and Gold
<TheBadger> lol
<twilight_sprinkle> pfff
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, one last thing, for me you're not serious on tourney play if you're not in EVO
<twilight_sprinkle> >implying ruby/sapphire werent amazing
<TheBadger> >implying ruby/sapphire were anything other than dumpster filler
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>implying implying
<Lunar_Brony> I have never played a single pokemon game
<TheBadger> damn
<twilight_sprinkle> they werent, they were a large step further
<Dken2021> your winning strategy: use Mewtwo, or any psychic pokemon, and you'll be dominating
<Lunar_Brony> SaxyPretender implyception!
<Rustymeat> Lunar_Brony s an alien
<twilight_sprinkle> and after kyogre/groudon took over, it was just amazing
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: true. but think of it this way. people play what they like regardless of what others think. And the more you play, the better you get thus fueling the need for competetion. Because no matter how you see it, a fighting game is competetive.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14^
<AJIsAwesome> Meh, I LOVED Black and White. You saying that Gen 5 was unoriginal doesn't faze me AT ALL. Black and White were a HUGE step in the RIGHT direction. So is B&W2.
<TheBadger> Dont know if trolling or just incredibly stupid....
<Reikim> So basically, otanet sucks.
<Reikim> And I should change ISPs.
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: dem ev
<oni_link> evs
<Zuxxez123> I was meaning to play B&W, never got around to it.
<Cypresswolf> I didnt know my brother had people over :D I go downstairs to get a shot glass and the hall from the bottom of the stairs is dark - Bro's friend Dawson got me good
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, still to me you're not serious in competition if you're not in EVO
<AJIsAwesome> I couldn't care about the EVs, IVs or anything like that.
<twilight_sprinkle> TheBadger: oh so youre one of those people who think anyone who disagrees is stupid
<AJIsAwesome> I play Pokemon because it's fun.
<Lunar_Brony> Rustymeat no, I never touched a portable system until I got a DSi, despite just about everyone I know having atleast a GBA and DS lite
<Lunar_Brony> cousins and friends
<TheBadger> Not usually, but when there's one correct answer, yes.
<sonicandmario85> TheBadger:thats his opinion respect it
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: I agree, Pokemon is a game you can pick up and play with out having a whole lot of background info on it, games like that are GREAT for just having a nice gaming session.
<princess|on> gtg at 11 D:
<AJIsAwesome> "Oh yeah, Gen 1 is best gen, all the others suck and are unoriginal!" Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: so you dont play online? I beat the story so that was what was tiding me over for the next game.
<Rustymeat> uh oh
<TheBadger> Oh, I respect his opinion, I just think it's incredibly stupid. Like Obama.
<kirz|art> depends on whether you've triggered WK mode
<twilight_sprinkle> TheBadger: well, your majesty, ruby/sapphire were great, irrelevant if you consider people who like stupid or not
<kirz|art> because if you have, there is no excape
<Dken2021> at the end, and ded
<Zuxxez123> I never played PokeMon online, ONLY single player, I didn't want to get into that scene. :P
<Cypresswolf> dammit - just waiting in the shadows as I was running down the stairs - that sneaky bastard :$
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I actually LOVED R/S.
<CrimsonPhoenix> that girlfriend should've been killed
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: almost everyone does
<Lunar_Brony> I have no opinion on it
<sonicandmario85> TheBadger:i agree obama is full of fucking lies im american but i saw the american president sucks :3
<Kurra> i am disillusioned by all the conflict here
<sonicandmario85> say*
<CCCP> Hi twilight_sprinkle
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: Okay but say they do get Smash tourneys up on EVO. would that really change your mind on it? or would you still think of it as a casual game since its nintendo
<pony_4889> where have i heard this song before?
<twilight_sprinkle> hey CCCP :)
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, smash was in evo
<TheBadger> Hmm....only got 12 rustled Jimmies. Ill have to go harder next time
<CrimsonPhoenix> the game got banned
<CrimsonPhoenix> for later years
<God> twilight sprinkle my faithful student how are you
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02This game is too easy :/
<AJIsAwesome> NewSuperBronyU: :D
<CrimsonPhoenix> Smash will NEVER get in EVO
<Rustymeat> NewSuperBronyU you will regret saying that
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: ah.
<Midnight_Stormwing> 06,08NewSuperBronyU... your easy
<oni_link> well there goes my point.
<OneTrickPony> colors!
*oni_link shrugs
<Dken2021> NewSuperBronyU too easy, then you should try I wanna be the guy, and no saving
<Lunar_Brony> ohai mid-

<Lunar_Brony> GAH
<OneTrickPony> Lunar_Brony: XD

<CrimsonPhoenix> SaxyPretender, that's what I said

<SaxyPretender> 0,14got more hype than Guilty Gear
<God> im good what have you learned about magic this week twilight
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...which is why GG hasn't returned
<Lunar_Brony> what is EVO?
<Dken2021> oh hey there God
<God> hi
<Rustymeat> music in this game is so good
<SaxyPretender> 0,14EVO is the biggest tournament series in the US
<CrimsonPhoenix> EVO is only the biggest Tourney event
<Lunar_Brony> oh
<twilight_sprinkle> God: i learned that if im going to use magic to take over cities i need to do it more subtly
<CCCP> that akward moment when i really like the that akward moment meme
<Lunar_Brony> no wonder I never heard of it
<Lunar_Brony> US
<Lunar_Brony> tournament
<God> hmm yes yes very good well keep up your studies
<Lunar_Brony> . . .
<twilight_sprinkle> yes sir!
<CrimsonPhoenix> I actually enjoy watching some tourney
<CrimsonPhoenix> rooting for the player
<CrimsonPhoenix> and get hype
<Mozdoc> Either my video stream is laggy or it seems the character in this game just goes way too fast and jumps around a lot.
<Rustymeat> anyone watchh the fighting is magic tourney?
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Rustymeat, no I havent
<twilight_sprinkle> Rustymeat: its on now?
<Rustymeat> no
<Dken2021> Mozdoc yea, meatboy's slippery
<AJIsAwesome> I'd rather play the game than watch someone do it.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14couldn't, but saw grand finals
<Rustymeat> it was yesterday
<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: Who won?
<Rustymeat> It was pretty hype
<twilight_sprinkle> i hop someone uploads it
<CrimsonPhoenix> was Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy playable?
<Dken2021> dash was playable
<SaxyPretender> 0,14uhh, Hiroshii, was it
<CrimsonPhoenix> HOLY SHIT WHAT?
<AJIsAwesome> OKay.

<AJIsAwesome> SaxyPretender: Do you know which character?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14think AJ?
<Kandarihu|Birthday> PUSH THE BUTTONS
<AJIsAwesome> Really?
<AJIsAwesome> I thought he would someone like Twilight.
<AJIsAwesome> Or perhaps Pinkie PIe.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJ is basic
<twilight_sprinkle> i guess they removed fluttersies instakill stare lol
<CrimsonPhoenix> and give hard punches
<princess|on> brb
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Wait, Instakill stare?
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: you know how you said Masahiro Sakurai didnt consider Smash as a true fighting game? Seth Kilian disagrees.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, it was a joke
<AJIsAwesome> Oh. :D

<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, no
<AJIsAwesome> oni_link: Not.
<AJIsAwesome> Nope.
<Dken2021> oni_link no, using a different engine
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's on another fighting game maker
<oni_link> oh. it looks similar. what did they use for it?
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02:<
<CrimsonPhoenix> I actually saw the same fighting game maker in another fighting game
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Fighting Game Maker 2007?
<CrimsonPhoenix> but it's not Mugen
<CrimsonPhoenix> SaxyPretender, maybe?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I forgot the year number
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but it is that engine
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02Dat Ninja Gaiden spoof cinematic
<oni_link> NewSuperBronyU: these references, i love them D:
<Dken2021> well sorta glad they didn't use mugen, otherwise we wouldn't have online multiplayer

<CrimsonPhoenix> and I can see Fluttershy selectable
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: IKR, she glides away
<xX1337caydz0rzXx> i keep forgetting to ask cynder to see if any of her friends wanna come here
<Rustymeat> Fluttershy has no hitbos and has only 1 attack
<Rustymeat> in that build
<AJIsAwesome> Meh. I'm waiting till the game comes out to give an opinion.
<Rustymeat> hitbox*

<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Not sure. I want to have some variety.
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, who are you and what have you done
<AJIsAwesome> Hm?

<CrimsonPhoenix> though RD moveset looks solid
<SadSaturn> 08,01Wrek: if you look outside and it's not cloudy, you'll probably see aurorae tonight
<oni_link> AJIsAwesome: same here, she looks like shes the most complete next to twilight. I might try pinkie
<abrony> aurorae?
<Kinixys> Hug attacks with Pinkamena. XD
<SadSaturn> 08,01i've got an aurorawatch geomagnetism red alert coming up here
<oni_link> CrimsonPhoenix: her moveset looks great but they need to work on her walking animation lol
<SadSaturn> 08,01http://aurorawatch.lancs.ac.uk/
<AJIsAwesome> Have they confirmed any other characters besides the Mane 6?
<CrimsonPhoenix> oni_link, she's not finished
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome not atm
<Rustymeat> no AJIsAwesome
<abrony> oh
<CrimsonPhoenix> heck the leak only had 4 characters
<SadSaturn> 08,01i would probably be able to see it from here if it wasn't so cloudy
<Dken2021> not yet AJIsAwesome, but probably after they release the demo
<Rustymeat> a demo is not likely
<CrimsonPhoenix> they only manage to put RD playable for CG
<SaxyPretender> 0,14well, the mane 6 will be the full release
<AJIsAwesome> SadSaturn: DAMN IT, I've always wanted to see the Aurora lights.

<princess|on> seeya tomrrow :)
<Dken2021> mhmm
<CrimsonPhoenix> you know what crazy wish i would like?
<AJIsAwesome> What?
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Snuggle Truck Adds Ponies, Plants Trees
<Rustymeat> lolwut
<AJIsAwesome> "Snuggle truck" :S
<Lunar_Brony> dufu
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Lunar_Brony> *dufuq
<Dken2021> oh that thing
<Cypresswolf> plant trees - is that like a pony chia pet kinda thing?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Watching daigo playing MLP Fighting is Magic
<Lunar_Brony> "Snuggle Truck is an over-the-top physics-based driving game where you must save your cargo full of fuzzy animals from extinction by delivering them to the zoo in the least amount of time. Tilt your truck, catch cute fuzzies, drive over armadillos, and rocket your way through hills, caverns, deserts, and forests to save the animals!"
<Cypresswolf> will the trees be in the shape of ponies :P
<Lunar_Brony> straight from the website
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm, sounds interesting.
<Lunar_Brony> should I just link the site?
<Dken2021> it was banned on the app store iirc
<Polydunami> I missed the title to this game, somehow :S
<Lunar_Brony> Snuggletruck
<Lunar_Brony> yeah
<Polydunami> No, the game on the stream.
<Rustymeat> super meat boy
<Lunar_Brony> oh
<Polydunami> I figured as such
<Lunar_Brony> yeah this is Super Meat Boy
<Dken2021> no wait, iirc, they changed it from smuggling mexicans, to smuggling teddy bears and stuff
<Rustymeat> what...
<thelonepony> wat?
<Cypresswolf> :D
<Lunar_Brony> Snuggletruck and Smuggletruck. N and M
<Lunar_Brony> both exist
<Rustymeat> wait really?
<Cypresswolf> thats too good :)
<Lunar_Brony> same game essentially, just one is with animals in danger of extinction
<Dken2021> yea, it started out as a game where you smuggle mexicans, but apple wouldn't allow it, so they changed it to what we know today, and apple allowed it
<Lunar_Brony> and the other is people getting across the border
<Rustymeat> wait this cant be real
<superretroworld> i went on reddit an typed in bronies, it gave me a whole bunch of posts just about that category, i think im gonna like this app
<Rustymeat> lolwut
<Buytoast> MAKE SURE YOU LE UPVOTE EVERYTHING ON LE REDDIT
<Cypresswolf> only on the internet can miss typing 1 letter lead to horrible consequences :D
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Lunar_Brony> eeyup
<superretroworld> Cypresswolf: not to mention auto correcting
<Cypresswolf> auto correct can sometimes save you - ever drunk type and have it correct to something that doesnt sound as bad as what you were trying to say?
<superretroworld> actually you have a good point there
<Kurra> v_v
<Rustymeat> Superbrony is gonn alove the hell beasts
<Rustymeat> YOu should get that bandage :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and so a bunch of people buy the game called "Snuggle Truck"
<sub06905> anypony else try MCPixel? the game is quite strange :D
<Zuxxez123> sub06905: Strange? Understatement much?
<Rustymeat> that game llooks great
<Dken2021> I thought about it sub06905, but I got Wizorb instead
<Derpy_Hooves> loooooooooooooooooooooooool
<Rustymeat> The greatest thing about Mcpixel is that the creator iis trying to port it to the Commador 64
<sub06905> i mean difusing a bomb in 20 seconds by picking up the sparks :D
<Zuxxez123> The fact he put McPixel on PirateBay for free, and offered for the people to give him money via paypal at whatever they thought he deserved for it.
<Rustymeat> ugh this boss sucks
<Kurra> Hit his eyes!
<Rustymeat> thats not how you beat him
<Rustymeat> just gotta avoid his fists
<Kurra> you have to jump down to within an inch of the lava, hang, then come up.
<Kurra> time for saving states
<Derpy_Hooves> Rustymeat: i actuallty know his attack pattern buy heart
<Rustymeat> the bosses are the weakest point of this game
<Dken2021> save states won't save you!
<Kurra> But they will save the contents of memory.
<Derpy_Hooves> Rustymeat: your full of shit for saying that :3
<Derpy_Hooves> the bosses are fun
<Rustymeat> :(
<Rustymeat> I guess
<Rustymeat> But there are only fun once
<Derpy_Hooves> i unlocked the hardest char in the game \:3/
<Derpy_Hooves> on my second attempt :3
<Rustymeat> bandage girl?
<Kurra> i wish I had Metroid Prime, so I coulg fight Quadaxis.
<superretroworld> Kurra: have you played super metroid?
<Rustymeat> ninja boy?
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE the music for this boss fight.
<Kurra> yes.
<Kimori> http://www.ebay.com/itm/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=120991286105
<Kimori> WTF
<Derpy_Hooves> Rustymeat: the n+ ninja is NOT the hardest char

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Cool :p
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: and there both platformers, hmmmm
<AJIsAwesome> Hmm, could they be.........NAH!
<otakon17> Yeah except one is hellishly difficult
<J_E_Smith71> AJIsAwesome: Wonder how you use a shorthand for that. Would this be SMeatB, or SMeB to tell the difference?
<superretroworld> well its not a rip off
<otakon17> Smb
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<otakon17> Wb DeadpoolDash
<DeadpoolDash> hello
<otakon17> Wb Spectrum_Rush, Sunday
<Lunar_Brony> otakon17 I thought of Stupid Mario Brothers when I looked at that
<AJIsAwesome> Either that or SMeatB.
<otakon17> Lunar_Brony: :/

<flutterchu> http://s1260.photobucket.com/albums/ii571/flutterchu2/?action=view&current=FluttershyandEvilLeafy_zps053826f8.png
<otakon17> Spectrum_Rush: I can see joins
<AJIsAwesome> Soccer was great, basketball was okay, but I'm not sure about football.
<AJIsAwesome> I'll have to wait until it comes out to see.
<Lunar_Brony> AJIsAwesome he, Stupid Mario Soccer was funny. "Red card because . . . because . . . because I hate you!"
<Spectrum_Rush> otakon17: still , i mean you sent that before i even could see the chat, since im on a phone :p
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02All dem Mario pings
<Lunar_Brony> Marco:
<Lunar_Brony> oops
<Rustymeat> Polo
<OneTrickPony|homewor> XD
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: Oh yeah, Red Card. :D
<Lunar_Brony> ROFL
<AJIsAwesome> Lunar_Brony: I remeber that. :D
<Rustymeat> this level sucks
<Lunar_Brony> we should totally stream the series
<superretroworld> has it been streamed before?
<AJIsAwesome> I can't tell which one I find better: The GC one or the Wii one.
<kirz|art> I'm going to design her OC, and while we were talking she cracked a Chris Farley joke
<XAX> Where I currently have myself seated http://i.imgur.com/0emem.jpg
<XAX> .-.
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld not that I recall, although I became a brony long after episode 75
<Lunar_Brony> XAX nice!
<thelonepony> nice XAX
<Lunar_Brony> I'm on a couch
<OneTrickPony|homewor> XAX: that's sp beautifu;
<AJIsAwesome> GC makes it seem more realistic while Wii takes away the realism and puts in more action and difficulty.
<Lunar_Brony> in my basement
<AJIsAwesome> XAX: Beautiful.
<Kinixys> That's a pleasent spot XaX
<AJIsAwesome> I'm in my dorm, doing homework.
<AJIsAwesome> That is, if I was working on it right now. :D
<SaxyPretender> 0,14nice
<OneTrickPony|homewor> XAX: where do you live?
<XAX> AJIsAwesome: Its actually getting kind of chilly, as you may be able to tell by the clouds.
<XAX> wor: New Zealand c:
<OneTrickPony|homewor> oh
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: ikr. the weekend has gone by, and despite my promises, ive done nothing productive. god i hate myself
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Same here.
*OneTrickPony|homewor buys plane ticket to New Zealand
<XAX> wat. OneTrickPony|homewor, is what I mean .-. Not just wor.
<otakon17> Yeah unproductivity
<superretroworld> Lunar_Brony: great episode. 'i threw the captain crunch directly to you, also i snapped your head during that flashback' xD
<OneTrickPony|homewor> lol okay ^_^
<otakon17> Someone que up the pic
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE Captain Crunhc.
<AJIsAwesome> *Crunch
<otakon17> Seriously
<superretroworld> captain crunch is okay, resse puffs is my favorite
<otakon17> Why does touching other meat kill you?
<Rustymeat> Captain is terrible
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld that was Pirate Crunch. My favourite part was Captain Morgan's Secret Rum Technique: Drunken Fooool!
<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: i like the cereal, hate the commercials.
<Rustymeat> its sooooo terrible
<otakon17> Does that mean you are allergic to yourself?
<twilight_sprinkle> ive never tried capn crunch. i like the plain ones with raisins and the fruit loops. i hate lucky charms tho
<otakon17> Give me frosted mini wheats any day
<AJIsAwesome> I mean, how do you sel a cereal like that using that method?
<Rustymeat> MINI WHEATS ARE SOOOO GOOOOOD
<Rustymeat> HHHNNNNGGG
<superretroworld> AJIsAwesome: amazing things can happen when you taste resse puffs xD Lunar_Brony he just drank the whole bottle xD
<Kinixys> Plain ol' cherios are good, even without milk.
<Kandarihu|Birthday> I don't even eat cereal for breakfast. I always have Toaster Scrambles
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: I loved Lucky Charms until one day I ate it and then I said, "Wait a minute, these don't taste the same."
<crazypony> i <3 cinnamon toast crunch
<superretroworld> ^good cereal
<Lunar_Brony> superretroworld and then he passed out drunk
<Zuxxez123> I like Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Can't get enough of that stuff!
<AJIsAwesome> I actually don't like Cinnamon Toast Crunch. :$
<twilight_sprinkle> i either eat cereal or those quaker oatmeals
<XAX> Nutri-grain is where it's at.
*Lunar_Brony Why are we all talking in our heads?
<otakon17> At this point I would be screaming at the tv
<Marco> Ohai Lunar_Brony!.. aww
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: they were to sugary for me
<Ryunosuke> applejacks, is ... awesome :)
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE Honey Nut Cherrios, though. :D
<Lunar_Brony> hi Marco
<XAX> Or banana on toast. Banana on toast is best toast.
<otakon17> Ryunosuke: There. i see it
<Kinixys> I try and make breakfast muffin related whenever possible.
<Zuxxez123> Cherrios are the top 3 up there.
<Ryunosuke> :) but it is
<AJIsAwesome> I couldn't stand Cheerios as a kid. :$

<AJIsAwesome> I WANT THAT NINTENDO CEREAL BACK.
<Zuxxez123> otakon17: I WANT!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> otakon17: o.o lol i wanna try those now
<otakon17> AJIsAwesome: Imagine a tiny cookie filled with pudding and shaped like a poptart
<Zuxxez123> Now I have a sudden urge for Smores, thanks chat. :P
<AJIsAwesome> otakon17: Sounds delicious.
<Ryunosuke> http://www.padinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/cereal1.jpg -- for all you young whippersnappers

<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: You don't have to. :D
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol did anyone notice those yoyo ball commercials? lol its the SAME one from the 90's :D
<superretroworld> hey NewSuperBronyU, dont eat the mushrooms
<Cypresswolf> might be in my backup hard drive :|
<Zuxxez123> Knytt Story reference superretroworld?
<superretroworld> Zuxxez123: eeyup
<twilight_sprinkle> every level of this game i think "this cant get much harder" and every time im wrong
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Oh yeah, I remember those. :D
<AJIsAwesome> ANyone here remember "Sock em' Boppers"?
<superretroworld> Zuxxez123: therunawayguys popularized it more
<Zuxxez123> superretroworld: Yup. Gimme a brohoof for the reference friend. /)
<AJIsAwesome> I love the Runaway guys. :D
<Cypresswolf> :'( http://www.buzzfeed.com/daves4/25-foods-youll-never-eat-again
<superretroworld> Zuxxez123: (\

<AJIsAwesome> Especially there Mario Party playthrough.
<AJIsAwesome> *their
<AJIsAwesome> What's their new one? I haven't seen it
<Zuxxez123> Mario Party playthrough is what got me into the Runaway Guys. That and coming from ProtonJon.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: and Beyblades? man it was back when it first came out now we got this "Beywheels" crap /)_- its like "...REALLY?!?" lol
<superretroworld> fortune street
<twilight_sprinkle> oh man i remember those sprite remixes
<twilight_sprinkle> were pretty good
<AJIsAwesome> Sketch_Toku_Brony: YES. I miss Beyblade.
<AJIsAwesome> How was Fortune Street? I never played it.
<Cypresswolf> :O NO! Squeeze-its are gone :'(
<Ryunosuke> french toast crunch was actually pretty good
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: new stuff are Fortune Street gameplays.
<Ryunosuke> surge was good
<Kandarihu|Birthday> I think NewSuperBronyU is getting a bit hasty with some of these jumps
<AJIsAwesome> Ah. Okay.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> AJIsAwesome: ikr? when it first came out it was so cool. lol every kid in my school had one
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVED Beyblade as a kid.
<thelonepony> Apple Newtons nooo :'(
<Kinixys> Four Loko. That stuff is crazy.
<AJIsAwesome> We were addicted to beyblade.
<AJIsAwesome> WAIT
<Ryunosuke> Crystal pepsi, the world is better off without :)
<Cypresswolf> Dammit! Oreo-O too - I dont want to live on this planet anymore
<otakon17> Beyblade
<AJIsAwesome> Apple newtonw?
<otakon17> They
<otakon17> Are
<Zuxxez123> Beyblade, a time where things were simpler.
<OneTrickPony|homewor> beyblade was the best
<AJIsAwesome> DARN IT!!
<otakon17> Fucking
<Ryunosuke> Squeezits were decent enough :)
<twilight_sprinkle> Cypresswolf: ikr
<otakon17> Spinning TOPS!
<AJIsAwesome> otakon17: Yep, they're wheels now.
<twilight_sprinkle> never tried squeezits, always looked poisoinous to me
<otakon17> AJIsAwesome: -_____________-
<AJIsAwesome> Just like Yu-Gi-Oh did. Card Games on Motorcycles.
<otakon17> CK|Ded: How come ded?
<AJIsAwesome> Well, the last show.
<otakon17> AJIsAwesome: Another series I loathe
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i feel the same way otakon17
<Kandarihu|Birthday> Beyblade is a bit too simple, right?
<thelonepony> eeyup
<Zuxxez123> As simple as simple gets.
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf: I LOVED Oreo O's.
<AJIsAwesome> THEY WERE AMAZING.
<Zuxxez123> Oreo O's! Oh my GOD!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> oh yeah i remember those!
<otakon17> AJIsAwesome: Also we're watching the YGO Pyramid of Light movie come Friday
<Ryunosuke> i didnt prefer them myself
<thelonepony> i think they still sell them in my local market
<otakon17> Goddammit
<AJIsAwesome> otakon17: Okay. Seems interesting.
<otakon17> AJIsAwesome: Its yGO
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> otakon17: norm or AB?
<CK|Ded> otakon17: Partially sleep, partially mood
<otakon17> Sketch_Toku_Brony: I hope both
<AJIsAwesome> otakon17: Wait, yGO? :S
<otakon17> Yugioh
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> otakon17: lol that would be funny
<otakon17> Damn tiny keyboard
<AJIsAwesome> Oh.
<otakon17> Anyhoo
<otakon17> It'll come down to "Trusting in the heart of the cards"
*otakon17 shudders
<CK|Ded> You mean cheating
<Kinixys> psstt 'that's code for cheating'
<CK|Ded> Because he's clearly cheating in every single episode
<otakon17> No more like dumb luck
<CK|Ded> No, I mean cheating.
<CK|Ded> Case in point: "Soldier of Stone, destroy The Moon!"
<otakon17> Okay
<otakon17> Whats the stats on them?
<Laurayne> Hello Everypony :)
<Zuxxez123> I trust the heart of the cards in Magic the Gathering on XBLA, and it works for me!
<otakon17> Hiya Laurayne wb
<thelonepony> hi Laurayne
<Kandarihu|Birthday> Heart of the Cards is just a dub invention. In the original, he's just hoping for a good draw, and usually gets it.
<Kinixys> I saw this guy with a tatoo of ACE playing card on his wrist. XD
<Laurayne> Thanks
<otakon17> Zuxxez123: -___________________-;
<CK|Ded> otakon17: Soldier of Stone is a 1300/2000, and The Moon is a Magic Card.
<kirz|art> hey Sumica, if you're lurking, can you PM me?
<Zuxxez123> otakon17: Dat face. :3 That's what I wanted.
<twilight_sprinkle> still got my blue-eyes white dragon. awesome foil on that card
<AJIsAwesome> Stupid internet derping. :|
<otakon17> CK|Ded: Special ability perhaps?
<CK|Ded> Nope.
<sub06905> Gundam Style shirt :D http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/zoom/f25b_gundamstyle.jpg
<AJIsAwesome> I had 2 of the Exodius cards, I think.
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: :|
<Laurayne> I Just Love Midnight Rain Showers, Dont You All? :)
<AJIsAwesome> I can't remember
<sub06905> twilight_sprinkle: o.o?
<otakon17> CK|Ded: Well c'mon there has to be something then
<CK|Ded> Soldier of Stone had no enhancements or anything either. His monster just attacks a magic card and destroys it.
<Cypresswolf|Glitch> Whatever happened to Hawiian Punch? I never see that anymore - nor the commercials for it
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: YES, I love rain during the night time. :)
<CK|Ded> Because that is totally how the game works.
<AJIsAwesome> Also, hi Laurayne. :)
<CK|Ded> Oh, and then there's the more infamous one.
<otakon17> Laurayne: Sky is clear here and a bright full moon at that
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: linking anything gangam related is a crime punishable by law. what say you as your final words?
<Laurayne> Hello AJIsAwesome
<Zuxxez123> I like when it rains most times, mostly at day time, I like when it's darker for some reason...
<sub06905> twilight_sprinkle: i have learned the G3 theme song and i regret nothing
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: very well then
<otakon17> CK|Ded: Swords of Binding Light or the special summonings rules that get ignored?
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: Same here.
<CK|Ded> "I use my Catapult Turtle to launch my dragon monster at your floating fortress monster, destroying its levitation belt and causing it to fall on top of all of your other monsters, which somehow drops your LP to zero."
*twilight_sprinkle throws sub06905 into a volcano
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE it when it rains.
<twilight_sprinkle> me too
<thelonepony> me too^
<otakon17> CK|Ded: Ah yes
<AJIsAwesome> Especially for long periods of time.
<Zuxxez123> Ditto AHJ.
<Zuxxez123> AJ*
<Ryunosuke> CK|Ded, what?
<sub06905> little did twilight_sprinkle, sub06905 was the volcano
<twilight_sprinkle> unfortunately all i get are wimpy 30 minute rains maximum
<Laurayne> Me Too
<sub06905> know*
<Zuxxez123> AJIsAwesome: Do you like a small drizzle, or a heavy rain?
<Laurayne> I Love Storms And/Or Overcast Weather
<AJIsAwesome> Zuxxez123: In the middle, IMO.
<twilight_sprinkle> sub06905: so i threw you inside yourself
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: YES.
<AJIsAwesome> JUST YES.
<sub06905> rain is best weather
<CK|Ded> Like I said, "Heart of the Cards" is code for "cheat my ass off". I think no one knows the rules of the card game and they just make up the effects as they go.
<Ryunosuke> i mean, i seen that particular episode and was 'wait, what? YGO does NOT work like that"
<AJIsAwesome> I LOVE Overcast.
<thelonepony> Lasharus: yes i love it
<otakon17> CK|Ded: Screw the rules I have crazy hair?
<Zuxxez123> Laurayne: We are in the same boat my friend. Overcast is an awesome feeling for me.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Ryunosuke> nonono
<Zuxxez123> I love also being able to smell the rain as it comes. :3
<CK|Ded> Anyways, sleep.
<Laurayne> Night/Overcast Day Is When I Feel Most At Peace
<AJIsAwesome> I've never done that. :$
<Ryunosuke> its due to his power source, his.... leather pants
<Cades> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFhJaxrN6zE&feature=g-vrec im dying hahaha
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, CK|Ded :)
<twilight_sprinkle> bye CK|Ded
<Kinixys> YuGiOh abridged is worth checking out if anypony hasn't somehow heard of it.
<Zuxxez123> Maybe I am crazy, but I swear I can small rain. xD
<Cypresswolf|Glitch> I remember a little pack of crispy bread sticks with a little tub of fake cheese in my lunchbox in my youth - what was that called?
<Kandarihu|Birthday> CK|Ded, no it isn't. Wishing for a lucky draw isn't cheating. And neither is getting it. If anything, it's plot armor
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> ya know what would be a neat cosplay? a John Marston cosplay BUT styled and theme after Applejack
<Dken2021_> Ryunosuke ah, that's where you're wrong, it's the shoes
<Laurayne> Your Right. Rain Does Have A Scent
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf|Glitch: I know what you're talking about, but I can't remember.
<Zuxxez123> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Lol, I'd like to see that.
<flutterchu> Kinixys: what do you mean that my computer is agianst google (is there anyway to fix it)
<J_E_Smith71> Cypresswolf|Glitch: Handi-Snacks
<twilight_sprinkle> my god this game is the embodiment of evil
<Cypresswolf|Glitch> :) Dunkaroos come to mind but that had chocolate didnt it? Handi Snaks ^_^ Thats it!
<AJIsAwesome> YES.
<AJIsAwesome> DUNKAROOS
<Ryunosuke> ahhheheh
<Kinixys> flutterchu: I was just cracking a joke. What seems to be your trouble?
<AJIsAwesome> That was the Crystal Meth of my childhood. :$
<flutterchu> oh no ;_;
<Laurayne> Im Sorry If Im Not Mentioning The People Im Talking About In My Messages. Im Still Getting Used TO It lol AJIsAwesome Zuxxez123
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: It's no problem. :)
<Zuxxez123> Laurayne: No worries, I'm used to not having that feature, I keep up with our convo. :3
<magmablock> Can't wait to see the replay of this one
<AJIsAwesome> magmablock: Me too. :D
<Laurayne> Theres Just So Much Info To Read At Once Its Overwhelming For Me So Its Nice To Have Those Little Blips
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: I know that feeling.
<Kandarihu|Birthday> AJIsAwesome, me neither. The fall at the beginning is going to be amazing
<Zuxxez123> Laurayne: Agreed whole-heartedly there. :3
<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu|Birthday: I LOVE Fall. One of my favorite seasons.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> i wonder if the Apple Marston cosplay would be funnier w/ a bandolier of apples and wut not? :D
<magmablock> sadface
<AJIsAwesome> Spring>Fall>Winter>Summer.
<Kandarihu|Birthday> Aw
<Zuxxez123> Sketch_Toku_Brony: Once again... I would love to see that.
<Laurayne> And With My Slow Reading/Bad Eyes/ Slow Typeing, Its Really Not Helping AJIsAwesome Zuxxez123
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Zuxxez123: i may draw up an idea eventually
<magmablock> Thank God there's no loading screen when you die
<twilight_sprinkle> ^^^^^^^^
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: Ah, I see.
<Zuxxez123> Laurayne: Years of being background noise in plenty of chat rooms have made me hone my abilities on reading / typing. :P
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> magmablock: lol imagine SMB w/ Sonic 2006 loading times muhaha
<Laurayne> I Really Know That Feeling Too Well Zuxxez123
<AJIsAwesome> Can't wait for new pony episodes, so much text. :D
<Zuxxez123> Sketch_Toku_Brony: When you start doing that concept art, let me know, I'd LOVE to see it. :3
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> sure thing Zuxxez123
<Kinixys> SMB needs more cutscenes (unskipable prefered). *ducks*
<Laurayne> What Game Is This Anyway? It Seems Difficult
<AJIsAwesome> Kinixys: :D
<AJIsAwesome> Super Meat Boy.
<Laurayne> I See
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> >.< so close
<Zuxxez123> Is it wrong of me to hear his reactions to dying so many times?
<Laurayne> It Looks Like Meatwad
<Cypresswolf|Glitch> looking up discontinued stuff of the 80's now :) anyone remember Planter's Cheese Balls?
<OneTrickPony|homewor> what is the white lumps supposed to represent?
<Zuxxez123> Sounds... Interesting Cypresswolf|Glitch :P
<AJIsAwesome> I don't. Sound familiar.
<NewSuperBronyU> 11,02OneTrickPony|homewor: Maggots.
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<Cypresswolf|Glitch> Smack Cereal is long gone :(
<OneTrickPony|homewor> oh
<twilight_sprinkle> im amazed people would actually spend money on this game just to torture themselves
<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf|Glitch: I think I still see Smack.
<Kinixys> Honey Smacks?
<Cypresswolf|Glitch> Shark Bites gummi snacks
<Laurayne> I Enjoy Plain (Non Frosted) Corn Flakes More Then Any Cereal...
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and i was wondering why i was getting pings
<Spectrum_Rush> ok... so whos playing super meat boy?
<J_E_Smith71> I miss Campbell's Creamy Chicken Alfredo soup. That stuff was the best canned soup ever
<AJIsAwesome> J_E_Smith71: Wait, they had that?
<AJIsAwesome> DANGIT!
<Kandarihu|Birthday> twilight_sprinkle, some gamers value challenge in their games. It's not torture.
<AJIsAwesome> I love Chicken Alfredo.
<Cypresswolf|Glitch> Dr. Pepper Chewing Gum
<Kinixys> I've seen shark bites and honey smacks at my grocer.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Cypresswolf|Glitch> Power Puff Girls Cereal
<AJIsAwesome> WAIT
<AJIsAwesome> PPG Cereal?
<Zuxxez123> Dr. Pepper / Mountain Dew flavored Chap Stick... I remember that stuff.
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<Cypresswolf|Glitch> I had no idea either AJ

<Laurayne> Hehehe SOmeone Should Make A Ceral Box Picture Edit With Applejack On The Front Of Applejacks :P
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: I've seen that before. ALL MY MONEY. :D

<AJIsAwesome> Cypresswolf|Glitch: I actually never had that. What would it be like?
<Kandarihu|Birthday> Shizuka, PETA raged against this game by making a parody called Super Tofu Boy. Edmund McMillan got back at them in grand style
<superretroworld> Cypresswolf|Glitch: thats good
<Shizuka> 13oh pixel perfect platformers, your cheeky ways of faking difficulty by making a margin of error smaller than the player's control resolution
<Cypresswolf|Glitch> http://discontinuedfoods.com/image/14334557684 That's What I'm Talking About!
<AJIsAwesome> Laurayne: That seems like a good idea. :)

<Sabershy> Hey,AJIsAwesome. :)
<Shizuka> 13mystlike
<YNOP> Where's the game?
<Polydunami> I see
<Shizuka> 13this is building up the story so
<Polydunami> No, you see, that guy actually talks like that :P
<Shizuka> 13what they're letting you infer is this... you play Gage Blackwood, Agent 5 at the Temporal Security Agency in the 2300s
<Shizuka> 13that guy that just died invented time travel
<Shizuka> 13your org is tasked with making sure people don't screw with history
<Cypresswolf|Glitch> I'm off to bed - goodnight everypony :)
<Polydunami> So are you timed?
<AJIsAwesome> NIght, Cypresswolf|Glitch :)
<Shizuka> 13nah

<Shizuka> 13this is the only one i've played
<YNOP> The Extraterrial looks like ahhh..... ._.?
<Polydunami> Or, track down the ones who are actually messing around with the timeline.
<Shizuka> 13that
<AJIsAwesome> It's a game.
<Buytoast> oh, is this 12 monkeys?
<Shizuka> 13agent 3 went rogue, she's the one from the opening
<Zuxxez123> I missed if it said the title of the game or anything; what is this?
<Garettbrony> Shizuka who is this
<YNOP> The day when the earth as been doubled
<Polydunami> The Journeyman Project, Zuxxez123.
<Polydunami> 3.
<Garettbrony> Pegasus?
<Shizuka> 13i could imagine either one of these guys being a Doctor :3
<Zuxxez123> Thank you kindly Polydunami.
<Shizuka> 13also you're about to see what i mean about mouse control sucking >>
<Garettbrony> thats not a delorean
<Polydunami> So long as they can affect a believable British accent of their choosing, huh?
<Shizuka> 13agent blackwood maybe not but i can totally see the other guy being a Doctor
<Shizuka> 13reminds me of tennant
<Polydunami> The one in the background?
<Shizuka> 13yeah
<Shizuka> 13oki here we go
<Polydunami> Yeah, kind of
<Garettbrony> Shizuka what is this we are watching?

<thelonepony> nope
<Zuxxez123> He is note.

<Mega_Milk> Shizuka: Ha!

<YNOP> Pe-Ka-BOO!
<Sylandest> lol, arthur
<Cades> im guessing because its tool assisted
<Shizuka> 13this VA has been in other stuff too
<Polydunami> Sounds a little like Norm Macdonald. Just a little.
<YNOP> ...
<Shizuka> 13>comes from the 2300s
<Shizuka> 13>still uses analog video
<otakon17> Crap
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: why do I get the feeling that was a fanboy
<otakon17> Damn virus is on the suit
<Garettbrony> the TSA? time for strip searched?
<Shizuka> 13it's an AI that lives in your helmet
<otakon17> I thought it was a virus
<Shizuka> 13he'll keep you guys informed while i flail the camera around
<Shizuka> 13well he annoyed agent 3
<Kimori> When you play the game you can spell the right answer wrong and still get it right
<Kimori> This guy takes advantage of it
<Shizuka> 13the player is apparently okay with him since they were together for journeyman project 2
<Sylandest> lol
<Kimori> he basicly adds words that are not necessary and the game just doesnt pick it up
<otakon17> Okay
<otakon17> Lol
<Sylandest> no memory of me. But I'm your best friend!
<Polydunami> This begs the question, Shizuka; have you played the first game?
<Shizuka> 13well HE remembers you
<Kimori> but picks up the right words so it thinks you had the right word
<Shizuka> 13i haven't played first either
<Shizuka> 13this is the only one i have
<Polydunami> Right
<Cades> oh
<otakon17> Lol again
<Sylandest> keep on, Shizu. I'm sure you'll beat it like all the others
<Garettbrony> Comense Flailing
<Kimori> I saw the video years ago, thought it was clever
<Cades> i have not clue whats going on
<kirz|art> sleepy time, have a good night everypony :)
<Sylandest> night kirz|art :)
<Polydunami> Arthur really likes to cut himself off sometimes, huh.
<Garettbrony> thats not Christorpher Lloyd
<Shizuka> 13yeah i'll have to be careful with the cues
<YNOP> I can't sleep :'(
<Shizuka> 13also i'm barely clicking and you can see how bad the camera is
<thelonepony> I can't sleep either YNOP
*AdamTheDuck hugs YNOP
<AdamTheDuck> Confound these ponies, they drive you to insomnia :P
<Shizuka> 13arthur gives you hints, and then gets cheeky about them :3
<Polydunami> Apparently, the guy who voices Arthur is named Matt Weinhold or something.
<AJIsAwesome> YNOP: I know that feeling.
<Cades> gonna idle for a bit. night if i dont come back
<AJIsAwesome> Insomnia gets the best of us.
<flutterchu> i feel pain in my dreams
<AJIsAwesome> That sucks. :(
<flutterchu> *YN-I think he/she left
<YNOP> This game as release in?
<Polydunami> This one was published in 1998.
<Kimori> k
<Kimori> night :)
<AdamTheDuck> *cough* rope ladder *cough* :D
<Buytoast> Cope Hatter
<Kimori> ill probably be up another hour
<Buytoast> Hope Platter
<Polydunami> As far as I know, the first game was published in 1992.
<Sylandest> pervy robot
<Cades> yeah I'll be back before then
<otakon17> Can you smack him?
<Buytoast> so this is halflife source
<Buytoast> looks different than the rest of the series
<otakon17> No you idjit
<Polydunami> He's more like an AI than a robot, honestly.
<YNOP> . . .
<Garettbrony> that robot buddy of his reminds me of Tom Servo and Crow T Robot from Mst3k
<otakon17> Its The Journeyman Project
<otakon17> Also cussing?
<otakon17> I'm surprised
<Sylandest> eclipse?
<Sylandest> oh my
<Polydunami> Yeah, I can see why you would hate the controls; if the 'looking around' part is as jumpy as it seems to be in this stream...
<Shizuka> 13yeah
<Buytoast> oh shit
<Buytoast> signs is back
<otakon17> Okay the hell
<Shizuka> 13it's just a bug with the VM though i'm sure
<Buytoast> get in the bunker
<Sylandest> welp
<Shizuka> 13the demo wasn't that bad
<otakon17> Okaaaaaaaaay
<Garettbrony> If there is one thing I have learned from Bronystate is that the Mods are really into Ponies (duh) MST3K, Adventure Games, Retro Gaming, and Geeky Movies. My kind of People
<Polydunami> So it's not as jumpy without the videomaster?
<Shizuka> 13you may have noticed the xp boot screen earlier :3
<otakon17> Shizuka: Maybe its bc your streaming it?
<Shizuka> 13this is a virtual machine
<Shizuka> 13of win xp
<otakon17> Shizuka: Thats why
<Shizuka> 13it's a bug with the VM is all
<Shizuka> 13but this won't run on win 7
<Shizuka> 13much less run on win 7 and let scrcap latch on
<otakon17> Shizuka: You couldn't do the usual compatibility option?
<Shizuka> 13not that
<Zuxxez123> Garettbrony: I agree with that, these are my kinda people. :P
<Shizuka> 13it needs libraries etc that aren't in vista/7
<Garettbrony> Shizuka what OS are you running and what emulator and where can I get this game?
<Shizuka> 13asuka is windows 7, this is oracle virtualbox running windows xp
<Polydunami> This is Cleverbot as if he behaved 100% like a human.
<Garettbrony> nice
<Buytoast> i'm liking eyeball jar there
<Garettbrony> jesus this AI should be on the Satilite of Love not in this mans Time Suit
<Sylandest> :D
<Polydunami> I hope the inventory system doesn't work quite John Egbert's in Homestuck...
<AdamTheDuck> You named your computer Asuka, Shizu? :3
<Polydunami> *like, not quite
<twilight_sprinkle> so wait Shizuka , did you finish myst?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> looks like the building from the mummy 3 where you find the direction too Shangri-La
<Shizuka> 13revelation was done in one day
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: Yep.
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah she finished Myst IV twilight_sprinkle... I think.
<twilight_sprinkle> crap, i missed the ending..
<Garettbrony> that AI and to many funny quips to be annoying
<Shizuka> 13the worst part of the camera
<Shizuka> 13I CAN'T NOD AND SHAKE MY HEAD ><
<Garettbrony> Pope Bladder
<Shizuka> 13you'll have to make do with cursor flailing..
<Buytoast> Mope Nadder
<Garettbrony> trope Flatter
<Shizuka> 13rope ladder was left behind in atlantis
<Polydunami> Well, are you expected to make those movements to progress with the game, Shizuka?
<Garettbrony> barn
<Buytoast> Dope Padder
<Polydunami> Like Mass Effect, but you control your head movements?
<Shizuka> 13it's camera control is all
<Shizuka> 13looking around
<Polydunami> Right
<Shizuka> 13but the VM has introduced a bug that the camera swings faster than it should
<Shizuka> 13allow me to demonstrate
<Polydunami> Yeowch
<Shizuka> 13obviously i should be able to drag closer to edge and not flail around
<Shizuka> 13again, it's a bug with the VM, no fix
<Garettbrony> you spin me right rould like a recond baby
<flutterchu> i here lightning :'(
<Polydunami> It's not coming from me, flutterchu :P
<Shizuka> 13the audio bug is new to this run i think, i had to troubleshoot the audio earlier
<Shizuka> 13so, stuttering is also no fix, sorry
<Shizuka> 13still, it works well
<Polydunami> Well, it's not crashing, so that's a plus.
<Shizuka> 13not crashing *yet*
<Polydunami> Oh dear
<Garettbrony> xp = Good , Vista= shit , 7 = Meh, Its Okay
<Shizuka> 13XP is horrendously outdated
<otakon17> Dammit

<taoumi> can we request old kung-fu movies for movie night?
<flutterchu> i mean if you look at the corner
<Garettbrony> That AI was probably the invention of Joel Robinson
<J_E_Smith71> taoumi: Of course
<Polydunami> Apparently created by a Dr. Kenneth Farnstein, Arthur was.
<Polydunami> Dammit, me and my Yoda language -_(\
<flutterchu> brb i half to know who gets to be the first one eliminated on the reality show i signed up (i have immunity (3 )

<NocturnalBlade|HW> killerpony7733: cool, high school or college?
<Garettbrony> I'll say
<Polydunami> Now this is getting interesting
<killerpony7733> NocturnalBlade|HW Not sure, i am not a american i live in denmark
<Polydunami> Are the Cyrollans the villain race or something?
<killerpony7733> NocturnalBlade|HW So mines just 10th class
<Garettbrony> i live in Neighbraska
<NocturnalBlade|HW> killerpony7733: oh XD my bad
<Shizuka> 13it's probably established in the first two, but in the 2300s humanity makes contact with the Cyrollans and enters an alliance
<killerpony7733> NocturnalBlade|HW Ah anyone can make the mistake
<Shizuka> 13they call it the symbiatry or something
<Polydunami> Right
<Shizuka> 13but they're good guys
<AJIsAwesome> Alright, time for me to hit the hay. Good night, everyone! :)

<SaxyPretender> 0,14half expected a DA LAWWWW
<Buytoast> oh shit when did the grandpa from grounded for life get here
<Shizuka> 13journeyman project 1 deals with you, agent blackwood, stopping this guy, father of time travel, from killing the cyrollan ambassador
<Buytoast> and why does he have so many chins
<Polydunami> Okay, I looked this guy up, and it seems he's played by an actor named Graham Jarvis.
<Shizuka> 13yeah looking through the imdb i don't see anything i'd recognize him from
*Garettbrony plays amazing grace
<Polydunami> I recognize him from a bit part in M*A*S*H, actually.
<OneTrickPony|homewor> im going to sleep now see ya guys later ^-^
<Polydunami> He played Colonel Whiteman, aide to General MacArthur who was to visit the 4077th.
<RoboGerbil> what is this?
<Polydunami> The Journeyman Project. This is the third game.
<Polydunami> Oh, good night, OneTrickPony!

<Polydunami> They're, actually.
<AdamTheDuck> Night OneTrickPony|homewor
<killerpony7733> Quel'thalas?
<Shizuka> 13yeah it's obvious CG but it's really good CG
<Polydunami> Fair for its day, I suppose
<Polydunami> But it doesn't actually distract from the game itself.
<Polydunami> Or detract, for that matter.
<Shizuka> 13it's the elcor!
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> too many emotions to be elcor
<Polydunami> I like this guy's facial expressions :D
<Polydunami> He's so serious, he's hilarious
<Quorl_Changeling> Back at the bat-cave, hah
<Polydunami> So. Do you eventually have to visit all three times?
<Garettbrony> Authur reminds me of tom servo and crow t robot from mst3k

<Polydunami> Oh yeah, this place
<taoumi> PARKOUR
<Polydunami> Oh, Arthur
<SaxyPretender> 0,14Cage is a Scootaloo
<Shizuka> 13yeah he's just getting started :3
<Garettbrony> Arthur's witty banter keeps him from being annoying
<Shizuka> 13also i can speed it up :3
<Polydunami> The voice clips or the video?
<taoumi> and they totaly can't hear the THUNKTHUNKTHUNK of the running
<Shizuka> 13video
<Shizuka> 13specifically transitions between nodes
<Shizuka> 13cause sometimes he walks sloooooooow
<Polydunami> Nice
<Quorl_Changeling> I love the jokes
<Shizuka> 13he's got a ton
<taoumi> the other lever krunk
<Shizuka> 13just wait

<Quorl_Changeling> Set gears
<Garettbrony> Arthur r u a member of the satilite of love?

<Polydunami> Good night, Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Quorl_Changeling> Definitely Myst
<AdamTheDuck> Night Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Polydunami> Well, how many Myst games do you know that have witty exposition fairies?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but Shizuka, ninjas aren't supposed to be seen
<Quorl_Changeling> HOITYTOITY
<Polydunami> They're supposed to blend in with the crowd, SaxyPretender
<Garettbrony> exposition
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, wow, Gilligan's Island reference
<Shizuka> 13it's not myst but it's in the vein of myst
<Shizuka> 13saxy got it :3
<SaxyPretender> 0,14:3
<Polydunami> I need to see that show
<Cades> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdVuEpD9_IY
<Polydunami> All I know is the theme
<Garettbrony> Star Trek
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> how did he know there was a native outside of view ?
<Shizuka> 13he just does
<Quorl_Changeling> BURK
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> dat 4th wall breaker guide
<Shizuka> 13it's a lazy way of explaining the mechanic
<Shizuka> 13that you have to be disguised as a native of the time to interact or be seen
<Shizuka> 13cause you obviously can't walk up to someone in 2300s armor when you're in ancient atlantis :3
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Star gate thins diferently
<Shizuka> 13well yeah
<Polydunami> So does Doctor Who, actually
<Shizuka> 13don't think there's any stargate references
<Garettbrony> mst3k refs just by the character of aurthur alone
<Shizuka> 13i thought doctor who said the tardis disguises and translates for you
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> translates sure
<Polydunami> I've seen the Doctor hang out with Aztec... Mayan... things.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> disguised i don't think so
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Polydunami> People.
<Shizuka> 13well anyway
<Shizuka> 13it's an extra loophole that all three of these civs get blown up tomorrow
<Shizuka> 13so really who cares if you're seen in future costume
<Shizuka> 13they're dead anyway and can't affect the timeline
<taoumi> isn'tthere like an invisability option like the other suits?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> inb4 they see you, get scared, run out of the city before it gets destroy
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> let's play a song so the boat can sleep
<Kimori> lol
<Shizuka> 13the tiny text is a VM bug too i think
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fun fact: the name for a Creten double-headed axe is a Labrys
<RoboGerbil> dont visit pompeii on volcano day
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and atlantis speaks english cause reasons
<Shizuka> 13arthur's translating
<Shizuka> 13and
<Polydunami> Great imitation
<Shizuka> 13shooping your eyes so the lips sync?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> nothing to look here just a blind man climbing a boat
<SaxyPretender> 0,14can I assume time wizardry?
<Polydunami> Well, looks like the Laughing Man has some competition
<Quorl_Changeling> Cagey, locked up, hah!
<Shizuka> 13>prisoner on a ship
<Shizuka> 13>has atlantean coins for you
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ikr
<Polydunami> I like that wig
<Cades> "You don't use narcotics do you Bob?"
<Buytoast> damn that blind guy can climb like a frantic monkey
<Shizuka> 13just speeding up video
<Quorl_Changeling> >blind old man
<Quorl_Changeling> >climbing mast
<Polydunami> Have you tried changing your form in front of someone?
<Shizuka> 13can't
<Shizuka> 13they'd see it and freak out
<Polydunami> Doesn't even give you the option?
<Buytoast> oh shit, its the guy from stargate
<Shizuka> 13nah
<Shizuka> 13see watch, i'll try
<Quorl_Changeling> Dat jerk
<Buytoast> eat his soul or something
<Buytoast> you're from the futrue
<Shizuka> 13if you ride around as the prisoner with him, he gives you exposition
<Polydunami> Okay
<Quorl_Changeling> ...
<Shizuka> 13see he's not looking so i can change here
<Polydunami> Well, that's kind of funny
<Polydunami> Doesn't even question how the blind man can swim
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> second class citizen on an Utopia dosen't seem so bad
<Shizuka> 13not to mention how he hears no footsteps but suddenly there's a different guy there :3
<Polydunami> But it's a Utopia
<Shizuka> 13mst3k mantra everypony~

<Cades> alright night
<Shizuka> 13i love how you have infinite coins
<Kimori> night
<Shizuka> 13it's not replicating your inventory cause you lose some plot items
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka maybe he gave you change for your gold coin
<JRP|laptop> isent he from a tv show?
<Quorl_Changeling> It's awfully open with that information
<Garettbrony> the ferryman sounds like a male zecora
<Polydunami> Not quite the poet, though
<Shizuka> 13well you're both captures from outside atlantis
<Quorl_Changeling> HE expected that response from the blind guy.
<Quorl_Changeling> the "looks like a storm"
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> lol he gets lonely on the sea
<Shizuka> 13I MUST GO NOW, MY TIMELINE NEEDS ME
<SaxyPretender> 0,14XD

<Shizuka> 13duuuuuuude
<Quorl_Changeling> ^
<Polydunami> We're gettting all fired up, man.
<Panda|Drawing> So... thats what Shizuka sounds like?
<Panda|Drawing> JKJK
<Panda> so... in this game... you play as a changeling? O_o
<Polydunami> Pretty much, yeah
<Polydunami> You have to, because you are travelling through time.
<DeathStar> yay time travell
*Quorl_Changeling approves
<Polydunami> Right now, we're in Atlantis just before it gets destroyed :P
<Panda> Sylandest, DeathStar, doesnt the guy that Shizu is playing, sound kinda like Raja? O_o
<MadSurge> Panda: :D I would like to hear what Shizu sounds like though
<DeathStar> Panda: a little....
<Shizuka> 13well
<Shizuka> 13that's arthur the AI you're hearing
<DeathStar> Panda: I think if raja tried he would sound like that
<Polydunami> So was this blind beggar blinded as a punishment?
<Shizuka> 13probably
<Panda> MadSurge, her voice would make you blind from the awesome.
<Shizuka> 13he was with the temple but was cast out
<Polydunami> Yeah, I kind of figured that he was from the temple

<Panda> Darn him and his ability xD
<RoboGerbil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5NgLEP7vw0
<Polydunami> Wait, are you the unicorn?
<Polydunami> Right
<Panda> Yeah she is Polydunami
<Spectrum_Rush> Rose on the left, Violet on the right... I like the simbolism
<Polydunami> Then why do people say the facial expression should be switched?
<Shizuka> 13only meanwhile does
<Polydunami> Oh. Never mind then :D
<Shizuka> 13because meanwhile wants to be banned
<Panda> :O
<Panda> dont ban him!
<Rain> what, Shizuka?
<Polydunami> Yeah, Meanwhile is too much of a staple to just be banned willy nilly.
<Spectrum_Rush> now I wouldn't say that Shizuka its more http://i.imgur.com/0C2rJ.jpg?1
<Polydunami> Then again, rules.
<Rain> what did meanqhile do?
<Shizuka> 13trolling
<Spectrum_Rush> being meanwhile
<Shizuka> 13been getting worse all week
<Polydunami> Something he's not telling us or something?
<Rain> you'd think a warning would do right?
<Polydunami> For Meanwhile?
<Rain> because that is the exact reason I walked away for a while, Shizuka
<Panda> But, thats Meanwhile... He's always been like that.
<MadSurge> Doesn't justify being a jerk though :/
*Panda shrugs
<Rain> again
<Panda> He's been like that since the day I encountered him. It's just in his nature.
<Spectrum_Rush> wait shizu are you refering to those aquatic life pics he linked?
<Rain> a warning
<Polydunami> Or those... "icky bug things"?
<Shizuka> 13when told not to post the giant bugs or similar closeups he starts spamming sea life instead
<Shizuka> 13it's trolling
<Panda> Oh.
<Rain> Shizuka
<Rain> again
<Rain> a warning.
<MadSurge> ^
<Shizuka> 13ja
<RoboGerbil> www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7xEu5jabVw
<Polydunami> Well, if you want to use a warning, you'd have to be strict about it.
<MadSurge> Well I posted sealife too, am I officially warned too?
<Panda> MadSurge you werent the one warned hun
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: unless i missed something he posted the sealife first, then the bugs when someone in chat said they weren't scared of no sea life, and then back to sea life
<Shizuka> 13no he's always posted the bugs to get reactions out of people
<Shizuka> 13especially me
<MadSurge> Panda: darn my taste for the macabre :D
<Rain> like the giant bug eating the carrot?
<Shizuka> 13like that one
<Rain> but that bug is cute
<Polydunami> I don't know about you, but I find that picture cute. But to each his own.
<Panda> Maybe its just not her taste ^^
<RoboGerbil> anypony up for some left 4 dead 2?
<Polydunami> My sister is afraid of spiders.
<Panda> I usually ignore Meanwhile though. Except for the off chance that we are included in a discussion with one another.
<sub06905> for some reason i read that as: my people are afraid of spiders
<Panda> sub06905 XD
<Polydunami> Well, my sister counts as "people" so it works both ways :D
<Polydunami> But people is a more general term
<sub06905> strange.... i must be getting tired
<Polydunami> Even more strange, it's ten to one in the morning and I'm still not quite so tired yet.
<Polydunami> Then again, I'm used to being up this late :P
<Panda> Polydunami /) PST Brohoof!
<MadSurge> Polydunami: my brother too, although he's gotten better over the years
<Polydunami> Panda /)
<Polydunami> Yeah, sometimes I'm better with the time but lately, I've been going to bed later.
<Panda> Polydunami no schooling for you ^^
<Polydunami> Oh yeah, it's October now
<Panda> O_o october FEST!
<Polydunami> Yeah, no school. Just pure and utter boredom :S
<Shizuka> 13oh good my GPU temperature sensor is broken
<Shizuka> 13it thinks it's -999C
<Panda> O_o
<sub06905> lol
<RoboGerbil> that absoulte zero
<Panda> Nitrogen cooling system?
<RoboGerbil> you could overclock the crap out of that thing
<Polydunami> Pfft. Absolute zero is disproven xD
<Shizuka> 13you can't get colder than -273C
<Panda> Antarctic I mean then.
<Shizuka> 13core temp is 56C
<Polydunami> Oh my
<Shizuka> 13i doubt the GPU is three times below absolute zero
<Panda> Thats about optimal levels though, right?
<Shizuka> 13not really
<Shizuka> 1350 is better, 45 even better
<Polydunami> So that's about 132-133 F
<Shizuka> 13below 40 is best
<Panda> hm... mine never runs below 40...
<Shizuka> 13above 60 is expected when asuka's working hard, above 70 is danger level
<Panda> im always at 45-55 C
<Shizuka> 1380 and above trigger overheat shutdowns
<Panda> Shizuka, not if you disable them. but I dont see who would want that.
<Shizuka> 13i need asuka to last many many many years
<Shizuka> 13cause i am not going back to kimiko with 2GB of ram and a barely functional GPU
<Shizuka> 13neither of which can be upgraded
<Panda> :/
<Panda> Oh man.
<Polydunami> Just a small question; how do you find your core temperature for your computer or laptop?
<Moopy> Im back and got me som oranges and some cut up apples and made some Peanut Butter sandwhich
<Panda> So, asuka is the most powerful of the three machines Shizuka?
<Shizuka> 13coretemp
<Shizuka> 13http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/
<Shizuka> 13asuka's the most recent, october 2010
<Shizuka> 13kimiko is from 2008, server is from who knows when
<Panda> Polydunami coretemp or speedfan work good... though there are quite a bit of programs that monitor the temp of your HDD's and GPU's
<MadSurge> Is Shizu the unicorn? :D
<Polydunami> Yeah
<Polydunami> So Shizuka is wide-eyed and Vivi is... I want to say seductive? I dunno :S
<Polydunami> Which reminds me; I haven't seen much of Vivi lately.
<Panda> Polydunami, correct. I wouldnt say seductive though.
<Polydunami> Maybe sly
<Shizuka> 13vivi's having hard drive problems
<MadSurge> Polydunami: her computer went belly up
<Panda> aww :(
<Polydunami> Dang
<Polydunami> That's a shame
<MadSurge> Shizuka: say hi to her for all of us :)
<Polydunami> Indeed
<Panda> Polydunami, I would just say older and more mature. Well, I'm basing this on the anime style drawing of eyes >.>
<Polydunami> Oh my
<OneTrickPony|homewor> good night but not yet morning everyone

<OneTrickPony|Mandari> has anyone here been on bronystate longer than a year?
<Moopy> Oh ok...............but whats wronge with P3ANUTSMUGGLER?
<OneTrickPony|Mandari> Moopy: too much all caps
<MadSurge> Personally, the all caps is bad
<Zuxxez123> Yeah, caps = eye sores.
<Moopy> oh ok then i won't do P3ANUTSMUGGLER then
<OneTrickPony|Mandari> does anyone remember who started bronystate?
<Zuxxez123> OneTrickPony|Mandari: OFF TO GOOGLE! :P
<OneTrickPony|Mandari> lol
<MadSurge> I think it might have been Ghosties OneTrickPony|Mandari
<Zuxxez123> It was just here, like the big bang.
<OneTrickPony|Mandari> ah yes SirSprinkles
<Zuxxez123> Just took humans a bit to find it from the rest of the sites.
<OneTrickPony|Mandari> I remember the good ol' days
<Zuxxez123> Good ol' days when Flash animation was the best thing to come into our lives.
