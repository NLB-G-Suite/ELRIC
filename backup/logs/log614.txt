<kirz|art> hehe :)
<Caramel> funny how you seem to be the only person to have problems with it otakon
<flutter_spin> or maybe it was "Dead Zone"
<Bronyhawk> BerryPunch must be running on Vista xD
<Canadian_Brony> "Merry Happy!" . . . WTF
<Canadian_Brony> Bronyhawk actually, Vista was updated so it's actually useable.
<flutter_spin> LOL
<Bronyhawk> Canadian_Brony: I know, but I still tease about it :P
<sub06905> mustache = not gay
<Canadian_Brony> Bronyhawk I'm on Vista and it's fine. TBH, I prefer it to XP
<Ponies47> Oh yeah. Now somepony on bronystate knows what I look like :3
<Eulshy> im lazy
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 it ain't me
<mitamaking> 65 to pass, he is going to get a D at best, bad student

<otakon> the hell is a laser lotus?
<Spectrum_Rush> ~OK EVERYPONY BerryPunch IS DRUNK AGAIN AND KICKING ANYPONY THATS SPEAKS A FEW TIMES, SO NOPONY TALK~
<mitamaking> *Agnostic
<Eulshy> Whats agnostic
<cowvarkian> heh... pastafarian
<mitamaking> Spectrum_Rush: got it
<Barbetos> Not believing a religion, but believing that there is a god Eulshy
<SirGanjalf> Me too, but you can treat me like atheist
<Ponies47> No problem Spectrum_Rush!
<otakon> no birthdays, no christmas, no blood transfusions
<Eulshy> So not Atheism
<otakon> no drinking
<otakon> the hell
<Buytoast> agnostic atheist is the only way to live
<Bronyhawk> Agnostic is the belief that there may or may be a God but it doesn't matter...basically that's what it is anyway
<Barbetos> Eulshy yes.
<mitamaking> Barbetos: Agnostic then
*Ponies47 Stands still and doesn't move a muscle
<OtakuTom> I was gonna say BP was running on Windows ME, but I thought that would be a little /too/ mean ^^;
<Barbetos> mitamaking the word used in the show, yes.
<Bronyhawk> may or may not*, rather
<otakon> OtakuTom: nothing is too mean for that goddamn bitch.
<Barbetos> Fuck it. Time to get so drunk I can't see straight.
<sub06905> true or falso
<superretroworld> xD
<oni_link> OtakuTom: or win2000 :D
<Unnr|AFK> OtakuTom: Windows 98 SE unpatched?
<SirGanjalf> Or even if there is a God, no one can really know his intentions.
<Canadian_Brony> Bronyhawk my computer came with Vista, my old one with XP. Vista has features that make it feel like XP while having the customization of 7. However, it's a RAM hog and I need a 64-bit version so I can upgrade it to 6GB
<mitamaking> During an exam? Kick him out of school
<Canadian_Brony> Bronyhawk that should let me play TF2 again
<OtakuTom> 2000 was better than ME...I should know from experience :P
<Reikim> Oh, otakon, BP is kicking you because she /likes/ you.
<oni_link> Canadian_Brony: why not step up to 7?
<Reikim> Don't you see?
<flutter_spin> "Dead Zone" ... gotta be
<otakon> Reikim: lovely
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.

<mitamaking> amigo means cousin?
<Canadian_Brony> oni_link in Vista and XP, you have the tabs for each window in your task bar. I prefer that to how it is in 7.
<oni_link> mitamaking: it means friend :D

<Bronyhawk> Canadian_Brony: Can't argue there. I have 7 Ultimate 64 kicking around though, so I'm kind of uninterested in trying other things :3
<otakon> bye pillo...damn gone
<SirGanjalf> stuff the menora into christmas tree...
<Reikim> I assume your logic is that, if there is a fourth wall in existence, then a Pinkie must exist to break it.
<mitamaking> :)
<kirzstryfe> yep

<otakon> hiya Ponies47

<thelonepony> hi Pudge
<Reikim> And Engineers everywhere curse their appearance.
<Shamroc> Phase4..playing?
<Pudge> what's on stream?
<PsychoticDoc> otakon: essentialy
<Cypresswolf> christianity shouldnt be forced - its a personal choice
<sub06905> ello Pudge
<Eulshy> it never mentions if they are male or female vergins
<Phase4> i like how the tf2 wiki page describes them: "Essentially a bomb on legs"
<flutter_spin> "Community"
<AJIsAwesome> Buytoast: That's not entirely true. I don't like hardcore christian and I'm christian.
<Phase4> Shamroc, at uni right now
<pony_2718> otacon go away ...
<linx> cowvarkian: that works
<oni_link> linx: ie why I don't like religion. My parents tried to hard and now I dont care
<Shamroc> ooh

<otakon> pony_2718: it's a joke
<mitamaking> I hate all hardcore religions, including atheist
<Bunny_Striker> JEFF IS BEST IMAGINARY FRIEND!!

<cowvarkian> .... since when is atheism a religion

<Canadian_Brony> it isn't
<otakon> pony_2718: besides my own personal view is the universe is far too vast and infinite for there NOT to be something beyond.
<Shamroc> indeed
<Pudge> atheism LITERALLY means lack of religion
<SirGanjalf> SUP?

<Reikim> They would go down like so much junk.
<Petrified_Discord> FIGHTING IS MAGIC

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Play us some Kitty0706 content Shizuka!!
<Phobos2390> LET'S DO IT!!!!!!
<thelonepony> and kablooey
<Kandarihu> Well, this guy's a better at being a demoman than I am at being a man.
<Barbetos> =(
<Phobos2390> yeah...guns and alcohol. really good mix
<Shizuka> 13note to self, there is a reason they invented fritos scoops...
<Canadian_Brony> I'm a black scottish cyclops! They got more ***** **** *** ** **** * ** then they got the likes of me.
<Barbetos> Phobos2390 I have never seen a problem with that.
<DerpStar> Phobos2390: ever hear about this thing called the military?
<Shizuka> 13this crap at the bottom of an original bag breaks apart before you even get any bean dip on..
<Malk> nevermind
<thelonepony> and they have to glew u back, in hell!!!!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> YAY Riftrax
<Spectrum_Rush> potter riff
<Shamroc> DAT RIFFTRAX
<Phobos2390> Wait. Harry Potter 1?
<Barbetos> I am so glad I don't have work tomorrow
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka I was thinking it was because people like edible spoons.
<AJIsAwesome> DAT RIFFTRAX
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> so much for sleep
<Canadian_Brony> Phobos2390 with Rifftrax!
<DerpStar> PaladinDrakkenwolf: you're on BS sleep is not possible
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can haz wizard? XD
<Kandarihu> For this, I can simply pause the video and go. For what Caramel streamed, I should've spoken out.
<Pudge> dont see how you can have a rifftrax for perfection but okay
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DerpStar: normally im in Steam when that happens
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: so whos the riffers for this one today?
<Canadian_Brony> I like that light-stealing-thingy
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<DerpStar> Ah yes steam
<Shizuka> 13all three
<Major> XD
<Canadian_Brony> Meatloaf
<Canadian_Brony> hah
<DerpStar> PaladinDrakkenwolf: I like CIV V on steam
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> DerpStar: TF2 and Borderlands for me
<DerpStar> While I pride myself on being a good FPS player TF2 isn't my cup of tea
<Barbetos> Dersleys better than the Kennedys? Seems legit.
<thelonepony> XD
<Major> :D
<Canadian_Brony> DerpStar I work on the exact opposite. I can only play TF2 . . . and borderlands.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ohhhh rifftrax
<Canadian_Brony> TheGreatAndPowerfulT eeyup
<thelonepony> the commentary is the best yet
<Kandarihu> I can't seem to work up the nerve to say what I have to say.
<Shizuka> 13this is a great series of riffs
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Kandarihu just do it, filly!
<Buytoast> damn i hate the actors in this one
<Pudge> goddammit, can i kick dudley's ass yet?
<Kandarihu> It would probably ruin the fun of the Rifftrax anyway.
<Unnr> Shizuka: Agreed, some of the best (but the The Room riff is still the best)
<Shizuka> 13THIRTEEN BUT LAST SEASON HAD TWENTY SIX PONIES
<oni_link> Ponies47: the first epi of the adventures of pootisman cracked me up, especially when the heavy started vogue-ing :D
<Buytoast> not their acting, but their goddamn annoying voices
<Barbetos> Shizu XD
<DerpStar> I would slap my child if he/she flipped like that
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shizuka: I know. Let's start a strong petition!
<Barbetos> I'll take whatever I can get, does that make me a whore
<Barbetos> ?
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka ah yes, but I can garuntee more seasons to come.
<superretroworld> this was my childhood movie
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Kandarihu http://derpy.me/dgTOG
<oni_link> Barbetos: a food whore. im guilty of that too >.>
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> pfft sloths
<AJIsAwesome> Nittany_Discord: Did people actually do that?
<Ponies47> oni_link: There's 4 episode's. They are old good :P

*Nittany_Discord 11,01levels Shizuka
<Barbetos> AJIsAwesome this is the internet. EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE! ANd before your think that is crazy there is a whole fandom that likes My Little Pony. Think on that.
<Pudge> Shizuka: indeed
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> yes
<Canadian_Brony> I went to a zoo not long after watching. I talked to a snake that was there.
<Kandarihu> Shizuka, wasn't he already Daniel Radcliffe?
<Spectrum_Rush> yeah kinda Shizuka
<oni_link> Shizuka: i couldnt see that back then
<Pudge> Shizuka: same thing with rupert and emma
<Shizuka> 13yeah but the specimen of manliness he is today
<Dismo> Shizuka: Someone has a crush.
<Major> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: so what was that about laughing your ass of if I went scout? :3
<DerpStar> Doesn't do it for me Shizuka
<oni_link> Ponies47: any other stuff on youtube worth checking out?
<Spectrum_Rush> oh u Shizuka
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Major LMAO, there
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos: I know. I was just hoping that people wouldn't do something as dreadful as this.
<Unnr> Rupert Grint > Daniel Radcliffe
<Major> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: I did it for you :3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01500 lb lol.
<Major> XD
<oni_link> hahaha
<Pudge> Matthew Lewis>all
<Ponies47> oni_link: Pootis-MAN is they only thing that I found recently and I want to see streamed on Bronystate. Sometimes wrek does a long run of random Gmod video's the Pootis-Man videos would be perfect! XD
<Shizuka> 13nice hat, give you two buds for it!
<Ponies47> *the
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Winner!
<DerpStar> 1 bit
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka only two?
<Major> Shizuka: Ill give him 5!

<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka that's not worth one bill ...
<XylemTube> AWE YEAAAH MST3K
<Shizuka> 13owl wranglin
<Ponies47> oni_link: IKR? I should suggest those to Wrek the next time I see him :P
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka I'll only agree with you on the fact that Dudlee is wearing it.
<DerpStar> I like Cardigans
<Kencolt> Just checking in, but... Owl City?
<Canadian_Brony> Kencolt Philosipher's Stone with Rifftrax
<Shizuka> 13no post on sundays >3<
<oni_link> Ponies47: heck yeah! i love gmod vids :P
<Pudge> seriously guys http://derpy.me/6wN5m
<Kencolt> I know that. you missed my riff.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shotgun. The perfect spam filter.
<oni_link> NO BLASTED LETTUCE TODAY
<Canadian_Brony> "No post on sundays" they said. "No bloody post today!" they said.
<Ponies47> oni_link: They can be so random :P
<Barbetos> Pudge XDDDDD
<Canadian_Brony> all dat spam!
<Pudge> Barbetos: how do you go from that to THAT
<Barbetos> How can a single image have so much win
<oni_link> Ponies47: I know, thats why I like them :D
<Shizuka> 13Canadian_Brony: yeah but this is the first one, they couldn't quasi-swear yet
<DerpStar> No spam filter?
<Pudge> I'm pretty sure a lot of guys would go gay for neville
<Major> Not me :P
<Kencolt> And SOMEHOW Vernon keeps him from reading ANY of them. Gotta give Vernon props for that.
<Canadian_Brony> DerpStar they tried and failed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Danielle Radcliffe is so young in this.
<Kandarihu> You know what? I should've made this announcement while Caramel was streaming Community. He's not even on anymore. And it wouldn't be fair to Shizuka if my announcement wrecks the fun of HER stream. I'm just going to take Bronystate and Ponychat off my domain block for the time being. If it happens again tomorrow night, that will be the time to make the announcement.
<Shizuka> 13X3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01XD
<DerpStar> Canadian_Brony: clearly
<Pudge> Kandarihu: um...
<Pudge> Kandarihu: sorry but what are you talking about
<Ponies47> oni_link: I do like SFM but I find Gmod classic. For some video's like Painis Cupcake video's. His ways of moving around can not be re-created in SFM.
<Shizuka> 13unfortunately this riff comes after their spiderman riff and xmen riff, so they occasionally reference those
<Barbetos> Kandarihu cryptic.
<Canadian_Brony> Elmer Fudd rifle
<Canadian_Brony> is best rifle
<DerpStar> Cake
<Barbetos> Not really.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Barbetos not sure if that was the announcement
<Shizuka> 13wait
<Pinkies4thWall> Yay shhizustream
<Shizuka> 13raspberry frosting?
<Major> XD
<Shizuka> 13GIVE ME THAT CAKE NOW
<Kandarihu> I REALLY hope it doesn't come to committing to it. Not really announcing anything now.
<Dovah> and good night everypony
<MirrorImage> Penguin would kill for that umbrella
<oni_link> Ponies47: I think Gmod is for wackier stuff imo and SFM is for professional looking stuff although they remade a lot of gmod stuff in SFM
<AJIsAwesome> Dovah: Night!
*Canadian_Brony gives Shizuka a cake with raspberry frosting
<thelonepony> nit Dovah
<DerpStar> I turned 11 in 1994 ^_^
<Barbetos> I know the cake to bake for Shizuka. Whens your birday exactly?
<Ponies47> Good night Dovah sleep well
<Major> Shizuka: I can make you a strawberry cake with rasberry frosting if you want :3
<Phobos2390> I know nothing of swine dermatology
<Kencolt> Hi, Dudley now proves he has NO REDEEMING QUALITIES WHATEVER.
<Shizuka> 13Barbetos: may 22 >>
<AJIsAwesome> Your a Harry, wizard.
<Ponies47> oni_link: Yeah. SFM odes look great but Gmod is always still awesome :3
<AJIsAwesome> *you're*
<oni_link> night Dovah
<Buytoast> Dudley is actually the best Dursley.
<Canadian_Brony> Yu Gi Oh over wizarding?
<Pudge> ♪I'm Harry Freakin Potter♪
<DerpStar> Night Dovah !
<Barbetos> I wonder what the odds are of picking a random address and then hoping it ends up at your home if I order it at a local bakery.
<Kencolt> Buytoast: Which is VERY VERY disturbing.
<Ponies47> My birthday is December 6th :P
<oni_link> Ponies47: vagineers :D
<Canadian_Brony> Barbetos very unlikely
<Barbetos> Horribly romantic notion, but it would be fucking insane if it happened. =P
<Barbetos> ^ my weakness.
<Shizuka> 13now that we've all seen it
<Ponies47> oni_link: meD rseenigav yeht era os deriw
<Shizuka> 13shouldn't petunia have noted that lily met SNAPE and not just potter?
<oni_link> wait, there was lightning indoors, did anyone else notice that!!!!!!!
<Buytoast> she couldn't tell them
<Buytoast> apart
<Dismo> Shizuka: >:l Oh, thanks.
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: roling hadnt thought that far ahead yet :S
<Shizuka> 13possibly
<Barbetos> Shizu and there lies the truth. Rowling did not think that far ahead at this point obviously.
<Shizuka> 13book was out in like 1999 wasn't it?
<oni_link> Ponies47: hahaha totally XD
<Phobos2390> lol
<Spectrum_Rush> *Rowling
<Ponies47> oni_link: IKR? :p
<Kencolt> Usenet? Does that even EXIST anymore?
<Unnr> Kencolt: yes, yes it does
<Canadian_Brony> Spectrum_Rush Shizuka she planned out the entire series with index cards before she started even the first book
<Barbetos> ALTHOUGH! I think the script could of been fixed a bit for it.
<Kencolt> Is it used?
<Barbetos> SO she had not thought of it then either
<Barbetos> GAPS!
<Unnr> Yes
<Canadian_Brony> Barbetos most likely
<Unnr> alt.sysadmin.recovery still has a pretty large poster-base
<Canadian_Brony> Barbetos minor plot hole. Besides, she's a lying bitch. What do you expect?
<Major> XD
<Shizuka> 13well we know by this point she had snape's role laid out since she told alan rickman about it
<Shizuka> 13by the movie that is
<oni_link> and the snorty spies o,o Ponies47
<vCades> yo yo yo wuddup
<Ponies47> oni_link: Oh yeah dem to :P
<oni_link> Ponies47: crabspies :o
<Ponies47> O.O
<MirrorImage> Professor Foamy T. Sqirrel
<Canadian_Brony> he's a celebrity and he doesn't even know it
<Shizuka> 13another point but mostly cause i don't remember
<Shizuka> 13do we ever learn quirrel's first name?
<Major> Shizuka: Nope :P
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka not that I recall
<Buytoast> Samuel
<Buytoast> professor S. Quirrel
<Unnr> Quirinus
<XylemTube> I love riftrax!
<Unnr> Seriously, Quirinus Quirrell
<Dismo> I always that quirrel was just... a made up body, or something, not a heal host.
<Major> D
<Dismo> real*
<MirrorImage> yep, it's "Quirinus" according to the hp wikia
<Shizuka> 13that's.... lame
<Canadian_Brony> Diagon Alley is so traditional
<Spectrum_Rush> dats Aliteration
<Canadian_Brony> Nimh
<XylemTube> I do with that the Movie would quiet down when they commentate
<Shizuka> 13hopefully i will find time to run chamber of secrets tomorrow
<XylemTube> wish even
<VenHur> We're watching Harry Potter...again? xd
<VenHur> *XD
<Canadian_Brony> VenHur with Rifftrax
<Barbetos> Quirinus?
<Barbetos> Really?
<Major> XD
<Barbetos> This is his first name?
<Barbetos> wtf?
<Unnr> Its a traditional saint's name
<Barbetos> Well... That is kind of like my real name
<Barbetos> I guess
<pony_1654> What's up with the intermittent robot voice?
<Shizuka> 13that's Disembaudio
<Canadian_Brony> "Safest place besides Hogwarts". Gets successfully infiltrated by 3 17-year-olds.
<XylemTube> pony_1654: it's to sync the Audio with the video
<pony_1654> ah
<Phobos2390> DUUUDE!!!
<Shizuka> 13a rifftrax is an mp3 you play in sync with a movie, disembaudio echoes lines so you know if you're lined up
<Shizuka> 13this is a presynced video, it just doesn't have dis removed
<Kandarihu> I gotta restart my computer. I'll be back.
<Dismo> Shizuka: I have the nametag for you....
<Shizuka> 13pretty sure most of the others remove dis
<Canadian_Brony> seeya Kandarihu
<Barbetos> dis?
<Barbetos> wut?
<Major> @_@
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Canadian_Brony well howarts is not that safe anyway i mean all years there is some evil lurking there
<Unnr> Shizuka: most actually keep dis in
<Major> ALL DA GOLD! @_@
<Shizuka> 13well most of the other harry potters
<Canadian_Brony> TheGreatAndPowerfulT IKR? 7 years in a row!
<XylemTube> Oh god they mentioned the Crystal Skull
<Reikim|Drawing> Law of Narrative Coincidence. Hogwarts is usually safe...but a "safe" year at Hogwarts would make for a really boring story.
<VenHur> I would continue to watch the Rifftrax version of this film, but it's 12 AM where I lives...maaaybe tomorrow?
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim|Drawing IKR?
<Unnr> Harry Potter: Totally Hacked the Gibson
<Shizuka> 13noooob

<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord seems legit
<AJIsAwesome> Biglaw: Hi!
<Major> Nittany_Discord: I would actually like to have that wand :D
<Canadian_Brony> MirrorImage ahead or behind?
<MirrorImage> ahead
<Unnr> Is it just me, or this Ollivander sort of looks like some of the incarnations of The Master?
<Barbetos> Hello Biglaw
<Canadian_Brony> No no and defenitely not.
<Biglaw> :3
<Barbetos> In the book didn't they go through ALL the wands?
<MirrorImage> right now Harry Potter is going all super and glowy for me
<Barbetos> oh that sounds so bad...
<oni_link> I would, Sawyer > Kid Rock
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Lol.
<Shizuka> 13Barbetos: yes but movie time
<Biglaw> XD
<Biglaw> Three sizes
<Canadian_Brony> Barbetos I haven't read it in . . . forever.
<Shizuka> 13you'd have to fade to some time later with piles of boxes and that would just be pointless
<Barbetos> suddenly dic chaney XD
<Biglaw> >.<
<Canadian_Brony> it's a conspiramacy!
<Shizuka> 13the thing about ollivander's character is he's not necessarily on the side of good
<Biglaw> It's an elaborate ruse!
<Phobos2390> In the wizarding world, wand choose you.
<Biglaw> Soviet Diagon Alley*
<Shizuka> 13iirc in the last book he's a bit proud of giving voldemort the wand he did, despite what voldemort went on to do with it
<thelonepony> theres no conspiramacy>_>
<Barbetos> Ah. the benefit of true neutral.
<DerpStar> Well its getting late and hubby just got home so I'm off to bed
<Shizuka> 13pretty much
<Phobos2390> In soviet diagon alley, owl turn you into ps3

<Biglaw> SHADDUP KID
*DerpStar hugs Canadian_Brony night hun
<Biglaw> The Dark Side? He was Vader?
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: Shag?
<Barbetos> Hagrid is pretty non chalant about saying his name at this part
<Canadian_Brony> g'night DerpStar
<Barbetos> seems.. off
<Shizuka> 13EH SHE'LL BE FINE
<Barbetos> it bothers me
<Major> XD
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Spectrum_Rush: That's how you pronounce it.
<Shizuka> 13vvt
<AJIsAwesome> DerpStar: Night!
<Biglaw> >.<
<Shizuka> 13if this were a less... serious... ish... series
<Shizuka> 13they'd pronounce it VVT for the rest of the series
<Canadian_Brony> LoLz
<oni_link> so who do i have to thank for the current stream?
<Shizuka> 13not the wimpy "you know who"
<Biglaw> Shizuka: Just like Vampire's s
<Biglaw> Suck*
<VenHur> So, who the guy in the commentary?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Connecticut towns
<Phobos2390> in soviet wizarding world, toad have you
<Shizuka> 13more plotholes!
<Unnr> Nittany_Discord: He who must not be named is really named a';DROP TABLE users .... if they name him, every wizard looses their name due to a vunerability in magic's kernel....
<Shizuka> 13well
<Shizuka> 13unless hagrid can teleport
<Phobos2390> In soviet wizarding world, ticket stick to you
<Biglaw> inception forghorn
<Major> XD
<Shizuka> 13but they snapped his wand so he's not allowed magic
<Kingman725> harry potter forever alone
<Barbetos> your comments are so far ahead of what I am seeing. It confuseseseseses me
<Shizuka> 13that would imply hagrid has to take the hogwarts express
<XylemTube> Did he just say Owlicious?
<Shizuka> 13but he gets there before harry
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - apparition doesn't require a wand that i know of
<Barbetos> esesesesessesesesese
<Buytoast> maybe he has a portkey in his beard
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Or maybe his name is an SQL injection command.
<Barbetos> hah
<Buytoast> to return home
<MirrorImage> though given Hagrid's size, it would imply a hell of a "snap"
<Shizuka> 13MirrorImage: yeah but it's also a case that hagrid's pretty much not allowed to do magic
<Dismo> Shizuka: No He has that moter cycle, no?
<Unnr> Magic, the largest SQL database ever
<Shizuka> 13he *can* but he shouldn't
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka he has a motorcycle that flies, and we know they can go from London to Hogwarts if you fly
<Dismo> motor*
<Unnr> How else do you explain all the bad latin?
<Shizuka> 13might be the motorcycle..
<Biglaw> How does nobody notice this going on?!?!
<Dismo> The Motorcycle is my best guess.
<Phobos2390> Honestly woman, you call yourself our mother?
<Shizuka> 13by this point sirius would be in azkaban though so
<Unnr> Biglaw: magic, duh!
<Major> Okay, how the hell do the regular people NOT see this?!
<Biglaw> Unnr: :I
<Shizuka> 13would that mean hagrid just has the motorcycle now?
<pony_2718> :D
<Biglaw> Major: That's what I'm saying!
<Barbetos> Shizuka he carries around his wand all the time though, so it is not to far of a stretch that he does use magic all the time
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: yeah he never gave it back
<Canadian_Brony> Shizuka perhaps he can retrieve it, or he parked it in London.
<Biglaw> NEVAR!
<Kingman725> YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
<MirrorImage> LEEEEROY
<Biglaw> JEEEENKINNNS
<Phobos2390> In soviet wizarding world, wall run into you.
<Buytoast> I'm telling you
<Canadian_Brony> Phobos2390 *through
<Major> Biglaw: really! How are they not seeing that?! Theyre doing it right in their faces!
<Buytoast> he hides a portkey in his beard
<Barbetos> This is not a Lucas film,
<Shizuka> 13oh and i have to apologize way way in advance, but the fellowship of the ring riff totally has disembaudio right smack in the middle of YOU SHALL NOT PASS
<Shizuka> 13it's lame and a half
<Canadian_Brony> Major Deception Magic
<Phobos2390> In soviet wizarding world, train ride you
<Barbetos> You know I have never actually noticed a Harry Potter toy.
<VenHur> In Soviet Internet, you is internet meme.
<Shizuka> 13i remember hogwarts express toys
<Major> AND HOW THE HELL IS THE TRAIN NEVER SEEN?!
<superretroworld> Barbetos: there was alot of merchandise after this movie
<Unnr> I remember the lego set being the only one that was ever in stock
<Biglaw> XD
<Shizuka> 13Major: pocket dimension
<Shizuka> 13only way
<Dismo> Shizuka: ARE YOU EXCITED FOR THE HOBBIT?
<Barbetos> I missed it I guess.
<Canadian_Brony> Major . . . how can they not see Hogwarts?
<Buytoast> did anyone else have that harry poter levitation obstacle course game?
<Biglaw> PIMP MAH POTTER
<Biglaw> Lo
<Buytoast> because that was the shit
<Biglaw> :p
<Major> Shizuka: what Canadian_Brony said
<Shizuka> 13at some point the train would be deposited onto a line that's maybe discontinued
<AJIsAwesome> Biglaw: :D
<Canadian_Brony> Does the trolley sell muffins?
<Biglaw> Oh mai
<Reikim|Drawing> The train is never seen because MAGIC.
<Shizuka> 13well the school they explain as having a metric ton of charms and such to make muggles suddenly remember important appointments and stay away
<Phobos2390> spinach, liver, tripe, bogey, vomit, semen
<Biglaw> ewww
<pony_2718> xD
<Kingman725> LOL
<VenHur> Lol
<pony_2718> can you torrent this shit ?
<Reikim|Drawing> Look, if anyone complains about any inconsistancy ever again, the default response is MAGIC.
<Malk> I did my first draft of barbie girl parody everypony
<Shizuka> 13Reikim|Drawing: snort snort?
<Reikim|Drawing> If not MAGIC, then CONVENIENCE
<Reikim|Drawing> Snort snort indeed
<Buytoast> kill the rat now
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim|Drawing I'll think of something.
<Buytoast> save the world
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Canadian_Brony> Reikim|Drawing trust me.
<Biglaw> Reikim|Drawing: What about science in the wizardry world?
<Major> Shizuka: Then how do the regular people not see them going through the platform? :P
<Reikim|Drawing> MAGIC
<Shizuka> 13i see what you mean, you don't see her growing into emma watson either
<Shizuka> 13ron's mostly there though
<Canadian_Brony> fail spell
<pony_2718> xD
<Biglaw> XD
<Reikim|Drawing> Magic, people. The number 1 way of explaining things. In a sci-fi series, feel free to substitute MAGIC with SCIENCE.
<Unnr> A hurdy-gurdy spell would be awesome, does it come with monkey?
<Malk> oni_link you there?
<Reikim|Drawing> Major: MAGIC.
<Shizuka> 13Major: timing, although normal people in the harry potter universe must come equipped with extra stupidity that they don't notice anything
<Buytoast> holy cricket

<Canadian_Brony> for magic and science
<Reikim|Drawing> It's called a GLAMOUR. Often used by FAIRIES in fantasy settings. Makes us muggles ignore things we're not supposed to see.

<Unnr> what in the who what now? Why are the americans re-making the Inbetweeners?

<Shizuka> 13all in all it's just a nether brick in the wall
*Biglaw happily noms on granola bars :3

<Barbetos> That is where Malfoy offers his "friendship" right?
<VenHur> Oh look, it's the TrollHat.
<Canadian_Brony> Barbetos I don't remember. I just know they met first in Diagon Alley.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Major: Yes.
<Biglaw> My Little Malfoy: Backstab is Magic
<Reikim|Drawing> The only thing that annoyed me about the Potter series was that they never got into the mechanics of inventing spells. They were always pre-made.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And we'll end world hunger.
<Shizuka> 13the forbidden forest, forbidden to all students except always
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And end war forever.
<VenHur> Nittany_Discord: And free puppies for everyone?
<Shizuka> 13they should have alphabetized this list
<Reikim|Drawing> The Forbidden Forest: Forbidden unless you're a protagonist, then we'll find EVERY excuse to throw you in there.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01And kitties.
<Barbetos> that logic both makes perfect sense and also hurts my brain.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Their choice.
<Shizuka> 13give you six keys for that hat
<Spectrum_Rush> wasnt it in the book Shizuka ?
<Major> Shizuka: Seven :3

<Biglaw> Or one million years dungeon Nittany_Discord
<Shizuka> 13Unnr: that makes so much sense... my god...
<Shizuka> 13could be worse i suppose

*Pinkies4thWall hugs and brushes Nittany_Discord
<Shizuka> 13they could be insertion sorting them..
<Biglaw> Nittany_Discord: For the weasly~
<Shizuka> 13the rest of the next two hours would be them moving every student back one to make room
<Barbetos> And now I am imagining the sorting hat eating a hot pocket.
<Barbetos> that would be so messy
<Biglaw> awesome ^

<Unnr> Horray for wizard logic!
<Canadian_Brony> seems legit
<PillowPoni> Unnr: Troll in the dungeon? Better send the students to their dorms, IN THE DUNGEON.
<MirrorImage> PillowPoni - in all fairness, how many dungeons does Hogwarts have?
<MirrorImage> wood door protect me!
<NocturnalBlade> MirrorImage: ummm 5?
<Unnr> MirrorImage: but he never did say *which* dungeon the troll was in
<Canadian_Brony> MirrorImage I don't think the troll is an alien, so that could pose a problem
<PillowPoni> MirrorImage: To be honest, I have no clue. I would presume a few. Hufflepuff and Slytherin's common rooms are located near the dungeons

<Barbetos> Troll bogey is gross, but the idea of a very VERY young harmonie leading on a troll is okay
<Biglaw> inb4 Dteven Spielberg directs a harry potter sequel

<OtakuTom> I'm looking forward to the day that personal jetpacks are a thing...something like Quidditch will quickly become real...lol
<MirrorImage> OtakuTom - actually, going back to that "Pod Race Scene" reference...
<MirrorImage> evidently someone's made the equivalent of a Star Wars hover-cycle from the forest scene
<Biglaw> o.o
<Biglaw> MirrorImage: That's called a speeder
<MirrorImage> sure - that thing
<OtakuTom> Yea, I've seen speeder bike replicas
<Biglaw> :3
<MirrorImage> haven't seen a star wars movie to completion anyways
<MirrorImage> OtakuTom - that actually hovers?
<Biglaw> MirrorImage: You're joking, right
<Biglaw> ?
<MirrorImage> eenope
<Biglaw> :O
<Sabershy> Hello everypony. :)
<Buytoast> are there no faouls or something?
<Buytoast> holy shit
<Biglaw> Hai Sabershy!
<NocturnalBlade> hi Sabershy
<princess> why is harry just sitting there watching them get fluffed up
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - mind if a post a link?
<OtakuTom> I haven't seen one that hovers on it's own, of course.
<princess> finally
<Shizuka> 13link? :<
<Shizuka> 13but
<Shizuka> 13movie
<MirrorImage> why i'm asking
<Malk> where did you get this from?
<MirrorImage> but come on! actually hovering star wars speeder!
<Biglaw> MirrorImage: Do want :3
<MirrorImage> or at least that's the pop culture reference people compare it to
<MirrorImage> burritos, obviously
<MirrorImage> wow... that's an old reference
<Biglaw> XD
<princess> brb
<Sumica> 00,10who killed chat? Was it snape?
<Biglaw> Snape, snape, serverus snape
<MirrorImage> Netius Spliticus
<tSparx> chat liveth
<Ponies47> Sumica: No it was me :$
<NocturnalBlade> Biglaw: Dumbldor
<Biglaw> Even more appropriate than Wizard Monopoly

<princess> Malk:/) bro hoof ^^
<Biglaw> XD
<princess> NocturnalBlade: thnx
<tSparx> Ooh, I'd like a half-eaten box of Poki~
<NocturnalBlade> damn it now i want some Poki lol
<Barbetos> ^
<Unnr> Was anyone else dissapointed that the cloak didn't look like woven quicksilver?
<Malk> not me unnr
<Barbetos> Unnr that in the book or something?
<princess> not me either Unnr
<NocturnalBlade> HEY-O
<tSparx> I just remember it looking much better in theatres xD
<Unnr> Yeah, that's how it was described to look
<MirrorImage> Unnr - in all fairness, how many people actually know what "woven quicksilver" is supposed to look like?
<Barbetos> What does quickslver look like anyways? Silver?
<MirrorImage> ^ case in point
<Unnr> Barbetos: Mercury
<Biglaw> Barbetos: Maybeh
<Malk> I think
<tSparx> It's silver mercury
<Shizuka> 13the music here reminds me of doom 3
<Shizuka> 13i expect betruger cackling any second
<Malk> >_>
<tSparx> <_<
<princess> he ment to drop the lanterren >_>
<Unnr> http://periodictable.com/Samples/080.14/s9s.JPG < quicksilver
<tSparx> ^_^
<Malk> I agree Girls DORM NOW OR I TAKE YOUR MAN CARD
<MirrorImage> oh look! Quirrel in a Quarrel
<OtakuTom> That doesn't happen until at least year 5...he's still 11 right now and probably still believes in cooties :P
<MirrorImage> *badumtish8
<Ponies47> All this Christmas stuff is making me think about what I want for Christmas. It takes me FOREVER to decide! D:
<Shizuka> 13filch's defining characteristic, irritation at students not sleeping
<Barbetos> Good thing this takes place in the 80s? No cell phone for kids back then
<Barbetos> Cell phones and wizards...
<Barbetos> my god
<MirrorImage> Barbetos - ...that makes shockling much sense
<MirrorImage> i always thought of HP as relatively modern - 2000 or so
<tSparx> But it's not!
<Barbetos> It may even be the 70s
<Malk> cell phones give cancer thats what the mbc tells me
<tSparx> In the 6th (yes?) book, it's revealed that Harry was born in like the late 80's
<Barbetos> The Ford in the next book kind of gives away the time line
<Shizuka> 13like 87
<Malk> fox news tells me that everyone whos a democrat lives in newyork
<Shizuka> 13the series kicks off in 1998 or so
<MirrorImage> so then this movie takes place in 98?
<tSparx> Yeah
<tSparx> Yep!
<MirrorImage> poor kids... growing up on Windows 98
<tSparx> bwahaha
<MirrorImage> some of them even had to suffer through 95!
<tSparx> I just remember 3.1, hahaha
<Malk> hey 95 was a great year
<Biglaw> Shizuka: And then harry threw a nokia at Voldemort and he was killed, the end
<Shizuka> 13that was one of the goofs, when the millenium bridge blows up in half blood prince, the bridge hadn't been built yet for when the movie should have taken place
<MirrorImage> tSparx - as do i
<Barbetos> If he was born in 87 he would be 11 around 97.
<Unnr> First year is 1991
<tSparx> When Solitaire was the most complex thing you ever though computers could do
<Barbetos> WINDOWS 97! I dunno why I needed to type that...
<Barbetos> So 81?
<Barbetos> WINDOWS NE!
<OtakuTom> I got to experience the epicness that was 3.1, then the miserable failure of 95, the slightly better 98, the god-awful 2000 and ME...lol
<Barbetos> or something
<Shizuka> 13really?
<MirrorImage> OtakuTom - i pity you. i got to skip from 98 to xp
<Shizuka> 13win2k was their best work
<tSparx> And of course I have no idea what Apple was doing back then >_>
*MirrorImage prepares the torches and pitchforks for Shizuka
<The_Browncoat> Wiki say Harry was born 31 July, 1980.
<Shizuka> 1395 and 98 were phenomenal for what they made standard, despite being only graphical shells on top of dos
<Shizuka> 13now millenium edition
<Shizuka> 13that was horrible
<Shizuka> 13hands down, no contest, wipe it from history horrible
<princess> brb ima see if roblox is still updateing
<OtakuTom> I never had any good experiences with 2000, but never had it on a PC of my own, so that was probably why.
<Unnr> win98SE was amazingly good... after it was fully patched
<Shizuka> 13win2k is why XP is so hard to unseat in the enterprise now
<OtakuTom> I did have a PC with ME..and bloody hell that thing was a huge mess.
<Shizuka> 13companies waited FOREVER to upgrade to XP from win2k
<tSparx> zAmen haa
<Shizuka> 13and now from that inertia it's hard to push them to 7
<princess> whoa everything is empty i guess rolox is huanted
<Barbetos> I watched Toy Soldiers earlier today, and in that movie they show a CRT monitor with IE 5 or something.
<Barbetos> Also an advanced military proccessor in that movie had 600 mhz Xd
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - as i understood it, the general consensus was simply "Vista sucks, don't use it"
<MirrorImage> and from there, there was roughly 10 years of momentum behind XP
<tSparx> I love how this ties itself in *way* later in the series
<Malk> Barbatos I have a original Major Chiphazard action figure Barbetos
<Shizuka> 13vista failed so hard because OEMs didn't keep on top of the drivers fast enough
<Shizuka> 13nvidia especially
<Unnr> Shizuka: but nvidia has always been bad at keeping on top of drivers
<Shizuka> 13ja
<Shizuka> 13but especially for vista's launch
<OtakuTom> The funny part is, I had a better experience with the beta version of Vista than the official release.
<Unnr> yah
<Barbetos> Not to mention that system builders had to deal with the fact that thye had to renew their liscense if they used it so many times iwth vista
<Shizuka> 13nvidia screwed that up so hard that it blew vista's momentum
<MirrorImage> Hasbro makes a Sorcerer Stone?
<Shizuka> 13once the service packs were out vista was pretty rock solid
<MirrorImage> S3 spoilers?
<Unnr> its roughly the fact that windows makes a big mistake roughly every-other release
<tSparx> Gotta admit, Windows 7 is really incredible. Who would've imagined that OS's could *do* that in just a decade!
<Unnr> then goes and fixes the problems with the next one
<Unnr> tSparx: anyone that uses Linux?
<Barbetos> Dead Poet Society is another movie I want to see here
<MirrorImage> "Oh."
<MirrorImage> "Well... crap"
<tSparx> I dual-boot Ubuntu, a scratch project I'm working on, and Windows 7
<Shizuka> 13linux is still most at home in server land
<princess> inorder to get in his house just say " we know about the sorcerers stone"
<Shizuka> 13it's going to take the gaming community and probably a strongly managed distro to unseat windows in the desktop market though
<tSparx> Very, very true, *but*, if you're patient and willing to learn about computers, they're a great daily OS too.
<Unnr> True, but Linux has been great at showing exactly how fast an OS can change
<MirrorImage> ahaha
<Shizuka> 13linux changes fast but it also has severe usability issues coming from its unix heritage
<MirrorImage> and there's the WinME reference
<Shizuka> 13like single programs being scattered in four different places
<Shizuka> 13package management is great and all but you shouldn't need that much black box automation
<Unnr> POSIX advantage, everythings a file, but it also is one of the biggest weaknesses
<tSparx> It's great though, because they promise to support old editions of Ubuntu, so if the OS goes a way you don't like, you don't need to worry about it, just wait.
<OtakuTom> I've used Ubuntu and Mint, really liked both, but had a lot of problems with trying to get compatibility with my different windows-based games, even with WINE.
<Malk> y no MLP refences?
<Unnr> case in point, the ageing, horribleness that is x11
<Barbetos> Malk ikr
<Shizuka> 13for me and debian at least, i do like that you never need a restart except for kernel upgrades
<Barbetos> No one catches the "not the bees"
<Malk> I want MLP refrences
<Malk> Mabye it was made before hand
<Shizuka> 13Malk: this is like 2007
<Shizuka> 13FIM wasn't a think
<tSparx> Oh yeah, I'll never get *rid* of my Windows partition, because it's the best for gaming. But I wanna switch the day-to-day to Linux this Fall
<tSparx> Malk Peanut-Butter Pony Time (a totally Pinkie line)
<Shizuka> 13i tried making ubuntu my main on laptop.. it failed miserably..
<Unnr> Linux, like most FOSS software, suffers from a lack of high-end designers
<Unnr> there is a serious lack of well designed, logical User Interface decisions
<Shizuka> 13more like consistency... it's all POSIX standard but you don't have consistent direction across critical packages for the OS
<OtakuTom> Yea, dual-boot win/linux would be a good idea. At least Steam is coming to Linux soon...that'll really help the push for more gaming on the platform.
<Shizuka> 13i remember wrestling for hours trying to get it to accept the wifi card
<Shizuka> 13and that was before i spent a day and a half trying to get it to admit that, while crappy, the intel integrated chip is in fact 3d acceleration
<Unnr> wifi has come quite a long way in the last year or so
<tSparx> Oh, I'm so excited about that!
<OtakuTom> All my hardware worked out of the box on Linux Mint when I used it...well...except for the Nvidia card...I really think they need to come out with support for it instead of being asshats about it.
<NocturnalBlade> noooo, not unicorn blood!
<Barbetos> Unicorn blood looks more like quicksilver
<Shizuka> 13mint is descended from debian right?
<Shizuka> 13so far out of the distro families i've tried i like debian the best
<MASF123> Oh it's a repeat.
<OtakuTom> Mint is derived from Ubuntu, which is derived from Debian, IIRC.
<Unnr> OtakuTom: yep
<Unnr> Debian is nice, because debian is stable
<Unnr> things get really ugly when you start getting into experimental trees, like gentoo
<OtakuTom> Yea, I've had no issues with Mint or Ubuntu (minus the aformentioned problems trying to get windows games to work)
<Shizuka> 13if i had another box available i'd try running a desktop linux again
<MrEvergreen> How about ArchLinux?
<Metronome> Wht's with the commentary???
<Barbetos> Rifftrax Metronome
<Shizuka> 13but asuka's not giving up win7 any time soon, and haruko's too small to do more than headless debian
<Unnr> MrEvergreen: they recently moved away from an integrated installation framework, so its not very beginner friendly
<Metronome> Ok
<MrEvergreen> Well they did intend for it to be advanced from the start.
<MrEvergreen> I just wonder how stable it is.
<Unnr> its a nice middle ground if you want to get into a more cutting edge distribution, but don't want the headache of compiling everything
<Unnr> Its still a work in progress
<Barbetos> Half Life!
<Shizuka> 13i tried following a linux from scratch tutorial once... i gave up after gcc took two hours to compile in the vm >>
<MrEvergreen> o_o
<MrEvergreen> 2 hours???
<Unnr> Only 2 hours?
<Shizuka> 13^
<MrEvergreen> How much resources did you allocate for the vm?
<Shizuka> 13one of the cores and a gig of ram or so
<MrEvergreen> Hmm
<Shizuka> 13virtualbox was good about it but holy god it was slow
<Unnr> gcc tends to take a while, no matter what
<Barbetos> My last experience with VM involved installing it simply to play The Journyman Project again on windows 98.
<Shizuka> 13^
<tSparx> That's about the place I stopped, but I started back over, taking it slow, taking copious notes, reading every man page.
<Shizuka> 13i have an xp vm for journeyman project 3
<Barbetos> that is on the work pc too =P
<OtakuTom> wow...The Journeyman Project...thanks for hitting me with a nostalgia bomb :P
<Barbetos> Shizuka there is a 3rd one!? WUT!?
<Barbetos> I knew there where two...
<Shizuka> 13i used to have a 98 ISO from MSDN that i vm'd but i think i lost it in a format some years ago
<OtakuTom> I've only seen gameplay from 1 and 3...lol
<Barbetos> The only reason I played the first one is becuase of it being on the packard bell that my dad bought.
<Shizuka> 13third one is the only one i know cause there was a demo for it on riven cd 4
<OtakuTom> Yep, I remember the demo from Riven
<Barbetos> heh packard bell
<Shizuka> 13managed to track down a torrent earlier this year and ran it, great game
<Unnr> Good Old Games has both Journeyman Project 2 and 3 available
<Malk> I haz msn browser
<Barbetos> How did I miss that on gog
<Unnr> for sale, and gog release include pre-configured vm environments to make it easy
<tSparx> DAMNIT!
<Barbetos> Why is there a ghost in her room?
<Barbetos> There is a ghost in her class room
<Barbetos> wtf?
<tSparx> Each house has a ghost or two.
<Unnr> gog also has the longest journey <3
<tSparx> They're just part of the castle.
<OtakuTom> Yea, but TLJ still actually works on Win7 :P
<Phase4> 00,02i remember watching this on my 12th birthday
<Shizuka> 13the problem with them shortening the puzzle section of this movie is you miss the proof that snape is helping guard the stone with a potions puzzle
<Phase4> 00,02^
<OtakuTom> I completely forgot about the potions puzzle...I haven't read the book in a looooong time.
<Barbetos> Phase4 my older sister watched Titanic on her birthday. Ah memories.
<Unnr> No way, gog has phantasmagoria
<Unnr> *squeeeee*
<Phase4> 00,02Barbetos, odd film choice
<tSparx> Honestly, Joshihollywood (de Tumblr) said it best: these movies are highlight reels of the books.
<Barbetos> It came out around her birthday, and it had a convincing enough advertising campaing I guess
<Phase4> 00,02this movie alone is good imho
<Barbetos> and then Neville Longbottom was scared for life
<Phase4> 00,02it only breaks down when you bring continuity into it
<tSparx> Well, *yeah*, that's not a small deal, hahaha
<Phase4> 00,02thats what happens when you start making movies while the series is being written
<tSparx> Oh, well yeah, they don't do things quite right because they don't know what it links up to in the future
<Phase4> 00,02though tbh things did kinda just 'appear' in the last book
<Biglaw> run
<Biglaw> into the hole
<Biglaw> naw
<Unnr> Phase4: you mean Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machinas?
<Biglaw> nao
<Phase4> 00,02Unnr, eyup
<tSparx> lol
<Phase4> 00,02doesnt ruin it, still a good series
<Phase4> 00,02just a bit sudden
<Unnr> ^
<OtakuTom> I still need to read book 7...
<Biglaw> ALL the fishing bait!
<tSparx> ^^das Ding^^
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, do read it
<Phase4> 00,02worth it
<Barbetos> Phase4 just the idea of Rowling dancing to "I'm in the money" mean anything to you? XD
<Barbetos> If so take this pamplet.
<Phase4> 00,02how much did rowling make?
<Phase4> 00,02i imagine it was a big number
<Barbetos> Enough to not have to continue after book 7
<Barbetos> Which will come when she needs more
<Unnr> So wait, its like the last choice of Mass Effect 3, suddenly appears, is a bit silly in context, but still doesn't manage to kill the series as pretty awesome?
<tSparx> Though isn't she planning on doing some? Just more slowly, low-scale
<tSparx> Unnr: Ecactly
<Phase4> 00,02Unnr, i've not played that game but its different afaik
<tSparx> Exactly*
<Unnr> Phase4: as of 3/11 JKR is worth roughly 1 billion USD
<Phase4> 00,02woah
<Phase4> 00,02dats a bit of money
<tSparx> lawl
<princess> ima go bai!
<Ponies47> brb

<NocturnalBlade> bye princess
<OtakuTom> I thought Ron was the oldest bedwetter...lol

<Barbetos> Aw

<Barbetos> oh I am just kidding btw =P
*tSparx drapes a friendly arm over Barbetos' shoulder.
<Malk> I dont Barbetos I lov... I mean like you BROHOOF
<Barbetos> Stupid reference that I only understand, sorry in advance =P
<tSparx> Man, Malk, part of being a brony is sayin, "Forget it, I'll cry when I want. I'll squee when I want. If we fight, well, I might not when, but I'm having fun."
<tSparx> win*
<Barbetos> Malk /) :3
<tSparx> *house!*
<Barbetos> things!
<Malk> Barbetos /) buddy
<tSparx> Alle Dinge
<Malk> BROHOOF to all my brony brothers and sisters /)
<tSparx> BROHOOF!
<Phase4> 00,02Malk, (\
<AdamTheDuck> Malk: (\
<Barbetos> Ron should of done everyone a favor and sacrificed himself at that part.
<tSparx> Malk (\
<Shizuka> 13i'm still convinced
<Shizuka> 13there's way more than enough room for them to just go around the board
<Phase4> 00,02^
<AdamTheDuck> lol ^
<OtakuTom> agreed, shizu
<Barbetos> but MAAGGGIIICCC
<Phase4> 00,02i did always wonder that
<tSparx> Lol, I think in the book they make it clear that the chamber is small, and there are grates and stuff.
<Barbetos> ANd the PLOT demands it!
<Unnr> Or you know, go back a room, steal the brooms and fly over
<Malk> But its fun to play giant magic chess Shizuka
<Phase4> 00,02just have them jump off the board or put a fire pit there
<Phase4> 00,02the pieces that is
<tSparx> What, no Iron Maiden?
<Malk> Why is ron good at chess makes no sense
<Barbetos> And despite all those things their 11 year old minds decided to play the game. DOn't break the rules kids.
<tSparx> It was a fun game amongst his siblings.
<Shizuka> 13IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GAME
<Shizuka> 13AND HOW YOU PLAY IT
<Barbetos> Is it bad that all I can think when the queen approaches Ron on his Knight is "Hm. Yes. Quite."
<tSparx> Hermione didn't get too many chess games in her childhood, even in the United Kingdom. But Ron got whooped by Fred & George etc. a million times
<OtakuTom> I've always wanted to get 32 people together to play a full game of human chess...lol
<Malk> YOU BROKE THE RULES
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02and then rifftrax mentions the path
<Shizuka> 13why is he suddenly bloody
<MirrorImage> OtakuTom - BronyCon?
<Shizuka> 13he didn't get capped
<MirrorImage> Team Celestia/Luna vs Team Discord/Chrysalis?
<tSparx> It's the heat
<Phase4> 00,02if he wasnt then hermiony wouldnt need to stay back
<tSparx> Flamey and stuff
<tSparx> Awww
<Phase4> 00,02no, i dont know how to spell her name
<tSparx> Hermione
<MirrorImage> hermonie i believe
<OtakuTom> maybe at anime central...or if I end up going to Canterlot Gardens...
<Phase4> 00,02and now i know
<Shizuka> 13her mi o ne
<tSparx> HUHR-mee-oh-mee
<tSparx> HUHR-mee-oh-nee*
<Shizuka> 13ah i missed having the riffs here when we aired last week
<Unnr> hermyoninny
<Malk> MirroImage Team Armor Cadence
<Barbetos> Harmonie and Ron would of been hostages for Quirell.
<tSparx> Oh no, it's huhr-MEE-oh-nee*
<Barbetos> Convient plot devices are convient.
<MirrorImage> Malk - maybe as Knights...
<MirrorImage> but not as King/Queen
<Ponies47> Back
<tSparx> Oh snaps!
<Barbetos> Welcome back Ponies47
<Unnr> Just think of how doomed they would have been if it was Wizard's Go
<tSparx> The Old Dark Lord. Voldemort!
<Ponies47> Thanks Barbetos
<Malk> MirrorImage I think they will take out everyone else and become king and queen
<Shizuka> 13Unnr: egad
<MirrorImage> K-Celestia/Discord; Q-Luna/Chrysalis; Pawns - Royal Guards and Night Guards / Changelings
<Biglaw> Hur-Mi-ye-oh-nie
<MirrorImage> Rooks - Griffons and Manticores
<Barbetos> Yu-gi-oh!
<Barbetos> oh wait.
<Unnr> :D
<Shizuka> 13the tension and drama of a... bleh i forget the position where you just keep placing one piece to capture the other, back and forth forever
<Malk> K

<Phase4> 00,02could have used that on the chess level

<Barbetos> Jump in the fire. Book over.
<tSparx> Like that old CGI Canadian show, erm, ReBoot!
*Ponies47 Can't look at EQD becasue of the speed of his computer :/
<OtakuTom> While discord/chrysalis would be good king and queen...I also would like to see a set that uses Shining Armor and Cadence
<Shizuka> 13tSparx: yes that would be the idea :3
<Shizuka> 13you must not have been here for my streams of it
<Shizuka> 13firewall was a meme briefly
<Biglaw> Sumerpan >.>
<Phase4> 00,02i must have missed that episode
<MirrorImage> OtakuTom - only problem with that is there aren't enough "Cadence/Armor" supporting characters
<Phase4> 00,02Biglaw, the hero bronystate deserves
<tSparx> I'm a noob, remember? I just try and act all cool. I hadn't been on IRC for years before two days ago, haha
<MirrorImage> whereas if you go CeleLuna, you have the entire kingdom to work with
<Ponies47> Phase4: XD
<Biglaw> Phase4: What about Batpan?
<Ponies47> Biglaw: O.O
<Phase4> 00,02bust have missed that one
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<MirrorImage> Do you beLIEEEVE in Love?
<Malk> MirrorImage Armor is definatly knight
<Barbetos> Bronystate quiz: Who oringally did the typo of Sumerpan?
<Phase4> 00,02his hand causes the stone thing
<Phase4> 00,02but his throat doesnt?
<tSparx> This is like the ending of Who Framed Roger Rabbit
<Unnr> Mmm, reboot. *hugs their copy of the art of reboot*
<Ponies47> Barbetos: You :P
<Barbetos> Nah. I wish.
<Biglaw> Ash
<Phase4> 00,02Do ho ho
<Biglaw> :D
<Shizuka> 13there's the xmen riff i mentioned earlier
<Barbetos> I would love to be able to say I invented a meme, no matter how small
<MirrorImage> Malk - yeah, and either Cadence is a Knight as well, or she's the bishop on the same side as Armor
<MirrorImage> in which case, Twilight is the other bishop by default
<Barbetos> Like I said way earlier tonight, I am easy.
<Phase4> 00,02rifftrax doesnt work as well on good movies
<tSparx> I watched the whole series 'round this time last year, and then .hack//sign afterward
<MirrorImage> and spike as that Knight?
<AdamTheDuck> Wait I just realised... why does the bottom say "The Sorcerer's Stone"? Isn't it philiospher's stone?
<tSparx> MirrorImage: Word
<MirrorImage> which leaves the question of the Rooks... Dash and AJ?
<Phase4> 00,02AdamTheDuck, in america it was called the sorcerers stone
<Shizuka> 13AdamTheDuck: it was "sorceror's stone" in the US because alchemy wasn't really a thing over here
<Unnr> AJ
<tSparx> AdamTheDuck: In America, it was retitled The Sorceror's Stone
<Shizuka> 13so "philosopher" doesn't mean "alchemist"
<Malk> He touched me there officer Shizuka
<Phase4> 00,02see shizu's answer
<tSparx> Cause that's what most call it here
<AdamTheDuck> I see...
<tSparx> It does! In *Britain*. In America, it's philosophy professors, studying Plato etc.
<Ponies47> (Instert TF2 to meme Seeman here with him saying (SEE?!?!)) :p
<Chrysalis> Mornin' everyone

<Shizuka> 13SI
<Chrysalis> Barbetos i used to do that ALOT
<Chrysalis> but now i have to pack to move :(
<MirrorImage> it's the Discord/Chrysalis side that'd cause problems...
<Malk> itsonly 12 am here
<Phase4> 00,02the problem with 'every flavor beans' is that there are a lot of flavors, many of them very similar, most of them shit
<MirrorImage> I vote Manticores for the Rooks, but i'm a little stumped as to Knights and Bishops
<Ponies47> Me and my silliness :P
<tSparx> Nameless Pony #47
<tSparx> Salve
<Barbetos> Chrysalis A new place eh? Sounds liek fun. =D
<Chrysalis> Barbetos I'm moving to manchester
<Unnr> Mmm, vindaloo flavoured beans
<Chrysalis> so at least BUCK next year will be awesome
<Malk> Mirrorimage I think Buffalo should be rooks mabye
<Ponies47> tSparx: NOPE! This is the nickname I have sticked with since I first started coming here ^^
<MirrorImage> Malk - not for Discord/Changeling
<MirrorImage> not for "Evil"
<tSparx> I know, the default would be Pony47, yes?
<Malk> MirrorImage im talking good
<Chrysalis> love clap
<Chrysalis> sounds rude
<Shizuka> 13412 points now
<tSparx> slow clap!
<Barbetos> BUCK looks and sounds like it was so much fun. Not to mention getting to meet some other bronystaters. I wish I could of gone so much. =( But I do not make enough money to up and fly there. =\
<Shizuka> 13472
<Barbetos> Then 1 point.
<Phase4> 00,02472 points?
<Ponies47> tSparx: The default would be pony_4772 or somthing like that. Besides I like my nick name! It's shor and sweet to the point! ^^
<Barbetos> 10 points
<Barbetos> I mean
<Ponies47> *short
<tSparx> I wish I could fly out of MO, or drive across via ferry, to Britain. But I can't :/
<Shizuka> 13nah slytherin was 472
<tSparx> Ponies47: Yeah yeah, it really is you ;)
<Shizuka> 13so they tied and overtook
<Unnr> re-killing voldemort, 60 points, catching the snitch, 150 points, so broken
<Malk> MirrorImage zecora should be bishop
<Phase4> 00,02dem faces
<Ponies47> tSparx: ;)
<MirrorImage> Malk - if we assume a third team, sure
<Phase4> 00,02they need to put the sorting hat in tf2
<Chrysalis> 3 houses celebrate when one wins
<Phase4> 00,02and it should speak
<Chrysalis> Phase4 YES!
<MirrorImage> but Celestia/Luna really should encompass Mane cast, with the exception of the pawns
<Barbetos> what was hagrid in? Griffondor? Was it ever said ?
<tSparx> I've always thought I'd love to sit in a room talking quietly with the Sorting Hat
<Chrysalis> ALL of my yes
<Dismo> Phase4|2: OMGYES
<Shizuka> 13Chrysalis: especially because hufflepuff was now last place
<Malk> Im going to put some jack daniels in that cup and drink it
<Phase4> 00,02Dismo, why you ping Phase4|2 ?
<Shizuka> 13[02:11] [+Phase4] they need to put the sorting hat in tf2
<Shizuka> 13hmm difficult
<Shizuka> 13very difficult
<tSparx> MirrorImage: Yeah, we need multiple sets.
<Phase4> 00,02Dismo, might want to refresh your client
<Shizuka> 13you have energy yes
<Ponies47> Speaking of TF2. I found some really awesome Gmod videos that I ahve never seen streamed here before. IThey are funny :P
<Shizuka> 13but you like attacking
<Shizuka> 13i know where i'll put you...
<Ponies47> *have
<Shizuka> 13BLU TEAM
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, XD
<Chrysalis> RED TEAM
<Chrysalis> damnit shizuy
<Malk> MirrorImage I Think it would be nice if Zecora was there as bishop though
<Shizuka> 13actually
<Dismo> Phase4: There, all better.
<Shizuka> 13they have a sorting hat
<Barbetos> lol Wouldn't it pick a class instead?
<Shizuka> 13and it's just as unfair and biased
<Phase4> 00,02they do?
<Shizuka> 13it's called autobalance
<tSparx> Zecora is a queen, really
<Ponies47> Shizuka: Oh you! XD
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Barbetos> brand new F2P person? SNIPER!!
<Chrysalis> Shizuka they need to nerf the autobalance
<tSparx> Queen of the Evergreen
<NocturnalBlade> Shizuka: zing
<Malk> whos queen tsparx
<Chrysalis> so you dont get moved as a team is about to lose
<Phase4> 00,02in theory i like servers with class limits
<tSparx> Zacora, the Zebra!
<Phase4> 00,02only one spy and sniper
*Ponies47 Is meh at sniper but can still get them
<Phase4> 00,02in practice, the crap players steal the spots
<Chrysalis> i really wish more servers ran without random crits
<tSparx> She's the only consistently good thing to live out in the Everfree Forest
<Phase4> 00,02and you end up with two tumors on your team
<Barbetos> I wish TF2 would introduce modes for teams GRN and YLO. TFC had an AWESOME flag hold map with all four teams
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, i dont, random crits throw a bit of chance into the game
<Ponies47> Dat Hogwarts Express :P
<Phase4> 00,02to each their own i supose
<Chrysalis> yeah, but never on my side
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Chrysalis> its everyone else that gets them
<Malk> Phase4 I wish they had team FFAs in TF2
<MirrorImage> Chrysalis - attack more
<MirrorImage> get more crits
<Barbetos> I would play GRN pyro all the time.
<tSparx> Alright, stepping away to grab food or whatever, prolly be back later.
<Phase4> 00,02BUILDING A SENTRY
<Barbetos> Just saying.
<Dismo> Shizuka: Were you autherized to use it? >:C
<MirrorImage> WHAT IS LOVE?!
<Shizuka> 13>>
<Shizuka> 13<<
<Shizuka> 13yes
<Chrysalis> MirrorImage sentries doont get random crits
<Shizuka> 13maybe
<Unnr> Okies everyone
<Ponies47> Engineer!
<Chrysalis> medics dont get crit heals
<Shizuka> 13WHAT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER ><
<Unnr> time to pretend to get a few hours of sleep
<Unnr> Shizuka: Mu.
<Barbetos> Keep saying answers and you will be right eventually.
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, if you remove random crits then those weapons with no random crits as a drawback become op
<Phase4> 00,02not by much but they do
<Malk> I LIVE IN TEXAS AND AM A ENGINEER DOES THAT MAKE ME ENGIE?
<Unnr> Seriously, when in doubt Mu/Wu, best answer ever
<Ponies47> My arrrrrrrm!
<Barbetos> This video came out befoer the game release IIRC which is why you never hear the "MY ARRRMMM!!" death sound in game.
<Dismo> THE WOMAN! SHE'S BROKEN THE LAW!
<Phase4> 00,02Major, POOTIS SPENCER HERE
<Ponies47> POOTIS POOTIS POOTIS!

<Unnr> Oooh, that trackmania forever screen

<Barbetos> Now. The real question is, who was recorded saying that?
<Barbetos> Nailgun was a quake thing though.
<Ponies47> Shizuka: Nail gun? O.O
<Phase4> 00,02Building a nailgun
<Barbetos> Or.. Gldsrc if you want to get technical
<Shizuka> 13nerf it or give it to sniper as an SMG replacement
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka, from tf clasic right?
<Barbetos> or.. even IDtech2
<Shizuka> 13but they just have to bring it back
<Barbetos> or wahtever
<Shizuka> 13it was there in tf2 beta also
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Shizuka> 13you can see it in the original trailer and at the end of meet the heavy's lineup
<Phase4> 00,02as a weapon or sentry?
<Shizuka> 13scoot weapon
<Shizuka> 13not sure if the scattergun or pistol replaced it
<Barbetos> OH yeah I remember
<Phase4> 00,02i'm guessing the pistol
<Unnr> o/ bai all
<Phase4> 00,02later Unnr

<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Story Updates August 22nd (Morning)

<Malk> ?
<OtakuTom> Of course, now I'm at the point where I have to wait for the bank to respond, since it's a short sale x_x
<AdamTheDuck> Derpy123: Twilight is not amused :P
<Derpy123> What? What's wrong?
<Derpy123> AdamTheDuck STFU Hey that rhymed
<Malk> Me giving candy to kids to see peoples reactions
<AdamTheDuck> Derpy123: You're a poet and you don't even know it?
<Derpy123> Uh find it weird but generous, why?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Fuuuu...forgot I was in Creative Mode >>
<Dismo> SuperBrony64: YOU SILLY

<AdamTheDuck> Yay I'm a pato now
<Derpy123> LMAO> Yes you are. :)
<Malk> Derpy123 one woman threaten to call the police and I said what are you going to say I offered your child candy?
<Derpy123> Well kidnappers usually dress up in a disguise to lure kids in to their homes and offer them candy, so no I don't know why they would think of calling the cops, Malk. :/
<Malk> I dont really do that anymore thought because now it is pretty bad for me to do it
<Malk> Bear costume is my thing now
<AdamTheDuck> lolwut :D ^
<Derpy123> Well it is a nice jester true, but out of the ordinary which may make people be suspicous.
<Malk> I wear a bear costume and scare adults
<Derpy123> AdamTheDuck, and he gives little kids candy while doing so.
<Malk> Derpy123 no not at the same time
<Derpy123> ...ok
<AdamTheDuck> Aww, that would be funny...
<Malk> I would just be at the park normal and offer kids candy
<Derpy123> Ever get chased by the popo?
<Malk> and I seperatly wear costume and scare people in park
<Malk> Derpy123 nope they dont really care
<AdamTheDuck> Lol still not as bad as my friend who put "Able to give out candy to people" on his resume
<Derpy123> Wuut. Lol.
<AdamTheDuck> He works at Kmart and because there's a jar of lollies
<Malk> Everyone in the area pretty much knows its me when I do it so they dont mind
<AdamTheDuck> he makes sure everyone who passes by take at least one
<Malk> Its kind of like at a point where no one cares eccept people not from around my area
<AdamTheDuck> Dem minecarts
<Malk> usually I scare other people I know
<SuperBrony64> 11,02So yeah...not going to do this trial >>

<tSparx> Ha!
<Sumica> 00,10pay no mind to the empty folder icon
<MASF123> Yup
<tSparx> It'd be funny if you could "hide" folders by putting them behind curtains hahaha
<MASF123> He should label, it SuperBrony64's gay porn stash that way I won't want to look in it.
<MASF123> Now THAT is thinkin' smart.

<Dismo> WOAH
<tSparx> Sumica: Oh Alabama jokes
<Dismo> WOAHWOAHWOAH
<MASF123> Sumica, I read that when Veggie posted it. I LOL'd hard.
<Dismo> "Dash X Pink..."
<tSparx> OH GOD IT'S NOT... that one... IS IT!?
<tSparx> The Fic Which Must Not Be Named?
<Barbetos> What?
<Malk> is steam down?
<tSparx> (.........that's not cupcakes in that folder, is it? blurgh.......)
<Malk> ??
<Barbetos> Where did you find that particular peice of interesting literature Sumica?
<Sumica> 00,10the intertubes
<Sumica> 00,10it was linked to me
<MadSurge> tSparx: more likely shipping pics :D
<tSparx> It's a fanfiction about cannabalism. It was honestly one of the first things I heard about the Brony movement. Disturbing :/
<MASF123> Can I request a vid?
<Malk> Barbetos stream down?
<Barbetos> Yeah
<tSparx> MadSurge: God I hope so heh heh
<Dark_Horst> tSparx: you're talking cupcakes and no, it's not a forbidden word
<Malk> you think I should post the project Barbetos?
<Barbetos> Sure why not?
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64 isn't a Cupcakes guy :D
<tSparx> No, it makes me hiss just to see the word! Nah, but seriously, gives me the heeby-jeebies
<Malk> or do you think they can wait for the fun?
<Dark_Horst> also, everybody knows it. hell, there was a time when reading it was almost viewed as a rite of passage into the herd
<Barbetos> Malk in between streams is the best time to put it up honestly
<MASF123> What are you talking about? SuperBrony64 LOVES Cupcakes!
<MadSurge> Dark_Horst: well I never did, am I not a brony then? :D
<tSparx> That would've been... I would've looked straight past Pinkie and Rarity and co., and said, "Nope, not doing this. Nope!"
<AdamTheDuck> Cupcakes... so sweet and tastey...
<Dark_Horst> MadSurge: HEATHEN! IMPOSTOR!
<Barbetos> < never read cupcakes
<seatsea> How long has the stream been off?
<Barbetos> I might have to fix that though
<tSparx> < Will never read cupcakes
<MASF123> don't read it
<Dark_Horst> DO IT
<AdamTheDuck> READ IT
<Dark_Horst> DO IT, YOU WIMP!
<AdamTheDuck> NAO
<Malk> Special If you dont like spoilers to a new parody im doing dont click if you want to see first draft and comment feel free
<tSparx> It's the same thing, sorta, as that horrid 2girls1cup thing a few years ago.
<tSparx> I don't succumb that easy to peer pressure guys.
<Malk> http://meetingwords.com/49Vfxuyaqo
<MadSurge> Real life cupcakes :Q
<Barbetos> I've already unwittingly read some clop fics. I started them and could not stop. Morbid curiousity I suppose
<Dark_Horst> tSparx: actually that'S bullshit
<Barbetos> I am already scared enough. Cupcakes can be that much worse
<MASF123> I give Cupcakes a 1.1/10 rating on fimfiction.net
<tSparx> Dark_Horst: I'm not looking down on anybody who enjoys it. That's their thing, though; it gives me the creeps.
<Dark_Horst> comparing it to 2girls1cup is still bullshot
<tSparx> I lump it all together in the "Things I don't want to see ever" folder of my brain
<tSparx> That's how they're similar, that's all I meant :.
<tSparx> :/*
<Barbetos> tSparx I have a milk crate for that.
<Dark_Horst> Barbetos: you must've read the wrong ones
<thegt90> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4RyXvd0kjE&feature=g-vrec i like this this is nice
<Dark_Horst> tSparx: they're not similar
<Dark_Horst> not even remotely
<tSparx> Oh thanks Barbetos :) I needed a joke, that was getting dark.
<MASF123> Barbetos slim, from Futurama
<tSparx> I'M NOT SAYING THEY ARE
<tSparx> I'm saying I don't wanna see either.
<Dark_Horst> you just did
<tSparx> That's how they're similar from my point of view.
<Barbetos> MASF123 I actually did not get this user name from that.
<MASF123> Was from the PoTC stream?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sorry about that, computer got blue screened :<
<Barbetos> nah that neither. I got it as a suggestion when I was trying to name my Night Elf Rogue, it just stuck after that.
<MASF123> awww...
<DashWithRainbows> damn it SuperBrony64, you had one job!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:<
<DashWithRainbows> But at least it's gone, that's all that matters.
<MASF123> Yeah...true.
<Barbetos> SB64 thats not a normal thing is it?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02No >>
<MASF123> I get blue screen commonly, it is because of lack of memory.
<MASF123> for me I mean.
<Barbetos> Depends on what the error is MASF123
<Barbetos> Probably not though
<Barbetos> If it where a memory issue your computer probably would not boot at all
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I have 8 GB of Memory
<MASF123> Hmm...he's setting stuff up I see
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Sorry, I mean I have 1 TB of Memory
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:>
<Dark_Horst> i must be the last guy on the planet who still has only 4GB
<MASF123> Is there a schedule of which mod streams at what time?
<OtakuTom> 8gb on laptop, 12 on desktop
<Barbetos> SB64 I want yur ram and mobo
<Malk> I have 6GB on my labtop
<Barbetos> 12 is a strange number.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02My CPU is a Lenovo and it runs at 8 Ghz.
<MASF123> 1 Terrabyte? Lucky fuck
<Malk> upgrading to 8
<Barbetos> Actually I have 14, so I can't be one to speak
<SuperBrony64> 11,02...My troll failed >>
<Jmo> You think >.>
<Barbetos> Oh. Don't sell yourself short.
<Barbetos> I was almost this close to looking up if a proc could do that on a laptop, untill you said something
<Barbetos> and by this close imagine a small space between my thumb and finger.
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 maybe you should of been less obvious
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Maybe you should give me a hug :I

<MASF123> Malk yes, burn that idea with fire
<MASF123> I want to punch someone!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Is making a fanfiction crossing between MLP and Thomas the Tank Engine bad?
<DashWithRainbows> No.
<MASF123> No

<DashWithRainbows> No it is not.
<Barbetos> Did you read what he posted though MASF123?
<Jmo> Dem responses.
<DashWithRainbows> Because Tom is best boulder train
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What if it was a clopfiction?
<Malk> Im working on it right now so MASF123 I cant burn it its in my labtop
<Dark_Horst> SuperBrony64: fire up the notpad
<Jmo> What is going around your mind SuperBrony64 x_x
<AdamTheDuck> SuperBrony64: Whaaaa....?

<MASF123> Oh no
<Dark_Horst> well, it could be grimdark
<MASF123> MLP should cross with Slenderman
<Barbetos> And make it a drama

<Chrysalis> Its actually a pretty good game
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 i got it about the same price
<Chrysalis> Wii / XBOX?
<OtakuTom> DJ Hero was a good idea and overall a good game, but I still think some of the execution was a little off, and kinda did in the whole "Hero" series.
<MASF123> SuperBrony64, Play Pajanoo with Shout! Plz.
<Barbetos> It did so bad
<MASF123> Yeah it did
<Chrysalis> oh wii
<Chrysalis> lame
<Chrysalis> could of joined if it was the xbox version

<Malk> Im going tot go ahead and say good night in advance because I think ill go to sleep soon so good night everypony

<Barbetos> Yeah. WERD!
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 its not that hard, but the tutorial is really badly organised
<Chrysalis> it goes through features that dont appear until hard/expert
<Chrysalis> before finishing all the normal ones
<Barbetos> So now you have a curvy road
<Barbetos> It almost sounds like the tutorial guy does not know what he is talking about
<Barbetos> "If I keep saying it is simple it will wall work out"
<AdamTheDuck> 'nother one down
<Barbetos> lazers
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This game is easy :D
<slinky> this is just the beginning
<Barbetos> So when does the game simulate the neighbors coming over and telling yoy to turn it down
<Jmo> Playing at that type of speed is murder.
<Jmo> TOO SLOW.
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 wait till you play a couple of song
<MASF123> SuperBrony64, you should play a song from the scratch perverts
<Chrysalis> or daft punk
<Jmo> Daft Punk <3
<Chrysalis> jmo IKR
<Jmo> I'd take them over todays generation anyday.
<MASF123> One More Time
<Jmo> Technologic
<Jmo> Around The World
<Chrysalis> also the scratch perverts are easy technically
<Jmo> Da Funk
<Chrysalis> and are much more of an endurance song
<Jmo> Wish I could of gone to Alive 2007 ;~;
<MASF123> Stop! Shout!
<MASF123> Let it all out Let it all out Let it all out.....
<MASF123> Arount the World we gooo...Around the World we gooo...
<MASF123> ded
<MASF123> Like my life purpose
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Now I know how it feels to be Vinyl Scratch :D
<MASF123> She uses magic
<slinky> :D
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 just wait
<MadSurge> :D
<Chrysalis> youll feel BADASS by the end of the tutorial
<OtakuTom> SuperBrony64: If you have a PS2, try to find Beatmania.
<Chrysalis> then get knocked back when you try a song
<MASF123> Another one bites the dust
<MASF123> Dust Dust Dust
<Buytoast> what is this dj hero?
<MASF123> Yeah
<SuperBrony64> 11,02OtakuTom: Okie :3
<MASF123> Left, Up, Down, Right
<Chrysalis> these dont appear on anything below hard
<MASF123> Ooooh don't lose it SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I feel like putting the middle of my fingers on the button instead of the tips is easier >>
<MASF123> Your the DJ
<Chrysalis> and these also dont appear on anything below hard
<MASF123> Only nubs play under hard of course
<Chrysalis> MASF123 yeah
<Chrysalis> this games a BITCH on hard
<Chrysalis> theres a massive jump
<OtakuTom> Yea, the ramp up in difficulty is crazy.
<MASF123> main problem of DJ Hero is that Easy, Normal is easy, but hard is normal and Expert is hard modes.
<Chrysalis> thats one way of putting it
<Chrysalis> they needed to make normal harder
<MadSurge> EXCELLENT
<MASF123> It's like the American version of Devil May Cry with it's fake difficulty system
<Chrysalis> these are a nightmare
<Chrysalis> and only appear on expert
<MASF123> Slide left right
<MASF123> SuperBrony64
<XAX> dis song
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Huh MASF123?
<XAX> PRE'E SLICK MANG
<MASF123> Oh hell no
<slinky> here we go
<XAX> that demo in the background
<XAX> looks
<XAX> hard
<MASF123> Rewind
<Chrysalis> oh look
<Chrysalis> and back to easy/normal features
<Chrysalis> also, because you cant see it
<XAX> aaaaand im off the pc.
<Chrysalis> the button actually glows on the controller
<Chrysalis> when euphoria is ready
<MASF123> Ye-aah Y- ahhhhh
<Chrysalis> unlike guitar hero, euphoria can be used after one sequence and you can hold up to 3
<Chrysalis> unlike guitar hero which activates after 2 and holds 4
<MASF123> Lol. You can't fail at DJ Hero too.
<MASF123> Song goes on even if you mess up.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Too bad this controller can't double as a record player...
<Chrysalis> MASF123 yeah that REALLY bugs me about this game
<Chrysalis> you cannot fail
<MASF123> The audience likes whatever you dish out even if it's crap.
<slinky> indeed
<Chrysalis> must be how biber gets so popular
<MASF123> yuuuup
<Chrysalis> everyone is actually a dj hero player
<MASF123> pretty much
<Chrysalis> heh, SuperBrony64 just did what always gets me, leaving the slider
<MASF123> oooh
<MASF123> :/
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Leaving the slider? o.o
<MASF123> haha
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 yeah you left the crossfader in the wrong position
<Bunny_Striker> my cousins had this game
<Chrysalis> always gets me after a rewind
<MASF123> wammy
<Chrysalis> oh man these wammys get you SO MANY points
<Chrysalis> doubles your score, and adds to it for as long as your still rotating the effects knob
<MASF123> SuperBrony64, just pretend your giving a nipple twister
<Chrysalis> MASF123 thats a wierd ass nipple twister
<MASF123> Your not helping
<MASF123> Dat spam
<MASF123> YEEAAAH BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIii
<Bunny_Striker> MASF123: or turning a combination lock
<Chrysalis> Bunny_Striker thats a good example
<MASF123> Live on Freddy Mercury
<Bunny_Striker> 4:43 already?? time goes fast when you`re not paying attention
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Activision games always have the best online on the Wii >>
<Bunny_Striker> ...
<MASF123> Wi-Fi fails again
<MASF123> BAM
<SuperBrony64> 11,02WiFi is working now, just no-one online...
<MASF123> Sure >_>
<MASF123> I thinkit's the servers
<SuperBrony64> 11,02No...no-one plays this game online anymore...especially on the Wii >>
<MASF123> If you had it on Xbox I'm sure you'd find one person
<MASF123> And another one's one
<MASF123> gone
<MASF123> Was this cheaper for Wii?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Like I said, it was $15 :)
*Jmo glomps SuperBrony64

<Buytoast> i don;t blame you
<Derpy123> Yeah most DJ most DJs suck...only some are good.
<CrimsonPhoenix> I want to hear aftPunk/Queen
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Original songs are cool, but live scratching and doing effects like that to music...I just don't like it <<
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, even AlexS? :(
<Derpy123> AlexS is great
<SuperBrony64> 11,02AlexS is OK.

<Derpy123> DJ Alex S
<CrimsonPhoenix> doesn't make him more a DJ
<Derpy123> Well he kind of mixes songs so I would say he is in some way.
<Derpy123> But true, he probably neer used a turn table.

<Dark_Horst> DaringDerpy: according to the toaster in big mountain, a heating element is nothing else than a death ray with a smaller power supply. just grab one and connect it to the reactor
<DaringDerpy> I like this way of thinking! :)
<Phase4> 00,02i've broken everything
<Kammerjunk> I come in and is greeted by death rays.
<Kammerjunk> am*
<tSparx> Gratz Phase4 . What an experience.
<DaringDerpy> good afternoon Kammerjunk :)
<Kammerjunk> Afternoon´.
<tSparx> Whoa-oh, I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien I'm an Englishman in New York
<DaringDerpy> two of three kerbals should try yoga
<Dark_Horst> oh, Dregs!
<Phase4> 00,02they lived
<tSparx> ka!?
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: at which version is KSP now?
<seatsea> 16
<Phase4> 00,020.13
<Phase4> 00,02wait
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,020.16
<Phase4> 00,02i'm using the demo
<Phase4> 00,02for the lulz
<Dark_Horst> that'S a lot of rocket
<tSparx> Alright, it's seriously bedtime. I have to be up in 5-ish hours.
<DaringDerpy> sleep well
<seatsea> i dont have to go to bed for an other 10h (i live in france)
<seatsea> and i am on holiday
<Dark_Horst> ...this will break
<seatsea> no it will explode
<Dark_Horst> it will break and then the paets will explode
<seatsea> under a fracrtion of a second
<Dark_Horst> see? called it
<Dark_Horst> oh lord
<Dark_Horst> the rocket is dancing
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: what are we listening to? i think i heard it before
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN3ETtGRiQI&feature=autoplay&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&playnext=3
<Dark_Horst> ah, so THAT was it
<seatsea> if anypony is wondering i am caled seatsea because if you say it it'd my initals
<seatsea> ti's not ti'd
<seatsea> ok i tryto corect my self but failed
<Phase4> 00,02hmmmm
<Phase4> 00,02also trying to do without struts
<Phase4> 00,02this is proving dificult
<Flyboy> i'm back guys. who's streaming now?
<Flyboy> phase?
<Phase4> 00,02eyup
<Flyboy> kewl
<Dark_Horst> what just happened?
<Flyboy> i think something exploded
<Flyboy> oh my...
<DaringDerpy> success!
<Flyboy> trololol?
<DaringDerpy> there might be a heat problem
<Phase4> 00,02i give up on the no struts
<Phase4> 00,02just a smidge too hard with that
<Flyboy> bum bum bum bum buuuum buuuum bum bum bum buuuuum buuuum bum bum bum buuuuuuuuum buum bum bum bum buuuum
<Phase4> 00,02by which i meen i'm adding that one righ of struts
<Phase4> 00,02and thats it
<DaringDerpy> lol
<Dark_Horst> thsi one is called dae lunae, if anyone's wondering
<Flyboy> oh my...
<DaringDerpy> for the new lunar republic
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i need sleepies soon /).(\
<Dark_Horst> naw, that's another one
<Dark_Horst> makkon made a version of it too, though
<DaringDerpy> it's a remix
*SuperBrony64 hugs Phase4
<DaringDerpy> the basic structure is the same
*Phase4 00,02hugs SuperBrony64 back
<Dark_Horst> DaringDerpy: no it'S not. it'S a remake of luna deos
<Phase4> 00,02sleep
<Phase4> 00,02you need it
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Phase4 is mah friend :3c
*Flyboy hugs myself
<Phase4> 00,02:3
*SuperBrony64 hugs Flyboy
*Flyboy hugs SuperBrony64
<Dark_Horst> DaringDerpy: i dare you to go to his account right now and compare. lunar republic is a whole other instance
<DaringDerpy> yes. I mixed it up
*Flyboy hugs the dead bodies of the kerbals
<Phase4> 00,02silly game and its near imposibility without struts
<Flyboy> just like in real life!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02i liek silly :3/
<Phase4> 00,02those bits are ment to explode
<Phase4> 00,02its ok
<Flyboy> someone must get that... anyone? GOD DAMN IT!
<DaringDerpy> what about the heat buildup? something exploded
<SuperBrony64> 11,02wut game u playin? o.o
<Phase4> 00,02kerbal space program
<Phase4> 00,02the demo version
<DaringDerpy> no, Flyboy
<DaringDerpy> sry
<Flyboy> :,(
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What's a kerbal? >>
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: The best rocket exploding simulator :D
<Phase4> 00,02SuperBrony64, a little green astronaught
<Flyboy> our plaything
<Dark_Horst> oh this one goes well with rockets
<DaringDerpy> a miserable pile of yay
<Flyboy> 's*
<Phase4> 00,02rocket fodder
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Rockets exploding are cool :D
<Phase4> 00,02dis rocket is going too slow
<Phase4> 00,02i must remember to add more thrust
<Flyboy> Phase4: where you get that playlist from?
<Phase4> 00,02youtube
<Dark_Horst> when in doubt, MOAR ROCKART!
<Randomnerd> What game is ths?
<Chrysalis> Rocket not working as expected?
<Chrysalis> add more rockets
<Dark_Horst> kerbal space program
<Zawan> i return to glorious rockets:)
<Flyboy> Phase4: whats the name of the playlist, or who is it by
<MadSurge> SuperBrony64: you can go TO THE MOOOON or a tinier moon with your makeshift rockets
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PLs7QuwzRc&feature=autoplay&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&playnext=5
<Flyboy> thank you
<Randomnerd> MadSurge: The moooooooooonah?! :O
<MadSurge> Randomnerd: Kerbals like mmmmmmmmmmbananas.
<Phase4> 00,02you know your doing it right when you have to fix your rocket mid flight
<Phase4> 00,02wow, did not take long to empty those tanks
<Phase4> 00,02now
<Phase4> 00,02need to transfer
<Phase4> 00,02then land
<MadSurge> Why back to the demo version Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02because i'm too good in 0.16
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai everyone :)
<AdamTheDuck> Yay Kerbals
<AdamTheDuck> with fitting music
<AdamTheDuck> ded chat :/
<Phase4> 00,02i knew i forgot something
<MadSurge> AdamTheDuck: kinda
<Phase4> 00,02cant land on the mun without phasepony
<Dark_Horst> hm... i dont know this part. still makkon?
<Phase4> 00,02still makkon
<MadSurge> Phase4: that's better :D
<Phase4> 00,02spinning this rocket takes a while
<Phase4> 00,02also this is the first launch that didnt explode
<Phase4> 00,02will totaly make the mun
<Phase4> 00,02night SuperBrony64|Zzz
<SuperBrony64|Zzz> 11,02Night all, have fun Phase4 :3
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight SuperBrony64|Zzz
<Chrysalis> G'Night SuperBrony64|Zzz sleep well
<Phase4> 00,02i will ^_^
<MadSurge> Night SuperBrony64|Zzz :)
<Serenity> Hey ponies, I'm back
<Serenity> yet I must make TOAST
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back Serenity
<Phase4> 00,02now
<Phase4> 00,02this version doesnt show transfer thingys
<Phase4> 00,02the orange thing when you enter another bodys gravity
<Phase4> 00,02so this will be pure luck
<Chrysalis> good luck Phase4
<AdamTheDuck> Yay pure luck is best gamble
<AdamTheDuck> screw educated guesses
<Phase4> 00,02THAT
<Phase4> 00,02now that was awesome
<AdamTheDuck> Strangly the music fits very well o.o
<Chrysalis> god damn Phase4
<Chrysalis> did you hit orbit of the moon from that
<Phase4> 00,02^_^
<MadSurge> Dat Pinkie :D
<Serenity> Looks like it
<Phase4> 00,02i'm in orbit
<Phase4> 00,02about ready to land
*Chrysalis applauds
<Phase4> 00,02but first
<Phase4> 00,02have to wee
<seatsea> music fit very well
<Serenity> Of course you do.
<MadSurge> But first! BUUUUUT FIIIIIIIIRRRRRRSSSSSTTTTTT... I gotta take a wheeze!
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02gona wait for a luna day
<seatsea> well i am going to be awayfor a few hours. bye
<Phase4> 00,02imagine beeing these guys
<Phase4> 00,02'sorry, you'll need to wait a month or so'
<Phase4> 00,02'cant see where to land otherwise'
<XAX> dat feel
<MadSurge> Phase4: they'd probably go all Party of One :D
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<AdamTheDuck> Fitting music is once again fitting :3
<Phase4> 00,02remember
<Phase4> 00,02i have no landing gear
<AdamTheDuck> Pfft, who needs landing gear when you can crash
<AdamTheDuck> Sudden music change is also very fitting o.o
<Phase4> 00,02i've hacked together some wings
<Phase4> 00,02tested them on kerbin
<Phase4> 00,02can land on them
<Dark_Horst> silly phase, kerbals dont land, they explode controlled
<Phase4> 00,02also i have no idea if the ground is at the same level
<Phase4> 00,02quiet in here
<Dark_Horst> anticipating
<killerpony7733> Yup
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02cant slow that fast
<Phase4> 00,02powerfull rocket
<Phase4> 00,02heavy lander
<Phase4> 00,02if this doesnt explode i'ma be amazed
<Serenity> Mah fookin' interent connecshun dedded :/
<Phase4> 00,02dat feel
*AdamTheDuck wonders who Serenity is writing that comment with no internet connection :P
<AdamTheDuck> how*
<AdamTheDuck> *yay*
<Serenity> AdamTheDuck: IM
<Phase4> 00,02where is the ground
<Serenity> Below yoyu
<Phase4> 00,02:<
<Dark_Horst> down there
<MadSurge> Dat Avast Octavia's Ass
<Phase4> 00,02usint a lot more fuel than i want to
<AdamTheDuck> But you're usin' fuel for science, so it's alright :P
<Serenity> Love how badly textured the mun is
<Phase4> 00,02starting to see ground texture
<Phase4> 00,02its close
<Nyst> Lucky. I've never even managed to reach Mun yet.
<Phase4> 00,02i've done it many times :P
<killerpony7733> Phase4: What is the song i'm hearing? sounds a bit familiar
<Serenity> I've only managed it once
<Serenity> I was about to land
<Phase4> 00,02http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xcKACtKLnA&feature=autoplay&list=UUmMWwYyeQlZzbeynRJwCSGg&playnext=14
<Serenity> Then my fucking parachute fails and I die
<Phase4> 00,02landings are the hard bit
<Phase4> 00,02you cant parachute on the mun :P
<Phase4> 00,02no air
<Serenity> Ahh, so that's why it failed
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Phase4> 00,02have to do controled descents like this one
<Dark_Horst> from descrption
<Dark_Horst> Also, it appears that this song has a similar chord progression to Rainbow Factory, which is awesome. Though it's important to point out that my audio sketch was released long before Wooden Toaster submitted his song, so there's no connection as far as I can tell. Rock on, though WoodenToaster! Your work is top notch!
<Dark_Horst> thats why it sounds familiar
<Nyst> I've managed to rocket landings on Kerbal so I think I could land on Mun. But it's getting there. I tend to over or undershoot it every time.
<AdamTheDuck> Dark_Horst: Yeah had a strange feeling it was like Rainbow Factory
<Phase4> 00,02i'm happy i spent the weight and got the sas
<Golakka> Horyshreet! KSP!
<Phase4> 00,02this would be near imposible without
<Golakka> Also hi :D
<Wrek> 05oh Iran banned Battle.net IPs todayu
<Serenity> Phase4: It was worth the weight - GabeN
<Wrek> 05bring out the proxies!
<Serenity> Olol
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, odd, why?
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, XD
<Dark_Horst> Wrek: iran?
<Golakka> Canards? For landing on the moon Phase4 ?
<Chrysalis> Wrek that seems odd, any idea why
<Phase4> 00,02Chrysalis, yeah
<Phase4> 00,02derp
<Phase4> 00,02Golakka, yeah
<Nyst> Funny that parachutes don't work, but winglets do.
<Golakka> Do they actually work on the moon?
<Phase4> 00,02winglets dont work
<Wrek> 051 sec
<Phase4> 00,02i'm using them as landing gear
<Golakka> BAD IDEA!
<Wrek> 051. Promotion of superstition and mythology
<Wrek> 052. Promotion of violence due to too much violence (I'm not exaggerating this is exactly what they wrote).
<Wrek> 053. Abolishing the deformation in sin.
<Wrek> 054. Demonstration of inappropriate clothing and slutty outfits for female avatars.
<Nyst> Then what is your ASAS controlling?
<Golakka> You have GOT to come on soft Phase4 or you are boned
<Golakka> like, <2ms
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, huh
<AdamTheDuck> Lol that 4th reason
<PsychoticDoc> wrek what was that from?
<Serenity> Wrek: Yeah, I noticed Blizzard get Slutty with females :/
<Dark_Horst> what is iran anyway?
<Serenity> It's a country
<Serenity> Next to Iraw
<Serenity> Iraq*
<Dark_Horst> oh THAT iran
<Phase4> 00,02close
<Phase4> 00,02getting close
<Phase4> 00,02very close
<Golakka> Remember, 10% throttle does not burn 90% less fuel in KSP now
<Dark_Horst> i thought this was about some website xD
<Golakka> it burns 900% less :D
<Golakka> Due to a glitch in the code
<Phase4> 00,02wont need much fuel to get home
<Golakka> 10% throttle doesnt use 10% fuel drain
<Phase4> 00,02still using more than i want to
<Golakka> it uses 1%
<Golakka> You should get mechanical jeb, if it still works
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Golakka> Do airbreathing engines still work in space?
<cowvarkian> sure
<cowvarkian> why not
<Golakka> They used to...
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<Phase4> 00,02njot in new versions
<Golakka> Thank god for that!
<Nyst> From what I know of ASAS is that it controls normal SAS, winglets and gimbals, but doesn't do anything itself.
<Golakka> That was just idiocy, Flying the the mun on scramjets
<Nyst> So I wonder what it's doing here.
<Golakka> slower!!!
<Golakka> thats good :D
<Golakka> stay near 1ms with winglet gears
<Nyst> I mean, I see no normal sas or gimbals, and the winglets don't work on Mun.
<Phase4> 00,02FSCK YEAH
<Golakka> this looks manual
<Nyst> SUCCES!
<Serenity> FSCK?
<Golakka> nice!
<Dark_Horst> touchdown
<AdamTheDuck> Nice :3
<Golakka> A round of aplause for Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02i was manually piloting it
<Golakka> NOW DO AN EVA!!!
<Phase4> 00,02using sas for stability
<Phase4> 00,02cant eva :P
<Phase4> 00,02demo version
<Nyst> Appropriate music!
<Nyst> Omg
<Golakka> daww
<Wrek> 05ok so
<Phase4> 00,02i've got the full version but wanted to try demo landing
<XAXzzz> Night gentlemen.
<Wrek> 05it was announced on the news in Iran
<Serenity> So, what do you do on Mun with Demo?
<Wrek> 05those were the reasons posted
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, nothing
<Nyst> You did all this on the DEMO version?
<Wrek> 05someonem with internet access relayed it
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight XAXzzz
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Nyst> Amazing.
<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, interesting
<Serenity> Wrek: Hey, welcome to hell. This world is buggered up.
<XAXzzz> Wrek: Lol'd at the second reason.
<Phase4> 00,02i'll take a look at that after returning
<Nyst> The music fits so, so well.
<Phase4> 00,02HOME TIME
<Golakka> Tbh, Im more of a spaceplane guy than a rocketeer
<Dark_Horst> so yeah, if you bought anything from blizzard down there, you're fuckt now. except you know how to proxy
<Golakka> I still havent achived a stable orbit with a vertical launched rocket
<Nyst> Nice camera angle!
<Serenity> Proxy servers aren't THAT hard to set up
<Phase4> 00,02getting close to not enough fuel
<Serenity> If the schools can do it, anyone can do it ;)
<XAXzzz> Dark_Horst: need to l2proxy
<Golakka> However I have been to the mun many times, Once to minmus with an airbreathing SSTO
<Dark_Horst> i doubt he has the fuel to make it back
<Chrysalis> inb4 stuck in space
<Golakka> Use as little throttle as you can to accelerate
<Nyst> Isn't he going in the wrong direction?
<Dark_Horst> yay for moon gravity
<Golakka> you will use disproportionatly less fuel
<Serenity> Oh, I know what he's doing
<Serenity> Is he using the orbit to get momentum?
<Nyst> Is he going to slingshot around the sun?
<Dark_Horst> Nyst: aiming for orbit entry
<Chrysalis> hot damn
<Chrysalis> nice one phase
<Dark_Horst> Nyst: see? there
<Serenity> Then once the momentum is done, he buggers off to home
<Golakka> Clever bastard Phase4 , nbice music aswell
<Nyst> Huh, how did he do that?
<Golakka> Magic :D
<Dark_Horst> Nyst: steer
<PsychoticDoc> this is a geocentric based game by looking at this
<Wrek> 05using proxy is probably punishable by X
<Phase4> 00,02turn aroudn mid flight
<Golakka> Quite a bit of luck aswell
<Wrek> 05besides
<Phase4> 00,02have enough fuel to land in the sunlight so why not
<Wrek> 05if you have an blizz authenticator the rapid IP changes will lock your account
<Phase4> 00,02SURPRISE PLANNET
<Serenity> Hmm, that sucks
<Chrysalis> where did that come from?
<PsychoticDoc> ooo gettin fancy
<Serenity> Oh god
<Buytoast> wait, Iran banned battle.net shit?
<Serenity> The G this is gonna be
<Nyst> That's a pretty early disconnect.
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, kerbals survive infinite g
<Dark_Horst> Buytoast: they did
<Wrek> 05Buytoast yeh
<Buytoast> ahahaha
<Serenity> Phase4: I know that, considering I went 36g at one point
<PsychoticDoc> yes, but do parachutes?
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, i once hit 50 :P
<Wrek> 05anyoen here read arabic?
<Phase4> 00,02PsychoticDoc, somehow yeah
<PsychoticDoc> lol
<Wrek> 05well i think its arabic but meh
<Serenity> Wrek: Google translate is your friend
<PsychoticDoc> so many times my parachute got ripped off of my rocket trying to land or whatever
<Wrek> 05dont trust google translate
<Serenity> It may be innacurate, but at least it gives you the basic idea
<Nyst> Yeah but how do you type the arabic into the translator? :p
<Wrek> 05i know how easely it fucks up anything that isnt english
<Serenity> Just copy and paste
<Wrek> 05besides its from an image
<Wrek> 05and not text
<Serenity> Ahh
<Golakka> I wish they put re-entry plasma into KSP :D
<Flyboy> Wrek: i must ask you something. if i supplied you with a base pony, could you make a desktop pony for me?
<Golakka> That would look awesome
<Nyst> The might do so eventually
<Flyboy> Flyboy: all you would need to do is animate it
<Flyboy> oops
<Serenity> Parachute, NOW.
<Golakka> Nah, too high
<Flyboy> that was to myslef 0.0
<Phase4> 00,02you can wait a bit
<Nyst> Right now you can land an eva'd kerbal without him burning up
<Phase4> 00,02let the speed drop
<Wrek> 05Flyboy nope, cause i dont make desktop ponies
<Flyboy> Wrek: who does then?
<Golakka> True Nyst
<Nyst> I've opened my parachutes as low as 400m and survived.
<Serenity> Pretty sure Vordox knows how.
<Wrek> 05cause http://i47.tinypic.com/2lktnqx.jpg
<PsychoticDoc> tis the end of the flight of the the U.S.S. Dico
<Serenity> Hahaha
<Nyst> Did...the parachute just explode?
<PsychoticDoc> Disco*
<Flyboy> was that supposed to explode?
<Serenity> Nyst: Yes
<Major> Rawhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiidddddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee~
<Kandarihu> Exploding parachute, lawl
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, eyup
<Nyst> Hah, those crazy Kerbals.
<Nyst> Explosives in everything.
<Phase4> 00,02der we go
<Phase4> 00,02dats my rocket
<Nyst> pretty
<Phase4> 00,02i like it
<Serenity> Needs moar thrusters
<Phase4> 00,02especially during take of
<Spell-of-Gaming> hai everypony :3
<Nyst> I played the hell out of the demo.
<Phase4> 00,02the upper solids burn three of the lowwer ones off
<Flyboy> So does anyone know how to make a desktop pony? i dont have the means to do it :(
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Spell-of-Gaming
<PsychoticDoc> Well guys, yet again i must walk to school, see you all around later today
<Nyst> I bought the full game a little while ago, but there's so many new parts that I don't understand yet.
<Flyboy> PsychoticDoc: bye
<Phase4> 00,02Flyboy, just normal gif files and some stuff
<AdamTheDuck> Bye PsychoticDoc
<PsychoticDoc> Bahhh
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, they're quite easy to use, most of them are the same as other stuff or plane parts
<Flyboy> Phase4: i cant do it myself so i need someone who has experience to do it for me.
<Serenity> I made a gif of Soldiers Colourful adventure
<pony_9011> maby you can make a desktop pony in cs4 flash
<Serenity> You can't
<Nyst> Well yeah, it's just that I can't tell the difference yet.
<Serenity> Flash works on vector imaging
<pony_9011> aw
<Nyst> Is one capsule better then the other? No idea.
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, ones bigger
<Phase4> 00,02for the bigger parts
<Phase4> 00,02i like dis rocket
<Phase4> 00,02gona have to try it again some time
<Phase4> 00,02hmmm
<Phase4> 00,02more ksp or different game
<Phase4> 00,02different game
<Nyst> I try to have several solid fuel stages; usually one for each athmospheric layer.
<Nyst> Each row needing to take me past one layer.
<Phase4> 00,02i've never managed solid fuel
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02i did once
<Serenity> Solid fuel is a bitch
<Nyst> powerful though.
<Serenity> Powerful and heavy
<Phase4> 00,02incredibly usefull
<Phase4> 00,02just not so easy
<Serenity> And a bitch to balance the weight power ratio
<Nyst> It leaves lots of liquid fuel for actual space travel and maneuvres.
<Phase4> 00,02not beyond boost on takeoff though
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, how bout this rocket
<Phase4> 00,02it'll load in a minute
<Serenity> I want a better laptop q.q
<Nyst> Yeah after you leave the athmosphere they're not very useful. Still I tend to keep at least one in space for emergencies.
<Nyst> And fun.
<Phase4> 00,02the one solid rocket design i've made that works
<Flyboy> Serenity: did you say vordox knows how to make desktop ponies before?
<Phase4> 00,02lets try it
<Nyst> That looks interesting.
<Serenity> Flyboy: I can't confirm it, but I'm sure he knows a thing or 2 about it
<Nyst> It must create so much drag!
<Rain_Down_On_Me> Hi :P
<Flyboy> Serenity: ima see if he can make one for me
<Rain_Down_On_Me> Derp my ass off derp :P
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Rain_Down_On_Me

<Rain_Down_On_Me> Rocket explosion
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Malavolent
<Chrysalis> Phase4 that was awesome
<Rain_Down_On_Me> :P
<Serenity> Phase4: Ever made it to Murz yet?
<Rain_Down_On_Me> I WANNA DERP
<Phase4> 00,02no murz
<Rain_Down_On_Me> :P
<Serenity> Not sure what the canon name is
<Phase4> 00,02wish there was one
<Nyst> Phase4: do you use a joystick?
<Serenity> Phase4: Pretty sure they added Mars
<Phase4> 00,02Nyst, dont have one
<Rain_Down_On_Me> :|
<Phase4> 00,02Serenity, the have minmus but its another moon
<Serenity> Ahhh, okay
<Nyst> A green moon :)
<Phase4> 00,02only one body orbiting the sun
<Rain_Down_On_Me> Can someone tell me why trixie is so popular :?
<Phase4> 00,02its easy to get to minmus
<Phase4> 00,02anything mun capable can probably do minmus
<Rain_Down_On_Me> WHEN IS IT GOTING TO FUCKING START?
<Serenity> Rain_Down_On_Me: Because it's Meanwhile's favourite character :3
<DaringDerpy> Rain_Down_On_Me: the owner of eqd, the central brony blog, is a huge trixie fan
<Rain_Down_On_Me> NIGGA STOLE MY NAME
<Nyst> I hope more planets get added soon. Murs, Kobos and Keimos, Maturn and rings maybe?
<Rain_Down_On_Me> NIGGA STOLE MY NAME!
<Engi> Fuc eqd
<Engi> *fuck
<Nyst> Kluto.
<Rain_Down_On_Me> Go get your own name >:3
<Flyboy> not that keen on trixie. she made the mane 6 look bad. well... most of them...
<Gold_Demona> G'morning Bronystate
<Phase4> 00,02howzat
<Rain_Down_On_Me> Mornin'
<AdamTheDuck> Good morrow Gold_Demona
<Phase4> 00,02orbit with nothing but solids
<DaringDerpy> is this one of these pathetic 4chan troll raids?
<Rain_Down_On_Me> :D No
<Phase4> 00,02not a bad orbit either
<Gold_Demona> Yay! More Kerbals
<Nyst> that is a really cool disconnection.
<DaringDerpy> hi Gold_Demona :)
<Rain_Down_On_Me> erm...Where are the ponies?
<Nyst> Oh! And spacestations! We need those.
<Flyboy> Rain_Down_On_Me: read the rules...
<DaringDerpy> no ponies here. move along citizen!
<Rain_Down_On_Me> aw
<Phase4> 00,02landing time
<Flyboy> or faq
<Rain_Down_On_Me> :'(
<pony_9011> what is this game
<Serenity> Ooh, just got a streetpass hit
<Serenity> Weeeeeeee
<Rain_Down_On_Me> I wish there was a theater about derpy :P
<pony_9011> looks fun
<AdamTheDuck> pony_9011: Kerbal Space Program
<Gold_Demona> No defiance of physics this time?
<Rain_Down_On_Me> Ikr
<pony_9011> thanks
<Nyst> So my imagination is going mad, but hear me out. You land a bunch of crap on Mun. Fuel tanks, capsules, etc. Then, you use a rover to push it all together, and pretend it's a Munbase!
<DaringDerpy> derpy gets no love here :(
<Rain_Down_On_Me> NOOOOOOO
<Rain_Down_On_Me> But derpy is the best :P
<DaringDerpy> they even have a "spike" room. everyone hates spike. but no derpy :(
*Gold_Demona gives DaringDerpy a hug
<DaringDerpy> :)
<Serenity> Nyst: Only with less hilariously terrible text to speech
<AdamTheDuck> DaringDerpy: But Spike is best pony :D
<Phase4> 00,02should be fun
<Nyst> johnmaddenjohnmadden.
<Rain_Down_On_Me> WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY WHYYYYYY
<Serenity> uuuuuuuuu
<Flyboy> spike might as well be part of the mane 6. he is in almost every episode
<Rain_Down_On_Me> EVERYPONY HATES SPIKE
<Flyboy> i dont hate spike
<Rain_Down_On_Me> BUT EVERYPONY LOVES DERPY SO WHERE IS SHE :P
<DaringDerpy> spike is a lizard, not a pony
<AdamTheDuck> Spike is best pony :|
<Gold_Demona> Spike is best pony. Hank Green said so.
<Flyboy> he seems to be the only one with common sense
<Rain_Down_On_Me> Spike is a dragon
<Rain_Down_On_Me> Dumbass
<Serenity> dragon = lizard
<DaringDerpy> overrated lizard
<Serenity> Get your facts right.
<Rain_Down_On_Me> lol
<AdamTheDuck> Common sense, so fucking rare it's a super power.
<Gold_Demona> Rain_Down_On_Me: We know. That's why it's funny
<Nyst> Put a space station in orbit full of fuel, connect fuel pipe to landing strut, and you can refuel ships in orbit (not really but just think of it!)
<Rain_Down_On_Me> Nothing makes sense in ponyville
<Serenity> Failed
<Rain_Down_On_Me> Nice music?
<Serenity> Oh, guess not
<Cypresswolf> nothing makes sense here either
<Rain_Down_On_Me> ikr
<Flyboy> hears scotland. punches nearest guy in tha balls8
<Serenity> I can make sense of everything
*AdamTheDuck loves and tollerates Rain_Down_On_Me. Does it need to make sense? :P
<Rain_Down_On_Me> He's landing :D
*Serenity stabs Flyboy in the face with a bayonet
<Rain_Down_On_Me> No it doesn't
<Rain_Down_On_Me> HAHAH
*Gold_Demona drinks scotch.
<DaringDerpy> and then frogman drowned
<Jmo> Dat Gold_Demona
<Serenity> I'm in Scotland right now
<Jmo> :O
*Flyboy blocks it with a kilt
<DaringDerpy> oh...it lands on the ground
<Nyst> Ooh, a beach landing.
<Rain_Down_On_Me> I wish there was a Luna theater too :P
<Flyboy> Serenity: i know. I LOVE SCOTLAND!
<DaringDerpy> seconded, Rain_Down_On_Me
<Rain_Down_On_Me> HE LANDED
<Flyboy> celestia is best dictator
<Rain_Down_On_Me> <Rain_Down_On_Me>
<Nyst> The Kerbonauts can get out and get a tan.
<Serenity> I think 7 rooms is just fine
<AdamTheDuck> MOAR ROCKETS :D

<Flyboy> Phase4: crash into the earth! you are in command of a doomsday rocket!
<Spectrum_Speed> HAHAH IT BURNS!
<Phase4> 00,02so
<Serenity> If you was a person, you would be reduced to ectoplasm
<Phase4> 00,02build a bigger rocket and beat that record?
<Spectrum_Speed> What chat you on?
<Sylandest> 85.9 g's turns us into kerbals?
<Spectrum_Speed> You got 2 chats
<Cypresswolf> what would 86 G's do to the human body?
<Chrysalis> Phase4 try for a speed record!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Someone want a random link?
<Phase4> 00,02Cypresswolf, it wouldnt be a human body afterward
<Serenity> Phase4: Don't change any stages that you can, more stages, higher terminal velocity
<Spectrum_Speed> KERBAL PNIES :D
<Spectrum_Speed> *ponies
<Serenity> Cypresswolf: You would be a red pile
<DaringDerpy> it would weigh 86 times its original mass
<Spectrum_Speed> waiting

<Phase4> 00,02adding some
<Spectrum_Speed> Or at least put different music
<Serenity> Ohfor fucks sake
<Serenity> All she got was Beefburgers

<Spectrum_Speed> Its a horrible song
<Cypresswolf> DaringDerpy: I was thinking much hight :P I try to avoid the custom plushies, their too expensive and beyond my ebay limit
<DaringDerpy> no one joined your game, Cypresswolf?
<AdamTheDuck> Wait... what song is horrible?

<Serenity> That's impossible
<Phase4> 00,02i might achive kerbin escape with this
<AdamTheDuck> Spectrum_Speed: Oh you're new? :o

<Vivix> yes! While vacuuming couch I found my hoof nail horse shoe thingy- I was wondering where that got to
<Jmo> o.O
<MadSurge> Vivix: Hooray! Lost and found!

<Jmo> Be the vacuum Vivix.
<Vivix> I was puttin it away! Plz
<Jmo> o.O
<Vivix> hehe, I still have more thing I should do-
<Vivix> Thing is, my room ain't finished, so I can't move any of my big stuff- so no matter how much I clean this livingroom looks messy
<Jmo> Go messy.

<Golakka> I LOVED your drawing of pirate raity on the stage
<StinkomanFan> Vampire Hunter Rarity?
<StinkomanFan> Oh, Pirate
<Golakka> Depending on how this turns out Wrek, I may need to buy this off you and frame it
<Wrek> 05then imagine that someone somewhere owns a hand drawn skethc of this very image
<spitfirecolt> i was hoping next buck when i go wrek can show me around never been over seas
<Golakka> Im mad right now
<Dovah> Morning Everypony.

<CCCP> Bye bye everyone :'(
<Jmo> Take care CCCP
*CCCP hugs Jmo
<Lil_B> nye CCCP :)
<Lil_B> bye *
<spitfirecolt> bye
<Vivix> When I was in school, our teacher would berate us if we used A4 to draw, everything had to be A3 or A2
<Vivix> after a while--A3 started seeming tiny- really helped you to get a sense of details and size in drawing
<Golakka> I used A4 for paper aeroplanes :D
<Vivix> Hehehe
<Golakka> Im not one for blowing my own trumpet, but I was bucking good at making them :D
<Vivix> I was teerrible
<Vivix> They'd always go nose first into the ground, right infront of me
<Golakka> hmm, Wrek, Maybe a fire ruby in the buckle?
<Golakka> I made a plane that you threw upside down :D
<Vivix> !
<Jmo> o_O
<Golakka> The way i folded the wings, made a MOTHERBUCKING RAMJET!
<Vivix> nice
<Vivix> when I was iin--kindergarten I think, my dad has a program on his computer that had like a database of various paper planes
<Golakka> its stupidly simple
<Vivix> really weird ones- and it would print like guides
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01A#?
<Golakka> normal two fold nose paper plane
<Golakka> so, 27.5 degree nose angle
<Golakka> standard wings
<Golakka> however, you folded the wings into the body
<Golakka> then folded the wingtips into the first fold
<Vivix> aah
<Golakka> made a 3 sided box on the wingtips
<Golakka> you then throw it upside down with all the force you can muster
<Golakka> incredibly fast and stable
<Vivix> nice-
<Pink> Oh my...
<Golakka> could easily take somebody eye out :D
<Vivix> If I still had A4 I'd try that now
<Pink> There are other people alive? :O
<Vivix> I only have A3 akvarell from school, rest is digital
<Jmo> Nop, everyone is dead.
<Golakka> It only seems to work in A4
<Jmo> We're a part of your imagination
<Vivix> We're zombies and ghosts
<Pink> phew
<Golakka> never tried it larger
<Pink> I was scared there for a second
<Vivix> I think A3 and such is horrible for paperp lanes, too flimsy
<Golakka> and on that note, I tab back into KSP as watching ponies being drawn in a buisy internet cafe in glasgow is not a good idea :D
<Vivix> A3 Aquarell mighit work thouh, that's really stiff
<Pink> Ooohhh ponies!
<Vivix> Hehehe
*Jmo tackles Vivix
<Vivix> Also A# Nittany?
*Vivix is constantly wounded and in pain from tackles
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Whatever your A numbers are. What are those?
<Wrek> 05international paper sizes nitt
<Vivix> European paper sizes- eh A0 1 2 3 4 5, A4 is the standard printer size
<PillowPoni> (Cucumber melon)
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K Wrek.
*Pink just came from canternet.org
<Vivix> I think a4 is 27mm x..18?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Golakka: Were you the guy that requested this drawing?
<Pink> I figured I'd broaden my horizons
<Maid_Rainbow> Wrek : i never seen Rarity this Sexy
<Jmo> Suck it up Vivix.
<Pink> Clearly I made the right choice
*Vivix whimpers
<Golakka> No, I wish i was Nittany_Discord
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01K.
<Golakka> I was the blueshirt that was standing watching in awe on the stairs
*Jmo glomps Vivix
<Wrek> 05Maid_Rainbow: how about liek this?
<Golakka> the guy that got Gildash and denegoth on stage :D
<Maid_Rainbow> Wrek: yes
<Maid_Rainbow> Wrek : but that Pirate Rarity has something els
<Golakka> Gildash hates me now :D

<Barbetos|AtWork> Not sure if you spelled it normally or backwards
<Jmo> I will sit on your head and eat a muffin.

<Vivix> Holy Grail is great
<Jmo> On my to-do-list.
<Vivix> I saw it with my much older cousin and his creepy grunge friends
<Tervicz> It's the one with the murderous rabbit
<Vivix> And "A witch weighs as much as a duck" something
<BronyInstrumental> i don't really 'do' solos, i'm more partial to doing rhthm myself :)
<mitamaking> Murderous Rabbit? Watership Down?
<Boltasar> and the french
<Vivix> BronyInstrumental: I stoppe ddoing solos for like-- 3 years, but now I like some of them
<DoctoDoctorWho> Is wreck still drawing?

<Barbetos|AtWork> Not sure if sexy.
<Barbetos|AtWork> AGH I MADE IT WORSE!!
<Vivix> Old timey firefighter?
*Barbetos|AtWork pounds face into keyboard
<DoctoDoctorWho> they said I could be anything I wanted, so I decided to become EVERYTHING!:D
*Vivix is mildly intruiged
<MadSurge> The music is making this an insanely dramatic drawing :D
<Jmo> Rofl.
<Barbetos|AtWork> I remember when Neville Longbottom said that
<Vivix> I really like the seams-
<Vivix> god I love those seams-
<Vivix> I need to try colouring- I usually only do sketches, and then say "I*M DONE!"
<Jmo> Do you like the seams?
<Vivix> I looove them
<Vivix> they look like texture work for games-
<Jmo> I really couldn't tell.
<Vivix> I know, right?
<MirrorImage> mornin' folks
<Jmo> Morning MirrorImage
<DoctoDoctorWho> Vivix: They do, actually
<BronyInstrumental> i might try my hand at some digital art, i've never done it before
<Vivix> Yeah- they're really neat-
<Vivix> I like digital, because whenever I do oil paint I get messy
<Vivix> but oil paint is so much sexier than akryl or--yeah
<Jmo> OILPAINT EVERYWHERE
*Jmo tackles Vivix
<Vivix> !
<alexxm> hey guys
<DoctoDoctorWho> when I first came in I thought it had a serious tf2 vibe to it

<Jmo> I'm good, yourself?
<PillowPoni> Hey alexxm. How are you w

<Vivix> yeah
<Jmo> Tis good.
<Vivix> Sai is great at colours
<cowvarkian> eH's a cool guy
<Vivix> I still kinda want Corel Painter, but- the dirty brush didn't work to me
<Jmo> Praise the almighty SAI
<PillowPoni> alexxm I'm fine
<PillowPoni> Just watching Black Dynamite
<BronyInstrumental> well, i have it installed but i've never needed it seeing as i was too scared of being mocked by my dad when i used his scanner for the sketch :/
<cowvarkian> I love black dynamite
<Vivix> Aah
<DoctoDoctorWho> its sad that he's putting so much effort into the outfit tho, cuz once that pony goes super saiyan its clothes will just explode
<cowvarkian> just saiyan
<DoctoDoctorWho> like a michal bay film...

<Thunder-Crescent> *gets back up and eates his own morning muffin
<Serenity> So need to reformat the drive

<Serenity> Canadian_Brony: My laptop has 4
<Serenity> umad
<Canadian_Brony> hi MaxTheBrony
<DoctoDoctorWho> srsly tho, what is this song?
<Vivix> I had 4GB for many years, and yeah games woul crash on me on W7, not to mention music software and animation stuff-
<MaxTheBrony> DoctoDoctorWho PM wrek :)
<Canadian_Brony> Serenity yes. That can play TF2 and Minecraft
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hllo MaxTheBrony
<Serenity> But unfortunately, my laptop has the worst CPU and graphics
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Canadian_Brony and MLP_Brovakiin :D
<cowvarkian> my computer doesnt like to use its better graphics card though, so I have to hook it up to a second monitor if I want to play any decent games on it
<AJIsAwesome> MaxTheBrony: Hello!
<Serenity> Canadian_Brony: Laptop can't run Minecraft
<Thunder-Crescent> i have 1GB can that play TF2
<MaxTheBrony> Heya AJIsAwesome
<Serenity> GFX isn't good enough
<MaxTheBrony> Is the smileys gone?
<MaxTheBrony> i cant see mine
<Serenity> You can run TF2 on 512
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Pink> Yes!
<Jmo> DoctoDoctorWho: Alex Rudi Pell - The Masquerade Ball
<Serenity> When it was first released, you could run it on 256
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix Vista and 7 hog more RAM then XP, but Vista takes the most.
*Pink gazes at the glory that is #bronystate in a real client
<Serenity> So yeah, right now I'm reformatting thr drive
<Vivix> Canadian_Brony: Yeah, W7 made it necesarry for me to have at least 8, and since 16 was on offer I got that
<Serenity> Gonna reinstall windows, then put in my chips
*Jmo pokes Pink
<MadSurge> Pink: are you new?
<RaveBrony> ^
<Serenity> Vivix: I'm running Windows 8 just fine on 4gb
<Jmo> You lost me at W8.
<Vivix> It runs fine, but I couldn't run heavy programs
*Pink pounces Jmo and squeezes him tightly
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<cowvarkian> I need to get some more hdmi cables, and to get my other monitor back from my brother because he doesnt use it
<Jmo> D'awwww
<Pink> MadSurge: Yes indeed!
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Jmo :)
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix duuuude . . . don't you think 16GB is, you know, overkill?
<Jmo> Heyo MaxTheBrony
<Serenity> HDMI Moniters?
<Jmo> Canadian_Brony, you can never have overkill.
<Pink> And such an interesting place I have found
<Serenity> What the hell planet am I om?
<Canadian_Brony> Jmo . . . okay that's true.
<Serenity> I still have a freaking TIME moniter
<Vivix> Canadian_Brony: noo, I eh- games sure yeah overkill, but it was cheap, and it helps me do longer takes on Cubase, which EATS ram like candy, not to mention other software like that
<MadSurge> Pink: :O this calls for a WELCOME PARTY!
<Canadian_Brony> Pink just wait until Movie Night.
*Pink "SQUEE!" glomps MadSurge
<Serenity> Even my TV isn't HDMI
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Jmo> o.o
<AJIsAwesome> Pink: You should see movie night. Much more epic.
<cowvarkian> wow
<Pink> Oooohhhh movie night?...
<Gold_Demona> Did somebody say PARTY? 8D
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix oh, yeah in that case it was probably "What the buck" amiright?
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<Serenity> But before I can reformat shitbox, I need to copy over my files
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Gold_Demona :)
<Jmo> Chat is officially alive.
<Vivix> Yeah, it only cost like--ehh 900kr wihich is--maybe 100 bucks? ANd - I had the money, and it would benefit my music software, so-- yeah why not
<Jmo> Huzzah~
<MaxTheBrony> Aww yeaah
<Gold_Demona> Hiya MaxTheBrony
<Pink> So uhm... Just a question
<Serenity> Copying over 100gb of crap onto my ExHD
<Pink> I don't mean to offend anyone but I have pretty good reason to ask
<Pink> How is the owner of this place?
<MaxTheBrony> do ask
<Vivix> Hm?
<Pink> Is he a real jerk?
<MaxTheBrony> Who?
<Canadian_Brony> Pink Fridays 7pm EST / 4pm PST. Also Saturdays 2pm EST / 11am EST.
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<Jmo> >.>
<MadSurge> Pink: so, welcome to Bronystate! Be sure to read the rules and enjoy your stay!
<XylemTube> I was watching MLP on The Hub just now, and they said "We're now back to My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. Now 20% Cooler". I got a kick out of it :D
<Serenity> Pink: Who don't you ask him?
<Pink> I come from canternet and the owner of the main channels is a real bad guy :(
<Vivix> No the admins here are usually pretty nice Pink, better than when I was on Fimchat
<Jmo> I'm gonna leave that for others to say.
<MaxTheBrony> The mods are not bad
<MaxTheBrony> here
<MaxTheBrony> :)
<AJIsAwesome> XylemTube: IKR?:D
<Pink> Phew...
<RaveBrony> Pink: All mods are great here, should you obey the rules :)
<MaxTheBrony> they are very kind and funny
<Canadian_Brony> Pink I've never asked that, but the mods keep the chat in sync and work the stream.
<MadSurge> Pink: the mods here are all nice people.
<Serenity> I've been here for a year, and I don't think any of the mods are dicks, mabye Sumica's characterisation, but heh
<Pink> LAst place I was in was pure cyberbullying by the owner of the channels...
<cowvarkian> they have some wierd rules sometimes
<Sumica> 00,10How dare you call me nice.
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Vivix> Hehehe
<MaxTheBrony> haha
<Serenity> dohoho
<Canadian_Brony> hi Sumica. O U
<Jmo> Aw Pink.
<Vivix> Pink: I've been to places like that, just couldn't be bothere to hang there anymore
<spitfirecolt> hay sumica whats up
<MadSurge> Pink: they might kick you once for trolling purposes, but that's it :D
<Gold_Demona> Sorry, Sumica isn't nice. Sumica is awesome!
<XylemTube> AJIsAwesome: i think it's nice to know that The hub is fully aware of the fandom here.
<MaxTheBrony> Im glad that i found this place :D
<MaxTheBrony> it makes me relax
<Serenity> Well, he's probably gonna burn me for waking him up
<Pink> He thought my art was ugly so if I posted it I got banned
<cowvarkian> ikr MaxTheBrony
<Pink> But lets forget that and move on to greener pastures!
<Jmo> o.o
<MaxTheBrony> Pink D:
<Vivix> !

<Vivix> so emberassing
<MaxTheBrony> I have never seen Golakka around :P
<Golakka> literally, I have a list of people I want to shit on
<Jmo> wat.
<Serenity> Oldest user I know other than the mods is probably Meanwhile or otakon
<Golakka> Im very rarely here MaxTheBrony
<AJIsAwesome> Wish I could've come here sooner. My life would've been so much happier......:$
<Pink> Hey uhm.. ARe there any RP channels or something?
<MadSurge> Pink: I think I know who it might be, but... who's your fav pony? :D
<Jmo> Pink: Dashiesauce
<BronyInstrumental> i've been here a while
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix you do know ValtheJean and Caramel are the same mod, right?
<MaxTheBrony> Ah
<Golakka> However, I am a minion of Saturn at buck
<cowvarkian> havent I been here longer then meanwhile?
<cowvarkian> meh
<Vivix> Canadian_Brony: yeah, I asked him who he was and he said "ValTheJean" and I was a qusetionmark, I'd seen his name but never met him or seen him chat
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix ah.
<Serenity> cowvarkian: I dunno, didn't you have a huge hiatus after a couple months after I joined?
<cowvarkian> sure
<AJIsAwesome> Pink: If you want to RP, type in "/me" before you type anything else. Just don't spam the RP. I made that mistake.:$
<spitfirecolt> valthejean is awesome pony
<cowvarkian> when'd you join serenity
<Vivix> yeah, full RP is eh not here
<Serenity> I'll take as a no I haven't, and Serenity is a fucking loonatic
<Jmo> AJIsAwesome, channels not how to RP >.>
<spitfirecolt> u guys are funny
<Jmo> Read ze question properly :<
<Serenity> cowvarkian: Around mid July last year
<Canadian_Brony> Vivix I have talked to all the mods except VioletVanilla. I've seen her name in the chat, but never saw any text
<cowvarkian> hmm
<cowvarkian> no, I don't think I've been here that long
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Vi hasn't been in lately.
<Vivix> Canadian_Brony: I saw her a few times when Ifirst got here, she speaks like half german english
<cowvarkian> but I dunno
<Serenity> Nittany_Discord: Vivi?
<Vivix> I'm not sure if I got a long with her, but I never really-talked to her
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: Whoops......:$
<Canadian_Brony> ohia Nittany_Discord. Darn, she
<Canadian_Brony> DAMMIT
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Nittany_Discord :)
<AJIsAwesome> Jmo: I make that mistake all the time.:$
<spitfirecolt> i love bronystate
<MadSurge> Canadian_Brony: that's because she usually makes awesome music, not talk :D
<Canadian_Brony> she's the last one on my list of mods to meet
<cowvarkian> I really may have been here for a year, I don't remember
<Jmo> It's alright AJIsAwesome ;D
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Canadian_Brony> MadSurge that would explain alot.
<Serenity> When I joined, Saturn was still a basic member, not a techie, or a mod
<Vivix> I'm usually never here to hear music, so I've never heard her stuff
<cowvarkian> silly memory why you no
*Jmo slaps Vivix
<Jmo> Be here more often.
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Vivix> ;__; I like noise and instruments
<Jmo> I pity the fool he don't visit often.
<Vivix> and they don't play that here- so I mute the stream pretty often
<MaxTheBrony> Music?
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Serenity> I'm often too busy to watch the stream
<Vivix> I love watching the stream, but I often listen to other things while watching
<Serenity> But I do drop in now and then to see what sexually arous..I mean interesting activities you lot are up to.
<cowvarkian> I actually stopped watching the stream alot after the season ended...
<AJIsAwesome> Serenity: :D
<Jmo> Vivix; What instruments do you plaaay
<RaveBrony> I always stop what im doing when wrek is drawing :D
<Vivix> I usually watch movies, episodes and when they play games
<MaxTheBrony> I am using wrek at the moment as a teacher :P he have shown me some new moves :)
<Canadian_Brony> I was about to add RainBroDash to the list, but I've talked to him once or twice.
<DoctoDoctorWho> Jmo: I PITY THE FOAL WHO DOUBTS WRECKS DRAWING METHODS!
<RaveBrony> Gets me to work on my artwork and try to improve myself :P
<Vivix> Jmo: bass, guitar, most fretted instruments, some drums and extremely tiny amount of keyboard
<Jmo> WRECKS.
<Serenity> DoctoDoctorWho: Well first, you need to spell his name right
<Jmo> WHAT IS WRECKS ;-;
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<BronyInstrumental> i'm not the music man, i come from up the road and i can plaaaay~
<Jmo> Vivix, learn the piano nao.
<Vivix> ;__;
<Vivix> I usually only play keys if I want synth in my songs, that makes for lousy practice
<MaxTheBrony> I know de piano :3
<Dark_Horst> first drawing i saw of wrek was a schematic for a rifle for a video game
<Jmo> The piano, such a wonderful instrument, touches my heart.
<BronyInstrumental> Jmo: i took 4 years piano lessons but i forgetted it ;__;
<AJIsAwesome> When I first came here, I was only here for the movies. However, as I visited here more often, I'm here much longer than I used to be. I'm glad I came to Bronystate.
<Jmo> Sif BronyInstrumental, Sif.
<Serenity> I remember seeing Wrek draw SB's first OC
<Jmo> You people make me wanna cry ;~;
<Vivix> Hehe
<AJIsAwesome> I love the piano. Been taking it for over 10+ years.
<MaxTheBrony> O.o
<Dark_Horst> i think i've been here pretty much since the beginning
<MaxTheBrony> Waow
<DoctoDoctorWho> I was speaking possesive, as in "those methods belong to Wreck"
<Vivix> I love piano, but I want to buy a proper piano vst before playing it-
<MaxTheBrony> Still Wrek :3
*Jmo flips Vivix
<Jmo> A REAL PIANO.
<MaxTheBrony> not wreck * ^^
<BronyInstrumental> i've been teaching myself guitar and bass for about 3 months now
*AJIsAwesome hands Jmo a tissue
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: stop being a dumbass and spell it right
<Vivix> I can't afford one ;__;
<Serenity> Dark_Horst: I guess you could say the same for me, if you count 2 months after it beginning
<Jmo> GAH
*Jmo glomps AJIsAwesome
<Dovah> DoctoDoctorWho: do it with me W-e-r-k. come on you can do it
<Vivix> I've been playing since I was 14, soo..9 years?
<PillowPoni> First time I watch Wrek stream is a pic of Vinyl Scratch and she way lying on a pile of pillows
*AJIsAwesome hugs Jmo back
<Serenity> Dovah: That spells Werk you hypocrite
<Jmo> I'm suppose to be reading damn it >.>
<MaxTheBrony> 14 + 9 O.o =23?
<Serenity> :3
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<DoctoDoctorWho> Ah, I see my grammatical error
<Vivix> 23, yeah
<Dovah> Serenity: lol oohs
*Canadian_Brony throws a book at Jmo
<Golakka> Dammit my stream froze hours ago and i didnt notice
<Serenity> 5 + 5 = fish
<Golakka> loading....
<Dovah> W-r-e-k
<MaxTheBrony> I knew it!
<AJIsAwesome> I only play the piano if I want to. I don't like when people force me to.
<cowvarkian> 2+2= 9
<AJIsAwesome> *when*
<Golakka> HOLY FUCKING BATSHIT ON A STICK WREK!
<Serenity> 2+2 is 10
<Dovah> Serenity: better?
<Serenity> DAH
<Golakka> I need this on my wall!
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: force breeds resistance, I'm glad I kinda fell into learning instruments, otherwise it would be a chore and I'd enver do it- probably
<DoctoDoctorWho> Serenity: silly filly, 2+2=fish, not 5+5
<AJIsAwesome> That Pirarity drawing is coming along nicely, Wrek.
<Vivix> I absolutely love to play drums, adore it, but since I moved I can't set up my kit here, neighbours are too close
*PillowPoni sad that she has to miss out on a Wrek stream because her computer is being an ass
<BronyInstrumental> bleh, digital art. i draw all my stuff by hand
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: I know. I'm learning how to play the guitar soon.
<MaxTheBrony> AJIsAwesome xD i see what you did there
<Serenity> DoctoDoctorWho: No, 5 + 5 = fish, 2 + 2 is 10
<Ponies47> Dem chat derps

<Serenity> http://i.imgur.com/35ve7.gif
<MaxTheBrony> Heya Ponies47 :)
<Serenity> This is my reaction this debate
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: It's a lot of fun, and when you know one fretted instrument, learning others go pretty fast
<Ponies47> Hey MaxTheBrony :3
<BronyInstrumental> AJIsAwesome: do you already have a teacher or a book? otherwise it's gonna take you a while
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Alright. I'll take your word for it.:)
<cowvarkian> serenity those colors hurt my eyes
<Canadian_Brony> hi Ponies47. Welcome to random plus stream. Mostly random.
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<DoctoDoctorWho> Serenity: ask emperor joker, he made it equal fish. get your math straight son!
<Vivix> I learned instruments by listening to music and reading tabs, only teacher I had was in 'college'
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: I LOVE RANDOM THINGS! :D
<AJIsAwesome> BronyInstrumental: I was thinking of buying some books, but could you recommend some?
*Canadian_Brony throws a muffin tin at Ponies47
<Dovah> http://i.minus.com/jvoXf5XSLjr30.jpg

<Serenity> Ooh

<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: I would recomend you learn how to read tabs, and just start out like that, free and easy, books can be confusing- I don't know any
<Serenity> I have a streetpass hit
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Ok.
<DoctoDoctorWho> AJIsAwesome: doesnt matter, the art of war would still help, somehow...
<BronyInstrumental> AJIsAwesome: and i've only been doing it for a couple months. seeing as i can play most songs now with a little practice, i think i've done pretty well for myself :)
<AJIsAwesome> Serenity: You have a 3DS?
<Canadian_Brony> Serenity lucky! I never get hits.
<Serenity> Yeah

<Vivix> Sometimes I play while reading fanfiction-

<Ponies47> Morning TheGreatAndPowerfulT :)
<Canadian_Brony> hi TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<killerpony7733> Serenity: Yup it has made the techy more defensive and explosive ish and the little repair thing is a good thing to put around when you can't get to a place quick enough
<Vivix> DoctoDoctorWho: It's not, but I just can't stand the taste anymore. Even hamburgers are disgusting unless they don't taste anything like meat- it's just odd
<MaxTheBrony> XD Lol Scream Pony music
<Vivix> Bacon is one of the few things I still love
<PillowPoni> That was an awesome stream to sit through

<Serenity> Jack? Jack Daniels?
<Canadian_Brony> Wrek in Canada, you can drink at 19 or 18, depending on the province or territory. 'Mericans and their high drinking ages, amiright?
<Vivix> Drinking was always a waste of money in my eyes-
<Vivix> 18 is drink, 21 is booze in Norway
<Golakka> I cannot drink beer
<Barbetos> Wrek there where a lot of people trying to take advantage of you =P
<Vivix> I think it's like that most places
<Jmo> I'm so proud of Vivix.
<Golakka> it makes me vomit

<Canadian_Brony> I can drink at 19
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Come to mexico we have tequila and you can drink as long as you are 18 or over
<Jmo> Go Australia with 18 laws.
<Serenity> In our country, if you aren't in public, you're actually allowed alchohol at the age of 5, as long as it's moderated by parents
<Canadian_Brony> Serenity :O
<Gold_Demona> I started drinking when I was 16, so I'd have been breaking the law in any country. lol
<SirGanjalf> k, bye for now
<Serenity> I think France is the same
<Jmo> Oh lord >_>
<Golakka> Erm

<Sumica> 00,10France has wine as part of a balence breakfast
<Golakka> the legal drinking age is 9
<DoctoDoctorWho> But 60% of all americans are the stereotypical dumbasses the world thinks we are and drink below 21 anyway sooo...
<Wrek> 05its ok sumica
<Serenity> Also, before you all call me a drunkard, I'm not. I hate drinking, I hate drinkers.

<Jmo> Well this is some interesting conversation.
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, here in the U.S. you're not EVER allowed unless you're over 21. Not even in the comfort of your own home
<GilDash|Gaming> Golakka: And that's 9 months, just to clarify for our members here.
<Serenity> Wrek: Why not just drag Sumica over the sea?
<Golakka> Yeah

<Canadian_Brony> Wrek you HAVE to go to Vegas! I'm 15 and I had a good time there! No drinks, no gambling. Even my 6-yr-old sister enjoyed it. You jsut have to know where to go.
<Sumica> 00,10if you dont it's just like any other city except you can get any thng deliverd at any time of the day
<RaveBrony> Im awful at gambling, but love it sooo muuuch

<BronyInstrumental> england is alright, i guess
<Canadian_Brony> Scoot-Scootaloo pfft, you can't drink there until 21. Up here, 19 or 18, depending on the province.
<Serenity> Englands a bit fucked up in the economical side, but we;re a lovely bunch, I assure
<PillowPoni> I would like to go to Europe in general.
<Gold_Demona> I'd love to visit Europe someday. Just have to win the lottery. :P
<DoctoDoctorWho> so Wrek where do u live again?

<Canadian_Brony> If I can save up enough, I would like to travel to Ireland.
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: You should. I've been to Canada, Argentina, and Japan.
<BronyInstrumental> CCCP: no one does, they're terrorists!
<Vivix> CCCP: It's weird, I think it has to do with religion and whether or not they are part of britain
<Vivix> before they were terrorists they were a political party, I think
*PillowPoni really wants to visit Japan
<Dark_Horst> fun fact: there'S a battlefield 3 server in the antarctica
<Vivix> Shin Eid? I can't remember
<CCCP> why do they care though Vivix?
<AJIsAwesome> PillowPoni: You should. Just be careful.
<Vivix> Dunno, I think they're holding on to a sort of "We aren't british" nationalism thing
<Dark_Horst> say what you want, but this one wont have heating problems
<Derpy_at_work> http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v449/CaptRicoSakara/sorrowEdgeCommission1copy.jpg guess what game this is from :3 (warning minor gore is in this pic)

<PillowPoni> Ponies47 I wanna meet Saturn the most. He seems like the type of person that you can hang with all day and never question what you're doing
<Canadian_Brony> you don't want to know what I saw on my Vegas hotel's TV
<Vivix> its pay per view,
<Jmo> You'd know Vivix.
<AJIsAwesome> Barbetos: Sorta like that.
<Vivix> in germany its 16+ for softcore, so all the german hotels had softporn at evenings
<Jmo> >__>
<CCCP> Vivix O_o me gusta?
<Vivix> <,< I was a kiid I couldn't pay that
<Vivix> It was--weird
<BronyInstrumental> me no sure if gusta
<Jmo> I'M SURE.
<Vivix> we were on a school trip, so we were liek three guys glaring at it like O.o
<AJIsAwesome> Maybe we should change the subject............:$
<Canadian_Brony> defenitely not me gusta
<PillowPoni> Damn your crazy laws America.
<CCCP> Russian Laws are best Laws
<Ponies47> PillowPoni: Well if I ever do get to BUCK it will be kind of hard to say hello because first of all he will be running around alot and be VERY busy. But I'm pretty sure there will be a time you could dsay hell oand talk to him for a few minutes :P
<Vivix> British law: urine porn goes under obscenity law and can't be sold
<CCCP> Soviet*
<BronyInstrumental> as far as i can remember england doesn't have any pointless laws like america does
<Canadian_Brony> CCCP can you drink at 18 in some parts?
<MelaPonie> Serenity, what's wrong with minecraft?
<Golakka> Wrong BronyInstrumental
<Vivix> All countries have crazy laws
<Vivix> either oudated or not in use, or in use
<Pink> MMmmmbanana!
<MaxTheBrony> yeah
<MelaPonie> BronyInstrumental, i can name one! banning handguns...
<Serenity> MelaPonie: It's been ruined by some gamebreaking features
<PillowPoni> Anybody here been to Amsterdam? If so is it like the way its portrayed ib movies or is it different?
<Vivix> no banning hand guns is something all countries should do
<PillowPoni> In*
<BronyInstrumental> Golakka: well excuse me for not studying the legal system in my spare time >.>
<GilDash|Gaming> BronyInstrumental: England has so many pointless laws it's untrue. *Far* more then America.
<Golakka> Its legal to sword a scotsman weilding a crossbow in yorkminster square between the hours of mid-day and midnight on a saturday
<Spectrum_Speed> Nice music
<CCCP> Canadian_Brony It's legally to buy alcoholic drinks after 18 years. But this rule actually works only in some restaurants or in some cases when special inspectors are near.
<Spectrum_Speed> BAAAACK
<Serenity> Vivix: I agree. Would cut crime rate by 60%
<Canadian_Brony> PillowPoni no city IRL is the same in movies.
<Ponies47> Hey Spectrum_Speed :3
<Barbetos> Golakka that is oddly specific...
<Serenity> But also at the same time wouldn't do shit
<Vivix> Maybe, it would just--it makes no sense since you can't use it for hunting, and it's illegal to collect bombs, so why let peopel collect guns?
<Jmo> Canadian_Brony, Australia is o.O
<Barbetos> Some law maker was trying to save his own skin
<Spectrum_Speed> Who is streaming?
<Golakka> Yes, it is Barbetos :D
<Golakka> Its a law from the 1600s
<Canadian_Brony> Jmo I said no CITY.
<Spectrum_Speed> Dude nice drawing
<Jmo> Sydney is the same as in movies.
<Serenity> Only weapons that are legal in Britain are single shot rifles for hunting
<Canadian_Brony> hi Spectrum_Speed. Wrek.
<Jmo> That's no city, what am I thinking.
<Spectrum_Speed> Seriously nice drawing
<Spectrum_Speed> >_>

<Canadian_Brony> hi Fluttershy|
<Wrek> 05Spectrum_Speed: relax
<Spectrum_Rush> i've been here for a year
<Canadian_Brony> Spectrum_Rush better than having your entire name taken.
<Serenity> Spectrum_Speed: Pretty sure Rish has been here much longer than you
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: Be careful. Stuff like that can get you kicked.
<Vivix> I thouht maybe it was your "I'm on a different computer name Spectrum_Rush
<Spectrum_Rush> Canadian_Brony: AJIsAwesome stop tab failing
<MelaPonie> Vivix, what amkes you think handguns should be banned everywhere?
<Canadian_Brony> Spectrum_Rush t'is impossibru! Just ask Ponies47.
<Spectrum_Speed> Well i came up with this name on my own i did not steal it
<Serenity> I fucking hated this song on EBA
<Vivix> MelaPonie: they can't be used for hunting, that's about it
*Ponies47 Is getting confused by Spectrum_Rush and Spectrum_Speed 6_9
<MaxTheBrony> ^
<Spectrum_Rush> Vivix: I am always Spectrum_Rush no matter what computer im on
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Wait what?
<MelaPonie> Vivix, they most certainly can be used while hunting
<Spectrum_Speed> I saw it on one of my comments on my account :P
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: Then how come there are two Spectrums?
<Vivix> last I heard it was illegal to use them in hunting, for sake of teh animal, but I don't care about those laws much, so I don't know
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 how many times have I tab-failed your name?
<CCCP> Everypony is being put into the dictionary!
<AJIsAwesome> Spectrum_Rush: I was talking to Spectrum_Speed.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's spectrums, Ponies47. Spectrums.
<Serenity> Canadian_Brony: Yeah, I do it too
<Spectrum_Speed> IDK
*Spectrum_Rush is so confuse
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord I don't think that helps.
<Canadian_Brony> at all
<Spectrum_Speed> I just saw this name for a male rainbow dash and i liked it
<Ponies47> Canadian_Brony: Well with ponibas and I... ALOT! :D
<Canadian_Brony> Ponies47 exactly
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: Oh. And hi! :D
<AJIsAwesome> HUZZAH! THE SPECTRUMS HAVE BEEN DOUBLED!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I thought r63 RD was called Rainbow Blitz?
<Spectrum_Speed> -_-
<Vivix> Nittany_Discord: I think so, yeah
<Spectrum_Rush> NOT SO FUN FACT THERES ACTUALLY SOMEONE ELSE THAT GOES BY JUST Spectrum on this sight too
<AJIsAwesome> Nittany_Discord: You're right.
<Canadian_Brony> Nittany_Discord *blinks* first I hear of this.
<Spectrum_Speed> WTF 3 SPACTRUMS
<Spectrum_Speed> SPECTRUMS*
<Ponies47> Well R63 Applejack is called Applejack :P
<Spectrum_Rush> yeah
<MelaPonie> Vivix, when you have a bear charging you, what do you want... a S&W .500 Magnum at your side which you can pull and empty 5 or 6 half inch rounds into the bear... or a bolt action Remington 700 which gives you one, maybe 2 shots before the bear is upon you?
<Pink> PROTIP: Pink pony is best pony
<Serenity> I am fucking confuesed
<AJIsAwesome> HUZZAH! THE SPECTRUMS HAVE BEEN TRIPLED!
<MelaPonie> Vivix, where do you live?
<Vivix> neither, I wouldn't be there MelaPonie , I don't want to debate it
<Spectrum_Speed> STFU AND GTFO
<Vivix> Norway
<BronyInstrumental> the best r63 pic i saw was guy-ra
<Pink> :P
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: haha :D
<Spectrum_Speed> @AJIsAwesome SHUT UP
<spitfirecolt> guy ra is getting popular
<Spectrum_Speed> HOLY SHIT HIS PPAINTING IS GOOD
<Spectrum_Rush> Nittany_Discord: funny you should mentian that i came up with this name originally by think of a differen r63 nme for Rainbow Dash, other then Rainbow Blitz, though now Its the name for my oc
<AJIsAwesome> Calm down guys, just joking around.:S
<Bigjack> hi all
<Canadian_Brony> hi Bigjack
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Speed: CALM DOWN!
<MaxTheBrony> BronyInstrumental lol first i read it was r34 and i was like O.o
<AJIsAwesome> Bigjack: Hello!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Also, hi Ponies47
<Ponies47> Hey Bigjack
<MelaPonie> Vivix, interesting... so handguns should be banned everywhere in the world, don't confuse you with the facts your mind is already made up and will never change?
<Spectrum_Speed> I came up with this name by thinking rainbow dash as a man
<Bigjack> its Rarity as pirate ;D?
<Gold_Demona> Spectrum_Speed: IKR?
*BronyInstrumental slaps MaxTheBrony "NO"!
<Vivix> it will enver change, because I'm not interested in it. Whether or not the politicians change the law is up to them
<MaxTheBrony> :s How does he do that soft shadeing :s
<Jmo> YOU JUST GOT TOLD MaxTheBrony
<Jmo> TOLDDDD
<MaxTheBrony> :P
<Vivix> I'm also for banning hunting, mind you. So my opinions are pretty fucked on the matter
<Jmo> Vivix, soap.
<Serenity> ^
<Bigjack> what a programm yo uuse=?
<Spectrum_Speed> Me and rush got the half of the same name by the same idea -_-
<Serenity> Jmo: haha
<Jmo> Buzzkilled Serenity.
*Vivix washes mouth
<MaxTheBrony> Bigjack what program wrek uses?
<spitfirecolt> me to vivix
<Spectrum_Rush> Spectrum_Speed: small world aint it
<MelaPonie> Vivix, if you're not interested in it, then why do you have the opinion of ban them everywhere? i mean if you don't care why do you care?
<Canadian_Brony> I'm heading out everypony. I'll be back later.
<Serenity> Jmo: I was hoping you was referencing Rubberfruit
<Serenity> Go watch soap.wmv now
<Canadian_Brony> Thank you Wrek for the always awesome stream.
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Bye!
<MaxTheBrony> Bye for now Canadian_Brony :)
<MelaPonie> Vivix, you're the one that brought up hunting... not me...
<Ponies47> Later Canadian_Brony
<Gold_Demona> dem eyes
<Jmo> Here is an idea, let's hunt down Vivix with BB Guns.
<Vivix> MelaPonie: It makes me angry, for no eh legitimate reason. Handguns are made to kill people, for the most part, so I don't see why people should be allowed to have them at all
<Vivix> Nooo, bb guns hurt
<Spectrum_Speed> looks like an alien
<Spectrum_Rush> ya know now that i recall there actually another person on here, goes by the name Spectrum_Star
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Spectrum_Speed> 'FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<MaxTheBrony> Why so much Spectrum
<Serenity> Spectrum_Rush: There is
<Jmo> Vivix, this is for the good of Bronystate.
<Jmo> Give for the cause.
<Vivix> and since I get angry for no proper reason, I don't want to debate it- it's useless to have me on such a debate
<Vivix> Hehe
<AJIsAwesome> hUZZAH! THE SPECTRUMS HAVE BEEN QUADRUPLED!
<Spectrum_Rush> THE SPECTRUMS HAS BEEN QUADRUPELD
<Spectrum_Speed> Does anybody have a different awesome name?
<spitfirecolt> right on vivix
<MelaPonie> Vivix, handguns are made to kill people... sounds like a nice bit of propaganda
<Serenity> I'm thirsty
<Spectrum_Blitz> hey guys, what's going on?
<MaxTheBrony> :p
<Spectrum_Troll> Hi guys
<Vivix> MelaPonie: It might be, read above. I don't want to debate this because I'm unreasonable about it
<MaxTheBrony> dat troll spec , i think
<AJIsAwesome> Serenity: Maybe you should drink something.
<MaxTheBrony> xD
<Spectrum_Speed> FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<Spectrum_Rush> OH COME ON!!!

<Vivix> but I haven't tested write or read spee din ages
<Vivix> The only thing bad about my writespeed is that I hit space off beat, so I destroy words- and the anti ghosting ruins my T's often
<killerpony7733> Well for me it depends on what keyboard i use and all
<Vivix> I want a ps/2 mechanical keyboard
<Rohan> finally i can have my name without being bothered by tabfails

<Serenity> Well. Internet runs out later
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo Serenity
<Serenity> So won't be able to contact you for a week
<killerpony7733> Spectrum_Rush: Dayum straight now that's how to win a game of C&C
<AJIsAwesome> Serenity: Hello!
<killerpony7733> Ion cannon those fanatic nod
<Vivix> me and my friends used o play cold war in red alert 2
<Vivix> like build tons and tons and tons of nukes
<Vivix> and just wait...
<Vivix> it was pretty intense
<cowvarkian> so, you do nothing?
<cowvarkian> sounds fun
<Vivix> when we started running out of money, it was just- who fires first
<Vivix> nono, it was--constant paranoia
<killerpony7733> Vivix: I used to take the nuke general in C&C generals zero hour and just take a huge map and build a huge huge huge amount of nuke silos and infinite money cause of hackers
<Vivix> because whoever fired first was most likely goign to win, right
<Spectrum_Rush> killerpony7733: Vivix http://www.dark-circuit.com/random/data/media/3/ion%20cannon.jpg
<Vivix> Ooh, yeah, Generals was cool too
<Wrek> 05ANTHRAX WARHEAD IN PLACE
<Vivix> hehehe
<Serenity> ^ of course, Wrek
<killerpony7733> Wrek: BEHOLD THE BRINGER OF LIGHT!
*Serenity is drinking tea
<Vivix> CnC was fun..
<Vivix> it was the first eh..rts I played
<Vivix> probably one of the first games i played A lot-
<killerpony7733> I still have my first decade and C&C 3+kanes wrath etc
<Bronysith> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3lwbkcYmC1qdmo63o1_1280.jpg
<Serenity> The first game I ever played that I put more than 500 hours into is Simpsons hit and run
<Vivix> Yeah I bought First Decade too, because back then I only had demo
<Vivix> !
<Serenity> Infact, it still holds that record to this day
<Vivix> Nice
<Serenity> I have played no other game more than 500 hours :s
<Vivix> I think the game I've played the most over the years..must be fallout
<killerpony7733> Vivix: Oh and theres a huge fan made patch for first decade fixing having to use a CD etc etc etc
<Vivix> oh, nice
<killerpony7733> Vivix: remember the renegade game?
<Vivix> Yeah!
<killerpony7733> That game still has a small but very fun online community
<Vivix> I was so dissapointed that it wasn't RTS. I thouht it was like you could take controll of a soldier while playing- but yeah
<Vivix> the mp was fun, and it was fun on itself, but yeah I thought it was RTS + fps
<killerpony7733> Vivix: But yeah for a RTS ish FPS hybrid it's hard as heck when online cause you need to be smart and everything and use tactics
<Vivix> yeaah
<Vivix> I think some source mods tried that
<Ponies47> Back. Sorry about that. I'm home alone and I'm looking after 2 cats and a dog. :P
<Vivix> I remember one where Team A is run by RTS dude, one dude, with AI and shit. And Team B = players who run and hide and like.. rebels
<killerpony7733> Seriously stealth black hand with a group of 3 or 4 setting up nukes and succeeding is just......AWESOME
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Hi Ponies47
<Ponies47> Hi Nittany_Discord :3
<Vivix> Hehe, I was never able to play Renegade a lot online- mainly because back then we had ISDN
<MLP_Brovakiin> Welcome back Ponies47
<Ponies47> Thanks MLP_Brovakiin :3
<Serenity> My closest rival to 500 hours by the seems is Diablo II, with around 400
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Welcome back!:)
<Ponies47> Thanks AJIsAwesome :3
<Vivix> I can't count hours on my games- too long ago and too big a timespan
<Vivix> but I'm guessing longest I've played is fallout-
<killerpony7733> Vivix: The patch i told you about helps with that, But yeah god renegade is so much fun when you begin using teamwork and smart tactics. I can't tell you how much adrenalie you feel rush to your head when you manage to quickly take out their buildings with nukes or c4's
<Vivix> I don't think any of my steam games have passed 100 hours

<Sumica> 00,10still did't realy get much for it Chrysalis
<Spectrum_Speed> Dying of crying after reading my little dashie :'(
<cowvarkian> >.>
<Meanwhile> I generally delete crates on pickup.
<DoublePint> IKR Spectrum_Rush
<cowvarkian> I hear that that was terribly written
<Spectrum_Rush> oh for fucks sake
<Sumica> 00,10stickie jumper, cloak and dagger and pyros new bubble blower thing
<DoublePint> IKR Spectrum_Speed
<TheMaster> there are sadder things then my little dashie
<cowvarkian> Im one of those, Spectrum_Rush
<DoublePint> sorry rush
<Meanwhile> Spectrum_Speed: Overrated fic is overrated.
<Vivix> It's not the best, but people rack extra hard since it was so succesfull everyone was forced to read it
<Spectrum_Speed> Fuck you Meanwhile
<Terra> Meanwhile: thank you
<Vivix> I never read it because Human in equestria or pony in humanworld is not interesting to me
*Wrek slaps Spectrum_Speed around a bit with a large trout
*cowvarkian was the one who said it was horribly written
<Meanwhile> Pfft. Best answer I've ever received for my opinion of MLD.
<Spectrum_Speed> Fuck you Wrek:
<Meanwhile> Hahaha
<cowvarkian> oh, yeah I agree as well Meanwhile
<DoublePint> I dunno, while the writting was sub par it still had a pull somewhere
<Spectrum_Speed> Wrek you still working on that?
<TheMaster> if you want sad read eternal
<BronyInstrumental> i agree too Meanwhile, i mean it attempted to be emotional and i can see how it would be to some people, but i didn't get sad at all
<CCCP> BronyInstrumental lol
<Vivix> I absolutely have tons of issues with Device Heretic, I was never able to finish reading it withou getting my inbox bombarded by his damn blog updates
<Spectrum_Speed> What song?
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: MLD? I wasn't sad at all. I don't cry at stuff like that.
<Meanwhile> It's just cliché heartstring tugging. It has no real substance.
<Vivix> Totally ruined Eternal for me
<Sumica> 00,10got too damn many strange market gardners
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: I agree. It's too overrated.
<TheMaster> you subcribe to him or something?
<cowvarkian> ah, so I would probably laugh at it, meanwhile
<Spectrum_Speed> Eternal wasn't that sad for me at all :/
<TheMaster> I just read it off my phone
<Vivix> I wanted to read Eternal, but Device was such a dick to people around me that I just
<Vivix> I didn't want to read it
<DoublePint> Cliche or not it did evoke a level of emotions
<Chrysalis> welcome SlurryMoon
<BronyInstrumental> Sumica: the amount of market gardeners is TOO DAMN HAI!
<Meanwhile> What were you aiming for Sumica?
<cowvarkian> the bullseye
<Sumica> 00,10somthing not market gardner
<DoublePint> I'm not saying it was the best thing ever, but for a fan fic, surprisingly good
<Meanwhile> Pfft.
<Sumica> 00,10or even somthing not melee
<Vivix> I have no trouble with MLD, I just didn't read it
<Meanwhile> Anyone alive?
<AJIsAwesome> MLD is a good fic, but it's not the best. There never can be a "best". People have different opinions.
<Spectrum_Speed> Where will you post this picture when its done wrek? I wanna look at it
<MadSurge> 'MURICA
<Vivix> AJIsAwesome: yes, true
<Sumica> 00,10if soldier was ment to melee he would be in skyrim
<cowvarkian> AJIsAwesome: tell that to humans
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I have three strange weapons. They don't have many kills on them since two are melee and the other seems to be a crappy scout weapon (and I don't play Scout often).
<Vivix> For me, for instance, best fic ever was FoE, but I know plenty of people don't like it at all. Which is fair enough
<Meanwhile> What's the scout one Nitt?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Shortstop.
<cowvarkian> so... its grass?
<Spectrum_Speed> HE COPIED AND PASTED :O
<Spectrum_Speed> its fine
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: Fallout Equestria?
<Vivix> Yeah
<Vivix> That's- my personal favourite
<cowvarkian> mine too
<Sumica> 00,10never liked fall out
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Yeah.
<Meanwhile> Me neither. It's just not very interesting.
<Spectrum_Speed> I just hated fall out
<Vivix> Aww
<cowvarkian> Well, I only like it because Im a massive fallout nerd...
<Meanwhile> Yeah but I see you in mane anyway. :P
<Vivix> but yeah see, none of thoe points are invalid
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: It's not my cup of tea. It's nice considering that it's a well attempted crossover, it's just too much for me.
<BronyInstrumental> there aren't many people that play sniper on MvM. i can't see why, snipers are godly in MvM
<Vivix> Yeah, so- that's why we can't have a best in music, art, or anything. Too many different likes
<cowvarkian> again, tell that to humans, vivix
<cowvarkian> *insert any award show here*
<FillyFlam> Hi bronystate.
<AJIsAwesome> Vivix: I wouldn't say that. There can be personal likes as well.
<Vivix> Hehe, it's--fairly ignoreid I guess, but "best" is just a digure of speech most of the time
<AJIsAwesome> FillyFlam: Hello!
<Vivix> Oh yeah, of course
<Spectrum_Speed> HOLY SHIT that picture is going well
<Gold_Demona> Hi FillyFlam
<cowvarkian> hey FillyFlam

<Chrysalis> then i ended up on the panel
<Meanwhile> MadSurge: Wonderful.
<Golakka> "I am like Robin Hood, But a cunt"
<Spectrum_Speed> XD
<cowvarkian> If I had any reasonable source of income, then I would've gone there >.>
<Chrysalis> steal from the rich and you steal from the poor
<BronyInstrumental> i hope the panels will be better explained next year. i didn't know all bronystaters were allowed up to the panel :D
<Golakka> then spend it on ponies
<GilDash|Gaming> Chrysalis: That's the Scottish way. XD
<Golakka> I was tempted to jump up on stage
<Vivix> CCCP: What was the image? I'm really curious now- they almost look like explorers around Egypt-
<Golakka> but i couldnt be fucked
<cowvarkian> fucked = bothered?
<killerpony7733> cowvarkian: Pretty much
<GilDash|Gaming> Golakka: Why? Did seeing us being crucified stop you? XD
<Meanwhile> In this context, yeah.
<Chrysalis> GilDash|Gaming its also the government way
<Bronysith> unless its Saturn then it is not bothered
<Golakka> Nah, I needed a shit
<CCCP> Vivix it was some World War 1 image, they were some old Gas masks, wish i had more information on it
<BronyInstrumental> GilDash|Gaming: how were you crucified?
<Chrysalis> when you realise just how much the government take in taxes
<Vivix> CCCP: Aah, cool
<Chrysalis> you realise why some people refuse promotions
<GilDash|Gaming> BronyInstrumental: Let's just say it was a tough crowd. XD
<Spectrum_Speed> Wrek: Can you zoom out so i can see your picture?
<Golakka> and tbh GilDash|Gaming, I was too buisy to go on stage
<Wrek> 05Golakka

<CCCP> Chrysalis Any Rarity is amazing
<MadSurge> AJIsAwesome: the original Dr Seuss tale is better I heard :D
<AJIsAwesome> *its*
<Chrysalis> not as good as luna though
<kirzstryfe> the message behind the story is that explosive expansion at the expense of the resources and the world itself is a bad thing
<SonofaTimePony> Wait Until Dark
<CCCP> Rarity > Luna :3
