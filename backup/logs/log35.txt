<Microwave> So Autism to Moonbase, basically.
<Sol> Tastes like chicken
<MiniShot> I think they had to get rid of the burrows which they couldn't do with the carpet bombing
<HyperMetalLugia> I mean, they are useful for that purpose
<DarkMemories> This chat is always off-topic
<Lambda> it's for collectors, not gamers
<Bronypeanut> 13I didn't want to play Alien Swarm. Watch this. Now do.
<Senokai> Tastes like chicken!
<Stormy> Well yeah
<DarkMemories> So it doesn't matter too much.

<Senokai> Sol: Dammit you beat me.
<Sol> OSHIT
<xDaFreakshowx> What the?
<Stormy> But still
<Senokai> Bronypeanut: Same here.
<techdude300> 1 fps is the best way to watch this movie. It makes sure you dont overexpose yourself to suck.
<Senokai> BUGS
<DarkMemories> as long as we're of the adult chat's topics.

<DarkMemories> lol wut.
<AgnitioExMachina> So far...
<Bronypeanut> 13There's a 2nd one AND a 3rd one
<AgnitioExMachina> Ponies = caucasian
<AgnitioExMachina> Zeebas = African
<Ivan2294> Alicorn = God
<Silverscreen> 11A REMINDER EVERYPONY!
<SirSprinkles> 6Just some announcements, guys.
<Ivan2294> Unicorn = ?
<Ghosties> 4There will be a re-airing of the stream tomorrow at 2 PM EST
<AgnitioExMachina> Donkeys = Latino/Aztecs/w.e.
<DarkMemories> It's quite difficult to keep up with this channel while multi-tasking with others.
<Silverscreen> 11TOMORROW WE WILL BE RE-STREAMING
<SirSprinkles> 6HOPEFULLY WITH LESS LAG
<Ivan2294> Earth pony = ?
<Lambda> http://www.spyroforum.com/post-348894.html#348894
<Nightboomfer> Dwarves
<AgnitioExMachina> Ponies = land ponies, pegasi, and unicorns fyi
<AgnitioExMachina> Fuckfaces
<Silverscreen> 11THE SHOWING WILL BEGIN AT 2PM EST
<Ripred> 4thanks
<Lambda> here's that video I told you about earlier today
<AgnitioExMachina> Anyways
<Ivan2294> Yikes
<Ivan2294> Language.
<AgnitioExMachina> Buffalo = native americans
<Tacowiz> Where am I?
<AgnitioExMachina> And Horses maybe = Asian
<Silverscreen> 11THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATRONAGE AND HOPE YOU HAD FUN (as much as could be had with the lag)
<Tacowiz> What is this place?
<Ivan2294> okay
<Tacowiz> I'm confused.
<Ghosties> 4We thank you for attending, we hope you stay for the post-show
<Silverscreen> 11ALSO
<Nightboomfer> Stronger and hardier than the unicorns and Pegasi. Earth Ponies are dwarves. They can't do magic as well as unicorns, or fly like a pegasus, but they are tougher
<Tacowiz> Why am I bound and gagged?
<AgnitioExMachina> And Sapphire Shores is half black, half white
<Tacowiz> How can I type if I'm bound and gagged?
<Ivan2294> You were about to give me your money
<AgnitioExMachina> I mean half zeebra and half pony
<DarkMemories> There are no horses yet, I don't think.
<Nightboomfer> Is that why she has no cutie mark?
<AgnitioExMachina> Night, keep your dorky DND out of this
<Wierdplatformer> If you choose the blue pill, you'll wake up and believe whatver you want to believe...
<DarkMemories> Unless Big Mac is asian, Agnitio.

<DarkMemories> I only converted my sister, but, she's a girl who doesn't know how to internet properly so it doesn't count.
<Broonsbane> plaf?
<AgnitioExMachina> No Fallout is NOT abandonware
<CharlesAppleJackson> in other words Silverscreen, show it to him immediately
<Bunnylisk> Ze legs!
<rubenflonne12> captain N the game master
<CallingCthulhu> Oh my god. What's wrong with your HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIR.
<Ivan2294> FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<gingerninja> a french rapper, now ive seen everything
<Broonsbane> what kinda sound is "plaf?"
<ahmhappehplz> I'm guessing you do not enjoy surreal humor?
<GabeMoist> In that case, let the Nostalgia Critic see this right away
<AgnitioExMachina> Obsidian still sells the original Fallout and Fallout 2
<Darf14> Eeyup, this does look like a early 90's cartoon
<AgnitioExMachina> and the spinoffs
<Sol> Tha's me!
<Aponymous> Seriously, wat? I want to say something else, but all I can summon is wat.
<duMORI> IDK i think its slightly better than animated titanic
<Outline> They're pretty cheap though, iirc.
<Sathia> this is just horrible...
<TenSecondsFlat> 10 bucks for that pizza
<mib_xosqn3> this is really embarising...
<DarkMemories> By not internetting properly, I mean she uses just Facebook.
<B-Man> Meh, a brony's a brony.
<Bunnylisk> my god... the pizza man has no neck
<B-Man> Online or off.
<AgnitioExMachina> But imo, it shouldn't be abandonware anyways since its such an epic game
<DarkMemories> That's not internetting properly.
<Darkened_Path> lol wut?
<DarkMemories> xP
<SirSprinkles> 6This is getting stopped.
<Silverscreen> 11 10 buck?!
<RainbowSmash> I want some pizza.....
<GabeMoist> Oh god, The animated titanic
<Silverscreen> 11damn!
<Sol> Nice voice
<DarkMemories> She doesn't even know the term brony
<Sathia> great
<AgnitioExMachina> lol Dark
<SirSprinkles> 6It's just... what.
<Silverscreen> 11That better be a good pizza.
<SherlockHooves> for the love of all things holy stop this

<SirSprinkles> 6Unless ponies object.
<iloveponieswoohoo> damn this is gonna hurt in the mornin-- oh yea rite it's 06:16am
<B-Man> It doesn't make her any less of one.
<nah> 0why are you making me watch this
<Ivan2294> So, what good abandonware games are there?
<rubenflonne12> a helmet means he is genius
<DarkMemories> She doesn't know what 4chan is.
<Sol> Those are some legs from Starship Troopers!
<SonicRainboom> stop...please
<nah> 0do i owe you money or something
<Ivan2294> DOSbox stuff?
<Sathia> same here 6:16
<BigBob> please stop this
<Leoshi> I'd rather see the Dover Boyrs of Pimento University that...whatever THIS is.
<AgnitioExMachina> Well you can browse Abandonia
<mib_6033qz> It's the wrong trousers Gromit! The wrong trousers!
<Sathia> euro?
<Bunnylisk> Its his thinking cap
<Leoshi> *Boys
<Aponymous> His lips don't match his words.
<ahmhappehplz> I MO
<Darf14> @GabeMoist Which animated titanic movie?
<Outline> Dosbox stuff.
<AgnitioExMachina> It's got games sorted into genres
<SherlockHooves> it hurts so much
<DarkMemories> SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT AN OS IS FOR CELESTIA'S SAKE.
<Ivan2294> Awesome
<AgnitioExMachina> and alphabetical order
<GabeMoist> both of them
<DarkMemories> she can't computer very well.
<rubenflonne12> oh this one x3
<Sol> Watch Tentacles. It will kill your brain
<Ivan2294> Oh, have you heard of Battlezone?
<Outline> It's also worth checking out STeaM, and Atari ST emulator.
<DarkMemories> And she's 15.
<Zebranky> AgnitioExMachina: Obsidian doesn't. Bethesda gets the checks, I believe.
<CircuitMane> Wow, the intro had 10X more quality than the show did
<HaxBrony> dam add.
<ZSabotage1> thank god
<duMORI> both are bad the but one with the sharks is horrid
<rubenflonne12> its been a while since cheese has done a YTP
<iloveponieswoohoo> I need to get away from this, but i can't quite reach the button with the big red X on it
<DarkMemories> xP
<HaxBrony> had to ref
<SherlockHooves> ok I don't feel like I'm going to die
<Bunnylisk> og god... this one I remember
<Outline> There were a fair few good games on that.
<nah> 0we should watch Two Best Friends Play
<Zebranky> Also, Star Control 2. GOGOGO
<Silverscreen> 11Wow. You KNOW it's bad when THIS show looks so good.
<RainbowSmash> There were animated Titanic movies? Why have I not been informed of this?
<AgnitioExMachina> Zeb, good point but it's still being sold
<GabeMoist> the ones Nostalgia Critic reviewed
<AgnitioExMachina> and Obsidian made it
<SonicRainboom> Pinkazoid!
<Ivan2294> Anyone heard of Battlezone?
<Paperpony> I love two best friends play
<Zebranky> Yeah, they're definitely not abandonware.
<Zebranky> Black Isle made it.
<Darf14> The one with the talking dolphin and sharks it the worst one!
<Ivan2294> I FREAKIN' LOVED THAT ON N64
<nah> 0@paperpony brohoof
<AgnitioExMachina> Also Obsidian got to make Fallout New Vegas
<Silverscreen> 11RainbowSmash: There were TWO Animated Titanic movies
<Zebranky> Obsidian's a lot of the same people, but different.
<Sol> There's the bad one, then the worse one
<Twentypercent> lol
<Tyranico> Jim Cummings makes a better Robotnik
<HaxBrony> dafuq
<Ivan2294> And N64 versioned sucked, the pc version is AWESOME
<blackmagepony> is it just me or is "robotnlk wants KFC playing?
<AgnitioExMachina> Black Isle made it but Obsidian published
<blackmagepony> and why....
<GabeMoist> They were terrifying
<Zebranky> Obsidian didn't exist then, dude :P
<Sol> fapfapfapfap
<Sathia> talesss
<rubenflonne12> because its funny x3
<SavagePlatypus> evening everyone
<Zebranky> Interplay published it originally
<Darkened_Path> not funny.
<Dee_Twenty> Three if you count the sequel to the one with the evil talking sharks.
<AgnitioExMachina> Well...you got me
<duMORI> yeah TWO ones a bad rip off of the moive the second is just disturbing
<GabeMoist> We should watch them
<Bunnylisk> Yo!
<Ivan2294> AgnitioExMachina: Try Battlezone
<Zebranky> Obsidian was formed after Interplay closed Black Isle
<Sol> Yep, Tentacles
<HaxBrony> LOL
<Paperpony> >youtube poop funny?
<Zebranky> (I might be a huge nerd about their history ;)
<Sathia> such great art
<Leoshi> I'm now convinced that Grounder is the first Patrick.
<CircuitMane> I miss this show
<Aponymous> This is less wat, but still kinda wat.
<AgnitioExMachina> Someone knows Fallout history better than I do
<HaxBrony> dear god
<RainbowSmash> Are they even so bad it's good bad or worse?
<Darf14> Old school Sonic and Mario cartoons, back then it was one of the best console wars of all time
<Ivan2294> Trust me, it's the only game of it's kind, aside from the sequel
<Silverscreen> 11...

<Sol> Oh, not Japan!PMV
<Ivan2294> I honestly can't think of any other FPS/RTS Hybrid that worked.
<SherlockHooves> but I like the song
<blackmagepony> "my little evans" great mlp

<AgnitioExMachina> There's another one but it's so 8bit it's bad
<mib_xosqn3> the brady bunch ponie
<rubenflonne12> i miss the good old days for games, atleast duke cheered me up
<mib_xosqn3> s

<mib_xosqn3> yeah dnf is good

<Ivan2294> What about Wasteland?
<ST_Falcon> wasteland?
<Ivan2294> Wasn't that one?
<duMORI> DNF is ok
<HaxBrony> nicepeter
*DarkMemories begins to wonder how long it take for ponies to start posting links to pirated copies of games
<CircuitMane> @nah well that and some other random vids
<Twentypercent> the hitler vs darth vader one
<StarShine> Ugh, what's the command for Registering a Nick?
<duMORI> SS:BF will be more fun i think
<BronyJack> Got balls of steel ed but haven't gotten to play yet...
<Twentypercent> or chuck norris
<Ivan2294> We have yet to do that my friend
<HaxBrony> its /nick
<AgnitioExMachina> http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/436/Wasteland.html
<rubenflonne12> i love DNF it felt like a classic game

<CircuitMane> you do / and then nick and then whatever
<CharlesAppleJackson> StarShine /nick
<Silverscreen> 11EPIC RAP BATTLES OF HISTORY: RAINBOW DASH vs. APPLEJACK
<Dee_Twenty> DNF is okay, but nowhere near being good enough to warrant a $60 price tag.
<StarShine> Just Nick?
<DarkMemories> I know.
<HaxBrony> already liked that comment
<Misery> yep
<Dashite> DNF levels are too linear.
<Misery> worth 20 imo
<mib_xosqn3> silverscreen, i wish i could see it =(
<Ivan2294> Oh wow, that is some horrible graphics.
<Misery> 25 at most
<Misery> :p
<AgnitioExMachina> This wasn't the 8bit one though I was talking about
<ahmhappehplz> what is DNF?
<HaxBrony> cant wait to see it
<Misery> duke nukem forever
<AgnitioExMachina> There's worse than that Ivan
<ahmhappehplz> :
<DarkMemories> But it's only a matter of time until somepony gets the wrong idea.
<rubenflonne12> i got the balls of steel, was worth the bust and stuff it came with
<Misery> the new game they made
<BronyJack> Duke nukem forever
<duMORI> yeah I preorded on steam ges ago so...
<ahmhappehplz> ohlol
<Ivan2294> I'm ashamed that I let graphics get in the way of some great games.
<BronyJack> Carpe Nukem motherfucker!
<Misery> gearbox is a disappointing dev
<rubenflonne12> cheap too because of friends that work at a game store
<duMORI> DN3D
<AgnitioExMachina> There are no pirated games on Abandonia
<Dashite> For Balls of Steel here too. Worth it just to own Duke.
<Ivan2294> I almost didn't get X-Com because of that.
<Darf14> DNF = Duke Nukem FOREEEEEEEVEEEEERRRRRRRR!
<AgnitioExMachina> lol
<ahmhappehplz> serious sam is better
<Misery> at least he can hold 2+ guns
<duMORI> I need to torrent and see how it stands up tbh
<Misery> i love serious sam
<Irene> haha Serious sam is win
<HaxBrony> fayul
<Sol> DNF isn't good
<BronyJack> I heard that in Pinkie's voice
<AgnitioExMachina> Anyways there's a game that I wanted that became Abandonware recently
<rubenflonne12> duke will always have a place in my heart
<Silverscreen> 11Duke Nukem Forever. It looks good, IMO. haters gonna hate.
<duMORI> serious sam is better + 1291347557867909876543213456786543
<AgnitioExMachina> It's called CyberJudas
<Lambda> My bugs are all getting old and dying
<ahmhappehplz> he is the only serious action hero around
<Lambda> D:
<Misery> serious sam would snap douk in half with two of his fingers
<CallingCthulhu> I have a napkin on top of my head.
<CircuitMane> @misery actually I feel bad for them because they got handed a shoddy 12 year project and had to just polish it and send it out.
<rubenflonne12> i am enjoying it
<AgnitioExMachina> I'm just waiting for it to get uploaded now lol
<CallingCthulhu> :D
<rubenflonne12> way to much to unlock x3
<Bunnylisk> DNF would have been so much better if Pinkie Pie just jumped out every once in a while and shouted "FOREVER!"
<Ivan2294> I just want more people to learn of Battlezone.
<AgnitioExMachina> Not downloading it from torrent sites
<ahmhappehplz> lol
<Stormy> D:
<HaxBrony> do kahn vs easter bunny epic rap battle
<duMORI> DNF not worth the full price is soo short to say the MP is crap
<StarShine> 6I'm iffy on the whole Duke nukem forever
<blackmagepony> aw i love this
<Dashite> DNF isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.
<Darf14> Yay
<StarShine> 6YES

<Dashite> The yay is definitely the best part
<duMORI> yay yay yay yay

<blackmagepony> i i i i don't don't don't
<BlankFlankBrony> So... which abandonware game would you like to see revived and ponified?
<HaxBrony> has anyone else seen the rock band 3 adapt of this?
<Lambda> :D I'm happy
<Ivan2294> It's like Squad-based except on a larger-scale.
<OmegaPony11> Rainbow Six?
<mib_xosqn3> no
<rubenflonne12> i want also a remake of Duke 3D
<Ivan2294> No
<SonicRainboom> iiiidontdontdont
<Lambda> I know how much you liked that pencil
<Bunnylisk> *gasp* yay
<mib_xosqn3> i want it though
<Ivan2294> Not good enough.
<AgnitioExMachina> One of my favorites, Chromehounds, no longer has an online server though
<Ivan2294> Although I do like Rainbow Six
<Lambda> I'm glad you found it
<Darf14> *Inhales deeply*........yay
<mib_6033qz> Now that's a cheer.
<HaxBrony> lol
<duMORI> YAY!!!!
<Ivan2294> Rainbow Six is squad stuff. Battlezone you build your own base.
<Twentypercent> why is it called avast fluttershys ass
<nah> 0^
<SonicRainboom> favorite part is coming up
<Bunnylisk> ...did my cheering do that?
<AgnitioExMachina> Look up Chromehounds...and don't effing buy it
<mib_xosqn3> it's form the original song
<StarShine> 0The original song is Avast My Ass
<AgnitioExMachina> 90% of the game was online
<HaxBrony> lol
<StarShine> 0Or Your ass
<duMORI> your
<HaxBrony> loop
<AgnitioExMachina> And there's no more online
<wrek> ah hell, its 6 am. goodbye everypony
<StarShine> 0Can't remember
<nah> 0oh.
<BronyJack> My GF gets really "affectionate" while we watch ponies
<Twentypercent> o
<StarShine> 0Yeah
<ZSabotage1> by FIAB
<SherlockHooves> why is the original song called that?
<StarShine> 0Why not?
<ZSabotage1> cause he named it that
<duMORI> BronyJack lmao
<mib_xosqn3> BECAUSE RENARD SAID SO
<BronyJack> is that awesome? or weird?
<Nightmare_Moon> Sega killed the online servers after 3 years?
<StarShine> 0It's an awesome name
<Leoshi> Hey, I'm not complaining...
<Ivan2294> It's not quite RTS level-stuff, but it's more strategy than alot of the shooters out there.
<Nightmare_Moon> That's bad
<Leoshi> Not LOUDLY, anyway...
<duMORI> my ex bf just didnt get it XD
<AgnitioExMachina> Yep
<SherlockHooves> ah ok just so there's a reason lol
<Ivan2294> Chromehounds?
<RainbowSmash> @Bronyjack Clop Clop?
<ZSabotage1> ITS NAMED THAT AS PER RENARD V.
<AgnitioExMachina> Nightmare, you remember it?
<rubenflonne12> i don't get people why they say duke sucks....its ment of what it was ment, not a CoD peice of crap or a halo or some other generic FPS
<nah> 0song's better than i thought, but the title's a little offputting
<AgnitioExMachina> Yepc
<AgnitioExMachina> Chromehounds
<Ivan2294> Speaking of long-forgotten games.
<AgnitioExMachina> Nightmare, did you play it?
<HaxBrony> lol
<rubenflonne12> its ment to make you laught as you play
<Ivan2294> Anyone remember Conflict Seires?
<BigBob> Its parodying a song called "Avast your Ass"
<Dee_Twenty> I'm not going to support anything if they can't earn my money for what they've already put out. If they want me to pay $60 for a Duke Nukem game, they need to get to work on one that's WORTH $60.
<HaxBrony> play the double rainbow song
<CircuitMane> Quick Avast Fluttershy's Ass: The song was actually posted under Fur Affinity under a much bigger name, but since it was too long and set up to be the first song of an album they decided to shorten it to Avast your ass, and it went off to become a song meme from tehre
<Ivan2294> *Series
<RainbowSmash> I really want FPSs to ditch the whole regen health thing
<Nightmare_Moon> Never got to play it. It looked interesting enough but I had no budget for it at the time
<HaxBrony> yay
<duMORI> yeah but its not up to scratch with serious sam
<rubenflonne12> i agree
<BronyJack> I dig it
<AgnitioExMachina> It was a fun game to play lol
<duMORI> and that is dumb
<mib_xosqn3> hey, whoevers still talkign about duke nukem, go talk on pnychan =(
<AgnitioExMachina> It really was
<StarShine> 0Just like Witchcraft
<Nightmare_Moon> It looked fun D=
<Twentypercent> i don't what
<AgnitioExMachina> Not the best but it was def. fun
<Sol> Fluttershy has an ass?
<duMORI> ss is liek £6 quid HD remake
<duMORI> DNF £40
<StarShine> 0Spycraft is awesome.
<nah> 0who's renard?
<Ivan2294> Conflict: Desert Storm, Conflict: Vietnam, and Conflict: Global Storm. Anyone remember these?
<Nightmare_Moon> I blame Mechassault for liking mech based games.
<Sol> I didn't know she had a mule
<Broonsbane> google him
<StarShine> 0Furry music artist.
<AgnitioExMachina> Nightmare, I got an idea, we should start-up our own server
<BronyJack> Belmont!
<CrazyBrony> yay
<mib_xosqn3> nah: www.lapfoxtrax.com
<mib_xosqn3> thats his site
<nah> 0wait, uh, guy that made stylostyler?
<ZSabotage1> yeah
<mib_xosqn3> he makes good music
<HaxBrony> @sol she has that random pony from the last episode
<Nightmare_Moon> I'd need a pc copy and a machine capable of running it.
<Twentypercent> i like the part where it goes yay
<Broonsbane> JOHN FREEMAN
<nah> 0i've been wondering who made that, thanks
<HaxBrony> the blank flank
<Nightmare_Moon> =P
<ZSabotage1> this particular FIAB album is kinda old
<rubenflonne12> thing is, people who don't like it are people who did not grow up with duke nukem and grew up with FPS of today
<Sol> OF COURSE!
<HaxBrony> lol
<rubenflonne12> its quite funny
<Broonsbane> dude no
<DarkMemories> Toasters are notoriously bad at running games, I imagine
<DarkMemories> xP
<SonicRainboom> Damn, forgot how long this is
<Broonsbane> duke nukem is the FPS of today
<Leoshi> damn it, flash crashed on me.
<AgnitioExMachina> Yeah IK
<Broonsbane> it's got personality
<Broonsbane> true
<AgnitioExMachina> Anyways Nightmare, this game predated Mechassault
<AgnitioExMachina> http://www.abandonia.com/fr/games/471/Mechwarrior.html
<BronyJack> @rubenflonne I agree
<Dee_Twenty> I grew up with Duke, I loved Duke, but I don't love DNF.
<Sol> No, I played original Duke Nukems
<Leoshi> too much pony for chrome to handle!
<rubenflonne12> thats the point of duke
<Dashite> Duke Nukem 3D is the FPS of forever.
<Broonsbane> but its nothing special
<Nightmare_Moon> My laptop is a toaster, how'd you know?
<AgnitioExMachina> It's actually what helped inspire it
<Sol> I still hate DNF
<Darf14> *clopclopclop*
<HaxBrony> dam. i dont even know what channel MLP is on anymore
<rubenflonne12> duke is personality
<DaveKenroy> I think we need some Night of Pony
<Twentypercent> omg
<Twentypercent> yes
<Twentypercent> yes
<mib_xosqn3> DN3D is sooooooo fun
<SherlockHooves> awwwww
<DarkMemories> I smell the bread being cooked over the internet
<RainbowSmash> Rarity!
<Broonsbane> and for a game that took 12 years it needed to be special
<BronyJack> night of pony!
<DarkMemories> xD
<CircuitMane> @rubenflonne12 Hey, I grew up with Duke Nukem, and I'm annoyed at DNF. It's an okay game, but the price point is way, way off for what it is
<Nightmare_Moon> I know about the whole mechwarrior frnachise
<HaxBrony> anyone know what channel HUB is on with shaw cable?
<Darf14> I personally like Duke Nukem 3D
<SupaScootaloo> WOOT u go rarity
<nah> 0um
<CircuitMane> Yes!
<Broonsbane> screw cable, i have satelite!
<DarkMemories> Whoa, noon already?
<Stormy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7BSgWG6Kw&NR=1
<AgnitioExMachina> Well you can download it for free
<AgnitioExMachina> If you'd like
<Ivan2294> Any good abandoned strategy games? Preferably ones that are unique?
<Broonsbane> and it's 294 for me i think
<rubenflonne12> loved duke 3D all the way, as well i grew up with the old 2D games x3
<ahmhappehplz> smackdown shut your mouth and here comes the pain were and still are awesome
<Broonsbane> or 295
<Misery> i dont even have a tv
<Dee_Twenty> @CircuitMane: Exactly, $30 is the most I'd be willing to pay for it.
<AgnitioExMachina> Ivan, hold on
<RainbowSmash> Screw TV, YT it!
<BronyJack> Screw the hub, I have the internet!
<SupaScootaloo> even though rarity pals in comparison to pinkie pie
<DarkMemories> Wait wut
<AgnitioExMachina> Civilization I
<AgnitioExMachina> First of all
<rubenflonne12> and i was 6 when those games came out x3
<Ivan2294> Oh Civ 1 and Two
<Lambda> XD
<DarkMemories> It's midnight, not noon.
<Leoshi> Screw women, I have ponies...?
<AgnitioExMachina> Civ II isn't abandonware
<DarkMemories> Derp.
<AgnitioExMachina> actually
<Twentypercent> direcTV is 294
<Ivan2294> Well, I own Civ V so I wouldn't beable to enjoy it.
<mib_xosqn3> no.
<Outline> Define "Strategy".
<DarkMemories> I'm apparently quite tired.
<Nightmare_Moon> Took me forever to find out that mechassault isn't even considered canon =P the groups involved are practically nonexistent in the mechwarrior books with the exception of a little footnote mentioned in some book written back in 97 or something
<DarkMemories> xP
<SupaScootaloo> yeah
<Silverscreen> 11This is Rarity's official vid.
<BronyJack> Screw everything, I have ponies
<AgnitioExMachina> Ivan, you're probably right
<AgnitioExMachina> lol
<SupaScootaloo> YEAH
<Ivan2294> Too spoiled by my fancy animations
<CircuitMane> @Dee_Twenty actually I was thinking $40, but then I'd buy it used at that point so it would be $30 so yeah, kinda agree :)
<RainbowSmash> mm... Yes unless they like ponies too
<Darkened_Path> sounds about right
