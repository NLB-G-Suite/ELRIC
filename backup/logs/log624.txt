<cades> lol
<HoodyNinja> Holy crap sad animation is sad
<oni_link> Unnr: I was hoping to get back to the National Guard but if I get surgery, thats a no
<JESmith71> Dark92Enigma: Basically until the newsletter is fixed, the way they're doing lotto is during BMN intermission (This week on Saturday) they open a special lotto room. You go in that room and they pick four random people in the chat and those people pick the movies/pony eps

<HoodyNinja> Actually, I need a button that can play any song I want at any time and everyone around me can hear it
<oni_link> yikes thats a mess. I think you can just do what otakon said. Find the link in the steam game files and run it in compatibility mode.
<Barbetos> Niko Bellick will now be played by AJ
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: try setting the launch option to -noborder maybe that'll work
<Rex_Mundi> True men use windows 95
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Zamer i know it was from the South Park movie lol
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: tf2 has high requirements?
<Barbetos> Brucie will be played by Rainbow Dash.
<Spectrum_Rush> oh poo
<Barbetos> Packie will be Pinkie Pie.
<otakon> Sumica: you'll have to go into the main program files to set up compatibility mode
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: but its slow unless you have a fast computer
<Barbetos> Hrm... Fluttershy... Could be... Malory?
<Barbetos> Naaah
<oni_link> Dwane = Cranky Doodle?
<Zamer> so what is this week's movie night anyone know?
<Spademagnes[R]> Fall through the ground?
<Spademagnes[R]> What?
<Dken2021> Zamer I think A is Over the Hedge
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: ah thats bad, i was thinking of trying it some time, but skyrim lags for me even at 800x600 <.<
<Zamer> ooh nice
<otakon> Sumica: If you have a steam version of the game the compatibility tab will not appear by clicking on the game icon. Instead, highlight your Steam folder, right click on the file called Steam.exe, left click on properties, then on the compatibility tab and change. In addition, in your Steam folder, go to Steam Apps > common > name of game > name of game.exe, right click for properties, choose the compatibility tab and change
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: thats 800x600 + two optimization mods
<Dken2021> oh, well lottery winings are on the front page
<otakon> found on the forums
<Barbetos> Vlad is now Gilda
<oni_link> twilight_sprinkle: at least you can run it. I can only dream until I get my desktop so it sits there in my Library collecting dust
<superretroworld> twilight_sprinkle: is it the pc version?
<Petrified_Discord> Who needs ground?
<Unnr> Headless, wingless pinkestia is starting to creep me out
<RoboGerbil> since when do you need ground?
<otakon> Unnr: the hell did you find that?
<twilight_sprinkle> superretroworld: yeah, consoles dont have mods
<Unnr> otakon: I am working on a celestia to chrysalis custom
<Zamer> needs more Antartician women
<otakon> Unnr: oh
<otakon> but she's smaller than Tia
<Unnr> But in the process, its creepy
<RoboGerbil> Zamer: all the womens
<Petrified_Discord> Roman has all the womens. ALL of them. :|
<Unnr> Otakon, I am cutting down the legs, resculpting the joints to do that creepy extended thing
<Unnr> as a result she should be shorter
<Zamer> ^ but Rome fell for having too many women
<Barbetos> Dwayne should be rarity actually
<Unnr> also filing down the plot and re-sculpting it to be approps flatter
<Petrified_Discord> Zamer: *claps*
<Unnr> Though, otakon, if you look, Chrysalis isn´t that diffrently sized
<Unnr> http://i.imgur.com/lAvpE.jpg
<HoodyNinja> I LIKE VIDEO GAMES

<Champion_of_Harmony> right
<Unnr> taller, but skinnier
<Zamer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5KrGlnBVkE

<otakon> Sumica: you have to go into the games individual .exe file
<sub06905> oh god dat 50 shades of gray :|
<otakon> Sumica: If you have a steam version of the game the compatibility tab will not appear by clicking on the game icon. Instead, highlight your Steam folder, right click on the file called Steam.exe, left click on properties, then on the compatibility tab and change. In addition, in your Steam folder, go to Steam Apps > common > name of game > name of game.exe, right click for properties, choose the compatibility tab and change

<HoodyNinja> Dken2021: Wait wait wait, what fanfic?
<otakon> Sumica: here we go
<Buytoast> oh boy, san andreas
<Unnr> Barbetos: 50 shades of grey started life as a Twilight Fanfic
<cachi01|mobile> Dken2021 shades of gray is a fanfic?
<otakon> seems to be working so far
<Unnr> It was then re-edited, the names replaced, and released
<Dken2021> cachi01|mobile heard it started out as one
<superretroworld> HoodyNinja: shame on me
<otakon> O_o
<HoodyNinja> 50 shades of gray makes porn? I thought it was a book!
<Rain> LAWL
<Barbetos> Unnr Huh. Silly internet. Is it the same author atleast?
<otakon> so far so good
<HoodyNinja> Like, a real book
<Champion_of_Harmony> awsome
<AJIsAwesome> And yet it's a popular book?:S
<otakon> Sumica: that did it man
<OneTrickPony> lol wut
<Unnr> Same author of the fanfic
<Unnr> at least
<Reikim|Streamless> HoodyNinja: It's a book. Full of porn.
<Barbetos> Good
<otakon> Sumica: it's running way faster too, and your welcome :P
<Cades> sometimes my computer stops working and it takes awhile before it logs out on its own
<Zamer> wouldnt surprise me since immedietly near the end of the movies it came out and picked up by every women in the universe
<otakon> I gave useful info for once
<otakon> SOMEONE NOTARIZE THAT !
<Unnr> AJIsAwesome: It has sold over 40 million copies
<oni_link> Sumica: is good on this endo too, smooth frames, no flicker!!!!
<Maid_RainBow> op op op open ganama style
<HoodyNinja> Reikim|Streamless: I dont read and masturbate, too much work lol :D
<RoboGerbil> its got some rigid textures but it might be the stream
<oni_link> *end
*Reikim|Streamless notes that otakon was useful, for once.

<AJIsAwesome> superretroworld: Night!
<cachi01|mobile> Bye superret!
<twilight_sprinkle> diamond soup is best soup
<Maid_RainBow> he sounds like Pinkie pie liking Parties
<otakon> dem diamonds in the cake
<HoodyNinja> Reikim|Streamless: Oh I know it exists i just don't give a shit
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: actually it was a big vat of cake batter
<Zamer> literary porn which women will always deny it isn't
<Unnr> AJIsAwesome: That means more copies of the book have been sold, than there are people living in scandanavia
<otakon> I like Niko but I don't like this game
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: that makes more sense
<otakon> it's too damn boring
<oni_link> so 50 shades of grey started out as a fanfic... i dont even want to think of it...
<cachi01|mobile> Thats not dyin
<Dken2021> alright, let's try and make it big in this little country we call america
<Unnr> Well, at least denmark, sweden, finland and norway combined
<CECtheRonin> That's a relief to hear. My friend won't shut up about San Andreas.
<cachi01|mobile> Thats commiting suicide with style
<Champion_of_Harmony> I belive that niko is best protagonist of the GTA series.
<Reikim|Streamless> oni_link: You really, really don't. Seriously. Don't go anywhere near it.
<HoodyNinja> oni_link: VAMPIRE SEX!
<oni_link> Sumica: this game is my favorite of the series next to GTAIII :)
<otakon> oni_link: don't and think of something a bit purer...like Derpy delivering muffins
<sub06905> roman is best liar
<RoboGerbil> I liked GTA:SA best
<oni_link> Reikim|Streamless: i wont :(
<Barbetos> cabbages!
<Champion_of_Harmony> Well its all on personal preferances.
<oni_link> otakon: :0
<twilight_sprinkle> this reminds me of that serbian governor in america that got arrested for over 10 years for corruption
<Spectrum_Rush> Sumica: Tommy Vercetti
<otakon> dat music
<Shizuka> 13well so much for that plan
<Shizuka> 13promptly crashed quake 4
<Reikim|Streamless> What plan?
<Reikim|Streamless> Ah
<twilight_sprinkle> i forget whos the author of that song
<Shizuka> 13i guess procaster sucks at everything now
<Reikim|Streamless> So Procaster is being le stupid.
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: What did he do?
<twilight_sprinkle> she was pretty famous in russia
<sub06905> Drunk Roman is Drunk
<Shizuka> 13and i know fmle won't stay stable
<Champion_of_Harmony> But none the less, I love the GTA series
<CECtheRonin> Love this song. GTA always has the best soundtracks.
<Shizuka> 13guess i only get to stream super fuzzy tf2 or actually watchable video
<Buytoast> "He slammed his totem pole into my tipi of pleasure. I called upon the spirits of Pocahontos to guide my spirit back home after that out-of-body experience."
<otakon> me too Sumica
<otakon> Buytoast: no quoting that piece of fiflth
<Shizuka> 13and even then only for maybe an hour at a time before comcast starts chewing its fingers again
<twilight_sprinkle> AJIsAwesome: stole money, and there was a tape recording of him saying "this is a golden opportunity, im not going to let it go"
<Reikim|Streamless> No other options?
<Dken2021> Buytoast sounds like something from an erotica
<Buytoast> it's not a quote from it
<cachi01|mobile> Titties titties everywhere
<Unnr> Buytoast: O_O

<Reikim|Streamless> Notice how he grabs the Eva.
<Buytoast> they sounded like jar jar and shit
<Barbetos> It is hard to drive with keyboard
<Reikim|Streamless> Subtle Freudian hints. Perfect for Eva.
<Petrified_Discord> Epic traffic gameplay action
<oni_link> cachi01|mobile: I think I'll give my self a prrrrrrromotion :]

<MASF123> YourLittleDashie, the plushie that comes to mind is that Lyra plushie. o_0
<Kandarihu> Spectrum_Rush, Saturn isn't a gamer.

<Athgaar> why doesn't he have the knife from earlier
<Champion_of_Harmony> I saw a Bird......Kick its ass!
<MASF123> Be a man and fist fight him
<twilight_sprinkle> fighting is actually pretty hard in this game
<Kandarihu> I wonder if it's possible for you to just throw a driver out of his car, change his radio to something completely unlike what he had before, get out of the car and run away while the owner of the car reacts to his radio being messed up.
<otakon> guys it's about 1 30 here

<YourLittleDashie> It's not for sale anymore... :(
<YourLittleDashie> And That's not my pic I didnt make that
<twilight_sprinkle> YourLittleDashie: all i get is a pic saying "4chan" when i follow those links

<YourLittleDashie> Try this: http://derpy.me/IEhAF
<Rex_Mundi> Who ells was here for Wreks epic DOOM gaming session yesterday?:D
<MASF123> It's like I'm wearing, nothing at all, nothing at all.
<Kandarihu> Capitalism from a communist's POV
<Sylandest> really? :D
<Pinkies4thWall> hi MASF123
<Petrified_Discord> Kick him in the BAWLS!
<sub06905> dat kicking
<Athgaar> best part is you can knock him out like then

<Rex_Mundi> MASF123: Are you Spitfire?
<Athgaar> *like that
<twilight_sprinkle> sumica fights like a girl :D
<Athgaar> just nutshot him until he somehow gets a concussion or something
<Pinkies4thWall> Good timing
<MASF123> Lol. twilight_sprinkle
<Athgaar> ded
<Unnr> YourLittleDashie: Warning, incomming baww: http://imgur.com/a/W7WAQ#0
<MirrorImage> "You dropped something!"
<sub06905> ded
<MirrorImage> "Oh wait, nevermind!"
<Petrified_Discord> I'm surprised he survived that many kicks to the groin. Dude must have balls of cement.
<MASF123> Hi Pinkies4thWall
<Wrek> 05it took me 6 tries to kill this spider jsut now
<Wrek> 05dayum wasnt it durable
<YourLittleDashie> Unnr: D'aww... cute
<Petrified_Discord> Niko's such a rebel he takes dayquil at night.
<MASF123> How big was it?
<Unnr> Wrek: What did the little spider ever do to you?
<Kandarihu> 4chan has a policy against hotlinking from one website to theirs. I suppose it would make sense for the webchat to attach a referrer link to everything.
<sub06905> must have been one hell of a spider Wrek
<Rex_Mundi> O hi Wrek, God of gaming. master of DOOM.
<MakerDusk> Unnr: it apparently repeatedly dodged ;)
<Unnr> MakerDusk: :D
<Champion_of_Harmony> http://www.amazon.com/My-Little-Pony-Friendship-Rainbow/dp/B008JO54UU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1346132194&sr=8-2&keywords=Rainbow+dash+plushie
<twilight_sprinkle> spiders are hard to kill, theyre fast, crawl in the tiniest of holes, and are strong
<Unnr> YourLittleDashie: I always liked http://imgur.com/a/W7WAQ#5
*MakerDusk can be an evil pony :s
<Rex_Mundi> Hey Sumica, can you go on a Random killing spree, classic GTA free roam play?
<twilight_sprinkle> i probably kileld like a hundred spiders in my room
<Kandarihu> BTW, did Sumica ever finish that game published by the company that we all hate?
<twilight_sprinkle> EA i bet
<MakerDusk> Kandarihu: does Apple make their own games now?
<Unnr> MakerDusk: Evil is such a strong word
<MakerDusk> :p
<Rex_Mundi> yeah, nobody like EA, though the lord of the rings games were good
*Spectrum_Rush cough
<Kandarihu> twilight_sprinkle, yeah. Did he finish the game by EA that he's just recently picked up again?
<twilight_sprinkle> ohai MakerDusk, its been a while
<MakerDusk> heya twilight_sprinkle
<Athgaar> carbombs
<MakerDusk> and yes, I do still live
<Athgaar> the pinnacle of subtlety
<twilight_sprinkle> carbombs are fun, i like letting people steal my car and then blow em up
<twilight_sprinkle> Kandarihu: idk
<Champion_of_Harmony> LIAR!
<Champion_of_Harmony> Bullshit@!
<YourLittleDashie> This gets me everytime: http://derpy.me/1rYEr
<RoboGerbil> twilight_sprinkle: at least they have the courtesy to steal it first
<twilight_sprinkle> yay funfair

<Rex_Mundi> I want to scate this area like in a Tony hawk game.
<Petrified_Discord> Just park on the boardwalk. Like a boss.
<MirrorImage> dat vaguely immature bowling pin picture
<twilight_sprinkle> MASF123: although the killer was kinda anticlimactic imo, but other than that the eps were goodd
<YourLittleDashie> Bowl LIKE A BAWS
<Ponies47> And then my Internet frooze up >_<
<Athgaar> if that's what it's meant to be, the owner is immature
<Athgaar> or unfortunate

<twilight_sprinkle> and it stays that way
<Polydunami> I can feel it coming in the air tonight

<Flyboy> IS THAT THE TF2 SNIPER?
<Rain> Sumica, you need to get back in the hospital
<Rain> it has a coke machine that gives health :3
<Buytoast> RENAME YOURSELF JOHN Q
<Shizuka> 13taxi~
<Buytoast> and take control of all the medicine
<Buytoast> then you will truly be denzel washington
<Shizuka> 13so pc right, is the installation process still as awful as i've heard?
<Shizuka> 13where you have to make like six accounts
<Kandarihu> Well, Liberty City seems to be a pastiche of New York City, where guns are outlawed. Naturally, there IS a lot of gunviolence there.
<MirrorImage> naturally
<Buytoast> quick
<Buytoast> we need trollghost back in here
<Buytoast> surely he has a solution
<MirrorImage> it's a funny little thing that seems so obvious Kandarihu...
<Shizuka> 13san andreas is nice but i've pondered whether gta4's graphics and setting are worth the hassle
<MirrorImage> "Crime tends to go down when LESS things are crimes"
<Rain> why would they heal you after you shot them up?
<Shizuka> 13EY CUZZIN YOU WANNA GO WATCH BEEG AMERICAN PONIES
<Rain> yus
<Rain> I will be there in an hour, cousin.
<Ponies47> Ohai Shizuka
<Kandarihu> MirrorImage, we had a big debate earlier today over the 2nd amendment.
<Shizuka> 13it opened up massive
<MirrorImage> Kandarihu - you can have your bear arms, i just want the claws
<twilight_sprinkle> oh i remember that shitstorm...twas chaotic
<MirrorImage> those things are delicious!
<twilight_sprinkle> i remember it like it was yesterday
<Buytoast> is it time to talk about the rooty tooty point and shooty MURIKA shitstorm?
<Shizuka> 13nope it is time to talk about what we learned today
<Shizuka> 13and so what we have leaaarned applies to our lives today~
<Shizuka> 13and god has a lot to say in his book~
<MirrorImage> "I learned that teleporting choppers have right-of-way at all intersections"
<Buytoast> holy fuck that helicopter crushed that poor bastard
<Shizuka> 13nopony got my reference :<
<Buytoast> big comfy couch?
<MirrorImage> eenope
<Buytoast> bear in the big blue house?
<Buytoast> out of the box?
<Buytoast> throw me a bloody bone here
<WictimCZ> http://www.guildwars2countdown.com/ just few seconds
<Tovler> Allegra's Window
<Buytoast> sounds like a shitty spin off of charlotte's web
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, in other words, reference crude stereotypes of people who excercise basic rights?
<Kandarihu> Oh man, I was too distracted to pay attention to that which I personally asked for. Terribly sorry, Sumica.
<MirrorImage> Kandarihu - in all fairness, "owning a gun" isn't necessarily a "basic right"
<Buytoast> A-MUUUUURIKA, A-MUUUUUURIKA
<CECtheRonin> Night, everypony. I'm turning in.
<Buytoast> God claps his hands for theeeeeeee!\
<twilight_sprinkle> bye CECtheRonin
<Shizuka> 13sumica on his way to work
<MirrorImage> not in the same way as the more traditional "life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness"
<Alchemist> nooo, not a 2nd amendment argument
<Shizuka> 13nopony still got my reference .-.
<Shizuka> 13makes me sad
<Buytoast> And pop a cap, in every ass
<Wrek> 05the right to defend yourself? sure i can see the basic right in that.
<Buytoast> from sea to shining seeeeeeeaaaa!
<CECtheRonin> Bye, twilight_Sprinkle :)
<Wrek> 05right to a gun? nope
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Newbie Artist Training Grounds II: Day 27
<MirrorImage> Wrek ^
<MirrorImage> +1, end of conversation
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: the most i can thnk of is wheel of morality from animaniacs, sorry
<Shizuka> 13not even close...
<Kandarihu> Wrek, then with what? Blocking bullets with a sword?
<Spectrum_Rush> I tryed
<Buytoast> wait
<Wrek> 05im not sayign guns arent covered under
<Buytoast> i know
<Buytoast> the 700 Club
<Shizuka> 13how is it i am the only pony here who learned the basics of morality from talking vegetables on a kitchen counter :<
<Buytoast> i have'nt seen veggietales in years
<Spectrum_Rush> veggie tales Shizuka ?
<Wrek> 05im jsut saying that statign "aownign a gun is a right" seems way to narrowed.
<Wrek> 05and gives too much leway
<MirrorImage> Shizuka - because i'm from MURIKA and was too busy watching people drive around in circles for 400+ miles?
<Buytoast> last one i saw was that vhs with the fuckers from flibberoroo who wore pans and shit on their heads
<Shizuka> 13it was more of a kettle buytoast
<twilight_sprinkle> a gun doesnt really offer much protection, if a criminal plans to attack you, he'll do it in a way you wont see coming and youll be defensless anyway
<Buytoast> whatever it was
<Buytoast> they were on those high ass hills
<Buytoast> and throwing shit at each other
<Shizuka> 13the women and men, since 1710, wore on their heads one large shoe
<Wrek> 05stating "right to defend yourself" makes more sense since then its up to the person in question whether they want a gun t protect them or a back o bricks.
<Wrek> 05jsut a personall opinnion on the matter
<Buytoast> and then it had some space shit
<Buytoast> but
<Ponies47> All the color
<Buytoast> i do like the hairbush song bit
<Shizuka> 13the USS Applepies~
<MirrorImage> oh this wont end well...
<Buytoast> that was catchy as all hell
<Tovler> if you pre-emptively strike first, then you won't get shot.
<Shizuka> 13oh wheeeeeeere is my hairbrush
<Buytoast> OH WHEEEEEEEER IS MY HAIRBRUSH?
<Shizuka> 13larry, an early brony just looking to brushie brushie
*Rain becomes a hairbrush for Shizuka :3
<Shizuka> 13oh where oh where oh where oh where oh wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeere
<Shizuka> 13is mah hairbrush
<Wrek> 05hekc ints only in the past year we've been needingto review the gunlaws over here because frankly. its never been ap roblem
*Alchemist never experienced what brushing your hair is actually like
<Buytoast> all i remember is that the asshole who took the hairbrush sounded like that voice box talking guy from south park
<Wrek> 05ps: im typing liek shit due to sleep deprivation
<Buytoast> "Thanks for the hairbrush."
<Shizuka> 13the peach later became an IRS agent
<Buytoast> you stole it you assholwe
<Shizuka> 13and stole larry's last cookie at christmas
<Buytoast> that theiving little bastard
<Shizuka> 13basically the veggies were cool but the fruits were... fruits
<Shizuka> 13< a typical day in liberty city, enjoying a walk along the pier and some european comes jogging across the street with an RPG on his shoulder
<Shizuka> 13happens all the time
<Buytoast> shit now i could go for some asperagus
<Buytoast> sauted with almonds and butter
<twilight_sprinkle> dem blocked achievements
<MirrorImage> Chopper shooting at me? "Dude, let me finish my phone call!"
<Shizuka> 13this can't be our guy men he's just talking to his buddy on a cell phone

<Flyboy> its a hummer...
<Kandarihu> Dispatcher got confused. It's happened to me irl before when I was a kid
<Flyboy> oh nvm
<Kandarihu> Wait a minute, the dispatcher isn't a gameplay mechanic.
<Shizuka> 13you need to get a vehicle with any wheels
<DaringDerpy> get something heavier
<DaringDerpy> what game was this?
<DeadpoolDash> well that was fun to watch, time to play GW2 now

<Jmo> Lemme get some screenshots to show
<Kandarihu> How would this Semi stack up against an Armored Car?
<Shizuka> 13can you at least take out trees this time or are they still invincible
<Spectrum_Rush> it has better acceleration, but it cant stand up to thw same amount of punishmwent
<Kandarihu> Did I just hear a woman shout "ANOTHER DAY IN LIBERTY CITY!"?
<Flyboy> yup
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: even worse that before
<Flyboy> she's right you know
<Shizuka> 13hey i recognize that corner from a screenshot
<Alchemist> oh its gangstarr
<Shizuka> 13wonder if you can still get a combine harvester
<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: in the older games you'd atleast sometimes bounce of the trees, in this you'll be stuck to 'em like glue
<DaringDerpy> run forrest!
<Shizuka> 13niko doesn't even throw like a girl

<Spectrum_Rush> Shizuka: it skips on the ground actually
<Spectrum_Rush> they added that for some reason
<NocturnalBlade> internet derpped, did i miss anything?

<Sumica> 00,10now that is a mario movie I would want to see
<Kammerjunk> Is a stream even going?
<Sumica> 00,10yes Kammerjunk

<OtakuTom> I know this is a fan-made deal, but I have a gripe about DK kidnapping Peach...he's never actually done that in any of the Mario or DK games...it was always Paulina, the Mushroom Kingdom's top celebrity (an actress, if I remember the canon correctly)
<Flyboy> WHUWHUWHUUUUU?
<Kandarihu> This is all kinds of awesome
<Phase4> oh god, cmc space program

<Ponies47> Phase4: (Insert over used quote from Portal here)
<Phase4> Sumica, cmc + ksp = BEST SPACE
<OtakuTom> Can anyone else identify the game this song is actually from, 'cause it's not from Contra
<Phase4> i think its a custom mix of many songs
<OtakuTom> Nope, that song was from one game
<OtakuTom> It was from Batman for the NES
<Flyboy> should have had super mario underwater theme
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64: you streaming?

<MadSurge> Inb4 HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGHHHHH
<Sumica> 00,10that reminds me, i wonder if "a world with out rainbows" has updated at all
<MadSurge> What's that? a fanfic?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<Buytoast> is that one of those stupid alternate reality ones?
<Sumica> 00,10a duel universe thing where in one univers dash never did the rainboom
<Ponies47> Dang it you computer and your derps. I can't wait for my new computer anymore!
<Buytoast> well, at least it's not that stupid one about rainbow bitch joining the shadowbolts
<MadSurge> Oh boy, time for the worst episode yet :|
<Ponies47> MadSurge: woo
<Sumica> 00,10no instead dash was killed by NMM before the story evr realy started
<Sumica> 00,10Twi never became celestias student
<Flyboy> becuase i cant see that BLOWING UP IN YOUR FACE
<Buytoast> so an evil entity that wasn't even around at the time the protagonists were born somehow kills one of them in early childhood?
<Ponies47> （╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
<Sumica> 00,10no Buytoast, dash trys to fight back with a bunch of otheres from the flight school
<Sumica> 00,10but because twi was never celestias student she was't in time to stop NMM from taking over
<Ponies47> Chat is pretty darn quiet
<Klumzeedragon> Well that was weird. I was confused as to why the video I was watching sounded echo...y. I had started a video with the MLP opening theme AS SOON as this episode started.
<MadSurge> :D
<Buytoast> ah

<Sumica> 00,10eventaly you end up with all of them on the moon side trying to put a stop to NMM
<Sumica> 00,10but yeah it's a bit dark.
<Klumzeedragon> Sounds interesting... I have only read three fanfics.
<MadSurge> Not really interested in fanfics, no matter how nice they sound...
<Sumica> 00,10normaly I dont go for dark but this is well done so I can live with it
<Buytoast> i stopped reading fanfics long ago
<Sumica> 00,10Noting wrong with that MadSurge

<Klumzeedragon> x
<Klumzeedragon> xD*
<Vordox> I'm really curious about where you are going with your art style, Wrek.
<Vordox> Any certain points you're trying to affix to?
<Pearly> Pearly likes to draw.. mostly anime and other things..
<Klumzeedragon> I like to draw whatever I can. As long as it motivates me.
<Klumzeedragon> xD
<Gold_Demona> I like to draw, but I haven't been very inspired lately. :<
<Gold_Demona> I've mostly been drawing my Nuzlocke comic, but artwise, it's more than a little half-assed.
<Pearly> same here
<Pearly> well what Klumzeedragon said
<Pearly> it's my job, basically.. It would be interesting if I tell the whole world, that I am a briny.. in my area.. after I put a pony on my flyers... oh well Pearly doesn't care
<Klumzeedragon> Yeah, the last thing I drew was an OC Pony. :D I need to finish it though.
<Wrek> 05ok this gona take ages
<Pearly> haha wow, I wonder if it will get a rise out of people... on fiverr "draw you as a pony"
<Klumzeedragon> You're doing good though Wrek. :3
<Pearly> Wrek, ages, really?? I hope it doesn't I want to be able to hg wrek and pearly would miss wrek..

<MASF123> Wrek you don't know where to put the sniper at?
<Klumzeedragon> Got some Amon Amarth in that epic library of yours?
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://imgur.com/o9OnM,m7FRp,HPLuJ
<Malavolent> Ello there everypony.
<Jmo> 'ello Malavolent
<Gold_Demona> Hiyo Malevolent
<Pearly> hey there Malavolent
<Klumzeedragon> Hows it going Malevolent?
<Malavolent> I'm quite well.
<Malavolent> Got new glasses today.
<Klumzeedragon> Awesome! Are they super fancy?
<Gold_Demona> I love getting new glasses. The world looks brand new every time. =)
<DemoPegono> Eeyup.
<Malavolent> It's like switching back to 1080p.
<DemoPegono> Every time I take my glasses off I see stuff getting blurry the farther it is.
<Gold_Demona> Same here. It's called being near-sighted
<Gold_Demona> Without my glasses, I can't see anything unless it's like two inches away from my face.
<Malavolent> Plus, glasses look cool.
<DemoPegono> Yeah. I try to read things far rarely, but mainly I just use them (Why not?)
<Gold_Demona> Nowadays they're cool. When I was a kid, glasses were the bane of my popularity. =/
<Malavolent> True.
<DemoPegono> Lol
<Gold_Demona> Not that I was ever a popular kid to begin with, but that really didn't help
<DemoPegono> Where I live when I was young, people called my four eyes. * cracks necks * Never actually liked be calling that.
<Malavolent> And today you can see people wearing glasses even if they don't have any sight problems.
<DemoPegono> But now I don't care what people say
<Gold_Demona> I try not to care, but I just have too many feels in my system. >=\
<Klumzeedragon> :P Strange how people work huh?
<Gold_Demona> I know right?
<Jmo> D'awwww Gold_Demona.
<Malavolent> Not really.
<Malavolent> Most of people are predictable.
*Pearly hugs Gold_Demona
*Gold_Demona hugs Pearly back.
<Gold_Demona> It pisses me off sometimes how easily hurt I am by words. It's stupid.
<Klumzeedragon> Most. But I mean how we as a society change through the years.
*Jmo glomps Gold_Demona
<Klumzeedragon> Not individuals/
<DemoPegono> D'awww. (Why am I d'awing?)
<Pearly> I been called 4 eyes too
<DemoPegono> Brb.
*Gold_Demona is glomped by Jmo. XD
<Gold_Demona> Ohai Jmo
<Jmo> Hai Gold_Demona :>
<Pearly> but as I got older, I didn't care much
<Klumzeedragon> DemoPegono: Because of the feeeeeeeeeels.
<DemoPegono> ... tis be true.
<Gold_Demona> Yep
<Gold_Demona> Them feels, man. Them feels.
<MASF123> Gold_Demona, I'm easily hurt by words too.
<MASF123> "Words don't hurt anybody" people say, but they don't get so insulted on an oridinary basis.
<Gold_Demona> Exactly, MASF123
<MASF123> Some less, some more than others
<AdamTheDuck> Sticks and stones :P
<Jmo> Trout and tuna.
*Jmo slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
<AdamTheDuck> I usually tend to ignore insults
<Pearly> well, lets just say that I had a hard life but I didn't care much anymore on what anypony says
<Malavolent> Social outcasts unite?
<AdamTheDuck> I find it easy for some reason
<MASF123> Sticks and stones will help me forget of the insults once I end my life. Lol.
<Gold_Demona> AdamTheDuck: I try to, but it's not that easy for me. =\
<DemoPegono> Ugh! Where are my sneakers?!
<MASF123> That's what the rhyme should end with. :D
<AdamTheDuck> No MASF123 ! FIGHT THE POWAH
<Klumzeedragon> Under your bed!
<MASF123> AdamTheDuck, she can't take mych more captain!
<Gold_Demona> MASF123: Whaaaaaa?! D:
<MASF123> much
<MASF123> Gold_Demona, you heard me dammit.
<DemoPegono> Never mind. Found them in my bookbag.
<AdamTheDuck> Yay, took the name of Marshmallow Rarity in Guild Wars :3
<Gold_Demona> Ah'm gehven' 'er ohl sheh's goht!
<Jmo> Oh Gold_Demona >.>
<Gold_Demona> lol
<DemoPegono> For some reason I'm calm in the chatroom in the morning, but hyper at night.
<Gold_Demona> DemoPegono: Night person? I know I am. Only reason I'm on dayshift schedule is because my husband is.
<Gold_Demona> But I function better at night
<Wrek> 05not too shabby
<Gold_Demona> Lookin' good, Wrek. =D
<Klumzeedragon> Looks damn good!
<DemoPegono> Huh. I'm 13. Guess it was when I was born.
<Klumzeedragon> If you have a smokey barrel, may need a shell casing?
<Wrek> 05the longword sniper doesnt work like that
<Klumzeedragon> Oooo. I see. Disregard that statement then.
<Klumzeedragon> xD

<Klumzeedragon> Great music choices too/
<Wrek> 05Klumzeedragon: you should drop by when i do a proper session
<Wrek> 05i barely did anythign this one x3
<Gold_Demona> DemoPegono: Well, you're in for either the best years of your life or the worst. Either way, you'll probably come out of it a better person.
<Klumzeedragon> Ha ha. I plan on dropping by a lot more for sure.
<DemoPegono> Yeah. I want to be a philosypher. * this guy tginks a lot *
<DemoPegono> *thinks
<Gold_Demona> That's really cool. I love philosophy. =)
<Jmo> Philosopher you mean.
<DemoPegono> Okay
<DemoPegono> Philosopher. Noted.
<Gold_Demona> Very interesting stuff, that.
<Klumzeedragon> He said Philosypher. Let him be a Philosypher.
<Jmo> >.>
<Klumzeedragon> :D
<DemoPegono> Philosophy has so much religion in it, but one man can follow only one of those religions.
<Gold_Demona> lol, that looks like it'd be pronounced "fill-oh-SYE-fer"
<DemoPegono> I follow Christianity. Praise the Lord, amen.
*AdamTheDuck is still unsure of his faith :P
<MASF123> Praise Lord Smooze! ^_^
<Gold_Demona> Nothing can stop the Smooze!
<DemoPegono> Who is Smooze?
<MASF123> The whole world will be consumed by his Ooze! ^_^
<Klumzeedragon> I was confirmed Lutheran, do not know what I believe anymore.
<Gold_Demona> Here DemoPegono. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CnOysetlQw
<MASF123> Lord Smooze is a God a worship that will bring the apocalpse to the world.
<Klumzeedragon> Maybe I'll follow the church of Unitology!
<DemoPegono> Uhh... okay. Odd. Just sticking with Christianity.
<Klumzeedragon> :P
<Pearly> Praise Pearly, so thenshe can make you feel happy with streamers :D
<MASF123> Cult Leader Fluttershy says that if we put mud on or faces in a spa we will please Lord Smooze. :)
<DemoPegono> What the hay?
<DemoPegono> gtg
<Gold_Demona> If it pleases Lord Smooze, then it must be done. =D

<AdamTheDuck> I couldn't stop laughing :D
<Gold_Demona> lol
<MASF123> I used to believe in Celesia as my God, but now it's all Smooze.
<MASF123> Celestia
<Tovler> I used to follow Arceus as my god.
<MASF123> And before Celestia was Sweet Tooth and before that was Super Mario and before that wad God.
<MASF123> was
<Klumzeedragon> I pray to the Marker. But maybe Smooze will consume my thoughts.
<Gold_Demona> I used to be religious like you... But then I took a Smooze ball to the knee. >_>
<Jmo> ._.
<MASF123> Maybe praying to Smooze will get the stream back up.
*MASF123 kneels for Lord Smooze
<Gold_Demona> Praise Smooze!~ D:
*MASF123 whispers...for Smooze.
<Klumzeedragon> It was supposed to be SuperBrony64 up next, but he seems to be hitting some "Zzz's". Which isnt very nice if you ask me, he shouldnt hit them.

<TheRandomkid321> If I could have ANY food ever... I would have a Jaffa Cake... I could have chosen ANY food ever and I chose a Jaffa Cake...
<EspyLacopa> Does it come with a free goauld symbiote?
<AdamTheDuck> I would have one of those "The Lot" burgers, replace the buns with hash browns and add a whole layer of salt inbetween.
<MadSurge> Chocolate cookies :3
<EspyLacopa> At least it isn't a deep fried krispy kreme donut.
<AdamTheDuck> Oh and deep fried afterward :P
<TheRandomkid321> I once had a deep fried mars mar... *frool*
<TheRandomkid321> *drool
<AdamTheDuck> Then pour gravy over the damn greasey thing
<AdamTheDuck> and more gravy... and more gravy...
<AdamTheDuck> THEN DEEP FRIED AGAIN
<EspyLacopa> Can you do that?
<EspyLacopa> Fry something twice?
<MadSurge> We need more MMMM like episode where Pinkie describes more food porn :Q

<MadSurge> Hello Vivix!
<Vivix> Hiya MadSurge and AdamTheDuck
<Vivix> sup in here?
<MadSurge> NOTHING
<Vivix> No streamers or anything?
<AdamTheDuck> Nope :/
<MadSurge> Everyone's doing their thing
<MASF123> nope mods are gone
<Vivix> Aww
<RoboGerbil> taco party
<MadSurge> Wrek just stopped finishing his Sniper Twi
<Vivix> He still sick?
<MadSurge> Vivix: he's trying to get some sleep now
<Vivix> ah, yeah- good for him
<Vivix> being sick sucks
<MadSurge> Aye
<MadSurge> I only get galactic colds that last 3-4 days but leave my nose devastated :D
<MASF123> My name is John Martson.
<MASF123> I'm here to kill Bill Williamson
<MadSurge> Wut
<MASF123> I rode in a gang...we robbed people. I left the ganag after the gand left me...
<MASF123> People don't forget...nothing is forgiven.
<MadSurge> I don't know which movie/game you're quoting... :(
<MASF123> RED DEAD REDEMPTION
<MadSurge> Ah
<Gold_Demona> My first thought was Clockwork Orange, but that works too. =P
<MadSurge> I don't play many games like that
<MadSurge> What do you think of Infamous? :D
<MASF123> If I don't capture my brother in arms...great harm will befall my family.
<RoboGerbil> has anone played dishonored>
<MASF123> DUTCH ALWAYS SAID YOU WERE AN ARROGANT SON OF A BITCH MARTSON!!! :[
<AdamTheDuck> Dishonored isn't out yet, isn't it?
<MASF123> Marston...this is a land of opportunity....
<MASF123> Native American: Maybe you live in a different America than we.
<Metronome> 10.09.2012<--- Dishonored release date
<MASF123> Sheriff Jonson: It's gonna be one hell of a bloody job.
<MASF123> I don't know any other kind.
<RoboGerbil> hmm wonder why steam isnt doing a 10% discount or buy 3 get 1 free ?
<MASF123> Yes you...are the Bounty Hunter yes?
<MASF123> OMG...hold up I'll be back.
<Vivix> They said red dead would come on the computer, I haven't seen it yet
<Vivix> I played it on PS3 and adored it though
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Vivix> stop eeeet
<Jmo> Never L3
<Jmo> :3
<Vivix> whaat ?
*RoboGerbil ships Jmo and Vivix
<Jmo> That'd be something.
*Vivix is in a shipping crate, shipping all over
<Vivix> hehe
<DeadpoolDash> oh crap and the shipping begins
<Vivix> Ship everyone with everything!
<RoboGerbil> anyone into my little pony: roleplaying is magic?
<Vivix> What is that? A game or just general rp?
<RoboGerbil> http://www.mlprim.com/s2e/
<killerpony7733> God my day is just meh
<Metronome> Chat is quiet........ Random Earrape video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20K0AWm2Vug
<Vivix> Ohh, Pen and paper?
<AdamTheDuck> Metronome, OH JESUS WHY
<killerpony7733> Metronome Ear rape videos are not allowed, Even when there is no stream
<killerpony7733> It counts as a screamer
<Jmo> Oh
<Jmo> Roleplaying is magic
<Metronome> OK:S
<Gold_Demona> Ooh, tabletop. I've always wanted to try that!
<Vivix> Brb, restart chrome. Skype installed its click to call thing despite me saying NO
<killerpony7733> Metronome Just warning ya bud
<Gold_Demona> I have nobody to play with tho. =/
<Metronome> ok i get it D:<
<RoboGerbil> Gold_Demona: you have us
<Gold_Demona> RoboGerbil: You can do tabletop over the internet? O_o
<Vivix> You can
<RoboGerbil> of course
<Vivix> DnD has a RP client that's really cool
<Vivix> RPTools
<killerpony7733> Metronome I'm gonna boop your nose
*Gold_Demona is a tabletop newb and has no idea how any of it works, but wants to try it anyway
*Jmo slaps Vivix around a bit with a large trout
<Vivix> you can probably play tabletop ponies with RPTools
<Jmo> YARR ME HEARTIES
<Vivix> yarr! We be poirits!
<Gold_Demona> Yarrrr!
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: same
<RoboGerbil> f tools, just use your imagination like a real rper
<Vivix> I used to play tabletop DnD with my cousin, really fun
<Vivix> Well the tools are just a chat thing
<MadSurge> Gold_Demona: sounds really fun
<Gold_Demona> It seems like a really fun social activity. I'm not big on social things, but I think I can really get into tabletop RP
<Vivix> where the gamemaster can keep all the stats and information, and change his name and whisper easily
<RoboGerbil> id use skype so we can talk rather than type
<Vivix> Talking gamemaster is best gamemaster
<Vivix> gamemaster maakes the game though, if he's boring and says things like "oh you rolled a nine, you missed." instead of going..crazy and describing how you missed
<Vivix> yaeh-
<MadSurge> Vivix: overly verbose is never boring in a game :D
<Jmo> It'd be an interesting thing to do.
<Vivix> hehehe, true. and it's more fun to hear a description than being tolled "you missed." 15 times
<Vivix> told*
<Jmo> I'd probably be back-stabbing Vivix everytime I get the chance.
<Jmo> :>
<Vivix> ;__; bastard
<Jmo> I LOVE YOU TOO.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<Vivix> what's fun with PNP is that you can do anything you want, gamemaster just has to interpret it into the rules
<RoboGerbil> but in pony rp, combat is rare anyway
<MadSurge> PNP?
<Vivix> yeah-
<Vivix> pen and paper
<MadSurge> Oh
<Vivix> like- that's what I always loved, you could do anything. Like grab some guys chemistry set and throw it all in a bucket to see what happens. The GM just has to--do his thang and make it cool
<RoboGerbil> and if i ran it, id ad lib most of it. let the players describe the setting
<Vivix> yeah, it's a very fun and social game
<Jmo> yeah, fun, heh.
<MASF123> http://derpy.me/zofvO This is what I was talking about.
*Jmo back-stabs Vivix
<Jmo> ADVENTUUUUUUUUUURE~
<Vivix> it's best if everyon stays in character and stuff-
<Vivix> Damn, you fiend!
<Jmo> Suck it up and roll for a healing spell.
<MadSurge> Vivix: also keep some flexibility to the players' choices and punish jackasses who are actively griefing :D
<Vivix> yeah
<MASF123> Anyone? http://derpy.me/zofvO
<Vivix> red dead trailer, aw yeah
<Vivix> our gm would constantly roll dice, like all the time, so that we never knew when he did it to check things
<Jmo> This is just reminding me of the DnD Community episode.
<Vivix> /notseen
<Jmo> Dear lord >_>
<Lil_B> hi everyone :)
<Jmo> Hai Lil_B
<Vivix> hiya Lil_B

<Jmo> I forgot Gold_Demona was still here.
<Lil_B> we have no stream?
<AdamTheDuck> Nope :/
<Gold_Demona> lol, Yeah I don't say much when I have no input. :P
<Metronome> STREAM IS DEADdddddd
<RoboGerbil> stream is red dead
<Metronome> ^
<Lil_B> Gold_Demona same here XD, I'm here all the time but I don't say anything for hours XD
<Vivix> Idlepower <3
<RoboGerbil> so how many would be willing to try a pnp pony game?
<killerpony7733> Lil_B I come and go with what i say, But i constantly keep my little eye out
<Jmo> I would, if Vivix was coming along.
<Gold_Demona> RoboGerbil: Me too
<Vivix> Maybe, depending on the wheres and hows
<Vivix> I'd - being the nervewreck I am - prefer text, but yeah
<Vivix> damn box!
<RoboGerbil> wheres and hows is skype
<Jmo> Vivix, suck it up.
<Vivix> ;__;
<Jmo> I'd be like a minion sitting on Vivixs shoulder.
<Vivix> You could be a tiny little 'Spike' or Gummy
<Jmo> Something like that.
<Vivix> Gummy would be best, you could bite all you want
<RoboGerbil> you can be a pony or dragon
<Jmo> No alligators? That's racist.
<Jmo> ;~;
<Vivix> hehe
<RoboGerbil> can have a pet
<Vivix> Well, you wouldn't be able to talk
<Jmo> I do what I want fewl >.>
<Jmo> Don't make me get out the trout again
*Vivix quivers like a beaten dog
<Gold_Demona> oh noes! Not the trout! D:
<RoboGerbil> read the player guide already
<Jmo> I'm only two pages in and already chuckling.
<RoboGerbil> i like how they did magic in this system

<Jmo> nemnemnem
<Vivix> chat is super calm since mods are sleeping
*Jmo nomths Vivix
*Vivix bites Jmo's tongue
<Jmo> ;~;
<Kammerjunk> I love it when chat is calm.
<Vivix> It's kinda nice, yeah
<Gold_Demona> Me too
<Gold_Demona> Nothing's on fire
<MASF123> mods are like the enforcers here...without rules life is boring
*Jmo sets Vivix on fire
<Kammerjunk> We didn't start the fire.
<Jmo> I BEG TO DIFFER.
<Vivix> I usually zone out when it starts filling up by night
<Vivix> !
<Kammerjunk> Ditto.
*Lil_B puts on some Aquatic Ambience from Donkey Kong Country to make to match teh calm chat
*Kammerjunk puts on Strobe.
*Vivix puts on som yo la tengo the sounds of sounds of science ambience jam
*Jmo puts on Vivix
*Vivix is a fantastic record

<AdamTheDuck> Noooo, this is good :3
<Kammerjunk> Mods are alseep.

<Vivix> On FimFiction me and Halycon Android have put out like- 50 links, and 2 pages of discussion, mostly ambient rock and synth stuff, and alternative etc
<Vivix> in the music forum
<MadSurge> Like A Boss, Lil_B :D
<MadSurge> Mods are asleep, post humans!
<Lil_B> MadSurge Like a goddamn Boss XD
<Kammerjunk> I like synth. And alternative. And ambient. And classic. Everything, basically.
<Vivix> I like most things, but my heart is alternative I think
<AdamTheDuck> This one gives a strong feeling for some reason, I like it :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUs-35E2dW0
*Vivix listens
<Vivix> Sounds kinda like Mogwai and Mono child in the intro
<Vivix> Voocals!
<AdamTheDuck> But very soft vocals
<Vivix> I loove them
<AdamTheDuck> Ikr :3
<Vivix> I adore soft and shaky vocals
*Jmo slaps AdamTheDuck around a bit with a large trout
*Vivix favs and decides to hunt in recordshop
*AdamTheDuck has been slap so many times by large trouts
<Vivix> Codeine and Low also fall into this category, but--different setting and instrumentation, heard them?
<BronyInstrumental> hello everypony
<BronyInstrumental> quiet today?
<Vivix> Hiya BronyInstrumental
<Vivix> yeah
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai there BronyInstrumental
*Vivix hugs AdamTheDuck as thanks for link
<AdamTheDuck> Always a pleasure. :)
<Lil_B> hi BronyInstrumental
<BronyInstrumental> i haven't played tekkit in a while
<Gold_Demona> ohai BronyInstrumental
<Vivix> http://youtu.be/J_r0N_ZPhDE Saw this band a few weeks ago? or something, fell in love with this song, a bit long though
<Vivix> Live it was just a punch in the heart
<BronyInstrumental> let's do some random games. look to your left, the first thing you see is your cutie mark. what is your talent?
<Vivix> Sheetmusic, writing compositions
<Gold_Demona> Emptying bowls that had previously contained cereal
<BronyInstrumental> Guitar, playing guitar
<AdamTheDuck> BronyInstrumental: Damn, a buffer bar is my cutie mark :D
<Gold_Demona> Empty cereal bowl
<BronyInstrumental> AdamTheDuck: your special talent is now buffering, congratulations
<AdamTheDuck> *Yay*
<Vivix> I'm actually surrounded by instruments atm
<Lil_B> my scool bag is my cutie mark... or my chair
<Gold_Demona> If you want DIRECTLY to my left, it's my crochet box
<BronyInstrumental> i'm surrounded by all sorts of performing arts crap, like easels and canvases and musical instruments, etc
<Gold_Demona> I could live with that. A crochet cutie mark
<Vivix> are you a gearhead?
<BronyInstrumental> gearhead?
<Vivix> like- love instruments and amplifiers and pedals- just in itself?
<BronyInstrumental> i don't think i catch your drift......
<Vivix> like- collect guitar amps or something
<BronyInstrumental> no, i don't collect them
<Vivix> I want to- but money
<BronyInstrumental> i just have 1 of everything i need, as of yet
<Vivix> I've got.. 4 amps I think
<BronyInstrumental> although it's gonna cost me a lot for my bass
<BronyInstrumental> and i've only got 1 amp that's not powerful enough for a bass, so i'll need a bigger one
<Vivix> Ahh, what you looking at there?
<Vivix> yeah
<Vivix> I've got a 1970s peavey 400 (they go for like 150 bucks, but are amazing) and a Hartke5500 for bass
<HiImSpike> hey everybrony

<Vivix> I kinda want something with that pickup, after hearing Blur
<TheMonstaMuffin> Hi everyone who came simultaneously on with me
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: damn you and your legal employment >.>
<Vivix> hehehe
<Vivix> Years of saving money and being poor
<AdamTheDuck> Hello TheMonstaMuffin
<Lil_B> Vivix can you hold all your Basses or do you drop them regulary... and how awfuly was my pun?
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: years of being too young to get my ass a job....anywhere
<TheMonstaMuffin> And Hi BronyInstrumental, AdamTheDuck and Lil_B
<Vivix> That pun, aah. Yeah I broke my bass neck once, and crushed a few jacks
<Vivix> Aah yeah-
<Vivix> I got my first bass when I was..14, Fender precision from my cousin, used and beaten up. And then I didn't get anymore until I was 19 or 20
<BronyInstrumental> i've been getting money by dogsitting. not hard work, but it's slow cash. good enough for me, at any rate
<TheMonstaMuffin> I came on because a fellow brony added me on steam and said he was on Bronystate ;)
<BronyInstrumental> TheMonstaMuffin: oh rly? who was it?
<Vivix> income is good, even if it is low
<killerpony7733> TheMonstaMuffin Ah so you are new to BS?
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: i got my first guitar for my 14th birthday, which was July this year
<TheMonstaMuffin> Killerpony7733 No! no no no i've been here A LOT
<Vivix> Ah nice, what guitar is it?
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: SG, special edition :3
<killerpony7733> TheMonstaMuffin Welp forgive me, I just don't always remember names
<Vivix> Ah nice
<Vivix> I want an SG too-
<TheMonstaMuffin> Bronyinstrumental I dont know what his BS name is >.<
<RoboGerbil> http://derpy.me/PPYvc
<BronyInstrumental> my dad has one of the few remaining les pauls, me want! >.<
<Vivix> I want a really cheap Les Paul, take off the neck and put on a jazzmaster neck and vintage mics
<TheMonstaMuffin> killerpony7733 No worries! I can't even remember any one from my fammily's birthday
<Vivix> Ah hehe, yeah. They're nice things
<killerpony7733> BronyInstrumental Going to turn 18 by during next month and my parents are going to give me a pretty ok amount of money along with childhood savings they have been building up
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: he has one of the ORIGINALS, it was second hand when he got it (30 years ago) so it's pretty sick
<Vivix> Niice, yeah
<TheMonstaMuffin> BronyInstrumental It seems he is HiImSpike
<Vivix> The odlest instrument I have is a 1960s Norwegian steel string accoustic- 100 bucks ish, but really neat sound
<killerpony7733> I remember that guy
<BronyInstrumental> killerpony7733: well happy birthday in advance :)
<BronyInstrumental> my sister has a strat. how boring is she? everyone has a strat :3
<killerpony7733> BronyInstrumental thanks i guess, But yeah i will have so much money i don't know what to do with. Probably gonna save most of it and maybe take a trip to somewhere
<Vivix> hehe
<TheMonstaMuffin> killerpony7733 The same as BronyInstrumental said! xD
<Vivix> I want a beaten strat, for that midneck sound, but I-- they're so booring to look at
<Vivix> I save most of my money since I don't drink or smoke or anything, so even with my low income I suddenly have much money
<killerpony7733> TheMonstaMuffin Yep thanks, Gonna be something to turn 18
<HiImSpike> killerpony7733: how r you
<TheMonstaMuffin> Vivix No drinking! :O
<TheMonstaMuffin> Vivix aww
<BronyInstrumental> i don't drink, smoke, drive, buy food, i pretty much have all my cash to myself
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back!
<HiImSpike> BronyInstrumental: Yeah I know the feeling
<TheMonstaMuffin> BronyInstrumental You are the perfect human! Im not ideal on that part :)
<fluttermac> hey sp!!!:)
<Vivix> I got- of guitars: SX Telecaster with Seymour mics, Ibanez SAS(wut), Hofner Galaxie repro, Behringer smashed to pieces Sonic Youth guitar, unnamed guitar for weird tunings and drumstick use, and I think that's it
<killerpony7733> HiImSpike Not my best day, Slept for 7 hours or so woke up with litterally no energy and wen't to school for two lessons asked if i could go home. And then i took a 1 and amybe a half hour nap at home.
<killerpony7733> maybe*
*AdamTheDuck hugs killerpony7733
*killerpony7733 hugs back AdamTheDuck
<fluttermac> what we wathching
<AdamTheDuck> Hugs always make people feel better :3
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: i wish i knew what those were, sorry, i have little knowledge of the guitar world, i just know what feels familiar, I.E. the guitar's i've been learning with
<AdamTheDuck> fluttermac: No stream at the moment sadly
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck Ehh depends, I have not gotten a real serious hug for years
<TheMonstaMuffin> Anyone saw Alexxm, CCCP or Ninjazz today?
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: and believe me, i tried a LOT of guitars, and SGs just sound right for me
<Vivix> yeah, telecaster is pretty standard, but I love it. I am a guitar lover- I really want jazzmaster, jaguar, mustang- Fender VI would be a dream come true, but yeah- all a bit obscure
<Vivix> hehe, yeah
<AdamTheDuck> killerpony7733: I give out free hugs to people at school, everyone thinks I'm insane :D
<Dark92Enigma> Any fellow latinamerican/hispanic bronies around here?
<fluttermac> nope
<killerpony7733> AdamTheDuck Heh that's you i guess then. But yeah not the case for me :P
<RoboGerbil> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AHHOTDzWuM&feature=related
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: like, i tried out a dot, a strat, a lousille (BB King), les paul, and the SG just sounded the best for me
<fluttermac> derp face for canadins
<Dark92Enigma> Oh.
<Vivix> Yeah, it is very individual. I want a SG for fuzzed out noise, but I prefer twangy vintage sounds, so I lean to the european and fender brands
<fluttermac> lolololololollololololololol
*Vivix finds dreamguitar
<fluttermac> :[
<BronyInstrumental> if only my SG were vintage, it's special edition, but it's epiphone, not gibson :<
<Vivix> http://cdn1.gbase.com/usercontent/gear/3057451/p1_uhz0bnjpy_so.jpg this is one of my dreamguitars
<BronyInstrumental> my dad has a vintage strat, a fender one, not squire, and he won't let me use it cause he thinks i'll break it :D
<Vivix> Aah, Epiphone is pretty good for their price though
<Vivix> Aaw
<Vivix> I love vintage guitars and amps, I was saving up for a 1978 Gibson RD Bass, but it sold the day I decided I had enough money-
<Vivix> The other seller refused to ship outside of USA
<fluttermac> byy
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: :<
<Vivix> I also like Teisco and unbranded japanese 60's instruments- crazy cheap and wonky sound
<BronyInstrumental> my dad doesn't want me to buy a bass, cause he thinks bass is for people that can't play 6 string ones. but too f*cking bad for him
<Vivix> http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4463327534_60b6735e98_o.jpg I mean look at this, Musima Eterna, DDR Guitar from the 60s-70s
<Vivix> Aah, that's mean
<BronyInstrumental> pretty slick, Vivix
<Vivix> Bass is my love, like my main instrument, but guitar is a fun and great way to express aswell
<Tovler> mfw SpilldotCom discussed Bronies and I wasn't privy on it,
<BronyInstrumental> i'm fully proficient in bass, and semi-proficient in guitar (can't do lead, only rhythm)
<Vivix> You could buy a Fender VI, or Gibson EB-6, six stringed basses from the 60s, with 30" necks and thin profile
<Vivix> I'm proficient, but I can't say I'm fully proficient in bass
<Vivix> Like- billy sheehan or- that Chick Corea or what'shisname guy
<BronyInstrumental> well, i say "fully proficient", i mean i can play just about anything that's put in front of me, with a little time and practise
<Vivix> yeah
<TheMonstaMuffin> Im off guys ;)
<TheMonstaMuffin> cya
<Vivix> I'm pretty good at reading fast, but I tend to jam along on first try, great exercise in playing with others is to play songs you don't know
<AdamTheDuck> Bye TheMonstaMuffin
<TheMonstaMuffin> Bye :)
<Vivix> Byye
<Saturn> 08,01http://evil-dec0y.deviantart.com/art/Trixie-Vs-Discord-323655112
<BronyInstrumental> Vivix: yeah, i'm actually taking a class in school this year like that. playing songs and learning songs you've never heard before, with other people
<Vivix> Yeah, it's a lot of fun. My eh "major" (english, waat) in Community College was improvisation for stage
<Vivix> the guitarist next to me sometimes played with chains and hammer on his guitar
<BronyInstrumental> heurgh, more people that have finished college when i haven't even started it yet. i feel young -_-"
<Gold_Demona> I feel old. I haven't done any school in over six years
<Vivix> Hehe, it was a one year college, no--degree, you only had to send in demo of your music and be over 18
<Vivix> admission there was automatically approved for audition for LIPA though- but I didn't try
<AdamTheDuck> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2vPgIhYp20 , 'cause there's no stream :3

*BronyInstrumental welcomes Malavolent
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Malavolent
<Vivix> The only lessons I've had was during that college year
<Vivix> Great teacher, focused mainly on holding beat and improvising-
<BronyInstrumental> the lessons i took were during what my school calls "opportunities days", basically; do random bullshit for 5 hours, for 3 days
<JRP|ghost> my dam internet
<Vivix> I would love drumlessons, or something, I've only played that for lulz, but oh god it is fun
<BronyInstrumental> and one of those happened to be a cello lesson
<Vivix> aah
<Vivix> AdamTheDuck, chill, and sweet voice

<RaveBrony> Lol! :D
<Meanwhile> Ew, banana.
<Vivix> I used to watch Lyoko now and again, right after school, it wasn't bad, but I never caught enouh episodes in a row to get the story
<MASF123|> Sumica it says on Wiki they re-used many animations for talking and run cycles because they had a tight budget. Later they got more money and got better animation. So I can see why Season 1 may have been lacking in the beginning.
<spitfirecolt2> me too i thought code lyoko was good
<MASF123|> Code Lyoko is great who said it was bad?
<somepony_else> hi everypony
<Ponies47> O never really got into Code Lyoko :/

<RaveBrony> Woof!
<magmablock> Wishbone!
<Buytoast> but you'd be able to tell the textures
<Dragonmatte> Are you rea- WOOF!
<Buytoast> especially if the apple's skin is still on
<MirrorImage> yeah, but if you remove the apple skin, then you have a wet apple inside, but the potato is still dry
<MirrorImage> it negates the test
<Pearly> what is this about a skin?
<Shizuka> 13hm
<Vivix> I've eaten a lot of raw potatoes
<Meanwhile> Und now he's Saturn.
<Shizuka> 13oh i see the audio derp is VAC

<Buytoast> oh fuck get godzilla
<Dragonmatte> All dem sound effects :S
<Gold_Demona> I'm not sure what potatoes you handle, but anytime I cut potatoes, they're juicy like apples
<MirrorImage> Gold_Demona - well, not *as* juicy
<Dragonmatte> A fish, fly, or Bill!
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> Maybe the apples are by Applejack.
<Vivix> I'd say they're roughly the same juiceyness
<Gold_Demona> Juicy enough that you'd have to be pretty damn observant with your sense of touch to tell the difference
<Meanwhile> Sharks are cool.
<GreeHetBronyInDuitsl> I like apples
*Jmo pokes Vivix
<Jmo> raw potato.

<LadyCanary> Ponies47: FRESHMAAAAAAAN. But seriously, the first day is always the most nerve racking. I think you'll do just fine.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ponies47 bring new clothes along
<Everlasting_Joy> Ponies47: Forget the impossibility of getting to sleep, just think of the impossibility of waking up to your alarm clock.
<GLaDOS> I find the first day of school the best day of school.
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: Pfffft. Buck that. It's gonna suck. I know it will.
<LadyCanary> Ponies47: It will only suck if you believe it to be that way.
<Ponies47> LadyCanary: Well it's just the freshman nobody else. Just freshman
<LadyCanary> Go in with stride.
<PinkiePry> This is amazing. ._.
<Ponies47> Everlasting_Joy: Ugh
<killerpony7733> Buck yeah
<Ponies47> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Why? O.O
<Flootahshy> HAY GUYS
<AJIsAwesome> Flootahshy: Hello!
<LadyCanary> XD Dat face.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Ponies47 i thought it would be like in my school, but if its only freshmans you'll be safe
<Everlasting_Joy> Dramatic prarie dog.
<LadyCanary> ....YESSSSSSSS.
<Flootahshy> What'sa goin on here?
<mitamaking> Gits?
<Ponies47> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: Ah. Ok. :P
<Spectrum_Rush> the first day for freshmans is nothing... now the first friday for freshmans well... just make sure you're not walking home...
<AJIsAwesome> Flootahshy: Ghost in the Shell.
<GLaDOS> My school sucks.
<LadyCanary> I've been trying to sing this FOR AGES. ;3;
<Everlasting_Joy> LadyCanary: How's it coming along?
<LadyCanary> But it's really hard.
<mitamaking> Spectrum_Rush: Freashmen can't walk home, they stagger home on Fridays
<GLaDOS> Everyone in my school is an imbecile.
<shibaru> Poofing, huh? That's always fun.
<LadyCanary> It proves to be very hard. Many pitch chages, and it's difficult for me to hit such high notes.
<mitamaking> I go to a community college, I am afraid I am smarter than some of my teachers
<LadyCanary> Wait....are we actually watching an episode?
<LadyCanary> :O
<Vivix> wat really?
<Ponies47> Oh yeah becasue it will be my first day and high school and I will have no friends what so ever. NO PONY STUFF OR TALKING ABOUT PONIES ALLOW. I can handle that *Eye twitchs* O_O
*Pearly hugs LadyCanary
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Pony stuff isn't allowed?
<Everlasting_Joy> Ponies47: So? You have us, and you'll only be in school for a few hours.
<GLaDOS> Ponies47: Is your school in Korea?
<LadyCanary> Well, that's how you start as a freshman, Ponies47. No friends, until you talk to someone. And when you're comfortable to bring up ponies, then do so.
*Jmo nomths Vivix
<Sumica> 00,10celing tachikoma is watching you smooze
<GilDash> So, this is the famour Ghost in the Shell... I think I'll hang around.
*Vivix sucks Jmo's face
<Ponies47> AJIsAwesome: Well I got no friends and such so me being a brony cannot be told until I have friends and such :/
<Jmo> Well that's something.
<Ponies47> Everlasting_Joy: True :P
<DaringDerpy> GilDash: the movie is better
<GLaDOS> Personally I find making friends in school to be a waste of time. Friends are annoying.
<Ponies47> GLaDOS: Nope it's in America!
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: I would follow LadyCanary's advice.
<Gold_Demona> Well, Imma head out for today. See ya tomorrow, Bronystate.
<GilDash> DaringDerpy: I've honestly no idea. In terms of anime, I've literally no knowledge whatsoever.
<Jmo> Baai Gold_Demona
<AJIsAwesome> Gold_Demona: Bye!
<Panda> Sumica Tachi? wait...
<Everlasting_Joy> Take care Gold_Demona!
<LadyCanary> Hey, Sumica, do you like Big O?
<Vivix> that lipanimation
<Shizuka> 13see i'm not sure where this guy fits in
<Vivix> "ba ba ba, ba bababa, ba"
<Sumica> 00,10yeah LadyCanary
<DaringDerpy> GilDash: you can trust me on this :)
<LadyCanary> Ever consider streaming it one day? If not, thats alright.
<Vivix> Ponies47, Ihad no friends when I entered college thing, what saved me was that I have a sticker on my bass that one of the guys recognized and was liek "HEY DUDE! I LOVE THAT BAND"
<Vivix> foot in the doooor
<Sumica> 00,10would need to find eps first
<GilDash> DaringDerpy: Okay, I will. Until then though, I'll just have to do with what's on stream. :)
<Shizuka> 13name and rank
<Jmo> Vivix, what were you referring to with the baba?
<Shizuka> 13just look at her shoulders genius
<LadyCanary> Gotcha.
<Shizuka> 13will tell you both
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Comic: Core of the Apple / CMC Pokemon / Makes Me Wonder
<Ponies47> LadyCanary: Good advice. That my take a while but at the end of the year I'm going to wear a TON of pony stuff to school. :P
<Vivix> Jmo, the mouth animation on the stream
<Ponies47> *may
<Lil_B> I went with my RD T-Shirt to school, appearently they were weirded out that they saw a Pixeled-Pony with a Rainbow, but they didn't question it further
<Jmo> Oh right Vivix.
<Ponies47> Vivix: I see
<SirGanjalf> wat
<Vivix> A small hint is enough to make--people reach out, you know? I would have never reached ou to him, but he did to me
<LadyCanary> For now, go easy on the pony stuff, Ponies47. Dont wear too much stuff. Be subtle, not too much to give yourself attention. ESPECIALLY as a freshman.
<Vivix> and when I knew him, via him I got to know other people, and was able to go to the cantene without--hiding under tables and shit
<Everlasting_Joy> LadyCanary: You beat me to the punch :).
<Shizuka> 13hi folks!
<LadyCanary> Pawnch.
<shibaru> You like to poof, don't you?
<Kandarihu> Oh man, this episode.
<Ponies47> LadyCanary: I'm not goign to wear any pony stuff at all! Not even my wristband for it says Brony and RD right on the thing.
<Everlasting_Joy> *Robotnik.
<Ponies47> And has RD on it*
<MadSurge> PINGAS
<GLaDOS> I don't want to be a robot in the future.
<MadSurge> ^
<Vivix> that ugy has no eyes
<Ponies47> Fun Fact: I watched every episode of that Sonic Cartoon and I liked it O_O
<Spectrum_Rush> Ponies47: which one
<SirGanjalf> Yeah, being a robot in present gives you more advantages
<GLaDOS> What one? SatAM or Adventures?
<Cades> whats that?
<Vivix> echo
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush: The Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog :$
<GLaDOS> ..echo.. echooo
<AJIsAwesome> Ponies47: Same here.
<shibaru> POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF
<Everlasting_Joy> Media vultures.
<Shizuka> 13nice shot
<SirGanjalf> MY LEG!
<LadyCanary> Like I said, Ponies47, just be subtle. The biggest mistake most freshmen make is making a big scene to seem ERRMAHGURD SO KEWL. Just be yourself, and stay cool. As for the ponies, as I said, just dont say anything until you're comfy.
<Lil_B> I like the NC Review of this Sonic Cartoon, one of his earliest and one of my favourite
<GLaDOS> Who was that guy? Was he a hobo?
<SirGanjalf> MY OTHER LEG!
<AJIsAwesome> A lot of people hate that cartoon just because it isn't SATam, but that's because it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be cartoonish and over-the-top, which is why I likt it.
<Cades> ?
<Everlasting_Joy> SirGanjalf: My leg!
<Ponies47> LadyCanary: I'll take that advice very well. I don't like it when a huge croud of people are looking at me. It scares me :S
<GLaDOS> That guy from Spongebob: My leg!!
<AJIsAwesome> I like both SATam and AOSTH equally.
<Everlasting_Joy> GLaDOS: :).
<Ponies47> I think Spectrum_Rush is speechless now
<Ponies47> Or he's writing a book
<Vivix> "Someone got shot! Get the cameras!"
<shibaru> JG,HF KJHFMJGF JHFJMHFK J
<shibaru> I dunno
<GLaDOS> Spectrum is fancy. He's writing a novel.
<Lil_B> Ponies47 is should go well if you follow LadyCanary advice, I didn't mention to my classmates that I watch that show for over a year now, exept close friends and them I told to not spread it
<LadyCanary> Very close to real life, Vivix. XD
<Spectrum_Rush> why am i speechless? Ponies47
<Vivix> yeap
<Cades> lol
<SirGanjalf> Steam powered robot?
<SirGanjalf> woah
<Vivix> what..the voice
<Ponies47> Lil_B: Okie doki loki!
<GLaDOS> How quaint.
<Ponies47> Spectrum_Rush: That funfact before.
<Lil_B> Ponies47 and try not not eccedently quote the show XD
<Kandarihu> SirGanjalf, steam-ejecting arm. Maybe it's neumatic.
<GLaDOS> No. It's just magic smoke.
<Vivix> wat
<SirGanjalf> dat smile
<Ponies47> Lil_B: That's impossible for me. I seem to do that. ALOT :$
<SirGanjalf> Yeah, so why are you not laughinh?
<GLaDOS> I sense use of drugs.
<SirGanjalf> *laughing
<Lil_B> Ponies47 well... I think "eeyup" is tolerable, but don't give someone a brofist saying "Brohoof" XD
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<GLaDOS> Okay everpony! We don't need to hoof out advice!
<GLaDOS> :3
<Everlasting_Joy> Hey Bronysith!
<AJIsAwesome> Bronysith: Hello!
<Lil_B> oh god Bronysith D:
<Ponies47> Lil_B: Oh God. I know that's gonna happen some day. Somebody holds ther fist and I saw "BROHOOF! Um.. I mean BROFIST" and then he gives me WTF look :$
<Ponies47> Hey Bronysith
<Lil_B> Ponies47 XD
<Vivix> Spin a long tale about how you were born with hooves, claiming that's why
<Vivix> never admit that it's a lie!
<GLaDOS> lol
*Pearly hugs BronyInstrumental
<GLaDOS> If you continue to make pony puns. Say you're mentally disabled.
<Sumica> 00,10just tell them you just dont know what went wrong
<Lil_B> "I have been woeking on a Ranch latly and thats how we greet the horses... >_> "
<Ponies47> Lil_B: I just know that's goign to happen someday. I just know it!
<GilDash> Is it good or bad that I'm following what's going on despite only having watched half of the last episode and this one and never seen this show before?
<Vivix> animation budget just saved 1200 dollars on dialogue
<Ponies47> *going
<BronyInstrumental> why thank you Pearly, but why?
<SirGanjalf> "My grand-grandfather was a centaur."
<Vivix> ^
<Pearly> I am just a nice pony, andhugs are good
<GLaDOS> "I have an obsession with My Little Pony."
<Vivix> Hehe, tell it as it iz
<Pearly> *giggles*
<GLaDOS> Walk off like a boss.
<shibaru> Can I lick your heart? I promise to put it back when I'm done o_o
<Vivix> grab him by the shoulders, look him straight in the eyes and say "I fucking love ponies"
<Sumica> 00,10may the Farce be with you
<Cades> sure
<GLaDOS> lol
*Lil_B bitches more about his bad connection "what's the Purpose of the Internet if I can't have Video ! D: !!"
<GilDash> Vivix: Don't forget to mention "I watch it for the plot."
<Shizuka> 13and then the major was fourth wall aware
<Vivix> hehe, yes!
<SirGanjalf> GilDash: plots*
<SirGanjalf> :P
<GilDash> SirGanjalf: True, there's a lot of plots there.
<Sumica> 00,10her ghost is actaly pinkie, Shizuka
<Shizuka> 13figures
<SirGanjalf> dat view
<Lil_B> I recently watched at a work manual for an analysis... one of the machines was called "Plotter"
*Vivix snickers
<Lil_B> read* not watched
<Shizuka> 13velveteen is a good track too
<Vivix> I'm not sure where 'plot' came from, I can't find it in horse anatomy things, but I guess horse have a lot of slang aswell
<Lil_B> once I see it I must make the "Dat Plot" Face ... even though nobody will get it
<Vivix> hehe, they'll think you really like machinery
<foxinator> ohay everypony
<Sumica> 00,10most the tracks of this are realy good
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy foxinator!
<GLaDOS> Imagine The Doctor didn't actually take his companions through time and space. He actually drugged them and raped em whilst they were trippin'. That would make an awesome DW fic.

<Vivix|Woops> Fantasia was an animation experiment based on german folk tales and modern animation techniques. Like bambi and the other great 5 they were all made around 1940
<Spectrum_Rush> 777777
<Canadian_Brony> -_^
<MadSurge> Pilgrims!
<Vivix|Woops> Fantasia was supposed to be a running series of experiments, but it never happened. Also, the tales were childrens tales, if I remember correctly, and most old chidlrenstales are HORRIFYING
<Sumica> 00,10was lucky and got to see this in theaders when they re-released it back in the late 80's
<Canadian_Brony> I wasn't even alive then

<Kandarihu> Yes, the conductor said it would end with Ave Maria
<Applejack2012> AJ and Flutter approves
<ekips> what movie is this?
<Kencolt> AJIsAwesome: No... in the original she intended to eat them... but they freaking baked her. Almost casually.
<AJIsAwesome> And in Cinderella, the sisters cut off ther toes so that they could fit their feet into the glass shoe.
<Petrified_Discord> ekips: Fantasia

<LadyCanary> ?
<Kandarihu> Back when the founder was running things
<Dken2021> ah, never saw fantasia, only saw the part with chernabog and wizard mickey
<StinkomanFan> I got a question
<Tovler> oh, I just missed the fairies in fantasia.
<MadSurge> Saturn: yeah, that's what I thought
<LadyCanary> Never played Dark Souls Sketch_Toku_Brony XD
<Vivix|Woops> and before the great animation strike that ruined Walt's relationship with his animators
<Canadian_Brony> Tovler eeyup
<Cades> eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwww bloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
<Kencolt> Tovler: And the ponies. There were ponies.

<Canadian_Brony> Tovler and they were adorable!
<Saturn> 08,01sounds so... tight
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> LadyCanary oh :$
<Canadian_Brony> Why doesn't anything get animated like this anymore?
<Kencolt> Unbelieveably adorable.
<Tovler> That flower's pistil is bigger than mine.
<Vivix|Woops> money- it's crazy expensive
<Canadian_Brony> ah
<Vivix|Woops> At least MLP is animated part this and part rig
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: avatar?
<Tovler> naughty botany humor
<AJIsAwesome> StinkomanFan: He knew that the game wouldn't be released on Virtual Console.:D
<Kencolt> disney had to invent an entire new kind of camera to pull this stuff off.
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> crap like Suite Life thats why lol
<Vivix|Woops> Look at-- eh.. Tom and Jerry, 1960s animation for TV, and see how far we've progresed with money and talent
<MadSurge> FISHES
<Bronysith> http://cheezburger.com/6546483968
<Dken2021> as great as traditional anamation is, it's also hella expensive, and a longer process
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol its a Goldeen
<LadyCanary> :D Blubblubs
<Tovler> oh hawt silouette
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn . . . -_(\ how did I not remember that? I watched the entire series and researched a bit of it, including the animation.
<Sumica> 00,10well before little mermade
<Canadian_Brony> Brain!
<CrazyCherry> Ollataas
<Canadian_Brony> Y U forget?
<CrazyCherry> OUIABFOIUSfoias
<Vivix|Woops> Very very much longer, yeah- the inbetweening and colouring- I have no idea how many cells was in this movie, but -- one simpsons episode was..3500 cells? and that's cheap and 22 minutes
<MadSurge> Cleo! :D
*CrazyCherry join dashiesauce
<Vivix|Woops> were*
<CrazyCherry> h+ohe0rhjperjghp¨wejg
<Dken2021> elo CrazyCherry, and seems you put in a wrong command
<Saturn> 08,01also, Fantasia doesn't have felt.
<Tovler> I think I hear an oboe
<Saturn> 08,01or Pinkie Pie, for that matter
<MadSurge> Saturn: :D
<Canadian_Brony> darn
<Dovah> what is this?
<Saturn> 08,01Tovler: it's actually a cor anglais, i think
<Canadian_Brony> I like Pinkie Pie
<Canadian_Brony> Dovah Fantasia
<Saturn> 08,01hey guys, why's a cor anglais called a cor anglais?
<Canadian_Brony> dunno
<Saturn> 08,01because when anglais saw it, he went "cor!"
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Vocal Music: Colgate's Brew / Shooting Star / Subtle Loveliness of Night
<Lil_B> Rando Movie Trivia: Fantasia didn't made money for Disney on it's first release in 1940, but it made much money when it god re-released in the 60's as a "Trip Movie"
<Vivix|Woops> cause its an angelic choir?
<Vivix|Woops> yeah, Bambi also flopped the premiere
<MadSurge> Saturn: they forgot the "blimey" then :D
<Vivix|Woops> which is INSANE to think about
<Tovler> Dah, english horn would have been my second guess.
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix|Woops: actually, cor is short for cornet, which means trumpet or horn
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn that is the 2nd lamest pun I've heard today. Somehow, the most lamest was actually funny.
<Saturn> 08,01and anglais is english
<SirGanjalf> Lil_B: I can understand why:D
<Vivix|Woops> Ooh, yes-
<Saturn> 08,01so it's literally the english horn
<MadSurge> RUSSIAN DANCER FLOWERS
<Dken2021> I take it most of the songs are from tchaikovskys
*Sketch_Toku_Brony remembers fighting Dream Eaters w/ this in the BG
<Saturn> 08,01which reminds me of a Flanders and Swann joke
<Kencolt> Saturn: So... a british unicorn?
<Canadian_Brony> seems legit
<SirGanjalf> Dken2021: I think this part of the movie is entirely a Tchaikovsky homage.
<Canadian_Brony> wouldn't doubt it
<Spectrum_Rush> a know i've never avctually seen russians dance like that
<howdyx> Yeah we in Russia have dancing flowers
<Quick_Thinker> HELOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BRONYSTATE
<Tovler> The only double reed instruments I know are: oboe, english horn, and bassoon.
<MadSurge> hey Quick_Thinker!
<Dken2021> lali-ho Quick_Thinker
<howdyx> <Quick_Thinker> hi
<Canadian_Brony> hi Quick_Thinker. Welcome to Fantasia
<LadyCanary> Fairiesss :3
<AJIsAwesome> Quick_Thinker: Hello!
<SirGanjalf> Green fairies? Absinthe included.
<Quick_Thinker> i wondered what we were watching
<Cades> im an artistist
<Canadian_Brony> Fantasia
<Quick_Thinker> I LOVE FANTASIA :D
<Saturn> 08,01"to this end, I have been practicing the French Horn, as they call it, or the German Horn, as the French call it; not to be confused, of course, with the Cor Anglais"
<Lil_B> wow... I can see parts of the stream without reloading constantly... wut is this magic?
<Dken2021> did night on bald mountain play yet?
<Saturn> 08,01cracks me up every time!
<Spectrum_Rush> aah Autumn... my favorite season
<Canadian_Brony> I can play a recorder . . .
<Canadian_Brony> sort of
<Canadian_Brony> and a ukelele
<Canadian_Brony> sort of
<Saturn> 08,01i play the cello
<Tovler> Is this the uncensored Fantasia with the questionable centaur part?
<Kandarihu> I guess to answer the question to why stuff like this doesn't get animated anymore, everything has to convey a narrative. Even Youtube Poops have stories to them.
<Saturn> 08,01Tovler: i think you just missed that
<Tovler> Nah, the centaur skit hasn't played yet.
<Vivix|Woops> Animation is- beautiful
<Saturn> 08,01DUUUUUH DUUUUUH DUUUUUUUUH DIDDLY DUM DUM
<Canadian_Brony> Gah! Why does everybody I know have more talent for musical instruments then me? My friend can play the Sax for crying out loud!
<Vivix|Woops> and luckily now in 2012 we are able to animate similar to this on the cheap- but I don't think any cel animators are still alive
<LadyCanary> How saxy.
<LadyCanary> XD
<Saturn> 08,01epic cello moment
<Sumica> 00,10and this is all from befire they had any kind of computeres
<Vivix|Woops> most animation is still handdrawn
<MadSurge> Tovler: you missed the unicorns/pegasi part
<AJIsAwesome> CUE OCTAVIA SOLO
<Vivix|Woops> Remember, up until S14 Simpsons was drawn with the exact same techniques as this movie
<Quick_Thinker> also i have a new ish idea for a fanfic
<MadSurge> Sumica: beautiful isn't it?
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: well, to be fair, i have more musical talent than most people...
<Sumica> 00,10even the editing was all done by hand
<Quick_Thinker> im nost making it until i can get some opinions though
<Dken2021> Canadian_Brony no worries brah, it's been years since I touched a percussion instrument, and I probably suck at them now
<Tovler> So, Fantasia isn't being played straight through?
<Sumica> 00,10no Tovler
<Sumica> 00,10just clips that I can find
<MadSurge> Autumn!
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn how is your singing voice?
<Tovler> so some Fantasia 2000 stuff might play?
<LadyCanary> Nope, winter <3
<MadSurge> And Winter!
<Vivix|Woops> I have huge amount of respect for the colour ladies and men, and the inbetweeners-
<LadyCanary> Hnnnnnng so gorgeous
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: i'm a classically trained bass
<Quick_Thinker> i wonder if you could do a PMV of this if you pulled it off right
<Dken2021> Quick_Thinker ........ doubt it
<MadSurge> LadyCanary: let's be thankful for this masterpiece :)
<Tovler> I'm just happy that I can recognize instrument sounds.
<Vivix|Woops> It would just not be as cool as the original
<Kencolt> Oh, snap... Lauren Faust and Walt Disney working together. Terrifying and glorious.
<Tovler> I guess the Fantasia thing with the dinosaurs is too long
<MadSurge> Quick_Thinker: request accepted!
<Sumica> 00,10this the one Saturn?
<Saturn> 08,01rite of spring! rite of spring! rite of spring!
<Quick_Thinker> ?
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: yup!
<Quick_Thinker> oh the steam thing :)
<MadSurge> Yep
<Saturn> 08,01okay, so i need to tell you all the story about The Rite of Spring
<Tovler> Is that a Bassoon?
<Quick_Thinker> yay another friend to add to the list
<Saturn> 08,01Tovler: it is!
<Saturn> 08,01Tovler: playing at the very top of its register
<Sumica> 00,10sorry found a better one
<Saturn> 08,01so the Rite of Spring is the piece of music that's playing behind this
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn I'm a treble. Not as good as I used to be, and a significantly lower range, but I can still put on a show.
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: aye, i thought the pitch was off
<Wrek> 05http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/240/e/6/comm___haze_s_dark_decent_by_ruaniamh-d5cqv76.png
<Quick_Thinker> and i have a new idea that may or may not work for fic. Anypony here play ARMA 2 (not Day Z ARMA 2)
<Canadian_Brony> ohai Wrek
<LadyCanary> Wow, 1940 :O
<Tovler> now it definitely sounds like a Bassoon
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: it starts on a C, but that other video sounded like it started on a C#
<Lil_B> Vivaldi's Winter?
<Sumica> 00,10this is also the full bit
<Sumica> 00,1022min long
<Sumica> 00,10other was only 7
<Tovler> I can't tell most clarinets apart.
<SirGanjalf> galaxy
<Tovler> english horn?
<MadSurge> Oh god, is this the dinosaur one?
<Quick_Thinker> i think octavia is timing it prett well :)
<Dken2021> ooh now I remeber this piece
*CrazyCherry yawns.
<Dken2021> just wait
*Quick_Thinker falls alseep
<Quick_Thinker> zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
<Sumica> 00,10yes MadSurge
<CrazyCherry> My yawn is super effective!
<Tovler> This is already better than Tree of Life.
<MadSurge> Sumica: this is much scarier than Chernabog
<Quick_Thinker> damnit jiggly puff *snore*
<Tovler> whoa, big time skip
<Science_Brony> *yells in Quick_Thinker 's ear* SCIENCE!!!1!!!1!!
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, so Stravinsky is the composer of this. He was a Russian composer in the early 20th Century
<Spectrum_Rush> oh i love the dinosaur one
<Saturn> 08,01i regard him as really the remnants of the impressionist
<Quick_Thinker> HISTORY
<Tovler> The burning galaxy part was skipped for me
<Saturn> 08,01but feel free to disagree with me
<Canadian_Brony> Quick_Thinker awake now?
<Quick_Thinker> yep
<Canadian_Brony> good
<Quick_Thinker> wait nope nvm :l
<Quick_Thinker> ok im muting it
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, as you can here, this piece is quite striking in its dissonance
<Quick_Thinker> or at least 50% it
<Saturn> 08,01this was somethign that audiences of the time were really not used to
<MadSurge> Saturn: can we agree he was an awesome musician? :)
<Klumzeedragon> While the nice music plays, I'll go make food, so I has noms to enjoy while watching.
<Vivix|Woops> Dissonance <3
<XylemTube> what's this?
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: of course!
<Quick_Thinker> fantasia
<AJIsAwesome> XylemTube: Fantasia
<Saturn> 08,01in fact, this is possibly my favourite piece of orchestral music of all time
<Canadian_Brony> hi XylemTube. Fantasia. "Rite of Spring" IIRC
<Canadian_Brony> or somethin' like that
<Sumica> 00,10I like this part
<Kencolt> Clips from Fantasia, at the least.
<Spectrum_Rush> clips from fantasia to be exact, not the whole thing
<Saturn> 08,01so The Rite of Spring was oriignally conceived as a ballet
<Canadian_Brony> this was a ballet?
<Saturn> 08,01it tells basically the story of Beltane, but as told in the Russian folk mythos
<Vivix|Woops> I'm not very familiar with classical music, but I kinda like stravisnky, and what I heard described about him, how he wanted a sharp mechanical sound at times-
<Canadian_Brony> volcanoes?
<Canadian_Brony> in a ballet?
<Quick_Thinker> dude now im starting to remember all the music and cool scene i saw in this movie as a kid
<Canadian_Brony> I need to get out more
<Quick_Thinker> so bad bass
<Saturn> 08,01it's the beginning of spring, and there are elders who are performing this Rite
<MadSurge> Saturn: I know a game you would like, it's a puzzle game called Catherine with a lot of classical music as bgm :D
<Saturn> 08,01and it culminates in a virgin dancing herself to death as a sacrifice
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos
<Sumica> 00,10this must have been a bitch to get the tieming set
<Canadian_Brony> ^
<MadSurge> ^^
<Tovler> so much Bassoon in this piece.
<XAX> Morning all.
<Canadian_Brony> hi XAX
<Quick_Thinker> and there went earth
<MadSurge> Hey XAX!
<Kencolt> This is rather like 2001, but animated in this clip.
<Dken2021> evening XAXy
<Quick_Thinker> hi XAX
<Saturn> 08,01so this was a ballet, and it was choreographed by Vaslav Nijinkski
<Kandarihu> Skipping spring. Going straight to geological summer
<Saturn> 08,01who was also quite a revolutionary artistic figure of the time, in the field of dance
<AJIsAwesome> XAX: Hello!
<Tovler> And then the earth died.
<Saturn> 08,01the choreography he made for the piece was equally striking, especially to audiences of that time
<MadSurge> Dat primordial earth
<Spectrum_Rush> Tovler: no ... then the earth lived
<Saturn> 08,01it featured scantily clad young women dancing in jutting, fierce movements
<Tovler> Spectrum_Rush: proof?
<GilDash> Saturn: I think I'm starting to understand why you like this piece so much. :p
<cowvarkian> <.<
<Saturn> 08,01bear in mind that this premiere took place in France in 1913
<cowvarkian> water we watching
<Kencolt> keep watching, Tovler and you'll see.
<Canadian_Brony> Tovler you're living on it
<Tovler> -.o so much lag.
<Saturn> 08,01the audiences were confused, outraged, and angry at it
<Canadian_Brony> cowvarkian "Fantasia"
<AJIsAwesome> cowvarkian: Fantasia.
<cowvarkian> oh cool
<Saturn> 08,01so much so, in fact, that halfway through the performance, a riot broke out in the auditorium
<Saturn> 08,01an actual riot
<Applejack2012> There needs to be a 20 min PMV of this
<Quick_Thinker> 1913 AND THEY WERE ANGRY AT IT FUCK THEM
<cowvarkian> Saturn: dafuq
<Vivix|Woops> Hehe
<MadSurge> Saturn: fucking imbecils
<Quick_Thinker> seriously this is a master piece
<XAX> Wait, we're watching Fantasia? The Disney movie?
<Vivix|Woops> Things take time
<Saturn> 08,01this drove Stravinsky into a depression
<Kandarihu> Well, they didn't like that sort of choreography.
<Vivix|Woops> Of the impressionist, I only really know Arne Nordheim
<Canadian_Brony> XAX clips from it, yes
<MadSurge> XAX: parts of it, yes
<Saturn> 08,01thogugh later, the piece was better received
<Quick_Thinker> 1913 man i thought anmanition started in the time before WWII not that far back
<XAX> :o
<Sumica> 00,10spore, the animation
<Quick_Thinker> i mean wow
<Vivix|Woops> 1913 is the music, the naimation is 1940
<Spectrum_Rush> spore before spore
<Tovler> If those 1913 people thought they were mad, I hate to imagine how they reacted to jazz.
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, this piece contains many references, allusiions, and paraphrases of Russian folk music
<cowvarkian> Saturn: are we suddenly talking about the rite of spring?
<Quick_Thinker> 1940 okay thats still amazing
<Dark_Horst> hey guys, just got done installing guild wars 2 and now my charr needs a name. any ideas?
<Canadian_Brony> cowvarkian yeah. We're also watching it
<Quick_Thinker> mc hoofer
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: Slate Fistcrunch.
<MadSurge> Saturn: thank god
<Kencolt> Quick_Thinker: Oh, the music was done much before the animation. At least, the animation we see here.
<cowvarkian> oh, cool
<Dark_Horst> btw, charr is the race, nto a typo
<Meanwhile> DaringDerpy: Big Mclargehuge
<cowvarkian> ikr
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: imma try that
<DaringDerpy> tab fail
<Saturn> 08,01stravinsky was trying to awaken the nacent "folk memory" of russian past; i consider this a very nationalistic piece
<MadSurge> Sealife! :3
<Spectrum_Rush> Tovler: now are you seeing... that violent displace wasnt the death of the world... it was its birth
<Saturn> 08,01again, feel free to disagree with me
<Quick_Thinker> mr mc hoofer doo
<Meanwhile> Yeah tab fail. Roll Fizzlebeef.
<DaringDerpy> stop doing that
<Vivix|Woops> I know way too little about classical music
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn I got nothin'
<Vivix|Woops> Have you heard Nordheim Saturn? Impressionism and modernism dude
<Canadian_Brony> I can't argue with something I know nothing about
<Sumica> 00,10I cant disagree due to lack of knolage on the subject
<Saturn> 08,01but much as the piece is about the awakening of the earth, and the Rite which brings this forth, Stravinsky was reaching into the past and awakening the forgotten musical history of his homeland
<Tovler> hm, I thought Man-o-wars floated on the surface
<Kencolt> Saturn: I can't disagree. But along came the Bolsheviks, and they ruined it for everyone. Including the Bolsheviks.
<cowvarkian> ikr Vivix|Woops
<Canadian_Brony> I can't disagree due to no knowledge on the subject.
<Dken2021> well Saturn, looks like you're he einstein of early music here
<Quick_Thinker> man i cant imagine how pissed this made other religions
<Klumzeedragon> *nibbles ribs and watches*
<Meanwhile> I 'aint sayin' nothin' because I don't know jack about what you're talkin' 'bout.
<Saturn> 08,01Dken2021: it's funny, because i don't consider this early at all!
<Saturn> 08,01this is some of the latest music i'm really interested in
<MadSurge> Saturn: do go on :) I'm interested!
<cowvarkian> this isnt really early music
<Eli> Saturn: you don't like modern music?
<Dken2021> well I know this wasn't in the classical era
<Saturn> 08,01i consider renaissance and baroque to be early music
<cowvarkian> well
<Canadian_Brony> I consider this to be early music
<Vivix|Woops> I like most 1920+, there's very few things I don't like. Harshnoise and stuffi ncluded
<Saturn> 08,01Dken2021: aye; this was 2 'eras' after. classical -> romantic -> 20th century
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: i think it worked xD
<cowvarkian> lyre is early music
<LadyCanary> Oooh ooh! Im going to be learning about that later in my semester in music, Saturn!
<Canadian_Brony> I feel so young in this conversation
<MadSurge> THIEF
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: Score.
<Dark_Horst> Meanwhile: login servers overloaded, though
<Quick_Thinker> man i like how big of a risk disney took while making this movie
<Tovler> is this song even 100 years old?
<Meanwhile> Dark_Horst: As usual.
<Vivix|Woops> Tovler next year I think
<Canadian_Brony> Tovler almost
<Spectrum_Rush> 99
<Saturn> 08,01somewhere, i have a 3,000 essay i wrote on the significance of Russian folk tradition in The Rite of Spring
<Quick_Thinker> they could have sccrapped this idea becuase they feared it might fail, but they stuck to thier guns and man did it pay off
<cowvarkian> cool saturn
<Canadian_Brony> O____________O
<Tovler> I so wish Tree of Life was more like this.
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not sure i want to link it, though, as i wrote it about 7 years ago, and i disagree with some of what i wrote now
<Sumica> 00,10I presume you meen creationisum verses darwinisum Quick_Thinker
<Vivix|Woops> most the big movies from Disney around 1940 did fail, but were succesfull later on
<Quick_Thinker> yeah Sumica
<Saturn> 08,01*3,000 word
<cachi01|phone> Hi everypony :)
<Dken2021> allo cachi01|phone

<cowvarkian> Sumica: was creationism in existance then?
<cachi01|phone> You guys heard of hearthfire and adventure time videogame?
<Sumica> 00,10not sure
<Quick_Thinker> ADVENTURE TIME WAHT
<cowvarkian> Not sure when that term came into use
<cachi01|phone> VIDE
<cachi01|phone> O
<Vivix|Woops> If anyone want to hear odd things, look up Arne Nordheim - Solitaire , and Merzbow
<Quick_Thinker> NO BUCKIN WAY
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, i guess the take home thigns from what i said are: Rite of Spring is awesome; Stravinsky is awesome; I know a *lot* about music
<cachi01|phone> GAAAME
<Saturn> 08,01well, "classical" music
<cowvarkian> ikr saturn
<Dken2021> cachi01|phone yea, and the adventure time exclusives that come with it
<Vivix|Woops> I know next to nothing about anything before 1960
<Canadian_Brony> I took a 5-page essay on Las Vegas and compromised it into a 5-slide powerpoint presontation which I displayed to my English class.
<MadSurge> We need a FiM game before Adventure Time, dammit!
<Tovler> one of these days, I'll look up neo-classical music.
<BronyInstrumental> hello everypony, whaddid i miss?
<cowvarkian> when did the titanic happen, Vivix|Woops
<Vivix|Woops> 1914?
<cachi01|phone> Hearthfire DLC just let you build houses
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix|Woops: i'm the inverse! i know a lot about 1400 - 1960, but not much after
<cowvarkian> ...
<AJIsAwesome> BronyInstrumental: Hello! Some Fantasia.
<cowvarkian> no
<cachi01|phone> And adopt children
<cowvarkian> 1912
<Quick_Thinker> a FiM game will probely fail if we give it to hasbro to do
<Tovler> Adventure Time is older though.
<SirGanjalf> cowvarkian: 1912
<Quick_Thinker> just saying
<Canadian_Brony> I had to condense 7 paragraphs into a 3-minute long presentation
<Vivix|Woops> I had art history education abo 1400-1920, but music education only 1920-1999
<Tovler> mmm, ground bread
<cowvarkian> SirGanjalf: I was testing Vivix|Woops's knowledge
<SirGanjalf> oh
<Eli> Saturn: uh... i could hook you up with a friend of mine, you would have hours of talking :P not really my style tho

<Quick_Thinker> like how t-Rex kills one and the rest are just likke ehhh whatevsss man
<SirGanjalf> Though it might be because my window is open

<GilDash> cowvarkian: I was about to type a lengthy, sarky reply, but you beat me to the punch. Bravo. :D
<Quick_Thinker> and Lil_B and some times vice versa

<Vivix> I once took a drum midi track and fed it into a synth, sounded like trance
<AJIsAwesome> Got to go, guys. Have a meeting to go to.

<Eli> is it me, or is that really old animation way more carefully done than most of todays animations?
<cowvarkian> yes
<Kencolt> OK-- Walt was NOT smoking his usual cigar when he thought of THIS.
<Canadian_Brony> Eli it's not just you
<MadSurge> Eli: nope, you're right
<Sumica> 00,10older animation had way higher framerates
<Applejack2012> No CGI animals or burp and fart jokes
<Eli> kinda sad if you think about it
<cowvarkian> ikr Sumica
<MadSurge> NOM
<Dken2021> we're at ostriches?
<Saturn> 08,01so there's a pisstake of this piece called Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah
<Applejack2012> öm nom
<Sumica> 00,10and animated each frame rather then using inbetween
<Applejack2012> om
<Saturn> 08,01anyone heard of it?
<Canadian_Brony> Dken2021 eeyup. Frefresh
<Bronysith> http://derpy.me/Oa81w
<MadSurge> NOT MY GRAPES
<Barbetos|AtWork> Saturn yes, its all I can think of.
<cowvarkian> yes, i have saturn
<Kandarihu> Oh yeah. I remember that, vaguely
<Saturn> 08,01it's about a jewish boy writing home to his parents abotu being on camp
<Eli> we should start doing animations frame by frame again...
<Saturn> 08,01it's qutie funny
<Kencolt> Saturn: I have. Haven't heard it in a while.
<MadSurge> NOOOOO THE GRAPES
<Canadian_Brony> Bronysith d'aww . . .
<Vivix> I thought old naimation still used two's?
<Vivix> animation*
<lowfn_Away> Ello everypony
<Dken2021> not the slimest hippo I've seen
<Canadian_Brony> hi lowfn
<Klumzeedragon> Saturn: There was also a version done for a flea commercial.
<lowfn> I'mback :)
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo lowfn
<Applejack2012> hi
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: most animation is on twos
<thelonepony> hai Lowfn
<Canadian_Brony> WB
<Vivix> Each cell should then be two frames, just like modern-
<MadSurge> Saturn: wut
<RAWRity> bonjour
<Lil_B> ... muddah and faddah as in is really gangasta slang german "Mutter" and "Vater" ?
<Saturn> 08,01Klumzeedragon: ooo, i've not heard that
<lowfn> dat hippo
<Vivix> Tweening is a manual process in everything except flash rigs, and it is rarely used outside because it looks horribly mechanical
<Klumzeedragon> Saturn: I think it was for... Advantix?
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: animated on twos means that the animation frame only changes ever second frame of film
<cowvarkian> sure, Lil_B
<Cavale> whole lota plot in this is my only comment
<Eli> Lil_B: aka mum & dad
<Saturn> 08,01*every
<RAWRity> Saturn: to what effect?
<Vivix> and in most, they alternate the twos, so it looks very fluid even if it would "seem" to be 12 fps
<MadSurge> Saturn: no, I mean the piece on the jewish boy
<Lil_B> Eli yes, but muddah und faddah is really just words real Hip Hop guys use or some accents
<Sumica> 00,10bah no crock bit
<Saturn> 08,01RAWRity: the animators don't have to draw as much, and it still gives a very smooth picture
<RAWRity> fair enough.
<MadSurge> I knew it, Dance of the Hours!
<Klumzeedragon> Saturn: Yep, found it on teh youtube. Want the limk?
<Sumica> 00,10and just because I love this one
<cowvarkian> Lil_B: hip hop in what society?
<Saturn> 08,01Klumzeedragon: sure!
<Klumzeedragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alk26XzDYF4
<MadSurge> AGAIN :D
<Saturn> 08,01oh, the racist ponies one again
<Dken2021> centaurs one?
<Eli> Lil_B: i'm swiss, remember? and my lil bro doesn't have much else to do than listening to gangsta rap
<cowvarkian> ikr saturn
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not too convinced it's racist
<RAWRity> Man, proto-MLP was fucking weird.
<MadSurge> UNICORNS
<thelonepony> Ponies!!!
<Saturn> 08,01but yeah
<Saturn> 08,01it was banned
<Dken2021> Saytr!
<cowvarkian> saturn, but I've seen this before
<GilDash> Saturn: How is this racist?
<Eli> Lil_B: german gangsta rap
<RAWRity> h fuck, Satyrs. RUN PONIES, BEFORE THEY FUCK YOU
<Saturn> 08,01so we have satyrs, do we also have nymphs?
<SirGanjalf> Saturn: Because of the little black pegasi?
<CrimsonPhoenix> PONY
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: imagine you're living in 1940s america
<Kandarihu> I don't see what's so racist about this.
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: and wait for the black pegasi
<cowvarkian> saturn, where everything is black and white?
<Lil_B> cowvarkian the gangsta kinda society
<MadSurge> PEGASI
<Klumzeedragon> brb everyone.
<SirGanjalf> SirGanjalf: Oh, now i understand
<GilDash> Saturn: Why on earth would I want to imagine I was living there?
<thelonepony> the black Pegasia
<CrimsonPhoenix> We watching Disney MLP?
<SirGanjalf> Mixed marriages
<Tovler> is this the uncensored one?
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: for the purposes of explanation
<lowfn> Saturn: I think it twas banned because a WHITE puppy got the stuff and the black puppies didn't
<GilDash> Saturn: I'll try, despite my ignorance...
<Canadian_Brony> Yeah, now I see why they would think this as racist
<Kencolt> Saturn: Also, there were ... erotic connotations in certain parts that didn't fly so well either.
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Kandarihu> Well, Disney, LONG before My Little Pony. So it might as well be My Little Horse
<Saturn> 08,01eroticism and ponies?
<Canadian_Brony> I don't want to know where
<cowvarkian> sure
<Saturn> 08,01WHO'DA THUNK?
<Lil_B> Eli I knew that you are Swiss :) I just kinda missinterpreted what you said :(
<CrimsonPhoenix> wait
<MadSurge> Aww <3
<CrimsonPhoenix> this is DISNEY?
<SirGanjalf> yeeyup
<CrimsonPhoenix> I was just kidding at that
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: wut? where?
<Kencolt> Saturn: Not the "pony" parts, but others...
<MadSurge> CrimsonPhoenix: YEP
<Kandarihu> But really, it's more like My Little Mythological Creature
<Saturn> 08,01Kencolt: ah, okay
<cowvarkian> wait, so this got misinterpreted as racist because the mix raced couple of pegasi treated their white kid better?
<Canadian_Brony> I have no comment on this discussion.
<Eli> Lil_B: are you into german rap?
<lowfn> I'm not sure whats worse... this... or G3
<GilDash> Saturn: It might just be me, but I really am struggling to see anything "racist" about this. :S
<RAWRity> We should totally show Song of the South on here sometime, or the old Propoganda shorts Disney did during WWII
<MadSurge> So adorable :3
<Kandarihu> lowfn, G3
<CrimsonPhoenix> lowfn, THIS? WORSE THAN G3?
<cowvarkian> ikr RAWRity
<Canadian_Brony> lowfn G3. This s adorable
<Cavale> lowfn g3
<Eli> Kandarihu: G3 has nothing on this
<Saturn> 08,01this is absolutely beautifully animated
<Dken2021> hmm, wonder if a saytr will show up in season 3, they already got minotaurs and cockatrices
<Lil_B> Eli NO!
<MadSurge> Saturn: agreed
<Kencolt> cowvarkian: No, it's because there was a black pegasus and a while pegasus-- and in the Deep South, at that time, that could be a VERY TOUCHY SUBJECT.
<Tovler> The quality looks a bit high for this to be the uncensored version.
<Dark_Horst> dunno about you guys, but i think this is beautiful as fuck
<Eli> Lil_B: i like that answer :) a lot.
<lowfn> I like the animation... but the noses.....
<CrimsonPhoenix> lowfn, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3646/
<Lil_B> My little Centaur, My little Centaur, aahh ahhh AHHH AHHH
<cowvarkian> no, I know, kencolt
<Saturn> 08,01i want to be one of those pegasi :(
<SirGanjalf> Don't compare this to G3:|
<RAWRity> so...what was racist about that...at all?
<lowfn> CrimsonPhoenix: :'(
<cowvarkian> Nothing, really
<GilDash> Okay... so where was the racism?
<Cavale> @Saturn same
<Kandarihu> So, it's a depiction OF racism that's the problem?
<cowvarkian> Its just that it was a mixed race couple
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix I'm bookmarkin that one
<Sumica> 00,10GilDash, black horse and white horse
<MadSurge> :O
<Dken2021> people saying racism becuase black and white, oh you poor prejudice souls
<MadSurge> IS THIS

<Canadian_Brony> Sumica this is awesome! Yay!
<Cavale> lol old school donald duck
<GilDash> Sumica: ... Is this litterally just because the horse happens to be black? -_-
*RAWRity demands we show Der Fuhrer's Face
<Tovler> During the centaur skit. there's a dorky back maid centaur girl that's hard to look at.
<Saturn> 08,01GilDash: i think that was the editted version
<Eli> thelonepony: i so hate dolan
<MadSurge> Nut jam?!
<lowfn> yay
<Canadian_Brony> StinkomanFan STFU and GTFO. I like Chip and Dale
<lowfn> yay
<Applejack2012> Used to love this
<killerpony7733> RAWRity We had that showed once
<Lil_B> RAWRity we alreadey had that once
<Sumica> 00,10yes GilDash, but that version was unedited.
<Saturn> 08,01in the original, there's a scene where a black pony is polishing the shoes of a white pony or something
<LadyCanary> RAWRity!
<Sumica> 00,10the edited version had the color changed
<RAWRity> LadyCanary!
<Canadian_Brony> if only it were that easy
<LadyCanary> ..omg CHIP AND DALE <3
<GilDash> Oh right, okay. I'll just google it later.
<LadyCanary> Cuties <3
<MadSurge> Scumbag Donald :D
<DaringDerpy> http://2.asset.soup.io/asset/3615/6034_921f_500.png
<Saturn> 08,01i wasn't really paying much attention to it, to be honest
<RAWRity> Chip and Dale? unless they're Rescue Rangers, I'm not interested.
<Skye> Hello.
<Dken2021> DaringDerpy ahahaha
<SirGanjalf> DaringDerpy: ahahahahaha:D
<Cavale> fun fact on chipmonks only females have short tails
<Vivix> Other fun fact: all cows are female, tv messes this up ALL the tim
<Vivix> e
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: you *have* to show Coal Black!
<Eli> Cavale: well, this is awkward...
<Saturn> 08,01because that most definitely *is* racist
<Saturn> 08,01in pretty much every way
<LadyCanary> Aw, but they're cuuuuuuute RAWRity ;3;
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: wuts that?
<Sumica> 00,10they I should not show it
<Tovler> Coal Black and the Sebben Dwarves
<MadSurge> DaringDerpy: dat poor dog :D
<Vivix> Tom and jerry had a lot of blackface and old black slang, it is still unedited on air in Norway
<Saturn> 08,01but gosh darn, is it funny to laugh at the attitudes of the time
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: it's educational
<SirGanjalf> uh oh devil chipmunk
<lowfn> yay
<Dken2021> chip was the one with the black nose right?
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn: my dad showed me blazing saddles one time. what has been seen.......
<Canadian_Brony> Dken2021 beats me
<Saturn> 08,01Sumica: i think it's fine, so long as we watch it with a mature attitude, and acknowledge that yes, it is horrifically racist
<Tovler> Its fun to look at antebellum racism.
<MadSurge> Tovler: this
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn what is, this?
<Saturn> 08,01i mean, shit, we showed Blazing Saddles at BMN
<Saturn> 08,01Canadian_Brony: no, Coal Black
<Dark_Horst> blazing saddles was funny as fuck xD
<SirGanjalf> BronyInstrumental: Now Blazing Saddles we're anti-racist.
<MadSurge> Dat Dale :D
<Canadian_Brony> oh. Blazing Saddles was funny, and I've never heard of Black Coal
<Dken2021> I laugh at older black stereotypes anys because they're outrdated anyway
<Saturn> 08,01SirGanjalf: well okay, yes, it was taking the piss out of racists by example
<BronyInstrumental> SirGanjalf: what about it? and grammar, please translate
<Saturn> 08,01but still, it offended a lot of people
<lowfn> They don't need this much
<MadSurge> DED
<ShadowQuill> I'm Shadowlicious.
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: then said people needed to grow a sense of humor
<Canadian_Brony> lowfn Overkill. It doesn't exist
<ShadowQuill> UNCEL DOLAN?
<ShadowQuill> JK
<Vivix> When I saw things like- Jerry being captured by black cannibal mice as a kid, I never made a racial connection, pointing it ou as offensive made us aware of it
<lowfn> Somehow the jars are stacked
<Canadian_Brony> lowfn it's a cartoon
<StinkomanFan> BEES
<MadSurge> NOT THE BEES
<Dken2021> Bee Cannon!
<Canadian_Brony> No, not the bees! Not the bees! AAhhh, they're in my eyes!!
<MadSurge> DAT GOOFY SCREAM
<thelonepony> goofy scream
<ShadowQuill> EHEHEHEH
<StinkomanFan> Seriously, I HATE Chip and Dale.
<Barbetos|AtWork> when did goofy even get in there?
<Tovler> 1940s hollywood dark africa racism. meh, as a kid, I was just happy to see my people in cartoons.
<Saturn> 08,01we need some Tom and Jerry up in this shit.
<Canadian_Brony> Barbetos|AtWork it's a cartoon
<SirGanjalf> BronyInstrumental: Uh, sorry. I mean "Blazing Saddles" was mocking racist attitude in general.
<Canadian_Brony> Saturn hell yeah!
<Dken2021> Tovler at least we were in cartoons
<MadSurge> StinkomanFan: they're not very nice in their original shorts, but they got better in Rescue Rangers
<Barbetos|AtWork> Canadian_Brony: so are you applying logic to it then?
<SirGanjalf> I concur Saturn
<Bronysith> Saturn: yes please
<Canadian_Brony> Barbetos|AtWork logic? What's logic?
<Tovler> Dken2021: remember when they tried to ban Speedy Gonzales?
<thelonepony> Saturn agreed
<Vivix> Indeed Saturn, the old stuff, even if the space one had crazy noises
<Saturn> 08,01heh
<Saturn> 08,01nuts.
<Vivix> "boioioioioing"
<BronyInstrumental> SirGanjalf: i know, it's funny but my dad thinks they wer ebeing serious so he showed it to me when i was 12 to try to get me to believe the stuff they say, cause he's a prick like that
<Applejack2012> I love RR
<Canadian_Brony> spittake
<BronyInstrumental> were*
<BronyInstrumental> being*
<MadSurge> Tovler: but mexicans loved Speedy Gonzales! :D
<Kencolt> The best thing about Rescue Rangers was Gadget.
<SirGanjalf> BronyInstrumental: :D
<Canadian_Brony> army trumpet
<Eli> funny fact about chip and dale: germans called them squirrel A and squirrel B
<Applejack2012> Gadget was besty
<Applejack2012> best
<CrimsonPhoenix> I LOVE Dr.Dissonance
<MadSurge> Kencolt: Rescue Rangers was one of my fav childhood cartoon :$
<Dark_Horst> in russia, there's a cult who built a religion around gadget hackwrench
<Dark_Horst> scary stuff
<Vivix> There's also a flanders cult
<Tovler> MadSurge: ikr? I'm thinking hollywood was ultra PC in the late 90s
<Vivix> not serious, obviously, but still, funny
<Lil_B> Eli yeah... at the begining they were just "A Hörnchen" and "B Hörnchen" XD and later... man what were their names >.<
<Tovler> for a time there were no guns in cartoons
<Vivix> hence batman
<Eli> Lil_B: chip and chap
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: hehehe, Hoernchen
<Vivix> I still think guns in cartoon is bad thing unless it's teen, but yeah
<MadSurge> NOT THE EGGS DALE
<Lil_B> Eli yes!
*Saturn 08,01nuzzles Lil_B
<Vivix> Snipp og Snapp in norway
*Lil_B nuzzles Saturn back ;)
<Canadian_Brony> dat chicken impression
<Eli> Lil_B: yeah, no idea how they got to those names...
<Canadian_Brony> d'aawwww
<thelonepony> so cute!
<MadSurge> ARE YOU MY MOMMY?
<Kandarihu> Tovler, yes. They were really badly censored in the 1990s. That's pretty much why I pretty much jumped ship as soon as I discovered anime.
<Saturn> 08,01why do i find shy europeans so attractive? :P
<MadSurge> Saturn: oh u€
<Applejack2012> Scoot jokes
<Cades> good job haha
<Eli> Saturn: do i have to hide now?
<BronyInstrumental> Saturn, don't make me get a restraining order on yo' ass
<MadSurge> STOP IT MUMMY
<Fritz> wait
<Saturn> 08,01oh *that* one is definitely scoots
<Lil_B> Saturn did I really appear so shy?
<Fritz> I'm a shy European
<Fritz> :3
<Fritz> not.
*DrSteveSCARz is still cleaning laptop
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: you did, aye
<Fritz> What is this we're watching
<Tovler> I was shocked when I saw all the innuendo in Disney Channel's Gravity Falls.
<MadSurge> YOU IDIOT
<Saturn> 08,01Lil_B: maybe you were just nervous at meeting someone from l'interwebs
<Canadian_Brony> Fritz a Chip and Dale cartoon
<Bunny_Striker> BACK FROM SCHOOL!!!
<Fritz> Oh, aight.
<Vivix> I thought animation had very free rains in the 1990s, cut back in 2001, still cut back even more now, and extremely free in the 1930s
<Meanwhile> Trolled by an egg.
<shibaru> Mike answered my "do you speak whale?" question
<fluttermac> hugs canadian_ brony
<shibaru> He said
<shibaru> "is that a fat joke?"
<Canadian_Brony> hi Bunny_Striker. School already? Ouch
<Spectrum_Rush> seems legit
<Fritz> heh
<Canadian_Brony> hi fluttermac
<SirGanjalf> not suspicious at all
<Fritz> I still think some of those very old cartoons are better than the ones today.
<fluttermac> hi
<Fritz> Like, this one. Or Tom and Jerry. Or Looney Toons.
<Vivix> Fritz yeah
<Bunny_Striker> Canadian_Brony: and I joined the football team too...
<Spitfire> lol
<Vivix> It's one of the few times I'd agree with such statements
<fluttermac> hwo is that pony
<Vivix> But, Animation is picking up thanks to technology and creativity
<Lil_B> Saturn that and my poor speaking skills in english :/ I AM shy, but I could talk with all the other right away without a Problem, And yes, the excitement of meeting someone from the Webz :)
<SirGanjalf> Now that's one big, angry cock...
<Fritz> Yeah, but come on
<Kencolt> On the other hand... toons like Clutch Cargo... me mind rebells at those memeories.
<Fritz> I don' feel like watching some stupid 3D horsepoop.
<Spectrum_Rush> nag nag nag
<Klumzeedragon> That child abuse.
<Klumzeedragon> xD
<Kandarihu> Western animation was very censored in the 1990s, probably to give concerned parents a refuge from the dark age of comic books (which was spilling over into video games too)
<Fritz> I'd rather watch some old 2D classics.
<Tovler> Foghorn Leghorn would have acted much more civil.
<Fritz> oh god
<SirGanjalf> :D
<Vivix> Fritz indeeeeeeed, Cheap CGI 3D just ruins everything instantly
<Fritz> " 's gonna be liek in Doom"
<Spitfire> oblivious mother chicken is oblivious
<Dark_Horst> the day people stopped doing handdrawn animations was a sad day. i mean, just LOOK at the lion king
<Eli> Fritz: uhh... 3D... i mean, avatar was good, but welll...
<Vivix> but Simpsons was allowed to speak about homosexuality, and show partial nudity, things they have trouble with now, but did not have then?
<Fritz> Well, I didn' mean Avatar
<Canadian_Brony> and not a single Scootaloo joke was made
<Fritz> I rather meant cartoons
<Canadian_Brony> I am proud of you
<Bronysith> YES
<Bronysith> FUCK YES
<MadSurge> TOM AND JERRY
<Tovler> remember how guns shot lasers in the 90s Spider-man cartoon?
<Spitfire> YES
<Vivix> Simpsons is sitll handdrawn Dark_Horst, and about 30% if MLP is I guess
<Fritz> PEW PEW?
<Tovler> Droopy Dog!!?
<SirGanjalf> That episode:D
<Fritz> YES
<Canadian_Brony> YAY
<Spademagnes[R]> Hi guys

<Spademagnes[R]> I've been busy playing Mario Kart Ds for a while

<Eli> 3D movies are fine, but digitally alterd movies turned into 3D are hell
<MadSurge> I REMEMBER THIS EPISODE
<Buytoast> oh my, tom and jerry eh?
<Fritz> This will be always, and WILL ALWAYS be better than any of those sheety
<Fritz> what were they called
<Cavale> :D
<Lil_B> the world is ready for 3D when they figure out to do it without giving people headache and make it work to watch it in 2D too
<Vivix> Cheap 3D = horrible, Expensive 3D = good
<MadSurge> HAAAAAAAAX
<Canadian_Brony> Tilt!
<Fritz> bakugans, demopans
<Lil_B> 3D TV I mean
<Fritz> all those things
<Tovler> Droopy cartoons blew my mind as a child.
<Spademagnes[R]> What movies make 3d work well?
<MadSurge> PHYSICS
<Fritz> lol
<Canadian_Brony> MadSurge you beat me to it
<Fritz> NOW THIS IS A CARTOON
<Vivix> Oh I mean CGI, not 3D glasses, I don't like that at all
<Klumzeedragon> I don't think theres many Tom and Jerry's I HAVENT seen.
<Tovler> Tex Avery in general was too funny.
<StinkomanFan> WOOPWOOPWOOP
<MadSurge> Canadian_Brony: sorry :D
<tSparx> Howdy everypony!
<BronyInstrumental> why is there a mouse living in a pool table?
<Cavale> strike
<Pearly> hey everypony, Perly returned
<Spademagnes[R]> Now why would Jerry live in a pool table?
<Fritz> It's cute, check. Makes me laugh, check. Doesn't have unnecessary effects and is made by a respected animation studio, check.

<Fritz> Physics? Walt Disney never attended a physics class.
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo CCCP

<Fritz> ll
*Canadian_Brony cringes
<Cavale> ow
<DrSteveSCARz> DAT SCREAM
<Spademagnes[R]> Does Tom ever win?
<Bronysith> I LOVE THAT SCREAM
<Applejack2012> Twilight disapproves after Pinkie Keen
<Eli> not exactly a stick up the rump, but it's not bad
<Canadian_Brony> Spademagnes[R] no
<Pearly> tSparx, that too
<Dark_Horst> i felt that
<MadSurge> Dat scream :D
<StinkomanFan> Tom and Jerry taught me how a shotgun works :)
<Fritz> I love the voice actor
<Pearly> Nothing would get done
<Fritz> that produces those Tom screams
<SirGanjalf> Spademagnes[R]: I remember one, maybe two eps
<Barbetos|AtWork> Spademagnes[R]: no. It some times ends in a draw you could say
<Fritz> he's just amazing
<Spademagnes[R]> I find it amusing that Tom and jerry arent ALWAYS dicks to each other
<MadSurge> NOM
<Spademagnes[R]> Sometimes they are sort of pals
<tSparx> Spademagnes[R]: Well, there's an episode where they both kill themselves. So there is an episode where Jerry loses, but no, Tom doesn't win.
<Canadian_Brony> perfect break!
<Kimi> LOL
<Tovler> I thought Anvils were just for dropping on foe's heads.
<Vivix> I like the episodes where they make fun of hilter, it's so strange
<Fritz> gg
<Fritz> next round pls
*Pearly hugs tSparx
<MadSurge> tSparx: actually there were episodes where Tom won
<Fritz> IT'S FROM 1948?!
<Fritz> THE HUMANITY
<Michael> ohai everypony :D
<Spademagnes[R]> Is the person who made Tom and Jerry still around?
<MLP_Brovakiin> Hallo Michael
<MadSurge> Hey Michael!
<SirGanjalf> Vivix: Tom & Jerry made fun of Hitler?
<Applejack2012> hi
<Vivix> I think both died
<Klumzeedragon> Early tweety bird.
<RAWRity> MadSurge: and then there's the episode where Tom and Jerry commit suicide in front of a train.
<tSparx> MadSurge: Oh truly? Well, I'll go ahead and admit to not being the hugest fan of T&J, even as a kid.
<Fritz> I am so uneducated in terms of animation.
<cachi01|phone> Hi Michael!
<Vivix> Hana Barbera?
<Barbetos|AtWork> Technically the tom and Jerry cartoons just end before you see tom doing any winning. Typically Tom does a lot of damage to Jerry in the begining of the cartoons
<Barbetos|AtWork> So...
<BronyInstrumental> hallo Michael
<tSparx> So there's a lot Idk about this show.
<Fritz> SirGanjalf: No, but Walt and Barbera brothers made some shorts.
<Barbetos|AtWork> Winning is kind of subjective really
<Spademagnes[R]> Do you think this would be allowed to air now adays?
<Lil_B> hia Michael !
*tSparx glomps Pearly in return
<MadSurge> tSparx: mostly episodes where Jerry was being the biggest dick
<Tovler> I restrained myself when someone brony here said, Who's Hanna Barbera?
<Vivix> SirGanjalf, yeah, in one episode where eh..they are throwing eggs at eachother, and making paper planes filled with eggs, Jerry draws a hitler hairdo and moustache on a picture of Tom
<SirGanjalf> Fritz: oh
<CCCP> hello Michael

<BronyInstrumental> most useless cage ever
<Fritz> SirGanjalf: Aye, there were some shorts, like Donald Duck being a Nazi, and/or a propaganda movie about nazi education
<Spademagnes[R]> Anyone remember the days when cartoons were really violent?
<Lil_B> Tovler I think I asked that ...
<Fritz> No.
*Michael hugs thelonepony
<Tovler> Cartoon made me believe my heart was on the left side of my body instead of the center of your ribcage.
<SirGanjalf> Vivix: I think i recall something...
<DrSteveSCARz> If an ed edd n eddy episodes gets shown i will shit bricks
*Pearly hugs Michael and gives him tea and cookies
<Vivix> Hana Barbera were two guys, can't remember their first names, but they are responsible for a lot of the greats in tv cartoons
<tSparx> Tovler: Well, that's how it is.

<Spademagnes[R]> I miss Courage...
<Lil_B> Tovler well... your heart isn't in the center...
*DrSteveSCARz hugs fluttermac
<Dovah> Tovler: umm who told you it was in the center?

<Fritz> And the excitement when there was a new episode of Ed, Edd n' Eddy
<SirGanjalf> Fritz: The short with the Donald is called "In the Fuehrer's Face" and it was nominated to the Oscar if i remember.

<Science_Brony> I was thinking about colour the other day, and I made a connection. The light spectrum is 7 colours, the rainbow is 6 colours, and yet we also have mixtures of Red, Green, and Blue; or Yellow, Magenta and Cyan. These 6 colours are made of each other and can be mixed to make an opposite colour.
*LunaTheBeloved hugs Rex_Mundi
<Nittany_Twilight> 11,01Manual transmission car?
<Science_Brony> Basically, we have 4 ways to make colour.
<Science_Brony> Which is correct?
