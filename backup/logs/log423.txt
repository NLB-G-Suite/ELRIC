<TheRainbowDash> This is like Guitar Hero meets DJ Hero meets Japan.:D
<Dark92Enigma> ........AT LEAST ''WE GOTTA POWER''?
<Vinyl> AAAAAAAA
<DocSane> Their method for determining who was supposedly affected was, on the next day to ask school kids "Did you feel sick after watching Pokemon last night? If so, you can go home early."
<cachi01> no im not AND I WILLL NEVER BE
<Simon2> What am I watching... O_O
<LunaTheBeloved> Oh my...

<kirzstryfe> 1,3does the actual timing of the music seem off to anyone else? ignoring lag
<drf|osx> and when I turned what I thougth were channels 3 and 4 on
*Reikim pulls Renard back
<TheRainbowDash> TrololoVinyl and Vinyl What is this madness?:D

<drf|osx> the automated computer was off
<RX-78-SweetieBot> the one called excatly what I typed out
<drf|osx> so therefore, left only
<drf|osx> I caught it during my second song
<Renard> kirzstryfe, the timing solely depends on what the player do
<drf|osx> and turned 4 on
<Hatsune_Miku_Fan> It seems off for me
<otakon> kirzstryfe: it's not the original track I'm sure

<Alister> Dken2021 : Rhytm games were cool when they had cool rock songs. But then Music companies start giving money to game studios so they'll put in their shitty bands
<sonicdude558> This is my first time seeing this game
<LunaTheBeloved> Don't worry, Be happy

<Bronysith> Cipher hey how can i recomend a star wars original trilogy marathon do i ask for it in the lotto

Like Dr Robotnik from The Adventures oF Sonic the Hedgehog.........

<Pinkies4thWall|NOMZ> (inferring Pinkie is a dirty girl)
<Ryunosuke> http://www.fimfiction.net/story/20039/1/Pony-Confessions-/Chapter1%3A-Celestia :)
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Well that battle didnt end well...
<cachi01> PFFT I can beat this level without dying :)
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP I challenge you to a rock off!
<Darf14> If I can beat this stage surely he can beat it as well
<Reikim> Sumica: I've seen that, and it's much worse than this.
<Darkts3> this game looks awesome
<CCCP> TheRainbowDash: no i dont like you, but unfortuantly my ignore command isn't working

<Shane377> SuperBrony64: you should try Techno Kitty Adventures
<TheRainbowDash> CCCP: Ugh, just do not talk to me then...:|
<Krakass> I once beat this stage in 10 seconds flat.
<WindWhistler> Sumica: You mean like Touhou?
<Sumica> 00,10yeah
<ThunderHammerDangerF> The catharsis you get when you finally get to murder that chest is the most satisfying feeling
<Biglaw> TheRainbowDash I now have 29 republics
<Alister> TheRainbowDash : Can I still talk to you ?
<Ryunosuke> Alister, apparently :)
<Sir_lockpicker> lah

*DeathStar dances on Sir_lockpicker s head
<Biglaw> TheRainbowDash No... MONEY!
<Dark92Enigma> Performs a Stone Cold Stunner on CCCP
<Sir_lockpicker> :D
<Kandarihu> That death animation is horrifying. The moment of impact and his death are separated by almost a second. It's almost as if he could struggle for survival, but there's no way to survive once he's been slightly injured.
<Alister> Dat Violin ?
<Darf14> Im worried that SB64 wont get past the dark underwater section :(
<That_British_Guy> dat Banjo
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> Dark92Enigma: I'm going to Raw on monday.

<Shamroc> dang this game is vilent
<TheRandomkid321> dont quit rythm heaven...
<Reikim> This looks like it's more frustrating than trying to 1cc Mountain of Faith on anything other than easy. That's a hell of a feat.
<MahBoi777> PIRATES
<Darf14> Curse you electric Seaweed!!
<otakon> ARRRRRR
<cachi01> still easier game than touhou
<FlareChaser> inb4 ragequit
<Dark92Enigma> CCCP You will hate me for this----- It'S A wrestling move
<That_British_Guy> the banjo just makes it all but funner :D
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> cachi01: Touhou isnt THAT hard.
<Reikim> cachi01: Have you tried Touhou? Damn hard series.
<cachi01> Shibakuzou_WallDives: hardest difficulty
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> compared to refleX and Mushihime?
<Darf14> At least its not as hard as IWBTG

<FaithHeart> pikorar, you there?
<Reikim> cachi01: I know, because I have the same :P
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> what? Mushihime-sama? or RAW?
<WindWhistler> But it looked like he was gonna fall for the evil trap this level has
<otakon> well that sucked it didn't even continue him from there
<Spectrum_Rush> suidive
<twilight_sprinkle> i hate games like this, that make me replay the whole lvl if i die once

<Biglaw> TheRainbowDash I have the bottom half of my track full of Republics :D
<Reikim> cachi01: I have come within literal millimetres of beating Imperishable Night. I raged so hard after that that I quit Touhou for a whole week.
<Sumica> 00,10what the evil trap that you just run to the left instead of to the right?
<Polydunami> Season 2 is over, you guys
<FlareChaser> Alister: Pretty much, not that hard to make.
<Dark92Enigma> Shibakuzou_WallDives Lucky you i'm from Chile......I'm still a member of the YES! army

<junh1024-XD> i would suggest some classical ones but you'r not that into classical
<Marx> Well, don't reveal anything about it. I'm gonna get the game and see for myself.
<cachi01> u know what sucks???? getting killed by a metapod..... and we all know thats impossible
<MrBen> cachi01, agreed
<HeroBrine_theBrone> Every on paste whatever they have copied
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Does copycat work for the turn before it or is it only for the current turn?

<Biglaw> cachi01 well, if the metapod uses struggle...
<Darf14> I predict.....Super Smash bros Brawl
<junh1024-XD> you might find 1 or 2 of those in SACD in your lib
<WindWhistler> cachi01: Actually it's not.
<Pinkies4thWall|NOMZ> insert DEESK to give a TWEEST to ZEE DEEEKS

<MrBen> Brawl. Brawl. Brawl. Brawl!
<drf|osx> is it surround?
<Pinkies4thWall|NOMZ> *DEESK
<WindWhistler> If it evolved from a Caterpie, it would know an attacking move
<junh1024-XD> yes

<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> I hate when metaknight and dedede die you are out of luck
<junh1024-XD> 50%+ of SACDs/DVdaS are classical
<CCCP> i actually really like this game
<cachi01> compact star}!1
<junh1024-XD> just go to the library, check for rounded edge cases
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...Judging by the chatroom, is this Kirby Air Ride? O_O
<Shibakuzou_WallDives> Meta-Arceus-Ridley: ggs, considering the circumstances.
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> Gah I demand a rematch I only lost because of spore
<cachi01> CCCP: everyone loves this game :D
<drf|osx> I highly doubt the yhave them
<MahBoi777> Petrified_Discord: alright, lol:D
<drf|osx> as SACDs cost a lot more?
<Shane377> MahBoi777: and DeathStar this MahBoi777 to DeathStar http://www.google.com.au/imgres?q=if+you+know+what+i+mean&start=76&um=1&hl=en&sa=X&rlz=1C1MDNA_enAU416AU417&biw=1600&bih=813&tbm=isch&tbnid=SVvOq2gVXfOzFM:&imgrefurl=http://memegenerator.net/instance/16670267&docid=ENdgHpnkuptStM&imgurl=http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/16670267.jpg&w=400&h=400&ei=EsWcT8ThIs2biQfwxf3fDg&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=370&vpy=325&dur=3997&hovh=225&hovw=225&tx=118
<CrimsonPhoenix> YES

<Darf14> Fun Fact, Kirby Return to dreamland was going to be on Game cube, but It suffered from a very long time in limbow until it came out on the Wii
<Hatsune_Miku_Fan> CCCP: Who doesn't like this game?

<HeroBrine_theBrone> Does anyone want to try a bloody and gory game based apon Ripping of arms and legs while riding verious things?
<MahBoi777> Shane377: dat Mr. Bean xD
<Petrified_Discord> I'm tempted to go to ponychat just so I can see who it is...
<Meta-Arceus-Ridley> When you run out of health as metaknight or dededem your out for good
<cachi01> MrBen: lets make a petition

<Polydunami> Meta-Arceus-Ridley: What do you expect if it's called Dream Land?
<CrimsonPhoenix> it's the You shouldn't get ability
<Shane377> MahBoi777: this is u talking to my sis DeathStar http://derpy.me/jl-Ld
