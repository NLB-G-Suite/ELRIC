<Chibi_sparkle> i do hope trixie comes back though, mlp kinds lacks antanogists that actually stay
<d3rb> I wonder how the stream will cope today.
<HeavyMetalDash> I find your judgement of my character based off of the little knowledge you have on me a little confusing. But I give you the benefit of the doubt and give you my trust...consider the subject dropped
<TotallyNotABush> replace kinda with completely
<Critchley> Mobile internet, y u no stream without buffer >.<
<Clockwork> I woul

<TotallyNotABush> nope
<LordCelestia> 0,5Its okay, wel still have another three hours to go

<Critchley> so its 6 GMT? for the new episode?
<Meanwhile> Cavy: Well ok then.
<HeavyMetalDash> I'm kind of...outside the spectrum of most I find. Years of self analytical thought processes and a somewhat dark imagination have pretty much dulled my sence of humanity. Which actually explains my attraction to the show now that I think about...it re-introduced me to the emotions I thought I would be better of without...I think my heart just felt a pang of joy
<pony_9230> 1:00 pm
<FreezeFrame> 1300 Zulu time.
