<Sumica> 00,10it's not a program, it's hardware
<sonicandmario85> i know what happens when you delete system32
<prince-dari> It's where Microsoft puts all their restrictions to stop you from unlocking troo power of PC
<Scavender> Woah stargate
<Dark92Enigma> an HD*

<Count-Bleck> system 32?
*prince-dari raises the glass
<Bronysith> prince-dari: cheers mate
<prince-dari> System32 is where all your viruses are stored
<prince-dari> True story
<sonicandmario85> prince-dari:stop being an asshole trying to crash my computer
<Count-Bleck> delete it and you'll be free of virus forever (that's true since you won't have a system anymore)

<Bronysith> to all you final fantasy nuts...like me. what do you like better? dancing mad or one winged angel
<prince-dari> Because that's where all the cool shit is stored
<Sumica> 00,10I use 7 diffrent programs to scan my system

<Sergio_Scriptor> BaconMane: hurrah :)
<Zanon> Heya everypony!

<Sketch_Toku_Brony> so how does SG1 get later on? good or bad? lol only Star Gate I saw was the 90's movie :$
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sketch_Toku_Brony: it get's better with time :)
<Kandarihu> Sketch_Toku_Brony, SG-1 is awesome until the last couple of seasons.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Sketch_Toku_Brony: just wait till you get to the Ori :)
<Dark_Horst> Sketch_Toku_Brony: depends on who you asked. the later seasons played more on action than the early ones. i think it got better
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> huh ok
<sub06905> only a few 100 years
<Sergio_Scriptor> The Ori ARe freaking awesome
<Agrold> Sketch_Toku_Brony: SG-1 is pretty good all over, except for the 2 last seasons, at least IMO. They're not bad, they're just not the best ones I think

<Sergio_Scriptor> Count-Bleck: dont spoil anything or they will ban you man :\
<Kandarihu> Dang, for Gandalf to solo a Balrog with melee? He must be sum hybrid wizard.

<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04Gandalf goes up against Sauron, orcs, an evil wizard, AND a freakin' Balrog
<linsett> <@Ghost_of_Gandalf> Which one there are so many mr. mod
<TheMaster> dumbledore isn't a maiar though.

<linsett> <@Ghost_of_Gandalf> That would be badass
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: SERIOUSLY?!
<Dumblewhore> I prefer Dumbledore just because he never seems phased by anything
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> wow i didnt know that otakon
<TheMaster> Gandalf isn't actually human, he's a immortal angel of the same type as Sauron is. Immortal and extremely powerful.
<Cypresswolf> They should just make a movie with Gandalf fighting the Balrog :) I'd watch the *squee* out of that!
<AttacktheAndalite> Dumblewhore: Lolol dat name
<LordDerpington> I see bottoms every time I close me eyes.
<otakon> Ghost_of_Gandalf: actually just the Witch King of Angmar, Saruman, Orcs/Goblins/Uruk-Hai AND The Balrog.
<Count-Bleck> Sergio_Scriptor I mean everyone knows that,, I haven't watched the movie and I know that, so, but yes better not spoil it
<Ninjazz> Don't ever look down.
<TheMaster> they made a book about that Cypresswolf. its called the Simirallion.
<Ninjazz> And he looks down.
<EpicCookieTime> Why i cant see the broadcast :(
<otakon> GRAB!
<LordDerpington> Save the salt!

<Tamazarashi> yay its back Woo hoo!
<OohShiny> Gimme my precious1
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04Gollum just wants his sausages, guys D:
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gollum/Smeagol is a CGI character, but Peter Jackson wanted the character to be performer-oriented, so actor Andy Serkis, the voice of Gollum, played the character in a motion capture suit. Serkis also played scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Sean Astin (Sam) on set to give the actors a focal point. On those occasions when Serkis was actually in shot Gollum was
<Gimli> 1,11composited over him in post production.
<otakon> HE BITES HIM!
<OohShiny> ouch
<AJIsAwesome> Can anyone explain Gollum's origin stories for me?
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Yes, MY PRECIOUSSS stream is back!
<Dumblewhore> 'GIMME $20'
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: you'll find it
<Sundaysmile> might be a euphamism Ghost_of _Gandalf
<Pikachu> i finshed my model :3
<otakon> THE PRECIOUS
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04You'll find out later
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04AJIsAwesome
<otakon> my PRECIOUS.....
<TheMaster> yup. Thats what makes gollum so memerable. Andy Serkis put everything he had into the role. including nearly getting hypothermia
<eyesfire2> i wonder what a slenderman pony would look like
<OohShiny> daw
<Combustiblelemons> best cry ever
<CriticKitten> QUICK STAB HIM
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> AJIsAwesome: He used to be a Hobbit, but then he took a Ring to the soul.
<Rosfox> :(
<Michael> now back to the movie!
<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: it's beter explained in the third movie
<Count-Bleck> shivers

<Azuredragon> New pet
<otakon> Samwise_Gamgee: lol
<Rainbow-Crash> ninja'd
<AttacktheAndalite> Samwise_Gamgee: I need tree fiddy please
<AJIsAwesome> So why don't they kill him now?
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: pity
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol Samwise_Gamgee
<Michael> buaaaaaa
<Sundaysmile> comin for a walk doggie??
<OohShiny> why are they taking gollum?
<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: cuase he might be usefull
<CriticKitten> TREE FIDDY.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> It burns... almost like buffer:(
<Barbetos> eyesfire2 google slendermare
<BrOnyxia> tink
<Sundaysmile> doggiedoggiedoggie
<Pikachu> whts this moive called?
<DrSteveSCARz> oh its back
<TheMaster> because killing Gollum would be cruel. Gandalf discussed this with frodo in fellowship
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh hey it's a diamond dog
<eyesfire2> Barbetos thanks
<otakon> Pikachu: -_______-
<AJIsAwesome> OUR PRECIOUS GEMZ!!
<Sundaysmile> Pikachi - Terminator 2
<otakon> our.......PRECIOUS
<AttacktheAndalite> Is..is that drool? Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
<Pikachu> kk thx
<OohShiny> AttacktheAndalite, that's a collar
<TheMaster> The whole reason frodo can actually complete his mission to destroy the ring is because he's kind and able to do things Sauron can't comprehend (Ie. Mercy)
<AJIsAwesome> Seems legit.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TIVIA: The movie's line "My precious" was voted as the #85 movie quote by the American Film Institute (out of 100).
<BrOnyxia> kk
<AttacktheAndalite> OohShiny: Okay
<Pikachu> i thought this was harry potter XD
<Lil_B> Gimli what was number 1?
<eyesfire2> lolz that fact
<Kandarihu> TheMaster, I see.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Gimli, what's the #1?
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04"Myyyyy...sausagesssssss"
<Count-Bleck> I don't believe you
<Cypresswolf> LIAR!
<Azuredragon> the sound is kinda low, i have my computer volume maxed
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gollum says the word "precious" twenty times in this film.
*Michael dont believes on gollum
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15I think it was "Frankly my dear I don't give a damn"
<MisterBen> Azuredragon: Same.
<otakon> Ghost_of_Gandalf: we need someone to do something with that
<otakon> !
<cratorkid> i think #1 was frankly my dear , i dont give a damn from gone with the wind
<Combustiblelemons> only 20 times>?
*HorseLord_Striker has a tub of ice cream :3
<TheMaster> thats why mt.doom isn't guarded actually. Sauron believed there was nobody in middle earth who would even -want- to destroy the ring.
<CriticKitten> Samwise: The smartest hobbit in the entire film.
<Sundaysmile> THEY'RE TAKING THE HOBBITS TO ISENGARD!!!
<Combustiblelemons> feels much more than that.
<eyesfire2> says it twenty times? CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
<CriticKitten> Frodo: The dumbest.
<Cypresswolf> only 20...I thought I'd be more
<Count-Bleck> wait what?
<TheMaster> its actually impossible to throw the ring into mt.doom. its too corrupting.
<Michael> what have you done!
<Sergio_Scriptor> silly frodo :P
<AttacktheAndalite> Ohai SuperBrony64
<Cypresswolf> You will lead us to the Black Gate - Nope!
<MisterBen> I can barely hear the movie, too. I practically have the sound maxed.
<Gimli> 1,11He moves like one of those annoying as f**k video game leaders.
<Rainbow-Crash> Yup, still extended edition :D
<otakon> Meanwhile: I need that screencap of Gollum climbing down earlier!
<eyesfire2> lol
<Lil_B> Tha BLACK GATE! suddenly I wanne see Ultima
<Combustiblelemons> dat advanced schizophrenia
<TheMaster> about the only being in LOTR that could do it is Tom Bomdail, and thats because he's sort of god
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Ultima was awesome
<eyesfire2> accepted he doesn't lead you off a cliff.......twice
<Meanwhile> otakon: That hurt my ears.
<otakon> always the great eye
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> :O
<Michael> bwaaaa
<OohShiny> Gollum is tardis
<Count-Bleck> Hey!
<PitViper> Gollum giving new meaning to "Talking to Yourself"
<otakon> Meanwhile: but I need it
<OohShiny> gollum is tardy
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Dat split personality
<Meanwhile> otakon: And again.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis said he based Gollum's desperation and cravings on the withdrawals of heroin addicts.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15did he call him a bell end?
<Sergio_Scriptor> PitViper: :D
<CriticKitten> Lil_B: This story would be much shorter if the Avatar showed up.
<SuperBrony64> Hai AttacktheAndalite :)
<Combustiblelemons> otakon you don't need it.
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04>heroin addicts
<otakon> I NEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD IT!
<Gollum> Gollum does not meanz it. Gollum just want precious.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> <= They taking the hobbits to Isengard!
<beeep100> wtf? XD
<TheMaster> Orcs in sunlight? This is heresy!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Merry and Pippin are being carried off on the back of the Uruk'hai, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are in reality being carried on the backs of two stuntmen wearing oversized costumes and a false enormous head to give the impression of height disparity.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Gimli: seems about right
<otakon> dem orcs
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04Didn't we discuss the addictive effects of The One Ring yesterday, too?
<Combustiblelemons> gollum does look like a heroin addict now you mention it
<Meanwhile> Maggots.
<Cypresswolf> I'm surprised Sam & Frodo can keep up with Gollum so well, running through the rocky mountian rocks barefoot
<OohShiny> faggots
<Kandarihu> Ghost_of_Gandalf, yes we did.
<Combustiblelemons> soldier would like him
<MLP_Brovakiin> its planet of the apes
<otakon> maggots
<Count-Bleck> weren't orcs afraid of sunlight?
<eyesfire2> these facts..............why!
<Lil_B> CriticKitten depends, at the beginning of a game or the end ? XD
<TheMaster> I can understand that the Urukhai are out in daylight because of Saruman
<Gimli> 1,11Ghost_OF_Gandalf, yes we did.
<otakon> OohShiny: faggots are tiny bundles of twigs
<TheMaster> but the mordor orcs shouldn't be able to be out in day
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> Gollum looks more like a crack addict to me...
<Michael> smile!
<PitViper> Remember Hobbit feet are covered with fine hair and are actually more comfortable barefoot than when wearing shoes.
<TheMaster> funfact. Orcs are corrupted elves.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Blood?
<Cypresswolf> that looks tastey
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Orc juice that is poured down Merry's throat is a combination of peach juice and Sodastream cola concentrate.
<Meanwhile> Grog.
<Combustiblelemons> sounds delicious.
<LordDerpington> Still sounds fairly unpleasant.
<Tamazarashi> peach juice?
<Count-Bleck> delicious
<Pinkies4thWall> yay LOTR
<Lil_B> I would rink that :/
<Michael> tastes liek strawberries :p
<Gimli> 1,11That...actually sounds pretty good...
<Lil_B> drink*
<Pinkies4thWall> also, hi guys.
<Combustiblelemons> indeed it does
<CriticKitten> Yeah, but Pip is stupid, so of course it fooled him
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi Pinkies4thWall :)
<Meanwhile> Manflesh.
<eyesfire2> these facts arn't that random
<Lil_B> hi Pinkies4thWall :)
<Sundaysmile> It would be sugary as Hell

<MisterBen> Isn't Orc medicine also supposed to be really effective, if but horribly scarring?
<Lil_B> I now the smell of Manflesh HEPH HEPH HEPH HEPH HEPH
<otakon> MisterBen: it's basically strong beer
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Tell-tale signs (grayer hair, blotchy skin) are introduced to show that the Uruk'hai are an inbred set of creatures, who are already starting to erode.
<otakon> speaking of beer
<otakon> brb
<Cypresswolf> The herd is on the move
<Sundaysmile> Tell me your secrets rock!
<CrimsonPhoenix> Squallken, it is 7PM though
<Michael> goo gimli
<Kandarihu> Aragorn needs to take a shower. He smells like manflesh now
<TheMaster> well its not like Saruman could have added much more to the Morgoth template
<CrimsonPhoenix> almost 8 even
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15What do your elven eyes see!?
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04Aragorn is the Tom Whisperer
<OohShiny> lol

<killerpony7733> Oh yeah the actor who play Aragon is a danish actor or well sorta
<MLP_Brovakiin> Dwarfs are the best race
<CriticKitten> He's like a T-Rex.
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> dat New Zealand
<TheMaster> Viggo was awesome in this movie. He really threw himself into the Aragon role
<Sundaysmile> and then they danced to the isengard rave
<MisterBen> lol Gimli falling behind
<Gimli> 1,11<CriticKitten> Gimli is very dangerous over short distances.
<Gimli> 1,11Yes I am
<Lil_B> did the "We are taking the Hobbits to Isengard" scene already happen?
<DemoPegono> IMMA GONNA MAKE YA'LL-* snores *... eh... wha?
<Pinkies4thWall> oh hai Ghost_of_Gandalf.
<Combustiblelemons> YFW new zealand is where middle earth is.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In the wide shots of Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli running after the Orcs, all three performers are running injured. Orlando Bloom had a couple of broken ribs (from a fall off a horse); Viggo Mortensen had a broken toe (from kicking the helmet in the Orcs funeral pyre scene); and Brett Beattie (Gimli's stunt double) had a knee injury. Peter Jackson said that all three
<Gimli> 1,11were very dedicated and continued to film the scene, often yelling "ouch" or "ow" after "cut" was called.
<Meanwhile> Legolas's elven eyes can see many things, but can he see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch?
<CriticKitten> XD

<SirGanjalfTheGreen> :'(
<Dumblewhore> It's the tallest freestanding clock tower in the world
<Gimli> 1,11Title drop. It's purposely placed in all three films.
<nonody2> Nooo not the fluttershys
<Sundaysmile> Moredor wants More!
<Agrold> not fluttershy!:O
<Count-Bleck> Sergio_Scriptor: That means there won't be some cheesy fun?
<Lil_B> "I'm a Lumberjack and I'm Ok..."
<Combustiblelemons> a title drop is when they say the name of the film in the film
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04Do the books explain how Saruman came to be corrupted by Sauron?
<AJIsAwesome> Stop murdering Fluttershy's family!
<Michael> burn all the things!
<AttacktheAndalite> Combustiblelemons: Okay then
<Sergio_Scriptor> Count-Bleck: not today unfortunately :'(
<Combustiblelemons> no problems
<otakon> Ghost_of_Gandalf: not really
<AJIsAwesome> Lil_B: :D
<OohShiny> eww
<TheMaster> Ghostie. Saruman wasn't corrupted by Sauron.
<Lil_B> Ghost_of_Gandalf money, might and virgins
<SirGanjalfTheGreen> New Born Orkies

<Sergio_Scriptor> That is still disgusting
<TheMaster> he was jealous of Gandalf
<RaveBrony> ._.
<Gimli> 1,11Agreed, Sergio.

<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Ghost_of_Gandalf pretty much
<Sundaysmile> oh hey! it's john candy!
<otakon> YES
<Michael> fangorn!
<TheMaster> back when the Istari (wizard angels that saruman, radaghast, ghandalf and 2 others) came to middle earth from valar Saruman was jealous of Gandalf.
<OohShiny> now I'm disgusted
<otakon> WILD DUNELINGS!

<Gimli> 1,11Sadist.
<Meanwhile> Nice teeth.
<Michael> saruman is amused
<eyesfire2> well i'm out.......thanks for the great time guys.......cya next time...........
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15The men of the East?
<otakon> sudden skippage?
<Rainbow-Crash> Ghost_of_Gandalf: I think that in the book, he believes that after he defeats gondor, he can become more powerful than Sauron, thus becoming just as bad as Sauron
<AttacktheAndalite> Bye eyesfire2
<otakon> Samwise_Gamgee: yh
<eyesfire2> wait did he say france

<PitViper> Oh god, this scene.
<Michael> bye eyesfire2

He was also impressed by the fact that Mortensen
<Gimli> 1,11continued acting even while so seriously injured. Mortensen later remarked that the only reason it was even mentioned on the DVD release was because he was an actor and that the stunt crew were injured far worse and pushed through it.

<SarumanOfManyColors> Combustiblelemons: that name should never be mentioned *shudders*
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Dead Marshes were actually a water-filled parking lot, the same one that had doubled up for outside the mines of Moria in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Passengers in passing trains on the adjacent railway line were able to see Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis performing on set.
<MLP_Brovakiin> froggy bottom bog

<ObLiCody> or whut
<PillowPoni> Gimli: That would be aesome. But where would it be held?
<Ghost_of_Gandalf> 04An idea had been tossed out once for a real life BMN where people would come in and watch an A movie and a B movie on a projector

<Cypresswolf> Again - a movie with just Gandalf vs The Balrog would be awesome! Imagine how long that fight lasted - from the deepest depths to the highest mountain peaks
<CriticKitten> No really. How did they fall into the depths of a mountain and land ON A MOUNTAIN?
<Azuredragon> He leveled up
<TheMaster> and now gandalf heads back to the undying lands to explain why he died
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Gandalf the Grey evolves into...Gandalf the White!

<otakon> Uncle Fluttershy
<Michael> flutterguy again
<otakon> TRIVIA!
<Cypresswolf> This movie series had some fantastic one take shots :)
<Meanwhile> Ent poety is almost as dull as Vogons...
<OohShiny> FLuttertree
<otakon> John Rhys Davies voices Treebeard
<Gimli> 1,11Dat poem
<Saigneur> fluttertree is best tree
<Combustiblelemons> Don't be hasty, not until i've seen those street fighters pummeled to dust...
<TrixieMuffin> Gandalf is one of the Mythrandir, i forget how many there were , Gandalf the grey , Saruman the white , radagast the brown , one was green and one blue but i forget the names
<Ninjazz> Ents, man.
<Azuredragon> http://ponybot.net/pix/2973.jpg
<Gimli> 1,11otakon: I gave that trivia earlier. :P
<otakon> dammit
<Gandalf_the_White> 04I figured Davies voiced Treebeard
<Barbetos> Meanwhile it sounds very similiar to Vogan poetry too.
<TheMaster> the other two istari left for the east right as soon as they got to middle earth
<pikorar> Boring ass tree.
<AJIsAwesome> Azuredragon: That's epic.
<Combustiblelemons> all out of trivia are we?
*SirGanjalfTheEmerald snores*
<Kencolt> Meanwhile: Vogon Poetry isn't dull at all. The vast majority of the galaxy wishes to hell it were.
*OohShiny is getting sleepy
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Frodo's thoughts: Man.... we could travel 12 mph faster than this guy....
<TheMaster> Radaghast, Saruman and Gandalf are the ones who were around at the start of the trilogy
<Barbetos> Great this just made me yawn
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> -wha-what?
<Gimli> 1,11AzureDragon: That reminds me of the animation from Fantasia 2000
<OohShiny> Fluttershy always make us sleep
<TheMaster> but Saruman fell to Sauron and Radaghast was hugging trees
<SarumanOfManyColors> I has a sad ;_;
<Gondor> TheMaster, what happened to Radaghast?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15so what happened to Radaghast?
<pikorar> C:
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Shirelings
<Nyst> I wonder if Ents see normal trees the way we see monkeys.
<Combustiblelemons> i wonder if they packed a towel before they went on their adventure to mordor
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Hush now, quiet now...
<Gandalf_the_White> 04"Sleep to morning light..." *sprinkles salt and black pepper over their toes*
<TheMaster> in the council of elrond (in the books) they discuss how they went to find Radaghast and say that he was gone but probably not killed/captured by the enemy
<beeep100> i cant wait for the tree to suddenly go on a rampage and kill them.
<Michael> call all the fluttertrees
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> D'aww, he's kinda like Fluttershy
<TheMaster> he was in woods inbetween rohan and gondor
<Sergio_Scriptor> Nyst: probably
<TheMaster> so he apparently just missed out on the action like Luna
<OohShiny> SirGanjalfTheEmerald he's fluttershy
<Gondor> so, what exactly is a brown wizard?
<cratorkid> TheMaster: and Gondor
<CriticKitten> Gandalf, speak up.
<Cypresswolf> The Ent Councel > Jedi Councel
<TheMaster> the wizards are like angels, they're not harry potter wizards
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> OohShiny: I like to think of him as Fluttershy's granddad:p
<Pinkies4thWall> Is this Fellowship or Two Towers?
<Gimli> 1,11Friend is asking me to take him to Best Buy to have his computer fixed. -_- How far are we into the movie?
<TheMaster> Gandalf = Sauron technically
<Michael> master of puppets!
<Fl00tersh41> Gondor: Does the word Scatomancy ring any bells?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> PinkiesthWall: Two Towers
<Sergio_Scriptor> Gimli: about 30 %
<Rohan> Gimli: not even a third
<TheMaster> they're both the same sort of beings. Minor gods in the general order of middle earth pantheons
<Sylandest> Gimli: a fair way in. but much more to go
<Pinkies4thWall> PinkiePieYoshi64: dat 4
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Aww geeez Dx
<NullRadix> Gimli: your friend needs a bike
<AJIsAwesome> Gimli: About a third.
<Mackmax3> dahell
<MisterBen> I can still barely here the movie, and I've got my volume at max.
<TheMaster> Sauron use to be a Lieutenant for a much more evil and powerful being called Morgoth.
<Combustiblelemons> LoTR is amazingly long but even so it misses out parts.
<MisterBen> All I can hear from Gandalf is mumblemumblemumble
<TheMaster> until Morgoth got his ass kicked
<AJIsAwesome> MisterBen: Speakers or headphones?
<Combustiblelemons> god knows how long it would be if it missed nothing.
<Sergio_Scriptor> MisterBen: you got to get Phonies :)
<MisterBen> AJIsAwesome: Speakers
<Gimli> 1,11I'll ask if he can wait until the break...
<Navy_Brony> the magic of friendship
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Morgoth is pretty much LotR's universe Satan, right?
<TheMaster> yes
<TheMaster> thats who tolkein based it on
<beeep100> gasp!
<AJIsAwesome> MisterBen: Ok. Do you have headphones?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> DUN DUN DUUUN
<Michael> the black gate!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I need headphones for thism my computer speakers don't show anything D:
<Fl00tersh41> TheMaster: Morgoth was the dude who created the drakons and Balrogs for his armies
<Rayne> Ba doop!
<MisterBen> AJIsAwesome: I do. I might try that.
<Fl00tersh41> *dragons
<Pinkies4thWall> Who be streaming tis?
<TheMaster> Morgoth didn't create anything. He couldn't
<TheMaster> he just corrupted
<Pinkies4thWall> *this

<OohShiny> I need headphones to understand english
<Rohan> Dumblewhore: could you up the volume just a tad?
<Rayne> I DID
<OohShiny> not my native languagwe
<Combustiblelemons> they did indeed
<Kandarihu> Gimli, I hear bad things about Geek Squad.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04The setting is at its highest, Rohan
<TheMaster> Tolkein was very specific that Morgoth couldn't create anything. Only Eru can create (the god of LOTR)
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Sorry
<PinkiePieYoshi64> MARCH, MARCh, MARCH, MARCH
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Men of the East
<killerpony7733> TheMaster: Didn't Morgoth the one to corrupt or turn sauron evil?
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: haha :D
<Rayne> oooooooooooooo
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
<Michael> trolls!
<Cypresswolf> One does not simply storm the gates of Mordor
<Sergio_Scriptor> dem castle walls
<cratorkid> BRUMAK
<killerpony7733> TheMaster: wasn't*
<cratorkid> lol
<TheMaster> Morgoth only rhymed his own tune unlike the other gods who rhymed to help shape elves and dwarves.
<Rohan> Gandalf_the_White: ah well thats ok then :)
<OohShiny> dem trolls
<beeep100> big scary things.
<Michael> dont feed the trolls!
<Sergio_Scriptor> my chat is derping
<CriticKitten> Gimli: Ask your friend to find a better computer store. Geek Squad overcharges for every service they do, and don't always do it as well.
<Kandarihu> TrololololOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLLLLLLLLOL!
<TheMaster> yes. Morgoth corrupted many minor gods. All the balrogs are the same sort of thing as Sauron
<Rayne> I saw that
<MisterBen> Ok. Headphones on. That's better.
<NullRadix> Rohan: check your stream volume, your computer volume, and see if your speakers/headphones can adjust volume
<TheMaster> Morgoth also corrupted elves to create orcs
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat fail
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> fail
<Azuredragon> Trolls "We're being opressed!"
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Gollum's in his happy place...

<Dumblewhore> I still don't get this bit
<MLP_Brovakiin> thats one way down
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when stupid fat hobbit almost gave them away?
<Nyst> Human eyes?
<Dumblewhore> How can they be sliding down the cliff
<MisterBen> Yeah. Headphones make a significant improvement.
<Rohan> NullRadix: all at max, but on a laptop
<TheMaster> I think those are Harradrim not easterlings
<Gondor> TheMaster, so Gandalf = Sauron = Balrogs?
<Dumblewhore> And yet the two guards don't see anything
<PinkiePieYoshi64> You've been spotted... disengaged... repeat... disengage!!!
<TheMaster> yes. basically they're all the same thing
<Dumblewhore> They're not hiding till they get to the bottom
<pikoRing> I am now pikoRing!
<Nyst> Are those human guards?
<Sergio_Scriptor> Dumblewhore: it's magic :)
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> A ROCK?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15TheMaster is their a difference?
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Stealth Rock
<MysteryGuitarDash> :D
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> That's my disguise?
<Rayne> Thats my destiny!?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15there*
<Cypresswolf> and not a single lookout spotted them sliding down the cliff! Like a Boss
<Agrold> sneaking +100
<PinkiePieYoshi64> All I see is a rock...
<Kencolt> Elven Cloaks.
<Combustiblelemons> Huh? what was thay noise!
<Navy_Brony> Good thing I didn't iron this!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> A ROCK
<Michael> dat stealth
<Rayne> seems legit
<TheMaster> Well they all look different. As minor gods they get to decide their appearance
<Combustiblelemons> A box?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> That rock is a SPAH
<PinkiePieYoshi64> A ROCK, IS MY DESTINY?!?!
<beeep100> *atchoo*
<Rohan> Dumblewhore: they did eat enough carrots

<PinkiePieYoshi64> DUMB ROCK
<Gimli> 1,11SNEAK raised to 25.
<Nyst> I don't get it. You never see those kind of troops in the entire movie.
<Combustiblelemons> snake would be proid.
<Rohan> ddint*
<TheMaster> Balrogs look like they do because of their corruption
<Combustiblelemons> proud*
<Fl00tersh41> TheMaster: According to the LotR Wiki morgoth created the dragons
<Combustiblelemons> derp.
<Pinkies4thWall> They should put that as as camo in Modern Warfare 3
<Sergio_Scriptor> i do not speak elvic :P
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Nyst: They are in books though
<Pinkies4thWall> *as a
<OohShiny> so Cockatrice turned them to rock
<Nyst> It's orcs and goblins and uruk'hai, and yet this scene has those different unnamed troops.
<TheMaster> Sauron use to be able to disguise himself. Thats how he tricked the elves into making the rings
<Gimli> 1,11BUFF-FFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!
<pikoRing> That's at LEAST Sneak 50.
<OohShiny> Masterrr
<Michael> gollum knows...
<Fl00tersh41> TheMaster: The balrogs where corrupted Maia spirits so I'll grant you that one
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Smeagle pulls Sam and Frodo to keep them from going into the gate, Andy Serkis accidentally pulled so hard that it yanked the wig off of Sean Astin(Sam)'s head. Sean angrily stormed off the set to have the wig put back on.
<Nyst> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: do you know what they're called? Are they human?
<AlienWarhead> Gimli The ring of buffering
<IshBestPony> ohai regulars

<AlienWarhead> That Golium guy seems trustwortly>_>
<PinkiePieYoshi64> well Smeagle... thanks for extending the moive another 50 mins when you could have showed them the better way xD
<TheMaster> Sauron tricked them by tricking the men of Numenor into attacking the easterlings.
<AJIsAwesome> Seems legit.
<pikoRing> He is the element of Honesty!
<TheMaster> so that the easterlings would be loyal to him
<Dark_Horst> guys, please... his name is smeagol. not smeagle
<Gimli> 1,11Aparently the wig incident happend the very day after Sean's accident with the glass shard in the river.

<Meanwhile> Saruman.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Extended Version reveals that Aragorn is 87 years old. This is said to be due to the fact that he is a descendant of the Dunedain, gifted with long life. (Readers of the book knew this already.)
<fluttershyFTW> so whicj one is this
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15wuuuuut
<Gandalf_the_White> 04What race is Gandalf exactly?
<TheMaster> yup. Aragon is old
<Meanwhile> Bring his whores.
<OohShiny> Barbetos Pinkie Pie smells like cupcakes
<TheMaster> Gandalf is an angel
<TheMaster> he's a minor god
<CriticKitten> Dayum. He looks good for 87.
<AJIsAwesome> Meanwhile: :D
<TheMaster> Saruman and Gandalf are not humans
<PinkiePieYoshi64> We WILL

<SarumanOfManyColors> Gandalf's a Majar I believe. I don't remember the race exactly

<fluttershyFTW> oooo shiny
<Gimli> 1,11She looked pissed.
<OohShiny> aragorn is human?
<Combustiblelemons> O_O
<TheMaster> Aragon is descended from the men of Numenor. He's technically related to Elrond
<SarumanOfManyColors> Haven't read the Silmarilion in a while
<CriticKitten> She mad
<fluttershyFTW> u mad
<MisterBen> "You have some skill with a blade?" SHING! "I'll take that as a yes."
<Rohan> WATCH OUT WE GOT A BADASS OVER HERE
<Nyst> If I recall the book had a less empowered view on women no?
<Fl00tersh41> If the women of Rohan learned this long ago, then why are none of them ever fighting?
<cratorkid> OohShiny: no , dumedian , i think thats how its spelled
<AlienWarhead> Rohan we do
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> MisterBen: smooth
<Kencolt> Dunedain.
<TheMaster> A long long time ago Elrond had a brother who decided to be human. His descendents eventually founded Gondor
<CriticKitten> Fl00tersh41: Because chivalry and such
<pikoRing> Dat zoom in.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat move
<Kencolt> But there was a mark somewhere in there.
<cratorkid> Kencolt: thaat
<Michael> <3 the music
<CriticKitten> DIS THEME
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> farewell, Whiterun:(
<Fl00tersh41> CriticKitten: Even at helms deep not one woman will join the men fighting on the walls
<TheMaster> Tolkein wrote the books in the 40s
<fluttershyFTW> .....
<pwny> Dat stare
<Gimli> 1,11Interesting...
<Dumblewhore> Dat smile
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> creepy...
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Warg?
<Squallken> eww he raised his eyebrows when children was mentioned
<fluttershyFTW> is this the first one
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15is that what he said
<Cypresswolf> They will have women...and children - Saruman Gusta!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> diamond dogs
<CriticKitten> WARG
<TheMaster> it was a different time. Plus Tolkein was writing a original tribute too old scandanavian sagas and germanic stories. They did not include themes of female empowerment
<Meanwhile> Aye. Wargs.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Oh yeah
<Gandalf_the_White> 04This part
<Rohan> Samwise_Gamgee: yea
<OohShiny> we'll kill your men and steal your women!

<beeep100> blub blub
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Andy said the water was so cold he almost got hypothermia
<Michael> goo gollum :D
<Meanwhile> Because. Duh.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: For one shot where Gollum is crawling and splashing down a river after a fish, Andy Serkis was actually in the water. It had been snowing the previous night, and the snow had melted, but the water was still freezing cold. Peter Jackson was worried that Serkis would forget about the cliff due to the cold and would fall off so he put two crew members near the edge
<Gimli> 1,11to stop him in the event that he got too close.
<Ryunosuke> Worgs are ... not unlike Dire Wolves, but more vicious
<Fl00tersh41> TheMaster: Shield maidens, Valkyries and such
<CriticKitten> Because he's evil, Frodo, you fucking moron
<MLP_Brovakiin> He is having a whale of a time :D
<Fl00tersh41> Norse women fought plenty often
<MisterBen> And Smeagol is able to swim in water not even a foot deep
<Combustiblelemons> damn that is some dedication
<AlienWarhead> He is so cute that's why
<PinkiePieYoshi64> He's full of evil.... like your father......
<Squallken> NOTHING
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> WATCH YOUR WORDS, BOI
<TheMaster> Yes, but Lord of the Rings is more Beowulf then Nibirngun (or however its spelled)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> giant hyenas
<Riders> Mr. Frodo, you're yelling at me
<CriticKitten> Sam has more intelligence than you, Frodo. >_>
<pikoRing> The ring makes him a nice guy?
<Navy_Brony> It's because you're bi-polar, Mr. Frodo.
<TheMaster> Beowulf has...very few women
<OohShiny> the ring is a horcrux
<fluttershyFTW> frodo is mad
<MDL> sam is the real hero of the story.
<Sergio_Scriptor> pikoRing: of course :)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> yes
<Fl00tersh41> TheMaster: Beowulf had to fight grendels mother too
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> F

<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Fl00tersh41 and a dragon
<PinkiePieYoshi64> MIIIIIIIIINNNNNNEEEEEEEEEE
<PinkiePieYoshi64> ;)
<TheMaster> Grendels mother isn't exactly a heroic role
<fluttershyFTW> MIIIIIIIIIINNNNNEEE
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Congratulation Frodo, you're the new Gollum
<pikoRing> :C
<TheMaster> plus she doesn't even have a name
<Sergio_Scriptor> Meanwhile: i thought he was the element of Meat shield :\
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Good camera tricks here
<pikoRing> NO YODA! DON'T DO IT!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis was pitched the role of Gollum by his agent, who rang him up and asked him if he wanted to do three weeks' voiceover work in New Zealand. However, Peter Jackson was so blown away by Serkis' audition that he decided to have him perform the movements for Gollum as well.
<Gondor> Fl00tersh41, that was a mom, it's different

<Gondor> dat wall
<Meanwhile> Link wall.

<Fl00tersh41> Samwise_Gamgee: The dragon wasn't related to Grendel in any way, contrary to what that movie showed
<MisterBen> ...dat link
<Ninjazz> DAT WALL LINK.
<Sergio_Scriptor> epic scene
<Combustiblelemons> oops.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15derpy.me.....use it

<Combustiblelemons> sorry >.<<
<CriticKitten> NOBODY LIKES YOU

<TheMaster> The dragon was way later though in beowulf
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> breaking 4th wall, like a Smeagol
<pikoRing> Please, just use full image.
<MisterBen> NOT LISTENING LA LA LA LA
<OohShiny> Gollum is Tardy
<TheMaster> when beowulf was old.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I never understood this scnee....
<Combustiblelemons> did not think that link would be wall-o-text
<PinkiePieYoshi64> until now...
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Fl00tersh41 I know I read the poem. STill, it's awesome
<otakon> SNAP OUT OF IT!
<Algol> how far away is the battle for Helm's Deep?
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis said that he based Gollum's voice on the sound of a cat coughing up a hairball.
<otakon> where is Spike when you need him?
<pikoRing> :'C
<Meanwhile> Who're you.
<TheMaster> Golum has been warped by the ring. Smeagol is the original thing that gollum once was
<CriticKitten> Gimli: Sounds....about right
<pikoRing> Poor Smeagol.
<TheMaster> so he's a little crazy
<Michael> ME!
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> PinkiePieYoshi64: Gollum clearly has a split personality disorder
<Algol> Just a guy who plays the sax.
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Gollum's pupils signal his frame of mind. "Treacherous Gollum" has narrow pupils; "friendly Gollum" has slightly wider pupils. This is most obvious in the scene when the two sides of his personality struggle with each other.
<Algol> Err...used to.
<Meanwhile> Oh hey Alex.
<Algol> Oh hai =P
<Colt_45> Poor smeagol
<Algol> Just popping in before I get my hair cut
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> TheMaster: "Little" is an understatement:P
<CriticKitten> ....I see it. That's really clever
<Meanwhile> As for how far Helms Deep is...a while, I think.
<PillowPoni> NEVER COME BAC!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> SirGanjalfTheEmerald: I know, it's because the last time I've seen these movies were like 5 years ago- and by thta time I didn't know any better to understand
<Michael> smeagol compels you!
<Meanwhile> They haven't met the worg yet.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15yeah...quite a while
<otakon> and then he was alone
<Rohan> Gimli: also looks like theres abit of a color differance too
<Algol> Got it
<otakon> YAY!
<pikoRing> Yay! Smeagol!
<OohShiny> he got better!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: A new technique for creating realistic translucent materials was developed for the creation of Gollum. The so-called technique called "subsurface scattering", allowed the 3D-artists at Weta Digital, to simulate light casting into objects and bouncing around underneath the surface and casted back out again. This has been used ever since in the vfx production to
<Gimli> 1,11create realistic skin.
<Algol> unfortunately, I have to go to a BBQ after haircut ;___;
<Michael> free
<fluttershyFTW> the good gollum's name is smeagol
<killerpony7733> Smeagol is fre!!!
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> yay:)
<Dumblewhore> Giant weta
<Michael> ohai angel
<Algol> gonna miss one of my favorite battle scenes in a movie ever
<Combustiblelemons> Smeagol needs a sock!
<otakon> oh look, a bunny
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Smeagol is free from being Two face....
<TheMaster> gollums original name is smeagol
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis' hobby of rock-climbing came in very handy for his mainly on-all-fours performance as Gollum.
<Algol> also, who opped me? o_o
<otakon> ANgel FINALLY got what he deserved
<fluttershyFTW> YEAH SMEAGOL IS FREE
<Michael> eat angel :p
<Sergio_Scriptor> HEUUUGH d:
<Meanwhile> Still, think of the barbeque.
<JESmith71> Oh good he klled Angel
<Meanwhile> Tom did.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Congratulations: Your Gollum has evolved into Smeagol
<Sergio_Scriptor> JESmith71: thank god
<otakon> nom nom nom
<Riders> At the risk of sounding cliche, Gollum may be one of the most tortured characters in fiction
<AJIsAwesome> ANGEL, NO!!!!!!!

<PinkiePieYoshi64> WHY!!!!!!
<Sergio_Scriptor> YOU RUINED IT
<pwny> lol
<fluttershyFTW> ewwww
<Algol> didn't think it'd do that...
<Michael> this is delicious!
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When Gollum spits in disgust at Sam's cooking of rabbits, that is Andy Serkis' very own spittle flying through the air. Serkis lists that scene as his favorite from all three films.
<CriticKitten> STUPID FAT HOBBIT
<Kandarihu> Here it is.
<otakon> stupid fat hobbit!
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> You don't cook Angel! (Just eat him raw)

<trackerzod> yay black sheep :3
<pikoRing> Don't provoke my hunger! That rabbit stew looks good enough.
<Meanwhile> Wrrrrrriggling.
<Kencolt> Gollum appreciates Sashimi.
<Kandarihu> When this movie was new, I heard a hiphop mix of this on YTMND
<MisterBen> Wrrrrrrrringling!
<TheMaster> Smeagol isn't quitea hobbit
<beeep100> raaar
<fluttershyFTW> yup he is a hobbit
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15I've never had rabbit
<TheMaster> he's more like a ancestor to hobbits. Smeagol is 500 years old
<Gimli> 1,11Huh...That was an almost-civil conversation between those two...
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Smeagol was a hobbit
<Combustiblelemons> rabbit is pretty good actually
<beeep100> dink.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> He used to be a Hobbit... But then he took-NAH
<Meanwhile> Samwise_Gamgee: It's alright, but not very filling.
<Algol> usually use this nick with the lightIRC embed if I want to check up on chat and I don't have much time to be on it
<Navy_Brony> I've had rabbit. It's not bad, but lacks many nutrients.
<fluttershyFTW> then the ring turned him into gollum
<Combustiblelemons> i don't like rabbits so i can eat them.
<CriticKitten> Evil men!
<Ninjazz> I remember when that was on Albino BLack sheep.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Mr. Frodo... the Ding has landed....
<pikoRing> Ninjas!
<Rohan> Gandalf_the_White: not exactly but close
<Meanwhile> Fair enough.
<cratorkid> TheMaster: are people from 500 years ago not human?
<fluttershyFTW> :O
<pwny> Im getting tired sitting here
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> Middle easterners
<AJIsAwesome> To be honest, I've always wanted to try rabbit
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Andy Serkis drank bottles and bottles of "Gollum juice" (a mixture of honey, lemon and ginger) to keep his throat lubricated for his intense vocal performance.
<fluttershyFTW> the easterlings
<pikoRing> pwny: Then.... Sit somewhere else.
<beeep100> raaaaaar
<TheMaster> Gollum was actually a stoor. A pre-sort of hobbit
<Fl00tersh41> Just because they're easterlings don't mean they're evil. Smeagle's just racist
<Gimli> 1,11The fuck was up with these actors and their strange drinks?
<CriticKitten> OLIPHANT
<OohShiny> dat's a big elephant
<PinkiePieYoshi64> I't s a giraffe!!! ;D :D

<pikoRing> Gimil: I had to drink that for a sore throat.

<Rohan> Gimli: dedication at its finest
<AJIsAwesome> DAHAHAHAHAHA! IT"S A GIRAFFE!

<Gandalf_the_White> 04Faramir, best human character in the series IMO
<fluttershyFTW> FIRE
<CriticKitten> Faramir doesn't do anything "like" a boss, he is one.
<Nyst> I do not remember that scene
<fluttershyFTW> ouch
<Combustiblelemons> xD fail
<MisterBen> "You know when I said we were in too deep?" "Yeah?" "We're in too deep."
<Michael> gotcha!
<Fl00tersh41> Gandalf_the_White: Faramit is awesome, but not as awesome as boromir
<CriticKitten> You failed your ambush check
<TheMaster> Faramir will never be as cool as his brother
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> It's Robin, and his Merry Men!
<pikoRing> Robin Hood!

<CriticKitten> Gimli for best horse rider
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Combustiblelemons there are a lot of Russian women in my town...and most of them are really hot
<RaveBrony> :D
<Algol> ...mfw someone hijacked Daniel Ingram's twitter
<fluttershyFTW> ow
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Between takes, Brad Dourif (wormtongue) stayed in character by continuing to speak with an English accent until all his footage had been completed. This was so convincing that, at the end, when he spoke with his normal voice again, Bernard Hill thought that his English accent was real and that his American accent must be fake.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Women with beards, yep Gimli, it's pretty ridiculous:p
<Kandarihu> Oh, the rumors that Gimli explained sound more like the Uruk Hai
<Dumblewhore> Pfft
<Combustiblelemons> I went to russia once- st petersburg. Most of the women had a boyish look to them.
<Dumblewhore> His English accent sucks

<Riders> Bob Barker, eat your heart out
<Algol> and I'm off
<pikoRing> So... How long will he live?
<TheMaster> Aragon is descended from a long-lived, powerful group of men who are partially decended from elves.
<Dumblewhore> Not long after that stew
<PitViper> Elven blood it does a lifespan good.
<Algol> later folks enjoy the movie
<Gimli> 1,11"bitch can't cook worth shit"
<Dumblewhore> Food poisoning
<Dumblewhore> ded
<NullRadix> Riders: :D
<Ninjazz> Cya, Algol. Take care.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Suddenly, she lost all the hots
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15later
<Meanwhile> Seeya Saxy. Enjoy the BBQ.
<Legolas> lol was this guy it seems https://twitter.com/orchetect
<TheMaster> remember Elrond? Aragon is Elronds Nephew
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Whaaaaat
<Kencolt> Beautiful, Brave, Skilled at Battle-- and cooks like Akane Tendo.
<AlienWarhead> Is he a half elf?
<OohShiny> too much buffers
<Gandalf_the_White> 04I thought Arwen was a direct descendent of Elrond?
<Michael> brb
<Dark_Horst> TheMaster: saywuuuuuut?
<Barbetos> Corn cob pipe and the finest tabacie!
<Gondor> TheMaster, oh my GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
<TheMaster> Elf is more of a status then a race.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15a fellow musician eh?
<pikoRing> I am asleep. Self explanatory.
<OohShiny> go to sleep
<Rohan> kkissing cousins
<OohShiny> lol
<Legolas> yep
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The role of Eowyn, the White Lady of Rohan, was first offered to Irish actress Alison Doody in December 1999, who had to decline the part because she had just given birth to her second daughter. Miranda Otto then auditioned for the same role.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> like Native American
<TheMaster> you can stop being an elf. Arwen is actually Aragons distant cousin
<SarumanOfManyColors> Technically, that means Arogorn is related to Elrond, and so he is related to Eowyn. 0.0
<OohShiny> he's gonna wake up
<TheMaster> Elrond had a brother who decided to be human instead of elf
<Gandalf_the_White> 04My word
<fluttershyFTW> awwww
<TheMaster> and thats arwen. Eowyn is theodens daughter
<PinkiePieYoshi64> If you sleep in a dream... then....
<Rohan> yay i'm part of trivia
<PitViper> Yes, they're cousins about 20 generations removed.
<SarumanOfManyColors> TheMaster: this
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> PinkiePieYoshi64: http://inception.davepedu.com/
<Rohan> TheMaster: Elros?
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Ah, so whatever blood they share is extremely thin
<Combustiblelemons> dat inception button.;
<pikoRing> PinkiePieYoshi64: If you sleep in a dream, you sleep for real!
<OohShiny> wut?
<OohShiny> wut she say?
<TheMaster> Elves are immortal afterall.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> lol
<Gandalf_the_White> 04No subtitles are on ><
<Dumblewhore> Why is there no incestion button
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15dat top
<TheMaster> But Arwen and Aragon are the reunion of that bloodline
<Ryunosuke> pointy... ears
<otakon> Dumblewhore: inception you mean right?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> sideboob
<Combustiblelemons> Dumblewhore because you haven't made one yet.
<otakon> damn
<TheMaster> you know, tolkein never said that elves had pointy ears
<Dumblewhore> otakon: No, incestion. :P
<CriticKitten> Wow.
<OohShiny> dayum
<otakon> mAGNIFICENT SIDE BOBO!
<TheMaster> that was only a thing later.
<OohShiny> Sexy time
<otakon> Dumblewhore: they AREN'T RELATED
<Michael> back
<otakon> brb
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> He's still a human. And she's still and elf. Incest nautralized.
<Dark_Horst> ...that'S almost as much of a brickshitter moment as the day i relized simba had kids with his cousin
<fluttershyFTW> smexy moment
<Combustiblelemons> well the stereotype for elves is pointy ears
<CriticKitten> She looks....downright gorgeous in that outfit, too.
<pikoRing> TheMaster: Yeah, but they're obligatory pointy ears.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> *neutralized
<PitViper> I could have sworn it was mentioned in one of the appendices.
<Michael> kiss time <3
<OohShiny> Awake
<TheMaster> you couldn't tell the difference if they didn't have pointy ears
<derpy56> WHAT IS THIS MOVIE
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> it was a memory not a dream
<Gimli> 1,11How long until intermission?
<Michael> derpy56: LOTR: two towers
<fluttershyFTW> nice transition
<derpy56> LOL caps
<TheMaster> Its the Two Towers
<AJIsAwesome> derpy56: Lord of the Rings; The Two Towers.
<Sergio_Scriptor> Gimli: you are the mod,and you are askings us ? :D
<derpy56> thank you
<Gimli> 1,11That was meant for the other mods.
<TheMaster> Heres the backstory explaining Aragon and his holdups about claiming his birthright
<Sergio_Scriptor> Gimli: but still... :)
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I say intermission after Aragorn dies...
<Kandarihu> Gimli, I'd think that the technical difficulties would account for all the intermission we need.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> dat elvish
<OohShiny> Flashback time
<Rohan> Gimli: asking Dumblewhore directly would work
<LunarGearlord> two tower ception
<PinkiePieYoshi64> We still have to go through an intermisison?!?!?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Subs, pls
<Michael> yes
<PinkiePieYoshi64> HOW LONG IS THIS FILM?!!?
<pikoRing> SeaponiesofLiverpool: REALLY!? SPOILER!?

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> :(
<Sergio_Scriptor> PinkiePieYoshi64: about 4 hours
<Barbetos> Very VERY long
<TheMaster> ever seen the books? they last forever
<Kencolt> PinkiePieYoshi64: Very.
<OohShiny> PinkiePieYoshi64 4 hours
<CriticKitten> Where the heck are the subtitles then'? ._.
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> ever read Fallout: Equestria?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dang, I don't remember it being THAT long....
<Combustiblelemons> Y U SAY THIS?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> that's longer the LOTR books
<AJIsAwesome> We're about halfway in, right?
<SarumanOfManyColors> PinkiePieYoshi64: this is the extended edition
<OohShiny> PinkiePieYoshi64 extended version
<Combustiblelemons> it feels longer than 4 hours.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> ah ok D:
<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: we are about at 53 % now
<fluttershyFTW> is this fellow ship of ring or the two towers
<TheMaster> As Tolkein said. "the tale grew in the telling"
<Mackmax3> two towers
<Combustiblelemons> ._. mother of god
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Two Towers
<Buytoast> this is the return of the towers of fellowship

<fluttershyFTW> :'(
<Riders> How old is Galadriel?
<Rosfox> hai chrome
<Kandarihu> Is that Chrome or Iron?
<TheMaster> Galadriel is ancient
<Dumblewhore> Shh
<Dumblewhore> :P
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Hai Chrome, I'm using your for stream :D
<Combustiblelemons> First time watching the two towers i fell asleep at this point.
<eosforos> hey eveypony
<Riders> Just curious
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> The King of the Fellowship of Two Towers
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> galadriel is as old as Sauron
<Michael> hai eosforors
<CriticKitten> Legolas is best scout
<pikoRing> Hi eosforos! I love you!
<TheMaster> heres a good way of putting it. Galadriel is older then the sun
<Rinshin> :O
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Hai esforors
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> WARGS
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15WARGS
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> VERY very very very ikd
<AJIsAwesome> eosforos: Hi!:)
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Warg attack against the Rohirrim was originally supposed to be set at night, and at Edoras. After working on the Edoras set during the day, Peter Jacksondecided that it was too windy and too cold to bring cast and crew back for a night scene, so the scene was re-written to happen during daylight.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Uh oh....
<Canadian_Brony> Hello everyponyl. Two Towers?
<Michael> wargs!
<fluttershyFTW> somethings bad gonna gappen
<Michael> hai Canadian_Brony
<MisterBen> ded
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> dire hyena
<OohShiny> cuteee
<MisterBen> wait no
<eosforos> pikoRing: :)
<Sergio_Scriptor> hi Canadian_Brony :) and yes
<OohShiny> don't kill the diamond dogs
<fluttershyFTW> :O
<TheMaster> Galadriel was there when a giant spider ate the tree that kept the world in eternal twilight. The remains of that tree became the sun and the moon
<TheMaster> thats how old Galadriel is
<fluttershyFTW> DANG
<AlienWarhead> Hi it is Two Towers
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: Hi!:)
<fluttershyFTW> that has to heart
<Combustiblelemons> That scout is a spy!
<Michael> Canadian_Brony: are you from a blog?
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Although Wargs in the novel are described merely as looking like wolves, the filmmakers decided to add in elements of hyenas (which are not members of the wolf/dog family) to their build, to create a uniquely fearsome appearance.
<TheMaster> she's one of the oldest beings in middle earth
<OohShiny> they've killed the Diamond Dogs. Those bastards!
<LunarGearlord> Dat epic music!
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15What about Tom Bombadil?
<TheMaster> Tom Bomadil is...probably god
<Azuredragon> my stream is a slide show...
<fluttershyFTW> :[ KILL THE BASTERDS
<TheMaster> Tolkein wasn't clear
<Canadian_Brony> Michael . . . no. I'm from Canada.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Legolas is like: TARGET: ACQUIRED
<Combustiblelemons> Wolves are scarier than hyenas imo
<PitViper> Either god or the personification of Middle Earth as a whole.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Suddenly this reminds me of the mountain figh scene in Mulan...
<PitViper> Probably
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> isn't that the same thing?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Tom Bombadil is Tom Bombadil:P
<TheMaster> Tom Bombadil is the only thing uncorrupted by the ring. and tolkein said no being of middle earth couldn't be corrupted.
<Michael> Canadian_Brony: i mean do u write something in a page named screwattack?
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Legolas uses Premptive Strike! It is super effective!
<TheMaster> So he's probably Eru
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> God = the Universe as a whole
<Nyst> Wargs? Huh, now I know where World of Warcraft got it's worgs from.
<OohShiny> this is reminding me of Narnia, the war at the end of the first movie
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> laggg
<Gimli> 1,11Dat elf-jump...
<MDL> epic mounting skills
<LunarGearlord> Music reminds me of dragon age
<TheMaster> Elves have 20 dexterity
<Cypresswolf> HAX!
<CriticKitten> Wolves have a very different build, though, and almost a graceful appearance in some cases. Adding a touch of hyena works here because it really does make them seem beastly and brutish
<fluttershyFTW> dang legolas has skills
<Aragorn> 11,01Arrow spam!
<Nyst> Light as a feather he is
<pikoRing> Horses VS. Wargs.

<AJIsAwesome> ShadowQuill: Cool! What is it?
*fluttershyFTW hugs araagorn
<CriticKitten> Samwise_Gamgee: It's fine when you can ensure the enemy will not breach your defenses, and assuming you have a way out. But that's not how this is set up.
<fluttershyFTW> O.O
<Kandarihu> I have to turn them all the way up to hear what's going on.
<Combustiblelemons> lord of the surprised face.

<AJIsAwesome> Kandarihu: Try using headphones.
<sallymeow1> she looks tired
<Sergio_Scriptor> dat drain
<beeep100> i smell huge fighting scene...
<Colt_45> the problem with turtling in a castle is food. In the medieval ages, it was a tactic to starve the enemy out.
<otakon> Riders: yes
<pikoRing> sharklion: You could say he's.... HEAVYILY ARMED!
<otakon> idiot
<sharklion> our only weakness is this hole we dug into the wall. might as well give them a fair chance
<TheMaster> have no fear. there is plenty of movie left to go
<Barbetos> Kandarihu the movie is really quiet actually. I tried using my speakers, but went back to using my head phones.
<AJIsAwesome> ShadowQuill: Me neither. I usually make comments on videos.

<Dumblewhore> Legolas: That reminds me of those bird things
<Sergio_Scriptor> "THEY WILL FEAR THE MIGHTY OF ROME"
<LunarGearlord> *Takes off 7 pairs of glasses*Bloody hell...
<MLP_Brovakiin> I thought he was a good guy?

<Dumblewhore> You add water and they grow
<TheMaster> Grima is having some second thoughts it seems

<pikoRing> Colt_45: GIVE IT A LICK!
<Dark92Enigma> Remember kids..........FRIENDSHIP ALWAYS SAVE THE DAY!

<Sergio_Scriptor> Fl00tersh41: what took you so long ? :D
<TheMaster> Arwen is probably several hundred/thousnad years old
<Colt_45> I heard Agent Smith there made a lot of money that year. Being in the matrix and LoTR..
<TheMaster> as are pretty much all elves
<Fl00tersh41> Been here since Gandalf the white showed up
<OohShiny> TheMaster he's 87
<OohShiny> ooops
<TheMaster> Arwen, not aragon
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Samwise: Because it's night, and walls in Rivendell are paper-thin
<eosforos> that is wrong
<OohShiny> read aragon
<OohShiny> sorry
<ShadowQuill> I AM OFF TO WATCH PONIES
<eosforos> arwen is pretty young

<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Sexy Cry
<Ryunosuke> just saying
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15ONLY ONE TEAR ALLOWED
<CriticKitten> Uh. No she won't? I thought it was made clear that elves could give up their immortality. Can't she just....ya know, do that after he dies?
<Dumblewhore> She is 3500 years old? That cradle snatcher!
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> *Sexy Cry Time*
<Fl00tersh41> Sergio_Scriptor: I and my pirate ancestors deeply resent that comparison!
<beeep100> :(
<Sergio_Scriptor> Fl00tersh41: well then i will say this only now :"Welcome " :)
<eosforos> but she didnt in order to stay with aragorn
<Dumblewhore> Going after a poor young 87 year old
<otakon> Ryunosuke: they live a long time, they mature at teh same rate as a human
<TheMaster> Arwen gave up her shot at immortality
<eosforos> not 25 250
<fluttershyFTW> im not crying im sweating through myeyes

<fluttershyFTW> DONT DO IT
<Dumblewhore> If elves live forever there are no elf years
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: "You, your mate and your johnson,"
<TheMaster> Elrond stays to watch the war
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> This music reminds of Night Elves from WoW
<Combustiblelemons> FUCK YEAH SPARKLE SPARKLE SPARKLE!
<otakon> XD
<Sergio_Scriptor> Fl00tersh41: :D true...
<Ninjazz> Unless you kill them first, then there are elf years!
<Ryunosuke> wait, if arwen is 3500, that would mean that elrond is at least 4000, possibly as old as .... OVER 9000
<Fl00tersh41> The elves are rage quitting middle earth!
<Combustiblelemons> Hope you've seen his reading of 50 shades of grey. it's hilarous XD
<sharklion> damn french people
<sharklion> in LotR
<Dumblewhore> They probably barely realise time passes
<TheMaster> Well the elves had a lot of grief in middle earth
<OohShiny> Dumblewhore they say that elves live forever because normal people never seen elves dying from advanced age
<AJIsAwesome> Combustiblelemons: He read fifty shades of grey?!:D
<Fl00tersh41> They must be fed up with Saurons hax
<CriticKitten> In a stunning twist of fate, it turns out that the Undying Lands were actually Antartica. That's why there are no elves left.

<OohShiny> cratorkid because it's the protagonist power
<otakon> Buytoast: FUCK NO
<TheMaster> there really isn't such a thing as 'half elf' though.
<TheMaster> elf is more a status then a race
<pikoRing> Dumblewhore: He was the guy who did the Aflack duck too! :3
<Dark_Horst> sharklion: because the idea of fantasy is to imegine worlds that have perfect sutff in it. and men arent perfect. it's al in the comparison
<Buytoast> he has the voice of an angel
<otakon> okay, the HELL is "50 Shades of Grey"?

<Canadian_Brony> cratorkid O RLY

<eosforos> ok ty :P
<Buytoast> It's so difficult to know when it's a flashback.
<Dark92Enigma> *FLASHBACK*
<Kothen> I really like these flashbacks, as they show that Boromir was really a good man before the ring began to affect him.
<pikoRing> Looks like he was breaking 4th wall.
<Dark92Enigma> *RACCONTO*
<Fl00tersh41> Fartherly love at it's finest
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Boromir was a good man even before his death
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Well, to be fair, Boromir totally redeemed himself
<Meanwhile> Hey if Gondor surrenders what colour flag do they put up?
<Ninjazz> Something tells me he doesn't really like his other son.
<Dark92Enigma> Fluttershy flag
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15almost immediately after trying to hurt Frodo
<OohShiny> Boromir, Faramir... Their dad wasn't creative at all

<Navy_Brony> u mad bro?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Gollum's back bitches
<otakon> no
<PinkiePieYoshi64> AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<sharklion> RAAAAAAWR!
<fluttershyFTW> gollums back
<beeep100> raaaaar
<otakon> USE THE RING AND GET THE BUCK OUT OF THERE!
<TheMaster> using the ring is a bad idea
<PinkiePieYoshi64> otakon: But then the shadowbolts will come D:
<fluttershyFTW> dont do it
<TheMaster> it would draw every evil thing ever to him
<OohShiny> ring is a piece of shit... just makes you invisible
<otakon> Taking him where?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03lik dis if u laff evertim~
<otakon> TO DISNEYLAND!
<Buytoast> can't blame the dad for not liking farimir, he's an asshole
<TheMaster> it only turns hobbits invisible
<otakon> Scoot-Scootaloo: -___-
<Sergio_Scriptor> TheMaster: using rings is ALWAYS a bad idea :|
<sharklion> scumbag one ring
<fluttershyFTW> -_-
<otakon> TheMaster: turns everyone invisible actually
<TheMaster> beings powerful enough to wield the ring wouldn't turn invisible
<Tamazarashi> precious`
<beeep100> ze ring has taken you!
<TheMaster> sauron wasn't invisible
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> OohShiny: It's a powerful weapon, you just need to know how to use it
<AJIsAwesome> I don't get it. Why would every evil thing become drawn to you if you became invisible?
<Ninjazz> And no one ever liked this guy ever.
<TheMaster> and gandalf and galadriel wouldn't turn invisible
<fluttershyFTW> dont do it
<TheMaster> because the ring is alive
<otakon> AJIsAwesome: it's like lighting a beacon
<Canadian_Brony> in Soviet Middle Earth, ring puts on you to turn invisible
<TheMaster> the ring is basically saurons soul
<sharklion> TheMaster: Sauron wore mega armour
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Ok.
<OohShiny> SirGanjalfTheEmerald they didn't show any ring power actually
<Sergio_Scriptor> AJIsAwesome: magic :)
<otakon> brb need to check baking potatoes
<OohShiny> just invisibility
<CrimsonPhoenix> Wait....
<PinkiePieYoshi64> The ring.....
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Never saw LoTR before.
<PinkiePieYoshi64> it makes me sleep...
<Sergio_Scriptor> Haoaoaoao
<Dumblewhore> The ring always seems pretty useless
<fluttershyFTW> :s
<CrimsonPhoenix> in Xbox360
<fluttershyFTW> oh this wont end well
<CrimsonPhoenix> I have to pay, to use the marketplace?
<sharklion> did someone put that tape in with the static?
<Sergio_Scriptor> YOU DONT UNDERSTAND
<OohShiny> it's his precious
<Sergio_Scriptor> LEAVE MASTER FRODO ALONE
<TheMaster> The ring is alive, its saurons soul and only beings able to use it wouldn't turn invisible. Hobbits like to hide and not be noticed, thats why -they- turn invisible
<CrimsonPhoenix> I need gold membership to use the marketplace?
<MrBen> The Mountain....of DOOOOOOOOOOM!
<Dumblewhore> Turning invisible wouldn't help you destroy the world
<Canadian_Brony> One does not simply . . . oh who cares?
<MLP_Brovakiin> AJIsAwesome: niether have I
<TheMaster> no non-hobbits wear the ring so we don't know what they would do if they wore it
<Meanwhile> TheMaster: Isildur turned invisible in the flashback.
<fluttershyFTW> what happens when men wear it
<PinkiePieYoshi64> You want the Ring? Take it.... then a crazy fill will soon crawl out of your television... breaking your fourth wall... then all of the things you have become.... shall vanish....
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: I do......
<Michael> dat army
<sharklion> TheMaster: I see your point
<TheMaster> that would be the movie though, I don't recall that being mentioned in the book
<pony_9790> O_O
<beeep100> ze ring
<Combustiblelemons> They die in 7 days fluttershyFTW
<Canadian_Brony> AJIsAwesome then you finish it.
<TheMaster> and even if it did.isildur was trying to get away from a ambush at the time
<OohShiny> well, if I get the ring I would be what... I am a pacifist. Maybe I get iron skin or something.
<kidzrul434> I'd like a peanut butter and ice cream sandwich right now
<Sergio_Scriptor> fluttershyFTW: destruction happens
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> OohShiny: They don't really need too. Everyone probably realises how poweful it is. Think of it as a LotR version of Nuke. One random person couldn't do anything with it. In the right hands however...
<fluttershyFTW> -_- really
<Combustiblelemons> sorry couldn't help but make a the ring refeence.
<Combustiblelemons> 7 days....
<fluttershyFTW> :O the girl that comes out of the tv is actually the rings owner
<AJIsAwesome> Canadian_Brony: One does not simply look at that scene the same way again
<Sergio_Scriptor> fluttershyFTW: yep :P
<TheMaster> And Isildur was still a human. A minor god like saruman or gandalf could tap into the rings power just like sauron
<otakon> Good pony!
<OohShiny> The Ring?
<pikoRing> OohShiny: And then everyone around you would be like "Ooh, shiny!" Do you see what I did there?
<Michael> good horse :)
<Canadian_Brony> SirGanjalfTheEmerald no such thing as "In the right hands" for the ring
<OohShiny> pikoRing yes
<otakon> dat dwarf
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15So what do you think Gollum's allignment is. Chaotic Neutral?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> *gathers around*
<Riders> Gondor is no place for a pony
<otakon> Samwise_Gamgee: Neutral Evil
<fluttershyFTW> sauron is a
<fluttershyFTW> GIRL
<Legolas> he is alive! i'm gona kill him
<sharklion> okay.jpeg
<Ninjazz> Samwise_Gamgee, both evil and neutral.
<fluttershyFTW> whoa he sounded like a guy
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Canadian_Brony: Well Sauron's hands are "right hands" probably. From his point of view:P
<CriticKitten> XD
<magmablock> Has Helms Deep started yet? Or did I already miss it?
<otakon> Samwise_Gamgee: he looks out for himself for the most part, but willhurt/kill others to get what he needs/wants.
<fluttershyFTW> no
<TheMaster> helms deep is going to start soon
<cratorkid> magmablock: bot yet
<magmablock> great
<TheMaster> soon being relative
<fluttershyFTW> its almost here
<cratorkid> soon
<OohShiny> yay
<Combustiblelemons> O_O
<Michael> dat scene
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> like a baws
<Fl00tersh41> Samwise_Gamgee: chaotic evil, he doesn't care about others or rules of any kind, only what he wants
<Gandalf_the_Brony> LIKE A BOSS!

<PillowPoni> Gandalf_the_White: Here what comes

<PinkiePieYoshi64> OVER
<Michael> 10k...
<otakon> This bit is awesome
<PinkiePieYoshi64> 9,000!!!!!!! D:
<CriticKitten> LET THEM COME
<pikoRing> Sauron's eye is red and dry, maybe he'd be happier with Clear Eyes.
<sharklion> I think 10,000 could destroy the world of most things
<fluttershyFTW> :O
<Meanwhile> WHY WOULD YOU PING ME
<otakon> Every man and strong lad
<Riders> How long is the director's cut for Return of the King?
<AlienWarhead> What 9000!

<otakon> Dumblewhore: when the population is only 100K it's a big one

<CriticKitten> Very descriptive, Gimli.

<AlienWarhead> They are all elitle class with high level equipment
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Gimli knows
<CriticKitten> "THEY HAVE BIG ARMOR. THAT MAKES THEM BETTER THAN NORMAL ORCS."
<sharklion> are people pinging you meanwhile?
<Sergio_Scriptor> fluttershyFTW: :D indeed
<pikoRing> CriticKitten: That's what Legend of Zelda taught me.
<TheMaster> well saruman did enhance the urukhai
<otakon> CriticKitten: have you seen the armor of the typical Orc/Goblin? it's scraps
<somepony_else> allright... who's pinging Meanwhile?
<TheMaster> so they are sort of better then regular orcs
<Zawan> stop pinging him
<otakon> somepony_else: you
<OohShiny> too much buffers
<Dumori> IDKY but mt toast tastes like chocolate
<TheMaster> saruman used magic to enhance the urukhai. they're superior to mordor orcs but he has less of them

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> What is it good for?
<fluttershyFTW> if they want to go to war that is
<OohShiny> I thought Ents were pacifists....
<MrBen> Ganjalf: NOTHING!
<Navy_Brony> If they had flamethrowers back then, the ents would probably think twice.
<otakon> OohShiny: they are
<otakon> brb
<sharklion> Kandarihu: we call it Bronystate roulette
<Combustiblelemons> pacifists until their trees are being cut down
<Major> Samwise_Gamgee: Where was Gondor when ponies will die?

<TheMaster> Eowyn was one of my favorite characters
<Gondor> Where was I when I missed the Where was I scene!?!
<MrBen> CriticKitten: Baby, don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. No more.
<OohShiny> sharklion emotions are for men and women alike
<fluttershyFTW> screw gondor we need chuck norris
<Kandarihu> Emotions are for spiritual beings of both genders. Men are not robots
<fluttershyFTW> aww snap shes gonna cut her hair
<Gandalf_the_White> 04@Gondor: Paradox
<sharklion> OohShiny: if LotR taught us anything. it's real men cry and sing
<Canadian_Brony> Gondorception
<CriticKitten> Time for another blast of epic music plz kthx. :D
<cratorkid> one does not simply ask where Gondor was
<Aragorn> 11,01Where was Gondor...oh, I am in Gondor.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04More like real men cry, only hobbits sing
<Navy_Brony> Don't cross the memes.
<OohShiny> sharklion that's emotions
<Fl00tersh41> Where was Gondor when Osgiliath Fell?
<eosforos> lol ewen is easily the most "easy" bitch...she would easily get facked by aragorn if aragorn just wimped her to
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Does Return of the King have any good memes?
<Canadian_Brony> sharklion if LoTR didn't teach us anything, it's where Gondor was.
<TheMaster> that guy is bleeding and the battle hasn't even happened
<Sergio_Scriptor> Navy_Brony: it will destroy th entire reality
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap up....
<Major> Samwise_Gamgee: Return of the King :P
<Rohan> Samwise_Gamgee: the beacons mayhaps?
<PinkiePieYoshi64> da-dadadada
<Navy_Brony> :D
<pikoRing> That awkward moment when...
<CriticKitten> I think there was one from last year, Samwise_Gamgee. But it didn't take off like Gondor.
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when only Two Towers was worth it for memedom.
<Dumblewhore> Anyone speak Elvish here? :P
<sharklion> Canadian_Brony: :D
<fluttershyFTW> a bit
<OohShiny> Canadian_Brony LotR taught us about teamwork
<TheMaster> I am fluent in klingon and elvish
<Squallken> "they are going to die" basiclly
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Where was Gondor, when there were no subs
<Ninjazz> I only speak Halfling.
<pikoRing> I only speak Elven, not Elvish. Sorry.
<Navy_Brony> Dat lighting.
<fluttershyFTW> legolas says that theyre doomed
<Sumica> 00,10funfact, the program they made for the upcoming battle had to be midified to alow the defenders a chance
<Sergio_Scriptor> Dumblewhore: not sorry,i dont speak the language of Elvis Presley
<eleanorAwesome> The are noob feeders"
<cratorkid> Dumblewhore: preety much "this is folly" " i dont care"
<Svettponny> This shot is so DAMN cool!
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> that speech
<Canadian_Brony> I wish I could speak Elvish
<Combustiblelemons> Don't be Elfish, share what they are saying
<Riders> I'm surprised Orlando Bloom never quite took off any further than he did after these movies.
<eosforos> and theoden really is the most depressed man i have ever seen in a movie
<Canadian_Brony> ohai Sumica
<eosforos> really
<Combustiblelemons> sorry, that was a bad pumn

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> I want that armor
<eosforos> OH ITS OUR END OH ITS OUR END OH WE DIE OH OH OH...
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> dat nostalgia
<Barbetos> Major no he meant midified. They turned it into a snazzy 8bit tune.
<Sergio_Scriptor> :'(

<Sumica> 00,10ohhi

<Canadian_Brony> I drew a Castle for my final project in Drafting. My teacher attacked Warhammer style. I got 13/15 for defending.
<Meanwhile> Allo Sumica.

<Sergio_Scriptor> troll Tree
<pikoRing> Gooooooooooooooooooooood Moooooooooooooooooooorning.
<Combustiblelemons> NOT UNTIL I SEE THOSE STREET FIGHTERS PUMMELED TO DUST
<CriticKitten> Cupcakes, don't be too hasty
<otakon> OohShiny: I'm surprised there were any Spartan's at all
<CrimsonPhoenix> It looked AMAZING when I saw trailers of it a year or 2 ago
<Canadian_Brony> otakon Kandarihu IKR? We all got to draw the castle, but I finished my other projects early, so I got a head-start. IIRC, I got an overall mark of 44/55.
<Combustiblelemons> WHICH SHOULD BE ANY MOMENT NOW
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Yeah, take your time Ents. It's not like world coming to an end or sth
<otakon> Canadian_Brony: nice man

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> MAN UP!
<pikoRing> That's still no Master Sword.
<sonicrainboomer259> hey guys,guess what!!!
<MALK> hi sonicrainboomer259

<AJIsAwesome> Combustiblelemons: (\
<CriticKitten> Aragorn is the sort of guy you'd want leading your army.

<ekips> That sword is bad and you should feel bad!
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Ther's always hope... you just have to Pony up!
<Meanwhile> Deeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaad.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15I have that sword
<Ninjazz> I just figured something out. Ded spelled backwards is... ded.
<CriticKitten> And that scene really solidifies that fact.
<otakon> CriticKitten: he IS the One True King
<MASF123> hi sonicrainboomer259
<Shizuka> 13egad
<Combustiblelemons> YES! YES!
<Colt_45> otakon: because hes packing dwarvel plate
<otakon> lol
<Pinkies4thWall> ohai MASF123

<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Samwise_Gamgee: And i have that bow.
<sharklion> cya guys. sad i couldn't stay for the rest of this awesome.
<pikoRing> Hello sonicrainboomer259! I love you!
<Ryunosuke> lol
<MASF123> Hi Pinkies4thWall
<Canadian_Brony> seeya sharklion
<Combustiblelemons> lol gimli
<LordDerpington> Bye sharklion
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Gimli gains huge chainmail +5 defence -3 agility.
<fluttershyFTW> he said hes forgiven
<PinkiePieYoshi64> :$
<Rohan> Samwise_Gamgee: full scale or letter opener?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15woah
<Canadian_Brony> hi Pinkies4thWall
<Fl00tersh41> CriticKitten: I'd perfer the kind of guy who thinks about how to win and not on how to go down fighting
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Ah shi
<pikoRing> Bye-bye sharklion, love you!
<Riders> Gotta love 3 way bromances
<Major> DA HORN
<killerpony7733> Yay elves
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat horn....
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Elves!
<Dumblewhore> WHAT A TWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEST!
<AJIsAwesome> sharklion: Bye!
<Gandalf_the_White> 04The cavalry
<otakon> Gandalf_the_Brony: huge for him, he's small technically
<Meanwhile> My word.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Rohan full scale
<sonicrainboomer259> pikoRing: O_O
<Pinkies4thWall> hi Canadian_Brony
<otakon> THE ELVES!
<Michael> bye sharklion
<Dumblewhore> Gandalf_the_White: No, not yet
<Sergio_Scriptor> :) yay
<Dumblewhore> DO HO HO
<Combustiblelemons> Suddenly, elves! thousands of them!
<otakon> BILLY BROUGHT THE ELVEDS!
<Rohan> Samwise_Gamgee: moice
<CriticKitten> And then suddenly archers
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Allies.... :D
<Gandalf_the_White> 04*ahem*
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> *cue Imperial March*
<Rohan> *noice
<OohShiny> Gimli gains +5 defense, and for being a Dwarf he gains extra +2 defense for every armor he's using.
<otakon> That's a lot of level 20's.....
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Maybe not, but still, the elves honor the old tradition
<Colt_45> LOL This is bringing back Warcraft 2 matches with my buddies. ;_;
<Fl00tersh41> The elf army here wasn't in the books, right?
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Also if I recall correctly. In the books only men held Helm's Deep. The Elves didn't join the fight
<otakon> too bad they're only using Masterwork gear
<fluttershyFTW> aww i was expecting chuck norris
<Canadian_Brony> for a sec, I thought I heard a part of "Meet the Medic"
<Michael> impossibru!
<Gondor> Look at this, Where was Gandalf when Rohan fell!?
<otakon> Samwise_Gamgee: yh elves didn't show up
<TheMaster> yeah they fibbed this part
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Fl00tersh41: yep
<otakon> it's a nice addition though
<Colt_45> Id spam night elf archers until i could build an army of tree ents
<otakon> and it does not feel out of place
<Dumblewhore> So why did they add them into the films?
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> brohug
<Combustiblelemons> hugs
<TheMaster> I didn't think there would be enough elves in middle earth to fight in this battle anyway
<otakon> Dumblewhore: no idea
<fluttershyFTW> ...
<Ninjazz> Becuase elfs are pretty to look at.
<MALK> IM A HALF-ELF
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Because friendship, fuck yeah
<Gandalf_the_White> 04That's why
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Dat well-trained group :D :D :D
<TheMaster> because it makes it more likely that the defenders survive
<otakon> TheMaster: not for a whole army, but a division of archers is useful
<Ninjazz> elves*
<Fl00tersh41> Dumblewhore: Because Peter Jackson has a hardon for elves
<Buytoast> so are the other dwarves all dead?
<Canadian_Brony> Dumblewhore so they could get tall people with long blonde hair into the film
<Kencolt> It makes a better movie...
<Buytoast> or what
<Michael> dat march
<Colt_45> Question: How much food do u think an army like this needs a day?
<OohShiny> Because Pinkie Pie!
<PitViper> Mainly because in the books the elves wre busy fighting off Sauron's forces on their own front but obviously this can't easily be portrayed in the movies so instead they had the elves join the army at Helm's Deep.
<MASF123> LoTR is like the longest movie ever
<Barbetos> Hey isn't that the bad guy from Pirates of the Caribean? The East India Trading company guy?
<otakon> PitViper: thanks :)
<Combustiblelemons> the quiet before the storm
<Major> Oh shit
<sonicrainboomer259> it appears that some of the mods have changed thier names into LOTR and harry potter names o_e
<otakon> LOL
<fluttershyFTW> im half elf
<Meanwhile> lol
<Riders> It's like watching every Bioware conflict in existence if the people involved weren't petty
<Michael> they are approaching!
<Sergio_Scriptor> MASF123: nope,bollywood movies are longer
<PinkiePieYoshi64> Stallions and Mares... it is time...
<pony_2718> xD
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Dat smile
<Barbetos> Favorite part.
<fluttershyFTW> ahaahaha
<otakon> I love Gimli in these movies
<MDL> nostalgia bomb. i remember this in the ps2 game. good times.
<OohShiny> MASF123 what about Gone with the Wind?
<Combustiblelemons> it's so eerie e_e
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> :D
<Major> XD
<fluttershyFTW> gim li is so small
<Pinkies4thWall> Oh, yeah. I love this battle.
<MrBen> I loved this line
<pony_9790> lol Tiny man
<Gandalf_the_White> 04If I didn't know better I'd say he was corpsing
<Canadian_Brony> MASF123 this is the extended version too
<fluttershyFTW> gimli*
<otakon> MDL: good times indeed
<Zephyr> of course it rains
<MrBen> "Get the dwarf a box."
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> otakon: Especially elven archers
<Barbetos> could of picked a betta spot!
<Meanwhile> Where was Gondor when the storm came?
<Ninjazz> Ded.
<otakon> inb4 counting
<Canadian_Brony> MrBen LoLz
<LordDerpington> There are longer films. Experimental ones, mostly.
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15The Two Towers and Return of the King were the only good movie games
<CriticKitten> Imagine that sight.
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Give this Dwarf a stool!
<Kandarihu> Corpsing?
<Combustiblelemons> if i were fighting in a war i'd love a guy like gimli at my side
<Azuredragon> Heavy rain
<Major> Rain!
<Meanwhile> Have you noticed, on top of everything it's raining?
<Canadian_Brony> and suddenly rain
<otakon> Samwise_Gamgee: what abotu Peter Jackson's King Kong? that was pretty good
<Ninjazz> Gimili is always awesome.
<TrixieMuffin> at least it isnt raining ....oh snap
<Michael> damn rain!
<CriticKitten> The sight of thousands of enemies marching towards you as you sit there, backed into a corner.
<Major> Rain
<fluttershyFTW> PREPARE THE GIMLI PULTS
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Troll weather
<CriticKitten> That would be terrifying.
<Sergio_Scriptor> damn rain
<sonicrainboomer259> I LOVED THE HELL OUT OF THE TWO TOWERS!!!
<otakon> where is Rain?
<cratorkid> dont shoot or anything
<Rohan> Meanwhile: that a bad sign
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Corpsing is a term for when an actor accidentally breaks character when he means not to
<Combustiblelemons> atmosphere buiding
<Riders> @Samwise_Gamgee = I think Spider-Man 2 would like to have a word with you
<Canadian_Brony> hey look, Rain is here. Hi Rain! You're on LoTR!
<ekips> I suddenly have the urge to play Battle for Middleearth again...
<Meanwhile> otakon: TF2 last I looked.
<otakon> ah
<Dumblewhore> I thought it meant they laughed?
<pikoRing> Gandalf_the_Brony: That's a little morose of a term.
<Colt_45> Dumblewhore: that too
<Gandalf_the_White> 04You could say that too, yeah
<Combustiblelemons> it's an omen
<otakon> I have the urge to play The Third Age again
<Zephyr> No elvish subtitles?
<Meanwhile> otakon: And I'm sure random pinging is just as irritating nonetheless.
<Gandalf_the_White> 04It's mostly used for when they laugh
<Kencolt> Gimli is like that wisecracking guy from Brooklyn in the old WWII movies. Except he lives.
<Michael> lol
<Sergio_Scriptor> HUUUUUUUUUUU
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Zephyr: sadnly, no
<otakon> Meanwhile: oh really :P
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> *sadly
<Ryunosuke> hmm
<Combustiblelemons> Meanwhile ping
<Gandalf_the_White> 04Which is why I thought Legolas slightly smiling was him corpsing
<Colt_45> Veego Mortensen ripping it up with his elvish
*Meanwhile pokes PillowPoni.
<Ryunosuke> they are making a lego lord of the rings game
<Kandarihu> I see. Not sure how to make a nemonic device out of that.
<OohShiny> Meanwhile
<Meanwhile> Combustiblelemons: Turned my ping sound off, deal with it.
<otakon> Ryunosuke: yes they are
<Gandalf_the_White> 04But knowing the movie, I'm sure it was meant to happen
<cratorkid> Meanwhile:
<fluttershyFTW> "do not give mercy for you will not be given it"
<Dark_Horst> i bet that uruk would make an excellent death metal vocalist
<fluttershyFTW> thats what aragorn said
<otakon> LOL
<pikoRing> Fighters! START YOUR ENGINES!
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Kencolt I never realised it but you are right. The wisecracking New Yorker never survives
<MLP_Brovakiin> they need a gatling gun
<Major> Btw they are making a Lego Lord of The Rings =_=
<Michael> a box better
<pony_2718> xD
<Meanwhile> Hehehehe
<Gondor> otakon, how many people here are only 2 days away from retirement?
<Sergio_Scriptor> :D
<CriticKitten> xD
<Combustiblelemons> curse you Meanwhile you have outsmarted me U_U
<Major> XD
<SirGanjalfTheEmerald> Human: inspirational speech. Orc: HUUURRRRRR(that'll do)
<otakon> Gondor: oh many
<fluttershyFTW> im part elf
<Gandalf_the_Brony> Box +3 to accuracy.
*Meanwhile pokes PillowPoni.
<CriticKitten> Jesus.
<Canadian_Brony> a box for the dwark
<Canadian_Brony> *dwarf
<sonicrainboomer259> OMG THIS MOVIE SUCKS >_>
<CriticKitten> The sound of that would be....
<Samwise_Gamgee> 05,15Bow Master of Helm's Deep
<fluttershyFTW> I CALL DIBS ON THE FIRST ONE TO DIE
<Colt_45> LOL at aragorn. He pulls out a sword from 300metres away
<Combustiblelemons> THEIR ARROWS WILL BLOCK OUT THE SUN!
<MrBen> I'm sorry, I messed up the quote.
<otakon> CriticKitten: sharp pointy doom
<OohShiny> I'm part elf too
<Dumblewhore> Poor old guy
<Canadian_Brony> shoot already!
<Combustiblelemons> THEN WE SHALL FIGHT IN THE SHADE!

<Gandalf_the_Brony> Old man uses premature shot it is super effective!
<CriticKitten> otakon: No, I mean the NOISE.

<Meanwhile> Old man Jenkins slipped.

The performer who played him showed up as an extra, wearing an eye patch; director Peter Jackson politely asked to see what was under the patch, and then inquired if the gentleman would be interested in appearing in the film sans eye patch. The
<Gimli> 1,11gentleman was reluctant at first and quite self-conscious, but afterward said the experience had made him more comfortable with his condition.

<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The Main Door of Helm's Deep was built so heavily and so well that the real battering ram that was built to knock down the gates failed to do so until the door was weakened. Someone had built the door a little bit too well and Peter Jacksoncan heard on the Extended Edition DVD commenting that if they had to defend a castle, he would want the WETA workshop guys to

<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: In an earlier version of the script, Arwen was to have fought alongside Aragorn at Helm's Deep. Footage of Arwen fighting some Uruk-Hai was shot, but was not used in the final film.
<Colt_45> Little_Mac_Green_Glo: love and tolerate doesnt mean being a dormat. :P
<Gimli> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The scene with the Uruk-hai before the Battle for Helms Deep starts, where they stomp their spears into the ground, was inspired by the same act the stuntmen would do between takes to pass time. After seeing it, Peter Jackson liked it, and put it in the movie.
<Little_Mac_Green_Glo> OR...We can punch THEM!!!!
