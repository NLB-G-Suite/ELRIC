<MahBoi777> it's so shiny @_@ MY EYES
<GrimGallop> lol
<Snuffsis> Honestly, you should get Portal 2 Phase 4, it's so damn good
<Phase4> Wrex would totaly be a brony
<Phase4> Snuffsis: played it, second best game ever!
<the4th|busy> dat hax
<Barrel_of_Fun> Does anyone here play Wakfu?
<Phase4> Snuffsis: best is portal 1
<Snuffsis> I like Portal 1 and 2 for different reasons though.
<Phase4> ^
<Phase4> is true
<Snuffsis> Portal 1 is a much better puzzle game, Portal 2 has a much better story.
<CupcakeWarrior> Good night everypony
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Night CupcakeWarrior
<Phase4> night CupcakeWarrior
<MahBoi777> that SMW music
<Snuffsis> :D
<the4th|busy> nightCupcakeWarrior
<Phase4> Snuffsis: i dont think they should make a portal 3, but more puzles for 2 would be excelent
<Snuffsis> Goodnight cupcakewarrior
<Snuffsis> I'd rather have Half-life 3 sometime in the near future. xD
<RainBroDash> 10I'm heading off everyone, gonna go get ready for lectures. Cya SuperBrony64 <333
<Phase4> wait, if you go through the fire do you warp or die?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Later RainBroDash ^_^
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Good luck :3
<Phase4> later RainBroDash , enjoy the lectures
<RainBroDash> 10thank you.
<Barrel_of_Fun> Have fun and learn a lot Rainbrodash
<MahBoi777> bye RainBroDash!
<GrimGallop> Later RainBroDash
<RainBroDash> 10^_^
<Snuffsis> c ya rainbro
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: nice save
<MahBoi777> that was close SB
<Thunderpony> I see no ponies
<Snuffsis> Yoshi is close
<the4th|busy> datz a YOSHI
<Snuffsis> Yoshi is dino pony
<Phase4> i've allso got uni, had 2 lectures and a lab today. if anyone is wondering wether or not to go, do it
<Phase4> uni is awesome
<Thunderpony> A dino pony?
<Thunderpony> You mean like piccolo?
<otakon> bye RainBroDash
<MahBoi777> Yoshi is great
<GrimGallop> Yoshi is clearly from Namek
<otakon> Hells Yeah
<Dashie_Dashie> I can see yoshi being in ponyville
<the4th|busy> ^
<Barrel_of_Fun> lol
<Snuffsis> Yoshi isn't a namekian. >:(
<otakon> Dashie_Dashie: mfw Yoshi loses an eating competition with Pinkie
<otakon> Snuffsis: I'mma think it.
<Snuffsis> :D
<Dashie_Dashie> that'd be a tough call
<GrimGallop> Of course he is. He's green, and his species reproduces with eggs.
<Snuffsis> HE's not asexual
<otakon> hold on
<GrimGallop> Therefore, Yoshis = Namekians and Namekians = Yoshis
<Thunderpony> He kinda is
<Thunderpony> Yoshi lays eggs
<the4th|busy> WAHOO
<Thunderpony> The only reason he would be able to lay eggs is if he could use them to reproduce
<Barrel_of_Fun> has Superbrony64 already cleared SMG2?
<otakon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Bouuw5jWk
<otakon> Relevant
<MahBoi777> Barrel_of_Fun: yah
<Thunderpony> Yoshi has been shown to be a guy or at least very manly, so....kinda a-sexual.
<Snuffsis> Or maybe, in their species the male lay the eggs, while the women fertilise them.
<Snuffsis> Like seahorses
<Snuffsis> Since there are female yoshis
<otakon> that makes NO sense
<MahBoi777> BAWS galaxy
<GrimGallop> Either they're asexual or every one in any of the Mario games where they throw eggs is female.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I didn't get all the green stars yet Barrel_of_Fun :/
<otakon> another Prankster

<Krakass> Male seahorse just carry them.

<MahBoi777> YES

<Snuffsis> :(
<Sumica> 00,10well you do still have to catch them.
<MahBoi777> ikr?
<Snuffsis> Easiest is probably super mario 64

<Thunderpony> It's mama luigi!
<Snuffsis> Stuck in luigis nose
<Sumica> 00,10always knew marios head was full of crap

<GrimGallop> Pfft, that cannon requires you to beat the game 100% anyway
<MahBoi777> GULP
<the4th|busy> if anyone knows the importance of taking a break, it'd be Nintendo. :D
<Snuffsis> GrimGallop: Still makes it easy to max 1-ups! :P

<GrimGallop> I remember that glitch. How did I ever find that? x.x
<Snuffsis> You need to do the backwards jump thingie
<Snuffsis> real fast
<MahBoi777> endless stairs mah boi
*applejack096 is watching the stream an weirdly Super Mario Bros on pop tv!!!! FREAKY STUFF!!!!
<Snuffsis> Wooo
<Snuffsis> :D
<MahBoi777> WHAT THE F&*(&*??
<GrimGallop> o.O
<Snuffsis> THese glitches are awesome
<applejack096> lol no really its true
<MahBoi777> if I would have known about these glitches as a kid I wouldn't have wasted time collecting stars!:|
<Phase4> this seems to be working
<applejack096> wow whos playing this??
<Snuffsis> SB64
<MahBoi777> SB65
<applejack096> so hes mario??
<Snuffsis> ye
<applejack096> hes good
<Snuffsis> Years of practice
<Snuffsis> :D
<MahBoi777> SB's name fits him very well
<applejack096> lol wats his real name???
<Snuffsis> He has a masters degree in gaming... xD
<OtakuTom> You guys should see the Tool-Assisted speedrun of this game...0 stars, 5 minutes and 2 seconds to beat all 3 bowser fights.
<Snuffsis> seen it
<applejack096> dem bombs!
<Snuffsis> Can't really say its a real speedrun though
<OtakuTom> Why not?
<applejack096> dat wind!!
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Better :3
<MahBoi777> I can't dash through like this, lol, I gotta take it slow
<Snuffsis> the game isn't beaten the way it's spposed to
<Phase4> woah, you should see the glitches i'm gettin on this game
<Thunderpony> So long gay bowser
<applejack096> wats SuperBrony64s real name???????
<MahBoi777> found all the stars on this game, lol
<Snuffsis> Mario
<Thunderpony> Britanny
<OneTrickPony> lol
<MahBoi777> Larry
*Midnight_Tempest bursts into flames
<Snuffsis> Hello midnight
<applejack096> no its not htf does he dothat
*Sumica tosses a wool blanket over Midnight_Tempest
<OtakuTom> I'd argue against that...while they don't collect the stars like the game wants them to, they are completing the main goal of defeating Bowser.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02O___o
<MahBoi777> lol this part was a pain in tha ass
<OneTrickPony> lol
<Midnight_Tempest> Sumica <3 *rolls around in the blanket*
<Snuffsis> So you think it's a valid speedrun when they cheat their way through the game? :P
<MahBoi777> not really
<MahBoi777> I call HAX
<OtakuTom> I call it "creative use of game mechanics"
<Midnight_Tempest> well, im off to bed now... night all!
<MahBoi777> gnight Midnight_Tempest
<Hodiku> night Midnight_Tempest!
<Snuffsis> it's not game mechanics, it's bug exploitation.
<Snuffsis> :P
<Krakass> Bye Midnight_Tempest
<OtakuTom> They aren't entering any cheat codes. They're just abusing glitches. SB64 did it here to get to the final Bowswer fight...normally you have to have 70 stars to get there.
<Snuffsis> Yea i know.
<MahBoi777> speeding through the level is fine, but glitching to other worlds and all that, lol I mean come oooon
<Snuffsis> Speedruns should, to me, be done by completing the game properly without abusing glitches.
<MahBoi777> yes
<OtakuTom> It's ment as entertainment and to see just how quickly a game can be beaten. It's not taken as a legitimate speedrun.
<MahBoi777> it is pretty entertaining, lol
<Snuffsis> Thats why, OtakuTom, i said "Can't really say it's a real speedrun though". :P
<Thunderpony> So long gay bowser
<MahBoi777> well done SB
<OtakuTom> Some people call them tool-assisted superplays...I'm just used to calling them speedruns, 'cause a lot of videos still use that term.
<Snuffsis> And i call it cheating.
<applejack096> i UR GETTING DEFETED BY A TINY MINI GUY BOWSER U GAY FUCKIN FREAK!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL U R A GAY DEAD FREAK NOW!!!!
<MahBoi777> man that hat must be glued on
<Phase4|Games> LOLWUT applejack096
<Snuffsis> Bowser isn't dead
<Snuffsis> He can't die
<Phase4|Games> sry, caps was on

<Snuffsis> back in the n64 days
<Thunderpony> Princess peach sounds..old
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well...at the very least you can't save your games.

<Thunderpony> And talks about cake
<applejack096> lol for mario
<Thunderpony> Ok i see where this is going
<MahBoi777> Krakass: nah, I don't feel like getting mah ass kicked, lol
<OtakuTom> I remember getting this game for Christmas the year it and the N64 came out...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02AND THEN NOTHING SEXUAL HAPPENED
<GrimGallop> lol
<OtakuTom> About 3 weeks later, I had all 120 stars...lol
<Phase4> its a piece of cake to make a pretty cake
<Snuffsis> It's a game for kids !
<applejack096> Where Thunderpony wheres it goin??
<Thunderpony> UNTIL ALL THE SEXUAL HAPPENED
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You only need about 16 stars to beat this game.
<Thunderpony> sex
<applejack096> Oh
<applejack096> kk
<SuperBrony64> 10,02IF
<SuperBrony64> 10,02You exploit glitches
<applejack096> Weird
<SuperBrony64> 10,0271 otherwise.
<Snuffsis> Yea.
<Snuffsis> 71 for being legit
<Thunderpony> I would exploit glitches
<OtakuTom> SuperBrony64, 0 stars are needed if exploiting glitches.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02lol, without using a Game Shark I mean :3
<Phase4> cant you glitch through the stairs?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Yes
<MahBoi777> ah gameshark
<Thunderpony> I would do both
<MahBoi777> lol
<Phase4> or is that with 17 stars
<Snuffsis> These glitches would've been patched day 1 if it was released today. :P
<OtakuTom> Same here, without any actual cheats, just game glitches.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PLAYING MY GAME
<Phase4> Snuffsis: there would have been more glitches day 1
<MahBoi777> u shud play Super mario World sometime
<Snuffsis> schhh
<OtakuTom> Oooh...SMW is such a great game
<Snuffsis> Phase4: don't forget day 1 dlc
<MahBoi777> ikr?
<applejack096> lololololololololololololololololoolololololololololololololololololololololololololololoolooololooolololoololololooolololololololololololiolololololololololololol Cause im bored!
<Phase4> Snuffsis: plus hats, would allso be able to buy different hats for mario
<SuperBrony64> 10,02No spamming applejack096 O__O
<OtakuTom> Let's see...I was...oh...7...when the SNES came out? something like that?
<Snuffsis> yes, hats.
<MahBoi777> this was the glory days
<OtakuTom> No...I was 5 XD
<Snuffsis> Haha, my mother still plays her SNES
<OtakuTom> Same here...
<Snuffsis> She's badass
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Wow, what a cool mom O___O
<Krakass> My mother loved Super Mario RPG
<OtakuTom> I play Mega Man X about once a month all the way through.
<MahBoi777> LOL bice Snuffsis
<GrimGallop> I'm going to grab some caffeine
<xles> Now I know you're not talking about my mother.
<applejack096> it not spamming its saying lol over and over!
<MahBoi777> *nice
<Snuffsis> She hates 3D games, she's all about NES and SNES
<Phase4> ...when was the snes released?
<Snuffsis> She knows EVERY extra-life and secret in Legend of Zelda. the second game
<GrimGallop> Then I'm going to fire up ZSNES and simultaneously play this :D
<xles> Phase4: 92 IIRC?
<MahBoi777> dang, it's dark and I can't see my keyboard very well so excuse my spelling errors, lol
<OtakuTom> Heck, I still play my NES from time to time.
<Krakass> Sounds like someone needs mavis beacon teaches typing.
<Phase4> ohai xles , how bout the nes? when was that
<xles> 86 maybe?
<Snuffsis> NES 88
<Snuffsis> i think it was
<OtakuTom> SNES was 199...1, IIRC...the copyright date on SMW was 1990 - 1991
<MahBoi777> Makin Bacon? mmmmm I liek bacon
<Snuffsis> 83 for the NES in the US
<SuperBrony64> 10,02SNES was 1990
<Snuffsis> 91 us and 92 europe for snes
<Phase4> so if the nes came out while you were 16, you would be 40 now
<Phase4> which is old enough to have kids playing videogames
<xles> Ah... It was 92 over here in communist europe.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Well, 1991 for USA
<OtakuTom> I was 3 when my family got the NES...6 when we got the SNES.
<Phase4> that sounds wrong, i think my derp math
<MahBoi777> anybody ever make it to the SPECIAL world in this game?
<Phase4> -1?
<Phase4> never actualy played this game, read about -1 though
<OtakuTom> I love the SPECIAL world
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I have an NES, SNES, N64, GCN, Wii, Virtual Boy, Game Boy, GBC, GBP, GBA SP, Nintendo DS, DS Lite, DSi, 3DS, PSP, PSX, PS2, PS3, PS Vita, Xbox, Xbox 360, Intellivision, Atari 2600, Genesis, Master System, Saturn, Dreamcast, Game Gear, etc.

<Thunderpony> Hugs superbrony64* right here
<Snuffsis> :D
<OtakuTom> I've never met anyone that had more than me.
<xles> According to wikipedia, I'm absolutely correct about 92 for snes and 86 for nes! ...But only if you live in europe, which I do. *rolleyes*
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I love the virtual boy :3

<Placebo> Damn you, SB
<SuperBrony64> 10,02For my Psychology of Prejudice and Stereotyping class
<Phase4> sure sb
<SuperBrony64> 10,02	I stand before you friends and fellow classmates, not as a student, not as a man, not as a white person, but instead as a human being. Being human is what links us all together. We are all of the same species. It is the foundation for which defines our very existence. Build upon that, we have our culture, the result of generations and generations of specific groups of humans working
<SuperBrony64> 10,2together for a common cause. On top of that, we have our own mentality, it defines our interests, how we act, and so on. Individual behaviors and qualities make us unique. For the good, we use it to make us stand out from others. For the bad, we use it to judge.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02	Judgement is no stranger to our way of life, it allows us to assess a situation and determine what’s the best cause in the end. However, others use this as a chance to belittle those around him or her. People make fun of other cultures and people make fun of other races.
<Phase4> text wall

<MASF123> The Penguin goes Straight
<RaveBrony> Woah, thanks, Sumica. Totally forgot about that :o
<KwakLad> did i miss a picture?

<RaveBrony> I have one where he is standing on 4 legs, but it makes the shield look stupid to have on :D
<Phase4> btw, this is what i'm using to shorten links: http://derpy.me/3otCm
*Phase4 == ariscop
<MASF123> True...he wouldn't hold it.
<KwakLad> yeah i agree with sumica but i dont think its a full profile, because by the way the legs are and seeing that the body is turned slightly towards the viewer, the head would also be turned a bit
*GrimGallop must vanish, as his computer is starting to run very slowly for some reason
<Sumica> 00,10true KwakLad
<RaveBrony> O.o
<KwakLad> also is that guy brittish in badman? so hes evil

<Derpy1> 6_9 o3o
<Phase4> wow, so few people in the regulars room
<Derpy123> Hai Derpy1!
<Derpy1> so on saturday when the new mlp episode comes on it will appear on this live stream o3o
<Sumica> 00,10hard to say, just so it matches the perspective more.
<Sumica> 00,10yes Derpy1
<RaveBrony> Plus i wanted to make him a unicorn (so he can Use the sword), would I horn look out of place or no?
<Derpy1> hhmmmm but why is it on tv land not hub network
<Phase4> pick up the batphone in the batcar to tell batbutler to meet us at the batcave
<Phase4> bat bat bat
<Derpy123> On ED, they said the new episode does not come out this Saturday
<Derpy1> on march 3rd it does
<Sumica> !cd
<Tom> Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 2 days, 5 hours, 53 minutes, 39 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
<Derpy1> yup saturday
<Derpy1> so does this thing change to hub network when its available
<KwakLad> RaveBrony i think removing the left nostrle might make the eye look correctly positioned (left according to viewers position)
<Sumica> 00,10it's not realy on tv land it's just there are no non watermarked versions of this show.
<Derpy1> so its just a stall until hub network is available o3o
<Derpy123> I think that ED is wrong, the new episode will most likely be on Sat
<KwakLad> Alfred is badass!
<Sumica> 00,10stall?
<RaveBrony> ^
<Derpy1> well idk how to say it
<Derpy123> no wait, it is acutally on Sat
<Sumica> 00,10i guess first off I should say we dont stream pony all the time.
<Derpy123> Yhere is another ep with Fluttershy
<KwakLad> Derpy1 Let me ask, do you assume we normally stream the HUB perminantly?
<Derpy1> i assumed yes o3o
<KwakLad> ahh
<KwakLad> no
<Derpy123> That airs on March 24
<RaveBrony> Derpy1, no this is just a fun stream that does silly stuff :)
<Derpy1> o3o not the 3rd for the new mlp episode ?
<Derpy123> Oh RaveBrony, your so silly. :)
<RaveBrony> :$
<KwakLad> Derpy1 only on new pony eps (or some other events im not sure of) the rest of the time its whatever streamers want or are requested to stream (if they feel nice)
<Sumica> 00,10oh hey, they are using the equestria girls promo again.
<Derpy123> Yeah new episoe is on Sat
<RaveBrony> Really, Sumica? o.o
<KwakLad> Derpy1 the next new pony ep is this saturday (the 3rd)
<Derpy123> Haha that promo was funny
<RaveBrony> ^
<Sumica> 00,10yeah all this talk of hub prompted me to turn the tv on.

<Twi_Fi> BronyinJapan:すばらしい
<CountDoofus> I'm at work, feel like drawing. come home, don't feel like drawing. conclusion: work kills ambition
<ofna01> KAmmer
<Kammerjunk> ofna
<ofna01> i've read every book in my house
<Snuffsis> CountDoofus: You only realised that now?
<ofna01> EVEN THE DICTIONARY
<BronyinJapan> I cant read Japanese that good
<Kammerjunk> Well, go to EQD!
<KwakLad> what CountDoofus said, conclusion, dont work
<Kammerjunk> There's like a million fanfics there.
<Snuffsis> It's the same with school
<Snuffsis> School kills creativity and diverse thinking
<Snuffsis> instead of promoting it
<Kammerjunk> Well, yes.
<ofna01> yes
<Kammerjunk> Besides that, many schools still work with outdated methods.
<Snuffsis> everyschool does
<BronyinJapan> Kammerjunk i agree
<Iwubponiez> hai everypony :)
<Kammerjunk> Depends on the level of education, actually.
<Kammerjunk> Oh hi, Iwubponiez.
<BronyinJapan> ohai Iwubponiez
<ofna01> half the kids at my school were retards
<Snuffsis> It's all based on an industrial method where everyone is lined up in grades depending on their creation date
<Snuffsis> instead of what they're able to do.
<ofna01> wat
<Kammerjunk> This HTX school I toured was pretty heavy on newish technology.
<BronyinJapan> YES YES me and my dad think so to
<Iwubponiez> happy derpy day 6_9
<ofna01> happy derpy day!
<Kammerjunk> I have no celebrated Derpy day.
<ofna01> everyone use this emote in 3 seconds
<Snuffsis> There are some methods which try to break away from that kind of method, but that just makes it worse.
<Kammerjunk> I have no muffins.
<ofna01> 6_9
<ofna01> 3
<ofna01> 2

<BronyinJapan> lol drying pan
<CountDoofus> who's ready to see something sad? http://ziemniax.deviantart.com/gallery/#/d4q80ba
<Kammerjunk> Snuffsis: Shame it's 1920x1080.
<ofna01> GAAAH
<Kammerjunk> Both my screens are 1920x1200.
<ofna01> NO
<Snuffsis> You use a bigger one?
<BronyinJapan> Snuffsis Niceeee
<Kammerjunk> Which is really darn annoying.
<Snuffsis> Kammerjunk: Stop being so 16:10 and be more 16:9
<Kammerjunk> So many pony wallpapers are made in 1920x1080.
<Kammerjunk> But the bigger screens, man!
<ofna01> WHY COUNT WHY
<KwakLad> CountDoofus: why did she not go to her own home? or was it repo'd?
<CountDoofus> idk, ask the artist :p
<Snuffsis> You should know that 16:9 is the PROPER widescreen format. Hmph!
<Kammerjunk> You should know that bigger is better.
<Iwubponiez> i will take her with me :(
<RaveBrony> *sigh* I want a computer drawing program....
<Snuffsis> Gimp is open source
<Snuffsis> try that
<Kammerjunk> RaveBrony: Go torrent PhotoShop or Illustrator.
<RaveBrony> :o
<Kammerjunk> Actually, just get the master suite.
<Snuffsis> http://www.gimp.org/
<KwakLad> RaveBrony: http://paint-tool-sai.deviantart.com/ whats what wrek is using atm
<Hazard> well im nearly done installing that stupid driver update
<ofna01> NEED A DISPENSER HERE!
<KwakLad> try and find it some otherway
<Jim> Pootis spencer here
<Kammerjunk> Need a teleporter here!
<RaveBrony> I thot Wrek used some Adobe thing O.o
<CountDoofus> he used to
<Kammerjunk> CS5 is best CS.
<Snuffsis> Nah, he uses sai
<KwakLad> maybe sometimes
<KwakLad> but atm he used SAI
<Kammerjunk> RaveBrony: Wrek used to use Illustrator.
<Kammerjunk> But yeah, he uses SAI now.
<RaveBrony> o.o
<CountDoofus> Wrek used to use Adobe Illustrator... but then he took a SAI to the hard drive.
<Snuffsis> But he also has a tablet worth atleast 300 bucks :P
<Kammerjunk> I think it's for different methods of drawing.
<RaveBrony> I need $70 tho :D
<Twi_Fi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vMPgnUC_9A
<Kammerjunk> Hey, guess what's stuck in my head.
<ofna01> POOTISPECER HERE
<Snuffsis> Ravebrony, like i said. Try gimp : http://www.gimp.org/
<Snuffsis> It's free and decent
<AllisZero> After a year working in Photoshop exclusively, going back to SAI and playing with it, I miss is so much.
<Kammerjunk> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4TedkQP_hM is what's stuck in my head.
<CountDoofus> NOO
<BronyinJapan> Hey who wants to see a picture of what I look like?
<RaveBrony> :o
<Kammerjunk> YES.
<RaveBrony> Ill try those
<AllisZero> The pressure level for lines and brushes is so much more developed than in PS.
<Jim> That'd be cool
<AllisZero> Lineart is delicious to do in SAI
<ofna01> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo0cAk35pDg
<CountDoofus> wonder if there'll ever be any G4 sea ponies tho
<ofna01> my TF2 micpsam
<ofna01> micspam*
<Kammerjunk> I really miss the days of TF2 class updates.
<Kammerjunk> Everyone would just go one class.
<Snuffsis> Ravebrony: you could also try http://www.portalgraphics.net/en/oc/
<Kammerjunk> So we'd have an entire team of engies or snipers.
<Jim> Like when the scout got his update
<Snuffsis> It's a good software as well.
<Kammerjunk> Yeah.
<RaveBrony> The many thing is even if I torrent a program, I still need one of those drawing things, lol
<ofna01> i dont have very many Scout items
<Kammerjunk> I don't always play Scout.
<Kammerjunk> But when I do, I use the FaN.
<ofna01> i have Soda Popper,Bonk,Winger,Sun-on-a-Stick
<CountDoofus> tried using Inkscape once... bloody thing crashed while coloring an area
<Snuffsis> RaveBrony: For a beginner, i'd recommend a Wacome Bamboo tablet for drawing
<Snuffsis> Wacom Bamboo*
<RaveBrony> Yeah :P
<Kammerjunk> Just, please.
<ofna01> bamBOO
<Kammerjunk> Get one with a screen.
<Snuffsis> They are quite cheap. :P
<ofna01> anyone wanna play TF2?
<Kammerjunk> I bought a Wacom Bamboo tablet WITHOUT a screen, and it's difficult to learn using.
<Snuffsis> KAmmerjunk: He probably doesn't have THAT much money to spend. :P
<Kammerjunk> ofna01: I just booted it up, actually.
<ofna01> ill start up my dell
<Jim> I sure wanna
<Kammerjunk> I don't even know what they cost.
<ofna01> its on there
<RaveBrony> Meh, Ill just have to deal atm. I just think Id like my drawings better if they were on the computer :\
<KwakLad> if i get a new one i would want one with a screen
<BronyinJapan> Hey who wants to see a picture of what I look like when I arrvied in Japan?
<Jim> I remember when the backburner was really OP
<Snuffsis> Well Wacom Cintiq 24HD Cost about 2400 dollars.
<Jim> http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/067/8/8/tf2__pyro___x___x_everywhere__by_dragynn-d3b7n4s.jpg
<Kammerjunk> wat
<Kammerjunk> We may never know what the Pyro said.
<Snuffsis> There cheapest one is Wacom Cintiq 12wx and cost about 900 dollars.
<CountDoofus> BronyinJapan: Bring it.
<Snuffsis> -re

<RaveBrony> Lucky...wish i was in Japan
<KwakLad> as do i
<KwakLad> it would be beneficial to my calm
<Kammerjunk> I wish I was in the UK.
<Snuffsis> hah
<unfoundbug> Kammerjunk, its really not great
<Snuffsis> Noone WANTS to live in the UK
<Snuffsis> they only live there because they have to
<Snuffsis> true story
<Kammerjunk> It got to be better than Denmark.
<Capn_fisty> Doubt it
<unfoundbug> it really cant
<KwakLad> unfoundbug Kammerjunk its not that bad in the UK its just not worth staying in
<Snuffsis> Denmark is awesome though
<Snuffsis> Weeds, drinking at 16
<KwakLad> only visit no more
<ofna01> booting TF2 up
<Snuffsis> etc
<unfoundbug> theres an understatement
<ofna01> TOO MUCH SPAM
<RaveBrony> ^
<Jim> Hey Kammerjunk, mountains
<Kammerjunk> I don't drink except for at parties. Weed is illegal, but I don't do it anyway.
<Jim> u mad?
<ofna01> Kammerjunk
<BronyinJapan1> Hello?
<ofna01> ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PLAY TF2?
<Snuffsis> Kammerjunk It's not Illegal, but it's not legal either
<Snuffsis> It's just decriminalized
<ofna01> decriminalized?
<KwakLad> Well im back to school for the second time today
<ofna01> is that even a word?
<RaveBrony> Meh, im not in the mood for TF2
<Kammerjunk> Jim: What'd I use mountains for?
<KwakLad> talk to you later my little ponies
<RaveBrony> :(
<Snuffsis> Meaning you can't get arrested for using it
<BronyinJapan1> bye KwakLad
<Jim> Well, you wouldn't know

<Kammerjunk> Jim: I don't climb anything. I don't even go to fitness.
<Kammerjunk> I just have this machine at home.
<Snuffsis> Kammerjunk: Neither do i, but i still enjoy the occasional joint (haven't taken any in forever now though)
<Snuffsis> It's just so relaxing when sitting in the sofa.
<ofna01> im online Kammer

<Jim> oh well, everybody's got different interests I guess
<Kammerjunk> I would not smoke anything if my life didn't depend on it.

<Kammerjunk> Oh, great. I got another weapon on TF2 I don't use, but I'll keep anyway.
<Snuffsis> Give me stuff then, if you don't need it! :D

<RaveBrony> :D
<Cypresswolf> Nice vid :)
<Cypresswolf> *kicks computer cause its taking too long to load 20 seconds* :| Nothings going right this morning
<Cypresswolf> Im going to get something to eat. Whataburger is open and serve burgers 24/7 :)
<CountDoofus> suddenly TF2 crash. cba to restart
<Cypresswolf> Before I go, am I the only one a bit agravated McDonalds makes you wait till after 11 am for a burger?
<CountDoofus> don't think burgers as breakfast is quite healthy
<CountDoofus> but hey, we're all gonna die anyway, so screw McD
<Twi_Fi> Anything from McDonalds for breakfast is unhealthy.
<Twi_Fi> But it tastes good.
<Jim> even the salad
<Cypresswolf> Why shoulnt it be, Denny's serves Steak & Eggs for breakfast. Burger has bread, cheese for dairy, meat for protein, tomatoes and pickles for vegetables
<RaveBrony> if you wanna call it meat :D
<CountDoofus> so who wants to see me with a monkey on my shoulder?
*RaveBrony raises his hand
<Cypresswolf> Whataburger has better beef patties anyway
<CountDoofus> http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v31/Connor/?action=view&current=ikmetaap.jpg
<Twi_Fi> Is that you on that guy's shoulder?
<CountDoofus> o u
<Twi_Fi> :$
<Snuffsis> haj again
<Cypresswolf> Now this is a burger! http://www.bestburgerrecipes.com/image-files/tall-hamburger.jpg
<CountDoofus> Warning: may cause instant heart attack.
<Twi_Fi> The calories are over 9,000!
<AllisZero> Dang it.
<Cypresswolf> Shaggy & Scooby had no problem with size :P
<AllisZero> Did I really just take 40 minutes to do an update and fix someone's Excel from crashing?
<Dashie_Dashie> Cypresswolf, that's death on a bun.
<Dashie_Dashie> literally.
<Cypresswolf> :) Deep Fry for instant death
<AllisZero> As a fat foreigner, the first time I came across deep-fried Oreo's I realized "This shit's gone too far, America"
<Cypresswolf> Actually, only if you can finish in one sitting
<Cypresswolf> Allis, you may want to avoid Texas State Fairs...
<Snuffsis> Yea applejack woohooo
<CountDoofus> I was in the States for 3 weeks in 2004... Don't think a day went by without eating at least 1 burger
<Twi_Fi> I eat too many burgers for my own good.
<AllisZero> I've been living here since 03
<CountDoofus> and coming back to the States, in a few months, can't wait!
<AllisZero> The novelty wears off eventually, trust me
<Cypresswolf> Rodeo is guilty of it too, I've seen fried cotton candy
<Snuffsis> What we talking about?
<Cypresswolf> burgers, fried food, and all manner of unhealthy tasty food
<CountDoofus> I suddenly have a craving for frozen bananas
<Twi_Fi> Fried cotton candy? Would Discord approve?
<CountDoofus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSvaX6t7rUM&list=SL&feature=sh_e_se
<Snuffsis> Mm, mm, interesting
*Snuffsis nods in agreement while eating a slice of pizza
<Cypresswolf> Discord: YES! YES!
<Cypresswolf> http://www.motifake.com/image/demotivational-poster/0901/ultimate-death-burger-dinner-food-demotivational-poster-1233352462.jpg
<Snuffsis> Is that from that heartattack burger joint thing?
<CountDoofus> http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/man-suffers-heart-attack-while-eating-heart-attack-185717972.html
<Cypresswolf> the one where they sell the Triple Bypass Burger? perhaps
<CountDoofus> oh the irony
<Snuffsis> ye
<Cypresswolf> I saw that article a few days ago...I consider the name to be a warning
<Cypresswolf> *warning enough
<Jim> brb
<Saske909090> ehhh
<Saske909090> so bored...
<KwakLad2> That's not irony, if he was eating a "heart curer" burger and suffered a heart attack, then I think it would be ironic
<AllisZero> Honestly I like a burger as much as the next guy
<AllisZero> And yesterday I made a mistake of eating more than I should
<RaveBrony> Lol!! Yeah
<AllisZero> But seriously, eating that much fat is just dumb
<RaveBrony> ^
<CountDoofus> I get my share of fast/junkfood on a weekly basis... maybe I should get my cholesterol level checked
<AllisZero> I checked mine last year, my bad cholesterol was good, the good cholestrol was low
<Cypresswolf> some stalls, mainly in the carnival area of the Houston Rodes, makes fried frog legs. These aint the ones you find in Lousiana, no no! These are over cooked, and tough as nails to eat. making them terrible
<AllisZero> I'm just fat due to sedentarism really
<RaveBrony> I want to make some epic cupcakes or something :D
<RaveBrony> I workout for an hour or more everyday, I fear being fat sooo much >.<
<Cypresswolf> In my view, if you can stomach a couple of those, you can handle anything
<CountDoofus> I'd love some fat... my digestive system always works in overdrive, so I can eat pretty much all I want and gain zilch weight
<KwakLad2> I have been told I would fill out since starting to ride a motorbike, the opposite has happened
<AllisZero> ^ I hate you
<Snuffsis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM9aRvnAlsM best scene ever! :D
<AllisZero> I'm pretty much the opposite. Everything I eat goes straight to some fat deposit
<Snuffsis> Oh pinkie pie, you so cute. <3
<Cypresswolf> http://pinkie.ponychan.net/chan/files/src/132979854883.jpg
<CountDoofus> oh well. gonna do some L4D and get me a kebab after
<Snuffsis> Doofus
<CountDoofus> aye?
<Snuffsis> wanna multiplay? :D
<CountDoofus> as long as it isn't Versus :)
<Snuffsis> Yea, coop. campaign or something ? :D
<CountDoofus> I'm pretty good at campaigns, but terrible in vs
<CountDoofus> not a big fan of survival
<Cypresswolf> I just found the creepiest Apple family pic O_o Granny Smith, Big Mac, AB, & AJ at a table full of meat and they're tearing it apart
<Cypresswolf> Google image search Baked Bads...
<CountDoofus> seen it. didn't sleep that night.
<Cypresswolf> and the chat goes quiet...

<Dashie_Dashie> gentlemen.

<Ingwaz> you have the friendship express dvd?
<Tovler> They probably will change it in future DVD releases.
<Meeplord> Tacos are delicious
<Saske909090> gotta find it...

<SuperBrony64> 10,02hai ScootaChicken :3
<ScootaChicken> SuperBrony64 is a silly filly :3
<SuperBrony64> 10,02i liek silly filly :3
<flutter_spin> My reaction to derpy? No reaction. I had no idea what "derpy" was at that moment.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02today is silly filly day :3
<Saske909090> ...
<SuperBrony64> 10,02cause derpy is a silly filly :>
<pony_9374> Pegasister here~! (\
*SuperBrony64 /)(\ pony_9374
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Dat Rain
<Meeplord> So, are fillies girl ponies or child ponies? Im still bit confused bout tht
<DashWithRainbows> SuperBrony64 Finally you have clothes on.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02IKR
<Rain> fillies are young female ponies
<flutter_spin> In fact the order was derpy -> derpy chat -> bronystate -> ballad of a brony -> EQD ... the rest fit after that
<Meeplord> Ah
<pony_9374> w00t~
<Meeplord> What are young male ponies?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02silly fillies is gender neutral in my opinion though :3
<CrazyBronyDonut> My herd handed out muffins on the street downtown and near the university /)^3^(\
<Rain> colts
<Saske909090> whats your opinion on Discord?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Awesome CrazyBronyDonut :D
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I want a muffin :3
<pony_9374> Oh my gosh, who else is addicted to At the Gala and Winter Wrap Up remixes? = u=
<Meeplord> Hm.....seems legit
<Ingwaz> indeed SuperBrony64
<Morty> Superbrony64 you are the silliest filly
<Ingwaz> he is a silly filly
<CrazyBronyDonut> yep we had letters we wrote too:)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02i liek silly :>
<flutter_spin> Not enough history about Discord. I would like to know more about Discords relationship with Luna & Celestia.
<Rain> adult females are called mares and adult males are called stallions
<RainbowJack> happy Derpy hooves day
<Meeplord> i knew tht
<flutter_spin> But Discord with Q voice = awesome sauce
<Saske909090> more relationship with them?
<CrazyBronyDonut> happy Derpy dat RainbowJack
<CrazyBronyDonut> day*
<Saske909090> more relationship with ERIS
<Saske909090> :P
<Meeplord> Id be in between colt and stallion ^^
<Saske909090> Eris=Female version of discord
<pony_9374> Derpy Hooves day? o.o
<Saske909090> eeeeeeyup
<CrazyBronyDonut> yep
<pony_9374> Nice XD
<flutter_spin> I still think it would be awesome if they did a kind of future version of MLP. I would love seeing where each pony stands in the future.
<Meeplord> Billy and Mandt <3
<Saske909090> next question issss
<Meeplord> mandy*
<pony_9374> Stempunk pony XD
<CrazyBronyDonut> i would like to see the CMC grown up
<pony_9374> *steampunk
<Saske909090> do you like pyro?
*Rain is a mare
<Saske909090> wow
<Capn_fisty> That sudden nostalgia wave Meeplord
<Saske909090> okay this question doesnt count
<Meeplord> Yeah lol
<Saske909090> hmmm
<Ingwaz> flutter_spin: the problem with that is as people grow up, they sometimes grow apart a bit, ponies like rarity, if her business caught on, would probably become a little distant with the rest of the mane 6
<Ingwaz> and that kind bums the whole friendship is magic thing
<Saske909090> YOUR ALL OPINION ON STALKERLOO
<Ingwaz> MY OPINION IS YOU SHOULD USE LESS CAPS
<Saske909090> sorry :P
*Rain throws a shoe at Saske909090 "no all caps!"
<KwakLad> more pony music please, im not sure what to listen to
<Saske909090> plz forget derpy :P
*Rain throws a shoe at Ingwaz too
*Ingwaz dodges
<flutter_spin> I remember a show doing a Future Version reference, but it was crazy how they set it up.
<alexxm> i might be able to convert my 84 year old granffather into a brony
<Meeplord> SHOE FIGHT!
<CrazyBronyDonut> the day we get a scootaloo-rainbow dash ep is the day my heart explodes and i grab the insulin
<flutter_spin> The past goes into the future and sees everyone broken up in different areas
<Rain> no shoe fights
<Meeplord> ...
<Saske909090> next question cause you dont care
*Rain throws a shoe at Meeplord "no all caps"
<Saske909090> hmmm
<flutter_spin> And the past version does everything she can to get the future ones together again
*Meeplord throws a shoe
<Rain> flutter_spin: that was Teen Titans
<flutter_spin> thats it!
*Saske909090 shows a chubbie
<Saske909090> do you liek chubbies?
<Meeplord> I like cookies..
<flutter_spin> I wanted to know if someone knew the reference
<Tovler> I'm now sufficiently drunk. Should I drive?
<Meeplord> Yes!
<Rain> lol no
<Tovler> 1 yes, 1 no
<flutter_spin> Anyways, that episode of Teen Titans was AWESOME
*Meeplord is a good role model
<Capn_fisty> Tovler: fly a plane
*Saske909090 flys away
<Meeplord> Running low on mtn. dew......crap
<KwakLad> Tovler: please dont drive, fly a plane okay then
<CrazyBronyDonut> Tolver fly a tank
<Tovler> It's funny because it used to be "legal"
*Saske909090 gets mail from derpy
<Saske909090> oh cool
*Meeplord /me /me
<Saske909090> a question from derpy :D
<Saske909090> okay
<Saske909090> ,,Dyou like muffinz"
<derpy_pony> hello everypony
<Saske909090> thats all
<flutter_spin> no.
<CrazyBronyDonut> always
<Jim> ohai derpy_pony
<Meeplord> Zoidburg is best pony
<Saske909090> so nopony likes muffins
*Tovler is still waiting for someone to ponify/derpify the Humpty Dance
<Saske909090> not cool :'(
<CrazyBronyDonut> need a pony reference in more TV shows
<KwakLad> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS213oOPI8Y
<Saske909090> Pikachu dressed as a pony :D
<Meeplord> MAD has made a couple
<Barrel_of_Fun> Hello everypony!
<Tovler> A pokemon that looks like a pony
<Meeplord> BARREL
<Capn_fisty> wonder if there is a OOT/Mjarora's romhack to make epona into one of the mane 6
<Tovler> http://images.serebii.net/poster.jpg
<Meeplord> tl;dr
<Tovler> not sure if want
*flutter_spin is sad not knowing the new pokemon
<derpy_pony> I spent the whole afternoon hunting for blind bags. 12 toy shops. My loot so far: 1 glowing rarity and 1 glowing pinkie pie. If someone told me half a year ago I would ever do something like that...
<Tovler> lol, @ the snowflake pokemons
*Meeplord is dissapointed in modern cartoons
<Jim> I managed to recognise 6 of those pokemon
<BritishBrony|British> Hallo meine freunden.
<derpy_pony> hallo britischer broniker
<CrazyBronyDonut> dry era in animation is dry Meeplord
<BritishBrony|British> :3
<Jim> no wait, 8
<Meeplord> indeedly
<derpy_pony> I have no idea which pokemon is which...never played this game
<flutter_spin> I'm not that determined in the blind bags. I went to Toys R Us, got 4 of the 6 mane, and then left.
<frakturfreak> BritishBrony|British: Hallo meine Freunde, that’s how you say it
<Saske909090> next question
<Barrel_of_Fun> modern cartoons suck, because all kids now like is that !lolranDUMB! stuff....
<BritishBrony|British> Frunden is the plural.
<Saske909090> let me think
<derpy_pony> I went to 3 Toys R Us shops and found nothing...gave up on this chain after that
<Saske909090> do you watch MLP FIM in secret?
<derpy_pony> Freunde is the plural
<Capn_fisty> Not anymore
<Meeplord> http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/
<flutter_spin> yes.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Off to class, later everypone ^_^
<SuperBrony64> 10,02everypony*
<Meeplord> Suddenly nostalgia
<unfoundbug> is there a quiz going on?
<BritishBrony|British> Studied 3 years of the fecking language and I'veforgotten about 80% of it. :3
<CrazyBronyDonut> im open and i recruit people
<Barrel_of_Fun> gj and learn a lot Superbrony64
<CrazyBronyDonut> bye SB
<frakturfreak> BritishBrony|British: I know better than you, for I am German ;)
<Capn_fisty> since my mum found my fluttershy tshirt
<BritishBrony|British> Bye SB!
<KwakLad> bye SB
<flutter_spin> I watch it in secret because I really don't want my Mom watching ANYTHING I do... not when she blabs how "someone didn't have a warrant to enter the house" kind of stuff
<Jim> have fun SB
<BritishBrony|British> Ah.
<Saske909090> but
<Saske909090> i watch it in secret
<derpy_pony> Toys R Us was crazy...this gigantic shelf gorge, in which absolutely everything is pink...where no man has gone before...
<Saske909090> cause my brother is a hater
<Saske909090> he hates MLP FIM
<unfoundbug> the only person that knows i watch that show is my flatmate
<CrazyBronyDonut> i have converted 25 people so far ^^
<unfoundbug> he is relentless about mocking me for it
<Meeplord> ive converted 0
*Saske909090 hates haters
<Meeplord> only 2 peeps know im a brony
<Barrel_of_Fun> mlp isn't something you need to convert others to...
<rainbowdash002> converted 1
<Saske909090> kay next
<unfoundbug> getting him to watch an episode just gave him more ammunition
<Capn_fisty> I dont mind being made fun of for watching, as long as its in a way that i can join in
<Saske909090> did you played game ,,GO FAST"
<flutter_spin> I pretty much told everybody once. Nobody wanted to hear those words again from me, but they dont "hate" MLP
<CrazyBronyDonut> im pretty well known at my college though so that may be why
<PinkieSpice> why is there a ad?
<flutter_spin> They would have felt the same way if I told people I love pokemon.
*Meeplord shrugs
<PinkieSpice> ...
<PinkieSpice> evil tricking add
<PinkieSpice> ad*
<Saske909090> *cough* spikehascrushonrarity *cough*
<flutter_spin> Adblock :P
<PinkieSpice> have it
<Meeplord> FOORRREEEEVVVEERRRR
<Saske909090> hey guys
<PinkieSpice> using it
<Capn_fisty> Saske909090: GODDAMNIT spoilertags next time
<CrazyBronyDonut> wassup
<PinkieSpice> no idea why it's not working
<Saske909090> ever played game called GO FAST
<CrazyBronyDonut> yep
<unfoundbug> 'fraid now
<flutter_spin> on EQD? yes
<unfoundbug> not*
<unfoundbug> oh wait
<CrazyBronyDonut> fluff :)
<Meeplord> Ever play pong?
<unfoundbug> that spacebar destroying monster?
<Meeplord> :)
<Saske909090> http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/591002
<flutter_spin> Plasma Pong :P
<PinkieSpice> Saske909090: go break your spacebar. :U
<Saske909090> i did won this game ^^
<Saske909090> and my spacebar didnt break
<Paradise92> http://9gag.com/gag/3057025
<Paradise92> :D
<Paradise92> this is
<Capn_fisty> i nearly did but then my arm tired out
<Paradise92> me
<Barrel_of_Fun> i like how mike made a cameo at the begining of the flash :)
<Saske909090> fluffy is soooo cute :3
<Barrel_of_Fun> YES Sasje909090
*Saske909090 hugs chubbie derpy
<flutter_spin> Sadly Paradise, my friends don't have time for me anymore
<Capn_fisty> its a shame 'cause my fluffy drowned
<flutter_spin> They all got married, full time jobs, and got kids.
<Saske909090> next question
<Saske909090> your reaction on derpy talking?
<flutter_spin> you asked that already
<Saske909090> nop
<Saske909090> i asked
<Saske909090> you reaction to derpy
<Barrel_of_Fun> flufflepuff's bad end scenes are so heart tearing ;_;
<Saske909090> :D
<BritishBrony|British> Anyway, I better do my Homework othernow or it will be like this: *Get up at 2am, do homework rubishly, not go back to sleep, wait until 3am to go on this chatroom merely to say 'oh boy, 3am' and fall asleep in history- thus getting after school detentions for the rest of my life.
<unfoundbug> fairly standard reaction, mostly omg, and speechless
<flutter_spin> Didn't know it was derpy until she spoke
<Saske909090> what AJ means in MLP FIM?
<Saske909090> so quiet
<Saske909090> ...
<flutter_spin> I guess it's a typical response to anyone who didn't know who Derpy is before that episode
<Ingwaz> aj = applejack
*BritishBrony|British is definitely not here.
<Ingwaz> just as RD = rainbow dash
<Saske909090> yea
*Rain hugs Shizuka
<Saske909090> what would you do if pinkamena would kidnap you?
<Saske909090> quiet again...
<unfoundbug> no idea reallly
*BritishBrony|British does not approve
<unfoundbug> a) yay id be in equestria
<Capn_fisty> try not to remember *that*
<Ingwaz> Saske909090: this sounds like its heading towards the unmentionable fic again, we do not mention it at all
<unfoundbug> b) pinkamena is scary as
<Saske909090> i kno
<Saske909090> THIS DO NOT MENTION FANFIC
<Saske909090> FOR PETE SAKE
<BritishBrony|British> SUBJECT CHAAAAAAAAAAAAANGE
<Ingwaz> =.= -caps please
<unfoundbug> easy on the canterlot voice
<Ingwaz> indeed, do you have billy mays syndrome?
<Saske909090> next...
<Saske909090> if you would have wings what would you do?
<Capn_fisty> fly
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2bcWav9Mn0&t=10m18s RD calls Applejack AJ
<BritishBrony|British> Fly.
<Saske909090> aaand
<unfoundbug> fly to the moon and rescue luna
<Saske909090> yup
<Saske909090> nextttt...
<Saske909090> do you want to live in ponyville?
<BritishBrony|British> Sure.
<Saske909090> guys?
<Capn_fisty> Fo sho
<BritishBrony|British> That's me!
<PinkieSpice> nope~
<Saske909090> why not
<flutter_spin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYBlLnfjaXw&t=8m50s AJ calls Rainbow Dash RD
<PinkieSpice> too orderly~
<Saske909090> next shall be
<PinkieSpice> I rather live in everfree forest~
<unfoundbug> i dont think i would leave if i ended up there, but i wouldnt actively try to get there
<Saske909090> do you like mmmmmmmmmmm bananas?
*unfoundbug runs
<Saske909090> celestia asked :P
<PinkieSpice> no opinion
<Saske909090> i love asking :#
<Capn_fisty> Maybe, i dunno
<Saske909090> kay next
*PinkieSpice runs away*
<Saske909090> muffinz or cupcakes?
<PinkieSpice> no opinion
<Capn_fisty> Muffinz is best always
<unfoundbug> considering my rather large stockpile, muffins :d
<Saske909090> muffinz won
<unfoundbug> buy one get one free and the shop on the way back, so i bought 16
<Saske909090> next shall be
<TrixieMuffin> Success ! I just retrieved a perfect Coke from the fridge! Chilled to just the right degree where little ice particle are floating in it . HEAVEN!
<Saske909090> do you have guts to meet molestia?
<Capn_fisty> ah man there is a cofee place that does these apple and cinnamon muffins
<unfoundbug> yes
<flutter_spin> I do not accept Molestia as real
*Saske909090 runz
<Capn_fisty> is like the best thing ever
<Saske909090> MOLESTIA
<Saske909090> GTF
<unfoundbug> flutter_spin, its a what-if style question, if she was real, would you be able to meet her
*Saske909090 is angry
<Saske909090> eghgh
<Saske909090> next
<flutter_spin> No, I mean that my brain only accepts Celestia. No way can I picture her as Molestia
<unfoundbug> understandable
<Dashie_Dashie> If molestia was real, she better be ready.
<flutter_spin> The same applies to Derpy and the new voice. I can't accept that either.
<Saske909090> do you hate my brother(he hates MLP FIM)
<Saske909090> cause i do :P
<Saske909090> and last(cause my brother wants my PC)
<Capn_fisty> actually hate or just doesnt like
<Saske909090> did you liked my question game?
<Saske909090> he hates
<flutter_spin> More Luna!
<Saske909090> HATEZ
<Saske909090> did you liked my question game?(again)

<Ingwaz> yo Meanwhile
<Iwubponiez> hi and happy derpy day :)
<Inquisitor> eh, the only anime I've watched for a long long time was Fate Zero and that's not had any new episodes in a while
<BritishBrony|British> Cya.
<unfoundbug> hiya LC
<Meanwhile> How are we all?
<Inquisitor> BritishBrony I've not finished Revil4 yet, I probably should
<LordCelestia> 0,5How is everypony?
<Sumica> 00,10Heya LC

<Iwubponiez> LC muufffiiiiiiiiiiins
<LordCelestia> 0,5Hiya Sumica
<Shizuka> 13sumica... you asked where i was at 5am... i would be sleeping of course....
<Meanwhile> Shizuka: but you don't sleep.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh hai ~ Good afternoon everypne ~
<unfoundbug> im good, how are you this fine evening
<Shizuka> 13i sleep like the dead..
<Jim> ohai TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Sumica> 00,10then you missed shirtless jamie Shizuka <3
<Inquisitor> I like revil 4, leaps and bounds better than any other revil game I've played, with only revelations as the exception
<Shizuka> 13:<
<alexxm> i'm good
<unfoundbug> hiya TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Meanwhile> Allo TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<BritishBrony|British> I'm probably getting a full night of sleep tonight too, so goodbye for today.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> also happy derpy day i guess ~
<Erebus> I dont think i will be able to sleep tonight.
<Meanwhile> http://i.imgur.com/afxiG.png
<unfoundbug> BritishBrony|British, its not even 9pm, seriously bed already?
<Capn_fisty> RE4 is only RE game I have played.
<Dumorimasoddaa> Derpy day ist best day
<Iwubponiez> ^
<Jim> so true
<BritishBrony|British> RE4 is great, Revelations is amazing.
<otakon> Shizuka!
*otakon hugs Shizuka
<Meanwhile> I'll probably try to sleep but I doubt I'll be able to.
<otakon> hiya Sumica what's up?
<Inquisitor> I've got a friend who loves the games... I always prefered Silent Hill, but Revil 4 and Revelations are the ones that I actually like enough to compare to Silent Hill
<BritishBrony|British> And I said it, I'm not going to bed now. I'm going to play RE4.
<BritishBrony|British> :3
<Sumica> 00,10Dreading going in to work today.
<otakon> Sumica: why?
<Dumorimasoddaa> Even if I've spent all of today traveling, and looking after kinder
<otakon> dat was PERFECT
<Jim> trolled
<Midnight_Tempest> lol
<unfoundbug> Sumica how come?
<Ingwaz> why Sumica ?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ohh FMA ~
<otakon> poor bastard
<Sumica> 00,10cause I am exausted, this is day 7 in a row
<Inquisitor> then the birds blows up
<unfoundbug> ouch, no weekend break?
<otakon> Sumica: y u no sleep?
<Meanwhile> Harsh.
<Scavender> Well, Good Night everypony. See ya all tomorrow.
<Starflash> Sumi you're still doing this? o_o
<Ingwaz> yeah...thatll do it Sumica
<Midnight_Tempest> i know the fell Sumica
<unfoundbug> g'night
<Meanwhile> Night Scavender
<Sumica> 00,10oh I sleep but I have been working my arse off.
<Inquisitor> what's with the "WHOAAAAA!!!!"
<Starflash> lots of respect, in any case.
<Jim> night Scavender
<Erebus> anyone else hearing a random "WOAHHHH" every min or so?
<Jim> The WOAHHH is the ping of sumica
<Onyxiaz> i wrote the whole thing.. ic
<Erebus> ok now i feel like a fool :/
<Inquisitor> hehe, funny ping
<otakon> Sumica: well I know of that feeling and inb4 WOAH!
<otakon> Erebus: it's Sumica's ping
<Capn_fisty> Heh 15 ish seconds of lag between chat and my stream
<CCCP> so we will never get derpy back?
<Meanwhile> Derpy didn't go anywhere.
<Ingwaz> CCCP: derpy was changed for that one episode only
<Iwubponiez> derpy never left silly filly
<Sumica> 00,10the change was only for that ep.
<Iwubponiez> she will still derp
<CCCP> Ingwaz: so her eyes will still be the same?
<Onyxiaz> there will may be some changes with her voice or her name.. but derpy will stay in the show
<Inquisitor> derpy's just not called by name and they uncrossed her eyes and redubbed her
<Ingwaz> if shes ever given a speaking voice, she'll most likely get the female voice that she was originally intended to have, and she most likely will not get the canon name derpy, but her eyes should remain the same
<Iwubponiez> cccp yes
<Jim> Derpy's gonna derp
<otakon> made out of the guys under Marcoh
<Iwubponiez> she will derp in future episode
<Inquisitor> Ingwaz if ya watch the edit of the episode she's underped
<Iwubponiez> but they never call her derpy anymore :'(
<Iwubponiez> we still call her derpy
<Ingwaz> most likely, if she is given a name, it will be ditzy doo
<Meanwhile> They only called her Derpy once anyway. Is it really that big a deal
<Ingwaz> Inquisitor: she was mostly underped, not all the way
<prince-dari> So I'm wondering, are they never going to put Derpy in episodes with derped eyes past this point again?
<Iwubponiez> that episode only
<Jim> "Well I stole your face"
<prince-dari> Because that kind of sucks.
<Meanwhile> No they probably just won't name her again.
<otakon> hiya prince-dari, yh me too
<Phase4> good morning, i got work to do so ding me if you need me
<Ingwaz> prince-dari: they should continue to have her with derped eyes to my knowledge
<prince-dari> Hey otakon
<Midnight_Tempest> they will prince-dari... they only changed her for the one episode
<Iwubponiez> i am 99% sure she will derp
<Sumica> 00,10they said no change to her eyes past this ep, but time will tell
<CCCP> Derpy was in Hearts and Hooves day
<Inquisitor> yea prince-dari I hope they don't derp her eyes, that's kinda the defining characteristic
<Ingwaz> everything they've said indicates that it was only for the last round up, not for any other eps
<prince-dari> Yeah, they also denied that anything was being changed with Derpy to start with.
<Jim> We'll just have to pay extra attention during the next episode to see if she's there
<Iwubponiez> cccp: WHERE?!
<prince-dari> And look how that turned out.
<Sumica> 00,10seeing as all the eps were already made by this point any ways
<Ingwaz> prince-dari: i dont remember an actual denial that was verifiable
<otakon> prince-dari: yeah, hey you want to know something neat?
<prince-dari> Yeah?
<otakon> prince-dari: one of the Sentai rangers uses the TARDIS sound effect
<otakon> I forget which though
<Inquisitor> ha
<CCCP> Iwubponiez: she is hidden in the background with Dr Whooves. Its in one of the parts where u see Ponyville from a birds eye veiw right after the cmc sing
<Meanwhile> I'm not sure whether that's depressing or not.
<prince-dari> HAH, awesome.
<Iwubponiez> cccp: oh forgot that for a min
<otakon> hmmm
<Iwubponiez> she was in a friend in deed to
<Iwubponiez> too
<otakon> I don't like this intro tbh
<CCCP> Did they put her with dr whooves for us?
<Midnight_Tempest> prince-dari: on another Dr. Who note... fallout new vegas makes a referance to the Vashta Nerada in one of the DLC's
<Ingwaz> prince-dari: the main reason she was changed in the last round up is due to the word "derp" being treated as a slur for "mentally retarded"
<otakon> prince-dari: The Library to be specific "
<Meanwhile> What's steaming? Because I was already watching something else when I loaded chat up.
<otakon> Who turned out the lights?"
<Ingwaz> it was not her eyes, unfortunately it was just a perfect storm of 3 factors, but the name derpy was the biggest
<xles> http://graphjam.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/funny-graphs-why-i-am-interested-in-the-multiverse-theory.jpg
<prince-dari> That's cool
<prince-dari> Dr Who references. Me gusta. :>
<otakon> indeed xles
<otakon> dat panda
<Thunderpony> lol
<Inquisitor> I've never thought derp ment retarded I always thought it ment an embarassing mistake
<CCCP> xles: yes
<Thunderpony> I'm in the green
<otakon> it's just a cat
<Ingwaz> xles: suddenly i'm interested the multiverse theory
<otakon> Sumica: the animation is looser in this one
<xles> =D
<Onyxiaz> well i thing they wont make any changes... or choose 4 option...
<String_Shredder> run forset run!
<String_Shredder> *forest
<Ingwaz> and Inquisitor to many it does not, but to a small few it does, and hasbro did not want to use a character name that could be used as a slur for mental retardation
<Iwubponiez> P.S The word "derpy" got no defination in the dictonary
<Sumica> 00,10creepy old man in drag
<KwakLad> creepy
<Ingwaz> i cannot blame them for that
<Onyxiaz> check urban dictionary
<Iwubponiez> look it up , not found
<Meanwhile> What are you lot watching?
<String_Shredder> thats a legit old lady
<CCCP> derpy is not in dictonary.com
<Iwubponiez> or my dictonary book
<Inquisitor> derp probably is though
<alexxm> what is this
<Jim> Because that's Sweetie Belle
<KwakLad> kitty :p
<Iwubponiez> no derp isn't there
<Iwubponiez> go see
<CCCP> alexxm: is 12 and what is this?
<alexxm> what show is this
<Onyxiaz> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=derpy
<Inquisitor> derp was coined by south park with making fun of rob schnider's movies... hence another reason I took it to mean "embarassing mistake"
<Onyxiaz> here
<otakon> Inquisitor: makes sense
<Sumica> 00,10It's Full metal alchemist
<otakon> Brotherhood
<alexxm> ok thanks
<alexxm> how far in are we
<otakon> and then he blows up the map
<CCCP> Onyxiaz: 3 defintition says it means "retarted"
<Midnight_Tempest> can we stop talking about Derpy... its really getting on my nerves...
<Sumica> 00,10ep 32
<otakon> alexxm: about half way through the series
<Ingwaz> indeed, its sad but in some ways, it is used to mean retarded, so i do not blame them for the change
<Ingwaz> i am torn on whether or not they should give her the name ditzy doo as they originally intended though
<otakon> Ditzy is no better
<alexxm> ok is it just me or does the guy in the white suite looking like rossiu
<Ingwaz> it might anger the fans, or they might take it as a nod and attempted apology to the fandom
<otakon> alexxm: enope
<Inquisitor> sorry Midnight_Tempest but my Soap Box instinct against censorship of any kind sometimes is too strong for me
<Ingwaz> otakon, being ditzy isnt something thats like mental retardation
<Meanwhile> I reckon Ditzy is probably a lot better.
<Meanwhile> Since Derpy apparently means retarded and Ditzy means spacey, and the like.
<String_Shredder> dude looks like a lady
<CCCP> They should just keep Derpy as a character thats in the background with no lines
<Inquisitor> lady IS a dude
<otakon> Still
<otakon> Derpy is what we made of it
<otakon> it didn't HAVE to mean retarded
<Jim> Guys, call Professor Oak, he needs to solve this
<Ingwaz> indeed otakon, and to the fans, she will always be derpy
<otakon> but it ended up going that route
<otakon> damn, he creepy
<CCCP> brb
<Ingwaz> and you're arguing the subjective end of word usage, a word never has to be anything, but htere are values that people assign to it
<Ingwaz> its sad, i dont like it completely, but i understand why they did it, so i respect it
<otakon> Ingwaz: eeyup, most people interpret it as "clumsy" not "retarded"
<otakon> yet the minority that take it as "retarded" got their way.
<Coolbluemidnite> is video working for you guys?
<otakon> eeyup
<RaveBrony> Oh cool! FMA!!
<KwakLad> yes Coolbluemidnite
<otakon> Coolbluemidnite: refresh you foal
<RaveBrony> ^
<otakon> Lt. General Grumann
<Jim> Mwuhahaha
<Meanwhile> In fairness though the people who're offended by the name aren't really part of the fandom.
<Coolbluemidnite> -evil laugh-
<otakon> Meanwhile: yh
<Ingwaz> Meanwhile: some of them are, you cannot concretely say none of them are
<Onyxiaz> i gotta leave... cya all
<otakon> damn
<Capn_fisty> ugh, hate my g;asses
<Inquisitor> the last thing I'll say about this whole Derpy thing... What kind of people would take it to the corporation to change something like this? I mean you have to read it, interpret it, and discuss it to come to the worst possible conclusion and yet people thing it's obvious enough for other people to instantly get their line of logic to be offended... it makes not sense to me, not only that is that the state of affairs in the us
<otakon> bye Onyxiaz come back soon
<Inquisitor> sorry for wall of text
<Jim> Panda
<kenne> hai guys
<Coolbluemidnite> What we watching? :3
<Ingwaz> and the problem is not that it was a minority that complained, the problem is that the word derp is recognized by enough people to not mean clumsy but mentally retarded
<Jim> Full Metal Alchemist
<Coolbluemidnite> mmk tyuh
<otakon> Ingwaz: yeah, so we change the meaning of the word back?
<kenne> oh cool fullmetal
<Sumica> 00,10Suddnly armstrong
<otakon> WE MUST RECLAIM DERPY!
<KwakLad> sparkles
<Midnight_Tempest> sparkles!
<otakon> damn
<Jim> Manly Armstrong is manly
<KwakLad> lol
<Ingwaz> otakon: best get to it if thats your plan
<otakon> HOLY SHIT
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> derpy is derpy to me that is not going to change ~ topic is getting boring ~
<otakon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: same here
<PartyCannon> TheGreatAndPowerfulT indeed
<Coolbluemidnite> Derpy is the best thing since toilet roll
<otakon> I LOVE how Armstrong gets more screen time in this
<Iwubponiez> stop talk about the derpy problem and EAT A MUFFIN
<Erebus> Why didnt he just walk around? i guess going through bookcases must be on his bucketlist

*emangamer is so friggen confused
<otakon> emangamer: they CANT its a fixed point
<Derping> whre can i haz adbloc 6_9
<StickySyrup> emangamer: just cause
<Snuffsis> emangamer: Because that would be interfering with the proper timeline
<alexxm> firefox
<Meanwhile> emangamer: Wibbley wobbley timey wimey.
<Snuffsis> emangamer: he would see himself and everything.
<emangamer> Snuffsis: havne't they already fucked with the timeline
<prince-dari> Dat double killcam gamewinner
<prince-dari> :P
<otakon> emangamer: it would cause a paradox and destroy existence
<PinkiePieCopy> What Snuffis says is true.
<Snuffsis> emangamer: no, because according to the timeline that was supposed to happen from that spaceship and everything.
<emangamer> otakon: not if he travels to a different time...right
<otakon> emangamer: no, bc he can't do it.
<Derping> dear doctor: i have crabs...
<emangamer> bleh...
<StickySyrup> Derping: hahah
<Snuffsis> emangamer: the doctor has a very important rule to NEVER go to a timeline he has visited once before.
<RaveBrony> Fail
<Derping> lol
<StickySyrup> Derping: get yourself checked
<emangamer> Snuffsis: but it's all one timeline
<Snuffsis> He did that once in season 1 with Rose, and it almost ended the universe
<RoflBot> what we watching?
<Derping> StickySyrup but i haz no crabs i haz lobster
<Jim> Doctor Who
<RoflBot> AWESOME
<PinkiePieCopy> Derping: Gordan Freeman: Headcrabs?
<Erebus> this is doctor who?
<Waffles> i want some lobster..
<otakon> emangamer: think of it this way, it's all ONE timeline but he can't intersect his OWN timeline
<Vinyl> ;~;
<StickySyrup> one of the best series out there
<PinkiePieCopy> Omg yes police box
<Derping> yes headcrabs StickySyrup
<Snuffsis> emangamer: Yes, but seeing oneself and interacting with that timeline could/would cause a paradox.
<RaveBrony> O.o
<otakon> dat picture
<PinkiePieCopy> I didn't ask headcrabs
<Meanwhile> One does not simply crab a head.
<DeadlyDerp3> SATALITE OF LOVE
<otakon> damn it that music is so friggin sad
<Snuffsis> emangamer: Rose did that in season 1, and it almost destroyed the timeline. :P

<flutter_spin> Remind me again what Dr. Who is about?
<alexxm> old version i think
<RAWRity> Just made an amazing technological breakthrough? Better show it to the British.
<Snuffsis> Because he has a rule to never cross his own timeline, that i know.
<KernelCobb> yea, Jim, check it out on minecraftforum.net
<Snuffsis> alexxm: aah, that explains it then. :P
<RAWRity> Snuffsis: no, it's old Classic Who
<RAWRity> It was during the 5th Doctor's run.
<Snuffsis> Aww mickey...
<Snuffsis> T_T
<emangamer> flutter_spin: oh your mind will be so fucked.....
<Jim> Explosions!
<RAWRity> It's akin to the Team Up episodes they had every season in Power Rangers
<flutter_spin> I heard Dr. Who is way beyond awesome weird
<Pinkamena> LOOK OUT HERE COMES TOM
<Meanwhile> flutter_spin: wibbley wobbley timey wimey
<String_Shredder> directed by Michael Bay
<StinkomanFan> SCIENCE
<Snuffsis> rawrity: i tried watching doctor who from the very start, but gosh darnit, i don't have enough free time for that. xD
<StinkomanFan> Fiction
<Snuffsis> And black and white, not really a fan of that haha
<flutter_spin> Tell me, can it be compared to Sliders?

<Jim> She's dead
<RoboGerbil> esplosions
<Starflash> JIM

<emangamer> its dead, jim
<Jim> wait...Are you trying to tell me it's dead?
<String_Shredder> R.I.P the TARDIS
<Meanwhile> emangamer: I've got a newsflash for you. Time is wimey, there is no alternate line.
<Starflash> Yes Jim
<RAWRity> Snuffsis: well, you really CAN'T watch it from the start. Most of the First 2 doctors' episodes were destroyed or lost.
<DeadlyDerp3> Were in Camp Nowhere :P
<Vinyl> haha
<Starflash> Its worse than that, Its Windows, Jim =w=
<StinkomanFan> And then they start the canniblism
<otakon> RAWRity: really? damn that sucks
<Jim> I knew I shouldn't have left it out in the first place...

<StinkomanFan> OH THE HUMANITY
<Waffles> WOAH!!!!
<Vinyl> I wish we still had that...
<KernelCobb> that phonebooth location is completely inconspicuous
<PinkiePieCopy> Does anyone know a free image editor that is not GIMP?
<flutter_spin> FRINGE.. I mean wut?
<RAWRity> Snuffsis: every episode that's survived perhaps, but there's big chunks missing through a lot of em.
<Jim> amirite?
<RoboGerbil> steampunk
<String_Shredder> StinkomanFan: i see what you did there
<RoflBot> Gimp 3.6
<alexxm> but still Snuffis i gave 2 examples of the doctor deblitaly creating a paradox
<Vinyl> <3 steampunk
*String_Shredder thinks about it
<DeadlyDerp3> Rose: "my dad is alive...Woopee"
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I prfer Steam Boy
<RAWRity> otakon: that's how the BBC operated back them. Show an episode once, then burn that celluloid like it's going out of style.
<StinkomanFan> So... her father started Zeplins?
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03prefer*
<Snuffsis> Rawrity: Maybe, but still, the first episodes survived atleast. :P
<String_Shredder> trust me!
<Jim> I'm the doctor
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Trust me, I be a doctor!
*Scoot-Scootaloo menacing voice
<RaveBrony> :'(
*String_Shredder remembers The Wall's "Trust Us" thingy
<Pinkamena> ...I was about to stay that Scootaloo.
<Meanwhile> Scoot-Scootaloo: stay away from my prostate.
<KernelCobb> I've never really watched this show, but i'm guessing Derpy Hooves represents Rose?
<flutter_spin> I'm an advertisement, not a doctor
<Pinkamena> /ninja'd
<Vinyl> Trust me on this I'm on an ad
<RoflBot> DAT CAR

<Snuffsis> emangamer: No, there are only alternative universes where there are different versions of humans and such.
<RoflBot> I said Gimp 2.6
<Jim> They spelled Princess Celestia wrong
<Snuffsis> Multiverse theory, if you ever heard of it?
<RoflBot> 6_9

*Painis_Cupcake eats StinkomanFan
<Capn_fisty> dat hummong
<flutter_spin> Or her mom had... uh, nevermind
<KernelCobb> StinkomanFan: or simply they didn't have a daughter, and subconsciously named a dog rose
<StinkomanFan> :|
<Capn_fisty> humming*
<DeadlyDerp3> "ACting, LIke...I HAVE...Stick up my ASS"
<flutter_spin> whoa!

<mario_pony> alexxm: just got back from school
*flutter_spin trying his best to follow a weird show he's never seen before.
<mario_pony> gotta refresh
<emangamer> so, that means there is another TARDIS right?
<StinkomanFan> Shut up Mickey
<Jim> it doesn't have to
<flutter_spin> Or it could be the SIDRAT
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03Remember... No Russian
<Snuffsis> Not necessarily.
<Jim> there was no Rose, remember
<emangamer> flutter_spin: touche
<Meanwhile> TARDIS is forever alone.
<Snuffsis> In that alternative universe, maybe.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03inb4 steampunk
<emangamer> ^
<Snuffsis> Since it would mean there is an alternate doctor, but it's also a chance the doctor never stole the TARDIS in that universe and so on.
*flutter_spin instantly reminded of Bioshock: Infinite
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03^
<RoflBot> yup
<StinkomanFan> In an alternate reality we all have pones, think about that for a moment
<SuperBrony64> Awesome! They postponed the big update to the PSN until a later Dat :D
<Jim> Old phone is suddenly High definition
<SuperBrony64> Date*
<DeadlyDerp3> "And my mind, is AWESOME...J-just like PUDDING"
