<PinkySpice> brb
<RAWRity> It's definitely clear that the new voice was done very quickly, with no thought to acting. The voice itself is okay but...the VA obviously wasn't getting anything from the director.
<Dynamic_Brony> dos eyes

<RaveBrony> Woah, ive never seen Cowboy bebop this nice before O.O (my comp screen is nicer than my tv)

<parallellogic|dA> Martial Arts is a metaphor for Friendship
<Lunarletic> yep

<Lunarletic> definitely
<Waffles> *clap clap*
<Sumica> 00,10so I take it you all want more.
<RAWRity> But yea, Tovler's right. The "my bad" line sounds like she's almost mocking RD about it.
<Darf14> Si
<otakon> um yes plz?
<Waffles> YES
<Solargirl> Of course Sumica ^^
*yay
<Colt_Magnum> MOAR COWBOY BEEBOP

<Jaketehsnake> Seriously, How are all of you happy during a crysis such as this?
<otakon> hiya yay
<Zappy> *applauds*
<AttackWithHugs> Anybody listen to Akeboshi?
<RAWRity> This is gonna turn into a "Han Shot First" kinda thing, isn't it?
<Dynamic_Brony> whats the sound for ponies clapping
<Darf14> yay
<Colt_Magnum> u hear me Sumica?! MOAR BEEBOP!
<Everlasting_Joy> All right, I'm going to head off folks. Despite the bad news, thanks for making my night.
<otakon> Jaketehsnake: we have to be, bc worrying about it will do us no good.
<Lunarletic> Whats the sound of one hand clapping?
<Kencolt> Well, okay, Sumi.... since I know you don't have one of my all time faves.
<Waffles> i heard a yay
<parallellogic|dA> yey
<Sumica> 00,10Jake, cause we all kind said all we have to say, and it's only itunes version.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Night Everlasting_Joy sleep Well
<Solargirl> Not to mention, worrying about it is silly.
<otakon> Jaketehsnake: we just move on, and it's not the end of the world or the fandom
<otakon> it's just really disappointing is all
<Jaketehsnake> Ah, I missed the disctussion then. Ah. Carry on
<Everlasting_Joy> Thanks TheGreatAndPowerfulT.
<otakon> Sumica: thanks for the stream man
<Solargirl> It's one small thing which will just stay like that. "A small thing"
<Lunarletic> woohoo
<Buytoast> Besides, she was called Derpy in the original version, so it will be remmbered as such. No amount of butt hurt whining can change that fact.
<Waffles> i think im gonna get addicted watching this
<Zappy> Whatever happens to Derpy, the show will still keep it's awesomeness.
<Dynamic_Brony> dat intro
<parallellogic|dA> wha'ts this about a blow to the fandom?
<RAWRity> ...WHO NEEDS THIS MUCH LUBE? http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Natural-Water-Based-Lubricant-Gallon/dp/B005MR3IVO/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1330036229&sr=1-1
<Tovler> that one fan voice for derpy is still the best.
<otakon> RAWRity: I believe so
<Darf14> as the old saying goes, the show must go on
<Lunarletic> even though I have VHS and the remastered I like watching it on your stream!
<parallellogic|dA> the iTunes ep came back...?
<Sumica> 00,10what show is that Kencolt?
<Solargirl> Peolple are overacting because RD no longer says "Derpy"
<otakon> Tovler: you mean Balddumborat? yh, her fan voice sounds right
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No-one should go apeshit over the Derpy thing. It'll only shed a bad light on bronies in general.
<Waffles> *sigh*
<Phase4> parallellogic|dA: they modified the ep
<Dynamic_Brony> That sucks
<Jaketehsnake> Parallel the itunes ep came back with a cesored derpy with a different voice and no derpy eyes
<CriticKitten> ....ugh.
<Kencolt> Why, Sailor Moon, of course. And yes, I am serious.
<parallellogic|dA> O_o
<Tovler> I'm strangely obsessed with vats of lube.
<otakon> RAWRity: an elephant and ant couple
<RAWRity> guys, can I ask a question? WHO NEEDS THIS MUCH LUBE? WHO? http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Natural-Water-Based-Lubricant-Gallon/dp/B005MR3IVO/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1330036229&sr=1-1

*AttackWithHugs applauds Nittany_Discord until my her hands hurt
<otakon> Sumica: indeed
<HappyFace> When they go out of their way to kill our fandom, thats where the love and toleration needs to end.
<Sumica> 00,10Hub version is unchanged
<Buytoast> Is it just me, or does the redone Derpy scne Rainbow Dash sound a bit off?
<otakon> and now here comes the ass kicking
<Phase4> D

<Dynamic_Brony> Why Hasbro?
<RAWRity> "Every house in america needs this lube. We use it for everything. It is not only fun for my boyfriend and I, but it is fun for the whole family. You would think this is a life time supply, but ours only last about 6 months, but we use it a lot. The dogs love it too."
<Waffles> really?!!

<Ponibas> I think that JUST died down
<Darf14> *hugs SB64* we all know :(
<yay> you can put it on your checklist
<unfoundbug> it really had as well
<Buytoast> Oh SuperBrony64, you and your opening of a can of worms.
<Waffles> umm im getting laggs
<Dynamic_Brony> Go T GO
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> and bummed again
<SteveCharb> twilight x checklist is now my favorite ship
<unfoundbug> sb you just woke a hornets nest it takes AGES to calm it back down
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Why would they do that ;____;
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: we're not talking about that right now. We're talking about an amazon page where you can buy 55 gallons of Lube.
<GabeMoist> Ohai :3
<Sumica> 00,10SB dont jump the gun, it's only itunes version
<Darf14> look on the brightsides, only the itunes was affected
<QuidProBrony> They cant delete my recording of the original episode so :P
<yay> I miss 6_6
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: we've been discussing it for a while now, only the itunes version afaik . dvd's and hubwold versions are unchnaged
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But they also said was the episode on TV as well
<Waffles> what happened i just refreshed
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm downloading both seasons at this moment.
<Sumica> 00,10It's EQD saying it SB.
<Dashie_Dashie> torrents ftw
<Sumica> 00,10you know the place that said Tom curse is a brony.
*Phase4 has a copy of the orig backed up
<Buytoast> EQD is never wrong though!
<GabeMoist> Tom Curse
<Buytoast> Except about that one ponychan thread about season 3.
<unfoundbug> 1080p backups on several different storage mecahnisms
<Buytoast> And Tom Cruise.
<Mutterguy> Cruise methinks
*GabeMoist has been cursed by Tom Curse
<QuidProBrony> why did they change derpy back to Ditsy Doo?
<Phase4> multiple people on ponychat have purchased it and are complaining to itune
<Waffles> tiny human
<Ponibas> is that like Mummy's Curse?
<Phase4> itunes'
<GabeMoist> Derpy is Derpy
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: don't despair! We have THIS to cheer us up! http://www.amazon.com/Passion-Natural-Water-Based-Lubricant-Gallon/product-reviews/B005MR3IVO/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending
<unfoundbug> lol, the lube convo again
<Dynamic_Brony> Good thing I have the original episode
<GabeMoist> That's all there is too it
<Darf14> Tom Cruse is not a brony?! Everything I know is a lie! :(
<Tovler> No, Derpy, just doesn't have a name.
<Dashie_Dashie> Once I download both torrents of season 1 and 2, I'm moving them to my xbox FOR DOUBLE THE FUN!
<Golakka> As a Fertility Specialist for Pachyderms, this was exactly what we needed to help rebuild elephant populations all over sub-saharan africa. It's not all just Medications and IVF treatments. Some times you need a loudspeaker, a Barry White CD and a 55 Gallon drum of Lube.
<Zappy> RAWRity: LUBRICANT!!!
<SteveCharb> that was tara strong just trolling
<unfoundbug> you got to the point of going through the reviews?
<RAWRity> Golakka: posted that already.
<yay> when an elephant loves a pig
<Golakka> daw
<Bluestrom_S> WTH MAN
<Sumica> 00,10indeed it was SteveCharb
<Tovler> Ignore Rawrity and look at this instead: http://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Three-Wolf-Short-Sleeve/product-reviews/B002HJ377A/ref=cm_cr_pr_btm_link_next_2?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=0&pageNumber=2&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending
<Waffles> weeeeeeeeeee
<QuidProBrony> derpy was actually was gonna be a pony named Ditsy Doo
<Sumica> 00,10and it was reported as fact.
<Dashie_Dashie> that link..
<Bluestrom_S> why did they change her?
<RAWRity> Tovler: that shirt's old hat. 55 Gallons of Lube is the new 3 wolf moon shirt.
<SteveCharb> PC nazis
<QuidProBrony> Cause Trolling
<Waffles> they need to make up there mind!!!
<Lunarletic> butthi
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity, did you go looking for the lube on purpose?
<Lunarletic> butthurt?
<Dynamic_Brony> MAN. I got a science fair project due next week.
<Ponibas> rofl.. omg the reviews
<yay> They felt it wasn't edgy enough. They wanted to show a pony intentionally destroy a building
<Dynamic_Brony> And I am here!!11
<Darf14> Mythbusters, always makes science fun
<RAWRity> AttackWithHugs: somebody I follow on twitter posted the link, saying "WHY? WHO NEEDS THIS MUCH LUBE?" and the rest was history.
<yay> it looked accidental in the previous episode
<QuidProBrony> Dynamic_Brony just make something from this show lul
<Dynamic_Brony> f*** THE LUBE
<Tovler> There's like 500 new pages of "new" Wolfshirt reviews. Old hat? I think not.
<Dynamic_Brony> lol
<Dynamic_Brony> Thats is wat I thought
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Why would they change the iTunes episode and nothing else though?
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity: aaah. But still, that's a shit-ton of tube. I shouldn't chafe anymore then.
<RAWRity> Tovler: but it's all the same thing "Oh, i'm fat and this shirt made me a sexy bitch"
<Sumica> 00,10Apple covering there asses
<bartsonic> gasp mythbusters is on here and i nearly missed it
<YourLittleDashie> TOO LOUDDD
<unfoundbug> SuperBrony64 because apple are covering thier asses
<YourLittleDashie> I suggested it LOL
<Dynamic_Brony> Samari hat
<Tovler> http://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Unicorn-Castle-Purple-T-shirt/dp/B0037TPED4/ref=cm_cr_pr_sims_t :( That's a nice shirt actually.
<YourLittleDashie> New TF2 Hat
<SuperBrony64> 10,02So this is just about Apple? They are going to keep the name and the voice on the show?
<yay> blank flank
<Dynamic_Brony> DAT SHIRT
<yay> no
<unfoundbug> SuperBrony64 its still on the dvds as far as been reported
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: it might not necessarily BE Hasbro that did it. Depending on how much leeway apple has on this stuff, they could have changed it. Notice, the redone RD line doesn't actually sound like Ashleigh Ball
<Waffles> hello yay
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: i assume someone complained and then hasbro's pr department threw a hissy fit
<SilverStreak> baby buster
<YourLittleDashie> nope.ave Tovler
<SilverStreak> lol
<unfoundbug> and all other sources still keep derpy as is
<Sumica> 00,10It's too soon to say SB.
<unfoundbug> including hub site
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: nobody really knows. This story just dropped a couple of hourse ago.
<Phase4> we wont know until it airs agani
<Dynamic_Brony> WOW
<September> Wow I've been asleep, I missed The Return of Harmony didn't i.
<Phase4> again'
<Bluestrom_S> I don't know SuperBrony64 but if I was you I would get a hold of the old episode
<Sumica> 00,10but so far only Itunes version is changed.
<Phase4> September: missed a bit more than that
<Tovler> you can give that shirt to your anti-brony friends to they can troll you with it.
<bartsonic> well i have to do an essay in my writing class and i can do it on anything so im going to do it on my little pony friendship is magic
<September> Phase4 Like what?
<Dynamic_Brony> propellor
<Darf14> I think it might be Apples Doing
<Sumica> 00,10as of tight now Hubworld version is unchanged as is Indemand version.
<Phase4> September: derpy's voice was changed on the itunes copy
<Yahooz> Im back and wat is this apple stuff?
<AttackWithHugs> bartsonic: Do it. hard.
<Phase4> rainbow's too
<September> Phase4 Changed how?
<Phase4> of the last roundup
<Darf14> and that is another reason I dont like Apple very much
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm going to be sad if it's changed for good :(
<Dynamic_Brony> Here he comes, here comes Speed Racer
<Phase4> September: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/02/derpy-has-been-modified.html
*Tovler tricks iTunes into editting Rainbow's mane.
<bartsonic> ive also worked on a power point for it hopes i can use it
<GabeMoist> Apple's rulers changed the episode on their own, that's why RD sounds weird
<Sumica> 00,10but we already have the unchanged version SB.
<SteveCharb> Go! speed racer Go! speed racer GOOOO
<Sumica> 00,10they cant change that.
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: well if it is, FUCK THEM. We've got the original, real Derpy, so they can suck it.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But I mean in future episodes
<GrimGallop> I'm fine with the new voice. Derpy sounded a bit too derpy, imo. Getting rid of her name, though... that's just madness D:<
<unfoundbug> SuperBrony64 theres gonna be enough brony movement behind it where the original is basically better protected than any other episodes
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Are they going with that feminine voice and the lack of her name?
<Phase4> i dont like the new voice, its a bad va
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: we will hire Tabitha St. Germaine to redub the lines.
<Sumica> 00,10Time will tell
<Dynamic_Brony> No MGS mode
<Sumica> 00,10But I saw last round up as a one time thing to begin with.
<RAWRity> That can be the next project for Bronydubs.
<pony> The new voice is terrible.
<Tovler> oh dude, we could totally trick fringe christians into attacking Rainbow Dash.
<Dynamic_Brony> Chaff Grenade
<Golakka> Illegal
<Golakka> :)
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Her voice was flawless the first time, the new VA doesn't make her sound clumbsy at all.
<SteveCharb> Palin vs Ponies
<RAWRity> The new VOICE isn't bad, but it's clear that it was done very quickly, and likely not with a lot of direction, so the acting is shit.
<Tovler> Actually, I shouldn't say that. There might be lurking trolls here.
<SteveCharb> it will happen
<SilverStreak> i'm still offened that they did that thing with derpy. anyone else disabled and offened that they REMOVED the original scene?
<Golakka> oh god, I need to buy a car, put chaff and flare dispensers on it
<Sumica> 00,10What Tovler? You want them to retcon dash in all eps to Darring do?
<Dynamic_Brony> dat speed
<Tovler> Fox News did attack the Lorax afterall
<GabeMoist> My Little Daring Do
<bartsonic> why has derpy been modified there was nothing wrong with her
<otakon> bartsonic: bc people were offended by her
<SteveCharb> but then what would the reading rainbow episode be?
<RAWRity> Sumica: at this point? The more petulant side of me wants to see how far we could push that kinda thing before hasbro completely loses their shit.
<SilverStreak> fox attacks anything new
<bartsonic> -___- i dont want to live on this planet anymore
<yay> okay, rename applejacks
<AttackWithHugs> Tovler: Why'd they attack the Lorax? They attack EVERYTHING
<GabeMoist> I'm offended that people are offended
<otakon> SilverStreak: they attacked the Muppets movie and The Lorax/ Arriety recently
<Dynamic_Brony> dem stealth
<RAWRity> also, something I saw the other day, THE LORAX is being used as a tie-in to sell SUVs.
<Mutterguy> the Lorax is hardly new though
<YourLittleDashie> Bye guyss
<Golakka> Oh man! Aircraft pornography on bronystate? we cannot do this :p
<yay> the Thneeds
<Dashie_Dashie> my theroy is, if derp offends you.. then go on 4chan and memebase and take all derp related images off the internet.
<Dashie_Dashie> can't be done.
<Sumica> 00,10I like the show i dont want to see it get caned because pepole freaking out.
<YourLittleDashie> Goodnight
<RAWRity> Dr. Suess' most environmentally minded book...is being used to sell cars that get 18 miles to the gallon.
<bartsonic> well bye guys im off to go find a new planet to live on bye
<Bluestrom_S> good night YourLittleDashie
<AttackWithHugs> Night, YourLittleDashie
<Bluestrom_S> IM FREAKING OUT
<Dynamic_Brony> DEM GOLD
<Zappy> Night YourLittleDashie
<SilverStreak> @otakon why do such an evil thing? i love muppets. and i want to see the lorax and arriety
<Sumica> 00,10Say hi to your peole bartsonic ^_^
<Lunarletic> prism
<otakon> SilverStreak: bc Fox is insane and filled with idiots
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I'm sending a letter to Hasbro that I'm offended by their use of ponies in the show My Little Pony, it's offensive and the show needs to be redone with Pikachus.
<RAWRity> btw, the EQD post is up to over 1000 comments already.
<yay> why not zoidberg
<otakon> SuperBrony64: have fun man and hi!
<GabeMoist> lolSB64
*otakon hugs SuperBrony64
<GrimGallop> O.o
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai otakon :3
*SuperBrony64 hugs otakon
<Phase4> hi otakon
<Darf14> If it gets over 9000 post then I will make a obvious joke
<Tovler> yay, but MLP along with the brony comminity would be an easier target than The Lorax or The Muppets
<otakon> hiya Phase4
*GabeMoist calls otakon on codec
<SilverStreak> i love the voice of the lorax. his voice is perfect
<Hodiku> SB64, you lie, you could never say anything bad about ponies!
<GrimGallop> I don't think you could get away with that. Pikachu's already copyrighted.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02I know ;____;
<RAWRity> SuperBrony64: I'moffended by them calling ponies "little". That's offensive to people and ponies who are short. Clearly the Dwarfism community is being ridiculed by their terminology.
<SuperBrony64> 10,02But I want Derpy back ;____;
<GrimGallop> Try platypi.
<Dynamic_Brony> GRAY FOX!!!
<GabeMoist> I'm offended by their use of "My"
<Tovler> I'm sorry SuperBrony64. Derpy now partially belongs to haters now.
<Golakka> F117 car :p
<GabeMoist> It's "Our"
<DeadlyDerp3> Look, MYTHBUSTERS :D
<DeadlyDerp3> I saw them live a month earlier :D
<Dynamic_Brony> As long as I still have the original. Deroy will live on
<Dashie_Dashie> I just hope these dumbass kids don't blow this too out of purportion and end up getting the show canned..
<Phase4> SuperBrony64: we can only hope ;_;
<GabeMoist> Deroy
<Dashie_Dashie> then who's to blame.
<stallion1> flywood
<yay> I'm offended by the grey pony destroying buildings. It looks like it was on purpose, and i must say TOO soon to apple.
<Dynamic_Brony> Derpy
<unfoundbug> oh hello alarm, im already awake
<GabeMoist> DEROOOOYY JEEEENNKINNS

<GrimGallop> Trying to watch Mythbusters, chat, and Minecraft at the same time isn't ending well for me. I'll be on Steam if anyone needs me :P
*GrimGallop vanishes.
<RAWRity> I'm offended that Pegasi are in MLP. Normal horses cannot fly, and this portrayal of ponies as being able to fly is hurtful to the pride and self-esteem of horses everywhere.
*GabeMoist banishes Grim
<SonicRainboom> Shut up.
<Bluestrom_S> I'm sad :(
<SonicRainboom> Pegasi ponies are best ponies./
<Zappy> Wow, it's late. Well, going to bed. Bye everypony.
<Darf14> well im going to bed for real this time, instead of leaving sad because of the Derpy incident, so goodnight guys for real this time :)
*Mutterguy wonders where Midnight_tempest went
<GabeMoist> I'm offended by the plainess of Earth Ponies
<Waffles> bye Darf14
<yay> I'm offended at Fancy Pants and the royal family. The bourgeois have no place in a harmonious society.
<Bluestrom_S> derpy was never ment to be offensive she's a pony not a human
<SonicRainboom> I
<Lunarletic> I'
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity, since when could Sarah Jessica Parker fly?
<SonicRainboom> ^
<Lunarletic> I'm offended at reality
<GabeMoist> Unicorns have magic, Pegasi have flying, Earth Ponies have nothing
<Golakka> oshi! Chaff cannon
<Tovler> SJP could fly in Hocus Pocus
<SilverStreak> i'm offened by unicorns! there is no such thing as magic and it is not christian to use any power that belongs to jesus when they aren't jesus >:(
<Mutterguy> they have cookies!!!
<Mutterguy> that's all that matters
<Tovler> and SJP flew to Dubai in Sex and the City 2.
<GabeMoist> Jesus likes ponies, so it's ok
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> i'm offended that this show have colors in it, it totally promotes imagination and free thinking in my time tv was black and white!
<Tovler> I'm an expert
<Lunarletic> I'm offended at reality! WHERES MY CHOCOLATE RAIN!?
<RAWRity> I'm aslo offended by unicorns. The extinction of the unicorn race was a terrible event that occured a scant 3000 years ago. The fact that they would make jokes with unicorns so soon after the horrible destruction of their people is nothing short of disgusting. We should boycott hasbro!
<unfoundbug> ahh the pre- shockwatch sticker era
<yay> I'm scared by zombies, even if they take 3 days to respawn
<Ingwaz> i'm going to sleep, night everypony
<Tovler> o yeah. Unicorns are godless creatures that drowned in the flood.

<yay> pegasi ponies control the weather

<SonicRainboom> But there is no god in Equestria.
<Phase4> i'ma leave this channel, later

<AttackWithHugs> The unicorn mask DEFINITELY screams 'stalker'
<Sundaysmile> yeah, but the dvd version is gonna be changed yeah or no?
<DeadlyDerp3> We have gotten use to calling her derpy

<TopHat> twss
<Photon_Phoenix> Wow, @RAWRity did you read the 3rd review down on that barrel you linked to?

<DeadlyDerp3> For the love of GOD
<Dynamic_Brony> Poetic Justice!!!
<GabeMoist> Hasbro made more poniesa
<Tovler> Hasbro should have sent use preparation H before unleashing this.

<Buytoast> "Captain, we're approaching level 9 butt hurt from the Brony Scetor!"
<Lunarletic> for the love of Luna it isn't HASBRO!
<DJ-DR34M3R> it's apple doing it, not hasbro
<Ingwaz> only apple? unless you're saying apple was the one who modified the ep

*Tovler wonders if Screwball is responsible for this.

<Tovler> Wasn't it a barrel of lube that gave Alex Mack her superpowers?
<SilverStreak> hey hey hey stay out of my shed
<AttackWithHugs> RAWRity is having a little TOO much fun with the lube......
<MirrorImage> Dashie_Dashie - show's not going to die, but you can almost bet that if this doesn't get re-retconned, we're not going to get anything nearly so controversial in the future
<Dynamic_Brony> F*** the lupe ( F the police voice)

My wife, too. And not just what you'd think. One day I just hosed down our hardwood-floored hallway so I could use it as a slip-n-slide. You shouldn't think of this as a 'purchase.' It's an 'investment.' An investment sure to pay off in spades."

<Cherry> she told me to give this to you

<DaringDude> i love Lyra
<Dark_Horst> the ps vita is a scam

<Veewave> This would be a better ghost story with Nappa's ghost.
<otakon> SuperBrony64: why didn't you wait man, it's too expensive atm
<yay> dat cat
<magicman> bad kitty.
<SonicRainboom> Kitty is obvious plot device.
<unfoundbug> not too happy with the devkit they released

<AttackWithHugs> Veewave: Ghost Nappa

<Dynamic_Brony> Get out
<Photon_Phoenix> It's all talk, hardly any action

<Photon_Phoenix> you got the 3G version of Vita?
<SuperBrony64> 10,02It's not for everypony sure, but I liked it enough to warrant a purchase
<otakon> SuperBrony64: super expensive low capacity memory cards, no UMD support, have to PAY to redownload UMD games you already own, NO 1st party support and a HORRIBLE release line up. SuperBrony64 I know you like it but it was a bad idea to buy it right off the bat is all I'm saying

<Waffles> star
<CupcakeWarrior> warning: wall of text about the final fight in TTGL
<CupcakeWarrior> Theoretically if the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is 10 million light years across, it would mean that its eventual battle with the equally large Granzeboma would last several billion years, considering that nothing can exceed the speed of light. This would mean that swinging an arm alone might be a feat that would traverse several million light years, which will require the same number of years in real time, to execute. However, sin
<RainbowJack> lolz
<Dashie_Dashie> AND THATS HOW THE UNIVERSE WAS MADE
<CupcakeWarrior> SCIENCE

<Scavender> Hi everypony.
<CountDoofus> think Hasbro anticipated the whole Derpy fiasco, and now make us suffer for it?
<Dashie_Dashie> well, it still is kinda their fault in a way.. unless it was just Apple that screwed with it.
<Dashie_Dashie> we're good.
<CupcakeWarrior> I knew Hasbro would do something about Derpy as soon as I heard her in the show
<Dashie_Dashie> but if it was hasbro, they know we'd be upset with atleast telling us.
<CupcakeWarrior> Or anyone in general
<Dashie_Dashie> Well, it's just been a few hours since this went down.
<Dashie_Dashie> give it time to shed light on the situation
<pony_8017> aka shitstorm incoming

<TopNotchBrony> DAMN
<Jake> Everypony is best pony!
<Kammerjunk> Golakka: Because Twilight is best pony.
<meh> owned
<CupcakeWarrior> Rainbow Dash is best pony
<TopNotchBrony> HE GOT TAKEN OUT
<Reaper> Silencer shots XD
<Kammerjunk> Of the Mane 6, anyway.
<TopNotchBrony> but seriously
<TopNotchBrony> fluttershy
<Snuffsis> Pinkie Pie is best pony though, She always makes me smile.
<TopNotchBrony> pinkie pie
<Golakka> Rarity is best pony, All other ponies are a very close second :P
<TopNotchBrony> rainbow dash
<TopNotchBrony> applejack
<prince-dari> Dash is best pony
<TopNotchBrony> twilight
<TyeDyeBrony> is the episode today at 10?

<Reaper> ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY CHOSE BEST PONY :[
<CupcakeWarrior> No one likes Applejack

<prince-dari> There's no ep today
<TyeDyeBrony> someon tell me so I can decide how much longer to sleep
<CountDoofus> there's no episode today, TyeDyeBrony
<MASF123> I think Derpy actually got 65% votes out of most of the fanbase 6_9
<TyeDyeBrony> D:
<Kammerjunk> Fluttershy is adorable and all, but of the Mane 6, Twilight is obviously superior.
<Lunarletic> Spike is best Rainbow Dash
<meh> i cant see anypony but pinkie pie as best pony
<TyeDyeBrony> yay sleep
<Snuffsis> If fluttershy is crying, i want to kill the one responsible.
<TopNotchBrony> rarity = worst pony
<TopNotchBrony> soz
<RawketLawnchair> Pew pew pew.
<CupcakeWarrior> Rarity is third best pony
<Reaper> Noob snipers :[
<Kammerjunk> Nope. No actual wolf.
<Kammerjunk> It's a werewolf.
<Jake> my dice decided i should pick flutteshy
<meh> theyre all great ponies but pinkie will always be there to help them smile :)
<dshannon> its an alien
<Snuffsis> Nah, it's just a hungry pony howling
<Twi_Fi> Werewolf is best wolf.
<TopNotchBrony> shes not bad just the worst out of them
<TopNotchBrony> no
<Reaper> IT"S A FLUTTERSHY BECAUSE IT:S HER SHED

<Krowa> OMFG..
<Reaper> Werewolf < Knife. Royal guard
<Jake> what is this anyway?
<KwakLad> Hey Scavender how you doing?
<Golakka> Any man who is not willing to die for a cause, is not worth being called a man
<meh> that man is dead very very dead
<Scavender> Yea, doing fine, thanks for asking.
<Kammerjunk> Golakka: How many roads must a man walk down?
<Jake> i meant the movie
<TopNotchBrony> be vewy vewy quiet
<CupcakeWarrior> When is Pinkie gonna break out of the fourth wall?
<Jake> 42!
<KwakLad> Kammerjunk: 42
<Reaper> ROOF!
<Kammerjunk> KwakLad: Oh ho ho, you magnificent bastard.
*Iota is back
<Kammerjunk> Also you, Jake. But you didn't ping me, so I didn't notice.
<Snuffsis> isn't it a thousand miles?
<Golakka> AND I WOULD WALK FIVE HUNDRED MILES
<Golakka> AND I WOULD WALK FIVE HUNDRED MORE!
<TopNotchBrony> AND I WOULD WALK FIVE HUNDRED MORE
<KwakLad> Kammerjunk: i had an argument with my physics teacher last week about what 42 meant, she thought it was the meaning of life
<Jake> i'm not so good with irc
<Golakka> JUST TO BE THE MAN TO WALK A THOUSAND MILES TO FALL DOWN AT YOUR DOOR!
<CupcakeWarrior> oh dear
<Golakka> NNAAA NA NA OH!
<Kammerjunk> KwakLad: But it's the answer, not the meaning!
<TopNotchBrony> DU DOO DOO
<Snuffsis> 42 is the amount of letters in that sentence, if you didn't know.
<Golakka> NAAA NA NA HO
*CupcakeWarrior sings in bad Scottish accent
<Jake> 42 is the answer, what is the questio?
<Golakka> DO DA DA RUM RUM DA RUM DA RUM
<RawketLawnchair> Lycanthropy.
<KwakLad> Kammerjunk: i had to explain that it was just an arbitrary number to a nonsensicle question and that Deep Thought explaind they didnt give a proper question and so he designed the earth to make the true questioin
<KwakLad> it was a shouting match in physics
<Golakka> Christmas time, Mistletoe and wine, CHildren singing christian rhymes
<Jake> but it failed becaus it was destroyed
<Kammerjunk> KwakLad: Douglas Adams even said himself that it was a load of horseapples.
<RawketLawnchair> Throw the books at 'em
<meh> because knowledge is power
<Dashie_Dashie> Woooo
<Snuffsis> Kwaklad, deepthought picked 42 from the amount of letters in the "answer" though, if i remember right? :P
<Iago> wb
<Dashie_Dashie> Pinkie pies message of the week ;3
<Kammerjunk> And because knowing is half the battle
<Kammerjunk> !
<RawketLawnchair> Meteoric Iron?
<CupcakeWarrior> dat comic
<Golakka> Just have one thing to say
<Golakka> if the pen is mightier than the sword why are actions stronger than words
<Golakka> sorry if the pen is mightier than the sword, why are actions stronger than words
<Kammerjunk> Snuffsis: So now we just have to find EVER POSSIBLE COMBINATION.
<Snuffsis> Because human society is still very primitive. :P
<Golakka> makes it readable :P
<CupcakeWarrior> silly Dash, dont you know paint is bad for your body?
<RawketLawnchair> Steampunk.
<Waffles> What are we wacthing?
<Dashie_Dashie> primitive? WE HAVE PONIES FOR CHRIST SAKES.

<Kammerjunk> And now the Doctor went oatmeal.
<croccobotto> wonder why they delayed the episode >_>
<Snuffsis> Kammerjunk: I know, but that she picked 42 as the "answer" was because that was the amount of letters in the question. or so i heard. :P

<Sundaysmile> yes
<PinkiePieCopy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0Ik_WOzqnA&feature=player_detailpage DISCORD YOUVE CROSSED DA LINE
<Pale_Horse> it is actually looking like it is more of an action of Apple, rather than Hasbro, that edited the Itunes episode.
<pikorar> Ugh.
<Coolbluemidnite> I dont take any offence though and im almost blind in my right eye
<Coolbluemidnite> =/
<pikorar> That's it. I thought Ponies restored my faith in humanity. Now I JUST LOST IT AGAIN!
*Tovler summons a Pegasus Hurricane
<Pale_Horse> hasbro's actions up to this point seemed to indicate that they were fine with leaving Derpy as-is. but it seems that Apple exec worried about the controversy and had the Itunes installment edited.
<Sundaysmile> Nevertheless it is still unsure whether the dvd will contain the original or the edited
<Coolbluemidnite> Its original i think i read somewhere
<PinkiePieCopy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umab4jYKrOk&feature=player_detailpage BRING BACK THE WEEPING MEMORIES
<Trollestia> Wrek, can you put up the edited derpy scene?
<Pale_Horse> We need top wait for official statements from both companies, but it's seeming much more like the fault of Apple than Hasbro art this point.

*PinkiePieCopy shoots Hasbro
<Doomsdaylee> The new voice is acctually female, so yay.
<Dark_Horst> yeah, the eyes kinda make me sad
<Sundaysmile> yeah, it's been stricken from the ep
<Doomsdaylee> but...the eyes? The voice?
<Kirakishou> 03o.o
<Sundaysmile> or at least on itunes
<Link02> Blame Apple/iTunes. They were responsible for the edit.
<kenne88> oh ok
<DainbowRash> Ashleigh's voice sounds diff. too.
<Doomsdaylee> Oh thank Inari.
<Sundaysmile> not sure about the dvd
<DainbowRash> :/
<The_4th_Wall> New Derpy voice is Tabitha St Germain
<Dark_Horst> i still thinkt here was absolutely no need to cut the name but eh... happened
*bronyguru5 gives Link02 a brohoof
<Doomsdaylee> I was about to lose faith in Faust and the team.
<Fantasy_Mane> i have the old version
<jffry890> you could just do a black n white pencil sketch and post it onto deviant art and it would be jsut as good as anything with color
<PinkiePieCopy> The original voice actor didn't know Derpy was a girl when she played it..
<GentleHeaven> sai tool eh? not bad choice of software
<Orzaidius> *^*
<Doomsdaylee> Right.
<Sundaysmile> you could sign this, might make you feel better http://www.change.org/petitions/hasbro-studiosthe-hub-do-not-change-derpys-name
<sonicxsx> Hi!
<Dark_Horst> i already like that gaze
<Coolbluemidnite> Big adventures tones of fun a beautiful heart faithful and strong <3
<Sundaysmile> but will likely accomplish nothing
<Link02> If Hasbro caved in, they could've lost their deal with Apple/iTunes. Doesn't how small it may seem.
<sonicxsx> ...
<AppleEric> hey guys
*P0N-3 scratches her puggle's tummy.
<The_4th_Wall> Faust is now only the Consulting exec
<Link02> I mean 'If Hasbro didn't* cave in'
<Gold> im bored
<AppleEric> can i get a question i have been asking for 2 days answered please?
<Dark_Horst> the title of that petition is extremely flawed
<Doomsdaylee> I like this song.
<PinkiePieCopy> Why the hell would I sign it and give away where I live?
<PinkiePieCopy> XD
<Tovler> I'm reading a lot of rumors here.
<The_4th_Wall> OMG THIS SONG
<Sundaysmile> invent a place
<Dark_Horst> "do not change derpy" would be more accurate, actually
<Coolbluemidnite> Squee
<Fantasy_Mane> love this song
<Sundaysmile> just say equestria
<Link02> Hasbro needs to find an alternative to iTunes.
<The_4th_Wall> SO MUCH SOUNDBOARD USE
<jffry890> squee
<Doomsdaylee> Let them lose the Itune's deal.
<KwakLad> Hi sonicxsx
<Fantasy_Mane> need title of song
<Gold> bye all! i go "bronydanceparty" livestream! http://www.livestream.com/bronydanceparty?utm_source=lsplayer&utm_medium=ui-chat&utm_campaign=bronydanceparty&utm_content=bronydanceparty join if you want
<Doomsdaylee> Itunes sucks anyways, and rips them out of most of the money
<Doomsdaylee> WTB song XD
<KwakLad> had chat bugged on me?
<Sundaysmile> nevertheless 29000 signatures is..... pretty impressive
<AppleEric> how do i enter the lottery drawing for picking episodes?
<Link02> What brush set does he use?
<mario_pony> it's just not the same without her old voice!
<PinkiePieCopy> Doomsdaylee: It does not! Only because of the Deadmau5.
<jffry890> 5$ says he just caught a ton of crap by linking that stream...
<Dark_Horst> i hope they'll air the ep soon on the hub again. i'm burning to see if that'll be the changed or the original version. since the hub is kinda the canon
<P0N-3> Awwww I just read that puggles and beagles both suffer from epilepsy, my little puggle could get epilepsy, yes he could, he could get pugglepsy.
<Sundaysmile> he just uses crayons and draws on the monitor
*The_4th_Wall goes to that stream, bitches him out
<Tovler> so they'd put their faith Blast Hardchee- I mean, a Blu-ray release.
<SayWhat> Is Wrek streaming?
<KwakLad> Link02: not sure he has ever said, though im not around all the time soi dont know
<Yahooz> yes he is
<AppleEric> how do i enter the lottery for choosing episodes!
<Sundaysmile> they haven't shown it on a repeat since it aired
<KwakLad> SayWhat: yes he is
<Dark_Horst> ponies? in amnesia?

<Coolbluemidnite> sweet apple massacre made me laugh... but i have a twisted scense of humor
<Trollestia> I've only read Cupcakes; I don't feel like reading those other two.
<DainbowRash> ^
<Doomsdaylee> Is that chell pony?
<Doomsdaylee> I'll always recommend the Discorded/Reharmonized series.
<Fantasy_Mane> SAM really did nothing to me, cuz ik that Mac would not do that stuff that he did in that fanfic
<Link02> OK I'm back.
*The_4th_Wall hopes Cupcakes' author is so haunted by what he wrote he never writes again
<Doomsdaylee> Nor would Dashie in Rainbow factory, but it still struck a blow.
<DainbowRash> Would Pinkie?
<Link02> Does anyone yet know what brushes he's using?
<Kez_Pony> And I'm about to read Sweet apple massacre

<applejack096> whats glomps suoerbrony64??
<Dark_Horst> i have no idea what that thing is you have
<The_4th_Wall> Chrome: she snapped because OCD rules and governs her life
<Meanwhile> It eats up free time and doesn't afraid of anything.
<Dark_Horst> what's it do?
<SaturnPie> 08,01what happened was, i stopped wearing the glasses because they were hurting my nose and causing a rash
<Chrome> Otakon So is my wife XD And she's a Brony
*SayWhat says what
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Glomps = Tackle hug
<SaturnPie> 08,01so i wore contact lenses
<SaturnPie> 08,01for 2 days only
<KwakLad> Ohh
<Tovler> It's still more that 1 week until new ponies?
<KwakLad> i can see where this is going :p
<SaturnPie> 08,01and in that time, the conctact lenses caused a hyper-immune response on my right eyelid
<Meanwhile> Tovler: Technically it's 1 week.
<Chrome> The_4th_Wall: True, but it caused tons of Discord...and after his little "interest" in her...whos to say she couldn't be a back up? XD Pinks does have the power, but XD
<Dark_Horst> how did that fuck up your eyes?
<The_4th_Wall> Chrome: Pinkie spreads chaos all the time, and of her own volition
<SonicRainboom> ....
<Dark_Horst> oh
<Dark_Horst> that DOES sound painfull
<otakon> SaturnPie: damn it man, tell me it's not too late for you man!
<Chrome> The_4th_Wall True enough. I concede your point.
<KwakLad> Hey SaturnPie atleast you are not turning albino from it
<CCCP> Whut did i miss?
<SaturnPie> 08,01so you know how if you're allergic to a dog and one licks your arm, it will bubble up and go red?
<Tovler> (ugh, that damn hamburger pizza… I have to have it)
<SaturnPie> 08,01that's basically what i've got on the inside of my eyelid
<otakon> SaturnPie: yuck
<SayWhat> Oh sheeit
<Jim> ouch
<Dark_Horst> fucking ouch
<Meanwhile> SaturnPie: oh jeezus.
<The_4th_Wall> Pinkie is best pony. MY LOGIC IS UNDENIABLE.
<SayWhat> When you blinked with the contact lens...
<otakon> SaturnPie: dude, do they have you on anti-biotics or something?
<applejack096> wat did i miss?
<Wrek> 05dat exåression
<Tovler> huh, actually, I didn't know that about the dog.
<otakon> applejack096: not much
<Wrek> 05sxpression
<SayWhat> It scratched up your eyelid
<Wrek> 05i think i nailed it
<otakon> damn you lag STOP IT!
<Dark_Horst> SaturnPies's eyes are going all fallout on him
<CCCP> :|
<KwakLad> SaturnPie: okay i can see your pain now, least its not perminant
<Meanwhile> I think so to Wrek.
<SaturnPie> 08,01so i'm currently ocularly useless, because i can wear neither glasses nor contact lenses
<SonicRainboom> 4th wall, I deny your logic.
<applejack096> kk otakon wat song is this?
<The_4th_Wall> Dat Moostasche
<otakon> no idea applejack096 ask Wrek
<SayWhat> Use monocles on both eyes
<SaturnPie> 08,01SayWhat: now that... that is an amazing idea
<Tovler> SaturnPie: you mean legally blind?
<applejack096> Wrek wots this song?
<otakon> SaturnPie: why can't you wear glasses?
<SonicRainboom> For we are talking about the magical land of ponies, also knoiwn as Equestria. Tell me how logic applies here.
<SaturnPie> 08,01Tovler: i guess i am, yes
<The_4th_Wall> Sonic, I reject your denial and throw a party
<Dark_Horst> but where does one get monocles?
<SaturnPie> 08,01but it's only for a few days until my eye and nose heal
<CCCP> is Wrek drawing?
<Chrome> CCCP Yep
<SayWhat> si
<Meanwhile> Yes. Yes he is.
<Chrome> SayWhat See what? XD
<SaturnPie> 08,01otakon: they're causing a rash on my nose
*SaturnPie 08,01is allergic to eyesight
<SayWhat> Chrome: Who?
<otakon> SaturnPie: dude, good to hear they caught it in time
<SayWhat> Chrome: Where?
<applejack096> Wreck dude ur gooood!
<otakon> SaturnPie: then you need to use better frames and keep your nose clean
<Chrome> SayWhat I was joking "Si? See What?"
<The_4th_Wall> BUZZ LOOK A PONY!
<SayWhat> Chrome: I know :P
<SonicRainboom> But I'm a Rainboom. I crash your party by blowing up the whole building your in.
<SaturnPie> 08,01that's £17 for contact lenses down the drain, tough...
<Chrome> IT'S PYRO PINKIE
<SonicRainboom> Taste the rainbow.
<SaturnPie> 08,01*tough
<SaturnPie> 08,01*though
*Chrome dives for cover.
<SaturnPie> 08,01literally; i had to flush the lenses this morning
<SaturnPie> 08,01w/in 30
<derp> i just relized i acidently had this muted the whole time6_9
<Tovler> would wearing prescription steampunk googles be a substitute for eyeglasses?
<Chrome> USE GUMMI FOR A SHEILD, SHE WON'T BURNINANTE HIM
<The_4th_Wall> ^
<CCCP> derp: me too
<applejack096> mum wants me to stob being a pegasister wat to dooooo!
<SayWhat> Watch more
<Dark_Horst> ignore
<CCCP> applejack096: say NO!
<SayWhat> Tell her to fuck off
<CCCP> ^
<Meanwhile> Punch that...oh wait you're 12. I can't say that.
<The_4th_Wall> Very loOOOOUUUUUUUDD!!!!!!!
<SonicRainboom> Kill your mother in the name of friendship.
<Chrome> Hold on Ponies.
<Meanwhile> SayWhat: that is some really awful advice.
<The_4th_Wall> Too late
<CountDoofus> tell her that watching a show you like is your choice, and she has no word in that
<Chrome> applejack096 Why is it she wants you to stay way from ponies?
<applejack096> LOL GUYS!!!!
<The_4th_Wall> She had a heart attack last year
<SayWhat> Meanwhile: 'Tis the best :o
<Meanwhile> Seriously, applejack096 is like, 12.
<Tovler> Only watching more ponies can stop you from being a pegasister. that makes sense, right?
<applejack096> Cause im 12 she feels im too old!
<PinkiePieCopy> Pinkmena?
<Meanwhile> I'm 19.
<SayWhat> Nopony's too old!
<Chrome> applejack096 21, and as an added bonus, in the Air Force XD

<SayWhat> I'm -3
<The_4th_Wall> I'm 22
<Dark_Horst> stare at here while she sleeps. when she notices, tell her the ponies are silent. you don't know who is bad if they are silent
<Tovler> 26. I was in highschool when you were born?
<Chrome> Show her the show..maybe Lesson Zero or one of the mature themed ones
<Meanwhile> What seems to be the officer problem?
<Link02> There should probably some red damage number somewhere to the left of the image :L
<Dark_Horst> drive your point home via fiddling with a sharp object
<Yahooz> I think the youngest we ever had is 10 if im not mistaken
<SonicRainboom> Yeah.
<Chrome> @Wrex I work on bombs, do school, make games, and watch ponies XD
