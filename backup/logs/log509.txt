<Bronysith> okay im done with the rp
<Alister> Shizuka: How was your day ?
<Bronysith> sick of it
<BowDownToTheSocks> theres a pony for that
<RAWRity> The only pony who can use a computer is my OC, Coffee Flower. His cutie mark is a Q key, and his special talent is being able to type with hooves.
<FlareChaser> Bronysith: prepare your mares to kneel.
<Lyra> It worked! thanks bronysith
<Alister> that's stupid
<Shizuka> 13botting on dustbowl

<RAWRity> He runs Equestria's only IT department.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh god, what now, Reggie? E3 was just the tip of an iceberg? Cool story, bro.
<Bee3ry> the implications of that would be troubling, RAWRity. Who writes all the software that Coffee Flower uses?
*Bronysith glomps Petrified_Discord
<Alister> Shizuka: I'm bored
*Petrified_Discord is glomped by Bronysith :O
<Reikim> RAWRity: Wouldn't unicorns be able to do that?
<RAWRity> Bee3ry: he does.
<Bronysith> RAWRity: whats up
<Bee3ry> RAWRity: so he writes all the programs. And is the sole consumer.
<Alister> Gee, it feels great to be ignored :(
<JRP2234> Shizuka did i miss the lottery again?
<RAWRity> Reikim: You ever tried using magic on a computer? Shit gets all antsy and it bricks your hard drive.
<Lyra> be right back bonbons tellin me somthing

<Bronysith> RAWRity: yea?
<AttackWithHugs> I present to you...a picture of my "friend"....
<AttackWithHugs> If it pleases the masses
<Alister> BowDownToTheSocks: I don't need sympathy from a sock lover
<Reikim> RAWRity: Nah man, you're using the wrong magic. You need technomancy. It's difficult, but putting your tower in a closed fast-time dimension greatly increases speed. Great for gaming.
<Lyra> oh im back
<BowDownToTheSocks> Alister: Actually, I prefer flipflops
<AttackWithHugs> http://attackwithhugs.deviantart.com/art/A-special-friend-308642050
<Petrified_Discord> Put flame decals on your computer. It makes it faster.
<Alister> BowDownToTheSocks: OMG ! I wear those all the times
<Bee3ry> no no. painting it red makes it faster
<Bee3ry> and racing stripes
<Petrified_Discord> Or setting it on fire.

<Bee3ry> well, everything needs more glitter
<JRP2234> Did i miss the lottery
<JRP2234> and im not asking again

<DeathStar> Shimmer: but-but why :'(
<Lyra> Shimmer. You. ARE. EPICLY EPIC AWESOME SAUSE but not as cool as bronysith
<owlicious> North doesn't have internet, so they can't play
<Canadian_brony> BowDownToTheSocks I've tried, and I suck at that too. It doesn't help that my PE class either sucks more than me or plays hockey. Either your good at hockey or you suck at hockey
<Petrified_Discord> North Korea is full of nothing

*DeathStar hugs Ponies47
<Canadian_brony> what about Rainbow Dash?
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: what is the explanation?
<adasdad> ooh starcraft

<Polydunami> So is that DeathStar or DanceStar? :S
<owlicious> Kim Jong Un has increased the chocolate ration from 2 squares a month to 1 square a year.

<BowDownToTheSocks> Canadian_brony: I suppose, i for one, suck at hockey. Good thing my dad isnt a fan ^^
<DeathStar> Polydunami: what do you mean?
<Petrified_Discord> owlicious: Dat "increase" :D
<Muffin0> im digging a hole
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: ahhh, so since they're familiar with the concept and idea already, they immediately cling to it?
<SaxyPretender> 0,14and Koreans value games like that, and Starcraft is kinda reminiscent of that, iirc
<Canadian_brony> BowDownToTheSocks point taken
<owlicious> just kidding, i don't know. We don'
<hen3ry> that sounds like when Boris Yeltsin doubled the legal drinking age in Russia. From 2 to 4.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14something like that, Sylandest

<Lyra> Shimmer lunar=luna=stupid
<Shimmer> You did not just say that!
<Polydunami> Well, they do where I live :S
<BowDownToTheSocks> Canadian_brony: Im glad i'm American. No high expectations from anyone
<Canadian_brony> Lyra did you just insult Princess Luna?
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: It makes sense to me. One could prolly draw a lot of comparisons between traditional games of a society and compare them to the popular video games of the same theme or concept

<Lyra> maybe
<DeathStar> Polydunami: i guess.... if you scwint your ears

<Sylandest> and someone left

<Canadian_brony> hen3ry especially to Canadians
<Sylandest> bye whoever!
<|Discord|> I WUB U
<SaxyPretender> 0,14it's kinda why games with sexual content have a bigger risk of getting in trouble over things of a more violent nature

<Iron_Edge> not sure who taht was...
<Canadian_brony> who's leaving?
<Lyra> bronysith is best human
<hen3ry> Canadian_brony: Well, let's face it, we're just getting revenge for 1812.
<Shimmer> The US is ridiculous when it comes to stuff that shows skin
<Sylandest> SaxyPretender: eeyup. violence is in our nature easily and is easily accepted. Sexual content? oh lordy no, what have you done? :D

<Lyra> ok then prove it

<hen3ry> I won't go so far as to invoke the "no girls on the internet" rule - at least not while Shizuka-san is there - but...
<BowDownToTheSocks> Canadian_brony: I honestly have no idea, i just heard that become a stereotype overtime. Though, i have one question. How can Canadians be so nice, yet play the most vicious, un-nice sport in the world(Hockey)?

<Canadian_brony> CowDownToTheSocks it's Canadian HUMOUR (with a U), and it consists of jokes that only Canadians would fully understand
<BowDownToTheSocks> Slyandest: You should have said "fantastic"! Its the only Doctor Who-ish kinda fitting thing i could think of.
<SaturnCake> 08,01mainly from my knowledge of latin

<CrimsonPhoenix> Seriously, Werid all in aquabats?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Weird**
<BowDownToTheSocks> sonicrainboomer259: I like all of the songs. I still haven't even started Portal 2 because steam is being itself. I liked the theme of the first Portal
<CrimsonPhoenix> For some reason I want to hope that's a step closer to weird all in MLP
<Canadian_brony> Iron_Edge I was just about to say something to you, something about the Mane 6 . . .
<sonicrainboomer259> I love aquabats\
<Sylandest> CrimsonPhoenix: all will fall under our power...it cannot be stopped

<Polydunami> Thanks, kirx :3
<Polydunami> *kirz :S
<Tovler> inkie pie is in Aquabat? She's canon?
<Canadian_brony> hi Phase4. Are you sane?
<BowDownToTheSocks> sonicrainboomer259: Yes, it's quite sad. Sometimes when i'm drawing it that song will end and i just won't notice so i get bored not knowing why. Then i quit drawing. See, if that song were longer maybe i wouldnt get bored as easily
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_brony, i think i am
<Polydunami> Phase4, it's not your fault.
<CrimsonPhoenix> Phase4, I admit that's pretty cool
<Ponies47> Ohai Phase4 :)
<Canadian_brony> Phase4 can you tell me if I am? Between my exams, my tiredness, and whatever the hell Saturn was doing, I'm not sure if I am
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://www.tvguide.com/News/Weird-Al-Aquabats-1048890.aspx BUT THIS IS 1000 TIMES BETTER
<BowDownToTheSocks> Phase4: you may think you are sane
<Polydunami> Well, that was awkward :S
<Ponies47> *eye twitchs*
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_brony, what was saturn doing? must have missed it
<Polydunami> I felt like Kammerjunk there :$
<sonicrainboomer259> BowDownToTheSocks: I meant the whole game,beat in about five hours
<Iron_Edge> Canadian_brony: hahahaha....dont let me get a hold of your OC....or you and a few of the main 6 are gonna have some fun -lol
<Iron_Edge> Canadian_brony: thats what I said.
<Canadian_brony> Phase4 has Saturn ever showed you the pic of the stallion with the (Censored) cutie mark?
<LordCelestia> 0,5bai
<RX-78-SweetieBot> but wait, Weird Al is also gonna be in the Aquabats finale
<LordCelestia> 0,5bai
<LordCelestia> 0,5bai

<owlicious> Phase4: http://i.imgur.com/53hxW.png is sat's oc
<StupidSexyCJ> is the buffer show playing?
<RX-78-SweetieBot> Can one show contain both Weird Al and Pinkie Pie, as well as the Aquabats regular antics, without exploding into the real world?
<Sylandest> StupidSexyCJ: for the moment
<sonicrainboomer259> RX-78-SweetieBot: u serious?
<Phase4> 00,02RX-78-SweetieBot, we'll find out
<BowDownToTheSocks> sonicrainboomer259: i know right? (I thought you were talking about the song before, sorry) I loved Portal but it killed me when it ended... and for that matter when the cake was actually real
<Canadian_brony> Phase4 I was sent it twice. I think my eye is starting to twitch . . . HELP ME?
<Canadian_brony> Iron_Edge what OC? I can't draw
<Phase4> 00,02Canadian_brony, http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1842/
<Iron_Edge> Canadian_brony: Then you can just use a pony cretaor.
<Canadian_brony> Iron_Edge I will find one later
<JRP2234> ...
<Canadian_brony> Phase4 thanks
<Iron_Edge> Canadian_brony: kool, then maybe i'll see if I can convince fluttershy to make you wish you werent single :D -lol
*Canadian_brony drinks more Coa Cola
<Sylandest> Iron_Edge: you and your drawing shenanigans...:D
<Tovler> mmm. Coa Cola
<Canadian_brony> Iron_Edge I'm going to tell you this right now: she ain't my fav. pony
<sonicrainboomer259> BowDownToTheSocks: I have the X-box version,and it's an XBLA title,so it being short is understandable,and WHY DID RATMANN SAY THE CAKE IS A LIE?!
<Canadian_brony> Iron_Edge do you think you can guess who it is? She's part of the Mane 6
<Iron_Edge> Canadian_brony: Really now?? The riddle me this guy....who is? You can tell your brother Iron :)

*Sylandest watches Canadian_brony intently for answer
<Canadian_brony> Iron_Edge still no
<Iron_Edge> Canadian_brony: -lol RD?
<Sylandest> Canadian_brony: :D
<Canadian_brony> Iron_Edge eeyup
<Reikim> Guys. Very important thing. I just learned it. Three Deathcaps is overkill. That is all.
<Bronysith> GNIGHT EVERYPOONY and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL AND MAY YOU PIERCE THE HEAVENS WITH YOUR PASSION
<Iron_Edge> Canadian_brony: Of course -lol
<Sylandest> night, Bronysith!
<Canadian_brony> bye BronySith
<Ascendant> power PC + aircrack
<Ponies47> Goodnight Bronysith! NO SLEEP FOR ME! :p
<Ascendant> powerful*
<drf|laptop> 03...
*Bronysith puts a sleeping spell on Ponies47
<Canadian_brony> Iron_Edge but the REAL question is: do you know why?
<drf|laptop> 03it doesn't work like that
<drf|laptop> 03it's an open connection, but it redirects you to one of those "pay or gtfo" pagesc
<BowDownToTheSocks> sonicrainboomer259: I have the PC version. I never play PC games and for some reason i thought all PC games were all oddly long(I usually play games on XBOX) So when the game ended so sunddenly, im sitting there like "I should have savored it!!" Anyway, that cake didnt look too aperizing anyway, with pecans and all that
<Reikim> Night Brony- damn he's gone.
<Iron_Edge> she's rainbow dash you dont need a reason why -lol
<drf|laptop> 03apparently you can access Amazon for free so you can "shop while you fly" but that's it
<drf|laptop> 03so, not sure if I could exploit that xD
<Ponies47> Good thing I was where this *Show magic proof vest* :)
<drf|laptop> 03maybe cgiproxy hosted by Amazon web services?
<Ponies47> *Shows
<Ascendant> oh god those things
<drf|laptop> 03yeah
<Ascendant> I haven't really had the time or resources to try those
<Canadian_brony> Iron_Edge okay, yeah, but I go deeper than that
<drf|laptop> 03my school has one of those systems
<sonicrainboomer259> BowDownToTheSocks: what's your Gamertag?
<Ascendant> But I've never managed to exploit them
<Ascendant> you can try bruteforcing but
<Ascendant> that takes forever
<Iron_Edge> Canadian_brony: You've obviously had some kind of wet dream then. -lol or a clop episode :D
<BowDownToTheSocks> sonicrainboomer259: Wooky678
<Ascendant> But if you have the username, it's usually a 6-8 character pass
<Shizuka> 13i'd offer to let people come mow down bots with me but i know asuka starts crying above more than like 3 people when the rest are CPU
<Iron_Edge> Canadian_brony: but I wont delve into what you arent willing to tell -lol
<Ascendant> Anyway bbl
<BowDownToTheSocks> sonicrainboomer259: whats yours?
<richfiles> Post Stream over? or continuing shortly?
<Shamroc> Shizuka: i wanna join! ;p
<hen3ry> Shoulda never named my rocket after Celestia. Stupid thing is trollin me
<Polydunami> Iron_Edge, Rainbow Dash may be egotistical, but she still looks out for her friends.
<Canadian_brony> Iron_Edge she is how I first discovered the show, actually
<Iron_Edge> Polydunami: true :)
<RAWRity> Shizuka: I thought Asuka started crying when Angel aliens showed up to mindfuck her.
<Iron_Edge> Canadian_brony: -lol love at first sight then. Cute haha.
<ACS13123> ooooooooooo hhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiii :)
<drf|laptop> 03LOL bruteforcing
<drf|laptop> 03it goes by email afaik
<sonicrainboomer259> sadly enough,perfectchief22(it will be my account name on here when i get the ten bucks
<drf|laptop> 03last time I was on an airplane, they were offering free access for the holiday season
<drf|laptop> 03but this is the middle of June, I doubt they'd be doing anything like that
<JRP2234> im 2000km from my desktop
<Ascendant> Ah
<Ascendant> I've only ever used that system a few times
<Sylandest> howdy ACS13123
<richfiles> That's a long USB cable! :)
<Canadian_brony> Iron_Edge I watched the Starscream vs Rainbow Dash fight thinking that Starscream would win, but I was totally shocked by the fact that she won. It amazed me that a show MY 6-YEAR-OLD SISTER watches has a character that could obliterate Starscream. The rest is history
<Ascendant> So I don't really have enough experience or knowledge to attempt to exploit it
<kirzstryfe> 8,6Shizuka's computer is named asuka
<Ascendant> I don't even know what the software is
<Ponies47> HOORAY! IT'S COLD IN MY ROOM FOR ONCE! *Shivers*
<Ascendant> Sorry, can't help you here

<Iron_Edge> Canadian_brony: -lol

<Twilight_Ponies47> Hello hen3ry :)
<hen3ry> Hello Tw... er... huh?
<Derpy|Asleep> :V
<Twilight_Ponies47> hen3ry: It's me Ponies47. I kind of transformed into Twilight :)
<hen3ry> Huh. Only thing I ever transform into is a cherry, a bee, or a satire bot. I think I got gyped.
<Twilight_Ponies47> IDK?
<richfiles> I'd like to transform into a pony... :$
<hen3ry> Not me. Too many r34ers out there. Brr.
*BroKnee Talking to the door "How are you today KnockKnock?.....Thats good :)" eye twitches
<Twilight_Ponies47> *Screams in pain* *Changes back to normal*
<Ponies47> *Eyes derp* *Shakes self off* What happened?
*BroKnee Continues whispering to the door
<Ponies47> Ok then :)
<richfiles> Good night again! :)
<hen3ry> Well... I'm 11.4 million meters from home, I have 3/4 of a tank of fuel, it's daytime, and my kerbonauts forgot their sunglasses (and still can't find Luna up here)
*BroKnee Throws a cupcake at Ponies47
<Ponies47> *Licks cupcake off face* MMM. YUMMY!
<richfiles> Luna needs to be an easter egg in that space launch game! :$
<hen3ry> seriously!
*DeathStar dances
<BroKnee> http://weheartit.com/entry/9114905
<Phase4> 00,02is anyone streaming right now?
<BroKnee> Nope
<hen3ry> My third moon landing, alas, is likely doomed to end like my first - not enough fuel really to make it back to a safe spashdown. Going for 270 rather than 90 was a mistake.
<hen3ry> fate has ordained that the three brave kerbonauts who came in peace to explore the Mun, shall rest in peace there.
<richfiles> They will rest in peace... Cozyy and comfy with Princess Luna! :)
<hen3ry> Tis a far, far better place than here.
<Shizuka> 13and promptly crashes
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> Shizuka jinked
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> jinxed
<Shamroc> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: indeed
<Shizuka> 13gimme sec, loading it back up
<hen3ry> Oh, what jinx dost thou referest to?
<Shizuka> 13is there an A/D cp map with water?
<richfiles> So, landing on the moon, do you do it by slowing down with rockets in real life, or is the game different somehow? Do you use the normal ship, or do you use a LEM?
<hen3ry> The way I do it is this.
<Shamroc> Shizuka...uhh....idk..
<hen3ry> I have a three stage rocket (technically there's a fourth solid booster stage, but it's just a temporary one)
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> don't remember
<Shizuka> 13dust it is
<hen3ry> the top stage is my lander. It has one vectoring engine, and six fuel tanks (two tower, plus four attached to the side)
<hen3ry> I use the guidance wings as landing gear - the bottom tips of them are just a bit lower than the bottom of the engine
<Shizuka> 13i'm up
<hen3ry> As I approach the Mun in final approach, I try to keep my rocket's nose pointed straight up most of the time, except when I'm tilted to kill any lateral velocity - so when I'm on my final 10k meters to approach, I have ideally zero momentum in any direction except stright up and down relative to the munar surface
<cow334> Who is streaming
<Shamroc> holy holy hell phase
<ACS13123> Suddenly... STREAM!
<twilight_sprinkle> gah
<Panda-> Shizuka: I WANNA PLAY!
<twilight_sprinkle> suddenly mission
<richfiles> Suddenly, reason to stay! :)
<hen3ry> The last thousand meters or so to approach, I try to keep my speed below 20 m/s, and the last couple hundred meters, I throttle up a bit to slow to about 2 m/s, which is a safe landing speed - if I haven't ended up on the side of a munar mountain, anyway.
<Panda-> Sumica: that you streaming?
<Phase4> 00,02yay, audio keeps going
<Phase4> 00,02i'm streaming

<Iron_Edge> BroKnee: Yes sir....yes it is.
<Ninjazz|DaFeelz> Iron_Edge: I love the sweat running down his temple. :D
<cow334> hi every one what did i miss

<MadSurge> WallDives: I try using Peacock/Ms Fortune/Cerebella :D
<xxMoopyxx> ihave the game
<Iron_Edge> BroKnee: to be truthful my actual name is "Gary Markeith Griffin"
<BroKnee> Iron_Edge and now I respect you fully ^.^ I like the people that let others have their opinion <3
<cow334> xxMoopyxx: the new one sucks
<pony_9709> Duke Nukem Forever. I believe that's the game they meant to say
<WallDives> MadSurge, absolutely no synergy in that team...
<Ponies47> O hai Sumica. Do you thinks it's bad to go over 30 hours with no sleep? :P
<pony_9709> O_O

<xxMoopyxx> Hey cow334 have you ever been online dude like yesterday man?
<WallDives> Although I havent played you, nor do I know your primary tactics.
<hen3ry> no sleep and something something make hen3ry go crazy. Since Ponies47 started out crazy, this could be bad.

<cow334> hi star
<Lil_B> man, why cant I convert "Cupcakes.flac" into mp3 :(
<Lil_B> hi Starflash ;)
<Spell-of-Gaming> I'm waiting for the iOS 80 where Apple will finally announce Flash on their devices.
<Ponies47> Hi Starflash! I has been up for 38 hours and 6 min strraight :P
<Ponies47> *straight
<Starflash> Gratz Ponies47 :D is that a new record?
<BroKnee> 58:6 /)
<BroKnee> I'm winnning
<Starflash> 2 minutes here :D
<Ponies47> Starflash: eeyep and I'm still going. :)
<BroKnee> Dx it suuuuuuuuuuuck
<CrimsonPhoenix> this game is cool
<CrimsonPhoenix> Final boss is disapointing though
<somepony> this game ended too quickly
<cow334> BroKnee: well then i see no point in playing the game yall two are doing
<CrimsonPhoenix> and yeah
<CrimsonPhoenix> it was very short
<Lil_B> Spell-of-Gaming theys won't Flash is unstable, very unsecure and (jusging by the current trends) abselete for Video-Viewing in the Internet in a few years
<cow334> BroKnee: just listen to me when i say this real quick
<CrimsonPhoenix> even with the extra missions
<somepony> i expected more bosses
<BroKnee> cow334 to prove who is superior :p
<CrimsonPhoenix> I expected more act
<cow334> BroKnee: nonono like let me explian
<BroKnee> cow334 okhai
<Lil_B> hey a Trailer for the new Amnesia game :O
<CrimsonPhoenix> and yeah a boss at the end of the zone would be better
<Phase4> 00,02Lil_B, i blame internet explorer for it not being obsolete now
<Ponies47> Never played Sonic Generations :$
<Phase4> 00,02that and the mpeg consortium
<CrimsonPhoenix> like a memorable boss for each game that the zone represent
<somepony> ^
<Lil_B> Phase4 I use Maxthon, I like the new Option in Youtube to be a tester for HTML5- Video
<CrimsonPhoenix> I would be ok with the eggball coming back for the millionth time
<cow334> BroKnee: Okay you no how you been up longer then Ponies47 well that is not fair cause a game like that is sopossed to be were you start at the SAME EXACT TIME cause if you dont then NO MATTER HOW MUCH Ponies47 AND YOU STAY UP TOGETHER HE WILL ALWAYS BE LOSING cause you have more ahead of him in staying up so my opionion
<Phase4> 00,02ok, i dont know if this streams
<Ascendant> I am officially too bored to do maths work now
<Ascendant> So I'm going to game instead
<Ascendant> Exponential differentiation/integration is so easy
<CrimsonPhoenix> Holy cow334 that was hard on my brain
<Phase4> 00,02can you guys see the game?
<OtakuTom> I don't :(
<Phase4> 00,02DAMNIT
<BroKnee> cow334 nononono thats not how it is, we both stayed up along time then I said "Lets have a compeition to see who can stay up longer starting now" So I've been up longer but it doesnt count
<Ponies47> cow334: It's true :"(
<Ponies47> :'(
<Phase4> 00,02Y U NO STREAM
<cow334> Phase4: the stream is laggin
<cow334> lagging
<cow334> BroKnee: well what you just said DOSENT MAKE ANY SENCE AT ALL NOW in my opionion
<TrixieBaconMuffin> when i was a little filly and the stream was going dooooown , the blackscreen and the laaaag would always bring me dooown
<BroKnee> cow334 how?
<somepony> cow334: sense
<BroKnee> cow334 We started at a certain time, the time before that does not count
<cow334> BroKnee: GIVE ME A SECOND TO PROVE YOU WRONG THEN
<OtakuTom> There we go, though the stream is constantly cutting out right now...dunno if that's from the game breaking the screen or if it's something else.
<CrimsonPhoenix> aaaaand off to bed so for one last time. http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/328/167/ab1.png This picture has pique my interest for some reason even though I'm sure it's nothing official.
<BroKnee> cow334 Gives you 1 second....your time is up
<Lil_B> 30min until I'll go to my first Brony meetup :3
<OtakuTom> CrimsonPhoenix: I have my doubts about it's legitimacy...everyone knows chickens can't fly :P
<Phase4> 00,02i'm going to assume this is working
<CrimsonPhoenix> OtakuTom, Joke aside
<Ponies47> Lil_B: That sounds like fun. I wish I had bronies to hang out with :'(
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dear Princess Celestia, today I learned that Android application developers are too lazy to implement Flash on their browsers...
<CrimsonPhoenix> This could be an interesting turn oh the show
<Lil_B> Ponies47 you are hanging around with them right now :)
<Phase4> 00,02excelent, working
<OtakuTom> CrimsonPhoenix: It's still fitting...unless there's gonna be an episode where Scootaloo learns how to, isn't Scootaloo unable to fly?
<Ponies47> Lil_B: *squees* SO TRUE! :D

<Ponies47> Why is this game so much fun anways?
<Sumica> 00,10and flaps are broke as fuck
<cow334> Phase4: it is okay if you explode you should have seen Sumica each one he made went BOOM it was halarious :D
<Spell-of-Gaming> So wait... a whip is as strong as a Sonic Rainboom?
<OtakuTom> Add a vertical fin for stability, and maybe some wheels to help prevent the cockpit from exploding upon landing?
<Invi> Sumica OtakuTom war right: it's Kerbal, not Kepler ^^
<Sumica> 00,10I have managed to fly one safely, just not on stream and it never got more then 12km up

*Evil_Spike steps back from MegaMoonShine
<LightTrooper105> Phase4 whats this game or simulation called?
<Starchaser> its working
<Phase4> 00,02kerbal space program
<LightTrooper105> thank you
<Evil_Spike> IT WORKED!
<LightTrooper105> to tha moon!
<OtakuTom> I have both a 3DS and Vita. It depends on what types of games you want to play. There's a lot of great Vita games you can play on the Vita, and all the DS titles are playable on the 3DS.
<alexxm> happy birthd Rushgamez what did you get
<OtakuTom> You have to rebuy the PSP games, though.
<alexxm> to the sun
<Evil_Spike> BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYATC!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Rushgamez> nothing yet:D im home alone:d
<LightTrooper105> OtakuTom that the problem i want to own both but in my choicing i would go vita first
<diddutz1> that even looks like a proper rocket
<LightTrooper105> OtakuTom 3ds can come after if they have a redesign.
<Evil_Spike> I think the Vita is going to suffer the same issues the PSP did
<OtakuTom> I've already played my Vita more than I ever did my PSP, Evil_Spike...lol
<Evil_Spike> There is no reason for me to consider getting a vita at the moment
<LightTrooper105> ok it dicided Ps vita first then 3ds after it get a redesign..
<FairysHuff> Morning ponies one and all. I greet you with a loving call. ^_^
<WallDives> good morning, FairysHuff.
<Reddhero12> It's 3 AM here
<Reddhero12> xD
<LightTrooper105> hello OtakuTom
<OtakuTom> The 3DS's design is good enough as it is, though I wish I could get my hands on the 2nd joypay attachment. Trying to play Kid Icarus without it can be a pain. Beyond that, I haven't played a game where I thought the controls were bad.
<LightTrooper105> wops
<FairysHuff> 3am is still morning ^_^
<Evil_Spike> It's 6:15PM here in Perth
<LightTrooper105> hello FairysHuff
<MegaMoonShine> Morning FairysHuff
<Evil_Spike> And I'm going to get myself some subway in about 20 minutes
<Reddhero12> Luckeh
<Reddhero12> I'm starving
<Reddhero12> Lol
<LightTrooper105> OtakuTom i know the 3ds design is good enough allready the fact is the 2nd controller got to me convern if I should get it now
<Evil_Spike> Because when you live on your own, you can do that
<FairysHuff> It's a lovely summer day here in Scotland. The rain is lashing down. The wind is whipping the trees. ^_^ I love it.
<Evil_Spike> Also, you can buy gaming consoles which are exactly the same age as you
<Evil_Spike> Mega Drive, anypony?
<Phase4> 00,02Success
<Phase4> 00,02in orbit
<Scarlet> Nice
*LightTrooper105 appalus
<Scarlet> Grats
<Reddhero12> Nice
<Reddhero12> Sooo
<FairysHuff> I'm Older than a megadrive ^_^ I think by about 6 or 7 years
<Phase4> 00,02with plenty of fule left
<Reddhero12> Now what?
<Reddhero12> xD
<Evil_Spike> Well done Phase
<Phase4> 00,02little under two tanks
<MegaMoonShine> Congratulations!
<LightTrooper105> somepony get the cider! its time to celibrate!
<Phase4> 00,02now what
<WIRGL> wrg
<Reddhero12> Now come down to earth
<derpy_pony> stranded forever
<Reddhero12> and crash
<Reddhero12> xD
<OtakuTom> My only complaint about the Vita is the whole thing with them cancelling the PSP register/download feature...really makes me angry that I have to rebuy all the titles I want to play...the battery life on the Vita is so much better than the PSP.
<Evil_Spike> Wait, it's older than me by about 2 or 3 years
<Phase4> 00,02clearly i should leave the engin in orbit
<diddutz1> Phase4: Is it possible to set the audio options to headphones, cause i hear the engines either on the right OR the left side and this starts hurting my ears ...
<Thorn> THE NEW MOON..
<Phase4> 00,02diddutz1, i'm not sure
<WIRGL> x
<Reddhero12> GO FIND LUNA
<LightTrooper105> OtakuTom I have to agree on that but im lucky i only own 2 original game.. while other are pirated :)
<OtakuTom> lol
<FairysHuff> Evil_Spike: HAH! Your old like me ^_^
<OtakuTom> I have a few import games on my PSP that I'll have to keep playing on that. Oh! Speaking of which, the Vita is also region free, so you can import games there, too :)
<OtakuTom> Sadly, the 3DS is region locked...I've got a few import games on my normal DS that I still play.
<FairysHuff> I can't use handhelds. They strain my eyes.
<Thorn> 3RD ASTRONAUGHT FARTED
<Phase4> 00,02ready for re-entry

<Reddhero12> Speed dem times up
<Phase4> 00,02i want to land on land
<Om> FairysHuff: Same here. And I really do *need* them, less everything looks like it got fuzzified
<OtakuTom> I dunno...I like Thorn's idea...one farted and just doesn't care while the other 2 have to live with it XD
<alexxm> so do we have one orbiting the sun again

<Sumica> 00,10it's very buggy
<Phase4> 00,0220K
<WallDives> FairysHuff, then you shouldnt take those.
<Dumori> Really add two more boosters and angle tehm down 12 degrees
<Dumori> you should take off then
<Sumica> 00,10the engins will stall at 26k
<FairysHuff> WallDives: Yup. They don't seem to work anyways
<Sumica> 00,10no air

<FairysHuff> BroKnee: I'm going to go play NWN in a bit if I don't fall sleep
<LightTrooper105> NWN?
<Spell-of-Gaming> Trying out a game by pirating it is the closest way to trying it out properly. :P
<BroKnee> FairyHuff whats that
<BroKnee> ?
<Dark_Horst> that flip wouldve broken their necks
<Spell-of-Gaming> Demos kinda suck.
<LightTrooper105> Spell-of-Gaming yo ho ho a pirate for me
<Reddhero12> and then they're stranded in the ocean
<Reddhero12> FOREVER
<FairysHuff> BroKnee: Never Winter Nights
<BroKnee> FairysHuff Never heard of it
<FairysHuff> BroKnee: You can get it for $10 on GOG.com
<LightTrooper105> kia..
<FairysHuff> BroKnee: Tis just a pc D&D rpg.
<Malavolent> It is also a plane simulator now?
<alexxm> they always die in this game
<Flutterchu> im trixie rocking to the show got some magic ticks so here we go, were gonna have some FUN hold on to your hats
<Dark_Horst> cute
<diddutz> Phase4: Now you're playing H.A.W.X
<FairysHuff> BroKnee: If you like magic, fantasy and customising your own character its the game for you.
<BroKnee> FairysHuff Sounds like my game, depending on the types of magic
<derpy_pony> bigger delta wings?
<Dark_Horst> you lost some chutes there
<Om> FairysHuff: You know you are a gamer when you can have a sentence contain more abriviations than words
<Spell-of-Gaming> FairysHuff: I thought we had iOS and Android apps for that...
<FairysHuff> BroKnee: It's D&D based so it has all types ^_^
<FairysHuff> Om: Too true ^_^
<BroKnee> FairysHuff Blood magic? :p
<LightTrooper105> D&D Do and Die?
<WallDives> Lawful Neutral, what?
<FairysHuff> Spell-of-Gaming: WIth the what now?
<Malavolent> Lulz.
<FairysHuff> BroKnee: Necromancy.
<alexxm> that was quick
<FairysHuff> LightTrooper105: Dungeons and Dragons.
<BroKnee> FairysHuff Blood magic and Necromancy are very different :)
<Flutterchu> um
<Spell-of-Gaming> LIGHTNING BOLT
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...
<Spell-of-Gaming> Flutterchu?
<WallDives> Magic Missile at the darkness.
<alexxm> i'm assuming thats not good
<Phase4> 00,02this is not working
<Spell-of-Gaming> Oh my...
<LightTrooper105> why am I finding Phase4 blowing his ship or plan funny..
<Flutterchu> yes
<FairysHuff> BroKnee: in D&D you can mix and match everything. Much more customisable that DAO.
<Malavolent> Sooo many deaths.
<alexxm> why do they keep coming back just to die
<Phase4> 00,02why does the left wing allways lift
<MadSurge> Ho-hum, just another day at Kerbal space program. K. I. A.
<BroKnee> FairysHuff Idk what DAO is xD
<FairysHuff> Dragon Age Origins
<derpy_pony> put the wheels in the wings
<Malavolent> I find it hilarious how people die in experimental planes.
<Evil_Spike> Cooking food while listening to pony music
<Evil_Spike> It is awesome
<MadSurge> BOOOOOOM
<FairysHuff> OH! OH! OOOOH!!! Every pony! Could we start a regular D&D get together? ^_^
<FairysHuff> Pleeeeeeeeeeeease#?
<FairysHuff> I has no one to plays with. ~_~
<d3rb-ZZZzzz> something must be off centre
<alexxm> can we have cave johnson commetating on this
<Evil_Spike> I'm already in a Savage Worlds pony campaign
<MadSurge> FairysHuff: If you do I'll be the ignorant noob. :D
<Kriel_Pony> Hi Everypony!
<alexxm> is savage worlds goof Evil_Spike
*SuperBrony64 hugs FairysHuff
<MadSurge> Ohai Kriel_Pony!
<Spell-of-Gaming> Ohai Kriel_Pony
<alexxm> hey Kriel_Pony hows your day been
<FairysHuff> MadSurge: Don't worry, I've only ever played D&D on PC games like Baldurs Gate ^_^
<Evil_Spike> It's relatively easy to learn
<MadSurge> Dat SuperBrony64 :3
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dat SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O.O
<FairysHuff> I tried learning the 3.5 rules but too confusing. So switched to 4
<Evil_Spike> But I've been planning on starting a Fallout Equestria campaign using Cortex system rules
<Kriel_Pony> pretty good, alexxm! Well, mostly spent on a programming project, but it is DONE, so NOW im in a pretty good mood!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Dat me O~O
<Evil_Spike> 4th ed sycjs
<Evil_Spike> EDIT sucks
<OtakuTom> 3.5 ed > 4th ed
<alexxm> good to hear Kriel_Pony what was the project
<MegaMoonShine> Hey, I'm back!
<Evil_Spike> Indeed
<FairysHuff> Evil_Spike: I wouldn't know. I've only ever played the PC games.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Damn you, government
<Evil_Spike> Has anypony ever used the Cortex system?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I'm off to bed, night all ^-^
<Kriel_Pony> Just a project for school, programming matrix concatenation
<Phase4> 00,02gnight SuperBrony64
<Malavolent> I'd like to play D&D in person someday.
<Phase4> 00,02sleep well
<Evil_Spike> Baldur's Gate I believe is based either off D&D 3rd ed or 3.5e
<alexxm> bye SuperBrony64
<FairysHuff> SuperBrony64: Nighty night
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I will ^-^
<Kriel_Pony> Nothing major, jsut more time than I would like bughunting
<Spell-of-Gaming> Bai SuperBrony64
<Evil_Spike> Night SuperBrony64
<Kriel_Pony> night SuperBrony64
<Kriel_Pony> so, what are we watching here?
<FairysHuff> Evil_Spike: No. BG is based on second edition as they still have THACO
<Evil_Spike> Ah
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dear government, why did you have to implement the K-12 system in our country
<Evil_Spike> I'm not completely learned in Tabletop RPGs
<FairysHuff> Evil_Spike: NWN1 uses 3.0 and NWN2 uses 3.5
<FairysHuff> Evil_Spike: Neither am I. I learned all I know from the PC games ^_^ LOL
<Evil_Spike> Malevolent, just visit your local uni, I'm sure there will be a few people who want to run a D&D campaign
<Evil_Spike> Or geek shop
<FairysHuff> Evil_Spike: If your talking to me I don't like just turning up at a place with strangers.
<Malavolent> Evil_Spike: Neither of these things is close to me.
<FairysHuff> Evil_Spike: I'd want to people I atleast vageuely know
<FairysHuff> *Play
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: Well, then jsut make your friends play!
<Phase4> 00,02that ran out of fuel fast
<Evil_Spike> Are you part of any brony groups?
<Sumica> 00,10arrow spikes sure run out of fuel fast dont they
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: I don't have any
<Malavolent> Phase4: That thing is supposed to get into space?
<Evil_Spike> Fial
<Phase4> 00,02Malavolent, no, this is a plane
<FairysHuff> Evil_Spike: Me?
<Phase4> 00,02my spacecraft are marginly more successfull
<MadSurge> Well they didn't die, at least
<Malavolent> Awww.
<Evil_Spike> You or Malavolent
<Malavolent> Has anyone get to the moon?
<Spell-of-Gaming> I have a classmate who knows a lot about the internet, she's a girl. :P
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: Well ,then the geek shop option can kill two birds with one stone. Visit regularly, buy some dice, maybie a book or two, and chat people up. Get to know them, THEN game with them.
<FairysHuff> Evil_Spike: I just joined the Edinburgh Group online yesterday.
<Evil_Spike> Ask if anypony is running a campaign or thinking of running one.
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: ever treid to build a rocket with a plane strapped to it?
<Evil_Spike> Then ask if you can join
<derpy_pony> haha
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: Sadly the only geek shop near here is one that only plays Warhammer ^_^ And nothing else.
<Malavolent> Gotta love the explosions
<Phase4> 00,02Dark_Horst, nope
<MadSurge> YAYYY ALL DEAD :D
<Evil_Spike> No Magic The Gathering locations?
<derpy_pony> not sure if this is even possible here, Dark_Horst
<cow334> Night every one
<Evil_Spike> Night cow334
<derpy_pony> night cow334
<Kriel_Pony> Kriel_Pony: Shame about that... Lets see... I met one group I gamed with at the local community college where my friend was going
<alexxm> bye cow334
<BroKnee> Night cow334 wubs for ye <3
<Kriel_Pony> Why did I jsut send that to ME?
<derpy_pony> spinning is bad for you
<MegaMoonShine> Night cow334
<Evil_Spike> Most unis have a gaming club
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: Because your lost... IN THE INCEPTION! O_O
<OtakuTom> Why is it that all my engines or boosters are significantly smaller in size compared to the rest of my ship? Is there an option to resize them or anything?
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: Um... im running out of options... -I- would offer, but the odds of being geographically close to someone online is astronomical
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: Very true. ^_^ Scotland?
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: Sorry, USA
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: I thought that ^_^
<Cypresswolf> :) I just realized I have no hangover repercussions from last night - Huzzah!
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: Oh, shit, is my American showing?
<FairysHuff> Not many play here in the UK
<alexxm> so what did you guys think of black sheep
<Spell-of-Gaming> ...Meh.
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: Nah. Don't worry, your warbanner isn't loose ^_~
<alexxm> Fairyshuff where in the uk are you
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Scotland Central.
<alexxm> i'm in croydon myself
<Cypresswolf> strangely I dont remember much of the movie stream....I do remember Black Sheep
<FairysHuff> I'm in hell myself ^_^ LOL
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: I thoguht hell was in the caribbean....
<Cypresswolf> what happened to the other B movie? non existent or last minute change?
<Evil_Spike> No, that's only when the rum is gone
<Vordox> lawl?
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: Nope. It's a small town in scotland completely over-run by NEDs >_> Grrr... wish we could own guns.
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: My American is showing again. I had to google what a Ned is.
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: Non Educated Delinquant. Scottish term. Search it and look at google images. You'll get the idea
<MadSurge> Ok guys, checking out for a while. See you at least for European Movie Night! :)
<FairysHuff> In England they are called Chavs.
<FairysHuff> Council House and Violence.
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: I think around here we just call them douchebags...
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: If I had a gun I'd call them target practice.
<Vordox> Tripodular Sets, Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02?
<derpy_pony> this cant fail
<Spectrum_Rush> seems legit
<MegaMoonShine> :D
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: I could get a gun, but honestly I am PRETTY sure I would shoot myself.
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: Positives and negatives to having guns legal.
<derpy_pony> xtreme spinning
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: Self defence is a + but then every nut job having a gun is a -
<Sumica> 00,10damn buffer
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: Yup. And me NOT getting a gun because I don't trust myself to use it responsibly is an important part of gun regulation.
<WallDives> yay for owning a gun.
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: Yup. Crossbows and bows are legal here in the UK though ^_^
<derpy_pony> carrying a gun where everybody else isn't allowed to is best
<Phase4> 00,02hmm
<FairysHuff> I could do some old fashioned medieval NED hunting ^_^
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: Ohhhhh, target practice it is, then!
<Phase4> 00,02i think the stream silently failed
<Phase4> 00,02back up now
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: If the police stop you, simply explain that you are contributing to the gene pool as a whole.
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: One problem... The meds I'm on cause muscle weakness which equals extremely poor aim ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02props to Sumica for the craft
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: That is what bipods are for.
<Sumica> 00,10this can only end in laughter
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: I'd probably get a commendation
<Sumica> 00,10it totaly worked on bebop
<Spectrum_Rush> stay on target
<Phase4> 00,02seems legit
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: Can't use a bi-pod with a bow. And cross-bows aren't accurate to begin with.
<MegaMoonShine> Dafuq? :D
<Sumica> 00,10nose boosters
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: atleast you stayed on target
<Sumica> 00,10I should probably build a sepration system
<Sumica> 00,10that is so gonna over heat
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: I don't even know if you can get bi-pods for crossbows. O_o
<LightningDashFast> wat
<Sumica> 00,10meltdown
<LightningDashFast> all of my wat
<Spectrum_Rush> phase cut
<Phase4> 00,02this is a smidge unsafe
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: There are some accurate crossbows out there. And you can indeed get bipods for them. Once, for a school assignment, I guilt a crossbow out of scrap metal fro man old truck. Found some site online with bipods. this WAS years ago.
<Spectrum_Rush> the enginse
<ZombieBrony> Wat?
<Vordox> A...smidge...a SMIDGE?!
<Sumica> 00,10have to throttle down to use the chutes
<Ninjazz> *cough* do a barrel roll *cough*
<Ninjazz> >.>
<Ninjazz> <.<
<Om> Ninjazz: >.>
<Kriel_Pony> Ninjazz: Yes, Sir!
<Cypresswolf> I like the physics in that last one - the thrusters didnt burn off the parachutes :)
<Ninjazz> :$
<MegaMoonShine> Use the boost to get through!
<LightningDashFast> slippy is worst sentient being
<Majestic_Sparkler> lol DO a barrol roll
<Vordox> It's too back heavy
<Majestic_Sparkler> XD
<FairysHuff> Kriel_Pony: Damn you got the skills yo O_o
<Kriel_Pony> I can't let you do that, star fox.
<Phase4> 00,02it makes a nice boat
<Sumica> 00,10indeed
<MegaMoonShine> I'm on a boat!
<Sumica> 00,10I keep trying to get it to the water with out breaking off the boosters
<Cypresswolf> :D that multi billion dollar boat
<Kriel_Pony> FairysHuff: It wasnt too tough. My school had a metal shop.
<MegaMoonShine> Everybody look at me cause I'm sailing on a boat!
<TrixieBaconMuffin> never thought i'd be on a boat , its a big bluewatery road
<Kriel_Pony> MegaMoonShine: riding on a dolphin, doing flips and shit
<Cypresswolf> -_- so sleepy...
<LightningDashFast> you're good but i'm better
<Vordox> I wonder, Sumica, what if you angled the wings within the graviation pull of earth, would that not be a permanent uplift during the Earth Atmospherical reach?
<Spectrum_Rush> FUN FACT: what people think is a barrel roll is in fact not, it is a Airleron Roll. a barrel roll is something entirely different
<Phase4> 00,02i should probably not be attempting to make this work
<Sumica> 00,10you dont have that much control over parts
<Vordox> Phase4: Try and lif the sidewings JUSt a smidge upwards so they look like a extended V?
<Vordox> Sumica: You should be able to, can't you make the wings into a V shape? A very vide V?
<Om> nope
<derpy_pony> lol
<Rain> a back flip? thats not good
<Kriel_Pony> Clearly a success.
<Spectrum_Rush> needs more thrust
<Kriel_Pony> This IS designing a method of effectively killing the crew, right?
<Rain> too much in the back and not enough in the front
<Spectrum_Rush> ...or less
<Vordox> If I understand the physics of our world's logic, it should have pemanent uplift with the aerodynamic supporting the central force of the propupulsion....
<Vordox> Damnit, now I want this game. :P
<Spectrum_Rush> Rain: some people like it that way
<Spectrum_Rush> :S
<Kriel_Pony> What IS this game?
<MegaMoonShine> Kriel_Pony: Kerbal Space Program
<LightningDashFast> it looks like the space shuttle doesnt it?
<Vordox> Phase4: Can you try something?
<alexxm> inb4 it orbits the sun
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, yeah
<TrixieBaconMuffin> too much in the back , not enough in the front ? so its a mulletcraft ?
<Vordox> The front wings, can you move them into a V, a very very wide V shape?
<Phase4> 00,02not sure what you meen
<Vordox> Or do they HAVE to be horizontal?
<LightningDashFast> dont know if works
<derpy_pony> no elevator on the right wing?
<LightningDashFast> gonna splode
<Vordox> It's too back/top heavy
<Phase4> 00,02i have no vertical controlls XD
<Vordox> Not this time though :P
<derpy_pony> no elevators at all
<LightningDashFast> yea knew it
<Spectrum_Rush> eueu so close
<Rain> well that ended about as expected
<TrixieBaconMuffin> From now on i dub this craft , The SPACEMULLET
<Vordox> Is this game free to play?
<Spectrum_Rush> lol
<LightningDashFast> it cant get enough lift its to heavy
*Sumica glomps and hugs Rain
<Rain> :3
<Rain> hello Sumica, how has your day been so far?
<Phase4> 00,02gota go have dinner soon
<Sumica> 00,10wait you got the flaps to work?!

<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> I decided to hold myself to much stricter standards. The following day, an unkind word from another user drove me to ban myself for 16 hours. I kind of made a bit of an indiscriminate move a couple of times, so I added more time to the ban. It became 96 hours
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Just lie in bed and try. Even if it doesn't work, your body will eventually adapt. :(
<|Discord|> This is gonna be so awesome!
<Ninjazz> I'll try...
<d3rb_> hang on, you implemented a self ban on yourself?
*GilDash hugs Ninjazz.
<Om> Ninjazz: It will al work out xD
<Mutterguy> |Discord| or messy!!!
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Yes
<d3rb_> ok fair enough
<RaveBrony> :o
<|Discord|> Mutterguy: Most likely both
<GilDash> Ninjazz: As long as you're *really* trying and not lying to me, I'll never be disappointed. :)
<Obsidian> To the mooooooooooooooooon!
<Ninjazz> GilDash, okay then. ^_^
<LightningDashFast> success
<Mutterguy> yeah that can cheerfully escape the olar system
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Within an hour of the ban lifting, I AGAIN made a jerk of myself, right in the middle of BMN.
<d3rb_> lol, so more time i guess wasadded
<Om> GilDash: How did you sleep? When ya know...You eventualy did go to sleep :$
<GilDash> Om: I slept. Borning as usual. :S
<GilDash> *Boring
<Ninjazz> Dat misspell.
<Om> I born in my sleep.
<Sylandest> hmm...borning....
<Spectrum_Rush> birth by sleep
<Spectrum_Rush> :S
<GilDash> ... Gimme a break guys. I *just* woke up. :D
<LightningDashFast> ICBM
*Sylandest hugs GilDash
<Om> GilDash: Nevar!
<Mutterguy> So 1/4 of the way into space
<Sylandest> GilDash: I just woke up too, actually :D
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Well, my interpretation of Bronystate rules say that each punishment has to be worse than the last.
<Ninjazz> GilDash, when were you one for taking breaks?
<LightningDashFast> to the mooooonnnn
<Obsidian> lol those pilots
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It's called sleep, Ninjazz. :(
<Spectrum_Rush> TO LUNA!!!!!!!!!
*Ninjazz sighs
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Some of us need it more than others it seems...
<Ninjazz> Always with you and my sleep problems...
<WindWhistler> Oh, the launch is actually successful this time?
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I worry and care. :)
<Om> Ninjazz: Yes in deed.
<LightningDashFast> uhoh
<WindWhistler> How come the cameras on the three guys are lagging when the actual stream isn't lagging?
<GilDash> WindWhistler: That's how it is in game.
<Obsidian> But its not going to Luna. :(
<Ninjazz> GilDash, I appreciate it. I really do.
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: we merely look to take care of you, as you would do for us :)
<WindWhistler> GilDash: Well, that's slightly annoying.
<Spectrum_Rush> WindWhistler: 'cause
<Ninjazz> Sylandest, I try here and there. :$
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> I basically consider each timed ban to be in increments of 16 hour blocks. And each subsequent ban be either one more block than the last or twice as many blocks as the last.
<Om> I shall say nothing on this topic!
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I'm not looking for anything in return. As long as you're happy, I'm happy. ;)
<LightningDashFast> orbit
<WindWhistler> This game is very confusing.
<d3rb_> so did you learn your self impossed lesson Kandarihu|BuddyBear ?
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> I'm thinking I'm being too strict with myself.
*Ninjazz restrains to state he is never happy
<WindWhistler> Who chose these cowardly pilots?
<Mutterguy> SPACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCEE
<d3rb_> i agree Kandarihu|BuddyBear
<Obsidian> uh oh
<GilDash> Kandarihu|BuddyBear: Probably. Just chill and have fun. :)
<d3rb_> ^
<Om> Ninjazz: You were happy this morning ._.
<WindWhistler> WE'RE LOST IN SPACE
<WindWhistler> WHERE'S MS. FRIZZLE!?
*Spectrum_Rush slaps Ninjazz
*GilDash snuggles Ninjazz.
<Ninjazz> I was?
*Sylandest hugs Ninjazz
*Ninjazz sighs
<d3rb_> the magic space bus!
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> But if I'm not as strict, I go back to being a troublemaker again.
<Ninjazz> You guys... :)
<Phase4> 00,02shit
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: you shall be happy, from all the wubs we give ya! :D
<LightningDashFast> magic scool bus
<Phase4> 00,02going too fast
<WindWhistler> This is all Janet's fault.
<Obsidian> they are so dead
<Om> Sylandest: We?
<Phase4> 00,02and out of fuel
<Phase4> 00,02so ditching back to the planet it is
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Why do I always drag you down with my sleep talks? :(
<Sylandest> Om: well, there's me, you, GilDash...thats a good start
<WindWhistler> Now they have to go all the way to Pluto to find Ms. Frizzle and get back to school.
<LightningDashFast> oh i knew i should have stayed home today
<Cypresswolf> Inb4 they realize the moon is the other way
<Obsidian> abandon ship?
<d3rb_> the pilots know it, they are screwed
<Ninjazz> GilDash, you make me think about it... :(
<Om> Sylandest: I preffer to think of it as friendly support :$
<WindWhistler> How are they still getting miles?
<Cypresswolf> Rocket Men! Burning out thier fuse out here alone....
<Mutterguy> I hope you have plently of OXYGEN! you know... for the crew...
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It's in my nature. Even if I have to be cruel to be kind. :(
<Om> All this sleep talk is making me tired e_e
<Obsidian> They're still going
<Phase4> 00,02perfect
<LightningDashFast> LOST IN SPACE
<Phase4> 00,02orbit lines up with the moons
<WindWhistler> LightningDashFast: I already said that.
<Ninjazz> GilDash, then I shall react how I feel. :(
<Sylandest> Om: fair enough, lol
<WindWhistler> So then they'll eventually get to the moon?
<Phase4> 00,02eventualy
<Phase4> 00,02i meen, months and months in ideal circumstances
<WindWhistler> Is there a way to speed up time?
<Phase4> 00,02but yeah
<LightningDashFast> i wonder if we will ever go back to the moon
<Phase4> 00,02it just so happens there is :3
<GilDash> Ninjazz: You'll drag me down with you, but I'll keep pushing anyway. I'm too stubborn. :(
<Mutterguy> yeah they have abbout 2-3 weeks....
<d3rb_> that costs money which no one has
<WindWhistler> But they'll probably die by then.
<oni_link> hello everypony :)
<Phase4> 00,02the real problem is a: my useless engines
<Phase4> 00,02abd b: this orbit decends into the atmosphere
<Phase4> 00,02and'
<WindWhistler> But hey, at least they'll reach the moon.
<Cypresswolf> WindWhistler: Eventually, it may take a few trips to land though
<Ninjazz> GilDash, that will only make me feel worse. :'(
*Sylandest sighs before hugging Ninjazz and GilDash tight
<WindWhistler> So I looked this game up on Steam, only to find it isn't on there.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It will me too. I only hope you'll do something about it. :(
<Sylandest> Ninjazz, GilDash: you two ponies need to perk up. We're all here, and we're all together. We should be happy for that, no?
<Phase4> 00,02so....
<Phase4> 00,02those engines will return to the earth in....
<GilDash> Phase4: Wouldn't going directly upwards help? Or is there something about physics I don't understand? :S
<Om> Ninjazz: Buuuu. Just eat some toast!
<Phase4> 00,0212 hours
<Ninjazz> I suppose so, Syl.
<WindWhistler> Wai, why am I red in your chat? I wanna be green!
<Mutterguy> that's goona leave a mark Phase4
<Phase4> 00,02its in an orbit
<WindWhistler> wait*
<Phase4> 00,02Mutterguy, in the ocean
<Ninjazz> Om, I ran out of bread! :'(
<Cypresswolf> That's a huge piece of space debri
<Phase4> 00,02though that was pure luck
<Obsidian> can we ff
<Om> Ninjazz: ._.
<Mutterguy> you hope...
*GilDash snuggles Ninjazz tightly.
<Phase4> 00,02no, i know :P
<WindWhistler> Wait, there's another shuttle out there?
<Phase4> 00,02it shows the orbital path
<WindWhistler> So you have six guys stranded in space?
<Phase4> 00,02WindWhistler, thats debre
<Phase4> 00,02debrie
<WindWhistler> Oh.
<Phase4> 00,02i cannot spell
<Obsidian> WindWhistler: three
<LightningDashFast> debris
<WindWhistler> debris*
<Phase4> 00,02there are others stranded in space though
*Ninjazz sighs contently at all the affection he is receiving
<Phase4> 00,02about 6 to 12
<WindWhistler> You horrible person. :|
<Obsidian> lol
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: no matter what happens, you always got us :)
<Cypresswolf> at half a million feet, I dont see it gravitating back to earth - at what point does Earth's gravity end and Space begin?
<d3rb_> but its for SCIENCE!
<Phase4> 00,02there goes my engines
<GilDash> WindWhistler: Hey, *they* volunteered. :D
<Phase4> 00,02oh well, time warp time
<Om> Ninjazz: Unless ya know.
<Mutterguy> ASA: No Worries mate!
<Phase4> 00,02i just realised that this rocket has no way to land
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: your problem tell me... i fix for you
<WindWhistler> GilDash: They got assigned to a terrible person.
<Phase4> 00,02oh well
<WindWhistler> Phase4: I'm ashamed of you.
<d3rb_> MEH....slight technicality
<LightningDashFast> crash landing
<GilDash> WindWhistler: They got to live their dream! They got into space!
<Cypresswolf> Phase4: that's what water landings are for
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, sleep, I guess. I can't get a good night sleep.
<GilDash> WindWhistler: Well, some of them... :D
<Ninjazz> And I know, Sylandest.
<Phase4> 00,02Cypresswolf, i'm going for the moon
<WindWhistler> GilDash: They look awfullly terrified.
<WindWhistler> awfully*
<WindWhistler> Can you get to other planets?
<GilDash> WindWhistler: They're *always* terrified. :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: iknow that problem i have that problem
<Obsidian> THose engine will burn up in the atmosphere.......... right?
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: ok heres waht ya do
<WindWhistler> oh hay, the moon is slightly moving.
<Cypresswolf> Phase4: Tell them the mission has changed, they're a space colony now
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> So, how much of this capsule can be considered as living quarters? How long can the Kerbals be expected to survive?
<Phase4> 00,02allmost time for another burn
<WindWhistler> Ah, they're not gonna make it, are they?
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: figure out when is the hours you need to be awake school,work,watev
<LightningDashFast> 3rd phase
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, I'm in summer vacation.
<Phase4> 00,02oh shit
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Then you've no excuse. :(
<Phase4> 00,02wrong buton
<Phase4> 00,02button'
<WindWhistler> 'Tuh oh
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh shi-
<Phase4> 00,02i seperated from my engine XD
<Vordox[Spriting]> XD
<WindWhistler> Now they're really screwed.
<Obsidian> Panic time
<d3rb_> Ninjazz: then whats the problem..stay up forver!
<dalekkahn> geeeegeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
<WindWhistler> Nice job breaking it, Hero.
<Phase4> 00,02oh well

<Vordox[Spriting]> TO the ,...not moon: :P
<LightningDashFast> oh shi-
<Mutterguy> Adelaide... We have a problem
<WindWhistler> TO DEATH
<Obsidian> Lets hope they make it.
<LightningDashFast> uh oh
<Mutterguy> ooooh that's gonna be bumpy
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: ok you need to either A. stay up until the time were falling asleep would result in you waking up in the morn
<d3rb_> oh god if addelaide is mission control they may as well be dead already
<WindWhistler> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/5289/
<Phase4> 00,02not too far from land
<LightningDashFast> reentry
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<Phase4> 00,02no re-entry animation
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: or B> sleeping for a amount of time that would result in you waking up early
<LightningDashFast> lol
<Sylandest> ohgod that face
<Phase4> 00,02oh cool
<Phase4> 00,02i heard my engines land
<Mutterguy> you don't need to manually remeber parachuates right?
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, I've tried that a few times. In the end my sleep cycles keep conflicting with when I need to be awake.
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: granted you'd miss a day withh that second one
<Mr_Bubbles> BOOM!
<Obsidian> well at least they land in water
<LightningDashFast> success
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<Cypresswolf> Success!
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: and the first is... not fun
<WindWhistler> Shouldn't you apply the floats?
<Obsidian> They live. Yay!

<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: ya gots to relax
<GilDash> Ninjazz: That's why you plan stuff out. If you're not getting 7 hours minimum you've got *too* much on.
*Kandarihu|BuddyBear facepalms at the all-caps
<LightningDashFast> now time for apollo 11
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: when its time that you need to sleep do not play any game or watch anything
<d3rb_> Ninjazz: have you tried exercising to get yourself tired?
<Mutterguy> Phase4 going to strap on another set of boosters?
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: just turn off your lights lay there
<CupcakeWarrior> So, whats going on with Ninjazz?
<Ninjazz> d3rb, sometimes. It's rather troublsome, actually.
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: even if you cant fall asleep
<LightningDashFast> O.o
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush, I usually sleep when it's bright out.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Wow. Last Starfighter?
<Om> Ninjazz: Sleep is hard xD
<d3rb_> also i dont know what you eat but your diet may have an impact depending on what you consume
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: iknow i have the same problem
<GilDash> Ninjazz: That's because your cycle's so fucked. :|
<Ninjazz> Om, tell me about it... >.>
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: ya got to slowly reaarnge it your cyle
<Om> Ninjazz: How much u wana know?
<LightningDashFast> talk about overkill
<d3rb_> slep is annoying, stops me from doing STUFF and things
*Spectrum_Rush yes iknow grammar fails icant type quickly
<dishwasher_EXTREME> wtf
<Ninjazz> GilDash, truth be told. I sometimes stay up early or late just to see my different friends that are awake during different timezones.
<Mr_Bubbles> how fast do you think it will go "BOOM!" ?
<dishwasher_EXTREME> dat rocket
<CupcakeWarrior> I sleep 5-8 hours a night usually :P
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma do this one again
<Om> GilDash: I'm sure there is minimal fucking in Ninjazz's sleep cycle :D
<Phase4> 00,02its fun
<diddutz> i got the feeling those engines will bend so much they collide and explode
<Phase4> 00,02and looks pwety
<Obsidian> Instantly
<Ninjazz> O__O
*NullRadix looks at stream. I see nothing wrong with this plan.
<d3rb_> its like a snowflake :D
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Then don't. I wouldn't want you to fuck yourself up for me. :(
<LightningDashFast> seem legit
<Ninjazz> GilDash, but...but... but... :(
<Spectrum_Rush> Om: brings up a interesting point Ninjazz
<alexxm> this can only end well
<Obsidian> We're good to go.
<Phase4> 00,02it did
<|Discord|> LOL
<Mr_Bubbles> self destruction in 3... 2... 1...
<alexxm> boom
<GilDash> Ninjazz: But nothing. Do not put yourself out for me. :(
<dishwasher_EXTREME> wtf
<RaveBrony> O_O
<LightningDashFast> way to goooo
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> ROFL
<d3rb_> :D BAAHAHAHAHA
<Obsidian> lol
<diddutz> i saw that coming ^^
<|Discord|> LETS JUST CLUSTER AND HOLY SHIIII......
<Ninjazz> The pain of having too much friends.
<LightningDashFast> total failure
<TrixieBaconMuffin> sonic deathboom
<Om> Ninjazz: You can do it for me!
*CupcakeWarrior hugs Ninjazz
<GilDash> Ninjazz: The pain of being a silly filly. :(
<Ninjazz> Om, you're usually on whenever I'm on. :D
<Mr_Bubbles> AAAAAAGH!!!
<Obsidian> Again
<Mr_Bubbles> whrong way
*Spectrum_Rush tackles Ninjazz
<Cypresswolf> :P It's at this point we've run out of astronauts and are just hiring people of the street
<CupcakeWarrior> ded
<Ninjazz> Oof.
<LightningDashFast> O.O
<Om> Ninjazz: Even though are times are almsot oposite xD
<Ninjazz> Om, Ikr? :D
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Wow. It made a bit of lift that time.
<d3rb_> Ninjazz: maybe you just need to set aside some time for recovery, every other day or once a week just try have a "normal" day to get yourself all fresh again
<Obsidian> lol the center pilot
*Spectrum_Rush stop being difficult :[, sleep:)
<RaveBrony> Roflmao!!! :D
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: ^
<Mr_Bubbles> DIE TOWER!!!
*GilDash snuggles Ninjazz.
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> The problem is that the tower is in the way.
<Mutterguy> 9 astronauts deads
<Cypresswolf> The tower's OK - thank goodness
<Obsidian> 3m new record!
<alexxm> well that went well
<Ninjazz> I appreciate the concern, guys. But I'm wide awake now... :$
<Om> Ninjazz: Just keep breathin! And eating cheese!
<Skylands> 10!pokemon

<GilDash> Mutterguy: NASA: Need Anoth Seven Astronaughts.
<LightningDashFast> yeah i think i can see where this is going:O
<Skylands> 10Yay
<Ninjazz> I don't usually get sleep until around 8 hours from now.
<Ninjazz> Om, I'm almost out of cheese. :'(
<d3rb_> what time is it atm where you are Ninjazz ?
<Im_a_Scatmare> is it moving?
<Im_a_Scatmare> there we go

<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: warm milk, cold shower, at most read a book
*Sylandest gives Ninjazz some cheese from his personal stock
<Im_a_Scatmare> O>O
<Cypresswolf> Maybe if we wrap all the thrusters together with duct tape.....
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Fluttershy and the Seven Kerbals
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: these things will make you tired
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Go to bed at 12. Sleep until 7. Promise me you'll try, and even if you can't sleep you'll just lie there until 7 comes. :(
<Ninjazz> d3rb, 11:08pm.
<Sylandest> Phase4: now you're just doing it for the lols, aren't you? :D
<d3rb_> wait your in australia?
<LightningDashFast> teh lulz
<Cypresswolf> Needs 20% more thrusters
<Ninjazz> GilDash, you're asking something I don't think I can do, GilDash. :O
<Obsidian> If at first you don't succeed, die, die again!
<CupcakeWarrior> Meanwhile in Australia...
<Phase4> 00,02Sylandest, 6_9
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Then do it tomorrow. Please. :(
*Spectrum_Rush slaps Ninjazz
*Ninjazz sighs "Fine"
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: DO IT FILLY
<Ninjazz> Ow.
<LightningDashFast> it will be 20% kewler
*Ninjazz rubs his bruised cheek... "Fine..."

<Mr_Bubbles> omg!
<RaveBrony> Its going!!!
<Im_a_Scatmare> IT WORKS
<Mr_Bubbles> hahahaha

<LightningDashFast> o.o success
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> :D
<RaveBrony> Omg! :D Gogogogo!!!

<Mutterguy> No barbies this Christmas!
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Wow. That was an awesome way to go out
<Spectrum_Rush> Ninjazz: warm milk
<Cypresswolf> 6_9 I just don't know what went wrong
<Obsidian> what just happened?
<dalekkahn> Ninjazz can you take naps? like 30 minute or so naps?
<d3rb_> naps are awesome
<Ninjazz> GilDash, you've had alot of concerned ponies pushing you to go to bed, before? :S
<LightningDashFast> in ruby pinch we trust one wat
<|Discord|> It is working?
<|Discord|> OMG HOW
<Ninjazz> dalekkahn, I'm not too good at napping as well. :S
<GilDash> Ninjazz: No. I've had a bad enough sleep cycle to almost cripple me before. :(
<RaveBrony> Mayday!! Mayday!!!
<Mr_Bubbles> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
<alexxm> inb4 it orbits the sun
<d3rb_> holy shit!
<RaveBrony> Were going dowwnnn!!!!
<Ninjazz> GilDash, Ah. I can see why you would be concerned. :S
<Mutterguy> Phase4 has build a super unweildy rocketcraft that can't stand up to the rigors of space
<alexxm> well theres your probleam
<dalekkahn> :( if you stay up long enough to get into a good cycle of naps then you don't actually need to have a long period of sleep.
<Obsidian> all dem parachutes
<LightningDashFast> trident nukes
<GilDash> Ninjazz: If I can minimise the mistakes in other people's lives, I've considered mine to be worthwhile. :)
<Klaypex> WIN!
<Om> Ninjazz: GilDash can be very convincing. Specialy when it guilt trips you >.>
<Ninjazz> Om, tell me about it... :S
<GilDash> dalekkahn: THe problem with that is it isn't any use in standard day life.
<Phase4> 00,02this is Sumica's pyramid
<Phase4> 00,02i'ma make it bigger
<Phase4> 00,02and then launch
<Obsidian> Go for it
<Sylandest> Phase4: godspeed, good sir
<GilDash> Om: I don't try to guilt trip. I simply tell it how it is.
<Im_a_Scatmare> lets do this!
<Klaypex> WIN!
<Invi> lol
<LightningDashFast> O.O WTF
<Invi> dat thing there
<Im_a_Scatmare> needs more boosters
<alexxm> but can we make it orbit the sun
<d3rb_> i want this to work so bad
<Ninjazz> GilDash, well... you're doing a fine job, if I do say so myself.
*Spectrum_Rush tackles Invi
<dalekkahn> GilDash: how so? it minimizes the amout of time you have to sleep.
<Om> GilDash: Fiar enough... but there are times...
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Well, I gotta go. I'll keep this stream on mute and hope it doesn't lag me too much. I'll be back for either HUB stream or EMN, whichever comes first.
<GilDash> Ninjazz: That's not my goal, and you know that. :(
<Barbetos> So I leave the stream for like 30 minutes and I come back to this.
<d3rb_> later Kandarihu|BuddyBear
*Invi hugglewubbles Spectrum_Rush
<Om> -_- chat derp. One moment please
<Mr_Bubbles> Fill you middle
<Obsidian> We can make it bigger, faster, stronger. We have the technology.
<Micro_Nick> !pokemon
<ScriptBot> Micro_Nick, you are a 7Zebstrika.
<Spectrum_Rush> Invi: :)... you know whats coming
<Ninjazz> GilDash, I feel guilty. It may not be your intention, but I always feel guilty for those sad faces you keep leaving at the end of your sentences.

<Ninjazz> :3
<Klaypex> Muffins
<GilDash> dalekkahn: For example, I work 9 hours a day. I need 2 hours before that to prepare and 2 hours after to get home. That's 13 hours already gone. With another 7 needed for sleep, that's 20. WHat's the point of having naps in those 4 hours, and how would you have equal gaps in naps when over 12 hours is taken?
<Mutterguy> Phase4, add Fuel tanks as well!
<Invi> Spectrum_Rush :)
<Klaypex> :S
<LightningDashFast> DoVahDaSh
<GilDash> Ninjazz: It's how I feel. That is all. :(
<Mr_Bubbles> oh shit
<alexxm> why does my internet hate me
<Invi> whoa
<diddutz> so you don't want to try to add a new stage to the pyramid Phase4?
<Cypresswolf> Sky rockets in flight! Afternoon Delight!
*Spectrum_Rush Solarnuclearhugglompwubbles Invi :)
<LightningDashFast> fus roh yay
<Phase4> 00,02i dont know how
<d3rb_> :O $%&%^&*!!!!!
<Klaypex> whats the game called?
<d3rb_> kerbal space program
*Invi is evaporated
<Ninjazz> GilDash, and you know how I feel.
<diddutz> Klaypex: Kerbal Space Program
<Klaypex> thanks
<Om> Ninjazz: Tired :D
<LightningDashFast> they will make it to the moon
<Ninjazz> Om, always. Usually very or very very tired.
<alexxm> why does my internet hate me
<Sylandest> hell, now I feel tired
<Klaypex> its free?
<d3rb_> whatas it doing alexxm ?
<Om> Ninjazz: Yeah. When I get tired I get flippant and stupid xD
<Om> Like right now!
<Im_a_Scatmare> the one thing i hate about this game is flying the rocket really high. then "YES look how high it went" then you have to wait till it hits the ground :/
<GilDash> Om: Yes, you do. ;)
<dalekkahn> Gildash: with naps you actually reduce the total amount of time needed for sleep because sleep is more effective in naps. So rather than sleeping for 7 hours in your offtime you instead take a short nap when you get home, say 30 minutes, then throughout the day take small 30 minute naps. What should happen is you end up sleeping close to 5 or 6 hours while still being alert for the whole time you are awake.
<Om> GilDash: I WAS RIGHT!
<d3rb_> Ninjazz: how active are you?
<Vordox[Spriting]> TO THE MOOOOON!
<Ninjazz> d3rb, not so much.
*Invi gives Spectrum_Rush a hugwubble with the power of puppyface pinkie pie

<Saturn> 08,01hey Phase4!

<Sylandest> *morning
<Ninjazz> Hey there, Saturn!
<Obsidian> Ohi Saturn
<pony_7650> hello
<Saturn> 08,01norming Sylandest
<CupcakeWarrior> Hai Saturn
<Cypresswolf> 200 m\s
<d3rb_> dat Saturn
<GilDash> dalekkahn: What about nights out and things? They can easily last another 5 hours. :S
<|Discord|> This game needs more space
<Cypresswolf> 300 m\s
<Saturn> 08,01so i got chatting to a really hot girl today
<Im_a_Scatmare> its drifting
*Spectrum_Rush is diabeetused so hard he became sugar incarnate
<Sylandest> Saturn: ooooh, do tell
<Spectrum_Rush> Invi: ^
<Om> Saturn: Congrats!
<CupcakeWarrior> Saturn: Awesome :O
<Om> Sylandest: You must be jelly
<GilDash> Saturn: Holla! :)
<Ninjazz> Saturn, cheating on Sylandest already?
<Klaypex> Its Game over
<Jewel> Hello
<Sylandest> Om, Ninjazz: we have a very open marriage :) :D
<Jewel> Um... what is this?
<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: go ooooooon
<Saturn> 08,01and it turns out she likes sci-fi, but hasn't read much of it
<Ninjazz> Hello there, Jewel.
<d3rb_> hey Jewel
<Om> Sylandest: I see..
<alexxm> how'd that go Saturn
<Ninjazz> Sylandest, Wow.
<Klaypex> hi Jewel
<GilDash> Sylandest: Sounds like me and Cherry. Minus the marriage bit. :D
<Im_a_Scatmare> sup jewel
<dalekkahn> Gildash: your right, that is the problem with it. If you have a lifestyle that isn't consistant enough for naps at the same time it falls apart.
<Cypresswolf> over 500 m\s
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: besides that, you're married to Saturn too, remember? :$
<Klaypex> Jewel its kerbal space program
<Om> Sylandest: Sounds like me and myself, oh and I. I is a hoot.
<Sylandest> GilDash: hehehe, it kinda is! sorta...:$
<Jewel> Oh. So simulated space ships?
<Ninjazz> Sylandest, Saturn doesn't love me as much as he loves you. :S
<Klaypex> idk
<GilDash> dalekkahn: And that's why I say modern day life isn't compatible with it. If you had a job where time contraints weren't an issue you'd be fine. Otherwise, us office workers have got to make do.
<Klaypex> i think so
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: nonsense! Saturn! Be a dear and give Ninjazz some wubs
<Ascendant> wtf
<Ascendant> !dns tatooine.sw
<alexxm> hey Jewel hows your day been
<ScriptBot> Unable to resolve tatooine.sw
<Jewel> Those people in the corner look scared.
<Ascendant> !dns tatooine.sw
<Saturn> 08,01so we swapped facebook details and i said i'd lend her some Asimov
<CupcakeWarrior> But..I thought you were mine Ninjazz
<Jewel> And just starting alexxm It is only 9am for me
<ScriptBot> Unable to resolve tatooine.sw
<GilDash> Om: You'll have to introduce me to this "I" of yours. ;)
*Saturn 08,01hugs the hell out of Ninjazz
<d3rb_> in a nutshell Jewel yes
*Ninjazz is crushed with love
<Sylandest> Ninjazz: see? Saturn wubs you too :)
<dalekkahn> GilDash: but, you can also replace the smaller naps you would take during the night out with longer naps on both before and after it. It increases the amount of time you have to sleep from the all nap system, but it is still less time than a solid block of sleep.
<d3rb_> chat derped
<GilDash> Saturn, Sylandest, Ninjazz: So, how did you all get married anyway? And who in the hay ordained that? :D
<Om> GilDash: HA! I almost typed somethign REALLY stupid :P

<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, she was into philosophy
<Om> GilDash: That would be me.
<Saturn> 08,01so we started discussing posthumanism
<GilDash> Philosophy drives me crazy. >_<
<CupcakeWarrior> Ninjazz: Actually, now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure we are all married to Saturn :P
<Om> GilDash: I married them.
<Sylandest> GilDash: It just happened one day. One minute, im single, the next, I'm wearing the Changeling Queen crown and am marries to Saturn and Ninjazz. Do with that what you will
<Saturn> 08,01so today was quit cool
<Mutterguy> next phase....

<immapony> gogogog do it
<Evil_Spike> Everyone likes tacos
<Barbetos> StinkomanFan I have the Hub but my reciever is not hooked up for streaming.
<Jewel> Reddhero12: The same reason they don't put on other things of more mature content
<Dark92Enigma> I'm back everypony!
<Memme> Name a ship "Nightmare Moon" and land on the moon, where you stay for a few thousand years.
<Jewel> I don't think they even must on the .mov series by him
<Reddhero12> They put NSFW links
<Phase4> 00,02it bugs out when you restart the flight
<Reddhero12> But not Jappleack? D:

*Bronysith glomps LordCelestia
<LordCelestia> 0,5Pff, fanfics

<Evil_Spike> There are good fanfics
<Jigglysaint> The only good Twilight is the one that sparkles
<Dark92Enigma> Well Excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me LordCelestia, but that's the name of the song (Paul McCartney, remember)
<Evil_Spike> Like Fallout Equestria
<LordCelestia> 0,5No, not at all
<immapony> there are worse fanfics o.o
<Jewel> Memme: was it called Blood is Thicker then Friendship?
<Phase4> 00,02this seems to be working
<immapony> good one
<Jigglysaint> Somebody write a version of cupcakes only set in the Twilight universe
<Evil_Spike> No
<Memme> Jewel: I think it was called "Nocturne"
<Reddhero12> Lol jiggly
<Jewel> Ah ok. Was it any good?
<Jewel> Twilight isn't a universe silly. She is a unicorn, Jigglysaint
<Memme> I LOVE when people make my favourite pony go dead/bad/psycho.

<LordCelestia> 0,5Dont advertise or link them here.
<Jigglysaint> oh

<Barbetos> Nope
<Evil_Spike> We are here for bronystate, not a random streamer
<Barbetos> He is on justin.tv though. Just google Haxmega, you will find him.
<Jigglysaint> but bronystate won't stream hub
<Dark92Enigma> Staaaaaaaaaarrrchaaaaaaaaaaaaseeeeeeerr!! (Not Starscream, right?)
<Obsidian> One is smiling yet the other two are panicking?
<Evil_Spike> Not until Aquabats
<Memme> Obsidian: One is high.
<Jewel> Do the pilots even do anything?
<Memme> Jewel: I think you just need to keep them alive.
<Obsidian> Seems legit
<Jewel> Won't they live as long as you don't explode?
<Evil_Spike> Damn, my copy of Flash just crashed
<Memme> Jewel: I don't know. They might panic.

<Spectrum_Rush> Saturn: lol
<Airpuff> Saturn: i see :)
<Viri> 14lol
<Saturn> 08,01but yeah, we both agree that was a mistake and a half
<Saturn> 08,01and it took years to rebuild the friendship back to its previous level
<Saturn> 08,01before that, she was my very best friend
<Memme> Phase4: Is it supposed to spin around randomly like that?
<Viri> 14according to the law, I can't use a knife for self-defense, even if anyone else has one o.O
<Saturn> 08,01and it's still not quite back to that level... things still get a tiny bit awkward sometimes
<Airpuff> Saturn: so you're good friends again now? :)
<Phase4> 00,02YES!
*Viri looks for pepper spray
<Phase4> 00,02i can transfer into mun orbit
<Vordox[Spriting]> O.o

<Bronysith> Saturn: john d lancie or patrick stewart. who would make a better 12th doctor?
<StinkomanFan> WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE THE AQUABATS ;A;

<Phase4> 00,02Wrek, do you have the hub?
<Memme> Phase4: And..?
<alexxm> Bronysith i'd be happy with eithor as the doctor
<HyperMetalLugia> ewconcealed carry
<Memme> Is there a Hub in Sweden?
<Phase4> 00,02i dont think so
<HyperMetalLugia> they should just hold it in the air and wave it around
<Phase4> 00,02worth a shot
<Memme> I don't think so.
<Wrek> 05nope, i dont live in united styts of murica
<HyperMetalLugia> while their eyes are closed
<HyperMetalLugia> so much safe
<HyperMetalLugia> r
<Memme> : P
<diddutz> and wouldn't it be swedish?
<Vordox[Spriting]> Well...
<Vordox[Spriting]> Someone Phone Sumica then?
<alexxm> Memme we don't get the hub in euorpe
<Vordox[Spriting]> Or Send a SMS
<Saturn> 08,01so basically, the bride thinks in very similar terms to myself:
<Saturn> 08,01"andrews sister is much too young for you. my own sisters can take care of themselves, but i suppose it is traditional for the best man to sleep with a bridesmaid, thus you have a choice of siobhan or matt"
*Spectrum_Rush 'murrica
<Memme> alexxm: Oh. That sucks.
<immapony> i wish i had the hub :<
<Memme> What is this now?
<Sylandest> Saturn: seems legit :D
<Airpuff> Saturn: :D
<immapony> apparently they are gonna release aquabats in the uk o-o
<Bronysith> Saturn: who would be a better doctor. Patrick Stewart or John D Lancie?
<Memme> Anyone know a good program I can use to tune into radon radio stations nearby?
<Obsidian> wat

<Damos> brb and Lol
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: John De Lancie
<Bronysith> Saturn: /)
<immapony> this game looks confusing :O
<StinkomanFan> I have an idea!
<Memme> immapony: Agreed. This is too complicated for my young brain.
<StinkomanFan> Maybe if we say Sumica's name three times he'll come
<Skydroid> o.o
<Saturn> 08,01i love our conversations:
<Phase4> 00,02i'm good for an orbit
<Saturn> 08,01 me: siobhan would have to be very drunk to sleep with me, i think. matt... not so much
<Saturn> 08,01 Victoria: Well then, that's that tradition covered
<Phase4> 00,02wonder if i cant get a landing
<Skydroid> Some little girl kept blurting
<Sylandest> does anypone else find it funny that the astronaut on the far left is having a great time, while the other two are flipping out? lol
<Cypresswolf> :) I got some money to get through the week and Im waking up with pancakes & the last of my sweet tea

<Memme> Phase4: Can you crash into old ships?
<FlareBot5000> this song confuses me.
<Phase4> 00,02Memme, not quit capable of that much percision
<Obsidian> Sylandest: He's has something other than oxygen in his air tank. :P
<Memme> Sylandest: Yea. The one on the left is high.

<Barbetos> This song sounds so familiar... what is it?
<Phase4> 00,02not sure when
<Sumica> 00,10that's gonna be rough
<Cobellanez> Kerbal Space program
<Panda> Ninjazz! How are ya!

<GilDash> Panda: Holla! :)
*GilDash hugs Panda.
<Panda> Ninjazz whats wrong

<Princess_Molestia> Hello everypony.
<Panda> Gildash, why noy?
<Ninjazz> Panda, I have... things on my mind.
<Panda> Not*
<PinkieCupcake> I like ponies
<Ninjazz> Hello, Molestia.
<MegaMoonShine> What is this song? I like it
<Sumica> 00,10wait, nm they fixed it
<Barbetos> Why not just adjust your flight enough to orbit normally and then slowly go in? Easier landing right?
<Panda> Ninjazz, may i queery you about it? :(
<Sumica> 00,10not sure how altimiter works off the moon but ok
<GilDash> Panda: Let's not even start. :D
<sonicrainboomer259> why does the theme for the first portal fit this song?!hmmmmmmmmm.........Oh yeah!!!SPAAAAAAACEEEEEEEE
<GarrettBrony> is Kerbal space program Indie?
<Panda> Gildash :(
<Princess_Molestia> Hello Gildash.
<Sumica> 00,10lose that mass
<Ninjazz> Panda, it's nothing I'd like to discuss or can even begin to.
<Cobellanez> The first portal game didn't involve space
<GilDash> Princess_Molestia: Oh! Hiya... :$
<Phase4> 00,02when its out of fuel
<CAVEMEN> ???
<PinkieCupcake> princess molestia?! ....
<Sumica> 00,10then use the fuel
<Sumica> 00,10that mass is gonna speed you back up
<Rain> ^
<Rain> do a burn out and drop it
<sonicrainboomer259> Princess_Molestia: Hey,ummmm,PLEASE DONT MOLEST ME!!!!!
<dalekkahn> acceleration is the same no matter what the mass.

<Obsidian> bbl guy. I gotta go work with my family, but I should be back in time for the Euro Night. Later everypony.
<Deadlypon3> Kerbals are silliest space programs :p
<derpy_pony> bye Obsidian
<Dark_Horst> Phase4: well, you coudl land them. carefully
<Sumica> 00,10and my shot at the moon was messed up by the altimiter not being set to the mun

<Rain> he sped up
<Phase4> 00,02i assume its a feature of .15
<Phase4> 00,02only reason i could hit the moon
<herpy-derpy> HEY
<supersora10> XD
<Sumica> 00,10only time I saw somthing like that was when i was on a solar collision path
<diddutz> gravity suprises me everytime, when it's just fucking low for a moon orbit O.o

<Sumica> 00,10did't expect to have an aproch speed of 250 km/s
*diddutz does some research on gravity
<PinkieCupcake> I saw her in a past episode
<Rain> XD
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Just found this: http://imgur.com/vchNI

<icybeauti> Hi I'm back
<Sumica> 00,10good thing i did't put the updated chute on that one
<Barbetos> That thing is gona fall forever
<Rain> why Sumica?
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, why?
<Sumica> 00,10nah that type of chute is a drag chute
<Rain> and it would take forever to land?
<supersora10> Anyone seen some good movies?
<icybeauti> FOOOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEEEVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRR
<Phase4> 00,02that other one
<Phase4> 00,02that exploded on the moon
<Sumica> 00,10the updated fully opens at what ever altitude you deply at
<Phase4> 00,02might actualy be able to make it back
<icybeauti> supersora10: Did you see madagasgar yet?
<Phase4> 00,02need very little force to escape mun and transfer orbit
<Rain> but it has no thrust at all
<herpy-derpy> oh wow
<Sumica> 00,10also you dont have the updated chute so that would meen you would have no chute on this
<PinkieCupcake> Incoming parachute
<dalekkahn> We have touchdown :D. Horray

<WindWhistler> Man, I wanna play this game, but the demo's boring...
<Barbetos> For now, imagination.
<icybeauti> Da heck iz diz?
<Phase4> 00,02the one on stream now is the one that crashed into the moon
<herpy-derpy> IDK
<dalekkahn> Sumica: you almost had that failed plane become a boat several times
<PinkieCupcake> just hope
<Cypresswolf> :D no water rescue
*WindWhistler is bored
<Crono_brony> what is the name of this remix?
<Sumica> 00,10what do you meen almost?

<drf-Droid> hm
<dalekkahn> Sumica: there was a new episode 1 hour ago
<Sumica> 00,10yeah you are alive on luna
<drf-Droid> I think Advanced Task Killer is breaking this
<icybeauti> I saw the first like 3 episodes, then forgot about, then started watching it again.
<Phase4> 00,02yep
<SpeedyBolt> I watched the first episode and I loved it
<Phase4> 00,02trapped forever
<Phase4> 00,02with luna
<SpeedyBolt> For some reason I havent seen the rest
<icybeauti> -ponkie pie forever-
<Sumica> 00,10I could be ok with that
<PinkieCupcake> Yeah the first episode was epic
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> Well, it's a continuing story. It was planned from the beginning to last this long. More episodes are going to require more planning.
<Phase4> 00,02i've got the transfers figured for mun
<icybeauti> They decided to rescue nickalodeon tepurarily.
<Phase4> 00,02so tomorow i might be able to attempt both landing And takeoff from the moon
<alexxm> so is the stream down
<Phase4> 00,02mun';
<Spectrum_Rush> Phase4: http://fim.413chan.net/fic/src/130221079136-Luna_happy.jpg
<Wrek> 05you still streaming Phase4?
<Phase4> 00,02nope
<Sumica> 00,10oh there is a new korra today
<Phase4> 00,02was on stream WAY too long today
<icybeauti> Sumica: It ended a long time ago
<Sumica> 00,10guess I have to stream it after movie night
<dalekkahn> Sumica: yes, it ended a half hour ago. And the finale is next week
<Vordox[Spriting]> Phase4: One hour Terraria, 3 hours TF2, 7 hours of Space Program. XD
<Red_Pegasus> Prepare you're selves... Wrek is going to stream.
<Wrek> 05Sumica: nah i got the post show covered
<Sumica> 00,10time zones are like magnets, no one here knows how they work.
<icybeauti> WOOP WOOP
<Wrek> 05gotta draw
<PinkieCupcake> Aww man that means I missed the new episode!
<Phase4> 00,02this is what happens whenever no-one else is awake
<ponibas> time zones are dumb
<Sumica> 00,10that's fine wrek
<Phase4> 00,02Spectrum_Rush, :)
<Vordox[Spriting]> Phase4: XD We'll NOT Criticize you...openly :P
<Sumica> 00,10you have to sleep some time
<Sumica> 00,10and you got a 9 hour head start on me.
<icybeauti> Oh you're drawing? Imma txt my friend bout that.
<ponibas> I kind liked the one idea that had everyone going by UTC and just having things open during daylight(ish) hours
<PinkieCupcake> Is anyone else livestream is loading so long?
<ponibas> so 1700 was 1700 everyplace
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> This is the problem with western animation. Sure the production values are higher, but everything lasts for no more than half a year of new episodes at a time, leading to inevitable reruns.
<herpy-derpy> Yes mine
<icybeauti> But if it closes when the US is at night, the australians and asians won't have anything to watch.
<SpeedyBolt> Mine too
<Red_Pegasus> The stream ended.
<Phase4> 00,02minmus will be a chalenge
<Phase4> 00,02a lot further away than mus, return trip will be dificult
<Kandarihu|BuddyBear> I was liking that Flying Derpy song that was going on before the stream cut out
<Sumica> 00,10the trick Phase4 is to warp while still on the pad
<SpeedyBolt> Well I got nothin to do before I go to a friends house
<SpeedyBolt> We're eating cake :p
<Phase4> 00,02Sumica, yeah, but i dont know When to take off
<Sumica> 00,10wait for a good shot at it from the ground
<herpy-derpy> what time is it in the US
<SpeedyBolt> (To be honest, I wouldve preferred Blueberry muffins)
<herpy-derpy> ?
<PinkieCupcake> Chocolate cake?
<Panda> Wrek, sorry that pic is taking a while... my comp is derping xD
<SpeedyBolt> Over here it's 11:06
<ponibas> 9:07am Pacific
<icybeauti> My fam is hosting a BBQ today...I guess I'll spend most of the time grabbing food and being here
<SpeedyBolt> AM
<Sumica> 00,10there is an orbital caculator for the game

<Drawer> :3
<Spectrum_Rush> alexxm: In the original comicbook continuity, Dr Curt Connors became The Lizard whilst attempting to regenerate his missing arm. In the trilogy of films directed by Sam Raimi, he was a recurring character but did not transform, although it is rumoured Raimi wanted to introduce The Lizard in Spider-Man 4 but faced studio resistance. Ironically, The Lizard will finally appear in The Amazing Spider-Man, the reboot.
<Spectrum_Rush> oh crap
