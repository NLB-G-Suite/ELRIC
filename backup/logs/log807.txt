<DiscSlash> is a music vid?
<Dark_Horst> and this children, is called acapella metal
<conami> is a cult!
<brony655321> OOH who dat lady?
<Vordox> Van Canto (sometimes stylized as van Canto) is a German a cappella metal band, founded in 2006 and composed of five singers and a drummer. Although the group is often classified as an a cappella ensemble, they use real drums in their music, instead of vocal percussion or beatboxing.
<Rattletrap> hmm
<Dark_Horst> well, this one not som metal
<Chrysalis> This is Van Canto - last night of the kings
<BlitzMcKrieg> a cappella, that means with dubstep, right?
<Vordox> Van Canto play a cappella with classic heavy, power and symphonic metal influence, creating what they call "hero metal a capella".
<pony_1057h> Wonderbolt Academy is on youtube

<Wrek> 05I like everyoen Dr. Reed.
<alexxm> i'm good DitzyDerp15 do you know who won the lottery?
<moonslicer> i love learning about new rock bands im a rock and roll kid
<Chrysalis> all cool bands have singers with aviators
<DitzyDerpy15> im excited about new epiode im playing Roblox MLP: FiM Roleplay lolol

<PrincessDerpestia> yoyoyo
<moonslicer> did you know motar head is the loudest band in the world?
<weylin|Blarg> those awesome bands~
<moonslicer> when i say by loud
<Ralathon> Yea Avantasia and Ayreon always invite shitloads of other metal players for their albums.
<brony655321> Wow...that's actually an impressive list.
<moonslicer> i mean so loud your ears bleed and you cant hear for days lol
<CTHULHU> what about korpiklaani?
<Dark_Horst> project band?
<brony655321> Actually, I thought Man O War held the record for loudest...
<moonslicer> no it is motar head
<Dark_Horst> didnt they call that metallica once?
<Wrek> 05this is classed as symphonic power metal
<moonslicer> it could be heard for 6 miles in the 9090s
<Wrek> 05and IIII LOVE IT
<PrincessDerpestia> Will we be playing any Turbonegro?
<weylin|Blarg> symphonic metal is <3
<Dark_Horst> best metal
<brony655321> Metal is metal in my eyes...these demi-genres need to get over themselves.
<moonslicer> will there be a metallica song like master of puppet?
<PrincessDerpestia> sooooo
<PrincessDerpestia> yes?
<Wrek> 05brony655321: powermetal is so different from say dethcore metal
<CTHULHU> play some blind guardian next
<Ralathon> I'm pretty sure it goes to the Sovjet military. A 50MT nuclear warhead on pointblank range is probably the loudest manmade sound ever made.
<Wrek> 05its pretty much needed to have the sub genres
<Dark_Horst> saying metal is metal is pretty damn stupid
<weylin|Blarg> Symphonic from plain Heavy
<Wrek> 05best song
<Sharkun0> Play some Avenged Sevenfold next
<Wrek> 05is this one
<brony655321> Yeah I know. But still...it's ridiculous how many there are for any musical genre.
<Dark_Horst> you cant simply put two completely different styles of music in the smae genre
<moonslicer> i know two rock bands
<moonslicer> metallica and motarhead
<moonslicer> and i love there albums
<weylin|Blarg> Music is too huge to just have specific main genres
<PrincessDerpestia> Play I Got A Knife by Turbonegro. It has deep lyrics
<brony655321> moonslicer: Motorhead by the way.
<Ralathon> Its the same way that both humans and snails are mammalia yet are completely different.
<moonslicer> sorry lol
<Sharkun0> Snails aren't mammals though...
<brony655321> moonslicer: it's cool. They are awesome.
<moonslicer> everything is connected in ways we couldnt imagian ralathon
<moonslicer> what!? a add!?
<CTHULHU> the singer dresses like bret michaels
<moonslicer> oh well its gone
<Sharkun0> Lol, I don't get ads
<Wrek> 05look into adblock
<Ralathon> Eurgh I meant animals ofcourse. Early hour is doing my head in.
<weylin|Blarg> There is no shame in adblock
<moonslicer> i get them on every single of my fav videos

<Ninjazz> Wrek, typical entitled dude that doesn't know that a browser can have multiple tabs open.
<Dark_Horst> if you're german, and dare show a hint of patriotism, everybody suddenly sees a nazi

<BlitzMcKrieg> japan is like that too
<Sharkun0> Very silly
<weylin|Blarg> If my mustache and beard colors were switched, I could potentially grow the flag of Germany on my face ._. huge joke in my circle of friends
<brony655321> That is true...first thing we thing of considering Germans is Nazi. Then food.
<brony655321> Brats and whatnot.

<Phase4> DSNesmith, are you not watching?
<EspyLacopa> fluttercry: Because it was blatantly obvious that it -was- going there.
<cachi01> http://static.tumblr.com/gdvenyy/WPrm200zv/arnbo_dish_clear.png wundahbelts pls
<Lasharus> Really, adding that kind of character drama wouldn't work for a series like this at ALL.
<Ninjazz> Solid 9/10. Was good.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> I loved it.
<AttackWithHugs> I give it an 8/10
<Kawaii_icybeauti> everyone is abandoning ship.
<fluttercry> 05,15But why did it HAVE to go there? It would have been interesting to see how they would have handled her leaving the wonderbolts dream and learning that sometimes you have to give up a dream
<DSNesmith> k I have to go find spitfire/LD pi- STUDY FOR FINALS
<XAX> yeah, i'm not in the mood to listen to people spilling their spaghetti all over andrea libman.
<DSNesmith> lots of studying
<MadSurge> Boooo/10
<EspyLacopa> Everyone leaving? They don't want to listen to Andrea Libman?
<XAX> night all.
<Lasharus> Eh, never mind, I'm not going to discuss fan interpretations of the new episode. I'll just enjoy it on its own merits. :P
<RaveBrony> 8/10 before Rarity hugging.... 5/10 after
<Phase4> sometimes on internet
<Quorl> All that __x__ has quit on main chat
<RaveBrony> Damn it, Hasbro =_(\

<DSNesmith> I really don't want to study quantum mechanics
<XAX> OH NO RARITY HUGGED THUNDERLANE AFTER HE SAVED HER LIFE FUCKING HASBRO ENCOURAGING SHIPPING OH MY GOOOOOOOOD.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Man, she made brawl taunts and nin10doh,my childhood.
<RaveBrony> Ninjazz: I took it as cute, I mean come on. He did save her. But this fandom and the sickness that plagues a big deal of it :[
<MadSurge> Kawaii_icybeauti: how weird eh? :D
<fluttercry> 05,15Soooo. Does RD stay at the academy for future episodes now?
<Kammerjunk> DSNesmith: I wish my teacher knew anything about the subject.
<naturesfury> fluttercry: dont think any1 knows
<Kawaii_icybeauti> oh, is this the pissed panda episode?
<XAX> fluttercry: no title or synopsis has been released for episode 8, so who knows.
<MadSurge> fluttercry: if it means we'll never see her again, I'm all for it!
<String_Shredder> Mom's spaghetti
<DSNesmith> maybe ep 8 is where twilight goes godmode finally

<Ninjazz> RaveBrony, see man. That's not a good way to deal with things. Look at me, I nearly popped a fuse when Trixie was on screen but that was CANON. This time it was just a hug for saving someone's life. Nothing OBVIOUS about that.
<valoreins|Drawing> wait, people got mad because rarity hugged thunderlane?
<valoreins|Drawing> i missed something lol
<otakon> valoreins|Drawing: not mad, worried about the possible shipping
<otakon> OH GOD THE SHIPPING
<XAX> correction. there was a synopsis released for episode 8. muh derp.
<otakon> FEDEX IS COMING!
<valoreins|Drawing> nah, it's the nature of shipping
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Everyone is just going to take that hug the wrong way. Instead of a thnk you hug it becomes a shipping hug -.-

<DSNesmith> tons of.... stuff
<twilight_sprinkle> so theyre not taking questions anymore?
<ScootaChicken> thelonepony: YOU CAN'T IGNORE HIS GIRTH.
<thelonepony> naw
<twilight_sprinkle> crap
<thelonepony> ScootaChicken: I wont ;)
<DSNesmith> it was leaked?
<fluttercry> 05,15and then everything got awkward again
<RaveBrony> This Aquabats ia actually pretty funny if you hear it :D
<Rose`> i liek it :3
<Rose`> awkward is cute, just look at SuperBrony64
<prince-dari> Ahahaha, I didn't think anyone was actually going to ask the Gary's girth question
<prince-dari> This is brilliant
<Kammerjunk> It is.
<Ninjazz> See the problem is that they keep going to the fandom talk.
<ScootaChicken> prince-dari: It didn't get answered though.
<prince-dari> Lawl
<Ninjazz> IT GOT IGNORED.
<fluttercry> 05,15If awkward is cute then I'm the cutest person in the world. Eye contact? lol what's that
<DSNesmith> >visual novels
<DSNesmith> >games
<Rose`> female?
<Rose`> mousy?
<prince-dari> Should have sent her a link to the origin picture
<Rose`> glasses?
<Rose`> fluttercry?
<StinkomanFan> Is... that Rhette and Link?
<ScootaChicken> Ermagerd, they keep talking about shit none of us care about instead of actually answering the questions.
<MadSurge> Choose your own adventure! çD
<fluttercry> 05,15I think that is StinkomanFan
<MadSurge> :D
<fluttercry> 05,15no no it's not
<fluttercry> 05,15they just look a lot like them
<DSNesmith> if awkward is cute then this "interview" is cuter than sweetie belle's voice cracking
<ScootaChicken> flutterspaghetti.
<prince-dari> It's still going on?
<RaveBrony> Wuuut
<RaveBrony> All the way over there??
<RaveBrony> D:
<DSNesmith> conventions
<DSNesmith> why
<twilight_sprinkle> are they going to take anymore questions?
<fluttercry> 05,15One time I lost a bet, and I had to either stand in a fountain in a busy street, or talk to a girl
<RaveBrony> I dont think so
<fluttercry> 05,15I chose the fountain
<Ninjazz> Nope. Time to for shameless pluuuuuugs.
<Ninjazz> Up the damn butt.
<twilight_sprinkle> crap
<Rose`> fluttercry, youre very cute to me right now
<RaveBrony> fluttercry: What?? :D
<prince-dari> LOL
<Rose`> we should get to know each other better, hai, i go by rose~
<RaveBrony> O_o
<ScootaChicken> LEL.
<prince-dari> You should have done both
<fluttercry> 05,15but....that's hard
<prince-dari> Got a girl to come join you in the fountain
<ScootaChicken> ^
<Rose`> i would talk to someone standing in a fountain
<fluttercry> 05,15DAMMIT WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT
<Rose`> theyre interesting :3
<prince-dari> ^
<prince-dari> That will never fail to work
<DSNesmith> "you have a beard and you're kinda fat"
<DSNesmith> bronies, ladies and gents
<StinkomanFan> OK :c
<Ninjazz> No. This is not bronies. This is spaghetti.
<fluttercry> 05,15beard, but all of it is located in the neck area
<Ninjazz> Spaghetti has been in the wild before brony neck beards.
<MadSurge> DSNesmith: I can't grow a beard and I swim :( I'm not a true brony
<cachi01> nothing better than goofing around with a toy lightsaber
<RaveBrony> Hahahaha
<fluttercry> 05,15This should probably wrap up soon
<StinkomanFan> :o
<Ninjazz> We can so see what's going on.
<ScootaChicken> Ninjazz: The brony fandom has caused the largest influx of Italian food the world has ever seen.
<Ninjazz> We are so entertained.
<DSNesmith> they're just talking about random shit
<ScootaChicken> Bronycon is more or less just a great big ragu factory.
<Kammerjunk> I don't know, I kinda like italian food.
<Kammerjunk> Especially the deserts.
<Ninjazz> And enough tomato sauce to drown all of the East Coast, ScootaChicken.
<Phase4> sleep time
<naturesfury> night Phase4
<DSNesmith> night
<ScootaChicken> I really want to go to Bronycon next year just to see exactly how awkward it is.
<StinkomanFan> Animaniacs Marathon! :o
<DSNesmith> ScootaChicken: not worth it
<ScootaChicken> I also wanna go so I can ship Saxy x Twilight NASA 4 life.
<ScootaChicken> DSNesmith: tbh the only reason I really wanna go is so I can meet various American bronystate people :P
<DSNesmith> NASA? wut
<DSNesmith> wow
<DSNesmith> wooooow
<RaveBrony> O_o
<DSNesmith> and I thought Phoe using pony vocabulary in the Jason interview was as awkward as fan/creator interaction could get
<DSNesmith> glad to see I was wrong
<Ninjazz> You know. I'm torn.
<fluttercry> 05,15We can carry tomato sauce and bowls of spaghetti and give them to random people
<Kammerjunk> I guess it's just because Denmark is so small, but every time I've been at a meetup, we just did a marathon and ate McDonalds. No singing, no raiding Toys'R'Us, just watching ponies in a rented room.
<Kammerjunk> Oh, and D&D.
*MadSurge still doesn't get the spaghetti thing
<DSNesmith> this lady's voice
<DSNesmith> she's best pony and has dat voice
<Deathscar|Normandy> I think I broke Anneli
<MadSurge> Applepiiiieeeee
<Deathscar|Normandy> Anneli: If you wanan do cons, then come to Singapore! We have.... n-no conventions... but we do have a community! :D
<fluttercry> 05,15hug from Swedish Spitfire?
<fluttercry> 05,15k
<Obsidian> Yes! Do that!
<DSNesmith> she's not afraid to get her hands dirty
<Vinyl9291> i want to hug her <3
<DSNesmith> seriously wuvs for spitfire in any language
<wowviewer> Come to Universal Studios Hollywood then. I work there now :P
<Snow> dont come to the netherlands we dont have anything and the weather sucks
<StinkomanFan> "Soarin's Applepiiiiiie~" ...If you excuse me I have to go change my pants... :$
<Snow> D:
<CountDoofus> Disneyland, Sea World, Universal Studios... USA has the best theme parks :(
<Ninjazz> I live away from all of the US. I have little to no pasta around me. I know this is a blessing in disguise but I kinda want to see just much alfredo sauce can be made from a brony meat up.
<BroPony|MEDIC> Question to all: How much pony stuff do you own?
<Obsidian> East coast FTW
<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo: Question for Anneli/Rina-Chan/Andrea: "When you are voice acting, do you like playing around in your inner child to make it come out in the voice?"
<wowviewer> lol
<ScootaChicken> fluttercry: >give them
<DSNesmith> was "meat up" a pun
<ScootaChicken> Lawl, I'm gonna throw it at them whether they like it or not.
