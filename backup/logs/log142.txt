<LunaTheForgotten> Thanks Luna's bf
<Luna> 07,1he suggested to stream it
<Zephirdd> Hey luckiest-guy-in-the-world, if you're reading this, thx! =d
<LunaTheForgotten> WE LOVE IT HERE!!!!
<LunaTheForgotten> lol
<Luna> 07,1lol he's laughing
<Diftraku> Oh lol
<Diftraku> http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/molestia
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, I guess he's reading this so thanks!
<Diftraku> It actually is a word
<Luna> 07,1he is, yes
<GrimGallop> Afk
*Veewave loves it here
<Rainbow-Dash> I feel like Minecraft now.
<Luna> 07,1you should watch the stream >.>
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So "molestia" is latin for annoyance or trouble, I guess...
*LunaTheForgotten agrees with Veewave.
<Diftraku> EE-yup
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, that does fit!
<CriticKitten> xD
<Rainbow-Dash> I should watch the stream?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15She is like a constant source of trouble
<Apokalipse> This is so great
<Luna> 07,1lol Walter is epic
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You should, if you like Jeff Dunham, Rainbow-Dash
<Zephirdd> lol poor kid
<Luna> 07,1and if you don't you should still watch
<Luna> 07,1cause it's awesome
<RobotPinkie> 06,15or if you have no idea who it is, you should watch :P
<Rainbow-Dash> It is pretty awesome.. But I have stuff to do D:
<CriticKitten> Bwahaha
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Basically, you should watch the stream, is the point. :P
<CriticKitten> Love this part.
<Veewave> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Can you explode twice?
<Zephirdd> By the way, Luna, do you have any numbers on people connected(rather than people on chat)?
<Rainbow-Dash> Maybe if you concentrate hard enough RobotPinkie
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol
*Veewave can explode twice
<Zephirdd> For example, we hit over 1500 bronies yesterday, but those were only on chat
<Zephirdd> probably at least 3000 on stream
<Luna> 07,1yea. we are getting bigger :)
<LunaTheForgotten> I thought about something the other day.
<Luna> 07,1but still need more bronies!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, pretty much. A whole lot of people.
<LordCelestia> Oh I love Jeff Dunham so much
<Diftraku> Luna, I take it you are not using Google Analytics or something like that to keep count?
<Apokalipse> ahaha lol
<LunaTheForgotten> What if we streamed Pinkie Quest, when we had over a thousand bronies.
<Zephirdd> woudl be nice if the stream plugin showed the number of conections imo
<Diftraku> Zephirdd: You can actually...
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Then the internet would spontaneously combust, LunaTheForgotten
<Luna> 07,1nope, not at this point
<Apokalipse> lol april fools
<Diftraku> Not directly from the embed
<LordCelestia> @LunaTheForgotten They would probably enjoy that.
<Luna> 07,1we just want to be known in thebrony community
<Diftraku> Luna: You might want to look into setting it up at somepoint
<LunaTheForgotten> Yeah I guess That would happen RobotPinkie
<Diftraku> Stats are always nice :3
<Zephirdd> Oh, but you are! :O
<Apokalipse> You are very well known
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Seems likely anyway :P
<LordCelestia> I'd be happy to advertise on my DeviantArt, if you want.
<Luna> 07,1sure, your free to do what-ever you want :) it's your DA after-all
<LordCelestia> As in not spamming people but post a nice image of something about BronyState
<CriticKitten> Have been trying to convince people to join myself. :P
<LordCelestia> :)
<Zephirdd> lmao this is too goodf
<LunaTheForgotten> This is sooooo epic.
<LordCelestia> Oh my god, I love this puppet (I forget his name, someone help me out)
<CriticKitten> Walter
<LunaTheForgotten> Walter
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha :D
<LordCelestia> Ah, I remember now
<CriticKitten> He's probably my favorite or second favorite.
<Zephirdd> Ackhmed is awesome too
<Apokalipse> LOL
*LordCelestia is laughing his head off
<Veewave> suicide-chicken
<Zephirdd> Wait

<CriticKitten> Yeah, Ackmed's great too. xD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Wow, I'm far behind
<Veewave> I'm about 5 seconds behind.
<CriticKitten> xD
<Zephirdd> I'm faaaar behind
<LunaTheForgotten> I'm about a minute behind.
<LordCelestia> :o
<RobotPinkie> 06,15maybe 10 seconds behind, lawl

<Diftraku> Well, you can have VLC capture your current screen and rebroadcast it
<DashWithRainbows> 1.8 made it lag for me
<Revolver> because of the multiple streams?
<FlaschenJoe11> Discord
<DashWithRainbows> thats one reason why people stopped playing as it fucks up minecrafts fps
<Randall1160> I should put up my Server and everyone should join
<FlaschenJoe11> that's reason enough
<Randall1160> Minecrat Server
<GrimGallop> Well, it doesn't help that he's three streams deep into streamception.
*FlaschenJoe11 gives standing ovation(sp?)!

<Diftraku> Ponies are naked all the time
<DashWithRainbows> never heard of those 2 words used in the same sentence before!?
<Revolver> It would be odder to see them wearing clothes IMO
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Autorigging doesn't work very well in Blender
*FlaschenJoe11 is sad
<Revolver> it works fairly well in 3Ds max for me
<CriticKitten> Ha, that's like the only one I have memorized
*Veewave is cupcakes
<Revolver> not sure about Maya though
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Also you still have to fiddle with constraints quite a bit.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that's cause 3ds Max > All :P
<Revolver> or Cinema 4D
<Revolver> which I JUST GOT!
<Randall1160> GMAX lol I used that way back in the day

<ValtheJean> 2,14 but who knows? Perhaps this is just revenge for the incessant Caramel trolling everyone seems to take so much pleasure in
<RobotPinkie> 06,15No, I'm saying you're entitled to prefer whatever you prefer, not saying you're entitled to think everyone else is wrong for disagreeing, Val. Big difference.

<EspyLacopa> Bruce Campbell as a pony?
<CriticKitten> Herd Notice?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I liek presents
<EspyLacopa> Sumica: When are you going to do the next two Star Driver episodes?
*Natleyn hugs NewDCD
<Natleyn> Stop making me love you D:
<Lagmobile> Magneto is best pony
<NewDCD> 9 also my estimated arrival time for my Shin Ichigo Figuarts is September 30..in USA...and then I got to wait for the Miami-to-Panama shipping
<NewDCD> AMAZON GO FASTER PLEASE ;___;
<EspyLacopa> Magnanimous is awesome pony.
<Sumica> probly not till next weekend, have swing shift all this week.
<NewDCD> 9 inb4 Skyrider I AM AMAZAWN
<EspyLacopa> Fair enough.
<NewDCD> 9 also sup Nat
<Natleyn> Hiya DCD :3
*Fluttershy` glomps NewDCD
<ValtheJean> 2,14 out of curiosity, is Star Driver in any of the SRW's?
<EspyLacopa> ValtheJean: No.
<Sumica> too new
<NewDCD> 9 Val: Star Driver is 2010
<NewDCD> 9 most people quote a 3-year rule for SRW
<NewDCD> 9 but in truth it isn't so
<ValtheJean> 2,14 "convert the driver's libido into energy" what the fuck?
<NewDCD> 9 in the end they just fit new series to any SRW that can fit it
<EspyLacopa> There's also the licensing issues.
<NewDCD> 9 enough time after the series have aired so it doesn't spoil so bad
<FlaschenJoe11> DCD IS BACK BEEEYAAATCH!
<NewDCD> 9 not to mention the fact that games like SRW take a hefty amount of time to develop
<NewDCD> 9 technically I should be working on my Les Mis project...been procrastinating all day, due tomorrow with a speech as well...and gotta study biostatistics to boot
<NewDCD> 9 but meh
<EspyLacopa> Star Driver might not get into a SRW game until what, 2014 or so?
<NewDCD> 9 I'm just not into my game
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<NewDCD> 9 Espy: I could predict it being as soon as late 2012
<NewDCD> 9 but so far they haven't even announced Z2-2 and I doubt they'll add new series in Z2-2
<NewDCD> 9 the roster is already jam-packed enough. They'll just give us awesome unit upgrades
<ValtheJean> 2,14 like more veritechs? :D
<NewDCD> 9>inb4 Star Driver actually makes it to Z2-2 and we get TENGEN TOPPA TAUBURN
<EspyLacopa> I'm still waiting for them to add Megas.
<Natleyn> ^Oh lord.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I think the SDF-1 should come back, because I want it in with Dai-Guard and Big-O :P
*Fluttershy` 8has lost track of the conversation.
<NewDCD> 9 It won't be in this game. It's impossiburu
<Veewave> ^
<Sumica> But the SDF1 is part of a city now
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah I know :P
<NewDCD> 9 We talking about giant robots yaw
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but it deserves more than just the GBA game :P
<NewDCD> 9 It'd be cool if we got Macross 7
*DashWithRainbows has done the same, all he see's in chat is green and grey highlight...
<NewDCD> 9 If just for FUCKING MAX JENIUS: PERFECT PARENT
<Sumica> hell you might as well ask for the Big Road
*ValtheJean really should download that ROM, just for having the Skull Squad
<ValtheJean> 2,14 or was it wolf?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I can't remember
<Lagmobile> what are we talking about? Whats SWR?
<EspyLacopa> Super Robot Wars.
<NewDCD> 9 SRW= Super Robot Wars
<ValtheJean> 2,14 SRW is Super Robot Wars
<ctrlx> star wars republic?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 basically, an RPG with every giant robot anime
<Lagmobile> so ive heard
<Lagmobile> never actuall played it...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 just watch when DCD streams it sometime :P
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you wont regret it
<Apokalipse> an RPG with every giant robot anime? This is relevant to my interests
<Lagmobile> So what is it the SSB of giant robots?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 tis awesome apokalipse
<NewDCD> 9Lagmobile: pretty much
<ctrlx> does it have gundam 08th ms team?
<NewDCD> 9 DAMMIT ARRIVE ALREADY ;___; http://www.amazon.com/Bandai-Kamen-Rider-Shin-Ichigo/dp/B004UPIOMC/ref=pd_sbs_t3
<Kencolt> hi?
<Lagmobile> yo
<NewDCD> 9ctrlx: AFAIK the only one with 08th MS is A Portable. Which I own.
<ctrlx> long japanese name
<Sumica> Hi Kencolt
<EspyLacopa> It looked more like a turn based strategy game.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's a turn based RPG
<NewDCD> 9 I was debating whether streaming A Portable or MX after Z2
<NewDCD> 9 since we're really close to endgame
<ValtheJean> 2,14 not sure what any of those other than Z2 are :P
<Lagmobile> What systems again? Might find some roms...
<EspyLacopa> Does the endgame have Anti-Spirals?
<NewDCD> 9 but guess what
<NewDCD> 9 you get to choose
<NewDCD> 9 Espy: this is Z2-1. It will end with the LordGenome battle for the GL-plot
<NewDCD> 9 and will wrap up Geass S1 and Gundam 00 S1
<NewDCD> 9 basically all series which can be divided in parts will have half the plot done by the endgame
<NewDCD> 9 No news yet on the release dates for Saisei-hen though
<Lagmobile> 7 years of bad spy luck...
<NewDCD> 9Also you guys get to choose the next SRW:
<NewDCD> http://www.giantbomb.com/super-robot-wars-mx/61-22584/
<NewDCD> http://www.giantbomb.com/super-robot-wars-a-portable/61-22178/
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I vote the GBA one with SDF-1 :P
<NewDCD> 9There is no GBA one with that
<NewDCD> oh yeah Alpha Gaiden is an option too
<NewDCD> a sec
<Natleyn> I'm picking MX at random.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 wait...I thought there was...
*Fluttershy` gives up, lays down on the ground, and puts a paper bag over her head. "So long and thanks for all the fish...."
<Diftraku> http://imgur.com/gallery/Jw2Oc
<NewDCD> 9http://www.giantbomb.com/super-robot-wars-alpha-gaiden/61-22662/ choice number 3. This is the only one that has english.
<MrChang> hey fluttershy
*Veewave turns int a tree
<MrChang> what did you think of the session yesterday?
<Veewave> *into
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I VOTE ALPHA GAIDEN
<Natleyn> OH god the session
<Natleyn> So much alcohol.
<Lagmobile> g2g guys
<Lagmobile> c ya later
<Natleyn> Bye Lagmobile!
*Natleyn hugs Lagmobile
<NewDCD> 9 One vote for Alpha Gaiden
<NewDCD> 9I was gravitating for MX though, because EVA units would draw a lot of people to SRW
<Veewave> bye Lagmobile
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, then go with that if you want :P
<Veewave> ^
<NewDCD> 9 I'm putting it for votin'
<NewDCD> 9 BUT ONLY VAL SEEMS TO VOTE
<Sumica> eva sounds good
*Veewave votes for eva
<FlaschenJoe11> MX!
<Sumica> I realy dont know one from another
<FlaschenJoe11> Is it true if you level Unit-01 right he can hold off half the enemy fleet in endgame?
<NewDCD> 9 Also there's a reason I don't want to stream a full playthrough for Alpha Gaiden
<Natleyn> I vote MX :<
<NewDCD> 9 It's the only one in English
<NewDCD> 9 I'd like people to go play it themselves
<NewDCD> 9It's a great way to get familiarized with SRW
<ValtheJean> 2,14 :P
<NewDCD> 9I might sample a few stages but that's it
<FlaschenJoe11> TROMBE~!
<MeteorVenture> well take care guys i guess i'm going to sleep
<NewDCD> 9MAYBE IF I POST THIS LINK ENOUGH TIMES IT WILL GET HERE SOONER ;__________; http://www.amazon.com/Bandai-Kamen-Rider-Shin-Ichigo/dp/B004UPIOMC/ref=pd_sbs_t3
<FlaschenJoe11> RIDER KICK!
<Sumica> you get mail on sundays?
<FlaschenJoe11> How are the votes right now DCD?
<MeteorVenture> not that i was really paying attention anyway lol.. but hey.. anyway goodnight:D
<FlaschenJoe11> Nite Meteor
<NewDCD> 9 i DON'T GET MAIL
*Natleyn hugs MeteorVenture
<Natleyn> Sleep well~
<NewDCD> 9 and I guess MX it is
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hardest part of Splinter Cell: Done. All in a day's work.
<FlaschenJoe11> yay~!
<MeteorVenture> brohoof's all around!
<Natleyn> Yay, my vote wins~
<Veewave> Bye MeteorVenture
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Night MeteorVenture
*FlaschenJoe11 brohoofs MeteorVenture in his Nightmare Moon Mech!
<NewDCD> 9also I have a PO Box in Miami since a few weeks ago...estimated delivery date is 30th of September. Then I got to wait for it to be shipped to Panama from Miami (which is about 2.50 dollars)
*Veewave accuses Natleyn of shenanigans
<NewDCD> 9 Still I chose Free Shipping from Amazon because the Figuarts is pretty expensive
<Natleyn> Nope o_o
<FreezeFrame> Okay, time for me to head to school
<NewDCD> 9 I mean my Gurren Lagann costed me 10 bucks LOL
<Natleyn> Bye Freeze.
<NewDCD> 9 I was preparing it today for posing together with Shin Ichigo btw
<FlaschenJoe11> Tschüss Freeze
*RobotPinkie accuses Natleyn of hugging people
<Veewave> Shenanigans!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...wait, that's not a bad thing
<Natleyn> RobotPinkie: Damn straight.
*Natleyn hugs RobotPinkie
<Sumica> is hugging aganced the rules now?
<NewDCD> 9>yfw I pull a Vangelous and review it live via Stream
*RobotPinkie hugs Natleyn back
<NewDCD> 9Well what I'm trying to say is that my most noteworthy toy was 10 bucks, originally 15 but I got it on a clearance sale
<Natleyn> If it is, there goes half my activity
<NewDCD> 9/me wishes he had more money for toys
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm kind of tempted to kick myself for hugging after you said that, Sumica :P
<NewDCD> 9 Also here.http://akashingou.wordpress.com/2011/09/13/review-s-h-figuarts-kamen-rider-ichigo-shin-ver/
<Sumica> lol
<NewDCD> 9And since I'm too poor to afford the Cyclone Bike
*Veewave wants moar money
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's against no rules, and I actively encourage it!
<NewDCD> 9I still have Kaneda's bike (from Akira), which I bought as a kid back in 2000. Lost the Kaneda figure though...I wonder if No.1 will fit on it well?
<NewDCD> 9Thing is I'm planning on having him ride Kaneda's Bike
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I have Cloud's bike from Advent Children. So sue me. :P
<Sumica> that's a nice bike
<NewDCD> 9Because the economy is harsh and the Riders were on a tight budget, SO THEY HAD TO BUY AN USED REPLACEMENT WHEN THE CYCLONE EXPLODED.
<NewDCD> 9hmmm
<NewDCD> 9you're actually tempting me to check prices for the Cloud Strife Play Arts here in my country
<NewDCD> 9I've seen it in several places
<EspyLacopa> RobotPinkie: But do you have Cloud's sword from Advent Children?
<NewDCD> 9The Fenrir is a badass bike, Ichigo would be pretty cool riding that shit
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, yeah EspyLacopa, the figure also came in the box
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah I agree, NewDCD
<EspyLacopa> Oh, I thought you were talking about an actual motorcycle, not a figurine.
*NewDCD puts Ichigo on the Fenrir, speeding away, with Cloud in a pose yelling to the skies something along the lines of "RIDER STOLE MY BIKE"
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, oh wow, no, I don't have that kind of money :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm poor, feel free to laugh :P
<ctrlx> RobotPinkie, piracy!
<NewDCD> 9If someday I make bigbucks as a doctor
<ctrlx> or what are we talking about
<NewDCD> 9I'll make a full-body THE FIRST cosplay with bike included
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I prefer open source, ctrlx, but to each his own.
<NewDCD> 9and then I'll ride the Cyclone everywhere
<Sumica> Just remember it's never Lupis DCD
<NewDCD> 9LIKE A RIDER BAWS
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That would be amazing, NewDCD
<NewDCD> 9Bitch, it was Lupus once
<ctrlx> RobotPinkie, as long as it's free and not apple, i'm cool with whatever
<NewDCD> 9Season 3, Episode 9
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pretty much same as me then, ctrlx, lawl
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I do pay for my games though, hehe.
<ctrlx> i pay for about half my games
<NewDCD> 9I wish Tamashii stands weren't so expensive
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, I guess that's not entirely true, I play a lot of free games...
<ctrlx> RobotPinkie, i overall pay for probably 15% of hte software i have. but the most i've spent was in games.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and I download roms, like most people :P
<ctrlx> and probably half of the games i have are old
<ctrlx> roms are piracy as well though
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I love old games, it's too bad so many aren't available anymore
<ctrlx> they're there. if you know where to look
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol yeah, I guess I'm a pirate like that :P
<ctrlx> i spent like $250 at quakecon on games
<ctrlx> :x
<NewDCD> 9 Oh wow wait
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, I can find most of them easily online, obviously. I mean in stores.
<ctrlx> but it was a super good deal
<NewDCD> 9 It's 15 bucks for THREE stands, and they don't sell them separately
<NewDCD> 9 Just as well. That's MUCH more reasonable.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15What's a Tamashii stand?
<NewDCD> http://www.shewsbury.com/2009/11/tamashii-stage-act-3-action-support.html
<ctrlx> oh japanese names
<NewDCD> http://akashingou.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/1120150.jpg
<ctrlx> you so silly
<Dashite> "You say Tomtato, I say Pimp."
<NewDCD> 9Translator's Note: Tamashii means Soul
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ahhh, that's what they are
<Veewave> Gelgoog is best pony
<NewDCD> 9DCD Note: Tamashii Nations is the Bandai Sub-division that does the SH Figuarts and Robot Damashii lines.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15and yeah, I know what it means :P
<NewDCD> 9Acguy would like to disagree
<ctrlx> i have some gundam figures. my dog chewed on one
<ValtheJean> 2,14 LEVERAGE
<ctrlx> NewDCD, i have no idea
<RobotPinkie> 06,15speaking of souls, Gintama is pretty awesome... not just because the name kind of sounds like "testicles," either
<Natleyn> What?
<ctrlx> Natleyn, help me!
<ctrlx> ;-; they're speaking in tongues
<RobotPinkie> 06,15HERP ME!
<NewDCD> http://akashingou.wordpress.com/2011/09/13/review-s-h-figuarts-ex-cyclone-first-ver/

<NewDCD> 9Sumica: not watching, just in the IRC, working in LesMis project
<Sumica> ah oh well Guess you miss it then
<ctrlx> Natleyn, i'm gonna get some cornbread, want some?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I used to follow a couple of Japanese figure blogs... not sure why I don't anymore...
<NewDCD> 9Gonna take a peek
<Natleyn> ctrlx: I'd love some! :3
<Natleyn> Cornbread is awesome.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15ARRR, I need some Kamen Rider figures
<NewDCD> 9Also USA is getting an exclusive line of DBZ SH Figuarts
<NewDCD> 9which outside of US will be Tamashii Web Exclusives
<NewDCD> 9Read:The Japanese can only buy them online
<RobotPinkie> 06,15if I found a KR Faiz figure, my head would probably explode with joy
<NewDCD> 9I think we should call them Tamashii and Amazon Web Exclusives, eh?
<NewDCD> 9Pinkie
<NewDCD> 9c'est un segunde
<Natleyn> Speaking in tongues indeed.
*ctrlx tosses Natleyn some cornbread with butter already spread

<NewDCD> 9this is the OVA of the Bartoll Incident, which was later adapted in OGG for the PS2
<Sumica> it's just the Customs
<NewDCD> 9Divine Wars covers OG1, and SUCKS due to CG mechs

<RobotPinkie> 06,15Thanks so much, NewDCD, seriously <3
<OhmyGodthisIsntWorki> ugh
<NewDCD> 9 if you like Kaix
<NewDCD> 9Kaixa
<NewDCD> 9I'd recommend you getting him first though
<OhmyGodthisIsntWorki> finally working
<NewDCD> 9Kaixa was released this month
<NewDCD> 9Faiz about a year and a half ago
<NewDCD> 9so Kaixa's architecture is much more advanced
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh I LOVE his look
<NewDCD> 9also KUSAKA RAPES MARI IN THE NOVEL
<OhmyGodthisIsntWorki> hey
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I might get Kaixa first, then
<LordCelestia> hg
<LordCelestia> ^whoops
<NewDCD> 9 let me send you a review someone posted on /toy/ for Kaixa first, then
<NewDCD> 9or be a hero and get Faiz along with it
<NewDCD> 9and then send me Agito as a gift : 3
<NewDCD> 9JK JK
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, is there an expensive Agito?
<FlaschenJoe11> they have no chance
<OhmyGodthisIsntWorki> ouch
<FlaschenJoe11> dude bloody
<ValtheJean> 2,14 THOSE BASTARDS! THEY BLEW UP SYDNEY
<Natleyn> D:
<OhmyGodthisIsntWorki> How do I change my name to LordCelestia
<RobotPinkie> 06,15What are the SIC Kiwami Tamashii figures?
<OhmyGodthisIsntWorki> \nick isnt working
<FlaschenJoe11> with /nick
<FlaschenJoe11> not \nick
<NewDCD> 9http://myfigurecollection.net/blog/1273 Kaixa Reviews
<OhmyGodthisIsntWorki> obviously
<Natleyn> you were using \nick?...
*Natleyn sighs
<OhmyGodthisIsntWorki> no, i used /nick
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey guys, I'm back from the party.
<NewDCD> 9 Pinks: S.I.C. stands for Super Imaginative Chogokin, and they redesign characters to more organic/frightening designs
<OhmyGodthisIsntWorki> the command isnt doing anything at all
<FlaschenJoe11> just /nick LordCelestia
<DashWithRainbows> how was it LunaTheForgotten ?
<Natleyn> That should work.
<NewDCD> 9Think of them as Ver.Ka. for Toku characters
<ghgh> oh but it works for THAT?
<Natleyn> >_>
<LunaTheForgotten> DashWithRainbows. Very nice.
<ghgh> ugh
<NewDCD> 9 Kiwami Tamashiis are basically S.I.C.s, but smaller
<itworks> works for me
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ver.Ka.? Not sure what that is
<itworks> now to change back
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ahhh okay
<NewDCD> 9Same design, but about half the size
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Gotcha, then
<NewDCD> 9Version Katoki
<DashWithRainbows> i dont see the problem...
<Starflower> Hrm.
<LunaTheForgotten> brb
<MantisToboggan> there needs to be an MLP episode where they find the ruins of the statue of liberty
<MantisToboggan> random thought
<ghgh> beam coto
<MantisToboggan> or rather it can just be in the background
<NewDCD> 9For example, this is the Ver.Ka.for Gurren-Lagann http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YF1tNfQVN8w/TFGUL6e9ImI/AAAAAAABIt8/QTbZT5AWYK8/s1600/1.jpg
<Natleyn> Beama coato~
<Natleyn> Damn it.
<FlaschenJoe11> GIGA DRILL BREAKAH!
<Natleyn> Now I want one.
<NewDCD> 9(I hear that Gurren Lagann figure is REALLY TERRIBAD though so don't go looking for it. It looks pretty, that is.)
<ValtheJean> 2,14 looks like they pissed off Big Mac
<NewDCD> 9However, notice the aesthetic differences
<NewDCD> 9You still recognize it's Gurren-Lagann, but redesigned
<FlaschenJoe11> Gainaxing is in full motion
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah I'm probably just going to get the Faiz and Kaixa figures, NewDCD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The SH ones
<NewDCD> 9SIC Rider 1 http://i2.squidoocdn.com/resize/squidoo_images/-1/lens18113603_13097143846943_SIC-S-I-C-Vol-14-Kam
<NewDCD> 9Pinks: did you see the review I sent you?
<NewDCD> 9 also Kamen Rider Toy General http://boards.4chan.org/toy/res/2547940#2551543
<ghgh> everytime i try to change to LordCelestia it says the name is "in use" but I disconnected from LordCelestia
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, still watching it though, NewDCD
<FlaschenJoe11> wait a bit then try again
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's looking really good so far
<LordCelestia> Screw it, I can't figure out mIRC
<ctrlx> LordCelestia, xchat2
<LordCelestia> is xchat free?
<NewDCD> 9 Also the Figuarts I want the most are Shin Ichigo (duh), Kuuga, Agito, Faiz, and Decade Violent Emotion (because the head sculpt in the original DCD is said to be not so good, and they fixed that by adding a regular-DCD head with better sculpt in the Violent Emotion release)
<ctrlx> xchat 2 is
<NewDCD> 9Oh Pinks
<LordCelestia> What about that add-on for firefox calle dChatzilla
<NewDCD> 9 I meant the Kaixa review
<NewDCD> 9 here http://myfigurecollection.net/blog/1273
<ctrlx> chatzilla is free
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wish I were richer, then I'd get you the Agito one
<ctrlx> but you need to be running firefox so it's up to you
<NewDCD> 9 lololol don't worry about it
<LordCelestia> ill download firefox
<NewDCD> 9 also Pinkie: Tamashii web exclusives are expensive as fuck overseas
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm so happy about this, haha
<ctrlx> omg steam is pissing me off
<NewDCD> 9Also man Kaixa is looking GOOD
<NewDCD> 9holy fuck those are a lot of accessories
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Still looking at the Kaixa one, but it looks amazing
<LordCelestia> OWNED
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Love how the feet can move, wow
<LunaTheForgotten> I gotta go, I was just wondering what you guys were streaming. I'll see y'all next week. Bye
<NewDCD> 9they're called FiguARTS for a reason
<Veewave> Bye LTF

<Natleyn> Awww. Okay.
<Sumica> this cold is kicking my arse
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Thanks, watching it now, yay!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm hoping his horn folds...
<Diftraku> I remember seeing the movie with japanese original dub
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ah, darn
<Diftraku> Hence I have hard time watching the english dubs :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15just when I've hit enter, he says it doesn't :P
<NewDCD> 9http://blog.livedoor.jp/hacchaka/archives/51731566.html Faiz Blaster images, very sexy
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh wow, you're not kidding... Now I want to watch some Faiz
<Natleyn> Bag of grenades.
<Natleyn> Nice.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You're the one streaming, now?
<Diftraku> "Let me reach for my... _banana bag_"
<Natleyn> So... you're an mmmmmmbeyetch who likes mmmmmmmmmmgrenades
*EspyLacopa steals the banana bag. . .
<NewDCD> 9also Faiz Axel is a tamashii web exclusive
<NewDCD> 9And I can't stream right now
<Natleyn> RAIN. <3
<Sumica> one of the better songs
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ah alright. So where do I get Tamashii web exclusives?
<Natleyn> Love the OST for this. Not all of the songs are as awesome, but there are a bunch of good ones imo
<NewDCD> 9Supposedly Japan-only
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Damn....
<NewDCD> 9because you can only buy it on the Tamashii site
<NewDCD> 9but you can buy them in other stores
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Man, I love this guy's reviews
<NewDCD> 9as in, for example, BigBadToyStore has Axel Form in stock....
<NewDCD> 9...for 75 bucks
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ouch, crap
<NewDCD> 9that's the problem with web exclusives. Expensive as FUCK.
<NewDCD> 9Just the NON-TRANSFORMING Ride Vendor of OOOs is 40 bucks because it's a Tamashii Web Exclusive
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I kinda want to try to get as many Faiz figures as I can, hehe
<ctrlx> anyone else having an issue with steam?
<EspyLacopa> Imagine a to scale Unicron toy.
<NewDCD> 9and the bikes are very expensive because of this as well. Only Hardboiler and Cyclone ver. THE FIRST are nonen-exclusives
<NewDCD> 9Get a Riotrooper. DO IT FILLY.
<NewDCD> 9also, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZqDw4tmVLw&feature=relmfu COOLGUY
<NewDCD> http://www.bigbadtoystore.com/bbts/product.aspx?product=BAN13866&mode=retail

<NewDCD> *9Axel
<Natleyn> Face grab!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Goddammit, Axel looks so damn nice, too, NewDCD
<Natleyn> Green Bird, I think.
<Sumica> yeah
<Veewave> ponychat doesn't show up in the network list.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol "Bandai China tramp stamp"
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Guess we know what Kuuga's cutie mark is, now :P
<NewDCD> 9WELL PLAYED PINKS
<Natleyn> Veewave: What are you using?
<Veewave> xchat 2
<Natleyn> Huh.
<Veewave> or mirc
*MrChang takes off his clothes slowly.
<Veewave> I got 'em both
<Natleyn> MrChang: What.
*Veewave shoots MrChang
<Natleyn> Thanks, Veewave
<Veewave> *bang bang
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Man, all those Figuarts figures look so damn good
<NewDCD> 9 also if you're going to get several Figuarts, Pinks, you might as well get these http://www.shewsbury.com/2009/11/tamashii-stage-act-3-action-support.html
<NewDCD> 9I KNOW. CRACK IS CHEAPER.
<NewDCD> 9 and there are DBZ and One Piece Figuarts, too...
<NewDCD> 9......Oh, Japan ;___;
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bETCusT5kNM <-- The Cat Came Back
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think I might take up a crack habit instead, yeah :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Nah, KR figures are much cooler than crack
<NewDCD> 9That is the only thing
<NewDCD> 9 Pinks where do you live again?
<Sumica> Sorry for cutting it short tonight but I need to rest up for work and what not.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Sweden
<Diftraku> Bit like playing warhammer: a crack habit might be cheaper but warhammer is less deadly
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So imports... might be a bit expensive
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I know quite a few Americans, thankfully
<Natleyn> Thanks for streaming Sumica! :3
*Natleyn hugs Sumica
<ValtheJean> 2,14 thanks sumica!
<NewDCD> 9but Sumica, you're closer to Japan than US is
<NewDCD> 9 Shipping from Hobbylink Japan might be cheaper
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol not Sumica
<FlaschenJoe11> Danke Sumica
<Sumica> will pop in time to time throughout the week but probably wont stream again till the saterday pony eps
<Pegacorn> Ohai everypony!
<ctrlx> i'm american! i can do american things!
<Diftraku> It's not just shipping, it's the insane customs that cranks it up :P
<NewDCD> 9DERP I MEAN PINKS
<NewDCD> 9i HERPED SO MUCH I DERPED http://www.hlj.com/
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Thanks for streaming though Sumica, I enjoyed the first episodes <3
<Natleyn> ctrlx: xD
<Natleyn> I don't know why that made me laugh, but it did.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Hmmmm, maybe it could work, NewDCD
<FlaschenJoe11> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2-cTx2kfTk&feature=related
<Sumica> oh right I should reset my router, should have my better interwebs now. Back in a second.
<FlaschenJoe11> Trixie
<NewDCD> http://www.hlj.com/product/BAN963202
*ctrlx hops in his big truck with his big beer and his big tittied wife and drives around doing american things the american way
<NewDCD> 9Regular Faiz is getting restocked though.
*FlaschenJoe11 sings "I don't want anypony else,..."
<ctrlx> lol i live in rural illinois :(
<Pegacorn> brb
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's a lot on shipping, though.... hmm, I wonder how much it is from the US
<ctrlx> steam why do you do this to me
*EspyLacopa has been playing more and more Rusty Hearts via steam
<ctrlx> i saw that game. looked meh for me.
<NewDCD> 9Pinkie: BigBadToyStore is US-Based and it can give you a shipping estimate with the different services, so add an item to your cart and check it then.
<ctrlx> but steam is just being super gay for me
<EspyLacopa> It plays like those old sidescrolling beat-em-up arcade games, like Double Dragon.
<NewDCD> 9Oh wow
<NewDCD> 9 >Sweden, USPS Air Mail, 20 bucks
<NewDCD> 9Yeaaaaaaaaah you should probably see if there's some PO Box system you can use, like me
<CriticKitten> It's pretty good, yeah. Though the first boss to really annoy me was Gloves. "Didn't block my punch? Have 120 damage and go flying. Problem with that?"
<EspyLacopa> Heh.
<EspyLacopa> I play the mage, so I just hit my handy dandy heal button.
<ctrlx> NewDCD, 20 bucks isn't much
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, I just checked, NewDCD
<EspyLacopa> And hit him from the back repeatedly.
<ctrlx> get a flat rate box
<NewDCD> 9alsoPinkie, as an alternative
<CriticKitten> Yeah, I tried to beat him with block, then I realized that the timing has to be just-so or it won't let you. So then I resorted to running away and spamming mage spells.
<NewDCD> 9Korea has their own runs of Figuarts...they're currently airing Decade there, so maybe you could buy an SH from Korea?
<EspyLacopa> I'm thinking of going back in there and just practicing the whole blocking trick until I've got it down properly.
<EspyLacopa> My Little Q, Part 2: Nice.
<Sumica> Seems I need to go yell at my isp again.
<CriticKitten> The timing's pretty tough, yeah. I may run it multiple times just to get the hang of it.
<Diftraku> Sumica, you're not the only one
<Diftraku> I should DC in 30 mins
<EspyLacopa> Running away is for pansies. I just run around to his back and start wailing on him with my magic sword and spells.
<Diftraku> Dunno why but it happens almost always at 2:36AM
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh wow, my girlfriend is just in SK, NewDCD
<Sumica> Well mine was supposed to upgrade my speed last wendsday, and they failed me so they reset it for today.
<CriticKitten> I have no problem whatsoever with playing like a pansy. :D
<Sumica> Still failed.
<CriticKitten> Especially if it works.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...I might have to convince her to look around for me
<ctrlx> i see no problem with it
<EspyLacopa> Yea, but that's not how you get the higher rankings ^_^
<ctrlx> consider it sniping vs knife fighting
<CriticKitten> Well, depends.
<CriticKitten> If you spam him and throw him off, you can slam him with a few hits to keep your ranking up.
<EspyLacopa> I went in charging melee and get triple S rank.
<ctrlx> OMG FLARIA HI
<NewDCD> 9 Pinks: HOLD ON TO THE PHONE. Gonna ask in the Rider General how to get them toys from Korea
<EspyLacopa> Can't wait for level 10 to start using a scythe.
<CriticKitten> I managed a B or so while spamming the whole way, which is "good enough" in my book. If it's above a B it fulfills the rank reqs.
<ctrlx> LONG TIME NO SEE
<CriticKitten> Same
<Flaria> HIYA CTRLX
*ctrlx shoots cornbread out of a cannon at Flaria
<LordCelestia> Hey guys
<EspyLacopa> I hope there's more "My Little Q"
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Alright, NewDCD, not ordering anything today either way, have to make really sure I can afford it first :P
<LordCelestia> I'm using ChatZilla, I got it working :D
*Flaria launches herself into the air via flames, catching the cornbread in her mouth midair
*Flaria lands gracefully
*LordCelestia claps
<EspyLacopa> I'm wondering when the fourth character in that game will be available to play.
<ctrlx> steam better get to working so i can play more oblivion
<ctrlx> game's a classic
*Flaria bows to the audience (err, just LordCelestia then)
*ctrlx tosses Flaria roses and cheers
<CriticKitten> Dunno.
<CriticKitten> But I'm liking the mage so far at least.
<CriticKitten> Will have to try the others at some point.
<EspyLacopa> I haven't even tried out the other two playable characters.
<LordCelestia> lol @ ctrlx
*Flaria picks up a rose and puts it in her hair
<EspyLacopa> I'm enjoying the whole magic spam too much.
<CriticKitten> Yeah. I usually prefer distance combat. Which is why I regret having to use my sword so much, haha.
<EspyLacopa> And Frantz seems like too much of a whiner.
*LordCelestia glomps Flaria
<AlterniaVeewave> Hi me!
<CriticKitten> I get the sense he's been listening to too much Linkin Park
<Veewave> Hi me!
<Flaria> Oblivion Players: "By the Nine Divines!"
*Flaria is glomped
*LordCelestia looks around then carries Flaria offstage out the back of the theatre
<AlterniaVeewave> STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!
<Flaria> Where are you taking me? o.o;
*DashWithRainbows has no idea what LordCelestia is up to...
*LordCelestia is taking Flaria back to his castle
<LordCelestia> muahaha
*Veewave suggest we form a mob
<Flaria> LordCelestia, pff
*ctrlx jump hides in Flaria's pocket
<Flaria> Thats not how you spell IceKing
*DashWithRainbows is still on the moon and can somehow contact you guys...
<LordCelestia> I would not bring any tpye of Ice King back to my castle
<DashWithRainbows> magic? or super leet hax?
<NewDCD> also

<Flaria> o_o
*Flaria wriggles out of LordCelestia's grasp and vanishes in a torrent of raging flames
<Pegacorn> I have returned!
<Flaria> Welcome back, Pegacorn
*ctrlx still hiding in Flaria's pocket
*LordCelestia frowns. "I just wanted to show her my theatre. I was gonna offer her a royal job opportunity but I guess it's her loss."
<Pegacorn> LordCelestia,why are you frowning?
*Veewave mounts Pegacorn
<FlaschenJoe11> okay
<Flaria> Oh well.
<LordCelestia> I was going to show Flaria my royal studio but she vanished when I was carrying her back against hyer will.
<Veewave> :)
<LordCelestia> :p
<Pegacorn> GET OFF OF ME VEEWAVE!
<LordCelestia> PIG PILE
<DashWithRainbows> signing off now guys cya!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's a hong kong site, I guess
*LordCelestia jumps on top of Pegacorn too
*Veewave rides Pegacorn like a bull this time
<Flaria> Hmph.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Are they the same models, NewDCD?
*Pegacorn has hired Nick to get rid of anypony who DARES try to ride me.
<LordCelestia> Good thing im the most powerful pony in equestria
*LordCelestia pig piles ontop of Pegacorn
<LordCelestia> :D
<Pegacorn> .....I forgot that Nick is on a vacation right now.
*Veewave does not care because riding Pegacorn is the only fun thing in life
<NewDCD> 9what do you mean models?
*Pegacorn crawls away
<NewDCD> 9well it's the prototype sculpt since the Riobot GL hasn't been released yet
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I mean the Figuarts from SK and Japan, are there differences?
*Veewave smiles (Winning!)
<NewDCD> 9 No no
<NewDCD> 9Bandai Japan just sells those in South Korea
<NewDCD> 9because they export Kamen Rider shows there
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Cool, that's very good to know
<NewDCD> 9same with the Phillipines, who get english dubs of KR
<NewDCD> 9They're like three shows behind though
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well that's okay, I'm mostly interested in Faiz and Kabuto figures
*Pegacorn falls unconsious
*Veewave is watching Priest "This is some weird stuff!"
<NewDCD> 9 Pinks, keep an eye on the General. http://boards.4chan.org/toy/res/2547940#2551664
*Diftraku had the mobile network operator send settings to my phone
<Diftraku> I got 10 frigging messages with the settings in them
<Diftraku> And need only 2
*Veewave takes all of Pegacorn's popcorn while said pony is unconscious
*LordCelestia shares popcorn with Veewave
*Veewave kicks back in chair made up of unconscious ponies
<Veewave> *pony
<LordCelestia> Guys, I feel like doing something for Bronystate Imma make a thing up on DeviantART about bronystate, like a picture.
*Pegacorn is holding a newspaper that says "In other news PEGACORN HAS WORST DAY OF FRIGGIN' LIFE"
<LordCelestia> Any ideas?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Thanks, NewDCD, I will

<Pegacorn> OW
<LordCelestia> A graduation picture for the fillies? What?
<Pegacorn> Why did you do that Veewave?
*Veewave can not be concerned with having reasons for things
*LordCelestia agrees with VeeWave and slaps him with a large trout
<Pegacorn> GODDAMNIT
<Veewave> looks like it was super effective
<LordCelestia> I meant that I hit veewave not pegacorn

<LordCelestia> grrrrr
*LordCelestia levitates Veewave back into the cannon and launches him back to the moon
*Veewave is unamused
*Veewave jumps out
<NewDCD> 9 Pinks: I ussually arrange it so things can pile up at friends places around the world (like have my shf sit with a friend in japan for a few months), sortof like BBTS pile of loot and then have a shitton of stuff shipped to you once every few months. ultimatly i save quite a bit on that. But if you cant arrange that, shipping for a single shf via sal from lets sey HLJ is like 580 yen to
<NewDCD> 9sweden (Via SAL), thats like 50kr. i think thats the same price our friends in america also pay. basically always choose the cheeper slower option if you are short on cash? ussually dosent take more then a week and a half. OR you could arrange a deal with some other swede and split the shipping cost (might be a good choice if you are ordering big things) i have done that with some local
<NewDCD> 9friends. OR just bite the bullet, we all do that from time to time
<NewDCD> finding stuff in Korea tho? no idea
*Veewave jumps on Pegacorn and holds on tight
*ArcherJoe11 turns to LordCelestia
<Nittany_Discord> 90% done with grading. The slow 10% is coming up, though.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Thanks, NewDCD , I think I actually CAN let it pile up a bit in US, so that's good
<ArcherJoe11> what's with you and your cannon?
*Veewave falls asleep
<LordCelestia> It's my way of asserting myself
<RobotPinkie> 06,15or possibly in SK, for now, if I can find out where to get stuff there
<RobotPinkie> 06,15...might have to bite the bullet with Kaixa so I have something to start with, NewDCD, I REALLY love how he looks
<Veewave> ArcherJoe11: "Big boys need bigger guns"
*Flaria leans near ArcherJoe11. "Compensation."
<ArcherJoe11> I personally prefer swords
*LordCelestia leans towards Flaria "I like to whisper too."

<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wonder if there's a Delta figure....
<sklar> so any body get some this weekand?
<ArcherJoe11> LC will just shoot you to the moon
<Veewave> For lookin' badass on a pony
<ArcherJoe11> I don't need a pony to be badass

<EspyLacopa> Are you a human that looks like an Orc?
<ArcherJoe11> no GAR! extremely manly and cool!
<Nittany_Discord> Does he look like a bitch? :p
<Veewave> Are you an orc that looks like a human?
<sklar> did you know that a10 is best pony.
<ArcherJoe11> Is that a challenge?
<LordCelestia> Nittany, NO

<EspyLacopa> What about Atomsk?
<Nittany_Discord> My brother will be here in 4 hours.

*Rainbow-Dash wanted to kill her more
<Sumica> I hate being sick.
*ValtheJean hugs sumica
<Sumica> Might have to call in dead tomarrow. It's genearly not a good idea to work with food when sick.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 "Hello boss, I appear to be dead"
<DashOrCrash> Don't call in dead.

<Flaria> Second Comic <3
<Trollestia> Poor Cereal.
*Trollestia d'awws.
<DashOrCrash> according to wikipedia, FIM first aired on October 10 last year...
<DashOrCrash> so that means Dash's REAL birthday is in 15 days!!!
<Trollestia> >implying pilot episode= Dash's birthday
<Rainbow-Dash> Who will add me on DeviantArt? I need to start making a Profile.. Lol
*Trollestia only has a dA account for trollan
<Rainbow-Dash> Thats nice. >.>
<Trollestia> Some of those people need to be woken up. I'm performing a service.
<AllisZero> I hated DA with a passion
<AllisZero> Actuall, I still do
<AllisZero> But I made one in order to get a bit more exposure, maybe be part of a few groups, get out there
<DashOrCrash> You guys should see the amount of Portal/MLP crossover art on DA
<Flaria> Huh.
<DashOrCrash> the two best series ever.
*Trollestia hates dA with the force of a thousand suns, but likes a small percentage of the artists there.
<Rainbow-Dash> http://tompreston.deviantart.com/art/The-New-Rainbow-Dash-260075063?q=boost%3Apopular%20rainbow%20dash&qo=13
<Flaria> I have a friend with a birthday on October 10th.
<AllisZero> I think I get the same amount of views from posting in an underground forum thread at the end of the internets
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol, I'm loving the new Spike is RD meme
<EspyLacopa> Milliways?
<AllisZero> It's funny because it's A CANON MEME
<DashOrCrash> Silly AllisZero, the internets have no end!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, when that happened in the ep I was like "Oh, that's SO going to be a meme"
<DashOrCrash> ...unless you count milliways, of course.
<EspyLacopa> Spike as Rainbow Dash reminds me of that pokemon, Totodile.
<Trollestia> >implying the internet doesn't have edges
<AllisZero> Brb, gonna go shower before going to bed.
<DashOrCrash> Someday, the internet will become sentient and be the greatest and most powerful troll ever.
<EspyLacopa> The trolling version of Skynet?
<DashOrCrash> Introducing, the Great and Powerful INTERNET!
<Trollestia> I for one, welcome our future troll overlord.
<EspyLacopa> Wait. What if this was Skynet's plan all along?
<Trollestia> *I,
<DashOrCrash> XD Trollestia, you are now awesome.
<Trollestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6dq_tbapBY This is the closest I get to awesome.
<Flutterguy> .

<DashOrCrash> What? nope, no "stuff' here...
<Flutterguy> Hmm.. stuff.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 SHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<ValtheJean> 2,14 DON'T LET HIM FIND OUT
<Flutterguy> D:
<DashOrCrash> about the stuff?
<Trollestia> Whoever is righteous, let him kill his father. Let him call his father names.
<Trollestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSBaaeaqHiE

<CriticKitten> Huh, didn't realize Jeff Dunham had a new special on tonight. O.o
<DashOrCrash> Yet another reason that ponies are better than drugs
<Flutterguy> 30 seconds: wut
<Flutterguy> 40 seconds: i'mokaywiththis
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you kidding? ponies ARE drugs
<Flutterguy> Val, this is true.
<Trollestia> pony=antidepressant
<Flaria> ^
<Flutterguy> ^^
<Flaria> Ponies are my drug and my anti-drug.
<DashOrCrash> Forget LSD. Try this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntIFhbtmwCc&feature=related
<Flaria> Not like I needed an anti-drug, but it fit.
<DashOrCrash> It gets trippier towards the end
<Sumica> FOR SCIENCE!

<Flutterguy> Dat steam
<Flutterguy> interface*

<LordCelestia> Trollestia, you gotta watch this
<LordCelestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eDUzTnv7SM&feature=related
<LordCelestia> It's something you would probably do
<LordCelestia> :D
<Flutterguy> Oh god I hated that sun so much.
<Trollestia> I've seen it, and yes. Yes I would.
<LordCelestia> Another sweet video
<LordCelestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu3j3Qh7sTE&feature=related
<Dermathil> >mfw I understand it isn't listening to the rock city radio
<Trollestia> Radio Vladivostok <3
<Trollestia> :(
<Dermathil> yaaaaay
<Trollestia> I heard "Little Pony" on the radio...
<Diftraku> rawr
<Dermathil> <3 that station. And I think I did to- also Trollestia
*Trollestia likes Vladivostok, Broker, and the one with the reggae.
<Diftraku> I was going to go sleeping... then I thought I'll read one fic a chapter... now 4 chapters later...
<Trollestia> GJ
<Dermathil> I was always listening to LRR.
<Dermathil> always.
<Trollestia> LRR's pretty good as well.
<Dermathil> lawl ye can hear it in the background even then
<LordCelestia> Another EPIC video (kinda) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yFB67WmuIc&feature=related

<LordCelestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQM-CRhvLnY&feature=watch_response
<Diftraku> anyhoof, I'll bugger off now, need to get some sleep in
*Flaria hugs Diftraku
<Flaria> Sleep well. (again)
<Flutterguy> Bye Diftraku
*Trollestia would have to be a summon or something.
<Sumica> so how bad is the video any ways?
<Dermathil> Sumica: it is alright
*Trollestia looks up the price of the game on Steam, since my PS3 copy's broken.
<Trollestia> It's surprisingly good.
<Trollestia> ^Sumica
<Sumica> playing at 800by600 so I can still see chat and such
<Trollestia> I miss this game.
<Sumica> but should be able to run it ok will up the quality when they get around to the speed update
<DashOrCrash> Anyone know some good games on Steam available for Mac?
<Dermathil> TF2
<Flutterguy> ^
<Nittany_Discord> I might get Alpha Protocol though I know the reviews aren't great for it and I may never touch it.
<Dermathil> the half-life series
<DashOrCrash> I WOULD already have both of those...
<Dermathil> headshot!
<Dashite> Nittany, it has enough good points that for $2 I would definitely recommend it.
<Nittany_Discord> K
<DashOrCrash> but I don't play FPS games much
<Trollestia> Headshots are the only way to fight in this game.
<Dashite> Nittany, just remember to go pistols/stealth
<Flutterguy> Wow, $2 for Alpha Protocol.. that's pretty sweet.
<Nittany_Discord> The only time I get major games on Steam is if they are either really cheap or if someone's going to let me in on a 4-pack.
<DashOrCrash> I got Civ 5 when it was 75% off, so that made me happy
<Dermathil> Civ 5 is a great game to spend an entire weekend on.
<DashOrCrash> And of course I pre-ordered Portal 2 long before the release
<FlutterBOOM> 08,1hehehehehe >>
<Nittany_Discord> I don't have much time for gaming and nearly no patience for MP gaming anymore.
<Flaria> FlutterBOOM: Wat
*Trollestia greatly prefers MP.
<Dermathil> Trollestia: everytime I tried MP, cheats were rampant.
<Trollestia> In what game?
<DashOrCrash> Portal 2 was released at 1:10 AM on a tuesday, for me.
<Nittany_Discord> I can't stand MP. I'm terrible at games like BC2 and MW2.
<FlutterBOOMx2> FlutterBoom
<DashOrCrash> I did the entire SP campaign on thursday
<FlutterBOOMx2> I explode twice as much as you do
<FlutterBOOMx2> :P
<DashOrCrash> and the entire Co-Op on friday.
*Nittany_Discord explodes.
<Dermathil> Sumica, the cars with that paintjob are affiliated with Lil' Jacob's gang
<Dermathil> just letting that out there
<Sumica> coo I guess
*Flutterguy explodes violently.
<Dermathil> aww yeah that radio station
*Trollestia loves this commercial.
<Dermathil> yeah
<DashOrCrash> I know where you guys won't be able to explode...
<Nittany_Discord> I'm listening to a stream of my local rock radio station.
*Nittany_Discord explodes
<DashOrCrash> because there's no oxygen...
*Dermathil also likes the irish mob on top of the Jamaicans.
<DashOrCrash> OOON THE MOOOOOOON BEEEEE-YIIIIIIIITCCCHES
*Trollestia rigs the moon with explosives.
<Nittany_Discord> I don't require oxygen to explode.
<Trollestia> The Irish guys are awesome, but I prefer Jacob.
<Dermathil> yeah. Patrick and Jacob are my two favourite characters.
<DashOrCrash> well, I gotta go
<Trollestia> Bye.
<Dermathil> cya DOC
*Flaria hugs DashOrCrash goodnight
<Flaria> Sleep well :3

*FlutterTree pokes Trollestia

*FlutterTree 8is amoddy
<Sumica> nico is way better then CJ
*Trollestia can relate with Niko.
<Trollestia> s/with/to
<Dermathil> Trollestia, what did you think of the bank mission?
<Trollestia> Poor Irish guys.
<Dermathil> yeah, but the mission in general was pretty darn awesome.
<Trollestia> It was, I'll admit.
<Trollestia> Remember the advert for the magical girl/mecha animu on the radio?
<Dermathil> YES
<Dermathil> and I rofled at it each time.
<NewDCD> 9 hey is robotpinkie still around?
<Dermathil> NewDCD!!!
<Flutterguy> Hey DCD
<Trollestia> I always thought that Rockstar games could be good as movies. Now I'm watching one as a movie.
<Trollestia> Ohai NCD.
*Filly_Fluttershy` 8squeaks as she turns from a tree back to pony, falling on her bum with a whimper
<Trollestia> Younger, as well.
<ItalianStallion> Oh No!
<Dermathil> LRR
*ItalianStallion picks up the filly. "Somepony help!"
*Dermathil lieks that song.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 jesus christ...
*Filly_Fluttershy` squeaks in panic "Eeeeeee!"
<Rainbow-Dash> Somepony get Twilight! Only she can fix this!... Or make it worse....

<ValtheJean> 2,14 you know those moments when people are over and you just want them to leave, but they wont?
<Dermathil> ooh

*ItalianStallion pets the little pony "Don't worry, we're going to find someone to fix this."
<Filly_Fluttershy`> 08,1you mean Flutterguy? o-o

<Rainbow-Dash> ItalianStallion.. Should we risk Twilight?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ung....sorry...brain...not working...blarg...

*Filly_Fluttershy` blinks a few times, looking down
<AllisZero> Nice driving Sumica
<AllisZero> Rofl
<Dermathil> awesome Sumica
<Rainbow-Dash> I dont think I have ever managed to crash like that
*Dermathil always took the red vehicles, since RED GOES FASTAH
<ItalianStallion> Trollestia, can you tunr her back to normal? Or somehing?
*Trollestia replants the filly.
<Rainbow-Dash> Your going to get Trollestia to help her..
<Dermathil> Sumica: be careful shooting the backtires, you can set fire to the gastank
<ItalianStallion> True
*Rainbow-Dash walks away, realizing I wont want to be here to see the end result
<ItalianStallion> holdon
*Filly_Fluttershy` squirms as she's put into the dirt, crying
<ItalianStallion> WHAT ARE YOU DOING TROLLESTIA
<Rainbow-Dash> Shes Trolling
*Trollestia re-"plants" her as well.
<Rainbow-Dash> Now find Twilight
<Rainbow-Dash> -.-
*ItalianStallion kicks trollestia with back hooves and digs up the filly, running off with her
<Dermathil> Oshi, 2stars
*Rainbow-Dash runs after ItalianStallion
<Dermathil> They be S2K now
<Rainbow-Dash> Noooo! Get Twilight Sparkle..
<ItalianStallion> "I shouldntve asked him for herlp with all his shenannigans"
<Rainbow-Dash> >.<
<AllisZero> Funny thing is, just YOU try running away that fast with your tires blown
<Filly_Fluttershy`> 08,1Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep!
<Trollestia> Meh. I tried.
<Dermathil> indeed, Allis
<Dermathil> So, who here always had the fun of driving a car in the subway tunnels?
<Sumica> I think that crash was caused by falling out of the world for a second
<AllisZero> Likely
<Sumica> Not sure what the hell that was but was a nice save =p

<Trollestia> (482)-555-0100 Health+armour+ammo
<Dermathil> Only the heli, car, boat and motorbikes
<herospirit> bloop.
<Sumica> numberpad is not working
<Dermathil> Sumica: uh?
<Trollestia> You can't be in the menu.
<Trollestia> Bring up the phone, then do the number.
<Dermathil> numlocks on?
<Sumica> yeah it's all good just cant seem to get it to work, might be cause it's windowed.
<Trollestia> You press up on the Dpad twice on PS3, dunno about PC.
<Trollestia> There we go.
<Dermathil> there you go
<Nittany_Discord> You dress up on the d-pad? :p
<Dermathil> press-up for success
*Trollestia said "press", lrn2read
<Dermathil> >you just lost all your guns
<Flutterguy> "Dress up on the D-Pad, I wonder.."
<Trollestia> [22:21:29]	<Trollestia>	You press up on the Dpad twice on PS3, dunno about PC.
<Trollestia> ffs
<Dermathil> trollestia, he's trolling you
*Trollestia is mildly annoyed, hardly mad.
<Dermathil> A CORVETTE OMG
<Nittany_Discord> I know what you said Trollestia.
<Trollestia> "Holy shit, it's a GUN"
<Trollestia> XD
<Dermathil> daw the song just ended
<Dermathil> lawl "The question isn't why? But why not?"
<Nittany_Discord> Metallica live on YT. Kick ass.
<Flutterguy> no way nittany
<ThePretender> yahweh
<ThePretender> it's Rock in RiO!
<Sumica> seems I lost my gun in that wwreck
<Nittany_Discord> Though Slipknot is on right now.
<Flutterguy> Eh.. Slipknot's.. okay.
<ThePretender> oh hai NYC
<ThePretender> I mean Liberty City
<Flutterguy> But I can't watch right now :(
<Dermathil> DAY9 IS NOW LIVE
<Trollestia> IT'S A PARADE
<Nittany_Discord> Why not Flutterguy? Copyright BS?
<Dermathil> Sumica, drop some molotovs when in those situations
<Dermathil> also, the truck at that street corner respawns. Very useful to ram through anything.
<Dermathil> OSHIT
<ThePretender> Sumica's fighting the law
<Flutterguy> Nittany, on mobile right now and my phone's YT isn't working :/
<Trollestia> Calmly talking to himself while flying through the air LIKE A BAWS
<ThePretender> and the law's...losing?
<Nittany_Discord> Oh.
<Dermathil> ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH
<Nittany_Discord> I can't watch YT or be online for long on my phone or my battery dies within 4 - 5 hours.
<Flutterguy> Same here
<Nittany_Discord> Worse off, 3G reception at my office desk sucks.
<ThePretender> exactly Dermathil
<Nittany_Discord> So I sometimes can't listen to anything at all or stream radio.
<Flutterguy> I'm actually on wireless atm.
<Flutterguy> Know the feeling of 3G at work
<Nittany_Discord> I could possibly go on wireless at the office, but the signal is protected.
<Dermathil> Sumica: Black SWAT trucks are bulletproof
<Nittany_Discord> And it's not WEP/WPA protected.
<Flutterguy> Yourworkplace's wireless signal?
<Nittany_Discord> Yeah.
<Flutterguy> That sounds a bit stupid to be hobest, J mean the no protection.
<Nittany_Discord> I can only access it via VPN (which can be unstable) or using SecureW2 (better).
<Nittany_Discord> It is protected.
<Nittany_Discord> Just not with a standard method.
<Flutterguy> Damnit, thid is why I hate IRC on my phonr, my keyboard.
<Trollestia> dat nickspam
<Dermathil> aww
<Sumica> damn blindsided spaun cop
<TrollightSparkle> More nickspam?
<Trollestia> <3
<Flaria> What the hell?
<TrollightSparkle> inb4 mods
<Sumica> they love to spwn cops on top of you
*Flaria hugs TrollightSparkle
<MoonDasher> No, just had to register them all
<Sumica> back to normal game play I guess
<TrollightSparkle> Well thak yiu
<Flaria> <)<
<TrollightSparkle> Thank you*
<Dermathil> dat idiot
<Dermathil> >running in fire like a bawss
<Sumica> Confound thesss sandboxes
<Flutterguy> Apparently, everything Nico doed is boss.
<Flutterguy> does* damnit
<Trollestia> they drive me to killing sprees
<Sumica> indeed
<Sumica> thees cars suck
<Dermathil> Sumica: the cars later are better)
*Trollestia drops people at random in RDR and noone seems to care.
<Flutterguy> Lucky Trollestia.
*Trollestia thought that was the average RDR experience.
<Dermathil> Sumica, tailgate hi
<Flutterguy> For me, it was like "Knife someone in town out of view of others, suddenly wanted".
<Trollestia> That too. It's a mixed bag.
<Flaria> I spent all my time killing animals.
<Flutterguy> I must've gotten the short end
<Flaria> Knife fights with cougars and whatnot.
<Flaria> I wasn't up to bears yet :l
<Flutterguy> o.o Flaria
*Trollestia spends lots of time on challenges.'
<Flutterguy> Knife fight with a cougar sounds.. epic.
<Spider_Jerusalem> OH SHIIIIIIIIT
<Spider_Jerusalem> COUSIN
<Spider_Jerusalem> COUSIN
<Spider_Jerusalem> COME HANG OUT COUSIN
<Flaria> Flutterguy: I was scared of cougars until I was tired enough to knife fight one
<Spider_Jerusalem> THAT'S A MIGHTY FINE HORSE YOU HAVE THERE MR. MARSTON
<Flaria> Now I go crazy screaming about cougars everytime I see one
<Shadowman> NewDCD, please kick Shadowmane for me, if you would.
<Shadowman> or Prince-Dari, Wrek, ValtheJean
<Sumica> Big american TT'S
<Flutterguy> Ii didn't get too far into RDR, I sold it after about a week.
<Spider_Jerusalem> *RING RING RING*
<Spider_Jerusalem> COUSIN, LET US GO BOWLING
<Shadowman> that's fine, thanks ValtheJean
<Trollestia> The story isn't one to be missed, Flutterguy.
<Spider_Jerusalem> *RING RING RING*
<Spider_Jerusalem> COUSIN!
<Spider_Jerusalem> LET US GO TO BAR!
<Flutterguy> It wasn't really the story Trollestia, iit was just.. so slow.
*Trollestia likes the slowness.
<Flutterguy> I'm hit and miss with pace.
<Flutterguy> I can like or dislike fast and slow paced games.
<Trollestia> I'm not picky about pace. Just so long as it isn't too far to either extreme.
<Flutterguy> Right now though, I'm obsessed with Uncharted 2, TF2, and Terraria.
<Flutterguy> All very great.
<Dermathil> I usually don't care for the pace. So long as I get my share of adrenalin, I'm happy.
<Flaria> Yay Terraria!
<Trollestia> I've been playing lots of TF2 while waiting for a PS3 part.
*Flutterguy brohoofs Flaria, yes!
<Flaria> I've been 100%-ing it since 1.0.3 -___-
*Flaria brohoofs Flutterguy
<Flutterguy> I just got into it actually.
<Flaria> I'm being lazy right now, though.
<Flaria> I don't feel like trying to get the
<Flaria> The uhh.
<Flaria> The new Jungle Rose.
<Flutterguy> My friend was like "Here try this", 3 minutes later, I'm reaching for my wallet to buy it.
<Dermathil> Jungle rose ain't new
<Flutterguy> I'm a noob ._
<Flutterguy> Only have Silver and Iron armor atm lol.(
<Flutterguy> But a couple of Gold tools
<Flaria> Dermathil: Old jungle rose was turned into Jungle Spores
<Dermathil> yes
<Flaria> New jungle rose has a shit drop rate
<Dermathil> >yfw I think I still got one
<Flaria> Don't feel like getting it right now.
<Flutterguy> Jungle rose?
<Dermathil> yes
<Dermathil> I think I got a new one
<ValtheJean> 2,14 jesus, I don't think this game can get more political
<Flutterguy> What's jungls rpse?
<Flutterguy> rrose*
<Trollestia> Global warming's a hoax, just like World War 2!
<Flutterguy> ROSE* OHMYGOD
<Dermathil> Valthejean, that's just parodies.
<Flaria> It's a head slot vanity item
<Dermathil> indeed
<Dermathil> LIBERTY ROCK RADIO
<ValtheJean> 2,14 parody my ass
<Dermathil> IT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM ROCKING
<Flaria> It's too bad I don't feel like memorizing the potion recipes.
<Dermathil> Valthejean, they're just joking about Fox News with Weasel News.
<Trollestia> Faux News <3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, and?
<Flutterguy> I see what you did there Trollestia.
<Dermathil> They aren't to be taken seriously
<Trollestia> Also, some of their clips of liberals talking about guns sound frighteningly real.
<Dermathil> Because if you do, what's down the road is the same train of thoughts that bring people to say that games like GTA are the cause for a spike in violent crimes (when they really are just becoming rarer)
<Trollestia> "Damn rednecks get your semiautomatic death machines out mah city" and whatnot
<ValtheJean> 2,14 sigh...you're missing the point...but it isn't worth getting into ANOTHER one of these debates
<Dermathil> indeed
<Flutterguy> Dermathil Funny story about that.. I had that mindset for a while then I realized, it's a game.(
<Dermathil> Flutterguy: eh.
<Trollestia> It's a very political game, but I love it for that.
<Flutterguy> I dunno, I was thinking of getting GTA4
<Dermathil> There are really people who think that violent crimes are becoming more common due to games like GTA.
*Flaria shrugs
<Trollestia> That's depressing.
<Flutterguy> There are people who think video games in general are worse than "music" of today.((
<Trollestia> Drawfaggery, I go.
<Flutterguy> Which pisses me off ever so much.
<Dermathil> Trollestia, the stats actually demonstrate that violent crimes are becoming less common, since most people who think about commiting those crimes actually vent their frustrations on their videogames instead of people now
<Trollestia> I believe that.
<Xian217> Seems likely.
*Flaria hugs Flutterguy
<Flaria> Welcome back~
<Flutterguy> ohai
<Flutterguy> Was switching from phone back to my computer.
<Dermathil> Sumica, make your choice. You gonna kill him? Or you gonna let him go?
*Trollestia almost always lets him go.
<Trollestia> Dem mad parhour skills
<Trollestia> parkour
<Dermathil> nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
<Dermathil> Q_Q
<Sumica> seemed more fun
<Trollestia> http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lCA-yPeV-Tw/Tn_NjZJhJhI/AAAAAAAABEI/mf-6P1AvfVM/s1600/twilight_reading_three_books_by_kp_shadowsquirrel-d4avali.jpg
<Dermathil> eh, I think if he survives you meet him again
*Trollestia likes how pentacles are associated with magic instead of satanism nowadays.
<Dermathil> Trollestia, they are only associated with satanism when upside down.
<Sumica> FFFFFFFFFFF
<Dermathil> LOL
<Dermathil> HAHAHAHAHAHHAAH
<Flaria> :3
<Trollestia> I know that, but I've met some people who stubbornly swear otherwise.
<Trollestia> Also, accept then call again and call it off for no relationship loss.
<Dermathil> Oh gosh. I hate the cabaret club.
<Trollestia> BIG AMERICAN TTS
<Dermathil> the shows at the comedy club are just so much better and genuinely funny.
<Sumica> it not unlocked yet
<Rainbow-Dash> Bedtime. Bye everpony
<Dermathil> I know, and that's a shame, sumica.
<Trollestia> G'night.
<Flaria> Sleep well Rainbow-Dash!
*Flaria hugs Rainbow-Dash
<Dermathil> >CABLES
<Trollestia> He stopped focusing and she fell. FUCKING MAGIC
<Dermathil> indeed.
<Sumica> next time I go drinking >_<
<Trollestia> We are all that little girl sometimes. But we don't fall off.
<Trollestia> We FLY
<Dermathil> She's prolly the best of the entire show
<Dermathil> oh, this mission.
*Trollestia plays "Room on Fire" or whatever the name is
<Dermathil> oh you...
<Trollestia> Mmm, potatoes.
<Trollestia> Vodka <3
<Trollestia> Nice shooting.
<Dermathil> ffff
<Sumica> thanks
<Trollestia> DISREGARD EXECUTION
<Trollestia> ACQUIRE HEADSHOT
<Dermathil> you didn't even do the execution
<Sumica> got the job done did't it?
<Dermathil> yeah but he didn't get shot in the eye
<Sumica> looked that way to me =p
<herospirit> What's on the stream?
<Dermathil> nah I think you put the gun in the eye and pull the trigger, looks more awesome.
<Trollestia> GTA 4
<herospirit> I'm not on the website it's on, so. :P
*Dermathil only ever got to the missions with the 1st of the 2 remaining living guys
<Sumica> will keep that in mind
<Flutterguy> Like how the police don't care about driving :P
<Sumica> would be too hard to code I think
<Flutterguy> Yeah.
<Sumica> oh ffff rain
<Flaria> ... I sure have a lot of favourite people here.
<Flutterguy> Oh really?
<Flutterguy> Oh snap.
<Flutterguy> Ow.
<Sumica> cupcakes any one?
<Flutterguy> o.o
<Dermathil> lawl
<Trollestia> Why *do* they call it a hacksaw?
<Flaria> Trollight, EspyLacopa, ctrlx, Fluttershy`, Whatpayne, Xerion, Diftraku, RobotPinkie as a friends...
<Flaria> Hacking is what I do with the knife?
<Pinkamina> :3
<Flutterguy> Oh nooooo
*Flutterguy flys away.
<Pinkamina> NewDCD and Sumica for Mecha <3
<Dermathil> And that was the move that made me temporarily like that guy.

<Trollestia> MFW
<Dermathil> heheheh
<Flaria> ctrlx: What do you have? o.o
<herospirit> Nnnngannnnnng stomach. GODDAMMIT STOMACH
<herospirit> (mfw "Goddammit" recognized by spell check)
<ctrlx> Flaria, i have no idea. bagels, ramen, left over tacos, um.... cereal...
<Flaria> herospirit's stomach: Behave you :l
<CriticKitten> Oof, you too?
<CriticKitten> I swear, if an alien pops outta my stomach, I'm not gonna be surprised. :|
<herospirit> I already puked my guts up two nights ago, stomach
<herospirit> What more do you want!?
<Flutterguy> herospirit It hungers.. for more.
<Flaria> ctrlx: I'd have a bagel and some ramen, but that's just me.
<Flaria> mfw I only recently find out how good ramen is when you boil water instead of microwaving it
<herospirit> Good luck with your alien baby stomach, Critic.
<Flaria> D:
<ctrlx> Flaria, both? never thought bout that. sounds fine to me :3
<ctrlx> it bothers me when people drain the water out of ramen
<CriticKitten> Same to you and your puke-filled one. :(
<CriticKitten> Stomachaches suck.
<herospirit> :[
<Trollestia> You don't drain it, that's missing the point.
<ctrlx> WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOURE DUMPING OUT ALL HTE FLAVOR
<Flaria> ctrlx: I have a lot of unrelated things that I eat together because one isn't enough.
<Sumica> getting better at those head shots
<Flutterguy> You drink the broth afterwards :3 or is that just me?
<herospirit> You gotsa drain some of the water BEFORE you add the flavoring!
<ctrlx> Flaria, they'll work fine enough
*ctrlx trots off to make some din dins
<herospirit> But leave enough for the broth!
<Flaria> Like yesterday I had cheese doodles, twizzlers, ramen, yogurt and orange juice for a snack.
<herospirit> Goddammit now I'm sick AND hungry.
<Flutterguy> Mm, same.
<Flaria> You drink the broth afterward~
<Flutterguy> That's right!
<herospirit> YES!
<Flutterguy> That is, assuming you don't burn your mouth and throat doing it.
<Flutterguy> :|
<herospirit> But don't have too much water in for the broth, or else the flavoring gets diluded.
<herospirit> NNNG
<Sumica> ohhhhhh
<herospirit> making myself hungry.
<Flaria> I took the burn :D
<LordCelestia> Guys, I gotta go to bed now
<LordCelestia> stupid school nights -_-
<herospirit> Night, M'lord.
<Flutterguy> Bye LordCelestia
<Flutterguy> And I know that feel.
<Trollestia> Good night.
<LordCelestia> night hero and flutterguy and trollestia
<Flaria> Sumica <3
*Flaria hugs LordCelestia goodnight
<CriticKitten> Hm, point. It's Sunday innit....I should probably go to bed too. xD
<Flaria> Sleep well!
<herospirit> Man, I dunno if I can make school tomorrow.
<Trollestia> dat slo-mo
<Flaria> I'm going to bed in 19.
<LordCelestia> GUYS before I go, I wanna advertise something
<LordCelestia> http://theitalianstallion99.deviantart.com/art/MoonDasher-Rainbows-Cousin-260266794
<LordCelestia> This is an example of a pony profile
<Flutterguy> I'm going to bed.. eventually :l
<Trollestia> I have work tomorrow, but fuck it.
<CriticKitten> Dunno if I want to. My students disturb me with their distinct lack of pony-recognition. :| Oh well, g'night!
<LordCelestia> I can make these for anyone who wants them with different text, color, editing, all that stuff
<Flutterguy> Night Critic
<Flutterguy> CriticKitten tab fail :/
<herospirit> I made the first four school weeks with only one sick day and thought maybe I could keep under the 10 day limit this semester.
<herospirit> But OF COURSE NOT.
<LordCelestia> alright buh-bye
<Flaria> CriticKitten: Goodnight?
*Flaria hugs CriticKitten goodnight
<Flaria> Sleep well :3
<herospirit> Night Critic and Celestia!
<CriticKitten> Naw, have mIRC. So I can leave the chat open and still go to bed. :p
<herospirit> Nnng. Really, the number of my sick days is the least of my worries. I just don't want to be sick anymore.
*Sumica trives by brail
*herospirit thinks back to his days as a small child, filled with tomfoolery and happiness, and not being ill.
<Sumica> So any one here like jeff Dunham?
*herospirit isn't sure if he can actually remember that far back anymore.
*Flutterguy remembers the times that he almost feigned illness so he wouldn't have to go back to school.
<herospirit> They said I could become anything I wanted
<herospirit> ...they lied.
<herospirit> :I
<Flutterguy> They said I could become anything I wanted..
<Flutterguy> So I became pony.
<Flutterguy> :)
<herospirit> Flutterguy, if only.
<Flaria> xD
<Trollestia> They said I would never be anything...
<Trollestia> So I became a gun nut living off the land.
<Trollestia> :D
<Flutterguy> So you said "Fuck that, I'm going to the moon."
<Trollestia> That too.
<herospirit> They said I would never become anything...
<Sumica> guy has anger issues
<Flaria> They told me I'd never be anything. :l
<herospirit> so I became nothing instead.
<Flaria> Then I made stuff.
<Flaria> And parkour.
<Flaria> I'm resident ninja to a few places.
<Trollestia> You're a traceur?
*Flaria nods
*Flutterguy wants to get into parkour but can't.
<Trollestia> I thought I was the only one here.
<ctrlx> finally
<ctrlx> a bagel and ramen
<ctrlx> :33
*herospirit could only do parkour long before he knew what parkour was.

<herospirit> Okay guys, watch this vid with me. It's some of the "best" scenes from a horrible movie. My friend told me to watch it, to see how "so bad it's good" this movie is.
<herospirit> I haven't seen it yet, so I can't tell you what to expect
<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwSTDzaZ234
<ctrlx> i'm a.... o-o i have no idea

<Flutterguy> Birdemic?

<herospirit> XD
<DSNesmith> *swings coat hangers wildly*
<herospirit> DSN
<herospirit> If I get the B Movie....
<DSNesmith> the editing in Birdemic is downright criminal
<ctrlx> guys i feel like i'm back in high school
<Flutterguy> Hitchcock's The Birds.
<herospirit> You know what to expect.
<ctrlx> i haven't been back in high school since i was back in high school
<herospirit> LOL.
<DSNesmith> birdemic makes me ashamed to watch movies
<herospirit> The exploding bird clipart! The horror!
<ctrlx> i don't really care for birds
<DSNesmith> oh god the bird.gif monsters
<ctrlx> chickens are cute though :3
<ctrlx> bok bok
<Flaria> exploding... bird... clipart?
<Flaria> D:
<DSNesmith> the birds

<Sumica> Not done yet. have somthing a bit specal
<Flaria> Oh? :3
<DSNesmith> watch as our intrepid heroes bravely defend their car on the abandoned highway
<DSNesmith> er, the highly populated highway
<Dermathil> Sumica: dat Normandy wallpaper
<DSNesmith> and by defend I mean swing coat hangers ineffectually
<herospirit> Ahaha, oh my god. I am so using this as a B movie suggestion.
<DSNesmith> birdemic is soul-suckingly bad
<DSNesmith> the main "actor" deserves a prison sentence
<herospirit> I know. Maybe bad enough to beat bronystate.
<DSNesmith> don't
<DSNesmith> please
<Flaria> Don't go there.
<DSNesmith> Babes in Toyland nearly broke us
<Flaria> We're not trying to compete.
<DSNesmith> Birdemic would kill us all
<herospirit> I know. And Birdemic...
<Trollestia> Stream is off?
<herospirit> WILL DESTROY YOU
<DSNesmith> the best part about birdemic
<DSNesmith> is that the director genuinely thinks he made a good movie
<DSNesmith> James Nguyen
<DSNesmith> it's a love story
<herospirit> This makes "The Room" look like a fuckking masterpiece
<DSNesmith> between a young model and a cardboard box
<Sumica> ok back up
<Flutterguy> Aw damn, Jeff Dunham.
<Trollestia> "The Room" is a fucking masterpiece.
<Sumica> and yes normandy wallpaper
<Flaria> herospirit, you absconding to bed with me?
<DSNesmith> the room is a special movie
<herospirit> ....
<Flaria> Not like that :l
<herospirit> Flaria, rephrase that question.
<DSNesmith> it is to date the only movie that has made me burst out laughing at the FIRST line of dialogue
<Flutterguy> wut
<Flaria> herospirit, are you going to bed at the same time as I am?
<Sumica> Babes in toy land got the offce space treatment.
<Flaria> ie: now.
<herospirit> About now, yeah
<Flaria> Kay.
*Flaria hugs herospirit
<herospirit> I may cheat and stay up another like eight minutes
<ctrlx> Flaria, if you're going to bed i just wanna let you know
<ctrlx> that my ramen is cooled down now
<DSNesmith> RBD... app?
<herospirit> The dialouge in Birdemic is genious
<DSNesmith> do want
<DSNesmith> the "dialogue"
*Flaria hugs sumica, Flutterguy, Trollestia, DSNesmith , Dermathil, ctrlx
<DSNesmith> ftfy
<Trollestia> G'night.
*DSNesmith waves g'night to flaria
<ctrlx> oh i see, i'm last D:>
<Flaria> ctrlx: Yay :3
<herospirit> "Hi. The eagles killed our friends. Do you have a phone?"
<Dermathil> cya Flaria
*Flutterguy hugs Flaria good night!
*ctrlx hug Flaria
<ctrlx> gnite silly filly :33
<herospirit> Night Flaria! May your dreams be filled with Ponies that pony pony!
<Flaria> Sleep well all of you! :3
<Dermathil> is that song...
<DSNesmith> wait till the ending of birdemic
<Dermathil> ZZTop?
<Flaria> You too herospirit, my little beta tester <3
<DSNesmith> they go to the beach
<DSNesmith> and the movie ends
<DSNesmith> it's exactly as retarded as it sounds
<herospirit> XD
<Flutterguy> I've looked up Birdemic.. and I'm already disappoint.
<herospirit> The trailer for the movie is great.
<herospirit> "MEET ROB!" *rob walks in* "HI."
<DSNesmith> did you see the clapping scene
<Sumica> hey my guilds name
<Kencolt> Fun with puppets.
<DSNesmith> seriously the worst part of birdemic is the editing
<herospirit> "HE'S IN LOVE WITH A YOUNG MODEL DRIVEN BY" *voice drops two octaves* "PASSIOOOON...."
<DSNesmith> the guy who edited that footage
<DSNesmith> deserves to have his license revoked
<DSNesmith> his BREATHING license
<Kencolt> Passion. That would be FLuttershy.
<herospirit> VE GO
*Trollestia doesn't have a phone, but wants the app.
<Flutterguy> What the hell. I see the trailer for this and I've gotta say, what the hell.
<DSNesmith> yeah birdemic is a rare level of bad
<Flutterguy> No words can describe.
<DSNesmith> plan 9 level
<DSNesmith> utter incompetence combined with optimism
<DSNesmith> it's a beautiful combination
<Sumica> what are you all talking about?
<DSNesmith> Birdemic
<DSNesmith> shock and terror
<herospirit> Oh my god, ahaha. I'm DEFINITELY suggesting this if I get a B movie lottery win.
<Flutterguy> herospirit do it.
<herospirit> I heard a roomer DSN
<Kencolt> Are you saying there is a filmm that comapres with PLan 9?
<DSNesmith> okay, I'm still going with House of the Dead though
<herospirit> A ROOOOOOOMER
<Flutterguy> When is the lottery for the movie pick btw?
<Dermathil> saturday
<Dermathil> in 2 weeks
<Flutterguy> Alright.
<Dermathil> I think
<Sumica> I still want labrinth.
<Flutterguy> :l
<DSNesmith> so did they confirm my suspicions about next week's movie?
<Dermathil> I STILL WANT CUBE/APOCALYPSE NOW
<DSNesmith> a "bee" movie, if you will
<Dermathil> DSNesmith: eeeenope
<Trollestia> Is Full Metal Jacket in the running?
<DSNesmith> oh, lawl, cube
<Flutterguy> Lol Full Metal Jacket would be awesome.
<DSNesmith> if one week I am feeling evil
<DSNesmith> I will suggest Grave of the Fireflies/A Serbian Film for A/B
<DSNesmith> that would be the worst BMN ever
<Kencolt> OMG. That was SILLY beyond BELIEF.
<hero_spirit> mfw the chat closes to keep my from telling my horrible rumor.
<hero_spirit> What would be the worst BMN? What was silly beyond belief?
<Kencolt> That dummy.
<DSNesmith> A: Grave of the Fireflies. B: A Serbian Film.
<hero_spirit> DSN
<DSNesmith> even ponies couldn't save that
<hero_spirit> I heard.
<hero_spirit> The maker of Birdemic.
<DSNesmith> a roomer
<DSNesmith> yeah
<Flutterguy> I'm sitting here. And I'm watching part of birdemic. LOLOL
<hero_spirit> Is working on a sequel.
<Sumica> Btw Babes in toyland was so bad we have a new rule for moviees that bad.
<DSNesmith> birdemic II, electric boogaloo
<DSNesmith> babes in toyland
*DSNesmith never saw one fucking babe in toyland
*Flutterguy didn't get to see Babes in Toyland :l
<DSNesmith> didn't "get"
<Dermathil> Sumica: what's the rule?
<Kencolt> THe dummy got a haircut.
<hero_spirit> the "Worst Movies Clause"
<Sumica> Movies deemed that bad will not get a second showing ever.
<Sumica> not even the next day
<hero_spirit> Welp, I got to go now.
<Flutterguy> Bye herospirit!
<hero_spirit> Night everyone
<Kencolt> AHHHHH! SCARY DUMMY!
<Sumica> they are even thinking of Pre-viewing them
<hero_spirit> May your dreams be filled with Pony
<hero_spirit> ...and not Birdemic.
<hero_spirit> :D
<Trollestia> If we start previewing, I want in.
<Kencolt> There is not enough pony to erase that dummy.
<Trollestia> Nonsense.
<Sumica> just think of twi as the major again.
<Kencolt> That makes me feel better...
<Diftraku> G'morning

<DSNesmith> oh wow this movie
<DSNesmith> Rock 'em Sock 'em, the movie
<Dermathil> Sumica, that's not the movie he chose
<DSNesmith> starring hugh jackman
<Sumica> ah
<Dermathil> he chose Spider's Web, like DSN said
<DSNesmith> I can't tell if that commercial is serious, or an intentional joke
<Sumica> btw Incase you did't notice this is live tv.
<Kencolt> THe ads suggested as much.
<Diftraku> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mmcGVe5LDs&feature=player_detailpage
<DSNesmith> I prefer the classic
<DSNesmith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8VPmtyLqSY
<DSNesmith> or the elevator version
<DSNesmith> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO4pJstv_TM
<Kencolt> WTF?
<Trollestia> I'm tempted to start smoking just to troll all these campaigners.
<Kencolt> A... goat?
<Sumica> Now now Kencolt, dont judge
<DSNesmith> lol'd at maaaaargaret
<Kencolt> HEY! WHAT'S NWRONG WITH BARNYARD ANIMALS?
<Sumica> *cough*

<DSNesmith> when life gives you lemons, go into standup
<Kencolt> Walter never was happy...
<Kencolt> OK. TMI.
<Trollestia> "Yes it do-oes"
<Sumica> >_<
<Kencolt> And Walter just crossed... something. Not sure what, but something.
<Sumica> crossed a rather large line
<Kencolt> Eaten?
<Kencolt> The Wolf May Just start judging.
<DSNesmith> impressive echo effect
<Sumica> indeed
<DSNesmith> I always enjoy when ventriloquists do stuff like that
<Diftraku> Oh bucking yes...
<Diftraku> Winamp is serving today
<Kencolt> Amsterdam?
<Diftraku> I queue a playlist, first song to play on shuffle: PinkiePieSwear - Trixie's Good Side
<Kencolt> OH.
*Trollestia picks music manually.
<Diftraku> This is going to be a good morning
*Dermathil waves
<Kencolt> Bad mental images...
<Dermathil> I gotta rest for my philosophy class at 8AM (22 past midnight here)
<Flutterguy> Bye Dermathil!
*Kencolt is a good wolf. He's a good wolf. He's a good wolf. HE SAID TWI--
*Trollestia realises it's morning now.
<Sumica> night Dermathil
<Diftraku> I got 3 hours of electric safety and then I'm off to home
<DSNesmith> oh boy tosh
<Flutterz> O'Bama
<Trollestia> I DESPISE THAT FOAL
<DSNesmith> when offensive humor isn't far enough, tosh takes it to the next (absolutely hilarious) level
*Trollestia would love to put a few rounds through tosh's neck.
<DSNesmith> now now
<Trollestia> srsly
<Flutterz> Those aren't the droids you're looking at...
<DSNesmith> you have to realize his schtick is taking everything way past the point of taste
<Trollestia> I don't care about taste.
<Trollestia> He doesn't even know what he's talking about.
<Kencolt> I undertsand Tosh, He goes for the throat.
<Sumica> I love how every one is still hipeing 4g when cureently 4g might get shutdown due to in interfering with milatary gps
<Kencolt> They are getting in while they can?
<Trollestia> I can respect people going for vitals, but he doesn't go about right.
<DSNesmith> you're being vague
<Nittany_Discord> Finally, Metallica is on.
<DSNesmith> wow, that pringles face must have been expensive
<DSNesmith> or CGI...
<Sumica> *sigh* US advertising saddens me at times.
<DSNesmith> the gyrobowl
<Trollestia> *sigh* Capitalism saddens me at times.
<DSNesmith> you should see our infomercials
<Flutterz> all advertising saddens me all the time
<DSNesmith> the magic bullet
<Kencolt> Not nealy as odd as some Japanese ads...
<Sumica> or the baby bullet
<DSNesmith> our infomercials have trope entries
<DSNesmith> that's how awesome they are
<Kencolt> The Baby Bullet gives me the shivers.
<Sumica> I did like the remix of slap chop.
<Flutterz> I thought this joke had /died/ long ago
<Trollestia> BILLY MAYS HAS THE POWER TO DESTROY GERMANY'S MILITARY
<DSNesmith> ymmv, but jeff dunham stopped being funny years ago

<Trollestia> Nah, FedEx a cow's heart.

<Sumica> Hope they are better then the fedex guys we get around here.
<Kencolt> The medical community considers it the best provider.

<Kencolt> WIERD AL CONCERT? YEAH.
<Sumica> back up
<Sumica> nice comeback
<Sumica> oki Desktop pony came up and twilight is still wandering around but I cant find her.
<Sumica> nm
<Nittany_Discord> My Rock in Rio stream is skippy :<
<Trollestia> I've already heard the two Silva Hound songs, but the first one sounds interesting.
<Sumica> poor stage hand.
<Trollestia> EQD
<Trollestia> Y U SO SLOW
<Diftraku> aaand we're live! (on highway to helsinki atm)
<Diftraku> love it when I have to commute 50km per direction everyday
<Sumica> sounds FUn
<Diftraku> it is quite
<Sumica> I wonder if his arm gets sore after a while.
<Diftraku> I normally would be on the bus but my mom has almost the same commute so she drops me to helsinki and I use the bus to get to the polytechnic
<Diftraku> cheaper fares when you're travelling in the same zone
<Sumica> I dont even think it's 50 mi across the whole valy here.
<Diftraku> heh
<Diftraku> Finland: land of the long distances
<Sumica> bad trafic is it takes 30 min to get home instead of 15
<Diftraku> pretty much everything is far apart from each other
<Diftraku> about an hour from home to city centre by bus
<Diftraku> longer by car
<Sumica> that seems backwards
<Diftraku> we're at the end of the highway right outside the zone and it's gridlocked
<Diftraku> bus lanes get priority at morning and afternoon
<Sumica> ah
<Diftraku> got to hop out soon to move to the local traffic, might make it to the earlier one at this rate
<Diftraku> later :3
<Sumica> take care.
<Sumica> I find my self wondering how many are actaly watching here still.
<Sumica> oki night all.

*Trollestia doesn't bother with the poker face.

<Trollestia> I look like I'm tired and PTSD'd.

<Luna> 07,1well pics must be made!
<Diftraku> And I've been bothering Dusky :3
<Dusky> XD
<Luna> 07,1bothering dusky hmm
<Dusky> All bother Dusky eventually ;-)
<Dusky> As long as you don't cause enough trouble that I have to open up a file on you, it's all good.
<Luna> 07,1I would never do such :)
<Diftraku> :3
<MeteorVenture> a text file?
<Dusky> I should hope not.
<MeteorVenture> paper cuts all around
<Rainbow-Dash> Morning
<Dusky> MeteorVenture: I'm partial to PDF files
<Diftraku> I shall need blind bag #1 and #13
<Diftraku> aka Pinkie Pie and Cheerilee
<Diftraku> Dusky, mind poking Zaco about protecting the e-mail addresses on the front page?
<Diftraku> Just something that caught my eye when I had a look at the source
<Dusky> O_o
<Dusky> Thanks for the heads up, Diftraku!
<Diftraku> With something like http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/
<Diftraku> So the spam bots won't get it
<Diftraku> No probs, I have an OCD over these xD
<Dusky> So does he, that's why it's taking so long
*Dusky is almost tempted not to tell him, so that it doesn't take even longer...
<Dusky> Yay, done work.
<Dusky> Now onto caffeine procurement
<Diftraku> heh
<Diftraku> Just a word of advise: having something like Wordpress handling the dirty work of managing the content makes it a ton easier than just having to manually update the templates and stuff
<Dusky> I know
<Diftraku> Even if it's just static pages xD
<Dusky> (But don't let on that I can do websites)
<Diftraku> :P
<Diftraku> holy...
<Diftraku> Ep1 biggest age group: 1317
<Diftraku> 13-17*
<Diftraku> 18-24 right after

<Xeross> Diftraku: So much geekyness in that picture xD
<Diftraku> :P
<Xeross> Is the WoW mouse actually comfortable to game with?
<Diftraku> That mousemat is actually great
<Diftraku> It is
<Diftraku> If you got a big hand
<Rainbow-Dash> Forget the mouse
<Diftraku> It takes a while to get used to
<Rainbow-Dash> The ponies are the real prize :P
<Diftraku> :P
<Xeross> Mine's average sized I'd say
<Xeross> My keyboard/mouse/mousemat is all Razer
<Diftraku> But all-in-all, the manliest thing I did this week
<Xeross> Shit, yeah, I should've mentioned the ponies first
<Diftraku> And it's still Monday!
<Xeross> They used the same mould for both Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy?
<Xeross> HOW DID I NOT SEE THAT THE HAIR WAS WRONG
<Dusky> 'Later

<MeteorVenture> where do these things store up?
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I mean, they were deviations
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I'm subscribed to three MLP clubs lol

<prince-dari> The reminds me.
<prince-dari> I lost my phone. >_>
<Fluttershy`> 08,1You what? D:
<Fluttershy`> 08,1That's not good at all!
<Rainbow-Dash> Lost your phone.. A smartphone?
<MeteorVenture> i'm feeling generous.. so copy/paste everything to my msn and i'll copy/paste it back on your computer
<prince-dari> Yeah, woke in the field on Sunday, phone was gone.
<MeteorVenture> lolol
<Fluttershy`> 08,1MeteorVenture it's not so simple as that, blegh. There's a way to do it, it's just sloooow lol
<Diftraku> http://ryuukiba.deviantart.com/art/NMM-Discorded-260035494
<MeteorVenture> phones are pretty inconvenient
<Fluttershy`> 08,1sometimes
<Fluttershy`> 08,1sometimes they're super convenient
<Fluttershy`> 08,1just depends :P
<Fluttershy`> 08,1it was made for communication
<Fluttershy`> 08,1and it does that well at least XD
<Fluttershy`> 08,1them phones were made for talkin' and that's just what they'll dooo~
<MeteorVenture> lol ya and if i get a phone.. i hope it can still do that
<Rainbow-Dash> Smartphones were made so that people could do stupid things
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I have a little blue slider phone with a qwerty keyboard XD It's adorable
<MeteorVenture> like cleverbot
<Rainbow-Dash> MeteorVenture, do you have a Deviantart? I want to start adding people and stuff
<Diftraku> http://europamaxima.deviantart.com/art/Big-Macintosh-the-Dog-260026604
<MeteorVenture> i do but i don't use it socially
<prince-dari> And one of these days them phones will talk all over you?
<Rainbow-Dash> Ah
<Fluttershy`> 08,1prince-dari YES
<Fluttershy`> 08,1<3
<MeteorVenture> i have made a couple comments and stuff here and there (like 3 over the 2 or so years i've had the account lol) but i haven't even watched anyone or anything like that
<Rainbow-Dash> Me either. I am just now starting to prepare to use DeviantArt for something
<Rainbow-Dash> Of course, I cant draw :P
<MeteorVenture> i use youtube and more recently facebook for that
<Rainbow-Dash> Hmm
<Rainbow-Dash> I dont really like to use Facebook
<MeteorVenture> oh i hate it
<Rainbow-Dash> I only have an account on there to keep in touch with a couple of friends
<MeteorVenture> but i don't get to choose where people hang out
<Apokalipse> Hello Bronystate!
<Rainbow-Dash> Hey Apokalipse
<Apokalipse> I
<Apokalipse> use facebook for birthdays
<Apokalipse> Because I suck at remembering dates
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol
<Rainbow-Dash> I want to get more social with other bronies. But im certainly not gonna use facebook for it
<prince-dari> I only made a facebook a couple of months ago because one of my friends left my school.
<prince-dari> Prick.
<Rainbow-Dash> Ponychan I dont even understand
<MeteorVenture> i actually made my DA for less honorable reasons to begin with.. and i hope that isn't basically permanently in my account history lol
<Fluttershy`> 08,1facebook is overrated
<Fluttershy`> 08,1>>
<Apokalipse> I use this place to be social with bronies :p
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Skype is much better
<Apokalipse> I have like... 5 people added on Skype
<Apokalipse> only 2 of those actually use it
<MeteorVenture> once i know that i might actually use my DA account eventually
<Rainbow-Dash> I havent even downloaded Skype yet
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I use it because I have to actually lol
<MeteorVenture> i only really use skype for my brothers
<Apokalipse> I use it to talk to a Malaysian and sometimes a brit
<Apokalipse> true story
<Apokalipse> :p
<prince-dari> I don't ever actually friend request people on facebook, they can request me if they want to be on my list.
<MeteorVenture> dari i know what you're thinking.. but you're still gonna have to friend me first
<prince-dari> MeteorVenture: Wut?
<MeteorVenture> i'm just joking around
<MeteorVenture> :P
*Fluttershy` throws a muffin at MeteorVenture's head
<prince-dari> I dun geddit.
<Dashite> Dari, he's playing hard to get.
<MeteorVenture> *eats it*
<Fluttershy`> 08,1>>

<Fluttershy`> 08,1>>
<prince-dari> Orlynao?
<Fluttershy`> 08,1yes
<Fluttershy`> 08,1it's been a problem for a few days
<MeteorVenture> the thing is if you add me that means that you're the one that wanted to be my friend:P it's a joke about power struggles and pride
<Fluttershy`> 08,1ever since you set us to +v
<prince-dari> Ok, fixed.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1hmmm
<Fluttershy`> 08,1time to try then
<Apokalipse> I just noticed that it would then be impossible for me and dari to befriend ourselves on facebook
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Okay it works ^^
<prince-dari> Haha, we're the same in that sense then?
<Apokalipse> Sort of. I'm not on facebook long enough to actually search for someone and befriend him
<Fluttershy`> 08,1lol sorry MeteorVenture <3 thanks for being my test subject
<Apokalipse> If I ever go on facebook I wonder what I'm doing there and go somewhere else.
<prince-dari> >invited to part next Saturday
<MeteorVenture> your little test costed me much mental anguish.. huh.. i just realized how anguish looks kinda like angus.. and now i'm thinking about burgers
<prince-dari> >don't know the person who's house it is
<prince-dari> O_o
<prince-dari> party*
*Fluttershy` dances
<prince-dari> whose*
<Apokalipse> Are you going to attend?
<prince-dari> Not sure.
<prince-dari> If some people I know are going, yeah, I suppose.
<prince-dari> Though to be fair I've had a good time at parties when I didn't know anyone there.
<prince-dari> Was a bit awkward to start with however. XD
<MeteorVenture> fluttershy your little kick made me thing about burgers.. i hope you're happy.. i'm gonna be fat and it's all your fault
<MeteorVenture> it's just logical tbh
*Fluttershy` 8enjoy her good old-fashioned meal of biscuits and gravy. She looks up, blinking innocent, mouth full, "Huufmm mmm?"
<Fluttershy`> 08,1enjoys, inoccently* > >)

<MeteorVenture> remove curse reminds me sooo much of exile
<MeteorVenture> anyway...
<Fluttershy`> 08,1biscuits with a sausage gravy is teh bomb~
*MeteorVenture says nothing and just stares
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ohay people

<Fluttershy`> 08,1>> looks... boring to me lol
<MeteorVenture> no one knows my childhood favorites D:
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Thanks <3 I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
<Fluttershy`> 08,1kk
<prince-dari> Comment on that youtube video: "It's cool to see how Spiderweb Software's games have evolved and how some features﻿ remain the same."
<prince-dari> SPIDER'S WEB!
<prince-dari> Best film ^
<Fluttershy`> 08,1o-O
<Fluttershy`> 08,1huh?
<Fluttershy`> 08,1by the way
<Fluttershy`> 08,1the other day when I asked what was so bad about Babes in Toyland... why did nobody tell me /why/ it was so bad?
<MeteorVenture> lol btw more recently spiderweb software finally got a game on steam :D
<herospirit> Ich bin hier
<MeteorVenture> avadon
<Apokalipse> I need to watch babes in toyland still
<Apokalipse> I herd it's on youtube
<MeteorVenture> babes = babies? or women? or some other third thing?
<herospirit> Make sure you watch the live action version thingy,
<herospirit> It's the bad one.
<MeteorVenture> or pigs?
<Fluttershy`> 08,1MeteorVenture lol
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I don't think they mean 'pigs'
<Apokalipse> Which one was streamed here?
<herospirit> I haven't a clue, Venture. I watched the movie, and I have no clue what the "Babes" reffered to.
<herospirit> One second, Apokalipse
<MeteorVenture> but i have to say.. exile has one of the best storylines ever lol
<herospirit> I don't know if the other version is live action or cartoon
<MeteorVenture> alright thanks hero lol
<herospirit> Oh, I think they're both live action
<herospirit> But it's the 1986 version.
<Apokalipse> Should I watch it?
<Diftraku> http://mihaaaa.deviantart.com/art/Donny-S-216160201
<herospirit> It matters Apokalipse; how much self torture can you endure?
<Apokalipse> Oh, it's that bad is it?
<herospirit> Eeyup.
<Apokalipse> I'll watch it. Not right now though
<herospirit> The sheer horribleness put at least two of our members into a fit of depression.
<herospirit> :I
<herospirit> It's not the funny kind of bad, it's the "Oh god is this ever going to end" kind of bad.
<Apokalipse> Do I need to watch it all?
<herospirit> I wouldn't. Not again. :P
<MeteorVenture> oh btw fluttershy.. exile is basically an old open-world RPG that actually felt pretty huge and the storyline was epic.. it's not boring! it's just old
<MeteorVenture> just old :(
<EspyLacopa> How well has it aged?
<MeteorVenture> lol well it probably doesn't run well on newer computers.. it's been remade already to keep up with newer computers (so it's not unstable or just not working) and it's about to be remade again soon
<Diftraku> http://fyre-flye.deviantart.com/art/Tee-hee-260220180
<Diftraku> http://fyre-flye.deviantart.com/art/Brooding-260222587
<MeteorVenture> and he's changing a few things like the skills and traits and such.. the storyline is staying the same though.. anyway i would LOVE to see a new game that's like that old game
<herospirit> >mfw Diftraku chose the same time as me to lurk on Lauren's DA profile
<Diftraku> :P
<MeteorVenture> cause in new games i can't attack friendly people and have towns hate me.. i can't do that and actually break the game.. it was fun to do stuff that could totally ruin the game if you were to save it afterwards.. so you just make a few save files
<Diftraku> Correction: dAWatch
<MeteorVenture> like killing a very important character.. otherwise though you could actually kill said character to progress instead of doing their quest for instance.. but who knows what that means a bit down the storyline
<MeteorVenture> but you generally knew not to just kill people lol.. they never revive ever
<MrChang> greetings from the future, everypony
<herospirit> Greetings from the present
<MeteorVenture> but there was an editor to bring important chars back to life or give you certain key items or something if you screwed everything up somehow
<MeteorVenture> >mfw i read that as broodling
<herospirit> Bahaha. This amuses me, I never noticed this before.

<MeteorVenture> free willy is a B movie
<Apokalipse> The boss is a perv. Great. This movie started off swell
<herospirit> Oh gog you're really watching Babes in Toyland alone/

<MeteorVenture> eh..
<herospirit> Rainbow Dash refuses to pee on the fire.
<Apokalipse> No! Stop SINGING! AHHHH
<herospirit> Who here has courage and a full bladder?
<Apokalipse> NO MAKE IT STOP
<MeteorVenture> well not sure if i should but if you want to we could watch it in a synchtube.. but we would have to start over lol
<Apokalipse> I have no idea what synchtube is
<MeteorVenture> or i would have to catch up while you wait a few mins
<herospirit> Meteor, you'd really watch Babes in Toyland just to support Apokalipse?
<MeteorVenture> as long as it's not a very nasty movie
<herospirit> What a friend.
<Apokalipse> But I'm okay with taking a break already
<herospirit> Lol, it's a childrens movie.
<Apokalipse> They started singing
<herospirit> childrens' movie*
<MeteorVenture> lol alright then ya.. i'm interested
<herospirit> I'm still not sure what they mean by "Babes"
<MeteorVenture> babby's in toyland
<Apokalipse> I'm on the second part 45th second by the way
<herospirit> How many definitions of "Babes" are there? Maybe one will fit.
<herospirit> THEY ARE WEAK LIKE LITTLE BABBY
<MeteorVenture> well.. starting

<MeteorVenture> speaking of which.. i can't wait for another MLP song
<AllisZero> Ahh, I have chinese almost every day

<MeteorVenture> the girl is wearing mario's clothes
<Apokalipse> hero, do they sing a lot in this movie?
<herospirit> Yes Apokalipse.
<herospirit> All the time.
<Apokalipse> God... damn... it
<Apokalipse> I hate crappy singing
<herospirit> The singing. It gets worse. BUWAHAHAHA
<MeteorVenture> apparently i love crappy singing cause i love the CMC theme
<Apokalipse> I suggest we start watching the second part together MeteorVenture

<Apokalipse> Meteorrr how far into the first part are you?
<herospirit> It's like
<herospirit> no matter what ethnicity you are
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's probably the least offensive thing I've seen on Youtube!
<MeteorVenture> done with it now
<herospirit> that commercial has something to offend you,

<Apokalipse> Oh yeah, we could also do that

<RobotPinkie> 06,15I wish that were a real commercial, that would be so awesome
<herospirit> I know right?
<Apokalipse> Are you going to create the room?
<AllisZero> Is that a real commercial?
<AllisZero> No, Chuck Testa
<MeteorVenture> alright just a sec
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's a comedy skit, I imagine, not real, what with the channel it's on and the things at the end. :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's still awesome, though
<herospirit> God, Twilight's hair was DIFFICULT to sprite, but...
<herospirit> Rarity's hair is FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE
<MeteorVenture> i'm just gonna hijack this http://www.synchtube.com/r/FlankBook
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh wow, I can imagine
<herospirit> I'm just going to like. Work on her hair a little bit at a time.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So Synchtube is working again?
<herospirit> I'll probably finish a dozen more ponies while working on her hair :P
<MeteorVenture> you in there?
<MeteorVenture> apokalipse
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yep it is, nice. Wasn't able to use my Synchtube room this weekend
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Probably overloaded by all the bronies :P
<MeteorVenture> apok you in there?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, watching Babes in Toyland I guess :P
<Rainbow-Dash> RobotPinkie, I demand you come and share in our suffering
<Rainbow-Dash> In my synchtube room
<herospirit> I think RP already saw it
<Rainbow-Dash> I know
<Rainbow-Dash> He has to suffer with me
<Rainbow-Dash> Lol
<herospirit> You'd have to be either incredibly brave or absolutely insane to watch it twice.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I was kinda disconnected from the room... it's not loading now
<RobotPinkie> 06,15oh, now it's back
<herospirit> Man
<Rainbow-Dash> Feel free to come and bask in the glow of whatever it is MeteorVenture is making me play http://www.synchtube.com/r/JWLS
<herospirit> Looking back on the musical "Gepetto" I used to watch as a kid
<herospirit> Sad Drew Carry is like a sad puppy. :I
<AllisZero> Damn, know those involuntary movements you sometimes get on your eyelids?
<AllisZero> Anyone have that problem?
<herospirit> Yarp.
<AllisZero> I've had it on my left eye for like two weeks now
<AllisZero> Just cooonstantly
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's weird... maybe you should have it looked at?
<herospirit> MeteorVenture
<herospirit> I thought you might want to know of something I just learned in a PM
<herospirit> "<Rainbow-Dash>: So you know what Chunkatuff is making me watch?"
<herospirit> "<Rainbow-Dash>: I have it muted. XD"
<Rainbow-Dash> Its legit
<herospirit> CHEAAAAAAATIIIIINNNNNNGGGGGG
<herospirit> NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha
*herospirit does the tattle-tale dance
*herospirit just invented the tattle-tale dance
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Come save us, Luna!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF PONIES!
<Rainbow-Dash> http://kp-shadowsquirrel.deviantart.com/art/Sunshyne-260327508
<herospirit> Lol, I just googled "Lyra MlP FiM" and got this
<herospirit> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lnrkr2Q18v1qjmjvko1_400.jpg
*herospirit is amused
<AllisZero> Hahaha
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, oh wow
<AllisZero> What's the story behind Lyra having hands, sitting like a person etc?
<herospirit> I really like the exasperated Bon-Bon
<RobotPinkie> 06,15She sits like a person on the show, which got it started
<herospirit> AllisZero; it spawned from the bronies noticing she sits like a-
<herospirit> DAMNIT RP
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Ohay Val
<ValtheJean> 2,14 howdy robot
<herospirit> YOU NINJAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<AllisZero> Ah, gotcha ahaha
<ValtheJean> 2,14 no stream? Does that mean I'm in time for House? :D
*RobotPinkie ninja-kicks herospirit with a large trout
<Apokalipse> You can watch babes in toyland with us
<AllisZero> Yeah Val
<Apokalipse> on synchtube
<herospirit> ......
<herospirit> http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmxfgx2hVN1qjotd2o1_500.jpg
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, House is in 20 minutes or so
<Rainbow-Dash> Herospirit, if you thought me muting it was cheating
<herospirit> Wat
<Rainbow-Dash> Im not even watching it now
<ValtheJean> 2,14 apokalipse...may you burn in the seven hells for your heresy
<Apokalipse> tYou can still catch the last 8 parts
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Nah, House starts soon Apokalipse :P
<AllisZero> Yaranaika
<herospirit> ....I just noticed how cool Lyra's mane style is.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think Lyra is a pretty cool pony
<Apokalipse> Especially as seapony lyra
<RobotPinkie> 06,15She's no Harpo, though...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I don't know why, but I find seapony lyra amazingly adorable
<Apokalipse> Yes I do too
<RobotPinkie> 06,15She's irresistible
<ValtheJean> 2,14 maybe because the Lyre implies a Greek mythology, which then can go back into Mermaids luring sailors to their deaths
<Apokalipse> And she's watching you clop clop clop
<RobotPinkie> 06,15>mfw apparently I can't spell irresistible, according to my spell checker
<ValtheJean> 2,14 so seapony lyra just sits on the rock beds playing her lyre, luring aimless sailor ponies to the depths
<AllisZero> http://a0.img.mobypicture.com/e0947525312fc08b7b20428e1fc12c87_view.jpg
<AllisZero> NO GLEN, NO
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Giggity giggity
<RobotPinkie> 06,15She is watching him clop, so.... I'm not surprised.
<herospirit> Glen vs Lyra lurk off GOGO
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Alright, time for some Minecraft 1.9 until Luna gets here.

<DashWithRainbows> hey guys, is the countdown for the house episodes?
*LunaShy nods
<DashWithRainbows> well i made it just in time, my mom was fixing the laptop screen.
<Luna> 07,1i'm pretty sure I included music too?
<DashWithRainbows> yeah i can hear it...
<AllisZero> Your mom was fixing the laptop screen?
<AllisZero> By heavens
<DashWithRainbows> yes.
<DashWithRainbows> in the bottem right corner
<AllisZero> aw damn it
<DashWithRainbows> the screen snapped off the plastic frame
<Luna> 07,1oh no...
<DashWithRainbows> and you could see all the circuits inside
<Luna> 07,1how did that happen?
<DashWithRainbows> well long story short
<DashWithRainbows> when my brother picks up the laptop
<DashWithRainbows> he has his hand on the top of the screen and lifts it like so
<Luna> 07,1>.<
<DashWithRainbows> and i was blamed for it all....
<Luna> 07,1laptops have feelings too!
<AllisZero> Smart
<DashWithRainbows> but she done a very good job in repairing it
<ValtheJean> 2,14 mine doesn't
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's a soulless monster bent on seeing me in agony
<DashWithRainbows> my old computer was like that...
*Luna likes this song
<DashWithRainbows> got my friends katana and smashed it to pieces
<DashWithRainbows> was a very fun day
<herospirit> .......
<DashWithRainbows> hoping to do the same to my xbox
<herospirit> Instead of like
<herospirit> I dunno
<herospirit> Selling it? :0
<DashWithRainbows> after halo anniversary of course
<DashWithRainbows> its fucked
<DashWithRainbows> it red rings everytime you turn it on
<DashWithRainbows> only i know how to make it work again
<DashWithRainbows> and even so, its a temporary fix
<AllisZero> Whyy would you bring a Katana to something hard!
<DashWithRainbows> out of sheer boredom?
<DashWithRainbows> + it was a very old computer
<AllisZero> Katanas are sensitive, their blades get nicks and scratches so easily
<AllisZero> Oh I don't give a crap about the computer
<AllisZero> But poor blade!
<DashWithRainbows> the one my friend had (and sold) was very durable, and very well made
<DashWithRainbows> he is in current possesion of a particular katana that he brought for £125
<DashWithRainbows> by about december, its will be worth £500
<herospirit> :0
<DashWithRainbows> from which he buys more weaponry and sells off again
<AllisZero> Does he buy them at auction sites and the such?
<AllisZero> Looking for antiques?
<DashWithRainbows> he buys them from a weapons site
<DashWithRainbows> i thinks its swords and bows
<DashWithRainbows> i cant remember the URL
<Cassandra> HOUSE
<Luna> 07,1oui

<Luna> 07,1no lag here
<AllisZero> gotta be something with my location
<DashWithRainbows> most likely...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's lagging for me as well, but it might just be my intarwebz
<AllisZero> or my firewall maybe
<Luna> 07,1Val just has fail nets

<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh good, thanks
<AllisZero> Yeah, it's not the stream
<AllisZero> It's my stupid slow virtual machine
<AllisZero> the new streaming service takes cpu usage to 100
<Luna> 07,1autsj

<Apokalipse> Guys you lie
<MrChang> SO
<MrChang> what's new?
<Apokalipse> Babes in toyland wasn't worse than spiders web
<herospirit> Pants
<MrChang> ooo
<MrChang> i know a really bad movie
<MrChang> let's watch Dragonball Evolution
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, we respectfully disagree, Apokalipse :P
<Apokalipse> It was a movie... It was bad, but at least it was a movie
<Apokalipse> even IMDB agrees with me
<ValtheJean> 2,14 see, MrChang, that is a movie that is so bad it's hillarious
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Babes in Toyland was just bad, as in physically painfull
<MeteorVenture> lol well it wasn't all that bad imo.. it was probably about as good as something like free willy
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Now you're no longer alone, Luna! <3
<Luna> 07,1Hey!
<AllisZero> Shut your traphole
<Luna> 07,1I like free willy!
<AllisZero> Free Willy is great
*AllisZero brohoofs Luna
<ValtheJean> 2,14 luna is never alone
<Octavia> 13So ronery
<Apokalipse> You all overhyped babes in toyland for yourselves
<MeteorVenture> lol i really don't like that main kid
<herospirit> You know what we need to watch?
<Fluttershy`> 08,1I mean she's not alone in here anymore, lol.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah what's wrong with Free Willy?
<herospirit> Birdemic.
<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE5dJDgZ644
<Octavia> 13:P
<MeteorVenture> that main kid in free willy is a punk
<MeteorVenture> the MAIN KID
<Fluttershy`> 08,1Dum di dum di dum~
<herospirit> The guy who made Birdemic believes it's a masterpiece.
<FlaschenJoe11> evenin' bronies and Sisnies
<herospirit> :0
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It IS a masterpiece!
<MeteorVenture> the best part about it was.. michael jackson
<FlaschenJoe11> what are we watching?
<DashWithRainbows> house
<AllisZero> Know what we have to watch?
<Apokalipse> I can't wait for Yellow Submarine. I don't even know why I like that movie so much
<AllisZero> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwTiu3typeY
<MeteorVenture> i'm just saying.. be as cynical about free willy as you are about any other movie people say is bad and you'll see it
<FlaschenJoe11> free willy is a classic that I personally love,
<MeteorVenture> dunno if i used cynical right or not.. but i hope i got the point across
<FlaschenJoe11> because it's also so cheesy
<SomeBrony> This episode is… something.
<Luna> 07,1ohai Guys!
<Apokalipse> Free Willy isn't good exactly, but I don't think it's fair saying babes in toyland is on par with it
<Luna> 07,1and now we wait for our candidate
*FlaschenJoe11 is evil popcorn guy
<DashWithRainbows> @ AllisZero this looks pretty good for a foreign film, would like to see it
<AllisZero> I haven't watched the first one but want to
*Fluttershy` hugs Luna "Okay!"
<AllisZero> It's really good
<herospirit> I think we should schedule a Bronystate Bollywood Movie Marathon
<AllisZero> Hehe
<AllisZero> Alright, gonna go work on setting up a better wireless network
<MeteorVenture> lol well that was if you set the "goodness" bar on free willy slightly lower and on babes in toyland slightly higher
<herospirit> Bollywood makes the BEST worst movies.
<AllisZero> See you guys in a few
<MeteorVenture> they come close
<FlaschenJoe11> laters Allis
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Bollywood also makes the best BEST movies
<herospirit> :P
<Luna> 07,1Bollywood is awesome
<herospirit> See
<Luna> 07,1I loved Bunty & Babli
<DashWithRainbows> >does not watch many movies so i dont know what bollywood is
<herospirit> we DO need a Bronystate Bollywood Movie Marathon
<herospirit> A BBMM
<Randall1160> SHEEEET IM LATE
<Randall1160> HOW MUCH DID I MISS?
<FlaschenJoe11> I myself don'T really see the charm in Bollywood
<herospirit> It's like the Indian hollywood
<Luna> 07,1one ep
<MeteorVenture> idk what bollywood even is
<MeteorVenture> is it worth watching?
<herospirit> It's like the Indian hollywood.
<FlaschenJoe11> I get why people like it, but it's just not for me
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Oh lawd
<herospirit> They put out a lot of "So bad they're good" movies.
<herospirit> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svOlz2ei4Yk
<herospirit> Speaking of Bollywood...
<MeteorVenture> then i say we should watch the troll series
<Apokalipse> This is why we can't have nice things
<MeteorVenture> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyophYBP_w4
<herospirit> OOOOH MYYYY GOOOOOOOD
*Apokalipse does not want to watch the Troll series
<FlaschenJoe11> everyone and their mother know of this scene
<Randall1160> I love that scene
<MeteorVenture> but not everyone has seen that movie.. but their mothers have
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Can't watch movie trailers, House is on :P
<Randall1160> we should watch downfall later, the full things on youtube :D
<herospirit> :P
<FlaschenJoe11> it's like the german show Tatort. miss a scene and you have no idea what's going on
<herospirit> This is awesome.
<Apokalipse> Hey guys. I need the opinion of bronystate on something
<Apokalipse> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064091/
<FlaschenJoe11> we listen
<Apokalipse> Is that an A or B movie?
<herospirit> LOL
<Apokalipse> Because technically it falls into the A category if I go by the definition posted on the rules
<herospirit> HOUSE IS BAWS.
<Randall1160> Clever House
<Edward_Newgate> What a troll
<MeteorVenture> has anyone seen the story of riki-oh?
<Apokalipse> note to self: Never ask anything here during House
<MeteorVenture> i watched that.. i actually liked it alot even though i'm positive it's a B movie lol
<FlaschenJoe11> by production values of the time it looks like an A movie
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah it looks B to me
<Randall1160> who this new chick? (lolol)
<herospirit> I could never work for house.
<Randall1160> who is*
<Apokalipse> But like I said, the rules say A
<FlaschenJoe11> after all it's from 69
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's a 6.7 rating
<herospirit> I'd end up laughing at the things he does to dying people too often.
<Edward_Newgate> I would KILL to work for House
<Apokalipse> With all due respect IMDB isn't the best... the movie got nominated for a grammy
<Apokalipse> And from the people Ive asked that watched the movie they say it's good
<Randall1160> egbert is a hrash critic
<Randall1160> harsh*
<Edward_Newgate> Maybe I could catch him singing the blues, then my life would be complete
<Trollestia> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdyAoSXF9LU
<Apokalipse> Oh and Val. Babes in toyland has a 4.9 rating
<herospirit> SCIENTIFIC TORTURE
<Apokalipse> And you act like it's the devils work
<FlaschenJoe11> we could do a anit-/war movie special with that and another movie
<FlaschenJoe11> *anti
<Randall1160> PLATOON
<Randall1160> YEA BOI
<Apokalipse> How is that anti war?
<Randall1160> Becasue Sheen doesnt want to be there
*Trollestia still wants Full Metal Jacket.
<Trollestia> It's anti-war.
<Edward_Newgate> Seconds the Full Metal Jacket thing
<Apokalipse> Okay yeah, I guess it is actually
<Randall1160> any movie where theres a ton of tragedgy, blood, and no one wants to be there = anti war
<Randall1160> Ive heard people say Saving Private ryan is anti war
<Randall1160> which it sorta is ina way
<Apokalipse> Yeah it is anti war kind of. I just remembered :p
<FlaschenJoe11> anti war is practically any movie that shows the terror of war
<FlaschenJoe11> while in the war
<Randall1160> basically every war movie can be turned into anti war by careful analysis lol
<Apokalipse> Well that movie's storyline is basically that evil Nazis want to kill wounded, wounded get away because Tito was smart as hell
<Apokalipse> So it is anti war I guess
<Apokalipse> Hi Ghosties
<Ghosties> 04That was fast
<Randall1160> I hate when movies portray germans as evil people though, becasue they too were drafted and did not want to fight
<FlaschenJoe11> Ghosties is here!

<Polarfire> I like the fact that it brings 2 of my favorite things, movies and bronies together.
<MrChang> i hate when MLP has a season gap
<Randall1160> same
<FlaschenJoe11> is just a short one this time
<Luna> 07,1Anything else you like?
<Randall1160> the season split is going to kill me
<MeteorVenture> which would you rather? episodes split apart or seasons?
<Randall1160> I would like the full 20+ episode Season like last time C:, but I know thtas not possible this year
<MrChang> why not?
<Polarfire> Oh, the S2 live streams also... I like having 2 streams also for Europe and the U.S... back during the summer I would usually attend both.
<MrChang> there's gonna be another 26 ep.
<Randall1160> in 2013
<MrChang> duhh no?
<Luna> 07,1What is your availability for moderating?
<AllisZero> Season 2 is 24 episodes long
<FlaschenJoe11> if possible neither, but if I have to choose? between seasons
<Luna> 07,1poor girl..
<AllisZero> And season 3 has been hinted at various places
<Randall1160> Im pretty sure they said season to is going to be split over 2 years of 13 episodes each
<Randall1160> and then 3
<MrChang> when?
<Randall1160> not sure, I never saw the actual news, a friend told me, so Im not going ot bet on it
<Polarfire> Right now, Saturdays and weeknights only... After American football season is over (1st week of November) I can be available Fridays also.
<MrChang> exactly
<MrChang> its your friend
<MeteorVenture> no way.. i doubt that so hardcore i am practically opposed to the possibility of the idea of that notion
<MrChang> can you really trust your friend?
<Sumica> So it's lupis right?
<Randall1160> but he tis be a brony and active on EqD
<FlaschenJoe11> INSTANT DRAMA, JUST ADD DEATH
<Randall1160> lol?
<herospirit> oshit
<MrChang> just b/c he's active and a brony doesn't mean he's honest
<Sumica> Quick give her an mri
<Randall1160> lol hes my twin brother actually :P
<Randall1160> I should ask him for the link
<Randall1160> if there is one O_O
<MrChang> you can't say a friend then
<MrChang> just say your brother
<Randall1160> true true
<Luna> 07,1How will becoming a mod effect your time spent on Bronystate?
<Randall1160> lol house
<FlaschenJoe11> we need sidecharacter-themed episodes
<Polarfire> It will probably increase even more... I'm already on for at least an hour or so each evening.
<Randall1160> yesh
<MantisToboggan> i don't know
<herospirit> ...
<herospirit> Did
<MantisToboggan> it took me a while to even get used to the CMC
<Randall1160> INSTANT HOUSE EPIHANY
<Luna> 07,1Do you have any experience with moderating?
<herospirit> Did House SERIOUSLY get an epiphany from that?
<Randall1160> lol I belive so
<Polarfire> No
<Luna> 07,1What can you do that would set you apart from other applicants?
<Polarfire> No first hand experience, atleast...
<Luna> 07,1In other words what would you contribute to the team if we would hire you?
<MrChang> cut her open!
<Luna> 07,1As in ideas, thoughts, plans; try to think outside of the box. But don't forget to showcase your abilities
<AllisZero> oh god
<LunaTheForgotten> Hey guys,more house I see.Awesome.
<MrChang> what are they getting out?
<Luna> 07,1holy...
<MrChang> a worm?

<Randall1160> I fail at typoing lol
<Randall1160> JESUS
<Luna> 07,1correct
<MrChang> yay
<Polarfire> Well... The primary reason I applied was to help out streaming season 2. For extra abilities, I would take on whatever is needed to move Bronystate forward, whether its maintenance, handling applications, etc. I am not nearly as tech-savvy as some of the staff here, but I know what I'm doing. As far as what sets me apart, I have been here awhile, I know how bronystate works, what the rules are, etc.
<FlaschenJoe11> typoception
<MrChang> so who else wants to join us for D&P?
<MrChang> randall? luna?
<Luna> 07,12 more left

<Randall1160> Ooooo
<MrChang> SATANS GAME
<MrChang> your children whether you like it or not
<FlaschenJoe11> Mazes and Monsters is a far out game
<Polarfire> I would basically contribute whatever the team needs or wants me to contribute.
<DashOrCrash> Ponies and dungeons? why no dragons?
<MrChang> NEXT EP
<Fluttershy`> 08,1awww
<herospirit> Dragons?

<herospirit> PFFFFF

<MrChang> pfft
<herospirit> GEEZ
<MrChang> thats such a stupid idea
<DashOrCrash> god would.
<DashOrCrash> I would.
<DashOrCrash> dang double post

<herospirit> IS THAT I HAD
<MrChang> dawww
<herospirit> ...BONITIS
<MrChang> i thought he was gonna die
<Polarfire> I can't think of any specific abilities to tell about, are there any specific abilities you want to ask about? heh.
<Veewave> AWSOME! House is on.
<MrChang> savant?
<herospirit> That would have been an awfully early death for a House episode :P
<MrChang> he's autistic
<DashWithRainbows> ends up like CSI herospirit
<herospirit> :0
<Luna> 07,1Nope, we were just wondering. This is your chance to impress us
<RobotPinkie> 06,15>mfw no one recognizes Dave Matthews
<Fluttershy`> 08,1double negative
<Fluttershy`> 08,1means a yes
<Fluttershy`> 08,1lol
<herospirit> Hey, does anyone know if Lyra has any color swaps?

<herospirit> "you have a big tongue"
<Dermathil> HOUSE MD!!!!!!!!!!!
<Dermathil> HE'S BACK
<herospirit> ...I like this autistic guy.
<Randall1160> lol House
<MantisToboggan> ok this is the best thing i ever saw http://zeurel.deviantart.com/art/TF2-Flash-The-Question-260363255
<MantisToboggan> it's official
<MantisToboggan> everyone else can just stop trying right now
<Luna> 07,1yes he is
<MrChang> awesome
<Polarfire> Ah. Well, I have experience with IRC(I have my own server) and Linux (if it matters), I can stream S2 in HD, and I usually get along well with others... heh
<Veewave> MantisToboggan: love you!
<herospirit> .......
<herospirit> Mantis.
<Luna> 07,1What specific ideas do you have to improve Brony Movie Night and help increase viewership?
<herospirit> You are correct.
<Randall1160> Souldul duet initiated
<Randall1160> soulful*
<MrChang> then his fingers crack
<Randall1160> lol
*Dermathil_ pokes prince-dari
<prince-dari> What?
<Dermathil_> ohai
<herospirit> "my leg's not a piano..."
<FlaschenJoe11> That made so much sense, it's not even funny. Yet I still laugh!
<Polarfire> Well. As far as improvements go...
<Randall1160> lol so true
<DashWithRainbows> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz2hsvByNno
<herospirit> "I'd like it to be a piano"
<MrChang> i wanna learn to play a piano
<DashWithRainbows> i think this is really good Fanimation
<herospirit> I can play piano well, but I have trouble reading the music fast enough to do it. :I
<Randall1160> same
<Randall1160> I usually have to memorize the stuff well enough to play it
<herospirit> Yah, same here.
<herospirit> Which means it takes forever to learn a song XD
<Randall1160> very true
<FlaschenJoe11> younger house looks awesome
<herospirit> Younger House looks pissed.
<Polarfire> I would set up more regular weekly streams, like House and Dr. Who. They help bring in more viewers for the regular movie nights, along with bringing bronies with even more common interests together. Also, maybe advertise a little. And for the S2 streams (I know it would be expensive) a dedicated streaming server would probably be a big improvement. The problem is setting up something that can handl
<Polarfire> e 2000 SD, maybe even HD viewers.
<MrChang> younger house only looks 10 years younger
<Randall1160> true dat
<MrChang> they didnt get a old enough picture from hugh laurie lol
<herospirit> Younger house looks like House... but /younger/.
*Apokalipse is trying to get a non brony to watch house on bronystate
<Apokalipse> Will I succeed?
<Ghosties> 04WHOA
<Ghosties> 04HOLY SHIT
<Luna> 07,1Any other ideas?
<Ghosties> 04Is that
<Dermathil_> hey Ghosties!
<Crono_Flash> GO FOR IT!
<Dermathil_> AND YES!!!
<MrChang> every little thing
<Ghosties> 04*Red* Foreman, and Dave Matthews?
<MrChang> is gonna be alright
<RobotPinkie> 06,15YES!
<Ghosties> 04Dude...
<Ghosties> 04So what's the story?
*RobotPinkie glomps Ghosties
<Polarfire> That's all that I can think of at the moment.
<Crono_Flash> He's also the Grim Reaper's Father
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Finally someone recognizes him
*Ghosties tries to fling Robot off...but can't -_-
<MrChang> how come house never does surgery?
<Ghosties> 04He weighs a *ton*
<Ghosties> 04GETIT
<Luna> 07,1Why do you want to be a BMN moderator?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Piano savant gets brain problems, is the story, basically
<RobotPinkie> 06,15or some neurological problems anyway...
<Ghosties> 04What is Red's character?
<Ghosties> 04Is Dave Red's son in this ep?
<MrChang> house almost gets his leg cut off
<MrChang> and now he has brain cancer
<MrChang> just can't catch a damn break, can he?
<MeteorVenture> was who framed roger rabbit ever streamed?
<Ghosties> 04No, Meteor
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I don't know, actually, have only been half watching :/
<MeteorVenture> alright thanks
<Ghosties> 04Then you're USELESS! >:O
<Polarfire> I think I am level-headed enough to make good judgement calls where needed... But the primary reason I applied for the mod position was in conjunction with the streaming. I would love to have my own weeknight stream.
<herospirit> ...Would that be A, or would it be B as a cult classic?
*RobotPinkie slaps Ghosties with a robotic trout
<Ghosties> 04Bitch, I'm transparent and formless
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Not when I'm looking away!
<DashWithRainbows> someone call ghost busters!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I've played enough Mario 64 to know this
<Apokalipse> That means you can't actually do anything to anyone Ghosties :p
*Veewave makes Ghosties think inside the box
*RobotPinkie is wondering how he managed to glomp Ghosties earlier
<Randall1160> lol
<Veewave> da magiks
<Ghosties> 04I have magical powerz
<Ghosties> 04I'm like a deus ex machina

<LunaTheForgotten> I play violin.
<Apokalipse> I play guitar

*DashWithRainbows plays no instrument what so ever
<Randall1160> I used to play violin
<Randall1160> I still play piano
<LunaTheForgotten> Although,my brother can play anything he picks up.
<DashWithRainbows> so... he can play a stick?
*Veewave is a Frenchhorn player (likes to play Star Wars music)

<DashWithRainbows> mayonaisse is an instrument...
<Lolipop_of_Doom> Woah
<herospirit> DashWithRainbows

<Veewave> DashWithRainbows: it isn't a BRASS instrument.
<Randall1160> Oo Coolio

<herospirit> what is this I don't even
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm almost finished playing Splinter Cell 1
<WhatPayne> Haha. I'll keep bringing that up every once and a while
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Such an awesome game.
<WhatPayne> To remind you
<ArcherJoe11> VISION!
<Diftraku> trolololololo
<Randall1160> FLASHBACK
<MrChang> INCEPTION
<Randall1160> BWOOOM
<WhatPayne> Yes it is. I just love those games, and not because Michael Ironside
<Lolipop_of_Doom> PONYCEPTION
<Randall1160> I think im going to like this episode
<ArcherJoe11> You are never too young to have a Vietnam Flashback
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah they're legitimately good games.
<Randall1160> DAYUM RIGHT
<ValtheJean> 2,14 and then House was a Psychic
<Randall1160> nam some stuff up
<WhatPayne> Those games are pretty interesting as they are really good, but no-one ever really talks about them
<Randall1160> Ive always liked splinter cell
*Ghosties doesn't have the patience to play the original Splinter Cell
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, people talk about them when they then say "but I like MGS better"
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Completely different games, though
<Ghosties> 04...but I like MGS better
<Ghosties> 04Actually
<Ghosties> 04I LOVE MGS
<Randall1160> y
<WhatPayne> Indeed. Not really that comparable
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I love MGS too, but it's not really the same type of game...
<WhatPayne> MGS games are more movie akin
<Ghosties> 04True, they're different
<WhatPayne> SC is the case of it own
<ArcherJoe11> I like stealth games, even though I ALWAYS GET SEEN IMMEDIATLY!!!
<Ghosties> 04It's somewhat hard to be stealthy in Deus Ex
<Luna> 07,1After this: FLUTTERCEPTION!
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yay!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 until you get the invisibility augment :P
*LunaTheForgotten sucks at being stealthy.
*Veewave crawls through the entire game
<Ghosties> 04Depends on the Deus Ex
<Trollestia> http://cheezfailbooking.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/funny-facebook-fails-c-c-c-c-c-choo-choo.jpg
*LunaTheForgotten shoots at random people in games.
<herospirit> LOL TROLLESTIA
<Ghosties> 04It's fairly simple in both the original and in Human Revolution, but I work better in HR
<herospirit> Epic trolling
*ArcherJoe11 loves the Cardboard Box
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The whole light bulb shooting thing can't be done in the original Splinter Cell, either.... PS2 version was so much easier
<Ghosties> 04Whereas in the original, I'm not that great
<Trollestia> Cardboard Box is best disguise.
<WhatPayne> You can shoot lights in SC1 on the PC
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I mean it can be done, but people will notice much more quickly.
<Veewave> Trollestia: omg
<Ghosties> 04What Trollestia said
<Trollestia> I love that image.
<ArcherJoe11> I need to pick up MGS 3 sometime
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, I know WhatPayne, I mean it's much harder to do in the PC/Xbox version.
<WhatPayne> Oh right. I've only ever played the PC versions
<RobotPinkie> 06,15MGS2+3 HD versions are coming out soon on 360 and PS3, btw...
<Trollestia> Do want.
<WhatPayne> Oh don't get me excited again
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, don't play the PS2 version if you've played it on PC, with any of the SC games :P
<ArcherJoe11> Awesome if you have a gamestore in the city that even has Final Fantasy VII between collector Items
<RobotPinkie> 06,15They are ridiculously easy
<Ghosties> 04Coming out on PS3
<Ghosties> 04Only
<Ghosties> 04Here in the US
<WhatPayne> Cant wait to play the Peace Walker and MGS3 again
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Really, Ghosties? :O
<Ghosties> 04Unless Hideo said otherwise, but MGS collection was Sony only last time I checked
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That's not cool.
<Trollestia> CQC is best martial art
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Wait, so only the Silent Hill HD collection is multiplatform?
<Ghosties> 04Silent Hill collection was also only going to be Sony only until a mass petition convinced Konami otherwise. Now it's coming to 360 as well
<prince-dari> WOAH
<prince-dari> A petition that actually worked?
<Ghosties> 04Yep
<prince-dari> Le gasp
<Ghosties> 04I know, right
<ArcherJoe11> should I buy Silent Hill 2?
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<Ghosties> 04Yes
<ArcherJoe11> I always wanted to play one
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I think ghosties is trying to tell you to buy it
<WhatPayne> Is there Silent Hill 1 in that collection?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15So close to kicking you, Ghosties :P
<Ghosties> 04Get Silent Hill 2. If you're a fan of horror, GET IT
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lolol
<prince-dari> Was the petition instigated by fans, or some official force?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, SIlent Hill 2 is AMAZING
<Ghosties> 04I think fans
<WhatPayne> I already have SH 1 & 2
<prince-dari> Wow.
<WhatPayne> I mean 2 & 3
<WhatPayne> Never played first one
<LunaTheForgotten> I've never played any Silent Hill games.
<prince-dari> Colour me impressed. :P
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Silent Hill 3 is also great, btw
<ArcherJoe11> well lucky me there's a shop with the old SH2 extended with Maria chapter
<Ghosties> 04Yes, Silent Hill 3 is also amazing
<Ghosties> 04Not as good as SH2 IMO, but still great
<WhatPayne> Which is why I asked is the SH 1 in that HD collection?
<Ghosties> 04No, it's not
<ArcherJoe11> should I get SH2 normal or extended?
<Ghosties> 04It's just SH2 and 3
<Ghosties> 04Extended
<Trollestia> Metal Gear>Silent Hill, imo
<Ghosties> 04Extended is vanilla SH2 with extra stuff
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, they have no plans for making any HD versions of PSX titles, unfortunately
*ArcherJoe11 is obviously trolling
<MrChang> lol @foreman
<AllisZero> Oh wow eff this, 6 PM

<CosmicChan> xD
*RobotPinkie brohoofs Flaria
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Wind Waker and Ocarina of Time are my favorite Zelda games.
<EspyLacopa> Link to the Past for me.
<CosmicChan> i got OOT3d, links awakening and twilight princess on my list
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I kind of shift back and forth which one I prefer. The bosses in Wind Waker are pretty much the best bosses evar, though.
<MoonDasher> gotcha
*MoonDasher sneds EspyLoops to the past
<MoonDasher> there ya go. have fun^^ and dont change anything important!
<MoonDasher> Oh, btw this is lordCelestia

<CosmicChan> y u change name?
<MoonDasher> reasons
<MoonDasher> im on other chats
<CosmicChan> tho i do love your new name
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I've played through most of Twilight Princess, but regrettably I haven't finished it :(
<MoonDasher> thanks.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I really want the Gamecube version
<MoonDasher> i have a picture of myself too
<CosmicChan> im still at the part before the temple in the sky
<MoonDasher> http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/269/e/b/profile_picture_by_theitalianstallion99-d4b0r7y.png
<EspyLacopa> I did rather enjoy Twilight Princess though.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I played about two hours of twilight, got bored/frustrated and never went back
<CosmicChan> LOVE that oc pony
<CosmicChan> and yea tp is a long one
<MoonDasher> thanks
<MoonDasher> OC?
<EspyLacopa> Fun though
<CosmicChan> original content
<MoonDasher> ooh haha
<MoonDasher> thanks
*ValtheJean didn't enjoy anything about TP
<CosmicChan> aww val y u like that
<MoonDasher> his mark is a crescent moon with a lightning bolt in it
<CosmicChan> ;P
<MoonDasher> :D
<CosmicChan> =D
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Do you like any of the Zelda games, Val?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it just doesn't hold up to OoT
<CosmicChan> i dont compare the 2
<ValtheJean> 2,14 um. I absolutely LOVE OoT and Majoras
<CosmicChan> i look at each game sepretly
<ValtheJean> 2,14 Link's Awakening was also really good
<CosmicChan> OMG I FORGOT MAJORAS MASK ON MY LIST
<ValtheJean> 2,14 yeah, and TP has serious control issues that frustrated me :P
<CosmicChan> THAT IS THE BEST GAME IN THE SERIES
<CosmicChan> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, what I played of Twilight Princess definitely wasn't on par with OoT or WW
<Flaria> LA was awesome.
<FreezeFrame> I found Twilight Princess to control fine
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Still quite good though
<FreezeFrame> If you don't like the Wii controls, get the GC version
*ValtheJean doesn't have a GC
<CosmicChan> zelda just impresses me with every game
<MoonDasher> Wii can play GC games
<Dermathil> FreezeFrame: or, just plug a GC controller in the wii
<MoonDasher> obviously haah
<FreezeFrame> ValtheJean: Wii is fully backwards-compatible
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, Link's Awakening is probably the second best of the portable Zeldas
<ValtheJean> 2,14 blug...so now I have to buy the game again, AND a GC controller?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 fuck that shit
<CosmicChan> lol val
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it should have been good enough on the wii
<MoonDasher> haha
<CosmicChan> but it was good, i loved it
<CosmicChan> (tho nothing beats MM)
<EspyLacopa> See, that's why I didn't get rid of my gamecube controllers when I traded in my gamecube for the Wii.
<CosmicChan> i cant wait for skyward sword
<ValtheJean> 2,14 still, that game wasn't good enough for me to REbuy it AND get a controller
<Flutterguy> Hey all you sexy people.
<CosmicChan> hey val or any mod for that matter, how good of a network connecton do you need to stream during the week
<CosmicChan> i would volunteer to stream oncei get home from school
<ValtheJean> 2,14 good enough that you can stream things :P
<CosmicChan> id love that
<CosmicChan> and hi flutterguy!!!
<CosmicChan> =D
<Veewave> OoooOOOOooOooooo a Flutterguy approaches.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 well, you're welcome to fill out a streamer application
<Flutterguy> Streamers!
<CosmicChan> i dont think my network could handle those saturdays or friday nights :s but id love to help out during the week
<Flutterguy> Oh wait, wrong streamers :P
<Nittany_Discord> I wonder if someone is recording MAD.
<CosmicChan> val, could you direct me to this application?
<CosmicChan> =3
<ValtheJean> 2,14 just send an email to bronystate@gmail.com and ask for one ;)
<CosmicChan> gotcha, thanks val =D
<ValtheJean> 2,14 you're welcome
<Veewave> When my desktop is fixxed I could probably stream on Saturday's.(Probably won't be anytime soon though)
<CosmicChan> i defenatly want to stream tho =p
<Veewave> I'll tell y'all if it ever finishes
<CosmicChan> =3
<CosmicChan> awwh i have to go eat now =c
<RobotPinkie> 06,15You don't stream directly to the viewers, your network load will be pretty much constant.
<CosmicChan> ok
<CosmicChan> i really do want to stream
<CosmicChan> but ill be back in a bit guys
*CosmicChan is afk
*Veewave seems to end up eating chicken very often
<Flutterguy> Chicken is good.
<Veewave> I think so too
<Veewave> .
<FreezeFrame> I love how Babes in Toyland was the first TOO PAINFUL movie.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 technically spider's web was
<Flutterguy> I didn't get to see Babes in Toyland, so I guess I was spared.
<Veewave> DON'T SPEAK THAT NAME
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but we figured it wouldn't happen again :P
<FreezeFrame> I like watching it at Christmas
<EspyLacopa> So, who suggested Babes in Toyland?
<ValtheJean> 2,14 I don't know
*Veewave AFK's in anger
<ValtheJean> 2,14 but if he shows his face...there's going to be some trident usage
<EspyLacopa> And just think: What you all watched was the second of three remakes that were done of the original movie, which itself was an adaptation of the original playwrite.
*ValtheJean reaches for his trident
*Veewave reads Espy's words then pukes
<Veewave> How horrible!
<EspyLacopa> And the first remake was a Disney film.
<EspyLacopa> The third was a cartoon.
<Veewave> Mr.Rage-quit.jpg
<Flutterguy> YOU ARE TEARING ME APART LISA!
*Veewave slaps Flutterguy around a bit with a large trout
<Flutterguy> Ow what was that for?
*Veewave slaps Flutterguy around a bit with a large trout
*Flutterguy retaliates by slapping Veewave with a giant catfish.
*Flaria hugs Flutterguy so Veewave can't hit him
<Veewave> To help you pull yourself together... IT'S SO ON!!!
<Flutterguy> *squee*
*Veewave slaps Flutterguy around a bit with a large trout
*Flutterguy slaps Veewave with a giant catfish again.
*Flutterguy 5 damage.
*Veewave slaps Flutterguy around a bit with a large trout
*Flutterguy has fainted.
*Veewave has fainted.
*RobotPinkie hasn't
<Flutterguy> Then what happens? o.o
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Pretty sure that means I win.
*RobotPinkie fries up the trout and eats it
<Veewave> Flaria = judge of that!
<Flutterguy> Then you loot us while we're unconscious and bury the bodies in the woods?
<Flaria> o-o;
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Nah, I'm not that mean. I do like fish, though.
<Flaria> Well, Flutterguy fainted first... so Vee would win, but he also fainted....
<Flutterguy> Bleh, I don't like fish.
<Flaria> Robot would win, but he wasn't even in the fish battle. :l
<Flaria> DRAW
<RobotPinkie> 06,15The only winning move is not to play!
<Flutterguy> :[
*Veewave brohoofs Flutterguy
<Flutterguy> Well played friend, well played.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15lol no one getting that reference...
<Veewave> I remember
<MoonDasher> youve been trolled
<Flutterguy> It's vague to me.
*Flaria hugs RobotPinkie. "I got it!"
<Flutterguy> Oh yeah!
<MoonDasher> i got it
<Flutterguy> I remember now.
*Veewave is all up in dat reference
<RobotPinkie> 06,15It's an old movie now, I guess.
*RobotPinkie puts on his pony playlist in VLC
<Flutterguy> You know, I never really saw that movie, I just saw that one part.. :|
*Flaria has her mp3 player and headphones
<Flaria> RobotPinkie, War Games was the title, right?
*Flutterguy has his computer and new speaker system.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Yeah, it is, Flaria.
<Flaria> I should find that, I haven't seen it in a while.
*Veewave plays music with brain
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Good movie. Not the most awesome thing ever, but worth watching.
*Veewave "You see, you stimulate this node here and you get Rock, and this node gives you Techno..."
*Veewave "KILL THE PEGACORN!"
<Flutterguy> Too late, it left.
<Veewave> Aww,

<LordCelestia> not a grimdark fic
<ThePretender> supersad fic
<Flaria> Not Cupcakes grimdark, it's just... sad. REALLY sad.
<Flaria> uber-sad.
<Flutterguy> So.. I'll shed manly tears?
<Flaria> yes.
<LordCelestia> Aw.
<Flutterguy> Damn.
<Flaria> Go read it if you want to feel sad.
<LordCelestia> Not dinky doo....
<Lagmobile> Sadfic? Is it about Dinkys father?
<LordCelestia> :'(
<Flutterguy> I'm compelled to read it. But I don't want to feel sad.
<ThePretender> I didn't physically cry, but my inner self cried like a kid
<Flaria> There's an alternate ending to Bubbles, though.
<herospirit> Would it make me stab-myself-in-the-face levels of sad?
<LordCelestia> There's an alternate ending to every grimdark or sadfic out there
<ThePretender> Simply Rarity is one of the saddest things I've read
<Flaria> It's about Derpy as a filly and her parents.
<Lagmobile> Ive always wanted to know what happened to Dinkys father...
<Flaria> I have that downloaded.
<Flaria> I'm going to read that tonight, Pretender. :l
<Flaria> 30min~ GO
<Flutterguy> Confound these people, they compel me to read sadfics.
<Lagmobile> I dont know if i want to read it right now...
<Lagmobile> but i do want to read it sometime...
<LordCelestia> The CupCake chronicles goes deep into the investigation of RBD's attempted murder and shows RBD's cope with life without wings.
<ThePretender> it's prety short
<Dermathil_-> alright cyall.
<Lagmobile> I read part of tht
<ThePretender> later Dermathil_!

<Flaria> Pinkie dreams Cupcakes and Dashie calms her
<LordCelestia> omg that pinkie picture
<LordCelestia> funny ^^
<Lagmobile> only really sad when youve actually read cupcakes
<SuperBrony64> What's funny is that the Ponyville Cantina video was actually posted before the episode.
<LordCelestia> Ive read it
<LordCelestia> i think pinkies expression was funny
<Flutterz> g'night everypony!
<LordCelestia> the intent of the comic was probably humorous
<Flutterguy> Bye Flutterz!
<Lagmobile> even thouh i dint care about cupcakes that pic made me cry manly tears
<Lagmobile> Like a man
<LordCelestia> How?
<LordCelestia> It was humorous

<Lagmobile> Warning: its sucks :P
<Flutterguy> As soon as I saw Lucas, I thought Mother 3. :l
<herospirit> Lol.
<SuperBrony64> Lagmobile: Read it five times already.
<Lagmobile> really?
<SuperBrony64> Lol, no. *troll face*
<herospirit> :I
<SuperBrony64> But I'll give it a try right now.
<herospirit> :I
<SuperBrony64> If Google Chrome decides to work...
<herospirit> Everyone stare at SuperBrony
<herospirit> :I
<Lagmobile> No im just wondering why someone would read it that many times...
<Flutterguy> :|
<ThePretender> ...say whaaa?
<Lagmobile> lolwut?
<Lagmobile> did you leave or something?
<Flaria> :l
<ThePretender> had to step out for a bit because chat was acting up
<ThePretender> and now I am lost
<Lagmobile> ah
<FreezeFrame|Sleep> Yay! I'm gonna be 4-0 in my Fantasy Football league!
<SuperBrony64_> Oh boy, time for some random chaos...
<Lagmobile> well you didnt miss much
<Flutterguy> *drinks glass from chocolate milk*
<FreezeFrame|Sleep> I'm 3-0 this week, and my opponent next week.... calling him incompetent is generous
<SuperBrony64_> FreezeFrame|Sleep: How do you play Fantasy Football…?
<Lagmobile> Drinks the glass only
<herospirit> Looks like we're in for a big ol' storm of /CHAOS/...
<Lagmobile> *thrws away the milk which then explodes*
<SuperBrony64_> Do you use your imagination?
<Flutterguy> Do you get creative?
<Lagmobile> No i got creative
<Flutterguy> Lol
<SuperBrony64_> Green is not very creative...
<herospirit> HERRRDMIND
<Lagmobile> Oh god sorry...
<Flutterguy> Dude, Lag we think the same. Seriously.
<Lagmobile> I KNOW RIGHT
*Flutterguy brohoof
<herospirit> I was going to say it too, but I came in late. :[
<Lagmobile> Its kind of creepy
*Lagmobile hoof
<Lagmobile> Long lost twins?
<Flutterguy> I guess. But it's still pretty sweet.
<Flutterguy> Depends.
<DashiteAlt> This is annoying.
<Flutterguy> Do you believe inanimate objects that trip you are mocking you and you feel compelled to hit them and punish them?
<Lagmobile> Actually... sometimes
<Lagmobile> but yes
<Flutterguy> No way. I think that all the time.
<SuperBrony64> Lagmobile: Wha? That's not a story about ponies :P
<Lagmobile> OH DEAR LORD
<Flutterguy> I hit my shoulder on the door, I punch the door.
<Lagmobile> No its not about ponies
<Flutterguy> I trip on a chair, I kick the chair :l
<SuperBrony64> Flutterguy: It's not very effective...
<Lagmobile> i wrote it before ponies came into my life
<Flutterguy> Wrote what?
<herospirit> ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ
<SuperBrony64> Lagmobile: …I…I trusted you...
<Lagmobile> lol big mistake, right?
<Lagmobile> But sorry anyway
<SuperBrony64> It's okay, but I don't follow the story...
<herospirit> ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ
<Flutterguy> Green!
*Lagmobile hugs SuperBrony64
*Flaria is getting sad
<herospirit> Green is not a very ǝʌıʇɐǝɹɔ color
<Flaria> Darn you sadfic ;_____;
<Flutterguy> Why is Flaria getting sad?
<Flutterguy> Oh..
<Lagmobile> Oh god, lets not get creative please...
<SuperBrony64> Okay, I'm reading it seriously now...
<ThePretender> Simply Rarirty?
*Flutterguy hugs Flaria cause it's only a fic..
<herospirit> Why not get ǝʌıʇɐǝɹɔ?
<Lagmobile> Its not my best work SuperBrony64
<Flutterguy> Green's a creative color herospirit!
<herospirit> Not /very/ ǝʌıʇɐǝɹɔ.
<Lagmobile> even though its my only work...
<SuperBrony64> Lagmobile: You shared it with the class, now we all must read it.
<Lagmobile> Gah!
*Flaria hugs Flutterguy
<Lagmobile> well i wrote it at 2 am and i constantly kept making edits to it the next morning
*ThePretender pats Flaria on the shoulder.
<SuperBrony64> OMG, SCAR-Ls, in a Pokemon story?!
<Flutterguy> What's next, Orbital Friendship Cannon?
<Lagmobile> Supposed to take place on human earth
<Flutterguy> ...that'd be nice :)
<Lagmobile> everything is more realistic
<Flutterguy> Wait, you wrote that fic?
<Lagmobile> yeah...
<Lagmobile> Did it suck?
<SuperBrony64> Flutterguy: Yeah, that's why the username associated with it is the same as his name here :P
<Flutterguy> Haven't read it.
<Lagmobile> it sucked didnt it?
<Flutterguy> I'm reading another fic at the moment..
<herospirit> Was it ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ?
<Lagmobile> Yeah it sucks...
<Lagmobile> Very creative hero...
<SuperBrony64> It's good, I like it.
<herospirit> Because I like ǝ ʌ ı ʇ ɐ ǝ ɹ ɔ things.
<herospirit> ...Okay that's enough creativity
<SuperBrony64> But it seems a bit confusing to me :/
<Lagmobile> Who wants to kno if the spirit o a hero can explode twice?
*Flaria sniffles and wipes a tear away
<ThePretender> awwwwwww
<Lagmobile> what happened to my keyboard...
<SuperBrony64> Oh I get it now, is it supposed to be Pokemon that come to our planet but are very hostile?
<Flutterguy> Flaria, what fic was it you were reading?
<Lagmobile> No, they evolved like normal animals and lie along side humans
<Lagmobile> I have an anthropological, historical and scientific explination
<SuperBrony64> Okay, it's good, but the biggest problem with it is that besides the mention of Pokemon, I don't see much Pokemon lol
<Lagmobile> its an intro, second chapter you meet the team
<Lagmobile> But the second chapter sucks...
<Lagmobile> I REALLY want to re write it...
<Lagmobile> But i really want to finish chapter 3... then along came ponies...
<SuperBrony64> Then go ahead and rewrite it.
<SuperBrony64> That would be a bit random :P
<Flaria> Flutterguy: Simply Rarity.
*Flaria wipes more tears away
<Flutterz> Well, looks like I won't be sleeping tonight
<ThePretender> what part are you up to?
*Flutterguy hugs Flaria
<herospirit> Night everyone
<Flutterz> I just read Cupcakes... Q_Q
<SuperBrony64> But this wouldn't fit in much with Ponies. At least wouldn't fit in as a good story by my tastes.
<Flutterguy> Bye herospirit
<Lagmobile> Im kinda juggling between finishing chapter 3, rewriting chapter 2 and watching ponies
<Lagmobile> night hero
<SuperBrony64> Flutterz: Welcome to the club
<SuperBrony64> Night herospirit
<herospirit> May your dreams be filled with Pony!
<Flutterz> thanks... I guess
<Flutterguy> Flutterz, I'm sorry you read it.
<Flutterz> So am I
<Lagmobile> Its a terrible filthy club filled with hate and remorse
<SuperBrony64> I believe it's a good story.
<herospirit> Also Flaria no more sad.
<herospirit> NIGHT
<Shadowmane> Flaria...
<Shadowmane> why did you have to remind me of that fanfic
<ThePretender> later herospirit
*Shadowmane now has a 'Simply Rarity' sad
<Flutterz> The story itself is rather well-written
<SuperBrony64> The content is certainly disturbing, but the writer does a lot of work in making the reader feel every emotion as the story unfolds.
<Flutterz> It accomplishes everything it tries to
<Lagmobile> brb
<Flutterz> SuperBrony64, exactly
<SuperBrony64> Which, is certainly the most important aspect of any story IMO
<Flutterz> true
<SuperBrony64> If there is enough sensory details, I could care less about the plot :P
*Flaria is done
<Flutterz> well, I'm gonna go TRY to get some sleep -_-
<Flutterz> night everypony
<Lagmobile> back
<Flutterguy> Bye Flutterz!
<Lagmobile> what i miss? :P
<SuperBrony64> Later Flutterz
<Lagmobile> oh

<ThePretender> larwe Flutterz
<Lagmobile> night flutter
*Flaria hugs #bronystate
*Flaria hugs Flutterz
*Flutterz hugs everypony
<Flaria> Sleep well, everyone.
<Lagmobile> Flaria is leving too?
<SuperBrony64> Night Flaria
<Lagmobile> Night then
<Flutterguy> Bye Flaria
*Flaria finishes wiping away the tears and disappears in a burst of fire
*Flutterguy hugs Flaria
<SuperBrony64> :(
<ThePretender> bye Flaria
*Flaria hugs Flutterguy
*ThePretender hugs FLaria
<Lagmobile> What is Flaria roleplaying as again?
<Flutterguy> Fire mage.

<ThePretender> I don;t
<Flutterguy> Nope.
<Flutterguy> I don't.
<Lagmobile> OK then

<Lagmobile> oh
<FlutterBro13> also adding fart randomly into it
<Flutterguy> Except for the first one.. which should be song.
<Lagmobile> no that one is supposed to be fail
<FlutterBro13> makes it even more annoying
<FlutterBro13> It is made to be a annoying song
<SuperBrony64> Lol -> http://browse.deviantart.com/?q=cupcakes%20pony&order=9&offset=48#/d3cdwcw
<Lagmobile> this didnt turn out the way you expected it to did you flutrerbro?

<MrChang> damn
<Lagmobile> Oh god the megamix is freaking awsome...
<herospirit> House eys.
<MrChang> cuddy got a 20 on a revive check
<herospirit> eyes*
<Lagmobile> my ears are bleeding rainbows...
<Stonegaze> House is a real sweetheart.
<MrChang> chase likes cameron
<MrChang> OOOoOoooo
<herospirit> Cutty can't math
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Cuddy needs to experience those other 9.9 times, seriously.
<Lagmobile> ignoring house right now... ponies...
<ValtheJean> 2,14 lol
<Flaria> Lagmobile has the right idea
<fluttercry> I...don't think i like this show
<CriticKitten> xD
<Flaria> By Celestia, that MEGAMIX <3
<MrChang> is nobody interested in the stream?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I'm sure her argument would be exactly the same :P
<MrChang> House is one of the best shows ever
<Dumori> but House guys
<CriticKitten> House is amusing to me, possibly because the nasty attitude he's got is hilarious when you're not the victim of it.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 watching House is like watching Live Action Ponies
<Lagmobile> But ponies, Dumori
<Dumori> I pony most of the day
<fluttercry> I prefer Doctor Who. Much better doctor
<MrChang> screw ponies, they can wait
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's so epic it's beyond description
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, I can't argue against ponies, but I love House. There's always time for ponies after.
<MrChang> NEXT EP RIGHT MEOW
<Dumori> RobotPinkie exactly
<ValtheJean> 2,14 House is synonymous with ponies to me :P
<Dumori> lol
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, that and Doctor Who, pretty much, Val :P
<CriticKitten> They both bring joy to my life, so yes. :D
<MoonDasher> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk_MhVURLks&feature=feedrec_grec_index
<ValtheJean> 2,14 eeyup :P
<MoonDasher> Watch it ^
<MrChang> wait
<ValtheJean> 2,14 ponies are the reason I've seen the two shows in the first place :P
<MrChang> i've seen fran before!
<MrChang> I KNOW
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, I'd seen a bit of House, but now I've seen a ton more.
<MrChang> it's kevin heffernan's mom!
<herospirit> I'm still drawing the COLE TRAIN riding Pinkie Pie
<MrChang> from king of queens
<herospirit> I'm doing this.
<herospirit> I'm making this happen.
<CriticKitten> o.o
<Lagmobile> ITS COLE TRAIN BEYBEH!
<fluttercry> The King of Queens was a good show
<Luna> 07,1kitty!
<MrChang> wait
<herospirit> Though I'm still on the Pinkie Pie part.
<MrChang> is she a ho?
<MrChang> she has a dick!
<CriticKitten> Yes.
<CriticKitten> That outfit is okay.
<MrChang> or a lesbian
<Flaria> Wait, what.
<herospirit> I've been working on Pinkie Pie for the entire last episode. :0
<Flaria> SHE'S FALLEN AND SHE CAN'T GET UP
<MrChang> wow!
<MrChang> she's taking the money
<CriticKitten> Shake the unconscious woman. Smart.
<Rainbow-Dash> All senior citizens need Life Alert
<Flaria> What a who- Ohhhh.
<MrChang> why are you robbing a poor old lesbian?
<Flaria> I see what they did there
<Rainbow-Dash> Herospirit, you are spriting?
<herospirit> Nah
<herospirit> Drawing right now
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Friends with benefits
<CriticKitten> lolgetit, friend.
<ValtheJean> 2,14 that poor cat has seen things it can never unsee
<MrChang> so wait
<MrChang> this lady is a lesbian?
<CriticKitten> Oshit
<MoonDasher> GUYS, this video is wonderfully edited

<CriticKitten> Well at least she's honest.

*Flaria huggles streamer
<Diftraku> WTB Scootaloo chaos clip :3

<CriticKitten> House is trolling Cutty so hard.
<WhatPayne> What is Diftraku?
<Lagmobile> Problem, Cuddy?
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Whoever said this is a good episode is right... though ALL House episodes are good.
*Lagmobile house.jpg
<WhatPayne> I did RobotPinkie.
<Diftraku> WhatPayne: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDCDyQBFsF8
<prince-dari> Everything has bad episodes. :P
<Dumori> x3
<WhatPayne> And you are right. All House eps are good
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Well, maybe in later seasons it turns bad, I wouldn't know
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Most shows eventually run out of ideas
<Luna> 07,1we'll see :)
<Lagmobile> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l76thgtOaKA&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL
<RobotPinkie> 06,15And for that I'm grateful, Luna <3

<Lagmobile> inb4 celing cat
<Luna> 07,1oh dear..
<WhatPayne> Not gonna spoil but this is really good
<Dumori> ...
<Lagmobile> House is psychic
<RobotPinkie> 06,15That seems bad...
<Lagmobile> or a mentalist
<CriticKitten> I like this episode.
<CriticKitten> So much.
<Lagmobile> or a doctor...
<DSD> 2Hey Dari
<MrChang> lol
<prince-dari> Hey.
<MrChang> he's making the white kid be chase
<CriticKitten> xD
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, oh wow, he's simulating his team perfectly :P
<herospirit> That... that was amazing.
<Lagmobile> Is that the indian dude from Bones?
<CriticKitten> HA
<RobotPinkie> 06,15Haha, way to not cause panic :P
<Diftraku> :P
<Lagmobile> mass panic...
<MrChang> now if only House said bomb
<RobotPinkie> 06,15He might do that... just for a giggle.
<Lagmobile> Its not out of his character...
<MrChang> "Ladies and Gentlemen, while you're vomitting, I'd like to inform all of you that there's in fact a bomb onboard the plane."
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's always cancer with him :P
<Luna> 07,1that's his job..
<MrChang> that girl needs to shut up
<Lagmobile> inb4 lupus
<Lagmobile> even though im usually the one who thinks its lupus...
<CriticKitten> ....
<Dumori> it's not lupus
<prince-dari> IT'S NEVER LUPUS
<Dumori> it is some times
<RobotPinkie> 06,15I think it's blowfish poisoning, because that sounds delicious
<Dumori> x3
*Lagmobile Celestia - Mellow dramatic.wmv
<CriticKitten> "I know how to ask if his sister's over 18 but I don't think it's gonna help." That may be the best line he's spoken yet.
<RobotPinkie> 06,15House knows every language in the world, he just doesn't like showing off.
<Luna> 07,1cause she took your money!
<MrChang> the ho starts to like her in the end!
<ValtheJean> 2,14 dat skank!
<Lagmobile> What are you talking about h LOVES ahowing off

<Dumori> dun dun dun
<MrChang> cuddy has it too
<herospirit> And then everypony died
<Lagmobile> Dat zombie plot...
<prince-dari> You're allowed to say wank during day time TV on America...? O_o
<Lagmobile> its not a swear in the us
<ValtheJean> 2,14 it's because americans are simpletons and laugh at silly British words, even when they don't know what it actually means
<Lagmobile> in england however...
<prince-dari> Lawl.
<Revolver> I know what wank means
<Dumori> lol
<Dumori> also wank off is a term for a person
<Lagmobile> Twat isnt a swear in north america as well
<Dumori> really
<Dumori> Twat is rather strong
<prince-dari> Well twat isn't really a swear here either.
<Dumori> it depends how north your are Dari

<SuperBrony64> I see my magic is working
*ThePretender waves his new found hooves at SuperBrony.
<SuperBrony64> Who's this 'SuperBrony' fella? Remember, it's 1864.
<ThePretender> ...touche
*Flaria trots over to the fireplace and lays down inside, on top of the fire
<ThePretender> also, quick, everypony, what sort of pony should I be?
<ThePretender> unicorn, pegasi or earth
<SuperBrony64> Flaria: GET OUT OF THE FIRE! THAT IS NOT FOR COMFORT!!
<ThePretender> OHGODSHE'SONFIRE
<Flaria> IT IS FOR ME.
<SuperBrony64> You should be earth.
<SuperBrony64> I'm the pegasus.
<Flaria> My name IS Flaria.
*ThePretender douses water on Flaria.
<SuperBrony64> There can be only one.
<Flaria> I'm Unicorn.
<Flaria> HEY!
*Flaria flares up, evaporating the water and restarting the fire
*ThePretender runs for it.
<Flaria> Why'd you do that?
<SuperBrony64> ThePretender: YOU JUST KILLED FLARIA?! WTF!!
<Flaria> I was just getting comfortable. :(
<ThePretender> b-b-but she was on fire! ;_;
<SuperBrony64> You can't restart the fire Flaria, you're dead.
<ThePretender> I"M SORRY, EVERYPONY ;_;
<SuperBrony64> You need to roll a 15 or higher in order to be reborn.
*SuperBrony64 rolls a 14
<SuperBrony64> Oh shoot…next turn maybe
<Flaria> I'm /not/ fire, I'm just a fire mage. :l
<SuperBrony64> QUIET YOU! You're dead.
<ThePretender> ...we need a seapony

<SuperBrony64> You know what, fine. Flaria, I've given you your lifepoints back as a DM FAVOR.
<SuperBrony64> You only get one and you just used it.
<Flaria> :l
<ThePretender> can I roll for some Mountain Dew?
<Flaria> The only DM I respond to is Chang.
<Flaria> And I never died.
<SuperBrony64> ThePretender: Yes you may. You need 7 or higher to successfully grab Mountain Dew.
*Flaria sniffs and turns away from SuperBrony64, walking back into the fireplace and snuggling the fire
*ThePretender rolls...and gets an 8! MOUNTAIN GET
<SuperBrony64> Well, let that be a lesson to you...
*AllisZero knows snuggling a fire can't possibly go well.
<ThePretender> *MOUNTAIN DEW GET
<SuperBrony64> AllisZero: YOU ARE NOT IN THIS SCENE!
*AllisZero not in the scene but still absolutely positively sure hugging a fire can't possibly go well
<SuperBrony64> You have to roll an 86 or higher in order to obtain a teleport spell that brings you to where we are.
<ThePretender> Does the dice even go that high?
*SuperBrony64 slaps ThePretender
<SuperBrony64> Don't defy me.
<AllisZero> @rollmeter
<ThePretender> Why? ;_;
<EspyLacopa> They can, if you're using percentile dice.
*ThePretender chugs his Mountain Dew is sadness.
<SuperBrony64> That doesn't work in this chat...

<AllisZero> Whelp, going to bed everypony

<SuperBrony64> Nittany_Discord: You're now the sheriff of this town.
*SuperBrony64 hands Nittany_Discord badge
<Dermathil> hey Nittany
<SuperBrony64> I must be seeing doubles...
<Nittany_Discord_> WTF my computer went into sleep mode.
<SuperBrony64> Okay, you know what.
<SuperBrony64> Everyone playing the game wins.
<ThePretender> YAY
<SuperBrony64> Flaria: You weren't much of a team player so you only get half the completion points.
*ThePretender does a victory dance
*Flaria sighs
<Flaria> What is this, Portal 2 Co-op?
<SuperBrony64> Sure. If that's what you imagine it to be.
<SuperBrony64> But remember
<SuperBrony64> It's 1864.
<ThePretender> I thought this was 2011?

<MoonDasher> to be ponies
<MoonDasher> and rename it
<MoonDasher> MAD MAD (pony name)
<Nittany_Discord_> That was lightning.
<Nittany_Discord> In fact, we just had a nice, close strike.
<SuperBrony64> Speaking of MAD
<SuperBrony64> http://youtu.be/_YYclpE16-c
<Nittany_Discord> I saw that on TV.
<ThePretender> so BroNYCon is trying to get famous people for the next one
<Nittany_Discord> Then the ThunderLOLcats segment had RD flying for a bit.
<SuperBrony64> They should get Lauren Faust
<SuperBrony64> It bothers me that they named the pony in that clip Applejack
<SuperBrony64> But that specific pony is awesome.
<SuperBrony64> Also, I like this song: http://youtu.be/bMgByEotGpM
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygI-2F8ApUM <-- toot!
<SuperBrony64> EspyLacopa: THAT'S NOT A PONY
<ThePretender> if they get Lauren Faust
<ThePretender> my mind would explode
<EspyLacopa> It's also the full song.
<SuperBrony64> They should get the guy who wrote Cupcakes on stage.
<ctrlx> haircut was a sucess
<SuperBrony64> ctrlx: Really now? Tell us the entire experience.
<ctrlx> i took the buzz cutters
<ctrlx> and took down the sides and back
<ctrlx> and did a small fade to the top
<ctrlx> then i shaved
<SuperBrony64> Interesting…go on.
<ctrlx> then i cleaned up
<SuperBrony64> …and then what?
<EspyLacopa> Know what we need? Pony Puppet Pals
<ctrlx> now i am here
<SuperBrony64> What we need are some CREATIVE puppets.
<ctrlx> EspyLacopa, i'm liking this idea
<SuperBrony64> Puppets that like thinking CREATIVELY
<ThePretender> ...no
<ThePretender> nooo
<ThePretender> NOOOOOOOO
*ThePretender dislikes creative things.

<ThePretender> ...why are you dancing on my head?
<ThePretender> unless! DISCOOOOOORD
<ctrlx> EspyLacopa, A for effort. doesn't exactly work though :(
<Xerion> Good
<Xerion> a bit bored
<EspyLacopa> Yea.

<ctrlx> it's a good song
<ctrlx> :O! my door is open!
*Xerion starts to /explode/
<ThePretender> but can you explode twice?
*Xerion starts expanding.
<SuperBrony64> The best part about the Soup Nazi? He really did exist.
<SuperBrony64> And was strict about his line in the very same way.
<ThePretender> XD
<SuperBrony64> But he had the best darn soup.
*Xerion explodes once....
*Xerion explodes twice!
<ThePretender> mmmm, Jambalaya
<SuperBrony64> Here's the real guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwXLQxIfPv8
<ThePretender> ...huh, guess you could explode twice
<Flaria> You probably wouldn't want to, though.
<Flaria> Unless you were a fire mage or something.
<ThePretender> but what if you were a fire mage with water on them?
<Flaria> Maybe a Voltorb with a focus sash so it can self-destruct twice?
<SuperBrony64> Xerion: You can't do that…you're not Fluttershy
*Flaria shrugs
<Flaria> Does that even work? I haven't played with Focus Sash much.
<EspyLacopa> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVS3eI0s2aA <-- FLUTTERQUEST
<Xerion> noes
<ThePretender> does it have yay spam?

<Flaria> ThePretender: I'm just in a TOOT kinda mood today.
