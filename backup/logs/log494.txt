<Magical_pablez94> Om: ?
<Om> Magical_pablez94: Hmm?
<Rain> a few more fuel tanks and triple liquid thrust should pull it off
<Rain> lawl
<Polydunami> Anyway, we're now in a serious mood, huh?
<Magical_pablez94> Om: "don't sleep too well?" ???
<sub06905> dat fuel

<diddutz> reach for the stars!
<YamaTHou> Its been a long since I last visit bronystae
<Phase4`> it just keeps going XD
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> they can see the crash site from there ?
<Rain> when you entirely run out of fuel, detach /everything/ and just let your cockpit float
<Polydunami> No, I came on here just as Nittany completed a successful mission
<CometSurge> YamaTHou: Hiiiii! WB!
<StupidSexyCJ> wb YamaTHou
*Magical_pablez94 looks ta Om , confused.
<Polydunami> Oh god

<Gunthler> I'd say this is the most successful launch yet.
<metalzeldabrony> lol dat secibd ba==naught
<Rain> because you have left orbit and are now doomed to drift away
*Spectrum_Rush|Plushy hurls
<Polydunami> You have no idea how far the sun is from the Earth
<metalzeldabrony> *dat second naught
<Vordox> Not for long... :P
<Dark_of_Max> 100.000.0 yay

<Rain> you dont XD
<dshannon> look up?
<AlejrandoMoist> you don't
<CupcakeWarrior> XD

<Polydunami> There are no pings this time
<TheRainbowDash> Sumica: That was literally, the greatest fail ever from you.:D
<diddutz> Dear princess celestia, today i learned a valuable lesson about rocket science ...
<GrimGallop> Meanwhile, my own ship is approaching an alititude of 800k
<Lil_B> Bananas http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/321/062/72e.png

<Polydunami> Umm
<Phase4`> ITS PERFECTLY SAFE
<Om> uh oh

<Vordox> DiDN'T DRop the rockets...fuu
<GrimGallop> Were those supposed to...?
<diddutz> explosion incoming

<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> oh this is bad
<Polydunami> That looks safe
<CupcakeWarrior> Wow sumi
<Ponies47> I'm not gonna say it
<CometSurge> Best rocket ever!
<Rain> my god, its going to work
<Vordox> That was cool...
<Om> Weeel
<diddutz> oh it actually worked 0.o
<TheRainbowDash> Woah, that seperation was aweosme.
<Rain> you should have looked down to watch them fall
<Om> That worked poorly
<GrimGallop> I just hit 900k
<Polydunami> It actually works U__U
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> so thats 2 successful launches for Sumica ,one for nittany
<Inquisitor> I have no idea what I'm watching right now
<Ponies47> (squee) IT!
<TheRainbowDash> And yay for me who can't spell in the morning.:D
<GrimGallop> Still going ~800 meters/sec
<StupidSexyCJ> Inquisitor: Science
<Rain> dat smoke trail looking like a bottle rocket
<Om> Suddenly. The spanish Inquisition
<Vordox> It LOOKED AWeSOME so..meh :P
<Inquisitor> no body expects it...
<Pinkies4thWall> :O
<Phase4`> Om: No one expects the spanish inquisition
<Phase4`> Sumica: XD
<Rain> when fuel runs out, separate EVERYTHING!
<dshannon> moar?
<Phase4`> Sumica: you forgot the seperators
<Vordox> Rain: SEPERATE ALL THE ROCKETS! :D
<Om> Guess not.
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> Phase4: but everybrony expects the spanish equisition
<dshannon> it was about 55k?
<Polydunami> I can see Luna and Lyra
<Rain> Sumica add more liquid fuel and you can go farther
<dshannon> ya
<Polydunami> Barely
<JRP2234[MUSIC]> then booooom
<Pinkies4thWall> the right one is stoned
<Vordox> Why use these kind of rockets? There's actually a better way to lift things into the space
<OneTrickPony> 105
<Vordox> Use the god damn non gravity force way, cheaper, easier, safer. BAH
<Rain> speed up time! :D
<diddutz> you loose momentum...
<Inquisitor> some poor rube's gonna have his house flattened by the falling space debris... nice going @Sumica...
<Dark_of_Max> 100.000.0 !!!!!
<Om> You should call the space sea ponies.
<Vordox> AAAAND
<Pinkies4thWall> he's in space now
<OneTrickPony> wow
<Phase4`> 150000 i think
<Vordox> Not enouh for 150k XD
<dshannon> and now it goes down
<Phase4`> Sumica: nope
<Rain> detach that explosive crap!
<TheRainbowDash> Uh-oh...:S
<Phase4`> they are just 3 to 1 adaptors
<TheRainbowDash> That crash landing, prepare for impact!
<Inquisitor> I'd be worried if I could spin in reentry like that
<Phase4`> i think he's got enough
<Vordox> HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT
<Om> *snap*
<Inquisitor> stupid 'chute why wont you open?!?!
<Vordox> erm...

<HiImSpike> need to be as big as possibrule
<Polydunami> http://www.pbfcomics.com/94/ What the hell just happened?
<richfiles> Shouldn't fins jut out between the frame near the bottom?
<ponibas> are you sure?
<HiImSpike> more aero dinamic
<pony_4133> I was just about to say the same
<Polydunami> Whoa
<ponibas> wtf
<ponibas> it's working
<Ponies47> :o
<Inquisitor> why do you need to worry about aerodynamics in space?
<HiImSpike> Luna will be sohappy
<Rain> the one on the right is not liking this at all XD
<Vordox> Inquisitor: Looks good? :P
<Rain> NICE timing
<CupcakeWarrior> Hi RaveBrony
<RaveBrony> Good morning everypony! :)
<pony_4133> O.O

<HiImSpike> we are watching space shuttles fall
<ponibas> double tap the space bar =p
<Rain> very very nice timing Sumica
<TrixieBaconMuffin> CupcakeWarrior: Rocketman ...duh!
<Phase4`> oh wow, this one will go far
*RaveBrony hugs CupcakeWarrior, HiImSpike, Ninjazz, Ponies47, Polydunami, and OneTrickPony :$
<xmasskills> try and not crash this time
<Inquisitor> because they're all dead from g-force
<Rain> with the correct timing like that, I think you could add another fuel tank to the mix :D
<HiImSpike> thanks RaveBrony
<Ponies47> Hugs RaveBrony back :)
<CupcakeWarrior> He might make it to Luna
<Phase4`> Sumica: if you start aiming now, i think you could make it to the moon
<RaveBrony> What is on stream? :o
<Polydunami> This is Kebler Space Program
<Polydunami> By Sumica
<Rain> left guy is shitting his pants
<Inquisitor> inverted !

<Rain> Sumica, why are you ruining your best launch yet? D:
<Inquisitor> timey wimey
<Polydunami> The one on the left
<ClutterShy> wibbly wobbly timey wimey
<HiImSpike> success
<Inquisitor> stuff
<richfiles> Best launch... Just no sense of direction at the destination! :$
<Polydunami> He doesn't seem to be enjoying the ride
<Rain> detach before you are dragged down
<Rain> lol
<ClutterShy> doctor whooves
<Om> Even though he almost beat it anyway
<richfiles> 5th stage
<Om> MOAR!
<Polydunami> Shooting the moon again, are we?
<HiImSpike> can the shuttle go bigger
<Polydunami> Wait
<richfiles> Yay! :(
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> yuss
<HiImSpike> yay
<Rain> oh god XD
<Polydunami> What?
<OneTrickPony> great idea
<GrimGallop> Yes.
<Stardust_Phoenix> can you go 10?
<Dark_of_Max> lol
<ClutterShy> yay
<HiImSpike> make is massive
<Inquisitor> forego any safety apparatus... make the thing nothing but fuel and fire
<ClutterShy> :(
<HiImSpike> yeah
<Rain> XD
<TrixieBaconMuffin> "Go..go for the moon..hey now you're a rockstar, put a show on , get laid, and all that glitters is gold , only shootin stars break the moooold!"
<Rain> inb4 you totally need more gimble
<Phase4`> i cant purchace a copy of this game because the store bugs out
<GrimGallop> Is the ship larger than the launch pad yet?
<Inquisitor> put more thingies and the doohickies
<richfiles> Suspend 3 more in the middle with struts
<ClutterShy> one of these days Alice. To the moon!
<Rain> lawl
<HiImSpike> I like the sound of that
<HiImSpike> risk equals fun:$
<Spell-of-Gaming> I found a english Nico Nico Douga website. It's official. :3
<richfiles> Make middle rockets
<Rain> lawl
<Polydunami> Say what?
<Stardust_Phoenix> its the sports car of rockets
<HiImSpike> very efficent
<Onyxia> ;o hi
<Onyxia> whats this?
<richfiles> Cap'n must be tiiiiiiiny! :D
<Rain> lets watch as it goes boom
<diddutz> Sumica: with an additional layer of them power thruster things you can might change your highest power thrusters to liquid fuel thrusters which help you one you left atmo
<Stardust_Phoenix> needs nos
<Polydunami> Hello there Onyxia, this is Kebler Space Program by Sumica :3
<HiImSpike> holli jamoli
<Inquisitor> Pyramid of death... oh, it's the apallo 7
<GrimGallop> Good an evil are subjective.
<Rain> TOTALLY NEEDED THE GIMBLE!
<Polydunami> You might get at least one more meter out of this
<Phase4`> Sumica: the important thing is that it works
<CrazyCherry|MC> Friendship!
<Ponies47> :O
<HiImSpike> I think the wieght of the rocket may tip it alittle
<Phase4`> this one is going to get soo much height
<CometSurge> :O
<Inquisitor> true test of this game would be to bring a precice low orbit tactical strike somewhere on the other side of the planet
<TrixieBaconMuffin> did he reach first cosmicvelocityyet ?
<HiImSpike> not if it goes upsidedowny
<Rain> turn it upwards so we can watch
<richfiles> Agreed
<RaveBrony> O.o
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> i see wobbly
<Rain> as the stuff falls
<Pwah> uh oh
<Om> You need maor long ones!
<AlejrandoMoist> Sumica, try to get orbit as well
<Phase4`> Sumica: thats not a bad idea actualy
<Rain> speed up time! :D
<richfiles> I see little moon
<Inquisitor> lets do the time warp again?
<HiImSpike> ooh my muffins 6_9
<richfiles> or maybe it's just a star
<diddutz> 1 liquid fuel tank empty 2 to go ;)
<Rain> WOO
<RaveBrony> Gogogo :D
<richfiles> To the moon!
<Rain> To the far reaches of starvation because we wont be able to get back!
<CometSurge> GO APPLEJACK GO
<Polydunami> Shoot the moon! Get all the hearts!

<AlejrandoMoist> Sumica, look at the earth
<Polydunami> That is nuts
<Stardust_Phoenix> To equestira
<TrixieBaconMuffin> now deploysolar sails and get crew into cryo , on to Alpha centauri
<RaveBrony> I have to play cards again.. its been awhile
<Phase4`> Sumica: i recon you could add another fule tank and start the liquid stage with the last solid stage
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> YAY Sumica
<CometSurge> SUCCESS
<Rain> 100 k !
<Inquisitor> AUGH!
<TheRainbowDash> Absolute success.:)

<Rain> 103k
<Phase4`> parachute should break
<Phase4`> wow, atmosphere slows the craft a lot
<Polydunami> That was a thud
<HiImSpike> safe
*Spectrum_Rush|Plushy claps
<CometSurge> SUCCESS

<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica: You connected stuff to thursters
<derpy_pony> oh...missed the best part
<Rain> too heavy? XD
<derpy_pony> what happened?
<HiImSpike> try it again

<Lil_B> ClutterShy badabbadabbdabba dee ba da badda bo
<alexxm> that can't be good
<derpy_pony> it will leave a nice crater

<Very_Silly_Filly> You're running on crappy liquid, and you're going fastest than you did with fuel
<Very_Silly_Filly> I lol'd
<Rain> stream craps out right when "that cant be good"
<Inquisitor> it's ok, he can die 3 times and still have a heart attack
<Lil_B> look at this worls... no signs of Civilisation whatsoever...
<Lil_B> world*
<Malavolent> Who's streaming anyway?
<derpy_pony> the first stage destroyed the start ramp and killed 82 rocket scientists
<TheRainbowDash> derpy_pony: Wat.:D
<alexxm> Sumica is i think Malavolent
<Ponies47> I think Simica os having a little bit to much fun :$
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> dat laugh
<Inquisitor> Psh... Lil_B you don't need civilization to have a space program....
<Rain> of course not, they are all dying because they are testing out their rockets
<Very_Silly_Filly> mine had a mechenical failure as I was about to land on the moon
<Ponies47> *is
<Very_Silly_Filly> My parachute wouldn't come out
<derpy_pony> it fell off in less than 2000 km height....right over the start ramp
<Very_Silly_Filly> So I landed a bit rough and BOOM
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> its so noicey i feel like i'm watching a real launch here
<HiImSpike> little dude on the left
<Lambo> He already is in space
<Lil_B> Sumica just will never know what goes wrong :/
<Lambo> This is way too much
<HiImSpike> :D
<ClutterShy> skadoosh
<derpy_pony> he forgot to use the toilet before start
<Ponies47> Bronystate the website I go on everyday and spend any spare time here :P
<Om> Woooooow
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica, I think you can rest now
<Arentius> he looks so terrifed

<Evil_Spike> It is awesome
<Lil_B> Malavolent bring Weathley back for Portal 3
<HiImSpike> man your ears would on fire going this high
<Malavolent> alexxm: Seems legit.
<Very_Silly_Filly> And the guy in the middle, I forget his name, it takes a disaster of doom to make him even start to go dafuq?
<Inquisitor> damn you gimbles!!!
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> oh dis is bad
<HiImSpike> toooooooooooooooo tha moon
<Malavolent> Let's find Luna.
<richfiles> what's the arc?
<Om> You need moar rockets :[
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lets do the time warp agaaaaaiiiin!
<Phase4`> Sumica: theres a button to show your orbital path
<HiImSpike> wooow
<Ponies47> Lil_B: *Feals sleepy* MUST STAY AWAKE FOR AWESOMNESS!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica: It says K
<Lil_B> these 3 pilots look like... their Jimmies are getting rustled
<Phase4`> dat rollover
<Evil_Spike> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuZPkKpQJ0c&feature=player_embedded
<Inquisitor> he's still accellerating away from the planet...
<Phase4`> bye earth
<ponibas> m
<Very_Silly_Filly> You went so much, it's gone into Km rather than m
<GlutenFreeJenkins> G'day, everypony.
<derpy_pony> buck rogers
<Ponies47> Hey GlutenFreeJenkins :)
<Malavolent> Aaaaand we're going down.
<TheRainbowDash> Hello GlutenFreeJenkins!
<Inquisitor> his orbit's not decayed yet
<richfiles> pause and find the orbit trajectory
<Phase4`> 2.783 MILLION METERS
<Lil_B> owww... Gravity is an asshole...
<Rain> WOO! Go Sumica!
<Very_Silly_Filly> Land in England
<Gunthler> dat lul
<derpy_pony> now they fall back
<ponibas> :P
<Phase4`> there it is
<TheRainbowDash> Ooo, a map.
<derpy_pony> lol
*GlutenFreeJenkins hugs Ponies47 and TheRainbowDash
<TheRainbowDash> Never seen this before.:)
<HiImSpike> cool if equestria was a alien world
<derpy_pony> they will die horribly
<Lil_B> 2783 Kilometers :O
<Ponies47> Hugs GlutenFreeJenkins :)
<Very_Silly_Filly> Parachuuuute
<Rain> fucking stream, I missed most of the flight because it lagged
<Inquisitor> took off from south america and lands in england..... seems so inefficiant to exceed orbit, not to even circumnavigate
<Very_Silly_Filly> Jammy bastard
<derpy_pony> no death? boooooo!
<GlutenFreeJenkins> :o
<HiImSpike> do you have the option to use the parachute
<TheRainbowDash> derpy_pony: Boo- RD:D
<Om> Rain: You missed the best one yet.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I wanna see the G
<derpy_pony> it doesnt open! yay!
<derpy_pony> crap
<Phase4`> i think.... that there is an mlp:fim movie in the works right now
<Very_Silly_Filly> Is that 34 g?
<Vordox> movie?
<Malavolent> Phase4: Please no.
<Phase4`> absolute conjecture, dont quote me. but i think there is
<Very_Silly_Filly> Is that all?
<derpy_pony> suddenly, sharks
<Evil_Spike> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Very_Silly_Filly> I was foing about 350 at one point
<Barrel_of_Fun> it would be a good way to make money, imo
<Ponies47> Phase4: WAIT WHAT!?! :O
<Phase4`> Malavolent: why not?
<Inquisitor> you can watch your grabbels crash and burn if you want HiImSpike, @Sumica's done it a couple times
<Phase4`> XD
<Lambo> Apply for Nasa
<Evil_Spike> Die?
<GlutenFreeJenkins> If it's going to be in cinemas, I'm going
<Malavolent> Phase4: Who is making it?
<Rain> oh lawd yes!
<Lambo> Become a space engineur
<Phase4`> MOAH G's
<HiImSpike> Phase4: you serious
<richfiles> Oh My! Luna shitting moonrocks, that's hardcore!
<HiImSpike> about the movie
<Evil_Spike> You sound like Littlepip
<Ponies47> ded
<Evil_Spike> At Richfiles
<Phase4`> ok, about the movie i mentioned before. I HAVE NO INFO, its a guess based of what i've seen coming out of hasbro
<Inquisitor> it's like I'm a real rocket scientists
<Rain> this can only go wrong XD
<diddutz> I got the feeling that wont even lift off groung :|
<derpy_pony> add more wings!
<Om> My god.
<derpy_pony> can never have enough wings
<Evil_Spike> MORE THRUSTERS!
<Phase4`> uh.....
<TheRainbowDash> Where is GilDash when you need that pony?
<richfiles> Seperators?
<Om> I doubt that will lift...
<Phase4`> Seperators?
<Ponies47> Phase4: *Squees*
<HiImSpike> I bet luna is laughing at us saying you will never reach me
<derpy_pony> this will end well
<Om> TheRainbowDash: On vacation.
<Rain> how is it going to drop off? XD
<Inquisitor> dredge the entire persian gulf for @Sumica's Space Program!!!
<Malavolent> Please MTV, pimp my space shuttle!
<TheRainbowDash> Om: I know, but it's been way too long now.
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> and connectors Sumica
<Inquisitor> Fund it!
<Om> TheRainbowDash: It comes back monday or tuseday
<Rain> liquid is too slow burning to get off the ground like that XD
<Phase4`> soo many stages
<derpy_pony> is there a moon in the game?
<richfiles> He always need that friendly reminder... We are happy to oblige! :)
<richfiles> Yes
<Lil_B> Phase4 I think a good Idea for MLP right know would be like a second show, but with more adult oriented writing and animation, while still keeping the original show around, so you can make even more money, without making X number of seasons for only one show
<Inquisitor> my life is like a fart....
<Phase4`> Lil_B: hmmmm
<Ponies47> Okie doki loki. Now I'm gonna go to bed. I hope. *Curls up into a ball* *Yawns* NIGHT NIGHT YA'LL
<HiImSpike> Hope next season has more luna
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica, clean the rocket and make it a tall pillar. Put a few thrusters on the side, about 6 on about 2-4 levels, then put some fuel cells around the top
<Ponies47> :)
<Malavolent> Lil_B: There are fanmade adult pony shows... if you know what I mean.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I did that and it worked well for me
<Lil_B> Phase and with adult oriented writing i don't mean Midlife crisis or other stupid RL TV-Show crap :/
<Phase4`> Lil_B: i'm not sure there would be enough of a market for that just yet
<Phase4`> but it is an interesting iead
<Ponies47> :'(
<Phase4`> idea'
<Inquisitor> ponies having a mid life crisis would be worth watching
<Evil_Spike> Good point
<Thorn> WHAT THE JESUS IS THAT
<HiImSpike> Phase4: tell us
<Phase4`> would LOVE to see it though
<Rain> this can only end badly
<Phase4`> HiImSpike: tell you what?
<HiImSpike> idea
<HiImSpike> ???
<Rain> liquid doesnt have enough thrust for this XD
<Phase4`> HiImSpike: i was correcting a typo
<richfiles> Can you suspend a triplet of motors from the center, rigged to the 1st stage by scaffolds?
<Lil_B> Phase4 I know, I mean just as an Idea, with more "advanced" animation
<Ponies47> VERY WELL THEN BE THAT WAY! No pony can't even say goodnight *Curls up into a ball and starts crying* :'(
<Inquisitor> @Sumica's only missing his Illudium Pew-36 Explosive Space Modulator
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Have you seen the recent EqD discussion about animation?
<HiImSpike> ooooow sorry :'( Phase4
<Thorn> What about nyan cat?
<richfiles> Needs more stage in the center
*Rain is calling it, this isnt getting off the ground without a fight
<HiImSpike> its going to blow up
<richfiles> Adding weight, but no additional rocket power
<Ponies47> I'm gonna say this one more time.... GOOD NIGHT EVERYPONY!
<HiImSpike> going with Rain on this one
<Lil_B> Malavolent only a little bit, because the first few posts made me think that the discussion is going in the wrong direction
<Phase4`> Lil_B: considering we had 10K viewers for the season finally on just this site, and the number of views the youtube copies have. plus the pagehits on eqd
<Inquisitor> nuclear fire is worth the work
<Malavolent> HiImSpike: It's going up anyway, isn't it?
<sub06905> not enough glitter :L
<Thorn> THEN MAKE IT BLOW UP NOW
<Phase4`> Lil_B: its not imposible
<Evil_Spike> That works too
<CometSurge> YOU'RE A MADMAN SHIZUKA :D
<sub06905> night Ponies47
<HiImSpike> maybe
<HiImSpike> night Ponies47
<Rain> oh god this wont end well XD
<richfiles> YAY!
<Malavolent> Lil_B: The discussion itself is not as important as that short clip of ponies animated in different style.
<Phase4`> night Ponies47
<Lil_B> Phase4 I know, also a show like this would make MLP even more excaptable + grant even more new viewers
<HiImSpike> poor little green guts
<Malavolent> Lil_B: I'd love to see more of it.
<sub06905> this can obly end it great success
<Dark_of_Max> 5:21 AM
<Rain> I hope it doesnt over heat D
<richfiles> Place them inside, I'd say
<Ninjazz> Dat Heavy Quote
<Very_Silly_Filly> If this lifts, I'll be amazed
<Inquisitor> next time eat a salad... ya dumb bib wearin dope
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Brb, coursework.
<Ponies47> TAHNK YOU! *Curls up into a ball next to Fluttershy* *Yawns*
<derpy_pony> streamers!
<Ponies47> *Thank
<Lil_B> Malavolent I have not seen it, sadly :/
<Rain> what sumica said XD
<Thorn> Needs moar derpy.
<richfiles> Moar pylons
<Phase4`> Lil_B: its dangerous teratory though, get the wrong writer and they'll just make a 'darker' mlp where things get killed and whatnot, completly missing the point
<Inquisitor> I dub this Design... @Sumica Challenger
<HiImSpike> it wont
<sub06905> needs moar fuel
<Capn_Gavn> are you just straight up building a tower into space
<richfiles> Challenger... Nothing could possibly go wrong.
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> sumi your rockets arent symetrical
<richfiles> Challumbia
<Phase4`> inb4 this somehow works
<Thorn> Sure.
<Rain> they are symetrical enough, damnit XD
<richfiles> Challumbiatanic
<Rain> go foar iet
<Inquisitor> in after we mourn the dead
<Thorn> JUST LAUNCH THE FUCKING THING.
<HiImSpike> try it try it
<Lil_B> Phase4 right, I don't wann see "Michael bays: MLP"... I mean, i would love to see really good action and everything, but no death and gore and sadness everywhere...
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> eh watev
<Very_Silly_Filly> What Thorn said
<Capn_Gavn> put boosters on the boosters
<Phase4`> The_Greener: watch your language
<Malavolent> Lil_B: http://derpy.me/OGFXd What do you think about it?
<Vordox> Is Bronystate going to marathon the mlp episodes before season 3 starts?
<diddutz> IT DIDNT COLLAPE!
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Holy. Crepe.

<derpy_pony> no worries, everything working as planned
<TheRainbowDash> Hahaha, that was funny as hay.:D
<richfiles> SRBs are probably too high to eject cleanly/
<Rain> XD
<Lambo> It's funny, because real astronauts died that way
<HiImSpike> see guys it was perfectally fine
<GlutenFreeJenkins> It was the best crash I've ever seen. :o
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> needs more conectors maybe/ Sumica
<GlutenFreeJenkins> ikr
<Very_Silly_Filly> I noticed that
<Thorn> Sweet jesus.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have eyes you know.
<Rain> one too many liquid tanks
<richfiles> That it did
<HiImSpike> more fuel
<Thorn> IT GOT OFF THE PAD
<Phase4`> Sumica: ikr
<Thorn> I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT AT ALL.
<Phase4`> amazing
<richfiles> And it flexed liek a freaking snake!
<ClutterShy> :[
<HiImSpike> BAZINGA
<Inquisitor> and regarding the faces on the dearly departed.... that's the way I'd want to die... on the best roller coaster ride EVER!!!!

<GlutenFreeJenkins> Dat royal canterlock
<GlutenFreeJenkins> #
<Thorn> HMM.
<Kandarihu> Inquisitor: last night before I went to sleep, it was Nittany_Discord playing this. So somewhere in the wee hours of the morning, Sumica decided to take over with the exact same game?
<Om> More=the answer
<Thorn> ITS NEARLY FUCKING COLLAPSING DUE TO WEIGHT.
<HiImSpike> it wasnt the rocket it was derpy driving it
<Ninjazz> Hey, Sumi! Turn on your pings! :D
<Thorn> Still room for more!
<richfiles> Just do 6 way symetry
<ClutterShy> my video has been stuck this entire time
<Phase4`> Thorn: less caps please
<Inquisitor> He's been playin it for a little while now Kandarihu
<Thorn> Sorry.
<Om> Ninjazz: Hey Ninjazz, apriciate ALL the ponies!
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Sucks for you, ClutterShy. :3

<GlutenFreeJenkins> Sh-yay-. :P
<CometSurge> GLORIOUS
<Rain> lol
<Inquisitor> the most amazing thing ever
<Lil_B> Malavolent that looks really good. I personaly thought more of the animation-stile of Teen-Titans or the new Ninja-Turtles Cartoon, but if done right, I think everything should be able to work
<Thorn> Kaboo
<HiImSpike> WOAH
<richfiles> HWOOOAH
<alexxm> i just don't know what went wrong
<ClutterShy> :[YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME! :(if thats fine with you

<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> :D
<richfiles> EDGE of stability
<derpy_pony> coool
<HiImSpike> bahahahahhaahhahaah:D
<TheRainbowDash> Sumica: You should play this game more often.
<Malavolent> Lil_B: That is possible, I'd like to see more anime style, it would look great in my opinion. But hey, it looks good the way it is now.
<Vordox> Sumica: Perhaps lower the volume of the game?
<Inquisitor> HA1
<Thorn> Yep.
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Rofl.
<HiImSpike> yay
<Lambo> Dude, be careful
<Dark_of_Max> yay
<Lambo> You are running out of Astronauts
<Inquisitor> the bottom rocket decided it wanted to be a drill
<Lighty> 06tyesh
<Very_Silly_Filly> Just put a tiny vessel with 1 thruster and see how much it flies?
<alexxm> can't we see more explosions
<Malavolent> Needs more rockets.
<Thorn> THEN LETS MAKE MORE!
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> mica connectors
<Lighty> 06the people from the place where i had a jab interview called back
<derpy_pony> lol
<HiImSpike> killed 9 little green men in less than a minute Sumi
<Phase4`> Sumica: just dump the first stage on the pad
<Thorn> *makes more astronauts*
<Kandarihu> How about attaching the three sections together?
<richfiles> Your survival and sucessful launce rides on the edge of quantum brownian motion variances. :) Enjoy your ride! :$
<Thorn> EXPLOSIONS.
<Lighty> 06i can come on a 2nd interview, and have to bring my BAnk ID and ID cards
<HiImSpike> OWAOH
<Thorn> Aww.
<GlutenFreeJenkins> IT WORKS
*Spectrum_Rush|Plushy mah ears
<Lighty> 06so that is good news
<TheRainbowDash> Wat....
<ponibas> uhhhhhhh
<Malavolent> This won't end well.
<CometSurge> WUT
<Very_Silly_Filly> Those little green men are called Kerbs
<Vordox> LOWER THE VOLUMEEEE
<Thorn> I was expectnf an exploasion.
<TheRainbowDash> That is impossible!:D
<Lil_B> Malavolent I don't want them to change the show XD, i want them to make a second show with a different design and keep both :)
<HiImSpike> we have liftoff
<Phase4`> volume what now?
<valoreins> dafuq is dat mothership?!
<Phase4`> oh mai
<Thorn> Wait for it.
<Thorn> Wait for iit
<alexxm> this can only end well
<Phase4`> OH WOW
<Phase4`> ALL AT ONCE
<Om> Aaaaand no thrust
<HiImSpike> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
<derpy_pony> this might survive long enough
<Spell-of-Gaming> Dear god...
<Lil_B> also, I'm away for now, I have to do a little bit of work :/
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Sure, I wasn't talking about changing the current show, the fandom will still try to make different animation styles.
<diddutz> it nearly movex xD
<Thorn> Sweet jesus its actually working
<Spell-of-Gaming> I never knew a fanime would make me laugh so much
<HiImSpike> its glowing
<Thorn> ITS IN SPACE
<Phase4`> too heavy!
<Very_Silly_Filly> No shit
<Thorn> ITS- ITS IN SPACE1
<alexxm> Spell-of-Gaming can you PM me the link please
<Spectrum_Rush|Plushy> Phase4: well atleast hes still going up
<Malavolent> Phase4: Nonsense, it simply needs more rockets!
<Thorn> wat.
<derpy_pony> it has enough fuel to go to mars and back
<richfiles> SRBs are more powerful than Liquid rockets
<Om> Hey, I heard you like lift off. So we gave you liftoff after we got liftoff
<Kandarihu> So, is this going to run out of fuel?
<derpy_pony> it will leave the atmosphere
<dshannon> its the weight
<Spell-of-Gaming> Add the fanime with Nico Nico Douga comments, done.
<OneTrickPony> hahahahahahaa
<richfiles> That's why they are called boosters.
<Spell-of-Gaming> Have a stomache
<dshannon> its one fat momma
<Rain> this is exactly why we use liquid /after/ the solids
<valoreins> are we going to equestrian moon?
<Lil_B> Bye, see you in max 2 hours
<Om> Always positive mica
<Malavolent> See ya, Lil_B
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Cya Lil_B
<richfiles> You use SRBs in your early stages, to break the gravitational bond. Then liquid to propel once in motion
<derpy_pony> that's why using liquid for the heavy work is a bad idea
<alexxm> bye Lil_B
<valoreins> oh bai Lil_B
<Phase4`> later Lil_B
<Thorn> Is it in space now?
<Rain> lawl
<HiImSpike> bye Lil_B
<HiImSpike> trolololol
<Very_Silly_Filly> If you get out the atmosphere with this load, you will go apeshit far
<ClutterShy> SPAAAAAACE
<Lil_B> and tell Airpuff that Beer-Jelly is theorethicly possible XD
<Vordox> Isn't space like...12 miles up?
<Om> Stiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiil goin.
<richfiles> It could be hit by a 747 right now...
<Vordox> Or was it 89?
*Lil_B hugs chat
<OneTrickPony> bai Lil_B
<Thorn> or was it derp?
<HiImSpike> LUNA we are coming for you
<Phase4`> one tank?
<Phase4`> two left
<Airpuff> Lil_B: O.O
<Thorn> DONT WORRY LUNA!
<valoreins> WOONA WE LOVE YOU!!
<Phase4`> and then more srb's XD
<alexxm> whys are they scare
<Malavolent> Or not.
<Thorn> whoops
<Spell-of-Gaming> So, who asked for the link? :P
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Lol!
<derpy_pony> twelve days later...
<Very_Silly_Filly> 'dat sudden increase
<Vordox> NOW LEt'S SPEED UP!
<Airpuff> Noooooooooooooo!!!!!!!1 He left!!!!!!!!
<dshannon> uhoh
<GlutenFreeJenkins> It's actually working...
<Thorn> WOONA WAIT FOR US
<OneTrickPony> gotta go fast!!!!
<Thorn> WE'LL RESCUE YOU
<Om> We have had very distinkt stages
<ClutterShy> YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE MEEEE!:[
<Inquisitor> oh SHAZBOT!
<alexxm> that can't be good
<derpy_pony> now this looks good
<HiImSpike> Sumica: laugh if you blowed up in space
<Vordox> Sumica: Volume is...breaking my stereoes, at VERY LOW volume? D: Mind turn it down a bit?
<Malavolent> I think it will shoot the moon down along with Luna.
<derpy_pony> to the mooooon!
<RaveBrony> o.o
<Thorn> Or...or not.
<Thorn> Yeah, we're not going to the moon.
<Thorn> SORRY WOONA
<Lambo> Can this rocket tower be bigger?
<GlutenFreeJenkins> [|]_[|]
<Lambo> Why not make 10 stages
<GlutenFreeJenkins> ^
<CometSurge> Wait what
<Vordox> Great! Thank you =3
<diddutz> Lambo: It's worth a try ;)
<CometSurge> The monster rocket is still going?!
<Thorn> Ah well.
<Thorn> SORRY WOONAA
<Vordox> It's going to reach about...180k
<ClutterShy> one of these days alice
<Thorn> SPAACE!
<HiImSpike> lets hope Vordox
<Thorn> SPAAAAAAAAAAACEEEE
<Spectrum_Plush> Phase4: Phase4` didja get DC'd
<ClutterShy> to the moon
<Very_Silly_Filly> I think you can lift off the throttle now
<Phase4`> no, two clients
<Vordox> Well fine then Sumi: How about....280k :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> Save a bit of fuel
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Wow. ;_;
<Spectrum_Plush> ah
<sub06905> yay
<HiImSpike> woooooah
<Spectrum_Plush> Vordox: he did 300k before
<Vordox> Oh feck it...
<Vordox> This is going beyond 500k...
<alexxm> do you plan on them coming back
<Very_Silly_Filly> I think you've left the field already
<diddutz> Vordox: more like 2.8 M i think
<Malavolent> So... is there any specific goal in this game?
<Kandarihu> I just wanted to know who to talk to about possibly having some Magicka streamed on here while the 75% off sale is still going on.
<GlutenFreeJenkins> DEAR GOD
<Inquisitor> you'd figure that momentum in space would mean that after a certain point the gravitational field of the planet COULDN'T snag you
<HiImSpike> mother of all celestia :O
<Malavolent> And rescue Luna, right?
<Om> Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooal!
<alexxm> and blow things up
<Rain> but Inquisitor, gravity exists between all objects
<dshannon> ggeeeeeee!
<Rain> no matter the distiance
<Vordox> You're tilting...
<Rain> zoom in, Sumica
<Inquisitor> but the Further away from Bodies the weaker the field Rain
<Spectrum_Plush> olol
<alexxm> whys the one on the far left scared
<Vordox> XD
<sub06905> to the sun!
<HiImSpike> tooooooo the sun
<richfiles> yay! :)
<HiImSpike> yay
<Thorn> TO THE SUN!
<thegt90> yay
<Arentius> to the sun doesn't quite have the same ring to it
<derpy_pony> gravitational force decreases with the square root of the distance
<alexxm> to the sun
<CometSurge> GO TO THE SUN
<Malavolent> I'm ok with this.
<Rain> yay sun!
<valoreins> oh my...
<Inquisitor> #1 doesn't want to burn in the sun
<OneTrickPony> XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> DENIED
<CupcakeWarrior> Im floating towards the sun, the sun of nothiiiiiiiiiiing
<dshannon> kerbal's are avid believers
<Spectrum_Plush> alexxm: better question why is the middle one alway happy
<Inquisitor> he's flippin his shit
<Very_Silly_Filly> Looks like Venus
<derpy_pony> back to earth
<CometSurge> OH NO!
<Malavolent> Now what.
<HiImSpike> baccck tooooo tha mmooooon
<Vordox> WHAT'S with the stabi...Oh wait..... Space. :P
<Kandarihu> Those kerbals aren't looking very happy.
<Spectrum_Plush> down apperantly sumi
<valoreins> #2 we might find another version of "lestia"
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Orbit?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Turn round!
<derpy_pony> there was fuel left?
<richfiles> orbit?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I wanna see you fall back to earth
<Thorn> floating.
<derpy_pony> cold black space. forever
<Vordox> Where IS Earth?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kearth even
<Thorn> MOON.
<Inquisitor> 3's very placid
<diddutz> use the sun to get higher!
<GlutenFreeJenkins> I lost Earth. D:
<Inquisitor> beyond orbit
<Very_Silly_Filly> DED
<richfiles> HooooooO!
<Rain> lawl
<Vordox> Oh shi...
<dshannon> uhoh
<HiImSpike> deadspace
<ponibas> ummm

<derpy_pony> no worries
<ponibas> we're fooked
<Malavolent> Is there any alicorn on MArs?
<Phase4`> XD
<Rain> lolololol
<HiImSpike> trololololololol
<Inquisitor> he's exceeded excape velocity
<Om> You could have reached the moooon!
<Spectrum_Plush> Vordox: we missed it
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh fuck
<Phase4`> you have escaped its gravity
<CupcakeWarrior> Thats epic
<GlutenFreeJenkins> I'm laughing so hard. :3
<Vordox> What's the distance?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Sumica: I warned you
<derpy_pony> they will die
<valoreins> brb guys enjoy the space
<Malavolent> Team Rocket blasts off again.
<alexxm> where are you going to then
<CometSurge> SPAAAAAACE

<richfiles> OH God!!@!
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Why am I laughing so much? xD
<Vordox> So now we have Princess Luna, Princess Celestia, and Prince Kelps? :P
<Rain> you may one day return to the planet if you get lucky XD
<Ninjazz> It's contagious...
<Ninjazz> :D
<Kandarihu> Rain: if that thing isn't going to return to Earth, I'd say a golden disc is more important.
<Thorn> Kelps.
<Spectrum_Plush> hahahahaha
<ponibas> wow
<Rain> XD
<Thorn> Next game
<Ninjazz> :D
<dshannon> no we must have moar!
<Inquisitor> suffocation, starvation, dehydration, burnt in the sun, freezing to death in the cold vaccum of space
<diddutz> Sumica: stop laughing, it makes me laught, i want to stop but i can't xD
<HiImSpike> laughing is contageous
<derpy_pony> you should have a word with the navigation department
<Thorn> CONTINUE TO THE NEXT GAME
<richfiles> This. Is. GLORIOUS!!!
<dshannon> outside the solar system!
<Vordox> Wait...
<Vordox> That orbit is moving towards the sun....feck
<Rain> sumica, stop giggling XD
<Barrel_of_Fun> they seem alive
<CometSurge> Laughter, so contagious :D
<Phase4`> Sumica: TRY FOR THE MOON
<HiImSpike> precious
<Malavolent> Inquisitor: All that for the sake of science!
<richfiles> Warp factor LOTS
<Rain> inb4 they die of starvation
<Phase4`> YOU HAVE THE TECHONOLGY
<Vordox> SUMICA
<CupcakeWarrior> Sumica broke the game
<Vordox> CHECK THE ORBIT! it's interacting witht he sun almost!
<Dark_of_Max> yep
<HiImSpike> yay
<Very_Silly_Filly> Now all you need is a mechanical failure
<dshannon> and the guy in the middle is happy
<Phase4`> solar orbit is best orbit
<HiImSpike> yay
<HiImSpike> ya
<HiImSpike> y
<Gunthler> Sounds like Sumi is having fun!!! xD
<Rain> detach, ALL the things
<richfiles> MEGAMeters

<GlutenFreeJenkins> ^
<Very_Silly_Filly> Inb4 burn sizzle pain
<Kandarihu> Um, do you even have thrusters?
<Inquisitor> there have been fewer greater sacrifices for science
<CometSurge> WHOOAAAA
<Very_Silly_Filly> Like me :3
<Vordox> Whee is the sun!
<richfiles> You lost your last fuel, right?
<HiImSpike> whoooooa
<Rain> are you able to warp time more?
<dshannon> oh gosh look at that distance meter
<ponibas> and it's almost 4am =p
<alexxm> so what happens to them now
<CometSurge> SPAAAAAAACE
<Malavolent> I've got to get this game :D
<richfiles> Stare at sun. YOur eyes can take it
<derpy_pony> remember the "save a bit of fuel!" advice?
<Vordox> Where's the sun? D:
<Inquisitor> because the space dudes are doomed
<Arentius> so...how are you gonna land without dying?
<dshannon> uhhhhh
<Inquisitor> augh!
<Inquisitor> sun!
<Vordox> OW
<CometSurge> CELESTIA
<dshannon> its dropping
<Spectrum_Plush> MY EYES
<GlutenFreeJenkins> MY EEEEEEEEYES
<HiImSpike> space dudes will be like we are screwed
<ponibas> umm
<Vordox> Hai Sun, how you doing...? :P
<Dark_of_Max> C:
<dshannon> why is your meter dropping?
<Kandarihu> EYEPATCH EMERGENCY!
<Vordox> LOL
<ponibas> are we heading towards it
<Vordox> CHECK THE REACTIONS
<Vordox> XD
<Dark_of_Max> to the sunnnnnn
<Inquisitor> 1 and 3 have realised their predicament
<Rain> look at where the shadow is not coming from
<Very_Silly_Filly> dshannon: Distance from the launch pad
<Sun> Alright, thanks. ^_^
<Vordox> Inquisitor: Yeah XD
<richfiles> SOLAR FLARING ORGASMS OF CELESTIA!!! :O
<Spectrum_Plush> middle guy gives no fucks
<Very_Silly_Filly> Middle guy never gives fucks
<Malavolent> Middle guy already lost it.
<Vordox> Middle guy is having the greatest moment in his life XD
<CometSurge> YOU'RE GAINING ALTITUDE AGAIN :D
<Spectrum_Plush> uh sumi
<Thorn> Hey.
<derpy_pony> is this good or bad?
<HiImSpike> well at lease we beat the record
<ponibas> still over 10m per sec
<Thorn> Kelps. Kelps. Kelps. Kelps.
<Inquisitor> middle guy's still high on endorphens
<dshannon> oh god stop!
<alexxm> sure they're lost in space but the middle guy took a lot of pot bedore going
<GlutenFreeJenkins> EXACTLY. ^_^
<Vordox> alexxm: It's for SCIENCE
<Kandarihu> Sumica: I noticed that the K changed to an M when you passed 999999 Kilometers
<HiImSpike> hahhahahhahahaha LOL
*Spectrum_Plush cant breath:D
<Vordox> How's the Orbit?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Middle guy takes a disaster to make sad
<GlutenFreeJenkins> And that place is air-tight, too. :3
<Phase4`> lolwut
<CometSurge> They're gonna smell his farts FORRRREEEEVVVEEEEERRRRRRRRR
<Kandarihu> Now it's Megameters or something
<Phase4`> dem faces
<Vordox> Yeah that's..errr...
<Rain> lawl
<Om> Bye yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaals!
<Vordox> More Time Warp?
<Phase4`> Sumica: check your orbit again?
<Malavolent> Eventually, you're going to crash into Moon, Sumica.
<Phase4`> XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> Kandarihu: It's in Kilometers...
<WallDives> bye Om.
<diddutz> Sumica: It's an orbit, there is no landing for you anymore...
<Inquisitor> it's just a jump to the left
<derpy_pony> your best chance is to crash into the sun
<sub06905> bye Om
<derpy_pony> earth is out of range
<Ninjazz> Cya Om...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Turn time warp on
<Inquisitor> 34 days... they've starved to death
<Ninjazz> Damn it.
<Vordox> Time warp to 1000000x?
<Rain> 34 days and they are running low on cheese poofs
<dshannon> dang those orgasm can survive
<Phase4`> ah, thats how your loosing speed
<richfiles> Land on the MOON, or sun. Whatever
<Kandarihu> Very_Silly_Filly: well, it had to change his scale now that he's exceed a million kilometers
<dshannon> -_-
<dshannon> dat fail typing
<Vordox> Dang
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Moving back to Aphelion point. ;_;
<Vordox> Dat middle guy is my hero
<ponibas> wonder if we orbit enough, if we'll impact the moon
<Rain> inb4 Sumica just lets it go and eventually slams into the earth
<HiImSpike> little alien guy hey did you pack food. Little space dude 2 woops, little space 3 FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFLUTTERSHY
<alexxm> why are the other two so scared
<sub06905> Space, The Endless Frontier.
<GlutenFreeJenkins> I swear middle guy is high. :3
<richfiles> They are green.... Photosynthesis. Recycled water... They are DOOMED TO FOREVER!!! :O
<Vordox> alexxm: They're fecked XD
<derpy_pony> cannibalism breaks out
<Very_Silly_Filly> Middle guy isn't high
<Rain> they are freaking because they are lost in space
<Very_Silly_Filly> He had an accident at birth
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Lol. ^_^
<Inquisitor> the astronauts have resorted to cannibalism, after smelling the wind #2 passed for the first week, his legs were the first to be sacrificed for the continued survival
<Very_Silly_Filly> The results make him have only 1 emotion: Happy
<Thorn> The middle one farted in their space suits
<Kandarihu> There can't be enough snacks in that command module to last them months. They should be dead of starvation by now.
<Arentius> they don't need food
<Vordox> Kandarihu: Don't bring physics into a game with Physics. XD
<Arentius> they live off fear
<Inquisitor> just open the air locks and end their misery
<HiImSpike> hahahahha Arentius
<Vordox> Mica: Now you wish you had some more fuels? :P
<diddutz> and 50 days!
<richfiles> Oh My
<ponibas> ....
<HiImSpike> ooooh mai
<Vordox> WHAT FUEL!?
<CometSurge> Sumica won the game by breaking it :D
<ninja_pony> hello everypony :)
<HiImSpike> fuel
<derpy_pony> space is getting a bit repetitive
<Barrel_of_Fun> hi ninja_pony
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Hey ninja_pony
<Ninjazz> Do you have enough food though, Sumi?
<HiImSpike> hello ninja_pony
<Ninjazz> Hey ninja_pony!
<alexxm> hey ninja_pony hows your day been
<derpy_pony> hi ninja_pony
<Arentius> is that wheatley I see?
<sub06905> hello ninja_pony
<Vordox> OH Mica! Bring up a soundfile with Space Orb XD
<Rain> LAWL
<Dark_of_Max> guys have a great night/day i need to sleep im prety bad face right now see ya
<OneTrickPony> hi ninja_pony
<Malavolent> Sumi, you won. You had so much fun you won. The game won't respond because you won.
<alexxm> bye Dark_of_Max
<richfiles> Man... And we all thought that first stage was gonna be too much weight! LOL :D
<HiImSpike> scootalo the magical chicken is the only food they have
<Rain> LAWL
<sub06905> night Dark_of_Max
<Very_Silly_Filly> You're about to come into contact with something
<derpy_pony> how? friction?
<diddutz> one half of the orbit you loose speed the other half you gain speed ...
<Kandarihu> I wouldn't suppose you can name your rockets in this game, can you? Might I suggest Buster Machine 0?
<GlutenFreeJenkins> Aaaaaand you're at Aphelion. :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> I didn't doubt you
<Rain> Lawl
<OneTrickPony> Sumica: you should try hitting the sun next time
<Very_Silly_Filly> I wanred you that you would escape
<dshannon> I never doubted you
<derpy_pony> chances to crash into the earth?
<Inquisitor> well after your rocket tried to become a drill.... we did have our misgivings
<HiImSpike> but it didnt go anywhere
<Thorn> Kelps.
<HiImSpike> just 3 little aliens afraid for their lives
<Vordox> Awwwwww! But Space Core!
<Malavolent> This was a triumph.

<Phase4`> Sumica: Name it D:
<Very_Silly_Filly> My racecar makes about that much G when it's going through a corner
<Inquisitor> It made solar orbit.... in 50 days....
<diddutz> now sumica, you know what your next goal is: leave the solar system!
<Vordox> Mica. PM, The Space Core sound files =3
<Spectrum_Plush> oh lawd

<Obsidian> Ha she almost died.......wait
<Vordox> Almost DEATH IN A GIRL SHOW?!
<Phase4> 00,02ah, k
<Saturn> 08,01trust me, unless you're using some kind of VIA clone, it does
<Saturn> 08,01or ARM, in which case SSE2 is completely irrelevant
<Very_Silly_Filly> I know it doesn't run games from 2000
<Rain> Vordox, that happens all the time in many shows >_>
<Vordox> Rain: Yeah but Huuuub!
<Rain> like when Twi had a piano dropped on her head
<Rain> after an anvil
<Rain> and a cart
<Phase4> 00,02stream is up
<Vordox> Phase4: I thought you were too busy to play around and stuff. D:
<CupcakeWarrior> Hey phase
<Phase4> 00,02i was earlier
<Very_Silly_Filly> My Laptop has the RAM and the Processor, but the graphics card is so bad it can't run freaking games as early as 2000
<flutter_spin> da wub
<CupcakeWarrior> Oh god
<TheRainbowDash> Phase4: Team Fortress 2 time again?:)
<CupcakeWarrior> Streamception

<Saturn> 08,01SSE is on the processor
<Kandarihu> Alright. I need to give this laptop some cooldown time. I'll probably be back in a couple of hours.
<TheRainbowDash> If only kirz was here.
<Ninjazz> Ho, shit, Phase4!
<Ninjazz> L4D2?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I thought all the SSE crap was ossociated with graphics cards because the system requires always put it in the GFX
<Obsidian> Later Kandarihu
<alexxm> bye Kandarihu
<Saturn> 08,01also, if your grpahics card has 32 megs of RAM or more, it should support games from 2000
<dshannon> terraria? TERRARIA!
<HiImSpike> my little ponies shooting is magic
<Very_Silly_Filly> Saturn: I can't run a 2001 game even on lowest settings
<Very_Silly_Filly> GP4
<Obsidian> I hear L4D2 Trailer
<Vordox> That sound in the BG XD
<Very_Silly_Filly> I can't run it because I only have a 64 MB GFX
<Kandarihu> But I happen to notice that Magicka is sadly missing from Phase4's game list.
<mutterguy_> hi everyone. phew.. So after seeing Promethius I went and saw Alien and Aliens with friends
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> ughh.... 5 days of making music non stop....ME IS VERY TIRED
<Phase4> 00,02Kandarihu, ikr :(
<Very_Silly_Filly> It can't run Terraria, it can't run Fall0out
<Kandarihu> You know it's on discount, right?
<d3rb> 5 days :D dude take a rest
<CupcakeWarrior> Phase4: What client is that?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I need a Express graphics for it
<Vordox> Phase4: Going for a coop to see the game, or Versus for mass failure? :P
<Saturn> 08,01well, SSE2 is to do with parallel data processing, and imrpoves gaming performance, but it's a feature of the processor
<Kandarihu> CupcakeWarrior: that looks like X-Chat to me.
<Saturn> 08,01Very_Silly_Filly: what graphics card do you have?
<Very_Silly_Filly> A shitty GMA x4500
<Ninjazz> Phase4: You playing L4D2? Can i join?
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's Integrated of course, as it's a laptop
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> lol this minecraft server just got 24 core cpu with 92 gb ddr ram
<Very_Silly_Filly> But I have an Express slot in my Laptop
<Saturn> 08,01a GMA x4500 should be able to run games from recent eras...
<Phase4> 00,02thats more gore than i usualy tollerate
<Saturn> 08,01i think maybe you have somethign set up wrong
<HiImSpike> [wklmjhe]JRP2234: :o
<Vordox> I still say, in comparrison to TF2, TF2 is more gore.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Most games from like 5-8 years ago need about 128 to 256 Mb
<diddutz> Phase4: stream don't capture the game.
<Vordox> Phase4: Yeah, no stream
<Phase4> 00,02oh cool, borderless window mode
<Kandarihu> Vordox: I suppose you're right.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: You can turn the gore down
<Phase4> 00,02i know it didnt, nothing much i could do though
<richfiles> LOL... I only have a GeForce FX 5200. My computer sucks.
<Phase4> 00,02Very_Silly_Filly, THANK GOD
<Phase4> 00,02i knew they nerfed it in aus but didnt know if the steam version was
<Very_Silly_Filly> You can set it to low so it's only textures
<Vordox> Yeah there's an option for that somewhere
<HiImSpike> evga gtx 240 is good for some games
<Phase4> 00,02ok...
<Phase4> 00,02i've never played l4d
<Very_Silly_Filly> In low, I don't think there's gibs unless pipe bomb
<Saturn> 08,01Very_Silly_Filly: anything DX9 or under should work with that card
<HiImSpike> and its cheap
<Phase4> 00,02kerbal finished downloading ^_^
<Saturn> 08,01and it's apparently DX10 compatible
<Saturn> 08,01but very, very slow
<CupcakeWarrior> More SPAAAAACE?
<d3rb> Saturn: what if the card simply has hardware fault?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Saturn: Chances are, my setup is ballsed up, because my tower can't run TF2
<Very_Silly_Filly> and apparent, I've quadruple the minimum requirements
<Phase4> 00,02wheres the gore option?
<Phase4> 00,02there it is
<HiImSpike> Very_Silly_Filly: what you working with
<Vordox> options -> multiplayer -> gore
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's not on Video I don't think
<Phase4> 00,02gore: low
<Phase4> 00,02:)
<Very_Silly_Filly> Right, here's my laptops specs
<Phase4> 00,02stream working?
<Vordox> YEP
<Obsidian> Yes
<Vordox> Got visuals and all
<d3rb> ya huh
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, you host?
<Very_Silly_Filly> 1.8 Gh/z dual core celeron processor, GMA x4500 GFX integrated and 4Gb ram
<Capn_Gavn> thats some prime ass menu navigation right there
<HiImSpike> give him time
<Vordox> Hosting Terraria atm, just let me check
<Vordox> Also, there's dedicated servers
<Phase4> 00,02i think the x4500 was one of the first good ones
<Vordox> So no need for a outside host
<Vordox> Just create a new game.
<Vordox> I'll join if I may? :)
<Very_Silly_Filly> My tower has 1.8 GH/z dual core pentium 4 processor with an ATI radeon x6400 HD PRO and 1GB ram
<Phase4> 00,02k
<Phase4> 00,02this cant be that hard
<Vordox> Err Depends on difficulty
<Vordox> THer'es 4 I think
<HiImSpike> Very_Silly_Filly: thats pretty good
<Very_Silly_Filly> Set it to easy if you want pussy difficulty
<Very_Silly_Filly> My tower NEEDS more RAM
<Vordox> Campign is recommended
<Capn_Gavn> easy is like pasifism mode
<Very_Silly_Filly> 1GB can't play shit nowadays
<CrazyCherry|MC> Der.
<Vordox> Wait, create a game
<CrazyCherry|MC> Derp*
<Vordox> Play with Friends
<Vordox> Create new Campaign
<Phase4> 00,024 slots avaliable
<RaveBrony> :o
<Vordox> 3 slots, with you :P
<RaveBrony> I really need to get L4D2....
<RaveBrony> :'(
<Vordox> More people interested? =3
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have L4D2, but my tower can't run it
<Phase4> 00,02anyone else got l4d2?
<diddutz> I'll join you guys :3
<Phase4> 00,02i'll invite ^_^
<Vordox> Ninjazz: You had L4D2?

<HiImSpike> Very_Silly_Filly: Im working with 3 GH/Z with a i7 dual core 0900k, ASUS Zi250, 4 - 1 gig ddr3 ram and a Evga 570 gtx graphics
<Ninjazz> Hang on... Steam being finicky again.
<Vordox> They can join you and you can invite them
<Vordox> Do you have diddutz steam or Ninjazz ?
<Very_Silly_Filly> HiImSpike: Oh bugger off, you make me jelly D:
<Ninjazz> Steam.
<Ninjazz> Yes.
<Ninjazz> I has it.
<Vordox> So many friends, Phase4 I'm jealous.. :(
<Phase4> 00,02someone just added me
<Phase4> 00,02slots filled ^_^
<Phase4> 00,02Capn_Gavn, ohai
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hold on, is that 1Gb of ram or 4?
<HiImSpike> noooo its my processor is only better evga sucks your graphics is way better
<Vordox> Who is Caaptain?
<RaveBrony> :P
<Capn_Gavn> hai
<Very_Silly_Filly> My graphics is brilliant, yeah
<Very_Silly_Filly> Spent 200 quid on it:3
<Vordox> Already taken the slot Ninjazz :<
<HiImSpike> Very_Silly_Filly: :)
<alexxm> hey Capn_Gavn hows your day been
<HiImSpike> hello Capn_Gavn
<Ninjazz> Vordox: Oh well... I blame Steam. :(
<Very_Silly_Filly> If I get the money, I'll probably build a laptop
<HiImSpike> kool :$
<Very_Silly_Filly> Try and fit 8-16 GB in, with mabye ani5 processor
<Vordox> Phase4: There is ONE thing with Official
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Vordox> You can get bad servers and edited, modded and original servers.
<Vordox> (Ala TF2)
<Very_Silly_Filly> Vordox: That's on Best avalible
<HiImSpike> true their is no difference between i5 and i7
<Phase4> 00,02ah
<Capn_Gavn> its been fine., mum had a guy over about renting the spare room
<Very_Silly_Filly> Offical is Valve server
<Vordox> You sure Very_Silly_Filly ? I've had some weird times when I got into something really weird. =/
<Phase4> 00,02HiImSpike, there are differences, i7 is quad and has the virt extentions
<Very_Silly_Filly> i7 has a small difference, but the price is retarded
<Phase4> 00,02Mostly the same though
<Chrysalis> Very_Silly_Filly the price isnt that bad if your after the advantages it offers
<Vordox> Chrysalis: Like what?
<Phase4> 00,02and i5 is most likley a slightly faulty i7
<Very_Silly_Filly> Well, processor speed is fine for agaming atm
<Chrysalis> but for most users those advantages are negligable
<diddutz> a snail coul'd move faster than my loading bar -.-
<HiImSpike> Phase4: True but when coming to puff processing power the core is about the same depend but k processong power you get
<CrazyCherry|MC> :p'd
<alexxm> what was coach standing on
<Lil_B> hey, i only needed 1 hour for the work :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: Since you're a noob, I'd reccomend melee
<Lambo> I wish I had L4D2 uncensored...
<Lambo> Fucking germany
<alexxm> Lil_B what work were you doing
<Lambo> Could only buy censored version
<Phase4> 00,02k
<Chrysalis> things like cache size are generally bigger on the 7s
<alexxm> Lambo is the steam version censored
<Chrysalis> alexxm it is in certain countries
<HiImSpike> kiddy land
<Lambo> alexxm: In germany you can only buy censored version of L4D2. At some point I will rebuy the game in UK or Austria or Switzerland, so I can replace the key with the support
<alexxm> Chrysalis odd i thought it'd be one version on steam
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lambo: Screw coming to UK for holiday, just move here already! :D
<Chrysalis> its because they dont have a proper "adult" rating in certain countries
<Chrysalis> as such they need to censor to sell at all
<Lambo> Mh, would you guys take MSI or EVGA for graphics card supplier?
<WallDives> brb
<HiImSpike> EVGA
<Chrysalis> MSI are a VERY good brand for cards
<Chrysalis> mine take some serious abuse and run fine
<Lil_B> alexxm removing weeds, sweeping the walkway infront of my house, cleaning the floors on the first floor
<Lambo> EVGA has got this insane warranty deal. But I don't know whether that is any good in the end
<alexxm> Lambo how censored is it anyways
<Chrysalis> cards burn out in 2-4 years anyway warrentee or no
<Very_Silly_Filly> alexxm: VERY
<Lambo> alexxm: No gore. Zombies disappear. They don't looks limbs, or open bodies
<Very_Silly_Filly> Next to no gore
<Chrysalis> blood is removed, persistant bodies
<Lambo> I fucking hate it
<Lil_B> Lambo /) from germany :D
<Lambo> I am an adult, and this government treats me like an idiot
<HiImSpike> true but the evga has more standing gaming time because the cool of the card wont make the game lag over a period of time
<derpy_pony> that's why I never buy games.
<derpy_pony> censorship
<d3rb> Lambo: i know that feel, australia is the same
<Chrysalis> hah "standard gaming time"
<xRabidSmurfx> I live in america
<Chrysalis> what a useless metric
<Lambo> So, whenever I be able to buy L4D2 uncensored for 5-10 bucks, I will gladly do it
<xRabidSmurfx> We don't even know what censored means
<Chrysalis> they never test under actual gaming environments
<Very_Silly_Filly> I guess one reason I hate britain is because half of my owned guns are illegal to own :/
<HiImSpike> meaning it want lag to the heat of the card
<Very_Silly_Filly> Or take out to public rather
<Lambo> America is the fucking oposit. You love gore and violence, but can not even show a single fucking nipple
<Chrysalis> theyll run the card at maybe 70% tops
<Lil_B> I wanted to buy the orange box 15 before my 18th birthday... i wasn't allowed to :/
<d3rb> how many guns do you have Very_Silly_Filly ?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have 13
<Lil_B> 15 days*
<xRabidSmurfx> True.
<d3rb> :O why?
<CrazyCherry|MC> asdasdasdasdasda
<Chrysalis> i thought americas headache was swearing
<Very_Silly_Filly> I like to collect
<Ninjazz> lol Phase4.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Most of them are quite old
<HiImSpike> crap
<d3rb> fair enough i guess
<derpy_pony> xRabidSmurfx: except when it comes to uncovered skin...your people are almost as prude as the arabs
<CrazyCherry|MC> Chrysalis: Hail the queen. *Kneels before you*
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have a 1940's luger
<Very_Silly_Filly> From WWII
<d3rb> cool
<Lil_B> to be honest, i probably would probably turn of the gore in L4D2 to get a better performance
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lil_B: It doesn't affect performance too much
<Chrysalis> l4d2 is both old and well written
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly wow... I don'Ät know much about weapons, but i do know how a luger looks
<Lambo> Of course Left 4 Dead 2 was one of the few games I could not get from Amazon.de Uk imported
<Chrysalis> you really shouldnt have any issues with performance
<Lambo> Gladly I got the Orange Box from the UK from Amazon.de
<Very_Silly_Filly> This game can run, but it takes 5 years to load everything
<HiImSpike> more the lag
<Lil_B> Chrysalis every time i play L4D2 my PC gets kinda loud...
*CrazyCherry sobs in a corner.'
<Lil_B> Chrysalis every time i play L4D2 my PC gets kinda loud...
<Lambo> Today Is the last day where I can return the MSI 560 gtx ti...
<Chrysalis> Lil_B well duh, all your cooling will spin up
*alexxm hugs CrazyCherry whats the matter
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hehe
<d3rb> why so sad CrazyCherry?
<Very_Silly_Filly> If gore was on, thered be headless zombies everywhere
<Chrysalis> i run 7 fans in my computer, how loud do you think that gets?
<CrazyCherry> EV'RYDAY I'M SHUFFLING!!!!
<Lil_B> Chrysalis i know.. i mean in comparison to my other games
*CrazyCherry shuffles.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Chrysalis: I'm hoping to get water cooling for mine
<Chrysalis> which are?
<d3rb> CrazyCherry: omg me too!
<xRabidSmurfx> Language isn't a major problem, well not as much as naked flesh. I saw an episode of south park the other day that said shit 162 times is what i the counter said
<Very_Silly_Filly> They need to hurry up and make water cooling for laptops
<Chrysalis> they wont ever do that
<HiImSpike> Chrysalis: what brand of tower you have
<Chrysalis> watercooling is definately not portable
<HiImSpike> true
<Chrysalis> HiImSpike i built it myself
<HiImSpike> nice
<Very_Silly_Filly> They'll make one ventually
<Very_Silly_Filly> I mean think how small storage is getting
<Very_Silly_Filly> No!
<CrazyCherry> BRB Everypony going to relocate!!!
<Chrysalis> Very_Silly_Filly its a physics thing
<d3rb> and how hot laptops are :D
<Chrysalis> they can't
<HiImSpike> haahha==a
<Lambo> Man, I seek the day when I will only have SSDs in my pc
<d3rb> ^
<Chrysalis> Lambo you can do that now
<Chrysalis> if your willing to payu
<d3rb> $$$
<Lambo> 120 gb SSD is cheap already. But anything above is expensive as fuck
<Lil_B> Chrysalis newer games are: Tropico 4, Port Royal 3, Portal 2, Amnesia, Duke Nukem Forever and ANNO 2070
<d3rb> give it a year or 2
<Chrysalis> Lil_B none of those are intensive though
<xRabidSmurfx> Amnesia is terrifying
<Lambo> Shit, I want Anno 2070. I hope they will put it on Sale for 10 bucks later this year
<Very_Silly_Filly> Zombies are people too 3:
<d3rb> its a good game lambo
<Chrysalis> i did enjoy 2070
<Lambo> Anyone who hasn't already, buy the Humble Indie Bundle V. Pay more than the avergae and you get Lone Survivor
<Chrysalis> we should try to setup a big vs match
<Lambo> Awesome game
<Very_Silly_Filly> I can't run shit on this humble on ratthlebox
<HiImSpike> is 2070 that city building game
<Lil_B> Chrysalis ANNO 2070 can get very intensive when I turn things up, i have it on the lowest possible setting... I really just need a new PC
<Chrysalis> or just upgrade it
<d3rb> HiImSpike: yep
<HiImSpike> kool
<Very_Silly_Filly> My Tower is very quiet
<Lambo> I can run every game I own on my pc right now on fullest settings
<Chrysalis> just see where your WEI is lowest and swap in a new one
<Very_Silly_Filly> Only has 1 fan, and it can keep the whole damn thing cool
<Lambo> Damn consoles are keeping me back
<Very_Silly_Filly> I've given up with consoles
<d3rb> what sort of hardware you got Lambo ?
<Chrysalis> Lambo theyv been holding PC back for years
<Lil_B> Chrysalis my current PC as a cheap pre-Build one, it doesn't like upgrades, I will make the new one so i can Upgrade it easily
<Chrysalis> main advice, dont be cheap on the case
<Very_Silly_Filly> Xbox 360 runs L4D at a shit framrate
<Very_Silly_Filly> Only runs it at 45 FPS
<Lambo> d3rb: i5 2600k, msi 560 gtx ti (for now, maybe return it later today), 8 gb ram
<Chrysalis> while it doesnt seem important, a big case it essential
<d3rb> nice nice
<HiImSpike> nice set up Lambo
<Very_Silly_Filly> Would cooling fins affect PC temperature?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: I'd reccomend pills
<Chrysalis> not really
<Lambo> But my most precious things are my Beyerdynamic DT 770 pro
<d3rb> mine WAS good....when i got it :D
<Phase4> 00,02k
<Lambo> Love the headphones. Although it gets creepy playing Dead Space
<Very_Silly_Filly> Mine was good when I got it
<Chrysalis> one with fan grills on the top will help more
<rdibp> good morning everypony
<Chrysalis> mornin
<xRabidSmurfx> Good morning
<HiImSpike> hellp rdibp
<d3rb> g'day rdibp
<WallDives> morning, rdibp.
<Obsidian> Morning rdibp
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lol, you lot are terrible
<rdibp> i want l4d2 so bad :(
<Lil_B> HiImSpike in ANNO games, you have a lot of islands and you conolize them, you can trade with other towns, you can make war, but the main objective is to build a city on one island and manage the production of rescurces and roducts
<HiImSpike> boom baby
<rdibp> lol :D
<Lambo> I may get that new Asus mainboard with Thunderbolt, in a few weeks
<Lil_B> hi rdibp ;)
<Vordox> Press E to close and open stuff, Phase4 =3
<Phase4> 00,02but its soo hard :'(
<Vordox> Phase4: You're doing great!
<Phase4> 00,02gore is still higher than i'd like
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: Your team is so terrible :D
<Lambo> I still need a new PSU
<d3rb> Im still running a motherboard with ddr2 ffs, damn you lambo
<CometSurge> Success!
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<Lambo> 325 wattage is definitly not enough
<Obsidian> U can do it Phase4
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: Nowhere near is what it is on high
<HiImSpike> Lil_B: thanks for the info I will watch some video of it later
<Vordox> Very_Silly_Filly: Low filly low :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> High has you blowing zombies in half
<HiImSpike> at lease 500 watts
<Lambo> I think that is the reason that one time my graphics went down horribly. Just not enough wattage
<rdibp> the quality is better
<Very_Silly_Filly> My laptop fan is crap
<Very_Silly_Filly> I need to get a new one
<HiImSpike> yeah
<Very_Silly_Filly> Keeps emergency overheating power off
<Chrysalis> when you go for wattage, NEVER go for one thats just big enough
<d3rb> more is ALWAYS better
<Chrysalis> always go for 50% ABOVE what you need
<HiImSpike> ive got 700
<Very_Silly_Filly> Be careful though
<Very_Silly_Filly> You could fry it
<d3rb> future proof
<Chrysalis> youll get more stable voltages and all your hardware will run longer
<Chrysalis> HiImSpike i run a 1k
<d3rb> i got 850 watt...i have yet to fry anything
<Chrysalis> Very_Silly_Filly nope
<Lil_B> I don't know if i should wait untill DDR4 RAM next year or build one later this year :/... and should it run Win7 or Linux... all the choices :(
<Very_Silly_Filly> Does anyone know any good grahics cards for an express slot?
<HiImSpike> can never go to hi Chrysalis
<HiImSpike> :)
<Chrysalis> Lil_B go for ddr3, your harddrive will be your biggest bottleneck anyway
<d3rb> higher watt power supplies look cooler too
<d3rb> most important part
<HiImSpike> or corsair is also good
<HiImSpike> little expensive but good
<Very_Silly_Filly> Or you could just get a Falcon
<HiImSpike> true
<Very_Silly_Filly> All you need is around 2000 quid :)
<Chrysalis> d3rb quite a few are modular as well, which is really nice for airflow
<Lil_B> Chrysalis I know, and the HD Prices still have to drop further, i was also thinking about putting a small SSD drive for the operating systhem in there, but i think i would blow my budget then
<d3rb> <3 modular, so much neater
<rdibp> you are a very silly filly Very_Silly_Filly :$
<Lambo> Gonna buy me a main SSD soon. 120gb for 100 bucks
<Very_Silly_Filly> Buy an external hard drive, they are cheap
<HiImSpike> ive got a 320 gig ssd
<Lambo> I will need SSDs soon, anyway, for my new camera
<Very_Silly_Filly> And just open it up and take out the hard drive
<Lambo> Then I will TONS of SSD
<d3rb> but thats just silly! :)
<Chrysalis> Very_Silly_Filly its still cheaper to buy the drives straight up
<Very_Silly_Filly> I bought a 500 Gb XHD for 50 quid
<HiImSpike> Chrysalis: are you working with 2 particions
<Lambo> Camera with internal SSd recorder -> http://www.blackmagic-design.com/products/blackmagiccinemacamera/design/
<Chrysalis> dont need partitions, i have 3x1TB drives in my machine
<Very_Silly_Filly> I had a 69 gig hard drive in my old laptop
<HiImSpike> 3 t that huge man
<d3rb> damn, now THATS a camera
<Lil_B> Having a Tape drive would also be neat, I have a Ton of Music, and a friend of mine recently lost 50% of his music because 2 of his older hard-drives died
<Very_Silly_Filly> My dads has around 1.5 Tb
<Lambo> My father told me he once paid 500 bucks for 5mb drive...
<HiImSpike> ive got 1.5 terabyte too
<d3rb> just replace harddrives every other year, they are cheap enough and data is priceless
<Lambo> d3rb: You mean, porn is priceless
<rdibp> all i know is my computer is a piece of crap
<HiImSpike> and a 1terabyte external
<d3rb> exactly
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lambo: My dad paid about 100 quid for a 50 Mb hard drive for his PC :)
<HiImSpike> haa bit old
<Very_Silly_Filly> I think this was in the 90's
<HiImSpike> I would say
<Lambo> Man, I wish I could go back in time with a Playstation 3 and show them early gamers our games...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Lambo: What, and get CoD in 1990.
<Very_Silly_Filly> No thanks.
<HiImSpike> you would be rich
<Chrysalis> thing is when you get to these sorts of capacities, you usually use it all
<Chrysalis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CFnM4SYQC8&feature=g-u-u
<d3rb> i wish i still had my first pc, pentium 1 166mhz, 32meg of ram and 1.9 gig hdd
<Chrysalis> oops wrong link
<d3rb> BEAST
<CometSurge> Lambo: indeed
<HiImSpike> hahahahha beast
<Lil_B> Lambo, well... play PSE in 420p in 4:3 then XD
<Lil_B> PS3*
<Very_Silly_Filly> My first computer was a laptop from 1999
<HiImSpike> mine is a 1995
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: There's better weapons behind you
<Lambo> "This is your SNES? Guess what, this Cellphone can play games 100 times as good."
<HiImSpike> 12 gig
<Phase4> 00,02?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: Those weapons on the table are better
<HiImSpike> hdd
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nab one
<HiImSpike> and 512 graphics
<d3rb> id still rather the snes lambo
<Lambo> d3rb: True
<SweetieBell> Carebears is coming on soon lol
<Very_Silly_Filly> I still have my SNES in top top condition
<Very_Silly_Filly> No yellowing on it as of far
<Lambo> d3rb: -> http://thedoghousediaries.com/3545
<Lambo> I wish my mother didn't sell the PSOne and N64
<Very_Silly_Filly> My oldest console is my Vectrex
<Evil_Spike> Why did you let her?
<Lambo> Only recently I played Metal Gear Solid 1 on an emulator for the first time. It. Was. Awesome.
<d3rb> :D Lambo so true
<HiImSpike> Sega is mine
<Lil_B> I still have my N64 my first own console :'(
<Lambo> Evil_Spike: I was 10 years old, what could I do
<Very_Silly_Filly> The vectrex is from 1982
<WallDives> Master System, what?
<Evil_Spike> I still remember playing the Atari 2600
<Evil_Spike> And I'm only 20
<HiImSpike> haaa
<d3rb> nice one Evil_Spike
<Very_Silly_Filly> I'm not that old
<HiImSpike> atari serous
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have a few collections
<d3rb> all i had was nes
<Very_Silly_Filly> I have 3 collections of 3 different things
<Very_Silly_Filly> DON'T SHOOT HER Phase4
<Evil_Spike> As well as clear memories of playing Impossible Mission on the Commodore 64
<WallDives> actually, Arcade is my first console...
<HiImSpike> best game i have ever played was et
<Phase4> 00,02:P
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ahh, too late
<Phase4> 00,02it was over by the time you said that
<Very_Silly_Filly> Never do that on Expert
<HiImSpike> hahahahaa
<Evil_Spike> Obvious troll is obvious
<Very_Silly_Filly> Also nab the spas 12
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's an autoshotgun
<Lambo> Every weekend I woke up at 06:00 to play Legend Of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Supermario 64 or Banjo Kazooie
<CometSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: So are Left 4 Dead games fun?
<Very_Silly_Filly> CometSurge: Yeah
<Lil_B> I'm also 20, I remeber that I played Donkey Kong Country when i was 6 once... othet then that, I mostly played N64 and some DOS games when i was small...
<Very_Silly_Filly> Phase4: I'd reccomend the tactical shotgun
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's an autoshotgun
<HiImSpike> zelda is s0oooooooooooo good
<Evil_Spike> I was afraid you had said Superman 64 for a moment there
<Very_Silly_Filly> sumerpan 64
<HiImSpike> I actually loved it
<Lil_B> Majoras Mask is best Zelda
<R-Dash5000> CARE. BEARS. SHOWING. IN. ONE. MINUTE. SWAG.
<Evil_Spike> So we are watching Care Bears?
<Very_Silly_Filly> My favourite zelda is OoT 3D, then probably Skyward sword
<Lambo> I am still not sure whether I should go for a PS3 finally. I still need to buy new PSU, more hard drive space, and one or two new monitors
<d3rb> sawg indeed rd5000
<d3rb> swag**
<Very_Silly_Filly> Skyward sword was really good
<Evil_Spike> Skyward Sword has serious issues
<WallDives> Very_Silly_Filly, no love for the oracle series?
<CometSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: can't get them with this old laptop :D
<Very_Silly_Filly> But tedious as hell
<Evil_Spike> No exploration WHATSOEVER!
<Very_Silly_Filly> WallDives: Never played the oracles
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly Scyward Sword was good, i even played it again in hero-mode XD
<HiImSpike> mine was ocarina of time on the 64
<Very_Silly_Filly> I played links awakening
<HiImSpike> that was ok
<Lil_B> Very_Silly_Filly:
<Lambo> Unfortunately console architecture is still so very different, so we can not have us PS3 emulators...
<Evil_Spike> Twilight Princess is still my favourite Zelda game
<Lambo> But they are already using PC grpahics cards
<Saturn> 08,01Lambo: well, we can
<HiImSpike> didnt like the swimming and riding
<Saturn> 08,01really easily, actually
<Saturn> 08,01but they'd be hella slow
<Very_Silly_Filly> I wish they'd hurry up and hack the 3DS, I cannot afford 35 quid per game
<R-Dash5000> Time: 8 am EST/7 am CST/5 am PST. Guess what's showing on The Hub now.
<Lambo> Saturn: Show me one decent one
<HiImSpike> true
<Evil_Spike> Care Bears?
<Lil_B> Forget what i said about MM, Link's Awakening, my first ever Zelda game on my own BW gameboy ;) THE MEMORYS!
<Saturn> 08,01Lambo: that's what i said; they'd be hella slow
<d3rb> home improvement
<d3rb> ?
<Lambo> In 10 years we will have decent PS3 emulators...
<Very_Silly_Filly> You need around 8-16 Gb of ram to run a PS3 emu
<Saturn> 08,01as always, i made no claims to decency
<HiImSpike> you got the sd card
<Evil_Spike> Anypony ever played Mole Mania on GB?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Course I have the SD card, I need it to play
<Lambo> my first gameboy game was Pokemon Yellow Edition I think - or Link's awakening
<Saturn> 08,01Lambo: simply emulating the architecture isn't a problem. it's emulating it at a usable speed that's the problem. and yes, in 10 years, we might have hardware fast enough for it.
<d3rb> oh that reminds me i left my ps3 on
<HiImSpike> sorry ive got something called R4 which lets me play all games
<Very_Silly_Filly> My first Gameboy game was Tetris
<Evil_Spike> Mole Mania was my first Gameboy game
<HiImSpike> pokemon for me
<Saturn> 08,01either that, or do some kind of JIT translation on the fly
<Evil_Spike> It is a highly underrated game, Mole Mania
<Very_Silly_Filly> The 3DS can't play 3DS games that are hacked
<Obsidian> Mine was pokemon blue
<R-Dash5000> Will somepony stream ponies at 10:00 later via The Hub? I want to see live television ponies where it's finally catchable for me. (It's at 10 pm here.)
<WallDives> what about pokemons?
<Saturn> 08,01but that's be... kinda crazy
<Lil_B> I even got threw the Color dungeon in Links awakening DX in on my old gameboay XD
<Lambo> Saturn: But I want the games now D: - as soon as they fucking finally release The Last Guardian....
<WallDives> I still have my old gameboy with tetris.
<d3rb> then...buy a ps3?
<Lil_B> I even still have my old savestate, with 497 deaths
<Evil_Spike> So do I
<Very_Silly_Filly> You can hack it to use the R4, but you can only play DS games on it
<Lambo> d3rb: Yes, but still need to buy some other things
<Evil_Spike> But it's a Gameboy Pocket
<Saturn> 08,01Lambo: then you either need a lot of money, or a time machine
<Very_Silly_Filly> But there's a number of 3DS games I want
<Saturn> 08,01the latter kinda implies the former, though
<R-Dash5000> In Aussie, Saturday ponies are at midnight.
<d3rb> make a money machine
<Very_Silly_Filly> And get arrested?
<Saturn> 08,01i've always wanted to try my hand at forging money
<Evil_Spike> Which part of Australia though, eastern or western states?
<d3rb> ok make an invisible money machine
<Saturn> 08,01it's really interesting, the kind of security devices they use on notes and coins
<R-Dash5000> Eastern. West is at 10 pm.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Forging GBP is pretty difficult
<Saturn> 08,01i think forging coins would be easier
<d3rb> aud is pretty hard to forge
<Evil_Spike> Which is for me a good thing, living in Perth
<Lil_B> d3rb that prints invisible 100$ bills?
<Lambo> Forging US bills is quite easy
<Lambo> Euro bills is much harder
<d3rb> nah printing is visible but the machine isnt
<Very_Silly_Filly> British notes have foil in between the tissues
<Very_Silly_Filly> But there's only 1 layer of paper
<R-Dash5000> If it's 10 am Eastern, What time would it be in the UK? SWAG.
<HiImSpike> french and american money seems not that hard
<Evil_Spike> R-Dash5000, I'm assuming you're TheRainbowDawn, right?
<Very_Silly_Filly> They banned £50 notes because they were too often forged
<R-Dash5000> No. Swag.
<Evil_Spike> On the bronies Australia forum
<Very_Silly_Filly> This was before they put foil in them
<R-Dash5000> It's June 9th. June 9th is 6-9. 6-9 equals 6_9.
<CometSurge> JAYSUS
<Very_Silly_Filly> Grrr. Ellis is so annoying
<HiImSpike> burn it burn it with fire

<Airpuff> Omg *-*
<alexxm> so are there still only 13 episodes or have more been ordered
<Lil_B> Airpuff you would neet to let it that off a while, and then its only a matter of how much suger/water/beer, you need
<Lil_B> let it stand off*
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ooh, granny launcher
<Airpuff> 6_9
<Lil_B> so all the Carbonacid (the bubbles) get out
<R-Dash5000> If MLP will have 79 episodes, just like 2 other shows Lauren Faust made, Season 3 will have 26 episodes or there will be a season 4 with 13 and a movie.
<Airpuff> Lil_B: i see

<WallDives> Very_Silly_Filly, if you like it, go for it.
<alexxm> whats it about Very_Silly_Filly
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's basically a hack/slash for the 3ds
<Very_Silly_Filly> A mixture of WoW and D3
<WallDives> oh, I remember this place.
<WallDives> TAAAAAAAAAANK!
<Very_Silly_Filly> This bit is retarded on Expert

<Vordox> You thought the game would be scary, Phase4 ?
<Phase4> 00,02Vordox, yes and no
<Vordox> I still remember your first reaction. XD
<Vordox> "BIG THING"
<Phase4> 00,02all i knew is it was some type of team survival game
<Phase4> 00,02XD
<flutterfriend> ill tell you what game is scary... amnesia
<Phase4> 00,02yeah, it was coming after me so i was like "Screw dis"
<Vordox> Don't underestimate the special infected.
<Vordox> They CAN tear you apart. :P
<flutterfriend> so anyway what are we watching
<d3rb> i keep hearing about this amnesia game, is it good?
<Sylandest> morning, everypony! :) *yawns* how are we all today?
<Vordox> flutterfriend: Phase4 FIRST encounter with the game L4D2
<alexxm> hey Sylandest hows your day been
<d3rb> morning Sylandest
<flutterfriend> good sylandest
<Capn_Gavn> i got constantly molestd by the specials in that game
<|Discord|> So Phase is streaming L4D2? Tat game is goooood
<Very_Silly_Filly> Tanks are bastards on Expert
<WallDives> morning, Sylandest.
<MegaMoonShine> Hi Sylandest
<Vordox> d3rb: If you want it to scare you, it will, if you do not want to be scared, meh
*Sylandest hugs everypony good morning
<Sylandest> alexxm: I only just woke up, so i suppose good so far, hehe
<d3rb> so the game itself is ok or average but scary?
<Sylandest> WallDives: have I missed much while I was out?
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's not scary
<flutterfriend> same here sylandest
<Vordox> d3rb: nONONONO the game is FRICKING scary
<Vordox> d3rb: It's GREAT for what it is, but it's ...kinda ruined by the fans
<WallDives> Sylandest, not really.
<flutterfriend> i just dont get scared easily
<flutterfriend> despite my name
<flutterfriend> <---
<d3rb> lol :D ok i'll keep that in mind. i know very little about it so that may be an advantage
<Vordox> d3rb: Then the game will WRECK YOU and SCARE you
<Very_Silly_Filly> It won't
<Very_Silly_Filly> Honestly
<Very_Silly_Filly> I played L4D1 at the age of 11
<Sylandest> oi, Airpuff! You manage to find that charger cable? :D
<alexxm> Vordox how scary is it
<d3rb> i'm gonna see how much it is on steam now,
<Very_Silly_Filly> And thats apparently darker
<Vordox> alexxm: Depends, how do you play games
<Airpuff> Sylandest: indeed o.o
<flutterfriend> lol this is definatly not as entertaining as the stuff like 2 weeks ago
<Airpuff> After i fell asleep o.o
<Vordox> Very_Silly_Filly: L4D was the scary game, L4D2 is the "in the brighter things"
<alexxm> depends on what game it is Vordox
<Vordox> alexxm: Amnesia
<Very_Silly_Filly> L4D has less contrast and colours and everything
<Very_Silly_Filly> But it still wasn't sccary
<Sylandest> Airpuff: haha, go figure. You didn't miss too much, though you still missed a couple good laughs here and there
<flutterfriend> L4D? dude i played that game in like 6 hours and didnt jump once
<R-Dash5000> Over at BronyTV, The royal wedding is showing.
<Airpuff> Sylandest: Aw.. :'(
*Sylandest hugs Airpuff

<Airpuff> Sylandest: mhm :I
<Sylandest> FlareChaser: morning, Flare! How are you today?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I don't find amnesia scary at all, so that probably says something about me
<Very_Silly_Filly> But hell
<Vordox> Any luck Ninjazz?
<Very_Silly_Filly> L4D isn't scary at all anyway
<FlareChaser> Sylandest: I am doing just great! how about you? :)
<flutterfriend> oh yeah lol i got 2 girls to feel my muscles the other day and im stronger than her x
<Sylandest> Vordox: Ninjazz is not here...:S

<Very_Silly_Filly> alexxm: On expert, zombies hit for 20 from the front
<alexxm> bye Obsidian
<Sylandest> laters, Obsidian
<Very_Silly_Filly> I think using a melee weapon is a bit suicidal
<alexxm> Very_Silly_Filly ah right never played on expert mode before
<Very_Silly_Filly> It's hard
<Very_Silly_Filly> I can only just manage it

<d3rb> i dont know
<Evil_Spike> Not all applications
<d3rb> im intrested in it but the idea of a lack of compatibility is annoying
<Very_Silly_Filly> Not all of them
<Very_Silly_Filly> But you can install a virtual windows on it
*d3rb yawns.....need more coffee
<Very_Silly_Filly> That's what I did back when I had a crappy mac

<Very_Silly_Filly> I've known him on Bronystate a long time though
<alexxm> alright then
<Very_Silly_Filly> Knew him before he became a techie, never mind a mod :)
<Cypresswolf> As soon as I put that thing together, I can get some proper measurement for the Redwall project in minecraft
<Lil_B> everyone: hover with your mouse on the "Bronystate Mane Chat" above the Chatbox and ready the text
<Very_Silly_Filly> Everything is bees
<Very_Silly_Filly> ...

<Yokupony> TrixieBaconMuffin: I know right, it must be hard for you to believe :)
*Cyrus_123 creates a challenge to listen to micthemicrophonezeros dramatic reading of my little dashie
<Malavolent> Lil_B: Shame on you :D
<Yokupony> Scotland is in the UK......
<DocSane> I refuse to read a story that's essentially about a lonely man who wishes he could raise a daughter.
<CometSurge> Saturn: for the record, I love almost all accents in the whole world :D
<WallDives> rdibp, I'm sorry, I've seen worse than to let a fic get to me.

<Stardust_Phoenix> whos streaming?
<EggWhite> Can I request you to take no requests?
<DocSane> Kandarihu: I know people who are professional scientists in academia. You don't get rich off of this stuff.
<Vordox> DocSane: Theone with the mouth wins..

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I just do.
<drbrony> http://i.imgur.com/ZQEkK.jpg
<DocSane> Kandarihu: Yes, Big Science. The notion that academia is a giant machone for extracting grant money that engages in conspiracies to fake findings.
<Alchemist> Who said scietnists get mad money for being scietnists?
<Kandarihu> I'm just saying that this whole shoving the manmade climate change theory down all of our throats is nothing more than a plot to give absolute power over everyone's lives to the government.
<FillyFlam> He's ND he does what he wants.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01FillyFlam: Exactly.
<DocSane> Kandahiru: No, see, what you just wrote IS a conspiracy theory.
<Litwick> SCREW THE RULES, HE'S ND
<Kandarihu> Science doesn't benefit from this. It's throwing the scientific process out the window just to throw everyone's freedoms out the window.
<AppleEric> |Discord|: i hate coffee too, and thats why i have to add milk and crap for it to be bearable
<MrMaxaminus> Just that huh.
<SaneSurge> Space Invaders tattoo rocks
<Kandarihu> Agenda 21 isn't a theory.
<The9001thPony> put pony polka back on. :D
<DocSane> Kandahiru: Oh, are you one of those people?

<Biglaw> 0o0
<|Discord|> GIRLS ON FiM
<cachi01> WUUUUUUUUUUT?
<DocSane> Kandahiru: Agenda 21 is a set of loose policies that aim to encourage sustainability
<AppleEric> Nittany_Discord: that is the only way to drink coffee
<Vordox> Has everyone here read the alternative "Previous "elements of Harmony? =3 IT WAS AWESOME COMIC SERIES
<Stardust_Phoenix> will there be aquabats today?
<Tovler> I'm glad I muted Kandarihu weeks ago
<Articuno> Ahh the library.. if it was nearer I might have walked to it today.. but can';t do any proper walking :/
<pony19124> wht is this?/
<DocSane> Kandahiru: It, like the UN, has absolutely no power at all. None
<FillyFlam> You know the song that I put on goes surprisingly well with this PMV.
<Skylands> 10Mm? Why not?
<Articuno> I love the library :3
<alexxm> how come Tovler
<kangaroojac> Kandahiru?
<Articuno> I just had my wisdom teeths out ^v^;
<Vordox> DocSane: Go say no to your authority, see how long you last?
<derpy_pony> holy fuck! goal for denmark!
<Articuno> and if my blood starts pumping it could cause me to bleed
<DocSane> Vordox: The UN has authority over me?
<pony19124> what is this?!
<Articuno> I tore open a large package yesterday and that was enough to make me bleed!!
<Elondras> derpy_pony WHAT?? :O
<Vordox> DocSane: You're part of a country taht endoorses in it, right?
<Tovler> alexxm: I'm not very good with his type of people
<Vordox> Bah grammar
<pony19124> backflash
<Elondras> they are leading versus NETHERLAND??
<alexxm> alright Tovler
<Skylands> 10Ah. I'm getting my wisdom teeth out quite early, next month actually
<kangaroojac> skype noises
<DocSane> Vordox: We endorse it only so long as it does what we want.
<derpy_pony> netherlands - denmark 0:1
<Articuno> Are they really bothering you?
<Kandarihu> Mods, could you please put a ban without a kick until Tovler agrees to unmute me? If one person can't respect my right to talk about important things, I don't want that sort of inconsistancy between who can hear me and who cannot.
<Alchemist> all time favorite :)
<SaneSurge> :$ THIS SONG
<Staraptor> 2Augh wisdom teeth, I've been lucky with them so far
<Kandarihu> Er, a ban on me
<DocSane> Vordox: The US won't even sign on to the International Criminal Court.

<FillyFlam> This song <3
<Iron_Edge> Dat cosmic love
<Vordox> DocSane: We'll see....

<drbrony> sorry caps
<cachi01> drbrony: HECK YEAH
<DocSane> Vordox: Please name one instance where the UN has been able to affect anything without US troops to back it up?
<MrMaxaminus> Why are you guys even discussing this? Do you really think you're going to change the other persons mind? Come on.
<Litwick> I must know the name of this song. Now.
<FillyFlam> Litwick: This is Florence + The Machine, I think that's what they're called.
<Vordox> DocSane: Isn't that a bit...
<MegaMoonShine> Litwick: Cosmic Love by Florence and the Machine
<Elondras> ok im off for a while...i must that see...Denmark leads versus Netherlands...unbelievable
<FillyFlam> Litwick: Cosmic Love.
<alexxm> FillyFlam thats the band
<drbrony> anyone else laggign?
<Alchemist> the stars will her in her escape?
<alexxm> nope drbrony
<DocSane> Vordox: I'm saying the notion that the UN is some sort of all-powerful boogeyman is belied by even a casual glance at reality.
<Articuno> Thats very true, despite that I only had the two bottom ones removed XD it's free for us though
<Cyrus_123> thats it im breaking the fourth wall!
<Very_Silly_Filly> I hate my mother sometimes
<Cyrus_123> lol
<Iron_Edge> Twilight <3
<Cyrus_123> i hate my mother all the time
<MegaMoonShine> The stars will aid in her escape is the name of this pmv
<Vordox> DocSane: I'm more suprised that you validate UN's only reason of changing things are through military means...Quite hypocritical to me, even as a base.
<AppleEric> i love my mother all the time

<Angel_Espeon> 13:3
<Very_Silly_Filly> I was supposed to be going to my dads on THURSDAY, and not only did she delay it, she's cancelled the whole fucking trip altogether
<MrMaxaminus> The UN isn't competent enough to pull of some elaborate conspiracy. They don't have to. They have bombs.
<Articuno> I know this is probably TMI but for me, I had a bit of pain but the main problem was food always got caught in one as it was coming in sideways, it was extremely hard to dig it out.. and if I couldn't get to a bathroom soon enough, it would cause abscesses >v>
<Kandarihu> I'd appreciate if the documentary UN Me were streamed on here.
<Articuno> Lol nice thing to walk into Angel_Espeon XD
<cachi01> NO DOCUMENTARYS PLEASE
<Soital> 12LOL
<DocSane> MrMaxaminus: The UN has bombs?

<Cyrus_123> yes a lot
<AppleEric> can you imagine watching a documentary? BORING!
<DocSane> MrMaxaminus: Are you confusing the UN with NATO, because the UN has no military forces.

<Articuno> I heard them crack my tooth XD it was weird
<MrMaxaminus> Yeah you're right. I was being hyperbolic.
<Alchemist> there were the Jews, the media, the illuminati, the Bush registration, now the freaking UN is too part of a conspiracy? Come on...

<Staraptor> 2None of the Musketeers have grown on me
<Skylands> 10Reshiram, Zekrom, Kyurem are alright. Virizion and Cobalion sorta
<Chimera> I honestly only like Cobalion; Verizion maybe but it looks too silly

<Skylands> 10I mean, what is that thing even supposed to be?
<Biglaw> hello WallDives
<Articuno> I actually do dislike MLP as well, that is one of the reasons that Pokemon annoys me
<Articuno> but I can;'t stand the trio either
<cachi01> Dragonborn, Dragonborn,By his honor, is sworn, To keep evil forever at bay, And the fiercest foes rout,When they hear triumph's shout,Dragonborn, for your blessing we pray,And the Scrolls have foretold,Of black wings in the cold,That when brothers wage war come unfurled,Alduin bane of kings,Ancient shadow unbound,With a hunger to swallow the world.

<PONY> alexxm, lesson learned, these are horrible *nomnomnom*
<TheHouseholdWarrior> Sons of Gondor! Of Rohan! My brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowwolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the West!
<Hawkie> i notice that i no longer can keep up, eek!

<TheHouseholdWarrior> SO IT BEGINS
<Ponies47> YAY :)

<Kandarihu> Sumica: who now?
<Articuno> 12I hate all humanoid Pokemon
<Darf14> Derpy knows how to sleep upside down
<Meanwhile> Stream is fine. But I guess you could move the desktops onto the video player bar instead of the actual video.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Might take Derpy out if she's too distracting.
<hen3ry> Vordox: today. Is opposite day so people without "@" are now mods. unfortunately all commands broken
<Very_Silly_Filly> Okay, lemme rephrase: How gorey is this film?
<Aurora> 6pretty much that
<Hrafn> I think this movie does have a fair bit of gore and violence, but not extreme amounts from what I can remember
<Vordox> hen3ry: What a roundabout way...
<Hrafn> it's a great movie, though :3
<StinkomanFan> I'm getting flashbacks to The Master of Disguise :s

<PONY> how old is she again?
<Shizuka> 13restarted browser since then?
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: Natalie Portman's parents were extremely worried about the smoking scenes in the film, and before they allowed Natalie agree to appear, they worked out a contract with Luc Besson which had strict mandates as regards the depiction of smoking; there could only be five smoking scenes in the film, Portman would never be seen to inhale or exhale smoke, and Mathilda
<Silverscreen> 1,11would give up during the course of the film. If one watches the film closely, one can see that all of these mandates were rigidly adhered to; there are precisely five smoking scenes, Portman is never seen inhaling or drawing on a cigarette, nor is she ever seen exhaling smoke, and Mathilda does indeed give up during the course of the film.
<Thorn> RATS.

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: During the scene when Stansfield (Gary Oldman) 'interrogates' Mathilda's father (Michael Badalucco), Oldman smells the father, and gets extremely physically close to him. According to Badalucco, he had no idea that Oldman was going to smell him, nor that he was going to get as close as he did. Badalucco says that in the film, his look of discomfort during the scene
<Silverscreen> 1,11is completely genuine, as he felt decidedly intimidated by Oldman, and the physical proximity between the two made him very nervous.

At the time, he had already started working on The Fifth Element, but production was delayed due to Bruce Willis's schedule. Rather than dismiss the production team and lose his creative momentum, Besson wrote Léon. It took him only 30 days to write the script, and the shoot lasted only 90 days.

<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: According to Jean Reno, he decided to play Léon as if he were a little mentally slow and emotionally repressed.

<Silverscreen> 1,11such, during the scenes when such a relationship is discussed, Reno very much allowed Mathilda to be emotionally in control of the conversations.

Le Besco (who plays the blond prostitute in the opening scene) was engaged to writer/director at the time the film was made. Le Besco had met Besson when she was 11, and had fallen in love with him when she was 15 (Besson was 32 at the time).

<sergio_scriptor> hi TheStrategyGuy
<Ponies47> WHAT WHAT WHAT! :O
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: When the film was first tested in LA, the version that was screened incuded a short scene where Mathilda asks Léon to be her lover. However, the audience became extremely uncomfortable and began to laugh nervously, completely destroying the tone of the film. The film received terrible test scores at the screening, and as such, producer Patrice Ledoux and
<Silverscreen> 1,11writer/director Luc Besson decided to cut the scene for theatrical release.
<Bluestrom_S> seriously wtf
<StinkomanFan> OH GOD NO

<Very_Silly_Filly> Oooohh Yes
<Silverscreen> 1,11RANDOM MOVIE TRIVIA: The original script had more scenes with "awkward sexual tension" between Mathilda and Léon. These scenes were later cut out for the American release dubbed "The Professional", but were included in the 1996 European release, as well as in the deleted scenes of the special edition DVD. They were reintegrated back into the film for the 'International Cut', which is
<Silverscreen> 1,11now available on DVD.
