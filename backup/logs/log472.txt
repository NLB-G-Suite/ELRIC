<Canadian_Brony> send Fluttershy after him. She'll give him . . . The Stare
<Dark92Enigma> No emotion? That's an easy job for Matthew Broderick
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: ...still? none? hello? you dead? hes dead. GUYS RAWR IS DEAD.
<Kencolt> Red Bean and Yam? Sounds somewhat asian.
*Biglaw was being sarcastic
<RAWRity> I'm kind of hoping that Amon got the power to energybend from Koh
<panda> Sylandest: :D hiya
<cowvarkian> sounds good Kencolt
<otakon> FlareChaser: he is not dead

<Biglaw> RAWRity Lol!
<FlareChaser> RAWRity: Well, that left me severly depressed...
<otakon> kenne: ask RX-78-SweetieBot
<Sylandest> panda: im the same. I would drink some tea, but then I wouldn't sleep at all
<Kencolt> Sumica: I see. well, it's nice you have a job you like-- and is better to boot.
<Canadian_Brony> xmasskills Fluttershy will win anyway, admit it. A yellow pony is so much more of a boss

<Sumica> 00,10good choice for a B movie
<otakon> Sumica: why you have Luna too?
<SunderlandPony89> xmasskills: That'd be a big more advanced then they're capable of. The Fire Nation tropps just walked right into the city without a fight. Kinda not a good stragety
<FlareChaser> I think I might leave now :|

<CupcakeWarrior> Darkts3: That movie made enough to technically be an A movie
<Everlasting_Joy> Flail.
<RAWRity> I decide your ship.
<Kimori> what job would you be able to apply for when you finish?
<Kencolt> Definite lack of success.
<otakon> kenne: bc, RX-78-SweetieBot is more passionate about it.

<CupcakeWarrior> Well I stole your face

<Biglaw> dat stache
<RAWRity> Dark92Enigma: or Keannu Reaves
<SunderlandPony89> xmasskills: Maybe some kind of tunnel system between cities. That'd be pretty useful, actually :p
<BronysNations> add me on skype my name is bonnie heuer
<Dark92Enigma> Why so SERIOUS?
<Sylandest> Nittany_Discord: if you kho'd in reality, I would likely flip out...lol

<RAWRity> FlareChaser: and you take shit way too seriously.
<tehRequital> :S
<CupcakeWarrior> Its that monkey from Lion King?
<Dark92Enigma> RAWRity actually, he was my second choice LOL
<xmasskills> SunderlandPony89: i mean who is going to expect a military base to just pop out of no were and if the water tribe got the city underwater with the fire nation there everyone would die so the water nation has the advantage even if their city was overrun
*Canadian_Brony shivers
<Biglaw> RAWRity he may just be drunk
<kenne> otakon: well then i guess im going back to rock band then
<otakon> kenne: he's built for you, he regens health the more you kill enemies and he has a lunge Power Melee

<geeky-brony> SaxyPretender: lol
<DaringDude> true that
<RAWRity> The staple of a good action series is that you don't blow your load all at once. You've gotta have BUILDING action.
<MahBoi777> capes win wars

<otakon> Sumica: God, the first series was practically hard sci fi, bu this seems so.....cliche in comparison
<MahBoi777> geeky-brony: it's been proven lol
<Kandarihu> IMO, it wouldn't belong in the Gunbuster universe if time dilation weren't still an issue.
<geeky-brony> yes it has MahBoi777 yes it has
<Sumica> 00,10yeah they tossed the hard scifi out the window

<RAWRity> It's like how when you're makign sweet sweet love to somebody you love. You don't just pound your pelvises together for 30 minutes. YOu start slow, then gradually raise the pace, throw em for a flew loops on what you're gonna do, and then all of a sudden, they're not sure when it happened, but you're giving them the best sex of their life.

<MahBoi777> yeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaaaaaaaaw
<otakon> Sumica: wow, new record for Gainax, killing off the heroine in the first 15 minutes
<RAWRity> That's why the Transformers movies are such messes. They just THROW action at the screen without any buildup or tension, until eventually all the spectacle just stops really meaning anything to you.
<Om> Gator?
<CupcakeWarrior> BUSTAH GATOR
<CupcakeWarrior> Nah

<toplicious> and super strength
<otakon> THE HELL DID SHE SURVIVE THAT?!

*Nittany_Discord 11,01slaps Gunthler
<MahBoi777> ...
<RAWRity> Kencolt: Well to be fair, Excel Saga wasn't a show so much as it was an attempt to give TV cencors aneurisms.
<Kencolt> That's NOT what Topless means... Oh, why bother.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkler: you didn't watch Gunbuster did you?
<Storm_Chaser> Hello Everypony!
<twilight_sprinkler> otakon: nope.

<RainBowJack> indeed she became TOPLESS
<panda> wait
<panda> was she
<Om> What is that girl? Well, she is topless.
<panda> TOPLESS?
*Storm_Chaser is glomped and nuzzles MahBoi777 "Hey~"
<Gunthler> o__o
<Kandarihu> I was mildly optimistic that Gainax wouldn't make the "topless" thing literal.
<geeky-brony> that kind of joke
<otakon> Sumica: explain to twilight_sprinkler the significance of that scene please
*RainBowJack hugs MahBoi777
<Everlasting_Joy> I need to hit the hay folks.
*Gunthler liked dem bewbs. o_o
<Storm_Chaser> Hey Nittany_Discord and Everlasting_Joy how are you?
<RAWRity> Gainax has 3 staples: Robots, explosions, Bewbies
<otakon> Kandarihu: they did, it's alos a throw back to the first series
<Sumica> 00,10it was a throwback from gunbuster
<dishwasher_EXTREME> how the heck is she still breathing
<MahBoi777> gnigth Everlasting_Joy! sleep well
<twilight_sprinkler> Sumica: um, you dont have to. i was leaving anyway

<otakon> Sumica: they love their scooters don't they?
<toplicious> okay, so the "Topless" are members of something called a "Fraternity"
<RAWRity> Sumica: those aren't quite as prevalent.
<Kandarihu> So they kept in the parts that held it back, and threw out what made it great.
<twilight_sprinkler> lol toplicious
<Gunthler> toplicious: Whoo?
<geeky-brony> lolz
<CupcakeWarrior> dat plot
<RainBowJack> oohh THAT plot
<Gunthler> DAT NEKKID LADY
<twilight_sprinkler> yeeep, definitely not fanservice
<MahBoi777> lol
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't even think the original had fan service.
*Gunthler is getting way too excited over this...
<CupcakeWarrior> I liek nekkid ladies
<otakon> and THAT PREVIEW MUSIC!
<MahBoi777> oh myyyyyy
<RAWRity> Gainax's other Calling card is fantastic animation quickly followed by rushed, poorly budgeted animation.
<otakon> CupcakeWarrior: who doesn't?
<Kandarihu> As far as I'm concerned, the hard scifi is my kind of fanservice. The nipples are nothing but annoyances.
<otakon> RAWRity: yeah, that's true too.
<twilight_sprinkler> Kandarihu: but there is no hard scifi here
<CupcakeWarrior> otakon: Of course, I still like flat chests better
<DeadpoolDash> scifi with hard nipples
<twilight_sprinkler> lul
<geeky-brony> Kandarihu: i sorta agrre with you
<SaxyPretender> 0,14>Take On Me

<otakon> Kandarihu: well, Gunbuster was surprsingly hard scifi for being Gainax
<SaxyPretender> 0,14YESYESYESYES
<Steedius> Just yes.
<RAWRity> Because throughout all their years, Gainax still hasn't figured out hwo to properly budget their series.
<CrimsonPhoenix> oh god this video

<Steedius> This song. Haha.
<RainBowJack> best song ever from my childhood

<Kipkat07_USAF> K. Pyle?!!!
<pony_7807> lol
<MahBoi777> MERICA
<dentidiot> not like england fought or anything
<CrimsonPhoenix> Believe it or not but CoD was a legitimate good series before the modern warfare
<sub06905> next thing you know SuperBrony64 will be streaming MW3
<Kipkat07_USAF> This part makes me want to kill everyone
<cowvarkian> hmm
<MadSurge> Not "semper fi", "SEMPER PIE! PARTY OR DIE!"
<cowvarkian> thats fun Kipkat07_USAF
<CrimsonPhoenix> sub06905, oh don't worry, he will
<Gamer_Luna> Vordox,thanks for the tips!I'll try to inprove! Thanks SO much :)

<mario_pony> here's my voice http://vocaroo.com/i/s0ZbeiU1cAkC
<Vordox> These games never heard of "War Prisoners"?
<MahBoi777> whoa calm down Kipkat07_USAF
<Shizuka> 13hey look, it's the modern warfare guys!
<Pinkies4thWall> :O language
<dentidiot> pew pew time?
<sub06905> modern warfar 1945
<Shizuka> 13the player was useful!
<Kipkat07_USAF> MahBoi777: Dont tell me what to do you commie son of a bitch
<cowvarkian> ok
<dentidiot> brbr
<cowvarkian> if you say so
<MahBoi777> :/
<MadSurge> Shizuka: all soldiers look alike in these games, don't they? :D
<Gunthler> SuperBrony64: Are you playing on veteran difficulty??
<Kipkat07_USAF> SuperBrony64: save private ryan
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: it sounds so beautiful!
<Stormman3100> Kipkat07_USAF: 0_o
<Shizuka> 13at least price and gaz had a relationship you could sense
<Kipkat07_USAF> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<dentidiot> back
<Vordox> Shizuka: Never played any of the CoD games. It just felt like Medal of Honour all over again. D:
<SuperBrony64> 11,02HEART ATTACK
<Eddmario> Wow, haven't seen gameplay from this in a year or 2 now.
<cowvarkian> hey, Pinkies4thWall you're on borderlands right now, right
<Shizuka> 13so many of these "you are part of a squad" games do nothing to suggest the characters have spent more than five seconds with each other
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> this one is world at war ?
<Pinkies4thWall> cowvarkian: yes
<cowvarkian> mmk
<Vordox> Shizuka: Take a look at Bad COmpany. XD
<dentidiot> i dunno
<Kipkat07_USAF> SuperBrony64: Mission failed. protect Ryan failed. Restart from checkpoint
<Eddmario> the original Modern Warfare is the only CoD I'd be willing to play
<Stormman3100> I wish someone would make an exceptional World War 2 game.
<Eddmario> (unless my brother wants me to play multiplayer against him or zombies with him)
<Shizuka> 13see from what i can tell, right around modern warfare 1 was the last time any of these realistic shooters tried to give the player freedom
<Pinkies4thWall> cowvarkian: y?
<cowvarkian> just wondering
<Shizuka> 13they turned into marginally interactive movies from there
<Kipkat07_USAF> SuperBrony64: Pick up a M1 Garand ASAP
<Stormman3100> ^
<Eddmario> World at War: Minecraft Edition
<Gamer_Luna> Vordox,I tried once more! :$ It still might be crappy,but an inprovement :) http://vocaroo.com/i/s0gWlXVJuGsa
<dentidiot> i think the only fps ive played is goldeneye64 :D
<sub06905> BONZAI!
<Pinkies4thWall> cowvarkian: what's your tag?
<Stormman3100> All of these new FPS games resemble Halo so much its ridiculous
<Vordox> Gamer_Luna: All I hear is a "huuuuh"
<Eddmario> WTF was that Gamer_Luna?
<cowvarkian> Pinkies4thWall: you're on my friends list >.>
<Gamer_Luna> GOODNEESSS!
<Vordox> Stormman3100: All of these games resembles Duke NUkem 3D to me. XD
<geeky-brony> my joker imprshin http://vocaroo.com/i/s0lsxSp4KMTY it might suck
<cowvarkian> RvB Red Dude
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://i.imgur.com/tA6Ia.png and this everyone, is why Rarity is best pony
<Gamer_Luna> STUPID COMPUTER!
<Ponies47> WHOO WHOO! :P
<Stormman3100> Halo was such a boring series imo
<cowvarkian> geeky-brony: depends on which joker you're impersonating
<Shizuka> 13duke 3d at least takes you to interesting locations
<MahBoi777> I love halo
<Shizuka> 13like a prison or the post office
<CrimsonPhoenix> as well as Luna...and Mrs. Cake....and Granny Smith oh and Derpy too
<mario_pony> geeky-brony: :O
<Vordox> Yep, nto to mention, ROCKET PACK made it more awesome. :D
<Gamer_Luna> Eddmario,yes,that was me.I suck at singing -_-
<geeky-brony> lol
<sub06905> i prefer Goldeneye 64
<mario_pony> your voice is beautiful
<CrimsonPhoenix> Nothing beats DOOM
<Ponies47> Has never play Halo. :$ Please don't be mad at me :(
<Shizuka> 13and yeah it's duke so you go to strip clubs and such but there's still detail in that that makes it more interesting
<Ponies47> *played
<Kipkat07_USAF> Gamer_Luna: Yeah, what mario_pony said
<Vordox> Ponies47: We won't. it's an Xbox exclusive
<MahBoi777> Ponies47: I'm so mad! lol jk
*Shizuka 13likes her some duke 3d once a year or two
<Eddmario> CrimsonPheonix Correction: That proves that Luna is best pony
<Stormman3100> Ponies47: It isnt worth the try. Its just bad lol
<Gamer_Luna> I feel so warm inside :)
<Kipkat07_USAF> OH SHIT
<Vordox> Shizuka: You actually completed the game O.o
<dentidiot> thx ad
<dentidiot> blocking view
<CrimsonPhoenix> The first Halo was great
<Kipkat07_USAF> DIE TOJO!!!!!
<sub06905> Lets watch sum Duke Nukem Forever
<Shizuka> 13doom tried to do interesting locations but was more about just mowing down the demons
<CrimsonPhoenix> The second one had a great multiplayer
<Gunthler> Gamer_Luna: That is the power of BronyState. :3
*cowvarkian likes halo, but is a fanboy, so dont take his opinion for it
<Ponies47> Vordox: I have a PS3. Well it's my brothers. I really don't like video games :$
<Eddmario> get adblocker plus and noscript dentidiot
*Kipkat07_USAF gets over excietd and way to into war games
<CrimsonPhoenix> it degrade considerably from 3
<Shizuka> 13the community chest wads are great for doom 2 though, extremely high detail
<mario_pony> God I hate my voice :|
<Vordox> Shizuka: You got to admit, for leveldesignen, they are revolutionary on that. Atleas trying to give the enviroment identity.
<mario_pony> it sounds so mexican
<geeky-brony> a mix with Heath Ledger and mark hemaln
<MadSurge> Shizuka: a girl playing FPSes? More likely than you think. :)
<junh1024-XD> oi Hogia
<Shizuka> 13silly madsurge you have not seen my playtime on l4d1 and 2 :3
<Eddmario> I wanna see one of you guys do a stream of you trying out Steambot Chronicles for the PS2
<Kipkat07_USAF> mario_pony: youre voice doesnt sound like you smoke tho :P
<MahBoi777> mario_pony: lol don hate ur voice
<mario_pony> i wish i could get rid of my srupid accent
<mario_pony> *stupid
<junh1024-XD> Skyidle / Skylands also likes wubstep, so you can be wubstep buddies with her (when she's on)
<Shizuka> 13it's good for spatial reasoning and of course hand eye coordination
<MadSurge> Shizuka: I don't have neither :D but I love Doom
<Kipkat07_USAF> mario_pony: wat accent?

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Shizuka: :3

<Vordox> Gamer_Luna: But you know how to vibrato,that's a rare talent in singers.
<dentidiot> shizuka aposed to a kinect xD
<MahBoi777> oh no! they forgot to pack nachos!
<Shizuka> 13well kinect would be a rail shooter, which probably isn't far from what cod would rather be..
<Vordox> Gamer_Luna: Also, I did hear your breathe, when talking to the mic, you can have it sideways while you sing, it'll take out the puffs of sir, and make it sound better.
<Lightning_Zephyr> im playing this to so ima play Zombies in Der Riese

<junh1024-XD> they are, but they don't know it hurts because they're not being cut themselves
<junh1024-XD> also, scissors cost munny to replace
<Ghosties> 04It's the most tryharding of tryharding lately

<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> SuperBrony64|Zzz: Y U N O sleep?
<ScootaChicken> 'Swag, originally Australian slang for stolen goods'
<DeadpoolDash> swag used to be free stuff you got at events and get togethers I thought
<Ghosties> 04A stupid saying that's overused. People 90 per cent are dumb teenagers, 10 per cent are little ass kids trying to be cool use it for EVERYTHING and also as their facebook name thinking that shit's cute
<ScootaChicken> 'Swag, promotional items given away at trade fairs and events'
<cowvarkian> probably wasnt originally that ScootaChicken...
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> ScootaChicken: tis tru
<geeky-brony> swag= stupid white ass gangwanbe
<ScootaChicken> 'Swag (album), a 2002 album by former Guns N' Roses guitarist, Gilby Clarke'
<Ponies47> Ghosties: yeah I gotta agree :)
<ScootaChicken> I own that album.
<ScootaChicken> It sucks.
<Ninjazz> I first heard it from that Remix of Solja Boi's songs. I just thought that it was funny.
<BlueFlare> 02brb
<BlueFlare> 02foods
<cowvarkian> I always think of the word literally...
<BlueFlare> 02ლ(´ڡ`ლ)
<cowvarkian> so yeah
<Ghosties> 04I'm more hipster than hipsters, I swear
<Ghosties> 04I hate hipsters
<geeky-brony> Guns N Roses have the right to say that
<Hogia> 12IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND
<cowvarkian> hey...
<Ghosties> 04I hate everything, so I must be the ULTIMATE HIPSTER
<Hogia> 12god I used to say that all the time
<Ghosties> 04Actually, that's not true
<Ghosties> 04I <3 Katamari
*Ninjazz hums theme
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> geeky-brony: and others read the 3rd paragraph http://vampgyrl420.hubpages.com/hub/The-True-Meaning-Behind-Wearing-Your-Pants-on-the-Ground
<Hogia> 12I didnt even know what it meant
<DeadpoolDash> hipster's just didi it before it was mainstream
<Alicorn_Prince_Shane> di di di di di di digimon
<pony_6500> Ghosties: That's only because katamari is bucking spic
<Ghosties> 04What does it make you if you think everything is dumb and stupid?
<ScootaChicken> Ghosties likes Neitzche, so he can't be hipster. Neitzche is too mainstream.
<cowvarkian> A dumbass, Ghosties
<Tovler> I still need to figure out what hipster is.

<Sundaysmile> LOL
<Ninjazz> I don't know what the big deal is, I like the damn intro.
<Monfang> I was listening to it from when the show started. Still not used to it
<Litwick> Knickers not- aw forget it.
<Ninjazz> Get's you excited for all sorts of adventures and stuff.
<Giger4444> Monfang: then you are more resistant the the rest. But you WILL convert ;)
<Ninjazz> Giger4444: Don't be speaking like that...
<Monfang> Or maybe I know good intros?
<StinkomanFan> Doctor Whooves hates Apples

<Monfang> What has American done wrong?
<Monfang> 100% wrong?
<Ninjazz> Cause honestly, the world will fuck itself even without America around.
<Giger4444> No people, dont start this topic, it will turn into a flame war.
<Radu> ^
<RainBowJack> well bye everypony i have to go to my dad hes in the hospital bye bye
<Radu> Bye RainBowJack
<Ninjazz> You all just like blaming America cause we try the hardest.
<Monfang> Oh btw, they did a check to see how bad it would be if all the ice in the world melted. Honestly. NOt that bad.
<Ninjazz> But enough of that.
<Ninjazz> Cya RainBowJack!
<Litwick> Wait they made a black hole machine?
<StinkomanFan> For SCIENCE
<Monfang> Move a mile or two inland and you are at the new shore.
<prince-lemon> It's not a black hole machine.
<StinkomanFan> ^This
<Giger4444> Monfang: a few miles might be a great deal in places like New York
<blackpanzer15> it can happend
<StinkomanFan> ^
<prince-lemon> What people were implying could happen wasn't going to

<Litwick> :D
<Litwick> This chat is a gohst-town
<Monfang> WEll even if that's so, Giger. The advance of the water would be so gradual that people would have to be foolish not to get out of the way. and humans are so adaptive that we would move UP more than we would move inland.
<Radu> Dat funky-shit
<Yokupony> ponies!
<|Discord|> I am laughing to hard to type
<valoreins> ponies?
<Ninjazz> Dat Funky shit.
<StinkomanFan> :o
<Giger4444> Monfang: it wouldnt be the end of the world thats sure. It would just require a shit ton of money.
<StinkomanFan> OH GOD
<Ninjazz> lol
<Monfang> I doubt that. It would take a ton of 'get up off your butt and adapt'.
*CrazyCherry noms on Ninjazz's ear.

<Giger4444> Monfang: it would still require tremendous infrastrucutral reallocation/rebuilding etc, and thats a lot of money.
<Ninjazz> Now, stop nomming ears.
<StinkomanFan> Dat engrish
<Yokupony> higs?
*CrazyCherry hugs Ninjazz back syill nomming on his ear.
<Yokupony> hugs*
<Ninjazz> o\\\o

<Giger4444> Monfang: individuals bringing the electric cables of New York form under the ground for example? I doubt it.
<Monfang> Need some rope, wood and generators.
*Ninjazz imagives CrazyCherry doing a nope.avi while still trying to nom his ear and hug him at the same time
<Monfang> The electric cables would be in the buildings.
<StinkomanFan> He skipped 8
<Ninjazz> Imagives... Where did I come up with that one?
<Monfang> But I wonder... if you submerge electrical outlits, do they electirify the water?
<StinkomanFan> Heych

<Ninjazz> lol
<prince-lemon> Ooohh
<prince-lemon> That was more like it
<Giger4444> Monfang: of course, but the cables below ground wasnt desinged to withstand a flood so they will be faulty eventually. So they would be needed to be brought to the surface and thats no easy job.
<Ninjazz> Oh shit...
<WallDives> Ninjazz: I wondered. but she wants you, so...good luck.
<Ninjazz> :D
<Ninjazz> WallDives: Yeah... Lots of ponies been wanting me lately... :$
<Monfang> Again, we don't need the cables immediately.
<Giger4444> Monfang: but all this aside I agree that the water levels wouldnt cause an apocalypse.
<WallDives> Ninjazz: lol for you having a shipping value >0.
<blackpanzer15> 6_9
<Ninjazz> WallDives: Ikr...

<Ninjazz> Pegasus control weather. Fact.
<Ninjazz> Earth ponies...

<VioletGreySha> :3
<Gamer_Luna> Pegasus ALL THE WAY!
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: Controll the food xD
<Ninjazz> Airpuff: They make food. :S
<valoreins> for me, earth pony=strength, pegasus = agility, unicorn= wisdom, im not an athletic guy so i prefer unicorn
<WallDives> I officially has a new major. YAY.
<valoreins> :)
<Airpuff> Ninjazz: .. pretty much.. :s
<Ninjazz> On what, WallDives?
<WallDives> Ninjazz, school.
<pipsqueakthepirate> hard work and dedication, that's what drives the earth ponies, earth pony for major
<pipsqueakthepirate> (oh wait^^)
<Ninjazz> WallDives: I know that, I meant what is your new major.
<Gamer_Luna> Pegasus because flying seems awesome :)
<WallDives> Sport Leadership and Management.
<Ninjazz> Nice.
<Airpuff> Gamer_Luna: .. but unicorn's can levitate themselves o.o
<Magical_pablez94> Unicorns cause i love casting spells
<Airpuff> Gamer_Luna: and conjure wings
<pipsqueakthepirate> magic is cheating
*Magical_pablez94 teleports around da room
<valoreins> only lightweights can levitate themselves
<valoreins> to my theory
<Gamer_Luna> With a horn,but I don't want a horn.I don't like horns for some reason.
<Airpuff> valoreins: ..how do you explain twilight making a bubble and levitating all the manes at discord arc then? o.o
<Magical_pablez94> pipsqueakthepirate: magic is friendship...:D
<valoreins> because her talent is magic?
<WallDives> Airpuff: Magic?
<Magical_pablez94> Gamer_Luna: u lesbian :D
<pipsqueakthepirate> Magical_pablez94: wrong, friendship is magic
<valoreins> not all unicorns are master of all magic
<Gamer_Luna> NO
<Airpuff> WallDives: i know, but he said only lightweights could do it
<WallDives> pipsqueakthepirate: no, Fighting is Magic.
<ehm> Ninjazz: http://pastebin.com/RwYaxdut
<pipsqueakthepirate> WallDives: ugh, fighting, friendship, but mostly fighting, is magic
<pipsqueakthepirate> dont get picky with me!
<Gamer_Luna> BACON IS MAGIC
<valoreins> friendship is gic
<WallDives> pipsqueakthepirate: (its a game.)
<Ninjazz> Oh. Thanks ehm!
<pipsqueakthepirate> WallDives: (didnt catch that, duh)
<Ninjazz> Funny you remembered about that. :$
<Magical_pablez94> pipsqueakthepirate: if X=Y then Y=X... if friendship=magic then magic=friendship.
<pipsqueakthepirate> Magical_pablez94: this tree is made of wood
<pipsqueakthepirate> are all things made of wood now trees?
<pipsqueakthepirate> if all friendship is magic, that doesn't mean all magic is friendship
<Airpuff> Has saturn ever banned anyone? o.o
<Magical_pablez94> pipsqueakthepirate: actually they are. no more alive but they are. ur argument is invalid.

<Gamer_Luna> I wanna be the very best!
*VioletGreySha glomps SuperBrony64
<pipsqueakthepirate> Magical_pablez94: aren't bushes made of wood? plants?
<Magical_pablez94> Gamer_Luna: like no one never was ~
<pipsqueakthepirate> though to be fair, that wasn't the best of examples
<WallDives> Pokemon Conquest comes out later this month.
<Airpuff> Hai SuperBrony64 :P
<Gamer_Luna> To catch them is my real test
<Magical_pablez94> pipsqueakthepirate: pipsqueakthepirate: btw it was a joke, man.
<pipsqueakthepirate> no, jokes are not allowed here
<pipsqueakthepirate> shame on you!
<Magical_pablez94> Gamer_Luna: to train them is my cause!!! ~
<Gamer_Luna> I will traval across the land!
<pipsqueakthepirate> god I love this song
<Rikku379> pipsqueakthepirate : what do you mean no jokes
<Gamer_Luna> searhing far and wide
<Magical_pablez94> Gamer_Luna: searching far and wide ~
<pipsqueakthepirate> Rikku379: jokes are only for the older ponies
<Gamer_Luna> POKEMON
<Giger4444> I feel like a freak. I never watched the Pokemon series and I never played any game (video or cardgame) related to it.
<SilverSonic> ohai Shineh~
<Magical_pablez94> Gamer_Luna: the pok[mon to understand
<pipsqueakthepirate> i've played too much and seen to much pokemon
<Giger4444> It seems everyone else did.
<pipsqueakthepirate> realised fast it's all the same, all the same
<Magical_pablez94> è*
<Gamer_Luna> POKEMON
<WallDives> Giger4444: I havenseen the anime, if it makes you feel betetr.
<Rikku379> Hear that joke about michel bay being an dumbass, it's not a joke
<WallDives> just the promo tape from NP.
<Magical_pablez94> Gamer_Luna: u missed a line:D
<pipsqueakthepirate> Pokemon red, blue and yellow were the best
<pipsqueakthepirate> to be fair
<Airpuff> Who's streaming?
<Giger4444> WallDives: but you played the game I presume? :)
<Gamer_Luna> I don't lnow the whole song :$

<WallDives> Giger4444: I have, and read the manga.
<Airpuff> prince-lemon: Can you watch some standup from Dane cook afterwards? The sneezing atheist? x
<Giger4444> WallDives: See? Im a freak! :D
*SuperBrony64 hugs VioletGreySha back :3
<pipsqueakthepirate> WallDives: I'm not saying the rest are bad, oh no, I've played plenty of silver, gold, and some older ones.... but they're just all so alike. THey really improved so little on it
<WallDives> I mean, RBY competitively is a notorious crapshoot.
*Magical_pablez94 sings for Gamer_Luna "i wanna be the very best like no one never was... to catch them is my real testto train them is my cause!"
<WallDives> pipsqueakthepirate: after gen 3, there isnt much TO improve on, outside of newer/better movesets.
*Magical_pablez94 "i'll travell across the land seacrhing far and wide... teh pokèmon to understand the power that's inside!"
<WallDives> but Gen 5's story is actually pretty good, for pokemon.
<WallDives> imo.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Magical_pablez94: Kony's theme song?
<Magical_pablez94> SuperBrony64: kony's?

<WallDives> MadSurge, I have to take certain medicine that "taints" it.
<Ninjazz> UH Huh Huh Huh Huh/
<Ninjazz> I'm squemish as hell when it comes around to blood.
<MadSurge> WallDives: that sucks. I should go and see if I can.
<Sundaysmile> eat oranges, gain blood
<Rikku379> Bleed
<Ninjazz> I can handle gore but when you start getting needles out and stuff, I just feel like i'm about to faint.
<valoreins> so... vampires should eat more oranges...
<MadSurge> It's the opposite for me Ninjazz, needles only mildly concern me but any realistic/real gore makes me yelp like a kid :(
<Sundaysmile> lol
<Gamer_Luna> I'm a violence/gore artis. :)
<Ninjazz> MadSurge: If you play the stuff I've played, you just get desensitized.
<Gamer_Luna> ARTIST
<Ninjazz> But needles... *shudders*
<WallDives> ohai Om.
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: I can play/see any fake gore, but real blood... *shudders*
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: have you played Splatterhouse? :$
<valoreins> real blood, well i sometime help my mom in the kitchen :D
<Ninjazz> MadSurge: Nope. But I have seen it. HOLY CRAP.
<Om> WallDives: Hi
<Ninjazz> Hey Om!
<Om> sup Ninjazz
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: all the games in the series are pretty fun to play, and the gore makes for a nice horror theme
<Ninjazz> MadSurge: Not so much horror, more so like action feel.
<Ninjazz> Om: How you been? :)

<Neo-Changling-Ridley> Yea my sister is a idiot
<Malavolent> alexxm: Aww, too bad.
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Gamer_Luna> Girls play sports and video games with no one caring.

<Vordox> Malavolent: You have Extend? =3
<alexxm> i tend to stick as bang Malavolent
<Ninjazz> Neo-Changling-Ridley: She is clearly ignorant.
<Malavolent> Vordox: Unfortunately, not. :(
<Ninjazz> In the most formal sense of the word.
<Neo-Changling-Ridley> Yea she is quite the ignorant bitch
<Neo-Changling-Ridley> she thinks she can do what ever she wants
<Malavolent> I prefer Ragna as I sympatize with him.
<Malavolent> But I want to learn Rachel.
<Ninjazz> Sounds like a regular "princess" to me.
<Om> What would you know about princess's
<Neo-Changling-Ridley> Well lets see..i have a list of things she's done
<Gamer_Luna> Magical_pablez94 ,I know.I hate that that's so unfair.I disagree what that,it's horriable
<Neo-Changling-Ridley> she's carved holes in the walls
<FlareChaser> UGH, this juice sucks balls.
<Neo-Changling-Ridley> she's cut up bed sheets
<Ninjazz> Om: I have a cousin that thinks she can do what ever he heart desires and get who ever she wants to do something... somethinh she wants.
<Ninjazz> her*
<Magical_pablez94> Gamer_Luna: mah... damned society... the only thing to do is IGNORE. and that's what i actually do.
<Shiny-Growlithe> 02ra
<Malavolent> Ninjazz: Gotta love these people.
<Neo-Changling-Ridley> and she painted her furnature
<Om> Those are the funnest ones to mess with.
<Ninjazz> Malavolent: I do love these people/ponies.
<Ninjazz> Om: Aye. But then she cries to my mother and then everything becomes un worth it.
<Ninjazz> -_-
<Neo-Changling-Ridley> Also you know what sucks Ninjazz ?
<Gamer_Luna> Magical_pablez94 ,Love and tolerance by fellow pony :)
<Ninjazz> Hmmm?
