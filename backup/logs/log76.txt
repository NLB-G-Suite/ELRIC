<BobJoeBillBo> IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FALTERING TO ME.
<Tigerflame> where was i?
<Jon> cause his kids have not changed at all
<Ghosties> Explain that shit to me, because I just invested two and a half hours of my life in this film and I want some goddamn answers
<Silverscreen> 11OKAY, EXPLINATION
<Silverscreen> 11And I muted the channel so it won't vanish in a second
<Ghosties> 4<Ghosties>: Explain that shit to me, because I just invested two and a half hours of my life in this film and I want some goddamn answers
<NewDCD> 9Canonically, it actually fell. So yeah.
<Silverscreen> 11The adventure itself wasn't a dream, as the top fell durring the other parts of the movie.
<Silverscreen> 11Just the ending is a dream.
<NewDCD> 9OBJECTION!
<Ghosties> 4...what?
<Flutterpeanut> 13 42
<Silverscreen> 11what, DCD?
<NewDCD> 9The ending wasn't a dream, and such was stated in an interview with Alfred's actor.
<Silverscreen> 11That's the actor, not the ending product or the director.
<NewDCD> 9Canonically, the totem fell
<Ghosties> 4I don't know if I can sit through this movie again
<NewDCD> 9but they decided to cut it before it did
<Hipster_Brony> 8>implying the ending isnt open to interpretation
<lossthief> 0Really, there's no real point to arguing the ending. It was meant to be ambiguous
<Denied_Existence> Silverscreen OR IS IT!? We may never know...
<light> the ending simply means he finally acheived his dream, he must be dreaming
<NewDCD> 9because it was more fun to do so
<LightRook> I disagree on that. The movie doesn't show the top falling, but it leaves the possibility that it might.
<SirReginaldPonyworthIII> MiMichael Caine is the actor.
<sklar> Ghosties actually it takes place in the abestergo facility and Leonardo is actually subject 16
<Broonsbane> yeah
<DSNesmith1> YOU'RE KILLING US MODS
<Tyranico> I'm leaving guys! G'night! ^_^
<desertman2> HEY!
<RanYakumo> The top still spinning is simple symbolism to represent that his dream finally came true.
<Dman> What hipster_brony said!
<df1337> CREDICEPTION
<Apple_Bloom> Oh God yes
<timmymonsta> I think straight can't now
<nah> hey hold on
<RanYakumo> Ghosties The top still spinning is simple symbolism to represent that his dream finally came true.
<DragonRage> Guys, guys, seriously.
<ASFLEADER> IVE SPOKEN 8 LINES, YET NO ONE ELSE HAS SAY ANYTHING
<DSNesmith1> top falls
<FritzTheCat> BULLSHOT! COBB isn't that good of an architect that he could create France and Kenya and Japan and Shit.
<Apple_Bloom> That
<Jon> Unless theres another movie
<Apple_Bloom> Mind
<Broonsbane> the top does begin to fall just before it cut
<Silverscreen> 11The only question I have is...DID SAITO GET OUT OF THE DREAM OR NOT?!
<mib_keoqac> the top isn't even the totem though, it's his wedding ring iirc
<EmmettBrown> I thought the ending is deliberately left ambiguous
<Tigerflame> G'night
<DragonRage> She picked the door with the tiger.
<Stabbercube> SO MUCH BASS
<Apple_Bloom> = blown
<Rainbow_Derp> so he has not been gone that long?
<GGgala> Your concept of 'canon' is strange and oddly constricting
<WF_Chronicles> 0guys, i know that you dislike youtube links, but it's important you hear this
<DragonRage> Obviously.
<Knil_Adlez> is this the real life, is it just fantasy
<WF_Chronicles> 0http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVkQ0C4qDvM
<Stabbercube> I LOVE IT
<Dashite_Alt> RanYakumo genius!
<Jon> Both versions of the Debate are canon
<mib_yorop1> SO WHATS NEXT?
<ponies> Guys, I have a very controversial intepretation:
<Reaver21> It's a TRAP!
<durger> Did I miss the Tomatoes?
<Daxton> They had it story borded where the totem fell
<nah> bluh
<mib_o30n5p> i say it fell
<DSNesmith1> silverscreen, yes he did
<ponies> I liked it
<Dman> silverscreen - u decie
<WF_Chronicles> 0it's awesome
<ASFLEADER> TRUELY A MINDFUCK
<techdude300> Oh i get it
<BobJoeBillBo> The top was faltering, wasn't it?
<Dman> wf_chronicles no vid links
<lossthief> 0silverscreen yes he did, we see him out of it in the end
<RainbowDash> Tech
<Ghosties> 4Fuck this shit, I'm about ready to just go to sleep
<FlamingBooger> GOODDAMMIT MY INTERNET CUT OUT RIGHT BEFORE THE END
<SirReginaldPonyworthIII> He had to, or else Cobb would've been arrested.
<RainbowDash> Tech Dude :o
<Ghosties> 4THAT'S RIGHT, I SAID SLEEP
<Jon> It was tilting
<mib_q1npi6> yay credits.
<mib_782n2z> in a dream, my totem will be a gyrobowl
<Broonsbane> once the top were to start wobbling it would eventually fall down
<DSNesmith1> lol @ghosties rage
<GabeMoist> Brony Movie Night is in a dream I am in
<nah> look in cobb's dreams he's still married to his wife, so he's always wearing the ring
<TGPFluttershy> Open interpretation. That is all
<lossthief> 0unless it was all a dream, then who knows
<Colt_Phelps> Saito must have gotten out, because he was awake on the plane just before the ending scene.
<Stabbercube> Sleep?
<Sathi> WAT!
<Silverscreen> 11RANDOM RUNTIME TRIVIACEPTION: The running time of 2 hours 28 min is a reference to the original length of Édith Piaf's song "Non, je ne regrette rien", which lasts (on its first recorded edition) 2 minutes 28 seconds.
<WF_Chronicles> 0so guys. what did you thing
<Stabbercube> What is that?
<Combustiblelemons> Me too ghosties
<Reaver21> MY BRAINZ ARE HURTING.

<GabeMoist> None of you exist
<mib_q1npi6> You're already asleep ghosties.

<techdude300> Permission to post a link?
<Dman> DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN
<Sathi> 7I should sleep..
<WF_Chronicles> 0WHat did you think*
<TheQuestionMark> Guys I have an idea, WHAT IF, THE BEGINNING WAS A FLASH FORWARD AND NOT A FLASHBACK? THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE SINCE THE ENDING IS A DREAD RIGHT?
<Lukem1999> So what's next?
<Hipster_Brony> 8brb
<Rainbowfox> What we really need to know is: Does Hans Zimmer think it's a dream?
<Colt_Phelps> If Saito didn't wake up, Cobb couldn't get into the States.
<Broseph> The ending is up for speculation. It's part of the beauty of the movie.
<Sathi> 7it's 5:30!
<GamerGodJones> GUISE WE NEED TO WHISPER SO THE MODS EARS DONT GET HURT

<RainbowDash> Ohai TechDude
<Reaver21> gahh!!! MY MIND.
<Stabbercube> So what vid is next?
<Ghosties> 4And unspoken rule
<mib_o30n5p> LETS KEEP THE PEACE AND EVEYONE JUST BELEVE WHAT THEY WANT
<NightFurson> I figured the end WAS ambiguous, and the top was faltering, but wasn't shown falling. "Was or was it not a dream?"
<Aponymous> THIS IS JUST LIKE THE END OF BLADE RUNNER WHERE THEY DON'T *EXPLICITLY* STATE WHETHER OR NOT DECKARD WAS A REPLICANT. IT"S SUPPOSED TO BE AMBIGUOUS> CAPS LOCCK FOR ATTENTION.
<Apple_Bloom> Oh crap
<Combustiblelemons> I'm giving in to sleep

<TGPFluttershy> SPOILER: The next movie contains no pickles

<UncleOrange> 6
<FluxBrony> Goodnight everpony
<Ekowulf8OO> Ciao o;
<Jon> 512489
<UncleOrange> YOU WILL NEVER BREAK MY CODE!!
<Reaver21> I BROKE IT, U MAD?
<Darf14> I will figure it out Mr Orange....EVENTUALLY!
<Dermathil> who wants to see Gurren Lagann?
<UncleOrange> what is it then?
<Darf14> *raises hand*
<Reaver21> GURREN LAGANNN
<Reaver21> Your code? IT IS DELICIOUS WITH JELLY.
<Sumica> But I have already seen it.
<Reaver21> Naw it ain't.
<ponYthink> 528491
<Reaver21> Lol, still stuck on inception?
<Darf14> I figure it our and it says..."Did you know that Rarity is the best Pony?".......dang I disagree with that secret code.
<Reaver21> Code? I only like codes that have jelly.
<Jon> Rarity?
<Jon> Someone needs to spell better.
<FreezeFrame> Nope, they spelled it just fine.
<Darf14> I have a feeling that I made a mistake with my spelling.....AGAIN!
<Jon> It should be "Did you know that Fluttershy is the best Pony?"Then it would be right.
<ponYthink> Hmm, if nopony says anything, then everypony will LEAVE HAHAHA. I WILL BE VICTORIOUS!!!
<Darf14> yeah but it wasn't my code, it was Mr Oranges code
<Sumica> 42 seems like a good amount to me.
<Darf14> 42? That proves it, its the answer to the universe!
<Jon> We've dropped 2
<Jon> and 2 more
<Dermathil> DARI
<Dermathil> ARE YOU HERE
<FritzTheCat> 38? I'd better leave so we can get closer to Rule 34.
<Darf14> Three more to 34

<Sumica> lol
<Apple_Bloom> Indee
<Apple_Bloom> Best movie night ever
<Darf14> wait...I am cool....I must be doing something wrong
<Sumica> so yeah synctube people are disterbing.
<Jon> I'm scared of them...
<Apple_Bloom> So how are things in the world of bronies.
<Bashfluff> Only Filly2
<Apple_Bloom> Loving and tolerating I hope
<Dermathil> we need someone to stream Gurren Lagann somewhere.
<Dermathil> maybe I could make a livestream room to put the episodes up...
<Bashfluff> Mojo did a Gurren Lagann night a month or so ago.
<Bashfluff> All the eps are on youtube.
<Darf14> @Aooke_Bloom Lets see.....one major thing is that we got recognition from Colbert
<Dermathil> (I know about the youtube eps)
<Bashfluff> So that was fun/
<Darf14> Oops I mean Apple_Bloom sorry that I spell your name wrong
<Bashfluff> Wow, someone did A Series of Unfortunate Events parody with the CMCs.

<Apple_Bloom> Guy love
<sotha> Oh Sumica, I hope your feelings for certain characters in FiM are not tarnished by this.
<Jon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJwgAflY9tg
<EmmettBrown> I might go and try to finish reading the Pony world of warcraft fic or the one where they go and relive the memories of their ancestors.I forget their names.
<sotha> Good luck.
<Apple_Bloom> Mods are asleep
<Apple_Bloom> Post ponies
<Apple_Bloom> Believe me I am a trained sadness reader
<Sumica> I have been to 4chan, little phases me any more.
<Apple_Bloom> I have been to the depths of /b/ and back
<EmmettBrown> Watching that video you posted.An ad for nude furniture fitting came up
<Darf14> ................POOR PINKIE :(
<Apple_Bloom> Reading
<Bashfluff> Yeah, and that's my favorite Scrubs episode, so that pissed me right off.
<Bashfluff> I'm readin' a fic, pig, I'm readin' a fic. Don't you ever interupt me while I'm readin' a fic.
<Sumica> oh look i dont have to read it, people have done readings of it.
<Thetrollside> awww no after show?
<Sumica> this is the aftershow.
<ponYthink> SONIC RAINBOOM ON SYNCHTUBE
<Thetrollside> quite dead
<Darf14> It sure is dead here, at least that explains the skeleton to my right
<Dermathil> Not really
<Dermathil> Just watching Gurren Lagann, alone.
<Jon> ...What dead hookers?
<Sumica> so that's what it was all about? I must say I am disapoint.
<Darf14> alone you say: http://troll.me/images/forever-alone-20/forever-alone.jpg
<Jon> ...How do we have a few more people now?
<Cirrus> what up yo
<Jon> Hi
<Sumica> idleing boredom.
<Darf14> well....since no one has nothing on their mind's I might a well say goodbye, see you Bronies tomorrow.
<Jon> See you all tomorrow
<Dermathil> >mfw I discussed Gurren Lagann for the last 4 hours with someone else and now I see a forever alone pic
<Nittany_Tiger> And chat is now slowly draining.
<Nittany_Tiger> Or has been.
<Sumica> verry slowly.
<Dermathil> R34 chat
<TooBrony> si
<Dermathil> hey Dari, you still here?
<Polarfire> Dari has been gone a long time now I think
<Dermathil> darniy
<Dermathil> *darnit
<Sumica> time to go ptfo. Catch you all later.
<sotha> bye
<Dermathil> hey sotha
<sotha> hey
<sotha> Dermathil
<sotha> What's going on?
<Dermathil> nothing really
<mib_8877s4> Why is there nothing on?
<Dermathil> No streamer is currently around?
<mib_8877s4> Ah
<sotha> slow chat right now
<mib_8877s4> So, I missed it? 4 hours late
<sotha> Yeah.
<sotha> It was slow starting up do to technical difficulties, so even though I was a half hour late, I managed to catch both pony episodes, which were played first, as well as almost all of Inception.
<sotha> Unfortunately, I missed everything after that (i.e. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes)
<sotha> I do not know if there was any sort of an aftershow, but if appears not.
<Nittany_Tiger> There wasn't.
<sotha> That makes sotha sad.
<sotha> But she does have like 50 billion posts to catch up on in EqD, so it isn't all bad.
<FreezeFrame> There was not, as DCD was tired
<FreezeFrame> There should be one for Saturday's showing
<sotha> Hum. . . I hope I'll be able to make Saturday's showing. I would like to see the Tomato movie after all. How did y'all like it?
<FreezeFrame> sotha: glorious, glorious cheese
<FreezeFrame> It's a 1978 parody of B "giant menace" movies
<Nittany_Tiger> Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was full of lulz.
<sotha> cool
<sotha> Say, I think I'm out for the night. I was enjoyable conversing with you all. And watching movies....So good night (or good morning).
<Polarfire> anybody left?
<Nittany_Tiger> Me, but I'm just about to go.
<Polarfire> aww
<Nittany_Tiger> I'll be back tomorrow.

<Dman> everybrony asleep?
<prince-dari> Nah, I just got back.
<Dman> HEY!
<Dman> prince-dari yo
<Dman> I actually wanted to talk to a mod about just a little something
<prince-dari> Yes?
<Dman> NewDCD linked to a website testing upload speed and specified minimum speed for streaming - my upload speed is plenty
<Dman> I just wanted to make this known, so as to not send a second email
<Dman> Aside from that, were you here for the movie night?
<prince-dari> Nope.
<prince-dari> I was at a party.
<Dman> Ah, well how was the party?
<prince-dari> It was good.
<Dman> That's nice~ anything particular happen though?
<prince-dari> ...Not really sure what question you're asking there. ;)
<Dman> Did anyone do anything sillee?
<Dman> what was the party? brithday party? Just generally asking about the party really
<Dman> Seeing as nooneelse is here, may aswell ask about that :P
<prince-dari> It was just a party. :P
<prince-dari> A party party.
<Dman> A PARTEY
<Dman> Well ok then
<Dman> uh, so, um, any plans for today? and did you sleep tonight or stay up
<prince-dari> Today I'll probably leave for Wales to go climb Snowdon.
<Dman> :O
<Dman> yay!
<prince-dari> Stay overnight and climb it on Sunday.
<Dman> Woohoo!
<Dman> that's gonna be so awesum
<prince-dari> Eeyup, should be fun.
<Steven_Magnet> 12,7Hail Steve, the fabled Englushmen *Awesomesauce*
<Dman> Oh, I showed Dermathil one episode of Gurren Lagann - he proceeded to mute the stream and watch about 10 episodes instead :D
<prince-dari> Hahaha.
<Dman> I just looked in the mirror and I have bloodshot eyes
<Dman> Guess that happens when going to bed at 8am and waking up at 11am for about a week straight :D
<prince-dari> Bloodshot eyes - symptom of watching the BMN stream in the EU.
<Dman> :D
<Dman> Don't know if I can come to today's : /
<Dman> Are you gonna be travelling to wales aniway?
<Dman> during the stream?
<prince-dari> Probably.
<Dman> Ah well
<Dman> Hey, the EQD bot didn't work yesterday
<Articuno> 12BLAAAH
<Ascendant> o-o?
<Articuno> 12it's still really hard to tell them apart
<Ascendant> sec
<Dman> and sofa so good was posted about 30 minutes ago for me : /
<Articuno> 12I really want to use the HGSS ones, they're awesome
<Ascendant> yeah it is
<prince-dari> MLP, bigger news than terrorism.
<Ascendant> Well, use them then :p
<prince-dari> Winning. :>
<Articuno> 12Yeh but isn't Shiny one of the biggest Ho-oh theme fans >v>
<Ascendant> Derpy Ho-Oh/Ho-Oh54 and Shiny are I think
<Articuno> 12Why the hell does NO ONE have animated BW sprites?
<Ascendant> no idea
<prince-dari> Yeah, because I DCed.
<Ascendant> what do the BW sprites look like?
<Ascendant> I'll look for some
<prince-dari> So I had to restart the timer.
<Articuno> 12http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/0/0a/Spr_5b_250.png
<prince-dari> I'll have it set up automatically some time.
<Articuno> 12:/
<Articuno> 12Now I remember why I didn't use BW sprites....
<Articuno> 12http://imgboot.com/images/aragornbird/250.gif
<Ascendant> http://pldh.net/dex/sprites/hooh
<Ascendant> oh
<Articuno> 12yeh, it's horrible
<Ascendant> ew
<Dman> Oh i see, well if you already knew that's alright then
<Ascendant> I have the PMD sprite somewhere
<Articuno> 12I absolutely HATE Lugia's animation in BW >v>
<Articuno> 12Cool ovo
<Articuno> 12Might be too small though
<Ascendant> Also, this is like, the best Ho-oh sprite ever
<Ascendant> it's small so don't use it :p
<Ascendant> http://i26.tinypic.com/3026y34.jpg
<Articuno> 12Cute XD
<Ascendant> I'm just like <3!
<Ascendant> and PMD sprite is about the size of the RSE ones I think
<Ascendant> let me find it first xD
<Articuno> 12k
<Ascendant> it's 55 x 59 I think, dunno where the hell it is
<Articuno> 12Small
<Ascendant> yeah
<Articuno> 12Do you not like the HGSS ones either?
<Ascendant> I don't hate them but I don't like them the most either
<Articuno> 12Bleh
<Ascendant> better than the GSC ones
<Articuno> 12I absolutely can't stand the diamond ones XD
<Articuno> 12Hmm
<Ascendant> it's your choice
<Articuno> 12Anyone else got a say in this?
*Ascendant slaps Drake
*Drake is slapped
<Drake> 04What?
<Drake> 04Whatever you do, don't use B/W sprites.
<Drake> 04They're horrible.
<Drake> 04At least for Ho-Oh
<Drake> 04And unless you're going to make a Deino/Zweilous/Hydreigon theme anytime soon, I'd recommend against using any animation from past generations that doesn't use a completely new sprite.
<Articuno> 12Lol
<Articuno> 12You haven't said what you actually want >v>
<lightumbreon> 06i found my games on the drive! games from 5 year old!
<Articuno> 12Ffs Angry Birds wont play on my phone >v>
<lightumbreon> 06android or apple?
<Articuno> 12Can't wait for my Galaxy S2 to arrive..
<Articuno> 12I use Android ONLY
<Drake> 04Honeslty Arti, I don't mind which one you use as long as it's not the B/W ones.
<Drake> 04Honestly*
<Articuno> 12So you like the HGSS ones?
<Articuno> 12and lol trust me I hate the BW ones too >v>
<lightumbreon> 06i see, weird that it doesnt play it on android .-.
<Articuno> 12It's not the OS thats the problem lightumbreon
<Articuno> 12it's the phone, it's two years old
<lightumbreon> 06whats kind of phone?
<Articuno> 12It's a HTC Magic
<lightumbreon> 06HTC? hm... HTC with android is hell better as with Windows Mobile xD
<Articuno> 12lol yeh but it's two years old now
<Articuno> 12It ran fine on the old version of Anroid but after it updated itself, it became the slowest phone in the world, can';t handle new OS
<Articuno> 12Sucks
<Articuno> 12It;s been like this for like a year now :(
<Articuno> 12and no one seems to know a way to downgrade!
<lightumbreon> 06ew...
<eXAKR> An Articuno
<Ascendant> Drake why did I realise that PMD2 also somewhat focuses on criminals and outlaws?
<Ascendant> I suck
<eXAKR> Articuno: iPhone 3G users share your pain
<Drake> 04XD
*Drake hugs NS
*Ascendant hugs back
<eXAKR> Except that we can sorta downgrade
<Drake> 04That's exactly like you
<Ascendant> XD
<Ascendant> hey, you know I have random stuff to say
<eXAKR> I don't though
<Ascendant> on the topic of criminals and outlaws
<Drake> 04Of course.
<Ascendant> XD
<Drake> 04Ignoring your many stories about laws and criminals...and black/grey morality.
<Drake> 04Sheesh, it's all you dpo
<Drake> 04do*
<lightumbreon> 06PMD 2 is my all time favourite PKMN game
<lightumbreon> 06it's awesome :3
<Ascendant> rofl
<Articuno> 12Ok done with sprites, they look SO much better now
<Ascendant> nice :p
<Ascendant> Shiny's probably going to come complaining though
<Ascendant> Just warning you :p
<Articuno> 12Tell him to animate the diamond/pearl ones properly then :>
<Drake> 04XD
<Articuno> 12or find someone who can
<lightumbreon> 06WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT, if this is the OLD harddisk i'm usin...and everything is still on it...
<lightumbreon> 06crap
<Drake> 04They should make a Ho-Oh sprite similar to the Gold version one, instead of re-using the 'spread wings' pose every single generation.
<lightumbreon> 06so are the virusses!
<Drake> 04ohshi
*lightumbreon goes to scan >.<;
<Articuno> 12I know it's SO annoying.....
<Ascendant> It's not the spread wings thing
<Ascendant> it's the legs
<Articuno> 12They change every other sprite EXCEPT Ho-ohs
<Drake> 04Ok
<Articuno> 12lol the legs were only weird in HGSS ovo
<Ascendant> bloody hell, the HGSS one looks like it's doing the splits
<Articuno> 12and even then they're not that bad
<Drake> 04this is gonna be a reeeeeeally crude joke but...
<prince-dari> Why don't you have a poll or something about the sprites?
<Ascendant> which is why I don't like them
<Ascendant> and why Shiny hates them
<Articuno> 12My canary does that all the time with his legs XD
<Drake> 04Ho-Oh: "Hey guys, can you smell fish?"
*Drake FLEES
<lightumbreon> 06LMAO
<Articuno> 12prince-dari, because I am impatient and can't be bothered to wait for an answer that long >v<
<Articuno> 12Why did you have to make that joke? :/
<Ascendant> and yes, they don't change Ho-Oh's sprite
<Ascendant> and lol
<Drake> 04I just spent three days in a row with no one but other male adolescents.
*Ascendant has a thought
<Drake> 04Don't judge me.
<Ascendant> I wonder if I can put a theme switcher on my profile...?
<Articuno> 12LOL that would be cool
<Articuno> 12Though
<Articuno> 12The profiles don't do javascript (just remembered)
<eXAKR> Oh that's just me
<eXAKR> Ignore that
<eXAKR> And hi prince-dari
<Drake> 04It'd be pretty cool if they did.
<prince-dari> Hey.
<lightumbreon> 06what script do they do then?
<eXAKR> (we know each other from another chat)
<Articuno> 12Only CSS and formatting stuff
<prince-dari> You got any pony toys yet?
<Ascendant> I swear it does do JS
<Articuno> 12lol it'd be a major security risk
<lightumbreon> 06ouch
<Articuno> 12I remember someomne saying they tried it and it didn;t
<Articuno> 12But try
<Ascendant> iirc I was able to link to my snowflakes script
<Ascendant> it only accepts some js
<Ascendant> not all
<Ascendant> it's like what it does with HML
<eXAKR> Other than the McDonald's ones, no
<Ascendant> won't accept <link> though, which is what the theme switcher does
<Articuno> 12Oh right XD
<FallSilently> http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/Toys.jpg
<Articuno> 12Ok
<prince-dari> McDonald's toys STILL haven't come here.
<Ascendant> ...uses
<lightumbreon> 06OHSHI-
<Drake> 04?
<Articuno> 12Also
<eXAKR> .
<lightumbreon> 06virus scanner went ape just now
<Drake> 04Uh oh
<lightumbreon> 06scanning the older drive i just installed
<FallSilently> Where's "here?"
<Articuno> 12I tried to get Lugia to help me yesterday but he had to stay behind at work for hours and then only had like an hour to talk >v>
<prince-dari> UK
<prince-dari> England
<eXAKR> The other G4 toys have starteds coming in here in Singapore as well
<Articuno> 12The latest visitors are REALLY annoying me....
<FallSilently> Nothing here in Ireland, either.
<eXAKR> I was checking out the Toy'r'us stores here
<eXAKR> No blind bag ponies yet
<prince-dari> At the moment it's just Twilight sitting on my desk.
<Shaico> ARGH GET OUT OF MY HEAD
<Ascendant> ._.
<Ascendant> yeah it looks ):
<Shaico> Whyyyy Octavia!?
<Articuno> 12and I neeeeeeeeeed food
<Articuno> 12I will brb
<Ascendant> lmfao okay
<Drake> 04'Kay
<Drake> 04If I may say so, the text on the drop-down menus on your profile is too dark - it's hard to distinguish them from the background.
<Drake> 04*on the Ho-Oh theme
<eXAKR> Soon, I hope we get the series, the Canterlot collection, moar ponies, the plushes, the tote bags, the magazines, the books, and the WeLoveFine t-shirts
<Ascendant> damn
<eXAKR> Also our own pony bus
*eXAKR hides
<Ascendant> it molested the link rel and javascript
<Dermathil> hey RBD
<prince-dari> They changed the time slot of MLP here to 7am apparently.
<prince-dari> >_>
<prince-dari> <_<
<RainBroDash> sup dermathil :3
<Drake> 04Nice word choice there.
*Ascendant sadface
<eXAKR> Eek
<Ascendant> it's accurate :p
<prince-dari> Ohai RainBro.
<prince-dari> Hey Dermathil
<Drake> 04True
<lightumbreon> 06great...alotta trojan downloads
<FallSilently> I don't even have Boomerang....
<lightumbreon> 06and keyloggers
<Ascendant> ._.
<lightumbreon> 06oh, and atleast 5 worms!
<Drake> 04:/
<RainBroDash> so dari what did you get up to last night in the end buddy?
<Ascendant> just wipe it, lightumbreon
<lightumbreon> 06gonna do it
<Ascendant> or liveboot into linux, kill the viruses
<Drake> 04So NS, when's the next TST meeting thingamajig?
<lightumbreon> 06the defrg
<lightumbreon> 06then clean up a bit
<Ascendant> read topic
<Ascendant> "Next meeting is at 10:30pm GMT 8/8/2011."
<Ascendant> which is 8:30am for us
<prince-dari> The party turned out to be good, even though most of the people there were younger than me.
<RainBroDash> creeper ;)
<RainBroDash> i kid, i kid
<prince-dari> I know right. :P
<RainBroDash> XD
*Octavia smiles at Shaico, "i thought it was amazing!"
<Drake> 04Yeah no, not gonna make it.
<Shaico> ... Hmm it's actually pretty damn cool.
<Octavia> so creepy, yet so intriguing"
<Ascendant> Well, if I moved it to 8am, would you?
<Shaico> 1st time, freak the hell out.
<RainBroDash> last night was plagued with problems
<RainBroDash> -again-
<Shaico> 2nd time, bop your head to the beat.
<Shaico> I rather like it now :D
<prince-dari> I saw in Skype. :/
<RainBroDash> shit keeps going so fucking wrong. 2 weeks in a row >.>
<Ascendant> I'd hate 8am
<FallSilently> Did I fall into EAD again?
<prince-dari> It's every week I'm not there. :P
<Ascendant> in fact, I could do 6:30am
<RainBroDash> XD
<RainBroDash> <33
<prince-dari> XD
*Hayfever bites mirc. work correctly!
<Drake> 04Wouldn't be up at 6:30, parents' would get suspicious. 8am...maybe, but I wouldn't be around very long.
<prince-dari> How've you been doing anyway?
<RainBroDash> not bad
<RainBroDash> I've got that thing where your ears randomly clog up and you can't hear shit, but that's easily solved
*RainBroDash turns the music up
<Ascendant> 7am'd be risky
<Ascendant> definitely can't do 7:30am
<Drake> 04Neither
<RainBroDash> I might not be able to make bmn tonight
<Drake> 04I'll be getting ready for school at that time
<prince-dari> Ah right.
<prince-dari> I saw Hipster wouldn't make it either?
<prince-dari> I probably won't too.
<RainBroDash> bleugh
<Ascendant> yeah
<prince-dari> If you read up in Skype, I explained everything.
<Ascendant> and not 7:15
<RainBroDash> i did :)
<RainBroDash> also: thanks for the tip about the nick list, saved that
<Drake> 04Nope.
<Drake> 048am seems alright.
<Drake> 04But we'll need to check with others.
<prince-dari> You want to test if it works?
<Ascendant> I'm pretty sure most people will make it
<Ascendant> I honestly don't want to do 8:30am
<prince-dari> I tested it once, but it'd still be good to test it with someone else.
<RainBroDash> sure. where does it print it though?
<Ascendant> as that requires me to get up early
<Ascendant> and catch the 7:03 or 7:08 train

<Insidious_Lars> Okay
<Dermathil> Think one day you could stream Gurren Lagann like we did with Torchwood?
<FallSilently> Skynet?
<lightumbreon> 0610-4
<prince-dari> Sure, first I have to finish downloading all the Doctor Who epsiodes (50% at the moment), then I promised Sathi I'd get House.
<Ascendant> ?
<Insidious_Lars> Google
<prince-dari> But I'll get round to Gurren Lagann after that.
<FallSilently> DEAR GOD NO
<lightumbreon> 0610-4: military code for "affermative! or Understood!"

<Ascendant> alright
<mib_7fuc2p> well hell, let me refresh and put my real username on
<Dman> Rainbrodash, this is true. I have applied again, though, on August 3rd
<RainBroDash> yeah I mean aside from the most recent app. It's cool, circumstances have changed :)
<RainBroDash> just wanted to make sure
<Dman> I'd like to add that I took NewDCD's test (using a website he linked) and found that I have enough upload speed to livestream should anything happen
<RainBroDash> thanks bro

<Dermathil> Dman, PM.

<Dman> Rainbrodash it was 8 something something
<Dman> and NewDCD said minimum 5.6 or something
<RainBroDash> bahaha oh i thought you meant 8meg, i guess 0.8?
<Dman> Seeing as Dermathil adn I are here most of the week, and prince-dari's often busy to stream, then he or I could taker requests etc
<Dman> yea 0.8 then
<Dman> .82something or somethignlike that
<RainBroDash> well I've always been tempted to stream
<Dermathil> yeah
<RainBroDash> like, either with manycam/xsplit or even webcam
<RainBroDash> but the situation's never really arisen
<Dman> During the week, rainbrodash, during the week ;)
<prince-dari> You could stream yourself singing for me.

<Dman> GGgala :P
<Ascendant> well Drake
*GGgala is shocked. active chat in the morning?
<Insidious_Lars> Thank god
<Ascendant> me posting anything out of fanfiction/helpsuggestions/announcements is unusual
<Drake> 04XD
<Dermathil> heyo GGgala
<GGgala> hey Dermathil, everybody
<RainBroDash> xD
<Dman> Sup, of course, Gggala
<FallSilently> I'm here too but I'm up to shenanigens
<GGgala> and then, of course, there's naming the hero ZELDA
<GGgala> or THIEF
<prince-dari> Hey Sprinkles.
<SirSprinkles> 6Hey.
<Insidious_Lars> My B is broken
<RainBroDash> Sprinklesception
<RainBroDash> also hi
<SirSprinkles> So dari... what's with the Magnet bot?
<prince-dari> What about it?
<FallSilently> Your B?
<prince-dari> It's been here for a while.
<SirSprinkles> ...what's it for?
<Insidious_Lars> My type letter
<SirSprinkles> I've seen it do like, two things.
<Ghrathryn> I'm around, providing Chatzilla doesn't fail on me. I'm doing other things every so often though
<prince-dari> I dunno, just for fun, I remove it when the actual streams are on.
<prince-dari> The other mods seem to enjoy it.
<Dman> Hi there
<prince-dari> As well as users.
<SirSprinkles> I find some things kinda funny.
<Insidious_Lars> When this chat comes ack on call me
<Insidious_Lars> back*
<Dman> Will you be streaming today, then, sirsprinkles?
<SirSprinkles> 6Yes.
<Dman> Bene.
<prince-dari> It is REALLY spammy, which is why I remove it for streams.
<SirSprinkles> I can see how that would work.
<SirSprinkles> Any way to disable most of its functions and leave on a few things?
<ASF> admin states all around!
<Dermathil> heyo SirSprinkles
<prince-dari> Well I was thinking of having a system to limit use of the scripts to once every 30 seconds or something.
<SirSprinkles> Mostly just want the EqDaily notifications left on. It's a handy feature.
<Legomanjoshua> lars
<Legomanjoshua> go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LN5GrF-Gb0&NR=1
<SirSprinkles> That's still a lot.
<Insidious_Lars> Wait wat
<prince-dari> Meh, not compared to most users, if you wouldn't like that, I can try and do what you said, just leave EQD notifications on.
<Insidious_Lars> This is the most boring time yet
<prince-dari> Oh wait.
<Insidious_Lars> We need some Pinkie Pie
<prince-dari> EQD notifications aren't on my bot anyway.
<prince-dari> I have them on here.
<prince-dari> So it doesn't matter.
<SirSprinkles> ...lawl.
<prince-dari> I'll just remove the bot as I normally do.
<SirSprinkles> Well okay then.
<prince-dari> If I ever forget to mods can just kick it anyway.
<FallSilently> http://i1105.photobucket.com/albums/h346/FallSilently/SUP.jpg
<Dman> GGgala, and THEN there's naming the hero 'Fuck me'
<Dman> 'Oh, fuck me! I didn't see you there!' (entering icecaverns:) 'FUCK ME it's cold in here.' 'Fuck me, you can't defeat me!'
<Ascendant> oh awesome

<Dman> hahaha
<GGgala> i wasn't the most creative person

<Ascendant> and just when Xeli arrives too ;-;
<Beatline> Yeah, I understand xD
<GGgala> of course one of those clones went bad in Zelda II apparently
<Dman> lol
<Drake> 04You could take two days without me, and you can stand a night without me (that sounds seedy).
<EspyLacopa> And then I'm left wondering what was wrong with my guide book, since all the dungeons were wrong.

<Dman> prince-dari wtf did you and rainbrodash do on the beach?
<Insidious_Lars> What happened
<Legomanjoshua> when i type rainbow dash in ponibooru?
<prince-dari> INB4 Sex on the beach
<EspyLacopa> I missed that old jungle gym, before it got replaced by the 'kid friendly' version.
<Dman> that was mah point, prince-dari ;D
<EspyLacopa> A towering construction of hard metal pipes. Much fun was had climbing it and chasing other kids on it.
<MrPoniator> Welp, I'm off to play some BlazBrony
<GGgala> calling the replacement 'kid friendly' is like calling tiny halloween candy 'fun size'
<Emz> so much creepy fluttershy stuff on ponibooru :|
<Ascendant> !espeon
*Espeon still belongs to Global for 4 more minutes
*Ascendant splats Global with a piece of fail

<prince-dari> Using mIRC, good man. :)
<FreezeFrame> My college's cable doesn't have Hub

*Espeon is fine with the amount of bree.
*Octavia hums softly to herself as she sparks an epiphany, gathering a slightly used sheet from her notebook and draws in some notes to correct her mistakes.
<Glacymr> 12Espybree

*Ghrathryn leans against a wall, watching Octavia get to work before looking around
*Insidious_Lars sits on the ground after the massive explosion
*Beatline has no choice but to lay on the floor on his back, still charred from the blast and looking around dazedly
*Insidious_Lars heads starts to bleed a little

<Dave_BroZilla> AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SHIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
<Insidious_Lars> Sectumsempra popcorn!
<Insidious_Lars> Wonder if it worked
*Octavia looks down at Beatline, taking her handkerchief and dipping it in her glass of water, then offers it to the charred pony, "youve got a little something... here" pointing nondescriptly at her face
*Insidious_Lars popcorn is splitted in galf
*Ghrathryn flicks his tail noticing Beatline injured and frowns. Walks over to Beat and armours up, running a scan. "More than something, Octavia"
*Octavia smiles at Ghrathryn, "you seem to have more experience, by all means"
<FreezeFrame> Killing time until stream
<Insidious_Lars> Hmph
<Dermathil> Hey Dave_BroZilla.
<Dermathil> GIGA DRILL BREAK
<Dave_BroZilla> Tru dat
<Dave_BroZilla> YOURS IS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS
<Dermathil> yeah
*Beatline chuckles. "I noticed." He takes the handkerchief and dabs a majority of the char from his face, handing the blackened cloth back to her by a clean tip as he rolls himself back onto his legs.
<Dave_BroZilla> So, the percocets finally wore off from my wisdom teeth removal last friday
<Dermathil> I convinced Dari to stream Gurren Lagann after House
<Dave_BroZilla> ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCK
<Ghrathryn> Occupational hazard, Octavia. *Frowns behind his helmet as the scan reveals Beatline's injuries* Doesn't look too bad though. Mostly singed fur by the look of it
<Dermathil> >achievement: ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWA
<GGgala> when is House streaming?
<Dermathil> dunno
<Dermathil> After Doctor Who I think
<Dman> sorry dermahil i'm semiafk
<Dman> i'm preparing to leave
<Balloons> Wait, was this my Pipe bomb that caused this?
*Octavia giggles softly trying not to offend and tucks it into her saddlebag
<Dave_BroZilla> I'm so excited for tomorrow. Means new epi of Gokaiger
<Dermathil> yeah
<Insidious_Lars> Maybe an endoscopist and an orthopedics should do
<Melodia> Huh
*Beatline looks resolutely at tge colt looking over him. "Excuse me, sir, but I'll have you know that I am a doctor. I think I can judge well enough when I am injured."
<Insidious_Lars> Meet...THE ORTHOPEDICS AND THE ENDOSCOPIST SPECIALIST
<Melodia> Did the RP channels get shut down or something?
<Dave_BroZilla> So, lottery is today...what's everyone's choices?
*Ghrathryn dismisses his armour back to wherever
<Insidious_Lars> Pr spmething
<Insidious_Lars> Or*
<Beatline> Melodia: We're justgoofing around
<Dermathil> Apocalypse NOw
<Beatline> The RP is a lot more serious xP
<FreezeFrame> The Last Unicorn!
*Octavia is just being casual.
<Ziltoid> A:Falling Down B:Re-animator
<Octavia> i can talk about my php fiasco going on
<Beatline> Go ahead and discuss something if you wish
<Octavia> but thats not very pony.
<Dermathil> Oh, and The Game (the 1997 movie) as B-Movie
<Ghrathryn> And doesn't have a dragon with a modularised version of a guyver unit in it
<Ziltoid> FUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
<FreezeFrame> Actually, haven't given it much thought.
<Dermathil> Bridle Gossip as pony ep
<Beatline> But nopony really feels like talking when we DON'T do this.
<Ziltoid> I lost
<Dermathil> GURREN LAGANN EP 20 HERE I COME
<Melodia> Ah
<Melodia> Just esepcially on the AfterDark chan I've been seeing it a lot past couple ddays
<Ghrathryn> PHP problems, Octavia?
<FallSilently> Normally I'd be trolling the heck out role players in here but nobody else seems to be doing anything so I'm leaving them alone.
<Sneas> 03http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Qfck99QqEE
<Dave_BroZilla> The Great Mouse Detective as either A or B, but if it's definitively B category, Jurassic Park as A movie
<Octavia> Ghrathryn, its not problems as much as just tying it all together
<Dave_BroZilla> And The Griffon The Brush Off for pony ep
*FreezeFrame brohoofs Dave_BroZilla for Great Mouse Detective
<Beatline> *shrug*
<Dermathil> No brohoof for Apocalypse Now?
<Ghrathryn> That's always... interesting with coding
<Dermathil> FLIGHT OF THE VALKYRIES
*Dave_BroZilla recieves and distributes brohoof in kind
<FreezeFrame> If I'd seen it, yes.
<Beatline> I'm fine with cutting the RP when we start discussing something.
<Dermathil> This movie is about the horrors of the Vietnam War.
<Insidious_Lars> Well Beatline
*FreezeFrame doesn't actually watch a whole lot of movies.
<Dermathil> The Heart of Darkness.
<Dermathil> (That's what I've heard about it)
<Ghrathryn> And the rain that Firefox's weather addon has been promising finally arrived
<FreezeFrame> Dermathil: I know what it's about, I just don't watch movies.
<Dermathil> (never seen it either)
<Beatline> The RP is usually a good catalyst to get ponies in here so we can discuss somethinh.
<Beatline> *thing
<Insidious_Lars> You were lucky to not have standardpenetrating and blunt trauma.
<Dermathil> WUH
<Dermathil> You don't watch the movies/
<Octavia> better than nothing.
<Dermathil> Q_Q
<FreezeFrame> Tower of Death/The Crow
<Beatline> Exactly.
<Insidious_Lars> Well
<Insidious_Lars> Wait what
<FreezeFrame> Dermathil: No, I don't usually watch movies in general. I watch the movies from Brony Movie Night.
<Dman> let's go let's go gigadrillbreak
<Ghrathryn> I figure ponies here are as hardy as they believe themselves to be
<Dermathil> Whew FreezeFrame.
<Dermathil> Dman: LET'S GO LET'S GIGADRILLBREAK!

<Octavia> besides, im in the topic. so, rock on, bronies.
<Beatline> "Exactly" was at 'Better than nothing', I believe I am fairly lucky not to be injured. xP
*Octavia airguitars. yeaaaaah.
<Dermathil> I think cowboys and aliens is good.
<FreezeFrame> Cowboys and Aliens, I've heard, is in the so bad it's good realm
<Ghrathryn> Of course that's from a guy who usually sends his main original characters against daemons, and not the nice ones
<Dman> yay~
<Dermathil> yeah
<Dermathil> ARC GURREN
<Insidious_Lars> Hm
<Insidious_Lars> I feel left out :|
<Beatline> Hmm. Need to practice, I'll be AFK-ish for a bit
<Insidious_Lars> Well seeing that if your pretty close to the bomb id say you won't have any injuries
<Dave_BroZilla> I was going to watch it with friends on thursday, but the girls in the group chickened out and wanted to see Crazy Stupid Love, so we all decided to see Horrible Bosses in the end
<Dave_BroZilla> very funny
<Insidious_Lars> But there will be TM rupture and middle ear damage
<Insidious_Lars> So be sure to get medical attention if nescessarry
<Dave_BroZilla> 0H SNAP
<Dave_BroZilla> TERMINATOR IS ON TV
<Ghrathryn> I don't think he's listenin' Lards

<FreezeFrame> Others I don't like: Pachelbel. Because of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM

<Dman> i'm viewing rant now
*ninjapwny is from the south
<ninjapwny> y'all
*Parchment_Scroll is from... well, to quote Connor Macleod, "lots of different places."
<Prof_Pi> "who all is in here?" "all's" sounds like a perfectly legitimate contraction to me.
<ninjapwny> YEA
<ninjapwny> SUCK IT, GRAMMAR NAZIS
<Dave_BroZilla> wtf am i watching troll.mp4
*Nuclear detectors pick up GOLD
<Nuclear> Mmmmmm

<Dman> dave_brozilla japanese trolling at it's best :D
<Insidious_Lars> Story synopsis of Catherine:Vincent likes his girlfriend. Katherine's pretty, smart, and successful. Trouble is, she's starting to talk about long-term commitment, something Vincent's spent his entire life avoiding. Since romantic complications are the last thing he wants to deal with, Vincent meets his friends for their regular night of drinks. Little does he know that he's about to be blindsided by a beautiful, seductive,
<Dave_BroZilla> jesus, lol
<Nuclear> Yeah
<ninjapwny> WTF^
<Nuclear> Cool
<FreezeFrame> The second violins would get lovely melodies, which just shouldn't happen.
<Insidious_Lars> And it was pretty awesome for a synopsis
<Parchment_Scroll> O_o
<Dman> 1 2 3 4 TAKAKTAKATAKA BOM TAKA BOM TAKA BOM TAKA
*ninjapwny apparently missed the beginning of the conversation
<Parchment_Scroll> Wait, so all that climbing and bloody spikes was a metaphor for cold feet?
<Dman> BUM TAKA BUM TA BUM BUTA BUM TAKA
<Dave_BroZilla> wah wahh wahh wahwahhhhhh
<Dman> TAKATO TAKA TU BYA!
<Parchment_Scroll> @ninjapwny: We're discussing http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCHCiYu7X1g&feature=channel_video_title
<Insidious_Lars> Nope
<Dman> >dat song pachelbel rant. i know dat feel
<Insidious_Lars> To survive
<Prof_Pi> Not exactly; there have been these mysterious deaths that no one can explain.
<Insidious_Lars> As it said
<FreezeFrame> The viola part isn't that bad.
<Dman> dave_brozilla yourfacewhen the bass guitar
<Insidious_Lars> Climb or Die
<Dman> TF TF TFT FTFTTFFTF
<FreezeFrame> They stay on the basso continuo for 2/3 of the song before they finally get on the canon
<Dman> freezeframe i guess :P
<FreezeFrame> er, that much better*
<Dman> =]
<Parchment_Scroll> Well, yeah, but the symbolism makes more sense now. Like, for example, the giant creepy baby.
<Dman> Dermathil left?
<Prof_Pi> There are rumors that the people who have died were cursed due to being unfaithful.
<FreezeFrame> Nope, he's stil here
<Dermathil> Still here
<Dman> I see that, but he 'here' here? Ah you are :P
<Dman> yay~
<Dermathil> More concentrated on Lagann
<Parchment_Scroll> I'm considering entering the Happy Luna contest.
<Dman> hi five
<Insidious_Lars> And also
<Insidious_Lars> Some deaths are aquired during deaths
<FreezeFrame> Worst part is for church choir we had a Pachelbel lyrical setting where the bass section provided the basso continuo
<FreezeFrame> Guess what I sing?
<Insidious_Lars> dreams*
<ninjapwny> WTF DID I JUST WATCH o_o
*Dermathil brohoofs Dman.
<Parchment_Scroll> ATLUS RELEASES NEW GAME MADE OF WTFJAPAN.
<Prof_Pi> And there's the repeated assertion that if you fall in a dream without waking up, you die.
<Insidious_Lars> Awesome Vincent climbing stuff
<Insidious_Lars> Yep
*Dman brohoofs Dermathil, his other hand holding a durillu
<Dman> what do ya sing, freezeframe?
<Insidious_Lars> The dream is the reality sometimes i'm guessing?
<Dave_BroZilla> J. Geils Band?
<Parchment_Scroll> Yeah, but that's not true. I've died in dreams multiple times and I'm pretty sure I'm alive.
<Dave_BroZilla> FREEZE FRAME
<Insidious_Lars> I died in many ways in my dream
<Dermathil> HECK YEAH
<Parchment_Scroll> 80% sure. Needs to be about 20% surer.
*FreezeFrame watches troll.mp4
<Insidious_Lars> And trust me you do not wanna know how I die
<FreezeFrame> Dman: I'm a bass
*Dman loves freezeframe
<Dman> O i c then :P
<Dave_BroZilla> 80s RULES SUPREME
<ninjapwny> so its like inception?
*Dermathil is a bawss.
<Parchment_Scroll> Got gunned down in a bank robbery once. Um. Fell. Burned. Blowed up...
<Insidious_Lars> Yes
<Dermathil> with a rocket lawnchair.
<Dermathil> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/295/8/9/rocket_lawnchair_by_neo_kirby_and_watch-d31bbmj.gif
<Insidious_Lars> First death dream
<FreezeFrame> My highest note is D above middle C
<Dman> dat pic. nevergonnagetboredof
<Insidious_Lars> Get explicitly teared down by a chainssaw
<Dman> dat's pretty impressive
<Dermathil> hehehe
<Parchment_Scroll> Usually, you wake up. Sometimes, you can latch onto another character in the dream and start following them around. Then it's less "Inception" and more "Fallen."
<Parchment_Scroll> Ouch.
<User_687> before i read past sins should i watch the episodes first?
<Insidious_Lars> Nah
<FreezeFrame> Occasionally E if the air is right and I only have to hit one in the song.
<Insidious_Lars> But its reccommended
<Dman> omagad! freezeframe that medley!
<Insidious_Lars> Second death you may ask?
*RobotPinkie taps microphone
<Dman> very impressed
*Dman smiles at robotpinkie
<RobotPinkie> This thing on?
<Parchment_Scroll> One might indeed.
<Dave_BroZilla> Sarah Connor is mother of the future
<Insidious_Lars> Getting crawled by babies and being eaten by the babies alive
<RobotPinkie> 'sup Dman
<Dman> Copy that, RP, i hear you loud and clear.
<Parchment_Scroll> And we have a winner for most borked up dream death ever.

<RoyKirbs> To clarify I don't clop to my dreams but um...
<FreezeFrame> Since she can hit incredibly high notes without making it painful.
<RoyKirbs> They get bloody messed up at times. :x
<Ziltoid> rarity has best siging voice

<Dave_BroZilla> wait...how did kyle get topless all of a sudden?
<RobotPinkie> wtf kind of movie are you watching?
<FreezeFrame> Rarity's is good, too, but the notes that Twilight's singing actor hits without causing ear bleeding are simply impressive.
<Parchment_Scroll> I just want to know what genius chose "clop" as the word to describe that? To me, it conjures up an image of, well, pony applause.

<Dermathil> THIS DRILL IS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS

<RobotPinkie> I dunno, I don't mind bigger than that...
<ninjapwny> maybe u can pull it off
<Dermathil> 1/2 the animation budget in the last 5 eps
<DerpyBot> New post on Equestria Daily by Cereal Velocity: Story: ARTICLE (http://tinyurl.com/3jf33bv)

Rarity was stunned to see that it was none other than Princess Luna, addressing Mrs. Cake. “I'm sorry to bother you, Mrs. Cake,” the princess said politely, “but we're nearly out of pearled barley, and I think we need more...” She ducked her

<Pyroh> I need waffles...
*Pegacorn slaps Dermathil

<Dermathil> (four episodes left only)
<Dave_BroZilla> By people I don't know
<Dave_BroZilla> but still lulzy
<Dave_BroZilla> cause it's true
<Ghrathryn> had a joint set that averaged 200k-600k per main fic
<Flamerunner> What happens in Las Vegas
<Flamerunner> Stays in New Vegas
<RobotPinkie> haven't seen all of gurren lagann
<^RainbowDash> Short stories aren't my forte because I describe things too much.
<^RainbowDash> But I'm also too lazy for cpnsistently writing anything long...
<RobotPinkie> KETSUROOOOOOOOOON
<^RainbowDash> So yeah.
<Insidious_Lars> I'd made a short story
<RobotPinkie> out of fuckin' nowhere
*Pegacorn slaps Dermathil again

<DragonRage> Cheerilee? That's not how you spell Vinyl Scratch.
<Silverscreen> 11oh yeah, Steven isn't on.

<SilverMane> hi Razyn, other people
<SomeBrony> DAE saw Tron (not Legacy)?
<RobotPinkie> Not sure why Cheerilee is so popular though, but hey, if somepony that doesn't even exist called "Nyx" can win a popularity contest...
<Aponymous> Hi Silvermane
<FreezeFrame> LoneWolf414: That's a weird way of spelling Angry White Boy Polka. :P
<typjk> I only played Tron 2.0 that was quite nice

<Aponymous> Rarity is the only being in existence who can pull off a duckface and not look fucking retarded.
<FluxBrony> TGPFluttershy nope, that would be Scootaloo XD
<SilverMane> Ghosties: I wouldn't believe you one second. Also, idc if people are brony are not anymore, as I will still sing Winter Wrap Up to them either way

<EspyLacopa> I missed the duckface.
<RobotPinkie> Oh she mad
<HaveTubaWillTravel> I love how something as tiny as attaching a button spiralled into the mammoth task it did.

<Pegacorn> Gummy and Opal are the only pets that scare L4D Tanks away.
<EspyLacopa> Aponymous: Hence Rarity making a new one for her.
<Ghosties> Hmm, I see.
<FluxBrony> don't you mean "hoofwork"
<Darf14> Burn that dress with fire!
<Ghosties> Ah, there's sathi
<Sathi> lol just woke up...
<Frubban> SirSprinkles That's how it works in here.
<Twwisted> But the food we've stored is running out, and we can't grow in this cold.
<Ziltoid> nah
<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> naa
<Sathi> slept the entire day
<DragonRage> She points down. But she's not actually wearing anything.
<FreezeFrame> But the food we've stored is runnin' out, and we can't grow in this snow
<LoneWolf414> what happens when gummy finally gets his teeth?
<Ghosties> 4Oh my
<TheBanteringBrony> That vid that I posted totally misrepresents what bronies truley are

<SilverMane> Did anyone notice that Twilight's dress that she brought in was one that she tried on in episode one during Rarity's make over scene?
<Ghosties> I just woke up fifteen minutes ago
<Aponymous> Gummy's teeth rotted out from all the candy Pinkie gave him.
<Veewave> 15Durhur.
<DragonRage> Random fabric + Bucket on head. Very trendy.
<TGPFluttershy> Continuity error?
<SirSprinkles> Odd, I woke up INCREDIBLY early today.
<ValtheJean> I wonder why noone cares about the excessive amounts of property damage RBD causes....
<FreezeFrame> I think everypony in ponyville has to purchase a Rainbow Dash rider
<Sathi> semi afk cooking something as my tummy is rumbling
<SirSprinkles> Which is weird considering I was working until 1 AM last night.
<LoneWolf414> I love fun things!
<SilverMane> It's magic ValtheJean, i don't gotta explain shit
<FreezeFrame> For their insurance
<Aponymous> Dash has "Hero insurance"
<Frubban> Probably.
<Axel_Foaley> SPOILER: Rainbow Dash loves fun things
<EspyLacopa> ValtheJean: I think by now everyone knows that it's just a regular hazard with living in the same town as her.
<Ghosties> Early, eh?
<Ghosties> That sucks
<HeavyMetalPony> You make me hard.
<SilverMane> and they can repair it with magic, so

<interior_gummy> 0@Silverscreen Pinkie Pie doesn't sing this!
<TGPFluttershy> Well, that song and WWU
<typjk> i mean in the song, silvermane
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Because it deserves a real Emmy.
<DareDreamer> That would be EPIC.
<SilverMane> ah
<Silverscreen> 11@interior_Gummy how observant.
<FluxBrony> That's not how you spell Twilight Sparkle
<HeavyMetalPony> Fluttershy: because it's the hub
<Axel_Foaley> Because this song rips off an obscure Barbara Streisand song.
<FreezeFrame> After reading On a Sword and Arrow, I want to record myself singing Elusive's version of this.
<TGPFluttershy> Opal has taste, unlike some other animals
<FreezeFrame> >.>
<SLIPKNOT> hey does anyone know how long this episode is ?
<FluxBrony> 22 mins
<SilverMane> interior_gummy is a pinky fan, ay?
<LoneWolf414> 22 minutes
<interior_gummy> 0@Silverscreen but you said it was sung by the best pony
<RobotPinkie> Pinkie is best pony, but then again, so is Rarity....... I'm so conflicted. :(
<HeavyMetalPony> it's like 22 minutes
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Not long enough, like all pony eps.
<Aponymous> Song was around before Barbara Streisand...
<TGPFluttershy> Axel_Foaley Something tell me that Barbara would love it
<FreezeFrame> Axel: that Barbara Streisand song, in turn, ripped off a SOndheim song
<SomeBrony> poker
<SomeBrony> face
<KenzamakaAndCo> So I finished the dresses whaddya thi- THEYRE FUCKING SHIT
<EspyLacopa> Look, Pink!

<SilverMane> YOUR FAVORITE
<Ignaesia> 50% of songs released today are just covers anyway
<Sathi> no they are awesome
<LoneWolf414> just watch it Slipknot
<lolbee> this scene confuses me
<TGPFluttershy> Rarity you suck! You didn't do what I asked for! You suck as an artist!
*Pegacorn takes the opportunity of Bjornfot not being here to GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE.
<interior_gummy> 0Y U NO LOVE PINKIE
<FreezeFrame> I love how Pinkie Pie's is a super-elegant version of a candyshop uniform
<SLIPKNOT> ok lonewolf14
<Pinkamina> it's... nice
<EspyLacopa> Rainbow Dash's tactless honesty amuses me.
<Darf14> *facepalm* oh Rainbow
<SilverMane> i love something too!
<Axel_Foaley> All the more reason why it wouldn't win an Emmy.

<DSNesmith> so, just wonderin', any of you ever bought the wrong type of hardware several times in a row?
<RobotPinkie> I know, I'm just that good!
<SilverMane> inb4 Pinkie Pie is a Candy-striper!
<TGPFluttershy> Fact. Rarity is the only true artist in the show
<Sathi> Well back to cooking ;)

<interior_gummy> 0pinkie pie has mastered the art of defying physics
<RobotPinkie> Oh man I love Rarity so much in this episode
<EspyLacopa> HeavyMetalPony: They're debating on if they want to admit they like the show too?
<SilverMane> nope SLIPKNOT, id on't believe this computer is here

<RobotPinkie> Well, Rarity is always awesome, but especially so here
<Razyn> Dat nerd
<EspyLacopa> Darf14: I don't think you're supposed to unless you also know the jargon.
<interior_gummy> 0rarity needs the magic of caffiene
<LoneWolf414> i want a m1 abrahms tank painted like rainbow dash
<Ignaesia> I never really cared for Rarity until this episode
<ValtheJean> for some reason...this song makes playing Supreme Commander easier...I'm not sure why
<HaveTubaWillTravel> That still frame of Rarity's face just before the song always makes me LOL
<Darf14> good point
<Frubban> Exactly. True Frensh fashinable BIRDSNEST.
<Axel_Foaley> whoa, suddenly harmony
<SilverMane> Rarity always has such good episodes made about her.Since she's such a human-character, it's easy to write very good stories i guess
<Frubban> fashion*
<FreezeFrame> Look before you Sleep was a good one for Rarity, too.
<RobotPinkie> Rarity is a marshmallow, so she needs hot chocolate
<DSNesmith> I thought rarity was going to be the one I disliked, she ended up being my favorite
<HeavyMetalPony> Great, now my dad's trying to bring me out of my room with the smell of popcorn just so he ca nse what I
<HeavyMetalPony> *I'm doing in here
<FreezeFrame> Tell him.
<SLIPKNOT> hahaha
<DragonRage> Likewise, DSNesmith.

<FreezeFrame> Make your dad a Brony
<RobotPinkie> Hot chocolate + marshmallow = win
<ValtheJean> I actually liked the Diamond Dogs episode...
<DareDreamer> ech
<SilverMane> yes EspyLacopa? Don't mke me start wining
<Axel_Foaley> So Marshmallow gives you tuban throat singing powers.
<EspyLacopa> heh

<SLIPKNOT> funny how my name here is in big bold yellow letters :P
<DareDreamer> I'd pick the Diamond Dogs ep. if I won the lotto
<TheBanteringBrony> INB4: 20% cooler
<Twwisted> 20% cooler
<Frubban> FLUTTERSHY
<HaveTubaWillTravel> Holland also exists, according to this same episode
<Darf14> needs to be 20% more cooler
<Pegacorn> I need to know if a Spy is here so i can be safe
<Frubban> Definitely.
<FreezeFrame> Fluttershy wouldn't have looked good in that haute couture outfit, anyway.
<Pinkamina> It needs to be about 20% cooler.
<HeavyMetalPony> Frubban: No, I'm in your dreams BRAAAAAAAM
<Aponymous> No one can out passive aggressive Rarity.
<ValtheJean> I can agree with that RobotPinkie, just I don't understand why so many people hate it
<SirSprinkles> 6<TheBanteringBrony>: INB4: 20% cooler <Twwisted>: 20% cooler
<SirSprinkles> 6AHAHAHAHA
<EspyLacopa> I laughed so much at how completely Rarity manipulated the diamond dogs
<Pegacorn> inb4 20% cooler
<Ivan> Rainbow Dashs voice is really off in this song
<ValtheJean> after all, it's the episode we get Manly Spike :P
<SilverMane> Fluttershy gives in more easilly to stress, Rarity just goes crazy if she is ridiculed
<Axel_Foaley> 40% Frieza 20% Cooler
<RobotPinkie> I didn't know so many d?
<lolbee> how did that design turn into what it did?

<RobotPinkie> and yeah, Spike's fantasy is epic
*Bjornfot When I was a little spammer and the banhammer was going dooown~ The warnings and the kicks they would always make me frooown~ I'd hide behind my proxy, from what I thought I saw- But grandpa Brony said that wasn't the way to deal with mods at all-
<SLIPKNOT> can you watch any movie on here ???
*Bjornfot He said: Bjornfot, you gotta stand up tall- Learn to face the +ops, you'll see that they can't hurt you just laugh to make them disappear~ LOL! LULZ! ROFLCOPTER!
<timmymonsta> *BANNED*
<FreezeFrame> Nittany: This is the part where the song became more blatantly the crew's rant about executive meddling
<Darf14> Opal is not impressed
<interior_gummy> 0since spike isn't a pony, does he clop or fap to rarity?
*Bjornfot So! Giggle at the moddies, guffaw at the admins, crack up at the half-ops, whoop up with the streamer, chortle at the owner, snortle at scriptbot-
<Pegacorn> Ohai BJornfot
<Frubban> LOL
*Bjornfot And tell that big dumb scary mod to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can ban you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... OLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO... heh...

<KAM1KAZEKITTEN> you shouldn't look a gift human in the mouth.
<FreezeFrame> Rainbow Dash's cutie mark has nothing to do with her speed, or anything else like that. It's because she has the power to suddenly cause rock music.
<TGPFluttershy> And that's how Rarity finally got famous
<Darf14> So many dresses 0_o
