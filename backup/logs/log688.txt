<Ghosties> 04Tomatoes and onions are my biggest no no's when it comes to vegetables
<flutterbutt> GilDash: chicken tikka
<CrimsonPhoenix> Ximlee, stop right now if you plan on spamming that sentence
<CloverMuffins> red_ony2: ya, something like that... when I watched it I had a craving for broccoli with cheese o0

<J_E_Smith71> Tovler: It's 118 minutes so it should be over the about 28 mins rught

<sonicdude558> Bye, here is a whooooa for Sumi
<TheMaster> This is a great movie, not one you'd normally think of as showing here.
<Gaston> I'm th doctor.
<fluttercry> 05,15Fuck tomatoes. Though give me more onions
<flutterbutt> GilDash: um, it was chicken tikka and rice, from tesco
<GilDash> Also, tomatoes are fruit...
<prince-dari> >not liking tomatoes
<GilDash> flutterbutt: Did it have sauce?
<Virgil29> :O
<J_E_Smith71> Ghosties: So you don't like ketchup either?
<Tovler> Tomatoes are toes
<flutterbutt> GilDash: yes
<OJ> TheMaster: I was quite surprised
<prince-dari> Bitch please, I could eat cherry tomatoes all day long.
<pony_5363> TheMaster: too many queens in the mlp series. need kings
<Ghosties> 04Of course I like ketchup
<SirGanjalf> Ghosties: Yeah i used to dislike tomatoes as a kid, even though i loved anything that was made from tomatoes, eg. ketchup, soups...
<Gaston> Potatoes are poes
<flutterbutt> pony_5363: eeeeeeewww

<Luna> 07,01we have to go deeper!
<Kandarihu> I've pretty much outgrown the whole "Picky Eater" phase when I was VERY young.
<Ghosties> 04:D
*flutterbutt does not like cherry tomatoes
<Kurra> TOmatoes WIN \m/ >_< \m/
<Everlasting_Joy> Ghosties: :).
<Dr_Fumbles> WE MUST GO DERPER
<Ryunosuke> uhh

<flutterbutt> they're like little red packages of hate
<AJIsAwesome> CUE INCEPTION BUTTON
<pony_5363> Ghosties: this is my life
<twilight_sprinkle> ketchup is nice
<Pale_Horse> The power of Friendship!
<twilight_sprinkle> mayo is better though
<OJ> Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
*Luna 07,01lost the movie again
<prince-dari> Ketchup is taking tomatoes, fucking ruing them, then adding a shit ton of sugar.
<prince-dari> Bullshit.
<Ryunosuke> I think I need an adult there luna :)
<cowvarkian> prince-dari: so, you could eat tomatos all day, but hate ketchup and Ghosties hates tomatos but could eat ketchup all day
<pony_5363> yep
<Kandarihu> Cherry Tomatoes are among my favorite healthy snack.
<AlienWarhead> prince-dari I like tomatoes and we are having a weird conversion aren't we
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Please
<Ghosties> 04>eat ketchup all day

<fluttercry> 05,15His brother abdicated the throne and now he is the king. STill can't talk
<GilDash> flutterbutt: Right, well it wasn't just tikka then. Tikka is just the way chicken is prepared with spices, and usually left to marinade for 24 hours. The sauce will be masala, so together, chicken tikka masala. :)
<Ghosties> 04Ew
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Just end already

<otakon> okay back
<VenHur> I'm suprised to see the Powerpuff Girls Movie as the B Movie...sure, it have it's flaws, and it's a box office bomb...
<TheMaster> Queen Elizabeth is quite cool though, she likes Dr.Who and goes skydiving with james bond
<Kammerjunk> prince-dari: Oh, it's that show! I remember that being streamed.
<IshSexiestPony> was that the actor who played wormtail back there?
<marley> knight him or give him An OBE
<Dr_Fumbles> Gotta love that Beethoven
<Saturn> 08,01this piece is from Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto
<Cades> I'd rather get a job that doesn't require any skill
<koobz> *push him off the balcony*
<otakon> hopefully that did it
<Buytoast> oh wow, they stole that set from the royal wedding
<Saturn> 08,01also known as the Emperor Piano Concerto

<VenHur> But as a fan, I enjoy it.

<Erdrick> "[The King's Speech] isn't so much a movie as it is an expertly filled-out 'How To Win An Oscar' Mad Libs sheet."—Movie Bob
<TheMaster> amusingly, I think America cares more about british royalty than britain does
<SuperSanjitenks1989> go to powerpuff girls
<Gaston> I'd say, I'm sorry. The end.
<Cades> My dad says he could get me a job where I literally fold rags and that's pretty much it

<Rex_Ivan> Low key movie does not feel the need to impress you, but instead takes it's time with what it has.
<K_A> This piece sounds familiar. Saturn, do you know it?
<fluttercry> 05,15That movie deserved any Oscar it received
<Daygon> Who here saw the sneakpeak of season 3?
<CCCP> didn't see it/10
<Kammerjunk> fluttercry: Yes.
<Cades> But I already tried, and it eventually got pretty boring
<Saturn> 08,01btw, this is Mozart
<Dr_Fumbles> Ghosties: You won
<VenHur> Speeck for the win/10
<Kammerjunk> So much yes.

<Kammerjunk> I was thinking Beethoven, though, since I've been listening to a lot more Beethoven than Mozart lately.
<DocSane> Fou_Lou: Ah, well, I think this was really more of an Anglosphere thing.
<RDash5000> ponies
<Saturn> 08,01actually, it hink Mozart only wrote one clarinet concerto
<String_Shredder> FUCKSHITSHITSHITSHITBALLSARSEBUGGERARSE. and tits/9.7

<Fou_Lou> DocSane: could be. Or maybe just too niche
<Kandarihu> You know what? I was really looking forward to getting Dragon Quest on the stream for the longest time. Unfortunately, I'm now fasting on ponies. So even though it's finally happening, I can't watch.
<K_A> Saturn: Yep, just as I believe Beethoven wrote only one violin concierto.

<pony_9000> hey ScootScootaloo
<K_A> Yeah, this was really good.
<Fou_Lou> DocSane: dubbed. we usally dont have subtitles here
<Cades> Problem is, I don't know what language to start with
<Everlasting_Joy> So how are we going to preserve "doorhead"?
<Calcos323> CrimsonPhoenix: Seriously, thank you so much for suggesting this. You made my night
<CrimsonPhoenix> fun fact I only suggested it for the theme song

<CrimsonPhoenix> look it up
<otakon> WHat is this music? I like it
<koobz> Gaston: YES
<GilDash> I was throughly impressed with that. I shall be watching again later today. :)
<Kandarihu> Kammerjunk, the fast goes on until the election. The only thing I'll break it for is the S3 premier. I held off on fasting in fact out of concern that it might be before.
<SuperSanjitenks1989> give us the powerpuffpls
<VenHur> Fucking Beethoven...such a classic.
<Pale_Horse> It was a great movie as-is, but it would have been even MORE entertaining if the king was getting speech therapy from the dread pirate Barbossa. :D
<VenHur> After the ponies, silly bronies.
<CrimsonPhoenix> when Celestia make her speech
<Gaston> ^^^^^^
<Kammerjunk> Kandarihu: Pardon, election?
<otakon> SuperSanjitenks1989: later on man, probably around 9:30 or so
<Cynder7> 6I think we're doing/going to do pascal or something like that..
<Pale_Horse> Then he could deliver all his speeches like a pirate! :D
<SirGanjalf> Pale_Horse: :D oh god, i can imagine that

<CloverMuffins> fabules :3
<Ersatz> Rarity is actually the most practically dressed, since the grass IS purple.
<Dr_Fumbles> She is such an attention whore
<Cades> That would be pretty cool
<SuperSanjitenks1989> Rarity: The Popular Dress Bitch

<Daygon> Yes, still not interesting

<ASoftFluffyThing> CloverMuffins /)
<otakon> cowvarkian: eeyup
<Buytoast> she's been confirmed for a bitch since the beginning
<XylemTube> RD confirmed for best pony
<Kemy> Weirdest. Couple. Ever
<J_E_Smith71> But it ended up being a cliche episode where the dragons ended up being bullies type deal and Spike doesn't think they're as great as thought kind of ep
<Everlasting_Joy> I love Rarity so much in this episode :).
<otakon> RD is haughty
<DocSane> Snip, snip, snip go his little dragon balls.

<twilight_sprinkle> SHADDUP SPIKE,I DONT CARE
<Kammerjunk> 'Twas fun.
<Dr_Fumbles> Pale_Horse: 6_9
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, PaladinDrakkenwolf. :)
<CloverMuffins> ohai PaladinDrakkenwolf
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy PaladinDrakkenwolf.
<Gaston> In a dumpster
<otakon> Sumica: excpet Rarity... he did HORRIBLE things to Rarity that can't be said in polite company....
<Daygon> He is not trying to be cute Rarity, just stop.
<thelonepony> hi PaladinDrakkenwolf :)
<Bjornfot> :3
<CrimsonPhoenix> He's Rainbow Dash
<OJ> Maury has the answers
<RAWRity> psh, Kind's Speech is boring imo.
<naturesfury> yay...
<pony_300> rofl yay
<Daygon> yay
<LunasGuard> twilight sprinkle is the mom
<Sergio_Scriptor> :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> schizophrenia
<cowvarkian> OJ: brock has the answers
<pony_9000> a rainbowdash
<otakon> ^
<CloverMuffins> omg ;(
<Sumica> 00,10twi will take any excuse to stay up all night reading
<otakon> thank you
<twilight_sprinkle> LunasGuard: o.o
<Buytoast> CRAAAAAAAWLING IIIIIIIIN MY SCAAAAAAAAAAAAALES
<Crippler> Deathwing's salad days.
<Spazturtle> otakon: I think there is a fic about that
<CloverMuffins> don't cry Spike
<ASoftFluffyThing> OJ: Spike, you are NOT the father
<Daygon> I wouldn't
<otakon> I mean it had it's bits
<Saturn> 08,01wait a second
<K_A> pony_300: He was probably upset that Rarity wasn't "appreciating" the qualities he wants her to see in him and was effectively friendzoning him.
<fluttercry> 05,15Like I said earlier. Interest in the subject matter probably helps a ton
<Dr_Fumbles> We just steal eggs and enslave dragons, we don't give a fuck
<otakon> but really, it was Oscar bait pure and simple
<Mutterguy> yay existiantial crisis!
<cowvarkian> Saturn: I'll wait two seconds
<RAWRity> I just cannot get invested in "He has to get over a stutter"
<Tamazarashi> NOT EVERY BOOK IN YOUR LIBRARY HAD DRAGONS IN IT TWILIGHT
<SirGanjalf> Buytoast: THIS ORANGE HAVE NOT TAAAAAAAAASTE
<Saturn> 08,01so spike doesn't think of twilight as his mother
<Buytoast> too rare my ass
<Kammerjunk> Alright, yeah, half the film was awkward stuttering.
<LunasGuard> purple scale = purple mane
<TheMaster> Celestia is spikes moms
<OJ> Tear Ducts => Dragons can cry
<otakon> Spazturtle: please God I hope you're wrong
<Buytoast> you've already seen two of em
<Bjornfot> but nah, i'm only hitting on otakon
<fluttercry> 05,15I love history. I love Great Britain. So it all works out.
<Saturn> 08,01as confirmed when he says "you're not mommy"
<Saturn> 08,01but
<cowvarkian> Saturn: why would he, she didnt birth him
<TheMaster> According to Lauren Faust, Celestia raised Spike
<Saturn> 08,01he's been raised by her since he's an egg
<otakon> Saturn: more like a big sister/boss deal
<Daygon> Quest
<Spazturtle> otakon: yeah just joking
<Rookeealding> I had a theory that she "fertilized" that egg...
<Sumica> 00,10polka dots
<Daygon> WHAT
<SuperSanjitenks1989> But then, dragon came in princessian
<cowvarkian> Saturn: he's not a fucking moron
<pony_9000> what!!!
<Saturn> 08,01so does he consider himself as not having a mother?
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn: More like an adopted son, I presume
<otakon> GASP!
<DocSane> Saturn: She's totally his big sister.
<K_A> Saturn: See, when I heard of this ep, I thought he'd be looking for his biological parents.
<otakon> dat sammich
<RAWRity> I tolerate Great Britain
<Fou_Lou> Saturn: Dragons probably arent raised by mothers
<Saturn> 08,01ASoftFluffyThing: but he'd still count her as "mommy"
<CrimsonPhoenix> >Rainbow Dash
<RAWRity> though I like some of their TV
<pony_9000> sandvich
<CrimsonPhoenix> >scared
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Sandvich
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: It's more of a surrogate mother or big sister/ little brother relationship.
<cowvarkian> Saturn: he knows he has one, but doesn't know who she is
<Daygon> Aprons are manly
<otakon> there is NOTHING wrong with aprons
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn: True.
<LunasGuard> what does a duck do after its hatch?
<CloverMuffins> SO MOIST AND DELISHUS
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> cutesy wootsy
<Daygon> Rejected
<cowvarkian> Saturn: its not like he popped out of nothing
<K_A> I think Faust says Celestia raised him at first, and I take her word as canon until shown otherwise in the show.
<Sumica> 00,10more like big sister Saturn
<XylemTube> rarity not helping
<Pale_Horse> You're givingg the fanfic writers material Rarity...
<AJIsAwesome> Saturn: It's more of a surrogate mother or big sister/ little brother relationship.
<Gaston> I wear aprons now. Aprons are cool.
<Randomiser> Aprons are awesome
<LunasGuard> the first one it sees is the mom
<twilight_sprinkle> layin down da law
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: o.O
<naturesfury> damn twi
<magmablock> Maybe dragons are on their own since birth, like sea turtles
<otakon> TIME OUT!
<CrimsonPhoenix> What happened to Season 1 Rainbow Dash that wasn't scared of dragons in Dragonshy
<SuperSanjitenks1989> slap stick from a stick slap
<DocSane> otakon: Admittedly, that pink frilly thing was ultra-girly.,
<AJIsAwesome> SafariMonkey: SOrry. :D
<CloverMuffins> surro... what
<Buytoast> goddamn purple magic, calm down there
<Saturn> 08,01but then, that's really sad, because he doesn't really have a mother figure who *he* sees as a mother figure
<otakon> DocSane: true...
<cowvarkian> LunasGuard: this implies that this show has logic
<OJ> You see, Rarity doesn't know how to deal with the "Spike likes me" thing, so she just ignores it
<Spazturtle> CrimsonPhoenix: There went 100's of them
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> We know
<CloverMuffins> Dashie laying on her back the third time in this episode
<pony_9000> ya
<otakon> Saturn: yeah he doesn't see Twilight as that... wow that is kind of sad
<SirGanjalf> nnnnaughty
<AJIsAwesome> CrimsonPhoenix: Season 1: One dragon. This episode: HUNDREDS.
<Everlasting_Joy> "We know. . ."
<twilight_sprinkle> dont die!
<Gaston> Rainboe Dash is best nut
<TheMaster> He also doesn't have a father figure, but thats not really the ponies fault since the gender ratio is like 1:100
<ASoftFluffyThing> Saturn, and then Spike grew up to be like the dragons in this episode?
<Crippler> KWEST
<Tamazarashi> We're gonna follow him, right?
<cowvarkian> LunasGuard: or that dragons in this show rely soley on instinct
<Daygon> Nutty=Stupid, almost fatal stunts.
<SuperSanjitenks1989> @OJ You are now OJSimpson to us
<pony_9000> quest added
<XylemTube> LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<AlienWarhead> Your Dovakin Quest
<Gaston> yes.
<TheMaster> I wonder how that works anyway...wait, bad thoughts, bad thoughts!
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> of course
<CrimsonPhoenix> of course :D
<OJ> Aw man
<otakon> I love that line
<fluttercry> 05,15There was a plushie of Krackle at Bronycon that sold for several thousand iirc
<SirGanjalf> SPIKEQUEST! doodoodoodoo doo doodooddoo
<CloverMuffins> The Elder Spikes
<Tamazarashi> DUN DUN DUN DUN
<Mutterguy> fluttercry I could imagine
<otakon> a MAGICAL Krackledon
<pony_9000> dun dun
<Saturn> 08,01fluttercry: wow
<red_ony2> I'd lovw to see some more wingless dragons.. :/
<AJIsAwesome> fluttercry: Do you know how much exactly?
<Daygon> Drinking tes is for MEN!
<DocSane> And so Spike travels to Berk for a new Hub/Cartoon Network crossover event.
<otakon> RIDE DAT GOAT!
<OJ> baa baa black sheep have you any wool
<Daygon> Cranky
<Tamazarashi> cranky doodle!
<Saturn> 08,01we had a plushie of our mascot that sold for £1000
<Gaston> The elder scrolls VI: SPIKE
<pony_300> hey wait.... CRANKY
<twilight_sprinkle> he must journey to the throat of the world..
<fluttercry> 05,15I don't remember the exact amount
<Brad[Laptop]> gotta bring the big $$$ out.
<LunasGuard> cowvarkian: one of those two things but my money is on the first
*Mutterguy has Crackles as his FB profile pic
<ASoftFluffyThing> Dat beard
<pony_9000> i guess im playing skyrim now XD
<AlienWarhead> He is known as DovaSpike DRAGONBORN
<cowvarkian> LunasGuard: what, no logic?
<Gaston> Spike is literally Dragonborn
<AJIsAwesome> DAT STRAW HAT <3
<SirGanjalf> By Celestia's Beard!
<fluttercry> 05,15But those of us there watching the auction were just like ".....wut"
<K_A> Wait, maybe this takes place before AFiD when Cranky was still on his search.
<otakon> hiya Red
<CrimsonPhoenix> Relevent to episode http://i.imgur.com/IxrTG.jpg
<ASoftFluffyThing> Hey, it's the dragon from Dragonshy!
<cowvarkian> LunasGuard: well, this show has logic, but its mostly cartoon logic
<SuperSanjitenks1989> @AJIsAwesome You mean Mugiwara
<otakon> I wonder if Red let it on that he was shown up by a little yellow opny
<RAWRity> but hey, PPG movie is next and that film kicks 12 different kinds of ass
<SirGanjalf> pish posh?
<Daygon> Douchebags - dragon form
<Dr_Fumbles> Crackles
<Gaston> PISH POSH
<otakon> a FABULOUSIDON
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: It's fine. I just had it open in pidgin, and was about to log off when a little notification box appeared, saying "It's more of a surrogate mother or big sister/ little brother relationship." It was confusing to say the least.
<CloverMuffins> but the rainbow one kicked me :(
<XylemTube> sEEMS LEIT
<LunasGuard> cowvarkian: yeah yer right
<XylemTube> Seems legit
<Bloxx> dragonbros

<fluttercry> 05,15I never liked PPG that much, but it's been a while, so maybe it'll be different
<SafariMonkey> AJIsAwesome: We all do it. :P

<Gaston> ERMAGERD DREGGUNS
<XylemTube> Is it just me or is the dragon's art style much different?
<RAWRity> trust me, the movie is pretty different from the show in terms of tone, but it's honestly one of the best Super Hero movies I've ever seen.
<Quick_Thinker> otakon you in my skype call im saying the same thing

<IshSexiestPony> more importantly, you like something that other people like?

<Bjornfot> MOLESTED, yes...
<CrimsonPhoenix> lol letter
<LunasGuard> :D
<otakon> fluttercry: well teenage dragons apparantly
<SafariMonkey> cowvarkian: I haven't been using ubuntu recently, and had forgotten that Pidgin used notifications for messages (otherwise it's just program info stuff) so it was a bit confusing
<cowvarkian> Dr_Fumbles: somewhere
<CloverMuffins> if a pony is my love does that make me part pony? :3
<RAWRity> You dolts just seem to think criticism means I hate everything.
<Crippler> HAW HAW
<fluttercry> 05,15If it's different from the show then that already gives it some points
<otakon> and then Celestia shows up
<OJ> Dr_Fumbles: There were no female Orcs
<AlienWarhead> Why are the younger dragon humanoid and the older ones look full dragon
<Tamazarashi> and thren Celestia came and murdered them
<Pale_Horse> Most Frat boys don't have the ability to breath fire, fly, and devour princesses. :P
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 sent to the moon
<otakon> TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
<Dr_Fumbles> lol
<Somebronysss> INB4 CELESTIA KILLS THEM ALL

<magmablock> He's friends with God? Pft, what a loser!
<Kammerjunk> I don't know, I can't really remember last week.
<J_E_Smith71> No Namby Pamby is the paper editor
<AlienWarhead> twiface
<Spazturtle> Yeah I think celestia should have shown up in the epp
<SirGanjalf> That HERESY must not be tolerated!
<Everlasting_Joy> As if Celestia is a threat to dragons.
<twilight_sprinkle> poni centipede
<otakon> J_E_Smith71: you're right!
<cowvarkian> OJ: well, then are the mothers just feminine males?
<pony_9000> not the face
<K_A> "Spike's pen pals with the most powerful creature in the land who controls celestial bodies. HOW PATHETIC!"
<otakon> Everlasting_Joy: she RAISES THE GODDAMN SUN
<CloverMuffins> hey Dashie, u got something on ur face
<AJIsAwesome> That letter was about Spike's parents.
<Everlasting_Joy> otakon: So?

<AppleDashFan982838> not the best epiwode
<Jesse_> I go on funnyjunk and 4chan
<LunasGuard> Ryunosuke: i was just think that
<otakon> AlienWarhead: well it would be too dangerous to try to return it now by himself. They can't teleport back and the predator's probably layed low when the dragon's were flying overheard, which is why Spike had no issues walking through the Everfree.

<Brad[Laptop]> spike is best pony
<MakerDusk> fluttercry: now you've cause mass whining
<MrBen> THAT'S RIGHT, we had the lotto on Friday last week.

<J_E_Smith71> Ryunosuke: Tomorrow, it alters from week to week
<Rookeealding> ... and well.. he is
<MrBen> We alternate.

<CloverMuffins> K_A: ok, thank you, that's reassuring ^^

<MrBen> J_E_Smith71: Yeah, I realize we alternate weeks, but I didn't realize that we showed the old intermission on the days we don't have the lotto.
<Yahooz> OH
<Sumica> 00,10back in the day we randomly pulled names from the channle list and just had them pick a movie on the spot
<cowvarkian> p4ngya: magic
<MakerDusk> p4ngya: by rigging it, duh :p
<CrimsonPhoenix> I love this intermission more than the new one
<CloverMuffins> ^
<J_E_Smith71> p4ngya: I mean the day we do the lotto alternates
<cowvarkian> Sumica: Id like that
<TheMaster> its simple logic. The birds can't do much to defend an egg if a predator is insistent. Its easier to just make a new egg than be eaten and lose the egg anyway
<CloverMuffins> this takes me way way back
<p4ngya> ooohhhhh
<Yahooz> MakerDusk: i was able to sleep-listen in Philosophy today :3
<sonicandmario85> EY LOOK ITS DA INTERMISSION
<MakerDusk> Yahooz: I've been around for the episode and the movie before it

<Sumica> 00,10well it's not realy somthing we have to do with the intermition. But seeing as Caramel and Shizu both worked hard on the videos it would be more fair to use both based on our needs

<J_E_Smith71> You know if Lauren had done FiM before this she probably would have snuck in ponies in here (Like they did with Jigglypuff a couple times)
<K_A> I was off a moment, but let me say if it hasn't been stated that if the Internet became as permeated as it is now less than a decade when this showed (god time passes), this would've basically been what MLP is now.
<LunasGuard> crossfire
<sub06905> mlg sandwich skills
<Bronysith> NEVER LEAVE THE CRUSTS ON

<K_A> 8/10. It started weak at the beginning because it felt like they were just showing off the fact that it was a movie. Also, I kinda prefer a movie that starts a new adventure rather than recounting the origin or background story. But this pulls it off well, especially at the turning point into awesomeness when Mojo's plan reaches fruition.

<Dark92Enigma-> WHAT CAN I SAY? the animation is awesome, the soundtrack kicks ass, the story is engaging, BUT It can drag for TOO LONG....IT ISN'T until 30 minutes when we finally see the plot going full speed ahead......and it isn't until 1 hour when the action finally begins..........ASIDE from that, the girls are great, Mojo is a great TRAGIC character, and for what it holds up, it's a decent Introduction for the PPG

<pony_9001> show us the factory plz
<J_E_Smith71> …with Season 3 you’ll have an uneven 65. With you eliminating episodes, you’ll have three left at the end of the cycle. Will you guys have to do an “odd” week and show three eps so you can show them all, or will one episode not get shown?
<AlienWarhead> fluttercry She can't be perfect so one flaw is being lazy
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> then somepony got hit by that jackhammer and died
<otakon> and commence the ogling
<CloverMuffins> yeah, just because you're not indoctrinated like everypony else has to mean you're a failure. if you wanna judge a person or pony by their scholar achievements then why do you not tell Einstein that he's a failure

<AlienWarhead> fluttercry it is possible that she went though public school and flight school was training for a job in cloudales, but she couldn't handle it and got a job in ponyville
<cachi01> BOOOO BOOOOO I'VE SEEN BETTER!
<otakon> dem bolts of wonder
<Canadian_Brony> ntfwc sounds 'bout right
<Jesse_> DERPY AGAIN
<CloverMuffins> fluttercry you're so boring with your have-to-go-to-school-and-work attitude. no creativity. no offense though
<AJIsAwesome> 2! AH AH AH!
<Tamazarashi> DOCTOR HOOVES!!!!!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> dat non dr.

<Canadian_Brony> if Dr. Whooves had a teenage voice and wings
<fluttercry> 05,15CloverMuffins dem's da cold facts of life.

<otakon> LET'S DO THIS!
<Rosfox> LEROY JENKINS
<cachi01> LEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY
<Kawaii_icybeauti> DO A BARREL ROLL
<fluttercry> 05,15AlienWarhead in that case, she's still a dropout. BUT WHATEVER! It's just a cartoon
<cachi01> JENKIIIIIIIIN
<Tamazarashi> DO A BARREL ROLL
<pony_9001> :P
<AJIsAwesome> BARREL ROLL!
<Jesse_> DO A BARREL ROLL!
<Conyst> At least he has hay fries.
<AJIsAwesome> BARREL ROLL!
<otakon> DO A BARREL ROLL!
<otakon> dammit late
<Jesse_> Dat Rainbow Dash
<AJIsAwesome> Uggh :S
<otakon> Se saw G3.6 Scootaloo
<AlienWarhead> fluttercry but I love talking to you about Rainbow Dash
<Conyst> It burns
<cachi01> inb4 lord of the rings
<Dark92Enigma> DO A BARREL ROLL!
<Canadian_Brony> otakon :O
<twilight_sprinkle> thats some poor planning if they didnt leave enough time fr everyone
<Tamazarashi> Rarity, this episode, I really really really really hate you.
<otakon> I'm sorry but Rarity looks off in that outift
<AJIsAwesome> MY EYES!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Canadian_Brony> 15! And 4
<otakon> She looks trashy
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: I think that's the point.
<CriticKitten> >signed up 15 flyers
<Jesse_> Rarity is a bitch in this episode.
<CriticKitten> >only time for 14
<twilight_sprinkle> Canadian_Brony: contestant number 15 fctorial? dayum
<Kawaii_icybeauti> she's still my favorite.
<AJIsAwesome> Uggh, did you look in a mirror Rairty? :S
<Conyst> Instead of a lord you would have a Queen
<otakon> dat rock and roll
<Rex_Ivan> I have to wonder what music Rainbow hadplaned
<twilight_sprinkle> *factorial
<pony_9001> awwww bs
<XylemTube> Jesse_: Agreed
<Biggysweet> go back to your home on whore island. That is what i hear when i see rarity here
<cachi01> inb4 the offspring
<AJIsAwesome> BONK!
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Biggysweet: Dat ron burgendy.
<otakon> If she cut back on the lipstick and eyeshadow she'd be okay I guess
<Tamazarashi> Rarity, do you mind if I RIP YOUR WINGS OFF??!?!!
<Jesse_> So much for being the element of generosity, she should have just taken Rainbow Dash's feelings into consideration, instead of humiliating her like this.
<AlienWarhead> fluttercry: no hard feelings <3
<Rex_Ivan> and Rarity ISN'T a bitch here. We've ALL been caught up in popularity contests before
<fluttercry> 05,15But you know what. No matter how bad Rarity is in this, it's still not as bad as Mysterious Mare Do Well
<cachi01> Jesse_: she is humilating herself :I
<CloverMuffins> fluttercry: no, they're not. you don't need to have an education and/or a job to have a decent life. actually it's a bit contradictory. if you want to live the life of your dreams you must be above everyone else and excel at what you do. being an indoctrinated government boxed person only limits you :)
<otakon> fluttercry: agreed
<Jesse_> XD
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> ASSASSIN!!!!
<CriticKitten> Rex_Ivan: Yeah no, I never have. She's a bitch.
<RAWRity> Why is it people hate on Rarity when an episode brings up HER character flaws, but when the other ponies do it, they're just being well rounded characters?
<Jesse_> The fact that Rarity is there is making her humiliate herself though.
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Ivan: i havent, simply because i nver participated in one :P
<Alister> TREASON !
<Jesse_> She's afraid of Rarity outshining her.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> iccarus....man
<CrimsonPhoenix> and now for the moment that convert most people into the Bronydom
<Somebronysss> I Was one of the provinces in a independence day act.
<cachi01> Jesse_: she is afraid of failing
<Conyst> Not dark but beautiful
<cachi01> just of that
<CrimsonPhoenix> me excluded
<Canadian_Brony> fluttercry I actually like the Mysterious Mare Do-Well costume :(
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> I. AM. RARITY!!!
<Jesse_> What wasn't Derpy in the competition?
<Rex_Ivan> Twilight_sprinkle you have been maybe isolated too much then,
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Ivan: but i agree though, its understandable
<Jesse_> What is this?
<cachi01> wings: fak u rd we do what we want
<XylemTube> Too close to the sun
<ntfwc> I like the hero episode :P
<AlienWarhead> Is Guiles Theme the best song for this scene or is there another one like you got the touch
<fluttercry> 05,15CloverMuffins Because so many artists are having fantastic lives free from poverty. It may be boring, but having a stable and comfortable life is worth more than following dreams
<Kawaii_icybeauti> derpy loves it
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> nope
<RAWRity> Rainbow Dash treats animals like contestents to see which one can earn her admiration? that's fine. Rarity has a disagreement with Sweetie Belle? WORST SISTER EVER.
<Tamazarashi> YES! FALL RARITY, FALL!!!
<Rex_Mundi> Canadian_Brony: I really like the mare-do-well costume, its good.
<CriticKitten> ded
<cachi01> NOPE.gif
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Ivan: lol, implying its right to care about popularity contests :\
<Jesse_> What the hell is going on here? I could have sworn Derpy was competing .
<Kawaii_icybeauti> i remember this part in the scary monster remix
<Jesse_> Let the bitch fall.
<Nex> KO
<LunasGuard> Spitfire!!!
<Canadian_Brony> BEST
<Canadian_Brony> PART
<Somebronysss> INB4 SCARY MONSTER
<Rex_Mundi> twilight_sprinkle: Im not Rex_Ivan!
<cachi01> she is cuming
<pony_9001> dead eye mode activated
<Jesse_> O.O
<Azuredragon> GUILE THEME
<Kawaii_icybeauti> bye bye sound barrier.....
<XylemTube> BOOOOOOSH
<Tamazarashi> WOO HOOOO!!!!!!!
<AlienWarhead> PUNCH HOLES IN THE SKY!!!
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: sorry
<Tamazarashi> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
<Fou_Lou> Jesse_: derpy was in fact competing
<Jesse_> RAINBOOM!
<CrimsonPhoenix> D:
<cachi01> INB4 THE OFFSPRING
<Tamazarashi> SONIC RAINBOOM!!!!!
*Dark92Enigma Insert Guile's theme
<pony_9001> booooooooom!!!!!!!!!
<Jesse_> Yeah but now she was in the watching stands
<Canadian_Brony> cachi01 I love that PMV
<weeping_pegasi82> so awesome /)^3^(\
<cachi01> Canadian_Brony: we all do =D
<Jesse_> I saw Derpy competing and then in the bleachers
<Kawaii_icybeauti> DAYUM!
<Jesse_> Wat?
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: wait, i didnt ping you
*Canadian_Brony cheers
<cachi01> IMAGINATIOOOOOOOON
<Rex_Ivan> Twilight_sprinkle : perhaps it isn't , but it unfortunately happens if you get caught up in things too much
<pony_9001> wooooo
<J_E_Smith71> Jesse_: Cause Derpy's like Pinkie she defies logic
<Jesse_> xd
<Dark92Enigma> YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
<Fou_Lou> Jesse_: yeah like 5 times. but besides that derpy already had her performance
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> best day ever
<RAWRity> Jesse_: you know that usually after you compete in something, you watch the rest of the contest, right?
<weeping_pegasi82> green pony
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Ivan: i understand that.
<CrimsonPhoenix> there
<CrimsonPhoenix> she lost her head
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttercry: thats subjective
<Jesse_> Yeah, but there's like a place where competitors go to watch it.
<CrimsonPhoenix> she wasn't herself
<cachi01> AND TOMORROW NO ONE GAVE A SHIT
<CloverMuffins> fluttercry: that's why i said it's not very creative. i'm not saying it's wrong to live like that, because it's not, but you shouldn't judge a person or itc a pony about their choices in life. Dashie dropped out of school yet still is the best flier ever. she took matters into her own hooves ;)
<Dark92Enigma> D'aaaaaaaaaaawwww Rainbow teared up a bit
<XylemTube> "you saved my life" Death is canon
<Jesse_> They don't go into the stands to watch it.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> fangirl moment
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttercry: i dont know if i would want to live a boring monotonous life of doing something i dont like
<J_E_Smith71> Heh it's funny Sumi comments on how much RD is able to carry back on Dragon Quest and here we are in the ep we was bringing up
<Dark92Enigma> OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
<Kawaii_icybeauti> ermergerd!
<Jesse_> She was in the public stands watching it, Derpy defies reasoning.
<pony_9001> oh my gosh
<Canadian_Brony> RD's such a fangirl
<Jesse_> OHMIGOSH
<Canadian_Brony> I love it
<Fenr> :D
<CriticKitten> Fangirl adorableness
<cachi01> noooooo
<Azuredragon> wingboner
<pony_9001> omgomgomg
<Biggysweet> ermergerd der wernderberlters
<sub06905> ^
<otakon> Fangirl Rainbow Dash
<fluttercry> 05,15twilight_sprinkle would you rather live as a starving artist/writer, struggling to get by month to month?
<pony_9001> :D
<otakon> Love her
<Silver_Spoon> rainbow didn't bow...
<Rex_Ivan> critickitten : I hope your relationships never dissapoint you. This may be hard to do
<CrimsonPhoenix> not biased at all by the way
<Rookeealding> Technically Rairty made that competiion much better.
<J_E_Smith71> Rainbow Dash acts like a Brony who runs into Lauren or Tara on the street
<XylemTube> ommigosh
<Dark92Enigma> OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
<pony_9001> derpy
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Me when I saw tara strong
<Jesse_> OHMIGOSH
<Conyst> Lyra enjoyed the show.
<Rookeealding> Falling to your death is a real climax
<RAWRity> fluttercry: some would, yes.
<Canadian_Brony> I dare her to say something besides "OHMIGOSH"
<Jesse_> Nothing not a damn thing
<CriticKitten> Rex_Ivan: Too late.
<cachi01> TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
<Jesse_> Would have been funny if Twilight said that :P
<pony_9001> free falling
<CrimsonPhoenix> soooo this episode....
<Jesse_> Best wedding ever.
<CrimsonPhoenix> a Rainbow Dash episode or a Rarity episode?
<Candy> flank
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttercry i dont really care for writing, so i dont know how it is for writers or artists. but maybe i would, it depends on many things
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix will not be seen for a minimum of SIX MONTHS!!!
<CrimsonPhoenix> cause it was Rarity that learn the lesson
<cachi01> best wedding ever. best day ever. best pet ever
<Nex> *wink*
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> shes gonna GET SOME!!!
<Tamazarashi> Is that...two soarins?
<pony_9001> you cant do it
<XylemTube> Definitly a RD ep
<Jesse_> O.O
<Jesse_> Even Soarin defies logic.
<Tamazarashi> THE END
<J_E_Smith71> And then they screwed, the end
<cachi01> IFUKNOWWHATIMEAN.jpg
<Biggysweet> nice Rarity episode 10/10
<Dark92Enigma> cachi01: Best____EVER!
<Canadian_Brony> CrimsonPhoenix that is, Sonic Rainboom won't be shown for six months minimum

<Luna> 07,01And with that I bid you all adieu take care everypony and see you hopefuly tomorrow
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> Fou_Lou: dream of ponies
<Rex_Ivan> Critickitten : it's a fine thing to set standards, but when no one meets them, you may want to loosen them up a bit
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttercry: if i didnt have to support anyone, then i mightve chosen to try and pursue. it really comes down to whether a person is willing to take a risk for doing what he likes
<Canadian_Brony> g'night Nittany_Discord

<Kawaii_icybeauti> TOOOO THE MOOOOOOOONNNN
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> YOU'RE BANNED
<fluttercry> 05,15twilight_sprinkle the point is, if someone has no education, or chooses a field of work that isn't very stable just because he likes it, their life isn't going to be nearly as easy or comfortable
<Jesse_> Make it okaaaaaay

<Kawaii_icybeauti> dat dragonforce...
<Kurra> yaaay!
<Dark92Enigma> THANK you everypony f0r attending the second delivery of NOSTALGIAWEEN........see you all tommorrow for the re-run and goodnight!
<twilight_sprinkle> fluttercry: obviously, but at the same time, if they can make it, itll be a lot better than having an average life. so it really depends if you are ok with living an average life, and how willing you are to take a risk
<otakon> nice
<CrimsonPhoenix> fluttercry, I have a full time job and I'm working my way on getting somewhere in acting
<RAWRity> flutterchu: true, but that doesn't mean they'll be unhappy with their life. If going with their passion is more important to them than stability, then who are we to tell them not to go for it?
<Kurra> Dragonforce!
<AlienWarhead> bye Dark92Enigma
<cachi01> Dragonforce!

<fluttercry> 05,15In the end though, people can do whatever they want. Even if in my opinion it's dumb, whatver makes them happy right?
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: not really, actually. It all depends on what you do with life. "Average" is what YOU make it.

<weeping_pegasi82> uhhh
<otakon> WAT!?
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: actually they do. They ensure you have the skills and knowledge necessary to get a job and perform well in the field you've chosen. For instance, not just anybody knows how to make an image of a hard drive and analyze the information taken from it, thus not everyone can get a jow in computer forensics or data recovery
<owloysius> hahha
<Jesse_> When does Movie Night continue? O.o

<AJIsAwesome> Dr_Fumbles: Me neither. I'm sure it's more of an acquired taste.
<Luna123> cube!
<twilight_sprinkle> RAWRity: but that doesnt m,ean there are available job spots. many programmers learned programming by themselves, its a popular field
<Everlasting_Joy> Oh yay!

<thelonepony> :D
<RAWRity> twilight_sprinkle: but actually having a degree makes you much more likely to get a position with an employer than somebody with no reputable credentials.

<Canadian_Brony> Hey, who wants to hear my Gordan Freeman impression?

<Azuredragon> cant*
<otakon> Azuredragon: in the lab, but not OUT of it I don't think

<PaladinDrakkenwolf> damn
<Everlasting_Joy> cachi01: That.
<Canadian_Brony> it's scary
<cachi01> otakon: i think its when gordon meets chell
<VenHur> Imagine if such ending existed, Valve would of have a genuine idea to combine two beloved games, and mix them into Jesus Christ's favorite flavor.

<Kawaii_icybeauti> sub06905: Wait, what's that?
<otakon> well so much for that
<Quick_Thinker> uh nvm
<AJIsAwesome> This is strange. Not really terrible, but strange. :S
<Derpy_Hooves> teacher used faint
<RAWRity> THIS. IS. GLORIOUS.
<AlienWarhead> teacher was almost cool
<Jesse_> The creators of this show are making it REALLY hard.
<Lambduh> Hello world
<otakon> WHY IS THIS SHOW SO NOISY?
<Derpy_Hooves> it's not very effective
<cachi01> otakon: cause anime
<VenHur> Guys...that's NOT Ms. Keen...
<Cades> hey
<superretroworld> guess the 80s mlp t shirt of the mane 6 has alot of bronies complaining at wal mart, and Ghost is laughing at us :(
<Dark_Horst> otakon: japan
<AlienWarhead> HADOKEN

<CriticKitten> This is....I don't even know what to think about this.
<J_E_Smith71> RAWRity: Yes, and voiced by Tabitha no less
<otakon> WAAAAAAAAAAAT!?

<weeping_pegasi82> of course buttercup has a giant hammer
<CrimsonPhoenix> ACTUAL BUBBLES?

<flutterchu> THIS PLACE SUCK
<CrimsonPhoenix> I....
<otakon> she fights WITH BUBBLES?
<Jesse_> I....
<Dark_Horst> "MY BUBBLES ARETN WORKING" line of the week
<Azuredragon> http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110412192720/powerpuff/images/7/70/Ms.Keane.png
<twilight_sprinkle> the worst thing is their short skirts, they turned the powerpuff girls into your generic anime fanservice girls
<J_E_Smith71> Mercury Bubbles!
<Jesse_> I want to commit suicide...
<Lambduh> How's life?
<owloysius> OMG DERPY:P
<Cades> Pretty good, you?
<RAWRity> CrimsonPhoenix: It's so cracktastic I can't decide if it's awful, amazing, or both.
<Jesse_> This has driven away all of my hope for my life.
<CriticKitten> Someone was snorting before they made this.
<AlienWarhead> Fucking Bubbles!!
<pony_9001> wut da fuck id rather watch rainbow factory
<flutterchu> THIS SHOW SUCKS
<CriticKitten> WAT
<d3rb> Jesse_, i'm there with you, this is terrible
<doctor_whooves127> make sense darn you
<superretroworld> Jesse_: well atleast there isnt a mlp fim anime
<VenHur> I also hates the fact that they uses weapons...like a wand...a hammer....and a yo-yo...
<Mutterguy> Booo
<CrimsonPhoenix> RAWRity, maybe a so bad it's hilarious would fit right in
<Lambduh> Good too
<otakon> CriticKitten: this just proves the drugs in Japan are WAY stronger than what we have here.
<flutterchu> cute bubbles > sexy bubbles
<Jesse_> I'd rather watch the cupcakes video than this shit.
<cachi01> pony_9001: rainbow factory is agood fic :I
<VenHur> Instead of just fighting bare handed.
<CrimsonPhoenix> ....seeing in that angle it might be good
<DocSane> This is not a good show.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> dang it's like kenny...
<pony_9001> yep :3
<ntfwc> well at least her face is still hidden
<twilight_sprinkle> Japan, i am dissappoint
<owloysius> i'd rather watch madoka, but i fucking love madoka
<Everlasting_Joy> O.K. At least they were consistant with Ms. Bellum.
<otakon> and Bellum HAS NO HIPS OR BUST!
<CrimsonPhoenix> and AT LEAST they respect the secretary character
<Dark_Horst> it wouldnt be so bad if they had actaul weapons
<RAWRity> yeah, the animation's kind of crap.
<Kawaii_icybeauti> wait, he has a kid O.O
<Rex_Ivan> HEY
<Dark_Horst> ...did i just hear spikes VA?
<Cypresswolf> WHAT! The Mayor has no hat? :[ BLASPHEMY
<Quick_Thinker> its just the show but in anime cant you appriciate it for that
<otakon> WHERE IS MS. BELLUM'S BOUTIFUL BUST AND HIPS?!?
<Sumica> 00,100_o that looked wrong
<CriticKitten> Hey, remember those characters in Bleach who wield a giant bat and do nothing in every episode? Oh, right, of course you don't BECAUSE THEY'RE FUCKING STUPID. So let's make a show focused entirely around three girls like that!
<J_E_Smith71> Well at least Miss Bellum they hid her face and tried to make the Mayor sound like Tom Kenny
<twilight_sprinkle> running out of power?..
<otakon> Cypresswolf: and no pickles!
<Jesse_> Running out of power? The fuck?
<AJIsAwesome> Sumica: I know right? :S
<otakon> also they run out of power?
<superretroworld> Sumica: :D
<CriticKitten> ....
<Cypresswolf> ^^
<Kawaii_icybeauti> run out of power? WHHHAAAATTT!
<Everlasting_Joy> They have a power source?!

<Kawaii_icybeauti> maybe Cathy has something to do with it...
<VenHur> And since when Professor got a kid and a robot dog?!
<J_E_Smith71> He's the Professor's kid there
<Nex> this is.....
<DocSane> This is like a bad parody of anime as imagined by an American.
<VenHur> JAPAAAAAAAAAN!!!
<Silver_Spoon> wat.png

<Dark_Horst> evil is a flavor now
<Deadlypon3> I do like however, that the assistant does not have her face revealed
<CriticKitten> ....evil flavor.
<Randomiser> The flavor of evil?
<Jesse_> The creators of this show should not breath anymore, they are a waste of oxygen.
<owloysius> mojo jojojo... what the hell was he called?
<otakon> This is wrong
<Mutterguy> I... this is horrible
<CriticKitten> Oh god, that is the worst plot
<VenHur> Just Mojo Jojo.
<CrimsonPhoenix> ROBOT JOJO
<otakon> This is wrong and twisted and bad
<cachi01> oh yeah BTW THE BAD GUY IN THIS IS A FUCKING BLACK SMOKE
<Kawaii_icybeauti> Still better than newborn cuties...
<J_E_Smith71> No Tara, but we have Tabitha, Cathy, and Nicole instead
<CriticKitten> Dear god, is this still going?
<flutterchu> biggest ripoff ever
<Jesse_> Still a better love story than Twilight.
<Cypresswolf> Dammit PPG! You had ONE JOB!
