<Coey890> Fake rhymes with cake, lie rhymes with pie. :p
<Bronysith> but hey
<Bronysith> gladiator is good
<Coey890> IT'S A CONSPIRACY
<Canadian_Brony> Coey890 u c wat I did thar
<Bronysith> if not an overdone concept >.>
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Who won with Mars Attacks? I like that movie, what little of it I have seen
<Coey890> Yeah.
<d3rb> yeah, this joke has dragged on wayy too long :D
<ElectricVelocity> *Pretends to roleplay as a dying roleplayer*
<Iwa> Coey890: So...the fake is a cake!?!
<Dark_Horst> there i leave you guys alone for 5 minutes and suddenly the stream is gone
<Canadian_Brony> -__-
<d3rb> ElectricVelocity, thats deep
<ElectricVelocity> I know.
<jcelios> Hey Wrek I think the stream crashed
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: it's a masterpiece :D
<Canadian_Brony> it's your fault Dark_Horst. I was lurking O__O
<Drew> yeah :(
<ElectricVelocity> I fell into the farthest pits of my mind ages ago.
<Coey890> No, he's just dead for a few minutres.
<Coey890> The extra lives will be deployed soon.
<Bronysith> AssaultWithEmbraces: you dont like gladiator?
<Bronysith> i can understand that
<ElectricVelocity> I have no social life.
<Drew> I hear ya
<Coey890> Anyways, I'm going to go play some games and stufz. Bai :)
<Iwa> Coey890: Bye bye, and have fun

<Drew> Refreshing doesnt help :I
<d3rb> cya alexxm
<Blazing_Beatz> I refreshed...still gone
<soulrider95> I get black
<ElectricVelocity> Is this place usually streaming?
<Drew> Yeah, it's down for some reason
<ElectricVelocity> Oh.
<ElectricVelocity> I came here before the new episode started and it wasn't working.
<MadSurge> I don't really like oily half-naked men fighting :D I wanna see more historically accurate gladiator fights :D
<ElectricVelocity> So I went to BronyTV.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bronysith: I've seen bits and pieces here and there
<Iwa> ElectricVelocity: Most likely the problem is on your end, about 4 to 5K people did get their stream via bronystate :S
<Wrek> 05lemme fix that then
<Bronysith> AssaultWithEmbraces: well watch the whole thing, it is still a good experience
<AssaultWithEmbraces> But MadSurge, what's wrong with oily half-naked men fighting?
<ElectricVelocity> Right.
<Bronysith> AssaultWithEmbraces: NOTHIGN
<Bronysith> nothing wrong with oily men fighting
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Well I can see the oily part being a turn off if they can deep fry something on their chests
<Drew> Check this out http://www.tv.com/features/best-of-2012/vote/poll/SpecialFeatures:list:best-animated-series
<ElectricVelocity> Look at that little picture of the map up in the top left corner. It looks like a pony face kinda.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> But half-naked men in general? Yummy~
<Wrek> 05still nothing
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: I don't like men :D
<Wrek> 05?
<Drew> nothin
<soulrider95> Just refreshed, nothing
<MadSurge> AssaultWithEmbraces: but yes, you can like them :3
<Dark_Horst> nope
<ekips> same here
<PetePuma> maybe the something is broken
<Iwa> Drew: Yup, that was/is a landslide...though pretty sure most of the votes should be void :P
<ElectricVelocity> It's Derpy.
<AssaultWithEmbraces> Bronysith: /)
<Bronysith> (\

<spypengen> those who don't use adblock probably use IE
<Yahooz> with what?
<Bronysith> Yahooz: admiring russel crowe
<AdamTheDuck> IE is best browser to find other browsers
<ElectricVelocity> How'd you know?
<d3rb> those without adblock need to learn to internet
<Yahooz> ...why?
<PetePuma> IE FTL
<Bronysith> over oiled up half naked men
<spypengen> I agree
<Mr_Anybody> hello peoplez
<ElectricVelocity> I like IE.
<Mr_Anybody> I'm here
<AdamTheDuck> Hello Mr_Anybody
<Yahooz> ...why?
<PetePuma> HAI!!!!!
<d3rb> hey Mr_Anybody
<ekips> ohai Mr_Anybody

<Bronysith> and tennant is jizz worthy
<Mr_Anybody> whoa
<Drew> mini map looks like an evil pony now
<ElectricVelocity> What I said.
<ekips> Mr_Anybody There is no learning effect if one is not aware of his mistakes :P
<Lasharus> d3rb, I barely have an idea who's streaming half the time. :P
<Kandarihu> Keep in mind that not everyone uses IE by choice.
<Drew> sorry :P
<Lasharus> Also, what map editor is this?
<Drew> I had to refresh

<Mr_Anybody> same as nick

<Mr_Anybody> yah, so we can play later
<Darf14> cool :)
<Mr_Anybody> come on sb move it up!
<Blaze666DESU> move that gear up
<Mike> One of the admins should set up a voting system taking place all week to decide what to stream during the next week.
<Mr_Anybody> nah
<Mr_Anybody> to much work
<Darf14> err... to be honest im not good at finding names on TF2. but my name is the same as my bronystate name :$
<Mr_Anybody> alrighty than
<Mike> But then we could host a 24hr stream.
<Mr_Anybody> i'll accept it later, i'm on my laptop and o don't have steeam on it
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> hey everypony :)
<Mike> Sup.
<Mr_Anybody> HERRO!
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Darf14> ok
<Mike> Or posibly the ability to stream from a pre-chosen users computer so we could have a constant stream.
<Mr_Anybody> THAT Sketch_Toku_Brony IS A BLOODY SPY!
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Mr_Anybody: nooo >_>
*Mr_Anybody explodes Sketch_Toku_Brony
<Mr_Anybody> KABOOM!
<AdamTheDuck> Is there a stream at the moment?
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> lol
<Darf14> Sg. Blaze666 is that right?
<Kinixys> Hi AdamTheDuck. I don't think so.
<Mr_Anybody> oh there going to have to glue you back together, IN HELL!
<Drew> Gmod http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQqkbiVVLzA
<Mike> Nope, so I was discussing possible ways to have a 24hr stream.
<Ghosties> 04Evening everyone, just want to take a second to remind you to not pay any attention to any PMs sent to you by the user "incog" That is all, thank you.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai Ghosties.
<Mr_Anybody> DARN REVERSE PYCOLIGY
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> you got it Ghosties
<prince-dari> If you're not on the site embed it would be best just to /ignore him
<Mr_Anybody> now i'm going to want to see it ;~;
<prince-dari> He's PMing malware to people
<Zacklego> Whats streaming?
<Darf14> AHH!! A GHOS...oh its just Ghosties , never mind
<Mr_Anybody> giggle at him
<Zacklego> Twitch is being an ass to me right now
<Mike> Nothing is streaming.
<twixie_sprinkle> thanks for the warning, Ghosties and prince-dari
<Mr_Anybody> dat square
<Darf14> incog? ........seems legit
<twixie_sprinkle> Mr_Anybody: some random encoding error i get, idk why
<CriticKitten> Ignored. Thanks for the headsup.
<Derpy_Hooves> fom what i've heard
<Derpy_Hooves> he's part of GNAA
<Ryunosuke> thanks for the warning
<Darf14> GNAA?
<Ghosties> 04Just pay heed and ignore him
<Mike> Prince-Dari: Someone should figure out a system for 24-hour streams where it would piggyback on a random active user, showing what they're doing, so we can have constant stream.
<twixie_sprinkle> Derpy_Hooves: well its what he says
<Mr_Anybody> i have anti-virus so even if he did i wouldn't get it in ma system :$
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> Ghosties: got it,um do we just close the channel if it pops up? just asking to be sure
<Mike> I would just hope someone isn't watching porn.
<Ghosties> 04Just close the PM
<prince-dari> Well for one, that would require all users to run software to be streaming all the time, two it sounds incredibly complicated to set up, three they could show explicit content
<Mr_Anybody> >_>
<twixie_sprinkle> Darf14: gay nigger association of america, perhaps the people who messed with the stream that one time, but perhaps not
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> got it thanks Ghosties :)
<Zacklego> That would be..... wait wouldnt they have to accept the invitation?
<Ghosties> 04What he does is he sends the malware via links through PM
<Mr_Anybody> I'm totally not Mike >_>
<Ghosties> 04Yep, no problem Sketch
<Darf14> twixie_sprinkle: really? I thought it was /v/ the whole time, I guess I owe them a apology :(
<Mr_Anybody> thanks Ghosties now I GIGGLE AT YOU!
<Drew> you're allowed to shair youtube vids when it's not streaming right?
<twixie_sprinkle> Darf14: well nobody really knows who it was, but its very unlikely it was /v/
<Mike> Mr_Anybody: 'Tis fine. I totally don't visit the artist Braeburned's e621 page.
<Mr_Anybody> me either >_>
<twixie_sprinkle> yes Drew ,as long as its appropraite

<Mike> Darf14: Found my sumarization i had saved
<Rainbow_Chicken> 'K thanks
<Darf14> coold
<Mike> Darf14:Someone mentioned Pegasi wings, and that their magic lets them fly. I then theorized that magic needs a focal point(A pointy object, something or other), hence Wands, Unicorn Horns, and Pegasi feathers. Some things are better at 'conducting' magic, if you will. Earth ponies have no focal point, thus the constant emanation of magic causing plants to grow.Why gems are good stores of magic was then asked: and i answered with ano

<HoodEvee> Either way, Zombies
<HoodEvee> Vague yet obvious

*jojoyasmin opens google

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Yesh :D
<Mr_Anybody> your momas so fat when she wore a yellow shirt people thought she was the shcool bus
<Saturn> 08,01doesn't de broglie wavelength decrease as mass increases?
<Mr_Anybody> school*
<jojoyasmin> Not these jokes...
<Artifact> Mr_Anybody: :D
<Saturn> 08,01because it has more energy, becase E = mc^2?
<twixie_sprinkle> i think de broglie wave is h/p
<jojoyasmin> .......
<Saturn> 08,01frequency increases
<twixie_sprinkle> it also depends on the speed, as well as mass
<Saturn> 08,01so wavelength decreases?
<twixie_sprinkle> bigger mass, smaller wavelength
<Saturn> 08,01aye
<Mr_Anybody> your moma's so fat her drinvers lisence test was on a dino
<Artifact> heh nintendo times
<Mr_Anybody> old i meant
<Ghosties> 04Gettin' all sciency up in 'ere

<Artifact> YOUR MOM HAS MONEY FOR ASTROTOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT
<twixie_sprinkle> Prince_Blueblood: okay, but leave some of it, i still need it o.o
<SuperBrony64> 11,02hmmm...guess you are right, the de Broglie wavelength is inversely proportional to momentum...and since velocity doesn't change, the mass has to.
<Ghosties> 04I still talk with him but he's busy helping out at other pony sites
<XAX> Good on him.
<twixie_sprinkle> SuperBrony64: YOU FAIL, YOU GET NOTHING, GOOD DAY SIR

Twitch has these strict requirements about streaming using an iFrame which has a workaround as long as you use a non-Chrome browser. I can only stream my consoles using my newer and better capture card using Twitch.

<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> wut
<AJIsAwesome> What's wrong with Zelda?
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> lel
<Chrysalis> slow boring, uninteresting story
<jojoyasmin> Zelda. Is. Amazing.
<geeky> CTHULHU: i was sacrfing some ones new born for you
<Chrysalis> No. It. Isn't
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> zelda is ok
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> :I
<Tyler_The_Creator> dafuq is this
<Chrysalis> massively overrated
<jojoyasmin> My soul...
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 netfliz
<Ryunosuke> .....
<weylin|Blarg> I was raised on Zelda .-.
<AJIsAwesome> I like Zelda. I don't love it, but I like it.
<Moopy> Hey Sorry SuperBrony64 but a xbox FTW so....................sorry dude
<Chrysalis> i was raised on duke nukem and quake
<Ryunosuke> okay.... after reading this story, I can officially say that humans... as a species.... is SERIOUSLY messed up
<Ryunosuke> in the head
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> sadly they changed the music in the remastered version of budokai 3
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> :<
<jojoyasmin> Actually it depends on what zelda games you're talking about because I don't like a few.
<CTHULHU> Did you eat it and drink its blood? Remember waste not want not.
<aniderp> hi
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, aniderp.
<Ryunosuke> 'lo aniderp
<weylin|Blarg> 'ello, aniderp!
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Moopy: Sorry...Xbox is last gen...sorry :(
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> ello aniderp
<Moopy> Hmph
<Chrysalis> SuperBrony64 so is the wiiu
<geeky> alo aniderp
<Chrysalis> its only just caught up
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Chrysalis: Next gen~
<Chrysalis> but then they waste so much potential with that POS controller
<Moopy> But still xbox is freakin way better the wii U console so yeah
<Chrysalis> remove that controller
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> lel
<Chrysalis> rebuild the CPU/GPU
<jojoyasmin> I miss my xbox before it was destroyed by a glass of water. And then I got the 360.
<Chrysalis> then you can call it next gen
<Ryunosuke> SNES
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Chrysalis> nintendo lost the plot since the '64
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> so what you planning to play on teh xbox SuperBrony64?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02I still got the plot~
<Ryunosuke> well tbh, they did drop the ball since the psx/SNEScd fiasco
<Kimori> goodnight
<Afflict> night
<Moopy> But heres the thing though i play the wii console sometimes but not all the time im just more into the xbox consoles so xbox elite FTW yay
<jojoyasmin> What's the point of the Wii U? It seems pointless for me to upgrade.
<Chrysalis> jojoyasmin the point is to give ninendo money
<jojoyasmin> Pfft. Mine.
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> ghost nappa!
<AJIsAwesome> sub06905|DBZ_Budokai: VEGETA~
<Chrysalis> then again, all 3 consoles make the same mistake
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 how long has i been offline?
<Chrysalis> no cross-platform multiplayer
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> AJIsAwesome: :D
<JRP2234> 0_0
<AJIsAwesome> ?
<jojoyasmin> ...
<Ryunosuke> the problem I see, is xbox/microsoft
<Ryunosuke> Chrysalis:
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 talk to us
<jojoyasmin> What?
<Chrysalis> serioulsy, just hook em all up to the same servers
<AJIsAwesome> ???
<Ryunosuke> nono
<Chrysalis> and let the PC dominate the console players
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 is that you talking
<CTHULHU> But console is better.
<Ryunosuke> the problem is microsoft wants to charge for every game patch, every expansion, etc
<Chrysalis> CTHULHU you are misguided
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: no o.o
<JRP2234> hmm
<CTHULHU> How so sir?
<Chrysalis> pcs are better in almost every regard
<Chrysalis> faster, more powerful, more flexible
<Chrysalis> free online
<Chrysalis> cheaper games
<CTHULHU> in what way?
<jojoyasmin> ...
<Ryunosuke> see: TF2, Dust514 (and why they went with PS3 instead of XBox
<Moopy> so what it doesn't mattter about the charges dude its about having fun on the console so yeah
<geeky> ffjsdlkfjslafjsafj;sfjs;lajfs;
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 hows voic can i hear?
<CTHULHU> Moopy's right.
<AJIsAwesome> Moopy: Actually, the charges are important as well.
<Chrysalis> All i do on my pc is play games
<Moopy> teh whatever man
<Chrysalis> so that argument really doesnt hold
<Ryunosuke> its not so much a hardware incompatability, its the business... style between Microsoft and Sony
<Ryunosuke> and the game designers
<Moopy> blah blah blah blah yeah right................hmph
<Chrysalis> oh yeah, its easy enough to make the systems play with eachother, see brink and *game i forgot the name of*
<SkunkTauri> Hello Everypony :3
<jojoyasmin> Yo
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, SkunkTauri.
<Chrysalis> problem is console players dont like playing people who can actually PLAY the damn games
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> ello SkunkTauri
<Chrysalis> rather than rely on autoaim
<Chrysalis> and autoaim is not a result of the controller
<Moopy> see even for me dude all i do is try to have fun on the xbox elite console and talk to my friends thats all i do so yeah
<Chrysalis> you can be just as good on a controller as a KB/M
<Sumica> 00,10dat off line
<Moopy> Oh hi there sumica
<Chrysalis> ohai sumi
<AJIsAwesome> I hope SB knows the stream's offline.
<Sumica> 00,10ohhi
<jojoyasmin> I really don't like playing online with people. They just sit there and yell at you because they're being an idiot and blaming you.
<weylin|Blarg> ^
<SuperBrony64> 11,02HAi Sumica :)
<Ryunosuke> jojoyasmin: you arent playing with the right people :)

<Ryunosuke> also hi sumica
<Moopy> so what dude we all get freakin blamed so what big freakin deal man jeese
<AJIsAwesome> I've had both positive and negative experiences with online people, but I still enjoy it.
<jojoyasmin> Ryunosuke: I would if my friends played the same games as me :P
<Ryunosuke> :)
<Chrysalis> again, its a system thing
<Ryunosuke> same here AJIsAwesome
<Chrysalis> iv never had whiny kids on pc
<Chrysalis> but i have on my xbox
<geeky> eggs
<geeky> AJIsAwesome: eggs
<Ryunosuke> Chrysalis: 3 words
<Chrysalis> hell, the games even play better
<Ryunosuke> Team. Death. Match. :)
<jojoyasmin> Everytime on the xbox. *playing the game correctly*
<Chrysalis> cite: BlOps on xbox/pc both with a controller
<Moopy> And this is why i play the xbox elite to talk to my friends online thats what i ever do so deal with it dude
<Chrysalis> the pc plays smoother and faster

<weylin|Blarg> It always feels good to headshot little kids out of left field, then hear then complain, imo
<Invi> SuperBrony64, then who's voice am I hearing on the Sb stream?

<Chrysalis> c)texture packs
<Moopy> teh i don't care about that

<smallchild1024> barely any room for exploration
<Chrysalis> e) mods
<AJIsAwesome> SB, I think we get it. :D
<Chrysalis> f)skins
<d3rb> hold, im writing notes
<Sumica> 00,10So you are saying the PC master race wins yet again
<jojoyasmin> Damn you people! I'm probably going to open minecraft again
<Chrysalis> g) loads of items / blocks
<d3rb> push....button....open...door
<Chrysalis> h) upside down blocks
<Buytoast> It's true.
<smallchild1024> they need to implement infinite terrain for the xbox
<Buytoast> PC is the master race.
<AJIsAwesome> SB, why do you have fire directly below you? ._.
<Chrysalis> smallchild1024 they can't
<d3rb> ^]
<Chrysalis> the xbox physically can't handle a bigger world
<Moopy> whats a terrain?
*Chrysalis facedesks
<Jmo> Wow.
<Jmo> Seriously.
<Sumica> 00,10cause he likes warm floors
<Ryunosuke> ....
<jojoyasmin> ...
<jojoyasmin> What?
<AJIsAwesome> Moopy: A piece of ground having specific characteristics or military potential.
<smallchild1024> i've seen how much the xbox can't handle from playing other games co op online
*SpeccyRush is having an aneurysm
<Moopy> booooooo!
<weylin|Blarg> i'm headed for bed. later, all
<AJIsAwesome> BYe, weylin|Blarg.
<Chrysalis> terrain -> Gameworld
<AJIsAwesome> Sheesh, that's a fast cart.
<CTHULHU> nothing can be endless.
<Chrysalis> i have mined out larger areas than the xbox can even store
<Chrysalis> CTHULHU the pc version supports 2billion blocks
<Jmo> 'Nothing can be endless'
<Jmo> LOL
<SpeccyRush> SuperBrony64: just put the ladder 1 block higher
<aniderp> dat jaymoo
<CTHULHU> and?
<d3rb> http://1-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/a/image/1345/70/1345705036366.jpg
<Chrysalis> it would take several MONTHS of non stop travelling to hit that limit
<jojoyasmin> Well fuck you too twitch. It hasn't been showing me the stream and I wouldn't have known it was on without the chat
<Chrysalis> xbox would only take an hour or so
<Sumica> 00,10well there is a mode that has a game world larger then the earth
<CTHULHU> thats not so great.
<Moopy> Well im going to play some minecraft on my xbox elite but i'll still be here in the chat so yeah
<Sumica> 00,10but, the save game would be larger then our current abilty to store
<d3rb> really?
<Chrysalis> seen the middle earth map?
<Chrysalis> recreating the entirity of middlearth in minecraft
<Chrysalis> looks damn good
<Sumica> 00,10they dont make a harddrive big enough to save said game
<SpeccyRush> PC Minecraft world has the potential to be 8 times the size of the Earth
<Chrysalis> also
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Nightly Roundup #520
<Chrysalis> pc realises gamers know how to play games
<Chrysalis> xbox has to give a tutorial
<CTHULHU> I cant get into minecraft it looks like to much work.
<Chrysalis> too
<Sumica> 00,10PC has web pages taht are easaly accesd
<Chrysalis> much work?
<Sumica> 00,10they have tutorials
<jojoyasmin> Depends on how you play.
*Chrysalis twitches
<SpeccyRush> punch tree how hard is that
<Chrysalis> huh, my current game world is 6 times larger than the xbox can create
<jojoyasmin> If you prefer survival and doing things legit, then yeah there's a bit of time involved.
<SpeccyRush> use wood to make tools use tools to get better materials rinse and repeat
<Chrysalis> theres another difference
<jojoyasmin> But creative mode, if you prefer that, it doesn't take much time to build.
<Chrysalis> pc, zombies can break doors down
<geeky> moo
<CTHULHU> thats not one of the rules.
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> well xbox is behind in updates :I
<smallchild1024> if the xbox could support java, there wouldn't be as many update problems
<Chrysalis> MS wouldnt let it support java though
<Tyler_The_Creator> ll
<Chrysalis> the xbox really wouldnt like it
<Chrysalis> hardware wouldnt handle it well
<CTHULHU> how so?
<jojoyasmin> I hate when I can't get through doors...
<smallchild1024> but the reason the game runs so smooth on xbox is because its written in c++ and the code is more efficient than java
<jojoyasmin> And then I run at them ten times
<Chrysalis> oh yeah, more food types on the pc
<djblazekin> is this happenning
<Chrysalis> your not destined to just eat bread
<CTHULHU> but bread s good.
<jojoyasmin> The game has to constantly tell you how to do things (e.g., the buttons on the bottom left)
<djblazekin> what do you zapp apples would taste like irl
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> spicy?
<d3rb> awesome
<smallchild1024> sour?
<Chrysalis> does the xbox have the end yet?
<AJIsAwesome> Like Zap Apples?
<Chrysalis> or hardcore mode
<smallchild1024> the xbox couldn't handle the end
<Chrysalis> doubtful the players could handle hardcore
<smallchild1024> and with limited map sizes, finding a stronghold is nearly impossible
<jojoyasmin> That creeper made me jump ._.
<djblazekin> why is justin tv being stupid
<AJIsAwesome> djblazekin: What browser are you using?
<CTHULHU> damn pig
<djblazekin> google chrome it worked fine yesterday for the live stream of the new ep
<AJIsAwesome> djblazekin: You'd have to use either Firefox or another browser. Chrome isn't exactly compatible with Justin TV.
<Chrysalis> interesting fact: minecarts have different physics settings when they are empty, and when they have something in them
<smallchild1024> chrome fails. firefox ftw :D
<AJIsAwesome> What will you name him, SuperBrony64?
<Chrysalis> firefox fails
<djblazekin> it's saying loading the justin tv player in a frame is not allowed
<Chrysalis> opera ftw
<therainbowvortex> kia ora every pony
<jojoyasmin> ch-ch-ch-chia!
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, therainbowvortex. :)
<Chrysalis> i dont like the crafting for the xbox
<Chrysalis> no grids
<AJIsAwesome> 3 AM? Who eats a Krabby Patty at 3 AM?
<CTHULHU> a brony
<therainbowvortex> me
<jojoyasmin> crafting on xbox requires no memorization
<djblazekin> i'm eating ramen at 3 am just because toonami is on
<jojoyasmin> Makes me kinda sad
*Saturn 08,01shivers
<Saturn> 08,01i'm frozen
<Chrysalis> Ohai Saturn

<jojoyasmin> NO! A pepsi bottle.
<Drew> jiggily puff? or how ever it's spelled :P
<jojoyasmin> My final guess
<aniderp> buneary
<KrazyNoobs> lopunny
<djblazekin> nightmare moon vs voldamort
<aniderp> boldore
<KrazyNoobs> gigalith
<Drew> It could be kirby lol
<KrazyNoobs> roggenrola
<Saturn> 08,01okay, so
<SkunkTauri> i think it is kirby
<jojoyasmin> ...
<KrazyNoobs> Hoshi no Kaabii
<Saturn> 08,01i don't think rainbow dash is a lesbian, contrary to the general consensus of the fandom
<Saturn> 08,01but i do think scootaloo is
<KrazyNoobs> Cleffairy
<KrazyNoobs> is what?
<Saturn> 08,01also, lunaception is awesome
<geeky> hail Luna
<d3rb_> yep
<jojoyasmin> Why is that Saturn?
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn true dat
<SkunkTauri> Rainbow Dash is tomby not Lesbian
<SkunkTauri> *tomboy
<Drew> Scootaloo isn't lesbian o.o
<d3rb_> ^
<KrazyNoobs> <
<SpeccyRush> she's just a fangirl
<Drew> lol
<d3rb_> or stalker
<geeky> Scoots is my fave CMC
<jojoyasmin> I think we all agree, we'd love the ponies no matter their preference
<Saturn> 08,01well, in my mind, i can totally not see her enjoying being with a stallion
<KrazyNoobs> Scootaloo is a lesbian?
<jojoyasmin> Or would we?
<Saturn> 08,01when grown up, tha tis
<SpeccyRush> d3rb_: there's a differance :S
<geeky> d3rb_: no difrence
<d3rb_> lol
<Drew> yeah...
<d3rb_> ok you 2 fight it out, winner is right
<Drew> I don't think they'll ever grow up though XD
<KrazyNoobs> If Scootaloo and Rainbow Dash are lesbians, then... the makers wouldn't allow that to be the case, so at least I know it isn't true.
<jojoyasmin> LOL
<SkunkTauri> ponies live a very long time
<Saturn> 08,01also, is it just me, or has applebloom's voice become really weird recently?
<jojoyasmin> ^
<Drew> Didn't notice :P
<SpeccyRush> puberty Saturn
<d3rb_> VA is probably just gettin older
<jojoyasmin> Ah puberty. Gets the best of em...
<KrazyNoobs> bye BS
<Drew> too bad :(
<jojoyasmin> Also, dat twilight
<geeky> by KrazyNoobs
<d3rb_> later KrazyNoobs
<djblazekin> twilight sparkle with alicorn amulette vs 7th year harry potter who'd win the magic duel
<d3rb_> indeed, dat twi
<jojoyasmin> ...
<Drew> twi would distroy everything :I
<jojoyasmin> I don't care for Harry Potter over all... so I dunno
<Saturn> 08,01twilight sparkle with alicorn amulette = god tier
<SkunkTauri> twilight has lost control over her power when she did the magic exam
<SkunkTauri> when she was a filly
<djblazekin> i forgot harry with voldamorts wand
<Drew> naw...
<Drew> weak
<Saturn> 08,01harry potter: wands akimbo
<jojoyasmin> That rainboom must have scared the crap out of her to make her powers go all crazy
<Saturn> 08,01but no, i think twi would win
<Saturn> 08,01because honestly, harry is a pretty average wizard
<Saturn> 08,01not god-tier powerful like twiliht
<Saturn> 08,01only his mother's sacrifice protected him
<SkunkTauri> jojoyasmin: The sonic Rainboom caused a domino affect down the line
<Saturn> 08,01there's nothign really all that special about him
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> the scar....
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> um
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> yea
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> :I
<Saturn> 08,01also, have some scootaloo: http://du.cx/2rC
<djblazekin> he did defeate the most powerfull dark wizard
<jojoyasmin> SkunkTauri: This I know, but still. "Oh man I'm going to fail this exa--OH SHI" *crazy magic*
<Saturn> 08,01djblazekin: through a fluke
<jojoyasmin> Basically what I think happened
<SkunkTauri> jojoyasmin: XD
*Saturn 08,01can't actually remember how he defeated him
<Saturn> 08,01magic of friendship or some shit
<SkunkTauri> Saturn: The killing curse rebounded on him
<jojoyasmin> o_____O Twilight?
<jojoyasmin> You okay?
<djblazekin> nah cuz that would have required five others
<SkunkTauri> theres a seventh element now, The power of love
<djblazekin> hermione, ron, ginny, hagrid, and snape
<Drew> Pinky Pie can bends reality :I
<Drew> grammar fail ^
<djblazekin> but harry beat vuldamort one on one
<SkunkTauri> the elements of harmony + the power of love= ownage
<djblazekin> where as twilight had the other five join her to defeat discord, nightmare moon and crystalys
<Saturn> 08,01wait, wasn't it neville who eventually kills voldemort?
<Saturn> 08,01or am i remembering it wrongly?
<jojoyasmin> Man. I haven't drawn any new art lately...
<Invi> djblazekin, but he has hands and wizard technology
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> neville was voldemort
<sub06905|DBZ_Budokai> :I
<SkunkTauri> Shining Armor and Cadence defeated Chrysalis
<djblazekin> harry kills him off
<SpeccyRush> Saturn: neville kills the snake
<SpeccyRush> which was the last horcrux
<d3rb_> jojoyasmin, stop talkin & start drawin :P
<Drew> What's up with the Ponies with wings and unicorns? sorry im new :I
<jojoyasmin> d3rb , I would if I wasn't ina lazy mood XD Otherwise I'd be working on my OCs
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This one is much harder than I expected...
<d3rb_> drew, alicorns
<Drew> oh :o
<SkunkTauri> i wonder if they are going to add anymore alicorns
<Moopy> opa gangnam style
<d3rb_> i hope not
<djblazekin> i was confused once about the allicorn thing too
<d3rb_> too many means they're not special
<jojoyasmin> ^
<Drew> There are 4 right?
<djblazekin> will there be a male alicorn
<SkunkTauri> Princess Celestia, luna and cadence is enough already
<Drew> What about the evil one?
<d3rb_> a male black and red alicorn as fanservice for all the oc's that look the same
<Drew> oh yeah..
<SkunkTauri> chrysalis is a changeling queen also an alicorn
<jojoyasmin> Humm. There are a lot of red and black OCs
<djblazekin> my oc is a ponyfied version of toonami tom
<jojoyasmin> Luckily, mine aren't ^^
<djblazekin> i also ponyfied cortana and working on master chief
<jojoyasmin> I attempted to ponify a lot of characters. Most of the time thee look iffy
<jojoyasmin> they*
<jojoyasmin> I've* Really?
<d3rb_> i just make one drawing drag out for months on end then not finish it :)
<SkunkTauri> i cant draw at all :C
<Drew> same here :l
<d3rb_> everyone can draw
<jojoyasmin> I try to finifh in one sitting, otherwise there's a chance of not finishing my stuff
<Drew> well*
<jojoyasmin> finish* GAH
<SkunkTauri> i cant even draw a square with straight lines
<SkunkTauri> or a good circle
<Drew> You can if you use Photo shop
<d3rb_> i just tried drawing a 'perfect' square, i failed
<jojoyasmin> Well that's just difficult without a ruler or straight line tools in drawing programs
<d3rb_> hmm, getting close now
<jojoyasmin> But I can't really say anything, especially when I have to draw circles for people XD
<SkunkTauri> im wishing i had very good drawing skills
<d3rb_> just takes time and practice
<d3rb_> like any skill
<jojoyasmin> Yep
<SkunkTauri> i draw like a kindergardner at age 18 which is quite sad :'(
<jojoyasmin> Though I feel awesome about my art, and then I get on Deviantart...
<djblazekin> lady pixle heart is best artist
<jojoyasmin> My mood goes down the tubes when I go to DA
<d3rb_> jojoyasmin, lol i know right
<d3rb_> front page.....fuck this *throws tablet in bin*
<SkunkTauri> i very rarely go on DA
<jojoyasmin> "This is so amazing" *just a plain pony*
<SkunkTauri> i mostly spend time on FA
<jojoyasmin> *gets online and sees amazing samurai pony at sunset*
<jojoyasmin> "...well."
<d3rb_> DA may as well be FA
<jojoyasmin> Basically XD it's all you see
<SkunkTauri> most art on DA is tame
<SkunkTauri> FA, the front page is porn
<SkunkTauri> all red bordered pictures
<djblazekin> fae vallentine ponified would look better than silverspoon and diamand tiara and actually would put them to shame
<jojoyasmin> Oh look at twilight now
<jojoyasmin> Messages on DA: 2,053
<jojoyasmin> ._.
<Drew> what's a da? >.>
<jojoyasmin> Deviantart, an art website

*jojoyasmin only watched Inuyasha once to see why her friends liked it
<jojoyasmin> Didn't see why.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02What do you think Twilight should say relating to Nintendo? o.o

<jojoyasmin> This show, "I just think races should live in their own country"
<jojoyasmin> Wtf?

<jojoyasmin> XD I have no idea why the show is on
<jojoyasmin> Inuyasha really is on...damn.
<djblazekin> yes that fox kid is mischevious
<Spectre> Terrible show
<jojoyasmin> I guess I'll watch with you

<d3rb> yep. thats spot on
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Night Drew :)

<jojoyasmin> What is that giant monster thing groaning at the fox kid on the ground?
<djblazekin> kamehamehaaaaaaaaaaa
<jojoyasmin> Cause he's the one I saw go "BLARRRGH"
<djblazekin> idk but he wants the jewl shard
<Saturn> 08,01oh god, i'd forgotten how much i love the first 3 harry potter books
<Saturn> 08,01but goddamnit, i have shit to do
<jojoyasmin> *random saturn time*
<Spectre> Saturn make a clone I heard that's all the rage lately
<jojoyasmin> Oh ._. fox kid...you got jacked up bro
<djblazekin> they are the thunder bros
<SuperBrony64> 11,02VIDEO GAME TIEM OMG HE'S ACTUALLY PLAYING GAMES NOW

<jojoyasmin> Oh god! GIRL! Get off the ground! There's a male voice!
<jojoyasmin> Oh it's the creepy weird dude
<jojoyasmin> Oh what? Games? Are you sure SB?
*AdamTheDuck licks SuperBrony64 "Who's a silly filly?" :3
<jojoyasmin> ._.
*SuperBrony64 licks AdamTheDuck back 'meh? :oc'
<Spectre> ??
<djblazekin> i sent adult swim a tripple dog dare to show a mlp fim mareathon on april 1st 2013
<jojoyasmin> what just happened?
<d3rb> jojoyasmin, normal bronystate chat
<jojoyasmin> OH what?
<jojoyasmin> XD
<Spectre> Random shit I think just happened?
<KrazyNoobs> djblazekin lol
<jojoyasmin> Also, I would love adult swim even more if they did
*SpeccyRush slaps Jmo around a bit with a large trout
<KrazyNoobs> Adult Swim says that bronies are the 3rd creepiest people in the world, so I don't think that's a possibility. :'(
<Spectre> Example taken
<jojoyasmin> ...asshats
<jojoyasmin> XD Oh man I just imagines an ass hat
<jojoyasmin> imagined*
<Spectre> Wait creepy??
<KrazyNoobs> Spectre yes... behind two types of furries. I hate that
<jojoyasmin> Of course they're probably looking at the creepy bronies
<d3rb> they do stand out
<jojoyasmin> And the non-normal ones that actually do stuff and are normal
<jojoyasmin> ARE IGNORED
<djblazekin> we can only blame the rule 34 bronies
<KrazyNoobs> jojoyasmin To non-bronies, every brony is creepy. They should at least know that there are two types of bronies: cloppers-who-go-to-bronycon and people who enjoy the show
<jojoyasmin> Also, ignore that non...
<d3rb> because the weird ones seem to want everyone to know what they dio
<Spectre> KrazyNoobs that's retarded not all bronies are messed up in the head
<KrazyNoobs> Spectre I never said that... I said most non-bronies think that. people who have never heard of our fandom will assume that we are messed up, while that is very far from reality
<d3rb> to a 'normal' person i can see how they could jump to that conclusion
<jojoyasmin> If bronies were a group of about 100, about 10-15 of them would be the clopper s and the rest, normal
<Chrysalis> huh whats this
<AdamTheDuck> Chrysalis, Sparta?
<Chrysalis> -.-
<d3rb> madness?
<jojoyasmin> Maybe more or less cloppers
<AdamTheDuck> Insanity?
<Spectre> Yeah that's stupid I'm a brony but I'm actually against clopping period so yeah
<KrazyNoobs> jojoyasmin That would mean there are 200,000 cloppers... i cannot get myself to believe that
<jojoyasmin> Pahaha
<AdamTheDuck> Is SB still streaming?
<jojoyasmin> Like I said, more or less :P
<djblazekin> yep blops 2
<Chrysalis> ah its the bit of blops i will never seer
<KrazyNoobs> j
<SpeccyRush> the mp
<KrazyNoobs> jj
<jojoyasmin> But considering the amount of non-cloppers, it's very annoying how people only focus on the cloppers
<KrazyNoobs> jjj
<Chrysalis> jojoyasmin people always focus on the vocal minority
<djblazekin> sweet steve blum is the epic announcer for the marines side
<jojoyasmin> Of course.
<KrazyNoobs> jojoyasmin I know that feel. Tosh.0, I love that show, but Daniel Tosh's job is to insult people, so we cannot say that was not going to come
<jojoyasmin> And that's how stereotypes are born
<jojoyasmin> V_V
<KrazyNoobs> Dayum dats sum guuuuuud cheeyiken
<jojoyasmin> MAde me sad though, man. Very sad...
<jojoyasmin> Also "HEY LOOK! One black guy has chicken and purple koolaid! I bet they all love that!"
<djblazekin> if rarity had the personality of fae vallentine she'd be mor tollerable
<KrazyNoobs> They actually showed MLP:FiM Rule 34 on national television with Tosh.0, and now about 3 million people may think of us as sick to the head.
<jojoyasmin> Well that'
<KrazyNoobs> purple drank
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome to society jojoyasmin.
<jojoyasmin> Hit enter early
<Spectre> KrazyNoobs did Tosh seriously do that??
<d3rb> yep
<jojoyasmin> that's lovely*
<PonyGirl123> 6_9
<KrazyNoobs> Spectre look it up on Youtube, that is, if you can tolerate looking at Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash doing things...
<Spectre> Now I have the sudden urge to beat the shit out of Tosh now
<djblazekin> flutterdash is a cute yuri couple
<jojoyasmin> It's funny, I hardly say anything pony related to my friends and I'm weird and talk about ponies too much. But then they start talking about their TV shows every two seconds.
<jojoyasmin> Pfft
<KrazyNoobs> I saw that once, and it enraged me, and scarred me for about twelve and a half minutes
<Spectre> Who the hell puts up two ponies doing things on national television? Just to scar all of us non cloppers?! Bullshit
<KrazyNoobs> jojoyasmin A boy at my school is 'cool' for watching Gossip Girl, apparently. If you say you like My Little Pony, your going to have a BAD time.
<d3rb> trolling Spectre, to get a reaction from viewers or fans
<djblazekin> it's a back 2 back inuyasha
<KrazyNoobs> What I mean is, boys can watch stupid chick shows without criticism, while a show that is ACTUALLY good will get you laughed at
<jojoyasmin> KrazyNoobs: Well. Bullshit. It's more accepted at my school though as long as you don't talk about it as much as everyone talks about "normal shows"
<PonyGirl123> ABC.com Ages 2-6 WTF??????
<KrazyNoobs> I only mentioned it once when we were talking about fandoms, and they were all like, WTF.
<Spectre> I always did think Tosh was an ass
<KrazyNoobs> PonyGirl123 are you talking about the reviews for MLP:FiN
<jojoyasmin> I suppose it's more acceptable for me though. I'm a girl. It's still weird to them. But my guy friend says one thing, ONE THING, pony related and they look at him worse than me
<PonyGirl123> No Its On Twitch TV On My Computer
<JRP2234> ima musiscabnn
<djblazekin> my cuzin thinks i'm wierd for liking mlp fim and said it's not cool and that strawberry shortcake had better animation

<AdamTheDuck> Go to bread young man
*SuperBrony64 dies
<Spectre> KrazyNoobs that's just......wow I'm a guy and I find that hilarious
<jojoyasmin> Especially in comparison to mlp!
<JRP2234> did you draw mine yet or just keep ignoring me
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: I'll draw it when I can
<KrazyNoobs> jojoyasmin Spectre and guys watch Pretty Little Liars and Gossip Girl. Doctor Who, I can tolerate a bit more.
<jojoyasmin> I feel like punching people...
<djblazekin> doctor whooves and the assistant got me into watching doctor who
<jojoyasmin> But then I'd look obsessed
<jojoyasmin> Or whatever
<KrazyNoobs> djblazekin yay
<Chrysalis> man zelda is as overated as dr who
<jojoyasmin> That one guy: "Actuaaaaally..."
<jojoyasmin> Everytime....
<Vivix> You know what else's overated? Midi
<djblazekin> mutated minty on inuyasha
<d3rb> midi?
<Vivix> yeah~~
<Chrysalis> seriously? midi?
<d3rb> i dont get it...
<jojoyasmin> Dafuq is that guy on Inuyasha?!
<Ghosties> 04Goodnight everyone!
<Vivix> it can be really damn useful, but people rely so much on it-

<Spectre> Another show I can't stand - Inuyasha
<jojoyasmin> ^
<Chrysalis> thanks for streamSB
<jojoyasmin> I'm trying to figure it out right now
*AdamTheDuck stands and salutes for BronyState's anthem

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Thanks for tuning in all :3
<JRP2234> ima tree
<KrazyNoobs> Spectre I think relationships are the main cause for boys watching these: to impress girls. I am yet to see a single female in modern day society between the age of 8 and 16 who doesn't like One Direction. All the girls in my school do, and the boys pretend to love One Direction now. Everything about mainstream society these days is f---ed up.
<JRP2234> wait
<jojoyasmin> Dragon Ball Z is always better
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 isent it happening?
<d3rb> thnaks for stream SuperBrony64
<AdamTheDuck> KrazyNoobs, oh I know a few...
<d3rb> thanks** derp
<Chrysalis> cept gangnam style
<PoohBear> brb
<Chrysalis> that stuffs just cool
<Chrysalis> and better than biber
<Vivix> Gangnam is a song I was never able to listen through
<d3rb> KrazyNoobs, wait....guys liking one direction.....
<jojoyasmin> I hate one direction... I was at the poster section of a store and these two girls ran up squealing at the posters
<d3rb> LAWL
<djblazekin> my gf hates twilight saga and one direction she is 13 i'm 14
<Ryunosuke> !
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64
<Ryunosuke> I just had a realization
<JRP2234> its happening SuperBrony64
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Refresh embed everypony~
<KrazyNoobs> Yup, d3rb. Just to impress girls. Stupid, huh?
<d3rb> lol, morons
<Chrysalis> suddenly fire
<Ryunosuke> the last episode "Sleepless in Ponyville" was a Scootaloo episode, about her... being a chicken
<Spectre> KrazyNoobs that just tells you right there how desperate guys can get so glad I'm not like that at all if I'm going to impress a girl I'm going to do something other then watch those retarded shows
<Vivix> Not just to impress
<jojoyasmin> Friggin squealing girls running through stores, looking at 1D...makes us all look bad
<Vivix> People like things because they like it
<d3rb> i mean if they actually like them fine (they have terrible taste but fine)
<Moopy> Yay the fire place
<KrazyNoobs> Spectre I'm asexual (no sexuality), so I am very confused by all of this, but I am glad that I am not a slave to sex.
<Vivix> I'm very sexual, and I am not a slave to sex
<djblazekin> my gf hates american pop music but loves vocaloid and mlp fim
<KrazyNoobs> teh fire
<jojoyasmin> And she's awesome
<Vivix> asexuality is a very, very, rare function, extremely few people have it, but tons of people think they have it
<Spectre> KrazyNoobs trust me man I'm 100% straight and I even find that rediculous
<KrazyNoobs> djblazekin You sure she's a girl? Faith in humanity has been restored
<jojoyasmin> Well vocaloid...meh
<djblazekin> that and anime hates american tv
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 your forgetting somthing
<d3rb> marshmallows?
<djblazekin> yesh she is
<jojoyasmin> Pass me the marshmallows please!
*Chrysalis passes jojoyasmin a rarity
<jojoyasmin> ...that works too
*d3rb *noms all the raritys*
<jojoyasmin> ._.
<djblazekin> and she is a brony/pegasister whatever you prefer
<jojoyasmin> I'll just talk...to her...I guess...
<Ryunosuke> huh
<Chrysalis> i never did like the whole pegasister thing
<Ryunosuke> apparently Lucky Star is getting a new season
<jojoyasmin> WHAT
<KrazyNoobs> Spectre: Awesome, I have watched as the kids I grew up with have become disgusting pieces of crap, always making jokes about sex and 'how much they love it'. Because I don't have sex in my life, I have actually done stuff, I have been put into an extension program that my school runs, and am already half-way through a Marine Biology degree at an age of 17, I'm still in Year 12
<jojoyasmin> WHAT?!
<Chrysalis> kinda removes the point of it being a fandom for the show
<Chrysalis> and seperates people
<jojoyasmin> LUCKY STAR?!
<jojoyasmin> Ahem...I mean, cool/
<jojoyasmin> That's nice.
<djblazekin> glad jersey shore is ending now if only mtv went off the air entirely
<Ryunosuke> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2102502/
<Ryunosuke> oops
<KrazyNoobs> djblazekin: honey boo boo child. T_T
<Ryunosuke> wrong one
<Chrysalis> in4 massive spam to tf2
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: What am I forgetting?
<Vivix> Mmm- you shouldn't judge people based on their sexuality, especially in the hormonal age
*Gold_Demona sits by the fire.
<Gold_Demona> Good morning Bronystate. :>
<jojoyasmin> WHAT? Inuyasha is showing a family of those weird things?
<djblazekin> crackers and choclate
<JRP2234> SuperBrony64 your forgetiing that its happening now
*SuperBrony64 curls up by the fire -u-
*KrazyNoobs sits in the fire
<Spectre> KrazyNoobs nice, yeah I just find it retarded "What's that you want to go watch Gossip Girl because you think all the girls will like you then? F*** you I'm just going to go play some Silent Hill I mean damn"
<SuperBrony64> 11,02JRP2234: Played it already :(
<Gold_Demona> :>
<JRP2234> dang it
<Vivix> Spectre I think you got the wrong impression, not many people bother enjoying thigns just for the sake of attention
<Saturn> 08,01so NASA are working on implementing a "warp field interferometer"
<Spectre> Vivix you'd be suprised
<jojoyasmin> Humm?
<Chrysalis> Saturn citation
<Vivix> they might say they enjoy something for sake of attention, but actually go through with it?
<Vivix> No, I doubt I'd be surprised, there's going to be some, but few
<Gold_Demona> Chat is busy this morning, nobody even noticed me come in. :D

<Vivix> I've seen it too, but it usually does not last, and it almost never works, most people who enjoy something like- a guy liking One direction, genuinly appreciates it
<djblazekin> i legitly hate jersey shore and the live action stuff on cn and adult swim
<Phase4> 00,02JRP2234, NO :<
<JRP2234> dat NO
*KrazyNoobs sides have been lost
<Spectre> I suppose that's true all I'm saying is guys shouldn't like girl shows just to get their attention
<Saturn> 08,01it sounds cool, and, well, it is
<KrazyNoobs> brb
<Saturn> 08,01but it's a device for measuring the disturbance of spacetime
<Vivix> no, I agree with that, but guys will like girly things, and girls will like guy-ish things, without it being-- you know, fake
<Spectre> Well see if it's not fake then I don't have a problem with it
<Vivix> ahkai, good good

<jojoyasmin> Also: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Knui9UN679w&feature=g-hist
<jojoyasmin> Just because I'm being lead by side videos
<Spectre> Djblazekin well yeah there's alot of tomboys out there
<d3rb> i have no idea what that thing is Saturn but it sounds very important and cool
<Vivix> most girls I've known have been nerds and tomboys
<d3rb> i am but a mere idiot
<Saturn> 08,01they want to "creat conditions similar to what drives the expansion of the cosmos"
<Vivix> first girl I befriended played doom
<Saturn> 08,01yayphysics! \o/
<Spectre> Hey Doom is an epic game
<d3rb> okay now im probably going into the deep end here and onto a topic people hate buuut....
*Saturn 08,01likes Desperate Housewives and Charmed unironically
<Vivix> it was, yeah
<Spectre> Saturn I'm not going to lie I actually liked Charmed aswell
<Saturn> 08,01also, don't think any less of me, but... i like My Little Pony...
<Alchemist> oh its so nice to gather round the warm furnace :)
<d3rb> when i see something like what Saturn has just shown i cant help but wonder why people dont question things more such a religion
*Spectre was a big Cole fan
<Vivix> I loved Gilmour Girls
<Alchemist> or whatever its called in english :D
<wipergone2> SuperBrony64: \:3/
<Saturn> 08,01Spectre: Cole was awesome and really hot!
<Saturn> 08,01but Leo was hotter
<Vivix> Leo?
<Vivix> Wasn't he really plain?
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: plain?! buff, more like
<wipergone2> Saturn: \:3/
<Vivix> aahh
<Saturn> 08,01with a wonderful smile
<Vivix> Long time since I've seen charmed-
<Vivix> never followed it
<Spectre> Saturn since I'm a guy I say Phoebe was a babe totally lol
<djblazekin> i liked hi hi puffy amiyumi a cartton aimed for girls and my parents didnt complain i watched and enjoyed sailor moon another show aimed tward girls but when my mom walked in and saw me watching mlp fim she asked if i was gay
<Saturn> 08,01d3rb: it's odd, here in the uk, there's not so much religious fanaticism
<Vivix> What was that young guy in in Gilmour Girls?-- the rebel
<Spectre> Although odd to say my favorite from Charmed was always Darrell
<Vordoxensaurus> djblazekin: XD
<Saturn> 08,01certainly not so much of a religious culture as the US
<Vivix> I've never met a fanatic christian
<Vivix> or well, once, there were 3 religious girls in my shcool
<d3rb> yeah, im lucky to be in australia...by comparison to us in that regard at least
<Vivix> then again, I respect and love religion
<Saturn> 08,01which means that when i see the US "atheist movement" i feel a great swell of pride, like a mother watching her child take its first steps
<d3rb> ^
<Saturn> 08,01except in this case, it's truth instead of walking
<Vivix> Most atheists I've met are more intrusive and aggressive than Jehovas
<Chrysalis> Saturn they only recently got a 50% atheist switch in the US
<Chrysalis> a little late
<Vivix> so I don't really want to be associated with them
<Saturn> 08,01Chrysalis: i'm so proud of them, still
<Chrysalis> but at least more americans are realising their own mistakes
<Spectre> Vivix well then you just met him I'm actually a big time Christian
<Saturn> 08,01they're becomeing civilised
<pony_3045> winter is coming :S
<Chrysalis> cause even if there were a god
<Saturn> 08,01finally
<Chrysalis> he would be such a prick
<Vivix> I met who?
<XAX> New pone was great last night.
<Spectre> You said you never met a major Christian?
<Vivix> Oh, yes
<Chrysalis> Isnt it still under spoilers
<Vivix> Hi
<Chrysalis> less than 24 hours
<Spectre> Lol hello Vivix
<Saturn> 08,01now don't get me wrong; i have no hate of people because of their religion. you don't hate someone just because they're wrong.
<Vivix> There was one girl in our school that was a major christian, but I never really talked to her, she was kind of strange
<d3rb> people are free to believe what they want
<Alchemist> We arent getting into a religion vs atheism debate are we?
<XAX> Chrysalis: ;_; yes.
<pony_3045> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95_1fPf2dhs
<d3rb> as long as they dont force it upon others
<Vivix> that goes for all of us, yeah
<XAX> Doctor Who is best religion.
<Vivix> we who don't believe, should not force others to not
<djblazekin> is it just me or do lps and mlp have some of the same vas
<Vivix> they do
<AdamTheDuck> Yes yes yes!
*KrazyNoobs comes back shocked to see people fighting over religion
<AdamTheDuck> Fireplace hour on BronyState!
<Spectre> Alchemist I freaking hope not I can't stand getting into religious fights
<Phase4> 00,02"White-Juday Warp Field Interferometer" whoever came up with this name was a star trek fan, i sware
<Vivix> KrazyNoobs, you must be imagining the fighting part
<d3rb> this is far from a fight
<d3rb> this is very civilized
<Saturn> 08,01i'm actually thinking of making a brony mockumentary that takes the piss and makes us out to be a religious cult
<Alchemist> Spectre: me neither, thats why I keep my position to myself.
<Vivix> Celestia worshipping freaks?
<Phase4> 00,02Saturn, that could be fun
<XAX> Saturn: Do it. Would be awesomazing.
<d3rb> "thay worship this god called....mollestia"
<AdamTheDuck> Vivix, :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcrJHO_FxCU
<AdamTheDuck> d3rb, XD
<Alchemist> Spectre: most of the times simply stating ones position is enough to create a shitstorm
<XAX> d3rb: Nah. Celestia is god. Molestia can be like...
<XAX> iunno
<Saturn> 08,01i want to do it in a "like it's playing it straight" Spinal Tap style
<Vivix> Chris Jarvis?Hm
<pony_3045> http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/29100000/scootaloo-and-rainbow-dash-rainbowdash-29126204-1280-800.png and now this is canon
<XAX> something
<d3rb> mollestia is satan
<XAX> nah
<XAX> NMM
<KrazyNoobs> Instead of fighting over religion, let's fight over Slenderman. I think Slenderman is not real, I will now allow the opposition to rebut.
<djblazekin> is the fox kid demon a female or male
<Saturn> 08,01so just have it compeltely ridiculous, but almost believable
<d3rb> but he is real. i win
<sub06905> wait.... so we're not a cult?
<Vivix> we are now
<d3rb> should i serve the kool aid now?
<Vivix> start filming Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01like, altars to Luna and stuff
<Alchemist> what is the definition of a cult anyways?
<Spectre> Alchemist I can agree on that one I mean I actually tend to get really offended easily but I don't feel like going through another religious shitty fight
<Saturn> 08,01Vivix: i'm gonna write up a script in the spring; hopefully start filming in the summer
<KrazyNoobs> Slenderman is not real because it was made up by some ancient people around 1600, as a story
<Vivix> That would be cool, especially the strange style of Spinal Tap
<Vivix> SlenderMan was made up on the itnernet in 2007 ish
<d3rb> but this goes to 11
<Chrysalis> america
<djblazekin> some of those bible thumpers are the same parasprite soccermoms who complained about derpy
<Chrysalis> where the scariest thing they know
<Chrysalis> is called slender man
<Vivix> I'm more scared of "That drunk guy with a hammer"
<KrazyNoobs> Vivix See? There are so many stories about how religions started, and there are so many religions, thus there are many sides to the argument. That is why I despise argue over religion.
<Saturn> 08,01though i only want to start writing once i've seen the final release version of brockhoff's BRONIES documentary
<KrazyNoobs> I was using Slenderman as a metaphor
<Alchemist> I think I know where I've seen this youtube vid. It was a video of a dramatic reading of a sonic clopfic :D
<Vivix> Akai~~?
<Saturn> 08,01because... well, it's gonna lampoon it a bit
<Vivix> but noone was arguing- and the conversation moved on
<KrazyNoobs> Religions carry interesting stories, just like the story of Slenderman, but it is nothing to argue over.
<pony_3045> http://rainbowdash.net/file/rainbowdashsboyfriend-20120412T230439-zsahcsw.png
<KrazyNoobs> Also, I got 8 notes. :D
<d3rb> actually......no resist! must resist urge to argue
<Vivix> I never played it
<pony_3045> just love this picture
<KrazyNoobs> pony_3045 403 forbidden
<d3rb> dawwwwww
<AdamTheDuck> KrazyNoobs, works for me
<Saturn> 08,01that pic is a load of crap; no-one sleeps smiling, it's biologically impossible
<Alchemist> 403 for me too
<Vivix> they're resting their eeyes
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, oh you :$
<Saturn> 08,01unless they're not quite asleep
<Vivix> ^
<pony_3045> for me it's ok hmm
<Chrysalis> Saturn they could be just dozing
<Vivix> ponies are cute when they're sleeping- all blankfaced
<Alchemist> or if they are the Joker.
<KrazyNoobs> I am a pastafarian
<pony_3045> http://imgur.com/FjFOU
<KrazyNoobs> pony_3045 diabeetus achieved
<Alchemist> KrazyNoobs: you smoke spaghetti and sleep all day?
<Saturn> 08,01anyhoos, time for some bacon
<djblazekin> toonami is over off to bed see yall l8r space ponies
<Saturn> 08,01catch y'all later!
<d3rb> take it easy djblazekin
<AdamTheDuck> Bye Saturn :P
<d3rb> cya Saturn
<AdamTheDuck> Bye djblazekin
<KrazyNoobs> Yes, and if you follow the 1 commandment set by the flying spaghetti monster, you go to heaven, with stripper factories and chocolate fountains. :)
<d3rb> fuck yeah, brb converting
<KrazyNoobs> lol
<Vivix> Strippers? No, clothes are sexier
<KrazyNoobs> Vivix NO CLOTHES IS A SIN
<Vivix> Screw sin! I want clothes!
<KrazyNoobs> YOU WILL NOW BE STONED TO DEATH
<KrazyNoobs> with spaghetti
<Vivix> yaay~~?
*AdamTheDuck noms on the spaghetti .-.
<d3rb> striping implies clothes to start with
<Vivix> I love fashion-
<Moopy> Well i'd better get some sleep so a night everypony
<KrazyNoobs> Goodnight Moopy
<Vivix> so, honestly, beautiful clothes > stripping
<TrixieMuffin> may his noodly apendage touch you
<AdamTheDuck> Goodnight Moopy :P
<Alchemist> d3rb unless its the grimdark/bizarre type of stripping
<d3rb> D:
<Vivix> poor Pony--
<KrazyNoobs> In Australia, only the old folks believe in religion. I never knew that religion existed until 8th grade.
<d3rb> :D wow really
<AdamTheDuck> KrazyNoobs, .-.
<AdamTheDuck> Lies.
<Vivix> I had great grades in religious studies
<Vivix> but I had no idea people believed in it-
<KrazyNoobs> Vivix same
<KrazyNoobs> Vivix I was shocked to hear that modern day people in mainstream society believed in supernaturability.
<Saturn> 08,01religion is the cancer that's killing /b/
<Saturn> 08,01er
<Saturn> 08,01, i mean
<Saturn> 08,01bacon.
<Vivix> Well, I was never shocked by it once I learned it
<Gold_Demona> Mmm bacon
<AdamTheDuck> No not the bacon D:
<KrazyNoobs> f
*Saturn 08,01scootaloos off
<Vivix> I've never believed myself ot be smarter or better than a group of people
*KrazyNoobs goes to /mlp/
*KrazyNoobs comes back crying
<d3rb> wow, you lasted a whole 2 seconds, good effort
*AdamTheDuck places a cookie on KrazyNoobs' head
*KrazyNoobs eats it
<Vivix> In fact, a few years a go I wanted to be religious, just to see what it felt like, but once you don't believe, believing was almost impossible
<AdamTheDuck> ^
*Vivix huggles Adam, the meat eating duck
<Vivix> now brb, darlings! Food-time
*AdamTheDuck licks Vivix :P
<Gold_Demona> Yeah, belief isn't something you just force into being. It has to just simply happen. =/
<Vivix> mrreep
<Vivix> yeah~~
*Vivix runs
*AdamTheDuck boops Gold_Demona's nose :3
<Gold_Demona> Dat's mah nose!~ :D
<KrazyNoobs> Vivix: I watched this poll on the internet about this man asking people at a religious charity organization questions about what science aspects they believed in. 2% believed in the big bang, 49% in evolution, etc. etc. Everyone believed different things, thus there are thousands of different Christianities. INteresting, huh?
<Vivix> yeah, you can believe god created the big bang-
<AdamTheDuck> This fireplace needs some music to go with it
<Vivix> a lot of great scientists and great sciences were from the church
<Vivix> now, really, brb :3
<AdamTheDuck> Maybe this goes well :3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS9SUmAyKWM
<d3rb> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nevnq7MvVTI i see your music and rasie ya
<KrazyNoobs> Vivix yeah, like Gallileo. He was cooked on a rotisary by the church for discovering aspects of space.
<KrazyNoobs> I just looked it up, and found out that he was asked to stop, and he stopped, and was not executed. Sorry.
*AdamTheDuck sighs
<KrazyNoobs> I should have FACTS before I say something.
<Gold_Demona> lol
<AdamTheDuck> Relgion talk on BronyState always makes me depressed for some reason
<d3rb> at least you admit youer mistake and learnt
<Alchemist> Are we really doing this guys? You do know these things usually dont end well...
<Gold_Demona> Me too AdamTheDuck
<KrazyNoobs> Yeah, let's stop. This is stupid
<Gold_Demona> How about them ponies, huh? :D
<Spectre> Yes it is it's very irriting especially since I'm probably the only Christian here
<d3rb> i have a point to make but it will only fuel the fire :<
<KrazyNoobs> If it is just a bunch of athiests talking, there will be no bad ending, just us talking about stuff.
<AdamTheDuck> Gold_Demona, eww ponies >_>
<Alchemist> too bad we still have about 4 hours till we can talk about yesterday's episode.
<AdamTheDuck> Colourful adoescent equine are so homosexual <_<
<KrazyNoobs> Before we continue, are there any religious folk here today?
<AdamTheDuck> adolescent*
<KrazyNoobs> Just want to apologise
<AdamTheDuck> KrazyNoobs, to a degree.
<KrazyNoobs> i love that fire
*d3rb hugs Spectre
<KrazyNoobs> AdamTheDuck which religion?
<Spectre> KrazyNoobs I'm the only Christian here
<Gold_Demona> I have a very mild religious belief, but nothing solid.
<AdamTheDuck> Catholocism.
<KrazyNoobs> Cool, it is good to have a mix of people today.
<Gold_Demona> I believe there is a God, but that's about the extent of my religious belief.
<AdamTheDuck> Catholicism*
<AdamTheDuck> Pfft, I've dragged too far away from my faith
<AdamTheDuck> I just question it for time to time.
<Saturn> 08,01i believe that i would quite like a bacon butty right about now
<AdamTheDuck> from*
<Gold_Demona> I was raised Catholic and my husband is Christian, but I'm not really either.
<KrazyNoobs> I am a non-believer, meaning I only believe in physical entities.
*Spectre hugs d3rb back
<Saturn> 08,01and lo', the frying pan, it doth provide.
<AdamTheDuck> Didn't we agree to deviate away from this discussion earlier? .-.
<d3rb> all hail the frying pan
<Gold_Demona> KrazyNoobs: You mean you don't believe in dreams? D:
<alexxm> hey guys
<AdamTheDuck> Gyrobowl is our only god here.
<AdamTheDuck> Ohai alexxm
<KrazyNoobs> Dreams are created by the mind, Gold_Demona, just like thoughts.
<d3rb> AdamTheDuck, it only takes one comment and its on again
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: aren't you offending your own religious beliefs by saying that?
<alexxm> how've you been AdamTheDuck
<d3rb> hey alexxm
<alexxm> sup d3rb
<KrazyNoobs> Saturn LOL
<Saturn> 08,01i thought "no god but me" and "no brazen idols" were in your scripture
<Saturn> 08,01:P
<KrazyNoobs> I believe in dolan.
<Alchemist> I cant hold it in, sorry: I am so looking forward to the BGM version of the last episode :3 That is all.
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, "Pfft, I've dragged too far away from my faith"
<Spectre> ..........I thought we were done talking about this shit?
<KrazyNoobs> gooby pls is my religion
<Saturn> 08,01"not even for a joke, you bastard"
<Gold_Demona> Spectre: ikr? :P

<Saturn> 08,01i'm sure that's somewhere in the commandments
<KrazyNoobs> d3rb Hail, G-K, and it's trumphiant return to The Hub in 12 days from now
<d3rb_> that kick was worth it
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm, oh I've been fine, although I'm starting to get a little depressed from all this talk.
<Phase4> 00,02"thou shalt not worship the gyrobowl"
<Gold_Demona> Smooze is the only God I need.

<KrazyNoobs> I am athiest, I only believe what is real.
<AdamTheDuck> alexxm, relgion talk.
<pony_3045> "1) play this video 2) search ''Sad Violin'' first video on you tube 3) search ''Rainy Mood'' first﻿ video on you tubeplay all together and﻿ switch this video to full screen Enjoy ur sleep" lol
<d3rb_> yeah smooze i can really get behind that idea
<Alchemist> http://derpy.me/68qHD
<KrazyNoobs> pony_3045 lol
<Spectre> Saturn was that seriously toward me?
<d3rb_> Alchemist, :D irl lols
<pony_3045> i did it
<Saturn> 08,01Spectre: no, i was talking to AdamTheDuck
<AdamTheDuck> This is quite nice http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM3g2SXSa14
<JRP2234> go home Phase4 your frunk
<Spectre> Alright
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, yes the first commandment has something to do with having no other god than God himself.
<Saturn> 08,01Spectre: do you have a favourite bible passage?
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, too bad I don't take my faith as seriously anymore.
<Spectre> Saturn do you mean favorite book of the bible?
<pony_3045> http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/03/scootaloo-is-not-rainbow-dashs-sister.html
<pony_3045> lol
<pony_3045> in 2011
<pony_3045> what you can say now?
<pony_3045> eqd
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, are you still busy?
<KrazyNoobs> I don't believe in religion, I just believe in science and reality. I can respect religion-believers, as they do nothing harmful.
<Saturn> 08,01Spectre: no, favourite verse
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: not so much
<d3rb_> Rainbow is just a role model pony_3045
<KrazyNoobs> brb, feeding my fish
<Spectre> Saturn then no I can't say I do I liked most of them
<Saturn> 08,01fair enough
<d3rb_> KrazyNoobs, err i disagree with the last opart of your statement
<Saturn> 08,01i have a favourite bible verse
<Alchemist> d3rb_: I thought that was obvious. that they are not related.
<Saturn> 08,01but i don't think you'd like it
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, mind if you put that article that you wrote on kids learning more with gaming aspects up?
<KrazyNoobs> d3rb_ 9/11
<Spectre> Even though I never read the old testament all the way through
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, hmm, which verse?
<d3rb_> if that was all it was respoinsible for i would be more ok with it
<Saturn> 08,01AdamTheDuck: Ezekial 23:20
<KrazyNoobs> But only very few Muslims want to kill any western devils.
<KrazyNoobs> lol
<alexxm> eh i haven't actually read the bible
<AdamTheDuck> Saturn, oh you :$
<Alchemist> Saturn: if you mean the pulp fiction reference I think it 25:17
<d3rb_> isn't it 25:17?
<AdamTheDuck> Alchemist, oh no, I think that one is right :$
<d3rb_> yeah
<Saturn> 08,01Spectre: i read Genesis, and as a big sci-fi fan, it made most sense to me when i read it as if it was speculatively talking about an advanced alien race
<KrazyNoobs> I read it to see what the hype was about, I read verse 1 Chapter 1 in Genesis: God said let there be light, and there was light. I laughed
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: no, not that
<KrazyNoobs> and put the book down
<KrazyNoobs> Who here likes religious paradoxes?
<Alchemist> Okay I read that...
<KrazyNoobs> They are fascinating
<AdamTheDuck> I think that's enough Bible bashing KrazyNoobs.
<d3rb_> i like nonstampcollector
<Saturn> 08,01but i do have a favourite book of the bible, in all seriousness
<KrazyNoobs> AdamTheDuck I am not being rude to Christians.
<Saturn> 08,01song of songs is beautiful
<Saturn> 08,01if you want to read somethign wonderful, read that
<AdamTheDuck> Hmm Saturn being serious, this doesn't add up :$
<Spectre> KrazyNoobs I'd hope not
<d3rb_> you are boarderline runde imo KrazyNoobs , unintentional maybe but still
<KrazyNoobs> I am RUDE!?
<KrazyNoobs> nonononno
<KrazyNoobs> no
<KrazyNoobs> NO
<Saturn> 08,01KrazyNoobs: enhance your calm, please.
<KrazyNoobs> I am not being rude, if you want me to stop discussing religion, I shall.
<Saturn> 08,01KrazyNoobs: in all fairness, you were being rude
<KrazyNoobs> Oh, sorry
<Alchemist> KrazyNoobs: we did, many times.
<AdamTheDuck> Let us just all stop, please.
<Spectre> Yes please before I get more offened thanks
<d3rb_> sorry KrazyNoobs
<d3rb_> chat working?
<AdamTheDuck> Yeah, just silent now.
<Alchemist> lets discuss this instead http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUv-Q6EgEF
<KrazyNoobs> Sorry, I just don't understand religious people, I didn't know the borderline on what was rude and what was not. I thought what I was saying was okay, but if it is offensive, I learned something from relisious people. Thanks! and bye, I don't want to witness the flamewar.
<KrazyNoobs> And I apologise sincerely
<d3rb_> Alchemist, dead link
<KrazyNoobs> Bye everypony
<AdamTheDuck> Bye KrazyNoobs.

<alexxm> my favorite book is watchmen
<SuperBrony64> 11,02No :<
<SuperBrony64> 11,02If people read The Magician's Nephew, they would understand so much more about the Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.
<AdamTheDuck> Lord of the Flies is my favourite novel :3
<AdamTheDuck> Welcome back KrazyNoobs.

<SuperBrony64> 11,02Saturn: I think they should make a movie based off of it.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Though they might do it as a 'Find out now how Narnia began~"
<KrazyNoobs> I learned this by talking to them. They have facebook page, and I have been chatting with them for these past 2 days.
<alexxm> KrazyNoobs really what was their reaction
<Saturn> 08,01SuperBrony64: i don't; in today's climate of filmmaking, holywood would make what is essentially a fairly subdued, but interesting, plot into an epic battle of good vs evil
<Saturn> 08,01with bruce willis
<Saturn> 08,01and jet li
<Vivix> and a love interest

<KrazyNoobs> If someone says the magic word, I do it. That word is YOLO, but here, it is okay to say it, I don't want to mess up this place. It is pretty tidy, and I love it that way.
<KrazyNoobs> I only do that on other IRC chats
<Vivix> Don't do it to any chats
<AdamTheDuck> You obviously love Octavia?
<Vivix> it's an asshole thing to do
<KrazyNoobs> Vivix Why?
<Vivix> Respect the choices and lives of others

<MaxTheBrony> night guys.
<SafariMonkey> I generally lurk in bronystate when I'm on my phone though, as I can't easily see stream and chat, and I can't keep up on my phone keyboard. Hope that explains, Socks. And hi Everlasting_Joy and scout19_tf2
<Socks> It'd be so awesome!
<coinflip2> I frickin love Rarity's Princess Platinum outfit

<Cypresswolf> Audible Gasp
<sonicdude558> Rex_Mundi, I do not own a fursuit. But I wish I did
<Socks> SATIRE!
<scout19_tf2> PEGISI PEGISI PEGISI
<AJIsAwesome> I really like Spike's theater voice. It's nice. :)
<CosmicLatte> DAT SCENE CHANGE
<CosmicLatte> Jeeeeez
<CosmicLatte> These are craaaazy scene changes here. That's impossible..
<Rex_Mundi> sonicdude558: I understand
<MLP_Brovakiin> Okies, I am off to bed now, goodnight everyone :)
<Socks> All the unicorns do is day and night? Lazy sods!
<DoctoDoctorWho> I look at those earth ponies and all I hear is "Monty python, MONTY PYTHON!"
<DerpyMuffins> You guys ever wonder where Alicorns come from?
<scout19_tf2> this is wut celestia calls "the great depression"
<alexxm|colt> bye MLP_Brovakiin
<spypengen> Dr. Whooves is the reason for the blizzard.
<Everlasting_Joy> Night night MLP_Brovakiin!
<hufflesong> I love this episode!
<CosmicLatte> They need some Ood..
*Socks huggles MLP_Brovakiin "Bye bye"
<Kandarihu> scout19_tf2, this came before Discord came before Celestia
<CosmicLatte> Bye, Brova :)
<spypengen> they need ga-
<AJIsAwesome> Bye, MLP_Brovakiin. :)
*MLP_Brovakiin hugs everyone :)
*spypengen gets shot
<CosmicLatte> NO, SPY.
<scout19_tf2> nite MLP_Brovakiin :)
<Cypresswolf> seems the unicorns could easily take advantage of the other 2 tribes - if they can move the sun and move, they can take charge of the weather
<DerpyMuffins> Bye MLP_Brovakiin
*CosmicLatte puts away gun
<ZZZ> Spike is the narrator(insert spike emote here)
<thelonepony> Bye MLP_Brovakiin :)
<Cypresswolf> *sun & moon
<alexxm|colt> rabble rabble rabble
<AJIsAwesome> :D
<sonicdude558> dem names
<CosmicLatte> Ahh, StarKid..
<Socks> Oh pinkie :D
<Kandarihu> DerpyMuffins, and yet if the Alicorns have the magic of the unicorns and the flight of the pegasi, surely they should have the strength of the earth ponies.
<scout19_tf2> GOVERNMENT!!!!!!!!!:[
<spypengen> and Pinkie is seceretly plotting to kill everyone.
<ZZZ> chancler puddinghead
<CosmicLatte> Pegasusususususes
<Cypresswolf> Ponies are starving, put pudding on head :D
<Socks> SATIRE!
<SafariMonkey> Cypresswolf: I thought only alicorns could...
<pony85086> Kandarihu: maybe alicorns arent as good at magic and flying as unicorns and pegasi
<jcelios> freaky magic!
<ZZZ> weather speel
<CosmicLatte> Except they clearly are as good.
<sonicdude558> dat crown
<CosmicLatte> Well, I don't think they're quite as FAST as some other pegasi
<Rex_Mundi> I have to admit, I have a huge crush on ponies. Im in love
<AJIsAwesome> Youtube comments in a nutshell?
<sonicdude558> windigoes
<Socks> The crown looks better that way round
<Everlasting_Joy> AJIsAwesome: You beat me to it.
<djxana> do we ever show any g2 or g3
<AJIsAwesome> Everlasting_Joy: You were going to say that? :D
<Cypresswolf> SafariMonkey: since this is before the rule of Celestia/Luna, methinks both royal sisters learned it from the unicorn tribe
<CosmicLatte> But they're definitely just as good at flying as the average pegasus and better at magic than the average unicorn, from what we see
<jcelios> ^
<Everlasting_Joy> AJIsAwesome: Yep! It's funny because it's true.
<pony_115638> hey
<alexxm|colt> djxana if someone asks for ponies
<Cypresswolf> I dont know....Pony history is full of holes
<Everlasting_Joy> Sparta!
<Kandarihu> pony85086, as nice as a nerf sounds, Celestia and Luna by themselves are able to perform the same feat that the entire unicorn race used to do.
<ZZZ> lol
<alexxm|colt> night guys
<CosmicLatte> Night, Alex.
<scout19_tf2> hola pony_115638
<pony_115638> I hate rainbowdash for some reason
<AJIsAwesome> Night, alexxm|colt. :)
<thelonepony> Night alexxm|colt :)
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: MLP Online: Sprites Released
<Socks> The first time I saw this episode, I saw the winter spirits and I thought ":O horses there are no horses in this... show... wait... one...."
<twilight_sprinkle> CosmicLatte: well we've only seen royal alicorns so far
<Everlasting_Joy> Night alexxm|colt!
<ZZZ> lag
<pony_115638> i like spike
<Socks> Spike is best pony!
<jcelios> yes
<CosmicLatte> Yeah, but I take Cadence to be closer to 'average' alicorn (if there is such a thing) than the princesses.
<scout19_tf2> nein
<pony_115638> hes not a pony
<djxana> ouch pinkey
<pony_115638> pinky isnt very good either
<spypengen> can think outside the box, thinks inside a box chiminey
<Socks> pony_115638: ... that's the joke :P
<sonicdude558> dat acting
<CosmicLatte> I also have a theory that alicorns are just sort of a randomly occurring mutation and they're just exalted when they happen
<djxana> a very minty christmass would be a good one to show along side this
<Everlasting_Joy> That bow is adorable on Pinkie.
<AJIsAwesome> Oh, AJ. :D
<Kandarihu> djxana, that's the one with the balloon song, right?
<CosmicLatte> Due to the appearance of that one unicorn we saw, the assistant lady with the long horn and tall legs
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: you act like her atm
*ZZZ drinks pop
<Socks> I wonder how this will end >_>
<Rex_Mundi> Im dissapointed that we diddnt get a new intro for season 3
<thelonepony> being sillieh and all :2
<thelonepony> :3&
<CosmicLatte> I figure she's close to alicorn but didn't get the wings.
<thelonepony> eh, close enough'
<djxana> minty is kinda like a combo of pinkey pie mashed with derpy
<AJIsAwesome> CosmicLatte: I'm not onr to make theories, but I could see Alicorns as unicorns/pegasi earning the ability to become them.
<Socks> I love RD in this scene :D
<ZZZ> *BURP*
<SafariMonkey> Cypresswolf: or it was all 'natural' until Celestia and Luna came and learned to do it by adapting their normal magic
<AJIsAwesome> *one
<djxana> i think so
<sonicdude558> video streams
<scout19_tf2> stream
<twilight_sprinkle> your highness, its just bronystate stream
<thelonepony> D:
<CosmicLatte> I just think it's sort of like how the Cakes have a pegasus and a unicorn baby
<AJIsAwesome> I hope we get more lore episodes in the series. :)
<twilight_sprinkle> rarity must be amazed at seeing ponies on stream
<scout19_tf2> rarity hates bs stream
<Wrek> 05back with an entire plate of ncaho salsa and chorizos
<Socks> :D twilight_sprinkle
<AJIsAwesome> Wrek: NIce. :O
<thelonepony> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<Bronysith> chorizos?
<spypengen> a pony riding a pony? Kappa
<Socks> Twilight has been the most ridden pony in the show
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: You're set for the night :).
<CosmicLatte> I think there's just an occasional chance of a baby that's both unicorn and pegasus, and they're skinnier due to the other accompanying genetic mutations
<thelonepony> chorizo? meat right?
<J_E_Smith71> Pinkie was best suited for this role
<Socks> can't fault her logic
<twilight_sprinkle> you can actually
<twilight_sprinkle> up and down depends on choice of axis
<J_E_Smith71> Rewind, back it up
<CosmicLatte> Applejack tends to be more logical than Twilight
<AJIsAwesome> thelonepony: Spicy pork sausage.
<CosmicLatte> Applejack's brand of logic is just more practical
<AJIsAwesome> CosmicLatte: She's seen as the most down to earth pony of the Mane 6.
<djxana> plus twilight is more ocd
<Bronysith> twilight is CDO
<CosmicLatte> THAT'S NOT A RUBY, RARITY.
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: ah, yeah that, forgetton about how it tasted like
<twilight_sprinkle> CosmicLatte: they both seem logical, sometimes both of them arent
<Bronysith> that reminds me, Mark summers is the best game show host of all time
<CosmicLatte> All time? ALL time?
<Bronysith> on double dare
<Bronysith> i mean
<scout19_tf2> dat EARTH!!!
<AJIsAwesome> Dirtville is best name. :D
<Bronysith> how can you host on a show that gets incredibly messy
<Bronysith> get interactive
<Everlasting_Joy> I love AJ in this episode.
<Bronysith> and be OCD?
<Wrek> 05with cheddar and sourcream
<Wrek> 05omnom
<Kandarihu> The country of Earth
<ZZZ> snow
<CosmicLatte> I would really like steak or something..
<scout19_tf2> calmness<3
<Bronysith> twilight is best pony
<coinflip2> Princess Platinum (Rarity) is best pony
*sonicdude558 brohoofs Bronysith
<CosmicLatte> Pinkie's first reaction to seeing snow is to throw it. Second reaction is to ask where it came from.
<spypengen> the doctor brought those horse thingies to Equestria
<AJIsAwesome> inb4 GET ON WITH IT
<Everlasting_Joy> And they say you can't run from your problems.
<scout19_tf2> RD is best pony
<CosmicLatte> GET ON WITH IT
<jcelios> what that shoeshine?
<scout19_tf2> deal with it
<twilight_sprinkle> prince blueblood is best pony
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: :D
<Kandarihu> For some of us, Snowtactular IS Spectacular
<spypengen> no you're thinking of Doctor Whooves
<thelonepony> AJIsAwesome: YES, GET ON WITH IT!!
<Socks_MacGuffin> For some reason chat won't accept "Socks" as my nick :/
<twilight_sprinkle> raritys voice is glorious :D
<AJIsAwesome> ^
<jcelios> someone already has it
<Socks_MacGuffin> I'm apparently already online
<Everlasting_Joy> Socks_MacGuffin: Check the chat list.
<thelonepony> Socks_MacGuffin: naw, just wait for a bit
<AJIsAwesome> Socks_MacGuffin: I think you're ghosting a bit.
<Socks_MacGuffin> Ah well, this name will do for now :)
<Kandarihu> Mini-tom
<Socks_MacGuffin> Oh look at the Satire-O-Metre it's moving up fast!
<jcelios> he grows up in the future
<scout19_tf2> INVASION
<twilight_sprinkle> pinkie just started war
<otakon> ZERG RUSH!
<CosmicLatte> Rocks?
<Socks_MacGuffin> It's at 1006!
<otakon> GIVE HER TOM!
<Socks_MacGuffin> No...
<thelonepony> Socks_MacGuffin: use /nick, the name is gone
<scout19_tf2> there crossing da borders
<Socks_MacGuffin> Wait...
<Vordoxensaurus> <--- Ponies. WHAT?!
<CosmicLatte> Stomping
<Kandarihu> I almost wonder if Rarity ad-libbed that line about jewels possibly being in the disputed stone.
<Bronysith> Socks_MacGuffin: ITS ON THE WRONG END
<Socks_MacGuffin> It's upside down
<thelonepony> ohai Vordoxensaurus :)
<otakon> wow ponies
<CosmicLatte> Hello, Vordoxensaurus.
<djxana> it's a trap
<Socks_MacGuffin> IT:S OVER 9000!
<Vordoxensaurus> Is it just me that's hearing not what is happening on stream?
<Saturn> 08,01http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14j3fr/teachers_of_reddit_what_is_something_you_do_that/c7dx4e0
<Kandarihu> Vordox, yes. Wrek is streaming a pony episode.
<Socks> Ah!
<scout19_tf2> frozen
<Socks> Feels good to be in my true name
<Vordox> Weak audio?

<Socks> If horses have tails
<Socks> of snow

<Saturn> 08,01holy wrek, ra's streaming!
<Socks> :P
<CosmicLatte> The volume was kinda low, but I just turned it up on my computer so I'm fine.
<twilight_sprinkle> funny, fluttershy was the only one to ever express severe dislike
<CosmicLatte> Dislife.
<twilight_sprinkle> altho i guess its not really her
<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn: Well played :).
<Vordox> Weird, I barely hear anything...must be Chrome.
<Wrek> 05aah this food is goting directly to the arteries
<Wrek> 05but soo good
<scout19_tf2> FREINDSHIP BITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Socks> Fluttershy is pony most likely to end up killing someone...
<sonicdude558> oh my
<Kandarihu> So, Starswirl the Bearded dates back to shortly before the founding of Equestria.
<Socks> It's why I love her :)
<CosmicLatte> Twilight fakes glowy eyes for a stage performance
<Bronysith> Wrek: who gives a fuck? it tastes awesome
<Alchemist> So the windigos are the opposites of chrysalis? feeding on hatred?
<Dark_Horst> my harddrive definately died at the wrong day. this damn netbook is too slow even for streaming
<twilight_sprinkle> friendship is nice, but giant pillars of flame are better
<ZZZ> unicorns won
<scout19_tf2> FREINDSHIP
<CosmicLatte> Ha.
<scout19_tf2> feliz navidad
<otakon> Alchemist: eeyup, apparently there are a LOT of psychic vampire type creatures in Equestria
<Socks> Aren't Windigos canibals?
<CosmicLatte> Lol that face
<thelonepony> KINGDOM HEARTS!~
<otakon> Socks: eeyup
<CosmicLatte> I, Twilight, seeker of everlasting ponies!
<AJIsAwesome> otakon: Huh, then that's pretty dark
<AJIsAwesome> .
<LadyCanary> Ponies? ON A WREK STREAM? Impossiburu.
<Bronysith> run
<Kandarihu> If the ponies who were fighting each other attracted the Windigos, and then moved on to a new homeland where they lived in peace, wouldn't their old homeland be potentially livable again?
<Dark_Horst> amazing. 4 days ago my notebook broke. now my pc too. hardware clusterfuck
<Alchemist> anthem time
<sonicdude558> song song song
<scout19_tf2> hmmmmmm but where did luna and celestia come from
<Saturn> 08,01LadyCanary: which one of you is lyra?
<J_E_Smith71> And that's how Equestria was made
<Everlasting_Joy> I love this song.
<LadyCanary> LadyCanary: What do you mean?
<Socks> And bow
<otakon> Saturn: LadyCanary is Jane
<twilight_sprinkle> this song needs an extension sooooo bad
<scout19_tf2> btw LETS ALL SING
<AJIsAwesome> And here's one of my favorite songs in this series.
<Buytoast> where the hell did they get the idea for the two queen forses on the flag?
<Kandarihu> And that's how Pinkie Pie got her cutie mark
<Wrek> 05poor Dark_Horst :C
<CosmicLatte> I want to have my school choir do this song..
<LadyCanary> otakon: Shush.
<ZZZ> trolestia wasnt there
<Saturn> 08,01what i'm essentially asking
<Saturn> 08,01*sunglasses*
<otakon> Saturn: NOT Henrietta, ALSO! I think we found you a girlfriend
<Socks> One of the best songs in the entire show :)
<Bronysith> since when is lyra canary?
<Saturn> 08,01is who wears the trousers in your relationship?
<Saturn> 08,01yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaah
<LadyCanary> ...Excuse me?
<Everlasting_Joy> I wish an extended of this song would be released.
<AJIsAwesome> Agreed, Socks.
<Kandarihu> Buytoast, obviously the current Equestrian flag that did not exist back then.
<LadyCanary> But what the heck does Lyra have to do with it?
<LadyCanary> Im so confused.....
<Mr_Anybody> Well my day was crap. :S
<Socks> Smile Smile Smile just beats it in my book.
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: she wears pants
<Bronysith> ?
<SkaPunkBrony> HAI
<Saturn> 08,01Socks: best song
<CosmicLatte> Smile Smile Smile gets stuck in my head all the time.
<Buytoast> the only good song is the cider song
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, SkaPunkBrony.
<pony70832> hi
<Buytoast> any other is inferior
<thelonepony> gonna go afk for a bit
<coinflip2> hey SkaPunkBrony

<Wrek> 05ever had a 2x200gram hamburger?
<scout19_tf2> sup SkaPunkBrony :)
<LadyCanary> Okay I really dont understand Saturn.
<Saturn> 08,01spiders spiders spiders spiders
<sonicdude558> Wrek, I had a 1/2 burger
<LadyCanary> ...Once again Wrek, HOW ARE YOU ALIVE.
<ZZZ> ;)good ep
<twilight_sprinkle> Saturn: kill em kill em kill em kill em

<Drew> Full episode?
<Bronysith> still better than dusks dawn though >.>
<Kandarihu> I remember when I was trying to watch an episode of Dexter's Laboratory on a TV that was effectively broken, with all of it's scanlines condensed into a single line in the middle of the screen. There was a scene of Dee Dee running back and forth across the screen and all I saw was a pink dot moving across the remaining line of a screen back and forth. It was funny.
<LadyCanary> MLP: FiM in SPECTACULAR WREK-O-VISION!
<twilight_sprinkle> itd be neat if this had g-minor mode

<scout19_tf2> Haku1013: hia
<AJIsAwesome> Mmm, I like this more than the FiW dub.

<CosmicLatte> The FiW version of Sisterhooves Social is the BEST.
<twilight_sprinkle> yeah, ytps and fiw have ruined half mlp for me
<CosmicLatte> BUY SOME APPLES!
<SafariMonkey> Kandarihu: I assume it was a CRT with a broken vertical deflector plate system?
<Bronysith> friendship is witchract is decent, but it gets way too much love
<AJIsAwesome> twilight_sprinkle: That's why I stopped watching ytps of this show. It kills it for me.
<Purple_Flare> one day im going to dress up as luna and go to the mall
<twilight_sprinkle> well it IS a steep thing
<jcelios> go to the moon*
<Kandarihu> SafariMonkey, I guess so. It was a second hand TV that used to belong to a hotel.
<CosmicLatte> I superglued my wings shut :c
<Haku1013> The race has begun we must run fast jumpyou fell in the mud we can still win this

<Haku1013> AJIsAwesome he tries to kill them because they wake him up a bit violently. Whose to say he wouldnt do that with anyother pony? Against a GIANT FIREBREATHING MONSTER you should send SOMETHING ELSE OF EQUIVALENT STRENGTH
<LadyCanary> Sith. Dont be startin.
<otakon> Bronysith: -_-
<otakon> Bronysith: YER MUM'S A SLAG!

<otakon> I wish we had snow here
<Bronysith> otakon: dont me startin with me, im the fookin japanese military
<Shizuka> 13not when you're plowing it isn't
*Haku1013 lloves and tolerates Bronysith's OPINION
<SkaPunkBrony> Now what?... We seduce him
<Bronysith> dat plot
<AJIsAwesome> Haku1013: He's not trying to kill them, he's showing them away because he's mad at them waking him up. Also, they managed to defeat an ALICORN with the power to cause eternal night and cast dark magic. I DOUBT that they'll be defeated by this dragon. Plus, they have Fluttershy, since she can speak to animals.
<otakon> Shizuka: bah been there, done that.
<CosmicLatte> Lol..
<BroPony|MEDIC> ......
<BroPony|MEDIC> .....
<AlienWarhead> Don't be a whorse

<Bronysith> rarity has awesome plot
*BroPony|MEDIC hasn't told his mom hostess wen bankrupt yet....
<Bronysith> i love how little consitency this show has XD
<otakon> Shizuka: at least you aren't shoveling it by hand, how big is your driveway?
<Buytoast> do ya at least have a scarf?
<SkaPunkBrony> I was this close to seducing him!
<Uncool_girl> haha
<otakon> Bronysith: it's fairly consistent
<flutter_spin> lol
<djxana> oh rarity
<Shizuka> 13long
<Haku1013> AJIsAwesome they beat the alicorn WITH ANCIENT RELICS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE. If youre going to send the 6 greatest Pony heros, at least send them with the stuff they NEED that makes them great heroes
<scout19_tf2> yea pinkys got dis
<Bronysith> Shizuka: id shovel your driveway for a fair price
<otakon> and then he doesn't
<CosmicLatte> He says unicorn or pegasi only.. as usual.
<flutter_spin> lol
<Socks> I don't know who you are, If you're looking for fucks to give I'm afraid I don't have any, what I do have is a particular set of skills, the ability to hug and bake cupcakes, now I will find you, and I will LOVE AND TOLERATE THE FUCK OUT OF YOU!
<sonicdude558> I saw somepony at CG cosplaying at this certain pinkie
<Uncool_girl> rarity is such a gold digger
<Kandarihu> Haku1013, violence is something that should be saved for a last resort. If he can be peacefully convinced to leave, violence can be avoided.
<Vordox> Pinkie...
<sonicdude558> as*
<Vordox> Why Pinkie
<otakon> Socks: lol
<Uncool_girl> haha
<Shizuka> 13at least we have a snowblower now

<BroPony|MEDIC> taste the painbow
<AJIsAwesome> Haku1013: Seeing how they were able to convince him to leave at the end of this episode, I doubt that they'd need any other form of assistance.
<Socks> One day I will finalise that speech
<J_E_Smith71> Whatever Pibkie does is be a screwball
<flutter_spin> strike!
<scout19_tf2> *now
<otakon> Shizuka: eeyup I know that feeling. I bet it wasn't easy for ya.

<otakon> and then Fluttershy HULKS OUT!
<sonicdude558> how dare u
<Uncool_girl> oooooo
<AlienWarhead> FUS RO DAH
<AlienWarhead> Speech 100
<Kandarihu> Haku1013, and as you can see, Rainbow Dash is convinced that peaceful methods are no longer effective, so she tries force.
<sonicdude558> YOU DO NOT HURT MY FRIENDS...
<Bronysith> AlienWarhead: kill yourself
<Haku1013> AJIsAwesome but thats just it, They DIDNT convince him. Fluttershy was FORCED to stand up to him.
<Socks> And so Fluttershy was just hiding behind a rock the whole time. WHAT LUCK!
<scout19_tf2> this is sparta
<otakon> Never make Fluttershy mad, she'll talk your ass into oblivion.
<flutter_spin> lol
<SkaPunkBrony> Yes, Ms. Shy....
<CosmicLatte> I was just testing your love
<Uncool_girl> he got told
<Polydunami> Well, I never expected to see ponies on stream.
<otakon> and RD is like "Hells yeah!"
*AlienWarhead plays and commit sudoku
<Socks> RD is like "Yeah I did!"
<otakon> Suddenly Momma Mode Fluttershy
<Bronysith> otakon: cause fluttershy and rainbow dash are the worst
<CosmicLatte> Commit sudoku..?
<flutter_spin> Fluttershy makes good mother
<BroPony|MEDIC> Polydunami: Thats what i was thinkinh
<CosmicLatte> How do you commit sudoku?
<LadyCanary> Z snap
<otakon> Bronysith: LIES
<scout19_tf2> poor dragon:'( :'( :'(
<Kandarihu> And now Fluttershy takes a hybrid approach.
<SkaPunkBrony> WUT
<otakon> CosmicLatte: 1-9 in a 9x9x9 grid
<AJIsAwesome> Haku1013: Technically, she wasn't forced to. She decided to stand up for herself and her friends on her own since she saw them injured.
<Haku1013> CosmicLatte I think Sudoku is that one japanese thing where you uct yourself open with a sword
<otakon> er hold one
<Socks> "Don't make me call your mother young man!"
<SkaPunkBrony> Get outta here, you
<otakon> Seppuku is ritualistic suicide
<AlienWarhead> Haku1013: I joking about the puzzle
<Bronysith> otakon: i thought that was haru kiri
<CosmicLatte> sUDOku is a number game. sEPPUku is ritual suicide.

<LadyCanary> twilight_sprinkle: GEE, how did you guess? I mean, I like it too, but that version had more bounce and fun to it.
<LadyCanary> The last song that played that is.
<twilight_sprinkle> LadyCanary: peple are allowed to like things that you dont, you know.he only aid he liked it better, he didnt say it was better
<LadyCanary> I mean, to each their own, but if the person is saying it just because OMG VOCALOIDS SO COOL HUR DURR.
<CosmicLatte> I am reminded of the 70s.
<LadyCanary> Then you are a biased motherfucker. twilight_sprinkle, I KNOW that.
<Cypresswolf> He wants something antigue-y, no idea what in that category, just getting him some Hickory Farms, and hopefully find something like that by Christmas eve
<Vordox> LadyCanary: Erm, Levan Polka is from Finland?
<Barbetos> liek this if you cri evertime

*CosmicLatte sighs
<twilight_sprinkle> Fluttershy_ewe: some guy said he like the vocaloid version f a song more, but apparently thats a sin and deserves to be treated as such
<pony_2936> deborah@
<twilight_sprinkle> *of
<LadyCanary> twilight_sprinkle: STOP PUTTING WORDS IN MY MOUTH
<Cypresswolf> I thought about old guns, but those are expensive - but I'm leaning on getting something for his gun room

<Rex_Mundi> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4jkayHs5D1qct99bo2_1280.jpg
<CosmicLatte> Hello, Rex.
<LadyCanary> No. It wasnt. Because if it WAS, then I would know.
<Barbetos> Get a musket!
<BerryPunch> Title on www.equestriadaily.com: Equestria Daily: Daring Do Adventures: Daring Do and the Sapphire Stone
<Polydunami> This is a neat song
<TheGentleManBrony> Someponys overly sure of herself
<twilight_sprinkle> LadyCanary: my point is, you need to stop facedesking and treating people like retards any time they say something you think isnt very smart
<CosmicLatte> I like it, too.
<Fluttershy_ewe> twilight_sprinkle: Oh... well personally I have never heard the vocaloid version of levan polka but you know

<twilight_sprinkle> Fluttershy_ewe: i dont even like vocaloid, but i dont have anything against people who do
<Vordox> FRom Bloodbound to Bloodbound :D
<gdlk_work> thats better
<TheGentleManBrony> At least Vocaloid is better than Glee.
<LadyCanary> twilight_sprinkle: You can stop white knighting now.
<Polydunami> When did that happen?
<SkaPunkBrony> I don't like
<ponyi> LadyCanary: chill
<twilight_sprinkle> LadyCanary: ah yes, the classical "get off your high horse and stop telling me to be nice" card
<CosmicLatte> Stay nice.
<LadyCanary> ...
<TheGentleManBrony> LadyCanary: Maybe you need to turn away from the computer and take a break. Have a cup of tea or a cigarette.
<Buytoast> the hell is a vocaliod
<Buytoast> aint it vacroo?
<Bronysith> i think it is vocaroo

*Shizuka 13stuffs a muffin in canary canary's mouth<3
<twilight_sprinkle> but i wouldnt really know, its just what i usually hear
<TheGentleManBrony> Hatsune Miku's the only Vocaloid I can name
<SpeccyRush> twilight_sprinkle: the part where you stop talking, this is that part
<Fluttershy_ewe> Vocaloid is voice synthesizers
<twilight_sprinkle> SpeccyRush: no thx im good
<RosePetal> Does anyone have any results for next week's movie night?

<CosmicLatte> RosePetal: I know it was going to be George the Hedgehog and then they rereolled because that was too crude or something
<Polydunami> What happened to this chat lately?
<Rex_Mundi> *kidnaps twilight_sprinkle*
<CosmicLatte> I don't remember what the others were.
<Fluttershy_ewe> I guess sort of, not exactly
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: D: where are you taking me?
<Buytoast> i know we get mars attacks! next week
<TheGentleManBrony> I mean it's robots...
<Buytoast> haven't seen that since i was younger
<CosmicLatte> Ah, yeah, that was the other one.
<TheGentleManBrony> sayin a buncha cliche crap
<gdlk_work> Fluttershy_ewe, hey, you're back /)^3^(\
<TheGentleManBrony> Not really interesting.
<Rex_Mundi> *twilight_sprinkle, to the princesses dungeon
<Fluttershy_ewe> gdlk_work: yup owo
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: sounds nice so far
<djxana> then i clicked on this day aria in related vids and thats when i confirmed i was a brony i didnt reveal to all but my crush till second semester of college
<Vordox> Suprisingly good song
<Polydunami> I like this song very much
<Rex_Mundi> twilight_sprinkle: yep, your roomates with Twilight Sparkle
<TheGentleManBrony> I became a brony after seeing Secret of my Excess.
<twilight_sprinkle> Rex_Mundi: sounds perfect
<TheGentleManBrony> because Secret of My Excess was the first episode that I saw the name of on TvTropes
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: you're a prick :|
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: orly, how so
<TheGentleManBrony> Otakon: What the fuck dude.
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: I saw what you did to Canary :| yer an ass
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: ahaha
<TheGentleManBrony> Otakon: she was being a dumbass.
<Vitannia> everyone chill
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: so first she insults a dude for liking vocaloid
<otakon> TheGentleManBrony: no, I've been around this stie LONGER than you
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: what did she say?
<CosmicLatte> GUYS.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: then she calls me a biased motherfucker
<pony_2936> no magic duel
<CosmicLatte> CHILL.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: then its MY fault?
<CosmicLatte> Please.
<TheGentleManBrony> Otakon: what the hell does that have to do with anything?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: and it makes it better that YOU insult her back?
<Shizuka> 13OI
<CosmicLatte> :'(
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: i DIDNT insult her
<Shizuka> 13SETTLE
<Buytoast> i dunno what the hell is going on
<Rex_Mundi> TheGentleManBrony: dude, eerytime you post its something inflammatory, what the hell man?
<CosmicLatte> CAN'T YOU SEE YOUR CONSTANT FIGHTING IS TEARING US ALL APAAAAART
<Polydunami> Seems like we've acquired a bit of baggage here in this chat...
<Vitannia> settle like a souffle
<Polydunami> When do the Windigos arrive?
<RosePetal> Any lottery results? There wasn't any shown on the main page.
<TheGentleManBrony> Rex_Mundi if you were paying attention I was the one trying to be nice
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: all i said is she should be more tolerable of others peoples views, which were stated simply as "i like this version of the song" not even "this version is better"
<aniderp|bestcakeever> hi shizu
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: the fact is you made her look like an ass and then suddenly it's her fault over something that REALLY shouldn't have mattered int he long run.
<Rex_Mundi> *puts a nifty hat on Polydunami*
<Bronysith> why is everyone getting so butthurt?
<Hat> Bonjour
<Buytoast> isn't the A Gladiator or something?
<Vitannia> yup
<Hat> My G5 has taken one rage quit too many, what is a good mouse to get
<djxana> then the first two episode of season 1 hooked me and that was the same day my mother descovered me watching it and asked me why i was watching a show for little girls and if i was gay
<CriticKitten> Oi, are you startin', mate?
<TheGentleManBrony> Rex_Mundi I do actually say nice stuff on here.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: it matters if she does it every time someone says she doesnt like
<TheGentleManBrony> Rex Mundi: I'm not a total ass.
<otakon> no she doesn't
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: tonight, recently she's facedesked but that's it
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: oh yeah? she even called me a biased motherfucker for defending someone who only said he likes vocaloid
<Vitannia> is someone being a bitch or something?
<otakon> no
<TheGentleManBrony> Yes
<Rex_Mundi> Can we chill and talk about something that wont get people angry/ Like politics, R34, and comparisons of bronies to furries, and other safe topics.
<otakon> but considering that everyone started getting her case about it
<Vitannia> whos being a bitch TheGentleManBrony ?
<Fluttershy_ewe> So how's everyone's days?
<TheGentleManBrony> LadyCanary was being a douche Vittania.
<CriticKitten> Rex_Mundi: What you did thar, I see it
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: and you start a LOT of stuff around here, hell remember that goddamn debate from a while back
<TheGentleManBrony> Like straight up Jersey Shore style.
<otakon> TheGentleManBrony: no she wasn't
<Polydunami> Well, that's one against.
<Vitannia> funny cause shes from jersey TheGentleManBrony
<LadyCanary> ....Im not.
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: youre right i do, why should i sit back and watch someone being treated like an idiot for simply liking something?
<Rex_Mundi> Lady Canary is... a LADY.
<LadyCanary> ...I DIDNT SAY THE PERSON WAS AN IDIOT.

<djxana> jersey shore sucks so dose teen mom and honey boo boo
<gdlk_work> nice butterfly
<Fluttershy_ewe> Is everyone having a good day?
<RAWRity> This sure was a great night to come back to Mane chat I see
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: I read what she wrote all she said was "I don't mind if you like it, but a lot just like it for the sake if it being popular" basically
<Polydunami> Also, dude. You don't even know anyone in this chatroom. How can you be certain of your opinion on some of them?
<CriticKitten> RAWRity: Well, you know how it is.
*CosmicLatte hugs RAWRity
<CosmicLatte> We can disapprove together :3
<Cypresswolf> That's awesome Saturn - never see moths like that around Houston - a few hummingbird moths, but those are quite rare around jobsites
<RAWRity> hello space coffee
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: and considering the extremely biased views you have on stuff I LIKE you're in NO GODDAMN PLACE TO JUDGE BIAS.
<CosmicLatte> Harro :)
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: did you also read the part where she called me a biased motherfucked for defending the guy?
<Polydunami> I was hoping for a better mood when I came to this chatroom, to be honest :P
<LadyCanary> ....I DIDNT SAY HE WAS
<gdlk_work> Fluttershy_ewe, it was pretty untill i go at work in 4 p.m. :|
<LadyCanary> I WAS EXAGGERATING
<LadyCanary> FOR GODS SAKE.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> otakon honestly be quiet now
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: and you took it seriously?
<Bronysith> jesus christ
<CosmicLatte> Polydunami: If you pretend the angries are gone it's quite happy :)
<Polydunami> Oy, I thought that was a joke, twilight_sprinkle
<RAWRity> Ya'll motherfuckers need jesus
<Fluttershy_ewe> gdlk_work: Awww
<CosmicLatte> RAWRity, that's probably not called for..
<gdlk_work> 4 a.m.* lol
<otakon> RAWRity:Giant Flying Spaghetti Monster FOR LIFE!
<twilight_sprinkle> otakon: it sure felt seriously. and in any case, facedesking any time someone says something she doesnt agree with isnt polite either, and thats all i said frankly
<djxana> for some odd reason i though a bit of the melody for the first few lyrics to find a pet kinda souded like a dream i dreamed
<Fluttershy_ewe> gdlk_work: Well at least you can go on here while at work
<RAWRity> Seriously, screaming lazer-eyed Jesus painting needs to come in here and blast some fuckers into nonexistance.
<Shizuka> 13twilight_sprinkle: settle, drop it
<CriticKitten> Don't you fillies make me get out my Meanwhile impression.
<CosmicLatte> Meanwhile makes me lol.
<TheGentleManBrony> Meanwhile makes me moist
<CosmicLatte> ....
<Vitannia> http://i.imgur.com/vC8kh.jpg otakon spaghetti monster?
<otakon> twilight_sprinkle: dude, the point is... did the person she was commenting about act like they were offended?
<Shizuka> 13Okay seriously.
<Shizuka> 13Know when to drop it.
<Shizuka> 13You people drag things out way longer than they need to be.
<Polydunami> I liked Princess Luna's appearance.
<djxana> she was talking about me and i wasnt offended
<Bronysith> of course you do
<otakon> I'm done.
<djxana> i accept what she said and i keep calm and canter on
<Polydunami> Right then.
<LadyCanary> Im sorry.
<LadyCanary> THERE.
<Shizuka> 13quarries produce way too much cobble
<Fluttershy_ewe> Look at Wrek's awesome skills
<LadyCanary> WILL THAT PLEASE YOU.
<Fluttershy_ewe> Like just man this looks so awesome
<Fluttershy_ewe> With the water flowing and the rocks
<djxana> yes ladycanary
<twilight_sprinkle> i never wanted a fight, all i asked for is a wee bit more tolerance towards other opinions, im not asking for an apology, and the guy isnt offended either
<LadyCanary> And I have tolerance.
<LadyCanary> But lately, I have been pushed too far.
<TheGentleManBrony> This is for twilight_sprinkle and LadyCanary
<TheGentleManBrony> http://tinyurl.com/ajeq6rn
<Fluttershy_ewe> And the minimap, it still sorta reminds me of a chocobo
<LadyCanary> ...
<Polydunami> That was kind of funny, to be honest
<CriticKitten> Is this still SC2's map editor? It's....actually pretty nicely detailed
<twilight_sprinkle> fair enough TheGentleManBrony
<CosmicLatte> Someone was saying earlier it looked like a cat with a hole in its face..
<Polydunami> Also, I thought we were moving on from this part
<SpeccyRush> TheGentleManBrony: uncalled for
<twilight_sprinkle> also i want to apologize for starting a fight, thats not what i wanted at all, neither do i enjoy it
<Fluttershy_ewe> These graphics are really good
<gdlk_work> I need a hug..........e stick to beat you with
<Bronysith> gdlk_work: that was a post on reddit
<CosmicLatte> Ooh, a fish
<CosmicLatte> No, put the fishie back :c
<Fluttershy_ewe> You didn't shoot the fishy
<djxana> thats ok twi
<CosmicLatte> I liked the fish :c
*Bronysith sits on otakon
<Rex_Mundi> THATS IT, ive decided to use the Elements of Harmony on this chat! Or the Rainbow of light, whatever...
<Saturn> 08,01these guys are adorbale: http://bugguide.net/node/view/230345
<TheGentleManBrony> Holy crap that map in the corner still kinda looks like a pony!
<Bronysith> fluttershy bug Saturn ?
<TheGentleManBrony> Okay not really.
<twilight_sprinkle> djxana: :$
<CosmicLatte> It's like.. it's like a candy bug
<otakon> Bronysith: you're heavy, gerroff.
<RAWRity> Rex_Mundi: use the power of Deception
<Bronysith> otakon: either me or the tonberries
<otakon> Saturn: purty
<TheGentleManBrony> SO MUCH WATER
<otakon> Bronymick: I'll take my chances
<TheGentleManBrony> Wrek x Water
*otakon whips out the Gameshark
<CosmicLatte> Wrek, put the fishie back in the water
*otakon puts in invincibility code against Tonberries
<CosmicLatte> Prease :3
*Bronysith rains down gameshark resistance tonberries on otakon
<Polydunami> Well, Sleepless in Ponyville has a very healthy dose of footage that can be used for an Inception parody or two
<Polydunami> Also, it has been 24 hours
<Bronysith> otakon: these things adapt
<otakon> oh COME ON!
<Buytoast> don't you mean Sleepless in fan Panderingville?
<Fluttershy_ewe> Oh crap! I didn't notice, Wrek did you get ride of the black around "The Wrek Sessions" yet?
<TheGentleManBrony> Polydunami: Remember those bloodshot eyes? Fuckin nightmare face man!
<aji> 4,8loved the episode yesterday
<Polydunami> Hey now, it's still a good episode.
<MusicalSlyp> so wuts dis?
<Buytoast> welp
*TheGentleManBrony bites my tongue and ignores Buytoast
<LadyCanary> And dat kick.
<CosmicLatte> A lot of people liked yesterday's episode a lot
<Buytoast> of course they did
<twilight_sprinkle> i think aji is one of the network mods
<Buytoast> it had moon horse
<Fluttershy_ewe> The yellow it burns
<Haku1013> nyeh
<Starchaser> i like season 3 more than season 2 atm
<aji> yelloooow
<Polydunami> I'm pretty sure aji is an admin
<gdlk_work> i loved next episode
<Bronysith> season 2 was meh
<Wrek> 05hm?
<TheGentleManBrony> Buytoast: Are you getting angry because people like the thing you like?
<CosmicLatte> Also there was a lot of wondering about whether Sweetie Belle's bad singing is a permanent thing or just a silly
<CosmicLatte> Because we all thought singing was her special talent and so on
<Polydunami> I did enjoy the episodes from season 2
<Dusky> Polydunami: naturally ;)
<Rex_Mundi> Yesterdays episode was very slice-of-lifeish. And thats a welcome break from the fast paced episodes that preceded it.
<Buytoast> because people like the thing i like?
<Buytoast> what?
<MusicalSlyp> I want to BuyToast
<twilight_sprinkle> TheGentleManBrony: eh dont bother with him, hes the resident troll
<CosmicLatte> Buytoast: I think he's implying you're a hipster.
<CosmicLatte> I think.
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: who? prince-dari ?
<Rex_Mundi> Im going to a sushi buffet this week
<twilight_sprinkle> Bronysith: him too ofc
<Fluttershy_ewe> Brb guys
<Polydunami> Ok
<Buytoast> i dunno what he's implying but that sentence confused me for a second there
<Bronysith> Rex_Mundi: enjoy the half assed sushi
<Dusky> twilight_sprinkle: there are so many trolls in here >_<
<prince-dari> ?
<Dusky> you need to be more specifit XD
<Buytoast> don't get sushi
<Buytoast> get a burger
<djxana> i'm visually impared i cant read the chat without having to turn up the mag on my mac
<Buytoast> or some sweet potatoes
<jcelios> last night I got sucked into my TV and met a bear and took a huge piss is a weird room
<Buytoast> even mashed potatoes would be good
<TheGentleManBrony> CosmicLatte: In my opinion it's a good thing that Claire Corlett is stepping up to the mic instead of Michelle Creber for once.
<twilight_sprinkle> Dusky: true dat, its still the internet so iguess its not surprising
<Bronysith> sushi is good, but usually mediocre at a buffet >.>
<TheGentleManBrony> Bronysith: I wouldn't know because I'm smart enough not to touch it.
<LadyCanary> jcelios: Sounds like Persona to me.
<CosmicLatte> Yeah
<CosmicLatte> It was just..
<CosmicLatte> Awkward.
<jcelios> ding ding ding!
<Polydunami> Thing about buffets are, people other than the chefs touched my food.
<Rex_Mundi> Bronysith: This place isnt so cheep though, so im going to enjoy some sushi and sashimi
<Bronysith> jcelios: dat persona 4
<LadyCanary> ^o^
<jcelios> ^.^
<LadyCanary> I love my little Kanji figure :3
<CosmicLatte> Wrek, that map's looking really awesome.
<gdlk_work> sushi is good untill you suddenly find huge worm in your head
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: what an asshole, i hate that guy in arena
<LadyCanary> :|
<Buytoast> the hell is a Kanji?
<gdlk_work> a huge worm*
<LadyCanary> Dontchu be talkin bout mah husbando Sith :|
<TheGentleManBrony> I was at a Chinese buffet and the name of it was...like...Delicious Something...and it was AWFUL!
<Buytoast> sounds like that guy from Johnny Quest
<TheGentleManBrony> IT PISSES ME OFF THINKIN ABOUT IT!!!!
<LadyCanary> He's a character from Persona 4.
<Buytoast> ah
*TheGentleManBrony takes a deep breath
<Polydunami> The Kanji script is basically Chinese characters used in Japanese
<CosmicLatte> When you speak Chinese it makes it a lot easier to know when you should leave a Chinese restaurant
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: but kanji is annoying to fight against, one of the reasons hes banned in the fighters guild at my college XD
<Buytoast> next time you go to a chinese buffet, get some crawfish
<LadyCanary> ...LOLO WHAT
<Buytoast> those things are delicious
<LadyCanary> HOW. Just....HOW.
<CriticKitten> Characters banned?
<TheGentleManBrony> DAMN ADVERTISEMENT!
<LadyCanary> That's quite silly. I mean, he's not THAT rigged.
<TheGentleManBrony> BROOKLYN PARK RAGE!
<CosmicLatte> If you walk in and you hear the kitchen staff asking whether to throw some two-day-old fish away because it smells and the cook tells them no
<LadyCanary> If you know how to use Elizabeth, however....
<CosmicLatte> You get up and politely leave.
<CriticKitten> Isn't that in the same vein as those blokes who insist on "no items, Fox only, Final Destination" stuff? :P
<CosmicLatte> The perks of speaking Chinese are many indeed..
<gdlk_work> Buytoast, did you see blobfish there? I heard chinese eat them
<pony_359628> Hey guys :)
<CosmicLatte> Harro, Pony
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: ill stick with protagonist
<LadyCanary> Yu ^_^
<Buytoast> last time i was at a chinese buffet was quiet some time ago
<pony_359628> Um, this is gonna seem super noobish of me, but how do I change my username? :3
<Buytoast> but i dont recall any blobfish
<Polydunami> Blech. I can't stand the guys who want to take the fun out of games.
<LadyCanary> pony_359628: Not at all. We all start somewhere. Type /nick and then the name you want.
<TheGentleManBrony> CosmicLatte: What if they are speaking Shanghainese or Min Nan or Cantonese or Hainanese and you only know Mandarin?
<Buytoast> could go for some seseme chicken though
<pony_359628> LadyCanary: Thank you :3
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: also, never get DCD to be your fighting game sensei, he is relentless
<Buytoast> that shit's delicious
<Bronysith> T~T
<TwilightSonata> Did that work?
<CosmicLatte> Well, obviously I wouldn't understand if they weren't speaking Mandarin..
<CosmicLatte> I'd get quite confused
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: i mean goddamn helpful, but relentless
<CosmicLatte> "What? Eight tones? No :c"
<LadyCanary> Bronysith: I would like him to be :3
<RAWRity> TwilightSonata: eeyup
<TheGentleManBrony> Hey LadyCanary: I'm sorry if I came off as kind of a dick.
<TwilightSonata> Awesome!
<gdlk_work> well, i think if it was in buffet you would remember this
<Polydunami> Hey TwilightSonata, are you new to Bronystate?
<Rex_Mundi> Theres this cheep Chinese takeout place near me that is called 'Wok n' roll' because it also sells sushi. No way in hell im getting any sushi from such a place! Except for like California rolls or something that is barley sushi anyways...
<TwilightSonata> Polydunami: Yeah, a friend told me about this place and it seemed pretty cool, so I decided to check it out ^_^
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: he is incredibly aweosme, giving me guides and RIGORUOUS...training sessions to help me get better as Yu
<CosmicLatte> Eep. I'd stay away.
<Polydunami> Nice. Well, you're always welcome, TwilightSonata
<Polydunami> :)
<TheGentleManBrony> You know where I usually get my sushi at?
<TheGentleManBrony> A JAPANESE RESTAURANT!
<Bronysith> the sea
<LadyCanary> :OOOO
<LadyCanary> PLOTTWIST
<CosmicLatte> No, you get chicken from the sea.
<CosmicLatte> Scootaloos come in a can.
<TheGentleManBrony> I dont trust sushi that isn't from a Japanese place
<LadyCanary> I thought that was buffalo.
<gdlk_work> TheGentleManBrony, lol
<gdlk_work> true
<Buytoast> i've always wanted to try buffalo
<CosmicLatte> Well, with buffalo in a can, you've gotta share.
<Buytoast> gotta taste good to be hunted to near extinction
<TheGentleManBrony> gdlk_work which part are you loling at?
<djxana> derp i bought tostitos without dip
<LadyCanary> Aw man, you dont get the joke xD
<CrystalPhoenix> Aw yeah Pip http://fav.me/d4y1ejc
<Bronysith> ...
<Bronysith> pip
<SpeccyRush> LadyCanary: Great White Buffalo
<CosmicLatte> D'awwh <3
<Bronysith> doesnt work as kamina...
<Bronysith> he just doesnt
<Polydunami> I would've taken him for Simon
<TheGentleManBrony> I'm like the only one who doesn't like Pip aren't I -,-
<Rex_Mundi> People in hawaii and California get most of the good sushi restuants. You got to travel a bit if you want decent sushi in Massachusetts.
<CrystalPhoenix> DAWNUKE http://fav.me/d5ms9cd
<TheGentleManBrony> I get good sushi and, lijke Shizuka, I live in Minnesota.
<gdlk_work> TheGentleManBrony, well, here talking about chinise buffet and sushi and you just mention that sushi is japanese food, so it was kinda funny
<Cypresswolf> Maui had some of the best fish I ever had - tried some raw fish, dont know what type - meat was a dark red while raw - deliscious
<Buytoast> telapia is a good tasin fish
<Buytoast> or however you spell it
<CosmicLatte> My dad makes his own sushi :)
<Polydunami> Tilapia?
*Bronysith explodes
<Polydunami> Wait what
<Buytoast> yeah
<Buytoast> tastes good
<LadyCanary> Tilapia is delicous :3
<Buytoast> too bad it's shitty for your health or something
<gdlk_work> raw fish is dangerous
<Cypresswolf> :3 as long as you dont find out what talapia eat
<TheGentleManBrony> CosmicLatte: Is your dad Japanese?
<Bronysith> gdlk_work: most raw food is
<CosmicLatte> Nope. He's just an amazing cook.
<CosmicLatte> He can make anything you show him
<Rex_Mundi> I so want to go to hawaii one day, not just for the tropical weather, but also im interested in the History. King Kamehameha is known as the great for a reason. And i want to see one of those old hawaiian temples.
<Cypresswolf> gdlk_work: so is raw egg, but that doesnt stop people from eating raw cookie dough and such
<CosmicLatte> Give him something to try and he can tell you nearly every ingredient in it just by taste
<CosmicLatte> And then he'll cook it twice as good
<gdlk_work> yeup... i like sushi then i eat it, but i'm trying not eat it to ofter
<Bronysith> cookie dough is baws
<CosmicLatte> :D
<TheGentleManBrony> ....Hawaiian temples?
<Polydunami> It's not raw meat itself that's dangerous, but the pathogens that can be found on some meat products.
<TheGentleManBrony> AW YEAH FINNTROLL IN THIS BITCH!
<Bronysith> i mean you can eat rare meat...
<djxana> would poppyseed dressing go well with chips tortilla chips to be exact
<CosmicLatte> Hahaha..
<TheGentleManBrony> Seriously Wrek?
<CosmicLatte> Poppyseed dressing goes with everything.
<gdlk_work> some my friends always eating sushi and raw stuff and i think they're going to die sometimes
<TheGentleManBrony> Seriously?
<LadyCanary> In moderation.
<Bronysith> why is rare steak not that good...medium rare is better, and i dont understand how some can eat that shit raw
<Polydunami> Tartare steak?
<TheGentleManBrony> Wrek: Are u trying to be a dick?
<TheGentleManBrony> Ok nevermind
<TheGentleManBrony> its not a big deal
<Rex_Mundi> TheGentleManBrony: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiau
<CosmicLatte> Guys. Be nice.
<Bronysith> TheGentleManBrony: you better rephrase that XD
<Rex_Mundi> Meat is best well done and slightly crispy
<Cypresswolf> when my family was in Maui visiting my uncle's family - Dad's brother - we had ourselves a BBQ - got quite a few wierd looks from the locals - few have ever seen BBQ done right on the island
<TheGentleManBrony> Bronysith: I just said its not a big deal.
<djxana> why is tonight the night of debate
<Buytoast> because it's still the wekened
<TheGentleManBrony> Because its sunday?
<LadyCanary> Hey Wreky, would you be ever so kind to play Raubtier or Fintroll later on?
<Bronysith> TheGentleManBrony: noonono, what you said was "are you trying to be a dick" when you obviously meant to say "are you trying to make a dick?"
<LadyCanary> Everybody's working for the weekend~
<TheGentleManBrony> .....
<Polydunami> Loverboy!
<TheGentleManBrony> okay then.
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: that reminds me...i have finals to work on
<Bronysith> fuck
<LadyCanary> GO.
<TheGentleManBrony> I'm ignoring that.
<LadyCanary> GO YOUNG MAN AND STUDY.
<CosmicLatte> ..Yeah.. I really should actually be studying Mandarin..

<LadyCanary> Wreky <33
<CosmicLatte> Since my final is Tuesday..
<LadyCanary> Mine is...soon. @_@
<Bronysith> LadyCanary: oh shit, not till tuesday
<Cypresswolf> One thing I loved was a burger....what was that called....Moco Loco? it was rice, beef and fried egg with yolk still runny - ^_^ That was wonderful - my siblings didnt like it much though
<Bronysith> i almost had a heart attack
<djxana> my parents moved out i'm 20 and they left a little bit of rasberry voldka and jack daniels is there any sauce i can make with jack daniels with or what would it be best on i cant believe i'm asking cooking advice on a mlp chatroom
<LadyCanary> Hm.
<LadyCanary> Stranger things have been asked.
<Cypresswolf> Darnit! All this talk of food - ya'll just opened up a veritable pandora's box with me - :) I could talk your ear off with good tastin food :D I won't though, not tonight anyways
<Buytoast> the only food you need is the stuff from Nick's Gyros
<djxana> i have hamburger in the freezer tortilla chips i'm trying to create the ultimate nachos
<Buytoast> boy watchin Wrek paint the ground reminds me of paintin a pinewood derby
<Bronysith> pinewood derbys...the memories
<CosmicLatte> Whooooh, just read an awesome fic..
<CosmicLatte> And now I'm reading it again.
<Bronysith> CosmicLatte: thats not possible
<CosmicLatte> Because it's awesome.
<CosmicLatte> It is possible.
<Cypresswolf> I wish I could take you guys on a culinary experience - on all the local favs here in Cypress - most are discontinued now for many different reasons
<Bronysith> Cypresswolf: human trafficking?
<Rex_Mundi> What I want, is authentic Mexican food. Stuff they eat in mexico and not Taco bell shit
<djxana> i'm in eagle rank my pinewood derby car was a mini replica of takumi's ae86 gt apex trueno from initial d
<Buytoast> shit, i almost won my region's championship pinewood derby thing
<Polydunami> Uhh, don't you mean CYPRUS?
<Cypresswolf> Wick's Bar used to have a chef that made the juiciest steaks - at least a pound each
<Buytoast> had a bitchin car pai9nted like the american flag
<Bronysith> i am so thankful for adblock
<Rex_Mundi> But still, im excited for sushi im going to get soon.
<Buytoast> but in the end i didn't make it
<Cypresswolf> Bronysith: :3 As long as you can stay hungry
<LadyCanary> Saying Taco Bell has real Mex. food is like saying Olive Garden has authentic Italian food, Rex_Mundi.
<Bronysith> taco bell is not mexican Rex_Mundi
<CriticKitten> You mean to tell me that Mexican food isn't normally made out of sand, Canary? D:
<cachi01|phone> Taco bell is everything.but.mexican
<Rex_Mundi> LadyCanary: True, i wasnt saying tacobell is mexican, i said i wanted real mexican and NOT tacobell
<LadyCanary> XD
<LadyCanary> Of course, Rex_Mundi.
<Buytoast> hey, taco bell aint too bad
<cachi01|phone> That shit aint got nothing against real tacos
<Bronysith> but taco bell is good...not amazing, but i still eat that
<Buytoast> their volcano tacos are pretty good
<Buytoast> not nearly spicy enough
<Buytoast> but good
<Bronysith> i prefer the beefy five layer burrito
<djxana> next months food project fast food lasagnia
<Rex_Mundi> Buytoast: Tacobell is the food chain that I refuse to eat from. The only taco bells that i ever enter are the ones that are also KFCs
<Bronysith> cause i dont have to spend a fortune and i can fill up fast
<Buytoast> shit, i ate about 30 volcano tacos after a concert once
<Bronysith> Buytoast: thats alot of money
<Buytoast> yeah, financially that was not my wisest decision
<Buytoast> but it tasted good
<LadyCanary> Buytoast: How are you not dead.
<Buytoast> dunno
<CriticKitten> I stopped eating at Taco Bell when it was determined that their meat only barely manages to meet the USDA requirements for being called "meat". >_>
<LadyCanary> So basically it's synthetic goo.
<Buytoast> i'm just glad i didn't get anything on my tuxedo that night
<Bronysith> i just enjoy the taste of the beefy 5 layer
<Buytoast> otherwise i mighta died the next day
<Bronysith> even though the beans could be better
<Bronysith> like black beans and not fake refried >.>
<LadyCanary> Beans beans they're good for your heart :3
<Polydunami> Black beans are SO GOOD.
<Bronysith> my god, my professor responded in 5 seconds after i sent her an email LadyCanary
<LadyCanary> Be thankful you got a teacher like that.
<Bronysith> i know
<Bronysith> and i have to get new ones next semester
<Bronysith> and shes the head of the gaming club....why cant i have more awesome professors like her?
<CriticKitten> Worse, Canary. Taco Bell meat literally contains sand in it. >_>
<Rex_Mundi> A sushi... burrito? What kind of abomination is this!? http://www.tofugu.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sushi-burrito.jpg
<LadyCanary> ...Wat
<LadyCanary> DIESELDODDEN
<LadyCanary> Wrekyyyyy
<Buytoast> that don't look too scrumptious
<Bronysith> and then canary was happy or sad, i really cant tell
<CriticKitten> They confirmed as much, way back when they got sued for their meat's quality. They state that their meat contains "seasonings" like "silicon dioxide", better known as sand.
<CriticKitten> >_>
<djxana> speghetti tacos sound good tonight
<Bronysith> djxana: icarly plz go
<Cypresswolf|Food> :D chat can't take my food talk - disconnected from server
<Dark92Enigma> Bronysith: don't worry, she'll leave
<Buytoast> hell, one of the best wrapped things i've eaten are those ceaser wraps from the Wendy's dollar menu
<Bronysith> hell
<Buytoast> then again, anything on their dollar menu is pretty good
<LadyCanary> Oh man, I havent had a Frosty in such a long time.
<Bronysith> i ate 50 chickfila chicken nuggets before
<gdlk_work> uhoh... now i'm hungry
<Cypresswolf> And virtually boneless! - PO's Ostrich burger, gone as of last january - but they put a food challenge in its place - 5 lb burger - no one's finished it all yet
<Cypresswolf> And if you want the best damn BBQ Houston has to offer - well, not IN Houston, just outside the limits - Carl's is THE place to be!
*gdlk_work starving
<Cypresswolf> ...I think I tempted the chat enough - I think everyone just up and left, headed my way to take advantage of my offer :)
<CriticKitten> I miss Frosties.
<Bronysith> dat split
<CriticKitten> Their Frosty floats were delicious, too.
<Cypresswolf|Food> Ever get food from those mobile taco trucks?
<Bronysith> woah
<CriticKitten> ....wat
<Bronysith> fuck no
<Rex_Mundi> Burger joints are OK, its Taco Bell that I hate
<LadyCanary> ;3; Wreky kicked me.
<Buytoast> i didn't talk that much did I?
<Polydunami> I thought Wendy's still had frosties... ?
<Bronysith> Buytoast: it was a netsplit
<Buytoast> bah
<Buytoast> more fancy talk
<Bronysith> those 50 nuggets were awesome
<Buytoast> but Polydunami brings up a good point
<LadyCanary> They do.
<djxana> i heard louisiana is where the best bbq
<Buytoast> they still make frosties, right?
<CriticKitten> Pretty sure they do, but they're so pricey now.
<Bronysith> 50 nuggets for 5 dollars
<Buytoast> damn
<Polydunami> Well, I live in Canada so, yeah.
<Buytoast> them frosties are good stuff
<otakon> off to watch a christmas speciall
<Polydunami> Also, we still have twinkies
<Buytoast> bah
<Bronysith> otakon: star wars christmas special?
<Buytoast> twinkies are nasty
<Buytoast> you can keep em
<Cypresswolf|Food> Most of them are quite good - my coworker got me hooked on paposa - its a flour tortilla bread with chicken and cheese inside, side of marinated cabbage - with some tangy vinegar - tastes great together
*Bronysith sniffs his ear
<djxana> what about zingers
<Rex_Mundi> I kinda really want to try horse meat, witch is illegal in the USA for some reason.
<Cypresswolf|Food> Im gonna miss zingers :(

<Kencolt> Actually, in the fic, "Earth and Sky", the author addresses that fact. Diamond Tiara is beautiful, and the trophy wife of Prince Blueblood, who married her for her money and looks. She married him for the prestige and the chance to take over the company-- which for all intents she does. It's... not a happy marraige.
<otakon> SpeccyRush: and leave THAT out of here.

<NocturnalBlade> looks cool Wrek and props for just a days work lol
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Sup
<AJIsAwesome> Hi, SpadeKyurem[WoW]. :)
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I really don't like how Blizzard handled the loot system for Pandaria, the whole coin thing is stupid
<CTHULHU> After Hammerfall can you play some power metal?
<CTHULHU> just asking.
<NocturnalBlade> hi SpadeKyurem[WoW] irony is that my friend is in another room playing WoW lol
<LadyCanary> Wreky, Sabaton? :3
*ouo go to fireplace
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The problem with it I have is, you have to go through a ton of dailies to get 90 lesser, hand them in get 3 charms
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You can only do this once a week btw and a max of 10
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You can use it on a boss and have a 15% of getting any loot if you didnt get any with its death
<Buytoast> the elder charms?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> The problem with this is...you dont get what you want, most of the time you can get the same item you allready have, and 28 gold as a compensation is stupid
<wipergone2> fluttershy D
<wipergone2> :D
<CTHULHU> oh shit.
<thegt90> love this song
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> A bag for just gold? Give me some damn potions
<NocturnalBlade> :O Kick Start My Heart <3
<LadyCanary> Dat Motely Crue.
<NocturnalBlade> ^
<LadyCanary> Though I am no big fan of that kind of metal.
<ouo> full throttle with fluttershy
<NocturnalBlade> LadyCanary: i am lol
<sub06905> lol
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I love Pandaria, dont get me wrong, the loot system is utter crap though
<Buytoast> well duh
<LadyCanary> WAT
<ouo> he got message in irc
<LadyCanary> HEY! I used to have that background
<ouo> oh
<Buytoast> it if didn't do that people would whine about their precious loot being stolen
<ouo> steam
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Buytoast: You know whats realy stupid?
<NocturnalBlade> dat DK
<sub06905> dis song
<Buytoast> nearly all of WoW's subscribers?
<r-dash> i used to have the luna and rainbow dah ones
<ouo> 3d ponies look not canon
<ouo> a bit
<ouo> gotta be better
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Buytoast: You can have a max of 1000000 lesser charms
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> but only 10 elder charms
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> THE FUCK
<Kencolt> Per4sonally, I don't mind the dailies, I'm not a big raider-- so far, and I like the sidebits. (And if you're talking the Sha, well, there's only two pieces you can get other than the boots anyhow--and some PVP stuff. I don't like PVP.)
<Buytoast> yep
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> HOW DOES THAT HELP AT ALL
<Buytoast> it doesn't
<ouo> dat twins music
<Buytoast> but as long as they have something like that to keep people occupied
<Buytoast> they can keep milking that cash cow
<sub06905> :D
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I'm fucking drowning in gold
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I had so much gold I could aford a dark pheonix
<ouo> cake!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> and a golden king
<Buytoast> so and get a brawler invitation from the black market
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Im not that rich
<RoboGerbil> spy sappin muh cake
<Buytoast> that'll cost you about 20k
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Still need to work on that
<AJIsAwesome> Not the cake! ;~;
<Buytoast> hell, i got invited to it today
<ouo> spycrab
<Buytoast> and it's fun shit to watch people get killed because they think they can stand in shit and win
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> So can you invite for free technically? But everyone asks for gold?
<Buytoast> you can only get an invite from someone who is rank 7
<wipergone2> rarity
<r-dash> La noire music ftw!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Were invites given to random people or were they discovered via the drop?
<Buytoast> but you can either buy one via bidding on the black market
<Buytoast> not given
<Buytoast> you had to get em from the market
<Kencolt> And what are you talking about-- Brawler's Guild? Or what?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Or the horde/allie rares
<Buytoast> or hope for the 2% drop from the new rares
<VenHur> GMod for comedy related videos, Source Filmmaker for more serious styled videos...
<VenHur> ...You're welcome.
<Buytoast> yes, the Brawler's Guild
<Kencolt> Twilight has books for EVERY occaision, I see.
<AJIsAwesome> VenHur: SFM can be for Comedy, it's just not the best joice.
<AJIsAwesome> *choice
<ouo> give me that spycrab
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> They really need to increase the gear chance in LFR, because its not worth the tedium going through all those raids and getting only gold
<Kencolt> Buytoast: I'm not terribly interested in that either.
<Buytoast> G-Mod is better for the obscene/absurd
<NocturnalBlade> dat Powerpuff ^_^
<Buytoast> eh, it's not all that spcatacular
<Buytoast> but it's good for wanting to show off
<VenHur> Dat Powerpuff Girls.
<ouo> dat window
<djxana> is there any majour fanfics for lps
<Buytoast> plus you get to throw garbage at people fighting
<Punkie_Pue> dat start menu
<Buytoast> so it's all good
<Kencolt> Buytoast: Which I doubt my main could-- ilvl 449 at the moment. Working bit by bit on it, tho.
<Wrek> 05i blame youtube
<Wrek> 05i cant lock to the vid itself
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> You dont even get that much for it
<Buytoast> probably not
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> just a pet and something else i think
<Buytoast> even though most of the fights are just move out of shit, they still hit hard
<Buytoast> boa fist weapon
<Buytoast> or somethin
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Eh,
<CTHULHU> derpy!
<NocturnalBlade> Derpy <3
<VenHur> Derpy!!
<Kencolt> I spend more effort in putting together ridiculously scanty transmogs anyhow. It's known as Magastyle in my guild. Well, at least according to one guy.
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Magastyle?
<Punkie_Pue> haha
<Buytoast> the only thing i'd consider for transmorging are the challange mode gear pieces
<Kencolt> After my main. Magahowl, Dalaran server.
<Buytoast> because the shaman ones look kickass
<Buytoast> giant ass shoulder totems about half the size of your body
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I like the paladin one
<NocturnalBlade> Muffin!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Buytoast: Makes you look like blastoise
<VenHur> Muffin!
<CTHULHU> it's a trap!
<Buytoast> not to mention the tier shaman stuff looks bad
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> the paladin armor looks nice
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I still liek the judgement tier
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I think thats what its called
<LadyCanary> Well time for me to hit the hay. Night all, and thank you for streaming Wreky <3

<Laurayne> lol Shizu-chan
<pony_5545> what about the puntable marmot?
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> that too
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> They only let you kick it once now...
<emangamer> Shizuka~ <3
<Buytoast> minecraft is a dangerous thing
<Buytoast> it consumes
<Kencolt> I may be exalted with the Tillers (and I am) but I'm not paying that much gold for a knife set that serves no real purpose.
<Buytoast> and it knows know end
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Kencolt: I had a shit ton of gold so I did it anyway
<NocturnalBlade> <3 :D
<VenHur> TO THE MOOOOOON!
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Besides I like making people who fail mincemeat
<sub06905> :D
<Kencolt> I... do now, SpadeKyurem[WoW] .
<Kencolt> Do not.
<pony_5545> i bought the knife set when i learned you can use it on team mates
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> Kencolt: You should be drowning in gold man
<SpadeKyurem[WoW]> I easily get up to 1k at least in a week
<Kencolt> Never have been. Just never have been.
<CTHULHU> Dude...

<Kencolt> Ok. THAT was COOL.
