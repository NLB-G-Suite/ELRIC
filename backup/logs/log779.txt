<MirrorImage> Phase4 - which does a heck of a lot of good at pressure
<Ryunosuke> that guy has balls of titamium to do that
<Meanwhile> Totally legitimate idea.
<Yozhel> seems legit
<Rainbowish> That must be real scary.
<Midnight_Fyre> that's how the movie should end
<OohShiny> I want to do that
<Sketch_Toku_Brony> look! Snake gonna save them! :D
<Kemy> The door seemed to explode out, they used some emergency mircoexplosvies to break it out or something
<pony_542901> 'Mazing

<Algent> They could have throwed parachutes :"
<America> DERPDERPDERPDERP: YES IT IS SHUT UP
<Pinkies_imagination> yay
<RainbowDerpy> Soon to be american heroes
<Fenr> sending the first man with 5 parachutes?No i guess,too easy
<Everlasting_Joy> DSNesmith: Because he's an evil communist.
<PaladinDrakkenwolf> he's still alive
<DaringDerpy> fluttercry: the movie is that long? ok
<Zompony> dem PJs
<Afflict> hey Suinide
<Pinkies_imagination> yay
<Vetamin> watch someone fall out of the plane
<pikorar> He's the president... They could always just make another Air Force 1.
<cachi01|ProjDIVA> lol i thought he just dropped him off the plane
<dastreet> that would be fun zip lining over the 3rd world
<DocSane> Wheeee!
<TheSplixer72> Woman and Children first!
<Ta_Dikin> Did he Just say BJ?
<CriticKitten> XD
<marley> Instead of sending men they should send parachutes
<SirGanjalf> ...wat
<Pinkies_imagination> yay

<Phase4> 00,02marley, but that would be logical
<GramptonStRumtperfra> GET A YELLOW INFLATABLE LIFEBOAT AND JUMP OUTTA THERE!!!
<Tovler> And my Bible. Do not forget my Bible.
<Agent> weeeeeeeeeeeeee
<MakerDusk> that would be so epic to do XD
<DSNesmith> well they'll trace the leak back to him eventually
<DocSane> They don't know he's a traiotr

<Filly> WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<pony_9234> when is the spy gonna make his move?
<hidden_pony> "receiving position"? OHH MYY!!
<Deacon> and to think, we've got 4 pony episodes and an hour movie left

<Agent> krazik has a point
<DERPDERPDERPDERP> America: I almost wish you could set it to get beeped for MURICA and MERIKA too, but I don't think you'd be able to hear the movie over the constant beeping.
<Meanwhile> Best zipline ever.
<TheSplixer72> *loses grip* "LOL WHOOPS SORRY BRO"
<Flamma_Man> No, at the beginning of the film, they talked about a possible traitor, then completely forgot about it.
