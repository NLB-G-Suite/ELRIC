<MahBoi777> well, all the smash bros. games are awesome :P
<Simon> I hate LimeV ;A;
<TOY_PON3> I have it on Wii
<Drake> 04The Banshee is cooler
<Sumica> 00,10what's wrong Simon?
<Armageddon> I like Nighthawk better
<Tovler> F-Zero on the Wii U (please change the name) needs to happen
<Simon> Always Server not found
<Drake> 04And I have a feeling my use of the term 'Banshee' is going to cause confusion in this conversation
<Simon> like Phase4
<Sumica> 00,10odd
<Phase4> ohai Simon
<Simon> hi Phase4
<Aircrafter> OMG DONT SAY
<Aircrafter> 8D
<TOY_PON3> dammit!

<TOY_PON3> Really Toad?!
<RandomPoneh> lol
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Haha
<Phase4> Sumica: http://pastebin.com/digK7vDG << dead router
<Zealot> If it doesnt get lasered off spawn than the defenders are beyond retarded.
<Armageddon> hehe
<Red_Pegasus> Silver world?
<Aircrafter> I'm suprised mario just didnt give up ._.
<MahBoi777> Toads need a troll face
<Tovler> Hasbro would have made the trees white
<Tovler> *pink*
<TOY_PON3> Toad is first game troll?
<RandomPoneh> no
<MahBoi777> eeyup
<Tovler> bah, fucked up the joke

<DaniilScit|DWARF> Tampon trees
<Sumica> 00,10that's a lovely string of numbers
<Aircrafter> :S Epic Fail Much?
<Phase4> the router at 206.130.126.61 is dead and its blocking access to limev from some places in the world
<Tovler> PLOT HOLE: Mario can't swim?
<Zealot> If it goes inside, it gets roflstomped by snipers.
<Armageddon> I want to have a second Nighthawk in the sequel, which I'm assuming we'll be making
<MahBoi777> sorry, ur princess is in another castle.....U MAD?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3water hazard, -1 stroke
<Armageddon> Nighthawk II
<Sumica> 00,10I asume your saying you are unable to conect cause of that
<Phase4> Sumica: isnt it :3
<Phase4> Sumica: yeah
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: You're damn right I'm mad!
<Drake> 04NS I doubt we'll be able to have 2 aircraft when we're basically fugitives
<TOY_PON3> :|
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Phase4> packets just cant reach it
<GabeMoist> That reminds me of an image of Toad I saw a while back
<RandomPoneh> how can you guys quote tht fa+
<RandomPoneh> fast :D
<Drake> 04And Zealot, how many phases are there in that map?
<Sumica> 00,10so it's an isp issues or is it teremnating insides limev's network?
<DaniilScit|DWARF> Fuck U HAMMER ROS
<BronyKing> poor Phase4
<Drake> 04If there's more than one save the Snipers for later.
<DaniilScit|DWARF> *BROs

<Phase4> Sumica: its betwene limev and me
<Zealot> That never changes.
<ShinitaiHana> and the goombas following him XD
<Phase4> Sumica: Simon is going along about the same path
<pony_3054> hi
<Phase4> 206.130.126.61 belongs to 'westhost.net' so lets blame them
<Zealot> Crap got real when I got sniper as defender.
<MahBoi777> I know dat feel
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hey
<AttackWithHugs> *feels ignored*
<Sumica> 00,10sounds like US Backbone issue
<Zealot> THEN MY RETARDED TEAMATE TOOK IT AND LOST IT.

<TOY_PON3> AttackWithHugs: Didn't see you there
<MahBoi777> lol
<AttackWithHugs> ohai MahBoi777. I was talking about the idea of a Brony Award Show
<Sumica> 00,10sadly we have no one on to swap embed to mips
<Red_Pegasus> Hay, that star just commited suicided.
<Simon> hi MahBoi777
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Red_Pegasus: LOL
<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: I didn't see you there
<Phase4> Simon: um, thats an invalid ip
<owlicious> 400
<Tovler> That level was hard as hell
<emangamer> one of the plumbers said "I'm like, freaking out man." Then he ate my wife's prized petunes and spouted some drug fuled delusions about spitting fireballs.
<Simon> How can I copy the texts in cmd.exe?
<RandomPoneh> mario should stop stealing goods
<MahBoi777> hai Simon
<Drake> 04XD
<RandomPoneh> :D
<BronyKing> why cant all the mods swap enbeds
<owlicious> he ate some magic mushrooms too
<MistarFish> The star didn't commit suicide it just fell to terraria
<owlicious> man, he was big
<Drake> 04You call everyone who isn't at your skill level retarded and/or a noob
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3: I like to sneak in when noone's looking, lol
<Phase4> Simon: right click and click select, then select text and right click again to copy
<DaniilScit|DWARF> NOO
<Derpy_Hooves88> DENIDE

<TOY_PON3> MahBoi777: That sounds wrong :D
<DaniilScit|DWARF> me *drinks
<RandomPoneh> win
<Drake> 04NS just leave Rhy with the Skyscraper. 3 people can't run and maintain 2 aircraft and a whole host of weaponry at once.
<Zealot> I was doing well, then he takes it off the elevated spawn.
<MahBoi777> AttackWithHugs: awards show you say?
<BronyKing> would never win award
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3: don't make it sound wierd :D
<Tovler> only 1 life left? If this was 3D Land, you'd have 90 lives
<AttackWithHugs> Yeah. My boyfriend and I were watching some of setzertrancer's PMVs and the idea just popped in my head.
<owlicious> And you'd have a super mushroom so you couldn't die
<Aircrafter> .....
<SuperBrony64> 10,02My stream derped for a minute there ;A;
<RandomPoneh> i wonder what will toad say
<Red_Pegasus> You know what I think of this game? Smashinh.
<Derpy_Hooves88> PFFT
<RandomPoneh> Your princess is here
<DaniilScit|DWARF> GAME OVER????????
<RandomPoneh> :D
<Zealot> I got a good mix that match though, skilled people and idiots. Typical MM setting.
<MahBoi777> Fireballs? yum
<Zwingley> a faq did just happend?6_9
<AttackWithHugs> Think about it: we have awesome musicians, artists, and meetups. Why not an awards show?
<Aircrafter> Like I said...Superbrony64, you should play Rainbow Dash Attack.
<Tovler> Back to world 1
<Drake> 04Speaking of spawns, I like how you can put weapos on a 'fixed' physics setting to make them stay still, but when you drop them again they just float in mid-air >.>
<BronyKing> rage quit
<Derpy_Hooves88> ha no fuck that
<emangamer> SuperBrony64: SUUURRE...thats why you died alright ;)
<MahBoi777> SB is now in World -1
<Simon> http://pastebin.com/ANu8ayjw
<GabeMoist> http://www.geekologie.com/2009/08/05/toadstool-is-a-jerk.jpg

<Armageddon> we're not keeping Nighthawk or Banshee
<DaniilScit|DWARF> A dick?
<MistarFish> so close
<Armageddon> they both die
<DaniilScit|DWARF> *disc
<Zealot> I like how Spartan Skirmish has elite weapons
<Armageddon> but in the sequel
<Derpy_Hooves88> YES
<MahBoi777> GabeMoist: I KNEW IT!
<Armageddon> when we possibly go back to stop the war
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Armageddon> we have a heli
<RandomPoneh> play majoras mask :3
<Tovler> Thank goodness. Skyward Sword is the worst game of all time, according to the internet.
<Zealot> Notice my epic double kill sniper headshot.
<MahBoi777> dat little troll
<AttackWithHugs> I've never played a Zelda game...'_' *waits for the ambush of hate and disbelief*
<Armageddon> but Skyscraper survives
<Red_Pegasus> Atleast it dosent have Navi.

<Zwingley> woooo coool!

<Red_Pegasus> Max.
<Drake> 04and we're alone
<Armageddon> Well duh
<Phase4> Simon: http://pastebin.com/d7ZXruie funny thing is when i try to get to my broken one i make it to your broken one
<Drake> 043 people can't maintain 2 aircraft
<Armageddon> I mean waaaaaay later

<Armageddon> but still
<MahBoi777> AttackWithHugs: I only played Twilight Princes9:P
<The_4th_Wall> So my browser finally decides to open the chat frame up again after 5.5 hours
<Armageddon> when we actually get another helicopter
<Simon> lol Phase4
<owlicious> Wiered. I can't reach hosted-by.zenex5ive.com [50.115.119.10] but i can see the stream.
<Drake> 04Well, maybe near the end of the possible sequel she can get her hands on a new helicopter and call it Nighthawk 2 or something
<Armageddon> also we need to come up with names to the aircrafts
<Armageddon> yeah
<Drake> 04But we're not talking abotu sequels now
<Armageddon> er
<Armageddon> model names
<Phase4> owlicious: traceroute, you'll stop right before it
<Armageddon> I know
*kirzstryfe glomps The_4th_Wall, but not hard enough to break it
<Phase4> it ignores ping packets
<Armageddon> we need to come up with model names
<Tovler> I didn't grow up with Zelda.
<GabeMoist> Ohai Flaria
<Armageddon> since this is the future
<Red_Pegasus> I remember this, in one of the season you have to fight Santa.
*Flaria waves
<Derpy_Hooves88> this is everything 80's
<TOY_PON3> hey Flaria
<SuperBrony64> 10,02Hai Flaria :D
<Armageddon> can't use the same ones we have now
<AttackWithHugs> MahBoi77: I've never played ANY of them. Mainly because I had my Playstation for a while then got a Playstation 2 and now the Wii is home with my brother.
<Zealot> I may replace twin grav lifts with a vehicle grav lift. I made an Invasion Slayer version (Based off Fallout New Vegas) and it works well.
<Phase4> ohai Flaria
<MahBoi777> ohai The_4th_Wall, how iz u?
<Drake> 04Easy

<TOY_PON3> Sorry about earlier that was rude
<AttackWithHugs> Phase4: Lol my hard drive stopped working around near-December and I had to use a liveusb of Linux and add school...
<The_4th_Wall> Reminds me of Deadmau5's headwear
<MahBoi777> hugs are a weapon
<Drake> 04You realise that the producers are gonna stay the same right?
<Armageddon> can't we make new ones?
<Drake> 04Like Boeing, Grunman etc.
<Zealot> Also: Fallout NV Hoover Dam Invasion map.
*Simon hugs MahBoi777 and asks, "What's for dinner?"
<Armageddon> maybe
<emangamer> is it just me or does the newest wooden toaster song remind anyone else of hot for teacher?
<Phase4> AttackWithHugs: dead hdd's are the worst :(
<AttackWithHugs> TOY_PON3: it's hokay. I'm a forgiving person.
<The_4th_Wall> I'm back, so pretty good, MahBoi777
<TOY_PON3> yay~
<Zwingley> sam & max <3
*MahBoi777 is hugged, and while gasping for air yells PIZZA MAH BOI!

<AttackWithHugs> Phase4: I know, and seeing as I'm in my 6th quarter of school and I have 2 more left, and Dreamweaver is one of those classes, as well as Capstone. I NEED my computer.
<DaniilScit|DWARF> SKittles
*fillyfillyy likes pizza
<MahBoi777> eez what's for dinner
<emangamer> SuperBrony64: do you have the homestarrunner game for the wii?
<Ingwaz> note to self, small doses of alcohol make me sleepy
<Phase4> Simon: 216.156.0.6 is perfect for me but the next hop (the 206.something) is dead for both of us
<Red_Pegasus> Ill take 100.
<Ingwaz> so, i think i'm going to go to sleep now everypony, night night
*The_4th_Wall may be the first person to possibly have a cheese fetish

<Zealot> NO ONE TAKES THE WARTHOG INSIDE
<Aircrafter> BUT ITS BETTER.
<Aircrafter> 8D
<BronyKing> in 1814 we took a little trip
<emangamer> Aircrafter: I bought my friend a robot unicorn attack shirt once
*The_4th_Wall begins watching Party of One
<MahBoi777> BEST EPISODE
<emangamer> The_4th_Wall: oh, you mean the best episode so far?
<Armageddon> I changed it Drake
<TOY_PON3> i love that episode
<Armageddon> Aetherwing
<fillyfillyy> which one?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3sleepy time for me everypony, have a good night and see you all later :)
<Armageddon> Is it a stealth jet Drake?
<MahBoi777> Party of One
<fillyfillyy> i was just DCd so i didnt see it
<Armageddon> though Rhy could easily equip it with stealth stuff
<The_4th_Wall> Psychotic Party Pony Pwns Perfectly
<TOY_PON3> night kirzstryfe
<fillyfillyy> and yea thats a good one
<MahBoi777> gnight kirzstryfe
<The_4th_Wall> Epic alliteration
<Aircrafter> Hum....
<TOY_PON3> Mods are asleep, post ponies
<TOY_PON3> :)
<BronyKing> along with col. Jackson down the mighty missisip
<MahBoi777> LOL
<The_4th_Wall> :D
<pfsblitz0909> :O
<Drake> 04I figured it'd be multi-purpose
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3: GOOD IDEA
<Aircrafter> I just opened a conversation with MYSELF.
<Drake> 04Like, she'd outfit it with different specs depending on the mission briefing
<Armageddon> Well
<Armageddon> in the name?
<Armageddon> it is a stealth craft by default?
<fillyfillyy> lol Aircrafter
<Drake> 04Stealth Interceptor, yes
<fillyfillyy> it makes you feel important i know
<fillyfillyy> i did that b4
<Aircrafter> @_@
<BronyKing> whats he have to say Aircrafter
<Armageddon> okay wealth
<Armageddon> well*
<Aircrafter> He said...He loves me
<Aircrafter> and will always be with me
<Aircrafter> HEHEHEH
<Drake> 04Originally designed as an all-purpose air-to-air and air-to-ground stealth craft
<Aircrafter> HEHEHE 8D
<TOY_PON3> o.o
<emangamer> night kirzstryfe
<MahBoi777> I got a funneh video http://youtu.be/QerOwpd3WBc
<Aircrafter> -pinky pie crazy eyes-
<Armageddon> Theta-class Ghost Aetherwing Intercepter X9450
<The_4th_Wall> I wanna help pick eps on the Hub
<Zealot> Legend of Zelda invasion
<Armageddon> or Theta-class Aetherwing Stealth Intercepter X9450
<Drake> 04lacks air-to-naval capabilities
<Zealot> omg must do
<Drake> 04Second one, NS
<BronyKing> i see a happy couple Aircrafter
<Drake> 04Adding 'Ghost' there seems unneeded
<The_4th_Wall> DVR= Tardis
<Armageddon> actually
<TOY_PON3> I wish HUB would stop showing MLP so fucking early...
<Armageddon> probably shouldn't be a stealth inceptor
<MahBoi777> ikr?
<The_4th_Wall> Inorite
<Armageddon> Intercepter*
<Armageddon> or*
<Armageddon> because stealth craft aren't designed particularly for speed etc.
<MahBoi777> I can't get up dat early, lol
<Aircrafter> I do not have the time at 6 in the morn too watch....MLP....
<Drake> 04Alright then
<TOY_PON3> We bronies need sleep!
<Aircrafter> I just realized I have hub too @_@
<Armageddon> their design is different
<BronyKing> but then id have yo stay up later
<Drake> 04But then, think
<Armageddon> I imagine Rhy will add stealth capabilities
<fillyfillyy> i need no such thing TOY_PON3
<Drake> 04It should still have SOME stealth capabilities
<Armageddon> Rhy will add them
<Armageddon> and by default all craft have some form of stealth capability
<Drake> 04Like hiding heat emissions, IR detection avoidance etc.
<The_4th_Wall> Dear Hub: 5:00 evening, Bronies AND children are at home
<Armageddon> though stealth craft are better designed
<TOY_PON3> Exactly
<MahBoi777> stream may be dead, but chat lives on, lol
<fillyfillyy> yes it does MahBoi777
<Zealot> Actually, most stealth aircraft move pretty fast. Assuming you aim for realistic.
<TOY_PON3> Dear HUB: Show nothing else but MLP FiM and Dan vs.
<The_4th_Wall> Increase your viewership by OVER 9000
<MahBoi777> HAHA
<AttackWithHugs> I end up sleeping past ponies. The reason I was able to see some of season 2 early was because I had school those Saturday mornings.
<TOY_PON3> Do it HUB!
<TOY_PON3> :|
<The_4th_Wall> and We actually make the showings
<Aircrafter> In Stream, Mortal, In Chat, Eternal, In Silence, LOL CHATS DEAD 8D
<Zealot> Blackbird is an example.
<The_4th_Wall> EVERYPONY WINS
<BronyKing> i love dan vs
<Drake> 04Could blackbird engage in frantic dogfights?
<Zealot> Depends.
<Drake> 04We're going for as realistic as possible while still maintaining drama/action
<The_4th_Wall> plus, I'll buy the lesser demanded figures
<Armageddon> well Rhy will add in vent/grills later
<TOY_PON3> lol
<MahBoi777> HUBDan rocks
<Armageddon> well
<Aircrafter> I might as well record them, until my parents see that I am am and are disappoint.
<Armageddon> stealth aircraft can't match other aircraft in dogfights
<TOY_PON3> Aircrafter: Don't be ashamed
<Zealot> I suppose a blackbird could have weapons.
<Zealot> Yeah that.
<The_4th_Wall> As in this afternoon, this afternoon?
<Aircrafter> YA! TOY_PON3! I'M A TRUE BRONY! I CAN DO IT!
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Aircrafter> ....Eh....Maybe later though....
<MahBoi777> speakin of Dan and MLP...http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz6x82Ryv41r8uiq6o1_500.jpg
<Drake> 04I can't imagine a blackbird doing the kind of stunts I'm imagining.
<Drake> 04Dunno why
<Aircrafter> Eh...I'll give it some time...
<TOY_PON3> Pinkie O U
<MahBoi777> lol
<The_4th_Wall> https://twitter.com/#!/IdidNOTjstsatht/status/168549746502406144/photo/1
<Armageddon> I doubt stealth aircraft would be able to engage in dogfights with other aircraft
<Zealot> Blackbirds can, just dont have firepower.
<Drake> 04Generic jets seem better suited. Besides, Blackbirds were retired ages ago.
<Aircrafter> LOL
<BronyKing> i love that tumbr
<The_4th_Wall> That's me
<The_4th_Wall> In BRAND NEW SHIRT
<Aircrafter> Omg I want that shirt o_o
<TOY_PON3> Cool
<The_4th_Wall> Got it at FYE
<Aircrafter> ...... <_<
<MahBoi777> dat shirt
<Aircrafter> Eh...Maybe I should just wait a bit though...
<Zealot> Banshees are stealth but can destroy anything that approaches them.
<TOY_PON3> shit I haven't been to FYE in forever
<The_4th_Wall> made by Mighty Fine, so available on welovefine.com
<TOY_PON3> dat advertising
<MahBoi777> The_4th_Wall is best salesman
<MahBoi777> lol
<AttackWithHugs> When my tax money comes in, I'm getting a shirt from MightyFine.
<Drake> 04It also happens to look butt ugly
<TOY_PON3> I want a Derpy shirt
<The_4th_Wall> I put it back in bag after taking the pic so no fur
<Drake> 04It is also ancient
<Zealot> Still stealthy and has massive nuclear firepower.
<The_4th_Wall> DAMN PETS
<The_4th_Wall> me 2
<Drake> 04>Nuclear
<Drake> 04Big no
<Zealot> Ancient wat.
<MahBoi777> Oppurtunity
<Aircrafter> I missed the time when everybody went Crazy when it was official that it would be...Derpy...Hooves.

<AttackWithHugs> Aircrafter: I missed out when Rainbow Dash said Derpy.
*fillyfillyy has bought stuff from welovefine
<Zealot> Sir, it is in 2552. Its not really ancient.
<Aircrafter> Now I'm angry...Because I have a friend that was in the Pinkie Pie chat room when it happened.
<The_4th_Wall> Does it work?
<Aircrafter> Attackwithhugs: Ya, thats what I meant.
<Armageddon> >2552
<MahBoi777> AttackWithHugs: U must see it!

<Zealot> I just slammed my head into a wall.

<Aircrafter> I'm looking too convert my friends too Ponyism.
<Armageddon> for aircraft

<Placebo> ohai MahBoi777
<Zealot> Lasers on aircarft. Not realistic tbh.
<Aircrafter> Where Pinkie Pie...
<TOY_PON3> Midnight_Tempest: I said that already :P
<Drake> 04My guess is that it would be something Rhy grabs sometime after Delta Commando dies
<Aircrafter> ....Too..Rainbow dash....
<The_4th_Wall> LOOK GOOD COMING AND GOING
<TOY_PON3> hiii Placebo
<Aircrafter> and then...

<Drake> 04imagining*
<TOY_PON3> Placebo: Sleepy and you?
<AttackWithHugs> Aircrafter: Fitting song was fitting
<MahBoi777> genius man!
<Zealot> Still too early. Effective combat lasers would be to bulky for any use.
<Aircrafter> its stilled burned into my mind.
<Drake> 04More like quick beams to target fuel tanks, stabilisers etc.
<Placebo> TOY_PON3: Haven't done a damn thing all day. So.. great.
<Drake> 04Think the focus rifle
<TOY_PON3> Same here lmao
<Midnight_Tempest> hey... Aircrafter, we dont talk about... THAT... fanfic here
<Placebo> Forced my roommate to watch the first episode of MLP.
<Aircrafter> Sorry...

<Placebo> SOON, he will join us.
<Aircrafter> I just joined today...Still alarmed.
<Zealot> How u gonna make it that small, Willis?
<AttackWithHugs> And then Celestia was socks.

<MahBoi777> Aircrafter: it's k
<Armageddon> oh
<Armageddon> okay
<Drake> 04Conceptualising
<Placebo> fillyfillyy: Haha. well rested?
<Armageddon> pretend I didn't say anything
*The_4th_Wall hands Placebo a 6-pack of sarsparilla
<Armageddon> and maybe
<Aircrafter> I havent been a brony for long either
<fillyfillyy> i was running on 28 hours of no sleep
<Drake> 04NS
<Armageddon> atm laser weapons are like
<Drake> 04Give the plane a rail/coilgun
*Drake runs
<The_4th_Wall> Good job
<Placebo> Ouch. So, roughly caught up? lol
<TOY_PON3> I know right?
<Aircrafter> For the first few days I couldnt get enough of it :P
<Armageddon> the size of 3 trucks
<fillyfillyy> what happened was
<BronyKing> has been brony since July
<Midnight_Tempest> Aircrafter: I see... well its a shame you had to be subjected to that fanfic... try reading Fallout Equestria, THAT is an epic fanfic
<Zealot> Anti-material plane.
<TOY_PON3> I became a brony right after season 1 ended
<Armageddon> don't think they'll have downsized to usable aircraft weaponry by then
<Zealot> ^^^^
<The_4th_Wall> I'm new on Bronystate, but a Brony of half a year
<fillyfillyy> i decided i had the energy to be able to lay on my bed for half a second and then i passed out
<Placebo> Midnight_Tempest: Truer words have never been spoken.
<Drake> 04my railgun idea or the lasers?
<Zealot> .50 rounds on a plane in 2069 sounds right.
<Aircrafter> Fallout...and Equestria!? MY Two favorite things!?
<The_4th_Wall> Mee
<The_4th_Wall> too
<Midnight_Tempest> Placebo: /)
<Aircrafter> Noooooooooo -head splosion-
<MahBoi777> I became a brony because of a guy on youtube named kyrospawn
<The_4th_Wall> @toy
<fillyfillyy> TOY_PON3 i became a brony right when the day after The Last Roundup came out
<Placebo> Aircrafter: Don't start it unless you have enough free time. At over 600,000 words, Your looking at about 50 hours of reading time
<owlicious> what?
<Placebo> Midnight_Tempest: (\
<The_4th_Wall> Bro converted me
<Aircrafter> Oh I have plenty of time.
<Aircrafter> =w=
<TOY_PON3> I converted myself
<Placebo> Then I highly recommend it.
<Drake> 04well
<Drake> 04NS
<BronyKing> Aircrafter: http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/04/story-fallout-equestria.html
<fillyfillyy> my friend converted me
<TOY_PON3> fillyfillyy: That's really late
<Drake> 04http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_Laser
<Placebo> MahBoi777 sneaked ponies into my youtube, and converted me >_>
<fillyfillyy> i know
<MahBoi777> LOL
<AttackWithHugs> I became a brony through the music.
<Aircrafter> XD Already googled it.
<Midnight_Tempest> Aircrafter: the fix is bloody brilliant, and emotionally charged... a definate must read for any Fallout fan
<Drake> 04Not saying it's possible
<Drake> 04But give it some consideration
<The_4th_Wall> Went from Stage 1: WTF is this shit to Stage 5: All hail Equestria!
<Zealot> A more realistic weapon would be nuclear missles.
<ShinitaiHana> I heard who created it... watched willingly :P
<SlurryMoon> 3Night all you ponies! :3
<Midnight_Tempest> fic*
<Placebo> SlurryMoon: sleep tight.

<The_4th_Wall> I'm being stalked by a golden retriever
<Drake> 04But we don't want to shoot mini-stars at our enemies.

<Zealot> "More energy was released in the first moments of the Great War than all of the previous human conflicts in the history of the world combined. Entire mountain ranges were created as the ground buckled and moved under the strain of the cataclysmic pressure produced by numerous, concentrated atomic explosions. Rivers and oceans around the world were contaminated with the resulting radioactive
<Zealot> fallout released by the relatively low-yield nuclear weapons used by all sides, and the climate changed horrifically. All the regions of the Earth suffered from a single, permanent season once the initial dust blasted into the atmosphere by the nuclear explosions had settled - a scorching, radioactive desert summer.

*Hazard3 thinks Robin likes batpellets
<Midnight_Tempest> counting bullets... BS!
<Drake> 04Star Wars vehicles don't make sense in general
<AttackWithHugs> The bat shield can shield from the FRONT, but not the back and sides. I wonder if they thought of that, hmm?
<Roxsnow> wah wah wah?
<Armageddon> probably not
<Placebo> Perfect plan?
<Armageddon> But I was imagining guns like that
<Armageddon> except
<Placebo> Needs moar bullets.

<Armageddon> [18:46:28] <~Armageddon> Rhy has a few rotating guns though, Drake
<Armageddon> [18:46:37] <~Armageddon> but most of them are forward facing
<Armageddon> [18:46:44] <Drake> Rotating guns?
<Armageddon> [18:46:48] <Drake> You mean gatling guns?
<Armageddon> [18:46:52] <~Armageddon> whatever you call them

<Aircrafter> Penguin in prison, escaped, batman stopped, they ended up escaping though, did the prison trap, batman lost case, now hes doing some random crap.
<Drake> 04A jet does not have rotating guns because it fucks up the aerodynamics
<Drake> 04a lot
<MahBoi777> here's batman as a pony http://img.ponibooru.org/_images/6acf20bdfcc7b5af322191ad02a507b5/20958%20-%20Batman%20ponified%20why.gif *troll face*

<Sumica> 00,10soon™
<Armageddon> they don't constantly rotate
<Bureksasutlijom> What time is it? (where this is airing)
<Aircrafter> Thats just plain scary.
<Drake> 04When a plane has enemies on their tail they manouever to get around them
<Armageddon> otherwise that'd be too hard to control
<Armageddon> yes
<MahBoi777> HAHAHAHA:D
<Armageddon> but still
<AttackWithHugs> Mother of god...
<Drake> 04Not spin their guns around
*Roxsnow is not sure to feel scared or wtf
<Armageddon> rotating guns are fun
<The_4th_Wall> Night, all
<Aircrafter> ....Can I get a yay <_<
<Armageddon> and by whatever year we're in
<Drake> 04Because then it's not a plane it's just a fucking weapons platform

<Phase4> MahBoi777: all mah what
<Roxsnow> Night The_4th_Wall : 3

<Armageddon> planes are flying weapons platforms
<Roxsnow> or today you mean
<MahBoi777> Phase4: problem?
<Aircrafter> -sigh- My dreams always go unfufilled.
<Armageddon> and they didn't give it to Rhy
<Armageddon> she modified it
<The_4th_Wall> because Bronystate is a drug
<Roxsnow> Aircrafter, just say the magic word : 3
<Sumica> 00,10need that picture
<The_4th_Wall> I LOVE YOU GUYS
<Drake> 04A gun

<Drake> 04does
<Drake> 04not
<Drake> 04rotate
<Aircrafter> Extra Super Duper Super Extra Please :D?
*Armageddon rolls eyes
*Roxsnow hugs The_4th_Walls
<Drake> 04because
<Drake> 04THEN
<Sumica> 00,10is it realy a secret if you labelit?
<Armageddon> it also attacks enemies from the side
<Drake> 04You're overpowering her
<Armageddon> okay fiiiiiiine
<Midnight_Tempest> yup
<Roxsnow> hey Sumica, what is the magic word?
<Drake> 04Missiles, 6 machine guns
<Drake> 04a RAILGUN
<Bureksasutlijom> Cupcakes?
<Midnight_Tempest> no one looks in the SECRET refridgerator
<Sumica> 00,10blatherskype
<Armageddon> railgun needs time to reset its position
<Drake> 04Not to mention the TYPES of missiles she has
<Armageddon> well
<Midnight_Tempest> darkwing duck ref
<Midnight_Tempest> and duck tales
<Armageddon> I don't think she can have more than 4 missiles
<Drake> 04And the railgun does not rotate
<Sumica> 00,10Ducktales actaly
<Armageddon> of course not you fucktard
<Armageddon> why would THAT rotate
<MahBoi777> ^
<Drake> 04Then why do you say "reset its position"?
<Sumica> 00,10did they have gismoduck in darkwing?
<Armageddon> because
<Armageddon> it fires
<MahBoi777> yes
<Midnight_Tempest> yup
<Sumica> 00,10dem hips
<Placebo> Plants vs Zombies on steam for 1.99..
<Bureksasutlijom> You can rewrite history...
<Placebo> Yes please.
<Armageddon> and as to not overpower it
<Armageddon> just saying it needs to reset the mechanics
<AttackWithHugs> How is Plants vs Zombies?
<Armageddon> almost like recharging
<Armageddon> then load the next bullet
<MahBoi777> Discord!
<Midnight_Tempest> GismoDuck made a few appearances on Darkwing
<Roxsnow> SuperBrony64 played it one time, it looked fun
<Roxsnow> : 3
<Drake> 04ok
<Drake> 04fine
<AttackWithHugs> Cool
<Armageddon> [18:43:05] <~Armageddon> Let's put it this way
<Drake> 04Honestly I'm starting to think it doesn't need a railgun
<Armageddon> [18:43:18] <~Armageddon> the cannon needs time to set back into its original position
<Armageddon> [18:44:00] <~Armageddon> It's always forward facing
<Armageddon> [18:44:05] <~Armageddon> no rotating
<Armageddon> [18:44:20] <~Armageddon> And it's mounted inside the aircraft like the missiles
<Armageddon> [18:44:37] <~Armageddon> and when activated, pops out and fires
<Drake> 04In what conceivable way could Rhy put a railgun on a jet
<owlicious> :O
<Roxsnow> dang it... can't stop staring at miss fanservice.....
<MahBoi777> epic pie time!
<Drake> 04She's not that smart

<Roxsnow> you think Sumica : o?

<Aircrafter> Thats a Nice Hat.
<owlicious> Oh pastries, pastries
<MahBoi777> that IS a nice hat
<Bureksasutlijom> Adam West, actor
<Aircrafter> Thats a nice pie.
<TOY_PON3> holy crap, I found out Valve released a free mod in Skyrim in which you can have Space Core in the game :o
<Armageddon> And Drake
<Aircrafter> SPACE WA WA WHAT!?
*Roxsnow can't stop staring at miss fanservice....
<Bureksasutlijom> aren't all mods free?
<Armageddon> railgun requires "recharging" so she can't constantly use it
<Kipkat07> lol its dick
<MahBoi777> TOY_PON3: you serious? that's awesome!
<Drake> 04We established that
<Armageddon> I know
<Drake> 04multiple times
<TOY_PON3> well Valve specifically released it
<Bureksasutlijom> Dicky boy XD
<BronyKing> they didnt bake the pie
<Drake> 04Goddamnit this is frustrating
<Armageddon> just in case you didn't get it after we established it multiple times
<owlicious> :D
<MahBoi777> A PARTY
<Roxsnow> gay party?
<Bureksasutlijom> SSX Dicky
<Drake> 04You're trying to turn the Skyscraper into some sort of superjet
<owlicious> Grace, Dick
<Armageddon> lmfao
<MahBoi777> Roxsnow: lmao
<Armageddon> no I'm not
<Drake> 04I'm beginning to realise having a railgun on a jet is impractical
<Armageddon> >future
<Aircrafter> Holy godly batman. We go up giant poles.
<Armageddon> okay.jpg
<Drake> 04breaking the aerodynamics

<Armageddon> Rhy needs something that's not as limited as missiles and more powerful than guns
<Drake> 04to be about skill more than a superawesome jet
<TOY_PON3> magic
<Armageddon> yes I know
<MahBoi777> gotcha

<owlicious> It certainly is Dick
<Bureksasutlijom> I think my campy gland has just erupted
<Drake> 04And NS, not really.
<MahBoi777> LOL
<Armageddon> well

<CountDoofus> Fluttershy for me
<CountDoofus> whiiiiich I wasn't supposed to answer here (derp)

<PonyFlare> Probably just you
<Phase4> ok then
<Kammerjunk> So I didn't manage to find you yet. But I'm still finding ponies left and right.
<Poundcake> Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections?
<Jim> Because they'll kill them if they don't
<Jim> oh, wait..
<Phase4> you'll find theres some legal reason why they have to
<Phase4> unsterilized needles can allso hurt
<Poundcake> yeah but its a LETHAL injection
<PonyFlare> Don't ask, just accept that that's the way it is.
<Jim> Guess they sterilize them to make it as clean as possible, with reduced risk of unneccissairy pain for the victim
<Poundcake> i have so many stupid question its rediculous
<Kammerjunk> Hey guys, what if air is actually poisonous, but it just takes 80 years to kill us?
<Jim> It actually is
<Kammerjunk> conspiracykeanu.jpg

<Jim> our cells gets more and more damaged
<Kammerjunk> Hm.
<Kammerjunk> You know what? I give up.
<Kammerjunk> I literally have an easier time finding myself thrice on Omegle..
<Jim> Not easy finding people on Omegle, ey?
<Kammerjunk> I have managed multiple times making myself the asker, Stranger 1 and Stranger 2.

<Jim> So I stabbed him and took his mints
<Thunderpony> So i saw the summery of the new twilight episode
<Thunderpony> I can't believe that twilight learns how to travel through time
<MirrorImage> spoilers dude
<Thunderpony> It's on EQD
<MirrorImage> behind a spoiler tag
<Thunderpony> It won't be out until the 10th of march
<Thunderpony> How is that a spoiler?
<Princess_Luna> ...sorry to break the silence, but what is going on?
<MirrorImage> because it reveals details that someone who hasn't seen the episode wouldn't know
<Thunderpony> No one has seen the episode
<MirrorImage> exactly
<Thunderpony> -_-
<MirrorImage> and i believe people have been kicked for episode summary spoilers before
<Thunderpony> Are you kidding me? They regularly post EQD updates so you get kicked for repeating one of the updates?
<Princess_Luna> Anypony home?
<Sheepy> if anyone wants to wach a stream just ask me for the link
<Sheepy> then hopefully we can revive this chat with something
<Thunderpony> FFFFFFFFFFFF :O that
<Thunderpony> I'm too bored to do anything
<Princess_Luna> (revive the chat, hmm...?) I would even watch a stream of G1 just to have some background noise...
<Sheepy> well here's the link www.livestream.co/ishepy
<Sheepy> www.livestream.com/isheepy **
<Princess_Luna> ...seriously...?...I was only...
<Princess_Luna> I thought we weren't supposed to link...

<Sheepy> Anything but g1 - g3.5
<TheSonicdude97> Howdy' everypony!
<Princess_Luna> Hello Sonic!
<TheSonicdude97> Princess_Luna Hi!
<Princess_Luna> Would you mind brushing my mane for a bit? By the way, did you know I've been a filly for a month now? I shouldn't have touched that spell book...
<Saturn> Princess_Luna: we're not using these channels anymore; only for pony episodes
<Saturn> otherwise, these channels are closed
<Saturn> use #bronystate instead
<Saturn> 08,01good morro everypony
<Princess_Luna> Hmm...how am I here then? The episodes didn't let me in here? Did you mix up the explanation?
<TheSonicdude97> Well, i'm not a very good hair brusher, these quills of mine were grown naturally spiky. And with the filly problem, maybe you should consult Twilight Sparkle
<Jim|dinner> ohai Saturn
<DashWithRainbows> Saturn go to bed :3
<Princess_Luna> I...don't want to show Twilight...it's kind of embarrassing having your sisters apprentice see you little...
*Saturn 08,01grabs a brush in his mouth and procedes to brush Princess_Luna's mane
<Saturn> 08,01DashWithRainbows: why?
<Saturn> 08,01it's 2:40pm
<Princess_Luna> thank you Saturn...
<DashWithRainbows> Saturn because reasons...
<fillyfillyy> its 9:40 AM :P
<Saturn> 08,01DashWithRainbows: only if you're offering to be in the same bed
<DashWithRainbows> Saturn ...Not sure if want...
<Saturn> 08,01<3
<TheSonicdude97> hmmm... true... Try looking in that same book but carefully this time and look for a spell to change you back.
<Princess_Luna> Well...the spell was sort of made by a psychopathic unicorn...I don't think I'll find a cure...
<DashWithRainbows> You wanna know something Saturn? Today when I woke up, I had half a bacon sandwich in my mouth...and I didn't even know we had bacon...
<DashWithRainbows> Still ate it anyways.
<Princess_Luna> I have cookies instead of bacon, good enough?
<DashWithRainbows> Nope, Bacon always wins.
<DashWithRainbows> even against itself.
<Princess_Luna> ...aw...

<Kipkat07> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCx7RpWme9w&feature=g-hist&context=G27a008aAHTyw13wAAAA
<DashWithRainbows> But cookies are high up though.
<TheSonicdude97> Tell me where this psychopatic unicorn is and I'll go deal with him myself. No one messes Princess_Luna !!!
<Princess_Luna> Hello, my mailmare! and yes cookies are great...
<Princess_Luna> The unicorn has been dead for five centuries...
<TheSonicdude97> Umm... Dang it... (looks embarassed)
<Princess_Luna> It's fine...I've dealed with it thus far...(as long as I make it to a year...)
<Saturn> 08,01DashWithRainbows: but... how can you say no to someone drinking a juice box? http://imgur.com/o9uXx
<TheSonicdude97> Get Zecora! The Zebra!!!
<Derpy_Hooves> i need to get ahold of either violetvanilla or any other mod thats awake
<DashWithRainbows> Saturn I was distracted by the homer picture in the background.
*Jim stares at screaming homer
<Princess_Luna> A potion for a spell...I would sooner jump dimension and look for the Celestiadamned chaos emeralds...
<DashWithRainbows> but still, dat juicebox looks mighty tasty.
<TheSonicdude97> I can lend you them but I don't know what good they'll do... their more for reviving and giving power, not breaking spells, sigh.
<Princess_Luna> ...I'll just wait it out instead...
*emangamer yawns and scratches his eyes...
<Princess_Luna> You're still brushing, right +Saturn?
<Kipkat07> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCx7RpWme9w&feature=g-hist&context=G27a008aAHTyw13wAAAA
<TheSonicdude97> If you wish... Say! Maybe you'll cheer up if I bring you to a friend of mine, a hairstylist, he can get you practically any hair style! Even mine if you want! Spikes wouldn't look bad, eh?
<Cypresswolf> :) Not sure what was on the stream after I left, but it seems to have left everypony exhausted
<Ice_blade> Hi
<Cypresswolf> Morinng
<Princess_Luna> Hmmm...Now that my hair is already stopped glowing and all...I guess it wouldn't hurt Sonic...
<Ice_blade> Lol
<CountDoofus> Can I bother somepony by having them check out my drawing?
<Jim> yeah, sure
<Jim> just link it here
<Princess_Luna> I don't think so, I would like to see it...
<CountDoofus> http://countdoofus.deviantart.com/#/d4pguq1
<CountDoofus> work in progress, fyi
<CountDoofus> also, bad camera
<Jim> oh my, that looks good
<Saturn> 08,01http://i.imgur.com/fSeJe.png
<Jim> hahaha Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01CountDoofus: that... IS AWESOME
<Derpy_Hooves> i need to get ahold of either violetvanilla or any other mod thats awake
<CountDoofus> :O
<Cypresswolf> Looking good, :) I look forward to the finished product
<Princess_Luna> Derpy_Hooves, my mailmare, just PM them by right clicking their name and opening a query.
<CountDoofus> If I can just find a way to upload that page to my hard drive without using an iPhone camera, that'll be grand
<CountDoofus> thanks for the comments though :)
<Derpy_Hooves> tthey are all asleep :P
<Jim> CountDoofus: You could try buying a scanner
<Princess_Luna> That...sucks...but it explains why ponies aren't getting kicked for links...
<CountDoofus> stepdad has one, I'll nab his :$
<fillyfillyy> ...
<fillyfillyy> chat ded
<Jim> hnnnngg
<Cypresswolf> How about Hasbro's White Celestia? :)
<Jim> I love it and I want it naoooo
<Cypresswolf> This is why we need time machines
<fillyfillyy> why u specify white celestia?
<CountDoofus> I'll have that Vinyl Scratch tyvm
<fillyfillyy> is there a black one too?
<fillyfillyy> or red
<Cypresswolf> It was the first pic I saw of that new pony product post
<fillyfillyy> or brown?
<VinylScratch> Over my dead body
*VinylScratch takes ALL the vinyl toys
<VinylScratch> >:3
*fillyfillyy steals VinylScratches stuff
<CountDoofus> because the first Princess Celestia toy was pink
<VinylScratch> D:
<VinylScratch> qq
<fillyfillyy> :P
<CountDoofus> there shall be pink but Pinkie Pie!
<Cypresswolf> I'll have to spend alot less time on ebay til they are released. Extremely happy about the Vinyl Scratch toy, vinyl has gone quite high in several aucions
<Cypresswolf> *auctions
<CountDoofus> and that for a background pony that has been in just 1 episode, on screen for no more than 3 seconds
<Cypresswolf> *Vinyl Customs
<Cypresswolf> That NEVER happens! Outlaw Star didnt even produce a full line of character toys!
*fillyfillyy dies of bordom
<Cypresswolf> Gene Starwind & Melfina were the only chara's made into figures.
*Sheepy Digs hole puts fullyfillyy in it
*Sheepy fillyfillyy *Facehoove*
<Cypresswolf> Then Official Trixie & Nightmare Moon! ^_^ Some of my customs will have to move over
<EpicStatsGuy> Murrrnapples :3
<CountDoofus> Ponies the Anthology on YT. you're welcome
*fillyfillyy is burried
<Cypresswolf> If Hasbro is coming out with real Celestia & DJ Pon3 - Derpy Hooves won't be much of a long wait after
<CountDoofus> or a Doctor Whooves
<Cypresswolf> Yes!
<CountDoofus> Colgate, Berry Punch, Lyra, Bon Bon... the list goes on ^^
<Cypresswolf> somepony in EQD's comments suggested Hasbro come out with costumes of Daring Do, Mare-Do-Well, Nightmare Night with their Pony Play sets! I'd be happy to buy them, if those costumes were included
<MirrorImage> the only problem with that is that the costumes would be sized for a 10 year old, at best
<MirrorImage> or... wait, you mean for the toys?
<Cypresswolf> I'd buy them only for the costumes, but I digress
<Cypresswolf> Yes
<Cypresswolf> for toys
<fillyfillyy> lol
<Cypresswolf> O_O I hope they come out with toys for the creatures Equestria has: Timber Wolves, Ursa Minor, Ahuitzotl, Parasprites...
<CountDoofus> butbutbut my wallet!
<Cypresswolf> My wallet is light too...from all those customs...
<EspyLacopa|2> lol, derpy in the land of muffins.
<mario_pony> hello everypony is anyone streaming?
<CountDoofus> hi, and don't think so
<Cypresswolf> sheesh, spent over 180 on a Gilda Griffon custom alone
<Jim> you have a gilda costume? Awesome!
<CountDoofus> *anger level rising* Gilda...
<Dumori> lol
<Dumori> Gilda isn't that bad
<otakon17> Hiya guys
<CountDoofus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTQazPuO6Z4
<Cypresswolf> Made from an artist in Houston :) Gilda is all Texan ^_^
<otakon17> Just popping in a moment
<CountDoofus> nopony (or gryphon) makes a Fluttershy cry!
<CountDoofus> and hi :)
<otakon17> Hiya moop
<moop> is there anything on the stream?
<Kammerjunk> At least I can excuse Trixie for just trying to make a living.
<otakon17> No idea
<Cypresswolf> ebay page is gone :( been too long
<Kammerjunk> With Gilda, I can not.
<mario_pony> hello moop and otakon17!!!
<otakon17> Hiya mario_pony
<CountDoofus> (funny how Gilda says part of my nickname in that clip)
<mario_pony> i heard on the news someone tried to sell a baby on ebay.
<otakon17> Not surprising
<moop> hi otakon17 and mario_pony
<Cypresswolf> http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo309/woosiemlp/Pony%20Customs/gilda1.jpg - This one! Artist Woosie
<Kammerjunk> "Why don't you just watch where you're going, CountDoofus?!" just doesn't sound as good.
<otakon17> They should have used Craigs List
<CountDoofus> :D
<moop> I have to admit i kind of hate Gilda
<Kammerjunk> It's okay. Most bronies do.
<otakon17> I don't hate Gilda
<Kammerjunk> I just really really really really dislike her.
<Cypresswolf> I love her character design.
<Kammerjunk> ^
<otakon17> Wat Kammerjunk said
<mario_pony> hot dog hot dog hotdog hotdog hot diggedy dog
<otakon17> Um
<Cypresswolf> Until given a voice, character is a blank slate
<otakon17> mario_pony: Have u been watching Mickey Mousapedes?
<Kammerjunk> It's the same with canon Trixie for me. I like the character for the personality, but not because it's a likable character.
<mario_pony> nope mickey mouse clubhouse
<otakon17> Ah
<otakon17> Same diff
<Cypresswolf> http://texasbronygroup.4umer.com/t41-pony-collection-thread - posted almost my entire collection here, under Cypresswolf
<otakon17> But WRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYY?
<mario_pony> is cuz my younger brother loves it.
<Kammerjunk> Fanon Trixie, however, I absolutely adore.
<Cypresswolf> I've bought alot more customs since then
<Saturn> 08,01gilda is awesome

<Saturn> 08,01i <3 her

<Saturn> 08,01i had a girlfriend like her once...
<Saturn> 08,01wasn't a gryphon.
<Saturn> 08,01(unforutnately)
<Kammerjunk> http://i.imgur.com/63xvLh.jpg ohgodwhy
<CountDoofus> A gryphon, cool! *is mean to Pinkie* Hmm, that's not nice. *more mean to Pinkie* okay, I'm not sure I like her. *makes Fluttershy cry* :[
<Cypresswolf> I may post an updated photo when all my blind bags and other customs come in
<otakon17> Saturn, Shy is looking for programmers
<Kammerjunk> I approve of your Trixie, Cypresswolf.
<moop> http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000005697557-7e0zj9-crop.jpg?89b97f7

<Jim> The stranger said ponies straight away
<otakon17> Odl
<Saturn> 08,01but i've offered her help and advice
<otakon17> Odl
<Dumori> I haven't talked to her yet cos she was off line
<Dumori> if I'm super lucky it will fall in to my programing experience if not learning is FUN
<mario_pony> oh gos lion king's on.
<otakon17> I found a few potential helpers
<mario_pony> *god
<otakon17> But they need details
<Cypresswolf> Still waiting on a Shadowbolt to come in ^_^ been 6 months waiting, Im told its almost done and will be shipped soon
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: for a moment, i thought that was a duvet
<Saturn> 08,01that would be AWESOME
<Kammerjunk> A Shadowbolt? That's neat.
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Oh, Luna.
<Princess_Luna> Yes?
<Kammerjunk> That's awesome and terrifying at the same time.
<moop> http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/internet-memes-its-a-conspiracy.jpg
<Princess_Luna> Somepony call me?
<otakon17> Only Saturn would want a Molestia duvet
<Dumori> Saturn: I thought the same
<Kammerjunk> Princess_Luna: Pardon. I'm just ponifying everything I can.
<Dumori> I was like man any one with that for their bedding <3
<Dumori> then it wasn't bedding :(
<Kammerjunk> Kind of like "Oh, Goddesses."
<mario_pony> the circle of liiiiiffffeeeee!!!
<Princess_Luna> It's fine, I'm only used to ponies saying oh Celestia...I don't mind though!
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, well, Luna is best princess.
<Kammerjunk> Pip says so himself.
<Dumori> Luna is best god bar Eris
<Dumori> Eris just wins
<Kammerjunk> Do ho ho.
<Kammerjunk> I see what you did there.
<otakon17> Eris in pony form
<otakon17> Now
<mario_pony> and that's why pip was never seen again.
<Saturn> 08,01Luna, you get all my <3
<Saturn> 08,01except the <3 i save specially for Molestia
<Princess_Luna> I'm still best princess ri-oh thank you Satuyrn...
<Dumori> Eris pony is the best pony
<Dumori> I wonder if a discodian brony has done a eris pony
<Cypresswolf> artist of the Screwball custom must have a mold made, there's a new one up already
<CountDoofus> I detest the sun, for it wakes me up during a day off
<fillyfillyy> i share all my <3 equally
<fillyfillyy> except Pinkie Pie get 2x more than all
<Kammerjunk> I give <3 as <3 is to be given.

<Dumori> yes
<Dumori> it's the gender swap rule
<Dumori> Well more "There is always a female version of a male character"
<Cypresswolf> O_o I wonder how I havent gone broke yet. I could have bought a full set of furniture for what I spent on customs since July. Worth it though, fit in quite well with all my anime stuff. :) No one thinks me any weirder
<fillyfillyy> ....exactly how much have you spent on customs?
<Dumori> I don't agree on the eris as discord like but female though
<Cypresswolf> Well, let me put it this way...

<Derpy_Hooves> hai lordcelestia
<MasterBrony> does anypony here live in Boone NC?
<Everlasting_Joy> I won't go into the details just yet, but let's just say something completely unexpected happened, and it was the worst possible thing that could have happened.
<Globetrotter> I've recently had the urge to learn how to play the violin or viola
*LordCelestia 0,5hands Derpy_Hooves a bacon muffin
<Globetrotter> I don't know why.
<Yahooz> wait... is Vis rad radio this week? I cant remember

<MasterBrony> remember:P
<LordCelestia> 0,5I'm sorry to hear that E_J :(
<ScootaChicken> I hope it gets better soon for you :(
<PonyGirl_82> its Mission Impossible MasterBrony just send her a card, if she's worth your attentions she'll appreciate that you thought of her, if she's a gold digger and only wants material things, you just dodged a bullet
<Saturn> 08,01Globetrotter: if you learn the cello, i can give you skype lessons
<Globetrotter> Ooh
*Everlasting_Joy is thankful everyone is so supportive <3.
<Athena> I'm sorry to hear that Everlasting_Joy~
<Globetrotter> Cello is rather large though
*Athena hugs Everlasting_Joy~
<ScootaChicken> Globetrotter: if you learn the guitar, I can give you skype lessons
<ScootaChicken> or the bass
<Globetrotter> I was going for the other two because it;s something I can carry and guitar is too mainstream oh god did I just say that?
<Red_Pegasus> What game is this? DOTA?
<ScootaChicken> Yes you did Globetrotter, and you disgust me.
*Saturn 08,01hugs Everlasting_Joy
<PonyGirl_82> hipster!
<Globetrotter> aaaaaaargh
<Saturn> 08,01Everlasting_Joy: we're all here for you if you need to vent
<Globetrotter> Why me!?
<MasterBrony> my original plan was to send her 2 roses of each color of RD's tail with a note that says "to the girl thats 20% cooler then the rest"
<Saturn> 08,01or just need to get things off your chest
<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn Thank you :).
<MasterBrony> does that sound corny?
*Tarku hugs Everlasting_Joy too
*PonyGirl_82 gives Globetrotter some ironic glasses
<Krakass> Buy them at a local flower shop and send them USPS?
<Wrek> 05is she a brony?

*Globetrotter curb stopms the ironic glasses Pony_Girl82 gave him
<ScootaChicken> oh god it's Valentines day soon
<Saturn> 08,01i hate valentine's day... it's a ridiculous hallmark holiday that's just an excuse to sell more season-appropriate stuff
<MasterBrony> but no place around here or there makes custom bouquets
<ScootaChicken> buck dat shit
<Globetrotter> It's not Saturn
<Saturn> 08,01that said, i've got something planned...
<mario_pony> i don't have school on valentimes day yaay~
<Red_Pegasus> MasterBrony: Then I don't know how I can help.
<Globetrotter> I don't even know what Hallmark is?
<MasterBrony> sigh
<MasterBrony> back to the google
<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn and if you're like me (which has been remedied by ponies), you're reminded of how lonely life can be.
<ScootaChicken> does anyone here want a Valentine's card?

*String_Shredder puts a shot of vodka in Princess_Luna's cider when she isnt looking

<PonyGirl_82> Succubus1982* can't spell my own user name

<Bluestar> moop: Yes. Always.
<Kammerjunk> Wait, little girls watch this show?
<AttackWithHugs> I have to wait another year before I can drink. Legally
*Globetrotter put's ethanol in Princess_Luna's cider
<Kammerjunk> mario_pony: Not over here, it doesn't.
<Princess_Luna> It hasn't affected my judgement much...
<moop> mario_pony: so true
<PonyGirl_82> you're not missing much AttackWithHugs
<Princess_Luna> I will return shortly...though my username will still be here.
<AttackWithHugs> Ah.

<Globetrotter> Likewise AttackWithHugs
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14See you soon Princess_Luna c:
<[SWAG]DisplasedAcorn> neat

<PonyGirl_82> if you go out to drink it bankrupts you and if you stay in to drink you always drink too much
<AttackWithHugs> Globetrotter: I'm 20
<mario_pony> Kammerjunk: law breaker!!!!!!!
<Bluestar> Ten points to Athena!
<Kammerjunk> mario_pony: Not in Denmark.

<mario_pony> PonyGirl_82: wwwwhhhhhhaaaaaaaatttt!!!???
*Athena hugs Roxsnow back~
<MasterBrony> Princess Luna was here
<MasterBrony> ????
<moop> beer tastes like shit
<AttackWithHugs> Globetrotter: Lucky you
<MasterBrony> WHERES MAI WAIFU!!??
<DashWithRainbows> moop I agree.
<Bluestar> I don't know what either taste like.
<Globetrotter> AttackWithHugs Yeah. Totally.
<Krakass> Only shitty beer tastes like shit.Good beer tastes like beer.
<Globetrotter> Let's go with that.
<MasterBrony> i like beer
<MasterBrony> german dark beer is best
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14^
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14Though I prefer wein .-.
<mario_pony> a bunch of people in my school drink and do drugs an d smoke i just think their a bunch of dumbasses
<Krakass> Coors Light is best beer.
<MasterBrony> mead is good
<moop> also im never ever ever ever ever gonna smoke cigarretes again
<Krakass> ;-)
<MasterBrony> and i like coors light
*Roxsnow prefers wine >w>....
*AttackWithHugs has coocokes
<AttackWithHugs> cookies*
*Globetrotter prefers vodka mixers cos he's apparently badass
<Red_Pegasus> I don't drink :)
<Globetrotter> ..
<Kammerjunk> mario_pony: Quite.
<moop> mario_pony: u are judging them
<Kammerjunk> Losers don't do drugs.
<Bluestar> moop: Good for you! I've lost more friends to cigarettes than I have pennies to vacuums.
*Roxsnow gets really drunk with wine REALLY easily =w=;;;
<MasterBrony> tequila is my fav liquor
<mario_pony> it's funny my cousin did drugs now his mom loves me more than him.
<MirrorImage> moop - it's not entirely unjustified
<Kammerjunk> I kind of like vodka.
<Wrek> 05goan grab dinner brb
<Kammerjunk> Vodka is best liquor.
<moop> Well every one judges people puts them into stupid catgoriesWe all do and its natural ... but its not right
<Globetrotter> Krupnik
<Globetrotter> Try that.
<Yahooz> I dont really have a critical taste for liquor. I just drink it XD
<MirrorImage> moop - it depends on whether the category is a justified one
<Kammerjunk> moop: Vodka is best liquor because it's used to make Taste the Rainbow.
<Globetrotter> http://tinyurl.com/7alj6ys
<MirrorImage> i don't have full context on what's going on, but what i see is a bunch of high schoolers are smoking and drinking
<Yahooz> Vodka Skittles?
<Yahooz> Yes please
<moop> Kammerjunk: what is justified?
<MirrorImage> what that tells me is they have little respect for the laws (smoking until 18; drinking until 21, etc)
<Bluestar> To judge is natural. To act indifferential to how you've judged another is righteous.
<Globetrotter> Drinking is 18 over here MirrorImage
<Kammerjunk> moop: I don't know, what did I say? I can't remember.
<Kammerjunk> Globetrotter: Ha! 16 or something here.
<MirrorImage> Globetrotter - and here it's 21, but i'm still talking about high schoolers
<Kammerjunk> I honestly don't know the exact age.
<RAWRity> I will say this: Farenheit makes more sense for day to day temperatures than Celsius
<Globetrotter> I don't know what a high schooler is
<Globetrotter> You have a different school system
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14-10c here. . .
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14.-.
<Yahooz> thats pretty cold :p
<MasterBrony> does anypony here work for the military?
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14feels cold mann. .
<DerpyHooves`> 08,14;A;
<MirrorImage> high school here is equivalent of years 9-12
<MasterBrony> i have a question for them if they do
<Frank> Evening everypony
<Bluestar> DepyHooves`: Laugh through the cold!
<Yahooz> heya Frank
<MasterBrony> evening'
<AttackWithHugs> evening, Frank
<Bluestar> Evening Frank!
<Frank> :D
<Red_Pegasus> Hello, the man who stopped wars.
<Globetrotter> Ahh, so I would be in the last year of high school then MirrorImage year 12? First year of 6th form over here.
<PonyGirl_82> I've been the cycle for liquor, cocktails of all flavours and contents, wines, beers, ales, liqueurs, sometimes even neat liquor. Nowadays though I can't stomach much more than a glass of wine
<Tarku> -2 `C here :{)
<Yahooz> Its been the warmest winter here... 50 F average per day 0_0
<Kammerjunk> It's 4C here. Personally, I think anything below 13C is cold.
<MirrorImage> year/grade 12 here is the last year of public school
<Jim> MasterBrony: I will be conscripted into the army this autumn
<Kammerjunk> I'm not a cold person, as you might see.
<MasterBrony> ok

<MasterBrony> i would have the power to become an Alicorn
<Princess_Luna> Any superpower...the ones that I have.
<MasterBrony> and my name would be Brony-man
<Globetrotter> To be able to transform into any animal or object mario_pony
<flutter_spin> hmm. ok. I guess that makes sense.
<AttackWithHugs> I would shapeshift into Pinkie Pie

<Globetrotter> The amount of teasing you get from that names is ridiculous over here.

<MasterBrony> so
*Globetrotter scampers
<Jim> That's so cool :)
<moop> AttackWihtHugs: No its a tire
<Roxsnow> Nice alliteration Athena : 3
<MasterBrony> the radioation from nuclear war turns us all into ponies?!?!?!
<Princess_Luna> ((mario_pony, you are stuck on the ceiling with reverse polarity. Leave the building and you will fly into the sun))
<mario_pony> my sister is listening to sexy and i know it.
<MasterBrony> FIRE THE MISSLES!!!!
<Athena> Thanks~
<AttackWithHugs> Athena, moop: A tire in Equestria? WITCHCRAFT!
<Everlasting_Joy> I'm back.
<String_Shredder> mario_pony: im listening to die die my darling the metallica version
<Jim> ohai Everlasting_Joy
<Princess_Luna> moop: That could be a wheel to a carriage.
<mario_pony> girl look at that body girl look at that body i work out
<Everlasting_Joy> Hi Jim!
<Roxsnow> welcome back Everlasting_Joy : 3
<AttackWithHugs> Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle wiggle wiggle, yeah!
<Athena> I think equestria is what would happen if you turned on the GECK in fallout 3~
<moop> Princess_Luna: i think it's way to thick
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy Roxsnow.
<String_Shredder> oh and mario_pony: WIGGLE WIGGLE WIGGLE WI- damnit AttackWithHugs
<mario_pony> when i walk on by girls be looking like damn he fly!@
<Princess_Luna> I know it sort of looks like a tire...but Earth is in a seperate dimension.
<MasterBrony> im telling you its the radiation from nuclear fallout....FIRE TEH MISSLES!!!
<MasterBrony> we turn into ponies from the radioation
<Everlasting_Joy> MasterBrony now now, first have a nap.
<AttackWithHugs> String_Shredder: I see the video everytime I sing it.
<MasterBrony> why do i need a nap?!?
<Athena> Mutations + GECK = Ponies~ I think
<flutter_spin> Any pony played Bastion?
<mario_pony> me too
<MasterBrony> we have missles ot launch!!!
<moop> Princess_Luna: how can it be? They have only one sun. They Have very similar thecnological advances
<Bluestar> Ooh, this pony loves Bastion, flutter_spin.
<MirrorImage> just because they have a tire doesn't mean that it's Earth
<flutter_spin> I've been contemplating in getting it. Not sure if its worth my money
<MirrorImage> it just means they've discovered vulcanized rubber
<moop> Princess_Luna: a similar atmosphere
<Princess_Luna> moop: I...don't question further...
<MirrorImage> the implication is no different than another alien culture discovering that pure oxygen is flammable
<Globetrotter> You know, they could have tires for their carriages.
<mario_pony> this shit is bananas b ana na
<MasterBrony> help me launch the nukes......WE NEED TO BECOME PONIES!!!
<Globetrotter> They DO have trains you know.
<Princess_Luna> I like trains...
*String_Shredder trots up to MasterBrony "buit i already am a pony
<flutter_spin> http://yudhaikeledai.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-Sparkle-and-Starcraft-Ghost-Unit-Portrait-275761185 Twilight can help you with that
<Bluestar> If you like smooth and reliable gameplay, beautiful environments, enthralling narrative and strong-silent-type MCs, Bastion is a great game to pick up.
<AttackWithHugs> But the trains are pulld by ponies, mostly
*Athena presses the huge red button right next to the coffee machine button "ops"
<Athena> Oops*

<Princess_Luna> ...good idea.
<Ingwaz> Tarku: how would a comma have changed the meaning of "i hate that for you then" at all?
<MasterBrony> im an ALICORN FOAL!!!
*Princess_Luna petrifies MasterBrony as a foal
<Princess_Luna> No you aren't
*Globetrotter "Pray tell, is MasterBrony an alicorn or merely a gifted unicorn?"
<TheMonstaMuffin> is nothing on:(?
*MasterBrony unpetrifies himself
<Princess_Luna> Now you are petrified though...
<Tarku> Ingwaz: "I hate that for you, then" would be proper
<MasterBrony> im an ALICORN
*Globetrotter aliSLAP
<Roxsnow> Its always the Alicorns huh : /
<Princess_Luna> *petrifies and puts him in Celestia's room*
*TOY_PON3 snickers
<Scavender> Well, a nice stature never hurts...
<Derpy_Hooves> you know what sounds fun?
<Tarku> oh dear....
<Derpy_Hooves> playing gothem city imposters
*MasterBrony unpetrifies himself and sstart crying.....
<Princess_Luna> What Derpy?
<TOY_PON3> Roxsnow: I'm no Alicorn I'm a talented unicorn :3
<Roxsnow> amazing TOY_PON3 : 3
<Ingwaz> Tarku: i disagree, a comma denotes a slight pause in the speech. The phrase I typed needs no pause and is meant to not have one. It would however, have been proper to include the comma had the statement continued on after that to include something else
<Athena> My oc~: http://imgur.com/NLpdw

<Princess_Luna> I guess...
<Jim> That's a cool OC
<Athena> Thank you~
<TOY_PON3> Mine is just simple, but it still works :)
*TOY_PON3 squees
<Princess_Luna> Alicorn OCs are not generally accepted, but as long as she doesn't act like a Sue, I'm fine...
<Roxsnow> Simplicity is sometimes best ya know TOY_PON3 =w=

<flutter_spin> I don't like the joke. I didn't like it in the game and it wasn't funny after I heard it the second time
<ScootaChicken> arrow in the knee jokes were never funny
<Aircrafter> I had no idea what the arrow to the knee jokes were about until I actually heard a guard say it XD
<Globetrotter> I only heard it once in-game
<Athena> I agree with ScootaChicken~
<moop> I USED TO NOT CAR FOR THEM..... THEN I TOOK AN ARROW TO THE KNEE!
<ScootaChicken> making fun of arrow in the knee jokes was only slightly more funny
<flutter_spin> I heard it everywhere.
<Rainbowjack> Then i got a RAINBOW to the knee
<Athena> I didn't car about anything, but I cared about it~
<moop> CARE
<Aircrafter> I used too hate My little pony, But then I got a season one too the brain.

<KiDtehEPiC> this conversation needs more ponies... *puts on pokemon hat* Thaats better!
<flutter_spin> Then rewatched the whole thing in a week
<ScootaChicken> where is SaxyPretender...
<flutter_spin> Started following the series after that
<flutter_spin> Found out about bronies from the Learn about Meme video
*MasterBrony feels ignored and leaves the chat to go do other pony things
<Athena> The reason I dislike it is that my firend made the worst joke, *guy just got out of the hospitol with a broken knee* Friend: I used to be able to walk... then I broke my knee. *punch*
<ScootaChicken> Vi radio isn't the same without Saxy's presence ;____;
<mario_pony> my eyes hurt
<flutter_spin> And... everything followed after that
*Globetrotter "I had been told that it lived nearby to a lake. Lake unguwandura to be precise"

<KiDtehEPiC> Fucking... GENIUS
*Globetrotter " Lake unguwandura was massive, many miles in circumference"
<flutter_spin> Ranma was weird. It started off interesting and then just got nutty later on. I stopped who knows when.
<Athena> Wait.. New pony toys? HUZZAH!
*Globetrotter "But the surface was flat, reflective like a mirror, reflecting the place blue sky"
<flutter_spin> I think it had to be the grandpa. Ruined it
<KiDtehEPiC> The last episode.
<unfoundbug> i really hope that new set makes its way to the uk
*Globetrotter "It was quite hypnotic really"
<KiDtehEPiC> Atleast watch that.

<Aircrafter> Ewwwww.....
<NewDCD> 09,01I don't. I don't really feel comftable with being a pony. I like picturing myself as a human...it's my pride in my species.
<Jim> I mean STEAM, not stream
<otakon> lol
<DWR_Drawing> Scoot-Scootaloo Same here...

<SaxyPretender> 0,14...Saturn confirmed for having a beard to rival otakon's
<NewDCD> 09,01I have a provisional ponysona but I don't like whipping it out. Mainly because of what I said earlier. And maybe also because I don't like being associated with a pony...I'd rather be associated with myself.
<otakon> um
<Saturn> 08,01<3
*MasterBrony is a grown alicorn again
<DWR_Drawing> Beard off?
<Aircrafter> .....It'd be like 1,000 pinkie pies singing at once...

<ScootaChicken> mind you, my hair is completely black

<NewDCD> 09,01myself included
<ScootaChicken> getting it pink would be rather difficult
<otakon> ScootaChicken: you'd look ridiculous

<ScootaChicken> otakon: nope. I'd look epic.

<Princess_Luna> I like trains...
<NewDCD> 09,01thing is, a project like that should be discussed with the art department, mayhaps
<arrowtobroknee> *hit by train*
<NewDCD> 09,01as well as the administrators, because it constitutes a partnership.
