<Spy> .....
<AgentKalim> Bye, MegaMoonShine
<Om> MahBoi777: Have the funs!
<LochNessCheez> this show's cool
<ACS13123> Dat missile was fired by a Spy !

<Ninjazz|Observant> Back btw.
<Reikim|Spy> Bye MahBoi777
<Spy> what movie is this??
<LochNessCheez> FATALLITY
<bloodybrony> wait isnt like half of japan covered in radiation
<alexxm> what show is this
<Om> Ninjazz|Observant: Waaaaaaat!?
<pony_9996> The internet?
<Rex_Mundi> I used to be a adventurer like you, I used to wonder what Friendship could be, but then I took a Fluttershy to the heart.
<twilight_sprinkle> bloodybrony: they werent nukes obviously
*MahBoi777 hugs AgentKalim, Lil_B, Ponies47, alexxm, Om, Ninjazz|Observant, Reikim|Spy, and Starflash
<Reikim|Spy> bloodybrony: Yes. It's called UV radiation. It comes from the sun.
<Lil_B> 4chan and reddid was all over it
<Ninjazz|Observant> Om: Hmmm?
<AgentKalim> ^_^
<AgentKalim> Next stop: YOUR DOOM
<bloodybrony> lol i supose that answers my question XD
<Om> Ninjazz|Observant: eat some toast.
<Rex_Mundi> Seriously though, I think ive fallen in love with Fluttershy, shes my current pony crush.
<Spy> what movie is this??
<Ninjazz|Observant> Om: I have tea. :S
<ACS13123> Dat writing
<Vordox> DOSE SUBS
<diddutz> fail subs
<Om> Ninjazz|Observant: So close.
<Nyria> x3
<diddutz> that was too easy
<alexxm> well this kid is evil
<Ninjazz|Observant> :(
<AgentKalim> TIGHT security
<Reikim|Spy> Strange. Fluttershy, Twilight and sometimes Rarity are the ones most susceptible to pony-crushes. Dash gets a few, Applejack gets none at all, and Pinkie...well, most people treat Pinkie as a hyperactive younger sibling.
<Spy> i feel like derpy hooves
<Derpy_Hooves> :3
<Panda> Nyria may i pm you?
<Nyria> Panda: Of course ^^
<ACS13123> Spy: you mean you feel like Derpy_Hooves?
<Om> Panda: I smell the fur of a Panda man!
<Rex_Mundi> Reikim|Spy A while back my pony crush was Celestia
<Panda> Om xD whats up
<Reikim|Spy> Rex_Mundi: That's quite unique. Never heard that one before, though Luna is also popular.
<bloodybrony> hey i have a crush on pinkie
<Lil_B> the missles were fired by the united Mothers of the World in an attempt to make Japan less wierd
<Spy> no, i feel ingored and forgotten....
<bloodybrony> shes so happy
<Chrysalis> poor applejack
<bloodybrony> i wana wife like that
<Reikim|Spy> Lil_B: And they failed.
<Derpy_Hooves> D:
*AgentKalim gives some love to Spy
<Om> Panda: Nothing much. Layin on my couch, wathing a socialy awkward japanese
<Ponies47> If you don't like Luna and/or Derpy your not a true brony O_O
<bloodybrony> ya i like boath
<Panda> Om haha well im just drawing ^-^
<Lil_B> Reikim|Spy Mothers tend to make bad decitions that lead to nowhere
<LochNessCheez> BBBFF in law?
<Om> Panda: Fun stufs!
<Reikim|Spy> Oh, wait, am I still a spy?
*Reikim|Spy de-spies
<AgentKalim> BBBFF in law
<Panda> Om hehe kinda...
<Ponies47> My brother is not my BBBFF :|
<Reikim> Better.
<Om> Panda: Not so much?
<Lil_B> BBLBFF
<LochNessCheez> BBiLBFF
<Rex_Mundi> Reikim|Spy- Celestia is pretty, and powerful, with a great voice
<Lil_B> LochNessCheez that was my first thought XD
<LochNessCheez> celestia can lift up the frigging SUN
<flutter_spin> whoa!
<flutter_spin> its white!
<Panda> Om haha wish it wasnt as suggestive of a request xD it makes wrekys stuff look tame xD
<Spy> what?
<Om> Panda: Ahh. That kind of drawing :D
<AgentKalim> Well, I don't think she physically LIFTS it
<Lil_B> MLP Blindbag?
<LochNessCheez> where did he get the drink
<alexxm> hey guys
<ACS13123> Goodbye :'(
<Panda> Om yeah... my first one xD i mean i did draw some sugestive pony stuff... but never posted
<Ninjazz> Hello there, alexxm.
<Vordox> ROOOMAAAAAAAAAAAAANCCEEEEEEEEEE
<Panda> Ninjazz :)
<flutter_spin> I can't believe "Brave" was such a letdown for me
<Spy> waitwhat...pony crushes? :D
<twilight_sprinkle> and then she fell
<Rex_Mundi> Reading Maxiburgers blog, the page about "the stair" master, it seems the Japanese really like Fluttershy a lot too (and thats no surprise)
<Om> Panda: Yeah. I would belive that.
<Ninjazz> Panda :3
<LochNessCheez> and then he pushed her off
<Reikim> I heard romance?
<Vordox> Rex_Mundi: You mean Tsundere? Or Yandere?
<Spy> that was a joke, right?
<Panda> Om haha why you put it that way? They were all requests xD
<LochNessCheez> I just realised
<bloodybrony> twilight_sparkle i was just about to say that, they boath fell and then the boat leaft without them
<Alchemist> derpiboo.ru is full of hardcore nsfw stuff... I dont mind suggestive, but those are over the top for me.
<Panda> Ninjazz ^-^
<AgentKalim> You can always put on a filter on derpiboo.ru
<flutter_spin> Its the Internet.
<Om> Panda: I'm sure *all* of them were :)
<alexxm> hey Ninjazz hows your day been
<flutter_spin> And yeah, there is a filter... right?
<Alchemist> AgentKalim: I know, and now I do :)
<Ninjazz> alexxm: Good.
<Lil_B> This guy looks so slimy
<LochNessCheez> the guy was like: Whoa! this guy has the same phone as I do, this means that he must have lost his memory too!
<Spy> seriously, pony-crushes, this is a joke, right?
<Panda> Om no they really were... i dont have that good of an imagination
<diddutz> lion king :3
<Om> Panda: Don't sell yourself short mang
<AgentKalim> Look boi, Central park
<Ninjazz> Spy: You haven't been here long, have you?
<flutter_spin> ha! $700? I didn't think her car cost her that much to fix
<Rex_Mundi> Vordox- The words "too cute" and "moe" were used. And one guy said he wanted to marry Fluttershy
<Spy> no...
<Panda> Om im not D:
<alexxm> does the stream keep buffering for anyone else
<Spy> but how did you know?
<Vordox> alexxm: It's "Stuttering"
<Ninjazz> Spy: I can tell.
<flutter_spin> Actually, the stream is giving me a "this website is offline" message now
<Om> Panda: Okay oookay. Just draw happily:D
<flutter_spin> Which is weird, but I am getting some white backdrop on the chat
<flutter_spin> So... maybe its just me
<bloodybrony> WAIT HOW NEW IS THIS MOVIE
<AgentKalim> Ohboy 9/11
<alexxm> flutter_spin yeah i just got that
<twilight_sprinkle> alexxm: a bit laggy for me but no buffering
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Now that's not mormal.
<Reikim> *normal
<Ninjazz> They refed 9/11, oh mah gawd. D:
<Rex_Mundi> Spy- loads of people get pony crushes, its normal
<LochNessCheez> 9/11 bring your plane to work day
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs flutter_spin
<derpy_pony> you guys have a stream?
<Panda> Om ill try xD its not exactly my niche
<bloodybrony> i still like pinkie pie or twilight
<AgentKalim> Cmere, cupcake
<Vordox> THIS IS TOO AIRHEADED PEOPLE FOR MEEEEEEEEEEEEeee. ._.
<derpy_pony> I only get "this website is offline"
*Spy laughs so much he falls of his chair
<Reikim> Ah, I see it's been long enough that we can make dark jokes about 9/11 now.
<AgentKalim> Ground zero. How romantic.
<flutter_spin> woot! Nit hugged me
*flutter_spin hugs Nittany_Discord
<Om> Panda: One reason I don't really take requests, among other reasons.
<alexxm> any ideas why you're getting that flutter_spin
<Spy> it doesnt really sound normal :D
<Dark_Horst> sooooo... what'S this show actually about?
*ACS13123 hugs Nittany_Discord "Hug me goddammit"
<derpy_pony> oh...now
<Panda> Om hehe i dont mind, it actually broadens my drawing style

<Lil_B> AgentKalim: np :D
<Ninjazz> My vote.
<Vordox> Saturn: Elfen Lied is banned from BrS, remember that
<Saturn> 08,01oooo
<Saturn> 08,01misfits
<LochNessCheez> type 1 if you vote for elfen lied
<LochNessCheez> of is it?
<Reikim> Saturn: Code Geass is good. Elfen Lied...are you even allowed to stream that at this time of day?
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: really? since when?
<shana> I vote for eden of east :)
*flutter_spin kicks router
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: i'll need to check up on that
<Vordox> Saturn: It's too graphical for BrS, has been discussed with the other mods.
<flutter_spin> "What you do this time?"
<Dark_Horst> Saturn: i remember others didnt want to play it because its so splattery
<LochNessCheez> elfen lied, and if not then eden of the east
<Panda> Saturn, may i speak with you for a second?
<Rex_Mundi> Spy- Trust me, people get crushes on fictional characters all the time, pony crushes just happen, and then dissapear after a short time.
<alexxm> how come Vordox
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Elfen Lied has too much nudity to be shown on here with a normal stream.
<Vordox> alexxm: It's too graphical
<Reikim> I thought so.
<Ninjazz> Hmmm.
<LochNessCheez> meh
<flutter_spin> Ghost in the Shell. There. That's all I need.
<Reikim> Elfen Lied is too graphic.
*Spy has trouble, he cant stop laughing
<shana> Saturn: could you try enabling framedropping? may make it more bearable..
<Saturn> 08,01Panda: of course
<Vordox> Saturn: There's stuttering ALOT of it.
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: that bad, huh
<Saturn> 08,01shana: nah, it's because my harddrive is failing
<flutter_spin> sluttering?
<Saturn> 08,01it keeps getting read errors
<Reikim> So yeah, my vote's for Code Geass, just because it's fun to see the Lancelot tearing through mooks.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I love Elfen Lied though.
<flutter_spin> :P
<Midnight_Splendor> Wasn't the first 5 min of elfen lied rated the most violent intro in anime history.
<alexxm> is this a amv or the opening
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: same.
<Vordox> Midnight_Splendor: No, not even close.
<shana> Saturn: ooh thought it was slow cpu..
<Saturn> 08,01that should be a bit better now
<TrixieBaconMuffin> MLP has more nudity than a porno! think about that ^^
<flutter_spin> whooooa
<Vordox> Saturn: Will report.
<Saturn> 08,01shana: heh, quad core i7 :P
<flutter_spin> ok, I have stream now.
<LochNessCheez> true dat
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01MLP is reverse porn.
<flutter_spin> Eden of the East?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01More clothes are sexier.
<Ninjazz> Indeed.
<Vordox> Saturn: Still stuttering. It's more often but it doesn't lag.
<Ninjazz> Socks~
<MadSurge> TrixieBaconMuffin: SFW nudity even :D
<LochNessCheez> huh
<derpy_pony> it's all about nekkid ponies
<AgentKalim> Nittany_Discord: That suddenly makes perfect sense
<PartyCannon> Nittany_Discord best irony ever
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: Theiss Titillation Theory.
<Alister[S]> Hello Everypony !
<LochNessCheez> suddenly it says this website is online
<MadSurge> Nittany_Discord: Ikr, it's like a paradox
<Chrysalis> Nittany_Discord so THATS why socks are so risque
<Reikim> So anyway, what did we end up watching?
<Saturn> 08,01how's it now?
<Alister[S]> Hello !
<flutter_spin> oh come now, we all knew that Nittany_Discord ... right?
<LochNessCheez> ok there
<alexxm> hey Alister[S] hows your day been
<Vordox> What are you talking about? a womne who can WEAR CLOTHES > A woman who cannot wear clothes.
<MadSurge> Alister[S]: hello :)
<Reikim> Hey Alister[S]
<flutter_spin> No errors, Saturn. Stream is active for me.
<Om> Ninjazz: You and your socks.
<Spy> since when did ponies normaly use clothes -__-
<Ponies47> Hey Alister[S] :)
<Ninjazz> Vordox: Ponies.
<Reikim> What is this
<Alister[S]> alexxm: Just oj
<Lil_B> TrixieBaconMuffin Ponyville is a nudist colony, look Canterlot and Appleooza, they all wear something
<Vordox> Ninjazz: It's true for humans too.
<Reikim> ?
<Ninjazz> Om: I know right?
<Vordox> Saturn: HUUUUUGE audio delay
<Ninjazz> Vordox: We aren't talking about silly humans.
<flutter_spin> whoa
<Reikim> Ah, more Eden of the East
<flutter_spin> yeah, ditto here Vordox
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: 2 secs, i'll fix that
<Vordox> Saturn: The stuttering stopped the frames, and the sound continued while it was stuttering with catchin gup
<flutter_spin> So what is this anime about?
<Vordox> Ninjazz: I'm talking about ANYTHING :P
<LochNessCheez> some guy who forgot everything
<Saturn> 08,01how's it now?
<Vordox> Ninjazz: Check nature for god sake, more clothes has ALWAYS been sexier, no matter what.
<Chrysalis> http://th05.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2012/103/a/c/luna__socks__by_lerauxart-d4w1jp6.png > http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/017/b/f/luna_by_up1ter-d4mo3ax.png
<Vordox> Saturn: It's catchin gup
<flutter_spin> still adjusting Saturn.
<LochNessCheez> and apparently is a nigerian prince! he's got 8 billion in his bank account
<shana> flutter_spin: do you want a recap on what happened?
<Vordox> Saturn: The sound is skipping frames to catch up with the visuals
<Chrysalis> LochNessCheez how many details does he need?
<LochNessCheez> ALL OF THEM
<Vordox> Saturn: Now the audio is WAY ahead of the ideo XD
<flutter_spin> I'm still unsure if I want to see it shana . More wanting of a synopsis of the series
<GilDash> LochNessCheez: Seems legit.
<Reikim> If anyone needs a recap, this: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast?from=Main.EdenOfTheEast Should just about cover everything you need to know.
<LochNessCheez> bang
<Lil_B> cat?
<Lil_B> oh
<Om> GilDash: How was your dinner?
<Vordox> Now the audio is WAY behind again. XD Lol at this
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> morning everyone :)
<Shizuka> 13http://i.imgur.com/ELsdH.jpg I KNEW IT
<GilDash> Om: It was nice. I'm stuffed. :)
<Saturn> 08,01how about now?
<Reikim> Morning Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Lil_B> hi Darkts3|Drawing|MLG
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Shizuka: Lol
<Vordox> Shizuka: LAWL Pyro
<Panda> Shizuka xD
<Reikim> Shizuka: :D
<shana> its missile!
<Ninjazz> Shizuka: Of course... It all makes sense now.
<Reikim> Shizuka: So I guess that was the Meet the Pyro video then?
<Sundaysmile> What's this anime about?
<Vordox> The frames are skipping and leaving the audio behind again
<Om> GilDash: You are always stuffed in my opinion.
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Project P-100 reminds me of Pikmin but with better combat :D
<Panda> Wait.... Shizuka is a EQUALIST?????
<Rex_Mundi> Spy- just you wait, it will likely happen to you
<Lil_B> hi GilDash :)
<GilDash> Om: ... ;)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Panda: probably
<GilDash> Lil_B: Holla! :)
<flutter_spin> Ok, that trope page just confused me more
<Freefall29> hey guys
<LochNessCheez> hello Freefall29
<Reikim> flutter_spin: Dunno how that happened, but hey, it's that kind of series.
<Vordox> Saturn: Audio way behind and MASSIVE stuttering on the visuals. Whatever you did made it way worse.
<alexxm> hey Darkts3|Drawing|MLG you sleep well
<Vordox> Saturn: Might as well go back to watchable like previous episodes.
<Freefall29> say. what show is this?
<alexxm> hey Freefall29 hows your day been
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> alexxm: i guess
<Spy> what will happen to me? (sorry is was on another site and didnt really follow the chat)
<Lil_B> MadSurge i never played Pikmin, but i like the concept of this game :)
<LochNessCheez> eden of the something
<flutter_spin> So its a realist.. fantasy.. world war type of thing?
<Vordox> WAIT
<LochNessCheez> or something
<Vordox> Now it's fixed!
<Rex_Mundi> Spy- Pony crush
<Vordox> Saturn: It's fixed!
<GilDash> Saturn: What have you done? It was absolutely fine a half hour ago. :S
<MadSurge> Lil_B: me likes too :)
<Freefall29> alexxm: my day's been average. I've had more boring days before
<Om> GilDash: Yes yes Rarity winky face, its like your calling card or something
<flutter_spin> dat reference
<GilDash> Om: Gotta have something to make me identifiable. :)
<Freefall29> say... what is the name of this show?
<Everlasting_Joy> Howdy y'all!

<flutter_spin> "Eden of the East"

<flutter_spin> right?
<Om> Panda: Yup.
<GilDash> Everlasting_Joy: Holla! :)
*Bronysith glomps Everlasting_Joy
<Ninjazz> Panda: It's only like that if you think like that.
<Ponies47> Hey Everlasting_Joy :)
<alexxm> hey Everlasting_Joy hows your day been
<Om> Lil_B: No. No it isnt
<shana> Saturn: hmm do you have ass subtitles enabled in mplayer?
<MadSurge> Shizuka: thank god for the Pyro joke, I want to watch that series but not be spoiled too much :D
<GilDash> Panda, Om, Ninjazz: I'd never lay a hoof on a lady without her permission.
*Everlasting_Joy is glomped.
<flutter_spin> I was hoping for robots, for some reason
<Reikim> MadSurge: Watch it. Watch it NAO. And don't stop until you're caught up.
<Bronysith> HIYA everypony
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I've been informed of your rules. I know.
<Panda> GilDash you better not defile my rarity ^-^
<Everlasting_Joy> alexxm: Pretty decent. Got a few updates to some sites I run, so it's not a complete waste :).
<Freefall29> hey Bronysith
<Ninjazz> Panda: What do you mean "My"
<AgentKalim> Hi, Bronysith
<Midnight_Splendor> Cute dog
<shana> Saturn: (maybe try -ass next time..)
*Ponies47 Gives everypony a chicken
<Vordox> Saturn: It's synched. :) The visuals stutters but the sound is not desynching.
<flutter_spin> coooooool
<alexxm> Everlasting_Joy what websites do you run
<Om> GilDash: But you would never try to lead her to give you permision either right?
<Panda> Ninjazz hm? Shes mine... no?
*Freefall29 glomps Bronysith
<flutter_spin> I so want that room
<LochNessCheez> ponies don't eat chicken
<Rex_Mundi> I cant be the only one here in love with Fluttershy...
*LochNessCheez refuses chicken
<alexxm> hey Bronysith hows your day been
<MadSurge> Reikim: I was tinking of finally getting that YT downloader program and get the episodes like that :D
<Vordox> Saturn: The stuttering is watchable, so no need for futher adjusting.
*Bronysith dodges Freefall29 s pathetic attempt of a glomp
<Everlasting_Joy> alexxm: It would be the Twitter and Facebook pages to my talk show.
<MadSurge> Rex_Mundi: Fluttershy is <3
<flutter_spin> LOL
*Freefall29 is sad. :'(
<GilDash> Om: Hey, can't blame a guy for trying. If no one ever tried, no one would ever get anywhere.
<flutter_spin> Smart dog.
<Reikim> MadSurge: Nonono, you just stream it off of watchcartoononline. If you can watch the stream without lag, you can stream it right off of there.
<Ninjazz> Panda: No. You belong to Rarity. Not the other way around. Just like me. Just like everypony.
<Spy> i dont think that will happen to me, it sounds to weird
<AgentKalim> Lololol, more ground zero
<Om> GilDash: I'm fine with that, at times.
*Ponies47 Hugs Freefall29
<Ponies47> Freefall29: Why?
<Vordox> What's with the music in this anime...it's hurting my brain...
<Panda> Ninjazz im... im... a slave???
<flutter_spin> her eyes are... creepy
<GilDash> Om: I'll keep that in mind. ;)
<Ninjazz> Panda: To a goddess. ;)
<pony-pokey> localiation :D
<Reikim> Ninjazz: Fool! I belong to no mare! Especially not Rarity!
<Lil_B> is there actuall a ground one anywhere? or two?
<MadSurge> Reikim: :O will do, sir/ma'am!
*alexxm hugs Freefall29 whats the matter
<Om> I fear I have made a mistake.
<Ninjazz> Reikim: You've never been given the choice.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> now hold on there Ninjazz , I belong to Luna and noponyelse
<Panda> Ninjazz hm... :) me gusta
<flutter_spin> oh no. Amnesia? ugh.
<Freefall29> well Ninjazz... I tried to glomp Bronysith and I missed. for that I am sad.
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Luna approves of it, though. :<
<Panda> Om mistake?
<Reikim> Ninjazz: I reject this reality and substitute my own! You now belong to Fluttershy.
<flutter_spin> cool phone.
<Ninjazz> Reikim: Rejected. Rarity overrules.
<Om> Panda: Yes...
<Panda> Reikim wait... we belong to fshy now? O_o
<Ninjazz> Freefall29: Try one more time.
<flutter_spin> BOOOM
<flutter_spin> what, no boom?
<Panda> Ninjazz xD
*Freefall29 glomps Bronysith
<Reikim> Ninjazz: Countered: Fluttershy could totally beat Rarity in a fight.
<Everlasting_Joy> What are we watching?
<alexxm> what
*Bronysith dodges Freefall29 again
<Ninjazz> Reikim: Yeah... no.
<flutter_spin> flip a switch. There has to be an explosion
<Freefall29> well I tried
<Reikim> Ninjazz: You have no idea.
<Bronysith> hey Reikim whatsaup? pierced the heavens lately?
<twilight_sprinkle> Ninjazz: ha, you triggered my trap card. Now we all eblong to Twilight
*Lil_B hugs Bronysith ;)
<AgentKalim> Reikim: We can solve that ourselves once Fighting is Magic comes out.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Ninjazz: Luna is Princess of the night and overrules anything you say
<Freefall29> AgentKalim: when does it come out anyways?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> :P
<Reikim> AgentKalim: Suggeston taken. Ninjazz, as soon as Fighting is Magic comes out, we are settling this.
<Spy> Rex_Mundi, i dont think so, it is 1000000 times to wierd
<Panda> Reikim OBJECTION! Fluttershy may have her rage on her side but Rarity has powerful magic.
<Spy> *weird
<flutter_spin> ppfft
<Ninjazz> Reikim: I don't play fighting games.
<AgentKalim> I'm not sure, somewhere later this year?
<Rex_Mundi> MadSurge- aint she the greatest. Everyones heart belongs to Fluttershy
<flutter_spin> You know how many people use their phone during a movie?
<Reikim> Panda: What powerful magic? Finding gemstones and light telekinesis. Yeah.
<Bronysith> http://i.imgur.com/HLQlh.jpg
<Panda> Reikim have you seen how op fshy is in FIM
<Reikim> Ninjazz: :'(
<Everlasting_Joy> flutter_spin: a lot?
<flutter_spin> she's cute.
*Ninjazz sighs "Blind fools. Once Queen Rarity establishes her throne... You'll all see" >:3
<Reikim> Panda: She needs a nerf, yeah.
<Reikim> Panda: Actually Pinkie Pie is far more broken.
<Freefall29> I just hope fighting is magic is balanced.... as in the mane 6 are given the most powerful moves
<Freefall29> arnt
<Panda> Reikim telekenisis is what jedi have... fshy is f(squee)d
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Please, Spitfire's got my number first. ;)
<flutter_spin> yeah, like a lot...
<hen3ry> yeah, um... Pinkie Pie is second strongest sorceress.
<hen3ry> possibly first
<Panda> Reikim how is pink more broken? Fshy just stare kills everyone
<MadSurge> Ninjazz: a classier world for a classier princess! :D
<Everlasting_Joy> flutter_spin: This is of course assuming the theater doesn't have jammers installed.
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz, do you ponycrush on Rarity?
<Bronysith> http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/348/1/f/dan_vs_original_characters_by_mixermike622-d4j2jzy.png

<Spy> seriously! stop talking about these "pony crushes" im laughing my head of!
<flutter_spin> they have jammers?
<Ninjazz> GilDash: She's too busy going for all the members of the Wonderbolts and Dashie to have time for you. :(
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi: More or less obsessed.
<legacyofvrak> Hello everypon3...
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Tsk, she always makes a little time for her favourite. ;)
<Panda> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz holy shit i want!
<Reikim> Panda: Oh! I thought you were talking about Rarity being OP. Yes, Fluttershy is completely OP, and will be nerfed shortly. Don't worry, she's just enraged because Angel's not around yet.
<Freefall29> hello legacyofvrak
<Ninjazz> GilDash: And just who would be her favorite? :S
<legacyofvrak> What's Up?
<Everlasting_Joy> Bronysith: :D There's so much true with that!
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Grargh!!!!
<AgentKalim> Hi there, legacyofvrak. Please enjoy your stay and remember, your soul belongs to the Elder God. :P
<Freefall29> personally. i'm not a fan of fighting games
<flutter_spin> lol
<Om> Ninjazz: There are some thing you shouldn't ask me things
<Chrysalis> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz holy cow thats awesome
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Tsk, isn't it obvious? :)
<legacyofvrak> Yeah :D
<Om> thinks
<flutter_spin> totally Bronysith
<alexxm> why does the dog have wings
<Panda> Reikim haha, so she stares down everyone, extracting information from them telepathically and roasting their brains? O_o
<Bronysith> Everlasting_Joy: very much so. WHATS WITH ALL THE ALICORNS?! and they have to be related to celestia or luna in some shape or form
<legacyofvrak> What anime is this?
<Ninjazz> GilDash: Nope. Hasn't it always been Rainbow Dash?
<Bronysith> legacyofvrak: pokemon
<HurricaneAkumin> Hey everypony :)
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz- I understand, Rarity is usually my favorit most of the time. rarity is high class!
<Freefall29> hey HurricaneAkumin
<Ponies47> Hey HurricaneAkumin :P
<RaveBrony> Hey again everypony, what are we watching? :o
<Everlasting_Joy> HOwdy HurricaneAkumin.
<Vordox> Saturn: You got Mirai Nikki? :)
<legacyofvrak> HurricaneAkumin: Hello :P
<Bronysith> RaveBrony: pokemon
<MadSurge> Bronysith: that's why I don't want to make an OC :D
<AgentKalim> Hi, RaveBrony
<GilDash> Ninjazz: She's her No. 1 fan, not her favourite. ;)
<Spy> this is what i think about pony crushes: it is weird, im sure it will never happen to me, and it is very funny
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi: Indeed! And incredibly fabulous!
<Bronysith> MadSurge: my oc is not of the pony creator. it is actually drawn
<RaveBrony> Bronysith: =_(\
<flutter_spin> LOL! Bronysith - you see the new Dan Vs Fim Chainsaw Lollipop video?
<Reikim> Panda: If you think that's the only thing her stare does to you, you're in for a nasty surprise. Asuka's little moment in Evangelion looks light by comparison.
<Freefall29> this guy has a phone. he means business man
<RaveBrony> He, AgentKalim :)
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: i do not
<Bronysith> flutter_spin: wtf
<HurricaneAkumin> What's boradcasting? Some anime show?
<MadSurge> Bronysith: thank god :D
<legacyofvrak> Hey... it seems like Digimon.. not Pokemon ¬¬
<Panda> Reikim no.... that.... looked like it hurts! O_o
<Vordox> Saturn: Awww, it's TOTALLY worth it just for the psychology.^^
<Bronysith> MadSurge: look http://jennidash.deviantart.com/art/Use-the-Force-304227938 my OC
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I'm pretty sure RD would want things to be a bit more than just number one fan and considering RD's personality... I don't think you got much chance. :$
<Reikim> Spy: inb4 you develop a pony crush
<HurricaneAkumin> It's Pokemon? Well, it doesn't seem like it...
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: i'll look it up
<Freefall29> HurricaneAkumin: no its dragon ball z
<HurricaneAkumin> Oh
<AgentKalim> No it's Fullmetal Alchemist
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> like i said before Ninjazz ,person who makes that plush does commisions, save your money
<HurricaneAkumin> Well i never watched that show before
<Freefall29> you never watched DBZ? :O
<Ninjazz> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: I will. :<
<legacyofvrak> Yeah Freefall29 ...
<Alchemist> ping?
<Alchemist> oh, nevermind
<Reikim> By the way, whoever posted the Dan Vs. comic.../)
<Rex_Mundi> Ninjazz- and dont you just LOVE Rarity's accent?
<RaveBrony> I couldnt really get into DBZ
<RaveBrony> :\
<MadSurge> Bronysith: digging the skunk stripes :)
<legacyofvrak> But I dont like it very much
<twilight_sprinkle> legacyofvrak: dont, i didnt like it, imo its very primitive
<HurricaneAkumin> No, i never really did get much into anime...
<Bronysith> MadSurge: eeeyup
<Vordox> WHY IS THAT JAPANESE WOMAN SO EASY AND AIRHEADED. urgh I cannot feel sympathy to her. EVER.
<Ninjazz> Rex_Mundi: Her voice was one of the things that I fell in love with!
<flutter_spin> I dreamt my brother walked in as I pulled up a pic of Luna wearing socks. Worst awkward situation ever.
<Reikim> Oh yeah, someday, someone has to stream Madoka on here.
<MadSurge> ^
<twilight_sprinkle> lol flutter_spin :D
<FairysHuff> I return from unconsciousness once again for the third time today. ^_^
<GilDash> Ninjazz: You know it's a fake accent, right?
<HurricaneAkumin> That dog is way too cute :3
<EpicPwnTime3> hai guys
<alexxm> whats it about Reikim
<legacyofvrak> *listening to Tron: R3C0NF1GUR3D - Fall
<Vordox> FairysHuff: Welcome back litterally.
<HurricaneAkumin> Hey EpicPwnTime3
<Freefall29> in the future there will be card games on motor bikes
<Rex_Mundi> Spy- it will happen, your heart will be claimed.
<Ninjazz> GilDash: I know every well.
<FairysHuff> Vordox: *Cuddles*
<flutter_spin> whoa

<Spy> no
<Ninjazz> GilDash: It's her voice though. :P
<Bronysith> Freefall29: its motorcycles you dildo
<Vordox> Oy dont be so front. :p
<Freefall29> you didnt get the reference Bronysith
<GilDash> Ninjazz: I know. She's worked really hard on it, I can't fault her. :)
<flutter_spin> "Look. I can call myself!"
<MadSurge> alexxm: it's about magical girls fighting witches! :D
<Bronysith> Freefall29: yes i did
<Bronysith> Freefall29: its CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES
<HurricaneAkumin> Is it just me, or does that car look a little...3D?
<RaveBrony> fail :D
<EpicPwnTime3> I'm back and this time i am LIVE From North Carolina!
<pony_5809> xD
<alexxm> hey EpicPwnTime3 hows your day been
<Reikim> alexxm: Er...it's complicated to explain. Especially without spoiling it. The best description I could give it is "An absolute, soul-crushing deconstruction of the magical girl genre, liek Evangelio did to humongous mecha only with cute girls and magical powers."
<Spy> it will not
<Ninjazz> GilDash: How bout dat singing voice? ^_^
<derpy_pony> just needs a finger
<Freefall29> he said motorbikes last time I remember it
<owlicious> madoka?
<AgentKalim> toooooooooooooooooooot
<Reikim> alexxm:*like Evangelion did
<Everlasting_Joy> FUUUU-.
<alexxm> thanks Reikim
<Pinkies4thWall|Sleep> Is anypony else getting a white stream box?
<FairysHuff> So I tried out Krater a little bit. It's actually quite good and amusing
<GilDash> Ninjazz: Eh heh, yeah. :D
<flutter_spin> refresh Pinkies4thWall|Sleep
<MadSurge> Pinkies4thWall|Sleep: refresh!
<pony_5809> :D
<Rex_Mundi> Any good fan-made human versions of Rarity's dresses out there?
<HurricaneAkumin> I guess you have to watch this full episode to get it, because i really don't.
<FairysHuff> Great music, well worth buying the special edition for. And they have alot of amuxing one liners. ^_^
<Reikim> alexxm: I'd recommend it highly. It's only about a dozen episodes too, so it's not like One Piece where you have to sit through 500 episodes and STILL not be finished...
<Dark_Horst> what's Krater?
<Wrek> 05Sumica
<kidzrul434> BRONIES HELP! THE REPLACEMENT TV THAT I USE TO PLAY WII AND XBOX ISN'T WORKING!

<flutter_spin> Rex_Mundi: yeah, hangon

<owlicious> OH YEAH
<FairysHuff> Wrek: Ah you are ^_^ So I gave in and bought Krater
<RainbowBlitz> Hay everypony, Hay wrek.

<Rex_Mundi> flutter_spin- thats cool, but I meant real life dresses.
<flutter_spin> oh, like you can buy?
<Wrek> 05HurricaneAkumin: doesnt count image links as long as the image doesnt break the content rules FairysHuff: nice any good? thinking of buyign it tomorrow.
<Spy> how do i send a message supposed to get to a person so it appears as a "pling" in that persons chatlog?
<RainbowBlitz> This is odd.
<RainbowBlitz> the third day in a row.
<RainbowBlitz> I come in and we're watching anime not ponieez xD
<EpicPwnTime3> Yes this is very odd
<Vordox> Worst police ever.
<Shizuka> 13you have to sacrifice a virgin hard drive

<Ninjazz> Woo~
<FairysHuff> Wrek: Yes. It's not ground breaking but it is fun. Great soundtrack, well worth the special edition. I listened to it while napping. And the characters have some parody one liners. Like the warrior guy will say "If it bleeds, we can kill it" in an arnie voice ^_^
<AgentKalim> Good stream everybody, good stream.
<LochNessCheez> t'was a great show

<LochNessCheez> we're singing winter wrap up again
*RainbowBlitz takes fluttershy home.
<Saturn> 08,01diddutz: it's because it's bigger on the inside and makes funny noises
<flutter_spin> "and even though I love my boots, this fashion is getting old"
<RainbowBlitz> She's mine now.
<RainbowBlitz> ALL MINE
<TOY_PON3> Nooo Fluttershy he's gonna do bad things to you!!!

<diddutz> Saturn: Try not to leave the brakes on ^^
<Pinkies4thWall|mad> am i missing out on a stream?
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: yeah, mine's on its way out
<DuskStarshimmer> LochNessCheez, :CCC
<flutter_spin> I don't know pet song. I always found that song more of a .. chatter than actual song
<Freefall29> stream derped out
<Saturn> 08,01that's why the video would sometimes stutter
<TOY_PON3> alexxm: Yea no stream atm
<FairysHuff> GilDash: I was pissed off at the time but it's been two years. I have mourned.
<Ponies47> alexxm: Saturn just finshed
<Saturn> 08,01VioletVanilla is setting up
<Rex_Mundi> Spy- you still want to talk about pony crushes? Well, everypony here who has/had a pony crush, say so now!
<Saturn> 08,01she'll be streaming in a minute
<flutter_spin> TRADING CARDS!
<TOY_PON3> o:

<TOY_PON3> Yeth!
<mooponi> what episode # was that?
<Bronysith> flutter_spin: on motorcycles
<GilDash> FairysHuff: Well, I guess that makes much more sense. :)
<LochNessCheez> We were talking about MLP cards before
<mooponi> the last one
<FairysHuff> Saturn: Hope you have everything on it backed up to another drive then. Cause I didn't ^_^ That hurt.
<alexxm> thanks TOY_PON3 and Ponies47 had to deal with some internet issues
<Blue_Leaf> Wooo!
<TOY_PON3> alexxm: That's all bad
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: it's just stuff i've downloaded
<alexxm> been dealt with
<Ponies47> alexxm: Okie doki loki. That suckz :<
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: no biggie i lose it
<flutter_spin> I'll buy a couple packs, but $2 for what.. 4 cards and 'a stick of gum' isn't worth it
<Spy> what i mean is that it sound litterarly IMPOSSIBLE
<FairysHuff> Saturn: fairy fluff.
<RainbowBlitz> Trading cards? SO AWESOME (Insert dashface here)
<CrimsonPhoenix> http://fav.me/d4xdrzz THIS IS STILL THE BEST THING I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS
<TOY_PON3> Indeed
<LochNessCheez> btw owlicious
<owlicious> what?
<LochNessCheez> you spelt Owloysius wrong
<Rex_Mundi> Spy- it happens
<Blue_Leaf> CrimsonPhoenix: CUUUUTTTEEEE....
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> chat derped for me again =/
<FairysHuff> Anyone know if Magic the Gathering will be available on Android Market place? I know it's coming to Apple I Pad
<owlowscious> damn
<TOY_PON3> owlowdjsjdjf
<RainbowBlitz> LochNessCheez: You're both wrong, its owlowicious
<TOY_PON3> see now I can't spell it
<Freefall29> is the stream derping for anyone?
<Eztio--> hey everone. i'm back
<LochNessCheez> really?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> oh how i do love youtubes captioning system, as 'twere http://derpiboo.ru/19101
<LochNessCheez> so the wiki was wrong?
<RainbowBlitz> LochNessCheez: Yeah.
<alexxm> FairysHuff when is it coming for the ipad first i've heard of this
<Ponies47> Hey Eztio-- welcome back :)
<flutter_spin> I used to be a huge card collector. Now that my cards sit on the shelf, I'm not big on doing it anymore
<Pinkies4thWall> So the site is broken on my Firefox browser, but not Chrome. that's fucked up
<owloysius> damn again
<alexxm> hey Ezito-- hows your day been
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Not sure. But I think it may already be out on Ipad
<Rex_Mundi> Was that Owl one of the things Hasbro dictated to be in the show?
*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG found out that SuperBrony64 has Halo
<owloysius> no idea
<Ninjazz> CrimsonPhoenix: :D
<Blue_Leaf> I might finally be able to get a cell phone :D
<Eztio--> alexxm: it's been good
<Saturn> 08,01the correct spelling is Owloysius
<RainbowBlitz> Lauren faust said that its spelled owlowicious but it would have been closer to the real name if she'd spelled it owloysious.
<TOY_PON3> Pinkies4thWall: It's the exact opposite for me
<Blue_Leaf> EVERYONE'S WRONG!
<Saturn> 08,01as it's a corruption of the name Aloysius
<RainbowBlitz> EVERYONE IS PINKIE
<RainbowBlitz> Wait what.
<Vordox> EVERYTHING IS WRONG IN THIS WORLD; EVEN PI ITSELF!
<Eztio--> How many Kerbals died last night?
<Lil_B> Saturn my grandmothers name es Eloysia
<FairysHuff> Saturn: The correct spelling is "AH F*CK! YOUR CLAWS ARE SHARP SH*T!"
<Pinkies4thWall> TOY_PON3: on chrome are you getting white embed windows?
<Blue_Leaf> My name is Blue Leaf, that's that.
<TOY_PON3> EVERYONE IS WRONG! IT'S canterlock!
<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: yes
<TOY_PON3> Pinkies4thWall: Yeah
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Eztio--: probably over a 100 died
<Freefall29> RainbowBlitz: CODE RED!
<Eztio--> e_o
<AgentKalim> CANTERLOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
<flutter_spin> So if there are 137 cards total and you get 4 +1 for like $2... kind of expensive for me
<Pinkies4thWall> TOY_PON3: by chance do you run Win7?
<RainbowBlitz> EVERYPONY RUN FOR COVER
<FairysHuff> Don't forget everyone. Pet Owls on youtube. Check it out.
<Custard> I have to go... Bye everypony
<Rex_Mundi> I still dont trust that Owl, I expected it to start hooting evil at the end of the episode.
<TOY_PON3> Pinkies4thWall: Yes ._.
<Blue_Leaf> WARNING: PINKIE IS BRAKING MY LAPTOP SCREEN. HELLLPPPP!
<Pinkies4thWall> by Custard

<Eztio--> who has a mac?????
<Pinkies4thWall> TOY_PON3: did your win7 recently install an update?
<Blue_Leaf> flutter_spin: Not at all D:
<FairysHuff> I hate apple. Overpriced dookie
<Eztio--> NO
<TOY_PON3> Pinkies4thWall: Not that I know of
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> mac computers are pretty cool but just arent that powerful
<TOY_PON3> ^
<Eztio--> i'm a pc
<Lil_B> ^
<Freefall29> Mac's are good for professional work, but for entertainment/gaming.... hell to the no
<Pinkies4thWall> hmm. mine did, and Firefox was working just fine prior.
<flutter_spin> http://dan-vs-fim.tumblr.com/post/17096740111 pffft
<Eztio--> Alien ware does the job for that
<Reikim> I would only by a Mac ever if I wanted to do music composition or DJing. And even then I'm pretty sure I could run that off a regular laptop.
<Reikim> *buy
<Pinkies4thWall> I use Firefox for ALL my heavy browsing.
<Eztio--> i allways use chrome
<TOY_PON3> Pinkies4thWall: That's weird
<Blue_Leaf> flutter_spin: ;_;
<FairysHuff> I use ROyal Mail ^_^ HAH!
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Eztio--: ^
<Reikim> Okay...okay...silly question here...WHO HERE USES INTERNET EXPLORER?
<Rex_Mundi> GREATINGS... from the past. I am communicated to you from the year of 1999. Now tell me, what are thes PONIES you speek of?
<Pinkies4thWall> funny. I have Chrome, Firefox, AND IE installed
<Ponies47> I has a HP Pavilion 754n. It is a old old model :(
<Eztio--> i don't think may people do...
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhif1x_d_AQ&feature=channel&list=UL
<Reikim> Pinkies4thWall: But do you ever USE that last one?
<hen3ry> Rex_Mundi: When you get back to 1999, buy me some Apple stock kthxbai
<Pinkies4thWall> Reikim: lolno
<TOY_PON3> So..my question is...what is with all the weird things going on in TF2?
<Eztio--> i have a pavilion dv5
<diddutz> Pinkies4thWall: is there a difference between normal and heavy browsing?
<Reikim> Pinkies4thWall: /)
<Freefall29> Rex_Mundi: there seems to be a bad connection. they are spelled pony's. not ponies. its 1999 so that explains it
<VioletVanilla> 06Reikim: You can, music production though the software on a mac ist normally more preferred~
<Lil_B> Apple does some good things, but they just demand so high licensing fees that nobody adapts to their Technogogyls (like the Thunderbold-Cable)
<Pinkies4thWall> /) Reikim
*Bronysith glomps VioletVanilla

<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: What Chaos will you cause today?
<Reikim> Saturn: What did you do...
<GilDash> Saturn: How so?

<sagas[A]> Im confused what Saturn is talking about
<Reikim> Lil_B: I refuse to accept IE and remain steadfast in my fotress of Firefox.
<Saturn> 08,01and they were laughing so much that she couldn't scan item through anymore
<CriticKitten> Ha.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: Good for you
<sagas[A]> Reikim: should try Chrome
<AgentKalim> I am also a steadfast proponent of Firefox.
<GilDash> Saturn: Huge fit of the giggles then. :)
<MadSurge> Saturn: your mother sounds like quite the character :D

<flutter_spin> Anyone else go see "Brave"? I want a second opinion.
<Rex_Mundi> Anybody here get any strang looks whilst buying pony toys/
<Lil_B> Reikim I don't want you to switch XD the best browser usually is the one you are most familiar with, I'm, just saying that IE9 isn't bad XD
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: did ppl look at you like they wanted to choke you since you paused the whole checkout?
<Reikim> Okay, bye everyone, I'll be back later.
<sagas[A]> Reikim: Well to each their own. I feel the same about Firefox
<Jony_216> I give the award of "Shittest program known to man" To google chrome XD

<Saturn> 08,01that video gives me chills
<flutter_spin> I can't wait CrimsonPhoenix . I couldn't quite tell from the animation if Luna appeared to be 'stealing the kids (evil)' or just having an adventure (good)
<CrimsonPhoenix> Read the story in the blog
*ObservantGunny watches Saturn
<Rex_Mundi> flutterspin- have yoy seen the fanfic? its like reading "cupcakes"

<Rex_Mundi> Rainbow- the one with Lyra, getting petted by a human, licking a suger cube.
<Freefall29> Rainbow: so that's the stuff doing that man? bummer
<Vordox> This song sounds...
<Vordox> I don't know, something special...
<flutter_spin> My take on EQD has worsened over the past few months.
<Eztio--> is this why mario eats shrooms?
<bloodybrony> reading a bout flutterbunny
<Ponies47> BRB
<CrimsonPhoenix> I don't know Jony_216 but I love it
<Rainbow> Rex_Mundi: Can you show me the pic?

<VioletVanilla> 06c:

<Starflash> Ha, I knew it :3
<Freefall29> I gotta lay off these groovy syringes man
<Kakumy> flutter_spin: that frikin Lyra...
<diddutz> I don't get it, Vivi lives in the same country as me but i still get most lag when she streams; confound that technology ...
*Starflash hugs VioletVanilla
<flutter_spin> yeah, well someone requested the pic
<Rex_Mundi> flutter_spin- thats the one
<Ponies47> Back :P
<flutter_spin> I'm usually good at finding stuff :P
<Lil_B> (btw, whats the actual musical Term for "Wubs" ?)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> VioletVanilla: lol where do you get these tripping scenes?
<AgentKalim> They're just wubs. :P
<Rainbow> flutter_spin: THe Lyra part of it is adorable, the human part... disturbing-ish.
<Ninjazz|Observant> Distortion?
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Lil_B: Bass
<Eztio--> what lyra? in human???
<flutter_spin> yeah Rain
<Rex_Mundi> flutter_spin- EqD should get better once season 3 starts.
<Kakumy> No pony songs?
<Rainbow> Probably because I find Lyra to be adorable.
<flutter_spin> ehh, don't care for this song
<Kakumy> Who streaming btw?
<flutter_spin> Violet stream
<Rainbow> I am entranced...
<Starflash> Lil_B: wub = wobble bass~
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Kakumy: VioletVanilla
<flutter_spin> You can usually tell by what is streaming :P
<Kakumy> Oh..
<Ninjazz|Observant> This sounfs familiar.
<Lil_B> Starflash really? and the higher wubs?
<diddutz> Lil_B: I don't think there is one, so wubs are wubs, but i allso heard the term wobbles
<Ninjazz|Observant> sounds*
<Eztio--> JUST MAH BASS CANNON!!!
<MadSurge> Kakumy: also known as ViVi
<flutter_spin> Sunday is usually Violet's Radio Stream
<Starflash> I think the higher wubs is the same but pitched :D
<Rainbow> When I saw that white blob, I thought of Celestia.
<EpicPwnTime3> hai guys!
<Eztio--> so what's a monday like?
<Lil_B> diddutz ok, thanks :)
<AgentKalim> She cleans them... with WUBS
<Rex_Mundi> Rainbow- the pic is not really the problem, its the fanfic that its based on.
<flutter_spin> Well, most days are random, but my schedule has Monday as Wrek's Drawing Day
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Lil_B: like me and Starflash sayd wubs= bass in the simplest of terms
<Rainbow> Rex_Mundi: Oh... oh dear Celestia save us.
<Starflash> still wobble though :3
<Starflash> normal bass wouldnt sound this weird~
<Eztio--> well i'll find the terms through-out the week then
<Pinkies4thWall> i liek deadmaus
<flutter_spin> Yeah, its more like whoever is on...
*Starflash raises his weapon.
<Kakumy> I like Skrillex :P
<Eztio--> meh
<Rainbow> Someone gonna pick up the bass? It's been over 5 seconds.
<Rainbow> The bass has been dropped.
<Starflash> Rainbow, it's supposed to be dropped, leave it be.
<Skylands> 10asdf
<diddutz> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: you're right wubs are bass, but bass is not a good term to describe wubs
<Lil_B> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz but Bass is such a big term, and i was more thinking about just the Dubstep like wubs
<Skylands> 10Good, I am still connected
<Kakumy> Well nothing to do so bye guys :D
<Lil_B> bye Kakumy
<AgentKalim> Bye, Kakumy

<CriticKitten> I don't hate Rarity persay, but I do tend to hate Rarity episodes. Because more often than not, they tend to mess up her character. >_>

<VioletVanilla> 06Hallo~ (:
<Braviary> I come on here and OH IT'S LOUD MY EARS :'(
<Eztio--> ___--___
<Freefall29> hey VioletVanilla!
<Wrek> 05Braviary: fantastic isnt it?
<PonyBrony> dat music
<Starflash> Braviary: it's not loud... it's called epic
<Braviary> It keeps buffering, so I wouldn't know.

<VioletVanilla> 06Freefall29~ (:
<Eztio--> A wild Braviary apeared!!
<Braviary> Braviary used Sky Drop!
<Starflash> I used to have plans, but then musik stream. Oh well.
<Bronysith> sokka rape face http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/internet-memes-youll-feel-fire-after-though.jpg
<flutter_spin> dang it! Why did one of the thousand random thoughts that rushed in my mind had to be "I wish I was Luna's socks"
<Everlasting_Joy> flutter_spin: It works for those with a foot fetish.
<flutter_spin> I don't though
<flutter_spin> WOOT this song
<Eztio--> this remindsme of a nightmare
<Starflash> Oh this :D
<Ninjazz|Observant> Or... Pony socks are hawt. Ever though about that? Hmmm?
<DashWithRainbows> VioletVanilla Are you doing your radio show right now? If you are, why am I missing it?
<Ponies47> YAY! :)
<Starflash> DashWithRainbows: Tune in, nooowwww
<Ninjazz|Observant> DashWithRainbows: Get in here!
<Bronysith> damn it all. derpy i love you so much but please STAY OUT OF MY COMPUTER
<Rex_Mundi> ponies in socks doesnt always have to be fetish. Theres some innocent and cute ponies in Socks art out there.
<flutter_spin> http://th05.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2012/103/a/c/luna__socks__by_lerauxart-d4w1jp6.png um, of course I do
<Braviary> Whatever you're streaming, I still haven't gotten more than one and a half seconds of it.
<owloysius> socks. socks everywhere
<VioletVanilla> 06DashWithRainbows: Because you are not watching c;
<Nightmare> Do the Discord (Sim Gretina Remix) next.

<Skylands> 10fgsfds
<owloysius> i think it's just wmp visualization
<MadSurge> Oh boy, my parents are arguing -__-
<Saturn> 08,01so i've been reading about UAV drones today
<sagas[A]> Saturn: fun things
<Saturn> 08,01the things they can do with unmanned aircraft now, it's simply amazing
<AgentKalim> Dis cord
<Bronysith> Saturn: how are tehy going to rape us?
<AgentKalim> Dat cord too
<Starflash> Bronysith wut.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14fun fact: UAVs require three kills to call in :3
<flutter_spin> so random
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: well, i postulate that in 10 - 20 years, we'll no longer have commercial airline pilots
<VioletVanilla> 06ITs not wmp visualization X3
<DashWithRainbows> SaxyPretender unless you have hardline bro.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> who wants to bet some UAV's are made in China >.>
<Everlasting_Joy> SaxyPretender: *Facepalm.
<Bronysith> Saturn: and self aware computers, either
<SaxyPretender> 0,14touche
<Braviary> Spy Planes > UAVs.
<Bronysith> Saturn: EITHER AM or skynet...i pray for skynet
<Ninjazz|Observant> SaxyPretender: Then it's two.
<VioletVanilla> 06MadSurge: ): Listen to the musik und be happy <3
<GilDash> Saturn: Would people trust in that though? We might have an airline piolet just for people's faith.
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: i don't think we'll ever have self-aware computers
<Rex_Mundi> *swedish spitfire voice* "Soarin's apple pie"
<AgentKalim> Saturn: I honestly hope they're not stupid enough to make planes WITHOUT any manual control in them. I don't wanna leet haxxorz crashing my planes remotely.
<sagas[A]> Saturn: Would you accept their use by the police?
<LochNessCheez> so, um... interesting stream
<Starflash> LochNessCheez: Ikr.
<sagas[A]> Saturn: As a tool of law enforcement
<Nightmare> Luna's war ftw
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, dat sad feel when jet pilots won't be relevant thanks to UAVs
<Saturn> 08,01well, i certainly see the role of pilots being reduced from flying the planes to manual control if things go wrong
<MadSurge> VioletVanilla: If I stay out of it they leave me alone, they're still loud though :D
<Saturn> 08,01and not all flights having them
<Pinkies4thWall> SaxyPretender: i hate to think of it
<SaxyPretender> 0,14ikr?
<Ninjazz|Observant> SaxyPretender: But less pilot error.
<Bronysith> eewwww dubstep
<owloysius> pilot error is pretty low
<Everlasting_Joy> SaxyPretender: Sadly, the same can't be said of the soldier.
<Pinkies4thWall> unmanned flight =/= flight
<owloysius> you could go a thousand years flying once a day without crashing
<SaxyPretender> 0,14but that means a Top Gun remake in the future won't be culturally relevant
<Pinkies4thWall> :(
<Ninjazz|Observant> D:
<Saturn> 08,01SaxyPretender: see, silver lining!
<owloysius> you'd probably choke on a pretzel, though
<SaxyPretender> 0,14no, that's bad!
<Everlasting_Joy> VioletVanilla: What is the name of this song? I want to find it.
<Saturn> 08,01Everlasting_Joy: i think you're wrong there
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I liek Top Gun ;__;
<Rex_Mundi> You think the Mane 6 could ever visit a Japan-like area of Equestria? That would be neat.
<VioletVanilla> 06Luna (Alex S Remix)
<Everlasting_Joy> VioletVanilla: Thank you :).
<Saturn> 08,01Everlasting_Joy: have you seen what they're doing with robots these days?
<owloysius> and then a giant reptile could attack... did that
<DashWithRainbows> but SaxyPretender, you are a top gun.
<CriticKitten> Gotta agree with Saturn, a remake of Top Gun only opens the door for them to ruin it.
<Saturn> 08,01look up BigDog
<CriticKitten> Virtually everything that gets remade anymore is ruined. >_>
<VioletVanilla> 06Everlasting_Joy: (:
<Lil_B> Saturn well, the Self-Awareness of PC is (for me) a question about how close can it be. It can never be Full-Selfawareness, but it can get closer, and close, and closer
<SaxyPretender> 0,14also, all your faces when they are making another Top Gun movie apparently
<Metronome> "facepalm" at my previous comment sry violetvanilla
<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn: Most people think "robots will fight for us in the future", but I propose, why keep your opponents alive when you want them dead?
<Saturn> 08,01but yeah, the military are going to have autonomous "soldier" land drones in 20 - 30 years
<Pinkies4thWall> DashWithRainbows: i am # 49 on the ace combat global leaderboard. does that make me a top gun?
<Ninjazz|Observant> SaxyPretender: Not sure if good or bad thing at this point. :S
<Alchemist> not exactly robotics, but there is the HULC exoskeleton too.
<Rex_Mundi> There might be a pony anime someday, like how Powerpuffgirls got one
<Saturn> 08,01take it from someone who is familiar with the state of the art
<DashWithRainbows> SaxyPretender This can either go well or completly burn in a huge falling fireball of scrap metal.
<Alchemist> and the TADS system on the apaches.
<Wrek> 05Everlasting_Joy: got spotify? putting some of my fav metal songs on a playlsit there that you can sub
<Starflash> :(
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: yeah, exoskeletons are awesome

<Chrysalis> Wrek can you pm me a link when you get chance im in game so i might miss it
<Wrek> 05ok Chrysalis
<sagas[A]> buffer
<killerpony7733> sagas[A]: hiya
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: I do not have spotify, but what I was proposing was, if you want people to find you, I can put it on your post on BwB.
<sagas[A]> hey killerpony7733 :)
<Rex_Mundi> Hey @wrek, got any Primus, i know thats not metal, but Primus has the best bass guitare ever. Mr.Knowitall is the greatest song.
<Starflash> ugh, dat buffer :T
<Kandarihu> when sagas[A] had buffer, I did too.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If a computer can program itself, then we have a shot at AI.
<Bronysith> http://twentypercentcooler.net/post/show/20768/alicorn-butterfly_cutie_mark-crown-dialogue-duo-eq
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01True AI.
<Everlasting_Joy> Saturn: I don't doubt robots will fight with us, but using them alone and keeping humans alive ultimately, even after the fight, I doubt that.
<Ninjazz|Observant> That sounds... impossibru.
<Freefall29> Nittany_Discord: then how do we stop them from becoming self aware?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I don't know.
<Pinkies4thWall> lol Bronysith
<Rex_Mundi> Computers dont have souls
<sagas[A]> Whats wrong with self awareness?
<GilDash> Nittany_Discord: Can we *not* start the technological singularity, please?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Create a program the shuts down the machine if it programs itself too fast or too much.
<VioletVanilla> 06Computers can never program themselves, because the amount of time it would take for a programmer to programm it to programm itself would be decades, even centuries
<Nightmare> Nightmare Night by WoodenToaster
<Freefall29> sagas[A]: if they get the idea they are suprerior then their creators, they won't like taking orders from what they find inferior.
<Rex_Mundi> Geez, transhumanists are a strange brand of people
<Very_Silly_Filly> Hey everypony
<Saturn> 08,01VioletVanilla: that... is not necessarily true
<PartyCannon> They are deterministic... for now
*Bronysith glomps Very_Silly_Filly
<sagas[A]> Nittany_Discord: What if it goes in and alters its own coding?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Finally healed everything
<Saturn> 08,01VioletVanilla: we already have self modifying and self adapting programs
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Then we're screwed.
<Ninjazz|Observant> Hey there, Very_Silly_Filly! How is the hand?
<Kandarihu> The stream is working fine for the most part.
<Very_Silly_Filly> After around a month, my injuries are healed
<Ninjazz|Observant> Woo
<PartyCannon> i.e. Viri
<Very_Silly_Filly> Ninjazz|Observant: Hand's been fine a while, but a few small scars around it
<Eztio--> BR34CH - by BlackGryph0n
<PartyCannon> like Flame and Stuxnet
<MadSurge> VioletVanilla: computers can calculate and process, but they still can't really "think"
<sagas[A]> Im fine with AI's taking over
<CriticKitten> Teaching a computer how to program itself to adapt to a situation is more time consuming than just programming it to adapt to that situation in the first place.
<PartyCannon> *malware
<GilDash> VioletVanilla: Just because it'll take a long time, doesn't mean it'll never happen.
<Ninjazz|Observant> Very_Silly_Filly: Better than last time we last saw you though, at least?
<VioletVanilla> 06Saturn: Self modifying und self adapting to what its been programmed to do
<Rex_Mundi> You guys forget about howmuch bullshit have to put up with computers, im not worried about advance AIs
<CriticKitten> So it's not so much that it's impossible, it's just pointless.
<Saturn> 08,01seriously, take a look at the state of the art in computer science reserach; some of the things that scientists are doing in the field at the moment are downright scary and straight out of science fiction
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah, the stitching is just about gone
<sagas[A]> Im fine with this
<Ninjazz|Observant> Sounds good. ^^
<Saturn> 08,01VioletVanilla: programs already exist that right programs, though
<Saturn> 08,01*write
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01VSF: Your hand is repaired?
<CriticKitten> Saturn: Do any of them do anything useful? :P
<VioletVanilla> 06They write them ja but they only write what they are supposed to
<Sumica> 00,10damn you mips why must you do this to me during Vivi's streaming
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten: psht, this is science
<Very_Silly_Filly> Nittany_Discord: Around 90%
<CriticKitten> So then no. :P
<Freefall29> what song is this?
<Ponies47> BRB :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> Few stitches need to go, but it feels fine
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Does it work well?
<Starflash> Ikr Sumica :<
<Ninjazz|Observant> ^
<Very_Silly_Filly> Yeah
<Saturn> 08,01VioletVanilla: yes, but then, when you combine the two concepts, you can have programs that write entirely novel programs
<owloysius> well, there's watson, and what they're working on after that
<Saturn> 08,01and this kind of stuff *does* exist now
<CriticKitten> My point is that it's easier to just tell the little robot drone how to cross a river than to program it with the ABILITY to program itself to learn how to cross a river.
<VioletVanilla> 06Saturn: Very true c:
<Eztio--> DAT BUFFER
<owloysius> they're planning to have that as an assistant
<sagas[A]> Vive l'avancement!

*VioletVanilla hugs LadyCanary und Shizuka
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: ^
<Kandarihu> Not buffering for me this time.
<Alchemist> Yes those adaptive programs may only adapt in the way they are programmed, but its a start. Your brain is limited too. Its dependant on the balance of certain chemicals.
<Freefall29> Saturn: hopefully it wont
<VioletVanilla> 06Saturn: Sorry. .. I mean that ><
*LadyCanary blushes ^^" Hello everyone!
<Zephyr> is that the WMP visualizer?
<Rex_Mundi> It first has to recognize what a 'river' is, the real world is far too complicated for an artificial mind to comprehend, way too many variables. Any advanced AI would just seem autistic.
<MadSurge> SaxyPretender: yeah, let's wait out on sentient programs
<Ninjazz|Observant> ^_^
<AgentKalim> Hoooowdy there, LadyCanary. I remember you from way back.
<VioletVanilla> 06Its not wmp visualizer, its a programme called G-Force
<alexxm> back from dinner i miss much
<Freefall29> A computer first needs a personality to become self aware.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I finished Zelda OoT Master quest yesterday
<LadyCanary> :O Whoa! AgentKalim! I remember you!
*Shizuka 13hides in vivi's mane
<owloysius> the goal is self awareness, not imitating humans

<Zephyr> oh yeah, g-force. true
<sagas[A]> Saturn: why? Isnt life and thought nothing more than a complex series of algorithms

<MadSurge> Hi LadyCanary! Got more cosplay trivia to share? ;)
<Alchemist> sagas[A]: the thought process is, but its backed up by an even more complex biological/biochemical system. an awesome combination :)
<LadyCanary> MadSurge: ^^" Not at the moment. Just that I wanna learn how to sew and stuff ._.
<Very_Silly_Filly> First, they need to program AI to not be retarded in some aspects
<Rex_Mundi> Not enough processing power for an AI to not seem bumbling trying to comprehend the real world. Its a pointless waste of time and money trying to creat something self aware, its a task beyound us.
<Very_Silly_Filly> I created my first advanced AI recently, and it's still a pain
<sagas[A]> Alchemist: Well isnt an advanced enough thought process all thats needed for self awareness?
<FairysHuff> BREASTS!
<MadSurge> LadyCanary: and how are things?
<icybeauti> Hi everypony!
<Very_Silly_Filly> I programmed a platform AI that can jump up platforms and see you from a distance
<alexxm> FairysHuff where
<VioletVanilla> 06icybeauti~ c:
<LadyCanary> Well...today is my special somepony's birthday, MadSurge <3
<alexxm> hey icybeauti hows your day been

<Ninjazz|Observant> Hey there, icybeauti. :)
<LadyCanary> Hiya icybeauti
<Saturn> 08,01Rex_Mundi: oh, i don't think it's beyond us, i just think we'll wipe ourselves out before we manage to do it
<FairysHuff> alexxm: Here *Touches moobs*
<Alchemist> sagas[A]: you need a hardvare to run it on and it seems that the current technology is far from sufficient.
<icybeauti> Heya VioletGreySha Hi Ninjazz|Observant Hi LadyCanary and i alexxm.
<Freefall29> Saturn: looks like it
<Saturn> 08,01Alchemist: the way things are going to go is neural nets on quantum computers
<MadSurge> LadyCanary: :O happy birthday to your boyfriend then!
<VioletGreySha> icybeauti: i guess not me :P
<Very_Silly_Filly> Saturn: At our current rate, we'll kill ourselfs in the next decade
<VioletVanilla> 06VioletGreySha <3

<MadSurge> Ohai icybeauti!
<VioletGreySha> VioletVanilla: :3
<Rex_Mundi> Transhumanists are naive to the 10th degree.

<MadSurge> VioletVanilla: eeehhhh not really
<Freefall29> I cant wait for the teleporter to be created
*VioletGreySha hugs Starflash
<GilDash> Saturn: Quantum PCs? How far do you think we're off of them in the household?

<MadSurge> Freefall29: so we can become fat for good :D
<alexxm> hey VioletGreySha hows your day been
<Ninjazz|Observant> Time for a party.
<MadSurge> This calls for a party!
<Freefall29> party. pinky pie style
<Very_Silly_Filly> MadSurge: I wouldn't use a teleporter, unless I was going ages away
<Rex_Mundi> I have to leave the chat
<VioletGreySha> alexxm: one word that describes it: Diablo 3
<Very_Silly_Filly> Like Britain to America
<Freefall29> spys sappin mah teleporter
<FairysHuff> Well just finished a 3 hour TGS podcast I've been watched in bits over three days ^_^ Now to watch another.
<alexxm> so good then VioletGreySha
<FairysHuff> *watching
<SCP> Why does the releated box get filled up with this stupid pony shit.
<SCP> It isn't intresting.
<MadSurge> Very_Silly_Filly: yeah, that's what I would use them for.
<Lil_B> a good question is: how to give an AI the ability to find a solution to a problem for which it was not prorammed for, without giving him the instrucions to solv the problem.
<AgentKalim> Ain't no party like a Pinkie Pie party
<Wrek> 05Chrysalis: the preliminary lsit is done: http://open.spotify.com/user/joish/playlist/0FDICVUwvEjQaauzVjRzf0

<VioletGreySha> alexxm: i dont know if its good that i dont do anything then play it xD
<Very_Silly_Filly> Everypony knows the hookshot from Zelda? I want one :)
<icybeauti> Did you guys do the movie raffle yet?
<Vordox> This song is VERY familiar. why?
<Very_Silly_Filly> I could get places so easily with one

<SCP> The thing is
<SCP> Youtube is bad because of ponies

<MadSurge> SCP: no, it was bad even before ponies.
<Nightmare> SCP: Cool opinion bro

<Very_Silly_Filly> No, with my starcannon, powered on plasma from blood, shoots miniture stars that blows up and devistates the area it exploded
<Kandarihu> SCP perceives the prevalance of MLP related Youtube videos as an annoyance and he thinks that he can stop it by coming here and telling us to stop.
<LadyCanary> As much as I dont like GNR, I have a spot for this song <3
<MadSurge> Nightmare: eeyup!
<Alchemist> instant feel good for everyone: http://derpy.me/R0yX1
<Saturn> 08,01it's like... what the hell do you expect to achieve coming into a brony chatroom and hating on bronies?

<Saturn> 08,01FairysHuff: ha! yes!
<Eztio--> e_o
<MadSurge> Alchemist: hugs are the best thing <3
<Kandarihu> ObservantGunny, the problem might be on your end.
<Freefall29> trolls are fun, especially when they leave because they sucked at trolling

<LadyCanary> :D Wreky!!!
<Freefall29> thats why you counter-troll them
<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: Yes?
<Wrek> 05did you have spotify?
*VioletVanilla hugs everypony
<FairysHuff> Saturn: There are soooo many people like that. And I think I keep meeting them all everytime I go outside O_o
<Kandarihu> It lagged once for me at first, but no more after that.
<Eztio--> Troll the Troller, i like it
*Wrek hugs Vivi~

<Everlasting_Joy> Wrek: I do not :(. I don't think I'll get it, but I can link to it for others to find it if you want.
<VioletVanilla> 06Enjoying the bits you can see. . ? ):
*Ninjazz|Observant hugs VioletVanilla back
<MadSurge> Eztio--: trolling trolls is great ;D
<Ninjazz|Observant> Most definately.
<Freefall29> welcome to the internet.jpg
<Kandarihu> I wouldn't consider someone like that a troll. He's just objecting to the entire Brony community.
<junh1024-XD> Skylands and SilverSonic i herd you liek to keybroad mashing.
<GilDash> VioletVanilla: I've got the music, and that's the best bit. :)
<Eztio--> yet Troll TRolling skills have dimmed down
<junh1024-XD> Is dat tr00?
<Bronysith> WTF http://derpy.me/ou49y
<MadSurge> VioletVanilla: Yes! Best bits ever!
<Freefall29> trolls pretty much insult fan bases now... they used to try to be as offensive has possible. I guess the flame has died a bit
<FairysHuff> I was wondering if the community would be interested in a scheduled weekly Worms (Steam) stream that random community members could participate in?
<Eztio--> Bronysith: i though it was a pinkie pie launcher
<alexxm> Bronysith he seems so angry about the situation as well
<Kandarihu> He's obviously an anti-brony who is having a lot of trouble using Youtube without running into Pony related videos in the suggestions. That guy's at wits end.
<Ninjazz|Observant> Coming to a brony stream does not fix anything, though.
<Freefall29> we should do a steam event some time soon. counter-strike source?
<Lil_B> I would like a Audio only option for the Stream XD not thats i don't like the visuals, they are just a bit too bright at times for me :)
<FairysHuff> If he comes back troll him by pretending to be gay.
<Bronysith> http://derpy.me/0fu3T
<VioletVanilla> 06Lil_B: I will work on that for you sweetie (:
<Eztio--> Copy that
<Freefall29> FairysHuff: that would only help his argument dude
<MadSurge> Kandarihu: it's not our fault if ponies go with anything and are awesome. :D
<Kandarihu> Ninjazz|Observant I agree. But I think that to him, it might've seemed like a good idea at the time.
<Freefall29> FairysHuff: trolls accuse brony's of being gay... act gay would support their argument
<FairysHuff> Freefall29: Why? Nothing wrong with being gay. And it would drive him mad even more
<Eztio--> Ace of Spades?
<LadyCanary> Hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooome~
<Bronysith> Freefall29: homophobe are you?
<FairysHuff> Freefall29: So?
<Kandarihu> MadSurge: I agree with that too. I'd imagine that he might take his anti-brony crusade to Equestria Daily.
<Alchemist> dammit my flashplayer crashed again
<Freefall29> Bronysith: no. not that
<AgentKalim> Nothing wrong with driving trolls mad, if you ask me. Live by the troll, die by the troll.
<Ninjazz|Observant> Kandarihu: I can see his view point. Coming here to deal with his problems head on. Maybe even vent a little, but in the end... it was extremely foolish.
<Freefall29> i'm just not gonna give trolls more cannon fodder
<Bronysith> WHAT THE FLYING FEATHER is this the flinstones? http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/23033-your-argument-is-invalid
<Bronysith> Freefall29: thats why you say. "YEs. how about you come over sometime"
<Bronysith> being sarcastic
*VioletVanilla loves directly controlling the visualizer und changing colour tot he rhythm
<FairysHuff> But yes. Back to the weekly scheduled steam worms stream idea. Any mod interested in hosting it? And what does the community think?
<Freefall29> ok Bronysith ... I still think its not a good idea
<Bronysith> Freefall29: dude. it just pisses them off
<Kandarihu> Guys, we should be careful with classifying people as trolls. Expressing an unpopular view is not neccessarily trolling unless it can be proven the person doesn't actually believe what he's saying.
*Lil_B hugs VioletVanilla ;)
<HyperMetalLugia> Must be supahtr00
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Rain> Wait I just realized..
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: ty. like how i say i dont care for this day aria
<AgentKalim> True enough.
<VioletVanilla> 06Rain~ <3
*LadyCanary missed VioletVanilla <3
<owloysius> and he believes we're the ones making pony videos on youtube?
<Bronysith> Kandarihu: not a popular opinion but im not trolling
<Wrek> 05well Kandarihu: come into a brony site join the c hat and claim they should all die is pretty much trollin'
<LadyCanary> OMG RAIN! Rain!!!! <3

*Vordox hugs Vivi, and Shizuka as probably she's latching onto Vivi.
<Lil_B> whats the name of this song? It was on the last time but i forgot before i could search for it :(
<VioletVanilla> 06Kandarihu: Do they have it pulling from stereo mix?

<Kandarihu> This cat of mine. When my mom and I adopted her 6 years ago, she's been absurdly clingy. She just wants to be loved at all costs. And she's finally figured out the best way to get it. Just napping within arms reach of the guy who spends his life in front of the computer.
<Welsh_Pony> I would love to see a mario/sonic game that isn't a olympic game.
<Dark_of_Max> O_O
<Rex_Mundi> Dont have one... I dont have access to poniess except on Weekends. D:

<Meanwhile> Start stoppin Shamroc.
<Shamroc> oh god half hr add
<CriticKitten> Kandarihu: Sounds like my kitty. He visits me constantly and meows when it's time for me to give him lap space.
<Kandarihu> Everlasting_Joy: I'm sure you'll get what you pay for. And you'll pay for what you get.
<alexxm> his body is ready

<CriticKitten> Define reasonably priced.

<Meanwhile> Shamroc: Yer mum's the slag.

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sorry for the advertising >.(\
<owloysius> needs to be pink
<Everlasting_Joy> Kandarihu: Yeah, I'm sure.
<CriticKitten> Evidence seems to suggest that the Wii U will be a bit over $300.
<AJIsAwesome> ARE YOU JOKING ME? I JUST BOUGHT THE ORIGINAL 3DS!
<CrimsonPhoenix> AND WHY NO PURPLE
<Rex_Mundi> Im going to miss this chat. I dont like Jobcorps, i wanna AWOL out. I wonder if I will?
<FaithHeart> IT PROBABLY COSTS A LOT OF MONEY
<Welsh_Pony> Glad I didn't buy the first one. I will take this one
<FaithHeart> SO I WON'T BUY
<CriticKitten> Probably $350 or sommat.
<FaithHeart> WHAT?
<FaithHeart> ONLY $200?
<CrimsonPhoenix> AJIsAwesome, it's a bit useless really
<owloysius> just $199.99
<AJIsAwesome> NINTENDO, Y U SO STUPID?!
<Rainbow> WHAT IN EQUESTRIA IS THIS
<sagas[A]> 199 is much better than 300
<Sumica> 00,10that 3ds xl looks like a pain in the wrist.
<FaithHeart> True
<sagas[A]> they learned their lesson
<FaithHeart> bigger isn't always better
<Rainbow> What are we even watching?!
<sagas[A]> bigger is better
<CrimsonPhoenix> I enjoy the portability of my original 3ds enough
<Rex_Mundi> But how many bits is it? i hear the jaguar has 64 bits.
<owloysius> trailers, Rainbow
<Rainbow> HE IS SO UGLY
<SuperBrony64> 11,02O U
<CriticKitten> How will they manage a $200 price tag?
<owloysius> games?
<Lasharus> Christ this guy sounds boring.
<AJIsAwesome> Thanks, Nintendo, for making me waste so much money!
<owloysius> get the japanese branch
<CrimsonPhoenix> Lasharus, DON'T DISS REGGIE
<SuperBrony64> 11,02^
<Eztio--> ZZZZZZZzzzzz*pop* huh?
<Kandarihu> Gee. I remember when everyone was loving on this guy
<CrimsonPhoenix> His body just isn't ready
<Rainbow> He looks like a neanderthal. As smart as well.
<CrimsonPhoenix> right now
<turtlegod98> same shit in 2010
<CriticKitten> The reason the previous console did well is because it was sellable at a profit even for the original sticker price. They can't profit per unit sold at $200.
<Lasharus> Then let Reggie learn more than a single intonation CrimsonPhoenix.
<Fou_Lou> nintendo and his handhelds feels like milking the customers to me since the first DS
<Sumica> 00,10we make so much cash we buit a glassed off garden to look at
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64: inb4 you get an XL to replace(?) your 3DS

<ZappyTheUnicorn> Night GilDash
<SuperBrony64> 11,02When you're scanning the environment or looking at something in your inventory (i.e. the Wii U GamePad screen), the game still happens around you so you're at risk if a zombie comes up to you.
<Welsh_Pony> The queen is the final boss
<Meanwhile> I like the look of this game, then I realise it's for Wii U.

<Sumica> 00,10yeah it can Irish_Pony, but a better use of the under rail would be an m203
<CrimsonPhoenix> and gosh that game was awesome
<Bronysith> oh hey its the zelda ripp off sequel
<Rainbow> The zombie said HUUURRRRP
<Kandarihu> This game is supposed to be scary, right? Save files are a safety net. Take that away and ramp up the difficulty and you'd have a justifiably scared player.
<Vordox> wuut is this...?
<Tharthan> I don't.
<alexxm> mecha
<AgentKalim> Darksiders 2! YUS. I'm looking forward to this game.
<Meanwhile> Well, this looks interesting.

<Vordox> So where is GamepLay?
<CriticKitten> Well that's hilarious.
<Tharthan> I'm just saying that there are some people on this site who have been here as long as me.
<Custard> Hi CCCP :)
<Rainbow> DESTRUCTION AND MAYHEM MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA
<Lasharus> Wow. I hope we get to do that in gameplay.
<Skylands> 10Search may help you find what you need
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Oh look...Shadow of the Collusus

<Vordox> SuperBrony64: GoW, Castlevvania LoS, Raziel...yada yada yada
<SuperBrony64> 11,02In Technicolor :3
<Tharthan> I'll try. But my memory from when I was 8 is very vague in terms of random chats I had on the internet. xD
<Sumica> 00,10did you just refer to accicray being an issues with an m203?
<pony_132> This is not Shadow of The Colossus.
<Rainbow> JUST LIKE WITH YOUR MOM LAST NIGHT
<diddutz> is this a shadow of the colossos sequel?
<TrixieBaconMuffin> SuperBrony64: did you just copy my post ^^
<Vordox> SuperBrony64: Guess what, RAZIEL still kicks this guys arse.
<Sumica> 00,10You know the m203 is a grenade attachment yes Irish_Pony?
<junh1024-XD> how old ate these "latest peas"?

<Bronysith> god of war, zelda, prince of persia, and portal rip off
<SuperBrony64> 11,02TrixieBaconMuffin: No ;~;
<junh1024-XD> i get the feeling they're a few months old
<CCCP> What is wub?
<alexxm> so you play as death in this game
<Rainbow> what do sluts and hurricanes have in common?
<Skylands> 10Yes
<sub06905> -.-
<Vordox> Rainbow: They get you kicked?
<CCCP> Rainbow: they are both not trees
<Irish_Pony> Sumica: dah, M16 + ACOG + M203 = One Man Army :P
<CriticKitten> Pro-tip: If you have to name more than three games to state what it's a "rip-off" of, it's probably not that much of a rip-off.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02Who wants to see an annoying "gamer"?
<Vordox> Irish_Pony: You played too much COD
<junh1024-XD> or worse
<Eztio--> yes
<Skylands> 10Aurora admitted to forgetting about them
<Irish_Pony> Vordox: Nope
<Sumica> 00,10so how much rope should I give Rainbow?
<Meanwhile> SuperBrony64: We can see you already.
<Bronysith> SuperBrony64: thats me
<Meanwhile> Dohoho
<CCCP> SuperBrony64: so every gamer?
<AgentKalim> CriticKitten: Pretty much that, yeah.
<CriticKitten> Since original IPs are stupidly hard to come by, and unique gameplay even moreso.
<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64: yes
<SuperBrony64> 11,02:<
<MahBoi777> SuperBrony64: yes
<Bronysith> Meanwhile: silly its me
<Rainbow> CCCP: They both come wet and fierce, and when they leave, they take all of your stuff.
<Eztio--> SuperBrony64: can we see How to annoy?
*Meanwhile hugs SuperBrony64.
<Tharthan> ... I don't remember what my nickname was on this site before Articuno2, but it's possible that I was using "Tharthandorf" or some variation.
<CCCP> Rainbow: ha

<SaxyPretender> 0,14...she's cute.
<MahBoi777> ohai Pinkies4thWall
*SuperBrony64 hugs Meanwhile back ^-^
<CriticKitten> I have instant dislike of this girl.
<pony_132> SaxyPretender: Of course she is. She attracts dem male gamers...
<Sumica> 00,10Reminds me of that chick from Xplay back when she got the job
<Vordox> HOW IS SHE HOLDING IT?!
<Rainbow> YEAH PULL THAT ARROW ISN'T IT SO STIFF?
<twilight_sprinkler> woman game reporters make me think of AMAZEBALLS
<AJIsAwesome> She says "a bunch" when there are only 4.

<Meanwhile> She's got a lot of these guys coming at her.

<Meanwhile> Can we have her run over now?
<Rainbow> Overly excited, breaking fourth wall
<alexxm> so about darkstalkers one you played as war and in darkstalkers 2 it seems you play as death does this mean its going to be a 4 part series one game for each horseman
<twilight_sprinkler> what the hell is it anyway
<diddutz> thats like a "shoot arrow here" sign -.-
<Dark92Enigma> I'M Back..................
<CriticKitten> This is how you can tell the difference between a normal gamer and someone trying to act like one.
<Tharthan> I think I remember someone with a "Spectra the Rijolt", and some person who tried to wile his way through my name snatching shenanigans back then. Aside from that, I have no clue.

<Rainbow> TAP ALL OVER DAT SCREEN
<Sumica> 00,10well they are chargeing 200 for the 3ds XL
<CriticKitten> Nittany: No, they'd have to call it the "Wii ON U" to deserve a urine joke
<twilight_sprinkler> screw you dad
<Tharthan> I guess the only person I can know for sure has my chat logs from when I was 8, would be Articuno. I guess I'll ask for them when I have the chance.
<Rainbow> Urine trouble

<AJIsAwesome> "Comfortably"
<diddutz> are the trigger analog or digital?
<Bronysith> Did they record this on moonbase alpha?
<Lasharus> Why on earth are they advertising every single aspect to this thing that we all already know about?
<Meanwhile> Woop de doo, you made a controller with a screen in it.
<Rainbow> PULL DEM SHOULDER BUTTONS
<Dark92Enigma> FUCK THAT SHIT, This kid has BUBBLES!
<Dark92Enigma> FUCKING BUBBLES!
<Tharthan> P.S. They certainly wouldn't be anywhere on this modern version of the site, as the whole site was done over a few years back. I even had to re-register in 2006 :(

<Celes_Chere> Rumble + Motion sensitive. This will end well...
<Narolas> rumble + creativity of developers ? ... hmhmmmmmmmmm
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: Not their job to be creative with the tech, that's the game developer's job.

<AgentKalim> Taunt
<CriticKitten> It's not even supposed to be a competitive game. That line of thinking is precisely why they're screwing up the formula with the new one: to cater to you crazies who want SSB to be a Street Fighter or Tekken instead of a fun party game >_>

<Vordox> SaxyPretender: So how many Tournaments, INTERNATIONAL, have you played in? :P
<Yahooz> HE PERFECTED HIS LAST ROUND
<Yahooz> so much hype
<CriticKitten> I really hate the nonsense that SSB has to be designed to be competitive, instead of just, ya know, a fun game to goof off a few hours in.
<junh1024-XD> maybe your awards got deleted due to corrupted DB or something
<dalekkahn> Saxy, you just broke the first rule of fighting game club
<Reikim> Vordox: Funny thing, that. I assume you're talking about multiplayer fighters, because otherwise I'd point to Metroid, Legend of Zelda, etc...anyway, you don't need meta to become a classic.

<Splinter> Ive got Pc version
<Vordox> Reikim: Speed runs Mario 64, andd other games.
<CriticKitten> Because it's that same strand of broken logic that is producing a 2 player SSB. You "competitive" folks are getting your wish, so why aren't you happy? SSB will be "competitive", just like you wanted. >_>

<Tharthan> @junh1024-XD It's possible, as the whole entire site was SP@MM3D by the old lugia (not the one Articuno married.)
<Reikim> Vordox: That counts as meta? Wow. Learn something new every day, I guess.

<Tharthan> Really?
<Vordox> CriticKitten: True, but it didn't have stupid stuff(Tripping)
<Yahooz> He got banned from tourny play after Apex 2012
<CriticKitten> Throw a bunch of Nintendo characters in a game and let them kick each other's asses. It's not supposed to be a competitive fighter title.
<Skylands> 10Yes
<Vordox> SaxyPretender: New comers Meta. :P

<Vordox> CriticKitten: Yet Melee became a big hit for it's competativeness?
<Yahooz> Yes
<Yahooz> yes it does
<Yahooz> Its HUGE

<CriticKitten> It outsold Melee didn't it?
<twilight_sprinkler> noooo
<Tharthan> @Skylands Anyway, there was a Lugia that came before the Lugia that is called Lugia on this site, and he basically destroyed everything. That's why around 4-5 years ago, I had to re-register.

<Pinkies4thWall> SuperBrony64: i pre ordered for 50. :(
<SuperBrony64> 11,02This is an awesome game
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: It's a good game, and very popular.
<Tharthan> @Skylands Does he still visit this site?
<CriticKitten> Vordox: I'm pretty sure Brawl outsold Melee and has higher ratings. Your argument is invalid.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> For me this game got old fast =/
<Skylands> 10Not that I'm aware of
<Pinkies4thWall> still, this game is epic
<FaithHeart> Melee was better
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Oh, he's going to tear that argument apart...
<Meanwhile> Big gay thunder.
<AgentKalim> Big gay thunder
<twilight_sprinkler> well, at least derpy changes characters <.<
<FaithHeart> but it's almost impossible to find a copy of melee
<Meanwhile> AgentKalim: /)
<Tharthan> Hm...
<Vordox> CriticKitten: It outsold, so what?
<Yahooz> CriticKitten: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UByU09CORk
<Derpy_Hooves> derp
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> FaithHeart: Amazon... just saying
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Is Twilight the best movie ever?
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Titanic
<Pinkies4thWall> SQUEEKY
<CriticKitten> Reikim: With what? "It's my opinion that it's worse"? :p
<FaithHeart> lol suicide
<AgentKalim> Meanwhile: [===================\ Tactical extendible brohoof activated
<Meanwhile> >_>
<FaithHeart> not that suicide is funny
<twilight_sprinkler> Vordox: will geico save money on car insurance?
<FaithHeart> but in melee, it's funny
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Fanboys don't like it when sales figures are quoted.
<Sumica> 00,10PK choclate rain

<Irish_Pony> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m65159qr2s1rqlu5to1_1280.jpg
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Sales figures actually tend to enrage them further, because of this stigmata that "If it's Popular, it Sucks"
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lol
<Pinkies4thWall> KREENG
<CriticKitten> Vordox: I suppose that depends who you ask. But that's sort of besides the point, isn't it? You said the title wasn't popular, and sales figures are the best way to measure that.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Is Wii Fit the best controller ever, is Super Mario Bros 3 the best game ever? Is PSX the best console ever, is ....you see wher eI am going? Outsold has nothing to do with Quality of the game. NEVER mix those up, EVER
<Reikim> CriticKitten: See what I mean?
<CriticKitten> Vordox: You're the one confusing the two.
<FaithHeart> to the left of me is a bible
<AgentKalim> Big gay starstorm
<Vordox> CriticKitten: No, I have an eye for quality, not for quantity
<FaithHeart> can I preach the word of god to protect myself?
<CriticKitten> Vordox: You said "popular". Popularity is directly related to sales.
<sub06905> so close
<Vordox> I'd rather have a great arse game foor 10 hours, then a weak game for 100 hours.
<twilight_sprinkler> to the left of me is my phone, hmmm...
<CriticKitten> Brawl outsold Melee, ergo it was more popular.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Popular based on it's endurance of time
<Tharthan> Well, you're right Skylands, a lot has changed in 8 years.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Thereby connected to the quality of the gameplay.
<AgentKalim> To the left of me is either my cellphone, or my teacup
<CriticKitten> Vordox: That's not even a thing.
<sub06905> SuperBrony64: do the giant jigglypuff glitch :3
<Yahooz> CriticKitten: not competetively though.
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Although I do in fact agree on certain points. There are some crap games that have sold very well. On the other hand, popularity does not equal quality, which should have been the logical coutnerargument.
<FaithHeart> I played Melee almost every day in the cafeteria at college
<Meanwhile> Why are people arguing about brawl and melee?
<Vordox> FaithHeart: <3 Who didn't.
<Sumica> 00,10So basicly the only people safe is the guy with one of those plushies.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: If he had said "quality" I'd have been fine. He said "popularity".
<CriticKitten> :P
<FaithHeart> I was obsessed
<Sumica> 00,10You know the one i meen
<FaithHeart> and I kicked ass at playing Peach
<Rukario> !skylands
*Skylands belongs to HyperMetalLugia for eternity
<FaithHeart> well, technically Daisy

<Nittany_Discord> 11,01He hides in the slot.
<Skylands> 10!rukario
*Rukario now belongs to Skylands for 9 minutes
<CriticKitten> So tough shit, he's wrong. Brawl WAS more popular by virtue of sales. Its quality as a game is another story.
<Nick> @ Tharthan no he does not
<Rukario> noo oD:
<junh1024-XD> !nick
<ScriptBot> User error: Access denied.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: which plushie? the brony fanbase is both scary and cool
<Nick> oo
<CriticKitten> Use the right terms when arguing from a fan perspective. :p
<Nick> you are denied to me!
<Reikim> Sumica: Not that plushie!
<Sumica> 00,10the scarry ones
<Nick> I am invincible
<Skylands> 10You are Heavy
<Vordox> CriticKitten: IT WAS POPULAR BECASE OF MELEE
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Reikim> Can we stop arguing Brawl and Melee? :( I love both those games and I'd hate to be forced to choose...
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Sumica: well theres apparently two plushies now :'(
<Vordox> You're counterarguing yourself in the SAME sentance, CriticKitten ...
<Nick> Da
<Sumica> 00,10yes I know
<AgentKalim> Haha
<CriticKitten> Reikim: I wouldn't bother to choose. They're both good games.
<AgentKalim> that devil guy...
<Nick> VZZZZZT DADADADADAA BRRRRRR
<Irish_Pony> OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<CriticKitten> Vordox: No, you're contradicting yourself. You said Brawl wasn't as popular, which is wrong.
<Pinkies4thWall> Nice counter
<AgentKalim> every time I'm in an elevator, going up or down, and ALONE... I make those poining gestures like that devil guy does. True story. :P
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Sales = popularity? Not really. People might like it /then/, but hate it afterwards.
<PartyCannon> i liek SB streamz :3
<Derpy_Hooves> darn
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<CriticKitten> Vordox: What you MEANT was that Brawl isn't as good of a game, which is subjective.
<SuperBrony64> 11,02gg :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: ^
<Tharthan> @Nick Have you been here for 8 years as well?
<SuperBrony64> 11,02PartyCannon :D
<Irish_Pony> XD
<Derpy_Hooves> was trying to use star storm :3
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Lol
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Melee lasted for...well still, brawl was turned down within the first 2 year.
<AgentKalim> Mr. gayman watch
<sub06905> do giant jigglypuff glitch :3
<Celes_Chere> No, Gardevoir won >.> all hail Gardevoir!
<CriticKitten> Nittany: And that's what ratings are for. :p
<Vordox> CriticKitten: Check Super Smash scenes, those who play the game till even today
<Nick> not that long :P but I have been here for five
<alexxm> what is mr game and watch from
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ratings aren't too trustworthy now.
<Nick> but yeah I do know who that guy you mean is
<CriticKitten> Vordox: You're arguing a pointless point.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: take all my ^'s
<Vordox> CriticKitten: True, it is.
<Nick> I think I joined here in 2007 it was
<Tharthan> @Nick It stunk when he did that, man.
<PartyCannon> alexxm Game and Watch games
<Celes_Chere> alexxm: some of nintendos very frst games. Like early 80's
<twilight_sprinkler> sqoitle
<alexxm> thanks Celes_Chere
<Vordox> CriticKitten: But I am not backing down on this, cause I know I'm right, I own both brawl and Melee, and I still see people talking about Brawl being a good game, yeah it IS a good game, but nothing compared to what it's based on from Melee, which caused Brawl to become what it is today.
<FaithHeart> IVYSAUR
<diddutz> thats a big "map" for Smash bros...
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'd go with user reviews really (not metacritic bombings). Avoid major names since they could be padded reviews.
<Vordox> History, Analyze the fanbase, the forums ALL of it and see for yourself.
<FaithHeart> someone go pet the kitty
<CriticKitten> Vordox: Whether you liked Melee or Brawl is really irrelevant. The point I'm making is that it's folks like yourself, ranting about how "uncompetitive" Brawl was, that produced this new game in which the game is a 2-player competitive title.
<Nick> yeah well thats long in the past now
<Meanwhile> Fun fact, your argument is pointless.
<PartyCannon> This makes me want to play Earthbound so bad :3
<Tharthan> @Nick He blanked the whole goshdarn page and replaced it with something that I don't remember.
<CriticKitten> So you're getting exactly what you asked for.
<Derpy_Hooves> this was a bad decision on my part :3
<CriticKitten> At the cost of the party-based nature of the game.
<Vordox> CriticKitten: No, then it would be Melee.
<Tharthan> @Nick Yep. Just trying to be on a clean slate, since there was one fellow who did remember me.
<Yahooz> Vordox: Brawl would be Melee if Melee hadnt came out in the first place.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ugh.
*Yahooz shudders
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Arguing during a stream.
<PartyCannon> ^
<twilight_sprinkler> lol charizard cant even fly
<Custard> I'm having fun with some bots
<Reikim2> Okay, have we finished?
<CriticKitten> Nittany: SB's winning, nothing to cheer for.
<CriticKitten> :P
<Yahooz> Too bad my Wii is poop
<Reikim2> I'm rather annoyed right now that I don't have a working Brawl disc...
<Yahooz> i would be playing on stream
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> i hate chat derps 6_9
<CriticKitten> Vordox: No, what you asked for is a game that's more like Melee. So you're getting that.
<Celes_Chere> I never did like the stamina mechanic. It kinda makes you lose flexibility (Charizard getting tired, so you /have/ to switch to squirtle)
<Yahooz> ask Phase4 though, he knows exactly how good i am :3
<CriticKitten> You wanted a competitive title. Now you're getting one. So what's wrong?
<Phase4> suddenlyt
<Phase4> suddenly'
<Derpy_Hooves> this was my worst game yet x3
<Tharthan> So, are there any big changes to the chat system that I should be aware of?
<Reikim> Oh god we're still arguing
<Phase4> on yeah, Yahooz is baws at ssbb
<Meanwhile> Derptopus.
<Irish_Pony> xD

<FaithHeart> Togepi!
<Phase4> ohai DashWithRainbows
<Vordox> CriticKitten: How the buck do you get MELEE; 4 PLAYER FAMOUS Team Coop gaming competativeness, INTO a 2p 1v1 SCENARIO with the basis of Brawl into a competative Meta game tournament, YOU JUST DON'T WE had the game, WE WANT it bacl....
<Yahooz> Phase4: ty ^_^
<DashWithRainbows> Ohai tech boy 4.
<Nick> I wouldn't know not compared to back then D:
<CriticKitten> Vordox: You're getting exactly what you asked for: a competitive fighter
<hen3ry> Step 4.... I dunno, muffins or something?
<Vordox> CriticKitten: No we are not.
<twilight_sprinkler> gayyyyuuuuu
<CriticKitten> The four player part just "reduces the competitiveness", you see.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> ^
<Tharthan> The rules were: no spamming, no name stealing and (I think) no unnecessary pinging.
<MasterBoss43> Haii everypony, i'm back! :)
<FaithHeart> CHARIZARD, WHY CAN'T YOU FLY?
<CriticKitten> Since it's a competitive fighter and not a party game, right?
<Derpy_Hooves> gg
<SuperBrony64> 11,02gg :)
<Custard> Hi Masterboss43
<Yahooz> Brawl is competetive. Very competetive, in fact, almost as competetive as Melee, but the hype is not even close
<alexxm> hey MasterBoss43 hows your day been
<CriticKitten> So it should obviously be just two players to make sure it's competitive.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Hello MasterBoss43
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> FaithHeart: you fool Charizard is a dragon he cant fly... wait a minute
<FaithHeart> LOL
<PartyCannon> XD
<MasterBoss43> alexxm Good actually. :)
<Derpy_Hooves> that ended terribly x3
<FaithHeart> so why does he have wins?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> lol charizard clapping
<FaithHeart> if he can't fly?
<Vordox> CriticKitten: I give up, this is pointless, we won't back down, Your knowledge versus my knowledge, this is just getting me a headache on a high level.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> FaithHeart: Swag
*Nittany_Discord 11,01gives Derpy_Hooves a power boost with his feather duster.

<Ponies47> alexxm: So has it. Guess so.
<Ponies47> MasterBoss43: That was nasty. :s
<Reikim> Vordox: tl;dr allcaps is not the mark of good argumentation and is the equivalent of yelling louder than the other guy to prove you're right. Something I've tried to teach a lot of people - both IRL and on the Internet - to little success.
*Tharthan believes junh1024-XEF would like to learn fissure, but already has four moves. Would you like to delete a move to make room for Fissure?

<Ponies47> DerpyIsQueen: THE BUFFER SHOW! :)
<CriticKitten> It must have....
<CriticKitten> Midna.
<Reikim> Vordox: Flagrantly obvious, overused and all-around bad. True emphasis comes from the use of appropriate terms and organization of sentences, exactly as I did there.
<Bronysith> Ponies47: i would kill you if i didnt value my own life lol
<DerpyIsQueen> ZOMZ I LOVE DAT SHOW XD
<MasterBoss43> DerpyIsQueen: Where watching a black screen, just like 100 black people i mean..... (I am not racist)

<Meanwhile> MasterBoss43: Yeah, extreme close up edition.
*Ponies47 hugs rio
<CriticKitten> If Midna is a playable character in SSB U, I don't care what you do to the game.
<Bronysith> Ponies47: it was a quote from mib3
<Skylands> 10wat
<CriticKitten> I will buy it.
<Vordox> Alright
<Reikim> Vordox: Allcaps is not the only way to add vigour to your words. If you're writing well, then emphasis should come naturally to the sentence, as read in the reader's mind.
<Tharthan> Instead of granting +1 internet for lulz quotes, I believe one should grant experience points equal to or lesser than that quote.
<Meanwhile> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: Gonna chip in here and say Dark Souls sucks.
<Ponies47> Bronysith: Oh. You saw it to?
<rio> also i run a theater in my house so bad ass
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Meanwhile: no it doesnt
<Bronysith> Ponies47: it was good. boris the animal was hiloarious
<Reikim> Vordox: There's a reason why the majority of writers do not abuse the capslock key, and those that do are frowned upon as amateurs.
<DerpyIsQueen> Okay, here
<Tharthan> Typing all of it out,though... -_-
<MasterBoss43> Meanwhile At Ponies47: Yo get mah suit.
<junh1024-XEF> http://www.mazda.co.nz/why-zoom-zoom
<CriticKitten> No, I'm serious. I will forgive the sin of it being 2-player only. I'll forgive any sin it commits....if I get a playable roster with Midna on it.
<MasterBoss43> XD if you get it, used ur both names
<MasterBoss43> :D
<SuperBrony64> 11,02MasterBoss43: A letter? O.O
<Ponies47> Bronysith: IT'S JUST BORIS! But yeah it was good :)
<Vordox> Databse facts points that Brawl had a big fallout of their fanbase over the last few months, mostly being dropped within the full gaming scene with competative in focus, and mostly is a casual game that has no big reward for fighting games, Melee however still stand tough today in the most scenes, that I travel to atleast, and even have big tournaments, solo as well as team based combats.
*LunaTheBeloved pokes everypony
<Reikim> CriticKitten: My god yes. Also, a 2-player Smash Bros? On which concole?
<Vordox> That emphasis?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> TEXT WAAAAAALLL

*Tharthan faints from fatigue. There are no 8-Hour Energies left in Red's party... Red whited out.
<Ponies47> DAT WALL OF TEXT!
<MasterBoss43> I priv chat you SuperBony.
*Meanwhile steals LunaTheBeloved's leg.
<MasterBoss43> priv : Private
<DerpyIsQueen> Okay, here's the story: A buffer whell decided to take a stop to the ever black forest. He decided to enter the evernight forest because his girlfriend was cheating on TV static. The end.
<Reikim> Vordox: Link, references, and citation or it didn't happen.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Supposed the Wii U version they're making is 2-player only.
<xxMoopyxx> *Moopy has joined chat* hey guys i have calmed down with my parents
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Did SuperBrony64 get the letter J?
<Ponies47> Hey xxMoopyxx good. :)
<xxMoopyxx> eeyup
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: =/
<MasterBoss43> Nittany_Discord Yeah, from me. 6_9
<CriticKitten> Reikim: And I will forgive that sin, ghastly though it is, for Midna.
*LunaTheBeloved falls over
<Ponies47> xxMoopyxx: Just got back from seeing Men in Black 3 :)
<Vordox> Reikim: Smash Boards, international gaming scenes and stuff? Really?
<Reikim> CriticKitten: ...Nah, I can't support that. I mean, there's already option for two-player battles, and tag-team battles add another layer to strategy. Even for Midna (whom I love) cannot make up for that.
<Reikim> Vordox: No references, not truth.
<rio> anypony wanna help me with spreading love and TOLERENCE TO THE XBOX LIVE COMMUNITY PINKIE STYLE :O
*LunaTheBeloved crawls after Meanwhile
<CriticKitten> I will still buy it if I can has Midna.
<Ponies47> rio: Sorry. I have PS3 :p
<CriticKitten> Midna is the closest thing I'll get to a waifu. :p
<Vordox> Reikim: YOu don't see me picking up a dictionary for your explanation of words, right?
<rio> first game im spreading love to is MW3
<Reikim> Vordox: You should have.
<DerpyIsQueen> LOL, nice rio
<rio> starting out dangerious
<Reikim> Vordox: Besides, the situations are not comparable.
<Saturn> 08,01CriticKitten is mai waifu
<Ponies47> rio: Good luck! :)
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> rio: good for you... keep it away from Halo tho
<Vordox> Reikim: Urgh, do I have to...I'd rather trust a person then trust the internet itself.
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Well I got nothing to say, so goodnight everypony.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01rio: You mean troll and annoy them?
<DerpyIsQueen> After that I vote we spread love to GTA.
<Ponies47> Ohai Saturn :P
<CriticKitten> Bonus points if Midna plays like Oichi from Sengoku Basara, with shadowy hand attacks.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's not loving and tolerating them.
<CriticKitten> Saturn: Daw <3
<xxMoopyxx> Heh men in black i've seen that befor
<DerpyIsQueen> And not sex love -_-
<Reikim> Vordox: Hearsay is rarely accepted in law or science.
<Ponies47> trololololololol
<rio> no play songs and anyone who sends me hateful messages just respond in a nice calm and repectful manner
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Night everypony.
<Saturn> 08,01sex?
*Meanwhile hides in a tree.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Play songs to annoy them?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Nittany_Discord: to be a true troll on MW3 is be on PC and play MLP theme song all the time during matches
<Eztio--> what did i miss?
<CriticKitten> So yeah. I've crafted genius here.
<Ponies47> Night ZappyTheUnicorn :)
<Reikim> Vordox: You..have learned proper Internet research techniques, yes?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01That's not loving and tolerating.
<Reikim> Saturn: Not yet.
<RustyMeat> >joins chat to the saturn type sex
<CriticKitten> Midna, with a moveset straight out of Sengoku Basara. :|
<Saturn> 08,01what are you fokls watching?
<Vordox> Haha, Reik...
<Saturn> 08,01RustyMeat: you're the one with rusty meat
<xxMoopyxx> are you saying that your a dirty clopper?
<Vordox> Don't bring up law
<Vordox> Or rules, or justice.
<CriticKitten> Make this happen and ALL shall be forgiven.
<rio> OK then got any clue how else we can spread love and kindness to them?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: We're watching The Buffer Show
<ZappyTheUnicorn> Night Ponies47.
<RustyMeat> WHats that suppose to mean
<Ingwaz> a word to the wise for everypony, never ever play the pony drinking game while watching lesson zero
<junh1024-XEF> Tharthan|fainted zoom zoom is just Mazda's catchline/ad series
*Juliet reaches the base of the tree and looks around
<Vordox> Or anything that's based on a person view on facts that may be biased, unconditional OR even actual...damnit emphasis..
<rio> an ad hm i feel a video will appear
<Ingwaz> worst night/day that i can think of
<Tharthan|fainted> Ah.
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> rio: the best way to love and tolerate them... is to destroy MW3 for them
<CCCP> hi xxMoopyxx <3
<xxMoopyxx> hi
*Meanwhile drops a branch on LunaTheBeloved.
<CCCP> night Ponies47 <3
<Reikim> Vordox: I'm merely saying that I require proof of some kind. Pardon me if I don't trust the word of some person I don't know on a random chatroom.
<CriticKitten> ....huh
<Saturn> 08,01Buffer the Vampire Slayer?
<Meanwhile> ^
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Saturn: haha
<AgentKalim> ^^
*Juliet gets hit on the head
<Vordox> Reikim: Figured.
<Juliet> Ow!
<CriticKitten> You know, if Namco is making SSB Wii U....they could share some of THEIR cast of characters for the title too....
<Meanwhile> Buffer the Magic Dragon?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> its more of Buffer the Stream Slayer
<xxMoopyxx> Oh hey can someone stream something good for me really quick
*Juliet looks up and aims a rock at Meanwhile
<SpeedyBolt> Buffer Dash
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xxMoopyxx: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOvglodUIcA heres something funny and random
<SaxyPretender> 0,14CriticKitten,if that's the casem gimme Natsu please
<Tharthan> Is the chat room usually so quiet these days?
<Vordox> Reikim: I know what I know, that's my world.
<xxMoopyxx> ok
<SpeedyBolt> GIVE US PACMAN -shot-
*Meanwhile is hit in the chest and falls out of the tree.
<rio> i already did it with black ops with my other brony friends any msg i got i responded with love and tolerence here one for exp *U SUCK MY ^&$^ YOU NEED TO GROW UP YOU LITTLE $^$#@ AND STOP WATCHING MY LITTLE GAYONY
<Reikim> Vordox: I'm not waving away your point, not at all. I just refuse to take it as fact until I have my own information. I do respect that you likely have more experience than I at actual competitive gaming. And now is probably the best (and safest) time to break this apart and move on.
<CriticKitten> SaxyPretender: Bandai and Namco own a LOT of characters too.
<Espeon> it's pretty much either quiet or the opposite, not much inbetween :P
<CCCP> Text walls text walls everywhere
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> rio: lol sounds like me back then

<xxMoopyxx> Nope.avi
<rio> so yeah the community on black ops is not very kind
<SpeedyBolt> CCCP is right
<Vordox> Reikim: True
<Reikim> rio: You're playing multiplayer Black ops. You expected anything less.
<CCCP> SpeedyBolt: :3 yay
<Meanwhile> Owowowow...
*Juliet crawls over and steals her leg back and steals Meanwhile's
<Reikim> ?
<RustyMeat> lol CoD community
<Meanwhile> Nein!
<xxMoopyxx> we love my little ponies
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I would be okay with just many, many, MANY Soul Calibur characters in SSBWU
<rio> well a few times i started the theme and heard instantly BRO HOOF
*Meanwhile hurls a branch at Juliet's feet.
<CCCP> rio: the community on any call of duty game isn't very kind
*Juliet jumps over it
<Reikim> SaxyPretender: But then it would be a Soul Calibur game...
<SpeedyBolt> lol
<CriticKitten> Saxy: Like I said, if Midna's on the character roster, I don't care what they do with the game.
<SaxyPretender> 0,14I would be okay with that >.>
<Juliet> Na na na na Naaa naaaa
<CriticKitten> It'll be a day one buy.
*Meanwhile hand runs after Juliet.
<rio> not exactly everyone on call of duty one for PC accepted it
<Tharthan> I see... the chat room back in the day was like New York on a Sunday; though I live in Rhode Island, so I can't be certain.
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Which Midna? Adult!Midna, or Imp!Midna?
<xxMoopyxx> hey did you guys see the pinkie pie licous?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> yes
*Juliet takes off running
<CCCP> Im going to do that sing the call of
<CCCP> oops
<xxMoopyxx> i herd she was huffing and puffing in the background
<Tharthan> I wonder...
*Meanwhile cart wheels into Juliet's back with his leg stumps.
<HyperMetalLugia> Visit CHimera
<Reikim> xxMoopyxx: Yeah, she does.
<HyperMetalLugia> :p
<Irish_Pony> http://monopoly907.deviantart.com/#/d54sjq5
<rio> also any time i got the song SMILE SMILE one time everyone in a SEARCH and DESTROY EVERYONE SANG WITH IT
<CriticKitten> Reikim: My ideal model for a Midna character is a Zelda-esque character. Imp form uses shadowy hand attacks, or transform into the twilight princess and have shadow magic opposite of Zelda.
<Tharthan> Huh? It didn't work.
<xxMoopyxx> then she moved the camera
<Chimera> I'm in <censored>
<drf|away-HomePC> 02*WB03(Chimera03)02WB* - <Chimera> Meow
<Chimera> I mean Virginia
<Chimera> XD
<SpeedyBolt> Use her hand to throw around shit
<Reikim> CriticKitten: That would be nice. Still, I remain resolute: if they removed four-player support, I would refuse to buy the game.
*Juliet is knocked flat on her face and loses her grip Meanwhile's legs
<CriticKitten> Or I suppose you could do a transformation during Final Smash, like with Samus.
<SpeedyBolt> Hairhand is best hair
<Tharthan> @Chimera I was born in Virginia, but only because my parents were there temporarily.
<Ponies47> Annnnnd my computer froze. But anyways. YOU SILLY FILLIES! I'M NOT GOING TO BED :D
<CriticKitten> Either or. Both models work for me.
*Juliet watches as they fly towards the cliff edge
<rio> so what would happen if hasbro made an official fighinting game with all their IP'S?
<xxMoopyxx> hey sumica whats up man
<Ponies47> It's only 7:27 PM :p
<CriticKitten> Reikim: I dunno if I'd buy or not, in all seriousness. If it lacks four players, it's a lot less fun.
<SpeedyBolt> So is the stream ever gonna come back up?
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Especially since you could easily do a five player game. Gamepad plus four Wiimotes. >_>
<Ponies47> SpeedyBolt: Well duh :)
<Sumica> 00,10Very little atm
<rio> ponies47 you forget that everpony is some where else around the world
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ahh! It's water!
<Tharthan> @Chimera My mum still works for her physical therapy company based there, though. [Long distance management = pain in butt]
<Reikim> CriticKitten: I would buy that so quickly.
<CriticKitten> Hell, I'd like MORE players rather than less.
<SpeedyBolt> Oh ok :$
<xxMoopyxx> Hey ponies47
<Ponies47> rio: True but it's only 7:28 were I live :P
<CriticKitten> Gamepad, and then either Wiimote or 3DS connected play. Up to 8 players.
<CriticKitten> FUND IT much?
<rio> 8 28 for me see
<SpeedyBolt> My clock got screwed up earlier
<CCCP> The watusi, the twist Eldorado
<Ponies47> xxMoopyxx: That's me! Yes? :3
*Meanwhile watches awkwardly as his legs head off a cliff and elbow drops Juliet in the knee during the brief moment before his legs break on the ground.
<CriticKitten> Make things get downright insane.
<SpeedyBolt> Fixed
<Ponies47> rio: Yeah I know. :P
<Meanwhile> AAAAAH
<rio> WAIT I GOT IT SPREAD LOVE AND KINDESS TO DAYZ
<Juliet> AAAAAAH
*Meanwhile is out cold.
*Nittany_Discord 11,01plays
<Tharthan> Also, does Articuno have a problem if we leave our chat sessions open overnight, or will the server just time us out after a while?
*Juliet tries to stay conscious but loses
<xxMoopyxx> My mom was cleaning my room i was almost about to wild on her cause i was almost about to rage about 5 seconds
<rio> instead of killing everyone one WE BEFRIEND EVERYONE
<Irish_Pony> welp ill cyall later Im going to go play tf2
<MahBoi777> later Irish_Pony
<Custard> rio: Loving and tolerating to death
<rio> bye bye
<RyunosukeKnT> o/
<alexxm> bye Irish_Pony
<CriticKitten> The Wii U theoretically can support that many Wiimotes IIRC, and the 3DS is getting a connected play function with the Wii U title, so....why not go for TONS of players instead of two?
*Custard waves to Irish_Pony
<MahBoi777> mah mom just found a kitten and brought it home, it's nothing but bones and hasn't eaten yet:S
<rio> so anypony gonna get ZombiU :|
<Reikim> CriticKitten: I think there's an upper limit at some point. Maybe six.
<Ponies47> You know when I was at the movies I was gonna go into the lobby and walk around and say I WATCH MY LITTLE PONY! I'M A BRONY AND PROUD! Or just sing the MLP theme song outloud. I never got the chance :(
*Juliet slowly begins rolling towards the edge of the cliff
<xxMoopyxx> Heh
<CCCP> Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston
<Espeon> There's people who basically never disconnect from chat and that's not a problem
<Espeon> if that's what you mean, even x3
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Ponies47: I wouldn't have done that.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: It's more than four, I know that much, but I can't recall the upper limit.
<Tharthan> Yes.
<junh1024-XEF> i do dis^
<Tharthan> xD
<Vordox> I see 9 moderators.
<Vordox> no stream, I CALL HERESY
<Ponies47> xxMoopyxx: Ouch. I know that feal bro :S
<CCCP> 4 Brony hate crimes happen every year
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Some of us are busy.
<CriticKitten> Reikim: But assuming it's six, two gamepads and six Wiimotes (or one Wiimote swapped out for a 3DS). 8 players.
<alexxm> so do you guys think the playstation smash bros will be good
<Reikim> CriticKitten: I mean, an upper limit on how many are actually feasible in a game like that.
<rio> ponies47 i have a plan after bronycon after they all leave hack the montier in times square to play SMILE SMILE and well everyone do the HOKIE PONY
<xxMoopyxx> But my mom was organized my bedroom and she freakin organized stuff around my computer stuff
<CriticKitten> I think I've just struck genius.
<MahBoi777> alexxm: meh
<Tharthan> I wonder what would have happened if I left my session from 8 years ago open until now...
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: Meh. I'm very random. :P
*Tharthan ponders.
<Ponies47> rio: LOL! :D
<xxMoopyxx> and now it looks all straight in here in my bedroom
*Meanwhile idly grabs Juliet's arm in his sleep.
<rio> why does it keep telling me i need a program to run a stream?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> rio: you just might get tazed because of it
<Ponies47> xxMoopyxx: I like clean rooms. I cleaned mine a few weeks ago and it looks nice :)
<alexxm> xxMoopy mess it up
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01My brain needs food.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It is shutting down on me.
<alexxm> xxMoopyxx mess it up
<xxMoopyxx> shut up i didn't mess up my rom it looked dirty
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: EAT A BAGEL.
<Ponies47> Nittany_Discord: Quick! Get some food! :d
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> Meanwhile: O_O
<xxMoopyxx> i mean room
<rio> i know also it would be considerd an act of terrism and probly go above fedrial offence
<Ponies47> Meanwhile: LIKE A BOSS!
<alexxm> sorry xxMoopy
<CCCP> Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston
<CriticKitten> Reikim: I suppose, but I still support 8-player SSB.
<Meanwhile> Darkts3|Drawing|MLG: What.
<Reikim> CriticKitten: That might just BARELY be workable...I still think the upper limit is six, though.
<Ponies47> xxMoopyxx: Ah I see. Sorry :s
<CriticKitten> In terms of code or playability?
<rio> so anypony wanna guess the ep for season 3 when the CTC get thier cutie marks?
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> rio: meh
<Ponies47> rio: THEY NEVER WILL! MUHAHAHAHA!
<CriticKitten> The Wii U should be able to support that many, so it comes down to the playability for me. And I think you can make eight player brawls work.
<rio> well thats just uncalled for :'(
<xxMoopyxx> But heres a another thing my mom just figured out that i wiped my boogers all over the bean bag and they said if they see 1 more booger on there there going to kick me out of the house if i don't listen to there house rules god dang it
<Darkts3|Drawing|MLG> xxMoopyxx: wth
<Ponies47> rio: I'm sorry. I was joking. They will get there cutie marks sometime :(
<SaxyPretender> 0,14...
<rio> i gotta say first time i joined the chat ever and im allready used to it
<Ponies47> Ohai SaxyPretender :P

*Darkts3|Drawing|MLG slapped himself
<SaxyPretender> 0,14dun dun dun XD
<Reikim> Nittany_Discord: It wafts through the air lazily, drifting on air currents like it has no care...
<CriticKitten> Reikim: Oh well, I'd still be happy with six as well.
<rio> wait is it streaming something if so SON OF A COLT
<CriticKitten> Anything's better than two.
<Ponies47> SaxyPretender: Is there anything wrong with saying hi? :(
<Reikim> CriticKitten: Agreed.

<Phase4> from my play through of 1/3 of the quantum conundrum, i've discovered that its a little fidgity, jump is strange, and needs a little work. but the puzzles are portal quality and even the fidgity ones feel great to solve
<Kencolt> The proper spelling is kumquat. In other words, it's almost as silly to spell as to say.

<LordCelestia> 0,5Doing it excessively is very annoying and frowned upon (by me)
<rio> sorry i just do the ( for out of context chat
<Shizuka> 13only problem is bots don't understand plr
<Lunar_Brony> LordCelestia but we can still use /me if we don't spam the crap out of it, right?
