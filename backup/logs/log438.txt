<Aurora> 6I'm just gonna say this before the debate goes on longer
<Meanwhile> otakon: Oh I know right.
<drfsupercenter> 03Lighty, Apple's whole philosophy is to hide functionality from the user in order to make it "more friendly"
<IshBestSeapony> otakon x French
<drfsupercenter> 03but >less functionality
<Meanwhile> Omnomnom.

<Aurora> 6don't make me start
*Shane377 tickles PrincessLuna
<Suinide> Hmm
<Espeon> <Lighty> "Right of Free Speech =/= Right to be an arse" <- considering the situation this was hilariously ironically said.
*Espeon rolls

<Gunthler> Om: lol just accept it. :D
<Aurora> 6espeon, that was my thought exactly
<WallDives> PrincessLuna: ever get moar wine?
<Irish_Pony|Blind> Nittany_Discord i think you broke my brain
<Shane377> Nittany_Discord: have u realised that that spike is in the pet section?
<Om> ??? Muck Pup?
<Espeon> as he basically you know, did that. also the "lol lets say something bad before i leave as people might forget about it"
<PrincessLuna> WallDives: Of course!
<Aurora> 6at first I thought someone else had said it cuz of how it was worded
<WallDives> yay, me too!
<Espeon> I'll talk to him whenever I see him tbh
*PrincessLuna laughs at Shane377 's tickling
<GilDash> Om: You, slipping pizza all down yourself. Mucky... pup... ;)

<Hawksight> k
<junh1024-XD> NiS, i have heard numerous arguments for "we should go easy on him because of his age" AND "age is not an escuse to behave like an a$$"
<Om> GilDash: I just won't say anything anymore.

<Espeon> go easy on him because of his age hah no
<PrincessLuna> Om: Sorry!
<Svettponny> I just can't decide.
<Espeon> as he's really really proud of being so mature for his age and such
<BlueFlare> 02I never said you should
<Espeon> his own words btw
<drfsupercenter> 03yeah I remember that Espeon
<Irish_Pony|Blind> XD
<BlueFlare> 02oh
<Kandarihu> I just brought up Sea Pony Lyra on my own computer. Yes, it's the same set of assets.
<Om> PrincessLuna: Hugs don't make it better >>
<PrincessLuna> Captain Henesse...nice
<Espeon> and he usually actually does act more mature than I'd expect a 14yo to do
<Shane377> PrincessLuna: did u see the link i pinged u in
<PrincessLuna> Om: Of course they do!
<PrincessLuna> Shane377: Of course! xD
*GilDash hugs Om.
<Espeon> so my guess is that he had a bad day or something, still not acceptable what he did tho
<GilDash> Om: Hugs make everything better. :)
<Shane377> ur so cute in that
<Champion_of_Harmony> Lol
<Irish_Pony|Blind> xD
<Barbetos> If hugs don't make it better, some one is doing it wrong.

<diddutz> i hear a voice, but it's hard to understand, cuz it's quiet and quality seems to be bad Maid_Discord
<kenne> otakon: .15 cubic feet -_-
*LunaTheBeloved hugs otakon "Sure you don't..."
<otakon> kenne: it's mostly for cash and games man.
<Kyubree> 07but you asked for dolphin =P

<phobos2390> Ugh...I've got to debug a 1900 LOC Program. It's a nightmare.
<otakon> kenne: search around for a bigger one
<Glacymr> i asked for a dolphin... face
<Dken2021> otakon, you crazy french with your ships and your locks
<Glacymr> not an entire dolphin
<otakon> phobos2390: good luck

<otakon> Dken2021: I AM TRYING TO HELP OUT kenne dammit!

<CriticKitten> otakon: Dis thing: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/257527888/bronycon-the-documentary
<phobos2390> otakon: do you have experience with collision detection software?
<SunderlandPony89> Marx: Mind sending me another link to the livestream? I had to switch computers and lost it :(
<LunaTheBeloved> Bronysith, I saw, I'm just gonna read it tomorrow, I'd just like to relax and not really do anything tonight

<TheGir979> Kandarihu, Idk
<Glacymr> a face
<otakon> phobos2390: sorry man I do not.
<LittleBrony> For me being new on here I just wanted to ask...who is your favourite Pony?

<TheGir979> DJ PON-3
<Bronysith> okay LunaTheBeloved
<Dken2021> LittleBrony I kinda like Rarity
<phobos2390> LittleBrony: Fluttershy :[
<SunderlandPony89> otakon: Pretty good. Sick, but good other that that
<LittleBrony> phobos2390: Fluttershy is a boss
*Midnight_Tempest explodes
<otakon> kenne: dude, what can I say? it's either that or threaten your brother and his friends with viable bodily harm to dissaude them from taking your stuff illegaly
<kenne> otakon: lol
*otakon sweeps up Midnight_Tempest into a neat pile
<kenne> otakon: dem fancy words otakon
<CriticKitten> One donation of $10k, two of $2.5k, three at $1k....good god, where did people produce that kind of money? ._.
<AJTheMightyGamer> hey everypony!
<Midnight_Tempest> oooh... bodily harm? i got just the tools for that
<TheGir979> I freaking hate Mr. Garrison.
<otakon> Maid_Discord: just barely, I think your volume settings for the mike are off I think
<phobos2390> Hahaha.
<Glacymr> lol
*Glacymr turns HyperMetalLugia into a dolphin
<otakon> Midnight_Tempest: kenne's brother's friends apparently took some stuff from kenne's room. And his parents apparently can't do anything about it.
<SunderlandPony89> Hey AJTheMightyGamer
<phobos2390> Get me back in my body!
<otakon> hiya AJTheMightyGamer

<cilix> O_______________O logic
<LittleBrony> Another question only some will get, has anyone here every trolled true capitalist radio before?
<phobos2390> the game is a cheater
<CriticKitten> +14, -1, +25
<CriticKitten> XD
<TheGir979> no
<phobos2390> true capitalist radio?
<SunderlandPony89> LittleBrony: Nope
<TheGir979> KENNEH
<Tovler> I thought Ghost gave up… being what he was before.
<RainBroDash> 10g'night bronystaters, gonna play some SC2 and go to bed :3
<Skydroid> <( ' v )=>
<Midnight_Tempest> otakon: then all he kenne needs to do is take the stuff back and if his bro and friends try to do it again, hurt them... severely with a bat or large hammer... nothing says 'Dont Touch my Shit' like a few broken fingers
<SunderlandPony89> Night RainBroDash
<Skydroid> My dolphin.
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL what.
<Dken2021> hai RainBroDash, bai RainBroDash
<JetTheLatios> Oh
<JetTheLatios> I thought it was...
<TheGir979> KILL JOHN LENNING
<kenne> seeya RainBroDash
<JetTheLatios> Nevermind
<Skydroid> First part is head
<JetTheLatios> lol
<drfsupercenter> 03LOL
<LittleBrony> SunderlandPony89: Oh well I didn,t expect anyone to know what that is anyway.
<Skydroid> Last part is tail
<TheGir979> Lol Butters is awesome
<phobos2390> asdfmovie
<JetTheLatios> It looks like a fat bird
<SunderlandPony89> He's already dead TheGir979
<JetTheLatios> :3
<TheGir979> ..........
<CriticKitten> LittleBrony: Listened to recordings and I've watched a show or two live, but that's it.
<kenne> otakon: thing is i dont know which one of them took it or even currently has it
<Cypresswolf|> Who is this imposter Cypresswolf & why do they only show up when I refresh after chat crashes? O_o
<otakon> night RainBroDash
<LittleBrony> CriticKitten: Ghost is an asshole but we got to love and tolerate...
<TheGir979> LOL Butters can't kill him anyway then
<Midnight_Tempest> what was taken kenne?
<kenne> well that was meant for Midnight_Tempest but i guess it works both ways
<otakon> Cypresswolf|: it's caht derpying on you.
<SunderlandPony89> IT'S A SPAI Cypresswolf|
<kenne> Midnight_Tempest: a bunch of my games
<GhostDash47> mah mah mah
<phobos2390> go to the hub website...oops
<TheGir979> eh
<kenne> Midnight_Tempest: especially the ones i got for my birthday
<phobos2390> never mind
<CriticKitten> LittleBrony: Ghost's hilarious is what he is. Dude's obviously playing to his crowd and that's why it's become a "thing".
<Dken2021> who's ghost?
<Cypresswolf|> :) be right back
<LittleBrony> CriticKitten: Of course but what I don't understand is how he makes the can noise.
<phobos2390> I want to see the portal 2 campaign
<Skydroid> Actually
<SunderlandPony89> Dken2021: He's the host of an internet radio show who's infamous for being trolled in a segment where people can say whatever they want on the show for a few seconds
<Midnight_Tempest> kenne: hmm... the problem here is your parents apparently dont give a shit, so you have to make them give a shit or take matters into your own hands... violence is honestly never the answer, but it helps you get to the answer faster sometimes
<drfsupercenter> 03OK, so ... what
<LittleBrony> Dken2021: Ghost is a raido host who hates bronies.
<drfsupercenter> 03apparently Autodesk owns Pixlr?
<TheGir979> THE TALE OF SCROTIE MCBOOGERBALLS
<Skydroid> <( ' v )=<
<drfsupercenter> 03at least the Android app
<Changelingwolf> MYAH! At last I've taken over Cypresswolf's computer *twists mustache*
<otakon> TheGir979: that's old! Old ep is old
<CriticKitten> LittleBrony: I imagine he's got a sound byte.
<LittleBrony> Darkts33: He calls us 'over feminized fruit bowls'
<Dken2021> SunderlandPony89 you think being trolled all the time he'd be aware of it by now
<drfsupercenter> 03>pre-order Halo 4
<drfsupercenter> 03seriously?
<drfsupercenter> 03Halo 4?
<JetTheLatios> That makes it less fat :o
<kenne> Midnight_Tempest: lol, i really am thinking about it even though im the quietest and friendliest person youll ever meet, i have a lot of pent up agression over the years from all the bullshit ive ever taken
<Skydroid> Glacymr
<SunderlandPony89> Dken2021: He probably is. I'd be surprised if his reactions were geniune and not just him going along with being trolled to get viewers
<TheGir979> It's from 2010... It's not THAT old. Not as old as Cartman Gets An Anal Probe
<Glacymr> hi
<phobos2390> kenne: You're a fluttershy eh? :[
<SunderlandPony89> I SHOULD OF NEVER GONE ZIPLINING
<Skydroid> <( ' v ' )>
<CriticKitten> SunderlandPony89: He's playing along for sure.
<Changelingwolf> What's this? Whiskey? :D *evil laugh* He won't be needing this *smashes bottle*
<Glacymr> ehh
<Skydroid> Front face view of a dolphin
<kenne> phobos2390: i guess thats why i like fluttershy so much :I
<Glacymr> good enough :D
<CriticKitten> That's partially why it's so funny. The trolls get so damn creative with their trolling.
<SunderlandPony89> For example, you say moo to kenne and he gets irritated
<Glacymr> a lot better than junh1024-XD's
*Glacymr hides
<LittleBrony> Isn't flutter shy a peaceful pony? Then again I am not even on episode 20 of season 1 yet...
<Skydroid> <=( ^ v ^ )=>
<Midnight_Tempest> kenne: you could also take some of your brothers things and use it as leverage to get your stuff back... or if you really feel like being a jerk to them, and know that it was your bro's friends that took them, call the cops on them... theft is theft, no matter how small
<Skydroid> Hm
<Glacymr> why do the fins have = signs?
<Reikim> So I log in hoping I haven't been missing anything good, and lo and behold, they're streaming Portal 2...
<Skydroid> Since < > makes the dolphin have very small fins
<Skydroid> = extends it
<Glacymr> i suppose
<TheGir979> YOU'RE. GOING. TO. LOVE ME!!!!
<phobos2390> kenne: Saying moo to you gets you irritated?
<Glacymr> i ponder how it would look like without = signs though
<kenne> Midnight_Tempest: well i know if i take his shit hell take mine, and im pretty sure you cant prosecute someone if you have no proof they commited the crime
<phobos2390> theGir979: :[
<Glacymr> < ( ^ v ^ ) >
<Glacymr> oh
<SunderlandPony89> Dead chat is dead
<kenne> phobos2390: -_-
<Reikim> So...hello, everypony. Who is streaming this most excellent game?
<Skydroid> That looks better
<MahBoi777> don't sie!

<JetTheLatios> Sky's dolphin doesn't like to smile. :c
<HyperMetalLugia> <-( ^ v ^ )->
<Reikim> So this chat appears...well, dead.
<Midnight_Tempest> kenne: then your best option is just to kick some people's asses until you get your shit back... honestly, if i lived near you i would lend you my tonfas... that would solve the problem, very fast
<SunderlandPony89> Noooo internet, dont die on me
<MahBoi777> so moist and delicious
<Changelingwolf> :) I hear Cypress coming back...:) Bye Everypony *Evil Laugh*
<drfsupercenter> 03but dolphins don't smile
*drfsupercenter runs
<Skydroid> Jet, yeah it does?
<Reikim> So who's streaming?
<kenne> Midnight_Tempest: that plus i dont know if i actually have the guts to call the police... i have real problem with talking to people
<drfsupercenter> 03also why are we making dolphins
<HyperMetalLugia> <-( ^ (w) ^ )->
<HyperMetalLugia> ;D
<Skydroid> ^ ^ are happy eyes
<diddutz> Reikim: Nittany(Maid)_Discord is

<Skydroid> v is the snout
<Reikim> Midnight_Tempest: Um. Love and Tolerance?
<Bronysith> GNNIGHT EVERYPONYH and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL
<Glacymr> it's better than making TF2 characters
<kenne> Midnight_Tempest: i guess thats why i didnt really talk at all the first time i met otakon
<Reikim> Night Bronysith
<Skydroid> Or beak, like ^v^ bird
<MahBoi777> now now, let's not begin pulling knives on folks lol
<Gunthler> Bronysith: May the ponies be with you :d
<SunderlandPony89> Reikim: That's only toward poni haters. Everyone else is fair game
<drfsupercenter> 03<Glacymr> it's better than making TF2 characters <- true
<JetTheLatios> Oh lol
<HyperMetalLugia> <-( * (') * )->
<HyperMetalLugia> ;o
*Reikim begins an autopsy on the dead chat
<Midnight_Tempest> Reikim: love and tolerance can only go so far, steal mine or someone elses shit and i lay a smack down on some bitches
<Chimera> .
