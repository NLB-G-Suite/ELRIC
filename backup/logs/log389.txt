*Tovler wonders if fans of Downton Abbey are called Downton Abbots/Abbesses

<OneTrickPony> and then I can't spell gudzugoejnhfkd
<OneTrickPony> whatever
<Meanwhile> Like a baws.
<Meanwhile> Ty unfoundbug.
<Kammerjunk> That's why you should tell your parents that you're a brony.
<Kammerjunk> You know, give them time to accept the fact so that they'll let you go.
<Meanwhile> One does not simply go where they want at 12 years old.
<Snuffsis> one do if there are trains
<RaveBrony> :P
<Kammerjunk> "Come mothers and fathers all over this land, and don't criticise what you can't understand. Your sons and daughters are beyond your command."
<Meanwhile> Would you let your 12 year old go by themselves somewhere on a train?
<CupcakeWarrior> Trains? They still have those?
<Snuffsis> If they let me know about it in advance so i can check what it is and deem it safe enough, yea. :P
<Meanwhile> You're a bad parent.
<Meanwhile> Or would be. Theoretically.
<F1uttershy> hi everypony how are you all
<Tovler> Meanwhile: I would
<Kammerjunk> Yeah, I'm probably assuming the ability to judge accurately.
<Meanwhile> I am never having kids with either of you.
<Kammerjunk> Without any facts to back that up.
<Meanwhile> Allo F1uttershy
<Snuffsis> Meanwhile: when i was 12 i travelled by myself into the big city and stuff with my parents knowing, they didn't have a problem with it. :P
<Kammerjunk> L.O, F1uttershy.
<BronyinJapan> LOL i just notice that the other person name is Fluttershy and has a skin or it
<applejack096> Downloading minecraft 1st download wouldnt work just gonna refresh page mt streams stopped
<Meanwhile> I won't say you had bad parents because it'd be redundant.
<Snuffsis> I mean, if would do the research in this case, i'd get "Oh, he's going to a convention to meet other people who watch my little pony" . :P
<Tovler> I felt like a big kid riding the train by myself reading the schedule and whatnot
<Tovler> ah, Chicago
<September> So who
<Kammerjunk> Snuffsis: And if his parents are like so many others, they'd assume everyone there are pedophiles.
<September> Wso who's streaming?
<Kammerjunk> Which is laughable, really.
<Snuffsis> But then again, i live in Sweden where it's pretty safe to go anywhere. :P
<September> Snuffsis: I live in America where everyone is an obese ugly murderer. Well, almost here.
<Snuffsis> Kammerjunk: Hah, pedophiles? That is ridiculous
<Coolbluemidnite> Ooh its fluttershy
<Kammerjunk> I couldn't make this stuff up if I wanted to.
<Snuffsis> September: Sounds about right... :rolleyes: :D
<September> yeah lol. :D

<Tom> Episode 19 of season 2 "Putting Your Hoof Down" airs in 6 days, 1 hours, 17 minutes, 10 seconds (Mar 03 2012 18:00:00 GMT)
<Snuffsis> BronyinJapan, you there? Are there any Brony Meetups in Japan? :P
<BronyinJapan> dont think so
<Snuffsis> Too bad.
<CCCP> needs to be brony meetups in russia
<September> Fluttershy finally gets her sanity losing episode.
<SonicRainboom> Yay.
<Meanwhile> :[
<SonicRainboom> Meanwhile, I dub this castle Fort Friendship.
<BronyinJapan> How about making one CCCP?
<Snuffsis> Brony meet-up in Serbia, lets freeze to death! :D
<Tovler> an episode where Fluttershy confronts her hidden anger issues.
<September> CCCP: I feel there should be brony meetup conventions in all countries, linked through a series of webcams and representatives via Skype :P
<CCCP> im not in russia
<BronyinJapan> oh......
<CCCP> September: we should become a political party
<BronyinJapan> lolol
<SonicRainboom> Bronies run for presidency.
<Snuffsis> September: That would be pretty cool. :)
<September> CCCP: Hell. Yes.
<applejack096> Hi everypony im back!!
<SonicRainboom> Promises to reinstate derpy or severe fines on Itunes.
<Snuffsis> Would we be right or left-wing though?
<September> -Can't stop listening to "The Stars will aid in her escape PMV-
<CCCP> there would be world peace
<Snuffsis> And what are our goals.
<OneTrickPony> lol MLP will rule the world
<Meanwhile> Can't we destroy it instead?
<September> My first act as business would be
<September> Build a rainbow factory.
<RaveBrony> Lol o.o
<Snuffsis> :D
<CupcakeWarrior> NO!
<BronyinJapan> CCCP thatd be funny the 45th president of the United States Fluttershy
<September> With cupcakes.
<CCCP> lol
<September> Many cupcakes.
<Meanwhile> Where your fears and horrors come true.
<September> Meanwhile <3
<RaveBrony> ^
<Meanwhile> You aren't allowed to talk about Cupcakes.
<SonicRainboom> Our goals are to 1. Ensure the survival of the show for as long as the party stands 2. To create a new agency that will 'silence' any anti-pony complaints...
<Meanwhile> But I actually read Rainbow Factory like an hour ago.
<Snuffsis> 3. Revive Derpy?
<CupcakeWarrior> dat singing
<Meanwhile> I found it...obvious.
<September> ^^Sonic Rainboom: Can't do that. People will uprise for silence of speech. Hell would break loose.
<BronyinJapan> 4. World Peace
<emangamer> somone ping me
<Meanwhile> emangamer.
<Snuffsis> September: Easily solved, we'll also make bronies into a race, that way if they're hating on us, it will be a hatecrime. :P
<emangamer> damn...
<SonicRainboom> DICTATORSHIP, I SAY.
<Meanwhile> Why?
<CCCP> Snuffsis: lol
<SonicRainboom> Oh, that works too.
<emangamer> I cant get mIRC to make a noice when I get pinged
<September> Snuffsis: Very smart! What physical properties make us unique as a race though?
<SonicRainboom> Heil Friendship!
<Meanwhile> Gutted.
<Meanwhile> When was "Love and Tolerance" removed as our motto?
<Tarku> ohai emangamer
<SonicRainboom> When they removed Derpy.
<Meanwhile> Because in the short space of time since Derpy was altered we have really taken a dive.
<September> When they find diamond, who's gonna kill who?
<Snuffsis> September: We don't really need one do we? If we do, we could say that our races difference lies in our imagination and our acceptance and ability to love and tolerate.
<Dashie_Dashie> we share and we care September. :3
<Meanwhile> unfoundbug will probably kill them all.
<OneTrickPony> lol
<Dashie_Dashie> I'm the one in the fluttershy skin <3
<September> Jesus. Snuffsis that was an amazing reply.
<Jim> I'm RaggedyDoctor
<Meanwhile> Dashie_Dashie: O rly? What's the server IP?
<September> Difference inside..... Hm.
<September> Never woulda thunk it.
<BritishBrony> Hi Everypony.

<RaveBrony> G'day Ziltoidian

<SonicRainboom> Someone needs to put a sign so everyone will know the name of the fort.
<Snuffsis> It's Azas Arid Pack
<SonicRainboom> You sounded like Rarity for a second there, September.
<RaveBrony> Lol!
<Ziltoidian> So this a block mining simulator?
<Vinyl> So where watching wrek play minecraft, awesome
<September> SonicRainboom: Orly? Awesome. :D

<SonicRainboom> AJ's fine.
<BritishBrony> c:

<Vinyl> AJ is awesome
<September> I find AJ stereotypically southern. Which is kind of offensive to me since I AM in Alabama.
<RaveBrony> I still think :D should be created with this 'xD'
<SonicRainboom> She's just not Twilight Twilight or Rainbow Dash.
<SonicRainboom> ...
<BritishBrony> I agree, RaveBrony
<SonicRainboom> Why did I type twilight twice.
<RaveBrony> I want a more : D, smiley
<September> Because magic.

<Vinyl> Seems like an okay sotry
<MirrorImage> oh look, Human in Equestria

<SonicRainboom> He also wrote one where Harry Dresden goes to Equestria by accident.
<Snuffsis> She will hunt you down
<alexxm> any updates on if the derpy thing is just for the itunes version
<RaveBrony> Love all the accurate Fluttershy emoticons tho :P
<SonicRainboom> I agree, I'm not usually a fan of humans in Equestria, but that's just hilarious.
<MirrorImage> SonicRainboom - which one? there's two stories like that that i know of
<SonicRainboom> The one written by the same author of the story that's the new EQD post.
<Snuffsis> RaveBrony: What emoticons? :O

<MirrorImage> Creepers! Kill them! they're evil!
<SonicRainboom> Yes.
<SonicRainboom> There are creepers.
<CupcakeWarrior> How did he do that?
<MirrorImage> CupcakeWarrior - it's a Creative Mode Server
<Snuffsis> Nah, he's an admin so he can just type /gamemode 0/1
<CupcakeWarrior> boom
<Snuffsis> depending on if you want creative or not
<MirrorImage> that too
<BritishBrony> I say! The bally creepers are going to blow a preposterous hole in your jolly good fort! Disgraceful show, old chap.

<Snuffsis> :'(
<CCCP> there is no hope for derpy
<RaveBrony> oh god...
<Ingwaz> CCCP: thats not true, not only are we waiting on an official word, but deviantart user Kreoss who is an animator for the show said that in future episodes she would be "fine"
<CCCP> oh
<CupcakeWarrior> Kreoss might just be trolling
<CCCP> I really hope she is
<RaveBrony> Apparently its just iTunes and DVD's have her changed....
<kirzstryfe> 1,3good afternoon everypony :)
<RaveBrony> Torrent support material? :$
<Vinyl> Morning kirzstryfe
<RaveBrony> Hey kirzstryfe! :P
<CupcakeWarrior> Ohai kirzstryfe
<kirzstryfe> 1,3if you're talking about Derpy, the Friendship Express DVD has the original sequence still
<CCCP> i is it still in stock?
<RaveBrony> Really? :o
<kirzstryfe> 1,3comes out Tuesday
<Snuffsis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uuQpvf-88 :O
<Ingwaz> RaveBrony: i have yet to see an actual source to back up that the dvd will be changed as well, or an actual source that say shasbro will air the original version on tv still
<RaveBrony> I swear if i buy it and its changed, im gonna have a shit fit when i take it back :D
<Dashie_Dashie> Guize, do you like Wreks rendition of Helms Deep
<Dashie_Dashie> xD
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I have a copy of the dvd, it's the original
<RaveBrony> :o
<Ingwaz> kirzstryfe: how did you get a copy?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3and no, I can't say how I got it, but it was a legal way
<Ingwaz> Kmart?
<kirzstryfe> 1,3>.>
<Ziltoidian> kmart broke street date
<Ingwaz> lol
<RaveBrony> Lol :D
<Ingwaz> all the bronies now will charge to kmart!
<Snuffsis> Kwickie mart?
<Snuffsis> Isn't that from simpsons?
<RaveBrony> O.o
<kirzstryfe> 1,3technically, you're assuming the people programming the kmart registers are competent enough to set a street date on half the dvds
<kirzstryfe> 1,3they're not
<RaveBrony> lol!!!^
<CupcakeWarrior> mfw my Kmart is a block away from me
<Ingwaz> CupcakeWarrior: buy all the dvds?
<Snuffsis> C ya in a while then CupcakeWarrior. :P
<CCCP> bye CupcakeWarrior
<Snuffsis> Also, what is that mfw, what does it mean?
<CupcakeWarrior> Im not leaving
<kirzstryfe> 1,3comes in a 2 pack with the g3 movie
<CCCP> oh oops
<Ingwaz> i already pre-ordered mine from walmart, so i'm waiting until it should get here on march 5th
<Ingwaz> Snuffsis: my face when
<Ingwaz> it basically means :O
<Snuffsis> oh
<CupcakeWarrior> Am I the only one whos actually watching the stream?
<Ziltoidian> no I am
<Ingwaz> what is this stream you speak of?
<Snuffsis> Wrek, you should install MLPCraft. It's a client side mod turning everyone into ponies.
<RaveBrony> Im watching, but i dont have minecraft, so i dont understand it :(
<CupcakeWarrior> Same here
<BronyinJapan> im not reading fanfiction
<RaveBrony> How much is the DVD again?
<RaveBrony> O.o
<kirzstryfe> 1,3$10
<RaveBrony> Oh, ok :P
<CupcakeWarrior> I dont have any money right now:(
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I prefer Terraria myself
<RaveBrony> Same CupcakeWarrior...
<Snuffsis> For a gaming experience, i prefer terraria as well, but if i want to build stuff i choose minecraft.
<Ziltoidian> im eating hot dogs omnomnomnonm
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I start up terraria when I want to waste a couple of hours digging holes :)
<Tarku> i play both avidly kirzstryfe
<Ingwaz> minecraft sandbox mining game with rpg undertones, terraria = rpg game with sand box mining undertones
<Ingwaz> diggy diggy hole
<CupcakeWarrior> Whtas Terraria?
<ScootaChicken> hey everypony ^_^
<BritishBrony> Hi ScootaChicken
<Snuffsis> Kirzstryfe, want to see what i've started building in Terraria? :P
<kirzstryfe> 1,3*2D minecraft is the simplest way to put it
<kirzstryfe> 1,3sure
<ScootaChicken> methinks there's a small chance that BritishBrony is from the UK
<Ingwaz> CupcakeWarrior: its a lot like what 2-d minecraft would be if it involved heavy rpg elements instead of just sandbox building
<Ingwaz> ScootaChicken: you dont say?
<Jim> I had to hide in a hole during the night now, was too far away from the base to make it ^^
<Snuffsis> http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/468610754605559780/AD6991F8D7781FC3D304C61A08F50198E4497EFC/
<Snuffsis> Not really finished yet, but still, work in progress. :P
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hehe
<ScootaChicken> Ingwaz: not sure what made me think it, just got a small hunch
<kirzstryfe> 1,3you should add torches in the body, so it's lit up
<Ingwaz> Snuffsis: that is a weird looking, presumably rarity structure
<Snuffsis> Yea, it's Rarity, still not finished with the body, she's looking a bit lanky near the neck, and also no hair/eyes or cutey mark
<CupcakeWarrior> I would not have the patience to play this kind of game
<Snuffsis> I want to add torches to light it up, but it will look weird. So i'll just remove shading from the game when it's complete
<Ingwaz> terraria is a lot of fun, i've spent probably...40-50 hours on my most recent play through since i had to start over, so in total i've spent 143 hours
<kirzstryfe> 1,3when I start a new map, after I build a base I usually start on a massive hellevator
<kirzstryfe> 1,3current one will be the width of the screen, completely enclosed
<Snuffsis> Hahaha
<Snuffsis> I always make then 2 block wide, just enough to fall down through
<Ingwaz> kirzstryfe: i've never actually built a full helevator, always run in to water or something early on
<CupcakeWarrior> Hellevator?
<Ingwaz> i usually instead build extremely winding paths so that only i know how to navigate them
<kirzstryfe> 1,3you just have to dig around a little to get the water to drain to the side
<kirzstryfe> 1,3hellevator: massive hole you can drop straight down to the bottom of the map
<Ingwaz> CupcakeWarrior: a hellevator is a straight shaft all the way to the bottom of the world
<kirzstryfe> 1,3have a hellevator and a 3-platform section stretching half the map to fight the Wall of Flesh (one of the game's bosses)
<MirrorImage> kirzstryfe - are you talking the old 128-high map or one of the new 255-high maps?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01No, it's a quick way to China.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I think that one was on an older one
<MirrorImage> i mean your new one
<CupcakeWarrior> Does this game have bosses?
<MirrorImage> CupcakeWarrior - yes
<MirrorImage> there is an "end boss"
<kirzstryfe> 1,3I stopped playing for a while just before the big updates
<SonicRainboom> The Ender Dragon.
<applejack096> Wat is a IP for minecraft with u guys??
<MirrorImage> as for mini-bosses, not really
<kirzstryfe> 1,3new project is on one of the new maps
<SonicRainboom> Only boss in the game.
<applejack096> Hello?
<TOY_PON32> Owwww my head...
<emangamer> kirzstryfe: Y U SPAM UP CHAT
<kirzstryfe> 1,3:p
<TOY_PON32> What the hell happened last night?
*emangamer hugs kirzstryfe "why wub woo"
<alexxm> hey ScootaChicken thanks for saying hi
<emangamer> ScootaChicken is online?
<MirrorImage> so no one ever did answer me the past two days - what movies got picked for this week?

<CupcakeWarrior> The person was being annoying however
<Ingwaz> applejack096: chill on the caps, its a form of spam which is clearly in the rules
<TOY_PON32> Just Rarity
<Coolbluemidnite> rarity belle
<emantrollslayer> CCCP: no I think her first name is sweetie belle
<Ingwaz> oh, nvm, hes already gone
<ScootaChicken> I mean, it would be allcaps if the entire thing was in capital letters
<ScootaChicken> but it wasn't so...
<CCCP> but her sisters name is sweetie belle so her last name must be belle
<Snuffsis> Do not question your overlords!
<applejack096> :'( :P
<TOY_PON32> I think kirzstryfe scared applejack096 with that kick
<TOY_PON32> :D
*emantrollslayer hugs ScootaChicken

<ScootaChicken> which I find hilarious

<ScootaChicken> emantrollslayer: what, you mean like your incessant rule 34 posting anywhere that it isn't against the rules?
<CCCP> i said i would never go on /b/ but i really feel urged to
<ScootaChicken> because I don't think that mannerism is really suitable for anyone...

<ScootaChicken> I hurt poor wittle emantrollslayer's feelings
<Photon_Phoenix> <Gunthler> lolwutdafuq is rule 63 <-- someone somewhere will think a character is the opposite gender (I think
<Photon_Phoenix> )
<ScootaChicken> poor thing doesn't understand trolling
<Photon_Phoenix> but R63 is just switched gender pictures
<emantrollslayer> ScootaChicken: seriously, quit being a dick. its not endeering and its not funny.
<emantrollslayer> endearing*

<Maid_Discord> 00,01Nope.
<RoflBot> nope
<flutter_spin> no
<salvi> :( whyyyyyyyy
<TOY_PON3|Homework> Yes
<CCCP> Some one should wright a fan fic called 101 things you wanted to know about slumber parties but were to afraid to ask.
<AllTheGoodAtomsArgon> The trick to drawing is drawing everything you can from life. Start with still life like a lamp and look at the shadows and stuff. Don't think of it as drawing a lamp, think of it as drawing shapes. Once you start seeing things as shapes and nothing more, drawing gets easier.
<DaringDude> Of course not
<otakon> TOY_PON3|Homework: um, a bit yes.
<TOY_PON3|Homework> otakon: Really?
<TOY_PON3|Homework> I don't remember..
<alexxm> so how about mlp crossed with this http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109506/
<otakon> TOY_PON3|Homework: you were talking about trolling

<AllTheGoodAtomsArgon> It's for the absolute and utter beginner
<otakon> put up some nastiness
<TOY_PON3|Homework> Who's Sedrick?

<TOY_PON3|Homework> derpy needs to derp derp derp derp derp
<BronyCon> Hasbro UNDERPED derpy...
<AttackWithHugs> Pyrexo: Yeah. I don't know the whole story but apparently she didn't like how Derpy's original voice was either and brought up some valid points. I don't know the whole story but apparently people are taking it to heart and let's say that the messages they left her were not love and tolerance
<TheHoodyninja> Pyrexo: how u use italic?
<TOY_PON3|Homework> dat wall of text
<AppleEric> you are going to LOVE ME in bed
<TOY_PON3|Homework> No!
<LadyCanary> Oh dang. And...oh my..

<TOY_PON3|Homework> one does not simply call upon dari
<Cole> Pomf in my bed.
<Matt> Wats not gonna work?
<otakon> no pomf
<AttackWithHugs> I don't think it's offensive. There were some parents that thought it was offensive because it made fun of handicapped people, but some bronies were complaining of the very same thing.
<otakon> hmm nothing
<LadyCanary> Matt, dont tempt dari.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3all the pomf
*LadyCanary noms kirzstryfe :3

<Gunthler> lol kyrospawn
<LadyCanary> D: Why so bleh dearest Shizuka
<AttackWithHugs> So now, because of this, Hasbro edited Derpy and everyone's having a fit at Yamino for expressing her opinion of it, yet nobody is doing the same at these parents or bronies who did it.
<Shizuka> 13bleh.....
<Aircrafter> Hello Everybody.
<otakon> AttackWithHugs: I think it's offensive now, they felt they needed to change it. So remember kids, if you don't like how someone sounds or looks just because, it's okay to try and change them
*LadyCanary hugs Shizuka. Whatever it is, it will get better. I know it.
<TOY_PON3|Homework> Derpy is so offensive that even I was offended by the derp

<TOY_PON3|Homework> no not like that
*Paradise92 uses the Royal Canterlot Voice
<LadyCanary> I know, but you shouldnt tell someone to do that
<AttackWithHugs> otakon: I loved her original voice. It was so adorable to hear it that I squee'd. But apparently it's wrong because I read one of the coments left on Yamino's dA saying that thir little cousin/brother who was disabled didn't like the show anymore because he thought the other ponies were making fun of Derpy.
<Paradise92> HELLO EVERYPONY!
<otakon> hiya Paradise92
<LadyCanary> Hii Paradise92
<Jim> hi Paradise92
<TOY_PON3|Homework> LadyCanary: Ain't I a stinker? :P

<TOY_PON3|Homework> type in letter, then keep doing it rapidly
<Aircrafter> Wait..they're doing something with derpy's voice?
*Scoot-Scootaloo hugs LadyCanaru back
<Sky_Pirate_Brony_> AttackWithHugs I didn't like her first voice, but I did love her. And it had it's charm about it. They need to Derp up her new voice, and it'll be perfect.
<Aircrafter> What are they doing too poor DERPY?
<GabeMoist> GENTLEMEN
<otakon> AttackWithHugs: eh, no worries. and Yamino should have explained the other ponies WEREN'T making fun of Derpy
<TheHoodyninja> Seriously how u use italics

<Matt> h
<Matt> hg
<Matt> hgf
<Matt> hgfd
<otakon> Aircrafter: completely edited her debut scene on iTunes. No name is mentioned, her eyes are underped and her voice is now a vapid imitation

<Kammerjunk> Am I really the only one who thinks such?
<GabeMoist> lol
<otakon> GODDAMNITDARIBOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<AttackWithHugs> otakon: Yamino should have but everyone's entitiled to their opinion and you can't change what people think, unfortunately. You can try to persuade but that's probably as close as you can get.
<flutter_spin> Who was it that said she sounded more like a dumb blonde with the weird voice? That was my thought too.
<Kammerjunk> I guess I am.
<GabeMoist> Ohai MattSmith
<Cole> Ready to Refresh?
<MattSmith01> Hey TOY_PON3 That was not nice!

<Paradise92> and what?
<Cole> GO!
<otakon> AttackWithHugs: agreed, and I like her work too. I just thought all the hate must not be from her or she had at least a good reason to say what she said.
<Sky_Pirate_Brony_> flutter_spin that's something someone brought up. That the old name Ditzy Doo was more offensive, as a blond pony named ditzy?
<TheHoodyninja> imma get off and do some sh*squee* look me up on xbox live when you get the chance. Gamertag is xXSilveR SoleDXx

<MattSmith01> who left??
<emangamer> man guys, that new episode today was AMAZING...it had a great story and great character development the best song of the series, and was so bucking funny
<Jaketehsnake> OOoooh, do I smell VIDEO GAMES?
<TOY_PON3|Homework> prince-dari left
<MattSmithBestDoctor> Is dari here?
<Jaketehsnake> emangamer OH U
<MattSmith01> o
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> flutter_spin The original VA didn't know Derpy was a girl.
<otakon> emangamer: indeed, oh u!
<TOY_PON3|Homework> two Matt Smiths?! holy shit
<LadyCanary> ._.
<MattSmith01> Im Matt Smith loser!!
<alexxm> i take it there isn't a stream
<LadyCanary> Guys, really, dont do that.
<otakon> Sky_Pirate_Brony: yh, but it was still endearing
<dude687> hey were is the radio?
<TOY_PON3|Homework> that MattSmith01 is a spy!
<otakon> alexxm: enope, not atm
<flutter_spin> yeah I know. But it now makes it double derped. More character :P
<otakon> LadyCanary: do what?
<MattSmith01> No im no!
<LadyCanary> The whole Matt Smith thing.
<AttackWithHugs> otakon: Everybody's going from what they read in a Tumblr post she made, and that's why she's getting all these death threats and hate. Not everyone displeased were doing that but it was a majority. It almost shames me to be a brony because now people who were considering the show are probably not going to watch it all because some immature people don't know how to express their feelings in a civilized manner.
<MattSmithBestDoctor> Why?
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> otakon True enough...I just thought ti'd be better as a female. The new voice is cuter, just needs more derp.
<flutter_spin> How many times have we heard characters like bonbon sound wrong
<Jaketehsnake> Anypony up for videogames? Lack of stream means gaming time.
<TOY_PON3|Homework> LadyCanary: Matt Smith needs to Matt Smith Matt Smith because Matt Smith is Matt Smith ya know?
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Jaketehsnake depens on the console
<alexxm> ok are they any famous people who are bronies
<Sky_Pirate_Brony> Jaketehsnake PC or PS3
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03I prefer Matt Groening
<AttackWithHugs> otakon: Hell, even Keross (I think I spelled that wrong) said that Yamino had nothing to do with the chanve.
<Jaketehsnake> I will alwasys remember "I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG
<AttackWithHugs> change*
<emangamer> Scoot-Scootaloo O U
<MattSmithBestDoctor> Matt Smith is a brony
<Jaketehsnake> I prefer PC
<flutter_spin> BonBon: "Mine has rocks in it" is the best out-of-place sound ever
<Jaketehsnake> As I am without PS3
<otakon> flutter_spin: Bon bon is bon bon, and we take that as just plain fun.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03oh hey emangamer!

You, you, you gotta put it in here and rinse it off and start all over again and, and sometimes, sometimes life sticks to the floor so bad you know a mop, a mop, it's not good enough, it's not good
<GabeMoist> enough. You, you gotta get down there, like, with a toothbrush, you know, and you gotta, you gotta really scrub 'cause you gotta get it off. You gotta really try to get it off. But if that doesn't work, that doesn't work, you can't give up. You gotta, you gotta stand right up. You, you gotta run to a window and say, "Hey!

<dr-whooves> ^
<Jaketehsnake> If this was a big room IRL people would call you all pedophiles
<dr-whooves> ^
<Pinkies4thWall> Q: How old are the ponies?The ponies' ages were left intentionally undefined. I like to think of them as having maturity levels anywhere between 12 and 18, (but remember that maturity is different than age. You can be a 10-year-old with the maturity of a 15-year-old, and you can be a 35-year-old with the maturity of a 15-year-old.) For story telling purposes, they needed to be able to live independent of parents, but innocent en
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that can be right after all your are the Dr.
<kirzstryfe> 1,3how old are you unfoundbug?

<Jaketehsnake> You don't have to BE a pedophile for parents to call you one. Anypony who isnt the same age as their child and talks to them is a "pedophile" Otakon
<Meanwhile> Anyway, reason you might find my age amusing otakon is because my birthday is the 13th.

<RAWRity> Christian Bale here to lend creedence to this farce of a presentation.
<Dark_Horst> TOY_PON3: you rate dead space scarie than amnesia?
<owlicious> AAAAAAW
<Meanwhile> Dead Space is just an fps with some really ugly bad guys that have a habit of suddenly appearing from vents.
<CCCP> PinkiePieCopy: lol
<flutter_spin> Amnesia is exploring the unknown. When there is light and a weapon, you usually know what to expect
<Yahooz> lol double name ref
