<FauxShot> Hi! :)
<Moshakra> Epic Movie is a 2007 American parody film directed and written by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer and produced by Paul Schiff. It was made in a similar style to Date Movie, Friedberg and Seltzer's previous film. The film mostly references The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Tim Burton's version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The song "Ms. New Booty" by Bubba Sparxxx gained commercial attention

<Moshakra> Epic Movie is a 2007 American parody film directed and written by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer and produced by Paul Schiff. It was made in a similar style to Date Movie, Friedberg and Seltzer's previous film. The film mostly references The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Tim Burton's version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The song "Ms. New Booty" by Bubba Sparxxx gained commercial attention

<Saturn> 8,1pony_7129: absolutely nothing.
<CheshireKitten> I like how this movie boils down to pure theft of good material from good movies, slapped together with duc tape and paste, and its only original jokes are jokes intended for a very immature audience. >_>

<TOY_PON3> The best scene is the credits
<Sebiale> Not Epic Movie!
<Meanwhile> Can't wait.
<K_A> Quit ripping off Twilight Sparkle, chicken guy.

<AnonQ> Great, now that I'm high enough to actually watch that movie, the movie's over?
<K_A> TBF, I'm thinking this is a server-level hack due to the redirect.
<prince-dari> You mad because this film is so much better than anything you've ever done with your life.
<klopki> 8.5/10

<Ghosties> 04Yep, I'm so mad
<Lasharus> If you want me to put my rating into words, I think the best way to describe it would be that gouging my own eyes out with a rusty screwdriver would probably rate rather higher on the personal amusement scale.
<StinkomanFan> I will never get those moobs out of my brain
<klobb> Only ponies can save us now.

<Atzel> "Some guy tried hacking fimfiction. The site is down while we figure out if anything bad happened. (The redirection to 0au.de was because that's the default site for this server; sorry about that."
<AnonyPony-EQD> Lets just burn down discords house
<prince-dari> Blazing Saddles is shit too
<not_a_cannibal> leave the chat and come back under the same username

<Amras0000> it felt like 10
<otakon> prince-dari: Blazing Saddles was funny, and so was Mel Brooks
<PromissaFidel> good night!
<Tasorow> Mel Brooks is a boss!
<Fleur> WMC my ass. You want a WMC worty movie? I will start voting for it from now untill it wins and you will regret it
<Kencolt> The only thing that makes Plan 9 a technically worse movie was that the writer-director-producer was sincerely trying to make a "Proper" film.
<Princess_Luna> Goodnight my fan!
<RainbowKitten> :o
<MI9000> hey if anyone has direct tv i know you can watch mlp fim on the hub 294 so show your support ffor the show

<[SWAG]GabeMoist> never again
<Discord> im sure this movie made us all get therapies :)
<WhirlSquirrel> Black Screen > Blue Sceen
<prince-dari> Blazing Saddles was boring and lacked in ANY kind of humour.
<Atzel> that's what the fimfiction site says
<Quin> worst movie ever
<K_A> I'm ambivalent. I can see why this movie would be "geniusly bad" or "plain horrid."
<Spazturtle> good night everypony
<Fleur> you will all learn what real rage is
<prince-dari> Idiotic or intelligent
<Amras0000> absolutely

<Everlasting_Joy> Too late for you guys StinkomanFan and Lasharus?
<RainbowKitten> :D <3 :o
<ZAFT_Pony> Ponies, finally!
<Al> You can't ignore Gene Wilder
<Miller> and the Cake twins' episode counted for nothing?
<BioBeats> Fluttershy is The BEST
<xXapplejackdanielsXx> :D
<null> Even though I normally don't like it much
<Iweywrt> eeyup
<BronyTJ> epic movie should be WMC'D
<Colt_of_Personality> Ashleigh Ball
<RainbowKitten> NOT!
<Ghosties> 04It was created during the showing of Babes In Toyland, the original winner of that prize
<naahdude> It's more that the character development for Rainbow Dash in this season basically portrays her as a jerk
<AnonQ> I say EEYUP all day, erry day.
<Dapperjack> I want more scoots, actually
<BronyCon> Ash is best
<Lasharus> It's only 4:45 AM Everlasting_Joy. :p

<Dapperjack> where's the scoots ep?
<Fenr> babes in toyland.. *shivers*
<MrDrProfIshBestPony> All Seltzer and Friedburg films should be WMC
<Tovler> The comedy actually flowed naturally in Blazing Saddles and never missed a beat, The jokes were NEVER explained, unlike Epic Movie.
<RaveBrony> I say Eeyup wheneever I can! But nopony understands where its from :(
<xXapplejackdanielsXx> alzheimers is best pony
