<OtakuTom> pony_3926: RealMyst
<pony_3926> Ah okay. Thanks
<OtakuTom> It's a remake of the original Myst, but with free movement instead of point-and-click
<scottish-geeky> Om: thaer we go http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4857/
<Om> scottish-geeky: Octavia face hoof? Whatever for?
<scottish-geeky> Om: idk'

<Om> scottish-geeky: Sleep, eh? Scogetly?
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> dafuq is dis shit
<OtakuTom> JRP2234: This is one of my all-time favorite games. It really requires a lot of thought to beat the first time you play it (as long as you don't use a walkthrough or anything like that)
<cow334> Hello every one :)
<OtakuTom> Hey Cow334
<doughnutjoe> o hai bronystate
<doughnutjoe> im back
<OtakuTom> Hey doughnutjoe
<doughnutjoe> hi
<doughnutjoe> What are we playing today?
<OtakuTom> Phase4 is playing RealMyst
<cow334> Hello every one how are you all
<doughnutjoe> hi cow334
<Phase4> 00,02soo much word
<Phase4> 00,02i'm sure this game is epic interesting and i should read all this
<cow334> hai doughnutjoe
<Phase4> 00,02but its soo much
<Phase4> 00,02and i want to be solving puzles
<doughnutjoe> Twilight Sparkle would like this game lawl
<OtakuTom> A lot of it is backstory to areas you'll visit later in the game, while some other parts of it (mainly the diagrams) will help out with puzzles.
<cow334> Phase4: mabey you should read it when like you are getting into the game
<Phase4> 00,02i figure some of this is for puzles
<cow334> Phase4: Stragtey game I'm guessing then?
<doughnutjoe> Shit that's alot of reading
<OtakuTom> Adventure/puzzle, cow334
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, not a clue
<doughnutjoe> How many books do you have to read?
<OtakuTom> Technically, you don't have to actually read any of them. Most of the books are burned, anyway.
<OtakuTom> There's only like 5 or 6 books in the library there that are intact.
<cow334> OtakuTom: oh thanks
<doughnutjoe> Why are they burned?
<OtakuTom> It's part of the story
<cow334> Phase4: hmmm so you bought a game and you dont even know what the plat form is
<cow334> lawl
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, i've been told for a long time its good
<Phase4> 00,02Shizuka recomended it
<Phase4> 00,02must be something here
<cow334> Phase4: It looks good but it also looks confuesing at the same time
<Phase4> 00,02i am intrigued, but its a little much right now
<Phase4> 00,02yeah
<doughnutjoe> Is there enemies?
<OtakuTom> I said it a little earlier...this is one of my all-time favorite games. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good thinking game.
<OtakuTom> There's no enemies.
<OtakuTom> No time limit
<cow334> Phase4: can you please tell me what the game is called
<Phase4> 00,02realMyst
<OtakuTom> cow334: It's called Myst. The version Phase is playing is called realMyst
<doughnutjoe> Is this game on ps3?
<OtakuTom> The original game came out in 1993 for PC CD-ROM
<cow334> OtakuTom: wow even the name sounds confuesing
<doughnutjoe> pc only?
<OtakuTom> It's been remade a number of times, including for handhelds.
<OtakuTom> There's no major console release (PS3, 360)
<cow334> Is there any enemys on the game
<doughnutjoe> no
<OtakuTom> There's no enemies. It's just you and the puzzles.
<doughnutjoe> So whats the story?
<doughnutjoe> Trying to find treasure?
<OtakuTom> Your character comes across a book with the title 'Myst'. Inside the book is a moving picture. When you put your hand on the picture, you are transported to this island.
<Bronysith> HIYA EVERYPONY WAKE UP
<doughnutjoe> So your trying to escape the island?
<doughnutjoe> Hi Bronysithj
<cow334> Phase4: from what u have just read about this game it has a HUGE history of versions and it looks real confuesing if you want to get into of this game you need to like no what is going on
<OtakuTom> From there, you have to discover the secrets behind the island, the writer of the Myst book, named Atrus, and his 2 sons, Sirrus and Achenar
<cow334> Phase4: sorry i meant from what i just read
*Bronysith glomps Phase4
*Phase4 00,02hugs Bronysith back
<Phase4> 00,02stream working ok?
<cow334> hai Bronysith
<cow334> How are you tofay
<OtakuTom> The stream's been cutting in and out a little bit, but it's stable now.
<doughnutjoe> Did you guys see the video about the guys threatining to kill a guy if there is no summer sale?
<Bronysith> cow334: im good
<Phase4> 00,02i have no clue if these levers do anything
<cow334> Bronysith: awesome
<Phase4> 00,02doughnutjoe, lolwut
<doughnutjoe> Phase4 idk if it's fake or not
<OtakuTom> Everything you can interact with on the island is there for a reason. You need to figure out what they do.
<cow334> doughnutjoe: lawl
<doughnutjoe> I saw it on reddit
<cow334> I'll be right bacl
<cow334> back
<doughnutjoe> im the only one who saw it?
<doughnutjoe> ok then...
<OtakuTom> The tower rotation doesn't do anything for being able to access certain things. It will, however, give you clues as to the 4 locations it points to where the lines turn red.
<doughnutjoe> OtakuTom Did you already beat this game?
<OtakuTom> Years ago. I've had Myst since it first came out back in 1993.
<doughnutjoe> wow
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4:
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> l4d2 should work now
<Phase4> 00,02i'm playing myst
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> NO

<Phase4> 00,02??????????????????
<doughnutjoe> Is...is that a rocket ship?
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: make a program that turns the text here in to mssam voice
<doughnutjoe> [wklmjhe]JRP2234 LFD1 is better
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: ill give you cake
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> i dont has l4d1
<OtakuTom> Phase4: Do you want to know the secret to the elevator in the library?
<doughnutjoe> [wklmjhe]JRP2234 Buy it
<doughnutjoe> [wklmjhe]JRP2234 it's FUN!
<OtakuTom> It won't ruin anything else other than how to access more clues.
<doughnutjoe> :D
<doughnutjoe> Try 1337
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> i got it from new zealand to avoid the nerfed version
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, nope
<doughnutjoe> ima go watch Ashens now
<doughnutjoe> bye!
<Om> Oh look a dentist chair, I'll just sit in it.
<BrOnyxia> hey there
<OtakuTom> Hey BrOnyxia

<Phase4> 00,02BrOnyxia, realMyst
<OtakuTom> I hate to break it to you, but that's not the imager...
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, well that sucks
<BrOnyxia> Phase4: ic thx
<Om> Whatever it is, it was cool.
<BrOnyxia> my name is purple in his chat
<BrOnyxia> lol
<Tovler> ugh, what a terrible dream.
<BrOnyxia> ;o?
<Tovler> I dreamt that I didn't get a newsletter email.
<Chrysalis> buwah, my OC re-colouring got added as a favourite by someone?
<BrOnyxia> my worst dream was when i ordered the rd t-shirt .. i dreamt that i got it but it was messed up and i didnt like it
*Bronysith glomps Chrysalis
<OtakuTom> lol
<TheRandomkid321> What is this?
<BrOnyxia> but it was awesome
<BrOnyxia> :D
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: l4d2 plz
<OtakuTom> TheRandomkid321: realMyst
<Phase4> 00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, no
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: yes
<Phase4> 00,02i *might* need a clue
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, the crap is the imager?
<Bronysith> SOMEONE GOT A PICTURE OF ME!!! http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/3380/
<TheRandomkid321> I am a few seconds behind... not big deal.
<BrOnyxia> Bronysith :D
<OtakuTom> The imager is right by where you started out on the dock. You almost walked into it a little earlier.
<OtakuTom> It's behind a door you didn't click on.
*Bronysith shreds Chrysalis s cheese legs into nachos
<Chrysalis> wtf
<Bronysith> hoofs
<Bronysith> not legs
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Bronysith: dats not you
<Chrysalis> sith, you are messed up
<Bronysith> hoofs
<Rain> hooves*
<Bronysith> hooves
<Bronysith> ty Rain
<cow334> TIME FOR PONYS
<cow334> lawl
<BrOnyxia> looks like a hard game
<Bronysith> cow334: that is a pic of me
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Bronysith: prove that its you
<Bronysith> [wklmjhe]JRP2234: do you not know what the hell a joke is?
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> muffins
<cow334> Bronysith: really?
<OtakuTom> BrOnyxia: it's nearly 20 years old, and is still one of the best games out there. It just requires a lot of thinking and exploration.
<Phase4> 00,02well
<Phase4> 00,02that did not help
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, its age shows
<BrOnyxia> OtakuTom: yeah seems LO
<BrOnyxia> :P *
<Bronysith> this is a pic of me http://bronysith.deviantart.com/#/d54p1u7
<OtakuTom> There's a panel in there to enter the number of marker switches, Phase4. You have to find it...maybe you missed a button on the wall...(hint hint)
<Phase4> 00,02holy crap thats small
<Phase4> 00,02dats not fair
<OtakuTom> lol
<Bronysith> WTF http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4341/
<BrOnyxia> lololol
*Bronysith eats Phase4 s computer
<OtakuTom> I still think this game is better as point-and-click. There's so many things you can miss in this version by having free movement.
<TheRandomkid321> Today I made a snadvich... I went and bought everything I thought I needed. I went home, made one and ate it. And I thought surely this is not capable of restoring THAT much hp... Then I realised I forgot the new meat... Then I realised that I had made a vegetarian sandvich... then I realised I use ... way too much.
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4808/ me when season 3 is released
<BrOnyxia> i have some ambitions for s3
<cow334> i got disconnected
<cow334> :<
*Bronysith eats cow334
<cow334> And did any one go to bronycon?
<cow334> Bronysith: O-O you cant eat me silly filly
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1978/
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> bronycon appaarnt suck
<BrOnyxia> oh god lol
<Bronysith> um....okay then http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2432/
<BrOnyxia> LOL
<BrOnyxia> Bronysith: xD
<TrixieBaconMuffin> Are you crazy ? Ill never go to bronycon , as cons go , after the huge success this time thees probably gonna be a fire every con now.
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1023/
<Phase4> 00,02i just want to check
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, do those switches EVER do anything
<Bronysith> CELESTIA ONLY HAS 1 EYE
<OtakuTom> The marker switches? Yes.
<Phase4> 00,02ok
<Phase4> 00,02damn
<Phase4> 00,02that throws that theory out the door
<BrOnyxia> lel
*Bronysith throws Phase4 s theory out the door
<OtakuTom> I hate trying to be vague...lol
<Bronysith> IF ONLY! http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1927/
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: do u like dubstep?
<Phase4> 00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, depends
<BrOnyxia> o.0
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> i need a yes or nno
<OtakuTom> Any time I watch someone play this game, I just want to tell them everything about the island...not even the other areas of the game, just the secrets of Myst island, Atrus, Sirrus, and Achenar...lol
<Phase4> 00,02[wklmjhe]JRP2234, i like good dubstep, not bad dubstep
<Phase4> 00,02OtakuTom, dont
<Bronysith> [wklmjhe]JRP2234: every single dubstep song sounds exactlly the same
<OtakuTom> I'm being good, Phase :P
<cow334> Phase4: o-o where are you right now in the game?
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> i attempted dubstep
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, not every single one
<Phase4> 00,02the few good ones are good
<cow334> Like DANM you be in a nother demension
<Phase4> 00,02i think i see
<BrOnyxia> i dun like dubstep that much unless there are ponies involved
<BrOnyxia> xD
<Bronysith> this is Phase4 trying to figure out the game http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/4756/
<OtakuTom> lol
<BrOnyxia> D:
*VioletGreySha hugs Bronysith
*Bronysith glomps VioletGreySha
<BrOnyxia> doesnt look like a 20 year old game
<Phase4> 00,02do those marker switches are for the tower rotation
<Phase4> 00,02Bronysith, ikr
<OtakuTom> They sure are
<VioletGreySha> Bronysith: :3
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: http://soundcloud.com/jrp2234/its-all-lies-jrp2234 i made crap omg
<Bronysith> THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2225/
<OtakuTom> realMyst isn't 20 years old. This is a remake that was made to allow for full movement in the world. The original was a point-and-click...basically a complicated powerpoint or hyperstudio presentation.
<Lil_B> hi everyone

<FairysHuff|KeepsFall> Don't you hate it when you wake up with one of your own hairs in your mouth?
<cow334> FairysHuff|KeepsFall: yup
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> *YAWN*
<cow334> WAIT .... no that dosent happen to me
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> cow334: You must not have long hair
<cow334> FairysHuff|Sleepy: well i do but i dont no how long are you talking about
<cow334> like mine is not that long for that to happen do you get me?
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> cow334: Mine is past my shoulders.

<Spell-of-Gaming> hai everypony :3
<OtakuTom> Phase 4: Welcome to the Spaceship Age
<Lil_B> hi Spell-of-Gaming
<cow334> hai Spell-of-Gaming
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> cow334: Not really. I died my hair something like 8 years ago and now it's falling out ^_^ Not very strong at all. Bald patch on crown.
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> *dyed
<cow334> FairysHuff|Sleepy: sorry about that
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> cow334: Meh, it happens to most men. No point whining about it.
<Dumori> FairysHuff|Sleepy unlikely to have been the dye
<cow334> FairysHuff|Sleepy: i guess then my hair is nice and smooth i liek it
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Dumori: Never know. I had to have it bleached first
<Dumori> yeah
<Dumori> but 8 years is a tad on the long side
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Dumori: Well it's been slowly falling out over that time.
<Dumori> it should be much more imediate if you ruin folicals that badly
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0PdRBxCGbBZ best tut
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Dumori: Well if thats so then I guess it must be genetic.
<Phase4> 00,02well, this is interesting
<Dumori> On the topic of Dyeing hair
<Phase4> 00,02different island
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> I would shave my head and be done with it but you just know some idiots are going to mistake me for some right wing racist just because of that.
<Phase4> 00,02i think this is the stone something age the book refered too
<Dumori> I'm fighting the urge to dye mine two tone electric blue
<Dumori> FairysHuff|Sleepy where do you live?
<cow334> i would want to die my hair but then i dont want to risk any thing
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Dumori: When I dyed mine I dyed it shocking pink with deep blue 2 inch ends. ^_^
<Dumori> the shaved guy due to bolding is quite common here
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Dumori: Scotland.
<Dumori> Ah
<Dumori> I'm S. Yorkshire

<Starlight_Phoenix> Whats happening here this fine day?
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Dumori: You know how society is. I'd have much better luck finding work if I had hair rather than a skin head. O_o Society has strange views on appearance.
*Bronysith glomps FairysHuff|Sleepy
<Dumori> Socity can go fuck it's self tbh
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Bronysith: *Cuddles and nuzzles* ^_^
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Dumori: Yup.
<Dumori> it's a cretin
<Dumori> and a bigot
<StupidSexyCJ> hai everybody, whats going on tonight?
<Starlight_Phoenix> What game is playing on the stream?
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/1559/
<Bronysith> Starlight_Phoenix: myst
<Bronysith> grrr
<Starlight_Phoenix> Which myst?
<Bronysith> i wonder what yahtzee is going to review this week
<[wklmjhe]JRP2234> Phase4: i should live stream u playing while i comemtate
<Phase4> 00,02Starlight_Phoenix, realMyst
<StupidSexyCJ> o hai ghosties
<Ghosties> 04Hai
<Starlight_Phoenix> Hey there ghosties
*Bronysith glomps Ghosties
<Bronysith> hey Ghosties whats up?
<Ghosties> 04Nothing much, think I'm gonna get some sleep though...I'm kinda tired
<cow334> hello Ghosties how are you
<Ghosties> 04Tired
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Just two weeks till my birthday... Wonder what I should do for it...
<Starlight_Phoenix> Well later then ghosties..... sweet dreams
<cow334> Ghosties: cool
<StupidSexyCJ> thats one misty game
*Bronysith gives Ghosties adrenaline
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Ghosties: Sleeps wells
<Ghosties> 04See ya later
<StupidSexyCJ> later Ghosties
<Bronysith> night ghos ahh he gone
<cow334> night ghost
<StupidSexyCJ> in and out
<StupidSexyCJ> now im hungray
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> I suppose I could go to the Edinburgh Museum. Haven't been since it re-opened.
<Phase4> 00,02there is a LOT going on in this game
<Phase4> 00,02gona get some food, brb
<MadSurge> :O what is this?
<OtakuTom> MadSurge: realMyst
<StupidSexyCJ> Phase4: by alot you mean a bunch of junk, or a little bit of junk stretched out over a few hours?
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> MadSurge: Dude, wheres my crack pipe
<MadSurge> FairysHuff|Sleepy: far out, dude
<Tovler> >mfw I heard "Staryu" in "Star U.S. Swimmer."
<OtakuTom> StupidSexyCJ: Once you discover what's going on how to go about the game, it can go by quickly. It's a matter of finding out everything and working out the puzzles.
<StupidSexyCJ> OtakuTom: so a little form column A, a little from column B?
<OtakuTom> Yea, more or less.
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Anyone have any ideas on helping me become more awake? O_o No caffeine though. Makes my heart rattle around inside my ribcage.
<OtakuTom> Once you know the final solution to the game, it can actually be beaten in a matter of minutes, which kinda ruins consecutive playthroughs. I speedrun the game now probably once a year, but since I can beat it so quickly, I've forgotten a lot of the puzzles.
<cow334> FairysHuff|Sleepy: hhmmm well i dont get tired at all i recomend just getting a cooled bucket of water and just throwing your face in it
<StupidSexyCJ> FairysHuff|Sleepy: (1 find a bear (2 poke it (3 ???? (4 Awake forever
<cow334> it will work trust me
<cow334> StupidSexyCJ: lawl
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> cow334: Tried that. Only wakes me for a few minutes.
<cow334> FairysHuff|Sleepy: oh well hmm ill think of ideas and i will tell you when i am done kk?
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> StupidSexyCJ: Tried that. The bear liked it and just lay there.
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> StupidSexyCJ: Now we're a couple
<StupidSexyCJ> FairysHuff|Sleepy: congratulations
*Bronysith sits on FairysHuff|Sleepy
<FairysHuff|Sleepy> Bronysith: *Farts*

<Bronysith> cow334: take away skyrim and you got some good games
<sergio_scriptor> cow334: yes
<cow334> AWESOME
<sergio_scriptor> cow334: for games there is nothing better then an alienware
<Bronysith> sergio_scriptor: except a custom pc
<cow334> Bronysith: skyrim is okay
<d3rb> sergio_scriptor, except a home/self made pc
<Bronysith> cow334: nowhere as awesome as morrowing or oblivion
<cow334> sergio_scriptor: awesome
<Bronysith> cow334: it just has good graphics. THAT IS IT
<sergio_scriptor> Bronysith: indeeeed :) one of this days when i got more money i will order a pc bathed in silver

<cow334> Bronysith: skyrim is awesome well to me
<Lil_B> Wored a little on Art of the dress, Uploaded it to youtube, I think thats enough for now :)
<Phase4> 00,02Irish_Pony, thats the beauty of it'
<Bronysith> http://trollfacecomic.com/post/24353731067/trollface-close-enough
<Phase4> 00,02its like discovering
<cow334> Bronysith: so the computer is good right
<sergio_scriptor> cow334: yes it is
<cow334> Phase4: if i were to buy this would i be able to play all the game i buy for it
<Irish_Pony> http://fav.me/d55v3s5
<Bronysith> cow334: what? alienware is okay for a pre built pc i guess. but skyrim is just like a vast ocean that is 1 inch deep. pretty, but no depth
<cow334> http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/shop/pcs/alienware-x51
<cow334> Brony-FOREVER: hmm well to you i guess
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, its a midrange desktop
<cow334> sergio_scriptor: thanks for helping me out
<Bronysith> cow334: and it is in no way difficult. so it is boring
<sergio_scriptor> cow334: no problem
<cow334> Phase4: But i would be able to upgrade the cpu memory and stuff like that right?
<Phase4> 00,02should run most games, dont expect to run the latest stuff at full though
<Phase4> 00,02most likley overpriced
<Phase4> 00,02cow334, dont worry too much about that
<Bronysith> http://trollfacecomic.com/post/24330088999/science-class
<Phase4> 00,02upgrades are all fine and good, but in practice you'll spend more upgrading then buying a new machine when the old one needs to be replaced
<cow334> Phase4: oh well if i buythe computer i should just not worry about the stuff until it is actually needed then that us when i start to upgrade it
<d3rb> better you buy now cow334 the later you will need to upgrade/replace
<sergio_scriptor> Bronysith: what is your opinion on fallout ?
<Bronysith> sergio_scriptor: ...
<cow334> d3rb: okay

*Sylandest hugs Saturn
<Lasharus|Bed> With all due respect, of course.

<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: it's fine, i'll just throw a bunch of rubber snakes at her
<Lasharus> sergio_scriptor: if you tell your child that he or she was a failure, you do NOT want 'what is best for the child'. If you do that, you are a git.
<Saturn> 08,01she's terrified of them
<Bronysith> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzrzp2XGRj1r72kajo1_1280.jpg
<MadSurge> Saturn: my mom is like that occasionally, I understand :(
<Bronysith> Saturn: have her fall in a pit of rubber snakes
<sergio_scriptor> Saturn: she is only remind you of those mistakes so that you dont make them again :)
<Bronysith> Saturn: then throw real snakes ontop of her
*Bronysith has a troll face
<Sylandest> Saturn: make sure its the big kind. All the big baddies
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: my brother once made her pee herself with fear, literally
<Saturn> 08,01with rubber snakes
<Meanwhile> That sounds terrible.
<Lasharus> ...charming.
<sergio_scriptor> Lasharus: probable she said that so that he did not make the same mistakes again :)
<Bronysith> http://trollfacecomic.com/post/18052458982/true-love
<Irish_Pony> Saturn: that sounds....lovely.....
<Bronysith> Saturn: DO IT FILLY!
<Lasharus> I find that unlikely sergio_scriptor.
<Meanwhile> sergio_scriptor: From 10 years ago?
<Lasharus> Again, reminding someone of a mistake is one thing. Telling them they're a failure as a son is another altogether, and an immense dick-move.
<MadSurge> Saturn: oh wow, lemonade mishap
<Meanwhile> Remember Saturn, this is how you tie shoelaces. Oh and don't eat dirt.
<MadSurge> ^
<Saturn> 08,01MadSurge: in the kitchen as well!
<User0> and, Don't die, dying is bad

<Bronysith> Meanwhile: is this you? http://trollfacecomic.com/post/18037744187/jdyarrington-people-my-thoughts-exactly
<Saturn> 08,01i swear, if i died, she'd be at my funeral, standing over my coffin complaining about how i am so stupid for dying
<User0> Saturn: you and me both
<sergio_scriptor> Saturn: dont say that,im sure she loves you man :)
<MadSurge> Saturn: WOOOOW :D I don't know if laughing is correct

<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: nah, it's cool; we'll make up when i get home
<sergio_scriptor> Saturn: you are so negative man,im sure she loves you :)
<Bronysith> Saturn: okay
<Saturn> 08,01sergio_scriptor: yeah, she does, she just is also forthright and headstrong
<Saturn> 08,01and doesn't acknowledge the fact that i am my own autonomous, thinking entity
<MadSurge> Saturn: I know the type, moms like that are unapproachable when they're angry
<Bronysith> http://trollfacecomic.com/post/18019093517/american-girl-at-heart-i-literally-laughed-out
<Saturn> 08,01indeed
<Lasharus> Saturn, you should really consider telling her that saying 'you're a failure as a son' is... somewhat immensely horrifyingly nasty, and should probably be reconsidered from ever being said again.
<Saturn> 08,01i did the worst thing the other day, though
<Irish_Pony> RAAAH!!
<Saturn> 08,01i got so pissed off with her that i shouted at her "stop being to fucking indian!"
<sergio_scriptor> Saturn: well that is just the way some moms are anoying :)
<Bronysith> http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzplu2JPiw1qlja77o1_1280.jpg
<Saturn> 08,01and was a bad argument after that

<Everlasting_Joy> *us
<Dermathil> Oh cool! Were you the girl?
<derpy_pony> do the "sail" pmv now
<Bronysith> FMA brotherhood was goods
<derpy_pony> what show is this?
<Dermathil> FMAB was awesome
<derpy_pony> japanese don't know shit about reality
<derpy_pony> but still more than the westerners
<twilight_sprinkle> Dermathil: Japanese ftw.
<Dermathil> indeed
<twilight_sprinkle> * derpy_pony
<sergio_scriptor> i suffer from truman sindrome so reality for me is a reality tv show :|
<twilight_sprinkle> Dermathil: wrong ping:P
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Dermathil: if your talking about the short girl in black no, shes my friend i was the dude in the Brony shirt with glasses and a black napsack
<Dermathil> still awesome
<Dermathil> oh cool!
<Dermathil> Glad to meet you there then
<Bronysith> SOUL EATER
<derpy_pony> the music makes everything cool
<twilight_sprinkle> Pain
<Sylandest> I sense epicness
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Dermathil: like wise, sorry if i seemed a bit indifferent was tired from the day
<twilight_sprinkle> Pain is one awesome character
<Dermathil> The naruto sucks
<twilight_sprinkle> Dermathil: why.
<Dermathil> It lasted WAAAAAAAAAAAAY too long
<Bronysith> twilight_sprinkle: flashback flashback flashback
<Dermathil> Too much filler
<Dken2021> longer than bleach combined?
<twilight_sprinkle> Dermathil: so it automatically sucks then?
<twilight_sprinkle> Dermathil: all fo it?
<EggWhite> You could...skip the filler
*Tovler goes back to watching Naruto
<Irish_Pony> Oh god.......
<Bronysith> Dermathil: still more creative than bleach
<sergio_scriptor> Scoot-Scootaloo: can we later watch scrubs ? :)
<Dermathil> Bleach sucks too
<twilight_sprinkle> Dermathil: Naruto may have gotten repeptetive, but not all of it sucks.
<Dken2021> oh look, catcher freeman
<Jim> Gordon Freeman vs Morgan Freeman would be epic
<twilight_sprinkle> Dermathil: and Pain is one of the best characters in any anime.
<Dermathil> heh
<AttackPony> Dken2021: It's "CatchAH Freeman"
<sergio_scriptor> nigga ? :O
<twilight_sprinkle> sergio_scriptor: you must be new to scoots sctreams
<Tovler> Catcher Freeman. Man life was hard for us before Lincolncare
<sergio_scriptor> twilight_sprinkle: im not,but you never lose hope of something diferent :)
<Dermathil> pretty sure the characters of FMAB are all better than Pain<
<Sylandest> what the
<Spade-Magnes[R]> is it just me or is the audio derping?
<Bronysith> ENOUGH OF THE ANIME FLAME WAR
<twilight_sprinkle> Dermathil: i dont know what FMAB is, but very few characters are as deep as Pain, and his view on life is actually realistic and interesting
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03refreshing
<Bronysith> everyone is alowed to have their own opinion on what anime they like
<Tovler> Kumagawa is better than all of them (admittedly Medaka Box is too clever for its own good)
<Saturn> 08,01okay, i need to decide how i'm going to do my hair for this cosplay
<Saturn> 08,01should i go with a wig or dyes?
<Bronysith> Saturn: what cosplay is that?
<derpy_pony> I sense some hidden racism here
<Dermathil> twilight_sprinkle: FMAB is fullmetal alchemist brotherhood. Watch that thing. 64 episodes of awesome.
<Saturn> 08,01Bronysith: pinkie pie cosplaying rianbow dash?
<Sylandest> Saturn: hmm...I would say dyes
<sergio_scriptor> :D
<Bronysith> Saturn: awesomeness
<Dermathil> WIG saturn
<Saturn> 08,01Dermathil: thing is, my hair is naturally curly
<derpy_pony> while we are here...
<derpy_pony> memont
<Bronysith> Dermathil: gurren lagann is 27 episodes of amazinblesness
<Saturn> 08,01so that'd be hilarious
<derpy_pony> moment
<Dermathil> got for dyes then
<Sylandest> Saturn: definitely dyes then :D
<Tovler> poor donald faison.
<Dermathil> Bronysith: TTGL is badass brah
<Bronysith> Dermathil: YES /)
<twilight_sprinkle> i like that black guy
<Dermathil> I always say that. Got a TTMLP poster from bronycon
<Dermathil> /)
<Spade-Magnes[R]> God damn it audio quit derping

<Saturn> 08,01but should i do actual dyes, or spray-in dyes?
<Dermathil> there wasn't any wood like that over there
<Bronysith> Saturn: dyes
<derpy_pony> I assumed it were the last bronycon
<FairysHuff|Eating> I'm bored. What should I do?
<Dermathil> Saturn: put the one that gives the best pink
<Saturn> 08,01the good thing about natural dyes is that it would mean i could have it all ready before the con
<Saturn> 08,01Dermathil: it's already pink
<sergio_scriptor> FairysHuff|Eating: stay at bronystate ? :$
<Dermathil> FLASHIER PINK

<Kammerjunk> twilight_sprinkle: Consider that this was originally a written story.
<MadSurge> AttackPony: I know, the weird thing that attacks those who don't look at it?
<Kammerjunk> Written stories can't have screamers.

<ACS13123> twilight_sprinkle: my representation of the noice the screamers make
<MadSurge> twilight_sprinkle: he means a loud scream

<Vordox> Guys, you all know this song alone caused so many people to hallucinate?
<Master-Derpy> well i was gonna say does any1 else like the music until that..
<Vordox> And made people sick and puke?
<Barbetos|Atwork> They want Ponies guys
<GabeMoist> I think Scoots is reading the Creepy Pasta?
<AttackPony> What's this? I don't see anything creepy from it.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> YOU FOOLS
<Kammerjunk> Quick_Thinker: Oh, but this is Lavender Town!
<Vordox> AttackPony: Use Headphones
<GabeMoist> can't hear him though
<twilight_sprinkle> Vordox: i heard it made children suicide
<Lil_B> Dken2021 its fuuny, everyone says Giygas from Mother 1 and Newtwo look somuch alike because the same teams made the games, and while the thing weith the teams is true, the lead designers were totally different XD
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Vordox: wasnt that the porygon episode
<Vordox> twilight_sprinkle: Several factors, but may be a part of it
<AttackPony> Vordox: I am. Still don't see how it's creepy.
<Vordox> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: No
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Rule of bronystate never ask for ponies, you never get what you want
<Lightning-Quill> Ehh doesn't work on me
<Quick_Thinker> well apparently im lucky it has no effecct on me
<Kammerjunk> I can hear something underneath the music. Am I the only one?
<Very_Silly_Filly> twilight_sprinkle: A bit retarded, ey?
<Vordox> AttackPony: Listen to the tunes, carefully.
<ACS13123> Dken2021: Theres one thing, seeing a Marowak= OMG A POKEMON, seeing a GHOST Marowak is like HOLY CRAP AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
<Midnight_Splendor> Porygon ep only induced seizures.

<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Vordox: well then i didnt here about it then i guess\
<Kandarihu> The other day, someone streamed a nice Metal cover to this song.
<Kammerjunk> Very_Silly_Filly: But it stopped when the video buffered!
<Vordox> The thing is, this is offpanned Tunes
<twilight_sprinkle> Very_Silly_Filly: i guess, but even many adults are oversensitive, let a alone children
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Midnight_Splendor: and because of that Porygon has never been in the anime
<Kipkat07_USAF> Scoot-Scootaloo: can I ever trust you?
<Quick_Thinker> WAIT WAHT IF NOW HEAR ME OUT SCOOTALOO IS GONE AND WE JUST THINK WE HEAR HIM THE SIGNS OF MADNESSS

<Vordox> Offpanned tunes causes headache, depression and nauseating feelings
<acs26> Why cook?
<CrimsonPhoenix> Scoot-Scootaloo, the music is way louder than your voice
<Kammerjunk> Quick_Thinker: conspiracykeanu.jpg?
<acs26> I don't want aids
<ACS13123> CrimsonPhoenix: thats a good thing... :p
<Vordox> This was in the original Pokemon release, as an experiment
<Dken2021> eh, lavender town music isn't that scary, pokemon tower, true terror
<Midnight_Splendor> Funny thing is the seizure inducing scene was actually caused by pikachu not porygon.
<ACS13123> jk
<twilight_sprinkle> we should write a creepypasta about Scoot-Scootaloo after this stream
<GabeMoist> Low frequencies are known to cause uneasiness
<Vordox> But it got changed in the EU release, but not the NTSC release
<ACS13123> I always feared Pokemon tower
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: Joke's on them, I already have a headache.
<ACS13123> I loved Lavender town music
<Biglaw> Dken2021 I remember the first time I encountered the "ghost" there
<acs26> What is we watching?o.o
<AttackPony> Vordox: I hear them but I still don't hear anything wrong. Maybe because I've never played any Pokemon games
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Vordox: wat are you conspiracy Lyra
<Saturn> 08,01well
<Vordox> Kammerjunk: If you guys REALLY want to feel it, Listen to the tunes, where are they coming from?
<Barbetos|Atwork> WELL
<twilight_sprinkle> GabeMoist: like that weapon of Einstein
<Saturn> 08,01i'm going to die in 2048
<Saturn> 08,01when i'm 61
<Kandarihu> Midnight_Splendor, I know. It's so unfair.
<Invi> Vordox out of the speakers
<Vordox> AttackPony: The younger you are, the more sensitive you are to it.
<Jim> how come?
<Barbetos|Atwork> Plan everything
<GabeMoist> Have fun Saturn
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: My headset?
<Ponies47> Oahi Saturn
<Ponies47> *ohai
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: Also, I feel pretty happy right now. This song is relaxing
<Dken2021> Saturn did you get your palm read by a gypsie?
<AttackPony> Vordox: I hear something that sounds like some kind of bass....
<Quick_Thinker> i have no clue where the tunes ae coming from but im not looking to far into it might drive me mad
<Biglaw> Saturn no, you'll live FOREEEVVEEERRR
<Lil_B> Saturn somebody said "I'm gonna kill you in 2058!" ?
<acs26> That fortunteller crap?
<FlareChaser> Must..not..slap..flank...
<Kandarihu> Everyone loves Pikachu, and Porygon is technically artificial.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Vordox: you saying it has to be mono like a gameboy
<Vordox> AttackPony: That's a bass pan, it's...err....How to explain it.
<Vordox> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Gameboy never was mono
<Saturn> 08,01Dken2021: yes, actually. the numbers 61 and 2048 keep on appearing for me when i talk about death.
<Very_Silly_Filly> According to a fortune teller, I'm going to be shot dead in 2034
<FlareChaser> hey Saturn, do you like cookies?
<Invi> Saturn why not 2109 when you are 122?
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: I'm listening to it right now. Trying to locate where I feel the music. I never played much Pokémon, so if that has anything to do with it, nope.avi
<Very_Silly_Filly> Vordox: It only had 1 speaker
<Quick_Thinker> oh thank you buffer
<Kipkat07_USAF> DO NOT WANT
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Vordox: oh i thought it was, since ya know one speaker
<Saturn> 08,01latest one: there's a weird bug in facebook at the moment that's making @[1987:] turn into @[1987:2048]
<Kipkat07_USAF> Buffer is even worse
<Lightning-Quill> I do what I want so i'll die when I feel like it
<Vordox> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: It was stereo. >.>
<Vordox> I think
<Saturn> 08,01which is a freaky coincidence
<Vordox> brb
<Lil_B> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz the very first gamebody had a little text above the Screen "Det Matrix with Stereo Sound" XD
<AttackPony> Vordox: It sounds like a relaxing tune in a way altogether
<Kammerjunk> Quick! What's the name of this video!
<Saturn> 08,01this sort of thing has been happening for years
<Lil_B> Dot*
<FlareChaser> Hmm..
<AttackPony> Saturn: what does it mean?
<Biglaw> Saturn I'll protect you from death!
<Saturn> 08,01maybe it's just because 2048 is a power of 2...
<Kandarihu> It always advertises itself to have stereo sound. I think the stereo sound can only be heard if you have headphones on.
*FlareChaser stares at Saturn.
<Very_Silly_Filly> So I guess in 2034, I'm gonna have to arm myself more than I already am
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Highly likely.
<GilDash> Saturn: Stop paying attention to it and it'll stop happening. :)
<Biglaw> Saturn so are many numbers
<FlareChaser> Stare @_@
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not supersticious!
<Vordox> Sound: 2 square wave generators, 1 PCM 4-bit wave sample (64 4-bit samples played in 1x64 bank or 2x32 bank) channel, 1 noise generator, and one audio input from the cartridge.[33] The unit only has one speaker, but headphones provide stereo sound (for further information, see Game Boy music)
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Lil_B: Vordox im thinking more along the lines of the gb color
<GabeMoist> lost the stream....
<Saturn> 08,01but seriously, it keeps popping up
<Vordox> Weird, I always used headphone so no wonder I never noticed it
<Saturn> 08,01i'm not even looking for it
<AttackPony> Is it buffering for anyone?
<Jim> but you're paying attention to it
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: Try remembering the number 17 instead. That should help.
<Kandarihu> It's buffering for me.
<Vordox> Scoot-Scootaloo Probably dced
<Kipkat07_USAF> Scoot-Scootaloo: I now am terrified of you. thanx
<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: i know how perception and probability works, and i've tried this
<FlareChaser> Chickens.
<Kammerjunk> Does somepony know what the name of this video is?
<Very_Silly_Filly> Might play tetris soon
<GilDash> Saturn: It's like I notice how 42 is everywhere. If I'd never have read that book, I bet I'd never have noticed.
<acs26> If he remember 17
<Dken2021> the ghost took Scoot-Scootaloo!
<FlareChaser> Scoot-Scootaloo is scary guys.
<acs26> Wouldn't he die faster?
<acs26> o.o
<Quick_Thinker> i actually remember hearing this song and being terrified for some reason now i know why DAMN YOU NINTENDO]
<Saturn> 08,01i've even made a note of the frequency of these numbers compared to others when i'm talking about death
<Kammerjunk> I, for some reason, have 17 stuck on my mind. If someone asks me something and I'm even the slightest bit distracted, I just answer '17'.
<NewDCD> 09,01NO SCOOTS NOOOOO
<Midnight_Splendor> Best not to really put much thought into it Saturn thats how those things become self fullfiling.
<Lightning-Quill> so quiet
<Vordox> http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Lavender_Town_Syndrome For people interested in this weird, but unique, pheonomen
<Lil_B> Quick_Thinker My motto: Get out of this goddamn Town! Everytime i played it :/
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> inb4 screamer
<Quick_Thinker> i have 115 appear every where i go
<Saturn> 08,01and they appear about 70% more than any other two
<AttackPony> It's buffering
<GabeMoist> NewDCD has kidnapped Scoot-Scootaloo
<Vordox> About illness sickness and suicidal senstivity
<Kammerjunk> Vordox: But do you know the name of this video?
<Kammerjunk> The one with the music?
<acs26> I like creepypastas
<Kammerjunk> I liked that music.
<Quick_Thinker> so what is it that so bad about that song that drove some people to sucide and madness?

<Very_Silly_Filly> Suddenly, I hear polis
<Vordox> Saturn: High Sonic, Sonic, sub sonic sounds
<CrimsonPhoenix> I like NewDCD
<FlareChaser> Don't...mention..Lavender...Town..
<Saturn> 08,01ACS13123: when 700 children commit suicide?
<Meanwhile> Wait we're talking about creepypasta? That shit is never real, that's the point of it.
<Dken2021> Saturn apparently the japanese version had a high frequency
<FlareChaser> ever...
<cow334> NewDCD: I'll give you a dollar for that thing and 3 for your noms
<Biglaw> Do you think Pi is exactly 3?
<twilight_sprinkle> ACS13123: well death is somewhat newsworthy
<Jim> polis bil what are yo doing?
<Quick_Thinker> i dont mean to be rude but how ARE WE GONNA PAY YOU IF YOU DONT GIVE US THE PAYPAL TO GIVE YOU THE MONEY XD
<ACS13123> Saturn: Ok, that is a bit weird
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: saying a 3 classifications of sound frequency is proof of nothing
<FlareChaser> Lavender Town was like..... my creepy place...
<acs26> WTf is lavender town about?
<FlareChaser> acs26: google.
<Very_Silly_Filly> Frequency can't damage you
<Very_Silly_Filly> You either hear it, or you don;t
<Lightning-Quill> are you high?
<Meanwhile> Oh. Oooooh. The Lavender Town suicides. I remember now. No that's just bullshit creepypasta. Don't read into it.
<GabeMoist> FlareChaser, Celestia will banish you to Lavender Town
<Saturn> 08,01Vordox: it may be plausible, but there's no evidence towards or against its verisimilitude
<FlareChaser> D:
<Vordox> Saturn: Effectually, it led to 4 deaths in children wearing headphones for an extended period of time (Hours). These deaths were caused by brain swelling, a heart attack, and two pain induced suicidesRead more: http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_the_lavender_town_syndrome_real#ixzz1zaM2g5TO

<Kammerjunk> Vordox: >It was all covered up by the Japanese.
<FlareChaser> Chicken.
<Kammerjunk> Looks legit.
<twilight_sprinkle> Very_Silly_Filly: Einstein had a sound weapon that made peopel suicide because of low frequency waves. i forget if thats a myth though ro not, but it definitely influences

<Kammerjunk> WindWhistler: FlareChaser is being a silly filly. It's not like it can drive you to suicide or anything.
<Jim> epic
<Biglaw> Dken2021 shoot someone, and put "YOLO!"
<Zetheross> soooooo... im getting a fluttershy tattoo.... and im conflicted between which face to have
<Kammerjunk> WindWhistler: ...I'm being serious, by the way.
<Marx> Ooh, computer stuff.
<FlareChaser> Kammerjunk: well no, just it gave me a headache.
<Lightning-Quill> you should mod it
<AttackPony> Zetheross: Have you thought about the Fluttershy heart?
<Kammerjunk> FlareChaser: But it's SO relaxing!
<Zetheross> yea
<ACS13123> FlareChaser: What Song?
<Kammerjunk> ACS13123: Lavender Town.
<FlareChaser> Kammerjunk: how the hell is that relaxing!?
<Zetheross> but i just to have her basically standing and having a face she makes
<ACS13123> Kammerjunk: Love that song <3
<ACS13123> :p
<alexxm> i always wondered what was in this kind of stuf
<Kammerjunk> FlareChaser: I don't know! I really just don't know. It's just calming.
<prince-dari> Everyone loves the Lavender Town theme
<prince-dari> It's awesome
<Meanwhile> True facts.
<Kandarihu> You know what's worth than square gates? Plus-sized gates!
<AttackPony> Zetheross: squee face
<Zetheross> was thinking the *over shoulder with one eye* look
<Lightning-Quill> lies
<Lil_B> I'm really thinking about installing tribes Ascent... its a really fun game with retro gameplay
<acs26> I might buy some games from Desura
<Jim> Lil_B: Same
<Kandarihu> Lil_B, it's a good game.
<Biglaw> The oldest game I played? Soccer
<Kandarihu> I've been playing that game lately.
<Scoot-Scootaloo> 00,03The Lavender Town theme froze all my interwebz :(
<ACS13123> FlareChaser: During day = relaing and smoooth During Night = Oh god... whats that.. ahh... AHHHH oh... its just a wild pokemon.... phew... :?
<pony_2136> tribes ascend is great

<Biglaw> Scoot-Scootaloo oh noes :(
<Kammerjunk> Scoot-Scootaloo: Well, what'd you except.

<acs26> Nittany_Discord:Your an alien P:
<Kammerjunk> prince-dari: It does, yeah.
<GabeMoist> Nittany_Discord, I think it's more of a lavender color
<Meanwhile> Alejandro: If you start dreaming of ghost type pokemon I'd suggest an exorcist.
<acs26> xD
<Dken2021> lavender town is happy and calm compared to pokemon tower
<FlareChaser> ....
<Lil_B> Jim: Kandarihu I we could get a Bronystate Server or something I would get it immidietly XD but its a game you have to practice a lot before you get good and at the moment that kind of game is not for me :/
<Zetheross> yea i have 4 tattoos already and i know about choosing whats right
<JRP2234[Web]> hey Nittany_Discord
<Vordox> Hai Nittany_Discord
<FlareChaser> Lavender Town music gave me a headache.
<Kammerjunk> Actually, Lavender Town at night should just have had the normal theme reversed.
<JRP2234[Web]> hey Nittany_Discord u free?
<alexxm> hey Nittany_Discord hows your day been
<Kipkat07_USAF> Scoot-Scootaloo: I hope for your sake I dont dream about squidwards suicide tonight. I will most likely kill myself because of it/
<prince-dari> FlareChaser, dude that's total bullshi
<Zetheross> i always biked through lavender town, but the few times i sat down and listened to it i approved

<prince-dari> Yes
<Zetheross> im gonna use fluttershy cause lamely she's the heart nad soul to why i watch mlp
<alexxm> i always wondered what was in this sort of stuff
<Meanwhile> dari: Watcha talking about?
<Lil_B> Invi I'm on with Xchat, pleased? XD
<prince-dari> FlareChaser saying that Lavender Town theme gave him a headache and a stomach ache
<acs26> Bullshit
<prince-dari> I call placebo effect bullshit
<Invi> Lil_B it was just a recommend ^^
<Meanwhile> Sounds like he needs more fluids.
<Meanwhile> And a sandwich.
*Biglaw doesn't like creepy pasta now ;~;
<ACS13123> prince-dari: I liked it :)
<FlareChaser> I swear it did.
<acs26> I can only read one a day P:
<adasdad> prince-dari: what does that have to do with a placebo effect?
<GabeMoist> prince-dari, The Lavender Town theme caused all my Pokemon to die, is that placebo?
<Biglaw> GabeMoist now, that's poor programing
<prince-dari> Wikipedia says
<acs26> Gabemoist:Just more bullshit
<prince-dari> "Placebo effect, the tendency of any medication or treatment, even an inert or ineffective one, to exhibit results simply because the recipient believes that it will work"
<Biglaw> No*
<Meanwhile> >Wikipedia says
<Meanwhile> >lol
<Kammerjunk> prince-dari: And I concur.
<FlareChaser> ...
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> prince-dari: in other words yur mind makes it real
<prince-dari> He thinks it's going to do something because someone made up some facts
<WindWhistler> prince-dari: So it's kinda like "I think, therefore I am"?
<FlareChaser> >wikipedia in general.
<FlareChaser> lol
<Zetheross> everypony was saying that it gave them a headache and then they come out saying it gave them a headache
<Kandarihu> Last I heard, there won't be distinct punches and kicks in Fighting is Magic. These are quadrapeds after all.

<CryingCanary> My boyfriend just broke up with me.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's called unemployment and an economic depression.

<CryingCanary> No. I cant do that.
<Quick_Thinker> um what is this mother 3 or somthing?
<Zetheross> dem damn exscuses, but it sounds like teenage relationships gone sterotypical
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01If I lived nearby, I'd take you out to do something CryingCanary.
<killerpony7733> Zetheross: Don't be a ass
<Zetheross> i hate em too just keep the head up
<CryingCanary> I cant explain everything of the situation, but it just hurts so fucking bad.
<Kandarihu> Oh, this is a long time ago when SuperBrony64 streamed Mother 3.
<Zetheross> :'C
<Biglaw> CryingCanary you have us, we'll always be here for you
<Meanwhile> CryingCanary: Afraid that's how it works. You've just got to wait for it to dull.
<killerpony7733> CryingCanary: I hope the best for you
*prince-dari hugs CryingCanary
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs CryingCanary. The world sucks, but Bronystate will always be here.
<WindWhistler> Kandarihu: I was told it was SlurryMoon who played it.
<DeadpoolDash> Nothing any of us say can help the hurting. It will always hurt to some degree.
*RX-78-SweetieBot hugs CryingCanary `
<AttackPony> CryingCanary: Forget him, he made a mistake but it's his loss.
<CryingCanary> I cant AttackPony. I care about him so much.
<cow334> What is going on
<Kandarihu> Hover your mouse over the video and look at the top.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Not saying that in vain, either. The world sucks for me as well.
<Zetheross> just keep goin on what makes you win is to keep on chuggin along
<Meanwhile> Nittany_Discord: Amen.
<MadSurge> So sorry to hear that CryingCanary :'(
*GilDash hugs CryingCanary.
<Kandarihu> Wait. I'm seeing the webcam over this now. That's wierd.
<GilDash> CryingCanary: You'll get on top of it eventually. These things take time.
<CryingCanary> Sorry for making this into #depressedstate
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm already depressed.
<AttackPony> CryingCanary: Take it a day at a time, dear. I know that feeling and it's rough but it gets better.
<MadSurge> CryingCanary: can you soldier on?
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Don't worry about it.
<Barbetos|Atwork> Its okay. It helps to share I am sure, so yeah.
<Zetheross> better that it was mutual than an explosion of doom
<CryingCanary> ....
<CryingCanary> It wasnt mutual.
<adasdad> bronystateception
<Biglaw> CryingCanary maybe listening to the smile song will lighten the mood?
<CryingCanary> For once...it actually wont.
<Ginger> So... What exactly are we watching?

<Biglaw> CryingCanary maybe watching ponies? Or listening to some cheerful music?
<DeadpoolDash> Just don't let the rocks push you around
<Zetheross> well when i had to make my ex move out a few months ago giiiirl i could spend days talkin to ya all this stuff
<Kandarihu> Well, I got to go. Time to put some money into my Steam wallet.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I think leaving CryingCanary alone is best.

<Ginger> Chun Li!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't think the original Dead Island did well enough for a sequel.
<Zetheross> ohhhhhhh shit son i wanna PLAY
<Biglaw> IMPOSSIBRU!
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Nittany_Discord: theres gonna be sequel?
<DeadpoolDash> sweet cammy
<Ginger> Well, we'll see how well a sequel actually does. I just wanna see what the story in Riptide will be about
<alexxm> ass
<Jim> FIGHT!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01[15:06:52]	cow334	deadisland 2 has been anounced
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01*shrug*
<Biglaw> Nittany_Discord EL GASPE!
<WindWhistler> As long as we're talking about depressing things...I've got one for you guys.
<Ginger> Dead Island 2 is going under the name Riptide, from what I've heard from E3
<xmasskills> i look at that main menu and think "NOW KISS"
<WindWhistler> Y'all remember my dog that has cancer, right?
<Zetheross> ..
<Biglaw> WindWhistler :'(
<Meanwhile> Eh, Dead Island was apparently pretty meh.
<Biglaw> Meanwhile I'm playing it, it's pretty good
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The amount of sequels is too damn high.
<DeadpoolDash> I forgot how much BS it takes to set up a match
<Zetheross> im playing supermario rpg
<WindWhistler> Well, I was complaining about how my dad and my sister keep giving her treats.
<WindWhistler> See, to me, they're spoiling her. And I don't like that. It's not good for her either.
<DeadpoolDash> Dead Island had a great trailer, but a buggy game
<JRP2234[Web]> lol very random
<WindWhistler> And my sister said: "She'd dying! Have you no heart?"
<Zetheross> does announcer voice do the voice of garen ?
<WindWhistler> Now here's where I get really upset.
<WindWhistler> Of course I have a heart. I don't want my dog to be spoiled!
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Inb4 Superman 64 HD: Because we're that idea broke.
<Biglaw> Nittany_Discord I've noticed a fair amount of "2" and"3" games in my gamine library
<Biglaw> gaming*
<WindWhistler> Because eventually my dog is gonna get really weak.
<DeadpoolDash> drill her
<Ginger> Deadpool, you call a little girl falling backwards into a window great?
<WindWhistler> And because she's given treats on a regular basis
<AttackPony> Nittany_Discord: Don't say that, they could do it
<WindWhistler> she'll keep going to my dad whenever he's about to leave the house
*Biglaw WindWhistler
<Rain> hey, Vacation_Wrek. I finally lost my f2p status on tf2 :D
<DeadpoolDash> The trailer was supposed to be dark, its Zombies
<Lightning-Quill> okay I just had a creepy de ja vu moment
<WindWhistler> Now if she's really weak...she's gonna struggle to get excited...
<Rain> I cans trade and get rarer items :3
<Kandarihu> If Superman 64 were remade as an HD game, it would probably be turned into the game it was meant to be.
<Meanwhile> Ginger: Totally. It was emotional, it had some resonance. It looked like it wasn't a generic boring zombie game. But then it was.
<WindWhistler> and therefore she's gonna suffer...
<WindWhistler> .........and everyone's too busy talking about other things...
<WindWhistler> ugh great.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01The bugs killed it for me.
<Zetheross> im listening wind
<WindWhistler> Well, time to do my usual thing and sulk in the corner.
<AttackPony> WindWhistler: Have you tried explaing to your dad and sister that it's not healthy?
<Biglaw> WindWhistler we're here for you, and I've lost two pets in the past, so I know how you feel
*Nittany_Discord 11,01hugs WindWhistler
<Kandarihu> Have you seen ProtonJon's LP of Superman 64? Awesome stuff.
<DeadpoolDash> do you have the DLC outfits?
<WindWhistler> AttackPony: They're both incredibly stubborn.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> the amount of sad in this chat is to damn high
*RAWRity is currently attempting to beat QWOP
<WindWhistler> My problem is, I don't wanna see my dog suffering in the future just trying to get excited for a treat.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I beat QWOP
<Meanwhile> RAWRity: One does not simply qwop to victory.
<WindWhistler> My sister thinks she's not spoiled.
<CryingCanary> Thanks bronystate. I love you guys. See you later.
<WindWhistler> She doesn't understand why I'm so upset.
<Zetheross> weellllll.... wind do you want to take away one of the things for her to get excited about?
<DeadpoolDash> dont be a stranger
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01WindWhistler: I feel your pain. It hurt me just moving Katrina.
<RAWRity> Meanwhile: well, I'm at 61M atm so I'm doing better than I've ever done before.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Putting her in a cage.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01In a hot car.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I didn't like it.
<Biglaw> See you CryingCanary, hope it gets better
<WindWhistler> Zetheross: If she's gonna suffer in the future because of it, yes.
<AttackPony> WindWhistler: And if your dog dies from all the treats, then what are they gonna say?
<Dovah> WindWhistle take lessons from Iron Will and get your point across.
<CriticKitten> Heh, seems everyone's got issues brewing these days. >.<
<WindWhistler> She'll be too weak, but because she would want a treat so badly, she'd be using up what little energy she has left
<WindWhistler> AttackPony: She has cancer. I'm not saying she's gonna die from treats
<Biglaw> :(
<WindWhistler> I just don't want to see her suffer.
*CriticKitten offers hugs all around.
<Zetheross> take it from perspectives then if you will. id rather have my dog motivated to be excited than mope around waiting to die
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: You'd be hard off finding someone without issues.
<QWOPity> ping me if you need me.
<WindWhistler> Zetheross: If she looks like she's in pain just trying to get excited, I'd be pretty upset.
<Biglaw> QWOPity have fun doing barrel rolls
<Kammerjunk> I got -5 metres in QWOP.
<CrimsonPhoenix> CryingCanary will be fine
<WindWhistler> I know it's gonna happen eventually, she'll either get weak from old age, or from the cancer.
<WindWhistler> or both.
<User0> My friend almost did a flip in QWOP
<Biglaw> Kammerjunk I got to like, 85 meters, then I fell
<Kammerjunk> WindWhistler: I feel you. I lost my old dog to cancer.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01QWOPity: http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-qwop.gif
<Zetheross> yea theres not much to do in that situation, but if it was me id like my dog to still become excited at least once a day just so that they dont just... lie there
<User0> Nittany_Discord: well played
<AttackPony> WindWhistler: But still, the fact that she's hurting herself getting excited....
<Jim> Nittany_Discord: Is that a real game?
<Kandarihu> Procaster, huh? I should look into that as well.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I beat QWOP, but I dragged my legs the whole way.
<Kammerjunk> She was old. I'm glad she was put down, really. Better than letting her suffer for it.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Jim: Not yet.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I'm sure someone will make that.
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01It's not hard.
<WindWhistler> The weird thing is, you wouldn't be able to tell my dog has cancer.
<WindWhistler> She acts just like she normally does.
<WindWhistler> But I know that sooner or later, it'll catch up with her.
<Zetheross> off topic i would sooooo love it if they streamed fighting is magic on here
<AttackPony> WindWhistler: What kind of cancer is it?
<Zetheross> when its out
<WindWhistler> AttackPony: I don't know...but I know it can't be cured.
<CrimsonPhoenix> lollivestream
<QWOPity> 70M
<CriticKitten> Meanwhile: 'tis true, but doesn't mean it doesn't suck all the same
<CrimsonPhoenix> also you can get rid of that yellow circle people
<AttackPony> WindWhistler: Ohhh *giant hugs*
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> wat is QWOP?
<CrimsonPhoenix> why does noone check the settings
<Meanwhile> CriticKitten: Oh I know.
<WindWhistler> Fortunately, she isn't getting worse...
<User0> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: try google
<Kandarihu> I'd like to see you try that stick out on Touhou Hisou Tensoku, but I gotta go now.
<WindWhistler> but because she's so old, her body's gonna give out eventually.
<GabeMoist> FPS is all over the place
<Zetheross> :(
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> User0: but im lazy
<WindWhistler> You know, it doesn't really help when I'm also fretting over my grandparents' dog.
<WindWhistler> Now SHE has issues.
<AttackPony> WindWhistler: I don't mean to sound horrible, but what would you do if it comes to a decision to put her down or let her keep getting treats if it keeps her happy?
<WindWhistler> She's the fattest beagle I've ever seen.
<CriticKitten> And WindWhistler: Our family lost our previous dog the same way. She developed a cancerous growth between her stomach and intestines that was making it harder for her to properly digest food and absorb nutrients. So she just sort of....wasted away in front of us.
<CriticKitten> It SUCKS.
<Kammerjunk> CriticKitten: That's when you know it's time to put her down. Saves her pain.
<CriticKitten> So I know that feeling too well.
<cow343> who is winning
<WindWhistler> I'm scared for when that moment comes...
<QWOPity> 80M!
<WindWhistler> I don't think I'll be able to take it.
<WindWhistler> I practically grew up with my dog.
<Zetheross> i learned early with some family deaths that i dont want to talk about that things... people .. die
<Obsidian> Hey there everypony. What we watching?
<Zetheross> some streetfighter done right
<Eagle3302> bad timing
<Zetheross> on joystick
<AttackPony> WindWhistler: I'm sure that your heart will make the right choice. We had to put our dog down last February.
<CriticKitten> Kammerjunk: She was still pretty happy and tried to be perky and such. I think she knew and was just trying to put on a bold face for us. We decided she needed to be put down before she got to the point where she couldn't walk, because it wasn't right to let her suffer that way.
<Kammerjunk> All this emotional stuff is too much for me. I'm going to go eat icecream or something.
<Dovah> I've had 25 dogs come and go sorry to say but you kind of build up a tolerance to it.
<WindWhistler> AttackPony: I hope so...but I just get too attached to my pets...and I'm already a pretty sensitive person as it is.
<Eagle3302> Well my dog got bitten to death by other dogs and was bleeding out before it died :(
<Zetheross> i mean i dont think anyone would care that my pet snake died prematurely of an ailment, but i still cried hard
<WindWhistler> I've lost so many pets...and a few people too...
<Biglaw> Dovah kiin!
<CriticKitten> WindWhistler: Yeah, my parents knew how much she meant to me, too. They let me keep her ashes.
<CriticKitten> Maybe ask your parents if they won't do the same for you.
<alexxm> just had dinner i miss much
<Dovah> Biglaw : ???
<CriticKitten> It helps, it honestly does.
<WindWhistler> Oh man, I'm getting teary eyed just talking about this...
<CrimsonPhoenix> Death is the finish line to the race of life. Be happy that he achieve his trophy with all the good moment he had to go through troughout the race.
<Eagle3302> The worst part is when you actually see them die...
<AttackPony> WindWhistler: You needs a much bigger hug *gives bigger hug*
<Biglaw> WindWhistler I lost a few pets, and a friend tried to take her life, it's hard what you're going through and we're here for you all the way
<Meanwhile> This conversation makes me glad I have the same emotional resonance as a steel cube.
<Zetheross> if my snake i have now died prematurely like that id be crying hard, but because of peoples view towards them no one would care in fact some would cheer
<WindWhistler> I keep thinking about the moment when I come home, and she's no longer there to greet me...
<Biglaw> Dovah I said that, because it would sound like Dovahkiin, Dragonborn!
<Kandarihu> Clipping through the wing.
<alexxm> Kandarihu you saw that as well
<WindWhistler> It doesn't help that I also have a gecko who's six years old...he's reaching his time too...
<Dovah> Biglaw: exactly
<Biglaw> Funfact: Dhalsin wears those skulls around his neck, because they were the skulls of children who died from illness in his village, and he wears them as a reminder
<AttackPony> WindWhistler: Just cry it out, honey. Cry until you can't anymore.
<Zetheross> aww i had a leopard gecko
<WindWhistler> If I lose two pets around the same time, I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle it.
<Eagle3302> No offence but I think Dogs and Cats for deeper bonds with humans than reptiles...
<Eagle3302> *form
<WindWhistler> I think I might crack.
<Kandarihu> Yup. It would've made for a funny easter egg for Cammy's special to just break the wing off.
<Zetheross> see
<Dovah> Not to sound heartless but everything dies it's a fact of life you just have to learn to live with it.
<WindWhistler> Eagle3302: When you're someone like me, it doesn't matter.
<WindWhistler> A pet is a pet.
<CriticKitten> WindWhistler: It's tough. Just know that she got to enjoy a pretty great life with you. Most pets can't ask for a better life than with their family members.
<QWOPity> 90M!
*Biglaw holds WindWhistler close
<Vordox> So much sexism in that series...
<Biglaw> QWOPity daaaang
<Biglaw> Dats far
<Zetheross> so sometimes man it just falls upon yourself to cherish the memories and heal yourself. like i said no one cared that my snake died even some cheered
<Eagle3302> I am saying on thee animals side, humans get attached to any creature...
<Biglaw> :(
<WindWhistler> I think what really kicks me in the gut is the fact that animals don't have souls. Meaning I won't see them in heaven...
<User0> "Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened." Dr. Seuss
<Vordox> WindWhistler: Animals have as much soul as anything else
<Eagle3302> i AM NOT GETTING INTO A RELIGIOUS CONVERSATION, BYE...
<Zetheross> now thats not true wind idc what religion you are
<WindWhistler> Zetheross: Christian.
<CriticKitten> Dunno about you, but I've had pets who I think were better people than some people I've known.
<sagas> Okay im watching Code Geass and can someone help me with something?
<Vordox> NewDCD: not going good for you. :P
<Zetheross> i still dont care they have as much significance as we do
<Eagle3302> Pardon caps...
<killerpony7733> Ok for the sake of the peace of the chat, don't talk about religion ok?
<sagas> ???
<Kandarihu> WindWhistler, I know the pain you feel. I had just the SWEETEST kitty around. I still remember when she was diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism and a kidney disorder.
<Vordox> NewDCD: Same thing as before, too high loud game, too low Mic. :P
<Eagle3302> Yes thank you
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Oh hello Sagat
<killerpony7733> hi sagas :)
<WindWhistler> Kandarihu: that sounds awful...
<sagas> hello killerpony7733 :)
<WindWhistler> Okay, I don't think I can handle much more sadness. Sorry for this. I just had to talk to someone about this...,
<Eagle3302> Am I the only one who noticed that nowadays animals and humans become ill more often and they seem to wear out faster?
<Kandarihu> She lived for a bit over 4 years. She was not a very good patient.
<Vordox> You need to improve your pokes, NewDCD
<Dovah> Tip: dont have a bunny if you have dogs, a bunny of mine died of pure terror when one of my dogs barked. :|
<Zetheross> its ok wind
<CriticKitten> WindWhistler: No worries. :)
<Obsidian> WindWhistler: You can tel us anything. We are here for you
<Vordox> Damnit, why can't I hear NewDCD ><
<Zetheross> if you need you can just chat me if it continues
<WindWhistler> Eagle3302: That is true.
<killerpony7733> Eagle3302: Possibly
<alexxm> hey killerpony7733 hows your day been
<Vordox> Can any of you else hear NewDCD ?
<Eagle3302> It may be all the pollution and chemicals we consume and contact...
<sagas> Can someone answer a question I have regarding Code Geass please?
<killerpony7733> alexxm you silly filly i have been here for hours :D
<Obsidian> Vordox: Not me
<WindWhistler> I noticed in the Bible, the first humans lived for almost 1000 years, and then slowly they began living less longer..until about 100 years.
<Eagle3302> Or next stage in evolution...
<alexxm> i derped killerpony7733
<WindWhistler> Of course you can make of that what you will
<sagas> -_-
<Kandarihu> The thing is, a month after she passed away, her daughter was diagnosed with pretty much the same thing. And she lived for only a year afterwards.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Oh got
<sagas> really? We're talking religion here of all places?
<Dovah> We do not want religious talk!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Hello lard ass
<Biglaw> WindWhistler Well, medicine has advanced greatly in the past century
<killerpony7733> alexxm: Still you haven't asked me at anytime but it's been a good day done this and that
<WindWhistler> Hey, I'm just saying what I observed. I'm not trying to start a religious talk...
<Vordox> Dat Rufus
<Dovah> Just don't metion religion. At all.
<Eagle3302> Humans mix up too much we transfer defective genes, in the past the strongest survived. Now the ones with money's get all the benefits...
<WindWhistler> Geez...
<killerpony7733> WindWhistler: Yeah it's best not to start one due to the high chance of conflicting views
<Om> uuuhg
<Kandarihu> Guys, if we can all just keep our cool, religious discussions should be fine.
<Vordox> WindWhistler: Animals have kids, they care about their kids = Proof enough for me they have souls. And honestly, animals rarely ever lie, compared to us.
<killerpony7733> Om you sound like a zombie :D
<Vordox> That's all the proof I need
<alexxm> so what sort of stuff can the fat guy do
<Vordox> alexxm: Alot of stuff...he's one of the fastest
<Eagle3302> You are either strong or smart, if you are both then you have won natural selection...
<Om> killerpony7733: I don't wana get up, e_e but I'm hungry. So yes I am a zombie
*QWOPity has QWOPed to victory: http://i.imgur.com/JEG3o.jpg
<Lightning-Quill> is this street fighter?
<Zetheross> hes good at in-air combos
<WindWhistler> killerpony7733: Like I said, I wasn't trying to start one. I was just pointing out what I noticed. In case there is any historical accuracy in it.
<alexxm> Vordox i'm not that surpriseed
<GabeMoist> WindWhistler, in the Bible, the people who lived hundreds of years lived before the Flood, afterwards, the ages rapidly decreased to about 100ish years
<Obsidian> COngrats QWOPity
<killerpony7733> Om Well have fun with that :P
<CriticKitten> Dangit, first I'm watching the sad part of Sengoku Basara, and then chat sads. All the sads today XD
<User0> QWOPity: legit or kneesliding?
<Vordox> GabeMoist: Weird, before the flood?
<QWOPity> User0: the fuck you think?
*Om eats killerpony7733 brain, but is unsatisfied
<killerpony7733> Om ......what
<Biglaw> good job QWOPity!
<Vordox> Dat Rakan's grip is OP :P
<alexxm> why did he just cover himself in oil
<Eagle3302> I doubt original humans lived over 60years, they would die of hunger, infection or get killed, their lifespan is nearly impossible to estimate.
<Vordox> alexxm: Sliding
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> qwop sounds like clop
<killerpony7733> Also everyone discussing avoid the god damn religious talk please
<Eagle3302> qwop is the best game
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> qwopqwopqwopqwopqwopqwopqwopqwopqwop
<Eagle3302> aparently there is a pinkie pie version... is that true?
<WindWhistler> killerpony7733: All they're mentioning is the lifespans of humans...
<Om> killerpony7733: Eyyyup
<alexxm> Vordox ok
<GabeMoist> killerpony7733, there aren't any arguements happening, we're just talking
<Kandarihu> Please stop telling other people what to discuss or not to discuss.
<Biglaw> How to win at QWOP, QO WP QO WP repeat
<Dovah> People don't live for 1000 years there is absolutly no solid proof.
<Eagle3302> As said before, we can discuss enything just keep cool.
<Vordox> Any arguement can be made in here, as long as it keeps within the rules, and gives everyone freedom of their speeches.
<Biglaw> Dovah cryogenics?
<Dovah> never have lived that long but there is a chance that they will.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> To win at QWOP, slide
<RX-78-SweetieBot> We can dance if we want to.
<Lightning-Quill> her custume and graphics disturb me
<Eagle3302> -2 meaters record
<Lil_B> To win at QWOP, Mioonwalk
<Zetheross> dat ass
<Eagle3302> cya dinner time
<Lil_B> Moonwalk*
<Lil_B> bye Eagle3302
<Biglaw> Three Hour Dungeon
<Vordox> Dovah: Cryogenics are kinda....errr....impossible atm.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Biglaw: 1 year dungeon
<Vordox> as for people thinking freezing works, there's huge issues with that, due to the ice crystals tearing up inside people
<Dovah> never mentiond cryogenics.
<Biglaw> One MILLION YEAR DUNGEON!
<WindWhistler> Isn't the life expectancy of humans starting to increase in certain countries?
<BronyBro> what am i watching?
<killerpony7733> Vordox: Yep exactly
<Vordox> Dovah: In response to the person who said it to you
<Biglaw> That would be me :p
<BronyBro> Derpy kicks ass
<WindWhistler> Only frogs can live through being frozen.
<Zetheross> its gonna be attempted with genetic engineering not cryostasis
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> im not saying aliens
<MadSurge> Lil_B: Did you ever see the Freelance Astronauts winning at QWOP? :D
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> but aliens
<RaveBrony> Hey, everypony! :)
<WindWhistler> Or at least one species of frogs.
<Zetheross> herro
<BronyBro> how do i make faces?
<MadSurge> Ohai RaveBrony!
<BronyBro> KO
<Nittany_Discord> Life expectancy has been increasing for as long as I've been living.
<Vordox> If we're talking about ages, guys. I'll say Cell splitting
<Biglaw> Time to QWOP!
<Obsidian> BronyBro: Icon next to the chat bar
<Zetheross> actually quite a few animals can survive being frozen
<AttackPony> Well guys, I'm gonna head too to school. Be back in about 0 minutes
<WindWhistler> cell splitting?
<Vordox> Nittany_Discord: You lost your colour when you blew up
<BigQWOP> Tally-Ho!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Biglaw: Lets hope it QWOPerates
<Dovah> QQ since I am newish here: is it really necessary to type someones full name if you want to reply to them?
<Obsidian> Bye AttackPony
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01Got it back.
<MadSurge> Zetheross: like frogs and snakes
<BronyBro> I thought i was gonna watch my little pony
<MegaMoonShine> Dovah: No
<Meanwhile> Dovah: Type part of it and press tab
<User0> Dovah: type the first 2 or 3 letters and then press tab for autocomplete
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> alons'y
<Vordox> Dovah: You write in 3-4 letters of their name, then press tab
<WindWhistler> I thought there was only one type of frog that could survive through freezing...
<Dovah> oh ty
<Zetheross> dat face
<Kandarihu> Ah, Cammy's theme music her.
<Kandarihu> here
<WindWhistler> What was it called again?
<WindWhistler> Wood frog?
<Zetheross> nope quite a few animals are capable of freezing and 'coming back"
<WindWhistler> I dun remember
<Meanwhile> I think Lungfish can survive being frozen.
<User0> not enough guile's theme...
<MadSurge> Dat face O__O
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> I'm a new brony musician, I do I get my music out there?
<Meanwhile> And so can one species of cricket.
<Vordox> Zetheross: If you're talking about the frogs/Insects, they are kinda a different specie then ours
<WindWhistler> Cockroaches can survive anything.
<alexxm> so what did juri do?
*GabeMoist can survive being frozen
<User0> WindWhistler: except for a hammer, I tested that the other day... (except not)
<MadSurge> WindWhistler: they can't survive boots :D
<MegaMoonShine> ^
<Zetheross> im saying more than just a frog species can
<Vordox> TheSeaponiesofLiverp: You're a musician? Try to get in contact with EQD if it's Brony musics, otherwise, use friends or contacts.
<WindWhistler> They can survive seven days without their heads.
<BronyBro> Fluttershy kicks ultimate ass shes at least 20% cooler than the rest of them!
<Ponies47> Ah. Nothing like a nice walk with your dog. I'm back :)
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> its a seapony version of a couple of beatles songs
<Meanwhile> A chicken once survived years without a head.
<WindWhistler> Oh yeah, if you don't cut certain blood vessels, chickens can live without its head
<WindWhistler> their*
<BigQWOP> 46 meters :p
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> I just finished "I get by with a little KELP from my friends"
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: ninja'd. :(
<Vordox> TheSeaponiesofLiverp: Wellll. You could link it here when no stream is going on
<BronyBro> i like trains
<Zetheross> im saying that cryostasis wont be the way we live for hundreds of years its being attempted with genetic engineering, but idk about the sounds of that
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ok chats getting wierd now
<MegaMoonShine> TheSeaponiesofLiverp: Cool :D
<Vordox> TheSeaponiesofLiverp: During stream time we may only link pictures relate dot he stream, otherwise you need to wait for people to stop streaming to send up the youtube/Vimeo here
<killerpony7733> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Eeyup
<MadSurge> WindWhistler: proof that chickens have no need for a brain :D
<Vordox> TheSeaponiesofLiverp: Then you can ask for our critique, if you wish for feedback
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> I don't know how to get someone else a mp3 so its just on the band tumblr right know
<User0> MadSurge: doesn't their brain extend into their upper necks?
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> *now
<WindWhistler> MadSurge: Or rather, proof that SCOOTALOO has no need for a brain.
<Meanwhile> Fun fact, if you hold a chickens head to the floor and draw a line in front of it it will just lie there and stare at it.
*WindWhistler cracks herself up
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> and its vocaloid
<Vordox> TheSeaponiesofLiverp: Well you could link anything here, band camp even if you are able to play it online.
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> a bit
<MadSurge> WindWhistler: ;__; NO POOR SCOOTALOO
<alexxm> Meanwhile how did you find that out
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The fuck is this thing?
<WindWhistler> alexxm: probably tried it himself
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> what is bandcamp?
<MadSurge> Oh here comes bullshit boss :D
<Vordox> Dat op Seth
<Zetheross> that seth slide
<WindWhistler> I don't wanna see men fighting, I wanna see GIRLS fighting! Play some Touhou!
<Meanwhile> alexxm: I read it somewhere then tried it with one of my chickens.
<User0> Needs more Wombo Combo...
<Spade-Magnes[R]> What the hell is Seth?
<GabeMoist> that ain't falco
<WindWhistler> needs more Touhou
<alexxm> Meanwhile i take it that it worked then
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> I pretty much made the lyrics then used text-to-voice and put it to music
<Meanwhile> alexxm: Mhmm.
<MadSurge> WindWhistler: I dunno who can play Touhou in the mods :D
<Vordox> Spade-Magnes[R]: Expermimental Ying Yang specie
<GabeMoist> WindWhistler, DCD should play Hisoutensoku
<BronyBro> im 20% cooler than ever!!!
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> Cami should've farted right then
<WindWhistler> SlurryMoon can play the shooter Touhou games.
<MadSurge> DED
<GabeMoist> WindWhistler, does he?
<Vordox> You sure you can take him, Newdd?
<BronyBro> wtf am i watching?
<Vordox> NewDCD: ?
<WindWhistler> Well, I'm pretty sure he does.
<NewDCD> 09,01dunno, Seth always gives me trouble
<GabeMoist> WindWhistler, which has he played?
<NewDCD> 09,01and now add lag to that
<Kandarihu> GabeMoist, I was thinking that too.
<Vordox> Hehe
<BronyBro> dont die bro!!
<Zetheross> use air kick pressure
<Vordox> Seth is a bastard OP char. :P
<BronyBro> rso intense!!!

<BronyBro> awwwww
<Zetheross> over over overKILL
<MegaMoonShine> Man, that is one tough dude
<BronyBro> nice try
<Vordox> If NewDCD does 5 mistakes, it's over.
<Vordox> MegaMoonShine: No, he's cheap
<alexxm> seth is broken
<BronyBro> :D
<SlurryMoon> 3Which video?
<WindWhistler> SlurryMoon: The one with Mother 3
<GabeMoist> I tried playing the Touhou fighting games, not good at them
<Vordox> SlurryMoon: Hai! Heard you played Touhou? =3
<SlurryMoon> 3Oh, yeah, that's me
<User0> Vordox: not even "mistakes"
<BronyBro> :3
<Saturn> 08,01wow fans: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0079PC0EI/laughing-squid-20

<BronyBro> ko
<Meanwhile> Saturn: Dude.
<WindWhistler> Yeah, on that same video you tried playing EoSD, and failed superbly
<User0> Vordox: there is a tad bit of luck in there too
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So is Seth just a combination of several character's moves?
<Kandarihu> Wow. That's one heck of a finishing move.
<Vordox> SlurryMoon: I expect to see you play Touhou later then :P
<BronyBro> nice ass
*User0 nuzzles Saturn.
<MegaMoonShine> Saturn: http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/113/216/shutup_rainbow.jpg
<Vordox> User0: No, there's no luck
<GabeMoist> I've made it to Remilia in EoSD
<Meanwhile> That outfit looks terribly impractical.
<BronyBro> be mr t!
<Vordox> There is no luck in the world.
<Vordox> It's all math and logics.
<WindWhistler> I made it to Yuyuko in PCB, but died in her second phase.
<BigQWOP> NOIOO!OOO!O!O!O!O
<BronyBro> :O
<WindWhistler> I was playing a Christmas mod of the game, so she was a fruit basket.
<WindWhistler> It was hilarious.
<Ponies47> Saturn: I've already got to many versions of Monopoly already :P
<BronyBro> :P
<WindWhistler> Sakuya was Rudolph.
<Vordox> Wake up cancels, avoid those if you can, DCD!
<BigQWOP> I reached 100.7 meters!!!! Bet I didn't get the win screeeeen!!!!! FDFAF
<BronyBro> colurful :D
<GabeMoist> EoSD and MoF, I made it to the last boss (not extra). That's the farthest I've gotten on Touhou games
<Bronysith> http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/2726/ yup
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Is there no stream right now?
<BronyBro> ur screwed
<WindWhistler> UFO is my best game.
<Vordox> GabeMoist: On Insanity?
<Zetheross> DAT AIR KICK PRESSURE I TELLS YOU
<MegaMoonShine> Pinkies4thWall|Sick: There is
<BronyBro> wow wtf
<GabeMoist> Vordox, LOLNO
<BronyBro> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
<WindWhistler> I beat Extra Mode three times with Sanae B, and once with Marisa A
<BronyBro> :D
<MegaMoonShine> Pinkies4thWall|Sick: Try refreshing?
<alexxm> Pinkies4thWall|Sick there is a stream and i hope you feel better
<WindWhistler> Vordox: You mean Lunatic.
<BronyBro> fuck that shit
<Zetheross> awwww
<MegaMoonShine> Awww dude!
<BronyBro> you got this
<Vordox> Ah yeah WindWhistler , lunatic, my favourite setting. <3
<WindWhistler> I was so proud of myself for being able to beat UFO Extra so many times...
<WindWhistler> And then I got a new computer.
<BronyBro> op much
<WindWhistler> And now for some reason, all the games play much faster than I remember.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Please tell me Seth isnt unlockable
<BronyBro> >:D
<GabeMoist> Vordox, I use lunatic to practice, then play on Normal
<WindWhistler> Especially SA
<BronyBro> omg
<Vordox> This is one of the reason why I dislike SF4, it's too restricted to be enjoyed for me.
<Zetheross> WUT
<MegaMoonShine> :O
<BronyBro> i think you got him
<GabeMoist> I don't practice consistantly enough to win
<Zetheross> not over til its over
<BronyBro> NOOOO
<alexxm> seth is broken as all hell
<Vordox> I prefer measures and countermeasures play, that's where the mind games are the most fun. <3 like in Blazblue
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Why is this guy so bullshit?
<Zetheross> dat azz
<BronyBro> Try someonr else?
<WindWhistler> well I gotta get back to watching Avatar: The Last Airbender.
<Vordox> BronyBro: It's his main
<WindWhistler> I'm on season 3. Gonna see if I can finish it tonight.
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Okay. there. Firefox is being a fucking bitch right now, AND SO IS FUCKING GOOGLE CHROME
<Kandarihu> He seems to have moves from other characters, kind of like Necrid in Soul Salibur 2
<BronyBro> oooh did not know thats how it worked
<Kandarihu> Soul Calibur 2
<Saturn> 08,01alexxm: why?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So what is seth? A fusion of a bunch of characters?
<BronyBro> noooo
<Dovah> WindWhistler: A:TLA was epic :p
<BronyBro> hes a bitch
<BronyBro> Seth is SO op
<Vordox> Spade-Magnes[R]: He's a experimental Yin Yang specie, created to absorb energies
<Kandarihu> Pinkies4thWall|Sick, maybe the fault lies with something that's running in both programs, like Flash.
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Firefox has no picture, and Google only types like this: 012345678901234567890
<BronyBro> nice
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> dead chat?
<alexxm> Saturn from what i've seen he's moves seem cheap
<Zetheross> rawr
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> no derped
<Vordox> So many meaty attacks. D: never good against a cheap AI
<Kammerjunk> Pinkies4thWall|Sick: Still better than IE.
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> DON"T START ME on that
<BronyBro> i dont think you got this one :(
<MegaMoonShine> Nope
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> dou you guys mind if its vocaloid like singing
<Kammerjunk> Firefox and Chrome are both, with all their flaws, several googolplex times than IE.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So...cheap
<BronyBro> IE sucks glue
<TheSeaponiesofLiverp> I have a bad lisp and not comfortable singing
*GilDash jumps on Om.
<Kammerjunk> I'd bring it up to Graham's number, but that's just overkill.
<Vordox> TheSeaponiesofLiverp: You can use any tool for making music, it's how you use the music tool that makes people like or hate it
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Graham?
<Kandarihu> It's like you're fighting against everybody in a single fighter.
<GabeMoist> Alright, I'm gonna play some Touhou now, which shall I play?
<BronyBro> do what i do when im stuck on a level SMASH ALL THE BUTTONS!!!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Oh come on
<BronyBro> :(
<Om> ahrgg!
<Kammerjunk> Spade-Magnes[R]: Basically, if you fill the entire universe at it's expected size with neutrons all containing 1 digit, Graham's number contains more digits.
<Vordox> GabeMoist: 6 :P
<Ponies47> brb
<BronyBro> You Got this :)
<Vordox> GabeMoist: Or 1-5
<Spade-Magnes[R]> That is one cheap grab
<Meanwhile> Yup.
<GabeMoist> 1-6, that's really vague
<killerpony7733> Om Blerg!
<BronyBro> that move always sets you back :(
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> IE. tried it earlier. got like 50 "this program is trying to access your computer" messages in one minute
<Vordox> GabeMoist: Play EOSD
<Dovah> Kammerjunk: ever heard of googol? or googolplex?
<BronyBro> ur dead :(
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Denied
<Kammerjunk> Dovah: I have. Graham's number dwarfs both.
<Om> killerpony7733: I was jumped by a wild GilDash e_e
<Zetheross> ...
<GabeMoist> Alright, EoSD it is!
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Dovah: biiiiig numbers
<Vordox> GabeMoist: Good luc
<GilDash> Om: Yes you were. ;)
<Dovah> Kammerjunk: but.. but but... thats not POSSIBLE!!
<BronyBro> FUS RO DAH!!!!!!
<alexxm> well this guy seems like a cheating AI
<GabeMoist> Maybe I'll beat Remilia this time
<Zetheross> i be back later guys it was a great first time on bronystate :D
<BronyBro> seth has mods.
<Vordox> Zetheross: Hope to see you again
<Meanwhile> Bye Zetheross
<Zetheross> oh... i will be back.. haha
<Vordox> alexxm: No he's cheap
<alexxm> bye Zetheross
<Kammerjunk> Dovah: Oh, yes it is. A googolplex is only larger than if you fill the entire KNOWN universe with said digit-containing neutrons.
<BronyBro> not this time....
<Vordox> I see alot of mistakes that NewDCD does. :P
<Spade-Magnes[R]> That teleporting is cheap
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> SONIC BOOM SONIC BOOM
<Vordox> Which he can turn
<alexxm> Vordox whats the differance?
<Dovah> Kammerjunk: how bout a googleplexianith??!?!
<BronyBro> WTF!!
<Om> GilDash: Well, if you are done. I'll go back to the un-tackled Om now.
<Vordox> alexxm: Cheap gives you no chance to counter stuff, cheatin is where it's reading your buttons
<Kammerjunk> Also, A(g64, g64). QED.
<BronyBro> SONIC BOOM!!!!
<Vordox> alexxm: And right now, it's both =P
<killerpony7733> Om Best not to hope :D
<alexxm> thanks Vordox
<Ponies47> BACK :p
<Vordox> So cheap cheating AI XD
<GilDash> Om: No tussling?
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> SONIC BOOM SONIC BOOM
<Vordox> I wonder NewDCD can't counter throws?

<Vordox> Oh, it's tha thard to do? bleh
<NewDCD> 09,01it's my second day with a stick, so yeah
<ACS13123> any one wonder what the Brony Musicians used to do before ponies?
<killerpony7733> Om not when it's GilDash :P
<Vordox> NewDCD: It's going to take a month or so until you get back to good. ><
<Kandarihu> ACS13123, maybe Touhou remixes.
<Om> GilDash: Cant. Against teh rules, and I shouldn't rp in mane chat anyways.
<User0> ACS13123: I used to play in a school orchestra, and then I put down my violin for a while... (I only picked it back up to play pony...)
<Om> killerpony7733: Yup.

<NewDCD> 09,01also still trying to choose a comfortable grip
<Vordox> Returning to mission, just having this leotard. XD
<Vordox> NewDCD: How's the wrist handling goinG?
<ACS13123> Thing is though, we never even probably HEARD of them before ponies :/
<Kandarihu> We lost sound.
<NewDCD> 09,01my hands are rather big so some common grips are uncommon
<NewDCD> 09,01I mean
<NewDCD> 09,01unusable by me
<User0> NewDCD: try wearing gloves?
<Meanwhile> You know what they say about guys with big hands?
<Vordox> Meanwhile: Big fate
<Meanwhile> Hard to buy gloves for.
<BronyBro> :O :) :( :D
<BigQWOP> http://fav.me/d55ytsh :D
<Vordox> If you have too big hands, you need a upwards wrist grip, or if it's too big, even a downward wrist grab.
<Dovah> I think my brain just 'sploded....
<User0> I have rather large hands and I found biking gloves that fit very well.
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA
<Saturn> 08,01"i promise your applejack will not go up my butt"

<BronyBro> Nice rack
<BronyBro> lol
<NewDCD> 09,01still testing different grips
<Spade-Magnes[R]> So cute
<Vordox> You use 2, 3 or 5 fingers?
<NewDCD> 09,01not to mention that the whole execution downgrade obviously hurts my playstyle
<Kandarihu> The audio seems to be a slight bit ahead of the video.
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> NewDCD: what breed of dog you got?
<NewDCD> 09,01still experimenting
<hen3ry> what audio? I got none
<NewDCD> 09,01I think I'm probably going with one for 3
<Vordox> Hehe, alright alright
<NewDCD> 09,01Samoyed
<BronyBro> you beat it?
<hen3ry> oh, duh... had it muted lol
<Vordox> There's audio, jus tshame NewDCD can't lower the volume of the game so we can hear what he says during mid game
<hen3ry> livestream... no wonder
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Samoyeds are cute and fluffy
<Vordox> I hear your syllables now, that's a upgrade NewDCD :D

<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> LONG KICK
*Bronysith licks NewDCD
<Bronysith> hiya verypony
<Bronysith> everypony
<Vordox> Try and undergrip it, having 2 fingers on one side and 2 on the other side, with the thumb on the top/side around it, that's a coommon underhand grip, if you are able to that is.
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> hai Bronysith
<Sumica> 00,10kinda trippy
<MegaMoonShine> hiya Bronysith :)
<killerpony7733> Sumica hiya
<Vordox> Hai Mica
<hen3ry> fire travels at 1 m/s. Arms travel at speed of light
<BronyBro> so intense
<Sumica> 00,10the game got like a slow down for learning mode or somthing?
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> hen3ry: seems legit
<Bronysith> http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxchgfQw4s1qf087qo1_1280.png
<Vordox> This is like looking at a kid with his new toy and testing out what works and what not. XD
<Sundaysmile> kicks to the shin can knock people out
<Sumica> 00,10oh how corect you are Vordox
<Vordox> There's so far....what...12 different grips?
<Vordox> And it's all about personal preferences.
<hen3ry> heresy. One of those grips somewhere out there is the One Grip, the Grip to Rule Them All.
<Vordox> Underhand gives more snappy movements, but above grip has a better execution
<Vordox> etc etc.
<Vordox> So it's both playstyle and preferences really. I'll stick with my DPAD. :P
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> IT"S MIKE TYSON

<cow334> we have diffrent ones

<Lightning-Quill> dpn't bring up that garbage
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> i'm beginning to dislike ti
<User0> RX-78-SweetieBot: fair enough

<Meanwhile> Nintendo annoys me. Same stack of games every couple years.
<NewDCD> 09,01also taking your eyes away from your main screen is a pretty great way to kill immersion
<Spade-Magnes[R]> And yet they sell
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: What about the new Paper Mario game?
<NewDCD> 09,01I used to like Nintendo
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> My group home.

<cow334> awesome Dovah
<WindWhistler> I'm so confused! @_@
<alexxm> i'm good TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Shizupuddle> 13i don't see why steam doesn't allow resales, would just be a matter of moving the license
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> thanks for stream NewDCD
<Shizupuddle> 13course you would want to have something built in to prevent fraud but should be simple ja?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> maybe the will at least in the uk
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: That's an accurate depiction of how psychopaths work in society.
*Bronysith sits on TheGreatAndPowerfulT
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: how are you today?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> not so sure in the U.S
<Meanwhile> Gutted for you.
<Shizupuddle> 13they're halfway there with the inventory
<Shizupuddle> 13just need to be able to take games you have and put them into inventory
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: Oh. I thought she was acting that way on purpose. So she's really just has bad social skills?
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> they could just add a cut for steam and another one for the developer
<Lightning-Quill> what yo playing?
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> OW FUCK!
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I'm REALLY beginning to dislike Bandcamp
<alexxm> Pinkies4thWall|Sick what happened
*Pinkies4thWall|Sick just burned his hand on his computer
<cow334> lawl
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> that link killed Shamrocs xD
<Meanwhile> WindWhistler: She's a psychopath, she doesn't comprehend emotional reaction.
<Shizupuddle> 13or maybe like
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> hai Bronysith i'm good and you ?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> name hime DOCTOR
<Shizupuddle> 13pay $5 to take the game from your library and put it in inventory
<User0> Pinkies4thWall|Sick: I got a 2nd degree burn from my laptop... still have a mark from it...
<Shizupuddle> 13then trade/gift from there as usual
<WindWhistler> Meanwhile: Oh, I thought that term sounded familiar.
<Bronysith> TheGreatAndPowerfulT: good. just enjoying the bronystate
<Shamroc> well then
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> I now will never use bandcamp, because it doesn't work
<WindWhistler> User0: How do you burn your hand on a computer? Is it a laptop?
<Shizupuddle> 13so steam gets something out of it but doesn't make you buy a full price copy, and the original guy doesn't get to keep playing it
<Shizupuddle> 13just like real sales
<User0> WindWhistler: laptop.
<WindWhistler> User0: Ah. That's more understandable.
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> ^this make it happen shizu
<Meanwhile> Is this topic a big deal in some way?
<NewDCD> 09,01>Catherine is $20 on PSN
<NewDCD> 09,01AWW SHEET NEEGA
<TheGreatAndPowerfulT> oh wait Meanwhile is the leader of steam, make it happen Meanwhile
<Shizupuddle> 13or they could be all valve-y and say it's 10% what the game costs in the store at that time
<User0> WindWhistler: I halfway threw a router because my friend plugged in a very wrong power cable into it and it was REALLY hot.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> yay.....
<Bronysith> http://trollfacecomic.com/post/13735072988/troll-comics-extending-life
<WindWhistler> Ah.
<Shizupuddle> 13so like it would be $6 to trade away skyrim, but $2 to trade away l4d
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> nvm I found out what was wrong
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> User0: you could have been electrocuted there
<Shizupuddle> 13that wouldn't work... prices would just go up..
<cow334> NewDCD: xbox price : ONE MILLION DOLLAS
<Shamroc> oh vitural game trades/
<cow334> lawl
<User0> WindWhistler: he couldn't figure out why it wasn't responding... I figured it out quite quickly

<Meanwhile> Should be glad people even buy anything anymore when it ends up on Pirate Bay within half an hour of commercial release anyway.
<Shamroc> yep
<Shizupuddle> 13maybe $10 to trade out any game, which would encourage publishers to price under $10 so people buy a second copy rather than trade
<Meanwhile> And you better believe if I could download a pizza I would.
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> Sumica: what is the name of this song?
<Shizupuddle> 13http://i.imgur.com/1gA0I.jpg

<Lightning-Quill> pokemon ahh my childhood :'(
<EspyLacopa> People still buy games because at the end of the day, we want the programmers to make -more- games.
<EspyLacopa> They can't make more games if noone ever buys them.
<Shizupuddle> 13it was on right around when i started properly watching tv

<Spade-Magnes[R]> and then SAS craps out
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> july 4th celbrate american independance... by blowing shit up
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Eh....
<ekips> I wonder, how do they have a shuttle ramp when there is no city at all on the planet apparently?
<hen3ry> huh, I suppose I should break out my flag at some point.
<User0> ACK 9 errors became 209 errors!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> SPIN
<Everlasting_Joy> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Hey, we blew shit up when we fought GB, so it only makes sense we'd do it again.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Do a barrel roll
<Shizupuddle> 13oh
<hen3ry> Murica. Cause blowing up shit is awesum.
<User0> and 43 warnings became 269 warnings...
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Everlasting_Joy: GB?
<SeaponiesofLiverpool> exact same houses as Pokemon
<hen3ry> User0: quit programming and start debugging
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> And 269 bacame 599
<Everlasting_Joy> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: Great Britain.

<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> Everlasting_Joy: yea, sense make it does
<Everlasting_Joy> :)
<hen3ry> coming in low is part of any landing. It's just something you have to do
<dukedontnukem> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv5qzMtLE60
<dukedontnukem> what is this?
<hen3ry> they survived. Boo
<hen3ry> oh wait...
<hen3ry> darn
<dukedontnukem> what is the game
<ekips> "they survived" boom!
<MadSurge> Hey I know this music :D
<Shizupuddle> 13i do not have anything planned no
<alexxm> who gives them permission to survive
<dukedontnukem> garrys mod?
<alexxm> MadSurge wheres it from
<ekips> isn't this music from Star Wars?
<MadSurge> CMC gogogo :D
<hen3ry> lander design is optimistic
<Spade-Magnes[R]> The kerbals really need to make sea resistant crafts
<Vordox> I hear CMC theme
<hen3ry> I find wider landers are easier to land, btw
<MadSurge> Vordox: eeyup!
<alexxm> Vordox thats where its from?
<Vordox> alexxm: It's their Crusading Theme.
<MadSurge> alexxm: yes it is
<dukedontnukem> hey guys what would you pick out of these choices:minecraft singleplayer only portal 2 team fortress 2 or terraria?
<alexxm> thanks Vordox
<ekips> gah, mosquito in my room...
<dukedontnukem> awwwwwwwwwwwww yeaaaaaaaaaah
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ekips: kill it with bullets
<Everlasting_Joy> Spectrum_Rush|Zzz: :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> this will end badly
<alexxm> ekips try to get it out with bug spray and a zippo lighter
<dukedontnukem> later
<Shamroc> moop
<hen3ry> actually it's a reasonable design, so far.
<ekips> I already loaded my laser to kill it
<GarrettBrony> in kerbal Space Program. is there a warp drive option?
<Everlasting_Joy> I'ma fir'n mah laz0r!
<hen3ry> GarrettBrony: you can warp time but not travel faster than light
<alexxm> GarrettBrony i have no idea sorry
<BronyBro> nice music :P
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ekips: ok then 360 no scope yy ladder stall fakesey hadshot it
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> in one try
<GarrettBrony> are they going to stream any moar BoB
<ekips> I ballshot it, does that count Spectrum_Rush|Zzz ? :3
<Everlasting_Joy> I wonder the budget the Kerbal Space Program gets. I could only imagine the insane amount of money it would take to get some of these ships off the ground.
<Marx> Well, Looking at Star Fox 64 3D for the first time. Yes the graphics are nice, but for one, the voice acting just doesn't beat the original.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> ekips: close enough :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Oh who cares
<MadSurge> This franchise made me listen to a ton of new music genres :D Isn't there reggae pony music yet?
<BronyBro> wat r we watching?
<hen3ry> fortunately they found most of these parts on the side of a road somewhere
<BronyBro> what is this?
<killerpony7733> Everlasting_Joy: I think they tax the whole planet for it all so thats how they get the money back :D
<EggWhite> Hey, how is everpony doing?
<Everlasting_Joy> killerpony7733: :D
<BronyBro> fine you?
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> BronyBro: Sumica's killing kerbals
<hen3ry> and the ones they didn't are cheap. For instance the solid rockets are really just trash cans full of dynamite.
<GarrettBrony> I really want to see this thing take off
<MadSurge> BronyBro: we're watching Sumica play Kerbal Space Program
<alexxm> Everlasting_Joy since it seems to be the only thing on the planet it gets everything
<BronyBro> mk
<Sumica> 00,10wait, did I put an sas?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> AKA watch sumica slaughter kerbals
<hen3ry> no sas
<alexxm> hry EggWhite i'm good how about you
<Shamroc> Sumica: nice one
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> nope
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WELP
<EggWhite> BronyBro: I'm good.
<EggWhite> alexxm: I'm good.
<BronyBro> so wat r ur opinions on derpy
<Sumica> 00,10manual flight mode it is then
<GarrettBrony> you mean the Derpy doll?
<Irish_Pony> :D
<EggWhite> でrpy位sごおｄ
<hen3ry> you know those Kerbals can't fly a paper plane, much less a rocket...
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> wat could go wrong
<BronyBro> i mean how they took her name away and stuff
<EggWhite> damn sorry
<Spade-Magnes[R]> this i will end in TOTAL FAILURE
<BronyBro> :O
<EggWhite> I changed the wrong program to Japanese
<GarrettBrony> BronyBro I thought it sucked. But I am ok with changing her original voice though
<Spade-Magnes[R]> BOOM
<hen3ry> that looks like success to me.
<hen3ry> lots of booms anyway
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> WUT
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Awwww they lived
<Pinkies4thWall|Sick> NO
<Everlasting_Joy> And suddenly, they'll blow up. . . what?
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Damn
<User0> not nearly enough boom!
<BronyBro> it could have been 20%cooler but it wasnt a failure
<Barbetos|Atwork> The combine!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> MOAR THRUSTERS
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> tis a nice design Sumica
<hen3ry> no sas on lander?
<hen3ry> it ain't landing then :D
<alexxm> how about we go on a rescue luna mission
<PsychoticDoc> this game is harder than anything i ever played
<BronyBro> not bad...
<User0> I just reverted a few days worth of changes with about 8 mouse clicks...
<GarrettBrony> well we need some Saturn V rockets and a Lunar Mission Module for one alexxm
<hen3ry> bad idea Sumi.
<Spectrum_Rush|Zzz> lets see Lunas been rescued atleast 3 times by Phase4 on stream not sure about Sumica or Nittany_Discord
<hen3ry> don't the central and side ones detach at the same time?
<alexxm> thansk GarrettBrony
<BronyBro> yay!
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Eh who cares
<GabeMoist> I missed every moon landing
<PsychoticDoc> i only ever played the demo though...
<GarrettBrony> GabeMoist I did too
<BronyBro> :O
<Sumica> 00,10seem to have lost the center line rocket
<Michael> hai everypony :D

<Baily> Hey guys can anyone tell me what the movie night time is in GMT?? Sorry I'm not sure how to find out :(
<hen3ry> i hate it when that happens. my shuttle keeps having the same stupid thing happen to it
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Space does not exist
<GarrettBrony> yay. I guess if it was a AAA there would have been a lot moar shooting and day one Add ons and DRM
<Everlasting_Joy> Baily: It's GMT -4 with DST in effect.
<Shizupuddle> 13don't look at the countdown timer above the stream whatever you do
<hen3ry> Spade-Magnes[R]: You will never get to space.
<alexxm> Baily they're on at midnight in english time if that helps
<Spade-Magnes[R]> What
<Spade-Magnes[R]> erm
<Spade-Magnes[R]> What
<Iron_Edge> Shizupuddle: ok that one was kinda unneccesary >:3
<Baily> alexxm: thank you that's perfect :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> TO EARTH
<User0> Iron_Edge: It was witty though... give a little credit.
<alexxm> Baily so where in england are you then
<PsychoticDoc> No, stop, what are you doing!?
<Iron_Edge> User0: Witty is something we can all laugh at. She just cracked him with the whip of witt.
<Michael> wat
<Iron_Edge> Also is anypony elses chat white???
<Sumica> 00,10any one can do a moon landing
<hen3ry> now THAT is optimism.
<Baily> alexxm: Habrough, near... trying to think of a big city you may recognize D: Grimsby maybe?? :L you??
<User0> Iron_Edge: I snickered...
<alexxm> mine isn't Iron_Edge
<hen3ry> you're not even close to having enough delta V unless you use the chute, and you can't use the chute without detaching the legs. What now?
<alexxm> Baily i'm in croydon it's just outside of london
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I can moon land.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Freeeeeeeeeeeee
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Freeeeeeeeee falllllin
<GarrettBrony> Nittany_Discord: Its pretty dusty on the moon
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01I know.
<Michael> gravity :D
<Nittany_Discord> 11,01They need me.
<Everlasting_Joy> Nittany_Discord: All you have to do is just bend your knees until you hit a hard surface, such as a chair.
*Spade-Magnes[R] dusts the moon
<Baily> alexxm: cool A friend of mine manages a Hotel near there, at least he did last time I spoke to him :P
<killerpony7733> Iron_Edge: Text is white on a black background for me
<killerpony7733> Iron_Edge: Also hi :)
<hen3ry> at the last second, jump up.
<alexxm> ok Baily
<Iron_Edge> User0: Your a techy with a mad mans desire for knowledge. You would chuckle at someone who broke there leg. >:3
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Spinzaku!
<Iron_Edge> killerpony7733: Well mine is revers
<Iron_Edge> killerpony7733: White background with black text 0.0
<User0> Iron_Edge: breaking a leg is slightly more significant than breaking code (me accidently having 9 errors become over 200 errors is funny, on the other hand...)
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Going way too fast
<killerpony7733> Iron_Edge: Interesting :D
<Spade-Magnes[R]> BRACE FOR IMPACT
<Sumica> 00,10had too much rcs fuel
<Spade-Magnes[R]> WELP
<Michael> :(
<Vordox> kapoof
<Sumica> 00,10might have had a chance if I used the chute to stablise
<hen3ry> chute would make it trivial.
*Spade-Magnes[R] plays taps
<Sumica> 00,10nah the chutes have a weight limit
<Iron_Edge> User0: See I dont even understand anything you just said about code. Cause Iz a blacksmith :3 but my point being was she could have just said check the clock. Not assault the new guy >:3
<hen3ry> it slows you to about 20 m/s, from whence the RCS would have enough delta-V to get you below 10.
<Sumica> 00,10unless you can drop speed below 13mps you die
<Michael> screw the countdown
<Kirz|zombies> 8,6I have to work :'(
<GabeMoist> Sumica, what about 13.1 mps?
<Sumica> 00,10is that below?
<VenHur96> Hi everypony!
<Iron_Edge> User0: Thats like if you decided to do blacksmithing seriously and because what you do is chain mail...(rookie stuff) I tore you down and as you say wittly commented on everything you did.
<Iron_Edge> User0: Just unnecesary. -lol
<Michael> hai VenHur96
<PsychoticDoc> sup
<Spade-Magnes[R]> Once you get below 13mps your gonna see some serious shit
<VenHur96> ^
<Iron_Edge> User0: Or vice versa and I did programming and you attacked me over everthing I didnt know.....Which is everything about programming :D
<PsychoticDoc> You should atach MOAR THRUSTERS!!!
<GabeMoist> so 12.9 mps = safe and 13.1 mps = death?
<Sumica> 00,10wait....
<hen3ry> er
<hen3ry> who stole his engine?
<Quick_Thinker> hey guys i just updated my fic of QuickThinker on FIMfic you can read it of you want to

<Sumica> 00,10well if you did't insist on it having toes
<Saturn> 08,01Magical_pablez94: depends on if it's a repeat offence
<Kammerjunk> Saturn: You could always paint them yourself.

<Saturn> 08,01Kammerjunk: i might
<Magical_pablez94> Saturn ...mmh okay.
<Sumica> 00,10depends alot on the spam too
<GabeMoist> Kammerjunk, That's what I aaid

<GabeMoist> Sumica, that's the thing about cans of spam, you don't know what the content is
<flutter-scruff> hi everyone
<hen3ry> generally cans of spam have spam in them
<GabeMoist> it's this mysterious type of meat
<Michael> hai flutter-scruff
<hen3ry> they don't have to be identified further than that. "vaguely meat based possibly" is good enough.
<Spade-Magnes[R]> http://derpy.me/8-Kly
<GabeMoist> So posting spam cans is instant ban then?
<Iron_Edge> User0: Thats cause your not the knew guy. Ya' tech wizard violin playin, plasma genius!

<VenHur96> More like Soviet Russia then Itally...
<StinkomanFan> Who's streaming? I know another Freeware game he'd love
<Barbetos|Atwork> Baked yam for a plot. Disturbing!
<Eagle3302> In soviet russia, the scooter rides you...
